WEBVTT

00:01.580 --> 00:03.499
We need to talk about what happened.

00:03.500 --> 00:06.369
Jordan and Nina, that's a
bunch of crap I can't change.

00:06.370 --> 00:10.289
How about I take you to dinner
and we not talk business?

00:10.290 --> 00:12.369
When we move out of The Bixby..

00:12.370 --> 00:14.459
I was thinking I'd just crash
at Cassie and Adam's for a bit.

00:14.460 --> 00:15.459
Hi, guys.

00:15.460 --> 00:17.459
The actors were avoiding you
on purpose.

00:17.460 --> 00:20.409
That was quite the
little stunt you pulled.

00:20.410 --> 00:21.539
Wait, is that..

00:21.540 --> 00:23.499
'The role's yours,
Vera, if you want it.'

00:23.500 --> 00:25.669
Of course, I want it.
And by the way, it's Billy.

00:25.670 --> 00:27.669
Here you go. It's an anonymous gift.

00:27.670 --> 00:30.459
I am supposed to give you this.

00:30.460 --> 00:32.530

01:14.370 --> 01:16.579
- Sorry, were my hands cold?
- No, it's all good.

01:16.580 --> 01:19.709
That was great. Really great.

01:19.710 --> 01:22.369
So, uh, we got just enough time
for touch-ups

01:22.370 --> 01:23.669
before we do your coverage, Paige.

01:23.670 --> 01:24.709
Great job, you two.

01:24.710 --> 01:26.579
- Thanks, Tasha.
- Thanks.

01:26.580 --> 01:28.289
Probably best to keep you two here.

01:28.290 --> 01:29.709
We're gonna just tweak up
the lights. Okay?

01:29.710 --> 01:31.530
Sure.

01:35.500 --> 01:38.369
So I saw the Backsplash reunion?

01:38.370 --> 01:39.499
- Well?
- Yeah.

01:39.500 --> 01:40.579
I think it's really awesome

01:40.580 --> 01:42.669
that you're so into this charity.

01:42.670 --> 01:45.749
I should probably do
something charitable.

01:45.750 --> 01:48.579
You can start by coming
to my fundraiser tomorrow night.

01:48.580 --> 01:51.409
- Never did get your RSVP.
- I know. I can't.

01:51.410 --> 01:53.579
I have a screen test the next morning.

01:53.580 --> 01:56.329
Yeah? What for?

01:56.330 --> 01:58.669
I'm not really allowed to say.

01:58.670 --> 02:00.749
Oh, come on.

02:00.750 --> 02:03.329
No one's killing me.
I wanna tell you so bad.

02:03.330 --> 02:05.249
It's Martin Scorsese's next film.

02:05.250 --> 02:07.579
He's not gonna be there.
But still, it's a screen test.

02:07.580 --> 02:10.408
Oh! No, that's huge.

02:10.410 --> 02:11.619
What's the part?

02:11.620 --> 02:14.409
Boudica. Do you know who that is?

02:14.410 --> 02:18.329
She's like a female Braveheart.

02:18.330 --> 02:19.539
Yeah, I got a photo.

02:19.540 --> 02:24.499
She's a Celtic warrior in 61 AD.

02:24.500 --> 02:26.289
'She fought off the Romans.'

02:26.290 --> 02:28.669
She had long, pretty red hair
and she kicked ass.

02:28.670 --> 02:31.539
- Sounds perfect for you.
- Thank you.

02:31.540 --> 02:33.539
It's nice to see
the girl from Portland, Oregon

02:33.540 --> 02:35.579
still excited to be here.

02:35.580 --> 02:37.579
Not jaded in Hollywood.

02:37.580 --> 02:41.329
This is a really great role.
Oh, I want it so bad.

02:41.330 --> 02:44.409
And I've been working nonstop
with my trainer.

02:44.410 --> 02:45.749
I've been eating chicken breast

02:45.750 --> 02:47.499
and egg whites for the last week.

02:47.500 --> 02:48.669
And then it's gone.

02:48.670 --> 02:51.329
Now you sound just like every
other actress in Hollywood.

02:51.330 --> 02:53.329
- Ah! Hey!
- You do.

02:53.330 --> 02:54.709
Are you two ready?

02:54.710 --> 02:57.369
We're gonna pick it up
from the last position. Okay?

02:57.370 --> 02:59.870
- Okay.
- We're ready, Laura?

03:01.790 --> 03:03.610
Thank you.

03:08.330 --> 03:09.579
'Go to bell. Roll sound.'

03:12.290 --> 03:15.700
- 'Marker.'
- 'And... action!'

03:52.580 --> 03:55.579
Sloane, hi!

03:55.580 --> 03:57.329
- How are you?
- Oh, God.

03:57.330 --> 03:59.669
You weren't kidding.
This is like a serious circus.

03:59.670 --> 04:01.329
What are you guys doing here?

04:01.330 --> 04:05.409
We are shooting content
for my new Alexilicious app

04:05.410 --> 04:07.459
and we've been going for four hours.

04:07.460 --> 04:09.709
- Ida, I think we're done here.
- Alright.

04:09.710 --> 04:11.329
Okay, let's turn the lights out

04:11.330 --> 04:13.289
and, uh, keep the set hot
just like this.

04:13.290 --> 04:15.579
Yeah, I have a
set, not a home now.

04:15.580 --> 04:17.459
Come here.

04:17.459 --> 04:19.459
- Mm, it's so good to see you.
- I know.

04:19.459 --> 04:21.490
Tell me everything.

04:23.000 --> 04:29.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:36.330 --> 04:39.289
I was really hoping
Brian would be wrong.

04:39.290 --> 04:41.740
- Let's take five.
- 'Yeah.'

04:44.370 --> 04:46.669
I know what you're doing
and it's clear suicide.

04:46.670 --> 04:48.709
You can't go against
Gold Brothers like this.

04:48.710 --> 04:51.409
They went against me when they
dropped my Oscar campaign.

04:51.410 --> 04:52.499
I deserve that nomination.

04:52.500 --> 04:54.619
I know you do, but you can't do this.

04:54.620 --> 04:56.669
What's the big deal?
I'm spending my own money

04:56.670 --> 04:59.369
on my own Oscar push.
I don't see the problem.

04:59.370 --> 05:00.749
The problem is,
you don't have Gold Brothers

05:00.750 --> 05:02.709
and their team of lawyers
protecting you.

05:02.710 --> 05:05.459
Now every single one
of your competitors is

05:05.460 --> 05:08.789
is going to do their best
to dig up more scandal.

05:08.790 --> 05:11.709
And just you and me.

05:11.710 --> 05:14.409
I mean, talk
about shoot the messenger.

05:14.410 --> 05:17.409
It aired and suddenly I'm the outcast

05:17.410 --> 05:20.329
and I wasn't even the one
who screwed Rainer's mom.

05:20.330 --> 05:23.499
Lex, I literally had no idea
this was going on.

05:23.500 --> 05:26.409
You don't watch my show?

05:26.410 --> 05:27.669
I will, I promise.

05:27.670 --> 05:30.499
I'm sorry. It's just my last
semester at Yale was so hectic.

05:30.500 --> 05:32.369
Is it really that bad?

05:32.370 --> 05:33.709
It's worse than the
epic showdown I had

05:33.710 --> 05:35.619
with my mom and sister
three years ago.

05:35.620 --> 05:38.289
Are you kidding? They're still
not talking to you?

05:38.290 --> 05:41.709
Oh, no, but they have no problem
cashing my checks still.

05:41.710 --> 05:44.579
I swear, Sloane, you should
thank your dad every day

05:44.580 --> 05:46.539
for not letting you be a child actor.

05:46.540 --> 05:47.669
So even Tangey?

05:47.670 --> 05:50.289
Won't talk to me. Won't take my calls.

05:50.290 --> 05:52.579
Look, I know it's bad, Lex,
but I'm sure you can smooth

05:52.580 --> 05:54.820
things over with everyone
at Rainer's party.

05:56.540 --> 05:58.539
What party?

05:58.540 --> 06:01.669
Oh, Rainer's big save-the-ocean party.

06:01.670 --> 06:03.669
- Um...
- What?

06:03.670 --> 06:06.249
Were you not invited to this?

06:06.250 --> 06:08.289
No.

06:08.290 --> 06:11.579
And I gave money
to his stupid dolphin bullshit.

06:11.580 --> 06:14.539
You know, Alexis could really use

06:14.540 --> 06:17.249
the new best friend for Alexilicious.

06:17.250 --> 06:19.249
Now that Tangey isn't talking to her.

06:19.250 --> 06:22.369
Okay, Ida, Sloane is my real
friend in real life.

06:22.370 --> 06:25.289
Oh, well, good, keep that up.

06:25.290 --> 06:28.669
And by the way, you need to go
to that party with your cameras.

06:28.670 --> 06:31.409
Uh, no. Are you kidding?

06:31.410 --> 06:32.669
No one is gonna make up with me

06:32.670 --> 06:35.459
if I show up with my cameras. No.

06:35.460 --> 06:37.369
Listen, that's what
your fans wanna see.

06:37.370 --> 06:39.539
That's your season two pickup
right there.

06:39.540 --> 06:41.539
How? It's my last day
shooting "Locked"

06:41.540 --> 06:42.749
and Rainer still won't talk to me.

06:42.750 --> 06:44.749
You don't need him to talk to you.

06:44.750 --> 06:47.450
You just need to make him listen.

06:48.500 --> 06:51.329
'Please talk to me.'

06:51.330 --> 06:53.369
Please say something.

06:53.370 --> 06:55.780
Damn it, just say something!

06:59.620 --> 07:01.669
It's no use.

07:01.670 --> 07:03.499
They're gone.

07:09.710 --> 07:12.660
'And cut! Lighten up!'

07:13.500 --> 07:14.619
Let me guess.

07:14.620 --> 07:16.910
You had the devilled eggs
off crafty this morning?

07:19.620 --> 07:22.369
Rainer, wait.
I need to talk to you for real.

07:22.370 --> 07:24.579
And that's a wrap on Alexis Glenn

07:24.580 --> 07:25.749
as Maggie, everyone.

07:25.750 --> 07:28.329
Let's give her a round of applause.

07:42.670 --> 07:44.539
Rainer!

07:44.540 --> 07:45.749
Rainer!

07:45.750 --> 07:48.789
- Rainer, stop. Come on.
- What?

07:48.790 --> 07:50.539
I was kind of hurt
that you didn't invite me

07:50.540 --> 07:52.289
to your fundraiser.

07:52.290 --> 07:53.459
What gives?

07:53.460 --> 07:55.709
Do I really need
to spell it out for you?

07:55.710 --> 07:57.499
No one wants you there.

07:57.500 --> 07:59.249
Well, that's what I'm trying to fix

07:59.250 --> 08:02.289
but I can't if everyone keeps
ostracizing me.

08:02.290 --> 08:04.780
Rainer, please, I supported
your cause. You owe me.

08:06.250 --> 08:09.499
Thanks for your donation,
but I owe you nothing.

08:09.500 --> 08:12.329
Look, I'm sorry.

08:12.330 --> 08:15.669
I really... am, okay?

08:15.670 --> 08:18.579
And if I could take it back,
trust me, I would.

08:18.580 --> 08:21.539
But I was just a messenger
in this situation

08:21.540 --> 08:25.749
so I really wish that you and
everyone else would just stop..

08:25.750 --> 08:28.530
...stop hating me so much.

08:29.790 --> 08:32.820
I don't hate you, Alexis.

08:33.750 --> 08:36.409
I get that it's in your nature.

08:36.409 --> 08:39.909
Like when animals in the wild
sometimes eat their young.

08:42.409 --> 08:44.490
So can I come?

08:45.500 --> 08:47.749
Fine, but not with cameras.

08:47.750 --> 08:49.579
But my show is doing killer ratings

08:49.580 --> 08:50.579
and it could bring
a lot of attention...

08:50.580 --> 08:53.669
No cameras, Alexis.

08:53.670 --> 08:56.740
This isn't a Hollywood party.
It's a fundraiser.

08:57.620 --> 08:58.910
Okay.

09:05.080 --> 09:06.249
Tighten up your target area.

09:06.250 --> 09:08.209
Don't forget the legs, sweetie.

09:19.170 --> 09:21.039
Good job.

09:21.040 --> 09:23.370
- Alright, let's take a break.
- Thanks.

09:27.250 --> 09:29.869
So Boudica often would fall
from her horse.

09:29.870 --> 09:33.119
She'd use a spear, dagger,
and sometimes a sword

09:33.120 --> 09:35.829
but never a phone.

09:35.830 --> 09:37.119
Sorry.

09:37.120 --> 09:39.079
What's going on? Jake still MIA?

09:39.080 --> 09:42.079
Yes, and look how many boxes
there are left to unpack.

09:42.080 --> 09:43.909
I mean, he is worse than the cable guy

09:43.910 --> 09:47.039
because at least
that guy actually showed up.

09:47.040 --> 09:49.829
Now this is great.

09:49.830 --> 09:50.909
How is this great?

09:50.910 --> 09:52.909
We can use all this pent-up rage

09:52.910 --> 09:55.079
to channel it into your fighting.

09:55.080 --> 09:57.079
Okay. Bring it on.

09:57.080 --> 10:00.249
Alright. I'm gonna show you
a windpipe jab.

10:00.250 --> 10:04.039
One strategic punch
can take your opponent down.

10:04.040 --> 10:05.959
I'm only gonna show you
if you promise not to use it

10:05.960 --> 10:08.039
on your flaky boyfriend.

10:08.040 --> 10:09.249
I can't promise anything.

10:15.750 --> 10:17.950
- The sound speeding?
- 'Speeding.'

10:19.170 --> 10:21.950
Alright, take your time
on this one, okay, guys?

10:23.960 --> 10:26.370
And... action.

10:27.910 --> 10:30.410
We did it. We did it.

10:44.210 --> 10:47.200
- What's wrong?
- What have we done?

10:48.830 --> 10:50.110
What?

10:53.080 --> 10:55.160
What have we done?

11:02.870 --> 11:04.240
Cut.

11:08.040 --> 11:10.119
Wow.

11:10.120 --> 11:12.079
Wait, was it good?

11:12.080 --> 11:15.249
- No, no. That was incredible.
- Okay.

11:15.250 --> 11:17.209
Let's, uh, turn around
on Shane's coverage.

11:17.210 --> 11:19.030
Great.

11:27.870 --> 11:31.200
- That was really good.
- Thanks.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.829
Everything okay?
You keep checkin' that thing.

11:36.830 --> 11:40.200
Supposed to help Paige unpack boxes.

11:41.080 --> 11:42.169
Did she just move today?

11:42.170 --> 11:45.169
Uh, no. Four days ago.

11:45.170 --> 11:46.789
And you haven't been there yet?

11:46.790 --> 11:47.869
Well, how could I?

11:47.870 --> 11:49.119
It's been like 14-hour days here.

11:49.120 --> 11:51.909
Alright, I'm gonna give you
the girl perspective here.

11:51.910 --> 11:53.789
She just bought a house

11:53.790 --> 11:56.039
super big move in her life,
four days ago

11:56.040 --> 11:57.999
and you haven't even been there
with flowers

11:58.000 --> 12:01.289
or a candle or your muscles, nothing?

12:01.290 --> 12:03.909
I'll just text her
and tell her we're on a roll.

12:03.910 --> 12:06.160
She's an actress.
I'm sure she will understand.

12:07.120 --> 12:09.160
- Ahem.
- Okay.

12:10.250 --> 12:14.079
Come on, give me a break.
You know he's staying here.

12:14.080 --> 12:16.079
I know he's staying here.

12:16.080 --> 12:18.249
Can you just let me leave the card?

12:18.250 --> 12:20.959
It's from a bunch of little kids.

12:20.960 --> 12:22.909
Hello?

12:22.910 --> 12:26.999
It's not like I'm some
crazed, rabid Jordan Wilder fan.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.079
You sure about that? 'Cause you look

12:29.080 --> 12:32.119
a lot like some of my crazed
rabid fans right now.

12:32.120 --> 12:33.999
- Hi.
- 'Hey.'

12:34.000 --> 12:37.079
Um, this is for you.

12:37.080 --> 12:39.039
- Oh, oh.
- From the kids.

12:39.040 --> 12:40.829
They loved their beach day.

12:40.830 --> 12:42.789
Which is why
this took so long to make.

12:42.790 --> 12:44.999
They wanted to make it extra good.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.039
Tell them it's extra,
extra good. I love it.

12:48.040 --> 12:49.959
Well, I'm sure you're busy so...

12:49.960 --> 12:53.169
Oh, I, I wish I would have known
you were stoppin' by.

12:53.170 --> 12:54.959
Wait, what about tomorrow night?

12:54.960 --> 12:56.999
- Are you free?
- For what?

12:57.000 --> 12:59.789
Um, going to a fundraiser
for Trending Ocean.

12:59.790 --> 13:01.209
You like a good cause, right?

13:01.210 --> 13:03.909
- I don't know, Jordan.
- Come on, tell me.

13:03.910 --> 13:06.909
Well, what about
you and Tangey Turner?

13:06.910 --> 13:09.209
We're done. Over. Ancient history.

13:09.210 --> 13:11.869
Plus, I'm not even
asking you out on a date.

13:11.870 --> 13:14.829
It's a fundraiser.
Strictly not a date.

13:14.830 --> 13:16.209
Well, if it's not a date

13:16.210 --> 13:20.169
and for a good cause,
I guess I could come.

13:20.170 --> 13:22.169
Good. Meet me here at 6:00.

13:22.170 --> 13:24.119
Oh, and ask for Joe Miller.

13:24.120 --> 13:26.869
Denzel's character in "Philadelphia."

13:26.870 --> 13:28.320
See, I got layers.

13:31.680 --> 13:33.759
Well, you always knew
how to pick your wines.

13:33.760 --> 13:35.849
- Ah.
- Thank you.

13:35.850 --> 13:38.574
So I went to a screening
of your last film

13:38.575 --> 13:40.284
and it is going to sweep...

13:40.285 --> 13:41.404
No, no, no.

13:41.405 --> 13:43.664
No business talk. We agreed.

13:43.665 --> 13:46.494
Great. Okay.

13:46.495 --> 13:47.865
Well..

13:52.365 --> 13:55.614
So, are you still,
um, into extreme sports?

13:55.615 --> 13:57.614
It was kiteboarding?

13:57.615 --> 13:59.404
How's Rainer?

13:59.405 --> 14:02.324
Well, I wouldn't know.
We're in one of those

14:02.325 --> 14:04.324
I'm-never-gonna
talk-to-you-again phases.

14:04.325 --> 14:06.664
Sloane and I survived
a number of those.

14:06.665 --> 14:10.454
Well, our kids, they're adults
and you gotta let 'em fall

14:10.455 --> 14:13.614
and you gotta let them pick
themselves back up again.

14:13.615 --> 14:15.664
Well, Rainer has been
spending a lotta time

14:15.665 --> 14:17.404
on the ground lately

14:17.405 --> 14:19.744
making one bad choice after the next.

14:19.745 --> 14:23.494
Ah, throwing his money
at this rehab girl's charity?

14:23.495 --> 14:26.404
Can you believe this little minx
roped him into hosting

14:26.405 --> 14:29.324
a lavish fundraiser at his house?

14:29.325 --> 14:32.664
Tryin' to save the planet. That
sounds pretty healthy to me.

14:32.665 --> 14:35.454
Like to be my date for this thing?

14:35.455 --> 14:38.364
- You got an invite?
- Actually, I'm crashing.

14:38.365 --> 14:40.284
But I think it'll be okay
if I come bearing

14:40.285 --> 14:42.454
a peace offering with many zeros.

14:42.455 --> 14:44.784
You're not crashing
his fundraiser. No, you..

14:44.785 --> 14:46.364
You're gonna give him space

14:46.365 --> 14:48.574
and you are gonna respect
his boundaries.

14:48.575 --> 14:49.744
Boundaries?

14:56.745 --> 14:59.284
Hey, stranger, long time no see.

14:59.285 --> 15:02.284
- How's your new place?
- Ah, it's, it's great.

15:02.285 --> 15:04.664
- Um, is Jake up front?
- Uh-huh.

15:04.665 --> 15:09.534
Look, between us, Billy's good,
but I prefer you as Georgia.

15:09.535 --> 15:11.744
Without you,
the film's lost somethin'.

15:11.745 --> 15:15.244
- Thank you.
- Stop by The Bixby some time.

15:15.245 --> 15:17.364
- I'll give you a free drink.
- That's so sweet.

15:17.365 --> 15:19.614
Thank you. You got a deal.

15:19.615 --> 15:21.865
- It was nice seeing you, Shane.
- Mm-hmm.

15:25.575 --> 15:28.534
- Hey.
- Oh, Paige, hi.

15:28.535 --> 15:30.494
Paige, I'm so sorry.

15:30.495 --> 15:31.614
We had to get through
eight pages today.

15:31.615 --> 15:33.364
I promise I'll make it up to you.

15:36.365 --> 15:38.324
Good to know your phone does work.

15:38.325 --> 15:40.445
Hey, Matt. Yeah, yeah.

15:42.575 --> 15:44.574
You look great. How has it been going?

15:44.575 --> 15:46.574
Really great.
We got some amazing stuff.

15:46.575 --> 15:48.494
I can't wait for you to see it.

15:48.495 --> 15:50.454
I bet. I'm excited.

15:50.455 --> 15:54.284
No, no, no, no, we're 13 days
into a 20-day shoot.

15:54.285 --> 15:57.284
No, this is way past last minute.

15:57.285 --> 15:58.574
'Okay.'

15:58.575 --> 16:00.614
Alright.

16:00.615 --> 16:02.865
Alright, thanks for letting me know.

16:07.745 --> 16:09.784
Our biggest investor just dropped out.

16:09.785 --> 16:11.614
What? Why?

16:11.615 --> 16:14.454
Because we no longer have
a name to fill the role.

16:14.455 --> 16:17.364
We don't have enough money
to finish the film.

16:17.365 --> 16:19.655
So, "Stealing Georgia's" dead.

16:34.455 --> 16:37.284
Oh, freak.

16:37.285 --> 16:39.494
I can't find this waffle maker
anywhere.

16:39.495 --> 16:41.494
- So we'll go out.
- I don't wanna go out.

16:41.495 --> 16:42.704
I wanna cook in my kitchen

16:42.705 --> 16:44.664
which I've been waiting to do
for a week.

16:44.665 --> 16:46.404
It has not been a week.

16:46.405 --> 16:48.324
Ugh, it's almost been an entire week

16:48.325 --> 16:50.404
and last night was the first
time you came over, so..

16:50.405 --> 16:51.454
Paige, you should have wrapped these

16:51.455 --> 16:52.614
in bubble wrap
or newspaper or something...

16:52.615 --> 16:54.905
They're plates. Who cares?

16:56.535 --> 16:59.404
I'm sorry. Okay?

16:59.405 --> 17:01.664
Jake, I'm sorry
that your investors pulled out

17:01.665 --> 17:04.243
because I'm not in "Georgia" anymore.

17:04.244 --> 17:05.743
I didn't have a choice
to go back to "Locked"

17:05.744 --> 17:09.404
but you had a choice.
You decided not to wait for me.

17:09.405 --> 17:10.404
Yeah, maybe I should go.

17:10.405 --> 17:12.605
I don't think
I'm helping you much here.

17:17.494 --> 17:19.324
Wait, uh..

17:19.325 --> 17:23.704
Um, Rainer is, is having
a fundraiser tonight

17:23.704 --> 17:26.404
for Trending Ocean.

17:26.405 --> 17:28.324
Okay. Are you going?

17:28.325 --> 17:30.704
No, I-I wasn't going to
'cause I have that screen test

17:30.705 --> 17:33.284
tomorrow morning, but..

17:33.285 --> 17:36.704
...I'm sure there will be
a lotta producers there.

17:36.705 --> 17:38.704
Isn't that how these things
usually work?

17:38.705 --> 17:43.485
We could schmooze a little
a-and find you your funding.

17:45.325 --> 17:47.865
Yeah. Yeah, maybe.

17:51.745 --> 17:54.494
Do you think Billy could come?

17:54.495 --> 17:57.735
- Why?
- I mean, she's a producer.

17:59.495 --> 18:02.534
- Well, I wasn't a producer.
- Paige, it's not a big deal.

18:02.535 --> 18:04.744
She's also the boom operator
and makes lasagna for the crew.

18:04.745 --> 18:06.664
Okay.

18:06.665 --> 18:09.605
Yeah, I'm sure it's fine.
I'll ask Rainer.

18:16.325 --> 18:17.695
Hey, I'm sorry.

18:22.365 --> 18:24.485
I'm sorry too.

18:37.575 --> 18:39.605
Hey, you're early.

18:43.455 --> 18:45.744
Jordan Wilder. Pete Kumar,
entertainment blogger.

18:45.745 --> 18:47.574
Yo, this is my private residence now.

18:47.575 --> 18:50.404
Because Rainer Devon kicked you
out of the beach house.

18:50.405 --> 18:52.404
What do you want?

18:52.405 --> 18:55.534
Jordan Wilder, right?
Is that even your real name?

18:55.535 --> 18:57.364
Because one of our sources say
that you may have gone

18:57.365 --> 18:59.454
by the name Jordan Michaels.

18:59.455 --> 19:01.404
We have the school records
from the state of Illinois

19:01.405 --> 19:02.574
Chicago, actually, at the same time

19:02.575 --> 19:04.404
as your parents' death here in LA.

19:04.405 --> 19:05.574
Do you care to comment on that?

19:05.575 --> 19:07.744
Tell your sources to check
again. I grew up in LA.

19:07.745 --> 19:09.454
Now if you'll excuse me.

19:09.455 --> 19:10.574
Oh, but, Mr. Wilder

19:10.575 --> 19:11.614
I still have
a, a bunch more questions.

19:11.615 --> 19:13.324
It's just one minute.

19:13.325 --> 19:14.454
What was that about?

19:14.455 --> 19:16.244
They didn't let you in,
but that guy gets up here.

19:16.245 --> 19:17.534
That's unbelievable.

19:17.535 --> 19:20.655
But you said you grew up in Chicago.

19:23.665 --> 19:27.574
There's a public me and a private me.

19:27.575 --> 19:30.775
Okay. Well, which one of you
am I getting tonight?

19:31.705 --> 19:34.525
The real me. All of me.

19:36.495 --> 19:37.815
Good.

19:47.325 --> 19:48.494
Over here, on this table.

19:48.495 --> 19:52.284
Hey, I thought
we were having a juice bar.

19:52.285 --> 19:53.534
Are you serious?

19:53.535 --> 19:56.574
This is an open, very open bar.

19:56.575 --> 19:59.454
Yes, it is.

19:59.455 --> 20:01.454
Do you really think
that's a good idea?

20:01.455 --> 20:02.664
I mean, you and me, all this booze

20:02.665 --> 20:04.324
just a few weeks out of rehab?

20:04.325 --> 20:06.664
Rain, you need to trust me. Okay?

20:06.665 --> 20:09.525
Trust yourself. You can do this, okay?

20:12.325 --> 20:14.494
Rainer, people are gonna be here soon.

21:07.773 --> 21:09.032
- Hi.
- It's so good to see you.

21:09.033 --> 21:10.692
Yeah, it's good to see you too.

21:10.693 --> 21:13.862
Whoa! Whoa, whoa,
I told you no, Alexis.

21:13.863 --> 21:16.143
Oh, yeah, but she told me yes.

21:17.823 --> 21:19.942
You guys should talk.

21:19.943 --> 21:22.942
So we're doing Rainer's
little ocean thing.

21:22.943 --> 21:25.772
- 'Uh, it's super fun.'
- It will be fine.

21:25.773 --> 21:27.772
We need all the publicity
that we can get.

21:27.773 --> 21:29.982
Not this kind of publicity.

21:29.983 --> 21:31.072
Have you seen her show?

21:31.073 --> 21:34.032
No, but ten million viewers have.

21:34.033 --> 21:35.942
Baby, these numbers
can lay the groundwork

21:35.943 --> 21:38.023
for a national campaign.

21:38.943 --> 21:41.732
Next time, talk to me.

21:41.733 --> 21:44.072
I just wanna know
we're in this together.

21:44.073 --> 21:45.893
Okay.

21:52.943 --> 21:54.893
Cheers.

21:55.943 --> 21:57.902
I don't see Jordan or Tange yet.

21:57.903 --> 21:59.982
Don't worry, I'm sure
they're gonna be here, Lex.

21:59.983 --> 22:01.732
I hope so.

22:01.733 --> 22:03.942
I really wanna make things
right with them.

22:03.943 --> 22:05.862
See you. Thanks very much.

22:12.033 --> 22:13.982
Paige.

22:13.983 --> 22:16.032
Hey! Rainer.

22:16.033 --> 22:18.732
What changed your mind?
Your screen test get canceled?

22:18.733 --> 22:21.692
Oh, no, I just actually wanted to come

22:21.693 --> 22:25.103
and support you and your cause and..

22:26.153 --> 22:28.692
And somethin' else.

22:28.693 --> 22:31.112
I don't know what it is,
but there's somethin' else.

22:31.113 --> 22:35.692
Yeah, well, I'm leaving early
and I'm not drinking tonight.

22:35.693 --> 22:37.982
Wow. You're fun at a party.

22:37.983 --> 22:39.822
That's what they say.

22:39.823 --> 22:42.982
So how are you doing with all of this?

22:42.983 --> 22:46.032
Good. Enjoying this party sober too.

22:46.033 --> 22:48.813
So we have that in common.

22:50.693 --> 22:52.732
Have fun.

22:52.733 --> 22:53.942
Yeah, you too.

23:02.733 --> 23:03.902
Cheers.

23:03.903 --> 23:06.063
Thank you so much for being here.

23:07.773 --> 23:10.023
Your donation means so much to us.

23:11.773 --> 23:13.273
- Hi.
- Hi.

23:19.863 --> 23:21.982
This is going so well.

23:21.983 --> 23:23.942
But maybe we should
divide and conquer.

23:23.943 --> 23:26.862
Really? This is so much fun
doin' it together.

23:26.863 --> 23:28.732
Mm.

23:28.733 --> 23:30.933
Fine, give me my marching orders.

23:31.823 --> 23:34.862
See that group of hipsters
on the deck?

23:34.863 --> 23:37.902
Trustafarians. They met
at an eco-resort in Ecuador.

23:37.903 --> 23:39.942
They're loaded.

23:39.943 --> 23:42.112
You hit them, I'll hit the
hedge fund wants in the kitchen

23:42.113 --> 23:45.112
and then we'll meet back up, okay?

23:45.113 --> 23:46.893
Okay.

23:49.073 --> 23:51.732
Of all the blowout rages
you've ever thrown at this place

23:51.733 --> 23:53.652
this is definitely not one of them.

23:53.653 --> 23:56.032
Sorry to disappoint.

23:56.033 --> 24:00.032
It's okay. You can always
make it up to me later.

24:00.033 --> 24:02.772
Pretty sure you met
my girlfriend, Harper, right?

24:02.773 --> 24:04.973
And that's ever stopped you.

24:06.033 --> 24:07.902
This one's serious.

24:07.903 --> 24:10.902
Wow! Serious.

24:10.903 --> 24:13.072
Serious isn't only the word
that comes to mind

24:13.073 --> 24:15.612
when I think of Harper Tate.

24:15.613 --> 24:17.692
Well, you don't know
anything about her.

24:17.693 --> 24:20.772
I do. My dad produced six
seasons of "My Secret Diary"

24:20.773 --> 24:23.652
and I swear I don't think
I ever met the same girl twice.

24:23.653 --> 24:27.112
One day she was Ms. Kabbalah
and the next, a dubstep DJ.

24:27.113 --> 24:30.692
Mm, that was a long time ago.
She's changed a lot since then.

24:30.693 --> 24:32.152
And she'll keep changing.
It's just who she is.

24:32.153 --> 24:35.692
So why don't you enjoy
the whole eco-warrior thing

24:35.693 --> 24:37.822
while it lasts?

24:37.823 --> 24:40.233
Is this because
I never visited you at Yale?

24:41.943 --> 24:43.982
Harper's a chameleon

24:43.983 --> 24:47.063
which makes you two
perfect for each other.

24:54.033 --> 24:57.032
Let's get to know Rainer Devon
a little bit, yeah?

24:57.033 --> 25:00.612
Alright, let's see what do we have?

25:00.613 --> 25:03.822
Some, uh, lame versions
of Paige and Harper.

25:03.823 --> 25:05.692
Less cute version.

25:05.693 --> 25:07.072
Boring.

25:07.073 --> 25:08.902
Hey, guys, I'm Rainer Devon.

25:08.903 --> 25:10.942
- Want a hit, man?
- Ahem. No, thanks, man.

25:10.943 --> 25:13.853
- 'Yo, Rainer, what's up?'
- 'Oh, hey, Rainer.'

25:14.773 --> 25:17.652
Um, ooh, yuck.

25:17.653 --> 25:19.032
These are awful.

25:19.033 --> 25:21.112
"Locked" script
with way too many notes.

25:21.113 --> 25:22.982
Try hard much?

25:22.983 --> 25:25.032
Ooh. Ah!

25:25.033 --> 25:28.982
Rainer Devon, what do we have here?

25:28.983 --> 25:31.072
Naughty boy.

25:31.073 --> 25:33.032
♪ Tonight ♪

25:33.033 --> 25:36.942
♪ Party people we know what you like ♪

25:36.943 --> 25:41.032
♪ We can make it electric tonight.. ♪

25:41.033 --> 25:42.772
So any luck?

25:42.773 --> 25:45.032
No, this is like a junior high dance.

25:45.033 --> 25:46.692
Can't seem to break through here.

25:46.693 --> 25:47.902
Honestly, I don't even know
where to start.

25:47.903 --> 25:49.772
It'll be okay. Where's Billy?

25:49.773 --> 25:52.732
Uh, mingling somewhere.

25:52.733 --> 25:55.072
Two bourbons neat and a club soda.

25:55.073 --> 25:57.112
And I found the guy
that we've been looking for.

25:57.113 --> 25:58.942
- Really? Who is it?
- Derek Bagotti.

25:58.943 --> 26:00.982
Alexis says everybody calls him D-bag.

26:00.983 --> 26:04.032
Oh, please, tell me this isn't
a recommendation from Alexis.

26:04.033 --> 26:07.652
- No, but yes.
- Forget it. Forget it.

26:07.653 --> 26:09.732
No, not so fast.
He's legit. I looked him up.

26:09.733 --> 26:12.072
He produced not one but two
Sundance entries last year.

26:12.073 --> 26:15.822
- Both finishing fun jobs.
- Okay.

26:15.823 --> 26:18.072
And he said he really wants
to hear our pitch.

26:18.073 --> 26:20.063
So come on, let's go.

26:22.693 --> 26:24.772
Fancy crowd.

26:24.773 --> 26:26.032
Do I look okay?

26:26.033 --> 26:28.862
You look perfect
for this or any other crowd.

26:28.863 --> 26:30.862
Thank you.

26:30.863 --> 26:33.032
Well, this is swanky.

26:33.033 --> 26:34.902
When we have a fundraiser
at city block kids

26:34.903 --> 26:37.112
it's pizza and a car wash.

26:37.113 --> 26:38.973
You look gorgeous.

26:40.073 --> 26:41.893
Thank you.

26:43.943 --> 26:46.772
- Do you see him?
- No.

26:46.773 --> 26:48.772
'There's a lotta booze here.'

26:48.773 --> 26:50.273
It's gotta be tough for him.

26:51.863 --> 26:52.942
Great.

26:52.943 --> 26:55.942
Jordan, can I, please,
talk to you for a second?

26:55.943 --> 26:58.822
Look, I'm sorry, okay?
It was gonna come out, anyway.

26:58.823 --> 27:00.973
I was just tellin' the truth.

27:06.863 --> 27:09.103
What the hell is Jordan Wilder
doing here?

27:14.943 --> 27:17.143
What are you tryin' to do to me?

27:24.482 --> 27:27.422
Seriously? Get out.

27:31.312 --> 27:34.101
Look, Jordan's here
because I invited him.

27:34.102 --> 27:37.221
Why? With all I'm dealing with,
why would you do that?

27:37.222 --> 27:39.431
Because donors love movie stars, okay?

27:39.432 --> 27:41.101
And, like it or not, he's a celebrity.

27:41.102 --> 27:42.481
He's all over the tabloids.

27:42.482 --> 27:45.311
- Yeah, for screwing my mom.
- Rainer...

27:45.312 --> 27:47.221
You know what, I'm startin'
to see a pattern here.

27:47.222 --> 27:49.391
You just do
whatever the hell you want.

27:49.392 --> 27:50.521
You don't check in with me.

27:50.522 --> 27:52.351
You don't seem to care
about my feelings

27:52.352 --> 27:53.481
or at this point, the triggers

27:53.482 --> 27:55.141
that landed me in rehab
in the first place.

27:55.142 --> 27:57.481
That's not true, okay? I'm, I'm sorry.

27:57.482 --> 27:59.682
I-I'll-I'll make him leave.

28:01.312 --> 28:03.561
Whoo. Looks like mommy and daddy
are fighting.

28:03.562 --> 28:06.101
If I had to guess,
I'd say Rainer didn't know

28:06.102 --> 28:08.431
his former BFF, Jordan, was coming.

28:08.432 --> 28:10.391
Sloaney, are you watching this
right now?

28:10.392 --> 28:13.481
- Hm?
- Uh, who are you texting?

28:13.482 --> 28:16.391
Um, Tangey.

28:16.392 --> 28:18.561
Oh. Is she coming?

28:18.562 --> 28:21.592
Uh, well, she found out
you're here, so no.

28:22.522 --> 28:25.221
Oh.

28:25.222 --> 28:27.481
So much for my apology to her.

28:27.482 --> 28:30.221
'So I roll up for this club
with, like, seven girls, right?'

28:30.222 --> 28:32.141
They're the hottest in the club
and the bouncer goes

28:32.142 --> 28:34.141
"You're not on the list."
So you know what I say to him?

28:34.142 --> 28:36.141
I said "Hey, pal, guess what.
I wrote the list.

28:36.142 --> 28:37.311
'Cause I just bought
your freakin' club."

28:37.312 --> 28:40.101
Boom! That's a true story.

28:40.102 --> 28:41.271
So our film, it's a roadhouse...

28:41.272 --> 28:43.141
Anh-anh-anh, not so fast.

28:43.142 --> 28:45.311
Come on. How about we all
get acquainted first, yeah?

28:45.312 --> 28:49.221
See, this is my special reserve
of my family's tequila.

28:49.222 --> 28:51.311
Well, my family didn't make it,
a bunch of Mexicans did

28:51.312 --> 28:54.101
but it's our label.

28:54.102 --> 28:56.431
So we get rich.

28:56.432 --> 28:58.481
- Thank you.
- Oh, uh, no, no.

28:58.482 --> 29:01.141
Actually, I'm okay.
I'm not drinking tonight.

29:01.142 --> 29:02.481
What, you hear this?

29:02.482 --> 29:04.481
Chica, come on!

29:04.482 --> 29:07.101
Look, this stuff is so pure,
you can drink a gallon of it

29:07.102 --> 29:08.391
'and not have a headache tomorrow.'

29:08.392 --> 29:11.141
No, no, I, I really
have to get up early.

29:11.142 --> 29:15.101
In fact, it's-it's medicinal.

29:15.102 --> 29:17.101
'I insist. Come on.'

29:17.102 --> 29:18.481
Well, it's called pounder's privilege.

29:18.482 --> 29:20.311
You pound a shot,
you get the privilege of me

29:20.312 --> 29:22.351
listening to your pitch.

29:22.352 --> 29:24.521
'It's a party. Come on!'

29:24.522 --> 29:27.271
You're too young to act this old.

29:27.272 --> 29:29.311
Okay.

29:29.312 --> 29:31.181
- One shot though.
- Yeah.

29:31.182 --> 29:33.181
One shot. I'm a lightweight.

29:33.182 --> 29:35.561
Oh, good. To my new friends.

29:35.562 --> 29:37.521
- Here, here!
- Cheers.

29:37.522 --> 29:39.262
'Okay.'

29:41.392 --> 29:44.431
'Oh, yeah, that is
like little baby kisses'

29:44.432 --> 29:46.271
'just goin' down, you know?'

29:46.272 --> 29:48.431
See, see, that's why
we call our label Dos Besitos.

29:48.432 --> 29:51.521
Yeah, so it means little kisses
in Espanol. Mm-hmm.

29:51.522 --> 29:53.061
It's, uh, excellent, right, Paige?

29:53.062 --> 29:55.271
- Yeah, it's so good.
- 'I know.'

29:55.272 --> 29:57.181
Blows Clooney's away, am I right?

29:57.182 --> 29:58.431
- Yeah.
- Screw that guy.

29:58.432 --> 30:00.481
Hey, come on, so tell me.
What's your movie about?

30:00.482 --> 30:03.302
- Uh, you wanna see the trailer?
- Nah.

30:04.272 --> 30:07.391
I'm kidding.
Come on, dazzle me. Bring it on.

30:07.392 --> 30:10.311
Do you see,
uh, do you see that? Yeah.

30:10.312 --> 30:13.101
Actually, here, Paige, can we switch?

30:13.102 --> 30:16.481
It's like a, it's a little
roadhouse noir.

30:16.482 --> 30:19.521
Yeah, it's kind of like, uh,
early Tarantino and Rodriguez.

30:19.522 --> 30:21.061
But with some much more heart.

30:21.062 --> 30:22.221
Jake is an amazing writer
and director.

30:22.222 --> 30:24.271
He, he even shot it himself.

30:24.272 --> 30:26.311
Yeah, and Billy's performance
is so moving and real.

30:26.312 --> 30:29.221
Oh, I'm sure it is. Well, looks great.

30:29.222 --> 30:31.561
Alright, how about some
Dos Besitos round dos, huh?

30:31.562 --> 30:35.481
Here, come on.
It's like little baby kisses.

30:35.482 --> 30:37.561
- The young Tarantino, right?
- 'Yeah.'

30:37.562 --> 30:39.311
- Yeah.
- 'Jake.'

30:39.312 --> 30:42.552
Hey! Hey, hey.
Come on, it's good. Right?

30:43.392 --> 30:46.351
Yes!

30:46.352 --> 30:48.302
'Oh, yeah, I love it.'

30:49.222 --> 30:52.221
Four, five, boom.

30:52.222 --> 30:54.221
'Oh, yes.'

30:54.222 --> 30:56.592
- Rainer, is everything okay?
- I swear to God, Alexis.

31:01.062 --> 31:04.311
Excuse me. Everyone,
can I have your attention?

31:04.312 --> 31:07.561
Can I have
everyone's attention, please?

31:07.562 --> 31:09.271
We just wanted to welcome you all

31:09.272 --> 31:11.391
and thank you so much
for being here tonight.

31:11.392 --> 31:13.481
Thank you, everybody.
We are so excited

31:13.482 --> 31:16.141
to be taking Trending Ocean
to the next level.

31:16.142 --> 31:20.342
And without further ado,
please enjoy our newest PSA.

31:24.142 --> 31:26.221
Did you know
there's a garbage island

31:26.222 --> 31:29.382
twice the size of Texas
floating in the Pacific?

31:30.272 --> 31:35.521
Hi. I'm Rainer Devon, actor,
surfer, ocean lover.

31:35.522 --> 31:37.391
'After a long, hard day on the set'

31:37.392 --> 31:41.311
'nothing replenishes my soul
like time in the water.'

31:41.312 --> 31:44.561
'Scientists estimate that
up to 80% of all life on Earth'

31:44.562 --> 31:46.561
'exists beneath the ocean surface.'

31:46.562 --> 31:50.101
'Each year 100,000 dolphins..'

32:10.182 --> 32:11.561
You thought you'd just
casually walk up here, huh?

32:11.562 --> 32:13.101
- It's cool. I'm...
- No.

32:13.102 --> 32:14.481
There's nothing cool
about any of this.

32:14.482 --> 32:16.561
Did you talk to a reporter about me?

32:16.562 --> 32:18.422
What?

32:19.352 --> 32:21.221
It was you, wasn't it?

32:21.222 --> 32:22.391
Do you hate me that much?

32:22.392 --> 32:24.141
What are you talking about, Jordan?

32:24.142 --> 32:26.311
A reporter ambushed me at the hotel.

32:26.312 --> 32:28.561
Knew my real name,
knew I was from Chicago.

32:28.562 --> 32:31.141
I'm not gonna get nominated
for a Oscar now

32:31.142 --> 32:33.592
and if news gets out about
what I did, I can go to jail.

32:35.482 --> 32:39.221
How, how could you think that
about me? How could you..

32:39.222 --> 32:42.271
Even after all we've been
through, I would never.

32:42.272 --> 32:44.271
But you, you have no problem

32:44.272 --> 32:46.481
sticking the knife in over and over.

32:46.482 --> 32:51.302
And you know what, sleeping with
my mom wasn't the worst part.

32:52.392 --> 32:55.431
It was that you pretended
to be my friend all these years.

32:55.432 --> 32:58.391
And you never told me the truth.

32:58.392 --> 33:01.311
Every day we lived together was a lie.

33:01.312 --> 33:03.561
- I'm leaving.
- No. I'm leaving.

33:03.562 --> 33:05.682
- Wait.
- Don't. Just don't.

33:14.312 --> 33:15.682
Paige.

33:16.482 --> 33:18.311
Rainer.

33:18.312 --> 33:21.262
Hi. Great party.

33:22.142 --> 33:23.311
You okay?

33:23.312 --> 33:25.311
Me? Oh, never better.

33:25.312 --> 33:28.221
Just waitin' on my ride.

33:28.222 --> 33:30.592
Ooh, great catch.

33:31.522 --> 33:35.302
Looks like your ride came
and went 15 minutes ago.

33:37.272 --> 33:39.632
Oh. I can get a really
bad rating for that.

33:40.562 --> 33:43.311
Come on, I'll take ya home.

33:43.312 --> 33:45.382
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

33:50.482 --> 33:52.592
Did you get that?

34:06.222 --> 34:07.592
You okay?

34:13.522 --> 34:15.422
Jordan.

34:16.482 --> 34:18.561
It doesn't take me long
when I work with a new kid

34:18.562 --> 34:21.382
to know when they've come
from an abusive background.

34:22.562 --> 34:26.221
I know that whatever
your private life is

34:26.222 --> 34:28.422
it has a lot of pain attached to it.

34:31.101 --> 34:35.302
I just, I want you to know that
when you're ready to share..

34:38.431 --> 34:40.512
...I'm here for you.

34:52.562 --> 34:55.521
♪ I know ♪

34:55.522 --> 34:57.722
♪ All my flaws.. ♪

34:59.062 --> 35:01.351
Mm.

35:01.352 --> 35:05.561
Well, this party's cashed, huh?

35:05.562 --> 35:08.481
Hey, what do you say we move on?

35:08.482 --> 35:11.221
Oh, Jake is coming back with limes.

35:11.222 --> 35:14.756
Oh, sweetheart. Jake is a lime, yeah.

35:14.757 --> 35:16.546
Hey, come on,
let's go to Bootsy Bellows.

35:16.547 --> 35:18.596
I got a buddy who can get us right in.

35:18.597 --> 35:20.676
Uh, actually, you know what?

35:20.677 --> 35:22.636
What about Barge 1200?

35:22.637 --> 35:24.716
Isn't that at a hotel?

35:24.717 --> 35:26.506
Well, it's intimate

35:26.507 --> 35:28.846
but we can, we can keep talking
business if you want.

35:28.847 --> 35:32.426
But you know, I just need
a little extra convincing

35:32.427 --> 35:34.596
that this is a project
I just wanna climb aboard.

35:34.597 --> 35:37.886
- Whoa, dude, back off!
- What? Come on.

35:37.887 --> 35:39.716
Babe, you've been giving me
signals all night.

35:39.717 --> 35:41.386
- No, I haven't.
- Yes, you have.

35:41.387 --> 35:43.596
Hey, hey, she said back off.

35:47.467 --> 35:49.466
Fine.

35:49.467 --> 35:51.636
I guess I'll see you guys
at Sundance, right?

35:51.637 --> 35:55.386
Or.. Oh, no. Maybe I won't.

35:55.387 --> 35:58.636
'Cause you're not getting
a dime of my money.

35:58.637 --> 35:59.806
Oh.

35:59.807 --> 36:02.466
Nice tie, dork.

36:02.467 --> 36:03.707
Mm.

36:05.597 --> 36:07.047
Thank you.

36:09.847 --> 36:12.007
Let's go find Paige, yeah?

36:14.717 --> 36:17.426
Damn it, Alexis.

36:17.427 --> 36:19.676
And thanks for screwing me again.

36:19.677 --> 36:23.466
I mean, you try to help someone.
Crazy.

36:23.467 --> 36:25.636
Alright, come on,
Sloaney-baloney, let's bail.

36:25.637 --> 36:26.886
I didn't even get a chance
to apologize.

36:26.887 --> 36:29.636
This night's been a total bust.

36:29.637 --> 36:33.716
Um, actually, Lex,
I've, I've got somewhere to be.

36:33.717 --> 36:35.636
Ooh, booty call.

36:35.637 --> 36:37.466
Who's it with?

36:37.467 --> 36:40.636
Uh, no. It's actually something else.

36:40.637 --> 36:43.587
Well, what is it? I mean,
I can come with you, right?

36:44.507 --> 36:45.846
Tangey texted

36:45.847 --> 36:47.846
and she's at some music
party in the Hills

36:47.847 --> 36:50.667
and I haven't seen her yet, so..

36:51.717 --> 36:55.747
- So you're ditching me.
- I'll, I'll call you later.

36:59.847 --> 37:01.756
Turn it off.

37:01.757 --> 37:03.957
I said turn it off!

37:07.547 --> 37:09.747
- Sloane.
- Harper.

37:10.547 --> 37:12.596
Thank you so much for coming.

37:12.597 --> 37:15.386
And uh, say hi to your dad for me.

37:15.387 --> 37:16.667
I'll do.

37:17.677 --> 37:19.426
Oh.

37:19.427 --> 37:23.837
I saw Rainer leaving with the,
um, the redhead, Paige Townsen.

37:26.467 --> 37:28.716
I thought you should know.

37:28.717 --> 37:31.587
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

37:38.677 --> 37:40.716
- Hey.
- Hi.

37:40.717 --> 37:42.676
Thanks. Thanks for coming.

37:42.677 --> 37:46.846
It's the only way I wasn't
gonna cross any boundaries.

37:46.847 --> 37:48.756
I'm glad I could help.

37:48.757 --> 37:51.596
Well, you're right about me.

37:51.597 --> 37:54.426
I'm shameless, you know, as a parent.

37:54.427 --> 37:56.636
You know what, strike that,
as a person.

37:56.637 --> 38:00.007
I'm controlling,
dictatorial, manipulative..

38:10.847 --> 38:12.747
You're wonderful..

38:13.757 --> 38:15.627
...and smart..

38:16.637 --> 38:18.877
...and sexy as hell.

38:22.717 --> 38:26.627
Um, could you bring us a bottle
of your best champagne?

38:27.677 --> 38:30.587
- What?
- Well, let's celebrate.

38:37.637 --> 38:38.886
We're walking. Good.

38:38.887 --> 38:41.546
You got some headache meds or..

38:41.547 --> 38:44.716
Um, yeah, on the, the..

38:44.717 --> 38:47.716
...that pots and pans area.

38:47.717 --> 38:49.716
- Ah.
- Cabinet. Got it.

38:49.717 --> 38:51.636
Oh, God.

38:51.637 --> 38:55.466
You know, I feel like
that whole Cinderella thing

38:55.467 --> 38:57.466
patriarchic bull.

38:57.467 --> 38:58.636
You know, I just don't think

38:58.637 --> 39:01.636
she accidentally left her shoes there.

39:01.637 --> 39:05.466
I think she purposely took them
off, and left them there

39:05.467 --> 39:09.886
because they were pointy,
uncomfortable.

39:09.887 --> 39:11.747
Rainer.

39:14.387 --> 39:15.747
You okay?

39:17.717 --> 39:20.466
I just got so nauseous.

39:20.467 --> 39:22.886
Here, take. Now.

39:22.887 --> 39:24.546
Thank you.

39:24.547 --> 39:27.587
There. I got it.

39:36.467 --> 39:38.747
Such an intimate thing.

39:41.467 --> 39:42.747
What?

39:43.717 --> 39:45.747
Touching a foot.
