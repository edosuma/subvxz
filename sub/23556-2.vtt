21:11.206 --> 21:12.275
It's the cops.

21:12.344 --> 21:13.275
[doorbell ringing continues]5-0.

21:13.344 --> 21:14.689
You need to stall them.Now?!

21:14.758 --> 21:16.310
Yes, now, we don't have
time for questions!

21:16.379 --> 21:17.413
Come on, let's go!

21:20.034 --> 21:21.827
Uh, hi!

21:21.896 --> 21:23.000
Hi, Anika.

21:23.068 --> 21:24.482
Everything okay here?

21:24.551 --> 21:25.517
Yup, uh-huh.

21:27.344 --> 21:28.344
Can we come in?

21:28.413 --> 21:30.310
Ah, well, you know,

21:30.379 --> 21:31.965
the reason
I'm so dirty is

21:32.034 --> 21:34.827
we're having,
uh, problems

21:34.896 --> 21:36.551
with, uh...

21:36.620 --> 21:37.551
ceilings.

21:38.931 --> 21:40.000
The ceilings.

21:40.068 --> 21:41.068
Yeah.

21:41.137 --> 21:42.103
Yeah, it's really
dangerous.

21:42.172 --> 21:43.620
They're falling down,

21:43.689 --> 21:44.931
so you should
come back later.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.379
Okay, enough
with this nonsense.

21:46.448 --> 21:47.551
Now let us in,
little girl.

21:50.965 --> 21:52.448
Guys, we've got company!

21:58.137 --> 21:59.379
Oh no.

21:59.448 --> 22:00.586
