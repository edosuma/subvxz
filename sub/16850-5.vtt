00:01.601 --> 00:03.637
(male narrator)
Previously on
Childrens Hospital.

00:03.703 --> 00:05.173
And then, we'll insert this tiny
camera into your son's urethra

00:05.239 --> 00:07.208
and take pictures
of his urinary tract.

00:07.275 --> 00:09.210
- What happened?
- I lost another one.

00:09.277 --> 00:11.212
Oof. Never gets
any easier, does it?

00:11.279 --> 00:13.214
- We're not Gods.
- No.

00:13.281 --> 00:16.750
- We're just men and women.
- Ah, yeah.

00:18.052 --> 00:21.189
[theme music]

00:22.556 --> 00:24.492
(female on loudspeaker)
'Attention, staff.'

00:24.558 --> 00:26.494
'I had that awful
nightmare again.'

00:26.560 --> 00:29.497
Alright, people. Looks like
a building collapsed downtown.

00:29.563 --> 00:31.932
And two critically injured
patients have been rerouted here

00:31.999 --> 00:33.201
for emergency treatment.

00:33.267 --> 00:35.203
I'm putting my best doctors
on it.

00:35.269 --> 00:37.105
Dr. Maestro, Dr. Richie.

00:37.171 --> 00:39.773
- Dr. Flame, Dr. Fantastic.
- Hey, hey, hey.

00:39.840 --> 00:42.610
'Dr. Downs...and that's it.'

00:42.676 --> 00:44.412
[clearing the throat]

00:44.478 --> 00:47.848
Mm. Looks like somebody forgot
their cough drop, Dr. Spratt.

00:47.915 --> 00:49.883
- Oh.
- Ha-ha-ha.

00:49.950 --> 00:51.452
God!

00:51.519 --> 00:54.822
Let's show them what
Childrens Hospital is all about.

00:54.888 --> 00:56.157
Come on.

00:58.192 --> 01:01.829
- Okay. You're a great surgeon.
- Well.

01:01.895 --> 01:03.264
(Chief)
'Mm.'

01:03.331 --> 01:05.299
This is why you went
to medical school.

01:05.366 --> 01:09.170
- Yes.
- Why is this part happening?

01:09.237 --> 01:13.341
Your pupil dilation suggests
high Bortiaphine levels.

01:13.407 --> 01:15.643
Lieutenant,
am I gonna make it?

01:15.709 --> 01:18.246
I fear the Borg may have
contaminated your bloodstream

01:18.312 --> 01:19.480
with nanoprobes.

01:19.547 --> 01:21.682
- Wow.
- Good day, doctor.

01:21.749 --> 01:23.484
I am Lt. D'Ghor Koru.

01:23.551 --> 01:25.753
Medical officer on
the Starship Nivoa.

01:25.819 --> 01:27.755
While attending
a Starfleet event nearby --

01:27.821 --> 01:30.291
Um, you mean the Nerdcon
at the convention center

01:30.358 --> 01:32.293
next door?
Ha-ha, okay.

01:32.360 --> 01:34.428
Listen, dildo,
your friend is sick.

01:34.495 --> 01:36.464
You've never touched
a tit in your life.

01:36.530 --> 01:39.533
And he needs a doctor, a real
doctor, one who's been laid.

01:39.600 --> 01:42.670
Now, I would do it,
but...come on, look at me.

01:43.837 --> 01:45.105
Look at you.

01:47.808 --> 01:49.210
These are tits.

01:50.311 --> 01:52.280
Do you think she
meant she would do

01:52.346 --> 01:54.482
like do us or-or
do the procedure?

01:54.548 --> 01:55.849
Procedure.

01:55.916 --> 01:58.886
Dori, find another doctor to
treat the dork in Room 7.

01:58.952 --> 02:00.288
Not gonna happen.

02:01.622 --> 02:03.991
Please help me. There's
something wrong with my son.

02:04.057 --> 02:06.227
- And what is your name, sir?
- Jeffrey Ross.

02:06.294 --> 02:08.529
Jeffrey Ross.
And occupation?

02:08.596 --> 02:12.533
Insult comic and
Roastmaster General.

02:12.600 --> 02:14.935
- I'll take it from here, sir.
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

02:15.002 --> 02:17.571
We need a nurse,
not Florence Nightingwhale.

02:17.638 --> 02:20.374
[laughter]

02:20.441 --> 02:23.544
You know what? You could
play a house on House.

02:23.611 --> 02:25.513
[laughter]

02:25.579 --> 02:28.148
Oh, this is fun.
I never roasted a pig before.

02:28.216 --> 02:30.117
[laughter]

02:30.184 --> 02:34.322
- Somebody, please help my son.
- Thank you.

02:34.388 --> 02:36.357
They were rushed here
from the building collapse.

02:36.424 --> 02:38.359
This flagpole fell
and pierced them both

02:38.426 --> 02:40.160
without hitting
any major organs.

02:40.228 --> 02:43.197
I don't wanna be stuck next
to this useless old dude.

02:43.264 --> 02:46.200
I pity you, son.
My name is Hubert McGraw.

02:46.267 --> 02:48.769
I'm 67 years old.

02:48.836 --> 02:51.805
I've lived a good life,
and I want you to know

02:51.872 --> 02:53.807
I made peace with my God.

02:53.874 --> 02:55.576
'You guys better save me'

02:55.643 --> 02:58.212
or my dad's gonna sue
the crap outta this place.

02:58.279 --> 03:00.180
Can someone please
help me with my son?

03:00.248 --> 03:02.350
Haven't seen this
many guys on one pole

03:02.416 --> 03:05.085
since I went to that party
at Andy Dick's house.

03:05.152 --> 03:06.320
[laughter]

03:06.387 --> 03:08.422
Somebody, please help my son.

03:08.489 --> 03:10.791
Oh, my God.
That's insult comic Jeff Ross.

03:10.858 --> 03:13.861
I'm a huge fan of his.
Hey, you guys got this, right?

03:13.927 --> 03:16.464
You just wanna treat
Jeffrey Ross' son, don't you?

03:16.530 --> 03:19.166
No, no, no. I wanna not treat
Jeffrey Ross' kid

03:19.233 --> 03:21.034
so he has to stay here longer.

03:21.101 --> 03:23.804
We'd enjoy his brand of
ball-busting long as we want.

03:23.871 --> 03:26.840
Great idea. With any luck,
that kid'll slip into a coma.

03:26.907 --> 03:28.609
[laughing]

03:28.676 --> 03:31.979
Much like I do whenever I watch
a roast Jeffrey doesn't host.

03:32.045 --> 03:33.347
[laughing]

03:36.617 --> 03:39.753
- Okay, cool.
- Dr. Spratt, you have to help.

03:39.820 --> 03:41.989
No other doctor wants
to treat the nerd.

03:42.055 --> 03:43.691
You've to see
what's going on.

03:43.757 --> 03:45.659
Ugh!

03:45.726 --> 03:49.730
Much like I-much like I..
A roast that he doesn't host.

03:49.797 --> 03:50.931
[laughter]

03:50.998 --> 03:52.800
Oh. Oh, ah.

03:52.866 --> 03:54.835
[screaming]

03:54.902 --> 03:56.169
What...is going on?

03:56.236 --> 03:58.105
'God, I hate you two.'

03:58.171 --> 03:59.773
What means this word "hate?"

03:59.840 --> 04:02.943
Where the hell is the bionic arm
I asked you for?

04:03.010 --> 04:04.945
It doesn't exist, you idiot.

04:05.012 --> 04:06.514
- Call security.
- Yeah, okay.

04:06.580 --> 04:09.583
Here, hold this incision open
while I insert the transinducer.

04:09.650 --> 04:12.986
- What? No, no.
- Agh!

04:16.123 --> 04:19.059
Wait, what's happening?

04:19.125 --> 04:20.761
I feel-I feel strong.

04:20.827 --> 04:22.763
I implanted
a transinducer, Captain.

04:22.830 --> 04:25.065
It's fighting
the Borg's techno-virus.

04:25.132 --> 04:26.567
(Captain)
'Thank you, Lieutenant.'

04:26.634 --> 04:29.403
Starfleet Command will be made
aware of what you did today.

04:29.470 --> 04:32.039
Why are you still
talking like this?

04:32.105 --> 04:33.173
Like what?

04:33.240 --> 04:35.175
We are merely
talking to each other

04:35.242 --> 04:37.044
with the honor,
respect, and admiration

04:37.110 --> 04:39.747
that we've earned through years
of serving together.

04:43.417 --> 04:44.852
That was beautiful.

04:46.053 --> 04:47.321
[instrumental music]

04:52.259 --> 04:53.461
(Captain)
'Oh, no way.'

04:54.728 --> 04:57.598
- No way. This is awesome.
- Mm.

04:57.665 --> 05:01.402
Thank you so much.
Just ease this off.

05:01.469 --> 05:03.437
Yeah, he had a fever,
an upset stomach

05:03.504 --> 05:05.339
and then he
just passed out.

05:05.406 --> 05:07.375
Listen, I just have
got to tell you

05:07.441 --> 05:10.778
how excited we all
are to have you here.

05:10.844 --> 05:13.847
- It's exciting. You're the king
- I mean, you are the king.

05:13.914 --> 05:15.883
- What happened to you?
- What do you mean?

05:15.949 --> 05:18.318
The last chick I saw
walking like you was

05:18.386 --> 05:22.423
Pam Anderson after
she banged Tommy Lee.

05:22.490 --> 05:25.058
I have a degenerative
nerve disorder

05:25.125 --> 05:27.928
that's slowly crippling me
starting with my legs.

05:27.995 --> 05:30.398
- Can you help my son?
- Do me now. Do me.

05:30.464 --> 05:33.233
- How am I worthy of insults?
- Chief. We need you, guys.

05:33.300 --> 05:36.203
We have a situation here.
What started out as a routine

05:36.269 --> 05:38.806
multiple pole impaling has
become a socio-racial minefield.

05:38.872 --> 05:41.642
- We can only save one man.
- This is the PR nightmare.

05:41.709 --> 05:44.277
If we save the white kid,
the press labels us racist.

05:44.344 --> 05:48.215
If we save the musician, we'll
lose the young boy in his prime.

05:48.281 --> 05:52.620
Either way we're in danger of
inciting a real race war here.

05:52.686 --> 05:54.655
My instinct is to
let them both die.

05:54.722 --> 05:56.857
- Let me kill them.
- Yeah, do it.

05:56.924 --> 05:58.826
Wait. No, no, no.

05:58.892 --> 06:01.094
What if someone finds out
we let them die?

06:01.161 --> 06:05.533
We're doctors, and damn it, we
took an oath to first do no harm

06:05.599 --> 06:10.003
that's what I intend to do
in there. No first harm.

06:10.070 --> 06:11.405
Who's with me?

06:12.673 --> 06:15.008
[clicking tongue]
Wet.

06:15.075 --> 06:16.777
'What's the story?
Is it working?'

06:16.844 --> 06:19.780
- Their heart rates are falling.
- We gave it a good shot

06:19.847 --> 06:21.815
but one of these guys
is gonna die.

06:21.882 --> 06:25.318
I'm happy and content to give my
life in order to save another.

06:25.385 --> 06:28.121
Besides, I have terminal cancer.

06:28.188 --> 06:32.526
It'll mean I'll be able to
reunite with my dear Louise.

06:32.593 --> 06:34.962
Okay. I guess it's clear
what we need to do.

06:35.028 --> 06:37.164
- Thank you, doctor.
- Sorry, white kid.

06:37.230 --> 06:39.299
He just said you should save me.

06:39.366 --> 06:41.535
The choice is tomorrow's
headlines reading

06:41.602 --> 06:43.336
"Beloved grandfather, war hero
and black American

06:43.403 --> 06:46.373
lives through a tragedy." Or,
"Doctors save a hate-spewing

06:46.440 --> 06:48.776
crappy music loving
date rapist".

06:48.842 --> 06:50.778
- We choose the latter.
- No.

06:50.844 --> 06:52.780
- The former.
- What did I say?

06:52.846 --> 06:55.716
- You said latter.
- Let's do this.

06:55.783 --> 06:58.986
- Do your worst, sir.
- Okay. Uh, hold on. Okay.

06:59.052 --> 07:01.955
Okay, you're so handicapped that
you need your own parking space

07:02.022 --> 07:04.758
- preferably one near the door.
- My God! Ha ha ha!

07:04.825 --> 07:06.760
I haven't heard
this many bad jokes

07:06.827 --> 07:10.163
since Seinfeld
first tried airplane food.

07:10.230 --> 07:12.099
'Can you please help my son?'

07:12.165 --> 07:14.301
Chief, Dr. Downs,
you're needed in the OR.

07:14.367 --> 07:16.537
Listen, Jeff, why don't you
come with us? Huh?

07:16.604 --> 07:19.807
It'd be an honor to watch you
employ the power of laughter.

07:19.873 --> 07:21.842
- We'll treat your son.
- I'll be right back.

07:21.909 --> 07:24.277
- All right, we got him.
- Yeah, we got him.

07:24.344 --> 07:25.913
- Let's go.
- Hang in there.

07:31.485 --> 07:33.754
- My Chooq is still hard.
- Yeah.

07:33.821 --> 07:36.924
It wants to dock with
your Tag'nor again.

07:36.990 --> 07:38.391
Dock it.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.060
Dr. Spratt.
You're needed in the OR.

07:40.127 --> 07:42.896
Needed? What means
this word, needed?

07:42.963 --> 07:44.097
Come on.

07:47.968 --> 07:50.538
Ensign Spratt,
set phasers for stun.

07:50.604 --> 07:55.208
- I don't know how to do that.
- Doctors, kindly step away.

07:55.275 --> 07:56.644
Lola, what are you doing?

07:56.710 --> 07:59.847
What I should've been doing,
getting a boyfriend.

07:59.913 --> 08:02.883
- And saving these men's lives.
- Yes, and that.

08:02.950 --> 08:05.252
We can't save the both of them.

08:05.318 --> 08:07.087
I have taken a sworn oath

08:07.154 --> 08:10.057
to save every life
I come in contact with.

08:10.123 --> 08:11.792
Now step aside.

08:13.093 --> 08:14.227
[beeping]

08:14.294 --> 08:16.096
Whoa, get a load of these guys.

08:16.163 --> 08:19.867
You look like so-and-so,
and so-and-so had a baby.

08:19.933 --> 08:22.703
Hey that's...
What was it, laundry day?

08:22.770 --> 08:25.539
I don't know. I...
Something's wrong with me.

08:25.606 --> 08:28.576
Too many insults
in my head at once.

08:28.642 --> 08:32.511
Hey, have you ever noticed..
What was it?

08:32.580 --> 08:34.715
Uh... Bea Arthur's dick.

08:34.782 --> 08:36.717
I'm shutting down.

08:36.784 --> 08:38.952
- 'No, Jeff.'
- 'I'll be here all week.'

08:39.019 --> 08:41.520
- Jeff.
- That's my time, folks.

08:41.589 --> 08:44.191
Joke overload.
We lost Jeffrey Ross.

08:44.256 --> 08:47.260
- Now these two are dead.
- This is our last hope.

08:47.327 --> 08:49.863
If I can reverse
the polarity on this phaser

08:49.930 --> 08:51.865
we can get them back.

08:51.932 --> 08:54.467
But if I'm even
a microsecond off

08:54.534 --> 08:59.840
it could tear a hole
in the fabric of space.

08:59.907 --> 09:01.041
Do it.

09:04.344 --> 09:06.880
- He's doing it.
- Uh!

09:07.915 --> 09:11.051
- Come on.
- Agh!

09:12.620 --> 09:16.089
Hey, son of a bitch, he did it!

09:18.425 --> 09:22.529
Aw.

09:22.596 --> 09:24.798
What the hell is going on here?

09:24.865 --> 09:28.268
You trusted these men's
lives to this guy?

09:28.335 --> 09:31.905
This place is full of doctors.
It's criminally irresponsible.

09:37.878 --> 09:41.148
Hey, we just got roasted.

09:41.214 --> 09:44.284
Captain Stern and
Lieutenant Koru ready to beam up

09:44.351 --> 09:45.886
No, don't go.

09:45.953 --> 09:49.389
But the galaxy needs me,
just like you are needed here.

09:49.456 --> 09:51.091
I understand.

09:54.061 --> 09:57.064
- So we're cool?
- Oh, yeah, we're good.

09:59.933 --> 10:01.869
Ready to be beamed up.

10:01.935 --> 10:04.137
- I told them.
- Sorry, nevermind.

10:04.204 --> 10:05.538
[inaudible]

10:05.605 --> 10:08.776
- I'm not trying to be a dick.
- No, no, I get it.

10:15.849 --> 10:17.584
- I'm gonna move my car.
- Yeah, okay.

10:17.651 --> 10:20.420
- I think I parked behind you.
- You parked behind me?
