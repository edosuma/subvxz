Help Help Help

02:42.996 --> 02:46.707
I'm the wanderer, always searching.

02:48.126 --> 02:52.963
You are in me and I give you s.

02:54.758 --> 02:57.427
And we will meet again.

02:58.887 --> 03:01.014
Man can not fool me.

03:04.475 --> 03:06.353
Man can not fool me.

03:10.731 --> 03:12.400
I am walkers.

03:17.155 --> 03:19.407
And you're mine forever.

04:37.776 --> 04:39.820
see these mountains so creepy.

04:41.072 --> 04:43.699
The man said the hills be the back of a snake.

04:44.158 --> 04:45.909
She is sleeping on the stomach.

04:46.161 --> 04:49.079
After the rain, you can see the reflection of their scales.

04:49.372 --> 04:51.081
And so arise rainbow.

04:51.499 --> 04:54.044
And among the snake lifts his head sometimes;

04:54.168 --> 04:55.919
If you look closely, you can see.

04:56.086 --> 04:58.380
Stop, however, the child instilling such fear.

04:58.464 --> 05:01.091
I'm not afraid. Snakes are not bad.

05:01.634 --> 05:03.927
Many cultures see it as a lucky charm.

05:04.220 --> 05:05.889
What culture is?

05:06.055 --> 05:07.556
Some countries in Africa.

05:08.432 --> 05:10.894
Snakes are to accompany the afterlife souls.

05:10.976 --> 05:12.311
Where do they come?

05:12.937 --> 05:14.646
That's what I read in the book nem.

05:15.148 --> 05:16.316
smart girl

05:54.396 --> 05:56.564
You are close.

07:09.303 --> 07:10.763
Well, here we are.

07:15.392 --> 07:19.688
Check it out. A long time it is.

07:20.023 --> 07:21.900
It's pretty dark.

08:45.899 --> 08:47.067
¿William?

08:50.697 --> 08:51.865
¡William!

09:05.003 --> 09:07.297
Can I keep the candles? Please!

10:07.649 --> 10:10.235
Mary sucks. - Mary!

10:11.360 --> 10:12.361
Mary!

10:19.702 --> 10:21.120
The candles went out.

10:22.205 --> 10:25.417
Why are you just went that way? You scared me!

10:25.625 --> 10:29.044
Ok let's go. Returning to the car and wait, where it is safe.

10:29.629 --> 10:32.632
You do us a room ready? Yes.

11:07.792 --> 11:10.836
You're back.

11:13.590 --> 11:16.593
That is also my grandfather's farm, I always say.

11:16.967 --> 11:17.926
And, it was to say?

11:18.302 --> 11:21.221
Class I FIND. How does it feel to living here?

11:22.765 --> 11:24.808
As in any other farm.

11:25.559 --> 11:29.146
My father was always early for work before dawn.

11:30.105 --> 11:32.775
Sometimes I did not see him again before the setting sun.

11:33.442 --> 11:35.110
Do you have friends here?

11:35.278 --> 11:38.114
Yes, sometimes the village boys to play approached.

11:38.572 --> 11:40.240
The village is very close.

11:40.575 --> 11:42.576
Some of the parents worked here.

11:44.913 --> 11:46.831
He was not above all at a child

11:46.956 --> 11:50.585
I think his name was Siya or something like that.

11:51.543 --> 11:53.379
His father was a kind of healer.

11:53.462 --> 11:55.089
A Sangoma?

11:55.423 --> 11:56.841
How do you know that?

11:57.341 --> 11:58.342
From school

12:00.595 --> 12:03.181
Sangoma may call the ancestors.

12:04.139 --> 12:06.558
They're like ghosts, just use.

12:07.434 --> 12:09.728
Where they can sometimes be angry.

12:10.355 --> 12:12.440
That's just superstition, Mary.

12:12.649 --> 12:15.777
This is not just superstition, Aunt Sarah, that's true.

12:18.113 --> 12:21.991
Enough of ghosts and Sangoma before we get all the nightmares still.

12:22.158 --> 12:24.661
We have a lot tomorrow, so please go to sleep.

12:24.744 --> 12:27.831
I would like to ... - No, no, this is enough time tomorrow.

12:28.206 --> 12:29.206
It's okay.

12:42.386 --> 12:43.929
Look, I found FUE.

12:44.014 --> 12:45.014
What is it?

12:46.224 --> 12:48.977
My father's old boots. They are just a bit.

12:49.309 --> 12:53.022
Well done. Finally you will walk in the footsteps of his father.

12:57.527 --> 12:59.362
Then I'll sometimes look a bit.

12:59.446 --> 13:02.949
Let's see if the generator still can. It's time we have electricity.

13:03.033 --> 13:04.366
I can enter?

13:11.331 --> 13:14.711
Sarah stay here and help. I then show you around, okay?

13:14.793 --> 13:15.794
Promise?

13:18.505 --> 13:19.466
promised

13:31.394 --> 13:32.895
Mary?

13:38.067 --> 13:39.318
Mary!

14:09.099 --> 14:10.392
My mother's room.

14:10.517 --> 14:14.729
Wow. These were all things? It was a treasure.

14:15.647 --> 14:17.941
Tonight I want to sleep here. May l?

14:18.024 --> 14:19.024
Please!

14:19.234 --> 14:21.444
: In addition, the house is amazingly big, you know?

14:21.778 --> 14:23.863
you come here and clear, so alone?

14:25.365 --> 14:28.868
Oh, look at you. Come here. Let me get rid of it.

14:47.678 --> 14:51.890
Pssst. Pssst.

15:46.863 --> 15:49.699
If I just got this stupid thing running.

15:50.033 --> 15:52.701
What do you know about the machine, the counter sir?

15:53.077 --> 15:54.495
I give my best.

15:58.332 --> 15:59.918
What's in the shed?

16:02.836 --> 16:04.380
It will be?

16:05.005 --> 16:06.757
No idea, is closed.

16:52.595 --> 16:55.223
To surprise people is not very nice.

17:12.656 --> 17:14.701
Are you lost, Miss?

17:25.420 --> 17:28.089
Do not do hurt. Please sir.

17:48.108 --> 17:49.860
I feed.

17:52.404 --> 17:53.615
Thank you, señor.

18:03.458 --> 18:04.625
Is dead?

18:06.086 --> 18:10.006
Oh, yes, ma'am, and they have been for quite some time.

18:11.965 --> 18:13.384
Look more closely.

18:14.385 --> 18:18.222
Voler truth in His life.

18:20.474 --> 18:21.892
There, everywhere, you see?

18:23.269 --> 18:27.190
Death is life, and life is death.

18:30.402 --> 18:34.948
These worms come here, they need a body to survive.

18:36.532 --> 18:38.784
They differ little from their caterpillars.

18:39.118 --> 18:43.205
They feed on something, then it is to transform something.

18:43.414 --> 18:45.375
My caterpillars turn into moths.

18:53.674 --> 18:55.217
My name is Lazarus.

18:55.426 --> 18:56.427
I am Maria.

18:56.594 --> 18:59.014
Oh, what a pleasure to meet you, Mary.

18:59.888 --> 19:05.019
: Also, what are you doing here in the middle of this forest, and alone?

19:05.394 --> 19:07.814
I just moved to a nearby farm.

19:08.105 --> 19:10.692
I looked for food for my caterpillars.

19:10.900 --> 19:13.695
You should introduce? - Oh please.

19:15.904 --> 19:17.699
Dies are my tracks.

19:19.325 --> 19:22.120
This is called Tiger because of the stripes on the back.

19:22.327 --> 19:23.495
Oh, hello tiger.

19:23.663 --> 19:26.915
The big grumpy because the lord is because it always looks so grumpy.

19:27.875 --> 19:30.753
Here are Toto, William and Sarah.

19:33.381 --> 19:36.634
And now teeters Calvo weave themselves ...

19:36.759 --> 19:39.887
and turn into moths.

19:40.680 --> 19:44.308
Yes, but I never leave because we are friends for life.

19:46.728 --> 19:50.606
Can you help me back to the farm? I lost my house.

20:27.685 --> 20:28.686
willliam

20:28.769 --> 20:31.397
Hears! Mary, come here.

20:31.647 --> 20:33.023

20:33.441 --> 20:35.360

20:51.166 --> 20:53.252
Yes, but died, Siem WAS?

20:53.294 --> 20:57.298
Well, I found the girl here in the woods.

20:57.382 --> 21:00.009
It was? It does not run so far, it's dangerous.

21:00.093 --> 21:02.178
Sorry, my caterpillars were hungry.

21:02.554 --> 21:05.849
As I said, I worked for his father.

21:06.098 --> 21:11.479

21:31.790 --> 21:34.293
Lady, is tut mir Leid so.

21:34.794 --> 21:37.005
I really did not want to worry them.

21:39.048 --> 21:41.425
I had the pleasure to meet you, Mary.

21:41.509 --> 21:43.260
Mach's gut, Lazarus.

21:54.855 --> 21:57.983
Mary, if you strange new herbringst, is not a real problem.

21:58.067 --> 22:00.319
The nearest police station is miles away.

22:00.403 --> 22:03.198
He brought calm back and look here.

22:03.280 --> 22:04.948
It's just kind man.

22:05.075 --> 22:06.492
It is enough, Mary. Go inside.

22:09.287 --> 22:11.331
Why are you always so hard on her?

22:12.039 --> 22:13.957
And we could help their actual use.

22:33.936 --> 22:35.479
You got it repaired.

22:36.815 --> 22:37.856
Strange

22:48.410 --> 22:50.704
I'll go see what commands briefly. Wait here.

23:01.673 --> 23:04.800
Hears! What's going on?

23:05.343 --> 23:06.469
One, señor ...

23:06.885 --> 23:09.263
Without electricity is not good, sir.

23:10.557 --> 23:14.394
I've noticed some problems and I thought it might help.

23:16.186 --> 23:17.396
What have you done?

23:18.022 --> 23:19.565
The diesel filter, sir ...

23:19.816 --> 23:21.317
it was dirty.

23:22.359 --> 23:26.280
And therefore, no diesel could enter the cylinder, sir.

23:26.614 --> 23:28.199
So I got it cleaned.

23:28.490 --> 23:29.992
That is what I did.

23:30.410 --> 23:32.412
Well, now it works, sir.

23:34.163 --> 23:35.164
Thank you, Lazarus.

23:35.957 --> 23:37.459
You are welcome sir.

23:43.298 --> 23:45.133
Good night to you, sir.

23:46.259 --> 23:50.596
Lazarus! So you've been working for my father?

23:51.972 --> 23:54.642
I let myself sleep in the shed. - What is doing what?

23:55.101 --> 23:57.020
It has repaired the generator, Sarah.

23:57.144 --> 23:59.314
Who can go a person alone in the dark?

23:59.564 --> 24:01.566
There is much to do, I need help.

24:01.691 --> 24:03.692
No, he disappears overnight today.

24:03.777 --> 24:05.153
What is wrong with you, Sarah?

24:05.236 --> 24:06.613
It has become Mary.

24:06.695 --> 24:08.865
He has worked here sometimes and has skill.

24:08.948 --> 24:10.950
Something in him is not trusted.

24:11.034 --> 24:11.910
Please, Sarah!

24:11.992 --> 24:14.162
Mary wants to sleep in her mother's room.

24:14.244 --> 24:16.747
Light breaks. candle ne is the hall stop.

24:16.830 --> 24:19.166
- Do you think they do? - Comes clearly.

24:26.298 --> 24:27.925
Sleep was beautiful, small.

24:28.009 --> 24:29.385
You know where we are.

24:29.469 --> 24:31.513
You can always come to us, okay?

24:32.721 --> 24:35.683
Do not worry. the bathroom Mama I feel safe.

24:38.853 --> 24:41.314
I feel that I shouted, Mary.

24:42.231 --> 24:45.402
My mother always was pierced in me will never talk to strangers.

24:45.484 --> 24:47.861
And when I saw this man ... - Lazarus?

24:47.945 --> 24:48.946
Lazarus

24:49.614 --> 24:51.199
I panicked.

24:57.247 --> 24:58.623
I'll protect you.

27:43.371 --> 27:44.748
You're good?

27:47.000 --> 27:48.999
Sarah?

27:49.336 --> 27:52.422
Is nothing. I Dreamed

27:53.757 --> 27:55.383
All good?

27:56.968 --> 28:00.471
Yeah right. Sleep peacefully.

28:18.448 --> 28:21.785
It is back and it's dangerous ...

28:23.286 --> 28:28.416
The only question is when it will strike.

28:29.500 --> 28:33.922
Obara, with all due respect,

28:34.631 --> 28:39.344
I can not continue.

28:40.428 --> 28:43.431
We sat in a cage like pigs,

28:44.348 --> 28:49.479
and I started to expect the attacks of snakes?

28:51.271 --> 28:54.483
And morning we woke up and the next blow?

28:54.733 --> 28:57.361
I do not understand.

28:57.820 --> 29:01.824
A snake that starts with patience.

29:02.701 --> 29:07.579
You have to anticipate each move.

29:08.707 --> 29:12.168
Understand how they think.

29:13.169 --> 29:16.089
So prepare in front of his attack.

29:17.298 --> 29:20.634
If you move too soon, you lost an eye ...

29:21.051 --> 29:24.430
but it is not a snake, he is a demon.

29:25.682 --> 29:28.559
A demon who eats the souls of our loved ones.

29:29.978 --> 29:31.855
The souls of our mothers and children.

29:36.984 --> 29:43.032
Lazarus is just a man, driven by pain and suffering.

29:43.907 --> 29:48.871
No man should ever suffer so much pain.

30:04.887 --> 30:09.600
In desperation purse seiner has given the devil admission.

30:09.683 --> 30:11.894
And we have to face the consequences.

30:12.144 --> 30:18.026
This has, when it comes to raising the dead ...

30:18.567 --> 30:21.863
So why not try to stop it?

30:30.913 --> 30:35.835
Lazarus.

30:37.503 --> 30:42.759
Lazarus.

30:43.009 --> 30:44.760
Who's there?

30:45.553 --> 30:47.681
Show yourself!

30:48.765 --> 30:50.100
I can not see.

30:51.351 --> 30:57.482
¿Want Lazarus? Tell me you love was ...

30:57.691 --> 31:00.151
Daughter back to me.

31:01.568 --> 31:04.822
I can keep my baby in her arms.

31:21.213 --> 31:23.048
It was too late.

31:23.173 --> 31:25.969
There must be a way, sidewalk.

31:27.345 --> 31:30.807
Lazarus was simply a father who loved his daughter.

32:04.048 --> 32:05.215
Vuyiswa

32:43.587 --> 32:46.799
Mary, did Mr. Grummel?

32:47.675 --> 32:49.760
Yes, he died last night.

32:50.303 --> 32:55.725
Oh. Maria. Mary, that I do tan sorry.

32:57.309 --> 33:00.688
I want to bury him. But he's just a caterpillar.

33:01.522 --> 33:02.940
I just throw them away.

33:03.023 --> 33:04.692
No, Mary.

33:05.818 --> 33:10.990
You know, this little caterpillar, then small and insignificant,

33:11.865 --> 33:14.493
Hat a soul, just like you.

33:16.413 --> 33:21.084
In his war was, das niemals stirred.

33:22.292 --> 33:25.963
But all remover. My parents died.

33:26.172 --> 33:27.382
I saw her die.

33:27.464 --> 33:31.593
Yes, Mary, but something alive.

33:32.345 --> 33:33.430
And dies Etwas ...

33:34.431 --> 33:39.519
It is hovering around a small moth finally carried away by the wind;

33:40.603 --> 33:41.688
somewhere

33:42.896 --> 33:45.357
Somewhere far away.

33:47.818 --> 33:51.364
Mary, do you want me buried?

33:53.741 --> 33:54.951
s order

34:06.378 --> 34:08.339
Damel.

34:58.014 --> 34:59.766
This has been good.

35:02.268 --> 35:04.396
Sometimes I miss my parents.

35:08.233 --> 35:11.486
Mary, I want to show you something.

35:12.152 --> 35:13.445
Come on

35:17.951 --> 35:19.159
Be careful

35:28.545 --> 35:29.421
Wait here.

35:58.907 --> 35:59.992
Oh.

36:00.159 --> 36:03.579
These two are my favorites.

36:04.289 --> 36:08.251
I found them while flying alone on the roadside.

36:09.293 --> 36:13.380
The sun was setting. And the air was so clear.

36:14.382 --> 36:17.217
I pursued for a long time.

36:21.139 --> 36:22.724
I want you to take them.

36:23.057 --> 36:24.851
Seriously? Can I keep it?

36:25.309 --> 36:26.393
They are yours.

36:28.938 --> 36:29.981
Mary?

36:30.273 --> 36:31.274
I have to go.

36:33.610 --> 36:36.863
Hide them. This is our little secret, okay?

36:43.994 --> 36:45.371
Where have you been?

36:45.746 --> 36:48.707
Nowhere. Urgently I need the bathroom.

37:04.224 --> 37:07.059
Will, William. - ¿What?

37:07.309 --> 37:09.269
There is a man looking at me.

37:12.356 --> 37:13.775
It must be of the people.

37:14.358 --> 37:15.818
Lazarus, where is Maner?

37:15.902 --> 37:16.945
I do not know, sir.

37:17.027 --> 37:21.532
There is a small settlement on the edge of farmland, where at that time people lived.

37:21.615 --> 37:22.701
Probably one of those.

37:22.784 --> 37:25.452
I do not like that escape as soon as they see us.

37:25.661 --> 37:28.497
Maybe you should go to the people and imagine.

37:28.914 --> 37:30.291
I think it's important.

37:30.708 --> 37:32.626
Tomo Lazarus. He Kanan help.

37:58.193 --> 38:00.362
Okay, you wait here. I speak with them.

38:00.739 --> 38:01.780
Ja, sir.

38:11.206 --> 38:12.541
Good Morning.

38:14.793 --> 38:16.003
How are you?

38:16.755 --> 38:17.588
All of them?

38:23.010 --> 38:25.971
Fine thanks. And you?

38:27.639 --> 38:28.849
What's your name?

38:29.309 --> 38:30.643
My name is Obara.

38:31.311 --> 38:32.394
How are you?

38:33.855 --> 38:35.565
Very well thanks.

38:36.358 --> 38:40.362
Mbu looking ... ... and ...

38:40.527 --> 38:42.446
Zanemvula living here?

38:43.572 --> 38:45.657
We played together on the farm.

38:45.742 --> 38:47.243
At the side of my name is William.

38:48.036 --> 38:49.329
They are dead.

38:51.456 --> 38:54.501
You were the one! How did you get here so fast?

38:56.168 --> 38:57.878
Why do you spy farm?

38:57.961 --> 38:59.047
Nerd ...

38:59.797 --> 39:02.341
Seno name is Suno. He is our scouts.

39:02.509 --> 39:04.885
It was just curious about our new neighbors.

39:05.512 --> 39:07.347
You ask a lot of questions.

39:07.931 --> 39:09.516
You're not welcome here.

39:09.599 --> 39:11.559
Outside!

39:11.726 --> 39:13.311
I do not understand ...

39:14.688 --> 39:18.983
I think they should do better, smoother.

39:19.567 --> 39:21.027
It s peace come.

39:23.405 --> 39:26.199
Get in the car, sir. It's safer.

39:26.407 --> 39:27.784
I speak with them.

39:29.284 --> 39:32.788
What makes You Ha doing here? Soft, demon.

39:35.625 --> 39:39.670
Do not you think that what you are, boy, who dares to threaten me?

39:44.592 --> 39:45.635
Outside!

39:49.806 --> 39:54.436
He is warned, better sleep with your eyes open.

39:56.186 --> 39:59.398
Take care of his affairs with the white man.

39:59.983 --> 40:03.445
We will not interfere. High away from us,

40:03.570 --> 40:07.115
and keep out of his evil deeds.

40:07.197 --> 40:08.199
Outside!

40:08.282 --> 40:09.324
Finally out!

40:09.409 --> 40:10.952
Listen the one-eyed.

40:11.661 --> 40:15.623
He knows what happens to those who do not obey.

40:15.998 --> 40:22.212
His eyes were not the only thing lost.

40:24.048 --> 40:24.882
Váyase

40:25.842 --> 40:26.718
Disappears!

40:30.347 --> 40:31.514
let sir.

40:43.985 --> 40:45.153
What the hell was that?

40:45.235 --> 40:47.029
Superstition, Master William.

40:47.112 --> 40:48.864
What have I done to excite dissatisfaction?

40:49.032 --> 40:51.951
Nose. They talked constantly about his father.

40:52.034 --> 40:54.286
Of my father? What's the matter with him.

40:54.704 --> 40:59.084
I do not know, sir. These people have came against intruders.

40:59.208 --> 41:02.044
They fear that want to take their land.

41:02.128 --> 41:04.713
We can help cooperate with each other.

41:04.797 --> 41:06.590
Not too much, sir approaches.

41:06.675 --> 41:08.176
You could take advantage of.

41:10.887 --> 41:13.640
Sarah says we should prefer nothing to respect, okay?

41:13.931 --> 41:15.307
Ja, sir.

41:36.829 --> 41:38.706
Do you like it here?

41:39.708 --> 41:41.751
Yes it is nice here.

41:44.545 --> 41:47.089
You and Lazarus, who seems to understand well.

41:48.132 --> 41:49.425
He is very kind.

41:50.885 --> 41:53.054
Why redeem Beiden?

41:54.472 --> 41:55.557
Things ...

41:57.599 --> 41:58.684
What things?

41:59.936 --> 42:01.646
He knows a lot about nature.

42:01.771 --> 42:03.898
Tracked and butterflies and such.

42:04.565 --> 42:05.649
Oh yeah.

42:08.318 --> 42:12.782
He said moths and butterflies carry the souls of the dead.

42:16.036 --> 42:19.789
He said mothers and fathers soul was in two beautiful moths.

42:19.873 --> 42:21.583
And where these moths being are?

42:26.420 --> 42:27.672
I can not tell.

42:32.010 --> 42:33.678
You believe?

42:35.722 --> 42:37.057
Yes maybe.

42:40.601 --> 42:42.644
Good ...

42:46.900 --> 42:49.110
time for girls.

43:00.454 --> 43:02.331
Have you ever wondered why?

43:03.375 --> 43:04.708
Why?

43:06.085 --> 43:08.212
Why we can not have itself.

43:11.800 --> 43:14.885
I prefer to think not about that. I accept it.

43:17.597 --> 43:21.851
Well, so, I find it very painful,

43:22.893 --> 43:25.062
I can give you any type.

43:26.356 --> 43:28.942
I'm like a dead tree without meaning and purpose.

43:29.025 --> 43:30.026
Please do not do.

43:30.110 --> 43:31.277
ASI is.

43:32.612 --> 43:34.697
Why did God do this to me?

43:35.989 --> 43:39.076
I was punished with a decomposing body. - Sarah, please.

43:41.413 --> 43:43.164
I make my own son?

43:44.206 --> 43:45.333
You have a child.

43:46.251 --> 43:47.711
A wonderful daughter.

43:48.670 --> 43:50.296
It is not mine.

43:52.798 --> 43:54.759
And that's never going to be like them.

43:54.842 --> 43:57.511
It goes completely embitter if you remain stubborn.

44:23.704 --> 44:27.958
I'm hungry.

44:29.543 --> 44:31.295
It is not time.

44:31.503 --> 44:35.174
You and the girl, you get closer to you.

44:36.342 --> 44:40.804
You begin to pass over me.

44:41.472 --> 44:43.807
In this way they earn their trust.

44:46.186 --> 44:48.813
I need it now.

44:49.396 --> 44:52.025
You know that it's still too early.

44:55.820 --> 45:00.867
Give me something about satisfying my hunger.

45:02.159 --> 45:03.911
There is nobody here.

45:04.661 --> 45:06.622
Then go to the people.

45:07.289 --> 45:09.918
You are asking too much.

45:10.126 --> 45:13.505
You do not love me.

45:13.630 --> 45:17.008
Stop doing that! Shut up!

45:17.759 --> 45:20.637
I will go to the people. I'll bring you something to eat.

45:38.405 --> 45:39.406
What happens?

45:39.489 --> 45:42.867
There is something strange.

45:47.371 --> 45:50.125
No, nothing. Perhaps a jackal or something.

45:50.250 --> 45:52.043
No, it's something else.

45:59.092 --> 46:03.680
This is too tight. We must pause.

46:03.762 --> 46:04.931
Y.

46:09.893 --> 46:11.770
Where do you come, Lazarus?

46:12.146 --> 46:13.605
Close up.

46:14.398 --> 46:18.235
From one village to the foot of the mountain.

46:29.329 --> 46:32.791
And you have a wife, family, children?

46:34.668 --> 46:36.962
She was a wife and a young daughter.

46:37.672 --> 46:41.050
They are dead. My wife died in childbirth.

46:41.175 --> 46:42.969
And then there was this fire.

46:44.262 --> 46:46.847
I could not save my daughter.

46:48.391 --> 46:50.476
Since then he walks.

46:51.393 --> 46:53.270
And so he came to Hemel op Aarde-?

46:54.688 --> 47:00.903
Hemel op Aarde-as you say, is a very special area.

47:02.697 --> 47:08.369
It is said that if it poses a kind of intersection here.

47:09.244 --> 47:11.121
S my culture ...

47:11.373 --> 47:15.251
it is believed that one can and this point with the ancestors ES contact occurred.

47:17.420 --> 47:20.090
You mean, you can talk to the dead?

47:22.509 --> 47:25.010
We all have ancestors, Master William.

47:25.844 --> 47:28.514
The ancestors seem very important to be you.

47:32.686 --> 47:34.771
Then you have this place that means a lot.

47:36.523 --> 47:37.731
Many know this?

47:38.233 --> 47:39.818
No, not many.

47:40.735 --> 47:43.238
Only those who were chosen by the ancestors.

47:44.114 --> 47:45.280
Are you chosen?

47:46.074 --> 47:47.909
My people regarded me as a healer.

47:48.117 --> 47:51.371
A man is able to communicate with the unknown.

47:52.871 --> 47:55.040
I have a rare gift, Master William.

47:57.251 --> 48:03.340
After the death of my daughter was a play a load.

48:06.969 --> 48:09.138
It is getting bigger, yes.

48:09.722 --> 48:12.599
If you eat more tan, you become moths soon.

48:13.184 --> 48:15.186
As Lazarus has given me.

48:16.646 --> 48:18.440
He is a very kind man.

48:50.304 --> 48:52.890
- Ruh dich aus, Lazarus. - Ja, sir.

50:17.934 --> 50:20.644
Sei still, mutters.

50:21.353 --> 50:24.565
Sei ganz yet.

52:18.096 --> 52:20.974
Hereby, I pay my debt.

52:42.996 --> 52:46.124
Calm down, Mother,

52:47.625 --> 52:51.045
it's over.

52:52.713 --> 52:55.215
Everything has been fulfilled.

54:13.420 --> 54:17.090
Still hungry.

54:18.800 --> 54:22.012
I said, it's still too early. They complain to stop.

54:23.596 --> 54:25.431
You left me in the house.

54:27.851 --> 54:30.769
It does not fit.

54:30.853 --> 54:34.481
You forgot me. Why, father?

54:36.985 --> 54:43.490
You're not my daughter. My daughter does not get bored with us.

54:49.748 --> 54:52.751
Sorry, baby. Excuse me.

55:00.342 --> 55:04.804
I can give you what you crave, Lazarus.

55:06.222 --> 55:09.351
He brings me the girl.

55:13.480 --> 55:18.275
The woman took me under suspicion.

55:20.070 --> 55:22.989
I take care of them.

55:52.893 --> 55:54.311
Sarah, can I join?

56:07.032 --> 56:08.242
Sarah!

56:10.994 --> 56:12.538
What did you do? Sarah!

56:15.333 --> 56:17.251
Something tried to kill me.

56:17.543 --> 56:20.797
- Do not try to kill .. - Something has tried ...

56:20.880 --> 56:23.883
Nothing is trying to kill. Only're stressed.

56:23.967 --> 56:26.177
That's just in your head ...

56:30.347 --> 56:35.769
Not in my mind, it's true ...

57:21.358 --> 57:22.359
Hi?

57:31.826 --> 57:34.286
I have to start the water pump at present.

57:34.371 --> 57:36.831
You can not always collect water from the dam.

57:37.498 --> 57:40.209
Yes, we can not sell the house in all modes.

57:41.503 --> 57:45.507
Therefore, I do not know, I start to like it. We could strutting all.

57:47.550 --> 57:49.135
No ridiculous seas.

57:50.052 --> 57:52.096
Que? A few cows, some chickens.

57:52.179 --> 57:54.556
Melkst morning you cows, Mary brings eggs ...

57:54.724 --> 57:56.851
You've planned everything, right?

57:57.434 --> 57:59.061
Yes. In any case, purely theoretical.

57:59.144 --> 58:01.815
Stop with daydreams and fix the pump.

58:02.898 --> 58:05.025
Maria still is a good idea. O Mary

58:05.318 --> 58:06.820
I think the big idea.

58:07.070 --> 58:08.697
Hermosa!

58:09.989 --> 58:10.990
Good

58:11.324 --> 58:15.537
Today I have the pump running. sorry

58:29.175 --> 58:31.845
I'll go and forage bang for my silkworms.

59:06.128 --> 59:07.422
It was him.

59:08.297 --> 59:11.216
I felt his presence yesterday.

59:12.969 --> 59:16.389
He warned.

59:17.056 --> 59:20.601
Warnings do not suffer evil away.

59:20.726 --> 59:24.855
I do not care. Malignant or nonmalignant, which must cease easy.

59:25.106 --> 59:28.401
I have a plan.

59:29.943 --> 59:32.780
Take this bag with you.

59:33.364 --> 59:38.202
Get him ourselves, grabs,

59:38.411 --> 59:42.956
the bag and then destroy it.

59:43.416 --> 59:45.460
Very simple.

59:45.626 --> 59:48.420
You are playing with fire.

59:48.922 --> 59:53.635
We have to wait for the right moment.

59:54.094 --> 59:56.804
I've heard enough of you much time.

59:56.887 --> 59:58.389
I'm not saying I went to do.

59:58.472 --> 01:00:01.141
I do not need your permission. She is my mother.

01:00:01.226 --> 01:00:02.227
My mother.

01:00:35.719 --> 01:00:36.720
Murmur.

01:00:39.264 --> 01:00:40.515
dream

01:00:42.434 --> 01:00:44.102
Sleep, mother.

01:00:44.853 --> 01:00:46.646
I will do it ...

01:00:48.398 --> 01:00:50.858
I will avenge his death.

01:00:51.693 --> 01:00:53.695
Yes, avenging.

01:00:55.237 --> 01:00:57.072
Sleep now, Mother.

01:00:58.949 --> 01:01:00.284
The dream.

01:02:16.695 --> 01:02:18.196
Pssssssssttt.

01:03:00.070 --> 01:03:02.114
Would you like to like to see my track?

01:03:30.059 --> 01:03:31.478
Mary?

01:03:33.896 --> 01:03:38.317
Toto is there in the corner. I had one, Mr. grandfather.

01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:41.445
He died a few days ago. But that's okay.

01:03:41.528 --> 01:03:44.574
I got buried out there in the field. - Hears! Who are you talking about?

01:05:08.742 --> 01:05:10.076
You were you?

01:05:14.539 --> 01:05:16.291
Do not be afraid.

01:05:17.791 --> 01:05:19.418
See it.

01:05:20.461 --> 01:05:21.755
See it.

01:05:22.755 --> 01:05:24.715
See to it that Satansbrut.

01:05:24.798 --> 01:05:25.842
They see it!

01:06:02.628 --> 01:06:06.257
For you miss seeing.

01:06:08.467 --> 01:06:12.721
You had no choice. He would have killed me.

01:06:14.766 --> 01:06:18.269
Maybe I should have let this happen.

01:07:04.023 --> 01:07:08.652
If you going to kill me, you need ...

01:07:11.989 --> 01:07:13.240
try harder.

01:07:13.407 --> 01:07:16.786
You devil! - I'm not a demon,

01:07:16.994 --> 01:07:18.746
but the spirit of a father.

01:07:21.541 --> 01:07:27.255
You bear no guilt and death. I can give you peace.

01:07:28.757 --> 01:07:32.217
Peace? Never

01:07:35.304 --> 01:07:38.557
All curses can cancel.

01:07:39.059 --> 01:07:43.021
I burn, burn everything.

01:07:45.398 --> 01:07:47.692
They are burning ...

01:08:13.259 --> 01:08:15.969
You've made a murderer out of me.

01:08:19.099 --> 01:08:22.600
I can not anymore. You can not do it someone else?

01:08:22.725 --> 01:08:25.939
Must be the girl.

01:08:26.523 --> 01:08:28.733
Should be to ...

01:08:29.649 --> 01:08:31.443
So tonight then.

01:08:34.072 --> 01:08:36.282
¡William!

01:08:38.243 --> 01:08:41.037
I told you that something is wrong with Lazarus.

01:08:41.162 --> 01:08:42.287
And not at all.

01:08:42.372 --> 01:08:44.499
I told you, you should stop doing.

01:08:44.582 --> 01:08:46.626
Lazarus has a girl in the bag.

01:08:46.710 --> 01:08:50.087
Will you trust! You have to let go, there's something wrong.

01:08:51.087 --> 01:08:53.216
There is certainly an explanation for everything.

01:08:53.298 --> 01:08:55.260
He is a murderer and an evil man.

01:08:55.885 --> 01:08:57.470
You should rest.

01:08:57.970 --> 01:09:01.015
I need it. We need it here.

01:09:01.099 --> 01:09:03.100
William, going to tell you now.

01:09:03.350 --> 01:09:05.935
So help me God. Otherwise I'll get Mary.

01:09:06.104 --> 01:09:07.645
And never see again.

01:09:08.604 --> 01:09:10.733
What are you talking about? Lazarus is not a murderer.

01:09:10.817 --> 01:09:12.444
I know what I saw.

01:09:12.527 --> 01:09:15.279
Do not! Finally, I can talk to someone!

01:09:15.363 --> 01:09:17.240
Someone who listens! - Mary, sea enough.

01:09:17.323 --> 01:09:18.615
You should listen to it.

01:09:18.867 --> 01:09:21.118
William, go down and tell him.

01:09:21.453 --> 01:09:22.787
Mary, stay with me.

01:09:23.703 --> 01:09:26.957
I warn you. Listen to ridiculous.

01:09:27.125 --> 01:09:29.542
And take responsibility for their actions.

01:10:10.251 --> 01:10:12.837
Lazarus, I'm sorry, but I have to let you go.

01:10:13.837 --> 01:10:15.631
It just does not fit right.

01:10:16.591 --> 01:10:18.093
An attempt is worth war.

01:10:19.386 --> 01:10:24.682
I ... I have even a little money. Alone ...

01:10:25.307 --> 01:10:28.811
Please take it. Maybe it helps you get back to his feet.

01:10:31.689 --> 01:10:32.940
He has cut himself.

01:10:34.234 --> 01:10:38.863
Yes, but nothing happens, sir ...

01:10:41.740 --> 01:10:42.867
Maestro.

01:10:44.077 --> 01:10:47.163
Thanks for giving me this opportunity.

01:10:48.331 --> 01:10:51.167
Aber, sir, that will stay with Geld von Ihnen.

01:10:53.293 --> 01:10:57.590
Could be a single bit tonight?

01:10:58.007 --> 01:10:59.717
Of course, staying one more night.

01:11:01.301 --> 01:11:04.304
I wanted to thank you for the good work me just personally.

01:11:06.850 --> 01:11:10.311
Lazarus, I do not like the question, but I can look in your bag?

01:11:11.938 --> 01:11:13.648
Only for curiosity.

01:11:15.399 --> 01:11:16.567
Of course Mr.

01:11:28.203 --> 01:11:30.081
Diesel is all, sir.

01:11:30.497 --> 01:11:32.500
I wanted to go and get new degree.

01:11:32.625 --> 01:11:35.295
No, stay here. Spend the night.

01:11:36.087 --> 01:11:40.342
You had a hard day. Cutting and care'll get the diesel.

01:11:40.507 --> 01:11:43.761
That's not right, sir. The family is above everything.

01:11:59.652 --> 01:12:01.279
On the hand, Sarah!

01:12:01.863 --> 01:12:03.655
He has a bloody cut!

01:12:03.823 --> 01:12:06.284
Do you have any idea what it was embarrassing for me?

01:12:06.408 --> 01:12:08.536
He stays overnight and leave tomorrow morning.

01:12:08.703 --> 01:12:10.705
That's not enough. Now you need to go.

01:12:10.788 --> 01:12:13.666
Then you will! I keep his paranoia.

01:12:13.832 --> 01:12:15.626
Ich hol den Diesel generator.

01:12:22.300 --> 01:12:24.177
Then I do.

01:13:28.867 --> 01:13:31.869
Mary! Mary, are you there?

01:13:32.412 --> 01:13:34.164
Lazarus? Are you?

01:13:39.252 --> 01:13:41.963
Mary, come with me.

01:13:42.338 --> 01:13:43.756
I want to show you something.

01:13:44.256 --> 01:13:45.382
Where is everybody?

01:13:46.634 --> 01:13:49.261
You want to get fuel for the generator.

01:13:51.389 --> 01:13:52.931
Calvo can back.

01:13:53.682 --> 01:13:57.520
Come with me. And bring their silkworms.

01:14:36.016 --> 01:14:37.101
Hola people!

01:14:50.364 --> 01:14:51.615
Where are you?

01:14:53.618 --> 01:14:54.786
Mary?

01:15:01.167 --> 01:15:02.335
Sarah?

01:15:23.355 --> 01:15:25.274
It was you done with them?

01:15:27.860 --> 01:15:29.487
Where are they?

01:15:34.617 --> 01:15:35.869
singing stops.

01:15:37.453 --> 01:15:38.871
Stop singing!

01:15:40.247 --> 01:15:41.498
Stop singing!

01:15:43.126 --> 01:15:44.418
corner stops!

01:15:50.175 --> 01:15:53.261
They have. Those he called Lazarus.

01:15:53.345 --> 01:15:56.847
What are you talking about? What's going on here? Sarah?

01:16:00.726 --> 01:16:02.519
Sarah!

01:16:04.396 --> 01:16:06.315
What happens? Sarah, look at me.

01:16:06.565 --> 01:16:07.608
Talk to me!

01:16:08.525 --> 01:16:09.568
Comino

01:16:14.948 --> 01:16:17.326
I'm sorry. That's all my fault.

01:16:17.452 --> 01:16:20.246
Sarah ... Sarah!

01:16:25.752 --> 01:16:27.921
Mr. You should listen.

01:16:28.003 --> 01:16:29.046
Where is maria!

01:16:29.255 --> 01:16:30.965
There is no time to lose.

01:16:31.131 --> 01:16:33.592
Her family has to deal with a demon.

01:16:34.176 --> 01:16:35.719
foreign powder.

01:16:36.054 --> 01:16:37.346
It is called souls.

01:16:37.846 --> 01:16:39.349
With the help of Lazarus.

01:16:39.599 --> 01:16:41.726
Mary is at great risk.

01:16:41.810 --> 01:16:43.186
Was it dust?

01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:45.230
Follow our followers.

01:16:45.438 --> 01:16:47.815
And bring back here Mary.

01:16:48.483 --> 01:16:50.360
I'll stay here with his wife.

01:16:50.652 --> 01:16:52.153
Go! Now!

01:16:52.278 --> 01:16:53.570
What is this?

01:16:55.573 --> 01:16:56.950
What is this?

01:16:57.701 --> 01:16:58.868
They carried her.

01:17:00.244 --> 01:17:04.207
You tell me where he is now, or distribution of your brain on my property.

01:17:04.416 --> 01:17:09.962
If the trigger is pulled, the rest of his family is lost.

01:17:10.505 --> 01:17:12.923
Maria needs you, William.

01:17:13.007 --> 01:17:14.466
You have to go.

01:17:15.260 --> 01:17:17.052
If you lie to me, old ...

01:17:17.929 --> 01:17:19.389
I come back

01:17:20.890 --> 01:17:23.893
I'm sorry, Sarah. I come back soon.

01:17:25.353 --> 01:17:26.980
Bring me the goat.

01:17:36.655 --> 01:17:38.158
How do you know this song?

01:17:40.784 --> 01:17:42.162
The song?

01:17:43.162 --> 01:17:44.580
Pululáis constantly.

01:17:46.207 --> 01:17:49.127
I sang my daughter to sleep there.

01:17:51.212 --> 01:17:52.547
Where is he now?

01:17:53.547 --> 01:17:55.090
She sleeps.

01:18:00.180 --> 01:18:02.515
I lost some time ago.

01:18:06.185 --> 01:18:09.646
Obviously, you need a daughter and a father.

01:18:12.274 --> 01:18:13.734
Give me your hand.

01:18:17.697 --> 01:18:19.114
Y así now do.

01:18:22.452 --> 01:18:23.744
I now speak.

01:18:25.037 --> 01:18:27.790
I promise to take care of you when you can.

01:18:28.166 --> 01:18:29.793
And he never wounded.

01:18:31.627 --> 01:18:33.212
This is a great promise.

01:18:35.047 --> 01:18:38.635
I do not think you can keep that promise.

01:18:42.846 --> 01:18:46.350
I promise to take care of you when you can.

01:18:49.229 --> 01:18:51.356
And he never wounded.

01:18:52.940 --> 01:18:54.818
And now tremble.

01:18:57.237 --> 01:18:59.197
Now we must be together forever.

01:19:40.070 --> 01:19:41.280
Drinking out.

01:19:45.702 --> 01:19:49.247
Are the stars of the night is is to see his brilliantly.

01:20:04.804 --> 01:20:08.224
It is soft dark and light appears.

01:20:14.480 --> 01:20:16.398
Be prepared.

01:20:19.819 --> 01:20:22.697
It is said that the stars were the souls of people,

01:20:24.114 --> 01:20:25.657
I had to move on.

01:20:29.537 --> 01:20:31.831
They look upon us,

01:20:34.751 --> 01:20:37.671
and look through the curtain of darkness.

01:20:40.215 --> 01:20:45.095
And they remind us that are still with us.

01:21:04.905 --> 01:21:07.033
Sleep well, my son.

01:21:07.867 --> 01:21:09.494
His one here works ...

01:21:11.704 --> 01:21:13.206
you do

01:21:18.795 --> 01:21:20.212
Excuse me.

01:21:25.635 --> 01:21:27.052
I'm here

01:21:28.012 --> 01:21:30.849
Keep the goat ready.

01:21:40.442 --> 01:21:42.444
Because it thinks? - Pssst!

01:21:43.069 --> 01:21:44.195
Keep a solid defense.

01:22:08.552 --> 01:22:09.636
hold

01:22:11.680 --> 01:22:12.806
past

01:22:13.140 --> 01:22:14.141
Enough?

01:22:14.225 --> 01:22:15.226
So is.

01:23:01.730 --> 01:23:07.653
Thank you, my ancestors are, thank you.

01:23:09.655 --> 01:23:13.158
Dark, spirit poisoned!

01:23:13.702 --> 01:23:17.288
You do not belong here. Go and never show your face again!

01:23:23.086 --> 01:23:24.963
Henceforth I thee, evil spirit!

01:23:25.671 --> 01:23:29.259
You do not belong here. Disappear or get killed!

01:23:34.305 --> 01:23:35.849
dust

01:23:37.225 --> 01:23:41.021
My fault was installed.

01:23:53.115 --> 01:23:54.826
What have you done?

01:23:55.534 --> 01:23:56.911
I'm sorry.

01:24:39.662 --> 01:24:41.581
Wake!

01:24:43.082 --> 01:24:45.125
Wake!

01:25:21.537 --> 01:25:26.375
Sarah

01:25:28.586 --> 01:25:34.634
Sarah

01:26:15.341 --> 01:26:16.717
I have a headache.

01:26:18.261 --> 01:26:19.721
Do not worry.

01:26:20.220 --> 01:26:22.389
Bald sounds again.

01:26:25.225 --> 01:26:26.685
That's not our yard.

01:26:28.145 --> 01:26:29.688
You're right.

01:26:30.189 --> 01:26:31.774
This is not your home.

01:26:33.068 --> 01:26:34.610
Where we are?

01:26:35.904 --> 01:26:40.075
We're somewhere and nowhere.

01:26:42.034 --> 01:26:45.037
It is a world between worlds.

01:26:46.081 --> 01:26:50.210
In place of vacuum insulation.

01:26:50.542 --> 01:26:52.002
I do not understand.

01:26:52.837 --> 01:26:54.798
I was sitting by the fire ...

01:26:56.091 --> 01:26:57.634
and I fell asleep me.

01:26:59.677 --> 01:27:01.095
Ja, then the war is.

01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:06.976
He fell asleep in a world to wake up in this.

01:27:15.443 --> 01:27:16.820
See it.

01:27:23.993 --> 01:27:27.580
I want to show someone around.

01:27:28.163 --> 01:27:30.416
Mom? Father!

01:27:37.465 --> 01:27:38.591
What's happening here?

01:27:39.759 --> 01:27:41.761
Mom! Father! - Beruhige dich ...

01:27:42.302 --> 01:27:44.805
Where are you? Return! Do not!

01:27:44.930 --> 01:27:47.016
Calm down. Calm down.

01:27:47.100 --> 01:27:49.728
Let me go. - Listen, hear my voice.

01:27:49.853 --> 01:27:51.813
Listen to my voice.

01:27:52.855 --> 01:27:54.940
Close your eyes.

01:27:55.274 --> 01:27:58.068
Close your eyes.

01:27:59.154 --> 01:28:03.199
Listen to my voice.

01:28:03.949 --> 01:28:09.163
Close your eyes.

01:28:18.422 --> 01:28:19.882
It was see?

01:28:24.845 --> 01:28:26.513
Our old house.

01:28:32.561 --> 01:28:34.564
I remember that day.

01:29:01.256 --> 01:29:02.759
Aunt Sarah?

01:29:17.774 --> 01:29:23.613
Mary? You have to make a decision now.

01:29:28.368 --> 01:29:30.787
This is Mary.

01:29:32.037 --> 01:29:33.789
This is your soul.

01:29:38.752 --> 01:29:41.715
Now you have the chance to go to their parents,

01:29:42.131 --> 01:29:44.509
I return to the real world.

01:29:50.097 --> 01:29:52.350
Why do you do this to me?

01:29:57.021 --> 01:29:58.856
I'm sorry.

01:30:01.192 --> 01:30:03.319
Sorry, Mary.

01:30:05.779 --> 01:30:08.992
This was the only way to save my daughter Vuyiswa.

01:30:15.039 --> 01:30:18.292
I'm sorry. I betrayed you.

01:30:20.837 --> 01:30:22.088
I'm sorry.

01:30:22.463 --> 01:30:24.631
I've broken our oath.

01:30:26.426 --> 01:30:28.136
I'm sorry.

01:30:29.636 --> 01:30:31.972
He violated his promise.

01:30:36.519 --> 01:30:38.688
It was now going on with you?

01:30:43.859 --> 01:30:49.031
Perhaps these rocks have mercy on an old man.

01:30:59.501 --> 01:31:02.253
Do not be afraid, Lazarus.

01:31:07.216 --> 01:31:08.592
Mary.

01:31:10.261 --> 01:31:14.265
You've made an old man a wonderful gift, my son.

01:31:20.854 --> 01:31:22.189
Give me your hand.

01:31:33.784 --> 01:31:35.537
Repeat after me.

01:31:41.292 --> 01:31:43.378
I promise not to forget.

01:31:47.798 --> 01:31:50.051
I promise not to forget.

01:31:55.140 --> 01:31:58.101
I promise that we will meet someday.

01:32:03.605 --> 01:32:07.027
I promise that we will meet someday.

01:32:15.534 --> 01:32:16.661
And now tremble.

01:33:07.252 --> 01:33:08.505
Thank you.

01:33:11.800 --> 01:33:13.092
I'm pregnant.

01:33:14.051 --> 01:33:15.094
It was?

01:33:17.305 --> 01:33:19.974
As well? - I dont know.

01:33:20.684 --> 01:33:22.394
I'm pregnant.

01:33:30.652 --> 01:33:32.028
Good day.

01:33:32.237 --> 01:33:33.363
Y

01:33:34.279 --> 01:33:36.740
I think you need some help here.

01:33:37.908 --> 01:33:40.619
Thank you. We'll be fine.

01:33:41.078 --> 01:33:44.248
I'm sorry, who with her daughter.

01:33:45.417 --> 01:33:47.002
She's not my daughter.

01:33:48.502 --> 01:33:52.381
Let's get along, and we will miss him.

01:34:08.273 --> 01:34:11.067
But with your help, we have created a paradise here.

01:34:13.360 --> 01:34:17.448
A good tree produces rotten fruit.

01:34:31.628 --> 01:34:33.881
I'm hikers,

01:34:35.050 --> 01:34:36.926
always searching.

01:34:39.136 --> 01:34:41.930
You are in me and I in you.

01:34:44.559 --> 01:34:46.644
And we will meet again.

01:34:49.271 --> 01:34:51.190
You can not fool me.

01:34:51.483 --> 01:34:53.275
Man can not fool me.

01:34:54.735 --> 01:34:58.030
I am walkers. And you are mine.

01:35:00.033 --> 01:35:01.743
Forever.
