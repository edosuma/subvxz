WEBVTT

00:27.200 --> 00:29.360
Steady...

01:55.320 --> 01:58.800
If elected, Republican
presidential candidate Donald Trump

01:58.840 --> 02:00.000
is threatening to impose tariffs

02:00.000 --> 02:00.640
is threatening to impose tariffs

02:00.680 --> 02:04.480
and bring cases against China
in the US and WTO.

02:04.520 --> 02:08.000
Mr Trump maintains
that China has been engaged

02:08.000 --> 02:08.360
Mr Trump maintains
that China has been engaged

02:08.400 --> 02:10.640
in unfair trading practices
for decades.

02:10.680 --> 02:12.600
Mr Ruggero?
Yes?

02:12.640 --> 02:15.920
Good to see you up and about.
How are you feeling today?

02:15.960 --> 02:16.000
I'm fine, thanks.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.800
I'm fine, thanks.

02:17.840 --> 02:20.680
I'm not sure you're aware, but
you've had quite a few visitors.

02:20.720 --> 02:23.320
They left that overnight
bag with your clothes.

02:25.400 --> 02:28.600
Was there a woman? Chinese?
Miss Wu?

02:28.640 --> 02:30.800
Hm. She came quite a few times.

02:40.400 --> 02:42.400
Is something wrong?

02:43.400 --> 02:45.480
Something's missing from my things.

02:46.680 --> 02:48.000
Everything that came in with you
should be there.

02:48.000 --> 02:48.800
Everything that came in with you
should be there.

02:48.840 --> 02:51.480
The nurses will have collected it
and put it safely in that bag.

02:51.520 --> 02:53.800
It's not here.

02:53.840 --> 02:56.000
I'll ask.
I need to know who's been in here.

02:56.000 --> 02:56.560
I'll ask.
I need to know who's been in here.

02:57.640 --> 03:00.320
We don't keep a list.

03:01.440 --> 03:03.800
Mr Ruggero, we had to put you
into an induced coma

03:03.840 --> 03:04.000
to avoid swelling of the brain.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.360
to avoid swelling of the brain.

03:05.400 --> 03:09.040
It's normal for some patients
to feel enhanced emotions after...

03:09.080 --> 03:11.800
Doctor, listen, OK?
Doctor, listen to me.

03:11.840 --> 03:12.000
Someone took something
that belonged to me.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.240
Someone took something
that belonged to me.

03:14.280 --> 03:16.280
I need to find it.

03:16.320 --> 03:18.920
I'll ask the nurses, of course.

03:18.960 --> 03:20.000
I've got your prescription
right here. OK.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.640
I've got your prescription
right here. OK.

03:21.680 --> 03:23.960
Where do I sign to get out of here?

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
Good morning.
Hello.

04:17.760 --> 04:19.840
Didn't your mother
tell you to look both ways

04:19.880 --> 04:21.280
before crossing the street?

04:26.600 --> 04:30.480
You should be home resting.
No, I'm fine, really.

04:30.520 --> 04:32.000
You came to see me
at the hospital, right?

04:32.000 --> 04:33.040
You came to see me
at the hospital, right?

04:33.080 --> 04:35.680
Yeah, several times.

04:35.720 --> 04:39.120
Were you ever there with Dominic?
Why?

04:40.920 --> 04:43.480
Bring me up to speed.
Sure.

04:49.040 --> 04:51.240
Bad time?

04:51.280 --> 04:55.480
If you've got a sandwich,
a litre of Scotch,

04:55.520 --> 04:56.000
or a 110 billion in bonds,
then your timing is perfect.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.840
or a 110 billion in bonds,
then your timing is perfect.

04:58.880 --> 05:01.040
Just wanted to check in on the 5G.

05:01.080 --> 05:04.000
Well, I'm looking at investing
in a consortium of companies

05:04.000 --> 05:04.280
Well, I'm looking at investing
in a consortium of companies

05:04.320 --> 05:05.920
to spread the risk.

05:05.960 --> 05:08.080
I'm sure Liwei would prefer
a single vendor.

05:08.120 --> 05:10.600
A Chinese vendor?
Almost certainly.

05:12.520 --> 05:15.440
But you're right,
this is the better strategy.

05:15.480 --> 05:17.640
Can I keep this?
Yeah. Sure.

05:17.680 --> 05:20.000
Thanks for backing me up,
I owe you one. Just buy me a coffee.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.160
Thanks for backing me up,
I owe you one. Just buy me a coffee.

05:21.880 --> 05:26.320
After the shitstorm with Bitcoin,
Dominic has been across everything.

05:26.360 --> 05:28.000
And erm...

05:28.000 --> 05:28.400
And erm...

05:28.440 --> 05:32.120
"Ms Rain Man" over there has got
eyes in the back of her head.

05:32.160 --> 05:33.640
Although, since you've been gone,

05:33.680 --> 05:36.000
I think she spent more time
on chat forums than anything else.

05:36.000 --> 05:36.240
I think she spent more time
on chat forums than anything else.

05:37.520 --> 05:39.280
Have you said anything to her?

05:39.320 --> 05:42.080
She works for Dominic.
OK.

05:46.160 --> 05:48.360
Massimo.

05:48.400 --> 05:51.240
It's good to see you back.
It's good to be back.

05:51.280 --> 05:52.000
You look a lot better than the last
time I saw you.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.680
You look a lot better than the last
time I saw you.

05:53.720 --> 05:55.680
Not great, but better.

05:56.640 --> 05:59.960
Do you mind if I have
a moment alone with Massimo?

06:00.000 --> 06:01.480
Of course.

06:05.040 --> 06:07.760
Something wrong?
I got a tip last night.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.760
British Telecom and Huawei

06:10.800 --> 06:14.520
are entering into
a research partnership on 5G.

06:14.560 --> 06:16.000
The UK in China's column.

06:16.000 --> 06:16.480
The UK in China's column.

06:16.520 --> 06:19.040
That's a setback for us.
It's more than a setback.

06:19.080 --> 06:22.280
Whoever controls 5G, wins the war.

06:22.320 --> 06:24.000
He said that UK to be one
of the world's leaders in 5G.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.320
He said that UK to be one
of the world's leaders in 5G.

06:25.360 --> 06:28.160
The Chinese want to be first,
the Japanese want to be first,

06:28.200 --> 06:29.920
the Koreans want to be first...

06:29.960 --> 06:32.000
If Trump takes the White House, he's
saying he'll block China in the WTO.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.680
If Trump takes the White House, he's
saying he'll block China in the WTO.

06:33.720 --> 06:37.160
So the UK can't close
a 5G deal with China.

06:38.080 --> 06:40.000
Well, the polls say he's gonna lose.

06:40.000 --> 06:40.200
Well, the polls say he's gonna lose.

06:40.240 --> 06:42.360
They said the same about Brexit.

06:45.160 --> 06:47.960
We can't afford to wait
until November.

06:49.360 --> 06:52.080
I'll game some countermoves.

06:53.520 --> 06:54.960
By the way, what happened?

06:56.840 --> 06:58.400
You didn't see the car coming?

07:00.800 --> 07:02.040
I guess.

07:03.520 --> 07:04.000
Take care of yourself.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.480
Take care of yourself.

07:05.520 --> 07:08.680
Eleanor's great,
but we still need you.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.040
OK, good.

07:14.080 --> 07:17.720
You sure you're OK to work?
Don't worry, I've got this.

07:37.960 --> 07:40.840
Chinese food.
Irony isn't lost on me.

07:42.120 --> 07:44.000
Come in.

07:44.000 --> 07:44.120
Come in.

07:55.680 --> 07:57.960
I was glad to get your call.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
Yeah, well...
You know, I've been thinking.

08:00.000 --> 08:00.920
Yeah, well...
You know, I've been thinking.

08:02.520 --> 08:05.680
After Kalim,
and then your accident...

08:06.720 --> 08:08.000
How easy it is to lose
the people who matter.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.520
How easy it is to lose
the people who matter.

08:12.360 --> 08:15.880
You are Adrian's godfather, right?
How is he doing?

08:15.920 --> 08:16.000
He is a pain in the arse.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.120
He is a pain in the arse.

08:18.160 --> 08:21.400
And his birthday
is gonna cost me a fortune.

08:21.440 --> 08:23.920
It's a good thing he's so
bloody cute, I'm telling you.

08:28.800 --> 08:31.040
Look, so...

08:31.080 --> 08:32.000
What happened?

08:32.000 --> 08:33.080
What happened?

08:33.120 --> 08:36.160
I mean, you obviously
didn't lead Dominic to Nakamoto.

08:37.320 --> 08:40.000
No. A few hours later
you nearly get killed.

08:40.000 --> 08:40.600
No. A few hours later
you nearly get killed.

08:42.920 --> 08:46.080
Well...
It was an accident, that's all.

08:48.440 --> 08:50.600
Massimo.

08:50.640 --> 08:52.800
This is about Kalim, our friend.

08:53.960 --> 08:56.000
I'm telling you what happened.

08:56.000 --> 08:56.520
I'm telling you what happened.

08:58.560 --> 09:00.160
You don't trust me anymore?

09:00.960 --> 09:03.240
OK, do you want to talk?
Let's talk.

09:08.080 --> 09:10.480
Did you know about me and Zhi?

09:10.520 --> 09:12.000
What? No.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.240
What? No.

09:13.280 --> 09:15.760
So you didn't tell Liwei about that?

09:18.480 --> 09:20.000
What the hell makes you think
I did that?

09:20.000 --> 09:20.640
What the hell makes you think
I did that?

09:20.680 --> 09:23.400
I'm not thinking, I'm just trying
to understand what's going on.

09:23.440 --> 09:25.560
By accusing me
of going behind your back?

09:28.600 --> 09:30.600
Forget this.
Oliver, stay, please.

09:30.640 --> 09:33.360
Why? So we can pretend
we're still friends?

09:33.400 --> 09:35.400
We are still friends.

09:36.760 --> 09:39.320
I can't do this.

09:39.360 --> 09:42.160
Enjoy your Chinese, man.

10:03.880 --> 10:06.320
Hey, thanks for doing this.

10:06.360 --> 10:08.000
So it's 40, right?
That's right.

10:08.000 --> 10:08.120
So it's 40, right?
That's right.

10:11.960 --> 10:14.560
How was everything?
They were easy. Thanks.

10:14.600 --> 10:16.000
We'll keep this between us, right?
Sure.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.320
We'll keep this between us, right?
Sure.

10:23.800 --> 10:24.000
Daddy,
why is there somebody at your car?

10:24.000 --> 10:26.040
Daddy,
why is there somebody at your car?

10:29.560 --> 10:31.600
Shit!
OK, let's spend some extra time...

10:37.640 --> 10:40.000
Wait one second.

10:40.000 --> 10:40.320
Wait one second.

10:40.360 --> 10:43.160
Wanna watch some TV? Yeah?
Watch some TV?

10:43.200 --> 10:44.640
Let me just...

10:44.680 --> 10:46.960
Just give him something to watch,
yeah? OK.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
Thanks.
What are we going to watch?

10:48.000 --> 10:48.760
Thanks.
What are we going to watch?

11:18.280 --> 11:20.000
Hey.

11:20.000 --> 11:20.280
Hey.

11:22.560 --> 11:26.360
Did you leave your mobile behind?
Your wish is my command.

11:26.400 --> 11:28.000
You think we're being tracked?
I'm certain I am.

11:28.000 --> 11:28.920
You think we're being tracked?
I'm certain I am.

11:28.960 --> 11:31.520
By whom?
Dominic.

11:33.120 --> 11:36.000
He wanted me to think
the Chinese killed Kalim, but...

11:36.000 --> 11:36.560
He wanted me to think
the Chinese killed Kalim, but...

11:36.600 --> 11:39.320
I think he's involved.

11:39.360 --> 11:40.920
I see...

11:40.960 --> 11:44.000
I take it
your accident was no accident.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.200
I take it
your accident was no accident.

11:45.240 --> 11:49.520
I found a memory stick
Damian Curtis gave Kalim.

11:49.560 --> 11:52.000
That's what they were trying to get.
Why? What's on it?

11:52.000 --> 11:52.040
That's what they were trying to get.
Why? What's on it?

11:52.080 --> 11:55.880
I don't know, it's disappeared.
Something to do with Brexit.

11:55.920 --> 11:59.520
Does anybody else
know anything about this? No.

11:59.560 --> 12:00.000
It's...It's too dangerous.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.560
It's...It's too dangerous.

12:01.600 --> 12:03.920
Well, why are you bloody telling me?

12:03.960 --> 12:07.840
Because I need your help, Phil.
What kind of help do you need?

12:07.880 --> 12:08.000
BT and Huawei
are joining forces to research 5G.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.920
BT and Huawei
are joining forces to research 5G.

12:12.040 --> 12:15.160
And Dominic wants me
to find a way to block it.

12:16.080 --> 12:19.400
Well, you can hardly say no.
I don't need to.

12:22.080 --> 12:24.000
What have you got up your sleeve
this time, Ruggero?

12:24.000 --> 12:24.640
What have you got up your sleeve
this time, Ruggero?

12:24.680 --> 12:25.960
Another way.

12:26.000 --> 12:29.080
One that ensures neither China,
nor the US win the data war.

12:30.720 --> 12:32.000
What other way is there?

12:32.000 --> 12:33.200
What other way is there?

12:33.240 --> 12:38.360
A consortium of European 5G
companies to protect Europe's data.

12:38.400 --> 12:40.000
Our privacy and our freedom.
A worthy cause.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.560
Our privacy and our freedom.
A worthy cause.

12:43.840 --> 12:45.720
But almost certainly a lost one.

12:45.760 --> 12:47.360
The 13th floor
would try and stop us.

12:47.400 --> 12:48.000
Who, us?
Yes.

12:48.000 --> 12:48.640
Who, us?
Yes.

12:48.680 --> 12:52.720
Well,
I haven't agreed to anything yet.

12:54.240 --> 12:56.000
What you need is an anchor investor
with deep pockets...

12:56.000 --> 12:58.720
What you need is an anchor investor
with deep pockets...

12:59.800 --> 13:01.800
..a hand in 5G...

13:03.720 --> 13:04.000
..and balls as big as yours.

13:04.000 --> 13:07.280
..and balls as big as yours.

13:14.680 --> 13:16.680
I have someone in mind.

13:24.520 --> 13:28.000
Carter, you should be in bed.
Er... Couldn't sleep.

13:28.000 --> 13:28.640
Carter, you should be in bed.
Er... Couldn't sleep.

13:28.680 --> 13:31.520
Brush your teeth, now.

13:31.560 --> 13:33.320
Sorry, little man, go on.

13:38.000 --> 13:41.480
Have you locked the gate?
Yeah, why?

13:41.520 --> 13:44.000
I'm just asking.
Thanks for getting home on time.

13:44.000 --> 13:44.480
I'm just asking.
Thanks for getting home on time.

13:45.520 --> 13:47.520
Yeah.

13:51.240 --> 13:52.000
How is Zhi?
She's fine.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.840
How is Zhi?
She's fine.

13:54.960 --> 13:56.400
Why'd you ask?

13:58.480 --> 14:00.000
Promise me you won't say anything.

14:00.000 --> 14:00.280
Promise me you won't say anything.

14:01.760 --> 14:03.560
Yeah, I promise.

14:04.760 --> 14:08.000
I saw her at the hospital,
outside the maternity ward.

14:08.000 --> 14:08.240
I saw her at the hospital,
outside the maternity ward.

14:08.280 --> 14:11.760
What, Zhi's pregnant?
Look, just leave it.

14:11.800 --> 14:14.640
Maybe she just couldn't find
anywhere else to park.

14:15.640 --> 14:16.000
It's her business.

14:16.000 --> 14:16.920
It's her business.

14:21.680 --> 14:24.000
Hey, sweetie! Let me see.

14:24.000 --> 14:24.360
Hey, sweetie! Let me see.

14:25.560 --> 14:29.320
Shiny! Well done! Squeaky clean!

14:31.160 --> 14:32.000
Remember what I told you
about brushing them at the back?

14:32.000 --> 14:34.080
Remember what I told you
about brushing them at the back?

14:40.480 --> 14:43.120
You all right, sweetie?

14:43.160 --> 14:45.880
Are secrets good or bad?

14:47.560 --> 14:48.000
Well, it depends.

14:48.000 --> 14:48.880
Well, it depends.

14:48.920 --> 14:53.640
If the secret is a surprise,
like a gift, then it's OK.

14:53.680 --> 14:56.000
But if it's likely to hurt someone,
then no.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.760
But if it's likely to hurt someone,
then no.

14:59.200 --> 15:02.000
You know, I'll never be mad
about anything you tell me...

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
..as long as it's the truth.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
..as long as it's the truth.

15:08.200 --> 15:11.400
Daddy didn't get home on time.

15:11.440 --> 15:12.000
He got Anna to babysit.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.120
He got Anna to babysit.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.240
He said not to tell.

15:17.280 --> 15:19.520
Did I say the right thing?

15:21.480 --> 15:25.320
Yes. Yes, you did.
Come on, wipe.

15:25.360 --> 15:27.360
All right, bed! Go, go. Go, go, go.

16:31.640 --> 16:32.000
I think I found it.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
I think I found it.

16:37.000 --> 16:40.000
A Swedish company, FramTek. Their
technology is an open platform.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.200
A Swedish company, FramTek. Their
technology is an open platform.

16:41.240 --> 16:45.040
It allows multiple of 5G networks
to share a common infrastructure.

16:45.080 --> 16:47.160
Is it scalable?
So they tell me.

16:47.200 --> 16:48.000
They're not on NYL's radar?
Not yet.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.560
They're not on NYL's radar?
Not yet.

16:49.600 --> 16:53.160
But they're looking to IPO,
so we'd have to move quickly. OK.

16:53.200 --> 16:56.000
Let's go to Sweden. I'm pretty sure
you shouldn't be flying yet.

16:56.000 --> 16:56.960
Let's go to Sweden. I'm pretty sure
you shouldn't be flying yet.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.960
Anyway,
they have an office in London.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.240
Good, set it up. Oh, El?

17:02.120 --> 17:04.000
Leave FramTek
out of tomorrow's meeting pack.

17:04.000 --> 17:04.360
Leave FramTek
out of tomorrow's meeting pack.

17:04.400 --> 17:06.320
Just use the other prospects.

17:07.840 --> 17:09.360
I'm sure you have your reasons,

17:09.400 --> 17:11.520
but it won't be long
before they're big news.

17:11.560 --> 17:12.000
I know,
I just need to buy some time.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.400
I know,
I just need to buy some time.

17:14.440 --> 17:16.840
OK, I'll cover for you with Dominic,
but...

17:16.880 --> 17:19.200
Nadya's bound to notice,
she's been all over this.

17:20.560 --> 17:23.720
Then you'd better make it look good.
I will.

18:00.280 --> 18:02.760
Carolina.

18:02.800 --> 18:04.480
Hey.

18:05.680 --> 18:07.520
How are you feeling?

18:07.560 --> 18:08.000
Last I heard you were in hospital.
I'm good, thank you.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.600
Last I heard you were in hospital.
I'm good, thank you.

18:10.640 --> 18:13.120
Can we speak? Thank you.

18:13.160 --> 18:16.000
We need to talk about Dominic.
What about him?

18:16.000 --> 18:16.360
We need to talk about Dominic.
What about him?

18:16.400 --> 18:18.640
I knew he was spying on NYL.

18:19.560 --> 18:22.480
But I didn't know
he might be involved in two murders.

18:24.280 --> 18:27.000
I don't think so. Are you
willing to bet your own money

18:27.040 --> 18:28.400
and your good name on that?

18:28.440 --> 18:30.720
So you're going to stab him
in the back, huh?

18:30.760 --> 18:32.000
You know, Massimo, pretty soon
you're going to be unemployable.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.280
You know, Massimo, pretty soon
you're going to be unemployable.

18:34.320 --> 18:37.080
Losing my job, it would be
the least of my problems.

18:37.120 --> 18:40.000
Listen, Dominic's a dangerous man
to cross, I'll grant you that.

18:40.000 --> 18:40.840
Listen, Dominic's a dangerous man
to cross, I'll grant you that.

18:40.880 --> 18:43.480
You don't know Dominic like I do.
You think?

18:45.480 --> 18:47.240
Last year we were in Milan.

18:48.240 --> 18:50.640
It was Globe Fair.

18:51.600 --> 18:54.200
You can only marvel
so many times at big screens

18:54.240 --> 18:56.000
proclaiming the glories
of Turkmenistan's textile industry,

18:56.000 --> 18:57.600
proclaiming the glories
of Turkmenistan's textile industry,

18:57.640 --> 18:59.760
before your mind
turns to other things.

19:04.800 --> 19:08.520
Premier Li Keqiang announced
the "Made in China 2025" strategy.

19:09.480 --> 19:12.000
Dominic immediately grasped
the implications.

19:12.000 --> 19:12.560
Dominic immediately grasped
the implications.

19:13.520 --> 19:15.320
Stonehouse didn't.

19:15.360 --> 19:17.480
What do you think, Jeremy?

19:17.520 --> 19:20.000
I think China moving up in the world
can only be a good thing.

19:20.040 --> 19:22.160
They wanna do more
than just move up.

19:22.200 --> 19:23.760
They wanna dominate.

19:23.800 --> 19:25.840
It's a declaration of war.

19:25.880 --> 19:28.000
Our alliance with China
has benefitted both sides.

19:28.000 --> 19:28.880
Our alliance with China
has benefitted both sides.

19:28.920 --> 19:31.800
You mean you're making too much
money off cheap imports to care.

19:31.840 --> 19:33.960
It's a short-term view, Jeremy.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
There are shifts in power
in any relationship.

19:36.000 --> 19:36.040
There are shifts in power
in any relationship.

19:36.080 --> 19:39.000
You had no problem with those
imports when you were at NYL.

19:39.040 --> 19:41.320
This isn't about just making money.

19:41.360 --> 19:44.000
We've created a monster, one
that's intent on eating its maker.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.400
We've created a monster, one
that's intent on eating its maker.

19:46.440 --> 19:49.720
I don't agree. Maybe somebody
on the 13th floor might.

19:51.200 --> 19:52.000
Dominic, I know it's been hard
for you being in exile.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.840
Dominic, I know it's been hard
for you being in exile.

19:53.880 --> 19:56.840
I understand that you're looking
for a way back in from the cold.

19:56.880 --> 19:58.880
But this isn't it.

19:59.680 --> 20:00.000
In fact, there is no way back in.
Not for you, not ever.

20:00.000 --> 20:03.360
In fact, there is no way back in.
Not for you, not ever.

20:07.560 --> 20:08.000
Stonehouse made the one mistake
you must never make with Dominic.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.960
Stonehouse made the one mistake
you must never make with Dominic.

20:11.000 --> 20:14.120
Carolina.
Jeremy.

20:14.160 --> 20:16.000
He underestimated him.

20:16.000 --> 20:16.160
He underestimated him.

20:18.720 --> 20:24.000
Dominic will fight for survival.
He can't afford to lose this war.

20:24.000 --> 20:24.080
Dominic will fight for survival.
He can't afford to lose this war.

20:24.120 --> 20:26.680
"He's a dangerous man to cross".

20:27.800 --> 20:30.520
Your words, not mine.

20:44.240 --> 20:47.080
Good evening, Mr Morgan.
Good night.

20:51.440 --> 20:55.280
You never stop, do you?
I have a lot to learn.

20:55.320 --> 20:56.000
You'll go far, Nadya.

20:56.000 --> 20:56.800
You'll go far, Nadya.

21:01.560 --> 21:02.800
Don't stay too late.

21:54.360 --> 21:56.640
Hey.
Hey.

21:57.880 --> 21:59.360
Thanks for coming.

22:05.840 --> 22:08.000
It's good to see you.
You too.

22:08.000 --> 22:08.440
It's good to see you.
You too.

22:09.800 --> 22:12.600
I'm surprised you agreed to come,
after last time.

22:16.040 --> 22:18.040
A whiskey, please.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.920
You...You came to the hospital.

22:23.960 --> 22:24.000
I did.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.480
I did.

22:25.520 --> 22:27.160
Thank you.

22:31.280 --> 22:32.000
I'm so sorry about last time.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.040
I'm so sorry about last time.

22:34.080 --> 22:37.160
It's OK.
No, I was...angry.

22:37.200 --> 22:39.920
You had every right to be.

22:39.960 --> 22:40.000
Let's leave it in the past,
everything, OK?

22:40.000 --> 22:42.640
Let's leave it in the past,
everything, OK?

22:49.720 --> 22:51.760
So, I wanted to tell you something.

22:56.760 --> 22:59.080
I'm pregnant.

23:06.080 --> 23:09.680
Say something.
Oh...I don't know what to say.

23:10.480 --> 23:12.000
I'm not asking anything from you,
but I just thought you should know.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.040
I'm not asking anything from you,
but I just thought you should know.

23:15.200 --> 23:17.240
Hm. Of course. Of course.

23:23.080 --> 23:25.720
Now what...
I don't know.

23:25.760 --> 23:28.000
I...
I just never saw myself as a mother.

23:28.000 --> 23:29.080
I...
I just never saw myself as a mother.

23:39.800 --> 23:41.320
Zhi.
Yeah.

23:43.120 --> 23:44.000
When I got hit by that car...

23:44.000 --> 23:45.760
When I got hit by that car...

23:47.360 --> 23:50.560
I was being chased by two men.
What?

23:54.400 --> 23:56.640
If anyone found out
about the pregnancy...

23:58.560 --> 24:00.000
you could be dragged into it, too.

24:00.000 --> 24:00.880
you could be dragged into it, too.

24:28.120 --> 24:30.520
Hi.

24:30.560 --> 24:32.000
Tia Widholm,
this is Massimo Ruggero, our CEO.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.520
Tia Widholm,
this is Massimo Ruggero, our CEO.

24:33.560 --> 24:38.280
Nice to meet you. Tia is
FramTek's Chief Technology Officer.

24:38.320 --> 24:39.920
Will Mr Morgan
be joining us as well?

24:39.960 --> 24:40.000
No, I believe
he signed the NDA we sent over.

24:40.000 --> 24:43.200
No, I believe
he signed the NDA we sent over.

24:43.240 --> 24:47.200
Yes, of course. We're all
very excited about this opportunity.

24:49.200 --> 24:52.120
You already know
our platform is Open RAN,

24:52.160 --> 24:56.000
allowing for a public 5G highway
controlled entirely by the user.

24:56.000 --> 24:56.200
allowing for a public 5G highway
controlled entirely by the user.

24:56.240 --> 24:58.880
The bedrock of our approach
at FramTek is privacy.

24:58.920 --> 25:02.400
We have a shared vision for what
we call "democratic technology".

25:02.440 --> 25:04.000
Global access and safety for all,
but not just for us now,

25:04.000 --> 25:05.480
Global access and safety for all,
but not just for us now,

25:05.520 --> 25:09.200
but for the future of our children
and their children.

25:10.960 --> 25:12.000
And you can deliver
what you're promising? We must.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.920
And you can deliver
what you're promising? We must.

25:14.960 --> 25:17.520
For the future of the free world.

25:19.240 --> 25:20.000
Which is why, as much
as I appreciate your interest,

25:20.000 --> 25:22.120
Which is why, as much
as I appreciate your interest,

25:22.160 --> 25:25.040
there's no way in hell
we'd sell to Dominic Morgan.

25:26.320 --> 25:28.000
Let's just say we doubt very much
he shares our vision.

25:28.000 --> 25:28.800
Let's just say we doubt very much
he shares our vision.

25:28.840 --> 25:32.960
No, he doesn't, Ms Widholm,
but we do.

25:36.960 --> 25:40.080
Take your hands off me! I'm leaving!

25:43.440 --> 25:44.000
Are you the one that did this?

25:44.000 --> 25:46.200
Are you the one that did this?

25:47.840 --> 25:51.040
Or was it your master, Cheng?
Do I know you?

25:51.080 --> 25:52.000
My parents' business
has been ruined,

25:52.000 --> 25:52.920
My parents' business
has been ruined,

25:52.960 --> 25:54.840
contracts cancelled, assets frozen.

25:54.880 --> 25:56.960
My little sister here in London
is to be deported

25:57.000 --> 25:59.040
to a country she's never known.

25:59.080 --> 26:00.000
I'm really sorry,
but I don't understand

26:00.000 --> 26:01.560
I'm really sorry,
but I don't understand

26:01.600 --> 26:03.960
what any of this has to do
with our bank, Mister...

26:04.000 --> 26:05.840
Carl Wong.

26:05.880 --> 26:08.000
Ask your boyfriend.
My boyfriend?

26:08.000 --> 26:08.040
Ask your boyfriend.
My boyfriend?

26:08.080 --> 26:09.760
Ask Massimo.

26:09.800 --> 26:11.960
Sir, please.
I'm leaving.

26:24.200 --> 26:28.520
She visited Massimo three times
in hospital, that we know about.

26:28.560 --> 26:32.000
And then met him again last night.
About?

26:32.000 --> 26:32.800
And then met him again last night.
About?

26:33.680 --> 26:35.960
That we don't know.

26:36.960 --> 26:40.000
Sorry, should I come back later?
No, no, it's fine.

26:40.000 --> 26:40.120
Sorry, should I come back later?
No, no, it's fine.

26:40.160 --> 26:41.640
I was just leaving.

26:45.560 --> 26:48.000
How are the 5G prospects
coming along? Good.

26:48.000 --> 26:48.080
How are the 5G prospects
coming along? Good.

26:48.120 --> 26:51.080
Yeah, we've identified
an interesting company.

26:51.120 --> 26:53.560
FramTek, out of Sweden.

26:56.080 --> 26:58.040
Open RAN.
Yeah.

26:58.080 --> 27:00.560
As we discussed,
we're modelling it both ways.

27:00.600 --> 27:03.520
Does Zhi know about this?
Not yet.

27:05.440 --> 27:09.760
I want to invite you to dinner
Monday night. Bring your wife.

27:09.800 --> 27:12.000
We've been keeping you from her.
We would love that.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.240
We've been keeping you from her.
We would love that.

27:13.280 --> 27:14.680
Great.

27:14.720 --> 27:16.080
Please, have a seat.

27:24.000 --> 27:25.800
How is Zhi doing?

27:26.840 --> 27:28.000
Fine.
She seems distracted to me.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.160
Fine.
She seems distracted to me.

27:30.200 --> 27:33.440
I thought perhaps
you could offer some insight.

27:41.280 --> 27:43.440
Wait! Uh-oh!

27:43.480 --> 27:44.000
I don't know how you do it.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.120
I don't know how you do it.

27:45.160 --> 27:48.560
Juggle work and two young children
so effortlessly.

27:48.600 --> 27:50.440
Oh, trust me, it takes effort.

27:50.480 --> 27:52.000
This is the face
of a woman on the edge.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.960
This is the face
of a woman on the edge.

27:54.000 --> 27:55.840
Here you go.
Is it that hard?

27:57.680 --> 28:00.000
It is, but it's worth it.

28:00.000 --> 28:00.400
It is, but it's worth it.

28:00.440 --> 28:05.440
You know, the anxiety,
the energy, the effort.

28:06.320 --> 28:08.000
You know, being a Mum has taught me

28:08.000 --> 28:08.440
You know, being a Mum has taught me

28:08.480 --> 28:10.800
so much about
what love really means.

28:10.840 --> 28:13.680
It's the best thing I've ever done,
or ever will do.

28:16.760 --> 28:19.240
Oliver, could you get the gate
for me, please?

28:20.400 --> 28:22.640
Don't worry, I'll finish it.
Thank you.

28:30.880 --> 28:32.000
Er... Am I interrupting?
Oliver forgot to invite you.

28:32.000 --> 28:35.000
Er... Am I interrupting?
Oliver forgot to invite you.

28:35.040 --> 28:36.680
I'm going to kill him.

28:36.720 --> 28:39.920
I shouldn't have turned up like
this. No, of course you're invited.

28:39.960 --> 28:40.000
It's your godson's birthday!
It's OK.

28:40.000 --> 28:41.840
It's your godson's birthday!
It's OK.

28:41.880 --> 28:44.720
No, please, for me.
All right.

28:45.760 --> 28:47.840
Thank you. Come on.

28:48.840 --> 28:50.840
After me.

28:54.560 --> 28:55.760
Hey.

28:58.360 --> 29:00.360
All right.

29:05.560 --> 29:08.000
I didn't think you'd wanna come.
Don't worry.

29:10.800 --> 29:12.000
How are you?
Good.

29:12.000 --> 29:12.480
How are you?
Good.

29:13.680 --> 29:16.080
The other night,
after I came to your house,

29:16.120 --> 29:17.600
someone broke into my car.

29:19.840 --> 29:20.000
Daddy!

29:20.000 --> 29:20.920
Daddy!

29:20.960 --> 29:24.040
How are you?
Hey, one sec.

29:24.080 --> 29:26.160
Did they take anything?
No.

29:27.600 --> 29:28.000
What aren't you telling me, Massimo?

29:28.000 --> 29:29.440
What aren't you telling me, Massimo?

29:33.960 --> 29:35.720
Hey. Awww!

29:42.200 --> 29:44.000
Hey, you, superhero! Happy birthday.

29:44.000 --> 29:44.640
Hey, you, superhero! Happy birthday.

29:51.240 --> 29:52.000
How are you?

29:52.000 --> 29:53.480
How are you?

29:53.520 --> 29:56.400
I'm good, you?
Good.

29:57.360 --> 30:00.000
Listen,
do you know a man named Carl Wong?

30:00.000 --> 30:00.800
Listen,
do you know a man named Carl Wong?

30:02.520 --> 30:06.520
Yes, why?
He was at NYL yesterday.

30:06.560 --> 30:08.000
He said that China's punishing
his family for something he did.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.480
He said that China's punishing
his family for something he did.

30:10.520 --> 30:15.040
Is he all right?
No, he didn't seem all right.

30:15.080 --> 30:16.000
I'll speak to him.
Thank you for letting me know.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.800
I'll speak to him.
Thank you for letting me know.

30:18.840 --> 30:21.600
Yeah.
OK.

30:22.760 --> 30:24.000
Do you...
No, go ahead. OK.

30:24.000 --> 30:24.760
Do you...
No, go ahead. OK.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.560
Good morning.
Thank you all for coming.

30:44.600 --> 30:46.640
Do you mind if Nadya joins us?

30:49.720 --> 30:51.360
Not at all.

30:51.400 --> 30:53.000
Carry on.

30:56.120 --> 30:59.000
I'd like to present
our initial 5G targets.

30:59.040 --> 31:01.040
If you'll turn to page one...

31:01.920 --> 31:04.000
These five companies offer
a solid growth trajectory,

31:04.000 --> 31:06.240
These five companies offer
a solid growth trajectory,

31:06.280 --> 31:08.840
and a healthy spread
of holdings across Europe.

31:08.880 --> 31:11.040
I have a question.

31:12.400 --> 31:15.280
Please.
The Swedish company, FramTek...

31:15.320 --> 31:17.560
It isn't here, why not?

31:19.720 --> 31:20.000
FramTek's an interesting prospect.
We're looking at it.

31:20.000 --> 31:23.720
FramTek's an interesting prospect.
We're looking at it.

31:23.760 --> 31:26.600
"Interesting"
doesn't quite describe it.

31:27.480 --> 31:28.000
If FramTek succeeds, then Open RAN
could totally disrupt the 5G market.

31:28.000 --> 31:31.200
If FramTek succeeds, then Open RAN
could totally disrupt the 5G market.

31:33.360 --> 31:36.000
We are not looking for disruption.
We're looking for scale, synergy.

31:36.000 --> 31:37.680
We are not looking for disruption.
We're looking for scale, synergy.

31:39.800 --> 31:44.000
So we acquire it to shut it down,
get rid of a potential threat.

31:44.000 --> 31:44.320
So we acquire it to shut it down,
get rid of a potential threat.

31:44.360 --> 31:46.200
That's a good point.
Perhaps we will.

31:48.600 --> 31:50.960
Any other question?
Yes...

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
But I'd like to know
what we're going to be doing

31:52.000 --> 31:53.240
But I'd like to know
what we're going to be doing

31:53.280 --> 31:55.120
about data protection.

31:55.160 --> 31:57.520
Now this is absolutely...

31:57.560 --> 31:59.720
Thank you very much.
You're welcome.

31:59.760 --> 32:00.000
Thank you. Thank you.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.760
Thank you. Thank you.

32:03.680 --> 32:05.480
That seemed to go well.
Thank you.

32:05.520 --> 32:07.800
Except for FramTek.

32:07.840 --> 32:08.000
As I said,
it's not a great moment...

32:08.000 --> 32:10.360
As I said,
it's not a great moment...

32:10.400 --> 32:12.840
I understand
you had a meeting with Tia Widholm.

32:15.600 --> 32:16.000
Yes,
we've met with several companies.

32:16.000 --> 32:19.040
Yes,
we've met with several companies.

32:19.080 --> 32:23.200
Rebecca's right.
Acquire them and shut them down.

32:30.040 --> 32:32.000
You didn't see FramTek?

32:32.000 --> 32:32.040
You didn't see FramTek?

32:39.800 --> 32:40.000
You did see FramTek.

32:40.000 --> 32:41.280
You did see FramTek.

32:43.320 --> 32:47.280
Speak up next time.
That's why you're here.

32:53.040 --> 32:54.760
Here you go.

32:54.800 --> 32:56.000
Everything looks normal.
Thank you.

32:56.000 --> 32:56.960
Everything looks normal.
Thank you.

32:58.040 --> 33:00.560
We'll check the structures
at the next scan.

33:00.600 --> 33:02.840
If you like, we can see
if we can make out the sex.

33:07.280 --> 33:11.600
I know last time you were...
considering your options.

33:12.520 --> 33:14.480
How are you feeling
about things now?

33:17.600 --> 33:20.000
You don't have to make
a decision just yet.

33:24.920 --> 33:26.920
I've made my decision.

33:33.440 --> 33:36.000
I'm glad you were able to join us,
Mrs Harris. Latoyah, please.

33:36.000 --> 33:36.800
I'm glad you were able to join us,
Mrs Harris. Latoyah, please.

33:36.840 --> 33:40.680
We keep Oliver away from you enough,
so this is the least we can do.

33:41.520 --> 33:44.000
You both work very hard.
And have two young children.

33:44.000 --> 33:44.440
You both work very hard.
And have two young children.

33:44.480 --> 33:47.040
Yeah. Yeah, well,
we don't get much time together,

33:47.080 --> 33:49.240
but we're very fortunate.

33:49.280 --> 33:51.640
Yeah, we are.

33:54.560 --> 33:57.160
But I confess
I have an ulterior motive.

33:57.200 --> 34:00.000
We need to ask Oliver something

34:00.000 --> 34:00.120
We need to ask Oliver something

34:00.160 --> 34:04.040
that might demand
a little more of your precious time.

34:06.400 --> 34:08.000
We wondered if you're interested
in serving as Head of Trading.

34:08.000 --> 34:09.880
We wondered if you're interested
in serving as Head of Trading.

34:12.320 --> 34:15.640
But I've just been made
Chief Strategy Officer,

34:15.680 --> 34:16.000
and Zhi is...
Is pregnant.

34:16.000 --> 34:17.640
and Zhi is...
Is pregnant.

34:17.680 --> 34:22.720
You would be the second-youngest
Head of Trading NYL has ever had.

34:22.760 --> 34:24.000
After Massimo.
Are you interested?

34:24.000 --> 34:26.080
After Massimo.
Are you interested?

34:26.120 --> 34:29.160
Yeah. I'm just surprised.

34:32.080 --> 34:34.400
Latoyah?

34:34.440 --> 34:37.200
This isn't
because Zhi's pregnant, is it?

34:37.240 --> 34:39.840
You do know that women
can work and be mothers.

34:39.880 --> 34:40.000
Of course.

34:40.000 --> 34:41.960
Of course.

34:42.000 --> 34:45.160
No, we have...
a different path in mind for Zhi.

34:47.360 --> 34:48.000
Now, we chose Oliver because
we think he's ready for the job.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.680
Now, we chose Oliver because
we think he's ready for the job.

34:52.040 --> 34:54.560
I will eat to that.

35:05.520 --> 35:09.680
Your wife didn't seem pleased.
No, she is.

35:09.720 --> 35:12.000
And look, I'm very grateful
for this opportunity.

35:12.000 --> 35:12.880
And look, I'm very grateful
for this opportunity.

35:12.920 --> 35:14.360
Thank you.

35:14.400 --> 35:16.760
I didn't want
to say it at the table, but...

35:16.800 --> 35:19.640
there's something
you need to do for me first.

35:19.680 --> 35:20.000
What's that?

35:20.000 --> 35:21.560
What's that?

35:23.960 --> 35:25.360
We'll discuss it tomorrow.

35:26.320 --> 35:28.000
Shall we?

35:28.000 --> 35:28.840
Shall we?

35:39.200 --> 35:41.600
What was that about?

35:41.640 --> 35:44.000
You don't side-line a woman
just because she's pregnant.

35:44.000 --> 35:44.720
You don't side-line a woman
just because she's pregnant.

35:44.760 --> 35:47.400
And you thought tonight was the time
to put the world straight?

35:47.440 --> 35:51.160
With my promotion on the line?
I'm worried about you.

35:51.200 --> 35:52.000
Where's that come from?

35:52.000 --> 35:53.560
Where's that come from?

35:53.600 --> 35:56.000
You stole private data
from my computer.

35:56.040 --> 35:58.560
You lied about being home
for the kids. Who told you that?

35:58.600 --> 36:00.000
Are you denying it?

36:00.000 --> 36:00.600
Are you denying it?

36:01.800 --> 36:03.560
And you told Liwei
about Zhi's pregnancy,

36:03.600 --> 36:05.480
after you promised me
that you wouldn't.

36:06.520 --> 36:08.000
I didn't tell Liwei.
Enough lies, Oliver.

36:08.000 --> 36:08.840
I didn't tell Liwei.
Enough lies, Oliver.

36:12.480 --> 36:14.480
I don't know who you are any more.

36:14.520 --> 36:16.000
I'm the same man I've always been.

36:16.000 --> 36:16.520
I'm the same man I've always been.

36:17.400 --> 36:20.600
Then maybe you were never the man
I thought you were.

36:43.720 --> 36:45.800
Hey.
Hey.

36:45.840 --> 36:48.000
Hi. Do... Do you...

36:48.040 --> 36:49.840
I can come in?
Yeah, sure, come in.

36:56.720 --> 36:59.280
Drink?
Milk.

36:59.320 --> 37:01.320
Milk... Er...

37:07.040 --> 37:08.320
For you.

37:14.600 --> 37:17.080
That's disgusting.

37:17.120 --> 37:19.320
What is it?
I don't know.

37:20.600 --> 37:24.200
Oat milk.
You really shouldn't drink that.

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
OK.

37:27.920 --> 37:28.000
So...

37:28.000 --> 37:30.720
So...

37:30.760 --> 37:32.960
Why are you here?

37:48.600 --> 37:50.600
Where did you get this?

37:50.640 --> 37:52.000
The hospital.

37:52.000 --> 37:52.640
The hospital.

37:53.680 --> 37:57.000
And now you're giving it back. Why?

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
I heard them arguing
after your accident.

38:00.000 --> 38:00.320
I heard them arguing
after your accident.

38:00.360 --> 38:03.920
You have to get it back. Now.

38:03.960 --> 38:06.960
You expect me to go
into the ICU and take it?

38:07.000 --> 38:08.000
You do whatever it takes, Dominic.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.320
You do whatever it takes, Dominic.

38:10.360 --> 38:14.880
If I go down...
you go down with me.

38:14.920 --> 38:16.000
Go down with me.

38:16.000 --> 38:16.920
Go down with me.

38:16.960 --> 38:19.000
I never trusted her.

38:19.040 --> 38:21.200
I'm certain Dominic doesn't either.

38:22.240 --> 38:24.000
But he needed her money
in the beginning.

38:24.000 --> 38:25.200
But he needed her money
in the beginning.

38:25.240 --> 38:26.920
Now he can't get rid of her.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.040
Why are you doing this?

38:32.280 --> 38:34.720
I think you're trying to do
the right thing.

38:36.800 --> 38:40.000
You let Nakamoto get away,
didn't you?

38:40.000 --> 38:40.160
You let Nakamoto get away,
didn't you?

38:40.200 --> 38:43.280
You lied about FramTek
to keep them from buying it.

38:47.760 --> 38:48.000
What?

38:48.000 --> 38:49.440
What?

38:49.480 --> 38:53.360
You're even more clever
than I thought you were.

38:54.920 --> 38:56.000
Thank you.

38:56.000 --> 38:56.920
Thank you.

38:58.960 --> 39:00.960
Nadya.

39:05.840 --> 39:07.600
I know you care about Dominic.

39:08.480 --> 39:10.480
He will find out.

39:12.840 --> 39:14.840
I'll be gone by then.

39:19.320 --> 39:20.000
Goodbye.
Goodbye.

39:20.000 --> 39:20.800
Goodbye.
Goodbye.

39:26.800 --> 39:28.000
How did you get this?
It's complicated.

39:28.000 --> 39:29.760
How did you get this?
It's complicated.

39:29.800 --> 39:32.040
Can you tell me what's on it?
Of course.

39:43.960 --> 39:44.000
It's Damian's predictions on Brexit.

39:44.000 --> 39:46.840
It's Damian's predictions on Brexit.

39:48.040 --> 39:49.960
He was right.
He said it would be Remain.

39:53.440 --> 39:55.640
It would've been.
What is it?

39:58.200 --> 40:00.000
This shows
someone accessed his data,

40:00.000 --> 40:00.400
This shows
someone accessed his data,

40:00.440 --> 40:06.000
profiling undecided voters
in 12 key counties...

40:07.080 --> 40:08.000
Targeting with social media
misinformation for 48 hours

40:08.000 --> 40:10.480
Targeting with social media
misinformation for 48 hours

40:10.520 --> 40:11.960
leading up to the referendum.

40:12.000 --> 40:15.440
They used Damian's data to change
the outcome of the election.

40:15.480 --> 40:16.000
But why?

40:16.000 --> 40:16.520
But why?

40:16.560 --> 40:19.000
You, the British people,
will decide.

40:19.040 --> 40:21.200
A victory for real people!

40:21.240 --> 40:24.000
For ordinary people!
For decent people!

40:24.000 --> 40:24.400
For ordinary people!
For decent people!

40:26.560 --> 40:29.120
To make
hundreds of millions of pounds.

40:30.520 --> 40:32.000
Can you make a copy of this?

40:32.000 --> 40:32.160
Can you make a copy of this?

40:32.200 --> 40:36.760
I'll upload it to cloud,
that way it can't be erased.

40:40.920 --> 40:42.120
Thank you.

40:50.840 --> 40:52.520
Hey.

40:56.320 --> 40:57.880
What are you doing here?

40:59.520 --> 41:03.760
I need your help. But I thought
you said it was dangerous.

41:04.560 --> 41:06.560
I know.

41:08.680 --> 41:10.440
Come.

41:12.880 --> 41:15.760
"They will soon
be calling me Mr Brexit",

41:15.800 --> 41:18.000
tweeted Donald Trump on Thursday.

41:18.040 --> 41:20.000
And no one was sure
quite what to make of it.

41:20.000 --> 41:21.120
And no one was sure
quite what to make of it.

41:21.160 --> 41:24.480
We have been alarmed
by the comments he made

41:24.520 --> 41:26.520
during his election campaign.

41:40.640 --> 41:44.000
What do you want?
Good evening to you, too.

41:44.000 --> 41:44.200
What do you want?
Good evening to you, too.

41:44.240 --> 41:45.880
Well?

41:45.920 --> 41:47.600
You will secure my early release,

41:47.640 --> 41:50.360
getting my sentence commuted
to time served.

41:50.400 --> 41:52.000
Even if I could do that,
why on earth would I?

41:52.000 --> 41:53.320
Even if I could do that,
why on earth would I?

41:53.360 --> 41:55.880
Because with a little
gentle persuasion,

41:55.920 --> 41:58.360
I've acquired
what you've been looking for.

42:03.280 --> 42:06.160
Where from?
You mean you don't know that?

42:41.760 --> 42:45.120
Trump! Trump! Trump!

42:45.160 --> 42:47.840
We're getting screwed by every
foreign country in the world.

42:47.880 --> 42:48.000
We have been for years.

42:48.000 --> 42:49.800
We have been for years.

42:49.840 --> 42:53.560
To be honest, we are
sick and tired of politicians.

42:53.600 --> 42:56.000
I think he's three steps ahead
of everybody I've seen.

42:56.000 --> 42:56.960
I think he's three steps ahead
of everybody I've seen.

42:57.000 --> 42:59.560
He's a chess player,
everybody else is playing checkers.

42:59.600 --> 43:01.800
It's overwhelming, OK?

43:01.840 --> 43:04.000
"Overwhelming"
for lack of a better word.

43:04.000 --> 43:05.360
"Overwhelming"
for lack of a better word.
