Diaz's base of operations is too secure,

00:21.688 --> 00:24.021

without losing people.

Everyone has immunity
from prosecution, Rene.

The FBI recognizes that Diaz
is the clear and present danger.

we were moving in on him tonight?

03:05.602 --> 03:06.809
We rounded up the SCPD,

03:06.895 --> 03:09.103
but Diaz still controls
dozens of city officials.

03:09.189 --> 03:11.556
Diaz has a list of all of them.
He keeps it on his person.

03:11.650 --> 03:13.266
Once we take Diaz, we won't need a list.

03:13.360 --> 03:14.976
We need to interrogate
all the people we rounded up

03:15.070 --> 03:17.357
and see if we can get one of them
to give up Diaz's location.

03:17.447 --> 03:18.654
No, they won't give it up.

03:18.865 --> 03:20.572
They're more afraid of him
than they are of us.

03:20.659 --> 03:23.402
They also know, without corroboration,
Diaz, or this list of his,

How many did I get?</i>

12:40.843 --> 12:42.084
(SPEAKING RUSSIAN)

12:42.178 --> 12:45.387
You betray me,
and I'm the son of a bitch?

12:45.556 --> 12:48.173
<i>The ones trapped in there
with those explosives,</i>

12:48.268 --> 12:49.975
they're gonna die in a blink.

12:50.228 --> 12:51.719
<i>But you, Anatoly...</i>

12:51.813 --> 12:52.803
(SPEAKING RUSSIAN)

12:54.774 --> 12:57.562
(IN ENGLISH) I'm gonna make it last
for days with you.

12:58.820 --> 12:59.810
(BEEPING)

12:59.904 --> 13:02.066
He triggered the explosives,
but I'm bouncing the signal off

13:02.156 --> 13:04.193
a bunch of satellites.
You have seven seconds.

13:04.284 --> 13:05.616
Move!

13:06.494 --> 13:07.484
(EXPLOSION)

13:14.627 --> 13:16.038
Come on!

13:35.523 --> 13:36.639
You okay?

13:48.661 --> 13:50.323
Thought I'd check in on you.

13:51.289 --> 13:52.496
I'm fine, hoss.

13:54.083 --> 13:56.541
Agent Watson told me about
your call with Zoe.

13:58.087 --> 13:59.703
I thought I was gonna die in that room.

14:02.425 --> 14:04.337
I just wanted to say goodbye.

14:04.635 --> 14:06.217
Tell her how proud you are of her?

14:06.304 --> 14:08.341
There's not enough words
to say how much.

14:11.893 --> 14:13.509
I feel the same way about you, Rene.

14:16.147 --> 14:18.264
When I first met you, I... (CHUCKLES)

14:18.441 --> 14:22.856
I didn't think you were much more
than a thug...

14:23.696 --> 14:24.903
(CHUCKLES)

14:24.989 --> 14:26.446
...in a ridiculous costume.

14:27.575 --> 14:29.157
No prize yourself, hoss.

14:31.788 --> 14:32.995
I judged you.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.866
For far too long, I judged you,

14:38.336 --> 14:39.827
and that was a mistake.

14:41.589 --> 14:42.921
I'm sorry.

14:44.842 --> 14:47.084
I think that you're a good man, Rene.

14:48.638 --> 14:51.005
I think that you're the type of man
that this...

14:52.183 --> 14:53.890
This city deserves.

14:54.936 --> 14:57.804
I know it seems like I don't give
a crap about what anyone thinks,

14:59.482 --> 15:00.973
but this means a lot.

15:02.193 --> 15:03.309
Yeah.

15:07.865 --> 15:11.108
Guys, we have another problem.

15:13.037 --> 15:16.405
I told Diaz to go to hell because
you were about to move on him.

15:16.499 --> 15:17.865
ANATOLY: It was deception.

15:17.959 --> 15:20.042
He learned I was helping you,
and he manipulated me.

15:20.336 --> 15:21.872
JOHN: It means
we're right back to square one,

15:21.963 --> 15:23.374
not knowing where Diaz is.

15:23.840 --> 15:25.456
But now we have a way to find out.

15:26.634 --> 15:29.923
You tell Diaz you wanna see Laurel.
Proof of life.

15:30.012 --> 15:31.628
We follow you to her, her to Diaz.

15:31.722 --> 15:34.180
You go in there guns blazing,
my daughter takes the first bullet.

15:34.267 --> 15:36.884
From what Oliver tells me,
she's not actually your daughter.

15:36.978 --> 15:38.685
And she's a criminal
that made her own bed.

15:39.522 --> 15:42.265
This isn't a hostage situation.
Our objective hasn't changed.

15:42.692 --> 15:44.604
- Oliver, please...
- We can keep her safe.

15:44.694 --> 15:47.107
How? The first thing he'll do
when he sees you coming is kill her.

15:47.196 --> 15:48.812
I think this is a risk we need to take.

15:48.948 --> 15:52.817
Yeah? Would you be taking that risk
if this was our Laurel?

15:52.910 --> 15:54.492
Or is that the kind of risk
that got her killed

15:54.579 --> 15:55.740
in the first damn place?

16:00.710 --> 16:01.996
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

16:04.464 --> 16:05.921
What the hell do you want?

16:06.007 --> 16:07.669
To give you a second chance.

16:07.842 --> 16:12.758
When you told me to go to hell,
you know, I figured that you figured

16:12.847 --> 16:15.555
your buddies were about to take me down.

16:16.017 --> 16:17.553
Well, it didn't work out that way.

16:17.935 --> 16:19.722
<i>So now we're back to where we started.</i>

16:20.021 --> 16:23.230
You kicking the FBI out of here
in exchange for Laurel's life.

16:24.942 --> 16:27.309
I need to see her first, proof of life.

16:27.403 --> 16:28.985
<i>I'll send you the address.</i>

16:29.155 --> 16:31.442
Listen, you better come alone

16:32.533 --> 16:34.741
'cause if something happens
that I don't like,

16:36.162 --> 16:38.654
something's gonna happen to Laurel
that you don't like.

16:47.924 --> 16:50.507
Anyone ever tell you it's rude
to sneak up on people?

16:58.100 --> 16:59.466
Diaz?

17:01.145 --> 17:03.853
- He's gonna kill her.
- I won't let that happen, Quentin.

17:03.940 --> 17:05.226
(SIGHS)

17:05.316 --> 17:06.772
What about Watson, huh?

17:07.068 --> 17:08.650
She doesn't seem so important to her.

17:08.736 --> 17:10.693
Just let me worry about Samanda Watson,

17:10.780 --> 17:14.114
and let me try to keep Laurel safe.

17:14.200 --> 17:15.816
I don't see how you can, Oliver.

17:16.077 --> 17:17.784
You can start by trusting me.

17:18.788 --> 17:19.949
Please.

17:21.582 --> 17:22.823
I mean, I've earned it.

17:22.916 --> 17:25.329
We've known each other
for a very long time, Quentin.

17:25.419 --> 17:26.535
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

17:27.338 --> 17:29.455
- A lifetime.
- Yeah.

17:30.758 --> 17:32.124
We've come a long way, you and me.

17:32.468 --> 17:35.381
It's been getting better since
the first time you arrested me.

17:36.681 --> 17:38.388
You know, I've always been curious.

17:38.891 --> 17:41.008
How did you beat
that lie detector anyway?

17:41.269 --> 17:43.386
It just comes down

17:45.022 --> 17:46.513
to keeping a regular heart rate.

17:46.774 --> 17:48.310
I had a pacemaker that does that.

17:48.401 --> 17:49.767
I didn't know you had a pacemaker.

17:49.860 --> 17:52.477
I got it after that Mirakuru business
a few years back.

17:52.572 --> 17:54.484
The old ticker couldn't
take that pounding. (LAUGHS)

17:54.574 --> 17:55.815
Yeah.

17:56.617 --> 17:58.734
Truth be told, I don't know
if it could take it now.

17:59.203 --> 18:01.946
Yes, it can. Okay?
Because you're tough.

18:02.456 --> 18:04.243
Laurel is tough too.

18:04.917 --> 18:06.874
So trust me,

18:09.797 --> 18:11.459
and this will all work out.

18:37.408 --> 18:38.649
QUENTIN: You're supposed to
bring Laurel.

18:38.743 --> 18:40.029
I give the orders.

18:40.536 --> 18:41.526
HENCHMAN: He's clean.

18:41.621 --> 18:43.533
You're gonna give an order as Mayor

18:43.623 --> 18:45.455
to get the FBI out of here.

18:46.083 --> 18:47.870
<i>And you're gonna do it
at a press conference.</i>

18:48.419 --> 18:50.832
Satellite track is clean.
Audio signal is five by five.

18:50.921 --> 18:52.128
Everyone get ready to move.

18:52.214 --> 18:54.331
Not going anywhere until
we know where he's keeping Laurel.

18:54.425 --> 18:55.836
Not our objective.

18:55.926 --> 18:57.633
QUENTIN: <i>You want me
to hold a press conference</i>

18:57.720 --> 18:59.712
before you even let me see my daughter?

19:00.014 --> 19:01.425
Do you have a problem with that?

19:02.224 --> 19:04.216
I'm not doing anything
until I see her alive.

19:04.644 --> 19:05.805
What the hell is he doing?

19:07.563 --> 19:09.771
The FBI is tracking me by satellite.

19:09.857 --> 19:12.190
They're gonna move on you
unless we move right now.

19:12.318 --> 19:13.809
Now, take me to my daughter.

19:13.903 --> 19:14.893
Son of a bitch!

19:16.113 --> 19:17.229
Get him in the car.

19:19.200 --> 19:20.816
All units, move now! Go!

19:23.412 --> 19:25.495
(SIRENS WAILING)

19:27.625 --> 19:29.617
- Can your satellite track him?
- I've lost him.

19:29.710 --> 19:31.417
AGENT WATSON: Your friend
just blew this whole operation

19:31.504 --> 19:33.040
and our best chance to get Diaz.

19:33.422 --> 19:34.913
And his daughter's still gonna die.

19:45.142 --> 19:47.850
When this is over, I'm bringing your
friend Quentin up for obstruction.

19:47.937 --> 19:49.769
Our immunity arrangement
doesn't extend to him.

19:49.855 --> 19:52.347
- He was trying to save Laurel.
- Well, I'm trying to save this city.

19:52.441 --> 19:54.182
The city your friend's
supposed to be the mayor of.

19:54.276 --> 19:55.983
I can't believe he'd so something
so reckless.

19:56.070 --> 19:58.778
Or stupid. He knows
Diaz will kill him and Laurel.

19:58.864 --> 20:01.777
- What the hell was he thinking?
- He wasn't. That's the problem.

20:04.120 --> 20:06.237
Before Quentin went to see Diaz,

20:06.997 --> 20:09.080
he went out of his way to tell me
that he had a pacemaker.

20:09.166 --> 20:10.702
And he's never told us that before.

20:11.043 --> 20:12.705
So why would he say something now?

20:14.547 --> 20:16.504
- You can track a pacemaker?
- You know I can.

20:16.590 --> 20:19.628
Quentin knew that Diaz's man
was gonna frisk him for a tracker,

20:19.719 --> 20:21.836
just like he knew that
Diaz wasn't going to actually

20:21.929 --> 20:23.420
bring Laurel to the meet.

20:23.514 --> 20:29.181
So Quentin had Diaz bring him to her,
knowing that we could track him.

20:30.146 --> 20:31.512
How long would it take you to find him?

20:31.605 --> 20:33.392
Give me a high speed connection
and a few minutes.

20:34.400 --> 20:35.811
(QUENTIN GROANS)

20:35.901 --> 20:38.018
DIAZ: You wanted to see her,
now you see her.

20:38.279 --> 20:39.895
I'm a man of my word.

20:41.532 --> 20:43.615
Great. Now, let her go.

20:43.701 --> 20:45.533
I just promised proof of life.

20:46.287 --> 20:47.869
We'll see how long that lasts.

20:55.254 --> 20:56.995
OLIVER: Felicity has Quentin's location.

20:57.089 --> 20:58.876
It's an abandoned chemical plant
on the border of Pennytown.

20:58.966 --> 21:00.082
We're gonna move out in five minutes.

21:00.176 --> 21:01.166
I'll be ready.

21:01.260 --> 21:03.217
The FBI's only objective is Diaz.

21:03.304 --> 21:05.011
They're gonna do their best
to keep Quentin safe,

21:05.097 --> 21:07.430
but they don't care if Black Siren
is collateral damage.

21:07.892 --> 21:09.224
Your point?

21:09.477 --> 21:11.560
My point, Dinah, is that

21:12.438 --> 21:14.020
it's up to us to keep her safe.

21:16.525 --> 21:18.892
I know that you have
put your vendetta aside

21:18.986 --> 21:20.102
for the sake of the mission.

21:20.196 --> 21:21.903
And you wanna make sure
I keep it that way.

21:21.989 --> 21:23.196
I wanna say thank you.

21:26.243 --> 21:28.656
It takes a very big person to not

21:29.580 --> 21:31.367
seek vengeance for someone they love.

21:33.125 --> 21:35.242
If I haven't always been sensitive
to that,

21:36.754 --> 21:38.040
I'm truly sorry.

21:39.006 --> 21:40.747
I'm sorry I was so hard on you.

21:44.428 --> 21:45.964
You know, the truth is,

21:47.223 --> 21:49.510
I respect you more
than you could ever know.

21:51.560 --> 21:53.802
You put together a team of heroes.

- All right.

- Hey.
- What is going on?

22:07.952 --> 22:09.159
What do you mean?

22:09.245 --> 22:10.827
I mean, you've been giving
the "Oliver Farewell" tour

22:10.913 --> 22:13.121
all round this place,
including giving John the hood.

22:14.166 --> 22:15.657
You know, everyone's wondering,

22:16.210 --> 22:19.078
what did you have to give Watson
to get her to give us immunity?

22:19.922 --> 22:21.709
I'm just gonna go out on a limb here

22:23.092 --> 22:26.130
and guess that it was giving up
being the Green Arrow.

to becoming your best self?

get in the middle of that.

a pretty serious marital moment,

You're gonna get in front of the camera,

23:06.719 --> 23:09.462
and you're gonna get the FBI
to leave Star City,

- Don't let him take this city.

- Four.
- He's bluffing. He's lying!

Stay with me.

23:51.305 --> 23:53.217
Don't waste your tears.

23:54.016 --> 23:56.099
Where I shot him,
it'll take a good chunk of time

23:56.185 --> 23:57.426
for him to bleed out.

23:57.728 --> 23:58.718
(GROANING)

23:59.188 --> 24:02.101
Laurel, you need to get your dad

to get on the phone

24:04.818 --> 24:07.185
and get the feds to go back
to their swamp.

another way
