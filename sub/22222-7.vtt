WEBVTT

00:02.295 --> 00:05.128
Aeryn:
He's been hit hard. Crais.

00:05.214 --> 00:08.172
Talyn's supposedly the
meanest, deadliest fighter ship,

00:08.259 --> 00:10.215
but somebody's beat the
yotz out of him.

00:10.303 --> 00:11.634
D'Argo:
That's not Moya.

00:11.721 --> 00:13.757
Let's find the parts to fix the
Transport Pod

00:13.848 --> 00:15.509
and get the frell
out of here.

00:15.600 --> 00:17.465
Help!

00:23.232 --> 00:27.521
The grey girl. Very nice.
And tasty.

00:31.073 --> 00:32.108
Hold the door!

00:32.200 --> 00:33.906
Crichton, get in!

00:34.911 --> 00:36.321
(gasps )

00:36.412 --> 00:39.779
Kaarvok:
l doubled you. | twinned you.

00:39.874 --> 00:42.286
Equal and original.

00:45.004 --> 00:47.120
Now on Farscape:

00:58.809 --> 01:00.390
(rumbling)

01:00.478 --> 01:03.140
Pilot, can't you keep the
environmentals under control?

01:03.231 --> 01:07.315
Transfusing Talyn is a
severe drain upon Moya.

01:07.401 --> 01:11.019
Flying in this turbulent
atmosphere is even more taxing.

01:11.113 --> 01:12.899
I know it's not as bad
as the last time.

01:12.990 --> 01:15.322
It's not the Cro-Magnon copy
of the Alien Nation reject,

01:15.409 --> 01:17.320
but you can tell I'm
the original, right?

01:17.411 --> 01:19.197
Wrong. I'm the original.

01:19.288 --> 01:21.950
Try again, pal. Have you been
messing with my stuff?

01:22.041 --> 01:23.156
That's my stuff.

01:23.251 --> 01:25.958
And you are the clone.

01:26.045 --> 01:28.081
Aeryn, you can tell...
-You can see the difference.

01:28.172 --> 01:30.663
No, l... I can't.

01:35.888 --> 01:38.004
Right. Here.

01:38.099 --> 01:40.511
You wear that, so I can tell
the two of you apart.

01:40.601 --> 01:41.886
Wait. Why do l have to wear it?

01:41.978 --> 01:43.138
Because you're closer.

01:43.229 --> 01:45.140
I want to help you sort
this all out,

01:45.231 --> 01:48.143
but we have bigger problems
right now. Talyn is dying.

01:48.234 --> 01:50.646
But Pilot thinks the Chromextin
will fix Talyn up, right?

01:50.736 --> 01:52.397
lf D'Argo can find it
on the planet.

01:52.488 --> 01:54.069
You shoulda gone
down with him.

01:54.156 --> 01:57.068
Screw you. I'm not gonna
leave Crais alone on Moya.

01:57.159 --> 02:00.367
He is comatose and locked in
a medical stabilizer.

02:00.454 --> 02:02.831
He does not need guarding
from either of you.

02:02.915 --> 02:04.200
I don't trust him.

02:04.292 --> 02:05.122
And what if he's lying?

02:05.209 --> 02:08.292
Fine. You go and keep an
eye on Crais,

02:08.379 --> 02:11.496
and you go to Talyn
and help Stark.

02:11.590 --> 02:13.205
Excuse me, why me?

02:14.135 --> 02:16.046
(thunder crashing)

02:23.436 --> 02:27.645
Rygel:
Excellent. Can you also
provide us with the quantities we require?

02:27.732 --> 02:30.314
Felor:
Yes. I believe we
can do business.

02:30.401 --> 02:32.187
How much Chromextin
did you want?

02:32.278 --> 02:34.485
Uh, six lennerts.

02:34.572 --> 02:36.813
For which we'll pay handsomely.

02:36.907 --> 02:39.944
Still, a transaction of that
magnitude will need

02:40.036 --> 02:42.152
the approval of the
Security Director.

02:42.246 --> 02:44.703
And he dislikes off-worlders,

02:44.790 --> 02:47.748
especially with reputations
such as yours.

02:47.835 --> 02:50.326
Reputations? Us?

02:57.887 --> 02:59.468
What's this?

02:59.555 --> 03:01.216
New talent?

03:01.307 --> 03:04.515
Didn't know Jennet was hiring
exotics these days.

03:04.602 --> 03:06.308
I don't work here.

03:06.395 --> 03:08.636
Well, maybe we'll give
you a try anyway.

03:09.440 --> 03:10.429
(gasps )

03:10.524 --> 03:13.641
Don't move. I'll get it
for you, hmm?

03:14.779 --> 03:16.360
Did you hear me?

03:17.323 --> 03:20.110
I tried. I tried not to
start any trouble.

03:20.201 --> 03:21.611
Well, you're not in any trouble.

03:21.702 --> 03:22.487
( growls )

03:22.578 --> 03:23.693
Well, you are.

03:23.788 --> 03:25.324
( exasperated sigh )

03:33.547 --> 03:35.253
( cries out )

03:42.139 --> 03:44.425
Every frelling planet.

03:50.398 --> 03:51.763
( groans )

03:51.857 --> 03:53.267
( clamoring )

03:53.359 --> 03:54.724
( clears throat)

03:54.819 --> 03:57.356
Where are you going?
We still have business.

03:57.446 --> 04:00.279
Not anymore.
Who do you think that was?

04:00.366 --> 04:02.106
Oh, yotz.

04:03.160 --> 04:05.242
Not the Security Director?

04:11.001 --> 04:12.207
( snarling )

04:12.294 --> 04:14.250
(roaring)

04:15.464 --> 04:18.547
Good luck getting any
Chromextin on this planet.

04:19.343 --> 04:20.253
Wait.

04:20.344 --> 04:22.209
If you think we're leaving
empty handed...

04:22.304 --> 04:25.011
You'll be lucky to
leave at all.

04:35.359 --> 04:38.146
My name is John Crichton...
I'm lost...
an astronaut.

04:38.237 --> 04:41.729
I got shot through a
wormhole... In some distant
part of the universe...

04:41.824 --> 04:43.155
I'm trying to stay alive...

04:43.242 --> 04:45.153
Aboard this ship...
This living ship...

04:45.244 --> 04:48.202
Of escaped prisoners.
My friends.

04:48.289 --> 04:49.779
If you can hear me...
Beware.

04:49.874 --> 04:51.865
lfl make it back...
Will they follow?

04:51.959 --> 04:54.666
If I open the door...
Are you ready?

04:54.753 --> 04:59.213
Earth is unprepared...
Helpless, for the nightmares
I've seen.

04:59.300 --> 05:01.382
Or should I stay...
Protect my home...

05:01.469 --> 05:04.176
Not show them...
You exist...

05:04.263 --> 05:07.972
But then you will never know
the wonders I've seen.

05:40.007 --> 05:43.215
Stark:
No propulsion, no overrides,
no weapons.

05:43.302 --> 05:44.462
All bad.

05:44.553 --> 05:47.886
Talyn's so still,
so near death.

05:49.350 --> 05:50.965
Even the DRDs are still.

05:51.060 --> 05:52.425
ldidn't know he had DRDs.

05:52.520 --> 05:55.102
He builds them as he grows.
Come on.

05:55.189 --> 05:57.271
The primary conduit nexus is
completely overloaded.

05:57.358 --> 05:58.393
That's why nothing works.

05:58.484 --> 06:00.224
What about the neural
link to Crais?

06:00.319 --> 06:02.275
The link?
Yes, that's operating.

06:02.363 --> 06:05.355
Crais's autonomic functions may
be the only thing that's
keeping Talyn going.

06:05.449 --> 06:07.030
Here, here.
-That the conduit?

06:07.117 --> 06:08.243
Yeah, yeah.

06:08.327 --> 06:10.113
What if you've got this
backwards?

06:10.204 --> 06:12.320
What if we pull Crais's
transponder?

06:12.414 --> 06:14.075
He dies and Talyn lives?

06:14.166 --> 06:15.155
Tried that.

06:15.251 --> 06:16.832
Nearly killed Talyn.

06:16.919 --> 06:18.159
(giggles )

06:18.254 --> 06:20.336
We can't break the link.

06:20.422 --> 06:23.380
We've got to fix the conduit
and restore Talyn's caloric
flow, so wake him up.

06:23.467 --> 06:25.378
(soft humming)

06:27.930 --> 06:29.295
Anything?

06:29.390 --> 06:31.506
Yes. I'm hungry and there's
nothing sweet on this ship.

06:31.600 --> 06:34.137
l was talking about
your patient.

06:34.228 --> 06:38.141
Well, the lortinol injection I
gave him seems to be having
no effect whatsoever.

06:38.232 --> 06:40.268
I thought you knew something
about medicine.

06:40.359 --> 06:42.065
I do.

06:42.152 --> 06:46.065
I'll have you know I earned
T-ratings in genetics,
neuroscience and xenobiology.

06:46.156 --> 06:48.408
Good. That's what I thought.

06:50.911 --> 06:52.196
What are you doing?

06:52.288 --> 06:56.327
Zhaan took some tissue and DNA
samples from me awhile back.

06:56.417 --> 06:59.784
I want you to compare 'em
to me and the clone,

06:59.878 --> 07:02.870
and figure out that I'm the real
thing and he's the wannabe.

07:02.965 --> 07:06.457
And why should I do your
selfish and unnecessary work?

07:06.552 --> 07:10.591
Because I know where Rygel
stashes his womilin cake.

07:10.681 --> 07:14.390
And it's sweeter than a
sweet thing, sweet thing.

07:18.606 --> 07:20.062
Give it to me.

07:20.149 --> 07:22.390
Mmm, yes.

07:22.484 --> 07:24.395
(moaning)

07:34.455 --> 07:35.285
(shrieks)

07:35.372 --> 07:37.112
Whatever are you are,

07:37.207 --> 07:38.913
release me!

07:42.755 --> 07:43.870
( screaming )

07:43.964 --> 07:46.671
(shrieking)

07:46.759 --> 07:48.750
Aeryn! Maintenance Bay!

07:49.970 --> 07:52.757
Crais! Let her go.

07:53.390 --> 07:55.130
(gagging )

07:56.060 --> 07:58.142
(gasping for air)

08:00.272 --> 08:02.854
There. I woke him up.

08:02.941 --> 08:03.771
(sharp groan)

08:03.859 --> 08:06.145
Now I hope he drops dead.

08:07.363 --> 08:09.228
Crichton.

08:09.323 --> 08:11.029
Am I on Moya?

08:11.116 --> 08:13.232
John, what's...
-lt's okay.

08:13.327 --> 08:15.067
What?

08:16.914 --> 08:18.450
Aeryn Sun?

08:20.334 --> 08:22.871
Yeah, you missed that bit.

08:22.961 --> 08:26.249
You're alive. How?

08:26.340 --> 08:30.333
Let's skip the back story
right now. What happened
to your ship?

08:30.427 --> 08:32.839
Where's Talyn?
I can barely sense him.

08:32.930 --> 08:36.422
Aeryn:
He is alive, but unresponsive.

08:36.517 --> 08:39.179
Moya is supplying nutrients.

08:39.269 --> 08:42.477
Where are we? ln open space?

08:42.564 --> 08:44.429
Low planetary orbit.

08:44.525 --> 08:48.234
Talyn and Moya found an
atmosphere with a very high
nelvastatic index.

08:49.279 --> 08:51.235
That may conceal us.

08:51.323 --> 08:53.234
Who did you piss off this time?

08:53.325 --> 08:55.111
Talyn and l were not
the aggressors.

08:55.202 --> 08:57.158
Course not. You never are.

08:57.246 --> 08:58.361
So who is it?

08:58.455 --> 09:01.162
The Plakavoids? The Skeksis?

09:01.250 --> 09:02.490
Big bad wolf?

09:02.584 --> 09:04.370
Peacekeepers.

09:05.254 --> 09:08.462
They want Talyn back.

09:12.553 --> 09:14.965
The Luxan will be disciplined.

09:15.055 --> 09:17.341
I apologize for his behavior.

09:17.433 --> 09:20.971
According to some witnesses,
he has nothing to
apologize for.

09:21.061 --> 09:24.303
You saying I was at fault?

09:24.398 --> 09:27.435
Father, these are
known criminals.

09:27.526 --> 09:29.812
The path of destruction
they leave gave us...

09:29.903 --> 09:32.189
Don't believe those myths.

09:32.281 --> 09:35.023
You know how rumors
get started.

09:35.117 --> 09:37.574
Then you deny your reputation?

09:37.661 --> 09:39.447
l deny its relevance.

09:39.538 --> 09:44.328
We're here for one reason,
to buy Chromextin.

09:44.418 --> 09:45.203
Ooh!

09:45.294 --> 09:46.750
Why do you need such
a large amount?

09:46.837 --> 09:49.123
Oh... mmmm.

09:49.214 --> 09:51.125
Medical purposes, hmm?

09:51.216 --> 09:54.128
Chromextin has no
medical function.

09:54.219 --> 09:56.130
None that you know of, brother.

09:56.221 --> 09:58.473
But it can power weapons.

09:58.557 --> 10:03.347
Should we sell them ammunition
they can use to attack us? Hmm?

10:03.437 --> 10:05.268
Their warships? Our ammunition?

10:05.355 --> 10:07.812
We have no warships.

10:07.900 --> 10:12.314
Then why hide your vessels in
the densest layer of our
bonosphere?

10:12.404 --> 10:15.646
To avoid conflict.

10:15.741 --> 10:21.156
I understand that, as this
planet's ruler, you must
protect its people.

10:21.246 --> 10:24.329
Be assured we pose
you no threat.

10:24.416 --> 10:29.536
Allow us this simple
transaction, and you'll
never see us again.

10:29.630 --> 10:31.871
| see no reason not to
accommodate them.

10:31.965 --> 10:34.502
| see no reason to
let them live.

10:34.593 --> 10:36.254
Force is your answer
to everything.

10:36.345 --> 10:37.630
Better than weak, mindless
pacifism...

10:37.721 --> 10:38.380
Stop!

10:38.472 --> 10:39.757
(gasps )

10:41.350 --> 10:44.433
We'll not do business with you.

10:44.520 --> 10:48.934
Tolven, they have one am
to break orbit.

10:49.024 --> 10:51.436
But...
-After that,

10:51.527 --> 10:54.189
force is authorized.

10:55.531 --> 10:57.237
May I show you out?

10:57.324 --> 11:02.114
We were attempting to resupply,
but we were ambushed by
four Prowlers

11:02.204 --> 11:04.741
using strike and
retreat tactics.

11:05.666 --> 11:07.327
You don't believe me, Crichton.

11:10.379 --> 11:13.041
Pilot, l'm accessing
Talyn's logs.

11:13.131 --> 11:14.871
Please display the
signal for us.

11:14.967 --> 11:16.707
Very well, Crais.

11:16.802 --> 11:21.466
Talyn destroyed one Prowler,
but their attack was merely
a diversion.

11:25.853 --> 11:31.064
That ship is a Panthak
class Vigilante.

11:31.149 --> 11:32.355
Yes.

11:32.442 --> 11:36.185
Surprising us with an
Immobilizer Pulse,

11:36.280 --> 11:39.989
severely overloading all
Talyn's systems and
dissipating his energy.

11:40.075 --> 11:45.240
We barely broke free initiating
Starburst but that drained the
last of Talyn's power.

11:45.330 --> 11:46.740
I remember nothing further.

11:46.832 --> 11:50.871
A Vigilante with an
Immobiliser Pulse.

11:52.045 --> 11:56.630
What attacked Talyn was
a Retrieval Squad.

11:56.717 --> 12:01.177
They will not relent until they
accomplish their goal:
recapture Talyn.

12:01.263 --> 12:07.304
And to force Talyn's surrender,
they wouldn't hesitate to take
Moya hostage.

12:07.394 --> 12:11.637
I will return to Talyn so that
Moya can flee immediately.

12:11.732 --> 12:12.972
(grunts)

12:13.066 --> 12:15.478
With Talyn's condition
worsening,

12:15.569 --> 12:19.232
Moya will not abandon him
and neither will we.

12:20.699 --> 12:23.907
Rygel:
All right. Start up the Pod.
We're leaving.

12:26.705 --> 12:28.661
D'Argo? Chiana?

12:28.749 --> 12:29.864
Where are you?

12:29.958 --> 12:32.040
A Refreshment House.

12:32.127 --> 12:33.833
We're trying to find
another source.

12:33.921 --> 12:38.290
Perhaps you don't realize but
we've been given one am
toleave.

12:38.383 --> 12:41.420
With or without you,
I'm returning to Moya.

12:41.511 --> 12:43.217
You aren't going anywhere.

12:43.305 --> 12:45.170
What? What have you done
with the Pod?

12:45.265 --> 12:48.223
Well, nothing you can fix.

12:49.394 --> 12:51.771
Did I lose consciousness again?

12:54.358 --> 12:55.564
Briefly.

12:56.401 --> 12:57.937
ls Crichton present?

12:58.028 --> 12:59.188
Shall I summon him?

12:59.279 --> 13:02.612
No. There is something I deeply
wish to share with you.

13:05.410 --> 13:09.198
Talyn was designed with
intelligence gathering
facilities.

13:09.289 --> 13:14.534
He and l have been able to tap
into high level Peacekeeper
comm channels,

13:14.628 --> 13:18.166
accessing their
central database.

13:18.256 --> 13:24.252
Including your personnel file,
where I found...

13:24.346 --> 13:26.302
this.

13:50.080 --> 13:53.072
Xhalax:
Aeryn, wake up.

13:55.419 --> 13:57.284
Wake up, Aeryn.

13:59.339 --> 14:01.330
Don't be afraid.

14:01.425 --> 14:04.883
My name is Xhalax Sun.

14:04.970 --> 14:07.131
I'm your mother.

14:07.222 --> 14:09.838
But you mustn't reveal to
anyone that l was here.

14:09.933 --> 14:11.889
Do you understand?

14:13.270 --> 14:15.886
I came to tell you something.

14:17.107 --> 14:21.476
Aeryn, your life was
not an accident.

14:21.570 --> 14:25.813
And it wasn't an assigned
birthing to fill the ranks.

14:26.992 --> 14:31.782
Talyn, that's your
father's name.

14:31.872 --> 14:35.410
He and I chose to have you.

14:36.376 --> 14:39.618
You were conceived in love.

14:41.465 --> 14:43.547
Our love.

14:45.052 --> 14:48.010
I wanted you to know this.

14:49.264 --> 14:51.129
It makes you special.

14:51.224 --> 14:53.636
We wanted you.

14:55.604 --> 14:58.186
And we love you.

14:58.273 --> 15:00.309
Go back to sleep now.

15:08.241 --> 15:10.277
My mother?

15:10.911 --> 15:12.321
Yes.

15:13.914 --> 15:16.951
l was never sure whether
I dreamt that.

15:18.418 --> 15:20.124
And that was on my file?

15:20.212 --> 15:22.248
And hers as well.

15:22.339 --> 15:26.548
I thought it might interest you
to learn of your parents.

15:26.635 --> 15:28.717
And my father. Was he...
Did you...

15:28.804 --> 15:34.765
I could find no information
whatever about him.

15:39.397 --> 15:41.262
Was my mother court-martialed?

15:41.358 --> 15:43.644
There are gaps in her
service record.

15:43.735 --> 15:50.777
However, its last entry notes
her promotion into an elite
battle group.

15:50.867 --> 15:52.448
Aeryn...
-Let me guess.

15:52.536 --> 15:57.530
The Retrieval Squad.
She is somehow part of it.

15:57.624 --> 16:03.415
The squad is under the command
of Senior Officer Xhalax Sun.

16:08.051 --> 16:12.465
Remove your lower garments
and face away from me.

16:12.556 --> 16:13.887
What the hell for?

16:13.974 --> 16:15.805
Oh, you asked me.

16:15.892 --> 16:18.599
If you want a genetic
comparison I need a specimen.

16:18.687 --> 16:19.597
Of what?

16:19.688 --> 16:22.020
Well, skin.

16:22.107 --> 16:24.644
Unless you prefer I test
your internal organs.

16:24.734 --> 16:27.771
You can stay the hell away
from my organs, lady.

16:27.863 --> 16:29.569
Well, skin then.

16:29.656 --> 16:32.819
Preferably something with the
least amount of exposure to
solar radiation.

16:32.909 --> 16:35.161
Shoulder. I use SPF 30...

16:35.245 --> 16:36.451
No!

16:37.831 --> 16:39.196
Thank you.

16:46.339 --> 16:49.331
Recon Stations report the probe
has not left the planet.

16:49.426 --> 16:50.541
And their other ships?

16:50.635 --> 16:52.546
Still concealed in
the bonosphere.

16:52.637 --> 16:55.754
Probes detect an unidentified
mass in geosynchronous orbit.

16:55.849 --> 16:58.511
Coordinates precise
enough to target?

16:58.602 --> 17:00.467
Airborne Defense says not yet.

17:00.562 --> 17:04.271
They suggest
concussion missiles.

17:04.357 --> 17:06.848
Well have them fire at will.

17:17.954 --> 17:19.819
Oh! It's not working,
it's not helping!

17:19.915 --> 17:21.655
Talyn's dying, not waking up.

17:21.750 --> 17:23.206
Astro.

17:23.293 --> 17:27.582
Work now, freak later.

17:27.672 --> 17:28.707
Work now...

17:28.798 --> 17:31.210
Oh, yeah... Yes...
that's fair.

17:31.843 --> 17:32.798
Good.

17:32.886 --> 17:34.376
How much later?

17:38.558 --> 17:40.890
( screams )

17:41.937 --> 17:42.926
Pilot!

17:43.021 --> 17:45.478
Missiles, launched from
the planet.

17:45.565 --> 17:47.146
Exploding in the atmosphere.

17:47.234 --> 17:50.226
Aeryn, I'm going to Command.
You stay with Captain Crunched.

17:50.320 --> 17:52.311
What about me?

17:52.405 --> 17:54.316
Pilot, get the planet
on the blower.

17:54.407 --> 17:59.572
I can't. The nelvastatic cloud
cover blocks communications
as well as scans.

17:59.663 --> 18:02.450
They can't establish a missile
lock, so they're trying to
flush us out.

18:02.540 --> 18:04.246
Take us up, out of range.

18:04.334 --> 18:05.790
Crais:
No, Pilot.

18:05.877 --> 18:08.209
If we ascend out of
the bonosphere,

18:08.296 --> 18:11.333
we may be revealing ourselves
to the Retrieval Squad.

18:14.761 --> 18:17.878
Ah, hell, I can't see a damn
thing in this soup.

18:17.973 --> 18:23.263
Moya is attempting to extend
her senses further, but...

18:23.353 --> 18:25.810
Oh, there's another one.
Brace for the shockwave.

18:31.987 --> 18:35.195
Noble Talyn, I stand ready to
ease your passage into death.

18:35.282 --> 18:38.240
Knock that off and help me
get weapons back on line!

18:38.326 --> 18:41.193
Why don't you listen?
The weapons console
won't function.

18:41.288 --> 18:43.654
Crais, are you still in
contact with Talyn?

18:43.748 --> 18:45.454
Can you get his
weapons working?

18:45.542 --> 18:47.282
He has insufficient energy
to fire.

18:47.377 --> 18:50.460
Well can he do anything?
Can he point the damn guns?

18:50.547 --> 18:52.538
I believe I can enable
targeting.

18:52.632 --> 18:55.374
Right, do that. Pilot, I want
you to take us down.

18:55.468 --> 18:57.004
Pilot:
Below the cloud layer?

18:57.095 --> 18:59.177
Do it, Pilot! I think I know
what he's trying to do.

18:59.264 --> 19:00.470
He's going to need a
comms channel.

19:00.557 --> 19:03.173
And I'm gonna need a
comms channel.

19:03.268 --> 19:06.135
Crais, I want you to find the
fattest target you can.

19:06.229 --> 19:09.721
Government house, missile site,
McDonald's, whatever.

19:09.816 --> 19:12.774
Two ships are descending
from the bonosphere.

19:15.697 --> 19:18.063
It's a gunship.

19:18.158 --> 19:20.274
We're being targeted.

19:22.412 --> 19:24.368
Crichton:
Now, Crais!

19:27.042 --> 19:28.452
Hello, morons.

19:28.543 --> 19:30.204
You see this ship?

19:30.295 --> 19:33.162
Knock off the missile attack,
or we'll take our shot.

19:33.256 --> 19:34.496
Prepare another salvo.

19:34.591 --> 19:36.877
Oh, you might want to check
our resume first.

19:36.968 --> 19:39.630
We leveled a Shadow Depository
and we're about to
turn your city

19:39.721 --> 19:41.712
into glow-in-the-dark sand.

19:41.806 --> 19:42.795
Launch missiles.

19:42.891 --> 19:43.630
No!

19:43.725 --> 19:45.340
Father!
-No.

19:47.062 --> 19:50.350
Airborne defenses stand down.

19:52.317 --> 19:54.273
The missiles have ceased.

19:54.361 --> 19:56.352
It's about damn time.
Who the hell are you?

19:56.446 --> 19:59.938
Rinic Pralanoth,
Sovereign of Kanvia.

20:00.033 --> 20:02.570
John Crichton, Wizard of Oz.

20:02.660 --> 20:05.902
You ready to knock off the macho
BS. and talk these things out?

20:05.997 --> 20:08.784
I'm willing to reopen
the discussion.

20:08.875 --> 20:11.036
Good. I'll notify my reps.

20:11.127 --> 20:14.494
I'd prefer that you and
I spoke face to face.

20:14.589 --> 20:16.625
Fine. I'll come down.

20:17.342 --> 20:19.333
My offspring.

20:23.181 --> 20:26.719
Rinic Sarova,
Services Director.

20:26.810 --> 20:30.177
So tell me, Rinic,
Rinic and Rinic

20:30.271 --> 20:32.136
What's your problem?

20:32.232 --> 20:33.563
We come down here to
buy something.

20:33.650 --> 20:36.266
We don't hassle you, we don't
try to take it by force.

20:36.361 --> 20:39.023
Hell, we offer to
make you rich,

20:39.114 --> 20:41.230
and you guys break out
the pyrotechnics.

20:41.324 --> 20:43.360
Violence was an error
on our part.

20:43.451 --> 20:47.490
Allowing notorious criminals
onto our planet was
a worse error.

20:47.580 --> 20:49.741
Criminal?

20:49.833 --> 20:51.289
No, no, no.

20:51.376 --> 20:52.411
We're businessmen.

20:52.502 --> 20:53.833
( chuckles )

20:53.920 --> 20:55.080
Lies.

20:55.171 --> 20:57.423
That's a big word to throw
around, son.

20:57.507 --> 20:59.338
I can prove it.

21:03.513 --> 21:05.299
Get your hands off of me!

21:05.390 --> 21:06.596
Damn it, let me go!

21:06.683 --> 21:09.095
This is not... not necessary!

21:14.899 --> 21:16.855
What the hell is that?

21:16.943 --> 21:18.558
(grunts)

21:18.653 --> 21:21.395
Get this thing off of me!

21:21.489 --> 21:24.026
Damn, you people got a
funky sense of humor.

21:24.117 --> 21:26.199
( soft growl )
Get this lobster off my head!

21:26.286 --> 21:27.867
It won't hurt you.

21:27.954 --> 21:29.910
Unless you lie to us.

21:29.998 --> 21:32.990
It's a very intuitive creature.

21:33.084 --> 21:36.326
It senses brain wave patterns,

21:36.421 --> 21:41.256
and is extremely sensitive
to cognitive dissonance.

21:41.342 --> 21:44.334
You lie, and it knows.

21:44.429 --> 21:49.890
And it's been trained to
kill when it detects a
lie being told.

21:49.976 --> 21:54.015
Why have you come to Kanvia?

21:54.105 --> 21:57.188
To buy Chromextin. Period.

21:57.275 --> 21:59.231
For what purpose?

21:59.319 --> 22:01.310
None of your damn business.

22:02.739 --> 22:06.903
Nothing that affects you.

22:06.993 --> 22:10.110
Are you planning to
seize power, hmm?

22:10.205 --> 22:12.947
Or perhaps one of the
subcounselors is getting
ambitious again.

22:13.041 --> 22:16.329
Have you been hired to
sabotage our unification?

22:16.419 --> 22:20.207
We could give a damn about
your local politics.

22:20.298 --> 22:23.540
We're here to buy the stuff and
then get the hell out of Dodge!

22:23.635 --> 22:28.254
Why is that so difficult for
you to get through your
tiny little brain?

22:30.225 --> 22:32.011
Remove the strannat.

22:39.067 --> 22:40.603
Calorics have dropped to
critical levels.

22:40.693 --> 22:43.651
The Immobilizer Pulse
overloaded too many of
Talyn's systems.

22:43.738 --> 22:45.353
Repairs alone cannot save him.

22:45.448 --> 22:47.814
What can we do?
-Nothing, until the
Chromextin arrives.

22:47.909 --> 22:51.493
But after that, Aeryn,
you must join us.

22:51.579 --> 22:53.319
Your mother's involved now.

22:53.414 --> 22:54.824
She'll take him alive
if possible.

22:54.916 --> 22:57.032
But I know Talyn.
He'll fight to the death.

22:57.126 --> 22:58.115
His or your Mother's.

22:58.211 --> 23:00.452
And you expect me to fight
on Talyn's side?

23:00.547 --> 23:03.334
I hope your presence will
provide another solution.

23:03.424 --> 23:04.925
She loved you.

23:05.009 --> 23:08.092
And if that part of her still
lives, only you can find it.

23:08.179 --> 23:10.795
She's an officer.
Part of the elite.

23:10.890 --> 23:12.300
She is nothing.

23:12.392 --> 23:13.848
A thug.

23:13.935 --> 23:18.850
A mindless assassin,
as you and I once were.

23:18.940 --> 23:24.355
But you can give her a chance
to be something more than that.

23:24.445 --> 23:26.276
Daybreak? Talyn may be
dead by then.

23:26.364 --> 23:28.229
It's the best I could do.

23:28.324 --> 23:31.191
The old man says it's going to
take him that long to scrape
up six whatevers.

23:31.286 --> 23:33.948
Lennerts.
-Lennerts. Right.

23:34.038 --> 23:36.415
Says there's not enough in
any one single parish,

23:36.499 --> 23:38.239
so he's got to send his
deputies out to collect it,

23:38.334 --> 23:40.074
and who the hell knows
if that's true.

23:40.169 --> 23:43.297
Well, it may be true.
I spent the whole day
trying to buy some.

23:43.381 --> 23:46.043
There wasn't one source
that had the whole amount
that we need.

23:46.134 --> 23:49.626
I say we just go get the guns
and steal the stuff.

23:49.721 --> 23:53.179
We would have to complete
ten robberies to do that.

23:53.266 --> 23:55.723
Yeah. So what's your point?

23:59.272 --> 24:01.388
Is this a proposition?

24:03.735 --> 24:06.522
Sarova:
John Crichton this
is Rinic Sarova.

24:06.613 --> 24:10.856
Phone. Oh, hey, hey, hey.
Um... how you doing?

24:10.950 --> 24:13.942
We must speak privately about
the Chromextin you require.

24:14.037 --> 24:15.777
I fear you'll never get it.

24:15.872 --> 24:17.453
Are you willing to
meet me alone?

24:17.540 --> 24:19.201
How about we talk about
it right now?

24:19.292 --> 24:23.911
No. There's a service corridor
behind the Refreshment House
you're in.

24:26.758 --> 24:27.998
I don't like it either.

24:28.092 --> 24:29.081
Mmm.

24:47.487 --> 24:49.318
Shall we go inside?

24:49.405 --> 24:51.657
It's closed. The door's locked.

24:51.741 --> 24:53.777
I own this Refreshment House.

24:53.868 --> 24:56.484
In that case, you can
buy me a drink.

24:58.623 --> 25:00.113
How can there be a problem?

25:00.208 --> 25:02.415
Your father promised he'd
get us the stuff.

25:02.502 --> 25:04.493
My brother objects.

25:04.587 --> 25:06.327
He won't defy my father openly,

25:06.422 --> 25:08.378
but he will try to block this
transaction somehow.

25:08.466 --> 25:11.128
And Daddy can't keep
him leashed?

25:11.219 --> 25:13.710
You think my father's weak?
-You tell me.

25:15.014 --> 25:16.970
Pralanoth unified this planet.

25:17.058 --> 25:20.596
He ended the wars between
nation states and brought
peace to this world.

25:20.687 --> 25:24.976
Excepting the occasional missile
attack on visiting ships.

25:25.066 --> 25:26.602
That was Tolven's doing.

25:26.693 --> 25:29.150
Yeah. Your brother got
a death wish?

25:29.237 --> 25:31.148
No, but he wants to rule.

25:31.239 --> 25:34.106
Mmm. Meaning he wants
Daddy's job.

25:34.200 --> 25:38.569
Yes. However, Pralanoth has
decreed that after his death,

25:38.663 --> 25:40.278
Tolven and I should
share power.

25:40.373 --> 25:42.989
Well, your brother doesn't
strike me as the, uh...

25:43.084 --> 25:45.040
sensitive powersharing type.

25:45.128 --> 25:47.119
We took an oath that we
would co-rule,

25:47.213 --> 25:50.171
but I'm sure that Tolven will
disregard it and seize control.

25:50.258 --> 25:51.794
Can't you stop him?

25:51.884 --> 25:54.671
The conflict would fragment
this world once again.

25:54.762 --> 25:57.219
I would prefer my father
saw reason.

25:57.306 --> 25:59.467
And put you on top.

25:59.559 --> 26:02.096
Tolven suspects this.

26:02.186 --> 26:07.431
He also knows he lost face when
my father overruled his
missile attack.

26:09.152 --> 26:13.270
He, uh... could have lost
a whole lot more.

26:14.991 --> 26:17.903
You know, you really don't want
to see what our gunship can do.

26:17.994 --> 26:20.360
But Tolven would risk it.

26:20.455 --> 26:23.117
He is sure to interfere with
the Chromextin delivery,

26:23.207 --> 26:27.325
hoping to provoke you
into attacking us.

26:27.420 --> 26:32.210
And he counterattacks,
proving to Pop that he
was right all along.

26:32.675 --> 26:34.040
Yes.

26:34.135 --> 26:36.842
I therefore ask for patience.

26:36.929 --> 26:39.545
I've been nothing but patient.

26:39.640 --> 26:44.054
And, uh... I think you need to
understand that I'm under
a lot of pressure.

26:44.145 --> 26:47.137
I do understand and I will
do all I can to hasten
the process.

26:47.231 --> 26:52.225
Even if it means bypassing
normal channels to locate
my own source of...

27:04.207 --> 27:05.822
Uh... Sarova?

27:05.917 --> 27:09.034
I never thought my brother
capable of this.

27:09.128 --> 27:11.369
Crichton!
-He's over there.

27:11.756 --> 27:13.542
Hey.

27:13.633 --> 27:15.544
Don't pull it out!

27:17.261 --> 27:18.592
(yelling)

27:18.679 --> 27:21.056
Get Crichton away from here.

27:21.140 --> 27:23.927
No one must find us together.
This meeting never happened.

27:24.018 --> 27:26.179
Go. Now!

27:27.146 --> 27:29.137
Rygel? We're on our way.

27:29.232 --> 27:30.597
Rygel:
Well, hurry up!

27:35.154 --> 27:37.987
Come to finish the task,
my brother?

27:45.289 --> 27:46.574
Salvako! He's bleeding!

27:46.666 --> 27:48.577
You have a keen grasp
of the obvious.

27:48.668 --> 27:50.909
Help him. Help him!

27:57.343 --> 27:58.924
How is he?

27:59.011 --> 28:00.342
Don't know yet.

28:01.973 --> 28:04.089
D'Argo:
You're doing fine.

28:04.183 --> 28:05.923
Yeah, right.

28:06.018 --> 28:08.395
I could be killing him
for all you know.

28:10.106 --> 28:12.518
A major artery's been cut.
He's lost a lot of blood.

28:12.608 --> 28:14.940
Well then replace.
You're similar species.

28:15.027 --> 28:16.187
Are you klemmpt?

28:16.279 --> 28:19.066
Even within my species,
the subtypes have to match.

28:19.156 --> 28:21.283
My blood is donor incompatible.

28:21.367 --> 28:23.232
Take mine.

28:23.870 --> 28:25.326
Really?

28:25.413 --> 28:27.950
Yeah, I know, he's an ugly
Ioudmouth son of a bitch,

28:28.040 --> 28:30.326
but I can't stand around
and watch him die.

28:30.418 --> 28:33.000
Be better for both of us
if you did.

28:34.005 --> 28:35.370
Yeah, I know.

28:35.464 --> 28:37.045
Now shut up.

28:45.391 --> 28:51.603
Jool:
Well, neither his genetic
sample nor yours shows any sign of degradation.

28:52.315 --> 28:54.476
You're both perfect.

28:54.567 --> 28:56.478
If that's the right word.

28:56.569 --> 28:58.605
Copies of the
original Crichton.

28:58.696 --> 29:01.312
Screw your tests.
I'm the original.

29:01.407 --> 29:03.147
Of course you are.

29:03.242 --> 29:04.903
The other guy said
the same thing.

29:04.994 --> 29:06.985
Why does this bother you?

29:07.079 --> 29:09.161
Don't humans have monozygotic
double births?

29:09.248 --> 29:11.330
This is different.

29:11.417 --> 29:15.456
Twins don't start out fully
formed, sharing the same life.

29:15.546 --> 29:16.956
This sucks.

29:17.048 --> 29:18.504
It sucks big time.

29:18.591 --> 29:20.422
How you doing?

29:21.260 --> 29:22.340
Crappy.

29:22.428 --> 29:25.340
On the upside, it's easier
to tell us apart now.

29:25.431 --> 29:28.264
D'Argo filled me in on your
adventures with the
Gotti family,

29:28.351 --> 29:30.012
but I need some details
from you.

29:30.102 --> 29:31.012
Why?

29:31.103 --> 29:33.765
Because the show must go on.

29:33.856 --> 29:36.518
Why won't you tell me
the truth?

29:36.609 --> 29:39.646
Did tell you.

29:39.737 --> 29:44.481
You went to the Refreshment
House for an after hours
drink, alone.

29:44.575 --> 29:46.315
Yes.

29:46.410 --> 29:49.698
A witness saw a wounded
Crichton being taken out
after the explosion.

29:49.789 --> 29:51.700
Mistaken.

29:51.791 --> 29:53.452
Then you deny he was with you?

29:53.542 --> 29:55.794
Give me strannat to prove.

29:55.878 --> 29:58.244
Tolven, don't be ridiculous.

29:58.339 --> 30:00.580
Sarova would not lie to me.

30:00.675 --> 30:02.165
Crichton:
Morning, all.

30:02.259 --> 30:03.544
Ho, ho.

30:03.636 --> 30:06.673
And what a beautiful morning
it is. How y'all doing?

30:06.764 --> 30:12.350
We have two, count 'em, two,
Transport Pods, on your loading
dock ready and waiting...

30:12.436 --> 30:14.267
What the hell happened to you?

30:14.355 --> 30:17.472
A bomb exploded at the
Refreshment House.

30:17.566 --> 30:18.692
No.

30:18.776 --> 30:20.767
Well, hell, who would do
such a thing?

30:20.861 --> 30:22.397
Tolven:
You tell us.

30:22.488 --> 30:25.571
You were there having a secret
meeting with Sarova.

30:25.658 --> 30:26.773
No, lwasn't.

30:26.867 --> 30:28.949
You were seen.
I have a witness.

30:29.036 --> 30:33.496
Who also swore that Crichton
was badly wounded.

30:33.582 --> 30:35.959
Well maybe his species
heals rapidly.

30:36.043 --> 30:38.250
Maybe your witness was blitzed.

30:38.337 --> 30:41.454
Now, why, other than
a social call,

30:41.549 --> 30:44.256
would I be having a secret
meeting with Sarova?

30:44.343 --> 30:48.256
Well, I have to assume you were
conspiring to take power.

30:48.347 --> 30:52.306
Perhaps you two were
constructing a bomb and it
accidentally went off.

30:52.393 --> 30:53.929
I want an apology.

30:54.020 --> 30:55.180
I want the truth.

30:55.271 --> 30:58.104
You can't handle the...

30:58.691 --> 31:02.980
Oh, let's cut the crap.

31:03.070 --> 31:06.938
Let's get to the chase,
stick this critter on my face.

31:07.033 --> 31:09.024
Whoa, ho, ho!

31:09.118 --> 31:11.700
Yeah, look at the suckers
on that boy!

31:11.787 --> 31:15.871
Damn, in some parts of the
universe this thing would be
considered good eating!

31:15.958 --> 31:17.118
Whoo!

31:17.209 --> 31:19.245
Ha, ha!

31:19.336 --> 31:23.329
My name is John Crichton,
astronaut.

31:23.424 --> 31:26.461
l was not at the Refreshment
House after hours.

31:29.513 --> 31:34.883
I did not have a private
meeting with the beautiful
Miss Sarova.

31:34.977 --> 31:36.057
The end.

31:36.145 --> 31:38.761
Cross my heart, smack me dead,

31:38.856 --> 31:41.689
stick a lobster on my head.

31:49.283 --> 31:52.025
Our money is in the
Transport Pods.

31:52.119 --> 31:56.453
Can we have our stuff
now, please?

31:56.540 --> 31:58.326
Give it to them.

31:59.502 --> 32:01.458
Two lennerts are packaged
and ready.

32:01.545 --> 32:03.661
The rest is still on
its way here.

32:03.756 --> 32:05.496
Then load it up.

32:08.636 --> 32:11.252
Whoa, okay...

32:13.390 --> 32:14.971
Oh.

32:15.059 --> 32:16.924
How are you doing?

32:17.019 --> 32:19.385
Jool did good. I'm all right.

32:19.480 --> 32:23.564
Well, Rygel and Chiana have
just delivered a partial load
of Chromextin to Talyn,

32:23.651 --> 32:28.611
and that may boost his kelvo
levels enough to bring him
out of his paralysis.

32:28.697 --> 32:30.483
So, what's next?

32:30.574 --> 32:35.364
Well, now Crais will divert all
of Talyn's energies into
restoring Starburst.

32:35.454 --> 32:37.194
Meaning he plans to ditch.

32:37.289 --> 32:39.245
He is protecting Talyn.

32:39.333 --> 32:41.073
Yeah, you keep saying that.

32:41.168 --> 32:44.205
Well, you know, he has
saved our lives.

32:44.296 --> 32:46.002
He did kill Scorpius.

32:46.090 --> 32:49.207
I don't know what it's going to
take for you to trust him.

32:50.594 --> 32:53.961
So you trust him?

32:54.056 --> 32:58.675
Well, whether or not I trust
him, this time I do
believe him.

33:00.479 --> 33:01.935
So what do we do?

33:02.022 --> 33:04.729
Spread it all over the
exposed conduits.

33:04.817 --> 33:06.728
Rygel, you take the inner hull.

33:06.819 --> 33:09.526
Ha! Do I look like a DRD?

33:09.613 --> 33:11.604
Yeah. You do, actually.

33:11.699 --> 33:13.564
So make yourself useful...

33:13.659 --> 33:16.366
Oh, no, no, I don't want...
-and act like one.

33:18.038 --> 33:20.370
( Rygel muttering angrily)

33:21.458 --> 33:24.200
Oh, yes, this is a very dark
and smelly place.

33:26.255 --> 33:28.837
I hate being useful!

33:28.924 --> 33:31.711
Yeah, we know.

33:31.802 --> 33:33.303
Where else?

33:37.641 --> 33:39.302
(moaning)

33:40.227 --> 33:41.637
(low rumbling)

33:42.646 --> 33:43.726
(Crais screaming )

33:43.814 --> 33:45.475
Pilot:
Something has begun.

33:45.566 --> 33:47.648
What have you done?

33:47.735 --> 33:49.191
Crais, what's the matter?

33:49.278 --> 33:51.735
Crais! Crais!
-Crais!

33:51.822 --> 33:53.904
Crais, what is it?
-Murderers!

33:53.991 --> 33:55.481
Hold him down!
-Help me!

33:55.576 --> 33:56.782
Crais, what's happening?

33:56.869 --> 33:59.406
Crais, what is it, what's
happening?

33:59.830 --> 34:02.071
Poison!

34:04.251 --> 34:05.331
What went wrong?

34:05.419 --> 34:08.627
Oh, I don't know.

34:08.714 --> 34:11.421
The Chromextin should have
acted as a stimulant.

34:11.508 --> 34:14.295
Instead, it sent Talyn
into convulsions.

34:17.806 --> 34:21.890
Well, it's definitely
Chromextin.

34:21.977 --> 34:24.263
But apparently, it's laced
with Clorium.

34:24.355 --> 34:25.310
What's Clorium?

34:25.397 --> 34:27.353
An anesthetic that numbs
Leviathans.

34:27.441 --> 34:30.649
Oh, mixing that with a
stimulant probably wasn't
a very good idea.

34:30.736 --> 34:34.945
Anyway, glad I could help,
but it's been an extremely
long day.

34:35.032 --> 34:37.364
Sorry, Jool. We need you to
work some overtime.

34:37.451 --> 34:40.284
We need you to strain the
Clorium out of that stuff.

34:40.371 --> 34:42.111
With this equipment,
it's gonna take forever.

34:42.206 --> 34:46.950
And even if I was sure of how
to do it, which I'm not...

34:47.544 --> 34:49.284
Pilot?
-Yes, Commander.

34:49.380 --> 34:53.714
Can Moya filter out the poison
like she did when Aeryn
was sick?

34:53.801 --> 34:56.008
Moya is willing to try.

34:56.095 --> 34:58.632
You sure it won't harm Moya?
The Clorium?

34:58.722 --> 35:01.099
Her mass is much greater
than Talyn's.

35:01.183 --> 35:04.220
She believes its effects upon
her will be minimal.

35:04.311 --> 35:07.269
All right, tell Chiana and Jool
what to do. I'm heading
back to Talyn.

35:07.356 --> 35:09.017
Same here.

35:09.858 --> 35:11.723
Jool:
You open, I'll pour.

35:11.819 --> 35:13.229
Fine.

35:18.742 --> 35:21.358
You're spilling it.
-Oh, you wanna pour?

35:23.247 --> 35:25.158
The Retrieval Squad are here.

35:25.249 --> 35:26.864
They have to be.

35:26.959 --> 35:28.165
I think you're right.

35:28.252 --> 35:31.335
You do know, John, that if
we can revive Talyn,

35:31.422 --> 35:34.255
we have to Starburst away
immediately and we
can't go back.

35:34.341 --> 35:37.549
Yeah, I kind of figured
that when I saw you
packing your bag.

35:39.221 --> 35:40.631
We heading down?

35:40.723 --> 35:44.307
Yes. I'm just going to duck
under the bonosphere
for a microt,

35:44.393 --> 35:46.349
so we can contact them
with the news.

35:46.437 --> 35:48.428
Oh, that's gonna make
them really happy.

35:51.650 --> 35:53.481
You've been screwin' me
from the beginning.

35:53.569 --> 35:55.275
Uh-uh. I don't think so.

35:55.362 --> 35:58.650
Screwin' everybody.
Screwin' your sister.

35:58.741 --> 36:01.904
You been lying to your Daddy,
boy, and you know you
shouldn't lie to your Daddy.

36:01.994 --> 36:04.110
It's gonna stop.
Who's your Daddy?

36:04.204 --> 36:05.705
Come on, you know who
your Daddy is.

36:05.789 --> 36:07.825
Who's your Daddy? D'Argo, tell
him who his Daddy is.

36:07.916 --> 36:09.076
I'm your Daddy.

36:09.168 --> 36:10.328
That's right.

36:10.419 --> 36:12.785
We're gonna start tellin'
the truth.

36:15.466 --> 36:20.176
The prosecution calls
Mr. Rinic Junior to the stand.

36:20.262 --> 36:23.129
Did you poison the Chromextin?

36:23.223 --> 36:24.633
What are you talking about?

36:24.725 --> 36:27.011
It was poisoned with Clorium.

36:27.102 --> 36:28.683
Did you contaminate it?

36:28.771 --> 36:30.136
No.

36:30.230 --> 36:34.064
You had nothing whatsoever to
do with poisoning it?

36:34.151 --> 36:35.937
Nothing whatever.

36:36.028 --> 36:38.189
Then who did?

36:38.280 --> 36:39.315
I don't know.

36:39.406 --> 36:40.521
(chittering )

36:40.616 --> 36:42.197
Does this crab thing
always work?

36:42.284 --> 36:46.948
In a few rare cases a
disciplined mind has
managed to fool it.

36:47.039 --> 36:49.280
You... you tell me that now?

36:49.375 --> 36:51.957
But my offspring are not liars.

36:52.044 --> 36:57.584
Ha. At the Refreshment House,
did you plant the bomb
or have it planted?

36:57.674 --> 37:00.336
No and no.

37:00.427 --> 37:02.543
But you fired the
missiles at our ship.

37:02.638 --> 37:04.048
Oh, absolutely.

37:04.139 --> 37:06.175
And you didn't want us to
get any Chromextin.

37:06.266 --> 37:08.882
Of course. I never thought
you should get any.

37:08.977 --> 37:13.687
But when I've been overruled,
I've complied with my
father's orders.

37:13.774 --> 37:14.980
Yeah.

37:15.067 --> 37:17.228
Ain't you just a good
andloyalson.

37:17.319 --> 37:19.105
(chittering )

37:19.196 --> 37:22.984
I'm sorry, I didn't hear that.

37:23.075 --> 37:27.068
Are you not a good
andloyalson?

37:27.162 --> 37:28.618
Tell him.

37:29.540 --> 37:31.246
I don't have to answer to him.

37:31.333 --> 37:34.621
But you do have to
answer to me.

37:34.711 --> 37:36.372
I don't need to prove myself.

37:36.463 --> 37:38.328
Get this thing off me!

37:39.383 --> 37:40.623
Do you hear me?

37:40.717 --> 37:43.959
Do you hear me? Answer.

37:44.054 --> 37:45.260
Father...

37:45.347 --> 37:48.009
Have you been disloyal?

37:49.226 --> 37:50.932
Yes or no?

37:52.062 --> 37:54.724
You swore an oath
to this family.

37:54.815 --> 37:56.931
Have you dishonored it?

37:58.110 --> 38:00.271
Do you intend to?

38:00.362 --> 38:01.272
No!

38:01.363 --> 38:03.228
( screaming )

38:17.254 --> 38:19.085
Get out of here.

38:39.985 --> 38:42.271
Stark, power is returning.

38:42.362 --> 38:43.693
Keep splicing those conduits.
-Splicing, fixing, fixing.

38:43.780 --> 38:46.032
Splicing, splicing,
fixing, fixing.

38:46.116 --> 38:47.777
Splicing...

38:47.868 --> 38:49.779
Talyn is...

38:51.872 --> 38:55.114
Talyn, can you hear me?

38:55.209 --> 38:57.200
( muted beeps )

38:57.836 --> 38:59.076
Welcome back.

38:59.171 --> 39:00.160
Can he Starburst?

39:00.255 --> 39:01.506
Not yet.

39:01.590 --> 39:04.002
But the treatment is working.
Calorics are rising.

39:04.092 --> 39:05.798
Sarova:
Where are they?

39:05.886 --> 39:08.002
Must be back aboard
their ships.

39:08.096 --> 39:09.757
All their Transport Pods
are gone.

39:09.848 --> 39:11.304
Fire concussion missiles.

39:11.391 --> 39:12.722
No.

39:13.644 --> 39:15.851
Father...

39:15.938 --> 39:17.769
We must avenge Tolven.

39:17.856 --> 39:20.142
There's nothing to avenge.

39:20.234 --> 39:24.318
Tolven's betrayal is what
caused his death.

39:26.365 --> 39:28.071
(gasping)

39:33.455 --> 39:34.615
( beeping )

39:38.001 --> 39:41.118
Airborne Defense.
This is Sarova.

39:41.213 --> 39:43.579
About time.
-Anything going on?

39:45.342 --> 39:47.253
Okay, here we go again.

39:47.344 --> 39:49.380
Talyn can't take this
punishment.

39:49.471 --> 39:51.336
Pilot! We must ascend.

39:51.431 --> 39:54.639
But is Talyn recovered
enough to Starburst?

39:54.726 --> 39:56.466
Irrelevant now.
We cannot stay here.

39:56.562 --> 39:58.143
We dare not descend.

39:58.230 --> 39:59.595
Release the umbilicals.

39:59.690 --> 40:00.975
Moya refuses.

40:01.066 --> 40:03.227
She won't leave Talyn behind.
Naturally.

40:03.318 --> 40:05.229
If Moya will not
disengage, I will.

40:05.320 --> 40:07.276
Talyn, listen to me.

40:07.364 --> 40:08.274
You must ascend.

40:08.365 --> 40:10.401
He's right, Talyn.
Let Moya get to safety.

40:10.492 --> 40:12.448
Do not resist me.

40:18.125 --> 40:19.365
Pilot:
We're out of the bonosphere

40:19.459 --> 40:21.666
and Moya's sensing a
Peacekeeper scan.

40:21.753 --> 40:24.085
Talyn, Starburst immediately.

40:24.172 --> 40:25.878
Now, Talyn.

40:25.966 --> 40:28.833
Yes, you can. You must.

40:33.098 --> 40:35.305
Talyn's done it. He's escaped.

40:35.392 --> 40:38.259
Prepare for immediate Starburst.

41:03.128 --> 41:05.210
(gasping)

41:22.397 --> 41:24.012
( muffled scream )

41:27.527 --> 41:29.438
(roaring)

41:49.383 --> 41:51.419
( screaming )

41:51.510 --> 41:53.296
(roaring)

41:58.308 --> 42:00.640
Have both ships Starburst away?

42:00.727 --> 42:05.437
They must have discovered the
Clorium contamination and
filtered it out.

42:05.524 --> 42:07.640
How much Chromextin
did they get?

42:07.734 --> 42:11.022
Two Lennerts. A third of
what they asked for.

42:11.113 --> 42:15.356
Then the gunship will remain
debilitated for some time.

42:15.450 --> 42:17.236
We need only find it.

42:17.327 --> 42:19.238
I failed.

42:19.329 --> 42:22.287
Aren't you going to kill me?

42:22.374 --> 42:23.614
Come on.

42:23.709 --> 42:26.075
( growls )

42:32.259 --> 42:33.339
He took Wynonna.

42:33.427 --> 42:37.011
Well, at least he left you
this lovely jacket.

42:37.097 --> 42:38.587
l was wearing that.

42:38.682 --> 42:41.389
Oh, come on.
Crack a smile, will you?

42:41.476 --> 42:42.682
At least he's out of your nose.

42:42.769 --> 42:44.054
Hair?

42:44.146 --> 42:45.682
That's what I meant.
At least out of your nose hair.

42:45.772 --> 42:48.889
My notebook! He... he took
my notebook and my pen.

42:48.984 --> 42:50.349
The son of a bitch set me up.

42:50.444 --> 42:53.686
He set it up so that he's
on Talyn with Aeryn.

42:53.780 --> 42:57.773
Now, wouldn't you have done
exactly the same thing?

42:57.868 --> 43:00.154
No, lwould not.

43:00.245 --> 43:01.655
Yes.

43:01.747 --> 43:04.580
Maybe, I don't know.
I just...

43:04.666 --> 43:06.998
I just hope he's having a good
time. No, forget that.

43:07.085 --> 43:09.792
I hope he's having a
terrible time.

43:09.880 --> 43:11.871
I don't know what I hope.

43:11.965 --> 43:13.671
He just better be
taking care of her.

43:13.759 --> 43:15.966
Oh, I'm sure he's
taking care of her.

43:16.052 --> 43:17.713
You know what I mean.

43:17.804 --> 43:20.796
What do you mean, you're not
taking us back to Moya?

43:20.891 --> 43:22.677
Rygel, we can't go back yet.

43:22.768 --> 43:25.430
There will be no contact
with Moya

43:25.520 --> 43:28.057
until the threat of the
Retrieval Squad is resolved.

43:28.148 --> 43:31.060
He's right, Rygel. So we just
have to accept it gracefully.

43:31.151 --> 43:32.937
Frell gracefully.

43:33.028 --> 43:37.146
Well, if! must be in prison
here, feed me and show me
to my quarters.

43:37.240 --> 43:40.653
Talyn's passenger facility
isn't fully developed yet.

43:40.744 --> 43:42.325
Food will be tightly rationed,

43:42.412 --> 43:46.246
and you two will have to
share accommodation.

43:46.333 --> 43:47.573
Unacceptable.

43:47.667 --> 43:50.830
There'll be my side and your
side. My side, your side.

43:51.421 --> 43:53.457
Don't start.

43:56.718 --> 43:59.960
Look, do you... do you really
know what you're in for?

44:00.055 --> 44:02.262
Oh, I never do.

44:03.475 --> 44:06.888
Is there something that
you're not telling me?

44:11.733 --> 44:14.816
The Retrieval Squad is
commanded by my mother.

44:16.446 --> 44:17.902
Your mother?

44:19.115 --> 44:20.195
Right.

44:20.283 --> 44:22.319
She's out here, chasing Talyn.

44:22.410 --> 44:24.275
Yeah. How do you know that?

44:24.371 --> 44:25.656
Crais told me.

44:25.747 --> 44:28.955
Crais? Look, there are zillions
of Peacekeepers.

44:29.042 --> 44:31.533
Why would your mother
be assigned?

44:31.628 --> 44:33.869
You really think it's
a coincidence?

44:36.132 --> 44:38.999
No.

44:39.094 --> 44:42.552
l have to assume that they
are aware of my relationship
with Talyn,

44:42.639 --> 44:46.882
and that they are hoping that
my mother's presence will
divide my loyalties.

44:46.977 --> 44:50.640
But I will not let them
get Talyn back,

44:50.730 --> 44:53.563
even if it means I
have to kill her.
