00:03.503 --> 00:05.704
<i>My name is Sydney Bristow.</i>

00:05.705 --> 00:07.139
<i>Seven years ago,
I was recruited</i>

00:07.140 --> 00:10.598
<i>by a secret branch of the CIA
called SD-6.</i>

00:10.710 --> 00:12.144
<i>I was sworn to secrecy,</i>

00:12.145 --> 00:14.413
<i>but I couldn't keep it
from my fianc√©,</i>

00:14.414 --> 00:16.815
<i>and when the head of SD-6
found out,</i>

00:16.816 --> 00:19.316
<i>he had him killed.</i>

00:19.452 --> 00:20.886
<i>That's when I learned
the truth.</i>

00:20.887 --> 00:22.988
<i>SD-6 is not part of the CIA.</i>

00:22.989 --> 00:24.656
<i>I'd been working
for the very people</i>

00:24.657 --> 00:26.792
<i>I thought
I was fighting against.</i>

00:26.793 --> 00:28.160
<i>So I went to the only place</i>

00:28.161 --> 00:30.062
<i>that could help me
take them down.</i>

00:30.063 --> 00:31.930
<i>Now I'm a double agent
for the CIA,</i>

00:31.931 --> 00:35.264
<i>where my handler
is a man named Michael Vaughn.</i>

00:36.269 --> 00:38.931
<i>Only one other person knows
the truth about what I do.</i>

00:39.039 --> 00:41.735
<i>Another double agent
inside SD-6.</i>

00:41.841 --> 00:44.341
<i>Someone I hardly know.</i>

00:44.411 --> 00:46.911
<i>My father.</i>

00:47.313 --> 00:48.647
We still don't know
who was behind

00:48.648 --> 00:50.582
last week's invasion of SD-6.

00:50.583 --> 00:52.084
Learning that information
and getting

00:52.085 --> 00:54.781
a visual I.D. Of "The Man"
is our top priority.

00:54.854 --> 00:56.355
The meeting with K-Directorate

00:56.356 --> 00:58.824
is scheduled
to take place in Moscow.

00:58.825 --> 01:01.817
You'll be surveilling
this meeting from outside.

01:01.895 --> 01:03.629
We're on.

01:03.630 --> 01:06.130
They're heading
toward the building now.

01:08.701 --> 01:10.402
Gentlemen, welcome.

01:10.403 --> 01:13.372
I'm Mr. Sark,
Director of Operations.

01:13.473 --> 01:15.340
My employer's offer is simple.

01:15.341 --> 01:17.443
You will give us
the Rambaldi manuscript

01:17.444 --> 01:19.611
you recently acquired
in Argentina...

01:19.612 --> 01:22.240
Sydney,
that is llyich Ivankov,

01:22.315 --> 01:24.516
the head of K-Directorate.

01:24.517 --> 01:26.085
You tell your employer...

01:26.086 --> 01:29.021
he ever wastes
my time like this again,

01:29.089 --> 01:31.323
and our next meeting
will not be so cordial.

01:36.329 --> 01:38.957
Congratulations, Comrade Kessar.

01:39.032 --> 01:41.200
You have just
inherited control

01:41.201 --> 01:43.701
of the indestructible
K- Directorate.

01:50.410 --> 01:52.910
Sydney?

01:54.000 --> 02:00.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:25.138 --> 03:26.138
Wait.

03:36.616 --> 03:39.116
- Thanks.
- Anytime.

03:55.868 --> 03:57.502
Do you want some?

03:57.503 --> 03:59.671
No, thanks.

03:59.672 --> 04:01.607
I gotta go interview
David McNeil today.

04:01.608 --> 04:02.941
Mm-hmm.

04:02.942 --> 04:04.776
Yeah.

04:04.777 --> 04:06.612
I better go.

04:06.613 --> 04:08.614
- Mmm.
- Ooh, I better go.

04:08.615 --> 04:10.282
I'm gonna be late.

04:10.283 --> 04:12.783
Okay.

04:14.354 --> 04:16.387
So, what are you
gonna wear?

04:16.389 --> 04:18.490
I'm just gonna wear this.
I think.

04:18.491 --> 04:20.192
I'm just going to a prison.
Who cares?

04:20.192 --> 04:21.760
No, next week.

04:21.761 --> 04:23.762
- What am I gonna wear next week?
- To the dinner.

04:23.763 --> 04:25.430
- What dinner?
- You didn't get my letter?

04:25.431 --> 04:27.899
- What letter?
- The one I left on your desk.

04:27.900 --> 04:29.067
What are you talking about?

04:29.068 --> 04:31.136
Okay, you know what?

04:31.137 --> 04:33.970
You really have to start

04:34.040 --> 04:36.804
reading the things
I give to you, Will.

04:36.876 --> 04:37.709
What's this?

04:37.710 --> 04:40.577
You're getting the Kaplan Award
for the Luis Maroma article.

04:40.647 --> 04:41.780
What?

04:41.781 --> 04:43.348
Yes. The readers voted it

04:43.349 --> 04:46.785
one of the 10 most inspirational
stories of the year.

04:46.853 --> 04:48.954
I can't believe
anyone read that article.

04:48.955 --> 04:50.956
It says "black tie,"
which means tux.

04:50.957 --> 04:51.890
Do you have one?

04:51.891 --> 04:53.358
Well, I have an old one.

04:53.359 --> 04:55.127
I can't believe I won
the Kaplan Award.

04:55.128 --> 04:57.628
Do you want to go celebrate?
Maybe Friday?

04:59.132 --> 05:01.266
Oh, I can't. I can't.

05:01.267 --> 05:03.268
I gotta do
something on Friday.

05:03.269 --> 05:04.770
I'm sorry.

05:04.771 --> 05:07.271
Oh.

05:07.540 --> 05:08.707
Okay.

05:11.611 --> 05:13.779
Yeah, I know.
Well, thanks.

05:13.780 --> 05:16.476
Yeah, I just wanted
to tell you.

05:16.549 --> 05:18.717
Will, that is so amazing.

05:18.718 --> 05:20.052
Oh, "North by Northwest"

05:20.053 --> 05:22.321
is playing
at the Fairfax on Friday night.

05:22.322 --> 05:23.922
I thought maybe we could

05:23.923 --> 05:25.290
get some dinner
and celebrate it.

05:25.291 --> 05:27.816
Definitely.
I'm so proud of you.

05:27.894 --> 05:30.162
Oh, it's not that big a deal.

05:30.163 --> 05:32.164
Okay, so Friday night.
It's a date.

05:32.165 --> 05:34.665
It's a date.

05:39.839 --> 05:42.339
Lompoc Prison.
About two hours ago.

05:42.408 --> 05:43.875
The man talking to Tippin

05:43.876 --> 05:46.376
is David McNeil,
software designer.

05:46.446 --> 05:49.074
About eight years ago,
he created an encryption system

05:49.148 --> 05:51.648
that we wanted to acquire,
but he wouldn't sell.

05:51.684 --> 05:53.051
We don't have audio,

05:53.052 --> 05:55.454
but we got hold of
the prison log.

05:55.455 --> 05:57.823
This is Tippin's
third visit to McNeil

05:57.824 --> 06:00.384
in the last two weeks.

06:00.460 --> 06:05.159
You and I talked about Tippin
some time ago.

06:05.231 --> 06:07.032
You convinced me
that he was just

06:07.033 --> 06:11.800
a harmless metro reporter,
far from a credible threat.

06:13.172 --> 06:15.672
But now he's found McNeil.

06:18.277 --> 06:19.711
What are you suggesting?

06:19.712 --> 06:22.212
You know
what I'm suggesting.

06:22.882 --> 06:25.150
The decision to eliminate
Tippin is premature.

06:25.151 --> 06:26.585
He's a friend of Sydney's

06:26.586 --> 06:28.220
who, as far as we know,
knows nothing.

06:28.221 --> 06:31.054
I told you this first
as a courtesy.

06:31.124 --> 06:33.225
Jack, I understand
your reluctance.

06:33.226 --> 06:35.093
What this would mean
to Sydney.

06:35.094 --> 06:37.129
But McNeil is not
a benign element.

06:37.130 --> 06:38.964
And he knows about SD-6.

06:38.965 --> 06:41.695
The division's name was
mentioned in Koenig's testimony.

06:41.768 --> 06:42.968
Just the name.
Nothing else.

06:42.969 --> 06:45.203
A name is all Tippin needs.

06:45.204 --> 06:48.173
What concerns me is this
doesn't seem to concern you.

06:48.241 --> 06:51.870
There's a difference between
concern and assassination.

06:53.312 --> 06:55.347
What are you suggesting?

06:55.348 --> 06:56.581
That we get audio.

06:56.582 --> 06:59.676
That we find out
what those conversations are.

07:03.990 --> 07:05.457
Jack...

07:05.458 --> 07:07.958
we should take care of this
immediately.

07:08.027 --> 07:10.128
I'm sure you agree.

07:10.129 --> 07:13.223
There are some truths
that Sydney must never learn.

07:59.312 --> 08:01.279
How's it going?

08:01.280 --> 08:03.780
Fine.

08:04.750 --> 08:07.275
I went to
the stationery store today.

08:07.353 --> 08:10.117
Same place I got
the wedding invitations.

08:10.189 --> 08:11.423
I had to buy
some thank-you cards

08:11.424 --> 08:14.291
for these engagement gifts,
to send back to people.

08:16.329 --> 08:17.896
The woman in the store

08:17.897 --> 08:20.889
asked if I wanted
the card stock

08:20.967 --> 08:23.467
to match the invitations.

08:25.571 --> 08:28.631
I burst into tears
in the middle of the store.

08:32.611 --> 08:35.111
Francie?

08:35.381 --> 08:38.009
I don't know how to do this.

08:39.684 --> 08:43.313
I haven't even been able
to take this off.

08:48.661 --> 08:51.323
Oh. I'm sorry.

08:51.397 --> 08:53.922
Nah, don't be.

08:56.669 --> 09:00.127
The truth is, I should have
taken it off a long time ago.

09:07.246 --> 09:09.281
Here's an idea.

09:09.282 --> 09:11.782
What?

09:43.416 --> 09:45.183
So, Wilshire Court, 7:30.

09:45.184 --> 09:46.718
I got my ball in my car.

09:46.719 --> 09:48.320
Oh, call Mitch.

09:48.321 --> 09:49.321
- You got it.
- Cool.

09:49.322 --> 09:51.189
Well, well,
look who it is.

09:51.190 --> 09:52.691
Abby, what is this?

09:52.692 --> 09:55.192
Oh, false modesty. Hideous.
Doesn't suit you.

09:55.194 --> 09:57.629
This isn't for the most
inspirational article, is it?

09:57.630 --> 09:58.797
Pretty dense
for the man who wrote

09:58.798 --> 10:00.565
the most inspirational article.

10:00.566 --> 10:01.866
You don't deserve to win.

10:01.867 --> 10:04.102
- I know.
- Congratulations.

10:04.103 --> 10:05.904
Thank you.

10:05.905 --> 10:07.439
You make me sick, FYI.

10:07.440 --> 10:10.409
10 years I've been at this,
and what do I win?

10:10.476 --> 10:13.104
- Tickets to "The Lion King. "
- You never invited me to that.

10:13.179 --> 10:14.980
Oh, imagine that.

10:14.981 --> 10:17.115
Thank you for the cake.
I'm gonna get us some plates.

10:17.116 --> 10:19.517
I expect a piece, yes.
It's chocolate.

10:19.518 --> 10:22.248
Maybe you can write
an article about this cake

10:22.321 --> 10:24.821
and win something else.

10:29.428 --> 10:31.062
Excuse me.
June Litvack's office?

10:31.063 --> 10:33.131
Yeah, that's the next floor up.
Huge office.

10:33.132 --> 10:35.632
Thanks.

10:48.247 --> 10:50.909
If I didn't have to go,
I'd eat the whole cake.

10:50.983 --> 10:52.517
Where are you going?

10:52.518 --> 10:55.018
Lompoc. I got an interview.

10:55.087 --> 10:57.749
Your surveillance footage
of Moscow is remarkable.

10:57.823 --> 10:59.724
Of course, we won't know
for quite some time

10:59.725 --> 11:01.660
the full implication
of Ivankov's murder,

11:01.661 --> 11:03.061
but here's what we do know.

11:03.062 --> 11:05.363
Ivankov's body
was delivered last night

11:05.364 --> 11:08.060
to K-Directorate Headquarters
in St. Petersburg.

11:08.134 --> 11:09.134
Delivered how?

11:09.135 --> 11:10.235
Commercial freight carrier.

11:10.236 --> 11:13.694
Packed inside a crate
of frozen Atlantic codfish.

11:13.806 --> 11:17.298
Lavro Kessar, K-Directorate
Second-in-Command.

11:17.410 --> 11:19.310
He hasn't been seen
since that night.

11:19.311 --> 11:23.111
We believe he's being held
by Mr. Sark as a captive.

11:23.182 --> 11:26.583
Unless K-Directorate
delivers Rambaldi's manuscript

11:26.652 --> 11:29.382
to Sark's employer,
"The Man,"

11:29.455 --> 11:32.322
they should be expecting
more fish in St. Petersburg.

11:32.391 --> 11:34.859
Have we learned anything more
about "The Man"?

11:34.860 --> 11:36.761
We have to get a name
for this guy already.

11:36.762 --> 11:38.930
Well, we don't know
anything concrete yet.

11:38.931 --> 11:41.366
We have learned
something about Sark.

11:41.367 --> 11:43.001
- Marshall?
- Yes, okay.

11:43.002 --> 11:45.270
Um, actually,
I'm sure we've all seen

11:45.271 --> 11:47.605
the classic movie
"My Fair Lady. "

11:47.606 --> 11:49.007
Professor Henry Higgins

11:49.008 --> 11:51.841
educatin' Eliza Doolittle,
"you talk proper. "

11:51.911 --> 11:54.012
My favorite Rex Harrison film

11:54.013 --> 11:56.481
was "Doctor Dolittle,"
which always threw me.

11:56.482 --> 11:58.616
You had Eliza Doolittle,
Dr. Dolittle.

11:58.617 --> 12:00.618
Doolittle, Dolittle.
Was that on purpose? Conspiracy?

12:00.619 --> 12:02.420
- Is it a...
- Marshall.

12:02.421 --> 12:03.555
Right.

12:03.556 --> 12:05.457
We've analyzed
Sark's speech pattern.

12:05.458 --> 12:06.858
Lilt, stress, rhythm.

12:06.859 --> 12:08.226
He is very clever.

12:08.227 --> 12:11.253
His, uh, grammar and syntax

12:11.330 --> 12:13.264
give away nothing,
but his lengthened vowels

12:13.265 --> 12:16.496
indicate that he spends
considerable time in Ireland.

12:16.569 --> 12:17.869
Most likely Galway.

12:17.870 --> 12:20.238
Our assets in Tunis
spotted a K-Directorate boat

12:20.239 --> 12:22.107
passing through
the Golfe de Hammamet port.

12:22.108 --> 12:23.808
It's now moored off Es-Sekhira.

12:23.809 --> 12:25.443
Tomorrow at 10:00 a. m.
local time,

12:25.444 --> 12:29.278
a plane is scheduled to leave
from nearby Gafsa Airport

12:29.348 --> 12:31.816
to fly to Galway, Ireland.

12:31.817 --> 12:34.377
They're handing over Rambaldi's
manuscript in Tunisia.

12:34.453 --> 12:37.752
The mission is to intercept
the book and bring it back home.

12:37.823 --> 12:41.281
Review the mission details.
Go over op tech with Marshall.

12:42.661 --> 12:45.161
You'll leave tonight.

12:49.435 --> 12:51.035
This look familiar?

12:51.036 --> 12:54.437
The same kind of camera
I left behind in Argentina.

12:54.507 --> 12:55.774
It is that camera.

12:55.775 --> 12:58.243
The CIA sent a team
and retrieved it last week.

12:58.244 --> 13:00.211
You only took a few shots
of the Rambaldi book.

13:00.212 --> 13:01.312
I know.

13:01.313 --> 13:03.838
But we did learn a lot
from those pictures.

13:03.916 --> 13:06.416
Like what?

13:06.619 --> 13:08.753
I...

13:08.754 --> 13:11.222
I've got this aunt.
Aunt Trish.

13:11.223 --> 13:12.791
She's the insane one
in the family.

13:12.792 --> 13:15.292
She speaks to the dead.
She goes to readings.

13:15.327 --> 13:17.695
She's a crop-circle worshiper.

13:17.696 --> 13:18.830
- Aunt Trish.
- Yeah.

13:18.831 --> 13:20.498
This whole Rambaldi story

13:20.499 --> 13:23.559
reminds me of something
she would tell me about.

13:23.636 --> 13:27.333
Anyway, we know that Rambaldi
was a 16th-century inventor

13:27.439 --> 13:30.806
who seemed to have had an almost
psychic vision of technology.

13:30.876 --> 13:33.011
This book,
based on the images you took,

13:33.012 --> 13:35.446
seems to be some sort
of instruction manual.

13:35.447 --> 13:36.948
To what, we don't know.

13:36.949 --> 13:39.975
This was written in Italian.

13:40.052 --> 13:42.552
On the second page.

13:42.655 --> 13:43.855
And at the bottom,

13:43.856 --> 13:47.292
Rambaldi refers
to the "100 segments. "

13:47.359 --> 13:48.259
Meaning what?

13:48.260 --> 13:50.695
Well, it continues on a page
we don't have yet.

13:50.696 --> 13:53.324
So your countermission
is the same as in Argentina.

13:53.399 --> 13:56.027
When you get the Rambaldi book,
photograph the pages

13:56.101 --> 13:58.729
and deliver the originals
to SD-6 and the photos to us.

13:58.838 --> 14:01.830
Just don't screw it up
this time. Got it.

14:01.941 --> 14:03.241
Your father's been reporting

14:03.242 --> 14:05.176
that Sloane
spent a lot of time at home.

14:05.177 --> 14:07.771
Yeah, his wife, Emily.
She's sick.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.347
You two
used to be close, right?

14:09.348 --> 14:10.615
We still are.

14:10.616 --> 14:12.350
Less so since she was diagnosed.

14:12.351 --> 14:14.851
She's been a little reclusive.

14:14.987 --> 14:16.988
Actually, I haven't seen her

14:16.989 --> 14:19.357
since before I learned
the truth about her husband.

14:19.358 --> 14:21.559
I think this is
a real opportunity.

14:21.560 --> 14:24.060
We'd like you to call Emily,
tell her you'd like to see her,

14:24.096 --> 14:26.264
and get invited to their house.

14:26.265 --> 14:28.299
You want me to plant a bug.

14:28.300 --> 14:30.501
Vaughn,
she's dying of cancer.

14:30.502 --> 14:31.636
Yes, I know.

14:31.637 --> 14:33.271
You're asking me
to use this woman.

14:33.272 --> 14:35.073
- She will never know.
- I will.

14:35.074 --> 14:37.308
We've been trying to plant
a listening device in SD-6.

14:37.309 --> 14:40.403
That office uses every possible
countersurveillance technique.

14:40.479 --> 14:42.814
But this isn't
a logistical question.

14:42.815 --> 14:45.375
- This is a moral one.
- Sydney, you're a spy.

14:45.451 --> 14:48.045
What you're not hearing is
Emily is my friend.

14:48.120 --> 14:50.455
Despite her husband,
she is my dying friend.

14:50.456 --> 14:52.590
Does this not seem
at all wrong to you?

14:52.591 --> 14:53.958
Why does this
seem wrong to you?

14:53.959 --> 14:55.627
She's innocent.
She is a good person.

14:55.628 --> 14:57.629
Then, what she will never know,

14:57.630 --> 14:59.530
is that this is one
of the last opportunities

14:59.531 --> 15:02.031
she has to do something good.

15:04.436 --> 15:06.137
Emily, hi.

15:06.138 --> 15:08.732
It's Sydney Bristow.

15:09.441 --> 15:10.441
Hi. I know.

15:10.442 --> 15:12.176
I know, it has.

15:12.177 --> 15:15.203
Are you busy or sleeping?

15:15.281 --> 15:17.781
Good, okay.

15:18.117 --> 15:21.450
Yeah, yeah.
I'm doing fine.

15:21.520 --> 15:22.487
How are you?

15:22.488 --> 15:25.184
That's why I called.
I just...

15:26.258 --> 15:28.758
I miss you.

15:30.829 --> 15:32.830
Have you heard
from your daughter?

15:32.831 --> 15:35.925
No. No, my lawyer
says she's safe.

15:36.001 --> 15:38.501
That's all
I really want to know.

15:38.971 --> 15:40.772
So, what do you got?

15:40.773 --> 15:41.906
Okay.

15:41.907 --> 15:44.142
Based on the file
at O.T. Technologies,

15:44.143 --> 15:47.374
42 companies currently use
your encryption software.

15:47.446 --> 15:49.747
- 42?
- Yeah.

15:49.748 --> 15:54.651
I've had time to look into
about 18 of these companies.

15:54.720 --> 15:55.753
Listen to this.

15:55.754 --> 15:58.254
Six of them
have a common board member.

15:58.324 --> 16:01.555
A guy by the name
of Alain Christophe.

16:02.628 --> 16:03.962
This is the best part.

16:03.963 --> 16:07.922
12 years ago,
Alain decides to retire...

16:09.134 --> 16:11.369
...from the CIA.

16:11.370 --> 16:14.339
And before that,
from '82 to '89,

16:14.406 --> 16:17.398
he ran counterintelligence
at Langley.

16:21.213 --> 16:23.014
Why are you smiling?

16:23.015 --> 16:25.677
Because for the first time
in eight years,

16:25.751 --> 16:28.549
SD-6 should be afraid of me.

16:33.692 --> 16:36.192
Do a Lexis/Nexis for everything
on Alain Christophe.

16:36.228 --> 16:37.328
And call the IRS.

16:37.329 --> 16:38.997
See if
the Freedom of Information Act

16:38.998 --> 16:41.165
covers access
to his private holdings.

16:41.166 --> 16:43.999
Oh, get "North by Northwest"
tickets. Friday night.

16:44.103 --> 16:46.765
Call Mercantile. See if
you can get a reservation.

16:46.872 --> 16:49.372
Son of a bitch.

16:56.281 --> 16:58.583
Resist and you die.

16:58.584 --> 17:01.084
Get out.

17:50.102 --> 17:52.070
Okay, tell me the truth.

17:52.071 --> 17:54.571
Who do you like better?
Mary Ann or Ginger?

17:54.673 --> 17:59.167
Listen, while you're
grabbing Rambaldi's manuscript,

17:59.278 --> 18:01.412
if you happen
to see a sandwich...

18:01.413 --> 18:02.647
You got it.

18:02.648 --> 18:05.708
Okay.
I'll radio if Sark arrives.

18:05.784 --> 18:08.284
Good luck.

18:36.815 --> 18:37.882
Gasoline?

18:37.883 --> 18:39.283
Gasoline.

18:39.284 --> 18:41.085
<i>Ja.</i>

19:30.869 --> 19:32.436
Okay, Dixon,
the boat's secure.

19:32.437 --> 19:34.962
I'm opening the case.
The guy's handcuffed to it.

19:35.073 --> 19:37.041
I'm picking the lock.

19:37.042 --> 19:40.068
Looks like
it's electromagnetic.

19:40.179 --> 19:41.245
Okay.

19:41.246 --> 19:43.746
Still no sign of Sark.

20:28.493 --> 20:30.993
Yuri?

20:55.921 --> 20:58.055
Okay, I've got the book.

20:58.056 --> 21:00.291
Sydney, Sark's here.

21:01.460 --> 21:03.960
I'm taking the boat.

21:06.598 --> 21:07.932
Okay.

21:07.933 --> 21:09.300
I'll meet you
at the airport dock.

21:09.301 --> 21:11.801
We'll be in the air
in 30 minutes.

21:42.834 --> 21:45.236
Okay, look, guys...

21:54.012 --> 21:56.572
Six of them
have a common board member.

21:56.648 --> 21:59.617
A guy by the name
of Alain Christophe.

21:59.685 --> 22:02.185
This is the best part.

22:02.220 --> 22:05.417
About 12 years ago,
Alain decides to retire...

22:05.490 --> 22:07.990
from the CIA.

22:12.431 --> 22:15.662
Do you
value your life, Mr. Tippin?

22:17.169 --> 22:19.170
Of course I value my life.

22:19.171 --> 22:20.071
Do you?

22:20.072 --> 22:22.572
Your actions
would indicate otherwise.

22:22.607 --> 22:26.771
I'm gonna tell you what you are
apparently dying to know.

22:26.845 --> 22:29.345
Your friend, Daniel Hecht,

22:29.348 --> 22:33.045
David McNeil's wife, Susan,
Eloise Kurtz.

22:33.118 --> 22:35.386
They were all innocent victims.

22:35.387 --> 22:39.983
Their deaths were unfortunate.
A matter of circumstance.

22:41.393 --> 22:43.987
Now, the only
remaining question

22:44.062 --> 22:46.963
is whether
the story ends there

22:47.032 --> 22:50.160
or whether it includes
other innocent victims.

22:53.638 --> 22:58.007
Amy Tippin,
3723 East Conestoga Way.

23:00.345 --> 23:05.009
Robert and Patsy Tippin,
63064 Shulman Way.

23:08.687 --> 23:11.155
Sydney Bristow,
4250 Cochran Street.

23:11.156 --> 23:13.656
Stop, stop. I understand.

23:17.095 --> 23:19.029
This will be
your only warning.

23:44.689 --> 23:47.189
Mr. Sloane.

23:48.059 --> 23:49.260
Yes?

23:49.261 --> 23:51.695
I've questioned everyone
from the boat.

23:51.696 --> 23:55.291
The captain is a civilian.
He doesn't know anything.

23:56.968 --> 23:59.468
Kill him.

23:59.571 --> 24:02.071
Yes, sir.

24:07.012 --> 24:08.012
Hello?

24:08.013 --> 24:10.181
Sydney, it's Emily.

24:10.182 --> 24:11.449
Hi.

24:11.450 --> 24:14.010
Listen, I wanted
to thank you for calling.

24:14.085 --> 24:15.953
You have no idea
how much that meant.

24:15.954 --> 24:17.421
You don't have to thank me.

24:17.422 --> 24:18.722
I do.

24:18.723 --> 24:21.886
I woke up this morning
feeling strong.

24:21.960 --> 24:24.827
I was curious
if you were free for dinner.

24:24.896 --> 24:25.663
Tonight?

24:25.664 --> 24:28.164
Bring a friend. Please?

24:29.000 --> 24:31.500
And you accepted?

24:32.003 --> 24:33.737
Not at first.

24:33.738 --> 24:36.571
But Emily's sick.
I couldn't say no.

24:38.276 --> 24:40.776
I knew you wanted me
to anyway.

24:42.714 --> 24:45.214
Here.

24:47.819 --> 24:49.920
- This is a bug?
- It's good, huh?

24:49.921 --> 24:51.422
You should see
the guys who make it.

24:51.423 --> 24:53.357
It's like
they've never seen sunlight.

24:53.358 --> 24:54.825
You should meet Marshall.

24:54.826 --> 24:56.427
Where do you want this?

24:56.428 --> 24:58.062
Sloane's got an office
in his home.

24:58.063 --> 25:00.064
That's where we want it.

25:00.065 --> 25:02.533
Especially now that SD-6
has the Rambaldi book.

25:02.534 --> 25:05.034
The CIA's been studying
those photos you took.

25:05.070 --> 25:06.337
They turned out all right?

25:06.338 --> 25:08.239
There's one blank page.

25:08.240 --> 25:09.840
Well, CIA Sci-Tech says

25:09.841 --> 25:11.408
that of the few Rambaldi
documents they've recovered,

25:11.409 --> 25:14.242
the 47 th page is always
particularly significant.

25:14.312 --> 25:16.747
This blank page was number 47.

25:16.748 --> 25:18.015
Your father's strategizing

25:18.016 --> 25:19.850
on how to get it
out of SD-6 analysis,

25:19.851 --> 25:22.286
replace it with a counterfeit,
but in the meantime,

25:22.287 --> 25:24.915
we're just hoping to
learn something with that bug.

25:25.457 --> 25:27.957
Okay.

25:28.960 --> 25:31.656
You said Emily
invited you and a friend?

25:31.730 --> 25:34.230
Mm-hmm.

25:34.366 --> 25:36.100
You taking anyone?

25:50.982 --> 25:52.683
Hello?

25:52.684 --> 25:54.718
What are you doing?

25:54.719 --> 25:55.786
Syd?

25:55.787 --> 25:57.154
Are you sleeping?

25:57.155 --> 25:59.749
Uh, no.

25:59.824 --> 26:02.657
I'm, uh...
I'm working.

26:02.727 --> 26:05.162
Are you all right?
You sound like hell.

26:05.163 --> 26:07.097
Yeah, I'm fine.

26:07.098 --> 26:10.124
How you doing?

26:10.201 --> 26:12.336
You're gonna kill me.

26:12.337 --> 26:13.938
Why?

26:13.939 --> 26:16.908
I know we talked about
going to "North by Northwest,"

26:16.975 --> 26:19.109
but there's this dinner
at my boss's house.

26:19.110 --> 26:21.610
I can't get out of it.

26:25.617 --> 26:27.084
You're mad.

26:27.085 --> 26:29.679
Uh, no, no.

26:31.289 --> 26:33.985
I got to go
to a meeting, though.

26:35.627 --> 26:36.794
Will you come with me?

26:36.795 --> 26:38.729
They said
I could bring a guest.

26:38.730 --> 26:41.230
Will you be my guest?

27:01.753 --> 27:03.954
Will you please
tell me what happened?

27:03.955 --> 27:07.118
I told you
I don't want to talk about it.

27:08.393 --> 27:10.893
Your bruise looks pretty bad.

27:12.464 --> 27:15.160
Well, you know what?

27:15.233 --> 27:17.534
You're gonna have to
come to my place.

27:17.535 --> 27:20.035
I'll make you
a big bowl of ashishta.

27:20.138 --> 27:23.198
It's a noodle soup that
my grandmother used to make.

27:23.308 --> 27:25.476
You know what?
You have to meet her.

27:25.477 --> 27:27.811
You're gonna love her.

27:27.812 --> 27:29.780
Jenny, I think you're great.

27:29.781 --> 27:32.306
You're smart
and you're beautiful.

27:32.384 --> 27:34.518
I think we've had a lot of fun.

27:34.519 --> 27:37.019
But you and I...

27:37.222 --> 27:39.722
I just don't think
that we...

27:44.162 --> 27:46.497
Are you breaking up with me?

27:46.498 --> 27:50.525
I drive all the way out here
with a broken radio,

27:50.602 --> 27:52.169
and you're gonna
break up with me?

27:52.170 --> 27:54.371
- That's not fair.
- Why don't you call Sydney?

27:54.372 --> 27:56.774
Sydney's not my assistant.
You work for me.

27:56.775 --> 27:58.409
Not anymore. Get out.

27:58.410 --> 27:59.977
"Get out"?

27:59.978 --> 28:01.478
I am not kidding.

28:01.479 --> 28:03.514
Where the hell are we?
We're nowhere.

28:03.515 --> 28:06.015
No, no.
You're nowhere. Get out.

28:07.385 --> 28:09.885
Fine.

28:18.697 --> 28:20.364
"Dear Aunt Stephanie...

28:20.365 --> 28:22.499
unfortunately,
as my mom has informed you,

28:22.500 --> 28:24.535
the wedding is off.

28:24.536 --> 28:26.370
So I am returning
your kind gift

28:26.371 --> 28:28.572
of a coffee maker because,
as it turns out,

28:28.573 --> 28:30.774
the man to whom I was engaged

28:30.775 --> 28:33.243
is a deceitful, two-faced,
sex-crazed jackass.

28:33.244 --> 28:35.906
All my love, Francie. "

28:35.980 --> 28:37.448
It's not too harsh.

28:37.449 --> 28:40.441
I want to read you one more.

28:42.854 --> 28:43.854
Hello?

28:43.855 --> 28:45.122
Joey's Pizza?

28:45.123 --> 28:47.853
This is Joey's Pizza.
You want to hear our specials?

28:47.926 --> 28:50.060
Hello?

28:50.061 --> 28:52.463
Seriously, we need to think
about changing our number.

28:52.464 --> 28:54.964
I know.

28:56.501 --> 28:59.001
Thank you.

28:59.571 --> 29:01.805
I'm going to get a bottle
of wine for tonight.

29:01.806 --> 29:03.307
Do you need anything?

29:03.308 --> 29:05.808
No, thanks.

29:17.388 --> 29:18.789
Hey.

29:18.790 --> 29:20.824
Sloane brought
the Rambaldi book home.

29:20.825 --> 29:23.227
I met with him earlier.
He showed me the book.

29:23.228 --> 29:24.628
He was so taken
by what he'd seen,

29:24.629 --> 29:26.263
he wanted to show it
to you himself.

29:26.264 --> 29:27.498
He brought it to his house?

29:27.499 --> 29:28.699
Yes.
It'll be there tonight.

29:28.700 --> 29:31.794
Why didn't he just wait
until I was at SD-6 on Monday?

29:31.870 --> 29:34.138
An Alliance courier
is en route to Los Angeles.

29:34.139 --> 29:35.873
They're taking the book
to Germany.

29:35.874 --> 29:37.641
They have a cluster of labs
in Munich.

29:37.642 --> 29:39.543
Advanced analysis
they can't perform here.

29:39.544 --> 29:42.012
Wait a minute.
The blank page.

29:42.013 --> 29:43.647
You want me to make a switch.

29:43.648 --> 29:44.782
If we don't do it tonight,

29:44.783 --> 29:46.150
the courier will arrive
in the morning,

29:46.151 --> 29:47.985
we'll lose our shot
at getting that page.

29:47.986 --> 29:49.987
Doesn't this seem
a little risky to you?

29:49.988 --> 29:52.089
Making a move like this
at Sloane's house,

29:52.090 --> 29:54.091
while he's there,
without backup.

29:54.092 --> 29:56.426
You will have backup.
Your father's going, too.

29:56.427 --> 29:57.928
I can help you tonight.

29:57.929 --> 30:00.454
Emily believes that her husband
is C.O.O. Of the bank.

30:00.532 --> 30:02.032
If he wants to show you
the book,

30:02.033 --> 30:03.834
he'll do that in private,
in his office.

30:03.835 --> 30:06.335
Where you want me
to plant the bug.

30:06.337 --> 30:08.837
If that's where the book is,
it could be ideal.

30:08.873 --> 30:11.275
During dinner, Vaughn
will call your cellphone

30:11.276 --> 30:12.676
posing as a friend in need.

30:12.677 --> 30:14.812
You'll excuse yourself,
go to Sloane's office,

30:14.813 --> 30:16.713
get into his safe,
and make the switch.

30:16.714 --> 30:18.882
Sloane's vault is
an advanced cushion model.

30:18.883 --> 30:22.910
The guys who made the paper-clip
bug came up with this.

30:22.987 --> 30:25.422
It overrides the circuitry.

30:25.423 --> 30:26.657
Tricks the safe into believing

30:26.658 --> 30:28.992
you entered
the correct combination.

30:28.993 --> 30:32.326
They say it's bitchin',
so I'm assuming it's bitchin'.

30:32.397 --> 30:34.631
I don't know about this plan.

30:34.632 --> 30:38.193
Not only does it
put me in danger, and you...

30:38.269 --> 30:40.437
but I'm taking Will tonight.

30:40.438 --> 30:42.105
You're doing what?

30:42.106 --> 30:43.707
Yeah.

30:43.708 --> 30:46.541
Emily told me
to bring someone. Why?

30:46.611 --> 30:48.879
Nothing.

30:48.880 --> 30:51.542
I should leave.
I'll see you there.

30:57.188 --> 30:59.816
If you feel you can make
the switch, do it.

30:59.891 --> 31:02.391
Just use your discretion.

31:03.328 --> 31:04.728
So, you're taking Will?

31:04.729 --> 31:07.229
Yeah.

31:10.134 --> 31:12.634
You look really pretty.

31:13.671 --> 31:16.171
Thank you.

31:27.518 --> 31:29.720
Oh, Sydney.

31:29.721 --> 31:32.189
- Hi.
- I'm so glad you're here.

31:32.190 --> 31:33.657
Hey, these are for you.

31:33.658 --> 31:34.825
- Oh, good.
- You look beautiful.

31:34.826 --> 31:37.386
Oh, thank you.
You look fantastic.

31:37.462 --> 31:39.696
I want you to meet
my friend Will Tippin.

31:39.697 --> 31:41.131
And this is Emily.

31:41.132 --> 31:42.599
How do you do?
I'm pleased to meet you.

31:42.600 --> 31:45.100
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Please come in.

31:47.005 --> 31:49.505
Wow.

31:49.974 --> 31:52.636
- I believe you know each other.
- Sure, we met.

31:52.710 --> 31:53.810
- Good to see you.
- You too.

31:53.811 --> 31:56.405
Sydney's telling me you're doing
analysis for the bank.

31:56.481 --> 31:58.715
Strategy.
Investment strategy.

31:58.716 --> 32:00.651
Arvin made me an offer
I couldn't refuse.

32:00.652 --> 32:02.252
That sounds like my husband.

32:02.253 --> 32:04.753
Sydney.

32:05.456 --> 32:07.291
I'm so glad you came.

32:07.292 --> 32:10.159
Me too.
This is my friend Will Tippin.

32:10.228 --> 32:11.395
Arvin Sloane.

32:11.396 --> 32:12.396
Hey.

32:12.397 --> 32:14.897
Hey. Nice to meet you.

32:15.500 --> 32:17.567
Yeah, nice to meet you, too.

32:17.568 --> 32:19.670
Sydney, I want
to show you something.

32:19.671 --> 32:21.738
And, Emily, this is
the only business

32:21.739 --> 32:24.239
we'll do this evening.

32:27.011 --> 32:29.112
Can I get you
anything to drink?

32:29.113 --> 32:31.515
Yes, yes.
Anything would be great.

32:31.516 --> 32:34.016
Okay, great. Come in.

32:34.419 --> 32:36.853
I didn't get a chance
to tell you how proud I am

32:36.854 --> 32:39.289
of the work you did in Tunisia.

32:39.290 --> 32:40.857
I was just doing my job.

32:40.858 --> 32:44.919
Well, you will find,
as you get older,

32:44.996 --> 32:49.365
how difficult it is to find
people who just do their job.

32:49.434 --> 32:52.597
A courier is picking this up
tomorrow morning for analysis.

32:52.704 --> 32:53.770
Taking it where?

32:53.771 --> 32:56.271
England.

32:56.774 --> 32:59.299
I just wanted you to see it.

32:59.410 --> 33:02.140
I didn't know if you had
a chance to look at it...

33:04.315 --> 33:06.350
...to really examine it.

33:06.351 --> 33:08.151
No, I didn't open it.

33:08.152 --> 33:11.485
Some of the text is Italian.

33:12.557 --> 33:14.858
But most of it is in code.

33:14.859 --> 33:17.487
Code we haven't been able
to break.

33:18.896 --> 33:21.626
Who was this man, Sydney?

33:21.699 --> 33:23.800
What did he see?

33:23.801 --> 33:25.836
What did Rambaldi see?

33:25.837 --> 33:27.838
Those who know about him...

33:27.839 --> 33:31.775
various agencies,
a few in the private sector...

33:31.843 --> 33:35.040
they're spending millions
to answer these questions.

33:35.113 --> 33:37.114
Millions.

33:37.115 --> 33:39.948
Men would die for this book.

33:41.853 --> 33:44.353
Men have died.

33:45.423 --> 33:48.187
You know, Sydney,
the work we're doing here...

33:48.259 --> 33:50.560
trying to figure out
who Rambaldi was,

33:50.561 --> 33:53.030
what he was working on...

33:53.031 --> 33:56.296
is becoming
an obsession for me.

33:56.367 --> 33:59.393
I'm still not sure
I'm a believer.

34:00.538 --> 34:03.038
Neither was I.

34:05.276 --> 34:07.277
Neither was I.

34:07.278 --> 34:08.344
Wait a minute.

34:08.346 --> 34:12.646
You wrote the article about
the fruit picker from La Venta?

34:12.717 --> 34:16.312
Yeah, I did.
I can't believe you read that.

34:16.387 --> 34:18.621
This is so funny.
I told you about this.

34:18.623 --> 34:20.891
There was a poll
in the newspaper.

34:20.891 --> 34:22.259
I voted for you.

34:22.260 --> 34:24.594
You're kidding me.
I just won that.

34:24.594 --> 34:26.963
You did?
Well, you deserved it.

34:26.964 --> 34:29.433
That story made me cry.

34:29.434 --> 34:31.368
It just stayed with me.

34:31.369 --> 34:32.936
Yeah, well,
that guy was amazing.

34:32.937 --> 34:35.906
The story was about
this man Luis Maroma.

34:35.973 --> 34:38.275
He was a fruit picker
from Mexico.

34:38.275 --> 34:41.109
Illegal immigrant
living in Los Angeles.

34:41.179 --> 34:44.114
He worked for a man who was...

34:44.181 --> 34:46.083
basically a slave driver.

34:46.083 --> 34:48.418
No, he was a slave driver.

34:48.418 --> 34:50.853
The conditions
these poor people lived in...

34:50.855 --> 34:54.018
18 sleeping in every room.
One bathroom.

34:54.092 --> 34:55.992
They were all undernourished.

34:55.993 --> 34:58.128
If anyone got sick,
there was no health care.

34:58.129 --> 35:00.564
Anyway, Maroma was one
of these workers

35:00.565 --> 35:02.732
smuggled in from Mexico.

35:02.733 --> 35:05.233
Their boss was a monster.

35:05.269 --> 35:06.269
He was the devil.

35:06.270 --> 35:08.605
He was literally the devil.

35:08.606 --> 35:10.607
How's that?

35:10.608 --> 35:12.742
Well, if you spoke out
against him,

35:12.743 --> 35:15.243
if you tried to leave,
he'd have you killed.

35:16.481 --> 35:19.917
Now, the other workers
didn't know what they could do,

35:19.984 --> 35:22.419
but Luis Maroma could read.

35:22.420 --> 35:23.954
He started to teach
the others to read.

35:23.955 --> 35:26.056
He would find articles
in the newspapers

35:26.057 --> 35:27.858
that they were wrapping
the fruit in.

35:27.859 --> 35:29.993
Articles that taught them
about their rights,

35:29.994 --> 35:31.862
about what was right and wrong.

35:31.863 --> 35:36.061
Eventually, he led a revolt
against this guy.

35:38.136 --> 35:41.071
I'm gonna cry again
just talking about it.

35:41.139 --> 35:42.806
What was amazing was,
this man had no future.

35:42.807 --> 35:44.908
He was caught
in a horrible position.

35:44.909 --> 35:46.943
Working for the worst
person in the world.

35:46.944 --> 35:51.074
But he was resourceful,
and he was smart.

35:51.149 --> 35:53.649
And today
he's going to college.

35:53.651 --> 35:56.176
And the monster
he worked for is in prison,

35:56.254 --> 35:58.754
rotting where he belongs.

35:59.957 --> 36:02.858
Wow, that's
an incredible story.

36:05.463 --> 36:07.963
Emily?

36:09.433 --> 36:11.933
Emily, are you all right?

36:13.404 --> 36:15.005
Mmm.

36:15.006 --> 36:17.440
I'm fine. I'm fine.

36:17.441 --> 36:19.941
I'm sorry.

36:20.645 --> 36:24.513
I'm still adjusting to
this new medication.

36:24.582 --> 36:27.082
It's nothing.

36:27.752 --> 36:29.753
Excuse me.

36:29.754 --> 36:32.254
Sorry.

36:33.291 --> 36:35.791
Hello?

36:36.027 --> 36:37.527
Hi, it's Francie.

36:37.528 --> 36:39.930
- Francie.
- Oh.

36:39.931 --> 36:43.423
Excuse me.
I have to take this call.

36:43.501 --> 36:44.868
I'm sorry.

36:44.869 --> 36:47.369
Hey, sweetie.

36:54.579 --> 36:57.139
Okay, I'm in.
I'll see you at the dead drop.

37:03.054 --> 37:05.455
So, Will...

37:05.456 --> 37:07.956
what story are you working on?

37:08.926 --> 37:10.560
I have a few irons
in the fire.

37:10.561 --> 37:11.995
Really?

37:11.996 --> 37:14.496
What kind of irons?

37:20.304 --> 37:22.439
Jack, can I get you
some more wine?

37:22.440 --> 37:24.040
- Please, let me get it.
- You stay there.

37:24.041 --> 37:26.443
I'll get it.
I know where the wine cellar is.

37:26.444 --> 37:29.709
Mmm. This lamb's fantastic.

37:57.108 --> 37:58.775
Oh, this?
I got hit playing basketball.

37:58.776 --> 37:59.809
How's this?

37:59.810 --> 38:03.109
Jack, that's a very nice wine,
but I have something special.

38:03.180 --> 38:04.481
A '78 Litsvage.

38:04.482 --> 38:05.749
I'll get it.

38:05.750 --> 38:07.384
No, please,
I know where it is.

38:07.385 --> 38:09.945
You sit down this time.
Please.

38:28.539 --> 38:31.039
You look pale.

38:31.042 --> 38:34.205
My friend. She's really
having a rough time.

38:35.112 --> 38:36.813
I see.

38:36.814 --> 38:38.715
Is there anything I can do?

38:38.716 --> 38:41.947
No. But thanks.

38:55.299 --> 38:58.063
I should have told you
last night about Tippin.

38:58.135 --> 39:00.503
He and McNeil traced the use
of McNeil's program

39:00.504 --> 39:02.639
to some of The Alliance's
shell companies.

39:02.640 --> 39:04.941
But I've dealt with Tippin.

39:04.942 --> 39:07.809
He won't be a problem
for us anymore.

39:07.878 --> 39:10.347
Security Section
told me what you did.

39:10.348 --> 39:12.848
You had me followed
by Security Section?

39:12.850 --> 39:15.350
They intercepted a phone call

39:15.353 --> 39:18.254
that Tippin made
to McNeil this morning.

39:18.322 --> 39:21.348
The two have scheduled
a meeting for this afternoon.

39:22.760 --> 39:24.561
I'm sure he's just going there

39:24.562 --> 39:27.326
to tell McNeil in person
that he's off the story.

39:27.398 --> 39:29.898
I'm not convinced of that,
so I sent someone.

39:30.668 --> 39:33.168
If by their conversation,
it becomes clear

39:33.204 --> 39:35.038
that Tippin has given up
this investigation,

39:35.039 --> 39:37.539
then, yes, I think
we should let him live.

39:38.576 --> 39:40.076
If, on the other hand,

39:40.077 --> 39:41.978
you haven't done the job
this time...

39:41.979 --> 39:43.146
Sorry.

39:43.147 --> 39:45.281
...then no one can.

39:45.282 --> 39:47.083
And I'm sure you'll agree

39:47.084 --> 39:50.178
that Tippin will need
to be taken care of.

39:58.529 --> 40:00.530
- Hey.
- Hi.

40:00.531 --> 40:01.531
I talked to Stoller.

40:01.532 --> 40:03.466
He's gonna check on
those companies.

40:03.467 --> 40:05.502
What happened to your face?

40:05.503 --> 40:06.970
We have to talk.

40:06.971 --> 40:11.271
When I first came here
and I asked you about SD-6,

40:11.342 --> 40:13.842
you told me not to pursue it.

40:15.012 --> 40:17.674
You said it was too dangerous.

40:17.748 --> 40:19.883
David, I think you were right.

40:19.884 --> 40:22.512
So why are you saying this
to me now?

40:22.586 --> 40:24.754
Did you talk to Christophe?
What did he say?

40:24.755 --> 40:27.588
- I didn't talk to Christophe.
- What's going on?

40:27.658 --> 40:30.354
I was kidnapped yesterday.

40:31.429 --> 40:34.159
I don't know
who they were, but...

40:34.231 --> 40:38.031
I'm assuming they work for SD-6.

40:38.102 --> 40:40.602
David, they threatened me.

40:40.671 --> 40:42.872
They told me to drop the story.

40:42.873 --> 40:44.274
What makes you think if you do,

40:44.275 --> 40:45.542
they're not gonna
kill you anyway?

40:45.543 --> 40:47.243
What choice do I have?

40:47.244 --> 40:49.078
You see it through.

40:49.079 --> 40:51.381
Understand this.

40:51.382 --> 40:54.874
The only way you can truly be
safe is to publish this story.

40:54.952 --> 40:57.512
Expose them in print.

40:57.588 --> 40:59.823
That's your
life insurance policy.

40:59.824 --> 41:02.554
Come on, Will.
We're close.

41:02.626 --> 41:05.028
You just give it a week...

41:05.029 --> 41:07.063
and we'll have something
for you to write about.

41:07.064 --> 41:11.023
One more week,
and they can't touch you.

41:23.247 --> 41:25.747
I can't. I'm sorry.

41:33.090 --> 41:36.059
Kelly went away
because of you.

41:36.126 --> 41:38.822
You convinced her that
you were gonna help me get out.

41:38.896 --> 41:41.297
You don't have the choice
to back out on me.

41:41.298 --> 41:43.433
David...

41:43.434 --> 41:46.528
I hate myself
for letting you down, okay?

41:47.571 --> 41:48.905
But right now I'm you.

41:48.906 --> 41:54.139
I'm exactly where you were
before your wife was killed.

41:54.211 --> 41:57.510
Now, if I do
what you suggest...

41:57.581 --> 42:00.948
David, they're gonna
kill my family...

42:01.018 --> 42:02.886
my friends.

42:02.887 --> 42:06.118
If you could go back,
if you could change it,

42:06.190 --> 42:08.954
you wouldn't hesitate,
would you?

42:12.363 --> 42:14.863
I'm sorry.

42:28.479 --> 42:29.245
Call Driscoll.

42:29.246 --> 42:31.514
Tell him I got his e-mail,
that he's a sick man,

42:31.515 --> 42:33.016
and that we have the rink
for tomorrow night.

42:33.017 --> 42:34.384
Mr. Vaughn?

42:34.385 --> 42:35.618
Yeah? I'm late for a meeting.

42:35.619 --> 42:37.253
You're gonna want
to cancel that meeting.

42:37.254 --> 42:40.189
I'm Officer Cohen
with Sci-Tech.

42:40.257 --> 42:42.625
We figured out how to read
the Rambaldi document.

42:42.626 --> 42:45.493
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

42:57.775 --> 43:00.275
Cancel my meeting.

43:07.051 --> 43:09.085
I came as fast as I could.

43:09.086 --> 43:10.620
Vaughn, what's up?

43:10.621 --> 43:12.989
Remember that vial of liquid

43:12.990 --> 43:14.857
Cole was after
in the SD-6 vault?

43:14.858 --> 43:16.159
Yeah, of course.

43:16.160 --> 43:20.119
We used it on the blank page
to get the ink to show up.

43:20.197 --> 43:22.432
So, it worked?

43:22.433 --> 43:24.701
Yeah.

43:24.702 --> 43:27.202
So, what is it?

43:27.871 --> 43:30.073
Look, we're not sure.

43:30.074 --> 43:32.508
We don't know what it means.

43:32.509 --> 43:34.544
That's sort of the problem.

43:34.545 --> 43:38.709
Okay, so you're acting
really freaky.

43:40.050 --> 43:43.417
I have the page with me,
and I'd like you to see it.

43:44.822 --> 43:47.322
Okay.
