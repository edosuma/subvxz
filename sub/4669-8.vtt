This is ridiculous.

You can't hold me on this ship!

00:07.230 --> 00:09.304
I recognize and respect your position, sir,

00:09.366 --> 00:10.699
but I am under orders.

00:10.701 --> 00:12.234
This is an outrage.
Where are you taking me?

00:12.236 --> 00:14.619
Sir, please, this will be a lot
easier if you don't resist.

00:14.621 --> 00:15.954
Don't resist?

00:15.956 --> 00:17.455
I'm the President of the United States,

00:17.457 --> 00:19.124
and this is treason!

00:21.234 --> 00:24.629
Did he say "President
of the United States"?

00:24.631 --> 00:26.131
Rachel: Where is Niels?

00:26.133 --> 00:28.650
Recovering in the medical bay.

00:28.652 --> 00:30.252
He'll be in a medically induced coma

00:30.254 --> 00:31.419
for at least 24 hours.

00:31.421 --> 00:32.971
How did he get to America?

00:32.973 --> 00:35.757
How did he find his way to the immunes?

00:36.593 --> 00:38.643
Don't know yet.

00:38.645 --> 00:40.512
That's something I'll ask the President.

00:40.514 --> 00:41.763
Who you believe is one of them?

00:41.765 --> 00:43.765
He seems to think so.

00:44.768 --> 00:47.352
We're gonna try and change that.

00:47.354 --> 00:49.821
Senator: <i>The Department of Housing

<i>and that the State should be charged
with their own infrastructure...</i>

interrupting you, Mr. Senator.</i>

01:01.501 --> 01:03.168
<i>But since I already know
what you're going to say,</i>

01:03.170 --> 01:04.786
<i>let me just cut to the heart of the matter.</i>

01:04.788 --> 01:06.621
<i>It is a sadly misunderstood idea</i>

01:06.623 --> 01:09.541
<i>that we have somehow graduated
from our obligations</i>

01:09.543 --> 01:11.876
<i>of developing
this country's infrastructure.</i>

01:26.977 --> 01:28.143
How much does the crew know?

01:28.145 --> 01:30.028
They know we've got the President.

01:30.030 --> 01:32.647
Some of them know
he didn't quite come willingly.

01:32.649 --> 01:34.149
And that he was with the immunes?

01:34.151 --> 01:37.485
No. We'll have to turn him
quickly to avoid that question.

01:37.487 --> 01:38.703
Yeah, well, in my mind,

01:38.705 --> 01:40.155
if he doesn't walk out of that room

01:40.157 --> 01:42.324
committed to our cause by sunrise tomorrow,

01:42.326 --> 01:45.460
we'll never convince our crew he's worthy
of being followed.

01:45.462 --> 01:48.663
This is about more than just the crew.

01:48.665 --> 01:50.131
The country needs a leader.

01:50.133 --> 01:50.965
Yeah.

And if the first 200 people

who come in contact with him
think he's tainted,

01:55.505 --> 01:57.005

Wanted us to get acquainted
till he gets here.

You <i> are</i> aware that kidnapping
the President of the United States

is a federal offense, punishable by death?

03:00.654 --> 03:03.288
The Captain was under the
impression he was <i> rescuing</i> you.

At gunpoint, against my will?

03:05.125 --> 03:06.875

You don't need to tell me <i> anything.</i>

03:25.145 --> 03:27.228
These were her orders to us.

President Geller: <i>Morning, Commander.</i>

03:29.766 --> 03:33.818

04:09.473 --> 04:11.439
We came home.

04:11.441 --> 04:15.477
Found things not quite
as hospitable as we'd hoped.

04:15.479 --> 04:17.812
No infrastructure...

04:17.814 --> 04:21.065
No government, no orders.

04:21.067 --> 04:22.283
So we went to the White House,

04:22.285 --> 04:23.651
and we were able to get our hands

04:23.653 --> 04:25.320
on many of the Presidential
files and directives.

we sent doses around the country
and to Europe,

as we were ordered to do.

05:31.555 --> 05:35.056
The project to mass-produce
the cure was well under way,

11:30.528 --> 11:34.446
- The labs, our scientists...
- Your X.O. Tried to sell me on that.

11:34.448 --> 11:36.315
You think we manufactured that video?

11:36.317 --> 11:38.901
You went to great lengths
to bring me on this ship.

11:38.903 --> 11:41.737
Doctoring a video would not be
particularly difficult.

11:41.739 --> 11:44.706
According to Sean,
you're the chosen, right?

11:45.459 --> 11:47.743
I would think a ship carrying the cure,

11:47.745 --> 11:50.796
labs trying to manufacture
that cure, well...

11:51.882 --> 11:54.550
...that would be the greatest
threat possible to him.

11:54.552 --> 11:56.718
We are strong because of our strength.

11:56.720 --> 11:59.087
We don't need to destroy anyone else.

11:59.089 --> 12:00.472
So, you believe we have the cure?

12:00.474 --> 12:03.308
- I believe you <i> think</i> you do.
- And you've seen our instructions

12:03.310 --> 12:05.677
from the President,
the Secretary of the Navy?

12:05.679 --> 12:08.514
I've seen them. They're from months ago.
They're obsolete.

12:08.516 --> 12:12.100
Well, that leaves me in a bit of a bind.

12:12.102 --> 12:16.355
We have standing orders from
the previous administration...

12:16.357 --> 12:19.575
Orders that are consistent
with national protocols...

12:19.577 --> 12:24.246
And then we have <i> you,</i> the new President,

12:24.248 --> 12:26.165
issuing orders that don't seem to be

12:26.167 --> 12:27.783
in the national interest at all.

12:27.785 --> 12:31.286
The national interest is saving
what's left of this country.

12:31.288 --> 12:34.790
Sean Ramsey and our movement give the
country the best chance at that.

12:34.792 --> 12:36.708
Convince me.

12:39.346 --> 12:41.380
Tell me how it all happened...

12:41.382 --> 12:43.382
How you came to this point,

12:43.384 --> 12:47.135
why you're so sure of what you believe.

12:48.389 --> 12:51.356
Is he trying to turn him or get the intel?

12:51.358 --> 12:53.108
<i>Come on, Mr. President.</i>

12:53.110 --> 12:56.395
You want off this ship,

12:56.397 --> 12:58.730
you're gonna have to convince me.

13:06.957 --> 13:09.875
<i>The outbreak had just started in Earnest,</i>

13:09.877 --> 13:11.460
in the South.

13:11.462 --> 13:15.797
'Course, that was before anyone
knew how bad it would become.

13:17.968 --> 13:19.968
The President sent me down to Tallahassee

13:19.970 --> 13:23.138
to create quarantine areas
and organize safe zones.

13:23.140 --> 13:26.425
It was only supposed to be
for a week or so, but then...

13:26.427 --> 13:30.312
Things started spiraling
out of control very quickly.

13:30.314 --> 13:32.598
It was untenable
for me to leave the region.

13:32.600 --> 13:35.400
Within a month, the entire
country was enveloped.

13:35.402 --> 13:37.986
I can't begin to imagine.

13:37.988 --> 13:40.239
No. You can't.

13:42.109 --> 13:43.408
And your family?

13:44.411 --> 13:46.194
They were with me.

13:46.196 --> 13:47.913
But not immune?

13:47.915 --> 13:50.999
Safe zones were created
to protect the people.

13:51.001 --> 13:53.702
But there wasn't a reliable test
for the virus,

13:53.704 --> 13:56.955
and early symptoms were very subtle.
We couldn't stop it.

13:56.957 --> 13:59.708
And how did you discover
that you were immune?

13:59.710 --> 14:01.877
We were in one of
the safe zones I created...

14:01.879 --> 14:04.263
Doak Stadium, where
the Seminoles used to play?

14:04.265 --> 14:08.016
- Sure.
- Well, when you look around

14:08.018 --> 14:11.887
and you see 20,000 people dead
and only a handful alive,

14:11.889 --> 14:15.357
you start to get the feeling
that maybe you're special,

14:15.359 --> 14:17.893
except not in any way you'd <i> want</i> to be...

14:17.895 --> 14:21.613
Not when your children are
bleeding out of their eyeballs.

14:23.734 --> 14:25.901
And Sean?

14:25.903 --> 14:27.986
How did you find your way to him?

14:27.988 --> 14:29.738
I only wanted to die.

14:29.740 --> 14:31.740
For three weeks, I walked around

14:31.742 --> 14:33.909
exposing myself to anyone who was sick.

14:33.911 --> 14:36.545
I thought maybe that there was
a different strain,

14:36.547 --> 14:39.047
maybe there was some other way
that I could catch it.

14:39.049 --> 14:43.752
One day, I stumbled upon
a group of survivors.

14:43.754 --> 14:45.837
Except they weren't acting
like everybody else.

14:45.839 --> 14:49.091
They didn't have that rabid look
in their eyes...

14:49.093 --> 14:51.393
The desperation, the loss.

14:52.646 --> 14:55.897
They had a sense of purpose, unity...

14:55.899 --> 14:57.599
Hope, even.

14:57.601 --> 15:00.152
And I learned they were all immune

15:00.154 --> 15:02.404
and that I was one of them.

15:03.607 --> 15:05.991
And I slept for the first time in weeks.

15:05.993 --> 15:08.110
I held food down,

15:08.112 --> 15:09.828
<i>and I started to see</i>

15:09.830 --> 15:12.831
<i>that there's more
than loss and desperation...</i>

15:12.833 --> 15:15.667
That there's a future,
a way to start again.

15:15.669 --> 15:19.538
They showed me how
the movement began in Europe...

15:19.540 --> 15:23.291
That from the ashes, they were once
again building a civilization.

15:23.293 --> 15:24.626
And I realized,

15:24.628 --> 15:27.963
if I'm the surviving member of the
Cabinet, if I'm the President,

15:27.965 --> 15:30.799
I can be a part of making it happen <i> here.</i>

15:30.801 --> 15:33.018
Because one thing was clear...

15:33.020 --> 15:35.887
Sean Ramsey may not be what we asked for,

15:35.889 --> 15:38.390
but he was what was given to us,

15:38.392 --> 15:41.526
and his vision is what's saving the world.

15:42.646 --> 15:45.313
And what exactly is his vision?

15:45.315 --> 15:48.483
Immunes remain together, united.

15:48.485 --> 15:50.318
Create a new line of the human race,

15:50.320 --> 15:52.237
strong enough to withstand any plague.

15:52.239 --> 15:53.822
A master race?

15:53.824 --> 15:55.490
Yeah, well, that's
a pretty antiquated view of it.

15:55.492 --> 15:57.042
That's what it is.

15:57.044 --> 15:59.044
I know it sounds cutthroat,
but there's a deep logic to it.

15:59.046 --> 16:00.495
And that is...?

16:00.497 --> 16:03.331
Non-immunes will eventually
bring down the rest of you

16:03.333 --> 16:06.885
if you co-mingle, if you procreate?

16:06.887 --> 16:08.970
How many of you
are even left on this planet?

16:08.972 --> 16:11.473
How spread out are you? We
have to protect ourselves...

16:11.475 --> 16:15.330
The people strong enough to survive. That's
Darwin. That's the Law of the Jungle.

16:15.332 --> 16:16.311
That's biblical.

16:16.313 --> 16:18.847
<i>Some people around here</i>
<i>feel that</i> this <i> is the Ark.</i>

16:18.849 --> 16:20.732
Because you have the cure?

16:20.734 --> 16:23.935
How long do you think it will last
before the virus mutates again?

16:23.937 --> 16:25.020
The virus is stabilized.

16:25.022 --> 16:26.772
Who do you think you're talking to?

16:26.774 --> 16:28.907
I had access to
the top government scientists.

16:28.909 --> 16:31.276
I saw the virus mutate
five, six times a month.

16:31.278 --> 16:33.412
That was August.

16:33.414 --> 16:34.613
It's stabilized now.

16:34.615 --> 16:36.415
- Says who?
- Says <i> our</i> scientist.

16:36.417 --> 16:37.833
Dr. Scott?

16:37.835 --> 16:39.618
Most people think she's a quack.

16:39.620 --> 16:41.503
She is <i> not</i> a quack.

16:41.505 --> 16:43.422
Well...

16:43.424 --> 16:45.373
Sean's scientists say something different.

16:45.375 --> 16:47.125
I'm not sure why I should believe yours.

16:47.127 --> 16:49.845
Even if they're right...

16:49.847 --> 16:53.181
What makes you think you won't
fall prey to the next strand?

16:53.183 --> 16:56.435
Or the next polio or smallpox or swine flu?

16:56.437 --> 16:58.386
Because they've tested our blood.

16:58.388 --> 17:00.555
We have certain antibodies, proteins,

17:00.557 --> 17:03.058
- coagulates that make us...
- What?

17:04.394 --> 17:06.194
Invincible?

17:06.195 --> 17:09.781
Best equipped
to carry the torch for humanity.

17:09.782 --> 17:12.400
It's a responsibility,
and we don't take it lightly.

17:12.402 --> 17:14.903
- Responsibility?
<i>- That's right... responsibility.</i>

17:14.905 --> 17:16.621
This is going off the rails.

17:16.623 --> 17:18.205
I don't know, sir.

17:18.208 --> 17:20.742
And if I were to let you go,
send you back to the Ramseys,

17:20.743 --> 17:22.577
what would your game plan be then?

17:22.579 --> 17:25.247
You already heard...
I'm going to New Orleans.

17:25.249 --> 17:27.465
I did hear that. What I don't know is why.

17:27.468 --> 17:29.668
Okay, okay.

17:29.670 --> 17:32.921
<i>After Katrina, the government swore
</i> we'd never let it happen again.

17:32.923 --> 17:34.973
It has the largest
pumping station on the planet,

17:34.975 --> 17:38.093
plus a 2-mile wall
that can seal off the channel,

17:38.095 --> 17:40.595
plus huge stores of food, medicine,

17:40.597 --> 17:43.932
an independent hydroelectric
grid, lots of boats.

17:43.934 --> 17:46.935
It's best place
to start rebuilding the country.

17:50.741 --> 17:52.824
And the people surviving there,

17:52.826 --> 17:55.577
the ones who aren't immune...

17:55.579 --> 17:57.696
What will the Ramseys do with them?

17:57.698 --> 18:00.282
- "Do with them"?
- I have to imagine it's pretty hard

18:00.284 --> 18:02.417
to start a master race
of naturally immune demigods

18:02.419 --> 18:06.421
with all those pesky non-immune
survivors hanging around.

18:06.623 --> 18:08.823
We'll create our own societies.

18:08.825 --> 18:11.326
Yours will die out on their own.

18:11.328 --> 18:14.245
- That what he said?
- That's what will happen.

18:14.247 --> 18:17.549
- So no killing?
- No... no killing,

18:17.551 --> 18:20.418
despite what you think
you heard on that tape.

18:20.420 --> 18:23.805
How do you know Sean won't go
to New Orleans without you?

18:23.807 --> 18:26.307
- He wouldn't.
- How do you know?

18:26.309 --> 18:28.343
You just met the guy three days ago.

18:28.345 --> 18:30.261
Because we've been planning this
for months.

18:30.263 --> 18:33.148
- He came to America for <i> me.</i>
- For months?

18:33.150 --> 18:35.483
How? How'd you communicate?

18:35.485 --> 18:37.068
You don't really think
I'm gonna tell you that?

18:37.070 --> 18:38.520
I'm not against you, Mr. President.

18:38.522 --> 18:40.522
I'm just trying to figure out
how all of this evolved.

18:40.524 --> 18:43.775
American immunes need an American
to lead them. That's how.

18:43.777 --> 18:46.111
- That's what he tells you, isn't it?
- That's right. It's true.

18:46.113 --> 18:48.029
Well, then, maybe you can tell me

18:48.031 --> 18:50.832
why our sonar operators
are picking up Ramsey's sub

18:50.834 --> 18:53.618
heading West...
To New Orleans... as we speak.

18:53.620 --> 18:57.688
- That's not... That's impossible.
- When Sean knows we're hiding behind this island.

19:01.762 --> 19:03.928
Why is that impossible, Mr. President?

19:03.930 --> 19:05.597
Great bluff.

19:05.599 --> 19:07.549
<i>That's not what I said.</i>

19:07.551 --> 19:09.184
<i>I think it was.</i>

19:10.554 --> 19:13.104
Why is it impossible?

19:13.106 --> 19:14.939
You think you can manipulate me.

19:14.941 --> 19:17.358
I'm just trying to talk to you, sir.

19:17.360 --> 19:19.778
I'm sure even prisoners on this ship

19:19.780 --> 19:21.980
have a right to their own quarters.

19:21.982 --> 19:24.399
You're not a prisoner.

19:24.401 --> 19:26.451
Well...

19:26.453 --> 19:28.736
Then I can go now?

19:38.321 --> 19:42.138
That sub's got to be wounded from its dive
down into the Canyon during our assault.

19:42.140 --> 19:45.641
That's why Michener said it's
impossible they were on the move.

19:45.643 --> 19:48.227
They must be sitting
off the Coast of Jacksonville

19:48.229 --> 19:49.812
trying to repair it,

19:49.814 --> 19:52.765
which is why they haven't been
chasing us all this time.

19:52.867 --> 19:55.334
So, what do we figure,
from a dive like that?

19:55.336 --> 19:58.904
Could be hull damage,
sound matting, propellers.

19:58.906 --> 20:00.522
Maybe it's beyond repair.

20:00.524 --> 20:01.974
Maybe they'll be parked there for good.

20:01.976 --> 20:03.442
Well, if they can't maneuver...

20:03.444 --> 20:06.311
We don't know that,
and we can't count on it.

20:06.313 --> 20:10.149
We push them, figure out
exactly what their damage is.

20:10.151 --> 20:11.567
They'll be prepared now.

20:11.569 --> 20:14.319
As likely to give me bullshit as the truth.

20:14.321 --> 20:16.822
So we stay here behind the island

20:16.824 --> 20:18.323
or we poke our beaks out?

20:18.325 --> 20:21.627
Bring us out at quiet one...
South-Southeast,

20:21.629 --> 20:24.329
at least 20 miles between us and the coast.

20:25.749 --> 20:26.832
Aye-aye.

20:26.834 --> 20:29.635
Helm, steady course 1-7-0.

20:29.637 --> 20:33.005
All engines, head 2/3 and 12 knots.

20:33.007 --> 20:36.508
I took a cruise by the mess decks.

20:36.510 --> 20:38.343
Pretty hot topic of conversation

20:38.345 --> 20:41.346
why the President
hasn't made an appearance.

20:42.850 --> 20:45.350
I said he was being briefed.

20:46.604 --> 20:48.987
That story won't hold after morning.

20:48.989 --> 20:51.073
Agreed, sir.

20:51.075 --> 20:54.026
I think I blew it.

20:54.028 --> 20:56.161
Trapping him like that.

20:56.163 --> 20:58.413
Got the intel.

20:58.415 --> 21:01.617
Might've lost the man.

21:01.619 --> 21:03.702
The Ramseys offered a narrative

21:03.704 --> 21:06.038
that made his tragedy
something he could live with.

21:06.040 --> 21:09.958
You've got to gain his trust, sir.

21:09.960 --> 21:13.795
Then you'll need a new narrative
that's stronger than theirs.

21:28.646 --> 21:30.562
I wasn't trying to manipulate you,

21:30.564 --> 21:34.233
but I did need to know where that sub was.

21:34.235 --> 21:37.319
Now I know it's damaged
and sitting on the coast.

21:37.321 --> 21:41.406
Which means we have the advantage.

21:41.408 --> 21:43.575
We'll be headed to New Orleans ourselves,

21:43.577 --> 21:46.628
and we're gonna get there
ahead of your friends.

21:46.630 --> 21:49.581
We'll lie in wait for them there,

21:49.583 --> 21:52.134
and we <i> will</i> take them out.

21:56.090 --> 21:59.341
[Inhales deeply]

21:59.343 --> 22:02.094
You should know, sir...

22:03.347 --> 22:06.648
...I've given everything for my country...

22:08.602 --> 22:13.855
...to serve a mission I didn't ask for.

22:15.776 --> 22:19.494
And I'd be sitting safely in a cabin in the
woods in Virginia with my family right now

22:19.496 --> 22:22.748
if I hadn't stayed with this ship.
Instead...

22:24.418 --> 22:27.169
...I lost my wife...

22:28.038 --> 22:30.789
...to the virus.

22:30.791 --> 22:35.344

38:36.885 --> 38:38.585
[Zipper closes]

38:38.587 --> 38:40.837
[Door opens]

38:45.927 --> 38:47.927
[Sighs]

38:47.929 --> 38:49.262
To children.

38:49.264 --> 38:52.231
Mr. President?

38:52.233 --> 38:54.150
I need you to know something.

38:54.152 --> 38:58.571
Everything you and I spoke about
in Dr. Scott's lab...

38:58.573 --> 39:01.608
And I mean <i> everything...</i>

39:01.610 --> 39:03.276
Stays between us.

39:03.278 --> 39:06.829
What matters now is the future

39:06.831 --> 39:09.499
and that you're here with us.

39:09.501 --> 39:12.118
[Inhales deeply]

39:12.120 --> 39:15.371
Let me show you to your new quarters.

39:29.971 --> 39:31.020
Mr. President.

39:31.022 --> 39:32.939
Mr. President.

39:32.941 --> 39:34.273
Mr. President.

39:34.275 --> 39:35.475
As you were.

39:35.477 --> 39:37.644
Interior communications
and closed circuit phone

39:37.646 --> 39:38.978
all set up, sir.

39:38.980 --> 39:40.530
This room is now operationally capable.

39:40.532 --> 39:41.814
Thank you, gentlemen.

39:41.816 --> 39:43.066
Well done.

39:46.154 --> 39:47.403
You can finish that up later.

39:47.405 --> 39:49.155
Yes, sir.

40:07.342 --> 40:10.643
Looks like our toner cartridges
are fading a bit.

40:10.645 --> 40:12.845
But it does the job, I think.

40:12.847 --> 40:14.564
It does.

40:14.566 --> 40:18.768
Brought a few of my shirts
and pants for you.

40:18.770 --> 40:20.103
On the bed there.

40:20.105 --> 40:24.774
Yeah, this one fits pretty well.

40:24.776 --> 40:26.859
And the sleeves are long enough.

40:28.446 --> 40:31.531
We'll have you come out and
officially meet the crew later today.

40:31.533 --> 40:35.702
Just... Shake some hands, say hello.

40:35.704 --> 40:36.586
Of course.

40:36.588 --> 40:39.005
That would, uh...

40:39.007 --> 40:41.090
That would be good.

40:44.129 --> 40:47.346
Anything else we can do for you, sir?

40:50.385 --> 40:53.853
I'm grateful to you, Captain.

40:53.855 --> 40:58.307
I think just about anyone else
would've given up on me.
