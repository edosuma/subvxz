00:02.766 --> 00:06.333
No, this is
my first time online.

00:06.400 --> 00:09.066
Who have you met so far?

00:09.133 --> 00:11.500
No good makin' that up.

00:11.566 --> 00:14.500
Synclaire, if you're gonna
answer those voices in your head

00:14.566 --> 00:16.733
don't do it out loud.

00:16.800 --> 00:19.500
Khadijah, did you know
we could use Flavor's computer

00:19.566 --> 00:22.800
to go online and chat with
people from across the country?

00:22.866 --> 00:25.300
Synclaire, did you know
there's an unemployment line

00:25.366 --> 00:27.633
where you can chat with
out of work people

00:27.700 --> 00:29.433
from across the city?

00:29.500 --> 00:31.966
Now, where's that letter
I asked you to type?

00:32.033 --> 00:33.300
Be right back.

00:35.566 --> 00:41.833
D‐e‐ar, s‐s‐ir.

00:41.900 --> 00:44.933
How is it that you could type
so fast with that computer

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
but you can't do anything
with that?

00:47.066 --> 00:49.700
Baffling, isn't it?

01:34.940 --> 01:37.806
Damn. It's Denise Hatcher.

01:37.873 --> 01:40.140
So who's your friend?

01:40.206 --> 01:43.473
Remember that city all‐star team
I played on in high school.

01:43.540 --> 01:45.273
Denise was on it too.

01:45.340 --> 01:47.240
Must have been
some clerical error.

01:47.306 --> 01:51.873
Hm, it was the 11 best
basketball players in the city.

01:51.940 --> 01:53.540
And Khadijah.

01:53.606 --> 01:57.006
So this is like a reunion.

01:57.073 --> 01:58.640
Why are you here?

01:58.706 --> 02:01.980
Page 48 of your
so called magazine.

02:02.046 --> 02:05.046
"But the nail in the coffin of
Brooklyn Hues Lady BlueKnights

02:05.113 --> 02:07.613
"is their hotheaded coach,
Denise Hatcher

02:07.680 --> 02:11.780
whose leadership will land
the team in last place."

02:11.846 --> 02:15.080
I don't make these predictions,
my sportswriter does.

02:15.146 --> 02:17.213
And she based it
on your team's record.

02:17.279 --> 02:19.146
Nothing personal.

02:19.213 --> 02:21.780
It's always been personal
with you, Khadijah.

02:21.846 --> 02:23.880
Even in high school,
whenever our teams met

02:23.946 --> 02:26.446
you were always trying
to prove you were my equal.

02:26.513 --> 02:28.280
[laughing]

02:28.346 --> 02:32.313
I think I proved that one when
I won the all‐star MVP trophy.

02:32.380 --> 02:34.580
Ooh, good one.

02:38.146 --> 02:41.713
You know, if I were you, I
wouldn't brag about that trophy.

02:41.780 --> 02:43.780
As hard as you cheated
to get it.

02:43.846 --> 02:46.613
Please. You tried to steal
my pass when I was about

02:46.680 --> 02:48.246
to make the game‐winning basket.

02:48.313 --> 02:50.113
Oh, I tried to steal your pass?

02:50.180 --> 02:53.013
Did I stutter?

02:53.080 --> 02:55.346
Look, Denise, you always
been a sore loser

02:55.413 --> 03:00.153
and you'll always be second best
to Khadijah "All‐Chain" James.

03:00.220 --> 03:02.320
Kink‐kink.

03:04.686 --> 03:07.420
Why don't we play a little
one on one to see

03:07.486 --> 03:11.253
if I can handle your game.
Small Chain.

03:11.320 --> 03:16.186
Winner takes home
that MVP trophy...you stole.

03:16.253 --> 03:20.886
Oh, Nise, I don't have time to
entertain ridiculous challenges

03:20.953 --> 03:24.320
from old rivals
who need their ego stroked.

03:24.386 --> 03:27.486
I'm a busy woman.

03:27.553 --> 03:31.486
Yes, yes, I can see you've
been very busy workin' out.

03:38.520 --> 03:40.253
When and where?

03:40.320 --> 03:43.286
I'll reserve the old gym
for Sunday at three.

03:53.053 --> 03:53.986
Bam!

03:59.986 --> 04:01.426
See you, Sunday.

04:01.493 --> 04:03.426

04:06.826 --> 04:07.760

04:13.160 --> 04:17.160
And you can order your airline
tickets...just like that.

04:17.226 --> 04:22.093
Oh, my. Now, Kyle, your online
name is Chocolate Thunder.

04:24.393 --> 04:26.293
Well, Chocolate Lover
and Chocolate Desire

04:26.360 --> 04:28.226
were already taken.

04:28.293 --> 04:30.726
I'm sure Simple Simon was free.

04:32.860 --> 04:37.093
So is Yaking Unemployed Shrew,
care to log on.

04:37.159 --> 04:38.159
Didn't think so.

04:38.226 --> 04:39.793
Anyway, Synclaire

04:39.860 --> 04:42.026
say I want today's
stock market report.

04:42.093 --> 04:44.360
First, I access
prodigious business forum

04:44.426 --> 04:46.193
then I access
the stock market forum

04:46.260 --> 04:50.326
I press this this this
and then....voila.

04:50.393 --> 04:52.660
‐ Today's stock market report.
‐ Yes.

04:52.726 --> 04:56.793
Or you could just turn
to the financial section.

04:58.193 --> 04:59.626
And voila.

05:01.033 --> 05:02.833
Hey, what is wrong
with the phone?

05:02.900 --> 05:04.700
It's hooked up
to the computer there.

05:04.766 --> 05:08.133
Thanks to chocolate blunder.

05:08.200 --> 05:10.966
Kyle, I've been calling here
for the last five minutes.

05:11.033 --> 05:14.033
If I hadn't run into Scooter,
I would've to lug those bags

05:14.100 --> 05:16.200
all the way here
from the corner.

05:16.266 --> 05:18.633
She was hailing a cab
when I saw her.

05:21.966 --> 05:23.033
Whoa! Hey, babe.

05:23.100 --> 05:24.033
Mwah!

05:25.500 --> 05:26.700
Did you find the trophy?

05:26.766 --> 05:28.900
No, it's somewhere
in one of these closets.

05:28.966 --> 05:32.533
I thought you said the trophy
was your treasured keepsake.

05:32.600 --> 05:36.100
That's why I keep it tucked away
and wrapped up in a sock.

05:36.166 --> 05:38.966
Look, the point is, Denise
and I have been playing ball

05:39.033 --> 05:40.900
against each other
since 9th grade.

05:40.966 --> 05:44.500
From the start she thought she
was like God's gift to the game.

05:44.566 --> 05:46.900
Well, I'm here
to tell you she's not.

05:46.966 --> 05:49.400
Calls herself a finesse player.

05:49.466 --> 05:52.300
Big mess player
is what I call her.

05:52.366 --> 05:54.733
So I take it there's
no love lost.

05:54.800 --> 05:57.300
Well, see things got kinda ugly
when Khadijah and Denise

05:57.366 --> 05:59.433
were put on the same
all‐star team together.

05:59.500 --> 06:02.240
Remember, Scooter? Okay, the
team was down by a point, right.

06:02.306 --> 06:05.273
And Denise and Khadijah were
under the basket right near me

06:05.340 --> 06:08.373
in my killer cheerleader outfit
with a midriff sweater.

06:08.440 --> 06:10.573
‐ And the killer skirt with‐‐
‐ Ahem. Ahem.

06:10.640 --> 06:14.140
Okay, anyway, uh, Becky Johnson,
tiny Becky Johnson throws up

06:14.206 --> 06:16.873
an alley‐oop and Khadijah
and Denise both go for it.

06:16.940 --> 06:19.440
Yeah, you're right. That's when
you stepped on her foot.

06:19.506 --> 06:23.006
I did not step on her foot,
she stepped in front of my pass.

06:23.073 --> 06:24.306
Yeah, that‐that's right.
I'm sorry.

06:24.373 --> 06:26.606
I mean she stepped
in front of your pass

06:26.673 --> 06:28.773
and...wedged a foot
underneath yours.

06:30.273 --> 06:32.540
[ball dribbling]

06:32.606 --> 06:34.940
(Denise)
'Yo, Small Chain.'

06:35.006 --> 06:36.273
Is that Denise?

06:36.340 --> 06:39.106
[ball dribbling]

06:39.173 --> 06:42.306
She's outside, dribbling.

06:42.373 --> 06:45.373
(Denise)
'Hope you raise up
to the game, Khadijah.'

06:45.440 --> 06:49.706
'And not just that
stupid look on your face.'

06:49.773 --> 06:52.406
I'm gonna bring this,
so you could look at it

06:52.473 --> 06:55.473
before I put it back
in my display case.

06:55.540 --> 06:57.373
(Denise)
'Incoming.'

07:00.980 --> 07:03.246
"Warning, this is a basketball

07:03.313 --> 07:05.880
"in the wrong hands
it becomes..

07:05.946 --> 07:08.113
...a brick."

07:09.880 --> 07:13.613
All this taunting
and name calling.

07:13.680 --> 07:15.180
Two people and no religion

07:15.246 --> 07:19.013
except for winning,
winning, winning.

07:19.080 --> 07:21.013
God, I miss the courtroom.

07:25.880 --> 07:29.080
Alright, babes, you got it.
Come on. Come on. You got it.

07:29.146 --> 07:30.080
‐ Unh!
‐ Oh!

07:30.146 --> 07:31.680
Yeah!

07:34.480 --> 07:38.746
You blocked three shots
in a row. My girl has game.

07:44.313 --> 07:50.580
[panting]
Well, now that I got you all
warmed up, I can play for real.

07:50.646 --> 07:53.246
Thanks for going
easy on me, Obie.

07:53.313 --> 07:56.113
Oh, I think you left
yo‐your long over there, man.

07:58.046 --> 08:01.120
You know, I've never been more
ready for anything in my life.

08:01.186 --> 08:02.620
I'm gonna win.

08:02.686 --> 08:03.886
Heads up.

08:03.953 --> 08:04.886
[grunts]

08:10.753 --> 08:12.686
[crying]
I'm gonna lose.

08:16.953 --> 08:19.853
I'm telling you man,
it was like the girl had wings.

08:19.920 --> 08:22.453
Denise bounced the ball
off the backboard

08:22.520 --> 08:27.053
got her own rebound, somewhere
like, oh, let's just say here.

08:27.120 --> 08:29.853
Right and..

08:29.920 --> 08:33.086
Of course, a light fixture here
wouldn't really make much sense.

08:33.153 --> 08:35.020
Now will it?

08:35.086 --> 08:36.553
Nice try, Overton,
but I think

08:36.620 --> 08:39.053
Denise jumped
a little higher than that.

08:39.120 --> 08:42.553
It's like she can see
straight through to your soul.

08:42.620 --> 08:46.320
The girl was unbelievable.
Like this..

08:46.386 --> 08:48.720
So I said, "Look how short I'm.

08:48.786 --> 08:52.086
I can't reach
all the way up there."

08:52.153 --> 08:55.120
Alright, I called Overton
just to see how practice went.

08:55.186 --> 08:57.920
And it ain't too late for you
to fake an injury.

08:57.986 --> 09:00.693
Fake an injury? Please.
That's weak.

09:00.760 --> 09:03.226
Khadijah, as soon as
the ball is tossed up

09:03.293 --> 09:07.160
just give that girl
elbow to the jaw.

09:07.226 --> 09:11.693
Oh, Max, please, later
for your pillow talk, huh.

09:11.760 --> 09:13.293
Ack. Ew.

09:13.360 --> 09:16.293
Look, you are all wasting your
breath 'cause I'm not playing.

09:16.360 --> 09:17.860
What?

09:17.926 --> 09:20.826
Khadijah, you're not thinkin'
about quittin'?

09:20.893 --> 09:23.460
I ain't thinkin' about it,
I'm committed to the idea.

09:23.526 --> 09:27.093
Khadijah, that is just
stinkin' thinkin'.

09:27.160 --> 09:30.660
I want you to
lift your chin and win.

09:30.726 --> 09:34.760
Yeah, I gotta agree with
my little Maya Angelou here.

09:34.826 --> 09:38.460
‐ Come on, girl. You can't quit.
‐ Please, can and should.

09:38.526 --> 09:42.060
You need to put this
petty sandbox feud behind.

09:44.026 --> 09:46.760
For my favorite girl,
on and off the court.

09:46.826 --> 09:49.160
‐ Thank you, ba‐‐.
‐ She doesn't deserve these.

09:49.226 --> 09:53.526
‐ She's quittin'.
‐ Give me my flowers.

09:55.626 --> 09:57.560
What's this
about you backin' out?

09:57.626 --> 09:59.860
Well, Scoot, she's afraid
she's gonna get waxed

09:59.926 --> 10:01.333
just 'cause
she's goin' up against

10:01.400 --> 10:04.133
the female Michael Jordan.

10:04.200 --> 10:06.933
And I can't
really argue with that.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.466
Oh, Khadijah, come on,
you're a young black woman

10:09.533 --> 10:11.533
with a college degree,
running your own business.

10:11.600 --> 10:13.766
You dismiss the odds every day.

10:13.833 --> 10:16.733
Now, this game is no different.

10:16.800 --> 10:18.733
You really think I can win?

10:23.366 --> 10:28.033
Well, my granddaddy used to say
there are no longshots.

10:28.100 --> 10:32.466
Odds are always 50‐50,
either you win or you don't.

10:32.533 --> 10:34.833
Wait‐wait. Isn't this
the same granddaddy

10:34.900 --> 10:38.433
who used to always lose his tax
refund plan in numbers.

10:38.500 --> 10:41.400
Not always, Kyle.

10:41.466 --> 10:45.800
Grandpa Wakefield may have been
a dreamer, but he paid off once.

10:45.866 --> 10:47.366
And I'd expect you to remember

10:47.433 --> 10:50.933
since you were the direct
beneficiary of said winnings.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.766
What are you talking
about, Overton?

10:52.833 --> 10:56.033
Well, I'll tell you.

10:56.100 --> 10:58.600
You remember the time
you mama locked her beer room

10:58.666 --> 11:02.506
so you couldn't go to her purse
to steal ice cream money

11:02.573 --> 11:04.940
and I bought you that bon pop.

11:05.006 --> 11:08.806
Well, that 10 cents was
courtesy of Grandpa Wakefield.

11:08.873 --> 11:10.140
The dreamer.

11:16.140 --> 11:18.306
Okay, anyway, Khadijah

11:18.373 --> 11:21.740
if you beat Denise
you can hold it over her head

11:21.806 --> 11:23.606
for the rest of your life.

11:23.673 --> 11:26.540
Much the same way that
I would never let Kyle forget

11:26.606 --> 11:28.940
that he stole money
from his mama's purse.

11:29.006 --> 11:30.573
I was five.

11:30.640 --> 11:33.673
It'd be kinda nice
to shut her up once and for all.

11:33.740 --> 11:37.173
Get her to admit that
I earned that trophy.

11:37.240 --> 11:41.340
To laugh in the face
of that no‐coachin' flagpole.

11:41.406 --> 11:43.806
Alright, Khadijah, first you're
playin' then you're not playin'

11:43.873 --> 11:45.740
I've invited all my
online computer friends.

11:45.806 --> 11:48.673
Is there gonna be
a game or not?

11:48.740 --> 11:50.706
You tell 'em to come
'cause I'm playin'.

11:50.773 --> 11:53.706
Yeah! Alright!
Alright! Yes!

11:53.773 --> 11:56.706

13:31.120 --> 13:34.520
Oh, yeah! Alright, um‐hm.

13:34.586 --> 13:36.920
‐ Big turnout.
‐ Yeah.

13:36.986 --> 13:39.553
Yeah, those are my online
friends I've been chatting with.

13:39.620 --> 13:42.720
Now that we're here, we've got
nothing to say to each other.

13:47.720 --> 13:49.986
‐ Aren't you Branford Marsalis?
‐ Yeah.

13:50.053 --> 13:51.986
‐ I'm with the online group.
‐ Me too.

13:52.053 --> 13:53.886
Really? Well, my handle
is Buckshot LeFonque.

13:53.953 --> 13:55.920
‐ Buckshot LeFonque.
‐ That's it.

13:55.986 --> 13:57.620
My handle is Synclaire James.

13:57.686 --> 14:01.293
‐ Really? What's your real name?
‐ Synclaire James.

14:01.360 --> 14:03.626
Branford Marsalis, Kyle Barker,
fan. Where's Wayne?

14:03.693 --> 14:06.793
He's right behind me in the jazz
section at any record store.

14:09.426 --> 14:12.326
Denise Hatcher.

14:12.393 --> 14:13.993
Do I know you?

14:14.060 --> 14:17.793
Regine, Regine Hunter.
Oh, you remember.

14:17.860 --> 14:21.226
Your boyfriend dumped you so
he could take me to your prom.

14:21.293 --> 14:24.560
But what you probably don't know
is that I stood him up anyway.

14:24.626 --> 14:26.060
Enjoy the game.

14:31.693 --> 14:32.793

14:39.660 --> 14:43.460
Alright, this is 15 minutes
one‐on‐one basketball.

14:43.526 --> 14:45.726
'Winner takes that trophy.
Good luck to you.'

Oh, Khadijah. Oh, Khadijah.

Alright. Get back.
Come on.

[indistinct chatter]

15:12.900 --> 15:15.133
That's alright. That's alright,
baby. That's alright. Come on.

15:15.200 --> 15:18.133
Come on, come on, come on.

15:18.200 --> 15:21.133
[indistinct chatter]

15:32.500 --> 15:35.866
This is it, baby. Wear it out.
Come on. You got it.

15:35.933 --> 15:40.400
Ah, Scooter, you got to
just give it up, give it up.

15:40.466 --> 15:41.400
Time out.

15:48.466 --> 15:53.100
Yes!
Yes. Alright.

15:53.166 --> 15:54.500
Look here, Khadijah.

15:57.133 --> 16:00.273
I can't think of
a single thing to say.

16:00.340 --> 16:02.473
I've been watching,
your girl, Denise

16:02.540 --> 16:04.673
she can't dribble
to her left.

16:04.740 --> 16:08.906
Now, you force her to the left,
game is yours.

16:08.973 --> 16:10.240
Okay. To the left.

16:10.306 --> 16:13.173
Wait a minute, you're gonna need
some more help than that.

16:13.240 --> 16:15.173
Come on y'all,
let's pray.

16:18.040 --> 16:22.773
Lord, please give Khadijah
some skills.

16:24.640 --> 16:27.873
For she humiliate not only
herself but those who love her

16:27.940 --> 16:32.206
and are seen daily
in public with her. Amen.

16:32.273 --> 16:33.606
(all)
Amen.

16:33.673 --> 16:35.840
Hey, remember, she can't
go to her left.

16:35.906 --> 16:37.006
Okay, left.

16:37.073 --> 16:38.040

[audience cheering

Yes!

17:27.713 --> 17:30.480
Look, Khadijah, why don't
we just call it a day?

17:30.546 --> 17:33.746
[panting]
You're...you're
ready to forfeit?

17:33.813 --> 17:37.380
I'm trying to do you a favor,
you can barely stand up.

17:37.446 --> 17:41.846
Look, Denise, I will play you
on one leg if I have to.

17:41.913 --> 17:45.813
See, basketball is your life
and I haven't played in years.

17:45.880 --> 17:50.046
So the way I see it,
if I score one basket.

17:50.113 --> 17:52.413
I'll leave here
with my self‐respect.

17:52.480 --> 17:55.846
Hmm, well, guess I'm gonna have
to take the trophy

17:55.913 --> 17:57.680
and that too.

17:57.746 --> 18:00.353
It's shut out time.

18:01.786 --> 18:04.786
Well, if you think that you
could swing it then bring it.

18:04.853 --> 18:06.386
Huh.

[Kyle barking]

19:07.926 --> 19:09.226
See ya.

19:09.293 --> 19:12.460
You know what, you can block
as many shots as you want

19:12.526 --> 19:15.893
you still don't have any points.

19:15.960 --> 19:19.326
You know, Denise, you shouldn't
dribble it..

19:19.393 --> 19:20.660

19:40.826 --> 19:44.360
I knew you could do it.
I knew you could do it.

19:44.426 --> 19:47.826
‐ I knew you could do it.
‐ You knew I could do what?

19:47.893 --> 19:52.260
Lose technically,
but win spiritually.

19:52.326 --> 19:55.393
So, uh, Kadijah.

19:55.460 --> 19:59.160
Hand it over, come.

19:59.226 --> 20:03.933
Go ahead, take it.
But it still has my name on it.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.466
Hmm. Not anymore.

20:06.533 --> 20:07.466
Bam!

20:13.133 --> 20:15.200
But you know what,
Khadijah.

20:15.266 --> 20:17.633
You showed a lot of heart
out there.

20:17.700 --> 20:19.066
You get much respect.

20:19.133 --> 20:21.466
Alright, so admit it.

20:21.533 --> 20:24.333
I earned that trophy
in high school.

20:24.400 --> 20:26.633
To be honest,
I wedged my foot under yours

20:26.700 --> 20:28.466
and you still made the shot.

20:28.533 --> 20:32.166
And you deserve to be the MVP.

20:32.233 --> 20:35.633
Hear that?
No need to dwell in the past.

20:35.700 --> 20:38.433
I'll just write about it
in my next issue of Flavor.

20:38.500 --> 20:40.433
[scoffs]
Well, if you do

20:40.500 --> 20:44.166
uh, make sure you print
a picture of me holding this.

20:46.566 --> 20:48.833
I'll get my cartoonist
on it right away.

20:52.233 --> 20:53.500
Come on, y'all.
Let's celebrate.

20:53.566 --> 20:55.500
Yeah!
