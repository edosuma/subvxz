You gotta let it go.

00:12.579 --> 00:14.345
Rolanda was sad.

Sounds like a kind
of synchronicity.

Two unrelated memories
have somehow become

04:41.649 --> 04:43.982
Intertwined or connected in
this dream you're having.

04:44.117 --> 04:45.784
I-I thought all
this would stop

04:45.853 --> 04:46.985
Once I got out
of the hospital

have to testify.

I don't see how
it's relevant.

Mel:
<i> Sometimes trauma can</i>
<i> bond with trauma.</i>

Maybe if we unpack the
trip we can find the,

05:08.675 --> 05:11.209

But there's
nothing to tell.

05:17.084 --> 05:18.283
<i> I already told you,</i>

05:18.285 --> 05:21.353
It was one of the
happiest times of my life.

05:24.758 --> 05:27.024
Colleen:
<i> I got a call from the</i>
<i> minister's office.</i>

05:27.061 --> 05:28.026
And?

05:28.161 --> 05:30.228
Told them how beneficial
your talents would be

05:30.297 --> 05:31.496
To the court of appeal

05:31.498 --> 05:34.566
And how fortunate
they'd be to have you.

05:34.701 --> 05:35.767
I owe you.

05:35.902 --> 05:36.768
Oh, are you kidding me?

05:36.903 --> 05:38.436
I'm so grateful to
you for helping me

05:38.505 --> 05:40.572
Make sense of all of
this judge business.

Never.

I've got three kids.

05:52.753 --> 05:54.252
I've had two
miscarriages.

05:54.388 --> 05:56.588
Getting pregnant was
never a problem.

<i> So much trouble.</i>

06:02.663 --> 06:03.995
<i> I went to see a specialist</i>

06:04.064 --> 06:05.863
<i> And the first thing</i>
<i> that dr. Casey asked</i>

06:05.899 --> 06:08.066
After examining
me was,

06:08.135 --> 06:10.669
"when did I have
my tubes tied?"

06:10.671 --> 06:12.504
[larissa scoffs]

06:12.639 --> 06:13.871
I think I laughed

06:15.876 --> 06:17.075
Just 'cause,
I don't know,

06:17.077 --> 06:19.611
The idea seemed
so foolish to me.

06:19.746 --> 06:21.479
I'm an only child.

06:22.516 --> 06:24.415
I always wanted
lots of kids.

06:24.417 --> 06:26.084
Did you and reece,
your fiancÃ©,

06:26.086 --> 06:27.852
End up conceiving
children together?

06:29.156 --> 06:30.755
No.

06:30.758 --> 06:31.756
Dr. Casey said

06:31.792 --> 06:34.092
With how the tubal
ligation was done

06:34.227 --> 06:36.595
And the amount of
time that had passed,

06:36.597 --> 06:39.564
The chances of a reversal
surgery being successful were...

06:41.368 --> 06:42.700
[larissa sighs]

06:43.637 --> 06:44.902
It wasn't good.

06:44.938 --> 06:46.103
Doug:
<i> Were you able to determine</i>

06:46.140 --> 06:47.872
Who performed the
tubal ligation?

06:48.742 --> 06:51.108
Dr. Lawson,
right there.

06:52.579 --> 06:54.579
Doug:
<i> And how did you come</i>
<i> to this conclusion?</i>

06:54.581 --> 06:56.782
Dr. Lawson delivered
my last child.

06:56.917 --> 06:58.517
<i> During our initial</i>
<i> conversation,</i>

06:58.519 --> 07:00.718
He asked if I
was certain

07:00.754 --> 07:02.320
I wanted to bring
another child

07:02.356 --> 07:03.822
Into my situation.

07:03.957 --> 07:05.290
"your situation"?

07:05.425 --> 07:06.724
Larissa:
<i> A single mother on</i>
<i> welfare with two kids</i>

07:06.760 --> 07:08.693
Living in social housing.

07:08.762 --> 07:10.862
He told me it wasn't too
late to have an abortion.

07:10.931 --> 07:13.498
I told him I
wanted my child.

07:13.567 --> 07:15.900
Did he ever raise the topic
of abortion with you again?

07:16.737 --> 07:18.136
No.

07:18.138 --> 07:19.070
But he said

07:19.139 --> 07:20.138
Because he was
doing a c-section,

07:20.140 --> 07:21.940
He could tie my
tubes if I wanted.

07:21.942 --> 07:25.776
Doug:
<i>Larissa, did you want dr. Lawson</i>
<i> to perform a tubal ligation?</i>

07:25.813 --> 07:27.712
No, I didn't.

07:27.748 --> 07:29.547
No further questions.

07:32.586 --> 07:34.019
Sigmond:
<i> Okay.</i>

07:34.154 --> 07:35.820
And you weren't in
the best shape mentally

07:35.823 --> 07:38.155
When you first met
dr. Lawson, correct?

07:38.192 --> 07:39.757
<i> Your blood pressure</i>
<i> was sky high</i>

07:39.793 --> 07:40.692
And you were suffering
from depression,

07:40.827 --> 07:41.726
Isn't that right?

07:41.795 --> 07:43.228
Yes.

07:43.297 --> 07:44.362
Sigmond:
<i> And isn't it true</i>
<i> that you're the one</i>

07:44.398 --> 07:46.631
That initiated the
conversation with dr. Lawson

07:46.633 --> 07:48.866
With the possibility of
terminating the pregnancy?

07:48.868 --> 07:49.835
No!

07:49.970 --> 07:51.168
Sigmond:
<i> You didn't break</i>
<i> down in tears</i>

07:51.205 --> 07:53.371

and I quote,

07:54.274 --> 07:55.507
"gotten my tubes tied

08:17.664 --> 08:18.930
I'm just not up to it.

08:19.633 --> 08:20.932
I get it.

08:21.835 --> 08:23.535
You sure?

08:23.670 --> 08:25.804
Or do you always pack
with this much intensity?

08:25.806 --> 08:26.771
Marcie, I just really wish

08:26.807 --> 08:28.606
You would've told
me this sooner.

08:28.642 --> 08:29.607
The whole reason
I set this up

08:29.676 --> 08:31.276
Was for you and my
folks to meet properly.

08:31.278 --> 08:32.744
I know, I just...

08:37.217 --> 08:38.616

been dead for three months.

08:49.095 --> 08:50.428
You don't have to worry
about seeing him in court.

08:50.564 --> 08:51.963
He's not gonna hurt you.

08:54.501 --> 08:55.800
I know, I just...

08:58.005 --> 09:01.639
I just wanna curl up in a
ball and go in my closet.

09:06.280 --> 09:07.779
Okay, look, I'm-I'm
not gonna go.

09:07.848 --> 09:08.847
What?

09:08.849 --> 09:09.781
No, I won't, I won't go.
-No, no, no.

09:09.850 --> 09:10.916
No, no, no, no, no, no.
-No, it's okay.

09:11.051 --> 09:12.717
You need to go,
you've been...

09:13.920 --> 09:18.456
You've been so amazing
but I need a break.

09:19.526 --> 09:21.059
<i> I'm sure you could</i>
<i> use a break too.</i>

09:21.061 --> 09:23.294
<i> I mean, go have fun</i>
<i> with your folks.</i>

09:23.330 --> 09:28.666
Go have fun and-and-and
I will try to shower

09:28.702 --> 09:31.302
<i> At least once</i>
<i> before you get back.</i>

09:32.906 --> 09:34.672
Oh, well,

09:39.746 --> 09:41.179
You smell like heaven.

09:42.115 --> 09:43.681
Nice try.

09:43.717 --> 09:45.717
[gentle music]

09:45.852 --> 09:47.251
I'll see you in
a couple days.

09:51.758 --> 09:52.824
I love you.

09:52.959 --> 09:59.898
[gentle music continues]

10:00.033 --> 10:06.737
â™ª

10:08.008 --> 10:10.975
Dewey's husband is the chair
of the advisory committee.

10:10.978 --> 10:12.977
Dewey is chief justice.

10:12.980 --> 10:14.979
She can recommend which
trial division judge

10:14.982 --> 10:16.715
Gets to be a part
of that committee.

10:16.850 --> 10:19.050
<i> You know how long it's been</i>
<i> since an openly queer judge</i>

10:19.185 --> 10:21.619
Has been on that
advisory committee?

10:21.622 --> 10:23.221
Not since she's
been chief justice.

10:23.223 --> 10:24.622
Hubert banks:
<i> That's four years.</i>

10:24.658 --> 10:27.358
We need representation
on that committee.

10:27.394 --> 10:28.926
What do you want me to do?

10:28.996 --> 10:30.929
Reach out to the
chief justice of the province.

10:31.064 --> 10:32.797
She's out, isn't she?

10:32.833 --> 10:33.998
Darcy's a political animal.

10:34.001 --> 10:35.333
She's just gonna say

10:35.335 --> 10:38.203
Wait until dewey's husband
is no longer the chair.

10:38.205 --> 10:40.739
Besides, everyone knows
you're dewey's pet.

10:41.842 --> 10:42.941
What did you say?

10:43.076 --> 10:44.008
I'm sorry.

10:44.044 --> 10:46.745
I meant to say
she's fond of you.

10:46.880 --> 10:49.781
Look, all we're asking is for
you to make the suggestion.

10:53.220 --> 10:54.819
Yeah.

10:55.822 --> 10:57.621
[grand music]

10:57.658 --> 10:59.623
Vivian:
<i> Hey, heard you got</i>
<i> spanked in court today.</i>

11:00.427 --> 11:01.893
Wasn't my best day.

11:03.997 --> 11:04.896
None for me.

11:05.031 --> 11:06.831
Oh.

11:06.833 --> 11:09.367
I'm gonna need you to pull
back on this larissa stuff.

11:09.502 --> 11:10.902
Ah, just in case.

11:13.506 --> 11:14.906
Is this about reggie?

11:14.908 --> 11:17.642
I don't mind you colouring
outside the lines a little,

11:17.644 --> 11:20.611
But this thing with the doctor
and fighting with reggie.

11:21.848 --> 11:22.847
It's gotta stop.

11:22.849 --> 11:23.748
You're right.

11:23.883 --> 11:25.917
I was completely
out of line.

11:26.052 --> 11:28.052
I just had my
assistant send over

11:28.121 --> 11:30.654
A case of that
"quebec beer" he likes.

11:33.927 --> 11:35.593
This jay redbird
is stunning.

11:35.729 --> 11:36.995
<i> Michelle set me</i>
<i> up with that.</i>

11:37.130 --> 11:39.898
Your girl's got
a killer eye.

11:39.900 --> 11:41.666
She's so excited
for your wedding.

11:41.735 --> 11:44.068
She's my one bright
spot at the moment.

11:44.104 --> 11:45.236
<i> You know what?</i>

11:45.238 --> 11:47.638
I think I have something
that may change your mood.

11:57.217 --> 12:01.085
[gentle music]

12:01.088 --> 12:03.053
Doug:
<i> Is this what I think it is?</i>

12:03.090 --> 12:05.356
<i> The eskasoni office of</i>
<i> marcie diggs & associates.</i>

12:06.926 --> 12:07.959
We're getting it done.

12:08.094 --> 12:09.026
Vivian:
<i> Privately run,</i>

12:09.062 --> 12:11.296
Fully-funded legal services

12:11.298 --> 12:12.764
For your community.

12:13.900 --> 12:16.100
Happy, friend?

12:16.103 --> 12:18.435
[both chuckle]

12:20.474 --> 12:23.040
Doug:
<i> Your honour, these consent</i>
<i>forms simply cannot be relied on</i>

12:23.110 --> 12:25.977
<i> As a basis to dismiss</i>
<i> my clients claims.</i>

12:26.112 --> 12:27.444
<i> My clients consented</i>
<i> to giving birth,</i>

12:27.581 --> 12:29.847
Not having their reproductive
futures taken from them-

12:29.916 --> 12:31.983
Your honour, doctors
have to be in a position

12:32.118 --> 12:33.751
To make split
second decisions.

12:33.754 --> 12:35.320
Allowing this
lawsuit to proceed

12:35.322 --> 12:37.055
Undermines that
entire system.

12:37.190 --> 12:39.123
Informed consent does
not begin and end

12:39.258 --> 12:40.992
With a signature at the
bottom of a printed form-

12:40.994 --> 12:42.893
That's not for you to decide,
with respect.

12:44.164 --> 12:45.063
Your honour,

12:45.198 --> 12:46.330
<i> We deserve the opportunity</i>

12:46.366 --> 12:48.233
<i> To properly put forward</i>
<i> our claims of duress,</i>

12:48.368 --> 12:50.501
Incapacitation and,
in some cases, fraud,

12:50.537 --> 12:51.836
<i> With respect to</i>
<i> these consent-</i>

12:51.972 --> 12:53.104
Your honour, this constant
slander of my client-

12:53.173 --> 12:55.073
Tread lightly, mr. Paul.

12:55.208 --> 12:57.008
<i> Having heard the</i>
<i> arguments of counsel,</i>

12:57.077 --> 12:59.076
I've decided to give
mr. Paul a chance

12:59.146 --> 13:00.278
To present his evidence

13:00.280 --> 13:02.013
Supporting his
argument of duress

13:02.148 --> 13:03.881
Regarding the signed
consent forms.

13:04.017 --> 13:05.383
Sigmond:
<i> In that case, we'd</i>
<i> ask that the evidence</i>

13:05.518 --> 13:07.285
To support their
duress argument

13:07.287 --> 13:08.686
Be limited to
the time period

13:08.755 --> 13:10.855
Directly before the
signing of the consent

13:10.990 --> 13:14.091
And not include the
consultations months earlier.

13:14.161 --> 13:15.292
Ellery:
<i> Objection, your honour.</i>

13:15.328 --> 13:17.262
Counsel's request narrows
the scope of our argument.

13:17.397 --> 13:18.896
Yes, it does.

13:20.167 --> 13:22.099
The defendant's
request is granted.

13:22.135 --> 13:24.101
<i> Complainant's duress</i>
<i> argument can only relate</i>

13:24.171 --> 13:26.437
To discussions that
occurred within 24 hours

13:26.573 --> 13:29.940
Of dr. Lawson's patients
signing the consent form.

13:29.976 --> 13:31.442
<i> We're adjourned.</i>

13:31.578 --> 13:37.114
[tense music]

13:37.150 --> 13:38.549
Cancel whatever
plans you have.

13:38.552 --> 13:40.251
If we don't thread
this needle,

13:40.386 --> 13:41.986
We're done.

13:42.022 --> 13:51.929
[tense music swells]

13:52.065 --> 13:53.497
Iris:
<i> What about this one?</i>

13:54.167 --> 13:55.867
Hmm, um...

13:56.603 --> 13:57.902
Fails on time period.

13:58.037 --> 13:58.936
This one could be good.

13:58.972 --> 14:00.471
Single mother, four kids,

14:00.540 --> 14:02.506
Works as an ea at the
department of finance.

14:03.543 --> 14:05.143
Oh, I remember this one.

14:05.145 --> 14:06.811
She said he performed
her tubal ligation

14:06.813 --> 14:09.113
After she gave birth
and she consented,

14:09.248 --> 14:10.814
But her psychiatrist
told dr. Lawson

14:10.851 --> 14:13.550
That she was suffering
from postpartum depression.

14:13.587 --> 14:15.586
She recommended
against the procedure.

14:15.589 --> 14:17.021
Why isn't she on
our witness list?

14:17.023 --> 14:18.189
Reggie:
<i> You know why.</i>

14:18.258 --> 14:20.357
Ms. Jefferson's strategy
of "black women only".

14:20.393 --> 14:22.159
Do we have a retainer
agreement with her?

14:22.195 --> 14:24.495
She was poached by
another law firm.

14:24.631 --> 14:26.163
We found one,
we'll find another.

14:26.233 --> 14:27.798
I think I found something.

14:27.868 --> 14:29.166
Morgan quinn.

14:29.236 --> 14:30.101
That doesn't ring a bell.

14:30.236 --> 14:31.402
Iris:
<i> Morgan elizabeth quinn.</i>

14:31.404 --> 14:33.170
<i> She was in a serious</i>
<i> car accident</i>

14:33.240 --> 14:35.039
When she was
eight months pregnant.

14:35.041 --> 14:36.173
Unconscious.
No consent form.

14:36.209 --> 14:37.508
Jackpot.

14:37.510 --> 14:38.342
Iris:
<i> She gave birth to</i>
<i> a healthy baby</i>

14:38.411 --> 14:39.410
And two years later,

14:39.412 --> 14:41.045
She found out
that dr. Lawson

14:41.047 --> 14:43.847
Performed a tubal ligation
without her consent.

14:43.884 --> 14:45.183
That means even if
we lose the motion

14:45.318 --> 14:46.651
We're still in the game.

14:46.653 --> 14:48.586
Ellery:
<i> Oh, iris, you got</i>
<i> his pronouns wrong.</i>

14:48.655 --> 14:50.154
<i> Morgan's a "he".</i>
<i> He's a trans man.</i>

14:50.290 --> 14:51.656
We need to track
down morgan.

14:51.658 --> 14:54.391
Nope, he revoked his retainer
agreement three weeks ago.

14:54.427 --> 14:56.127
Doug:
<i> I thought you were staying</i>
<i> on top of our complainants,</i>

14:56.262 --> 14:57.962
Keeping 'em on side.

14:58.098 --> 15:00.164
Ellery:
<i> Our "named" complainants at</i>
<i> the forefront of the case.</i>

15:00.233 --> 15:02.967
Find morgan quinn,
convince him to testify.

15:05.605 --> 15:06.804
Judge vo:
<i> For count one,</i>

15:06.840 --> 15:10.541
<i> A sentence of</i>
<i> six months in jail.</i>

15:10.610 --> 15:11.676
[knock on door]
<i> for count two,</i>

15:11.678 --> 15:13.544
<i> The sentence of-</i>

15:13.613 --> 15:14.879
I still can't get over it.

15:14.881 --> 15:17.548
Live feed access into
everyone's courtroom.

15:17.684 --> 15:19.216
Provides a different
perspective, doesn't it?

15:19.252 --> 15:20.851
Fascinating.

15:21.721 --> 15:22.887
Um, I was gonna
come see you-

15:23.022 --> 15:25.623
Actually, my husband is
chairing the advisory committee

15:25.758 --> 15:27.291
For the next
round of hiring

15:27.294 --> 15:29.593
For nova scotia trial
division judges.

15:29.663 --> 15:33.364
We want the committee
to be more inclusive.

15:33.499 --> 15:35.800
Colleen:
<i> That's exactly what I wanted</i>
<i> to speak to you about.</i>

15:35.935 --> 15:39.236
I mean, we could really use
more lgbtq+ representation

15:39.272 --> 15:40.237
On that committee.

15:40.273 --> 15:42.206
So we're agreed [laughs].

15:42.342 --> 15:43.374
<i> That was easy.</i>

15:43.509 --> 15:45.242
No. Oh, sorry.

15:45.278 --> 15:47.411
<i> No, I mean, thank you</i>
<i> for thinking of me.</i>

15:47.480 --> 15:52.049
Ah, I was thinking judge pinch
would be perfect for that job.

15:52.085 --> 15:53.217
She's a progressive thinker-

15:53.286 --> 15:55.453
Judge dewey:
<i> Brittney pinch is fine,</i>

15:55.455 --> 15:59.056
But your experience as a
manager of halifax legal aid

15:59.092 --> 16:01.592
And the fact that you ran
your own firm in toronto.

16:01.661 --> 16:04.195
You have the practical
recruitment experience

16:04.264 --> 16:06.197
<i> A lot of your</i>
<i> colleagues lack.</i>

16:06.266 --> 16:09.033
<i> And, the fact</i>
<i> that you are also</i>

16:09.102 --> 16:13.037
A member of the lgbt+
community is a real plus.

16:15.141 --> 16:16.607
I'll definitely
think about it.

16:21.414 --> 16:22.814
Are they green?

16:22.949 --> 16:25.349
There you go, yeah.

16:25.352 --> 16:27.317
[child vocalizes]

16:27.354 --> 16:28.886
Morgan:
<i> Oh, you want this guy?</i>

16:31.191 --> 16:32.256
I can't talk to you.

16:32.392 --> 16:33.924
Morgan, we're really
sorry about how we-

16:33.994 --> 16:35.893
<i> No, I really can't</i>
<i> talk to you.</i>

16:37.163 --> 16:40.697
You settled with dr. Lawson,
didn't you?

16:40.734 --> 16:45.369
[emotional music]

16:45.372 --> 16:48.338
I haven't heard from anyone
at your firm in over a month.

16:48.375 --> 16:51.442
<i> It was obvious that nobody</i>
<i> cared about me or my story.</i>

16:53.279 --> 16:56.246
So yeah, I took the money.

16:58.518 --> 17:00.251
I'm sorry,
he's not a good guy,

17:02.388 --> 17:04.522
But I needed to take
care of my family.

17:04.524 --> 17:09.493
[emotional music continues]

17:10.363 --> 17:11.462
Doug, I can't do this.

17:11.531 --> 17:13.064
<i> Larissa, we need you.</i>
<i> See, right now-</i>

17:13.199 --> 17:15.066
I'll sit in the gallery.

17:15.201 --> 17:16.968
I'll support the other
women on the case,

17:16.970 --> 17:19.804
But I just can't.

17:19.806 --> 17:21.539
I can't be out there
like you and vivian want.

17:21.541 --> 17:22.673
Larissa, please.

17:22.808 --> 17:24.275
That's enough, doug.

17:24.410 --> 17:25.476
She says she's out.

17:39.025 --> 17:40.958
"start" being the
operative word.

17:41.094 --> 17:42.559
Dad's busy?

17:42.595 --> 17:44.361
Savanna:
<i> Well, for a man who's</i>
<i> supposed to be retired,</i>

17:44.431 --> 17:46.764
He doesn't know how
to say no [chuckles].

Well, dad loves taking
care of people.

17:58.244 --> 17:59.276
Anyways.

17:59.345 --> 18:01.312
How you doing?

18:01.381 --> 18:02.312
How's marcie?

18:02.348 --> 18:05.049
She's not here
with you so

18:05.051 --> 18:06.784
I'm guessing it's
still a struggle.

18:06.853 --> 18:08.585
Yeah, one day at a time.

18:09.722 --> 18:15.126
You, for better or worse
are so much more like me.

18:15.261 --> 18:18.329
Be patient with her, okay?

18:18.464 --> 18:20.531
Just it's hard sometimes, mom.

18:23.236 --> 18:24.401
Come inside.

18:24.437 --> 18:28.239
I got a pan of
lasagna [chuckles].

18:28.374 --> 18:31.208
And I know that'll cure
what ails you [laughs].

18:34.080 --> 18:36.213
Colleen, I'm not trying to
diminish your capabilities

18:36.282 --> 18:37.748
But this is about you
"straight passing".

18:37.817 --> 18:39.483
I'm not "straight passing".

18:39.486 --> 18:41.485
Right, but I have heard
people describe you

18:41.521 --> 18:43.086
As someone who
happens to be gay.

18:43.123 --> 18:45.422
Well, don't put their
assumptions on me.

18:45.458 --> 18:46.557
You know, you're right.

18:46.692 --> 18:47.758
You're right.

18:47.894 --> 18:48.826
Loretta likes you.

18:48.961 --> 18:50.627
And, even though I
know you're private

18:50.663 --> 18:53.431
And don't like to lead
with your sexual identity,

18:53.433 --> 18:56.767
You being in the room means
that we're in the room with you.

18:56.803 --> 18:58.302
You'll fight for us.

19:03.243 --> 19:05.042
Doug:
<i> I don't even know if</i>
<i> we have a case anymore.</i>

19:05.044 --> 19:06.377
I'll speak to larissa.

19:06.512 --> 19:07.444
Reggie:
<i> You.</i>

19:07.480 --> 19:08.813
You're the problem.

19:08.815 --> 19:11.182
This happened because
morgan doesn't fit the story

19:11.251 --> 19:12.683
That you want to tell.

19:12.818 --> 19:14.718
Why don't you just leave,
if you're not gonna be helpful?

19:14.720 --> 19:16.587
Viv, that's enough.
-<i> Helpful? Like you?</i>

19:16.722 --> 19:18.189
You made these
women believe in us

19:18.324 --> 19:19.657
And then you,
you screwed them.

19:19.659 --> 19:21.492
<i> Not doug, not us, you.</i>

19:21.494 --> 19:23.995
Man, you need to
get off my ass.

19:24.130 --> 19:25.529
Remember who pays
the bills here.

19:25.532 --> 19:27.064
Iris:
<i> Can you stop?</i>

19:27.567 --> 19:28.399
<i> Just stop.</i>

19:28.534 --> 19:30.001
You have no right, vivian.

19:30.136 --> 19:31.635
Not after what happened.

19:32.538 --> 19:33.671
<i> The shooting.</i>

19:33.673 --> 19:39.677
[tense music]

19:39.679 --> 19:45.249
â™ª

19:45.384 --> 19:46.617
Doug:
<i> Reg.</i>

19:49.622 --> 19:50.487
<i> She was out of line.</i>

19:50.623 --> 19:51.521
<i> That shouldn't</i>
<i> have happened.</i>

19:51.558 --> 19:53.123
Reggie:
<i> But it did.</i>

19:53.159 --> 19:54.658
She has no right to
treat me like that.

19:54.727 --> 19:58.095
[stammers] she's acting
like I'm the enemy.

19:58.164 --> 19:59.363
Doug:
<i> I'll talk to her.</i>

19:59.365 --> 20:00.497
Talk, huh.

20:00.533 --> 20:01.498
No, this was inevitable.

20:01.534 --> 20:04.167
With marcie gone,
I mean, it's not you.

20:04.204 --> 20:06.170
She doesn't respect the
rules that we live by.

20:06.172 --> 20:07.571
She just does
what she wants.

20:07.574 --> 20:10.307
And I'm telling you my friend,
I am too old for this shit.

20:13.413 --> 20:15.646
Marcie:
<i> It's a lot of food</i>
<i> for one person.</i>

20:15.648 --> 20:17.448
Your dad's coming by tonight,
isn't he?

20:18.651 --> 20:20.517
I'm sure he needs a
home-cooked meal.

20:20.587 --> 20:22.987
So what's going on
with you two anyway?

20:23.056 --> 20:24.588
Nothing.

20:24.624 --> 20:26.791
He's enjoying his freedom,
I'm enjoying mine.

20:26.793 --> 20:27.725
Mhm.

20:27.794 --> 20:30.193
Velma:
<i> Your mom's a hot property.</i>

20:30.230 --> 20:32.330
Men have been after me
like flies at a picnic.

20:33.466 --> 20:34.999
Little old to be starting
your "ho phase",

20:35.134 --> 20:36.633
Don't you think?

20:36.669 --> 20:39.369
And you're not too old for
me to slap across the mouth.

20:40.539 --> 20:43.541
I'm not sure I even want
another man in my life.

20:43.676 --> 20:46.744
It's kind of nice being able
to spread out on the bed,

20:46.813 --> 20:49.847
Not fighting about
whose side is whose,

20:49.849 --> 20:51.649
<i> Not having your</i>
<i> father's cold feet</i>

20:51.784 --> 20:54.618
Wake me up in the
middle of the night.

20:54.621 --> 20:57.421
[laughs] god, it's
like his feet die

20:57.457 --> 20:59.222
And are revived
in the morning.

21:01.427 --> 21:03.761
Maybe we could go
on a double date.

21:03.830 --> 21:06.029
[knocking on door]

21:06.065 --> 21:07.765
That's not gonna happen, mom.

21:13.640 --> 21:15.205
Can we talk?

21:16.276 --> 21:18.342
It's really ugly, marcie.

21:18.477 --> 21:20.745
<i> Doug is now realizing that</i>
<i> if you give viv an inch,</i>

21:20.880 --> 21:22.379
She's gonna take a mile.

21:23.716 --> 21:26.383
<i> If you don't come back I'm</i>
<i> certain reggie's gonna quit.</i>

21:30.123 --> 21:31.621
I'm not ready.

21:33.059 --> 21:34.658
Then get ready, marcie.

21:34.661 --> 21:35.860
Marcie:
<i> You hear that, mom?</i>

21:35.862 --> 21:37.594
<i> She says, "get ready."</i>

21:37.664 --> 21:39.530
How many times
have I heard that?

21:39.532 --> 21:40.864
Every day.

21:41.968 --> 21:43.601
Marcie:
<i> Look, I spoke to</i>
<i> doug last week.</i>

21:43.736 --> 21:45.569
He said everything
was fine.

21:45.705 --> 21:47.437
Vivian moved into
your office.

21:48.675 --> 21:51.342
<i> Trust me,</i>
<i> everything is not fine.</i>

21:51.477 --> 22:06.657
[tense music]

22:06.792 --> 22:07.691
Charlie:
<i> Look at ya.</i>

22:07.760 --> 22:09.493
<i> Doing dishes [laughs].</i>

22:10.797 --> 22:12.496
Good to see you, son.
-<i> Hey, dad.</i>

22:13.299 --> 22:14.698
I'm glad I didn't miss ya.

22:15.434 --> 22:16.700
Mom says you got tied up.

22:16.703 --> 22:20.838
Yeah, yeah, whole system been
on life support pre-covid.

22:20.973 --> 22:23.774
Now, something's gotta change.

22:23.776 --> 22:24.642
Where's marcie?

22:24.777 --> 22:26.310
Ah, she couldn't come.

22:26.979 --> 22:27.878
How's she feeling?

22:27.947 --> 22:29.913
Did she finish her
outpatient therapy?

22:29.982 --> 22:30.981
Yeah, I mean, she's-she's
coming around.

22:30.983 --> 22:31.982
Yeah.

22:31.984 --> 22:33.517
Physically, anyway.

22:33.652 --> 22:34.985
It's just psychological stuff.

22:34.987 --> 22:36.187
Yeah, yeah.

22:36.189 --> 22:39.156
It's unpredictable
for sure.

22:39.192 --> 22:40.091
Hmm.

22:40.226 --> 22:42.159
Well, I need to take a shower.

22:42.195 --> 22:44.128
We'll catch up in a few.
-Okay. Yeah.

22:44.197 --> 22:47.264
Hey, vangie, did you
give avery that letter

22:47.266 --> 22:48.766
<i> That came from</i>
<i> the government?</i>

22:48.768 --> 22:50.667
Is it going somewhere?

22:50.737 --> 22:51.869
Well, I don't know,
dear, is it?

22:51.938 --> 22:53.737
Come on, come on.

22:53.773 --> 22:55.139
[both laugh]

22:55.208 --> 22:56.540
All right.

22:58.945 --> 23:00.711
Letter?

23:00.780 --> 23:02.079
What letter, mom?

23:02.214 --> 23:04.548
Savanna:
<i> Government's opening</i>
<i> up the books finally.</i>

23:06.018 --> 23:07.951
Kids who were adopted

23:07.987 --> 23:10.421
Can get their birth
parents information

23:10.423 --> 23:12.356
<i> Unless the birth</i>
<i> parents file a,</i>

23:12.425 --> 23:13.791
<i> A veto asking,</i>

23:13.793 --> 23:15.759
Asking not to
be contacted.

23:17.797 --> 23:20.764
<i> If you're curious,</i>
<i> you know, now's,</i>

23:20.800 --> 23:22.366
Now's your chance.

23:31.844 --> 23:34.611
Doug tells me you wanna
take your name off the case.

23:35.481 --> 23:37.214
It's too much.

23:37.250 --> 23:38.783
You made me believe
that the courts cared

23:38.918 --> 23:41.651
About black women who were
butchered by that doctor.

23:44.690 --> 23:46.323
You remember my grandma,

23:46.325 --> 23:50.594
<i> She had that unit just across</i>
<i> from your mom's in jellybean?</i>

23:50.663 --> 23:53.197
She revered her doctor.

23:53.199 --> 23:54.598
He was like god.

23:55.435 --> 23:58.435
Then, she had a stroke,

23:59.439 --> 24:01.205
Couldn't swallow.

24:01.207 --> 24:03.340
Perfectly healthy,
just couldn't swallow.

24:04.877 --> 24:08.479
Doctor wanted to put a
feeding tube down her throat

24:08.481 --> 24:10.147
And be done with her.

24:10.282 --> 24:11.815
To hell with that, I said.

24:12.885 --> 24:15.218
But grandma thought
her doctor was god.

24:18.891 --> 24:21.658
She died with that
feeding tube in her belly.

24:23.295 --> 24:25.629
<i> Look, I wasn't being</i>
<i> naive about this.</i>

24:25.764 --> 24:29.032
Even if we lose, we win.

24:29.068 --> 24:32.903
Dr. Lawson will think twice
about pulling that shit

24:32.905 --> 24:34.304
On another one of us.

24:38.878 --> 24:40.043
[vivian sighs]

24:40.079 --> 24:42.646
If we don't have a client,
we don't have a case.

24:44.784 --> 24:50.854
[gentle music]

24:50.890 --> 25:00.631
â™ª

25:00.700 --> 25:05.569
â™ª

25:07.874 --> 25:11.075
Marcie, you're back.

25:11.077 --> 25:12.610
Vivian.

25:17.950 --> 25:19.316
That's subtle.

25:19.451 --> 25:20.951
Marcie:
<i> You and I both know</i>
<i> setting up shop here</i>

25:20.953 --> 25:22.052
Was a breach of
our agreement.

25:22.121 --> 25:23.220
Just trying to be of help.

25:23.355 --> 25:25.322
And I appreciate that,
I do.

25:25.324 --> 25:28.091
But I'm back now.

25:29.128 --> 25:30.694
You don't gotta
tell me twice.

25:30.829 --> 25:32.095
Your things?

25:32.131 --> 25:33.530
Trash it.

25:33.566 --> 25:35.365
I'll be seeing ya, partner.

25:38.437 --> 25:39.870
Louise:
<i> You're really doing this?</i>

25:40.005 --> 25:40.904
You're going?

25:40.973 --> 25:42.305
Ah, I've been at
this long enough

25:42.341 --> 25:44.241
I don't have to put up
with that bullshit.

25:44.376 --> 25:45.509
Louise:
<i> And what about,</i>

25:45.578 --> 25:47.645
I don't know, this?

25:47.780 --> 25:49.479
Us?

25:49.549 --> 25:50.847
I think that
our relationship

25:50.917 --> 25:53.217
Can withstand a,
a three hour drive.

25:53.352 --> 25:54.851
<i> How about you?</i>

25:56.389 --> 25:57.520
[knock on door]

25:57.557 --> 25:59.323
Reggie:
<i> Hey, there she is.</i>

25:59.325 --> 26:00.924
I heard a rumour
you were back.

26:00.927 --> 26:01.925
<i> Yeah.</i>

26:01.928 --> 26:03.360
[reg chuckles]

26:03.396 --> 26:04.894
It's really good
to see you, reg.

26:06.132 --> 26:08.666
Hey, louise.
-<i> Hey, marcie.</i>

26:08.801 --> 26:10.067
I'll catch up
with you later.

26:10.136 --> 26:11.669
Okay, bye.

26:11.804 --> 26:13.070
Bye.

26:14.340 --> 26:21.879
Well, you're resigning to
take a teaching job at upei.

26:22.014 --> 26:24.147
I thought you'd had
enough of academia.

26:24.216 --> 26:26.116
Enough of ms. Jefferson.

26:27.052 --> 26:27.984
Vivian's gone.

26:28.020 --> 26:28.952
Reggie:
<i> Is she?</i>

26:29.021 --> 26:30.153
<i> You weren't in the</i>
<i> hospital a week</i>

26:30.189 --> 26:31.088
And she put
doug in charge,

26:31.223 --> 26:33.990
Which is the one
good call she made.

26:34.026 --> 26:34.958
Why not you?

26:35.027 --> 26:36.126
Reggie:
<i> I don't know.</i>

26:36.162 --> 26:40.697
You were lying there
unresponsive in the hospital

26:40.699 --> 26:42.566
<i> And then the-the</i>
<i> reverend was dead.</i>

26:42.635 --> 26:45.102
And I mean,
to be perfectly honest,

26:45.237 --> 26:47.771
I think I was done then.

26:47.807 --> 26:51.809
<i> Doug was doing you proud,</i>
<i> but he got too close to viv.</i>

26:51.811 --> 26:53.576
They like each other,
go figure.

26:54.580 --> 26:58.015
So he let the fox in
with the chickens.

26:58.017 --> 26:59.349
Don't go.

27:00.019 --> 27:01.385
I'm, I'm back.

27:02.622 --> 27:03.787
<i> Things will get better.</i>

27:03.823 --> 27:06.190
Ah, don't kid a kidder.

27:06.192 --> 27:10.394
I love you but this is a
vivian jefferson production

27:10.463 --> 27:12.962
And until she's out,
all the way out,

27:14.000 --> 27:15.099
You're stuck.

27:15.234 --> 27:18.936
[tense music]

27:19.071 --> 27:21.805
Dr. Lawson followed his
mo on morgan's delivery:

27:21.841 --> 27:24.808
C-section followed by tubal
ligation without consent.

27:24.844 --> 27:26.209
Except with morgan
he screwed up

27:26.245 --> 27:27.878
Because morgan
was incapacitated,

27:27.880 --> 27:29.279
Didn't sign a
consent form

27:29.281 --> 27:31.615
And there was nobody there
to sign on his behalf.

27:31.750 --> 27:33.016
And we didn't want
him as a witness

27:33.052 --> 27:35.018
Because he wasn't black?

27:35.087 --> 27:37.020
Uh, viv said he didn't
fit the narrative.

27:37.089 --> 27:39.022
Basil:
<i> I need to speak</i>
<i> to a lawyer now.</i>

27:39.058 --> 27:40.190
It's what, money?

27:40.259 --> 27:42.626
Here, here, take it.

27:42.695 --> 27:44.027
It's all I've got.

27:44.096 --> 27:45.896
<i> I need someone to help me.</i>

27:45.898 --> 27:48.298
Hi, I'm marcie diggs.

27:48.300 --> 27:50.366
Basil allen.

27:50.403 --> 27:52.035
This is my lady,
trudy willis.

27:52.038 --> 27:53.103
Hi.
-Hi.

27:53.238 --> 27:55.872
Why do you need a lawyer today,
mr. Allen?

27:55.874 --> 27:56.907
Basil's from jamaica.

27:57.042 --> 27:58.374
He's a migrant worker
out in stewiacke

27:58.411 --> 28:00.176
At goldenview fields.

28:01.047 --> 28:02.813
Tell her what's going on.

28:02.948 --> 28:05.048
Basil:
<i> I need to know how to quit</i>
<i> and get another employer</i>

28:05.051 --> 28:06.650
To sponsor my permit.

28:07.653 --> 28:08.985
These people are no good,
miss diggs.

28:09.055 --> 28:10.253
<i> Them rotten.</i>

28:10.289 --> 28:11.455
Mr. Allen, this
doesn't sound like

<i> Look, we're in the middle</i>

28:16.729 --> 28:18.061
Can you come back
in two weeks

28:18.097 --> 28:19.930
And I promise you
I will get you

28:19.932 --> 28:21.865
Untangled from
your employer.

28:21.901 --> 28:23.433
She a woman of her word?

28:24.103 --> 28:25.302
Absolutely.

28:25.304 --> 28:27.538
I'll see you in two weeks,
ms. Diggs.

28:27.540 --> 28:29.206
Call me marcie.

Morgan:
<i> I was going through</i>

28:40.419 --> 28:42.485
One of the happiest
experiences of my life.

28:44.156 --> 28:47.157
Every aspect of the healthcare
system was telling me that

28:47.292 --> 28:50.426
A pregnant person who
doesn't identify as a woman

28:50.463 --> 28:51.995
Doesn't belong.

28:52.131 --> 28:54.030
<i> And whether they</i>
<i> intended it or not,</i>

28:54.166 --> 28:55.799
Your firm made me
feel the same way.

28:58.104 --> 29:02.105
I didn't fit so I
was just discarded.

29:02.108 --> 29:04.841
I am sorry that you went
through all of that.

29:06.078 --> 29:11.048
<i> Dr. Lawson hurt a lot of</i>
<i> people but we need you.</i>

29:11.183 --> 29:14.251
Honestly, if you don't testify,
he just gets away with it.

29:17.055 --> 29:19.790
He gets to go home and feel like
he was right to sterilize you

29:19.792 --> 29:21.558
And all of those
other people.

29:24.563 --> 29:26.263
<i> Don't let that happen.</i>

29:26.332 --> 29:28.097
<i> Don't just go away quietly.</i>

29:30.803 --> 29:37.074
[gentle music]

29:37.209 --> 29:39.943
They paid me $350,000.

29:43.382 --> 29:45.282
That money changes my life.

29:49.087 --> 29:51.187
Never see that in a class
action suit, would I?

29:53.225 --> 29:55.225
<i> I can't risk it.</i>

29:55.227 --> 29:56.827
I can't risk
losing that money.

29:56.829 --> 29:59.897
I can't risk dr. Lawson's
lawyers coming after me.

30:02.401 --> 30:04.101
I can't, I'm sorry.

Marcie.

30:17.382 --> 30:18.114
<i> Somebody to put the fear of</i>

30:18.184 --> 30:19.115
Rolanda:
<i> Oh, marcie.</i>

30:19.151 --> 30:20.717
Um?

30:20.786 --> 30:22.085
Okay, okay.

30:23.655 --> 30:26.957
But right now can we just
focus on this beautiful place?

30:28.227 --> 30:29.927
<i> Marcie, this is our time.</i>

30:33.199 --> 30:34.330

30:43.309 --> 30:45.742
Yeah, no,
costello wasn't there.

30:45.778 --> 30:50.013
Um, it was just rolanda
and me this time.

30:50.015 --> 30:51.514

30:54.620 --> 30:58.588
It like, it doesn't
feel like...

31:03.228 --> 31:04.528
It was joyful.

[marcie whimpering]

31:30.289 --> 31:31.621
I have to go.

31:33.725 --> 31:40.197
Marcie, whatever this thing
is that you're holding onto,

31:40.332 --> 31:42.966
<i> You're gonna have to</i>
<i> get real about it</i>

31:43.002 --> 31:45.134

<i> Unbelievable!</i>

31:50.709 --> 31:52.575
Little baby just had to go
running to momma, didn't she?

31:52.611 --> 31:53.810
Oh, go to hell, viv.

31:53.879 --> 31:55.312
I brought larissa
to the firm.

31:55.447 --> 31:56.680
It was my case to manage.

31:56.682 --> 31:57.948
Your case?

31:58.017 --> 32:00.117
I made the introductions,
viva did the outreach.

32:00.252 --> 32:02.052
You are delusional, viv.

32:02.187 --> 32:03.153
You're not a lawyer.

32:03.288 --> 32:05.221
You don't have cases.

32:05.257 --> 32:06.356
<i> Had you not interfered,</i>

32:06.425 --> 32:08.158
<i> Morgan quinn would've</i>
<i> been able to testify</i>

32:08.293 --> 32:10.026
And this would've been
a victory for larissa,

32:10.062 --> 32:11.361
But now it's too late.

32:11.496 --> 32:16.066
Of course your fearless leader
couldn't make everything better?

32:16.068 --> 32:18.067
You mean she couldn't
fix what you broke?

32:19.271 --> 32:22.172
He already agreed to a
settlement with dr. Lawson.

32:22.307 --> 32:24.240
And we could subpoena him

32:24.310 --> 32:26.642
But marcie's unwilling
to go that route.

32:26.679 --> 32:28.011
Of course.

32:35.287 --> 32:37.086
I think it's over.

32:39.725 --> 32:41.992
We were over the moment
you went running to marcie.

32:59.344 --> 33:00.210
700,000.

33:00.279 --> 33:01.278
Your case is in pieces.

33:01.280 --> 33:02.545
The only reason
we're talking

33:02.581 --> 33:04.481
Is because of dr. Lawson's
sense of generosity.

33:04.483 --> 33:05.615
Well, I'm sure the
negative publicity

33:05.684 --> 33:07.217
Isn't helping his practice.

33:11.323 --> 33:12.455
You subpoenaed him?

33:12.491 --> 33:14.057
We're done, sigmond.

33:18.297 --> 33:20.497
You signed an nda.

33:20.499 --> 33:21.664
You testify,

33:21.700 --> 33:24.267
We'll come after you for
every cent of the settlement.

33:24.336 --> 33:27.170
He robbed me of my
reproductive rights.

33:27.172 --> 33:28.438
He deserves to be punished.

Marcie:
<i> If you'll excuse us,</i>

33:29.708 --> 33:31.474
<i> We need to speak</i>

33:33.545 --> 33:34.710
It was tough some days

33:34.747 --> 33:36.646
Just going to my
prenatal appointments.

33:37.750 --> 33:39.315
Everything is gendered.

33:39.385 --> 33:40.450
All the printed material

33:40.585 --> 33:42.386
Referring to
"your new journey as a mom"

33:42.521 --> 33:44.121
Or "welcome to motherhood".

33:44.123 --> 33:46.623
Judge dewey:
<i> But you are a mother still,</i>
<i> aren't you?</i>

33:46.692 --> 33:47.624
I'm a father.

33:47.693 --> 33:49.259
My pronouns are "he", "him".

33:49.328 --> 33:50.260
I understand that

33:50.329 --> 33:53.030
But biologically
you're still a woman.

33:53.165 --> 33:55.265
Your honour, my client
identifies as "male".

33:55.400 --> 33:57.401
I'm not contesting your
witness' gender identity.

33:57.536 --> 33:59.469
But that's actually
what you're doing.

34:00.939 --> 34:02.905
Counsellor, continue
with your witness.

34:04.176 --> 34:05.208
Marcie [on live stream]:
<i> Morgan, prior to giving birth,</i>

34:05.343 --> 34:07.477
<i> Did you ever indicate</i>
<i> to dr. Lawson</i>

34:07.546 --> 34:09.479
<i> That you wanted a</i>
<i> tubal ligation?</i>

34:09.548 --> 34:10.881
Morgan:
<i> No.</i>

34:11.016 --> 34:13.183
<i> I'd been in a car accident</i>
<i> and I was unconscious.</i>

34:13.185 --> 34:14.551
So you intended to
have more children?

34:14.553 --> 34:16.319
Morgan:
<i> Maybe, I don't know.</i>

34:16.388 --> 34:18.455
I wanted that option but
he took that from me.

34:18.590 --> 34:20.290
But you identify as a man,

34:20.359 --> 34:21.491
You want to be a man.

34:21.560 --> 34:24.160
No, I am a man,
your honour.

34:24.196 --> 34:26.696
Judge dewey:
<i> So why would you</i>
<i> continue to have babies?</i>

34:26.765 --> 34:30.400
<i> Something that is the</i>
<i> sole enterprise of women.</i>

34:30.402 --> 34:32.569
I guess some people
want it both ways.

34:32.571 --> 34:34.403
What the?
-<i> Your honour!</i>

34:34.440 --> 34:35.838
Judge dewey:
<i> Counsel, my questions fall</i>
<i> within the scope of the law.</i>

34:35.840 --> 34:38.141
Your honour, I would like to
continue questioning my witness

34:38.276 --> 34:39.742
<i> Without interruption.</i>

34:40.813 --> 34:43.180
<i> Morgan, you didn't</i>
<i> sign a consent form</i>

34:43.182 --> 34:44.247
When you were admitted
to the hospital

34:44.382 --> 34:45.449
<i> To give birth, did you?</i>

34:45.584 --> 34:47.050
No, I did not.

34:47.185 --> 34:50.520
Marcie:
<i> And no one with your</i>
<i> medical power of attorney</i>

34:50.556 --> 34:52.322
Signed a consent
form on your behalf?

34:52.457 --> 34:53.723
No.

34:53.725 --> 34:56.093
Marcie:
<i> And when you</i>
<i> regained consciousness,</i>

34:56.228 --> 34:59.529
Did dr. Lawson or
anyone on his team

34:59.565 --> 35:03.133
<i> Tell you that they had</i>
<i> performed a tubal ligation</i>

35:03.202 --> 35:05.602
During your c-section?

35:05.604 --> 35:08.605
No, I, um...

35:08.607 --> 35:10.273
I only learned that
after a couple of years

35:10.408 --> 35:11.675
When my partner and
I were looking into

35:11.810 --> 35:13.576
<i> Having another child.</i>

35:13.612 --> 35:14.611
Thank you.

35:14.613 --> 35:16.212
Judge dewey:
<i> Mr. Reichert.</i>

35:17.449 --> 35:19.549
Isn't it true your
pregnancy was unplanned?

35:19.618 --> 35:20.617
Yes, but I-

35:20.619 --> 35:22.418
In fact you were
scheduled for a grs,

35:22.454 --> 35:23.887

35:23.889 --> 35:25.155
Prior to learning
of your pregnancy,

35:25.290 --> 35:26.222
<i> Isn't that right?</i>

35:26.358 --> 35:27.724
Yes, but I-

35:27.726 --> 35:29.025
<i> Didn't you breakdown in</i>
<i> tears in dr. Lawson's office</i>

35:29.061 --> 35:31.361
<i> Because you were so upset</i>
<i> about your pregnancy</i>

35:31.496 --> 35:33.997
And having to
cancel your grs?

35:34.066 --> 35:35.264
I-I wasn't upset.

35:35.300 --> 35:37.066
Ah, but you were seeking
abortion counselling.

35:37.102 --> 35:38.801
Objection!

Judge dewey:
<i> Sit down, ms. Diggs.</i>
<i> I wanna hear this testimony.</i>

35:40.639 --> 35:43.172

<i> You did tell dr. Lawson that</i>
<i> you wanted to be referred</i>

35:43.208 --> 35:44.374
To planned parenthood

35:44.443 --> 35:46.442
Because you were seeking
abortion counselling.

35:46.444 --> 35:49.045
Shouldn't every pregnant
person have that option?

35:50.081 --> 35:51.914
Morgan, I'm curious,

35:51.916 --> 35:54.384
<i> You're in a loving,</i>

35:54.386 --> 35:56.586

<i> Sounds like a great</i>
<i> place to raise a child.</i>

36:00.392 --> 36:02.726
So why were you seeking
abortion counselling?

36:04.830 --> 36:06.129
<i> Morgan?</i>

36:07.131 --> 36:10.233
[morgan crying softly]

36:11.203 --> 36:13.469
'cause I didn't wanna
be in that body.

36:13.471 --> 36:15.404
Right, 'cause you're a man

36:17.342 --> 36:18.475
And men don't have babies.

36:18.477 --> 36:19.943
Objection, your honour!

36:19.945 --> 36:21.277
Sigmond:
<i> Isn't it true that</i>
<i> you asked dr. Lawson</i>

36:21.313 --> 36:23.446
<i> To perform tubal ligation</i>
<i> after giving birth</i>

36:23.515 --> 36:25.315
Because you didn't want
any more children?

Objection, your honour.

36:27.019 --> 36:28.518
Sigmond:
<i> Isn't it true that you</i>
<i> created this entire narrative</i>

36:28.520 --> 36:30.687
Because you wanted to save
face with your partner?

36:30.689 --> 36:32.122
Marcie:
<i> Judge dewey!</i>

36:32.124 --> 36:33.323
Judge dewey:
<i> Ms. Diggs, there's</i>
<i> nothing wrong</i>

36:33.325 --> 36:35.124
With mr. Reichert's questions.

36:35.160 --> 36:37.027
In your earlier testimony,

36:37.162 --> 36:38.228
You mentioned that
you and your partner

36:38.363 --> 36:40.597
Were considering
having more children.

36:40.732 --> 36:43.300
<i> But you,</i>

36:43.302 --> 36:44.367
You don't wanna
have another child,

36:44.502 --> 36:45.802
Do you, morgan?

36:47.639 --> 36:49.372
<i> You're under oath, morgan.</i>

36:49.507 --> 36:51.040
Don't forget.

36:54.513 --> 36:56.379
It wasn't his choice!

36:56.514 --> 36:57.847
It was my choice!

36:57.983 --> 36:59.249
Mine!

37:00.518 --> 37:02.452
Thank you, morgan.

Why you want to withdraw your
recommendation of loretta

37:18.503 --> 37:20.903
To the court of appeal,
then I'm not comfortable.

37:20.973 --> 37:24.207
She's transphobic, homophobic.

37:24.209 --> 37:27.377
I mean, her conduct in
court today was astonishing.

37:27.379 --> 37:30.146
If I could have her removed
from the bench, I would.

37:30.182 --> 37:31.748
That's strong.

just told you,

Do you think judge dewey
deserves to be on the bench?

We're a tiny family.

laundry in the dryer,

37:42.761 --> 37:44.260
Not on the line.

37:47.565 --> 37:49.032
I want you to call
the minister's office

37:49.167 --> 37:50.433
And rescind my
recommendation.

37:50.568 --> 37:52.568
And if they ask why?

Don't hide the truth

Marcie:
<i> The way that you just</i>

I would stop if I were you.

Marcie:
<i> You should be ashamed.</i>

38:39.818 --> 38:40.950
You know, I'm sitting
here wondering

38:41.019 --> 38:42.885
Whether or not justice
can actually be obtained

38:42.954 --> 38:44.220
In a courtroom anymore.

38:44.222 --> 38:45.488
You have managed to
change this courtroom

38:45.557 --> 38:47.490
Into a place where
fear resides,

38:47.625 --> 38:49.325
Like a-like a haunted house.

38:50.762 --> 38:54.497
You know, you're a ghoul.

You clearly continue
to suffer the effects

38:58.236 --> 39:01.438
Of the violent
assault you endured.

39:01.440 --> 39:04.441
<i> However, for your sake,</i>
