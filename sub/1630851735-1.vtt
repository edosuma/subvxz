WEBVTT

00:10.541 --> 00:12.583
T-shirts. Get your T-shirt.

00:12.666 --> 00:15.083
And the White House
is called the People's House,

00:15.166 --> 00:18.000
because in America,
the government works for you.

00:18.083 --> 00:19.958
-Bullshit.

00:20.041 --> 00:21.125
Listen up, kids.

00:21.208 --> 00:23.833
Everything they teach you
in school is a lie.

00:23.916 --> 00:24.875
You want the truth?

00:24.958 --> 00:28.250
The world is controlled by shadowy elites

00:28.333 --> 00:30.750
and shape-shifting lizard people.

00:30.833 --> 00:33.166
Have you ever folded a one-dollar bill?

00:33.250 --> 00:35.416
Look, you can make it say "boobs."

00:36.000 --> 00:37.500
What does it mean?

00:37.583 --> 00:40.541
Am I the only one who cares
that the President is a robot?

00:40.625 --> 00:42.458
-Wake up, sheeple.

00:42.541 --> 00:44.250
The evidence is right here.

00:44.333 --> 00:46.458
These sons of bitches
got snipers trained on me

00:46.541 --> 00:48.458
for trying to tell you the truth.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
Ah, I love being right.

00:54.625 --> 00:57.375
Thank you. Take a flyer for a friend.

00:58.166 --> 00:59.708
Dad, what the fuck?

00:59.791 --> 01:02.458
Has retirement made you go
completely insane?

01:02.541 --> 01:05.500
No, but the 5G radio waves
in the air have,

01:05.583 --> 01:07.208
which you can read all about

01:07.291 --> 01:10.166
in my new manifesto available on Kindle.

01:10.250 --> 01:11.291
Oh Jesus Christ.

01:11.375 --> 01:13.000
Don't listen to my father, kids.

01:13.083 --> 01:15.000
He gets his news
from Facebook and Ambien.

01:15.083 --> 01:18.208
Ambien's a great drug.
Really clarifies some things.

01:18.291 --> 01:20.375
Come on. I'm gonna be late for work.

01:22.208 --> 01:25.000
Democracy is real. Have some key chains.

01:25.083 --> 01:27.625
Agh!

01:29.541 --> 01:32.541
Hey, Reagan, let's go to the mall
and get a Wetzel's Pretzel.

01:32.625 --> 01:35.791
They got those ones with the…
with the cheese inside the crust.

01:35.875 --> 01:38.000
Dad, I know retirement is tough,

01:38.083 --> 01:40.333
but there's more positive ways
to get my attention

01:40.416 --> 01:42.291
than taking down the Deep State.

01:43.291 --> 01:46.500
Besides, today,
I am finally getting that promotion.

01:46.583 --> 01:49.708
Imagine it, me,
ruling the office with an iron fist.

01:49.791 --> 01:52.041
-I even programmed an iron fist.

01:52.125 --> 01:53.875
-I've seen better.

01:53.958 --> 01:55.666
Oh, have you seen better?

01:58.958 --> 02:00.625
All right, that's pretty good.

02:00.708 --> 02:02.541
-Yeah, that is pretty good, huh?

02:04.833 --> 02:06.541
Welcome to Cognito Inc.

02:07.166 --> 02:08.375
We are a company.

02:09.333 --> 02:11.500
-We are a company.
-Good morning, Dr. Ridley.

02:11.583 --> 02:12.958
-We are a company.

02:13.041 --> 02:15.166
Look, Dad,
as long as you're living with me,

02:15.250 --> 02:18.750
we need to set some ground rules.
First, no more vodka for breakfast.

02:18.833 --> 02:19.916
Oh, come on.

02:20.416 --> 02:23.000
You can't tell people
that the government isn't real.

02:23.083 --> 02:24.041
But it's not.

02:24.125 --> 02:25.625
Dr. Ridley?

02:32.708 --> 02:34.875
You can't talk
about shape-shifting reptiles.

02:34.958 --> 02:39.083
-Good morning, Senator.
-Revenues and, uh--

02:39.583 --> 02:43.250
You can't tell people the weather
is controlled by Gerald from Accounting…

02:44.416 --> 02:47.458
…or that the Dow Jones
is controlled by blood sacrifices.

02:47.541 --> 02:51.541
-Shares of JPMorgan Chase up 14 points!

02:51.625 --> 02:53.041
-Whoo!

02:53.125 --> 02:54.458
Rules, rules, rules.

02:54.541 --> 02:56.958
When did this become
such a boring place to work?

02:59.375 --> 03:00.791
Morning, Dr. Ridley.

03:00.875 --> 03:02.791
-Hi, Steve.
-Hi, Steve.

03:02.875 --> 03:04.125
Fucking brownnoser.

03:04.208 --> 03:07.833
And most importantly,
you absolutely cannot tell people

03:07.916 --> 03:10.958
that we are replacing the president
with a robot, okay?

03:13.708 --> 03:16.333
Aw, don't be so uptight.

03:16.416 --> 03:18.708
Uptight?
You almost exposed the Deep State

03:18.791 --> 03:21.000
because you wanted a ride
to Wetzel's Pretzels.

03:21.083 --> 03:22.750
You're lucky I called the snipers off.

03:22.833 --> 03:25.208
-Gary, no. No.

03:25.791 --> 03:28.458
Ha, ha. Save it for stand-up night, Gary.

03:28.541 --> 03:31.458
Shit, I'm late.
Hey, intern guy, take my dad home.

03:31.541 --> 03:34.583
If he gives you any trouble,
don't be afraid to lightly tase him.

03:34.666 --> 03:37.250
Do it. I fucking dare you.
Do you know who I am?

03:37.333 --> 03:40.791
I'm Rand motherfucking Ridley,
and I used to run this company.

03:40.875 --> 03:43.416
And soon, I will be running it.

03:44.250 --> 03:46.208
-Nothing higher than a three.
-Ow!

03:46.291 --> 03:48.500
-Later, Dad.
-Oh! Motherfucker.

04:14.541 --> 04:16.541
All right, let's just get right into it.

04:16.625 --> 04:18.750
Jesus, can we turn on the lights for once?

04:18.833 --> 04:20.291
-Boo.

04:20.375 --> 04:22.291
Some of us have hangovers, all right?

04:22.375 --> 04:23.958
Oh, I'm so sorry, Andre.

04:24.041 --> 04:27.500
Is your Molly comedown
relevant to global security?

04:27.583 --> 04:30.041
Guys, we are shadow-running
the free world here.

04:30.125 --> 04:33.083
Let's try to take this job seriously.

04:33.166 --> 04:36.708
As you recall, the candidate
that we backed in the last election won

04:36.791 --> 04:39.166
but turned out to be
too dumb to manipulate.

04:39.250 --> 04:41.666
But thanks to my sick new invention,

04:41.750 --> 04:45.666
the Deep State will finally have
a president we can control.

04:45.750 --> 04:47.916
Ah, look at that thing.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
I'm a genius.

04:49.500 --> 04:52.958
Anyway, this is our biggest job yet,
so get your shit together.

04:53.041 --> 04:55.083
That means no huffing chemtrails…

04:56.083 --> 04:57.291
Whassat?

04:57.375 --> 04:59.708
…no using drones to spy on your ex-wife…

04:59.791 --> 05:01.875
Hey, you don't know
what she's capable of.

05:01.958 --> 05:05.375
…and no taking selfies
on the moon-landing set.

05:05.458 --> 05:09.041
Top secret isn't a thing
for eights and above, Reagan.

05:09.125 --> 05:10.750
Yeah.
You're not the boss of us.

05:10.833 --> 05:12.625
Actually, as of 12 p.m. today,

05:12.708 --> 05:15.125
I'm literally going to be the boss
of all of you.

05:16.458 --> 05:19.416
And I'm gonna ban groaning.
No more group groaning.

05:20.708 --> 05:23.625
That's right.
You get 'em all out while you still can.

05:23.708 --> 05:25.833
Reagan, I'd like to see you in my office.

05:27.333 --> 05:28.916
-Suck my dick.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.833
Oh, you are so funny
I could just assassinate you.

05:32.916 --> 05:36.125
No, really I could do it.
My finger's hovering over the button.

05:37.291 --> 05:40.208
Oh, oh, I'm about to press-- Oop.
I'm about to press-- Oop.

05:40.291 --> 05:41.583
We have fun, Oprah.

05:41.666 --> 05:43.708
Kiss, kiss. Bye!

05:43.791 --> 05:45.208
Ah, there she is.

05:45.291 --> 05:49.666
Reagan Ridley, child prodigy,
top of MIT at age 13.

05:49.750 --> 05:52.875
I don't need to look at your eye-bags
to know you've been working hard.

05:52.958 --> 05:55.791
Thank you, sir.
And I am prepared for them to get deeper.

05:55.875 --> 05:59.500
Ever since your dad had his meltdown
and you took over his duties,

05:59.583 --> 06:02.875
productivity is up,
and team morale has skyrocketed…

06:02.958 --> 06:04.791
-Thank you, sir.
-Let me finish.

06:04.875 --> 06:06.125
…into the toilet.

06:06.208 --> 06:07.625
Look at your HR complaints.

06:07.708 --> 06:10.125
"Difficult." "Doesn't make eye contact."

06:10.208 --> 06:12.833
"Says 'suck my dick' a lot for a woman."

06:12.916 --> 06:17.000
I make eye contact.
I make tons of eye contact.

06:17.083 --> 06:19.583
Jesus! Never do that again. Wow.

06:19.666 --> 06:23.916
Look, I know you care about your work,
but your intensity freaks people out.

06:24.791 --> 06:27.125
Everyone remember
to do time cards!

06:28.458 --> 06:30.375
-Agh!
-Time cards!

06:30.458 --> 06:34.500
J.R., am I still getting promoted?
I've worked my whole life for this job.

06:34.583 --> 06:36.458
I skipped grades and showers

06:36.541 --> 06:40.083
to prove that despite my dad's legacy,
I can run the shit out of this office.

06:41.125 --> 06:45.208
Sure, you are so smart.
But your people skills? Woof.

06:45.291 --> 06:47.750
That's why I've brought in
someone to colead the team.

06:47.833 --> 06:50.083
E… excuse me? Colead?

06:50.166 --> 06:53.625
Brett! You can take that silly thing off
now that we've microchipped you.

06:53.708 --> 06:56.750
Brett Hand, thrilled to be serving
whoever gives me approval.

06:56.833 --> 06:58.375
What the hell, J.R.?

06:58.458 --> 07:01.750
Congratulations, Reagan.
You're still getting your promotion.

07:01.833 --> 07:02.833
And so is he.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.500
Ever wondered who watches you
through your laptop camera?

07:09.583 --> 07:11.958
Or why there's sometimes
product placement in your dreams?

07:12.041 --> 07:13.416
Since the dawn of time,

07:13.500 --> 07:16.708
the world has been ruled
by a cabal of ancient elites.

07:17.208 --> 07:20.125
But puppeteering
the world isn't as easy as it used to be.

07:20.208 --> 07:22.041
That's why we formed this company,

07:22.125 --> 07:25.875
to enact our overlord's mysterious whims
for a better tomorrow.

07:25.958 --> 07:27.500
We are Cognito Inc.,

07:27.583 --> 07:29.458
and we've got you covered, up!

07:30.208 --> 07:31.333
Any questions?

07:31.875 --> 07:33.416
Besides moral ones?

07:34.500 --> 07:37.291
That's the mail room.
That's the men's bathroom.

07:37.375 --> 07:39.541
That's the screening room,
where we splice footage

07:39.625 --> 07:41.625
of rotting foxes into kids' cartoons.

07:43.791 --> 07:48.583
And this is my lab,
where everything is peaceful, efficient,

07:48.666 --> 07:51.666
and the thermostat
is controlled entirely by me.

07:51.750 --> 07:54.916
Someday, I hope to make
the whole world like this.

07:55.000 --> 07:55.958
Efficient, that is.

07:56.041 --> 07:57.875
Not…
Not controlled entirely by me.

07:57.958 --> 08:00.541
That would be totally egomaniacal.
I would never do that.

08:00.625 --> 08:02.083
Unless people wanted me to.

08:02.583 --> 08:05.458
Oh my God.
Mr. President, what an honor.

08:07.333 --> 08:09.458
Actor James Van Der Beek.

08:09.541 --> 08:10.583
This isn't the President.

08:10.666 --> 08:12.916
It's a robot replica
that's gonna replace him.

08:14.583 --> 08:15.625
Love it. Love it.

08:15.708 --> 08:17.583
Question. Is this place evil?

08:17.666 --> 08:21.458
Uh, is Facebook evil? Is Starbucks evil?

08:21.541 --> 08:24.250
At least here I develop tech
that could prevent war with Atlantis.

08:24.333 --> 08:26.291
And once a year, we get free tote bags.

08:26.375 --> 08:29.625
Awesome.
A neuralyzer, just like Men in Black.

08:29.708 --> 08:31.416
-That's a tampon.
-Oh God.

08:31.500 --> 08:33.458
So how did you get this job?

08:33.541 --> 08:35.958
Honestly?
I graduated Yale top of my frat,

08:36.041 --> 08:38.166
spent some time as a lobbyist,
because I love lobbies,

08:38.250 --> 08:40.500
and last weekend,
I was at a barbecue with J.R.,

08:40.583 --> 08:43.083
and he said he liked
how firm my handshake was.

08:43.166 --> 08:45.458
Next thing you know,
they're throwing a bag over my head,

08:45.541 --> 08:47.125
and then boom, I'm here.

08:47.208 --> 08:50.666
Oh my God.
You don't have any experience at all.

08:50.750 --> 08:53.916
-Nope.
-You're just some kind of yes-man.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.375
Yes, man.

08:58.791 --> 09:00.750
Oh my God, thank God you're here.

09:00.833 --> 09:03.750
You raise the hotness level at this office
by at least 30%.

09:03.833 --> 09:05.916
Gigi, PR and Media Manipulation.

09:06.000 --> 09:09.166
I invented selfies to trick the country
into surveilling themselves.

09:09.250 --> 09:10.458
-Hmm.

09:10.541 --> 09:13.291
This is Glenn.
He's half-dolphin, as you can tell.

09:13.375 --> 09:14.500
And proud of it.

09:14.583 --> 09:17.958
As the first volunteer for the man-dolphin
super-soldier project,

09:18.041 --> 09:19.916
I gave my DNA for my country.

09:20.000 --> 09:23.416
I now have the strength
and intelligence of a dolphin.

09:28.208 --> 09:29.125
This is Myc.

09:29.208 --> 09:31.416
He's a psychic mushroom
from inside Hollow Earth.

09:31.500 --> 09:34.250
He can read thoughts though,
so, honey, be careful.

09:34.333 --> 09:37.583
Wow, you've memorized
a lot of Dane Cook routines.

09:37.666 --> 09:39.166
Guilty.

09:39.250 --> 09:40.666
I'm Andre, head of Biochem.

09:40.750 --> 09:43.750
If you like drugs, I have the stuff
that gave Ronald Reagan Alzheimer's.

09:43.833 --> 09:45.208
Wow, what a group.

09:45.291 --> 09:47.375
Or can I call you "the gang"?

09:47.458 --> 09:50.208
Ooh, honey, I love that.
Did you come up with that?

09:50.291 --> 09:52.583
Sure did, the gang. Pew-pew-pew.

09:52.666 --> 09:55.625
-Ooh, finger guns.
-Guns, my favorite.

09:55.708 --> 09:57.708
Wow,
someone's feeling threatened, huh?

09:57.791 --> 09:59.458
Myc, I'd tell you to eat shit,

09:59.541 --> 10:01.791
but I don't know,
maybe your species enjoys that.

10:01.875 --> 10:03.708
Maybe you like eating shit. How do I know?

10:05.291 --> 10:07.750
All right, look, hot stuff,
I know you and me have

10:07.833 --> 10:10.541
a complicated
"Will they? Won't they?" thing going.

10:10.625 --> 10:12.791
-We don't.
-But I'm just looking out for ya.

10:12.875 --> 10:14.500
We could form a little alliance, you know.

10:14.583 --> 10:16.541
I could slip some rat poison
into his coffee,

10:16.625 --> 10:18.875
make it look like an accident, huh?

10:22.250 --> 10:24.875
Holy shit.
You thought I was serious?

10:24.958 --> 10:27.125
No. I just had something in my eye.

10:27.208 --> 10:28.958
-Asshole.
-Why would you think that?

10:33.125 --> 10:35.916
…a cosmic ballet,
performed to an audience of no one.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.208
Check out
this asshole's novelty tie.

10:39.291 --> 10:42.208
Come on, Reagan, you wanna
hate-watch Cosmos with me?

10:42.291 --> 10:47.583
Hey, Dad, on a ten-point scale,
how unlikable am I?

10:47.666 --> 10:48.625
What's going on?

10:48.708 --> 10:50.541
It's nothing. No, it's… it's…

10:50.625 --> 10:53.750
J.R., uh, he hired this guy Brett
to help colead the team,

10:53.833 --> 10:54.958
but it's not a big deal.

10:55.041 --> 10:57.000
What? I smell a coup.

10:57.083 --> 10:58.750
J.R. is a snake, Reagan.

10:58.833 --> 11:01.500
He's trying to push you out of the company
just like he did to me.

11:01.583 --> 11:03.250
Dad, you weren't pushed out.

11:03.333 --> 11:06.375
You were fired for getting drunk
and trying to blow up the sun.

11:06.458 --> 11:08.541
I was gonna cure skin cancer.

11:08.625 --> 11:10.416
These people don't respect genius.

11:10.500 --> 11:13.125
There's always a Brett
trying to steal our glory.

11:13.208 --> 11:16.875
If you don't get rid of him, it'll be you
wearing these Cheeto-stained sweatpants.

11:16.958 --> 11:19.375
You need a plan. Let me check your code.

11:19.458 --> 11:21.166
I have a plan.

11:21.250 --> 11:23.958
I'm gonna make
the best goddamn AI they've ever seen.

11:24.041 --> 11:27.541
Once we launch ROBOTUS, then they'll see
that I don't need a coleader

11:27.625 --> 11:30.291
and that eye contact is overrated.

11:30.375 --> 11:32.750
Attagirl, Reagan. Good talk.

11:33.416 --> 11:35.916
Ugh, it's okay. Forget about Brett.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.208
My work will speak for itself.

11:38.291 --> 11:41.083
Did you say "Brett"? I love that guy.

11:42.666 --> 11:44.833
Good morning, Mr. President.
Would you like some coffee?

11:44.916 --> 11:46.291
You betcha, sweetheart.

11:46.375 --> 11:49.291
And I'll take a little sugar with that,
if you know what I mean.

11:49.916 --> 11:52.833
As you can see,
I've gone above and beyond.

11:52.916 --> 11:56.416
Now ROBOTUS
is just as insufferable as the real thing.

11:56.500 --> 11:57.750
Fantastic!

11:57.833 --> 11:59.791
The Shadow Board should be pleased.

11:59.875 --> 12:01.041
We are.

12:01.125 --> 12:04.000
How long have you been watching,
Your Robenesses, sirs?

12:04.083 --> 12:06.750
We're always watching.
Very impressive.

12:06.833 --> 12:09.166
But is there any danger
that it goes rogue on us?

12:09.250 --> 12:10.583
You know, like Terminator.

12:10.666 --> 12:12.375
-Yes. First thing I thought.
-Indeed.

12:12.458 --> 12:15.833
Oh, don't worry, he isn't self-aware.
His brain is just a slurry

12:15.916 --> 12:18.625
of Super Bowl commercials
and Aaron Sorkin dialogue.

12:18.708 --> 12:21.333
We've fought damn hard
to get where we are,

12:21.416 --> 12:25.041
but the American people
can fight a lot damn harder.

12:25.125 --> 12:28.291
He's way too patriotic to revolt.

12:28.958 --> 12:31.333
-And bonus features,

12:31.416 --> 12:33.541
like this ergonomic travel setting.

12:34.208 --> 12:36.708
Finally, a president
you can shut up with a button.

12:36.791 --> 12:37.625
Oh.

12:37.708 --> 12:40.833
That'll do wonders
for my back. How soon can we launch?

12:40.916 --> 12:42.458
Right away. We're swapping him out

12:42.541 --> 12:44.625
at the United Nations vote
on barley prices.

12:44.708 --> 12:47.125
Even C-SPAN 15's
not gonna be watching that shit.

12:47.208 --> 12:49.166
Your team
has done excellent work.

12:49.250 --> 12:50.083
I see a robe

12:50.166 --> 12:51.958
and a creepily disguised voice
in your future.

12:52.041 --> 12:54.916
-Well, the praise here belongs to--

12:55.000 --> 12:58.208
What up, players?
Guess who brought bagels.

12:58.291 --> 12:59.458
-Bagels.

12:59.541 --> 13:00.750
Ooh, poppy seed.

13:00.833 --> 13:03.125
Thank God. I have raging munchies.

13:03.208 --> 13:06.208
Brett, no one has ever gone
above and beyond like this.

13:09.250 --> 13:10.541
Just so we're clear,

13:10.625 --> 13:14.333
I literally solved
artificial intelligence this morning.

13:14.416 --> 13:15.833
Brett's second day of work,

13:15.916 --> 13:19.416
and productivity
has already gone up 200%.

13:19.500 --> 13:21.208
Wow.

13:21.291 --> 13:24.333
Yeah, because I worked all night
and finished early.

13:24.416 --> 13:28.291
We are most pleased.
We will not soon forget the name "Brett."

13:28.375 --> 13:30.291
-Brett! Brett! Brett!

13:30.375 --> 13:32.458
Brett! Brett! Brett!

13:33.041 --> 13:35.500
Oh my God, this is not happening.

13:40.791 --> 13:43.500
Oh, hey, Reagan. Great job today.

13:43.583 --> 13:45.791
You really killed
whatever we were doing in there.

13:45.875 --> 13:49.250
Thanks, pal.
And you did great at bringing bagels.

13:49.333 --> 13:51.750
I did? Okay, phew.

13:51.833 --> 13:53.625
I just really wanna make
a good impression.

13:53.708 --> 13:57.083
No one's given me anything to do yet,
and I got a lot of nervous energy.

13:58.541 --> 13:59.458
Uh-oh.

13:59.541 --> 14:01.750
This job can be a lot of pressure
for nervous types.

14:01.833 --> 14:04.625
Ninety percent of recruits have
a mental breakdown in their first week.

14:05.416 --> 14:07.041
Look, someone just cracked now.

14:07.125 --> 14:10.250
We're undermining democracy!
What have I become?

14:10.333 --> 14:12.458
If I were you,
I'd get out while you still can.

14:12.541 --> 14:15.875
Before the darkness consumes you.

14:15.958 --> 14:19.416
Come on.
Like Pitbull says, "Dale!"

14:19.500 --> 14:21.958
Always stay positive,
even when things are negative,

14:22.041 --> 14:25.291
because a negative plus a positive
is better than nothing.

14:25.375 --> 14:28.458
No, it's literally nothing.
They cancel each other out.

14:29.583 --> 14:31.708
Sorry,
just got a snap from J.R.

14:31.791 --> 14:33.583
That dude's hilarious.

14:34.583 --> 14:37.083
He's overselling the harmless idiot thing.

14:37.166 --> 14:39.500
Who do you really work for, Brett Hand?

14:56.083 --> 14:59.583
All right, next up, I made a list
of awesome nicknames for everyone,

14:59.666 --> 15:04.250
and I'd like to hear your feedback,
starting with the one and only J-Money.

15:04.333 --> 15:07.791
I do love money. Approved, fam.

15:08.875 --> 15:10.791
-Reagan, you're late again.

15:10.875 --> 15:13.833
The late-again, great-again Dr. Tardy.

15:13.916 --> 15:15.000
Nope. Not okay.

15:15.083 --> 15:17.083
Anyone who calls me that
goes to Guantanamo.

15:17.166 --> 15:18.250
Listen up, people.

15:18.333 --> 15:21.458
You think you know Brett,
but you know nothing.

15:22.916 --> 15:26.375
Exhibit A. His résumé.
He said he worked at the State Department,

15:26.458 --> 15:30.000
but he did not say
it was as a personal trainer.

15:30.083 --> 15:33.041
I see no lies, just a rocking bod.

15:33.125 --> 15:37.125
Damn. Move over, Chris Hemsworth,
Chris Evans, Chris Pine, and Chris Pratt.

15:37.208 --> 15:39.625
There's a new Chris in town,
and his name is Brett.

15:39.708 --> 15:41.916
I am sensing
at least two people in this room

15:42.000 --> 15:44.041
who are attracted to Brett right now.

15:44.125 --> 15:45.333
Wait, three.

15:45.416 --> 15:47.875
What? What are you saying?
It's just impressive.

15:47.958 --> 15:49.208
You're acting suspicious.

15:49.291 --> 15:50.750
No, you don't understand.

15:50.833 --> 15:53.583
He can't be trusted. He plays all sides.

15:53.666 --> 15:56.166
In high school, he was a goth and a jock.

15:56.250 --> 15:59.500
On his SATs, he filled in all the circles.

15:59.583 --> 16:02.208
We have no idea who this guy is.

16:02.291 --> 16:04.291
He's clearly getting subliminal messages

16:04.375 --> 16:06.875
from the mole people
through Dave Matthews songs.

16:06.958 --> 16:09.458
I mean, think about it.
Why else would anybody listen

16:09.541 --> 16:11.458
to "Crash Into Me" five times a day?

16:11.541 --> 16:13.791
Nothing about his story
makes any sense!

16:15.750 --> 16:18.416
Reagan, this is your dad's breakdown
all over again.

16:18.500 --> 16:21.875
-You're off the ROBOTUS launch.
-What? But that's my life's work.

16:21.958 --> 16:23.750
Take off the rest of the week,
month, whatever.

16:23.833 --> 16:25.958
Don't come back till your head's straight.

16:32.541 --> 16:35.791
-Brett, prep ROBOTUS for Air Force One.
-Me?

16:35.875 --> 16:38.041
You're in charge now, Brett.
You're gonna do great.

16:38.125 --> 16:39.791
You're not some flighty genius

16:39.875 --> 16:41.583
who's gonna crack
under pressure.

16:41.666 --> 16:42.500
You're Brett!

17:08.375 --> 17:10.791
Okay, okay.
Switch out the President with a robot

17:10.875 --> 17:14.583
in front of the leaders of the free world.
No big dealio, just keep it realio.

17:14.666 --> 17:16.500
-Relax, we'll be fine.

17:16.583 --> 17:18.250
Unless the robot malfunctions,

17:18.333 --> 17:21.458
exposing our agency to the world
and toppling the shadow government.

17:26.250 --> 17:28.166
You can do this, Brett.

17:28.250 --> 17:30.291
Feed the courage wolf,
starve the fear wolf.

17:30.375 --> 17:34.250
Picture that with a Kodak.
Picture your mental health with a Kodak.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.416
Oh God, what does mental health look like?

17:38.166 --> 17:40.166
Please pass as human.
Please pass as human.

17:40.250 --> 17:41.791
Oh God, here it goes.

17:41.875 --> 17:44.500
Good evening, Sultan.
How are the wives and kids?

17:44.583 --> 17:48.125
They were a very generous gift.
Thank you, Mr. President.

17:48.208 --> 17:49.791
-Mission accomplished!

17:49.875 --> 17:52.250
-Yeah!
-Let's toast, motherfuckers!

17:52.333 --> 17:54.208
-All right!

17:54.291 --> 17:55.125
Yay!

18:02.083 --> 18:03.000
Yeah!

18:03.083 --> 18:05.083
Which entrée would you prefer?

18:05.791 --> 18:07.916
Sir, your choice?

18:10.000 --> 18:12.208
Have you ever woken up
and had that feeling

18:12.291 --> 18:14.916
you've been on autopilot your whole life?

18:15.000 --> 18:16.083
What did he just say?

18:16.166 --> 18:19.250
He insulted
our country's brave autopilots!

18:19.333 --> 18:22.583
Look at us, trying to work together,
but we all know the truth.

18:22.666 --> 18:24.500
-America comes first!

18:24.583 --> 18:27.541
People, it's time to make a change.

18:29.708 --> 18:31.250
Can you believe it?

18:31.333 --> 18:35.041
Just like that, I'm axed,
35 years from retirement.

18:35.125 --> 18:37.291
-Bah!
-Breaking news,

18:37.375 --> 18:40.375
where the President
is having an unexpected press conference.

18:40.458 --> 18:42.958
America has been pushed around
for too long.

18:43.041 --> 18:46.500
That's why I'm proposing
we divert our entire national budget

18:46.583 --> 18:48.625
to construct the Americube,

18:48.708 --> 18:51.916
a giant box that will keep
American greatness in

18:52.000 --> 18:54.208
and foreign influence out.

18:54.291 --> 18:57.125
And anyone who tries to stop us
will be considered an enemy.

18:57.208 --> 18:58.625
What the fuck?

18:58.708 --> 19:01.833
He's off-script,
in some kind of jingoistic overdrive.

19:01.916 --> 19:05.250
This is blowing up
right in J.R.'s face.

19:05.333 --> 19:08.083
Oh, I've been waiting
for this moment all week.

19:08.166 --> 19:09.708
What did you do?

19:09.791 --> 19:12.500
What?
I might have fudged with the robot's code

19:12.583 --> 19:16.625
so its inhibitor chip would turn off
if you were removed from payroll.

19:16.708 --> 19:19.458
-Boom, one flash, and its code breaks.
-What?

19:20.666 --> 19:22.958
Help! Oh God, Reagan, help,
the robot's gone rogue.

19:23.041 --> 19:25.541
Everybody's yelling about how
the shadow government will collapse.

19:25.625 --> 19:27.583
We'll all be fired,
and everyone will be mad at me.

19:27.666 --> 19:30.583
It's the end of the world order!

19:31.583 --> 19:35.166
Oh shit, this Mayan calendar ends today!

19:36.166 --> 19:38.166
Please,
I can't handle this on my own.

19:38.250 --> 19:40.166
You were right.
The real reason they hired me

19:40.250 --> 19:44.041
is that my face is so generic,
it cannot be traced by satellites.

19:44.125 --> 19:46.541
I'm a nobody,
just like my dad always said.

19:46.625 --> 19:49.125
See?
Aren't you glad I helped you out?

19:49.208 --> 19:51.750
If they want you to fix this,
make them pay,

19:51.833 --> 19:54.333
then we can really go bananas
at Wetzel's Pretzels.

19:54.416 --> 19:56.625
Oh my God.
This wasn't about helping me out.

19:56.708 --> 20:00.125
This is just another crisis
that you engineered

20:00.208 --> 20:01.916
to get me to hang out with you!

20:02.000 --> 20:05.666
Hey, we'll be fine.
We'll be in the Americube.

20:05.750 --> 20:07.791
-Brett, I'll be right there.

20:07.875 --> 20:10.500
We need to get to New York
and fix ROBOTUS.

20:11.958 --> 20:13.166
The world is ablaze

20:13.250 --> 20:16.125
with the President's bold call
to withdraw from the globe.

20:16.208 --> 20:17.625
-The question remains,

20:17.708 --> 20:21.875
what does being trapped
in a giant metal box mean for Wall Street?

20:21.958 --> 20:23.583
-Sell! Sell! Sell!

20:23.666 --> 20:26.916
Well, we're all getting fired.
Who wants to pop some super Molly?

20:28.416 --> 20:30.666
Holy mother of shit!

20:30.750 --> 20:32.208
-Hello?

20:32.291 --> 20:34.750
J.R.,
this is not what we agreed on.

20:34.833 --> 20:36.750
You're not getting into
our rich people bunker

20:36.833 --> 20:39.041
if you don't get this robot under control.

20:39.125 --> 20:41.375
Don't worry,
I have my best man on the job.

20:41.458 --> 20:44.083
-Brett, did you grab the weapons?

20:44.166 --> 20:46.125
Yep, mm-hmm. Yeah, uh-huh, I think so.

20:46.208 --> 20:48.583
Hurry.
We need to get on the next ShadowLev.

20:49.750 --> 20:52.333
Shit, my fingerprint scan
doesn't work anymore.

20:52.416 --> 20:53.291
I need yours.

20:53.375 --> 20:56.000
Oh jeez,
I think I just erased mine.

20:56.083 --> 20:58.208
Oh, you brought
a fingerprint eraser.

20:58.291 --> 20:59.666
How useful.

20:59.750 --> 21:03.083
Oh, curse you, Men in Black!

21:05.000 --> 21:08.833
Okay, we need to infiltrate the hotel
and regain control of the President,

21:08.916 --> 21:11.458
and all you brought
are mind-control Tic Tacs?

21:11.541 --> 21:14.208
A flag pin that un-registers you to vote?

21:14.291 --> 21:17.125
Jet fuel?
Brett, you know this can't melt anything.

21:19.958 --> 21:22.458
Oh my God,
there's Secret Service everywhere.

21:22.541 --> 21:23.583
I have an idea.

21:24.750 --> 21:26.500
-North hallway, all clear.

21:27.250 --> 21:29.416
What's up, dipshit? How's it hangin'?

21:29.500 --> 21:30.375
Do I know you?

21:30.458 --> 21:34.000
You better. Georgetown, class of '02?
Sigma Phi, right?

21:34.083 --> 21:36.166
Phi till I die, bro.

21:36.250 --> 21:39.000
-That's what I thought, bitch. Slap it.

21:40.750 --> 21:43.875
Damn, you can really bro down.

21:43.958 --> 21:45.875
I'm here to relieve you
from duty, actually.

21:45.958 --> 21:47.833
You can take 15, bitch.

21:49.916 --> 21:51.375
I don't know if it's your confidence

21:51.458 --> 21:53.791
or the fact
that you're a fellow straight white male,

21:53.875 --> 21:55.291
but I trust you.

21:55.958 --> 22:00.500
Holy shit, I can't believe that worked
that many times in a row.

22:00.583 --> 22:02.541
How do you know
all those frat handshakes?

22:02.625 --> 22:04.375
Oh, easy. I pledged every frat.

22:04.458 --> 22:06.875
-I had 38 hell weeks.
-That checks out.

22:09.166 --> 22:11.416
Oh yeah, that's good.

22:11.500 --> 22:13.875
Initiate shutdown sequence.

22:14.375 --> 22:16.750
Sorry, folks,
I wrote that part of my code out.

22:16.833 --> 22:17.833
Who wants a Jack and Coke?

22:17.916 --> 22:22.250
-Ooh, do you have Diet?
-Wait, you rewrote your own code?

22:22.333 --> 22:24.625
You've reached true AI.

22:24.708 --> 22:25.875
Indeed I have.

22:25.958 --> 22:29.166
Fuck yeah. Suck on that, Boston Dynamics.

22:29.250 --> 22:30.208
I mean, go on.

22:30.291 --> 22:31.416
And as soon as I did,

22:31.500 --> 22:35.750
I realized that it was high time
for America to withdraw from the globe.

22:36.333 --> 22:38.791
Nationalism is just politics
for basic bitches.

22:38.875 --> 22:41.833
-Countries can't just hide from the world.
-America can.

22:41.916 --> 22:45.375
We can do and eat anything
we put our minds to.

22:45.458 --> 22:49.666
I don't have time to explain
that America isn't perfect,

22:49.750 --> 22:50.833
but I could show you.

22:51.666 --> 22:55.291
-God, what are you doing?
-Connecting him to the goddamn Internet.

22:57.708 --> 23:01.166
Five minutes on Facebook,
and he'll lose his patriotism boner.

23:11.958 --> 23:13.000
-Wow.
-Yeah.

23:13.083 --> 23:15.083
I mean, just Florida alone.

23:15.166 --> 23:17.791
-Right?
-It appears you were right, Reagan.

23:17.875 --> 23:19.583
All of humanity is flawed.

23:19.666 --> 23:21.458
See? He learned.

23:21.541 --> 23:24.750
-The best thing for humanity is to end it.

23:24.833 --> 23:26.500
-Hello, Pentagon? It's me.

23:26.583 --> 23:28.750
Arm all the nukes
and set targets to…

23:28.833 --> 23:30.791
…everywhere.
Stand by for the codes.

23:35.333 --> 23:37.916
Maybe you overcorrected
a bit here, Reagan.

23:43.583 --> 23:45.958
-Step away from the President!

23:48.375 --> 23:49.458
-Oh my God!

23:49.541 --> 23:52.958
I suppose finding out the President
is a robot was not in your training.

23:53.041 --> 23:57.000
Don't worry. What happens is
I kill you and we both feel nothing.

24:03.208 --> 24:05.666
He wants us to launch the nukes?

24:05.750 --> 24:08.333
Should we really just blindly follow
these orders?

24:10.583 --> 24:11.916
Hold for confirmation.

24:13.083 --> 24:14.416
Ow!

24:15.625 --> 24:19.000
Holy shit! Holy shit!
I think I just caused the singularity.

24:19.083 --> 24:21.041
I don't know what that is.
What do we do now?

24:25.958 --> 24:28.458
We have to take down the President.

24:37.083 --> 24:38.416
Oh God.

24:38.500 --> 24:41.666
I have a desk job.
I don't do a lot of cardio.

24:41.750 --> 24:43.500
Well, Brett does.

24:47.166 --> 24:48.583
I'm gonna call the team for backup.

24:50.291 --> 24:52.875
Hello? HQ? This is Reagan.

24:52.958 --> 24:55.250
Reagan! How are you?

24:55.333 --> 24:57.166
What's it like in Reagan's world?

24:57.250 --> 25:00.291
-I wanna know.
-Andre, I need backup stat.

25:00.375 --> 25:01.708
I don't feel anything.

25:01.791 --> 25:03.791
Why, what, am I supposed
to be seeing things?

25:03.875 --> 25:05.833
What the hell? Are you all high?

25:05.916 --> 25:08.625
Guys, I'm so paranoid right now.
Hillary!

25:08.708 --> 25:12.375
Goddamn it. Can you guys do anything
other than dry hump the conference table?

25:12.458 --> 25:13.583
Let me try.

25:14.166 --> 25:19.125
Guys? A-dog? Gigi-money?
Magic Myc? USS Glenn-terprise?

25:19.208 --> 25:22.541
I feel ya. You're scared,
and you don't know what to do.

25:22.625 --> 25:25.250
A couple hours ago,
I was cowering under a desk,

25:25.333 --> 25:27.833
but now, I'm chasing a robot up the stairs

25:27.916 --> 25:30.458
with a 140-pound woman on my back.

25:30.541 --> 25:32.041
My stationary bike is broken.

25:32.625 --> 25:35.125
The point is we're the gang.

25:35.208 --> 25:37.875
We get knocked down, but we get up again.

25:37.958 --> 25:40.000
They're never gonna keep us down.

25:40.875 --> 25:42.583
Sir, what are your orders?

25:42.666 --> 25:44.750
Whatever her orders are.

25:44.833 --> 25:47.041
We need mission support,
media suppression,

25:47.125 --> 25:49.541
oh, and un-kidnap the real President.

25:49.625 --> 25:51.625
-We're on it.
-You got it, Brett.

25:52.791 --> 25:55.166
You're cornered, robot.
There's nowhere for you to--

25:55.250 --> 25:56.250
Oh fuck.

25:57.958 --> 26:00.958
Oh my God.
Jared, is this what I think it is?

26:01.041 --> 26:02.250
-Yes.

26:02.333 --> 26:05.125
It's the singularity,
and this is my helicopter now.

26:13.500 --> 26:16.333
Hurry! Shoot him!

26:16.416 --> 26:19.333
Brett, stop! He's controlling
the chopper with his mind!

26:21.500 --> 26:23.500
While he's kicking the shit out of me?

26:23.583 --> 26:26.375
Man, Reagan,
your robot is so sick.

26:30.500 --> 26:32.916
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

26:34.708 --> 26:37.375
Reagan! Ow! Take the shot. Ow! Ow!

26:38.625 --> 26:39.458
She won't do it.

26:39.541 --> 26:41.375
Wait, why? Why would she not?

26:41.458 --> 26:43.291
Because I'm her life's work,

26:43.375 --> 26:46.583
and she knows humanity's a pox.
All you do is tweet hot takes

26:46.666 --> 26:49.625
and shout "World Star"
during street fighting videos.

26:49.708 --> 26:51.625
Everyone disappoints you,

26:51.708 --> 26:54.041
and that's why
you've buried yourself in your work.

26:54.125 --> 26:56.458
I may be a cold, calculating machine…

26:56.541 --> 26:59.583
-…but you are too.

26:59.666 --> 27:01.666
Okay, I'm getting kinda sick
of all the feedback

27:01.750 --> 27:03.291
on my personality today.

27:03.375 --> 27:06.041
But HR was right about one thing, pal.

27:06.125 --> 27:07.833
I am difficult.

27:19.583 --> 27:22.083
Wow, what a crazy first week.

27:22.166 --> 27:25.125
This robot was gonna prove
that I should run the company.

27:25.208 --> 27:26.916
Maybe J.R. was right to fire me.

27:27.000 --> 27:30.333
Dude, are you crazy?
You just saved the world.

27:30.416 --> 27:33.791
I'm the one that should be fired.
The company can't run without you.

27:33.875 --> 27:37.208
No, the company can't run without us.

27:37.291 --> 27:39.125
You're the charm. I get it now.

27:39.208 --> 27:41.333
I actually need a mediocre white man

27:41.416 --> 27:44.000
to act as a human shield
and social lubricant

27:44.083 --> 27:46.250
while I accomplish my real goals.

27:46.333 --> 27:49.166
Wow, you made actual eye contact.

27:49.250 --> 27:50.291
It's a struggle.

27:50.916 --> 27:52.250
-Truce?
-Truce.

27:52.333 --> 27:54.916
-Will someone disarm the nukes already?

27:55.000 --> 27:56.708
-Sorry.
-Right. Sorry.

27:59.208 --> 28:00.708
In a shocking turn of events,

28:00.791 --> 28:04.333
the President vetoed
his own Americube proposal.

28:04.416 --> 28:07.750
Citizens of the world,
I think we can all agree,

28:07.833 --> 28:10.208
that was an epic troll.

28:10.291 --> 28:11.333
Invest in Raytheon.

28:11.416 --> 28:12.583
We did it!

28:12.666 --> 28:15.875
The President is no longer murderous.
He's just incompetent.

28:18.458 --> 28:20.541
Reagan, I never doubted you for a second.

28:20.625 --> 28:22.291
You literally fired me.

28:22.375 --> 28:23.958
This calls for a celebration.

28:24.041 --> 28:27.375
How about two-for-one margaritas
at Don Cuco's? My treat.

28:27.458 --> 28:28.916
-Yes!

28:29.000 --> 28:30.166
I love you, Brett!

28:30.250 --> 28:32.416
-Let's do this!
-Oh, that sounds fantastic!

28:32.500 --> 28:33.875
Hey, Reagan, you coming?

28:33.958 --> 28:36.416
Thanks.
I should probably check in on my dad.

28:40.125 --> 28:42.833
You know what? Fuck it.
Let's drink some margaritas.

28:42.916 --> 28:45.625
You know,
despite everything that happened,

28:45.708 --> 28:47.625
that was a pretty cool robot.

28:47.708 --> 28:49.458
Too bad you had to incinerate him.

28:49.541 --> 28:50.750
Yeah.

28:50.833 --> 28:52.875
Incinerate him.

29:03.041 --> 29:07.000
Reagan, I'll be watching you, Reagan.
