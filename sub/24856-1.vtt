Ah, wait. All right.</i>

<i>Let me get the earplugs!</i>

00:17.932 --> 00:20.333
<i>Where is that video
button thing?</i>

00:20.335 --> 00:21.834
<i>Oh there! I see you!</i>

00:21.836 --> 00:24.673
<i>Oh, Matthew, darling?
How is Berlin? Hm?</i>

00:27.009 --> 00:28.644
<i>What?!</i>

00:29.911 --> 00:32.548

<i>Matthew!</i>

00:35.484 --> 00:38.751
<i>Oh! Oh! Wait! Wait! Wait!
You heard her clearly?</i>

00:38.753 --> 00:41.687

03:07.269 --> 03:10.637
- I love this house.
- Yeah, ditto.

03:10.639 --> 03:12.672
It's in great shape too. Here.

03:12.674 --> 03:14.808
Oh.

03:14.810 --> 03:17.013
Jesus Christ! Mom!

03:18.913 --> 03:20.780
That's a leak.

03:20.782 --> 03:21.947
Looks minor though.

03:21.949 --> 03:23.649
Mom!

03:27.588 --> 03:28.954
- Mom!
- Agh!

03:28.956 --> 03:30.290
Why aren't you ready yet?

03:30.292 --> 03:31.892
The alarm didn't go off.

03:31.894 --> 03:33.927
Oh, fuck... it did.

03:33.929 --> 03:37.663
Cibby came over last night
and we had couple pisco sours

03:37.665 --> 03:38.999
and random daiquiri and...

03:39.001 --> 03:41.701
John, would you stop
that fucking racket!

03:41.703 --> 03:43.303
You told me to be here,
Barbara!

03:43.305 --> 03:46.273
Carry on!

03:46.275 --> 03:48.674
- How was your trip?
- Oh, wonderful!

03:48.676 --> 03:50.677
Yeah. I love Vietnam,

03:50.679 --> 03:52.211
oh, I could live in a hut

03:52.213 --> 03:54.881
and sit there and read
for the rest of my life.

03:54.883 --> 03:56.282
You're tanned.

03:56.284 --> 03:59.052
You're white,
you need get some sun.

03:59.054 --> 04:01.887
No I don't actually. My
melatonin and Vitamin D levels

04:01.889 --> 04:04.156
are exactly where
I want them to be.

04:04.158 --> 04:07.560
Is that-is that freshly
squeezed orange juice?

04:09.063 --> 04:11.064
Oh, we have to remember
to pick up my date.

04:11.066 --> 04:12.865
Wait a sec,
you're bringing a date?

04:12.867 --> 04:15.234
Since when? Who is she?

04:15.236 --> 04:19.305
He... a former colleague,
teaches ecology and math.

04:19.307 --> 04:21.341
Very, very well I might add.

04:21.343 --> 04:25.144
So, you're still renting
your room to Q, I guess?

04:25.146 --> 04:26.680
- He's the bike courier.
- Right.

04:26.682 --> 04:28.147
Indeed I am.

04:28.149 --> 04:30.149
Oh, he got hit by a car
yesterday.

04:30.151 --> 04:32.185
He got a concussion, he's okay,

04:32.187 --> 04:35.221
just a little confused,
keeps calling me Ronald.

04:35.223 --> 04:37.856
Well, I'm, I'm very sorry
to hear that but...

04:37.858 --> 04:40.594
don't you think he could give
you back your room

04:40.596 --> 04:42.861
- while you're in town?
- That sounds fair, Ronald.

04:42.863 --> 04:44.731
He's paying for it! It's his.

04:44.733 --> 04:48.267
That's what renting
the fucking thing means, dear!

04:48.269 --> 04:49.771
Oh!

04:51.038 --> 04:53.772
John, stop that fucking racket!

04:53.774 --> 04:56.242
You told me to be here,
Barbara!

05:17.865 --> 05:20.233
Oh, hey Q, how are you?

05:20.235 --> 05:22.202
Pretty good, pretty good.

05:22.204 --> 05:24.269
Well, I got hit by a car
yesterday.

05:24.271 --> 05:26.072
Oh yeah, I heard.

05:26.074 --> 05:27.877
Have you seen Ronald?

05:29.110 --> 05:32.378
No, that is... that's not
anybody.

05:32.380 --> 05:35.584
There is nobody who lives here
whose name is Ronald.

05:37.218 --> 05:39.622
Well, I gotta get to work.

05:41.122 --> 05:43.759
- Have a good day, Q.
- You too.

05:49.163 --> 05:51.096
Ugh! I hate that painting.

05:51.098 --> 05:52.998
It makes me want to barf.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.168
- Uh... I'm sorry, who are you?
- I live here.

05:56.170 --> 05:58.837
For the moment anyway,
cuz it's cheap as fuck.

05:58.839 --> 06:00.707
Yeah. I'm looking
for my brother,

06:00.709 --> 06:02.709
do you know where he is?

06:02.711 --> 06:05.745
♪ ...late night, giving a fuck ♪

06:05.747 --> 06:07.846
- Hi bro.
- Not your bro.

06:07.848 --> 06:09.281
Why aren't you ready?

06:09.283 --> 06:12.185
- Hm.
- Oh, that's gross, dude.

06:12.187 --> 06:16.022
Magda, Carrie.
Carrie is my sister.

06:16.024 --> 06:18.091
She's... excuse me...

06:18.093 --> 06:20.894
charming and beautiful
and she's a yoga instructor.

06:20.896 --> 06:23.799
Oh, she uh, she did that
painting too.

06:24.932 --> 06:27.000
Yeah, I did.

06:27.002 --> 06:30.937
I'll be right down. Yeah...
turn the washing machine on,

06:30.939 --> 06:32.105
there is lots of people
in the house.

06:32.107 --> 06:33.373
Oh, God.

06:52.259 --> 06:53.827
Hiya!

06:53.829 --> 06:56.128
This is a home invasion,
hit the ground!

06:56.130 --> 06:57.731
Take whatever you want.

06:57.733 --> 07:00.369
The only valuable thing here
is me.

07:02.303 --> 07:05.305
Ugh!

07:05.307 --> 07:06.839
I like your confidence.

07:06.841 --> 07:08.474
Oh, my back!

07:08.476 --> 07:11.243
Oh, honey.
There is my, baby?

07:13.048 --> 07:15.348
Oh, Barb!
It's so great to see you.

07:15.350 --> 07:17.950
- How was South East Asia?
- Oh, it was marvelous!

07:17.952 --> 07:21.855
I went to something called
a "full moon party".

07:21.857 --> 07:24.289
I don't remember much of it.
Let's go.

07:27.194 --> 07:28.961
How is your acting going,
Kurt?

07:28.963 --> 07:30.396
Good. Yeah.

07:30.398 --> 07:32.397
I'm in the mix for
a recurring on "CSI".

07:32.399 --> 07:35.801
What? That's amazing!
I'm so proud of you, man.

07:35.803 --> 07:37.836
- Ha.
- You're a great actor, man.

07:37.838 --> 07:40.807
When have you-when have you
ever seen me act?

07:40.809 --> 07:43.510
In the play.
About that thing.

07:43.512 --> 07:45.980
Yeah.

07:47.249 --> 07:49.348
You notice how mom says "oh"
all the time?

07:49.350 --> 07:51.250
Like, she applies it
to every emotion.

07:51.252 --> 07:53.986
Like happy: Oh!

07:53.988 --> 07:55.356
Sad: Like Ooooh!

07:56.891 --> 07:59.427
Surprised: OOOOOHHH!

08:00.961 --> 08:02.361
Has she been singing?

08:02.363 --> 08:04.998
Only in the shower?

08:05.000 --> 08:07.433
Do you think she's a little too
old to do all this traveling?

08:07.435 --> 08:09.101
I think it's cool.

08:09.103 --> 08:10.969
It's not like she's staying
in youth hostels.

08:10.971 --> 08:12.805
I'd fact check that.

08:12.807 --> 08:14.940
This is how people react
when they're in a crisis.

08:14.942 --> 08:17.343
She can't be home because that
would mean facing her reality.

08:17.345 --> 08:19.579
OOOHHH Misha!

08:19.581 --> 08:21.180
Open the back, please!

08:22.550 --> 08:24.416
...so when Daria
gets back from Russia

08:24.418 --> 08:26.885
she'll take the solarium,
I'll move to the couch.

08:26.887 --> 08:30.456
- OH!
- What the fuck was that?!

08:30.458 --> 08:33.058
- I'm okay! Totally fine!
- You okay Q?

08:33.061 --> 08:34.326
It's part of the job!

08:54.316 --> 08:56.049
Can we talk about the Eastern
European child

08:56.051 --> 08:59.252
- living in my bedroom?
- Oh, Magda, isn't she lovely?

08:59.254 --> 09:00.520
So you don't mind
that Kurt's fucking her?

09:00.522 --> 09:02.522
- Ohhhh, my!
- He is?

09:02.524 --> 09:04.223
Well, it's none of my business

09:04.225 --> 09:06.225
but if you want
an honest opinion,

09:06.227 --> 09:08.427
Screwing a 21-year-old
is symptomatic of Kurt

09:08.429 --> 09:10.296
not taking himself seriously.

09:10.298 --> 09:11.897
Then it is your business.

09:11.899 --> 09:13.333
Oh, definitely.

09:13.335 --> 09:14.968
Well, it's my childhood
bedroom, okay?

09:14.970 --> 09:16.435
And it's disgusting.

09:16.437 --> 09:18.171
But it's not your room
anymore.

09:18.173 --> 09:19.939
We packed up your Judy Blume
books

09:19.941 --> 09:21.541
and your failed math exams.

09:21.543 --> 09:25.078
Oh, you sucked in match.
That's so cute.

09:25.080 --> 09:27.146
I think Q found
your vibrators.

09:27.148 --> 09:29.147
He might be using them.

09:29.149 --> 09:31.050
The least you could do
is mail them to me.

09:31.052 --> 09:33.887
- Oh!
- Vibrators? Nice.

09:33.889 --> 09:35.557
- Very nice!
- Okay.

09:55.509 --> 09:57.413
- There we go.
- Fuck me.

09:58.613 --> 10:01.647
- Well, that's great.
- Okay.

10:01.649 --> 10:03.549
- Oh God!
- We're parked.

10:03.551 --> 10:05.017
- Everybody good...
- Yeah.

10:05.019 --> 10:06.652
- ...emotionally?
- Yep.

10:06.654 --> 10:11.424
400 and 25 fucking dollars
a night, for this place?

10:11.426 --> 10:13.993
Yo Dude. Dude.
Recognize this t-shirt?

10:13.995 --> 10:16.195
No, should I?

10:16.197 --> 10:18.164
It's Levi's.

10:18.166 --> 10:20.233
Car-Carrie's Levi,
her ex-boyfriend?

10:20.235 --> 10:22.468
Levi's the shit, man.

10:22.470 --> 10:25.003
His music is so fucking dope.

10:25.005 --> 10:27.607
You must be really excited
to meet him, then?

10:27.609 --> 10:30.410
Wore my favorite shirt,
didn't I?

10:30.412 --> 10:32.478
Hey, there's the world
traveler!

10:32.480 --> 10:35.381
Oh! Come here!

10:35.383 --> 10:38.017
- Oh!
- You okay?

10:38.019 --> 10:40.052
I just, I just love you
so much.

10:40.054 --> 10:41.421
I love you, too.

10:41.423 --> 10:42.722
You look beautiful, mom.

10:42.724 --> 10:45.257
So much love, big brother!
So much love!

10:45.259 --> 10:46.725
- Mwah!
- Wouldn't miss it.

10:46.727 --> 10:49.963
This must be Misha,
nice to... hug you!

10:49.965 --> 10:51.564
It's an honor.

10:51.566 --> 10:53.432
Okay.

10:53.434 --> 10:56.134
You feel like her brother.

10:56.136 --> 10:59.439
This stoned little chap here,
is my date, Albert.

10:59.441 --> 11:01.440
- Hi.
- And last but not least,

11:01.442 --> 11:03.041
the man who will screw
any boarder,

11:03.043 --> 11:04.978
no matter the country of origin,

11:04.980 --> 11:07.149
your brother... Kurt!

11:10.184 --> 11:13.118
Oh...

11:13.120 --> 11:15.488
"Um, siblings,
they resemble us just enough

11:15.490 --> 11:17.623
to make all their differences
confusing,

11:17.625 --> 11:19.993
and no matter what we choose
to make of this,

11:19.995 --> 11:21.761
we are cast in relation to them,

11:21.763 --> 11:25.598
our whole lives long"
Susan Scarfe Merrell.

11:25.600 --> 11:28.401
Who writes for
I don't care magazine.

11:28.403 --> 11:30.636
- That's not funny.
- You look like shit.

11:30.638 --> 11:33.406
You too.

11:33.408 --> 11:36.008
You skinny piece of shit.

11:36.010 --> 11:37.477
Mwah!

11:37.479 --> 11:40.046
Okay, let's go inside.
Let's get you warm, ma.

11:46.020 --> 11:47.420
So do you two have
separate rooms, or...?

11:47.422 --> 11:49.254
Separate beds.

11:49.256 --> 11:50.455
Pretty much
the same thing.

11:50.457 --> 11:53.291
- Is it?
- Hi.

11:56.364 --> 11:58.334
- You look amazing! Hi.
- Hi.

12:02.269 --> 12:04.302
I'm so nervous.

12:04.304 --> 12:06.539
Baby! Hi! How are you?

12:06.541 --> 12:08.340
Good. Good.

12:08.342 --> 12:10.410
- Love you. I miss you.
- Okay.

12:10.412 --> 12:14.046
Needless to say,
um, I know this is...

12:14.048 --> 12:15.748
- will you make sure mom's okay?
- I knew it was coming.

12:15.750 --> 12:17.682
Waaa, it's my wedding.

13:14.174 --> 13:16.108
Move those stems,
Albert!

13:16.110 --> 13:17.743
I'm moving them.

13:17.745 --> 13:20.713
All right, no tragedies yet.

13:20.715 --> 13:23.483
Shit.

13:23.485 --> 13:26.319
- Oh, I-I mean, hi.
- Hello.

13:26.321 --> 13:28.588
Well, I didn't expect you
here. I thought you were

13:28.590 --> 13:30.723
taking pictures
in the Middle East.

13:30.725 --> 13:32.557
There's shrapnel in my brain.

13:32.559 --> 13:35.393
- My God, can they get it out?
- No, it's permanent.

13:35.395 --> 13:37.262
- Oh my...
- Who's this man?

13:37.264 --> 13:40.269
- This man is my date.
- Albert. It's a pleasure.

13:43.471 --> 13:45.671
Well, it was nice to see you.

13:49.677 --> 13:51.243
Did you get my emails?

13:51.245 --> 13:54.313
A phone is better
for an old gal like me.

13:54.315 --> 13:55.748
Have a drink with me
before dinner.

13:55.750 --> 13:57.682
I need to get ready
for the rehearsal dinner.

13:57.684 --> 13:59.487
Carrie made us late.

14:00.922 --> 14:03.488
You know, eventually you're
gonna have to let that close.

14:03.490 --> 14:07.493
One drink. You owe me that.

14:07.495 --> 14:10.595
Fine, then I'll probably
have three.

14:14.434 --> 14:16.334
Who was that guy?

14:16.336 --> 14:19.738
Roy, he was Tamara's
assistant for years.

14:19.740 --> 14:22.440
Kind of an uncle
to the children.

14:22.442 --> 14:24.709
Intense fellow.

14:24.711 --> 14:26.481
Yeah. Fuckin' weird.

14:37.192 --> 14:38.858
<i>It's amazing.
It's really amazing</i>

14:38.860 --> 14:40.759
because it's like right near
all the like,

14:40.761 --> 14:43.429
<i>nice places on Melrose,
you know,</i>

14:43.431 --> 14:46.464
<i>so we get lots of lattes.
I love the chai lattes.</i>

14:46.466 --> 14:48.467
Shut up.

14:48.469 --> 14:50.536
Don't they shut up?

14:50.538 --> 14:52.537
<i>It's so good, you know. I like
always with like, almond milk.</i>

14:52.539 --> 14:54.507
<i>It's my new favorite thing.
It's so good.</i>

14:54.509 --> 14:57.810
Anyway how, how 'bout you,
Kurt? Are you still acting?

14:57.812 --> 15:00.313
Yeah, why wouldn't I be?

15:00.315 --> 15:03.485
I just wanted to know,
I-I haven't seen anything.

15:04.719 --> 15:07.320
- Levi!
- Oh.

15:07.322 --> 15:10.759
Wait, wait. Shouldn't we let
this happen organically?

15:13.760 --> 15:16.628
Okay.

15:17.999 --> 15:20.635
...but I appreciate it.
Thank you so much.

15:21.970 --> 15:23.603
Mom, mom!

15:23.605 --> 15:27.308
- Uh, yeah! Hi, honey.
- Good to see you.

15:28.643 --> 15:30.810
This is my boyfriend, Misha.

15:30.812 --> 15:33.782
Hey. Levi.
Nice to meet you, dude.

15:37.284 --> 15:39.254
It's okay to speak now.

15:40.788 --> 15:42.658
Uh...

15:43.890 --> 15:45.560
I-I-I wo... see...

15:47.761 --> 15:49.564
Heh, so...

15:54.936 --> 15:57.036
Let's go sit down.
We'll catch up with you later.

15:57.038 --> 15:58.871
- Okay.
- Okay.

15:58.873 --> 16:00.805
All right, right there,
next to this guy.

16:00.807 --> 16:02.407
- Right here.
- I'll get a chair

16:02.409 --> 16:03.776
I'll get you a chair. Come on.

16:03.778 --> 16:06.612
Okay.

16:06.614 --> 16:08.480
<i>I seriously can't believe
this.</i>

16:08.482 --> 16:10.382
<i>I'm trying not to freak out.</i>

16:10.384 --> 16:12.417
Well, it's not a crisis yet.
Let's just take a deep breath.

16:12.419 --> 16:15.387
Okay so, unfortunately yes,

16:15.389 --> 16:17.890
the chicken was cooked in the
same oven as the vegetables.

16:17.892 --> 16:20.059
- Fantastic.
- I'm sorry.

16:20.061 --> 16:21.826
Is it... is it really that big
of a deal?

16:21.828 --> 16:23.698
No, it's not, at all.

16:25.399 --> 16:27.833
It's just, I mean, we made
a point of requesting this

16:27.835 --> 16:30.036
six months ago and both of you
said it would be fine.

16:30.038 --> 16:31.637
- Yeah.
- You know, what this reminds me of

16:31.639 --> 16:33.672
is an Edna St. Vincent Millay
poem.

16:33.674 --> 16:36.508
She says, "Your tea is cold"-

16:36.510 --> 16:38.779
- Right now? You're gonna
recite the poem?

16:40.447 --> 16:41.814
What-what are you writing?

16:41.816 --> 16:43.815
Yeah, no I'm just making
a note of what not to do

16:43.817 --> 16:45.651
- at our wedding.
- We have a list.

16:45.653 --> 16:47.686
- Yes.
- We agree on everything.

16:47.688 --> 16:49.454
Right. Hey, when is that
wedding again?

16:49.456 --> 16:52.090
- This spring.
- Next fall.

16:52.092 --> 16:53.959
Okay, we gotta, we'll see you
guys in a second.

16:53.961 --> 16:56.061
I'm sorry again.

16:56.063 --> 16:59.531
- Did... what did you say?
- I said sp...

16:59.533 --> 17:01.334
- Next fall.
- Fall, yeah.

17:01.336 --> 17:03.736
- Fall.
- Okay, that's weird.

17:11.979 --> 17:13.612
- We
- would

17:13.614 --> 17:15.448
- like - to - extend

17:15.450 --> 17:16.949
- a
- warm

17:16.951 --> 17:18.651
- welcome
- to

17:18.653 --> 17:19.884
- all - of - you.

17:21.887 --> 17:24.489
Thank you.

17:49.983 --> 17:52.785
As one of the mothers
of the groom,

17:52.787 --> 17:56.622
I would like to take this
moment to welcome everyone.

17:56.624 --> 17:59.560
Oh, my goodness,
these cue cards say that

18:00.795 --> 18:02.827
we're at a wedding for a
hotshot corporate lawyer

18:02.829 --> 18:04.997
- from Bay Street...
- Wrong!

18:04.999 --> 18:08.033
Wrong! Yeah, darn.
That's not how I remember it.

18:10.137 --> 18:13.838
What I do remember
is Matty coming home

18:13.840 --> 18:16.909
and saying that he's going
to move to Berlin,

18:16.911 --> 18:19.114
and pursue a career in EDM.

18:20.781 --> 18:23.582
And hearing that, I said...
we said,

18:23.584 --> 18:26.518
"what the hell is EDM?"

18:26.520 --> 18:29.121
- I knew what it was.
- Of course you did.

18:29.123 --> 18:32.857
Then he made himself
a successful career

18:32.859 --> 18:36.464
because Matty is not afraid
of failure.

18:39.967 --> 18:42.500
He throws himself into things,

18:42.502 --> 18:45.036
and that's exactly what
he's doing with this woman,

18:45.038 --> 18:47.975
he's jumping in. Mazel tov!

18:51.179 --> 18:54.383
- Mazel tov!
- Cheers! Mazel tov!

Oh shit. I um, I forgot,
I'm sorry.

20:29.309 --> 20:31.309
I made it clear that I needed
to speak with you.

20:31.311 --> 20:33.612
Can't it wait? I'm in the
middle of my son's wedding...

20:33.614 --> 20:35.748
I've been waiting long enough!

20:39.886 --> 20:42.153
You're free now!
Don't you understand that?

20:42.155 --> 20:44.826
That evil woman cannot
control you anymore!

20:46.993 --> 20:48.963
- Excuse me!
- Please.

20:55.102 --> 20:57.036
I'm sorry, Matthew.

20:57.038 --> 20:58.874
I didn't mean to disturb
your meal.

21:00.674 --> 21:03.244
The chicken looks delicious.

21:06.180 --> 21:10.181
Uh, that concludes the dinner
theatre portion of our evening.

21:10.183 --> 21:12.684
- Thank you.
- It does. Thank you! Thank you.

21:12.686 --> 21:14.053
Oh, fuck this!

21:14.055 --> 21:16.055
Well look, why don't we
just go into our room,

21:16.057 --> 21:19.725
have a drink, relax and then
make a sort of game plan

21:19.727 --> 21:22.327
for what might possibly be
a sorta stressful weekend?

21:22.329 --> 21:24.363
Possibly?!

21:24.365 --> 21:26.332
Oh great. Here she comes!

21:26.334 --> 21:28.232
Care to explain what
the fuck that was about?

21:28.234 --> 21:30.768
Hi.
Nice to see you, too.

21:30.770 --> 21:32.805
Gee, it's been a while.
How are you?

21:32.807 --> 21:34.707
I'm fantastic.
My son's getting married.

21:34.709 --> 21:35.975
Oh, me too.

21:35.977 --> 21:37.875
The only problem is,
I just found out

21:37.877 --> 21:40.144
that my ex was fucking my
assistant behind my back.

21:40.146 --> 21:42.614
Not behind your back.

21:42.616 --> 21:44.218
I don't cheat like you.

21:45.249 --> 21:47.018
I think this might be
the mini-bar key.

21:47.020 --> 21:48.853
- Oh hi, by the way.
- Who the fuck is that?

21:48.855 --> 21:50.189
Oh, you've met him before,
but clearly,

21:50.191 --> 21:52.123
you weren't paying attention

21:52.125 --> 21:54.626
because he doesn't have a pixie
cut or a shaved pussy.

21:54.628 --> 21:57.830
We met at Sharon and Stew's
Oktoberfest a few years ago.

21:57.832 --> 21:59.264
Ah, yeah.

21:59.266 --> 22:01.767
You know where they had that
phenomenal pumpkin pie?

22:01.769 --> 22:04.870
Ooh. It was divine.
Oh... join the fuckin' party.

22:04.872 --> 22:07.038
- I'll tell him to go.
- Shut up, Albert.

22:07.040 --> 22:08.841
What's with the beard? What
are you, a frickin' wizard?

22:08.843 --> 22:10.275
Oh yeah, Roy's a wizard now.

22:10.277 --> 22:12.210
Cast a fuckin' spell,
make Tammy disappear.

22:12.212 --> 22:13.778
You are not my boss anymore.

22:13.780 --> 22:16.350
I won't be manipulated by you!

22:18.685 --> 22:20.321
Got it!

22:25.159 --> 22:26.995
Look, can I come in,
because I was thinking...

22:35.803 --> 22:37.302
It's a systemic problem.

22:37.304 --> 22:40.072
Oh, we need the whole Board
to agree,

22:40.074 --> 22:41.940
in order to make the new
platform effective.

22:41.942 --> 22:44.043
Yes, that's exactly
what I was telling them.

22:44.045 --> 22:46.077
- What, the other teachers?
- Yes, Sally and Darren.

22:46.079 --> 22:47.813
- Who have we got? All right.
- Yeah. Sally and Darren.

22:47.815 --> 22:50.349
- We've got Albert.
- Oh, and the...

22:50.351 --> 22:52.217
Ohhhh, no, no.

22:52.219 --> 22:54.255
Good God, no.

22:56.691 --> 22:57.992
Mr. Fun Time.

23:13.273 --> 23:16.343
Sue's so young and pretty,
isn't she?

23:17.978 --> 23:19.913
Yeah.

23:25.118 --> 23:27.221
You want her, don't you?

23:29.824 --> 23:31.355
Yeah.

23:48.108 --> 23:51.309
Hey babe,
you can if you want to.

23:51.311 --> 23:54.212
What?

23:54.214 --> 23:56.283
Be with Sue.

23:58.752 --> 24:00.954
I don't wanna hear about it,
but I don't mind.

24:05.058 --> 24:07.959
Look, I want you to be happy.

24:07.961 --> 24:11.098
I want you to be free. Hm?

24:36.957 --> 24:39.994
So, that was the infamous Roy,
huh?

24:41.828 --> 24:44.429
He's a lot more handsome
than I imagined.

24:44.431 --> 24:47.365
Bet he's got good bone
structure under that beard.

24:47.367 --> 24:49.367
He's lost his looks.

24:49.369 --> 24:51.569
That's harsh.

24:51.571 --> 24:54.842
Hi! Ahh, buddy,
I missed you so much!

24:56.076 --> 24:58.509
Yeah, say goodnight to me.
Speak!

24:58.511 --> 25:02.381
Say goodnight to mama.
Speak. Speak now. Speak.

25:02.383 --> 25:04.082
Just say fucking anything.

25:04.084 --> 25:07.251
'K, Care, I kinda have
to like, go to bed.

25:07.253 --> 25:08.586
- Okay, yeah.
- All right?

25:08.588 --> 25:10.055
- Yeah, okay.
- Okay.

25:10.057 --> 25:12.824
Bye!

25:12.826 --> 25:14.128
Oh.

25:15.829 --> 25:19.096
Now, come and fuck me
like you used to fuck Levi

25:19.098 --> 25:22.269
- when you were 19.
- That's weird.

25:24.070 --> 25:26.238
Let's figure out why.

25:26.240 --> 25:28.407
Do you think Barb had a real
relationship with him?

25:28.409 --> 25:30.107
I thought you said
they dated men.

25:30.109 --> 25:33.045
Yeah, but not after they
were together, come on!

25:33.047 --> 25:36.315
Oh, I am so livid
with both of them!

25:36.317 --> 25:38.417
You know, Ragu says that
I come from a family

25:38.419 --> 25:40.919
where both parents
put each other first,

25:40.921 --> 25:42.888
you know, and that was
the primary love.

25:42.890 --> 25:44.856
And so the children
are searching

25:44.858 --> 25:48.125
for this unconditional love
that they never got at home.

25:48.127 --> 25:50.562
Did you spell Ragu,
like the pasta sauce?

25:50.564 --> 25:53.500
Ragu says my moms claim...
claim, okay,

25:54.934 --> 25:58.237
to be this ultra-liberal,
open-minded people,

25:58.239 --> 26:00.271
when their own approach
to relationships

26:00.273 --> 26:02.306
is totally antiquated, right.

26:02.308 --> 26:05.142
That's like, grow the fuck up.

26:05.144 --> 26:08.881
Powerful love is so much more
than some meaningless screw.

26:08.883 --> 26:11.083
But you and I had an open
relationship for a while.

26:11.085 --> 26:13.451
We set out rules like adults.
We followed them.

26:13.453 --> 26:16.153
We slept with a few people.

26:16.155 --> 26:17.989
A few?

26:17.991 --> 26:20.625
I thought it was just
that skank, Ariane?

26:20.627 --> 26:23.030
Yeah, it was just that skank,
Ariane.

26:28.903 --> 26:30.471
Baby boomers.

26:31.939 --> 26:34.640
What is this world
they're giving us?

26:34.642 --> 26:36.574
They have done nothing right.

26:36.576 --> 26:38.479
Free shipping?

26:40.079 --> 26:42.514
Dancing to Motown
while doing the dishes?

26:42.516 --> 26:44.615
I'm gonna take a shower.

26:44.617 --> 26:46.218
No, no, no, you don't have
to do that.

26:46.220 --> 26:48.019
Not for me, not ever.

26:48.021 --> 26:49.857
I am not feelin' it, dude.

26:55.162 --> 26:57.028
Hey, you know, it'd be nice
if we could just show up

26:57.030 --> 26:58.663
to a hotel once in a while,

26:58.665 --> 27:01.402
and make love,
like a normal couple.

27:04.637 --> 27:07.305
Well, if you need me,

27:07.307 --> 27:10.478
I'll be masturbating
onto Levi's t-shirt.

27:12.980 --> 27:16.315
- Phew! Ridiculous!
- Oh my God!

27:18.519 --> 27:21.385
Why did you invite French
Canadian Gandolf?

27:21.387 --> 27:24.588
Well, I thought if I could
trick him back

27:24.590 --> 27:26.525
into civilization,
he might shower.

27:26.527 --> 27:29.161
- Hmm.
- No, he's not...

27:29.163 --> 27:31.395
you know, he's always been
really good to me, Roy.

27:31.397 --> 27:34.498
- Mm-hm?
- Oh, how annoying is Carrie?

27:34.500 --> 27:36.567
Oh my God, like the world
does not revolve around

27:36.569 --> 27:38.402
your dietary restrictions.

27:38.404 --> 27:40.471
And Misha, every time
he walks in a room,

27:40.473 --> 27:43.307
it's like a cloud of marijuana
smoke comes with him.

27:43.309 --> 27:45.544
Like he has his own atmosphere.

27:45.546 --> 27:47.446
Maybe Tammy got a contact
buzz,

27:47.448 --> 27:49.381
and that's why her speech
was so terrible?

27:49.383 --> 27:52.616
Well, I don't know if I'd use
the word terrible.

27:52.618 --> 27:55.420
I mean, I get why
you liked it.

27:55.422 --> 27:57.421
It was all about Matt.

27:57.423 --> 28:00.424
Her Matty. Her Matthew.

28:00.426 --> 28:02.626
Nothing about the woman

28:02.628 --> 28:05.299
he's about to spend
the rest of his life with.

28:09.336 --> 28:11.469
That is very fair, my dear.

28:11.471 --> 28:14.472
That speech could have used
a re-write.

28:14.474 --> 28:16.607
I mean, I get why she's
obsessed with you.

28:16.609 --> 28:18.410
You're the only one
in the family

28:18.412 --> 28:21.179
that's not suffering
from failed potential.

28:21.181 --> 28:23.748
It's like everyone else seems

28:23.750 --> 28:26.384
disappointed in themselves.

28:31.057 --> 28:33.658
Did you get a chance
to talk to him?

28:33.660 --> 28:35.430
Who?

28:37.798 --> 28:39.733
No, not yet.

28:42.669 --> 28:45.569
I did, I think he's doing
well. He...

28:45.571 --> 28:48.039
I don't know. He seems good.
He's up for a big part.

28:48.041 --> 28:49.176
- Cool.
- Yeah.

29:31.285 --> 29:32.584
Woo!

29:40.326 --> 29:42.460
All right, ladies! You should
feel this one all the way

29:42.462 --> 29:44.728
from your shoulders
to your booty.

29:44.730 --> 29:47.099
- Ready?
- Oh yeah.

29:47.101 --> 29:50.168
- That feels good. Woo!
- Yeah!

29:50.170 --> 29:52.140
Now, pivot!

29:53.272 --> 29:55.474
Pivot!
Need to lower your waist like,

29:55.476 --> 29:57.542
fits chicken like Brittany
over there.

29:57.544 --> 29:59.344
I'm tryin' my best!

29:59.346 --> 30:00.644
Oh yeah, Brittney is
tryin' her best.

30:00.646 --> 30:02.279
Now cue your little move here.

30:02.281 --> 30:04.748
We're gonna pulse, pulse, pulse.

30:04.750 --> 30:06.421
Hey!

30:07.721 --> 30:09.421
Hey girl!

30:09.423 --> 30:10.755
You ready to get bikini ready?

30:10.757 --> 30:12.657
Uh, yeah!

30:12.659 --> 30:14.191
All right, dive in here, girl.

30:14.193 --> 30:16.260
Get in there, make some space.

30:16.262 --> 30:18.896
That's it! Make some space
for the cutie patootie.

30:18.898 --> 30:21.499
There you go. Yeah!

30:21.501 --> 30:24.503
Look at this extraordinary
garden!

30:24.505 --> 30:28.472
The water lilies have such
amazing color in them.

30:28.474 --> 30:31.709
Albert, keep it to yourself.

30:31.711 --> 30:35.713
Yes, I suppose I am being
a rather loquacious person

30:35.715 --> 30:37.551
this morning. Have fun!

30:44.790 --> 30:48.160
So you still planning
on opening your studio?

30:48.162 --> 30:50.228
Because I can help you
with a business plan.

30:50.230 --> 30:51.796
Yeah, that's not happening
anytime soon.

30:51.798 --> 30:55.333
Why would you say that?

30:55.335 --> 30:57.936
I'm 50 grand in debt.

30:57.938 --> 31:01.206
Don't you remember making
me pay for rent and tuition

31:01.208 --> 31:02.707
when I was in university?

31:02.709 --> 31:04.776
We did it to make you
stronger.

31:04.778 --> 31:06.311
I think you just made her
pissed off.

31:06.313 --> 31:08.412
Shut up, Brittney!
Woo! Let's go.

31:08.414 --> 31:09.948
Okay. You're holding
on to something,

31:09.950 --> 31:11.516
you've got it built up
deep inside of you,

31:11.518 --> 31:13.317
just let it go. Jumping Jack!

31:13.319 --> 31:14.818
Punch! Jumping Jack!

31:14.820 --> 31:16.720
Punch! Jumping Jack!

31:16.722 --> 31:20.458
Punch! Jumping Jack!
Punch! Ahhh!

31:24.698 --> 31:26.767
Lovely. Great.

31:27.968 --> 31:30.501
Fabulous. Ha ha. Oh.

31:30.503 --> 31:32.203
- Hi.
- I'm sorry.

31:32.205 --> 31:34.241
No, it's okay, don't be.

31:35.375 --> 31:36.810
I'm Albert, and um,

31:38.679 --> 31:42.150
I guess we haven't been
properly introduced.

31:43.383 --> 31:46.218
I'm Mareva,
Mareva de la Torre.

31:46.220 --> 31:47.585
It's a wonderful garden.

31:47.587 --> 31:49.487
Don't you think?

31:49.489 --> 31:52.990
Oh, I certainly do,
particularly the uh, orchids.

31:52.992 --> 31:55.759
Have you noticed how
the Ipomoea cordatotriloba

31:55.761 --> 31:57.629
are different shapes and colors?

31:57.631 --> 31:59.497
How do you happen to uh...

31:59.499 --> 32:02.566
Oh, I um, I took some biology
at McGill.

32:02.568 --> 32:04.302
I like how botany relates
to math.

32:04.304 --> 32:05.569
You do, eh?

32:05.571 --> 32:07.706
Quantitative genetics,
dendrochronology.

32:07.708 --> 32:10.444
You know about
dendrochronology?

32:11.912 --> 32:13.777
You guys will play and
then I'll do my set afterwards.

32:13.779 --> 32:15.513
Hey, Kurt!

32:15.515 --> 32:16.981
Um, and not more than
45 minutes?

32:16.983 --> 32:18.616
We're cool with that?
Thank you.

32:18.618 --> 32:20.285
- Kurt! Hey!
- Hey!

32:20.287 --> 32:21.853
- How's it goin'?
- Good.

32:21.855 --> 32:23.555
- Good.
- Hey, buddy.

32:23.557 --> 32:28.293
Um, do you have a sec? Do you
want to um, sit? Catch up?

32:28.295 --> 32:29.497
Hmm...

32:30.564 --> 32:31.432
Heh, heh!

32:35.635 --> 32:39.336
You can take pictures of whatever
beautiful things you see.

32:39.338 --> 32:41.840
Do you understand me, Albert?

32:41.842 --> 32:44.378
I'm not sure.

32:46.480 --> 32:47.682
Oh! All right!

32:53.586 --> 32:56.587
Ah yes! A little bit...
Yes! Like that!

32:56.589 --> 32:59.324
Oh, that's so great.

32:59.326 --> 33:01.459
Yes!

33:01.461 --> 33:04.429
Albert, move yourself!
Get me another bloody Mary!

33:04.431 --> 33:08.302
- It's a fuckin' emergency.
- Oh, in that case, uh...

33:12.405 --> 33:15.375
Um, so you're auditioning
a lot or...

33:16.910 --> 33:19.576
You know, it's uh it's either
gonna happen or it's not, so.

33:19.578 --> 33:22.447
But I did uh, yeah, you know,

33:22.449 --> 33:23.815
it's a fuckin' boring story.

33:23.817 --> 33:25.517
No tell me, I wanna hear.
I wanna know.

33:25.519 --> 33:28.521
No, it's fine.
So uh, you and Louisa,

33:29.955 --> 33:31.789
got a new place in Berlin,
I hear?

33:31.791 --> 33:33.490
- We do. We do.
- Very nice.

33:33.492 --> 33:36.094
You should see it.
It's so very nice.

33:36.096 --> 33:39.596
But uh, it's also uber
expensive, and um,

33:39.598 --> 33:41.732
I don't know how we can um...

33:41.734 --> 33:45.336
Wait, how do you know?
How do you know that? Did mom?

33:45.338 --> 33:48.472
Oh no, uh, Louisa told me.

33:48.474 --> 33:50.542
Oh, okay, you talked
to Louisa.

33:50.544 --> 33:51.709
- Yeah.
- Okay, cool.

33:51.711 --> 33:53.577
Last night.

33:53.579 --> 33:55.447
Right, talked to Louisa at
the, um, yeah, of course.

33:55.449 --> 33:57.548
- Yeah, yeah.
- It's a wedding so...

33:57.550 --> 33:59.116
- You know...
- It's what you gotta do.

33:59.118 --> 34:00.684
- I know!
- Calm down.

34:00.686 --> 34:02.519
A lot of talkin'.
Lot of talkin'.

34:02.521 --> 34:04.889
- Calm down.
- Yeah.

34:04.891 --> 34:07.825
- Good talk.
- Yeah, good talk.

34:07.827 --> 34:09.561
- All right, buddy.
- Love you, buddy.

34:09.563 --> 34:11.429
- Love you, too.
- All right, bye.

34:24.911 --> 34:27.811
I'm just trying to keep
everyone straight.

34:27.813 --> 34:31.583
There's Levi,
who plays the ukulele,

34:31.585 --> 34:33.818
and then there's that
Mexican lady.

34:33.820 --> 34:36.820
Ooh, Mareva.
Mareva de la Torre.

34:36.822 --> 34:38.922
Mareva de la Torre,
that's right.

34:38.925 --> 34:41.025
She seems like such
an intelligent person.

34:41.027 --> 34:43.994
- I like her mind.
- I like her tits.

34:43.996 --> 34:46.929
Oh well, next time
we run into each other,

34:46.931 --> 34:49.032
I'll look at her chest, uh...

34:49.034 --> 34:51.402
- Hey there!
- Ah shit.

34:51.405 --> 34:53.070
When were you gonna tell me
about the boarders

34:53.072 --> 34:54.938
living in our house?

34:54.940 --> 34:57.575
It's on my calendar on none
of-your-fuckin'-business day.

34:57.577 --> 35:00.711
When you turn our house into
a B&B full of bike couriers,

35:00.713 --> 35:02.146
it becomes my business.

35:02.148 --> 35:03.882
How am I supposed to pay
the bills?

35:03.884 --> 35:06.016
I need those rental cheques,
to survive!

35:06.018 --> 35:08.552
So you can vacation
like an 18-year-old?

35:08.554 --> 35:09.787
Pretty much!

35:09.789 --> 35:11.655
She just came back
from Southeast Asia.

35:11.657 --> 35:12.923
Yeah. It was divine!

35:12.925 --> 35:14.825
Who is this person following
you around?

35:14.827 --> 35:17.829
- He's my date!
- Be careful you're at the edge!

35:17.831 --> 35:19.930
And a fabulous one, at that!

35:19.932 --> 35:22.499
This is it, this is the place
we'd always come

35:22.501 --> 35:23.867
when I was a kid,
Fairmont Bagels.

35:23.869 --> 35:25.804
Every time we came to Montreal.

35:25.806 --> 35:27.771
So we could fight in public,
like a family.

35:27.773 --> 35:30.008
- Yeah, bagel shop. Huh.
- Thank you.

35:30.010 --> 35:32.177
Yeah, it's a legendary bagel
shop, though.

35:32.179 --> 35:34.579
I told you, this is where,
well, first of all,

35:34.581 --> 35:36.748
this is where Kurt and Carrie
would like to fight about

35:36.750 --> 35:38.715
whether the whole grain bagel
is a real bagel.

35:38.717 --> 35:40.851
And, whether that New Yorker
article that I was reading you

35:40.853 --> 35:42.554
about Leonard Cohen...

35:45.659 --> 35:48.626
I'm writing a novel,
based on my life.

35:48.628 --> 35:50.695
You're in it, obviously.

35:50.697 --> 35:53.231
Oh, send it to me. It'd be
good kindling for the fire.

35:53.233 --> 35:55.733
- Hey, I want to read it.
- Oh, shut up, Albert.

35:55.735 --> 35:58.101
- I thought you'd be flattered.
- Flattered?

35:58.103 --> 35:59.938
I don't want all these people
reading about me.

35:59.940 --> 36:02.907
And writing a novel does
not absolve your behaviour.

36:02.909 --> 36:05.008
You think I have time to buy
another pair of socks?

36:05.010 --> 36:07.579
- No!
- It's all part of my process, okay?

36:07.581 --> 36:09.213
You're not even a good
writer, you're...

36:09.215 --> 36:10.949
your emails could be written
by a 5-year-old.

36:10.951 --> 36:13.717
Yes? No? Food? Question mark?

36:13.719 --> 36:16.122
Is it true you're not singing
anymore?

36:18.657 --> 36:20.492
Ugh. Who told you about
the renters?

36:20.494 --> 36:22.226
- Carrie.
- Of course.

36:22.228 --> 36:24.829
Well she didn't mean to,
it just slipped out.

36:24.831 --> 36:27.168
I'm surprised she even said
anything to me at all.

36:30.737 --> 36:33.570
- You want some water?
- No.

36:33.572 --> 36:35.005
Hey, this is full of bloody
Mary's.

36:35.007 --> 36:36.608
Then, yes!

36:36.610 --> 36:38.141
Louisa,
what's the problem?

36:38.143 --> 36:40.244
I'm trying to fit into
a wedding dress tomorrow,

36:40.246 --> 36:42.079
and for some reason,
I am across town

36:42.081 --> 36:43.748
shoving a piece of dough
into my mouth,

36:43.750 --> 36:45.682
when I should be visiting
with my family.

36:45.684 --> 36:46.918
Yeah, my cousin Darrell
is an asshole,

36:46.920 --> 36:48.753
but he also came here
from Europe.

36:48.755 --> 36:49.920
This is your brain right now,
okay?

36:49.922 --> 36:52.459
Me, bagel, Tammy. Uh, Carrie.

36:54.159 --> 36:56.693
Ooh, is Kurt mad at me?
Uh, me, bagel.

36:56.695 --> 36:58.095
Okay.

36:58.097 --> 37:00.130
You guys are so obsessed
with yourselves,

37:00.132 --> 37:02.166
and trust me, it's really not
that interesting.

37:02.168 --> 37:04.802
- I'm sorry!
- I just, I need some space.

37:04.804 --> 37:06.304
Babe...

37:06.306 --> 37:08.141
I don't wanna talk to you
for a few hours.

37:11.710 --> 37:13.613
Fuckin' lunatic.

37:21.021 --> 37:22.887
Are you okay?

37:28.327 --> 37:30.498
- Oh...
- Hmmm.

37:50.215 --> 37:52.016
It's no fun

37:52.018 --> 37:55.655
being the most hated person
at a wedding.

37:57.590 --> 37:59.356
You know, my grandfather
always used to say

37:59.358 --> 38:03.026
there's one good day a week,
one bad day,

38:03.028 --> 38:06.634
and everything is just varying
degrees in the middle.

38:08.268 --> 38:10.702
Hmm.

38:10.704 --> 38:13.707
You think the same
could go for years?

38:15.175 --> 38:17.342
No.

38:17.344 --> 38:20.047
But for the sake of your
situation, let's apply it.

38:26.318 --> 38:29.920
- Hey! Brad!
- Hey, Kurt!

38:29.922 --> 38:32.289
- Did I catch you at a good time?
- Yeah.

38:32.291 --> 38:34.858
Are you at the wedding? Yeah?
Goin' okay?

38:34.860 --> 38:38.295
Uh, you know, it's uh,
it's good.

38:38.297 --> 38:39.998
You havin' a couple of drinks?

38:40.000 --> 38:42.200
Yeah. What's up?

38:42.202 --> 38:44.838
Listen, so spoke to casting
and...

38:47.206 --> 38:50.210
unfortunately it is not going
our way.

38:51.911 --> 38:54.144
But uh you know, casting said
that they loved you,

38:54.146 --> 38:56.146
- so onwards and upwards.
- Yeah. No, it's good.

38:56.148 --> 38:58.048
Okay, bud, you have a great
time this weekend.

38:58.050 --> 38:59.416
- Okay.
- Okay.

38:59.418 --> 39:00.952
- All right, buddy.
- Okay, talk soon, bud.

39:00.954 --> 39:03.054
Yeah, you too. Bye.

40:13.460 --> 40:16.293
You wanna go for a walk?

40:16.295 --> 40:18.463
No.

40:18.465 --> 40:20.998
Sweet. Meet you outside.

40:27.974 --> 40:29.373
We should get back!

40:29.375 --> 40:31.008
No, no, no, we'll never
make it. Come on!

40:31.010 --> 40:34.077
Where're you going?

40:34.079 --> 40:36.012
- You own a hair clip?
- What?

40:36.014 --> 40:37.447
- A hair clip?
- Why?

40:37.449 --> 40:39.816
Just give it to me.

40:39.818 --> 40:42.253
I had to do this once for
a shitty movie of the week.

40:42.255 --> 40:45.322
I played a nice neighbour,
who turned out to be a psycho.

40:45.324 --> 40:47.057
Yeah, it was well-cast.

40:47.059 --> 40:49.360
All right, come on!

40:49.362 --> 40:50.931
Come on!

41:01.507 --> 41:03.441
Looks like we missed
the party.

41:03.443 --> 41:04.845
Yeah.

41:18.358 --> 41:20.461
Well, Kurt...

41:22.228 --> 41:24.061
Mmm.

41:24.063 --> 41:26.363
This is disgusting.

41:26.365 --> 41:28.768
You gotta little...

41:35.809 --> 41:39.043
Sorry.

41:53.458 --> 41:55.128
I love you.

41:57.362 --> 42:00.831
- And I miss you.
- I miss you too.

42:00.833 --> 42:02.499
You look so cute.

42:02.501 --> 42:04.971
I know I do.

42:07.172 --> 42:09.809
All right.

42:13.045 --> 42:15.148
- Love you.
- Love you, too.

42:16.382 --> 42:18.583
Mwah.

42:18.585 --> 42:20.483
I miss you.

42:20.485 --> 42:22.854
I'll see ya soon.

42:22.856 --> 42:25.121
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Okay. - Bye.

42:25.123 --> 42:26.289
- All right, you got your passport?
- Check.

42:26.291 --> 42:27.858
- Phone?
- Check.

42:27.860 --> 42:29.226
Nightlight?

42:29.228 --> 42:31.128
That's really funny, ma,
some gold material.

42:31.130 --> 42:33.097
Travel books?

42:33.099 --> 42:34.865
You know I do, I don't get
why that's funny.

42:34.867 --> 42:37.001
Like, what is wrong with having
travel books? For real?

42:37.003 --> 42:38.603
- They're full of...
- Hey, Matty! Matty Matty!

42:38.605 --> 42:41.371
- Come here!
- Oh, I love you.

42:41.373 --> 42:43.074
Me too. Have fun.

42:43.076 --> 42:44.474
Thank you. And really,
thank you.

42:44.476 --> 42:46.376
For what?

42:46.378 --> 42:49.482
For never giving two shits
about anything. It inspires me.

42:51.416 --> 42:54.619
Oh, hey, Matty...
don't forget to call Louisa.

42:54.621 --> 42:56.323
- I won't. Bye.
- Bye!

42:58.056 --> 43:00.023
Thank you, everybody!

43:02.561 --> 43:05.362
...somebody locked it.
Who the fuck locked it?

43:13.940 --> 43:17.307
Okay. Not the most normal
Saturday afternoon activity,

43:17.309 --> 43:19.677
but you know, dancing
is actually really good

43:19.679 --> 43:22.445
for your serotonin levels.
I tell it to all my patients.

43:22.447 --> 43:24.315
You can't really feel suicidal

43:24.317 --> 43:27.517
when you're doing the running
man.

43:27.519 --> 43:30.320
- Well, I have a new therapist.
- Oh.

43:30.322 --> 43:32.525
- Hilda.
- And how is Hilda?

43:34.293 --> 43:37.994
- She's a great kisser.
- Ugh. Kurt.

43:37.996 --> 43:39.597
Although, I do have a problem
and I'm running into it.

43:39.599 --> 43:41.097
- Maybe you can help me?
- Hmm.

43:41.099 --> 43:43.266
If we're talking for a half
an hour

43:43.268 --> 43:44.702
and then fucking for a half
an hour,

43:44.704 --> 43:46.704
should I be paying her
for that whole hour?

43:46.706 --> 43:49.072
Your problem sounds
like a real conundrum.

43:49.074 --> 43:50.441
Right?

43:50.443 --> 43:52.275
You should do what I tell
my patients to do,

43:52.277 --> 43:55.412
which is, keep at it.
You'll find a solution.

43:55.414 --> 43:59.018
- Okay, keep at it.
- Yeah.

44:04.990 --> 44:07.358
I'm sorry I didn't call.

44:07.360 --> 44:09.327
It was cowardly.

44:09.329 --> 44:11.265
Yes, it was.

44:12.965 --> 44:15.168
I realized that after
the fact.

44:20.306 --> 44:22.275
Are you sorry?

44:23.742 --> 44:26.145
Yeah. Yes, I'm sorry.

44:28.681 --> 44:31.351
How you doin' with uh,
all this?

44:34.753 --> 44:36.289
Good.

44:38.423 --> 44:40.423
Really?

44:40.425 --> 44:42.760
Yeah.

44:47.367 --> 44:50.700
Okay. Good.

45:11.690 --> 45:13.423
What are you still doing here?

45:13.425 --> 45:16.293
Thought I'd clear my pores.

45:16.295 --> 45:19.030
Plus, there is no cancellation
policy on the room, so.

45:19.032 --> 45:21.134
Well, enjoy.

45:25.771 --> 45:27.673
Okay.

45:35.447 --> 45:37.113
Can I have a hit?

45:52.632 --> 45:54.467
Sorry about last night.

45:57.536 --> 45:59.603
Perhaps my timing
wasn't impeccable.

45:59.605 --> 46:01.141
Ha.

46:02.608 --> 46:04.275
When were you with her?

46:04.277 --> 46:07.144
They were broken up.
Don't worry.

46:07.146 --> 46:09.479
You had moved out with Misha,
'twas just me, Barb,

46:09.481 --> 46:11.782
and Q, the bike courier.

46:11.784 --> 46:13.751
How is he, by the way?

46:13.753 --> 46:16.253
Last time I saw him
he had two broken wrists.

46:16.255 --> 46:18.191
- Part of the job.
- Hmm.

46:20.693 --> 46:22.459
Your mother is a very
passionate woman.

46:22.461 --> 46:24.195
Oh no. Just stop talking,
please.

46:24.197 --> 46:26.597
- We stayed in bed for days.
- No, please, stop it.

46:26.599 --> 46:28.501
We were really there
for each other.

46:43.748 --> 46:46.516
Oh, fuck.

46:46.518 --> 46:48.621
You know there's other people
here, right?

46:55.827 --> 46:58.628
So, where you living now?

46:58.630 --> 47:00.396
Uh, I'm on a farm.

47:00.398 --> 47:02.298
45 minutes north of Toronto,

47:02.300 --> 47:03.867
but we're looking to move
to Georgian Bay.

47:03.869 --> 47:07.339
- Wow. So the middle of nowhere.
- Hmm, exactly.

47:08.641 --> 47:11.641
I'm um, I'm a farmer.
I make jam, I read,

47:11.643 --> 47:15.278
I have 5 different varieties
of chard

47:15.280 --> 47:17.416
- and I uh, have mulch.
- Mulch?

47:18.851 --> 47:21.651
I don't know what that is.
Can you translate?

47:21.653 --> 47:25.255
Oh, it's uh, paillis,
I think it is.

47:25.257 --> 47:28.391
Still don't know
what that is.

47:28.393 --> 47:30.927
Actually I've never heard
that word in either language.

47:30.929 --> 47:33.496
Yeah, well, it's a little bit
different

47:33.498 --> 47:35.666
than the last time you saw me.

47:35.668 --> 47:37.737
But just as fascinating.

47:47.313 --> 47:49.947
- Are you still writing?
- No.

47:49.949 --> 47:52.816
Why? You were good.

47:52.818 --> 47:54.717
I loved reading your stuff.

47:54.719 --> 47:56.388
Thanks.

48:00.293 --> 48:02.496
I miss you and the boys.

48:03.896 --> 48:08.264
I miss living vicariously
through your exciting lives.

48:08.266 --> 48:11.334
What?

48:11.336 --> 48:12.869
It's just been a while

48:12.871 --> 48:15.442
since I thought of my life
as exciting.

48:19.478 --> 48:21.313
It's good to see you.

48:37.230 --> 48:39.396
All right, who's next?

48:39.398 --> 48:42.967
Whose fucking story
are we gonna do now?

48:42.969 --> 48:45.635
And grammar, guys, not a rule.

48:45.637 --> 48:49.405
Discipline,
that's the only rule.

48:49.407 --> 48:51.541
Look, don't judge
that character, Ester,

48:51.543 --> 48:54.010
that's something that you do.
Inhabit her.

48:54.012 --> 48:56.246
If you're characters are
judging themselves that's fine,

48:56.248 --> 48:58.682
but you judging your characters
I mean, that's murder,

48:58.684 --> 49:01.385
that's crime on your page.

49:03.556 --> 49:05.521
- Whaddya want?
- Divorce...

49:05.523 --> 49:06.789
Wait, wait, wait.

49:06.791 --> 49:10.526
- There's more...
- Slow down.

49:10.528 --> 49:12.429
This, this is what she does

49:12.431 --> 49:14.298
when she goes on these
fashion shoots.

49:14.300 --> 49:16.300
Fucks the talent.

49:16.302 --> 49:18.836
And I'm... I'm googling one
right now, okay.

49:18.838 --> 49:22.576
She's... she looks what, half...
Korean, half Irish,

49:24.476 --> 49:26.478
half... bitch? She's... she's...

49:28.547 --> 49:30.680
she's Caligula, you know.

49:30.682 --> 49:34.418
And then-and then, she keeps,
she keeps writing to them,

49:34.420 --> 49:36.289
I mean, come on, that's...

49:37.657 --> 49:39.822
that's the worst part.

49:49.434 --> 49:51.635
My friend Cibby
is coming over around 9

49:51.637 --> 49:53.670
for pisco sours.
You know Cibby?

49:53.672 --> 49:56.673
- Only for 20 years.
- Billing, please.

49:56.675 --> 49:59.008
Billing. Yeah, I need you
to help me print out

49:59.010 --> 50:01.545
- my train ticket to Detroit.
- Why are you going to Detroit?

50:01.547 --> 50:03.380
To see my friend Fran.
But the printer's broken,

50:03.382 --> 50:05.849
and the computer guy is
in Kingston for the week.

50:05.851 --> 50:08.952
I mean, who the hell goes
to Kingston for a week?

50:08.954 --> 50:11.588
What the hell do you do,
in Kingston for a week?!

50:11.590 --> 50:13.956
I said, billing!

50:13.958 --> 50:15.793
You don't have to print your
train tickets anymore.

50:15.795 --> 50:18.561
Oh, it's Sook. Sook? Hi.

50:18.563 --> 50:21.798
Uh, fine, well,
as fine as anyone can be,

50:21.800 --> 50:24.101
whose been living a lie
for the last 25 years.

50:24.103 --> 50:28.706
Yes, and you? You what?
That, that's lovely.

50:28.708 --> 50:30.606
Uh, I have to call you back,
Sook, I'm...

50:30.608 --> 50:32.075
I'm on the other line.

50:32.077 --> 50:33.913
Hello? Operator.

50:35.380 --> 50:39.717
Operator. You get me
the fucking operator,

50:39.719 --> 50:42.885
or I am gonna come right down
there and slap you across...

50:42.887 --> 50:44.887
oh, hello.

50:44.889 --> 50:47.023
You're one of 6
students in the Master's program.

50:47.025 --> 50:49.126
I know, I just, I really feel
like I need to be here

50:49.128 --> 50:53.731
- for my mother right now.
- I get that. Uh... huh...

50:53.733 --> 50:58.001
Look class participation and
workshops are mandatory though.

50:58.003 --> 51:00.737
I'm sorry, but you're probably
gonna have to withdraw.

51:02.974 --> 51:06.744
<i>Printer's still not
working!</i>

51:48.920 --> 51:50.854
EEE! YA!

52:09.108 --> 52:10.641
Hello?

52:10.643 --> 52:13.476
- Tamara? This is Albert.
- Who?

52:13.478 --> 52:15.646
- Barbara's date.
- Oh, Alan.

52:15.648 --> 52:17.947
- No, Albert.
- I don't think we've met.

52:17.949 --> 52:21.651
- We did meet. We did.
- That's news to me.

52:21.653 --> 52:25.391
Ah, well, there is a problem
in the ceremony room,

52:26.992 --> 52:30.661
and I think it requires
your immediate attention.

52:30.663 --> 52:33.463
Oh my God! Okay!

52:39.905 --> 52:42.642
- What the hell happened here?
- What the hell happened?

52:46.545 --> 52:48.882
- Did you set this up?
- Not me.

52:56.755 --> 52:59.021
Let's go for a walk.

52:59.023 --> 53:01.460
I'm not cleanin' this shit up.

53:31.222 --> 53:33.757
So, you still drink
wine in the tub?

53:33.759 --> 53:35.157
Every night.

53:35.159 --> 53:37.226
It's the only thing that
could get you to bathe.

53:37.228 --> 53:39.295
True.

54:03.722 --> 54:05.889
- Oh shit.
- I heard you.

54:05.891 --> 54:08.061
Shit!

54:12.797 --> 54:14.666
I've decided to leave.

54:15.833 --> 54:17.633
I think it's better
for everyone.

54:17.635 --> 54:20.170
Oh, uh, well...

54:20.172 --> 54:23.941
I hope they get the shrapnel
out of your brain.

54:23.943 --> 54:26.211
Why do you act like
it didn't mean anything?

54:28.581 --> 54:31.784
It did. Then.

54:43.862 --> 54:45.128
Fuck.

54:45.130 --> 54:47.000
Wow. Oh...

54:48.233 --> 54:50.570
Lovely composition.

54:51.971 --> 54:54.106
Lovely composition, indeed!

54:55.340 --> 54:58.909
Oh my God!

54:58.911 --> 55:01.278
Hey, can you hold that?

55:01.280 --> 55:03.316
Oh! Now that's magic!

55:09.855 --> 55:12.188
- Berlin is a beautiful city.
- Yes.

55:12.190 --> 55:14.660
- World class.
- Yeah, it is.

55:21.634 --> 55:24.767
It is hard for you to do
your psychology stuff,

55:24.769 --> 55:26.838
when Matty's writing music?

55:28.239 --> 55:32.008
- Uh, well he has headphones.
- Huh.

55:32.010 --> 55:34.043
More importantly,
I-I have an office.

55:34.045 --> 55:36.214
Oh, that's neat.

55:39.418 --> 55:42.019
You know, Tammy, I'd really
like to be friends with you.

55:42.021 --> 55:45.255
- Hmm.
- I really, really admire you.

55:45.257 --> 55:48.758
- You do.
- Yeah. Your career.

55:48.760 --> 55:50.059
Your photography.

55:53.731 --> 55:56.235
Do you have a problem with me?

55:57.436 --> 56:00.302
I see myself in you.

56:00.304 --> 56:02.240
That's the problem.

56:03.675 --> 56:06.278
You're a bit of a mystery.

56:24.096 --> 56:26.264
Oh, hello there.

56:27.800 --> 56:29.700
Good agua.

56:29.702 --> 56:33.903
Yes, I've been enjoying the
cucumber flavor. Delicious!

56:33.905 --> 56:36.106
- I think about water a lot.
- Really?

56:36.108 --> 56:38.778
- All the time actually.
- You do, eh?

56:41.447 --> 56:43.280
Yeah.

56:43.282 --> 56:45.414
- Water is everywhere.
- Yes.

56:45.416 --> 56:47.883
Water is everything.

56:47.885 --> 56:50.320
And, it's permanent.

56:50.322 --> 56:53.289
- It evaporates, though.
- It becomes dry sometimes.

56:53.291 --> 56:56.293
Bet then what happens? It
evaporates into something,

56:56.295 --> 56:59.229
- is that was rain is?
- Yeah.

56:59.231 --> 57:01.264
- I think it turns into...
- Rain.

57:01.266 --> 57:03.836
...clouds and then it rains.

57:25.324 --> 57:28.891
Oh. My... God...

57:32.297 --> 57:34.530
My God.

58:16.909 --> 58:18.443
Oh... you!

58:21.246 --> 58:22.782
Mwah!

58:24.583 --> 58:26.550
I hate to keep bugging you
about this,

58:26.552 --> 58:29.019
but I wanna get everybody
straight.

58:29.021 --> 58:30.456
- There's Levi...
- Yeah.

58:32.190 --> 58:34.990
- there's that Mexican lady.
- Mareva.

58:34.992 --> 58:37.462
She seems like a...
lovely person.

58:39.597 --> 58:42.898
I bet we can expect some
stories from her this weekend.

58:42.900 --> 58:44.300
Whaddya mean?

58:44.302 --> 58:47.070
Well...

58:47.072 --> 58:50.307
legend has it, that when
she was at McGill,

58:50.309 --> 58:52.374
she went through half
the faculty.

58:52.376 --> 58:54.880
The older men.

58:56.248 --> 58:58.851
That's what she likes to sit on.

59:52.436 --> 59:53.970
Ooh, fuck off! Hey!

59:53.972 --> 59:56.238
Get the fuck off!

01:00:32.043 --> 01:00:34.311
Whiskey.

01:01:14.018 --> 01:01:15.954
Do you miss your mulch?

01:01:27.298 --> 01:01:29.168
Get off.

01:02:06.237 --> 01:02:07.670
<i>I know you must
think I'm like,</i>

01:02:07.672 --> 01:02:11.106
<i>the most terrible person
in the world right now.</i>

01:02:11.108 --> 01:02:13.612
<i>Which is fair. I guess I am.</i>

01:02:15.179 --> 01:02:18.180
We just started hanging
out and it's...

01:02:18.182 --> 01:02:21.083
it's a fucking cliché,
but it really just happened.

01:02:21.085 --> 01:02:23.052
<i>But you know, you chose
to move back to Toronto</i>

01:02:23.054 --> 01:02:25.487
<i>to pursue your acting career.</i>

01:02:25.489 --> 01:02:28.057
<i>Oh, this is so messed up.</i>

01:02:28.059 --> 01:02:31.427
<i>But you gotta know, Kurt,
how much she cares about you.</i>

01:02:31.429 --> 01:02:34.264
<i>And then so much time
passed.</i>

01:02:34.266 --> 01:02:37.068
<i>That's not an excuse, I know.</i>

01:02:38.335 --> 01:02:40.637
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

01:02:52.818 --> 01:02:54.249
Don't take too many
potatoes

01:02:54.251 --> 01:02:56.552
'cuz I want you to fit
in your clothes.

01:02:56.554 --> 01:02:58.320
Okay, don't micro-manage me.

01:02:58.322 --> 01:03:00.291
Hey! Over here, big boy!

01:03:01.525 --> 01:03:04.327
Hmm.

01:03:04.329 --> 01:03:06.198
Whoa, I feel like shit!

01:03:08.733 --> 01:03:10.669
You look like shit!

01:03:13.204 --> 01:03:16.171
Hey, by the way,
I'm over the whole

01:03:16.173 --> 01:03:19.208
- chicken in the oven fiasco.
- Oh, thank God.

01:03:19.210 --> 01:03:21.711
Hello, everybody.

01:03:21.713 --> 01:03:25.514
As you all may know, Barbara
is an incredible singer.

01:03:25.516 --> 01:03:28.485
- Oh, fuck me.
- Yeah!

01:03:28.487 --> 01:03:32.287
So I thought it would be fun
if my multi-talented,

01:03:32.289 --> 01:03:35.791
and powerful future
daughter-in-law, Louisa,

01:03:35.793 --> 01:03:38.394
would accompany her on the piano

01:03:38.396 --> 01:03:40.563
while she sings something
for us.

01:03:45.137 --> 01:03:47.436
Serenade me, Ronald!

01:03:47.438 --> 01:03:49.204
We should do something
off the cuff like this

01:03:49.206 --> 01:03:50.706
at our wedding.

01:03:50.708 --> 01:03:54.244

Hey, I love you, okay?

01:05:47.791 --> 01:05:50.793
I am so in love with you.
I want to be with you, okay.

01:05:50.795 --> 01:05:52.695
You and I, we should just get
on a fuckin' motorcycle,

01:05:52.697 --> 01:05:53.963
and just...

01:05:53.965 --> 01:05:55.530
- Oh!
- Help! Help!

01:05:55.532 --> 01:05:57.569
- Whoa.
- Help! Help!

01:05:58.869 --> 01:06:01.503
I got him! I got him
It's okay!

01:06:01.505 --> 01:06:04.442
Matty! Matty, it's okay.

01:06:05.777 --> 01:06:07.309
He's fine.
He didn't mean anything.

01:06:07.311 --> 01:06:08.846
Get him out of here.

01:06:09.981 --> 01:06:11.713
- Hey.
- We make a good team.

01:06:11.715 --> 01:06:14.751
- I think we should be a team.
- At what?

01:06:14.753 --> 01:06:17.289
I play the uke.
I'm pretty average.

01:06:18.657 --> 01:06:19.956
- It's okay, it's okay.
- You okay?

01:06:19.958 --> 01:06:21.490
I love you, Matty!

01:06:21.492 --> 01:06:23.392
It's okay, it's okay,
it's okay, it's okay...

01:06:23.394 --> 01:06:24.994
It's okay, everything's gonna
be fine. Just give me one...

01:06:24.996 --> 01:06:27.030
- No!
- Matty!

01:06:27.032 --> 01:06:29.365
It's okay.
I'm so scared. Please.

01:06:29.367 --> 01:06:31.367
Glad that's over.

01:06:31.369 --> 01:06:33.302
Whoa! No, no, wait! Wait!

01:06:33.304 --> 01:06:35.505
I'm black belt in karate.
Well, a brown belt,

01:06:35.507 --> 01:06:38.541
but I got too busy with shit.
But I will take you down.

01:06:38.543 --> 01:06:40.008
- What the fuck?
- Don't make me do that!

01:06:40.010 --> 01:06:42.345
- No, no, Matty!
- Thatta boy, Matty!

01:06:42.347 --> 01:06:43.880
I'm gonna kick your
fucking ass.

01:06:43.882 --> 01:06:45.581
Oh please come!

01:06:45.583 --> 01:06:46.983
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:06:46.985 --> 01:06:48.851
Hey, come on, let him in.

01:06:55.860 --> 01:06:57.559
What does that bandana mean?

01:06:57.561 --> 01:06:59.429
It's just to wipe.

01:06:59.431 --> 01:07:01.831
Oh, it's not code for
anything?

01:07:01.833 --> 01:07:03.902
You want it?

01:07:05.469 --> 01:07:06.738
You can have it.

01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:11.708
Your sweat smells like
pelonia flowers.

01:07:27.025 --> 01:07:28.724
By the way,

01:07:28.726 --> 01:07:31.860
you're a terrible fucking
rapper.

01:07:33.630 --> 01:07:34.896
<i>Excuse me.</i>

01:07:34.898 --> 01:07:37.367
<i>Yeah, somebody left a pile
of shit in the elevator.</i>

01:07:37.369 --> 01:07:39.668
<i>What?</i>

01:08:16.408 --> 01:08:18.477
That was nuts.

01:08:21.979 --> 01:08:23.946
Barb's voice is so amazing.

01:08:23.948 --> 01:08:25.984
So sweet of her.

01:08:33.725 --> 01:08:35.590
I don't think I'm gonna be
able to get

01:08:35.591 --> 01:08:37.058
that look you gave him
out of my head.

01:08:39.063 --> 01:08:40.997
What look?

01:08:45.470 --> 01:08:47.870
- Get out.
- Matt...

01:08:47.872 --> 01:08:49.841
Please get out,
please get out.

01:09:30.648 --> 01:09:31.781
Agh!

01:09:43.060 --> 01:09:44.828
Oh, how you gettin' home?

01:09:45.997 --> 01:09:47.830
Bus.

01:09:47.832 --> 01:09:50.469
That sounds suitably
depressing.

01:09:54.972 --> 01:09:57.607
You're gonna be all right.

01:10:32.777 --> 01:10:35.277
Albert, I need your
help.

01:10:35.279 --> 01:10:37.615
- Okay.
- Can you uh, here.

01:10:38.917 --> 01:10:41.687
- Oh my...
- I have to say something,

01:10:43.020 --> 01:10:46.955
you have been the most
exquisite date.

01:10:46.957 --> 01:10:50.192
Well, I have enjoyed every
single minute of it.

01:10:56.333 --> 01:10:58.267
Is Barbara here?
I need to speak with her.

01:10:58.269 --> 01:10:59.902
It seems to be Tammy.

01:10:59.904 --> 01:11:02.705
Yeah, I-I can hear her,
I'm 3 feet away.

01:11:02.707 --> 01:11:05.107
- I'll see you guys.
- Thank you.

01:11:05.109 --> 01:11:07.843
<i>If you need me, I'll be
at the cucumber water jug.</i>

01:11:07.845 --> 01:11:09.111
Oh, you look beautiful.

01:11:09.113 --> 01:11:11.981
Ha! Have you looked
in the mirror lately?

01:11:14.685 --> 01:11:16.718
Matthew is gone.

01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:18.987
He and Louisa got into
an argument and he left.

01:11:18.989 --> 01:11:22.023
Where'd he go?

01:11:22.025 --> 01:11:24.059
Fuck!

01:11:37.274 --> 01:11:39.642
Are you enjoying
the cucumbers?

01:11:39.644 --> 01:11:42.143
Well, they add a subtle
flavor.

01:11:42.145 --> 01:11:44.613
Hmm.

01:11:44.615 --> 01:11:47.051
Yes, they do.

01:11:56.994 --> 01:12:00.228
- Whose are those?
- Whose indeed?

01:12:00.230 --> 01:12:01.964
Did you steal those from me?

01:12:01.966 --> 01:12:04.032
If you want to imagine it
that way.

01:12:04.034 --> 01:12:07.738
Let me see those.

01:12:09.740 --> 01:12:11.906
These are not mine.

01:12:11.908 --> 01:12:14.677
Wink, wink.

01:12:14.679 --> 01:12:17.615
Honestly. These are not mine.

01:12:40.805 --> 01:12:42.307
- Okay.
- Fuck!

01:12:45.009 --> 01:12:47.175
Um, dozen raisin, please.

01:12:47.177 --> 01:12:49.747
- Get the cream cheese.
- And cream cheese.

01:12:52.350 --> 01:12:53.986
So what's the plan?

01:12:55.185 --> 01:12:57.719
Move back to Toronto.
Unless of course,

01:12:57.721 --> 01:13:00.321
there's a Swedish exchange
student sleeping in my room?

01:13:00.323 --> 01:13:02.258
She's Bulgarian.

01:13:02.260 --> 01:13:04.460
What are you gonna do with
your new apartment in Berlin?

01:13:04.462 --> 01:13:07.062
It's Louisa's apartment.
She's been carrying

01:13:07.064 --> 01:13:09.031
the bulk of our load
for a long time, now.

01:13:09.033 --> 01:13:11.200
I thought you were making
money on your music thing?

01:13:11.202 --> 01:13:13.468
Cuz it sounded better
that way.

01:13:13.470 --> 01:13:16.237
Look, what-what are you here
to tell me?

01:13:16.239 --> 01:13:18.240
She's the love of my life?
Everybody makes mistakes?

01:13:18.242 --> 01:13:21.043
You dropped a grand on the
chuppah you can't get back?

01:13:21.045 --> 01:13:22.911
- Two, actually.
- What?

01:13:22.913 --> 01:13:24.813
- Mm-hmm.
- Well spent.

01:13:24.815 --> 01:13:27.786
Look, we're here to tell you
that it's okay.

01:13:29.287 --> 01:13:32.821
Yeah. It's better it happens
now than when you're 42,

01:13:32.823 --> 01:13:34.893
with 2 kids.

01:13:38.029 --> 01:13:39.995
You know, with all due
respect, Mom,

01:13:39.997 --> 01:13:41.930
you don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

01:13:41.932 --> 01:13:44.433
She is the best thing
that has ever happened to me.

01:13:44.435 --> 01:13:46.501
And I would definitely
not be living the life

01:13:46.503 --> 01:13:49.271
that I'm living right now
as a fucking DJ in Berlin...

01:13:49.273 --> 01:13:52.711
if she didn't have my back.

01:13:54.045 --> 01:13:55.811
I don't know, if I only get
'til I'm 42,

01:13:55.813 --> 01:13:57.178
that means I get 7 more years,

01:13:57.180 --> 01:13:59.882
and I-I want those 7 years.

01:13:59.884 --> 01:14:01.920
This is not going the way we
thought it would.

01:14:04.287 --> 01:14:06.287
Look at us.

01:14:06.289 --> 01:14:09.357
Can you picture you and her
like this in 30 years?

01:14:09.359 --> 01:14:11.160
With cream cheese
all over my face?

01:14:11.162 --> 01:14:14.295
Together! Trying to talk
sense into our broke kid.

01:14:14.297 --> 01:14:16.233
In a bagel shop!

01:14:36.052 --> 01:14:37.988
Whoa, sorry, sorry.

01:14:39.323 --> 01:14:41.190
Hold that!

01:15:20.864 --> 01:15:22.768
I wanna say something.

01:15:24.368 --> 01:15:26.404
What is it?

01:15:31.375 --> 01:15:33.174
I miss you, too.

01:15:40.417 --> 01:15:42.119
Hey.

01:16:06.077 --> 01:16:09.945
You know, Levi's new album
come out?

01:16:09.947 --> 01:16:12.250
Maybe we should Zen out to it.

01:16:13.917 --> 01:16:18.053
Just see how much better you
are than him, than everyone.

01:16:18.055 --> 01:16:20.155
I guess I never really
thought about it.

01:16:20.157 --> 01:16:22.491
Exactly.

01:16:32.435 --> 01:16:35.036
Well, hey there.

01:16:35.038 --> 01:16:37.205
I just wanted to let you know
that I'm not gonna need

01:16:37.207 --> 01:16:40.174
- your help with a business plan.
- Okay.

01:16:40.176 --> 01:16:42.213
Cuz I'm going back to school.

01:16:45.682 --> 01:16:48.349
Need me to pay your tuition
and rent?

01:16:48.351 --> 01:16:51.986
Shut up, Mom.

01:16:51.988 --> 01:16:54.490
But yeah, that would be great.

01:16:57.060 --> 01:16:58.494
Mwah! I'm sorry,
I don't wanna ruin your hair.

01:16:58.496 --> 01:17:00.465
- I love you. Bye.
- Okay.

01:17:04.702 --> 01:17:06.936
Sweetie...

01:17:06.938 --> 01:17:08.536
I have an idea.
I have an idea!

01:17:14.578 --> 01:17:17.713
- Where are we going here?
- I wanna do something.

01:17:17.715 --> 01:17:19.714
Just trust me.

01:17:19.716 --> 01:17:23.218
- What?
- I want us to do our vows now,

01:17:23.220 --> 01:17:26.120
without all those people
watching us.

01:17:26.122 --> 01:17:28.991
- I was just gonna wing it.
- Yeah, so then wing it now.

01:17:28.993 --> 01:17:31.593
Okay, okay. Okay.
Fair, I'll start.

01:17:40.671 --> 01:17:45.139
- You'll have to excuse me.
- We're not sitting together?

01:18:05.029 --> 01:18:06.562
You're still here?

01:18:06.564 --> 01:18:08.496
Don't you have to get the
shrapnel out of your brain

01:18:08.498 --> 01:18:10.199
or something?

01:18:10.201 --> 01:18:13.102
- It's permanent.
- Ah...

01:18:13.104 --> 01:18:15.269
I just want you to know,
I'm looking forward

01:18:15.271 --> 01:18:17.375
to the next family function,
Bon marriage.

01:18:23.146 --> 01:18:25.216
Louisa Simon...

01:18:26.649 --> 01:18:29.250
Ever since that first moment
that I saw you,

01:18:29.252 --> 01:18:32.254
on that bench, in Berlin,

01:18:32.256 --> 01:18:35.624
I knew that I was lookin'
at my dream girl.

01:18:35.626 --> 01:18:39.596
And I felt like you saw
the man that I wanted to be,

01:18:41.097 --> 01:18:44.234
and I vow to try to be that man
every day.

01:18:47.270 --> 01:18:49.206
Okay, Matthew Berkman.

01:18:51.108 --> 01:18:54.112
I vow to listen
to you regurgitate

01:18:56.313 --> 01:18:59.348
all of the New Yorker articles
and podcasts

01:18:59.350 --> 01:19:02.454
- that you listen to.
- Yay!

01:19:04.421 --> 01:19:08.359
I promise to moisturize
your hands when you get old.

01:19:10.828 --> 01:19:12.428
I promise to always send the

01:19:12.430 --> 01:19:15.367
man from the past,
to tuck you in at night.

01:19:16.833 --> 01:19:20.771
I promise to always sleep
with my feet on yours.

01:19:22.206 --> 01:19:25.706
And I promise to never speak
to your brother

01:19:25.708 --> 01:19:28.246
ever again.

01:19:30.680 --> 01:19:32.649
He just needs some time.

01:19:33.850 --> 01:19:36.186
I need you to know
that I did love him.

01:19:38.622 --> 01:19:40.658
I think we both still do.

01:19:43.194 --> 01:19:45.460
I'm so sorry about the shit
I pulled today.

01:19:45.462 --> 01:19:47.662
I... I'm an idiot.

01:19:47.664 --> 01:19:51.403
I know exactly who the person
is that I'm marrying.

01:19:54.305 --> 01:19:56.871
That person grew up because
of you.

01:20:13.356 --> 01:20:15.590
Look, I'm dreadfully sorry

01:20:15.592 --> 01:20:19.160
about that misunderstanding
this afternoon.

01:20:19.162 --> 01:20:21.396
Shh.

01:20:21.398 --> 01:20:24.202
Now, you can have mine, too.

01:20:38.815 --> 01:20:41.318
I know about you and Roy.

01:20:44.220 --> 01:20:45.620
Uh...

01:20:45.622 --> 01:20:48.259
I would have appreciated
an invitation.

01:21:50.421 --> 01:21:51.523
Okay.

01:23:25.948 --> 01:23:28.916
Oh yes... a little bit... yes...

01:23:28.918 --> 01:23:31.320
Like that! That's so great!

01:23:31.322 --> 01:23:34.089
Albert, move yourself!
Get me another bloody Mary!

01:23:34.091 --> 01:23:37.925
- It's a fuckin' emergency.
- Oh, in that case, uh...

01:23:37.927 --> 01:23:41.032
Whoa!
