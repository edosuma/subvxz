WEBVTT

00:00.801 --> 00:04.003
<i> PREVIOUSLY ON</i>
PRETTY LITTLE LIARS...

00:04.005 --> 00:05.437
AREN'T YOU BOTH GOING
TO THE MUSEUM THING?

00:05.439 --> 00:07.439
SPENCER GOT THE TICKETS
FOR ME AND EZRA.

00:07.441 --> 00:11.143
PLEASE, JUST DON'T GO TONIGHT,
OKAY? I HAVE A BAD FEELING
ABOUT THIS DATE.

00:11.145 --> 00:12.978
I THINK THAT BAD FEELING
IS CALLED JEALOUSY.

00:12.980 --> 00:15.714
THEY HAD A BIG OPENING
AT THE PHILADELPHIA ART MUSEUM.

00:15.716 --> 00:17.116
YOU WENT LAST NIGHT?

00:17.118 --> 00:19.118
WHY IS HE OUT OF JAIL?
HE'S OUT ON BAIL.

00:19.120 --> 00:22.755
WHY DON'T YOU SAVE US
THE COST OF A TRIAL
AND DROP DEAD!

00:22.757 --> 00:25.991
YOU'LL HAVE TO DO MORE
THAN BREAK RECORDS IF YOU
WANNA BECOME TEAM CAPTAIN.

00:25.993 --> 00:27.359
WHO SAID I WANTED
TO BECOME CAPTAIN?

00:27.361 --> 00:29.361
WHAT THE HELL?!

00:29.363 --> 00:30.996
I TAKE CARE OF THINGS MYSELF.

00:30.998 --> 00:33.599
YOU REMEMBER THAT PHONY
YOUR SISTER USED TO DATE?

00:33.601 --> 00:36.101
IAN THOMAS?
THEY PARTIED THAT WHOLE SUMMER.

00:36.103 --> 00:37.703
HE'S THE POSTER BOY
FROM PREPPY.

00:37.705 --> 00:39.104
CONVINCING, ISN'T HE?

00:39.106 --> 00:41.440
SO YOU WANNA GIVE IT
BACK TO YOUR TEACHER

00:41.442 --> 00:43.308
OR PUT IT ON
YOUR CHARM BRACELET?
WHAT IS THAT?

00:43.310 --> 00:45.411
IT'S WHAT STOPPED
MRS. MONTGOMERY
FROM GETTING TO PHILLY.

00:45.413 --> 00:47.312
WHO'S THIS FROM?
PAIGE.

00:47.314 --> 00:49.715
SHE'S TRYING TO BRIBE HER WAY
TO BECOMING THE NEXT
TEAM CAPTAIN.

00:49.717 --> 00:51.216
DO YOU THINK THEY'RE
FROM THE SAME PLACE?

00:51.218 --> 00:55.254
THESE TWO WERE PURCHASED
BY A SPENCER HASTINGS.

00:55.256 --> 00:57.689
DOES THAT HELP, DEAR?

01:17.745 --> 01:20.312
AH, SO IT'S JUST GONNA BE
YOU AND YOUR BROTHER TONIGHT,

01:20.314 --> 01:22.514
AND HE WANTS TO ORDER IN
FROM SAUSAGE HEAVEN.

01:22.516 --> 01:24.183
AGAIN? SERIOUSLY?

01:24.185 --> 01:28.187
DAD, THE CLOSEST THING
THEY HAVE TO A VEGETABLE
IS A PAPER PLATE.

01:28.189 --> 01:31.056
LISTEN, JUST TELL MIKE
THAT IT'S YOUR NIGHT TO PICK,
OKAY?

01:31.058 --> 01:33.692
OKAY. SO YOU'RE DEFINITELY
NOT EATING WITH US?

01:33.694 --> 01:36.695
UH, NO, NO,
I--I'VE GOT THIS THING.

01:36.697 --> 01:39.264
IT'S WITH THE HEAD
OF THE DEPARTMENT,

01:39.266 --> 01:41.400
AND DINNER'S INCLUDED, SO...

01:41.402 --> 01:42.534
HAVE A GREAT DAY, SWEETHEART.

01:44.505 --> 01:46.205
OH, HEY, DAD,

01:46.207 --> 01:48.640
I NEED YOUR PLEDGE
FOR THE DANCE MARATHON.

01:48.642 --> 01:49.741
THE DEADLINE'S TODAY.

01:49.743 --> 01:51.210
OH. OH, RIGHT.
THAT'S RIGHT.

01:51.212 --> 01:53.979
UH, MY CHECKBOOK
IS IN MY JACKET IN THE HALL.

02:02.590 --> 02:03.755
DID YOU FIND IT?

02:03.757 --> 02:05.257
WHAT?

02:05.259 --> 02:06.892
UM, YEAH.

02:08.429 --> 02:09.595
GREAT.

02:09.597 --> 02:12.097
DAD, WHAT'S THIS?

02:12.099 --> 02:15.234
WELL, THAT'S A TICKET
FOR THE MUSEUM.

02:18.172 --> 02:20.239
IS IT YOURS?

02:20.241 --> 02:23.275
NO, NO, IT'S, UH,
IT'S YOUR MOTHER'S.

02:25.980 --> 02:27.513
UH, HER CAR BROKE DOWN,

02:27.515 --> 02:32.718
AND SHE NEEDED TO BORROW MINE
TO GET THERE.

02:32.720 --> 02:37.689
SO SHE WAS AT THE MUSEUM
ON THURSDAY NIGHT?

02:37.691 --> 02:39.691
YEAH.

02:39.693 --> 02:42.194
I--I MEAN,
I--I THINK SO.

02:45.299 --> 02:48.133
YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY,

02:48.135 --> 02:50.802
YOU SHOULD REALLY
JUST TALK TO YOUR MOM
ABOUT THAT.

02:52.406 --> 02:53.438
HERE YOU GO.

02:53.440 --> 02:54.273
THANKS.

03:01.515 --> 03:03.749
IS MY CHEMISTRY BOOK
OVER THERE?

03:03.751 --> 03:06.218
UH, I DON'T SEE IT.

03:06.220 --> 03:09.521
IT'S PROBABLY IN THE ROOM,
SPENCE, NOT THE FRONTYARD.

03:09.523 --> 03:12.858
WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE CAVANAUGHS' MAILBOX?
SOMEBODY HIT IT?

03:12.860 --> 03:16.428
IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME,
AND I'M SURE
IT WASN'T AN ACCIDENT.

03:16.430 --> 03:21.266
EVERY TIME I COME HOME,
TOBY'S OUT THERE
CLEANING UP SOME NEW MESS.

03:21.268 --> 03:23.802
AND PLEASE DON'T SAY
HE DESERVES IT.

03:23.804 --> 03:25.504
I WASN'T GONNA SAY THAT.

03:28.742 --> 03:29.775
IS THAT IT?

03:31.612 --> 03:32.644
THANKS.

03:37.384 --> 03:40.052
DO YOU STILL THINK
THAT SOMEBODY FRAMED HIM?

03:40.054 --> 03:43.422
TOBY? DO WE REALLY WANNA
HAVE THIS FIGHT RIGHT NOW?

03:43.424 --> 03:46.291
I HAVE TO SAVE UP
SOME OF MY ENERGY
FOR SWIM PRACTICE.

03:46.293 --> 03:49.228
WE'RE NOT ON DIFFERENT SIDES
ANYMORE, EM.

03:49.230 --> 03:51.129
I MEAN, I KNOW WHAT
IT FEELS LIKE TO HAVE SOMEBODY

03:51.131 --> 03:53.165
SAY THAT YOU DID SOMETHING
WHEN YOU KNOW THAT YOU DIDN'T.

03:53.167 --> 03:55.434
ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT THE BRACELETS?

03:55.436 --> 03:57.202
I'D NEVER SEEN THAT
BEAD LADY BEFORE THAT DAY,

03:57.204 --> 03:59.671
AND YET SHE HAD
MY NAME WRITTEN DOWN
ON TWO SALES RECEIPTS.

04:02.276 --> 04:04.610
WE SHOULD GO.
WE'RE GONNA BE LATE.

04:04.612 --> 04:07.112
I OWE YOU AN APOLOGY.

04:07.114 --> 04:09.781
SERIOUSLY.
YOU BELIEVED THAT HE
WAS INNOCENT FROM DAY ONE,

04:09.783 --> 04:12.284
AND I JUMPED DOWN YOUR THROAT.

04:12.286 --> 04:17.356
I SAID SOME REALLY
HEINOUS THINGS ABOUT TOBY.

04:17.358 --> 04:20.125
YOU SHOUOLD APOLOGIZE TO HIM,
NOT ME.

04:45.552 --> 04:46.585
HEY.

04:46.587 --> 04:49.388
HEY. CUTE BOOTS. NEW?

04:49.390 --> 04:50.622
OH, ISH.

04:50.624 --> 04:52.391
WHAT IS WITH THIS LINE?

04:52.393 --> 04:54.459
( sighs )
ALL THE VENDING MACHINES
ARE ON LOCKDOWN.

04:54.461 --> 04:57.596
SOMEONE'S BEEN
BREAKING INTO THEM AFTER HOURS
AND STEALING FOOD.

04:57.598 --> 05:00.565
I HEARD THIS ONE KID
SAY THE ALARM WENT OFF
AT LIKE 3:00 A.M.

05:00.567 --> 05:01.833
WHAT, THE VENDING MACHINES
HAVE ALARMS?

05:01.835 --> 05:03.235
SCHOOL.

05:03.237 --> 05:05.170
SOMEONE'S BEEN
SNEAKING OUT OF THE BUILDING

05:05.172 --> 05:07.639
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT,
WHICH MAKES ZERO SENSE.

05:07.641 --> 05:10.509
WHO'D WANNA BE HERE
ANY LONGER THAN THEY HAVE TO?

05:10.511 --> 05:14.012
HMM, WELL, I MIGHT.
GOING HOME JUST GOT SCARY.

05:14.014 --> 05:16.048
THIS WAS IN MY DAD'S COAT.

05:17.618 --> 05:19.318
HE SAID IT'S MY MOM'S,

05:19.320 --> 05:21.753
BUT I'M STARTING TO WONDER
IF HE WAS AT THE MUSEUM, TOO.

05:21.755 --> 05:24.423
YOUR DAD? NO.

05:24.425 --> 05:26.558
WHY WAS HE SO TWITCHY
WHEN I ASKED?

05:26.560 --> 05:30.062
IF THEY BOTH WERE THERE
THE SAME NIGHT AS ME AND EZRA--

05:30.064 --> 05:32.064
ARIA, YOU'RE JUST ON A LOOP.

05:32.066 --> 05:35.701
IT WAS A COINCIDENCE.
IS IT?

05:35.703 --> 05:39.071
HAN, COME ON, YOU DON'T THINK
IT'S WEIRD THAT MY MOM
HAD A TICKET THE SAME NIGHT?

05:39.073 --> 05:41.373
YES, A WEIRD COINCIDENCE.

05:41.375 --> 05:43.408
( sighs )

05:45.512 --> 05:49.348
UM, CAN YOU GET MY COFFEE?
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

05:49.350 --> 05:50.182
UM...

05:56.757 --> 05:58.256
WE NEED TO TALK.

05:58.258 --> 06:01.626
YOU KNOW THAT THING YOU DID
WITH MRS. MONTGOMERY'S CAR?

06:01.628 --> 06:04.930
WELL, JUST PRETEND
LIKE IT NEVER HAPPENED, OKAY?

06:04.932 --> 06:08.100
DON'T TALK ABOUT IT,
DON'T BLOG ABOUT IT,
DON'T TWEET ABOUT IT. CLEAR?

06:08.102 --> 06:10.569
CAN I SPEAK NOW?

06:10.571 --> 06:12.637
OKAY, IF YOU MUST,
BUT IT'S REALLY ANNOYING.

06:12.639 --> 06:15.374
THE WAY I SEE IT, YOU OWE ME.

06:15.376 --> 06:16.775
FOR WHAT?

06:16.777 --> 06:19.544
FOR DOING THAT THING
I CAN'T TALK, BLOG,
OR TWEET ABOUT.

06:22.750 --> 06:23.882
( scoffs )

06:26.854 --> 06:27.886
( phone beeps )

06:51.879 --> 06:54.212
<i> ¶ GOT A SECRET,</i>
<i> CAN YOU KEEP IT? ¶</i>

06:54.214 --> 06:56.615
<i> ¶ SWEAR THIS ONE</i>
<i> YOU'LL SAVE ¶</i>

06:56.617 --> 06:59.251
<i> ¶ BETTER LOCK IT</i>
<i> IN YOUR POCKET ¶</i>

06:59.253 --> 07:01.520
<i> ¶ TAKING THIS ONE</i>
<i> TO THE GRAVE ¶</i>

07:01.522 --> 07:04.122
<i> ¶ IF I SHOW YOU</i>
<i> THEN I KNOW YOU ¶</i>

07:04.124 --> 07:07.159
<i> ¶ WON'T TELL WHAT I SAID ¶</i>

07:07.161 --> 07:09.461
<i> ¶ 'CAUSE TWO</i>
<i> CAN KEEP A SECRET ¶</i>

07:09.463 --> 07:11.663
<i> ¶ IF ONE OF THEM</i>
<i> IS DEAD ¶</i>

07:31.785 --> 07:34.653
WAS THERE A SECOND WATCH?
WAS ANYONE ELSE KEEPING TIME?

07:34.655 --> 07:38.156
IT WAS A TIE, PAIGE.
YOU AND EMILY TIED.

07:38.158 --> 07:40.725
SO WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN?
WHO GETS TO ANCHOR TOMORROW?

07:40.727 --> 07:42.160
CAN'T MAKE THAT DECISION YET.

07:42.162 --> 07:43.728
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN UP, SHARKS.

07:43.730 --> 07:47.499
WE'LL MEET TOMORROW MORNING,
SAME PLACE, SAME TIME,

07:47.501 --> 07:49.668
AND HAVE OURSELVES
A LITTLE SWIM-OFF.

07:49.670 --> 07:52.537
SO, I GUESS WE'LL JUST
FIGURE THIS OUT TOMORROW.

07:52.539 --> 07:55.474
YOU FIGURE IT OUT.
I NEED TO WIN.

08:02.583 --> 08:03.949
ARIA. HI, SWEETY.

08:03.951 --> 08:05.183
HEY, MOM.

08:05.185 --> 08:06.685
YOUR EARS
MUST'VE BEEN BURNING.

08:06.687 --> 08:08.019
WHY?

08:08.021 --> 08:11.890
I WAS JUST TALKING
TO THE PRINCIPAL
ABOUT YOU AND MR. FITZ.

08:11.892 --> 08:13.892
WHY?

08:13.894 --> 08:15.894
WELL, HE WANTS
TO TAKE YOUR CLASS

08:15.896 --> 08:17.696
TO NEW YORK TO SEE
THE FITZGERALD SHOW,

08:17.698 --> 08:20.165
BUT THE PRINCIPAL
TOLD HIM THERE WAS NO MONEY.

08:20.167 --> 08:22.033
DO YOU WANNA WALK WITH ME?

08:22.035 --> 08:23.702
SURE.

08:23.704 --> 08:25.871
WHAT'S UP?

08:25.873 --> 08:30.709
SO DAD WROTE ME
A CHECK THIS MORNING
FOR THE DANCE MARATHON.

08:30.711 --> 08:32.544
OKAY.

08:32.546 --> 08:34.713
AND WHEN I GOT
TO HIS CHECKBOOK,

08:34.715 --> 08:38.049
I FOUND THE TICKET
THAT WAS YOURS TO THE MUSEUM.

08:38.051 --> 08:40.118
I GUESS IT WAS IN DAD'S CAR.

08:40.120 --> 08:42.587
YOU DIDN'T MENTION
YOU BORROWED HIS CAR.

08:42.589 --> 08:44.890
OH, NO, WELL,
I DIDN'T THINK I HAD TO.

08:44.892 --> 08:48.059
WHY, DID YOU HAVE IT
ON RESERVE FOR THE NIGHT?

08:48.061 --> 08:52.063
NO, I'M...
I'M JUST CONFUSED.

08:52.065 --> 08:56.101
DID YOU GO TO THAT EXHIBIT
OR NOT?

08:56.103 --> 08:58.670
WELL, TO BE
PERFECTLY HONEST, NO.

08:58.672 --> 09:02.841
I SKIPPED IT, AND I WENT OUT TO
A REALLY NICE DINNER INSTEAD.

09:02.843 --> 09:03.742
BY YOURSELF?

09:03.744 --> 09:06.077
NO, UH, I WAS WITH A FRIEND.

09:06.079 --> 09:07.746
I GOTTA GET TO CLASS.

09:07.748 --> 09:09.080
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

09:17.391 --> 09:22.227
ARE YOU READING THAT FAST
OR FANNING YOURSELF?

09:22.229 --> 09:25.497
WHAT? UM, SORRY.

09:30.938 --> 09:32.637
WHERE YOU GOING?

09:32.639 --> 09:35.740
UM, I LEFT MY LIP GLOSS
IN THE HISTORY STACK.

09:35.742 --> 09:37.008
GOTTA FIND IT.

09:41.915 --> 09:43.081
( clears throat )

09:43.083 --> 09:44.549
( sighs )
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

09:44.551 --> 09:45.917
I'M CALLING IN YOUR DEBT.

09:45.919 --> 09:47.986
TWO LOSERS JUST BAILED
ON WHAT THEY OWE ME,

09:47.988 --> 09:49.554
AND I NEED SOME CASH RIGHT NOW.

09:49.556 --> 09:52.457
OKAY,
SO WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?
BUST THEIR KNEECAPS?

09:52.459 --> 09:54.159
I DON'T WANT AN ENFORCER.

09:54.161 --> 09:55.460
I WANT A DATE.

09:55.462 --> 09:57.696
( chuckles )
OKAY, ABSOLUTELY NOT.

09:57.698 --> 09:59.764
YOU'RE THE HOMECOMING QUEEN,
HANNA.

09:59.766 --> 10:02.968
YOU GOT A CERTAIN REP
AROUND HERE, AND I NEED
TO BORROW SOME OF YOUR CRED.

10:02.970 --> 10:04.502
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO WITH IT?

10:04.504 --> 10:06.504
I NEED CUSTOMERS...
WITH MONEY...

10:06.506 --> 10:08.773
WHO NEED TO KNOW
THEY CAN TRUST ME.

10:08.775 --> 10:09.908
YEAH, WELL, THEY CAN'T.

10:09.910 --> 10:11.610
THEY CAN IF I'M WITH YOU.

10:11.612 --> 10:13.979
SO YOU GOT A HOT PARTY
TOMORROW NIGHT?

10:13.981 --> 10:15.747
I HAVE A SWIM MEET.

10:15.749 --> 10:18.617
YOU CAN FIT ALL OF THAT
UNDER A CAP?

10:18.619 --> 10:21.886
I'M NOT SWIMMING, FREAK.
I'M CHEERING ON A FRIEND.

10:26.259 --> 10:28.026
( bell rings )

10:28.028 --> 10:29.828
WHAT IS THE POINT
OF A SWIM-OFF?

10:29.830 --> 10:32.831
WHY WOULD THE COACH
PIT YOU AGAINST EACH OTHER
BEFORE A MEET?

10:32.833 --> 10:35.500
SHE'S USING OUR COMBINED TIMES
TO CHOOSE ANCHOR,

10:35.502 --> 10:37.035
AND RIGHT NOW, WE'RE TIED.

10:37.037 --> 10:38.336
WELL, YOU'LL CHANGE THAT.

10:38.338 --> 10:41.172
MAYBE NOT.
SHE WANTS IT MORE.

10:41.174 --> 10:43.975
EMILY,<i> YOU</i> WANT IT MORE,

10:43.977 --> 10:46.277
AND IT IS OKAY TO ADMIT THAT.

10:46.279 --> 10:47.579
( chuckles )

10:51.284 --> 10:53.318
YOU KNOW WHO THAT'S FOR,
DON'T YOU?

10:53.320 --> 10:54.285
TOBY?

11:01.294 --> 11:02.961
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

11:02.963 --> 11:04.362
I MIGHT BE INTERESTED.

11:04.364 --> 11:07.032
SPENCER, DON'T. YOU CAN'T.
WHY NOT?

11:07.034 --> 11:09.367
BECAUSE YOU'D BE GOING THERE
FOR THE WRONG REASON.

11:09.369 --> 11:11.269
REALLY? WELL,
WHAT IF THE SAME PERSON

11:11.271 --> 11:13.038
WHO GAVE MY NAME
TO THE BEAD LADY

11:13.040 --> 11:14.339
IS THE ONE WHO FRAMED TOBY?

11:14.341 --> 11:16.174
WHAT IF THAT WAS "A"?

11:16.176 --> 11:17.809
CAN'T YOU
FIND THAT OUT SOME OTHER WAY?
WITHOUT ASKING HIM?

11:17.811 --> 11:19.577
WHO ELSE KNOWS
WHAT HE KNOWS, EMILY?

11:19.579 --> 11:21.012
IF I CAN GET HIM TO TALK--

11:21.014 --> 11:23.014
YOU WON'T EVEN GET HIM
TO LOOK AT YOU.

11:23.016 --> 11:24.149
HE DOESN'T TRUST US.

11:24.151 --> 11:25.984
HE DOESN'T TRUST
ANYONE ANYMORE.

11:25.986 --> 11:27.419
MAYBE, BUT IF I HAVE
ONE PIECE

11:27.421 --> 11:28.953
OF THE PUZZLE
AND HE HAS ANOTHER,

11:28.955 --> 11:32.190
THEN WE CAN PUT IT TOGETHER
AND MAYBE HELP EACH OTHER.

11:47.274 --> 11:48.373
( knock at door )

11:49.443 --> 11:51.309
HEY. YOU'RE A LITTLE EARLY.

11:51.311 --> 11:54.546
I JUST WANTED TO TELL YOU
I'M NOT COMING TO PRACTICE
TODAY.

11:54.548 --> 11:57.549
WHY NOT?
I HAVE ANOTHER COMMITMENT.

11:57.551 --> 12:00.485
YOU KNOW,
WHY DON'T YOU COME IN.
CLOSE THE DOOR.

12:00.487 --> 12:01.753
I CAN'T STAY. I'M--

12:01.755 --> 12:02.754
NO, COME IN.

12:08.695 --> 12:10.929
( door closes )

12:10.931 --> 12:13.431
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING
TO PULL HERE, SPENCER?

12:13.433 --> 12:15.066
ARE YOU GONNA TELL YOUR PARENTS
YOU CAN'T STAND TO BE

12:15.068 --> 12:16.935
ON THE SAME FIELD WITH ME
SO YOU'RE QUITTING THE TEAM?

12:16.937 --> 12:19.337
I'M NOT QUITTING THE TEAM.
I JUST HAVE THIS OTHER THING.

12:19.339 --> 12:21.039
YOU CAN'T AVOID ME.

12:21.041 --> 12:22.407
I LIVE IN YOUR BACKYARD.

12:22.409 --> 12:24.476
WELL, THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOU.
I'M...

12:24.478 --> 12:26.244
LOOK, I'M TOO CONCENTRATED
IN ATHLETICS,

12:26.246 --> 12:28.813
AND IT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD
ON MY COLLEGE APPLICATIONS.

12:28.815 --> 12:31.116
SO I JUST NEED
TO BALANCE OUT MY SCHEDULE.

12:33.420 --> 12:34.953
KNOCK-KNOCK.
HEY.

12:34.955 --> 12:36.788
SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

12:36.790 --> 12:38.790
I THOUGHT YOU HAD
A MARKETING SEMINAR.

12:38.792 --> 12:41.559
OH, THE PROFESSOR CANCELLED.
I BROUGHT THE TILE SAMPLES.

12:41.561 --> 12:44.062
THE CONTRACTOR
NEEDS A DECISION.
OH, GREAT.

12:44.064 --> 12:45.797
BYE.

12:45.799 --> 12:47.799
YEAH, I THINK YOUR SISTER'S
QUITTING THE TEAM.

12:47.801 --> 12:49.968
WHY?
I'M NOT QUITTING THE TEAM.

12:49.970 --> 12:52.470
I'M JUST DOING SOME TUTORING.

12:52.472 --> 12:54.105
WELL, ANYONE IN PARTICULAR?

12:54.107 --> 12:56.207
TOBY CAVANAUGH.

12:56.209 --> 12:58.009
WHAT?
WHAT?

12:58.011 --> 13:00.211
I SIGNED UP
TO HELP HIM WITH HIS FRENCH.

13:00.213 --> 13:02.213
I CAN'T BELIEVE THE SCHOOL
WOULD LET ANYONE NEAR HIM,
ESPECIALLY ALONE.

13:02.215 --> 13:03.515
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

13:03.517 --> 13:05.517
I ALREADY TOLD YOU.

13:05.519 --> 13:07.051
WHAT IS THIS
REALLY ABOUT?

13:07.053 --> 13:09.287
THAT KID MURDERED
ONE OF YOUR BEST FRIENDS.

13:09.289 --> 13:12.157
WAIT, DON'T TELL ME
YOU'RE FALLING FOR THAT
SILENT MARTYR CRAP.

13:12.159 --> 13:14.325
OKAY, YOU CAN'T BELIEVE
A THING THAT CREEP SAYS.

13:14.327 --> 13:17.295
WELL, TOBY CAVANAUGH
HASN'T CORNERED
THE MARKET ON LYING.

13:20.467 --> 13:21.533
I BETTER TO GO.

13:51.097 --> 13:52.297
HI.

13:52.299 --> 13:54.265
I--I NOTICED THIS
WAS ON THE GROUND

13:54.267 --> 13:56.134
AS I WAS WALKING UP.

14:01.208 --> 14:03.875
WAIT, I'M HERE TO TUTOR YOU.

14:06.046 --> 14:08.279
SOMEONE FROM THE SCHOOL
CALLED TO TELL YOU,
DIDN'T THEY?

14:14.521 --> 14:16.521
WHY YOU?

14:16.523 --> 14:19.390
BECAUSE I'M IN A.P. FRENCH...

14:19.392 --> 14:21.559
AND I VOLUNTEERED.

14:21.561 --> 14:23.995
LOOK, I HAVE ALL YOUR
ASSIGNMENTS TOGETHER,

14:23.997 --> 14:26.865
AND I WORKED OUT A SCHEDULE
FOR THE REST OF THE SEMESTER.

14:26.867 --> 14:30.001
IF WE MEET FOR
THREE TIMES A WEEK, WE CAN--

14:33.306 --> 14:35.440
YOU CAN'T COME IN.

14:35.442 --> 14:37.275
JENNA'S HOME.

14:37.277 --> 14:39.110
OKAY.

14:39.112 --> 14:41.813
WELL, IS THERE
SOMEWHERE ELSE WE CAN GO?

14:41.815 --> 14:45.116
I--I CAN'T GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.

14:45.118 --> 14:48.820
WELL, WILL JENNA MIND
IF WE SIT OUT HERE ON THE PORCH?

14:57.230 --> 14:59.831
JUST DON'T THINK ABOUT IT.
IT'LL MAKE YOU CRAZY.

14:59.833 --> 15:02.000
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO NOT THINK ABOUT IT?

15:02.002 --> 15:04.335
IT'S TOO FREAKY.
IF MY MOM'S CAR
HADN'T STALLED--

15:04.337 --> 15:05.536
WELL, IT DID.

15:05.538 --> 15:08.406
DON'T LOOK A GIFT CARD
IN THE MOUTH.

15:08.408 --> 15:10.475
THE UNIVERSE
GAVE YOU A PASS.

15:10.477 --> 15:12.977
THAT'S NOT THE UNIVERSE
I KNOW.

15:12.979 --> 15:15.980
WELL, LOOK,
IT ALL WORKED OUT, OKAY,
AND THAT'S WHAT COUNTS.

15:15.982 --> 15:19.083
MAYBE THE UNIVERSE
GOT A LITTLE HELP FROM SOMEONE--

15:19.085 --> 15:21.486
SOMEONE WITH
REALLY GOOD INTENTIONS.

15:21.488 --> 15:22.453
SHH.

15:23.957 --> 15:26.291
THAT'S GREAT.
I CAN PICK YOU UP.

15:26.293 --> 15:30.228
I CAN FIND YOU IN THE DARK.
I'VE DONE IT BEFORE.

15:30.230 --> 15:32.130
OKAY, I'LL SEE YOU SOON. BYE.

15:32.132 --> 15:34.165
( phone beeps )

15:34.167 --> 15:35.366
HEY.

15:35.368 --> 15:38.036
SO YOU'RE NOT GOING TO THAT
DEPARTMENT DINNER ANYMORE?

15:38.038 --> 15:40.371
OH, NO, NO.

15:40.373 --> 15:42.573
WAS THAT MOM
YOU WERE TALKING TO?

15:42.575 --> 15:45.176
UH, NO, NO, NO, IT WASN'T.

15:45.178 --> 15:48.212
SO YOU SURE YOU GUYS
ARE GONNA BE OKAY
HERE ALONE TONIGHT?

15:48.214 --> 15:49.881
SURE.

15:49.883 --> 15:50.715
OKAY.

15:55.822 --> 15:57.989
OKAY, LOOK, ARIA,
EVEN IF IT WASN'T
THE UNIVERSE--

15:57.991 --> 15:58.823
SHH.

15:59.960 --> 16:01.459
( door shuts )

16:01.461 --> 16:03.895
I'M JUST SAYING IF IT'S NOT
A COINCIDENCE, THEN MAYBE--

16:03.897 --> 16:05.697
COME ON.
WHERE ARE WE GOING?

16:05.699 --> 16:07.265
TO FOLLOW MY DAD.
WHERE?

16:07.267 --> 16:09.634
IF I KNEW THAT,
WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO FOLLOW HIM.
ARIA...

16:09.636 --> 16:12.303
HAN, MY DAD'S
ABOUT TO HAVE DINNER WITH
SOMEBODY IN THE DARK. MOVE IT.

16:23.116 --> 16:24.782
I BROUGHT YOU SOMETHING.

16:29.322 --> 16:30.788
L'ATTRAPE-COEURS.

16:30.790 --> 16:33.791
<i> THE HEARTCATCHER?</i>

16:33.793 --> 16:36.194
IT'S<i> CATCHER IN THE RYE.</i>

16:36.196 --> 16:38.429
I GUESS THERE'S
NO LITERAL TRANSLATION,

16:38.431 --> 16:41.232
BUT IT HELPS TO READ A BOOK
YOU ALREADY KNOW IN ENGLISH.

16:42.769 --> 16:44.736
HOW DO YOU KNOW I'VE READ IT?

16:44.738 --> 16:47.205
I SAW YOU ONCE...

16:47.207 --> 16:48.639
AT THE APPLE ROSE GRILLE.

16:48.641 --> 16:49.807
YOU WERE READING IT.

16:52.512 --> 16:54.545
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

16:54.547 --> 16:57.215
UH, MR. CARINCI
WANTS YOU TO REVIEW

16:57.217 --> 16:59.417
THE CONDITIONAL TENSE
AND THE WORKBOOK--

16:59.419 --> 17:01.719
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

17:01.721 --> 17:03.855
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
THAT I WANT SOMETHING?

17:03.857 --> 17:06.824
BECAUSE YOU NEVER DO ANYTHING
WITHOUT A REASON.

17:06.826 --> 17:08.559
DID EMILY TELL YOU THAT?

17:08.561 --> 17:10.361
NOBODY HAD TO TELL ME THAT.

17:16.403 --> 17:19.904
I THINK MAYBE
YOU'RE BEING FRAMED.

17:19.906 --> 17:22.340
WHAT CHANGED YOUR MIND?

17:22.342 --> 17:25.910
I THINK SOMEBODY MIGHT BE TRYING
TO DO THE SAME THING TO ME.

17:25.912 --> 17:27.645
MAYBE THE SAME PERSON.

17:27.647 --> 17:29.781
HOW'S THAT FEEL?

17:29.783 --> 17:33.718
NOT GOOD. SCARY.

17:33.720 --> 17:38.523
WHY WOULD SOMEBODY
GO AFTER YOU?

17:38.525 --> 17:40.491
WHAT MAKES YOU SO IMPORTANT?

17:42.529 --> 17:44.495
I DON'T KNOW.

17:46.266 --> 17:49.934
MAYBE YOU KNOW SOMETHING
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO KNOW.

17:49.936 --> 17:52.503
WELL, EVERY TIME
I THINK I KNOW SOMETHING,

17:52.505 --> 17:55.807
I GET THE RUG
PULLED OUT FROM UNDER ME,
AND I END UP ON MY ASS.

17:55.809 --> 17:57.475
<i> C'EST DOMMAGE.</i>

17:58.645 --> 17:59.710
( speaking French )

18:03.416 --> 18:05.883
I'M SORRY...

18:05.885 --> 18:08.453
FOR WHAT I SAID ABOUT YOU

18:08.455 --> 18:10.221
AND WHAT I THOUGHT.

18:16.563 --> 18:18.830
THE SWEATER
WITH ALISON'S BLOOD...

18:18.832 --> 18:22.567
YOU SAID THAT YOU
GAVE IT TO HER THAT NIGHT.

18:22.569 --> 18:23.868
I DID.

18:23.870 --> 18:26.871
AND THEN SHE GOT INTO A CAR.

18:26.873 --> 18:28.639
WITH SOME GUY.

18:28.641 --> 18:30.341
I COULDN'T SEE WHO IT WAS.

18:30.343 --> 18:32.643
I'M NOT SUPPOSED
TO TALK ABOUT THIS.

18:32.645 --> 18:35.847
DO YOU KNOW HOW THE SWEATER
COULD'VE GOTTEN BACK
INTO YOUR HOUSE?

18:35.849 --> 18:37.682
( bang )

18:40.453 --> 18:43.888
UH, I HAVE TO GO.

18:43.890 --> 18:46.891
THANKS FOR THE BOOK.

18:46.893 --> 18:48.359
YEAH, YOU'RE WELCOME.

18:57.837 --> 18:59.470
( zips bag )

19:06.012 --> 19:08.246
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON
GENETIC MODIFICATION?

19:09.849 --> 19:12.216
AREN'T SCIENTISTS PLAYING GOD?

19:12.218 --> 19:14.952
HOW WILL IT AFFECT HUMAN HEALTH
IN THE LONG TERM?

19:14.954 --> 19:17.421
SO I'M AGAINST IT.

19:17.423 --> 19:19.657
HE'S DIFFERENT.

19:19.659 --> 19:21.225
HOW?

19:21.227 --> 19:24.929
I MEANT, HE'S DIFFERENT
THAN I THOUGHT HE WOULD BE.

19:27.567 --> 19:31.802
"HOW HAVE HUMANS
ALTERED THE GENOMES OF SPECIES
FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS?"

19:31.804 --> 19:34.605
THROUGH ARTIFICIAL SELECTION.

19:34.607 --> 19:37.842
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT HIM
THAT'S...

19:37.844 --> 19:39.410
I DON'T KNOW.

19:39.412 --> 19:40.845
WOW.

19:40.847 --> 19:43.814
A QUESTION SPENCER HASTINGS
CAN'T ANSWER?

19:43.816 --> 19:46.551
INTERESTING.

19:46.553 --> 19:49.353
IT'S NOT THAT INTERESTING.

19:49.355 --> 19:51.522
AM I FINISHED
WITH<i> YOUR</i> HOMEWORK?

19:51.524 --> 19:52.757
YOU ARE.

19:52.759 --> 19:53.858
THANK YOU.

19:56.563 --> 19:57.728
( sighs )

19:57.730 --> 20:00.464
I KEEP TRYING
TO FIND A CONNECTION.

20:00.466 --> 20:02.633
TO TOBY?

20:02.635 --> 20:05.436
TO ALISON AND TOBY.

20:05.438 --> 20:06.771
ME AND TOBY.

20:08.841 --> 20:11.309
WE'RE PRETTY SURE
HE DIDN'T DO IT, RIGHT?

20:11.311 --> 20:14.445
AND YET SOMEBODY
FOUND A WAY TO MAKE HIM
LOOK EXTREMELY GUILTY.

20:14.447 --> 20:16.380
SPENCE, YOU CAN'T
FIGURE ALL THAT OUT

20:16.382 --> 20:19.250
SITTING ON HIS PORCH,
CONJUGATING VERBS.

20:19.252 --> 20:22.420
WELL, YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT THOSE VERBS ARE.

20:22.422 --> 20:25.489
IF HE DIDN'T TELL YOU
THE FIRST TIME,
HE PROBABLY CAN'T.

20:27.961 --> 20:31.796
ARE YOU SURE HE EVEN
WANTS YOU TO COME BACK?

20:31.798 --> 20:34.565
YEAH, I THINK HE DOES.

20:52.418 --> 20:56.687
WHY IS MY DAD
WALKING INTO OUR HIGH SCHOOL?

20:56.689 --> 20:58.522
OKAY, WEIRD.

20:58.524 --> 21:00.324
NOT REALLY.

21:00.326 --> 21:02.960
I MEAN, THINK ABOUT IT.
HE'S PROBABLY JUST GOING
TO SEE YOUR MOM.

21:02.962 --> 21:04.996
EM, THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

21:04.998 --> 21:07.665
PEOPLE LIE, ARIA.

21:07.667 --> 21:09.800
I MEAN, HELLO?

21:09.802 --> 21:12.270
WELL, WHAT ARE THEY DOING?

21:13.640 --> 21:14.839
CALL YOUR MOTHER.

21:14.841 --> 21:16.641
HUH?

21:16.643 --> 21:18.743
RIGHT NOW. CALL YOUR MOM.

21:18.745 --> 21:19.977
( phone dialing )

21:19.979 --> 21:21.779
( phone ringing )

21:21.781 --> 21:26.284
Ella:<i> HI, ARIA, HONEY.</i>
<i> I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT YOU.</i>

21:26.286 --> 21:28.219
<i> IS EVERYTHING OKAY?</i>

21:28.221 --> 21:31.022
YEAH. WHY WOULDN'T IT BE OKAY?

21:31.024 --> 21:33.057
<i> UH, WELL,</i>
<i> I DIDN'T MEAN TO SUGGEST</i>

21:33.059 --> 21:34.558
THAT EVERYTHING WASN'T OKAY.

21:34.560 --> 21:36.761
I WAS JUST ASKING,
CHECKING, WONDERING,

21:36.763 --> 21:38.262
<i> LIKE MOMS DO.</i>

21:38.264 --> 21:39.697
WHERE ARE YOU?

21:40.833 --> 21:42.199
HOME.

21:42.201 --> 21:44.101
SHH. WHERE ARE YOU?

21:45.505 --> 21:46.971
HOME.

21:46.973 --> 21:49.707
OKAY, SO EVERYTHING'S OKAY THEN?

21:49.709 --> 21:51.776
YEAH.

21:51.778 --> 21:53.778
OKAY, I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER,
SWEETIE. BYE-BYE.

21:53.780 --> 21:55.813
<i> BYE.</i>
( sighs )

21:55.815 --> 21:58.816
OKAY, WELL,
SHE SAYS SHE'S HOME.

21:58.818 --> 22:00.685
DO YOU BELIEVE HER?

22:02.422 --> 22:03.754
I DON'T KNOW.

22:08.194 --> 22:09.927
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

22:09.929 --> 22:11.062
( door shuts )

22:11.064 --> 22:12.096
( sighs )

22:28.748 --> 22:30.781
( sighs )

22:30.783 --> 22:32.783
THAT'S NOT GOOD.

22:32.785 --> 22:34.852
MM. WHAT? YOU USED TO LIKE IT.

22:34.854 --> 22:36.987
NO, NO, NOT THAT, THIS--

22:36.989 --> 22:38.489
THE LYING,
THE SNEAKING AROUND.

22:38.491 --> 22:39.990
I FEEL LIKE A TEENAGER.

22:39.992 --> 22:41.726
YEAH, IT'S FUN, ISN'T IT?

22:46.099 --> 22:48.265
Byron: LISTEN, WE SHOULD
JUST TELL THE KIDS.

22:48.267 --> 22:52.870
WE CAN'T.
WE CAN'T TELL THEM
UNTIL WE KNOW WHAT THIS IS.

22:52.872 --> 22:54.271
( sighs )

22:54.273 --> 22:56.040
OKAY, I THINK I GOT EVERYTHING.

22:56.042 --> 22:57.775
LET'S GO.

22:57.777 --> 22:58.976
WATCH OUT FOR THAT.

23:04.684 --> 23:07.785
OH, MY GOD,
MY PARENTS ARE HAVING
AN AFFAIR WITH EACH OTHER!

23:33.813 --> 23:35.880
HANNA? HANNA?

23:37.316 --> 23:38.849
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

23:38.851 --> 23:40.518
COME UP HERE.

23:40.520 --> 23:41.352
HURRY!

23:45.124 --> 23:46.824
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?

23:46.826 --> 23:48.959
THIS.

23:48.961 --> 23:51.162
SOMEONE SENDING
A BUNCH OF TEXTS?

23:51.164 --> 23:52.963
SPENCER'S LAPTOP
DISAPPEARING?

23:52.965 --> 23:55.566
OUR LOCKERS BROKEN INTO?

23:55.568 --> 23:58.836
ALL THIS STUFF
HAPPENED AT SCHOOL.
THIS IS "A."

23:58.838 --> 24:00.771
LET'S JUST GET OUT OF HERE.

24:00.773 --> 24:01.939
COME ON.

24:12.752 --> 24:14.218
HANNA, YOU'RE TAKING THAT?

24:14.220 --> 24:16.253
YES, "A" OWES ME--

24:16.255 --> 24:19.023
HOSPITAL BILLS,
PAIN AND SUFFERING,

24:19.025 --> 24:20.791
TIRE MARKS
ON MY CLEAVAGE.

24:24.096 --> 24:25.196
IT'S--IT'S NOTHING.

24:25.198 --> 24:27.031
THE LIGHTS
ARE PROBABLY ON A TIMER.

24:27.033 --> 24:28.098
( bang )

24:32.805 --> 24:34.004
WE SHOULD GO.

24:37.043 --> 24:38.876
( both scream )

24:43.449 --> 24:44.315
COME ON!

24:50.923 --> 24:52.389
( screams )

25:00.700 --> 25:02.099
( screams )

25:04.871 --> 25:07.204
CALEB?

25:07.206 --> 25:08.806
( groans )

25:13.145 --> 25:15.980
HOW'S YOUR EYE? ANY BETTER?

25:15.982 --> 25:17.781
IT'S STILL BURNING.

25:17.783 --> 25:19.783
YOU WANT A SHARP STICK
FOR THE OTHER ONE?

25:19.785 --> 25:22.620
IT WAS JUST HAIR SPRAY.
IT WAS LIGHT HOLD.

25:22.622 --> 25:24.855
WHAT WERE YOU DOING
IN THERE ANYWAY?

25:24.857 --> 25:27.191
I'M SORT OF, UM...

25:27.193 --> 25:28.292
I'M CRASHING HERE.

25:28.294 --> 25:31.061
YOU ARE? WHY?
WHAT DO YOU CARE?

25:31.063 --> 25:33.564
DON'T SNAP AT HER LIKE THAT.
I HAVE MORE.

25:33.566 --> 25:34.932
FIRE AWAY.

25:34.934 --> 25:37.167
JUST GIVE ME
MY MONEY BACK FIRST.

25:37.169 --> 25:40.070
WHERE DO YOUR PARENTS
THINK YOU ARE?

25:40.072 --> 25:41.639
( chuckles )

25:41.641 --> 25:42.973
MY FOSTER PARENTS
DON'T CARE WHERE I AM...

25:42.975 --> 25:45.075
AS LONG AS THEY
KEEP GETTING THEIR CHECKS.

25:45.077 --> 25:46.677
WAIT, I THOUGHT
ALL THAT STUFF

25:46.679 --> 25:48.646
ABOUT THE SOCIAL WORKER
WAS A JOKE.

25:48.648 --> 25:51.849
BELIEVE ME,
MY SOCIAL WORKER IS A JOKE,

25:51.851 --> 25:53.651
BUT, YEAH, I DO HAVE ONE.

25:53.653 --> 25:56.854
THIS IS CRAZY.
YOU CAN'T KEEP STAYING HERE.

25:56.856 --> 25:59.290
WHY? THERE'S HOT WATER,
VENDING MACHINES,

25:59.292 --> 26:00.991
THE PRINCIPAL'S COUCH
IS PRETTY COMFORTABLE.

26:00.993 --> 26:02.793
WELL, THEY KNOW
SOMEONE WAS HERE LAST NIGHT.

26:04.263 --> 26:07.798
YEAH. I GOT SLOPPY.

26:07.800 --> 26:09.300
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

26:09.302 --> 26:11.835
GRAB SOME DINNER,
THEN BACK TO BED.

26:14.240 --> 26:15.973
YOU KNOW YOUR WAY OUT, RIGHT?

26:23.282 --> 26:26.016
( thunderclap )

26:26.018 --> 26:27.451
( rain falling )

26:30.790 --> 26:31.989
( thunderclap )

26:31.991 --> 26:33.123
( phone beeps)

26:41.801 --> 26:42.933
( thunderclap )

26:47.740 --> 26:49.873
PAIGE?

26:49.875 --> 26:52.276
ARE YOU OKAY?

26:52.278 --> 26:54.044
NO.

26:54.046 --> 26:56.046
WHAT HAPPENED?

26:56.048 --> 26:57.348
( chuckles )

26:57.350 --> 27:01.051
YOU HAVE EVERY REASON
TO HATE ME.

27:01.053 --> 27:04.154
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY I'M HERE.

27:04.156 --> 27:06.991
I DON'T HATE YOU.

27:06.993 --> 27:08.993
I WOULD.

27:08.995 --> 27:10.995
I DO.

27:10.997 --> 27:13.364
DON'T SAY THAT.

27:13.366 --> 27:15.432
I'M SORRY, EMILY.

27:19.071 --> 27:21.038
I JUST WANTED YOU TO KNOW THAT.

27:24.710 --> 27:26.176
WAIT, PAIGE...

27:28.247 --> 27:29.480
( thunderclap )

27:34.053 --> 27:35.853
( thunderclap )

27:38.024 --> 27:41.025
GOOD MORNING, SHARKS.
HOW WE ALL DOING TODAY?

27:41.027 --> 27:42.626
All: READY TO SWIM, COACH!

27:42.628 --> 27:44.628
I'M SORRY, I CAN'T HEAR YOU.

27:44.630 --> 27:46.830
All: READY TO SWIM, COACH!

27:46.832 --> 27:48.866
THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT,
ALL RIGHT.

27:48.868 --> 27:51.602
IT'S OUR LAST PRACTICE BEFORE
THIS AFTERNOON'S BIG MEET,

27:51.604 --> 27:53.437
SO LET'S MAKE IT
A GOOD ONE.

27:53.439 --> 27:55.439
OH, EMILY, THERE'S NOT
GONNA BE A SWIM-OFF.

27:55.441 --> 27:58.075
I JUST GOT WORD THAT PAIGE
WILL NOT BE JOINING US.

27:58.077 --> 27:59.843
WHY NOT?

27:59.845 --> 28:02.146
SHE HAD AN ACCIDENT
WHILE RIDING HER BIKE
LAST NIGHT.

28:02.148 --> 28:06.050
SHE'S JUST A LITTLE BANGED-UP.
SHE'LL BE BACK SWIMMING
IN NO TIME.

28:06.052 --> 28:08.819
OKAY, LADIES, IN THE WATER,
IN THE WATER! COME ON!

28:17.163 --> 28:18.529
YOU'RE LATE.
LET'S GO IN.

28:18.531 --> 28:20.531
WAIT, CAN WE TALK
ABOUT LAST NIGHT?

28:20.533 --> 28:22.332
WHAT IS THERE TO TALK ABOUT?

28:22.334 --> 28:23.867
UM, THE FACT THAT
YOU'RE HIDING OUT

28:23.869 --> 28:25.536
IN THE A.V. CLOSET
UNTIL GRADUATION.

28:25.538 --> 28:27.104
WHAT'S YOUR PLAN?

28:27.106 --> 28:28.939
ALL RIGHT, DO YOU WANNA
PLAY GUIDANCE COUNSELOR

28:28.941 --> 28:31.108
OR DO YOU WANNA
PAY OFF YOUR DEBT?

28:31.110 --> 28:32.476
I'M CASHING IN ON THAT FAVOR.

28:32.478 --> 28:35.579
POINT OUT THE KIDS
WHO HAVE MONEY TO BURN.

28:35.581 --> 28:37.347
FINE, I'LL TRADE YOU--

28:37.349 --> 28:39.049
ONE NAME FOR ONE ANSWER.

28:41.220 --> 28:42.586
OH, HEY, BRIDGET.
HEY, HANNA.

28:42.588 --> 28:44.455
YOU KNOW MY FRIEND CALEB,
RIGHT?

28:44.457 --> 28:46.623
SORT OF.

28:46.625 --> 28:47.991
HEY.

28:50.196 --> 28:52.930
BRIDGET WU--
TOTAL PARTY GIRL.

28:52.932 --> 28:54.832
BRING HER A BOTTLE
OF SOMETHING STRONG,

28:54.834 --> 28:56.400
AND SHE'S
YOUR NEW BEST FRIEND.

28:56.402 --> 28:58.402
WHERE ARE YOU FROM?

28:58.404 --> 28:59.636
A LOT OF PLACES.

28:59.638 --> 29:01.138
I GAVE DETAILS.

29:01.140 --> 29:02.840
( sighs )

29:02.842 --> 29:06.276
SEATTLE, SALT LAKE,
DENVER, CHICAGO, AND HERE.

29:06.278 --> 29:07.478
YOUR TURN.

29:09.482 --> 29:11.014
LINDSAY HOOVER.

29:11.016 --> 29:13.050
DON'T LET THE JESUS SANDALS
FOOL YOU.

29:13.052 --> 29:16.286
SHE'S GOT CASH. HER GRANDFATHER
INVENTED THE STAPLER.

29:16.288 --> 29:17.321
NICE.

29:17.323 --> 29:19.156
WANA GET TIGHT WITH HER?

29:19.158 --> 29:22.960
GROW A HIPSTER 'STACHE
AND START TALKING ABOUT
"THE MAN."

29:22.962 --> 29:26.196
WHY DON'T YOU REPORT
YOUR FOSTER PARENTS?

29:26.198 --> 29:27.965
TO WHO? MY SOCIAL WORKER?

29:27.967 --> 29:30.601
I'VE HAD FOUR
IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS.

29:30.603 --> 29:32.269
THEY CAN'T REMEMBER MY NAME.

29:32.271 --> 29:35.038
THE LAST ONE
CALLED ME "CALVIN."

29:35.040 --> 29:37.074
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW YOUR REAL PARENTS?

29:40.813 --> 29:43.947
IT'S GONNA TAKE A LOT MORE
THAN NAMES TO HEAR ABOUT THEM.

29:46.585 --> 29:49.753
( cheering )

29:58.130 --> 29:59.963
( laughing )

30:03.335 --> 30:05.402
TRUCE. GOT YOU A BUTTON.

30:05.404 --> 30:07.905
THANKS.
NO PROBLEM.

30:07.907 --> 30:10.707
I NEED TO BE SUPER RAH-RAH
NOW THAT I'M THE COACH'S WIFE.

30:10.709 --> 30:13.577
IT'S A SWIM MEET.
IT'S NOT EVEN HIS SPORT.

30:13.579 --> 30:16.613
AND WHAT'S YOURS,
BROTHER-IN-LAW BASHING?

30:16.615 --> 30:19.082
WHAT'S GOING ON
BETWEEN YOU AND IAN?

30:19.084 --> 30:20.984
WHY DON'T YOU ASK HIM?

30:20.986 --> 30:22.786
SOMETHING WRONG
WITH THAT PICTURE?

30:26.058 --> 30:30.093
I SEE MY HUSBAND
BUYING US HOT DOGS,

30:30.095 --> 30:33.463
AND I SEE YOU GOING OUT
OF YOUR WAY TO HUMILIATE HIM.

30:33.465 --> 30:35.065
WHAT WAS THAT
LYING CRACK ABOUT?

30:35.067 --> 30:36.934
HE DOES NOTHING
BUT TRY WITH YOU, SPENCER.

30:36.936 --> 30:39.069
WHEN ARE YOU GONNA
GIVE HIM A BREAK?
HONESTLY?

30:39.071 --> 30:41.271
WHEN I FIGURE OUT
WHY HE RUSHED BACK
TO ROSEWOOD

30:41.273 --> 30:42.706
AND RUSHED
INTO PROPOSING TO YOU.

30:42.708 --> 30:44.274
NO, YOU'VE GOT IT WRONG.

30:44.276 --> 30:46.143
I PROPOSED.
I WANTED TO ELOPE.

30:46.145 --> 30:49.313
YOU HAVE
A PROBLEM WITH MY MARRIAGE,
YOU TAKE IT UP WITH ME, NOT HIM.

30:49.315 --> 30:51.181
WELL, HIM IS THE PROBLEM.

30:51.183 --> 30:54.418
HE'S NOT BEEN
ENTIRELY HONEST WITH YOU,
AND I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

30:54.420 --> 30:55.819
ABOUT WHAT?

30:56.989 --> 30:59.122
YOU HAVE TO ASK HIM
ABOUT ALISON,

30:59.124 --> 31:01.458
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
THE SUMMER THAT SHE WAS KILLED.

31:01.460 --> 31:03.627
( laughs )
YOU REALLY ARE TOO MUCH.

31:03.629 --> 31:05.963
DID TOBY CAVANAUGH
PUT THAT IDEA IN YOUR HEAD?

31:08.267 --> 31:11.668
HEY. SORRY I TOOK SO LONG.
THEY WERE OUT OF
THE SPICY MUSTARD YOU LIKE.

31:11.670 --> 31:13.337
( chuckles )

31:15.241 --> 31:17.074
DID I MISS SOMETHING?

31:17.076 --> 31:20.077
NO, WE WERE JUST
TALKING ABOUT ALISON.

31:22.114 --> 31:24.815
IAN,
I'LL MEET YOU INSIDE.

31:24.817 --> 31:27.084
OKAY.

31:30.656 --> 31:33.523
LOOK, I'VE ALREADY LOST ONE
RELATIONSHIP BECAUSE OF YOU.

31:33.525 --> 31:36.260
YOU WILL NOT RUIN
MY MARRIAGE, TOO.

31:36.262 --> 31:38.228
MELISSA.
COMING.

31:48.307 --> 31:49.573
( cheering )

31:57.449 --> 31:59.650
WHEN'S EMILY GONNA JUMP IN?

31:59.652 --> 32:03.120
SHE'S THE ANCHOR.
SHE SWIMS LAST
'CAUSE SHE'S THE FASTEST.

32:03.122 --> 32:07.357
HEY, REMIND ME,
WHICH ONE'S LINDSAY
AND WHICH ONE'S BRIDGET?

32:07.359 --> 32:10.427
BRIDGET'S THE ONE
DRINKING FROM HER PURSE.

32:13.232 --> 32:15.732
THANKS. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

32:15.734 --> 32:17.734
Girl: COME ON, COME ON, COME ON!

32:17.736 --> 32:19.636
WHY ARE WE SITTING WITH CALEB?

32:19.638 --> 32:21.538
WHY NOT?

32:21.540 --> 32:24.474
HANNA, I LIKE STRAY DOGS, TOO,
BUT SOMETIMES THEY BITE.

32:24.476 --> 32:26.109
WELL, HE'S HAD HIS SHOTS.

32:26.111 --> 32:27.711
GO, EMILY!

32:27.713 --> 32:29.313
SHE'S NOT SWIMMING YET.

32:31.450 --> 32:34.151
( cheering )

33:02.047 --> 33:03.580
¶¶

33:18.630 --> 33:21.298
( cheering )

33:48.594 --> 33:52.162
( cheering )

34:20.959 --> 34:23.994
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GONNA TAKE
THE LONG WAY HOME.

34:23.996 --> 34:26.163
OKAY, I'LL SEE YOU LATER.
BYE.

34:30.803 --> 34:32.736
( phone beeps )

34:57.463 --> 34:59.863
WHAT'S THIS?

34:59.865 --> 35:02.466
MY EVICTION NOTICE.

35:02.468 --> 35:04.201
SORRY.

35:04.203 --> 35:05.869
YOU KNOW THAT
I DIDN'T TELL ANYBODY.

35:05.871 --> 35:08.872
I DIDN'T GO THERE.

35:08.874 --> 35:12.542
WELL, MAYBE IT'S FOR THE BEST.

35:12.544 --> 35:14.478
I MEAN,
THE PLACE HAD SMALL CLOSETS.

35:15.914 --> 35:17.547
I HATED THAT SHIRT ANYWAY.

35:19.551 --> 35:20.217
( sighs )

35:23.689 --> 35:25.589
CONSIDER YOUR DEBT PAID.

35:25.591 --> 35:27.290
HAVE A GOOD DAY.

35:27.292 --> 35:29.392
HEY,
IF YOU NEED A PLACE TO STAY--

35:29.394 --> 35:30.894
NO, THANKS.

35:30.896 --> 35:32.996
YOUR MOM
STARTS ASKING QUESTIONS,

35:32.998 --> 35:37.134
SOMEONE CALLS SOCIAL SERVICES,
AND IT'S JUST A BIG MESS.

35:37.136 --> 35:39.469
WAIT.

35:42.207 --> 35:45.942
THERE'S AN OLD COUCH
IN MY BASEMENT.

35:45.944 --> 35:47.711
MY MOM WILL NEVER KNOW.

35:58.590 --> 36:02.225
HANNA. HEY.
HERE YOU ARE.

36:02.227 --> 36:04.861
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BELIEVE
WHAT THIS SICK FREAK DID NOW.

36:04.863 --> 36:06.897
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
LOOK.

36:06.899 --> 36:08.832
I HAVE TO SAY, "A" IS SMART--

36:08.834 --> 36:10.600
TRYING TO PIT US
AGAINST EACH OTHER.

36:10.602 --> 36:12.936
YEAH, ARIA--
IT'S RELENTLESS.

36:12.938 --> 36:17.307
EVERY TIME WE SHUT A DOOR,
"A" KICKS OPEN A WINDOW.

36:17.309 --> 36:19.910
I GAVE YOUR MOM
THE MUSEUM TICKET.

36:22.648 --> 36:25.815
WHAT? WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

36:25.817 --> 36:30.053
"A" MADE ME DO IT.
"A" HAS SOMETHING ON ME.

36:30.055 --> 36:32.756
"A" HAS SOMETHING
ON ALL OF US, HANNA,

36:32.758 --> 36:37.294
BUT THERE'S NOTHING "A"
WOULD THREATEN ME WITH THAT
WOULD MAKE ME DO THAT TO YOU.

36:37.296 --> 36:39.329
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE MY BEST FRIEND.

36:39.331 --> 36:43.800
I KNOW, AND AS SOON
AS I PUT THE TICKET
IN YOUR MOM'S MAILBOX,

36:43.802 --> 36:45.969
I DID EVERYTHING
I COULD TO UNDO IT.

36:45.971 --> 36:47.804
THE REASON YOUR MOM
DIDN'T GET--

36:47.806 --> 36:49.606
STOP TALKING.

36:50.976 --> 36:52.842
THERE'S NOTHING
YOU COULD SAY

36:52.844 --> 36:54.544
THAT WOULD CHANGE THE WAY
I FEEL RIGHT NOW.

37:03.622 --> 37:04.921
YOU OKAY?

37:04.923 --> 37:08.291
YOU DIDN'T RETURN
ANY OF MY CALLS.

37:08.293 --> 37:09.993
I'M FINE.

37:09.995 --> 37:11.561
IT'S NOTHING.

37:14.600 --> 37:17.000
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

37:17.002 --> 37:21.738
I WAS RIDING HOME ON MY BIKE
AND TOTALLY WIPED OUT.

37:21.740 --> 37:23.540
WHAT WERE YOU
THINKING ABOUT?

37:23.542 --> 37:25.242
HOW EASY THING'S WOULD BE
<i> IF</i> I WIPED OUT.

37:28.847 --> 37:31.081
I'M KIND OF DONE
WITH SWIMMING.

37:31.083 --> 37:33.750
YEAH, I USED TO FEEL THAT WAY.

37:33.752 --> 37:35.185
OBVIOUSLY YOU GOT OVER IT.

37:39.024 --> 37:41.725
HOW DID YOU GET OVER IT?

37:41.727 --> 37:43.960
I STARTED SWIMMING FOR MYSELF.

37:43.962 --> 37:50.033
I QUIT TRYING BE BETTER
THAN EVERYONE ON THE TEAM,
AND I JUST RELAXED.

37:50.035 --> 37:51.635
SOUNDS FUN.

37:57.142 --> 37:59.576
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU SWAM FOR FUN?

38:02.381 --> 38:04.648
¶¶

39:13.452 --> 39:16.019
HEY.
HI, I GOT YOUR MESSAGE,

39:16.021 --> 39:17.921
BUT I DIDN'T
TOTALLY UNDERSTAND.

39:17.923 --> 39:19.689
THIS ISN'T GOING TO WORK.

39:19.691 --> 39:23.460
HERE, TAKE IT BACK.

39:23.462 --> 39:27.130
TOBY, I CAME HERE
BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT
WE COULD HELP EACH OTHER.

39:27.132 --> 39:29.933
WE CAN'T.

39:29.935 --> 39:31.768
JUST TAKE IT AND GO.

39:46.017 --> 39:47.851
¶¶

39:50.956 --> 39:53.223
( phone rings )

39:56.061 --> 39:57.160
( phone beeps )

40:00.399 --> 40:01.831
( sighs )

40:07.105 --> 40:09.172
Caleb: QUESTION.

40:09.174 --> 40:10.907
WHAT'S UP?

40:10.909 --> 40:12.609
UM, THE TOWELS
IN THE BATHROOM--

40:12.611 --> 40:15.712
ARE THEY LIKE THE FANCY
PEOPLE-ARE-COMING-OVER TOWELS?

40:15.714 --> 40:18.181
NO, YOU CAN USE THEM.

40:18.183 --> 40:21.751
I DON'T HAVE TO.
I CAN SHAKE OFF AND AIR DRY.

40:21.753 --> 40:23.420
PLEASE DON'T.

40:27.592 --> 40:33.062
WHAT'S GOING ON?
YOU WANT ME TO LEAVE?

40:33.064 --> 40:36.599
IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU.

40:36.601 --> 40:42.906
ARIA'S REALLY,
REALLY MAD AT ME.

40:42.908 --> 40:46.075
YOU KNOW THAT THING
I TOLD YOU NOT TO LEAK?

40:48.246 --> 40:50.013
SHE FOUND OUT ANYWAY?

40:52.551 --> 40:55.218
SHE'S NEVER GONNA
SPEAK TO ME AGAIN.

40:58.590 --> 41:00.356
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SIT HERE
AND LISTEN TO THIS.

41:00.358 --> 41:02.625
JUST GO TAKE YOUR SHOWER.

41:19.744 --> 41:21.277
IT CAN WAIT.

41:33.792 --> 41:35.158
GOOD NIGHT.

41:35.160 --> 41:36.626
WAIT, SPENCER.

41:36.628 --> 41:39.829
CAN WE TALK
ABOUT EARLIER?
NO.

41:39.831 --> 41:42.131
IT'S LATE, AND I'M TIRED.

41:42.133 --> 41:43.533
I KNOW ABOUT YOU AND IAN.

41:46.438 --> 41:48.304
HE TOLD ME EVERYTHING--

41:48.306 --> 41:50.273
THE THING YOU TWO HAD
WHEN WE WERE BROKEN UP.

41:50.275 --> 41:51.908
I CAN'T HOLD THAT AGAINST YOU.

41:51.910 --> 41:53.576
DID HE TELL YOU ANYTHING ELSE
ABOUT THAT SUMMER?

41:53.578 --> 41:56.012
WHATEVER IT IS
YOU'RE HOLDING ONTO,

41:56.014 --> 41:57.280
IT'S GOT TO STOP.

41:57.282 --> 41:58.448
I THINK HE'S DANGEROUS.

41:58.450 --> 42:00.149
AND I THINK YOU NEED HELP.

42:00.151 --> 42:02.151
YOU KEEP WANTING WHAT I HAVE.

42:02.153 --> 42:03.586
YOU KNOW WHAT, MELISSA?

42:03.588 --> 42:07.023
SPENCER, I DON'T WANT TO FIGHT.

42:07.025 --> 42:10.426
I REALIZE THAT I LOST MY TEMPER
EARLIER, AND I'M SORRY.

42:10.428 --> 42:12.428
I'VE BEEN A LITTLE
HORMONAL LATELY,

42:12.430 --> 42:16.966
AND I GUESS I SHOULD TELL YOU.

42:16.968 --> 42:18.968
TELL ME WHAT?

42:18.970 --> 42:22.038
WE'RE PREGNANT.

42:26.244 --> 42:28.978
THIS IS WHERE YOU SAY,
"CONGRATULATIONS."

42:32.250 --> 42:33.983
GOOD NIGHT, SIS.

43:01.212 --> 43:03.713
Man:<i> LEARNING FRENCH</i>
<i> CAN BE A FUN ACTIVITY</i>

43:03.715 --> 43:05.381
<i> FOR FAMILIES, FRIENDS,</i>
<i> CIVIC GROUPS OR CLUBS.</i>

43:05.383 --> 43:08.952
<i> BY LISTENING</i>
<i> TO THESE LONG-PLAYING,</i>
<i> HI-FIDELITY RECORDS,</i>

43:08.954 --> 43:12.121
<i> YOU CAN SPEAK FLUENTLY</i>
<i> IN AS LITTLE AS SIX WEEKS.</i>

43:12.123 --> 43:15.158
<i> WE'RE GOING TO START</i>
<i> WITH THE FRENCH VERB ETRE,</i>

43:15.160 --> 43:17.126
<i> WHICH MEANS "TO BE."</i>

43:17.128 --> 43:19.062
<i> READY? LET'S BEGIN.</i>

43:19.064 --> 43:21.431
<i> PRET? COMMENCONS.</i>

43:21.433 --> 43:23.866
<i> JE SUIS.</i> I AM...

43:23.868 --> 43:26.569
( record skipping )
<i> JE SUIS.</i> I AM...

43:26.571 --> 43:29.739
<i> JE SUIS.</i> I AM...
<i> JE SUIS.</i>
