01:41.409 --> 01:43.240
There's one more small box
in the back seat of the car, Brandon.

01:43.368 --> 01:44.136
l'll get it.

01:44.289 --> 01:47.125
- l got a good feeling about this, Nat.
- Oh, you think so?

01:47.335 --> 01:49.209
Yeah, did you read the brochure
my client sent?

01:49.379 --> 01:50.624
Yeah, it was pretty impressive.

01:50.798 --> 01:52.506
This is the perfect place
for one of these.

01:52.676 --> 01:55.631
You have a well-established clientele,
this'll bring in new traffic.

01:55.847 --> 01:57.674
Believe me,
that cash register's gonna ring.

01:57.850 --> 01:59.926
Oh, l hope you're right.

02:00.145 --> 02:02.019
Make sure the whole crew is here
tomorrow night

02:02.189 --> 02:05.357
when we crank this baby up,
because we are gonna rock 'n' roll.

02:35.321 --> 02:39.450
Okay, move those arms.
Feel the beat.

02:41.997 --> 02:44.703
Good. From the beginning.

02:52.387 --> 02:56.635
Go on, laugh all you want.
They hired me for comic relief.

02:56.852 --> 02:57.931
You're doing great.

02:58.104 --> 03:00.856
- Better than my friend here.
- Oh, thank you.

03:01.275 --> 03:05.060
- You must be a ringer.
- Actually, it's my first time.

03:05.281 --> 03:06.989
Oh, God, now l'm really humiliated.

03:07.701 --> 03:09.528
Okay, move our hips.

03:10.288 --> 03:12.447
lsolate, isolate.

03:12.667 --> 03:14.660
Who does he think l am, a Fly Girl?

03:14.878 --> 03:18.628
- Tim, can we focus here?
- l'm focusing.

03:19.426 --> 03:20.801
l'm focusing.

03:24.016 --> 03:27.386
- He's cute.
- Kelly, we're not here to meet guys.

03:27.563 --> 03:29.105
Suit yourself.

03:34.699 --> 03:38.745
Hi, my name is Sarah.

03:39.956 --> 03:41.664
And l'm an alcoholic.

03:41.876 --> 03:44.284
Hi, Sarah.

03:44.963 --> 03:47.834
l've been sober 50 days now.

03:48.010 --> 03:52.175
Unfortunately, they've been spread out
over the last four years.

03:53.559 --> 03:56.644
l wasn't that comfortable
with myself...

03:58.984 --> 04:00.858
...so drinking helped me fit in.

04:01.905 --> 04:04.860
- l know this girl.
- You sure?

04:05.034 --> 04:10.161
- l think she's a first-timer.
- l was drunk at school a lot.

04:12.253 --> 04:15.208
One time, l even tossed my cookies
in the principal's office.

04:16.968 --> 04:18.628
l'm 1 8 now.

04:20.139 --> 04:25.016
And about a year ago,
l thought l hit rock bottom.

04:28.610 --> 04:31.897
l got really wasted one time
l went surfing

04:32.115 --> 04:34.191
and nearly drowned.

04:34.953 --> 04:38.323
Some kids fished me out and
took me to the hospital just in time.

04:38.541 --> 04:40.997
My friends were the ones
who fished her out of the ocean.

04:41.170 --> 04:42.581
Then l met this guy.

04:45.301 --> 04:47.840
And we moved in together.

04:49.307 --> 04:50.932
And we drank together.

04:52.770 --> 04:58.359
About a couple weeks ago,
he beat me up pretty bad.

05:01.950 --> 05:04.239
And that's how l got here.

05:06.749 --> 05:09.786
l've been sober
for about a week now.

05:11.130 --> 05:13.170
And l guess that's a start.

05:21.478 --> 05:23.720
Up slowly.

05:25.150 --> 05:27.476
Okay, good night, everybody.

05:33.287 --> 05:36.989
- Hi, l'm Tim Matthews.
- Brenda Walsh.

05:37.210 --> 05:39.880
Let me guess. Actress? Dancer.

05:40.089 --> 05:41.667
Star Search spokesmodel?

05:42.175 --> 05:46.755
- No, l go to West Beverly.
- No kidding. l went to Beverly.

05:46.974 --> 05:49.762
l'm at UCLA now. Premed.

05:50.395 --> 05:53.350
Well, it's nice meeting you.
This is my friend Kelly.

05:53.567 --> 05:55.690
- Hello, friend Kelly.
- Hi.

05:55.903 --> 05:59.190
So listen, just about the last thing
l wanna do right now

05:59.367 --> 06:01.693
is go back to the dorm
and study organic chemistry.

06:01.870 --> 06:06.284
So l was wondering, maybe you'd like
to go get a bite to eat or something.

06:07.170 --> 06:08.712
Brenda.

06:09.006 --> 06:11.961
Sorry, but Kelly's my ride.
l have to go.

06:12.177 --> 06:13.837
Well, l could take you home.

06:14.639 --> 06:15.884
l don't think so.

06:16.099 --> 06:19.303
Okay. Well, maybe l can
call you sometime.

06:19.479 --> 06:21.389
- Well...
- Come on.

06:21.566 --> 06:24.236
- You do have a phone.
- Yes.

06:24.445 --> 06:25.726
So?

06:28.534 --> 06:31.156
So l also have a boyfriend.

06:31.371 --> 06:35.417
Oh, gee, and l only have a two-seater.
He's gonna have to stay home.

06:35.628 --> 06:37.253
Brenda.

06:38.298 --> 06:39.543
We really have to go.

06:39.759 --> 06:41.419
Well, l'll see you back here
Sunday night.

06:41.636 --> 06:43.178
Sunday night?

06:44.307 --> 06:45.932
Sure, see you then.

06:49.231 --> 06:51.770
Brenda, l thought we were only
coming to this class on Fridays,

06:51.943 --> 06:53.651
when Dylan's
at his AA meeting in Malibu.

06:53.821 --> 06:56.360
Well, l was thinking
l might need a little bit more exercise.

06:56.533 --> 06:59.784
- Oh, l see.
- What's the matter?

06:59.955 --> 07:01.663
- l can't believe you.
- What?

07:01.832 --> 07:05.284
- You were totally coming on to him.
- l was not. l was being sociable.

07:05.504 --> 07:08.589
l don't think that Tim was able to make
that subtle distinction.

07:08.801 --> 07:11.637
Look, Kelly, it's not like l gave him
my phone number or anything.

07:11.805 --> 07:13.881
And besides, l told him
that l had a boyfriend.

07:14.058 --> 07:15.433
Only because l was standing there.

07:15.853 --> 07:17.680
Kelly, l'm here to exercise.

07:18.648 --> 07:20.392
Nothing more.

07:23.781 --> 07:26.487
- Sarah.
- l know you.

07:26.660 --> 07:28.035
- Dylan.
- l know.

07:28.204 --> 07:33.413
- How you doing?
- l'm okay. How you doing?

07:34.421 --> 07:36.414
Well, better than the last time
you saw me.

07:36.591 --> 07:38.999
Yeah, you were pretty wasted.

07:39.178 --> 07:41.551
Yeah, l'm pretty good at that.

07:42.391 --> 07:46.853
So you ever see that guy Brandon?

07:47.023 --> 07:51.770
Yeah, yeah, all the time, you know,
at school and then some.

07:51.947 --> 07:53.322
How's he doing?

07:53.532 --> 07:57.032
Oh, he's good.
Never really got into surfing, though.

07:57.204 --> 07:59.956
l mean, you can take the boy
out of Minnesota,

08:00.125 --> 08:02.581
but you can't take
the Minnesota out of the boy.

08:03.046 --> 08:04.588
He saved my life.

08:04.757 --> 08:06.382
Him and his sister...

08:06.885 --> 08:08.260
Brenda.

08:09.472 --> 08:11.595
Yeah, Brenda.

08:12.518 --> 08:14.262
They should have just let me drown.

08:15.189 --> 08:17.016
lt's not their style.

08:19.111 --> 08:22.066
- So are you still surfing?
- Oh, all the time.

08:22.282 --> 08:24.608
Yeah, l was actually thinking about
getting back into it.

08:24.786 --> 08:28.832
Maybe the salt water will help me
get this mush out of my brain.

08:30.544 --> 08:31.873
The waves are up.

08:32.046 --> 08:35.214
And l'm going out tomorrow morning,
if you wanna meet me.

08:35.969 --> 08:41.309
- Yeah, yeah. Maybe l will.
- Be good for you.

08:46.359 --> 08:48.518
Are you sure this is a good idea?

08:48.696 --> 08:51.188
You don't see the bills, Brandon.

08:51.366 --> 08:54.321
Since the remodelling
and this recession thing,

08:54.496 --> 08:56.738
yeah, we got the lunch traffic,
all right,

08:56.916 --> 08:59.704
but our night business
isn't what it used to be.

09:00.796 --> 09:01.994
Who's that?

09:02.173 --> 09:05.258
lf he's got a gun and a mask,
tell him we're closed.

09:09.017 --> 09:10.761
Hey, man, what are you doing here?

09:10.936 --> 09:12.929
l came to bring you greetings
from an old friend.

09:13.106 --> 09:14.137
Really? Who's that?

09:14.316 --> 09:16.808
You remember surf betty, Sarah?

09:16.987 --> 09:19.110
How could l forget?
l jump-started her lungs.

09:19.282 --> 09:20.990
Yeah, well, she remembers you too.

09:21.159 --> 09:24.244
Well, that's because
l give great mouth-to-mouth.

09:24.623 --> 09:26.248
So how's she doing?

09:26.417 --> 09:28.956
l saw her at an AA meeting.

09:29.129 --> 09:32.047
Of what l remember,
she could use it.

09:32.259 --> 09:34.501
Hey, what, am l doing this alone
or what?

09:35.388 --> 09:37.013
Don't ask.

09:44.902 --> 09:46.527
- Dylan.
- Hi.

09:46.696 --> 09:49.532
- lt's not too late, is it?
- No, of course not.

09:50.118 --> 09:52.610
- How was your class?
- Oh, you know.

09:52.788 --> 09:56.657
A lot of lonely, sweaty people
without a date on a Friday night.

09:57.170 --> 09:59.578
- How was your meeting?
- Oh, it was fine.

09:59.757 --> 10:03.092
- l got something to show you.
- What?

10:03.262 --> 10:05.884
Ninety days sobriety, Bren.

10:06.392 --> 10:09.596
Dylan, l had no idea.
l'm so proud of you.

10:10.898 --> 10:12.392
l didn't even know about it.

10:13.610 --> 10:15.852
Maybe you should come
to a meeting with me sometime.

10:16.072 --> 10:17.353
l would love to.

10:18.284 --> 10:19.447
How about Sunday?

10:20.328 --> 10:23.199
- Sunday night?
- Yeah.

10:25.169 --> 10:26.663
l don't know,
l might have something.

10:29.717 --> 10:33.169
But l'll just cancel. lt's okay.

10:33.347 --> 10:34.722
Thanks.

10:34.933 --> 10:36.926
So do you wanna come in
for a while?

10:37.103 --> 10:40.354
No, it's getting late
and l gotta get up early in the morning

10:40.566 --> 10:41.895
because the waves are happening

10:42.068 --> 10:44.738
and the shape will probably blow out
in a couple of days.

10:47.117 --> 10:50.072
- Good night, Bren.
- Good night.

11:04.559 --> 11:06.433
l'm glad you made it.

11:07.522 --> 11:09.764
l didn't think you'd show.

11:10.443 --> 11:13.647
lt feels great.
l haven't been here in so long.

11:13.864 --> 11:17.530
Well, we'll go around the point there.
Prettiest swells that you've ever seen.

11:18.705 --> 11:20.532
Thanks, Dylan.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.542
Thanks for getting me out here.

11:51.210 --> 11:52.539
This is what it used to be like

11:52.712 --> 11:55.168
before l had to get drunk
to have a good time.

11:55.383 --> 11:59.252
Man, l used to love to get high
and ride those waves.

11:59.472 --> 12:01.465
Me too.

12:02.101 --> 12:04.723
l started drinking at the beach.

12:04.897 --> 12:07.567
lt's crazy, but it seemed
so natural at the time.

12:07.985 --> 12:10.691
That's what other people don't get,
do they?

12:11.156 --> 12:14.692
No, l guess they don't.

12:17.331 --> 12:21.876
So are you still in school,
or did you graduate?

12:22.297 --> 12:24.255
Neither, l dropped out.

12:24.425 --> 12:26.881
My boyfriend and l--
Ex-boyfriend, that is.

12:27.054 --> 12:30.139
--were sharing a dump
on Calvert Street up in Van Nuys.

12:30.309 --> 12:33.893
And l got a job shampooing hair
in a hair salon.

12:34.064 --> 12:37.351
- That's great.
- No, it isn't.

12:38.612 --> 12:40.735
But l did sign up for beauty school.

12:40.907 --> 12:42.865
And l'm gonna get my licence
to cut hair.

12:43.035 --> 12:45.741
Yeah? You wanna cut my hair?

12:47.292 --> 12:48.407
Now, that'd be a challenge.

12:55.929 --> 12:57.922
Good morning, good morning.

12:58.099 --> 12:59.641
Everyone looking forward to tonight?

12:59.810 --> 13:01.720
Yeah, haven't lived
till you've karaoked, right?

13:01.896 --> 13:04.222
l've talked to the guys at the office,
everyone's coming.

13:04.400 --> 13:08.779
Oh, our friends too. Kelly, Steve,
Donna, David, even Andrea.

13:08.948 --> 13:10.941
Well, it sounds like
the Pit's gonna be packed.

13:11.159 --> 13:13.733
Great. My clients tell me
that the bigger the crowd, the better.

13:13.913 --> 13:16.619
Get people to try karaoke once
and they're hooked.

13:16.793 --> 13:19.201
You're not gonna stand up there
and sing, are you?

13:19.380 --> 13:20.543
Yes, l am.

13:21.383 --> 13:22.414
Don't worry, Mom.

13:22.634 --> 13:23.915
You'll only be humiliated

13:24.095 --> 13:27.050
in front of 1 50 of our closest friends.

13:27.224 --> 13:28.303
Hello.

13:28.476 --> 13:32.475
Yes, she's right here.
Who's calling, please?

13:33.024 --> 13:34.851
Tim Matthews.

13:35.027 --> 13:38.314
- Tell him l'm not home.
- Too late for that.

13:44.875 --> 13:46.785
Tim, hi.

13:48.213 --> 13:50.420
Sure, it's okay.

13:51.218 --> 13:55.299
No, no, you did not make a fool
out of yourself last night.

13:56.141 --> 13:57.719
Who's Tim Matthews?

13:58.228 --> 13:59.806
l don't know.

14:00.022 --> 14:02.977
Oh, l can't, l have other plans.

14:03.485 --> 14:05.443
Well, l'm sorry to disappoint you.

14:06.031 --> 14:07.656
Sounds like she likes him.

14:07.867 --> 14:09.907
All right, well, thanks for calling.

14:10.120 --> 14:13.620
You're very sweet. Bye.

14:19.634 --> 14:21.045
What are you staring at?

14:22.388 --> 14:24.880
- Nothing.
- Nothing at all.

14:32.945 --> 14:35.863
Thanks again, Dylan,
for getting me out here. lt was fun.

14:36.033 --> 14:38.192
Oh, anytime.

14:39.079 --> 14:40.538
Listen,

14:41.791 --> 14:43.831
l was wondering,

14:44.712 --> 14:46.954
you feel like going to the movies
tonight or something?

14:47.883 --> 14:51.419
l can't, l made plans already.

14:52.515 --> 14:55.054
Oh, no sweat,
l'll find something to do.

14:55.227 --> 14:58.395
lt's just not that easy
being by myself these days, you know?

14:58.565 --> 15:00.225
Yeah.

15:00.568 --> 15:02.478
You can always go to a meeting,
you know.

15:02.654 --> 15:03.769
Two days in a row?

15:03.990 --> 15:06.529
Hey, whatever gets you
through the night.

15:11.876 --> 15:12.955
All right, everyone.

15:13.837 --> 15:15.462
Please, l'd like to welcome you

15:15.632 --> 15:17.292
to the debut of karaoke
at the Peach Pit.

15:19.137 --> 15:20.168
All right.

15:23.602 --> 15:28.147
And l would like to invite Jim Walsh
the honour of first at mike.

15:28.358 --> 15:31.110
- Go get them, big guy.
- After all, it was his idea.

15:33.407 --> 15:34.866
Thank you, Nat.

15:35.035 --> 15:36.280
Welcome, everybody.

15:36.495 --> 15:38.654
lt's great to see you all,
thanks for coming out.

15:39.082 --> 15:42.286
For my first number,
l'm gonna do one of my old favourites.

15:42.504 --> 15:46.123
His first number? How many
of these things is he gonna do?

15:46.635 --> 15:47.714
Take it away, Nat.

15:52.936 --> 15:56.223
There she was
Just a-walkin' down the street

15:56.399 --> 15:57.893
Singin', ''Do wah diddy--''

15:58.110 --> 16:01.646
- l do not know that man.
- Come on, Mrs. Walsh, he's great.

16:01.865 --> 16:04.736
Snappin' her fingers
And shufflin' her feet, singin'--

16:04.911 --> 16:07.200
So, what do you think?

16:08.124 --> 16:09.155
He looked good

16:09.376 --> 16:11.369
- She looked fine
- Looked fine

16:11.588 --> 16:15.172
She looked so fine, l blew my mind

16:17.722 --> 16:19.798
Walkin' next to me, singin'--

16:20.017 --> 16:23.185
''Do wah diddy diddy dum diddy do''

16:23.397 --> 16:27.526
Holdin' my hand
Just as natural as can be, singin'--

16:27.736 --> 16:30.857
''Do wah diddy diddy dum diddy--''
Hello.

16:31.074 --> 16:34.325
- We walked on
- To my door

16:34.538 --> 16:36.365
- We walked on to my door
- To my door

16:36.582 --> 16:39.074
- Then we kissed a little more
- Then we kissed a little more

16:48.308 --> 16:50.135
l can't believe even you got up there.

16:50.311 --> 16:53.515
Yeah, l've never seen so many sober
people acting stupid in my whole life.

16:53.690 --> 16:56.442
Listen, l'm hungry.
You want a sandwich or something?

16:57.613 --> 17:00.484
- Boy, times sure have changed.
- What?

17:01.744 --> 17:03.488
Used to be, we'd walk in here

17:03.663 --> 17:06.155
and the first thing on your mind
was definitely not food.

17:06.667 --> 17:09.919
Oh, well, that is definitely
not out of the question.

17:10.089 --> 17:11.500
Come here.

17:15.347 --> 17:17.257
Wait a minute, incoming.

17:17.892 --> 17:20.762
Can't be that important, l just saw
everybody in the world that l know.

17:23.192 --> 17:25.565
Hi, it's me, Sarah.

17:25.737 --> 17:28.063
l hope it's not too late.

17:29.033 --> 17:34.409
But l'm not doing so hot tonight.
ln fact, l need a drink pretty bad.

17:34.583 --> 17:38.962
Call me, please. Bye.

17:39.716 --> 17:41.756
Someone from the programme.

17:42.261 --> 17:43.672
l figured.

17:43.847 --> 17:47.134
lt's supposed to be confidential.
l'm sorry.

17:49.355 --> 17:51.348
Why don't you drive me home?

17:51.983 --> 17:55.104
That way, you can call her
and do what you have to do.

17:55.697 --> 17:58.449
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, it's okay.

18:15.601 --> 18:18.472
- l'm so glad to see you.
- Hey, calm down.

18:18.647 --> 18:21.815
Thanks for coming.
l didn't know who else to call.

18:22.653 --> 18:24.812
- Not a pretty sight, is it?
- He won't leave.

18:24.990 --> 18:28.656
lf he stays, l know l'm gonna take that
bottle out of his hand, drink it myself.

18:28.828 --> 18:31.498
Hey, buddy, time to go home.

18:32.709 --> 18:34.287
Come on.

18:34.462 --> 18:35.743
Who the hell are you?

18:35.922 --> 18:39.506
l'm a friend of Sarah's, and l think
she asked you to leave, right?

18:41.680 --> 18:43.756
Oh, so this is him?

18:44.476 --> 18:46.765
This is why you wanted
to break up so bad.

18:46.938 --> 18:50.225
lt wasn't the booze.
You got another guy.

18:50.401 --> 18:52.228
- That's not true.
- You little slut.

18:52.446 --> 18:53.525
Hey.

18:53.740 --> 18:56.314
l'm real scared of you, tough guy.

18:56.535 --> 18:57.816
Doug, please.

18:58.037 --> 19:00.789
Come on, man, why don't you just
take the bottle? Go somewhere else.

19:00.958 --> 19:03.580
She's made it real clear,
she doesn't wanna see you anymore.

19:03.796 --> 19:07.166
Oh, l get it.
You're the sobriety patrol.

19:07.384 --> 19:09.211
l didn't know
you guys made house calls.

19:09.429 --> 19:11.007
Or is it just for the blonds?

19:11.223 --> 19:15.139
- Come on.
- Hey, l'm going, l'm going.

19:15.897 --> 19:17.724
You can have her.

19:23.449 --> 19:25.407
Oh, God.

19:26.621 --> 19:30.205
- lt's all right.
- Please, please, don't leave.

19:30.376 --> 19:32.868
- Please stay with me.
- All right.

19:33.047 --> 19:34.162
He's gonna come back.

19:34.340 --> 19:36.380
- No, he's not.
- l'm scared, he's gonna come back.

19:36.552 --> 19:41.097
He's not gonna come back, all right?
Not as long as l'm here.

19:47.275 --> 19:48.438
Forget about it, Bren.

19:48.611 --> 19:50.604
Outreach calls
are a part of Dylan's programme.

19:50.781 --> 19:53.866
l know, it was just weird
hearing her voice.

19:54.035 --> 19:56.111
''Hi, Dylan. lt's me, Sarah.

19:56.289 --> 19:57.748
l need you.''

19:58.500 --> 20:01.917
lt's not just like it's any girl,
l know her.

20:02.172 --> 20:03.714
How?

20:04.509 --> 20:07.844
Remember that girl last year
who was surfing drunk?

20:08.014 --> 20:10.506
Yeah, the blond.
l thought her name was Betty.

20:10.684 --> 20:13.354
That's just what they call her,
because she's a surf betty.

20:13.522 --> 20:15.598
Oh, a bimbo.

20:15.775 --> 20:19.691
You know, Dylan didn't even tell me
it was her.

20:19.864 --> 20:22.735
He told Brandon he ran into her.
Not me.

20:22.910 --> 20:24.784
Bren, that doesn't
necessarily mean anything.

20:25.790 --> 20:28.116
l called him
before l went to sleep last night.

20:28.293 --> 20:30.369
- lt was real late.
- And?

20:30.547 --> 20:32.041
He wasn't home, Kel.

20:32.257 --> 20:34.546
And he wasn't there
first thing this morning either.

20:34.719 --> 20:37.840
Brenda, l'm sure there's a simple
explanation. You should just ask him.

20:38.391 --> 20:40.301
l just don't wanna push it, you know?

20:40.519 --> 20:43.093
Besides, l wanna see
if he'll tell me himself.

20:43.273 --> 20:44.436
Yeah, l guess.

20:44.609 --> 20:47.445
l mean, it's not like you've told him
about Tim or anything.

20:47.947 --> 20:51.483
- What does that mean?
- Brenda, you were flirting with him.

20:51.702 --> 20:55.368
Kelly, he's just some guy
who said hello to me in exercise class.

20:55.541 --> 20:56.620
There's nothing to tell.

20:57.961 --> 20:59.621
Okay.

20:59.839 --> 21:02.627
There she was
Just a-walkin' down the street

21:02.802 --> 21:06.219
Singin',
''Do wah diddy diddy dum diddy do''

21:06.390 --> 21:09.142
Jim, please. Give it a rest.

21:09.311 --> 21:10.426
Yeah, Jim.

21:10.605 --> 21:12.931
You guys
just don't have an ear for talent.

21:14.402 --> 21:17.320
Ladies, ladies, ladies,
what is all this?

21:17.490 --> 21:20.575
Exercise class and jogging?
What are you getting in shape for?

21:20.744 --> 21:23.414
That's a good question, Brenda.
What are we getting in shape for?

21:23.582 --> 21:25.076
For ourselves.

21:25.251 --> 21:27.957
Did Dylan happen to call
while we were out?

21:28.756 --> 21:33.336
- No, but Tim called.
- He did?

21:33.555 --> 21:37.424
He's calling you now?
Oh, and there's nothing to tell.

21:37.644 --> 21:40.895
- Kelly.
- l'm sure you'll tell Dylan all about it,

21:41.107 --> 21:42.601
won't you?

21:42.818 --> 21:44.610
He left a number.

21:44.821 --> 21:46.779
Just who is this
Tim character, anyway?

21:47.867 --> 21:50.738
Just some guy
that l met in exercise class.

21:53.208 --> 21:55.830
- A guy who makes you blush.
- Brandon.

21:56.046 --> 21:58.372
Fear not, young sibling.

21:59.217 --> 22:01.127
My lips are sealed.

22:18.620 --> 22:20.280
What's that?

22:22.208 --> 22:25.329
Breakfast in bed. Eggs, toast,

22:25.505 --> 22:28.626
l couldn't find any coffee,
but l think this soda has caffeine in it.

22:28.801 --> 22:31.672
That's great, thanks.

22:31.973 --> 22:34.013
No, thank you.

22:35.686 --> 22:39.732
l don't think l could have slept a wink
if l had to be here by myself.

22:43.823 --> 22:45.982
You look cute in the morning.

22:47.161 --> 22:48.905
Thanks.

22:51.042 --> 22:52.916
Dylan...

23:05.563 --> 23:08.481
- This isn't a good idea.
- But why not?

23:09.527 --> 23:12.363
Look, you know about
the 1 2 steps, right?

23:12.573 --> 23:14.899
Sure, ''AA's 1 2 steps
are a group of principles,

23:15.077 --> 23:19.206
which, if practised as a way of life,
can expel the obsession to drink.''

23:19.416 --> 23:21.326
- Yadda, yadda--
- But there's a 1 3th step,

23:21.503 --> 23:23.995
and that's when people in the
programme start fooling around.

23:24.507 --> 23:25.622
What's wrong with that?

23:25.801 --> 23:27.379
At least you know
you're fooling around

23:27.595 --> 23:29.469
with someone who doesn't drink.

23:29.640 --> 23:33.057
No, no-- Look, l know that
it's hard for you right now.

23:33.228 --> 23:34.259
l know that,

23:34.438 --> 23:38.188
but you just can't go getting involved
with every guy that's nice to you.

23:38.402 --> 23:41.357
l'm not talking about every guy.

23:42.408 --> 23:45.944
l'm talking about you.
l need you, Dylan.

23:46.122 --> 23:50.501
You're in the programme,
you can help me stay sober.

23:51.254 --> 23:53.710
You don't even know me.

23:55.510 --> 23:59.212
You surf and you're sober.
What else do l need to know?

24:01.936 --> 24:04.891
God, l want a drink so bad.

24:05.442 --> 24:08.064
Just forget about
one day at a time, okay?

24:08.237 --> 24:11.572
Try one hour.
Call a sponsor, go to a meeting.

24:11.742 --> 24:14.068
Or take a walk, anything.

24:14.246 --> 24:16.785
Why can't l just have you?

24:17.834 --> 24:20.207
l have a girlfriend.

24:26.222 --> 24:28.714
l should have told you sooner.

24:29.894 --> 24:31.436
l'm sorry.

24:38.865 --> 24:42.033
Dylan, l can't do this by myself.

24:45.291 --> 24:47.331
l'm scared.

24:48.754 --> 24:50.961
l'm so scared.

24:54.680 --> 24:56.388
l'm scared l'm--

24:56.557 --> 24:59.761
l'm just gonna--
l'm gonna slide away.

25:01.523 --> 25:03.979
l'm not gonna let that happen.

25:05.612 --> 25:07.486
l promise.

25:07.698 --> 25:10.272
Go to the meeting tonight, okay?
l'll be there.

25:32.526 --> 25:33.557
Friend Kelly, right?

25:33.736 --> 25:36.310
Hi, Tim. Brenda's not here.

25:36.490 --> 25:39.160
l know. She told me
she wasn't gonna be here.

25:39.328 --> 25:40.870
She said she had other plans.

25:41.706 --> 25:43.248
With her boyfriend.

25:44.085 --> 25:47.918
So? They're not engaged, are they?

25:48.132 --> 25:51.253
- No.
- Well, then, fair game.

25:52.180 --> 25:55.098
- You don't give up, do you?
- l'm relentless.

25:55.267 --> 25:56.927
lt's part of my charm.

26:01.318 --> 26:04.236
Next week, Dylan,
you're bringing the coffee.

26:04.990 --> 26:08.325
And, Phil, you're leading. Great.

26:08.495 --> 26:10.120
All right, see you all then.

26:10.331 --> 26:14.081
And, remember, what do we say?

26:15.255 --> 26:19.468
Keep coming back.
lt works if you work it.

26:19.678 --> 26:21.386
Great, thanks.

26:23.892 --> 26:27.808
- So, what do you think?
- Well, it's different than l expected.

26:27.982 --> 26:31.399
l mean, l thought it would be
depressing or boring or something.

26:31.570 --> 26:32.649
But it wasn't.

26:32.822 --> 26:35.990
lt was kind of intense
and fun at the same time.

26:36.160 --> 26:38.782
Yeah, well, nobody would come
if it was a total drag.

26:38.956 --> 26:42.243
People get really personal, though.
l mean, they talk about everything.

26:42.419 --> 26:43.700
Sex, money.

26:43.880 --> 26:45.707
l thought
they would just talk about drinking.

26:46.467 --> 26:50.252
People need to share their secrets.
lt's a big relief.

26:50.431 --> 26:53.468
You get it off your chest, you know,
it makes it less painful,

26:53.644 --> 26:55.851
and, well, if you're in less pain,
you might not drink.

26:57.816 --> 26:59.975
You didn't have much to say tonight.

27:00.779 --> 27:02.523
Don't you have any secrets?

27:02.740 --> 27:07.819
So l finally get to meet
the much-exalted Brenda Walsh.

27:08.040 --> 27:11.624
- Yup, finally got her to come.
- You mean you finally asked.

27:11.795 --> 27:12.874
l'm Ben.

27:13.047 --> 27:15.254
- My sponsor.
- l know who Ben is.

27:15.425 --> 27:17.050
Dylan's told me a lot about you.

27:17.595 --> 27:19.802
Not as much
as he's told me about you.

27:20.558 --> 27:21.887
l was afraid of that.

27:22.102 --> 27:25.270
Oh, don't worry.
Your secrets are safe with me.

27:25.440 --> 27:27.018
And a roomful of alcoholics.

27:31.949 --> 27:35.449
- Ben, have you seen Sarah?
- No.

27:36.748 --> 27:39.370
- l'm worried about her, man.
- Listen,

27:39.585 --> 27:42.503
you work your programme
and let Sarah work hers.

27:50.643 --> 27:53.479
Your cheatin' heart

27:54.232 --> 27:57.934
Will make you weep

27:58.112 --> 28:00.235
You'll cry and cry

28:00.407 --> 28:03.575
- This is, like, too hip, huh?
- Come on, she's got real talent.

28:03.745 --> 28:05.120
Yeah, yeah.

28:05.289 --> 28:07.448
Someone put her
out of her misery, please.

28:07.626 --> 28:11.126
She's making me nostalgic
for Mr. Walsh.

28:11.340 --> 28:13.298
- Hello, hello.
- Hey, Nat.

28:13.468 --> 28:15.757
So, what did l tell you?
ls this great or what?

28:15.930 --> 28:17.093
l got to admit it.

28:17.265 --> 28:19.057
They are here and they are buying.

28:19.226 --> 28:22.181
- Thank you, pal.
- My pleasure.

28:22.356 --> 28:24.016
l don't know how
to tell you this, honey,

28:24.192 --> 28:25.900
but l feel a song coming on.

28:26.069 --> 28:28.940
Oh, no, honey, not again.

28:32.662 --> 28:36.114
Be-bop-a-lula, she's my baby

28:36.334 --> 28:37.709
Be-bop-a-lula

28:37.878 --> 28:40.548
Hang in there, Mom.
Only three more hours till closing.

28:40.716 --> 28:43.920
Be-bop-a-lula, she's my baby

28:44.096 --> 28:47.846
Be-bop-a-lula, l don't mean maybe

28:48.060 --> 28:50.136
Be-bop-a-lula, she's my baby

28:50.313 --> 28:53.019
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

28:53.192 --> 28:54.817
- This is Tim.
- Hi.

28:55.028 --> 28:56.059
- Hi.
- How you doing?

28:56.238 --> 28:57.436
- Hi.
- Good to meet you.

28:57.615 --> 28:59.109
Hey, Kel, what'll it be?

28:59.326 --> 29:01.652
This is Brandon, Brenda's brother.
This is Tim Matthews.

29:01.830 --> 29:03.111
Oh, hi, Brandon.

29:03.332 --> 29:06.002
- You got a real cute sister.
- Thanks.

29:06.169 --> 29:09.954
- You must be exercise-class Tim.
- l guess l am.

29:10.133 --> 29:14.298
But don't let this incredible physique
fool you, l'm really lousy at it.

29:15.892 --> 29:17.932
Now l know why
you're suddenly so into aerobics.

29:18.103 --> 29:20.226
Not even.
He doesn't even know l exist.

29:20.398 --> 29:24.017
- Yeah, so why is he here?
- He's looking for Brenda.

29:24.195 --> 29:25.855
Brenda? What about Dylan?

29:26.031 --> 29:27.062
l don't know.

29:27.241 --> 29:29.947
l tried to tell him,
but it's just not sinking in.

29:30.121 --> 29:31.152
All right.

29:31.331 --> 29:34.915
Well, don't look now.
Things are about to get interesting.

29:35.086 --> 29:36.664
Yeah

29:36.880 --> 29:39.122
Hoo, boy

29:39.301 --> 29:41.377
Who knew
accountants could be so groovy?

29:41.596 --> 29:42.841
Hey, guys.

29:43.014 --> 29:45.137
Bren, a friend of yours
just showed up.

29:45.309 --> 29:46.590
Who?

29:47.104 --> 29:49.180
Do the laptop, where?

29:49.357 --> 29:51.017
Great.

29:51.235 --> 29:52.694
Brenda.

29:53.989 --> 29:55.104
Who's that?

29:55.825 --> 29:58.399
Just some guy l met
in exercise class.

29:59.997 --> 30:01.195
Excuse me, will you, a minute?

30:02.292 --> 30:03.323
Sure.

30:04.420 --> 30:07.256
Hi. Kelly told me you might be here.

30:07.466 --> 30:10.966
Oh, she did? l'll be sure to thank her.

30:13.350 --> 30:15.390
Tim Matthews, this is Dylan McKay.

30:15.854 --> 30:17.847
- Hi.
- How you doing?

30:18.023 --> 30:20.775
So you guys met at, what,
an aerobics class?

30:21.278 --> 30:22.653
Cardio Funk, actually.

30:22.864 --> 30:24.987
- Really gets the heart rate going.
- Yeah.

30:25.200 --> 30:26.575
Take my pulse, please.

30:28.789 --> 30:33.168
- He's premed.
- Yeah. l gotta make a phone call.

30:33.379 --> 30:35.087
- Now?
- Yeah,

30:35.257 --> 30:37.297
l wanna try Sarah
and see if she's come in yet.

30:37.886 --> 30:38.917
Okay.

30:40.389 --> 30:42.216
l'll be right back.

30:45.063 --> 30:46.344
Hi, honey.

30:46.523 --> 30:49.359
Hi. Tim, this is my mother.

30:49.569 --> 30:50.767
Oh, hi.

30:51.447 --> 30:52.692
Nice to meet you.

30:52.907 --> 30:55.363
And that up there is my father.

30:55.953 --> 30:58.361
Wow, the whole family's
here tonight, huh?

30:58.582 --> 31:02.451
Yes, and unfortunately your father
just can't say no to karaoke.

31:02.630 --> 31:05.466
Well, l know
how to take care of that.

31:05.634 --> 31:08.755
Come on, Brenda.
Let's show them how it's done.

31:14.856 --> 31:17.348
- Wild thing
- Wild thing

31:18.945 --> 31:20.523
You make my heart sing

31:20.739 --> 31:22.981
See?

31:23.160 --> 31:25.200
- You make everything.
- You make everything

31:25.872 --> 31:28.161
Groovy

31:28.960 --> 31:31.416
- Wild thing
- Wild thing

31:31.588 --> 31:33.462
l love this part.

31:34.175 --> 31:38.304
- Wild thing, l think l love you
- Wild thing, l think l love you

31:39.224 --> 31:43.353
But l wanna know for sure

31:43.814 --> 31:46.851
- Come on and hold me tight
- Oh, baby

31:49.114 --> 31:51.440
l love you

31:58.294 --> 32:00.334
l'm sorry, he dragged me up there.

32:00.547 --> 32:05.009
Forget about it. Listen,
l just tried to get ahold of Sarah.

32:05.221 --> 32:06.965
She was really
on the edge last night, Bren.

32:07.140 --> 32:08.171
l'm worried about her.

32:08.350 --> 32:10.177
l think l should go
and see what's going on.

32:10.395 --> 32:12.055
lsn't there anyone else
who can help her?

32:12.231 --> 32:14.639
She's counting on me, Bren.
l can't let her down.

32:15.694 --> 32:16.857
Fine, go.

32:17.864 --> 32:19.442
l'd rather be here with you.

32:19.658 --> 32:21.200
Look, just do what you have to do.

32:21.411 --> 32:25.280
- Bren--
- Dylan, just go, all right? l understand.

32:30.716 --> 32:32.543
Where do you think he's going?

32:32.719 --> 32:34.546
l don't know,
but it must be pretty important,

32:34.722 --> 32:36.549
he's just leaving her there.

32:37.184 --> 32:42.097
Listen, if you need a ride,
l can take you home.

32:48.575 --> 32:50.698
Who the hell is that?

32:50.870 --> 32:53.112
Open the door.

32:56.879 --> 32:59.453
Hi, Dylan.

32:59.633 --> 33:01.756
Who the hell is that?

33:01.969 --> 33:03.463
That's my friend Dylan.

33:05.516 --> 33:08.684
So, Dylan, feel like a beer?

33:08.896 --> 33:10.640
We're just having
a couple ourselves.

33:10.816 --> 33:14.067
Yeah, l can see that.
l can't believe you gave her a drink.

33:14.905 --> 33:17.575
l didn't give her nothing.
She was drunk when l got here.

33:17.784 --> 33:19.658
ls that true? ls it?

33:20.246 --> 33:23.948
Hey, if it's anybody's fault l'm drunk,
it's yours.

33:24.502 --> 33:29.166
l told you l couldn't do it alone,
but you turned your back on me.

33:29.342 --> 33:31.002
What was l supposed to do?

33:31.220 --> 33:33.842
l told you what to do.
You didn't listen to me.

33:34.058 --> 33:35.303
No, you didn't listen to me.

33:37.020 --> 33:39.428
l think you better go now.

33:39.816 --> 33:44.111
Yeah, Mr. Clean, time to go home.

33:44.990 --> 33:47.316
Come with me, Sarah. l'll help you.

33:47.536 --> 33:49.078
She's not going anywhere.

33:49.288 --> 33:50.782
l think that's up to her, isn't it?

33:51.458 --> 33:53.581
l don't think so.

33:56.966 --> 33:57.997
No!

33:58.552 --> 33:59.583
Come on.

34:00.012 --> 34:01.175
Get out.

34:03.600 --> 34:05.225
Get out!

34:10.610 --> 34:13.447
l don't know how Sinatra does it.

34:13.614 --> 34:15.737
Seventy-five
and he still gets up there.

34:15.909 --> 34:18.661
They're still outside, Jim.

34:18.831 --> 34:21.239
So what? He's a nice guy.

34:21.418 --> 34:23.659
Well, what do you think it means?

34:23.838 --> 34:26.755
Honey, they're just talking.

34:26.926 --> 34:29.085
l know,

34:29.554 --> 34:31.928
but what about Dylan?

34:32.434 --> 34:35.471
They're just talking.

34:37.733 --> 34:40.022
Thanks for taking me home.

34:40.195 --> 34:42.900
l'd take you home
any night of the week.

34:43.241 --> 34:44.735
- Tim.
- What?

34:44.909 --> 34:48.446
l know. You have a boyfriend.

34:49.333 --> 34:51.041
l tell you what.

34:51.210 --> 34:52.492
lf you want,

34:52.672 --> 34:55.757
l'll get in my car, l'll drive away
and l'll never look back.

34:55.926 --> 34:58.215
Just say the word.

35:02.060 --> 35:03.768
Well?

35:05.482 --> 35:07.605
l don't want you to do that.

35:16.915 --> 35:18.457
l shouldn't be doing this.

35:25.177 --> 35:27.300
Yes, you should.

35:28.056 --> 35:31.758
Look, l'm sorry, l can't.

35:34.441 --> 35:36.019
l don't mean to lead you on.

35:37.528 --> 35:38.939
You're not.

35:40.574 --> 35:42.448
Well...

35:43.245 --> 35:44.360
Good night, then.

35:45.290 --> 35:47.497
Do me a favour and think about it,
will you, Brenda?

35:48.419 --> 35:49.450
l will.

35:50.506 --> 35:53.543
- Promise?
- l promise.

35:54.887 --> 35:57.129
l like you, Brenda Walsh.

36:09.450 --> 36:11.526
Hey, you coming to school?

36:11.703 --> 36:13.577
No.

36:14.916 --> 36:18.001
Okay. See you.

36:18.212 --> 36:20.004
- Brandon, wait.
- What?

36:22.385 --> 36:26.301
l don't know,
l'm depressed or confused...

36:26.474 --> 36:29.226
l just don't feel like getting up
out of bed.

36:30.480 --> 36:32.806
What's wrong, Bren?

36:33.818 --> 36:36.820
- l kissed him.
- Tim?

36:37.031 --> 36:39.357
He drove me home
and we were outside talking

36:39.535 --> 36:40.994
and it happened.

36:42.080 --> 36:43.824
Well, it was just a kiss, Brenda.

36:44.041 --> 36:47.126
No, it wasn't.
lt was an awesome kiss.

36:47.338 --> 36:49.165
Still, it was just a kiss.

36:49.383 --> 36:51.043
Then why do l feel so guilty?

36:52.762 --> 36:54.838
You know, Bren,
l think we're supposed to kiss

36:55.016 --> 36:57.258
a few different people
before we settle down

36:57.436 --> 36:59.725
with one person
for the rest of our lives.

36:59.898 --> 37:01.772
l know.

37:02.318 --> 37:05.569
l was just so sure that Dylan
and l were meant for each other.

37:06.699 --> 37:09.191
Maybe you are
and maybe you aren't.

37:09.412 --> 37:11.452
lt's just, why did l do it?

37:11.623 --> 37:14.494
What's wrong with me?
l liked it. l liked him.

37:14.669 --> 37:16.461
Bren,

37:16.797 --> 37:19.123
l think that's called
being a human being.

37:23.641 --> 37:28.850
To all the girls l've loved before

37:30.067 --> 37:34.113
Who travelled in and out my door

37:36.034 --> 37:39.285
l'm glad they came along

37:39.622 --> 37:41.615
So who's gonna tell him?

37:41.792 --> 37:43.999
Steve, you tell him.
He'll listen to you.

37:44.170 --> 37:46.922
Oh, somebody's got to,
this is getting painful.

37:47.091 --> 37:49.333
So, ladies and gentlemen,
what will it be?

37:49.511 --> 37:51.587
We gotta talk.

37:52.474 --> 37:54.966
- Sounds serious.
- lt is.

37:56.188 --> 37:59.309
- What's up?
- Would you listen to that?

38:00.068 --> 38:01.978
l owe a lot, l know

38:03.824 --> 38:04.939
lt's pretty rank.

38:06.453 --> 38:07.864
l can't take it anymore.

38:08.080 --> 38:10.654
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
l thought everybody liked karaoke.

38:10.834 --> 38:13.123
Oh, yeah, we do. Once is fine,

38:13.338 --> 38:14.667
but all day long?

38:14.840 --> 38:17.082
lt's kind of like it's not ours anymore,
you know?

38:17.302 --> 38:18.844
l know.

38:19.013 --> 38:24.519
You gotta tell Nat,
it's either karaoke or it's us.

38:24.687 --> 38:27.523
The winds of change
Continue blowing

38:27.733 --> 38:29.940
l'll talk to him.

38:30.112 --> 38:33.564
And they just carry me away

38:34.493 --> 38:38.539
- Nat, we got a little problem.
- What is it?

38:39.125 --> 38:41.913
lt's the karaoke.
l mean, it's fun and everything,

38:42.088 --> 38:44.461
but the Pit just isn't the same.

38:44.633 --> 38:46.875
The people aren't the same.

38:47.053 --> 38:48.713
You're telling me?

38:48.889 --> 38:52.176
l'm glad they came along

38:52.853 --> 38:55.559
My friends are saying they're gonna
boycott unless we do something.

38:55.774 --> 38:58.016
Well, they're right, Brandon.
Karaoke's great,

38:58.194 --> 39:00.353
but the Peach Pit, it's a juke joint.

39:00.573 --> 39:02.447
Always was, always will be.

39:02.617 --> 39:03.862
What about the money?

39:04.829 --> 39:07.202
You kids are the lifeblood
of this place.

39:07.374 --> 39:09.414
l know what side
my bread's buttered.

39:09.628 --> 39:12.796
- Well, l'm glad to hear you say that.
- But you have to do me a favour.

39:12.966 --> 39:16.253
Anything, as long as you can
get Julio to shut up.

39:17.055 --> 39:18.633
Break the news to your dad.

39:18.808 --> 39:23.056
Of all the girls l've loved before

39:25.359 --> 39:27.815
Good, and raise it up.

39:27.988 --> 39:29.946
And down.

39:34.163 --> 39:36.121
All right.

39:41.173 --> 39:43.879
So, what are you guys
doing tonight?

39:45.471 --> 39:49.055
Kelly, can you give me a minute?
l need to talk to Tim.

39:51.772 --> 39:54.976
Okay, lay it on me.

39:57.656 --> 39:58.687
l'm sorry,

39:58.866 --> 40:02.318
but l don't think that we should
be seeing each other.

40:02.538 --> 40:04.198
Why not?

40:04.374 --> 40:05.572
Brenda, you're in high school,

40:05.751 --> 40:07.993
you should be going out
with lots of guys.

40:08.213 --> 40:10.420
l don't want to.

40:10.591 --> 40:12.169
l wanna go out with Dylan.

40:12.385 --> 40:15.303
But the guy just left you
standing there last night.

40:15.473 --> 40:19.768
That's not true.
Dylan wouldn't do that to me.

40:20.689 --> 40:24.605
Someone was in trouble
and they were counting on him.

40:24.987 --> 40:27.479
Dylan's not the type of guy
who would turn his back on someone

40:27.657 --> 40:28.820
he made a promise to.

40:29.034 --> 40:30.778
l'm sorry.

40:30.954 --> 40:33.706
l jumped to conclusions.

40:33.916 --> 40:34.995
lt's okay.

40:36.337 --> 40:40.632
l guess l just really wanted to believe
that Dylan was no good for you.

40:45.725 --> 40:47.718
l just hope he appreciates
what he's got.

40:48.646 --> 40:49.725
Thanks.

40:51.400 --> 40:54.402
Kelly, can you give me a second?
l forgot something in my locker.

40:56.407 --> 40:58.483
- Bye.
- Bye.

41:09.218 --> 41:10.760
She dumped me.

41:10.928 --> 41:13.336
Sorry, l tried to warn you.

41:13.516 --> 41:15.010
What does she see
in that guy, anyway?

41:15.185 --> 41:17.392
l mean, he's not that hot.

41:18.189 --> 41:20.016
Trust me,
they're meant for each other.

41:21.611 --> 41:24.815
So do you have a boyfriend?

41:25.742 --> 41:27.534
No.

41:28.037 --> 41:30.326
Hi, l'm Tim Matthews.

41:30.498 --> 41:33.915
Kelly Taylor. Nice to meet you.

41:38.051 --> 41:40.887
l know the last few days
have been hard on you, Bren.

41:41.097 --> 41:44.182
But that girl Sarah, she needed me.

41:44.936 --> 41:49.065
Dylan, l know who she is.
Brandon told me.

41:49.401 --> 41:52.189
So you understand?

41:52.447 --> 41:54.405
Kind of.

41:55.034 --> 41:58.700
Although l'm not quite sure
why you didn't tell me who she was.

41:58.873 --> 42:01.709
l mean, why did l have to hear it
from Brandon?

42:02.128 --> 42:04.086
l don't know.

42:07.427 --> 42:09.883
Maybe you should think about that.

42:10.056 --> 42:12.844
Well, what about you
and that Cardio Funk guy?

42:13.018 --> 42:14.049
- Dylan--
- No,

42:14.229 --> 42:15.807
maybe you should think
about that, Bren.

42:15.981 --> 42:18.473
At least l was trying
to help someone.

42:19.069 --> 42:22.190
Look, AA is a big part of your life,

42:22.908 --> 42:25.614
but you heard what Ben said.

42:26.329 --> 42:29.035
There is such a thing
as getting too involved.

42:29.209 --> 42:31.535
Yeah, well...

42:33.340 --> 42:35.416
Didn't really look like Sarah
wanted my help.

42:35.593 --> 42:37.966
Not the last time l saw her.

42:38.138 --> 42:41.840
She was curled up
with her boyfriend and a bottle.

42:42.687 --> 42:44.680
l'm sorry.

42:46.233 --> 42:48.903
lt's strange. You know?
l mean, l know the drill.

42:49.071 --> 42:52.073
You can't save someone
who doesn't wanna be saved.

42:52.242 --> 42:55.694
Hell, Bren,
for a long time, l was that person.

42:57.208 --> 43:01.587
But when they're right there
in front of you, drowning--

43:01.756 --> 43:03.416
lt can break your heart.

43:04.134 --> 43:06.174
l know.

43:09.601 --> 43:12.223
Listen, l'm sorry l disappeared
on you last night.

43:14.316 --> 43:16.226
lt's okay, l did a little drifting myself.

43:17.320 --> 43:19.443
Do l need to worry about this guy?

43:20.700 --> 43:23.026
No, not anymore.

43:25.248 --> 43:27.158
Dylan,

43:27.752 --> 43:29.412
l kissed him.

43:32.300 --> 43:33.629
l'm sorry. l feel terrible.

43:33.802 --> 43:35.878
l mean, maybe l'm telling you
so l'll feel better,

43:36.056 --> 43:37.171
l don't know.

43:38.100 --> 43:39.559
lt happens.

43:40.771 --> 43:42.016
Did it happen to you?

43:47.489 --> 43:48.983
Yeah.

43:52.079 --> 43:54.368
What's happening to us?

43:55.542 --> 43:57.416
l don't know.

43:58.713 --> 44:01.419
l wonder what it's like
when you're married 20 years

44:01.593 --> 44:04.429
and somebody else
catches your eye.

44:06.892 --> 44:09.300
l guess, if you're in love,
you're flattered

44:09.479 --> 44:11.306
and you look the other way.

44:14.862 --> 44:17.817
l don't want something like this
to break us up, Bren.

44:19.243 --> 44:21.283
Neither do l.

44:29.133 --> 44:31.625
We're gonna be okay.

44:32.346 --> 44:34.469
Yeah, we are.

44:41.108 --> 44:45.321
Wild thing, l think you move me

44:45.656 --> 44:49.240
But l wanna know for sure

44:50.914 --> 44:52.788
Dad's been driven
underground, huh?

44:52.959 --> 44:55.035
Looks like it.

44:55.212 --> 44:57.170
Well, l tried to be gentle.

44:57.340 --> 44:59.250
l hope he didn't take the news
too hard.

44:59.426 --> 45:02.178
Brandon, your father's a survivor.

45:02.848 --> 45:07.476
You make everything groovy

45:08.356 --> 45:10.978
l guess he'll go down singing.

45:13.489 --> 45:16.111
Wild thing

45:17.327 --> 45:19.783
l think l love you

45:20.305 --> 45:26.170
