00:13.680 --> 00:16.558
[Brokaw in English] US Customs agents
are continuing their intensive search

00:16.641 --> 00:20.061
for an American narcotics agent
who was kidnapped in Guadalajara, Mexico

00:20.145 --> 00:21.312
more than a week ago.

00:21.396 --> 00:25.108
But Mexican officials today
criticized one part of the search:

00:25.191 --> 00:28.862
the detailed inspection of cars
entering the United States from Mexico.

00:28.945 --> 00:31.614
Since Friday,
motorists at the busiest border crossing,

00:31.698 --> 00:35.785
at San Ysidro, near San Diego,
have had to wait up to nine hours.

00:35.869 --> 00:39.080
Customs officials have checked
almost half the cars coming through.

00:39.164 --> 00:42.667
[reporter] For the third straight day,
traffic backed up at border checkpoints,

00:42.751 --> 00:45.962
while customs agents searched vehicles
and questioned motorists,

00:46.046 --> 00:47.922
hunting for any sign
of the kidnapped agent.

00:48.423 --> 00:51.843
But the real focus of American concern
lies south of the border,

00:51.926 --> 00:53.636
in the Mexican city of Guadalajara,

00:53.720 --> 00:57.098
now regarded as a major source
of illegal drug traffic bound for the US.

00:57.182 --> 00:58.391
[TV static]

00:58.475 --> 01:01.436
[female reporter] A broad range
of US officials believe that drug dealers

01:01.519 --> 01:04.230
have corrupted some elements
within the Mexican government.

01:04.314 --> 01:05.315
[TV turns off]

01:07.609 --> 01:09.444
[in Spanish] I hear we need to talk.

01:11.529 --> 01:12.906
Close the door, Andres.

01:17.160 --> 01:19.496
[Rodrigo Amarante's "Tuyo" playing]

02:52.172 --> 02:54.007
[cow moos]

02:55.466 --> 02:56.926
[goat bleating]

03:04.559 --> 03:05.727
[sighs]

03:05.810 --> 03:08.104
[in Spanish]
Your tip says how many are inside?

03:08.188 --> 03:10.398
A dozen, maybe more.

03:11.024 --> 03:12.483
Well-armed.

03:12.567 --> 03:15.278
[in English] If Kiki's in there,
we need to find the attic fast.

03:15.695 --> 03:17.363
Before someone puts a bullet in him.

03:19.073 --> 03:21.701
Okay. Wait for my signal.

03:25.872 --> 03:27.123
[whispers in Spanish] Stay here.

03:27.665 --> 03:28.583
Let's go.

03:31.211 --> 03:33.671
[in English]
Got enough guns to take on a fucking army.

03:39.302 --> 03:41.346
This look like a trafficker spot to you?

03:43.765 --> 03:45.099
We'll know soon enough.

03:46.893 --> 03:49.771
[in Spanish] Let's go, guys. Let's go.

04:04.494 --> 04:05.662

-[in English] Fuck!

04:10.583 --> 04:12.710
[chatter over radio]

04:12.794 --> 04:14.087
[man in Spanish] To the right!

04:14.170 --> 04:16.214
-Move!
-[gunshots]

04:17.882 --> 04:20.385
[gunshots]

04:20.468 --> 04:21.636
[man] Careful!

04:21.719 --> 04:23.137
[in English] Find the attic!

04:23.471 --> 04:25.556

04:35.275 --> 04:36.359
[gunshots]

04:44.784 --> 04:46.411
[man] I found the attic!

04:46.869 --> 04:48.496
I found the attic!

04:49.247 --> 04:51.124
Quickly. This way.

04:52.375 --> 04:54.335
Through this door.

05:02.260 --> 05:03.303
Kiki?

05:04.470 --> 05:05.471
Kiki?

05:09.475 --> 05:10.310
Kiki!

05:42.383 --> 05:45.553
[panting]

05:47.680 --> 05:51.517
[over radio in Spanish]
The medical forensics team...

05:51.893 --> 05:53.770
[man] Here's another one. Come and help.

05:53.853 --> 05:56.564
These people were tied
to Félix Gallardo's operation.

05:56.647 --> 05:58.149
[in English] Oh, they were, huh?

05:58.232 --> 06:00.818
-[in Spanish] It was a good tip.
-Not good enough.

06:00.902 --> 06:02.278
[man 2] Hey!

06:02.362 --> 06:03.863
We found him!

06:14.040 --> 06:14.916
Hey!

06:18.711 --> 06:20.004
[man] Over here, sir.

06:23.633 --> 06:24.759
Agh.

06:28.054 --> 06:30.890
[flies buzzing]

06:36.479 --> 06:38.022
[doorbell rings]

06:40.733 --> 06:43.069
-[baby babbles]
-[chuckles] Yep.

07:00.086 --> 07:01.003
[Jaime] Mika.

07:01.754 --> 07:03.381
[whimpers]

07:03.464 --> 07:04.715
[Jaime in English] I'm sorry.

07:05.800 --> 07:06.717
I'm sorry.

07:07.176 --> 07:09.929
[Mika crying]

07:11.806 --> 07:14.475
[male reporter in English] ...bodies
of US drug agent Enrique Camarena

07:14.559 --> 07:18.187
and Mexican pilot Alfredo Zavala
being loaded in the back of a pickup,

07:18.271 --> 07:21.357
guarded by heavily-armed
Mexican Federal police

07:21.441 --> 07:24.694
for the 70-mile drive
from Zamora to Guadalajara.

07:25.111 --> 07:28.573
The bodies were discovered
early yesterday morning by a farm worker

07:28.656 --> 07:30.241
along a well-traveled road.

07:30.324 --> 07:32.743
They had not been there 12 hours earlier.

07:33.077 --> 07:36.664
The spot they were found
was just 500 yards from a ranch house,

07:36.747 --> 07:40.209
where federal police killed
five members of a family on Saturday

07:40.293 --> 07:44.380
after receiving an anonymous tip
Camarena could be located on the ranch.

07:44.464 --> 07:47.133
Police said the family
was involved in drug trafficking.

07:48.009 --> 07:49.927
Neighbors said it was a massacre.

07:51.846 --> 07:52.680
[in English] Hey.

08:27.089 --> 08:28.424
[sighs]

08:28.966 --> 08:30.176
[inhales]

08:30.259 --> 08:31.469
[exhales]

08:37.642 --> 08:38.643
[whimpers]

08:51.239 --> 08:52.949
[sobs]

09:00.915 --> 09:05.127
How long was he out there...
[sniffles] ...in the dirt?

09:06.254 --> 09:09.006
We're not sure. Not long.

09:17.557 --> 09:20.768
I want to stay here with him
for a little while.

09:21.394 --> 09:22.228
[Jaime] Okay.

09:25.189 --> 09:26.190
[Mika] Jaime.

09:26.274 --> 09:27.275
[Mika sniffles]

09:31.320 --> 09:32.613
You know who did this?

09:34.949 --> 09:36.534
We're going to find out.

09:45.585 --> 09:47.128
[sighs]

09:48.421 --> 09:50.923
[man in English]
Three ribs on the left side, broken.

09:51.007 --> 09:52.842
Right forearm, broken.

09:53.217 --> 09:55.469
Multiple skull and jaw fractures.

09:56.053 --> 09:57.179
Cause of death?

09:58.306 --> 10:00.099
Blow to the right side of the cranium.

10:00.641 --> 10:04.520
Blunt instrument. Tire iron,
crowbar, something of that nature.

10:05.354 --> 10:07.481
[Ed] Any idea where the murder took place?

10:08.024 --> 10:09.233
Hard to say.

10:09.317 --> 10:12.486
All of the clothes Agent Camarena
and Captain Zavala were wearing

10:12.570 --> 10:15.114
have been destroyed by the Mexican police.

10:15.197 --> 10:16.240
[Jack] Destroyed?

10:17.241 --> 10:21.245
And the plastic sheet covering
their bodies at the scene has been lost.

10:23.623 --> 10:26.417
One place he didn't die
is the Bravo property.

10:27.001 --> 10:30.463
Dirt taken from his fingernails
doesn't match soil found at the ranch.

10:33.883 --> 10:36.844
Thank you, Doctor.
Would you give us a minute, please?

10:36.927 --> 10:38.012
Absolutely.

10:39.972 --> 10:41.057
[Gavin clears throat]

10:43.476 --> 10:45.144
[door opens]

10:45.728 --> 10:46.646
[door closes]

10:46.729 --> 10:48.147
This is a fucking cover-up.

10:49.398 --> 10:51.484
[Jaime] And the Bravo raid was bullshit.

10:52.485 --> 10:55.071
If those folks were connected to Félix,
it's news to me.

10:55.154 --> 10:57.239
The only thing we dug up from that raid

10:57.323 --> 11:00.201
was that the father used to be
a state congressman,

11:00.284 --> 11:02.662
was a thorn in the side
of some folks at the PRI.

11:02.745 --> 11:06.207
MFJP says there were automatic weapons
at the ranch? Well, I was there.

11:06.290 --> 11:09.835
-I never saw or heard any.
-Jesus Christ.

11:09.919 --> 11:11.754
Mexico City's trying to put a bow on this,

11:11.837 --> 11:14.298
feed us some horseshit story,
and move on.

11:14.382 --> 11:15.299
Why?

11:15.383 --> 11:17.802
Because they're afraid
of where the truth might lead.

11:21.597 --> 11:23.891
The cartel leaders need
to be brought down.

11:23.974 --> 11:25.309
But they didn't act alone.

11:25.810 --> 11:26.936
They never have.

11:27.311 --> 11:29.230
DFS, cops on their payroll...

11:29.313 --> 11:31.732
Hell, however high this goes
in Mexico City,

11:33.192 --> 11:34.360
they all killed Kiki.

11:42.118 --> 11:43.119
Time for some answers.

11:45.329 --> 11:48.833
Because this bullshit isn't going to fly.
I promise you that.

11:50.501 --> 11:52.169
I want to talk to the Attorney General.

11:54.088 --> 11:55.172
Right now.

11:56.215 --> 11:57.174
Sir.

11:58.175 --> 11:59.385
Good luck with that.

12:03.389 --> 12:06.392
[Don Neto in Spanish]
Fucking rules are changing.

12:07.435 --> 12:11.063
When cops start getting pinched,
maybe rules don't exist.

12:14.024 --> 12:16.819
[Félix]
Not just cops going down...

12:17.820 --> 12:19.947
[Don Neto] Yeah. Fucking Morlet.

12:21.157 --> 12:23.075
[Félix] Didn't stay in custody long...

12:26.287 --> 12:29.331
[Don Neto] Bet the fucker wishes he had.

12:30.249 --> 12:31.083
Morlet.

12:31.792 --> 12:35.045
[Don Neto]
If DFS isn't bulletproof anymore,

12:35.880 --> 12:38.507
you have to ask yourself,
"Who do you think is next?"

12:40.676 --> 12:43.137
Heard from your friend in Mexico City?

12:45.723 --> 12:47.767
Can't even get him on the fucking phone.

12:53.189 --> 12:54.106
[Félix] Cheers.

13:02.990 --> 13:05.075
We need to get out of Guadalajara, Neto.

13:07.495 --> 13:09.497
Strange times.

13:10.998 --> 13:14.168
Fucking government turning on its own.

13:14.960 --> 13:18.130
The men who matter won't be touched.

13:20.049 --> 13:24.261
Well, no one in our business
gets to choose how it ends.

13:26.847 --> 13:27.890
Where will you go?

13:30.267 --> 13:31.685
Probably Sinaloa.

13:31.769 --> 13:32.645
[Don Neto] Hmm.

13:33.103 --> 13:34.939
Like the old days.

13:36.440 --> 13:37.817
Bandit country.

13:40.027 --> 13:42.446
Never thought you'd go back.

13:45.658 --> 13:46.534
You?

13:48.869 --> 13:50.162
Puerto Vallarta.

13:51.080 --> 13:55.334
If this is the end,
I want to see the ocean.

13:55.918 --> 13:57.711
Girls in bikinis.

13:59.505 --> 14:02.675
Take them to the mountains. Safer there.

14:03.634 --> 14:05.719
Why the fuck would I go to the mountains?

14:06.554 --> 14:08.305
Nowhere's safe.

14:09.807 --> 14:11.475
Those days are gone.

14:15.020 --> 14:17.940
We had a good thing with the weed.

14:19.275 --> 14:25.030
And it could have gone forever,
but it wasn't enough for you. [chuckles]

14:32.955 --> 14:34.748
We had to expand.

14:36.709 --> 14:40.296
We had to expand? Really?

14:42.214 --> 14:43.924
I needed to expand?

14:45.301 --> 14:47.428
Rafa needed to expand?

15:03.110 --> 15:04.570
I love you, Skinny.

15:05.821 --> 15:09.408
They're coming for us now,
but you're the one they really want.

15:12.620 --> 15:14.246
Watch your back.

15:17.207 --> 15:21.170
Let's go! Pack your swimsuits.
We're going to the beach.

15:23.255 --> 15:24.089
[sighs]

15:28.260 --> 15:29.929
Stay safe, Neto.

15:32.473 --> 15:33.891
I'll be in touch.

15:36.060 --> 15:37.436
I'll fix this.

15:38.354 --> 15:39.313
Sure.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.232
Maybe you will.

15:46.445 --> 15:48.072
[Don Neto sighs]

15:55.037 --> 15:57.456
Start packing up, Tony. We're leaving.

15:57.539 --> 16:00.709
Go ahead, Braulio. Pack it all up.

16:21.730 --> 16:24.358
[Isabella in Spanish]
It's over. The government's turned on him.

16:24.441 --> 16:26.360
Just a matter of time now.

16:27.903 --> 16:31.365
Don't tell me you're still loyal
to Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo?

16:34.368 --> 16:37.705
Who do you think ordered the cops
to arrest your friend Falcón?

16:38.747 --> 16:41.125
To shoot him in the head?

16:42.126 --> 16:43.585
Félix has the coke.

16:44.545 --> 16:46.422
I brokered the introductions
with the Colombians.

16:46.505 --> 16:47.923
I brought them to Félix.

16:49.883 --> 16:52.720
For a fair price,
I'll do the same for you.

16:54.471 --> 16:59.184
If you don't take control
of the organization, someone else will.

17:01.478 --> 17:02.980
And your end is what?

17:04.064 --> 17:06.150
A seat at the table.

17:07.317 --> 17:10.529
And 20 points off any deal
coming from my introductions.

17:12.197 --> 17:13.532
That's a lot of money.

17:13.615 --> 17:14.700
Yes.

17:15.367 --> 17:16.452
For all of us.

17:20.080 --> 17:21.749
I'll talk to the others.

17:37.139 --> 17:38.640
[in Spanish] What do you think, boss?

17:39.892 --> 17:40.851
It's good.

17:43.145 --> 17:46.440
[Sammy] All right, gentlemen, we're going
to fix this place up to the boss's liking.

17:46.523 --> 17:48.942
Kitchen things in there
and set up the bedrooms.

17:49.485 --> 17:50.527
Get to work.

18:16.261 --> 18:18.097
[chuckles]

18:59.263 --> 19:00.889
[Celis in Spanish] You shouldn't have come

19:00.973 --> 19:02.975
to my home and involved Rodolfo
in all of this.

19:03.058 --> 19:04.017
Dad.

19:04.935 --> 19:08.981
Miguel's not only my godfather,
he's my friend. Yours too.

19:09.064 --> 19:11.483
-It isn't that simple, son.
-What then?

19:12.192 --> 19:14.528
We can't just abandon him for no reason.

19:15.028 --> 19:16.572
[Celis] Let us talk, and I'll call you.

19:16.655 --> 19:18.323
-Dad, I can--
-Let me talk to him!

19:20.784 --> 19:21.785
Okay.

19:27.249 --> 19:28.917
Still seems like a boy to me.

19:29.960 --> 19:32.045
Thinks life ought to be fair.

19:33.213 --> 19:36.049
-He didn't grow up like you and me.
-Thank God for that.

19:38.677 --> 19:40.137
Difficult choice we face as fathers:

19:40.220 --> 19:43.182
do we prepare our children
for the world as it is,

19:44.266 --> 19:45.726
or do we shield them from it?

19:49.771 --> 19:50.981
He'll be okay.

19:52.524 --> 19:53.901
A good man.

19:58.280 --> 19:59.573
You shouldn't be here.

20:01.366 --> 20:02.367
I know.

20:04.870 --> 20:06.371
But I need help.

20:07.706 --> 20:09.041
I just need some time,

20:10.375 --> 20:12.753
until I can make arrangements.

20:13.170 --> 20:17.049
Word's out, Miguel. They've changed
the locks on you. It's over.

20:18.133 --> 20:21.094
-I can pay for your protection.
-Yeah, I know!

20:22.596 --> 20:24.306
But you can't hide forever.

20:26.975 --> 20:28.727
Then I'll leave Mexico.

20:30.771 --> 20:33.982
I'll go to Guatemala, Panama,
wherever. But...

20:34.816 --> 20:37.694
I need time to set it up. I need papers.

20:38.570 --> 20:40.155
A way out.

20:40.822 --> 20:41.657
How much time?

20:42.324 --> 20:43.575
No more than a month.

20:43.659 --> 20:44.660
[chuckles]

20:46.161 --> 20:47.162
One week.

20:48.372 --> 20:52.709
I have a house in the hills,
would go there to hunt.

20:53.752 --> 20:55.963
Five hundred thousand dollars. Up front.

20:56.046 --> 20:57.506
[scoffs]

20:58.507 --> 20:59.925
[Celis] What did you expect?

21:00.509 --> 21:02.511
I hide you, I'm endangering myself.

21:06.098 --> 21:08.100
When you have your things in order,

21:08.892 --> 21:11.103
I'll have some state police
escort you south.

21:12.980 --> 21:14.398
Once you're at the border,

21:16.066 --> 21:18.318
you'll give my people another $500,000.

21:23.115 --> 21:25.242
Then you're on your own.

21:27.035 --> 21:28.412
One week, Miguel.

21:31.957 --> 21:33.458
[sighs]

21:33.709 --> 21:35.419
How did it come to this?

21:40.757 --> 21:41.967
It's my fault.

21:44.136 --> 21:47.306
I'm the fool who trusted the wrong people.

21:51.977 --> 21:54.813
After you leave here,
never contact my son again.

21:56.523 --> 21:57.524
Understood?

22:03.322 --> 22:04.489
Go get the money.

22:15.625 --> 22:16.960
-[Jaime in English] Sir.
-[Ed] Hmm?

22:17.044 --> 22:20.464
Some intel came in from the Mexicans.
Félix has fled Guadalajara.

22:20.547 --> 22:22.382
Most likely returned to Sinaloa.

22:22.466 --> 22:23.425
Credible?

22:23.508 --> 22:24.843
[Jaime] Feels right to me.

22:27.054 --> 22:29.723
[sighs] Comandante Calderoni
has put together a task force.

22:29.806 --> 22:32.142
They're heading out tonight
to continue the search.

22:32.225 --> 22:33.143
And...

22:34.144 --> 22:35.771
I'd like to go along, sir.

22:35.854 --> 22:38.231
-It's a Mexican operation.
-We get our hands on Félix,

22:38.315 --> 22:40.567
son of bitch gives us the whole picture.

22:40.650 --> 22:42.277
From Mexico City on down.

22:43.320 --> 22:46.031
-I understand my role will be limited--
-You're being sent home.

22:48.867 --> 22:49.701
What?

22:49.785 --> 22:52.746
You're being pulled out of Guadalajara,
reassigned to Laredo.

22:52.829 --> 22:55.791
-Wait. Wait. Hang on. Ed--
-Jaime, you lost one of your agents.

22:55.874 --> 22:57.501
You're too emotionally attached.

22:57.834 --> 22:59.419
Camarena's been recovered.

22:59.503 --> 23:03.215
-It's a homicide investigation now.
-Too emotionally attached?

23:03.673 --> 23:06.426
When's the last time you got
more than a couple hours' sleep?

23:10.055 --> 23:11.431
How long you had that on your belt?

23:18.355 --> 23:23.276
My brother was killed
working undercover, 1973.

23:24.611 --> 23:28.198
I know what it is to want justice, Jaime.

23:29.616 --> 23:32.869
I also know I was
the last person capable of getting it.

23:36.832 --> 23:38.542
Calderoni is going to take down Félix.

23:40.419 --> 23:42.421
You're burned out, Jaime. It's time.

23:43.130 --> 23:45.090
Take a couple weeks, tie up loose ends.

23:45.173 --> 23:48.385
Yeah, I am burned out.
Kiki was burned out.

23:48.468 --> 23:50.720
We're all burned out by the end, Ed.

23:51.888 --> 23:55.475
-It's Mexico.
-Sir, I can still contribute.

23:57.060 --> 24:00.272
I'm sorry, Jaime.
The decision's been made.

24:07.779 --> 24:10.574
-[Calderoni in Spanish] Let's go.
-[indistinct chatter]

24:17.789 --> 24:20.417
[Calderoni in English]
At least they started making some arrests.

24:20.500 --> 24:24.921
[chuckles] And every confession pointed
right at Rafa, Don Neto, and Félix.

24:25.380 --> 24:29.009
Just enough dirty cops and DFS
sprinkled in to make it play.

24:29.759 --> 24:31.678
Knowing what goes on
in those interrogation rooms,

24:31.761 --> 24:34.097
I'd put more stock
in a fucking palm reader.

24:35.932 --> 24:37.225
You probably should.

24:41.229 --> 24:43.523
I know by the time
you catch up with Félix,

24:45.066 --> 24:46.693
likely he's not coming back alive.

24:46.776 --> 24:48.695
Look, I get how it works down here.

24:49.821 --> 24:51.573
But I need to know the truth.

24:53.033 --> 24:54.159
Everyone involved.

24:55.327 --> 24:57.954
Who ordered the kidnapping,
what they wanted from Kiki.

24:59.372 --> 25:00.916
How high did it go?

25:03.293 --> 25:05.003
Some dangerous questions.

25:06.046 --> 25:08.882
You'd earn yourself some real credit
up north. I'd see to it.

25:08.965 --> 25:13.595
My father was an oil company executive.
I speak five languages, Jaime.

25:14.137 --> 25:16.640
I don't need a 20
slipped into my shirt pocket.

25:18.725 --> 25:19.976
He was my agent.

25:22.312 --> 25:23.313
My friend.

25:25.357 --> 25:26.942
He deserves justice.

25:28.527 --> 25:29.653
I owe him that.

25:31.655 --> 25:34.366
[man in Spanish] Comandante, we're ready.

25:38.495 --> 25:41.831
[in English]
When I find Félix, he'll talk.

25:42.999 --> 25:44.251
[Calderoni in Spanish] Let's go!

25:49.214 --> 25:50.298
[in Spanish] Proceed.

25:58.348 --> 26:01.059
[Agustín Lara's
"Amor de mis amores" playing]

26:32.507 --> 26:34.259
[in Spanish] Inspect all the rooms.

26:42.767 --> 26:43.685
Braulio!

26:44.311 --> 26:45.270
[Braulio] Sir?

26:45.353 --> 26:47.564
-Check there for a phone that works.
-[Braulio] Yes, sir.

26:48.481 --> 26:50.692
-If not, find one.
-[Braulio] Yes, sir.

27:11.296 --> 27:14.382
[indistinct chatter]

27:17.302 --> 27:20.388
[man in Spanish] We're looking
for this man. Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo.

27:20.472 --> 27:21.765
He's a dangerous criminal.

27:48.917 --> 27:51.419
[man in Spanish] What the fuck
are you guys doing-- [grunts]

27:52.462 --> 27:53.463
[grunting]

27:53.546 --> 27:56.424
If I come back tomorrow
and you don't have information for me,

27:56.841 --> 27:58.093
the same happens.

27:59.010 --> 28:01.721
I'll keep breaking your shit,
until you do.

28:23.493 --> 28:25.245
[gagging]

28:32.585 --> 28:33.920
[knock on door]

28:34.003 --> 28:35.422
[man in Spanish] You okay, boss?

28:38.883 --> 28:41.344
Yeah. All good.

29:03.783 --> 29:04.909
[exhales]

29:09.748 --> 29:14.085
[in Spanish] Félix is fucking done.
We need to meet, talk.

29:15.253 --> 29:16.880
I have a place in Ensenada.

29:19.257 --> 29:20.925
It's time to change things up.

29:23.136 --> 29:24.053
Okay.

29:25.764 --> 29:27.766
[sighs]

29:28.266 --> 29:31.686
[man on TV speaking Spanish]

29:49.662 --> 29:51.164
Going for a walk, Tony.

29:51.247 --> 29:52.499
I'll take Braulio.

30:42.882 --> 30:44.759
Want to buy eggs, sir?

31:39.230 --> 31:42.275
[noise from TV]

32:04.213 --> 32:05.924
[in Spanish] Four hours in a hood.

32:06.925 --> 32:08.468
Thought we were friends.

32:14.349 --> 32:15.934
[Félix grunts]

32:19.520 --> 32:20.563
As requested.

32:25.485 --> 32:27.070
These should do the trick for you.

32:28.821 --> 32:33.743
Don't wait long.
Those IDs won't be worth much soon.

32:35.244 --> 32:38.081
Word is, DFS's being shut down.

32:39.082 --> 32:40.750
Already started firing men.

32:42.877 --> 32:44.337
Fucking madness, right?

32:45.630 --> 32:47.382
Who could've seen it coming?

32:49.926 --> 32:51.386
Where will you go?

32:55.640 --> 32:56.891
South.

33:05.024 --> 33:06.526
Any trouble getting them?

33:07.026 --> 33:08.027
Hmm.

33:08.111 --> 33:09.570
[zips bag]

33:09.654 --> 33:12.657
He who asks for the heavens
better be ready to pay.

33:14.075 --> 33:17.996
The DFS is dismantled. I need a new home.

33:21.207 --> 33:26.546
They'll close it, and before long,
open another. They'll make up a new name.

33:28.256 --> 33:30.591
Hire the same men back.

33:32.010 --> 33:37.473
Times like this, who can be sure?
I need to consider my next move.

33:39.183 --> 33:40.643
You know the answer, Azul.

33:42.228 --> 33:43.730
Switch sides.

33:45.440 --> 33:47.859
You'll always have a future
with my organization.

33:48.943 --> 33:49.819
Do you, though?

33:53.322 --> 33:54.407
Do I what?

33:55.783 --> 33:57.660
There's a meeting in Ensenada.

33:58.327 --> 34:01.789
Whatever's left of your cartel
won't be yours much longer.

34:11.799 --> 34:14.844
[in Spanish] It's me, Governor.
I'm ready to go.

34:14.927 --> 34:18.973
I'll send men in the morning
to escort you, Miguel. Good luck.

34:19.932 --> 34:20.892
Sounds good.

34:22.018 --> 34:23.936
Thank you, Governor.

34:25.146 --> 34:26.105
Goodbye.

34:36.032 --> 34:38.409
[overlapping chatter]

34:42.497 --> 34:44.248
[in Spanish] We got a phone call, sir.

34:44.916 --> 34:48.795
-How do you know he's there, Governor?
-I just do. Let's leave it at that.

34:49.629 --> 34:55.176
Félix has a dozen gunmen with him.
Couple Jalisco cops, too.

34:56.177 --> 34:57.970
But they won't give you any trouble.

34:58.805 --> 35:01.307
They should stay in position
until we get there.

35:01.766 --> 35:03.726
I can send
some more police with you, as backup.

35:03.810 --> 35:05.770
Not necessary.

35:06.312 --> 35:09.273
Good luck, Commander.
Glad I could be of service.

35:10.900 --> 35:12.610
Fuck your handshake, Governor.

35:13.361 --> 35:15.279
You're a bigger dirtbag than any of them.

35:31.796 --> 35:33.798
[bell tolling]

36:02.160 --> 36:03.161
Tony!

36:08.374 --> 36:10.042
[Félix in Spanish] These go in my car.

36:37.570 --> 36:39.113
[gunfire]

36:42.658 --> 36:45.077
[in English] Félix, move! Go! Move, move!

36:45.661 --> 36:46.662
Go! Move!

37:01.802 --> 37:02.720
Tony!

37:05.848 --> 37:07.767
[gunshots]

37:08.809 --> 37:11.229
[overlapping yelling]

37:15.900 --> 37:17.151
Go! Move!

37:20.446 --> 37:21.447
[grunts]

37:31.958 --> 37:33.793
[in Spanish]
Drop it! Motherfucker, drop it!

37:33.876 --> 37:38.589
-Stop, motherfucker! Turn around!
-I can pay you!

37:38.673 --> 37:41.968
On your knees.

37:42.051 --> 37:43.261
Okay, okay.

37:43.344 --> 37:45.680
Hands on your head.

37:46.514 --> 37:49.141
I have some money there,
let's make a deal.

37:50.017 --> 37:51.269
Fuck your deal.

37:51.852 --> 37:53.354
You can go slowly.

37:54.146 --> 37:56.816
After you've felt pain you can't imagine.

37:58.109 --> 37:59.402
Or you can die clean.

37:59.860 --> 38:01.529
With a bullet.

38:01.612 --> 38:03.447
The price of that bullet is you talking.

38:05.032 --> 38:06.325
Tell me everything.

38:10.454 --> 38:11.956
I have the tapes.

38:15.918 --> 38:19.672
There's seven tapes
from Agent Camarena's interrogation.

38:21.048 --> 38:22.425
In two of them,

38:22.800 --> 38:26.387
he's asked about names of politicians
involved with traffickers.

38:28.806 --> 38:31.100
They're the names of important men,
Commander.

38:31.434 --> 38:34.312
Men like your boss,
the Minister of Defense.

38:34.395 --> 38:37.857
I paid them millions
and now they've turned on me.

38:42.903 --> 38:46.532
Those men sitting in Mexico City
might be done with me,

38:51.495 --> 38:53.414
but I'm not done with them.

38:55.708 --> 38:56.876
So go ahead.

38:58.336 --> 39:01.255
Shoot me
and tomorrow those names are released.

39:02.631 --> 39:05.051
But save a bullet for yourself.

39:05.509 --> 39:07.470
'Cause the system doesn't like heroes.

39:10.306 --> 39:12.892
Or better yet,
I hold onto those two tapes...

39:15.436 --> 39:17.063
the ones with the names.

39:18.647 --> 39:20.733
But the rest I can give to you.

39:22.902 --> 39:25.905
That's enough to give
the Americans someone.

39:29.950 --> 39:31.077
Think about it.

39:31.160 --> 39:33.162
You get to protect your bosses...

39:37.041 --> 39:40.252
and walk out of here
two million dollars richer.

40:01.023 --> 40:02.691

40:08.114 --> 40:09.281
[Sammy] Hey, gentlemen.

40:09.865 --> 40:13.119
We need some more onions, cilantro,
and cigarettes from the store.

40:14.662 --> 40:15.496
[chuckles]

40:15.579 --> 40:17.331
I'm talking to you, assholes!

40:18.624 --> 40:19.708
You do it.

40:21.419 --> 40:22.461
Dickhead.

40:27.716 --> 40:31.387
Fermin, I need you to run
to the store again. I forgot--

40:33.389 --> 40:34.223
They found us!

How'd they find us?

[in Spanish] Can I help you, miss?

45:06.745 --> 45:08.247
Miguel Félix Gallardo.

45:09.665 --> 45:10.999
He still live here?

45:13.460 --> 45:16.755
We don't have any guests by that name.

45:17.673 --> 45:18.757
Excuse me.

45:45.909 --> 45:48.454
[in Spanish] We should start by saying,
we're all sorry to hear

45:48.537 --> 45:49.997
about the arrest of Don Neto.

45:51.623 --> 45:53.709
Rafa, Neto, Félix...

45:55.002 --> 45:56.920
the men who started this are all gone.

45:58.505 --> 46:01.383
But, with all due respect,
it was never about them.

46:02.926 --> 46:05.721

as the plazas it's made of,

and can move their product
through each other's territory.

46:21.695 --> 46:26.241
The only thing that'll change is
the extra money left on the table. For us.

46:28.494 --> 46:29.453
What is this?

46:31.705 --> 46:32.873
Opportunity.

46:34.875 --> 46:38.128
Why work for someone else
when we can work for ourselves?

46:40.297 --> 46:41.840
What about the cops?

46:42.174 --> 46:44.718
Money buys protection.
Nothing changes that.

46:44.802 --> 46:50.098
But I'm not paying every asshole
who flashes a badge on my doorstep.

46:52.059 --> 46:57.356

I'll arrange new protection.

47:38.188 --> 47:39.940
-[Félix] Take them.
-[soldier] Yes, sir.

47:40.023 --> 47:41.441

47:44.027 --> 47:45.237
[Félix] Stand up, Palma.

47:45.737 --> 47:46.864
Come here, Chapo.

47:49.533 --> 47:50.617

48:07.426 --> 48:09.261
Take a seat.

48:11.054 --> 48:12.139
Go grab a seat.

48:29.907 --> 48:30.991

48:32.993 --> 48:34.161
You look lovely.

48:37.456 --> 48:38.957
Aren't you gonna say hi?

48:48.091 --> 48:49.468
It's so good to see you.

48:52.012 --> 48:55.265
But if you'd excuse us,
there's business to discuss.

49:17.287 --> 49:20.540
You can see my issues with the government
have been resolved.

49:24.419 --> 49:26.296
After a period of misunderstanding...

49:28.924 --> 49:30.717
I've secured their cooperation.

49:30.801 --> 49:33.136
They're my partners again.

49:35.263 --> 49:38.266
Which, of course,
I'm glad to share with you.

49:42.104 --> 49:43.981
That's what old friends are for, right?

49:46.984 --> 49:51.071
Remember when all this began,
bringing together plazas to sell weed?

49:51.488 --> 49:53.740
We were so small.

49:54.866 --> 49:56.034
But...

49:56.827 --> 50:00.956
we were trying something new,
doing things no one had ever done.

50:02.791 --> 50:04.376
And we grew fast.

50:05.919 --> 50:10.549
Along the way, we lost good men.

50:13.010 --> 50:14.845
Neto. Rafa.

50:17.681 --> 50:19.683
I'll carry each in my heart, always.

50:21.727 --> 50:23.645
We shouldn't forget them.

50:24.312 --> 50:26.982
Or the lessons they can teach...

50:28.025 --> 50:30.027
about what happens when we lose our way,

50:31.028 --> 50:32.696
let our minds wander,

50:34.448 --> 50:36.116
when we start fucking up...

50:37.993 --> 50:39.578

50:45.917 --> 50:47.544
They called us "La Familia."

50:48.211 --> 50:50.589
Sure, 'cause we started so small.

50:51.715 --> 50:54.676
And today, with the arrangements
I've made with the government,

50:56.219 --> 50:59.723
I'm more powerful than any trafficker
in the history of Mexico.

51:05.479 --> 51:07.355
Today, we've become "La Federación."

51:10.233 --> 51:12.069
And you all are welcome.

51:14.071 --> 51:15.822
Thank you for your trust.

51:20.202 --> 51:21.495
That's all then.

51:22.245 --> 51:23.580
Oh, wait one second.

51:24.539 --> 51:25.916
Benjamín...

51:26.374 --> 51:28.335
you wanted to say something, right?

51:31.046 --> 51:32.047
No.

51:33.048 --> 51:34.049
Okay.

51:35.217 --> 51:36.551
You can go now, gentlemen.

52:01.576 --> 52:03.578
Too bad what happened to my uncle.

52:05.872 --> 52:06.957
It is.

52:09.584 --> 52:11.044
We'll miss him.

52:14.923 --> 52:16.883
We'll miss him a lot.

53:13.607 --> 53:15.358
[Félix in Spanish] I know you.

53:20.197 --> 53:22.032
You yelled at me in the street.

53:30.498 --> 53:31.499
Yeah.

53:43.220 --> 53:45.263
How long have you been on me?

53:46.473 --> 53:47.474
A while.

53:48.934 --> 53:50.101
Long time.

53:51.436 --> 53:53.104
At the border. That was you, too.

Young boys.

54:13.375 --> 54:15.252
You shouldn't be down here then.

54:16.836 --> 54:18.171
This isn't your country.

54:19.005 --> 54:20.382
I was born in Baja.

54:22.217 --> 54:23.635
I'm Mexican.

54:24.761 --> 54:27.806
You're too smart to believe that.

54:39.150 --> 54:41.987
They keep asking about men in Mexico City.

54:44.197 --> 54:45.740
Your partners' names.

54:48.952 --> 54:50.120
I can help you.

54:52.122 --> 54:53.206
Help me?

54:54.249 --> 54:55.667
When they flip on you.

54:58.920 --> 55:01.256
You're too smart not to see that.

55:02.841 --> 55:05.135
You're not calling the shots here.

55:08.680 --> 55:10.390
What does that tell you?

55:13.310 --> 55:14.728
Let me go home.

Okay.

1:07:01.726 --> 1:07:03.310
-Kenny.
-Walt!

1:07:03.394 --> 1:07:05.479
-[in English] Nice digs, man.
-Hell, yeah, for sure.

1:07:05.563 --> 1:07:07.523
Four stars. Only the best for you, buddy.

1:07:07.606 --> 1:07:08.691
Good to see you guys.

1:07:09.066 --> 1:07:10.735
How-- How'd it go?

1:07:10.818 --> 1:07:13.738
No problems. Traffic was a bitch
coming out of Pendleton.

1:07:26.000 --> 1:07:27.334
[Kenny] What do you think?

1:07:30.129 --> 1:07:32.423
I think, "Fuck...

1:07:33.841 --> 1:07:35.092
that's a lot of fucking guns."

1:07:44.852 --> 1:07:48.856
Learn it, memorize it,
and then burn this shit.

1:07:49.648 --> 1:07:50.608
Understood?

1:07:51.400 --> 1:07:54.028
Time to cross some names
off this fucking list, boys.

1:07:59.950 --> 1:08:02.661
[Walt in English]
Didn't matter if we'd ever met him or not.

1:08:03.579 --> 1:08:05.664
Kiki Camarena was one of us.

1:08:06.248 --> 1:08:07.333
He was ours.

1:08:08.292 --> 1:08:11.337
And when he was killed,
we knew we were in a war.

1:08:12.922 --> 1:08:14.757
Now it was our turn.

1:08:15.382 --> 1:08:17.885
Pretty soon, they were going to know...

1:08:18.469 --> 1:08:20.012
they were in one too.
