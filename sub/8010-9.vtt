WEBVTT

00:04.661 --> 00:06.361
Hey, what are you doing here?

00:06.363 --> 00:08.529
I'm just here to pick up my
turkey day donation box.

00:08.531 --> 00:10.295
Yeah, what's the name
of this organization

00:10.320 --> 00:11.566
- again?
- Needy Families in Need.

00:11.568 --> 00:14.469
Such a vague charity name.
It all feels very sketchy.

00:14.471 --> 00:16.403
Oh, Allison, there's no
organization more reputable

00:16.405 --> 00:18.372
than Families in Need with Neediness.

00:18.374 --> 00:21.275
- That is not the name you just said.
- MARV: We are officially

00:21.277 --> 00:23.644
closed for the Thanksgiving holiday.

00:23.646 --> 00:25.913
- (whoops)
- Everyone have a great weekend.

00:25.915 --> 00:28.949
I've got to start prepping a feast.
Why is she always here?

00:28.951 --> 00:31.152
Just grabbing the Thanksgiving
donation box.

00:31.154 --> 00:33.253
Sounds sketchy, but
I got bigger problems.

00:33.255 --> 00:34.521
I got last-minute shopping to do,

00:34.523 --> 00:35.922
turkey to brine, sweet potatoes to peel,

00:35.924 --> 00:37.391
cranberries to soak.

00:37.393 --> 00:39.125
Please don't go nuts about Thanksgiving.

00:39.127 --> 00:40.960
We are going to like whatever you make.

00:40.962 --> 00:42.796
Although, the cranberry
sauce was a little chewy last year.

00:42.798 --> 00:44.298
I didn't know how to zest an orange.

00:44.300 --> 00:45.965
I think I just ripped up the peel.

00:45.967 --> 00:47.401
Your mom was always the chef.

00:47.403 --> 00:49.769
I was drinking, watching
football and drinking.

00:49.771 --> 00:51.325
Okay, at least let
Brad and me do the

00:51.350 --> 00:52.839
- shopping.
- Actually, that'd be great.

00:52.841 --> 00:55.074
Hey, if I can just chime in,
sweet potato-wise,

00:55.076 --> 00:58.144
I'm marshmallow
intolerant, which brings us to

00:58.146 --> 01:00.113
the hot, blonde elephant in the room.

01:00.115 --> 01:01.514
Um, I have yet to receive

01:01.516 --> 01:03.416
my formal invite to Thanksgiving dinner.

01:03.418 --> 01:05.751
Want to let her down
gently, or can I do it my way?

01:05.753 --> 01:07.886
Um, Amy, I'm sorry if
I wasn't clear before,

01:07.888 --> 01:09.555
but Thanksgiving's just gonna be...

01:09.557 --> 01:11.957
Family only, no tenants
or... let's just say it... Amys.

01:11.959 --> 01:13.726
(chuckling): All right?

01:13.728 --> 01:16.829
Your dad seems to be on the fence
about me at Thanksgiving.

01:16.831 --> 01:18.631
Honestly, if it's
anything like last year,

01:18.633 --> 01:20.165
you're probably better off missing it.

01:20.167 --> 01:21.264
First one without Mom.

01:21.265 --> 01:21.934
- Yeah.
- Oh.

01:21.936 --> 01:24.602
Dad distracted himself with
shopping and cooking.

01:24.604 --> 01:26.571
He did all of these crazy preparations,

01:26.573 --> 01:28.307
and then the second we sat down...

01:28.309 --> 01:30.442
- He lost it.
- Yeah. And then you lost it.

01:30.444 --> 01:31.764
That dog show gets me every time.

01:31.765 --> 01:33.611
Little Pekingese came out of
nowhere to win toy group.

01:33.613 --> 01:35.180
Yeah, no transference there at all.

01:35.182 --> 01:36.748
How'd you hold up?

01:36.750 --> 01:39.617
Oh, I was sad, but, you
know, I held it together.

01:39.619 --> 01:40.620
She was a rock.

01:40.621 --> 01:42.165
Bet she was a rock.

01:42.167 --> 01:43.535
You're always a
rock, aren't you, Allison?

01:43.536 --> 01:45.657
Emotionally, physically.
Look at those abs.

01:45.659 --> 01:47.525
Thank you for noticing.
Please don't touch me.

01:47.527 --> 01:48.161
All right.

01:48.186 --> 01:50.062
I just hope this
year's better, you know?

01:50.063 --> 01:52.096
I can't see my two favorite
guys go through that again.

01:52.098 --> 01:54.098
Not gonna happen. Pekingese retired.

01:54.100 --> 01:57.768
Hip dysplasia.

01:57.770 --> 02:00.171
Just the holidays are
coming, and I feel like

02:00.173 --> 02:02.039
my dad is headed for another breakdown.

02:02.041 --> 02:03.875
And Thanksgiving... I mean, it...

02:03.877 --> 02:05.028
Everything about it is an

02:05.053 --> 02:06.777
- emotional land mine.
- Oh, I hear you.

02:06.779 --> 02:09.847
The tradition, the food, the
highly-restricted guest list.

02:09.848 --> 02:12.249
Yeah, but it's unavoidable. I
mean, what are you gonna do?

02:12.251 --> 02:14.084
Who says? Why don't you blow the lid

02:14.086 --> 02:15.552
off a traditional Thanksgiving?

02:15.554 --> 02:16.854
Invite who you want,

02:16.856 --> 02:18.789
eat what you want, invite who you want.

02:18.791 --> 02:19.433
Make it fun.

02:19.458 --> 02:21.358
You know, that's
actually not a bad idea.

02:21.360 --> 02:23.694
- We could call it “Funsgiving.”
- Oh, I don't think

02:23.696 --> 02:26.162
you have to slap a label on
it, especially that one.

02:26.164 --> 02:28.631
It's awesome. We do
steaks instead of turkey.

02:28.633 --> 02:31.167
Maybe we all pitch in for a
grill that I keep afterwards.

02:31.169 --> 02:32.568
We could even have it at my house.

02:32.570 --> 02:34.037
You know, fewer memories for Dad.

02:34.039 --> 02:36.039
Yeah, at our house. Fewer
memories for Marv.

02:36.041 --> 02:38.210
And we can distract him with
some really fun activities,

02:38.212 --> 02:40.610
because that's what Funsgiving
is all about.

02:40.612 --> 02:42.478
Sounds like we need a high-end gas grill.

02:42.480 --> 02:44.580
Let's not cheap out. There's
a place right next door.

02:44.582 --> 02:46.215
Go nuts.

02:46.217 --> 02:48.183
Uh, did you just steal my credit card?

02:48.185 --> 02:50.520
You're obviously going to
have to learn the hard way

02:50.522 --> 02:52.221
to zip up your purse!

02:52.223 --> 02:55.591
This might be a very expensive
lesson for you.

02:55.593 --> 02:58.861
You know what's so great
about this idea?

02:58.863 --> 03:02.531
- Your mom loves it.
- What?

03:02.533 --> 03:04.776
You know, I'm an angel. I can
talk to the other side.

03:04.778 --> 03:07.236
Yeah. I'm going to stop you right
there because we are treading

03:07.238 --> 03:09.905
- in super offensive territory.
- I'm sorry. Shh. Uh-huh.

03:09.907 --> 03:13.475
Uh-huh. She's saying,
“Hit the triangle”"

03:13.477 --> 03:15.844
But what does she mean by triangle?

03:15.846 --> 03:18.580
- Pyramids? Where are there pyramids?
- Stop it.

03:18.582 --> 03:21.382
The Luxor Hotel. Your
mom wants us to go to Vegas.

03:21.384 --> 03:23.017
Please stop talking about my mother.

03:23.019 --> 03:25.119
I'm sorry, honey. It's
so close to the holidays.

03:25.121 --> 03:26.621
It's inappropriate, yeah.

03:26.623 --> 03:28.757
I don't know why she called.

03:28.759 --> 03:31.192
Since we're going non-traditional
all the way,

03:31.194 --> 03:33.227
- maybe we could include...
- Yeah, you still can't come.

03:33.229 --> 03:36.364
I'm sorry, but this is
all about making my dad happy,

03:36.366 --> 03:37.295
- and...
- And?

03:37.449 --> 03:38.211
You do not...

03:38.212 --> 03:40.401
- make my dad happy.
- I hear you.

03:40.403 --> 03:43.004
Invite contingent on winning over Marv.

03:43.006 --> 03:45.373
Yeah, see, every time
you say, “I hear you,”

03:45.375 --> 03:47.708
you then make it painfully
clear you did not.

03:47.710 --> 03:49.310
Roger that.

03:54.383 --> 03:56.149
Ma'am? Ma'am?

03:56.151 --> 03:58.786
It's okay. I'm with Feeds For Needs.

04:03.826 --> 04:05.826
Marv, you're better than this!

04:05.828 --> 04:08.195
BRAD: Dad, drop the rolling pin!

04:08.197 --> 04:09.926
- This is a kidnapping.
- Thanksgiving's been

04:09.951 --> 04:11.531
canceled and replaced
with Funsgiving.

04:11.533 --> 04:14.101
- Not on board with the name.
- You don't need to label it.

04:14.103 --> 04:15.935
Amy, get out of the
liquor cabinet. Brad, why are you

04:15.937 --> 04:17.536
- filming this?
- 'Cause I'm the family documentarian.

04:17.539 --> 04:18.904
I'm calling this one Zero Dark Turkey.

04:18.906 --> 04:20.307
Now that's how you name something.

04:20.309 --> 04:21.708
Dang it. Forgot to hit “record”"

04:21.709 --> 04:22.842
Everybody out. We got to do it again.

04:22.844 --> 04:24.143
Brad, put the camera down.

04:24.286 --> 04:25.243
Somebody tell me what the hell's

04:25.268 --> 04:26.379
- going on here.
- You are done cooking.

04:26.381 --> 04:27.814
We are going for drinks at Forties.

04:27.816 --> 04:29.181
The fun starts now.

04:29.183 --> 04:30.449
The fun's already begun.

04:30.451 --> 04:32.284
How can you not see that? I'm brining.

04:32.286 --> 04:34.787
I'm peeling, I'm soaking, I'm dicing.

04:34.789 --> 04:37.490
I'm miserable. I can't
get these fingers apart.

04:37.492 --> 04:39.558
Dad, the stress is not good for you.

04:39.560 --> 04:40.959
Let's get you something that is.

04:40.961 --> 04:43.429
Alcohol. Wow. And I'm a doctor.

04:43.431 --> 04:45.097
Yeah, no, I give in. I can't do this.

04:45.099 --> 04:46.365
- I'm in.
- Yeah.

04:46.367 --> 04:47.699
I don't want this.

04:47.701 --> 04:48.753
Oh!

04:48.906 --> 04:52.704
Well, this kidnapping went
way smoother than my last one.

04:58.914 --> 05:00.486
Funsgiving... it's not gonna be like one

05:00.487 --> 05:02.809
of your other themed parties, is it?

05:02.811 --> 05:04.778
Where a murder mystery breaks
out at some point?

05:04.780 --> 05:06.713
No.

05:06.715 --> 05:09.349
But there is gonna be a Wheel of Fun.

05:09.351 --> 05:12.619
With lots of fun activities on it.

05:14.156 --> 05:16.790
- Okay, oh for two.
- BRAD: All right.

05:16.792 --> 05:18.391
It's time for me to find
out which one of these girls

05:18.393 --> 05:20.093
is gonna give me all ten of her digits.

05:20.095 --> 05:22.729
Area codes are a
fact of life now, people.

05:22.731 --> 05:24.130
Hmm.

05:24.132 --> 05:25.731
Who wants a MacManus?

05:25.733 --> 05:28.134
- That's my favorite Scotch.
- I know.

05:28.136 --> 05:29.869
And I also know

05:29.871 --> 05:32.505
that you are a fan of the juice box.

05:32.507 --> 05:34.207
It's the perfect single serving.

05:34.209 --> 05:35.741
Stay the hell out of my cabinets.

05:35.743 --> 05:39.179
Oh, Marv, let's start over.

05:44.018 --> 05:47.352
Thought you'd meet me
halfway on that one.

05:47.354 --> 05:49.989
♪ ♪

05:52.760 --> 05:55.227
- Hi. I'm Brad.
- Hey.

05:55.229 --> 05:57.963
- Oh. I'm Brandi.
- Brandi.

05:57.965 --> 06:00.699
Can't, uh... can't spell “Brandi”
without “Brad”"

06:00.701 --> 06:02.501
- Well...
- Then... a couple more letters.

06:02.503 --> 06:04.203
Oh. You're a good speller.

06:04.205 --> 06:06.105
Well, I've won a lot of bees.

06:06.107 --> 06:07.672
(laughter) Okay.

06:07.674 --> 06:10.041
- So, what do you do?
- Uh, I'm a flight attendant.

06:10.043 --> 06:12.244
That's insane.
I'm-I'm an airline enthusiast.

06:12.246 --> 06:15.080
Well, I love enthusiasm.

06:15.082 --> 06:17.882
You seem like an Airbus A320 girl?

06:17.884 --> 06:19.718
Oh, my God, well, that's my plane.

06:19.720 --> 06:21.119
I knew you were a busser.

06:21.121 --> 06:22.721
They're good birds, good birds.

06:22.723 --> 06:25.456
Stay out of aisle 25, of course, right?

06:25.458 --> 06:27.158
Those seats don't recline as much.

06:27.160 --> 06:29.193
- Right.
- You're laughing

06:29.195 --> 06:30.970
with me, right, not at me?
Just want to make sure.

06:30.995 --> 06:31.562
Mm, yeah.

06:31.564 --> 06:34.098
Okay, do Liam Neeson,
but you just get one word.

06:34.100 --> 06:35.899
- One word? Um...
- Yes.

06:35.901 --> 06:39.036
- (like Neeson): Bananers.
- (laughing)

06:39.038 --> 06:41.139
I'm gonna hit the
head. Cheer up, will you?

06:41.141 --> 06:43.107
ALLISON: Wow.

06:43.109 --> 06:44.808
You two seem to be getting along.

06:44.810 --> 06:46.744
Well, we're not all that different
once you get past

06:46.746 --> 06:48.211
the height and the hair, and the fact

06:48.213 --> 06:49.513
that I'm a celestial being.

06:49.515 --> 06:51.281
BRAD: Big bro

06:51.283 --> 06:53.050
- just crushed it, got digits.
- (gasps)

06:53.052 --> 06:54.918
Who's the lucky lady? I got
to give the sister sign-off.

06:54.920 --> 06:57.154
She went in the other room.
She's awesome. Super cute.

06:57.156 --> 06:58.588
Flight attendant in town for the night?

06:58.590 --> 07:00.658
What the hell are you
doing here? Close that deal.

07:00.660 --> 07:02.159
No. You don't want to have sex

07:02.161 --> 07:04.093
with someone the
night before Thanksgiving.

07:04.095 --> 07:07.096
Wake up on a stranger's couch
on a major holiday? Not happening.

07:07.098 --> 07:09.299
She's coming back in town
next week. I'm leaving right now.

07:09.301 --> 07:11.334
Sounds like you
fumbled on the one-yard line.

07:11.336 --> 07:13.002
No. I'm taking a
knee on the one-yard line.

07:13.004 --> 07:15.038
Then next weekend, boom,
explode into the end zone.

07:15.040 --> 07:16.484
- Gross.
- I'm not gonna apologize.

07:16.509 --> 07:17.674
That was a perfect analogy.

07:17.676 --> 07:19.441
Okay, I think I'm ready to
go. How about you guys?

07:19.443 --> 07:21.811
Leaving already? I thought we
were just getting started.

07:21.813 --> 07:23.197
Yeah, I'll hang with you, Marv.

07:23.339 --> 07:25.015
Just the two of us without
any witnesses?

07:25.016 --> 07:28.051
What the hell. I've already
been kidnapped once tonight.

07:28.053 --> 07:30.887
Marv's in! Come on, one
more round. Is Brad in?

07:30.889 --> 07:32.922
No, can't do it. I
got to get out of here.

07:32.924 --> 07:34.072
I'm working a slow roll strategy for

07:34.097 --> 07:35.158
- the holidays.
- ALLISON: I got to go

07:35.160 --> 07:37.793
prep for more fun, which is almost
as fun as the fun itself.

07:37.795 --> 07:39.295
Okay.

07:39.297 --> 07:44.132
Oh, Marv, your
daughter is a delightful nerd.

07:45.736 --> 07:48.237
Oh, look at you checking
out that beauty.

07:48.239 --> 07:50.472
I see you like your women the
same age as your Scotch.

07:50.474 --> 07:52.607
- 15.
- (laughing): 15.

07:52.609 --> 07:53.942
- That'd be super illegal.
- Yeah.

07:53.944 --> 07:55.376
Why don't you go talk to her?

07:55.378 --> 07:57.713
It's been a while since
I've been out there.

07:57.715 --> 07:59.414
Ellen and I got married
straight out of college.

07:59.416 --> 08:00.882
Well, the game's the same.

08:00.884 --> 08:03.185
You're still five feet of thunder.

08:03.187 --> 08:03.821
Five, six.

08:03.846 --> 08:05.722
Ah, don't quibble about the inch count.

08:05.723 --> 08:07.889
That's a short man's game.
You're better than that.

08:07.891 --> 08:10.091
- I don't know.
- Oh, come on. It's just flirting.

08:10.093 --> 08:11.892
You flirt with me all the time.

08:11.894 --> 08:13.828
I'm not sure you're
clear on our dynamic,

08:13.830 --> 08:15.863
but I appreciate you
trying to cheer me up.

08:15.865 --> 08:18.566
How much do you appreciate
it? Did you appreciate it enough

08:18.568 --> 08:21.469
to let a certain someone
attend a certain upcoming,

08:21.471 --> 08:23.204
poorly-named family event?

08:23.206 --> 08:25.873
- You can come.
- Amy's in!

08:27.076 --> 08:29.276
Amy, you've been in my room forever,

08:29.278 --> 08:31.311
and that makes me very concerned.

08:31.313 --> 08:33.914
Well, I couldn't find your speakers,
but I did find this.

08:33.916 --> 08:36.183
Look, it's a box of all
your old home movies.

08:36.184 --> 08:38.953
Pop the corn. It's show time.

08:38.955 --> 08:40.354
Write it down as a potential activity

08:40.356 --> 08:42.020
and put it in the Fun Bowl.

08:42.023 --> 08:44.324
It's just a bowl,
Allison. It doesn't need a name.

08:44.326 --> 08:46.326
Hey, when's my new bestie,
Marv, getting here?

08:46.351 --> 08:46.993
Yeah.

08:46.995 --> 08:48.928
Just to triple
confirm... you are invited?

08:48.930 --> 08:50.897
Because I never got a text from him.

08:50.899 --> 08:53.533
I grow on people,
Allison, like a delightful mildew.

08:53.535 --> 08:55.935
Actually, I have no idea where he is,

08:55.937 --> 08:58.238
which is weird, because he's never late.

08:58.240 --> 09:00.539
(gasps) Oh, no, you don't
think he's sitting at home

09:00.541 --> 09:02.441
reliving last
year's emotional breakdown?

09:02.443 --> 09:04.543
Thanksgiving is so hard for him.

09:04.545 --> 09:06.646
Yes, so hard. For him.

09:06.648 --> 09:08.181
Oh, and his phone is going
straight to voice mail.

09:08.183 --> 09:09.582
We have to go check on him.

09:09.584 --> 09:10.950
How was he at the end of the night?

09:10.952 --> 09:12.418
I don't know. I left early.

09:12.420 --> 09:14.420
Had a little rendezvous
with the Oyster King.

09:14.422 --> 09:16.756
Who, by the way, is in
a post-coital slumber

09:16.758 --> 09:18.223
back in my guesthouse.

09:18.225 --> 09:20.626
- Is it cool if he's my plus one?
- No.

09:20.628 --> 09:24.163
Okay, I hear you. I'll text
him that that is a maybe.

09:24.165 --> 09:26.198
Dad?

09:26.200 --> 09:29.067
Dad?

09:30.738 --> 09:32.171
Is everything okay?

09:32.173 --> 09:34.139
Why are you smiling so hard?

09:34.141 --> 09:36.008
Hey, Marv, where do
you keep your cinnamon?

09:36.010 --> 09:38.110
Oh. Hi.

09:44.001 --> 09:46.474
Look at you! I feel I'm owed some credit

09:46.476 --> 09:49.110
for brokering the deal. I
want ten percent of that smile.

09:49.112 --> 09:50.745
It's a good time to ask me for things.

09:50.747 --> 09:52.913
In fact, anything you
see, really, just take it.

09:52.915 --> 09:56.183
- Hi. I'm Marv's daughter, Allison.
- Oh.

09:56.185 --> 09:58.886
Brandi. Hi. I recognize you
from the photo in your dad's...

09:58.888 --> 10:00.754
bed... room.

10:00.756 --> 10:02.156
MARV: Allison,

10:02.158 --> 10:04.558
I'm so very sorry that
you had to see this.

10:04.560 --> 10:06.560
Well, you know, you
can't start Thanksgiving

10:06.562 --> 10:08.261
any more untraditional than this, huh?

10:08.263 --> 10:10.063
Marvin Gardens.

10:10.065 --> 10:11.565
Right.

10:11.567 --> 10:13.166
Uh, Dad, could you slip into something

10:13.168 --> 10:14.401
a little less comfortable?

10:14.403 --> 10:15.636
Of course.

10:15.638 --> 10:17.437
Oh...

10:17.439 --> 10:19.006
- (chuckles)
- (phone rings)

10:20.275 --> 10:22.009
Hello?

10:22.011 --> 10:24.310
So what did happen
at the bar last night?

10:24.312 --> 10:25.945
- Did you hook my dad up?
- No, no, no.

10:25.947 --> 10:27.547
I swear I just wanted him to flirt.

10:27.549 --> 10:30.050
I had no idea he'd close the deal.

10:30.052 --> 10:31.451
Oh, Allison, a real

10:31.453 --> 10:33.786
underdog story played out last night.

10:33.788 --> 10:36.456
You know what? It's all gonna
be fine. It's gonna be just fine.

10:36.458 --> 10:38.791
- It's gonna be fine, fine, fine.
- That's a lot of fines.

10:38.793 --> 10:40.293
Yeah, 'cause I'm good. I'm
really good. I'm good, good, good.

10:40.295 --> 10:42.127
- Take it easy.
- Allison, again,

10:42.129 --> 10:44.196
I am so sorry that you had to...

10:44.198 --> 10:46.632
- walk in on all this.
- No, Dad,

10:46.634 --> 10:48.834
the whole point of today
was for you to have a good time.

10:48.836 --> 10:50.803
I'm actually really happy for you.

10:50.805 --> 10:53.973
But not as happy as you are
for you. You look like the Joker.

10:53.975 --> 10:55.207
I can't stop smiling.

10:55.209 --> 10:57.142
- It actually hurts.
- (chuckles)

10:57.144 --> 10:59.911
Well, Chicago's snowed-in.
My flight got canceled.

10:59.913 --> 11:02.013
So I guess I have nowhere
to go for Thanksgiving.

11:02.015 --> 11:03.915
How horrible for you.

11:05.052 --> 11:07.052
Brandi, would you like to come

11:07.054 --> 11:09.221
to my house for Thanksgiving?

11:10.891 --> 11:12.357
Really?

11:12.359 --> 11:13.358
Does this make sense?

11:13.360 --> 11:15.326
It feels ill-fated.

11:15.328 --> 11:16.327
'Cause it's gonna be great.

11:16.329 --> 11:17.495
Yeah. It's gonna be

11:17.497 --> 11:18.463
great, great, great.

11:18.465 --> 11:19.631
Okay, sure. Why not?

11:19.633 --> 11:20.832
- Great.
- Brandi's in.

11:20.834 --> 11:22.467
- So great.
- (whoops)

11:22.469 --> 11:25.369
Okay, I've got everyone's favorite apps.

11:25.371 --> 11:27.371
Got pigs in a blanket
for Brad. Lo mein for Dad.

11:27.373 --> 11:29.240
Cigarillos for Amy,

11:29.242 --> 11:30.208
not to be smoked on the property.

11:30.210 --> 11:31.842
And, Brandi, I really just took

11:31.844 --> 11:34.312
a stab with this. But jelly beans?

11:34.314 --> 11:36.981
I don't mean to insult
you. It's really just all I had.

11:36.983 --> 11:38.870
Oh, there's nothing insulting

11:38.872 --> 11:39.917
about jelly beans. Allison,

11:39.919 --> 11:41.685
come here for just a sec.

11:41.687 --> 11:45.623
Did you see Brandi's necklace?

11:47.159 --> 11:48.926
It's a triangle. It's what
your mom was going on

11:48.928 --> 11:51.028
and on about. She
said she wanted your dad

11:51.030 --> 11:53.396
to hit the triangle.

11:53.398 --> 11:56.000
Brandi's the triangle.

11:56.002 --> 11:58.736
But then why would your
mom want your dad

11:58.738 --> 12:00.938
to hook up with Brandi?

12:00.940 --> 12:04.141
- Hi.
- Hey!

12:04.943 --> 12:06.743
Brandi?

12:06.745 --> 12:09.279
- Hey...
- Brad. Th-This is...

12:09.281 --> 12:11.814
I was gonna call you. I don't
have to now 'cause you're sitting

12:11.816 --> 12:13.517
on my sister's couch. Did you guys talk

12:13.519 --> 12:15.519
after I... No?

12:15.521 --> 12:17.720
Amy? Did you guys
do this to surprise me?

12:17.722 --> 12:19.389
Do a Thanksgiving surprise?

12:19.391 --> 12:21.190
That's insane. That would never be done.

12:21.192 --> 12:22.892
My dad has a huge grin on his...

12:22.894 --> 12:25.728
face. Oh, no.

12:25.730 --> 12:27.630
Wait, Marv is your dad?

12:27.632 --> 12:30.099
This is just spectacular.

12:30.101 --> 12:31.167
You two know each other.

12:31.169 --> 12:33.803
Yeah. She was my digits.

12:33.805 --> 12:35.071
(quietly): She was
your flight attendant?

12:35.073 --> 12:36.405
(quietly): Yes.

12:36.407 --> 12:37.473
I think she can hear us.

12:37.475 --> 12:38.907
And I think she can understand.

12:38.909 --> 12:40.942
I'm sorry. I thought
we were on the same page,

12:40.944 --> 12:44.046
doing the old... the old
Thanksgiving Eve slow roll.

12:44.048 --> 12:45.881
I don't know what that is.

12:45.883 --> 12:47.516
I fumbled on the one.

12:47.518 --> 12:49.418
I had no idea you two knew each other.

12:49.420 --> 12:51.353
I feel terrible.

12:51.355 --> 12:54.455
That's not coming through
that big smile of yours.

12:54.457 --> 12:58.694
ALLISON: Okay! It's Fun
Bowl time! (clapping)

12:58.696 --> 13:00.095
Fun Bowl. There's a
bowl of fun on the table.

13:00.097 --> 13:01.396
- Yeah.
- Yeah. And, uh,

13:01.398 --> 13:02.664
Brandi, since, uh, you seem

13:02.666 --> 13:03.832
to be in the middle of everything

13:03.834 --> 13:05.200
and the guest of honor,

13:05.202 --> 13:06.301
why don't you go ahead and fish

13:06.303 --> 13:07.502
a fun activity out of that bowl.

13:07.504 --> 13:09.537
- Great. Okay.
- Yeah.

13:09.539 --> 13:11.072
- Um...
- What do we got?

13:11.074 --> 13:13.208
- Basketball.
- Hey, pick another one.

13:13.210 --> 13:14.775
- No.
- Can't do that. We got five.

13:14.777 --> 13:16.344
- Those would be uneven teams.
- You know,

13:16.346 --> 13:18.112
I happen to have, in my own domicile,

13:18.114 --> 13:20.848
uh, a certain
gentleman, uh, who has moves

13:20.850 --> 13:23.518
as smooth as the late Michael Jordan.

13:23.520 --> 13:24.885
Jordan's still alive.

13:24.887 --> 13:26.386
Fine. The Oyster King can play.

13:26.388 --> 13:28.189
Just have him meet us at the park.

13:28.191 --> 13:30.825
♪ ♪

13:37.734 --> 13:39.366
Okay.

13:39.368 --> 13:40.868
Amy, Brad, you're on my team.

13:40.870 --> 13:42.869
Brandi, Dad, and...

13:42.871 --> 13:44.338
the Oyster King on the other.

13:44.340 --> 13:45.606
Am I really calling him that?

13:45.608 --> 13:46.707
He's earned it.

13:46.709 --> 13:47.708
Actually, I can't play.

13:47.710 --> 13:49.610
You know, I only have heels, so...

13:49.612 --> 13:52.178
Well, that seems like
a 15-minute-ago thought there,

13:52.180 --> 13:53.213
- Brandi.
- Hey,

13:53.215 --> 13:54.414
just play in your bare feet.

13:54.416 --> 13:55.649
- Great.
- All right?

13:55.651 --> 13:56.316
Let's do this.

13:56.318 --> 13:57.217
- Yeah!
- (whoops)

13:57.219 --> 13:58.218
Need some help with those?

13:58.220 --> 13:59.285
I'm good.

13:59.287 --> 14:01.121
Oh, look.

14:01.123 --> 14:02.488
Me against Dad. Like always.

14:02.490 --> 14:04.958
- Since when?
- Since always!

14:04.960 --> 14:07.560
All right, see if you can steal
this like you stole Brandi, huh?

14:07.562 --> 14:09.528
Are you kidding me?

14:09.530 --> 14:10.489
- Yeah!
- Come on, Brad.

14:10.514 --> 14:11.831
Get your head in the game.

14:11.833 --> 14:13.499
This is supposed to be fun, guys!

14:13.501 --> 14:18.271
This is fun. He's playing
an erogenous zone defense.

14:18.273 --> 14:19.104
Brad, I'm open!

14:23.311 --> 14:24.810
(distorted): No!

14:24.812 --> 14:27.413
Oh! Ooh. Ow. Ow! Oh, my foot!

14:27.415 --> 14:29.515
Let me take a look. I'm a doctor.

14:29.517 --> 14:30.816
I didn't know that.

14:30.818 --> 14:32.684
Did you not even talk to her?

14:32.686 --> 14:34.953
Yeah, it's not good. We should
get her over to the ER.

14:34.955 --> 14:36.922
- Or...
- Funsgiving is over.

14:36.924 --> 14:38.523
It was over when he
slept with his son's date.

14:38.525 --> 14:41.160
I didn't know! It was Amy's fault!

14:41.162 --> 14:43.628
She was the one that
was wingman-ing me.

14:43.630 --> 14:45.597
Well, I wouldn't have had
to if you had simply invited me

14:45.599 --> 14:48.033
- to Thanksgiving in the first place.
- Hey, guys,

14:48.035 --> 14:48.966
my foot's really hurting.

14:48.968 --> 14:51.035
Brandi, let 'em work it out.

14:51.037 --> 14:52.904
I just wanted it to be
us, just family, you know?

14:52.906 --> 14:54.572
- A traditional Thanksgiving.
- And I was

14:54.574 --> 14:56.541
only trying to make it
different for you guys this year.

14:56.543 --> 14:58.543
Congratulations. It's different.

14:58.545 --> 15:00.412
- This year we're going to the ER.
- Here we go.

15:00.414 --> 15:02.347
Easy does it.

15:02.349 --> 15:04.015
Easy, easy, easy, easy. Got you,
got you, Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

15:04.017 --> 15:05.183
- Got you, got you. I got you.
- Ah.

15:05.185 --> 15:07.919
- I got you.
- AMY: Yeah.

15:09.388 --> 15:10.888
At least one of you stay. The teams

15:10.890 --> 15:12.890
are uneven now.

15:12.892 --> 15:15.726
Fine. Funsgiving's over.

15:15.728 --> 15:17.494
Aw. Come on. Come here.

15:17.496 --> 15:19.297
- Don't even. No.
- No. Come on, honey.

15:24.127 --> 15:26.293
Allison, what are you doing?

15:26.295 --> 15:29.163
Cleaning up this giant failure.
No one even ate the appetizers.

15:29.165 --> 15:30.328
We're gonna be having lo mein

15:30.353 --> 15:31.732
- sandwiches for weeks.
- You've been

15:31.734 --> 15:33.500
running around keeping
yourself busy all day.

15:33.502 --> 15:35.568
Let me do this. Go.
Get out of here. (sighs)

15:35.570 --> 15:39.172
Yeah. Yeah. Maybe I'll do that.

15:41.576 --> 15:43.352
I'll just let 'em soak.

15:43.473 --> 15:45.912
So what's the protocol for how
long we have to stay here

15:45.914 --> 15:47.892
- for your one-night stand?
- Well, we

15:47.917 --> 15:49.983
at least have to fill out this form.

15:49.984 --> 15:53.286
Last name...

15:53.288 --> 15:55.988
We'll circle back to that.

15:55.990 --> 15:58.591
Address...

15:58.593 --> 16:00.360
I think she said her hub was Chicago.

16:00.362 --> 16:03.696
She's from Deerfield. How
do you not know that?

16:03.698 --> 16:06.132
She's 33. She has mild asthma.

16:06.134 --> 16:08.300
Her favorite color's purple.
There's no box for that.

16:08.302 --> 16:11.137
- It's like you two are strangers.
- We are.

16:11.139 --> 16:14.006
We had a few drinks.
We went home together.

16:14.008 --> 16:15.975
And for a few moments, I actually forgot

16:15.977 --> 16:18.077
that it was Thanksgiving and the holidays

16:18.079 --> 16:19.812
and all the sadness.

16:21.482 --> 16:25.817
So I'm sorry if I ruined
your chances with...

16:25.819 --> 16:28.787
Brandi.

16:28.789 --> 16:31.156
I know. I'm sorry I'm being...

16:31.158 --> 16:33.925
It's okay. I-I... I'm
actually glad that you're...

16:33.927 --> 16:36.261
- you're out there. Grossed out by it.
- Right?

16:36.263 --> 16:37.896
- But glad.
- Well...

16:37.898 --> 16:39.330
Just have to get used to
the fact that we're competing

16:39.332 --> 16:40.498
over the same women.

16:40.500 --> 16:41.566
It's not a competition.

16:41.568 --> 16:43.301
You get one-zip out of your head.

16:43.303 --> 16:45.536
All right? Get it out of there.

16:45.538 --> 16:49.540
Okay. It looks like
Brandi did break her foot,

16:49.542 --> 16:51.576
and it turns out
she's gonna need surgery.

16:51.578 --> 16:53.511
We're gonna keep her overnight.

16:53.513 --> 16:55.046
- Okay. Thank you, Doc.
- Thank you.

16:57.783 --> 17:00.518
So what's the protocol
for staying overnight?

17:00.520 --> 17:01.719
Do we both...

17:01.721 --> 17:03.053
- Maybe neither?
- Yeah.

17:03.055 --> 17:04.722
She's gonna be out all night.

17:04.723 --> 17:06.015
Just come back in the

17:06.040 --> 17:07.491
- morning. Just...
- Yeah.

17:07.492 --> 17:09.992
Yeah, maybe bring
coffee. I'll bring bagels.

17:09.994 --> 17:12.494
Come on, Dad. She can't eat gluten.

17:12.497 --> 17:15.065
(crickets chirping)

17:16.868 --> 17:20.069
Hit the triangle.

17:26.145 --> 17:29.812
Honey, are you okay?

17:29.814 --> 17:33.283
I heard about the big breakup.

17:33.285 --> 17:35.685
I'm fine. Fine, fine, fine.

17:35.687 --> 17:39.222
Really? I know how much you
loved New Kids on the Block.

17:39.224 --> 17:40.923
And they were a...

17:40.925 --> 17:43.560
great band.

17:44.963 --> 17:48.131
It's okay to let it out.

17:48.133 --> 17:50.599
Brad, why are you filming this?!

17:50.601 --> 17:52.434
I'm the family documentarian!

17:52.436 --> 17:54.637
Get out of my room!

17:58.276 --> 18:00.843
I really miss the New Kids on the Block.

18:00.845 --> 18:02.844
They were a...

18:02.846 --> 18:05.581
great band?

18:05.583 --> 18:09.251
Oh, kiddo.

18:09.253 --> 18:12.421
I am so not hangin' tough, Dad.

18:12.423 --> 18:14.222
Is that, uh, one of their songs?

18:14.224 --> 18:17.159
(sniffles) It was their biggest hit.

18:19.763 --> 18:23.464
I miss Mom, too.

18:23.466 --> 18:27.869
Wow. Shocker. She did not clean up.

18:27.871 --> 18:30.105
Are you okay? Did you
just watch that dog show?

18:30.107 --> 18:31.406
Do not tell me what happened.

18:31.408 --> 18:32.740
I actually am okay.

18:32.742 --> 18:34.709
- But I'm starving.
- Yeah,

18:34.711 --> 18:37.111
me, too. I just wrapped lo
mein around cocktail weenies.

18:37.113 --> 18:38.378
Times are bad.

18:38.380 --> 18:40.280
What the...

18:40.282 --> 18:44.318
- Is Amy having a party out there?
- Hmm?

18:53.729 --> 18:55.784
- Hello, hoopsters.
- Hey. We didn't

18:55.809 --> 18:58.031
expect you to make up so quickly.

18:58.033 --> 19:02.401
I had the Oyster King create
us a beautiful feast.

19:02.403 --> 19:04.170
Get your jeans on, Clark.

19:04.172 --> 19:06.806
Uh, I think I left those in the garden.

19:06.808 --> 19:07.974
Mm.

19:07.976 --> 19:09.255
AMY: Welcome to

19:09.259 --> 19:12.411
my inclusive Thanksgiving dinner.

19:12.413 --> 19:14.580
Where nobody has to
beg for a formal invite

19:14.582 --> 19:17.282
or have quick, unsatisfying
sex with Marv.

19:17.284 --> 19:19.257
I'm just guessing,
but it's been a long time.

19:19.402 --> 19:21.207
It probably wasn't very good for her.

19:21.322 --> 19:24.623
So, all this food you've
been collecting has been for us?

19:24.625 --> 19:26.258
We were the needy family?

19:26.260 --> 19:27.926
Wow. That is so self-centered.

19:27.928 --> 19:29.728
No, you people are Beverly Hills doctors.

19:29.730 --> 19:33.999
This food is compliments
of Dr. Allison Fuller.

19:34.001 --> 19:35.433
Honey, you have got

19:35.435 --> 19:37.836
to learn to zip up your purse.

19:38.672 --> 19:41.573
Happy Thanksgiving, one and all.

19:41.575 --> 19:44.175
Happy Thanksgiving, Amy.

19:45.445 --> 19:47.746
Please stop snooping through my stuff.

19:47.748 --> 19:50.982
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

19:50.984 --> 19:55.152
This meal before you was made with love

19:55.154 --> 19:56.918
and without pants.

19:57.043 --> 19:59.491
- Let's eat!
