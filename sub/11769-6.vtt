A Division of TIME WARNER
ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY, L.P.

00:27.033 --> 00:29.300

HOW ARE WE DOING ?

00:32.100 --> 00:33.533

FEELING ALRIGHT,

00:34.567 --> 00:35.700
NO UNCOMFORTABLE
SENSATIONS ?

00:35.733 --> 00:36.833

00:36.867 --> 00:38.633
UH, MAYBE 10
TO 15 MORE MINUTES.

00:38.667 --> 00:40.367
AH, VERY GOOD,

00:40.400 --> 00:43.700
YEAH, I THINK YOU'LL BE VERY
HAPPY WITH THE TREATMENT.

00:43.733 --> 00:45.567
MM-HMM.

00:45.600 --> 00:47.567
YOU ACTUALLY YOU THINK
YOU'RE GONNA FIX MY NECK, HUH ?

00:47.600 --> 00:49.800
WELL, OF COURSE,
I ABSOLUTELY GUARANTEE IT

00:49.833 --> 00:51.933
IF YOU FOLLOW
MY PRESCRIBED COURSE.

00:51.967 --> 00:53.033
UH-HUH.

00:53.067 --> 00:54.500
FOUR TO SIX WEEKS,
MAYBE TWICE A WEEK.

00:54.533 --> 00:55.733
MM-HMM.
YEAH.

00:55.767 --> 00:57.400
WELL, FORGIVE ME FOR
SOUNDING A LITTLE CYNICAL,

00:57.433 --> 00:59.067
BUT I'VE HEARD
THAT BEFORE.

00:59.100 --> 01:00.667
YOU HAVE ?

01:00.700 --> 01:02.367
OH, YEAH, I'VE BEEN TO
A LOT OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE.

01:02.400 --> 01:04.267
THEY ALL KIND OF
TELL ME THE SAME THING.

01:04.300 --> 01:05.133
REALLY ?

01:05.167 --> 01:06.200
I NEVER GET
ANY RESULTS.

01:06.233 --> 01:08.567
I'VE BEEN TO DOCTORS
AND CHIROPRACTORS AND...

01:08.600 --> 01:11.467
HEALERS, PEOPLE WHO
CALL THEMSELVES HEALERS.

01:11.500 --> 01:12.333
( laughing )

01:12.367 --> 01:13.467
YEAH, HEALERS.

01:13.500 --> 01:14.400
WHAT A JOKE
THAT IS.

01:14.433 --> 01:16.333
WELL, I UNDERSTAND
YOUR CONCERNS.

01:16.367 --> 01:18.800
BUT ACUPUNCTURE HAS BEEN
AROUND FOR A LONG TIME

01:18.833 --> 01:21.100
AND IT'S BEEN IN MY FAMILY
FOR SEVERAL HUNDRED YEARS.

01:21.133 --> 01:22.100
YEAH ?

01:22.133 --> 01:23.100
YES.

01:23.133 --> 01:24.100
UH-HUH.

01:24.133 --> 01:25.767
I ABSOLUTELY GUARANTEE
TOTAL RECOVERY.

01:25.800 --> 01:26.800
YOU DO, HUH ?

01:26.833 --> 01:27.700
YES.

01:27.733 --> 01:28.733
OKAY, I'LL TELL
YOU WHAT.

01:28.767 --> 01:30.100
I GOT A LITTLE
PROPOSITION FOR YOU.

01:30.133 --> 01:31.333
HMM ?

01:31.367 --> 01:34.400
IF YOU CAN FIX MY NECK,
I'LL GIVE YOU $5,000.

01:34.433 --> 01:36.067
AND IF YOU CAN'T,

01:36.067 --> 01:38.267
THEN I DON'T PAY FOR
ANY OF THE TREATMENTS.

01:38.300 --> 01:39.667
$5,000 ?

01:39.700 --> 01:40.933
$5,000.

01:40.967 --> 01:43.067
IF I TREAT YOU
AND YOU RECOVER ?

01:43.067 --> 01:44.067
YEP.

01:44.100 --> 01:46.067
AND IF YOU DO NOT RECOVER,
I GET NOTHING ?

01:46.067 --> 01:47.267
YOU GET NOTHING.

01:47.300 --> 01:49.433
WELL, IT WOULD BE LIKE TAKING
CANDY FROM A BABY, BUT--

01:49.467 --> 01:50.433
REALLY ?

01:50.467 --> 01:51.267
YES.

01:51.300 --> 01:53.300
I LOVE
YOUR CONFIDENCE.

01:53.333 --> 01:55.267
WELL, WAIT A MINUTE NOW,
IF I CURE YOU,

01:55.300 --> 01:57.700
HOW WOULD I KNOW IF
YOU ARE CURED OR NOT ?

01:57.733 --> 01:59.767
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING ?

01:59.800 --> 02:01.700
YOU'RE SAYING THAT
I WOULDN'T TELL YOU ?

02:01.733 --> 02:03.967
JUST SO I WOULDN'T HAVE TO PAY
THE MONEY, THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

02:04.067 --> 02:06.167
COME ON,
I'M A MAN OF HONOR.

02:06.200 --> 02:08.067
IT'S A FAMILY
TRADITION, HONOR.

02:08.067 --> 02:09.367
WELL, IT'S NOT
IN MY FAMILY,

02:09.400 --> 02:12.067
BUT I'M TRYING
TO BREAK THE MOLD.

02:12.100 --> 02:13.467
ALRIGHT, DONE.

02:13.500 --> 02:16.267
I HOPE YOU WIN.

02:26.267 --> 02:27.600
LARRY ?

02:27.633 --> 02:29.967

02:48.100 --> 02:49.133
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
LOOK AT ME THAT WAY,

02:49.167 --> 02:50.633
NO NEED FOR PITY.

02:50.667 --> 02:53.800
NO, I MEAN, I'M JUST
SHOCKED TO SEE YOU HERE...

02:53.833 --> 02:56.167

02:56.200 --> 02:58.067
HOW LONG YOU

02:58.067 --> 02:59.600
IT'S BEEN AWHILE.

02:59.633 --> 03:01.833
WHAT DO YOU WANT ?

03:02.800 --> 03:04.367

03:04.400 --> 03:07.767
QUARTER POUND OF SWISS

03:07.800 --> 03:09.333
QUARTER POUND
OF SWISS...

03:09.367 --> 03:10.233
( together )
AND A HALF
POUND OF TURKEY.

03:10.267 --> 03:12.067
ALRIGHT.

03:12.067 --> 03:14.933
DO YOU EVER HEAR FROM
ANY OF THOSE OLD GUYS

03:14.967 --> 03:18.067
UH, YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES YOU

03:22.700 --> 03:25.900

HAPPENING, HUH ?

03:25.933 --> 03:29.200
WELL, YOU KNOW, JUST COULDN'T
WRITE FOR TV ANYMORE.

03:29.233 --> 03:31.433
THINGS ARE GOING GOOD.

03:31.467 --> 03:33.067
EXCEPT FOR THIS THING
WITH MY DAD...

03:33.067 --> 03:34.067
SITUATION.

03:34.100 --> 03:35.467
YOU REMEMBER
MY DAD ?

03:35.500 --> 03:36.600
YEAH.

03:36.633 --> 03:39.600
HE CAME TO YOUR HOUSE,
YEAH, I REMEMBER.

03:39.633 --> 03:41.633
HE'S DOING THIS LIKE...

03:41.667 --> 03:43.267
( coughing )

03:43.300 --> 03:44.400
THIS WEIRD
NUMBER ON ME--

03:44.433 --> 03:47.367
TRY AND PUT THAT
ON THE SWISS IF YOU CAN.

03:47.400 --> 03:48.333
I COVERED MY MOUTH.

03:48.367 --> 03:49.267
YEAH, SURE.

03:49.300 --> 03:51.333
YEAH, SO, MY DAD
IS JUST DOING THIS,

03:51.367 --> 03:53.600
HE'S BASICALLY DYING
IS WHAT'S HAPPENING.

03:53.633 --> 03:57.167
AND HE HAD
A TRIPLE BYPASS,

03:57.200 --> 03:58.533
A QUADRUPLE BYPASS.

03:58.567 --> 04:01.567
OH, BOY, HE'S GOT SEVEN
TOTAL BASES THERE, YEAH.

04:01.600 --> 04:03.933
AND UH, HE'S LEFT ME
THE MONEY IN HIS WILL.

04:03.967 --> 04:06.067
BUT HE WON'T LET ME
HAVE ANY OF IT, YOU KNOW ?

04:06.067 --> 04:09.467
NOT A PENNY, UNTIL, LIKE,
HE'S ACTUALLY DEAD.

04:09.500 --> 04:11.900
YOUR FATHER'S GOT A LOT
OF MONEY, DOESN'T HE ?

04:11.933 --> 04:13.900
YEAH, YEAH, YOU KNOW,
AND SO, IT'S, UH...

04:13.933 --> 04:15.467
HE KNOWS YOU'RE

04:15.500 --> 04:16.733
OF COURSE
HE DOES, YEAH.

04:16.767 --> 04:19.067
AND HE WON'T GIVE YOU
THE MONEY UNTIL HE DIES ?

04:19.100 --> 04:20.367
WHY DO PEOPLE
DO THAT ?

04:20.400 --> 04:22.733
I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU HAVE
TO WAIT UNTIL HE DIES.

04:22.767 --> 04:23.933
THAT'S CRAZY.

04:23.967 --> 04:26.567
YOU'D THINK THAT HE WOULD
WANT HIS KID TO BE HAPPY,

04:26.600 --> 04:28.600
LIKE, FOR, AS HIS LAST
MEMORIES OF HIM, YOU KNOW ?

04:28.633 --> 04:30.400
ARE YOU GUYS OUT OF
PEANUT BUTTER HERE

04:30.433 --> 04:31.967
'CAUSE I CAN'T
FIND IT.

04:32.067 --> 04:34.600
UM, HEY, LET ME
ASK YOU SOMETHING.

04:34.633 --> 04:38.200
IT'S REALLY AMAZING THAT
YOU CAME IN HERE TODAY.

04:38.233 --> 04:39.467
IT COULD REALLY
HELP ME OUT.

04:39.500 --> 04:40.367
RIGHT.

04:40.400 --> 04:42.700
I NEED TO
BORROW $5,000.

04:42.733 --> 04:45.867
OF COURSE YOU DO.

04:45.900 --> 04:48.300
I'LL BE ABLE TO PAY YOU BACK
AS SOON AS HE, YOU KNOW,

04:48.333 --> 04:49.467
AS HE GOES.

04:49.500 --> 04:51.833
YEAH, WHEN DO EXPECT
THAT'LL BE ?

04:51.867 --> 04:53.100
VERY SOON...

04:53.133 --> 04:55.267
VERY SOON.

04:55.300 --> 04:57.933
OKAY, TELL ME IF
I GOT THIS RIGHT.

04:57.967 --> 04:59.500
YOU GAVE $5,000 TO
THE ACUPUNCTURIST ?

04:59.533 --> 05:00.600
YEAH.

05:00.633 --> 05:02.767
AND $5,000 TO THAT
ASSHOLE, BARRY WEINER ?

05:02.800 --> 05:04.167
OH, ASSHOLE.

05:04.200 --> 05:05.400
UMM...

05:05.433 --> 05:09.733
SO, IN THE LAST THREE HOURS
YOU'VE GIVEN AWAY $10,000.

05:11.600 --> 05:13.733
YEAH, IT'S NOT
QUITE ACCURATE.

05:13.767 --> 05:14.933
I HAVEN'T GIVEN
THE ACUPUNCTURIST

05:14.967 --> 05:16.133
THE $5,000 YET.

05:16.167 --> 05:17.800
HE HAS TO CURE MY NECK
AND I'LL BE HAPPY TO

05:17.833 --> 05:19.233
GIVE IT TO HIM IF
HE DOES, BY THE WAY.

05:19.267 --> 05:20.833
AND...

05:20.867 --> 05:22.933
WEINER'S FATHER
HAS A HEART CONDITION

05:22.967 --> 05:24.233
AND HE'S NOT SUPPOSED
TO LIVE THAT LONG,

05:24.267 --> 05:25.767
AND THEN HE'LL GIVE ME
THE MONEY BACK.

05:25.800 --> 05:28.567
AND I DON'T KNOW WHY
YOU CALL HIM AN ASSHOLE.

05:28.600 --> 05:30.500
HE'S NOT AN ASSHOLE,
HE'S JUST SHY.

05:30.533 --> 05:31.900
NO, HE'S NOT SHY.

05:31.933 --> 05:33.800
HE THINKS HE'S SMARTER
THAN EVERYBODY ELSE,

05:33.833 --> 05:35.533
AND HE SITS THERE
AND HE JUDGES AND HE--

05:35.567 --> 05:37.400
NO, HE DOESN'T,
HE'S JUST SHY.

05:37.433 --> 05:39.900
YOU GOT SHY ASSHOLE CONFUSION,
MY FRIEND.

05:39.933 --> 05:41.233
NO, I DON'T THINK SO,
MY FRIEND.

05:41.267 --> 05:42.567
YES, I THINK SO,
MY FRIEND.

05:42.600 --> 05:44.900
PEOPLE COME TO YOU WITH THEIR
HANDS OUT, YOU CAN'T SAY NO ?

05:44.933 --> 05:47.500
I HAVE TROUBLE
SAYING NO.

05:47.533 --> 05:48.500
YOU KNOW WHY ?

05:48.533 --> 05:49.500
( knocking )

05:49.533 --> 05:50.900
'CAUSE YOU'RE
A PUSSY.

05:50.933 --> 05:52.267
I'M BEING FRANK.

05:52.300 --> 05:53.500
MAYBE I'M NICE.

05:53.533 --> 05:55.500
YOU HAVE NICE
PUSSY CONFUSION.

05:55.533 --> 05:56.867
MAYBE I'M JUST NICE.

05:56.900 --> 06:01.467
AND HE INVITED US TO HIS
WIFE'S SURPRISE BIRTHDAY PARTY

06:01.500 --> 06:03.567
AND I COULDN'T SAY
NO TO THAT EITHER.

06:03.600 --> 06:06.200
HEY THERE,
FLOWERS FOR LARRY DAVID.

06:07.633 --> 06:10.700
CHERYL, SOMEBODY
SENT ME FLOWERS.

06:10.733 --> 06:12.233
ARE THOSE FROM
YOUR MISTRESS

06:12.267 --> 06:13.333
AND YOU JUST HAVEN'T
TOLD ME ABOUT THAT ?

06:13.367 --> 06:14.367
YEAH, I WISH.

06:14.400 --> 06:15.633
THANKS.

06:15.667 --> 06:18.067
DID YOU GIVE HIM
A $5,000 TIP ?

06:18.067 --> 06:21.367
THIS IS REALLY
BIZARRE.

06:22.567 --> 06:23.533
FLOWERS.

06:23.567 --> 06:25.533
WHO WOULD
SEND YOU FLOWERS ?

06:25.567 --> 06:27.500
I DON'T KNOW.

06:27.533 --> 06:28.833
THEY'RE PRETTY.

06:28.867 --> 06:33.067
"ENJOY THESE BEAUTIFUL
ORCHIDS, KAZU."

06:33.067 --> 06:34.733
WHO'S KAZU ?

06:34.767 --> 06:37.267
THE ACUPUNCTURIST.

06:38.933 --> 06:40.733
( laughing )

06:40.767 --> 06:44.467
WHY IS THE ACUPUNCTURIST
GIVING YOU FLOWERS ?

06:46.167 --> 06:47.800
I DON'T KNOW.

06:52.233 --> 06:53.400
SO, I DON'T KNOW, YOU KNOW,
WORKING IN THE DELI,

06:53.433 --> 06:54.533
IT WAS JUST,

06:54.567 --> 06:56.800
IT WAS DEPRESSING
TO SEE HIM LIKE THAT.

06:56.833 --> 06:59.233
DID YOU EVEN KNOW, DID YOU
KNOW HE WAS WORKING THERE ?

06:59.267 --> 07:01.567
NO, I DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS
WORKING IN THE DELI.

07:01.600 --> 07:02.800
HE KEEPS IN
CONTACT WITH ME.

07:02.833 --> 07:04.433
BUT HE DIDN'T LET ME
KNOW THAT STUFF.

07:04.467 --> 07:05.567
UH-HUH, BOY.

07:05.600 --> 07:08.067
BUT FOR THE GRACE OF GOD,
GO YOU.

07:08.067 --> 07:09.300
GO ME, NOT YOU ?

07:09.333 --> 07:10.700
NO, NOT ME.

07:10.733 --> 07:12.367
YEAH, GO ME.

07:12.400 --> 07:15.533
HE INVITED ME TO
A SURPRISE PARTY...

07:15.567 --> 07:16.933
NEXT THURSDAY NIGHT
FOR HIS WIFE.

07:16.967 --> 07:17.967
YOU'RE GOING ?

07:18.067 --> 07:19.333
YEAH, I'LL PICK YOU UP,
WE'LL GO TOGETHER.

07:19.367 --> 07:22.567
SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF
THIS WHOLE ORCHID THING ?

07:22.600 --> 07:24.367
IT'S, YOU KNOW, I THINK
IT'S SOME SORT OF

07:24.400 --> 07:25.800
JAPANESE, GAY THING.

07:25.833 --> 07:26.800
REALLY ?
YEAH.

07:26.833 --> 07:28.800
THIS IS A LITTLE STRANGE,

07:28.833 --> 07:30.133
I DON'T KNOW IF
I'LL EVEN GO BACK TO HIM.

07:30.167 --> 07:31.933
I DON'T THINK I'LL GO BACK,
'CAUSE OF TH.

07:31.967 --> 07:33.533
WOULD YOU ?
I DON'T KNOW ?

07:33.567 --> 07:34.333
WOULD YOU GO BACK ?

07:34.367 --> 07:35.967
IT'S A WEIRD THING.

07:36.067 --> 07:37.167
I WOULDN'T GO BACK.

07:37.200 --> 07:40.200
LET ME ASK YOU
A QUESTION.

07:40.233 --> 07:44.433
IS IT COMMON IN JAPAN FOR A MAN
TO SEND ANOTHER MAN ORCHIDS,

07:44.467 --> 07:46.600
A PROFESSIONAL MAN ?

07:48.067 --> 07:50.567
DOCTOR, OR A...

07:51.433 --> 07:52.933
( speaking Japanese )

07:54.400 --> 07:56.067
SEE, I KNEW YOU'D
OPEN UP A CAN OF WORMS

07:56.100 --> 07:57.367
JUST BY STARTING
TO ASK HIM.

07:57.400 --> 07:58.300
HE'S BEEN
WEIRD ALL LUNCH.

07:58.333 --> 07:59.300
WHAT THE HELL ?

07:59.333 --> 08:01.367
WHAT WAS THAT ?

08:01.400 --> 08:02.267
THAT GUY'S A FREAK.

08:02.300 --> 08:03.833
I THINK I STRUCK
A CHORD.

08:03.867 --> 08:04.867
HEY, LARRY.

08:04.900 --> 08:06.433
HEY, JOEL.

08:06.467 --> 08:08.167
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

08:08.200 --> 08:09.133
IT'S BEEN A FEW DAYS.

08:09.167 --> 08:11.167

A SAD STATE OF AFFAIRS.

08:59.100 --> 09:02.633

09:53.100 --> 09:54.100
WHERE'S JEFF ?

09:54.133 --> 09:55.133
I DON'T KNOW.

09:55.167 --> 09:56.633
HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
HERE 15 MINUTES AGO.

09:56.667 --> 09:57.633
I KNOW.

09:57.667 --> 09:59.333
WHY ARE WE EVEN RIDING
WITH HIM ANYWAY ?

09:59.367 --> 10:01.667
I DON'T KNOW, HE ASKED ME
IF HE COULD PICK US UP.

10:01.700 --> 10:03.133
AND YOU COULDN'T
SAY NO.

10:03.167 --> 10:04.633

JUST GO WITHOUT HIM.

10:04.667 --> 10:06.333
WELL, HE'LL,

LITTLE GIRL.

10:19.233 --> 10:20.367
LARRY !

10:20.400 --> 10:21.767

10:24.300 --> 10:25.800
WELL, ROOM SERVICE

10:25.833 --> 10:26.833
WHAT DO YOU WANT ?

10:26.867 --> 10:28.033

10:28.067 --> 10:29.833
YOU'RE NOT
WEARING THAT.

10:29.867 --> 10:30.900
WHAT, WHY ?

10:30.933 --> 10:32.500
YOU'RE NOT WEARING JEANS
TO THIS PARTY.

10:32.533 --> 10:34.667
THEY'RE NOT JEANS,
THEY'RE CORDUROY PANTS.

10:34.700 --> 10:35.900
THAT'S THE SAME THING.

10:35.933 --> 10:38.600
AND A BLUE SWEATSHIRT
AND A BLACK JACKET, NO.

10:38.633 --> 10:40.133
OH, BLUE AND BLACK
THAT'S NO GOOD ?

10:40.167 --> 10:41.133
THAT'S NO GOOD.

10:41.167 --> 10:42.100
YOU NEED TO CHANGE.

10:42.133 --> 10:43.333
SINCE WHEN IS
BLUE AND BLACK NO GOOD ?

10:43.367 --> 10:44.900
TRUST ME ON
THIS ONE, PLEASE.

10:44.933 --> 10:46.200
YOU'RE GOING TO
HAVE TO CHANGE.

10:46.233 --> 10:47.400
AND QUICKLY.

10:47.433 --> 10:49.367
YOU LOOK TERRIBLE.

10:49.400 --> 10:50.633
IT'S AWFUL.

10:50.667 --> 10:52.500
MAYBE I HAVE A LIME GREEN
T-SHIRT LIKE YOURS TO PUT ON,

10:52.533 --> 10:53.633
ASSHOLE.

10:53.667 --> 10:55.267
WHAT'S WRONG WITH
A LIME GREEN T-SHIRT ?

10:55.300 --> 10:56.600
NO, IT LOOKS GOOD.

10:56.633 --> 10:57.900

11:12.700 --> 11:13.900
JEEZ.

11:13.933 --> 11:15.133
HI, CAROL.

11:15.167 --> 11:16.133
I DON'T KNOW
WHO TO HUG.

11:16.167 --> 11:17.333
HI.

11:17.367 --> 11:18.433
SO GOOD TO
SEE YOU.

11:18.467 --> 11:22.367
I WAS IN THE DELI
THE OTHER DAY.

11:22.400 --> 11:25.767
I LEFT MY SUNGLASSES,
I CAME BY TO PICK THEM UP.

11:25.800 --> 11:27.667
OH, MY GOSH.

11:27.700 --> 11:29.533
WOW, THIS IS

11:29.567 --> 11:30.433
SO, YOU GOT 'EM,

11:33.333 --> 11:34.100
WE'LL WAIT OUT HERE.

11:34.133 --> 11:36.300
WHAT IS THAT ?

11:36.333 --> 11:38.100
IT'S MY BIRTHDAY.

11:38.133 --> 11:40.733
THAT'S WHY WE GOT YOU
A BIRTHDAY GIFT.

11:40.767 --> 11:41.600
HE TOLD US IT
WAS YOUR BIRTHDAY.

11:41.633 --> 11:42.733
BUT WHY WOULD
YOU HAVE GOTTEN--

11:42.767 --> 11:44.167
'CAUSE HE TOLD ME
IT WAS YOUR BIRTHDAY,

11:44.200 --> 11:46.733
SO, I KNEW I WAS GONNA STOP BY
FOR THE SUNGLASSES AND I...

11:46.767 --> 11:48.100
IT'S FROM
THE THREE OF US.

11:48.133 --> 11:50.767
THERE'S A SURPRISE PARTY
IN THAT HOUSE.

11:50.800 --> 11:51.833
HONEY.

11:51.867 --> 11:53.833

11:55.633 --> 11:57.067

11:57.067 --> 11:58.267
OH, MY GOD, I...

11:58.300 --> 11:59.700

12:15.900 --> 12:17.467
YOU KNEW ?

12:17.500 --> 12:18.800
WHAT HAPPENED ?

12:18.833 --> 12:22.267
LARRY HAD TO CHANGE HIS
OUTFIT AND IT WAS JUST...

12:22.300 --> 12:23.867
A TREMENDOUS
AMOUNT OF TIME.

12:23.900 --> 12:25.067
HE HAD TO EAT.

12:25.100 --> 12:29.233
HAVE A BIG DINNER
FOR TWO HOURS.

12:29.267 --> 12:31.067
OH, MY GOD,
YOU GUYS, OH.

12:31.100 --> 12:34.867
SIT DOWN, HAVE A BIG
FUCKING MEAL IN THE HOTEL.

12:40.900 --> 12:44.100
DO YOU BELIEVE THEM, DO YOU
BELIEVE WHAT THEY DID TO ME ?

12:44.133 --> 12:46.600
I MEAN, 600,000 PEOPLE.

12:46.633 --> 12:49.900
600,000 PEOPLE DIED
IN THE CIVIL WAR.

12:49.933 --> 12:52.167
AND FOR WHAT,
TO SAVE THE UNION ?

12:52.200 --> 12:53.933
WHY, WHY DID WE WANT
TO SAVE THE UNION ?

12:53.967 --> 12:55.133
WHO CARES ?

12:55.167 --> 12:56.200
I DON'T KNOW,
I DON'T CARE.

12:56.233 --> 12:58.067
WHAT IS SO IMPORTANT
ABOUT SAVING THE UNION ?

12:58.067 --> 12:59.267
DO YOU NEED
THE SOUTH ?

12:59.300 --> 13:00.300
WHAT DO YOU DO ?

13:00.333 --> 13:02.467
WELL, I DO A LOT
OF WORK FOR THE NRDC.

13:02.500 --> 13:04.567
NRDC.

13:04.600 --> 13:06.800
WHAT THE HELL
IS THAT ?

13:06.833 --> 13:09.067
THE NATURAL RESOURCES
DEFENSE COUNSEL.

13:09.100 --> 13:10.600
OH, YOU'RE
AN ENVIRONMENTALIST ?

13:10.633 --> 13:11.767
I AM.

13:11.800 --> 13:12.800
THAT'S WONDERFUL.

13:12.833 --> 13:14.233
THANK YOU.

13:14.267 --> 13:17.400
I MEAN, I WISH MY SON COULD GET
INTO SOMETHING LIKE THAT,

13:17.433 --> 13:19.633
BUT NO, THERE'S
NO CHANCE OF THAT.

13:19.667 --> 13:20.700
NO.

13:20.733 --> 13:22.500
DO YOU BELIEVE MY WIFE
MADE ME CHANGE CLOTHES

13:22.533 --> 13:23.567
BEFORE I CAME
HERE TONIGHT ?

13:23.600 --> 13:24.567
SHE DIDN'T LIKE
MY OUTFIT.

13:24.600 --> 13:25.533
YOU LOOK GOOD,
THOUGH.

13:25.567 --> 13:27.467
I DIDN'T GET
"OUTFIT APPROVAL" TONIGHT.

13:27.500 --> 13:29.500
DO YOU GET THAT
"OUTFIT APPROVAL" ?

13:29.533 --> 13:30.900
HUH ?

13:30.933 --> 13:31.700
THEY GOT TO APPROVE
YOUR OUTFIT.

13:31.733 --> 13:33.500
I LISTENED TO HER.

13:33.533 --> 13:35.700
I ACTUALLY WENT
UP TO CHANGE.

13:35.733 --> 13:36.800
RIGHT.

13:36.833 --> 13:38.433
THAT'S ONE OF
THE REASONS THAT...

13:38.467 --> 13:40.267
YOU KNOW,
WE WERE LATE.

13:40.300 --> 13:41.867
'CAUSE I LISTENED
TO HER.

13:41.900 --> 13:43.467
IF WE'RE NOT FIGHTING
FOR THE ENVIRONMENT,

13:43.500 --> 13:45.467
THEN WE'RE FIGHTING
TO GET MONEY

13:45.500 --> 13:46.467
SO, WE CAN FIGHT
FOR THE ENVIRONMENT.

13:46.500 --> 13:47.300
MONEY ?

13:47.333 --> 13:48.367
YOU ALWAYS
NEED MONEY.

13:48.400 --> 13:51.467
WELL, IT'S A NON-PROFIT
ORGANIZATION, SO...

13:51.500 --> 13:52.967
YOU NEVER CALLED ME.

13:53.067 --> 13:54.433
NO, I DIDN'T.

13:54.467 --> 13:55.800
I DIDN'T
KNOW YOU--

13:55.833 --> 13:57.433
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT,
I'M NOT POOR.

13:57.467 --> 13:58.700
YOU AREN'T ?

13:58.733 --> 14:00.400
WELL, MR. WEINER,
MAYBE WE SHOULD TALK.

14:00.433 --> 14:01.767
OH, CALL ME C.D.

14:01.800 --> 14:03.633
MM, WHAT DOES
C.D. STAND FOR ?

14:03.667 --> 14:05.933
OH, LET'S SEE.

14:05.967 --> 14:07.967
IT MIGHT STAND FOR
"CERTIFIED DEPOSIT".

14:08.067 --> 14:10.733
FOR THE NRDC.

14:10.767 --> 14:12.333
I LIKE THE SOUND
OF THAT.

14:12.367 --> 14:14.600
YOU WANT TO
HAVE LUNCH ?

14:14.633 --> 14:17.533
AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT
HOW WE CAN ARRANGE

14:17.567 --> 14:19.700
MAYBE MY CONTRIBUTING
SOMETHING ?

14:19.733 --> 14:21.933
OH, MY GOSH, THAT
WOULD BE WONDERFUL.

14:21.967 --> 14:25.333
YEAH, WELL, YOU'RE NOT GONNA
JUST TALK ABOUT MONEY.

14:25.367 --> 14:26.667
OF COURSE NOT.

14:26.700 --> 14:27.800
WE'LL TALK ABOUT
EACH OTHER.

14:27.833 --> 14:29.300
OKAY.

14:29.333 --> 14:30.733
I'D LIKE TO GET
TO KNOW YOU.

14:30.767 --> 14:31.733
WOW.

14:31.767 --> 14:33.400
I'D LIKE TO GET
TO KNOW YOU TOO.

14:33.433 --> 14:35.433
OH, MY GOD, YOU'RE GONNA
GIVE ME ANOTHER HEART ATTACK.

14:35.467 --> 14:38.433
STOP IT, MR. WEINER.

14:38.467 --> 14:40.500
OH, MY GOODNESS.

14:40.533 --> 14:42.800
YOU'RE SO CHARMING
AND BEAUTIFUL.

14:42.833 --> 14:45.900
I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT
SCHLEP EVER MARRIED YOU.

14:45.933 --> 14:47.567
ME EITHER.

14:53.567 --> 14:55.400
I THINK I DO
KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

14:55.433 --> 14:58.867
I MEAN IT VERY
SINCERELY.

14:59.867 --> 15:00.767
HI.

15:00.800 --> 15:03.067
YOU REMEMBER
BARRY'S FATHER ?

15:03.067 --> 15:04.067
I SURE DO,
HOW YOU DOING ?

15:04.100 --> 15:04.967
HI, HOW ARE YOU ?

15:05.067 --> 15:06.133
GOOD TO
SEE YOU.
GOOD.

15:06.167 --> 15:08.533
WELL, PLEASE EXCUSE ME
TO THE LADIES' ROOM.

15:08.567 --> 15:09.900
LARRY, WHY DON'T YOU
HAVE A SEAT HERE ?

15:09.933 --> 15:11.733
AND CHAT WITH
MR. WEINER.

15:11.767 --> 15:12.733
YOU WILL BE BACK,
THOUGH ?

15:12.767 --> 15:13.900
I WILL BE BACK.

15:13.933 --> 15:16.067
'CAUSE HE CERTAINLY
CAN'T FILL IN FOR YOU.

15:16.067 --> 15:16.833
NO, HE CAN'T.

15:16.867 --> 15:17.833
BUT HE'LL
DO HIS BEST.

15:17.867 --> 15:18.833
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

15:18.867 --> 15:20.300
YOU'LL COME
RIGHT BACK.

15:20.333 --> 15:21.967
YEAH.

15:22.067 --> 15:24.200
OH, MY GOD.

15:24.233 --> 15:27.700
WHAT A TREAT,
OH, GOD.

15:32.833 --> 15:35.700
IS IT A CUSTOM
IN JAPAN FOR...

15:35.733 --> 15:38.067
A MAN TO SEND

15:38.067 --> 15:41.233
ORCHIDS TO
ANOTHER MAN ?

15:41.267 --> 15:43.967
LIKE A PROFESSIONAL,
SOMEONE WHO'S A PROFESSIONAL,

15:44.067 --> 15:46.067
A DOCTOR OR A DENTIST
OR AN...

15:46.067 --> 15:47.933
ACUPUNCTURIST ?

15:47.967 --> 15:51.267
NOW, HOW THE HELL WOULD
I KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS ?

15:51.300 --> 15:53.233
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THEY DO IN JAPAN.

15:53.267 --> 15:56.467
THEY MIGHT TAKE IT UP THE ASS
FOR ALL I KNOW IN JAPAN.

15:56.500 --> 15:58.500
WHAT ARE YOU
ASKIN' ME FOR ?

15:58.533 --> 16:00.200
IT'S A STUPID
QUESTION.

16:00.233 --> 16:03.800
SO, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING THESE DAYS ?

16:03.833 --> 16:05.500
I'M WORKING ON...

16:05.533 --> 16:09.200
ACTUALLY A NEW SHOW
FOR JULIA LOUIS-DREYFUS

16:09.233 --> 16:10.333
FROM "SEINFELD" ?

16:10.367 --> 16:11.333
YEAH.

16:11.367 --> 16:14.167
YOU GOT TO BE
KIDDING ME.

16:14.200 --> 16:15.833
WELL, HOW DO YOU
KNOW HER ?

16:15.867 --> 16:17.567
I WORKED ON
THE SHOW.

16:17.600 --> 16:19.300
WHAT SHOW,
"SEINFELD" ?

16:19.333 --> 16:20.467
YEAH, "SEINFELD".

16:20.500 --> 16:21.367
WHAT DID YOU DO ?

16:21.400 --> 16:23.533
I WAS THE CO-CREATOR.

16:23.567 --> 16:26.067
YOU MUST HAVE
MADE A BUNDLE.

16:26.067 --> 16:27.400
I DID OKAY.

16:27.433 --> 16:29.500
YOU'RE A LUCKY BASTARD.

16:29.533 --> 16:31.700
I AM, I'M VERY LUCKY.

16:31.733 --> 16:33.200
AND I'LL TELL
YOU SOMETHING.

16:33.233 --> 16:37.967
I'M LUCKY THAT I HAD A FATHER
WHO WAS SO SUPPORTIVE OF ME

16:38.067 --> 16:39.967
BECAUSE WITHOUT HIM IT
NEVER WOULD HAVE HAPPENED.

16:40.067 --> 16:41.600
I WAS WORKING IN
A DRY CLEANER.

16:41.633 --> 16:42.700
I DIDN'T TELL HIM.

16:42.733 --> 16:45.600
I HAD NO MONEY, BUT I NEEDED
TO SUPPORT MYSELF.

16:45.633 --> 16:48.267
AND THEN ONE DAY,
HE FOUND OUT ABOUT IT...

16:49.700 --> 16:51.933
NEXT THING I KNEW,
HE SAID TO ME

16:51.967 --> 16:53.100
LISTEN, I GOT
A LOT OF MONEY.

16:53.133 --> 16:57.067
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU THIS MONEY
ANYWAY, AFTER I DIE.

16:57.067 --> 16:58.633
LET ME GIVE
YOU SOME NOW.

16:58.667 --> 16:59.833
YOUR FATHER LEFT YOU
MONEY BEFORE HE DIED ?

16:59.867 --> 17:01.233
OH, YES, HE DID.

17:01.267 --> 17:04.100
HE GAVE ME A QUARTER OF WHAT
I WAS GONNA GET IN THE WILL

17:04.133 --> 17:06.733
AND THAT ENABLED ME TO
GO OUT AND START WRITING.

17:06.767 --> 17:08.800
I NEVER WOULD HAVE GOTTEN
"SEINFELD" IF NOT FOR HIM.

17:08.833 --> 17:13.667
AND I WAS ABLE TO PUT FOOD
IN THE REFRIGERATOR,

17:13.700 --> 17:14.600
WHEN HE CAME OVER,

17:14.633 --> 17:16.067
HE HAD GREAT
THINGS TO EAT.

17:16.067 --> 17:18.467
I BOUGHT A BARCOLOUNGER,
A BIG SCREEN TV

17:18.500 --> 17:19.867
WITH THE MONEY.

17:19.900 --> 17:22.633
WHEN HE'D COME OVER TO MY HOUSE
HE COULD SIT AND RELAX.

17:22.667 --> 17:25.300
WHY SHOULD HE WAIT UNTIL HE'S
DEAD TO GIVE ME THE MONEY ?

17:25.333 --> 17:26.233
IT'S RIDICULOUS.

17:26.267 --> 17:29.200
LISTEN,
PUT A SOCK IN IT.

17:29.233 --> 17:30.367
I GOT TO MOVE FAST.

17:30.400 --> 17:31.633
DO YOU KNOW OF
AN ESTATE LAWYER ?

17:31.667 --> 17:33.067
MY LAWYER'S
IN ACAPULCO.

17:33.100 --> 17:34.767
I NEED AN ESTATE
LAWYER RIGHT AWAY.

17:34.800 --> 17:36.967
YEAH, I KNOW A GREAT
ESTATE LAWYER, JOEL REYNOLDS.

17:37.067 --> 17:38.233
I JUST RAN INTO HIM
THE OTHER DAY.

17:38.267 --> 17:39.500
REYNOLDS,
WHERE HE IS ?

17:39.533 --> 17:40.900
YEAH, HE'S IN
SANTA MONICA.

17:40.933 --> 17:42.433
REYNOLDS AND MCKAY,
HE'S GREAT.

17:42.467 --> 17:43.400
HE'S GOOD
WITH ESTATES ?

17:43.433 --> 17:44.367
HE'S TERRIFIC, YEAH.

17:44.400 --> 17:46.067
YOU MEAN,
THAT KIND OF STUFF.

17:46.100 --> 17:47.767
I GOTTA MAKE A CHANGE
RIGHT AWAY

17:47.800 --> 17:49.600
AND I CAN'T WAIT
FOR MY LAWYER.

17:49.633 --> 17:51.733
THANK YOU FOR
THE LAWYER.

17:51.767 --> 17:52.933
AND I LOVE
YOUR WIFE.

17:52.967 --> 17:55.433
WHAT KIND OF CHANGE,
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ?

17:55.467 --> 17:56.933
YOU'LL FIND OUT.

18:02.233 --> 18:03.200
I DON'T KNOW, CHERYL.

18:03.233 --> 18:04.867
MAYBE HE'LL MAKE
A CONTRIBUTION.

18:04.900 --> 18:08.867
HEY, THE WORST THAT CAN HAPPEN
IS YOU'LL FLY TO MEXICO WITH HIM

18:08.900 --> 18:10.200
AND COME BACK
WITH A BIG CHECK.

18:10.233 --> 18:11.567
HA-HA.

18:11.600 --> 18:14.167
WHERE ARE YOU
MEETING FOR LUNCH ?

18:14.200 --> 18:16.833
OH, THAT'S
THE JAPANESE RESTAURANT.

18:16.867 --> 18:18.633
I WAS THERE WITH
JEFF LAST WEEK.

18:20.767 --> 18:23.433
HEY, BARRY WEINER'S HERE.

18:23.467 --> 18:26.333
ALRIGHT, LISTEN, GET AS MUCH
MONEY AS YOU CAN FROM HIM.

18:26.367 --> 18:27.233
BE CHARMING.

18:27.267 --> 18:28.967
OKAY, GOODBYE.

18:29.067 --> 18:29.967
WHAT DID YOU DO ?

18:30.067 --> 18:31.667
WHAT THE HELL
DID YOU DO ?

18:31.700 --> 18:34.667
DID YOU TELL MY FATHER SOME
STORY ABOUT A DRY CLEANER ?

18:34.700 --> 18:38.433
YEAH, I TOLD HIM THAT
I WORKED IN A DRY CLEANER,

18:38.467 --> 18:40.733
AND MY FATHER FOUND OUT
ABOUT IT AND THEN,

18:40.767 --> 18:42.467
INSTEAD OF GIVING ME
THE MONEY AFTER HE DIED,

18:42.500 --> 18:44.500
HE GAVE IT TO ME
BEFORE HE DIED.

18:44.533 --> 18:46.967
YEAH, WELL, YOUR LITTLE
CONSPIRACY WITH CHERYL WORKED.

18:47.067 --> 18:48.600
HE CUT ME OUT OF
THE WILL, LARRY.

18:48.633 --> 18:50.967
HE THINKS THAT
I PUT YOU UP TO IT,

18:51.067 --> 18:52.167
AND NOW, HE'S CUT ME
OUT OF THE WILL

18:52.200 --> 18:54.600
AND GIVEN ALL
HIS MONEY TO NDRC.

18:54.633 --> 18:56.167
NRDC.

18:56.200 --> 18:57.633
NRDC, WHATEVER
THE HELL IT IS.

18:57.667 --> 19:00.267
JUST LIKE YOU AND CHERYL
PLANNED, YOUR LITTLE CONSPIRACY.

19:00.300 --> 19:03.067
BUT WHY, WHEN HE LEFT
LAST NIGHT AFTER THE STORY,

19:03.100 --> 19:04.867
HE SAID HE WAS GOING
TO GET A LAWYER

19:04.900 --> 19:06.333
AND HE WANTED A LAWYER AND
THE NAME OF A LAWYER FROM ME.

19:06.367 --> 19:07.500
THE LAWYER THAT
YOU GAVE HIM.

19:07.533 --> 19:09.500
HE'S DOWN THERE
RIGHT NOW, LARRY.

19:09.533 --> 19:13.400
HE IS DOWN THERE FLUSHING
MY FUCKING LIFE DOWN THE TOILET.

19:13.433 --> 19:15.600
THAT'S WHAT HE'S DOING
RIGHT NOW, THANKS TO YOUR HELP.

19:15.633 --> 19:20.067
OKAY, ALRIGHT,
BYE-BYE.

19:21.067 --> 19:22.900
HELLO, SIR,
JOEL REYNOLDS.

19:22.933 --> 19:26.067
YOU'RE JOEL REYNOLDS ?

19:26.100 --> 19:27.067
YES, I AM.

19:27.100 --> 19:28.667
WOULD YOU LIKE TO
HAVE A SEAT, SIR ?

19:28.700 --> 19:29.767
YEAH, IN A MINUTE.

19:29.800 --> 19:32.967
UH, I'M A LITTLE
PUZZLED.

19:33.067 --> 19:34.733
WHAT'S THIS OUTFIT,
IS IT A HALLOWEEN PARTY,

19:34.767 --> 19:35.600
OR WHAT IS IT ?

19:35.633 --> 19:38.067
OH, IT'S CASUAL FRIDAY.

19:38.067 --> 19:39.700
CASUAL FRIDAY,
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN ?

19:39.733 --> 19:41.600
THAT MEANS WE DRESS
LIKE WE WOULD AT HOME.

19:41.633 --> 19:43.467
BUT YOU'RE
NOT AT HOME.

19:43.500 --> 19:45.067
NO, IT IS
CASUAL FRIDAY, SO.

19:45.067 --> 19:47.167
YEAH, I KNOW, YOU TOLD ME
THAT ALREADY.

19:47.200 --> 19:49.233
WHAT DO YOU DO
ON CASUAL FRIDAY ?

19:49.267 --> 19:51.167
WE JUST COME IN,
DO OUR WORK.

19:51.200 --> 19:53.633
BUT WE DRESS
CASUALLY.

19:53.667 --> 19:54.833
I DON'T LIKE IT.

19:54.867 --> 19:56.667
WELL, IT'S JUST
ONE DAY OF THE WEEK.

19:56.700 --> 19:58.933
I DON'T GIVE A DAMN
IF IT'S HALF A DAY A WEEK.

19:58.967 --> 20:00.533
I DON'T LIKE IT.

20:00.567 --> 20:02.100
I'M HERE TO
CHANGE MY WILL.

20:02.133 --> 20:03.500
A LOT OF MONEY
IS INVOLVED.

20:03.533 --> 20:04.800
IT'S VERY
IMPORTANT TO ME.

20:04.833 --> 20:05.900
OH, WE WOULDN'T
TREAT YOU CASUALLY.

20:05.933 --> 20:07.300
THEN WHY THE HELL
YOU DRESS THAT WAY ?

20:07.333 --> 20:08.400
IT'S JUST--

20:08.433 --> 20:09.900
I WANT YOU TO BE
ON CUTTING EDGE, MAN,

20:09.933 --> 20:11.333
WHENEVER YOU'RE
HANDLING MY BUSINESS.

20:11.367 --> 20:12.167
THIS IS CUTTING EDGE.

20:12.200 --> 20:13.333
I DON'T NEED
THIS CRAP.

20:13.367 --> 20:15.167
YOU LOOK LIKE
A FUCKING COWBOY.

20:15.200 --> 20:16.967
YOU'RE J.R., HUH ?

20:17.000 --> 20:18.133
JOEL REYNOLDS,
RIGHT ?

20:18.167 --> 20:20.600
YOU BELONG IN DALLAS,
NOT L.A.

20:20.633 --> 20:22.067
I'M SORRY,
PLEASE--

20:22.100 --> 20:24.500
YEAH, YOU SHOULD
BE SORRY

20:24.533 --> 20:27.000
BECAUSE YOU JUST
LOST MY ACCOUNT.

20:27.033 --> 20:29.267
YOU GO RANGLE
SOMEBODY ELSE'S.

20:29.300 --> 20:31.233
THANK YOU
VERY MUCH.

20:31.267 --> 20:32.600
SONOFABITCH.

20:32.633 --> 20:35.800
IF YOU COME BACK ON
A MONDAY OR A TUESDAY.

20:35.833 --> 20:38.667
YOU GOTTA TALK TO HIM AND TELL
HIM I DIDN'T PUT YOU UP TO THAT.

20:38.700 --> 20:41.167
YOU HAVE TO
CONVINCE HIM.

20:41.200 --> 20:42.500
I'M TOTALLY SCREWED.

20:42.533 --> 20:43.333
( phone )

20:43.367 --> 20:44.500
WAIT, HOLD ON.

20:44.533 --> 20:45.833
HELLO.

20:45.867 --> 20:47.600
Hi, this is Kathleen calling
from Dr. Moriyama's office.

20:47.633 --> 20:49.033
YEAH.

20:49.067 --> 20:50.800
I'm just calling to confirm
your acupuncture appointment.

20:50.833 --> 20:52.500
UH, NO,
I CAN'T DO IT.

20:52.533 --> 20:55.033
Okay, the doctor just wants
to know how you're feeling.

20:55.067 --> 20:56.067
I'M BETTER.

20:56.100 --> 20:57.233
That's good.

20:57.267 --> 20:59.800
Uh, would you like to
schedule another session ?

20:59.833 --> 21:02.767
UM, NO, NO.

21:02.800 --> 21:04.500
NOT NOW.

21:04.533 --> 21:05.900
Okay, thank you,
Mr. David.

21:05.933 --> 21:07.100
OKAY.

21:07.133 --> 21:09.267
YOU GOT TO GET
DOWN THERE.

21:09.300 --> 21:10.600
YOU GOT TO
DO SOMETHING.

21:10.633 --> 21:13.633
HE'S HAVING, HE'S SUPPOSED
TO HAVE LUNCH WITH MY WIFE

21:13.667 --> 21:15.067
AT THIS JAPANESE
RESTAURANT LATER.

21:15.067 --> 21:17.067
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE THAT
CAN FIX IT, YOU KNOW ?

21:17.067 --> 21:19.067
YOU HAVE TO
TALK TO HIM.

21:19.100 --> 21:20.467
SHIT.

21:20.500 --> 21:22.500
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO BE HELPFUL.

21:26.500 --> 21:29.067
UH, MR. WEINER, I DON'T THINK
I SHOULD HAVE ANYMORE--

21:29.067 --> 21:30.167
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO,
YOU SHOULD, YOU SHOULD.

21:30.200 --> 21:31.467
WELL, MAYBE AFTER.

21:31.500 --> 21:34.167
BECAUSE IT'S A WONDERFUL PREFACE
TO A GREAT JAPANESE MEAL.

21:34.200 --> 21:35.600
OKAY.COME ON.

21:35.633 --> 21:37.567
WELL, I THINK WE SHOULD GO
AHEAD AND ORDER THEN, AT LEAST.

21:37.600 --> 21:38.567
WE WILL ORDER
CERTAINLY.

21:38.600 --> 21:41.200
MM-HMM.

21:41.233 --> 21:43.600
BUT I HAVE SOME NEWS
FOR YOU FIRST...

21:43.633 --> 21:45.067
WELL, FIRST
A LITTLE SPICE.

21:45.100 --> 21:47.300
LARRY ?

21:47.333 --> 21:48.300
HI.

21:48.333 --> 21:49.300
HI.

21:49.333 --> 21:50.500
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE ?

21:50.533 --> 21:54.167
I JUST CAME TO APOLOGIZE
FOR LAST NIGHT.

21:54.200 --> 21:56.767
JUST TO LET YOU KNOW THAT
YOUR SON DID NOT PUT ME UP

21:56.800 --> 21:59.433
TO SAY ANY OF THAT STUFF
THAT I SAID TO YOU ABOUT...

21:59.467 --> 22:02.067
OH, HE DIDN'T,
NO, HE DIDN'T, HUH ?

22:02.100 --> 22:05.267
AND HE SHOULDN'T BE PUNISHED
AS A RESULT OF WHAT I DID ON...

22:11.500 --> 22:13.467
( yelling )

22:25.633 --> 22:28.367
WHY, YOU SHIT.

22:42.467 --> 22:45.133
OH, HI, HI,
NICE TO SEE YOU.

22:45.167 --> 22:46.200
HELLO.

22:46.233 --> 22:48.167
OH, HI, CAROL.

22:48.200 --> 22:49.600
UH, SO SORRY.

22:49.633 --> 22:50.800
HI.

22:52.100 --> 22:54.733
EVERYBODY, THIS IS
LARRY DAVID.

22:54.767 --> 22:55.933
LARRY AND I USED TO
WRITE TOGETHER

22:55.967 --> 22:56.933
ON "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE".

22:56.967 --> 22:58.167
A LONG TIME AGO.

22:58.200 --> 23:00.167
HERE'S HIS WIFE, CHERYL.

23:00.200 --> 23:01.133
HI.

23:01.167 --> 23:03.067
AND THIS IS
JEFF GREENE.

23:03.067 --> 23:05.333
JEFF USED TO
BE MY MANAGER.

23:07.267 --> 23:10.067
SO SUDDEN,
UNEXPECTED.

23:15.200 --> 23:17.400
LARRY, YOU REMEMBER,
MY COUSIN, DOUG...

23:17.433 --> 23:18.200
FROM THE PARTY,
THURSDAY ?

23:18.233 --> 23:19.833
SURE, HI, DOUG.

23:19.867 --> 23:21.300
HI.

23:21.333 --> 23:25.067
LARRY WAS THE LAST PERSON
TO SEE HIM ALIVE.

23:25.067 --> 23:28.500
WELL, TECHNICALLY
IT WAS THE WAITER.

23:28.533 --> 23:31.067
SO, YOU'RE THE ONE ?

23:37.600 --> 23:39.333
SO, WHAT DO YOU DO ?

23:39.367 --> 23:40.533
I'M A BUTTON MAN.

23:40.567 --> 23:41.600
BUTTON MAN ?

23:41.633 --> 23:43.833
YES, I SELL BUTTONS
TO THE CUT-UP TRADE.

23:43.867 --> 23:45.633
GARMENT MANUFACTURERS.

23:45.667 --> 23:48.500
I GOT A BELLY BUTTON
STORY FOR YOU.

23:48.533 --> 23:52.100
MY BEST FRIEND HAD
A BABY 15 YEARS AGO.

23:52.133 --> 23:53.300
AND I WAS
THE GODFATHER.

23:53.333 --> 23:55.067
AND I WAS IN THE DELIVERY ROOM
AND HE ASKED ME TO CUT

23:55.100 --> 23:57.100
THE UMBILICAL CORD
AND I DON'T KNOW,

23:57.133 --> 23:58.600
I KIND OF BOTCHED
IT SOMEHOW.

23:58.633 --> 24:01.200
AND MANGLED
THE WHOLE BELLY BUTTON

24:01.233 --> 24:04.533
AND NOW THE KID WON'T
EVEN TALK TO ME, IT'S...

24:04.567 --> 24:08.167
THAT'S A SAD STORY,
EXCUSE ME.

24:11.067 --> 24:13.400
LARRY, LARRY.

24:14.967 --> 24:16.267
THANK YOU.

24:16.300 --> 24:18.433
BACK UP, MAN,
YOU'RE RIGHT IN MY FACE.

24:18.467 --> 24:19.833
OH, OKAY.

24:19.867 --> 24:23.100
THERE IT IS.

24:23.133 --> 24:25.433
I TOLD YOU,
DON'T CASH IT FOR WEEK.

24:25.467 --> 24:27.067
OH, THIS IS--

24:27.067 --> 24:29.867
NO, I TOLD YOU YOU'D
GET IT AS SOON AS HE DIED

24:29.900 --> 24:30.967
AND YOU MADE
IT HAPPEN.

24:31.067 --> 24:32.100
I DIDN'T MAKE
ANYTHING HAPPEN.

24:32.133 --> 24:33.400
YOU KIND OF DID.

24:33.433 --> 24:36.267
THAT'S JUST GREAT, LARRY,
YOU GOT YOUR MONEY BACK.

24:37.067 --> 24:38.467
WHAT ?

24:38.500 --> 24:40.233

26:51.500 --> 26:54.700

26:54.733 --> 26:57.433

A CONFUSION HERE,

26:57.467 --> 26:59.167
