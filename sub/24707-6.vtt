WEBVTT

00:17.600 --> 00:20.520
DOA looks like a homicide.
Her car was locked up.

00:20.520 --> 00:22.564
We used a slim-jim to get EMS in there.

00:30.697 --> 00:31.865
She was strangled.

00:34.451 --> 00:36.411
She's got bite marks
on both her hands here, man.

00:36.578 --> 00:39.164
Her shoes are on the passenger side.
What the hell is that about?

00:39.622 --> 00:42.625
Her clothes... not messed up.
It doesn't look like it was a rape.

00:42.751 --> 00:46.212
We got lots of cash here, no car keys.

00:47.213 --> 00:48.256
Here.

00:49.591 --> 00:53.386
"Neera Muck... Muckup."

00:54.012 --> 00:55.555
You know, you'd think
when these people migrate,

00:55.764 --> 00:57.182
they'd take pronounceable names.

00:57.849 --> 01:00.769
- Like Sipowicz?
- Okay, wiseass. Go ahead, say that name.

01:02.479 --> 01:07.358
"Mokapade... Mokoopadearye..."
I don't know, man.

01:08.777 --> 01:11.905
Forget robbery. Look at this rock
she's wearing over here, man.

01:13.239 --> 01:15.033
You didn't see no car keys around here?

01:15.325 --> 01:18.453
- No. Like I said, we used a slim-jim.
- Yeah.

01:19.704 --> 01:21.706
Wouldn't be a carjacking gone bad, huh?

01:21.998 --> 01:23.708
We're never gonna know
what the hell this is about.

01:23.792 --> 01:25.502
You know,
I wish I could get off this case.

01:25.877 --> 01:28.421
Look at the red dot on her forehead.
Now what is that for, huh?

01:28.505 --> 01:30.173
You just tell me. What the hell is that?

01:30.173 --> 01:32.342
What is the difference between that
and people wearing earrings?

01:33.259 --> 01:34.469
You know what this is about?

01:34.636 --> 01:35.970
You wanna know what
this is gonna be about?

01:36.054 --> 01:39.641
- What?
- These people worship cows.

01:39.891 --> 01:41.476
They let 'em live in the house.

01:41.684 --> 01:44.145
They'd starve to death
before they'd eat 'em, okay?

01:44.270 --> 01:46.231
Andy, what does that
have to do with this DOA?

01:46.731 --> 01:48.775
Because 200 years ago,

01:48.900 --> 01:52.737
some bride wasn't a virgin,
and that cursed the whole family line,

01:52.987 --> 01:55.031
and now the moon is in Jupiter's asshole,

01:55.115 --> 01:58.952
and some great, great, great,
great, grandson had to wreak vengeance.

01:59.119 --> 02:01.079
And that's what this is gonna be about.

02:02.205 --> 02:03.915
So, now we got a theory to go on.

03:22.827 --> 03:23.870
Good morning

03:25.079 --> 03:26.581
- Morning.
- Goodness.

03:27.248 --> 03:29.500
Can I help you with something?
Who do you want to see?

03:30.126 --> 03:32.420
I'm Evelyn Sekzer.
I was sent by the borough.

03:32.712 --> 03:34.380
Oh, the temp for Miss Abandando.

03:34.672 --> 03:37.258
I wouldn't know about that.
They said three to five days.

03:37.508 --> 03:40.136
Our regular PA's
taking a computer course.

03:40.970 --> 03:43.514
We were actually expecting
someone last week.

03:43.598 --> 03:45.975
I had a couple of setbacks.

03:46.184 --> 03:49.062
- Yeah. I'm Arthur Fancy, squad lieutenant.
- Oh, hey.

03:49.354 --> 03:51.898
- How you doing?
- Hi. Are these the phone lines

03:51.898 --> 03:54.234
- I have to answer?
- Yeah. A number of our detectives

03:54.359 --> 03:57.320
are out on cases,
but you'll meet 'em as the shift goes on.

03:57.654 --> 03:59.948
But... but you want me to take
their messages prior to that, right?

04:00.198 --> 04:03.701
Well, yeah. Just write the names
on these message slips.

04:03.785 --> 04:06.371
I'm to wear slippers indoors.

04:08.539 --> 04:10.875
- Detective Squad.
- 15th Squad.

04:11.709 --> 04:13.002
Yeah, he's standing right here.

04:14.963 --> 04:16.381
Yeah, Lieutenant Fancy.

04:17.674 --> 04:19.217
- Morning.
- Morning.

04:20.176 --> 04:24.097
- Excuse me. Is that the, uh, coffee room?
- Yeah. Uh-huh.

04:24.305 --> 04:26.391
I was just gonna go get some.
Can I bring you some back?

04:26.891 --> 04:30.603
Oh, thanks. Yeah.
Cremora, two Sweet'N Low.

04:30.979 --> 04:34.107
- I'm Detective Russell.
- Evelyn Sekzer,

04:34.440 --> 04:35.900
civilian aide from the borough.

04:36.025 --> 04:39.112
We got an investigate DOA.
You and Adrienne wanna take it?

04:39.237 --> 04:40.238
Sure.
Okay.

04:40.697 --> 04:42.949
Uh... don't worry about the coffee
if you have to go.

04:43.074 --> 04:45.827
No. I just have to go get
the other detective for our assignment,

04:45.827 --> 04:47.453
then I'll bring it back to you
on my way out, all right?

04:48.162 --> 04:49.747
Thanks. All right.

04:53.334 --> 04:55.420
I guess these are gonna
be going all day, huh?

05:17.817 --> 05:19.569
- Yes?
- I'm Detective Simone.

05:19.569 --> 05:22.363
- This is Detective Sipowicz. Is Mr...
- No one is home.

05:23.197 --> 05:26.409
- What's your name?
- Jatin. I'm the houseboy.

05:26.784 --> 05:28.911
You go out anyplace today?
Anybody come in here to visit?

05:29.329 --> 05:32.665
- No.
- What about the woman of the house?

05:33.082 --> 05:34.959
- Where did she go?
- Mrs. Mukhopadhyay.

05:35.084 --> 05:36.085
She went to the restaurant.

05:36.294 --> 05:38.087
- What restaurant is that?
- The House of Rajesh,

05:38.588 --> 05:40.006
Mr. Mukhopadhyay's restaurant.

05:40.381 --> 05:42.300
- She left over an hour ago.
- Where is that at?

05:42.759 --> 05:44.719
- Sixth Street.
- She drive?

05:45.136 --> 05:46.679
- Yes, sir.
- She go alone?

05:47.221 --> 05:49.515
- Yes.
- All right. We'll go to the restaurant.

05:50.808 --> 05:54.562
- Uh, what's your last name?
- Why don't you quit while you're ahead?

05:55.355 --> 05:57.732
- Bhat.
- B-A-T?

05:58.483 --> 06:01.569
B-H-A-T. The cat got out.

06:02.111 --> 06:04.280
They're going to be angry with me.

06:06.491 --> 06:08.576
B-H-A-T. Bhat.

06:09.911 --> 06:12.080
Cat. C-H-A-T.

06:19.170 --> 06:21.631
I tell you, I wish they maintained
the streets a little better.

06:22.298 --> 06:24.884
You know, you could say that
about the whole infrastructure,

06:24.884 --> 06:26.594
- James, nationwide.
- Yeah.

06:27.553 --> 06:29.389
So, how'd it go with that Anita
last night?

06:29.764 --> 06:31.307
Oh, good. We had a good time.

06:31.724 --> 06:34.185
- Only thing is, she's on me how I eat.
- Ah!

06:34.435 --> 06:37.230
Hospital dietitian.
You'd figure her being big on that.

06:37.480 --> 06:40.149
On the other hand, you know,
the circumstances on how we met,

06:40.233 --> 06:42.318
she's concerned how my scar's healing.

06:42.402 --> 06:46.239
Yeah? Well, that should be
a natural icebreaker, huh?

06:47.407 --> 06:48.741
<i>Report of a 10-30 at video store,</i>

06:49.075 --> 06:50.576
<i>Third Street at Avenue C.</i>

06:50.910 --> 06:53.329
<i>White male, black leather jacket.
15 Adam.</i>

06:53.454 --> 06:54.622
OFFICER 1
<i>Fifteen Adam responding.</i>

06:55.248 --> 06:56.457
That's right around the corner.

06:56.582 --> 06:57.667
OFFICER 2
<i>Fifteen Charlie responding.</i>

06:58.042 --> 06:59.794
Fifteenth Squad also responding.

07:00.461 --> 07:02.171
- It's time to get back on the horse, huh?
- Yeah.

07:02.672 --> 07:04.674
They got other units responding.
You wanna bag it?

07:04.674 --> 07:06.426
- Now, let's do it. Come on.
- All right.

07:13.891 --> 07:15.518
Yo! Right here! Right here!
What happened?

07:15.726 --> 07:17.770
Sucker tried to pull a holdup on me
and he ran out.

07:17.937 --> 07:20.231
- Did he have a gun?
- Yes! I don't know! But he had his hands

07:20.398 --> 07:22.817
in his jacket. He said give me the money
and he wouldn't shoot me,

07:23.276 --> 07:24.652
- and I wouldn't do it.
- You can get yourself killed that way.

07:24.944 --> 07:26.654
Look, I don't think
he had a gun, all right?

07:26.779 --> 07:28.573
I said, "Show me the gun.
You want the money,

07:28.739 --> 07:31.159
- "you show me the gun." The guy ran out.
- Did he have a car?

07:31.159 --> 07:33.578
No. I didn't see one.
Can you describe him?

07:33.744 --> 07:36.998
Yes. Tall, skinny, white guy,
stringy blond hair, leather jacket.

07:37.165 --> 07:38.666
He was kind of repulsive actually.
Go on.

07:39.125 --> 07:40.126
I don't believe this!
I don't believe this!

07:40.251 --> 07:41.627
What?
- There's the guy, right there!

07:41.711 --> 07:42.712
He's coming out of the Korean market!

07:42.879 --> 07:46.674
Police! Hold it! Stop!

07:46.966 --> 07:49.051
Freeze right there!
Hey! Stop the car!

07:49.552 --> 07:51.679
- Police!
- Freeze! Stop the car!

07:52.096 --> 07:53.973
- Put your hands on your head!
- Out of the car!

07:54.515 --> 07:56.392
Out of the cab.
What are you talking about?

07:56.476 --> 07:59.645
What are you doing? I don't know this guy!
I'm just a cabdriver, man!

08:00.021 --> 08:01.981
Get back in the car. Sit still.
Got no weapons.

08:02.940 --> 08:05.568
What are these? Credit card receipts, huh?
What are you doing with 'em?

08:05.902 --> 08:07.528
You got the right to keep silent.

08:07.987 --> 08:09.906
- What?
- Nothing.

08:10.239 --> 08:12.033
Your badge is melting, man.

08:12.783 --> 08:14.494
- Very good.
- Your badge is melting.

08:14.702 --> 08:16.204
Hey, go figure.
Funny guy, huh?

08:16.913 --> 08:18.164
Better living through pharmacy.

08:18.164 --> 08:19.332
Let's go.

08:43.272 --> 08:46.108
I am very sorry. We are not open yet.

08:46.817 --> 08:50.446
- We're detectives with the 15th Squad.
- Yes? What is it?

08:50.905 --> 08:53.115
- Are you the owner, Mr...
- Mukhopadhyay. Yes, I am.

08:53.241 --> 08:55.535
- Is there some problem?
- Something's happened to your wife.

08:55.785 --> 08:57.537
Something's happened? What do you mean?

08:58.037 --> 08:59.830
Well, she was attacked
on the way over here.

09:00.122 --> 09:02.917
Attacked? Is she all right?
She was very badly hurt.

09:03.292 --> 09:06.379
Somebody strangled her. She's dead.

09:09.006 --> 09:12.176
- You mean Neera, my wife?
- I'm afraid so, sir. We're very sorry.

09:13.010 --> 09:16.806
I find this impossible to believe.
She was coming to eat with us.

09:17.056 --> 09:19.016
Those... are our children.

09:20.476 --> 09:21.811
I'm afraid I can't...

09:22.770 --> 09:24.772
comprehend this without seeing my wife.

09:25.314 --> 09:28.526
- It could be some mistake has been made.
- Well, you can see her, of course.

09:28.985 --> 09:31.529
You want some water or something?
You wanna sit down?

09:31.862 --> 09:33.281
No.

09:33.739 --> 09:35.741
Either of you have any problems
where somebody could have done this?

09:35.866 --> 09:37.618
No.
- Any enemies?

09:38.327 --> 09:39.954
- No, sir.
- No kind of animosity

09:39.954 --> 09:43.165
back in your homeland?
Somebody in India's got it in for you?

09:44.625 --> 09:47.712
No. I need to sit down.
It's fine. Why don't you do that?

09:51.007 --> 09:53.134
May we continue
this conversation later?

09:53.968 --> 09:55.845
Sure. Why don't you come down
to the station house?

09:55.970 --> 09:58.180
Yes, but first I'd like
to talk to my children.

10:02.393 --> 10:05.062
- What do you got, guys?
- That female DOA, Lieu,

10:05.479 --> 10:07.523
- that's a homicide.
- Indian woman.

10:08.190 --> 10:11.402
Manual strangulation. Got bite marks
on both her hands.

10:11.944 --> 10:14.030
- Any sign of sexual assault?
- No. Uh-uh.

10:14.405 --> 10:16.782
And it wasn't a robbery.
She had her money on her.

10:16.907 --> 10:18.159
We notified the husband.

10:18.409 --> 10:20.244
We wouldn't swear on it, but he don't feel
like a candidate.

10:20.536 --> 10:23.039
Any idea if the wife had a lover?
Something the husband said.

10:23.164 --> 10:25.124
The family was gonna eat
together at the restaurant.

10:25.249 --> 10:27.793
But she didn't want to bring
in the kids with her like she usually did.

10:27.960 --> 10:30.046
She wanted the husband to take the kids
with him when he came in earlier.

10:30.254 --> 10:33.090
- The husband say why she did that?
- Said she had to run errands.

10:33.215 --> 10:35.926
We'll talk to the kids some more,
see was the mother away a lot.

10:36.010 --> 10:38.512
- But I don't think there was a boyfriend.
- What are you basing that on?

10:38.929 --> 10:39.930
On the fact that in India,

10:40.056 --> 10:42.266
these women throw themselves
on their husband's funeral piles.

10:42.433 --> 10:43.434
Still?

10:45.603 --> 10:46.979
Anything off canvass?

10:47.772 --> 10:50.399
- Yeah, we gotta go back out there.
- Okay. Keep me posted.

10:55.655 --> 10:58.240
How do we know her father
didn't welsh on the dowry?

10:58.449 --> 11:01.619
Maybe she was seen eating
on one of those fast days or something.

11:01.869 --> 11:04.580
- Oh...
- Anybody hear a dog howling?

11:05.289 --> 11:07.375
I don't find that especially funny.

11:11.504 --> 11:12.880
Detective Squad.

11:13.547 --> 11:15.174
How about that haircut, huh?

11:15.466 --> 11:17.968
It's like Rod Steiger
in one of them Roman movies.

11:18.135 --> 11:19.929
Yeah, yeah. How do you spell that?

11:28.646 --> 11:30.356
Anything on that investigate DOA?

11:30.481 --> 11:33.693
Looks like an OD, Lieu.
Hospital cop at Bellevue

11:33.818 --> 11:36.821
found him against the wall off the side
of the emergency room entrance.

11:37.029 --> 11:38.781
People thought it was
a homeless guy sleeping.

11:38.989 --> 11:40.449
He might have been there
for a little while.

11:40.616 --> 11:42.535
We found his address
off a welfare ID card.

11:42.660 --> 11:44.912
Left a note for the next of kin
to contact the squad.

11:45.037 --> 11:47.039
Okay. Write it up
and notify Missing Persons.

11:47.373 --> 11:48.582
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

11:52.628 --> 11:54.672
Let's go, Marv. Get up. Come on.

11:56.340 --> 11:58.592
Come on out. Let's go.

12:00.636 --> 12:02.847
Sit down. Sit down.
Don't wander. Sit down.

12:03.931 --> 12:06.058
What the hell were you doing
holding up two stores across

12:06.183 --> 12:09.145
- the street from each other?
- I'm just goofing.

12:09.895 --> 12:12.523
Well, good luck with that story
when you go up in front of a judge.

12:12.857 --> 12:15.234
- What are you on, Marvin?
- Marv.

12:15.484 --> 12:17.361
And what were you doing
with all those credit card receipts?

12:18.904 --> 12:21.115
- The flimsies?
- That's what they call 'em?

12:21.323 --> 12:25.244
- What were you doing with them?
- You wanna know what your trouble is?

12:26.203 --> 12:28.247
You're in a comic book.

12:28.372 --> 12:31.000
Hey, Marv, you know,
you're looking at jail time.

12:31.333 --> 12:34.420
Now, maybe you can buy acid in there,
but I bet they're lousy trips.

12:34.712 --> 12:36.630
You got a way to help yourself,
you ought to use it.

12:36.881 --> 12:38.507
Yeah, tell us about those credit card
flimsies, Marvin.

12:39.675 --> 12:41.218
It's just a cartoon.

12:43.387 --> 12:45.556
All right. Try and sit still awhile, Marv.

12:46.432 --> 12:49.185
And try and get in a landing pattern.
Okay?

13:02.031 --> 13:03.741
Hey, I got a jacket for you, man.

13:04.241 --> 13:06.243
- I don't want a jacket.
- Come on, I'll give it to you cheap.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.788
See this? I don't want your jacket.
All right?

13:09.538 --> 13:11.624
- Were you here this morning?
- No, I wasn't here.

13:12.082 --> 13:13.876
You weren't here this morning?
- No, I wasn't here.

13:14.376 --> 13:16.295
- Mm-hmm.
- Look, I'll give it to you cheap, man.

13:16.295 --> 13:18.047
Eight bucks.
I don't want your jacket.

13:19.381 --> 13:21.008
Are we gonna have to bust you
for this grass?

13:21.550 --> 13:23.385
Come on, man. That's nothing but a memory.

13:23.761 --> 13:25.638
All right then. I don't wanna hear
any lies, all right?

13:26.388 --> 13:28.641
Now, all this stuff was on the sidewalk
here this morning

13:28.766 --> 13:29.809
when the cops were here.

13:30.142 --> 13:31.852
I didn't see you anywhere.
You take a hike?

13:34.313 --> 13:36.982
- I don't like cops.
- You don't like cops, huh?

13:37.274 --> 13:40.444
- I'm gonna have to take your ass in.
- What for, man? Why?

13:40.653 --> 13:42.863
I hate this stinking town, man!
I can't do no business!

13:43.113 --> 13:44.156
Chill out! Chill out!

13:45.658 --> 13:48.536
Somebody left a black BMW
over there this morning.

13:48.828 --> 13:51.038
- You see who it was?
- Yeah. A guy parked it.

13:51.914 --> 13:54.667
He had something inside.
He was pulling it around.

13:55.251 --> 13:57.211
- Then he took off running.
- What did he look like?

13:57.378 --> 14:00.673
A young guy. Not a big guy.

14:01.632 --> 14:04.718
He had dark skin.
He had a white shirt on, I think.

14:05.052 --> 14:08.055
- Dark skin. How dark? A Black guy?
- No, not like that.

14:08.639 --> 14:09.723
Like a guy from India.

14:11.225 --> 14:12.476
How old do you think he was?

14:14.228 --> 14:16.188
- Twenties?
- You never seen him before?

14:16.981 --> 14:18.649
- No.
- You ever over by those

14:18.649 --> 14:20.609
Indian restaurants over on Sixth street?

14:21.527 --> 14:23.237
- Some.
- You ever seen him over there?

14:23.237 --> 14:25.531
- Never saw him before.
- What's your name?

14:25.781 --> 14:27.533
- Give me your name.
- Chico, man!

14:27.533 --> 14:29.451
Now the guy's gonna come looking for me!

14:29.827 --> 14:33.873
- Give me your name.
- Art Hutado.

14:34.164 --> 14:37.084
You always around this area here, huh?
All the time.

14:37.960 --> 14:39.920
All right. Here's a few bucks, Art. Thanks.

14:41.589 --> 14:43.257
Hey, you gonna come back looking for me?

14:44.633 --> 14:46.427
To make an ID if we collar the guy, yeah.

14:46.719 --> 14:49.054
Well, it's gonna take more
than three bucks the next time.

14:49.138 --> 14:50.556
That's just sticking-around money.

14:50.806 --> 14:53.559
There'll be more in it for you
if we bring the guy back to ID.

14:53.726 --> 14:55.686
- All right?
- All right, <i>mi capitán.</i>

14:55.853 --> 14:57.021
You bring him around,
I'll ID the hell outta him!

14:58.606 --> 15:00.274
At least we know it was an Indian guy.

15:00.900 --> 15:04.278
Now, all's we need to figure out
is which blood cult he belongs to.

15:21.420 --> 15:24.757
Yeah. I got this note left on my door.

15:25.049 --> 15:27.635
It says I should contact
the Detective Squad here.

15:27.927 --> 15:30.262
- What's your name?
- Crawford Green.

15:31.096 --> 15:33.349
- Uh-huh.
- I'm Detective Russell.

15:34.516 --> 15:36.810
I got this note said I should come in.

15:36.894 --> 15:38.979
- Is something the matter?
- Why don't you come with me?

15:45.361 --> 15:46.987
Right in here. Adrienne.

15:49.198 --> 15:51.867
This is Detective Lesniak.
Why don't you have a seat?

15:52.326 --> 15:53.786
What's going on?

15:55.162 --> 15:56.580
Are you related to Cecil Green?

15:56.956 --> 15:58.457
I'm staying with him. That's my son.

16:00.501 --> 16:04.672
Sorry to have to tell you this, Mr. Green.
Um, your son was found dead.

16:05.798 --> 16:08.676
- Cecil died?
- From a drug overdose.

16:10.219 --> 16:12.262
Oh. Oh!

16:16.767 --> 16:18.727
Did you know your son was using heroin?

16:20.688 --> 16:22.773
I knew he was doing something.

16:24.483 --> 16:28.529
- When did you see him last?
- This morning before he went out.

16:29.405 --> 16:33.200
Somebody, uh, dumped him
on the sidewalk outside Bellevue.

16:35.035 --> 16:36.912
Son of a bitch!

16:37.955 --> 16:39.039
Dumped him?

16:39.581 --> 16:42.918
- That son of a bitch just dumped him?
- Who are we talking about?

16:43.002 --> 16:45.170
That son of a bitch was supposed
to take him in the hospital

16:45.462 --> 16:46.505
and get him treated.

16:47.006 --> 16:51.176
- He just left Cecil out there to die.
- Who? What's the guy's name that did it?

16:52.469 --> 16:53.679
Lionel McKinney.

16:54.221 --> 16:56.724
Son of a bitch said he was gonna
take Cecil to the hospital.

16:57.266 --> 16:59.351
Said he was gonna take him
and get him treated.

16:59.601 --> 17:00.686
- Were you there?
- Uh...

17:02.646 --> 17:05.232
Lionel phoned me
and told me what happened.

17:06.066 --> 17:08.610
He said he was taking Cecil
to the hospital.

17:09.361 --> 17:12.740
Now, I want that son of a bitch
arrested for what he done.

17:13.032 --> 17:15.242
- That's... that's homicide.
- I'm sorry, Mr. Green.

17:15.242 --> 17:17.161
There really isn't any law
that says you have

17:17.286 --> 17:18.495
to take somebody to a hospital.

17:20.497 --> 17:22.207
Then get him on all the fencing he do.

17:23.292 --> 17:26.086
This Lionel's a fence?
Sure he's a fence.

17:26.295 --> 17:29.548
He move all kind of stolen jewelry, guns.

17:30.007 --> 17:31.675
He'll sell a gun to anybody kids.

17:31.925 --> 17:35.179
It don't matter to him.
He moves stuff from big jobs.

17:35.304 --> 17:37.765
Yeah. He works for Jimmy Tibaldi.

17:39.308 --> 17:40.392
You sure about that?

17:40.726 --> 17:43.020
That son of a bitch move
all kind of stuff for Tibaldi.

17:43.771 --> 17:47.649
He sells out of his van.
Usually on 13th Street.

17:47.858 --> 17:50.569
Yeah, right down there
next to First Avenue.

17:51.320 --> 17:54.198
All right, Mr. Green. Do you have a number
where we can reach you?

17:54.573 --> 17:57.659
Yeah. You let me know when
you pick that son of a bitch up.

17:58.243 --> 18:00.454
The reason I need your number
is to let you know when

18:00.579 --> 18:03.290
your son's body will be released.
Leave that other matter to us, all right?

18:05.167 --> 18:06.585
Lionel McKinney!

18:07.878 --> 18:12.299
There's nothing you do to him
that's gonna be bad enough to suit me.

18:13.175 --> 18:14.176
I understand.

18:23.018 --> 18:25.020
- The next of kin on your DOA?
- Yeah.

18:25.521 --> 18:27.356
He says his son was mixed up
with a fence.

18:27.523 --> 18:28.899
Sells guns out of his car.

18:29.233 --> 18:31.485
He said the fence works for Jimmy Tibaldi.

18:31.693 --> 18:33.987
- We could try to buy into this guy.
- Everyone's on cases.

18:34.154 --> 18:36.365
- I don't have any backup.
- I can get backup from Anti-Crime.

18:38.117 --> 18:39.326
Yeah. All right.

18:39.660 --> 18:41.537
All right. You got some
kind of outfit in your locker?

18:41.537 --> 18:43.580
Mm-hmm. I'll make it look good. Okay.

18:43.914 --> 18:46.959
Hey, Lieu, we lost both
of our stickup complaints.

18:47.084 --> 18:49.378
That video boss's clerk
didn't want her to bother with it.

18:49.378 --> 18:50.629
And the grocer won't stand up?

18:50.754 --> 18:52.631
Eh, the grocer don't want
to give up the time.

18:52.631 --> 18:55.217
Yeah. He's... he's writing it off
as a stunt by a loony.

18:55.676 --> 18:57.970
- Yeah, that perp is weird.
- Marv. Yeah.

18:58.137 --> 18:59.429
He's loaded on something.

18:59.596 --> 19:02.307
Well, work him
on that credit card receipts

19:02.432 --> 19:03.517
before you void his arrest.

19:03.934 --> 19:05.561
- Maybe he'll give us somebody.
- Okay.

19:05.936 --> 19:07.813
Ten minutes on those guys from Anti-Crime.

19:08.021 --> 19:09.106
For what?

19:09.523 --> 19:11.316
We're gonna buy into a guy
who's selling guns.

19:11.650 --> 19:13.152
- Who is?
- Me and Diane.

19:13.652 --> 19:16.780
- So who's the backup from Anti-Crime?
- Why? Are you writing a book?

19:17.197 --> 19:19.867
- Stone and Simpson.
- No. They're the ones who just

19:19.992 --> 19:21.618
got transferred from Housing.
They're cowboys.

19:21.952 --> 19:22.995
We'll be all right.

19:23.912 --> 19:25.873
- I'm... I'm gonna go with them.
- Yeah, okay.

19:26.206 --> 19:28.417
No, it's not okay. We'll handle it.

19:29.459 --> 19:31.879
Adrienne says the guy's got guns, right?
Something could happen, Diane.

19:32.045 --> 19:34.590
And I said don't worry about it.
Take care of your own case.

19:35.924 --> 19:38.051
Lieu, the backup
they have is totally lame.

19:38.594 --> 19:40.721
Our guy hasn't come in yet
for questioning so, uh...

19:40.846 --> 19:43.974
Can I help you?
- Yes. My name is Mukhopadhyay.

19:44.474 --> 19:46.810
- Good luck with me pronouncing that.
- Whoa, hey.

19:46.977 --> 19:49.354
Uh, we'll be right with you in a minute.

19:49.897 --> 19:53.901
Uh, you know, we could go, boss.
An hour don't mean nothing to this Marvin.

19:55.569 --> 19:58.113
Look, Medavoy and Martinez will back you.

19:59.239 --> 20:02.159
- Anybody got a problem with that?
- No problem.

20:05.913 --> 20:07.539
I'll call it off at Anti-Crime.

20:10.584 --> 20:13.253
- Should we pick up the van?
- It's at the borough.

20:19.384 --> 20:21.470
- You all right with him?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

20:23.639 --> 20:25.599
We can talk in here.

20:26.016 --> 20:27.643
Why don't you have the kids
wait here on the bench?

20:28.018 --> 20:30.729
She'll keep an eye on 'em.

20:38.445 --> 20:41.114
- Bobby, get out of here.
- What are you getting pissed off for?

20:41.281 --> 20:43.575
- Are you kidding me?
- Diane, we back each other up on this job.

20:43.742 --> 20:45.953
You're not trying to back me up.
You're trying to wrap me up

20:46.119 --> 20:47.996
'cause we're sleeping together.
I'm not gonna work that way.

20:48.205 --> 20:50.249
Stop talking to me like
all we got going here is sex!

20:50.499 --> 20:52.584
Look, if you got a problem
with me wanting to make sure

20:52.668 --> 20:53.794
you got some decent backup,

20:53.794 --> 20:55.420
then somebody's gonna
have to transfer out of here.

20:55.671 --> 20:58.006
Well, I guess we're gonna need
to have that conversation.

20:58.257 --> 21:00.634
But right now, I'm gonna go do my job.
Get out of here so I can change.

21:23.573 --> 21:25.158
- You all right?
- Yes.

21:25.284 --> 21:28.287
- I'm just waiting for that detective.
- Good.

21:29.121 --> 21:32.791
- Lieutenant, I found my backrest.
- Good.

21:33.083 --> 21:34.876
It was way under my desk. Good.

21:35.210 --> 21:38.297
Is that something that
bald detective would do?

21:38.964 --> 21:41.425
Detective Sipowicz?
No, I wouldn't think so.

21:41.967 --> 21:43.593
Because he has a smart mouth.

21:44.219 --> 21:46.054
Well, I'm glad you found it.

21:50.142 --> 21:51.685
I'm gonna have trouble
with your name.

21:52.060 --> 21:55.022
- Mukhopadhyay.
- Moko...

21:55.355 --> 21:57.941
- Mukhopadhyay.
- Mukhopadhyay.

21:59.401 --> 22:00.444
Very good.

22:01.028 --> 22:02.904
Don't get insulted if I mess up.

22:03.238 --> 22:05.073
And I gotta ask you some blunt questions.

22:05.282 --> 22:08.410
- I hope you don't take offense.
- What questions?

22:10.871 --> 22:13.248
You think your wife could've
been seeing somebody else?

22:13.915 --> 22:16.793
I do take offense. That is an insult
to me and my wife!

22:17.127 --> 22:21.006
I'm just going down the list, Mr...
I'm eliminating possibilities.

22:21.757 --> 22:24.259
So she wasn't spending
a lot of time away from the house?

22:24.551 --> 22:26.303
- Nothing like that?
- Absolutely not.

22:26.553 --> 22:28.347
Course of your business,
do you have any dealings

22:28.347 --> 22:29.848
with the criminal types?

22:30.640 --> 22:32.893
Debts with loan sharks?

22:33.393 --> 22:36.438
- Anyone shaking you down?
- Shaking me down?

22:37.272 --> 22:38.357
Extortion.

22:39.524 --> 22:40.817
We have no bad debts.

22:41.610 --> 22:44.946
We're very well-funded by Mr. Padmanabhan
our investor in Bombay.

22:46.448 --> 22:50.577
You got a beautiful restaurant,
beautiful waitresses too.

22:52.496 --> 22:55.499
- I do not have another woman.
- I didn't say that.

22:55.749 --> 22:57.376
Well, I'm sure it was on your list.

23:10.138 --> 23:13.308
So, uh, she's really after me
about the diet.

23:14.017 --> 23:15.435
- She is, huh?
- Yeah.

23:15.894 --> 23:18.063
Food groups, fat content.

23:18.188 --> 23:19.940
I never knew there was so much to it. Yeah.

23:20.857 --> 23:23.026
We're getting to the age
where we gotta pay attention, huh?

23:23.235 --> 23:25.195
- Yeah.
- I always thought you ate

23:25.195 --> 23:26.363
pretty healthy, James.

23:26.530 --> 23:28.865
Yeah, well, this person's
a professional, this Anita.

23:29.449 --> 23:32.828
I mean, we... we're dating.
But that's how she makes her living.

23:33.620 --> 23:35.831
- Then I guess she'd know.
- Yeah.

23:37.416 --> 23:38.625
She's coming across the street.

23:51.096 --> 23:52.180
What's happening?

23:53.140 --> 23:54.933
Anything you want, baby.
Yeah, anything?

23:55.809 --> 23:56.893
Could be anything.

23:57.477 --> 24:00.230
What's happenin', happenin'?
What kind of thing you lookin' for?

24:00.355 --> 24:01.940
I don't know. Who says I'm lookin'?

24:02.441 --> 24:05.235
Who says I got it?
- If I was looking, should I come to you?

24:06.153 --> 24:08.989
- Be worth a try.
- I got this nutcase followin' me.

24:09.948 --> 24:11.658
Know anywhere I can get some protection?

24:11.783 --> 24:14.286
Something I can put in my purse?
Why you asking me?

24:14.578 --> 24:16.496
'Cause Pepe told me maybe
you got somethin'.

24:17.456 --> 24:18.457
I don't know no Pepe.

24:19.624 --> 24:21.334
A short guy, meaty-looking face?

24:27.257 --> 24:28.800
Let's see what I can do for you.

24:31.887 --> 24:33.263
I'll let you have this for a hundred.

24:33.638 --> 24:36.183
Oh, man! How about 50?

24:36.600 --> 24:39.394
Uh-uh. Hundred. It's a clean piece, baby.

24:39.603 --> 24:41.897
It's good. Ain't never been used.

24:44.149 --> 24:45.150
Yeah, all right.

24:47.194 --> 24:48.320
You want a hundred?

24:48.570 --> 24:50.155
That's it.
Let's go.

24:50.405 --> 24:53.074
Yeah, yeah. Here you go.
All right!

24:53.575 --> 24:55.118
You're under arrest. Put your hands up.

24:55.494 --> 24:56.620
Police! You're under arrest!

24:57.913 --> 24:59.915
- You little bitch!
- Watch your mouth.

25:00.248 --> 25:01.625
Come on. Let's go. Don't move.

25:01.750 --> 25:03.251
You all right?
Yeah.

25:03.418 --> 25:04.461
Let's check the van.

25:17.474 --> 25:20.352
- Do you wanna talk to me now?
- Yeah, I do. Just a second.

25:21.561 --> 25:23.980
Thanks for talking to me, huh? Okay.

25:24.814 --> 25:26.566
You know, maybe we could get him
a soft drink or something

25:26.942 --> 25:28.652
while he waits for his sister and dad.

25:29.027 --> 25:30.445
Where should I tell him to go?

25:33.615 --> 25:35.784
Narain, would you like something to drink?

25:37.702 --> 25:39.996
Okay. Come on, Asha.
Right down there.

25:48.338 --> 25:49.548
You can have a seat right there.

25:58.098 --> 26:00.850
- I know this is a real sad day for you.
- Mm-hmm.

26:05.063 --> 26:06.106
I, uh...

26:07.107 --> 26:10.068
have to ask you some questions,
Asha, so that we can, you know,

26:10.068 --> 26:11.695
try to figure out what happened
to your mother.

26:12.445 --> 26:15.407
But I want you to know
that I'm really sorry for your loss.

26:16.700 --> 26:18.410
What do you have to ask me?

26:19.869 --> 26:25.041
Well, if you could go through everything
that happened at home today, Asha,

26:25.709 --> 26:27.168
before you left with your father.

26:27.669 --> 26:29.254
Just try and say everything
that happened.

26:29.588 --> 26:30.880
Nothing happened.

26:31.673 --> 26:34.009
- Nothing unusual?
- No.

26:35.594 --> 26:38.638
Well, did you usually go with your father
when the family ate at the restaurant?

26:39.598 --> 26:42.350
No. With my mother.

26:42.892 --> 26:45.562
- That was different then, right?
- Yeah.

26:46.229 --> 26:48.732
Your dad told me
that your mom said that...

26:49.357 --> 26:51.860
she had something to do,
but he didn't know what that was.

26:52.235 --> 26:53.486
I don't know either.

26:55.030 --> 26:56.364
Were you and your mom close?

26:57.699 --> 26:59.034
Not so close.

27:00.952 --> 27:02.412
Not close recently, or...

27:08.251 --> 27:09.628
It's, uh...

27:10.795 --> 27:13.423
sad enough to lose your mom,
but then to know

27:13.673 --> 27:16.176
that you can't ever straighten out
the things between you.

27:18.261 --> 27:19.471
I don't know.

27:20.138 --> 27:21.931
What do you think your mother
had to do, Asha?

27:23.183 --> 27:24.768
Why do you think she had to be alone?

27:26.227 --> 27:29.064
I think she wanted to talk to Jatin.

27:31.483 --> 27:32.651
Jatin, the houseboy?

27:33.234 --> 27:35.570
- She was very angry with him.
- Why?

27:38.365 --> 27:40.617
She was looking in his belongings.

27:41.660 --> 27:45.205
- I don't think she should've done that.
- What did she find that made her angry?

27:46.539 --> 27:47.540
I don't know.

27:51.044 --> 27:53.171
Was it this morning that
she was looking through his things?

27:54.089 --> 27:55.256
Last night.

27:55.757 --> 27:57.217
She found my picture.

27:58.176 --> 28:01.012
Hmm. And how'd he get your picture?

28:01.805 --> 28:03.139
He asked me for it.

28:06.184 --> 28:07.352
Is Jatin your boyfriend?

28:08.770 --> 28:09.854
I don't know.

28:10.522 --> 28:11.606
You like him a lot?

28:13.608 --> 28:15.110
Does he feel the same way about you?

28:20.281 --> 28:22.158
Does Jatin ever drive your mother around?

28:22.867 --> 28:25.620
No. He can't drive.

28:26.162 --> 28:27.497
Does he have his own house key?

28:28.456 --> 28:30.792
My mother didn't want him
coming and going.

28:31.751 --> 28:33.378
She wanted him at the house.

28:34.921 --> 28:38.383
- Does Jatin have a bad temper?
- No.

28:41.469 --> 28:43.596
If he ever lost his temper,
you think he could've done

28:43.680 --> 28:44.848
something to hurt your mother?

28:45.849 --> 28:48.727
I don't know. I hope not.

28:51.980 --> 28:54.691
My mother wanted me
to marry Mr. Padmanabhan.

28:55.692 --> 28:57.610
He's the investor in our restaurant.

28:59.529 --> 29:01.489
He's 35 years old.

29:10.874 --> 29:12.292
All right, Asha. Just have a seat.

29:13.585 --> 29:16.546
Thanks for talking to me, all right?
Your dad will be here in a minute.

29:16.546 --> 29:18.882
You tricked me
into selling you that piece.

29:19.799 --> 29:22.844
It wasn't even for sale.
I had it for my own protection.

29:22.969 --> 29:25.013
What about the other four guns?
They for protection too?

29:25.430 --> 29:27.640
That was an illegal search,
and you know it.

29:28.224 --> 29:30.310
We oughta get back in
with our stickup guy.

29:30.310 --> 29:31.728
Thanks for your help. Yeah.

29:32.604 --> 29:34.189
Thanks, James.
Yeah, anytime.

29:34.397 --> 29:35.398
You know Cecil Green?

29:36.900 --> 29:38.777
Why? What about Cecil?

29:39.402 --> 29:41.946
- Oh, that's what this is about?
- So you guys collared up, huh?

29:42.030 --> 29:44.115
Come on, Lionel.
- We're gonna go process the guy now.

29:44.240 --> 29:46.826
- You think we can handle that?
- All right. Let me up, Diane.

29:46.993 --> 29:48.077
Look, if I overreacted,

29:48.328 --> 29:50.038
it was because I was worried
about what could happen.

29:50.038 --> 29:51.956
You were disrespectful to me
in front of the squad.

29:52.457 --> 29:54.292
You made us look like jerks to the boss...

29:56.920 --> 29:59.422
Which we're doing more of now. Yeah.

29:59.589 --> 30:01.049
- I'll talk to you later.
- All right.

30:01.341 --> 30:04.052
Thanks for coming down,
Mr. Mukhopadhyay.

30:08.807 --> 30:10.683
So Wendy says you might like the houseboy?

30:11.434 --> 30:13.478
Yeah. Yeah, we're gonna pick him up.

30:14.354 --> 30:17.565
- Find me before you go home.
- Okay, Lieu.

30:22.237 --> 30:24.989
- Oh, that's a jackpot.
- Over you and Russell?

30:25.573 --> 30:28.201
Yeah, I should've just kept my mouth shut
about this backup deal.

30:29.410 --> 30:32.288
I tried to teach you tact.
I just can't get through.

30:36.584 --> 30:38.211
You ready, Marv?

30:39.170 --> 30:41.005
I'm back. I'm better.

30:41.172 --> 30:43.758
You're better? Get your mind set
on what's happening here.

30:44.008 --> 30:45.093
You're looking at time.

30:45.260 --> 30:47.095
The DA's coming down
on these credit card rip-offs.

30:47.720 --> 30:50.682
I'm just a gofer,
and I mean that literally.

30:51.015 --> 30:52.225
Well, who do you gofer for?

30:52.892 --> 30:56.312
Ah... This, uh, Russian guy.

30:56.479 --> 31:00.149
Um, Sergei... something or other.

31:00.358 --> 31:03.945
Uh, he's hanging his dream life
on plastic, you know?

31:04.696 --> 31:06.823
And me, I just run a few errands.

31:07.240 --> 31:09.409
- You buy the flimsies?
- Yeah.

31:09.868 --> 31:13.121
Yeah, that's all I do. Uh, I get around.

31:13.955 --> 31:17.917
I'm easy. I'm good with people.
I've got waitresses, bartenders.

31:18.334 --> 31:21.921
They sell me good numbers,
and then I turn them over to Sergei.

31:22.422 --> 31:23.506
What's he do with them?

31:23.923 --> 31:26.050
He's got cards
that he's bought from a fence.

31:27.594 --> 31:29.929
Stolen, see? And they're no good,

31:30.305 --> 31:32.140
because they've already been reported.

31:32.515 --> 31:38.146
He transfers numbers
from the flimsies I give him,

31:38.897 --> 31:43.026
onto the cards...
because my numbers are still good.

31:43.443 --> 31:45.778
How does he make the transfer?
He takes the cards

31:45.862 --> 31:49.032
and puts them in a microwave
and zaps them with big amps.

31:49.490 --> 31:52.201
The cards get soft,
and the numbers go flat.

31:52.535 --> 31:55.455
And then he's got this gizmo thing,
and he puts cards in,

31:55.705 --> 31:58.917
and he cranks the handle, and bingo.

31:59.584 --> 32:01.628
So he gets the numbers off your flimsies?

32:03.463 --> 32:05.340
And then my man Sergei hops a plane,

32:05.548 --> 32:09.594
checks himself into a four-star hotel
and hits the good stores.

32:09.928 --> 32:13.681
- So, Sergei, he really exists?
- Well, yeah.

32:14.182 --> 32:17.435
We're gonna need his address.
That's not such a good idea,

32:17.644 --> 32:19.103
because, you know, the cat's paranoid.

32:19.187 --> 32:21.189
He'll probably burn up the cards
before you get in.

32:21.564 --> 32:25.318
You know, he's got his lighter fluid
and the little pots ready.

32:25.443 --> 32:28.446
Yeah. See, that... that would come under
the category of "our problem," Marv.

32:29.614 --> 32:32.450
If you can give up an address
and it's good for Sergei,

32:32.742 --> 32:35.745
then, um, you can walk
out of here or fly

32:35.995 --> 32:38.289
or whatever's your chosen
means of, uh, transport.

32:41.584 --> 32:42.835
Sounds like a plan.

32:59.227 --> 33:00.269
Go.

33:01.771 --> 33:04.190
Hey! What the...
Police! Police! Hey!

33:04.482 --> 33:07.652
What the hell?
- Hey, Jesus! Stop! Get over here!

33:08.236 --> 33:10.405
Whatever it is,
I got nothing to do with it.

33:10.863 --> 33:11.948
I got him.
You live here?

33:11.948 --> 33:13.700
No, I don't live here.
I just came up for ten minutes.

33:14.075 --> 33:15.243
I don't know him from Adam.

33:15.368 --> 33:17.120
Put your pants on.
I've done nothing.

33:17.328 --> 33:19.664
Hey, can I go?
Get outta here.

33:20.665 --> 33:22.625
You persecute me
because I'm a Russian, right?

33:22.709 --> 33:25.211
Hey, one of my grandmothers
was Russian, pal.

33:25.628 --> 33:27.422
We persecute you
for stealing credit cards.

33:27.672 --> 33:31.134
- I have done nothing, I told you.
- Nothing, huh? What's this?

33:31.551 --> 33:33.511
What does this look like? Come on.

33:46.983 --> 33:49.902
How long you been
with the Mukhopadhyay family?

33:51.487 --> 33:53.906
I came with them to this country
three years ago.

33:54.532 --> 33:56.826
Before that, I worked for them
three years in Bombay.

33:57.535 --> 33:59.370
- How old are you?
- Eighteen.

33:59.871 --> 34:01.539
You've been working with them
since you were 12?

34:02.790 --> 34:04.667
- They treat you all right?
- Yes.

34:05.460 --> 34:07.378
Mr. Mukhopadhyay has been very good to me.

34:07.795 --> 34:10.298
- How about his wife?
- Yes. She also.

34:10.590 --> 34:12.467
You have an argument
with her this morning?

34:12.467 --> 34:13.593
No.

34:13.801 --> 34:15.803
Look, Jatin we already know
about you having Asha's picture.

34:16.345 --> 34:18.431
Her mother was real mad at you
about that, wasn't she?

34:18.806 --> 34:21.934
- I agreed to return it.
- You sort of in love with Asha?

34:23.019 --> 34:25.354
No. She's like my little sister.

34:25.480 --> 34:27.440
Then why didn't her mother
want you to have her picture?

34:28.441 --> 34:29.734
Because I'm a servant.

34:29.984 --> 34:33.237
- She thought it was presumptuous.
- That piss you off, Jatin?

34:35.031 --> 34:38.451
- I don't understand.
- It means you got mad and you killed her.

34:38.451 --> 34:39.577
You understand that?

34:42.914 --> 34:45.958
I am very upset. I prefer to be silent.

34:46.084 --> 34:48.920
All right. Look, Jatin, we are gonna have
the dentist that works

34:48.920 --> 34:51.923
with the police department come over here
and make a cast of your teeth.

34:52.507 --> 34:55.009
- I don't agree to that.
- Well, it's not up to you.

34:55.259 --> 34:58.179
We'll get a court order. And if he has to,
he'll give you an anesthetic.

34:58.346 --> 35:01.974
Mrs. Mukhopadhyay had bite marks
on both of her hands.

35:02.225 --> 35:05.686
We gotta make a cast of your teeth, Jatin,
so we can check it against those marks.

35:05.853 --> 35:08.231
We also have a witness
that saw you running

35:08.231 --> 35:09.732
from the car where we found the body.

35:09.899 --> 35:12.527
We're gonna have that witness
come in and take a look at you.

35:15.404 --> 35:16.614
Can't someone help me?

35:16.906 --> 35:18.533
We're it. We're the help you're gonna get.

35:20.827 --> 35:21.911
How'd you learn how to drive?

35:22.286 --> 35:24.038
You do know how to drive a little,
don't you?

35:25.414 --> 35:27.834
A friend showed me how to operate his car.

35:28.417 --> 35:30.378
One time, he let me drive a little way.

35:30.962 --> 35:32.964
We were coming back from the movies.

35:33.214 --> 35:35.216
What did Mrs. Mukhopadhyay
say to you this morning?

35:36.134 --> 35:39.720
To pack my things.
She was going to send me back to India.

35:40.012 --> 35:42.181
- She can do that?
- Yes.

35:43.724 --> 35:46.853
My visa is to stay only if I work
for the Mukhopadhyays.

35:47.895 --> 35:50.064
I would go back to India in disgrace.

35:50.940 --> 35:52.942
I would never see the family again.

35:53.693 --> 35:55.194
Any of the family members.

35:56.821 --> 36:00.116
I felt it was most unfair
and heartless what she was doing to me.

36:00.658 --> 36:03.828
I was very hurt.
I have nothing but the family.

36:04.328 --> 36:07.498
How could she take away
everything from me just for a photo?

36:08.583 --> 36:12.086
She wished to send me away
before Mr. Mukhopadhyay found out.

36:13.629 --> 36:15.256
She was going to call
for the plane ticket.

36:16.174 --> 36:17.341
I begged her not to.

36:19.510 --> 36:21.470
She was screaming at me
and slapping me.

36:22.889 --> 36:24.974
I bit her hands to try and stop her.

36:26.392 --> 36:27.602
I lost control.

36:28.644 --> 36:30.062
I took hold of her neck.

36:31.939 --> 36:33.024
I choked her.

36:34.150 --> 36:35.985
I didn't realize for how long I did that.

36:37.904 --> 36:39.280
I don't understand it.

36:45.286 --> 36:47.955
I've always been afraid
of Mrs. Mukhopadhyay.

36:53.085 --> 36:55.588
You know how to drive well enough
to put that body in the car...

36:55.880 --> 36:57.465
and then drive away from the house, right?

36:58.424 --> 37:00.676
I wanted it... to appear

37:01.344 --> 37:04.388
that someone got in the car
maybe to steal something.

37:04.639 --> 37:06.891
I put her purse in, and shoes too.

37:08.434 --> 37:11.103
I only got about three blocks
before I stalled.

37:11.229 --> 37:13.981
Yeah. If you were trying
to make it look like a robbery though,

37:14.106 --> 37:15.691
why didn't you take
the money out of her purse?

37:16.400 --> 37:18.110
I couldn't steal from the family.

37:18.444 --> 37:20.863
And then you took the keys
to get back in the house.

37:21.656 --> 37:22.907
I have no house key.

37:23.366 --> 37:25.076
Why did you lock the car, Jatin?

37:26.494 --> 37:27.495
I don't know.

37:29.163 --> 37:30.206
A precaution.

37:30.623 --> 37:35.294
Otherwise someone could get in,
perhaps steal something.

37:41.676 --> 37:44.720
- First day in the piggy bank.
- Yeah. Good night, Evelyn.

37:45.096 --> 37:47.473
- Don't let me find out it was you.
- What?

37:48.975 --> 37:50.476
I think we understand each other.

37:52.603 --> 37:54.563
Houseboy gave it up, Lieu.
He's writing up a statement.

37:54.939 --> 37:56.691
Sounded like the kid just snapped.

37:56.983 --> 37:59.360
He was in love with the daughter,
so the mother was trying to break 'em up.

37:59.568 --> 38:01.821
Yeah? Ever work one of those before, Andy?

38:02.321 --> 38:05.032
Yeah. I guess it wasn't a strong element
of the supernatural.

38:05.658 --> 38:08.327
Let me call Mr. uh, Mukhopadhyay.

38:10.621 --> 38:11.664
Bobby?

38:14.000 --> 38:15.167
Mm-hmm.

38:22.091 --> 38:23.926
- You know what this is about?
- Yep.

38:25.386 --> 38:27.513
Lesniak and Russell had adequate backup.

38:27.930 --> 38:30.141
Besides Anti-Crime,
I notified the sector cars.

38:30.266 --> 38:32.852
I didn't know that,
but I was out of line though.

38:33.060 --> 38:35.146
Meaning I don't have to make
the general point, which is,

38:35.271 --> 38:36.689
you don't get to second-guess assignments.

38:37.189 --> 38:38.607
- Uh-huh.
- If she's doing her job,

38:38.691 --> 38:39.859
she's gonna be at risk.

38:40.026 --> 38:43.112
If it upsets you to see that,
then make a different arrangement.

38:43.696 --> 38:45.281
There's a lot of precincts in this city.

38:50.286 --> 38:51.287
I hear you.

38:59.378 --> 39:01.339
- Are my fives okay?
- Yeah.

39:07.053 --> 39:09.305
- It's hard, huh?
- Yeah.

39:10.348 --> 39:13.476
I mean, I'm no authority
for successful relationships on the job.

39:13.809 --> 39:16.145
- Is anybody?
- You and me work another shift together,

39:16.145 --> 39:17.646
people will say we're an item.

39:17.980 --> 39:21.650
- Yeah. I got no time for what people say.
- Hmm.

39:26.238 --> 39:27.573
You know, um...

39:28.324 --> 39:31.702
I had Greg tell James I was gay.

39:32.536 --> 39:34.747
Yeah. Yeah, I heard something about that.

39:34.997 --> 39:36.499
You know, I'll tell you the truth.

39:36.499 --> 39:39.085
I thought I said it
so he'd stop asking me out.

39:39.585 --> 39:41.087
And now I started wondering.

39:41.754 --> 39:44.215
I've never been successful
in a relationship.

39:45.383 --> 39:48.844
Are you attracted to other women?

39:50.221 --> 39:52.139
Um, I don't know.

39:54.475 --> 39:55.643
Not consciously.

39:56.727 --> 40:00.689
I don't come from that kind of background,
people talk about that kind of stuff.

40:01.273 --> 40:02.942
My background,
we don't talk about anything.

40:03.651 --> 40:06.570
Yeah. Upstairs John says

40:06.695 --> 40:09.448
maybe I should go to one
of those gay officer meetings.

40:09.865 --> 40:11.033
How do you feel about that?

40:12.827 --> 40:14.453
Would you go if it were you?

40:17.123 --> 40:18.499
Yeah. Yeah, I think I would.

40:19.125 --> 40:21.377
I mean, I'd try to find
the glove that fit, you know?

40:21.794 --> 40:23.045
Yeah.

40:25.089 --> 40:27.133
- There's our guy.
- Okay.

40:31.262 --> 40:33.973
- Thanks for coming back in.
- Did you find Lionel?

40:34.306 --> 40:35.766
Yeah. He's under arrest.

40:36.308 --> 40:38.018
He didn't work for Jimmy Tibaldi though.

40:38.269 --> 40:40.020
He's a street hustler.
He had five cheap guns.

40:40.813 --> 40:43.774
The son of a bitch deserved jail
for what he done to Cecil.

40:43.858 --> 40:46.444
Lionel told us all three of you
were in that apartment.

40:46.735 --> 40:48.779
You were there too
when Cecil got in trouble.

40:48.904 --> 40:49.989
He said that?

40:50.239 --> 40:53.242
Mm-hmm. His story kind
of made sense, Mr. Green.

40:59.415 --> 41:05.671
Well, I checked with the Veterans,
and got his papers in order.

41:05.921 --> 41:07.965
His remains will be released
tomorrow morning.

41:11.719 --> 41:14.221
I went to that hospital
a couple of weeks ago,

41:14.305 --> 41:15.598
and I took something.

41:16.265 --> 41:18.100
That's why I couldn't go.

41:18.642 --> 41:19.643
You were a patient?

41:21.145 --> 41:23.189
No, I had an OD thing.

41:23.606 --> 41:26.400
- It wasn't nothing too bad.
- What did you steal?

41:28.486 --> 41:32.907
There was this cart with some pills
on it the nurses come around with.

41:33.240 --> 41:35.493
And, uh, I was released.

41:36.494 --> 41:39.580
And when she wasn't looking,
I took three of them bottles of pills.

41:39.747 --> 41:44.084
And I knew that they'd
find them bottles missing

41:44.376 --> 41:45.878
and figure I did it.

41:50.090 --> 41:52.843
I carried him... to the car,

41:54.136 --> 41:55.846
but then it was on Lionel.

41:57.515 --> 41:59.850
That son of a bitch just let him down.

42:00.559 --> 42:02.436
How long were you
and your son shooting up?

42:06.398 --> 42:08.234
Ten, 15 years.

42:09.109 --> 42:11.195
It was Cecil who turned me on.

42:13.822 --> 42:15.533
Something we had in common.

42:20.996 --> 42:23.499
Well, it's time now you got
some treatment, Mr. Green.

42:25.376 --> 42:26.418
Yeah.

42:28.254 --> 42:30.422
Only it's too late for it
to do any good now.

42:30.714 --> 42:34.051
No, it can do you some good.
You still got yourself to look after.

42:34.635 --> 42:36.512
Yeah, but that's all I got.

42:39.515 --> 42:42.309
Are... are you gonna
arrest me on something?

42:43.435 --> 42:45.563
No. You can go on home.

42:50.401 --> 42:51.485
Yeah.

42:54.738 --> 42:55.906
I'll go home.

43:19.638 --> 43:22.600
- I don't want you to transfer out.
- I don't want to.

43:24.226 --> 43:26.729
So we have another beef.
Where you putting in for?

43:31.942 --> 43:34.028
Look, it just took me by surprise.
That's all.

43:34.194 --> 43:37.114
It's... You were about ready
to go out on the street.

43:37.281 --> 43:40.117
This was no badass.
Anti-Crime would've done fine.

43:40.618 --> 43:42.369
I mean, if I would've had a chance
to think about it,

43:42.536 --> 43:43.662
it would've been all right.

43:44.371 --> 43:45.956
Don't you think that's a little strange?

43:46.624 --> 43:48.792
You needing time to prepare
for my assignments?

43:53.797 --> 43:56.091
I'm flesh and blood, Diane.

43:59.345 --> 44:02.264
- Bad things can happen.
- I know they can.

44:05.601 --> 44:07.936
Somebody comes home one night,
and they say, "I'm sick."

44:08.687 --> 44:10.564
Out of nowhere, she's sick,

44:11.649 --> 44:13.025
and she's never gonna get better.

44:17.780 --> 44:20.574
I can't walk on eggs
because your wife got sick.

44:26.205 --> 44:28.457
But I'm not... I'm not gonna
be taking any stupid chances.

44:29.833 --> 44:32.419
Because I've got such
a strong feeling for you, I...

44:36.256 --> 44:37.925
I hope we'll have a long time together.

44:43.764 --> 44:45.057
Let's take the night off.

44:48.352 --> 44:49.395
Okay.

44:55.442 --> 44:58.278
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yeah.
