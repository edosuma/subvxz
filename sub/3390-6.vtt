WEBVTT

00:52.500 --> 00:55.566
San Baek assigns Hyun-jun
a solo mission to assassinate

00:55.633 --> 00:58.166
President Seong-cheol Yun of the Supreme
People's Assembly Presidium.

00:58.866 --> 01:02.400
Hyun-jun succeeds in assassination
despite a risk of failure,

01:02.466 --> 01:04.433
but gets injured seriously in action.

01:05.800 --> 01:10.066
His best friend Sa-woo chases after him
under San Baek's order.

01:11.600 --> 01:13.700
Chul-young and Sun-hwa
from the North Korean Supreme Guard

01:13.966 --> 01:16.700
trail Hyun-jun and close in on him.

01:18.766 --> 01:22.433
Hyun-jun determines to avenge himself
on San Baek, who betrayed him.

01:23.166 --> 01:24.666
While he's on the run with Seung-hee,

01:25.033 --> 01:28.266
they come across Chul-young and Sun-hwa,
who were chasing after him.

01:29.300 --> 01:33.966
Hyun-jun, witnesses the car explode
with Seung-hee in it

01:34.233 --> 01:35.466
and he is left with a huge shock.

01:43.700 --> 01:45.633
EPISODE 6

02:49.500 --> 02:50.566
Hyun-jun.

02:52.466 --> 02:53.466
Sa-woo.

05:22.333 --> 05:24.566
SIX MONTHS LATER

05:42.733 --> 05:43.566
You.

05:43.633 --> 05:44.733
Why are you dressed like that?

05:46.000 --> 05:46.933
I'm a bit depressed.

05:47.500 --> 05:48.366
What?

05:51.533 --> 05:52.433
What a...

05:52.500 --> 05:53.333
Let her be.

05:53.566 --> 05:54.433
I can't, sir.

05:54.866 --> 05:56.066
The discipline here has been...

05:56.833 --> 05:58.200
My kids are no different.

05:58.966 --> 06:00.600
Nagging won't change anything.

06:01.300 --> 06:04.466
It's better to just embrace the changes.

06:09.133 --> 06:10.866
When private factories manufacture
gun barrels,

06:11.500 --> 06:13.200
they use a vise to fix the barrels

06:13.266 --> 06:14.566
and a cutting tool

06:14.633 --> 06:16.066
to carve striation.

06:16.133 --> 06:17.566
It leaves unique traces on the barrels.

06:18.400 --> 06:20.233
It's like fingerprints.

06:21.400 --> 06:24.333
This is AKS-74U from Incheon.

06:25.300 --> 06:29.166
And this is GSH-18 from Busan.

06:30.300 --> 06:33.066
The ones we found are exquisite,
but they were privately manufactured.

06:34.833 --> 06:36.133
It seems like a large amount of this

06:36.200 --> 06:37.533
will be smuggled into Korea soon.

06:37.600 --> 06:38.466
Did you look into this?

06:38.533 --> 06:39.433
Yes, sir.

06:40.433 --> 06:42.966
With the main variables as
possible entry date and shipping location,

06:43.066 --> 06:44.466
I narrowed the ships down.

06:45.266 --> 06:46.200
Why are there so many?

06:46.966 --> 06:47.866
Are they really filtered?

06:48.433 --> 06:50.400
How can we search them all
in such a short time?

06:51.466 --> 06:53.166
Kapula Sea  that's scheduled to arrive soon

06:53.533 --> 06:56.000
contains diplomatic pouches
to be delivered to the Russian Embassy.

06:56.566 --> 06:57.833
It might lead to diplomatic issues.

06:59.266 --> 07:00.233
Do you have any good idea?

07:02.700 --> 07:04.533
I wish Hyun-jun were here.

07:04.600 --> 07:06.433
Then, we can use his hunch--

07:07.633 --> 07:08.466
What?

07:16.533 --> 07:17.400
I told you

07:18.866 --> 07:20.633
to forget everything about him in the NSS.

07:25.033 --> 07:26.100
Don't mention his name again.

07:26.666 --> 07:27.566
Yes, sir.

08:05.033 --> 08:06.000
I've taken care

08:06.866 --> 08:08.066
of everything you'd ordered.

08:09.066 --> 08:09.966
Those who're eliminated

08:11.033 --> 08:13.000
will be listed as missing.

08:14.033 --> 08:14.866
I can see

08:15.733 --> 08:19.033
that you got used to working with me now.

08:20.433 --> 08:23.700
A man who lets his conscience or sense
of responsibility weaken his ambition

08:24.733 --> 08:26.666
can never achieve anything.

08:28.633 --> 08:29.533
Considering this,

08:30.633 --> 08:32.033
I made the right decision

08:32.799 --> 08:33.799
to choose you.

08:36.733 --> 08:37.666
Don't you think so?

09:52.900 --> 09:53.900
Back off.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.200
I don't give a shit. Get lost!

11:01.966 --> 11:04.733
The Office of the Inter-Korean Dialogue
just reported

11:05.000 --> 11:07.166
that the disconnected communications line
has been restored.

11:08.300 --> 11:09.600
It's very likely

11:09.966 --> 11:11.700
that the halted working-level talks
on economy

11:12.266 --> 11:13.933
will be resumed in the near future.

11:14.566 --> 11:15.500
It's good news.

11:16.100 --> 11:17.466
We can breathe easy now.

11:18.300 --> 11:20.133
Are there any other variables
to worry about, then?

11:20.600 --> 11:22.433
Those who claimed

11:22.633 --> 11:24.133
that it's the South who assassinated

11:24.200 --> 11:26.233
President Yun withdrew such allegation.

11:27.366 --> 11:30.333
It seems like their internal conflict
has been settled.

11:31.400 --> 11:32.300
I believe

11:32.366 --> 11:33.933
that there's no need to worry anymore.

11:34.400 --> 11:37.100
Tensions between the South
and the North almost brought about a war.

11:37.166 --> 11:39.066
But as it shows signs of improvement,

11:39.366 --> 11:40.466
it's a huge relief.

11:41.100 --> 11:42.833
Thank you for your hard work.

11:44.200 --> 11:46.066
Please call
for a National Security Council meeting.

11:46.733 --> 11:47.600
Yes, sir.

11:49.400 --> 11:52.400
How is it? The gardeners here are
very skillful, aren't they?

11:54.300 --> 11:58.200
They know exactly which branches
they should cut

11:58.900 --> 12:00.966
to get desired shapes.

12:05.633 --> 12:07.166
If it was neither the South nor the North,

12:09.066 --> 12:11.266
who would be responsible
for President Yun's assassination?

12:13.066 --> 12:13.966
It is

12:14.066 --> 12:15.466
difficult for me to assume.

12:16.566 --> 12:18.000
Seung-ryong Hong and Seong-cheol Yun

12:19.466 --> 12:22.300
both played a pivotal role
in the North's nuclear program.

12:23.700 --> 12:24.800
Their death reminds me

12:26.066 --> 12:29.433
of what happened in the South
when we were developing nuclear weapons.

12:30.300 --> 12:32.866
The scientists and officials
who participated in the nuclear program

12:33.466 --> 12:35.033
died mysteriously.

12:37.200 --> 12:40.533
I have a suspicion that there is
an extremely powerful gardener

12:41.800 --> 12:43.166
we do not know.

12:48.933 --> 12:49.933
How is Seung-hee doing?

12:52.166 --> 12:53.600
She severed contact with everyone

12:54.300 --> 12:55.300
and shut herself up.

12:55.366 --> 12:56.666
I think she finds it hard

12:56.733 --> 12:58.133
to come to terms with Hyun-jun's death.

13:00.300 --> 13:03.666
I used to have a cat a long ago.

13:06.033 --> 13:07.433
One day, she came back home

13:08.400 --> 13:10.300
severely wounded,

13:12.100 --> 13:14.400
and hid herself in the corner
of the dark basement.

13:16.600 --> 13:18.200
When I tried to take her

13:19.500 --> 13:22.100
out of the basement to treat her wound,

13:22.166 --> 13:23.233
she scratched me.

13:25.100 --> 13:26.066
Her serious wound

13:26.766 --> 13:28.533
made her hard to trust even her owner.

13:30.633 --> 13:32.133
I'm sure the way Seung-hee feels now

13:33.200 --> 13:35.366
is the same as the cat
who couldn't trust anyone.

13:38.100 --> 13:39.466
Time will cure her.

13:42.700 --> 13:43.800
What if her wound

13:45.133 --> 13:46.666
worsens?

13:50.566 --> 13:51.933
She's not that weak.

13:52.866 --> 13:53.933
Don't worry.

14:22.766 --> 14:23.733
Both Sa-woo

14:26.766 --> 14:27.766
and you'll be in danger.

14:28.633 --> 14:29.600
I can't do that.

14:31.733 --> 14:33.333
I can't leave you here like this.

14:33.400 --> 14:34.366
Seung-hee.

14:35.100 --> 14:36.366
If you die, I'll die with you.

14:38.666 --> 14:40.366
I can't leave by myself.

15:00.266 --> 15:01.166
Yes.

15:02.166 --> 15:03.033
I sent you the file.

15:04.133 --> 15:05.833
It contains records of hospitals
in Budapest,

15:06.933 --> 15:08.700
but there's nobody who seems
to be Hyun-jun.

15:09.800 --> 15:11.933
I've gone through everything
I've gathered,

15:12.500 --> 15:15.066
but the chance of his survival
is almost zero.

15:30.100 --> 15:32.200
Why don't you give up here?

15:35.033 --> 15:35.900
Seung-hee.

15:37.366 --> 15:38.266
Are you listening to me?

15:38.333 --> 15:39.366
Yes.

15:41.966 --> 15:44.566
Thank you for helping me.
I'll hang up, then.

15:44.733 --> 15:46.900
Right, I sent you one more file.

15:47.566 --> 15:49.666
It's a photo I got
from the Hungarian intelligence agency.

15:50.333 --> 15:52.800
It has two North Korean agents
who investigated President Yun's case.

15:53.866 --> 15:55.566
They both work for the Supreme Guard.

16:11.433 --> 16:12.766
REVOLUTIONARY SPIRIT OF BAEKDU

16:13.833 --> 16:15.800
HAIL DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF KOREA

17:25.466 --> 17:26.433
Will you meet with her?

17:28.700 --> 17:29.700
No.

18:07.966 --> 18:10.933
He's up. He's awake!

18:11.566 --> 18:13.900
He's awake! He's awake!

19:00.533 --> 19:01.633
The life sometimes

19:02.566 --> 19:03.533
is really harsh.

19:05.200 --> 19:08.000
It's not your fault that Seong-cheol died.

19:10.133 --> 19:11.866
Still, we absolutely need a scapegoat.

19:13.466 --> 19:14.666
Why are you so quiet?

19:16.200 --> 19:18.633
If someone should be held accountable
for failing the guard,

19:19.166 --> 19:20.433
it should be me.

19:22.633 --> 19:23.866
Stop bullshitting and take a seat.

19:29.766 --> 19:30.633
Nobody can bug

19:31.933 --> 19:34.133
this room.

19:34.966 --> 19:37.733
Any of tapping devices from the U.S.
and Japan,

19:38.500 --> 19:41.133
and even the surveillance of the Republic
cannot access this room.

19:42.166 --> 19:45.100
That means nobody knows what we say
and whom we backbite in this room,

19:47.566 --> 19:49.200
except you and me.

19:52.366 --> 19:54.033
Although it might be a blemish
on your career,

19:55.466 --> 19:57.833
Seong-cheol Yun's death isn't
necessarily bad for me.

20:06.200 --> 20:07.600
It's because the initiative he had

20:07.666 --> 20:10.333
in the nuclear program has fallen
into my hands.

20:13.433 --> 20:15.700
I'm sure you're well aware
of the importance of nuclear weapon

20:15.766 --> 20:16.766
to our Republic.

20:18.466 --> 20:20.066
It's the Republic's

20:20.700 --> 20:23.666
frantic last-ditch effort
against the world.

20:26.500 --> 20:27.466
I am planning

20:28.300 --> 20:31.133
to make the most
of the initiative in my hands.

20:32.100 --> 20:34.133
If it's to recover the people's pride

20:34.200 --> 20:36.166
which has been crushed and bruised,

20:36.233 --> 20:37.300
I don't care where it is.

20:38.366 --> 20:40.300
I'm firmly determined
to aim the nuclear missile.

20:43.566 --> 20:46.333
Both individuals and states sometimes
have to make a decision and leave it

20:47.833 --> 20:50.066
to chance when the future
seems to be unpredictable.

20:51.066 --> 20:52.366
I believe

20:52.433 --> 20:55.300
you agree with me.

20:56.533 --> 20:58.866
So I'm planning to reinstate you
who has lost everything

21:01.866 --> 21:03.866
due to Seong-cheol Yun's death.

21:05.433 --> 21:06.666
What's my job?

21:09.666 --> 21:10.833
There's no need to be in a rush.

21:11.766 --> 21:12.866
Let's take time

21:13.266 --> 21:14.300
and figure it out.

21:20.666 --> 21:21.800
I have a favor to ask you.

21:23.233 --> 21:24.133
Go ahead.

21:25.266 --> 21:26.600
If there's a way

21:27.666 --> 21:28.966
to save Agent Sun-hwa Kim--

21:29.033 --> 21:30.333
If I put her out of prison

21:30.400 --> 21:32.233
when I already saved you,

21:33.666 --> 21:34.933
wouldn't it be too suspicious?

21:36.600 --> 21:37.733
I'll think about it.

22:32.533 --> 22:34.333
I heard that you recovered
your consciousness.

22:35.200 --> 22:36.366
That's a relief.

22:37.566 --> 22:39.000
It means

22:39.700 --> 22:41.200
we still have a chance.

22:42.300 --> 22:43.133
Who are you?

22:44.366 --> 22:45.833
I'm the one who saved your life.

22:47.966 --> 22:49.400
Can you understand

22:49.800 --> 22:50.800
the situation you're in now?

22:53.733 --> 22:56.700
Former President Roosevelt who resigned
once said this.

22:58.233 --> 23:00.866
"In politics, nothing happens by accident.

23:02.133 --> 23:03.533
If it happens,

23:04.200 --> 23:06.700
you can bet it was planned that way."

23:09.433 --> 23:13.566
You're not entangled in this plot
by accident.

23:14.566 --> 23:16.833
You're rather chosen

23:17.600 --> 23:19.466
by those
who will benefit from the incident.

23:20.633 --> 23:21.800
Does it mean

23:22.700 --> 23:23.833
you know who they are?

23:25.233 --> 23:26.866
I know that the one who dragged you
in this

23:26.966 --> 23:28.500
and gave you the latest order

23:30.233 --> 23:32.200
isn't working independently.

23:35.066 --> 23:38.800
This conspiracy has begun much earlier
than you think,

23:39.800 --> 23:41.666
and it will continue.

23:45.866 --> 23:46.966
Who are you?

23:47.366 --> 23:48.600
Until I contact you again,

23:49.600 --> 23:51.633
please focus on recovering your health.

23:53.400 --> 23:55.733
There's something you should do
in due time.

24:24.166 --> 24:25.066
Seung-hee,

24:26.100 --> 24:26.966
let's have dinner first.

24:27.566 --> 24:28.800
Okay, let me finish this.

24:30.966 --> 24:31.866
Gosh.

24:32.666 --> 24:34.833
Now you've become an expert.

24:37.733 --> 24:39.266
How long are you going to stay here?

24:41.333 --> 24:43.166
For me, it's good if you stay here.

24:45.100 --> 24:47.666
But don't you have to go back
to where you're supposed to be?

24:49.200 --> 24:50.466
This is where I'm supposed to be.

24:51.933 --> 24:53.566
Stop such nonsense.

24:54.200 --> 24:56.366
There are places that need
your talents and capabilities.

24:57.033 --> 24:58.800
You can't just live here digging holes.

24:59.800 --> 25:00.933
You can stay here

25:01.733 --> 25:03.466
only until you pull yourself together.

25:04.566 --> 25:05.633
When your pain disappears

25:06.033 --> 25:07.133
and you get over the past,

25:08.133 --> 25:09.566
you must leave here.

25:10.500 --> 25:11.366
Understood?

25:12.700 --> 25:14.466
Make it quick and come inside.
Let's have dinner.

25:15.433 --> 25:16.333
Hurry.

25:17.033 --> 25:17.933
Okay.

25:35.733 --> 25:36.733
Do you enjoy working here?

25:38.066 --> 25:38.966
Yes.

25:39.766 --> 25:41.066
I think it suits me well.

25:41.866 --> 25:42.966
Did you say it suits you?

25:45.500 --> 25:47.333
So the best profiler in Korea found

25:47.933 --> 25:49.433
a new talent in gardening.

25:50.400 --> 25:51.400
It's pretty funny.

25:54.200 --> 25:55.800
Things are hectic in the office
these days.

25:56.700 --> 25:58.666
A military working-level talks will be--

25:58.733 --> 25:59.600
Sa-woo.

26:02.366 --> 26:03.366
That no longer has

26:04.700 --> 26:06.233
anything to do with me.

26:07.400 --> 26:08.600
I'm not interested in it,

26:10.100 --> 26:11.300
and it's not fascinating anymore.

26:23.633 --> 26:24.533
What are these flowers?

26:25.366 --> 26:26.433
They're irises.

26:27.700 --> 26:29.133
In Korean, it's  butkot .

26:30.066 --> 26:30.933
It's pretty.

26:31.366 --> 26:32.600
In Greek mythology,

26:33.500 --> 26:35.666
the river that flows in front of hell
is Iris.

26:37.900 --> 26:38.800
For me,

26:40.366 --> 26:42.200
it's not a pretty flower,
but a sad flower.

26:45.266 --> 26:46.966
Hyun-jun liked irises a lot.

27:20.966 --> 27:22.200
I'm sorry. You'd do the same...

27:23.666 --> 27:24.766
Don't move and just wait here.

27:26.766 --> 27:27.900
You have

27:28.066 --> 27:29.300
a solo mission.

27:31.466 --> 27:33.033
You'll be able to play a critical role

27:34.033 --> 27:36.400
in reunifying the Korean Peninsula
if you succeed in your mission.

27:43.566 --> 27:47.133
You're not entangled in this plot
by accident.

27:49.166 --> 27:51.333
You're rather chosen

27:52.233 --> 27:54.033
by those
who will benefit from the incident.

27:58.766 --> 28:00.366
I know that the one who dragged you
in this

28:00.466 --> 28:02.133
and gave you the latest order

28:02.866 --> 28:04.800
isn't working independently.

28:05.966 --> 28:09.700
This conspiracy has begun much earlier
than you think,

28:10.966 --> 28:12.733
and it will continue.

29:00.833 --> 29:06.900
GUARD BUREAU ONE

29:08.400 --> 29:09.233
Come in.

29:16.000 --> 29:17.200
This is sent from Budapest.

29:56.200 --> 29:58.100
This was taken when he crossed the border.

29:59.566 --> 30:01.000
It's the last chance for you to survive.

30:02.866 --> 30:03.833
He's in Japan now.

30:06.300 --> 30:07.133
Go get him.

34:29.400 --> 34:30.266
Don't push yourself.

34:38.866 --> 34:40.666
If I wanted to,
I would've killed you earlier.

35:20.233 --> 35:22.133
If you don't want to die,
you'd better drink this.

36:08.233 --> 36:09.100
Stop chasing after me.

36:09.966 --> 36:11.133
There's no more mercy next time.

36:41.700 --> 36:42.966
Hello.

36:44.766 --> 36:45.733
Hey.

36:48.266 --> 36:49.733
Please get up.

37:00.400 --> 37:01.533
It's you mister!

37:03.966 --> 37:05.200
Hey!

37:06.366 --> 37:08.466
Mister! What happened to you?

37:08.566 --> 37:11.966
What happened to you? Mister! Wake up!

37:12.366 --> 37:14.000
Mister! Mister!

38:50.800 --> 38:52.333
From Budapest to Akita...

38:52.400 --> 38:54.200
It must've been a long journey.

38:57.566 --> 38:59.066
Who is it?

39:02.866 --> 39:05.066
Hachioji intersection, 09120249#

39:28.033 --> 39:29.433
It was hard to find you.

39:31.400 --> 39:32.333
You haven't forgotten

39:33.333 --> 39:34.333
my voice, have you?

39:36.633 --> 39:37.766
Why did you have to find me?

39:39.366 --> 39:40.533
As I said in Hungary,

39:41.133 --> 39:43.500
we have something to do together.

39:43.566 --> 39:44.633
I'm not interested.

39:45.400 --> 39:47.200
So you chose revenge, then?

39:49.000 --> 39:51.866
There's a saying that a journey of revenge
requires you to dig two graves.

39:53.466 --> 39:54.666
One is for your enemy,

39:55.700 --> 39:57.366
and the other one is for yourself.

39:58.600 --> 39:59.833
Don't look for me anymore.

40:00.533 --> 40:01.400
I'll hang up.

40:01.466 --> 40:02.533
Let me ask you one last time.

40:03.533 --> 40:05.566
Will you really not join me?

40:23.833 --> 40:24.900
Hey!

40:25.366 --> 40:26.566
Where have you been?

40:28.233 --> 40:29.533
I've been waiting for you.

40:29.600 --> 40:30.433
Let's go home.

40:32.500 --> 40:34.366
Let's go, are you okay?

41:01.166 --> 41:02.066
Come out.

41:07.166 --> 41:08.066
Is it you again?

41:11.333 --> 41:12.500
You'll really lose your life.

41:12.566 --> 41:13.566
Shut up.

41:14.533 --> 41:15.600
Do you think

41:15.700 --> 41:17.266
I'd be grateful because you saved me once?

41:18.566 --> 41:19.500
You got me wrong.

41:22.133 --> 41:22.966
Don't move.

41:30.666 --> 41:31.566
I told you.

41:31.633 --> 41:32.600
There's no mercy anymore.

42:54.100 --> 42:55.066
Kill me.

42:59.633 --> 43:00.633
Just kill me.

43:09.033 --> 43:10.533
Why are you doing this to me?

43:13.766 --> 43:15.000
I tried to kill you.

43:16.566 --> 43:17.533
Why do you

43:18.866 --> 43:19.766
keep me alive?

43:20.400 --> 43:21.266
What about you?

43:23.233 --> 43:24.300
What are you doing this for?

43:55.966 --> 43:56.866
Go back.

43:59.266 --> 44:00.400
I've got nowhere to go back.

44:05.333 --> 44:06.500
If I fail to kill you,

44:11.933 --> 44:13.066
I have no place to go.

44:17.166 --> 44:18.066
Kill me, then.

44:21.400 --> 44:22.366
But not now.

44:22.433 --> 44:23.866
There's something I must do.

44:27.633 --> 44:28.600
When it's done,

44:29.066 --> 44:30.633
do whatever you want.

45:09.466 --> 45:11.266
If you don't want to die,
you'd better drink this.

45:17.800 --> 45:19.000
Why are you doing this to me?

45:21.800 --> 45:22.800
I tried to kill you.

45:24.400 --> 45:25.300
Why do you

45:26.733 --> 45:27.633
keep me alive?

45:28.400 --> 45:29.333
What about you?

45:30.466 --> 45:31.500
What are you doing this for?

46:46.466 --> 46:47.533
Excuse me.

46:49.433 --> 46:52.566
Is there anything

46:54.800 --> 46:56.466
I can help you with?

47:10.433 --> 47:13.400
Thanks, Yuki. You can leave it there.

47:28.633 --> 47:30.300
I have no idea what to choose.

47:34.533 --> 47:35.800
No, not this one.

47:37.466 --> 47:39.600
Let's buy this one. Looks delicious.

47:39.666 --> 47:43.066
-Excuse me, we want this one.
-Okay, a moment please.

47:43.433 --> 47:44.966
No, no.

47:45.600 --> 47:46.433
Put it down.

47:47.300 --> 47:49.100
I'm sorry.

47:49.733 --> 47:50.566
Hold it like this.

48:56.566 --> 48:58.200
There's a sad myth about this statue.

49:00.933 --> 49:02.366
What is it?

49:07.266 --> 49:08.266
You just said

49:09.800 --> 49:11.833
that there's a sad myth about this statue.

49:15.700 --> 49:16.733
I don't believe myths.

49:55.766 --> 49:58.100
The North's Attempt to Bring
Regime Change by Assassinating Yun

50:49.933 --> 50:50.866
But not now.

50:51.333 --> 50:52.566
There's something I must do.

50:53.800 --> 50:54.766
When it's done,

50:55.266 --> 50:56.566
do whatever you want.

51:16.766 --> 51:18.333
I'm going to be away for a while.

51:21.066 --> 51:28.066
I'm going to be away for a while Sun-hwa

51:38.233 --> 51:39.100
Seung-hee.

51:42.500 --> 51:43.400
Hey, come in.

51:44.233 --> 51:45.266
I got something to tell you.

51:45.866 --> 51:48.100
Do you remember Sun-hwa Kim?

51:49.433 --> 51:50.433
She's arrested.

51:52.466 --> 51:53.966
There was an armed runaway soldier

51:54.066 --> 51:55.666
from legion 360 in Sokcho, Gangwon,

51:56.533 --> 51:58.166
and the military police happened
to catch her

51:58.233 --> 51:59.533
when they were tracking the soldier.

52:00.200 --> 52:02.166
She's being transferred to the NSS now.

52:03.266 --> 52:04.600
According to the police report,

52:04.666 --> 52:06.766
she possessed two Russian Makarov pistols

52:06.833 --> 52:08.300
when she was captured.

52:09.533 --> 52:10.700
And what's weird is

52:11.366 --> 52:12.633
that there were documents

52:12.700 --> 52:14.900
about Director Baek in her possessions.

52:15.966 --> 52:17.633
Even if she's a special agent,

52:18.166 --> 52:19.566
Having information about the NSS...

52:19.633 --> 52:22.666
especially the detailed one
about the Deputy Director is strange.

52:23.200 --> 52:24.266
Don't you think?

52:51.500 --> 52:52.366
Ma'am!

52:54.733 --> 52:55.633
Have you been doing well?

52:56.333 --> 52:57.966
We haven't been doing well without you.

52:58.966 --> 53:00.066
So you came back to the NSS?

53:00.700 --> 53:02.300
No. I came to visit Director Baek.

53:03.500 --> 53:04.366
See you later.

53:08.300 --> 53:09.233
She looks even better.

53:10.533 --> 53:11.433
What?

53:15.566 --> 53:17.066
Why don't you come back to work now?

53:20.100 --> 53:20.966
Seung-hee.

53:22.500 --> 53:24.266
I came here to ask a favor to Director.

53:27.133 --> 53:28.033
What is it?

53:30.533 --> 53:31.766
Allow me to meet with Sun-hwa Kim.

53:32.433 --> 53:33.333
Where did you

53:34.966 --> 53:36.066
get that information from?

53:36.966 --> 53:38.466
You're not an agent now.

53:38.533 --> 53:40.433
We can't let you interrogate
such important suspect.

53:40.933 --> 53:41.866
Sir.

53:41.933 --> 53:44.633
There are rules and procedures
that must be abided by.

53:45.500 --> 53:46.533
If you really want to do it,

53:47.033 --> 53:48.333
return to duty officially.

53:50.666 --> 53:52.133
Others can do this job besides you.

53:52.200 --> 53:53.433
So did you find out anything?

53:56.533 --> 53:57.533
Please give me a chance.

53:57.600 --> 53:58.733
Stop being irrational.

53:59.100 --> 54:01.133
You know better that you can't.

54:01.200 --> 54:02.200
Sir.

54:04.033 --> 54:04.966
Go meet her.

54:07.000 --> 54:08.366
Give her what she needs.

55:01.300 --> 55:02.266
Sun-hwa Kim.

55:14.066 --> 55:15.033
You had...

55:16.066 --> 55:17.600
this photo with you, right?

55:22.200 --> 55:23.133
Why?

55:26.233 --> 55:27.233
Where did you...

55:28.500 --> 55:29.766
get this photo from?

55:44.833 --> 55:45.933
What I want to know

55:47.433 --> 55:49.000
is not why you came here.

55:51.700 --> 55:53.566
The guy in Budapest...

55:55.866 --> 55:57.833
I want to know if he's alive or not.

56:03.600 --> 56:04.500
Is he alive?

56:23.400 --> 56:24.366
I don't know.

56:24.833 --> 56:26.333
I'm not interrogating you now,

56:26.400 --> 56:27.666
but begging you.

56:30.500 --> 56:31.433
Please tell me.

56:39.500 --> 56:40.733
Seung-hee!

56:41.033 --> 56:41.966
Open the door!

56:43.866 --> 56:44.766
Seung-hee Choi!

56:46.100 --> 56:47.033
Open the door now!

56:49.733 --> 56:50.666
Seung-hee!

56:51.800 --> 56:52.700
Open the door right now!

56:52.766 --> 56:53.833
I guess I have to stop here.

56:54.800 --> 56:55.766
Seung-hee Choi!

57:00.333 --> 57:01.366
They will come in

57:02.000 --> 57:03.300
and interrogate you now.

57:04.000 --> 57:04.933
Seung-hee!

57:05.366 --> 57:07.300
Even if you've received special trainings,

57:08.400 --> 57:10.000
you know that you won't be able
to stand it.

57:10.700 --> 57:11.966
Seung-hee, open the door now!

57:13.033 --> 57:15.100
-Seung-hee!
-I'm sure we'll meet again.

57:15.166 --> 57:16.266
Open the door right now!

57:23.600 --> 57:24.700
Seung-hee!

57:24.766 --> 57:25.766
Open the door!

57:27.466 --> 57:28.466
Seung-hee!

57:29.866 --> 57:30.766
Open it right now!

57:33.400 --> 57:34.366
Seung-hee!

57:35.600 --> 57:36.500
I said open the door!

57:45.900 --> 57:47.366
What the hell do you think you're doing?

57:47.733 --> 57:48.666
I'm sorry.

58:03.733 --> 58:04.933
Take charge of the interrogation.

58:22.700 --> 58:23.566
Ma'am.

58:26.033 --> 58:26.933
Can you spare a moment?

58:37.233 --> 58:38.200
You meet Seung-hee

58:39.600 --> 58:40.566
from time to time, right?

58:42.033 --> 58:42.866
Yes.

58:42.933 --> 58:44.100
She's my friend.

58:48.000 --> 58:54.466
I know that... you're leaking information
from the NSS.

58:56.933 --> 59:00.366
I guess you didn't take it seriously
because it was Seung-hee.

59:02.733 --> 59:04.066
But that's why it's more problematic.

59:05.333 --> 59:07.600
-What do you mean?
-Because of the information you leaked,

59:09.766 --> 59:11.800
Seung-hee can be in danger.

59:16.066 --> 59:17.033
I'm warning you.

59:18.533 --> 59:19.766
Don't ever do that again.

1:00:03.566 --> 1:00:06.066
It's paroxysmal ventricular fibrillation
caused by toxic substance.

1:00:06.400 --> 1:00:07.600
Call an ambulance now.

1:00:07.666 --> 1:00:09.866
We need permission
because she's an important suspect.

1:00:10.466 --> 1:00:11.400
Can't you just do it here?

1:00:11.466 --> 1:00:12.733
I can't. Get permission right now!

1:00:21.033 --> 1:00:22.400
Her heartbeat started slowing down.

1:00:22.900 --> 1:00:25.300
-Vasopressin, two milliliters.
-Got it. Injecting two milliliters.

1:02:29.933 --> 1:02:32.266
Shall we resume, then?

1:03:28.466 --> 1:03:29.500
Where is Hyun-jun?

1:03:34.500 --> 1:03:35.433
Hyun-jun is dead!

1:03:36.300 --> 1:03:37.433
