WEBVTT

00:09.440 --> 00:11.396
- Sloan, I'm coming right down!

00:11.440 --> 00:13.567
- This is a stakeout,
not a sleepover.

00:13.620 --> 00:15.485
- Ugh. I wasn't sleeping.

00:15.530 --> 00:17.395
- You were snoring!

00:17.450 --> 00:20.829
Late night with Mel?
- Not in the Biblical sense.

00:20.890 --> 00:23.279
Ahh... she's winding down
a big trial.

00:23.320 --> 00:25.538
I was helping her with
her closing arguments all night.

00:25.590 --> 00:27.626
- Look at you.

00:27.670 --> 00:29.547
Look at you!

00:29.590 --> 00:32.195
You and Dr. Ken seem
joined at the lip these days.

00:32.240 --> 00:35.721
The doctor
has a lovely bedside manner.

00:40.380 --> 00:43.850
- Oh.

00:43.910 --> 00:47.641
It's mom.
- Well, tell Nora I said hi.

00:47.690 --> 00:49.954
Did you just press ignore
on your mother?

00:50.000 --> 00:51.956
- Yeah!
- I thought you guys

00:52.000 --> 00:54.468
had patched things up.
- We did... mostly.

00:54.530 --> 00:56.782
It's just when things
are going great in my life,

00:56.830 --> 00:59.003
she gets all... girlfriend-y.

00:59.050 --> 01:00.961
- Maybe she just misses you.

01:01.010 --> 01:03.570
- I know. I'll call her back.

01:03.620 --> 01:07.408
."Soon!

01:13.460 --> 01:16.509
- Incoming.

01:24.340 --> 01:26.649
- Not so fast. I got here first.
- Oh, the hell you did!

01:26.690 --> 01:29.124
Forget you ever saw this idiot.

01:29.170 --> 01:31.081
- I'm an interested buyer
looking to acquire

01:31.130 --> 01:33.121
some quality,
imported electronics

01:33.180 --> 01:35.250
for a reasonable price.

01:35.310 --> 01:38.086
I'll give you $5 000
for the whole truck.

01:38.140 --> 01:40.870
- No, she's not. But I am.

01:40.920 --> 01:44.617
He told me to take care of you
boys. How does 10 grand sound?

01:47.060 --> 01:49.278
I just want
those laptops back there.

01:49.320 --> 01:51.106
You guys keep the rest
for yourselves.

01:53.330 --> 01:56.800
- Sorry sweetheart. Come on.

02:01.420 --> 02:05.686
HEY! HEY! HEY! COME ON!
- HEY! COME ON, MAN! LET US OUT!

02:05.730 --> 02:07.903
- I'll call Maz.
- Alright.

02:07.950 --> 02:10.942
- OPEN UP!
- HEY, VERY FUNNY MAN!

02:11.000 --> 02:13.685
HEY, OPEN UP!
- GET GOING!
- COME ON!

02:27.880 --> 02:30.701
- Hi.
- Hi! Uh...

02:30.750 --> 02:33.184
You forgot these in my car.

02:33.240 --> 02:35.276
There you go.
- Yeah, uh... thanks.

02:35.320 --> 02:38.062
- Yeah.

02:38.110 --> 02:40.886
Hey, so, uh...
- Oh, good morning!

02:40.940 --> 02:42.896
: Hey!
: You get my message?

02:42.940 --> 02:46.546
- Uh, yeah. Yeah, I had the
night shift send a unit over.

02:46.600 --> 02:48.727
So... they got your note.
- Just a couple of superheroes

02:48.770 --> 02:51.728
keeping the citizens
of Metropolis safe.

02:51.780 --> 02:53.554
- Great, except now, I can't
get the image of you wearing...

02:53.600 --> 02:55.329
red spandex out of my head.

02:55.390 --> 02:57.551
- Ugh. Thanks for that.
Are you here to see me?

02:57.610 --> 02:59.862
- No. Uh, yes. I, uh...

02:59.910 --> 03:02.253
I was here to see you.
Done that,

03:02.310 --> 03:05.655
so... that's it for this point
in time I'm gonna get...

03:05.700 --> 03:07.691
going 'cause I gotta...
I gotta mosey.

03:07.750 --> 03:12.221
I got a lot of other things
to do. I gotta go. Uh... yeah.

03:12.270 --> 03:14.704
- I don't know!

03:14.750 --> 03:17.571
Who cares?

03:17.630 --> 03:19.279
Aanay, new client.

03:19.320 --> 03:21.368
Beth Jacobs.

03:21.410 --> 03:23.549
Urgent. Go!

03:27.810 --> 03:30.984
- You're throwing muffins!
Come on!

03:31.030 --> 03:33.157
- I'm trying!
- Don't try! Just do it!

03:33.210 --> 03:35.166
Put that hip!

03:35.210 --> 03:37.383
- Looking good, Jacobs!
- Thanks, Hank.

03:37.430 --> 03:39.603
- Gotta keep your chin down
when you throw that, man.

03:39.650 --> 03:41.686
That's it!

03:41.740 --> 03:43.696
- Take it you two
aren't here to work out.

03:43.740 --> 03:45.435
- No. We're looking
for Beth Jacobs.

03:45.480 --> 03:47.607
Thanks.

03:47.660 --> 03:51.528
- Let me take 10.

03:53.660 --> 03:55.742
- Throw it like you mean it!
Let's go!

03:55.800 --> 03:57.483
: Hey, Beth Jacobs?

03:57.540 --> 03:59.792
- And you're Matt Shade.

03:59.840 --> 04:02.843
It's an honour. My dad
used to watch all your games.

04:02.890 --> 04:05.108
- Ouch.

04:05.150 --> 04:07.015
- I'm Angie Everett.
What can we do for you?

04:07.070 --> 04:09.152
- My manager said
you might be able to help me.

04:09.200 --> 04:11.668
I'm fighting the regional
championship on Friday.

04:11.720 --> 04:13.859
I win that, it's one more step
toward the nationals.

04:17.120 --> 04:19.293
- My qualifying match

04:19.340 --> 04:22.127
was against Denise Perez,
but the fight was rigged.

04:22.170 --> 04:25.344
- Look, Beth, nobody likes
to lose, but that doesn't
mean your fight was rigg--

04:25.390 --> 04:27.858
- No! Listen. I didn't lose
the fight against Denise. I won.

04:29.960 --> 04:32.303
- Integrity! That's her problem.

04:32.350 --> 04:35.353
Just my luck, managing
a fighter with a conscience.

04:35.400 --> 04:37.448
Hey buddy--

04:39.490 --> 04:42.573
- Angie, meet Murray Clavin,

04:42.630 --> 04:44.837
my former manager.

04:44.890 --> 04:46.494
The guy who stole all my money.

04:49.940 --> 04:53.546
- I see you and you see me

04:53.590 --> 04:57.720
Watch you blowin' the lines
when you're makin' a scene

04:57.770 --> 05:00.557
Oh boy, you've got to know

05:00.600 --> 05:03.296
What my head overlooks

05:03.340 --> 05:06.776
The senses will show
to my heart

05:06.820 --> 05:12.087
When it's watching for lies
'cause you can't escape my

05:12.130 --> 05:15.213
- Private Eyes
They're watching you

05:15.270 --> 05:18.398
Private Eyes

05:18.440 --> 05:20.704
They're watching you,
watching you, watching you

05:20.750 --> 05:22.479
Watching you

05:24.750 --> 05:27.366
- Alright, time! Time!

05:27.410 --> 05:31.016
- That's it, Jerry! That's it!
Keep going! Keep it up!

05:31.060 --> 05:33.016
- Sorry you had to see that.
- Hey, I would've done

05:33.070 --> 05:35.026
the same thing. He cheated you
out of millions.

05:35.070 --> 05:38.369
- I could never actually
prove anything.
- Oh, come on.

05:38.420 --> 05:40.149
He always claimed it wasn't his
fault, but all my investments

05:40.200 --> 05:42.077
went south.
- Yeah. With him.

05:42.120 --> 05:43.985
To the Caymans. Let's go.

05:44.030 --> 05:47.943
Shade, you're not
actually considering

05:47.990 --> 05:50.550
taking this case.
- No! Of course not.

05:50.610 --> 05:53.773
You know, we were together
for 20 years.

05:53.830 --> 05:55.513
He spotted me when I was a kid.

05:55.570 --> 05:57.731
Took me under his wing.

05:57.790 --> 06:00.133
We'd be on the road together
for weeks. He...

06:00.180 --> 06:02.000
kind of became
a second father to me.

06:02.050 --> 06:04.006
- Yeah. A father
who betrayed you.

06:04.050 --> 06:06.006
- Yeah. And it hurt, but...

06:06.060 --> 06:08.278
I've grown. Matured.

06:08.320 --> 06:10.572
- OK, whoa. Let's not
get carried away.

06:10.630 --> 06:12.359
What do you wanna do?
We can walk out of here

06:12.410 --> 06:14.719
right now.

06:14.760 --> 06:16.716
- Yeah, you're right.
Life's too short.

06:16.760 --> 06:19.718
I'm gonna tell him
we can't take the case.

06:19.770 --> 06:22.580
- Bet you been wanting
to do that for a while.

06:22.640 --> 06:25.370
- 10 years, 4 months, 23 days.
- Yeah, well...

06:25.420 --> 06:27.376
With friends like me,

06:27.430 --> 06:30.297
who needs enemies? Ha ha ha ha!

06:30.340 --> 06:33.810
- Oh, come on, Shadow! I used
to be able to crack you up.

06:33.870 --> 06:35.826
You remember
that time in Pittsburgh,

06:35.870 --> 06:37.906
bought you a strippergram
for your let birthday?

06:37.960 --> 06:40.212
Ha ha! Oh man,
were you surprised!

06:40.260 --> 06:42.876
- As I recall,
it was Sudbury, I was 17,

06:42.920 --> 06:45.002
the table dancer
had an Adam's apple, and yes,

06:45.050 --> 06:48.099
you could say I was surprised.
- Alright, look.

06:48.140 --> 06:51.223
The point is, we have history.

06:51.280 --> 06:54.226
You can't turn your back
on history, right?

06:54.280 --> 06:57.238
- I'm fine.

06:57.280 --> 07:00.192
It's just his way of saying
hello to an old friend.

07:00.240 --> 07:03.937
- Uh, Murray, listen.
- Uh oh.

07:03.980 --> 07:06.119
- We got a pretty heavy caseload
these days, so...

07:06.160 --> 07:08.333
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
I get it.

07:10.640 --> 07:13.768
- They're not
gonna take our case.

07:13.820 --> 07:16.380
Why not?
- We just don't

07:16.430 --> 07:20.161
have the time to fully invest
the resources of our agency--

07:20.220 --> 07:23.087
- No. You can't walk out on me.
If word gets out

07:23.130 --> 07:25.473
the fight was rigged, everyone's
gonna think I'm a dirty fighter.

07:25.530 --> 07:27.691
- I'm sorry, Beth.

07:27.750 --> 07:30.310
- Shadow, please. If I make it

07:30.360 --> 07:32.521
to the championship,
I want it to be on my terms

07:32.580 --> 07:34.798
because I earned it.

07:34.840 --> 07:36.751
I can't have this hanging over
my head the rest of my career.

07:39.500 --> 07:41.889
Kid's got an honest heart.

07:41.930 --> 07:43.488
Reminds me of someone
I used to know.

07:43.550 --> 07:46.189
- Murray...
- Alright, look. I know

07:46.240 --> 07:47.935
I messed up in the past,
but she shouldn't have to pay

07:47.980 --> 07:50.722
have to pay for my mistakes.

07:50.770 --> 07:52.590
You don't take this case,

07:52.640 --> 07:54.892
she may never fight again.

08:01.740 --> 08:03.776
: Fastest southpaw
in the Golden Horsehoe.

08:03.830 --> 08:06.048
: Until my shoulder
started to give way.

08:06.090 --> 08:08.308
: That's pretty
impressive, Hank.

08:08.350 --> 08:10.261
- Years later, I hung up the
boxing gloves and opened up

08:10.310 --> 08:12.358
this gym. Fighter
to businessman overnight.

08:12.400 --> 08:16.188
- You know it. Life goes on.

08:16.230 --> 08:19.279
- A couple of years.

08:19.320 --> 08:21.140
She's still green,
but she's got staying power.

08:21.190 --> 08:23.499
She don't back down for no one.

08:23.540 --> 08:25.531
- And her opponent, Denise
Perez, how would you rate her?

08:25.590 --> 08:27.717
- More experienced.

08:27.760 --> 08:30.547
- Would've thought so,

08:30.590 --> 08:33.241
'til that fight. Beth's
been training pretty hard.

08:33.290 --> 08:35.542
She's got a killer combination.
Looks like they're payin' off.

08:35.600 --> 08:37.898
- Is there any chance
the fight was fixed?

08:37.950 --> 08:40.032
- No way.

08:40.080 --> 08:42.867
I'm one of four gyms
in this city

08:42.910 --> 08:45.777
that's authorized
to hold qualifying bouts.

08:45.820 --> 08:48.084
I run a clean shop.
- So, you don't put any stock

08:48.130 --> 08:50.178
in Beth's suspicions?

08:50.220 --> 08:52.176
- Listen. That girl
would never tell you this,

08:52.220 --> 08:54.438
but she's been
through the ringer.

08:54.490 --> 08:56.526
Mother ran off early.

08:56.570 --> 08:58.572
First punch she ever threw
was at her father.

08:58.620 --> 09:01.532
Bottom line is,
that girl could use a break.

09:01.580 --> 09:04.014
She should just take the win
and be happy.

09:04.060 --> 09:06.847
- Would you mind
if we talk to the ref?

09:06.890 --> 09:09.108
- Be my guest.

09:09.150 --> 09:11.323
Megan calls them
as she sees them.

09:11.370 --> 09:13.281
Anything hinky went on
in that ring,

09:13.330 --> 09:15.286
she'd know about it.

09:15.330 --> 09:17.548
- Thanks.

09:17.600 --> 09:19.989
Filterless, huh?

09:20.030 --> 09:22.203
- I never used to smoke
or drInk,

09:22.250 --> 09:24.514
and would you believe it?
I was a vegan.

09:24.560 --> 09:27.427
- Wow. Now you seem to have
had a change of heart.

09:27.470 --> 09:30.291
- So, to answer
your next question:

09:30.350 --> 09:32.602
No. I can't be bought.

09:32.650 --> 09:35.653
- So in your mind, Beth's fight
was totally legit.

09:35.700 --> 09:38.260
- That's the way I called it,
didn't I?

09:38.310 --> 09:40.266
- Yeah, but back in my pro days,
refs would make calls

09:40.310 --> 09:43.746
all the time that were...
let's say... less than accurate.

09:43.800 --> 09:46.610
- I remember watching you play.

09:46.670 --> 09:48.535
You deserved every damn penalty

09:48.580 --> 09:50.798
they threw at you.
- Now hold on a second!

09:50.850 --> 09:53.193
- And I bet you got away
with a lot of crap, too.

09:53.240 --> 09:56.027
Stuff you pulled
when the refs head was turned.

09:56.070 --> 09:59.324
- Well...
- Exactly. I only got two eyes.

10:02.210 --> 10:04.155
But as far as I'm concerned,

10:04.210 --> 10:06.849
Beth Jacobs knocked her out,

10:06.910 --> 10:09.253
fair and square. Don't take
my word for it, though.

10:09.300 --> 10:11.518
Check out the video.

10:11.560 --> 10:14.085
- City Sport's Channel
shot the match.

10:14.130 --> 10:17.088
They'd have the tapes.

10:17.130 --> 10:19.086
- Thanks.

10:19.140 --> 10:22.268
- Mhm. No problem. Mmm!

10:25.710 --> 10:27.484
- OK. I'll see you in a bit.

10:27.530 --> 10:29.703
- Whoa.

10:29.750 --> 10:32.878
Check out this move.
That was seven kinds of awesome.

10:32.930 --> 10:35.751
- Huh. I didn't know
you were into boxing.

10:35.800 --> 10:39.236
- I wasn't, but it looks
like a good way to get out some
pent-up frustration. You know,

10:39.290 --> 10:41.235
all the anger and resentment
that festers in your gut until,

10:41.290 --> 10:43.929
one day, you think you're gonna
explode and just punch someone
right in the...

10:46.680 --> 10:49.296
Plus it's an elegant
and classic sport.

10:49.340 --> 10:51.376
- Hey. There. Knockout punch.
Rewind that.

10:56.300 --> 10:58.256
Did you see that?

10:58.300 --> 11:00.348
Beth's punch
barely connects with Denise.

11:00.390 --> 11:02.950
- Yeah. The glove
just grazed her cheek.

11:03.010 --> 11:04.693
- And the ref wouldn't be able
to see it from that angle.

11:04.750 --> 11:06.877
- So... the fight was rigged.

11:09.450 --> 11:12.920
- There's one person
who knows for sure.

11:12.970 --> 11:15.882
: Hey, Denise!
That's pretty impressive.

11:15.930 --> 11:19.104
Day after a knockout
and you're hard at it.

11:19.150 --> 11:21.277
- Angie Everett and Matt Shade.

11:21.330 --> 11:23.321
We're private investigators.

11:23.370 --> 11:26.112
- Happy for you.
- You know, back in my day,

11:26.160 --> 11:27.934
when I got cross-checked
into unconsciousness,

11:27.990 --> 11:30.208
the doctors would
make me want days

11:30.250 --> 11:32.593
before resuming training.
Of course, now, the protocols

11:32.640 --> 11:35.074
are even tougher.

11:35.120 --> 11:38.294
- Just... surprised that you're
back at it so quickly.

11:38.340 --> 11:40.865
- Yeah. The doc cleared me.
- That, or you took a dive.

11:40.910 --> 11:43.128
- We saw the footage

11:43.180 --> 11:46.172
from last night's fight.
- That was no knockout punch.
Beth barely touched you.

11:46.220 --> 11:48.176
- You don't even know me.
You come here,

11:48.220 --> 11:50.563
insult me to my face.
I don't need this.

11:50.620 --> 11:53.180
I got roadwork to do.

11:55.360 --> 11:57.316
- Looks like we struck a nerve.

11:59.370 --> 12:01.759
Let's dig into
little Miss Non-Congenialty.

12:01.800 --> 12:04.587
- Text from my Dad.
Says he wants to talk.

12:04.630 --> 12:06.586
- Sweet.
- No.

12:06.630 --> 12:09.417
That's suspicious.

12:11.900 --> 12:14.892
- Hey!

12:14.950 --> 12:17.942
How 'bout some lunch?
- It's four o'clock.

12:17.990 --> 12:20.993
- Dad, I'm working a case.

12:21.040 --> 12:23.383
- Yeah, I'm glad
you brought that up.

12:23.430 --> 12:25.864
I hear Murray Clavin's
back in town.

12:25.910 --> 12:28.083
- Ugh! Not this again.
- I don't trust that guy

12:28.130 --> 12:30.872
and neither should you.
- I don't!

12:30.920 --> 12:34.219
- It wasn't for Murray. It was
for this young fighter

12:34.270 --> 12:36.226
of his, Beth.
- Look...

12:36.270 --> 12:39.182
Murray thinks that
you're a soft touch.

12:39.230 --> 12:41.221
So what's his real angle?
- Ugh! Dad...

12:41.280 --> 12:43.976
I'm a full-grown adult.
I can look after myself.

12:44.020 --> 12:46.409
I got this. Trust me!

12:46.460 --> 12:50.328
- This is the last of Denise's
financial statements from Maz.

12:50.370 --> 12:53.248
- Wow. This girl

12:53.290 --> 12:57.374
is $8 000 in credit card debt.
Man, these minimum payments

12:57.420 --> 12:59.593
are killing her.
- No spike in her bank account.

12:59.640 --> 13:02.814
And as far as I can tell, she
hasn't bought a Tesla recently.

13:02.860 --> 13:04.816
- If Denise was bribed
into taking a fall, then where

13:04.870 --> 13:07.259
did the money go? You checked
her social presence, right?

13:07.300 --> 13:09.165
- Oh, my God. IfI see
one more duckface...

13:09.220 --> 13:11.438
- OK.

13:11.480 --> 13:14.916
- Wait. Wait, hold on. Isn't...

13:14.960 --> 13:17.303
that Denise?

13:17.360 --> 13:19.316
- An online boxing forum

13:19.360 --> 13:21.521
for underground fights.

13:21.580 --> 13:24.356
- Denise had a fight last week.
- An unsanctioned fight.

13:24.410 --> 13:26.366
That's it. That's all

13:26.410 --> 13:29.971
the leverage they needed.

13:30.020 --> 13:32.671
: If the commission
ever found out

13:32.720 --> 13:35.450
that Denise was in an illegal
fight, she'd be banned for life.

13:35.510 --> 13:37.455
- That's a dangerous secret
to keep. Do you think someone

13:37.510 --> 13:39.933
found out and blackmailed her
into taking a dive?

13:39.990 --> 13:43.289
- Missing the regional
championships is better
than never fighting again.

13:43.340 --> 13:47.208
Hey, Denise!

13:47.260 --> 13:50.218
- LOOK OUT!

13:52.910 --> 13:55.344
I'll call the police.

13:55.390 --> 13:58.268
- No!
- You know who
was driving that car.

13:58.310 --> 14:00.778
- Just back off!
- Look, we know about

14:00.840 --> 14:03.570
the underground fights.
If someone's threatening you,

14:03.620 --> 14:05.576
we can help.
You almost got me

14:05.620 --> 14:08.088
killed. Just stay away from me!

14:55.020 --> 14:57.750
Shade?

14:57.800 --> 15:00.678
- Ahh! Oh. Take it slow.

15:00.720 --> 15:03.632
Take it slow. _
How many fingers am I holding?

15:03.680 --> 15:06.069
- Thursday.
- OK, I'm calling the doctor.

15:06.120 --> 15:07.985
- I'm kidding!
I'm kidding. Three,

15:08.030 --> 15:10.942
and you need a manicure.

15:10.990 --> 15:13.379
- Ah, thanks.

15:15.690 --> 15:18.158
- It was just a six-foot blur
with a man-sized left hook.

15:18.220 --> 15:20.381
- OK. Well, give me the keys.

15:23.270 --> 15:25.044
- I'm not letting you drive.
You're still cross-eyed!

15:27.700 --> 15:29.656
- Fine.

15:29.710 --> 15:32.008
- Woo hoo!

15:34.060 --> 15:36.369
: So much
for being a superhero.

15:36.410 --> 15:39.015
- I'm fine, by the way.

15:39.060 --> 15:41.062
- You couldn't get anything
out of Denise?

15:41.110 --> 15:43.066
- Bupkus. She claimed
nothing happened.

15:43.110 --> 15:45.499
- That's crazy. We saw the car.
- Did it really look like

15:45.550 --> 15:47.506
the driver was trying
to kill her?

15:47.550 --> 15:49.506
- No. He swerved at the last
mInute. Probably just trying

15:49.550 --> 15:51.461
to scare her.
- It worked.

15:51.510 --> 15:53.819
- Yeah. Well, I ran
the sedan plates. Stolen.

15:53.860 --> 15:56.988
I ordered a print team, but
I wouldn't get your hopes up.

15:57.040 --> 15:59.600
- Well, call us
if you find out anything more.

15:59.650 --> 16:01.902
- OK. Um, can I... talk to you
for a second

16:01.960 --> 16:04.645
It's guy stuff.

16:04.700 --> 16:06.691
- I'll... be in the car.

16:08.920 --> 16:11.047
- Maz, I've got a headache
the size of Nunavut, man.

16:11.100 --> 16:13.489
- That's OK. Ijust, uh...
I just need a small favour.

16:13.530 --> 16:15.998
- No, it's uh...

16:16.060 --> 16:18.358
It's about Zoe.

16:18.410 --> 16:22.016
- Well, we kinda went on a date.

16:22.060 --> 16:25.496
I mean, I... at least
I think it was a date.

16:25.540 --> 16:27.974
And then, uh, I drove her home.

16:28.030 --> 16:30.282
- And...
- And I said goodnight.

16:30.330 --> 16:32.378
- And...

16:32.420 --> 16:34.854
- Then she said goodnight
and I went home.

16:34.900 --> 16:37.425
I mean,

16:37.470 --> 16:39.335
normally I would just drive
right to the hoop on that.

16:39.380 --> 16:41.905
- Yeah, I heard that about you.
- Yeah, but with Zoe it's

16:41.950 --> 16:43.815
different, you know? She's...
she's smart, she's funny.

16:43.870 --> 16:45.599
It's... I mean, there was
definitely a window,

16:45.650 --> 16:47.641
but I... froze.

16:47.700 --> 16:49.565
I didn't know what to do.
I didn't know what to say.

16:49.610 --> 16:51.999
Wow. This is serious.

16:52.050 --> 16:54.689
- Yeah. Anyway, since then
it's just been radio silence.

16:54.750 --> 16:56.706
No calls. No texts. Nothing.

16:56.750 --> 16:58.615
- Of course not!

16:58.660 --> 17:00.924
I mean, what if I misread this
whole thing? I mean, what if...

17:00.970 --> 17:05.236
and this sounds crazy, I know,
maybe she's not into me.

17:05.280 --> 17:07.453
- Well, I wouldn't panic
just yet.

17:07.500 --> 17:09.809
One thing I've learned about Zoe
is she likes routine.

17:09.850 --> 17:12.364
Maybe she just wants
to take it slow.

17:12.420 --> 17:15.116
- Yeah. Yeah. Give her some time

17:15.160 --> 17:18.721
to process
the incredible Maz-ness

17:18.770 --> 17:20.590
of it all. She'll come around.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.596
- OK.

17:22.650 --> 17:24.720
Yeah. Yeah, that's... that's...

17:24.780 --> 17:26.600
- Yeah.

17:26.650 --> 17:28.470
Good talk.

17:28.520 --> 17:30.511
- Yeah.

17:30.570 --> 17:32.913
That's good.
Maybe you are a superhero.

17:35.790 --> 17:39.260
- Take it easy.

17:39.310 --> 17:41.358
- Hey, it's not my fault
that the clutch slips.

17:41.400 --> 17:45.052
- Alright. That's it.
Pull over. I'm driving.

17:45.100 --> 17:47.364
- I am trying to do you a favour
here, OK? You just got walloped.

17:47.410 --> 17:50.459
- Oh believe me,
this hurts more.

17:50.500 --> 17:53.276
- So. You and Maz.

17:53.330 --> 17:55.412
Guy talkin'.
- Yeah, you know...

17:55.460 --> 17:57.416
chicks, fast cars, cigars.

17:57.460 --> 17:59.155
- OK, fine. Don't tell me.

17:59.200 --> 18:01.725
Ahem.

18:01.770 --> 18:03.818
- What do you bet
whoever was driving

18:03.860 --> 18:05.851
_ that black sedan
IS the same person

18:05.910 --> 18:08.640
who rigged Beth's fight?
- Easy odds.

18:08.690 --> 18:12.251
- But if Denise is too terrified
to talk, then where does
that leave us?

18:12.300 --> 18:14.086
- Well, let's go back to basics.
What's the number one reason

18:14.130 --> 18:16.655
to fix a fight?
- Money.
- Bingo.

18:16.700 --> 18:18.656
- OK. So say I place a large bet
on a fighter

18:18.700 --> 18:21.260
with long odds, i.e. Beth.
- If the underdog wins,

18:21.310 --> 18:24.393
you get a big payout.
- OK. So then we just need

18:24.450 --> 18:27.317
to figure out who made a bundle
off Beth's win.

18:27.360 --> 18:29.316
- And how do you suggest we do
that? Last time I checked,

18:29.360 --> 18:31.146
there wasn't
a "Bookie" section on Yelp.

18:33.800 --> 18:36.143
- I may know someone
who can help.

18:45.080 --> 18:48.299
- Hey, mom.
- Angie!

18:48.340 --> 18:51.855
I was so pleased
to get your call. Matthew.

18:51.910 --> 18:53.866
- Nora.
- A pleasure as always.

18:53.910 --> 18:56.993
- The pleasure's mine.
- You know, maybe this
was a bad idea after all.

18:57.040 --> 18:59.827
We don't need your help.
We can figure out

18:59.870 --> 19:01.826
something else.

19:01.870 --> 19:04.919
She thinks I'm gonna
fall off the wagon again.

19:04.960 --> 19:08.259
Honey, I have been in Gamblers
Anonymous for a year now.

19:08.320 --> 19:12.188
I'm clean. And, as a matter of
fact, I just became a sponsor.

19:12.230 --> 19:14.095
- I...

19:14.150 --> 19:16.015
didn't know that.
- Well if you called

19:16.060 --> 19:18.199
once in a while, you would know.

19:18.240 --> 19:20.845
- Sorry. I've...

19:20.890 --> 19:23.233
I've been really busy.
- Oh, busy, busy, busy.

19:23.290 --> 19:26.418
You need to_ relax. We_should
go shopping sometime.

19:26.460 --> 19:29.463
You could use some new clothes.

19:29.510 --> 19:31.899
- Or dinner. We could
go out for dInner.

19:31.950 --> 19:33.906
Bring Ken. I'm sure
he's handsome as ever.

19:33.950 --> 19:36.464
I'd love to get together
and catch up.

19:36.520 --> 19:38.681
This time, I'll...
I'll pick the restaurant though.

19:38.740 --> 19:41.436
- Uh, Nora, do you

19:41.480 --> 19:44.392
really think you can help us?
- Oh, absolutely. Yes.

19:44.440 --> 19:46.396
This is perfect, actually,

19:46.440 --> 19:50.831
because I needed
some chicken... Come on!

19:55.620 --> 19:58.271
- Nora!

19:58.320 --> 20:00.493
Oh ho ho!

20:00.540 --> 20:02.496
What a sight for sore eyes.

20:02.540 --> 20:04.496
- Been a while, Rory.
- Yeah.

20:08.070 --> 20:11.028
I got pig ears and chicken feet,
but I got a helluva juicy rump.

20:12.950 --> 20:14.895
- That's our old joke.

20:14.950 --> 20:17.248
- Funny.
- Ahem.

20:17.300 --> 20:19.643
That's, um, my daughter, Angie.

20:19.690 --> 20:22.386
- Of course she is. Look at her.

20:22.430 --> 20:24.386
You're gorgeous,
just like your mother.

20:24.440 --> 20:28.171
- And her friend, Matt Shade.

20:28.220 --> 20:30.609
- Yeah, that's right.
Why, you a fan?

20:30.660 --> 20:33.436
- I was... up until
that playoff in Seattle.

20:33.490 --> 20:35.833
What a mess. I lost a bundle

20:35.880 --> 20:37.791
'cause of that goal
you scored in overtime.

20:37.840 --> 20:40.832
- I don't like to lose.

20:46.240 --> 20:47.889
- It's a bloody mess.

20:52.030 --> 20:54.248
- Not this business.

20:54.290 --> 20:56.372
- Nora, I didn't know
that you were still in the game.

20:56.420 --> 20:58.593
- Oh, I'm not. I'm not,

20:58.640 --> 21:01.108
but my daughter
needs some information.

21:01.170 --> 21:03.513
- My partner and I
are private investigators.

21:03.560 --> 21:05.733
- Nora... I don't
know about this.

21:05.780 --> 21:08.772
- You can trust them. I promise.

21:10.740 --> 21:12.731
- OK...

21:12.790 --> 21:15.304
- You run a bookie joint

21:15.360 --> 21:18.318
out of the back of your shop?
- No. I don't.

21:18.360 --> 21:20.669
- Right. Got it.

21:20.710 --> 21:22.666
- OK, let's see.

21:22.710 --> 21:25.793
Here we go. Perez versus Jacobs.

21:25.840 --> 21:28.013
- No.

21:28.060 --> 21:31.803
There was one big loser, though.
Well, that's
interesting.

21:31.850 --> 21:33.761
- Because maybe Denise's

21:33.810 --> 21:37.109
attacker wasn't her blackmailer.
- Maybe he was a high roller

21:37.160 --> 21:39.765
that got fleeced
when the favourite took a dive.

21:39.820 --> 21:41.720
- And if that
was a revenge attack,

21:41.770 --> 21:43.726
then Beth could be next
on his list.

21:43.780 --> 21:45.463
- Look at you. You are
your mother's daughter.

21:45.520 --> 21:47.124
- So, does this big loser
have a name?

21:47.170 --> 21:50.697
- Yeah, uh... Elvis.
- Not his real name.

21:50.740 --> 21:52.605
- But luckily the guy's
gonna come by tonight

21:52.650 --> 21:54.470
to settle up his debt, so...

21:56.830 --> 21:59.355
- "What if he doesn't show!"

22:03.010 --> 22:04.966
- Nobody likes

22:05.010 --> 22:07.012
to disappoint Rory.

22:17.940 --> 22:20.670
- Hey. Looks like we're about to
have our first Elvis sighting.

22:20.730 --> 22:23.460
- And we've got
a front row seat.

22:27.210 --> 22:29.724
It's too dark.
I can't see who it is.

22:29.780 --> 22:33.250
Come on, let's go.

22:41.270 --> 22:44.353
MURRAY?!

22:55.930 --> 22:57.886
- Look, Shadow...

22:57.940 --> 23:00.329
This is not what it looks like.

23:00.370 --> 23:02.588
'Cause it looks
pretty bad.

23:02.640 --> 23:04.631
- Alright. If you need me,

23:04.680 --> 23:06.728
I'll be in the back...

23:06.770 --> 23:09.819
sharpening my knives.
- So you're Elvis.

23:09.860 --> 23:11.725
Isn't it illegal
for managers to bet on fights?

23:11.780 --> 23:13.736
- Can't wait _
to hear you spin this.

23:16.040 --> 23:18.952
- OK, Shadow. I made a bet
on a fight.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.956
- No, Murray! You bet against

23:21.000 --> 23:23.309
your own fighter. You remember,

23:23.350 --> 23:25.739
the one with "the honest heart"?
- And the dishonest manager.

23:25.790 --> 23:28.782
- Beth trusts you
to take care of her inside

23:28.840 --> 23:30.660
and outside of the ring.
You violated that trust.

23:30.710 --> 23:33.611
- You're right. Yeah.

23:33.670 --> 23:36.184
I'm ashamed.

23:36.240 --> 23:39.585
She's the best thing
that's ever happened to me...

23:39.630 --> 23:42.235
since you.

23:42.290 --> 23:44.633
- Please tell me you had nothing
to do with the attack on Denise.

23:44.680 --> 23:46.500
- I swear on my mother's grave.

23:46.550 --> 23:48.415
- Your mother's still alive!

23:48.470 --> 23:51.030
- She has one foot in the grave.

23:53.510 --> 23:56.729
Look, why would I attack Denise?

23:56.780 --> 23:59.681
I wouldn't get my money back.

23:59.740 --> 24:02.038
- Maybe you were afraid we'd
convinced her to come clean.

24:02.090 --> 24:04.342
- Look, Shadow...

24:04.390 --> 24:06.392
I might be a lot of things,

24:06.440 --> 24:09.876
but I'm not a killer
and you know that.

24:18.710 --> 24:21.053
- Hey!
- Hey.

24:23.500 --> 24:26.014
- That magical jar of peanut
butter is calling my name,

24:26.070 --> 24:27.970
but...

24:28.030 --> 24:30.066
I am resisting.

24:30.120 --> 24:32.930
- Hm... Is there something
on your mind? Wait.

24:35.340 --> 24:37.501
- None of my business.

24:37.560 --> 24:39.380
- We went for coffee.
- OK...

24:39.430 --> 24:41.386
As in... a date?

24:41.430 --> 24:44.297
- No. Maybe.

24:44.350 --> 24:46.773
I don't know.
- You don't know

24:46.830 --> 24:49.651
if it was a date?
- Well, I thought it was
a date. It felt like a date.

24:49.700 --> 24:52.043
- Afterwards,

24:52.090 --> 24:55.446
he drove me home.
We said goodnight.

24:55.490 --> 24:59.005
- And...
- That's about it.

24:59.060 --> 25:02.405
- I thought maybe
he'd make the first move.

25:02.450 --> 25:05.362
- Oh. And he didn't.
- No.

25:05.410 --> 25:07.935
And after that, it's just been
me and the peanut butter.

25:07.980 --> 25:11.154
I'm thinking of switching
to chunlq style.

25:11.200 --> 25:12.895
- OK. Whoa. Let's not do
anything drastic.

25:12.940 --> 25:15.374
Has he at least called?

25:18.030 --> 25:20.032
Oh...

25:20.080 --> 25:22.548
- You've been there.

25:22.600 --> 25:24.556
- Zoe, everybody has been there.

25:24.610 --> 25:26.862
It's just...
part of the dating game.

25:26.910 --> 25:30.346
You don't want to be the first
one to call. _You're not sure
If he's Into you...

25:30.390 --> 25:33.302
What did he say?

25:33.350 --> 25:35.170
- Nothing! Nothing.
- OK, but you guys are friends,

25:35.220 --> 25:37.654
so... What's your best guess?

25:37.710 --> 25:41.350
- Maz is probably taking it slow
because he likes you.

25:41.400 --> 25:43.743
That sort of scares some guys.

25:43.800 --> 25:46.576
Just... play it cool
for a while.

25:46.630 --> 25:48.791
Give him a little time to...

25:48.850 --> 25:51.318
work up the courage
to ask you out again.

25:56.160 --> 25:58.287
- That's it.

25:58.330 --> 26:00.469
And until then,

26:00.510 --> 26:02.592
you know what's better
than peanut butter?

26:06.650 --> 26:08.641
Scotch.

26:26.840 --> 26:28.922
- Lookin' good, champ.
- Thanks.

26:28.970 --> 26:31.234
I feel strong.
- Well, uh...

26:31.280 --> 26:33.714
That's all that matters.

26:36.240 --> 26:38.800
- Why do I feel you guys are
softening me up for a body shot?

26:38.850 --> 26:41.978
- Beth... we've, uh...
run out of leads.

26:42.030 --> 26:45.466
We may never be able to prove
if the fight was fixed or not.

26:45.510 --> 26:48.115
- I'll go talk to Denise myself.
- Even if you could find her,

26:48.170 --> 26:50.468
she's not gonna talk to you.
- The championship match

26:50.520 --> 26:52.647
is tomorrow night.
I need the truth.

26:52.690 --> 26:55.341
Am I the real deal,
or just some stooge?

26:55.390 --> 26:58.086
- Hey. You're the real deal,
kid. You've got all the tools.

26:58.130 --> 27:00.519
- Everyone says I won't make it
past the first round.

27:00.570 --> 27:03.482
I don't stand a chance.

27:03.530 --> 27:05.782
What if they're right?
What if I'm not good enough?

27:05.840 --> 27:08.525
- Hey, Beth.
You love boxing, right?

27:08.580 --> 27:10.184
- More than anything
in the world.

27:12.630 --> 27:14.791
- 'Cause...

27:14.850 --> 27:17.068
everything makes sense
when I get in the ring.

27:17.110 --> 27:19.806
- Well, then you get in that
ring and you prove to everyone
that you are good enough.

27:19.850 --> 27:22.284
- Shade's right. If you win
the title bout, no one

27:22.330 --> 27:25.413
is gonna care if that fight
with Denise was rigged or not.

27:27.860 --> 27:30.203
- Nothing you can't handle.

27:30.250 --> 27:32.718
- Thanks, guys.

27:32.780 --> 27:35.123
I'm gonna go hit the showers.

27:40.870 --> 27:44.306
- HEY! Jacobs! What the hell

27:44.350 --> 27:46.659
are you playin' at?
- Get out of my face!

27:46.700 --> 27:48.520
- I'm gonna kick your ass
in the ring tomorrow.

27:48.570 --> 27:51.528
So you can take your candy ass
threats and shove 'em!

27:51.580 --> 27:54.879
- Hey, hey! Ladies, ladies!
- What the f...
- Cool it. Cool it. Come on.

27:54.930 --> 27:56.830
- Take a dive in the fourth

27:56.890 --> 27:59.108
and make 10 grand.
Don't be a hero.

27:59.150 --> 28:01.710
- I found that in my locker.

28:01.760 --> 28:05.321
- You didn't deserve to qualify,
and you know you don't stand
a chance with me in the ring.

28:05.370 --> 28:07.634
- You're crazy.
- Better crazy than a cheater.

28:07.680 --> 28:09.853
- Cut it out!
- Ladies!

28:09.900 --> 28:12.505
- I'm not taking any dive.!

28:12.560 --> 28:15.245
Better get ready,
'cause you goin' down.

28:26.400 --> 28:29.437
- Has it occurred to you that
someone's maneuvering our client

28:29.490 --> 28:32.220
to win the title?
- I was thinking the same thing.

28:32.270 --> 28:35.228
First Denise takes a dive,
allowing Beth to move up

28:35.270 --> 28:38.398
to the championship.
- And then Cynthia's offered a
bribe to go down in the fourth.

28:38.450 --> 28:40.441
- So the title bout
was the real goal all along.

28:40.500 --> 28:42.718
Man, someone's playing

28:42.760 --> 28:45.103
a long game,
hoping to cash in big time.

28:45.150 --> 28:48.233
- What do you think they're
gonna do when they find out
that Cynthia won't tumble?

28:48.290 --> 28:51.282
- There's a lot money at stake.
They may get desperate.

28:51.330 --> 28:54.595
- I was afraid you'd say that.

28:54.640 --> 28:57.598
- You have got to be kidding me.

28:57.640 --> 29:00.461
- I shouldn't have told you.
- That son of bitch Murray

29:00.520 --> 29:02.681
bets against his own client?

29:02.740 --> 29:04.549
And he's drags you
into the middle of this mess?

29:04.610 --> 29:06.862
I could kill him.

29:06.910 --> 29:09.788
- Yeah, wouldn't help.
After the apocalypse,

29:09.830 --> 29:11.912
Murray'll still be here with
the rest of the cockroaches.

29:11.960 --> 29:13.916
- You know, I never should have

29:13.960 --> 29:15.871
let that scumbag take you
under his wing.

29:15.920 --> 29:18.059
All that time
gaInIng your trust,

29:18.100 --> 29:20.705
just waiting to rob you blind.
- It takes two to tango, Dad.

29:20.750 --> 29:23.492
Murray was there for me
when I needed him.

29:23.540 --> 29:26.452
- I didn't say that.

29:26.500 --> 29:28.934
- Yeah, you kinda did.

29:28.980 --> 29:30.936
- Um...

29:30.980 --> 29:35.246
I did not mean
what you think I meant.

29:35.290 --> 29:38.817
- All those years, I stayed home
to work. I was making money

29:38.860 --> 29:41.374
so that you could have a shot.
- Yeah, I know that, Dad.
And I appreciate it.

29:41.430 --> 29:43.386
- Yeah, so what are you
doing here, Matt?

29:43.430 --> 29:45.386
I watched that guy drag you
through the wringer once.

29:45.430 --> 29:47.125
I'm not gonna
let it happen again.

29:49.870 --> 29:51.428
- I've got the situation
under control.

29:51.480 --> 29:54.438
- I hope you do.

29:57.230 --> 30:00.006
Hey, guys...

30:00.050 --> 30:02.189
Looks like the press conference
has already started.

30:02.230 --> 30:04.539
- before fight time.
And her opponent:

30:04.580 --> 30:07.538
current Bantamweight champion,

30:07.580 --> 30:09.889
Cynthia "The Hammer" Flores.

30:09.930 --> 30:12.069
- She still looks angry.

30:12.110 --> 30:14.237
- She was born angry.

30:14.290 --> 30:16.235
- Cyn! You were training to fight Denise Perez. What was

30:16.290 --> 30:18.246
your reaction when Beth
got the unexpected win?

30:18.290 --> 30:20.542
- Pity. Now I gotta
kill this kid.

30:20.600 --> 30:22.545
- Beth Jacobs.
There were rumours

30:22.600 --> 30:25.467
you were going to back out of this fight. Are you still in?

30:25.510 --> 30:27.466
- I'm going to fight.

30:27.520 --> 30:30.387
And I'm leaving with the title.

30:30.430 --> 30:32.864
- Gotta admit, she's got spunk.
- She's gonna need

30:32.910 --> 30:34.730
more than that.
- This is five-time heavyweight

30:34.780 --> 30:37.908
champion, and two-time world
heavyweight title contender...

30:37.960 --> 30:40.690
the one and only George Chuvalo.

30:40.750 --> 30:44.095
George, what do you think
of the underdog's chances?

30:44.140 --> 30:47.189
- Well, I know
why she's the underdog,

30:47.230 --> 30:49.221
because she's fighting
one heck of a fighter.

30:49.280 --> 30:51.498
The champion
has a terrific record,

30:51.540 --> 30:54.532
and is extremely difficult to fight because she is a southpaw.

30:57.070 --> 30:59.026
You ever try to shake hands
with your left? It totally

30:59.070 --> 31:01.766
throws you off.
- Definitely. You're always...

31:01.810 --> 31:04.597
What is it?
- Well, in the allewNay,

31:04.640 --> 31:06.688
the guy who hit me,
he was a southpaw too.

31:06.730 --> 31:09.858
- You... you don't
think it could've been Cyn?
- No, it was definitely a man.

31:09.910 --> 31:11.866
He_ had at least
SIX Inches on her.

31:11.910 --> 31:13.866
But he hit like a pro.

31:13.910 --> 31:16.868
Or maybe... an ex

31:21.660 --> 31:25.391
Anytime, Everett!

31:25.440 --> 31:27.396
The fights are gonna start soon.

31:27.450 --> 31:29.702
- And voila!

31:32.360 --> 31:34.499
- "The Fastest Southpaw
in the Golden Horseshoe."

31:38.540 --> 31:40.360
- Hank owns the gym,

31:40.420 --> 31:42.229
so why would he
start fixing fights?

31:42.290 --> 31:44.372
- Look at these bills...

31:44.420 --> 31:47.503
electricity, rent, car payment.
All months overdue.

31:47.550 --> 31:49.506
- Judging by his last
bank statement, I think

31:49.550 --> 31:51.461
Hank has tanked.
- A big payday

31:51.510 --> 31:53.558
would get his head
above water again.

31:53.600 --> 31:55.124
- Yeah, but he's
taking a big chance,

31:55.170 --> 31:57.161
risking everything. I mean,

31:57.210 --> 31:59.030
there's no guarantee
that Beth will even win tonight.

32:04.270 --> 32:08.309
- Maybe there is.

32:08.360 --> 32:10.169
- Looks like Hank's
got a little insurance policy.

32:10.230 --> 32:14.269
- Yeah. He's injected metal

32:14.320 --> 32:16.185
into her gloves. I think Hank's
planning to turn our client

32:16.230 --> 32:18.539
into a murder weapon.

32:21.410 --> 32:23.275
- A huge crowd has gathered

32:23.330 --> 32:26.288
tonight and they're ready for a fight. It's the old story

32:26.330 --> 32:28.503
of an underdog newcomer
up against a seasoned pro

32:28.550 --> 32:31.417
and what might happen
is anybody's guess!

32:47.090 --> 32:48.910
- You got this, girl!

32:56.970 --> 32:59.575
- Ladies and gentlemen,

32:59.620 --> 33:01.576
welcome to tonight's
regional championship

33:01.630 --> 33:03.666
main event. Tonight's official

33:03.720 --> 33:06.496
is Megan Carr.

33:06.540 --> 33:09.668
- In the blue corner,
our reigning champion, weighing

33:09.720 --> 33:11.540
135 pounds,

33:11.590 --> 33:15.117
Cynthia Flores!

33:15.160 --> 33:18.687
- And in the red corner,
weighing 132 pounds,

33:18.730 --> 33:20.686
Beth Jacobs!

33:20.730 --> 33:22.948
- OK, ladies...

33:23.000 --> 33:25.218
anything landing on the belt,
I'll rule as low.

33:25.260 --> 33:30.038
Fight clean. Fight well.
And good luck. Touch gloves.

33:30.090 --> 33:32.399
- Come on,
my million dollar baby!

33:36.050 --> 33:38.006
- I'm thinkin'

33:38.050 --> 33:40.006
she is one brave girl.

33:40.060 --> 33:41.743
I just hope that's
enough to keep her safe.

33:45.500 --> 33:47.627
- We are seconds away from the
opening bell on what promises

33:47.670 --> 33:49.626
to be a very exciting match.

33:49.670 --> 33:52.366
- I got this.

33:52.420 --> 33:54.502
- She's green and she's scared.

33:54.550 --> 33:56.939
- And she's going down.

33:56.990 --> 33:58.935
- Both ladies look primed
for battle here, George.

33:58.990 --> 34:01.151
- Well, the talk
around the ring this evening

34:01.210 --> 34:03.337
leads me to believe that Jacobs
IS gonna have a problem

34:03.380 --> 34:05.996
going the distance.
- Jacobs, yes.

34:06.040 --> 34:08.383
- Maybe we should've told her.
- No, it just would have messed

34:08.430 --> 34:10.341
with her head.
She needs to stay focused.

34:10.390 --> 34:12.608
- OK.

34:12.650 --> 34:14.789
So when do we make our move?
- Not yet.

34:14.830 --> 34:17.913
- BOX!
- And there's the bell!

34:17.960 --> 34:19.916
And the main event

34:19.970 --> 34:22.052
is underway,
both fighters exploding

34:22.100 --> 34:24.318
out of their corners.
Jacobs gIVIng Flores

34:24.360 --> 34:26.578
a wide berth. Looks like she's

34:26.620 --> 34:29.180
playing it safe off the top.

34:29.240 --> 34:31.322
Flores is not out of the corner and she's not standing still.

34:31.370 --> 34:35.101
A jab. Another jab!
Jacobs moving in fast and hard.

34:35.160 --> 34:37.628
She's got Flores backed up
into the red corner,

34:37.680 --> 34:40.114
and she's not letting up.

34:40.160 --> 34:43.118
Flores is taking her time.
Letting Jacobs whale on her,
start to wear herself out.

34:43.160 --> 34:46.209
A common mistake
among young fighters.

34:46.250 --> 34:48.206
They start off hard and fast,
giving it everything

34:48.260 --> 34:50.820
they've got, to find out
they can't go the distance.

34:50.870 --> 34:53.509
- Damn.
- Beth's making a comeback.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.525
- That's it! That's it!
Set her up! Set her up!

34:58.570 --> 35:00.879
- TIME!

35:00.920 --> 35:04.003
- And there's the bell.
Looks like rookie Jacobs

35:04.050 --> 35:06.610
has made it
past the first round.

35:06.660 --> 35:10.050
And we're into the second round.

35:10.100 --> 35:12.148
Jacobs coming out strong,

35:12.190 --> 35:14.750
and it looks like her opponent
is as shocked as we are.

35:18.680 --> 35:21.979
- She's starting to sag now.
- Nah. It's too early
to get tired.

35:22.030 --> 35:24.806
- It's the old rope-a-dope.

35:24.860 --> 35:26.851
Beth's lettin' Cyn
tire herself out.

35:26.900 --> 35:28.504
- For someone with their client
on the ropes,

35:28.560 --> 35:31.120
you seem pretty relaxed.

35:31.170 --> 35:33.161
- Murray, you didn't!

35:33.210 --> 35:36.600
- You're nuts.

35:36.650 --> 35:39.380
- You bet against your
client again?

35:39.440 --> 35:42.603
- I'm sorry, buddy. I tried.

35:44.700 --> 35:46.839
Leopard can't change his spots.
- You're no leopard, Murray.

35:46.880 --> 35:49.007
You're a weasel.

35:49.050 --> 35:50.927
- Looks like Flores has decided
to stake out her territory.

35:50.970 --> 35:53.837
She's hitting back
and hitting hard.

35:53.890 --> 35:56.973
This is one lady who has
the power to do just that.

35:57.020 --> 35:59.147
This has been
an amazmg match so far.

35:59.200 --> 36:01.361
No one expected
Jacobs to make it

36:01.420 --> 36:03.843
this far,
least of all her opponent.

36:03.900 --> 36:06.676
Round three and Flores
is coming back hard and strong.

36:06.720 --> 36:09.416
She'll be feeling
that one later this week.

36:09.470 --> 36:12.109
She's got sizzling hand speed,
butJacobs

36:12.170 --> 36:13.899
is absorbing the blows.
But it looks

36:13.950 --> 36:16.293
like they're taking their toll.

36:16.340 --> 36:18.205
And things are not

36:18.260 --> 36:20.774
looking good for Beth Jacobs.

36:23.260 --> 36:26.081
And we're back in the fourth,

36:26.140 --> 36:27.471
both fighters
stalking each other,

36:27.530 --> 36:30.226
looking for an opening.

36:30.270 --> 36:34.092
- Let's go talk to Hank.
Let's go.

36:34.140 --> 36:37.701
Flores is trying
to make Jacobs come to her.

36:37.760 --> 36:40.536
Flores is back in the game.

36:40.580 --> 36:42.889
She's moving in with
a series of jackhammer jabs.

36:42.930 --> 36:46.229
Beth Jacobs
has the heart of a lion.

36:46.290 --> 36:48.588
This girl just won't give up.
- Cyn's really comin' on.

36:48.640 --> 36:51.245
- Looks like it might not be
Beth's time after all.

36:51.290 --> 36:54.020
- I mean, it's not like you bet

36:54.080 --> 36:57.299
a wad on Beth winning the title.

36:57.340 --> 36:59.558
- Sure, the huge odds
must've tempting.

36:59.600 --> 37:02.774
But that would be crazy, right?
You said yourself she's
the underdog.

37:02.820 --> 37:05.778
- Unless you figured out some
way to guarantee the outcome.

37:05.830 --> 37:08.731
- Only you didn't have anything
on Cyn like you did on Denise,

37:08.790 --> 37:10.519
which is why you tried
to bribe her.

37:12.830 --> 37:15.355
What are you
talking about?

37:15.400 --> 37:18.312
- Jacobs is trying to get away
as Flores reaches

37:18.360 --> 37:19.531
with her right hand again.

37:19.580 --> 37:21.753
- Come on, Beth!

37:21.800 --> 37:23.665
- The ref moves in again, breaks
them up, starts the count,

37:23.710 --> 37:27.840
but Jacobs is determined.
- I'm good! I got this!
- BOX!

37:31.030 --> 37:34.454
- Gonna be a close one, Hank.
- We know you're deep in debt

37:34.510 --> 37:36.239
and you could actually
lose your gym.

37:38.990 --> 37:41.117
- It's an old ﬁghter trick,

37:41.170 --> 37:42.899
right, Hank? You inject
the gloves with mercury.

37:42.950 --> 37:45.680
Liquid metal. Turns 'em
into battering rams.

37:45.740 --> 37:48.607
- Beth wouldn't re_alize
her gloves were rigged
until it was too late.

37:48.650 --> 37:51.118
If they didn't stop the fight
in time, it could turn lethal.

37:51.180 --> 37:52.909
- Of course, that was the way
it was supposed to play out.

37:52.960 --> 37:55.872
But we called ahead
and changed Beth's gloves

37:55.920 --> 37:58.138
right before the fight.

37:58.180 --> 37:59.875
- Beth is gonna win or lose
this title on her own terms.

37:59.920 --> 38:02.138
- Which is all she ever wanted.

38:02.190 --> 38:04.920
- Right hook followed by a left.
The punch connects!

38:04.970 --> 38:07.575
Jacobs strikes back
but Flores lands one.

38:07.630 --> 38:10.622
WHOA! Jacobs is hit hard!

38:10.670 --> 38:12.979
She definitely felt that one!

38:13.020 --> 38:15.193
Looks like things just got real.
The ref is moving in.

38:15.240 --> 38:17.549
Yes, Jacobs has been cut.

38:17.590 --> 38:20.718
We're waiting for the ruling...
and there it is!

38:20.770 --> 38:24.558
The fight is over!

38:24.600 --> 38:28.479
And it looks like we have
our wmner

38:28.520 --> 38:30.863
by technical knockout,
Cynthia Flores!

38:30.910 --> 38:34.300
Unbelievable! The champion
maintains her belt,

38:34.350 --> 38:36.602
but the underdog made it
way further than predicted.

38:36.660 --> 38:39.049
We had her going down in the
first round, but she not only

38:39.090 --> 38:42.002
made it all the way
to the fourth, she gave
the champ a run for her money!

38:42.050 --> 38:44.393
- We've got your fingerprints

38:44.450 --> 38:46.224
on the mercury bottle,
the syringe, and the gloves.

38:46.280 --> 38:48.145
- Listen...

38:48.190 --> 38:50.795
Maybe we can make a deal.
- No.

38:50.850 --> 38:53.318
Not this time.

38:53.370 --> 38:55.418
The only deal you're gonna
be makin' is a plea bargain.

39:10.950 --> 39:14.169
- I'm sorry. I feel like
I let you guys down.

39:14.220 --> 39:16.029
- Not at all.

39:16.090 --> 39:17.910
You gave it your best shot
and you fought

39:17.960 --> 39:19.996
fair and square.
- And I lost.

39:20.050 --> 39:22.006
- Just one battle. Not the war.

39:22.050 --> 39:23.961
- And you never went down!

39:24.010 --> 39:25.966
You proved yourself
out there tonight.

39:26.010 --> 39:28.399
But the most important thing is,

39:28.450 --> 39:31.442
your name has been cleared.
- To think I trusted Hank

39:31.490 --> 39:34.926
and Murray... All they were
doing was using me.

39:34.980 --> 39:37.403
- Take it from me, Beth.
Put all that in the rear view.

39:37.460 --> 39:39.325
Talent like yours?

39:39.370 --> 39:41.190
Anything is possible.

39:41.240 --> 39:44.892
- Thank you guys...
for everything.

39:48.510 --> 39:50.558
- Don't put those pens away
just yet!

39:50.600 --> 39:53.854
- Hey Maz!

39:53.910 --> 39:55.605
- All I need's your John Hancock
and we can close this file.

39:55.650 --> 39:59.643
- Ahem. Detective.
- Hello.

40:01.700 --> 40:04.089
- Well!

40:04.140 --> 40:06.085
Uh... time for me to go.

40:06.140 --> 40:09.041
Got some big plans

40:09.100 --> 40:11.091
with my peeps
on the Ossington Strip.

40:11.140 --> 40:13.665
- Oh, "peeps."
That's a coincidence,

40:13.710 --> 40:15.758
'cause as _soon
as Angie finishes...

40:15.800 --> 40:18.792
Yeah, I'm headin'
to the East End for cop-aoke.

40:18.850 --> 40:21.580
That's cop karaoke. It's...

40:24.370 --> 40:27.419
Excuse me. Please enjoy
your... uh, social event.

40:27.460 --> 40:30.634
- You as well.

40:34.120 --> 40:36.941
- Night!
- Well, that was

40:36.990 --> 40:39.299
painfully awkward.

40:41.520 --> 40:43.476
- It's a shame
when two people can't see

40:43.520 --> 40:45.476
what's right in front of them,
don't you think?

40:45.530 --> 40:47.475
- Ah, it's a damn shame.

40:47.530 --> 40:50.397
Say hi to Mel.
- Yeah. Say hi to Ken!

41:07.900 --> 41:09.936
- Hey...

41:09.980 --> 41:11.936
buddy!

41:11.990 --> 41:15.505
Uh... Shame about Beth.

41:15.560 --> 41:18.165
- Yeah, I can see
you're all busted up

41:18.210 --> 41:21.509
about it. How much money
did you make on her opponent?

41:21.560 --> 41:23.516
- Ahh! A mere pittance.

41:23.560 --> 41:27.564
Hey, if this about your money...

41:27.610 --> 41:30.477
now maybe I can pay back
some of what I owe you.

41:30.530 --> 41:32.919
I just gotta find
a couple of tax loopholes,

41:32.960 --> 41:36.134
slide some into--
- Save it, Murray.
You don't have any money.

41:36.180 --> 41:38.523
- I told Rory

41:38.580 --> 41:41.481
to pay out your winnings
to Beth directly,

41:41.540 --> 41:43.531
to pay for her training.

41:47.670 --> 41:49.979
- If the commission finds out

41:50.020 --> 41:52.500
that you were betting on
or against your fighter,

41:52.550 --> 41:54.506
they'll blackball you for life.

41:54.550 --> 41:57.246
- Wait a minute.
What's this about, Shadow?

41:59.560 --> 42:01.551
- I got Beth a new manager.

42:01.600 --> 42:03.556
Someone she can trust.

42:05.820 --> 42:07.640
- Because of all
we've been through!

42:07.690 --> 42:10.033
- Oh, come on.

42:10.090 --> 42:12.081
Look, I know you're pissed
about the money--

42:12.130 --> 42:14.781
Actually, I'm not.

42:14.830 --> 42:17.219
That was a long time ago.

42:17.270 --> 42:19.226
But this isn't about the money.

42:19.270 --> 42:20.874
This is about doing
the right thing for Beth.

42:25.450 --> 42:28.715
- You always were a sap.

42:28.760 --> 42:32.400
So, uh...

42:32.460 --> 42:34.712
What is this

42:34.760 --> 42:37.581
- Yeah, it's starting
to look that way.

42:41.860 --> 42:44.203
- I'd offer you some, Clavin,

42:44.250 --> 42:45.979
but I know you can't stay.

42:48.520 --> 42:50.738
- Take care of yourself, Shadow.

42:50.780 --> 42:52.645
I'll see you around.

42:52.700 --> 42:54.952
- Not ifI see you first.

43:00.620 --> 43:03.088
- Listen, son,
about what I said before...

43:03.140 --> 43:05.392
- Forget it, dad.
- I was just upset.

43:05.450 --> 43:08.055
- Hey, dad, you may not
have been there in person.

43:08.100 --> 43:10.705
But... all I ever
wanted to do was...

43:10.760 --> 43:12.978
make you proud of me.

43:13.020 --> 43:14.885
That's what spurred me on.
That's what kept me goin'.

43:14.940 --> 43:16.623
- Don't be an ass.
I was always proud.

43:16.680 --> 43:20.502
I am proud.

43:25.420 --> 43:27.149
- Let me try to let go

43:29.250 --> 43:31.070
I've got a long way

43:31.130 --> 43:32.939
To get to you

43:35.560 --> 43:41.396
Let me try to let go
