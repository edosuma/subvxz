WEBVTT

00:20.208 --> 00:21.125
Don't worry about that.

00:21.208 --> 00:24.708
The fact that Gambino was Ester's lover
is the least of our problems, Salvo.

00:24.791 --> 00:25.666
Sit down.

00:33.625 --> 00:35.958
In <i>The Touch of the Killer,</i>

00:36.041 --> 00:39.500
the killer's wife
is the notary's lover.

00:39.583 --> 00:40.791
Shh.

00:40.875 --> 00:43.458
Don't listen to them, Salvo.
Don't listen to them.

00:43.541 --> 00:47.541
We're in deep now. We've got
the gun, the body, and the motive.

00:47.625 --> 00:49.833
They'll think we killed him,
and you even said it yourself

00:49.916 --> 00:51.916
that murders are almost always
committed by relatives

00:52.000 --> 00:53.916
just like in that show
you were talking about.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
But I didn't even know him.

00:56.083 --> 00:57.708
But Ester knew him, though.

01:03.458 --> 01:07.333
- My Ester.

01:18.708 --> 01:20.750
Salvo, we have
to get out of here.

01:20.833 --> 01:22.625
Ester could get here at any moment.

01:22.708 --> 01:24.875
- I know. I can't do this.
- You can do it, Salvo. Come on.

01:24.958 --> 01:26.416
- Let's go, Salvo.
- I can't do it.

01:26.500 --> 01:27.416
Come on. Let's go.

01:27.500 --> 01:30.541
You need to go back to thinking like
the killer in <i>The Touch of the Killer.</i>

01:30.625 --> 01:32.416
- Grab the bag.
- Wait. What bag?

01:35.708 --> 01:36.625
Let's go.

01:39.416 --> 01:41.166
Good morning.

01:41.250 --> 01:45.958
We've come to bring God
into your home.

02:09.125 --> 02:12.458
It's a big crowd in here already,
and we're kind of busy at the moment.

02:12.541 --> 02:17.375
If it's not a good time, then it just
means we have arrived right on time.

02:17.458 --> 02:21.208
"Cast all your anxiety on Him,
because He cares for you."

02:21.291 --> 02:23.416
Peter, 5-7.

02:23.500 --> 02:28.166
The Lord seeks you,
and now we have found you!

02:28.250 --> 02:30.708
Mama, I want to go back to school.

02:30.791 --> 02:33.125
Uh, come in, before they find us too.
Come in.

02:33.208 --> 02:35.208
- Who's they?
- You know, they!

02:37.041 --> 02:39.708
I told you that you can go
back to school once the strike is over.

02:39.791 --> 02:41.583
What's a strike?

02:41.666 --> 02:45.416
A strike is when people
don't go to work so that they can protest.

02:45.500 --> 02:47.708
- Why do they protest?
- Are you Mr. Gambino?

02:49.166 --> 02:51.416
Uh, no, I am Mr. Gambino.

02:51.500 --> 02:53.000
Sorry, are you Buddhists?

02:53.083 --> 02:55.958
No, we're not Buddhists.
Please put that down. I beg you.

02:56.041 --> 02:58.875
We've just finished cleaning,
and I'm telling you for your own sake.

02:58.958 --> 03:01.500
I can see that you're suffering, brother.

03:01.583 --> 03:05.000
But you mustn't despair
because God is always with us

03:05.083 --> 03:07.625
and protects us in difficult times.

03:07.708 --> 03:08.875
I get it. You do yoga.

03:09.625 --> 03:11.458
Oh God.

03:12.875 --> 03:15.791
Mr. Gambino, what's going on
with your friend over there?

03:15.875 --> 03:19.125
Um, a heartbreak involving a woman.

03:19.208 --> 03:21.583
Ah, so love.

03:21.666 --> 03:23.916
It's about love.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.541
Take shelter in God, friend,

03:25.625 --> 03:28.083
because "man without God at his side

03:28.166 --> 03:32.375
but who is born of woman
is few on days and full of trouble."

03:32.458 --> 03:34.541
Yeah, me.

03:34.625 --> 03:36.875
Job, 14-1.

03:38.083 --> 03:40.083
You must've settled down.

03:40.166 --> 03:43.000
Do you have a girlfriend?
Are you married, huh?

03:43.083 --> 03:45.875
No, I don't have a girlfriend or a wife.

03:45.958 --> 03:47.500
But you are in love.

03:47.583 --> 03:49.041
I can see it in your eyes.

03:49.125 --> 03:50.958
What do my eyes have to do with anything?

03:51.041 --> 03:54.875
Well, anyways, it appears
that God knows where we live now.

03:54.958 --> 03:57.125
He can come see us anytime.
That's no problem.

03:57.208 --> 03:59.041
He's welcome to come hang out.

03:59.125 --> 04:02.708
But then, the important thing is
that He can't touch anything.

04:02.791 --> 04:05.791
Otherwise, He'll leave His fingerprints,
and His are huge.

04:05.875 --> 04:08.541
Excuse me, Brother Gambino,
can I use your bathroom?

04:08.625 --> 04:09.750
No!

04:10.375 --> 04:11.916
Colleague. Uh?

04:13.791 --> 04:15.833
It's clogged. Because it's clogged.

04:15.916 --> 04:19.083
I'm the owner, right?
And I should know if it's clogged.

04:19.166 --> 04:20.291
Some handymen were here.

04:20.375 --> 04:22.708
They tried to fix it,
but they couldn't do it.

04:22.791 --> 04:26.666
Ah, we met them at the entrance.
Lovely gentlemen.

04:26.750 --> 04:28.833
They were laughing and singing.

04:29.458 --> 04:31.125
But who knows why?

04:31.208 --> 04:35.208
I know why. I know why.

04:36.041 --> 04:39.500
Well, I'm sorry to break this up
since we're having so much fun,

04:39.583 --> 04:41.041
but it's getting late.

04:44.500 --> 04:47.541
There's never any parking here ever!

04:48.375 --> 04:50.791
And so may the Lord always be with you.

04:50.875 --> 04:54.125
And remember, you need
to educate your children well,

04:54.208 --> 04:57.625
because the success of a child
depends on its parents.

04:58.708 --> 05:00.875
Goodbye, Mr. Gambino.

05:00.958 --> 05:02.541
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

05:02.625 --> 05:03.666
Goodbye.

05:06.083 --> 05:08.958
Come on! Hurry!
Ester's gonna be here any minute now.

05:09.041 --> 05:10.958
You know, I think she's right, though.

05:11.041 --> 05:13.708
If your mother had raised
you and your sister better,

05:13.791 --> 05:15.083
none of this would be happening.

05:15.166 --> 05:16.125
Why bring up my mother?

05:16.208 --> 05:17.541
As soon as all this is finished,

05:17.625 --> 05:20.375
you, your mother, and your whole family
can go straight to hell, okay?

05:20.458 --> 05:22.375
- All right, Salvo.
- No! You need to promise me!

05:22.458 --> 05:23.833
I promise. Come on. Let's go.

05:23.916 --> 05:25.583
- All right.
- Let's go, Salvo. Let's go.

05:34.541 --> 05:35.666
All right. Okay.

05:41.083 --> 05:44.000
- And I'm not done with your mother.
- All right. The doorknob!

05:44.083 --> 05:45.541
Okay, fine. Okay.

06:10.666 --> 06:11.791
Oh, hi.

06:11.875 --> 06:13.833
I've never seen you before.

06:14.500 --> 06:15.750
Why are you cleaning?

06:15.833 --> 06:17.791
- Do you work here?
- Yes.

06:17.875 --> 06:18.833
You're a liar.

06:18.916 --> 06:21.333
No one's working today. There's a strike.

06:21.833 --> 06:24.500
And what's in that black bag there?

06:24.583 --> 06:25.666
It's all a game.

06:25.750 --> 06:28.250
I'm playing, uh, cops and robbers.

06:28.333 --> 06:30.458
And actually, I'm leaving right now,

06:30.541 --> 06:33.458
because if the cops catch me, then I lose.

06:34.333 --> 06:36.000
You can help me win, yeah?

06:36.083 --> 06:37.666
Don't tell anyone you saw me.

06:38.500 --> 06:40.708
Shh.

06:40.791 --> 06:42.333
Shh.

06:53.416 --> 06:56.666
Sorry, but how long has it been
since you've done maintenance here, huh?

06:57.250 --> 06:58.750
Is it really that bad?

06:58.833 --> 07:00.250
Yeah, of course.

07:00.333 --> 07:01.791
- See if that works now.
- Yeah.

07:13.291 --> 07:15.541
Come on. Don't run. Don't run. Don't run.

07:15.625 --> 07:16.666
Let's go.

07:17.958 --> 07:19.416
What took you so much time?

07:19.500 --> 07:21.541
- I'm here now.
- Stay calm.

07:21.625 --> 07:24.166
Now just stroll
like we have nothing to do with anything.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.958
Let's go. We can't leave any proof
that we were here this morning.

07:35.833 --> 07:37.291
- What's this then?
- Ugh.

07:39.750 --> 07:40.791
I didn't see it.

07:41.666 --> 07:43.541
We'll deal with this later.
Come on. Hurry up!

08:14.250 --> 08:16.625
<i>"Why does</i>
<i>your dog eat at your house</i>

08:16.708 --> 08:18.500
<i>and then do his business at mine?"</i>

08:18.583 --> 08:22.583
<i>These are the serious accusations</i>
<i>made by Mr. Bartolomeo</i> ,

08:22.666 --> 08:26.750
<i>who is now in police custody</i>
<i>after biting his neighbor's dog,</i>

08:26.833 --> 08:28.750
<i>a chihuahua named Fluffy,</i>

08:28.833 --> 08:32.250
<i>and the is the reason for the feud</i>
<i>between two childhood friends,</i>

08:32.333 --> 08:34.083
<i>now both 90 years old.</i>

08:34.166 --> 08:36.541
<i>Once again, Sicily's sweet sunlight</i>

08:36.625 --> 08:39.333
<i>exposes the bitterness of bad blood.</i>

08:40.000 --> 08:43.375
<i>That's all from police headquarters.</i>
<i>Time for celebrity news.</i>

08:43.458 --> 08:45.125
So they haven't found the body yet.

08:45.208 --> 08:47.375
Can you explain to me
what you were thinking,

08:47.458 --> 08:49.333
telling your mother
we were going to Castelmonte?

08:49.416 --> 08:51.708
When I was a kid,
I always used to go to Castelmonte.

08:51.791 --> 08:54.666
- Are you still a kid or something?
- No, I'm not a kid.

08:55.166 --> 08:59.541
My mom liked these pastries they would
make at a monastery there in Castelmonte.

08:59.625 --> 09:01.916
My mom liked them so much
that she used to make my dad

09:02.000 --> 09:04.375
go all the way to Castelmonte
just to buy them.

09:04.458 --> 09:05.333
Huh.

09:05.833 --> 09:09.000
Your mom sent your dad to Castelmonte
so she could cheat on him.

09:09.083 --> 09:11.625
Mom didn't cheat on my dad, all right?

09:11.708 --> 09:13.916
Yes, it runs in the family.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.458
You send people to Castelmonte
to cheat on them.

09:16.541 --> 09:18.083
All you've done is get better at it.

09:18.166 --> 09:20.541
You take me to Castelmonte,
your sister cheats on me,

09:20.625 --> 09:21.916
while your mother covers for her.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.083
You all just have
a thing with Castelmonte.

09:24.166 --> 09:27.666
I told you, we only used
to go to Castelmonte for those pastries.

09:27.750 --> 09:28.583
Eh.

09:30.791 --> 09:31.791
What did you say?

09:31.875 --> 09:34.291
We only used to go
to Castelmonte for the pastries.

09:35.333 --> 09:38.416
Finally, that's the first good idea
you've had all day today.

09:38.500 --> 09:39.916
- Huh?

09:40.000 --> 09:43.750
The two of us are gonna act like
the killer in <i>The Touch of the Killer.</i>

09:43.833 --> 09:45.000
All right, come on.

09:48.500 --> 09:50.166
How can you still not understand?

09:50.250 --> 09:52.958
We will go to Castelmonte
and buy some pastries.

09:53.041 --> 09:55.208
- Pastries?
- Yes, we'll get a receipt.

09:55.291 --> 09:58.250
Then we'll have proof
that we were, in fact, in Castelmonte,

09:58.333 --> 10:01.166
which means we could never have been
at the scene of the crime.

10:01.250 --> 10:02.750
Now, technically, it's called an alibi.

10:02.833 --> 10:05.833
And we need to have one in place
before the murder is discovered.

10:05.916 --> 10:07.125
We need to hurry.

10:07.208 --> 10:09.583
As long as they haven't found
the body, we're good.

10:14.708 --> 10:16.250
There's water everywhere.

10:16.750 --> 10:18.500
No one's answering.

10:19.000 --> 10:22.666
Mr. Gambino must've left
the water running. I'll tell the doorman.

10:23.541 --> 10:24.583
Okay.

10:32.791 --> 10:33.916
Mr. Gambino?

10:36.083 --> 10:37.333
Mr. Gambino?

10:41.500 --> 10:43.125
Why isn't he answering?

11:08.833 --> 11:09.958
It's here.

11:10.583 --> 11:11.916
- This is it?
- This is it.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.375
This is it. Should I knock?

11:14.458 --> 11:15.291
Yeah.

11:23.958 --> 11:24.875
Welcome.

11:24.958 --> 11:26.750
- How can I help you?
- Good afternoon.

11:26.833 --> 11:28.541
We're here to for the pastries.

11:28.625 --> 11:29.875
Oh, yes, of course.

11:29.958 --> 11:31.916
And we need a receipt.

11:32.000 --> 11:32.916
Eh?

11:34.583 --> 11:36.625
We've come here for the pastries.

11:36.708 --> 11:38.416
Of course, the pastries. Yes.

11:38.500 --> 11:39.833
Yes, and a receipt.

11:39.916 --> 11:41.083
Huh?

11:43.458 --> 11:44.458
Pastries?

11:44.541 --> 11:45.583
Pastries.

11:45.666 --> 11:47.083
- A receipt?
- Huh?

11:48.375 --> 11:52.125
Brothers, we sell our pastries
only to believers.

11:53.041 --> 11:54.208
Are you believers?

11:54.291 --> 11:55.750
Yes, absolutely.

11:55.833 --> 11:58.416
I actually make the sign of the cross
with just one hand.

11:58.500 --> 12:01.333
- I only need the one, you know?
- Wonderful.

12:01.416 --> 12:03.041
I have great news, then.

12:03.125 --> 12:06.125
You're just in time for afternoon prayers.

12:29.166 --> 12:31.791
Didn't you say it was time
for afternoon prayers?

12:31.875 --> 12:34.708
He who sings prays twice.

12:42.000 --> 12:42.833
Huh.

12:44.000 --> 12:44.875
Okay, stay cool.

12:44.958 --> 12:46.583
Just be cool.

12:46.666 --> 12:48.833
You have to pretend like nothing happened.

12:48.916 --> 12:50.916
- All right. All right.
- Say it with me, nothing!

12:51.000 --> 12:54.375
- Nothing. Nothing.
- Breathe. Calm. Calm.

12:56.458 --> 12:57.583
- What's up?
- Ah!

12:58.500 --> 12:59.583
Tortellini.

13:00.500 --> 13:02.500
- Everything all right?
- I'm fine.

13:04.833 --> 13:05.833
Where are you?

13:06.916 --> 13:08.291
Are you in town?

13:08.375 --> 13:10.416
I told you, I'm in Castelmonte.

13:11.791 --> 13:14.166
Oh, you're in Castelmonte.

13:15.583 --> 13:19.000
It's just that it's getting late,
and I was worried.

13:19.833 --> 13:20.875
<i>But</i>

13:22.125 --> 13:26.125
you do remember that tonight
you have your high school reunion, right?

13:26.208 --> 13:28.458
Once Mass is finished, we're coming home.

13:29.458 --> 13:30.333
You're at Mass?

13:30.416 --> 13:31.625
Yes, we're at Mass.

13:32.416 --> 13:34.208
<i>You're</i> at Mass?

13:34.291 --> 13:36.416
Yes, at Mass. What is the problem?

13:36.500 --> 13:39.791
It's good to go to Mass
and confess once in a while.

13:45.583 --> 13:47.416
My friends, please continue.

13:47.500 --> 13:50.083
One, two, three, four.

14:03.125 --> 14:04.333
Are these okay?

14:04.416 --> 14:06.250
- Yes, thank you.
- You're welcome.

14:06.333 --> 14:07.250
Forty euros.

14:08.583 --> 14:12.083
And remember, the Lord gives
only if He has received.

14:12.166 --> 14:13.958
About that. Since we've given,

14:14.041 --> 14:17.541
we'd like written confirmation
we've received these pastries.

14:18.333 --> 14:19.416
A receipt.

14:19.500 --> 14:20.458
Huh?

14:21.916 --> 14:25.791
Don't worry about your ears.
I'd worry about the IRS instead.

14:26.708 --> 14:27.875
Yeah.

14:27.958 --> 14:30.041
- Thank you for coming.
- Thank you.

14:30.125 --> 14:31.041
Goodbye.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.291
All right, remember.

14:57.375 --> 15:00.041
You said it yourself.
We're calm and serene.

15:00.125 --> 15:02.333
- All right.
- Like nothing ever happened.

15:02.416 --> 15:04.333
- All right. All right.
- Especially with Ester.

15:04.416 --> 15:06.208
Okay!

15:06.708 --> 15:09.083
I get it, okay?

15:14.958 --> 15:16.041
I need to stay calm.

15:16.541 --> 15:18.750
They at Alberto's place by coincidence.

15:21.375 --> 15:23.083
We're not dressed in our best.

15:23.166 --> 15:25.166
So you're thinking about Agata.

15:25.250 --> 15:27.958
- Who's thinking about Agata?
- You're always thinking about Agata.

15:28.041 --> 15:30.666
- How can you say that?
- I can see it in your eyes.

15:30.750 --> 15:33.250
Why do people keep saying that?
Tell me why.

15:36.416 --> 15:40.125
Put your hands together for
- Salvo and Valentino, the nerds from 5
- G!

15:42.083 --> 15:45.458
No. No, no, no, stop. Stop. Stop.
I wanna give a toast.

15:45.541 --> 15:47.750
To Salvo and Valentino.

15:47.833 --> 15:51.541
With their presence, they show us
the beauty of their friendship

15:51.625 --> 15:55.208
and also the bitterness of being tardy.

15:55.291 --> 15:57.000
We were hard at work!

15:57.083 --> 15:59.625
- Sergio, you're a true poet.

15:59.708 --> 16:02.250
Your talents are wasted as a journalist.

16:02.333 --> 16:03.833
Let's hear it for Sergio.

16:04.583 --> 16:06.916
- You deserve it.
- Welcome. Welcome

16:07.000 --> 16:08.833
- Welcome.
- Sorry, we were working.

16:08.916 --> 16:10.958
- Nothing we could do about it.
- Darling!

16:11.041 --> 16:12.875
I was starting to get worried.

16:12.958 --> 16:14.875
What took the two of you so damn long?

16:14.958 --> 16:17.708
Uh, we were so late,
we didn't stop to change.

16:17.791 --> 16:21.250
I have a confession to make.
We did go to Castelmonte.

16:21.333 --> 16:24.250
Not just to fix a television,
but also to bring you…

16:25.458 --> 16:26.791
- …these.

16:26.875 --> 16:28.958
Oh my, but these are… I…

16:29.500 --> 16:32.375
I haven't had these for a very long time.

16:32.458 --> 16:36.125
Your father, God bless him,
would be happy.

16:37.166 --> 16:40.583
Let's see if they're
as delicious as they used to be.

16:40.666 --> 16:45.291
Mama, you promised the doctor you
wouldn't eat any processed sugar, okay?

16:45.375 --> 16:47.958
Sounds like your family
has a problem keeping promises.

16:48.041 --> 16:49.416
My tortellini…

16:49.500 --> 16:50.958
Tortellini who?

16:51.041 --> 16:53.458
Who? Who's your tortellini?

16:53.958 --> 16:55.625
Why are you calling me tortellini?

16:55.708 --> 16:57.958
Tortellini?

16:58.041 --> 16:59.416
Eh. Eh.

16:59.500 --> 17:00.541
Tortellini!

17:02.166 --> 17:07.041
I have always said that you deserve more.
You do.

17:07.750 --> 17:10.666
Yeah, it's just been
a complicated day at work. That's all.

17:10.750 --> 17:12.750
Hello there. Mrs. Antonietta!

17:13.416 --> 17:14.416
Do you remember me?

17:14.500 --> 17:16.625
- You are?
- Cangelosi.

17:17.166 --> 17:19.166
Cangelosi! I failed you three times.

17:19.250 --> 17:20.166
You did!

17:20.250 --> 17:23.166
He's been cruel all day,
and I'd like to know why.

17:23.250 --> 17:25.458
Esther, why don't you
just stop imagining things?

17:25.541 --> 17:29.125
Valentino, I am your sister.
You have to tell me the truth.

17:29.208 --> 17:32.958
Why don't you tell me the truth?
You know, because I am your brother.

17:33.458 --> 17:35.458
Agata's not here yet,

17:35.541 --> 17:38.083
but she should be here any minute now.

17:40.583 --> 17:41.833
That was kind of weird.

17:41.916 --> 17:43.250
Hey, Sergio!

17:43.791 --> 17:45.000
Hey, Salvo.

17:46.416 --> 17:48.666
How's things? Two glasses of wine here.

17:50.708 --> 17:53.125
What? Did you dress
for your First Communion?

17:53.208 --> 17:56.416
Oh, stop. Please. You know
I always have to be ready for work.

17:56.500 --> 18:00.291
If I get a call from the newsroom,
I have to be camera-ready. Always. Yeah.

18:00.375 --> 18:01.625
Oh, about that.

18:02.125 --> 18:03.583
What's today's news?

18:03.666 --> 18:05.041
Any murders or anything?

18:05.125 --> 18:06.416
Today, no.

18:06.500 --> 18:09.375
- Oh.
- What can I say? The usual news.

18:10.208 --> 18:13.333
Nothing exciting.
It's really all nonsense, Salvo.

18:14.333 --> 18:17.041
- Sicilian journalism is dying.
- Dying?

18:17.125 --> 18:20.500
The truth, Sicily
isn't the place it used to be.

18:20.583 --> 18:21.708
Do you remember how it was?

18:22.291 --> 18:23.666
- Oh, yes.
- Blood feuds.

18:23.750 --> 18:25.375
Murderous revenge.

18:25.916 --> 18:28.500
And now, when was the last time
you heard of a war with the Mafia?

18:28.583 --> 18:30.000
- Yeah.

18:30.083 --> 18:32.166
- Don't worry about it, Sergio, huh.

18:32.250 --> 18:34.500
Better times are coming. At least for you.

18:34.583 --> 18:35.458
Let's hope so.

18:35.541 --> 18:37.500
- Cheers to you.
- Cheers to you.

18:39.875 --> 18:42.000
And here's Agata!

18:48.166 --> 18:50.041
Sorry I'm late.

18:50.125 --> 18:51.458
Agata!

18:51.541 --> 18:54.541
- Sergio!
- See? She is here at last.

18:54.625 --> 18:56.708
- Agata…
- See? She's here at last!

18:57.541 --> 19:00.291
Your return to our beloved land

19:00.375 --> 19:02.541
give us the sweetness of your smile

19:02.625 --> 19:06.291
and the bitterness
of your many bountiful goodbyes.

19:12.916 --> 19:14.166
Agata!

19:14.958 --> 19:16.041
Excuse me, guys.

19:16.625 --> 19:18.583
I didn't think you'd make it.

19:18.666 --> 19:19.916
Hi, Valentino.

19:20.875 --> 19:22.708
I know you've been away awhile.

19:22.791 --> 19:26.166
And she thought you were still licking
your wounds.

19:26.250 --> 19:28.166
Is that supposed to be funny? Huh?

19:29.041 --> 19:30.916
They're still going on
about the past.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.333
It's been a long time.
They should've moved on by now.

19:33.416 --> 19:35.291
They should find something else
to laugh about.

19:35.375 --> 19:38.041
Don't let them get to you.
They're just having fun.

19:38.625 --> 19:42.041
I'm not angry. I'm just going along
with the joke to make them laugh.

19:44.208 --> 19:47.041
- Should we grab a cocktail at the bar?
- Yes.

19:51.833 --> 19:53.375
What's wrong with your eyes?

19:55.375 --> 19:56.500
Conjunctivitis.

19:57.083 --> 19:57.916
Oh.

20:02.250 --> 20:03.583
Here we are.

20:12.916 --> 20:15.958
I haven't heard from you in years.
How did the school get in touch with you?

20:16.041 --> 20:17.708
Um, by chance, really.

20:17.791 --> 20:19.875
I called Simona
as soon as I got back to Sicily.

20:19.958 --> 20:23.166
She told me about the party,
and here I am.

20:23.250 --> 20:25.291
- What's been going on with you?

20:25.875 --> 20:27.333
What can I tell you?

20:27.416 --> 20:29.916
Nothing special ever happens in this town.

20:30.000 --> 20:33.083
It's really just boring, boring, boring.

20:34.166 --> 20:38.291
It's nothing you'd ever see
on a television show.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.166
So, are you married?

20:41.250 --> 20:42.250
No.

20:42.875 --> 20:43.833
Single.

20:43.916 --> 20:45.833
Are you still living with your mother?

20:45.916 --> 20:47.041
Of course not.

20:47.125 --> 20:49.458
I haven't lived with my mom in years.

20:49.958 --> 20:52.916
Uh! My mother. Who remembers her anyway?

20:55.208 --> 20:56.666
And you? Are you married?

20:57.333 --> 20:59.083
No, no, I'm done with men.

20:59.958 --> 21:01.666
I just think that men are…

21:02.166 --> 21:05.125
Well, no offense,
but you really are all the same,

21:05.208 --> 21:06.958
unreliable and childish.

21:08.291 --> 21:12.875
I have to add, you can also exhibit
cowardice when you are challenged.

21:12.958 --> 21:16.166
Yes. Yes, that's undeniable.

21:16.250 --> 21:18.958
So you agree. Perfect.

21:21.750 --> 21:26.000
Oh, I've never liked that Agata.
And look who showed up now.

21:26.708 --> 21:29.083
Your brother deserves so much better.

21:31.375 --> 21:34.083
Come on, Mom. You never like anyone.

21:35.041 --> 21:38.791
You haven't taught for years,
but it's like you're still grading people.

21:40.333 --> 21:43.291
Tell me. How did you get
that bruise on your forehead?

21:43.375 --> 21:44.333
I told you!

21:44.875 --> 21:48.375
I bumped my head while I was doing
some cleaning around the apartment.

21:48.458 --> 21:51.458
Well, guys, my job is not an easy one.

21:51.541 --> 21:53.625
Very few people in the world know…

21:55.708 --> 21:57.833
I didn't even have time
to get changed.

21:57.916 --> 21:59.666
Just look at the way I'm dressed.

21:59.750 --> 22:01.583
You look good.

22:01.666 --> 22:03.041
No one's in a tux here.

22:03.125 --> 22:04.791
Can I say hello too?

22:04.875 --> 22:06.625
- Ester!

22:07.208 --> 22:08.250
Mm.

22:09.541 --> 22:11.458
You look beautiful.

22:12.250 --> 22:14.041
Aside from the bruise.

22:14.125 --> 22:16.541
You look great.
Like no time has passed at all.

22:18.250 --> 22:20.208
And what about Salvo? How's he?

22:22.000 --> 22:24.750
He is good.
It looks like he's enjoying himself.

22:29.208 --> 22:32.541
You know, the other day I found
some photos from when we were in school,

22:32.625 --> 22:33.750
and you were in some.

22:33.833 --> 22:34.958
Really?

22:35.041 --> 22:36.666
You were the most beautiful girl
in school.

22:36.750 --> 22:38.625
You had a line of boys behind you.

22:38.708 --> 22:41.000
- Mm.
- And she chose the last one in the line.

22:41.083 --> 22:44.291
Mrs. Antonietta,
how nice to see you again.

22:44.375 --> 22:45.583
How nice for me.

22:45.666 --> 22:47.833
Huh. Have you gained weight?

22:52.041 --> 22:53.791
Well, you look lovely as always, ma'am.

22:53.875 --> 22:56.333
- Oh, thank you.
- Of course.

22:56.416 --> 22:58.166
What are you up to these days?

22:58.666 --> 22:59.916
- Self-care.
- Where's Salvo?

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
- Is that like a special diet?
- He was there.

23:02.083 --> 23:04.083
- No.
- Excuse me. I'll be right back.

23:04.166 --> 23:05.458
Just one second.

23:06.583 --> 23:07.833
I eat everything.

23:07.916 --> 23:11.208
- I cut sugar out. Now I'm eating it again.
- Hmm.

23:11.291 --> 23:13.916
Could I have a copy of those photos?

23:14.000 --> 23:16.041
It would be so cool
to have them, you know?

23:16.125 --> 23:19.416
There on the front line daily
reporting the real news.

23:19.500 --> 23:22.416
You know how many dead bodies I've seen?
Just take a guess.

23:22.500 --> 23:24.083
Sergio, have you seen Salvo?

23:24.166 --> 23:27.083
I saw him going upstairs.
He was pretty drunk, though.

23:27.166 --> 23:28.458
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

23:39.375 --> 23:42.083
Salvo? Salvo! What are you doing up there?

23:42.666 --> 23:44.083
Nothing yet.

23:44.166 --> 23:47.375
Salvo, I'm begging you.
Don't do anything stupid, Salvo.

23:48.166 --> 23:50.250
Oh, please,
don't do anything stupid, okay?

23:50.833 --> 23:54.083
She called him tortellone.

23:54.166 --> 23:57.083
I know,
but please don't do anything stupid.

23:58.541 --> 24:00.166
Oh, my love, Ester.

24:00.833 --> 24:03.041
What did I do to deserve this?

24:03.541 --> 24:07.208
Salvo, things are really bleak right now,
but with time, it will get better.

24:07.291 --> 24:09.083
Then you'll see things differently.

24:09.916 --> 24:12.583
- I'll jump and that'll be the end of it.
- No!

24:13.250 --> 24:14.833
You can't jump, Salvo.

24:15.583 --> 24:19.291
You have to finish telling me what happens
in <i>The Touch of the Killer, </i>Salvo.

24:19.375 --> 24:22.041
You can't leave me like this
after eight whole seasons.

24:22.583 --> 24:25.666
You can finish the show,
and then I'll come to you in a dream,

24:25.750 --> 24:27.875
and you can tell me
all the details of the end.

24:27.958 --> 24:29.333
- No.

24:29.416 --> 24:33.041
I can't watch it on my own.
It wouldn't be right, Salvo.

24:35.125 --> 24:36.916
Would you really do that for me?

24:37.000 --> 24:38.083
Of course, Salvo.

24:38.166 --> 24:39.958
We've always done everything together

24:40.041 --> 24:42.666
ever since way back
when we were little kids in school.

24:42.750 --> 24:46.083
If you jump now, it'll be the first thing
you've ever done on your own.

24:46.166 --> 24:47.250
You're right.

24:48.541 --> 24:50.125
Okay, let's jump together,

24:50.208 --> 24:51.916
holding each other close.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.208
No, Salvo. Wait.

24:53.291 --> 24:54.500
Just wait a second, Salvo.

24:54.583 --> 24:56.916
- Don't move. I'm right here, okay, Salvo?
- I'm here too.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
Don't move.
I'm coming over to you, my friend.

24:59.083 --> 25:01.500
- I'm coming. Don't move.
- Welcome to here.

25:02.791 --> 25:04.041
That's a long way down.

25:04.125 --> 25:06.458
- Come here, my friend.
- I'm dying.

25:06.541 --> 25:08.666
Come on. Don't ever say that, okay?

25:08.750 --> 25:10.583
You aren't allowed to say that to me.

25:13.875 --> 25:16.500
Did you know
your lips are just like your sister's?

25:16.583 --> 25:17.416
So what?

25:17.500 --> 25:18.500
Give me one kiss.

25:18.583 --> 25:20.250
- Stop it!
- Just one kiss, please.

25:20.333 --> 25:23.333
Stop it! You're drunk, okay?
Put that bottle down right now.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.666
Let's get rid of the DNA, just in case.

25:31.750 --> 25:34.666
Good. I want you clearheaded
and thinking like your killer.

25:34.750 --> 25:37.583
Come here. Don't worry about it anymore.

25:48.208 --> 25:49.625
Let's hope it's a drug raid!

26:14.791 --> 26:16.666
A round of applause for the police!

26:27.875 --> 26:31.166
Ah, we already made it
to the eighth season.

26:32.125 --> 26:33.291
Hmm.
