00:14.431 --> 00:19.028
There was a time not long ago,
before dogs.

00:19.186 --> 00:21.029
They didn't exist.

00:21.188 --> 00:25.694
Now there are big ones, small ones,
smugglers, guardians, hunters.

00:25.859 --> 00:28.783
Every kind of dog you could possibly want.

00:28.946 --> 00:30.914
How did that happen?

00:31.073 --> 00:32.244
It's not just dogs.

00:32.406 --> 00:35.786
Where did all the different kinds
of living creatures come from?

00:36.328 --> 00:40.299
The answer is a transforming power
that sounds like something...

00:40.457 --> 00:45.304
...straight out of a fairy tale or myth,
but it's no such thing.

02:17.387 --> 02:22.109
Let's go back across 30,000 years
to a time before dogs...

02:22.851 --> 02:26.526
...when our ancestors lived
in the endless winter of the last ice age.

02:27.397 --> 02:31.072
Our ancestors were wanderers
living in small bands.

02:31.234 --> 02:33.578
They slept beneath the stars.

02:33.737 --> 02:39.665
The sky was their storybook, calendar,
an instruction manual for living.

02:39.826 --> 02:42.204
It told them when the bitter colds
would come...

02:42.371 --> 02:44.499
...when the wild grains would ripen...

02:44.665 --> 02:47.919
...when the herds of caribou and bison
would be on the move.

02:48.085 --> 02:51.931
Their idea of home was Earth itself.

02:52.506 --> 02:55.726
But they lived in fear
of other hungry creatures.

02:55.884 --> 02:59.934
The mountain lions and the bears
that competed with them for the same prey.

03:00.097 --> 03:03.226
And the wolves that threatened
to carry off and devour...

03:03.392 --> 03:05.440
...the most vulnerable among them.

03:23.662 --> 03:25.585
All the wolves want to get at the bone...

03:25.747 --> 03:28.170
...but most are too frightened
to come close enough.

03:28.959 --> 03:33.180
Their fear is due to high levels
of stress hormones in their blood.

03:33.338 --> 03:34.760
It's a matter of survival.

03:34.923 --> 03:37.972
Because coming too close to humans
can be fatal.

03:38.135 --> 03:40.479
But a few wolves, due to
natural variations...

03:40.637 --> 03:42.856
...have lower levels of those hormones.

03:43.014 --> 03:46.188
This makes them less afraid of humans.

03:49.730 --> 03:52.984
This wolf has discovered what a branch
of his ancestors figured out...

03:53.150 --> 03:57.701
...some 15,000 years ago.
An excellent survival strategy.

03:57.863 --> 04:01.037
Domestication, humans.

04:01.199 --> 04:04.578
Let the humans do the hunting,
don't threaten them...

04:04.745 --> 04:06.998
...and they'll let you
scavenge their garbage.

04:07.164 --> 04:09.792
You'll eat more regularly,
you'll leave more offspring...

04:09.958 --> 04:13.508
...and those offspring
will inherit your disposition.

04:13.962 --> 04:18.137
This selection for tameness would be
reinforced with each generation...

04:18.300 --> 04:20.553
...until that line of wild wolves...

04:20.719 --> 04:25.691
...evolves into dogs.

04:25.849 --> 04:28.102
You might call this
"survival of the friendliest."

Then as now, this was a good
deal for the humans too.

04:36.193 --> 04:39.037
The scavenging dogs
weren't just a sanitation squad.

04:39.196 --> 04:40.914

As this interspecies partnership
continued over time...

05:00.425 --> 05:02.974
...the dogs' appearance changed also.

05:03.136 --> 05:05.559
Cuteness became a selective advantage.

05:05.722 --> 05:08.271
The more adorable you were,
the better chance you had...

05:08.433 --> 05:11.687

to another generation.

05:11.853 --> 05:14.151
What began as an alliance
of convenience...

05:14.314 --> 05:18.035

that deepened over time.

to choose a mate.</i>

06:01.194 --> 06:03.743

06:32.517 --> 06:35.987
<i>This kind of evolution is called
artificial selection...</i>

<i>...or breeding.</i>

06:37.397 --> 06:39.866
<i>Turning wolves into dogs
was the first time...</i>

06:40.025 --> 06:42.995
<i>...we humans took evolution
into our own hands.</i>

06:43.153 --> 06:44.951
<i>And we've been doing it ever since...</i>

06:45.113 --> 06:48.993
<i>...to shape all the plants and animals
that we depend on.</i>

06:49.159 --> 06:53.460
<i>In a blink of cosmic time,
just 15- or 20,000 years...</i>

06:53.622 --> 06:58.344
<i>...we turned gray wolves into
all the kinds of dogs we love today.</i>

<i>Think of it.
Every breed of dog you've ever seen...</i>

07:02.213 --> 07:04.557

<font color="#D900D9">(GROWLING)</font>

07:37.791 --> 07:41.045
Artificial selection
turned the wolf into the shepherd...

07:41.211 --> 07:43.885
...and the wild grasses
into wheat and corn.

07:44.047 --> 07:47.597
In fact, almost every plant
and animal that we eat today...

07:47.759 --> 07:51.480
...was bred from a wild,
less-edible ancestor.

07:51.638 --> 07:54.892
If artificial selection can work
such profound changes...

07:55.058 --> 07:59.985

what can natural selection do...

08:00.146 --> 08:02.649

The answer is all the beauty
and diversity of life.

08:08.571 --> 08:10.244
How does it work?

08:10.407 --> 08:15.789
<i>Our ship of the imagination
can take us anywhere in space and time...</i>

08:34.097 --> 08:35.144
<i>May not seem like it...</i>

08:35.306 --> 08:39.152
...but we've been living in an ice age
for the last two million years.

08:39.309 --> 08:41.938
This just happens to be
one of the long intermissions.

08:42.105 --> 08:46.110
For most of those two million years,
the climate has been cold and dry.

08:46.276 --> 08:48.745
The North Polar ice cap
extended much farther south...

08:48.903 --> 08:51.031
...than it does today.

08:51.197 --> 08:53.620
In one of those long,
cold glacial periods...

08:53.783 --> 08:56.457
...when the winter sea ice
stretched from the North Pole...

08:56.619 --> 08:59.418
...all the way down
to what is now Los Angeles...

09:00.373 --> 09:04.469
<i>...great bears roamed

09:13.094 --> 09:15.813
<i>...but something extraordinary
is happening inside her.</i>

09:16.556 --> 09:19.935
Something that will give rise
to a new species.

09:20.101 --> 09:24.982
In order to see it, we'll need to
descend down to a much smaller scale...

09:25.148 --> 09:26.821
...to the cellular level...

09:26.983 --> 09:30.613

10:15.615 --> 10:18.585

strutting along those girders?</i>

10:33.049 --> 10:35.598
<i>They are proteins called kinesin.</i>

10:35.760 --> 10:38.388
<i>These kinesin
are part of the transport crew...</i>

10:38.555 --> 10:41.229
<i>...that's busy moving
cargo around the cell.</i>

10:41.391 --> 10:43.234
<i>How alien they seem.</i>

10:43.393 --> 10:46.522
<i>And yet these tiny creatures,
and beings like them...</i>

10:46.688 --> 10:52.366
<i>...are a part of every living cell,
including the ones inside you.</i>

10:53.361 --> 10:56.080
If life has a sanctuary...

10:56.239 --> 11:00.585
...it's here in the nucleus
which contains our DNA.

11:01.286 --> 11:03.914
The ancient scripture of our genetic code.

11:04.080 --> 11:09.587
And it's written in a language
that all life can read.

11:14.924 --> 11:18.849
<i>DNA is a molecule
shaped like a long twisted ladder...</i>

11:19.012 --> 11:21.060
<i>...or double helix.</i>

11:21.222 --> 11:25.443
The rungs of the ladder are made of
four different kinds of smaller molecules.

11:25.602 --> 11:28.526
These are the letters
of the genetic alphabet.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.656
Particular arrangements
of those letters...

11:30.815 --> 11:33.534
...spell out the instructions
for all living things...

11:33.693 --> 11:36.788
...telling them how to
grow, move, digest...

11:36.946 --> 11:40.541
...sense the environment, heal,
and reproduce.

11:40.700 --> 11:43.544
The DNA double helix
is a molecular machine...

11:43.703 --> 11:48.174
...with about 100 billion
parts called atoms.

11:48.333 --> 11:51.963
There are as many atoms
in a single molecule of your DNA...

11:52.128 --> 11:55.098
<i>...as there are stars in a typical galaxy.</i>

11:55.256 --> 12:00.057
<i>The same is true for dogs and bears...</i>

12:00.220 --> 12:02.598
<i>...and every living thing.</i>

12:03.306 --> 12:08.654
<i>We are, each of us, a little universe.</i>

12:16.319 --> 12:19.163
<i>The DNA message handed down
from cell to cell...</i>

12:19.322 --> 12:21.745
<i>...and from generation to generation
is copied...</i>

12:21.908 --> 12:22.955
<i>...with extreme care.</i>

12:23.117 --> 12:27.497
The birth of a new DNA molecule
begins when an unwinding protein...

12:27.664 --> 12:30.042
...separates the two strands
of the double helix...

12:30.208 --> 12:32.176
...breaking the rungs apart.

12:32.335 --> 12:34.463
Inside the liquid of the nucleus...

12:34.629 --> 12:38.179
...the molecular letters of
the genetic code float freely.

12:38.341 --> 12:41.845
Each strand of the helix
copies its lost partner...

12:42.011 --> 12:44.935
...resulting in two
identical DNA molecules.

12:45.098 --> 12:47.817
<i>That's how life reproduces
genes and transmits them...</i>

12:47.976 --> 12:50.195
<i>...from one generation to the next.</i>

12:50.353 --> 12:52.606
<i>When a living cell divides in two...</i>

12:52.772 --> 12:57.118
<i>...each one takes away with it
a complete copy of the DNA.</i>

12:57.277 --> 13:00.030
<i>A specialized protein
proofreads to make sure...</i>

13:00.196 --> 13:05.418
<i>...that only the right letters are accepted
so that the DNA is accurately copied.</i>

13:05.576 --> 13:07.249
<i>But nobody's perfect.</i>

13:07.412 --> 13:10.461
<i>Occasionally,
a proofreading error slips through...</i>

13:10.623 --> 13:14.253
<i>...making a small, random change
in the genetic instructions.</i>

13:14.419 --> 13:17.889
<i>A mutation has occurred
in the bear's egg cell.</i>

13:18.047 --> 13:21.426
<i>A random event as tiny as this one
can have consequences...</i>

13:21.592 --> 13:24.562
<i>...on a far grander scale.</i>

13:26.055 --> 13:29.901
<i>That mutation altered the gene
that controls fur color.</i>

13:30.059 --> 13:33.233
<i>It will affect the production
of dark pigment in the fur...</i>

13:33.396 --> 13:35.444
<i>...of the bear's offspring.</i>

13:35.606 --> 13:37.734
<i>Most mutations are harmless.</i>

13:37.900 --> 13:39.447
<i>Some are deadly.</i>

13:39.610 --> 13:42.329
<i>But a few, purely by chance,
can give an organism...</i>

13:42.488 --> 13:46.083
<i>...a critical advantage
over the competition.</i>

13:46.242 --> 13:49.416
<i>A year has passed.
Our bear is now a mother.</i>

13:49.579 --> 13:51.832
<i>And as a result of that mutation...</i>

13:51.998 --> 13:55.252
<i>...one of her two cubs
was born with a white coat.</i>

13:55.418 --> 13:59.013
<i>When the cubs get old enough
to venture out on their own...</i>

13:59.172 --> 14:00.845
<i>...which bear is more likely...</i>

14:01.007 --> 14:04.432
<i>...to be able to sneak up
on unsuspecting prey?</i>

14:04.594 --> 14:07.894
<i>The brown bear can be seen
against the snow a mile away.</i>

14:08.056 --> 14:10.730
<i>The white bear prospers and passes on...</i>

14:10.892 --> 14:13.611
<i>...its own particular set of genes.</i>

14:13.770 --> 14:16.193
<i>This happens repeatedly.</i>

14:16.356 --> 14:17.983
<i>Over succeeding generations...</i>

14:18.149 --> 14:23.451
<i>...the gene for white fur spreads through
the entire population of Arctic bears.</i>

14:23.613 --> 14:28.961
<i>The gene for dark fur
loses out in the competition for survival.</i>

14:30.620 --> 14:34.750
Mutations are entirely random
and happen all the time.

14:34.916 --> 14:36.634
But the environment rewards those...

14:36.793 --> 14:38.966
...that increase the chance for survival.

14:39.128 --> 14:43.804
It naturally selects the living things
that are better suited to survive.

14:43.966 --> 14:46.640
And that selection
is the opposite of random.

14:50.139 --> 14:54.189
<i>The two populations of bears
separated and over thousands of years...</i>

14:54.352 --> 14:57.777
<i>...evolved other characteristics
that set them apart.</i>

14:57.939 --> 15:01.364
<i>They became different species.</i>

15:02.693 --> 15:07.665
<i>That's what Charles Darwin meant
by "the origin of species."</i>

15:08.449 --> 15:10.827
<i>An individual bear doesn't evolve.</i>

15:10.993 --> 15:15.840
<i>The population of bears evolves
over generations.</i>

15:16.666 --> 15:18.714
If the Arctic ice continues to dwindle...

15:18.876 --> 15:22.631
...due to global warming,
the polar bears may go extinct.

15:22.797 --> 15:24.720
They'll be replaced by brown bears...

15:24.882 --> 15:27.556
...better adapted
to the now defrosted environment.

15:29.178 --> 15:31.977
This is a different story
from the one about the dogs.

15:32.140 --> 15:34.643
No breeder guided these changes.

15:34.809 --> 15:38.063
Instead, the environment
itself selects them.

15:38.229 --> 15:40.857
This is evolution by natural selection...

15:41.023 --> 15:44.618
...the most revolutionary concept
in the history of science.

15:44.777 --> 15:48.873
Darwin first presented the evidence
for this idea in 1859.

15:49.031 --> 15:52.706
The uproar it caused has never subsided.

15:52.869 --> 15:54.997
Why?

16:02.712 --> 16:04.589
<font color="#D900D9">(BIRDS CHIRPING)</font>

16:04.755 --> 16:06.849
We all understand
the twinge of discomfort...

16:07.008 --> 16:09.932
...at the thought that we share
a common ancestor with the apes.

16:10.845 --> 16:13.473
<i>No one can embarrass you like a relative.</i>

16:13.639 --> 16:15.562
<i>Our closest ones, the chimpanzees...</i>

16:15.725 --> 16:18.604
<i>...they frequently behave inappropriately
in public.</i>

16:18.769 --> 16:22.694
<i>There's an understandable human need
to distance ourselves from them.</i>

16:22.857 --> 16:25.406
A central premise of traditional belief...

16:25.568 --> 16:29.198
...is that we were created separately
from all the other animals.

16:29.363 --> 16:34.585
It's easy to see why this idea has
taken hold. It makes us feel special.

16:35.077 --> 16:41.130
But what about our kinship with the trees?
How does that make you feel?

16:49.592 --> 16:54.644
<i>Okay, here's a segment of the oak
tree's DNA. Think of it like a barcode.</i>

16:54.805 --> 17:00.107
<i>The instructions written in the code of
life tell the tree how to metabolize sugar.</i>

17:00.269 --> 17:03.148
<i>Now let's compare it with
the same section of my own DNA.</i>

17:08.986 --> 17:10.282
<i>The DNA doesn't lie.</i>

17:10.445 --> 17:14.246
This tree and me, we're long-lost cousins.

17:14.407 --> 17:15.910
And it's not just the trees.

17:16.077 --> 17:18.829
If you go back far enough,
you'll find that we share...

17:18.996 --> 17:21.965
...a common ancestor with the butterfly...

17:22.124 --> 17:26.546
"Gray Wolf... ...mushroom...
...shark...

17:26.712 --> 17:29.473
...bacterium... ...sparrow.

17:29.632 --> 17:31.009
What a family.

17:31.175 --> 17:34.395
Other parts of the barcode vary
from species to species.

17:34.554 --> 17:38.149
That's what makes the difference
between an owl and an octopus.

17:38.307 --> 17:40.355
Unless you have an identical twin...

17:40.518 --> 17:45.024
...there's no one else in the universe
with the exact same DNA as you.

17:45.189 --> 17:47.408
Within other species,
the genetic differences...

17:47.567 --> 17:50.741
...provide the raw material
for natural selection.

17:50.903 --> 17:54.999
The environment selects which genes survive
and multiply.

17:55.157 --> 17:58.661
When it comes to the genetic instructions
for life's most basic functions...

17:58.828 --> 18:03.504
...say, digesting sugars, we and
other species are almost identical.

18:03.666 --> 18:06.966
<i>That's because those functions
are so basic to life...</i>

18:07.128 --> 18:11.053
<i>...they evolved before the various
life-forms branched off from each other.</i>

18:11.215 --> 18:14.014
<i>This is our tree of life.</i>

18:14.176 --> 18:17.726
<i>Science has made it possible
for us to construct this family tree...</i>

18:17.888 --> 18:20.232
<i>...for all the species of life on Earth.</i>

18:20.391 --> 18:23.520
<i>Close genetic relatives occupy
the same branch of the tree...</i>

18:23.686 --> 18:27.065
<i>...while more distant cousins
are farther away.</i>

18:27.231 --> 18:30.360
<i>Each twig is a living species.</i>

18:31.611 --> 18:34.785
<i>And the trunk of the tree
represents the common ancestors...</i>

18:34.947 --> 18:37.666
<i>...of all life on Earth.</i>

18:37.825 --> 18:40.044
<i>The stuff of life is so malleable...</i>

18:40.202 --> 18:42.921
<i>...that once it got started,
the environment molded it...</i>

18:43.080 --> 18:46.129
<i>...into a staggering variety of forms...</i>

18:46.292 --> 18:50.968
<i>...10,000 times more than
we can possibly show here.</i>

18:52.965 --> 18:54.387
<i>Biologists have cataloged...</i>

18:54.550 --> 18:57.645
<i>...a half a million different
kinds of beetles alone.</i>

19:01.182 --> 19:04.652
<i>Not to mention the numberless varieties
of bacteria.</i>

19:05.186 --> 19:07.564
<i>There are many millions
of living species...</i>

19:07.730 --> 19:11.325
<i>...of animals and plants,
most of them still unknown to science.</i>

19:11.484 --> 19:14.533
<i>Think of that.
We have yet to make contact...</i>

19:14.695 --> 19:18.245
<i>...with most of the forms
of terrestrial life.</i>

19:18.407 --> 19:23.379
<i>That's how many kinds of life there are
on this tiny planet alone.</i>

19:24.288 --> 19:27.041
<i>The tree of life extends
its feelers in all directions...</i>

19:27.208 --> 19:30.257
<i>...finding and exploiting what works,
creating new environments...</i>

19:30.419 --> 19:33.093
<i>...and opportunities for new forms.</i>

19:36.300 --> 19:39.725
<i>The tree of life is three
and a half billion years old.</i>

19:39.887 --> 19:44.893
<i>That's plenty of time to develop
an impressive repertoire of tricks.</i>

19:48.187 --> 19:52.112
<i>Evolution can disguise an animal
as a plant...</i>

19:57.697 --> 20:01.543
<i>...taking thousands of generations
to contrive an elaborate costume...</i>

20:01.701 --> 20:06.582
<i>...that fools predators into looking
elsewhere for someone to eat.</i>

20:06.747 --> 20:10.468
<i>Or it can disguise a plant as an animal...</i>

20:10.626 --> 20:13.630
<i>...evolving blossoms that take on
the appearance of a wasp...</i>

20:13.796 --> 20:17.642
<i>...the orchid's way of fooling
real wasps into pollinating it.</i>

20:19.677 --> 20:24.934
<i>This is the awesome shape-shifting power
of natural selection.</i>

20:31.147 --> 20:35.653
<i>Among the dense, tangled limbs
of the vast tree of life...</i>

20:35.818 --> 20:37.866
<i>...you are here.</i>

20:38.028 --> 20:42.078
<i>One tiny branch among countless millions.</i>

20:42.241 --> 20:47.998
<i>Science reveals that all
life on Earth is one.</i>

20:50.291 --> 20:53.761
Darwin discovered the actual mechanism
of evolution.

20:53.919 --> 20:56.513
The prevailing belief
was that the complexity...

20:56.672 --> 21:00.518
...and variety of life must be the work
of an intelligent designer...

21:00.676 --> 21:04.726
...who created each of these millions
of different species separately.

21:04.889 --> 21:08.359
Living things are just
too intricate, it was said...

21:08.517 --> 21:12.067
...to be the result of unguided evolution.

21:12.229 --> 21:17.611
Consider the human eye,
a masterpiece of complexity.

21:20.529 --> 21:26.127
<i>It requires a cornea, iris, lens, retina...</i>

21:26.285 --> 21:28.413
<i>...optic nerves, muscles...</i>

21:28.579 --> 21:33.585
<i>...let alone the brain's elaborate
neural network to interpret images.</i>

21:34.126 --> 21:39.599
<i>It's more complicated than any device
ever crafted by human intelligence.</i>

21:39.757 --> 21:43.853
<i>Therefore, it was argued,
the human eye can't be the result...</i>

21:44.011 --> 21:46.389
<i>...of mindless evolution.</i>

21:46.555 --> 21:50.230
<i>To know if that's true,
we need to travel across time...</i>

21:50.392 --> 21:54.863
<i>...to a world before
there were eyes to see.</i>

22:14.416 --> 22:17.295
<i>In the beginning, life was blind.</i>

22:19.755 --> 22:23.510
<i>This is what our world looked like
four billion years ago...</i>

22:23.676 --> 22:26.555
<i>...before there were any eyes to see.</i>

22:26.720 --> 22:31.601
<i>Until a few hundred million years passed,
and then, one day...</i>

22:31.767 --> 22:35.692
<i>...there was a microscopic copying error
in the DNA of a bacterium.</i>

22:35.855 --> 22:41.112
<i>This random mutation gave that microbe
a protein molecule that absorbed sunlight.</i>

22:41.277 --> 22:44.907
<i>Want to know what the world looked like
to a light-sensitive bacterium?</i>

22:45.072 --> 22:48.372
<i>Take a look at the right
side of the screen.</i>

22:49.368 --> 22:51.462
<i>Mutations continued to occur at random...</i>

22:51.620 --> 22:55.716
<i>...as they always do in any population
of living things.</i>

22:57.418 --> 23:02.640
<i>Another mutation caused a dark bacterium
to flee intense light.</i>

23:03.299 --> 23:05.301
<i>What is going on here?</i>

23:05.467 --> 23:06.844
<i>Night and day.</i>

23:07.011 --> 23:09.639
<i>Those bacteria that could
tell light from dark...</i>

23:09.805 --> 23:12.479
<i>...had a decisive advantage
over the ones that couldn't.</i>

23:12.641 --> 23:16.441
<i>Why? Because the daytime brought
harsh, ultraviolet light...</i>

23:16.604 --> 23:18.698
<i>...that damages DNA.</i>

23:19.273 --> 23:22.026
<i>The sensitive bacteria
fled the intense light...</i>

23:22.192 --> 23:24.866
<i>...to safely exchange
their DNA in the dark.</i>

23:25.029 --> 23:26.656
<i>They survived in greater numbers...</i>

23:26.822 --> 23:29.245
<i>...than the bacteria
that stayed at the surface.</i>

23:30.117 --> 23:34.588
<i>Over time, those light-sensitive proteins
became concentrated in a pigment spot...</i>

23:34.747 --> 23:37.876
<i>...on the more advanced,
one-celled organism.</i>

23:38.334 --> 23:41.554
<i>This made it possible to find the light...</i>

23:41.712 --> 23:43.180
...an overwhelming advantage...

23:43.339 --> 23:46.969
<i>...for an organism
that harvests sunlight to make food.</i>

23:53.724 --> 23:57.319
<i>Here's a ï¬‚atworms-eye view of the world.</i>

23:57.478 --> 24:01.949
<i>This multi-celled organism
evolved a dimple in the pigment spot.</i>

24:02.107 --> 24:03.609
<i>The bowl-shaped depression...</i>

24:03.776 --> 24:07.451
<i>...allowed the animal to distinguish
light from shadow...</i>

24:07.613 --> 24:10.412
<i>...to crudely make out objects
in its vicinity...</i>

24:10.574 --> 24:14.750
<i>...including those to eat
and those that might eat it...</i>

24:14.912 --> 24:17.131
<i>...a tremendous advantage.</i>

24:17.790 --> 24:21.465
<i>Later, things became a little clearer.
The dimple deepened...</i>

24:21.627 --> 24:24.801
<i>...and evolved into a socket
with a small opening.</i>

24:24.964 --> 24:26.637
<i>Over thousands of generations...</i>

24:26.799 --> 24:30.849
<i>...natural selection
was slowly sculpting the eye.</i>

24:32.054 --> 24:37.231
<i>The opening contracted to a pinhole covered
by a protective transparent membrane.</i>

24:37.393 --> 24:39.680
<i>Only a little light could
enter the tiny hole</i>

24:39.692 --> 24:41.990
<i>but it was enough to
paint a dim image...</i>

24:42.147 --> 24:46.744
<i>...on the sensitive inner surface of
the eye. This sharpened the focus.</i>

24:46.902 --> 24:49.121
<i>A larger opening
would have let in more light...</i>

24:49.279 --> 24:52.874
<i>...to make a brighter image
but one that was out of focus.</i>

24:53.033 --> 24:57.880
<i>This development launched
the visual equivalent of an arms race.</i>

25:09.425 --> 25:13.180
<i>The competition needed to keep up
to survive.</i>

25:13.345 --> 25:17.270
<i>But then a splendid new feature
of the eye evolved...</i>

25:17.433 --> 25:22.610
<i>...a lens that provided both brightness
and sharp focus.</i>

25:23.272 --> 25:24.774
<i>In the eyes of primitive fish...</i>

25:24.940 --> 25:28.615
<i>...the transparent gel
near the pinhole formed into a lens.</i>

25:28.777 --> 25:32.782
<i>At the same time, the pinhole enlarged
to let in more and more light.</i>

25:32.948 --> 25:35.827
<i>Fish could now see in high-def...</i>

25:35.993 --> 25:39.839
<i>...both close up and far away.</i>

25:39.997 --> 25:42.591
<i>And then something terrible happened.</i>

25:43.751 --> 25:46.379
<i>Have you ever noticed
that a straw in a glass of water...</i>

25:46.545 --> 25:48.513
<i>...looks bent at the surface of the water?</i>

25:48.672 --> 25:51.346
<i>That's because light bends
when it goes from one medium...</i>

25:51.508 --> 25:54.261
<i>...to another, say from water to air.</i>

25:54.428 --> 25:58.478
<i>Our eyes originally evolved
to see in water.</i>

25:58.640 --> 26:00.938
<i>The watery fluid in those eyes...</i>

26:01.101 --> 26:03.820
<i>...neatly eliminated the distortion
of that bending effect.</i>

26:06.482 --> 26:10.658
<i>But for land animals,
the light carries images from dry air...</i>

26:10.819 --> 26:13.743
<i>...into their still-watery eyes.</i>

26:13.906 --> 26:18.503
<i>That bends the light rays
causing all kinds of distortions.</i>

26:19.161 --> 26:22.131
When our amphibious ancestors
left the water for the land...

26:22.289 --> 26:25.293
...their eyes,
exquisitely evolved to see in water...

26:25.459 --> 26:27.553
...were lousy for seeing in the air.

26:27.711 --> 26:30.385
Our vision has never been as good since.

26:30.547 --> 26:33.266
We like to think of our eyes
as state-of-the-art...

26:33.425 --> 26:35.723
...but 375 million years later...

26:35.886 --> 26:38.605
...we still can't see things
right in front of our noses...

26:38.764 --> 26:42.985
...or discern fine details in near darkness
the way fish can.

26:43.143 --> 26:46.522
When we left the water,
why didn't nature just start over again...

26:46.688 --> 26:50.864
...and evolve us a new set of eyes
that were optimal for seeing in the air?

26:51.026 --> 26:52.778
Nature doesn't work that way.

26:52.945 --> 26:56.199
Evolution reshapes existing structures
over generations...

26:56.365 --> 26:58.413
...adapting them with small changes.

26:58.575 --> 27:02.751
It can't just go back to the drawing board
and start from scratch.

27:02.913 --> 27:06.087
<i>At every stage of its development,
the evolving eye...</i>

27:06.250 --> 27:10.175
<i>...functioned well enough to provide
a selective advantage for survival.</i>

27:10.337 --> 27:13.716
<i>And among animals alive today,
we find eyes...</i>

27:13.882 --> 27:16.260
<i>...at all these stages of development.</i>

27:19.680 --> 27:21.682
<i>And all of them function.</i>

27:23.475 --> 27:25.398
<i>The complexity of the human eye...</i>

27:25.561 --> 27:28.110
<i>...poses no challenge to evolution
by natural selection.</i>

27:28.272 --> 27:33.745
<i>In fact, the eye and all of biology
makes no sense without evolution.</i>

27:33.902 --> 27:39.204
<i>Some claim that evolution is just a theory
as if it were merely an opinion.</i>

27:39.366 --> 27:42.245
The theory of evolution,
like the theory of gravity...

27:42.411 --> 27:44.413
...is a scientific fact.

27:44.580 --> 27:47.003
Evolution really happened.

27:47.166 --> 27:51.717
Accepting our kinship with all life
on Earth is not only solid science.

27:51.879 --> 27:56.476
In my view,
it's also a soaring spiritual experience.

28:04.057 --> 28:06.059
<i>Because evolution is blind...</i>

28:06.226 --> 28:10.356
<i>...it cannot anticipate or adapt
to catastrophic events.</i>

28:11.440 --> 28:13.909
<i>The tree of life
has some broken branches.</i>

28:14.067 --> 28:17.867
<i>Many of them were severed
in the five greatest catastrophes...</i>

28:18.030 --> 28:20.283
<i>...that life has ever known.</i>

28:20.449 --> 28:22.292
<i>Somewhere, there's a memorial...</i>

28:22.451 --> 28:27.298
<i>...to the multitude of lost species,
the Hails of Extinction.</i>

28:27.456 --> 28:29.129
<i>Come with me.</i>

28:43.639 --> 28:46.483
Welcome to the Halls of Extinction.

28:47.643 --> 28:52.399
A monument to the broken branches
on the tree of life.

29:02.616 --> 29:06.541
For every single one
of the millions of species alive today...

29:06.703 --> 29:09.832
...perhaps a thousand others have perished.

29:09.998 --> 29:13.844
Most of them died out in everyday
competition with other life-forms.

29:14.002 --> 29:17.472
But many of them were swept away
in vast cataclysms...

29:17.631 --> 29:19.383
...that overwhelmed the planet.

29:20.092 --> 29:24.518
In the last 500 million years,
this has happened five times.

29:26.431 --> 29:30.436
Five extinctions devastated life on Earth.

29:31.144 --> 29:35.524
The worst happened
250 million years ago...

29:35.691 --> 29:40.367
...at the end of an era
known as the Permian.

29:57.004 --> 29:59.098
Trilobites were
armored animals that hunted...

29:59.256 --> 30:02.135
...in great herds across the seafloor.

30:02.301 --> 30:06.556
They were among the first animals to evolve
image-forming eyes.

30:09.433 --> 30:13.654
Trilobites had a good long run,
some 270 million years.

30:13.812 --> 30:17.077
Earth was once the planet
of the trilobites.

30:17.089 --> 30:20.366
But now they're all gone.
Extinct.

30:20.527 --> 30:22.996
The last of them
were swept from life's stage...

30:23.155 --> 30:29.413
...along with countless other species
in an unparalleled environmental disaster.

30:38.211 --> 30:42.091
The apocalypse
began in what is now Siberia...

30:42.257 --> 30:48.765
...with volcanic eruptions on a scale
unlike anything in human experience.

31:01.151 --> 31:03.404
Earth was very different then...

31:03.570 --> 31:07.746
...with one single supercontinent
and one great ocean.

31:07.908 --> 31:10.331
Relentless floods of fiery lava...

31:10.494 --> 31:13.794
...engulfed an area larger
than Western Europe.

31:13.955 --> 31:18.426
The pulsing eruptions went on for hundreds
of thousands of years.

31:18.585 --> 31:22.089
The molten rock ignited coal deposits
and polluted the air...

31:22.255 --> 31:25.805
...with carbon dioxide
and other greenhouse gases.

31:25.967 --> 31:27.219
This heated the Earth...

31:27.386 --> 31:31.357
...and stopped the ocean currents
from circulating.

31:45.946 --> 31:47.948
Noxious bacteria bloomed...

31:48.115 --> 31:51.836
...but nearly everything else
in the seas died.

31:51.993 --> 31:56.669
The stagnant waters belched
deadly hydrogen sulfide gas into the air...

31:56.832 --> 32:00.382
...which suffocated most
of the land animals.

32:13.181 --> 32:16.811
Nine in 10 of all species
on the planet went extinct.

32:17.853 --> 32:20.948
We call it the Great Dying.

32:33.702 --> 32:36.626
Life on Earth came so near
to being wiped out...

32:36.788 --> 32:40.088
...that it took more than
1O million years to recover.

32:40.250 --> 32:42.298
But new life-forms slowly evolved...

32:42.461 --> 32:46.261
...to fill the openings left
by the Permian holocaust.

32:53.972 --> 32:57.226
Among the biggest winners
were the dinosaurs.

32:57.392 --> 33:00.111
Now the Earth was their planet.

33:00.270 --> 33:04.320
Their reign continued
for over 150 million years.

33:04.483 --> 33:09.364
Until it too came crashing down
in another mass extinction.

33:09.821 --> 33:12.415
Life on Earth has taken quite a beating
over the eons.

33:12.574 --> 33:17.831
And yet it's still there.
The tenacity of life is mind-boggling.

33:17.996 --> 33:20.590
We keep finding it
where no one thought it could be.

33:25.420 --> 33:27.798
That nameless corridor?

33:28.465 --> 33:31.059
That's for another day.

33:36.348 --> 33:41.149
<i>I know an animal that can live
in boiling water or in solid ice.</i>

33:41.311 --> 33:44.485
<i>It can go 10 years without a drop of water.</i>

33:44.648 --> 33:46.650
<i>It can travel naked in the cold vacuum...</i>

33:46.816 --> 33:51.196
<i>...and intense radiation of space
and will return unscathed.</i>

33:51.363 --> 33:53.786
<i>The tardigrade, or water bear.</i>

33:53.949 --> 33:56.202
<i>It's equally at home
atop the tallest mountains...</i>

33:56.368 --> 33:58.837
<i>...and in the deepest trenches of the sea.</i>

33:58.995 --> 34:01.714
<i>And in our own backyards,
where they live among the moss...</i>

34:01.873 --> 34:04.171
<i>...in countless numbers.</i>

34:04.334 --> 34:07.304
You've probably never noticed them
because they're so small.

34:07.462 --> 34:09.464
About the size of a pinpoint.

34:09.630 --> 34:10.974
But they're tough.

34:11.132 --> 34:14.978
The tardigrades have survived
all five mass extinctions.

34:15.136 --> 34:17.810
They've been in business
for a half a billion years.

34:17.973 --> 34:21.273
We used to think that life was finicky,
that it would only take hold...

34:21.434 --> 34:24.233
...where it was not too
hot, not too cold...

34:24.396 --> 34:27.650
...not too dark or salty
or acidic or radioactive.

34:27.815 --> 34:30.945
<i>And whatever you do,
don't forget to add water.</i>

34:31.110 --> 34:34.489
<i>We were wrong.
As the hardy tardigrade demonstrates...</i>

34:34.656 --> 34:39.036
<i>...life can endure conditions that would
mean certain death for us humans.</i>

34:39.202 --> 34:41.204
But differences between us
and life found...

34:41.371 --> 34:43.998
...in even the most extreme environments
on our planet...

34:44.165 --> 34:49.547
...are only variations on a single theme,
dialects of a single language.

34:49.713 --> 34:51.806
The genetic code of Earth life.

34:56.886 --> 34:59.548
<i>But what would life be
like on other worlds?</i>

34:59.560 --> 35:02.234
<i>Worlds with a completely
different history...</i>

35:02.392 --> 35:05.612
<i>...chemistry and evolution from our planet?</i>

35:07.856 --> 35:11.326
<i>There's a distant world
I wanna take you to.</i>

35:11.901 --> 35:17.158
<i>A world far different from our own,
but one that may harbor life.</i>

35:17.324 --> 35:21.295
<i>If it does,
it promises to be unlike anything...</i>

35:21.453 --> 35:24.127
<i>...we've ever seen before.</i>

35:43.224 --> 35:46.444
Clouds and haze completely hide
the surface of Titan...

35:46.603 --> 35:48.731
...Saturn's giant moon.

35:48.897 --> 35:51.491
Titan reminds me a little bit of home.

35:51.650 --> 35:54.529
Like Earth, it has an atmosphere
that's mostly nitrogen.

35:54.694 --> 35:56.742
But it's four times denser.

35:56.905 --> 35:59.533
Titan's air has no oxygen at all.

35:59.699 --> 36:06.048
And it's far colder than anywhere on Earth.
But still, I wanna go there.

36:08.375 --> 36:11.845
<i>We have to descend through
a couple hundred kilometers of smog...</i>

36:12.003 --> 36:14.597
<i>...before we can even see the surface.</i>

36:14.756 --> 36:19.603
<i>But hidden beneath
lies a weirdly familiar landscape.</i>

36:27.394 --> 36:31.649
Titan is the only other world
in the solar system where it ever rains.

36:31.815 --> 36:35.285
<i>It has rivers and coastlines.</i>

36:39.656 --> 36:45.288
Titan has hundreds of lakes. One of them
larger than Lake Superior in North America.

36:45.453 --> 36:49.253
Vapor rising from the lakes condenses
and falls again as rain.

36:50.792 --> 36:53.011
<i>The rain feeds rivers...</i>

36:53.795 --> 36:59.393
<i>...which carve valleys into the landscape,
just like on Earth.</i>

37:00.969 --> 37:02.937
But with one big difference.

37:03.096 --> 37:05.474
On Titan, the seas and the rain...

37:05.640 --> 37:09.690
...are made not of water,
but of methane and ethane.

37:09.853 --> 37:12.527
On Earth, those molecules form natural gas.

37:14.107 --> 37:17.532
<i>On frigid Titan, they're liquid.</i>

37:22.991 --> 37:27.622
Titan has lots of water
but all of it is frozen hard as rock.

37:27.787 --> 37:32.543
In fact, the landscape and mountains
are made mainly of water ice.

37:32.709 --> 37:34.882
At hundreds of degrees below zero...

37:35.044 --> 37:38.548
...Titan is far too cold
for water to ever be liquid.

37:40.759 --> 37:44.104
<i>Astrobiologists since Carl Sagan
have wondered...</i>

37:44.262 --> 37:47.983
<i>...if life might swim
in Titan's hydrocarbon lakes.</i>

37:49.893 --> 37:51.645
The chemical basis for such life...

37:51.811 --> 37:55.441
...would have to be entirely different
from anything we know.

37:55.607 --> 38:00.488
All life on Earth depends on liquid water,
and Titan's surface has none of that.

38:00.653 --> 38:02.951
But we can imagine other kinds of life.

38:03.114 --> 38:07.164
There might be creatures that
inhale hydrogen instead of oxygen.

38:07.327 --> 38:10.422
And exhale methane
instead of carbon dioxide.

38:10.580 --> 38:14.050
They might use acetylene
instead of sugar as an energy source.

38:14.209 --> 38:16.553
How could we find out if such creatures...

38:16.711 --> 38:21.012
...rule a hidden empire
beneath the oil-dark waves?

38:36.523 --> 38:39.868
<i>We're diving down deep
into the Kraken Sea...</i>

38:40.026 --> 38:43.246
<i>...named for the mythic
Norse sea monster.</i>

38:46.074 --> 38:49.749
<i>Even if there is one of those down there,
we probably couldn't see it.</i>

38:49.911 --> 38:52.209
<i>It's so dark.</i>

38:53.331 --> 38:56.756
<i>If you took all the oil
and natural gas on Earth...</i>

38:56.918 --> 39:00.764
<i>...it would amount to but a tiny fraction
of Titan's reserves.</i>

39:04.259 --> 39:06.603
<i>Let's turn on some lights.</i>

39:10.682 --> 39:14.607
<i>We're now 200 meters beneath the surface.</i>

39:18.356 --> 39:22.987
<i>Did you see something?
Over there, by that vent.</i>

39:23.152 --> 39:27.077
<i>Maybe it was just my imagination.
I guess we'll have to come back...</i>

39:27.240 --> 39:29.493
<i>...if we want to find out for sure.</i>

39:32.954 --> 39:36.333
<i>There's one last story I want to tell you.</i>

39:36.499 --> 39:40.549
And it's the greatest story
science has ever told.

39:44.924 --> 39:49.100
<i>It's the story of life on our world.</i>

40:11.034 --> 40:13.878
Welcome to the Earth
of four billion years ago.

40:14.829 --> 40:17.833
This was our planet before life.

40:17.999 --> 40:20.548
Nobody knows how life got started.

40:20.710 --> 40:23.133
Most of the evidence
from that time was destroyed...

40:23.296 --> 40:25.674
...by impact and erosion.

40:25.840 --> 40:29.515
Science works on the frontier
between knowledge and ignorance.

40:29.677 --> 40:31.896
We're not afraid to admit
what we don't know.

40:32.055 --> 40:33.728
There's no shame in that.

40:33.890 --> 40:37.861
The only shame is to pretend
that we have all the answers.

40:38.019 --> 40:39.441
Maybe someone watching this...

40:39.604 --> 40:44.826
...will be the first to solve the mystery
of how life on Earth began.

40:52.075 --> 40:53.793
The evidence from living microbes...

40:53.952 --> 40:57.422
...suggest that their earliest ancestors
preferred high temperatures.

40:58.081 --> 41:02.712
Life on Earth may have arisen in hot water
around submerged volcanic vents.

41:07.548 --> 41:09.926
<i>In Carl Sagan's original Cosmos series...</i>

41:10.093 --> 41:12.767
<i>...he traced the unbroken thread
that stretches...</i>

41:12.929 --> 41:15.182
<i>...directly from the
one-celled organisms...</i>

41:15.348 --> 41:19.649
<i>...of nearly four billion years ago to you.</i>

41:19.811 --> 41:23.111
<i>Four billion years in 40 seconds.</i>

41:23.272 --> 41:26.617
<i>From creatures
who had yet to discern day from night...</i>

41:26.776 --> 41:31.498
<i>...to beings who are exploring the cosmos.</i>

42:19.412 --> 42:22.791
<i><font color="#808080">SAGAN :</font> Those are some of the things
that molecules do...</i>

42:22.957 --> 42:26.461
<i>...given four billion years of evolution.</i>
