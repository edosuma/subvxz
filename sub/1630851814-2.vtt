WEBVTT

00:50.842 --> 00:53.428
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION
BASED IN A DYSTOPIAN KOREA

00:53.511 --> 00:56.514
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS ARE FICTITIOUS

01:26.961 --> 01:28.922
Judge Kim. What are you doing?

01:32.509 --> 01:33.802
Good work today, Judge Kim.

01:35.720 --> 01:37.263
Thank you for your hard work today.

01:38.640 --> 01:40.767
-Good work.
-Please, I didn't do much.

01:40.850 --> 01:42.310
Thank you for your hard work.

01:46.272 --> 01:48.900
Since you worked so hard,
how about I treat you to dinner?

01:48.983 --> 01:49.943
I'd love that.

01:54.781 --> 01:56.449
If you'd rather not, that's fine with me.

01:58.159 --> 01:59.369
Yes, sir.

02:10.255 --> 02:12.048
Now I can finally breathe.

02:12.132 --> 02:15.260
I almost peed my pants
because I was that nervous.

02:15.844 --> 02:18.972
Judge Kim. Were you not nervous at all?

02:19.055 --> 02:22.559
I mean, there were lights everywhere,
and all the cameras were pointing at us.

02:22.642 --> 02:25.854
I felt like I was stripped bare,
in the middle of the street.

02:25.937 --> 02:27.480
-Judge Oh.
-Yes?

02:27.564 --> 02:29.941
Is it normal to have tears when yawning?

02:31.276 --> 02:32.277
Well…

02:33.361 --> 02:36.114
My eyes do water when I yawn.

02:36.197 --> 02:37.532
Why do you ask?

02:39.325 --> 02:40.535
It's nothing.

02:40.618 --> 02:41.995
But…

02:42.996 --> 02:44.497
wasn't that kind of thrilling?

02:44.581 --> 02:47.250
You know,
to have the entire nation watching you?

02:48.459 --> 02:51.546
Of course, they were probably
looking at Judge Kang,

02:53.047 --> 02:54.007
and not me.

02:56.801 --> 02:57.969
Judge Oh?

02:59.929 --> 03:02.140
I meant I'm so relieved
they weren't looking at me.

03:02.223 --> 03:05.643
If they were, I bet you I'd have caused
trouble from the nervousness.

03:08.605 --> 03:11.024
By the way, aren't you excited?

03:11.107 --> 03:13.526
Judge Kang said he'll treat us to dinner.

03:13.610 --> 03:14.777
-Excited?
-Yes!

03:15.612 --> 03:18.698
I hear Judge Kang
is the heir of a large fortune.

03:18.781 --> 03:21.409
He must be a gourmet, then.

03:28.416 --> 03:31.169
Judge Kang,
what do you do in your pastime?

03:32.003 --> 03:33.838
Do you play golf or tennis, maybe?

03:33.922 --> 03:35.715
-Hunting.
-Hunting?

03:35.798 --> 03:39.427
As in, bang! With the gun
to catch rabbits and such?

03:39.510 --> 03:42.764
Oh no, they're too boring.
The bigger ones are more entertaining.

03:53.691 --> 03:54.776
This looks delicious.

03:56.152 --> 03:57.403
What is this?

03:57.904 --> 03:58.863
Wild boar.

03:58.947 --> 04:00.448
A very big one too.

04:00.990 --> 04:03.534
-Wild…
-They have a hunting license.

04:04.869 --> 04:05.870
Awesome.

04:06.663 --> 04:07.830
It's extremely thrilling.

04:08.790 --> 04:10.625
To fire a bullet
right between its two eyes

04:10.708 --> 04:12.794
as they charge at me, baring their fangs.

04:15.046 --> 04:16.297
-How are you finding it?
-Yes?

04:16.381 --> 04:20.301
-This boar, I mean.
-It's very distinct but with rich flavors.

04:21.594 --> 04:24.264
I envy you. I have a poor palate.

04:24.347 --> 04:27.475
To me, food is… Well, how should I put it?

04:30.270 --> 04:31.479
It's more for the texture.

04:31.562 --> 04:33.606
Texture?

04:33.690 --> 04:37.652
Biting it into bits with your incisors,
grinding with your molars,

04:37.735 --> 04:40.154
and tearing at it with your fangs.

04:40.738 --> 04:42.407
It's like feeling the flesh
with your teeth.

04:42.490 --> 04:44.826
"Fangs" are for animals, not humans.

04:44.909 --> 04:47.495
-But aren't humans also animals?
-It's "teeth" for humans.

04:50.873 --> 04:53.584
Fangs, teeth. Same thing.

04:53.668 --> 04:55.753
Anyway, what do you mean
you have a poor palate?

04:55.837 --> 05:00.008
Maybe you had fine delicacies since young
and it desensitized your palate?

05:00.591 --> 05:02.093
Since I was young?

05:04.429 --> 05:06.180
You were a young master, weren't you?

05:06.264 --> 05:07.932
Born into a wealthy family.

05:12.186 --> 05:13.563
Born into a wealthy family…

05:21.195 --> 05:23.489
Did I make a faux pas?

05:23.573 --> 05:26.784
No, not at all. I was born
with a silver spoon in my mouth.

05:27.285 --> 05:28.369
But you know what?

05:29.162 --> 05:30.705
My late father

05:32.582 --> 05:34.042
was a loan shark.

05:35.043 --> 05:37.670
Second-generation, and quite notorious.

05:38.254 --> 05:39.464
For being merciless?

05:40.214 --> 05:41.674
Judge Kim!

05:41.758 --> 05:44.510
So you know the crux of private loans.

05:44.594 --> 05:47.388
I take it you grew up
in a debt-ridden family?

05:47.972 --> 05:49.515
Do you do background checks on us?

05:49.599 --> 05:52.393
We're one judiciary panel,
so we should know each other.

05:52.894 --> 05:54.479
Your father took his own life

05:54.562 --> 05:58.232
after losing his entire savings
to a fraud, didn't he?

06:06.074 --> 06:07.867
Oh, my bad.

06:07.950 --> 06:09.494
I shouldn't have said that.

06:10.411 --> 06:12.580
Pretending to have a heart
when you're merciless…

06:12.663 --> 06:16.125
-Isn't that the crux of private loans?
-Judge Kim, you know he didn't mean--

06:16.209 --> 06:18.002
So you know very well.

06:18.086 --> 06:21.214
It's all about selling hope
and receiving it back through fear.

06:22.048 --> 06:24.467
My father would regularly
go to confession,

06:25.134 --> 06:27.387
<i>whenever his debtors took their own lives.</i>

06:27.470 --> 06:30.139
I acknowledged my sin to you,
and I did not cover my iniquity.

06:30.223 --> 06:33.226
I said, "I will confess
my transgressions to the Lord,"

06:33.309 --> 06:36.187
and you forgave the iniquity of my sin.

06:39.690 --> 06:40.566
Why?

06:40.650 --> 06:43.277
Can't you imagine me growing up
under such a man?

06:45.905 --> 06:48.116
-Now, if you'll excuse me...
-Judge Kim.

06:51.077 --> 06:52.662
I'm not feeling too well.

06:53.913 --> 06:55.123
I have a weak stomach.

08:16.287 --> 08:17.205
Where are you?

08:17.288 --> 08:19.373
-<i>I'm on a safari.</i>
-Again?

08:20.041 --> 08:21.751
<i>Just get over here, man.</i>

08:21.834 --> 08:23.336
<i>I've set it all up.</i>

08:23.419 --> 08:24.754
Let me have some more fun.

08:30.968 --> 08:33.221
SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY FOUNDATION

08:48.110 --> 08:49.529
Those pathetic tramps.

09:06.254 --> 09:07.338
Are you all right?

09:08.005 --> 09:09.131
Oh, dear.

09:12.969 --> 09:14.512
I'm so sorry.

09:16.430 --> 09:18.057
You should've been more careful.

09:41.038 --> 09:43.499
<i>To protect the underprivileged,</i>

09:44.000 --> 09:45.876
<i>the Social Responsibility Foundation…</i>

09:59.557 --> 10:03.853
This Court imposes a cumulative punishment
for each of the 47 victims!

10:04.437 --> 10:06.939
I sentence you to 235 years in prison.

10:18.951 --> 10:22.413
Do they think trials are a joke?
Two hundred and thirty-five years?

10:25.207 --> 10:26.709
Was this your plan all along?

10:28.294 --> 10:31.339
Kang Yo-han and the way he had tears
in his eyes as he called out--

10:31.422 --> 10:33.841
Oh that? That's actually quite difficult.

10:33.924 --> 10:37.386
I've done it a lot in my days as an actor.
Crying at the right moment?

10:37.470 --> 10:38.804
That's some skills, you know.

10:39.680 --> 10:41.223
I wonder how he did it

10:41.974 --> 10:43.601
without turning to eye drops?

10:43.684 --> 10:45.478
Did he use tear sticks?

10:45.978 --> 10:49.231
I was fine with pretty much
everything else when I was an actor,

10:49.315 --> 10:50.441
but the crying scenes…

10:50.524 --> 10:53.527
That was my weakness,
and what held me back from lead roles.

10:55.529 --> 10:58.783
But you've realized your long-term wish,
have you not? The lead role, I mean.

11:00.785 --> 11:01.702
Well…

11:02.995 --> 11:04.080
Am I really the lead?

11:05.039 --> 11:10.961
With all these powerful figures
lined up beside me,

11:11.629 --> 11:14.423
I'm still not sure where I stand exactly.

11:17.468 --> 11:20.721
But you should be very aware.
Isn't it obvious already?

11:20.805 --> 11:25.101
You are the master
of this precarious country.

11:28.646 --> 11:31.732
So, Minister Cha.
I see that the loss of President Joo

11:31.816 --> 11:33.275
was a heavy blow for you.

11:34.527 --> 11:39.073
I mean, you wouldn't bat an eye
locking up other conglomerates,

11:39.156 --> 11:42.743
but seeing you get overly worked up
over President Joo's demise

11:42.827 --> 11:45.663
is making me wonder
if there's something else.

11:48.040 --> 11:49.875
Just saying.

11:49.959 --> 11:52.962
As you know, I do have a wild imagination.

11:53.045 --> 11:55.756
I'm a former actor. An artist, remember?

12:00.720 --> 12:05.599
Anyway,
the first trial was your big picture.

12:05.683 --> 12:06.517
Was it not?

12:08.602 --> 12:11.188
I don't think the foundation
would be too pleased either.

12:11.272 --> 12:13.607
-They just lost one of their most--
-No.

12:16.068 --> 12:19.280
Chairman Seo seemed unaffected by it.

12:22.283 --> 12:25.453
SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY FOUNDATION

12:50.811 --> 12:51.937
Minister.

12:55.900 --> 12:57.860
Is Chairman Seo in?

12:58.819 --> 13:00.321
He's in meditation.

13:00.905 --> 13:03.407
To turn up unannounced like this
is a little…

13:04.241 --> 13:06.076
Step aside.

13:06.160 --> 13:08.662
How dare a secretary like you
stand in my way?

13:10.581 --> 13:13.250
You're putting us
in a difficult situation, Minister.

13:13.334 --> 13:14.210
Difficult?

13:14.710 --> 13:17.338
Don't you think
you've got on your high horse?

13:17.421 --> 13:19.298
With the President being nice to you,

13:19.381 --> 13:21.300
do you think
you can advise on state affairs?

13:23.385 --> 13:24.595
Very well.

13:53.374 --> 13:54.208
Can we talk?

14:01.674 --> 14:03.050
Can't you hear me?

14:03.133 --> 14:06.303
Livid, are you?
That it didn't go as you wished?

14:06.387 --> 14:07.346
What did you say?

14:07.429 --> 14:09.765
Why come here

14:13.727 --> 14:16.188
and raise a commotion?

14:17.606 --> 14:19.191
That should be my line.

14:19.817 --> 14:22.278
Who was it that threw
a monkey in the works again?

14:23.320 --> 14:27.032
How dare you stab me in the back
with Kang Yo-han?

14:27.116 --> 14:28.993
I'm really not sure what you're on about.

14:29.076 --> 14:30.494
Oh, so you'll feign ignorance?

14:35.416 --> 14:38.377
I'm sure Judge Kang had his reasons.

14:38.460 --> 14:41.672
Winning over the public
with a case of this size

14:41.755 --> 14:43.716
is not so bad
when you look at it in the long run.

14:43.799 --> 14:47.386
Then are you saying it was Heo Jung-se
who coaxed him into this?

14:47.469 --> 14:49.638
I wouldn't come to a hasty conclusion.

14:49.722 --> 14:50.806
Think wisely.

14:51.765 --> 14:53.475
Will it really be to your benefit

14:53.559 --> 14:55.519
to have betrayed me
to take Heo Jung-se's hand?

14:55.603 --> 14:57.438
I won't just sit and watch, you know.

14:58.564 --> 15:01.317
If you're done, I suggest you leave.

15:25.591 --> 15:27.217
That old weasel.

15:29.887 --> 15:31.388
Do you really think the recent trial

15:32.473 --> 15:34.642
came with just the negative consequences?

15:38.520 --> 15:39.730
What did you say?

15:39.813 --> 15:42.900
An opinion poll
was just published with 17%.

15:42.983 --> 15:46.153
The ruling party saw
as much as a 17% increase in support.

15:49.990 --> 15:53.619
And aren't you the next favorite candidate
for the presidency?

15:53.702 --> 15:57.831
And I'm sure there are many conglomerates
wishing to build connections with you.

15:57.915 --> 16:00.960
Conglomerates of bigger scale
than JU Chemicals.

16:02.711 --> 16:03.837
What did you say?

16:05.005 --> 16:08.175
Oh, my apologies. I stepped out of line.

16:09.802 --> 16:11.261
After all, I'm just a secretary.

16:25.943 --> 16:26.944
Professor.

16:27.611 --> 16:29.446
How many times has it been already?

16:47.589 --> 16:48.632
Are you all right?

16:57.933 --> 16:59.476
I can't believe this.

16:59.560 --> 17:02.146
How could you cheat your own student?

17:02.229 --> 17:03.605
You, Justice Min!

17:03.689 --> 17:06.108
It was a fakeout, not cheating.

17:17.286 --> 17:18.787
I still don't get it.

17:21.457 --> 17:24.418
I thought this trial was all for show,
but instead…

17:28.380 --> 17:31.300
I'm having a harder time
deciphering their intentions.

17:32.259 --> 17:35.012
The approval ratings have shot up
for the incumbent president too.

17:36.889 --> 17:40.601
There must be some secret dealing
which we're not aware of just yet.

17:42.227 --> 17:45.606
Still, I think
it worked out well in the end.

17:46.106 --> 17:48.734
Work out well?
Is that how a trial should be?

17:49.318 --> 17:50.861
As long as it ends well, it's fine?

17:51.862 --> 17:53.072
No, of course not.

17:53.155 --> 17:55.074
A trial is not a child's game.

17:56.492 --> 18:00.245
Let me look into it further
about what really went on.

18:06.877 --> 18:09.004
I'm sorry, Judge Kim.

18:09.713 --> 18:11.131
I don't really mind, but…

18:12.132 --> 18:13.258
"Judge Kim."

18:14.093 --> 18:15.844
That just gave me goosebumps.

18:16.762 --> 18:20.474
"You damned punk, you want a piece of me?"
That's more like it.

18:20.557 --> 18:23.894
Well, that was for the Kim Ga-on
back in his delinquent days.

18:23.977 --> 18:26.188
You mean
when you were a hooligan professor.

18:26.271 --> 18:27.272
What was it that you said?

18:27.356 --> 18:30.317
"You liked the smell of the earth?
Should I bury you in it?"

18:30.400 --> 18:32.778
Was that something to say to a poor kid?

18:32.861 --> 18:36.949
How dare you slander a justice
with false information?

18:50.546 --> 18:53.632
<i>Is it all ready?</i>
<i>Did you meet with that Doc?</i>

18:53.715 --> 18:56.260
<i>My colleagues call me "Dr. Safety."</i>

18:57.886 --> 19:01.557
<i>What if he'd been referring to</i>
<i>Jang Gi-hyeon and not Yoo Jong-baek?</i>

19:05.394 --> 19:06.436
Yes.

19:07.354 --> 19:08.564
Thank you.

19:08.647 --> 19:09.898
Thank you, sir.

19:12.192 --> 19:13.026
Judge Kim.

19:14.319 --> 19:15.779
I'm here to return this.

19:16.405 --> 19:18.157
I see you came during the day this time.

19:20.534 --> 19:22.202
There's something that's been bugging me.

19:22.286 --> 19:24.580
Really? We can't have that now,

19:24.663 --> 19:28.292
not when you're my precious stooge
who sits on my left.

19:30.961 --> 19:33.255
-What did you just say?
-Sit down, and let's talk.

19:42.055 --> 19:43.015
So what is it about?

19:44.558 --> 19:46.602
It's about Mr. Jang,
the witness at the recent trial.

19:46.685 --> 19:49.062
-Yes, you mean Dr. Safety?
-Yes.

19:49.646 --> 19:50.564
What about him?

19:50.647 --> 19:53.317
-Can he be trusted?
-What do you mean?

19:53.400 --> 19:55.110
I've never seen a witness who overturns

19:55.194 --> 19:57.196
such an important testimony
on his own free will.

19:57.779 --> 20:00.782
-He must've felt a pang of conscience.
-A pang of conscience?

20:00.866 --> 20:04.828
Why? I take it you don't believe in
such a thing as human conscience?

20:06.038 --> 20:09.875
Well, I couldn't be touched
because I could see where this was going.

20:09.958 --> 20:10.792
See what?

20:10.876 --> 20:13.921
Didn't he accuse
the defendant of willful murder?

20:14.004 --> 20:16.506
-And you'd agree enthusiastically.
-Enthusiastically?

20:16.590 --> 20:18.675
That's when you began
to be assertive in your actions.

20:18.759 --> 20:20.302
You kept a passive stance before that.

20:20.385 --> 20:24.097
I asked what if something happens
to the elderly in the village.

20:24.181 --> 20:25.015
And?

20:25.098 --> 20:28.185
President Joo said, "Those old geezers
lived long enough, so who cares?"

20:28.268 --> 20:30.520
Did you really say such a thing?

20:30.604 --> 20:33.023
Deep down I thought, "Isn't this murder?"

20:33.857 --> 20:34.900
Murder?

20:37.444 --> 20:39.821
You were looking at me
the entire time, weren't you?

20:41.406 --> 20:44.159
-No.
-Did we find the murder to be intentional?

20:45.494 --> 20:47.287
-No, but--
-Then what's the problem?

20:47.371 --> 20:49.623
Because of that,
the Defendant modified his statement

20:49.706 --> 20:52.542
-to contend professional negligence.
-Then isn't it all for the better?

20:53.502 --> 20:56.213
-Does only the result matter?
-The proceedings should be just also?

20:56.296 --> 20:58.715
Of course. That's what a trial
and the rule of law is.

20:59.466 --> 21:01.802
Rule of law, you say… Judge Kim.

21:02.761 --> 21:06.598
-Is justice the real purpose of a trial?
-If it's not for justice, then what?

21:08.225 --> 21:11.895
A trial is a game.
Fail to serve evidence, and you lose.

21:11.979 --> 21:14.314
But it's not a fair game to start with.

21:14.398 --> 21:17.109
Manipulating, hiding the truth,
bribing investigative authorities…

21:17.192 --> 21:19.444
The powerful will do
whatever they need to.

21:19.528 --> 21:23.115
On the other side is just the public,
angry and lamenting in fury.

21:24.616 --> 21:26.159
<i>How could you accuse</i>

21:26.243 --> 21:28.537
a patriotic businessman
of being a murderer?

21:28.620 --> 21:32.833
Do you know how many people
are able to make a living thanks to me?

21:34.835 --> 21:37.963
It's sad, but there is no justice
in the real world.

21:38.630 --> 21:40.173
Only a game exists.

21:40.257 --> 21:42.217
A game that's terribly unfair.

22:02.738 --> 22:03.989
He's just like him.

22:06.575 --> 22:07.909
Too much like him.

22:14.458 --> 22:15.459
Hey, Ga-on.

22:16.626 --> 22:17.878
No, it's okay. Go on.

22:20.339 --> 22:21.631
You want to see me?

22:23.550 --> 22:25.010
I'm a little busy right now.

22:27.387 --> 22:29.139
No, there's no need.

22:29.222 --> 22:31.224
I'll try and make time for you.

22:32.768 --> 22:33.852
All right.

22:37.856 --> 22:39.191
Off on a date, are you?

22:41.026 --> 22:42.944
You just be quiet.

22:44.112 --> 22:44.988
Yes, ma'am.

22:51.203 --> 22:54.122
<i>And did you meet with that Doc?</i>
<i>Yes, good work.</i>

22:54.206 --> 22:56.041
<i>I'll meet with his attorney tonight.</i>

22:58.418 --> 23:01.088
-So you wanted to see me about this?
-Yes.

23:02.631 --> 23:04.299
-Are you on a stakeout?
-Yes.

23:04.383 --> 23:07.427
-I'm off to catch a mean criminal. Why?
-It suits you.

23:09.721 --> 23:11.139
What wouldn't suit me?

23:12.224 --> 23:16.937
Anyway, so this cheating girlfriend
of yours is your boss, is it?

23:17.020 --> 23:18.897
Talk about taste.

23:18.980 --> 23:22.067
-Do you really have to?
-That's the excuse you used.

23:22.150 --> 23:24.236
Anyway, eavesdropping on some guy's call…

23:24.319 --> 23:26.363
I already told you
why I found him suspicious.

23:27.322 --> 23:29.533
Didn't you think it's odd too?

23:29.616 --> 23:31.535
About that site manager.

23:34.287 --> 23:35.914
You've interviewed many victims too.

23:35.997 --> 23:38.792
What usually drives people
to suddenly confess their secrets?

23:38.875 --> 23:40.752
I just want to die, Your Honor.

23:41.294 --> 23:42.712
Well, you know human beings.

23:42.796 --> 23:45.841
Sometimes they do listen
to what their conscience has to say.

23:45.924 --> 23:47.342
Stop fooling around.

23:50.137 --> 23:53.515
I guess to save their ass.
You know that already, so why ask?

23:56.017 --> 23:58.728
What if this "Doc" he mentioned
is really that witness?

24:01.064 --> 24:04.317
Are you saying your boss
tampered with the witness?

24:04.401 --> 24:07.362
Well, anything is possible with him.

24:08.071 --> 24:12.701
Hey, he's a national hero right now.
He's the people's favorite judge.

24:14.453 --> 24:16.913
Don't you go around saying such a thing.
You might get attacked.

24:31.178 --> 24:33.138
Darn it, out of my way.

24:42.272 --> 24:44.149
Thank you.

24:45.192 --> 24:48.778
Your warm helping hand
will bring hope to many.

24:48.862 --> 24:50.697
It's because you do things
that annoy Ji-yeon.

24:50.780 --> 24:55.118
That's why she's picking a fight.
How many times has it been already?

25:00.457 --> 25:01.833
Mom!

25:12.719 --> 25:14.930
Practice defensive driving, will you?

25:17.557 --> 25:19.476
Hey, you! Drive properly!

25:20.143 --> 25:21.520
Are you all right?

25:22.354 --> 25:23.355
I've seen that car before.

25:23.939 --> 25:26.650
That's why you shouldn't hold up
everyone on the road!

25:29.110 --> 25:30.737
Hey! That crazy…

25:35.325 --> 25:36.326
Hey!

25:43.416 --> 25:44.334
Be careful!

26:13.738 --> 26:14.823
Just a little faster.

26:19.452 --> 26:21.871
-I think we'll lose him.
-We can't catch up to him, no way.

26:48.273 --> 26:49.190
Hey, what is that?

26:55.864 --> 26:57.198
What?

26:57.282 --> 26:58.450
What the…

27:02.287 --> 27:03.622
Crazy bastard.

28:16.403 --> 28:17.570
That crazy psycho.

28:21.199 --> 28:23.034
Hey, you psycho!

28:23.118 --> 28:24.369
Get lost!

29:34.105 --> 29:35.732
Hey, you psycho!

29:35.815 --> 29:37.734
Do you have a death wish or something?

29:37.817 --> 29:39.778
-There he is. Pull over.
-Hey.

29:40.695 --> 29:42.238
I said, do you have a death wish?

29:43.364 --> 29:45.074
This guy's a complete nutcase!

29:45.158 --> 29:46.826
Hey!

29:47.327 --> 29:48.244
That crazy…

29:48.328 --> 29:50.288
Hey!

29:50.872 --> 29:53.291
Who the hell are you, bastard? Hey!

29:54.876 --> 29:56.711
-Hey! You bastard…
-That's him, isn't it?

29:56.795 --> 29:58.129
-Kang Yo-han.
-Hey!

29:58.213 --> 29:59.297
-Yes.
-Hey!

30:01.132 --> 30:05.136
Look at this bastard. He's gone nuts!
What the hell are you doing?

30:19.025 --> 30:21.778
What the…

30:21.861 --> 30:24.322
Hey, who the hell are you?
Don't come any closer.

30:24.405 --> 30:26.199
Don't!

30:26.866 --> 30:28.576
Put that down.

30:28.660 --> 30:30.537
Don't come near me! Hey!

30:31.621 --> 30:34.123
You bastard… Who the hell are you?

30:36.125 --> 30:37.126
Hey.

30:38.628 --> 30:39.838
Hey!

30:55.562 --> 30:57.230
That crazy psycho…

31:06.948 --> 31:09.909
You're that judge
who was on TV, aren't you?

31:10.869 --> 31:12.829
Why the hell are you doing this to me?

31:13.329 --> 31:15.081
Because you were in my way.

31:18.501 --> 31:19.502
Darn it.

31:21.921 --> 31:23.882
You're just a mere judge. How dare you!

31:23.965 --> 31:25.884
Do you know who I am?

31:26.384 --> 31:28.177
I won't let you get away with this.

31:29.095 --> 31:30.221
Just you wait!

31:35.518 --> 31:36.686
Hey, you…

31:38.563 --> 31:41.649
This isn't mine. Where did you get this?
I swear this isn't mine.

31:41.733 --> 31:45.236
What matters is
that I found this in your car.

31:45.320 --> 31:47.030
With your fingerprint on it too.

31:47.113 --> 31:49.157
I'm confiscating this. And…

31:50.408 --> 31:52.410
If you haven't earned this,
take the subway.

32:01.210 --> 32:02.462
What the…

32:08.885 --> 32:10.053
Hey.

32:11.220 --> 32:12.388
Hey!

32:17.310 --> 32:18.269
You…

32:18.353 --> 32:20.813
Hey!

32:30.907 --> 32:33.034
What did I just see?

32:33.701 --> 32:35.203
Now will you believe me?

32:59.227 --> 33:00.436
Welcome home.

33:01.771 --> 33:03.398
-Did you stay up all night?
-Yes.

33:03.982 --> 33:06.526
What I lack in skills,
I have to make up with effort.

33:06.609 --> 33:08.653
Don't say that.

33:08.736 --> 33:11.739
I know it too, you know.
That I was picked for my looks.

33:12.824 --> 33:15.410
Still, people are expecting
something from me.

33:15.493 --> 33:18.121
So I really want to do this well.

33:23.376 --> 33:25.253
<i>-Hello?</i>
-Hey.

33:25.336 --> 33:28.631
-I'm on my way to Mr. Jang's place.
-Why?

33:28.715 --> 33:29.549
<i>"Why?"</i>

33:29.632 --> 33:32.468
<i>We'll have to see what was behind</i>
<i>that testimony of his.</i>

33:32.552 --> 33:34.470
It's not your business.
I can take care of it.

33:34.554 --> 33:36.723
Look at you, giving me the cold shoulder.

33:37.390 --> 33:39.684
<i>Hey, I'm Yoon Su-hyeon,</i>
<i>the ace in our team.</i>

33:40.977 --> 33:44.022
And I won't put up with judges who cheat.

33:45.106 --> 33:46.482
<i>I'm onto him,</i>

33:47.150 --> 33:48.026
<i>Kang Yo-han.</i>

33:51.195 --> 33:52.238
Hello.

33:53.531 --> 33:54.699
Who are you?

33:54.782 --> 33:57.201
I'm Inspector Yoon Su-hyeon,
from the WAIS.

33:57.285 --> 33:59.203
Are you here to help me look for a job

33:59.287 --> 34:01.456
now that I got fired for whistleblowing?

34:01.539 --> 34:03.624
-What?
-If not, please leave.

34:03.708 --> 34:06.586
My entire family's left to starve
thanks to my conscience.

34:07.670 --> 34:08.963
Mr. Jang Gi-hyeon!

34:24.187 --> 34:27.356
They paid a visit to Jang Gi-hyeon,
as you expected.

34:29.317 --> 34:31.235
<i>Judge Kim had come to me,</i>

34:32.236 --> 34:34.447
<i>saying he finds Jang Gi-hyeon suspicious.</i>

34:35.990 --> 34:37.408
But I understand.

34:38.576 --> 34:41.412
Who knew there's still a witness
out there in this world,

34:41.496 --> 34:42.663
<i>who's so courageous?</i>

34:49.837 --> 34:51.380
Honestly, I was surprised myself.

34:55.301 --> 34:56.385
<i>Water?</i>

34:56.886 --> 34:59.680
Yes, there definitely was
something in that water.

34:59.764 --> 35:02.058
I started to cough like crazy
and felt dizzy.

35:02.141 --> 35:04.185
I almost crashed my car thanks to that.

35:04.268 --> 35:06.646
But you're saying now you're just fine?

35:07.188 --> 35:09.857
After a while, I was back to normal.

35:09.941 --> 35:14.070
But just in case, I took a blood test
but they found nothing.

35:15.029 --> 35:17.406
It really is bizarre.

35:17.490 --> 35:18.866
<i>The witnesses?</i>

35:18.950 --> 35:20.660
<i>We all have our positions.</i>

35:21.536 --> 35:23.412
<i>There's nothing to worry about.</i>

35:23.496 --> 35:25.706
<i>It's Joo Il-do</i>
<i>who laid down his cards in fear.</i>

35:27.667 --> 35:29.418
<i>We have to do something, don't we?</i>

35:29.502 --> 35:31.879
<i>When our playing ground</i>
<i>is tilted against us.</i>

35:55.486 --> 35:57.280
I see. Thanks, Su-hyeon.

36:04.829 --> 36:06.789
Hey, what is this?

36:07.582 --> 36:10.710
-Thanks for meeting all those witnesses.
-I didn't know you could cook these too.

36:10.793 --> 36:12.712
Stews and stir-fried pork
were all you could make.

36:13.629 --> 36:16.591
-Fine, don't have any.
-There's coffee and everything.

36:16.674 --> 36:18.759
You'll make the perfect husband, Ga-on.

36:19.677 --> 36:21.554
So, who are you going to marry?

36:21.637 --> 36:22.763
Come on, let's go up.

36:22.847 --> 36:24.807
-Who are you going to--
-It's going to get cold.

36:24.891 --> 36:25.725
Okay.

36:27.685 --> 36:30.313
Anyway, this really is suspicious.

36:30.396 --> 36:32.940
Maybe I should do some more digging
on Kang Yo-han.

36:33.024 --> 36:35.693
I've been looking up
all that I could, but…

36:35.776 --> 36:37.486
-Su-hyeon.
-Yes?

36:41.407 --> 36:44.827
There were these people
I bumped into by coincidence,

36:45.661 --> 36:48.289
<i>and all of them would hold my hands tight.</i>

36:48.915 --> 36:50.833
<i>Thanking me for this recent trial.</i>

36:51.542 --> 36:53.669
<i>Saying they're happy</i>
<i>to have someone they can trust.</i>

36:55.588 --> 36:56.589
And?

36:57.715 --> 37:01.219
But that doesn't mean a judge is allowed
to do crazy things like Kang Yo-han.

37:01.302 --> 37:03.930
What you heard and saw were odd enough.

37:04.889 --> 37:06.349
And cheating is cheating.

37:07.266 --> 37:08.726
That's a crime too.

37:12.438 --> 37:13.898
Yes, you're right.

37:15.900 --> 37:18.444
-Let me know if you have anything.
-Sure.

37:19.862 --> 37:21.614
I should do my worth for this coffee.

37:22.365 --> 37:23.407
But Ga-on.

37:24.825 --> 37:26.494
Leave the background research to me,

37:27.203 --> 37:28.496
and stay back.

37:30.248 --> 37:31.499
-Why?
-Why else?

37:31.582 --> 37:34.043
You went through so much to get here.

37:34.126 --> 37:36.963
Yes, Professor Min is your savior.
I won't deny that.

37:38.005 --> 37:40.383
Still, I think he's gone too far
making you do all these.

37:40.466 --> 37:43.552
A judge is wiretapping calls
and digging around people. What's that?

37:44.971 --> 37:47.640
This isn't just for Professor Min.

37:48.557 --> 37:49.433
Still…

38:19.797 --> 38:20.923
Is this really…

38:22.133 --> 38:23.259
the best you could do?

38:23.843 --> 38:24.969
Yes, sir.

38:25.052 --> 38:28.055
We even poached
the best talents risking lawsuits…

38:29.223 --> 38:30.975
So you're telling me

38:31.058 --> 38:33.561
you even risked lawsuits
to scout the best talents

38:33.644 --> 38:35.396
and whatever for just this?

38:35.479 --> 38:36.731
I'm sorry, sir.

38:36.814 --> 38:38.024
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

38:38.649 --> 38:40.776
Well, I can't taste it.

38:40.860 --> 38:42.903
Those exact flavors
from that store I go to!

38:42.987 --> 38:45.990
Why can't you manage something
so simple splurging on my money?

38:46.073 --> 38:48.576
You think we can dominate
the market like this?

38:49.243 --> 38:51.662
Our opinion is that it's extremely close--

38:51.746 --> 38:54.248
Extremely close?

38:54.874 --> 38:56.167
I told you numerous times

38:56.250 --> 38:59.712
that these cakes are all about detail.
How many times must I say it?

38:59.795 --> 39:01.589
Darn it.

39:04.216 --> 39:06.218
Hey, bring it in.

39:07.261 --> 39:08.304
Here you are, sir.

39:11.098 --> 39:13.434
-Eat.
-Pardon?

39:13.517 --> 39:15.311
I said, eat.

39:15.394 --> 39:18.647
Finish it. Your team came up with it.
Who else should eat it then?

39:18.731 --> 39:22.109
But sir, Director Yoon has diabetes…

39:25.571 --> 39:27.281
Diabetes?

39:28.449 --> 39:29.742
Then leave.

39:29.825 --> 39:31.869
Leave, and starve to death.

39:31.952 --> 39:33.996
No, sir. I'll eat them.

39:47.760 --> 39:50.221
Make sure to shove them all down.

39:52.098 --> 39:53.432
Damn it!

40:05.236 --> 40:07.863
That crazy judge is giving me a headache!

40:08.364 --> 40:10.908
Shit, those imbecile twits.

40:43.607 --> 40:44.900
This isn't mine.

40:51.031 --> 40:52.199
<i>Yes, Vice President.</i>

40:52.283 --> 40:53.242
Well…

40:53.826 --> 40:55.619
Where is Mom?

40:55.703 --> 40:57.705
<i>She's just stepped out of office.</i>

41:06.255 --> 41:08.257
But I can't even tell her this.

41:13.554 --> 41:14.805
Damn it.

41:18.476 --> 41:20.102
Damnit…

41:20.186 --> 41:21.979
Honestly, you…

41:23.355 --> 41:25.566
Hey, why did you have to
slap her like that?

41:25.649 --> 41:29.737
She's given me something drinkable.
I mean, this is just foul.

41:30.446 --> 41:31.572
Hey!

41:34.742 --> 41:36.243
Yes, Vice President.

41:36.327 --> 41:37.661
Come closer.

41:38.871 --> 41:41.373
Closer, come on. A little more. Yes.

41:41.457 --> 41:44.168
Give me something drinkable, damn it.

41:44.251 --> 41:47.421
-How have you been training your staffs?
-I'm sorry, sir.

41:47.505 --> 41:51.008
How can she run out like that?
Making money is easy, right?

41:51.091 --> 41:53.719
No, sir. I'll bring you
another bartender right away.

41:53.802 --> 41:54.678
Save it.

41:55.387 --> 41:57.556
You shove this down your throat.

41:58.933 --> 42:00.726
That just killed my vibe.

42:00.809 --> 42:01.936
Out of my way.

42:03.437 --> 42:05.523
-Have a good night, sir.
-Oh, and…

42:05.606 --> 42:07.483
That girl just now. Fire her.

42:07.983 --> 42:08.817
Yes, sir.

42:09.318 --> 42:10.861
Where are you going?

42:13.364 --> 42:16.492
-Hey, I'm sorry.
-It's okay, sir.

42:42.935 --> 42:46.105
What the hell is it this time?

42:56.657 --> 42:57.783
Hey, open up.

42:59.326 --> 43:00.327
Hey!

43:04.498 --> 43:05.791
What happened to the subway card?

43:08.836 --> 43:11.338
Have you been following me?

43:12.298 --> 43:13.299
Well.

43:17.219 --> 43:20.097
I must be your prey,

43:20.180 --> 43:22.182
but I'm not that easy, you know.

43:22.266 --> 43:24.268
I won't stay put
if you try and mess with me.

43:24.351 --> 43:27.688
So let's not see
each other again, all right?

43:29.023 --> 43:30.566
I better not see you again.

43:38.365 --> 43:39.992
Crazy psycho.

43:48.792 --> 43:50.002
Prey?

43:51.086 --> 43:52.671
You're just bait.

43:54.131 --> 43:55.382
A fresh one at that.

44:02.056 --> 44:04.058
How strange.

44:05.726 --> 44:06.852
What is it?

44:07.436 --> 44:09.980
Our next trial was a case
on an economic crime, remember?

44:10.064 --> 44:11.398
-Yes.
-Judge Kang suggested

44:11.482 --> 44:13.400
that we leave it to the general court

44:14.485 --> 44:15.861
and take this one instead.

44:16.820 --> 44:19.448
And I'd stayed up all night
reviewing it too.

44:20.240 --> 44:22.785
-What case?
-Well, it's about…

44:24.953 --> 44:27.706
A case that's to do
with a measly one million won fine.

44:27.790 --> 44:28.791
One million won?

44:30.584 --> 44:35.005
He's a petty criminal and the prosecution
requested a summary indictment.

44:35.089 --> 44:38.467
He got into a fistfight after a drink.
Simple assault, with no injuries.

44:39.718 --> 44:41.345
Who is it? May I take a look?

44:43.847 --> 44:45.599
He's 28 years old and unemployed.

44:46.308 --> 44:47.976
Nothing much, really.

44:48.060 --> 44:49.603
Since it's a simple case,

44:49.687 --> 44:51.814
the prosecution
requested a summary indictment.

44:51.897 --> 44:56.193
So why is Judge Kang
so hung up on this case?

44:56.985 --> 44:59.488
There's something odd here. Look.

45:00.114 --> 45:03.450
He's a first-time offender, but he's been
called into the station many times.

45:04.034 --> 45:07.121
That means he settled it privately
with the victims each time.

45:07.621 --> 45:08.455
You're right.

45:09.456 --> 45:11.417
So he's an expert on simple assault.

45:11.500 --> 45:13.877
I guess his fist is quite delicate.

45:13.961 --> 45:16.922
How could he assault just enough
to get out of it?

45:18.632 --> 45:21.385
Let's see…

45:23.887 --> 45:25.514
But this time, he didn't settle.

45:27.808 --> 45:30.310
-Maybe this time, he couldn't.
-What?

45:30.394 --> 45:32.896
For example, maybe he couldn't
get a hold of the victim.

45:33.897 --> 45:36.358
It also doesn't make sense
that he's unemployed too.

45:36.442 --> 45:39.236
I mean, all these settlements
must have cost him some money.

45:39.319 --> 45:40.320
You're right.

45:40.404 --> 45:43.449
Then again,
if the police are ready to excuse him…

45:44.324 --> 45:46.577
They don't normally
make a note of his profession.

45:47.911 --> 45:49.204
Right?

45:50.289 --> 45:53.417
Still, at the end of the day,
it's just simple assault.

45:53.500 --> 45:55.294
I mean, we have pride.

45:55.377 --> 45:57.671
So should we, or shouldn't we
take on a case like this?

45:58.338 --> 45:59.506
-No.
-Right?

46:01.175 --> 46:03.343
Honestly, I'm disappointed in Judge Kang.

46:04.136 --> 46:06.138
I didn't know he was the timid type.

46:06.221 --> 46:09.641
How could he lower his tail with just one…

46:11.310 --> 46:13.604
I'm sorry. Let me take this call.

46:17.941 --> 46:19.276
What did you say you found?

46:19.359 --> 46:20.736
<i>Kang Yo-han's traces.</i>

46:20.819 --> 46:21.862
What are you on about?

46:26.325 --> 46:28.869
I went through all the articles
on Kang Yo-han,

46:28.952 --> 46:32.122
and everyone's praising him.
He's almost become some leader of a sect.

46:32.206 --> 46:36.210
Anyway, I saw this one comment
on some online community,

46:37.127 --> 46:38.921
and he claims he knows him quite well.

46:39.004 --> 46:41.924
So I sent him a DM and got his contacts.

46:42.007 --> 46:43.175
Why, what did he write?

46:43.884 --> 46:45.385
<i>"That man, Kang Yo-han…</i>

46:47.471 --> 46:48.430
is a devil."

47:04.696 --> 47:07.032
Judge Kim. What are you doing?

47:09.785 --> 47:11.203
Judge Kang wants to see you.

47:16.959 --> 47:19.586
-Yes.
-Did you call for me, sir?

47:20.087 --> 47:22.714
Hello, Judges.

47:22.798 --> 47:23.799
Hello, Producer.

47:23.882 --> 47:27.302
It's been crazy ever since the first show!

47:27.386 --> 47:28.512
Why?

47:28.595 --> 47:31.014
Well, Judge Kang over there
was famous to start with,

47:31.098 --> 47:33.141
but you two have now taken off too.

47:34.601 --> 47:35.727
-Us two?
-Yes.

47:35.811 --> 47:38.605
When the verdict was being delivered,

47:38.689 --> 47:42.192
your eyes were red with tears
so you wiped them off, didn't you?

47:42.276 --> 47:43.819
That was the highlight of our show!

47:43.902 --> 47:47.239
Everyone was commenting
about how we have a humane judge at last.

47:47.322 --> 47:49.116
Oh, you caught that on camera?

47:49.199 --> 47:52.369
I thought people would criticize me,
so I wiped them off discreetly.

47:52.452 --> 47:55.539
See? I'm telling you
that you have a natural talent for this.

47:56.248 --> 47:57.624
What brings you here today?

47:57.708 --> 47:59.918
And as for Judge Kim,

48:00.002 --> 48:03.630
the girls go crazy about you saying
that you're so cool and awesome.

48:03.714 --> 48:05.090
What brings you here today?

48:05.173 --> 48:06.884
He said he'd like to invite us.

48:06.967 --> 48:08.844
Invite us? To where?

48:12.931 --> 48:14.391
To a charity fashion show

48:14.474 --> 48:17.895
co-hosted by our channel
and the Social Responsibility Foundation.

48:17.978 --> 48:19.897
-A fashion show?
-Yes. You know.

48:19.980 --> 48:23.692
-The circle of people who donate millions.
-Yes, I know them.

48:23.775 --> 48:26.403
Their chairman is super famous.

48:26.486 --> 48:29.531
-A philosopher, right?
-A senator of our nation.

48:30.198 --> 48:32.993
I decline.
Why should a judge attend such an event?

48:36.371 --> 48:39.416
But there's what you call
the social atmosphere.

48:39.499 --> 48:42.336
We need events like this
that instill hope.

48:43.795 --> 48:45.672
If you'd honor us with your presence,

48:45.756 --> 48:47.841
I'm sure that'll cheer up our viewers.

48:47.925 --> 48:51.219
I'd love to go
if it's for a good cause as you say.

48:52.012 --> 48:53.722
But what should I wear?

48:53.805 --> 48:56.183
I don't really have
anything suitable for it.

48:56.266 --> 48:57.893
Leave that to me.

49:00.020 --> 49:00.938
Sorry?

49:01.021 --> 49:02.189
If you don't mind.

49:03.190 --> 49:04.691
I'd love that.

49:05.525 --> 49:06.777
What about you, Judge Kim?

49:07.486 --> 49:08.403
Let's go.

49:11.198 --> 49:13.408
I'm fine, thank you.
I have things to do, anyway.

49:14.326 --> 49:15.994
Fine, as you wish.

49:29.466 --> 49:31.718
I feel like Cinderella.

49:31.802 --> 49:35.347
Even celebs go on a waiting list
to wear something by this designer.

49:35.847 --> 49:36.890
Thank you so much.

49:36.974 --> 49:39.267
I'll be careful with it
and return it in mint condition.

49:39.351 --> 49:41.061
There's no need to.

49:41.144 --> 49:43.271
-What?
-No need to return it.

49:43.355 --> 49:45.273
But this is super expensive.

49:45.857 --> 49:47.776
There's no one else to wear it anyway.

49:48.318 --> 49:49.528
So have fun in it.

49:50.529 --> 49:51.697
Still, how can I…

49:52.280 --> 49:54.241
-Or you can just throw it away.
-What?

49:58.495 --> 49:59.913
<i>A ray of light in darkness!</i>

49:59.997 --> 50:03.333
<i>The red carpet has been laid out</i>
<i>for the charity fashion show</i>

50:03.417 --> 50:06.753
co-hosted by the People Media Group
and the SRF.

50:06.837 --> 50:11.133
Many VIPs have turned up
for tonight's event.

50:16.638 --> 50:19.891
And now…
Oh! I see the man who has the eyes

50:19.975 --> 50:22.853
of the entire nation upon him.
Judge Kang Yo-han

50:22.936 --> 50:24.771
is now making his entrance.

50:32.362 --> 50:33.572
Judge Kang Yo-han!

50:35.741 --> 50:38.827
-Please look this way.
-This way!

50:38.910 --> 50:40.328
You're so awesome.

50:40.412 --> 50:44.041
-Now how about a wave?
-You look great together.

50:48.962 --> 50:52.215
Let's meet with our star judges
of the <i>Live Court Show</i>.

50:52.299 --> 50:55.177
May I ask you to turn to the camera?
Wow, Judge Oh Jin-ju.

50:55.260 --> 50:59.097
I must say, what a transformation!

51:00.015 --> 51:02.684
But is it really all right
for me to be here?

51:02.768 --> 51:04.436
May I ask you to pose?

51:07.439 --> 51:08.982
Please look this way too.

51:09.066 --> 51:10.984
Wow, you are a celebrity already!

51:11.068 --> 51:13.779
I guess we won't need to
worry about Judge Oh.

51:13.862 --> 51:15.864
Let me ask Judge Kang this time.

51:15.947 --> 51:19.451
You have the support of many
of our citizens, as well as their eyes.

51:19.534 --> 51:22.079
So, how about a comment
for all those who are watching?

51:22.162 --> 51:24.122
Thank you
for your support and encouragement.

51:24.706 --> 51:27.793
I am with you in every way.

51:27.876 --> 51:29.920
Whatever wall we come to face,

51:30.003 --> 51:33.548
we'll tackle it head on
for a world where justice lives.

51:33.632 --> 51:35.300
I, for instance,
will fight with all I have.

51:35.801 --> 51:37.886
That was Judge Kang Yo-han.

52:04.996 --> 52:06.039
Take a look around.

52:06.123 --> 52:08.333
-I have to go say hello.
-Hello, Judge Kang.

52:08.416 --> 52:09.334
Yes, hello.

52:11.461 --> 52:12.629
Hello, and welcome.

52:12.712 --> 52:15.507
My name is Jung Seon-a,
and I work for the SRF.

52:15.590 --> 52:17.467
Oh, yes. Hello.

52:17.551 --> 52:19.219
Thank you for joining us in our event.

52:20.554 --> 52:22.556
Gosh, you look
like a greek goddess tonight.

52:22.639 --> 52:26.017
Goddess? Please.
They'll hurl stones at me.

52:26.101 --> 52:28.728
In the <i>Live Court Show</i> I watched,

52:29.229 --> 52:31.064
you were the one who shined the most.

52:33.358 --> 52:34.276
No way.

52:34.901 --> 52:37.654
Why don't you say hello to our chairman?

52:42.450 --> 52:43.660
Director Jung.

52:43.743 --> 52:46.496
Chairman, this is Judge Oh
from the <i>Live Court Show</i>.

52:46.580 --> 52:51.042
-This is Chairman Seo Jeong-hak.
-Hello, it's an honor to meet you.

52:54.796 --> 52:57.132
Not a bad physiognomy, I must say.

52:57.966 --> 52:58.925
She's a judge.

52:59.009 --> 53:00.635
I watched that trial myself too.

53:00.719 --> 53:02.596
In these turbulent times,

53:03.638 --> 53:05.265
the rule by law prevails.

53:05.348 --> 53:06.766
But that's only short-lived.

53:07.392 --> 53:10.353
In the end, it is virtue and benevolence

53:10.437 --> 53:12.981
that tames the people.

53:14.941 --> 53:17.903
I will remember that, Chairman.

53:17.986 --> 53:19.196
You'll do well.

53:38.381 --> 53:40.926
Yo-han was very different
from the other children.

53:41.843 --> 53:43.595
Ever since his first day at school.

53:44.721 --> 53:46.348
Different? How?

53:48.141 --> 53:50.936
KANG YO-HAN

53:54.481 --> 53:55.565
<i>His face was gloomy,</i>

53:57.692 --> 53:58.860
and he kept to himself.

54:00.487 --> 54:02.197
Is there anything you'd like to say?

54:02.280 --> 54:04.658
I'm sure your friends would like
to know more about you.

54:11.706 --> 54:14.292
All right, then.
Who wants Yo-han to sit next to them?

54:21.549 --> 54:24.135
Se-in, how about you?

54:24.219 --> 54:26.012
Sure, Miss.

54:30.475 --> 54:33.019
This time, we'll calculate
the perimeter of a rectangle.

54:33.103 --> 54:35.480
Pay attention and write it down.

54:35.981 --> 54:39.943
First, let's add the width
of this side and the other side,

54:40.026 --> 54:42.904
and the height of this side and this side.

54:42.988 --> 54:44.322
-Second…
-Hey, it's a bird!

54:44.406 --> 54:46.324
After that, add them and…

54:46.408 --> 54:47.867
Quiet, guys.

54:55.667 --> 54:57.168
Guys, be quiet!

54:58.670 --> 54:59.796
Be quiet, and sit down.

55:02.507 --> 55:03.383
Guys!

55:09.139 --> 55:11.057
Are you crazy? Why did you kill it?

55:11.141 --> 55:12.475
What did you just do?

55:12.559 --> 55:15.687
-Did you just see that?
-Are you crazy? What was that?

55:17.647 --> 55:18.648
What…

55:18.732 --> 55:21.067
Why did you kill it?

55:29.075 --> 55:32.829
Ever since then,
the children called him a monster.

55:33.413 --> 55:34.497
Nobody talked to him.

55:35.957 --> 55:38.168
<i>They treated him as if he were invisible.</i>

55:43.757 --> 55:45.008
I see.

55:46.301 --> 55:48.053
Is that why you left such a comment?

55:48.136 --> 55:50.096
-That he's a devil?
-No.

55:50.764 --> 55:55.101
That was nothing compared to
what would happen much later.

55:56.311 --> 55:58.897
<i>At that time, our school</i>
<i>saw two groups of students,</i>

55:58.980 --> 56:01.358
<i>children from uptown</i>
<i>and children from downtown.</i>

56:01.941 --> 56:05.779
<i>The children from uptown were affluent,</i>
<i>and the children from downtown were poor.</i>

56:06.946 --> 56:08.865
<i>Still, they shared something in common.</i>

56:08.948 --> 56:11.701
In that they treated Yo-han
as if he were a monster.

56:11.785 --> 56:13.495
You should get his head. His head!

56:19.959 --> 56:22.921
Hey, let's get his eyes next time.

56:26.007 --> 56:27.050
Nice one!

56:31.888 --> 56:34.182
Hey, did you see his face?

56:35.975 --> 56:38.812
That looks exactly like him!

56:45.235 --> 56:46.319
Minister.

56:48.863 --> 56:50.573
Congratulations, Judge Kang.

56:50.657 --> 56:52.033
Thank you for coming.

56:52.117 --> 56:55.161
You have shown
that justice still lives on this land.

56:55.245 --> 56:56.996
It was very commendable.

56:57.080 --> 56:58.206
Thank you.

56:58.998 --> 57:00.959
I must say
I was a little startled, however.

57:01.042 --> 57:03.461
-Please.
-Could you pose for us?

57:09.217 --> 57:10.760
So, will you do that again?

57:11.928 --> 57:13.263
No way.

57:14.180 --> 57:15.807
-This way, please.
-Okay.

57:17.767 --> 57:19.185
Ladies and gentlemen,

57:19.686 --> 57:23.857
we have a special event
planned for this evening.

57:36.411 --> 57:37.745
I think it's begun already.

57:38.455 --> 57:39.789
Well, have fun.

57:39.873 --> 57:42.333
-Sure, I will see you later.
-Yes.

57:46.045 --> 57:48.965
The people and virtue…

57:49.048 --> 57:50.550
It's been a while, Chairman.

57:51.301 --> 57:52.218
Please excuse me.

58:17.452 --> 58:20.205
Hold my hand like this,
and place your thumb here.

58:20.788 --> 58:22.248
As for this hand…

58:22.832 --> 58:23.917
Yes, that's right.

58:34.052 --> 58:35.386
You're doing great.

58:38.223 --> 58:40.475
May I?

58:42.894 --> 58:43.770
Director Jung.

59:17.053 --> 59:18.179
<i>Then one day…</i>

59:19.013 --> 59:20.890
that happened.

59:20.974 --> 59:22.684
Where did it go?

59:28.731 --> 59:31.317
Hey, have you seen my pencil case?

59:31.901 --> 59:32.819
I wouldn't know.

59:34.028 --> 59:36.072
My dad bought it for me from the States.

59:36.155 --> 59:37.448
Where did it go?

59:39.826 --> 59:42.370
<i>We didn't think much of it at first.</i>

59:42.453 --> 59:45.790
But what triggered it was
that the children from downtown

59:45.873 --> 59:48.376
and the children from uptown
were often paired up.

59:48.459 --> 59:51.129
I guess the teachers
wanted them to all get along.

59:53.673 --> 59:55.049
What is it?

59:59.053 --> 1:00:01.180
Why are you looking at me?

1:00:04.517 --> 1:00:05.476
Why are you crying?

1:00:05.560 --> 1:00:08.605
<i>Soon, only the uptown children</i>
<i>who were paired up</i>

1:00:08.688 --> 1:00:12.358
<i>with the downtown children started</i>
<i>to see their belongings go missing.</i>

1:00:12.442 --> 1:00:14.319
That's right, I got new shoes!

1:00:16.904 --> 1:00:19.240
-Ta-da!
-Wow!

1:00:19.324 --> 1:00:21.409
Wait. It's got a tear.

1:00:23.911 --> 1:00:25.288
Darn it.

1:00:30.335 --> 1:00:32.462
Hey! You did this, didn't you?

1:00:32.545 --> 1:00:34.505
-It wasn't me.
-Don't lie.

1:00:34.589 --> 1:00:35.840
It really wasn't me!

1:00:35.923 --> 1:00:37.592
But you sit next to him.

1:00:37.675 --> 1:00:39.677
That doesn't mean I did that.

1:00:39.761 --> 1:00:42.096
And then, that day finally arrived.

1:00:43.514 --> 1:00:46.184
I enjoyed your first trial, Judge Kang.

1:00:48.770 --> 1:00:49.771
Did you enjoy it?

1:00:49.854 --> 1:00:51.981
Did I enjoy it?

1:00:52.482 --> 1:00:55.610
You got the genre wrong.
I found it very touching.

1:00:55.693 --> 1:00:57.362
I even teared up a bit.

1:00:58.279 --> 1:01:01.115
I'm glad you found it
to your liking, Director Jung.

1:01:05.912 --> 1:01:07.872
But you know what?

1:01:07.955 --> 1:01:11.042
What our benefactors hate the most

1:01:11.125 --> 1:01:12.669
is a story with a twist.

1:01:21.094 --> 1:01:23.054
You know the old weasels.

1:01:23.888 --> 1:01:27.600
They like cliches.
Stories that are predictable.

1:01:27.684 --> 1:01:29.060
The more they have, that is.

1:01:29.143 --> 1:01:33.314
We can't cater to
everyone's preferences, can we?

1:01:41.989 --> 1:01:45.076
A man who has all the fun
by himself is not so charming.

1:01:47.161 --> 1:01:49.247
And pretty useless too.

1:01:56.170 --> 1:01:57.839
I'm disappointed to hear that.

1:01:58.589 --> 1:01:59.841
Because I'm…

1:02:01.008 --> 1:02:02.677
having so much fun right now.

1:02:04.637 --> 1:02:07.181
Where did it go?
Where is my gaming device?

1:02:10.101 --> 1:02:13.187
-Why are you looking at me?
-Hey, let me take a look in your bag.

1:02:13.271 --> 1:02:14.313
Why?

1:02:14.397 --> 1:02:15.898
I said, let me see.

1:02:16.607 --> 1:02:19.861
Give it!

1:02:19.944 --> 1:02:21.487
-I said, give it!
-Let go!

1:02:22.447 --> 1:02:25.867
It wasn't me. It really wasn't me.

1:02:27.535 --> 1:02:30.163
This is why I didn't want
to sit next to beggars.

1:02:30.246 --> 1:02:32.915
Hey, you put this in my bag,
didn't you? On purpose?

1:02:32.999 --> 1:02:35.334
-Let me see your bag too.
-I said, it's not me!

1:03:08.826 --> 1:03:09.911
Judge Kang.

1:03:16.250 --> 1:03:20.213
My family is here too. Why not say hello?

1:03:20.296 --> 1:03:22.006
-Honey.
-Yes?

1:03:23.299 --> 1:03:25.760
Goodness, Judge Kang.

1:03:25.843 --> 1:03:28.262
Good to see you here,
President Lee Jae-kyeong.

1:03:28.346 --> 1:03:31.724
My son's here too. Yeong-min!

1:03:31.808 --> 1:03:33.684
Come say hello.

1:03:43.486 --> 1:03:44.570
What?

1:03:47.365 --> 1:03:50.409
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Vice President Lee Yeong-min.

1:04:46.924 --> 1:04:49.635
<i>That child was a devil.</i>

1:05:10.781 --> 1:05:12.199
<i>My late father</i>

1:05:12.909 --> 1:05:13.784
was a loan shark.

1:05:15.119 --> 1:05:17.496
<i>Second-generation, and quite notorious.</i>

1:05:18.956 --> 1:05:20.416
<i>Ever since then,</i>

1:05:20.499 --> 1:05:22.835
<i>the children called him a monster.</i>

1:05:22.919 --> 1:05:25.880
Why? Can't you imagine me
growing up under such a man?

1:05:34.513 --> 1:05:35.598
Chairman Seo.

1:05:36.849 --> 1:05:38.017
Yes.

1:05:42.939 --> 1:05:45.441
Maybe he hasn't been fully tamed.

1:06:05.920 --> 1:06:07.505
Are you looking for this?

1:06:20.101 --> 1:06:21.352
So you knew it.

1:06:32.905 --> 1:06:34.615
Why are you doing this?

1:06:35.992 --> 1:06:37.576
Why am I doing this?

1:06:38.202 --> 1:06:39.078
Yes.

1:06:39.996 --> 1:06:41.789
-Because I can.
-Pardon?

1:06:42.957 --> 1:06:44.834
The possibility is like ecstasy.

1:06:54.927 --> 1:06:55.886
Step back!

1:08:05.456 --> 1:08:07.750
THANKS TO JUNG JAE-SUNG,
JOO SEOK-TAE, AND PARK HYUNG-SOO

1:08:07.833 --> 1:08:09.001
FOR THEIR SPECIAL APPEARANCE

1:08:31.941 --> 1:08:34.860
<i>You, my fellow Koreans, are the only ones</i>

1:08:34.944 --> 1:08:36.487
<i>who can protect us.</i>

1:08:38.197 --> 1:08:39.031
This was why.

1:08:39.115 --> 1:08:41.617
There are those
who fail to understand the warnings

1:08:41.700 --> 1:08:43.285
and regret it later.

1:08:43.369 --> 1:08:44.995
<i>The bomb exploded from the wall painting.</i>

1:08:45.079 --> 1:08:46.956
<i>Maybe it was pre-installed</i>
<i>in the painting?</i>

1:08:47.039 --> 1:08:48.958
We need to get to them before the police.

1:08:49.041 --> 1:08:51.377
The same goes for me. No hard feelings.

1:08:51.460 --> 1:08:53.879
Go tell your master
that they better come see me themselves.

1:08:53.963 --> 1:08:56.966
Looks like we'll need to meet, Judge Kang.

1:08:57.049 --> 1:08:59.343
<i>It's Kang Yo-han whom I'm suspecting.</i>

1:09:00.302 --> 1:09:05.099
