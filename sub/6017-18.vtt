00:04.070 --> 00:06.664
As humans, we need training
in social skills...

00:06.840 --> 00:08.068
...conversational distance.

00:08.241 --> 00:10.709
Don't you hate these people
that talk into your mouth...

00:10.877 --> 00:13.072
...like you're a clown
at a drive-through?

00:13.246 --> 00:14.543
And handshakes is the worst.

00:14.714 --> 00:17.239
There's absolutely no guidelines
for handshakes.

00:17.417 --> 00:19.544
You know how many people...?
Too strong, too weak.

00:19.719 --> 00:20.947
Sometimes they give you...

00:21.121 --> 00:23.248
...the three-quarter handshake,
just the fingers.

00:23.423 --> 00:24.981
Early release, late release.

00:25.158 --> 00:27.718
Sometimes people
will dispute your release.

00:27.894 --> 00:30.385
You've let go. They're hanging on.

00:30.563 --> 00:34.294
I have actually said to people,
"Hey, the handshake is over."

00:35.702 --> 00:38.136
Too many pumps,
coming in too high...

00:38.304 --> 00:41.705
...too sweaty, from too far away.

00:41.875 --> 00:44.810
Sometimes a guy will give you
a strong grip, late release...

00:44.978 --> 00:47.310
...and pull you in for the
too-close conversation.

00:47.981 --> 00:51.246
To him I say,
"That's three strikes. You're out."

00:57.223 --> 00:59.088
You know, the timing
couldn't be worse.

00:59.292 --> 01:01.817
Is there a good time to have
your parents stay with you?

01:01.995 --> 01:04.896
I haven't been together
with Rachel for three weeks.

01:05.165 --> 01:07.861
First I was on the road,
then my parents show up.

01:08.034 --> 01:10.161
I'm getting a little backed up.

01:12.238 --> 01:14.763
- When are they leaving for Paris?
- Not for three days.

01:14.941 --> 01:17.466
- What about her place?
- She lives with her parents.

01:17.644 --> 01:18.941
Really?

01:19.112 --> 01:22.673
Maybe this will become, like,
a cool thing, living with your parents.

01:22.849 --> 01:24.646
Then maybe baldness
will catch on.

01:26.319 --> 01:28.446
Things will all be turning your way.

01:29.656 --> 01:32.284
Hey, believe me,
baldness will catch on.

01:32.492 --> 01:35.655
When the aliens come, who do
you think they're gonna relate to?

01:35.829 --> 01:38.195
Who do you think's gonna be
getting tour of the ship?

01:38.364 --> 01:40.059
The baldies.

01:40.233 --> 01:42.667
My parents want your parents
over for dinner.

01:42.836 --> 01:45.134
Good. I get the apartment
for at least one night.

01:45.305 --> 01:48.297
I'm paying for this Paris trip.
It's their anniversary present.

01:49.442 --> 01:51.034
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Alec.

01:51.211 --> 01:52.701
- Hey, Alec.
- This is Joey.

01:52.879 --> 01:55.211
- Hey, Joey, how are you doing?
- Hey, listen...

01:55.381 --> 01:58.214
...I was wondering if you'd be
interested in doing some work...

01:58.384 --> 02:01.683
...for the Big Brother program.
I'm kind of running the local chapter.

02:02.589 --> 02:04.580
What do you say, George?

02:04.824 --> 02:06.849
- Well...
- Wouldn't you...

02:07.026 --> 02:10.257
...like to be a Big Brother
to someone like me?

02:10.430 --> 02:12.398
Please?

02:12.599 --> 02:14.226
Well...

02:14.467 --> 02:16.935
...sure, Joey, sure.

02:17.170 --> 02:19.570
I would be thrilled.

02:19.739 --> 02:22.037
That's great. Thanks.
I'll get in touch with you.

02:22.208 --> 02:24.005
Wouldn't you like to be
a Big Brother...?

02:24.177 --> 02:25.644
All right, Joey. That's enough.

02:25.812 --> 02:27.211
Let's go. See you.

02:28.314 --> 02:30.282
- What happened?
- What could I do?

02:30.450 --> 02:32.475
Did you see the mug on that kid?

02:33.086 --> 02:36.954
Wouldn't you like to pass the ketchup
to someone like me?

02:37.690 --> 02:39.157
Please?

02:39.659 --> 02:40.990
Have you noticed they moved...

02:41.161 --> 02:42.958
...where they do the interview
on <i>Jeopardy</i> ?

02:43.129 --> 02:45.188
Yeah. It was in the middle
of Single Jeopardy.

02:45.365 --> 02:48.357
- Now it's after Single Jeopardy.
- Yeah. It's much better, isn't it?

02:48.535 --> 02:49.832
Oh, no comparison.

02:50.003 --> 02:52.904
I gotta get my parents one
of those French-English dictionaries.

02:54.007 --> 02:56.373
- Hey, hey, hey.
- What?

02:57.043 --> 02:58.738
Your parents are going
to Paris, right?

02:58.912 --> 03:01.244
- Yeah.
- So I tell Alec...

03:01.414 --> 03:04.440
...that I have to go to Paris
for an undetermined amount of time.

03:04.651 --> 03:06.585
Then all I have to do
is buy postcards...

03:06.753 --> 03:09.278
...and have your parents
mail them from Paris.

03:09.455 --> 03:11.923
- What about little Joey?
- Who?

03:12.458 --> 03:14.926
- He's probably better off.
- Yeah.

03:16.029 --> 03:18.224
I'm trying to get out
of this Big Brother program.

03:18.398 --> 03:21.128
When you get to Paris,
drop them in any mailbox.

03:21.301 --> 03:25.260
- But there are no stamps on these.
- You gotta buy French stamps.

03:25.471 --> 03:27.837
I'll reimburse you, of course.

03:28.041 --> 03:29.372
Why are you doing this?

03:29.542 --> 03:31.339
He wants this guy
to think he's in Paris.

03:31.511 --> 03:32.739
- Why?
- Because George...

03:32.912 --> 03:34.743
...is a deeply disturbed individual.

03:35.949 --> 03:40.352
Oh, hey, Helen. Could I use
some more of your hand lotion?

03:40.520 --> 03:44.479
I told you it was good. It's from
the Saks Fifth Avenue in Miami.

03:45.258 --> 03:47.419
I'll remember that
if I'm ever in Florida.

03:47.594 --> 03:50.119
Yeah, or if ever on Fifth Avenue
here in New York City.

03:50.296 --> 03:51.991
- You can get some there.
- Yeah?

03:52.165 --> 03:55.259
Say, those are nice pants.
I got a pair just like them at home.

03:55.435 --> 03:57.699
That doesn't surprise me.
I bought these at Rudy's.

03:57.870 --> 04:01.601
It's a used clothing store.
See, when people like you die...

04:01.774 --> 04:04.208
...the widows,
they bring in their wardrobes.

04:04.410 --> 04:07.470
- They make a bundle.
- Really?

04:07.714 --> 04:10.683
My father's got a ton of old clothes
just sitting up in the attic.

04:10.850 --> 04:13.318
- You think they're worth something?
- lf they're vintage.

04:13.486 --> 04:14.919
And you're a widow.

04:15.121 --> 04:17.918
What happens if the husband dies
after the wife?

04:18.091 --> 04:21.527
- Who brings the clothing in then?
- I suppose the children do.

04:22.495 --> 04:24.963
Yes, I suppose they do.

04:26.266 --> 04:28.791
All right. I got a 10:00.
I'll see everybody later.

04:39.078 --> 04:40.375
Hey, I just remembered...

04:40.546 --> 04:43.515
...my parents wanna have you
over for dinner before you leave.

04:43.683 --> 04:45.674
- What about tonight?
- Tonight?

04:45.852 --> 04:47.649
Yeah. They're making paella.

04:48.321 --> 04:50.881
I don't think we can make it tonight.
We have plans.

04:51.057 --> 04:53.617
- What plans?
- We have plans.

04:54.193 --> 04:56.787
- Where did you get plans?
- We have plans.

04:57.196 --> 05:00.825
- Well, what about tomorrow night?
- Maybe.

05:02.835 --> 05:04.769
Okay...

05:04.971 --> 05:06.666
...I guess I'll tell them that.
- Okay.

05:07.240 --> 05:09.174
- Hey, give them our best, though.
- Yeah.

05:09.342 --> 05:11.310
- I'll call you later.
- Yeah.

05:16.149 --> 05:18.344
- So, what plans do you have?
- None.

05:18.518 --> 05:20.884
So how come you're not
going over there for dinner?

05:21.054 --> 05:24.148
Jerry, we don't care much
for the Costanzas.

05:24.324 --> 05:26.588
We can't stand them.

05:27.393 --> 05:29.793
- Really? Since when?
- Since always.

05:29.962 --> 05:32.226
- We've never liked them.
- Why?

05:32.398 --> 05:34.457
Well, they're so loud.
They're always fighting.

05:34.634 --> 05:36.295
It's uncomfortable.
You never noticed?

05:36.469 --> 05:38.334
I noticed. But they're
from your age group.

05:38.504 --> 05:40.028
I didn't think you could detect...

05:40.206 --> 05:42.106
...abnormal behavior
among your own kind.

05:42.275 --> 05:43.606
Well, we do.

05:46.212 --> 05:49.443
- Yeah?
- <i>It's us.</i>

05:49.615 --> 05:51.412
Oh, come on up.

05:52.552 --> 05:55.521
- It's Elaine. You have any problem?
- We adore Elaine.

05:55.688 --> 05:58.054
- She's with her new boyfriend.
- What's he like?

05:58.224 --> 06:00.784
- He's nice. A bit of a close talker.
- A what?

06:00.960 --> 06:03.224
You'll see.

06:03.396 --> 06:06.456
I really had no idea that you felt
this way about the Costanzas.

06:06.632 --> 06:09.795
They're exhausting.
It's like being in an asylum.

06:10.636 --> 06:12.433
- Hi.
- Hi.

06:12.605 --> 06:14.129
- There she is.
- Hello, Elaine.

06:14.307 --> 06:16.639
Hi, Mrs. Seinfeld.

06:16.809 --> 06:18.640
Oh, this is Aaron.

06:18.811 --> 06:20.472
- Hello, Aaron.
- Hello.

06:20.646 --> 06:22.443
How long are you folks in town?

06:24.117 --> 06:28.144
Three more days. Three more days,
and then we're off to Paris.

06:28.321 --> 06:30.619
We're going with a select
charter group.

06:30.790 --> 06:33.315
I love France.
I was just there last year.

06:33.493 --> 06:34.858
In fact...

06:35.128 --> 06:38.393
...you know, I still have
an envelope full of French francs.

06:38.598 --> 06:40.190
I'll give them to you.

06:40.566 --> 06:41.999
We can't take money.

06:42.168 --> 06:45.069
No. It's a gift. From us.

06:45.238 --> 06:48.730
Oh, that is so nice, Aaron.

06:48.908 --> 06:50.341
Isn't he nice?

06:50.510 --> 06:52.569
Has Jerry been
showing you a good time?

06:52.745 --> 06:54.474
No, I haven't.

06:54.647 --> 06:56.672
You know, I have a friend...

06:56.849 --> 07:00.182
...who works at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art.

07:00.386 --> 07:02.217
How'd you like
a behind-the-scenes tour?

07:02.388 --> 07:05.687
- Really? You could do that?
- Easily.

07:05.858 --> 07:07.792
- It wouldn't be any trouble?
- Of course not.

07:07.960 --> 07:10.360
- When could we go?
- How about right now?

07:10.530 --> 07:12.293
- I'm ready.
- Are you sure?

07:12.465 --> 07:14.695
- Yes!
- Okay, let me get my coat.

07:14.867 --> 07:17.028
Elaine, what do you say?

07:17.203 --> 07:19.433
Well, I don't think so, Aaron.

07:20.473 --> 07:22.065
I have plans.

07:23.576 --> 07:25.271
How about you, Jerry?

07:25.445 --> 07:27.106
I'm swamped.

07:27.280 --> 07:30.772
You sure? You can examine
the artwork up close.

07:31.050 --> 07:32.711
Maybe I'll try and catch up with you.

07:33.519 --> 07:35.384
Yeah, that will happen.

07:35.688 --> 07:37.019
All right. We're off.

07:37.190 --> 07:38.452
- Okay. Bye.
- Let's go.

07:38.624 --> 07:40.353
Okay. Bye-bye.
Have a good time.

07:40.526 --> 07:41.754
- Bye.
- See everybody later.

07:41.928 --> 07:43.862
- Okay.
- Bye.

07:44.030 --> 07:46.692
Why would he ask your parents
to go to a museum?

07:46.866 --> 07:48.458
- I don't know.
- What is that?

07:48.634 --> 07:50.534
Maybe he was just trying
to be nice.

07:50.703 --> 07:53.365
Have you ever heard of anyone
doing anything like this?

07:53.539 --> 07:56.599
Wait a second.
He just did me a big favor.

07:56.776 --> 07:59.006
- What?
- He got them out of the house.

07:59.178 --> 08:01.169
- What?
- I can call Rachel.

08:01.747 --> 08:03.510
Oh, no. I got the machine.

08:03.783 --> 08:06.616
Rachel are you there? I got
the place to myself for a few hours.

08:06.786 --> 08:08.913
Rachel, where are you?

08:09.121 --> 08:11.055
Rachel!

08:12.492 --> 08:15.893
Sorry, pal. Wish I could
help you out.

08:18.764 --> 08:21.198
- They're not coming?
- No. They had plans.

08:21.367 --> 08:22.595
How could they have plans?

08:22.768 --> 08:24.326
What difference does it make?

08:24.504 --> 08:25.732
They wouldn't lie to us.

08:25.905 --> 08:28.339
- They're our dear friends.
- What am I supposed to do...

08:28.508 --> 08:30.840
...with all this paella?
- They said tomorrow, maybe.

08:31.010 --> 08:33.034
- Maybe?
- Maybe they don't like us.

08:33.212 --> 08:35.145
Why wouldn't they like us?

08:37.616 --> 08:40.552
Again with the pepper? What do
you gotta use all that pepper for?

08:40.720 --> 08:43.917
- Keep quiet.
- You trying to set my mouth on fire?

08:44.957 --> 08:47.084
I don't know what
the reason could be.

08:52.031 --> 08:53.760
- Hello.
- Oh, hi.

08:53.933 --> 08:55.264
What a day.

08:55.468 --> 08:58.403
Jerry, you would not believe
the time we had.

08:58.571 --> 09:00.198
Aaron is quite the tour guide.

09:00.373 --> 09:02.739
Have you ever seen
those lmpressionist paintings?

09:02.909 --> 09:05.969
- Oh, sure, like Monet.
- Don't you think he had to be...

09:06.145 --> 09:08.943
...nearsighted? Nobody would
paint like that if they could see.

09:09.115 --> 09:10.605
It's all out of focus.

09:10.783 --> 09:12.842
He's from the lmpressionist school,
you know...

09:13.019 --> 09:15.988
...like Monet, Manet,
Tippy-tippy-day-day.

09:16.155 --> 09:18.885
I say that guy was painting
without his glasses.

09:21.127 --> 09:23.857
Hello. Rachel.

09:24.630 --> 09:25.961
Yeah.

09:27.266 --> 09:29.291
No. They're back.

09:30.436 --> 09:34.133
Jerry if you have something to do,
we can just sit right here and read.

09:34.307 --> 09:36.434
Yes. Well...

09:36.609 --> 09:38.941
...l'm sorry too.
Listen, I'll call you later.

09:39.345 --> 09:40.903
Okay. Bye.

09:41.080 --> 09:42.604
Well, I should be going.

09:42.782 --> 09:44.579
Oh, thanks again.

09:44.750 --> 09:46.047
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

09:46.218 --> 09:49.016
- Hey.
- Oh, you must be Kramer.

09:49.188 --> 09:51.122
I've heard about you.

09:55.828 --> 09:57.853
Hey, you must be Aaron.
I've heard about you.

10:00.132 --> 10:01.690
- Well, see you later.
- Yeah.

10:02.501 --> 10:04.196
- Bye.
- Okay.

10:05.905 --> 10:07.702
So, what are you guys
doing for dinner?

10:07.873 --> 10:10.341
- We have no plans.
- Look at that, Helen.

10:10.509 --> 10:13.103
Do you see what he's wearing?
That's the Executive.

10:13.279 --> 10:15.611
- What is the Executive?
- The beltless trench coat.

10:15.781 --> 10:17.715
- My father invented it.
- I sure did.

10:17.883 --> 10:20.977
Raincoats were my business.
The Executive was a classic.

10:21.153 --> 10:23.144
These haven't been made
in 20 years.

10:23.322 --> 10:25.290
Why would they?
Nobody bought them then.

10:26.092 --> 10:29.186
- He's wearing one.
- These are a hot item at Rudy's.

10:29.362 --> 10:30.852
You don't say.

10:31.063 --> 10:34.430
You know, I have boxes of those
sitting in my garage in Florida.

10:34.634 --> 10:35.862
Get them up here.

10:36.068 --> 10:38.730
You give me 25 percent,
I'll take care of everything.

10:38.904 --> 10:41.134
- You got a deal.
- Yeah.

10:42.842 --> 10:45.037
This is like the meeting
of Smith and Wesson.

10:45.978 --> 10:48.674
I'll call Jack Klompus.
He's got a key to the garage.

10:48.848 --> 10:52.579
- He can send them overnight delivery.
- You're gonna start shipping boxes?

10:52.752 --> 10:56.085
- We're leaving for Paris in three days.
- He'll send them express.

10:56.255 --> 10:58.985
- You're crazy.
- I'll tell you how crazy I am.

10:59.158 --> 11:01.023
I'm paying for this trip
with these coats.

11:01.193 --> 11:03.753
- I'm paying for the trip.
- So much the better.

11:07.099 --> 11:09.465
Anyway, it's kind of a fluke thing...

11:09.635 --> 11:12.627
...but I'll be leaving for Paris
in two days.

11:13.806 --> 11:16.934
I will send you a postcard
when I get there.

11:17.610 --> 11:18.941
- Paris, huh?
- Yeah.

11:19.111 --> 11:23.138
You know, I feel terrible about Joey,
but it's a great business opportunity.

11:23.315 --> 11:25.545
I don't even know how long
I'm gonna be away.

11:25.951 --> 11:27.885
Where will you stay?

11:28.120 --> 11:30.213
An apartment complex. The...

11:30.656 --> 11:32.556
The Eiffel Towers.

11:33.826 --> 11:37.660
Like I said, you'll be getting
a postcard in a few days...

11:37.830 --> 11:39.525
...and again, I'm sorry.

11:40.833 --> 11:44.269
George, you have no idea
how fantastic this is.

11:44.737 --> 11:46.227
- Fantastic?
- Yeah.

11:46.639 --> 11:49.164
We've been trying to reunite
Joey with his father...

11:49.375 --> 11:50.603
...who lives in Paris.

11:51.877 --> 11:55.005
But he's afraid to fly alone.
You know, he's kind of withdrawn...

11:55.214 --> 11:57.944
...but he seems to take to you.

11:58.317 --> 12:02.617
- So it's a perfect solution.
- Gee, what a coincidence.

12:04.156 --> 12:06.147
And you'll send me a postcard.

12:09.028 --> 12:11.792
Helen really seemed
to respond to Renoir.

12:12.298 --> 12:15.665
I think she really connected
with the way he painted children.

12:16.736 --> 12:18.397
And that Morty.

12:18.838 --> 12:21.705
I'll tell you, that old guy's full of life.

12:23.175 --> 12:26.542
He was convinced
Monet was nearsighted.

12:27.246 --> 12:29.373
- I kept telling him...
- Aaron?

12:30.449 --> 12:31.814
Yes?

12:32.518 --> 12:34.611
Let me ask you a question.

12:35.054 --> 12:37.215
How come you asked
Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld...

12:37.389 --> 12:38.822
...to go to the museum with you?

12:39.158 --> 12:43.527
Well, they were in from out of town.
I thought they'd enjoy it.

12:47.099 --> 12:48.623
You didn't feel uncomfortable...

12:48.801 --> 12:51.167
...spending the whole
day at the museum...

12:51.337 --> 12:54.170
...with two complete strangers
who are more than twice your age?

12:54.340 --> 12:55.830
No.

12:56.575 --> 12:58.338
It was fun.

12:59.011 --> 13:02.538
You had fun
with Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld?

13:02.715 --> 13:04.046
Yeah.

13:05.551 --> 13:07.075
They bought me a Coke.

13:11.157 --> 13:13.557
How'd you get the idea
for the beltless trench coat?

13:13.726 --> 13:17.253
I came home one night,
and I tripped over one of Jerry's toys.

13:18.364 --> 13:21.299
So I took out my belt,
just to threaten him...

13:21.500 --> 13:24.492
...and I got a glimpse
of myself in the mirror.

13:26.338 --> 13:29.398
- How serendipitous.
- So that night, I cut off the loops...

13:29.909 --> 13:32.207
...and the Executive was born.

13:32.378 --> 13:35.279
He also had an idea
for a brimless rain hat...

13:35.447 --> 13:37.381
...but that never materialized.

13:37.550 --> 13:39.074
All right, come on. Let's play.

13:39.251 --> 13:42.015
- Did you call Jack Klompus?
- I haven't been able to reach him.

13:42.188 --> 13:43.416
I'll call him right now.

13:43.589 --> 13:45.113
- Oh, come on.
- Just a second.

13:45.324 --> 13:47.485
Jerry, have you seen
<i>Schindler's List</i> ?

13:47.660 --> 13:49.594
- No, I haven't seen it yet.
- You have to go.

13:49.762 --> 13:51.059
- I'm going.
- You have to.

13:51.230 --> 13:52.527
Okay.

13:53.599 --> 13:55.328
- Hello, Jack?
- <i>Yeah?</i>

13:55.501 --> 13:57.435
- Jack, it's Morty.
- Who died?

13:59.071 --> 14:02.507
Nobody died. Jack, I want you
to do me a big favor.

14:03.108 --> 14:06.168
- In my garage are a couple of boxes.
- What boxes?

14:06.412 --> 14:10.041
- I'm gonna explain what boxes.
- All right. How the hell do I know?

14:10.249 --> 14:12.183
Anyway, there are
these three big boxes...

14:12.351 --> 14:15.252
...you can't miss them, I want you
to ship them here to New York.

14:15.421 --> 14:17.048
I thought you were going to Paris.

14:17.223 --> 14:18.713
I'm still going to Paris.

14:18.891 --> 14:20.688
I got a big deal cooking here.

14:20.993 --> 14:23.393
- What's in the boxes?
- Raincoats.

14:23.562 --> 14:24.824
Raincoats?

14:24.997 --> 14:28.023
You think you're gonna sell
those old crappy raincoats?

14:28.200 --> 14:29.428
That's garbage.

14:29.602 --> 14:32.765
I guarantee you, Doris won't let him
mail those boxes.

14:32.938 --> 14:35.304
- When do you want these?
- Send them tomorrow.

14:37.142 --> 14:39.508
So you think
they're coming tonight?

14:39.712 --> 14:41.612
I don't know. They said maybe.

14:41.814 --> 14:43.941
Of course they're coming.
They're leaving soon.

14:44.116 --> 14:47.051
- lf they don't come, they won't see us.
- Well, they better come.

14:47.253 --> 14:48.811
I got all this paella.

14:49.722 --> 14:53.715
I admire Morty and Helen
going to France.

14:53.926 --> 14:55.655
We should take a trip.

14:56.161 --> 14:57.492
Maybe a cruise.

14:58.330 --> 14:59.627
Yes, a cruise.

14:59.832 --> 15:01.629
A long cruise.

15:01.834 --> 15:03.062
Just the two of you.

15:03.235 --> 15:06.898
Georgie, what were you doing
poking around the attic last night?

15:10.242 --> 15:12.938
- I wasn't in the attic.
- I heard noise.

15:14.213 --> 15:17.478
- Maybe it was a mouse.
- Okay, that's it! We're moving!

15:17.683 --> 15:21.642
- What?
- I will not tolerate infestation.

15:22.254 --> 15:23.846
You haven't even seen one.

15:24.023 --> 15:27.049
Don't you understand?
The very thought, the very idea.

15:27.226 --> 15:28.955
I'll never be comfortable again.

15:29.128 --> 15:30.857
All right, Frank. That's enough.

15:37.670 --> 15:40.696
I guess I've been hanging
onto them for so long...

15:41.640 --> 15:45.337
...because I couldn't accept the fact
that Dad was really gone forever.

15:47.980 --> 15:50.073
They will get a good home,
won't they?

15:50.249 --> 15:52.717
I gotta be honest, there's nothing
here too spectacular.

15:52.885 --> 15:54.648
Oh, I beg to differ.

15:55.621 --> 15:58.715
My father took great pride
in his appearance.

15:58.958 --> 16:01.119
He was a very handsome man,
a Casanova, really.

16:01.293 --> 16:03.659
I'll give you $200
for the three boxes.

16:04.930 --> 16:08.229
Could you make it 225?
That was his high game in bowling.

16:09.735 --> 16:11.532
Yeah, I'm in a good mood. Here.

16:11.870 --> 16:13.337
Thank you.

16:13.505 --> 16:15.564
Hey, George.
What are you doing here?

16:16.976 --> 16:21.413
I'm just selling some of Dad's things.
That's what he would have wanted.

16:21.580 --> 16:23.480
Oh, I got you.

16:24.750 --> 16:27.241
- That'll do.
- Hey, guess what.

16:27.486 --> 16:30.717
Morty Seinfeld and I are going into
business together, selling raincoats.

16:30.923 --> 16:32.652
- That's swell.
- We worked it out...

16:32.825 --> 16:34.554
...all over dinner last night.
- Dinner?

16:34.927 --> 16:38.522
- You had dinner with the Seinfelds?
- Yeah, last night.

16:38.831 --> 16:40.594
Was this something
you had planned?

16:40.766 --> 16:42.563
No, it was spur of the moment.

16:42.868 --> 16:46.895
Well, you know Morty. He likes to fly
by the seat of his vintage pants.

16:47.773 --> 16:50.071
They had plans, huh?
They had plans!

16:51.243 --> 16:54.269
Boy, I've never seen these before.
They just came in.

16:54.446 --> 16:56.971
Part of my springtime
cruise collection.

16:57.616 --> 17:00.483
- Two for $25.
- Oh, I'll take these. Yeah.

17:01.153 --> 17:03.451
Hey, remember this raincoat
that you sold me?

17:03.622 --> 17:05.021
Sure. That's the Executive.

17:05.190 --> 17:08.090
- Do you have any others?
- I wish. They don't make it anymore.

17:08.359 --> 17:11.420
Suppose I told you I have 50
in mint condition. You interested?

17:11.597 --> 17:13.791
- Very interested.
- They're coming in from Florida.

17:13.965 --> 17:15.558
- Bring them in.
- So you'll buy them?

17:15.733 --> 17:17.792
I don't see what would
possibly stop me?

17:32.151 --> 17:34.278
They had plans, huh?
They were busy.

17:34.453 --> 17:37.115
They were busy
with their big plans, huh?

17:37.289 --> 17:39.655
- What are you talking about?
- Mom and Pop Seinfeld.

17:39.825 --> 17:42.316
- Look, I don't know.
- I know what they did last night.

17:42.494 --> 17:45.258
- They had dinner with Kramer.
- It was a last-minute thing.

17:45.431 --> 17:47.126
They won't have dinner
with my parents?

17:47.299 --> 17:49.096
- Right.
- Something wrong with my parents?

17:49.268 --> 17:51.600
- Absolutely.
- My parents are wonderful people.

17:51.770 --> 17:54.102
- These the same people you live with?
- Yes.

17:56.575 --> 18:00.011
- Are they coming tonight or not?
- I don't know what their plans are.

18:00.179 --> 18:02.647
Okay. Fine.

18:02.848 --> 18:04.338
It's gonna be very interesting...

18:04.750 --> 18:07.617
...very interesting
if they don't show up tonight.

18:07.820 --> 18:10.448
You know, my mother
made all this paella.

18:10.622 --> 18:12.522
What is that, anyway?

18:13.225 --> 18:14.624
It's a Spanish dish.

18:14.860 --> 18:17.556
It's a m <i>é</i> lange of fish
and meat with rice.

18:17.796 --> 18:19.787
- Very tasty.
- I'll tell them.

18:19.965 --> 18:22.263
- Could you do one other thing for me?
- Name it.

18:22.601 --> 18:24.626
Would your parents
have any objections...

18:24.803 --> 18:27.033
...to taking a little kid
to Paris with them?

18:31.844 --> 18:35.541
It turns out that the kid's father
lives in Paris.

18:35.714 --> 18:37.306
Is that a coincidence?

18:37.483 --> 18:40.043
You know, Alec wants me
to take him over there...

18:40.219 --> 18:42.380
...so I figure as long
as they're going...

18:42.554 --> 18:45.648
You thought as long as
they're mailing postcards...

18:45.824 --> 18:49.089
...it wouldn't be too much
to ask my parents to drag a child...

18:49.261 --> 18:52.355
...who they've never seen
through the streets of Paris?

18:53.632 --> 18:56.601
If you think it's too much,
they don't have to mail the postcards.

18:59.538 --> 19:02.371
So where's he taking you?

19:02.541 --> 19:05.601
Well, first we're going to a matinee.
I'm taking the afternoon off.

19:05.777 --> 19:07.438
We're gonna go see <i>My Fair Lady</i>.

19:07.713 --> 19:09.908
And then we're gonna
go to dinner.

19:10.115 --> 19:13.881
- He knows all these fantastic places.
- You are one lucky girl.

19:15.521 --> 19:17.318
Wish I could find a nice guy.

19:18.190 --> 19:20.522
- Hi, Aaron.
- Hey, Joanne.

19:21.827 --> 19:23.488
- Hey.
- Hi.

19:25.664 --> 19:28.565
- Hello, hello.
- Hello, Elaine.

19:33.705 --> 19:36.367
I was able to finagle
two more tickets to <i>My Fair Lady</i>...

19:36.542 --> 19:39.534
...and I thought, why not ask
Morty and Helen?

19:40.612 --> 19:43.046
- Great.
- This is some office.

19:43.248 --> 19:44.875
What's the square footage?

19:45.284 --> 19:49.118
- You don't mind, do you, Elaine?
- Mind? Oh, of course not.

19:49.288 --> 19:51.586
We can make a whole day of it.

19:51.757 --> 19:53.247
This is some building.

19:53.425 --> 19:55.620
Harry Fleming used to have
an office here.

19:55.794 --> 19:58.285
There was a deli on the first floor.

19:58.463 --> 20:00.931
You don't get corned beef
like that anymore.

20:01.867 --> 20:03.095
What happened to that deli?

20:03.869 --> 20:05.928
I really don't know, Mr. Seinfeld.

20:50.749 --> 20:52.614
We better not.

20:54.253 --> 20:56.847
They're gonna be here
any second.

20:57.055 --> 20:58.386
When are they leaving?

20:58.590 --> 21:00.319
In two days.

21:00.525 --> 21:03.494
- It's been so long.
- I know.

21:03.662 --> 21:05.425
Okay.

21:06.164 --> 21:09.133
- It's only two more days.
- Right.

21:09.334 --> 21:11.199
Thursday, 3:00.

21:17.676 --> 21:20.110
- Oh, hi.
- We didn't know you had company.

21:20.279 --> 21:22.144
Yeah. This is Rachel.

21:22.314 --> 21:23.872
- Hi.
- Hello, Rachel.

21:24.049 --> 21:26.313
- We'll come back another time.
- What other time?

21:26.485 --> 21:27.952
- Whenever.
- Where you going?

21:28.120 --> 21:30.850
- We'll drive around for a while.
- You don't have a car.

21:31.023 --> 21:33.014
- We'll take a bus.
- Come on. Stop.

21:33.191 --> 21:34.783
- No, we don't mind.
- I'll get a book.

21:34.960 --> 21:37.326
No, it's okay.
I was just leaving anyway.

21:37.496 --> 21:39.589
Are you sure?
Because we don't wanna...

21:39.765 --> 21:41.130
No, it's okay.

21:41.300 --> 21:43.734
- We'll go see <i>Schindler's List</i>, right?
- Definitely.

21:43.935 --> 21:45.300
Okay.

21:46.038 --> 21:48.006
- It was nice meeting you.
- Nice meeting you.

21:48.173 --> 21:49.800
- See you later.
- Bye-bye.

21:51.043 --> 21:52.908
Boy, that was some show.

21:53.111 --> 21:55.272
- What show?
- <i>My Fair Lady</i>.

21:55.480 --> 21:59.280
- When did you get tickets to see that?
- Aaron surprised us, and Elaine came.

21:59.451 --> 22:01.385
Oh, Elaine? Really?

22:01.553 --> 22:03.646
Well, that sounds interesting.

22:03.822 --> 22:06.689
We saw Regis Philbin
get out of a limousine.

22:06.925 --> 22:08.688
He looks better on TV.

22:12.898 --> 22:14.832
- Hello.
- Hello, Jerry.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.195
- Yeah?
- It's Jack Klompus.

22:17.369 --> 22:18.996
Oh, hi, Jack.

22:19.371 --> 22:21.839
So when are you coming down
to Florida again?

22:22.007 --> 22:25.033
As soon as is humanly possible.

22:25.243 --> 22:29.339
You know, I still got that pen,
the one that writes upside down.

22:29.514 --> 22:32.574
Yeah. I should have kept it.

22:32.784 --> 22:35.719
- So where's your father?
- Oh, he's right here.

22:36.922 --> 22:38.719
- Yeah?
- <i>Hello, Morty.</i>

22:39.224 --> 22:42.387
Listen, I can't get in the garage.

22:42.561 --> 22:44.620
- <i>What do you mean?</i>
- There is something...

22:44.796 --> 22:47.094
...wrong with the key.
The key doesn't work.

22:47.265 --> 22:49.825
- You gotta jiggle it a little bit.
- I jiggled it.

22:50.001 --> 22:52.162
I jiggled it for 15 minutes.

22:52.337 --> 22:54.828
Tell him to come down here
and get his own packages.

22:55.040 --> 22:57.600
You have nothing better to do
than worry about his boxes?

22:57.776 --> 22:59.641
You gotta pull on the knob
as you turn it.

22:59.811 --> 23:01.540
Get the hell out of here
with your knob!

23:01.713 --> 23:03.112
What does he want from you?

23:03.281 --> 23:05.374
My idiot son could open
that garage door.

23:05.717 --> 23:07.412
What did I do?

23:07.586 --> 23:10.020
Just do it first thing tomorrow.
I need it.

23:11.723 --> 23:13.748
They'll be here first thing
Thursday morning.

23:13.925 --> 23:16.792
Thursday morning?
You know we're leaving at 3:00.

23:16.962 --> 23:19.055
Yeah, you're leaving at 3:00.

23:19.231 --> 23:21.597
- How will you get this done?
- Don't worry about it.

23:21.767 --> 23:24.201
Yeah, how you gonna get
all this done in time?

23:24.503 --> 23:27.404
They were drinking
champagne in a buggy!

23:27.572 --> 23:30.132
- First Kramer, then Elaine?
- Yeah.

23:30.375 --> 23:33.902
- It's a slap in the face.
- What did we ever do to them?

23:34.079 --> 23:36.980
I wanna know what we did to them.

23:37.149 --> 23:39.640
What are they, too good for us?
A raincoat salesman.

23:39.818 --> 23:42.946
- I could buy and sell him, like that.
- The hell with them!

23:43.121 --> 23:46.613
The thing that bothers me the most
is the lying.

23:47.592 --> 23:49.025
Well, let's forget about it.

23:49.194 --> 23:51.856
We're going on a beautiful vacation.

23:52.130 --> 23:53.427
Vacation?

23:53.598 --> 23:56.590
Your mother and I are planning
on taking a cruise.

23:58.270 --> 24:00.761
But I can't find any
of my vacation clothes.

24:00.939 --> 24:02.372
They were in the attic.

24:03.141 --> 24:04.472
The attic?

24:04.709 --> 24:07.075
You haven't worn any
of those clothes for years.

24:07.312 --> 24:10.213
How can I go on a cruise
without my cabana-wear?

24:10.382 --> 24:12.350
I love those clothes.

24:12.517 --> 24:14.382
A mouse! I saw a mouse!

24:15.921 --> 24:17.354
It's the remote.

24:20.425 --> 24:23.656
Where the hell are my clothes?
I love those clothes.

24:24.496 --> 24:26.396
Lousy, moth-ridden crap.

24:29.468 --> 24:33.768
I'm not crazy about used clothes.
I mean, they call it vintage...

24:33.939 --> 24:37.534
...you know, to take your mind
off what it really is, nasty-wear.

24:37.943 --> 24:40.912
Oh, it's clean, you know.
People wear underwear.

24:41.079 --> 24:43.240
Yeah, well, they don't
wear iron underwear.

24:43.415 --> 24:46.316
And that's what it's gonna take
to get me in those clothes.

24:46.952 --> 24:49.716
I'll move into an apartment
after a strange person moves out.

24:49.888 --> 24:52.584
Why would I wanna move
into somebody's pants?

24:53.825 --> 24:56.453
There is no vintage underwear,
of course.

24:56.661 --> 24:59.186
But it's not because a guy
couldn't sell his underwear.

24:59.364 --> 25:01.195
It's because men
wear their underwear...

25:01.366 --> 25:03.994
...until it absolutely disintegrates.

25:04.236 --> 25:08.332
Men hang onto underwear
until each individual...

25:08.507 --> 25:10.805
...underwear molecule
is so strained...

25:10.976 --> 25:13.467
...it can barely retain
the properties of a solid.

25:13.678 --> 25:16.738
It actually becomes
underwear vapor.

25:16.948 --> 25:19.416
We don't even throw it out.
We just open a window...

25:19.584 --> 25:21.677
...and it goes out
like dandelion spores.

25:21.887 --> 25:24.720
That's how men throw out underwear.
We go... Then it's gone.

25:24.890 --> 25:26.653
That's it. It's just...

25:59.457 --> 26:02.893
- Hey, Jerry.
- So how was the movie?

26:03.094 --> 26:06.757
Oh, really good. Really good.

26:07.065 --> 26:10.296
- Didn't three hours go by like that?
- Like that.

26:10.468 --> 26:12.766
What about the end, with the list?

26:13.338 --> 26:15.568
Yeah, that was some list.

26:16.308 --> 26:18.105
What'd you think
of the black and white?

26:18.843 --> 26:20.333
The black and white?

26:20.679 --> 26:22.704
The whole movie
was in black and white.

26:22.881 --> 26:25.907
Oh, yeah, I didn't even realize.

26:26.217 --> 26:28.685
You don't think about it.
There's so much going on.

26:28.853 --> 26:32.789
Yeah. Yeah. I tell you,
I could see it again.

26:35.860 --> 26:38.658
So Klompus has the key,
but the jerk couldn't open it up.

26:38.830 --> 26:43.324
All you gotta do is jiggle it. You just
get it in there, jiggle it, jiggle it.

26:43.501 --> 26:46.197
Look, I find this whole thing
very uninteresting.

26:46.371 --> 26:50.068
- When you get the coats, come in.
- Oh, yeah. Hey, I'm on your side.

26:50.241 --> 26:51.708
Hey. What, again?

26:51.876 --> 26:54.071
I'm trying to buy some
of the clothes back.

26:54.245 --> 26:56.179
Hey, wanna come over
for dinner tonight?

26:56.348 --> 26:58.111
My mother made
all this extra paella.

26:58.283 --> 26:59.978
Paella? Yeah, I'll be there.

27:00.652 --> 27:03.985
Apparently, the Seinfelds
are too good for us.

27:04.222 --> 27:06.622
I shouldn't say anything bad
about your partner.

27:06.791 --> 27:09.726
No, no. We're not really partners.
I only get 25 percent.

27:09.995 --> 27:12.793
Twenty-five percent?
It was your idea.

27:12.964 --> 27:15.797
- Yeah, I know.
- You're doing all the legwork.

27:15.967 --> 27:17.958
- That's right.
- He's ripping you off.

27:18.136 --> 27:21.537
- You're right. He's ripping me off.
- You should be getting more.

27:21.706 --> 27:24.971
- He's ripping me off.
- Don't let him take advantage of you.

27:28.580 --> 27:30.047
Oh, it's you.

27:30.215 --> 27:32.740
You're the one who sold me
the moth-ridden cabana crap.

27:35.954 --> 27:37.922
You know, I've been thinking...

27:38.089 --> 27:40.216
...why is Kramer getting 25 percent?

27:40.392 --> 27:42.053
Well, he told you about the place.

27:42.227 --> 27:44.058
So what?
Why is that worth 25 percent?

27:44.229 --> 27:46.925
It's a finder's fee.
You know what a finder's fee is?

27:47.098 --> 27:49.066
You find something, you get a fee.

27:49.234 --> 27:51.361
A finder's fee is 10 percent,
no more.

27:51.536 --> 27:53.060
Well, it's too late now.

27:53.438 --> 27:56.430
Those are my coats.
I saved them, I stored them.

27:56.608 --> 27:58.337
I've been waiting years
for this payoff.

27:58.510 --> 28:00.910
Well, you're not gonna say anything.

28:01.079 --> 28:02.603
Hey.

28:03.682 --> 28:06.116
- I've been thinking about something.
- Yeah, so have l...

28:06.284 --> 28:08.946
- I don't think the deal is fair.
- You don't think it's fair?

28:09.120 --> 28:11.748
No, no. I found the place.
I set the whole thing up.

28:11.923 --> 28:14.118
- I'm doing all the legwork.
- What legwork?

28:14.292 --> 28:16.988
- There's legwork.
- lf anything, you're getting too much.

28:17.162 --> 28:19.357
- Too much?
- That's right. They're my coats.

28:19.531 --> 28:20.896
Okay, look, I want 35 percent.

28:21.066 --> 28:22.533
I'm thinking more like 15.

28:22.734 --> 28:26.135
- No way I'm taking 15.
- Well, you're not getting 35!

28:26.304 --> 28:28.135
All right, let's compromise.

28:28.406 --> 28:31.534
- Twenty-five percent.
- Okay, it's a deal.

28:33.378 --> 28:36.711
Moths are the scourge of my business.
All it takes is one moth to lay eggs.

28:36.881 --> 28:39.475
Know what happens to the larvae?
They hatch everywhere.

28:39.651 --> 28:41.050
Well, I'm sorry.

28:41.219 --> 28:43.619
Here's your money back.
And I'll take the clothes.

28:43.788 --> 28:46.450
This will hardly put a dent
in my fumigation bill.

28:46.658 --> 28:49.889
- So where are the clothes?
- I burned them.

28:51.563 --> 28:52.996
That's good.

28:54.899 --> 28:56.890
Now, I know they're
your parents, Jerry...

28:57.068 --> 28:58.660
...and they're very nice people.

28:59.237 --> 29:00.966
But don't you think it's odd...

29:01.139 --> 29:04.973
...that a 35-year-old man
is going to these lengths...

29:05.143 --> 29:08.010
...to see that someone else's parents
are enjoying themselves?

29:08.179 --> 29:10.511
I mean, don't you
find that abnormal?

29:10.749 --> 29:13.377
It is a tad askew.

29:14.586 --> 29:17.054
I mean, they're your parents,
and you don't do anything.

29:17.222 --> 29:18.519
Why's this stranger doing it?

29:18.690 --> 29:20.157
I've hardly been out with them.

29:20.325 --> 29:22.623
See? See?
And I can't even say anything...

29:22.794 --> 29:25.456
...you know, because
all he's really doing is being nice...

29:25.630 --> 29:28.258
...but nobody's this nice.
This is, like...

29:28.466 --> 29:32.027
...certifiably nice.
- You're right. He's insane.

29:32.203 --> 29:35.263
Yes, he's insane.
That's what I think.

29:35.707 --> 29:37.538
- So, what are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

29:37.709 --> 29:39.438
I don't know what to do.

29:39.744 --> 29:42.474
Oh, God. So how was the movie?

29:42.647 --> 29:45.707
From what I saw, it was pretty good.

29:45.917 --> 29:47.578
What do you mean,
"from what you saw"?

29:47.786 --> 29:51.381
Well, I didn't actually get
to see the whole movie.

29:52.056 --> 29:54.047
Yeah, why not?

29:54.425 --> 29:58.953
I was kind of making out.

30:01.833 --> 30:05.269
You were making out
during <i>Schindler's List</i> ?

30:05.436 --> 30:06.869
I couldn't help it.

30:07.071 --> 30:09.904
We hadn't been alone in a long time.
It got the better of me.

30:10.074 --> 30:13.373
- During <i>Schindler's List</i> ?
- We're both living with our parents.

30:13.545 --> 30:15.240
Did anybody see you
or say anything?

30:15.413 --> 30:18.439
Oh, I don't think so.
I saw Newman, but he didn't see me.

30:27.225 --> 30:29.420
Hello, Mrs. Seinfeld.

30:29.961 --> 30:32.657
Hello, Newman.

30:34.599 --> 30:36.032
Jerry's not here.

30:37.735 --> 30:39.760
Having a nice trip?

30:40.371 --> 30:43.272
Wonderful. We went to
the theater last night.

30:43.441 --> 30:45.170
Oh, the theater.

30:45.376 --> 30:48.106
- Because I was wondering...
- Wondering what?

30:48.279 --> 30:50.679
Why I didn't see you
at <i>Schindler's List</i> with Jerry.

30:50.849 --> 30:52.077
Well, we already saw it.

30:52.250 --> 30:55.845
Oh, well, it's a good thing
for Jerry that you didn't go.

30:56.154 --> 30:59.180
- Why is that?
- Well, he really seemed to have...

30:59.357 --> 31:01.518
...his hands full,
if you know what I mean?

31:01.726 --> 31:03.193
I'm afraid I don't.

31:03.361 --> 31:05.295
Him and his buxom little friend,
Rachel...

31:05.463 --> 31:07.556
...were going at it pretty good
in the balcony.

31:07.732 --> 31:09.723
- What?
- Do I have to spell it out for you?

31:09.901 --> 31:13.530
He was moving on her
like the stormtroopers into Poland.

31:14.038 --> 31:16.700
Jerry was necking
during <i>Schindler's List</i> ?

31:16.875 --> 31:18.103
Yes.

31:18.276 --> 31:21.575
And a more offensive spectacle
I cannot recall.

31:22.213 --> 31:25.341
Anyway, I just really came up
to get some detergent.

31:25.516 --> 31:28.417
- Jerry sends his laundry out.
- Oh, right.

31:28.586 --> 31:31.987
Well, it was nice seeing you folks.
Oh, by the way...

31:32.156 --> 31:35.421
...you didn't hear this from me.
Ta-ta.

31:41.366 --> 31:42.765
Hi.

31:50.241 --> 31:53.404
- What? What did I do?
- How could you?

31:53.578 --> 31:55.842
- How could I what?
- You were making out...

31:56.014 --> 31:57.845
...during <i>Schindler's List</i> ?

31:58.216 --> 31:59.547
What?

31:59.717 --> 32:02.151
- No.
- Don't lie, Jerry.

32:03.454 --> 32:04.978
Newman.

32:06.991 --> 32:10.324
- How could you do such a thing?
- I couldn't help it.

32:10.495 --> 32:13.123
We hadn't been alone together
in a long time.

32:13.298 --> 32:15.732
We started up a little
during the coming attractions...

32:15.900 --> 32:19.131
...and the next thing we knew
the war was over.

32:23.975 --> 32:26.000
- Hello.
- <i>Jerry</i>.

32:26.311 --> 32:29.144
- It's Jack Klompus.
- Hang on a second.

32:29.347 --> 32:31.406
Dad, it's Klompus.

32:31.616 --> 32:33.516
- Hello.
- <i>Hello, Morty?</i>

32:33.818 --> 32:36.787
Listen. That key doesn't work.

32:36.955 --> 32:39.549
- It's no good.
- You didn't get in?

32:39.724 --> 32:43.091
Oh, I got in.
I had to break the window with a rock.

32:43.261 --> 32:46.526
And then I got my hand
all cut up reaching in.

32:46.731 --> 32:49.894
- You broke the window?
- He broke the window?

32:50.068 --> 32:52.127
You wanted those damn boxes,
didn't you?

32:52.303 --> 32:55.534
He should be on his hands
and knees thanking you.

32:55.707 --> 32:57.174
- Did you send them?
- <i>Yeah</i>.

32:57.342 --> 33:00.539
They'll be there
tomorrow afternoon, 2:00.

33:00.712 --> 33:02.236
Tomorrow afternoon?

33:02.413 --> 33:04.813
- Tomorrow afternoon?
- Tomorrow afternoon?

33:04.983 --> 33:06.814
I told you to send them express.

33:06.985 --> 33:10.386
It was $ 10 cheaper
in the afternoon than the morning.

33:10.555 --> 33:12.386
I figured, what the hell's
the difference?

33:12.557 --> 33:16.049
- What did you do about the window?
- I gotta fix your window now?

33:16.227 --> 33:17.922
All right, all right. Goodbye.

33:19.731 --> 33:21.392
I don't think we'll make that flight.

33:21.566 --> 33:23.261
What do you mean
you won't make it?

33:23.434 --> 33:25.868
We have to make the flight.
We're with a charter group.

33:26.037 --> 33:27.334
If we don't, the trip is off.

33:27.505 --> 33:29.700
What's the difference?
We'll go someplace else.

33:29.874 --> 33:31.739
Someplace else?
What about Paris?

33:31.909 --> 33:35.242
You don't understand.
I've come this far. I can't stop now.

33:35.413 --> 33:39.213
I can't believe that you're doing all this
just to sell some stupid raincoats.

33:39.384 --> 33:40.783
You don't understand.

33:40.952 --> 33:43.352
Fashion is cyclical.
This thing could come back.

33:43.521 --> 33:45.182
I think you're out of your mind.

33:46.224 --> 33:51.093
I just don't understand
how all those clothes can disappear.

33:51.262 --> 33:54.663
- Moths?
- Moths ate three boxes?

33:54.832 --> 33:57.130
Well, you know what happens
when larvae hatch.

33:57.301 --> 33:58.791
They're everywhere.

33:59.070 --> 34:01.800
You know, I was thinking today.

34:02.006 --> 34:04.668
I never liked
those Seinfelds anyway.

34:04.842 --> 34:06.605
He's an idiot altogether.

34:07.645 --> 34:09.806
- Oh, there's Kramer.
- Hello!

34:09.981 --> 34:11.710
Hello!

34:13.051 --> 34:14.416
Hey.

34:16.020 --> 34:18.955
- Good evening.
- Hope you're hungry.

34:19.123 --> 34:20.351
Paella.

34:20.525 --> 34:22.993
- Here, let me take your coat.
- Oh, yeah. Thanks, buddy.

34:23.561 --> 34:25.426
- Hey.
- That shirt.

34:25.596 --> 34:27.257
- Where did you get that shirt?
- What?

34:27.431 --> 34:28.797
That's my cabana shirt.

34:28.966 --> 34:30.956
You stole my shirt,
you son of a bitch!

34:31.135 --> 34:33.899
George, your friends up in the attic,
stealing my clothes!

34:34.072 --> 34:36.835
Give me that back.
Give me that. Give me.

34:38.443 --> 34:39.967
I bought it from Rudy.

34:40.143 --> 34:42.442
Rudy! That skunk!

34:42.612 --> 34:45.047
- I knew he didn't burn those clothes!
- Who's Rudy?

34:45.216 --> 34:47.514
- What clothes?
- I sold your clothes yesterday.

34:47.685 --> 34:48.913
You sold my clothes?

34:49.087 --> 34:51.214
What do you mean,
you sold my clothes?

34:51.389 --> 34:55.085
- I didn't think you wore them anymore.
- It's cruise-wear!

34:55.827 --> 34:57.192
Kramer.

34:57.428 --> 34:59.623
- I love that shirt.
- Oh, yeah.

34:59.797 --> 35:01.662
That's because it's mine!

35:01.833 --> 35:03.824
You look just like Frank...

35:04.035 --> 35:06.401
...on our honeymoon.

35:06.604 --> 35:08.333
Well, thank you.

35:08.506 --> 35:10.235
- Who's this Rudy?
- Rudy's the guy...

35:10.408 --> 35:11.773
...buying Morty's raincoats.

35:11.943 --> 35:13.808
Morty Seinfeld? He's a bum.

35:13.978 --> 35:16.378
The whole deal's
going down tomorrow.

35:16.547 --> 35:19.175
- Morty's gonna miss his plane for it.
- Missing his plane?

35:19.350 --> 35:21.477
- Wasn't that a charter flight?
- Yeah.

35:21.652 --> 35:24.485
What happens to charter tickets
when you don't use them?

35:24.655 --> 35:26.486
Well, I suppose they're wasted.

35:26.691 --> 35:28.818
Yes, I suppose they are.

35:29.026 --> 35:31.927
Tomorrow I'm going straight down
to this Rudy and get my clothes.

35:32.096 --> 35:33.723
- A mouse!
- Egad! A mouse!

35:33.898 --> 35:36.162
In the bedroom!

35:47.178 --> 35:48.941
- You want the tickets?
- Yes.

35:49.113 --> 35:51.081
You're gonna take this kid to Paris?

35:51.249 --> 35:54.616
I get a free trip to Paris.
I go in the Big Brothers' Hall of Fame.

35:54.785 --> 35:56.013
I mail my own postcards.

35:56.187 --> 36:00.317
- You know I'm paying for these tickets.
- It's all right. I got lunch.

36:04.428 --> 36:07.158
You should've gone
to the Costanzas' for dinner.

36:07.632 --> 36:09.497
The paella was magnificent.

36:09.734 --> 36:12.362
Have you ever had
really good paella?

36:12.537 --> 36:15.370
- Not really.
- It's an orgiastic feast for the senses...

36:15.540 --> 36:19.408
...a wanton festival of sights,
sounds and colors and...

36:21.546 --> 36:23.446
Dad, you sure we're at
the right carousel?

36:23.614 --> 36:25.605
- This is it.
- So how much are we gonna make?

36:25.783 --> 36:28.616
Take it easy. I've been through
a million of these negotiations.

36:28.786 --> 36:30.083
Two thousand? Three thousand?

36:30.254 --> 36:32.552
That's giving it away.
This is a one-of-a-kind item.

36:32.723 --> 36:36.181
- More? More than 3000?
- Just watch me do my thing.

36:37.261 --> 36:40.355
- Say, Dad, isn't that one of yours?
- Look at this.

36:40.565 --> 36:42.192
Look how this idiot packed it.

36:42.400 --> 36:44.391
He didn't tape it.
He just flipped the flaps.

36:44.569 --> 36:46.196
Wait. Hold it.

36:47.138 --> 36:48.537
Kramer, you missed a couple.

36:48.706 --> 36:52.039
<i>Bonjour</i>, welcome to
the Gateway to Paris charter flight.

36:52.210 --> 36:53.802
Dad, isn't that your charter group?

36:54.645 --> 36:56.738
Honesty. Hard work.

36:57.014 --> 36:59.380
These are the values
that I was raised with.

36:59.584 --> 37:01.074
The most important thing, Joey...

37:01.252 --> 37:04.153
...is to be able to look yourself
in the mirror before you sleep.

37:04.322 --> 37:06.153
Hey, I got news for you, four-eyes...

37:06.324 --> 37:09.157
...there's no way you're staying
with us in Paris.

37:14.198 --> 37:16.758
You burned them?
Those clothes are not yours to burn.

37:16.934 --> 37:18.629
- Who are you, anyways?
- I'm the father.

37:18.803 --> 37:21.397
- He said his father was dead.
- He said I was dead?

37:21.572 --> 37:24.564
That's right.
Squeezed an extra $25 out of me.

37:24.875 --> 37:27.309
That's what my life
is worth to him, $25?

37:27.478 --> 37:29.571
- Hey, Frank!
- Oh, hey.

37:29.747 --> 37:32.648
I want you to know that
I'm retracting our dinner invitation.

37:32.817 --> 37:34.751
You don't have to retract it.
We never went.

37:34.919 --> 37:37.149
I'm retracting that
it was ever offered.

37:37.321 --> 37:39.084
I retract your retraction.

37:39.257 --> 37:41.555
What are you, trying to unload
some junk of yours?

37:41.726 --> 37:44.320
Will you excuse me, please?
We're conducting business here.

37:44.595 --> 37:45.960
Keep them. I'm not interested.

37:46.130 --> 37:48.860
- I thought we had a deal?
- That's another one of my shirts!

37:49.033 --> 37:51.160
Not buying any more clothes
from anyone off the street.

37:51.335 --> 37:53.633
The street?
I'm in the raincoat business 35 years.

37:53.804 --> 37:57.240
- Maybe they have moths, like his stuff.
- My clothes don't have moths!

37:57.408 --> 37:59.968
Because of his moths,
you're not buying my raincoats?

38:00.144 --> 38:03.602
- That's right.
- I'm all ticklish.

38:08.219 --> 38:12.679
<i>Flight 433 now boarding</i>
<i>for Miami at gate 18-A.</i>

38:12.857 --> 38:16.520
- <i>Flight 433 now boarding.</i>
- Okay. Let's go.

38:16.761 --> 38:19.662
It was so nice of you to come
to the airport to see us off.

38:19.930 --> 38:21.898
Are you sure you can't stay
a little longer?

38:22.066 --> 38:23.829
- No!
- No!

38:24.001 --> 38:25.229
- Goodbye.
- Bye-bye.

38:25.403 --> 38:26.893
- Take care.
- Okay, Jer.

38:27.071 --> 38:29.164
- Bye-bye, Elaine.
- Bye-bye.

38:30.975 --> 38:33.068
We'll call you when we get home.

38:33.644 --> 38:34.941
Thank you.

38:35.112 --> 38:36.704
I think she meant me, but...

38:37.114 --> 38:39.912
Make sure Kramer uses good tape
to send back the raincoats.

38:40.084 --> 38:41.915
- Okay.
- Bye.

38:42.086 --> 38:44.418
- Bye.
- Aaron?

38:45.089 --> 38:46.488
Aaron, are you okay?

38:46.657 --> 38:48.284
I could've done more.

38:48.492 --> 38:50.323
I could've done so much more.

38:51.128 --> 38:53.596
- You did enough.
- No.

38:53.798 --> 38:55.629
I could've called the travel agency...

38:55.800 --> 38:57.631
...got them on
another flight to Paris.

38:57.802 --> 38:59.997
- I could've got them out!
- You tried, Aaron.

39:00.171 --> 39:03.038
- It was too expensive.
- This watch.

39:03.808 --> 39:06.436
This watch could've paid
for their whole trip.

39:06.644 --> 39:08.407
This ring.

39:08.646 --> 39:12.173
This ring is one more dinner
I could've taken them out to.

39:13.617 --> 39:15.107
Water.

39:15.353 --> 39:17.583
- They need some water.
- Why?

39:17.822 --> 39:19.619
They'll get dehydrated on the plane!

39:19.790 --> 39:21.087
Get the Seinfelds some water!

39:21.492 --> 39:22.823
Please!

39:23.094 --> 39:24.652
Please!

39:32.570 --> 39:34.299
Hi, Mr. Goldstein. Is Rachel home?

39:34.472 --> 39:36.872
I'm afraid Rachel is not going
to see you tonight...

39:37.041 --> 39:38.736
...or any other night for that matter.

39:38.909 --> 39:40.809
- Why? What did I do?
- You know very well.

39:40.978 --> 39:43.606
I heard about your behavior
at the movies the other night.

39:43.781 --> 39:46.306
It was disgraceful.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

39:46.550 --> 39:48.814
I will not allow
my daughter to be involved...

39:48.986 --> 39:51.511
...with someone of such weak
moral fiber.

39:51.722 --> 39:54.816
Fortunately, my postman happened
to witness the entire incident.

39:54.992 --> 39:57.460
A heavyset fellow. I believe
he lives in your building.

39:57.628 --> 39:59.823
- Now, if you don't mind...
- Rachel.

40:00.064 --> 40:01.588
- Rachel.
- Good night.

40:03.300 --> 40:05.495
So my parents get home,
they open the door...

40:05.669 --> 40:08.832
...my father flicks the light on, and
the whole place is cleaned out.

40:09.006 --> 40:11.065
- Everything.
- Get out.

40:11.275 --> 40:13.300
- How did that happen?
- The broken window.

40:13.477 --> 40:16.241
Klompus never fixed it.
They just walked right in.

40:16.447 --> 40:18.506
Boy, they could use a vacation.

40:18.682 --> 40:22.277
They're taking one. The travel agent's
trying to set something up for them.

40:22.453 --> 40:23.750
So how about that Aaron?

40:24.922 --> 40:26.685
You know what drove me crazy
about him?

40:26.857 --> 40:30.020
Did you ever notice he stood
too close to you when he talked?

40:30.428 --> 40:32.293
No, I hadn't noticed.

40:34.365 --> 40:36.060
Pair of bear claws, please.

40:38.269 --> 40:41.602
- Hi, Newman.
- Hello, Jerry.

40:41.772 --> 40:45.208
I happened to catch you coming out
of <i>Schindler's List</i> the other night.

40:45.376 --> 40:47.367
Oh, were you there?

40:47.645 --> 40:49.510
Yes, I was.

40:49.747 --> 40:52.147
- It's a powerful film.
- Yeah.

40:52.316 --> 40:54.944
- Shocking brutality, don't you think?
- Shocking.

40:55.119 --> 40:57.781
- Yeah, well, that was nothing.
- Jerry! Jerry!

41:01.525 --> 41:03.220
Where the hell is your father?

41:09.934 --> 41:11.868
This is the best thing we ever did.

41:12.036 --> 41:14.300
I hope those exterminators
know what they're doing.

41:14.472 --> 41:17.873
Forget about them.
Let's just try and relax.

41:18.476 --> 41:20.535
Personal distance is
a very important thing.

41:20.711 --> 41:22.906
There's a new personal distance,
ATM distance.

41:23.080 --> 41:26.607
When someone's using an ATM,
you wanna be about 6 feet back.

41:26.784 --> 41:29.719
Don't you? Because people get
edgy around that ATM, don't they?

41:29.887 --> 41:33.084
They got their money out,
their eyes are darting all around.

41:33.290 --> 41:36.418
The other place I wanna be
6 feet away is a urinal.

41:36.627 --> 41:38.686
You want some distance there too.

41:38.896 --> 41:41.729
ATMs and urinals. I guess whenever
someone's taking valuables...

41:41.899 --> 41:45.232
...out of their pants, you wanna give
them as much room as possible.
