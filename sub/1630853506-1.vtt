WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:03.640
You'll repay your debt to society

00:03.640 --> 00:06.360
by working the number of hours
mandated by the court.

00:08.760 --> 00:10.400
We found it, we're entitled to it.

00:10.400 --> 00:14.240
Are you citing the legal precedent
"finders keeper, losers weepers"?

00:23.280 --> 00:25.680
Don't worry, ma'am. I've got eyes in
the back of my head.

00:25.680 --> 00:29.160
I have this cupboard in my office.
I call it the Cupboard of Chaos.

00:29.160 --> 00:31.360
I gave your cupboard
a little spring clean.

00:33.800 --> 00:35.880
You pissed my company down
the drain!

00:35.880 --> 00:38.400
I didn't piss anything,
OK? I'm saving it!

00:38.400 --> 00:39.840
I love you, Dad.

00:39.840 --> 00:42.600
I spent 18 months in a prison cell.

00:42.600 --> 00:46.920
I'm not spending my
last few years in another one!

00:46.920 --> 00:49.920
PC Colin Denison died in that fire.

00:49.920 --> 00:51.520
The guilt won't go away.

00:58.280 --> 01:00.480
Find my money and whoever took it

01:00.480 --> 01:04.640
because now I have to kill either
them or you just to make a point.

02:37.280 --> 02:39.720
I'm in trouble. I need your help.

02:42.240 --> 02:43.600
Please.

02:45.480 --> 02:46.600
Esme...

02:47.800 --> 02:50.160
..we've got something
to tell you.

02:50.160 --> 02:52.440
Oh, my God.
Did you get her pregnant?

02:52.440 --> 02:54.160
No. No!

02:54.160 --> 02:55.680
We're friends. Yeah, pals.

02:55.680 --> 02:58.280
Anyway, erm, Rani's going to be
staying with us for a bit.

02:58.280 --> 02:59.720
Are the feds after you?

02:59.720 --> 03:03.880
No, I...I just got into
a massive fight with my parents.

03:03.880 --> 03:06.600
I told them I didn't want to go
to Oxford and I left.

03:06.600 --> 03:08.800
Oh. So, your first thought was
to come here

03:08.800 --> 03:10.320
cos we've got so much space?

03:10.320 --> 03:12.000
Come on, Es. We owe her.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.280
Maybe. But she's not having my bed.

03:14.280 --> 03:16.160
Don't worry, you can...you can take
my bed.

03:16.160 --> 03:17.440
No, no,

03:17.440 --> 03:19.960
I can't throw you out of your
own bed.

03:19.960 --> 03:21.760
Or you two could share.

03:21.760 --> 03:22.920
No.

03:22.920 --> 03:25.200
No, I'm... I'm.... No.
I'm going stay in here.

03:25.200 --> 03:27.080
Right. Uh, make yourself
comfy. Mm-hm.

03:27.080 --> 03:29.600
I'm making food. Do you
want some? Love some.

03:34.640 --> 03:35.960
I see you.

03:35.960 --> 03:37.120
Sorry, you see me?

03:37.120 --> 03:39.720
Trying to get in my brother's
Ninja Turtle boxers.

03:39.720 --> 03:42.680
I'm not trying to get
into your brother's anything.

03:42.680 --> 03:43.840
I left home, Es.

03:43.840 --> 03:45.680
Hey, Ran. Yep.

03:45.680 --> 03:47.240
Are you ready to try this, yeah?

03:47.240 --> 03:50.200
Oh, God. It's my grandma's recipe.
OK. Are you ready? Yeah.

03:52.120 --> 03:53.720
Oh, my God, that's amazing!

03:53.720 --> 03:54.800
Yeah? Mm.

03:54.800 --> 03:57.800
You sure? Yeah. God, you should open
a restaurant or something.

03:57.800 --> 04:00.240
That is so yummy.
Yeah, maybe I will.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.240
Maybe you should eat in one first.

04:02.240 --> 04:03.720
I've eaten in restaurants.

04:03.720 --> 04:05.360
Only ones with photos on the menu.

04:05.360 --> 04:07.880
Ain't you got something else
to be doing?

04:07.880 --> 04:11.720
"Ohh, that's amazing!
You should open a restaurant!"

04:11.720 --> 04:13.920
I didn't say it like that.

04:13.920 --> 04:16.000
You definitely said it like that.
No, I didn't!

04:16.000 --> 04:18.600
You did. I didn't. You did.
No, I didn't. You did. No.

04:26.360 --> 04:29.720
Hello, Your Ladyship.
We're here to film the commercial.

04:29.720 --> 04:31.920
For social media.

04:31.920 --> 04:33.600
I thought that was on Wednesday.

04:33.600 --> 04:35.200
It is Wednesday.

04:37.040 --> 04:38.400
Great.

04:57.920 --> 04:59.280
What?

04:59.280 --> 05:01.960
It was...someone's birthday.

05:08.760 --> 05:12.040
Steve, sorry. Erm, this is Lesley.
I know you spoke on the phone.

05:12.040 --> 05:13.080
Hi.

06:12.480 --> 06:15.520
Do you think I'm stupid enough to
hide the money in my bedroom, Frank?

06:15.520 --> 06:17.320
I mean, come on.
Would you do that?

06:17.320 --> 06:20.240
You made your point, Tommy,
but let's stop playing.

06:20.240 --> 06:23.800
What's a teenage boy going to spend
all that money on?

06:23.800 --> 06:25.120
Pornography?

06:25.120 --> 06:28.040
Why would I pay for porn?
It's free on the internet.

06:28.040 --> 06:29.280
It is?

06:29.280 --> 06:31.840
You shouldn't have hidden
the money back in the attic, Frank.

06:31.840 --> 06:33.960
It was lazy. So, to teach you
a lesson,

06:33.960 --> 06:35.920
I'm going to use it to pay off
Mum's mortgage.

06:35.920 --> 06:39.040
You know, you can't just walk into
your mom's bank and hand it over.

06:39.040 --> 06:40.400
You have to wash it first.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.240
What, like, clean off
the fingerprints?

06:42.240 --> 06:44.480
You must've heard of washing money,
laundering money

06:44.480 --> 06:47.360
to make it look like you earned
it legitimately.

06:47.360 --> 06:49.520
What do they teach you at
that school?

06:49.520 --> 06:51.000
How do you wash money?

06:51.000 --> 06:54.520
Smurfing. Offshore shell companies.
Casinos are good.

06:54.520 --> 06:55.960
Why?

06:55.960 --> 06:59.120
You walk into a casino,
you buy chips with the cash.

06:59.120 --> 07:01.720
You play for a while,
you cash in the chips,

07:01.720 --> 07:03.360
you get paid by cheque.

07:03.360 --> 07:07.080
Now your money looks like
legitimate winnings.

07:07.080 --> 07:09.000
Fine, I'll take it to a casino.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.760
Great. You just have to wait till
you turn 18 in two years' time.

07:12.760 --> 07:15.080
Or we could split the money fairly.

07:15.080 --> 07:17.560
Say 80-20.

07:17.560 --> 07:19.280
You're not getting the money back.

07:19.280 --> 07:22.320
But, uh, here's
your plane ticket to Rio.

07:22.320 --> 07:25.920
We both know you don't love Mum,
you don't love me or Holly.

07:25.920 --> 07:27.680
Your tag comes off tomorrow, so...

07:29.320 --> 07:30.640
..take it and go.

07:33.280 --> 07:36.040
I loved making my own
fizzy drinks as a kid,

07:36.040 --> 07:39.800
and this new deluxe at-home
soda maker takes me right back

07:39.800 --> 07:41.680
to being just eight years old.

07:43.600 --> 07:45.840
Just choose the flavour
of your choice...

07:47.920 --> 07:49.840
..and voila.

07:51.480 --> 07:53.640
Oh! Fizzy cunt! Fuck!

07:53.640 --> 07:55.120
Was that OK, darling?

07:55.120 --> 07:57.400
Erm, I'm not sure the
client will be totally happy

07:57.400 --> 07:59.960
with you calling their product
the C word.

07:59.960 --> 08:01.280
Do you want to call and check?

08:01.280 --> 08:03.120
Could we just go one more time?

08:03.120 --> 08:05.000
Really?

08:05.000 --> 08:08.800
This new deluxe at-home soda maker
takes me right back

08:08.800 --> 08:10.280
to being eight years old.

08:15.160 --> 08:17.280
Mm, delicious!

08:18.320 --> 08:19.600
I think we got it.

08:19.600 --> 08:22.120
Uh, we did but there was
a naked man in the shot.

08:22.120 --> 08:23.720
So could we just go again?

08:23.720 --> 08:25.560
No, that was a really good one.
Yeah, it was,

08:25.560 --> 08:27.680
but, uh, I'm not sure the client
will be happy

08:27.680 --> 08:30.840
with a commercial aimed at kids
featuring an actual man's penis.

08:30.840 --> 08:32.240
Well, just take it out with GCI.

08:32.240 --> 08:35.480
We don't have the budget for CGI.
This is for Instagram.

08:35.480 --> 08:36.840
One more time, please?

08:36.840 --> 08:38.640
I mean, who even buys these things?

08:38.640 --> 08:40.640
Who has ever drunk
a can of Coke and thought,

08:40.640 --> 08:43.400
"Ooh, yeah, I like that, but damn,
I wish I was more involved

08:43.400 --> 08:45.280
"in the manufacturing process"?

08:45.280 --> 08:47.960
One more time for luck?

08:47.960 --> 08:50.400
I loved making my own fizzy drinks
as a kid,

08:50.400 --> 08:53.760
and this new deluxe at-home
soda maker takes me right back

08:53.760 --> 08:55.240
to being six years old,

08:55.240 --> 08:57.080
the year my mother killed herself.

08:58.560 --> 09:00.560
Get in, you bastard!

09:00.560 --> 09:02.480
I think you've got
it in the wrong way.

09:11.560 --> 09:12.960
I think we've got it.

09:14.960 --> 09:17.600
From my analysis, your production
model is the weak link.

09:17.600 --> 09:18.760
It's old-fashioned.

09:18.760 --> 09:21.200
Now, I've identified ways to
ramp up profitability,

09:21.200 --> 09:23.040
but it will involve a
radical overhaul

09:23.040 --> 09:24.440
of how things are done here.

09:24.440 --> 09:28.520
How things are done here is how
they've been done for 40 years.

09:28.520 --> 09:31.440
Your son tells me he's negotiated
a possible partnership

09:31.440 --> 09:33.560
with a competitor,
uh, Hilgard Auto Frictions.

09:33.560 --> 09:35.320
My son knows I'll be six foot under

09:35.320 --> 09:37.680
before I do any business
with Graham Hilgard.

09:37.680 --> 09:39.440
Given the state of your finances,

09:39.440 --> 09:43.240
it's an idea that needs
serious consideration.

09:43.240 --> 09:45.200
Lesley, is it?

09:45.200 --> 09:47.600
Can I speak privately
with my son for a moment?

09:57.280 --> 09:59.040
Trouble-shooters, huh?

09:59.040 --> 10:01.040
Another one of your masterplans.

10:01.040 --> 10:02.760
Like taking stolen money.

10:02.760 --> 10:05.000
She's a business enhancement
specialist, Dad.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.680
And she says that a company like
ours that isn't progressing

10:08.680 --> 10:10.760
is regressing.

10:10.760 --> 10:12.040
She's right.

10:13.080 --> 10:14.760
There is a weak link here.

10:19.600 --> 10:21.440
But it's not the production model.

10:26.840 --> 10:29.480
They're refusing to pay me for
the advert!

10:29.480 --> 10:31.480
Well, yes, because as
brand ambassador,

10:31.480 --> 10:33.320
your contract states that you
will refrain

10:33.320 --> 10:35.960
from offensive remarks
or conduct. I did.

10:35.960 --> 10:39.600
You smashed up their soda maker,
then called it a C bomb!

10:39.600 --> 10:41.880
Hold the lift, please!

10:41.880 --> 10:43.720
That's the lady I told you about.

10:43.720 --> 10:46.040
The one you like?
Yeah, what do I do?

10:46.040 --> 10:47.200
Be yourself.

10:50.040 --> 10:52.760
Thanks, Greg. Oh, no problem,
Anne-Marie. Which floor?

10:52.760 --> 10:54.920
We work on the same floor.

10:54.920 --> 10:56.680
Oh!

10:58.560 --> 11:01.280
Good for you for cycling to work.
That's very healthy.

11:01.280 --> 11:03.200
No, no, it's a bad idea.

11:03.200 --> 11:05.160
I'm sweating so much,
I need another shower now.

11:05.160 --> 11:07.880
Oh. Oh, yeah. You don't want to get
a yeast infection.

11:07.880 --> 11:09.160
No.

11:11.480 --> 11:14.680
I just mean from wearing
the same sweaty clothes all day.

11:16.040 --> 11:19.720
You know, can create humid
crotch conditions.

11:21.720 --> 11:26.960
Leading to a build-up of fungus
in your...vaginal cavity.

11:31.960 --> 11:33.440
See you later. See you later.

11:34.440 --> 11:36.280
Smooth.

11:36.280 --> 11:37.760
Really smooth.

11:44.320 --> 11:47.120
Ah, thanking you,
Greg-a-leg-a-ding-dong.

11:47.120 --> 11:50.080
That's so sweet. You collect
his dry cleaning for him?

11:50.080 --> 11:51.600
Yeah, we have a little quid pro quo.

11:51.600 --> 11:53.880
He scratches my back and I don't
send him to prison.

11:53.880 --> 11:55.960
He's a joker. Ignore him.

11:55.960 --> 11:59.040
Come on, then, Greg, when are you
going to ask Anne-Marie out? Sh!

11:59.040 --> 12:00.840
Anne-Marie? You absolute horndog.

12:00.840 --> 12:03.640
I'm not asking anybody out, all
right? It's against company policy.

12:03.640 --> 12:05.840
I don't care, Greg.
I can smell office romance.

12:05.840 --> 12:07.800
Er, no, you can smell
Greg's aftershave.

12:07.800 --> 12:09.480
"Lonely by Paco Rabanne."

12:09.480 --> 12:10.680
Hey, I think it's romantic

12:10.680 --> 12:12.920
that a woman you work with might
be your next wife.

12:12.920 --> 12:17.120
No, no, his next wife is a Latvian
conman posing as a swimwear model.

12:17.120 --> 12:20.240
What about the commercial,
all right? You need a payday.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.880
Let's sue them. You can't afford to
sue them, all right?

12:22.880 --> 12:24.800
Your father's frozen your allowance.

12:24.800 --> 12:25.840
What? Since when?

12:25.840 --> 12:27.840
Since you ruined his lawn
with your car!

12:27.840 --> 12:30.600
Oh, for God's sake! It's only grass,
it'll grow back.

12:30.600 --> 12:32.800
The Bank of Daddy is closed,
Your Ladyship, all right?

12:32.800 --> 12:35.240
You need to cut down on
your outgoings. Why?

12:35.240 --> 12:37.400
Why? Cos you're spending like
a crazy person!

12:37.400 --> 12:39.760
Look at this - bar bills,
restaurant bills.

12:39.760 --> 12:41.880
You've been buying clothes
and bags

12:41.880 --> 12:43.840
and a Tempur-Pedic cat bed!

12:43.840 --> 12:45.280
A Gucci skateboard?

12:45.280 --> 12:46.680
You've bought two wet suits!

12:46.680 --> 12:48.120
One of them is formal.

12:48.120 --> 12:49.960
Six grand on Uber Eats!

12:49.960 --> 12:51.880
For a year, that's fine!

12:51.880 --> 12:53.200
That was August!

12:53.200 --> 12:55.040
£580 on tarot readings!

12:55.040 --> 12:58.000
I am not cutting out Madame Orion.
She sees things.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.720
Has she seen that you'll be bankrupt
by Christmas?

13:00.720 --> 13:02.720
No, she bloody hasn't!

13:02.720 --> 13:04.360
All right, fine, ditch the bitch.

13:04.360 --> 13:07.120
I will try and cut back on
my spending.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.520
But meanwhile...

13:10.120 --> 13:11.680
..what's your next move?

13:11.680 --> 13:13.920
To the kitchen to make me tea
and toast.

13:17.680 --> 13:20.320
Oh, and spread the jam right to
the edges this time.

13:23.040 --> 13:26.760
I can't believe he does that
for you. What a sweet guy.

13:26.760 --> 13:28.160
Isn't he?

13:32.400 --> 13:34.160
This is called a beep test.

13:35.440 --> 13:38.640
It is used to test the
aerobic capacity

13:38.640 --> 13:41.280
of trainee PCSOs like myself.

13:41.280 --> 13:42.640
What's a PCSO?

13:42.640 --> 13:44.240
A Police Community Support Officer.

13:44.240 --> 13:45.400
Uniformed civilians.

13:45.400 --> 13:48.440
Like a supply teacher, but with less
authority and respect.

13:48.440 --> 13:51.320
Not true. We provide a reassuring
presence on the street

13:51.320 --> 13:54.440
and tackle the scourge
of antisocial behaviour,

13:54.440 --> 13:57.640
working alongside the police.
The real police.

13:57.640 --> 13:59.360
Can you arrest someone?

13:59.360 --> 14:01.640
No. Do you carry handcuffs?

14:01.640 --> 14:04.040
No. Can you investigate a crime?

14:04.040 --> 14:05.760
No. Can you Taser someone?

14:05.760 --> 14:07.680
Look, if you've got questions,
Google 'em.

14:07.680 --> 14:10.080
Oh, shit.

14:10.080 --> 14:12.080
You're barely out of short trousers,

14:12.080 --> 14:15.640
where does a teenager hide something
they don't want a parent to find?

14:15.640 --> 14:16.840
Well, my mum's an addict,

14:16.840 --> 14:18.760
so she was the one hiding stuff
from me.

14:18.760 --> 14:20.840
First time I stole anything,

14:20.840 --> 14:23.360
I was so paranoid
my parents would find out,

14:23.360 --> 14:25.200
I didn't even bring it home.

14:25.200 --> 14:26.680
So, where'd you stash it?

14:26.680 --> 14:28.440
My locker. At school.

14:28.440 --> 14:29.760
Oh. Hmm.

14:29.760 --> 14:32.520
Notice how the beeps...

14:32.520 --> 14:34.800
..are getting closer and

14:34.800 --> 14:37.120
closer together...

14:37.120 --> 14:40.560
..but my pace has not slowed. BEEP

14:40.560 --> 14:42.920
So do I need to be buying a hat?

14:42.920 --> 14:44.760
Do you need a hat?

14:44.760 --> 14:46.880
I mean for your wedding.

14:48.480 --> 14:50.440
What? No! We're just friends.

14:50.440 --> 14:52.960
Who are living together.

14:52.960 --> 14:54.880
What? As lovers?

14:54.880 --> 14:58.120
No. As roommates. It's temporary.

14:58.120 --> 15:01.320
Yeah, well, my mum moved her
boyfriend in temporarily,

15:01.320 --> 15:05.280
so she said, and Trevor has been
stinking out the bathroom

15:05.280 --> 15:07.040
for months now.

15:07.040 --> 15:09.080
Ah. Ah!

15:09.080 --> 15:11.480
Ah! Oh!

15:11.480 --> 15:14.080
Right. Who wants a go at the
beep test?

15:14.080 --> 15:16.040
I'm fine. A no on the beep testing,
thank you.

15:16.040 --> 15:18.960
All right, fine. Good luck with
all your heart disease.

15:20.600 --> 15:24.680
OK, back to it. You still all have
lots of hours to work off.

15:27.240 --> 15:29.880
Oi, you two. Come here.

15:29.880 --> 15:32.200
So, as trainee PCSO,

15:32.200 --> 15:33.760
that business with your sister

15:33.760 --> 15:35.680
is the last time I turn any more
blind eyes.

15:35.680 --> 15:37.200
Any more trouble from
the two of you,

15:37.200 --> 15:39.120
and it's no more Mrs Nice Guy.

15:39.120 --> 15:42.280
If you feel yourself being pulled to
the dark side,

15:42.280 --> 15:45.400
talk to me. Yeah? Believe it or not,

15:45.400 --> 15:47.840
I used to be a bad girl with
a hot boyfriend like you.

15:47.840 --> 15:48.960
He's not my boyfriend.

15:48.960 --> 15:52.040
Massimo was the hottest boy
in school.

15:52.040 --> 15:53.440
Everyone was jealous.

15:53.440 --> 15:55.520
They were like,
"Diane, how did you bag

15:55.520 --> 15:57.160
"that smoking-hot piece of tail?"

15:57.160 --> 16:00.680
Three words - charisma and cider.

16:00.680 --> 16:02.640
Massimo had a mantra -

16:02.640 --> 16:05.360
"Live fast, die young,

16:05.360 --> 16:07.960
"leave a good-looking corpse."

16:07.960 --> 16:09.400
Which he did.

16:09.400 --> 16:12.360
Massimo died? Yeah.
He was driving a stolen car,

16:12.360 --> 16:15.480
being chased by police,
crashed into a building site.

16:15.480 --> 16:18.160
Scaffolding pole
went right through his brain.

16:18.160 --> 16:20.920
To be honest, he did not leave
a good-looking corpse.

16:20.920 --> 16:25.760
But that woke me up and I turned my
life around 360 degrees.

16:25.760 --> 16:27.600
Doesn't that leave you where
you started?

16:27.600 --> 16:29.040
No, not me.

16:30.280 --> 16:32.080
I'm paying it forward,

16:32.080 --> 16:33.880
giving you both a second
chance, yeah?

16:33.880 --> 16:37.400
So the rest of your life starts
right here,

16:37.400 --> 16:39.240
right now. Yeah?

16:40.760 --> 16:42.840
Right after you pick up
that dog shit.

17:01.040 --> 17:03.280
Greg, what are you doing?!
He's threatening to kill us!

17:03.280 --> 17:04.960
I thought he was flirting.

17:04.960 --> 17:07.680
Do you reckon he's after
that money?

17:07.680 --> 17:09.040
What money?

17:16.720 --> 17:20.200
When I stole the line,
I also stole some money.

17:20.200 --> 17:21.520
Why didn't you tell me this?

17:21.520 --> 17:23.480
The less you know, the less
you're involved.

17:23.480 --> 17:26.040
I was chased by men
with machetes.

17:26.040 --> 17:27.640
I'm already involved.

17:27.640 --> 17:29.840
Wait, you stole the money?
I thought it was yours.

17:29.840 --> 17:31.240
Why would I have that much money?

17:31.240 --> 17:32.640
Because you're a drug dealer?

17:32.640 --> 17:35.360
Why is he automatically a drug
dealer? What, because he's black?

17:35.360 --> 17:38.040
Because he had hundreds of thousands
of pounds in a bag!

17:38.040 --> 17:41.160
Plus he threatened me.
Right? With a real gun.

17:41.160 --> 17:43.800
Not just his fingers. Look, I'm not
saying he's not a criminal,

17:43.800 --> 17:45.440
but why does he have to be
a drug dealer?

17:45.440 --> 17:48.560
Why can't he be doing tax evasion
or...or art fraud?

17:48.560 --> 17:51.560
Hmm. You've been painting fake
Vermeers, have you?

17:53.560 --> 17:56.560
Where did you get hundreds
of thousands of pounds from?

17:56.560 --> 17:58.200
A drug dealer.

17:58.200 --> 17:59.560
You fucking fuck!

17:59.560 --> 18:01.320
You stole money from a
drug dealer?!

18:01.320 --> 18:04.000
Now we're going to wind up in the
desert, digging our own graves!

18:04.000 --> 18:06.720
There are no deserts in England.
Well, then... Minehead Beach.

18:06.720 --> 18:08.760
I told you that it was dirty money.

18:08.760 --> 18:10.520
You still took it, though,
didn't you?

18:10.520 --> 18:13.480
You took it? Not just me. Them too.

18:13.480 --> 18:16.480
So j-just return the money, then.

18:16.480 --> 18:18.080
What?

18:18.080 --> 18:20.320
We, uh...we spent it.

18:20.320 --> 18:24.560
You've already spent hundreds
of thousands of pounds?

18:24.560 --> 18:26.440
I didn't.

18:26.440 --> 18:28.440
OK, at least one of us isn't
a total idiot.

18:28.440 --> 18:30.400
My grandson stole my cut.

18:30.400 --> 18:32.560
I withdraw my last remark.

18:32.560 --> 18:34.480
Did...did you spend yours, too?

18:34.480 --> 18:35.760
They didn't give me any money.

18:35.760 --> 18:37.880
They just blackmailed me into
washing it for them.

18:37.880 --> 18:40.760
What does that mean? Is that
getting the fingerprints off?

18:40.760 --> 18:44.400
It means you launder it so it looks
like it was earned legally.

18:44.400 --> 18:46.920
Don't kids in Britain learn
this stuff?

18:46.920 --> 18:49.480
I can't believe I'm the only person
who didn't know about this.

18:49.480 --> 18:51.480
You're not the only one.

18:51.480 --> 18:53.560
Hey, guys, what are we
talking about?

18:53.560 --> 18:55.440
Laundry.

18:55.440 --> 18:58.440
Cool. So, I don't know how familiar
you guys are

18:58.440 --> 19:01.920
with the movement of the Sun, but
tomorrow night is the Solstice.

19:01.920 --> 19:05.240
So, I am heading to Ergo,
and I want you all there, OK?

19:05.240 --> 19:06.920
Diane is in. Not to be missed, then.

19:06.920 --> 19:08.400
Drinks are on me, no excuses.

19:08.400 --> 19:11.040
Come on. Let's get ancient.

19:14.800 --> 19:16.600
What are we going to do?!

19:16.600 --> 19:18.120
We could pop down for one drink.

19:18.120 --> 19:20.680
Not the club, the drug dealer!

19:20.680 --> 19:24.680
Have you heard of a con called
The Sasquatch Patsy?

19:27.440 --> 19:29.960
No.
What do they teach in your schools?

19:32.760 --> 19:34.480
Ah!

19:58.400 --> 19:59.960
My keys are gone.

19:59.960 --> 20:01.480
Have you looked in your bag?

20:01.480 --> 20:03.040
They're not in there.

20:03.040 --> 20:04.560
My man.

20:04.560 --> 20:06.800
What about your pockets?

20:06.800 --> 20:09.680
Why are things always in
the last place you look?

20:09.680 --> 20:12.480
Thank you. Because you stop looking
after you find them.

20:12.480 --> 20:14.800
Grandpa is going to take you
to school today,

20:14.800 --> 20:16.400
so just give me a hug.

20:16.400 --> 20:18.760
Or don't. And learn lots. Mwah!

20:18.760 --> 20:20.280
Bye. Bye.

20:20.280 --> 20:21.520
Bye.

20:21.520 --> 20:23.000
Thank you. Learn lots.

20:50.120 --> 20:53.000
Lesley. Did we arrange a meeting?

20:53.000 --> 20:55.320
Please sit down, Mr Halloran.

21:12.040 --> 21:14.680
Bye-bye, Grandpa.
Have a wonderful day.

22:29.120 --> 22:31.440
Your father has decided that
Halloran & Son

22:31.440 --> 22:34.360
will sell a minority share to
Hilgard Auto Friction.

22:34.360 --> 22:37.000
Well, hallelujah. You've finally
seen the light, Dad.

22:37.000 --> 22:39.440
Your father will remain as CEO,

22:39.440 --> 22:43.400
but there will be some
workforce optimisation.

22:43.400 --> 22:47.040
I'm here to tell you this is
your final day of employment.

22:47.040 --> 22:48.080
What?

22:49.080 --> 22:51.640
What did she say?
Are you firing me?

22:51.640 --> 22:54.040
Your father feels it's in everyone's
best interests

22:54.040 --> 22:57.640
for you to step away from
Halloran & Son.

22:57.640 --> 23:00.800
Step away from Halloran & Son?!

23:01.920 --> 23:03.280
I'm the Son!

23:03.280 --> 23:06.240
It's vital you don't make
this personal. Is it? OK.

23:08.240 --> 23:10.520
That's fine, because I'm also
company director,

23:10.520 --> 23:13.000
so you can't do this.

23:13.000 --> 23:16.200
The power to remove a director is
granted to the majority shareholders

23:16.200 --> 23:18.520
under the company's
Articles of Association.

23:18.520 --> 23:19.800
I hired you!

23:19.800 --> 23:21.280
I'm employed by the company.

23:23.360 --> 23:24.760
What's...? What are you doing?

23:24.760 --> 23:26.520
What's going...? This is crazy.

23:26.520 --> 23:28.280
What are you doing? I'm your son!

23:28.280 --> 23:29.800
You're making this personal.

23:29.800 --> 23:32.120
Shut up! Don't raise
your voice to a woman.

23:32.120 --> 23:34.480
I'm s-sorry. Sorry.

23:36.640 --> 23:38.000
Why are you doing this?

23:39.720 --> 23:42.920
I forced you into the family trade.

23:44.680 --> 23:46.760
But you're out of your depth.

23:46.760 --> 23:48.080
I blame myself.

23:49.560 --> 23:51.480
Don't take it personally.

23:51.480 --> 23:52.880
It's just business.

24:14.160 --> 24:15.720
Sir. Hi. Um...

24:16.920 --> 24:18.480
..could I ask you a question?

24:18.480 --> 24:20.040
Yeah?

24:20.040 --> 24:22.440
How do you pay off a mortgage?

24:26.640 --> 24:29.000
You put this in the recycling bin?

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
Yeah. How fucking dumb are you?

24:31.000 --> 24:32.520
This can't be recycled.

24:32.520 --> 24:35.440
Bro, it's cardboard.
Murked in grease and cheese.

24:35.440 --> 24:38.640
Did you not watch the YouTube video
I pinged out to you about this?

24:38.640 --> 24:41.960
Tramps like you are the reason
the planet is dying.

24:41.960 --> 24:44.160
And why didn't you wash my car
like I done told you?

24:44.160 --> 24:46.080
Fam, I'm not your PA. For real.

24:46.080 --> 24:49.160
A PA would have initiative
and at least one GCSE.

24:49.160 --> 24:50.760
Go put this in the proper bin.

24:50.760 --> 24:52.320
And the door opens inwards,

24:52.320 --> 24:55.000
so remember to not hit yourself
in the face this time.

25:02.600 --> 25:04.320
What the fuck are you doing here?

25:04.320 --> 25:05.800
I'm bringing you a peace offering.

25:05.800 --> 25:07.440
Is it that fat stack of cash
you took?

25:07.440 --> 25:08.960
No.

25:08.960 --> 25:10.360
It's him.

25:10.360 --> 25:12.320
Hiya.

25:12.320 --> 25:15.320
It's nice to see you again.

25:15.320 --> 25:17.640
Why are you bringing this
googly-eyed plank to my house?

25:17.640 --> 25:18.880
Bit rude, innit?

25:18.880 --> 25:20.680
He's a lawyer. I've got a lawyer.

25:20.680 --> 25:23.400
Yes, but I suspect your lawyer
probably costs about £150 an hour,

25:23.400 --> 25:25.040
which means by the time you go
to court

25:25.040 --> 25:27.200
for having sent him to do your
community service,

25:27.200 --> 25:28.960
you could be looking at a
ten grand bill.

25:28.960 --> 25:31.880
Whereas his services
will be free of charge,

25:31.880 --> 25:34.120
if we stop this beef and we start
working together.

25:34.120 --> 25:35.240
And do what?

25:35.240 --> 25:36.600
Get the Dean off our backs.

25:36.600 --> 25:39.800
What's stopping me from taking you
to the Dean right now?

25:39.800 --> 25:41.480
Um, if I could take that one?

25:41.480 --> 25:43.160
If anything happens to either of us,

25:43.160 --> 25:45.320
then my associates will make contact
with the Dean

25:45.320 --> 25:47.200
and explain to him how you
tried to...

25:47.200 --> 25:49.640
Um, what was it again?

25:49.640 --> 25:52.240
How you tried to fuck him
with his own dick.

25:52.240 --> 25:54.880
Which, uh... I don't imagine
he will like.

26:29.200 --> 26:30.920
Guess who's back.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.400
Man, not again!

26:34.400 --> 26:36.320
How do I contact the Dean?

26:36.320 --> 26:37.720
How do I contact him?!

26:39.280 --> 26:40.840
You've got a set of balls
on you, mate,

26:40.840 --> 26:43.320
I'll tell you that for nothing.
Yeah? Thanks.

26:43.320 --> 26:45.440
Means a lot coming from you.

26:47.400 --> 26:49.680
Yes? Someone wants to talk to you.

26:49.680 --> 26:52.560
He's got a gun to my head, man!

26:52.560 --> 26:55.120
Who's this? Are you the Dean?

26:55.120 --> 26:56.840
Who wants to know?

26:56.840 --> 26:58.520
The arsehole that stole his money.

27:00.040 --> 27:01.280
You've got some big balls.

27:01.280 --> 27:03.360
Yeah? So I keep hearing.

27:03.360 --> 27:06.560
You're the worst thing to happen
to my business since Covid.

27:06.560 --> 27:08.000
What do you want?

27:08.000 --> 27:10.680
I'm just telling you to call off
your attack dogs.

27:10.680 --> 27:12.520
Isn't he in on this with you?

27:12.520 --> 27:14.280
Nah. Nah, I work alone.

27:14.280 --> 27:16.920
You know, I will find you.

27:16.920 --> 27:19.760
You never heard what happened to
a Brook Hill soldier called Spider?

27:19.760 --> 27:23.200
I heard he got heartburn that put
him in the hospital. Was that you?

27:23.200 --> 27:24.720
Yeah, man, that was me.

27:24.720 --> 27:27.640
And the same goes for anyone you
send that tries to look for me.

27:27.640 --> 27:30.200
But as a show of good faith,

27:30.200 --> 27:33.200
I'm going to leave your
line here.

27:33.200 --> 27:35.760
Yeah? For you to collect at your
own convenience.

27:35.760 --> 27:37.560
Tell him it's there.
Tell him it's there.

27:37.560 --> 27:39.840
Yeah, it's there,
he's telling the truth.

27:39.840 --> 27:41.560
You'll get no more trouble from me

27:41.560 --> 27:43.520
if I get no more trouble from you.

27:43.520 --> 27:44.960
Do we have a deal?

27:47.600 --> 27:49.120
We do.

28:01.480 --> 28:03.080
Thank you.

28:03.080 --> 28:04.240
Close your eyes.

28:04.240 --> 28:06.400
What? Close your fucking eyes!

28:06.400 --> 28:09.400
Wait! There's no need for you to do
this! I haven't done anything wrong!

28:09.400 --> 28:11.560
They just came here, man!
I didn't ask for it, mate!

28:11.560 --> 28:12.840
Come on, I've just got a dog!

28:12.840 --> 28:14.400
Please, man, don't do...

28:26.520 --> 28:28.520
Thank you.

28:28.520 --> 28:30.920
You're a free man now, Frank. Yep.

28:30.920 --> 28:33.000
You can leave any time you want.

28:33.000 --> 28:36.320
Yeah, but Grandpa is going to stay
right here with us, aren't you, Dad?

28:36.320 --> 28:38.240
That's right. Forever and ever!

28:38.240 --> 28:41.640
How would you like to spend your
first night of freedom, Dad?

28:41.640 --> 28:44.640
Would you like meatloaf?
That's your favourite, right?

28:44.640 --> 28:46.680
Meatloaf, that would be wonderful,

28:46.680 --> 28:49.600
but I've been dreaming of sitting in

28:49.600 --> 28:52.760
a bar with a cool glass of beer.

28:52.760 --> 28:56.600
How would you feel if I stepped out
and, you know, wet my tonsils?

28:56.600 --> 28:59.040
I'd feel fine, I don't know
how to make meatloaf.

29:00.760 --> 29:02.280
Goodbye.

29:30.640 --> 29:31.720
Got it.

29:39.520 --> 29:42.040
Mum. What are you doing here?

29:42.040 --> 29:44.760
You forgot Mr Snuggles.

29:44.760 --> 29:46.720
You know you can't sleep
without him.

29:46.720 --> 29:48.560
Yes, I can.

29:48.560 --> 29:51.920
So, this is where you live now?

29:51.920 --> 29:53.120
Yep.

29:53.120 --> 29:55.320
I thought you were
living with a boy.

29:55.320 --> 29:58.840
I'm not living with a boy,
I'm just staying here until...

30:00.440 --> 30:01.760
Until what?

30:04.560 --> 30:07.960
Look, we all said things
that we didn't mean,

30:07.960 --> 30:09.240
but your father and I,

30:09.240 --> 30:11.840
we are willing to draw a line
under everything.

30:11.840 --> 30:13.640
So why don't you
just come back home?

30:13.640 --> 30:16.360
You can finish your studies,
you can take your place at Oxford.

30:16.360 --> 30:19.680
How many times do I have to say
I don't want to go to Oxford?

30:19.680 --> 30:21.120
But I don't understand why not!

30:21.120 --> 30:23.360
Because it's your dream.
It's not my dream, Mum.

30:23.360 --> 30:25.600
So what are you going to do
with your life?

30:25.600 --> 30:27.480
You going to go out
and get some crappy job

30:27.480 --> 30:29.840
and come home every night
to, what, this dump?!

30:40.440 --> 30:41.920
This used to be our thing.

30:41.920 --> 30:45.320
Every Friday night, get a takeaway
and watch Graham Norton.

30:48.680 --> 30:50.120
Come home.

30:52.880 --> 30:54.640
Thanks for bringing Mr Snuggles.

31:39.240 --> 31:41.280
How did it go?

31:41.280 --> 31:43.760
Yeah. We're all good now.

31:43.760 --> 31:45.320
Really?

31:46.480 --> 31:48.080
Thank God.

31:48.080 --> 31:49.600
What are you doing here?

31:49.600 --> 31:52.240
I thought I'd come in the club.

31:52.240 --> 31:54.800
Yeah? Yeah, it's a
Friday night, baby.

31:54.800 --> 31:59.080
What else am I going to do? Stay
inside and watch Graham Norton?

31:59.080 --> 32:02.480
Stop the press! You came!

32:02.480 --> 32:05.720
Oh, hi! Oh, come on, let's go in.

32:05.720 --> 32:08.960
Look after her, yeah?
It's her first time in a club.

32:41.320 --> 32:43.800
You're late. I got here at 7pm.

32:43.800 --> 32:46.080
People don't normally come
to nightclubs that early.

32:46.080 --> 32:47.920
Yeah, I know, so I discovered.

32:47.920 --> 32:51.320
I just spent an hour watching them
scrape the gum off the dance floor.

32:51.320 --> 32:53.640
Oh, no, thank you,
I don't drink alcohol.

32:53.640 --> 32:55.680
Why? Is it because you're a Muslim?

32:55.680 --> 32:57.240
I'm not a Muslim.

32:57.240 --> 32:59.960
No? Why don't you drink alcohol?

32:59.960 --> 33:01.680
Uh... Babe, no friend of mine

33:01.680 --> 33:04.800
is going to their grave having not
tried champagne. Drink.

33:10.360 --> 33:11.600
Mm.

33:11.600 --> 33:14.400
It's, like, bubbly.

33:14.400 --> 33:16.040
That's its nickname.

33:20.760 --> 33:22.560
I think I like champagne.

33:22.560 --> 33:23.840
Oh, woo!

33:24.840 --> 33:26.160
G-Dog!

33:30.240 --> 33:31.480
Champagne?

33:31.480 --> 33:33.600
Oh, cheers. Woo!

33:33.600 --> 33:35.400
Well, cheers, everyone.

33:35.400 --> 33:36.720
Cheers!

33:50.880 --> 33:52.200
Place your bets.

34:05.760 --> 34:06.960
Hi.

34:16.160 --> 34:17.600
Thank you.

34:51.720 --> 34:53.960
Whoa! No, sweetie.

34:53.960 --> 34:56.360
Ha! You've just had your
first drink,

34:56.360 --> 34:58.720
let's not run before we can walk.

34:58.720 --> 35:02.000
Can we? Oh, yeah, just...just
whatever you want, put it on my tab.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.360
You promised you were going to
cut down on your spending.

35:04.360 --> 35:05.960
They're my friends.

35:09.200 --> 35:12.280
Greg, isn't that your lady
from work?

35:12.280 --> 35:14.560
It is, yeah.

35:14.560 --> 35:16.360
Oh, hello, she's coming over.

35:16.360 --> 35:17.680
What do I do?

35:17.680 --> 35:19.360
Be cool and say hi.

35:19.360 --> 35:22.160
Hey, you. Hi! Oh...

35:38.120 --> 35:40.040
That's fine.

35:40.040 --> 35:41.640
What are you doing here?

35:41.640 --> 35:43.080
Erm, hen do.

35:43.080 --> 35:44.680
Oh, yeah. No, it is...

35:46.520 --> 35:47.800
It's hot in here, isn't it?

35:47.800 --> 35:49.200
It is hot. It is a bit hot, yeah.

35:49.200 --> 35:51.520
I hope it doesn't create humid
crotch conditions

35:51.520 --> 35:55.240
that could lead to a build-up of
fungus in my vaginal cavity.

35:56.840 --> 35:58.440
Oh!

35:58.440 --> 36:00.560
Right, yeah, do you remember when we
were in the lift

36:00.560 --> 36:02.520
and I was talking about her
fanny, her...?

36:02.520 --> 36:06.400
Um... Can I ask you something
that's, er, sort of embarrassing?

36:06.400 --> 36:08.560
OK, sure.

36:08.560 --> 36:11.600
Could we get a picture
with Lady Gabby?

36:11.600 --> 36:13.720
Oh, yeah. Yeah, hang on.

36:15.160 --> 36:17.000
Is it all right if Anne-Marie and
her friends

36:17.000 --> 36:18.280
have a photo with you, please?

36:18.280 --> 36:20.680
Also, she probably thinks you
and me are dating.

36:20.680 --> 36:22.040
I don't think she does, sweetie.

36:22.040 --> 36:25.080
She probably does, so can you make
it clear that we're not an item?

36:27.000 --> 36:29.200
Hi, I'm Gabby, I'm a lesbian.

36:29.200 --> 36:30.680
OK. Hello again.

36:30.680 --> 36:32.520
Hi. So, I'm happy to have a picture
with you,

36:32.520 --> 36:34.080
but would you do me a favour
in return?

36:34.080 --> 36:36.080
Oh. Yeah, sure, w-w-what's that?

36:36.080 --> 36:38.880
Would you go on a date with my
platonic friend Greg here?

36:38.880 --> 36:41.000
You don't need to do that
if you don't want.

36:42.200 --> 36:43.960
Oh!

36:43.960 --> 36:45.320
Come on.

36:46.640 --> 36:47.800
Look who's here!

36:47.800 --> 36:50.360
She's coming! Hi! Hi, Gabby!

36:51.360 --> 36:53.600
All right, everyone smile.

37:00.640 --> 37:02.480
Oh, he's here at last.

37:07.160 --> 37:09.880
Where have you been?
Everyone's here.

37:13.800 --> 37:15.800
Would you excuse me for just
one minute?

37:20.240 --> 37:22.760
I expect he's gone to
wash his hands.

37:57.040 --> 37:59.160
What do I do instead of Oxford?

37:59.160 --> 38:02.960
Like, in theory, you know,
I can do anything,

38:02.960 --> 38:06.880
but, you know, man is nothing
without which he makes himself.

38:06.880 --> 38:08.520
Jean-Paul Sartre.

38:08.520 --> 38:11.880
With great power comes
great responsibility.

38:11.880 --> 38:13.640
Spider-man.

38:13.640 --> 38:18.840
Exactly. There's so much I
haven't done or...experienced.

38:19.920 --> 38:21.520
Don't tell anyone, but...

38:22.560 --> 38:24.880
..I'm still a virgin.

38:24.880 --> 38:26.320
Understood.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.320
No, no, no.
I don't need one of those.

38:31.320 --> 38:33.280
Yeah, I used to have that attitude,

38:33.280 --> 38:35.200
and then I got super gonorrhoea.

38:35.200 --> 38:37.000
Front and back.

38:37.000 --> 38:39.800
No, I mean I'm not having
sex tonight.

38:39.800 --> 38:42.640
Oh. Why? Cos you're Muslim?

38:42.640 --> 38:44.240
I'm not a Muslim.

38:44.240 --> 38:46.920
No? Well, what are you waiting
for, then?

38:46.920 --> 38:48.200
I don't know.

38:48.200 --> 38:49.440
Well, a lot of guys here.

38:49.440 --> 38:51.800
Any of them making your
fanny fairies flutter?

38:54.440 --> 38:56.160
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

38:56.160 --> 38:57.880
He's kind of cute.

38:57.880 --> 39:00.120
Yeah?
Yeah, not bad, yeah...

39:05.840 --> 39:08.120
Do you like sexual intercourse
with women?

39:08.120 --> 39:09.240
Yeah.

39:09.240 --> 39:11.840
Good. I want to notify you that we

39:11.840 --> 39:14.600
are both available sexually, OK?

39:14.600 --> 39:17.240
I don't do tea-bagging,
golden showers,

39:17.240 --> 39:19.880
or reverse anal, but anything else
is up for grabs.

39:19.880 --> 39:22.440
My friend here, however,
is new to the market,

39:22.440 --> 39:26.960
so I want her to be treated
with care and respect, all right?

39:26.960 --> 39:30.560
And I've got the direct line to
Detective Sergeant Lucy Haines

39:30.560 --> 39:32.920
of the Bristol and
Avon Constabulary,

39:32.920 --> 39:36.600
so any funny business -
ANY funny business -

39:36.600 --> 39:39.560
and you will be prosecuted to
the full extent of the law.

39:39.560 --> 39:42.480
Understood? Understood?

39:42.480 --> 39:44.360
Yes, ma'am.

39:44.360 --> 39:45.640
Good.

39:45.640 --> 39:48.240
We'll be sat here
if you want to get some.

39:48.240 --> 39:49.560
Go.

40:02.320 --> 40:05.000
Didn't picture
you two as club rats.

40:05.000 --> 40:08.840
Just needed to get out of the house.
Just needed to get out of my flat.

40:10.720 --> 40:13.400
Gabby, can I throw these on your
tab? Yeah, yeah, yeah, go ahead.

40:13.400 --> 40:16.680
Perfect. Brilliant. Um,
can I grab two more of those?

40:16.680 --> 40:19.320
Do you know all of these people
you're buying drinks for?

40:19.320 --> 40:21.160
Greg, I've told you,
they're my friends.

40:21.160 --> 40:22.320
What's his name?

40:22.320 --> 40:24.080
James. No, Jason.

40:24.080 --> 40:25.960
Jeremy?

40:25.960 --> 40:27.360
Definitely begins with a J.

40:27.360 --> 40:30.000
Julian. His name's Julian.
Excuse me, mate, what's your name?

40:30.000 --> 40:31.240
Roy.

40:32.760 --> 40:33.880
What's your point?

40:33.880 --> 40:36.720
Is it possible that they're not your
actual friends?

40:36.720 --> 40:38.280
Why are they here, then?

40:38.280 --> 40:41.560
Because they're moochers.
Sucking on the Gabby teat.

40:41.560 --> 40:44.840
If any of my friends
are sucking on my teats,

40:44.840 --> 40:47.560
it's you, Mr £150 An Hour.

40:47.560 --> 40:49.960
I'm not your friend, I'm your
lawyer. It's different.

40:49.960 --> 40:51.120
You're not my friend?

40:51.120 --> 40:53.360
Well, no, of course I'm your friend,
I just mean...

40:53.360 --> 40:54.800
I was fixing you up with Anne-Marie

40:54.800 --> 40:56.440
because I thought you were
my friend.

40:56.440 --> 40:59.560
I don't normally help
my employees get laid.

40:59.560 --> 41:01.000
Well, I didn't ask you to do that.

41:01.000 --> 41:04.360
Well, fine, let's make a cost saving
now, shall we? You're fired!

41:04.360 --> 41:07.760
Gabby, come on!
One less mooch sucking on my teat.

41:07.760 --> 41:09.760
Happy now?

41:09.760 --> 41:11.480
You're not serious. Deadly serious!

41:11.480 --> 41:13.360
Go on, get out of here, mooch!

41:22.240 --> 41:24.120
I don't need your money!

41:24.120 --> 41:27.400
Go on, mooch!
Thank you and goodnight!

42:18.360 --> 42:19.800
Shit.

42:23.360 --> 42:26.520
Incapable
by Roisin Murphy

42:38.840 --> 42:40.200
How did it go?

42:40.200 --> 42:42.640
Yeah, I did what you said and
he seemed to buy it.

42:42.640 --> 42:43.880
Will it work?

42:43.880 --> 42:46.040
Sasquatch Patsy never fails.

42:47.320 --> 42:48.480
Going somewhere?

42:48.480 --> 42:50.480
I'm on the early flight to Rio.

42:50.480 --> 42:52.920
Huh? De Janeiro.

42:52.920 --> 42:54.120
Oh, you're leaving?

42:54.120 --> 42:55.920
Yep. Got a few hours to kill,

42:55.920 --> 42:59.960
then cabbing direct to
Heathrow Airport.

42:59.960 --> 43:02.320
Could you let me know when
my ride arrives?

43:02.320 --> 43:03.760
Yeah, sure.

43:03.760 --> 43:05.840
One more favour.

43:05.840 --> 43:08.400
Deliver this to my daughter.

43:08.400 --> 43:09.800
What is that?

43:09.800 --> 43:12.520
It's £1,000, huh?

43:12.520 --> 43:15.000
50 for your trouble.

43:15.000 --> 43:18.680
I mean, you could've given that to
her yourself before you left.

43:18.680 --> 43:22.160
I prefer what they call
the Dignitas farewell.

43:22.160 --> 43:24.040
Slip away, no fuss.

43:24.040 --> 43:28.040
It's none of my business but if you
take off without saying goodbye,

43:28.040 --> 43:31.480
aren't you worried your daughter's
going to hate you for it?

43:31.480 --> 43:33.040
Yeah, you're right.

43:34.680 --> 43:36.600
It's none of your business.

43:41.720 --> 43:43.960
Frank, you made it!

43:43.960 --> 43:47.160
Hi! Come and dance with me!

43:47.160 --> 43:48.520
Are you drunk?

43:48.520 --> 43:50.400
Yeah, and I love it.

43:50.400 --> 43:53.000
Gabs, I told you to look after her.
She's wasted!

43:53.000 --> 43:54.520
Didn't you hear her? She loves it!

43:54.520 --> 43:56.480
I love it!

43:57.640 --> 43:59.120
Oh!

44:04.600 --> 44:06.120
Diane!

44:08.280 --> 44:10.560
Look at you, Diane! Woo!

44:14.760 --> 44:16.680
Uh, can you settle up the tab?

44:16.680 --> 44:19.040
Yeah, sure. Hang on.

44:19.040 --> 44:21.040
Thank you.

44:22.120 --> 44:24.000
Oh, it's been declined.

44:24.000 --> 44:25.280
What?

44:28.920 --> 44:30.280
It didn't work either.

44:32.880 --> 44:34.440
Uh, guys...

44:34.440 --> 44:36.840
..I think my dad has
cancelled my credit cards.

44:36.840 --> 44:38.040
Has anyone got any money?

44:38.040 --> 44:40.360
Oh, sorry, babe. No.

44:40.360 --> 44:42.920
No. Sorry. Are you certain, mate?

44:42.920 --> 44:44.960
Fuck.

44:44.960 --> 44:48.960
Shit. My dad is such an arsehole.

44:48.960 --> 44:50.680
Let me get this.

44:50.680 --> 44:51.960
Thank you.

44:51.960 --> 44:54.120
Oh, Frank, you absolute angel!

44:54.120 --> 44:55.360
Thank you.

44:55.360 --> 44:56.640
God, I wish you were my dad.

44:56.640 --> 44:59.640
Who leaves their only daughter
high and dry at one in the morning?

44:59.640 --> 45:01.400
God!

45:01.400 --> 45:03.040
Dick.

45:13.840 --> 45:15.760
Which one is ours?

45:16.760 --> 45:18.040
This way. Oh, OK.

45:18.040 --> 45:19.080
This way. Go on.

45:19.080 --> 45:21.000
I'm focused on the car.

45:21.000 --> 45:24.400
Right, whoa, whoa, whoa.
It's all right. No need to argue.

45:24.400 --> 45:25.640
We're all going to get a turn.

45:25.640 --> 45:28.440
We just need to rock-paper-scissors
for who goes first, all right?

45:28.440 --> 45:30.240
And we need a safe word, yeah?

45:37.840 --> 45:39.880
I've got you down for
Heathrow Airport.

45:39.880 --> 45:40.960
Is that right, mate?

45:43.440 --> 45:45.000
Mate?

45:45.000 --> 45:46.600
Where do you want to go?

45:47.880 --> 45:49.280
Whoa...!

45:50.720 --> 45:54.280
Kind sir, I...I do like you.

45:54.280 --> 45:58.320
Relax. Woo! Oh, God.

45:58.320 --> 46:02.160
I think you should be going to sleep
alone, Rani. I don't think so.

46:02.160 --> 46:05.000
I think we should sleep together.

46:05.000 --> 46:06.560
Goodnight, Rani.

46:06.560 --> 46:09.200
Look. So much room.

46:09.200 --> 46:10.800
Come back.

46:41.000 --> 46:42.600
Dad!

46:42.600 --> 46:45.840
You utter scumbucket, piece of shit,

46:45.840 --> 46:48.600
wanker, bastard, arsehole...

46:48.600 --> 46:51.600
..shit!

47:00.600 --> 47:02.040
Where's the money, Frank?

47:04.480 --> 47:06.720
I know you found it, but
what have you done with it?

47:18.000 --> 47:19.480
Dad, are you just getting home?

47:19.480 --> 47:21.520
Margie, I'm sorry,
I lost track of time.

47:21.520 --> 47:24.640
Well, I'll be honest, I did, erm,
start worrying that

47:24.640 --> 47:25.960
you'd left us again.

47:25.960 --> 47:28.440
No, Margie, I'm here
for the long haul.

47:28.440 --> 47:31.120
In fact, around here it's
about time I contributed.

47:32.400 --> 47:35.240
How about I start by
paying off your mortgage?

47:35.240 --> 47:37.160
Sorrym that is...

47:37.160 --> 47:40.120
..that's really sweet but, I mean,
you can't even pay a parking ticket.

47:40.120 --> 47:41.360
Yeah?

47:48.240 --> 47:49.880
Where did you get all this money?

47:49.880 --> 47:52.680
For once in my life,
I'm going to come clean.

47:57.920 --> 47:59.840
I won it.

47:59.840 --> 48:01.120
Casino.

48:07.680 --> 48:09.640
Oh, Frank!

48:27.960 --> 48:29.040
You're drunk.

48:29.040 --> 48:30.200
No, I'm not.

48:31.400 --> 48:33.400
That's what drunk people say.

48:33.400 --> 48:35.680
No, I'm sober.

48:35.680 --> 48:37.040
I promise.

48:43.880 --> 48:48.600
All Time
by A.S. Fanning

49:00.760 --> 49:02.480
Is that...

49:02.480 --> 49:04.760
..Raphael or Donatello...?

49:04.760 --> 49:06.880
Yeah, that's my guy Donnie.

49:06.880 --> 49:08.720
Ninja Turtles.

49:08.720 --> 49:10.520
What? OK.

49:10.520 --> 49:12.040
What's...? What? Don't judge me.

49:12.040 --> 49:14.040
No. It's all good.
You know they're wavy.

49:14.040 --> 49:16.120
Yep. Very wavy.

49:19.560 --> 49:21.240
Wait.

49:21.240 --> 49:22.920
Are you sure you want to do this?

49:22.920 --> 49:24.080
Yeah.

49:24.080 --> 49:25.440
No, are you sure?

49:27.520 --> 49:28.800
Yes.

49:29.840 --> 49:31.280
Where did you get that?

49:31.280 --> 49:32.760
Diane.

49:32.760 --> 49:35.960
Please don't talk about
Diane right now!

49:35.960 --> 49:40.040
♪ You know I'm happy to

Ugh, so my dad has

49:55.000 --> 49:57.080
and I don't have anywhere
to sleep tonight

49:57.080 --> 49:59.440
and, look, I know you've got
that spare room...

49:59.440 --> 50:01.760
No, I did not nearly burn down
the flat last time!

50:01.760 --> 50:04.360
I lit some tea candles
then went to Ibiza!

50:04.360 --> 50:06.320
Hi, is this Izzy's phone?

50:07.560 --> 50:09.440
Oh, my God, why is she in hospital?!

50:10.920 --> 50:12.400
Gallstones?

50:12.400 --> 50:15.120
So you're saying that you're not
happy sharing your flat

50:15.120 --> 50:17.480
but you are happy sharing
my cocaine all night?

50:17.480 --> 50:21.240
So if Izzy's in hospital, does that
mean her flat's empty tonight?

50:21.240 --> 50:23.960
Hey, you. It's Gabby Penrose-Howe.

50:23.960 --> 50:25.800
We slept together on New Year's Eve.

50:25.800 --> 50:28.440
Listen, look, I know I said
I'd call and I didn't,

50:28.440 --> 50:30.040
but I'm calling now.

50:30.040 --> 50:32.840
Fancy sleeping together
again tonight?

50:32.840 --> 50:34.240
Give me a call when you get this.

50:34.240 --> 50:35.440
Ciao!

50:35.440 --> 50:37.680
Hi, this is
Lady Gabriella Penrose-Howe.

50:37.680 --> 50:39.360
We met at the club earlier.

50:39.360 --> 50:42.320
I don't suppose you've got
a sofa or anything that

50:42.320 --> 50:44.920
I could crash on tonight?

50:44.920 --> 50:47.000
Oh, no, I got your name
from the receipt.

50:47.000 --> 50:49.680
Yeah, it's just under
suggested gratuity,

50:49.680 --> 50:54.760
which you may recall I did give you
in full, in cash.

51:08.760 --> 51:10.280
You OK?

51:10.280 --> 51:11.480
Yeah.

51:11.480 --> 51:13.200
Now I'm a woman of the world.

51:16.320 --> 51:19.400
You're wondering what all
the fuss was about?

51:19.400 --> 51:22.200
Actually, I'm thinking it was
worth waiting for.

51:23.560 --> 51:25.920
Thank you...for being...

51:25.920 --> 51:27.840
It's... Thank you.

51:31.400 --> 51:33.040
OK, fuck, fuck, fuck...!

51:34.480 --> 51:37.160
Esme... What were you doing
out so late?

51:37.160 --> 51:38.840
It's four in the morning.

51:38.840 --> 51:40.640
Esme, it's four...

51:52.560 --> 51:55.480
No!

52:11.120 --> 52:12.400
Hi.

52:12.400 --> 52:14.240
You were right.

52:14.240 --> 52:15.920
I have no real friends.

52:19.320 --> 52:21.440
I don't have anywhere else to go.

52:28.000 --> 52:30.200
You better come in, then.

52:30.200 --> 52:31.440
Thank you.

52:39.160 --> 52:41.280
I've had a gun pointed in
my face twice, yeah?

52:41.280 --> 52:43.200
Well, not again.

52:43.200 --> 52:44.440
I want to get clean, man.

52:44.440 --> 52:46.560
I want you to put me in rehab
and witness protection.

52:46.560 --> 52:47.640
Tell us what you know.

52:47.640 --> 52:50.720
I ain't saying nothing till I get
full immunity and rehoused,

52:50.720 --> 52:53.240
and I want to go somewhere nice,
you know, in the countryside,

52:53.240 --> 52:55.400
with fields and cows and shit.

52:55.400 --> 52:57.880
We can't ask our boss for
fields and cows and shit

52:57.880 --> 53:00.240
unless you give us something.

53:00.240 --> 53:03.400
Like the men who were serving up
from your house. Oh...

53:26.120 --> 53:28.200
Have you head of someone
called The Dean?

53:29.560 --> 53:31.880
Oh, bloody hell.
I thought you was detectives.

53:31.880 --> 53:33.760
Hey!

53:33.760 --> 53:35.360
Tell us about The Dean.

53:37.520 --> 53:40.240
The Dean runs county lines
into Bristol.

53:40.240 --> 53:43.880
For years he's been grooming
local kids to work for him.

53:45.280 --> 53:47.440
Well, from what I've heard,
he's a savage.

53:49.000 --> 53:50.880
And I mean proper psycho.

53:52.000 --> 53:53.840
Tea, anyone?

54:06.200 --> 54:08.480
You're Ben,

54:08.480 --> 54:09.960
nightclub doorman.

54:11.000 --> 54:12.880
And you're Rani,

54:12.880 --> 54:15.560
a brainbox with
a scholarship to Oxford.

54:15.560 --> 54:17.000
I know who you are.

54:17.000 --> 54:18.320
I know where you live.

54:18.320 --> 54:20.160
I know everything about you.

54:20.160 --> 54:22.000
Do you know who I am?

54:22.000 --> 54:23.040
No?

54:23.040 --> 54:27.560
I'm the person you stole that
impossible amount of money from.

54:27.560 --> 54:30.600
And somehow you assumed
I wouldn't find out.

54:30.600 --> 54:32.200
We never stole anything.

54:32.200 --> 54:33.520
He's right.

54:35.360 --> 54:38.600
Well, instead of me accusing you
and then you denying,

54:38.600 --> 54:41.080
why don't I bring my star witness
to the stand?

54:44.600 --> 54:47.400
What are you do...?
You sold me out, you prick?!

54:47.400 --> 54:49.400
What did you expect?

54:49.400 --> 54:51.000
You treat me like dirt.

54:51.000 --> 54:52.200
You show man no respect.

54:52.200 --> 54:53.560
Is this about the pizza box?

54:53.560 --> 54:56.080
I told you, you can't recycle them
when they're dirty, bruv.

54:56.080 --> 54:57.360
It's not just that, bro.

54:57.360 --> 54:58.760
You're small fry.

54:58.760 --> 55:01.040
There's no career progression
with you.

55:01.040 --> 55:02.280
I've hit a ceiling.

55:02.280 --> 55:05.000
Yeah? You hit a ceiling with
your head when you flew out

55:05.000 --> 55:07.920
your mum's gaping vagina.
That's why you're so fucking dumb!

55:07.920 --> 55:10.680
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

55:10.680 --> 55:12.760
Hey, relax.

55:12.760 --> 55:14.520
All right?

55:14.520 --> 55:16.360
Take a seat. Sit down.

55:23.600 --> 55:25.360
Put your feet up.

55:28.840 --> 55:30.200
Biscuit?

55:35.520 --> 55:37.280
I hate thieves.

55:37.280 --> 55:38.560
Do you know why?

55:38.560 --> 55:40.800
Because they're lazy.

55:40.800 --> 55:43.560
A businessman like myself
works hard for years,

55:43.560 --> 55:45.080
building a nest egg.

55:45.080 --> 55:48.320
And then some wanker who'd rather
sit on his arse that do

55:48.320 --> 55:53.200
a decent day's work thinks he can
just breeze in and take it all.

55:53.200 --> 55:54.320
Hmm?

55:55.600 --> 55:57.800
The only thing I hate
more than thieves...

56:00.920 --> 56:02.560
..are snitches.

56:02.560 --> 56:04.560
Snitches are like whores.

56:04.560 --> 56:08.200
They'll open their mouths
to anyone for the right price.

56:10.920 --> 56:13.240
You broke my leg, man! Yeah, I know.

56:13.240 --> 56:15.920
You broke my fucking leg! I know!

56:15.920 --> 56:17.400
I need a hospital, man!

56:17.400 --> 56:19.840
Yeah. Mile End Hospital is
a 20-minute walk.

56:19.840 --> 56:21.920
How am I meant to walk
with a broken leg?!

56:21.920 --> 56:23.520
Very slowly, I imagine.

56:23.520 --> 56:25.320
Fuck off, snitch!

56:28.880 --> 56:31.840
Now, just so there are no surprises,
let me just make myself

56:31.840 --> 56:33.640
very, very clear.

56:33.640 --> 56:36.640
One of you is
not leaving here alive.

56:36.640 --> 56:38.480
Ain't no need for all that, bro.

56:38.480 --> 56:40.640
But there is a need for that, bro,

56:40.640 --> 56:42.840
cos I need to set a fucking example.

56:42.840 --> 56:45.160
Stop! We'll give you the money back!

56:45.160 --> 56:46.480
We'll pay the money back!

56:46.480 --> 56:48.840
It's too late for that.
Please! We'll pay it back and more!
