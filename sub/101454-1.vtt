03:36.474 --> 03:37.677
Good morning.

03:47.854 --> 03:52.692

pedals, you'll feel like a teenager.

05:20.212 --> 05:24.050
Hey, Chabol.

05:59.318 --> 06:02.554
<i>We're just about to make

06:02.587 --> 06:05.024

Hey, Kiwi, will you take my bag?

07:28.407 --> 07:30.810
Please, Tartare,
just a few questions?

07:30.843 --> 07:32.244
5 minutes, Tartare.

07:32.278 --> 07:34.647
Any chance of an autograph?

07:34.680 --> 07:36.882
They say it is the most
grueling sporting event in the world.

07:36.916 --> 07:38.684
Do you think you have a chance of winning?
Should I put me money on ya?

07:38.717 --> 07:40.386
No, I'm a domestique.

07:40.419 --> 07:41.821
A what?

07:43.155 --> 07:45.858
I'm a domestique. I'm a support rider.
I'm not supposed to win.

07:45.891 --> 07:48.260
See that guy over there?
That's Tartare.

07:48.294 --> 07:52.131
That's our lead rider. He's gonna win.
You're gonna wanna get his autograph. Okay?

07:55.000 --> 07:57.770
- Have you got another one? It doesn't work.
- Don't worry about it.

08:02.808 --> 08:05.678
Two weeks ago I was nobody,
right now I'm famous in Ireland.

08:05.711 --> 08:08.247
- Who wants a look?
- I'll take a wee nosy, boss!

08:10.683 --> 08:12.952
Now gentlemen,
five plates of plain pasta?

08:12.985 --> 08:14.220
- That's us, darlin'.
- Yeah.

08:14.253 --> 08:17.156
A steak tartare
with a raw egg?

08:17.189 --> 08:20.326
- And a double cheeseburger with extra chips.
- The cheeseburger's mine.

08:32.203 --> 08:33.405
Hmm.

08:38.177 --> 08:40.779
Hmm. Mm.

08:41.847 --> 08:43.883
I go. I go.

08:43.916 --> 08:47.286
I cannot sit here with this, uh,
fat burger face.

08:48.988 --> 08:50.756
I'm on a pasta-free diet.

08:52.491 --> 08:54.026
What's funny?

08:54.059 --> 08:55.427
No, what's funny?
Why do you laughing?

08:56.829 --> 08:58.797
You remember when seeing
your name in the paper

08:58.831 --> 09:00.799
was enough to power you through
the whole tour.

09:06.505 --> 09:11.310
Look at you. Your first tour.
1979.

09:11.343 --> 09:13.312
I forgot you were a young
bastard once.

10:28.320 --> 10:29.855
Dom!

10:29.888 --> 10:30.756
Dom!

10:33.125 --> 10:35.227
- He wants some water.
- Just keep the pace, eh?

10:38.964 --> 10:40.199
Julio,?

10:43.302 --> 10:44.336
Okay.

10:46.338 --> 10:48.073
Kids are hungry.

10:48.107 --> 10:50.209
How are you doing, Sonny,
are you good?

10:50.242 --> 10:52.044
See you're smoking all the time
again, eh?

10:56.282 --> 10:57.449
Alright, Tone, you good?

10:59.351 --> 11:00.886
Oh, Jesus!

11:00.919 --> 11:02.855
Who knocked the froth off
his cappuccino?

11:11.930 --> 11:13.232
I should not do, I know.

11:14.166 --> 11:16.001
Hey. It's important job,
you know.

11:16.035 --> 11:19.338
Hey, look, I think my saddle
is little high, huh.

11:19.371 --> 11:21.173
It's important.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:22.474 --> 11:25.444
I make a joke,
so he was like serious,

11:25.477 --> 11:27.546
like, losing his mind,
so I tried to go.

11:27.579 --> 11:31.150
You did a good job.
When you're in finish line...

11:31.183 --> 11:33.085
- I go, I go.
- Okay.

11:33.118 --> 11:35.020
I will wear
the other shoes, okay?

11:35.054 --> 11:36.822
Yeah, take the other ones.
They'll be better.

11:40.893 --> 11:41.927
Viking.

11:43.595 --> 11:45.632
Viking.

11:45.665 --> 11:48.834
- I need to know about next year. My contract.
- Yeah.

11:53.038 --> 11:55.074
Let's just see
how you get on this year.

11:59.078 --> 12:01.380
Fuck him.
He's just playing hardball.

12:06.418 --> 12:09.355
You're part
of the furniture for fucks sake!

12:15.260 --> 12:17.596
Ah, hello, hey, Brad,
how's it going?

12:17.630 --> 12:21.934
Listen, I have a question for you
about, um... about next year and...

12:29.208 --> 12:32.978
Hello? I'm, uh... I'm thinking
about leaving Austrange.

12:35.047 --> 12:36.683
Yeah. No, I'm not gonna bother
you too long.

12:36.716 --> 12:40.085
I just wanted to, uh... Yeah,
no, Tartare... He's good.

12:40.119 --> 12:43.288
He's, uh... Yeah, he's in shape,
he's in shape.

12:43.322 --> 12:44.990
Well, I don't know what he's
gonna do next year, um...

13:36.108 --> 13:37.309
Alright, big man.

13:39.278 --> 13:41.013
- Hey, guys.
- Hey mate.

13:41.046 --> 13:44.349
- What's your blood tag, Kiwi?
- Um, Madame Foo-Foo.

13:44.383 --> 13:47.486
Madame Foo-Foo. Was your pet
a fuckin' drag queen?

13:47.519 --> 13:50.289
Shut the fuck up, mate!
Was my sister's Pekinese.

13:50.322 --> 13:52.759
Here you go, Madame Foo-Foo.

13:52.792 --> 13:56.663
- It's cold.
- All the better for boosting your blood, son.

13:56.696 --> 13:59.064
- Enzo.
- Milou.

13:59.097 --> 14:02.367
- Who's Milou when he's at home?
- You know, it's the dog from Tintin.

14:02.401 --> 14:05.437
Excuse me.
Tintin's dog was called Snowy.

14:05.471 --> 14:07.740
Well, in Portugal it was Milou.

14:09.341 --> 14:10.677
Hang on.

14:10.710 --> 14:12.745
I've got two bags
tagged with Milou here.

14:12.779 --> 14:15.113
- No, my dog was Milou.
- What?

14:15.147 --> 14:17.182
- It's my dog too.
- Are you after my blood, Enzo?

14:17.216 --> 14:19.652
- My dog was Milou.
- Oh, bloody hell.

14:19.686 --> 14:21.520
So, what do we do now?

14:21.553 --> 14:24.189
What's the worst that can happen
if we take the wrong blood?

14:24.223 --> 14:26.124
Let me see.

14:26.158 --> 14:28.594
You're the same blood type, so
small chance of complications.

14:28.628 --> 14:30.596
- Yeah, like what?
- Well, there's always a possibility

14:30.630 --> 14:32.531
- of an allergic reaction.
- And that's it?

14:32.564 --> 14:34.767
Like no other possible
side effects?

14:34.801 --> 14:38.303
No, the other possible side effect is,
if you don't take it, you won't win.

14:38.337 --> 14:40.372
Ah give me, give me, give me.

14:40.405 --> 14:41.573
So, oof...

14:44.576 --> 14:46.411
This is me.

14:46.445 --> 14:48.514
- This is me, this is me.
- What if it's not you?

14:48.547 --> 14:52.184
This is me, Enzo. I can feel
myself inside this bag. This is me.

14:52.217 --> 14:54.486
Think it's safer if I don't.
Okay?

14:54.520 --> 14:57.189
Go sit down and you take the blood.
What's the worst that can happen? Please!

14:59.659 --> 15:02.060
Well, I guess
that's settled then.

15:02.094 --> 15:04.263
- Now, Dom.
- Do you know, Sonny, that I'm Belgian.

15:04.296 --> 15:06.231
Tintin's dog's actually
called Bobby.

15:06.265 --> 15:09.601
Fascinating.
Absolutely, fucking fascinating.

18:42.447 --> 18:44.549
That should do ya.

18:44.583 --> 18:45.718
Thanks.

18:49.421 --> 18:50.957
How ya feeling?

18:50.990 --> 18:53.291
I need to see a doctor.

18:53.325 --> 18:55.360
Give Strocatti a call.
He's probably in his room.

18:55.393 --> 18:56.696
Sonny, not the team doctor.

18:58.497 --> 18:59.531
Are you okay?

19:01.100 --> 19:02.902
Just wanna get it checked.

19:02.935 --> 19:04.937
I don't want the whole team
to know about it.

19:04.971 --> 19:07.039
- Especially not Viking with the way he's been lately.
- Sure.

19:08.573 --> 19:10.475
I just wanna be 100% fit, okay?

19:11.744 --> 19:13.478
Leave it with me.

19:13.512 --> 19:14.546
Thanks.

19:17.616 --> 19:18.651
One more time.

19:22.420 --> 19:23.488
Okay.

19:29.662 --> 19:30.696
Okay.

19:30.730 --> 19:32.330
Ah.

19:33.598 --> 19:34.499
Ah...

19:34.533 --> 19:35.968
Okay. You can relax.

19:38.938 --> 19:41.107
Well, your chest sounds clear.

19:41.140 --> 19:44.110
Your heartrate is pretty low
but you are an athlete.

19:44.143 --> 19:46.478
How long have you had it?

19:46.511 --> 19:49.782
Um, for about a week. I wake up
coughing and then feel like I'm choking.

19:49.816 --> 19:51.483
Any other symptoms?

19:51.516 --> 19:55.387
Uh, dizziness. Uh, shivering.

19:55.420 --> 19:57.556
Sweat when I wake up.

19:57.589 --> 19:59.357
That's strange 'cause they're all flu
symptoms but I don't think it's the flu.

19:59.391 --> 20:01.093
Can I ask you about your diet?

20:01.127 --> 20:05.463
Um, it's limited.
Protein and carbs on races.

20:05.497 --> 20:07.465
Well your immune system
may be low.

20:07.499 --> 20:10.569
It's hard to fight infection
with an imbalanced diet.

20:10.602 --> 20:13.139
You might have caught a little
virus here in Ireland.

20:13.172 --> 20:17.109
With a virus you just have to ride it
out, if you'll excuse the pun.

20:18.177 --> 20:22.581
Uh, the UCI gave me one of these
while I'm working for them.

20:22.614 --> 20:24.884
So I'll give you my number.

20:24.917 --> 20:27.452
If things get bad, just, um...

20:28.754 --> 20:30.823
just give me a call.

20:30.857 --> 20:33.893
- Thanks.
- And, uh, be no harm to see a nutritionist after the race.

20:33.926 --> 20:35.594
Just help build you up.

20:37.596 --> 20:38.965
Listen, um...

20:40.565 --> 20:43.002
Dr. Lynn Brennan, would you mind not
telling anybody about this meeting please?

20:43.035 --> 20:44.937
I just don't want
the team to know.

20:44.971 --> 20:47.106
Patient doctor confidentiality
prevents that Mr...

20:47.139 --> 20:48.506
- Dom.
- Mr. Dom.

20:48.540 --> 20:50.009
- Dominique Chabol.
- Okay.

20:53.445 --> 20:54.546
Sonny.

20:56.082 --> 20:58.483
- Thanks for doing that, Lynn.
- Sure, no problem.

20:58.516 --> 21:00.019
- See you around.
- See ya.

21:00.052 --> 21:01.087
Thanks.

21:03.022 --> 21:04.056
All good?

21:05.523 --> 21:07.760
- Where'd you find her?
- Nice, eh?

21:08.728 --> 21:10.495
Medical graduate.

21:10.528 --> 21:14.166
Placement with the UCI
for the Irish leg of the tour.

21:14.200 --> 21:15.701
Message from Viking.

21:20.039 --> 21:21.073
Good news?

21:22.141 --> 21:23.910
It's from my sister.

21:23.943 --> 21:25.778
Your sister?

21:25.811 --> 21:27.545
Yeah, yeah.
She wants me to call her.

21:27.579 --> 21:29.849
Don't talk to me about families.

23:27.967 --> 23:29.869
- Yeah?
- <i>Dom?</i>

23:29.902 --> 23:31.637
- Yeah?
- <i>Please come to my room. I cannot breathe.</i>

23:31.670 --> 23:34.006
No, just relax, relax.
Okay. Yeah, keep breathing, Tar.

23:34.040 --> 23:35.607
Okay, see you in a bit.

23:35.641 --> 23:37.143
The pressure's too much.

23:37.176 --> 23:39.278
I could not sleep.
I need to see the road, Dom.

23:39.311 --> 23:41.781
- Okay, I know but you gotta relax. Open up, open up.
- No.

23:41.814 --> 23:44.683
I was laying in that bed for two hours and
I couldn't sleep, Dom! I couldn't sleep.

23:44.717 --> 23:46.919
- You know as I said I need to see the finish line.
- You get this every time. Okay?

23:46.952 --> 23:49.587
It's always before a stage
you get this.

23:49.621 --> 23:51.123
No, Dom, I need... The finish
line, I cannot do anything, okay?

23:51.157 --> 23:52.858
Okay, can you breathe?
Can you breathe?

23:52.892 --> 23:54.960
Just breathe in.
You know the routine.

23:54.994 --> 23:57.063
The routine.
Put your hand on your nose.

23:57.096 --> 23:59.799
I was laying in my bed and I did not
see, I could not see the road.

24:00.966 --> 24:02.635
You focus, okay?
You listen to me.

24:02.668 --> 24:04.937
Close your eyes.
Put your hand on your nose.

24:04.970 --> 24:06.672
You see the road.
You see the road.

24:06.705 --> 24:09.809
You see the finish.
Okay, calm down. Relax.

24:09.842 --> 24:12.011
Calm, calm down.

24:13.846 --> 24:15.781
Hand on your nose.
Alright.

24:16.715 --> 24:19.819
Alright. Alright. And deep.

24:52.418 --> 24:53.919
Never stand up
when you can sit down.

24:53.953 --> 24:55.620
Never sit down
when you can lie down.

25:24.016 --> 25:25.851
I told you he has a big arm,
didn't I?

26:01.820 --> 26:04.190
Good work, son. Very good.

26:04.223 --> 26:06.325
I need this power
for the mountain.

26:06.358 --> 26:08.160
Have you tried sit up explodes?

26:09.895 --> 26:13.465
- What?
- They're the best exercise that maximize power.

26:13.499 --> 26:16.202
Lie back, stretch your arms out
like you're Christ on the cross.

26:16.235 --> 26:18.137
Dom, you grab hold
of his ankles.

26:18.170 --> 26:20.272
I'm gonna lay this towel across
your head and shoulders.

26:20.306 --> 26:23.108
When I pull it away you sit
up as fast as you can.

26:23.142 --> 26:24.243
- Okay.
- Ready? Here we go.

26:24.276 --> 26:25.878
And up.

26:26.946 --> 26:29.181
Can you feel the power it gives ya?
Come on, one more time.

26:29.215 --> 26:30.382
And up.

26:31.817 --> 26:34.286
One last time.
Really fast now and up.

26:42.528 --> 26:45.731
Team meeting. Let's go.

26:50.336 --> 26:51.971
I don't know.
He has no idea.

26:55.040 --> 26:56.275
Okay, ladies.

26:57.776 --> 27:01.347
I want to give you your race numbers
for tomorrow, but first some news.

27:01.380 --> 27:07.152
Last night I heard Team Settosa selected
a new young domestique, Jan Mertens.

27:07.186 --> 27:09.521
He's very fast and very strong.

27:09.555 --> 27:11.824
This has forced me
to rethink strategy.

27:12.825 --> 27:15.194
- Erik Schultz.
- Yeah?

27:15.227 --> 27:17.296
You will replace
Dom Chabol for the tour.

27:18.564 --> 27:21.267
Quiet! Quiet please.

27:21.300 --> 27:26.538
I want to take this opportunity to say, thank
you Dom for being there when we needed you.

27:26.572 --> 27:28.507
We couldn't have done it
without you.

27:28.540 --> 27:30.075
To Dom...

27:34.346 --> 27:35.981
For the rest of you...

27:56.168 --> 27:57.936
Dom, Dom, Dom.

27:59.204 --> 28:00.239
My friend.

28:02.642 --> 28:05.844
If this was my decision,
you're riding tomorrow.

28:05.878 --> 28:06.912
Believe me.

28:09.348 --> 28:10.382
Dom.

28:44.116 --> 28:45.551
Erik fucking Schultz!

28:45.584 --> 28:47.353
Erik is younger, lighter,
faster and stronger.

28:47.386 --> 28:49.656
He's not a lead out man!

28:49.689 --> 28:52.324
Does he know I have to put Tartare to
sleep like a little baby every night?

28:52.358 --> 28:54.360
Look at yourself, Dom.

28:54.393 --> 28:56.462
You're nearly 39 years old.

28:56.495 --> 28:59.064
- What do you want me to say?
- The team needs experience.

28:59.098 --> 29:02.167
- My experience!
- The wheels spin, spins again, then spins again.

29:02.201 --> 29:04.236
That's all the fucking
experience you need.

29:06.972 --> 29:08.675
The tour starts tomorrow, 10am.

29:08.708 --> 29:11.110
After the Grand Départ,
you're out of contract. Free to go.

29:12.244 --> 29:14.313
- That's it?
- That's it.

29:22.054 --> 29:23.088
Fuck!

29:30.730 --> 29:32.297
You alright, big man?

29:33.332 --> 29:36.636
I just heard the news.
What a cunt!

29:36.669 --> 29:39.571
Dom, open up.
We can get a bevy.

29:41.340 --> 29:42.508
Open up!

29:46.646 --> 29:48.213
I'll see ya later, okay?

29:56.088 --> 29:58.424
- What can I get ya?
- You have a wine list?

29:58.457 --> 29:59.491
Wine list?

30:03.228 --> 30:04.530
There you go, sir.

30:06.398 --> 30:07.734
That's it?

30:07.767 --> 30:09.067
That's it.

30:11.403 --> 30:12.571

Dom Chabol, the cyclist.

32:22.134 --> 32:26.538
Yeah, hi, uh, yeah, you told me to call
you in an emergency if things got worse.

32:27.774 --> 32:29.408
Yeah, things got worse.

32:31.510 --> 32:32.544
A lot worse.

32:36.348 --> 32:37.684
Are ya hurt?

32:39.451 --> 32:41.520
- What happened?
- Fell off my bike.

32:44.189 --> 32:45.357
Are you sure you're okay?

32:46.525 --> 32:48.560
Yeah.
I don't wanna talk about it.

32:51.263 --> 32:53.165
Well, where is it? Your bike?

32:53.198 --> 32:54.533
Threw it away.

32:54.566 --> 32:56.568
- You threw it away?
- Yeah. I threw it away.

32:57.502 --> 32:58.537
Yeah.

32:59.471 --> 33:00.572
Okay.

33:02.274 --> 33:03.643

- Hi.

33:25.665 --> 33:28.333
- And this is my uncle, John.
- Hiya.

33:28.367 --> 33:30.837
Dom is going to be riding in
the Tour de France on Saturday.

33:30.870 --> 33:34.841
Oh, he's in the Tour de France.
Fair play to ya.

33:34.874 --> 33:38.510
Carmel. Carmel!
Here a sec.

33:40.512 --> 33:42.514
Dom here is in
the Tour de France.

33:42.547 --> 33:44.349
How are you, Dom?

33:44.383 --> 33:46.518
Is it true you fellas
shave your legs?

33:46.551 --> 33:48.553
- Yeah.
- And arms?

33:48.587 --> 33:51.189
- Yeah. Some do.
- Anywhere else?

33:53.726 --> 33:55.527
- Here Dom...
- Hmm?

33:55.560 --> 33:58.230
The race, are you gonna win?

33:58.263 --> 34:00.298
- No. I'm a domestique.
- A what?

34:00.332 --> 34:03.602
I'm a domestique. I'm a support rider.
I'm not supposed to win.

34:03.636 --> 34:06.405
- You're not supposed to win?
- No. It's not my job.

34:06.438 --> 34:08.675
The lead rider wins.

34:08.708 --> 34:12.476
So I set the pace. He's close behind
me in the wheel and I push the air.

34:12.511 --> 34:14.413
Push the air?
What, like a slipstream?

34:14.446 --> 34:16.916
Yeah, I block the wind.

34:16.949 --> 34:19.686
When the sprint comes, I move over so he flies
out of my wheel towards the finish line.

34:19.719 --> 34:23.455
So I use my energy for him
to use it at that moment.

34:26.257 --> 34:27.927
You're not supposed to win?

34:29.293 --> 34:30.630
No.

34:30.663 --> 34:32.496
But don't you ever
wanna win yourself?

34:32.531 --> 34:34.399
Yeah, of course every rider
wants to win a stage but...

34:36.969 --> 34:38.570
it's a dream.

35:22.380 --> 35:23.482
You need to go.

35:24.817 --> 35:27.019
- What?
- You need to go to your own room.

35:27.053 --> 35:29.689
- Why?
- I've got work in a few hours and so do you.

35:30.757 --> 35:32.759
Come on, let's go!

35:32.792 --> 35:34.627
Yeah.

35:34.660 --> 35:37.830
Just... it wouldn't be good
for either of us if anyone saw.

35:37.864 --> 35:39.799
You know what I mean?
It's kind of unprofessional.

35:45.905 --> 35:47.640
Don't take it personally.

35:47.673 --> 35:49.474
- And we can meet later on.
- Yeah.

35:49.508 --> 35:50.710
After the race will you be free?

35:52.745 --> 35:54.981
Okay, um...

35:55.014 --> 35:57.917
- Well, see you at the bar downstairs at eight, okay?
- Yeah.

35:57.950 --> 35:59.819
Okay. Okay, go go. Bye.

36:22.574 --> 36:23.943
Dom, open up.

36:26.913 --> 36:28.080
Dom!

36:29.481 --> 36:30.582
What?

36:31.651 --> 36:35.353
You're back on. Enzo is sick.
He's in hospital.

36:35.387 --> 36:36.689
We registered you.

36:41.060 --> 36:42.094
Look, Dom...

36:43.029 --> 36:45.665
I know I said a lot of shit
in the gym.

36:47.432 --> 36:49.035
But now I need you.

36:49.068 --> 36:51.403
The team needs you.

36:51.436 --> 36:52.672
And what about next year?

36:52.705 --> 36:54.841
I haven't got time for this,
Dom.

36:54.874 --> 36:56.642
The fact is, you're still under contract.
So get your shit together.

37:13.525 --> 37:14.559
Yes!

37:24.036 --> 37:26.471
Lazarus is raised.

37:59.571 --> 38:03.009
Yes, and here we are on an
unusually sunny day in Dublin,

38:03.042 --> 38:04.877
the capital city
of the Emerald Isle

38:04.911 --> 38:07.146
where the Grand Départ
is not far off.

38:07.179 --> 38:12.484
Today there's a carnival atmosphere.
And Irish eyes are smiling.

38:16.122 --> 38:20.726
<i>Welcome to the official
start of the Tour de France 1998.</i>

<i>Interesting to see
how they'll get along this year.</i>

38:55.027 --> 38:56.796

<i>He's passing, he's passing.</i>

41:21.907 --> 41:23.709
<i>Surely. Yes, he has it!</i>

41:23.742 --> 41:25.644
<i>The Italian takes
the yellow jersey. Narrow...</i>

41:25.678 --> 41:27.746
<i>And Tartare wins!</i>

41:27.780 --> 41:29.081
<i>Tartare!</i>

41:29.115 --> 41:31.684

<i>Winners of the first stage

41:42.962 --> 41:45.898
That was pure fucking poetry!

41:45.931 --> 41:48.300
Hey, Dardonne,
you won the Maillot Blanc.

41:48.334 --> 41:49.935
The white jersey. You won it!

41:51.637 --> 41:54.773

Where's Settosa?

42:16.162 --> 42:18.297
Big congratulations to Tartare!

42:21.967 --> 42:25.704
Bravo! Bravo, Dardonne
for the white jersey.

42:25.738 --> 42:27.273
Good on ya, mate!

42:30.276 --> 42:32.778
I want to say something
straight from my heart.

42:32.811 --> 42:35.281
Great teams work like...
like machines.

42:35.314 --> 42:38.150
You know, you've got all different
parts and they work alone.

42:38.184 --> 42:40.386
But it's better
all together as one.

42:40.419 --> 42:43.055
And today we showed that
we're a great team!

42:48.494 --> 42:49.995
And you are my family.

42:55.801 --> 42:57.169
And to win, I need you.

42:58.404 --> 42:59.338
But, Dom...

43:03.442 --> 43:07.346
You're the great domestique, the best
lead out man on the road. So to Dom.

43:07.379 --> 43:08.914
Back where he belongs!

43:08.948 --> 43:10.983
- Good on you, mate!
- To Dom, yeah.

43:11.016 --> 43:12.284
Dom, cheers.

43:28.434 --> 43:30.936
Sonny, the guys you rode
with back in the '70s.

43:32.238 --> 43:33.472
What do they do now?

43:35.074 --> 43:37.042
Well, lemme see.

43:37.076 --> 43:38.444
You know what happened
to Jacamo?

43:38.477 --> 43:41.113
He landed on his feet,
the jammy bastard.

43:42.014 --> 43:46.185
Marco B, he became a sports
coach in his hometown.

43:46.218 --> 43:48.087
Who else was there?

43:48.120 --> 43:50.256
Jannis.

43:50.289 --> 43:54.360
- Ah, no, Eddie, What's his name? No, no, Jeff or some...
- Eddie de Cavort.

43:54.393 --> 43:58.197
Aye. De Cavort.
He became a taxi driver man.

43:58.230 --> 43:59.932
Owns his own business now
by the way.

44:01.066 --> 44:02.368
Yeah, some didn't make it.

44:04.069 --> 44:07.172
Johannes, Drier, Bert,
Uster, Bosh.

44:08.274 --> 44:10.976
Went to bed and never woke up.

44:11.010 --> 44:13.312
Right. Over you go.

44:13.345 --> 44:16.081
I'll finish you off so to speak.

44:21.020 --> 44:23.155
What about you, Sonny?
You still happy here at Austrange?

44:23.188 --> 44:27.293
Well, I don't know about
Austrange, but I love this circus.

44:27.326 --> 44:29.261
I fucking love it.

44:29.295 --> 44:32.531
I couldn't do anything else anyway.
My heart was fucked.

44:32.564 --> 44:34.967
Doctors advised me
to pack it in.

44:35.000 --> 44:38.404
I didn't mind. I'd had enough.
Enough of the bike that is.

44:38.437 --> 44:40.306
- And then?
- Well, you know Bonheur?

44:40.339 --> 44:42.574
- The Director of Sportif of Settosa?
- Aye.

44:42.608 --> 44:46.378
One day he gave me a box of oil and
tells me to rub down one of the guys.

44:46.412 --> 44:47.913
And I've been doing
that ever since.

44:48.881 --> 44:51.216
Happy as a pig in shite.

45:00.359 --> 45:01.393
Dom?

48:01.206 --> 48:03.175
Two minutes in, two minutes out.

48:05.544 --> 48:09.515
- Do you want me to get that?
- No, it's probably Tar or my sister. Leave it.

48:10.717 --> 48:13.118
What is this, Glasgow Central?

48:18.390 --> 48:20.158
- Oh, hello.
- Is Dom there?

48:20.192 --> 48:23.228
We had an arrangement to meet
in the bar at 8.

48:23.262 --> 48:26.298
Just gimme a wee second there.

48:26.331 --> 48:28.567
That young doctor.
Did you arrange to meet her?

48:28.600 --> 48:30.335
Yeah, I forgot.

48:30.369 --> 48:31.638
No bother.

48:33.405 --> 48:36.308
Aye, he's, uh...
he's coming now.

48:37.342 --> 48:39.444
Sorry.

48:39.478 --> 48:41.380
I told Sonny to come down and
tell you that I was gonna be late.

48:41.413 --> 48:43.215
- 'Cause of the race and...
- Slipped my mind.

48:43.248 --> 48:46.485
The madness of the first day
and everything. I'm sorry.

48:46.518 --> 48:47.553
You wanna come in?

48:53.693 --> 48:55.561
Isn't this lovely?

48:55.594 --> 48:56.796
I'll see you later, okay?

49:01.500 --> 49:04.570
- Yeah, I'm really sorry. Um...
- Okay.

49:04.603 --> 49:06.405
How was your first
day on the Tour?

49:06.438 --> 49:09.207
Well, my medical training
wasn't exactly put to the test.

49:09.241 --> 49:10.777
Zero action.

49:10.810 --> 49:12.845
Praying for a big pile up
tomorrow.

49:12.879 --> 49:16.315
Lots of nasty gashes and concussions
so I can get my hands dirty.

49:17.884 --> 49:20.152
I'll see what
I can do to help.

49:20.185 --> 49:21.788
What's with all the ice?

49:21.821 --> 49:24.356
I mean,
I can't believe it.

49:24.389 --> 49:27.593
Here I am on work placement with the Tour
de France and I get to stay in a hotel.

49:27.627 --> 49:30.128
What a buzz.
And I tell you what.

49:30.162 --> 49:35.434
I am fucking lucky to be doing that rather
than interning at some shitty hospital.

49:36.401 --> 49:39.739
I mean, to my mind,
to do anything well,

49:39.772 --> 49:43.408
I mean, to be really fucking
good at it you've got to feel it.

49:43.442 --> 49:46.311
Especially, when you're dealing
with people's lives.

49:46.345 --> 49:48.513
Yeah.

49:48.547 --> 49:50.248
I mean, it must be the
same with you guys, all or nothing.

49:50.282 --> 49:52.517
- How long have you been cycling?
- Since I could walk.

49:52.551 --> 49:55.922
Been competing for, um...
for 25 years.

49:55.955 --> 49:58.725
Yeah. That's probably longer
than you've been alive.

50:00.459 --> 50:02.662
Well, I wasn't gonna say that
but, um, but yeah.

50:04.429 --> 50:06.733
Well, I mean, you must have been
to some amazing places.

50:06.766 --> 50:08.635
Seen some incredible sights.

50:08.668 --> 50:11.169
Seen a lot of bad hotels
and a lot of macadam.

50:12.437 --> 50:15.407
Do you mean tarmacadam?

50:15.440 --> 50:17.576
Yeah, macadam..

50:17.609 --> 50:21.948
. Uh, you know, I've probably
raced on every continent in the world.

50:21.981 --> 50:26.485
Like, I go to Rome for a race and
then, you know, we're in the city

50:26.518 --> 50:29.656
and I'm there with 150 other guys on
a bike. And all I see is men's asses.

50:31.456 --> 50:33.525
Well, I can think of
worse things to be looking at.

50:39.364 --> 50:40.800
- Hello?
- <i>Dom.</i>

50:40.833 --> 50:43.736
Tartare.
Yeah, no, no, relax. Relax.

50:43.770 --> 50:45.470
- Yeah. Breathe.
- <i>No, man. I cannot breathe.</i>

50:45.504 --> 50:47.807
Breathe, Tar.
I'll be there in five minutes.

50:47.840 --> 50:50.777
Okay, yeah, bye..

50:50.810 --> 50:52.679
He does not sound very happy.

50:52.712 --> 50:56.615
No, he's, um... That's my lead
rider and he's a bit, um...

50:56.649 --> 50:58.383
Look, do you wanna stay here?

50:58.417 --> 50:59.852
- I'll be back in five minutes.
- Mm-hmm.

50:59.886 --> 51:02.421
Okay, so...

51:02.454 --> 51:04.691
Not the second time. No, I promise
you, I cannot. I stop. I fucking stop.

51:04.724 --> 51:05.758
- Tar.
- I fucking stop riding the bike.

51:05.792 --> 51:07.660
Every single night you get this.

51:07.694 --> 51:09.528
You know the routine, can you
just please think about it.

51:09.561 --> 51:10.897
- Just put your...
- Yeah, but why? Why?

51:10.930 --> 51:12.531
Why am I doing this?
Why? He asked me?

51:28.480 --> 51:31.851
Jesus Christ.

51:31.884 --> 51:34.619
Okay.

51:34.654 --> 51:35.955
It's good, that's good,
that's good.

53:07.546 --> 53:09.649
Dom? Dom!

53:10.883 --> 53:12.517
Dom.

53:12.551 --> 53:16.889
Dom! Wake up.

53:29.434 --> 53:31.037
I don't know.
He can't catch his breath.

53:31.070 --> 53:33.572
Jesus!
We need to get him moving.

53:33.605 --> 53:35.808
- I'll call an ambulance.
- Come on, up you come.

53:35.842 --> 53:37.643
- Okay.
- Come here! Come here!

53:38.778 --> 53:41.714
Keep walking him up and down.

53:41.747 --> 53:43.783
I'll be back in a sec.
Keep walking him!

53:43.816 --> 53:48.654
Hey, hey. Dom, Dom. It's okay.
It's okay, just walk. Walk.

53:48.688 --> 53:51.489
Just keep walking. Here we go..

53:53.960 --> 53:56.729
Just keep walking.
Just keep walking.

53:56.762 --> 53:59.932
- Dom! Dom! Come on. Come on.
- Right, here we go.

53:59.966 --> 54:01.901
What are you doing? Fuck.

54:01.934 --> 54:05.437
Dom, Dom. What are you doing with
that, Sonny? What's going on?

54:05.470 --> 54:06.806
Okay. Dom?

54:06.839 --> 54:09.608
- Dom? Hey, Dom?
- Alright, big man.

54:09.642 --> 54:11.978
You know the drill.
Come on, up ya come.

54:12.011 --> 54:14.046
Unless you wanna die in some
grubby hotel on the arse end of...

54:14.080 --> 54:15.648
What are you trying to do
with him?

54:15.681 --> 54:17.750
- Just get him on the bike.
- No, no.

54:17.783 --> 54:19.018
- He's got to go to the fucking hospital!
- Do as I ask!

54:19.051 --> 54:20.418
- God!
- After three.

54:20.452 --> 54:22.554
- What?
- Help me with his leg.

54:22.587 --> 54:24.891
- No, no, no. He needs to go to fucking hospital.
- One, two, three.

54:24.924 --> 54:26.626
- Okay.
- That's it.

54:26.659 --> 54:28.460
Come on, Dom.

54:28.493 --> 54:31.063
Now push down.
That's it.

54:31.097 --> 54:32.732
Push down.

54:32.765 --> 54:33.966
- Come on now.
- Are you okay, Dom?

54:34.000 --> 54:35.735
Push down, that's it, son.

54:35.768 --> 54:37.069
- Where's his monitor?
- Huh?

54:37.103 --> 54:38.570
His heart monitor!
Where is it?

54:38.603 --> 54:39.839
- It's in the bathroom.
- Get it!

54:39.872 --> 54:42.141
Okay.

54:42.174 --> 54:45.978
That's it, Dom. That's it. You're doing
good. You're doing great. Come on, son.

54:46.012 --> 54:47.780
Help me put it on him, eh?

54:47.813 --> 54:49.949
Give it to me.

54:49.982 --> 54:52.450
Come on, Dom. Keep going.
Keep going.

54:52.484 --> 54:54.452
- This is insane.
- That's it, keep going.

54:54.486 --> 54:56.222
- He's on something, isn't he?
- You're coming up, Dom!

54:56.255 --> 54:58.925
You're coming up.

54:58.958 --> 55:02.028
I can't watch this.
I'm calling an ambulance.

55:06.165 --> 55:09.035
I've got this from here,
darling.

55:11.003 --> 55:14.907
That's it Dom.
Come on now. You keep going.

55:14.941 --> 55:17.509
37..

55:17.542 --> 55:20.246
38.

55:20.279 --> 55:22.514
39.

55:22.547 --> 55:25.517
Come on now, you push down.

55:28.688 --> 55:32.959
That's it, Dom, you're, you're doing great.
Come on, son. Come on.

55:54.747 --> 55:56.248
Alright, big man?

56:07.193 --> 56:10.730
Lynn. Listen, about last night, I'm
just, please, I'll try and explain.

56:10.763 --> 56:12.965
You don't need to explain
anything to me.

56:12.999 --> 56:15.668
I've actually learned quite
a lot in the last few hours

56:15.701 --> 56:18.904
and realized you guys are all
off your heads on EPO.

56:18.938 --> 56:22.041
EPO. You... you might as well be
putting fucking glue in your veins.

56:22.074 --> 56:24.010
It's amazing you ever wake up.

56:24.043 --> 56:26.544
How do you think that
made me feel? As a doctor?

56:26.578 --> 56:29.782
Do you know what I cannot wrap my head
around is why risk your life like that?

56:29.815 --> 56:31.851
Everybody does it.

56:31.884 --> 56:35.221
You're not even allowed to win, Dom.
You're a professional loser.

56:35.254 --> 56:37.622
Professional fucking loser.

56:54.707 --> 56:56.675
I didn't shit myself, did I?

56:56.709 --> 56:58.911
No.
No, you didn't shit yourself.

56:58.944 --> 57:01.847
Dom, that was a close
fucking call.

57:01.881 --> 57:04.950
If it wasn't for her, you wouldn't
have forgotten to wear your monitor.

57:04.984 --> 57:08.721
The team needs your focus now.
Nothing to distract you.

57:08.754 --> 57:10.656
Dom! Sonny!

57:30.042 --> 57:31.811
We need to get you
watered down.

57:33.679 --> 57:35.714
<i>The Settosa team car was
stopped and searched by French police</i>

57:35.748 --> 57:37.883
<i>at a border crossing in
the early hours of this morning.</i>

57:37.917 --> 57:42.054
<i>Authorities say the haul of
160 capsules of testosterone,</i>

57:42.088 --> 57:47.393
<i>82 vials of human growth hormone
and 234 doses of EPO</i>

57:47.426 --> 57:50.262
<i>was unlikely
for personal consumption.</i>

57:50.296 --> 57:55.968
<i>As a result, the UCI will now carry out random
mandatory drug testing before every stage.</i>

57:56.001 --> 57:59.271
Keep munching those pills
and drinking that water.

58:09.682 --> 58:12.318
- What the...
- Who's this?

58:15.688 --> 58:18.290
Alright, alright.
I'm coming.

58:18.324 --> 58:21.393
There's a doctor from the UCI downstairs.
He wants to test some of the team.

58:21.427 --> 58:25.197
- Okay, stall him as long as you can.
- Sonny, we'd better be okay.

58:26.765 --> 58:30.069
- What is it, mate?
- UCI are downstairs.

58:30.102 --> 58:32.905
- They're here now?
- Fuck!

58:32.938 --> 58:35.007
Come on, get that stuff into ya.

58:39.411 --> 58:42.414
I'm good.

58:42.448 --> 58:44.984
<i>Meanwhile,
the team soigneur and doctor</i>

58:45.017 --> 58:47.386
<i>have been suspended and charged
with drug offences.</i>

58:47.419 --> 58:50.756
<i>Their solicitor has admitted that
drugs were supplied to cyclists.</i>

58:50.789 --> 58:52.324
How does it look?

58:54.226 --> 58:57.329
Still over 50%.

58:57.363 --> 59:00.299
Kiwi, you're fine.
You two won't pass.

59:11.277 --> 59:12.778
Come in please.

59:20.119 --> 59:21.987
Do you see who I see?

59:23.088 --> 59:27.126
Hello, gentlemen.
My name is Dr. Dirk Foegol.

59:27.159 --> 59:31.297
I'm here officially
on the 12th of July 1998

59:31.330 --> 59:36.068
at the behest of the Union of Cyclists
International Blood Screening Programme.

59:36.101 --> 59:40.005
We are here to perform mandatory
random testing for banned substances.

59:40.039 --> 59:44.777
This will entail extracting blood samples
from three members of team Austrange.

59:44.810 --> 59:46.946
Fucking vampires!

59:50.416 --> 59:55.754
The competitors who have been randomly
selected for testing here today are...

59:56.455 --> 59:58.390
Mr. Lionel Dardonne.

01:00:00.893 --> 01:00:02.728
Make your way
to the testing table.

01:00:04.496 --> 01:00:06.398
Mr. Erik Schultz.

01:00:09.134 --> 01:00:12.004
And finally,
Mr. Dominique Chabol.

01:00:12.037 --> 01:00:12.771
Fuck.

01:00:16.375 --> 01:00:18.744
- Mr. Chabol, are you here?
- Yes.

01:00:20.279 --> 01:00:22.248
Thank you, Mr. Chabol.

01:00:22.281 --> 01:00:25.150
If you could please approach
the testing table.

01:00:33.926 --> 01:00:35.361
Thank you, Mr. Dardonne.

01:00:49.541 --> 01:00:50.509
Thank you.

01:00:51.243 --> 01:00:53.879
Thank you, Mr. Schultz.

01:01:07.192 --> 01:01:09.028
Arm please.

01:01:09.061 --> 01:01:12.031
You said you'd be helping us
if we'd fall off our bikes.

01:01:12.064 --> 01:01:15.134
He's the boss.
I do what he asks.

01:01:15.167 --> 01:01:16.969
Hold out your arm please.

01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:42.394
Okay.

01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:50.903
- .
- Shit! Oh, my God!

01:01:50.936 --> 01:01:53.238
I'm so sorry. Should I...?

01:01:53.272 --> 01:01:55.908
Just leave it.
Prepare another sample.

01:01:55.941 --> 01:01:57.644
- Okay.
- Mr. Chabol.

01:01:57.677 --> 01:01:59.211
Foegol.

01:02:00.346 --> 01:02:02.548
One rider, one sample.

01:02:03.549 --> 01:02:05.050
Your rules.

01:02:09.221 --> 01:02:11.056
He's correct.

01:02:11.090 --> 01:02:13.959
Each rider is obliged
to provide only one sample.

01:02:13.992 --> 01:02:15.394
Let's go, Dom.

01:02:34.546 --> 01:02:37.449
<i>This is the steepest
climb of the Irish leg of the tour,</i>

01:02:37.483 --> 01:02:41.253
<i>with only 50 kilometers to go,
the gradient has split the peloton.</i>

01:02:41.286 --> 01:02:44.691
<i>Team Austrange at its head, protecting
yellow jersey winner Tartare Marino</i>

01:02:44.724 --> 01:02:46.626
<i>as they make the
climb up the Wicklow gap.</i>

01:02:50.396 --> 01:02:52.531
Tar, you okay?

01:03:05.645 --> 01:03:08.313
You need to help me.
I need to make pee pee.

01:03:08.347 --> 01:03:09.982
- Now?
- Yeah, now.

01:03:11.718 --> 01:03:15.154
- Kiwi.
- Yeah, coming.

01:03:15.187 --> 01:03:16.422
On the way.

01:03:19.692 --> 01:03:21.694
- Help me, okay?
- Yeah, we got you.

01:03:21.728 --> 01:03:23.529
- Yeah.
- Ah!

01:03:23.562 --> 01:03:26.165
He's pissing like
a bloody racehorse.

01:03:39.511 --> 01:03:43.382
<i>Great to see the fans out
here today. Some of them in fancy dress.</i>

01:03:43.415 --> 01:03:49.121
<i>And keenly watching and waiting to see who
will break away and take this second stage.</i>

01:03:56.562 --> 01:04:00.098
What the fuck?
Sonny, Sonny, catch up with Dom!

01:04:00.132 --> 01:04:01.600
Alright, will do.

01:04:04.737 --> 01:04:06.505
Dom!

01:04:06.538 --> 01:04:08.440
What's with Dardonne?

01:04:08.474 --> 01:04:10.142
- What?
- He's bonking back there!

01:04:10.175 --> 01:04:11.510
- Who?
- Dardonne!

01:04:11.543 --> 01:04:14.112
He's... he's like
a fucking donkey!

01:04:14.146 --> 01:04:16.081
I'll go check.

01:04:30.395 --> 01:04:32.765
<i>It's an attack
from Stefano Drago of Settosa.</i>

01:04:32.799 --> 01:04:36.134
<i>He's determined to redeem himself
after last year's disqualification.</i>

01:04:37.436 --> 01:04:40.105
Dom, it's an attack! Dom!

01:04:44.409 --> 01:04:47.613
<i>Austrange have got some work
to do to catch him on the downhill slope.</i>

01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:58.457
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
from Luxembourg, Stefano Drago!</i>

01:05:02.461 --> 01:05:04.429
You shit, you think
about yourself!

01:05:09.869 --> 01:05:14.439
I lost because of you. And it's about the
victory of the team. About my victory.

01:05:14.473 --> 01:05:16.542
Calm the fuck down,
okay, he had a bad day.

01:05:16.575 --> 01:05:19.545
And where were you? I didn't see you.
I lost 50 seconds because of you.

01:05:19.578 --> 01:05:21.748
You left me with the.

01:05:21.781 --> 01:05:23.650
- . I didn't see you okay? That's all...
- You didn't see me?

01:05:23.683 --> 01:05:25.417
- No.
- Then you go to the doctor and get eyes tested.

01:05:26.552 --> 01:05:28.855
- Okay, let's, let's go.
- No, we need to resolve this.

01:05:28.888 --> 01:05:32.124
- And because of Stevie Wonder here, I lost 50 seconds!
- Get in the fucking bus!

01:05:32.157 --> 01:05:34.393
- Fucking Stevie Wonder!
- It's okay. It's okay.

01:06:33.552 --> 01:06:36.188
Go. Go and talk to him.

01:06:57.542 --> 01:06:59.311
-What?

01:07:06.418 --> 01:07:08.186
What?

01:08:24.029 --> 01:08:25.898
Sonny?

01:08:36.908 --> 01:08:40.680
Sonny! Sonny! Hey!
Hey, Sonny!

01:08:45.718 --> 01:08:47.352
Sonny, hey!

01:08:51.823 --> 01:08:55.627
Okay, breathing.
Okay, okay, okay. You're okay.

01:08:55.661 --> 01:08:57.295
Shit!

01:09:04.036 --> 01:09:05.904
Yes, emergency.
There's a man on the floor.

01:09:05.938 --> 01:09:07.404
- <i>Is he breathing?</i>
- Um, yes, he's breathing.

01:09:07.439 --> 01:09:08.808
I'm calling
from the Slaney Hotel.

01:09:19.919 --> 01:09:23.790
Lynn!
Lynn, it's Dom. Please open up.

01:09:23.823 --> 01:09:27.059
Lynn. Er, it's Sonny.
Sorry to bother you. He's on the floor.

01:09:27.093 --> 01:09:29.828
He's sick. I don't know why.
I think it's his heart.

01:09:31.930 --> 01:09:34.599
- Did you call an ambulance?
- Yeah, yeah, they're on their way.

01:09:39.037 --> 01:09:40.872
Sonny? Hey?

01:09:42.742 --> 01:09:44.911
- Get some aspirin.
- What?

01:09:44.944 --> 01:09:48.380
Aspirin! Surely you have aspirin?
You have every other fucking drug.

01:10:05.698 --> 01:10:08.567
- I've just known him for such a long time.
- How long?

01:10:10.569 --> 01:10:11.804
Thirteen, fourteen years.

01:10:13.239 --> 01:10:15.975
You know he's given up everything
for cycling. His family, his friends.

01:10:16.008 --> 01:10:18.644
He's... he's so passionate
about it.

01:10:18.678 --> 01:10:24.050
Like, um, I was riding up L'Alpe
d'Huez this one time in the tour and...

01:10:25.417 --> 01:10:27.419
I'm in so much pain.

01:10:27.452 --> 01:10:28.955
Like...

01:10:30.823 --> 01:10:34.026
and team car pulls up to me.

01:10:34.060 --> 01:10:37.562
And Sonny pops out his head
and he gives me a sandwich

01:10:37.596 --> 01:10:43.102
and... and I take out the sandwich
and it's, it's wrapped in a porno mag.

01:10:45.503 --> 01:10:49.008
And... and just for this one
second I forget about the pain.

01:10:50.843 --> 01:10:52.510
And he knows me so well,
you know?

01:11:00.585 --> 01:11:03.990
- How is he? Can I go in?
- There's not much more we can do.

01:11:04.023 --> 01:11:07.960
I'm sorry. You should spend
some time with him.

01:11:09.594 --> 01:11:10.997
Thank you, Doctor.

01:11:15.134 --> 01:11:18.603
Uh, he's... Yeah.

01:11:18.638 --> 01:11:21.406
You go.
I'll see you back at the hotel.

01:11:35.154 --> 01:11:36.689
Alright, big man.

01:12:55.634 --> 01:12:57.069
Thank you.

01:13:24.030 --> 01:13:25.965
I'm so sorry, Dom.

01:13:25.998 --> 01:13:27.767
I know you guys were close.

01:13:30.936 --> 01:13:33.039
He always said you'd
do something special.

01:13:33.072 --> 01:13:36.742
You remember that time
in Grenoble, years ago?

01:13:36.776 --> 01:13:38.978
That time you came close
to winning the stage?

01:13:40.112 --> 01:13:45.217
He was hanging out the team car window, screaming
and banging on the door during the race.

01:13:45.251 --> 01:13:47.319
He was heartbroken
when you lost.

01:13:48.354 --> 01:13:51.290
I had to get the car doors
fixed after that race.

01:13:52.324 --> 01:13:57.163
Cost me a fucking fortune.

01:14:40.973 --> 01:14:42.842
Is that for Sonny?

01:14:42.875 --> 01:14:44.176
Yeah.

01:14:51.217 --> 01:14:53.152
Hey.

01:14:53.185 --> 01:14:54.787
Got you something.

01:14:59.158 --> 01:15:00.826
- What's that?
- Open it.

01:15:10.169 --> 01:15:11.937
It's a little mini you.

01:15:19.478 --> 01:15:23.816
No, no, no, he's like James Dean.
You know James Dean? That's you.

01:15:23.849 --> 01:15:26.685
- From me, that's you.
- You know James Dean.

01:15:26.719 --> 01:15:29.255
The batteries
are in the saddle bags.

01:15:29.288 --> 01:15:32.358
It's his, uh...
it's his EPO stash.

01:15:32.391 --> 01:15:34.193
- What would you like to drink?
- Coffee.

01:15:34.226 --> 01:15:36.428
- Coffee.
- Three coffee, one water.

01:15:36.462 --> 01:15:38.831
Hey, Dom. Sorry to break up
your little party.

01:15:38.864 --> 01:15:41.934
I need to talk to you.
It's important, it's about today.

01:15:41.967 --> 01:15:44.970
- Actually, we're in the middle of something.
- I'm sorry, who are you?

01:15:45.004 --> 01:15:48.107
Oh, wait, the spatter.
Yes, I know you.

01:15:48.140 --> 01:15:52.111
You're the doctor. No, the vampire lady.
Ooh, what's going on?

01:15:52.144 --> 01:15:54.146
- Dom, are you with the enemy now, hmm?
- The enemy?

01:15:54.180 --> 01:15:55.948
Excuse me.
Do you love him?

01:15:55.981 --> 01:15:59.051
I mean, do you love this guy?

01:15:59.084 --> 01:16:03.889
'Cause I'm gonna tell you this. A lot of women,
they love riders. We got women everywhere.

01:16:03.923 --> 01:16:06.325
So don't let this
Casanova break your balls.

01:16:08.060 --> 01:16:10.763
You remember the time that
we fucked that same lady, Dom?

01:16:11.897 --> 01:16:13.966
Hmm? I mean, not together.

01:16:13.999 --> 01:16:16.068
- I was first but we did.
- That's enough, Tar.

01:16:16.101 --> 01:16:19.171
It was a small race in
a small town. It was a nice lady.

01:16:19.205 --> 01:16:21.006
Like a big nice lady, you know.

01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:23.475
I wink. She smiles.

01:16:23.509 --> 01:16:26.845
- We make like eye contact and it keeps on going, lap after lap.
- Tar.

01:16:26.879 --> 01:16:30.516
Lap 50, I thought there was
one button open here.

01:16:30.549 --> 01:16:34.286
At 51 there was another button open.
I saw like a small titty coming out.

01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:39.758
I was going crazy, you know? Lap 60, I was way
out in front. So think, oh, let's do something.

01:16:39.792 --> 01:16:45.164
I was alone. So I will stop beside her.
We went behind some bush and I fucked her.

01:16:45.197 --> 01:16:46.265
And guess what?

01:16:48.133 --> 01:16:50.803
I still managed to win the race.

01:16:51.937 --> 01:16:56.875
You mustn't last very long.
Now why don't you just fuck off!

01:17:08.587 --> 01:17:10.489
Stop! What are you doing?

01:17:15.027 --> 01:17:17.162
Is your hand okay?

01:17:17.196 --> 01:17:19.765
Such a prick. I don't know
how you put up with him.

01:17:24.436 --> 01:17:25.771
What's that one from?

01:17:27.273 --> 01:17:32.077
Um, that was in the La Vuelta 1994.
I smashed my shoulder.

01:17:32.111 --> 01:17:34.246
And this one?
What's that from?

01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:37.483
Uh, reconstructed my shoulder blade
after, um, a fall in the descent...

01:17:37.516 --> 01:17:38.784
And that?

01:17:40.619 --> 01:17:44.556
Uh, bunch sprint in the Giro.
I have another scar here.

01:17:44.590 --> 01:17:47.526
It's from '78 at Antwerp.
It's, um...

01:17:47.559 --> 01:17:51.397
That's your appendix. I did study medicine.

01:17:51.430 --> 01:17:54.166
You really need to start
looking after yourself, Dom.

01:17:54.199 --> 01:17:57.503
Get out of this fucking circus!

01:17:57.536 --> 01:18:00.906
Lynn, I'm a domestique, okay? That's
what I do. Without a bike, I'm nobody.

01:18:02.941 --> 01:18:05.444
And I'm fucking nobody.

01:18:15.054 --> 01:18:16.288
Do you want me to get that?

01:18:16.322 --> 01:18:21.026
No, it's, uh...
probably my sister.

01:18:23.128 --> 01:18:26.865
- My father died four days ago and she was calling me.
- Oh, my God! Dom...

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:29.034
why didn't you say?

01:18:31.303 --> 01:18:32.438
'Cause...

01:18:33.972 --> 01:18:38.010
I haven't spoken to my father in many
years and not to my mother either.

01:18:38.043 --> 01:18:41.380
And it's not like we had a bad
relationship or anything. It's just that...

01:18:44.416 --> 01:18:46.452
It's not like your family,
you know?

01:18:46.485 --> 01:18:48.954
Like everybody goes to the pub
together and tells their stories.

01:18:48.987 --> 01:18:50.989
And they're all together and
you're all having fun. It's...

01:18:51.990 --> 01:18:54.526
it's not like that with us.

01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:57.363
So... so my sister, she calls me
when we land here in Ireland.

01:18:57.396 --> 01:18:59.031
And she says,

01:18:59.064 --> 01:19:00.999
you gotta come to the funeral.
I'm like, but...

01:19:01.033 --> 01:19:02.534
Aren't you going?

01:19:05.705 --> 01:19:07.239
He's your father, Dom.

01:19:11.043 --> 01:19:12.478
You need to go home.

01:19:22.588 --> 01:19:24.556
- Are you going?
- Yep.

01:19:48.280 --> 01:19:50.015
I... I need to go.

01:19:58.223 --> 01:19:59.626
Lynn.

01:20:02.227 --> 01:20:03.630
That blood sample.

01:20:06.198 --> 01:20:07.466
Did you drop it on purpose?

01:22:36.214 --> 01:22:37.516
I'm sorry.

01:22:38.718 --> 01:22:41.353
It was wrong what I did,
what I say, I...

01:22:42.421 --> 01:22:45.490
you know,
how I am under pressure, no?

01:22:45.524 --> 01:22:47.292
Are you okay?

01:22:48.861 --> 01:22:50.730
Yeah. um...

01:22:50.763 --> 01:22:53.365
Made these armbands, you know,
as a memory to Sonny.

01:22:53.398 --> 01:22:56.703
Maybe we can wear them
during the race like this?

01:22:59.171 --> 01:23:00.572
Give it to me.

01:23:00.606 --> 01:23:03.475
Excuse me. Sorry, Sir!

01:23:03.508 --> 01:23:07.847
Sir. You can't wear that without prior permission
of the Tour de France Executive Committee.

01:23:07.880 --> 01:23:10.850
Yeah, our soigneur died yesterday so I'd
like to wear it as a tribute. Is that okay?

01:23:10.883 --> 01:23:13.720
I am sorry about your soigneur but we can't
allow teams to change their uniforms without...

01:23:13.753 --> 01:23:16.254
- Viking! Viking!
- What is it, Dom?

01:23:16.288 --> 01:23:18.758
Listen, there's a problem with the armband.
It's just an armband. Come on.

01:23:18.791 --> 01:23:21.894
- What's the problem?
- He's making a problem of the armband.

01:23:21.928 --> 01:23:23.428
Well, what happened?

01:23:23.462 --> 01:23:25.297
Unless I receive
official clearance,

01:23:25.330 --> 01:23:27.432
there is no way anyone can
wear armbands in any capacity.

01:23:27.466 --> 01:23:29.769
- Your team could face disqualification.
- It's just a fucking armband!

01:23:30.937 --> 01:23:33.773
What if he wears it underneath
his jersey as a compromise?

01:23:34.741 --> 01:23:36.208
That could work.

01:23:37.542 --> 01:23:39.611
What? Under?

01:23:39.646 --> 01:23:41.681
It's the fucking Tour
de France, Dom!

01:23:41.714 --> 01:23:44.216
Our riders are ready.
Let's start the countdown.

01:23:44.249 --> 01:23:50.222
5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Go!

01:23:58.397 --> 01:24:03.670
<i>The peloton departs Enniscorthy on the
200th anniversary of the 1798 rebellion</i>

01:24:03.703 --> 01:24:06.773
<i>in the final Irish stage
of this year's Tour de France.</i>

01:24:29.862 --> 01:24:31.496
Just turn around.

01:24:51.550 --> 01:24:53.786
Hey, guys, stay with Tar, okay?

01:24:53.820 --> 01:24:56.989
Come on, come on, come on.

01:24:59.792 --> 01:25:02.795
<i>And Settosa have
attacked, making a break from the peloton.</i>

01:25:02.829 --> 01:25:06.833
<i>And, oh, my goodness,
Stefano Drago has just crashed.</i>

01:25:06.866 --> 01:25:11.570
<i>What a disaster for the current
yellow jersey holder, Stefano Drago.</i>

01:25:41.768 --> 01:25:43.870
Come on, Drago.

01:25:52.812 --> 01:25:57.415
<i>Oh, a spectator has
run onto the road, causing utter chaos.</i>

01:26:13.065 --> 01:26:16.669
<i>Four riders left in this incredible stage.
Headed up by Dom Chabol.</i>

01:26:16.702 --> 01:26:18.638
<i>Tartare pulling up at the rear.</i>

01:26:20.405 --> 01:26:23.876
<i>Chabol glances around to make way
for Tartare to sprint over the line.</i>

01:26:30.950 --> 01:26:33.585
Don't fuck with me, Dom!

01:26:33.618 --> 01:26:35.554
<i>But what's happening?
I've never seen anything like this.</i>

01:26:35.587 --> 01:26:37.957
<i>Chabol is actually racing
against his own team leader.</i>

01:26:49.467 --> 01:26:53.773
<i>Oh, and Chabol wins the stage
for the first time.</i>

01:26:53.806 --> 01:26:59.477
<i>Dominique Chabol wins.
He wins the yellow jersey!</i>

01:27:12.024 --> 01:27:16.494
<i>And after an amazing stage win, donning
the Maillot Jaune, the yellow jersey</i>

01:27:16.528 --> 01:27:19.899
<i>for the first time in his long and
illustrious career as a domestique,</i>

01:27:19.932 --> 01:27:23.135
<i>Dom Chabol revels in the
glory of the winner's podium.</i>

01:27:23.169 --> 01:27:26.939
<i>Sporting a black armband in memory
of his soigneur, Sonny McElhone,</i>

01:27:26.973 --> 01:27:29.541
<i>who unfortunately died
of a heart attack yesterday.</i>

01:27:29.574 --> 01:27:32.845
<i>Sonny, an ex-rider himself,
will be sorely missed by team Austrange.</i>

01:27:32.879 --> 01:27:37.817
<i>But today it's all about Chabol and his
extraordinary victory over his own team leader.</i>

01:28:20.059 --> 01:28:21.493
<i>Hello?</i>

01:28:21.526 --> 01:28:22.594
<i>Dom?</i>

01:28:34.073 --> 01:28:36.709
- I'm going home.
- What?

01:28:36.742 --> 01:28:38.811
- I'm out.
- Why?

01:28:40.012 --> 01:28:41.981
This is about you and Tartare?

01:28:43.548 --> 01:28:45.751
All families have their
ups and downs.

01:28:46.886 --> 01:28:50.189
Don't quit on me now.
You won a fucking stage.

01:28:52.825 --> 01:28:55.795
- I have a taxi waiting.
- Dom, Dom, Dom, talk to me.

01:28:57.196 --> 01:29:00.900
I was gonna renew your contract.
Take you past your 40th birthday.

01:29:00.933 --> 01:29:04.804
Not many riders get that kind of
security, my friend. Not at your age.

01:29:05.871 --> 01:29:06.906
Have a think about it.

01:29:12.078 --> 01:29:14.647
What are you saying?
What's the difference?

01:29:14.680 --> 01:29:16.082
Dom Chabol
This is something else.

01:29:16.115 --> 01:29:18.250
Viking, what did he say?

01:29:40.039 --> 01:29:42.108
You won.

01:29:42.141 --> 01:29:43.709
You won the yellow jersey, no?

01:29:47.213 --> 01:29:49.882
We are a great team
you and me, no?

01:29:51.616 --> 01:29:54.086
We're the best, simply the best.
Like the song.

01:29:59.225 --> 01:30:01.260
I can't go on the bus
without you.

01:30:01.293 --> 01:30:03.863
- I gotta go home.
- What do you mean, go home?

01:30:04.830 --> 01:30:08.234
To do what? Like are you gonna work
in a bar? Drive a taxi like that guy?

01:30:10.236 --> 01:30:12.271
Let's go to France.

01:30:12.304 --> 01:30:15.808
I'm fucking sick of this
Irish place and the shit coffee.

01:30:16.809 --> 01:30:18.711
Let's go to France and win.
