WEBVTT

00:54.125 --> 00:57.500
[Bragg] The Empire thanks you
for your years of service

00:57.500 --> 01:00.125
and wishes you well on your retirement.

01:00.125 --> 01:02.208
[clone] Huh. Forced retirement.

01:02.208 --> 01:05.333
We're soldiers.
What are we supposed to do now?

01:05.333 --> 01:08.500
Please direct all your questions
and concerns

01:08.500 --> 01:11.125
to the Imperial Information Bureau.

01:12.416 --> 01:15.041
[lieutenant] CT-9904?

01:16.750 --> 01:18.333
You're out of uniform.

01:24.166 --> 01:27.583
I'm Lieutenant Nolan,
your commanding officer for this mission.

01:27.583 --> 01:30.916
We're heading to the Imperial Depot
on Barton-4.

01:30.916 --> 01:35.041
High-value cargo stored there
has been targeted by local insurgents.

01:35.041 --> 01:38.125
We're to secure it
until it's transferred at week's end.

01:38.125 --> 01:40.916
- [clone 1] At least it's a field mission.
- [clone 2] No kidding.

01:40.916 --> 01:42.333
[sighs]

01:42.333 --> 01:45.333
Fantastic. More clones.

01:45.333 --> 01:47.833
Problem, sir?

01:47.833 --> 01:51.041
Yes. I don't like used equipment.

01:54.125 --> 01:55.208
Let's go.

02:22.166 --> 02:25.708
[wind howling]

02:50.583 --> 02:52.666
[grunts, gasps]

02:53.166 --> 02:55.208
You! Guard the ship.

03:02.750 --> 03:05.041
[wind howling]

03:10.625 --> 03:12.416
[ice vulture screeches]

03:33.791 --> 03:34.791
[clears throat]

03:35.583 --> 03:37.291
Where is your supervisor?

03:37.791 --> 03:38.791
[droid chatters]

03:38.791 --> 03:41.250
You must be our reinforcements.

03:42.500 --> 03:45.791
We expected you 36 rotations ago.

03:47.125 --> 03:48.583
Did you get lost?

03:48.583 --> 03:52.875
We work on the Empire's schedule,
trooper, not yours.

03:52.875 --> 03:55.916
It's Commander, Lieutenant.

03:56.625 --> 03:58.583
Well, Commander,

03:58.583 --> 04:02.750
your orders were to guard and protect
this facility and its cargo,

04:02.750 --> 04:05.375
yet this outpost is grossly unguarded.

04:05.958 --> 04:07.625
Where are the rest of your men?

04:09.291 --> 04:10.291
Dead.

04:12.416 --> 04:16.000
Hexx, Veetch, and I,
we're all that's left.

04:17.333 --> 04:20.208
Your failings will be dealt with later.

04:20.208 --> 04:24.375
For now, I am in charge here
until the cargo is transported.

04:25.208 --> 04:27.666
I feel safer already.

04:27.666 --> 04:32.541
Look here, clone,
you speak to me with respect.

04:34.250 --> 04:38.875
In my experience,
respect is something to be earned.

04:40.458 --> 04:44.583
Yet the Empire assigned you
to this desolate rock,

04:44.583 --> 04:48.333
where you let the majority
of your squad get killed.

04:49.333 --> 04:50.583
Tell me, Lieutenant...

04:52.166 --> 04:54.250
how many missions have you commanded?

04:58.666 --> 05:00.583
That's what I thought.

05:01.583 --> 05:05.750
Boys, why don't you help
the new boss get situated?

05:13.083 --> 05:16.375
You, uh, know the lieutenant well?

05:17.083 --> 05:19.041
For about two hours.

05:19.041 --> 05:22.208
[scoffs] Two hours too long, I bet.

05:23.041 --> 05:24.041
[Crosshair] Hmm.

05:28.541 --> 05:32.541
So, what'd you do
to get stuck with this mission?

05:33.791 --> 05:36.583
Just lucky, I guess.

05:37.250 --> 05:39.583
[laughs, sighs]

05:40.500 --> 05:41.875
The name's Mayday.

05:47.250 --> 05:48.333
Crosshair.

05:49.208 --> 05:51.416
Welcome to The Outpost.

05:55.041 --> 05:56.791
I'll give you a lay of the land.

06:03.833 --> 06:05.083
[door opens]

06:05.875 --> 06:07.333
[wind howling]

06:09.208 --> 06:10.208
[sensor post whirring]

06:10.208 --> 06:14.333
[Mayday] I've been stationed on this rock
for over a year watching that cargo.

06:14.916 --> 06:17.500
Now that it's finally getting transported,

06:17.500 --> 06:20.708
me and my squad
can hopefully get out of here.

06:22.625 --> 06:24.791
[Crosshair]
Who's been attacking the depot?

06:25.291 --> 06:28.333
Uh, locals. Raiders.

06:28.333 --> 06:31.291
Last few attacks caught us off guard.

06:32.208 --> 06:34.625
How did they bypass the sensors?

06:34.625 --> 06:36.208
[whirring continues]

06:37.875 --> 06:39.333
- [beeps]
- [whirring accelerates]

06:39.333 --> 06:41.583
Conditions have degraded our equipment.

06:42.458 --> 06:46.125
I requested replacements but got none.

06:46.125 --> 06:49.333
Yet we're told
to protect the cargo at all costs.

06:49.916 --> 06:53.166
Why? What's inside those crates?

06:53.166 --> 06:54.250
[Mayday] Hmm.

06:54.250 --> 06:57.541
Yeah, I've wondered that myself every day.

06:58.625 --> 06:59.875
You don't know?

06:59.875 --> 07:03.625
Apparently,
it's above a clone trooper's pay grade.

07:09.083 --> 07:13.500
If you're gonna scout,
don't go alone, and don't go far.

07:14.375 --> 07:21.250
You'll freeze to death in that armor,
unless what's in the ice kills you first.

07:21.250 --> 07:23.291
[ice vulture screeches]

07:23.291 --> 07:26.041
Either way, it will make them happy.

07:27.625 --> 07:29.208
[screeches]

07:31.166 --> 07:34.750
[Mayday] Vicious creatures,
but you have to admire 'em.

07:35.666 --> 07:37.833
- They find a way to survive.
- [blaster fire over comlink]

07:37.833 --> 07:40.458
[Veetch, on comm] <i>Commander,
raiders spotted inside the perimeter.</i>

07:41.625 --> 07:44.166
- [alarm blaring]
- I'll cover the west. You take the east.

07:44.166 --> 07:45.416
We'll cut 'em off.

07:47.958 --> 07:49.458
[blaster fire in distance]

07:49.958 --> 07:51.708
[alarm continues]

08:00.250 --> 08:01.583
[Veetch, on comm] <i>Hexx is down.</i>

08:01.583 --> 08:04.625
<i>Three raiders are heading
towards the shuttle at zero-one-five.</i>

08:11.333 --> 08:13.541
[groaning]

08:13.541 --> 08:15.375
[high-pitched tone]

08:16.125 --> 08:18.541
- [groaning continues]
- [tone stops]

08:20.708 --> 08:22.166
[grunting]

08:33.916 --> 08:35.208
[grunting]

08:37.500 --> 08:39.083
[alarm continues]

09:29.250 --> 09:30.833
[footsteps approaching]

09:31.375 --> 09:34.125
[Mayday] A snow skiff took off
down the western ridge.

09:34.125 --> 09:37.000
The rest must've fled on foot
into the mountain pass.

09:37.500 --> 09:38.583
[Crosshair] Wrong.

09:43.583 --> 09:46.666
So that's how they snuck past
our defenses.

09:48.791 --> 09:51.125
[wind howling]

10:02.916 --> 10:05.958
What are you doing just standing around?

10:05.958 --> 10:09.291
Those raiders stole two crates of cargo
during that attack.

10:09.291 --> 10:11.041
Send your troops to retrieve it.

10:11.833 --> 10:15.791
Hexx and Veetch were killed in the ambush.

10:16.708 --> 10:20.333
We don't have the manpower or gear
for a mission beyond the perimeter.

10:20.833 --> 10:22.750
Especially just to recover a few crates.

10:22.750 --> 10:26.291
It's not up to you to determine
what is of value to the Empire.

10:27.041 --> 10:29.958
Then I need all your men for this mission.

10:30.458 --> 10:33.333
And leave this outpost vulnerable
to another attack?

10:33.333 --> 10:35.000
I think not.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.291
This task falls to you two,
and you two alone.

10:38.791 --> 10:40.875
Recover the cargo.

10:40.875 --> 10:43.541
Is that clear?

10:44.625 --> 10:47.208
Yes, Lieutenant.

11:29.041 --> 11:31.000
[Crosshair] He didn't get far.

11:31.666 --> 11:33.875
[Mayday] Not sure what bothers me more.

11:33.875 --> 11:40.375
That he's wearing armor stolen off my men,
or that his cohorts just left him here.

11:40.375 --> 11:42.833
[Crosshair]
No point in carrying deadweight.

11:44.583 --> 11:47.833
Remind me not to die on your watch.

12:01.500 --> 12:03.291
[rumbling]

12:07.583 --> 12:10.958
[Mayday] Maybe it's just the ice.

12:16.458 --> 12:17.541
[metal clicks]

12:20.250 --> 12:21.250
[Mayday] Pressure mine.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.125
[Crosshair] Mm-hmm.

12:28.666 --> 12:31.375
[Mayday] What were you saying
about deadweight?

12:32.000 --> 12:34.208
[Crosshair] Do you know how to disarm it?

12:34.791 --> 12:36.833
I'm not an explosives expert,

12:36.833 --> 12:42.166
but since I don't feel like carrying
your body back to the outpost,

12:42.875 --> 12:44.708
I guess I'll give it a shot.

12:47.750 --> 12:48.750
Hmm.

12:48.750 --> 12:52.041
This mine's a little different
than ones I've seen before,

12:52.750 --> 12:54.583
but I'm pretty sure they're all the same.

12:55.916 --> 12:58.333
Guess we'll find out soon enough, huh?

13:03.125 --> 13:06.125
I wish I had
the proper equipment for this,

13:06.125 --> 13:09.000
but the Empire's ignored all my requests.

13:10.125 --> 13:11.958
I've learned to improvise though.

13:13.625 --> 13:16.208
I guess all clones have had to
since the war.

13:19.041 --> 13:24.541
Can't say I ever thought much about
the war ending... [sighs] ...until it did.

13:27.083 --> 13:28.500
What unit were you with?

13:29.791 --> 13:31.416
It doesn't matter.

13:31.416 --> 13:32.708
Humor me.

13:33.791 --> 13:35.375
I could use the distraction.

13:37.458 --> 13:39.500
[Crosshair] Clone Force 99.

13:40.333 --> 13:41.708
What happened to them?

13:42.708 --> 13:44.500
They're gone.

13:45.625 --> 13:49.416
And here we are, the survivors.

13:49.416 --> 13:54.125
Hmm. Combat troopers stuck
babysitting cargo shipments.

13:54.833 --> 13:56.208
Mission's a mission.

13:56.750 --> 14:00.041
[chuckles] Yeah,
I used to say the same thing.

14:01.750 --> 14:02.750
There.

14:05.125 --> 14:06.416
That should do it.

14:11.458 --> 14:13.625
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Don't pick up your foot yet.

14:13.625 --> 14:18.583
Wait until I tell you,
then lift it, but real slow like.

14:19.583 --> 14:21.125
I'll wait around the bend.

14:21.125 --> 14:25.041
If I don't hear a boom,
then I'll know it worked.

14:25.041 --> 14:27.750
[Crosshair]
Glad you're confident in your work.

14:27.750 --> 14:31.541
Oh, I'm confident. I'm just not stupid.

14:32.750 --> 14:35.583
Remember, nice and slow.

14:36.083 --> 14:37.250
On the count of three.

14:38.083 --> 14:39.083
One.

14:40.375 --> 14:41.375
Two.

14:42.375 --> 14:43.625
Three.

14:49.166 --> 14:50.333
[Crosshair sighs]

14:57.708 --> 14:59.708
[wind howling]

15:16.666 --> 15:18.541
[Crosshair] Multiple contacts inside.

15:19.541 --> 15:21.291
Two guards at the entrance.

15:22.916 --> 15:25.208
[Mayday] Eh,
shouldn't be a problem for us.

15:25.208 --> 15:26.458
[Crosshair] Mm-hmm.

15:32.583 --> 15:34.041
[raider 1 trills]

15:37.041 --> 15:38.041
[raider 2 grunts]

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
[grunts]

15:41.208 --> 15:42.583
- [Mayday grunts]
- [raider 1 groans]

15:55.166 --> 15:59.666
[raiders grunting, muttering]

16:01.833 --> 16:03.333
[raiders trilling]

16:07.958 --> 16:09.500
[stun grenade beeps]

16:12.125 --> 16:14.416
[all gasp, groan]

16:23.666 --> 16:24.708
[raider grunts]

16:31.041 --> 16:33.875
[Mayday grunts, groans]

16:34.541 --> 16:36.541
[raiders grunting]

16:43.375 --> 16:45.041
[raiders grunting]

16:55.375 --> 16:56.458
[raiders groaning]

16:57.541 --> 16:58.833
[rumbling]

17:08.791 --> 17:10.041
[Mayday coughs]

17:16.208 --> 17:18.541
[Mayday] Let's load the cargo
and get out of here.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.166
Gear?

17:38.166 --> 17:40.750
We've been risking our lives
to recover equipment

17:40.750 --> 17:42.875
we could have been wearing
this whole time?

17:44.750 --> 17:47.250
It's not clone trooper gear.

17:53.375 --> 17:54.916
Right.

17:55.583 --> 18:01.458
New toys for their shiny new military,
and we get the scraps.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.041
After all the clones have done,

18:06.375 --> 18:07.916
all we've sacrificed...

18:09.000 --> 18:12.541
We're good soldiers. We followed orders.

18:13.416 --> 18:14.750
And for what?

18:17.541 --> 18:22.041
[rumbling]

18:30.333 --> 18:31.708
Go!

18:46.583 --> 18:47.916
[Mayday] Look out!

18:51.458 --> 18:52.458
[gasps]

19:02.500 --> 19:04.500
[wind howling]

19:09.958 --> 19:12.291
[gasps, panting]

19:13.333 --> 19:15.833
[straining]

19:21.750 --> 19:22.750
[sighs]

19:22.750 --> 19:25.541
[shivering]

19:33.375 --> 19:36.041
[panting]

19:47.750 --> 19:50.583
[panting]

20:05.291 --> 20:06.333
Mayday?

20:11.750 --> 20:14.375
- Mayday, wake up!
- [groaning]

20:14.375 --> 20:17.500
- Come on. We have to move.
- [groans]

20:18.291 --> 20:20.666
[grunts] Go.

20:21.416 --> 20:23.666
[sighs] I won't make it.

20:23.666 --> 20:26.041
[panting]

20:39.625 --> 20:41.291
[Crosshair pants]

20:50.625 --> 20:52.541
[Mayday grunts, coughs]

21:56.625 --> 21:59.958
[shivering]

22:13.041 --> 22:14.875
[ice vulture screeching]

22:28.958 --> 22:30.833
[Imperial cargo ships flying over]

22:37.833 --> 22:41.416
[pants, groans]

23:03.958 --> 23:05.791
- [datapad beeping]
- [stormtrooper 1] Over there.

23:05.791 --> 23:06.875
[stormtrooper 2] Look!

23:06.875 --> 23:09.125
- [stormtrooper 3] It's them.
- [stormtrooper 4] Follow me!

23:18.666 --> 23:20.541
[Nolan] Step aside. Step aside!

23:27.875 --> 23:30.458
[Mayday grunts, groans]

23:31.375 --> 23:32.375
[sighs]

23:35.416 --> 23:38.000
Get back to work and load those crates.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.208
All of you!

23:49.875 --> 23:51.958
[Mayday groaning]

23:51.958 --> 23:53.750
About time you two returned.

23:53.750 --> 23:55.125
[Mayday groans]

23:55.125 --> 23:57.625
He-- [pants]

23:57.625 --> 23:59.916
- He needs a medic.
- [coughing]

24:00.833 --> 24:05.250
I see you didn't retrieve the crates,
which means you've failed your mission.

24:05.250 --> 24:08.708
Did you hear what I said? Help him!

24:08.708 --> 24:10.750
Certainly not.

24:10.750 --> 24:13.750
That would be a waste
of the Empire's resources.

24:13.750 --> 24:16.500
He'll-- He'll die.

24:16.500 --> 24:18.291
[Mayday coughs]

24:18.291 --> 24:23.541
[groaning]

24:28.125 --> 24:30.250
[pants, grunts]

24:32.041 --> 24:37.500
He served his purpose
as a soldier of the Empire.

24:40.250 --> 24:44.500
You-- You could have saved him!

24:45.000 --> 24:47.541
[Nolan] Perhaps you didn't hear me.

24:48.375 --> 24:53.583
He is expendable, as are you.

24:54.583 --> 24:59.250
And if you speak to me again
with such disrespect,

24:59.250 --> 25:03.541
I'll see to it you meet
a similar fate, clone.

25:15.208 --> 25:19.041
Now, leave him and get back to work...

25:20.541 --> 25:22.500
while you're still useful.

25:27.083 --> 25:28.708
[ice vulture screeches]

25:35.375 --> 25:37.166
[screeches]

25:50.500 --> 25:51.833
Lieutenant.

25:58.166 --> 26:00.416
[Nolan groans, coughs]

26:07.833 --> 26:08.916

26:14.125 --> 26:16.500

27:01.208 --> 27:06.583
[groaning]

27:06.583 --> 27:07.958
[sighs]

27:07.958 --> 27:10.791
[Emerie] Hello, CT-9904.

27:15.250 --> 27:17.791
Or do you prefer Crosshair?

27:22.291 --> 27:24.041
[datapad beeps]

27:25.666 --> 27:26.875
[control panel beeping]

27:26.875 --> 27:29.958
[pants] Where am I?

27:30.541 --> 27:32.750
I'm holding you for observation.

27:32.750 --> 27:35.500
Once you've healed,
the doctor will come for you.

27:36.375 --> 27:37.375
Who--

27:38.875 --> 27:40.416
Who are you?

27:42.708 --> 27:43.791
[Emerie] Remain calm.

27:43.791 --> 27:45.041
[grunts]

27:45.041 --> 27:47.541
Cooperate and you might survive.

27:55.041 --> 27:56.375
[panting]

28:01.541 --> 28:03.041
[panting continues]
