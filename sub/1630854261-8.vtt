Yo, is it me, or did
everybody on campus
come out to celebrate?

00:32.240 --> 00:33.825
As they should, man.

00:33.867 --> 00:35.827
We just beat
the best D-1 school
in the country, man.

00:35.869 --> 00:38.079
Between J.R.'s catch
to clinch the win...

00:38.121 --> 00:41.666
Oh, man. And that tag-team
no-hitter, which is
you and Damon, pssh,

00:41.708 --> 00:43.585
folks are gonna be talking
about this game for a minute.

00:43.626 --> 00:45.879
And where is Damon? Ain't
the spotlight his thing?

00:45.920 --> 00:48.506
Mm-mm. The only attention
he'd want is from Thea
on Blue Ridge Mountain.

00:48.548 --> 00:50.258
You know what I'm
talking about?

00:50.300 --> 00:52.093
Emcee: Everybody
make some noise.

00:52.135 --> 00:53.803
We got Damon Sims
in the building, y'all.

00:53.845 --> 00:55.096
I guess you spoke
too soon, boys.

00:55.138 --> 00:56.264
[Cheering and applause]

00:56.306 --> 00:57.265
What's up, B.U.?

00:57.307 --> 00:59.392
[Louder cheers]

00:59.434 --> 01:01.936
Hey, look, I appreciate
y'all coming out

01:01.978 --> 01:03.521
and supporting the team.

01:03.563 --> 01:06.483
Matter of fact, shout out
to my boys for the dub.

01:06.524 --> 01:09.194
Damon and students: Yeah!

01:09.235 --> 01:11.738
We gettin' lit tonight. Ha ha!

01:11.780 --> 01:14.240
And we not
leaving until they kick us out.

01:14.282 --> 01:17.535
Yeah!
[New song starts]

01:22.582 --> 01:24.459
Ain't you supposed to be on
a weekend getaway with Thea?

01:24.501 --> 01:26.419
Not anymore.

01:26.461 --> 01:28.004
What happened?

01:28.046 --> 01:30.173
[Knock on door]

01:30.215 --> 01:31.716
Look, Thea,
I love you.

01:31.758 --> 01:33.384
Can't we just
work this out?

01:33.426 --> 01:36.137
I love you, too. But I
can't lose myself in you.

01:36.179 --> 01:38.056
I have to take
a break from us.

01:38.098 --> 01:39.474
You know, nothing that's

01:39.516 --> 01:41.810
gonna stop me from
having a good time.

01:47.690 --> 01:49.943
Look who finally made it.

01:49.984 --> 01:51.736
I was wondering if you
was gonna roll through.

01:51.778 --> 01:54.239
Oh, yeah. Apparently,
this is the place to be,

01:54.280 --> 01:56.032
and the dorms
are empty, so...

01:56.074 --> 01:57.992
Is everything all right?

01:58.034 --> 02:00.245
Did anything crazy
happen to you yesterday

02:00.286 --> 02:01.621
when you took
your drug test?

02:01.663 --> 02:03.331
Uh, no. Why do you ask?

02:03.373 --> 02:05.792
No reason.

02:05.834 --> 02:07.752
Simone, what's up?

02:07.794 --> 02:09.712
We're friends now, right?
Talk to me.

02:09.754 --> 02:12.549
I shouldn't have come.
This is stupid.

02:12.590 --> 02:14.634
Simone, wait. What...?

02:26.146 --> 02:27.772
Damon: Yo. Ha ha!

02:27.814 --> 02:29.274
Damon, what?

02:29.315 --> 02:32.735
OK. Your time is up.
You might want to go
somewhere else.

02:32.777 --> 02:34.112
Hold up. Wait.

02:34.154 --> 02:36.698
Damon, come here.

02:36.739 --> 02:38.032
Yo. What?

02:38.074 --> 02:39.117
What the hell is
going on?

02:39.159 --> 02:40.827
I'm just having a good time.

02:40.869 --> 02:42.620
Yeah. With someone
who's not your girl?

02:42.662 --> 02:44.455
Damon, what's gotten
into you?

02:44.497 --> 02:46.249
Look, I don't have a girl.

02:46.291 --> 02:48.793
Me and Thea, we're done
or on a break.

02:48.835 --> 02:51.296
Look, I--I don't even know.
[Chuckles]

02:51.337 --> 02:53.131
Well, I'm sorry.
But what happened?

02:53.173 --> 02:55.842
Thea said that I was
the cause of her
losing focus on tennis

02:55.884 --> 02:56.885
or whatever.

02:56.926 --> 02:58.428
Look, I don't even care,
all right?

02:58.469 --> 03:00.305
Boy, that is a lie.

03:00.346 --> 03:03.349
Don't let pain
and alcohol
make you stupid.

03:03.391 --> 03:05.810
And you know Thea
is new to this
relationship stuff.

03:05.852 --> 03:07.687
Maybe she's
just overwhelmed

03:07.729 --> 03:10.773
with her recovery
and everything else.

03:10.815 --> 03:12.483
Think so?

03:12.525 --> 03:14.569
You won't know until
you talk to her again.

03:14.611 --> 03:17.155
Trust me, things will be
clearer in the morning

03:17.197 --> 03:18.656
for the both of you.

03:18.698 --> 03:22.577
All right.
Well, now your turn.
What's going on?

03:26.206 --> 03:28.208
I failed my drug test.

03:28.249 --> 03:29.667
I tested positive
for THC.

03:29.709 --> 03:31.169
-Wait. You?
-Yeah.

03:31.211 --> 03:33.171
Simone, ain't no way.
That test got to be faulty.

03:33.213 --> 03:35.006
That's what I said.

03:35.048 --> 03:37.008
So the athletic director
is letting me
take another test,

03:37.050 --> 03:39.052
and he said he'll
give me the results
in the morning.

03:39.093 --> 03:40.511
I mean, that's foul.

03:40.553 --> 03:42.347
I'm surprised that
you even here right now.

03:42.388 --> 03:44.182
Trust me,
I don't want to be,

03:44.224 --> 03:45.516
but everybody is here,

03:45.558 --> 03:46.893
and I wanted to ask
some of the athletes

03:46.935 --> 03:49.646
if they tested
positive, too.

03:49.687 --> 03:53.483
But, Simone, a garage party
with everybody getting lit

03:53.524 --> 03:55.401
ain't necessarily
the place for all that.

03:55.443 --> 03:58.363
So what am I supposed
to do, stay in my room
and do nothing?

03:58.404 --> 04:00.990
Damon, my future is
on the line.

04:01.032 --> 04:03.868
Not really. The test is
gonna come back negative,

04:03.910 --> 04:06.204
and then you'll be good.

04:06.246 --> 04:10.041
You're gonna be OK,
Simone, all right?

04:10.083 --> 04:11.459
Come here. Heh!

04:13.878 --> 04:15.797
You'll be good. Ha ha.

Hey, beautiful,
you sleep good?

04:36.651 --> 04:38.820
What's with
the furniture?

04:38.861 --> 04:40.071
[Groans]

04:40.113 --> 04:41.406
I was just redecorating.

04:41.447 --> 04:42.824
Or you lied about
sleeping in

04:42.865 --> 04:44.409
and spent last night
rehearsing.

04:44.450 --> 04:46.411
Cam, I--

04:46.452 --> 04:47.537
And then you lie to
cover up the lie?

04:47.578 --> 04:48.746
Is that what we do?

04:48.788 --> 04:50.206
I need to nail this routine.

04:50.248 --> 04:51.833
No, you need
to rest, bae.

04:51.874 --> 04:53.293
If I want to be
the best, Cam,

04:53.334 --> 04:54.669
I have to push myself
to the limit.

04:54.711 --> 04:56.087
That's Dr. Pace talking.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.505
And what is so bad
about that?

04:57.547 --> 04:59.299
Look, I know you want
to dance,

04:59.340 --> 05:00.967
but this whole burning
the candle on
both ends thing

05:01.009 --> 05:02.302
ain't where it's at.

05:02.343 --> 05:04.012
See? I knew you
wouldn't understand.

05:04.053 --> 05:06.389
You know what? I don't.

05:06.431 --> 05:09.600
But do you, Keish.
I'll catch you later.

05:17.108 --> 05:18.609

05:18.651 --> 05:20.111
Hey.

05:20.153 --> 05:21.362
Hey.

Look, I...

05:23.323 --> 05:25.616
um...

05:25.658 --> 05:27.160
I--I don't
want to break it.

05:27.201 --> 05:30.455
Can't we just, like,
go to dinner or something

05:30.496 --> 05:32.290
and figure this out?

05:32.332 --> 05:33.958
Damon, I meant what I said.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.086
I can't lose myself in you,

05:37.128 --> 05:39.464
and if we
stay together, I will.

05:39.505 --> 05:42.133
I will never let
that happen.

05:42.175 --> 05:44.302
That's the thing.

05:44.344 --> 05:46.262
Damon, you're like a sun.

05:46.304 --> 05:51.768
Everything and everyone
in your orbit
revolves around you.

05:51.809 --> 05:54.020
Couldn't stop it
if you tried.

Whoa. Hey.

[Chuckles softly]

05:59.650 --> 06:02.153
That's it?

06:02.195 --> 06:05.073

just done?

06:05.114 --> 06:08.451

06:27.887 --> 06:30.556
Loni: Simone, I was really
hoping this was a mistake,

06:30.598 --> 06:33.851
but your retest came back
positive for THC.

06:33.893 --> 06:36.270
What? Coach,
that's not possible.

06:36.312 --> 06:38.189
I--I didn't ingest THC.

06:38.231 --> 06:40.483
Two drug tests say otherwise.

06:40.525 --> 06:43.778
I have to say, I expected
better from you.

06:43.820 --> 06:45.571
[Sighs]

06:45.613 --> 06:48.658
Normally, since THC isn't
a performance-enhancing drug,

06:48.699 --> 06:53.746
I'll be more lenient, but I'm
following NCAA guidelines.

06:53.788 --> 06:57.583
All eyes have been on
B.U. sports because of
the new baseball scandal.

06:57.625 --> 07:00.420
Wait. What baseball scandal?

07:00.461 --> 07:03.089
Reporter: Everyone is wondering
how an HBCU upset

07:03.131 --> 07:05.091
one of the biggest D-1 schools
in the country.

07:05.133 --> 07:07.969
But the biggest question
swirling around the NCAA is,

07:08.010 --> 07:12.473
How did a small HBCU recruit an
MLB prospect like Damon Sims...

07:12.515 --> 07:15.309
Bringston didn't
do anything. You came
back on your own.

07:15.351 --> 07:17.103
Yeah. And we
all know that, too.

07:17.145 --> 07:19.147
But the story that they're
trying to spin--

07:19.188 --> 07:21.441
Is that Bringston
did something foul
to get Damon here.

07:21.482 --> 07:23.609
Which implies
that I'm dirty, too.

07:23.651 --> 07:25.903
Santiago: I can't believe
the baseball team is
involved in another scandal.

07:25.945 --> 07:27.447
Not just
the baseball team.

07:27.488 --> 07:29.282
All of Bringston
sports is on blast.

07:29.323 --> 07:30.783
Simone: Which is
why the athletic director

07:30.825 --> 07:32.910
is throwing the book at me.

07:32.952 --> 07:35.705
I've been suspended from
tennis for half the season,

07:35.746 --> 07:39.625
which means I lost my spot
on the top 6.

07:46.924 --> 07:49.177
If the tests are right,

07:49.218 --> 07:52.180
then the THC got
in my system somehow.

07:52.221 --> 07:54.640
Could you have eaten
something that had THC in it

07:54.682 --> 07:56.058
without realizing it?

07:56.100 --> 07:58.644
No. Auntie, I am
super careful.

07:58.686 --> 08:02.106
The only logical
explanation is that
someone dosed me.

08:02.148 --> 08:03.691
Who would want to do that?

08:03.733 --> 08:05.109
Tootie springs to mind

08:05.151 --> 08:07.862
or a PKZ interest
who's super competitive.

I'm gonna have a little
chat with the A.D.

the unsubstantiated rumors

about the baseball team.

08:13.534 --> 08:15.495
Auntie, if you do that,
it'll look like

I'm getting
preferential treatment
from the president.

Baby girl,
I am still your aunt.

go through this alone.

And I won't let you
jeopardize your position.

08:24.712 --> 08:28.299
We stopped family dinners
to avoid this appearance
that you have favoritism,

08:28.341 --> 08:30.718
and the last thing
you need right now is

to finish up, Mr. Logan.

for Cam.

It's nice to see
the rules finally
applying to everyone.

09:02.250 --> 09:03.834
Either he heard
the entire conversation

09:03.876 --> 09:05.211
or the word
is getting out.

Don't worry about that.

got in your system.

09:09.465 --> 09:10.800

stay Switzerland,

09:14.178 --> 09:15.721
OK?

Damon: Coach, they're saying
that Bringston cheated
in getting me here,

09:19.767 --> 09:21.102
bribed me with an NIL deal.

09:21.143 --> 09:23.104
That's the PG-13
theory.

at the ready.

for us to do is ignore this.

they come for you.

like this.

What do you suggest we do?

09:38.911 --> 09:39.579
A press conference.

09:39.620 --> 09:41.956
That will keep
the story alive,
and we don't want that.

09:41.998 --> 09:45.543
Trust me, the media
will get bored

09:45.585 --> 09:47.086
and will move on
in a few days.

pay for school.

19:23.162 --> 19:25.080
Do you
finally get it now?

19:25.122 --> 19:27.040
Your skills on
the field

19:27.082 --> 19:28.792
and your decisions
off the field

19:28.834 --> 19:32.087
have the power
to blow up
people's lives,

19:32.129 --> 19:33.839
and those are the facts.

19:38.468 --> 19:40.137
Y'all give us a minute.

19:40.179 --> 19:41.680
J.R.: Yes, sir.
Santiago: Yup.

19:41.722 --> 19:43.891
What the hell were
you thinking?

19:43.932 --> 19:45.809
Look, Coach, I was
just defending the team.

19:45.851 --> 19:47.936
No. You just gave
those reporters something
new to run with.

19:47.978 --> 19:51.815
It made us look like
we have something to hide
even when we don't.

19:51.857 --> 19:53.233
Look.

20:02.159 --> 20:03.619
What's up?

20:04.620 --> 20:06.663
Hey, yo, you seen Keisha?

20:06.705 --> 20:08.248
Not today.

20:08.290 --> 20:10.209
Hey, I heard y'all
got put on blast.

20:10.250 --> 20:11.627
Heh! Yeah. Now I understand

20:11.668 --> 20:13.962
why celebrities punch
paparazzi in the face.

20:14.004 --> 20:15.714
Oh, by the way, thanks for
the alley-oop with Gabby.

20:15.756 --> 20:17.758
Oh, snap. Y'all finally
got it figured out?

20:17.799 --> 20:18.383
-Yes.
-OK!

20:18.383 --> 20:20.594
So if there's anything
I can do, I owe you one.

20:20.636 --> 20:22.262
Well, actually, there is
something you can do.

20:22.304 --> 20:24.181
Tell me about
the pledging process
for KEK.

20:24.223 --> 20:25.933
You're interested in KEK?

20:25.974 --> 20:28.185
You seem like a solid
network of brothers.

20:28.227 --> 20:30.771
And, no cap, I could use
the scholarship money
y'all offer.

20:30.812 --> 20:32.731
OK. So what you
know about KEK?

20:32.773 --> 20:36.068
Well, you were
founded in 1910 by
the Fearless Five:

20:36.109 --> 20:38.028
Keenan Pruitt,
Thaddeus John,

20:38.070 --> 20:39.821
J.C. Kirkwood,
Wilton Robb,

20:39.863 --> 20:42.616
and Luciano Oakes
on the principles
of education...

20:42.658 --> 20:45.410
Both: Community, social,
and financial empowerment.

20:45.452 --> 20:46.995
-OK.
-Mm-hmm.

20:47.037 --> 20:48.747
So you read the website.

20:48.789 --> 20:50.958
No, no, bro. I'm--
I'm dead serious.

20:50.999 --> 20:55.254
KEK ain't some club
that you join just
'cause it seems cool.

20:55.295 --> 20:57.339
It's a lifelong commitment.

20:57.381 --> 20:59.716
We need brothers who are
down for the right reasons,
and that don't seem like you.

20:59.758 --> 21:01.760
I'll catch you
later, though.

21:11.019 --> 21:13.814
Come on, bro. This a bit
dramatic, don't you think?

21:13.855 --> 21:16.358
Y'all are right.

21:16.400 --> 21:19.152
I'm the sun that burns
everything around me.

21:19.194 --> 21:21.321
Man, today was wild
within itself.

21:21.363 --> 21:22.781
What happened wasn't on you.

21:22.823 --> 21:24.992
And how can you
even say that?

21:25.033 --> 21:28.203
This is the second time
that I have interfered
in Lando's life.

21:28.245 --> 21:31.665
Simone is being
punished more
because I came here.

21:31.707 --> 21:33.667
Trying to help the team
made it worse,

21:33.709 --> 21:35.419
and now Coach Marcus
is mad at me.

21:35.460 --> 21:37.254
How is none of that
on me?

21:37.296 --> 21:39.589
I mean...
[Sighs]

21:47.764 --> 21:49.182
Hey.

21:49.224 --> 21:50.434
Hey.

21:50.475 --> 21:53.020
I wanted to check
on you.

21:53.061 --> 21:55.439
You know you could've just
told me about the drug test.

21:55.480 --> 21:57.441
Yeah. But I guess
I just didn't want you

21:57.482 --> 21:59.234
to think less of me.

21:59.276 --> 22:01.570
That's never gonna
happen, all right?

22:01.611 --> 22:03.530
You can talk to me
about anything.

22:03.572 --> 22:04.489
Are you OK?

22:04.531 --> 22:06.825
Yeah. It's just...

22:06.867 --> 22:08.243
been a day.

22:08.285 --> 22:09.953
Yeah. I saw the news.

22:09.995 --> 22:11.747
Why'd you freeze up
in front of the reporters?

22:11.788 --> 22:14.249
I guess I'm just not
comfortable being
the story.

22:14.291 --> 22:16.418
I barely kept it
together for the HBCU
showcase interviews

22:16.460 --> 22:18.587
last semester.

22:18.628 --> 22:20.672
Well, if you want to be
an ace pitcher,
you got to get over that.

22:20.714 --> 22:23.091
I hear you got some
public speaking
coming up, too.

22:23.133 --> 22:25.886
Yeah. My tribunal
is tomorrow,

22:25.927 --> 22:29.806
and I don't have enough
evidence to prove that
I'm innocent.

22:29.848 --> 22:32.809
But if I cancel,
then it'll just confirm
that I'm guilty.

22:32.851 --> 22:35.062
If you get up there
in front of everybody
with nothing to say--

22:35.103 --> 22:37.939
I'll look stupid,
so either way.

22:37.981 --> 22:41.234
Well, something tells me
you're gonna find a way
to pull this off.

22:44.529 --> 22:46.448
Ooh, bitch,
when I tell you--

22:47.282 --> 22:48.617
My bad.

22:49.951 --> 22:51.703
You're home early.

22:51.745 --> 22:54.915
I love my family,
but a cabin in
the woods ain't it.

22:54.956 --> 22:56.750
No reception for
two days,

22:56.792 --> 22:58.627
so what'd I miss?

22:58.668 --> 23:00.253
Well, Keisha is M.I.A.
'cause of dance.

23:00.295 --> 23:02.089
The baseball team is
in yet another scandal.

23:02.130 --> 23:05.509
Oh, and my drug test
came back positive
for weed.

23:05.550 --> 23:07.469
I left you heifers
alone for two days.

23:07.511 --> 23:09.930
And you positive for
weed? That's my bag.

23:09.971 --> 23:12.933
I know. I still
don't know how it
got in my system.

23:14.726 --> 23:18.271
Simone, did you
use this?

23:18.313 --> 23:20.607
Yeah, a few times.
I ran out. Why?

23:20.649 --> 23:23.443
Your mystery's solved.
This is THC-infused
lotion.

23:23.485 --> 23:26.113
What?! So I dosed myself.

23:26.154 --> 23:27.447
Nathaniel: Yeah.
With my lotion.

23:27.489 --> 23:31.201
[Cell phones chiming]

23:32.202 --> 23:33.787
[Sobbing softly]

23:33.829 --> 23:35.622
Cam, what happened?

23:35.664 --> 23:39.042
I found her like this.
I've been trying to calm
her down, but I can't.

23:39.084 --> 23:41.420
Kee, honey,
what's going on?

23:41.461 --> 23:43.380
I can't. I can't.
I can't.

23:43.422 --> 23:45.257
I'm so tired.

23:45.298 --> 23:48.135
Nathaniel:
Breathe, baby girl.
We're all here for you.

23:48.176 --> 23:50.303
God. I'm
so scared of failing.

23:50.345 --> 23:52.764
I've been working so hard.

23:52.806 --> 23:54.433
[Shudders]
Everything hurts.

23:54.474 --> 23:56.309
[Inhales deeply, exhales]

23:56.351 --> 23:58.311
I've been so focused
on my own stuff,

23:58.353 --> 24:00.105
I didn't even notice.

24:00.147 --> 24:01.898
Kee, I'm so sorry.

24:01.940 --> 24:03.692
Yeah. I think we
all been caught up.

24:04.276 --> 24:07.195
Come on, guys. Things ain't
been the same since--

24:07.237 --> 24:09.197
We lost family dinner.

24:09.239 --> 24:10.991
I mean, let's be honest.

24:11.032 --> 24:13.577
We seen each other,
but we ain't really been
seeing each other.

24:16.455 --> 24:18.748
I'm calling my mom.

24:18.790 --> 24:21.293
[Knock on door]

24:25.714 --> 24:27.632
I know I'm overstepping,
and family dinners

24:27.674 --> 24:29.801
aren't your thing
anymore, but...

24:29.843 --> 24:31.636
look at them.

24:35.056 --> 24:36.433
You can't take away
their home

24:36.475 --> 24:38.935
and expect them not
to fall apart.

24:43.607 --> 24:44.900
[Chuckles]

25:02.209 --> 25:04.669
[Music playing,
indistinct conversations]

25:04.711 --> 25:06.463
How mad are you?

25:06.505 --> 25:09.216
I'm not. You did
the right thing.

25:09.257 --> 25:10.675
[Tina chuckles]

25:11.927 --> 25:14.846
Ooh, why don't you
let me take this over?

25:14.888 --> 25:20.560
It looks like they
could use their
auntie right now.

25:20.602 --> 25:21.978
Love you.

25:22.020 --> 25:23.647
Love you.

25:26.274 --> 25:29.402
Anything I can do
to help?

25:29.444 --> 25:32.447
This is
Dr. P. talking,
not the president.

25:32.489 --> 25:35.867
It's her dance professor.
She's crazy.

25:35.909 --> 25:38.537
You mind if I talk
to her alone?

25:48.755 --> 25:51.591
[Sniffles]

25:51.633 --> 25:54.094
Dr. Pace is...

25:54.135 --> 25:57.013
all-encompassing.

25:57.055 --> 25:59.724
All I ever do is
focus on her class,

25:59.766 --> 26:02.811
and I still don't feel
like I'm good enough for her.

26:02.852 --> 26:05.438
Maybe I'm just not
good enough.

26:05.480 --> 26:10.277
Mm-mm. First, let's get
that negative thought
out of your head.

26:10.318 --> 26:15.031
Second, Keisha,
you are good enough.

26:15.073 --> 26:17.534
I understand
chasing excellence,

26:17.576 --> 26:19.411
but you're
burning out quickly.

26:19.452 --> 26:21.705
You have to find
balance, sweetheart.

26:21.746 --> 26:24.040
Make time for yourself.

26:24.082 --> 26:28.169
Excellence isn't about
giving everything
you have to give.

26:28.211 --> 26:32.924
It's about giving
the best that you
have to give.

26:37.846 --> 26:39.431
Keisha's a mess right now.

26:39.472 --> 26:41.558
Her professor got her
questioning who she is

26:41.600 --> 26:43.018
and what she brings
to the table.

26:43.059 --> 26:45.395
As if she ain't perfect
just the way she is.

26:45.437 --> 26:47.022
It's crazy, man.

26:47.063 --> 26:49.482
Just like it's crazy for you
to question all that you are.

26:49.524 --> 26:52.736
Damon, all that
sun-orbit stuff is true.

26:52.777 --> 26:54.738
Like I told you, I've felt
the heat before.

26:54.779 --> 26:57.240
But ain't nothing wrong
with that.

26:57.282 --> 27:00.285
There is if
I'm hurting people or
if I dim their light.

27:00.327 --> 27:02.579
Bro, it ain't your job
to please everybody
in your orbit

27:02.621 --> 27:03.955
or manage our emotions.

27:03.997 --> 27:06.249
We'll be all right
because, yes, Damon Sims,

27:06.291 --> 27:09.294
you are that sun, but you
ain't got a monopoly on that.

27:09.336 --> 27:11.921
It's our job to find
our own sunshine,

27:11.963 --> 27:14.799
not make you feel guilty
for burning bright.

27:18.261 --> 27:19.846
What's up with Cam?

27:19.888 --> 27:21.306
Did we, like, do
something to him?

27:21.348 --> 27:23.058
No, not you.

27:23.099 --> 27:25.310
He's probably mad at
me because he expressed
interest in KEK,

27:25.352 --> 27:27.312
and I called him out for it
for not really being down

27:27.354 --> 27:29.314
and just wanting
our scholarship money.

27:29.356 --> 27:31.900
But ain't that money
something y'all promote
as a selling point?

27:31.941 --> 27:34.110
Yeah, bro, but that
can't be the only reason.

27:34.152 --> 27:36.946
Look, this is my first line.
I just can't let anybody on.

27:36.988 --> 27:40.492
We need dudes who are loyal,
trustworthy, mature,

27:40.533 --> 27:42.786
brothers who got that
intangible KEK spirit,

27:42.827 --> 27:45.330
who won't give up when
their back's against the wall.

27:45.372 --> 27:49.084
All right. Look,
I don't know about
the intangibles,

27:49.125 --> 27:52.587
but everything you just
listed describes Cam.

27:52.629 --> 27:54.964
Maybe it's on you
to show Cam that

27:55.006 --> 27:57.926
there's more to KEK
than just money.

27:59.511 --> 28:03.139
I'm sorry that I haven't been
there lately for both y'all.

28:03.181 --> 28:05.809
Child, hush.
We're all good.

28:05.850 --> 28:07.936
No. I said that I would
be there

28:07.977 --> 28:09.604
when things with Nico
went south,

28:09.646 --> 28:11.147
and I wasn't.

28:11.189 --> 28:13.483
I'm sorry.

28:13.525 --> 28:15.402
Yeah. I mean, what
happened to us?

28:15.902 --> 28:18.822
Because I've barely
been there for
you, too, Nate.

28:18.863 --> 28:21.491
I mean, yeah,
life was lifing,

28:21.533 --> 28:24.160
but, like,
it's just no excuse.

28:24.202 --> 28:27.497
It's hard to be
there for someone
when they disappear.

28:27.539 --> 28:29.416
I thought the cabin
would help,

28:29.457 --> 28:32.919
but it's--it's different
this time around.

28:32.961 --> 28:36.005
Because you saw the red flags
and ignored them?

28:38.633 --> 28:43.888
Finding love can be hard
for someone like me.

28:43.930 --> 28:48.226
It doesn't come
as often or as easy

28:48.268 --> 28:49.853
as it may for others.

28:49.894 --> 28:55.108
So that's why I didn't
want to let it go.

28:55.150 --> 29:00.196
But breaking up with Nico,
that--that was
the right decision.

29:00.238 --> 29:03.992
Nate, you can skip
my tribunal tomorrow.

29:04.033 --> 29:08.580
As SGA president,
Nico has to be
on the panel.

29:08.621 --> 29:11.082
No. I'll be there.

29:12.751 --> 29:15.545
We'll all
be there.

29:15.587 --> 29:16.921
[Chuckles]

29:16.963 --> 29:20.884
Well, I planned to
defend my innocence,

29:20.925 --> 29:23.803
but I guess
that's out.

29:23.845 --> 29:29.017
I accidentally used Nate's
THC-infused lotion.

29:29.058 --> 29:31.269
I'm sorry, Miss Tina.

29:31.311 --> 29:33.480
Well, at least
we know now

29:33.521 --> 29:36.483
what happened, and
it was an accident.

29:36.524 --> 29:39.444
But I have to talk in front
of the whole school tomorrow.

29:39.486 --> 29:42.447
I'm gonna look like
a fool, Mom.

29:42.489 --> 29:45.992
Honey, can I give you
some advice?

29:46.034 --> 29:47.952
[Exhales]
Yeah.

29:47.994 --> 29:52.248
When all you have left
at your disposal
is the truth,

29:52.290 --> 29:55.001
stand on that.

29:57.962 --> 29:59.088
Hey. Ha ha.

29:59.130 --> 30:00.882
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

30:00.924 --> 30:03.468
All good. This was
very last minute.

30:03.510 --> 30:07.013
Wow. That's a sight
for sore eyes--

30:07.055 --> 30:08.848
them happy, laughing.

30:08.890 --> 30:10.183
Amara: Yeah. They
really needed this.

30:10.225 --> 30:12.227
Marcus: Of course they did.

30:12.268 --> 30:15.814
These family dinners are

Amara: None of this
changes the fact that

30:17.941 --> 30:21.110
as Bringston's president,
these dinners are
preferential treatment.

30:21.152 --> 30:24.489
Yeah. If only you knew
someone that was creative

30:24.531 --> 30:27.826
to find a way to not
make that the case. Heh!

and creative person.

30:53.309 --> 30:56.813
the whole
press conference
situation, Coach.

30:56.855 --> 30:59.858
I just--I don't know--
I lost my cool.

30:59.899 --> 31:01.734
Look, you were defending
your team, Damon.

31:01.776 --> 31:03.736
I respect that.

31:03.778 --> 31:06.698
In today's media landscape
when you defend yourself,

31:06.739 --> 31:08.616
you end up looking
defensive.

31:08.658 --> 31:10.326
And on the other side
of the TV,

31:10.368 --> 31:14.247
when they want us
to go low, that's when
we go high, son, OK?

31:14.289 --> 31:15.999
And we got to stay there.

31:16.040 --> 31:18.710
I just don't know
why they can't
see what we see--

31:18.751 --> 31:20.712
the team as a family,

31:20.753 --> 31:22.672
the history,
HBCU legacy,

31:22.714 --> 31:26.175
the feeling of, like,
belonging somewhere.

31:26.217 --> 31:28.261
They don't want to see it.

31:28.303 --> 31:30.013
I just wish that there
was a way that we

31:30.054 --> 31:32.849
could, you know, control
our own narrative.

31:32.891 --> 31:34.517
Actually,
I think there is.

31:34.559 --> 31:36.519

[Knock on door]

31:52.493 --> 31:53.870
Thank you.

31:53.912 --> 31:55.580
I thought y'all were--

31:55.622 --> 31:58.291
Yeah. I just wanted
to stop by and wish
you good luck today.

31:58.333 --> 32:01.085
Well, seeing your
face does make me
feel better, so...

32:01.127 --> 32:02.337
thank you.

32:02.378 --> 32:06.633
Honestly, seeing yours
does the same.

32:06.674 --> 32:10.053
I just wish I could
play baseball without
all this media stuff.

32:10.094 --> 32:12.805
Well, what if you
have something to say
that people need to hear?

32:12.847 --> 32:15.892
You have nothing to hide.
Tell your story.

32:15.934 --> 32:17.894
Is that what you
plan to do?

32:17.936 --> 32:20.563
Well, unlike you, I'm
technically not innocent.

32:20.605 --> 32:25.151
I'm actually terrified
about what this means
for my tennis future.

32:26.277 --> 32:28.529
All right. Listen,

32:28.571 --> 32:32.241
a really smart,
beautiful woman
just said to me

32:32.283 --> 32:34.285
that I should consider
telling my story

32:34.327 --> 32:36.496
because someone
out there might
need to hear it.

32:36.537 --> 32:38.623
So if I'm being called
to something bigger
than myself,

32:38.665 --> 32:41.709
maybe your truth
ain't just about you.

32:52.387 --> 32:54.931
Yo, uh...

32:54.973 --> 32:58.059
since we got a minute,
I wanted to say

32:58.101 --> 33:00.103
I can't apologize for
who I am, man,

33:00.144 --> 33:03.398
or for the decisions
that people make
because of it,

33:03.439 --> 33:05.733
but I never wanted things
to go down bad for you.

33:08.027 --> 33:09.737
I appreciate that.

33:09.779 --> 33:12.031
Look, at the end
of the day,

33:12.073 --> 33:14.951
I ended up exactly
where I needed to be--

33:14.993 --> 33:16.035
Bringston.

33:16.077 --> 33:18.204
Santiago:
We all did.

33:18.246 --> 33:21.124
J.R.: We just got
to hip the rest of
the world to that.

I want to introduce
you to an old friend,

the facts straight,

in his own power.

33:33.511 --> 33:34.595
That's Reggie Bush!

33:34.637 --> 33:35.763

about that,

33:43.354 --> 33:44.689
so let's clear the air.

33:45.857 --> 33:47.567
There it is. Come on.

we heard about you
and Damon.

33:52.822 --> 33:55.158
You're gonna be OK.
You know that, right?

33:55.199 --> 33:58.494
Yeah, I know, but it
doesn't hurt to hear it
from other people.

33:58.536 --> 34:01.706
And the first session
of the newly single

now you can focus on
tennis, 10 toes down.

for showing up

34:30.401 --> 34:32.570
and hearing what I have
to say.

34:32.612 --> 34:34.405
Reggie Bush: Damon Sims,

34:34.447 --> 34:35.698
the sports community
has been waiting

34:35.740 --> 34:37.492
for the answer
to one question.

34:37.533 --> 34:39.494
Yeah, Mr. Bush, um,
but before we get there,

34:39.535 --> 34:41.370
there is something
I want to confess.

34:41.412 --> 34:45.374
I asked for this tribunal
to prove my innocence,

34:45.416 --> 34:49.212
but the truth is I put
THC in my system.

34:49.253 --> 34:51.464
[Spectators murmuring]

34:51.506 --> 34:53.758
It was an honest mistake,

34:53.800 --> 34:55.968
but it doesn't matter.

34:56.010 --> 34:58.846
Rules are different for
athletes that look like me.

34:58.888 --> 35:00.598
There's a higher standard
that's put on us.

35:00.640 --> 35:02.517
And these rules are designed

35:02.558 --> 35:04.811
to disproportionately affect
our communities.

35:04.852 --> 35:08.314
Damon: So we look for safe
places that are just for us,

35:08.356 --> 35:11.109
where we don't feel like
we're being punished just
because we have a pulse.

35:11.150 --> 35:13.361
Simone: But then the outside
world attacks us there, too.

35:13.402 --> 35:16.239
My integrity and the integrity
of this institution

35:16.280 --> 35:18.241
was questioned by the media.

35:18.282 --> 35:19.826
Because people
can't understand why
a great athlete

35:19.867 --> 35:22.703
would choose an HBCU
like Bringston.

35:22.745 --> 35:25.081
Nobody asks why students
choose to go to Harvard

35:25.123 --> 35:27.041
or Stanford or
the University
of Georgia, right?

35:27.083 --> 35:29.669
We shouldn't have
to explain or apologize

35:29.710 --> 35:31.671
for taking our talents
to an HBCU.

35:31.712 --> 35:34.715
Simone: But our own
institutions shouldn't
attack us from within

35:34.757 --> 35:37.677
when we do, using
the same archaic rules

35:37.718 --> 35:39.846
that are used against us
by the majority.

35:39.887 --> 35:42.598
THC is not
performance enhancing,

35:42.640 --> 35:44.684
and it shouldn't be banned.

35:44.725 --> 35:47.436
At the very least,
the harshest penalty

35:47.478 --> 35:49.522
shouldn't be applied
for its use.

35:49.564 --> 35:52.233
And Bringston is a place
where we can be
a part of that change.

35:52.275 --> 35:55.486
Simone: And sometimes
change is necessary,

35:55.528 --> 35:58.322
when we realize
old rules no longer serve

35:58.364 --> 36:00.950
our best interests, especially
when they're perpetuating

36:00.992 --> 36:03.578
the same rules that
were originally designed

36:03.619 --> 36:05.371
to tear our communities apart,

36:05.413 --> 36:09.083
the kind of rules that sent our
brothers and sisters to prison

36:09.125 --> 36:10.877
for now-legal substances.

36:10.918 --> 36:13.004
I came to Bringston because
I wanted something more,

36:13.045 --> 36:15.631
something special,
that wouldn't just
make me a better athlete

36:15.673 --> 36:17.717
but a whole person.

36:17.758 --> 36:20.261
So the question isn't
"Why Bringston?"

36:20.303 --> 36:22.805
The question should
be, Why not Bringston?

36:22.847 --> 36:25.183
Lando: No other place
can take care of my
being inside and out

36:25.224 --> 36:27.351
like this school.

36:27.393 --> 36:30.438
And I hope that what I've
said helps you see that

36:30.479 --> 36:32.106
what we have here
is really special.

36:32.148 --> 36:35.985
So how we govern ourselves
has to be different, too.

president
isn't about ego,

[Taps microphone]

37:32.083 --> 37:33.668
Excuse me.

37:33.709 --> 37:36.963
Bringston is an institution
of higher learning,

37:37.004 --> 37:40.758
and it's not just the students
who learn here.

37:41.384 --> 37:44.887
I intended to make
an example out of you today.

37:44.929 --> 37:48.266
I was so worried about how
things looked on the outside

37:48.307 --> 37:52.687
that I didn't see how things
are on the inside.

37:52.728 --> 37:55.356
Your words moved me, Ms. Hicks.

37:55.398 --> 37:59.360
And I promise you, Dr. Patterson
and I will work together

37:59.402 --> 38:02.196
to make sure that there are
administrative changes

38:02.238 --> 38:03.990
to these arcane rules.

38:04.031 --> 38:08.119

that were already in place,

38:08.160 --> 38:09.870
