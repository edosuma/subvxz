00:01.062 --> 00:02.612
Previously on Teen Wolf...

00:02.636 --> 00:05.248
There can be multiple sets
of DNA in the same individual.

00:05.272 --> 00:08.385
Chimera. It's a creature
made of incongruous parts.

00:08.409 --> 00:10.409
Tracy's not the only one.

00:11.779 --> 00:13.112
Kira!

00:15.149 --> 00:17.461
If you want to cause
Stilinski emotional pain...

00:17.485 --> 00:19.251
You go after someone he loves.

01:57.585 --> 01:59.184
You dropped your phone.

02:01.489 --> 02:04.223
It's Malia.
Should I text her back?

02:06.527 --> 02:10.294
You don't really know who I
am, do you, Stiles?

02:11.398 --> 02:15.212
Maybe you heard about my father.

02:15.236 --> 02:17.714
Did your dad tell you about him?

02:17.738 --> 02:21.485
Did Sheriff Stilinski ever tell you
about the time he was still deputy

02:21.509 --> 02:23.854
and how his partner got caught
in a shoot-out?

02:23.878 --> 02:27.657
Did he tell you a bullet
shattered my dad's T-9 vertebra?

02:27.681 --> 02:31.595
Went right through his spinal
cord? Know what that means?

02:31.619 --> 02:36.788
It means everything below his
waist is useless. And not just his legs.

02:38.359 --> 02:41.404
I bet he told you some of it.

02:41.428 --> 02:43.640
But I bet he probably
left out the part where he was

02:43.664 --> 02:48.300
sitting in a car calling for backup
while my dad was going in alone.

02:49.470 --> 02:52.215
Did he tell you
that he was too scared,

02:52.239 --> 02:55.318
too much of a frightened
little bitch to go in after him?

02:55.342 --> 02:59.611
Or do scared little bitches not tell their
little bitch sons about their failures?

03:01.949 --> 03:05.384
About how they put their partner in
a wheelchair for the rest of his life?

03:57.404 --> 04:00.784
Don't worry, Stiles.
I'm not gonna kill you...

04:00.808 --> 04:02.374
I'm just gonna eat your legs.

05:55.589 --> 05:58.657
9-1-1, what is your emergency?

05:59.827 --> 06:02.394
9-1-1, please state your
emergency.

06:05.432 --> 06:09.012
You've reached 9-1-1, this
line is for emergencies only.

06:09.036 --> 06:12.471
If you do not have an
emergency, please hang up.

06:15.576 --> 06:17.721
Want me to send a car
out? What's the address?

06:17.745 --> 06:19.956
It's the school.
Beacon Hills High.

06:19.980 --> 06:21.747
Let's see if we
got a car in the area.

09:34.608 --> 09:41.057
I'm 10-97 and there's
no one here. It's a 653.

09:41.081 --> 09:44.149
Roger that. It's a prank
call. Return to your patrol.

11:09.369 --> 11:12.982
What's wrong? It's the
alarm at the Animal Clinic.

11:13.006 --> 11:14.039
I think it's a break-in.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.680
Scott?

13:08.704 --> 13:10.487
Stiles, someone's
taking the bodies.

13:17.063 --> 13:19.297
Stiles? You there? Yeah. Um...

13:20.467 --> 13:22.811
Where? What are
you talking about?

13:22.835 --> 13:25.181
I'm at the Animal Clinic with
Kira. Tracy's body is gone.

13:25.205 --> 13:28.017
The lock on the door
was broken from the outside.

13:28.041 --> 13:31.053
And my mom just told me Lucas's
body went missing from the morgue.

13:31.077 --> 13:33.156
They've been searching the
whole hospital for it.

13:33.180 --> 13:35.446
Someone's stealing the bodies.

14:05.478 --> 14:08.246
The Dread Doctors
by T.R. McCammon.

14:09.382 --> 14:10.493
What?

14:10.517 --> 14:14.497
I don't know. There's
something about it.

14:14.521 --> 14:17.133
Has anyone actually read it yet?

14:17.157 --> 14:20.069
Just me. And I didn't
understand any of it.

14:20.093 --> 14:22.260
We should probably all
read it. Kira's working on that.

14:25.565 --> 14:27.465
Done? Done.

14:29.169 --> 14:30.913
Sorry.

14:30.937 --> 14:36.219
Stiles says he can't find anything on
the author. He thinks it's a pen name.

14:36.243 --> 14:41.958
"In a small New England town, teenagers
are taken in the night and buried alive.

14:41.982 --> 14:46.229
"Days later they emerge transformed,
wreaking havoc and spreading terror,

14:46.253 --> 14:49.465
"commanded by an ancient order
of parascientists known only as

14:49.489 --> 14:51.589
"the Dread Doctors."

14:53.660 --> 14:57.974
Sounds vaguely familiar.
How does it end?

14:57.998 --> 15:01.210
It doesn't. This is
supposed to be volume one.

15:01.234 --> 15:03.279
Oh, let me guess...
There is no volume two?

15:03.303 --> 15:05.214
I think we're living volume two.

15:05.238 --> 15:06.883
Then maybe the real
question is...

15:06.907 --> 15:12.421
Is this a novel
or someone's prediction?

15:12.445 --> 15:15.157
I don't think the Dread Doctors
are the ones stealing the bodies.

15:15.181 --> 15:17.025
Are we really calling them that?

15:17.049 --> 15:18.895
Think about it. They killed
Tracy and walked away.

15:18.919 --> 15:20.929
They killed Lucas
and walked away.

15:20.953 --> 15:22.965
Why would they leave and
come back to take the bodies?

15:22.989 --> 15:25.067
Someone else has
to be taking them.

15:25.091 --> 15:27.904
But the bodies aren't
just bodies. They're...

15:27.928 --> 15:30.672
They're failures.

15:30.696 --> 15:33.442
So if the Chimeras are all failures,
what's the success going to be?

15:33.466 --> 15:35.333
Bad. Probably really bad.

15:40.373 --> 15:41.617
What's wrong?

15:41.641 --> 15:42.974
I thought I smelled blood.

15:48.081 --> 15:51.015
I don't know. Maybe not.

15:55.021 --> 15:59.435
Sorry, but I'd never even heard
of the Kanima until a few days ago.

15:59.459 --> 16:01.504
You want me to read this?

16:01.528 --> 16:04.062
Well, not yet. I'm still
only on chapter one.

16:04.731 --> 16:06.542
You guys do this a lot, huh?

16:06.566 --> 16:08.333
Do what? Get involved.

16:10.437 --> 16:12.070
Yeah, I guess.

16:13.373 --> 16:15.350
What about the author?

16:15.374 --> 16:17.351
If he knew all about these guys,
shouldn't we be talking to him?

16:17.375 --> 16:19.535
We thought about that, but
it's pretty much a dead end.

16:22.415 --> 16:23.415
What about this guy?

16:28.688 --> 16:30.982
Why is your heart
beating so fast?

16:31.006 --> 16:33.302
Look at this. Look at the
"Acknowledgements" page.

16:33.326 --> 16:35.004
"For providing
scientific perspective

16:35.028 --> 16:37.506
"and invaluable insight...

16:37.530 --> 16:40.031
"this book is dedicated
to Dr. Gabriel Valack."

16:40.734 --> 16:42.467
Do you know him? Yeah.

16:44.604 --> 16:46.070
And I know where to find him.

16:51.244 --> 16:52.454
The book worked.

16:52.478 --> 16:53.878
And now they're going
to see Valack.

16:57.350 --> 16:58.394
They're going tonight.

16:58.418 --> 17:00.184
To Eichen.

17:18.621 --> 17:20.171
Lydia, I'm going with you.

17:21.207 --> 17:23.602
I thought you said
you were sick.

17:23.626 --> 17:26.021
I'm slightly under the weather.
You don't have to come.

17:26.046 --> 17:28.140
Malia's not going either.

17:28.164 --> 17:30.259
Malia's not going because she knows
that that place is a nightmare asylum

17:30.283 --> 17:32.561
of insanity and death, okay?

17:32.585 --> 17:33.818
Let's go.

17:36.456 --> 17:37.655
What was that?

17:40.493 --> 17:42.505
What was what? You winced.

17:42.529 --> 17:43.606
I have a bad elbow.

17:43.630 --> 17:45.441
It was your shoulder.

17:45.465 --> 17:46.731
Pain radiates. It does that.

17:51.420 --> 17:52.681
You are not going without me.

17:52.705 --> 17:55.284
You remember what happened to
Deaton when he talked to Valack?

17:55.308 --> 17:57.520
Scott and Kira
are going to be there.

17:57.544 --> 17:59.071
Okay. I'm not letting
you go to a place

17:59.095 --> 18:00.623
where one of the orderlies
almost killed you.

18:00.647 --> 18:02.525
He almost killed you too.

18:02.549 --> 18:04.315
And we're both still
alive. See? Teamwork.

18:08.688 --> 18:10.399
I don't see it anywhere.

18:10.423 --> 18:12.735
I left it here. I know I did.

18:12.759 --> 18:16.272
When we woke up, you said
"Don't forget your belt."

18:16.296 --> 18:18.429
Are you sure? I don't
remember saying that.

18:19.632 --> 18:22.333
You don't remember
saying a lot of things.

18:25.138 --> 18:26.270
What's that supposed mean?

18:27.307 --> 18:28.818
It means...

18:28.842 --> 18:31.776
Nothing. Forget it.

18:39.152 --> 18:40.284
You okay?

18:42.255 --> 18:45.401
Can you do me a favor?

18:45.425 --> 18:46.745
Can you look at me
with your eyes?

18:47.360 --> 18:49.138
I am.

18:49.162 --> 18:50.294
I mean, your other eyes.

19:00.707 --> 19:01.873
Just tell me what you see.

19:25.899 --> 19:27.632
What? Did you see something?

19:31.671 --> 19:34.205
Yeah. I found your belt.

19:42.715 --> 19:43.748
Everything else is fine.

19:44.551 --> 19:45.683
Ready?

19:54.594 --> 19:55.738
Hello?

19:55.762 --> 19:57.762
Anyone there?

20:01.935 --> 20:04.246
Are you going
to be okay in there?

20:04.270 --> 20:06.415
Yeah. Why? You
just seem a little off.

20:06.439 --> 20:07.917
I think we're all a little off.

20:07.941 --> 20:09.440
Maybe some of us
more than others.

20:13.746 --> 20:15.413
Wait. What happened?

20:16.416 --> 20:18.961
When the other Chimera, Lucas,

20:18.985 --> 20:22.398
when he came after us,

20:22.422 --> 20:24.633
I heard Kira say
something in Japanese.

20:24.657 --> 20:27.636
That doesn't sound too bad.
She doesn't know any Japanese.

20:27.660 --> 20:30.673
Still not terrible.

20:30.697 --> 20:32.937
I also think I might have
stopped her from killing Lucas.

20:33.733 --> 20:35.299
Okay.

20:37.437 --> 20:38.981
Wasn't he trying
to kill you, though?

20:39.005 --> 20:41.550
I mean, that just sounds
like self-defense.

20:41.574 --> 20:43.619
It was more than that.

20:43.643 --> 20:45.543
I mean, she nearly
took off his head.

20:46.279 --> 20:47.890
Maybe she had no choice.

20:47.914 --> 20:52.995
There's gotta be a point
where self-defense is justified.

20:53.019 --> 20:54.997
Tracy killed her own father.

20:55.021 --> 20:57.333
And Lucas would have killed you.

20:57.357 --> 21:01.337
They're not the bad guys.
They're the victims.

21:01.361 --> 21:03.642
We shouldn't be killing the
people we're supposed to save.

21:34.894 --> 21:37.105
Please empty your pockets
into the container.

21:37.129 --> 21:39.729
We're here to see... Please empty
your pockets into the container.

21:50.410 --> 21:53.689
Please remove your belt and
place it into the container.

21:53.713 --> 21:56.659
I kind of need the belt. I
mean, it's crucial to the outfit.

21:56.683 --> 21:59.795
Please remove your belt which
patients will attempt to take from you

21:59.819 --> 22:02.865
and use to strangle
either themselves or others.

22:02.889 --> 22:04.488
Right. Got it.

22:28.781 --> 22:31.627
I'll remind you that I'm only
doing this as a favor to Deaton.

22:31.651 --> 22:35.364
And I'm doing it against
my better judgment.

22:35.388 --> 22:38.334
Hey, what's the etiquette
for talking to this guy?

22:38.358 --> 22:40.769
I mean, do you ever
look at the other eye?

22:40.793 --> 22:43.872
I wouldn't. In fact,
while you're down here,

22:43.896 --> 22:48.499
try not to make eye contact
with anyone or anything.

22:54.407 --> 22:55.539
Page turner?

22:57.777 --> 22:58.777
Not exactly.

23:00.380 --> 23:01.512
Neither is this.

23:27.173 --> 23:28.984
You didn't think you
were all going, did you?

23:29.008 --> 23:31.186
It's mountain ash, isn't it?

23:31.210 --> 23:33.411
Everywhere, but heavily
concentrated down here.

23:36.015 --> 23:38.616
Valack's cell is the last
one at the end of the hall.

23:40.119 --> 23:41.652
We'll be right here.

24:44.584 --> 24:45.950
Tell me what you just saw.

24:46.752 --> 24:49.347
Me?

24:49.371 --> 24:51.967
The creature in the
previous cell. The Sluagh.

24:51.991 --> 24:54.503
The myth is that they can take
on the appearance of the lost souls

24:54.527 --> 24:56.861
that have become
inextricably bound to it.

24:58.531 --> 25:01.165
Happen to see any lost
souls, Mr. Stilinski?

25:02.735 --> 25:04.813
Everyone down here.

25:04.837 --> 25:07.938
Don't give up on us yet.
We're all works-in-progress.

25:09.709 --> 25:11.119
Where did you hear that from?

25:11.143 --> 25:13.177
Wise words from
a former cellmate.

25:19.752 --> 25:21.118
Did you bring the book?

25:26.592 --> 25:30.506
Very nice. First edition.

25:30.530 --> 25:32.196
Of course, there was
only one printed.

25:34.033 --> 25:35.666
There is no
T.R. McCammon, is there?

25:35.902 --> 25:37.579
No.

25:37.603 --> 25:39.537
You wrote the book.

25:40.006 --> 25:41.149
That's right, Lydia.

25:41.173 --> 25:45.087
Maybe you've already guessed
that it's not just a book.

25:45.111 --> 25:47.388
What is it?

25:47.412 --> 25:49.691
A tool. Designed
to open your eyes.

25:49.715 --> 25:51.148
To what?

25:51.751 --> 25:53.250
To them.

25:54.320 --> 25:55.819
The Dread Doctors.

26:04.664 --> 26:08.143
Need a ride? I can take the bus.

26:08.167 --> 26:09.767
Last one left an hour ago.

26:12.104 --> 26:14.305
I'll walk. Haven't I seen you
coming out of Driver's Ed?

26:15.942 --> 26:18.436
I hope not.

26:18.460 --> 26:20.956
I'm pretty sure I saw you destroy a
couple traffic cones the other day.

26:20.980 --> 26:22.891
And nearly take out a sophomore.

26:22.915 --> 26:24.835
The sophomore shouldn't
have been standing there.

26:28.054 --> 26:31.689
Sounds like you could, uh,
still use some practice.

26:41.100 --> 26:45.013
Why did you use a pseudonym? I
had a professional reputation once.

26:45.037 --> 26:48.684
I wasn't interested in ruining it by putting
my name on a second-rate piece of trash.

26:48.708 --> 26:50.719
Then why write the book
in the first place?

26:50.743 --> 26:52.643
You haven't read
it yet, have you?

26:54.213 --> 26:56.747
I wrote it because
no one believed me.

26:58.084 --> 26:59.183
Because no one listened.

27:02.288 --> 27:03.854
They're here, aren't they?

27:05.157 --> 27:06.223
In Beacon Hills.

27:07.927 --> 27:10.355
What are they?

27:10.379 --> 27:12.808
Not entirely human.
At least, not anymore.

27:12.832 --> 27:16.645
They were scientists once. Scientists
who worshipped the supernatural.

27:16.669 --> 27:19.815
Tesla said, "If you want to
find the secrets of the universe,

27:19.839 --> 27:22.851
"think in terms of energy,
frequency and vibration."

27:22.875 --> 27:25.687
They found their secrets
in electromagnetic forces.

27:25.711 --> 27:29.091
Ways to prolong their lives,
give them power,

27:29.115 --> 27:33.083
and most importantly, making
you forget you ever saw them.

27:33.819 --> 27:35.097
What do they want?

27:35.121 --> 27:36.098
Good question, Lydia.

27:36.122 --> 27:39.690
Everybody wants
something, don't they?

27:41.293 --> 27:43.060
Okay, so what do you want?

27:48.901 --> 27:49.901
Hit record.

27:52.004 --> 27:53.348
What do you want me to say?

27:53.372 --> 27:54.972
I don't want you
to say anything.

27:55.408 --> 27:56.807
I want you to scream.

28:05.217 --> 28:08.230
I can't hear anything.

28:08.254 --> 28:09.286
Must be the mountain ash.

28:09.955 --> 28:11.299
I feel it too.

28:11.323 --> 28:14.102
To be honest,
I feel a little weak.

28:14.126 --> 28:16.438
Yeah, it's like being sedated.

28:16.462 --> 28:18.829
This was a bad idea, wasn't it?

28:20.800 --> 28:26.014
They'll be okay without
us. And those two...

28:26.038 --> 28:28.072
They're pretty good together.

28:29.075 --> 28:30.452
Yeah, they are.

28:30.476 --> 28:37.259
No super strength or samurai
swords, but they stay alive.

28:37.283 --> 28:40.028
He still likes her, doesn't he?

28:40.052 --> 28:43.265
Yeah. Yeah,
but it's different now.

28:43.289 --> 28:46.268
I mean, you should've seen
the way he used to be around her.

28:46.292 --> 28:47.791
Was it bad?

28:49.261 --> 28:52.930
He was kind of obsessive,
but not all bad.

28:54.734 --> 28:57.212
You know, Lydia used to
pretend not to be smart.

28:57.236 --> 28:58.947
Our Lydia?

28:58.971 --> 29:01.249
Yeah, Stiles was
the only one who knew.

29:01.273 --> 29:03.373
How? He paid attention.

29:04.376 --> 29:06.343
He listened to her.

29:07.480 --> 29:09.213
He remembered...

29:17.289 --> 29:18.822
Did you see that?

29:20.326 --> 29:23.393
No, but I am seeing this.

29:32.138 --> 29:34.204
No way. Not happening. Sorry.

29:37.910 --> 29:40.055
He's the only one
that knows anything.

29:40.079 --> 29:42.758
The guy is a nut-job who
drilled a hole into his head.

29:42.782 --> 29:44.126
He's probably lying his ass off.

29:44.150 --> 29:47.062
How many have died so far?

29:47.086 --> 29:48.830
All of them teenagers.
Am I right?

29:48.854 --> 29:53.001
Want to know how many died
the first time they came here?

29:53.025 --> 29:55.292
Wonder how many will
die if they succeed?

29:57.196 --> 29:59.290
This did happen before.

29:59.314 --> 30:01.409
And now they're back. All
because a few teenagers,

30:01.433 --> 30:04.446
who never even considered
the consequences,

30:04.470 --> 30:06.782
decided to reignite
a supernatural force

30:06.806 --> 30:08.416
they barely understand.

30:08.440 --> 30:10.385
The Nemeton.

30:10.409 --> 30:12.254
How do you even know about that?

30:12.278 --> 30:14.378
I know because I saw it.

30:25.424 --> 30:27.569
Kira, whatever you're doing,
please stop.

30:27.593 --> 30:29.960
I'm not doing anything.
It's just happening.

30:35.234 --> 30:36.511
Who did you come with?

30:36.535 --> 30:38.079
Our friends. What are they?

30:38.103 --> 30:39.581
Don't answer.

30:39.605 --> 30:40.938
You brought a Kitsune.

30:43.008 --> 30:44.535
What's happening?

30:44.559 --> 30:46.087
She's disrupting
the building's defenses.

30:46.111 --> 30:48.022
What do you mean? How?

30:48.046 --> 30:49.958
It's not just the mountain ash
that keeps this building secure.

30:49.982 --> 30:51.493
It's the electromagnetic energy.

30:51.517 --> 30:53.461
Eichen is built
on the convergence

30:53.485 --> 30:55.946
of Telluric currents. Ley lines.

30:55.970 --> 30:58.433
It's what allows it to keep
certain supernatural creatures in.

30:58.457 --> 31:00.324
And certain others out.

31:03.062 --> 31:04.928
They knew you were coming.

31:05.598 --> 31:06.930
They're here.

31:08.534 --> 31:10.901
And you unlocked
the door for them.

31:43.602 --> 31:45.302
We can go a little faster,

31:46.205 --> 31:47.315
if you want.

31:47.339 --> 31:49.006
I'm doing the speed limit.

31:50.075 --> 31:52.320
Nobody does the speed limit.

31:52.344 --> 31:54.978
You also don't have to
hold the wheel like that.

31:58.484 --> 32:00.250
Put your hand here.

32:04.323 --> 32:05.989
Like this.

32:10.663 --> 32:11.995
Better?

32:30.950 --> 32:33.083
Okay, I said a little faster.
Not Mach five.

32:34.520 --> 32:35.986
Malia, you okay?

32:39.091 --> 32:40.091
Hey, slow down.

32:44.330 --> 32:45.373
Malia, stop!

32:45.397 --> 32:46.397
Stop the car!

32:47.166 --> 32:48.166
Stop the car!

32:52.438 --> 32:54.171
Malia!

32:59.044 --> 33:00.243
Malia!

33:11.457 --> 33:12.723
Kira?

33:14.126 --> 33:15.126
Kira...

33:26.338 --> 33:27.471
Are you all right?

33:29.308 --> 33:30.407
Something's happening.

33:31.543 --> 33:33.076
And I think she's causing it.

33:51.296 --> 33:54.309
Hit record. Do it now.
It costs you nothing.

33:54.333 --> 33:55.459
But it's worth something to you,

33:55.483 --> 33:56.803
so you're not
getting it for free.

33:58.037 --> 33:59.236
What does the book do?

34:13.452 --> 34:15.163
Tell us. I told you.

34:15.187 --> 34:17.197
It opens your eyes. How?

34:17.222 --> 34:19.167
It triggers the memory
centers of the brain,

34:19.190 --> 34:20.735
clearing the fog
and bringing the images

34:20.759 --> 34:22.425
of the Dread Doctors into focus.

34:22.449 --> 34:24.114
I wrote the book
in an effort to find out

34:24.139 --> 34:26.059
if anyone else like me
had ever seen them before.

34:26.764 --> 34:28.726
I thought I could circulate it,

34:28.750 --> 34:30.830
an effort to trigger someone...
Anyone else's memory.

34:32.271 --> 34:34.670
They'd see the cover,
a hint of memory...

34:38.444 --> 34:40.621
They pick up the book, read it.

34:40.646 --> 34:43.024
The suppressed memory surface,

34:43.047 --> 34:45.427
and they'd find their way
to me to discover more.

34:45.451 --> 34:46.661
Just like you did.

34:46.685 --> 34:48.679
Did it work with anyone else?

34:48.703 --> 34:50.697
You didn't see it on The New
York Times Best Seller list, did you?

34:50.722 --> 34:52.750
So all we have to do
is read the book?

34:52.774 --> 34:54.803
If you've seen them, if
they've done something to you,

34:54.827 --> 34:56.704
then the book
will help you remember.

34:56.728 --> 34:57.861
Now give me what I want.

35:13.512 --> 35:15.757
We need to get her
out of here right now.

35:15.781 --> 35:17.981
Yeah well, how do we move her
if I can't even touch her?

35:39.404 --> 35:40.537
Malia?

35:42.708 --> 35:43.840
Malia.

35:45.377 --> 35:46.377
Malia.

35:59.625 --> 36:01.052
Malia, come on, get up.

36:01.076 --> 36:02.676
Malia, come on, we
gotta get up. Come on!

36:08.300 --> 36:09.277
It was her.

36:09.301 --> 36:10.578
What?

36:10.602 --> 36:12.335
It was her. She was there.

36:13.739 --> 36:14.938
Who?

36:19.511 --> 36:21.211
The Desert Wolf.

36:23.615 --> 36:25.448
I think you better run.
I can't leave her.

36:27.653 --> 36:29.286
I can.

37:09.761 --> 37:11.438
Tell us what they want.

37:11.462 --> 37:13.139
Lydia, I think we need to
get out of here.

37:13.163 --> 37:14.842
- What are they trying to do?
- Read the book.

37:14.866 --> 37:16.644
Anyone who's come
into contact with them.

37:16.668 --> 37:18.368
Lydia, we gotta go. Now.

37:20.706 --> 37:22.405
Read the book!

38:25.804 --> 38:26.844
You don't have to do this.

38:30.609 --> 38:31.609
You don't have to...

39:25.464 --> 39:26.629
At the club...

39:27.065 --> 39:29.399
At the club, you...

39:29.768 --> 39:31.000
You said...

39:31.470 --> 39:32.736
I remember.

39:35.807 --> 39:36.807
And I meant it.

40:04.069 --> 40:05.935
I think we're okay.

40:07.539 --> 40:08.916
Stiles?

40:08.940 --> 40:10.473
No, it's not okay.

40:11.777 --> 40:14.144
All of this, it's on us.

40:15.981 --> 40:17.858
Everything that's happened,

40:17.882 --> 40:19.842
everything that's going
to happen. It's our fault.

40:23.155 --> 40:25.021
It's our responsibility.
