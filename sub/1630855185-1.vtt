00:23.041 --> 00:24.083
[radio chatter]

00:24.166 --> 00:26.833
[commentator 1] Rebound for Allen.
That was a crucial grab in the third--

00:26.916 --> 00:29.041
[commentator 2] Simple rule.
Get the ball to Kamal.

00:29.125 --> 00:31.500
[commentator 3] This kid's playing
better than Kobe played in high school.

00:31.583 --> 00:33.791
[commentator 4] Allen's flying
down the court for the three. It's good!

00:33.875 --> 00:35.166
[commentator 5] We got another one, baby!

00:35.250 --> 00:38.208
[commentator 6] You've got college scouts,
you've got NBA scouts at his games now.

00:38.291 --> 00:40.791
[commentator 7] He's a very talented
young player already.

00:40.875 --> 00:43.166
In case you're not familiar
with greatness,

00:43.250 --> 00:44.833
allow me to make the introduction.

00:44.916 --> 00:46.750
I'm here with senior phenom Kamal Allen.

00:46.833 --> 00:49.916
Many consider him to be
the top prospect in the country.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.875
Averaging a double-double
with 26 points per game

00:52.958 --> 00:57.083
and coming off his second consecutive
California state championship.

00:57.166 --> 01:00.000
Along with him is his dad,
the equally famous,

01:00.083 --> 01:03.500
if not infamous, father, Benji Allen.

01:03.583 --> 01:05.208
Great to have you guys on the program.

01:05.291 --> 01:06.375
Thanks, Stan. Great to be here.

01:06.458 --> 01:09.833
And great to be introducing the world
to the next GOAT, Kamal Allen.

01:09.916 --> 01:12.291
-Time to put his name in the mix.
-Thanks for having us.

01:12.375 --> 01:15.500
There's been talk about your father's
involvement in your career.

01:15.583 --> 01:17.291
It seems he's always been there for you.

01:17.375 --> 01:19.041
Man. Yes, sir.

01:20.125 --> 01:21.166
Through thick and thin.

01:21.250 --> 01:23.500
-Hey, that's what fathers do.
-Man.

01:23.583 --> 01:25.375
I'm always going to be there
no matter what.

01:25.458 --> 01:29.083
Have you guys discussed how you're gonna
handle those long NBA seasons?

01:29.166 --> 01:32.625
Well, you know, I haven't missed a game
his whole life. I don't plan to start now.

01:32.708 --> 01:34.625
Especially if he's covering my airfare.

01:35.916 --> 01:38.041
All right. So I made a bet with your dad

01:38.125 --> 01:40.000
that you couldn't hit this shot
sitting down.

01:40.083 --> 01:42.625
So let's see here, Mr. Number One Recruit.

01:42.708 --> 01:44.500
You gonna prove me wrong here,
young fella?

01:44.583 --> 01:45.958
-He done stepped in it now.
-I guess so.

01:46.041 --> 01:49.000
Come on, come on.
Show him how we do what we do.

01:49.083 --> 01:50.625
Let's see what you got.

01:50.708 --> 01:51.791
[sighs]

01:52.333 --> 01:54.125
[Stan Verrett] Stay tuned,
we'll be right back.

01:56.625 --> 01:58.708
[player laughs]

01:58.791 --> 02:02.000
Yo, bro, that's your mans?
That boy's washed.

02:03.166 --> 02:05.958
Let's go. Game point, dog.

02:06.041 --> 02:07.291
You gonna let him disrespect you?

02:08.083 --> 02:09.291
Come on, Black man.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.208
Come on. Shit.

02:12.708 --> 02:14.708
-[player] All right. Guard him.
-[friend] Come on.

02:15.208 --> 02:17.666
Do it. Whoo!

02:19.750 --> 02:21.458
[Kamal] Don't you ever disrespect me.

02:22.583 --> 02:24.583
-It's game.
-It's win by two.

02:24.666 --> 02:26.000
Not here it's not.

02:27.500 --> 02:28.833
Dude be cheating, dog.

02:28.916 --> 02:32.208
Nah, you just weak, son.
It's all right though. Next time, man.

02:32.791 --> 02:34.125
Next time, papi!

02:34.750 --> 02:35.875
Bro, that move was cool and all,

02:35.958 --> 02:37.791
but I know you seen me wide open
in the corner, right?

02:37.875 --> 02:39.791
Yeah, I saw you.
I was just focused on winning.

02:39.875 --> 02:42.416
We trying to get ready for this
two-on-two tournament we got coming up.

02:42.500 --> 02:43.791
-You fucking that up.
-[scoffs]

02:43.875 --> 02:45.625
Y'all practicing
for a two-on-two tournament?

02:45.708 --> 02:47.333
Nigga, hell yes. What you mean?

02:47.416 --> 02:49.416
Look, grand prize is 25G

02:49.500 --> 02:52.416
plus free entry
into that big-ass tournament in Leimert

02:52.500 --> 02:53.708
where the winner gets 500,000.

02:53.791 --> 02:54.791
Come on.

02:54.875 --> 02:57.208
Hey, shit, every hooper I know
is entering that motherfucker.

02:57.291 --> 02:58.916
And if we win a half milli,

02:59.000 --> 03:01.250
maybe Speedy can stop fucking
with these chubby-ass white women

03:01.333 --> 03:02.625
that buy him general-release Jordans.

03:02.708 --> 03:05.916
Yeah, whatever, nigga. I like Mildred.
She cool.

03:06.416 --> 03:09.750
All right, look. I love y'all, man.
But what are we, 12?

03:10.583 --> 03:12.083
I ain't playing
in no two-on-two tournament.

03:12.791 --> 03:13.791
Rude.

03:14.333 --> 03:16.750
So we're at his old high school
playing pickup basketball,

03:16.833 --> 03:18.416
but he too good
for the two-on-two tournament?

03:18.500 --> 03:20.625
Tsk, tsk on this nigga.

03:20.708 --> 03:21.750
A damn shame.

03:21.833 --> 03:27.666
Being able to windmill dunk while working
a minimum wage job and smoking no weed.

03:27.750 --> 03:29.500
That sound like jail. Couldn't be me.

03:31.166 --> 03:33.375
Hey, they letting yoga instructors
in the gym now?

03:34.416 --> 03:37.750
Look, just, uh, stretch out,
play with the oversized ball.

03:37.833 --> 03:39.125
Are you kidding me?

03:39.208 --> 03:42.875
Columbus must think he found
some new shit, huh? We been here though.

03:43.458 --> 03:45.666
We should rob him. Send a message.

03:45.750 --> 03:46.875
I am down for that.

03:47.541 --> 03:49.666
Why would weâ€¦ [grunts] No.

03:50.916 --> 03:51.916
I was testing you.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.291
Fucking stupid.

03:53.375 --> 03:54.375
You guys got next?

03:54.958 --> 03:58.291
Depend on who asking.
If you asking, yeah, we got next.

03:58.375 --> 04:00.458
And then after that it could be you

04:00.541 --> 04:03.500
and ol' boy who mama look like
she gave up on Black men.

04:04.416 --> 04:07.000
Well, I would never give up on you guys.

04:08.416 --> 04:09.666
Is that a colonic water?

04:10.750 --> 04:13.625
No, it's, um--
It's actually my 30-day detox program.

04:13.708 --> 04:15.000
You guys wanna try a free sample?

04:15.083 --> 04:17.750
Uh, nah,
I ain't drinking no boo-boo juice.

04:19.166 --> 04:20.208
All right, fellas.

04:23.041 --> 04:24.333
Just to send a message though.

04:24.416 --> 04:26.333
Mm-hmm. I'm thinking about it.

04:28.875 --> 04:31.500
-What the fuck is the point of the ball?
-Stretch out. Just fucking stretch.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
One.

04:36.083 --> 04:37.083
Two.

04:39.625 --> 04:40.833
Eyes up, eyes up.

04:42.416 --> 04:43.875
Finish, finish, finish.

04:45.166 --> 04:46.458
All right.

04:50.583 --> 04:52.166
How many subscribers you think you up to?

04:53.000 --> 04:55.041
I don't know. Thousand, give or take.

04:55.125 --> 04:57.208
[scoffs] Give or take what? A thousand?

04:57.291 --> 04:58.291
[chuckles]

04:59.750 --> 05:01.375
Ball.

05:02.541 --> 05:03.541
Ball.

05:04.166 --> 05:07.416
Hey, man, I-- I just noticed you're not
getting enough legs underneath your shot.

05:07.500 --> 05:08.500
Are you dehydrated?

05:08.583 --> 05:10.958
Because my detox program
could really take care of that for you.

05:11.041 --> 05:12.166
What the fuck?

05:12.791 --> 05:15.375
Bro, give me the ball back and stop using
that young Black kid for clout.

05:15.458 --> 05:16.583
Give me the fucking ball.

05:19.666 --> 05:21.875
You know, I just feel like you could use
some of the attention

05:21.958 --> 05:24.791
that your athleticism attracts
to get your teammates involved.

05:24.875 --> 05:27.958
Instead of taking these shots
that are a little out of your range.

05:31.833 --> 05:32.958
Out of my range?

05:34.083 --> 05:35.541
[friend] Come on, bro. Don't do this shit.

05:37.541 --> 05:38.625
Pick a spot, bro.

05:38.708 --> 05:41.583
Hundred bucks you can't make
more shots than me. Best out of five.

05:41.666 --> 05:45.833
Look, obvious that you're
an amazing pickup hoops guy, you know?

05:45.916 --> 05:47.291
I could tell you have a lot of passion.

05:47.375 --> 05:50.125
You got the tattoo of a basketball
with the crown on it. I get it.

05:50.958 --> 05:53.333
But let's not do this, man.
I don't want to take your money.

05:53.958 --> 05:55.250
200.

05:55.333 --> 05:56.541
Let's just do 300.

05:57.583 --> 05:59.333
[chuckles] It's not my dad's money.

06:00.375 --> 06:01.541
Just fuck me, huh?

06:04.375 --> 06:05.625
[influencer] Right there's good.

06:09.458 --> 06:10.458
[Kamal] That's one.

06:16.791 --> 06:17.791
Two.

06:20.458 --> 06:22.708
It's been my spot
since I was 14, gentrifier.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.375
Next time look at the wall. Yeah.

06:28.416 --> 06:29.458
That's three.

06:32.583 --> 06:35.416
Hold on, you're Kamal Allen.

06:36.500 --> 06:38.416
Didn't you get arrested your senior year?

06:39.791 --> 06:41.750
-[spectators clapping rhythmically]
-Overrated!

06:41.833 --> 06:43.833
-Hey, Kamal, you fucking suck!
-Overrated!

06:48.416 --> 06:49.458
Hey, come on, Kamal!

06:50.291 --> 06:52.166
[players gasp, murmur]

06:52.250 --> 06:54.250
Was that guy just a random fan?

06:55.708 --> 06:57.208
Now where'd you end up playing in college?

07:03.291 --> 07:05.166
[players murmur]

07:06.458 --> 07:08.625
[influencer] Three for five.
Not bad, my brother.

07:08.708 --> 07:11.500
Hope you can shoot, Sherman Oaks.

07:12.458 --> 07:15.333
I grew up in Beverly Hills actually.
Not the super nice part.

07:16.250 --> 07:19.166
Yeah, you know, sometimes I like
to practice shooting off the dribble

07:19.250 --> 07:23.291
'cause it's rare you can catch a shoot
with all these wannabe Hardens out here.

07:24.625 --> 07:26.625
-[players gasp]
-[influencer] One.

07:27.375 --> 07:29.458
You get it. You're a Harden.

07:30.041 --> 07:31.125
No offense.

07:33.708 --> 07:34.708
That's two.

07:34.791 --> 07:36.666
You thought I couldn't hang. I get it.

07:37.666 --> 07:38.791
But a shoot-out?

07:40.583 --> 07:43.125
-Three.
-[players laugh]

07:43.208 --> 07:45.958
I mean, don't you guys assume
all white dudes can do is shoot?

07:47.916 --> 07:48.916
[sighs]

07:49.000 --> 07:51.291
You know,
there's this old quote that says,

07:51.375 --> 07:54.541
"Under pressure,
you don't rise to the occasion.

07:55.208 --> 07:57.208
You sink to the level of your training."

07:58.708 --> 07:59.916
Andâ€¦

08:00.000 --> 08:01.125
that's four.

08:01.208 --> 08:02.333
[player] Wow.

08:03.583 --> 08:06.416
So, I prefer Venmo or Zelle,

08:06.500 --> 08:09.250
but you seem like a Cash App guy,
so that's fine.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.416
[friend] That was disappointing as fuck.

08:13.041 --> 08:15.333
We ain't never gonna get our reparations
that way, bruh.

08:19.916 --> 08:20.916
Yo!

08:21.833 --> 08:22.833
Hey, yo!

08:24.416 --> 08:25.416
You left yourâ€¦

08:27.083 --> 08:28.083
[sighs]

08:29.166 --> 08:30.500
Who the fuck is this guy?

08:31.916 --> 08:33.958
["Hollandaise" playing]

08:54.291 --> 08:56.958
[music continues]

09:04.500 --> 09:05.500
[music ends]

09:06.083 --> 09:08.666
[siren wailing in distance]

09:21.041 --> 09:23.125
[patron] This salon space is hella dope.

09:23.208 --> 09:25.500
I can for sure see you running shit there.

09:25.583 --> 09:27.208
[hair stylist] I know.

09:27.708 --> 09:30.666
And look, I'm not trying to be
rentin' a chair in somebody else's spot.

09:30.750 --> 09:31.750
-You know?
-Mm-mmm.

09:31.833 --> 09:34.916
[hair stylist] This spot right here
is so close I could literally walk to work

09:35.000 --> 09:37.416
without having to worry about
what gas prices looking like every week.

09:37.500 --> 09:38.666
-[patron] That's fire.
-Hey, babe.

09:38.750 --> 09:39.750
Hey.

09:41.750 --> 09:43.750
[clears throat] Can you-- Can you back up?

09:43.833 --> 09:45.833
My fault. The zookeepers let you out?

09:45.916 --> 09:47.416
-[imitates laughing] Shut up.
-Ba--

09:47.500 --> 09:48.958
-Daddy!
-Hey! Come up.

09:49.041 --> 09:51.250
[both groaning]

09:53.208 --> 09:54.416
Babe, what's this?

09:54.500 --> 09:56.750
-Oh, Edith got that for Drew's birthday.
-Mm-hmm.

09:56.833 --> 09:57.958
He's opening presents already?

09:58.041 --> 10:00.250
Present. I told him he could open one.

10:02.500 --> 10:04.458
Hey. You wanna go with Daddy
to get some ice cream?

10:04.541 --> 10:05.625
-Yeah!

10:05.708 --> 10:07.041
-[wife] Yeah, all right now.
-Yeah!

10:07.125 --> 10:09.958
When he come back and he up all night
from that sugar, he's gonna be with you.

10:10.041 --> 10:11.916
It'll be fine. Right?
Say, "Don't worry, Mommy."

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
-Don't worry, Mommy.

10:14.083 --> 10:15.750
-Oh, babe?
-Hmm?

10:15.833 --> 10:17.416
It's almost the 1st, by the way.

10:18.208 --> 10:20.625
Yep, mm-hmm. I'ma go tomorrow. I forgot.

10:20.708 --> 10:24.333
Mmm. Why don't you just go now
and get your pralines and cream after?

10:24.416 --> 10:27.041
Because everyone don't have a sugar daddy
like you and can go at anytime.

10:27.125 --> 10:28.458
First of all, I'm a PIMP.

10:28.541 --> 10:32.000
Second of all, bank is open till 6:00 on
Crenshaw so what are you talk--

10:32.541 --> 10:33.541
My bad.

10:33.625 --> 10:35.041
-I'ma go tomorrow. I promise.
-Okay.

10:35.125 --> 10:36.250
-[Kamal] Love you.
-Love you too.

10:36.333 --> 10:38.333
-[Kamal] Say, "Bye, Auntie Edith."
-[Drew] Bye, Auntie Edith.

10:38.416 --> 10:39.916
"I'm sorry you on welfare."

10:40.000 --> 10:41.416
-I'm sorry you on welfare.
-[Edith] Bye!

10:41.500 --> 10:43.666
-Why you so fucking nosy?
-I'm just trying to help.

10:43.750 --> 10:45.291
-Okay, okay.
-This is getting crazy with you.

10:47.583 --> 10:48.875
All right. See you later.

10:58.375 --> 10:59.375
Jeremy!

11:00.666 --> 11:01.916
Big Mooch.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.291
Hey, look, man.

11:03.375 --> 11:06.625
I hate to be this guy, but the boss
is on my head about membership fees.

11:07.125 --> 11:09.083
You know what's more important to a gym
than money?

11:09.625 --> 11:10.625
Watch this.

11:11.541 --> 11:13.250
Susie, you are getting so toned.

11:14.875 --> 11:15.875
Save it, Jeremy.

11:15.958 --> 11:17.333
You're too much for me, woman.

11:17.416 --> 11:19.125
[laughs]

11:19.208 --> 11:21.083
Every gym needs a morale guy.
You're welcome.

11:21.166 --> 11:23.041
You don't even know her old ass!

11:23.125 --> 11:25.416
I'm already breaking protocol
letting you train people up in here

11:25.500 --> 11:26.541
without renting out the court.

11:26.625 --> 11:28.958
[Jeremy] I got other spots, bro.
You act like I'm here all the time.

11:29.041 --> 11:31.791
You here four hours a day every day.
Just pay your dues.

11:31.875 --> 11:35.416
It's not right for you to be charging the
working class 34.99 plus initiation fees.

11:35.500 --> 11:36.541
Like, come on.

11:37.416 --> 11:40.083
Pay your fees or go to them other spots.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.375

-Here.

11:48.375 --> 11:51.208
Next month's due on Thursday too,
if you wanna take care of that.

11:51.791 --> 11:55.000
I live for today, Mooch.
Tomorrow's not promised to us poor folks.

11:55.083 --> 11:57.916
Hold on, what the hell you mean
"tomorrow's not promised"?

11:58.000 --> 11:59.958
What you got in that bag?

12:01.000 --> 12:03.125
See, that's why white folks
make me nervous.

12:03.208 --> 12:06.375
[Jeremy] You'll shed fat, gain muscle,
and detoxify your whole system

12:06.458 --> 12:08.708
all with the purchase of a 30-day supply.

12:08.791 --> 12:12.125
So what you gotta ask yourselves,
Mikey, Angel, Flaco,

12:12.208 --> 12:14.791
is do you wanna be the tortoise
or do you wanna be the hare?

12:14.875 --> 12:17.083
Goddamn, J!

12:17.166 --> 12:18.916
Looking good, my brother.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.458
Thanks, Teej. You know, my knee
hasn't felt this good since junior year.

12:21.541 --> 12:22.666
Fuck yeah, dude.

12:22.750 --> 12:24.791
What's up, "quesa-dildos," how ya doing?

12:24.875 --> 12:26.416
-Ah, the detox?
-Ah, you know.

12:41.416 --> 12:42.583
[TJ] You know, one of these days,

12:42.666 --> 12:44.875
you're gonna have to teach me
these breathing exercises, man.

12:44.958 --> 12:48.125
I think they really unlock
next-level mobility in your hips.

12:48.625 --> 12:50.291
Okay, you want the usual?

12:50.375 --> 12:53.125
'Cause I got Oxys. I got Percs, Xanis.

12:53.208 --> 12:54.416
I got some Klonopin.

12:54.500 --> 12:59.041
I got some Adderall, Ritalin. And I got
some good old-fashion booger-sugar.

12:59.125 --> 13:01.250
Yeah, I'll take the usual, please.
Just put it on my tab.

13:01.333 --> 13:02.458
Yeah, I got you, bro.

13:02.541 --> 13:04.083
Don't take too many of these. Okay?

13:04.166 --> 13:05.333
You take too many of those,

13:05.416 --> 13:08.375
you'll be on Hollywood Boulevard
doing TikTok dances without a cell phone.

13:09.958 --> 13:11.666
Also, I got some insider information
for you.

13:11.750 --> 13:13.791
Even though
I probably shouldn't be telling you this

13:13.875 --> 13:16.875
because you getting healthy
is kind of a conflict of interest for me,

13:16.958 --> 13:17.958
but you are my boy.

13:18.041 --> 13:19.166
Okay?

13:19.250 --> 13:20.333
Let's hear it.

13:22.125 --> 13:24.333
Stem cells.

13:25.708 --> 13:27.416
Two words. [clicks tongue]

13:28.125 --> 13:29.666
The two words are "stem cells"?

13:29.750 --> 13:32.041
Regenerative medicine, bro.

13:32.125 --> 13:34.916
Are you kidding me? You haven't heard of
this shit? It's gone totally mainstream.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.500
It's, like,
10 G's for a full treatment now.

13:36.583 --> 13:38.041
Rich people love this shit.

13:38.125 --> 13:41.000
Whoadie, listen.
It heals old injuries and new injuries,

13:41.083 --> 13:42.250
rejuvenates your whole body.

13:42.333 --> 13:43.875
It can heal old injuries?

13:43.958 --> 13:45.875
If you're serious
about getting your body in shape

13:45.958 --> 13:48.916
and making a push for the G League,
you need the stem cells, okay?

13:49.000 --> 13:50.250
It will cure your ACL for good.

13:50.333 --> 13:52.125
ACLs. Plural.

Dude, how do you think Tiger Woods
grew back his leg after they amputated it?

to agitate me today, bro?

20:41.333 --> 20:42.583

-What's up, bro. That's hard.
-Yeah. Yeah, it's good for business too.

21:09.416 --> 21:10.958
Just signed a lease on a Tesla.

21:11.041 --> 21:13.041
Got invited to The Hype House.

21:13.125 --> 21:15.875
My IG's been popping off, bro.

21:15.958 --> 21:18.416
I mean, I got a lot of haters
in the comment section,

21:18.500 --> 21:20.166
but I think it's mostly just white hoopers

21:20.250 --> 21:22.083
who hate to see another white hooper
find his lane.

21:22.166 --> 21:23.041
You feel me?

21:23.125 --> 21:24.791
We don't talk enough about that, bro.

21:24.875 --> 21:27.583
White on white crime, like,
that's just a disease, man.

21:27.666 --> 21:29.041
-Amen.
-[Phil] Yeah.

21:29.125 --> 21:30.250
You a trainer?

21:30.333 --> 21:32.291
-[scoffs] Hell nah.
-Play you for the court.

21:32.375 --> 21:35.458
Two-on-two.
Big dogs versus regular-sized dogs.

21:35.541 --> 21:38.000
[chuckles] Yo, you joking, right?

21:38.083 --> 21:39.791
["Who That Is" playing]

21:39.875 --> 21:41.125
You wanna put some money on it?

21:43.166 --> 21:44.166
All right.

21:53.458 --> 21:54.625
[Jacoby grunts] Come on. Jump.

21:55.458 --> 21:56.541
Hey, watch-- Pick, pick!

21:58.958 --> 22:00.333
Ball! Ball!

22:00.416 --> 22:02.333
[alarm beeping]

22:02.416 --> 22:03.416
Shit.

22:03.500 --> 22:05.125
[beeping continues]

22:06.333 --> 22:08.041
Two minutes, two minutes.
I'm coming right back.

22:08.125 --> 22:09.416
[Jacoby] What? Jeremy!

22:09.500 --> 22:11.208
-[beeping stops]
-Yo, where's he going?

22:15.458 --> 22:16.791
[machine] Parking validated.

22:23.166 --> 22:24.166
Shit.

22:24.250 --> 22:25.291
[music stops]

22:30.166 --> 22:31.750
Yo, what the fuck was that?

22:32.250 --> 22:33.333
It's fine. Check it up.

22:33.416 --> 22:35.500
[music continues]

22:35.583 --> 22:36.583
Come on.

22:37.625 --> 22:38.666
You know what to do.

22:51.375 --> 22:53.583
-[grunts, groans]
-[bone crunching]

22:53.666 --> 22:55.291
[music ends]

22:55.375 --> 22:56.416
Fuck!

23:01.541 --> 23:03.625
[Kamal] You just gonna let him
have the court like that?

23:03.708 --> 23:06.958
The fuck? I think I proved my point.

23:07.708 --> 23:09.083
-Do you?
-Yeah.

23:09.791 --> 23:10.791
How's the knee?

23:11.500 --> 23:12.583
Dude, what do you want?

23:14.458 --> 23:15.458
[sighs]

23:15.958 --> 23:16.958
You stalking me?

23:17.041 --> 23:18.541
[Kamal] It's called Google, bro.

23:18.625 --> 23:20.291
You think you fucking slick, huh?

23:20.375 --> 23:22.000
Showing up to courts
dressed like a dumbass,

23:22.083 --> 23:25.208
acting like you can't hoop when, really,
you played at Gonzaga.

23:25.291 --> 23:28.000
Now see, you assumed I couldn't hoop
because I'm white,

23:28.083 --> 23:30.416
-which is incredibly outdated, by the way.
-No, I assumed you couldn't hoop

23:30.500 --> 23:32.916
'cause you walk around
with testicles around your neck, bro.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.958
What up, J! Hey, man,
can we talk about that tab later?

23:36.041 --> 23:37.250
I got you next time, Teej.

23:37.333 --> 23:40.291
I know you do, twin.
All right, keep pushin' P.

23:46.833 --> 23:47.958
Look, bro, I came to see

23:48.041 --> 23:50.375
if you wanted to play in a two-on-two
this weekend at Venice Beach.

23:50.458 --> 23:53.583
We can hustle a few games together to get
the money for the entry fee, all right?

23:53.666 --> 23:55.375
You're joking, right?

23:55.458 --> 23:57.958
Dude, there's a million leagues
I can play in right now.

23:58.625 --> 24:00.208
Tons of opportunities to get scouted.

24:00.291 --> 24:01.583
I'm straight.

24:02.250 --> 24:04.000
You seriously
still trying to play pro ball?

24:05.375 --> 24:07.208
I mean, maybe not the G League butâ€¦

24:07.916 --> 24:08.916
Wow.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.750
[Jeremy] What?
What, you don't think I'm good enough?

24:10.833 --> 24:12.250
Nah, you just make so much more sense now.

24:12.333 --> 24:14.583
Yeah? You don't make any sense.

24:14.666 --> 24:16.791
No injuries. You're in good shape.

24:17.416 --> 24:18.875
Why are you still playing pickup?

24:18.958 --> 24:21.708
I'm not one of your poor little Black boys
looking for a father figure, all right?

24:21.791 --> 24:24.458
Don't need a coach, don't need a mentor,

24:24.541 --> 24:25.791
and I damn sure don't need a friend.

24:25.875 --> 24:28.958
What I need is for you to show up on time,
stand in a corner and hit some open shots.

24:29.041 --> 24:31.041
Maybe play a little bit of defense.
That's it.

24:31.125 --> 24:33.875
Wow. Lot to unpack there.

24:33.958 --> 24:36.500
[scoffs] I mean, fuck.
How can I say no to that?

24:40.791 --> 24:42.208
Bro. What?

24:43.125 --> 24:44.125
What the fuck?

24:44.208 --> 24:45.916
Who gives a parking ticket for backing in?

24:46.000 --> 24:47.041
Everyone backs in!

24:47.125 --> 24:49.458
I can't afford a fucking parking ticket
right now.

24:49.541 --> 24:52.958
Cash prize is 25,000 for one day of hoop.

24:54.291 --> 24:55.875
Look, bro, do you wanna play or what?

24:56.791 --> 24:58.125
25K.

25:01.416 --> 25:03.166
Look, we're gonna get in here
and hustle a few games

25:03.250 --> 25:05.250
and get our entry fee for the tournament.
Period.

25:05.916 --> 25:08.333
And no one's gonna think that
you can play dressed like that.

25:09.375 --> 25:12.375
I look like a modern hooper
with low body fat and functional strength.

25:12.458 --> 25:14.333
I'm basically a less-fat Luka,

25:14.416 --> 25:17.000
who's the best player in the league
by the way, and once people admit that,

25:17.083 --> 25:19.250
race relations in this country
might actually improve.

25:19.333 --> 25:21.541
I'm just saying we could really use it
to our advantage, all right?

25:21.625 --> 25:24.041
Get on the court. Rinse and repeat
until we get the entry fee.

25:24.125 --> 25:25.125
-How's the knee?
-Great.

25:25.208 --> 25:27.125
Hey, come on. [mutters]
Where the fuck you going?

25:27.208 --> 25:30.125
I mean, am I still the do-it-all playmaker
with elite athleticism?

25:30.208 --> 25:32.250
Not quite,
but I'm getting some bounce back.

25:32.333 --> 25:35.083
Plus I'm just way better now 'cause of
how my injuries have made me evolve.

25:35.166 --> 25:37.083
Game's easier now. It's way slower.

25:37.166 --> 25:40.583
I just play the angles and let the ball
pretty much come to me wherever I am.

25:41.958 --> 25:43.208
Okay.

25:43.291 --> 25:44.291
What?

25:44.375 --> 25:46.250
[scoffs] Nothing, man.

25:46.333 --> 25:48.333
[whimsical music playing]

25:52.833 --> 25:54.833
[player 1] Offense, offense. Right here.

25:58.291 --> 25:59.291
[player 2] To the wing!

26:00.000 --> 26:02.250
This won't work here.
There's too many white guys.

26:02.333 --> 26:04.541
We need to go back to the Eastside
where they won't see you coming.

26:05.375 --> 26:06.791
The race shit is dated, bro.

26:06.875 --> 26:08.750
Everybody but you
knows white dudes can hoop now.

26:09.333 --> 26:12.125
I'll find some marks, get in their heads,
throw 'em off their game,

26:12.208 --> 26:13.291
and we'll clean up.

26:14.291 --> 26:16.333
I'm great at spotting mental weakness
in hoopers, bro.

26:16.416 --> 26:19.416
I'm like the P.T. Anderson
of basketball psychological warfare.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.833
Who the fuck is P.T. Anderson?

26:23.208 --> 26:24.791
Our greatest living director.

26:25.416 --> 26:27.500
Spike Lee is our greatest living director.

26:27.583 --> 26:29.625
Spike Lee's not even a good Knicks fan.

26:30.125 --> 26:31.875
I knew this was a mistake.

26:31.958 --> 26:34.416
Look, man. You're the one who said
you don't even wanna make friends.

26:34.500 --> 26:36.250
-I don't.
-Let's just make our money.

26:36.833 --> 26:39.083
I guarantee you I can get everyone
out here to bet on themselves.

26:39.166 --> 26:40.458
I got you to put up 300.

26:43.416 --> 26:44.666
[music fades]

26:44.750 --> 26:46.625
-[player 1] Oh!
-[player 2] Okay!

26:46.708 --> 26:47.958
-[player 3] All right!
-[Kamal sighs]

26:48.041 --> 26:50.750
Hey, bro. We got this.

26:52.666 --> 26:53.708
[mouthing] Fuck.

26:55.916 --> 26:57.916
You might wanna shoot
a little closer to the rim.

26:58.000 --> 26:59.458
I feel like you're out of your range.

27:05.291 --> 27:06.333
Told you, man.

27:08.875 --> 27:10.875
Let's put some money on it.
Make it interesting.

27:11.833 --> 27:13.916
One-on-one. First to 11.

27:14.500 --> 27:15.708
You gonna wear that trash bag?

27:15.791 --> 27:18.000
You gonna wear that fake-ass
Richard Simmons outfit?

27:18.083 --> 27:19.458
Let's put 200 on it.

27:25.166 --> 27:26.583
Okay. Fine.

27:27.166 --> 27:30.125
But only because I have a soft spot
for thick-ass ballers like you.

27:30.208 --> 27:32.041
-Who the fuck--
-[Jeremy] Mike Sweetney.

27:32.125 --> 27:33.958
Tractor Traylor. Escalade.

27:34.041 --> 27:36.833
Guys like you were the neck bone
of the league for so long.

27:36.916 --> 27:38.875
[player] Two-on-two and make it 300.

27:44.083 --> 27:45.083
Huh.

27:46.458 --> 27:47.625
Excuse me one second.

27:49.541 --> 27:52.541
See what the fuck he got on?
That's the shit I don't like, bro.

27:53.500 --> 27:55.833
Okay. We've got a problem.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.500
The guy just picked up an Antetokounmpo.

28:00.375 --> 28:02.958
I don't like this at all.
What if they're trying to hustle us?

28:03.458 --> 28:04.708
You got your money?

28:05.416 --> 28:07.083
Nigga, I got nine kids.

28:07.166 --> 28:08.375
Black people come from a long line

28:08.458 --> 28:09.958
-of kings and queens, all right?
-True.

28:10.041 --> 28:12.041
Had to fight for every right
since we been in this country.

28:12.125 --> 28:14.500
-I always say that. Yeah.
-Thank you. It's confidence.

28:14.583 --> 28:17.250
Why would they be afraid of you walking
around looking like a Sierra Mist can?

28:17.333 --> 28:18.833
-True.
-Let's whoop 'em.

28:19.916 --> 28:20.916
You are a king.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.333
All right. You wanna work, huh?
You wanna work, huh?

28:24.333 --> 28:25.333
You wanna work, huh?

28:25.416 --> 28:27.083
Oh! [shouts]

28:30.708 --> 28:32.125
-[Kamal] Ball. Ball.
-[groans, grunts]

28:32.208 --> 28:33.291
[player 2] Look at us.

28:33.833 --> 28:35.125
-What are you doing?
-Relax.

28:35.208 --> 28:36.583
[player 2] Whoo-hoo! Yes!

28:40.666 --> 28:41.666
The fuck is that?

28:41.750 --> 28:42.750
[Jeremy] My bad.

28:42.833 --> 28:45.583
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Oh, I get it.

28:45.666 --> 28:48.166
Y'all got like a jungle fever type
connection, huh?

28:48.250 --> 28:49.583
Nasty-ass nigga.

28:52.000 --> 28:53.541
What you looking at, boy?

28:53.625 --> 28:54.666
Easy!

28:54.750 --> 28:56.083
Stop being lazy on D, bro.

28:56.166 --> 28:58.500
Fuck you say? Being lazy?
What, you my overseer now?

28:59.458 --> 29:02.250
I just said a thing that's true.
Everything isn't racist, bro.

29:02.333 --> 29:04.375
You acting like I said,
"Quit being angry, Black fellow."

29:04.458 --> 29:06.041
But you wanted to say that shit,
didn't you?

29:06.125 --> 29:07.333
I'm not one of those people, bro.

29:07.416 --> 29:08.416
One of what people, Jeremy?

29:08.500 --> 29:09.583
People who say stuff like that.

29:09.666 --> 29:10.791
Say stuff like what?

29:10.875 --> 29:13.916
Like, "Oh my, God, Kamal, you're so
well-spoken." Which you are, by the way.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.083
See, you wanted to say that shit
right now, didn't you?

29:16.166 --> 29:18.166
-You have a nice flow, like Obama.
-Man, just stop.

29:19.416 --> 29:21.916
Look, I'm just saying
you don't scream thuggish

29:22.000 --> 29:23.375
even though you're chocolate chocolate.

29:23.458 --> 29:24.916
The fuck is chocolate chocolate?

29:25.000 --> 29:27.083
Well, a lot of Black people these days
are milk chocolate.

29:27.166 --> 29:29.958
And I think it's because interracial
relationships were illegal till the '60s.

29:30.041 --> 29:31.333
It was a fucking rhetorical question.

29:31.416 --> 29:33.250
And you know what?
I'm done with that racist shit.

29:33.333 --> 29:35.250
-Same. No more race.
-Fine.

29:35.333 --> 29:36.333
-Great.

29:36.416 --> 29:38.416
Hey, yo! What the fuck is going on?

29:39.458 --> 29:41.875
[Jeremy] Can you not see
we're having a fucking conversation?

29:45.791 --> 29:46.916
[both grunt]

29:47.000 --> 29:48.166
[Kamal] And one!

29:48.250 --> 29:49.708
Ain't nobody foul you.

29:49.791 --> 29:50.916
You're a hack, bro.

29:52.458 --> 29:53.583
Shoot for it.

29:53.666 --> 29:55.833
-You make it, you get the call.
-[chuckles] Say less.

29:57.500 --> 29:59.000
[player] Nobody fuckin' fouled him.

30:00.291 --> 30:01.916
I probably should've asked this earlier,

30:02.000 --> 30:03.708
but how much cash do you have on you?

30:04.666 --> 30:06.625
Did you not bring enough money
to cover this game?

30:08.041 --> 30:09.375
I brought, like, 80â€¦

30:10.291 --> 30:11.291
minus 60.

30:12.916 --> 30:16.250
[Kamal] So you brought $20
to cover a $300 bet?

30:17.291 --> 30:18.625
[player] He's trying to cheat 'causeâ€¦

30:18.708 --> 30:20.416
When you say it out loud,
it's pretty fucked.

30:20.500 --> 30:21.500
â€¦I had my hand up.

30:21.583 --> 30:24.291
[Kamal] Why don't you just Venmo them
the money that you finessed me for?

30:24.375 --> 30:27.666
-I burned through that days ago.
-[player] It was a shit call. That's it.

30:28.458 --> 30:31.041
They're not just gonna accept $20
on a $300 bet.

30:32.500 --> 30:34.416
Then they better not win, right?

30:40.625 --> 30:42.125
We could really use some rain, huh?

30:46.000 --> 30:47.083
[sighs]

30:49.208 --> 30:50.208
[Kamal] Check up.

30:50.291 --> 30:51.500
Yeah, check up.

30:52.000 --> 30:53.625
["Whoomp! (There It Is)" playing]

30:53.708 --> 30:55.083
[Kamal shouts]

30:55.166 --> 30:56.750
-Fuck!
-[Kamal] There it is!

31:02.916 --> 31:03.875
Game point, baby.

31:05.000 --> 31:06.666
-I'll screen back.
-Switch, switch, switch!

31:07.166 --> 31:08.916
-Oh, yeah.
-Oh, yeah, I'm here.

31:09.791 --> 31:11.125
[Kamal] Mismatch! You got that mismatch.

31:11.208 --> 31:12.625
-Go ahead.
-[player grunts]

31:12.708 --> 31:14.583
Yes, sir! Bucket!

31:14.666 --> 31:15.875
Fuck, man!

31:19.000 --> 31:21.083
[grunts] Yeah, boy. Fucking go.

31:21.166 --> 31:23.500
Boy, look, I don't know how much
you talking shit played into that,

31:23.583 --> 31:25.250
-but good fucking work.
-Thank you.

31:25.333 --> 31:27.875
By the way, bro,
you could talk way more shit out there.

31:27.958 --> 31:29.875
You have so much material
I can't even touch.

31:30.666 --> 31:31.666
Like what?

31:34.916 --> 31:36.333
-Never mind.
-No.

31:36.958 --> 31:37.958
Tell us.

31:38.541 --> 31:40.250
What other Black jokes
you want to say, Jeremy?

31:40.750 --> 31:42.458
-Fuck you say, white boy?
-[spectator] What he say?

31:42.541 --> 31:45.458
You're telling me your friend here
doesn't look exactly like Malcolm X?

31:45.541 --> 31:48.083
[onlookers groaning, laughing]

31:49.541 --> 31:51.541
Hey, yo. Shut the fuck up and play ball.

31:51.625 --> 31:53.375
I'm gonna clamp that ass up.
Let's go. Come on.

31:53.458 --> 31:54.458
It's all love, dude.

31:54.541 --> 31:57.041
[music continues]

31:58.500 --> 31:59.750
Ball!

32:01.375 --> 32:02.916
And you better bust his ass.

32:07.708 --> 32:09.208
[onlookers shouting, cheering]

32:09.291 --> 32:11.708
[spectator 2]
Yeah, yeah, yeah! Whoo-hoo! All right!

32:13.166 --> 32:14.166
Fuck!

32:20.833 --> 32:22.041
[player] What you doin' now?

32:22.125 --> 32:23.416
This ain't your court.

32:23.500 --> 32:25.375
-It don't work like that, man.
-Hey, fellas.

32:25.458 --> 32:26.875
Why don't y'all just fuck already?

32:26.958 --> 32:29.375
-You're too easy. Hey, it's too easy, dog.
-Quit playing with me. What?

32:29.458 --> 32:30.666
They would look good together, huh?

32:30.750 --> 32:32.041
-Shut the fuck up, man.
-[Kamal] Ball.

32:34.125 --> 32:35.791
[Jeremy] Switch, switch, switch,
switch, switch.

32:35.875 --> 32:36.875
Hey, white boy. What's up?

32:36.958 --> 32:38.708
Nah, you're mine so go on and pass.
Just pass it.

32:38.791 --> 32:40.666
-[player] Watch out. Watch out.
-[Kamal grunts]

32:41.291 --> 32:44.458
Man, get your pussy ass up!
I ain't even hit you that hard.

32:44.541 --> 32:46.625
-That's what we doing now?
-Yeah, that's how we gonna play.

32:47.250 --> 32:48.541
Yo, just let it go, 'Mal.

32:48.625 --> 32:50.458
-[player] Yeah, let it go.
-Let it go. Let it go.

32:50.541 --> 32:51.625
Man, he ain't finna do shit--

32:51.708 --> 32:52.708
[grunts]

32:52.791 --> 32:54.083
-Jesus Christ, bro.
-What now, bitch?

32:54.166 --> 32:55.625
[player groans]

32:55.708 --> 32:57.000
What, you want some too?

32:57.083 --> 32:58.541
-Okay, don't look nowâ€¦
-Huh?

32:58.625 --> 32:59.916
-â€¦but he has friends coming.
-Uh-uh.

33:00.000 --> 33:01.791
-Fuck his friends.
-[onlooker] I'm outta here.

33:01.875 --> 33:04.041
-Come on, girl. He got a flamethrower.
-Flamethrower?

33:04.125 --> 33:05.458
Yeah, bitch, flamethrower.

33:06.083 --> 33:07.458
What is this? Mad Max?

33:07.541 --> 33:09.750
-[onlookers clamoring]
-[spectator] Aw, hell nah.

33:09.833 --> 33:11.375
-[Kamal] Yo, yo.
-[Jeremy] Yo!

33:11.958 --> 33:14.333
-Damn. Oh, shit. Whoa!
-[onlookers shouting]

33:15.833 --> 33:17.458
What about my car? What about my car?

33:25.375 --> 33:26.958
[tires squeal]

33:33.041 --> 33:33.958
Whoo-hoo!

33:35.250 --> 33:36.250
[driver] Fuck!

33:37.125 --> 33:38.666
Get the fuck out the way!

33:39.166 --> 33:40.583
[brakes squealing]

33:40.666 --> 33:42.416
-[horn honking]
-Come on. Get in. Get in!

33:43.583 --> 33:45.166
Come on!
Drive, drive, drive, drive, drive!

33:45.250 --> 33:46.500
Yo, where the fuck you going, man?

33:47.666 --> 33:49.833
Come on, man. Come on, come on.
Stop fucking around!

33:51.000 --> 33:52.583
Just fucking drive. Come on, come on.

33:54.208 --> 33:55.750
-Come on, come on, come on.
-[Jeremy grunts]

33:55.833 --> 33:57.541
-You're fucking crazy, bro.
-[horn honking]

33:57.625 --> 33:59.625
[shouting]

33:59.708 --> 34:00.916
[music ends]

34:03.083 --> 34:05.791
[Jeremy] Now, that was the craziest shit
I've ever been through.

34:05.875 --> 34:07.291
-Here, man.
-Thanks, bro.

34:08.208 --> 34:09.291
So, where's your girl?

34:09.916 --> 34:11.333
At work. I gotta go pick her up soon.

34:11.416 --> 34:12.708
That's what's up.

34:14.333 --> 34:15.333
Here. Take this.

34:17.416 --> 34:20.333
All you eat is lettuce,
but then you pop pills?

34:20.416 --> 34:22.416
Life's too short to be in pain
when you don't have to.

34:23.208 --> 34:25.041
You're a complicated dude, bro.

34:25.625 --> 34:26.625
You ever tried therapy?

34:29.333 --> 34:31.916
What, like physical therapy?
That shit takes forever.

34:32.000 --> 34:33.000
No, like, therapy therapy.

34:33.083 --> 34:35.583
Where you sit and talk with a professional
about whatever's on your mind.

34:37.166 --> 34:39.583
Man, I got a barber I've been going to
for, like, 12 years.

34:39.666 --> 34:40.500
Mmm.

34:40.583 --> 34:43.458
Name is Arnold, I pay him 35 bucks,
he gives me a fresh fade,

34:43.541 --> 34:47.291
and I sit and I talk to someone
who actually knows me.

34:48.083 --> 34:50.583
Wow. I wish my therapist
would give me a fresh fade.

34:50.666 --> 34:52.791
That's a beautiful Black experience.

34:52.875 --> 34:55.958
I just think you should try something.
Try meditation.

34:56.041 --> 34:58.916
No offense,
but meditation is for white folks.

34:59.000 --> 35:03.166
None taken, but meditation isn't gonna
turn your skin white, you know?

35:03.250 --> 35:06.416
It's just gonna help you calm yourself
down whenever you're about to lose it.

35:07.041 --> 35:10.083
Oh, you talk more shit than anybody else
I've ever met on the court.

35:10.166 --> 35:11.500
What are you talking about?

35:11.583 --> 35:14.708
Yeah, but only to assholes
or for, like, strategy.

35:14.791 --> 35:17.541
I don't ever get angry.
I never get violent.

35:18.041 --> 35:19.291
Fuck that noise, bro.

35:23.166 --> 35:25.666
Yo, is this you? [chuckles]

35:26.958 --> 35:28.708
Oh, hold up, bro, is this--
Is that this place?

35:28.791 --> 35:31.041
Yeah, I live in the same two bedroom
I grew up in.

35:31.125 --> 35:32.125
With your parents?

35:32.208 --> 35:35.375
[Jeremy] They moved to Vegas to blow
their retirement on slot machines.

35:35.458 --> 35:36.458
I figured I'd keep the place

35:36.541 --> 35:39.625
'cause rent's low-key affordable
since they lived here for so long.

35:40.791 --> 35:42.958
Now, I'm about to whip you up
something real special.

35:43.041 --> 35:44.041
You want a smoothie?

35:45.333 --> 35:46.333
Uhâ€¦

35:47.125 --> 35:48.291
Nah, I'm good.

35:50.333 --> 35:52.250
You did pretty good out there today.

35:53.750 --> 35:57.833
Another full day of hustling,
and we'll have that 2,500 easy.

35:57.916 --> 35:58.916
[Jeremy] Sick.

35:59.750 --> 36:01.750
Yeah, my body's feeling better
than it has in a while.

36:01.833 --> 36:03.791
I'm actually excited
to play in this tournament.

36:04.375 --> 36:08.291
I'm gonna take my half of that 25K prize
and fix my body for real,

36:08.375 --> 36:11.791
so I can take a real shot at the G League,
maybe even the big show.

36:11.875 --> 36:13.958
I'm looking into
this regenerative medicine.

36:14.708 --> 36:16.041
This stuff called stem cells.

36:16.125 --> 36:17.541
It's supposed to be a game changer.

36:17.625 --> 36:18.625
So you wanna make more money

36:18.708 --> 36:20.541
to fix your broken body
so you can still play ball,

36:20.625 --> 36:22.833
which is what broke your body
in the first place?

36:22.916 --> 36:23.916
Yep.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.541
[chuckles] Basketball's a curse, bro.

36:26.625 --> 36:28.583
You love basketball.
If I remember correctly,

36:28.666 --> 36:30.666
I met you playing pickup
without a gun to your head.

36:31.250 --> 36:32.250
[Jeremy scoffs]

36:33.666 --> 36:36.791
Look, when I was in high school,
my pops took out this crazy loan

36:36.875 --> 36:37.958
and bought me an Escalade

36:38.041 --> 36:40.083
just 'cause he thought
I was going to make it to the league.

36:40.666 --> 36:41.875
Now I'm a nobody.

36:42.458 --> 36:44.291
And that Escalade
needs a new transmission.

36:45.625 --> 36:47.125
[Jeremy] Everybody's a nobody, bro.

36:47.208 --> 36:49.458
It doesn't matter how much money you have,
we're all the same.

36:49.541 --> 36:50.541
[Kamal] Hmm.

36:50.625 --> 36:53.375
[Jeremy] I grew up just as broke as you.
I just don't let it define me.

36:53.458 --> 36:56.458
That's 'cause you have the privilege of
being defined by never needing a haircut.

36:56.541 --> 36:58.208
Tatiana cut my hair last week.

37:00.208 --> 37:01.291
Yeah, it shows.

37:01.375 --> 37:04.083
Why are Black guys so obsessed
with haircuts?

37:04.166 --> 37:06.125
Why do white guys not give a fuck
about 'em?

37:06.208 --> 37:07.666
[Jeremy]
Thought we said no more race, bro.

37:07.750 --> 37:08.833
No more race, bro.

37:10.666 --> 37:12.083
[sighs]

37:12.166 --> 37:14.125
[lively music playing on speaker]

37:16.125 --> 37:17.208
It's a banger, right?

37:18.375 --> 37:19.625
What?

37:19.708 --> 37:20.833
It's cool.

37:20.916 --> 37:22.875
-I saw you tapping your foot.
-No, you didn't.

37:22.958 --> 37:25.083
Bro, you were literally just
tapping your foot to the beat.

37:25.166 --> 37:26.208
But I wasn't, though.

37:26.708 --> 37:28.458
-Oh, okay. So you don't like this?
-No.

37:28.541 --> 37:30.333
Okay, do you like any white artists?

37:30.416 --> 37:32.041
[sighs] I don't know.

37:32.125 --> 37:36.208
That one redhead dude
who also has trash-ass haircuts.

37:36.291 --> 37:38.250
-Ed Sheeran?
-Yeah. Him.

37:38.333 --> 37:39.500
I fuck with him.

37:40.125 --> 37:41.375
[Jeremy] All right, so imagine this.

37:41.458 --> 37:44.125
You're in your Escalade,
riding down Slauson, windows down,

37:44.625 --> 37:46.041
vibing to some fucking Ed.

37:46.625 --> 37:50.375
You pull up to a light, you look over,
it's a car full of fellow Black men.

37:50.458 --> 37:53.708
You either A, turn that shit down
as quick as you can,

37:53.791 --> 37:57.458
or B, keep singing
those timeless classics.

37:57.541 --> 37:58.583
Hey, 'Mal, guess what?

37:58.666 --> 37:59.666
What?

38:01.125 --> 38:02.125
I love the shape of you.

38:02.208 --> 38:04.083
What-- Get the fuck outta here.

38:04.166 --> 38:05.166
-Shit.
-I do.

38:05.750 --> 38:07.416
[Kamal scoffs] Here.

38:07.500 --> 38:08.958
Thanks for the heating pad, man.

38:09.541 --> 38:11.041
Hey, no problem.

38:11.125 --> 38:13.541
Just, uh, don't baby the hand.
You'll be good in a few days.

38:13.625 --> 38:14.625
Hey, look,

38:15.958 --> 38:17.708
my son's having a birthday party
this Saturday.

38:17.791 --> 38:19.375
-You should roll through.
-[scoffs]

38:20.083 --> 38:21.125
That's so fire.

38:21.875 --> 38:22.875
I fuck with kids.

38:25.416 --> 38:26.916
-Yeah, maybe don't say it like that.
-Nah,

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
I'm saying, like, kids are a vibe,
they're chill.

38:29.083 --> 38:32.416
Got you. And look, bring Tatiana too.
All right? So she can meet Imani.

38:33.291 --> 38:35.333
[Jeremy] She'll love that.
Just, uh, do me a favor.

38:36.041 --> 38:38.791
Don't bring up the hooping
or the stem cells.

38:38.875 --> 38:40.791
Definitely don't mention
the gambling. Please.

38:40.875 --> 38:43.583
I kind of told Tatiana
I'm done with all that stuff.

38:43.666 --> 38:44.916
Sounds like a healthy relationship.

38:45.000 --> 38:46.125
It is.

38:46.208 --> 38:49.458
Okay. Hey, don't spend any of the money
until we can cover the fee, all right?

38:49.541 --> 38:50.625
I should be saying that to you.

38:50.708 --> 38:52.166
-Boy, I'm good with money.
-So am I.

38:52.250 --> 38:53.375
-So am I.
-Me too.

38:53.458 --> 38:54.583
-Me too.
-Word.

38:54.666 --> 38:55.666
Word, bro.

38:56.333 --> 38:57.416
[chuckles]

38:57.500 --> 38:58.500
Clean up, man.

38:59.375 --> 39:01.625
[people chattering]

39:04.708 --> 39:08.041
[person] Hey, hey. What's up, girl?
Come on. What you got?

39:09.458 --> 39:11.458
[children scream, giggle]

39:12.333 --> 39:13.333
Come here.

39:15.208 --> 39:17.291
-Do me a favor, all right?
-Hmm?

39:17.375 --> 39:20.208
Take this 10, give it to your grandma.
Tell her I need an eighth.

39:20.291 --> 39:21.333
-Okay.
-Okay?

39:21.416 --> 39:22.750
-Okay.
-Don't short her.

39:25.333 --> 39:26.625
-Where the doobie?
-It's on the way.

39:26.708 --> 39:27.791
-Ooh!
-Yes, man.

39:29.250 --> 39:30.375
Drew, slow down.

39:30.458 --> 39:31.583
Don't worry, I got him.

39:31.666 --> 39:32.666
Thank you.

39:32.750 --> 39:34.458
-Hmm.
-Yeah, you still ugly.

39:35.041 --> 39:36.208
Yo, where you been?

39:36.708 --> 39:38.916
I've literally been setting up by myself
this whole time.

39:39.708 --> 39:41.708
-[clears throat]
-No, you don't get to bring Sprinkles

39:41.791 --> 39:43.583
and think shit is all good.
It's not giving that.

39:43.666 --> 39:44.833
-No?
-No.

39:47.041 --> 39:48.291
Oatmeal chocolate chip.

39:49.416 --> 39:50.500
For the queen.

39:52.000 --> 39:53.250
-Damn cookie.
-Mmm.

39:54.791 --> 39:56.833
Does this cookie mean
you made it to the bank?

39:56.916 --> 39:58.916
We're coming up on a week late now, babe.

39:59.000 --> 40:00.208
Already done.

40:00.291 --> 40:01.291
How?

40:02.541 --> 40:03.958
Just playing some ball again.

40:05.125 --> 40:06.291
-Okay.
-Yeah.

40:06.875 --> 40:09.166
I know that's not the parole officer
coming to the function.

40:09.250 --> 40:11.916
[friend] With a little caramel queen too?
The gall.

40:13.458 --> 40:14.541
Tatiana's Black?

40:15.666 --> 40:17.500
The Bon Iver concert canceled, homey.

40:17.583 --> 40:19.916
Is that why you're not selling
water bottles at SoFi?

40:20.708 --> 40:22.541
You gonna let him talk about you
like that, Black man?

40:22.625 --> 40:23.833
[Speedy] That's essential work.

40:25.708 --> 40:27.541
Hello. How are you?

40:27.625 --> 40:29.000
[Lorenzo giggles]

40:30.000 --> 40:31.333
Don't worry about that. Lorenzo.

40:31.416 --> 40:32.583
Hi.

40:32.666 --> 40:34.208
[Lorenzo] Look at yourself.
Look at yourself.

40:34.291 --> 40:35.916
Man, sit your ass down, bro.

40:36.000 --> 40:37.166
Hey, man.

40:37.250 --> 40:39.083
How you doing? I'm Kamal.

40:39.166 --> 40:40.875
-Hi.
-Nice to finally meet you.

40:40.958 --> 40:43.250
It's nice to meet you too. Jeremy says
you're on his detox program?

40:44.041 --> 40:46.083
Ri-- Yeah, no. Umâ€¦

40:46.166 --> 40:51.500
Yes. With the parsley and the-- and my gas
is better now, and I'm shitting right.

40:51.583 --> 40:52.750
Like, it'sâ€¦

40:52.833 --> 40:55.791
Hey. You must be Tatiana and Jeremy.

40:55.875 --> 40:58.458
-I'm Imani. Kamal's wife.
-So nice to meet you.

40:58.541 --> 41:00.541
-Thanks for having us.
-Yeah, no problem.

41:01.625 --> 41:02.708
-Hennessy.
-Oh, yeah.

41:03.666 --> 41:07.500
You-- Yeah. It's-It's one of
my favorite cognacs. You know, soâ€¦

41:07.583 --> 41:08.958
People have no idea how much care

41:09.041 --> 41:11.041
goes into making this
such a smooth and warm blend.

41:11.708 --> 41:14.125
Seriously. And they've been doing it
since 1765.

41:14.750 --> 41:16.166
Feel like it's slept on.

41:16.750 --> 41:19.458
-Oh. Okay.
-[Kamal] Hmm.

41:19.541 --> 41:21.791
Auntie, uh,
can you turn for us so we can jump rope?

41:21.875 --> 41:23.916
-Yeah, boo. I'll be right there.
-All right. Thank you.

41:24.000 --> 41:25.750
-Can I help?
-Yeah, come on.

41:25.833 --> 41:27.666
Let me know if you guys need any backup.

41:27.750 --> 41:29.458
-Boy, get out of here.
-Fine.

41:30.250 --> 41:31.583
Now I'm a part of your lies?

41:32.750 --> 41:33.750
[scoffs]

41:35.416 --> 41:36.833
-[person] What's up, white boy?
-Wow.

41:40.416 --> 41:42.500
You would never eat that
if you were on my cleanse.

41:43.458 --> 41:44.458
Yeah, you right.

41:48.000 --> 41:49.375
[sucks teeth] Mmm.

41:49.958 --> 41:52.375
How come everybody
always buys my son basketball stuff?

41:53.416 --> 41:56.625
I don't know, maybe because his dad
is kind of a well-known basketball player.

41:56.708 --> 41:58.208
[chuckles] Yeah. Was.

41:59.416 --> 42:02.416
[partygoers laughing]

42:05.083 --> 42:06.083
[Jeremy] Who's that?

42:07.208 --> 42:08.291
My pops.

42:08.375 --> 42:09.458
Oh, shit.

42:10.791 --> 42:12.625
-[sighs]
-[Lorenzo] Ah!

42:12.708 --> 42:14.458
-Oh, no. He crazy for that.
-MS.

42:14.541 --> 42:17.125
He got diagnosed
when I was in high school.

42:17.208 --> 42:20.208
The night I got arrested?
He was in the hospital.

42:20.791 --> 42:21.875
Sorry to hear that.

42:21.958 --> 42:22.958
[Kamal] It's cool.

42:23.458 --> 42:24.625
It is what it is.

42:24.708 --> 42:26.916
[laughing]

42:27.541 --> 42:29.041
The extra pickup money really helped.

42:29.708 --> 42:32.208
My girl started doing hair in our crib
to make ends meet.

42:32.875 --> 42:34.666
Now she doesn't wanna go back
to working at a salon.

42:34.750 --> 42:35.750
So I been raising money

42:35.833 --> 42:40.083
so I can get her and her bougie-ass
friends out my fucking living room.

42:41.375 --> 42:42.375
I feel you.

42:42.458 --> 42:44.958
My girl's a crazy talented
choreographer who--

42:45.041 --> 42:48.208
who's wasting her time
teaching classes at a dance studio

42:48.291 --> 42:50.250
because my income's so shaky right now.

42:52.041 --> 42:54.500
[laughs] What up, Pop?

42:54.583 --> 42:55.791
How you doing, son?

42:56.958 --> 42:58.708
Gonzaga basketball, right?

42:58.791 --> 42:59.916
How'd you know?

43:00.000 --> 43:03.166
I watch all the good ones.
You had a nice touch.

43:03.250 --> 43:04.250
Thank you, sir.

43:04.875 --> 43:07.458
[scoffs] Oh, man,
this dude is already cocky enough.

43:09.333 --> 43:12.333
Got to have some confidence to bring
a bottle of Henny to a Black function.

43:13.541 --> 43:15.041
It's all I drink, honestly.

43:15.125 --> 43:17.458
[Kamal's father]
It's funny you two being friends.

43:17.541 --> 43:20.000
I bet y'all got more in common
than meets the eye.

43:20.083 --> 43:21.833
-That's debatable.
-I doubt that.

43:23.958 --> 43:26.708
Like I said, a lot in common.

43:27.625 --> 43:28.791
You want something to drink?

43:29.500 --> 43:31.000
Yeah, give me some of that Henny.

43:32.041 --> 43:33.666
-I can drive the boat for you, sir.
-No.

43:33.750 --> 43:35.541
[laughs]
See this a good friend you got here.

43:35.625 --> 43:36.458
Nah.

43:41.208 --> 43:43.208
I had no idea about Kamal's pops.

43:44.166 --> 43:47.208
Dude was like the star of the show when
Kamal was the best player in the country.

43:48.041 --> 43:49.125
Life is crazy.

43:51.375 --> 43:53.250
-What happened?
-[Tatiana] Um...

43:53.333 --> 43:59.125
The studio got me a meeting with SZA to
go on tour as her assistant choreographer.

43:59.208 --> 44:00.375
Babe, that's amazing.

44:00.458 --> 44:02.833
[stammers] It's just a meeting.
I don't know. [sighs]

44:02.916 --> 44:05.375
Yeah, but it's a compliment that
they put you up there for that.

44:05.458 --> 44:08.166
-[stammers]
-She obviously sees how special you are.

44:09.250 --> 44:10.833
The money's not great,

44:10.916 --> 44:12.666
but my job would still be here
when I get back.

44:12.750 --> 44:13.750
Another win.

44:13.833 --> 44:17.541
It-- It's like significantly less,
actually. Umâ€¦

44:17.625 --> 44:19.208
Babe, take the win.

44:19.708 --> 44:20.875
I don't know.

44:20.958 --> 44:22.125
Take the win.

44:22.916 --> 44:26.416
Listen, if you want to make this happen,
we're gonna make this happen.

44:27.041 --> 44:28.208
How?

44:28.291 --> 44:30.791
Well, I don't wanna jinx it,

44:30.875 --> 44:35.000
but I kind of have an opportunity
of my own to make us some extra bread.

44:35.500 --> 44:37.083
Like a lot, actually.

44:37.166 --> 44:38.625
Like doing what?

44:39.291 --> 44:41.916
Just some private workouts
with some high-end guys.

44:42.000 --> 44:44.416
It's not a big deal,
but I could make like ten grand.

44:44.916 --> 44:46.458
-What?
-Yeah.

44:46.541 --> 44:49.250
-No big deal? Are you insane?
-Yeah.

44:49.333 --> 44:53.125
-What is wrong with you?
-Okay, fine. Fuck it. It's a big deal.

44:53.208 --> 44:55.708
-Yeah.
-Let's celebrate our good news together.

44:56.291 --> 44:58.833
Hmm. What did you have in mind?

45:05.333 --> 45:06.583
-[Jeremy grunts]
-I got it.

45:10.875 --> 45:12.041
How's your knee?

45:13.666 --> 45:14.791
It's good. Why?

45:15.916 --> 45:18.083
What? What, you wanna do some freaky shit?

45:18.708 --> 45:20.041
'Cause I can be talked into some stuff.

45:20.125 --> 45:21.791
-Come here.
-Shut up.

45:21.875 --> 45:23.875
["Oakland Blackouts" playing]

45:30.791 --> 45:32.416
[Jeremy] And a lot of it has to do withâ€¦

45:37.416 --> 45:39.583
[Kamal] All right, look, bro.
This is Watts, so watch your mouth.

45:39.666 --> 45:40.875
Don't say none of that slick shit.

45:40.958 --> 45:42.791
Don't look nobody in the eye
longer than you have to.

45:42.875 --> 45:44.583
-This shit ain't for play, all right?
-[Jeremy] Yep.

45:44.666 --> 45:47.041
Here they play five-on-five
and we should get picked up pretty quick.

45:47.125 --> 45:48.375
[Jeremy] Uh, don't worry. I got it.

45:50.000 --> 45:51.000
You ready?

45:52.291 --> 45:53.291
Born ready.

45:53.875 --> 45:54.875

46:05.208 --> 46:06.208

46:06.291 --> 46:09.125
I just wanted to see if you had
superhuman hearing 'cause of your--

46:09.208 --> 46:10.208
'Cause of my what?

46:11.708 --> 46:13.083
-Huh?
-It's all good.

-Fuck!

Look, I gotta tell you, those short shorts
look incredible on you.

46:59.333 --> 47:01.166
I mean,
you're so comfortable in your skin.

47:01.250 --> 47:02.625
Can I be honest, brother?

47:02.708 --> 47:05.041
Your shit is sitting in those. Sitting.

47:22.416 --> 47:25.333
I don't know how an independent woman
like yourself deals with it.

47:25.416 --> 47:26.416
Thank you.

47:26.500 --> 47:27.500
Mm-hmm.

47:28.208 --> 47:29.958

-Right? Yeah.

Don't do that again.

I'm just saying, bruh. It's organic.

48:21.625 --> 48:24.833
[Kamal] Man, stay focused.
We got way more games to play.

48:24.916 --> 48:27.416

-'Sup.

Why'd you let them pick your team?

run a credit card scam if you need cash?

take those fucking shades off?

52:12.916 --> 52:14.333
Fuck outta here, man.

52:14.416 --> 52:17.416

Yeah, my girl's a dancer.

52:37.791 --> 52:39.958
Shit, everybody girl is these days.

52:40.916 --> 52:42.583
No, a dancer dancer.

52:42.666 --> 52:43.750
Right.

52:45.375 --> 52:47.750

We're gonna be rolling in it, babe.
It's all good.

53:09.250 --> 53:11.916

as far as finances are concerned.

I got you.

53:13.583 --> 53:14.916
Thank you.

53:15.000 --> 53:18.083
For what? Being sexy? [chuckles]

53:19.333 --> 53:20.500
For being a good dude.

53:21.708 --> 53:22.875
Huh?

53:22.958 --> 53:24.791
For being a good dude.

53:26.916 --> 53:28.791
Yeah, you can thank my mom for that one.

53:28.875 --> 53:31.125
She put me on to Gilmore Girls
at a early age.

53:31.875 --> 53:34.541
That show really helped me connect with
the female point of view, you know?

53:34.625 --> 53:36.083
I thought it was Living Single.

53:36.166 --> 53:39.708
That too. Both were in heavy rotation.

53:44.458 --> 53:46.041
-[Tatiana] What is that?
-Ah.

53:46.708 --> 53:48.458

-Yeah!

54:03.458 --> 54:04.458
Oh, my God.

54:25.583 --> 54:27.041
Babe, come look at this spot.

54:27.125 --> 54:29.708
I think it'd be perfect for the salon.
Look.

Yeah.

54:41.333 --> 54:42.333
Anyways, look.

54:42.416 --> 54:46.750
If we keep staying smart with our money,
more clients coming in, and all goes well,

54:46.833 --> 54:48.250
this is the spot. That shit fire.

54:48.333 --> 54:49.416
It's dope. It's perfect.

Okay, I see you.

55:07.916 --> 55:10.583
-Jeremy got you back outside. Aight.

Look. I really don't want
my pops to find out, all right?

55:15.333 --> 55:17.333
I don't need him
feeling bad for not being there.

55:18.375 --> 55:19.375
Okay.

Bring some bitches.

Your boy came a long way
since I was serving fiends in the set.

Nah, nigga, them was Frenchies.

But that's neither here nor there.
This is what it's about, dog.

I mean, he hasn't played organized ball
since the night he got arrested.

58:40.000 --> 58:41.500
He's just nervous.

I don't like talking to them.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.875
They wanted me to fire you
over the phone, and I said,

01:02:50.958 --> 01:02:53.166
"No. We're buds. We've shared something.

01:02:53.250 --> 01:02:54.750

[Bobby] You? Definitely. Yes.
Uh, s-sorry, buddy. You are done.

01:03:08.708 --> 01:03:11.375
I guess I was being a little tougher
than normal on Jacoby or whatever,

and went full Latrell Sprewell on me,

he's too young to even get that reference.

01:04:01.291 --> 01:04:04.500
I mean, it's just incredibly unlike you
to jump into something so quickly.

01:04:04.583 --> 01:04:08.000
You cannot even get past your inflated
fucking ego to be excited for me.

01:04:08.083 --> 01:04:09.291

01:11:40.041 --> 01:11:44.583
My biggest regret is not giving you
the tools to work through your problems.

01:11:46.875 --> 01:11:49.791

just 'causeâ€¦

you playing ball again.

He's good at taking pictures.

He could probably set up a OnlyFans
if you put on little-ass VTX shorts,

01:13:56.916 --> 01:13:58.541

on a basketball game.

-Not worried about you losing.

my love language.

Mmm.

She thought it was gift giving,
but I'm more about physical touch.

Well, the greatest gift she could give you
is not touching you.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:41.583
Oh, he got him on lock.

01:20:42.291 --> 01:20:44.833
Danny Brown got the best defense in town!

01:20:45.583 --> 01:20:47.125
Switch, switch. Switch!

01:20:48.541 --> 01:20:50.458
[Lorenzo grunts]

01:20:54.208 --> 01:20:57.125
[QwessCoast] Oh, my God!

01:20:59.166 --> 01:21:01.291
I know this nigga Haitian.
His ancestors made me trip.

01:21:01.375 --> 01:21:02.833
Man-- Man, check that shit up.

01:21:05.541 --> 01:21:06.541
Swing it!

01:21:07.833 --> 01:21:10.375
[QwessCoast]
Kamal Allen's been on lock, man.

01:21:10.458 --> 01:21:13.000
It's like he on work release.
He can't never get out.

01:21:13.083 --> 01:21:14.333
Throw that shit, I got it!

01:21:21.375 --> 01:21:23.916
-Come on, man!
-That's what you came to do?

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.583
Time-out, man! Time-out!

01:21:26.666 --> 01:21:29.083
-[QwessCoast] Time-out, blue squad!
-Man, watch out.

01:21:30.250 --> 01:21:32.000
Hey, man,
what you doing throwing up that bullshit?

01:21:32.083 --> 01:21:33.708
You can't be out here
playing so fucking soft.

01:21:33.791 --> 01:21:35.458
-Soft? Man, you saw me slippin'.
-[Speedy] Shut up.

01:21:35.541 --> 01:21:37.333
The sun got in my eyes,
and all kinds of shit--

01:21:37.416 --> 01:21:39.500
[Jeremy] No! No. The spacing is trash.

01:21:39.583 --> 01:21:41.291
Everyone's watching each other
play iso ball.

01:21:41.375 --> 01:21:43.125
Have you ever heard of team basketball?

01:21:43.208 --> 01:21:45.625
[no audible dialogue]

01:21:45.708 --> 01:21:47.625
'Mal. What's happening? Talk to me.

01:21:48.875 --> 01:21:50.916
-Are you good?
-Yeah. I'm good.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:52.916
-Are you sure?
-Yes, bro. I'm good, I'm sure.

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:55.000
You're in.

01:21:55.083 --> 01:21:55.958
For who?

01:21:56.583 --> 01:21:57.583
Renzo.

01:21:57.666 --> 01:21:59.208
[stammers] What the fuck?

01:21:59.291 --> 01:22:01.166
What-- [stammering] Wait, wait, wait.

01:22:01.250 --> 01:22:03.916
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, what do you mean, bruh?

01:22:05.041 --> 01:22:06.041
It's for the best.

01:22:06.125 --> 01:22:07.125
It's for the best?

01:22:08.333 --> 01:22:10.083
That's how they got us on the boat.

01:22:10.166 --> 01:22:12.333
Hey. Look, your man's overplaying you
every time.

01:22:12.416 --> 01:22:14.208
Just cut backdoor, I'll find you.

01:22:15.166 --> 01:22:16.166
Bet.

01:22:17.875 --> 01:22:19.000
You sure you're good?

01:22:20.166 --> 01:22:21.583
Yeah. I'm good.

01:22:23.500 --> 01:22:24.500
All right.

01:22:27.083 --> 01:22:30.916
[breathing deeply]

01:22:42.916 --> 01:22:45.500
And breathe out, 'Mal. Just breathe.

01:22:46.458 --> 01:22:49.000
[both breathing deeply]

01:22:49.083 --> 01:22:52.083
Yo. What the fuck are y'all doing?

01:22:52.833 --> 01:22:53.958
[whistle blows]

01:22:54.916 --> 01:22:56.291
[QwessCoast] All right, it looks like

01:22:56.375 --> 01:22:59.375
Kamal Allen has subbed in
one of his partners forâ€¦

01:22:59.458 --> 01:23:01.041
a white boy?

01:23:08.125 --> 01:23:10.541
[QwessCoast] Pass inside to Allen
with the spin!

01:23:13.750 --> 01:23:15.000
Let's go!

01:23:15.083 --> 01:23:17.500
[QwessCoast] Looks like the white boy's
working out!

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:36.291
[QwessCoast] Off the step back!

01:23:36.375 --> 01:23:38.500
-He drains the three!
-Stay focused.

01:23:51.791 --> 01:23:54.041
[sound muffles]

01:24:07.083 --> 01:24:08.833
-[sound returns]
-[cheering]

01:24:13.250 --> 01:24:15.708
[QwessCoast]
What have I just witnessed, people?

01:24:16.250 --> 01:24:18.416
The blue team is headed to the chip!

01:24:18.500 --> 01:24:20.500
Y'all act like white men can't dunk.

01:24:28.416 --> 01:24:29.583
[QwessCoast] All right, now.

01:24:29.666 --> 01:24:33.375
This is it, people.
A half a million dollars on the line.

01:24:33.458 --> 01:24:35.875
The competition is fierce!

01:24:37.333 --> 01:24:39.125
[crowd clamors]

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.375
[QwessCoast] But Sweeney and the red team
are answering every point

01:24:44.458 --> 01:24:45.458
with their own.

01:24:47.916 --> 01:24:51.708
This that tit for tat,
dog-eat-dog streetball.

01:25:03.166 --> 01:25:04.833
We're at game point, people.

01:25:07.500 --> 01:25:09.916
The next team to sink a basket

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:14.291
wins the tournament and $500,000.

01:25:14.958 --> 01:25:17.000
-[grunts]
-[knees crunch]

01:25:17.083 --> 01:25:19.125
-[crowd] Oh!
-[grunts]

01:25:19.208 --> 01:25:20.958
[whistle blows]

01:25:21.041 --> 01:25:25.000
-[winces, groans]
-[QwessCoast] Aw, damn. That shit hurts.

01:25:25.083 --> 01:25:26.083
[Kamal] You okay?

01:25:27.250 --> 01:25:28.250
Talk to me.

01:25:28.875 --> 01:25:31.208
Come on, man. Come on. I got you. Come on.

01:25:32.166 --> 01:25:34.958
[QwessCoast] Come on, y'all.
Clap it up! Clap it up!

01:25:35.916 --> 01:25:38.750
[scoffs] Oh, look,
they wanna clap and shit.

01:25:39.958 --> 01:25:42.666
Can't go out like this again, 'Mal.
Not again. I can't.

01:25:42.750 --> 01:25:45.208
You're not going out like this, all right?
You got us here.

01:25:45.291 --> 01:25:47.500
We're gonna take it home for you.
I got you.

01:25:48.125 --> 01:25:50.000
Take your weak ass home, white boy.

01:25:50.083 --> 01:25:51.333
Shut the fuck up.

01:25:51.416 --> 01:25:52.583
The fuck you say to me?

01:25:52.666 --> 01:25:55.458
I already owe your homeboy
a ass whooping, what's up?

01:25:55.541 --> 01:25:57.208
-What'd you say?
-It's fine. Fuck this guy.

01:25:57.291 --> 01:25:59.708
Yeah, big time. Where yo daddy at?
I might fuck coz up too.

01:25:59.791 --> 01:26:01.125
-Fuck did you say to me?
-Yeah, yeah.

01:26:01.208 --> 01:26:03.250
Say that shit again, bitch. Say it again.

01:26:03.333 --> 01:26:04.541
[opposing fan] Get off me, bro!

01:26:04.625 --> 01:26:06.708
[people clamoring, screaming]

01:26:08.875 --> 01:26:10.083
[shouting indistinctly]

01:26:10.166 --> 01:26:12.333
[Jeremy] Hey. Hey.

01:26:12.416 --> 01:26:13.708
Hey!

01:26:15.500 --> 01:26:17.833
Breathe. I got this.

01:26:19.750 --> 01:26:22.541
-[breathes deeply]
-I got this.

01:26:24.250 --> 01:26:25.250
Look, cozâ€¦

01:26:25.833 --> 01:26:29.458
-Man, don't hobble your ass over here.
-No, we don't want any issues, okay?

01:26:29.541 --> 01:26:31.625
All we want is peace.
I'm sure we can solve this.

01:26:31.708 --> 01:26:32.750
Man, what?

01:26:32.833 --> 01:26:34.666
You know, me and the guys were just--

01:26:34.750 --> 01:26:35.750
[crowd clamors]

01:26:36.791 --> 01:26:38.208
Hey, he a nigga now, huh?

01:26:38.291 --> 01:26:39.458
Hey, get him, man!

01:26:39.541 --> 01:26:41.625
-[people clamoring and shouting]
-[whistle blowing]

01:26:42.708 --> 01:26:43.666
[whistle blows]

01:26:48.875 --> 01:26:50.166
Fuck is wrong with you, man?

01:26:50.250 --> 01:26:52.083
What happened to all that
"peace and positivity" shit?

01:26:52.166 --> 01:26:54.291
-I don't know.
-[QwessCoast] Chill out, man.

01:26:54.375 --> 01:26:56.791
Hey, y'all know
we just fucked up the bag, right?

01:26:56.875 --> 01:26:57.916
All right, all right!

01:26:58.750 --> 01:27:00.500
The white boy's got to go!

01:27:00.583 --> 01:27:01.791
Who?

01:27:02.375 --> 01:27:04.166
And the fan he assaulted!

01:27:04.250 --> 01:27:05.541
But they stay, right?

01:27:05.625 --> 01:27:07.125
We gonna finish the game without 'em.

01:27:07.208 --> 01:27:08.916
Let's keep the peace, people!

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:10.291
'Mal, you got this.

01:27:10.375 --> 01:27:11.916
I'll be here in spirit!

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:13.333
And so will your pops!

01:27:13.416 --> 01:27:16.208
You don't need therapy!
Basketball is your therapy!

01:27:18.208 --> 01:27:21.125
That was beautiful.
They gonna kill him in the parking lot.

01:27:22.500 --> 01:27:24.458
I ain't ever been to
a white man's funeral.

01:27:24.541 --> 01:27:27.125
-[Speedy] I was just gettin' to know him.
-[Lorenzo] Yeah. Good dude.

01:27:27.208 --> 01:27:28.333
[whistle blows]

01:27:29.916 --> 01:27:32.166
-[QwessCoast] All right. We back, y'all.
-D up!

01:27:32.250 --> 01:27:35.666
[QwessCoast] Ain't nobody
gonna stop this. Let's get to the bag!

01:27:36.625 --> 01:27:39.500
Sweeney's red team has possession.

01:27:40.416 --> 01:27:41.416
Hey, hey, watch him!

01:27:41.500 --> 01:27:44.541
[QwessCoast] All they gotta do is
make this next bucket.

01:27:49.833 --> 01:27:54.208
Red team pushes the D.
And Allen is back in the ball game.

01:28:01.291 --> 01:28:02.666
[basketball echoes]

01:28:02.750 --> 01:28:05.333
[Benji] Remember, your body's not tired,
it's your mind that's weak.

01:28:05.416 --> 01:28:07.583
You got haters in your head
trying to stop you from being great.

01:28:07.666 --> 01:28:08.708
You gotta keep 'em out your head.

01:28:09.416 --> 01:28:12.583
-[opposing fan] Kamal, where's your dad?
-[Benji] Just know I'll always be here.

01:28:14.041 --> 01:28:16.166
[Benji] Sixty-four. Last one.

01:28:17.958 --> 01:28:20.375
-[younger Kamal panting]
-[Benji] All right, all right.

01:28:21.833 --> 01:28:24.958
[breathes deeply]

01:28:25.041 --> 01:28:26.541
Body's not tired, son.

01:28:27.375 --> 01:28:28.458
Your mind is weak.

01:28:29.541 --> 01:28:30.541
Get ya mind right.

01:28:52.250 --> 01:28:54.541
[crowd cheering]

01:28:57.791 --> 01:29:00.833
[QwessCoast] Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

01:29:01.333 --> 01:29:03.958
It's over, people! It's over!

01:29:05.250 --> 01:29:09.458
Kamal Allen has led his blue team
to victory.

01:29:11.916 --> 01:29:17.416
They're $500,000 richer!
I can't believe it!

01:29:17.500 --> 01:29:21.083
I see you, Allen! This is crazy!

01:29:22.166 --> 01:29:23.750
Hey. Hey.

01:29:23.833 --> 01:29:25.250
[grunts] Here we go.

01:29:26.541 --> 01:29:28.666
Babe. He's gone, isn't he?

01:29:29.416 --> 01:29:30.458
[Imani] Yes.

01:29:32.708 --> 01:29:33.833
[cries]

01:29:40.875 --> 01:29:42.625
[Drew] Congratulations, Daddy!

01:29:42.708 --> 01:29:44.666
-[Kamal] Thanks, buddy.
-Look at that. Hey, I'ma take that.

01:29:44.750 --> 01:29:46.708
-Let me get a look. I'ma hold it.
-Hey, calm down.

01:29:46.791 --> 01:29:47.625
Tsk.

01:29:47.708 --> 01:29:49.125
[people speaking indistinctly]

01:29:49.208 --> 01:29:50.750
-Can I touch it? Just like--
-Not like that.

01:29:50.833 --> 01:29:52.041
Yo. Congrats, guys.

01:29:52.125 --> 01:29:54.541
-[chuckles]
-Ooh.

01:29:55.416 --> 01:29:56.416
That was, uh, riveting.

01:29:56.500 --> 01:29:57.958
-Congratulations again.
-Hey, yo.

01:29:58.041 --> 01:29:59.541
Mmm. [sniffs]

01:29:59.625 --> 01:30:00.916
Thank you, man. Thank you so much.

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:04.166
Yeah. No, this also counts as
community service, so let's get this pic.

01:30:05.375 --> 01:30:06.958
[Jeremy] Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

01:30:22.333 --> 01:30:24.166
-[Jeremy] Hey.
-Hey. [chuckles]

01:30:26.458 --> 01:30:27.458
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

01:30:34.541 --> 01:30:35.666
Thank you for coming.

01:30:37.833 --> 01:30:38.958
It's nice to see you.

01:30:41.958 --> 01:30:43.541
Uh, I just wanna say, you knowâ€¦

01:30:44.291 --> 01:30:45.500
That you're sorry?

01:30:46.125 --> 01:30:47.500
I know. You told me.

01:30:52.541 --> 01:30:54.583
All I wanted was for you to support me.

01:30:54.666 --> 01:30:56.666
-I know. I--
-It really fucked me up

01:30:56.750 --> 01:31:00.000
when you couldn't even be happy for me
for getting an opportunity.

01:31:00.083 --> 01:31:02.416
And I'll never forgive myself for that.

01:31:02.500 --> 01:31:05.291
I was all about me, and I lied to you.

01:31:06.541 --> 01:31:09.458
I was afraid that your dreams would
take you away from me,

01:31:09.541 --> 01:31:12.625
and I'm just [scoffs] some dumb loser.

01:31:12.708 --> 01:31:14.250
You're not a dumb loser.

01:31:14.333 --> 01:31:16.291
But that's what I became when you left.

01:31:22.166 --> 01:31:24.708
-[groans, winces]
-Jeremy.

01:31:24.791 --> 01:31:26.958
Oh, my knee. [winces]

01:31:27.041 --> 01:31:28.458
Are you okay?

01:31:28.541 --> 01:31:29.541
Are--

01:31:32.958 --> 01:31:35.666
I can train players
wherever your career takes us.

01:31:35.750 --> 01:31:37.500
I just wanna be with you, Tati.

01:31:38.083 --> 01:31:39.083
Will you marry me?

01:31:41.458 --> 01:31:43.041
Under the condition that I promise

01:31:43.125 --> 01:31:46.208
to never lie to you, neglect you,

01:31:46.291 --> 01:31:49.333
or be that asshole
who didn't appreciate you ever again.

01:31:52.708 --> 01:31:55.416
If you can get up without help,
I'll sleep on it.

01:31:56.750 --> 01:31:58.583
-I need your help.
-Do you really need help?

01:31:58.666 --> 01:32:00.375
-Pick me up, woman.
-[laughs]

01:32:00.458 --> 01:32:02.000
-[patron 1] Hey!
-[patron 2] Congratulations.

01:32:02.083 --> 01:32:03.500
[cheering]

01:32:15.125 --> 01:32:17.500
Hey, little boy.
Slow down, and say "excuse me."

01:32:18.250 --> 01:32:19.541
I'll check on you in a few.

01:32:19.625 --> 01:32:21.208
-What's happening, girl?
-Help me figure this out.

01:32:21.291 --> 01:32:22.625
Yeah. Please sit down.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:25.000
All right.

01:32:25.916 --> 01:32:27.250
All right, y'all, it's on. Here it is.

01:32:27.333 --> 01:32:30.416
[Taylor Rooks on TV] There's nothing
America loves more than a comeback story.

01:32:30.500 --> 01:32:31.666
Meet Kamal Allen.

01:32:31.750 --> 01:32:36.458
A former high school sensation
with a bit of a shaky past,

01:32:36.541 --> 01:32:39.666
but after absolutely dominating
in a local LA basketball tournament,

01:32:39.750 --> 01:32:42.958
he actually found himself
with a minimum contract overseas.

01:32:43.041 --> 01:32:45.625
-[people chanting] MVP! MVP!
-Let's go!

01:32:45.708 --> 01:32:47.083
Oh, my God.

01:32:47.166 --> 01:32:48.375
Finally doing somethin' right.

01:32:48.458 --> 01:32:50.083
I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding.

01:32:50.166 --> 01:32:51.791
You're playing really well in China,

01:32:51.875 --> 01:32:53.666
then you get a call from
the South Bay Lakers,

01:32:53.750 --> 01:32:55.166
the Lakers' G League affiliate,

01:32:55.250 --> 01:32:56.750
and then what happens next?

01:32:56.833 --> 01:32:58.833
Um. Yeah, no, so I, uh--

01:32:58.916 --> 01:33:00.500
I come back home to play for South Bay.

01:33:00.583 --> 01:33:02.458
Um, play in a couple games
in the G League,

01:33:02.541 --> 01:33:03.708
and then, you know, all of a sudden

01:33:03.791 --> 01:33:05.541
I get the call to come up
and play with the big dogs.

01:33:05.625 --> 01:33:07.375
-On a 10-day contract?
-Mm-hmm.

01:33:07.916 --> 01:33:10.958
-In your hometown. [chuckles]
-[chuckles] That's crazy, right?

01:33:11.041 --> 01:33:13.916
I mean, a big moment like this,
you can't do it alone.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.208
-Right.
-What has helped you along the way?

01:33:16.291 --> 01:33:17.125
[Kamal] Family.

01:33:17.208 --> 01:33:19.041
Shout-out to my wife, uh,

01:33:19.125 --> 01:33:21.541
you know, my son, and my pops.

01:33:21.625 --> 01:33:23.000
-Mm-hmm.
-[Kamal] And, uh--

01:33:23.083 --> 01:33:25.250
You know, a little while back,
I met this guy

01:33:25.333 --> 01:33:31.375
who introduced me to, you know, ginger
shots and turmeric and, uh, meditation.

01:33:31.875 --> 01:33:34.583
And, uh, you know,
that meditation really helped.

01:33:34.666 --> 01:33:35.666
Crazy dude, though.

01:33:35.750 --> 01:33:36.958
[Taylor, Kamal laughing]

01:33:37.041 --> 01:33:38.583
Could've at least said my name.

01:33:38.666 --> 01:33:40.541
It's bad enough that
they cut me out of the segment.

01:33:40.625 --> 01:33:41.625
[chuckles]

01:33:41.708 --> 01:33:44.708
I spent two days playing pickleball
with that weirdo producer.

01:33:44.791 --> 01:33:47.250
He called me
the "Red Flag Player Whisperer."

01:33:48.958 --> 01:33:50.083
[Lorenzo] Yo, Kamal!

01:33:50.166 --> 01:33:51.750
We did it, baby!

01:33:51.833 --> 01:33:54.583
Hey, we made it, man! Sizzler on me, man.

01:33:55.666 --> 01:33:59.916
What in the Dr. Miami? Oh. Mildred?

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:01.083
Is that M--

01:34:01.166 --> 01:34:03.083
Keep that same energy, bro. Excuse me.

01:34:04.875 --> 01:34:06.333
Can I have one? No.

01:34:06.416 --> 01:34:07.750
No, we don't play in snow.

01:34:09.083 --> 01:34:10.458
Yeah, but for real, though.

01:34:11.583 --> 01:34:13.000
I appreciate you, man.

01:34:14.083 --> 01:34:15.666
You know I wouldn't be here without you.

01:34:17.166 --> 01:34:18.416
You earned all of this.

01:34:19.541 --> 01:34:21.791
Hey, I'm legitimately happy for you.

01:34:21.875 --> 01:34:23.083
I'm happy for you.

01:34:23.583 --> 01:34:25.541
[trainee] Bro, get the fuck outta my face.

01:34:25.625 --> 01:34:28.458
I told you I'm not stretching shit! Go.

01:34:29.250 --> 01:34:31.166
Man, you need to go talk to your client?

01:34:31.875 --> 01:34:33.125
It's pregame. He's good.

01:34:33.750 --> 01:34:35.250
[Kamal] Damn, I never met Tyler Herro.

01:34:35.333 --> 01:34:36.416
Fuck!

01:34:36.500 --> 01:34:39.333
Isn't he supposed to be, like,
a real chill dude?

01:34:39.416 --> 01:34:41.291
No, they're trying to protect his image.

01:34:41.791 --> 01:34:43.416
He's got anger issues, for real.

01:34:44.125 --> 01:34:45.291
Fuck that shit, man.

01:34:46.375 --> 01:34:47.708
-[spectators yelling]
-[ball bangs]

01:34:47.791 --> 01:34:49.625
I should tap in, man. I'ma head out.

01:35:02.208 --> 01:35:03.041
[Jeremy] Hey.

01:35:03.125 --> 01:35:05.541
What do you want?
What could you possibly want?

01:35:05.625 --> 01:35:08.666
Relax, brother. Remember, you hired me.
I'm on your side.

01:35:08.750 --> 01:35:10.083
I get that, broâ€¦

01:35:10.166 --> 01:35:11.666
Bro, look where you're at.

01:35:12.458 --> 01:35:13.666
Look who you are.

01:35:13.750 --> 01:35:16.125
Now let's do our exercises.
You know what we do.

01:35:16.208 --> 01:35:17.500
Hands here. Put 'em here.

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:19.708
-Inhale.
-[breathes deeply]

01:35:20.375 --> 01:35:22.250
[Jeremy] Fill this balloon up for me.

01:35:22.333 --> 01:35:25.500
And release. Release for me.

01:35:26.333 --> 01:35:28.083
