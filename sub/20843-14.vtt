<i>Previously on "MasterChef,"</i>

00:04.408 --> 00:05.912

00:05.912 --> 00:07.248
‐ <i>paired up...</i>
‐ Whoo!

00:07.248 --> 00:08.183
Chicken, chicken, chicken,
chicken, chicken.

00:08.183 --> 00:10.320
I said elevate it.
That is not elevated.

00:10.320 --> 00:12.458
‐ <i>Adam and Caitlin...</i>
‐ Wow. Disgusting.

00:12.458 --> 00:14.930
<i>landed in</i>
<i>the dreaded pressure test...</i>

00:14.930 --> 00:17.167
‐ My signature chicken
and potato dish.
‐ Wow.

00:17.167 --> 00:19.005
Speed up, guys!
This is it!

00:19.005 --> 00:20.608
<i>where a Gordon Ramsay</i>
<i>classic...</i>

00:20.608 --> 00:23.046
‐ What's wrong with it? Right.
‐ It's raw in the middle.

00:23.046 --> 00:24.382
<i>brought Adam's</i>
<i>MasterChef dream...</i>

00:24.382 --> 00:26.219
‐ Bye, Adam!
‐ <i>to an end.</i>

00:29.626 --> 00:31.530
<i>Tonight...</i>

00:31.530 --> 00:32.999
‐ Switch!
‐ Oh, God!

00:32.999 --> 00:34.636
‐ Go, go!
‐ Boom.

00:34.636 --> 00:36.874
‐ <i>it's a tag‐team challenge...</i>
‐ Speed up, let's go!

00:36.874 --> 00:37.876
Get those
taquitos going.

00:37.876 --> 00:38.878
Shred, shred, shred!

00:38.878 --> 00:40.180
<i>...from south</i>
<i>of the border.</i>

00:40.180 --> 00:41.349
Get 'em in the fryer.
Let's go!

00:41.349 --> 00:43.588
‐ Come on!
‐ <i>And the top nine...</i>

00:43.588 --> 00:45.525
Does it need a flip?
Does it need a flip?

00:45.525 --> 00:46.760
‐ <i>feel the heat...</i>
‐ Whoo!

00:46.760 --> 00:48.598
‐ Damn it!
‐ <i>...like never before.</i>

00:48.598 --> 00:50.200
‐ ( shrieks )
‐ Use a fork, use a fork.

00:50.200 --> 00:51.604
Let me do this ( bleep ),
all right?

00:51.604 --> 00:52.706
Get it in the pan!
You don't have time for that!

00:52.706 --> 00:54.710
Stop sounding stupid!

00:54.710 --> 00:56.179
‐ Oh, my God!
‐ Wake up!

00:56.179 --> 00:57.047
This is horrible.

01:13.648 --> 01:15.752
‐ ( cheering )
‐ Aarón: Welcome, everyone.

01:15.752 --> 01:18.056
Oh, my God, top nine
in "MasterChef."

01:18.056 --> 01:19.526
<i>Competition is getting</i>
<i>real tight.</i>

01:19.526 --> 01:20.928
All right.

01:20.928 --> 01:22.766
Please, home cooks,
head to your stations.

01:22.766 --> 01:25.337
Jason: <i>As a teacher,</i>
<i>I always think about</i>
<i>other people,</i>

01:25.337 --> 01:27.041
<i>but this is a competition.</i>
<i>If I wanna win,</i>

01:27.041 --> 01:29.713
I have to start
thinking about me.

01:29.713 --> 01:32.719
Welcome once again
to the amazing
MasterChef kitchen.

01:32.719 --> 01:35.725
Nine of you stand
before us tonight,

01:35.725 --> 01:38.096
but just one of you
will win a quarter
of a million dollars,

01:38.096 --> 01:41.637
a guaranteed spot
on the next MasterChef cruise,

01:41.637 --> 01:43.574
and of course,
the MasterChef trophy.

01:43.574 --> 01:45.778
Woohoo!

01:45.778 --> 01:48.784
It's now time for
your next mystery box
challenge.

01:52.792 --> 01:54.996
On the count of three,
lift those boxes.

01:54.996 --> 01:56.734
One...

01:56.734 --> 01:58.069
two...

01:58.069 --> 01:59.271
three, lift.

01:59.271 --> 02:01.577
‐ ( cheering )
‐ Oh, my gosh.

02:01.577 --> 02:03.079
‐ Delicious.
‐ Beautiful.

02:03.079 --> 02:04.348
Underneath
your mystery boxes

02:04.348 --> 02:06.787
you have an incredible array
of amazing ingredients,

02:06.787 --> 02:09.926
and they all revolve
around breakfast.

02:09.926 --> 02:12.097
‐ All right.
‐ Woo!

02:12.097 --> 02:14.636
You have Greek yogurt,
hazelnuts,

02:14.636 --> 02:17.040
raspberries,
dried banana chips,

02:17.040 --> 02:19.078
blueberries,
blood oranges,

02:19.078 --> 02:20.548
and at the center
of it all,

02:20.548 --> 02:24.421
you'll find Nutella,
the original hazelnut spread.

02:24.421 --> 02:25.658
Mm‐hmm.

02:25.658 --> 02:26.827
Eboni:
<i>Back in Chicago,</i>

02:26.827 --> 02:28.329
<i>we eat Nutella</i>
<i>on a regular basis,</i>

02:28.329 --> 02:30.233
<i>and I know what flavors</i>
<i>match well with it.</i>

02:30.233 --> 02:32.939
I think my kids
sent this one for me.

02:32.939 --> 02:35.912
Now, Nutella originated
in Italy over 50 years ago.

02:35.912 --> 02:38.517
It has become a brand icon
in various countries,

02:38.517 --> 02:42.324
thanks to a constantly
growing fan base.

02:42.324 --> 02:44.195
Tonight for
your mystery box challenge,

02:44.195 --> 02:47.802
we want to see all of you
cook a MasterChef worthy
breakfast starring,

02:47.802 --> 02:51.309
of course, the one‐of‐a‐kind
hazelnut spread, Nutella.

02:51.309 --> 02:54.950
‐ Cool.
‐ But not just
any breakfast.

02:54.950 --> 02:57.522
We want to see you
take these ingredients,

02:57.522 --> 03:00.026
and create a dish
that is reminiscent

03:00.026 --> 03:01.663
of your favorite
family breakfast.

03:01.663 --> 03:04.970
You'll have just one hour
to complete this dish,

03:04.970 --> 03:07.307
and the winner tonight
will get a huge advantage

03:07.307 --> 03:08.944
in the next challenge.

03:08.944 --> 03:10.948
And trust me,
you want that advantage.

03:10.948 --> 03:12.184
‐ Yeah.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

03:12.184 --> 03:14.589
‐ Are we ready?
‐ All: Yes, Chef.

03:14.589 --> 03:15.423
Your 60 minutes...

03:17.528 --> 03:18.429
starts...

03:20.433 --> 03:21.703
...now.

03:29.184 --> 03:32.057
I'm gonna be making
Nutella‐stuffed
doughnut holes today,

03:32.057 --> 03:34.395
with an espresso blood orange
sabayon dipping sauce.

03:34.395 --> 03:36.667
As a kid,
after a dance recital,

03:36.667 --> 03:38.069
my mom would take me
to the doughnut store,

03:38.069 --> 03:39.639
and get a big box
of doughnut holes,

03:39.639 --> 03:41.810
so this is
kind of an homage to my mom

03:41.810 --> 03:43.012
for being
my biggest supporter.

03:47.822 --> 03:50.594
I'm gonna do
a Nutella‐stuffed waffle

03:50.594 --> 03:52.598
that's gonna be done up
with a nice blood orange

03:52.598 --> 03:54.268
cream cheese frosting
into the middle,

03:54.268 --> 03:56.907
caramelized bananas,
strawberry compote.

03:56.907 --> 03:59.011
The flavors
are going to work.

03:59.011 --> 04:00.948
My fiancée and I,
we absolutely love
sweets like this,

04:00.948 --> 04:02.384
and we cook it quite often.

04:02.384 --> 04:04.021
Trying some new ideas out,

04:04.021 --> 04:05.223
and seeing where I can
go with it.

04:08.530 --> 04:10.835
Perfect.

04:10.835 --> 04:15.711
Now, top nine,
mystery box challenge
featuring Nutella.

04:15.711 --> 04:18.650
We're looking
for a beautiful
breakfast dish.

04:18.650 --> 04:21.255
‐ How do you elevate breakfast?
‐ You gotta get creative.

04:21.255 --> 04:23.426
Is it a crepe?
Is it a pancake?
Is it a waffle?

04:23.426 --> 04:25.397
Where do you go
with this in 60 minutes?

04:25.397 --> 04:27.200
Aarón: And think about
what Nutella really has.

04:27.200 --> 04:28.771
We're talking about
chocolate and hazelnut.

04:28.771 --> 04:31.242
What are the flavors
that hazelnut loves?

04:31.242 --> 04:33.379
Citrus‐‐ blood oranges,
which is lovely.

04:33.379 --> 04:35.618
Something creamy and rich,
like bananas.

04:35.618 --> 04:38.557
I'm looking for color.
I want to see some
texture somewhere.

04:38.557 --> 04:41.028
I would love to see a baked
confection of some kind.

04:41.028 --> 04:44.134
‐ Yeah, absolutely.
‐ And that for me is gonna
really raise an eyebrow.

04:49.579 --> 04:51.716
As an Italian,
Nutella was everywhere.

04:51.716 --> 04:54.121
I was always around it.
Very familiar with it.

04:54.121 --> 04:56.392
Growing up,
it was either fruits, crepes,
which my mother loves,

04:56.392 --> 04:58.931
or leftover sushi,
so I'm putting
the two together,

04:58.931 --> 05:00.534
and I'm making a fruit sushi.

05:00.534 --> 05:03.272
I'm gonna incorporate
Nutella with the crepe
as sort of the roll.

05:03.272 --> 05:04.408
You're gonna get
your perfect Nutella taste.

05:11.355 --> 05:12.592
‐ Miss Cate.
‐ Hi, Chef.

05:12.592 --> 05:14.228
Talk to me
about breakfast.

05:14.228 --> 05:15.965
What were
some of those memories
growing up in Chicago?

05:15.965 --> 05:19.371
When I thought of Nutella,
I thought of Christmastime

05:19.371 --> 05:22.945
when my mom makes cheesecake,
and we would just, like,

05:22.945 --> 05:24.248
walk past and steal 'em
or hide 'em

05:24.248 --> 05:25.951
and try to eat them
for breakfast the next day.

05:25.951 --> 05:27.287
Outstanding. So is that
what you're doing?

05:27.287 --> 05:30.059
Yep, I'm gonna make
Nutella swirl cheesecake,

05:30.059 --> 05:33.132
Greek yogurt and Nutella
whipped cream.

05:33.132 --> 05:34.602
That sounds great.
Make your mom proud
with those‐‐

05:34.602 --> 05:35.938
‐ I will.
‐ those cheesecakes.

05:35.938 --> 05:37.307
‐ Keep going.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

05:37.307 --> 05:39.679
Aarón:
Everyone, 30 minutes.
Halfway gone.

05:39.679 --> 05:40.848
Gordon:
Jason, what are we doing?

05:40.848 --> 05:44.421
I am making
a hazelnut Nutella torte

05:44.421 --> 05:46.760
with some candied
hazelnut garnishes.

05:46.760 --> 05:49.331
This reminds me
of a birthday cake
that somebody made for me,

05:49.331 --> 05:50.601
and so it's nostalgic.

05:50.601 --> 05:51.703
Incredible.
So you've made the base.

05:51.703 --> 05:52.772
What is it, short crust?

05:52.772 --> 05:54.441
Uh, actually,
it's blended hazelnuts

05:54.441 --> 05:57.147
with sugar and egg
to get frothy.

05:57.147 --> 05:59.017
I'm gonna layer it
with Nutella whipped cream.

05:59.017 --> 06:01.088
‐ Any acidity in there?
‐ I've made a little bit

06:01.088 --> 06:03.259
of caramel sauce
that has Nutella
and blood oranges in it.

06:03.259 --> 06:04.996
I'll add some
espresso powder,

06:04.996 --> 06:06.800
'cause when I think of morning,
I think coffee as well.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.169
‐ Sure. Good luck.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

06:11.075 --> 06:13.079
I'm gonna turn you up
a little bit.

06:13.079 --> 06:14.481
‐ All right, Miss Eboni.
‐ Hey, Chef.

06:14.481 --> 06:15.651
What are you
making tonight?

06:15.651 --> 06:17.254
I'm making
Nutella waffles.

06:17.254 --> 06:20.026
I'm gonna do a coconut
and orange whipped cream,

06:20.026 --> 06:21.495
then I'm gonna try
to make a real quick,

06:21.495 --> 06:23.332
like, raspberry coulis,
just to give the plate
some color.

06:23.332 --> 06:25.704
I love it.
What does breakfast
usually look like at home?

06:25.704 --> 06:28.009
Um, breakfast, usually,
I'll do something like this.

06:28.009 --> 06:31.282
I'll do waffles for my kids.
They eat a lot of Nutella.

06:31.282 --> 06:33.854
Never particularly made
Nutella waffles for them,

06:33.854 --> 06:35.724
but I make them other
Nutella‐type dishes.

06:35.724 --> 06:36.893
‐ You can do this, mama.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

06:36.893 --> 06:37.795
Channel that family.

06:39.331 --> 06:40.901
Gordon:
Guys, we're down
to 10 minutes.

06:40.901 --> 06:43.039
This is it. Come on.

06:43.039 --> 06:43.974
‐ Aarón: Gabriel.
‐ Yes, Chef?

06:43.974 --> 06:45.476
Talk to me about breakfast.

06:45.476 --> 06:46.913
What does that
look like at your house?

06:46.913 --> 06:47.882
My dad, he's up
early in the morning.

06:47.882 --> 06:49.151
He likes to
go get doughnuts,

06:49.151 --> 06:50.053
so I'm gonna do
a doughnut today.

06:50.053 --> 06:52.223
And I'm gonna fill it
with the Nutella

06:52.223 --> 06:53.492
that I mixed with a little bit
of the Greek yogurt,

06:53.492 --> 06:54.996
to give it
a little bit of tang,

06:54.996 --> 06:57.367
and then I'm going to top it
with a little blueberry sauce,

06:57.367 --> 06:59.171
‐ and I got
a nice espresso syrup.
‐ Cool.

06:59.171 --> 07:00.574
So you haven't been
in the top three

07:00.574 --> 07:02.110
in these mystery boxes yet.

07:02.110 --> 07:03.513
We need to see some confidence
out of you, young man, okay?

07:03.513 --> 07:04.515
I think the flavors
will deliver.

07:04.515 --> 07:05.818
‐ Okay, good luck.
‐ Thank you.

07:05.818 --> 07:07.521
Yes, beautiful.

07:09.992 --> 07:11.730
‐ Yummy.
‐ Gordon: Smells incredible.
Come on. Seriously, come on.

07:11.730 --> 07:13.867
‐ It does, yes.
‐ Get a load
of what Cate's doing.

07:13.867 --> 07:15.904
She's making miniature
cream cheese cakes

07:15.904 --> 07:18.209
and then a ganache
using Nutella.

07:18.209 --> 07:20.514
Christina:
Now, Caitlin, she's
making doughnut holes

07:20.514 --> 07:21.683
that she's gonna stuff
with Nutella.

07:21.683 --> 07:22.918
‐ Smart.
‐ She's got a sort of

07:22.918 --> 07:25.490
blood orange, espresso,
sabayon dipping sauce.

07:25.490 --> 07:27.327
‐ That sounds incredible.
‐ If she can pull it off,

07:27.327 --> 07:28.162
she's got it in the bag.

07:30.768 --> 07:32.505
Gordon:
90 seconds remaining,

07:32.505 --> 07:35.042
and for one of you,
a huge advantage.

07:35.042 --> 07:36.780
Let's go, guys.

07:36.780 --> 07:39.919
Taste everything,
and make those plates
look incredible.

07:42.190 --> 07:44.261
‐ Christina: Come on guys.
‐ Let's go! Presentation!

07:45.964 --> 07:47.768
Christina:
Move! Let's go!

07:47.768 --> 07:49.772
‐ Gordon: Ten...
‐ Judges: Nine, eight,

07:49.772 --> 07:52.812
seven, six, five,

07:52.812 --> 07:55.984
four, three, two, one.

07:55.984 --> 07:57.086
‐ And stop.
Hands in the air.
‐ That's it.

07:57.086 --> 07:58.289
‐ Yay!
‐ Well done!

08:03.499 --> 08:04.602
Christina:
<i>Well done, everyone.</i>

08:04.602 --> 08:06.539
Tonight you all
had to show us

08:06.539 --> 08:08.877
what kind
of nostalgic breakfast

08:08.877 --> 08:11.683
you could create
using Nutella.

08:11.683 --> 08:13.687
Now while you worked
at your stations,

08:13.687 --> 08:15.724
we had a chance
to watch you cook

08:15.724 --> 08:17.393
and taste elements
from each of your dishes

08:17.393 --> 08:19.264
as you put them together.

08:19.264 --> 08:21.268
Aarón: The first dish
that we would like to taste,

08:21.268 --> 08:23.239
this home cook made a dough,

08:23.239 --> 08:27.581
and used Nutella very
creatively inside the dough.

08:27.581 --> 08:30.286
It's this home cook's
first time in the top three.

08:30.286 --> 08:31.956
Step forward...

08:31.956 --> 08:33.827
‐ Gabriel.
‐ Yes!

08:33.827 --> 08:37.000
‐ Good job, brother!
‐ I am kind of shocked.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.337
I did not think
my name was gonna be called.

08:39.337 --> 08:41.843
<i>I feel like the first day</i>
<i>when I came into the kitchen.</i>

08:41.843 --> 08:44.147
<i>That enthusiasm, that fire</i>
<i>is definitely relit.</i>

08:44.147 --> 08:46.151
<i>I'm finally showing</i>
<i>that I'm not just a fluke.</i>

08:46.151 --> 08:47.922
Gabriel, talk to me
about your dish.

08:47.922 --> 08:50.527
Yes, Chef.
So today I have a play on
coffee and doughnuts.

08:50.527 --> 08:53.365
<i>I have a buttermilk doughnut</i>
<i>filled with Nutella,</i>

08:53.365 --> 08:55.436
<i>that I mixed with</i>
<i>a little bit of Greek yogurt.</i>

08:55.436 --> 08:57.340
<i>It's topped</i>
<i>with a blueberry glaze,</i>

08:57.340 --> 08:59.545
<i>toasted hazelnuts,</i>
<i>and a little blood orange</i>
<i>and lemon zest,</i>

08:59.545 --> 09:01.616
<i>‐ and an espresso syrup.</i>
<i>‐</i> Aarón: Wow.

09:01.616 --> 09:03.620
I love the forward thinking
of glazing it

09:03.620 --> 09:06.291
so the hazelnuts would adhere
to the outside of the doughnut.

09:06.291 --> 09:09.064
‐ What'd you dip it in?
‐ I dipped it
in a blueberry glaze.

09:09.064 --> 09:11.101
I just reduced
a little bit of blueberries
with some sugar,

09:11.101 --> 09:12.771
some lemon juice,
and a little bit of water.

09:15.944 --> 09:18.015
Where has this been hiding?

09:18.015 --> 09:19.585
I don't know, Chef.

09:19.585 --> 09:20.787
Aarón: I love it.

09:20.787 --> 09:22.625
The batter itself
is fantastic.

09:22.625 --> 09:24.160
I love the freshness
from the blueberry.

09:24.160 --> 09:26.966
And that espresso sauce
gives a beautiful bitterness

09:26.966 --> 09:30.206
that really reinforces
the flavor of the Nutella.

09:30.206 --> 09:33.312
I'm happy to see you finally
show up to this competition.

09:33.312 --> 09:34.715
Keep cooking like that,
you're gonna go far.

09:34.715 --> 09:35.617
Thank you, Chef.

09:38.890 --> 09:40.527
Gordon:
Gabriel, visually,

09:40.527 --> 09:42.363
one of the most
stunning dishes tonight,
let's get that right.

09:42.363 --> 09:43.733
Where does this stem from?

09:43.733 --> 09:45.704
It really stems from my dad.

09:45.704 --> 09:47.340
He was
the doughnut connoisseur,
and still is.

09:47.340 --> 09:50.346
He could tell you
the best doughnut shops
in any city in Oklahoma.

09:52.518 --> 09:54.822
It's delicious.
I think you've done
a great job.

09:54.822 --> 09:57.226
You know, it's soft,
it's creamy, not dry.
What would I change?

09:57.226 --> 09:59.832
I would love to have seen
a bit more Nutella
in the center,

09:59.832 --> 10:03.405
but I just love the fact
that you had the balls to make
doughnuts in 60 minutes,

10:03.405 --> 10:07.013
where professional pastry chefs
spend six to seven hours.

10:07.013 --> 10:12.524
You may be 19,
but you definitely deserve
to be in the top nine.

10:12.524 --> 10:13.860
‐ Thank you, Chef.
‐ Great job.

10:13.860 --> 10:15.731
‐ Thank you, Chef.
‐ Woohoo! Go, Gabe!

10:15.731 --> 10:18.068
‐ Good job, Gabriel.
‐ Go, Gabriel.

10:18.068 --> 10:19.538
Thank you, Chefs.

10:19.538 --> 10:21.943
Good job, buddy.

10:21.943 --> 10:25.082
The second dish
we'd like to examine
a little further,

10:25.082 --> 10:28.923
this dish was put together
by a home cook

10:28.923 --> 10:32.163
that used Nutella in more
than one application.

10:32.163 --> 10:33.165
Please step forward...

10:35.436 --> 10:38.108
‐ Jason.
‐ Yes, Jason!

10:38.108 --> 10:40.112
Jason:
<i>I put my heart and soul</i>
<i>into this dish.</i>

10:40.112 --> 10:43.753
It demonstrates baking,
sugar work, sauce work.

10:43.753 --> 10:46.158
<i>It's really</i>
<i>just a crystallization</i>

10:46.158 --> 10:48.596
of all the ideas that are
swimming around in my head.

10:48.596 --> 10:51.001
‐ Gordon: Wow, come on.
‐ I tried my best.

10:51.001 --> 10:52.303
Talk to me
about that cake.

10:52.303 --> 10:54.809
I have for you today
a hazelnut torte

10:54.809 --> 10:58.048
<i>with a Nutella‐coffee</i>
<i>whipped cream icing.</i>

10:58.048 --> 10:59.685
<i>There is</i>
<i>a blood orange chip,</i>

10:59.685 --> 11:01.589
<i>and then the sauce</i>
<i>is a caramel</i>

11:01.589 --> 11:03.760
<i>with blood orange</i>
<i>and Nutella,</i>

11:03.760 --> 11:04.762
<i>a little bit</i>
<i>of hazelnut brittle,</i>

11:04.762 --> 11:06.231
<i>and blood orange supremes.</i>

11:06.231 --> 11:08.670
This is one
of the most beautiful

11:08.670 --> 11:11.843
dishes I have ever seen
in MasterChef history.

11:11.843 --> 11:15.851
‐ Thank you, Chef.
‐ I mean, it's stained glass.

11:15.851 --> 11:18.255
It's gorgeous.
Are you a big baker?

11:18.255 --> 11:21.863
I mean, I just enjoyed
the technical aspect of it,

11:21.863 --> 11:23.298
'cause a lot of
the Asian cooking that I do,

11:23.298 --> 11:27.006
there's no dairy,
there's no flour,
no butter elements,

11:27.006 --> 11:30.012
so it's kind of
a fun playground for me.

11:30.012 --> 11:31.616
Jason, come on.

11:31.616 --> 11:33.519
I'm wowed.

11:33.519 --> 11:34.722
There's a savory
nature to it.

11:34.722 --> 11:36.859
It's not sweet.
It's hearty.

11:36.859 --> 11:39.464
I think those fresh
supremes of blood orange
are really smart,

11:39.464 --> 11:41.869
and that basil
is a very nice touch
at the end.

11:41.869 --> 11:43.472
It's fresh.
The one point of feedback

11:43.472 --> 11:45.209
I'd give you
is in that frosting.

11:45.209 --> 11:47.881
Consistency‐wise,
it's a little thick,

11:47.881 --> 11:51.421
but that's me nitpicking,
because what you have
brought forward

11:51.421 --> 11:54.093
‐ is a true masterpiece.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

11:54.093 --> 11:55.429
‐ Nice job, sir.
‐ Thank you very much.
Thank you.

11:57.333 --> 11:59.437
Aarón:
Jason, what is in the sauce?

11:59.437 --> 12:02.678
The sauce is blood orange,
Nutella, and caramel.

12:04.047 --> 12:06.151
The cake,
it's airy and nutty,

12:06.151 --> 12:08.556
and it's just really
fun to eat.

12:08.556 --> 12:11.027
The caramel with the nuts?
Unbelievable.

12:11.027 --> 12:12.664
And even
the little teardrops

12:12.664 --> 12:15.069
of the hazelnut on top
is just remarkable.

12:15.069 --> 12:17.808
What I appreciate the most
is the blood orange.

12:17.808 --> 12:19.912
It's that beautiful
floral citrus

12:19.912 --> 12:21.381
that you just can't
get enough of.

12:21.381 --> 12:22.584
‐ Well done.
‐ Thank you very much, Chef.

12:22.584 --> 12:24.220
Go, Jason!

12:24.220 --> 12:25.724
‐ Good job, Jason!
‐ Nice job!

12:28.395 --> 12:29.932
Now the third
and final dish

12:29.932 --> 12:32.938
we'd like to take
a much closer look at.

12:32.938 --> 12:37.948
This talented home cook
used Nutella tonight
in several ways.

12:37.948 --> 12:41.187
Visually, it's got
that wow factor.

12:41.187 --> 12:42.189
Please come down...

12:44.227 --> 12:46.532
‐ Cate.
‐ Ah‐ha!

12:46.532 --> 12:48.903
‐ Good job, Cate.
‐ Cate: <i>Yes. Like, I've won</i>
<i>a mystery box before,</i>

12:48.903 --> 12:50.774
<i>so this is</i>
<i>a huge deal to me.</i>

12:50.774 --> 12:53.278
I made this cheesecake
that represents my family

12:53.278 --> 12:55.282
<i>and I'm just hoping</i>
<i>that the judges</i>

12:55.282 --> 12:57.988
taste the love
inside this cheesecake,

12:57.988 --> 13:01.261
and that's enough
to get me the win today.

13:01.261 --> 13:02.430
Visually,
it's breathtaking.

13:02.430 --> 13:04.267
Describe the dish, please.

13:04.267 --> 13:07.841
<i>It is my mom's</i>
<i>cheesecake ala Nutella,</i>

13:07.841 --> 13:10.613
<i>with a Nutella swirl inside.</i>

13:10.613 --> 13:13.351
<i>And then I made a Nutella</i>
<i>Greek yogurt whipped cream,</i>

13:13.351 --> 13:15.089
<i>and Nutella ganache.</i>

13:15.089 --> 13:18.228
So why down this route?

13:18.228 --> 13:21.635
Well, you asked for something
that is nostalgic,

13:21.635 --> 13:24.373
and I immediately thought
of Christmas Eve

13:24.373 --> 13:26.645
when my mom would make,
like, 200 cheesecakes

13:26.645 --> 13:28.215
for the elderly
and handicapped.

13:28.215 --> 13:30.119
I just saw how
she treated other people,

13:30.119 --> 13:32.991
and I think you'll
taste that in the cheesecake.

13:32.991 --> 13:34.728
So at the bottom,
you've got coconut.
What else?

13:34.728 --> 13:36.899
It's toasted coconut,
some oats to, actually,

13:36.899 --> 13:38.301
like, absorb the butter.

13:41.074 --> 13:44.447
Respect to Mom,
because it's delicious.

13:44.447 --> 13:47.286
It's light, it's creamy.
It's incredibly sumptuous.

13:47.286 --> 13:48.856
I'd like to see
a touch more Nutella

13:48.856 --> 13:50.994
‐ at the base
of that cheesecake.
‐ Yeah.

13:50.994 --> 13:53.933
However, the ganache
is smooth, rich.

13:53.933 --> 13:57.807
Continue cooking like this
and you could be in the finale.

13:57.807 --> 13:59.377
‐ Great job.
‐ Thank you so much, Chef.

14:01.147 --> 14:03.920
And what's that ratio
of cream cheese
to Greek yogurt

14:03.920 --> 14:05.489
in that filling there?
What's the secret?

14:05.489 --> 14:08.061
It's 16 ounces
of cream cheese,

14:08.061 --> 14:10.499
and then a half cup
of the yogurt.

14:10.499 --> 14:12.403
‐ Girl, it's good!
‐ Thanks!

14:12.403 --> 14:14.808
It doesn't taste
like a cheesecake
necessarily for dessert.

14:14.808 --> 14:17.479
That salt is very helpful
in the balance of it.

14:17.479 --> 14:20.987
The hazelnut and oat crust,
it's sweet, it's nutty.

14:20.987 --> 14:23.693
I love your vision.
I love that personal
connection.

14:23.693 --> 14:26.264
You made
a delicious cheesecake,
and I love that crust.

14:26.264 --> 14:28.836
‐ Very nice job.
‐ Thank you so much, Chef.

14:28.836 --> 14:32.142
Whoo!

14:32.142 --> 14:34.013
They're exciting.
I would eat
all three of those.

14:40.125 --> 14:43.365
We saw three
stunning breakfast dishes
using Nutella.

14:44.701 --> 14:47.741
But, sadly, there can
only be one winner.

14:51.247 --> 14:54.420
The home cook receiving
a major advantage

14:54.420 --> 14:56.992
in the upcoming challenge...

14:56.992 --> 14:57.861
that person is...

15:08.783 --> 15:11.387
The home cook receiving
a major advantage

15:11.387 --> 15:13.058
in the upcoming challenge...

15:16.497 --> 15:19.236
that person is...

15:19.236 --> 15:21.374
‐ Jason.
‐ All right, Jason!

15:21.374 --> 15:23.244
Thank you. Thank you.

15:23.244 --> 15:26.484
The fact that my hazelnut torte
has won the mystery box,

15:26.484 --> 15:29.190
<i>it's a validation</i>
<i>that I know what I'm doing.</i>

15:29.190 --> 15:32.062
Come on up here,
let's go.

15:32.062 --> 15:33.566
Everybody else, please make
your way down to the front.

15:33.566 --> 15:35.703
Thank you.
Line up, please, let's go.

15:35.703 --> 15:39.377
Spring in the step.
Let's go. Excellent.

15:39.377 --> 15:42.550
Christina: Jason,
because you won tonight's
mystery box challenge,

15:42.550 --> 15:44.186
you are safe
from elimination.

15:44.186 --> 15:45.857
Thank you.

15:45.857 --> 15:49.029
You are about to receive
a game‐changing advantage.

15:49.029 --> 15:50.232
Aarón:
That's right, tonight

15:50.232 --> 15:52.136
you will be making
a number of decisions

15:52.136 --> 15:53.739
that could send your
toughest competition home.

15:53.739 --> 15:55.242
Oh, my goodness.

15:55.242 --> 15:56.745
All of these
home cooks right here

15:56.745 --> 16:00.051
are gonna be competing
in teams of two.

16:00.051 --> 16:02.489
‐ Guess who gets
to pick those teams?
‐ Maybe me?

16:02.489 --> 16:03.659
That's right, Jason decides

16:03.659 --> 16:05.863
who'll be paired up
for tonight's challenge.

16:05.863 --> 16:10.439
But this isn't
just any old
elimination challenge.

16:10.439 --> 16:13.244
Tonight's challenge
separates

16:13.244 --> 16:15.616
the cooks from the chefs.

16:15.616 --> 16:18.021
The most grueling,
the most frustrating,

16:18.021 --> 16:20.292
the difficult
tag team challenge.

16:24.300 --> 16:28.475
Jason, tell us who you'd like
to see go home tonight.

16:29.978 --> 16:32.316
I think my number one
competition is Cate.

16:32.316 --> 16:33.986
‐ Damn.
‐ Gordon: Interesting.

16:33.986 --> 16:35.088
Cate, please,
come and step over there.

16:35.088 --> 16:37.627
There you are.

16:37.627 --> 16:39.598
Now, who are you going
to pair with her?

16:41.167 --> 16:43.639
Jason: This home cook
has great ideas,

16:43.639 --> 16:45.576
but sometimes
they're unpredictable.

16:45.576 --> 16:47.346
That might be
a clash with Cate,

16:47.346 --> 16:49.450
so that home cook is Dino.

16:49.450 --> 16:53.191
‐ Dino, please, join Cate.
‐ Come on, boo.

16:53.191 --> 16:54.528
Cate:
<i>I'm a little concerned.</i>

16:54.528 --> 16:56.999
Sometimes Dino can get
carried away here and there,

16:56.999 --> 16:59.270
<i>but if I can just</i>
<i>keep him in line,</i>

16:59.270 --> 17:00.540
<i>we're gonna be okay.</i>

17:00.540 --> 17:02.544
Jason, who is
the next home cook

17:02.544 --> 17:05.382
‐ that you want to target?
‐ Yachecia.

17:05.382 --> 17:09.256
Yachecia just has such
a depth of flavor and emotion
when she's cooking.

17:09.256 --> 17:11.562
Out of these
five home cooks,

17:11.562 --> 17:15.068
who are you gonna tether
next to Yachecia?

17:15.068 --> 17:18.274
This next home cook
has miles and miles
of personality,

17:18.274 --> 17:20.245
and I think paired
with Yachecia,

17:20.245 --> 17:23.652
two loud voices may not
sing together in harmony
in the kitchen,

17:23.652 --> 17:25.856
so I'm choosing Eboni.

17:25.856 --> 17:29.430
Eboni: <i>I'ma go into this,</i>
<i>you know, with a positive mind,</i>

17:29.430 --> 17:33.639
but Yachecia and I
both have extra‐aggressive
sister behavior.

17:33.639 --> 17:35.876
Lord help me,
'cause I'ma need it.

17:35.876 --> 17:38.348
Christina:
Now which one of these
four home cooks

17:38.348 --> 17:39.618
do you want to target?

17:39.618 --> 17:41.655
Jeff. As he continues
in the competition,

17:41.655 --> 17:43.993
he's gonna be more
difficult to deal with,

17:43.993 --> 17:45.362
so I'd like to deal
with him now.

17:45.362 --> 17:47.667
Interesting.
Who are you pairing
with Jeff?

17:47.667 --> 17:50.005
This particular home cook
has good execution,

17:50.005 --> 17:51.675
however is a little
soft‐spoken.

17:51.675 --> 17:53.712
I'm hoping
that Jeff's kind of roar

17:53.712 --> 17:55.683
will swallow up
this person's voice.

17:55.683 --> 17:57.987
Caitlin, I pair you
with Jeff.

17:57.987 --> 17:59.691
‐ Interesting.
‐ All right.

17:59.691 --> 18:02.329
So our final team
is Daniel and Gabriel.

18:02.329 --> 18:05.268
There we have it.
Please, all of you line up.

18:05.268 --> 18:07.339
Jason, your work is done.

18:07.339 --> 18:09.043
Head on up to the balcony.

18:09.043 --> 18:11.882
‐ Thank you very much.
‐ A bird's eye view,
young man.

18:11.882 --> 18:12.884
Have fun, all!

18:15.488 --> 18:17.492
Right, it's time
to show all of you

18:17.492 --> 18:18.662
what you'll be
making tonight

18:18.662 --> 18:22.503
to stay in this
incredible competition.

18:22.503 --> 18:25.041
Tonight you're gonna
be working with some
of the brightest

18:25.041 --> 18:27.145
and most flavorful foods
in the world.

18:27.145 --> 18:31.253
It's a food that is
extremely dear to my heart.

18:31.253 --> 18:34.026
You'll be making
a perfect platter

18:34.026 --> 18:36.063
of Mexican food.

18:36.063 --> 18:38.201
‐ Oh!
‐ ( squealing )

18:38.201 --> 18:39.203
‐ I can do Mexican.
‐ Ha ha ha!

18:39.203 --> 18:40.740
‐ Oh, yes!
‐ Aarón: Starting here,

18:40.740 --> 18:42.209
we have some homemade
tortilla chips

18:42.209 --> 18:44.012
with the wonderful
pico de gallo.

18:44.012 --> 18:46.183
Right next to that,
we have a spot prawn ceviche

18:46.183 --> 18:47.452
with avocado
and shaved radish.

18:47.452 --> 18:50.125
Over here,
lamb shoulder taquitos

18:50.125 --> 18:52.262
garnished with avocado crema,

18:52.262 --> 18:54.801
red snapper tacos,
with homemade tortillas
and cabbage slaw,

18:54.801 --> 18:57.774
chicken lollipops paired
with a peanut mole,

18:57.774 --> 18:59.944
and then to finish,
are churros.

18:59.944 --> 19:01.413
They're dusted
in cinnamon sugar,

19:01.413 --> 19:03.852
paired with this rich
Mexican chocolate sauce.

19:03.852 --> 19:06.390
Now, to spare yourself
from elimination,

19:06.390 --> 19:08.829
you're gonna
have to perfectly
replicate all of this.

19:11.333 --> 19:13.271
Oh, snap!

19:13.271 --> 19:16.210
Now, in a tag team,
you're not gonna be cooking

19:16.210 --> 19:17.379
together at the same time.

19:17.379 --> 19:19.016
One of you starts cooking,

19:19.016 --> 19:21.922
and your partner must stand
at the end of your station.

19:21.922 --> 19:25.128
When we shout "Switch!",
you will trade positions.

19:25.128 --> 19:26.932
Gordon:
Please, understand this.

19:26.932 --> 19:29.704
The person starting
this incredible challenge

19:29.704 --> 19:32.409
will not be
the same person finishing.

19:32.409 --> 19:33.545
So think about your strategy.

19:33.545 --> 19:35.583
You want to come
out the gate strong,

19:35.583 --> 19:38.722
but you want to finish
even stronger.

19:38.722 --> 19:41.260
Elimination is
on the line.

19:41.260 --> 19:42.763
Home cooks,
head to your stations.

19:44.968 --> 19:46.905
I'm psyched because I work
in Mexican fast food.

19:46.905 --> 19:48.642
It's what I do for a living,

19:48.642 --> 19:51.080
<i>so a lot of these techniques</i>
<i>aren't very foreign to me,</i>

19:51.080 --> 19:53.017
<i>and me and Daniel have worked</i>
<i>very well together</i>

19:53.017 --> 19:54.854
<i>in the team challenges.</i>
<i>So we're gonna come together</i>

19:54.854 --> 19:57.292
<i>and be able to put forth</i>
<i>an amazing platter.</i>

19:57.292 --> 19:59.864
Everything you need
has been placed on your
stations behind you.

19:59.864 --> 20:02.937
You have a selection
of incredible Latin
ingredients.

20:02.937 --> 20:05.776
Christina:
Will the person
finishing the challenge

20:05.776 --> 20:06.611
please step to
the end of the station?

20:11.855 --> 20:13.124
Gordon:
Now, is everybody ready

20:13.124 --> 20:14.694
for their toughest
challenge so far?

20:14.694 --> 20:17.667
‐ All: Yes, Chef!
‐ Your 60 minutes...

20:17.667 --> 20:19.403
starts...

20:19.403 --> 20:22.375
‐ ...now. Let's go.
‐ Gabriel: Go, go, go!

20:22.375 --> 20:24.246
Caitlin: All right, Jeff,
let's do this.

20:24.246 --> 20:25.481
Gabriel: Get our stock out,
get our mirepoix out,
and start cutting.

20:25.481 --> 20:26.885
Let's go!

20:26.885 --> 20:29.423
Perfect.
We'll get the lamb
going first.

20:29.423 --> 20:31.260
‐ Okay.
‐ Fly, Dino, fly.

20:31.260 --> 20:32.563
Eboni: Hurry up.
Dice it small.

20:32.563 --> 20:34.834
Quick, quick, quick,
quick, quick.

20:34.834 --> 20:37.205
Now, tag team challenge
is the most grueling challenge

20:37.205 --> 20:39.109
in the history
of this competition.

20:39.109 --> 20:40.713
Aarón, what's the most important
things to get done first?

20:40.713 --> 20:42.415
Aarón: First of all,
you gotta get
that lamb shoulder

20:42.415 --> 20:44.787
quickly marinated
and into a pressure cooker.

20:44.787 --> 20:46.791
‐ Searing the meat first,
though.
‐ Yep, exactly.

20:46.791 --> 20:49.229
‐ Whoo! Can you smell that?
‐ Eboni: Yes, I can smell it.

20:49.229 --> 20:50.899
Number two,
get your churro batter done.

20:50.899 --> 20:52.770
Mix, mix, mix.
Nice, Dino, nice.

20:52.770 --> 20:54.373
Aarón: That dough,
it needs to rest.

20:54.373 --> 20:55.876
‐ Brother, we gotta move.
‐ I got it, I got it.

20:55.876 --> 20:59.282
Then, French
those chicken lollipops.

20:59.282 --> 21:01.988
Good clean on them bones.
Boom, there you go.

21:01.988 --> 21:04.426
‐ Beautiful.
French those bones.
‐ Got it.

21:04.426 --> 21:06.664
And then start to get
your ceviche marinating.

21:06.664 --> 21:08.000
You can you get started
on that masa for me.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.604
Caitlin:
Looking awesome, Jeff.

21:09.604 --> 21:11.273
The last thing
that you should address

21:11.273 --> 21:13.512
is all the garnishes
and the pico de gallo.

21:13.512 --> 21:14.680
Get in there.
There we go.

21:14.680 --> 21:16.016
Don't forget
about the chicken, bro.

21:16.016 --> 21:17.018
We gotta start getting
that chicken wing
going, yeah?

21:17.018 --> 21:18.387
Gordon:
The key to success tonight

21:18.387 --> 21:19.857
‐ is in the communication.
‐ Yep.

21:19.857 --> 21:21.795
The minute there's silence,
it's game over.

21:21.795 --> 21:24.132
As soon as you get done,
I'm gonna start cutting
those vegetables, yeah?

21:24.132 --> 21:26.036
Daniel, you hear me?

21:26.036 --> 21:27.540
‐ Daniel!
‐ Huh?

21:27.540 --> 21:28.575
Set me up for whatever else
you need me to do, brother.

21:28.575 --> 21:31.981
30 seconds to go
till our first switch.

21:31.981 --> 21:34.086
I'm going to start
on those lollipop wings.

21:34.086 --> 21:35.254
I can't stand there silent.
What can I help you out with?

21:35.254 --> 21:36.991
Positive reinforcement
and watch my back.

21:36.991 --> 21:38.728
We're gonna start
making the tortillas.

21:38.728 --> 21:40.231
We gotta get that going
from a priority standpoint.

21:40.231 --> 21:42.135
‐ I'm all right with that.
‐ Knead that dough, baby.

21:42.135 --> 21:44.473
When I come in, we'll go ahead
and set that ganache up.

21:44.473 --> 21:45.776
Move it, baby.
You got this.

21:45.776 --> 21:48.481
‐ Stand by.
‐ Judges: Five, four,

21:48.481 --> 21:50.318
‐ three, two...
‐ Get ready!

21:50.318 --> 21:52.523
‐ ...one. Switch!
‐ Go!

21:52.523 --> 21:54.126
‐ You got it! You got it!
‐ We're switching!

21:54.126 --> 21:57.499
‐ All right, babes.
‐ ( squeals, laughs )

21:57.499 --> 21:59.302
Come on, come on!
Come on, Eboni! Come on!

21:59.302 --> 22:00.939
How do we build those?
Talk me through that.

22:00.939 --> 22:02.442
‐ Uh...
‐ Lift the voice.

22:02.442 --> 22:03.879
What do I need to be
doing right now?
Talk to me.

22:03.879 --> 22:06.216
The team
I'm most worried about
is Daniel and Gabriel.

22:06.216 --> 22:07.887
Christina:
Daniel is completely lost.

22:07.887 --> 22:10.993
‐ He's just quiet.
‐ All right, just keep going.

22:10.993 --> 22:12.630
You know, Daniel,
he looks like he's

22:12.630 --> 22:14.600
inside of his own head
lollygagging.

22:14.600 --> 22:15.836
Daniel, Daniel.
Focus on us. Focus on us.

22:15.836 --> 22:17.071
Yeah, keep going.
Keep going. The next thing‐‐

22:17.071 --> 22:18.575
Hey, what do I need
to do right now?

22:18.575 --> 22:19.911
<i>And it's infuriating,</i>

22:19.911 --> 22:21.480
<i>because I'm realizing</i>
<i>that our team</i>

22:21.480 --> 22:22.950
is definitely falling way,
way behind.

22:22.950 --> 22:24.854
Taking the lead.
Lead me! Let's go!

22:24.854 --> 22:26.089
Daniel:
You got the churros going.

22:26.089 --> 22:27.425
Just keep cleaning up
those wings.

22:27.425 --> 22:30.131
Right. So why are we cooking
the churros now?

22:30.131 --> 22:31.601
We just want to get them
out of the way.

22:31.601 --> 22:33.538
‐ We don't want them to‐‐
‐ What happens to a churro

22:33.538 --> 22:35.041
when it's cooked
with 48 minutes to go?

22:36.945 --> 22:39.216
Young man, you work in
a fast food Mexican restaurant.

22:39.216 --> 22:42.222
‐ What happens to them?
‐ I don't work
with churros, Chef.

22:42.222 --> 22:44.125
‐ Gordon: They go dry!
‐ Yes, Chef.

22:44.125 --> 22:46.296
So we've got
no chicken cooked,
no lamb cooked.

22:46.296 --> 22:48.969
Have we made the taco paste?
The tortilla shell?

22:48.969 --> 22:50.371
No, Chef,
I'm doing that next.

22:50.371 --> 22:51.908
After this,
I'm doing that next, Chef.

22:51.908 --> 22:53.912
Hold on a minute.
So we're cooking churros,

22:53.912 --> 22:55.481
‐ and we haven't made
the taco shells?
‐ No, Chef.

22:55.481 --> 22:56.684
So why are
we cooking them then?

22:56.684 --> 22:58.387
Because we messed up, Chef!

22:58.387 --> 23:01.059
Come on, guys!
What's going on with you two?

23:01.059 --> 23:03.030
‐ We'll adjust, Chef.
‐ Wake up, then!

23:12.348 --> 23:14.486
Look at me, both.
So we're cooking churros

23:14.486 --> 23:16.189
‐ and we haven't made
the taco shells?
‐ No, Chef.

23:16.189 --> 23:17.358
So why are
we cooking them, then?

23:17.358 --> 23:19.062
Because we messed up, Chef.

23:19.062 --> 23:21.868
Come on, guys.
What's going on with you two?

23:21.868 --> 23:23.972
‐ We'll adjust, Chef.
‐ Wake up, then!

23:23.972 --> 23:26.209
‐ Both: Yes, Chef!
‐ Man!

23:26.209 --> 23:28.915
‐ It's all right.
‐ Daniel, he's not talking,
he's not being vocal.

23:28.915 --> 23:30.852
‐ What do you want to do
with these churros now?
‐ Pull them out for now.

23:30.852 --> 23:32.923
I don't want to hear
one silent moment out
of you, Daniel!

23:32.923 --> 23:35.027
Okay. I kind of
screwed you up there.
That was my fault.

23:35.027 --> 23:37.065
A switch just flips
in my mind, and it says,

23:37.065 --> 23:39.169
<i>"You have to light</i>
<i>the fire under him</i>
<i>or you're done."</i>

23:39.169 --> 23:40.572
And I'm not gonna be
the one going home.

23:40.572 --> 23:42.910
‐ Let's go!
‐ All right, get started
on that pate a choux.

23:42.910 --> 23:45.749
Gordon:
We've got two minutes
to go until your next switch.

23:45.749 --> 23:47.786
‐ Guys, let's go!
‐ You've got to be
very careful.

23:47.786 --> 23:49.757
‐ Don't cut yourself.
‐ I will not cut myself.

23:49.757 --> 23:51.928
They're very small tacos.
Smaller than that.

23:51.928 --> 23:54.065
‐ I don't think
it's gonna be enough.
‐ Not too big.

23:54.065 --> 23:55.535
I don't think Eboni's
very good at taking direction.

23:55.535 --> 23:57.105
Here's a big worry‐‐
Eboni and Yachecia,

23:57.105 --> 23:59.209
they're two strong
individuals.

23:59.209 --> 24:00.144
I don't know if they'll
come together as a team.

24:00.144 --> 24:02.215
‐ That's enough!
‐ Oh! ( bleep )

24:02.215 --> 24:03.551
‐ Careful!
‐ That could be a disaster.

24:03.551 --> 24:05.822
Gordon:
Thirty seconds
before we switch!

24:05.822 --> 24:07.526
‐ Mole and chicken are next.
‐ Got it!

24:07.526 --> 24:08.728
Dino:
Cate, what am I working on
when I get back?

24:08.728 --> 24:11.333
Focus on the flautas,
the chicken.

24:11.333 --> 24:13.170
Pate a choux is almost done.
I'm gonna throw it in
the mix in here shortly.

24:13.170 --> 24:14.707
‐ Yep!
‐ Let's go, guys.

24:14.707 --> 24:16.911
Judges:
Five, four, three,

24:16.911 --> 24:19.382
two, one, switch!

24:19.382 --> 24:21.253
‐ Come on, brother, come on.
‐ I got you. I got you.

24:21.253 --> 24:22.790
‐ Come on, come on.
‐ Meat's good to go.

24:22.790 --> 24:24.292
‐ All right.
‐ Come on, man.

24:24.292 --> 24:26.764
‐ I'm moving, I'm moving.
‐ Woo! Awesome, Jeff.

24:26.764 --> 24:27.800
Drop the eggs, it's cool.

24:27.800 --> 24:29.537
It should be good now.
Add it.

24:29.537 --> 24:31.273
‐ Wait for the‐‐ huh?
‐ Cutting the tomato, baby.

24:31.273 --> 24:32.910
Needs to be super
finely sliced.

24:32.910 --> 24:34.914
‐ I know how to small dice.
‐ Go, go, go.

24:34.914 --> 24:36.884
Christina:
I'm worried about
Cate and Dino.

24:36.884 --> 24:38.621
Cate is so
controlling of Dino.

24:38.621 --> 24:41.126
There's enough tomato.
We have so much to do.

24:41.126 --> 24:42.328
I know, but I gotta
get it perfect.

24:42.328 --> 24:44.165
But Dino
can't take direction.

24:44.165 --> 24:45.635
‐ Is it cooked?
‐ Not yet.

24:45.635 --> 24:46.771
Caitlin:
I almost wonder
if we should

24:46.771 --> 24:48.073
get the chips done
and out of the way.

24:48.073 --> 24:49.242
Jeff:
No, that's gonna take
literally nothing.

24:49.242 --> 24:51.179
I make tortilla chips
all the time.

24:51.179 --> 24:53.116
‐ Are you sure?
‐ We don't need that right now.

24:53.116 --> 24:55.956
‐ Look at how
controlling Jeff is.
‐ Um...

24:55.956 --> 24:57.526
Yeah, but Caitlin's
allowing it to happen, guys.

24:57.526 --> 25:00.164
‐ I'm sorry.
‐ Whoo!

25:00.164 --> 25:02.134
‐ Is that us burning?
‐ We ain't burning. We good.

25:02.134 --> 25:04.940
‐ Oh!
‐ 30 seconds till
your next switch!

25:04.940 --> 25:06.209
What are you thinking?
What am I doing after this?

25:06.209 --> 25:07.613
I think you should start
on the chicken wings after this.

25:07.613 --> 25:09.550
How do you feel about
deveining the prawns

25:09.550 --> 25:10.652
and getting those
ready for me?

25:10.652 --> 25:12.288
Caitlin:
I'm unfamiliar with prawns.

25:12.288 --> 25:13.825
How do you feel
about getting tortillas
pressed then?

25:13.825 --> 25:18.133
‐ Um, I can fry the churros.
‐ Let's do it, then.

25:18.133 --> 25:19.637
Move the tortilla.
Throw the old one away.

25:19.637 --> 25:21.239
Jeez, Cate, let me do this
( bleep ), all right?

25:21.239 --> 25:25.114
‐ Get ready!
‐ Three, two, one, switch.

25:25.114 --> 25:26.283
‐ Gordon: Let's go!
‐ Go, go!

25:26.283 --> 25:27.586
You got this.

25:27.586 --> 25:29.322
‐ Get the onions going.
‐ For the pico de gallo?

25:29.322 --> 25:31.961
‐ ( Bleep ).
I can do this part.
‐ Damn, we so behind.

25:31.961 --> 25:34.299
‐ We gotta make the crema.
‐ You gonna have to make that.

25:34.299 --> 25:36.036
I got it.
I'm just going down
the checklist.

25:36.036 --> 25:38.106
‐ Don't get frustrated, Eboni.
‐ Gordon: Right.

25:38.106 --> 25:40.177
‐ How long for the lamb?
‐ Cate: Three minutes.

25:40.177 --> 25:42.048
‐ You've got
the taco shells underway?
‐ Yep.

25:42.048 --> 25:43.785
‐ Are you in control?
‐ She knows what she's doing,

25:43.785 --> 25:45.220
so I really just
have to encourage her.

25:45.220 --> 25:48.561
Somebody is going home.
Make sure it's not you.

25:48.561 --> 25:51.801
So you need to step up
and make sure you're over
every little thing she does,

25:51.801 --> 25:53.303
so you make these
decisions together.

25:53.303 --> 25:54.305
‐ Definitely, Chef.
‐ This is crucial.

25:54.305 --> 25:56.176
Standing here is crucial.
Let's go.

25:56.176 --> 25:58.046
‐ Check the meat.
You're doing good.
‐ Yep.

25:58.046 --> 26:00.084
If you can get that cucumber
chopped up for me‐‐

26:00.084 --> 26:03.423
‐ the crema, the fish,
and the, uh, slaw.
‐ Oh, my gosh.

26:03.423 --> 26:05.996
‐ This is too much.
‐ 15 seconds to switch!

26:05.996 --> 26:07.465
What am I doing
when I get back in there?

26:07.465 --> 26:09.202
‐ Start filling the taquitos.
‐ Okay.

26:09.202 --> 26:13.978
‐ Get the tortillas going.
‐ Three, two, one, switch!

26:13.978 --> 26:15.314
‐ Okay, let's go.
‐ Boom.

26:15.314 --> 26:16.717
‐ Come on, come on.
‐ I got you.

26:16.717 --> 26:17.819
It's good.
Those are good.

26:17.819 --> 26:19.355
Gordon:
20 minutes remaining.

26:19.355 --> 26:20.892
Keep Frenching, keep Frenching.
Make sure it's clean.

26:20.892 --> 26:23.063
‐ That bone needs
to be clean.
‐ Yep!

26:23.063 --> 26:25.167
All right, Caitlin,
what else do you have
left to do?

26:25.167 --> 26:27.839
We have to make the fish
for the fish tacos.

26:27.839 --> 26:29.843
We have to fry up
our tortilla chips.

26:29.843 --> 26:32.516
Right, you've gotta make sure
you tell your partner

26:32.516 --> 26:34.152
what the next steps are.
Communicate, okay?

26:34.152 --> 26:36.089
‐ Yes, Chef.
‐ Good luck.

26:36.089 --> 26:37.893
‐ Thank you, Chef.
‐ You tell me what
I'm gonna have to do next.

26:37.893 --> 26:39.897
What do you think?
What do you think?
Tell me, tell me, tell me.

26:39.897 --> 26:42.936
For‐‐ wait, what?
I'll let it be your call.

26:42.936 --> 26:44.506
‐ You need to do
your‐‐ the shells!
‐ Ceviche!

26:44.506 --> 26:46.544
No, skip the ceviche.
We gotta catch up.

26:46.544 --> 26:48.213
I gotta finish
the ceviche, though.

26:48.213 --> 26:50.184
Leave that ceviche alone.
That can wait till last.

26:50.184 --> 26:52.221
‐ Do the shells.
‐ Eboni, how are you guys
working as a team?

26:52.221 --> 26:54.760
Because Jason put you guys
together thinking you were
gonna completely clash.

26:54.760 --> 26:56.096
Actually, we're butting heads.

26:56.096 --> 26:57.566
She want to keep on
going back to the ceviche,

26:57.566 --> 26:59.202
though I'm telling her no.

26:59.202 --> 27:01.741
Whatever she doesn't
get done right now
is on your shoulders.

27:01.741 --> 27:04.680
‐ Exactly, Chef.
‐ Keep talking. I want
to hear your voice. Let's go!

27:04.680 --> 27:07.719
All right, so do the shells
and then come back to
the ceviche, okay?

27:07.719 --> 27:09.355
‐ Everything's on.
‐ ( sighs )

27:09.355 --> 27:10.692
Gabriel:
Get 'em double toothpicked,
get 'em in the fryer.

27:10.692 --> 27:12.194
Let's not go home!
Come on!

27:12.194 --> 27:14.933
Gabriel has stepped up
and is now controlling Daniel.

27:14.933 --> 27:16.002
Christina:
He is guiding Daniel,

27:16.002 --> 27:17.873
and Daniel knows
how to take direction.

27:17.873 --> 27:19.943
Roll it super tight.
Perfect, Dino.

27:19.943 --> 27:22.248
Let's get that avocado crema
going now, D.

27:22.248 --> 27:23.718
Okay.

27:23.718 --> 27:26.089
Now, Cate is so vocal
and Dino's moving fast.

27:26.089 --> 27:28.694
Throw it in the thing!
Throw it in the thing! Good.

27:28.694 --> 27:31.065
‐ And those two are working
in tandem brilliantly.
‐ Nice, Dino!

27:31.065 --> 27:34.105
Gordon:
30 seconds to go
for your last switch!

27:34.105 --> 27:35.975
I think they need
to go back in!

27:35.975 --> 27:38.581
‐ But it's gotta go
in the sugar!
‐ You can't do that!

27:38.581 --> 27:41.654
‐ How long we want 'em?
‐ About like that, man.
Let's go!

27:41.654 --> 27:44.392
Maybe don't press it so hard.

27:44.392 --> 27:46.462
We don't need that.
I will pay for that, I swear.

27:46.462 --> 27:48.400
‐ Keep going, keep going.
‐ Caitlin: Get those
aromatics in.

27:48.400 --> 27:49.837
You need to season that again
for the vegetables.

27:49.837 --> 27:52.274
I am going to.
I know what we have to do.

27:52.274 --> 27:53.611
We got to get
this salsa made.

27:53.611 --> 27:54.980
‐ What sauce?
‐ The salsa.

27:54.980 --> 27:56.249
‐ Ugh!
‐ Gordon: This is it.

27:56.249 --> 27:59.590
Judges:
Three, two, one, switch!

27:59.590 --> 28:01.426
‐ Let's go!
‐ All right, go, go!

28:01.426 --> 28:02.963
Daggone it!
( bleep )

28:02.963 --> 28:05.400
This is your last chance
to make a difference
to your team.

28:05.400 --> 28:07.539
Fish is right there in the sink.
Watch out for it, all right?

28:07.539 --> 28:10.143
‐ Thanks, man.
‐ Does it need a flip?
Does it need a flip?

28:10.143 --> 28:12.114
The last five minutes
is all assembly.

28:12.114 --> 28:13.584
What are we missing?
Are we missing anything?

28:13.584 --> 28:15.053
Put those beautiful churros
on the plate.

28:15.053 --> 28:16.624
‐ Yeah, they not done.
‐ They're done.

28:16.624 --> 28:17.993
They don't got
the sugar coating.

28:17.993 --> 28:20.598
I know, but we gotta get
the taquitos rolled up.

28:20.598 --> 28:22.134
‐ Taquitos gotta roll, mama.
‐ How long?

28:22.134 --> 28:23.838
Big trouble right now,
obviously, is Eboni
and Yachecia.

28:23.838 --> 28:26.242
They are nowhere near
on the same page.

28:26.242 --> 28:28.113
I don't know
if they're gonna make it.

28:28.113 --> 28:28.948
Jeff:
Give it a nice little stir
until they're chocolate.

28:28.948 --> 28:31.452
We need another
tortilla there.

28:31.452 --> 28:34.626
‐ Get the churros fried.
‐ Jeff, I can only think
one step ahead.

28:34.626 --> 28:36.262
Caitlin and Jeff
are still making tortillas.

28:36.262 --> 28:37.666
Gordon:
Oh, my Lord. Unbelievable.

28:37.666 --> 28:39.536
Three minutes to go!

28:39.536 --> 28:41.439
‐ Plate!
‐ Take the chicken out
and go ahead and plate it!

28:41.439 --> 28:43.143
It ain't even gotta be pretty.
Let's go.

28:43.143 --> 28:45.013
Chicken in the sauce.
Get some of that sauce
in there, too.

28:45.013 --> 28:46.650
‐ I got you.
‐ Daniel: Ceviche plate it!

28:46.650 --> 28:48.788
‐ I'm plating.
‐ Good!

28:48.788 --> 28:51.694
‐ Gotta work fast.
‐ Thin slices, thin slices!
That's enough, that's enough.

28:51.694 --> 28:53.564
‐ Come on, Eboni!
‐ I don't know how
these shells gonna work.

28:53.564 --> 28:56.169
Get 'em in there.
Serve what we got.
That's it!

28:56.169 --> 28:58.340
One minute to go!

28:58.340 --> 29:00.077
Christina:
Put the food on the plate!

29:00.077 --> 29:01.714
No, no, you
got a little bit
of season to it.

29:01.714 --> 29:03.483
Jeff, we gotta
prioritize here, buddy.

29:03.483 --> 29:05.688
‐ Take the toothpicks out!
Take the toothpicks out!
‐ I will.

29:05.688 --> 29:08.493
‐ Ooh, Cate!
‐ Dino: Smash the nuts, baby.
Smash the nuts.

29:08.493 --> 29:10.297
Talk to me.
Look for my tortillas.

29:10.297 --> 29:11.967
‐ Gabriel, come on!
‐ Come on!

29:11.967 --> 29:13.938
‐ Crema on the taquitos!
‐ Oh, damn it!

29:13.938 --> 29:15.675
Get the rolls out!

29:15.675 --> 29:17.846
‐ Guys, we have got to move.
‐ We're doing great, Dan!

29:17.846 --> 29:19.215
‐ Christina: Let's go!
‐ Judges: Ten,

29:19.215 --> 29:20.651
‐ Come on!
‐ nine...

29:20.651 --> 29:21.954
‐ Finish strong.
Finish strong with it!
‐ eight...

29:21.954 --> 29:22.989
‐ Beautiful! Way to go, Gabe!
‐ seven, six...

29:22.989 --> 29:24.993
‐ That goes on top.
‐ five, four...

29:24.993 --> 29:26.295
‐ Come on, come on, come on.
‐ three...

29:26.295 --> 29:27.532
‐ Let's go, let's go!
‐ two....

29:27.532 --> 29:29.503
‐ one, stop!
‐ Hands up!

29:29.503 --> 29:31.172
‐ Hands in the air!
‐ Good job.

29:31.172 --> 29:32.341
Whoo!

29:38.821 --> 29:42.161
Time is up.
Your tag team
challenge is over.

29:42.161 --> 29:43.764
Pretty intense out there.

29:43.764 --> 29:47.004
Now it's time to taste
your Mexican platters.

29:47.004 --> 29:49.576
Please come up,
Cate and Dino.

29:49.576 --> 29:51.613
‐ I got it. Yeah.
‐ Really?

29:51.613 --> 29:53.249
I think in
a tag team challenge,

29:53.249 --> 29:56.590
<i>the most important thing</i>
<i>is communication,</i>

29:56.590 --> 29:59.763
<i>And Dino and I,</i>
<i>we just worked together,</i>

29:59.763 --> 30:03.236
<i>and we communicated,</i>
<i>and we produced a beautiful</i>
<i>Mexican platter.</i>

30:03.236 --> 30:05.407
Aarón:
How did you guys feel it went,
those 60 minutes?

30:05.407 --> 30:08.747
There was a lot to do
and we were not perfect,

30:08.747 --> 30:10.117
but we worked really well
with each other.

30:10.117 --> 30:12.655
‐ We communicated
the whole entire time.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

30:12.655 --> 30:15.260
Well, first of all,

30:15.260 --> 30:18.968
you did achieve
a great tortilla.

30:18.968 --> 30:21.907
You browned it beautifully
and it's not breaking.

30:21.907 --> 30:24.679
‐ Who did what?
‐ Dino did the tortilla shells

30:24.679 --> 30:28.821
and I did the fish tacos,
the filing.

30:28.821 --> 30:30.758
The fish is cooked right.
It's well‐seasoned.

30:30.758 --> 30:33.096
This just needs
some lime juice,

30:33.096 --> 30:34.666
something to kind
of bring it together,

30:34.666 --> 30:35.935
‐ but the tortilla's delicious.
‐ Thank you.

30:35.935 --> 30:38.173
The lamb taquito‐‐
who made these?

30:38.173 --> 30:41.379
We tag‐teamed the lamb
and Dino did the flautas.

30:43.049 --> 30:44.819
The construction of it,
they're kind of broken up,

30:44.819 --> 30:47.391
but the actual meat
is really well‐flavored.

30:47.391 --> 30:49.563
And then these drumettes,
how did you guys cook those?

30:49.563 --> 30:51.567
We seasoned 'em, fried 'em,

30:51.567 --> 30:54.004
and then braised 'em
in the mole.

30:55.841 --> 30:57.812
The chicken mole pops, spot on.
I mean, textbook.

30:57.812 --> 31:01.252
The ceviche...

31:01.252 --> 31:03.256
it's so well‐balanced.

31:03.256 --> 31:04.124
It's vibrant, it's fresh.

31:04.124 --> 31:05.628
Both: Thank you.

31:05.628 --> 31:07.699
Churros,
the batter is airy

31:07.699 --> 31:09.301
and it's just cooked
to perfection.

31:09.301 --> 31:13.176
And then over here,
you have the pico de gallo.

31:13.176 --> 31:16.048
That needs salt,
but the acid's there.

31:16.048 --> 31:18.687
Look, this was not easy.
Really great work, guys.

31:18.687 --> 31:20.023
You made Mexico proud.

31:20.023 --> 31:21.960
‐ Nice job, baby.
‐ Thank you.

31:21.960 --> 31:23.697
Thank you!

31:23.697 --> 31:24.532
Dino:
<i>I'm on Cloud 10 right now.</i>

31:24.532 --> 31:26.670
Jason made a huge mistake.

31:26.670 --> 31:29.341
He thought he was setting up
a failed group,

31:29.341 --> 31:30.343
<i>but we killed it.</i>

31:30.343 --> 31:32.849
<i>So proud of our team.</i>

31:32.849 --> 31:35.487
Jeff and Caitlin,
please make your way
down here.

31:35.487 --> 31:37.190
‐ Got it?
‐ Got it.

31:37.190 --> 31:38.661
I took a leading role

31:38.661 --> 31:40.698
with this entire
tag team challenge

31:40.698 --> 31:43.504
<i>because Caitlin didn't bring</i>
<i>a lot to the table.</i>

31:43.504 --> 31:46.108
<i>We might not have gotten</i>
<i>the small details,</i>

31:46.108 --> 31:49.916
<i>but at least we got</i>
<i>everything on the plate.</i>

31:49.916 --> 31:53.423
Jeff and Caitlin,
you had the three best pair
of eyes on both of you tonight,

31:53.423 --> 31:57.064
and we were frustrated
with the fact that Jeff
was overbearing.

31:57.064 --> 31:59.368
And you, Caitlin,
you weren't in
this game tonight

31:59.368 --> 32:01.105
and it was controlled
all by Jeff.

32:01.105 --> 32:03.577
I felt like Jeff
was talking me through things

32:03.577 --> 32:05.213
that were four or five
steps down the road,

32:05.213 --> 32:08.186
and that just made it
harder for me to focus
on the task at hand.

32:08.186 --> 32:09.522
How would you rate
this platter out of 10?

32:09.522 --> 32:11.860
‐ A three or a four.
‐ Jeff: I beg to differ.

32:11.860 --> 32:13.029
I would have actually gone
a little bit higher.

32:13.029 --> 32:14.566
I would've gone a seven
because everything is there.

32:16.435 --> 32:17.672
Because everything is there,

32:17.672 --> 32:20.911
it doesn't mean
that this is on a seven.

32:20.911 --> 32:23.416
Come on, guys.
I am not gonna accept that.

32:23.416 --> 32:26.055
‐ Okay.
‐ Nowhere near it.

32:26.055 --> 32:29.729
( bleep )
Let's go to the churros.

32:29.729 --> 32:31.065
Seven, it's not.
Let's get that right.

32:31.065 --> 32:33.035
‐ Who put them in the fryer?
‐ I did, Chef.

32:33.035 --> 32:36.242
If I stick all four together,
I may get one decent churro.

32:36.242 --> 32:38.246
Who shredded the lamb?

32:38.246 --> 32:41.118
‐ Caitlin: I did, Chef.
‐ It's like the lowest
form of dog food.

32:41.118 --> 32:42.487
It's just chunks.

32:42.487 --> 32:43.791
I was working
as fast as I can

32:43.791 --> 32:45.460
to shred it
with two forks and...

32:45.460 --> 32:46.663
( spits )

32:46.663 --> 32:48.332
Shocking.

32:49.636 --> 32:51.506
‐ Who cooked the chicken?
‐ I did.

32:51.506 --> 32:52.508
And how long
was that cooked for?

32:52.508 --> 32:54.278
Five minutes
into the fryer.

32:54.278 --> 32:57.585
My gran's flip flops
have more ( bleep ) texture.

32:57.585 --> 32:59.956
‐ Ceviche, who did that?
‐ I did.

32:59.956 --> 33:02.728
‐ The actual flavor
is delicious.
‐ Thank you.

33:02.728 --> 33:04.899
Unfortunately,
the tray is a disaster.

33:04.899 --> 33:07.270
Chicken's overcooked,
churros are embarrassing.

33:07.270 --> 33:10.978
What can I salvage?
I love the china that you
served the ceviche on.

33:10.978 --> 33:12.147
Thank you.

33:12.147 --> 33:13.817
I am just kicking myself

33:13.817 --> 33:16.455
<i>for letting Jeff</i>
<i>take control of our dish.</i>

33:16.455 --> 33:17.592
I know I'm a better
cook than that,

33:17.592 --> 33:19.629
<i>so I'm hoping</i>
<i>the judges can see</i>

33:19.629 --> 33:21.666
<i>it's not representative</i>
<i>of how much I've learned</i>

33:21.666 --> 33:24.839
<i>and how far I've come.</i>

33:24.839 --> 33:26.977
Next up, please,
Daniel and Gabriel.

33:26.977 --> 33:28.580
Here we go.

33:28.580 --> 33:31.620
Me and Gabriel,
we had some mistakes
at the beginning,

33:31.620 --> 33:33.657
<i>but we both</i>
<i>found our stride,</i>

33:33.657 --> 33:37.097
<i>and just hoping we did enough</i>
<i>to be safe from elimination.</i>

33:37.097 --> 33:39.536
Daniel, Gabriel,
what was your team
dynamic like?

33:39.536 --> 33:41.606
We got off
to a patchy start,

33:41.606 --> 33:43.276
but I feel like
we bounced back,

33:43.276 --> 33:44.846
we really started
communicating,

33:44.846 --> 33:46.983
and we started working as, you
know, one cook.

33:46.983 --> 33:51.325
This platter
is a testament to that.

33:51.325 --> 33:53.462
It's a good‐looking
platter, guys.

33:53.462 --> 33:55.133
‐ Thank you.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

33:55.133 --> 33:58.507
Let's talk first
about these taquitos.
Who did what?

33:58.507 --> 34:00.376
I got the meat in,
he started the shred.

34:00.376 --> 34:03.617
We both had a hand
in different stages
of the process.

34:05.621 --> 34:08.192
That lamb's delicious.
It's tender.

34:08.192 --> 34:10.430
‐ Could've had a bit more
of an even fry there.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

34:10.430 --> 34:11.432
Let's talk
about this chicken.

34:11.432 --> 34:12.969
That was a joint effort.

34:12.969 --> 34:16.843
Danny started the Frenching on
the leg, and I finished it.

34:16.843 --> 34:18.547
‐ It's tasty.
‐ Both: Thank you, Chef.

34:18.547 --> 34:20.049
Fish tacos‐‐
who made the tortillas?

34:20.049 --> 34:22.053
That would be Gabe,
and I cooked the fish.

34:22.053 --> 34:25.661
The tortillas are beautiful.
They're not split underneath.

34:25.661 --> 34:28.299
You can tell
they're perfectly sized.
Very thoughtful.

34:29.702 --> 34:32.240
‐ It's flavorful.
‐ Both: Thank you, Chef.

34:32.240 --> 34:34.646
‐ Who made the ceviche?
‐ Gabriel: That was
a joint effort.

34:34.646 --> 34:37.852
Great seasoning,
tender, fresh pieces
of that spot prawn.

34:37.852 --> 34:41.258
I'm impressed
with that ceviche.
Chips not as great.

34:41.258 --> 34:43.429
We've got some
different colors.

34:43.429 --> 34:44.732
This salsa...

34:47.070 --> 34:48.740
It's well‐seasoned.
It's got heat.

34:48.740 --> 34:50.744
It's got freshness.
It's got that brightness.

34:50.744 --> 34:51.746
And then let's
look at these churros.

34:54.284 --> 34:56.221
Great. Beautiful
pate a choux batter.

34:56.221 --> 34:59.094
You can see those beautiful
eggy air holes in there.

34:59.094 --> 35:01.733
I was impressed with the way
that you guys worked together.

35:01.733 --> 35:03.202
it's the best‐looking platter
out there tonight.

35:03.202 --> 35:05.373
‐ Really nice job.
‐ Both: Thank you, Chef.

35:05.373 --> 35:06.509
Cate:
Nice job, you guys.

35:08.312 --> 35:09.515
Good job, man.
You definitely stepped up.

35:09.515 --> 35:11.519
Yachecia and Eboni, please.

35:11.519 --> 35:15.259
‐ Careful.
‐ Yachecia and I on a team
together was difficult.

35:15.259 --> 35:16.495
<i>And, to me,</i>
<i>she was no help.</i>

35:16.495 --> 35:17.330
<i>I had to get</i>
<i>the whole platter done</i>

35:17.330 --> 35:18.834
<i>in the last five minutes.</i>

35:18.834 --> 35:20.671
And now we got
the worst platter.

35:20.671 --> 35:22.908
<i>I could throw this</i>
<i>on the floor right now,</i>

35:22.908 --> 35:24.946
<i>walk up there bare‐handed,</i>
<i>and be content.</i>

35:24.946 --> 35:27.283
<i>It's better than serving them</i>
<i>dog crap.</i>

35:27.283 --> 35:30.089
Okay, truthfully...

35:30.089 --> 35:33.129
what a mess.

35:33.129 --> 35:35.133
‐ What happened, Yachecia?
‐ I'm not really sure.

35:35.133 --> 35:37.605
I think multi‐tasking
was a big issue,

35:37.605 --> 35:39.307
but I thought we were
communicating.

35:39.307 --> 35:41.546
Honestly, this plate
really look like this

35:41.546 --> 35:43.550
because when it came down to
the last five minutes,

35:43.550 --> 35:45.988
I had to do half
the tray by myself.

35:45.988 --> 35:46.823
Absolutely not.

35:49.094 --> 35:51.733
I braised the lamb.
I Frenched the chicken
and cooked it.

35:51.733 --> 35:53.269
‐ You didn't cook the chicken.
‐ I started the pate a choux‐‐

35:53.269 --> 35:54.839
I did cook the chicken.

35:54.839 --> 35:56.475
And the pate a choux?
I started it for her.

35:56.475 --> 35:58.914
No, I started the pate a choux.
I started it and we tagged it.

35:58.914 --> 36:01.786
It was back and forth,
but she like the new Jeff.

36:01.786 --> 36:03.222
Oh, wow.

36:03.222 --> 36:04.792
She not gonna
admit her mistakes
because she cooks so great.

36:04.792 --> 36:05.961
I don't have a problem
admitting my mistakes.

36:05.961 --> 36:08.733
I'm just telling the truth.
What's on the plate.

36:08.733 --> 36:09.569
I'm telling the truth.
I think we did it together.

36:17.618 --> 36:18.753
She not gonna
admit her mistakes
because she cooks so great.

36:18.753 --> 36:20.423
I don't have a problem
admitting my mistakes.

36:20.423 --> 36:22.995
I'm just telling the truth.
What's on the plate.

36:22.995 --> 36:25.601
I'm telling the truth.
I think we did it together.

36:25.601 --> 36:27.605
And I don't think
that I didn't do my part.
I did my part.

36:27.605 --> 36:30.409
Honestly, I'd never seen
two individuals

36:30.409 --> 36:31.813
so distant from each other.

36:31.813 --> 36:33.583
There was no synergy,
no harmony,

36:33.583 --> 36:36.522
but more importantly,
you ignored each other.

36:36.522 --> 36:39.528
It was like two
individuals that wouldn't
set their egos aside

36:39.528 --> 36:41.164
to get each other
over the line.

36:41.164 --> 36:43.469
And then this.

36:43.469 --> 36:45.707
Look at that.

36:45.707 --> 36:48.012
I don't know what to say.

36:48.012 --> 36:51.552
‐ And what is this?
‐ Eboni: No chips and salsa.

36:51.552 --> 36:53.723
Is it a magic trick?

36:53.723 --> 36:55.861
Shake the bag upside down,
I'm sure there's gonna be
a white rabbit.

36:55.861 --> 36:58.499
And what is that?

36:58.499 --> 37:01.004
I mean, seriously,
I've seen more
appetizing diapers.

37:01.004 --> 37:02.574
I'm sure.

37:02.574 --> 37:03.743
Would you just do me
a little favor?

37:03.743 --> 37:05.580
Say a prayer before
I tuck into this ( bleep )?

37:05.580 --> 37:07.116
Because I have
to taste this now.

37:10.991 --> 37:11.993
( spits )

37:11.993 --> 37:14.865
Thank you for my sick bag.

37:14.865 --> 37:15.801
Ugh, disgusting.

37:18.272 --> 37:19.508
What's the positives?

37:19.508 --> 37:21.679
The chicken,
it looks appetizing.

37:21.679 --> 37:25.119
And the churros
actually taste quite nice.

37:25.119 --> 37:26.723
I see what you've both done
in this competition,

37:26.723 --> 37:28.025
and you've had
moments of brilliance.

37:28.025 --> 37:29.662
But tonight,
you didn't listen
to each other,

37:29.662 --> 37:32.801
and I think Jason
has just hit a direct hit

37:32.801 --> 37:34.839
with both of you
with one foot out the door.

37:34.839 --> 37:37.878
Good work, Jason.

37:37.878 --> 37:42.387
I really feel bad
that we did not work as well
together as we should have.

37:42.387 --> 37:45.694
I think we allowed the pressure
to get the best of us.

37:49.401 --> 37:50.236
Please, everyone,
come down to the front.

37:52.574 --> 37:54.712
Jason:
<i>At this point in the game,</i>
<i>with nine of us left,</i>

37:54.712 --> 37:56.682
<i>it's every man for himself.</i>

37:56.682 --> 37:59.588
So I'm hoping to get rid of one
of my strongest competitors.

37:59.588 --> 38:01.726
That was a very
difficult challenge.

38:01.726 --> 38:04.532
One of you will be
going home tonight,

38:04.532 --> 38:06.969
but one team
put together a platter

38:06.969 --> 38:09.542
that I would be honored
to put on any one of
my restaurant menus.

38:09.542 --> 38:11.044
And that would be...

38:14.552 --> 38:15.554
Cate and Dino.

38:15.554 --> 38:18.492
Nice job, baby.

38:18.492 --> 38:20.096
‐ Head up to the balcony.
‐ Thank you.

38:20.096 --> 38:21.164
Congratulations, guys.
Nice job.

38:21.164 --> 38:24.772
Best team of the night, baby.
Ow, yes!

38:24.772 --> 38:26.876
<i>For me and Cate,</i>
<i>this was definitely no fiesta,</i>

38:26.876 --> 38:29.380
<i>but we finished strong.</i>

38:29.380 --> 38:32.888
There's another pair
also safe from elimination.

38:32.888 --> 38:35.760
Congratulations,
Daniel and Gabriel.

38:35.760 --> 38:37.631
‐ Both: Thank you, Chef.
‐ Head up to the balcony.

38:37.631 --> 38:39.067
Thank you.

38:39.067 --> 38:40.804
Right now, I feel like
I'm taller than Gabriel.

38:40.804 --> 38:43.275
<i>I'm proud of what we did.</i>
<i>We both found our stride,</i>

38:43.275 --> 38:44.945
and you don't fall
into the top eight.

38:44.945 --> 38:46.749
You earn the top eight,
and that's what we did today.

38:48.653 --> 38:50.456
Gordon:
Jeff, Caitlin,
Eboni, Yachecia,

38:50.456 --> 38:52.895
both platters
were substandard,

38:52.895 --> 38:55.634
both teams were fragmented.

38:55.634 --> 38:58.973
However, there was one team
that managed to salvage

38:58.973 --> 39:00.644
two items on that platter.

39:00.644 --> 39:03.415
The team that is safe...

39:06.087 --> 39:08.593
Eboni, Yachecia,

39:08.593 --> 39:10.029
head on up to the balcony.

39:10.029 --> 39:11.699
Oh, my goodness.

39:11.699 --> 39:13.468
<i>I cannot believe</i>
<i>I'm on this balcony.</i>

39:13.468 --> 39:14.705
<i>I was prepared to go home.</i>

39:14.705 --> 39:16.041
<i>But I'm still here,</i>

39:16.041 --> 39:17.276
so I'm gonna go ahead
and work it out.

39:17.276 --> 39:18.880
I've been struggling
my whole life, baby.

39:18.880 --> 39:20.750
Can't one person and one dish
bring me down. Not today.

39:24.424 --> 39:26.428
Jeff and Caitlin,
this is really tough.

39:26.428 --> 39:28.298
Uh, that was a difficult task,

39:28.298 --> 39:30.971
but both of you put in
a weak performance tonight.

39:30.971 --> 39:34.444
There's no cohesive team spirit
across that platter.

39:34.444 --> 39:36.481
Jeff, you were overbearing.

39:36.481 --> 39:39.588
And, Caitlin, it's almost
like you were prepared

39:39.588 --> 39:42.460
to take a back seat
and be guided by Jeff,

39:42.460 --> 39:44.430
and that voice disappeared.

39:46.702 --> 39:51.545
The individual
that we're sending home...

39:52.981 --> 39:55.654
Caitlin...

39:55.654 --> 39:56.522
your time is done.

39:58.526 --> 40:01.699
Please say good‐bye to Jeff.

40:01.699 --> 40:02.668
Good job.

40:04.738 --> 40:06.842
‐ Be strong.
‐ Okay.

40:06.842 --> 40:09.648
Oh, Caitlin,
how do you feel?

40:09.648 --> 40:11.552
After having
learned so much

40:11.552 --> 40:12.821
and had so many
ups and downs,

40:12.821 --> 40:15.225
I really was gaining
confidence in myself.

40:15.225 --> 40:18.065
I want to thank
the three of you personally

40:18.065 --> 40:19.334
for believing in me
as much as you have,

40:19.334 --> 40:21.539
‐ so thank you for that.
‐ Come say good‐bye.

40:21.539 --> 40:23.342
Cate:
You're amazing, Caitlin!

40:23.342 --> 40:26.114
‐ Thank you, Gordon.
‐ Caitlin, you're great.
Keep cooking, huh?

40:26.114 --> 40:27.684
‐ Girl, we believe in you.
‐ Thank you for
all the feedback.

40:27.684 --> 40:28.786
Thank you.

40:28.786 --> 40:31.191
‐ Love you, Caitlin.
‐ I love you guys.

40:31.191 --> 40:32.627
Good luck, everyone.

40:32.627 --> 40:34.965
Caitlin:
<i>I'm definitely disappointed,</i>

40:34.965 --> 40:36.802
<i>but I think the judges made</i>
<i>the right decision</i>

40:36.802 --> 40:39.708
because tonight I can see

40:39.708 --> 40:41.946
why they didn't think
my voice came through.

40:41.946 --> 40:46.488
<i>But I can't be sad</i>
<i>that I was only a part</i>
<i>of the top nine.</i>

40:46.488 --> 40:47.958
<i>Like, the top nine?</i>
<i>That's amazing.</i>

40:50.329 --> 40:53.335
<i>I'm so thankful</i>
<i>for this experience,</i>

40:53.335 --> 40:55.907
for putting me in a position
to learn and grow.

40:55.907 --> 40:59.247
‐ Thank you, guys.
‐ Keep cooking.

40:59.247 --> 41:02.420
I consider this competition,
for me, a success.

41:06.695 --> 41:08.699
‐ Announcer : <i>Next week...</i>
‐ ( all cheering )

41:08.699 --> 41:10.570
Is Christina driving?

41:10.570 --> 41:13.543
‐ <i>the top eight...</i>
‐ Welcome to Big Bear Lake.

41:13.543 --> 41:14.945
<i>go back to basics.</i>

41:14.945 --> 41:17.450
This is the great outdoors,
so your kitchen...

41:17.450 --> 41:20.122
‐ Ugh.
‐ ...is a campground.

41:20.122 --> 41:22.994
<i>But in this fish out of water</i>
<i>team challenge...</i>

41:22.994 --> 41:24.832
This is so hard
to cook on here.

41:24.832 --> 41:27.002
<i>whose dish will be</i>
<i>the catch of the day...</i>

41:27.002 --> 41:28.138
Yachecia:
That's beautiful.

41:28.138 --> 41:29.608
<i>and whose</i>
<i>MasterChef dreams...</i>

41:29.608 --> 41:31.077
‐ Gordon: Potato salad?
‐ <i>will sink...</i>

41:31.077 --> 41:33.448
‐ Stop. Who's idea was that?
‐ <i>to the bottom?</i>

41:33.448 --> 41:35.920
We're not in a picnic.
Absolute rubbish.
