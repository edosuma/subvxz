by a cell phone company?

04:37.210 --> 04:41.146

pro-tobacco programs...

04:44.517 --> 04:47.953
- killing wild donkeys and Israel.
- Good old government.

04:48.054 --> 04:52.252
Yeah, but corporate sponsorship
cheapens our nation's treasures.

11:57.616 --> 12:01.347
Anyway, when it comes to stress,
I believe laughter is the best medicine.

12:22.541 --> 12:25.374
Well, I could prescribe
some harsh antacids...

12:25.478 --> 12:30.313

They're not all crazy, Dad.

12:49.969 --> 12:52.062
Sure they are, honey.

12:52.171 --> 12:55.572
You know,just because you say
something is crazy, doesn't make it so.

And just because you think museums
are boring and demolition derbies are fun...

12:58.978 --> 13:01.276
