00:31.404 --> 00:33.503
Breaking news here, guys,
out of Hollywood this morning.

00:33.538 --> 00:35.340
C-list actor...
C-list actor...

00:35.375 --> 00:37.001
Let's upgrade him.
The devoted actor...

00:37.036 --> 00:38.574
Longtime actor...
Emerging actor...

00:38.609 --> 00:42.545
Up-and-coming actor,
John Durfy Junior, has died.

00:42.580 --> 00:43.843
What?
What?

00:43.878 --> 00:45.383
Apparently,
he was attempting a stunt

00:45.418 --> 00:47.583
to prepare for his upcoming role
as Harry Houdini.

00:47.618 --> 00:48.683
Whoa.
He got the gig.

00:48.718 --> 00:50.047
This story is crazy.

00:50.082 --> 00:52.687
So, allegedly,
Mr. Durfy was a method actor

00:52.722 --> 00:54.854
and was working with
a retired magician.

00:54.889 --> 00:56.856
For those who don't understand
method acting,

00:56.891 --> 00:59.397
it's usually when
one actor decides
to take it really seriously

00:59.432 --> 01:01.168
and bums out everyone else
on the set.

01:01.203 --> 01:03.236
He needs a better method.
He was doin' a stunt.

01:03.271 --> 01:04.666
Stunt went wrong--
Stunt gone wrong--

01:04.701 --> 01:06.206
Sounds like a stunt
gone wrong right there.

01:06.241 --> 01:08.274
Yeah, it did.
I mean, it really went wrong.

01:08.309 --> 01:12.773
Durfy died during a stunt
gone wrong involving Durfy
being handcuffed...

01:12.808 --> 01:14.907
Attempting to swallow a...

01:14.942 --> 01:16.106
A key?

01:16.141 --> 01:18.713
[all]
...he tragically choked on.

01:18.748 --> 01:21.254
Entertainment sources say
it's another senseless death

01:21.289 --> 01:23.388
at the hands of method acting.

01:23.423 --> 01:24.752
That is sad news.
[cohost] Wow.

01:24.787 --> 01:26.589
What a terrible tragedy.
Whew.

01:26.624 --> 01:29.361
John Durfy Junior,
may he rest in peace.

01:34.830 --> 01:36.302
[mourners murmuring]

02:03.628 --> 02:07.124
[sighs]
I-- I can't believe it.
I just can't believe it.

02:07.159 --> 02:09.698
[sniffles]
Neither can I.

02:10.536 --> 02:11.997
I feel like
I just saw him.

02:13.374 --> 02:15.440
Yeah, he just called me
last week.

02:17.939 --> 02:20.676
It was a butt-dial,
but still...

02:21.712 --> 02:23.217
It's just not real.

02:24.550 --> 02:26.352
It can't be real.

02:26.387 --> 02:28.387
Hey,
what if it's not real?

02:29.291 --> 02:30.587
It's real, Zane.

02:31.854 --> 02:33.260
So where's Shelly?

02:35.330 --> 02:37.187
[Doc] He's outside.
He needed a minute.

02:37.222 --> 02:39.332
[bell tolling]
[crying]

02:43.800 --> 02:45.437
[speaker]
I think we can get started.

02:45.472 --> 02:48.000
I wanna thank everybody
for being here today

02:49.069 --> 02:51.641
to honor
the life of my brother,

02:53.040 --> 02:55.205
Murphy John Durfy Junior.

02:55.240 --> 02:58.109
It means a lot.
His name was Murphy Durfy?

02:58.144 --> 02:59.319
I had no idea.

02:59.354 --> 03:00.551
I didn't know that.
Shh. Doc.

03:00.586 --> 03:02.487
Since Mom and Dad passed,

03:02.522 --> 03:07.888
it's just been
me and my brother
and my sister.

03:07.923 --> 03:10.693
I wanna thank Uncle Tommy
for comin' all the way up
from Texas.

03:13.566 --> 03:15.126
Thanks, Tommy.

03:15.161 --> 03:17.304
What?

03:17.339 --> 03:21.099
You know, Durfy was older
than I am, but I always
felt like the big brother.

03:22.938 --> 03:24.443
Always looked after him.

03:25.446 --> 03:26.940
Tried to do my best.

03:29.747 --> 03:31.582
Standin' up here today,
I realize...

03:33.388 --> 03:35.322
maybe I didn't do enough.

03:35.357 --> 03:37.247
Oh, hell no, Jack.

03:37.282 --> 03:39.986
No, you were the best brother
he could ever ask for.

03:40.021 --> 03:44.298
Hell, if they had a--
a buckle for best brother,

03:44.333 --> 03:46.333
yours would be
the size of Texas.

03:46.368 --> 03:47.796
Go Cowboys!

03:47.831 --> 03:49.127
[mourners murmur]

03:49.162 --> 03:51.030
[Jack] Thank you, Tommy.
Appreciate that.

03:51.065 --> 03:51.932
What?
Okay.

03:51.967 --> 03:54.374
[sniffles] Anyway,

03:54.409 --> 03:58.972
if anybody would like to
get up here and share a memory,
now's the time.

04:00.448 --> 04:03.581
"Durfy was my friend,
and when I lost my nuts,
Durfy treated me--

04:03.616 --> 04:06.716
always treated me
like a person who had nuts."
[cries]

04:18.092 --> 04:19.630
[grunts]

04:35.142 --> 04:36.647
Hi, everybody. I'm Bob.

04:39.344 --> 04:41.586
Me and these guys
grew up with Durf.

04:42.754 --> 04:44.787
As you can see, we're--
we're pack animals.

04:44.822 --> 04:46.822
We practically
raised each other.

04:48.023 --> 04:49.396
We're family.

04:51.400 --> 04:55.666
[sighs] And when we were kids,
we started this thing
called the Buddy Games.

04:56.999 --> 05:00.836
It started as Wiffle ball
in the backyard, and--

05:00.871 --> 05:03.267
Well, it evolved
into a tradition

05:04.270 --> 05:05.808
that continues even today.

05:06.877 --> 05:08.415
It's ours.

05:09.110 --> 05:10.208
And Durfy...

05:16.084 --> 05:17.787
And Durfy showed up...

05:19.725 --> 05:22.187
No matter where he was in life,
he always showed up.

05:23.729 --> 05:26.026
We all did.

05:26.061 --> 05:28.996
We show up for each other.
I mean, that's the point, right?

05:30.901 --> 05:32.329
Well, today...

05:35.367 --> 05:36.905
today we're down a man.

05:39.074 --> 05:42.878
And I-I-- I just...
I don't think any of us
can believe it.

05:42.913 --> 05:45.012
[Jack]
You know, I remember loanin'--

05:45.047 --> 05:49.489
loanin' Durfy some money
for a few of those Buddy Games.

05:49.524 --> 05:52.789
Even though I thought
they were a little lame
and a total waste of time.

05:52.824 --> 05:56.628
[mourners chuckle]
They were important to him,
and that's what mattered.

05:57.598 --> 05:59.059
'Cause that's
what brothers do.

05:59.798 --> 06:01.193
Thank you, Bob.

06:01.228 --> 06:04.031
Would anyone else
like to come up and share?

06:04.066 --> 06:06.000
Yeah, I--
I'd like to say somethin'.

06:06.035 --> 06:07.441
That's why we're here, Jack.

06:08.103 --> 06:09.135
Go, buddy.

06:12.877 --> 06:14.074
It's okay.

06:14.109 --> 06:15.240
Durfy...

06:16.782 --> 06:19.376
He wasn't just
one of my best friends.

06:21.886 --> 06:25.283
He was also my first patient
as a chiropractor.

06:26.451 --> 06:28.022
When I got certified,

06:28.057 --> 06:31.289
everyone was too scared
to have me work on 'em.

06:33.095 --> 06:35.128
Except for Durfy. [chuckles]

06:36.736 --> 06:39.737
He never sued me.
Doesn't matter
how bad I hurt him.

06:39.772 --> 06:41.167
[mourners chuckle]

06:41.202 --> 06:43.070
Oh, and I hurt him.

06:43.105 --> 06:44.302
[all laughing]

06:46.614 --> 06:48.339
Okay, great.

06:48.374 --> 06:49.747
[Zane] Thanks, Jack.
That--

06:49.782 --> 06:51.408
Uh, Zane here. [chuckles]

06:53.786 --> 06:57.755
Durfy had such
a beautiful heart.
[chuckles]

06:59.418 --> 07:03.321
He was the first person
that I ever told that I was gay.

07:05.193 --> 07:06.995
That's right.

07:07.965 --> 07:09.734
You're not alone, Uncle Tommy.

07:09.769 --> 07:11.395
[clears throat]

07:11.430 --> 07:13.738
I knew that I could trust him.

07:15.973 --> 07:18.303
And I knew that
he would never judge me.

07:20.945 --> 07:22.780
And he kept my secret for...

07:23.475 --> 07:25.552
for decades.

07:25.587 --> 07:29.149
Until I came out again
to Doc on his table.
[chuckles]

07:29.184 --> 07:31.283
Isn't that right, Doc?
[laughs]
Yeah.

07:32.759 --> 07:35.694
Durfy also
helped me put together
my first leather swing set.

07:35.729 --> 07:38.158
[mourners chuckle]
If you all don't know
what that is...

07:38.193 --> 07:39.962
Okay, Zane, that was great.
...it's an indoor...

07:39.997 --> 07:41.359
Zane, that was great.
It's for indoors.

07:41.394 --> 07:43.031
Zane, I think
they'll figure it out.

07:43.066 --> 07:45.429
[Bender]
Well, Murphy Durfy.

07:45.464 --> 07:49.235
I met Durfy in kindergarten.
That's how far back we go.

07:49.270 --> 07:51.402
I was on the playground,
picking my nose.

07:51.437 --> 07:54.647
Kid walks up, laughs at me,
punches me in the face.

07:54.682 --> 07:57.441
This squirrelly kid named Durfy
tackled that kid,

07:57.476 --> 07:58.816
pinned him down,

07:58.851 --> 08:01.511
and he goes,
"You think that's funny?

08:01.546 --> 08:02.853
'Cause it's snot."

08:02.888 --> 08:04.283
[all laughing]

08:04.318 --> 08:06.087
And he proceeded to
pick the kid's nose

08:06.122 --> 08:09.695
and slap the kid's boogers
right in his face.

08:09.730 --> 08:11.961
Then I joined in.
It was just pick and slap.

08:11.996 --> 08:13.765
Pick and slap, pick and slap.

08:13.800 --> 08:15.767
Okay, Bender, Bender.

08:15.802 --> 08:18.297
That's enough
from you guys, okay?

08:18.332 --> 08:20.167
You know, you're the reason
we're here, right?

08:20.202 --> 08:23.038
All the partyin'
and your stupid
fuckin' Buddy Games.

08:23.073 --> 08:24.677
Look where it got you.

08:24.712 --> 08:26.910
You're nothin' but single,
middle-aged losers.

08:26.945 --> 08:29.077
You never grew up.
[imitates fart]

08:29.112 --> 08:31.475
[mourners chuckle]

08:31.510 --> 08:33.378
I got this, Jack.

08:33.413 --> 08:35.721
Now, I've heard
just about enough
of this shit.

08:35.756 --> 08:37.756
There are three
important things in life:

08:37.791 --> 08:40.924
hard work, determination
and the good book.

08:40.959 --> 08:43.025
And that all went out the window

08:43.060 --> 08:47.733
when he started hangin' out
with his buddies
instead of his family.

08:47.768 --> 08:50.329
And look,
he didn't even have kids.
Hell, I got nine!

08:50.364 --> 08:53.706
That's right. And tellin' him
that he needed to be an actor

08:53.741 --> 08:55.906
instead of followin'
in the family business

08:55.941 --> 08:57.237
and doin' good, honest work?

08:57.272 --> 08:59.338
No, he goes chasin' dreams.

08:59.373 --> 09:02.506
Well, I've said it once,
I'll say it again,
dreams are stupid!

09:02.541 --> 09:04.409
Exactly right!

09:04.444 --> 09:06.950
I've said it nine times!

09:06.985 --> 09:09.381
Don't chase your dreams.
What?

09:09.416 --> 09:12.186
Come on.
[Jack] Finally, somebody's
speakin' some sense around here.

09:12.221 --> 09:16.256
Jack, we only encouraged Durfy
to do what made him happy, okay?
That's what friends do.

09:16.291 --> 09:18.324
We loved Durfy like a brother,
and you know it.

09:18.359 --> 09:19.930
You know what?
He already had a brother.

09:19.965 --> 09:21.426
Where you going?
What's he doing?

09:21.461 --> 09:22.933
We're gonna go spread
Durfy's ashes

09:22.968 --> 09:25.364
out at the family business,
where he belongs.

09:25.399 --> 09:27.773
Anybody else
who wants to come along,
you're more than welcome.

09:27.808 --> 09:29.104
He wouldn't want that.

09:29.139 --> 09:31.337
That is a terrible idea,
Jack.

No, it didn't.

It's basically the same thing.

a fucking urn.

Are we criminals now?

Man, I can't go to jail.

got a whole life to live.

13:03.683 --> 13:05.452
None of us
are going to jail, okay?

Yeah.

Are you fuckin' stupid?

13:26.178 --> 13:27.243

Double-Doubles all the way.

how about a place that isn't
a fast-food restaurant?

Come on, we got the chopper.
We can go wherever the fuck
we want to.

Of course.

Oh, my...

30:45.986 --> 30:47.084
I can fix that.

30:47.119 --> 30:48.844
[Shelly] No.

30:48.879 --> 30:51.385
[groans]
[Doc] Trust me,
I'm a trained professional.

30:51.420 --> 30:53.684
Hold him, guys.
Did I get her number?

30:54.522 --> 30:57.325
[groans] Ow, ow.

30:57.360 --> 30:58.326
My nose...

30:58.361 --> 30:59.932
[screams]
There you go.

30:59.967 --> 31:02.495
Oh, fuckin' biscuits and gravy.

31:02.530 --> 31:04.101
Doc, don't... Ow.

31:04.136 --> 31:07.269
[Doc] Just go like...
[scream echoes]

31:09.636 --> 31:11.075
Good as new.

31:11.110 --> 31:13.374
Yeah, I know you enjoyed that.

31:13.409 --> 31:15.046
Little bit. Little bit.

31:15.081 --> 31:17.477
Oh, there you are.

31:17.941 --> 31:19.952
You lost.

31:19.987 --> 31:22.988
But, hey,
I didn't think you'd make it
past the first round.

31:23.023 --> 31:26.090
Pretty impressive
for a bunch of old dicks.

31:26.125 --> 31:29.291
You're older
than we are, Marty.
Okay, boomer, don't flex.

31:29.326 --> 31:31.524
Don't talk like that.
You have gray pubic hair.

31:31.559 --> 31:34.725
I am sorry I didn't
tell you guys when
I started the games, okay?

31:34.760 --> 31:37.629
But I never expected
to see you again, ever.

31:37.664 --> 31:40.929
So what do you say?
Can we call it even?
Yes. Yes, please.

31:40.964 --> 31:42.799
So, where's that
other friend of yours?

31:42.834 --> 31:45.043
You remember, that goofy guy
who was in love
with my waitress?

31:45.078 --> 31:46.572
Durf, yeah.

31:50.875 --> 31:53.150
Oh, shit, man.
I'm sorry to hear that.

31:53.185 --> 31:55.548
What brings you back here now?

31:55.583 --> 31:57.220
We were gonna spread
his ashes at the lake,

31:57.255 --> 31:59.453
but it was spring break,
and it was a full-on shit show.

31:59.488 --> 32:02.225
Oh, man. So, where
are you gonna do it?

32:02.260 --> 32:04.227
I don't know.
It's gettin' dark.

32:04.262 --> 32:06.625
I guess we'll find
a place to stay
and figure it out tomorrow.

32:06.660 --> 32:08.429
Good luck with that.

32:08.464 --> 32:09.760
We're all booked up around here.
It's spring break.

32:09.795 --> 32:11.894
Oh, that's just great.
Shit.

32:11.929 --> 32:12.796
Fuck.

32:15.405 --> 32:16.899
[Marty] Oh, um...

32:19.838 --> 32:21.706
You should probably
have this.

32:21.741 --> 32:23.444
Oh, Durf!
That's the girl.

32:23.479 --> 32:25.776
[Doc] Look how young he is.
[Bender] Yes, that's her.

32:25.811 --> 32:27.349
What's her name again?
Celia.

32:27.384 --> 32:29.219
Yeah, that's right, Celia.

32:29.254 --> 32:31.815
She left here about the same
time this photo was taken.

32:31.850 --> 32:33.421
Cute girl, real sweet.

32:33.456 --> 32:35.654
[chuckles]
Real country though.

32:35.689 --> 32:38.162
You know, she quit
after I banned you guys,

32:38.197 --> 32:41.594
but I'll tell you somethin',
she was in love
with your friend.

32:41.629 --> 32:44.927
Wow. God, remember
he talked about her
for years?

32:44.962 --> 32:47.039
He never stopped.
Where does she live now?

32:47.074 --> 32:49.107
Well, last I heard,

32:49.142 --> 32:52.737
she, uh, moved to a small town
not too far from here
called Backwater.

32:52.772 --> 32:54.871
Right, the backwater town
is called Backwater?

32:54.906 --> 32:56.477
[chuckles]
[phone ringing]

32:56.512 --> 32:58.446
All right, well,
thank you, Marty.

32:58.481 --> 33:00.151
I appreciate it.
[Marty] No worries.

33:00.186 --> 33:01.548
Oh, it's Zane.
Hey, hey, hey.

33:01.583 --> 33:03.121
Oh, nice.
How you doin'?

33:03.156 --> 33:04.320
Hi, Zane!
You okay?

33:04.355 --> 33:05.618
You look completely different.

33:05.653 --> 33:07.356
<i>Yeah, I had to change it up.</i>

33:07.391 --> 33:09.787
<i>Bob, I'm startin' to</i>
<i>get freaked out, man.</i>

33:09.822 --> 33:11.954
<i>Jack got ahold of</i>
<i>my phone number somehow.</i>

33:11.989 --> 33:15.331
<i>He keeps calling and calling</i>
<i>and leaving these</i>
<i>very threatening voice mails.</i>

33:15.366 --> 33:17.069
I can hear Uncle Tommy
in the background,

33:17.104 --> 33:19.566
twirling his mustache
and polishing his fucking gun.

33:19.601 --> 33:22.371
Hey, he's just
playin' mind games.
Block that shit, bro.

33:22.406 --> 33:24.307
Yeah, but if he
already has my number,

33:24.342 --> 33:26.540
who's to say
he hasn't figured out
where I live too, Doc?

33:26.575 --> 33:28.575
Listen to Doc.
Stay calm, don't engage.

33:28.610 --> 33:30.346
He's just trying
to get information out of you.

33:30.381 --> 33:33.217
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>Yeah, you're probably right.</i>

33:33.252 --> 33:35.318
<i>I just wish I hadn't</i>
<i>smacked him in the balls.</i>

33:35.353 --> 33:38.222
<i>By the way, Jack...</i>
<i>all broomstick.</i>

33:38.257 --> 33:40.015
[Bob] Who's that?
<i>Who's who?</i>

33:40.050 --> 33:42.094
I see a little silhouetto
of a man.

33:43.427 --> 33:44.954
Oh. [chuckles]

33:44.989 --> 33:47.231
That's Whitley.
He's my new lover.

33:49.268 --> 33:51.169
<i>What?</i>

33:51.204 --> 33:55.668
Uh, nothin'. I don't know.
You guys just kinda look alike.

33:55.703 --> 33:58.539
Yeah, Doc, my life is in danger.
I had to go incognito.

33:58.574 --> 34:02.147
Luckily, Whitley owns a salon,
and he used himself
as a template.

34:02.182 --> 34:03.841
Hey, Wonderbuns,
come here for a sec.

34:03.876 --> 34:05.007
[chuckles] God.

34:05.042 --> 34:06.041
Wonderbuns?

34:07.385 --> 34:09.352
<i>They think we look alike.</i>
<i>Aw.</i>

34:09.387 --> 34:12.047
<i>Which means</i>
<i>you did a fantastic job.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

34:12.082 --> 34:15.556
Dude, it's like where
a person gets a dog, and then
they start to look alike.

34:15.591 --> 34:18.229
It's like that,
except two gay guys.
Yep.

34:18.264 --> 34:20.858
<i>Loud and proud.</i>
<i>Don't hate us</i>
<i>because we're beautiful.</i>

34:20.893 --> 34:23.267
That's not why we hate you.
No, I love it, Zane.

34:23.302 --> 34:25.170
You can literally
go fuck yourself.

34:25.205 --> 34:28.899
[Zane]<i> Bender!</i>
Wow. Your friends seem nice.

34:29.935 --> 34:31.066

34:31.706 --> 34:33.409
<i>Thanks a lot.</i>

34:33.444 --> 34:35.213
<i>Guess I won't be getting</i>
<i>any ass tonight.</i>

34:35.248 --> 34:36.874
Hey, fellas,
time to wrap your shit up.

34:36.909 --> 34:39.151
About five minutes, yeah?
All right, all right.

34:39.186 --> 34:40.284
Okay.

34:40.319 --> 34:41.516
Oh, hey,
check this out, Zane.

34:42.354 --> 34:44.288
Remember her?

34:44.323 --> 34:47.687
That's Celia.
The one Durfy
never stopped talkin' about.

34:47.722 --> 34:49.986
<i>Celia.</i>
<i>Oh, my God. Yes.</i>

34:50.021 --> 34:52.923
Hey, do you think
maybe she'd wanna come with us
to scatter his ashes?

34:52.958 --> 34:55.992
I am loving
the sound of that.
It's so romantic.

34:56.027 --> 34:58.500
That's a solid idea.
I think she'd wanna know.

34:58.535 --> 35:00.766
I think we should find Celia
for Durfy.

35:00.801 --> 35:03.670
Oh, I miss you guys.
I wish I was there with you.

35:03.705 --> 35:06.277
But don't worry about me.
I'll be safe.

35:06.312 --> 35:08.576
Here with Whitley.
In the swing.

35:08.611 --> 35:09.973
All right, buddy,
we'll keep you posted.

35:10.008 --> 35:11.216
Okay, bye.

35:12.780 --> 35:14.516
That's so sweet.

35:14.551 --> 35:16.518
[Whitley]
I need you. Come to me.
Yep.

35:16.553 --> 35:18.652
Where the fuck
are we gonna sleep tonight?

35:18.687 --> 35:21.952
No idea.
[person] You're quite
the gladiator, Bobfather.

35:26.024 --> 35:27.331
I'm sorry,
do I know you?

35:28.125 --> 35:29.663
I go by Phoenix.

35:31.337 --> 35:35.064
I watched you compete,
and I came away quite impressed.

35:36.133 --> 35:37.308
Thank you.

35:38.773 --> 35:40.839
I'd say you and your friends
look lost,

35:40.874 --> 35:43.710
but I know
there's no such thing.

35:48.519 --> 35:50.013
Can I help you with somethin'?

35:50.048 --> 35:52.521
My apologies
if you find my gaze
intimidating.

35:52.556 --> 35:54.787
I believe the surest way
to really know someone

35:54.822 --> 35:56.624
is to look unflinchingly
at them.

35:56.659 --> 35:58.362
Did you lose your spaceship?

35:58.397 --> 36:01.024
[chuckles]

36:01.059 --> 36:03.928
I welcome you and your friends
to a party this evening.

36:03.963 --> 36:04.830
Ooh.

36:04.865 --> 36:06.799
It's the full moon.

36:06.834 --> 36:10.869
And my friends and I
will honor the moon queen
with a bacchanalia.

36:10.904 --> 36:12.640
A fucking alien?
What'd she say?
[Bob] Yeah.

36:12.675 --> 36:14.972
That sounds nice,
but I-- I think we're good.

36:15.007 --> 36:18.679
Be that as it may, I sense
the world has brought you and I
here tonight for a reason.

36:18.714 --> 36:20.285
Who am I to reject fate?

36:21.244 --> 36:22.584
Come to the party.

36:24.390 --> 36:28.293
And if you need
a place to sleep,
that can be arranged.

36:28.328 --> 36:32.363
When the moon is high,
find us on the far side
of the lake.

36:34.257 --> 36:35.597
[whispers]
Listen for the song.

36:39.735 --> 36:41.702
There will be activities...

36:46.313 --> 36:49.204
Well, that was weird, man.
[exhales] Oh, my God.

36:49.239 --> 36:50.777
Yeah.

36:50.812 --> 36:52.977
Yeah, but she did offer us
a place to sleep tonight.

36:53.012 --> 36:55.650
Pretty fucking hot too, man.
I just caught a semi.

36:55.685 --> 36:57.322
She said party.

36:57.357 --> 36:59.819
And we're all fuckin' weird.
We should just go.

37:01.152 --> 37:02.888
Let's do this.

[wolf howling]

37:05.189 --> 37:07.695

is this party? We're on
the other side of the lake.

37:13.802 --> 37:16.671
Doc, she offered us
a place to sleep.
We've got no other option.

37:16.706 --> 37:19.608
Just keep going.
Yeah, we do, Bob. We can
get back in your helicopter

37:19.643 --> 37:22.270
and go to Bumfuck Island
or whatever and find Celia.

37:22.305 --> 37:25.042
Yeah, just show up in
a helicopter in the middle
of the night, unannounced.

37:25.077 --> 37:27.176
People fucking
love that, Bender.
That's a great idea.

37:27.211 --> 37:30.245
I'm sure a lot of people do...
Hey, shut up!
Shut up, you idiots.

39:56.701 --> 39:58.998
You should probably
get that looked at.
Yeah, it's pretty bad.

39:59.033 --> 40:00.703
Have we met before?

40:00.738 --> 40:01.770
No.

40:02.641 --> 40:04.575
You sure?

40:04.610 --> 40:07.677
Uh...
I can taste
your pheromones.

40:07.712 --> 40:10.812
Hey, can you buy me a drink?
I'll chow your box for a week.

40:11.617 --> 40:12.913
Two wet ones.

40:12.948 --> 40:14.948
My-- My box is, uh,
singing. [chuckles]

40:14.983 --> 40:16.279
Hmm.

40:18.250 --> 40:19.491
Are you sure
we've never met?

40:20.527 --> 40:22.890
Nope.
Okay.

40:22.925 --> 40:24.419
Fuck.
Isn't that the girl from...

40:24.454 --> 40:25.453
I know.

40:25.488 --> 40:29.633
So, what will your journey be?

40:29.668 --> 40:31.261
Yeah...
Yeah, I'm good, man.

40:31.296 --> 40:32.735
No, no, no,
we're good.
Hey, Doc.

40:32.770 --> 40:34.935
What the fuck
are you doin' over there?

40:34.970 --> 40:39.775
Mmm. These shiitakes
taste like shit,
but I'm fuckin' hungry, man.

40:39.810 --> 40:42.173
You guys want some?
Those are magic mushrooms.

40:43.583 --> 40:44.813
Shut the fuck up.

40:44.848 --> 40:46.749
[Shelly laughs]
They are.

40:46.784 --> 40:48.751
Don't fuckin' tell me that.
I just ate ten of these things.

40:48.786 --> 40:50.984
You're gonna trip
your balls off, dude.
Oh, my God.

40:51.019 --> 40:52.953
Fuck, I'm gonna be so high.
[Headwound] Yes.

40:52.988 --> 40:54.592
You're gonna be high
for, like, a week.

40:54.627 --> 40:56.594
Bob. Come on,
you gotta trip with me.

40:56.629 --> 40:58.794
No, I'm not...
Don't make me trip alone, man.

40:58.829 --> 41:00.323
Bender, come on. Please.

41:00.358 --> 41:02.567
Maybe one.
One? I took ten of 'em.

41:02.602 --> 41:04.096
I'm not gonna let you
trip alone.

41:04.131 --> 41:06.065
And also, I think
Durfy would want this.

41:06.100 --> 41:07.935
Yes, Durfy would want this.

41:07.970 --> 41:10.003
Shelly, come on.
I'm not taking
any fuckin' mushrooms.

41:10.038 --> 41:11.466
I'll eat
these pink things, though.

41:11.501 --> 41:12.643
Ooh.

41:12.678 --> 41:14.106
That's fun.

41:14.141 --> 41:15.877
[Doc] Well, maybe
a gummy might mellow me out.

41:15.912 --> 41:17.879
[Bob] I'll have a couple of 'em.

41:17.914 --> 41:19.980
[Bender] I want this one.
Those are good.

41:20.015 --> 41:22.818
What do you recommend?
What goes good with the pink?

41:22.853 --> 41:25.051
Put your hand on things,
and whatever sticks.

41:26.252 --> 41:27.823
Maybe a second one.

41:27.858 --> 41:31.057
I ate too many bees today.
[Bob] You did what?

41:32.764 --> 41:35.292
[Shelly] Oh.
[people moaning]

41:35.327 --> 41:37.734
Well, this feels naughty.
[chuckles]

41:37.769 --> 41:39.197
Hey, man.

41:39.232 --> 41:42.035
Whoa! 'Sup, dudes?
What do you got there?

41:42.070 --> 41:44.169
This?
It's-- It's nothing.

41:44.204 --> 41:46.204
I'm cool, man.
I did acid in Vegas.

41:46.239 --> 41:49.108
Okay, look, Old Man Winter,
you can't handle this.

41:49.143 --> 41:51.011
I can't handle it?
Yeah.

41:51.046 --> 41:52.749
I can't fuckin' handle it?
No.

41:52.784 --> 41:55.444
My wife blew my balls off
with a paint gun. Gimme.

41:55.479 --> 41:57.754
[croaking]

41:57.789 --> 42:00.185
Oh, shit! That's a frog!

42:00.220 --> 42:02.990
It's His Holiness, Toad Ra.

42:03.025 --> 42:05.355
Just one tap of the tongue

42:05.390 --> 42:09.194
is the most powerful
hallucinogen in the whole
western hemisphere.

42:09.229 --> 42:11.163
Ew, you lick that fuckin' frog?

42:11.198 --> 42:12.461
Toad.

42:12.496 --> 42:15.134
Gimme.
I can't be responsible, man.

42:15.169 --> 42:18.676
Gimme the frog.
Some people never come back
from this, friend.

42:18.711 --> 42:22.042
Oh, yeah? Hello, froggy.
[laughing]

42:22.077 --> 42:23.780
[croaking]

42:27.280 --> 42:31.920
Just one tap is enough
to dissolve all consciousness...

42:31.955 --> 42:33.317
What are you doing, man?

42:34.617 --> 42:37.288
That's an abomination!
Yo, give me that back, man.

42:38.423 --> 42:41.424
Do you have any idea
what you just did?

42:44.066 --> 42:45.527
No, dude!
[croaks]

42:45.562 --> 42:47.529
Holy...
Yo, give me that back.
Give me that.

42:47.564 --> 42:49.267
[Shelly]
I'll eat that fuckin' frog, bro.

42:49.302 --> 42:50.642
Who are you, man?

42:50.677 --> 42:52.534
You're welcome, sweetheart.
[laughs]

42:52.569 --> 42:54.646
Yeah, whatever, man.
Let's get outta here.

42:54.681 --> 42:58.749
Puffnuts, Butterscotch,
this guy's about to
go fuckin' nuts, man.

43:00.753 --> 43:03.886
See that, ladies?
I perform amphibalingous.

43:03.921 --> 43:07.219
Who wants to fuck?

43:07.254 --> 43:08.957
I do have to poop though.

43:16.736 --> 43:19.165
What is this,
some kind of a staring contest?

43:19.200 --> 43:25.776
No, this is the most intense
eye-gazing session
I've ever encountered.

43:25.811 --> 43:27.272
Eye-gazing?

43:28.440 --> 43:30.011
Not just the eyes.

43:30.574 --> 43:31.606
The soul.

43:32.983 --> 43:35.313
I can see your past life.

43:36.019 --> 43:38.481
<i>You are Sasquatch.</i>

43:38.516 --> 43:40.791
[chuckling]
I'm sorry,

43:40.826 --> 43:43.794
but there's
not enough drugs in the world
to make this interesting.

43:43.829 --> 43:45.620
Look.

43:45.655 --> 43:48.062
This isn't gonna work on me.
It's just--
<i>Deep.</i>

43:49.461 --> 43:50.702
Deep.

43:53.839 --> 43:56.466
You are good.

44:02.672 --> 44:05.915
Hey, what's up, man?
Do you have tequila or vodka?

44:05.950 --> 44:07.983
Hi. Um, no,
neither of those.

44:08.018 --> 44:10.414
What I do have
are supplies.

44:10.449 --> 44:12.317
I want a cocktail,
not a crayon.

44:12.352 --> 44:13.890
This is just, um--

44:13.925 --> 44:15.991
It's fun, it's soothing.

44:16.026 --> 44:18.697
Yeah, so is jerking off,
but I don't do that
in front of strangers.

44:19.722 --> 44:21.062
Okay.
Do you have whiskey?

44:21.097 --> 44:22.162
Just hear me out.

44:22.197 --> 44:23.559
I think we, as a society,

44:23.594 --> 44:26.738
I think we fail to satisfy
our inner child.

44:26.773 --> 44:28.938
Do you have
a crayon-flavored vodka?

44:28.973 --> 44:32.073
Uh, I think--
I think we both know
that's not a thing.

44:32.108 --> 44:33.668
Oh, who's that?

44:33.703 --> 44:35.912
Is that a good boy?
That's a good boy.

44:35.947 --> 44:38.277
Would you not
refer to them that way?

44:38.312 --> 44:40.411
What do you mean, "them"?
I'm talking to the dog.

44:40.446 --> 44:43.051
It's just that
you're using heteronormative,
cisgendered pronouns,

44:43.086 --> 44:44.712
and-- and we don't love that.

44:44.747 --> 44:47.055
It's offensive.
No idea what you just said.

44:47.090 --> 44:48.991
You're assuming
the dog's a male.

44:49.026 --> 44:52.093
I'm not assuming.
I'm just staring
at his nuts right now.

44:52.128 --> 44:56.295
I think you're suffering
from some pretty severe
toxic masculinity, okay?

44:56.330 --> 44:58.066
I find it triggering.
I'm regressing.

44:58.101 --> 45:00.464
So can you get the fuck
out of my room, Dad?

45:01.137 --> 45:02.906
Okay.

45:07.770 --> 45:09.605
<i>Now, do you see the answer?</i>

45:10.542 --> 45:11.750
Yes.

45:15.052 --> 45:16.381
Of course.

45:18.286 --> 45:19.417
Wait.

45:20.453 --> 45:22.024
Where are we?

45:22.059 --> 45:23.223
Where we belong.

45:23.258 --> 45:25.390
I feel so peaceful.

45:25.425 --> 45:26.897
Doc.

45:26.932 --> 45:28.393
Let us consummate.

45:28.428 --> 45:30.934
<i>Consummate.</i>

45:30.969 --> 45:32.727
Consummate?
Consummate.

45:32.762 --> 45:34.729
Do you mean, like--

45:34.764 --> 45:36.434
Consummate.
Consummate.

45:36.469 --> 45:38.040
Come-summate.

45:39.142 --> 45:41.010
Come-summate.

45:43.982 --> 45:46.114
Deep inside your soul.

45:47.216 --> 45:49.414
It smells like cheese.

45:54.960 --> 45:56.256
Wow.

45:56.291 --> 45:57.829
What a night.

45:57.864 --> 45:59.864
It's very humbling,
indeed.

46:01.032 --> 46:03.230
Oh, the summer stars
are amazing.

46:03.265 --> 46:05.397
I don't think
I've ever seen
anything so bright.

46:07.104 --> 46:08.466
I agree, but...

46:08.501 --> 46:09.940
But what?

46:09.975 --> 46:11.601
I don't wanna offend you,

46:11.636 --> 46:13.537
as you're clearly trying
to form a connection here,

46:13.572 --> 46:15.572
but I'd be remiss
not to point out your use

46:15.607 --> 46:17.981
of northern hemisphere-specific
seasonal language.

46:18.918 --> 46:20.148
Okay, you-- you lost me.

46:20.183 --> 46:22.282
Just a tiny
inclusive language thing.

46:22.317 --> 46:24.053
Yeah, I--
I still don't understand.

46:24.088 --> 46:27.419
Well, instead of summer,
I like to say August.

46:27.454 --> 46:31.555
Or even third quarter,
because although it might be
that warm season for me,

46:31.590 --> 46:34.525
it's not that warm season
for everybody else.

46:34.560 --> 46:36.395
We're all
in the same hemisphere here.

46:36.430 --> 46:38.826
Sure, but it's winter
in New Zealand.

46:38.861 --> 46:40.432
But we're not in New Zealand.

46:40.467 --> 46:42.170
Is anybody here in New Zealand?

46:42.205 --> 46:44.139
I'm just trying
to spread respect
and understanding.

46:44.174 --> 46:45.437
Is that a problem?

46:45.978 --> 46:47.538
No.

46:47.573 --> 46:52.917
No. No, I was just... admiring
the third-quarter stars.

46:52.952 --> 46:55.414
I appreciate your openness.
Bobfather!

46:55.449 --> 46:57.350
Just the man
I was looking for.
Come.

46:57.385 --> 46:59.484
There's something
I wanna show you.
Okay. Okay.

47:00.487 --> 47:02.619
Enjoy the evening.

47:02.654 --> 47:05.259
[Phoenix] I knew,
upon first seeing you, that you
were just the sort of man

47:05.294 --> 47:08.196
I have been both avoiding
and looking for
for quite some time.

47:08.231 --> 47:09.824
[Bob]
And what kind of man is that?

47:09.859 --> 47:11.903
Let's just say, of a time.

47:11.938 --> 47:13.498
Uh...
Old-fashioned.

47:13.533 --> 47:16.369
Macho, manly,
a real caveman.
[scoffs] Okay.

47:16.404 --> 47:18.833
Most younger men,
even the jocks,

47:18.868 --> 47:23.805
are more evolved,
emotionally available
and sensitive these days.

47:23.840 --> 47:26.610
You catch them crying
over cat food commercials.

47:26.645 --> 47:29.514
So, what are you trying to say?
You're-- You're into older men?

47:30.913 --> 47:32.583
No.
Oh.

47:32.618 --> 47:36.818
I have a thing
for competition.
Uh-huh.

47:36.853 --> 47:41.691
Years of toxic relationships
have led to much introspection
and soul-sculpting

47:41.726 --> 47:45.035
to reach the heightened form
you see before you now.

47:45.070 --> 47:50.106
I shed that former skin
like a snake sheds...

47:51.868 --> 47:54.011

47:54.046 --> 47:57.476
I'm sorry,
where are we going?
And yet, I can't help myself.

47:57.511 --> 48:01.678
Seeing you and your comrades
ignited a dormant creature
in me, yes!

48:01.713 --> 48:04.285
I feel the burning desire
to compete.

48:04.320 --> 48:07.519
And it burns, Bobfather.
It burns.

48:07.554 --> 48:11.358
The young reject competition,
but I know now that it
is the great equalizer.

48:11.393 --> 48:13.162
It drives us to oneness.

48:13.197 --> 48:16.726
One can be both mindful
and still strive for victory,
yes?

48:16.761 --> 48:19.135
I hadn't really
thought about it.
There you are.

48:19.170 --> 48:20.972
Can we leave?
These people suck.

48:21.007 --> 48:21.973
Come!

You gonna cry, Bobfather?

49:02.147 --> 49:04.147
No? You gonna cry?
[Bob] No.

49:04.182 --> 49:06.182
Show me your inner goddess,
Bobfather.

49:06.217 --> 49:08.250
My what?
Yes! Your inner goddess!

49:08.285 --> 49:10.450
My inner goddess?
Yes, let her shine!

49:10.485 --> 49:12.518

[groans]
Am I dying?

51:54.616 --> 51:56.484
Oh, my God, my head.

51:56.519 --> 51:58.618
[Bender]
Oh, my God. My head.

51:58.653 --> 51:59.751
Where are we?

51:59.786 --> 52:01.621
I don't know.

52:01.656 --> 52:04.052
Ow. Ow.
[groans]

52:04.087 --> 52:06.692
And how did we end up
in the same bed together?

52:06.727 --> 52:08.397
I don't know.

52:08.432 --> 52:11.631
What am I wearing? Did you
change my clothes last night?

52:11.666 --> 52:13.501
No, I didn't. I--

52:13.536 --> 52:15.866
I-- I don't--
I don't know how we got...

52:15.901 --> 52:17.901
I have no idea
where we are.

52:18.772 --> 52:20.178
This is so weird.

52:21.379 --> 52:24.281
Would you-- Would you
please put that thing away?

52:24.316 --> 52:25.777
What? Oh.

52:25.812 --> 52:28.318
Bob, this is what happens
to men in the morning.

52:28.353 --> 52:30.848
Yeah, they get erect.
Is your pussy hard?

52:30.883 --> 52:33.147
Just get rid of it, please.
Like a dick magician?

52:33.182 --> 52:34.819
Is that what you're saying?
Just disappear?

52:34.854 --> 52:37.459
Think of something gross.
I don't know. Whatever.

52:37.494 --> 52:38.988
Okay, fine.

52:39.023 --> 52:40.264
I can do that.

52:45.667 --> 52:49.471
Oh, my God.
How did you just...
How did you just do that?

52:49.506 --> 52:51.803
You said,
"Think of something gross,"

52:51.838 --> 52:53.508
so I thought of Shelly naked.

52:53.543 --> 52:56.038
It decreases boners
and induces vomiting.

52:56.073 --> 52:58.678
I'm gonna remember that.
I don't know when I'm
gonna need it, but--

52:58.713 --> 53:00.251
[voice on PA]
<i>Welcome, visitors.</i>

53:00.286 --> 53:02.517

<i>the Great Room where your host</i>

53:07.887 --> 53:09.953
Who the hell was that?
I don't know.

53:23.870 --> 53:25.474
[whispers]
Oh, my God.

53:26.741 --> 53:28.774
Oh, I'm starving.
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

53:28.809 --> 53:31.205
I remember that weird lady
from last night.

53:31.240 --> 53:33.482
Go say something.
She's right there.
What do you want me to...

53:33.517 --> 53:34.879
I don't know,
but say something.

53:34.914 --> 53:36.848
I don't want to
say anything. Go.

53:36.883 --> 53:37.915
Good mornin'.

53:37.950 --> 53:40.049
Morning.
Hey. [chuckles]

53:40.084 --> 53:42.117
I'm sorry,
what was your name again?

53:42.152 --> 53:44.328
Phoenix,
not weird lady.

53:44.924 --> 53:47.056
Sorry.

53:47.091 --> 53:50.334
Yeah, uh, sorry. [chuckles]
We got fucked up last night.

53:50.369 --> 53:52.226
Yeah, obliterated.
Obliterated.

53:52.261 --> 53:55.405
Yes, we found
a higher plane last night.

53:55.440 --> 54:00.201
Such madness happens
on the full moon,
but I trust you slept well?

54:00.236 --> 54:03.270
Yeah, yeah. I've--
I've felt better.

54:03.305 --> 54:04.612
So, this is your place?

54:04.647 --> 54:06.713
Xanadu, my home.
The fruits of my labor.

54:06.748 --> 54:09.320
Yeah, it's cool.
Why does the house talk?

54:09.355 --> 54:13.885
That's K.A.R.E.N.
It stands for Kind Automated
Righteous Emotional Neurobot.

54:13.920 --> 54:15.425
She runs my household.

54:16.725 --> 54:18.956
So, what is it that you do?

54:18.991 --> 54:20.056
Do?

54:22.060 --> 54:24.258
I guess you could say

54:24.293 --> 54:27.965
I simply exist
in this human vessel

54:28.000 --> 54:30.803
to spread
my love and knowledge

54:30.838 --> 54:35.478
to lift up other souls
and guide them
towards enlightenment.

54:35.513 --> 54:37.744
So that paid for this?

54:37.779 --> 54:42.243
Also, I created an app
that translates dog barks
into emojis.

54:42.278 --> 54:44.751
While I don't subscribe
to paper currency,

54:44.786 --> 54:47.985
I will admit
it was a necessary sacrifice
of my talents

54:48.020 --> 54:50.218
to provide this sanctuary.

54:50.253 --> 54:52.396
Plus, I really love jet skis.
[exclaims]

54:52.431 --> 54:54.530
Yeah! Jet skis.
Hey, yeah, so do we.

54:54.565 --> 54:56.092
Gotta have money for that.
Yeah.

54:56.127 --> 54:58.226
Oh, perfect!

54:58.261 --> 55:00.833
We've prepared
some morning cordials I think
will be to your liking.

55:00.868 --> 55:02.967
Bloody Mary, yes, please.

55:03.002 --> 55:05.233
This will help
make this place less weird.

55:05.268 --> 55:06.707
Thank you.
No offense.

55:07.974 --> 55:10.271
Mmm.
God bless vodka.
Mmm.

55:10.306 --> 55:11.778
Don't thank God,
thank K.A.R.E.N.

55:11.813 --> 55:13.648
She scanned your bodies
during your slumber,

55:13.683 --> 55:15.452
so she knows
just what you like.

55:15.487 --> 55:16.816
Is that why I had a boner?
Wait.

55:16.851 --> 55:19.621
What do you mean
she scanned our bodies?

55:19.656 --> 55:23.284
Where are Shelly and-- and Doc?
We really should
probably get goin'.

55:23.319 --> 55:24.351
Yeah.

55:24.386 --> 55:26.463
Who?
Shelly and Doc.

55:26.498 --> 55:30.192
Our f-- Uh...
Swollen Tick and Beef Chimi.

55:30.227 --> 55:32.194
The fake doctor and the guy
who looks like Gargamel?

55:32.229 --> 55:35.164
I assure you, everyone
who is meant to be here is here.

55:36.035 --> 55:37.441
Now please,

55:37.476 --> 55:40.202
help yourselves and drink up.

55:40.237 --> 55:42.171
It will help you, I promise.

55:42.206 --> 55:45.042
I will leave you to prepare
for the morning commitment.

55:46.375 --> 55:47.814
I will see you there.

55:49.081 --> 55:50.718
See you there.

55:50.753 --> 55:52.720
Morning commitment?
Does that mean
they're here?

55:52.755 --> 55:55.217
I'm gonna--
I'm gonna go find them.
This is so weird.

56:05.702 --> 56:06.899
Doc, Shelly.

56:07.572 --> 56:09.066
Time to get up.

56:09.101 --> 56:10.837
We got breakfast, buddy.

56:10.872 --> 56:12.201
[doorknob rattles]

56:14.777 --> 56:16.744
Doc, Shelly.

56:16.779 --> 56:18.878
Let's go.
We got Bloody Marys. Let's go.

56:18.913 --> 56:20.451

56:25.623 --> 56:30.384

56:54.652 --> 56:56.443
I didn't find 'em.

56:56.478 --> 56:59.248
And honestly, this place
is just creepin' me out.

56:59.283 --> 57:01.217
I'm gonna go outside
and try to call 'em.

57:01.252 --> 57:03.384
[English accent]
That's a good idea, Gary.

57:03.419 --> 57:08.422
I've had three Bloody Marys,
and they're pure magic.

57:08.457 --> 57:09.764
What? How-- [sighs]

57:09.799 --> 57:11.733
And they are powerful.

57:11.768 --> 57:13.427
Okay.
I feel like really,
really good.

57:13.462 --> 57:15.396
I-- I think we probably
shouldn't split up.

57:15.431 --> 57:16.870
Come with me.
[normal voice] Okay.

57:16.905 --> 57:18.674
Come on.
No. Leave it.

57:19.303 --> 57:20.643
Okay.

[breathing heavily]

57:53.645 --> 57:55.205
Okay.

57:55.240 --> 57:57.174
There's a chicken in my bed.

57:59.013 --> 58:01.310

There was a chicken in my bed.

58:01.345 --> 58:03.444
[Shelly] Speak of the devil.

58:03.479 --> 58:06.282
Well, if he's a devil,
then sign me up for hell,
you know what I mean?

58:06.317 --> 58:08.020
Where's Bob?
Where's Bender?

58:08.055 --> 58:09.384
Where the fuck are we?

58:09.419 --> 58:11.628
Remember, you're
at the Panty Hamster.

58:11.663 --> 58:15.863
We like to think
it marries old-world charm
with modern conveniences.

58:15.898 --> 58:18.228
Sit down now.
I'll get you a plate.

58:19.297 --> 58:20.329
You earned it.

58:20.364 --> 58:21.330
Oh, hell, yeah.

58:22.674 --> 58:24.531
Please tell me
I didn't fuck a chicken.

58:24.566 --> 58:25.939
Oh, you don't remember?

58:25.974 --> 58:27.402
I don't remember shit
from last night.

58:27.437 --> 58:28.876
Oh, man,
how's your jaw?

58:28.911 --> 58:30.581
I think it was, um,

58:30.616 --> 58:33.045
"The bigger the FUPA,
the sweeter the chalupa,
Shelly."

58:33.080 --> 58:34.684
That's what you kept sayin'
last night.

58:36.886 --> 58:38.853
No.
You were all smiles.

58:38.888 --> 58:41.152
There you go, big guy.
[chuckles]

58:42.122 --> 58:43.825
Maybe you're not hungry.

58:43.860 --> 58:45.827
After all, you got
a belly full of pussy.

58:45.862 --> 58:47.928
[laughing]

58:47.963 --> 58:51.063
You know,
most men don't like to
kiss a Wookiee that much,

58:51.098 --> 58:53.769
but like I was tellin'
your friend here,

58:53.804 --> 58:56.563
you were like
Pac-Man down there.

Hey.

Hey, come on. You okay?

Hey, hey, hey.
[shouts] Oh.

Oh, shit.

Come on.
Come on, come here.

Just in time for the wokening.

01:00:01.597 --> 01:00:03.267
I knew you'd find your own way.

01:00:03.302 --> 01:00:06.908
Yeah, uh, we're actually
looking for our friends.

01:00:06.943 --> 01:00:09.845
Maybe you could give us
a drive into town, or--
or I don't know.

01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:11.275
Point us
in the right direction?

01:00:11.310 --> 01:00:13.541
Soon, my antique warriors.

01:00:13.576 --> 01:00:16.918
Everything comes in time,
but right now
is the time to evolve.

01:00:17.822 --> 01:00:18.854
You'll see.

01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:22.583
I don't wanna evolve.
I wanna go home.

01:00:24.488 --> 01:00:26.928
Yo, Doc and Shelly
are probably down there.
We should just go.

01:00:26.963 --> 01:00:29.194
You think?
Okay, let's go.

01:00:30.329 --> 01:00:31.361
Yeah.

01:00:31.968 --> 01:00:33.297
What?

01:00:33.332 --> 01:00:35.805
You're fuckin'...
What are you...

01:00:38.601 --> 01:00:41.745
[muffled thumping, moaning]

01:00:47.049 --> 01:00:49.148
Finish already.

01:00:51.889 --> 01:00:52.954
Geez.

01:00:52.989 --> 01:00:54.483
[chicken clucking]

01:00:54.518 --> 01:00:56.958
That's weird.
Come on, get. Get.

Chick digs you, buddy.

01:00:58.687 --> 01:01:01.259
Did you even call Bob
and see if he could
come get us?

01:01:01.294 --> 01:01:03.492
I called both of them.
Went straight to voice mail.

01:01:03.527 --> 01:01:05.098
[sighs]

01:01:05.133 --> 01:01:06.869
[door closes]
How'd they--

01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:09.872
You okay?

01:01:09.907 --> 01:01:11.368
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:01:18.850 --> 01:01:21.345

Oh!

01:01:24.548 --> 01:01:25.580
Okay.

Zane.

01:01:29.025 --> 01:01:30.893
What is Zane
gonna possibly do?

01:01:30.928 --> 01:01:32.862
Nothin'. But he's
gonna love this story.

01:01:34.261 --> 01:01:36.525
Oh, thank God.
What happened to your nose?

01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:39.000
Are you guys okay?
I've been worried sick
about you.

01:01:54.413 --> 01:01:56.017
Open up the door.
Oh, my God.

01:10:23.493 --> 01:10:25.625
Is this you?
Is this you and Shelly?
What?

01:10:25.660 --> 01:10:28.595
You did all this
to fuck with me?
What? No! You're trippin'!

01:10:28.630 --> 01:10:30.256
We're both high right now.
I know.

01:10:30.291 --> 01:10:32.093
Of course
I wouldn't do that.

01:10:32.128 --> 01:10:34.931
Ow! Damn it!
Would you chill out?

01:10:34.966 --> 01:10:36.735
[Bender] Ow. Fuck.
Hey.

01:10:36.770 --> 01:10:39.507
There are two of us,
and there are, like,
a hundred of them.

01:10:39.542 --> 01:10:44.380
Okay, so we just focus
on how the hell
we get outta here.

01:10:44.415 --> 01:10:47.878
[Phoenix over PA]
<i>Welcome, Bobfather</i>

01:10:47.913 --> 01:10:49.880

01:10:49.915 --> 01:10:54.280
<i>You, like so many,</i>
<i>have been blind to the truth.</i>

01:10:54.315 --> 01:10:57.954
<i>Blinded by racism, sexism</i>

01:10:57.989 --> 01:11:00.726
<i>and other isms, all of them.</i>

01:11:00.761 --> 01:11:02.629
Oh, come on, Phoenix.
I don't have any isms!

01:11:02.664 --> 01:11:04.334
We don't have time
for this!

01:11:04.369 --> 01:11:06.897
Please, just let us
the fuck out of here!

01:11:06.932 --> 01:11:08.129
[groans]

01:11:08.164 --> 01:11:10.065
I have to
use the bathroom.

01:11:10.100 --> 01:11:12.639
I have bad diarrhea.
I've gotta go now.
Can you open the door?

01:11:12.674 --> 01:11:14.102
I'll go right here.

01:11:14.137 --> 01:11:15.939
[Bob]<i> He'll do it!</i>
No.

01:11:15.974 --> 01:11:17.479
I'm gonna go potty.
I'll go right now.
Take it easy.

01:11:17.514 --> 01:11:19.679
He'll fuckin' do it!
Let us out!

01:11:19.714 --> 01:11:22.352
He will go right there.
Don't do it.
He'll go right there!

01:11:22.387 --> 01:11:26.081
[Phoenix]<i> Trigger warning!</i>
<i>Think before you speak.</i>
<i>You have 30 minutes.</i>

01:11:26.116 --> 01:11:29.920
Thirty minutes?
What do we do for 30 minutes?
Can I get a cocktail then?

01:11:29.955 --> 01:11:32.956
No, no, no, no.
She said it's a game.
We gotta play the game.

01:11:32.991 --> 01:11:34.991
It's what we do, right?

01:11:35.026 --> 01:11:36.366
It's a puzzle.

01:11:36.401 --> 01:11:38.500
Wait, wait,
it's an escape room.

01:11:38.535 --> 01:11:41.327
Do you know anything
about escape rooms?
Uh, no.

01:11:41.362 --> 01:11:43.032
What are you,
fuckin' retarded?

01:11:43.067 --> 01:11:44.638
[alarm blares]

01:11:44.673 --> 01:11:46.167
Oh, shit.
Is that 'cause
I said "retarded"?

01:11:46.202 --> 01:11:48.268
[alarm blares]
Would you stop
saying that word?

01:11:48.303 --> 01:11:50.138
I know.
You can't say
that word anymore!

01:11:50.173 --> 01:11:51.414
I know. I'm sorry.
Jesus.

01:11:51.449 --> 01:11:52.679
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it.

01:11:52.714 --> 01:11:54.846
I was born in 1976.

01:11:54.881 --> 01:11:57.354
Start lookin' for things.
Look for clues,
look for anything.

01:11:57.917 --> 01:11:59.389
[horn toots]

01:12:03.923 --> 01:12:05.362
You see anything?

01:12:09.896 --> 01:12:11.995

<i>I'll repeat your first clue.</i>

Trigger warning:
Think before you speak.

01:12:16.639 --> 01:12:18.540
I never do that.
Is that even a clue?

01:12:18.575 --> 01:12:20.806
I don't know.
[Phoenix]
<i>Trigger. What has triggers?</i>

01:12:20.841 --> 01:12:23.303
<i>Was he dropped as a baby?</i>
I heard that.

01:12:23.338 --> 01:12:24.711
Oh, so-- Um...

01:12:27.408 --> 01:12:29.617
I think I found
what we're lookin' for.
Oh!

01:12:29.652 --> 01:12:31.982
Bob, shoot the door.
We'll shoot our way out.

01:12:32.017 --> 01:12:34.017
Let me just...
Wait,
what are you doing?

01:12:34.052 --> 01:12:36.492
[door powering down]
[gasps]

01:12:36.527 --> 01:12:37.427
We did it!

01:12:37.462 --> 01:12:39.220
We did it!
We?

01:12:39.255 --> 01:12:42.223
You did it, Bob. Sorry.
Yeah, you did it,
so you go first.

01:12:42.258 --> 01:12:44.500
Hey. Uh-uh-uh.
Go, Bob.

01:12:48.902 --> 01:12:50.099
Whoa.

[gasps]

01:12:54.105 --> 01:12:56.644
Shit!
Now what do we do?

01:12:56.679 --> 01:12:58.338
Uh...

01:12:58.373 --> 01:12:59.482
I don't know.

01:12:59.517 --> 01:13:00.912
Do we have to find
another gun?

01:13:06.887 --> 01:13:10.152
Yeah, I knew it wasn't
gonna be that easy.
You wanna play?

01:13:10.187 --> 01:13:12.660
Yeah, I wanna play.
You wanna play? Let's play!

01:13:23.838 --> 01:13:26.267
No, no, no. Bob, Bob, Bob.
Let me do this one.

01:13:26.302 --> 01:13:28.236
What?
Let me do this one.
Trust me.

01:13:28.271 --> 01:13:31.173
You're a privileged white male.
What? You're white.

01:13:31.208 --> 01:13:33.439
Yeah, but, Bob,
you're really white.

01:13:33.474 --> 01:13:34.748
[scoffs]

01:13:35.883 --> 01:13:37.652
Okay. Okay.

01:13:38.952 --> 01:13:39.984
Okay.

01:13:45.420 --> 01:13:46.991
Oh.
Look at him.

01:13:53.637 --> 01:13:54.768
Huh.

01:14:04.373 --> 01:14:05.911

01:14:07.277 --> 01:14:08.584
All right.

01:14:08.619 --> 01:14:10.443
Wait, no, you go first.
Huh? Okay, fine.

01:14:11.281 --> 01:14:13.149
[Bender] Is it bad?

01:14:13.184 --> 01:14:15.382
[Doc sighing]
Dude, we're gonna need
to take a break, man.

01:14:15.417 --> 01:14:18.924
It's hot as shit out here.
Every muscle in my body
is hurting.

01:14:18.959 --> 01:14:20.728
[sighs]
Fuck, I'm so hungry.

01:14:20.763 --> 01:14:24.798
I could totally
crush a sandwich.
Yeah.

01:14:24.833 --> 01:14:27.262
Chicken sandwich.
Oh, yeah.

01:14:28.870 --> 01:14:30.606
Don't even think about it.
What?

01:14:30.641 --> 01:14:32.905
Any chicken sandwich.
No particular chicken.

01:14:32.940 --> 01:14:35.578
No. No. No.
Get that outta your head.

01:14:35.613 --> 01:14:38.944
Never, ever, ever would I
ever even think about
doin' anything like that.

01:14:38.979 --> 01:14:40.011
All right.

01:14:42.510 --> 01:14:43.784

I'm thinkin' about it.

01:14:44.985 --> 01:14:46.050

This is it, Bob.
This is where we die.

<i>Things that were funny before</i>

<i>Now we know that real eyes</i>
<i>realize real lies.</i>

I don't-- What?

01:15:32.065 --> 01:15:33.229
Is that a clue?

I'm sorry,
can you repeat that?

01:15:35.266 --> 01:15:37.640
Don't worry about it.
Let's just see
if you can evolve.

01:15:37.675 --> 01:15:40.973
Evolve?
[Phoenix]<i> You each get</i>
<i>one turn to answer correctly.</i>

01:15:41.008 --> 01:15:42.139
<i>We'll start with you, Bob.</i>

Come on, Bob.

01:15:43.505 --> 01:15:45.439
[Phoenix]
<i>What is wrong with this image?</i>

01:15:49.852 --> 01:15:51.819
[Bender] Bob, you got this.
[Bob] Wha--

01:15:51.854 --> 01:15:55.218
That's clearly a man
trying to play
in the women's league.

01:15:55.253 --> 01:15:57.583
So that's wrong.
It's unfair for the other team.

01:15:57.618 --> 01:15:58.628
[grunts]

01:15:58.663 --> 01:16:00.124

Ouch.

01:16:00.896 --> 01:16:02.258
Are you all right?
[groans]

01:16:04.097 --> 01:16:05.360
The fuck was that?

01:16:05.395 --> 01:16:06.669
Did that hurt?
Uh-huh.

<i>Okay, Broken Man. Your turn.</i>

Uh, that guy's dick
is about to fall out
of his shorts,

01:16:15.042 --> 01:16:16.712
and nobody wants
to see that,
that's gross.

01:16:16.747 --> 01:16:17.911
Right.
Did I win?

01:16:17.946 --> 01:16:19.011
[Phoenix]
<i>Almost, but no.</i>

01:16:19.046 --> 01:16:20.342
[groans]

01:16:20.377 --> 01:16:23.378
Fuck, that hurts! Ow.
You okay?

01:16:23.413 --> 01:16:28.823
[Phoenix]<i> The correct answer is</i>
<i>that the outfits these female</i>
<i>athletes are forced to wear</i>

01:16:28.858 --> 01:16:30.957
<i>over-sexualize them.</i>
Come on.

01:16:30.992 --> 01:16:33.190
That's what's wrong
with this photo?

01:16:33.225 --> 01:16:36.666
[Phoenix]<i> Next:</i>
<i>Which photo accurately</i>
<i>depicts feminism?</i>

01:16:39.429 --> 01:16:41.704
Uh...
Come on.

01:16:41.739 --> 01:16:42.969
Number two.

01:16:44.269 --> 01:16:47.270
Embracing her feminine form.

01:16:47.305 --> 01:16:49.943
And-- [groaning]

01:16:51.474 --> 01:16:53.573
You all right?

01:16:53.608 --> 01:16:55.311
It's the first one, right?

01:16:55.346 --> 01:16:58.083
The chick with the body hair
turned her armpits into vaginas

01:16:58.118 --> 01:16:59.821
to give her more powers
as a woman!

01:16:59.856 --> 01:17:02.054
No, no.
Ow! [groans]

01:17:02.089 --> 01:17:04.122
Yeah, you kinda
deserved that one.

01:17:04.157 --> 01:17:07.389
[Phoenix]
<i>Wrong. They are both examples</i>
<i>of what feminism can look like.</i>

01:17:07.424 --> 01:17:08.731
So we were both right!

01:17:08.766 --> 01:17:10.832
[Phoenix]
<i>No. Both wrong.</i>

01:17:10.867 --> 01:17:13.593
<i>Next one.</i>
<i>What is wrong with this image?</i>

01:17:14.596 --> 01:17:15.969
[Bob] Uh...

01:17:17.401 --> 01:17:21.172
Gender reveal parties
are bad for the environment.

01:17:22.274 --> 01:17:24.846
Turtles and baby seals
and shit will eat that.

01:17:24.881 --> 01:17:27.783
Yeah, that's good.
You shouldn't brag
about having kids online

01:17:27.818 --> 01:17:29.312
because some people
can't have kids.

01:17:29.347 --> 01:17:30.786
Yes.
Yes.

01:17:30.821 --> 01:17:31.919
Oh, my God!

01:17:31.954 --> 01:17:33.415
[grunts] Come on.
Oh!

01:17:33.450 --> 01:17:36.352
[screams]

01:17:36.387 --> 01:17:38.189
[gasps] Ow!

01:17:38.224 --> 01:17:39.289
Three?

01:17:40.193 --> 01:17:41.995
Oh, my God.
Three?

01:17:45.330 --> 01:17:47.836
Okay, all right. Here it is.
We're gettin' out of here.

01:17:47.871 --> 01:17:52.434
The parents,
they shouldn't decide
their boy or girlness,

01:17:52.469 --> 01:17:53.776
or whatever it's called,

01:17:53.811 --> 01:17:56.944
the gender re-- re--
ration, or whatever.

01:17:56.979 --> 01:17:59.177
The kids should decide
their own gender.

01:17:59.212 --> 01:18:01.047
What? Nah.
[groans]

01:18:01.082 --> 01:18:03.709
[Phoenix]<i> Uh, actually,</i>
<i>that was right. My bad.</i>

01:18:03.744 --> 01:18:05.447
Yeah,
I know I was right!

01:18:05.482 --> 01:18:07.680
You don't cancel me,
I cancel you!

01:18:07.715 --> 01:18:08.758
[groans]

01:18:08.793 --> 01:18:11.552
Again! Again!

01:18:11.587 --> 01:18:14.225
Again!
Oh! [laughs]

01:18:14.260 --> 01:18:16.524
I love you, man.
I'm not afraid of you!

01:18:16.559 --> 01:18:17.998
That was amazing.

01:18:18.033 --> 01:18:21.727
[panting]

01:18:21.762 --> 01:18:23.333
So, are we done?

01:18:26.272 --> 01:18:28.745
[grunting] Come on!

01:18:31.882 --> 01:18:33.948
Thank you.

01:18:33.983 --> 01:18:36.709
Now take off the straps.
We won. Let us go.

01:18:42.684 --> 01:18:43.892
You didn't win.

01:18:45.291 --> 01:18:46.829
No, we did win.

01:18:46.864 --> 01:18:48.897
We beat the clock.
We beat the game. We won.

01:18:48.932 --> 01:18:50.624
You didn't simply win.

01:18:51.726 --> 01:18:53.363
You learned, didn't you?

01:18:53.398 --> 01:18:55.838
Yeah, sure, whatever.
Let us go.

01:18:55.873 --> 01:19:01.305
You see, I've always had
terrible taste in men, Bob.

01:19:01.340 --> 01:19:03.406
No matter how evolved
I've become,
