01:11.354 --> 01:12.856
WHAT ARE YOU DOING,
RAPHAEL?

01:15.528 --> 01:18.363
TAKING A TRIP
DOWN MEMORY LANE, I SEE.

01:18.364 --> 01:21.200
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE SO SENTIMENTAL.

01:21.201 --> 01:24.038
ME SENTIMENTAL?
HEH. NO WAY.

01:24.039 --> 01:26.808
I JUST OPENED
THAT PHOTO ALBUM
BY ACCIDENT.

01:26.809 --> 01:29.813
WOW! REMEMBER
THESE GUYS?

01:29.814 --> 01:32.315
OH, YEAH, THE FROGS.

01:32.316 --> 01:35.219
THEY WERE
MONDO COOL AMIGOS.

01:35.220 --> 01:37.155
HEY, REMEMBER
HOW KRANG SENT

01:37.156 --> 01:39.157
THAT CAN OF MUTIGEN
TO THE WRONG PLACE?

01:39.158 --> 01:43.230
YEAH, AND IT TURNED THOSE
SWAMP FROGS INTO PUNK FROGS.

01:43.231 --> 01:46.001
GATOR HUNTING'S SLIM
IN THIS SWAMP, PA.

01:46.002 --> 01:48.972
MAYBE WE BETTER
GO BACK TO LOUISIANA.

01:48.973 --> 01:50.840
THAT OLD LEATHERHEAD'S

01:50.841 --> 01:52.743
SOMEWHERE
IN THESE WATERS, BOY.

01:52.744 --> 01:55.413
HE'S THE BIGGEST
GATOR THAT EVER
GOT BORN.

01:55.414 --> 01:57.650
I'M NOT LEAVING
TILL I CATCH HIM.

02:02.992 --> 02:04.593
IT'S LEATHERHEAD!

02:07.699 --> 02:10.435
W-WHERE WE
HEADED NOW, PA?

02:10.436 --> 02:14.439
WHOA! BACK
TO LOUISIANA,
LICKETY-SPLIT!

02:20.649 --> 02:23.718
I WONDER WHAT
EVER HAPPENED
TO THE FROGS.

02:23.719 --> 02:27.725
WELL, THEY'RE
PROBABLY HAVING
A TRULY BODACIOUS TIME

02:27.726 --> 02:30.228
IN THOSE PEACEFUL
FLORIDA SWAMPS.

02:31.831 --> 02:34.600
NO USE SKEDADDLING,
FROGS!

02:34.601 --> 02:38.106
YOU DON'T BE ESCAPING
FROM OLD LEATHERHEAD.

02:38.107 --> 02:41.543
FASTER, FELLOWS.
HE'S RIGHT ON
OUR TAILS!

02:41.544 --> 02:43.512
BUT THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

02:43.513 --> 02:44.881
WE LOST THEM THINGS

02:44.882 --> 02:47.250
WHEN WE WAS
ITTY BITTY TADPOLES.

02:47.251 --> 02:50.789
IT'S JUST A FIGURE
OF SPEECH, GENGHIS.

02:52.492 --> 02:55.228
WHY ARE YOU STOPPING,
NAPOLEON?

02:55.229 --> 02:58.933
THERE COMES A TIME
WHEN YOU'VE GOT
TO STOP RUNNING.

02:58.934 --> 03:01.870
BUT WHY DID YOU
HAVE TO PICK THIS TIME?

03:01.871 --> 03:04.107
'CAUSE A FROG'S
GOT TO DO

03:04.108 --> 03:06.177
WHAT A FROG'S GOT TO DO.

03:07.313 --> 03:11.117
YOU FROGS
BE PLENTY PITIFUL.

03:15.825 --> 03:18.795
I SHOWED THEM FROGS,
BY GUMBO.

03:18.796 --> 03:21.765
THINGS DON'T LOOK
SO GOOD, DO THEY?

03:21.766 --> 03:23.835
WE AIN'T
GIVING UP YET.

03:26.973 --> 03:29.709
HEY! WHAT IS THIS?

03:29.710 --> 03:32.479
GOOD SHOOTIN',
RASPUTIN.

03:32.480 --> 03:35.050
YEAH. THAT OUGHT
TO HOLD HIM.

03:35.051 --> 03:38.088
IT OUGHT TO...
BUT IT WON'T!

03:38.089 --> 03:40.958
I GUARANTEE.

03:40.959 --> 03:44.796
FELLAS, IT'S TIME
TO REGROUP AND RETHINK.

03:44.797 --> 03:48.568
OK, BUT FIRST
LET'S RETREAT!

03:48.569 --> 03:52.073
YOU DON'T GET SO EASY,
YOU BETCHA.

03:52.074 --> 03:52.941
NO!

03:52.942 --> 03:54.343
OH, GOSH!

03:54.344 --> 03:56.545
WHAT'S PLAN B?

03:56.546 --> 03:59.416
THIS SURE BE
SOME GOOD LIFE.

04:00.819 --> 04:03.689
THIS SURE IS
HARD WORK.

04:03.690 --> 04:05.758
BETTER YOU GET
USED TO IT.

04:05.759 --> 04:08.662
YOU GONNA BE
MY SLAVES FOR LIFE.

04:08.663 --> 04:12.334
AND US GATORS LIVE
FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS, YEAH.

04:13.337 --> 04:16.839
AND IN CASE
YOU FIGURE ON ESCAPING,

04:16.841 --> 04:20.445
MY CRAWFISH CLAMPS
MAKE SURE YOU DON'T.

04:20.446 --> 04:22.948
NOW, I'M GOING TO CATCH
ME 40 WINKS,

04:22.949 --> 04:25.418
SO, UH, KEEP
IT QUIET, HEAR?

04:25.419 --> 04:27.321
IT APPEARS WE'RE GOING
TO NEED SOME HELP

04:27.322 --> 04:28.589
DEALING
WITH LEATHERHEAD.

04:28.590 --> 04:30.759
AND I KNOW JUST
WHERE TO GET IT.

04:30.760 --> 04:33.763
WHO YOU GOING
TO CALL, GATORBUSTERS?

04:33.764 --> 04:35.933
NO. BETTER YET.

04:35.934 --> 04:38.403
THERE'S NOTHING LIKE
A TRIP DOWN MEMORY LANE

04:38.404 --> 04:40.205
TO WORK UP AN APPETITE.

04:40.206 --> 04:42.642
I CAN DIG THAT,
DONATELLO.

04:42.643 --> 04:44.278
ANYONE FOR PIZZA?

04:45.881 --> 04:47.882
LEONARDO HERE.
WHO'S THIS?

04:47.883 --> 04:49.718
<i>THIS HERE'S
RASPUTIN.</i>

04:49.719 --> 04:51.988
HEY, THE FROGS.

04:51.989 --> 04:54.458
WE WERE JUST
TALKING ABOUT
YOU FELLAS.

04:54.459 --> 04:55.993
WE KINDA NEED
YOUR HELP.

04:55.994 --> 04:58.030
HOW FAST CAN YOU
GET TO FLORIDA?

04:58.031 --> 04:59.164
WHERE WE GOING
TO STAY

04:59.165 --> 05:00.633
WHILE WE'RE
IN FLORIDA?

05:00.634 --> 05:02.469
HEY, NO PROBLEMO.

05:02.470 --> 05:05.206
APRIL AND IRMA ARE
DOWN THERE ON VACATION.

05:05.207 --> 05:07.108
WE COULD CRASH
WITH THEM.

05:07.109 --> 05:09.912
SEE HOW CONVENIENTLY
EVERYTHING'S WORKING OUT?

05:09.913 --> 05:11.681
WE WON'T HAVE
A BIT OF TROUBLE.

05:15.020 --> 05:17.522
MY TRACKING EQUIPMENT
TELLS ME

05:17.523 --> 05:20.327
THE TURTLES ARE
UP TO SOMETHING.

05:22.030 --> 05:25.533
SO THIS IS WHAT
THE FLORIDA SWAMP
LOOKS LIKE.

05:25.534 --> 05:28.204
WAIT. WHAT'S THIS?

05:32.244 --> 05:35.514
LOOK AT THE SIZE
OF THAT CREATURE

05:35.515 --> 05:38.051
AND THOSE
PESKY P-FROGS.

05:38.052 --> 05:40.688
THAT THING
HAS CAPTURED THEM.

05:40.689 --> 05:44.059
OOH, SHREDDER, I WANT YOU
TO GO TO THE SURFACE

05:44.060 --> 05:47.030
AND ENLIST THE HELP
OF THAT BEAST.

05:47.031 --> 05:49.700
A HALF ALLIGATOR,
HALF MAN?

05:49.701 --> 05:52.537
WHY DO WE NEED
WITH FREAK LIKE THAT?

05:53.572 --> 05:56.743
IF HE CAN HANDLE
FOUR ARMED FROGS,

05:56.744 --> 05:58.511
HE CAN CERTAINLY
HELP US

05:58.512 --> 06:01.249
DESTROY THOSE
BOTHERSOME SHELLBACKS.

06:01.250 --> 06:06.590
NOW, GO, AND DON'T COME BACK
WITHOUT THAT MUTANT.

06:06.591 --> 06:10.128
JUST WHAT WE NEED--
MORE OF THEM.

06:13.033 --> 06:16.904
SO YOU SEE, WE'RE HERE
TO HELP OUT THE FROGS.

06:16.905 --> 06:19.374
COME ON. I LEFT
THE OTHER GUYS
BACK AT THE SWAMP.

06:19.375 --> 06:22.378
HOLD ON.
DID YOU SAY SWAMP?

06:22.379 --> 06:23.113
WELL, YEAH.

06:23.114 --> 06:24.848
THAT'S WHERE
THE FROGS LIVE.

06:24.849 --> 06:26.383
ICKY THINGS?

06:29.122 --> 06:30.790
I JUST REMEMBERED
A NAIL APPOINTMENT

06:30.791 --> 06:33.226
BACK IN THE CITY.
CIAO!

06:33.227 --> 06:35.897
STILL NO SIGN
OF THE FROGS

06:35.898 --> 06:40.235
OR OF THIS LEATHERHEAD
CHARACTER, EITHER.

06:42.306 --> 06:45.108
LEONARDO,
TRY TO CUT US FREE.

06:45.109 --> 06:48.346
I CAN'T REACH
MY SWORD.

06:48.347 --> 06:52.153
WHAT YOU BUMS DOING
HERE IN MY SWAMP?

06:52.154 --> 06:54.756
UH, NOTHING MUCH.
JUST HANGING AROUND.

06:54.757 --> 06:56.658
YOU COME IN HERE,

06:56.659 --> 06:59.261
BUT YOU AIN'T
NEVER GOING TO LEAVE.

06:59.262 --> 07:01.598
I GUARANTEE.

07:09.510 --> 07:12.012
I NEVER THOUGHT
IT WOULD END LIKE THIS--

07:12.013 --> 07:13.213
HANGING IN A NET,

07:13.214 --> 07:15.651
CAPTURED
BY A MUTANT ALLIGATOR.

07:15.652 --> 07:16.552
YEAH.

07:16.553 --> 07:18.421
LIFE SURE TAKES FUNNY
TWISTS, DOESN'T IT?

07:19.590 --> 07:20.958
LOOKS LIKE OUR PALS
THE TURTLES

07:20.959 --> 07:22.327
ARE IN HOT GUMBO.

07:22.328 --> 07:24.831
ONE OF US REALLY
OUGHT TO DO SOMETHING.

07:24.832 --> 07:27.467
I GUESS IT'S MY TURN.

07:31.907 --> 07:34.910
GET OFF OF ME, AND
I'LL FIX YOU GOOD.

07:34.911 --> 07:37.447
WHICH IS WHY
WE'RE NOT ABOUT TO.

07:37.448 --> 07:40.752
HOWDY, TURTLES.
WELCOME TO THE SWAMP.

07:40.753 --> 07:42.588
YOU FELLAS ALL RIGHT?

07:42.589 --> 07:44.424
NEVER BEEN BETTER.

07:44.425 --> 07:47.261
OHH! I GET MY CLAWS
ON YOU,

07:47.262 --> 07:49.564
I MAKE YOU
INTO SWAMP STEW!

07:49.565 --> 07:52.968
I DOUBT IF YOU'LL
GET THE CHANCE,
MY SCALY FRIEND.

07:58.878 --> 08:01.580
FROGS, THIS IS
OUR FRIEND APRIL.

08:01.581 --> 08:02.682
HEY, PLEASURE, MA'AM.

08:02.683 --> 08:03.917
PLEASED
TO MEET YOU.

08:03.918 --> 08:06.754
ARE THINGS ALWAYS
THIS EXCITING AROUND
THESE PARTS?

08:06.755 --> 08:09.457
ONLY SINCE THIS NO GOOD
LEATHERHEAD SHOWED UP.

08:09.458 --> 08:12.962
HOW DO YOU SUPPOSE
A CREATURE LIKE THAT
CAME ABOUT?

08:12.963 --> 08:15.299
PROBABLY FROM SOME
OF KRANG'S MUTIGEN

08:15.300 --> 08:16.901
THAT SEEPED
INTO THE SWAMP.

08:16.902 --> 08:18.804
BUT WE'VE GOT
A BIGGER PROBLEM.

08:18.805 --> 08:19.839
NOW THAT WE'VE GOT HIM,

08:19.840 --> 08:21.107
WHAT DO WE DO WITH HIM?

08:31.254 --> 08:34.958
ROCK STEADY,
YOU MUTANT
MUTTONHEAD.

08:34.960 --> 08:37.763
YOU MISSED
THE COORDINATES
COMPLETELY.

08:37.764 --> 08:40.032
OH, WHAT'S
THE DIFFERENCE, BOSS?

08:40.033 --> 08:43.437
A SWAMP IS A SWAMP.

08:43.438 --> 08:45.039
BEES!

08:54.152 --> 08:57.557
NOW WHAT DO YOU HAVE
TO SAY FOR YOURSELF?

08:57.558 --> 09:00.995
HOW ABOUT OOPS?

09:00.996 --> 09:04.099
YOU ALWAYS DID HAVE
A WAY WITH WORDS.

09:04.100 --> 09:06.035
WHEN WE REACH
THE EDGE OF THE SWAMP,

09:06.036 --> 09:08.839
WE CAN TURN LEATHERHEAD
OVER TO THE AUTHORITIES.

09:08.840 --> 09:10.976
HOW MUCH FARTHER
IS IT?

09:10.977 --> 09:13.912
'BOUT 12 MILES
AS THE CROW FLIES.

09:13.913 --> 09:17.384
I DON'T KNOW HOW FAR
IT IS AS THE FROG HOPS.

09:17.385 --> 09:19.386
UGH. I'M BUSHED.

09:19.387 --> 09:21.155
LET'S TAKE A BREAK.

09:22.558 --> 09:26.396
WE'VE BEEN TRUDGING
THROUGH THIS SWAMP
FOR HOURS NOW.

09:26.397 --> 09:28.532
AND ALL WE'VE GOT
TO SHOW FOR IT

09:28.533 --> 09:31.036
ARE BLISTERS
THE SIZE OF
RHODE ISLAND.

09:31.037 --> 09:35.743
YEAH, AND MOSQUITOES
THE SIZE OF 747s.

09:35.744 --> 09:37.844
SHUCKS,
I'LL HANDLE THAT.

09:39.949 --> 09:43.052
MMM. THAT SURE
HIT THE SPOT.

09:43.053 --> 09:46.257
EW, HOW COULD
YOU DO THAT?

09:46.258 --> 09:47.892
YOU'RE RIGHT, MISS APRIL.

09:47.893 --> 09:50.028
I SHOULD'VE OFFERED
THE TWO OF YOU SOME.

09:50.029 --> 09:54.468
FORGET IT, DUDE.
NOT EVEN ON A PIZZA.

09:56.638 --> 09:59.140
YES, KRANG,
WHAT IS IT?

09:59.141 --> 10:02.880
<i>WELL, WHAT'S
THE DELAY?</i>

10:02.881 --> 10:04.047
HAVEN'T YOU
LOCATED

10:04.048 --> 10:06.451
THAT MUTANT
ALLIGATOR YET?

10:06.452 --> 10:09.321
WILL YOU
GET OFF MY BACK?

10:09.322 --> 10:13.628
I'VE GOT
ENOUGH ANNOYING PESTS
BUGGING ME ALREADY.

10:13.629 --> 10:16.998
OOH. TEMPER, TEMPER,
SHREDDER.

10:16.999 --> 10:19.602
JUST KEEP AN EYE OUT
FOR THAT CREATURE.

10:19.603 --> 10:22.439
MY SCANNERS SHOW
HE'S IN THE AREA.

10:22.440 --> 10:25.610
HEY, BOSS,
LOOK WHAT I FOUND.

10:25.611 --> 10:27.813
IT'S THE TURTLES.

10:27.814 --> 10:30.617
AND A WHOLE BUNCH
OF FROGS.

10:30.618 --> 10:33.888
AND THEY'VE GOT
THAT MUTANT ALLIGATOR
WITH THEM.

10:33.889 --> 10:36.391
THIS IS
OUR LUCKY DAY--

10:36.392 --> 10:39.262
WE CAPTURE
TWO PRIZES
INSTEAD OF ONE.

10:40.397 --> 10:42.533
YOU WANT WE SHOULD
RUSH THEM, BOSS?

10:42.534 --> 10:43.769
NOT YET.

10:43.770 --> 10:44.803
WE'LL FOLLOW THEM

10:44.804 --> 10:46.605
AND SEE WHAT
THEY'RE UP TO.

10:48.241 --> 10:51.244
HEY, WHAT YOU SAY
WE STOP HERE?

10:51.245 --> 10:54.650
MY FEETS,
THEY ARE PLENTY TIRED.

10:54.651 --> 10:58.055
HMM. MAYBE WE SHOULD
TAKE A BREAK.

10:58.056 --> 10:59.489
YEAH. WHY NOT?

10:59.490 --> 11:02.995
MUTANT ALLIGATORS
ARE ONLY HUMAN, TOO.

11:02.996 --> 11:05.965
ALL RIGHT, GROUP,
LET'S TAKE FIVE.

11:05.966 --> 11:09.537
WHY DON'T YOU REST
IN THAT THERE SHADE?

11:09.538 --> 11:12.807
IT BE PLENTY COOL
THERE. I GUARANTEE.

11:12.808 --> 11:15.778
THAT'S MIGHTY THOUGHTFUL
OF HIM, DON'T YOU THINK?

11:15.779 --> 11:19.317
YEAH, FOR A MURDEROUS
STEALING, CHEATING,

11:19.318 --> 11:22.655
DOUBLE-CROSSER, AHH,
HE SURE IS NICE.

11:22.656 --> 11:24.558
FELLAS, I'VE
SUDDENLY GOT

11:24.559 --> 11:26.626
A SINKING FEELING
ABOUT THIS.

11:26.627 --> 11:29.030
THAT'S WEIRD.
SO DO I.

11:29.031 --> 11:30.599
NO WONDER.

11:30.600 --> 11:32.969
WE'RE STANDING
IN QUICKSAND.

11:32.970 --> 11:36.840
YOU FELL
FOR THE OLDEST TRICK
IN THIS HERE SWAMP.

11:36.841 --> 11:37.975
YEAH!

11:42.215 --> 11:45.085
WHAT DID I
TELL YOU--

11:45.086 --> 11:46.854
THAT ALLIGATOR
OUTSMARTED THEM.

11:46.855 --> 11:48.823
YOU BE FINISHED NOW.

11:48.824 --> 11:52.763
THE QUICKSAND TAKE
CARE OF YOU REAL GOOD.

11:52.764 --> 11:55.199
YOU'RE FORGETTING
ONE THING, MISTER--

11:55.200 --> 11:57.970
WHERE WE GO,
YOU GO.

12:03.644 --> 12:05.145
YOU'RE RIGHT,
BOSS.

12:05.146 --> 12:08.049
HE SURE
OUTSMARTED THEM.

12:08.050 --> 12:10.286
OH, SHUT UP.

12:12.090 --> 12:13.123
THIS STUFF'S
STICKIER

12:13.124 --> 12:15.526
THAN MICHELANGELO'S
MELTED MOZZARELLA.

12:15.527 --> 12:17.630
FELLAS,
WE'RE SINKING FAST.

12:17.631 --> 12:19.499
OH, THAT'S
JUST GREAT.

12:19.500 --> 12:23.471
WELL, THIS IS THE LAST
VACATION I EVER SPEND HERE.

12:34.220 --> 12:35.588
POOR LEATHERHEAD.

12:35.589 --> 12:38.257
HE SURE HAS
GOT HIMSELF IN A JAM.

12:38.258 --> 12:39.693
POOR LEATHERHEAD?

12:39.694 --> 12:41.595
WHAT ABOUT POOR US?

12:41.596 --> 12:44.299
I SUPPOSE IT'S
A LITTLE LATE
TO ASK YOU FROGS

12:44.300 --> 12:45.801
TO TEACH US
TO BREATHE
UNDER WATER?

12:45.802 --> 12:48.404
OH, WELL, WE COULDN'T
DO THAT.

12:48.405 --> 12:52.444
THAT'S A FAMILY SECRET
THAT'S GOING TO DIE WITH US.

12:52.445 --> 12:55.948
IT CERTAINLY IS,
YOU WEB-FOOTED WIMPS.

12:55.949 --> 12:57.517
SHREDDER!

12:57.518 --> 13:00.087
HURRY UP
AND GET THEM OUT.

13:01.090 --> 13:02.257
RIGHT, BOSS.

13:07.031 --> 13:09.500
YOU SAVED MY LIFE.
HEH HEH.

13:09.501 --> 13:11.703
WHAT FOR
YOU DO THAT?

13:11.704 --> 13:15.809
LET'S JUST SAY I'M A LOVER
OF ALL WILD CREATURES.

13:15.810 --> 13:18.312
WELL, THERE AIN'T
NO CREATURE

13:18.313 --> 13:21.683
WILDER THAN
OLD LEATHERHEAD,
YOU BETCHA!

13:21.684 --> 13:25.222
AH, THAT FEEL
PLENTY GOOD.

13:26.391 --> 13:28.826
I WISH YOU
WOULDN'T DO THAT.

13:28.827 --> 13:31.530
IT'S SO HARD TO FIND
A DECENT DRY-CLEANER

13:31.531 --> 13:32.932
IN THESE SWAMPS.

13:32.933 --> 13:36.370
WHY YOU BE SO GOOD
TO LEATHERHEAD?

13:36.371 --> 13:40.442
BECAUSE I HAVE
GREAT PLANS
FOR YOUR FUTURE.

13:40.443 --> 13:43.546
YO, SHREDHEAD,
WHAT ABOUT US?

13:43.547 --> 13:46.116
YOU'RE NOT JUST
GOING TO LEAVE US
HERE, ARE YOU?

13:46.117 --> 13:48.220
SORRY, BUT
I'VE ALREADY DONE

13:48.221 --> 13:50.956
MY REPTILE RESCUE
FOR THIS YEAR.

13:50.957 --> 13:53.694
WHAT A FITTING END
FOR THE BUNCH OF YOU--

13:53.695 --> 13:57.600
BACK INTO THE PRIMORDIAL
SWAMP YOU CAME FROM.

13:59.536 --> 14:02.773
GOLLY. HE SURE IS
ONE MEAN PERSON.

14:02.774 --> 14:04.241
BUT YOU GOT
TO ADMIT,

14:04.242 --> 14:06.111
HE DOES HAVE
A PLEASANT LAUGH.

14:06.112 --> 14:08.948
I GOT AN IDEA
TO GET US OUT OF HERE.

14:08.949 --> 14:10.984
OH, YEAH?
LIKE HOW?

14:10.985 --> 14:12.687
LIKE SO.

14:14.624 --> 14:16.458
FOLLOW ME, Y'ALL.

14:16.459 --> 14:19.396
IT'S WORKING,
NAPOLEON.

14:19.397 --> 14:21.565
YOU FIRST,
RASPUTIN.

14:21.566 --> 14:24.068
OH, NO.
AFTER YOU, ATTILA.

14:24.069 --> 14:26.071
OH, BUT I INSIST.

14:26.072 --> 14:27.641
BE MY GUEST.

14:27.642 --> 14:29.510
FELLAS,
THIS SOUTHERN
COURTESY

14:29.511 --> 14:30.745
IS A BIT MUCH.

14:30.746 --> 14:33.448
YEAH, IT'LL BE
THE DE-ATH OF ME.

14:33.449 --> 14:37.387
YUCK! MAXIMUM
GROSS-OUT, DUDES.

14:37.388 --> 14:40.290
THIS SWAMP
IS SCUZ CITY.

14:40.291 --> 14:43.829
OH, MY HAIR
IS AN ABSOLUTE MESS.

14:43.830 --> 14:47.301
SCOPE IT OUT, BUDS--
A PUBLIC BATH.

14:47.302 --> 14:49.871
COWABUNGA!

14:53.610 --> 14:58.316
THIS WATER FEELS
MONDO-BIZARRO
ON MY SHELL.

14:58.317 --> 15:01.453
MICHELANGELO,
YOU'RE STARTING
TO GLOW!

15:01.454 --> 15:04.757
OH, NO. IT MUST BE
THAT LEFT OVER MUTIGEN

15:04.758 --> 15:06.393
THAT TURNED OUR FRIENDS
THE FROGS HERE

15:06.394 --> 15:08.028
INTO THEIR
PRESENT FORM.

15:08.029 --> 15:10.231
DID YOU SAY
MUTIGEN?

15:10.232 --> 15:14.338
WHOA!
IT'S SPLIT-CITY
FOR THIS DUDE!

15:14.339 --> 15:17.208
DOES THIS MEAN IT'S
BACK TO THE PET SHOP
FOR MICHELANGELO?

15:17.209 --> 15:18.242
I DOUBT IT.

15:18.243 --> 15:20.179
IT'S NOT A STRONG
ENOUGH DOSE.

15:20.180 --> 15:23.517
UH, MAYBE YOU OUGHT TO
TAKE A REST, MICHELANGELO.

15:23.518 --> 15:25.419
ME REST?

15:25.420 --> 15:27.187
ARE YOU KIDDING,
DUDE?

15:27.188 --> 15:28.690
I'VE NEVER
FELT SO PUMPED

15:28.691 --> 15:30.693
IN MY WHOLE
LIFE!

15:41.376 --> 15:45.447
HMM. I HAVE A THEORY
ABOUT THAT POOL.

15:45.448 --> 15:48.384
DONATELLO,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

15:51.589 --> 15:53.124
YEAH!

15:53.125 --> 15:55.728
MICHELANGELO
WAS RIGHT.

15:55.729 --> 15:57.029
THAT WATER
MAKES YOU FEEL

15:57.030 --> 15:58.898
LIKE A YOUNG
TURTLE AGAIN.

15:58.899 --> 16:00.635
WHICH MEANS?

16:00.636 --> 16:02.402
THE MUTIGEN
CONTENT MIXED

16:02.403 --> 16:04.238
WITH THE WATER'S
NATURAL MINERALS

16:04.239 --> 16:07.577
HAVE TURNED IT
INTO A MODERN-DAY
FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH.

16:07.578 --> 16:08.946
A FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH?

16:08.947 --> 16:12.383
JUST THE THING
TO SHED A FEW WRINKLES.

16:12.384 --> 16:14.252
NO, BETTER NOT,
APRIL.

16:14.253 --> 16:17.156
WE DON'T KNOW HOW
THAT WATER MIGHT
AFFECT HUMANS.

16:17.157 --> 16:18.758
OH, GREAT.

16:18.759 --> 16:22.364
I'M DOOMED
TO BE A DECREPIT
28-YEAR-OLD HAG.

16:24.200 --> 16:27.337
ALL THIS HEAT IS
MAKING ME THIRSTY.

16:27.338 --> 16:30.442
IF ONLY I HAD
SOMETHING TO DRINK.

16:30.443 --> 16:33.646
WATER! I MUST
HAVE SOME.

16:35.449 --> 16:36.884
HOLD ON!

16:36.885 --> 16:39.020
THAT WATER NO GOOD
FOR DRINKING.

16:39.021 --> 16:41.757
IT BE FULL
OF VOODOO MAGIC.

16:41.758 --> 16:43.392
VOODOO MAGIC?

16:43.393 --> 16:45.762
WHAT SORT OF NONSENSE
ARE YOU BLABBERING ABOUT?

16:45.763 --> 16:47.731
WAIT.

16:47.732 --> 16:49.634
WHAT'S THAT
PECULIAR ODOR?

16:50.670 --> 16:52.472
MAYBE IT'S US,
BOSS.

16:52.473 --> 16:54.807
NO, NO. IT'S
SOMETHING ELSE.

16:54.808 --> 16:58.313
NOW I REMEMBER.
IT'S MUTIGEN.

16:58.314 --> 16:59.647
AIN'T THAT
THE STUFF

16:59.648 --> 17:02.285
THAT TURNED ME
INTO A WARTHOG?

17:02.286 --> 17:04.954
AND ME
INTO A RHINO?

17:04.955 --> 17:07.459
AND ME
INTO A GATORMAN?

17:07.460 --> 17:09.295
PRECISELY.

17:09.296 --> 17:12.565
AND IN ALL YOUR CASES
IT WAS A DEFINITE IMPROVEMENT.

17:12.566 --> 17:14.335
NOW QUIET, ALL OF YOU.

17:14.336 --> 17:15.836
I MUST
THINK OF SOME WAY

17:15.837 --> 17:18.673
TO TRANSPORT
THIS MUTIGEN
BACK TO KRANG.

17:18.674 --> 17:19.809
HOLD ON.

17:19.810 --> 17:23.513
SOMEBODY, SHE BE
COMING THIS WAY.

17:23.515 --> 17:26.417
IT'S THE TURTLES.
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

17:26.419 --> 17:29.055
HOW DID THEY ESCAPE
FROM THAT QUICKSAND TRAP?

17:29.056 --> 17:31.391
IT MAKE NO NEVER MIND.

17:31.392 --> 17:35.363
THIS TIME
WE FINISH THEM GOOD,
YOU BETCHA.

17:35.364 --> 17:36.832
YOU STILL FEELING
THE EFFECTS

17:36.833 --> 17:39.236
OF THAT MUTIGENATED
WATER, MICHELANGELO?

17:39.237 --> 17:42.039
MAN, I FEEL
TOTALLY JAZZED.

17:42.040 --> 17:45.310
LIKE I COULD
TANGLE WITH ANYONE.

17:46.947 --> 17:50.150
DID YOU SAY ANYONE?

17:50.151 --> 17:51.652
ROCK STEADY.

17:51.653 --> 17:54.155
AND LET'S NOT
FORGET US.

17:54.156 --> 17:57.259
AND ME, TOO.
HEH HEH HEH.

17:57.260 --> 18:00.396
SHREDHEAD
AND LEATHERHEAD
JOINING FORCES?

18:00.397 --> 18:01.466
WHY NOT?

18:01.467 --> 18:03.401
THEY SAY TWO HEADS
ARE BETTER THAN ONE.

18:03.402 --> 18:05.771
LIKE, GET SERIOUS,
DUDES.

18:05.772 --> 18:07.607
WE'VE GOT YOU
OUTNUMBERED.

18:07.608 --> 18:10.711
YEAH.
AND THERE'S ALSO
MORE OF US THAN YOU.

18:10.712 --> 18:12.281
GET THEM!

18:12.282 --> 18:14.784
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO ASK US TWICE.

18:16.620 --> 18:19.222
RASPUTIN, HAVEN'T
YOU GOT AN ARROW

18:19.223 --> 18:20.892
FOR A SITUATION
LIKE THIS?

18:20.893 --> 18:23.095
AS A MATTER
OF FACT, I DO.

18:23.096 --> 18:25.866
THEY CAN'T SHOOT
WHAT THEY CAN'T SEE.

18:29.138 --> 18:32.174
OK, TURTLES,
NOW'S OUR CHANCE!

18:32.175 --> 18:33.943
UH-OH, FELLAS.

18:33.944 --> 18:36.914
I THINK THE WIND
JUST CHANGED.

18:40.953 --> 18:44.491
I DISTINCTLY ASKED
FOR THE NO-SMOKING SECTION.

18:46.828 --> 18:48.096
BLASTED SMOKE!

18:53.171 --> 18:55.840
WHA--WHAT'S
HAPPENING TO ME?

18:55.841 --> 19:01.081
I'M SHRINKING!

19:01.949 --> 19:04.451
WE GOT THEM NOW,
BOSS.

19:04.452 --> 19:06.387
DUH, BOSS?

19:11.662 --> 19:14.900
DON'T JUST STAND
THERE, YOU MORONS.

19:14.901 --> 19:16.735
DO SOMETHING!

19:16.736 --> 19:20.373
IT REALLY IS
A FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH.

19:20.374 --> 19:23.244
NOW AREN'T YOU GLAD
YOU DIDN'T GO IN?

19:23.245 --> 19:27.216
AW, AIN'T HE CUTE?

19:27.217 --> 19:30.553
CAREFUL, YOU
OVERGROWN KLUTZ.

19:30.554 --> 19:33.926
YOU WANT WE SHOULD
BURP YOU, BOSS?

19:33.927 --> 19:35.928
MAYBE HE FAILED,

19:35.929 --> 19:40.367
BUT I'LL GET
RID OF YOU.
I GUARANTEE.

19:40.368 --> 19:42.436
HEY, WHAT YOU DO?

19:48.880 --> 19:52.183
THE DAM, SHE BLASTED
TO SMITHEREENS!

19:52.184 --> 19:55.120
GET DOWN!
OH, NO!

20:04.401 --> 20:07.738
MAYBE YOU WIN
THIS TIME, HEH HEH,

20:07.739 --> 20:11.744
BUT I'M GOING
TO BE BACK, YOU BETCHA!

20:13.280 --> 20:15.649
GOOD GOING,
DONATELLO.

20:15.650 --> 20:17.551
YEAH, IT SURE WAS NEAT

20:17.552 --> 20:19.787
THE WAY YOU BLEW
UP THAT DAM.

20:19.788 --> 20:22.024
ME? BLEW UP THE DAM?

20:22.025 --> 20:24.828
YOU DID PLAN IT THAT
WAY, DIDN'T YOU?

20:24.829 --> 20:26.563
OH...OH, YEAH.

20:26.564 --> 20:29.400
UH, SURE.
OF COURSE. YOU BET.

20:30.904 --> 20:32.972
WHAT'S KEEPING
SHREDDER?

20:32.973 --> 20:35.442
HE SHOULD'VE
BEEN BACK BY NOW.

20:35.443 --> 20:38.246
I WANT THAT
WATER SAMPLE.

20:41.752 --> 20:46.356
SHREDDER,
IS THAT REALLY YOU?

20:46.357 --> 20:49.227
BOO-HOO, KRANG,

20:49.228 --> 20:51.331
YOU'VE GOT TO HELP ME.

20:51.332 --> 20:53.701
I NEED TO GROW UP.

20:55.303 --> 20:59.142
I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO TELL YOU THAT
FOR YEARS.

21:00.544 --> 21:05.183
GEE, I FEEL
JUST LIKE A DADDY.

21:07.220 --> 21:09.956
OH, JUST WAIT
TILL I'M BIG.

21:09.957 --> 21:11.557
OH, YOU'RE GOING
TO GET IT!

21:14.396 --> 21:17.967
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE
OUR JOB HERE IS DONE,
FROG FRIENDS.

21:17.968 --> 21:20.137
IT'S BACK
TO THE CITY FOR US.

21:20.138 --> 21:21.471
IT'S PROBABLY BEST

21:21.472 --> 21:23.541
THAT THE FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH
REMAIN A SECRET.

21:23.542 --> 21:26.512
DON'T WORRY. WE ALREADY
FORGOT ABOUT IT.

21:26.513 --> 21:28.248
FORGOT ABOUT WHAT?

21:28.249 --> 21:30.850
AND DON'T WORRY
ABOUT OLD LEATHERLIPS.

21:30.851 --> 21:33.355
WE HUNG THAT DUDE
OUT TO DRY.

21:33.356 --> 21:35.257
BUT TOTALLY.

21:37.428 --> 21:40.431
WHO HUNG WHO OUT,
MICHELANGELO?

21:40.432 --> 21:44.202
MAJOR BUMMER, DUDES.
