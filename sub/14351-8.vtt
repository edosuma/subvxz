00:17.725 --> 00:21.972
- Do we have maximum magnification?
- Yes, sir.

00:27.694 --> 00:31.312
- Missile spread, Mr. Spock?
- Very archaic type. Sublight speed.

00:31.490 --> 00:33.399
Aye, and chemically fuelled to boot,
sir.

00:33.575 --> 00:36.529
- Anything on communication, Uhura?
- No, sir, all bands clear.

00:36.703 --> 00:42.576
- Course of the missile, Mr. Spock?
- The Enterprise is the target, captain.

00:43.377 --> 00:45.453
Prepare Phaser Banks 1 and 2,
Mr. Sulu.

00:45.630 --> 00:46.910
Aye, sir.

00:47.090 --> 00:49.711
Mr. Chekov, get a fix
on the missile's point of origin.

00:49.884 --> 00:51.213
Aye, captain.

00:51.386 --> 00:54.221
Phasers 1 and 2
locked in and ready, sir.

00:55.974 --> 00:57.468
Fire phasers.

01:03.649 --> 01:07.232
Mr. Chekov, alter course
to the missile's point of origin.

01:07.403 --> 01:09.063
- Aye, sir.
- Warp Factor 3, Mr. Sulu.

01:09.238 --> 01:10.649
Warp Factor 3, sir.

01:16.746 --> 01:20.696
I am a nurse first, Dr. McCoy,
and a member of the crew second.

01:20.876 --> 01:22.750
You're excused.
You may return to your quarters.

01:22.920 --> 01:27.665
No, I'm sorry, doctor. I've called
the captain and I'll wait until he comes.

01:29.677 --> 01:34.090
- What's the emergency?
- I said you were excused, nurse.

01:34.849 --> 01:38.052
Please, Christine. I promise you
I'll give the captain a full report.

01:47.863 --> 01:49.856
That was quite a scene.

01:50.032 --> 01:53.152
I've completed the standard physical
examinations for the entire crew.

01:53.327 --> 01:56.114
- Excellent. What's the emergency?
- The crew is fit.

01:56.288 --> 01:59.788
I found nothing unusual,
with one exception.

02:00.209 --> 02:02.286
- Serious?
- Terminal.

02:02.837 --> 02:06.041
- What is it?
- Xenopolycythemia. It has no cure.

02:08.759 --> 02:11.251
- Who?
- He has one year to live at the most.

02:11.430 --> 02:15.380
- Who is it?
- The ship's chief medical officer.

02:17.311 --> 02:20.016
- You?
- I'll be most effective on the job

02:20.189 --> 02:22.312
if you'll keep this to yourself.

02:34.496 --> 02:37.996
Space, the final frontier.

02:43.506 --> 02:47.634
These are the voyages
of the starship Enterprise.

02:47.802 --> 02:51.752
Its five-year mission:
To explore strange new worlds,

02:51.931 --> 02:55.715
to seek out new life
and new civilisations,

02:55.894 --> 02:58.978
to boldly go where no man
has gone before.

03:43.403 --> 03:46.570
Captain's log, stardate 5476.3.

03:46.740 --> 03:48.733
I have just had the sad duty
of informing Starfleet

03:48.909 --> 03:50.818
about Dr. McCoy's condition

03:50.994 --> 03:54.827
and have requested
an immediate replacement.

03:56.667 --> 03:59.075
- Mr. Spock.
- Yes, captain?

03:59.253 --> 04:02.207
Confirm Chekov's coordinates
for the missile's point of origin.

04:02.632 --> 04:05.004
Correct, captain. We are approaching
those coordinates.

04:05.176 --> 04:06.587
And that object on the screen?

04:08.179 --> 04:11.679
An asteroid, 200 miles in diameter.

04:11.850 --> 04:14.602
Could the enemy vessel
be hiding behind the asteroid?

04:14.770 --> 04:17.439
Negative, captain. We've had
that area on scanners constantly.

04:20.233 --> 04:23.603
Then the asteroid
is the missile's point of origin?

04:23.863 --> 04:24.894
Correct, captain.

04:29.077 --> 04:31.782
Full sensor probe, Mr. Spock.

04:34.291 --> 04:39.000
Typical asteroid chemically,
but it is not orbiting.

04:39.171 --> 04:43.465
It is pursuing an independent
course through this solar system.

04:43.634 --> 04:45.377
How could that be?

04:46.137 --> 04:51.593
Unless it's powered. A spaceship?

04:51.768 --> 04:56.062
It is under power, captain. And
correcting for all gravitational stresses.

04:56.231 --> 04:58.983
- Source of power?
- Atomic, very archaic.

04:59.150 --> 05:02.567
Leaving a trail of debris
and hard radiation.

05:02.738 --> 05:03.983
Mr. Chekov, plot the course

05:04.156 --> 05:05.816
- of the asteroid vessel.
- Aye, sir.

05:05.991 --> 05:10.155
Asteroid has an outer shell,
which is hollow.

05:10.704 --> 05:13.160
It surrounds
an independent inner core,

05:13.332 --> 05:15.574
which has a breathable atmosphere.

05:15.751 --> 05:18.040
Sensors read no life forms.

05:18.212 --> 05:20.964
Then it must be
on automatic controls.

05:21.132 --> 05:25.296
Or the passengers, or builders,
are dead.

05:27.973 --> 05:34.592
Course of asteroid,
I mean, spaceship, 241, mark 17.

05:34.939 --> 05:36.766
- Interesting.
- Yes.

05:36.941 --> 05:39.514
The course Ensign Chekov
just gave for the asteroid

05:39.694 --> 05:43.644
would put it on a collision course
with Daran V.

05:45.700 --> 05:50.078
- Daran V? Inhabited.
- Correct.

05:50.247 --> 05:55.621
Population approximately 3 billion,
724 million, if memory serves me.

05:55.794 --> 05:59.792
Estimated time of impact, 396 days.

06:02.176 --> 06:06.506
Mr. Sulu, Match Enterprise
speed with that of the asteroid vessel.

06:06.681 --> 06:08.223
Mr. Spock and I
are transporting aboard.

06:08.391 --> 06:11.226
- Mr. Scott, you have the Conn.
- Aye, sir.

06:18.026 --> 06:23.068
A lot can happen in a year.
Please give yourself every minute.

06:28.746 --> 06:32.365
Dr. McCoy,
Mr. Spock and I will handle this.

06:32.876 --> 06:35.414
Without me, Jim?
You'd never find your way back.

06:36.254 --> 06:37.832
Well...

06:38.673 --> 06:42.718
- I think it would be wiser if...
- I'd like to go. I'm fine, captain.

06:45.431 --> 06:48.764
All right, doctor.
If that's what you want.

07:11.083 --> 07:13.621
You'd swear
you were on the surface of a planet.

07:13.794 --> 07:17.210
One fails to see the logic
in making a ship look like a planet.

07:17.381 --> 07:20.715
Wouldn't know this was a spaceship.
Kirk to Enterprise.

07:20.885 --> 07:22.083
Enterprise, Scott here.

07:22.262 --> 07:25.263
Transported without incident.
Kirk out.

07:50.166 --> 07:52.408
No apparent opening.

07:53.336 --> 07:56.207
You've found no intelligent life forms,
Mr. Spock, but surely...

07:56.381 --> 08:00.296
The asteroid ship
is over 10,000 years old, doctor.

08:00.469 --> 08:03.838
Still no sign of life forms, captain.

08:51.732 --> 08:53.689
These are weapons?

08:54.193 --> 08:58.606
Of a sort.
Weapons, communication devices.

08:58.781 --> 09:00.655
Let me go to my friend.

09:12.588 --> 09:15.957
- You all right?
- I think so.

09:19.345 --> 09:23.639
I am Natira,
the high priestess of the people.

09:23.808 --> 09:26.679
Welcome to the world of Yonada.

09:26.853 --> 09:29.344
I can't say I think much
of your welcome.

09:30.565 --> 09:32.273
Take them.

10:37.053 --> 10:39.046
You will kneel.

10:56.115 --> 10:58.737
She called this "the world."

10:58.910 --> 11:00.902
These people don't know
they're on a spaceship.

11:01.079 --> 11:06.785
They've been in flight 10,000 years.
Maybe they don't realise it.

11:09.588 --> 11:15.211
Oh, Oracle of the people,
most perfect and wise.

11:15.386 --> 11:18.552
Strangers have come to our world.

11:18.722 --> 11:22.637
They bear instruments
we do not understand.

11:36.950 --> 11:38.231
Who are you?

11:43.249 --> 11:45.787
I am Captain Kirk
of the starship Enterprise.

11:45.960 --> 11:51.085
This is my medical officer, Dr. McCoy.
My first officer, Mr. Spock.

11:53.092 --> 11:56.094
For what reason
do you visit this world?

11:56.263 --> 11:58.670
We've come in friendship.

11:59.725 --> 12:02.263
Then learn what it means
to be our enemy

12:02.436 --> 12:05.105
before you learn what it means
to be our friend.

12:24.126 --> 12:25.584
Spock.

12:28.297 --> 12:30.124
Dr. McCoy.

12:31.217 --> 12:32.592
Bones.

12:32.760 --> 12:34.302
Bones?

12:34.887 --> 12:37.557
The doctor must have received
an excessively large electrical shock.

12:37.723 --> 12:39.432
No, that's not it.

12:40.435 --> 12:42.842
Nothing else could have caused this,
captain.

12:43.021 --> 12:45.975
At least,
nothing that has happened here.

12:47.067 --> 12:48.098
You're right, Spock.

12:48.276 --> 12:51.562
The shock was serious because
of McCoy's weakened condition.

12:51.738 --> 12:56.151
May I ask precisely
what is troubling the doctor?

12:59.497 --> 13:02.367
I don't think he would have told you
himself,

13:02.917 --> 13:05.289
but I think you should know now.

13:05.962 --> 13:07.622
It's xenopolycythemia.

13:10.467 --> 13:15.094
Yes. I know of it, captain.

13:15.264 --> 13:17.137
Then you know
that nothing can be done.

13:26.359 --> 13:29.443
Bones, how is it?

13:30.989 --> 13:32.732
I'm all right.

13:34.034 --> 13:37.367
- Are you all right, Mr. Spock?
- Very well, doctor.

13:37.537 --> 13:40.741
The captain and I
seem to have suffered no ill effects.

13:40.916 --> 13:43.703
That Oracle really got to me.

13:44.211 --> 13:48.209
I must be especially
susceptible to its magic spells.

13:54.138 --> 13:55.170
Spock knows.

14:02.105 --> 14:05.391
Well, we better
get to the control room.

14:07.486 --> 14:10.855
- Are you in any condition to get up?
- Don't worry, I can make it, Jim.

14:11.031 --> 14:14.566
Captain, informing these people
they're on a ship

14:14.744 --> 14:17.698
may be in violation of the
Prime Directive of Starfleet Command.

14:17.872 --> 14:21.491
No, the people of Yonada
may be changed by the knowledge,

14:21.668 --> 14:23.993
but it's better
than exterminating them.

14:24.170 --> 14:27.622
- Logical, captain.
- And the 3 billion on Daran V.

14:27.799 --> 14:30.255
Also logical, captain.

14:30.552 --> 14:33.126
Gentlemen,
I believe we have a visitor.

14:52.784 --> 14:54.492
For strength.

14:54.661 --> 14:58.280
Many of us have felt
the power of our Oracle.

14:58.457 --> 15:01.292
This has been of benefit.

15:02.628 --> 15:05.380
Tastes like an ancient herb
derivative.

15:11.596 --> 15:16.638
- You are not of Yonada.
- No, we're from outside your world.

15:17.853 --> 15:20.558
Where is outside?

15:23.067 --> 15:24.561
Up there.

15:25.069 --> 15:27.642
Outside, up there, everywhere.

15:30.992 --> 15:33.317
So they say, also.

15:38.083 --> 15:40.656
Many years ago,

15:41.586 --> 15:46.747
I climbed the mountains,
even though it is forbidden.

15:50.346 --> 15:51.461
Why is it forbidden?

15:52.974 --> 15:55.013
I am not sure.

15:58.188 --> 16:02.933
But things are not as they teach us.

16:06.071 --> 16:09.108
For the world is hollow,

16:09.283 --> 16:13.744
and I have touched the sky.

16:19.502 --> 16:21.293
What is it, Bones?

16:21.713 --> 16:23.871
There's something under the skin.

16:29.221 --> 16:31.095
He's dead.

16:32.891 --> 16:36.676
"For the world is hollow
and I have touched the sky."

16:36.854 --> 16:38.728
He said it was forbidden
to climb the mountains.

16:38.898 --> 16:40.558
Yes, of course it is.

16:40.733 --> 16:42.227
Because if you did,
you'd touch the sky

16:42.401 --> 16:44.690
and find out that you were living
on a big ball.

16:44.862 --> 16:49.240
Not a planet, but a spaceship. And
that knowledge seems to be forbidden.

16:51.870 --> 16:53.150
What happened?

16:53.330 --> 16:56.247
We don't know. He just suddenly
screamed in pain and died.

16:56.750 --> 16:58.542
Fetch the guard.

17:02.882 --> 17:05.917
Forgive him, for he was an old man.

17:06.426 --> 17:08.917
And old men are sometimes foolish.

17:09.097 --> 17:15.051
But it is written that those
of the people who sin or speak evil

17:15.228 --> 17:17.933
shall be punished.

17:25.698 --> 17:28.532
He served well for many years.

17:28.701 --> 17:30.943
Take him away gently.

17:43.050 --> 17:46.549
You do not seem well.
It is distressing to me.

17:46.720 --> 17:49.294
Oh, no, I'm quite all right, thank you.

17:50.349 --> 17:56.304
It is the will of the Oracle that you now
be treated as honoured guests.

18:00.818 --> 18:03.060
- You seem to be the special favourite.
- Indeed, doctor.

18:03.238 --> 18:06.441
The young lady did show a marked
preference for your company.

18:06.616 --> 18:09.072
Well, now, nobody can blame her
for that, can they?

18:09.244 --> 18:11.367
Personally, I find the lady's taste
questionable.

18:11.538 --> 18:16.781
But she obviously prefers you
and you obviously don't seem to mind.

18:17.420 --> 18:21.252
If you could arrange
to be alone with the young lady,

18:21.424 --> 18:26.003
Spock and I would be left alone
to find the power controls of this world.

18:28.890 --> 18:32.176
It is time to refresh yourselves.

18:37.024 --> 18:38.898
Thank you, Mr. Spock.

18:42.488 --> 18:45.857
To our good friends of Yonada.

18:47.535 --> 18:51.580
- We are very interested in your world.
- That pleases us.

18:51.748 --> 18:53.705
Good, then you wouldn't mind
if we looked around?

18:53.875 --> 18:56.876
Not at all.
The people know of you now.

18:58.672 --> 19:00.665
Are you well enough to go about?

19:03.052 --> 19:04.795
Perhaps not.

19:05.304 --> 19:10.725
Then why not remain here?
Rest, we will talk.

19:11.102 --> 19:12.513
You are very kind.

19:14.522 --> 19:17.192
You are free to go about
and meet our people.

19:17.901 --> 19:19.229
Thank you.

19:19.402 --> 19:22.736
And thank you
for taking care of Dr. McCoy.

19:22.906 --> 19:25.991
Not at all. We shall make him well.

19:31.374 --> 19:33.082
Mr. Spock.

19:39.924 --> 19:41.584
No, thank you.

19:45.514 --> 19:47.257
Leave us.

19:50.102 --> 19:55.263
I'm curious. How did the Oracle
punish the old man?

19:55.941 --> 20:00.438
I cannot tell you now.

20:01.322 --> 20:05.106
There is some way the Oracle
knows what you say, isn't there?

20:05.994 --> 20:08.781
What we say, what we think.

20:08.955 --> 20:13.416
The Oracle knows the minds
and the hearts of all the people.

20:17.590 --> 20:21.041
I did not know
you would be hurt so badly.

20:21.510 --> 20:23.135
It's all right.

20:24.472 --> 20:27.141
I suppose we had to learn
the power of the Oracle.

20:27.308 --> 20:32.017
McCoy, there is something I must say.
Since the moment l...

20:39.905 --> 20:44.900
It is not in the manner of the people
to hide their feelings.

20:47.413 --> 20:50.829
Honesty is usually wise.

20:52.210 --> 20:53.669
Is there a woman for you?

21:00.344 --> 21:02.052
No, there isn't.

21:03.555 --> 21:07.007
Does McCoy find me attractive?

21:07.184 --> 21:10.304
Oh, yes. Yes, I do.

21:13.983 --> 21:19.689
I hope you men of space,
of other worlds,

21:19.864 --> 21:23.530
hold truth as dear as we do.

21:23.827 --> 21:24.858
We do.

21:28.540 --> 21:34.211
I wish you to stay here, on Yonada,
as my mate.

21:52.649 --> 21:54.523
But we're strangers to each other.

21:55.444 --> 21:59.145
But is not that the nature
of men and women?

21:59.323 --> 22:01.814
That the pleasure
is in the learning of each other?

22:04.037 --> 22:05.068
Yes.

22:07.290 --> 22:09.912
Let the thought rest in your heart,
McCoy.

22:16.091 --> 22:17.254
Incredible as it may seem,

22:17.426 --> 22:20.213
these people have no idea
they're living on a spaceship.

22:20.387 --> 22:23.472
I wonder how many generations
have lived out their lives,

22:23.641 --> 22:26.262
and been buried here,

22:26.435 --> 22:29.721
without ever knowing
that their world is hollow?

22:30.315 --> 22:33.102
The people, in the fullness of time,

22:33.276 --> 22:35.435
will reach a new world.

22:35.612 --> 22:39.028
Rich, green, lovely to the eyes,

22:39.199 --> 22:44.241
and of a goodness that will fill the
hearts of the people with tears of joy.

22:47.124 --> 22:50.209
You can share that world with me,

22:50.378 --> 22:51.955
rule it by my side.

22:55.049 --> 22:59.130
How long will it take you
to reach this new world?

23:00.472 --> 23:04.055
Soon.
The Oracle will only say "soon."

23:06.478 --> 23:10.144
If you only knew how I needed
some kind of future, Natira.

23:11.567 --> 23:13.939
You have lived a lonely life?

23:15.154 --> 23:18.488
Yes, very lonely.

23:21.411 --> 23:23.653
No more, McCoy.

23:25.916 --> 23:29.499
There will be no more loneliness
for you.

23:31.338 --> 23:34.838
- There's something I need to tell you.
- There is nothing you need to say.

23:35.009 --> 23:37.963
- But there is.
- Then tell me.

23:38.137 --> 23:40.509
If the telling is such a need.

23:41.474 --> 23:43.930
I have an illness
for which there is no cure.

23:48.565 --> 23:49.810
I have one year to live.

23:56.073 --> 23:58.529
Until I saw you,
there was nothing in my heart.

23:58.701 --> 24:02.533
It sustained my life,
but nothing more.

24:03.456 --> 24:06.208
Now it sings.

24:06.959 --> 24:11.040
I could be happy
to have that feeling for a day

24:11.297 --> 24:12.329
a week, a month,

24:14.593 --> 24:16.384
a year.

24:17.512 --> 24:20.383
Whatever the creators
hold in store for us.

24:45.000 --> 24:48.583
Captain, the Oracle room.

24:54.469 --> 24:57.838
The problem: To get in.

24:58.014 --> 25:00.684
I believe that I can...

25:05.772 --> 25:08.310
The writing is definitely Fabrini,
captain. I recognise it.

25:08.484 --> 25:12.528
Fabrini. Didn't the Fabrini sun go nova
and destroy its planets?

25:12.696 --> 25:15.069
Yes. Toward the end,
the Fabrini people lived underground

25:15.241 --> 25:18.277
as these people do
to protect themselves.

25:18.453 --> 25:20.741
Some of them must have been
put aboard this ship.

25:20.913 --> 25:23.202
And sent to another planet.

25:23.374 --> 25:27.787
And these are their descendants.

25:29.631 --> 25:31.125
Now.

25:53.323 --> 25:55.232
The Oracle doesn't
seem to know we're here.

25:58.912 --> 26:03.076
- I wonder what alerted it the first time.
- Captain.

26:03.334 --> 26:06.501
If I remember correctly,
the Oracle's reprehensible conduct

26:06.671 --> 26:09.672
was initiated when Natira knelt
on that platform.

26:09.841 --> 26:13.292
I think you're right.
Continue investigating.

26:13.887 --> 26:16.259
The clue to the location
of the control room

26:16.431 --> 26:18.887
must be around here somewhere.

26:28.652 --> 26:31.191
Nothing here would indicate
this is anything but a planet.

26:38.580 --> 26:39.611
There's no question,

26:39.789 --> 26:43.490
but that the creators
would have been considered gods.

26:49.758 --> 26:53.377
This plaque is a representation
of a star and its solar system.

26:53.971 --> 26:55.216
Eight planets, captain.

26:55.389 --> 26:57.216
That is the number
in the Fabrina solar system.

26:57.391 --> 26:59.764
There's no doubt these people
are descendants of the Fabrini.

26:59.936 --> 27:01.845
None. And no doubt
that they've been in flight

27:02.021 --> 27:05.640
on this asteroid ship
for 10,000 years.

27:20.541 --> 27:21.573
Speak.

27:23.920 --> 27:27.419
- It is I, Natira.
- Yes, Natira.

27:28.591 --> 27:33.254
It is written that only the high priestess
of the people may select her mate.

27:34.056 --> 27:35.930
It is so written.

27:37.768 --> 27:41.054
The strangers among us,
the three visitors,

27:41.230 --> 27:44.065
there is one called McCoy.

27:44.233 --> 27:45.941
I wish him to remain here,

27:47.612 --> 27:48.727
as my mate.

27:50.406 --> 27:51.949
Does he agree to this?

27:52.659 --> 27:56.408
I have asked him.
He has not yet given me his answer.

27:56.580 --> 28:00.791
He must become one of the people,
worship the creators,

28:00.959 --> 28:04.245
and agree to the insertion
of the Instrument of Obedience.

28:04.421 --> 28:06.580
He will be told what must be done.

28:06.757 --> 28:09.961
If he agrees to all things,
it is permitted.

28:10.678 --> 28:14.130
Teach him our laws carefully
so he commits no sacrilege,

28:14.307 --> 28:18.803
no offence against the people
or the creators.

28:18.979 --> 28:23.855
It will be done, oh, most wise.

28:40.919 --> 28:42.496
Who are the intruders?

28:42.671 --> 28:44.747
Two of the strangers,
Kirk and Spock.

28:44.923 --> 28:46.999
- McCoy is not with them?
- No.

28:47.175 --> 28:49.501
Kirk and Spock
have committed sacrilege.

28:49.678 --> 28:52.086
- You know what must be done.
- I know.

28:55.184 --> 28:58.600
When the Oracle releases them,
take them.

28:59.313 --> 29:01.935
Fools. You think we are children?

29:02.108 --> 29:03.483
You think you can do as you please,

29:03.651 --> 29:06.855
commit whatever offence
amuses you?

29:23.214 --> 29:25.290
What are you going to do
to my friends?

29:25.466 --> 29:28.171
They entered the Oracle room.

29:28.970 --> 29:32.090
- And the punishment is death?
- Yes.

29:32.265 --> 29:37.390
I can make no other decision. We gave
them our trust, they betrayed us.

29:37.563 --> 29:42.355
- They acted out of ignorance, Natira.
- They said they came in friendship.

29:42.526 --> 29:46.738
- Please, let them return to the ship.
- I cannot.

29:48.616 --> 29:49.647
For me?

29:54.956 --> 29:56.783
I've made my decision.

29:56.958 --> 30:00.078
I'm staying here, on Yonada.

30:05.050 --> 30:06.710
Natira.

30:07.553 --> 30:10.507
What they did,
they did because they felt they had to.

30:10.973 --> 30:14.473
Please, let them return to the ship.
You won't regret it.

30:15.103 --> 30:16.182
How do you think I'd feel

30:16.354 --> 30:19.854
if I stayed here with a chance
to be happy for the first time in my life,

30:20.025 --> 30:22.064
but knowing my friends had died?

30:24.237 --> 30:25.862
Yes.

30:29.493 --> 30:33.111
So be it. This I will do for McCoy.

30:35.708 --> 30:39.872
For our happiness and future.

30:58.566 --> 31:01.318
- You're returning with us?
- No, I'm not.

31:02.487 --> 31:04.479
Bones, this isn't a planet,
it's a spaceship,

31:04.656 --> 31:06.613
on a collision course with Daran V.

31:08.451 --> 31:11.121
I'm on a kind of a collision course
myself, Jim.

31:11.288 --> 31:13.957
Dr. McCoy,
I order you to return with us.

31:14.124 --> 31:15.618
And I refuse.

31:19.338 --> 31:23.502
Bones, if we can't correct the course
of this ship,

31:24.260 --> 31:25.838
we'll have to blast it out of space.

31:26.012 --> 31:30.341
I intend to stay on this ship
with these people, whatever happens.

31:30.850 --> 31:33.685
Your decision is most illogical,
doctor.

31:35.021 --> 31:38.106
Is it, Mr. Spock? Is it really?

31:40.402 --> 31:42.276
Natira's asked me to stay
and I'm staying.

31:42.821 --> 31:45.692
- As her husband?
- Yes.

31:48.911 --> 31:50.619
Is that too much to ask, Jim?

31:53.374 --> 31:55.700
- Kirk to Enterprise.
- Scott here, captain.

31:55.877 --> 31:57.953
We're beaming over.
Lock in on our signal.

31:58.129 --> 31:59.837
Aye, captain.

32:00.215 --> 32:02.884
And transport Mr. Spock
and myself immediately.

32:03.051 --> 32:05.803
But, captain,
what about Dr. McCoy?

32:18.234 --> 32:21.520
He's staying, Scotty. Kirk out.

32:36.337 --> 32:38.330
To become one of the people
of Yonada,

32:38.506 --> 32:42.753
the Instrument of Obedience
must be made part of your flesh.

32:44.637 --> 32:47.473
Do you now give your consent?

32:48.183 --> 32:51.100
- I do.
- Proceed.

32:58.944 --> 33:03.903
Say now
because once done, it is done.

33:04.408 --> 33:06.282
Let it be done.

33:13.835 --> 33:17.785
You are now one with my people.

33:26.223 --> 33:29.059
May I give you the love you want,

33:29.227 --> 33:32.144
and make the time you have
beautiful.

33:33.523 --> 33:35.812
We are now of one mind.

33:35.984 --> 33:37.941
One heart.

33:38.278 --> 33:39.309
One life.

33:53.794 --> 33:58.124
It is done, oh, most wise.

33:58.299 --> 34:01.170
Our living link with the creators.

34:01.761 --> 34:04.513
Teach him, then, what he must know
as one of the people.

34:29.541 --> 34:32.210
This is the Book of the People,

34:32.377 --> 34:35.960
to be opened and read when we reach
the new world of the promise.

34:36.130 --> 34:38.967
It was given by the creators.

34:39.135 --> 34:41.377
Do the people know the contents
of their book?

34:41.554 --> 34:43.511
Only that it tells of our world here

34:43.681 --> 34:48.141
and why soon one day
we must leave it for the new world.

34:48.520 --> 34:51.853
Has the reason that the people must
leave here been revealed to you?

34:52.899 --> 34:54.809
No, it has not.

34:56.152 --> 34:59.356
- Don't you long to know its secrets?
- No.

34:59.531 --> 35:00.563
It is enough for me

35:00.741 --> 35:04.573
to know that we shall understand
all when we reach our home.

35:10.084 --> 35:13.917
Captain's log, stardate 5476.4.

35:14.089 --> 35:16.627
We are on a parallel course
with Yonada.

35:16.800 --> 35:19.505
It is still on a collision course
with Daran V.

35:19.678 --> 35:21.172
Our failure to correct its course,

35:21.346 --> 35:23.588
and the critical nature
of Dr. McCoy's illness,

35:23.766 --> 35:27.764
made contact with Starfleet Command
imperative.

35:28.729 --> 35:32.063
Captain Kirk,
I sympathise with your wish to stay.

35:32.233 --> 35:34.107
But I hope you recognise
the necessity

35:34.277 --> 35:36.104
that you continue your mission
at once.

35:36.279 --> 35:40.941
- That is the problem, sir.
- Perhaps I haven't made myself clear.

35:41.117 --> 35:43.027
Let me restate it.

35:43.203 --> 35:45.030
You have been relieved
of all responsibility

35:45.205 --> 35:47.281
for the asteroid ship Yonada.

35:47.458 --> 35:49.616
Starfleet Command
will take care of the situation.

35:57.844 --> 35:59.753
I believe it is time to move on.

36:01.556 --> 36:03.928
Yes, those are the orders.

36:04.851 --> 36:07.722
Captain Kirk.
Bridge to Captain Kirk.

36:07.896 --> 36:08.927
Kirk here.

36:09.106 --> 36:11.811
An urgent call from Dr. McCoy, sir.

36:11.984 --> 36:14.475
- Put him on.
- Jim?

36:14.737 --> 36:15.768
Yes, Bones.

36:15.946 --> 36:18.734
We may be able to get these people
back on course.

36:18.908 --> 36:20.402
You've located the controls?

36:20.576 --> 36:21.774
No, but I've seen the book

36:21.953 --> 36:24.658
that contains all the knowledge
of the creators.

36:24.831 --> 36:26.159
And if you...

36:29.461 --> 36:31.584
If you can get to it...

36:31.838 --> 36:33.083
Spock...

36:34.258 --> 36:36.001
- Dig out the information.
- Where is it?

36:39.471 --> 36:42.675
Bones, are you all right?
Bones, answer me!

36:43.476 --> 36:45.100
Bones, what is it?

36:47.188 --> 36:48.979
Bones, what is it?

36:51.025 --> 36:53.102
McCoy, what's happening?

36:53.695 --> 36:55.522
What's happening, McCoy?

37:15.760 --> 37:17.753
You are killers of your friend.

37:17.929 --> 37:19.589
- I will have you put to death.
- Help him.

37:19.764 --> 37:22.137
Until you are dead,
he will think of you and disobey.

37:22.309 --> 37:24.551
- I will see you die!
- Spock, take care of McCoy.

37:54.635 --> 37:57.553
He is not part of our people.

37:57.722 --> 38:00.925
You've released him
from his vow of obedience.

38:01.100 --> 38:05.229
We have freed him
from the cruelty of your Oracle.

38:07.190 --> 38:08.815
Bones.

38:10.694 --> 38:11.974
Bones.

38:12.154 --> 38:15.819
You said something about a book.
Where is it?

38:15.991 --> 38:18.031
They must not know.

38:18.202 --> 38:20.775
The Oracle room.

38:20.955 --> 38:24.205
You will never see the book.
It is sacrilege.

38:24.375 --> 38:28.753
Guards! Guards! Guards!

38:28.922 --> 38:33.548
Now listen to me.
You must listen to what I have to say.

38:36.430 --> 38:38.755
Give me one moment
to speak to you.

38:38.932 --> 38:41.091
One moment. Natira.

38:41.268 --> 38:44.472
If you don't believe what I'm about
to tell you, you can call the guards.

38:44.647 --> 38:47.482
We'll accept
any punishment you decree.

38:48.317 --> 38:49.432
What do you wish to say?

38:49.610 --> 38:52.066
You must believe that
what I'm about to tell you is the truth.

38:52.238 --> 38:53.982
Your truth. Of your world.

38:54.157 --> 38:57.277
Yes, my world
and your world of Yonada.

38:57.452 --> 38:59.279
You do not obey the law
of the creators.

38:59.454 --> 39:00.949
How can you understand my world?

39:01.123 --> 39:03.614
I understand.

39:04.793 --> 39:06.952
I understand, Natira.

39:09.173 --> 39:14.547
Ten thousand years ago,
a sun was dying, and with it, its world.

39:14.721 --> 39:18.172
It's the world you see on the plaque
in the room of the Oracle.

39:18.349 --> 39:20.473
That is the world
of which Yonada is a part.

39:20.644 --> 39:21.842
No.

39:23.230 --> 39:27.358
It is the world of your ancestors,
your creators.

39:27.526 --> 39:29.151
It no longer exists.

39:31.488 --> 39:32.817
You are mad.

39:32.990 --> 39:36.110
No, I'm not. Listen to me!
Hear me out.

39:38.496 --> 39:42.957
When your ancestors
discovered that their world was dying,

39:44.127 --> 39:50.213
they built a great ship
and chose their best people.

39:50.384 --> 39:54.631
They wished for their race to survive.
They sent the ship out into space.

39:56.432 --> 40:00.560
You wish me to believe
that Yonada is a ship?

40:01.187 --> 40:02.646
Yes.

40:02.814 --> 40:06.230
But we have a sun. It did not die.
And at night I see the stars.

40:06.943 --> 40:08.651
No.

40:10.238 --> 40:13.738
You are living inside a hollow ball.

40:15.244 --> 40:20.238
Your ancestors created it
to take you on a journey.

40:20.416 --> 40:22.076
To a promised new planet.

40:29.926 --> 40:34.090
Why should the truth wait
for you to come to Yonada?

40:34.264 --> 40:37.929
Because a flaw developed in
the controls, and unless we correct it,

40:38.101 --> 40:41.684
Yonada will kill millions of people
and destroy a world it doesn't know.

40:41.855 --> 40:43.729
Why should the truth
be kept from us?

40:43.899 --> 40:47.315
Why should the creators
keep us in darkness?

40:47.486 --> 40:50.024
No. No.

40:50.197 --> 40:51.858
You do not speak the truth.

40:52.033 --> 40:55.367
I believe only the Oracle. I believe...

40:56.120 --> 40:58.576
Let us remove
the Instrument of Obedience,

40:58.748 --> 41:00.124
the way we did for McCoy.

41:02.961 --> 41:04.124
Natira.

41:15.016 --> 41:17.055
Do you think she understood me?

41:28.906 --> 41:31.942
She evidently understood something.
There are no guards to detain us.

41:32.326 --> 41:34.995
You have listened to the words
of the non-believers.

41:35.996 --> 41:37.989
Yes, I have listened.

41:39.083 --> 41:43.829
That was the first transgression.
You felt the pain of warning?

41:44.005 --> 41:46.959
- Yes, I did.
- Why did you listen further?

41:47.133 --> 41:51.297
- They said they spoke the truth.
- Their truth.

41:52.264 --> 41:57.685
- Is truth not truth for all?
- The truth of Yonada is your truth.

41:57.853 --> 42:02.681
There can be no other for you.
Repent your disobedience.

42:02.858 --> 42:06.310
I must know the truth of the world.

42:28.678 --> 42:32.177
Your friends
have told me of your world.

42:32.390 --> 42:34.632
They spoke the truth.

42:35.852 --> 42:37.227
I believe you.

42:38.438 --> 42:44.144
I believe.
The creators kept us in darkness.

42:44.319 --> 42:46.857
There's nothing I can do.

42:47.281 --> 42:51.065
I believe with you, husband.

43:11.265 --> 43:14.764
- Is she all right?
- She will be. I'll stay here with her.

43:14.935 --> 43:16.264
The book is in the monolith.

43:20.942 --> 43:23.267
It is sacrilege to the temple.

43:23.444 --> 43:26.896
We do this for the survival
of the people of Yonada.

43:27.073 --> 43:30.608
You are not believers.
You are forbidden to gaze at the book.

43:30.786 --> 43:33.277
We mean no desecration
to the faith of Yonada.

43:33.455 --> 43:35.163
We must consult the book
to help you.

43:35.332 --> 43:40.041
It is blasphemy. You are forbidden.
The punishment is death.

43:53.310 --> 43:56.097
Temperature 111 degrees
and rising.

43:56.271 --> 43:59.937
- McCoy, how do you open this thing?
- Temperature 115 degrees.

44:00.109 --> 44:05.400
Press the three lower planets
on the left-hand side simultaneously.

44:06.324 --> 44:08.993
120 degrees.

44:12.163 --> 44:14.619
Here. The plan must be in there.

44:16.084 --> 44:18.754
- Is it indexed?
- Yes, it is.

44:19.254 --> 44:20.796
Hurry, Spock.

44:28.431 --> 44:30.673
It refers to the altar.

44:34.312 --> 44:37.728
Apply pressure to the centre
until it opens.

44:59.964 --> 45:04.543
- Get her out of the heat.
- I've neutralised the heating elements.

45:05.887 --> 45:08.343
We'll be all right here, now, Jim.

45:15.856 --> 45:18.526
The Oracle can no longer punish us.

45:18.693 --> 45:22.144
- Your friends have prevented it?
- Yes.

45:22.655 --> 45:26.071
And will they send this ship,

45:26.242 --> 45:29.030
again to the land
the creators intended?

45:29.454 --> 45:30.735
Yes.

45:32.582 --> 45:34.242
That is good.

45:36.503 --> 45:39.837
Active and functional.
Not too different from the Enterprise.

45:40.007 --> 45:44.135
There seems to be a weakness
in one of the eight tubes.

45:44.303 --> 45:46.545
- Enough to turn it off course?
- Yes.

45:46.722 --> 45:49.048
Let me check that engine.

45:56.441 --> 45:59.941
A very simple problem,
easy to correct.

46:03.574 --> 46:04.902
Then come.

46:07.203 --> 46:10.239
- No.
- Don't be afraid.

46:10.414 --> 46:13.499
I do not fear
the punishment of disobedience.

46:13.668 --> 46:17.452
- Well, then come, we must hurry...
- No, I cannot go with you.

46:17.630 --> 46:19.374
It is not fear.

46:20.258 --> 46:24.007
I understand the great purpose
of the creators.

46:24.179 --> 46:25.460
I shall honour it.

46:26.974 --> 46:30.058
You intend to stay here, on Yonada?

46:31.520 --> 46:37.476
I shall stay willingly,
and because that is what I must do.

46:39.821 --> 46:41.944
Then I won't leave you.

46:44.451 --> 46:47.986
Will McCoy stay here to die?

46:48.330 --> 46:55.128
No, McCoy will not let go of life
in the fullness of years.

46:55.671 --> 46:59.336
Now, more than ever,
I wish to search through the universe.

46:59.509 --> 47:02.759
To find a cure for myself
and all others like me.

47:03.638 --> 47:05.346
And I want you to be with me.

47:09.853 --> 47:12.771
This is my universe.

47:14.691 --> 47:17.479
You came here with a great mission.

47:17.653 --> 47:20.191
To save my people.

47:20.406 --> 47:23.027
Shall I abandon them?

47:28.456 --> 47:32.537
Perhaps one day, if it is permitted,

47:32.711 --> 47:35.498
you will find Yonada again.

47:44.890 --> 47:48.556
I believe we can attempt
the course correction, captain.

47:49.562 --> 47:50.973
Good.

47:58.238 --> 48:00.527
Going back to marked headings.

48:02.034 --> 48:03.825
Guidance controls taking over.

48:03.994 --> 48:07.494
I believe we can allow the ship
to go back to its automatic control.

48:07.665 --> 48:11.200
Steadying on course marked in red.

48:15.089 --> 48:16.632
Captain.

48:17.383 --> 48:19.423
Intelligence files.

48:19.594 --> 48:23.378
Their banks contain
the total knowledge of the Fabrini,

48:23.557 --> 48:27.720
ready for the people to consult
when they arrive at their destination.

48:28.020 --> 48:32.765
And they seem to have amassed
a great deal of medical knowledge.

48:58.969 --> 49:02.303
Excellent, doctor. The white corpuscle
count is back to normal.

49:09.814 --> 49:11.854
Your haemoglobin count
is back to normal, doctor,

49:12.025 --> 49:15.359
which indicates that the flow of oxygen
to each cell of your body

49:15.529 --> 49:20.108
is back up
to its abundantly energetic level.

49:20.284 --> 49:23.949
Thank you, Mr. Spock, for bringing
back the knowledge of the Fabrini.

49:24.789 --> 49:28.288
Dr. McCoy, the Fabrini descendants
are scheduled to debark

49:28.459 --> 49:31.828
on their promised planet
in approximately 390 days.

49:32.005 --> 49:37.000
I think that we could manage
to be in that vicinity at that time.

49:37.177 --> 49:41.804
If you wanted to thank the Fabrini
personally.
