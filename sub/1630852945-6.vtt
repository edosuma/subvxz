11:17.077 --> 11:18.243
Dallas:
Nah. He one of them

11:18.345 --> 11:21.312
niggas who got one
very strong arm.

11:21.415 --> 11:23.815
-You trying to get us killed?
-(smacks lips) fuck him.

11:23.917 --> 11:27.218
That was a bold move
you pulled today.

11:29.356 --> 11:31.222
The water works
at the crime scene.

11:31.324 --> 11:33.124
(chuckles)

11:33.226 --> 11:34.859
get you out of
speeding tickets, too?

11:34.961 --> 11:37.195
(chuckles)

11:37.297 --> 11:39.097
more than that.

11:41.702 --> 11:43.735
My mom was a con woman.

11:46.473 --> 11:48.540
She used to take me around
the country, even the world,

11:48.642 --> 11:51.076
working jobs. Sometimes,
I'd get to participate.

11:51.178 --> 11:52.744
You're kidding me.

11:52.846 --> 11:54.212
It wasn't all that bad.

11:54.314 --> 11:57.615
-I got to travel a lot.
-(chuckles)

11:57.718 --> 12:00.251
and spent a few years
hiding out in paris.

12:00.353 --> 12:03.354
<i>Je parle couramment le français.</i>

12:03.457 --> 12:06.891
I've falsified documents
in english and in french.

12:06.993 --> 12:09.260
(laughs)

12:09.362 --> 12:12.197
here I thought
you were just a normal lawyer.

12:12.299 --> 12:13.732
(both laugh)

12:13.834 --> 12:15.734
well, I am now.

12:19.372 --> 12:20.905
And your mom?

12:21.007 --> 12:23.007
Oh, who knows.

12:24.544 --> 12:26.578
Tulsa. Boise.

12:26.680 --> 12:27.946
Chicago.

12:29.850 --> 12:32.050
How does that work, I wonder?

12:33.920 --> 12:36.121
Getting your daughter
into that life?

12:36.223 --> 12:37.589
I'll tell you how mine did it.

12:37.691 --> 12:40.925
Took me to the del mar fair
after my dad died.

12:41.027 --> 12:43.762
We didn't even go on any rides.
She just taught me how

12:43.864 --> 12:46.364
-to scam the carnies.
-(laughs)

12:46.466 --> 12:50.301
all the loopholes
of ring toss, hmm.

12:50.403 --> 12:52.937
-Tubs of fun.
-Mm. (chuckles)

12:53.039 --> 12:56.875
the first time we had fun
since the funeral.

12:56.977 --> 13:00.812
We never wanted to
leave that feeling,

13:00.914 --> 13:02.947
so we didn't.

13:03.049 --> 13:04.983
It started out fun.

13:06.720 --> 13:08.253
Then, not so much.

13:10.056 --> 13:12.524
I tried to heal myself
from the past

13:12.626 --> 13:15.693
before it swallowed me.

13:15.796 --> 13:18.930
Or maybe I was just trying
to outrun it.

13:19.032 --> 13:22.500
But, hey, here I am,

13:22.602 --> 13:24.669
back at the beginning.

13:26.973 --> 13:29.340
(chuckles) my hand's shaking.

13:40.453 --> 13:44.455
Look. Hold up, hold up. There.

13:45.992 --> 13:47.258
House on the right.

13:47.360 --> 13:50.128
Get behind the wheel.
Keep it running.

14:00.207 --> 14:02.373
You try anything,
I'm blasting you.

14:08.915 --> 14:09.981
The money's back there.

14:10.083 --> 14:12.116
-In the garage.
-Tavio: Then go get it.

14:15.789 --> 14:18.156
Tavio:
<i> ¿qué vergas es esto?</i>

14:18.258 --> 14:20.391
What the fuck?

14:23.864 --> 14:25.763
Where's the fucking money?

14:25.866 --> 14:28.666
-(growling)
-(screaming)

14:35.842 --> 14:37.675
-(crunching)
-(tiger growling)

14:41.381 --> 14:43.248
the fuck out the car.

14:46.920 --> 14:48.052
So...

14:48.154 --> 14:50.388
Just got off the phone
with jerome.

14:50.490 --> 14:52.257
Franklin is alive.

14:53.260 --> 14:54.425
Stranded in east l.A.

14:54.527 --> 14:57.295
-Oh, my god.
-Jerome's gonna get him now.

14:57.397 --> 14:59.097
Dallas:
That mean we can go now?

14:59.199 --> 15:01.299
Our sitter's about to leave.

15:01.401 --> 15:03.635
Hop on the phone upstairs,
extend your sitter.

15:03.737 --> 15:05.069
Then call up your people,
see who

15:05.171 --> 15:07.705
the streets are saying
did these hits.

15:07.807 --> 15:09.274
Y'all need anything?

15:09.376 --> 15:11.242
No.

15:11.344 --> 15:13.378
Louie:
I'm-a go make some calls myself.

15:13.480 --> 15:16.247
Thank you, louie.

15:16.349 --> 15:17.916
Mm-hmm.

15:20.420 --> 15:22.253
(sighs)

15:22.355 --> 15:24.589
thank god, thank god.

15:26.259 --> 15:28.927
Veronique, I need
to say something to you.

15:30.263 --> 15:32.664
Of course.

15:32.766 --> 15:36.067
I love my son very much.
Whatever his faults are,

15:36.169 --> 15:39.470
he's mine, and I decided
a long time ago

15:39.572 --> 15:42.640
that I would do whatever I could
to try to protect him,

15:42.742 --> 15:44.876
even if that means
telling him things

15:44.978 --> 15:47.879
he didn't want to hear.

15:47.981 --> 15:50.515
Your baby almost lost its life.

15:50.617 --> 15:54.385
And whether it was the gangsters
or the government to blame,

15:54.487 --> 15:56.988
it will happen again.

15:57.090 --> 15:58.589
That's this life.

16:19.379 --> 16:20.545
Hey, nephew.

16:20.647 --> 16:23.047
You all right?

16:23.149 --> 16:25.850
No. Y'all got hit, too?

16:25.952 --> 16:27.852
Took out one of avi's guys.

16:29.489 --> 16:31.289
You find peaches?

16:31.391 --> 16:33.491
Come on, get the fuck
out of here.

16:35.762 --> 16:36.861
Clever, right?

16:36.963 --> 16:38.863
Go ahead and figure your way
the fuck out now.

16:52.178 --> 16:54.412
It's been like
a fucking hour, holmes.

16:56.549 --> 16:58.416
This these fools bounced
with the<i> feria?</i>

16:58.518 --> 17:01.019
<i> -Chale,</i> you think?
-(groans)

17:01.121 --> 17:02.887
hey,<i> vato.</i>

17:02.989 --> 17:05.123
How much money
were you carrying?

17:05.225 --> 17:06.791
$3 million.

17:06.893 --> 17:08.926
Fuck this shit, holmes!
We're getting played.

17:09.029 --> 17:10.261
Come on, let's go.

17:11.765 --> 17:14.766
You're gonna take us
to the bags,

17:14.868 --> 17:17.068
or you're gonna get blasted.

17:17.170 --> 17:19.404
-(vehicle approaching)
<i> -ahí están.</i>

17:19.506 --> 17:19.637
Hey,<i> carnal.</i>

17:22.275 --> 17:24.509
-(grunts, mutters)
-get the fuck on the ground.

17:24.611 --> 17:27.078
Get the fuck on the ground!

17:31.985 --> 17:34.018
(laughing)

17:36.823 --> 17:38.756
sorry I took so long.

17:41.361 --> 17:44.662
Had to have a conversation
with a tiger.

17:44.764 --> 17:47.899
(both chuckle)

18:00.280 --> 18:02.246
thank you.

18:03.750 --> 18:05.016
(grunts)

18:05.118 --> 18:07.952
still got your autograph,
oso, huh?

18:08.054 --> 18:09.287
Oh...

18:09.389 --> 18:10.788
(both chuckle)

18:10.890 --> 18:13.758
hey, what y'all want to do
with these<i> eses?</i>

18:19.332 --> 18:21.566
<i> Vámonos pa' la casa.</i>

18:25.572 --> 18:28.272
Let's go home.

18:28.374 --> 18:30.708
-(door opens)
-damn.

18:32.412 --> 18:34.278
Y'all got lucky today.

18:36.049 --> 18:37.515
Let's rock.

18:37.617 --> 18:40.418
Franklin:
Three coordinated hits.

18:40.520 --> 18:43.121
I didn't see any of them coming.

18:43.223 --> 18:46.858
People hide who they are,

18:46.960 --> 18:48.860
but, sooner or later,

18:48.962 --> 18:50.228
they show it.

18:50.330 --> 18:51.996
I didn't believe
you were coming back.

18:52.098 --> 18:54.298
Don't trust people.

18:54.400 --> 18:57.135
Yeah. I don't blame you.

18:59.072 --> 19:01.005
Shit, I didn't trust you, too.

19:01.107 --> 19:03.207
(chuckles)

19:03.309 --> 19:06.878
(both laugh)

19:06.980 --> 19:09.514
especially after
you and teddy spied on me.

19:11.951 --> 19:13.584
What?

19:13.686 --> 19:15.253
Franklin:
At the first drop.

19:15.355 --> 19:17.455
First one when teddy came back.

19:20.393 --> 19:22.293
Had a feeling, so, you know,

19:22.395 --> 19:25.530
I went back to the spot.
Found some evidence

19:25.632 --> 19:27.498
in the building.

19:27.600 --> 19:30.268
He was watching, listening.

19:33.773 --> 19:35.006
You really didn't know?

19:44.817 --> 19:45.917
-(bag thuds)
-we good?

19:46.019 --> 19:48.052
We're good.

19:49.122 --> 19:50.922
(sighs)

19:51.024 --> 19:53.491
never coming back
to this fucking place again.

19:56.996 --> 19:58.262
(engine starts)

20:04.170 --> 20:05.403
(brakes squeal)

20:05.505 --> 20:07.538
(tiger growling)

20:26.109 --> 20:27.742
come on,<i> güey.</i>

20:27.844 --> 20:29.877
It's a good day to start,
<i> cabrón.</i>

20:34.083 --> 20:35.449
Mmm.

20:37.186 --> 20:38.319
(sighs)

20:38.421 --> 20:40.421
-you're gonna need stitches.
-(door opens)

20:40.523 --> 20:42.390
you have a needle and thread?

20:47.664 --> 20:49.697
(groans) oh...

20:49.799 --> 20:51.832
(chuckling)

20:53.202 --> 20:55.269
-oh!
-You asshole.

20:55.371 --> 20:57.572
-I thought you were dead.
-(laughs)

21:04.314 --> 21:06.213
such a funny man.

21:06.316 --> 21:08.149
-You know what's not funny?
-What?

21:08.251 --> 21:11.385
Thinking you left me alone with
those<i> pinches</i> kids, gustavo.

21:11.487 --> 21:13.454
(laughs)

21:13.556 --> 21:15.156
I would never.

21:15.258 --> 21:16.524
Franklin:
Y'all should head home.

21:18.027 --> 21:20.061
Get some rest, oso.

21:21.664 --> 21:23.331
<i> A huevo.</i>

21:25.535 --> 21:27.935
Good luck with your boy.

21:28.037 --> 21:29.537
<i> A huevo.</i>

21:29.639 --> 21:32.373
-(sighs)
-hear from teddy,

21:32.475 --> 21:34.241
you let me know, all right?

21:34.344 --> 21:36.410
Okay.

21:36.512 --> 21:37.445
Thank you.

21:37.547 --> 21:39.113
Yes, of course.

21:41.718 --> 21:43.117
Still ain't seen peaches?

21:43.219 --> 21:44.986
I got renny outside his crib,
in case he show up.

21:45.088 --> 21:47.321
Black diamond:
I'm telling y'all,
put us on the street.

21:47.423 --> 21:49.323
We no good sitting around.

21:49.425 --> 21:51.826
You want peaches found,
we can find him.

21:51.928 --> 21:53.260
It ain't peaches, all right?

21:54.297 --> 21:56.330
Keep an eye on them.

21:57.734 --> 21:59.467
Hey, I'll be right back,
all right?

21:59.569 --> 22:00.668
Cissy:
You're not going somewhere,
are you?

22:00.770 --> 22:03.437
Just got to check on something.

22:03.539 --> 22:05.806
Whoever this was,

22:05.908 --> 22:07.375
they're not coming
after us again tonight.

22:07.477 --> 22:09.844
I think I'll head home.

22:09.946 --> 22:11.712
I'll get d to drive you home.

22:11.814 --> 22:13.481
No, no, no. I'll manage.

22:13.583 --> 22:16.384
You just said they wouldn't
come after us again.

22:16.486 --> 22:18.152
Besides,
the last time deon drove,

22:18.254 --> 22:21.322
he sang the whole way
over the radio.

22:21.424 --> 22:23.824
This day's been loud enough
as it is, you know?

22:23.926 --> 22:26.661
Hey, uh...

22:26.763 --> 22:29.330
Page me when you make it,
all right?

22:29.432 --> 22:31.265
I'll be home soon, we'll talk.

22:31.367 --> 22:32.967
-Okay?
-Mm-hmm.

22:41.377 --> 22:44.045

22:44.147 --> 22:46.947
if this was peaches,

25:04.887 --> 25:06.921
Ain't been that tight in years.

25:08.491 --> 25:10.457
I couldn't tell you.

25:10.560 --> 25:12.293
Louie:
This wasn't no impulsive move.

25:12.395 --> 25:14.829
If he did do this,
ain't no way he stuck around.

25:14.931 --> 25:17.031
He didn't do it alone, neither.

25:17.133 --> 25:18.666
We find who he used
to come at us,

25:18.768 --> 25:20.067
maybe they'll lead us to him.

25:20.169 --> 25:22.169
Till we know for sure,
we got to be careful.

25:22.271 --> 25:24.038
I'm tired.

25:24.140 --> 25:26.140
Going home.

25:26.242 --> 25:28.275
See y'all tomorrow.

25:47.563 --> 25:49.597
♪ ♪

25:56.973 --> 25:59.006
vee?

26:07.483 --> 26:09.316
Baby?

26:24.400 --> 26:26.433
♪ ♪

26:42.551 --> 26:44.585
fuck!

26:51.627 --> 26:53.260
She left you?

26:53.362 --> 26:55.429
Yeah.

26:55.531 --> 26:57.798
And she's pregnant?

26:57.900 --> 27:00.601
Ten weeks.

27:00.703 --> 27:02.803
It's god's gift
and his challenge, too.

27:02.905 --> 27:04.772
I have to keep them safe.

27:04.874 --> 27:07.641
-Avi, you understand?
-Don't worry.

27:07.743 --> 27:09.576
I can have a few men...

27:09.679 --> 27:11.578
Maybe a woman...

27:11.681 --> 27:13.714
You know, to be closer.

27:15.918 --> 27:18.118
Professionals, good people.

27:18.220 --> 27:20.087
Very good.

27:22.491 --> 27:24.391
Thank you.

27:24.493 --> 27:26.727
Yeah.

27:26.829 --> 27:29.196
My friend azim

27:29.298 --> 27:32.633
was shot down yesterday
right here.

27:32.735 --> 27:34.768
Died at my feet.

27:36.205 --> 27:38.439
And here you are...

27:40.576 --> 27:42.710
...Bringing life to the world.

27:42.812 --> 27:44.712
I never married.

27:44.814 --> 27:46.714
Never had a child.

27:46.816 --> 27:48.716
Because I'm a soldier.

27:48.818 --> 27:50.818
Always a soldier.

27:50.920 --> 27:53.554
I go from one battlefield
to another.

27:53.656 --> 27:55.055
It's what I do.

27:55.157 --> 27:56.623
It's what I am.

27:56.726 --> 27:58.459
But you?

27:58.561 --> 28:01.295
You're not like me.

28:01.397 --> 28:03.130
How'd you see that?

28:03.232 --> 28:04.665
First time I met you

28:04.767 --> 28:06.500
I said to myself,

28:06.602 --> 28:09.470
this young man can do
anything he wants.

28:11.607 --> 28:14.441
And that's the biggest curse
a man can have.

28:14.543 --> 28:16.210
A curse?

28:16.312 --> 28:18.178
I have no choice.

28:18.280 --> 28:20.214
I do what I am.

28:20.316 --> 28:22.883
But you?

28:22.985 --> 28:25.853
You could do anything.

28:25.955 --> 28:28.589
You could<i> be</i> anything.

28:29.759 --> 28:32.126
A teacher, a businessman,

28:32.228 --> 28:34.595
a rabbi...

28:34.697 --> 28:37.297
A drug dealer.

28:37.400 --> 28:39.700
It's all in you.

28:39.802 --> 28:41.835
It all wants to come out.

28:42.805 --> 28:44.838
I go from war to war.

28:46.442 --> 28:48.976
Whereas a man like you

28:49.078 --> 28:51.111
has the war inside.

29:01.857 --> 29:04.825
Jerome:
All the shit
I've done for this nigga.

29:04.927 --> 29:06.827
He was a broke-down fucking vet

29:06.929 --> 29:08.962
before I put him on.

29:10.599 --> 29:12.933
Never believe he'd do
some shit like this to us.

29:13.035 --> 29:15.402
You might've brought him in,
but he was franklin's guy.

29:15.504 --> 29:18.539
If anybody should've seen
this coming, it's him.

29:22.511 --> 29:24.545
Come on.

29:37.493 --> 29:39.093
Heard y'all had a bad day.

29:39.195 --> 29:41.028
Jerome:
Yeah, what else you heard?

29:41.130 --> 29:42.930
Like who did the shooting?

29:43.032 --> 29:45.699
Fuck we look like?
Shaft and company?

29:45.801 --> 29:47.334
I'm just asking you
to keep your ear to the ground.

29:47.436 --> 29:49.002
It was big hit,
a lot of people involved.

29:49.105 --> 29:50.437
Somebody gonna talk.

29:50.539 --> 29:51.839
Yeah, all right.

29:51.941 --> 29:52.940
What about that drop though?

29:53.042 --> 29:54.942
You heard what she said, right?

29:55.044 --> 29:56.710
Nigga, I just said all right.

29:56.812 --> 29:59.379
But trey want
to know about the drop.

29:59.482 --> 30:01.215
How about you get the drop
when I say

30:01.317 --> 30:03.550
you get the motherfucking drop,
how about that then, nigga?

30:03.652 --> 30:06.153
You know what, y'all should try
to be a little more respectful.

30:06.255 --> 30:09.556
'cause then maybe niggas won't
try to light y'all asses up.

30:09.658 --> 30:11.992
-Back the fuck up.
-Jerome: The fuck?

30:12.094 --> 30:14.194
(grunting, muttering)

30:16.065 --> 30:18.232
fucking what, nigga?!

30:18.334 --> 30:20.367
(grunts, winces)

30:29.044 --> 30:31.445
go ahead and pick up your boy.

30:31.547 --> 30:34.148
Pick him up.

30:35.985 --> 30:37.117
(car door closes)

30:37.219 --> 30:39.253
(engine starts)

30:39.355 --> 30:41.355
teach your man how to squabble!

30:42.358 --> 30:44.224
You get that trigger next time,
nigga.

30:44.326 --> 30:45.792
(tires squeal)

30:45.895 --> 30:47.594
parissa:
Up.

30:47.696 --> 30:49.429
Come.

30:50.766 --> 30:53.600
Slow this time, slow, go-- okay.

30:53.702 --> 30:56.170
Goddamn it!

30:56.272 --> 30:59.907
Oh! There we go.

31:02.211 --> 31:03.577
(sighs)

31:03.679 --> 31:05.546
I need to use your phone.

31:06.949 --> 31:08.882
Call my people.

31:08.984 --> 31:11.018
Find out what the fallout is.

31:11.120 --> 31:13.220
The fallout from what?

31:13.322 --> 31:15.689
I still don't know the story.

31:17.726 --> 31:20.227
I was meeting with an asset,

31:20.329 --> 31:22.196
and we were attacked...

31:22.298 --> 31:25.032
Fuck me...

31:28.971 --> 31:30.938
Who would attack you?

31:34.109 --> 31:36.143
Well, they weren't after me.

31:38.714 --> 31:42.015
I read an article in
the<i> herald examiner</i> last year.

31:43.886 --> 31:45.986
Around the time you disappeared.

31:46.989 --> 31:49.122
About a cia officer

31:49.225 --> 31:51.792
who was smuggling cocaine

31:51.894 --> 31:53.827
into the country

31:53.929 --> 31:55.963
to fund the contras.

31:57.433 --> 32:00.534
Pretty sure
that story was retracted.

32:05.007 --> 32:07.174
What do you want?

32:07.276 --> 32:09.843
Other than my $500,000?

32:09.945 --> 32:12.045
-250k.
-That was before

32:12.147 --> 32:14.448
I found the 300 kilos
in the back of your car.

32:14.550 --> 32:16.450
I counted.

32:16.552 --> 32:18.018
Well, other than the money,

32:18.120 --> 32:20.921
what do you want?

32:24.627 --> 32:26.727
Parissa:
Two days ago,

32:26.829 --> 32:29.463
I would've just been happy to...

32:29.565 --> 32:32.165
Quit the hospital.

32:33.168 --> 32:34.534
No more...

32:34.637 --> 32:37.037
"hey, paki,
help me take a shit?"

32:51.353 --> 32:52.919
what are you doing?

32:59.128 --> 33:02.763
I have wanted to do that
ever since tehran.

33:02.865 --> 33:05.632
But you were in love.

33:05.734 --> 33:07.768
Then you were married.

33:10.406 --> 33:13.173
The last two days have

33:13.275 --> 33:15.575
been the most fun
I've had in years.

33:17.846 --> 33:20.147
So maybe that's what I want.

33:26.789 --> 33:28.822
I'll bring in the phone.

33:41.370 --> 33:43.837
(door opens, closes)

33:43.939 --> 33:46.306
the first sonogram,
we're just exploring.

33:46.408 --> 33:48.508
And I suggest

33:48.610 --> 33:51.478
you lay down any expectation
you came in with.

33:51.580 --> 33:54.648
We might find out there's twins.

33:54.750 --> 33:57.351
We also might find
there's no heartbeat.

33:57.453 --> 33:58.985
Ready?

33:59.088 --> 34:00.821
Yes, ma'am.

34:04.093 --> 34:07.094
-Sorry.
-Technician: They were
ready a little early.

34:07.196 --> 34:09.196
-It's fine.
-Technician: We were
just about to start.

34:09.298 --> 34:11.131
Do you mind getting the lights?

34:11.233 --> 34:13.834
-Okay, lift that shirt for me.
-Okay.

34:15.671 --> 34:17.738
(veronique moans)

34:17.840 --> 34:19.573
oops, oh, sorry.

34:19.675 --> 34:21.708
Little cold.

34:30.185 --> 34:32.686
And we've got...

34:33.655 --> 34:36.790
...One little baby.

34:40.529 --> 34:43.163
Now let's check for a heartbeat.

34:44.800 --> 34:46.833
(rhythmic beating echoes)

34:53.509 --> 34:56.009
congratulations.

35:03.786 --> 35:05.419
Could we have a minute?

35:05.521 --> 35:07.821
-Of course.
-Thank you.

35:22.137 --> 35:26.239
(door opens, closes)

35:26.341 --> 35:27.941
you know, I...

35:28.043 --> 35:30.577
Wish you had said something,
instead of

35:30.679 --> 35:32.712
just taking off like that.

35:35.050 --> 35:37.150
You would've tried
to convince me to stay,

35:37.252 --> 35:39.286
and I didn't want to argue.

35:40.522 --> 35:42.823
I don't blame you
for what happened.

35:42.925 --> 35:45.325
You told me who you were.

35:45.427 --> 35:48.395
I'm the one who let myself think
this couldn't touch me.

35:48.497 --> 35:51.097
Saw avi this morning.

35:51.200 --> 35:53.767
You'll have security
starting tomorrow.

35:53.869 --> 35:56.570
Did you find out
who came after you yet?

35:58.540 --> 36:00.140
No.

36:00.242 --> 36:01.741
But we'll find them.

36:01.844 --> 36:03.410
I'll take care of this.

36:04.646 --> 36:06.446
Maybe this time.

36:06.548 --> 36:08.548
What about next time, huh?

36:08.650 --> 36:11.051
What about when the cia decides
they're done with you?

36:11.153 --> 36:13.386
The cia?
Where's this coming from?

36:13.489 --> 36:15.522
It doesn't matter.

36:17.426 --> 36:19.960
You said you could keep me safe.

36:20.963 --> 36:22.696
But you can't.

36:22.798 --> 36:25.031
So now...

36:25.133 --> 36:27.467
Now?

36:27.569 --> 36:29.703
I have to keep
some distance from you

36:29.805 --> 36:31.505
until you're actually
free from all this.

36:31.607 --> 36:33.640
"distance"?

36:35.143 --> 36:37.177
What does that even mean?

36:39.715 --> 36:42.315
It means I'll see you at work.

36:45.754 --> 36:48.088
But nothing else.

36:50.526 --> 36:52.926
Please?

36:55.731 --> 36:57.631
Nurse?

36:57.733 --> 36:59.266
We're ready.

36:59.368 --> 37:01.801
(door opens, closes)

37:08.810 --> 37:10.844
black diamond:
Y'all may have a bigger
problem than peaches.

37:10.946 --> 37:12.145
How's that?

37:12.247 --> 37:13.947
We're hearing another name.

37:14.049 --> 37:16.349
Some o.G. Motherfucker,
just got out the pen.

37:16.451 --> 37:18.218
Name's kane.

37:19.221 --> 37:21.755
-Kane?
-It's got to be him, right?

37:21.857 --> 37:23.189
Hadn't heard he was out.

37:23.292 --> 37:24.524
Franklin:
Me, neither.

37:24.626 --> 37:26.259
Been long enough though.

37:26.361 --> 37:28.228
Dallas:
We ain't telepathic.

37:28.330 --> 37:31.164
Somebody want to tell us
who the fuck kane is?

37:32.668 --> 37:34.034
<i> (whistle blows)</i>

37:34.136 --> 37:35.936
coach:
I want to see hustle!

37:36.038 --> 37:38.104
I want to see hustle, I want
to see motivation, come on now!

37:38.206 --> 37:40.040
(cheering and applause)

37:40.142 --> 37:41.708

37:45.447 --> 37:47.881
Back into position one,

Hustle up!

37:49.985 --> 37:51.818

Go ahead.

37:53.121 --> 37:55.355
Justin:
Y'all niggas better act right.

38:01.330 --> 38:04.264
(kane chuckles)

38:04.366 --> 38:08.034
lil' lee and frankie.

38:09.137 --> 38:10.837
Didn't think y'all
would find me this quick.

38:10.939 --> 38:12.405
Good for you.

38:12.507 --> 38:14.608
What's up, kane?

38:14.710 --> 38:16.910
When did you get out?

38:17.012 --> 38:18.612
Few months ago.

38:18.714 --> 38:21.047
You couldn't look us up?

38:21.149 --> 38:23.249
Come on, nigga,
you know how shit go.

38:23.352 --> 38:26.219
Lot of people to see,
things to do.

38:27.589 --> 38:29.756
Broken family to look after.

38:29.858 --> 38:31.891
Old friends to shoot at?

38:31.994 --> 38:33.393
Kane:
Old friends?

38:33.495 --> 38:35.595
More like little brothers,
nigga. (chuckles)

38:36.732 --> 38:38.665
come on, you remember
when you and lee

38:38.767 --> 38:40.800
weren't much bigger than them.

38:42.070 --> 38:44.738
And his mama dragged him out
of that pool hall by his ear?

38:44.840 --> 38:47.140
That wasn't leon.

38:47.242 --> 38:49.075
That was me.

38:50.278 --> 38:51.678
Hmm.

38:51.780 --> 38:53.113
Shit, now that I think about it,

38:53.215 --> 38:55.081
you right about that.

38:55.183 --> 38:58.151
Yeah, more power to mrs. Saint
for trying to raise you right.

38:58.253 --> 39:00.787
You know you took a shot
at her, too, right?

39:00.889 --> 39:03.023
Technically,
I ain't shoot at anyone.

39:04.726 --> 39:06.393
What I'm wondering is...

39:06.495 --> 39:09.162
Did peaches come at you or...

39:09.264 --> 39:11.731
Did you get at him?

39:16.838 --> 39:19.973
You know what? I taught
you boys a lot of things.

39:20.075 --> 39:22.442
Thought I taught you to
behave like men.

39:22.544 --> 39:23.843
But I guess
that shit didn't keep.

39:23.945 --> 39:26.146
Oh, it did.
It's exactly why we're here

39:26.248 --> 39:28.348
having this conversation

39:28.450 --> 39:31.484
rather than wiping out you
and everybody else you got left.

39:31.586 --> 39:33.853
You know...

39:33.955 --> 39:36.222
When I heard
about my little cousin delroy

39:36.324 --> 39:38.692
getting stabbed
while slinging for you...

39:40.128 --> 39:41.828
...I was in solitary.

39:41.930 --> 39:43.563
(chuckles)

39:43.665 --> 39:46.166
wouldn't even let me out
for the funeral.

39:46.268 --> 39:49.169
Then I heard about kev.

39:49.271 --> 39:52.105
And I didn't want
to go to the funeral.

39:53.508 --> 39:55.575
Would've been too angry.

39:55.677 --> 39:56.943
Done something crazy.

39:57.045 --> 39:59.112
Probably added more time.

39:59.214 --> 40:01.681
So I just sat

40:01.783 --> 40:03.983
and waited it out, patient-like.

40:04.086 --> 40:05.885
-You don't know what
really happened.
-No?

40:05.987 --> 40:09.155
You didn't shoot and kill
my baby brother?

40:10.892 --> 40:13.693
Did I get that wrong, frankie?

40:14.830 --> 40:17.664
And then what'd you do?

40:17.766 --> 40:19.566
Show me the proper respect,

40:19.668 --> 40:21.367
and say it to my face, nigga.

40:21.470 --> 40:23.002
I was in prison.

40:23.105 --> 40:25.038
Yeah, well, I was
wondering about that shit, too.

40:25.140 --> 40:27.240
Who you snitch on to get out?

40:27.342 --> 40:28.608
If you had a problem,
you should've

40:28.710 --> 40:29.909
just come and spoken to us.

40:30.011 --> 40:32.078
(laughing)

40:32.180 --> 40:34.781
listen to gucci shoes-- yo, lee,

40:34.883 --> 40:36.382
you better get your man,
look at him telling me

40:36.485 --> 40:38.218
what the fuck I should've done.

40:39.221 --> 40:41.054
What, you gonna tell me
the same?

40:41.156 --> 40:43.623
We just want
to make this shit right.

40:43.725 --> 40:46.760
Well, unfortunately,
some things can be made right.

40:46.862 --> 40:49.462
And some can't.

40:49.564 --> 40:52.031
But I do...

40:52.134 --> 40:55.135
Sincerely apologize
if shit got out of hand and...

40:55.237 --> 40:58.571
Mrs. Saint and anybody else
got caught up in it.

40:59.941 --> 41:02.275
That's all on me.

41:02.377 --> 41:05.378
Next time I'm gonna
have better people.

41:06.715 --> 41:08.882
Next time we get it right.

41:09.851 --> 41:13.686
You know, we can come at you
at anytime, anyplace.

41:15.490 --> 41:18.892
This is your one chance
to do things a different way.

41:18.994 --> 41:21.761
Of course you can get at me,
franklin.

41:21.863 --> 41:24.664
Does it look like I'm fuckin'
hiding, little nigga?

41:27.169 --> 41:28.568
(chuckles)

41:30.238 --> 41:32.472
you know what?

41:32.574 --> 41:34.974
You little boys run along.

41:35.076 --> 41:37.343
And when I pour one out
on kev's grave,

41:37.445 --> 41:39.646
I'll think of you.

41:41.616 --> 41:43.349
-(whistle blows)
-(crowd cheering)

41:43.451 --> 41:45.919
all right, fellas, let's get it!

41:46.021 --> 41:48.021
Hey, that's my man right there.

41:48.123 --> 41:50.490
I see you, big boy.
All right, hustle!

41:50.592 --> 41:52.859
Hustle! Yes!

41:52.961 --> 41:54.527
Y'all are champions!
