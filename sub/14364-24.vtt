00:00.700 --> 00:03.700
<i>previosly on Transformers Prime...</i>

00:03.701 --> 00:10.626
The planetary alignment to which
the prophecy refers is nearly upon us.

00:16.247 --> 00:18.341
The flaming mountain
in my visions,

00:18.342 --> 00:22.526
the place from whence
I am to harvest Dark Energon!

00:22.701 --> 00:24.502
I need him over here -- now!

00:26.605 --> 00:33.277
Megatron, today you answer for your
crimes against Cybertron and humanity.

00:37.884 --> 00:40.051
Pulse rate is stabilizing.

00:42.989 --> 00:45.790
It seems the blood
of Unicron I've been seeking

00:45.792 --> 00:50.895
is not out there,
but rather right here!

00:52.909 --> 00:56.436
<b>1x24 - One Shall Rise
/ part 1 /</b>

00:58.303 --> 01:01.973
Why is the blood of Unicron

01:01.975 --> 01:04.742
erupting from beneath the Earth?

01:04.744 --> 01:09.113
A question, Optimus, that
you shall take to your grave.

01:29.435 --> 01:33.337
Quickly!
We must pull him through!

01:40.646 --> 01:41.779
Bulk!

01:41.781 --> 01:43.214
Now, now, now!

02:03.135 --> 02:06.704
This is merely the beginning!

02:06.706 --> 02:09.707
I now possess
enough Dark Energon

02:09.709 --> 02:12.844
to reanimate Unicron himself!

02:15.014 --> 02:16.514
Yes!

03:03.407 --> 03:04.673
Easy, Optimus.

03:04.675 --> 03:05.941
From the looks of things,

03:05.943 --> 03:10.112
you've been exposed to a massive
amount of Dark Energon.

03:10.114 --> 03:12.848
I am not the only one.

03:21.023 --> 03:22.524
Hey.

03:22.526 --> 03:24.459
He's lucky to be alive.

03:26.195 --> 03:28.530
Megatron found
more of the dark stuff?

03:28.532 --> 03:30.132
Arcee:
A volcano full.

03:30.134 --> 03:31.867
The question is, "how?"

03:31.869 --> 03:33.001
No.

03:33.003 --> 03:34.970
The question is, "what?"

03:34.972 --> 03:37.572
As in, "what in the world
is the blood of Unicron

03:37.574 --> 03:39.441
doing here on Earth?"

03:39.443 --> 03:41.143
The 'Cons killed a Unicorn?

03:42.678 --> 03:45.013
White horse with
a horn on its head?

03:45.015 --> 03:47.115
Prances around all sparkly?

03:47.117 --> 03:48.884
Unicron --

03:48.886 --> 03:51.453
an ancient evil
whose fossilized blood

03:51.455 --> 03:54.890
comprises the matter
which we call Dark Energon,

03:54.892 --> 03:57.359
as legend would have it.

03:57.361 --> 04:00.562
So, you're saying this Unicron
is some kind of boogeyman?

04:00.564 --> 04:01.897
"Boogeyman"?

04:01.899 --> 04:04.399
Make-believe creepy guy
who hides in your closet.

04:04.401 --> 04:07.102
No, nurse Darby.

04:07.104 --> 04:11.239
Unicron is very real.
Was.

04:11.241 --> 04:14.075
That is, well, I do believe
he once existed.

04:14.077 --> 04:15.811
I just don't subscribe
to the theory

04:15.813 --> 04:19.247
that his primordial life force
is the substance

04:19.249 --> 04:21.516
which... harmed Raf.

04:21.517 --> 04:22.717
I've heard enough.

04:22.719 --> 04:26.221
Jack, please,
help me get raf into the car.

04:28.559 --> 04:30.425
Mom, I thought
he was doing better.

04:30.427 --> 04:33.261
Raf needs to be examined
by real doctors,

04:33.263 --> 04:35.464
and Raf's family needs
to know what's happened.

04:35.466 --> 04:37.966
His real family.

04:37.968 --> 04:42.237
Mom, Raf's family can't protect him,
not like they can.

04:42.239 --> 04:46.241
June, it deeply grieves me
that I have failed.

04:46.243 --> 04:48.710
But I will do everything
in my power

04:48.712 --> 04:53.448
to ensure that no harm
comes to our human friends...

04:53.450 --> 04:56.551
or any human ever again.

04:58.955 --> 05:01.523
Optimus, they're children.

05:01.525 --> 05:03.658
They do not belong
in your world.

05:03.660 --> 05:07.395
They should be worrying
about grades, prom dates, pimples.

05:07.397 --> 05:09.197
Not their own survival!

05:09.199 --> 05:12.100
Mom, Dark Energon
is pouring out of the earth.

05:12.102 --> 05:13.768
It doesn't do that.

05:13.770 --> 05:16.438
This could be about everyone's
survival, not just ours.

05:16.440 --> 05:18.540
You're coming with me,
all three of you,

05:18.542 --> 05:22.878
and they will not
be coming back.

05:22.880 --> 05:25.180
I understand.

05:25.182 --> 05:26.882
That's it?

05:26.884 --> 05:28.984
After all we've been through
together?

05:28.986 --> 05:30.118
"See ya"?

05:30.120 --> 05:32.387
What about our freedom
to choose?

05:32.389 --> 05:36.091
That may fly on their planet
but not here on earth.

05:37.660 --> 05:39.427
Get in.

05:39.429 --> 05:42.797
Do you really expect me to ride
in a non-transforming vehicle?

05:42.799 --> 05:44.900
Miko, I'm serious.

05:44.902 --> 05:46.134
You're not my mother.

05:46.136 --> 05:47.502
Miko!

05:47.504 --> 05:48.670
Neither are you!

05:50.139 --> 05:51.439
Well, I am yours.

05:51.441 --> 05:53.074
Let's go, Jack.

05:57.413 --> 05:59.514
She is your mom.

06:05.721 --> 06:07.956
I'm staying.

06:07.958 --> 06:09.291
I'm sorry.

06:22.438 --> 06:25.140
Ratchet, activate
the ground bridge.

06:25.142 --> 06:26.508
No, thank you.

06:44.360 --> 06:46.294
<i>Prime, do you copy?</i>

06:46.296 --> 06:48.597
I hear you, agent Fowler.

06:48.599 --> 06:49.864
<i>Been watching the news?</i>

06:49.866 --> 06:52.200
<i>Mother nature's got a twitch
in her britches.</i>

06:52.202 --> 06:53.902
We know about the volcano.

06:53.904 --> 06:55.303
<i>And the quakes?</i>

06:55.305 --> 06:58.206
<i>Seven major tumblers
of the exact same magnitude</i>

06:58.208 --> 07:00.842
<i>At the exact same time
as a volcanic eruption</i>

07:00.844 --> 07:03.745
<i>All over the globe
on different tectonic plates,</i>

07:03.747 --> 07:06.781
<i>In theory, unrelated,
if they hadn't happened...</i>

07:06.783 --> 07:09.351
...at the exact same time.

07:09.353 --> 07:11.586
Check it out.
More good news.

07:11.588 --> 07:14.356
<i>Freak storms unlike
any the region has seen.</i>

07:14.358 --> 07:16.691
<i>Tsunamis threaten
the canadian coast</i>

07:16.693 --> 07:19.227
<i>while lightning storms
pummel the Gobi desert.</i>

07:19.229 --> 07:21.730
<i>Meanwhile,
electromagnetic anomalies</i>

07:21.732 --> 07:23.698
<i>plague urban power grids.</i>

07:23.700 --> 07:25.567
<i>These abnormal
global phenomena</i>

07:25.569 --> 07:29.137
<i>are leaving most to wonder
why now and what next.</i>

07:29.139 --> 07:31.940
<i>Don't tell me your 'Cons
have built a weather machine.</i>

07:31.942 --> 07:34.542
One that powerful?
Highly unlikely.

07:34.544 --> 07:37.679
I do not believe
the appearance of Dark Energon

07:37.681 --> 07:41.816
at this point in time
to be coincidental.

07:46.790 --> 07:49.391
1-100, 2-100.

07:49.393 --> 07:51.593
You okay back there, Raf?

07:51.595 --> 07:53.028
I-I saw lightning.

07:53.030 --> 07:54.462
I'm counting
until the thunder --

07:55.666 --> 07:57.532
Looks like a storm.

07:57.534 --> 07:59.267
My garden will love it.

08:16.353 --> 08:17.419
Raf?

08:17.421 --> 08:19.254
- Are you okay?
- Mm-hmm.

08:19.256 --> 08:20.555
What's that?

08:27.063 --> 08:28.196
No!

08:45.147 --> 08:49.050
Come on.
Come on. Come on.

09:29.592 --> 09:31.693
He wants us to climb into his hand!

10:01.757 --> 10:03.458
Thank you.

10:04.627 --> 10:08.730
He says, "you're welcome."

10:24.481 --> 10:28.883
Rivers of your very lifeblood

10:28.885 --> 10:32.854
rising from the depths
to become one with me!

10:52.442 --> 10:54.842
Uh... we're back.

10:56.612 --> 10:58.713
And we are glad.

11:01.550 --> 11:03.184
Are you all right?

11:03.186 --> 11:04.652
I will be.

11:04.654 --> 11:07.021
- Jack...
- Mom, I --

11:07.023 --> 11:09.857
- I know.
- Me too.

11:09.859 --> 11:13.027
But you're grounded
till you're 30.

11:13.029 --> 11:14.028
25.

11:14.030 --> 11:15.329
<i>World leaders</i>

11:15.331 --> 11:17.832
<i>are classifying these
bizarre weather patterns</i>

11:17.834 --> 11:19.667
<i>as a global emergency.</i>

11:19.669 --> 11:20.968
Global?

11:20.970 --> 11:22.837
<i>And scientists
believe the phenomena</i>

11:22.839 --> 11:26.174
<i>to be somehow related to the
current planetary alignment.</i>

11:26.176 --> 11:27.575
What have you learned, Prime?

11:27.577 --> 11:29.844
And you better not
blow smoke up my oven.

11:29.846 --> 11:32.713
Ms. Darby.

11:32.715 --> 11:34.982
What a nice surprise.

11:34.984 --> 11:37.151
Special agent Fowler.

11:37.153 --> 11:38.786
We have learned this --

11:38.788 --> 11:41.622
as with the so-called magma
from the volcano,

11:41.624 --> 11:45.860
these earthquakes originated far below
the Earth's crust,

11:45.862 --> 11:49.964
from the very center
of the Earth's core, in fact.

11:49.966 --> 11:51.466
Quakes don't start there.

11:51.468 --> 11:52.733
Do they?

11:52.735 --> 11:56.604
Tiny tremors rising and failing
in a consistent pattern,

11:56.606 --> 11:58.339
almost like...

12:00.909 --> 12:03.811
by the Allspark!

12:03.813 --> 12:08.483
If I convert these data points
to audio files...

12:08.485 --> 12:10.151
What?
What is it?

12:10.153 --> 12:11.385
Well, listen.

12:32.074 --> 12:34.008
Stop, Soundwave!

12:34.010 --> 12:35.710
Turn it off!

12:35.712 --> 12:39.380
I can still hear it
pounding in my brain!

12:39.382 --> 12:41.215
A cybertronian heartbeat?

12:41.217 --> 12:42.483
How is that possible?

12:42.485 --> 12:43.951
A heart pumps blood.

12:43.953 --> 12:46.254
There's nothing inside the earth
to pump except --

12:46.256 --> 12:49.123
Blood of Unicron.

12:55.797 --> 12:58.533
I awaken.

13:03.910 --> 13:05.210
Okay, hold on.

13:05.212 --> 13:08.547
You mean something's living
down there inside our planet?

13:08.549 --> 13:12.517
I fear that the Earth's very core
is not comprised of magma

13:12.519 --> 13:17.756
as your science has suggested,
but of Dark Energon.

13:17.758 --> 13:21.159
And if we're hearing a Spark,
then Unicron

13:21.161 --> 13:25.297
is the rising darkness
that the prophecy foretold.

13:25.299 --> 13:28.400
So, how do we stop this thing
from rising?

13:28.402 --> 13:32.170
That, I am afraid, was not foretold.

13:32.172 --> 13:36.208
How can something be
in our Earth's core and be alive?

13:36.210 --> 13:39.945
Such a thing
is not unprecedented.

13:39.947 --> 13:42.981
Before the beginning,

13:42.983 --> 13:46.885
there was Primus,
and there was Unicron.

13:46.887 --> 13:50.655
One, the incarnation
of creation...

13:50.657 --> 13:53.558
the other of destruction.

13:56.229 --> 13:59.865
For aeons, Primus and Unicron
battled...

14:01.634 --> 14:03.068
...the balance of power

14:03.070 --> 14:06.538
shifting between them more times
than could be counted.

14:06.540 --> 14:13.545
Only by creating the 13,
the original Primes who preceded me,

14:13.547 --> 14:19.751
was Primus finally able
to defeat Unicron and cast him out.

14:19.753 --> 14:22.287
Primus became one

14:22.289 --> 14:24.423
with the very core of our planet,

14:24.425 --> 14:27.959
creating life through
the well of allsparks,

14:27.961 --> 14:32.497
while Unicron was never
to be heard from again...

14:32.499 --> 14:35.734
until now.

14:35.736 --> 14:38.437
Maybe we can find the hole
this Uber-'Con left

14:38.439 --> 14:40.372
when he dug himself
all the way down there

14:40.374 --> 14:42.441
and fill it full of explosives.

14:42.443 --> 14:47.312
Agent Fowler, I do not believe
that Earth became Unicron's home

14:47.314 --> 14:50.549
but rather that with time
and gravitational force,

14:50.551 --> 14:54.453
debris collected around
the slumbering titan.

14:54.455 --> 14:57.222
Forming your Earth itself.

14:58.791 --> 15:02.194
And he's only awakening now
due to the magnetic pull

15:02.196 --> 15:04.129
created by the planetary alignment.

15:04.131 --> 15:06.565
Okay, well, what happens
now when Unicron

15:06.567 --> 15:08.333
wakes up from his
billion-year nap?

15:08.335 --> 15:12.237
Yeah, does he stretch and kapow!
Earth poufs to dust?

15:15.341 --> 15:17.676
You don't know, do you?

15:17.678 --> 15:20.512
My guess is that Unicron

15:20.514 --> 15:23.315
has transcended physical form
as we know it.

15:23.317 --> 15:25.617
Nonetheless, we must find a way

15:25.619 --> 15:30.422
to ensure that this force of nature
never fully awakens.

15:30.424 --> 15:34.960
The fate of your planet
depends upon it.

15:34.962 --> 15:37.729
Lord Megatron, our cargo hold

15:37.731 --> 15:39.731
is nearly filled
with the dark substance.

15:39.733 --> 15:41.266
I recommend a retreat.

15:41.268 --> 15:44.102
The troops are growing weak
from its effects.

15:44.104 --> 15:46.938
And yet I grow stronger.

15:46.940 --> 15:51.409
Airachnid, you're in command
until my return.

15:53.446 --> 15:55.914
Your return from where, master?

15:55.916 --> 15:59.451
From my audience with Unicron.

16:18.037 --> 16:20.238
I feel your presence!

16:20.240 --> 16:22.274
Share your very spark!

16:22.276 --> 16:26.545
I call on you as my lord
and master, oh, mighty Unicron!

16:38.157 --> 16:40.659
Who would speak to me?

16:40.661 --> 16:42.861
Your servant, most humble.

16:42.863 --> 16:48.066
Megatron, leader of the Decepticons,
and your very herald,

16:48.068 --> 16:50.368
the one who wielded
the Dark Energon

16:50.370 --> 16:53.672
which binds us
to awaken you once again!

16:53.674 --> 16:56.875
The prophecy has been fulfilled!

16:56.877 --> 17:00.745
It is only the beginning
of what we shall accomplish together,

17:00.747 --> 17:03.048
for you shall rule this planet

17:03.050 --> 17:06.184
and those who walk upon it
through me!

17:06.185 --> 17:08.453
Prideful fool!

17:09.855 --> 17:11.790
How dare you think yourself

17:11.791 --> 17:14.659
capable of summoning
my life force?

17:14.661 --> 17:20.265
I rise because I have deemed it
my time!

17:20.267 --> 17:23.602
Master, I did not mean to overstep.

17:23.604 --> 17:25.337
Silence, worm!

17:25.339 --> 17:29.674
I have no need
of your lowly assistance.

17:31.243 --> 17:32.410
Please, my lord!

17:32.412 --> 17:35.080
I exist only to serve you!

17:35.082 --> 17:37.816
What is this I sense?

17:37.818 --> 17:41.620
The taint of Primus?
Here?

17:41.622 --> 17:46.057
That is Optimus, the last of the Primes,
our sworn enemy.

17:46.059 --> 17:48.526
You profess loyalty to me,

17:48.528 --> 17:52.464
yet allow a disciple of Primus to live?!

17:52.466 --> 17:54.299
I will destroy him for you!

17:54.301 --> 17:55.900
His screams will be heard!

17:55.902 --> 17:58.303
I grow weary of your prattle.

17:58.305 --> 18:02.207
Surely if you had the power
to destroy this Prime,

18:02.209 --> 18:04.709
you would have done so already.

18:04.711 --> 18:09.180
I will deal with him myself.

18:25.431 --> 18:27.432
Ratchet, this epicenter

18:27.434 --> 18:29.934
is consistent with the findings
of the others.

18:29.936 --> 18:32.170
<i>Its terrain is rich in ore.</i>

18:32.172 --> 18:33.672
So, what does that tell us?

18:33.674 --> 18:36.975
It follows that the natural
metals in your Earth

18:36.977 --> 18:38.743
would be extensions of Unicron.

18:38.745 --> 18:40.512
His limbs, if you will.

18:40.514 --> 18:42.747
So, he did have
his morning stretch,

18:42.749 --> 18:45.250
which is why these quakes
happened.

18:45.252 --> 18:49.054
Optimus, I'm detecting
a swell in Unicron's spark activity.

18:49.056 --> 18:52.424
Rest assured, Ratchet,
I will proceed with vigilance.

18:55.362 --> 18:59.464
Do you know me,
follower of Primus?

18:59.466 --> 19:02.634
Unicron, the chaos-bringer.

19:02.636 --> 19:04.402
Good.

19:12.311 --> 19:19.451
Now know me as Unicron,
your destroyer!

19:35.101 --> 19:38.670
I humbly request your ear,
lord Unicron.

19:38.672 --> 19:44.109
And what would a Prime
be so compelled to say to me?

19:44.111 --> 19:47.045
I make this appeal
not for myself

19:47.047 --> 19:49.614
but for this planet
which you constitute

19:49.616 --> 19:52.117
and the beings who inhabit it.

19:52.119 --> 19:57.188
Humankind relies upon you
for life, sustenance.

19:57.190 --> 19:58.623
Your resurrection

19:58.625 --> 20:01.960
will only result
in the destruction of a species

20:01.962 --> 20:05.730
which evolved from the seeds
of your very greatness.

20:05.732 --> 20:09.267
So, this humankind
of whom you speak,

20:09.269 --> 20:11.870
you consider them my progeny?

20:11.872 --> 20:13.304
Indeed.

20:13.306 --> 20:15.373
Parasites!

20:15.375 --> 20:18.977
They, too, shall know
my wrathful hand...

20:18.979 --> 20:22.080
once I am finished with you!

20:28.487 --> 20:34.225
The line of Primes has grown
weak in my absence.

20:34.227 --> 20:38.029
And thus, you shall fall.

20:38.031 --> 20:40.131
That outcome is inevitable.

20:40.133 --> 20:42.600
But not on this day!

21:06.992 --> 21:09.327
<i>Yes, disciple of Primus,</i>

21:09.329 --> 21:12.263
<i>on this very day,</i>

21:12.265 --> 21:15.066
<i>for Unicron may be one,</i>

21:15.068 --> 21:19.370
<i>but we all are Unicron!</i>

21:23.984 --> 21:27.776
to be continued...
