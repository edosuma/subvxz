40:35.000 --> 40:36.410
And for the free beer,
which you like.

40:36.420 --> 40:39.617
[ Sighs, chuckles ]
Yeah, for that most of all.

40:39.620 --> 40:41.781
It's...
You know, it's nothing.

40:41.790 --> 40:43.951
No, it's not.
It's...

40:43.960 --> 40:44.870
It's everything.

40:47.120 --> 40:49.748
Ma'am...

40:49.750 --> 40:50.819
Kauffman.

[ Chuckles ]

40:52.170 --> 40:54.070
I, uh,
thought you might be here.

40:54.080 --> 40:56.662
I also thought, uh,
you might want this back.

40:56.670 --> 40:58.376
Oh, wowzer.

40:58.380 --> 40:59.870
You're not gonna get down
on one knee?

40:59.880 --> 41:01.700
[ Chuckles ] Nah.
Come on.

41:01.710 --> 41:02.779
No?
You don't want that.

41:02.790 --> 41:04.781
Thank you.

41:04.790 --> 41:07.418
So, listen, things could have
really gone bad with Nina,

41:07.420 --> 41:12.198
and they didn't 'cause of you,
so...thank you.

41:12.210 --> 41:13.700
Well, I'm gonna take that
as a compliment.

41:13.710 --> 41:15.166
You should.

41:15.170 --> 41:17.661
Um, I may regret
saying this,

41:17.670 --> 41:20.321
but sometimes people
have problems, alright?

41:20.330 --> 41:21.911
And they're
the kind of problems

41:21.920 --> 41:23.205
that police
can't help with.

41:23.210 --> 41:25.451
I got a friend
who's in that kind of jam.

41:25.460 --> 41:26.916
I think
he could use your help.

41:26.920 --> 41:28.990
He'll pay you.

41:29.000 --> 41:30.456
Yeah, cool.

41:30.460 --> 41:34.829
Alright. Look, if you're
interested, give him a call.

41:34.830 --> 41:36.570
Thanks.

41:36.580 --> 41:37.615
Pay your parking tickets,
Dex.

[ Chuckles ]

41:39.250 --> 41:42.071
I don't want to have
to arrest you again.

41:42.080 --> 41:43.991
You kinda want to,
though, a little bit.

41:49.830 --> 41:50.956
What do you think?
Should I call?

41:50.960 --> 41:52.200
No, I don't think
you should call.

41:52.210 --> 41:54.030
You can barely find
your keys half the time.

41:54.040 --> 41:55.200
He said it would pay.

41:55.210 --> 41:56.746
Are you honestly
considering doing this?

41:56.750 --> 41:58.615
I don't know.

41:58.620 --> 42:01.453
Might keep me
out of trouble.

42:01.460 --> 42:04.327
It might.
There he is.

42:04.330 --> 42:07.493
Hey, buddy.
I got your water ready.

42:07.500 --> 42:09.286
Cheers.
Cheers.

42:09.290 --> 42:10.530
Cheers.

42:10.540 --> 42:14.203
Come on and think,
think about you

42:14.210 --> 42:17.748
Come on and think
about the good things
