- Are you okay?

33:46.323 --> 33:48.291
- Yeah, I just have to go
to the bathroom.

33:48.293 --> 33:49.927
- I had to pee
before the drinking.

33:49.994 --> 33:51.528
- Well, you handled it
very well.

33:51.596 --> 33:52.595
- Right? Thank you.

33:52.663 --> 33:53.730
- After three children,

33:53.798 --> 33:55.131
it's a little treacherous.

33:55.199 --> 33:56.466
- I had C-sections.
I don't--I'm sorry.

33:56.534 --> 33:58.102

- I had C-sections, too.

Never been on labor.

- No, it sounds like
a lot of work.

they were like,

"We're gonna have to do
a C-section."

34:04.174 --> 34:05.475

that was implied.

34:09.480 --> 34:11.147
So where'd you go
to do your physical therapy?

34:11.215 --> 34:12.682
- I just went to the gym.

34:12.750 --> 34:14.818
I kinda had a little break--
I had a breakdown.

34:14.820 --> 34:17.354
I, like, cried for an hour.
- Why?

34:17.356 --> 34:19.289
- I called Ryne
and it went horrifically bad.

34:19.357 --> 34:20.623
I just needed
a little validation.

34:20.691 --> 34:21.724
- Yeah, no, I get it.

34:21.792 --> 34:23.226

- Things are lovely.

34:23.228 --> 34:24.193
It's great.

34:24.262 --> 34:25.495
It's not until I have a need.

34:25.563 --> 34:27.163
- It's tough
because your role is this--

34:27.231 --> 34:28.565
- And I don't like to ask
for things.

34:28.633 --> 34:29.633
- Yeah, no, I get it.

34:29.700 --> 34:30.968
- And I don't ask for much.
- Yeah.

34:32.703 --> 34:34.437
- Should I text him
what to say ahead of time?

34:34.439 --> 34:36.974
Like, the note card?
- Just saying,

34:36.976 --> 34:39.242
it's worth a conversation

34:39.244 --> 34:41.444
to define what you need.

34:41.512 --> 34:44.148
- He's like, "You need to find
time for me like you find time

34:44.214 --> 34:46.283
for everything else
that's important in your life."

34:46.350 --> 34:47.318
- He doesn't feel important?

34:48.653 --> 34:50.154
But I'm like, "What do you mean?

34:50.220 --> 34:52.856
I'm doing everything
in my--for you guys."

34:52.858 --> 34:55.058
You know, it's for you.

- Well, Terry--

35:00.465 --> 35:01.798
- I'm seeing patients and--
- Terry says that kind--

35:01.866 --> 35:03.334
He says that to me also.
- Oh.

35:03.400 --> 35:04.868
- I'm on the other side.

35:04.870 --> 35:06.069
Terry and I had

35:06.071 --> 35:07.403
a "Come to Jesus" conversation.

35:07.471 --> 35:11.274
And I said to him, I go,
"Our partnership failed.

35:11.276 --> 35:13.477
Not him, us."

35:13.544 --> 35:15.211
You need to have an agreement--

35:15.279 --> 35:16.180
- Yeah.

35:16.246 --> 35:17.414
- Of who's doing what.

35:17.416 --> 35:18.348
- Yes.

35:18.415 --> 35:19.816
- Right?
- Absolutely, yes.

35:19.818 --> 35:20.817

when it's in front of you,

35:20.885 --> 35:22.418

appreciative of each other.</i>

I want you to be happy.

- Just gonna push that forward.
I don't like octopus.

35:47.778 --> 35:49.512
- No, you don't do octopus?

35:49.580 --> 35:51.781
- Um, no.

Wait, we--

talking about how--

What happened last night?

35:57.455 --> 35:58.588
Why did Emily get up?

35:58.656 --> 36:00.189
- 'Cause Gina told her to.

36:00.191 --> 36:01.591
- But it was Emily that said,

36:01.659 --> 36:02.725
"I'm outta here!"

36:02.793 --> 36:04.161
- Okay, now I'm done.

Good night.
- All right, bye.

36:05.864 --> 36:07.463
- Hey, wait,
where are you going?

36:07.531 --> 36:08.598
- 'Cause you're being offensive.

36:08.666 --> 36:10.400
- She--

36:10.467 --> 36:12.369
- I'm being offensive?
- Both of you.

36:12.436 --> 36:13.536
- I had to--
- I think Gina started it.

36:13.538 --> 36:15.672
- I had to convince Emily
to come back.

36:15.740 --> 36:16.806
- No.
- It was Gina?

36:16.874 --> 36:19.510
- No, it was Gina who was like,
"This is what you do."

36:19.577 --> 36:21.211
"What do you mean, what I do?"
- Wait, wait.

36:21.278 --> 36:22.079
She said that to you?
- Yep.

36:22.146 --> 36:24.547
- "This is what we do"?
- To my face.

36:24.615 --> 36:26.183
It hurt my feelings.

36:26.251 --> 36:27.685
- But you discussed that
with her.

36:27.751 --> 36:28.885
- Yes.

36:28.953 --> 36:30.187
The worst thing is,

36:30.255 --> 36:31.621
with the tag team--
- Oh.

36:31.623 --> 36:33.757
- They justify
each other's behavior,

- What happened yesterday?

36:46.704 --> 36:47.804
- [scoffs]

36:53.444 --> 36:54.844

36:54.912 --> 36:56.579

bring it all up today?"

She said, "I had too much
to drink.

Who needs help here?
We're okay.

are we not understanding?

39:08.046 --> 39:10.980
I put on Amazon,
"LGBTQ+ gifts."

39:10.982 --> 39:13.249
- No, I understand,
but the point is--

39:13.317 --> 39:14.652
- No, you could say,
"I didn't know

39:14.718 --> 39:16.319
that it was offensive."

39:16.321 --> 39:18.321
<i>I don't know
if it was the sweat lodge,</i>

39:18.389 --> 39:21.724
but you're not understanding
the conversation!

39:21.792 --> 39:24.660
Say sorry and say it
like you mean it,

39:24.728 --> 39:26.596
and then maybe it'll be okay.

39:26.663 --> 39:27.930
- Can I say something--
- And now--

39:27.998 --> 39:30.333
- You wanna start
problems with me.

39:30.400 --> 39:32.536
- Can I--can I say something?
Look at me.

39:32.603 --> 39:35.405
Noella, Noella, Noella.

39:35.472 --> 39:37.540
Nobody ----ing listens to me.

39:37.542 --> 39:39.409
You know what?
I'm gonna ----ing yell!

39:39.476 --> 39:40.243
I'm gonna ----ing yell!

39:40.311 --> 39:41.677
- That was loud, Shannon Beador.

39:41.745 --> 39:43.479
- Well, ----ing listen to me!

39:43.547 --> 39:44.747
- Shannon, yeah,
what do you have to say?

39:44.749 --> 39:46.883
- Shannon Beador,
you have the floor.

39:46.885 --> 39:49.552
- I am saying is,

39:49.554 --> 39:51.354
one of these things
was inappropriate.

39:51.422 --> 39:54.090
So you can say to Heather,
"(BLEEP),

39:54.092 --> 39:55.691
I didn't know
about that one thing."

39:55.759 --> 39:56.692
- That's what I'm saying
as well.

39:56.760 --> 39:58.328
- And then it's done.
- I got shoelaces--

39:58.396 --> 40:00.264
- So just say that.
- I got a shirt.

40:00.330 --> 40:01.497
- That's not the point.

40:01.499 --> 40:02.833
- No, listen!

40:02.900 --> 40:05.301
- No, you have
to back down for a minute

40:05.369 --> 40:06.969
and let her explain
her perspective.

40:07.037 --> 40:10.307
- She's saying that--
- Oh, how dare I not know?

40:10.374 --> 40:13.377
That, like,
your straight fragility

40:13.444 --> 40:14.644
when I'm purchasing something--

40:14.711 --> 40:17.714
- My straight fragility?

40:17.716 --> 40:19.515
- Apparently,
that's a thing now.

40:19.583 --> 40:20.984
- I have
a couple of gay children.

40:21.051 --> 40:23.453
Don't tell me that I have
straight fragility.

40:23.520 --> 40:25.855
- I am a bisexual,

40:25.923 --> 40:27.857
biracial, liberal friggin' woman

40:27.859 --> 40:28.858
who lives in Orange County.

40:28.926 --> 40:32.929
Don't you dare tell me
that I'm inappropriate.

40:32.996 --> 40:34.865
- No, no, no, I'm not saying

40:34.932 --> 40:36.867
you are inappropriate.
- Don't you "No, no, no" me!

40:36.934 --> 40:39.068
- I'm saying your gift was.
- [groans]

40:39.136 --> 40:41.871
She's saying that I,
as a bisexual woman

40:41.939 --> 40:44.608
to her bisexual daughter,
that I was inappropriate.

40:44.675 --> 40:46.510
- I'm assuming

40:46.576 --> 40:49.745
you didn't look at the cards.

40:49.813 --> 40:50.947
I'm giving you
the benefit of the doubt.

40:51.014 --> 40:52.649
- You should read them.

40:52.716 --> 40:53.817
- They were in a beautiful
hologram seal--

40:53.884 --> 40:54.885
- All right, you know what?

40:54.952 --> 40:56.819
Whatever, man.
Here are the cards.

40:56.887 --> 40:58.754
"Licking that p---- right."

40:58.822 --> 41:00.823
- Oh, my God!

41:00.891 --> 41:02.591
- "Getting your (BLEEP)."

41:02.660 --> 41:03.960
- Ooh.
- Wait, no, no, I'm not done.

41:04.028 --> 41:07.096
"Having your (BLEEP)
while (BLEEP)."

41:07.164 --> 41:08.665
- Insanely inappropriate.

41:08.732 --> 41:13.703
- "The careless
(BLEEP) credenza."

41:13.771 --> 41:14.904
So I could go on.

41:14.972 --> 41:16.038
But the bottom line is--

41:16.106 --> 41:17.040
- I am horrified.
I am horrified.

41:17.107 --> 41:18.507
- She's got her Jesuit friends

41:18.509 --> 41:19.642
sitting around her.
- I am horrified.

41:19.644 --> 41:20.977
- It's her child.

41:21.044 --> 41:22.611
<i>- If I knew that that's
what the cards said,</i>

41:22.680 --> 41:24.714
<i>I would not have gifted that
to a 17-year-old girl.</i>

41:24.781 --> 41:27.851
But to even use
the word pornography,

41:27.918 --> 41:31.054
it's completely blown
out of proportion.

41:31.121 --> 41:33.457
<i>And it's the wrong word.</i>

41:33.524 --> 41:35.124
- When you buy a gift
for a minor,

41:35.192 --> 41:37.059
you need to know
what's going on.

41:37.127 --> 41:38.761
- I have very,
very young kids, so--

41:38.763 --> 41:39.795
- So you yelling at me

41:39.863 --> 41:40.798
about being bisexual--
- I do, too.

41:40.864 --> 41:42.531
I would do the same thing.
- I have four children

41:42.533 --> 41:45.067
of all different
sexual orientations

41:45.135 --> 41:48.871
that I'm very proud of
and very supportive of.

41:48.939 --> 41:50.407
And it has
nothing to do with that.

41:50.474 --> 41:51.875
So please, I beg of you,

41:51.942 --> 41:55.879
do not try to pull some card
in that space

41:55.946 --> 41:58.481
that I am not understanding

41:58.548 --> 42:00.549
of being bisexual, gay,
anything.

42:00.551 --> 42:02.085
<i>This is what I was worried about</i>

42:02.087 --> 42:03.953
<i>having Noelle on the trip.</i>

42:04.021 --> 42:05.955
She's so calculated that she has

42:05.957 --> 42:08.091
these things in her back pocket

42:08.093 --> 42:09.892
<i>that if she gets into trouble,</i>

42:09.960 --> 42:11.561
<i>that she's gonna say.</i>

42:11.628 --> 42:12.396
You don't win that way.

42:12.462 --> 42:14.531
- The fact that I'm
a bisexual woman

42:14.599 --> 42:17.901
sending your gift--a gift
to your bisexual daughter--

42:17.968 --> 42:19.101
- Is very nice.

42:19.169 --> 42:21.170
But she's still
a 17-year-old child.

42:21.172 --> 42:22.606
And you can't--
- You just--

42:22.672 --> 42:24.173
- Noella, please let me finish.

42:24.241 --> 42:26.043
You just--
It's an inappropriate gift,

42:26.109 --> 42:27.510
which I believe
you didn't understand.

42:27.578 --> 42:28.677
- Would you just--thank you.

42:28.746 --> 42:30.579
- And so, I said--

42:30.581 --> 42:32.048
- Okay, never mind.

42:32.116 --> 42:33.116
- I did not know that,

42:33.183 --> 42:34.618
and I'm sorry.

42:34.684 --> 42:35.651
- Thank you.

42:35.719 --> 42:37.053
Anyway...

42:37.120 --> 42:39.522
- Okay, we're done.

42:39.590 --> 42:41.123
<i>- Next time
on "The Real Housewives</i>

42:41.191 --> 42:42.059
<i>of Orange County"...</i>

42:42.125 --> 42:44.561
- [screams]

42:44.629 --> 42:47.063
- I still have
the six sombreros.

42:47.130 --> 42:48.732
- This was not a good trip
for me.

42:48.799 --> 42:49.933
- If you don't think
that I'm there for you,

42:50.000 --> 42:51.934
it hurts my feelings.

42:52.002 --> 42:54.071
With, like, everything
that happened with Noella,

42:54.137 --> 42:56.705
I can't support somebody
that doesn't trust me.

42:56.774 --> 42:58.575
- You gave your husband a gift

42:58.577 --> 43:00.009
of a stack of vaginas.

43:00.011 --> 43:01.944
- [laughs]
- What's stack of vaginas mean?

43:02.012 --> 43:03.146
Oh, we're stackin'?

43:03.213 --> 43:04.814
- Noella!
- This is what--

43:04.881 --> 43:06.082
But I was on the top!
- You were.

43:06.150 --> 43:07.951
- We still hold some resentment.

43:08.018 --> 43:10.754
I want to be doing something
to make it better.

43:10.821 --> 43:12.089
- Are you willing to do that?

43:12.155 --> 43:13.523
- Yes.

43:13.591 --> 43:14.591
Just want you to be like,

43:14.658 --> 43:15.925
"You did a really good job."

43:15.993 --> 43:17.026
- We'll do this
another time, not--

43:17.094 --> 43:18.595
- Why can't we just--
- I'm gonna go take a break.

43:18.662 --> 43:19.929
This--that's enough.
