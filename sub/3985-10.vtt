00:27.572 --> 00:29.292
You've got
to be shitting me.

00:29.440 --> 00:31.305
Oh, shit!

00:36.478 --> 00:38.035
Get out of the way!

00:42.784 --> 00:44.912
- Driving all crazy.
- Damn.

01:12.842 --> 01:15.429
16. I've got a foot chase
on a number-one male.

01:15.577 --> 01:17.698
Maybe 13 years,
short, with braids,

01:17.846 --> 01:20.168
in the alleys
eastbound from Fulton.

01:20.315 --> 01:22.837
This kid has bailed out!
Bailed out!

01:22.984 --> 01:26.205
Motherfucking fuck fuck
fuck fuck!

01:26.354 --> 01:27.706
Officer, what
are you doing?

01:27.854 --> 01:29.641
What, you need
bifocals or something?

01:29.789 --> 01:32.544
What?

01:32.692 --> 01:34.345
0-9. I'm responding.

01:34.493 --> 01:36.047
16, 200 north.

01:36.195 --> 01:37.949
I'm gonna need your name.

01:38.097 --> 01:40.861
Listen. I'm very sorry,
ma'am, all right?

01:43.000 --> 01:44.524
Give me the hat.

02:14.359 --> 02:16.646
Nah, see, them Expeditions
are hard to handle.

02:16.794 --> 02:19.159
But with a Lexus, man
I wouldn't have no problem.

02:28.438 --> 02:29.925
You little motherfucker.

02:30.073 --> 02:32.836
- You know how many cars you hit?
- What?

02:34.542 --> 02:36.029
Don't even think
of bullshitting.

02:36.177 --> 02:37.803
I don't know what
you're talking about.

02:49.487 --> 02:52.208
You know what kind of fucking
paperwork I got now, huh?

02:52.356 --> 02:55.144
You know how many hours
of my life you owe me, you little shit?

02:55.292 --> 02:57.046
Damn, yo! That hurt!

02:57.195 --> 02:58.815
You think that hurts...

02:58.963 --> 03:00.760
No, no. Aah!

03:03.033 --> 03:04.520
You're so smart,

03:04.668 --> 03:08.068
- see how easy you boost a car now.
- Aah!

04:55.025 --> 04:58.313
You imagine Rawls
sitting in this chair?

04:58.461 --> 05:01.115
Never happen.
In this town? Uh-uh.

05:01.264 --> 05:04.418
Yeah, well, we weren't supposed
to have a white mayor, either.

05:04.565 --> 05:07.553
He already overreached
putting Rawls in charge.

05:07.701 --> 05:09.421
De-fucking-facto.

05:09.570 --> 05:11.124
Motherfucker ain't
even sworn in yet.

05:11.272 --> 05:13.059
Already, he's got
feelers out.

05:13.207 --> 05:16.361
I know for a fact he called
the deputy chief in Pittsburgh--

05:16.509 --> 05:17.429
Friend of mine--

05:17.577 --> 05:20.298
promised him pie in the sky.

05:20.446 --> 05:22.199
Shi-it, partner.

05:22.347 --> 05:25.202
All you got to do is show
Carcetti and everybody else

05:25.349 --> 05:27.470
that they already got
the man for the job.

05:27.618 --> 05:30.172
They ain't got
to look no further.

05:30.321 --> 05:31.740
The indispensable man.

05:31.888 --> 05:34.510
It was Royce
holding you back, Ervin.

05:34.658 --> 05:36.243
Now out from under,
you shine.

05:36.391 --> 05:40.613
Clay, he's saying everything
goes through Bill Rawls.

05:40.762 --> 05:42.648
Any move I try to make--

05:42.797 --> 05:44.418
You're still
the commissioner, ain't you?

05:44.566 --> 05:45.819
You give an order,
they gonna jump.

05:45.967 --> 05:48.422
- Yeah, but Carcetti--
- What he gonna do, fire you?

05:48.570 --> 05:51.300
He just showed you
he don't have balls enough.

05:53.372 --> 05:56.060
You just need to give
Carcetti a little something.

05:56.208 --> 05:59.630
Make him start seeing
you in a new light.

05:59.778 --> 06:01.065
Like what?

06:01.213 --> 06:03.667
Some kind of police shit.
Hell, I don't know.

06:03.815 --> 06:06.469
Something that
looks good to Carcetti,

06:06.617 --> 06:09.403
so he can say it was his idea
to keep you all along.

06:09.551 --> 06:11.106
Hmm.

06:11.253 --> 06:12.440
Police shit?

06:12.588 --> 06:15.443
Well, whatever it is
y'all do for a living.

06:15.591 --> 06:18.246
Well-- just take care
of your end

06:18.393 --> 06:21.328
and let your friends
handle theirs.

06:29.569 --> 06:31.623
Good morning.

06:31.771 --> 06:33.591
I just dropped my stuff
in my room,

06:33.739 --> 06:36.060
and maintenance and Donnelly
are in there checking the heat.

06:36.208 --> 06:38.695
It must be
80 degrees in there.

06:38.843 --> 06:40.697
90-minute classes.

06:40.845 --> 06:42.231
Excuse me?

06:42.379 --> 06:44.999
This time of the year,
we go to 90-minute classes.

06:45.148 --> 06:49.704
Concentrated prep in math
and language arts only.

06:49.853 --> 06:52.408
I don't follow.
Why the heat?

06:52.556 --> 06:56.377
It's the only way the kids will
sit through 90 minutes of anything.

06:56.526 --> 06:59.212
- Make them drowsy?
- Right.

06:59.360 --> 07:00.780
So it's about the tests.

07:00.928 --> 07:05.092
From now until they're done,
everything's about the tests.

07:10.370 --> 07:11.822
Damn!

07:11.970 --> 07:14.291
I ought to go somewhere
warm for the winter.

07:14.439 --> 07:16.191
Where?

07:16.340 --> 07:20.562
I saw on "Animal Planet"
marlin fishing--

07:20.710 --> 07:22.931
Iike, Florida,
the Bahamas.

07:23.080 --> 07:25.434
That shit looked sweet.

07:25.582 --> 07:29.737
The water was like this...
this color, man.

07:29.886 --> 07:32.206
Man, it ain't gonna be
that cold this year.

07:32.353 --> 07:34.975
- How you know?
- Global warming.

07:35.123 --> 07:36.676
So why is it so cold already?

07:36.823 --> 07:39.912
Yo, we just getting old.

07:40.060 --> 07:42.648
Yeah. True that.

07:42.796 --> 07:44.883
Yo. Where the fuck you been?

07:45.031 --> 07:47.453
City jail
for a day and a half

07:47.600 --> 07:48.786
till they recogged me.

07:48.934 --> 07:52.488
Then my grandma got sick,
so I was over there for a while.

07:52.637 --> 07:54.257
Po-Po hit you
with a charge, huh?

07:54.405 --> 07:57.060
Just a humble--
false statement and shit,

07:57.208 --> 07:59.163
for saying I wasn't
who I really was.

07:59.310 --> 08:03.266
Damn, so why they was
asking about you like that?

08:03.414 --> 08:04.367
Hmm-mmm.

08:04.515 --> 08:05.467
They try talking to you?

08:05.614 --> 08:07.468
Yeah, about some murder.

08:07.616 --> 08:09.970
- Which one?
- It don't matter which murder

08:10.117 --> 08:12.540
because I didn't say shit
to them bitches, though.

08:12.688 --> 08:16.088
Yeah, well, I ain't the one
you need to convince.

08:20.360 --> 08:21.579
Why I got to convince him?

08:21.728 --> 08:22.880
You know, I'm saying, yo.

08:23.028 --> 08:25.349
Po-Po come asking about you,
they snatch your ass up,

08:25.496 --> 08:27.350
you out of pocket
for a few days.

08:27.498 --> 08:30.821
Heh! Oh, yeah.
He'll definitely hear about it.

08:30.969 --> 08:32.523
I didn't say nothing
to nobody.

08:32.669 --> 08:34.357
That's why they
gave me the humble,

08:34.505 --> 08:36.460
dumped my ass
in Central Booking,

08:36.607 --> 08:38.626
because I ain't say
a fucking word to none of them.

08:38.775 --> 08:40.462
Yeah, so go tell him
that shit.

08:40.611 --> 08:44.032
Shit, man, if it were me,
I'd go to him first.

08:44.179 --> 08:46.166
Yeah, Kev, you know, definitely
jump out in front of that, man,

08:46.314 --> 08:48.535
because if they got
to come looking for you,

08:48.684 --> 08:50.070
it's gonna look like
you got something to hide.

08:50.218 --> 08:51.972
- Definitely.
- Got that "Plymouth Rock" over here.

08:52.120 --> 08:54.643
Ghetto bird special.
Two for one...

08:55.655 --> 08:57.209
What you want?

08:57.357 --> 08:59.722
- Menu, yo. Give him a menu.
- Oh.

09:02.461 --> 09:05.784
- What's good?
- Fuck if I know.

09:05.931 --> 09:08.219
You ain't supposed to cuss
at the customer, motherfucker.

09:08.367 --> 09:10.788
Kwame. Darnell.

09:10.936 --> 09:12.421
All right.

09:12.570 --> 09:14.923
Let me get... pizza.

09:15.071 --> 09:17.259
Pizza. Anything to drink?

09:17.407 --> 09:18.827
Grape soda.

09:18.975 --> 09:20.795
Quiet, please.

09:20.944 --> 09:23.431
- Is that it?
- Yeah.

09:23.579 --> 09:25.233
Thank you. Say thank you.

09:25.381 --> 09:26.833
Yeah. Thank you.

09:26.981 --> 09:28.368
Menu?

09:28.515 --> 09:30.903
Don't he got to say
"thank you," too?

09:31.051 --> 09:31.971
Darnell.

09:32.118 --> 09:34.105
What the fuck for?
He's supposed to give it back.

09:34.253 --> 09:36.542
Because when you are polite
to people, they treat you better.

09:36.690 --> 09:38.611
- Have a seat, please.
- May I see you?

09:38.759 --> 09:41.454
Now you try being the waiter,
and Albert, be the customer.

09:44.996 --> 09:46.682
What you want to eat?

09:46.831 --> 09:48.284
Give me some crab cakes
and a coke.

09:48.432 --> 09:50.520
Hurry that shit up, too.

09:50.668 --> 09:53.122
Been on the phone
nonstop with Fourth Avenue.

09:53.270 --> 09:55.991
They're insisting every class
teaches to the test.

09:56.139 --> 09:58.158
Oh, God.

09:58.307 --> 10:00.027
Look. I thought
we were the exception.

10:00.175 --> 10:02.128
I mean, that's the point
of the project.

10:02.276 --> 10:05.198
- They know that.
- No exceptions.

10:05.345 --> 10:07.867
And 90-minute blocks of math
or language arts only.

10:08.015 --> 10:09.737
This class?

10:09.884 --> 10:11.771
Kids can't do 30 minutes
without climbing the walls.

10:11.919 --> 10:13.907
Look. Isn't there somebody
we can sit down and talk with,

10:14.055 --> 10:15.607
face to face?

10:15.755 --> 10:17.675
Actually, that's the second thing
they told me.

10:17.823 --> 10:20.444
The area superintendent wants to see
the two of you tomorrow morning,

10:20.592 --> 10:23.526
9:00 in the conference room.

10:28.231 --> 10:31.723
Let's not panic... yet.

10:50.850 --> 10:52.938
Business as usual.

10:53.085 --> 10:54.539
Marlo.

10:54.687 --> 10:56.508
You no know him
when we robbed the game?

10:56.656 --> 10:59.643
He ain't that bad a deuce.

10:59.791 --> 11:01.691
Boy's merely a name to me.

11:05.896 --> 11:07.416
If you knew it was Marlo,

11:07.563 --> 11:09.884
you'd still
go through with it, no?

11:10.033 --> 11:13.559
I wish I'd have known. I'd
have enjoyed it that much more.

11:25.712 --> 11:27.298
Bubs.

11:27.446 --> 11:30.142
It's Herc. You hungry?

11:31.317 --> 11:33.304
Yo, what you done
was fucked up, man.

11:33.452 --> 11:35.572
You don't know how bad
I felt when I heard.

11:35.720 --> 11:37.374
I mean, not only
were you late,

11:37.522 --> 11:40.444
you just rolled right past.
Ain't you see me getting beat?

11:40.591 --> 11:42.278
We rolled by?

11:42.426 --> 11:43.979
I seen you with
the blue light on, man.

11:44.127 --> 11:47.048
Whatever. Look, we had
a communication problem, I admit.

11:47.195 --> 11:48.717
But I'm gonna
get you a phone today,

11:48.866 --> 11:50.553
and that's gonna
solve it for us.

11:50.701 --> 11:52.759
You'll see.

11:54.402 --> 11:55.957
Thing is,
there's this camera--

11:56.105 --> 11:59.659
police department video camera
disappeared a few weeks back.

11:59.807 --> 12:02.661
And for various reasons
that I can't get into,

12:02.809 --> 12:04.463
I got to get it back somehow.

12:04.611 --> 12:05.831
Camera?

12:05.979 --> 12:07.932
Yeah. This fella Marlo
probably took it.

12:08.081 --> 12:09.568
I don't know if he
hocked it or if he--

12:09.715 --> 12:11.769
You're bothering me
about a camera?

12:11.917 --> 12:13.437
You supposed to have
my back, remember?

12:13.585 --> 12:14.504
Five minutes, you told me.

12:14.652 --> 12:16.983
I know. I owe on the deal.

12:19.689 --> 12:21.714
It's Tyrone's, chicken wings.

12:30.033 --> 12:30.918
Here's the thing.

12:31.066 --> 12:32.919
I want you
to put it out there

12:33.067 --> 12:35.788
that there's a $500 bounty
on this camera if it comes back.

12:35.936 --> 12:38.057
No questions asked.

12:38.206 --> 12:39.558
500?

12:39.706 --> 12:42.732
Swear to God. I'm good for it--
if it's the right camera.

12:43.876 --> 12:46.831
Here's the model
and serial number.

12:46.979 --> 12:49.900
So it's 500 for the camera and
a chicken box for Bubs, huh?

12:50.048 --> 12:51.869
It's another 100
to you if this happens.

12:52.016 --> 12:54.103
But I need this camera quick,
or shit's gonna fly.

12:54.251 --> 12:55.638
Look, man,

12:55.786 --> 12:57.540
I told you, it's not about
the money for me right now.

12:57.688 --> 12:59.043
All right?
This motherfucker,

12:59.190 --> 13:00.610
he messing with
my livelihood here.

13:00.758 --> 13:03.246
They're always
coming back, always.

13:03.394 --> 13:05.046
He's like some
"Terminator" and shit.

13:05.195 --> 13:06.614
I'm with you.

13:06.762 --> 13:08.616
I'm gonna do everything I can
to help you out with your problem,

13:08.764 --> 13:10.732
and you're gonna help
me out with mine.

13:22.107 --> 13:24.228
Who the fuck is Randy?

13:24.375 --> 13:26.596
He's a little hopper
from around the way.

13:26.744 --> 13:29.133
He ain't in the game, but he
be with Michael and them.

13:29.281 --> 13:30.767
And he talking to police?

13:30.915 --> 13:32.803
I know it.
I know he did,

13:32.951 --> 13:35.439
because he was the one I told, "Go
tell Lex to go up to the alley.

13:35.587 --> 13:36.840
Patrice is waiting."

13:36.986 --> 13:38.073
You were supposed to do that.

13:38.221 --> 13:39.575
Yeah, I know, but this way,

13:39.722 --> 13:43.180
try to keep some distance
between me and Lex, right?

13:46.528 --> 13:49.049
You tell this Randy
what happened to Lex?

13:49.197 --> 13:51.562
No, I swear it.

13:57.102 --> 13:59.900
Go, motherfucker.
The fuck you still waiting for?

14:06.278 --> 14:09.333
- What the fuck y'all following me for?
- Easy, son.

14:09.480 --> 14:11.812
No. Ain't nobody
walking with me nowhere.

14:33.900 --> 14:35.421
What's up with this Randy?

14:35.569 --> 14:37.489
He can't hurt us.

14:37.638 --> 14:40.592
- He a snitch, though.
- Yeah. Put that around, then.

14:40.741 --> 14:43.061
- Slim.
- Marlo.

14:43.209 --> 14:46.796
- How you feeling?
- Can't complain, yo.

14:46.944 --> 14:49.499
Getting to be
that time, though.

14:49.647 --> 14:51.267
Joe wanted me
to check in, you know?

14:51.415 --> 14:54.747
All right. Pull up
a chair. Let's chop it up.

14:56.619 --> 15:00.039
Now, that there
a Barksdale boy.

15:00.187 --> 15:02.375
So?

15:02.523 --> 15:04.150
Don't add up.

15:06.093 --> 15:07.684
Interesting, though.

15:25.944 --> 15:27.502
Got a burner, see?

15:29.212 --> 15:30.966
If anything else
comes up, you call me.

15:31.114 --> 15:34.635
If this guy robs you again, make sure
he's holding. The more, the better.

15:34.784 --> 15:36.807
Shit, I ain't got
money for all that.

15:45.826 --> 15:46.846
There's 40 minutes on that,

15:46.994 --> 15:48.681
and my number's
in there already.

15:48.829 --> 15:52.059
Watch. I'm gonna call you
today or tomorrow at the latest.

15:57.636 --> 15:59.355
One and one.

15:59.503 --> 16:00.991
Damn, son.
He did a number on you.

16:01.138 --> 16:02.559
Who was it?

16:02.707 --> 16:05.028
Officer Walker.

16:05.176 --> 16:06.801
Walker be evil.

16:08.344 --> 16:10.608
- What up?
- Four.

16:13.114 --> 16:14.668
Yeah, we ought
to fuck him up.

16:14.817 --> 16:17.171
Walker? Yo, he the police.

16:17.319 --> 16:19.006
I'm just saying.

16:19.153 --> 16:20.708
He said next time
I steal a car,

16:20.856 --> 16:22.475
I'm gonna find myself dead.

16:22.624 --> 16:23.742
You gonna do as he say?

16:23.890 --> 16:25.211
Fuck no.

16:25.359 --> 16:26.812
Soon as I get this shit off,

16:26.960 --> 16:29.914
I'll be running his ass
all over town.

16:30.062 --> 16:31.654
Yo, shit!

16:35.301 --> 16:36.753
Told you, Namond.

16:36.901 --> 16:38.455
Gave you fair warning, didn't l?

16:38.603 --> 16:41.857
- I ain't done nothing.
- Get the cash. Got you cold.

16:42.005 --> 16:43.892
Shit, with hair like that, I could
make you from East Baltimore.

16:44.040 --> 16:46.702
- Get the fuck off of me, man.
- Shut up!

16:50.947 --> 16:53.802
- Look what I found.
- That ain't fucking mine!

16:53.950 --> 16:55.436
Hands on the car!

16:55.584 --> 16:57.270
Spread your legs.

16:57.418 --> 16:59.647
- I ain't fucking got--
- Shut up!

17:01.955 --> 17:04.576
How you like it
so far? Having fun?

17:04.723 --> 17:07.546
Guess what?
Gets better.

17:07.694 --> 17:09.320
Give me your hands.

17:13.598 --> 17:15.656
Watch your head.

17:21.104 --> 17:23.592
Damn. Y'all not
wasting any time, huh?

17:23.740 --> 17:25.094
Nerese was
good enough to let us

17:25.242 --> 17:27.561
stage in the council suite
till the inauguration.

17:27.710 --> 17:30.464
No doubt after your fine
showing in the general.

17:30.612 --> 17:32.633
- No doubt.
- 81%?

17:32.781 --> 17:37.169
82. In a city where Democrats
outnumber Republicans nine to one--

17:37.318 --> 17:40.473
Anything less would have
been an embarrassment.

17:40.621 --> 17:42.708
So...

17:42.855 --> 17:46.044
what can we do
for you, Senator?

17:46.191 --> 17:50.246
Well, first of all,
I wanted to clear the air.

17:50.394 --> 17:52.649
If there are any hard feelings
over what happened

17:52.796 --> 17:54.183
during the primary--

17:54.331 --> 17:55.923
You gonna give
the money back?

17:59.969 --> 18:02.325
Senator, it's been
a very long day.

18:02.473 --> 18:05.493
I'll cut to the chase.

18:05.641 --> 18:07.260
I understand
you have a problem

18:07.409 --> 18:09.630
at the top of
the police department.

18:09.778 --> 18:13.066
You asked Burrell
to resign. He declined.

18:13.214 --> 18:14.968
I'm looking
for a replacement.

18:15.116 --> 18:18.437
The ministers like Burrell.
So does the council president.

18:18.585 --> 18:22.440
We're confident that when we
identify a suitable candidate,

18:22.587 --> 18:27.177
Ms. Campbell and the ministers will see
the wisdom of new leadership.

18:27.325 --> 18:31.281
Except y'all need to get a
pay raise through the city council.

18:31.430 --> 18:33.617
Pay raise would help.

18:33.765 --> 18:37.452
I can ask Nerese about
that pay raise getting passed,

18:37.601 --> 18:39.287
maybe convince
some of the ministers

18:39.435 --> 18:42.631
they need to move on
from Burrell.

18:45.474 --> 18:49.342
Situation would have to be resolved
sooner rather than later.

18:50.411 --> 18:52.605
Do my best, partner.

18:53.680 --> 18:55.909
And what do we do
for you in return?

18:57.749 --> 19:00.004
I'm in Annapolis.

19:00.152 --> 19:01.205
Word I'm hearing,

19:01.353 --> 19:03.775
you may be there too,
in a couple of years.

19:03.922 --> 19:08.179
We may find ourselves
working together closely.

19:08.327 --> 19:10.157
Thanks for your time.

19:14.030 --> 19:16.151
Jesus Christ.

19:16.299 --> 19:17.719
He's slick.

19:17.867 --> 19:20.321
Apologizes for the short con,

19:20.469 --> 19:23.424
and then in the next breath
setting us up for the long.

19:23.572 --> 19:25.092
He and Burrell are
as thick as thieves.

19:25.240 --> 19:26.859
And do we know
what the long con is?

19:27.007 --> 19:28.961
At least we know
he's running one.

19:29.109 --> 19:31.634
Shiiiii...

19:39.887 --> 19:41.339
Try calling again.

19:41.487 --> 19:43.773
Man, I know she not
gonna answer.

19:43.921 --> 19:46.242
My moms don't answer
when she go to A.C.

19:46.390 --> 19:48.076
When she coming back?

19:48.225 --> 19:49.679
She going to New York after.

19:49.827 --> 19:52.147
What's she doing in New York?

19:52.295 --> 19:53.815
Shopping.

19:53.963 --> 19:55.624
Going to see some show,
"The Color Purple."

19:57.634 --> 20:01.855
See, now this is where
my job gets good.

20:02.003 --> 20:05.125
You could reach a guardian, we both know
the juvenile master's gonna recog you

20:05.272 --> 20:07.026
on a first-time drug arrest.

20:07.174 --> 20:09.629
But now you'd better have
a toothbrush on you, son,

20:09.776 --> 20:12.075
because it's gonna be
baby booking tonight.

20:19.651 --> 20:21.243
Namond, you scared?

20:23.488 --> 20:25.508
I mean, if it was Cheltenham,
I don't blame you,

20:25.657 --> 20:27.977
but baby booking's
just across town.

20:28.125 --> 20:31.814
The East Side be beefing
with the West Side in there.

20:31.962 --> 20:34.690
There's some dudes
be getting raped and shit.

20:36.064 --> 20:38.032
I mean, that's
what I be hearing.

20:40.334 --> 20:43.056
It's bad in there.
I don't know if it's that bad.

20:43.205 --> 20:45.366
Well, I hear different.

20:52.745 --> 20:55.099
You got no other family?

20:55.247 --> 20:57.234
I got a aunt
down in P.G. County.

20:57.382 --> 20:58.746
You got a number?

21:00.751 --> 21:03.006
Well, I ain't driving you
this late, anyway, so--

21:03.154 --> 21:05.213
Come on, man.

21:14.263 --> 21:16.084
Tell you what:

21:16.232 --> 21:18.418
two of my guys
are working a double,

21:18.567 --> 21:20.454
working midnight shift
tonight.

21:20.603 --> 21:22.955
If you can plant yourself
on that bench over there,

21:23.103 --> 21:24.422
you can stay here
for the night.

21:24.570 --> 21:26.892
But first thing tomorrow,
you got to raise that aunt

21:27.040 --> 21:28.193
or raise your moms,

21:28.341 --> 21:30.400
or I got to process you.

21:35.480 --> 21:37.066
You don't move
off that bench.

21:37.215 --> 21:39.067
You need the bathroom,
you go now.

21:39.215 --> 21:41.404
Otherwise, just...
sit tight,

21:41.551 --> 21:42.971
don't give anybody
any trouble,

21:43.119 --> 21:44.773
or they'll process you
right then and there.

21:44.921 --> 21:47.720
I'm cool. Thanks.

21:50.093 --> 21:52.583
Fucking charity ward here.

21:53.830 --> 21:55.194
I'll go tell
the shift commander.

21:58.499 --> 21:59.988
Yo, Lieutenant...

22:08.040 --> 22:09.293
He a 50?

22:09.441 --> 22:12.629
No. Probably copping
it for my moms.

22:12.777 --> 22:15.498
That's why?

22:15.647 --> 22:18.000
Look. I told y'all,

22:18.148 --> 22:19.767
I just want him gone.

22:19.916 --> 22:22.038
I just want him away
from me and Bug.

22:22.185 --> 22:24.312
The fuck he do to you?

22:31.359 --> 22:33.347
All right.

22:33.495 --> 22:35.189
We'll take care of it, boss.

22:46.370 --> 22:49.125
Another church burglary
in sector two last night.

22:49.273 --> 22:50.293
Madison Park Methodist.

22:50.441 --> 22:52.562
This would be what
you'd call a rash.

22:52.709 --> 22:54.231
And we could use
some ointment.

22:54.379 --> 22:57.500
We need to arrest these fucks.
We getting anywhere on that?

22:57.648 --> 22:59.001
Not yet.

22:59.149 --> 23:00.670
Who caught the last one?
McNulty?

23:00.817 --> 23:03.971
- Working it. We should talk.
- All right.

23:04.119 --> 23:06.874
Speaking of arrests, word from
on high is to sweep corners.

23:07.022 --> 23:09.142
They want arrests to double
over the next month.

23:09.290 --> 23:10.644
How the fuck how?

23:10.792 --> 23:12.145
Jesus, I thought
the election was over.

23:12.293 --> 23:14.280
Bosses want quality-of-life
violations.

23:14.428 --> 23:16.749
What are we talking about,
Lieutenant, loitering?

23:16.898 --> 23:18.449
Disorderlies,
public indecency.

23:18.597 --> 23:19.651
Oh, this is horseshit.

23:19.798 --> 23:21.852
- Broken-windows theory.
- Worked in New York.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.221
Case you ain't noticed,
this ain't New York.

23:23.368 --> 23:24.254
But it could work here.

23:24.402 --> 23:26.155
- Never has.
- Never been done right.

23:26.304 --> 23:28.125
Open containers, too.

23:28.273 --> 23:30.661
- What's wrong with writing a ticket?
- More of that, too.

23:30.809 --> 23:33.630
The word is, the commissioner
himself wants to juke arrests.

23:33.778 --> 23:35.798
Open container used to be
sacrosanct in this town.

23:35.945 --> 23:37.098
Long as it was in a paper bag.

23:37.246 --> 23:38.666
They gave you
that much respect.

23:38.815 --> 23:41.402
Man's beverage
was his business.

23:41.550 --> 23:43.170
You took them
to a restaurant?

23:43.318 --> 23:44.939
Yeah. Ruth Chris.

23:45.087 --> 23:46.540
Linen napkins.

23:46.688 --> 23:48.951
Yeah. Silverware,
more than one fork.

23:51.125 --> 23:52.077
How'd they do?

23:52.225 --> 23:54.245
Eh, pretty well, considering.

23:54.394 --> 23:56.113
Did they embarrass us?

23:56.261 --> 23:59.382
Us? No, uh...
we're fine with it,

23:59.531 --> 24:00.919
but, uh...

24:01.067 --> 24:02.621
I mean, they were
intimidated, embarrassed,

24:02.769 --> 24:04.255
and awkward as hell,

24:04.403 --> 24:06.523
but they made it through.

24:06.671 --> 24:08.390
Ms. Shepherdson,
these aren't the kids

24:08.538 --> 24:10.726
that are gonna be able to sit
still for the statewide tests,

24:10.874 --> 24:11.994
much less do well on them.

24:12.142 --> 24:14.163
These were the kids
that were gonna make it impossible

24:14.311 --> 24:15.331
for anyone else to do well.

24:15.479 --> 24:17.565
So we're writing them off?

24:17.713 --> 24:20.167
No, that's what
we're not doing.

24:20.316 --> 24:22.570
You're not educating them.
You're socializing them.

24:22.718 --> 24:25.171
They weren't being educated before.
There's no point in being obtuse.

24:25.319 --> 24:27.907
- Excuse me?
- Hold on. Hold on.

24:28.055 --> 24:29.474
Look. What he's
saying is this:

24:29.623 --> 24:31.810
I mean, you put a textbook
in front of these kids,

24:31.958 --> 24:33.078
put a problem
on a blackboard,

24:33.227 --> 24:35.147
or teach them every problem
on some statewide test,

24:35.295 --> 24:37.349
it won't matter, none of it,

24:37.497 --> 24:40.485
because they're not learning for
our world, they're learning for theirs.

24:40.633 --> 24:42.819
And they know exactly
what it is they're training for

24:42.967 --> 24:44.487
and what it is everyone
expects them to be.

24:44.635 --> 24:47.023
I expect them to be students.

24:47.170 --> 24:51.093
But it's not about you or us,
or the tests or the system.

24:51.241 --> 24:53.562
It's what they expect
of themselves.

24:53.710 --> 24:56.530
I mean, every single one of them
know they headed back to the corners.

24:56.679 --> 24:59.065
Their brothers and sisters--
shit, their parents--

24:59.213 --> 25:02.068
they came through these same
classrooms, didn't they?

25:02.216 --> 25:03.802
We pretended to teach them,
they pretended to learn,

25:03.951 --> 25:06.038
and where--
where'd they end up?

25:06.186 --> 25:09.142
Same damn corners.

25:09.290 --> 25:11.844
I mean, they're
not fools, these kids.

25:11.992 --> 25:15.145
They don't know our world,
but they know their own.

25:15.294 --> 25:17.582
I mean, Jesus, they--

25:17.729 --> 25:19.663
they see right through us.

25:22.133 --> 25:24.353
I think we made that clear
when you approved the project.

25:24.501 --> 25:26.722
Provisionally approved.

25:26.870 --> 25:28.490
When you provisionally
approved the project,

25:28.638 --> 25:30.358
we made it clear that we
would be addressing children

25:30.506 --> 25:32.493
that required socialization

25:32.641 --> 25:34.061
before they could be
properly educated.

25:34.209 --> 25:36.870
We can't lie.

25:37.878 --> 25:39.368
Not to them.

25:41.383 --> 25:43.145
Captain, line three.

25:47.955 --> 25:49.511
Roll call's over.

25:55.127 --> 25:56.890
You get a line
on your mother yet?

25:58.997 --> 26:01.191
Fucking neglect case
here, I want it.

26:03.067 --> 26:04.556
How about that aunt?

26:07.670 --> 26:10.625
Ain't nobody else you know?
No other responsible adult?

26:10.773 --> 26:11.792
Like who?

26:11.940 --> 26:13.094
I don't know.

26:13.242 --> 26:15.063
I'm just trying to give you
one last shot here

26:15.211 --> 26:16.530
because once I go
on the street today,

26:16.679 --> 26:18.202
you're gonna
have to go to booking.

26:21.614 --> 26:23.169
I got a teacher.

26:23.317 --> 26:24.836
Mr. Colvin.
You know him?

26:24.985 --> 26:26.638
He used to be police.

26:26.786 --> 26:28.440
Tall? Bald?

26:28.588 --> 26:29.986
Yeah.

26:31.690 --> 26:33.318
Yeah, I know him.

26:34.526 --> 26:35.646
What if you
get the one snitch?

26:35.794 --> 26:37.514
The one with the cart.
What's his name?

26:37.662 --> 26:39.047
Bubbles.

26:39.195 --> 26:40.349
Bubbles. Yeah.

26:40.498 --> 26:42.818
You get Bubbles to say
he's Fuzzy Dunlop.

26:42.966 --> 26:45.619
Except Bubbles has been
a registered Cl for years.

26:45.768 --> 26:48.490
Kima gave him a number back
when she was in plainclothes, man.

26:48.637 --> 26:50.558
And, Herc, you worked
with him under that number

26:50.706 --> 26:51.960
on the Barksdale stuff.

26:52.108 --> 26:54.195
So how would you
fuck up the lD?

26:54.343 --> 26:56.563
Fuck me, man.

26:56.711 --> 26:59.765
Look. The only way
to get out from under this

26:59.913 --> 27:02.434
is to stop fucking lying, okay?

27:02.582 --> 27:05.336
You grab your dick,
you walk into Marimow's office,

27:05.485 --> 27:08.172
and you say,
"Lieutenant, I made a mistake.

27:08.320 --> 27:10.742
"l attributed
my PC to an informant

27:10.890 --> 27:12.776
when in fact I had
it off a camera."

27:12.924 --> 27:15.511
That I got from lSD without going
through the proper channels.

27:15.658 --> 27:16.678
No no no.

27:16.827 --> 27:18.713
He's gonna take
my stripes on this.

27:18.861 --> 27:21.817
Maybe he does, but if you wait until lSD
comes looking for that camera

27:21.964 --> 27:24.052
and he figures out
the lie for himself,

27:24.201 --> 27:26.260
he takes your fucking balls.

27:37.678 --> 27:38.765
Come on!

27:38.913 --> 27:40.132
Let's go!

27:40.280 --> 27:41.804
Around the corner.

27:50.054 --> 27:52.044
Got you now, motherfucker.

27:57.227 --> 27:59.181
In going over
some of my paperwork,

27:59.329 --> 28:01.015
it occurs to me
I may have been neglectful.

28:01.163 --> 28:03.618
Look at all this crap!

28:03.766 --> 28:05.987
Every day,

28:06.134 --> 28:09.069
more and more of Lester Freamon's
bullshit washes up with us.

28:13.407 --> 28:14.894
What the fuck are you saying?

28:15.043 --> 28:16.796
That my paperwork
may have been a little sloppy,

28:16.943 --> 28:18.329
and as a result,

28:18.477 --> 28:20.631
I confused myself
on some things.

28:20.779 --> 28:23.300
No shit, you were sloppy.

28:23.448 --> 28:25.836
I actually went back a couple
weeks on your run sheets.

28:25.984 --> 28:28.939
Nothing there references
a meet with a Cl 238.

28:29.087 --> 28:30.506
You went through
all my run sheets?

28:30.655 --> 28:31.986
The best I could.

28:35.124 --> 28:36.011
Sir, listen--

28:36.159 --> 28:38.252
I don't care who it is.
Turn that fucking thing off.

28:41.597 --> 28:44.984
I am starting to believe

28:45.133 --> 28:48.590
that this Fuzzy fella
doesn't exist.

28:50.371 --> 28:51.890
I am starting to believe

28:52.037 --> 28:55.594
that you just followed
Stanfield into the train station

28:55.741 --> 28:59.198
and grabbed the first broad
he brushed up against.

28:59.345 --> 29:02.200
- That what happened?
- No. No, sir.

29:02.348 --> 29:03.733
You lie to me now, Sergeant,

29:03.882 --> 29:05.602
and I guaran-fucking-tee you
I will jam you up,

29:05.750 --> 29:07.238
ship this whole mess to llD

29:07.385 --> 29:09.905
and be there to pass out
sandwiches at your execution.

29:10.053 --> 29:11.340
Yes, sir.

29:11.488 --> 29:14.542
You haven't brought me
a case yet worth talking about,

29:14.690 --> 29:17.979
not on Marlo Stanfield,
not on anyone.

29:18.127 --> 29:22.517
You bring me something
other than llD complaints,

29:22.664 --> 29:25.996
and I might have some reason
to let a few things slide.

29:28.501 --> 29:31.289
Mad at me?

29:31.437 --> 29:32.325
Come on, now.

29:32.473 --> 29:33.825
Dukie's just mad
at everybody.

29:33.974 --> 29:35.527
Ha ha ha!

29:35.675 --> 29:37.302
Snitch bitch.

29:38.544 --> 29:40.663
Yo, what the fuck was that?

29:40.811 --> 29:42.336
I don't know.

29:59.927 --> 30:01.314
I can't believe
y'all are doing this shit.

30:01.461 --> 30:04.050
You're degrading the quality
of life in this neighborhood.

30:04.197 --> 30:05.184
Malt liquor.

30:05.332 --> 30:06.852
Oh, come on, man!

30:07.000 --> 30:08.721
Brother, you got to
shake hands with a pilsner,

30:08.869 --> 30:11.123
maybe a nice tail ale.

30:11.272 --> 30:12.491
Hell, what-- oh, man!
My brew!

30:12.639 --> 30:14.124
My shoes!

30:14.272 --> 30:15.426
God! Man.

30:15.574 --> 30:16.894
What's the violation?

30:17.042 --> 30:19.696
Parking in a bus stop,
expired registration.

30:19.844 --> 30:21.397
First-class
police work, Baker.

30:21.545 --> 30:23.900
Yeah, well, this is
the word from up on high,

30:24.048 --> 30:25.734
straight from the eighth
floor downtown.

30:25.883 --> 30:28.470
Blessed bosses juking stats
for the new administration.

30:28.618 --> 30:29.905
I know you think
it's bullshit,

30:30.054 --> 30:31.839
but I spend my shift
where they tell me.

30:31.986 --> 30:35.008
Baker, let me tell you
a little secret:

30:35.157 --> 30:36.643
A patrolling officer
on his beat

30:36.791 --> 30:39.480
is the one true
dictatorship in America.

30:39.628 --> 30:41.347
We can lock a guy up
on a humble;

30:41.496 --> 30:42.516
we can lock him up for real;

30:42.664 --> 30:44.384
or we can say, fuck it--

30:44.533 --> 30:47.219
pull under the expressway
and drink ourselves to death,

30:47.366 --> 30:49.287
and our side partners
will cover it.

30:49.435 --> 30:54.236
So no one-- and I mean no one--
tells us how to waste our shift.

30:56.541 --> 30:58.428
Pulled the reports
on those church burglaries.

30:58.576 --> 31:02.399
- Yeah?
- Yeah. There's a pattern.

31:02.547 --> 31:04.333
Times and locations.

31:04.480 --> 31:08.235
They're working west by northwest
through Sandtown-Winchester.

31:08.383 --> 31:09.970
The last three--
here, here, and here--

31:10.118 --> 31:11.872
these ones in blue are
the churches they haven't hit

31:12.021 --> 31:13.308
closest to the ones
they have.

31:13.455 --> 31:14.742
You got all this
from the incident reports?

31:14.890 --> 31:16.481
That's why we do
the paperwork.

31:18.193 --> 31:20.379
Giving me a motherfucking
ticket, man?

31:20.527 --> 31:23.015
Are you out of
your motherfucking mind?

31:23.163 --> 31:24.416
I live here, man!

31:24.564 --> 31:26.184
This could get out of hand.

31:26.332 --> 31:27.851
That's what we want,
isn't it? More arrests?

31:27.999 --> 31:29.490
Come on.

31:37.340 --> 31:39.331
No justice, no peace.

31:48.318 --> 31:50.005
It'll only be for tonight.

31:50.153 --> 31:52.087
Mama gets back from
New York tomorrow.

31:54.589 --> 31:56.146
Your call.

32:00.292 --> 32:02.648
The young man seems to
think highly of you, boss.

32:02.796 --> 32:05.183
He invoked your name
with a measure of respect.

32:05.331 --> 32:06.985
It wasn't but
a few weeks ago

32:07.133 --> 32:10.386
I was in a room with him being
called everything but a child of God.

32:10.534 --> 32:13.422
"Mr. Colvin, sir.

32:13.570 --> 32:15.324
Fuck you."

32:15.472 --> 32:17.439
Yeah, well, at least
I said, "Mr."

32:23.146 --> 32:24.866
So what was the charge?

32:25.014 --> 32:26.368
Slinging.

32:26.516 --> 32:28.267
He'd been out there
a few weeks or so.

32:28.416 --> 32:32.005
First pop,
second warning from me.

32:32.153 --> 32:34.941
Maybe you should put him
on the juvenile bus.

32:35.089 --> 32:37.010
He wants so bad
to be a gangster,

32:37.158 --> 32:39.645
maybe it's time he get a taste of what
a real lockup's all about, you know?

32:39.794 --> 32:41.947
Come on, Mr. C.,
don't do me like that.

32:42.095 --> 32:44.748
I made him sleep on
the DEU bench last night,

32:44.896 --> 32:47.651
if that counts for anything.

32:47.799 --> 32:49.219
Isn't there anybody else?

32:49.367 --> 32:51.053
Friend, relative, anybody?

32:51.202 --> 32:53.364
You've always been good
with the knuckleheads, boss.

33:00.609 --> 33:03.406
Ahh. All right.
Let me go call my wife.

33:23.895 --> 33:25.954
Yeah. Go up
in that building.

33:35.471 --> 33:37.725
Mmm, man,
that was delicious.

33:37.873 --> 33:39.294
There's more.

33:39.441 --> 33:41.162
Uh, no, ma'am.
Saving room for the cobbler.

33:41.310 --> 33:42.929
A la mode?

33:43.077 --> 33:44.498
Huh?

33:44.646 --> 33:46.066
Would you like
ice cream on it?

33:46.214 --> 33:49.268
Oh! Oh, yes, ma'am.

33:49.417 --> 33:51.235
Nice manners.

33:51.383 --> 33:53.504
From what you told me
on the phone, Bunny,

33:53.653 --> 33:56.586
I was expecting
more of an adventure.

34:04.063 --> 34:05.482
Bunny?

34:05.630 --> 34:07.583
Only my friends
call me Bunny.

34:07.731 --> 34:12.321
- Yeah, but why?
- You don't need to know.

34:12.469 --> 34:16.199
And if you tell anybody,
I'll cut your balls off.

34:19.609 --> 34:21.661
I'll cut them off, give 'em
to Donnelly in a jar.

34:21.810 --> 34:24.004
Don't doubt me, boy.

34:30.516 --> 34:31.870
You ain't got no kids?

34:32.018 --> 34:35.715
Grown. They're at
college and past that.

34:41.225 --> 34:44.013
You told me
these kids were rough.

34:44.161 --> 34:48.217
Thank you, sweetie.
But don't be fooled.

34:48.364 --> 34:51.954
This is his
Eddie Haskell act.

34:52.101 --> 34:54.422
Eddie Haskell?
Who that?

34:54.570 --> 34:58.164
You are, son. Trust me.

35:00.341 --> 35:02.240
Take a seat.

35:03.644 --> 35:04.964
Put yours against
the wall with the others.

35:05.112 --> 35:06.966
Welcome wagon's on
their way back from booking.

35:07.114 --> 35:09.001
- We need the key to the interview room.
- What the fuck for?

35:09.149 --> 35:10.636
Felony burglary.

35:10.784 --> 35:12.182
Felony?

35:14.486 --> 35:16.173
Caught them coming
out of St. Martin's on Fulton.

35:16.321 --> 35:17.741
Charging them with the one,

35:17.889 --> 35:19.843
but we might work back
on a few more.

35:19.991 --> 35:21.577
No shit?

35:21.725 --> 35:24.353
Fucking knew there was still
some real criminals left in Baltimore.

35:26.763 --> 35:29.617
Swear to God, I'm seeing
citations for jaywalking.

35:29.765 --> 35:31.985
We're locking people up
for open container,

35:32.133 --> 35:34.555
for disorderly,
for loitering.

35:34.702 --> 35:35.722
The neighborhood people,

35:35.870 --> 35:38.125
sometimes they appreciate
quality-of-life arrests.

35:38.272 --> 35:40.193
Except we're locking up
the neighborhood people.

35:40.341 --> 35:42.962
Some of my guys,
all they see are the stats.

35:43.110 --> 35:44.798
I mean, the election's
fucking over, right?

35:44.946 --> 35:46.364
Who are we doing this for?

35:46.512 --> 35:49.534
Is this coming
from Burrell or Rawls?

35:49.682 --> 35:51.169
We got it from
the chief of patrol.

35:51.317 --> 35:53.404
It's rolling
downhill, for sure.

35:53.551 --> 35:54.471
Morale?

35:54.619 --> 35:55.806
Split down
the middle, I'd say.

35:55.954 --> 35:57.874
The officers that love
the stat are jazzed.

35:58.021 --> 35:59.975
The rest of them?

36:00.123 --> 36:01.344
We don't know where to turn.

36:01.492 --> 36:04.245
I thought a new hump as mayor
might change this shit,

36:04.393 --> 36:05.883
not ramp it up.

36:07.395 --> 36:08.949
Hey, you still
fucking that bitch?

36:09.097 --> 36:10.724
Yeah. It burning
like hell, man.

36:12.201 --> 36:14.655
When you gonna burn
the bitch back? Oh, check it.

36:14.804 --> 36:16.490
Slim.

36:16.638 --> 36:17.891
B. What up?

36:18.039 --> 36:19.393
All right.

36:19.540 --> 36:20.926
- Poot.
- It's good.

36:21.075 --> 36:23.395
- Heard you're out.
- Yeah.

36:23.543 --> 36:25.697
- Welcome home.
- Thanks, dawg.

36:25.845 --> 36:28.633
And you with Prop Joe now.

36:28.780 --> 36:30.467
Never would have thought.

36:30.615 --> 36:32.670
Yeah, well, life's strange.

36:32.818 --> 36:36.445
Yeah. Holler.

36:37.621 --> 36:40.145
Bodie... how you and Marlo?

36:41.992 --> 36:43.978
You okay with him?

36:44.126 --> 36:47.216
As far as I know, yeah. Why?

36:47.364 --> 36:49.318
What he did to your boy.

36:49.465 --> 36:50.852
What boy are you talking?

36:51.000 --> 36:52.253
Big boy,

36:52.401 --> 36:54.454
the one rub his hands
together all the time?

36:54.602 --> 36:57.289
Kevin? What about him?

36:57.438 --> 36:58.791
You ain't heard?

36:58.939 --> 37:02.193
Chris and Snoop walked
him down an alley.

37:02.341 --> 37:05.396
He in a vacant now.

37:05.544 --> 37:06.931
How you know that?

37:07.079 --> 37:09.398
I seen them lay
hands on the boy.

37:09.546 --> 37:11.673
And now the word out
on the street.

37:15.219 --> 37:16.617
Sorry, dawg.

37:21.291 --> 37:22.814
Let's roll.

37:31.198 --> 37:34.292
Plymouth Rock.
Got that Plymouth Rock.

37:40.773 --> 37:42.227
All right.

37:42.375 --> 37:45.495
But now look at the next
example question on page 20.

37:45.643 --> 37:47.235
As you can see...

37:48.812 --> 37:51.635
if you turn to page 20,
they will sometimes ask you

37:51.783 --> 37:54.838
for words that are the opposite
of words that are underlined.

37:54.986 --> 37:57.072
Uh, thank you,
Mr. Pryzbylewski.

37:57.220 --> 37:59.120
Thank you.

38:02.825 --> 38:04.711
All right, put away
your test notebooks.

38:04.860 --> 38:06.417
Work on those tomorrow.

38:08.929 --> 38:10.750
We have, uh,
45 minutes left.

38:10.898 --> 38:12.485
We can do
"Last of the Mohicans"--

38:12.633 --> 38:14.253
- No!
- No!

38:14.401 --> 38:15.819
Or practice probabilities.

38:15.967 --> 38:17.422
- Yeah.
- Yes.

38:17.570 --> 38:20.291
- I'll get the stuff, Mr. Prezbo.
- All right.

38:20.439 --> 38:22.927
And I want to see
everybody's worksheets out.

38:23.074 --> 38:24.995
Hey, Kareem, you want
to play dice with me?

38:25.143 --> 38:27.630
Not with you.

38:27.779 --> 38:30.533
And we're not just
playing games here.

38:30.681 --> 38:32.101
We're doing math.

38:32.249 --> 38:34.002
I'll roll with you, man.
Come on.

38:34.150 --> 38:36.811
No kidding.
We are.

39:03.741 --> 39:06.209
That's my boy
resting his head, see?

39:10.747 --> 39:12.834
Mmm.

39:12.982 --> 39:15.136
Hey, Renaldo,
you want one?

39:15.283 --> 39:16.538
No.

39:16.686 --> 39:19.473
They're from Faidley's, yo.

39:19.622 --> 39:21.075
He might stay home
all day, you know?

39:21.223 --> 39:23.156
We gonna find out, ain't we?

39:30.063 --> 39:33.051
- Like to see about my DSS code.
- Do you have an appointment?

39:33.200 --> 39:34.152
Why I need an appointment?

39:34.300 --> 39:35.954
Zenobia, I don't think
she needs an appointment.

39:36.101 --> 39:37.788
Sorry, just trying
to make it realistic.

39:37.936 --> 39:39.189
So I get to see somebody?

39:39.337 --> 39:40.790
You're gonna have to
take a number and wait.

39:40.938 --> 39:42.592
I need to see
somebody right now.

39:42.740 --> 39:45.227
Don't get angry. Anger doesn't help.
It just makes people defensive.

39:45.375 --> 39:47.129
Tell her what you need calmly.

39:47.277 --> 39:50.032
- Card didn't come this month.
- We mailed it.

39:50.180 --> 39:52.834
- Maybe it got stolen.
- Heh. Sorry. Nothing we can do.

39:52.983 --> 39:54.836
- Fuck you.
- Chandra!

39:54.984 --> 39:56.769
- She ain't helping me.
- That's how they do.

39:56.917 --> 39:58.537
Just tell her what you need.

39:58.685 --> 40:00.506
- Need another card, bitch.
- Chandra.

40:00.654 --> 40:02.675
And that's reality.

40:02.823 --> 40:04.711
Fuck you for real.

40:04.858 --> 40:07.613
- Oh!
- Oh!

40:07.761 --> 40:09.248
Calm down.
Calm down.

40:09.395 --> 40:11.182
Go with Ms. Mason.

40:11.330 --> 40:14.018
- Get your hands off!
- Ms. Mason!

40:14.166 --> 40:16.157
I'll get the school police.

40:17.903 --> 40:19.255
She was like...

40:19.403 --> 40:21.090
And then-- and then--
and then she was like...

40:21.238 --> 40:22.625
Typical day?

40:22.773 --> 40:25.827
I wouldn't know.
My first time.

40:25.975 --> 40:27.929
Your first time?

40:28.077 --> 40:30.168
Mrs. Donnelly
oversees this project.

40:31.747 --> 40:33.408
Okay.

40:46.525 --> 40:48.713
Good morning, ladies.

40:48.861 --> 40:51.261
Help a man get
something to eat?

40:52.830 --> 40:55.128
God bless.

41:00.637 --> 41:02.228
Good morning, Reverend.

41:12.281 --> 41:13.834
Yo.

41:13.983 --> 41:15.102
Glad you finally answered.

41:15.250 --> 41:16.570
Yeah, I was in
a meeting yesterday.

41:16.718 --> 41:18.072
You got the asshole
pinned down?

41:18.220 --> 41:20.605
Nah, I got Marlo's people--
getting ready to make a drop.

41:20.753 --> 41:22.507
- Where?
- Edmondson, near Pulaski.

41:22.655 --> 41:24.075
You eyeballing
them right now?

41:24.223 --> 41:25.710
Yeah, he got the package.

41:25.857 --> 41:27.646
Black bag, putting it
in the trunk.

41:27.793 --> 41:29.914
- He getting in right now.
- What make?

41:30.062 --> 41:33.050
Late model Lincoln.
You want the license?

41:33.197 --> 41:38.156
- Yeah, give it.
- P-R-8-Z-G-O-D.

41:39.936 --> 41:42.156
Yeah. Yeah, he pulling out now,
turning down Gilmore.

41:42.304 --> 41:43.759
Dozerman,
get me Foxtrot.

41:43.906 --> 41:45.602
Good job, Bubs.
We're on it.

41:47.244 --> 41:50.465
Ladies, a cell phone?
It's got, like, a half hour on it.

41:50.613 --> 41:52.512
No thank you.

42:06.325 --> 42:07.611
What I saw today

42:07.759 --> 42:10.346
wasn't education
as I understand the term,

42:10.494 --> 42:14.150
and they didn't seem
very socialized, either.

42:14.298 --> 42:15.917
You didn't catch us
on our best day.

42:16.065 --> 42:17.553
Or your worst day?

42:17.701 --> 42:20.021
On the whole, they've
actually made a lot of progress.

42:20.169 --> 42:21.890
Look, I mean,
they come to class,

42:22.038 --> 42:23.525
they're more engaged.
We're reaching them.

42:23.673 --> 42:25.458
Fewer outbursts,
no suspensions.

42:25.607 --> 42:27.994
But are they really
learning anything?

42:28.142 --> 42:29.829
Yes. We believe they are.

42:29.977 --> 42:31.331
Be truthful.

42:31.479 --> 42:34.466
If this program
were to continue

42:34.614 --> 42:36.401
through the rest
of the school year,

42:36.549 --> 42:39.171
how many of your students
could realistically

42:39.319 --> 42:42.185
be expected to return
to a regular classroom?

42:43.688 --> 42:46.142
What do you think,
Ms. Duquette?

42:46.291 --> 42:49.044
Namond, Darnell,
maybe Zenobia.

42:49.192 --> 42:52.082
Yeah, look. I mean,
considering where we started

42:52.230 --> 42:53.382
and considering
that those kids

42:53.530 --> 42:54.818
ain't out there
tearing up other classes--

42:54.966 --> 42:57.520
Okay. Mrs. Donnelly.

42:57.668 --> 42:59.520
A tremendous achievement.

42:59.668 --> 43:03.160
Mr. Withers?

43:04.506 --> 43:06.531
I'll go along
with Mrs. Donnelly.

43:08.376 --> 43:10.163
You haven't said anything yet.

43:10.312 --> 43:12.498
I just don't see it.

43:12.646 --> 43:15.099
Many of these kids
are profoundly damaged--

43:15.247 --> 43:18.369
what they've seen,
how they've lived.

43:18.517 --> 43:22.405
And I think any gain
or progress is temporary.

43:22.553 --> 43:25.387
I think this project
may be flawed.

43:26.992 --> 43:28.845
Foxtrot 23-30.

43:28.994 --> 43:30.413
We have a visual
on the suspect.

43:30.561 --> 43:32.648
Vehicle headed east
on Mulberry. Do you copy?

43:32.796 --> 43:36.561
- 10-4. We're almost there.
- 10-4.

43:41.470 --> 43:43.491
After your phone call,
I checked.

43:43.639 --> 43:45.525
It came directly from Burrell.

43:45.673 --> 43:48.359
He bypassed Rawls after l
specifically told him he was--

43:48.507 --> 43:52.230
Burrell's making a play
for you to keep him.

43:52.378 --> 43:55.333
By, uh, just--
what did you call that?

43:55.480 --> 43:57.036
Juking the stats.

43:57.183 --> 43:58.403
Guy is unbelievable.

43:58.551 --> 44:01.306
It runs completely counter to
all my discussions with Rawls,

44:01.454 --> 44:03.540
with you, with everyone.

44:03.688 --> 44:05.174
He's also serving notice.

44:05.322 --> 44:07.142
He's reasserting control
of the department.

44:07.291 --> 44:10.078
He probably figures if you can't
fire him, then you can't fire him.

44:10.226 --> 44:12.614
And does Rawls know?

44:12.762 --> 44:14.381
My guess is, Rawls
heard about it days ago

44:14.529 --> 44:16.116
from half a dozen
district commanders.

44:16.264 --> 44:18.052
Why wouldn't
he come to me?

44:18.200 --> 44:20.821
Talk to him.

44:20.969 --> 44:22.055
Why did you come to me?

44:22.203 --> 44:24.432
I mean, why not go to Rawls?

44:27.005 --> 44:29.928
Because I need to know
if you're serious.

44:30.076 --> 44:32.497
If Rawls already came to you
and this shit is still going on,

44:32.645 --> 44:35.500
then you're okay with it,
which is for me a problem.

44:35.648 --> 44:36.968
If he didn't come to you,

44:37.116 --> 44:38.935
then either he's okay with it,
which is also a problem,

44:39.083 --> 44:40.904
or he's letting it go,
trying give Burrell enough rope

44:41.052 --> 44:44.173
for you to get angry and
fire the man for insubordination.

44:44.321 --> 44:47.209
But I need to know
where you stand.

44:47.357 --> 44:48.978
Well, I gave you my word.

44:49.126 --> 44:52.458
Yes. You did.

44:54.196 --> 44:56.992
Well, thanks for going outside
the chain of command.

44:59.933 --> 45:02.196
Don't expect me
to make a habit of it.

45:15.847 --> 45:17.268
Stay in the car!

45:17.415 --> 45:20.407
Stay in the car.
Keep your hands on the wheel.

45:23.052 --> 45:25.040
- Let's see those hands.
- What's the problem, Officer?

45:25.189 --> 45:27.713
Step slowly out of the vehicle.
Keep your hands up.

45:40.968 --> 45:42.155
Son, be gentler than that.

45:42.303 --> 45:44.100
Shut the fuck up.
I ain't your son.

45:47.406 --> 45:48.997
This guy...

46:04.486 --> 46:06.954
What's this, huh?
What's this?

46:19.833 --> 46:25.031
Do you know what? I'm gonna damn
sure get your name and badge number.

46:32.811 --> 46:35.364
Daniels. I don't
think I know him.

46:35.512 --> 46:37.333
Oh, he hasn't
played much politics,

46:37.480 --> 46:40.668
though he used to be married to
the new councilwoman in the 11th.

46:40.816 --> 46:43.605
- Marla Daniels?
- Mm-hmm. That's the one.

46:43.753 --> 46:47.775
This is the last man we want
as police commissioner, Nerese.

46:47.923 --> 46:51.010
I mean, I squared off against
this fellow a few years back,

46:51.158 --> 46:52.912
and he wouldn't
listen to me.

46:53.060 --> 46:55.281
He's not gonna listen
to you or the ministers

46:55.429 --> 46:56.916
or anyone else
in the community.

46:57.064 --> 46:58.616
- Just Carcetti?
- Mm-hmm.

46:58.765 --> 47:00.985
Oh, he's the mayor's boy,
definitely.

47:01.133 --> 47:03.455
Carcetti is looking
for how much of a salary bump?

47:03.602 --> 47:04.956
50,000, at least,

47:05.104 --> 47:07.523
to make the position
competitive nationally.

47:07.671 --> 47:09.726
Give him 25.

47:09.874 --> 47:12.060
It'll be enough to make him
think he'll win you over eventually

47:12.209 --> 47:14.796
but less than he needs
to entice anyone real.

47:14.944 --> 47:17.967
Meanwhile, Carcetti's gonna
have to give Daniels

47:18.114 --> 47:20.570
six months in ClD
before he can bump him again,

47:20.717 --> 47:22.137
for appearance's sake.

47:22.285 --> 47:24.271
So we're buying time here.

47:24.418 --> 47:26.639
Enough for Ervin to show the
new mayor who butters the bread.

47:26.788 --> 47:31.044
And for events to take the
new-penny shine off Cedric Daniels.

47:31.192 --> 47:35.094
I happen to know he's less
the saint than he pretends to be.

47:44.134 --> 47:47.831
This is Senator Davis.
Is the Mayor in at the moment?

47:49.674 --> 47:53.262
Well...you just tell him
his friend Clay

47:53.410 --> 47:58.565
got the council president to un-ass a
salary bump for the police commissioner.

47:58.713 --> 48:00.934
You tell him...

48:01.083 --> 48:02.803
write this down, now.

48:02.951 --> 48:08.513
You tell him that Senator Davis
has his interests at heart.

48:10.391 --> 48:13.345
Right.

48:13.494 --> 48:16.552
Thanks.

48:29.141 --> 48:31.607
Hey, Ma. How was New York?

48:33.543 --> 48:35.930
Hey, Ms. Brice.
How are you?

48:36.078 --> 48:37.632
Who asking?

48:37.780 --> 48:41.034
This is my teacher, Mom--
Mr. Colvin.

48:41.182 --> 48:44.503
Why he here?
You in trouble?

48:44.652 --> 48:45.939
He stayed at our house
last night,

48:46.087 --> 48:48.110
with you being
in New York and all.

48:50.122 --> 48:53.477
Tell her.

48:53.625 --> 48:56.148
The cops picked me up,
saying I was slinging.

48:56.295 --> 48:58.949
They was gonna send me
to baby booking.

48:59.097 --> 49:01.588
But we took him in.

49:04.134 --> 49:07.790
You leave my son
the fuck alone.

49:07.937 --> 49:11.559
And you, you afraid
to go to baby booking?

49:11.708 --> 49:15.438
The fuck is wrong with you, boy?
Get in the damn house!

49:30.790 --> 49:32.578
Kid got the point.

49:32.726 --> 49:34.780
all these drunk and disorderlies
and squeegee boys,

49:34.927 --> 49:36.548
graffiti artists,
and public urinators,

49:36.695 --> 49:39.649
and here we come in with
a pair of felony burglaries.

49:39.797 --> 49:41.718
Nice of you to give him
the collar.

49:41.866 --> 49:43.719
Well, he might turn out
a decent police.

49:43.868 --> 49:46.222
Got to come from somewhere.
Young generation.

49:46.370 --> 49:48.690
- Uh-huh.
- What about you guys?

49:48.838 --> 49:50.825
You gonna follow
in your dad's footsteps?

49:50.973 --> 49:52.993
Hello, I don't think so.

49:53.142 --> 49:54.894
- Not.
- What, then?

49:55.042 --> 49:57.730
- Video game designer.
- Rock star.

49:57.878 --> 50:00.099
- Ahh.
- Ah, they want to make money.

50:00.246 --> 50:03.469
- You schooled them well.
- How about you, Little Bunk?

50:03.618 --> 50:05.238
You'll be a detective
like your daddy?

50:05.386 --> 50:07.472
- Chief of police.
- Nah.

50:07.620 --> 50:10.708
Why not? How about you?

50:10.857 --> 50:15.293
Oh, he's still in that, you know,
pediatric neurosurgeon stage.

50:17.561 --> 50:18.815
- Hi.
- Hey.

50:18.963 --> 50:21.551
Hey! Elena,
how are you doing?

50:21.699 --> 50:23.151
I'm good.
How are you?

50:23.300 --> 50:24.653
Can't complain.

50:24.801 --> 50:27.054
Hey, boys.
How are you?

50:27.201 --> 50:29.923
Can you say hi?

50:30.071 --> 50:33.159
Listen. They're fine.
They really do have manners.

50:33.307 --> 50:34.861
It's all right.
My kids are the same way.

50:35.009 --> 50:37.197
We're just finishing up.
Please sit down.

50:37.345 --> 50:41.501
Oh-- okay.
Just for a minute.

50:41.648 --> 50:43.369
Dad, five bucks
for the jukebox?

50:43.516 --> 50:46.542
What? What happened to
three plays for a quarter?

50:48.086 --> 50:50.841
Um... homework?

50:50.989 --> 50:53.911
- Done, Dad helped us.
- Oh.

50:54.059 --> 50:56.219
I got off early. Here.

50:57.261 --> 50:59.682
You want to go, too?

50:59.830 --> 51:01.983
So what are you drinking?

51:02.131 --> 51:04.184
I'll have a white wine.

51:04.332 --> 51:05.452
Mmm?

51:05.600 --> 51:07.295
I'm good, thanks.

51:18.845 --> 51:21.967
So it's true?
You quit drinking?

51:22.114 --> 51:25.303
Well, I have a beer
now and again.

51:25.451 --> 51:27.146
No big deal.

51:32.123 --> 51:35.244
How's Dennis?

51:35.392 --> 51:38.947
Dennis is... Dennis.

51:39.096 --> 51:41.382
We're close, we're not.

51:41.530 --> 51:43.556
You know, we'll see.

51:44.667 --> 51:47.568
- How's Beadie?
- We're good.

51:48.637 --> 51:50.089
The kids have my number, but...

51:50.237 --> 51:51.637
Mmm.

51:55.641 --> 51:57.195
Wow.

51:57.343 --> 52:00.676
If I had known you were gonna
grow up to be a grownup...

52:04.317 --> 52:06.370
Pssh, man.

52:06.518 --> 52:08.103
And I'm the one that told
him to do the right thing

52:08.252 --> 52:10.806
and go talk to the man.

52:10.954 --> 52:13.675
It don't seem
that way now, do it?

52:13.823 --> 52:17.079
I mean, yo, you got to look at
it from Marlo's point of view.

52:17.227 --> 52:18.447
I mean, how this
different from Wallace?

52:18.596 --> 52:20.782
Because Stringer said
Wallace snitched.

52:20.930 --> 52:23.550
Yo. Kevin might have
snitched too.

52:23.698 --> 52:27.187
- Man, but he didn't.
- And we had to do Wallace!

52:27.335 --> 52:28.821
Yo, Marlo thought
he had to do Kevin.

52:28.970 --> 52:31.657
- Man.
- But he didn't.

52:31.805 --> 52:33.466
That's what I'm saying.

52:35.375 --> 52:36.729
He's a cold motherfucker.

52:36.876 --> 52:39.664
It's a cold world, Bodie.

52:39.811 --> 52:41.665
Thought you said
it was getting warmer, nigger.

52:41.813 --> 52:46.476
World going one way,
people another, yo.

52:49.087 --> 52:51.507
Now, Elton Brand--
what you know about him?

52:51.655 --> 52:53.877
Nothing. You see?

52:54.024 --> 52:56.644
Bug, you seen your daddy?

52:56.792 --> 52:58.953
Went to the store.

53:01.463 --> 53:03.584
Where you going?

53:03.732 --> 53:05.251
I'm gonna look for him.

53:05.400 --> 53:06.753
You ain't gonna find him.

53:06.901 --> 53:09.922
Why not?

53:10.070 --> 53:11.833
Because he ain't coming back.

53:32.655 --> 53:34.145
Thanks.

54:15.357 --> 54:18.512
- What's this about?
- Like you don't know.

54:18.659 --> 54:21.491
Man, I ain't been home long enough
to get in somebody's shit.

54:23.763 --> 54:26.184
You like boys,
motherfucker?

54:26.333 --> 54:27.319
What?

54:27.467 --> 54:30.388
Boys. You like
fucking them?

54:30.537 --> 54:33.024
Man, I like pussy.
All right? Booty.

54:33.172 --> 54:34.799
Living with
a woman now.

54:36.008 --> 54:37.560
She got kids?

54:37.709 --> 54:40.336
I ain't touch them kids!
Who told you that?

54:42.212 --> 54:43.865
I know what
you're saying,

54:44.014 --> 54:47.040
but when you're on the inside,
ain't no pussy.

54:48.285 --> 54:51.840
Well, yeah, shit.
You've been inside.

54:51.987 --> 54:54.107
Man got to bust his nut,
know what I'm saying?

54:54.255 --> 54:55.654
I do.

55:49.468 --> 55:50.754
Damn.

55:50.902 --> 55:53.735
You didn't even wait to get
the motherfucker in the house.

55:54.305 --> 56:00.213
