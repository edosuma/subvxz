00:16.767 --> 00:19.520
You are behind schedule, Alpha Sentinel.

00:19.603 --> 00:20.687
Unacceptable.

00:20.771 --> 00:23.440
I need this replicator working before...

00:23.523 --> 00:24.358
<i>Megabyte.</i>

00:24.441 --> 00:25.441
...that.

00:25.901 --> 00:27.444
<i>I want a progress report.</i>

00:27.528 --> 00:29.112
Rest assured, Sourcerer,

00:29.196 --> 00:33.283
preparations to expand my sentinel army
are well underway.

00:33.367 --> 00:34.493
Preparations?

00:34.576 --> 00:37.788
I don't care about preparations.
I want results.

00:37.871 --> 00:40.249
As do I, of course.

00:40.332 --> 00:44.336
But such an undertaking
requires proper execution.

00:44.419 --> 00:47.631
<i>Just do it. Get it done.</i>

00:47.714 --> 00:51.343
I need more firepower for
my next hack, understood?

00:51.426 --> 00:53.428
You could not be more clear.

00:53.512 --> 00:56.974
I will provide you with
an impressive show of force.

00:57.349 --> 00:59.184
You have my word.

00:59.726 --> 01:02.104
Words are worthless.

01:02.396 --> 01:03.396
Useless.

01:03.438 --> 01:06.358
<i>Your actions will prove your value.</i>

01:07.359 --> 01:08.902
<i>Or lack of it.</i>

01:10.320 --> 01:13.156
Keep working, you lazy miscreants.

01:13.657 --> 01:17.286
If my replicator is not
operational soon... Argh!

01:17.744 --> 01:20.289
More heads will roll.

01:30.465 --> 01:31.465
How's it coming, Vera?

01:31.508 --> 01:34.720
Shh! She's in the zone.
Don't mess with her flow.

01:35.262 --> 01:37.014
Distraction is not a problem, Parker.

01:37.264 --> 01:41.184
I am capable of multitasking up to
16 different simultaneous functions.

01:41.268 --> 01:44.563
Right now, in addition to
decrypting the sphere's code,

01:44.646 --> 01:46.690
I am finishing an assignment
for physics class,

01:46.773 --> 01:50.110
perusing social media,
and cataloging your lunch choices.

01:50.694 --> 01:52.154
My lunch choices? Really?

01:52.237 --> 01:53.363
Yes.

01:53.822 --> 01:55.616
Cold pizza appears to be your preference.

01:56.491 --> 01:57.784
It's the perfect meal.

01:57.951 --> 02:01.038
All the food groups deliciously
layered together.

02:02.039 --> 02:03.498
Do you want a bite?

02:03.874 --> 02:05.417
No, thank you.

02:05.792 --> 02:09.086
My research suggests that congealed cheese
causes flatulence.

02:16.595 --> 02:19.222
Here. Perhaps you should add
some of these to your pizza.

02:19.556 --> 02:20.974
These are breath mints, Vera.

02:21.058 --> 02:21.933
Yes.

02:22.017 --> 02:24.478
They may reduce the pungent odor
you are emitting.

02:29.650 --> 02:33.153
You crack open that sphere yet, Vera?
Lunch period's almost over.

02:33.737 --> 02:35.989
The decrypting process is nearly complete.

02:37.658 --> 02:40.827
Are those breath mints on your pizza?

02:41.286 --> 02:42.287
Mmm-hmm.

02:42.371 --> 02:44.081
Part of my new favorite topping combo.

02:47.751 --> 02:49.503
You're very strange.

02:49.586 --> 02:51.797
The decrypting process is complete.

02:51.880 --> 02:53.298
Please stand by.

03:13.819 --> 03:15.112
Whoa.

03:17.447 --> 03:19.699
It looks like some sort of video file.

03:23.245 --> 03:25.455
Wait, that's my dad's lab.

03:26.915 --> 03:28.208
In our old garage.

03:30.710 --> 03:32.879
<i>Entry test 8.1.</i>

03:33.505 --> 03:34.798
That's my dad.

03:39.261 --> 03:41.805
No way. It's Armstrong!

03:42.180 --> 03:43.460
What's he doing with your mouse?

03:46.768 --> 03:49.271
<i>One giant leap for mouse-kind.</i>

03:59.072 --> 04:00.574
Did that just happen?

04:03.618 --> 04:06.788
<i>Okay.
Armstrong, you're in cyberspace.</i>

04:11.668 --> 04:14.045
<i>Now let's try the extraction.</i>

04:31.480 --> 04:32.564
<i>It worked.</i>

04:32.647 --> 04:34.149
<i>The tech works.</i>

04:34.983 --> 04:36.526
<i>Congrats, little guy.</i>

04:36.610 --> 04:39.196
<i>You're the first Next-Generation Guardian.</i>

04:41.907 --> 04:44.242
That is the end of the video file.

04:45.327 --> 04:48.830
Dude, you know what this means, right?

04:50.999 --> 04:52.125
Yeah.

04:58.340 --> 05:00.258
My dad created the Guardian Code.

05:16.274 --> 05:21.488
So all of this, room zero, the Codec...

05:23.073 --> 05:25.784
my dad must have made it while
he was a teacher here.

05:27.911 --> 05:29.746
Vera, he must have made you, too.

05:30.539 --> 05:33.667
That has a probability of 99.9%,

05:34.584 --> 05:36.670
although I have no recollection of him.

05:36.753 --> 05:40.799
Dude. You're like Vera's brother
from another motherboard.

05:43.260 --> 05:45.679
Well, now we know why
you're the leader.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.056
Your dad made that call.

05:48.139 --> 05:50.100
Yeah, and it was a good call.

05:51.393 --> 05:54.271
What I don't get is why he didn't tell me
about any of this.

05:54.896 --> 05:58.358
Perhaps it was his intention
but he never got the opportunity.

05:58.525 --> 06:00.902
Maybe we should go check
his lab in the garage.

06:01.069 --> 06:02.320
Is his stuff still there?

06:02.404 --> 06:03.905
Uh, no.

06:03.989 --> 06:07.742
The lab was actually at their old house,
that burned down in the fire.

06:08.243 --> 06:09.803
More like an explosion, really, that...

06:09.828 --> 06:11.538
Can we not talk about it?

06:13.164 --> 06:14.499
Yeah, sorry.

06:15.083 --> 06:18.378
Vera? Uh, can you find out if
there are any more spheres?

06:18.962 --> 06:21.107
I've got a feeling this is only
the first piece of a puzzle.

06:21.131 --> 06:22.716
I have already anticipated this

06:22.799 --> 06:25.010
and have entered the sphere's
unique code signature

06:25.093 --> 06:26.970
into the Codec's tracking system.

06:27.512 --> 06:28.430
Okay.

06:28.513 --> 06:30.223
So who's in for a sphere hunt?

06:30.307 --> 06:31.349
I have math class.

06:31.433 --> 06:33.101
Vera and I have physics.

06:33.935 --> 06:35.228
We have a free period.

06:35.312 --> 06:36.712
Looks like it's you and me, Parker.

06:37.772 --> 06:40.609
Maybe you should wait
until all of us can go.

06:40.692 --> 06:43.570
It's just a scouting mission.
It'll be fine.

06:44.195 --> 06:45.447
Okay with you, Vera?

06:45.989 --> 06:46.990
Yes.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.451
But please use caution.

06:49.534 --> 06:53.371
There is a 7% probability
that something will go wrong.

06:53.455 --> 06:55.540
Nothing's gonna go wrong.

06:55.832 --> 06:57.834
I will monitor you but I cannot
have direct contact

06:57.917 --> 06:59.878
if I am out of room zero.

06:59.961 --> 07:01.713
Okay. Got it.

07:07.135 --> 07:08.303
There goes our leader.

07:09.054 --> 07:10.347
Captain Daddy's Choice.

07:34.829 --> 07:36.623
Let's check the tracking system.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.585
It's not showing any spheres.

07:40.669 --> 07:43.672
So let's program a search pattern,
see what we can find.

07:52.514 --> 07:56.017
Alpha Sentinel, this is not complete.

07:56.101 --> 07:58.311
Where is the code duplication device?

07:58.395 --> 08:01.064
The replicator cannot function without it.

08:01.147 --> 08:03.233
Yes, Megabyte. It has been located.

08:03.316 --> 08:06.277
Then why are you still here?

08:06.361 --> 08:09.197
Take the war ship and retrieve it at once!

08:09.280 --> 08:10.615
Yes, Megabyte.

08:12.492 --> 08:15.245
Good help is so hard to find.

08:19.207 --> 08:21.626
Ohm's Law states that across two points,

08:21.710 --> 08:25.797
the current is proportional
to the voltage,

08:25.880 --> 08:29.592
hence I, the current,
equals V, the voltage.

08:30.010 --> 08:31.010
Ohm went on to...

08:31.052 --> 08:34.431
Oh, Mr. Daleski, you are so funny.

08:37.392 --> 08:38.703
Do you have something to say, Vera?

08:38.727 --> 08:41.187
I don't respond to students
unless hands are raised.

08:48.278 --> 08:50.238
All right, what is it?

08:58.079 --> 09:01.499
You have equated I with V
but neglected to consider

09:01.583 --> 09:04.586
the constant, R, for resistance.

09:04.961 --> 09:09.007
The equation should be I equals V over R.

09:09.090 --> 09:10.091
A simple mistake.

09:10.175 --> 09:12.010
- Uh, Ohm...
- You mean a minor mistake.

09:12.510 --> 09:14.345
Yes, fine, whatever. Ohm...

09:14.429 --> 09:16.681
Because minor suggests "not egregious"

09:16.765 --> 09:19.392
whereas simple implies unintelligent,

09:19.476 --> 09:22.937
as in the mistake of one
with low intelligence.

09:23.563 --> 09:26.649
And you are not of low intelligence,
are you?

09:26.733 --> 09:30.195
Well, congratulations, Vera,
you've just earned yourself a detention.

09:31.613 --> 09:34.115
Come on, Mr. Deleski, that's not fair.
She was...

09:34.199 --> 09:37.744
Oh, no? Well, you can join your friend
for detention, Tamra.

09:38.870 --> 09:39.870
What?

09:39.913 --> 09:40.789
Yeah, what?

09:40.872 --> 09:43.184
One more word out of you, Shari,
and you'll be there with them.

09:43.208 --> 09:45.001
One word? I've got 20.

09:45.085 --> 09:48.463
According to Section 3.1
of the Alan Turing High constitution,

09:48.546 --> 09:51.758
students have the right to speak freely
regardless of hands raised.

09:51.841 --> 09:54.219
Okay, that was, like, 23 words
but you get the point.

09:55.970 --> 09:57.931
Detention.

10:04.813 --> 10:10.026
The code duplication device is in there.
Prepare for assault and extraction.

10:14.364 --> 10:15.657
Fire!

10:40.014 --> 10:41.117
I was just thinking.

10:41.141 --> 10:43.852
It was your dad who got us hooked
on the <i>Cyber Guardians</i> game.

10:43.935 --> 10:46.896
Yeah, he must have been planning this
for us from the beginning.

10:46.980 --> 10:48.773
Hey, we got one!

10:48.857 --> 10:49.857
All right!

10:49.899 --> 10:51.151
Entering coordinates.

11:03.788 --> 11:06.249
Whoa, that's a lot of traffic.

11:06.332 --> 11:09.586
They don't call it the information
superhighway for nothing.

11:10.545 --> 11:12.547
Well, let's go get that sphere.

11:14.799 --> 11:16.301
Zip board!

11:18.845 --> 11:20.096
Quadra disc!

11:27.270 --> 11:29.856
- Do you see a way in?
- Dude, I see ten.

11:29.939 --> 11:32.025
Hey, watch out for data packets.

11:32.442 --> 11:33.860
Thanks, Mom.

11:33.985 --> 11:35.403
Whoo!

11:38.281 --> 11:40.533
Whoa!

11:40.742 --> 11:42.410
Vector, wait up!

11:42.994 --> 11:44.454
Whoa.

11:45.246 --> 11:47.332
Yeah.

11:47.415 --> 11:49.334
Bingo! There it is.

11:50.168 --> 11:53.296
Okay. Just a little closer.

11:54.339 --> 11:55.840
- Almost...
- Hey, Vector, look out!

11:56.966 --> 11:58.092
Vector!

12:10.021 --> 12:12.941
Vector! Dude, you okay?

12:13.942 --> 12:14.859
I think so.

12:14.943 --> 12:16.903
- I'll scan you for damage.
- Don't bother.

12:16.986 --> 12:18.738
Look what I have.

12:18.821 --> 12:20.365
Yes! You got it!

12:20.448 --> 12:22.009
<i>- Breaking news...
- Breaking...</i>

12:22.033 --> 12:23.093
<i>Breaking news.</i>

12:23.117 --> 12:26.079
<i>The Dopple laboratory conducting
3D replication experiments</i>

12:26.162 --> 12:28.581
<i>for the military has been hacked.</i>

12:29.082 --> 12:30.458
We should check that out.

12:30.541 --> 12:31.918
What, like now?

12:32.001 --> 12:35.463
Yes. We're Guardians.
It's what my dad wanted us to do.

12:37.173 --> 12:38.466
Zip board!

12:42.845 --> 12:45.390
The code duplication
device is secure.

12:46.057 --> 12:47.057
Up there.

12:47.100 --> 12:49.727
That's the lab the news report
said is being hacked.

12:49.936 --> 12:51.771
By Megabyte's sentinels.

12:51.854 --> 12:53.832
Hey, it looks like they're
getting ready to leave.

12:53.856 --> 12:55.108
Not without us.

12:55.191 --> 12:56.567
Cyber hook!

12:58.361 --> 12:59.570
Come on!

13:02.031 --> 13:04.075
They must be heading back
to Megabyte's fortress.

13:04.158 --> 13:06.160
Uh, in case that hit you took
in the data stream

13:06.244 --> 13:07.412
affected your memory,

13:07.495 --> 13:09.872
we didn't have too much fun
the last time we were there.

13:09.956 --> 13:13.376
We're just scouting. We'll find out what
he's up to and report back.

13:24.470 --> 13:27.348
The code duplication device
has been installed, Megabyte.

13:27.432 --> 13:29.142
Excellent.

13:29.225 --> 13:31.644
Let the replication begin!

13:51.622 --> 13:52.749
This is bad.

13:52.874 --> 13:55.793
Megabyte's building
a mega army of sentinels.

13:56.210 --> 13:57.646
We have to shut down that replicator.

13:57.670 --> 13:59.547
What happened to check it out
and report back?

13:59.630 --> 14:02.175
Change of plans. We have to stop him, now.

14:02.258 --> 14:03.551
Come on.

14:07.930 --> 14:08.848
Can you hack it?

14:08.931 --> 14:11.350
Does an isosceles triangle have
two equal sides?

14:11.684 --> 14:12.935
For the record, it does.

14:13.019 --> 14:15.188
Whatever you say. Just do it.

14:15.646 --> 14:18.066
I'm gonna later the G code
with a hack blast.

14:18.858 --> 14:19.858
Let's move.

14:19.901 --> 14:21.861
This thing's gonna detonate any second.

14:30.661 --> 14:31.954
Intruders!

14:35.625 --> 14:39.003
Catch those Guardians
and bring them to me at once!

14:40.380 --> 14:43.716
Must I do everything myself?

14:56.479 --> 14:58.398
I find detention extremely boring.

14:58.481 --> 15:01.442
Just finish the equations.

15:02.068 --> 15:03.152
I have.

15:09.575 --> 15:10.868
What's up, Vera?

15:11.119 --> 15:14.539
I'm detecting high-stress alerts
from Vector and Googz.

15:14.622 --> 15:17.792
We must get to room zero. Immediately.

15:17.917 --> 15:23.005
Ladies... do you want
an additional hour of detention?

15:30.221 --> 15:31.556
Can you get us out of here?

15:40.189 --> 15:41.190
Done.

15:41.482 --> 15:43.901
What's going on?

15:46.654 --> 15:48.781
That's the emergency evacuation alarm.

15:48.865 --> 15:51.993
Everybody out now. Now.

15:52.994 --> 15:55.079
That was a bit much but it worked.

16:10.386 --> 16:13.598
<i>Vector? Googz?
What are you doing in Megabyte's fortress?</i>

16:13.681 --> 16:14.557
Long story.

16:14.640 --> 16:17.268
But we could use a couple more Guardians
to help get us out.

16:18.102 --> 16:19.228
Okay.

16:19.854 --> 16:21.481
Vera, I got your message. What's up?

16:21.564 --> 16:23.941
Lots. I'll explain on the way.

16:28.863 --> 16:30.156
The coast is clear.

16:30.239 --> 16:31.324
Let's make a break for it.

16:32.909 --> 16:34.702
Correction, the coast was clear.

16:36.704 --> 16:37.955
Code disruptor!

16:39.957 --> 16:41.125
Deflector ring!

16:43.127 --> 16:44.127
Zip board!

16:50.301 --> 16:51.761
You guys need practice.

16:51.844 --> 16:54.084
You shoot like you were just
replicated five minutes ago.

16:54.597 --> 16:55.598
Whoa!

16:57.517 --> 16:58.809
Uh-oh, detour.

17:02.522 --> 17:03.523
No!

17:04.815 --> 17:06.943
Guardians, Guardians.

17:07.026 --> 17:11.656
When will you learn that sneaking
into my fortress is most unacceptable?

17:11.739 --> 17:13.366
I guess we missed that class.

17:13.449 --> 17:15.826
Alpha Sentinel, seize them.

17:15.910 --> 17:17.244
Yes, Megabyte.

17:21.999 --> 17:23.416
Someone call for backup?

17:23.960 --> 17:25.920
Nice of you guys to drop in.

17:26.002 --> 17:29.674
If you insist on being so destructive,

17:29.757 --> 17:31.968
I will have to teach you manners!

17:32.134 --> 17:33.594
Cyber shield!

17:36.889 --> 17:37.932
Frag fists!

17:44.021 --> 17:45.940
Whoa! Whoa!

17:50.069 --> 17:52.238
Googz! We could use a little protection.

17:52.321 --> 17:54.156
Sure thing. Fire wall!

17:54.615 --> 17:57.451
Your firewall won't last long.

17:57.535 --> 18:00.329
Alpha Sentinel! Attack!

18:01.205 --> 18:02.957
I think maybe it's time to leave.

18:03.040 --> 18:05.084
- What about the sphere?
- Too risky.

18:05.167 --> 18:06.395
We gotta get outta here, D-Frag.

18:06.419 --> 18:07.878
Turbo jets!

18:07.962 --> 18:09.130
Grab on.

18:11.882 --> 18:13.467
Later, Megaloser!

18:13.551 --> 18:15.720
Argh!

18:36.073 --> 18:39.493
Rescue operation data indicates
the mission was a success.

18:41.412 --> 18:43.789
Yeah, except we wouldn't
have needed to be rescued

18:43.873 --> 18:45.249
if I had stuck to the plan.

18:45.333 --> 18:46.375
Good point.

18:46.459 --> 18:48.794
Yeah, but we stopped Megabyte
from replicating sentinels.

18:48.878 --> 18:50.171
That's huge.

18:50.755 --> 18:52.173
Also a good point.

18:52.548 --> 18:53.633
It's Okay.

18:53.716 --> 18:55.468
We're all still new at this.

18:55.718 --> 18:59.055
Yeah. But I messed up. Big time.

19:00.681 --> 19:04.143
I went in there to find more spheres,
and found one and lost it.

19:04.226 --> 19:05.269
Correct.

19:05.353 --> 19:07.146
But we now know the location
of that sphere

19:07.229 --> 19:09.440
and we will continue to search for more.

19:09.523 --> 19:11.692
You guys should have seen Vector
in the data stream.

19:11.776 --> 19:15.071
It was like the most extreme
half-pipe ride ever.

19:15.363 --> 19:18.115
The most extreme wipeout ever.

19:18.199 --> 19:20.159
Oh, I got slammed.

19:20.701 --> 19:24.455
Hey, your father would have been proud
of what you did today.

19:24.997 --> 19:26.374
Yeah?

19:28.084 --> 19:29.293
Yeah.

19:32.171 --> 19:36.133
Just... don't do it again.

19:45.643 --> 19:48.729
You failed me, Alpha Sentinel.

19:48.813 --> 19:50.981
You let the Guardians get away!

19:51.065 --> 19:53.192
It won't happen again, Megabyte.

19:53.275 --> 19:55.569
No, it won't.

20:00.533 --> 20:04.495
I appear to have an opening
for a new Alpha Sentinel.

20:04.787 --> 20:06.872
Any volunteers?

20:09.333 --> 20:10.793
Excellent.

20:10.876 --> 20:13.045
Here's your promotion.

20:18.092 --> 20:22.221
Oh, what have we here?

20:22.304 --> 20:25.349
The Guardians must have left it behind.

20:26.726 --> 20:30.730
Well, it's mine now.

20:32.898 --> 20:34.275
<i>Okay.</i>

20:35.067 --> 20:36.861
<i>Armstrong, you're in cyberspace.</i>

20:38.738 --> 20:40.781
<i>Now let's try the extraction.</i>

20:55.838 --> 20:58.048
<i>It worked! The tech works!</i>

20:59.175 --> 21:00.676
<i>Congrats, little guy.</i>

21:00.760 --> 21:03.596
<i>You're the first Next-Generation Guardian.</i>

21:07.558 --> 21:09.769
I wonder what other secrets
Dad had.
