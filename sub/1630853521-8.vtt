<i> andre armstrong is in town.</i>

00:03.854 --> 00:04.787
He broke your heart.

00:04.822 --> 00:06.872
A father never forgets
something like that.

00:06.907 --> 00:08.157
You didn't get closure.

00:08.192 --> 00:09.992
You need closure.

00:10.027 --> 00:11.543
Lo, do you still have
feelings for andre?

00:19.536 --> 00:20.702
Your honor, mr. Rivera
repeatedly failed

00:20.721 --> 00:22.504
to show up at meetings
with his probation officer.

00:22.539 --> 00:24.039
A search of his home
was ordered

00:24.058 --> 00:26.225
where illegal narcotics
were found and seized.

00:26.260 --> 00:29.878
Mr. Rivera, I must say I am
not pleased by this reunion.

00:29.897 --> 00:32.364
A year ago you stood
in this very spot

00:32.400 --> 00:35.350
and were found guilty
of felony possession for sale.

00:35.385 --> 00:37.102
With four years prison
suspended, your honor.

00:37.154 --> 00:39.521
Yeah, I think the court knows
the record, mr. Callan,

00:39.556 --> 00:42.557
which includes this defendant
suffering a horrific injury

00:42.576 --> 00:43.725
in a workplace accident

00:43.744 --> 00:46.361
that made it impossible
for him to support his family.

00:46.396 --> 00:49.231
I did not know that you were
representing the defendant,
ms. Lopez.

00:49.250 --> 00:50.398
She's not.

00:50.418 --> 00:52.400
Ms. Lopez has offered
her services

00:52.420 --> 00:54.586
in linking my client
to special programs.

00:54.622 --> 00:56.672
That is all that she is doing.

01:00.127 --> 01:02.410
I sentenced you
to four years in prison.

01:02.430 --> 01:05.130
But based on the circumstances
referenced by ms. Lopez,

01:05.182 --> 01:08.100
I suspended that prison term
and granted you probation,

01:08.135 --> 01:09.468
which you violated.

01:09.520 --> 01:10.886
I'm sorry. I tried to make
some meetings,

01:10.921 --> 01:12.604
but there was something
going on with my son and I...

01:12.640 --> 01:15.307
Following
mr. Rivera's accident,

01:15.359 --> 01:17.759
he was prescribed
oxycodone for pain.

01:17.778 --> 01:20.612
He is suffering from addiction
and he needs treatment.

01:20.648 --> 01:23.598
The court gave him that chance
already, your honor,

01:23.617 --> 01:25.267
and now he's back.
What's different?

01:25.286 --> 01:28.103
Well, what's different is
the original program was
not a good fit,

01:28.122 --> 01:29.437
so he fell through cracks.

01:29.457 --> 01:33.125
-Your honor,
our office is overloaded.
-You mean my office?

01:33.160 --> 01:35.043
[scoffs] you've only been
a pd for a hot second.

01:35.946 --> 01:37.112
[lola] okay, ms. Lopez.

01:37.131 --> 01:38.664
Please step back.

01:38.716 --> 01:40.582
-Yeah.
-[lola] take a seat.
Thank you.

01:40.617 --> 01:41.917
Mr. Watkins,

01:41.952 --> 01:43.502
reserve your arguments
for the court.

01:44.972 --> 01:46.421
-[knocking]
-come in.

01:46.456 --> 01:48.290
You've got mail.

01:48.309 --> 01:50.092
What is up
with emily and luke?

01:50.127 --> 01:53.628
[sighing] oh, gosh.
There is so much electricity
between those two.

01:53.647 --> 01:55.130
All I know is they need
to learn how to play

01:55.149 --> 01:57.015
-on the same side
of my courtroom.
-[sherri sighs]

01:57.067 --> 01:58.100
-[knocking]
-[door opens]

02:00.187 --> 02:01.854
do you have a moment?

02:01.906 --> 02:04.189
Of course for you,
judge marshall.

02:04.241 --> 02:07.993
I saw that<i> people v. Rivera</i>
is back on the calendar.

02:08.028 --> 02:10.478
I'm presuming that you imposed
your original sentence?

02:10.498 --> 02:12.814
I have not made my ruling yet.

02:12.833 --> 02:16.368
Our calendars are filled
with more cases
than we can handle.

02:16.420 --> 02:19.487
Repeat offenders need to be
dealt with expeditiously.

02:19.507 --> 02:21.323
This man is facing
years in prison.

02:21.342 --> 02:25.660
My dad lost his leg
in the korean war.

02:25.679 --> 02:28.563
Through determination
he was able to put
food on the table

02:28.582 --> 02:31.383
without committing
anni.

02:31.402 --> 02:33.602
Your father sounds like
a remarkable man.

02:39.944 --> 02:43.328
I swear we need to put
a gps tracker on that man!

02:44.248 --> 02:45.364
[sighs]

02:46.283 --> 02:47.899
but maybe
judge marshall is right.

02:47.918 --> 02:51.253
Just seeing defendants
back in my courtroom,

02:51.288 --> 02:53.789
sometimes I wonder if I'm
really making a difference.

02:56.293 --> 02:59.711
You've been invited to be
on the law and technology
panel at stanford.

03:02.132 --> 03:03.715
This is big deal.

03:03.750 --> 03:06.685
-Silicon valley

-[sherri] mmm-hmm!

03:07.805 --> 03:10.556
Three ninth circuit justices?

03:10.591 --> 03:14.977
And now the honorable
judge lola carmichael.

03:15.029 --> 03:16.645
-[sherri squeals]
-oh, they would put me up

03:16.697 --> 03:18.947

03:33.547 --> 03:34.796
[lola] "well," what?

03:34.832 --> 03:37.082
You're not a cyber law
specialist, lo.

03:37.117 --> 03:38.283
It seems like
a bit of a coincidence

03:38.302 --> 03:40.002
that andre's firm
is inviting you.

03:40.054 --> 03:42.588
You're saying
I wouldn't have been invited
if I didn't know andré?

03:42.623 --> 03:44.256
That what I do
is of no impact?

03:44.291 --> 03:45.674
[whispering]
seems a bit tiny town.

03:45.726 --> 03:49.144
I have done zoom trials
and virtual hearings.

03:49.179 --> 03:50.846
Yeah, you're a regular
steve jobs.

03:52.066 --> 03:55.100
There is nothing going on
with dré and me, okay?

03:55.135 --> 03:57.152
I was just seeking
your professional advice.

03:57.187 --> 04:00.105
My professional advice
is you should pass.

04:00.140 --> 04:01.740
We both know robin's
already managing a lot.

04:03.027 --> 04:05.027
Okay, before you start
judging my relationship,

04:05.079 --> 04:06.445
how about you just
focus on your own?

04:06.480 --> 04:07.996
What the hell does that mean?

04:08.032 --> 04:10.449
Just because your fiancée
has you in some weird
love triangle

04:10.484 --> 04:11.667
-with her husband
-whoa.

04:11.702 --> 04:13.351
Doesn't mean
I'm doing anything wrong.

04:13.370 --> 04:14.886
-Robin and I are fine.
-[scoffs]

04:14.939 --> 04:16.688
hey, didn't you tell rachel

04:16.724 --> 04:21.126
that you
didn't feel comfortable
with her dating dré?

04:21.145 --> 04:22.460
Wonder how she'd feel
about do you know what? Trip

04:22.479 --> 04:23.845

I came down here
to talk to you.

-Fine.

I thought you were
coming home early today?

04:33.657 --> 04:35.524
This is the first task force
I've been on

04:35.576 --> 04:36.808
in two years, lola.

04:36.827 --> 04:38.643
I know. I'm sorry.

04:38.662 --> 04:41.313
I didn't think
my morning hearing
would spill over.

04:41.332 --> 04:43.648
Here is the rivera file,

04:43.667 --> 04:48.620
and would you like me
to<i> réponde "oui" ou "non"</i>
to the stanford conference?

04:49.423 --> 04:51.123
[mouthing] it's robin.

04:51.158 --> 04:57.179
<i> -What stanford conference?</i>
-It is a legal conference
at stanford.

04:57.214 --> 04:59.131
-[mouthing] sorry.
-[robin] oh,
doesn't that look fun?

04:59.166 --> 05:01.717
You will never guess
whose firm is sponsoring it.

05:02.386 --> 05:04.502
André armstrong.

05:04.521 --> 05:05.971
Your ex's firm.

05:07.358 --> 05:08.807
You're really
considering going?

05:08.842 --> 05:10.842
Oh, and let me guess,

05:10.861 --> 05:14.479
you expect me
to solo parent once again
while you and he hang out?

05:14.514 --> 05:19.184
Okay. Dré and I
aren't gonna be hanging out.

05:19.203 --> 05:21.453
Dré? Hmm.

with the edmonds foundation,

06:33.026 --> 06:34.592
-mmm.
-Then the
national urban league,

06:34.611 --> 06:36.561
and today is your
mink and fox luncheon

06:36.596 --> 06:38.146
in edgartown
for your announcement.

06:38.198 --> 06:41.733
Don't forget to ask the nanny
to pack extra fruit waters
and vegan sandwiches

06:41.768 --> 06:43.318
for the kids
for their sailing lesson

06:43.370 --> 06:47.372
and, yes,
my campaign begins today.

06:48.158 --> 06:49.607
It's about time

06:51.962 --> 06:53.662
-Hey.
-Hey, babe.

07:03.841 --> 07:05.841
Maybe I should wear it up
for edgartown.

07:05.893 --> 07:06.925
It's a bit humid.

07:11.515 --> 07:15.100
Luke, how are you?
What are you doing?

07:15.135 --> 07:19.137
I am trying to finish up
the nursery.

07:19.156 --> 07:20.188
Maggie wants it done

07:20.240 --> 07:21.440

from her trip.

07:28.999 --> 07:30.782
I'm going as mark's plus one

07:30.817 --> 07:32.501

private babymoon.

07:33.086 --> 07:34.369
I can't.

07:34.421 --> 07:37.155

a huge event in the vineyard

to throw me out of book club

07:39.259 --> 07:40.459
if I missed it.

07:40.494 --> 07:42.043
It would really mean
a lot to mark.

07:42.095 --> 07:44.329
Mark's not talking to me
so I find that odd.

07:44.348 --> 07:45.680
I know he wants
to clear the air

07:45.716 --> 07:46.681
and apologize.

07:46.717 --> 07:48.383
That boy never apologizes.

four years ago.

10:37.654 --> 10:40.021
-[banging]
-[woman] so sorry.

10:40.056 --> 10:41.439
Oh, sorry. [laughs]

10:41.491 --> 10:44.342
morning, sunshine.
Where should I set up?

10:44.378 --> 10:46.778
Our appointment is tomorrow
and it's at my home.

10:46.830 --> 10:51.850
Oh, mark, I'm feeling
some really bad chi.

10:51.885 --> 10:54.736
-Lay the fuck off.
-Emily.

10:54.755 --> 10:56.621
-Hey, guys.
How was the ob-gyn?
-[groans]

10:56.673 --> 11:00.074
she told the doctor
that she is still
drinking coffee.

11:00.093 --> 11:01.909
Because it is fucking fine
in moderation.

11:01.928 --> 11:04.245
-My god,
the baby is just fine.
-[humming]

11:04.264 --> 11:06.181
luke, look who's here.

11:08.301 --> 11:11.603
-You came.
-Yeah. Hi.

11:11.638 --> 11:14.139
I am so sorry
that you just saw that.

11:14.191 --> 11:18.109
-Let me just do some reiki
to just rebalance your energy.
-[sighs] fuck me.

11:18.145 --> 11:22.597
Lola, this is amy,
my massage therapist
slash luke and maggie's doula,

11:22.616 --> 11:24.816
and emily, their surrogate.

11:24.868 --> 11:27.952
Oh, my god, again.
I'm gonna need-- stop.

11:27.988 --> 11:29.821
I'm gonna need you
to stop defining me.

11:29.873 --> 11:32.824
Like I said,
this pregnancy thing
is a side hustle.

11:32.876 --> 11:35.744
I'm gonna be a vet,
or work for nasa,

11:35.779 --> 11:37.462
or, I don't know,
maybe life coach.

11:37.497 --> 11:40.799
-Ambitious.
-Wait, aren't you,
what do you...

11:40.834 --> 11:43.468
-[whispering] what a bitch.
-Law school lola,
the rich bitch?

11:43.503 --> 11:46.421
I need everyone to leave,
please, except for lola.

11:46.456 --> 11:49.674
I will see you later, lola.
I need to go tame a shrew.

11:49.726 --> 11:51.059
[emily]
that's really fucking cute.

11:51.094 --> 11:52.627
You know what?
I'm gonna need you
to kiss my whole pregnant ass,

11:52.646 --> 11:53.628
-[groans]
-okay?

11:53.647 --> 11:55.980
-Kiss it.
-If my baby comes out

11:56.016 --> 11:58.183
-kiss it. I really
want you to kiss it.
-Cussing like a teamster...

11:58.235 --> 12:00.301
-What are you gonna do
if the baby comes out like me?
-See you. I'm sorry.

12:00.320 --> 12:03.154
-Sorry. Oh.
-You should only be so lucky.

12:03.190 --> 12:04.689
-Sorry.
-Emily.

12:04.741 --> 12:06.991
[indistinct shouting]

12:07.027 --> 12:10.862
luke's whole situation
is interesting.

12:12.032 --> 12:14.616
-Where were we?
-I figured you wanted
to clear the air

12:14.651 --> 12:16.668
-before the reunion.
-About what?

12:18.088 --> 12:21.706
We've barely been in touch
since the blowout
at my wedding.

12:21.758 --> 12:24.459
I had a bit too much to drink,
said a few things.

12:24.494 --> 12:27.579
You told me
I was throwing away
my law degree

12:27.614 --> 12:28.980
in front of ev

12:29.015 --> 12:30.681
nice reception speech.

12:30.700 --> 12:33.368
You graduated
summa cum laude,
order of the coif.

12:33.403 --> 12:35.537
We were co-editors in chief
of the law review.

12:35.572 --> 12:37.205
I am raising a family,

12:37.240 --> 12:39.157
and utilizing
my legal knowledge

12:39.192 --> 12:43.328
with multiple
international charities
and service organizations.

12:43.363 --> 12:45.547
-You were brilliant.
-Were.

12:45.582 --> 12:48.133
So you have been judging me.

12:49.302 --> 12:51.336
You know,
for your information,

12:51.371 --> 12:54.088
based on the<i> mad hatter's</i>
avocado tea party,
I'm not missing much.

12:54.141 --> 12:56.591
Avocado gate
is not a typical case.

12:56.643 --> 13:00.061
Oh, I'm sure you put
plenty of people away.

13:00.096 --> 13:05.683
All a part of
our flawed justice system,
permeated by systemic racism,

13:05.718 --> 13:10.054
that ends with judges like you
sitting helplessly on a bench

13:10.073 --> 13:13.775
as generations
of black and brown people
are incarcerated.

13:16.780 --> 13:21.833
Have work to do,
and I'm sure you have
tea and nchelu to attend.

13:39.002 --> 13:39.834
Lola?

13:42.405 --> 13:43.938
Robin.

13:43.974 --> 13:46.474
-Oh, my god.
-Wow.

13:47.527 --> 13:49.861
Lola carmichael
from new crenshaw.

13:50.763 --> 13:56.117
-... Robbie robbo bass. Bass.
-[laughs]

13:56.152 --> 13:59.320
-bang, bang, bang.
-[both laugh]

13:59.372 --> 14:02.457
-what are you doing here?
-I had a meeting
with one of my clients,

14:02.492 --> 14:04.275
shakira.

14:04.294 --> 14:08.913
-Wow. Big time music producer.
-Hey. How you been?

14:08.948 --> 14:11.966
Are you home visiting?
We should go have a drink
at the bar.

14:12.002 --> 14:14.952
Oh, I am actually...

14:14.971 --> 14:18.256
-Meeting my [stutters]
husband for lunch,
-oh.

14:18.291 --> 14:19.424
But how's your wife?

14:20.644 --> 14:24.429
-That is a good question.
-What do you mean?

14:25.982 --> 14:26.814
I'm leaving her.

14:29.736 --> 14:30.652
Oh.

14:46.136 --> 14:47.835
[clears throat]

14:47.888 --> 14:52.674
-there she is. [laughs]
-hi. Look at you.

14:52.726 --> 14:56.344
-Seriously, you did not
have to pick me up.
-Mmm.

14:56.396 --> 14:59.147
It's the least that I can do
after what happened
this morning.

14:59.182 --> 15:01.266
-Oh, you should feel guilty.
-[clears throat]

15:01.301 --> 15:04.302
you set me up.
Mark had no clue I was coming.

15:04.321 --> 15:07.471
I may have slightly
stretched the truth
about mark wanting you here,

15:07.490 --> 15:11.826
-which he does inside.
-Mmm, deep, deep inside.

15:11.861 --> 15:14.028
-Weren't you trying
to butter me up?
-Yes.

15:14.080 --> 15:16.447
-It's working.
-So, let's talk
about the text.

15:16.482 --> 15:18.583
How was it
seeing robin this morning?

15:19.869 --> 15:22.787
-It was no big deal.
-[scoffs] I believe you.

15:22.822 --> 15:24.289
[laughs]

15:25.342 --> 15:27.342
-oh, we need to go.
-Mmm.

15:31.881 --> 15:33.648
-Oh.
-Mmm?

15:33.683 --> 15:38.886
-Rachel is going.
-Oh, your former bestie
turned frenemy.

15:38.939 --> 15:42.557
-Oh, shit,
and she is married to...
-Yes and yes.

15:42.609 --> 15:44.559
I'm a little wound up.

15:44.611 --> 15:49.680
And if you elect me
as your next mink and fox
national president

15:49.699 --> 15:54.869
I will continue
to use my influence
for important issues

15:54.904 --> 15:57.739
-like improving...
-[woman] sorry, sorry.

15:57.791 --> 15:59.540
Sorry, I'm so sorry.
Court ran late.

15:59.576 --> 16:03.661
Cornel west's federal action
against harvard finally ended.

16:03.696 --> 16:05.496
-We won. [laughs]
-[all applauding]

16:08.301 --> 16:11.035
but, lola, keep going.
[mouthing] sorry.

16:11.054 --> 16:13.504
Thank you. Where was I?

16:13.539 --> 16:15.390
For important causes

16:15.425 --> 16:17.425
-like the much needed
improvements
-hi, pamela.

16:17.477 --> 16:20.178
-In the infrastructure
of our historically
-[indistinct conversation]

16:20.213 --> 16:23.097
black colleges
and universities.

16:23.149 --> 16:27.185
-Georgina, who does your hair?
-I hope I have
your vote and...

16:27.220 --> 16:30.221
-Rachel.
-[gasps] yes?

16:30.240 --> 16:33.441
-Sounds like you have more
you want to share with us.
-[mouthing] oh, no, no.

16:33.493 --> 16:37.862
-Oh, don't be so modest.
Rachel audubon, ladies.
-[all applauding]

16:38.915 --> 16:41.499
oh, shucks. [giggles]

16:42.402 --> 16:44.869
-thank you, lola.
-Of course.

16:44.904 --> 16:47.121
-Yes.
-Mmm-hmm.

16:47.173 --> 16:53.411
My family has stood with
this exclusive organization
always.

16:53.430 --> 16:56.914
My great-great-grandmother
was one of the first

16:56.933 --> 16:59.717
mink and fox charter members
of new England.

16:59.752 --> 17:02.970
-Well, mink and fox
is always looking
-[microphone feedback]

17:03.023 --> 17:06.090
-for impassioned volunteers,
right, ladies?
-Right.

17:06.109 --> 17:07.975
-[microphone feedback]
-precisely.

17:08.028 --> 17:10.445
So after some soul searching

17:10.480 --> 17:14.732
and heavy convincing
from all my
influencer friends here,

17:14.767 --> 17:19.070
I'm thrilled to announce
that I'm also running
for national president.

17:19.105 --> 17:20.488
-[laughs]
-[all applauding]

17:21.774 --> 17:25.159
now, please,
enjoy the prosecco,
courtesy of moi.

17:28.331 --> 17:30.448
[attendee]
excuse me, can we get
a photo of you two?

17:30.467 --> 17:31.966
-Take a picture.
-Thank you.

17:34.120 --> 17:36.170
What game
are you playing, audubon?

17:36.222 --> 17:39.807
You know you don't give a damn
about being president
of mink & fox.

17:39.843 --> 17:42.260
I'm old money.
These are my people.

17:42.295 --> 17:43.761
You just married into it.

17:44.731 --> 17:47.798
So, you're telling me you want

17:47.817 --> 17:51.436
to run a major
service organization?

17:51.471 --> 17:56.324
I just got a federal court
to enjoin a voting rights
suppression bill

17:56.359 --> 17:57.525
in alabama.

17:59.028 --> 18:02.780
Apart from that eight carat
wedding ring dré gave you,

18:03.700 --> 18:05.166
what experience do you have

18:05.201 --> 18:09.036
that makes you
leadership material
for this elite organization?

18:12.592 --> 18:14.492
I think I will have a glass
of champagne.

18:14.511 --> 18:15.510
[waiter] there you are.

18:16.346 --> 18:17.512
-Thank you.
-[waiter] enjoy.

18:17.547 --> 18:18.763
I know you saw
robin this morning.

18:19.682 --> 18:22.166
So maybe the real question is

18:22.185 --> 18:25.103
what game are you playing at
with my husband?

18:29.442 --> 18:31.559
[andré]<i> don't tell me</i>
<i> rachel audubon</i>
<i> is getting to you.</i>

18:31.611 --> 18:32.727
No.

18:34.063 --> 18:35.530
Maybe.

18:35.565 --> 18:36.898
-[laughing]
-just a little.

18:38.785 --> 18:41.185
[exclaims] when we first met,

18:41.204 --> 18:43.654
I was clerking
on the ninth circuit

18:43.689 --> 18:46.491
and could've had any
legal position I wanted,

18:46.526 --> 18:48.993
and now, I can barely
remember that person.

18:50.046 --> 18:51.996
What happened?

18:52.031 --> 18:55.049
When I look at our kids
and see how happy they are,
I am in awe.

18:56.035 --> 18:58.336
I know my baby's brilliant.

18:58.371 --> 19:00.371
Rachel can't help herself,
you know how she is.

19:00.390 --> 19:02.256
Yeah.

19:02.308 --> 19:04.875
-[andré] mmm-hmm.
-Baby, we're going to be late.

19:04.894 --> 19:05.893
[andré] okay.

19:07.063 --> 19:09.514
Okay, maybe we can be
a little late.

19:09.549 --> 19:11.432
[both laughing]

19:11.451 --> 19:13.701
[phone ringing]

19:14.654 --> 19:16.571
hold this for me.

19:16.606 --> 19:17.622
-[andré] thank you.
-Thank you.

19:17.657 --> 19:18.789
[sighs]

19:20.877 --> 19:21.742
yeah?

19:23.379 --> 19:24.412
Oh.

19:25.381 --> 19:26.214
Please...

19:27.500 --> 19:30.117
Please telngressman
I will be right down.

19:30.136 --> 19:33.171
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

19:33.223 --> 19:34.338
I know.

19:34.390 --> 19:35.923
[charles]
and then I get a call
from the white house

19:35.958 --> 19:37.842
that the president needs
to see me asap,

19:37.894 --> 19:40.811
but I know he just wants
my caucus to support...

19:40.847 --> 19:43.681
What did I tell you
about doing that
when we're conversing?

19:45.134 --> 19:47.268
But I'm glad you're here.

19:48.471 --> 19:50.471
I've been thinking
about our plans

19:50.490 --> 19:52.323
to get you onto
the supreme court.

19:52.358 --> 19:53.741
You mean your plan.

19:53.776 --> 19:57.978
We've got rebuild your resume.
I'm setting up a meeting
with nancy--

19:57.997 --> 20:01.782
daddy, you don't
have to always be managing
my life, okay?

20:01.817 --> 20:04.318
Well, if it wasn't for me,
you might've ended up married

20:04.337 --> 20:08.206
to that starving musician,
robin taylor.

20:08.258 --> 20:09.674
God, you sound like mom.

20:09.709 --> 20:11.959
You're lucky to be married
to such a powerful man.

20:13.496 --> 20:15.046
Okay, daddy.

20:15.098 --> 20:17.665
I have to go get ready
for the reunion.

20:17.684 --> 20:19.333
-Okay.
-All right, I love you.

20:19.352 --> 20:20.718
-I love you.
-[kisses]

20:20.770 --> 20:22.670
-all right.
-Okay.

20:22.689 --> 20:24.138
-See you later.

20:51.284 --> 20:52.283
Hey.

20:53.286 --> 20:54.986
I could really use a drink.

20:55.021 --> 20:56.287
-I'm on it.
-Okay.

21:00.076 --> 21:01.325
[sherri exclaims]

21:01.360 --> 21:05.029
[shouting] lola carmichael!

21:05.048 --> 21:07.715
I thought I saw you
in court today.

21:07.750 --> 21:09.700
Um, what firm
are you running in new york?

21:09.719 --> 21:11.552
Let me guess, cravath?

21:11.587 --> 21:14.338
I don't actively practice law.

21:14.373 --> 21:16.340
Oh.

21:16.375 --> 21:18.542
Well, maybe you should
ask ucla for your money back.

21:18.561 --> 21:20.261
[laughs] just kidding.

21:20.313 --> 21:21.729
Oh, god. I'm kidding.

21:21.764 --> 21:22.847
[both laugh]

21:22.882 --> 21:24.482
it's her. It's her.

21:25.318 --> 21:26.350
Sorry.

21:27.904 --> 21:29.854
[sighing] thank you.

21:29.889 --> 21:30.855

21:35.244 --> 21:38.529

21:38.564 --> 21:44.035
Oh, yes, a super famous person
is hosting tonight. [laughs]

21:44.070 --> 21:46.537
as you know, I am
sarita del castillo,

21:46.572 --> 21:48.956
and who would have thought
way back in law school

21:49.008 --> 21:50.424
that I would end up becoming

21:50.460 --> 21:53.127
an international
recording star

21:53.179 --> 21:57.414
and a two time
las vegas entertainer
of the year.

21:57.433 --> 21:58.716
[laughing]

21:58.751 --> 22:02.136
-ah, I see my girl,
sherri kansky.
-Oh, she knows my name.

22:02.188 --> 22:04.305
-[sara] still loving
those martinis girl.
-Yeah, I do.

22:04.357 --> 22:06.223
Yes. All right,

22:06.258 --> 22:08.726
let's get this party started!

22:08.761 --> 22:11.062
[all cheering]

22:17.537 --> 22:19.286
-[robin] here we are again.
-Hi.

22:20.206 --> 22:21.572
-How's it going?
-Hi.

22:21.607 --> 22:22.740
Hey.

22:24.827 --> 22:26.243
[clearing throat]

22:26.278 --> 22:28.662
lola, you are, uh,
rocking that dress.

22:28.715 --> 22:30.131
Oh, thanks.

22:30.166 --> 22:31.499
It's the spanks.

22:31.551 --> 22:32.750
[laughing] I can tell.

22:34.971 --> 22:36.971
You two were roommates
at howard, right?

22:37.006 --> 22:38.455
You know we were.

22:38.474 --> 22:39.473
-[lola] yeah.
-Yeah.

22:40.126 --> 22:42.626
Back when I was dating dré.

22:42.645 --> 22:45.129
We were all
just kids then, you know.

22:45.148 --> 22:46.981
[rachel] oh, yeah. [laughs]

22:47.016 --> 22:49.600
you know, I guess everything
happens for a reason.

22:50.353 --> 22:51.952
I guess.

22:51.988 --> 22:53.654
-[andré] you know what?
I think we're gonna go mingle.
-Yes.

22:53.689 --> 22:55.022
-So let's go mingle.
-[lola] okay.

22:55.074 --> 22:57.191
-Great idea.
-Yeah, mingle.

22:57.243 --> 22:58.993
-Um, nice to see you.
-[lola] sorry.

23:00.980 --> 23:02.163
-Yeah.
-Thank you

23:05.401 --> 23:07.618
[clears throat]
we're going this way.

23:10.640 --> 23:11.622
[luke clears throat]

23:13.826 --> 23:16.310
are you replacing
our weekly run
with a hot dog eating contest?

23:16.345 --> 23:17.845
[mark] I'm starving.

23:19.082 --> 23:21.882
Sarita, uh, mark callan.

23:23.436 --> 23:25.052
-We were in the same
section together.
-Mmm.

23:25.104 --> 23:26.554
I'm sorry, I have no idea
who you are.

23:27.690 --> 23:29.056
I meet so many people.

23:30.193 --> 23:31.308
It's exhausting.

23:36.849 --> 23:38.783
You don't ever
repeat this story.

23:39.786 --> 23:41.869
What! Emily,
are you kidding me?

23:41.904 --> 23:43.537
You're still tracking her
on your phone?

23:43.573 --> 23:46.574
Emily is driving downtown.
She promised to quit uber.

23:46.626 --> 23:48.325
[groans]

23:49.078 --> 23:51.662
hey, emily, call me back,

23:51.697 --> 23:54.031
and I knew you just
sent me to voicemail.

23:54.050 --> 23:56.050
You know, people hear tax law,
and they're like...

23:56.085 --> 23:57.835
[pretends to sleep]

23:57.870 --> 24:00.171
you know what I mean, right?

24:00.206 --> 24:01.872
So, uh, but listen, man.

24:01.891 --> 24:05.759
The federal tax code,
it's like a fine wine,
you know.

24:05.812 --> 24:08.562
It's smooth, with depth
and all this--

24:08.598 --> 24:10.681
interesting, I really need
to get back--

24:10.716 --> 24:13.601
hey, hey, you said you were
in music or something right?

24:13.653 --> 24:17.521
Have you ever considered
transferring your copyrights
into your trust, I mean...

24:17.556 --> 24:18.823
-No.
-Mmm.

24:19.775 --> 24:21.725
Do you mind
if I steal him away?

24:21.744 --> 24:26.614
Oh, sure, yeah. Uh,
I should probably figure out
who I'm going home with.

24:28.400 --> 24:29.667
Yeah, no, yeah, I'm ready.

24:31.504 --> 24:33.087
[both laugh]

24:33.789 --> 24:35.239
the walk.

24:35.258 --> 24:36.540
Do you know him?

24:36.575 --> 24:37.958
Not really.

24:38.010 --> 24:42.096
He was always sun bathing
in front of royce hall,

24:42.131 --> 24:43.264
I didn't complain.

24:46.435 --> 24:49.520
So, pretty crazy, huh?

24:50.273 --> 24:53.090
Us here?

24:53.109 --> 24:56.944
Maybe you would've been
serious about us
if it wasn't for your dad.

24:57.980 --> 24:58.979
I'm kidding.

24:59.482 --> 25:00.764
I'm kidding.

25:00.783 --> 25:01.866
Hey.

25:03.152 --> 25:04.285
Are you happy?

25:05.705 --> 25:07.621
Of... Of course.

25:09.959 --> 25:11.125
-Am I interrupting?
-Hey.

25:12.945 --> 25:13.994
No.

25:16.282 --> 25:17.548
Not at all.

25:19.051 --> 25:22.452
How are you crashing
my friend's reunion right now?

25:22.471 --> 25:25.306
Crash is right.
Thanks to your rage text,

25:25.341 --> 25:27.675
I almost rear ended
a smart car on figueroa.

25:27.727 --> 25:30.460
You are 36 weeks,
you should be at home,

25:30.479 --> 25:32.129
not driving for uber.

25:32.148 --> 25:33.597
I switched to e-drive now.

25:33.632 --> 25:37.268
Also, I know
my fucking body, okay?
Your baby is safe.

25:37.303 --> 25:40.104
-All right? Your baby is safe.
-I don' mean to be bold, um...

25:41.691 --> 25:43.991
...But I just can't take
my eyes off of you.

25:44.026 --> 25:47.444
I mean, you are glowing.

25:47.479 --> 25:49.479
You do realize
that I am fucking pregnant?

25:49.498 --> 25:51.949
Oh, do I ever.

25:51.984 --> 25:53.317
Wait, what?

25:53.336 --> 25:55.152
Oh, yes. Thank you so much.

25:55.171 --> 25:57.538
You cannot eat seafood!

25:57.590 --> 25:59.290
You are the worst
surrogate ever.

25:59.325 --> 26:01.008
Your child is gonna hate you.

26:01.043 --> 26:03.544
[lola] okay, okay.
What is with you two?

26:03.596 --> 26:06.830
Take a deep breath,
or someone's gonna end up
in contractions.

26:06.849 --> 26:08.849
He judges everything I do.

26:08.884 --> 26:11.385
I'm staying at the ritz,
you wanna get out of here?

26:11.437 --> 26:12.636
You know, we could
grab a bite.

26:12.671 --> 26:14.355
I could watch you eat for two.

26:14.390 --> 26:15.889
Are you hitting on
my surrogate?

26:15.942 --> 26:17.524
100%.

26:17.560 --> 26:19.676
[laughing] I mean,
look at her.

26:19.695 --> 26:21.061
-[luke exclaiming]
-wanna come with me?

26:21.113 --> 26:22.679
[lola] oh, oh, oh.

26:22.698 --> 26:23.897
Luke's a vasovagal.

26:23.950 --> 26:26.350
-The fuck?
-He faints when under
extreme stress.

26:26.369 --> 26:28.202
He needs to get outside
and get some fresh air.

26:28.237 --> 26:29.820
I got him. Come here.

26:30.573 --> 26:31.572
God, you're a diva.

26:33.025 --> 26:34.124
I think I found her.

26:36.879 --> 26:38.078
Judge benner?

26:39.465 --> 26:40.831
Hi.

26:40.866 --> 26:41.999
Lola carmichael.

26:42.034 --> 26:44.885
I observed one of your trials
when I was in law school.

26:44.920 --> 26:47.671
Wait! You're mark's lola?

26:47.706 --> 26:50.257
Mmm, he talked about you
all the time.

26:50.309 --> 26:51.642
Oh.

26:51.677 --> 26:54.678
Mmm. I'm here to present
judge callan an alumni
achievement award.

26:54.713 --> 26:56.063
He's getting an award.

26:56.098 --> 26:59.216
I was mark's mentor
here at the hoj.

26:59.235 --> 27:00.901
What made you step down
from the bench?

27:00.936 --> 27:02.069
[scoffs]

27:02.905 --> 27:06.523
this place is a nest
of vipers.

27:06.558 --> 27:10.277
The best thing I ever did
was to show those cowards

27:10.329 --> 27:13.563
my firm ass as I walked
out the door.

27:13.582 --> 27:14.948
[gurgling]

27:15.001 --> 27:16.583
mmm. Oh, my stomach.

27:17.953 --> 27:20.871
Oh. [sniffs] oh, no!

27:20.906 --> 27:21.922
Are you okay?

27:21.957 --> 27:23.707
Mmm. It's this damn shrimp!

27:23.742 --> 27:26.543
What was I thinking
eating event seafood?

27:26.578 --> 27:28.712
[sara over pa]
<i> if everyone could please come</i>
<i> to the stage area,</i>

27:28.747 --> 27:32.582
<i> we're about to start</i>
<i> the alumni awards</i>
<i> presentation!</i>

27:32.601 --> 27:34.751
Okay, here are my notes.

27:34.770 --> 27:36.970
Just remember
to punch the joke
about him being cheap.

27:37.023 --> 27:38.272
Wait, me?

27:38.307 --> 27:40.140
No, you need to find
someone else.

27:40.192 --> 27:42.309
No, you present the award.
No time!

27:42.361 --> 27:44.611
I need to hit
the bathroom fast!

27:54.073 --> 27:55.506
[emily] just like that, okay.

27:56.191 --> 27:57.374
-Better?
-[luke] yeah.

27:57.410 --> 27:58.492
[emily] good.

27:59.412 --> 28:00.544
I, um...

28:03.699 --> 28:06.050
-I'm sorry for being on you
all the time.
-Hmm.

28:07.470 --> 28:10.504
Look, maybe I have been
a little active lately.

28:10.539 --> 28:12.372
-[luke] mmm-hmm.
-So, you know,

28:12.391 --> 28:13.891
your anxiety
is understandable.

28:18.264 --> 28:19.346
You can touch it.

28:22.151 --> 28:23.901
Mmm.

28:24.937 --> 28:26.737
You're gonna be
a really great dad, luke.

28:27.723 --> 28:29.222
Probably a helicopter parent.

28:29.241 --> 28:32.225
[emily] definitely, but, like,
in the best way.

28:32.244 --> 28:34.244
And you're obviously
an amazing husband.

28:35.063 --> 28:37.498
Shit, too bad you're married.

28:40.569 --> 28:42.753
[voiceover on tv]<i> at ucla,</i>

28:42.788 --> 28:46.123
<i> judge callan served</i>
<i> as co-editor in chief</i>

28:46.158 --> 28:47.791
[lola] benner got
food poisoning,

-and asked me to step in...
-[voiceover on tv]<i> he was</i>

28:50.062 --> 28:52.129

28:52.965 --> 28:55.432
No. No, it's... That's fine.

28:59.972 --> 29:01.421
<i> He is the recipient</i>
<i> of the medal...</i>

29:01.440 --> 29:03.307
Oh, my god.
We were such dorks.

29:04.143 --> 29:06.393
Did you pick that picture?

29:06.428 --> 29:09.563
They had me send them
a bunch of photos from when
we were in law school.

29:10.950 --> 29:11.982
You were in most.

29:13.986 --> 29:15.452
You were my ride or die, lo.

29:16.522 --> 29:18.322
We were gonna take on
the world together.

29:19.708 --> 29:20.908
And then I left.

29:21.961 --> 29:24.495
It was hard for me to accept

29:25.548 --> 29:26.380
that you...

29:27.449 --> 29:29.917
Chose a different life.

29:29.952 --> 29:32.786
[sara] and now,
ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the stage,

29:32.805 --> 29:36.089
the honorable judge,
mark callan.

29:36.124 --> 29:37.441
-[audience applauds]
-[woman] all right.

29:37.476 --> 29:40.677
My old
section two<i> amigo,</i> apparently.

29:40.713 --> 29:42.513
-[audience applauding]
-[person] woo hoo!

29:44.150 --> 29:48.819
Now, to present
the alumni achievement award
this year,

29:49.805 --> 29:50.604
uh...

29:51.323 --> 29:52.606
[whispers] lola carmichael.

29:53.192 --> 29:55.959
...Lola king cola.

29:55.995 --> 29:57.444
[sherri cheers]

29:57.479 --> 29:59.312
lola, don't stop!

29:59.331 --> 30:00.164
[sherri cheers]

30:00.699 --> 30:01.648
[sara breathes in]

30:01.667 --> 30:02.699
here you are, dear.

30:02.751 --> 30:04.668
It's a rental,
so just be careful.

30:04.703 --> 30:06.537
-[woman] lola!
-[clears throat]

30:07.155 --> 30:08.321
[lola clears throat]

30:08.340 --> 30:09.506
[lola] okay.

30:10.259 --> 30:13.043
I am lola carmichael.

30:13.095 --> 30:16.213
It seems like just yesterday,
mark and I were first years

30:16.265 --> 30:21.652
having secret study meetings
in the back staircase
of the law library.

30:21.687 --> 30:26.256
Two young dreamers plotting
our future legal conquests.

30:28.527 --> 30:30.677
And for one of us,
that dream came true.

30:30.696 --> 30:31.895
[softly] lola.

30:36.785 --> 30:39.403
I could not
be more proud of my friend.

30:43.943 --> 30:48.812
It's easy to point out
all that's wrong
with our justice system.

30:48.847 --> 30:51.648
But what's hard
is staying in the fight,

30:51.684 --> 30:53.016
showing up every day.

30:54.353 --> 30:58.021
And you do that
with undivided commitment.

31:02.094 --> 31:02.926
So...

31:04.379 --> 31:08.932
It is with great admiration
that I present this year's

31:08.984 --> 31:13.036
alumni achievement award
to the honorable

31:13.072 --> 31:15.239
judge mark callan.

31:15.274 --> 31:17.658
[audience applauds]

31:29.455 --> 31:30.537
nice speech.

31:33.425 --> 31:34.341
Thanks.

31:35.427 --> 31:37.261
Mark always
deserved better than you.

31:38.347 --> 31:40.097
Also, stay away
from my husband.

31:40.132 --> 31:41.882
I am happily married.

31:41.917 --> 31:43.383
What is your problem with me?

31:44.436 --> 31:45.886
You know, you should
drop out of the election

31:45.921 --> 31:48.421
while you can still
spare yourself
the humiliation.

31:48.440 --> 31:52.142
I hail from four generations
of black society.

31:52.194 --> 31:56.429
You'll always just be lola
from inglewood.

31:56.448 --> 31:58.231
Little miss ghetto
wears prada.

31:58.934 --> 32:00.617
Are threatened by me, rachel?

32:00.653 --> 32:02.268
Not in the least.

32:02.288 --> 32:04.237
Then what is your problem?

32:04.272 --> 32:07.607
It's been 10 years.
Get over it!

32:07.626 --> 32:09.576
-You should have asked me.
-I did.

32:09.611 --> 32:12.129
You said it was fine.

32:12.164 --> 32:15.132
You had robin.
You had to go after dre too.

32:15.167 --> 32:16.633
You two were broken up!

32:16.669 --> 32:20.170
As my friend,
as my line sister,
you should have known better

32:20.222 --> 32:22.723
and checked in to see
if I was really okay with it.

32:26.845 --> 32:27.678
I get it.

32:30.049 --> 32:31.398
You're right. I'm sorry.

32:34.687 --> 32:36.186
Wanna do a shot?

32:37.656 --> 32:39.806
You know, I'm still
gonna have to whoop
your ass in the election.

32:39.825 --> 32:41.525
Right? Ms. Carmichael.

32:44.530 --> 32:47.447
-So tequila, straight up?
-Duh.

32:48.250 --> 32:49.082
[bartender] coming right up.

32:51.003 --> 32:53.503
[whispers] sarita. Sarita.
Sarita.

32:53.539 --> 32:54.871
-Oh, yes!
-[sherri] do you remember me?

32:54.923 --> 32:56.156
-Yes, I do!
-Sherri kansky.

32:56.175 --> 32:57.674

that mr. Rivera works
with free counsel initiative
