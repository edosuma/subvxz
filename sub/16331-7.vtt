WEBVTT

00:03.380 --> 00:05.914
(crickets chirping)

00:16.327 --> 00:18.961
This is gonna be so good.

00:18.963 --> 00:21.730
This is why I have 75 cameras in
the house recording everything.

00:21.732 --> 00:23.465
(door opens)

00:23.467 --> 00:25.801
Shelby. Hey.

00:25.803 --> 00:28.837
Come on, Matt,
do something.

00:28.839 --> 00:31.006
The guy (bleep)ed your wife
and rubbed it in your face

00:31.008 --> 00:32.641
in front of the entire country.

00:32.643 --> 00:35.644
SHELBY:
Matt, Matt, Matt! Matt!
(grunting)

00:35.646 --> 00:37.913
Hey! Matt!
(shouting)

00:37.915 --> 00:40.215
Get off him!

00:40.217 --> 00:44.887
Yes! Who in America is not
coming back after they see that?
(indistinct shouting)

00:44.889 --> 00:47.489
(door opens)
ALISSA:
Hey. Dinner.

00:48.492 --> 00:50.826
Sid...

00:50.828 --> 00:53.996
Thank you.
Okay, okay. Here.

00:53.998 --> 00:56.198
Uh, I asked for a salad.

00:56.200 --> 00:58.200
(chuckles) Yeah, well,
we're in North Carolina.

00:58.202 --> 01:01.403
If it's not breaded and fried,
it's not edible.

01:02.740 --> 01:04.406
Hey, Sid, have you talked
to Diana?

01:04.408 --> 01:06.375
I've been calling her all day,
and she hasn't answered.

01:06.377 --> 01:08.710
Is she coming back?
We don't need Diana.

01:08.712 --> 01:11.246
I'm not wasting my energy
on someone who doesn't want

01:11.248 --> 01:13.048
to be a part of history.

01:13.050 --> 01:14.583
Okay.

01:27.531 --> 01:30.032
(grunting onscreen)

01:31.769 --> 01:33.535
Whoa. Did you
just see that?

01:33.537 --> 01:34.803
See what?

01:34.805 --> 01:38.106
Somebody
just stabbed Rory.

01:38.108 --> 01:40.609
Very funny.
No, I swear.

01:41.779 --> 01:44.313
Let's-let's rewind it.

01:44.315 --> 01:46.848
(screaming in distance)

01:48.919 --> 01:50.886
Alissa?

01:50.888 --> 01:53.555
You okay?

02:00.497 --> 02:02.597
Alissa?

02:02.599 --> 02:04.866
(gurgling)

02:07.805 --> 02:11.673
(rustling)
Shit. Shit. Get the camera.

02:11.675 --> 02:13.675
Get the camera. Get the camera!

02:13.677 --> 02:16.778
(gurgling, coughing)
Oh, shit.

02:16.780 --> 02:19.181
Oh, my God.
Oh, God.

02:19.183 --> 02:21.483
Oh, God. Oh, shit.
Holy shit.

02:21.485 --> 02:23.785
Oh, (bleep).
(bleep).

02:23.787 --> 02:26.788
Oh, shit.
(shouts)

02:26.790 --> 02:28.790
(grunting)

02:28.792 --> 02:31.026
Sidney? Sidney, are you okay?

02:31.028 --> 02:32.961
Holy shit. Oh, shit.

02:32.963 --> 02:34.930
Oh, shit, oh, shit, oh, shit.

02:34.932 --> 02:38.000
(panting, grunts)
(stabbing sound)

02:38.002 --> 02:40.869
(screaming)
(stabbing sounds)

02:48.445 --> 02:53.415
I am the tree and
the lightning that strikes it.

03:03.327 --> 03:06.361
Rory?

03:12.870 --> 03:15.303
Rory?

03:16.306 --> 03:19.274
Rory!

03:28.852 --> 03:31.920
He's not upstairs.

03:31.922 --> 03:34.923
MATT:
I told you.

03:34.925 --> 03:36.091
"R" is for Rory.
Could you

03:36.093 --> 03:38.660
stop scaring her?
He is her husband.

03:38.662 --> 03:41.696
Now, if you so spooked,
why you come back anyway?

03:41.698 --> 03:44.566
I thought
I could be happy here.

03:44.568 --> 03:46.868
Do you think
he could be hiding from us?

03:46.870 --> 03:49.237
Did you look
under the beds?

03:49.239 --> 03:52.574
In the closets?

03:56.080 --> 03:59.414
We'll start looking over here.

03:59.416 --> 04:03.018
Okay. I'll check in here.

04:03.020 --> 04:05.353
Any minute now, we're gonna
hear somebody scream.

04:05.355 --> 04:07.889
Don't be such a ghoul, Matt.

04:07.891 --> 04:09.925
AUDREY:
<i> Are you going to stick</i>

04:09.927 --> 04:11.927
that thing in my face
the entire time we're here?

04:11.929 --> 04:14.129
LEE: Hell yes.
But not just you.

04:14.131 --> 04:16.965
I'm filming the whole thing.
But they've installed cameras
all over the house.

04:16.967 --> 04:18.300
That they control.

04:18.302 --> 04:19.768
And edit
to tell their story.

04:19.770 --> 04:21.570
This camera is my story.

04:21.572 --> 04:23.572
People are going to know
I did not lie.

04:23.574 --> 04:26.875
DOMINIC: Guys? You better
come in here and see this.

04:29.980 --> 04:31.313
Is it blood?

04:31.315 --> 04:32.614
I've done my share

04:32.616 --> 04:34.749
of slasher films.

04:34.751 --> 04:37.752
That don't smell
like corn syrup.

04:37.754 --> 04:41.089
Well, if it's his blood,
where's the body?

04:41.091 --> 04:44.759
Oh, my God.

04:44.761 --> 04:46.962
Oh, my God. Brad Pitt.

04:46.964 --> 04:48.497
DOMINIC:
What?

04:48.499 --> 04:50.632
Rory got a better offer.

04:50.634 --> 04:52.400
He's left us to
go back to L.A.

04:52.402 --> 04:54.436
for a movie. Sidney
put him up to this

04:54.438 --> 04:56.972
to give us a good
scare for the camera!

04:56.974 --> 04:59.241
You are an asshole, Sidney!

04:59.243 --> 05:02.511
Well, it didn't work,
because I'm onto you!

05:02.513 --> 05:07.015
I was batshit crazy
to think it could work.

05:07.017 --> 05:11.820
He always said
age is just a number.

05:11.822 --> 05:14.089
But I knew better.

05:14.091 --> 05:18.460
It's nothing for a man to be
15 years older than his bride.

05:18.462 --> 05:20.862
But for a woman...

05:20.864 --> 05:22.964
it's Mount Everest.

05:22.966 --> 05:28.703
All the conditions have
to be perfect for the ascent.

05:28.705 --> 05:32.007
And I guess
he just ran out of oxygen.

05:32.009 --> 05:34.576
(crying softly)

05:35.879 --> 05:37.879
(as Thomasin):
Damn,

05:37.881 --> 05:39.848
treacherous,

05:39.850 --> 05:43.852
despicable serpent.

05:43.854 --> 05:47.856
Hurling wicked insults
at mine every turn.

05:47.858 --> 05:49.324
(sniffles)

05:49.326 --> 05:53.461
He should not
have cast me aside so.

05:53.463 --> 05:55.797
He deserves to roast

05:55.799 --> 05:58.733
for an eternity
in the flaming depths

05:58.735 --> 06:02.737
of all this blood.

06:10.514 --> 06:13.515
(normal voice):
She had a baby.

06:13.517 --> 06:15.517
(exhales)
God.

06:15.519 --> 06:17.319
(sucks air through teeth)

06:17.321 --> 06:20.889
Alissa had a baby.

06:20.891 --> 06:24.159
(sighs)

06:24.161 --> 06:25.860
I liked her.

06:25.862 --> 06:29.831
She always made sure I had
a cooling tent when it was hot.

06:31.335 --> 06:33.001
Oh, God.

06:33.003 --> 06:35.403
What have I done?

06:35.405 --> 06:37.906
(shuddering breath)

06:37.908 --> 06:41.409
I robbed that baby of a mother.

06:43.914 --> 06:46.448
(as Thomasin):
They cheated me of my land.

06:46.450 --> 06:49.251
Robbed me of my dignity.

06:49.253 --> 06:51.753
All the vipers were one
and the same.

06:51.755 --> 06:53.922
They all had to die.

06:53.924 --> 06:56.291
Their bloody carcasses
will slake the thirst

06:56.293 --> 06:58.093
of the ancient gods.
(sniffles)

06:58.095 --> 07:00.161
Preserve my legacy.

07:01.231 --> 07:04.766
(sniffling)

07:04.768 --> 07:07.869
(normal voice):
It was my destiny.

07:07.871 --> 07:10.805
They chose me.

07:10.807 --> 07:14.075
I was the fan favorite.

07:14.077 --> 07:16.211
(sniffles)

07:16.213 --> 07:20.815
All my life,
people have underestimated me.

07:20.817 --> 07:24.152
They only booked me
for three episodes,

07:24.154 --> 07:27.055
but I got five.

07:27.057 --> 07:30.458
'Cause the fans wanted more.

07:30.460 --> 07:33.528
They wanted The Butcher.

07:35.465 --> 07:38.466
<i> Am an ri'ain</i>

07:38.468 --> 07:40.769
<i> gach uile choirceoige.</i>

07:40.771 --> 07:43.772
(Celtic whispers in distance)

07:43.774 --> 07:45.807
Is somebody there?

07:45.809 --> 07:47.809
(Celtic continues)
(grunts)

07:47.811 --> 07:50.278
(whimpers)

07:50.280 --> 07:52.814
Is somebody there?

07:52.816 --> 07:56.351
(lighter flicking)

07:56.353 --> 07:58.787
(gasps)

07:58.789 --> 08:01.189
(screaming)

08:06.129 --> 08:07.929
(sucks air through teeth)

08:07.931 --> 08:10.965
Whew.

08:10.967 --> 08:14.202
Something just don't feel right
about this.

08:14.204 --> 08:16.938
Then now's definitely not
the time to get loaded.

08:16.940 --> 08:19.774
It's 6:00 a.m.
Leave her alone.

08:19.776 --> 08:24.679
Hell, we could all use
a drink after last night.

08:24.681 --> 08:26.681
Or two.
(chuckles)

08:26.683 --> 08:29.017
Or ten. May I?

08:31.121 --> 08:33.121
No one ever goes to
their grave regretting

08:33.123 --> 08:34.656
they had too much fun.

08:34.658 --> 08:35.857
Do you even know
what you're doing?

08:35.859 --> 08:37.492
You're helping
an alcoholic drink.

08:37.494 --> 08:41.029
That's like handing a
killer a loaded gun.

08:41.031 --> 08:43.998
Yeah, well, I guess
you'd be the expert

08:44.000 --> 08:46.368
on that one.
(chuckles)

08:54.311 --> 08:55.844
Can't avoid me

08:55.846 --> 08:58.847
forever, Shelb.
I can and I will.

08:58.849 --> 09:01.416
You never should have
come back here.

09:01.418 --> 09:03.451
Of course
I should have come back.

09:04.521 --> 09:07.522
You know I had to see you again.

09:07.524 --> 09:09.023
Yeah, well,
I don't want to see you.
(scoffs)

09:09.025 --> 09:10.358
I love my husband.

09:10.360 --> 09:12.160
I'm here for him.

09:12.162 --> 09:15.864
Yeah. Well,
he ain't here for you.

09:15.866 --> 09:17.932
But I am.

09:17.934 --> 09:19.834
Come on, Shelb.

09:19.836 --> 09:24.539
He never touched you
the way I touched you.

09:24.541 --> 09:26.508
That weekend. Remember?
Stop it.

09:26.510 --> 09:29.844
I know you do.

09:29.846 --> 09:31.346
I can tell
because you're shivering.

09:31.348 --> 09:32.747
I am not shivering.

09:32.749 --> 09:34.082
I am vibrating

09:34.084 --> 09:38.420
with rage,
you asshole.

09:38.422 --> 09:39.854
(door shuts)

09:39.856 --> 09:41.756
Hey, bro.

09:41.758 --> 09:43.758
Oh, God...

09:43.760 --> 09:45.794
You want her?

09:45.796 --> 09:49.764
You can have her. I don't give
a shit what you do with her.

09:49.766 --> 09:51.966
(bleep) her right here,
for all I care.

09:51.968 --> 09:55.370
Ooh.
Just stay out of my way.

09:55.372 --> 09:57.372
(scoffs)

09:57.374 --> 10:00.008
(chuckling):
Wow.

10:06.216 --> 10:09.751
You know what I love
about reality TV the most?

10:09.753 --> 10:11.286
The bad guy.

10:11.288 --> 10:12.720
Puck. Omarosa.

10:12.722 --> 10:14.722
That crazy bitch
with the fake leg.

10:14.724 --> 10:16.391
Yeah, I did my homework.

10:16.393 --> 10:18.493
Sure, I care about Shelby.

10:18.495 --> 10:20.795
I mean, she is fine.

10:20.797 --> 10:23.498
But Sidney paid me to come back
for one reason

10:23.500 --> 10:26.234
and one reason only: ratings.

10:27.838 --> 10:30.138
You see this?

10:30.140 --> 10:32.340
Check this out.

10:32.342 --> 10:34.909
Mmm.

10:37.013 --> 10:41.583
Sid's got me wired and ready
to ruin these people's lives

10:41.585 --> 10:43.852
and record every moment of it.

10:43.854 --> 10:45.653
Body cam.

10:45.655 --> 10:48.323
Up close and personal. Booyah.

10:48.325 --> 10:50.325
(chuckles)

10:50.327 --> 10:51.960
Hey, listen,

10:51.962 --> 10:53.628
if I got to play the dick

10:53.630 --> 10:55.930
in order for people to tune in
for ratings,

10:55.932 --> 10:57.765
then that's what the hell
I'm-a do.

10:57.767 --> 10:59.000
What's the bright side?

10:59.002 --> 11:00.869
Let me tell you
what the bright side is.

11:00.871 --> 11:03.872
The bad guy is always the lead
on every show.

11:03.874 --> 11:05.807
Now, let me ask you
something else,

11:05.809 --> 11:07.709
judgmental mother(bleep)ers,

11:07.711 --> 11:10.912
what's more important
than screen time, huh?

11:13.283 --> 11:15.783
(door opens)

11:27.797 --> 11:30.365
(crying)

12:00.497 --> 12:02.897
(as Thomasin):
Trespasser.
(gasps)

12:02.899 --> 12:04.832
This land

12:04.834 --> 12:06.868
belongeth to my people.

12:06.870 --> 12:09.504
Thou art not welcome.

12:09.506 --> 12:13.241
Now punishment
will be thy death.

12:13.243 --> 12:15.577
Agnes...

12:18.081 --> 12:20.548
(normal voice):
I just wanted to be on the show.

12:20.550 --> 12:23.351
But he won't
let me.

12:23.353 --> 12:25.353
He said

12:25.355 --> 12:27.922
no one cares about me anymore.

12:27.924 --> 12:29.891
Put the
knife down.

12:29.893 --> 12:31.893
Please, Agnes.

12:31.895 --> 12:33.394
(as Thomasin):
I'm The Butcher,

12:33.396 --> 12:37.198
and all that threaten
and invade my land

12:37.200 --> 12:39.300
do me harm.
Thou dare

12:39.302 --> 12:41.102
come back here?

12:41.104 --> 12:44.272
Hast thou learned nothing,
Shelby Miller?

12:44.874 --> 12:47.442
(screaming)

12:48.912 --> 12:51.212
(sobbing, shouting)

12:56.920 --> 12:58.920
What art thou doing?

12:58.922 --> 13:01.756
I know that I'm about to die.

13:01.758 --> 13:04.058
And I want the world
to know exactly

13:04.060 --> 13:06.894
who was responsible
for my murder.

13:06.896 --> 13:09.063
<i> Fola a fuil, saol a bas.</i>

13:09.065 --> 13:11.065
<i> Olc na dorchdais.</i>

13:11.067 --> 13:13.735
<i> Cuirimid iobairt.</i>

13:13.737 --> 13:14.569
(shouts)

13:14.571 --> 13:16.070
Swine!

13:16.072 --> 13:20.608
I shall wear thy scalp
as an animal pelt!

13:20.610 --> 13:22.910
(grunting)

13:29.486 --> 13:33.054
(whimpers)
(panting) Okay.

13:34.758 --> 13:36.324
(sobbing)

13:39.596 --> 13:42.830
Oh, come on.
Oh, come on, girl.

13:42.832 --> 13:44.832
Come on, I got you,
I got you.

13:44.834 --> 13:47.435
(sobbing, moaning)

13:50.373 --> 13:53.841
DOMINIC:
Where the (bleep) is Agnes?

13:53.843 --> 13:57.111
(panting)
(sobbing)

14:08.124 --> 14:10.358
Oh, God. Quickly, quickly.
I need the bandages.

14:10.360 --> 14:13.661
Quickly. Come on, darling.
Tr-Try to stay awake.

14:13.663 --> 14:15.029
Oh, Jesus. Here,
give me that.

14:15.031 --> 14:17.198
I-I can help.
Now you want to help?

14:17.200 --> 14:19.400
Where were you when Agnes
was here with the knife?

14:19.402 --> 14:21.502
Boys, seriously! Come on.

14:21.504 --> 14:23.838
Okay. Keep her
head up. Come on.

14:23.840 --> 14:27.408
Wrap it around. There we go.
Try to keep it really tight.

14:27.410 --> 14:28.810
Once across her
chest. Come on.

14:28.812 --> 14:31.412
Open up, darling. Okay.

14:31.414 --> 14:34.015
It's working.
I was a nurse
at Her Majesty's.

14:34.017 --> 14:38.086
Hospital?
No, darling. The theatre
in the West End.

14:38.088 --> 14:41.489
None of the phones work.
Somebody cut the lines.

14:41.491 --> 14:44.859
Hey, hey...
Sidney, Shelby is really hurt.

14:44.861 --> 14:46.861
You need to send
a (bleep)ing ambulance

14:46.863 --> 14:48.830
to the house right now!

14:48.832 --> 14:51.099
It's been an hour.

14:51.101 --> 14:52.934
No ambulance.

14:52.936 --> 14:55.503
No message from Sidney.

14:55.505 --> 14:59.941
Shelby, she seems to be stable.

14:59.943 --> 15:02.410
For now.

15:04.114 --> 15:06.414
I'm really struggling here.

15:06.416 --> 15:08.349
I'll admit it,

15:08.351 --> 15:10.551
I'm scared.

15:10.553 --> 15:12.620
The production trailer
can't be too far away.

15:12.622 --> 15:14.956
So it shouldn't be hard
for you to find them...

15:14.958 --> 15:15.957
Me?
Yeah.

15:15.959 --> 15:17.592
I-I'm not leaving Shelby's side.

15:17.594 --> 15:19.761
If you think I'm going outside,
getting lost in them woods,

15:19.763 --> 15:21.896
while there's some crazy
old lady running around
with a cleaver, you can kiss

15:21.898 --> 15:23.297
your own ass...
This is bullshit!

15:23.299 --> 15:25.967
Matt, you stay with
Shelby. I'll go.

15:25.969 --> 15:28.035
Not by yourself,
you won't.
I-I'll go with her!

15:28.037 --> 15:30.805
Not sure I even trust you
to come back with help.

15:30.807 --> 15:32.306
You can trust this.
AUDREY:
Oh, my God.

15:32.308 --> 15:33.608
MONET:
You done brought

15:33.610 --> 15:35.910
a gun in here?!
You bet your ass I did.

15:35.912 --> 15:37.912
You think I'd come
back here defenseless?

15:37.914 --> 15:40.081
She's probably
watching us right now.
(opens chamber)

15:40.083 --> 15:42.817
If I see her first,
I'll shoot on sight.
Look,

15:42.819 --> 15:44.819
I know this goes against
every fiber of your being,

15:44.821 --> 15:47.221
but could you please try
to avoid bloodshed?

15:47.223 --> 15:50.725
There is a secret way
out of this house.

15:50.727 --> 15:52.894
All right, mind
your heads.

15:52.896 --> 15:54.896
Should we really be down here?

15:54.898 --> 15:56.731
LEE:
This is the best way.

15:56.733 --> 15:59.734
No one watching the house
will know we've gone.

15:59.736 --> 16:02.837
MONET:
Are you sure about that?

16:02.839 --> 16:06.007
Oh, that (bleep)ing Sidney
doesn't miss a beat, does he?

16:06.009 --> 16:09.410
Son of a bitch wants everything
on camera?

16:09.412 --> 16:12.280
When I see him, I'm-a put
my foot so far up his ass

16:12.282 --> 16:14.749
I'm-a knock his teeth out.

16:25.495 --> 16:28.629
I'm gonna get everything. Use it
as proof when I sue their asses.

16:28.631 --> 16:30.832
AUDREY:
I can't believe that Agnes.

16:30.834 --> 16:33.301
I knew she was upset
about losing the Saturn Award,

16:33.303 --> 16:35.937
but I didn't think it would
make her completely homicidal.
(distant bellow)

16:35.939 --> 16:38.472
(quietly):
Quiet, both of you.

16:38.474 --> 16:41.876
Do you hear that?

16:43.813 --> 16:46.614
(low growl)

16:46.616 --> 16:48.616
Darling?

16:48.618 --> 16:50.985
Oh, my God.

16:50.987 --> 16:52.887
Rory?

16:52.889 --> 16:55.256
Is that you?

16:56.860 --> 16:59.961
(roaring)

16:59.963 --> 17:02.530
Get behind me.

17:02.532 --> 17:03.965
(screaming)

17:03.967 --> 17:07.735
Oh, my God!
(gasping)
MONET: What was that?!

17:07.737 --> 17:09.737
(roars)

17:09.739 --> 17:11.239
Oh, my God!

17:11.241 --> 17:13.307
(roaring)
Run!

17:13.309 --> 17:16.744
(screaming)

17:16.746 --> 17:18.546
(panting)
Holy shit.

17:18.548 --> 17:19.881
Oh, my God!

17:19.883 --> 17:21.148
What the hell was that thing?!

17:21.150 --> 17:24.685
(panting)
I saw you shoot it
four times

17:24.687 --> 17:26.687
with my own eyes!
(panting)

17:26.689 --> 17:28.890
Will it follow us?
I don't think so.

17:28.892 --> 17:30.892
Matt thinks it prefers
the tunnel.

17:30.894 --> 17:32.760
What? You knew that thing
was down there?!

17:32.762 --> 17:35.496
How many times do we have
to tell you this is real?!

17:35.498 --> 17:37.398
Do you believe us now?

17:37.400 --> 17:40.768
Or do you want to deny what
you've seen with your own eyes?

17:40.770 --> 17:42.837
We have
to find Sidney.

17:42.839 --> 17:44.572
(panting)

17:44.574 --> 17:47.275
Let's go this way.
Come on.

17:47.277 --> 17:50.811
MONET: Oh, shit.
Lee, let's go.

17:56.753 --> 17:59.353
Here, take this.

18:00.290 --> 18:03.024
For the pain.

18:12.969 --> 18:16.570
You know...

18:16.572 --> 18:18.973
I really did love you.

18:18.975 --> 18:21.075
And I ruined it.

18:21.077 --> 18:25.413
In one drunken,
pathetic weekend, Matt.

18:25.415 --> 18:27.381
I was so out
of my mind.

18:27.383 --> 18:29.383
Our marriage was over the day
we moved into this house.

18:29.385 --> 18:32.386
This place took something
from me. I-I...

18:32.388 --> 18:35.823
I haven't felt human
for two years, Shelby.

18:35.825 --> 18:37.892
I-I'm stuck.

18:37.894 --> 18:40.895
Still wandering lost
in these woods.

18:40.897 --> 18:43.664
You-you think I wanted
to come back here?

18:43.666 --> 18:47.034
I didn't have a choice.

18:50.273 --> 18:54.809
We both lost
something here.

18:54.811 --> 18:58.779
But we can get it back.

18:58.781 --> 19:01.048
(rustling)

19:04.587 --> 19:09.256
Where the (bleep)
is that trailer supposed to be?

19:09.258 --> 19:11.892
We are running out of daylight.

19:12.929 --> 19:16.430
Lee, isn't that the blood moon?

19:16.432 --> 19:18.933
Do you think we should try
and get back to the house now?

19:18.935 --> 19:20.768
Goddamn it.

19:20.770 --> 19:22.136
Shelby needs our help.

19:22.138 --> 19:23.838
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait a minute.

19:23.840 --> 19:25.840
You wanted us to believe you,
right?

19:25.842 --> 19:28.042
Didn't you say the blood moon
means that some bad shit

19:28.044 --> 19:30.011
is about to happen?
So should we really be

19:30.013 --> 19:32.013
out here in the open like this

19:32.015 --> 19:34.448
with that up in the sky?
If we don't find

19:34.450 --> 19:36.817
the trailer,
we need to push to town.
The town

19:36.819 --> 19:37.885
is five miles away.

19:38.955 --> 19:40.388
But come on.

19:42.859 --> 19:43.991
Sidney!

19:43.993 --> 19:45.793
Sidney!
AUDREY: Goddamn it!

19:45.795 --> 19:47.361
Sidney.
Shit, your ass gonna get it!

19:47.363 --> 19:50.398
(gasping)
LEE:
Godda... Oh, my God!

19:50.400 --> 19:52.466
Oh, my God!
(gasping)

19:52.468 --> 19:54.468
AUDREY: Oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God.
(Monet groaning)

19:54.470 --> 19:55.836
Oh, Jesus, Sidney.

19:55.838 --> 19:57.805
I think he's dead.
You think?

19:57.807 --> 20:00.074
AUDREY: Oh, leave me alone!
I'm not American!

20:00.076 --> 20:02.910
I'm not used
to all this carnage!

20:02.912 --> 20:06.680
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

20:06.682 --> 20:09.350
What in God's name
are you doing?!

20:09.352 --> 20:11.685
Do you want
to get help or not?

20:11.687 --> 20:12.887
Oh, my God.
Find a phone!

20:12.889 --> 20:15.489
Oh, my God.

20:15.491 --> 20:17.725
Oh, my God. Oh, God, oh, God.

20:17.727 --> 20:20.528
Oh, God, oh, God.

20:20.530 --> 20:22.730
Oh, God.

20:22.732 --> 20:24.932
Oh, come on, come on, come on.

20:24.934 --> 20:27.501
Oh, come on. Goddamn it!

20:27.503 --> 20:29.236
Come on, come on!

20:29.238 --> 20:31.272
No phone. Not a laptop.
Oh, come on.

20:31.274 --> 20:33.274
Not a goddamn thing!
Come on!

20:33.276 --> 20:35.709
What about the car?
The car is completely dead.

20:35.711 --> 20:38.279
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
(panting)

20:38.281 --> 20:40.414
Oh, my God.
We have to get out of here.

20:40.416 --> 20:42.516
Well, where are we
supposed to go?
I don't know.

20:42.518 --> 20:45.286
We're in the middle of
goddamn (bleep) nowhere!

20:45.288 --> 20:48.923
Shit!
Oh, my God.
(panting)

20:58.234 --> 20:59.900
Oh, my God! It's Agnes!
(shrieking)

20:59.902 --> 21:01.135
Oh, my God!

21:01.137 --> 21:03.137
(screaming)

21:03.139 --> 21:04.538
Oh, my God.

21:04.540 --> 21:06.807
Oh, my God.

21:06.809 --> 21:10.044
Run! Run!
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

21:12.215 --> 21:14.548
MONET:
We're not gonna make it to town.

21:14.550 --> 21:17.084
And I'm not comfortable being
out here with that thing

21:17.086 --> 21:18.385
hanging over our heads.

21:18.387 --> 21:20.554
LEE:
Stop talking like that.

21:20.556 --> 21:22.623
We should turn back.

21:22.625 --> 21:23.991
We should.

21:26.229 --> 21:28.562
Look...
AUDREY: She's right...

21:28.564 --> 21:30.598
I know we're all a little
strung out right now,

21:30.600 --> 21:33.934
but we can't give up,
we can't.

21:33.936 --> 21:36.504
What is that?

21:40.143 --> 21:41.308
MONET:
Is that help?

21:41.310 --> 21:43.410
Get off the road... now!

21:43.412 --> 21:47.515
(panting, gasping)

21:56.926 --> 21:59.627
AUDREY: I think we lost them.
We should stop here.

21:59.629 --> 22:02.963
Rory...

22:02.965 --> 22:07.001
if you find this...

22:07.003 --> 22:12.173
know you gave me the best months
of my life.

22:12.175 --> 22:16.810
I'd never known love
until I met you...

22:16.812 --> 22:20.714
and I will always be grateful
for that.

22:20.716 --> 22:22.316
And I love you.

22:22.318 --> 22:26.620
I hope you find...
I hope you find this.

22:26.622 --> 22:28.956
MONET: Audrey?
Audrey!
What?

22:28.958 --> 22:31.692
What?
You're bleeding!

22:31.694 --> 22:33.894
Are you hurt?

22:33.896 --> 22:35.095
(whimpers)

22:39.835 --> 22:42.770
(both screaming)

22:53.683 --> 22:54.748
AUDREY (whimpering):
Oh my God.

22:54.750 --> 22:56.850
(sobbing)

22:56.852 --> 22:59.820
My baby, what did they
do to you?

22:59.822 --> 23:01.355
LEE:
Turn your camera on.

23:01.357 --> 23:03.257
MONET:
What? I'm not filming this,

23:03.259 --> 23:04.925
you psychopath!

23:04.927 --> 23:06.493
LEE:
People need to see.
(Audrey sobbing)

23:06.495 --> 23:08.362
That's her husband,
for Christ's sake!

23:08.364 --> 23:10.731
LEE:
Turn your goddamn camera on.

23:10.733 --> 23:12.733
(sobbing)

23:12.735 --> 23:13.834
(sighs)
(camera beeps)

23:16.405 --> 23:17.538
MONET:
Oh God!

23:17.540 --> 23:20.341
They found us!

23:20.343 --> 23:22.876
MONET:
Audrey! Audrey! Audrey.

23:22.878 --> 23:25.179
LEE:
Shit... hide!

23:25.181 --> 23:26.914
MONET: What-what-what-what-
what is it?

23:26.916 --> 23:29.083
Go!

23:29.085 --> 23:32.886
LEE: Honey, I know it's awful,
but we gotta get out of here,

23:32.888 --> 23:34.255
right now!

23:34.257 --> 23:35.389
I don't want to live!
Leave me...

23:35.391 --> 23:37.191
LEE: Come!

23:37.193 --> 23:39.994
(sobbing, mumbling)

23:54.076 --> 23:56.977
ISHMAEL:
Takin' pictures, little lady?

23:56.979 --> 23:58.312
(electric zapping)

23:58.314 --> 24:00.447
(zapping)
(Lee screams)

24:00.449 --> 24:03.284
(Monet whimpering)

24:06.255 --> 24:07.821
(Monet screams)

24:07.823 --> 24:11.625
(as Thomasin):
The fire will purify
my body...

24:11.627 --> 24:12.760
(sniffs)

24:12.762 --> 24:15.195
...and vanquish
the fear in my heart.

24:18.467 --> 24:20.267
(gasps, breathing heavily)

24:20.269 --> 24:22.936
(whimpering)

24:22.938 --> 24:24.905
(sobs)

24:28.344 --> 24:29.877
Agh...

24:32.848 --> 24:36.250
(flesh sizzles)
(screams)

24:36.986 --> 24:38.719
(screams)

24:40.856 --> 24:42.523
(grunts)

24:42.525 --> 24:45.192
Ahh... ah!

24:45.194 --> 24:46.960
Ah!

24:46.962 --> 24:49.229
(sobbing)

24:51.367 --> 24:52.866
(gasps)

24:54.537 --> 24:57.771
I've been imbued...

24:57.773 --> 25:00.441
with the power
of the blood moon!

25:00.443 --> 25:04.311
The land shall be
consecrated with blood,

25:04.313 --> 25:06.714
and purifed with flames!

25:06.716 --> 25:09.683
This house and everything in it

25:09.685 --> 25:13.654
will be consumed by fire!

25:13.656 --> 25:17.624
Only ashes will remain
at the end of this night.

25:20.863 --> 25:22.930
(faint, ghostly whispering)

25:48.724 --> 25:50.791
(stairs creaking)

26:10.579 --> 26:12.413
(door latch clicks)

26:22.925 --> 26:25.859
(rapid footsteps)

26:32.368 --> 26:34.768
MATT:
I've been waiting for you.

26:34.770 --> 26:38.806
(creature moaning, snarling)

26:44.780 --> 26:46.914
Shelby...

26:46.916 --> 26:48.749
Shelby, Shelby, wake up.

26:48.751 --> 26:50.717
Wake up, Shelby.
Come on.

26:50.719 --> 26:52.619
Come on, you gotta
come with me.

26:52.621 --> 26:54.154
You gotta come with me.
Come on, Shelby.

26:54.156 --> 26:56.023
I need you to come with me.

27:10.840 --> 27:13.707
(distant moaning)

27:17.079 --> 27:20.080
(male and female moaning)

27:23.285 --> 27:26.186
(inhuman shrieking)

27:29.492 --> 27:31.358
Get off him.

27:31.360 --> 27:35.095
Get off him!
Get off him!

27:35.097 --> 27:36.263
Get off him!

27:36.265 --> 27:37.297
(inhuman wail)

27:37.299 --> 27:38.832
Matt, Matt,

27:38.834 --> 27:40.834
we have to get
out of here.

27:40.836 --> 27:42.803
We should go.
I came back for her!

27:42.805 --> 27:44.838
What?

27:44.840 --> 27:46.673
I'm in love
with her, Shelby.

27:46.675 --> 27:49.276
She's the reason
I came back.

27:51.847 --> 27:53.547
(Matt grunts, Shelby screaming)

28:10.165 --> 28:11.932
(sobbing, screaming)

28:22.811 --> 28:26.813
(grunting)

28:26.815 --> 28:29.249
Why is he filming this?

28:29.251 --> 28:30.551
Are you working for Sidney?

28:30.553 --> 28:32.719
(laughter)
ISHMAEL:
Working?

28:32.721 --> 28:34.755
He ain't done a day's
work in his life.

28:34.757 --> 28:37.591
'Les you count sortin' buds
for creeper weed.

28:37.593 --> 28:40.861
Oh, that boy,
he got a nose for it.

28:40.863 --> 28:43.897
He only good for two things,
weed and...

28:43.899 --> 28:44.932
Taking pictures.

28:44.934 --> 28:46.900
(laughter)

28:46.902 --> 28:48.769
I have money.

28:48.771 --> 28:52.573
I can make life so
much easier for you all.

28:52.575 --> 28:56.843
We like our life
just the way it is.

28:56.845 --> 29:01.582
Make plenty of money
with our crop.

29:01.584 --> 29:03.784
Polks is part of the forest.

29:03.786 --> 29:06.587
Live off the land.

29:06.589 --> 29:08.755
Keep to our own.

29:08.757 --> 29:14.194
Never got help or
wanted help from nobody.

29:14.196 --> 29:19.066
Even the law knows better
than to bother with us.

29:19.068 --> 29:23.770
Going all the way back
150 years now.

29:23.772 --> 29:25.439
(sighs)

29:25.441 --> 29:27.641
Cut them off.

29:27.643 --> 29:29.810
Please don't.

29:29.812 --> 29:32.579
Please don't, please don't.
MAMA POLK:
Hold still, hold still.

29:32.581 --> 29:35.415
Just tear it.
Tear it, tear it off.
(snipping and tearing)

29:35.417 --> 29:36.750
P-pull it off.

29:36.752 --> 29:38.952
Hey, hey, ah, ah, ah!

29:38.954 --> 29:40.887
MAMA POLK:
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

29:40.889 --> 29:42.389
Give it a free hand.

29:42.391 --> 29:43.924
Mm-hmm.

29:43.926 --> 29:47.794
Mm-hmm.

29:47.796 --> 29:50.597
(Mama Polk straining)

29:50.599 --> 29:51.898
LOT:
Hey.

29:51.900 --> 29:54.801
Mm-hmm.

29:54.803 --> 29:57.337
Rub it in.
Mm-hmm.

29:57.339 --> 29:59.006
Rub it.
Yeah, rub it.

29:59.008 --> 30:01.608
Come on. Yeah.
Rub it.
LOT:
Rub it.

30:01.610 --> 30:02.976
Rub it.
Come on.
Mm-hmm.

30:02.978 --> 30:05.445
Don't waste a drop.

30:05.447 --> 30:07.080
Cover every inch.

30:07.082 --> 30:08.415
Jesus.
Mm-hmm.

30:08.417 --> 30:12.586
That there's
good peanut oil.

30:12.588 --> 30:15.522
(crying):
Jesus.
(grunting)

30:15.524 --> 30:17.524
Never skimp on seasoning.

30:17.526 --> 30:18.825
(laughter)

30:18.827 --> 30:20.961
That's it.

30:20.963 --> 30:22.796
Shouldn't take more
than a couple hours now.

30:22.798 --> 30:26.600
What the hell are you doing?

30:26.602 --> 30:27.934
(laughter)
LOT:
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

30:27.936 --> 30:30.537
Everybody knows the
secret to sweet meats

30:30.539 --> 30:32.673
is tenderizing.

30:32.675 --> 30:34.675
No! Oh...

30:34.677 --> 30:36.677
(scream echoes)

30:43.886 --> 30:47.721
I came back for him.

30:49.024 --> 30:50.357
Shelby...

30:50.359 --> 30:52.626
let me have the crowbar.

30:52.628 --> 30:56.797
Shelby.
Please, please, Shelby, please,

30:56.799 --> 30:57.964
please give me the crowbar.

30:57.966 --> 30:59.733
Please.

30:59.735 --> 31:02.869
(sobbing)
Shelby, let go of
the crowbar, please.

31:02.871 --> 31:04.237
It's okay.

31:04.239 --> 31:05.605
All right.

31:09.044 --> 31:12.879
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God!

31:12.881 --> 31:16.016
(sobbing and
speaking incoherently)
Calm down.

31:16.018 --> 31:18.051
Matt, Matt...

31:18.053 --> 31:22.055
He's dead, he's dead,
he's dead, he's dead, he...

31:22.057 --> 31:23.924
not alive!
Listen, listen to me.

31:23.926 --> 31:25.325
Listen to me.

31:25.327 --> 31:27.828
Listen, we're gonna...
No, I-I killed him,

31:27.830 --> 31:29.730
I killed him.
I know. Shh, shh.

31:29.732 --> 31:31.064
Listen.
What I'm gonna d--
what am I gonna do?

31:31.066 --> 31:33.567
Listen, listen.
What am I gonna do?

31:33.569 --> 31:35.902
We're gonna wait right here
for the girls to come back.

31:35.904 --> 31:37.904
And then you're gonna
turn yourself in.
What?

31:37.906 --> 31:39.005
You understand?

31:39.007 --> 31:40.707
No...

31:40.709 --> 31:43.043
No, no, Dom...

31:43.045 --> 31:45.612
Dominic, no, you have to help...
you have to help me.

31:45.614 --> 31:47.214
Please, I didn't mean to
hurt-- I didn't mean to.

31:47.216 --> 31:48.515
I know, I know.

31:48.517 --> 31:50.684
Listen, Shelby, I am,
I am helping you.

31:50.686 --> 31:53.253
I am helping you.

31:53.255 --> 31:54.721
But there's cameras everywhere.
What?

31:54.723 --> 31:57.023
They're everywhere.

31:57.025 --> 31:59.693
Sidney's watching everything.

31:59.695 --> 32:02.395
(deep shuddering breath)

32:02.397 --> 32:03.764
They know it was you.

32:03.766 --> 32:05.866
(panting)

32:05.868 --> 32:07.601
I mean, I...
I tried to stopped you,

32:07.603 --> 32:09.035
but you were so out of it,

32:09.037 --> 32:10.804
there was nothing I could do.

32:10.806 --> 32:13.039
(sighs)

32:13.041 --> 32:18.044
The best thing for you to do
is to confess and go quietly.

32:19.281 --> 32:21.615
I...

32:21.617 --> 32:23.150
I didn't mean...

32:23.152 --> 32:25.919
I didn't mean to hurt him.
I know, I know, girl.

32:25.921 --> 32:29.923
I know.
Hang on, hang on.
(water running)

32:29.925 --> 32:31.625
(water stops)

32:31.627 --> 32:33.927
I know, I know, I know, baby.

32:33.929 --> 32:35.929
I know.

32:35.931 --> 32:37.597
I loved him so much.
I know.

32:37.599 --> 32:39.566
I loved him so much.

32:39.568 --> 32:42.636
I know.
You do? You know?

32:42.638 --> 32:44.938
What are you doing?
What a second.
(breathing rapidly)

32:44.940 --> 32:46.773
What? No.
Come here, come here.

32:46.775 --> 32:48.975
No, wait, no, no.

32:48.977 --> 32:51.178
(crash in the distance)

32:51.180 --> 32:52.946
I don't want...
Hey, listen.

32:52.948 --> 32:54.147
That's-that's them.

32:54.149 --> 32:56.817
Listen, I-I need you
to sit here, okay?

32:56.819 --> 32:58.218
Just stay right here.

33:07.095 --> 33:09.863
Oh, shit.

33:09.865 --> 33:12.165
(Monet sobbing)
Can I please have a bite?

33:12.167 --> 33:15.702
(snorting)
It's all I have left, please.

33:15.704 --> 33:17.103
Get out my face.

33:17.105 --> 33:19.005
MONET (crying):
Please, please.

33:19.007 --> 33:21.441
JETHER:
Hello, ladies.

33:21.443 --> 33:24.211
Smile for the camera.

33:24.213 --> 33:26.313
Smile.

33:26.315 --> 33:27.681
Smile, goddamn it!

33:27.683 --> 33:30.851
(Lot laughs)
MAMA POLK:
Jether!

33:30.853 --> 33:36.690
Leave them girls alone.

33:36.692 --> 33:39.693
Eat up.

33:39.695 --> 33:41.461
You need your strength.

33:41.463 --> 33:43.864
(Monet sobbing)

33:43.866 --> 33:45.232
MONET:
Oh, please.

33:45.234 --> 33:48.468
Please, please, please,
please let us go.

33:48.470 --> 33:51.204
(sobbing)

33:51.206 --> 33:54.875
We won't say a word
about this to anyone.

33:54.877 --> 33:59.045
I-I swear, I swear.
(sobs hysterically)

33:59.047 --> 34:01.548
Oh, my God.
Please...

34:01.550 --> 34:03.516
Oh, my God, where's Lee?

34:03.518 --> 34:05.986
MAMA POLK:
Come on now, don't be rude.

34:05.988 --> 34:09.389
Y'all is guests.

34:09.391 --> 34:11.258
Eat.

34:11.260 --> 34:13.693
What have you done
with her, you monsters?

34:13.695 --> 34:14.995
She said eat!

34:14.997 --> 34:17.597
(cattle prod zaps,
women screaming)

34:18.934 --> 34:21.401
(laughs)

34:21.403 --> 34:22.903
MAMA POLK:
Come on now.

34:22.905 --> 34:25.538
She's a little chewy,
but she ain't that bad.

34:25.540 --> 34:26.940
AUDREY:
Oh, God!

34:30.178 --> 34:33.546
No, no, Monet, no,
no, no, no, no, no!

34:33.548 --> 34:34.915
Come on now.

34:34.917 --> 34:35.882
(zap)
(screams)

34:35.884 --> 34:38.985
(Mama Polk laughs)

34:42.791 --> 34:44.591
LOT: Come on, come on.
MAMA POLK: Monet's
doing real good. Yup.

34:44.593 --> 34:46.927
LOT:
There we go, down the hatch.

34:46.929 --> 34:50.864
(Monet gagging)
You's too, come on now.

34:50.866 --> 34:54.968
(laughter and
indistinct chatter)

34:54.970 --> 34:58.104
<i> Am an theine far</i>
<i> gach uile chnoic.</i>

34:58.106 --> 35:00.874
<i> Am an sci'ath...</i>

35:00.876 --> 35:03.810
DOMINIC:<i> Why the hell</i>
<i> is she filming this?</i>

35:03.812 --> 35:07.213
<i>Am an sleagh catha.</i>

35:07.215 --> 35:12.819
(as Thomasin):
Venomous beasts, ye have
no claim to this land.

35:12.821 --> 35:14.955
It is mine!

35:14.957 --> 35:18.758
Ye defile this earth
with thy presence.

35:18.760 --> 35:23.630
Now ye shall feel
the wrath of The Butcher!

35:23.632 --> 35:30.070
Glorious vengeance forged
in fiery conflagration!

35:30.072 --> 35:33.840
Jeez, how are we gonna stop them
from getting into the house?

35:33.842 --> 35:37.210
You can't stop them.

35:43.085 --> 35:46.987
My brethren!

35:46.989 --> 35:50.824
You've come to help
me take my vengeance!

35:50.826 --> 35:53.193
(Agnes cackles)

35:54.429 --> 35:56.596
You're finished!

35:56.598 --> 35:58.832
(laughs)

36:12.848 --> 36:16.116
(normal voice):
You're The Butcher.

36:20.822 --> 36:23.356
My idol.

36:27.629 --> 36:29.129
My maker.

36:29.131 --> 36:30.530
Oh.

36:31.833 --> 36:34.034
(crying):
I'm sorry.

36:34.036 --> 36:36.603
I just wanted to be on TV.

36:40.742 --> 36:42.809
(yells)
Oh, shit!
