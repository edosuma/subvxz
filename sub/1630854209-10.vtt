WEBVTT

00:01.566 --> 00:03.742
<i>Previously on</i> East New York... Whoa, whoa.

00:06.354 --> 00:08.138
Arliss Gruen,
Drug Enforcement Administration.

00:08.138 --> 00:09.835
'Cause we're going after
a Mexican drug cartel

00:09.835 --> 00:11.489
supplying the Santiagos.

00:11.489 --> 00:14.797
<i>I've got an undercover that's
gotten close them, Sean Dryden.</i>

00:14.797 --> 00:15.928
You used to be in Narcotics.

00:15.928 --> 00:17.626
- You look me up?
- You didn't look me up?

00:17.626 --> 00:18.670
Of course I did.

00:18.670 --> 00:21.108
What's that?
Looked you up.

00:23.197 --> 00:25.112
That's Napoleon Santiago.

00:28.158 --> 00:29.203
Go time.

00:30.204 --> 00:31.292
Police! Don't move!

00:31.292 --> 00:32.989
Hands where I
can see 'em.

00:32.989 --> 00:35.165
I remember when
you were just a kid.

00:35.165 --> 00:37.254
Were you one of the cops that
tried to lock up my old man?

00:37.254 --> 00:39.996
Your old man, your brother
Kiki, your cousins...

00:39.996 --> 00:41.693
Yeah, you ain't have much
luck with any of 'em.

00:41.693 --> 00:42.781
I got you, Napoleon.

00:42.781 --> 00:44.348
And they next.

00:44.348 --> 00:45.741
<i>I guess if we were
to try it again,</i>

00:45.741 --> 00:47.699
we'd probably screw it up again,
wouldn't we?

00:47.699 --> 00:48.787
Probably.

00:48.787 --> 00:50.702
But that's not a reason not to

00:50.702 --> 00:51.964
give it a try.

00:51.964 --> 00:54.054
<i>Sandeford, he knows.</i>

00:54.054 --> 00:55.185
I think we need to cool it.

00:55.185 --> 00:56.665
I don't want to
keep this a secret

00:56.665 --> 00:59.189
any longer
than we need to.

00:59.189 --> 01:00.538
<i>You're training me to be a cop.</i>

01:00.538 --> 01:02.540
No, I'm training
you to be like me.

01:02.540 --> 01:04.542
If you're training me
to be like you,

01:04.542 --> 01:06.414
why don't you let me drive
every once in a while?

01:06.414 --> 01:08.285
Think fast.

01:12.159 --> 01:13.551
Want to drive?
Let's go.

01:13.551 --> 01:15.379
You sit down over
- there, all excited.
- All right.

01:16.772 --> 01:19.166
Who's got it
better than us?
Nobody.

01:20.602 --> 01:21.951
What's up, man?

01:24.519 --> 01:25.563
Bentley!

01:26.347 --> 01:27.348
Oh, no.

01:32.570 --> 01:35.530
10-13, 10-13, my partner's down!
Cop shot.

01:35.530 --> 01:36.661
New Lots and
Van Siclen.

01:36.661 --> 01:38.924
Get a bus down here now!

01:38.924 --> 01:40.448
Where you hit?

01:40.448 --> 01:41.449
I got you.

01:41.449 --> 01:44.278
Oh, I don't feel anything.

01:46.541 --> 01:47.803
7-4, Sector David.

01:47.803 --> 01:51.981
Where's the bus?!

01:51.981 --> 01:53.635
Hang in there, young man.

01:53.635 --> 01:55.158
I got you.

01:55.158 --> 01:56.159
Hang in.

01:56.159 --> 01:57.160
Hey, hey, hey.

01:57.160 --> 01:58.770
Hey...

02:02.078 --> 02:04.080
<i>Bentley's being transferred
to Eastern Memorial.</i>

02:04.080 --> 02:05.429
<i>Tell me what you got.</i>

02:05.429 --> 02:07.692
Operations are
coordinating with Highway.

02:07.692 --> 02:09.259
- What's his condition?
- We're responding
to the scene now.

02:09.259 --> 02:12.219
- One minute out.
- Any script on the perp?

02:13.437 --> 02:15.222
The bus just left.

02:17.311 --> 02:18.964
How did this happen?

02:20.183 --> 02:22.446
24-year-old male
police officer.

02:22.446 --> 02:24.144
Gunshot wound
to the left abdomen.

02:24.144 --> 02:26.711
Complaining of chest pains,
difficulty breathing.

02:26.711 --> 02:30.237
BP 84/50, pulse ox low-- 82%.

02:30.237 --> 02:31.803
Pulse thready,
120 beats per minute.

02:31.803 --> 02:33.283
Pulse dropping, cascading.

02:33.283 --> 02:34.589
We need to intubate him.

02:34.589 --> 02:36.286
Two units of negative O, stat.

02:36.286 --> 02:39.202
Page Cardiothoracic
and get the OR ready.

02:48.820 --> 02:49.604
Do you know who it is?

02:49.604 --> 02:50.953
They're not saying.

02:54.565 --> 02:57.525
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

02:58.743 --> 03:01.224
Is this... Is this
Andre's blood?

03:01.224 --> 03:02.486
Where is he?

03:02.486 --> 03:03.487
Everything happened so fast.

03:03.487 --> 03:04.706
He's at the hospital.

03:04.706 --> 03:06.011
Okay, I got to go.

03:06.011 --> 03:07.448
I got to go over there.

03:07.448 --> 03:09.145
Officer Quinlan, I need you
to focus your attention

03:09.145 --> 03:10.842
on where it needs to be.
Can you do that?

03:13.367 --> 03:14.498
Okay.

03:14.498 --> 03:16.674
We need to get
security camera footage

03:16.674 --> 03:20.025
from the Belt to the Jackie
Robinson Parkway, east to west.

03:20.025 --> 03:21.766
Uh, Detective, can you
- get them started on that?
- Yes, ma'am.

03:21.766 --> 03:23.768
You got it. Come on, guys.

03:27.468 --> 03:29.165
You get a look
at the shooter?

03:29.165 --> 03:31.036
- It was too quick.
- What about the car?

03:31.036 --> 03:33.865
Tan. I think it had
a dent in the trunk lid.

03:33.865 --> 03:34.997
Yeah, I'm 10-84 on the scene.

03:36.303 --> 03:37.347
Officer Sandeford,
we're gonna need to

03:37.347 --> 03:38.696
get you over to
the hospital.

03:38.696 --> 03:40.394
- I-I'm not hurt.
- You still got to
get checked out.

03:40.394 --> 03:41.438
I'm not hurt, Chief.

03:42.526 --> 03:44.485
I got off around five or six
rounds at the vehicle.

03:44.485 --> 03:45.747
I don't think
I hit anything.

03:45.747 --> 03:47.270
We got Crime Scene
over here now.

03:47.270 --> 03:48.315
They're gonna be wanting
to look at your gun.

03:48.315 --> 03:49.359
Luke?

03:53.450 --> 03:55.104
Marvin, both of them.

04:00.327 --> 04:02.416
Take Officer Sandeford
to the hospital, please.

04:06.115 --> 04:07.464
Nothing on the tags.

04:07.464 --> 04:08.944
Not even a partial?

04:08.944 --> 04:10.815
Plates were covered.
Family's been notified.

04:10.815 --> 04:13.209
Father's in Japan on business,

04:13.209 --> 04:15.603
the mother's the only one
presently in the New York area.

04:15.603 --> 04:17.039
Highway is bringing her in.

04:17.039 --> 04:18.301
How far out is she?

04:18.301 --> 04:20.347
They got on the Saw Mill
about five minutes ago.

04:20.347 --> 04:21.739
Have sector cars from the Bronx

04:21.739 --> 04:24.481
shut down
the Henry Hudson Parkway.

04:24.481 --> 04:25.961
I pray that Bentley lives,

04:25.961 --> 04:29.094
but if he dies, I want his
mother to make it in time.

04:53.989 --> 04:55.207
That's his mother.

04:59.299 --> 05:01.823
Dr. Bentley,
I'm Regina Haywood,

05:01.823 --> 05:03.694
your son's
commanding officer.

05:03.694 --> 05:05.087
- John Suarez, Borough Commander.
- I would like to know

05:05.087 --> 05:06.523
what my son's condition is.

05:06.523 --> 05:08.525
He was shot. Uh, they're
still assessing the damage...

05:08.525 --> 05:10.832
Ms. Haywood, I'm a doctor.

05:10.832 --> 05:12.790
I would like to be told
by another doctor

05:12.790 --> 05:15.271
in precise language
what my son's condition is.

05:15.271 --> 05:17.012
I'll arrange for a doctor
to speak with you right now.

05:17.012 --> 05:18.666
Thank you.

05:18.666 --> 05:21.059
And we have a-a room for
you and your family right...

05:21.059 --> 05:22.234
it's this way.

05:36.031 --> 05:37.337
All right, let me know.

05:37.337 --> 05:38.425
Where are we on this?

05:38.425 --> 05:39.339
We have a description
out on the car.

05:39.339 --> 05:40.731
So far, nothing.

05:40.731 --> 05:42.777
Including chop shops
and stolen vehicle reports.

05:42.777 --> 05:44.387
Check out which gangs
frequent the area.

05:44.387 --> 05:46.084
This could've been between them,
and Bentley

05:46.084 --> 05:47.434
caught a stray bullet.

05:47.434 --> 05:48.435
We've checked with
Gang Intelligence.

05:48.435 --> 05:49.871
They're looking at social media

05:49.871 --> 05:51.438
to see if there's some kind
of gang beef going on.

05:51.438 --> 05:52.569
What about personal?

05:52.569 --> 05:53.657
Personal to Bentley?

05:53.657 --> 05:55.050
To Bentley or to Sandeford.

05:55.050 --> 05:56.225
Well, Sandeford did
say he usually is

05:56.225 --> 05:57.922
the one to drive but this time

05:57.922 --> 05:59.620
let Bentley take the wheel.

05:59.620 --> 06:00.882
That bodega's a
regular spot for them.

06:00.882 --> 06:03.058
Somebody could have
staked it out.

06:03.058 --> 06:06.366
Did I already ask about
security camera footage?

06:06.366 --> 06:08.106
Yeah, boss, I-I told you:

06:08.106 --> 06:10.370
some of the cameras are working,
a lot of them don't.

06:15.244 --> 06:16.854
Find something.

06:20.989 --> 06:22.991
I have an update

06:22.991 --> 06:24.993
on the condition
of the officer who was shot.

06:24.993 --> 06:26.603
His condition
at present is critical.

06:26.603 --> 06:28.126
Is there a suspect?

06:28.126 --> 06:31.434
The officer and his partner
had stopped to get coffee,

06:31.434 --> 06:33.305
and when they came out
an individual

06:33.305 --> 06:36.091
driving what has been identified

06:36.091 --> 06:38.615
as a tan four-door sedan
with tinted windows

06:38.615 --> 06:40.574
fired two rounds,

06:40.574 --> 06:43.446
one of those rounds hitting
the officer just above his vest.

06:43.446 --> 06:45.317
We've set up a hotline

06:45.317 --> 06:47.755
for anyone who has
information regarding this.

06:47.755 --> 06:49.060
Can we have the officer's
name, Chief?

06:49.060 --> 06:51.236
Pending notification
of the officer's family,

06:51.236 --> 06:52.150
we're gonna wait on that.

06:52.150 --> 06:53.195
Does the department

06:53.195 --> 06:55.110
place this in
a larger context?

06:55.110 --> 06:56.894
Like what kind
of larger context?

06:56.894 --> 06:58.853
There are those who see cops

06:58.853 --> 07:00.289
as legitimate targets given all

07:00.289 --> 07:03.161
of the police-
involved shootings

07:03.161 --> 07:04.424
of unarmed individuals.

07:04.424 --> 07:08.166
I got a young cop who is, uh,

07:08.166 --> 07:10.212
fighting for his life...

07:10.212 --> 07:13.998
and right now that's, uh,
taking up all of my attention.

07:13.998 --> 07:14.999
Thank you.

07:21.484 --> 07:22.833
Bentley's out of surgery.

07:22.833 --> 07:23.965
I know.

07:24.966 --> 07:26.315
We making any progress?

07:27.751 --> 07:30.667
Gang Unit says it's...
not gangs.

07:30.667 --> 07:32.930
So we're looking in
to see if there's anything

07:32.930 --> 07:35.803
Sandeford or Bentley might have
been into that accounts for it.

07:35.803 --> 07:41.156
Anyone they might know
looking to settle the score.

07:41.156 --> 07:43.637
We got a whole task force
working on this, Regina.

07:43.637 --> 07:45.726
Yeah, I wish I still
smoked, you know?

07:45.726 --> 07:47.249
Would that make it easier?

07:47.249 --> 07:49.773
It'd give me something
to do with my hands.

07:51.166 --> 07:52.820
He's the one who saved me. Bentley.

07:54.952 --> 07:57.041
Somebody told me he looked
like a legit linebacker

07:57.041 --> 07:58.434
when he tackled you.

07:58.434 --> 08:00.001
If he hadn't,
that concrete that kid threw

08:00.001 --> 08:01.872
would've killed me for sure.

08:01.872 --> 08:03.352
For sure.

08:03.352 --> 08:05.572
Let's not start giving
eulogies just yet, Regina.

08:05.572 --> 08:07.748
Yeah, I know.

08:11.969 --> 08:13.101
I'm glad you still
don't smoke, though.

08:14.232 --> 08:15.407
Why is that?

08:15.407 --> 08:16.757
If you did, I'd want
to bum a cigarette

08:16.757 --> 08:18.193
and then I'd still smoke.

08:18.193 --> 08:20.500
Yeah, I know that's right.

08:35.645 --> 08:37.429
Come on!

08:39.954 --> 08:41.085
You didn't put in
enough money.

08:41.085 --> 08:42.130
Oh.

08:47.222 --> 08:48.745
Thank you.

08:48.745 --> 08:51.487
We're looking into whether
the shooter targeted

08:51.487 --> 08:52.793
Bentley or Sandeford.

08:52.793 --> 08:54.882
As opposed to just
wanting to shoot a cop?

08:54.882 --> 08:56.753
Just trying to
rule things out.

08:56.753 --> 08:59.930
Well, I don't know enough about
either one of them to say.

09:07.111 --> 09:09.070
How long have you
and Bentley been involved?

09:10.854 --> 09:13.683
I could spot the way you look at
each other from across the room.

09:18.775 --> 09:20.211
Andre didn't want it to get out.

09:23.911 --> 09:26.087
Now's not the time
to worry about that.

09:26.087 --> 09:28.524
So if you're asking me if
I know any deep, dark secrets,

09:28.524 --> 09:30.134
the answer is, I don't.

09:30.134 --> 09:32.397
I honestly don't
think Andre has any.

09:43.321 --> 09:44.801
<i>Bentley's a rookie.</i>

09:44.801 --> 09:47.369
He hasn't been on the job
long enough to make enemies.

09:47.369 --> 09:48.805
What about off the job?

09:48.805 --> 09:51.982
Nothing. Lived with his
parents after college.

09:51.982 --> 09:53.070
Seems like a straight shooter.

09:53.070 --> 09:55.290
And Sandeford,
on the other hand,

09:55.290 --> 09:58.075
kicks out a couple
of distinct possibilities.

09:58.075 --> 10:00.251
He collared an OC enforcer
named Benny DeStefano

10:00.251 --> 10:01.557
for murdering
and dismembering

10:01.557 --> 10:02.906
a Russian
nightclub owner.

10:02.906 --> 10:04.560
When he was putting
DeStefano in the car,

10:04.560 --> 10:05.953
there were photographers.

10:05.953 --> 10:08.042
DeStefano tried
to hide his face,

10:08.042 --> 10:10.087
Sandeford grabbed him by the
chin and wouldn't let him do it.

10:10.087 --> 10:12.786
Two weeks ago, one of the
Russians he was locked up with

10:12.786 --> 10:13.874
stabbed DeStefano to death

10:13.874 --> 10:16.050
in the Brooklyn
House of Detention.

10:16.050 --> 10:18.095
Did somebody blame
Sandeford for that?

10:18.095 --> 10:19.749
Yeah, DeStefano's
brother's half-mobbed up,

10:19.749 --> 10:21.664
he's been heard making
threats, so it's a possibility.

10:23.057 --> 10:24.493
Okay. That it?

10:24.493 --> 10:26.364
Sandeford has also been
spending time with this woman

10:26.364 --> 10:27.627
named Tamika Martin,

10:27.627 --> 10:28.802
who he used to live with.

10:28.802 --> 10:30.542
Don't tell me she has a husband.

10:30.542 --> 10:32.501
An ex-husband
named Miguel Arias,

10:32.501 --> 10:34.546
who got physically abusive
enough with her in the past

10:34.546 --> 10:36.505
for her to get
an order of protection.

10:36.505 --> 10:38.333
Okay, bring in
the DeStefano brother

10:38.333 --> 10:40.596
and Tamika's ex-husband,
let's see what we got.

10:44.731 --> 10:45.949
We understand
you may have a problem

10:45.949 --> 10:47.995
with one of our officers.

10:47.995 --> 10:49.910
Oh, yeah?

10:49.910 --> 10:51.172
Who's that?

10:51.172 --> 10:52.913
Marvin Sandeford.

10:52.913 --> 10:56.525
Yeah. I got a big problem
with Marvin Sandeford.

10:58.005 --> 10:58.962
<i>When's the last time
you had contact</i>

10:58.962 --> 11:00.660
with your
ex-wife, Miguel?

11:00.660 --> 11:01.965
I saw her a couple of weeks ago.

11:01.965 --> 11:02.966
She by herself?

11:02.966 --> 11:04.054
<i>So you think</i>

11:04.054 --> 11:05.360
Officer Sandeford
put the word out

11:05.360 --> 11:06.840
that your brother was a snitch?

11:06.840 --> 11:09.625
I'm telling you, Sandeford
had it in for my brother.

11:09.625 --> 11:11.279
No, she was with
her cop boyfriend.

11:11.279 --> 11:12.280
DeSTEFANO:
<i>I mean, maybe</i>

11:12.280 --> 11:13.760
Benny opened up his mouth.

11:13.760 --> 11:15.413
Maybe Sandeford just wanted
to show him how much

11:15.413 --> 11:17.372
of a tough guy he is.
Either way,

11:17.372 --> 11:19.026
my brother paid the price.

11:19.026 --> 11:20.505
You and her cop boyfriend
get into it?

11:20.505 --> 11:22.812
Why? He filing charges
against me for harassment?

11:22.812 --> 11:24.118
I just want to see
how far it went.

11:24.118 --> 11:26.207
It didn't go nowhere.
I said my piece,

11:26.207 --> 11:27.817
I got in my car
and went to Nyack,

11:27.817 --> 11:29.297
where I got people who love me.

11:29.297 --> 11:30.951
Where were you today
around noon, Arthur?

11:30.951 --> 11:32.517
Where were you
around noon today, Miguel?

11:32.517 --> 11:33.736
DeSTEFANO:
<i>I was in physical therapy</i>

11:33.736 --> 11:35.129
from 11:30 to 2:30.

11:35.999 --> 11:37.566
Around noon I was at the
lumberyard buying Sheetrock.

11:38.567 --> 11:40.090
- Want to check?
- This joker.

11:40.090 --> 11:41.439
Yeah, I do.

11:41.439 --> 11:43.703
Did you shoot my partner,
- Miguel?
- Damn it.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.661
- Do what? What'd I do?
- I said, did you
shoot my partner?

11:45.661 --> 11:47.271
Get out of the room, Sandeford.
I didn't shoot nobody.

11:47.271 --> 11:49.404
- Then what are you doing here?!
- Ask them what I'm doing here!

11:49.404 --> 11:52.059
- Whoa!
- Whoa, Marvin! Marvin!

11:52.059 --> 11:53.974
Marvin, get off of him!

11:53.974 --> 11:56.150
Get off of him! Are you okay?

11:56.150 --> 11:57.325
Are you all right?

11:57.325 --> 11:58.456
- I didn't shoot nobody!
- All right.

11:58.456 --> 12:00.110
You all right?

12:00.110 --> 12:01.764
Tell him I didn't
- shoot nobody.
- Okay.

12:01.764 --> 12:02.852
Bentley opened his eyes.

12:21.958 --> 12:23.699
Look at this guy,
he's ready to go back to work.

12:23.699 --> 12:25.483
We'll have to wait
and see about that.

12:25.483 --> 12:26.789
Of course.

12:26.789 --> 12:28.443
I would have preferred
that he have no visitors,

12:28.443 --> 12:31.402
but he insisted
on talking to you.

12:31.402 --> 12:33.796
Mom, just let me tell them.

12:33.796 --> 12:35.755
Fine.

12:35.755 --> 12:37.234
I'll leave you alone.

12:37.234 --> 12:39.106
Please keep it brief.

12:39.106 --> 12:40.150
Yes, ma'am.

12:46.374 --> 12:48.942
Shooter's car.

12:48.942 --> 12:50.378
I saw it more than once.

12:50.378 --> 12:52.032
Where else did you see it?

12:52.032 --> 12:54.164
At the precinct.

12:54.164 --> 12:56.906
At the food truck outside.

12:56.906 --> 12:59.474
It had a bumper sticker
that said "Bedstuy Tech."

13:02.782 --> 13:04.740
I never knew there
was a Bedstuy Tech.

13:05.915 --> 13:07.961
Are you all right?

13:07.961 --> 13:09.005
Andre?

13:10.877 --> 13:12.835
Can we get someone
- in here, please?
- It's gonna be okay, all right?

13:12.835 --> 13:14.576
We're gonna get some help... Can we get some help in here?

13:14.576 --> 13:15.620
Okay?

13:16.621 --> 13:17.622
We're right here.

13:19.189 --> 13:20.234
Andre.

13:20.234 --> 13:21.409
Come on, baby. Breathe.

13:21.409 --> 13:22.410
Come on.

13:22.410 --> 13:23.890
Andre...

13:23.890 --> 13:25.456
Come on, baby. Breathe.

13:25.456 --> 13:28.808
Breathe.

13:30.897 --> 13:32.028
Breathe, Andre.

13:37.207 --> 13:40.210
A Bedstuy Tech teacher reported
his car stolen yesterday.

13:40.210 --> 13:42.125
Yeah, it was
a tan Chevy Malibu.

13:42.125 --> 13:43.344
We get an ID on the thief?

13:44.649 --> 13:47.130
The Real Time Crime Center
used photo recognition

13:47.130 --> 13:48.523
to get us to this guy.

13:48.523 --> 13:49.872
And also his rap sheet.

13:49.872 --> 13:51.439
Grand larceny, 11 times.

13:51.439 --> 13:54.442
It's a big leap from boosting
cars to trying to kill a cop.

13:54.442 --> 13:55.704
Who is he?

13:55.704 --> 13:58.054
Angelo Stakely,
21 years of age,

13:58.054 --> 14:00.361
last known address--
Mott Haven section of the Bronx.

14:00.361 --> 14:02.972
Yeah, detectives from 4-4
are bringing him in now.

14:16.594 --> 14:17.769
There you go.

14:17.769 --> 14:18.901
Thanks, I'll
take it from here.

14:24.298 --> 14:25.429
You okay?

14:28.041 --> 14:29.346
You?

14:31.435 --> 14:32.784
I was too slow.

14:32.784 --> 14:34.961
Younger reflexes might've
got the shot off in time.

14:34.961 --> 14:37.485
Hey. Look, you
don't know that.

14:42.359 --> 14:43.883
You have blood under
your fingernails.

14:51.499 --> 14:52.761
Boss.

14:52.761 --> 14:54.284
Is there any chance

14:54.284 --> 14:55.546
I could be in
the observation room while

14:55.546 --> 14:57.287
- you're questioning this guy?
- Absolutely not.

14:57.287 --> 14:58.941
I got to tell you,
it's almost impossible

14:58.941 --> 15:00.334
staying sidelined
from all of this.

15:00.334 --> 15:02.162
Let me stay
abreast of it.

15:02.162 --> 15:05.078
I possibly can guide the
detectives in the questioning.

15:05.078 --> 15:06.122
Marvin...

15:06.122 --> 15:08.516
You were the witness
to the shooting.

15:08.516 --> 15:09.821
If you're
given access

15:09.821 --> 15:11.911
to the questioning
of a potential suspect,

15:11.911 --> 15:13.434
it could taint
every statement

15:13.434 --> 15:15.001
you make from
this point forward,

15:15.001 --> 15:17.003
including your
testimony at trial.

15:17.003 --> 15:19.440
You understand that?

15:24.401 --> 15:26.795
I want you to stand
down, Marvin.

15:42.985 --> 15:45.074
So, I'm guessing this was
a spur-of-the-moment thing.

15:45.074 --> 15:46.206
What was?

15:46.206 --> 15:48.338
Throwing a shot at that cop.

15:48.338 --> 15:49.861
I didn't throw no shot at a cop.

15:49.861 --> 15:51.646
It's not like you killed him.
He's gonna be fine.

15:51.646 --> 15:53.517
You just tell us what was
going through your mind.

15:53.517 --> 15:55.345
You guys, I'm...

15:55.345 --> 15:56.912
I mean, there's all
this animosity built up

15:56.912 --> 15:58.218
toward cops.
I mean, I get it.

15:58.218 --> 16:00.002
Sometimes it comes out
in the form of a shooting.

16:00.002 --> 16:03.092
No one's looking to charge you
with anything you didn't do.

16:03.092 --> 16:05.312
If it wasn't premeditated,
just tell us.

16:05.312 --> 16:06.661
Tell us that now, kid.

16:06.661 --> 16:08.054
'Cause it's only gonna
get harder to go back on

16:08.054 --> 16:09.969
what you said once
we find out it was a lie.

16:09.969 --> 16:11.883
- Tell us!
- I stole a car!

16:11.883 --> 16:13.624
That's the only thing
there is to tell.

16:13.624 --> 16:15.104
I got a call

16:15.104 --> 16:16.410
from a number I didn't know

16:16.410 --> 16:18.978
telling me they wanted
a plain American car,

16:18.978 --> 16:20.718
to leave it
in the Gateway Mall parking lot

16:20.718 --> 16:21.806
with the keys in
the wheel well.

16:21.806 --> 16:23.069
In return for which
you got what?

16:23.069 --> 16:25.332
A brick of dog food.

16:25.332 --> 16:27.247
You know what that
refers to, don't you?

16:27.247 --> 16:28.726
Yeah, I do, Stan.

16:28.726 --> 16:31.991
Yeah, "dog food" is heroin
and a brick is about 50 bags.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.862
Thank you, Stan. Thank you.

16:35.820 --> 16:37.822
The same dope we confiscated
when we pulled you over?

16:38.998 --> 16:40.390
I'm sure you're not gonna
have a problem with us

16:40.390 --> 16:41.870
going into your phone
and running down the number

16:41.870 --> 16:43.176
of whoever called you
to set it up.

16:43.176 --> 16:44.655
I don't care, man. Run it down.

16:44.655 --> 16:46.222
We're going to.

16:46.222 --> 16:48.050
No doubt it's
a burner phone.

16:48.050 --> 16:49.791
What kind of hit do
you get off this guy?

16:49.791 --> 16:51.053
That he's a car thief.

16:51.053 --> 16:54.056
He had no idea the plan
was to shoot a cop.

16:56.145 --> 16:57.929
The dope paid to this guy
for stealing the car

16:57.929 --> 17:00.236
had the same packaging
as what we confiscated

17:00.236 --> 17:01.759
from Napoleon Santiago.

17:01.759 --> 17:03.109
Which could be
a coincidence.

17:03.109 --> 17:05.067
I don't believe
in coincidence.

17:17.123 --> 17:19.255
Hey, Regina.

17:19.255 --> 17:21.040
How's tricks?

17:21.040 --> 17:22.780
You order a hit
on one of my cops?

17:22.780 --> 17:23.781
Why would I do that?

17:23.781 --> 17:25.131
You got busted two weeks ago.

17:25.131 --> 17:27.176
You might've thought
that called for retaliation.

17:27.176 --> 17:28.569
Listen, if I wanted
to retaliate,

17:28.569 --> 17:30.962
I would've just gone after you.

17:30.962 --> 17:32.051
How's he doing, by the way?

17:32.921 --> 17:35.663
You know we're gonna go
through your visitors' log,

17:35.663 --> 17:38.100
any incoming
or outgoing phone calls

17:38.100 --> 17:39.188
you may have had
since you've been here.

17:39.188 --> 17:40.320
Knock yourself out.

17:40.320 --> 17:41.451
The only people
I've been talking to

17:41.451 --> 17:43.105
are the couple of Dominicans

17:43.105 --> 17:45.281
on this wing, and all
we talk about is Robbie Canó.

17:45.281 --> 17:48.067
I find out your people
were behind this...

17:48.067 --> 17:49.807
there's gonna be
nowhere for you to hide.

17:49.807 --> 17:52.114
Don't make no threats, Inspector.

17:52.114 --> 17:54.160
You're way out
of your league.

17:54.160 --> 17:55.161
See, once you

17:55.161 --> 17:56.510
handed me over to the Feds,

17:56.510 --> 17:58.077
that's who I cut a deal with.

17:58.642 --> 18:00.644
You don't got a
say in the matter.

18:01.732 --> 18:04.039
That deal survive you
having a cop shot?

18:04.039 --> 18:06.302
One of your cops?

18:06.302 --> 18:10.132
Based on my conversations with
the DEA, I think it just might.

18:11.525 --> 18:14.745
CO on the gate?

18:14.745 --> 18:16.312
They're not real big fans
of yours over there.

18:20.664 --> 18:22.710
Bye, boo.

18:35.766 --> 18:37.768
Take a look at this.

18:37.768 --> 18:39.248
Inspector Haywood called to say

18:39.248 --> 18:41.990
that Napoleon cut a deal
with the Feds for immunity.

18:41.990 --> 18:44.166
He probably flipped on
his Mexican counterpart

18:44.166 --> 18:45.515
in return for
a reduced sentence.

18:45.515 --> 18:46.864
He's not gonna
jeopardize that

18:46.864 --> 18:48.475
to go after a cop.

18:48.475 --> 18:50.172
Yeah, scratch another
possible suspect.

18:50.172 --> 18:52.348
The whole family's in
the drug trade, right?

18:52.348 --> 18:54.263
The father's generation's
pretty much retired.

18:54.263 --> 18:58.224
Napoleon has a younger brother
Kiki who's taken a few collars

18:58.224 --> 19:01.749
and an older sister Lucia
who basically functions

19:01.749 --> 19:04.491
as a hostess whenever the boys
get together with their friends.

19:04.491 --> 19:05.666
My opinion?

19:05.666 --> 19:07.755
We went after
the Santiagos,

19:07.755 --> 19:09.670
Santiagos are coming after us.

19:09.670 --> 19:11.889
Now, I don't know
which Santiago,

19:11.889 --> 19:13.108
they're who I'd be looking at.

19:15.241 --> 19:16.242
Hey.

19:16.242 --> 19:19.636
I feel like I should
update Marvin.

19:19.636 --> 19:20.942
What are you? Crazy?

19:20.942 --> 19:22.596
He can't be anywhere
near this investigation.

19:22.596 --> 19:23.814
What? He wouldn't be
anywhere near it,

19:23.814 --> 19:24.685
he just wouldn't
be in the dark about it.

19:24.685 --> 19:25.686
Tommy,

19:25.686 --> 19:26.904
if you tell him,

19:26.904 --> 19:28.515
please don't tell me
you told him.

19:28.515 --> 19:29.820
Look, if you were
in his position,

19:29.820 --> 19:31.039
wouldn't you want to be told?

19:31.039 --> 19:32.736
What I'd want
and what I'd expect

19:32.736 --> 19:34.477
are two entirely
different things.

19:34.477 --> 19:36.218
Yeah, you'd expect me to
tell you is what you'd expect.

19:36.218 --> 19:37.915
You know what?
You're wrong.

19:44.531 --> 19:45.967
<i>How's he doing?</i>

19:45.967 --> 19:47.708
I don't know.

19:47.708 --> 19:49.231
I call over to one of
the cops at the hospital

19:49.231 --> 19:51.015
every hour or so,
they still got him listed

19:51.015 --> 19:52.191
in critical condition.

19:52.191 --> 19:53.757
Have you been to see him?

19:53.757 --> 19:55.629
Not yet, no.

19:56.891 --> 19:58.153
I'm gonna try to get
over there tonight.

19:59.285 --> 20:02.288
I'm sorry you had
to deal with Miguel.

20:03.332 --> 20:05.682
Probably the last thing
you should be dealing with.

20:05.682 --> 20:07.989
You can tell him I apologize
for the way I went at him,

20:07.989 --> 20:10.644
but I know
he didn't shoot Andre,

20:10.644 --> 20:12.472
but at the time it
seemed like a possibility.

20:12.472 --> 20:15.214
Which means the
intended target was you.

20:15.214 --> 20:17.825
I don't know, but I am
not worried about it.

20:17.825 --> 20:19.653
No, of course you're not.
Everyone who knows you

20:19.653 --> 20:22.525
and loves you can be worried
about it, but not you.

20:24.223 --> 20:26.790
Whoever the intended
target is, Tamika,

20:26.790 --> 20:28.792
I need to be out on the street
looking for the perp.

20:28.792 --> 20:30.794
I know a million people
in East New York.

20:30.794 --> 20:32.361
I've been riding up
and down these streets,

20:32.361 --> 20:36.322
climbing stairs in-in housing
projects for-for 26 years.

20:36.322 --> 20:38.802
I know things.
But that doesn't matter.

20:38.802 --> 20:42.241
I got a target on my back
and I can't even carry a gun.

20:42.241 --> 20:43.677
It's crazy that
you're unarmed.

20:43.677 --> 20:45.374
I'm good.

20:48.334 --> 20:49.509
I guess it's better

20:49.509 --> 20:52.251
to have it and not need it

20:52.251 --> 20:54.035
than to need it and not have it.

20:58.518 --> 20:59.475
I got to go.

20:59.475 --> 21:00.607
Where are you going?

21:00.607 --> 21:01.651
I got to go, Tamika,
I'll call you later.

21:01.651 --> 21:03.305
No, tell me what
you're gonna do.

21:03.305 --> 21:04.654
The powers that be

21:04.654 --> 21:07.091
got me sitting at a desk
processing parking tickets

21:07.091 --> 21:08.223
instead of being
out on the street

21:08.223 --> 21:09.485
doing what I know how to do.

21:09.485 --> 21:11.313
I'm not following
that order.

21:11.313 --> 21:12.314
Marvin, where are you going?

21:12.314 --> 21:14.664
I have to go, Tamika.

21:14.664 --> 21:17.450
Who is Santiago?

21:18.625 --> 21:20.148
<i>Marvin is usually level-headed</i>

21:20.148 --> 21:21.802
and in control of his emotions.

21:21.802 --> 21:23.804
But when he left me
and ran off just now,

21:23.804 --> 21:25.327
I feel like he wasn't.

21:25.327 --> 21:28.025
I've been calling him,
he doesn't pick up his phone.

21:28.025 --> 21:30.767
I just...

21:30.767 --> 21:33.030
don't want anything
to happen to him.

21:33.030 --> 21:35.424
Did he give you any indication
of where he was going

21:35.424 --> 21:36.817
or what he was going to do?

21:36.817 --> 21:38.471
I know he got a text

21:38.471 --> 21:40.124
that said "Santiago."

21:40.124 --> 21:42.257
But he wouldn't tell
me what it meant.

21:43.911 --> 21:44.912
You know who sent it?

21:44.912 --> 21:46.000
No.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.175
All right, you need
to let us know

21:47.175 --> 21:48.307
if Marvin gets
in touch with you.

21:48.307 --> 21:50.178
For his own good.

21:50.178 --> 21:52.093
I understand.

21:52.093 --> 21:53.442
Is there something
else, Ms. Martin?

21:55.314 --> 21:57.403
He told me that he shot at the
car as it was driving away.

21:57.403 --> 21:59.013
The shooter's car.
He said
he had to

21:59.013 --> 22:00.971
turn in his guns to be
examined by Ballistics

22:00.971 --> 22:02.364
and he had to stay

22:02.364 --> 22:04.148
inside the precinct,
working at the desk?

22:04.148 --> 22:05.367
That's the rule only

22:05.367 --> 22:07.369
in the immediate aftermath
of a shooting.

22:07.369 --> 22:08.849
You should know
Marvin has no intention

22:08.849 --> 22:10.067
of abiding by that rule.

22:11.330 --> 22:12.940
He's going out
in the street

22:12.940 --> 22:14.942
and he's got a gun.

22:37.965 --> 22:39.140
How you doing, partner?

22:39.140 --> 22:40.533
Don't hang up, Marvin.

22:40.533 --> 22:41.751
Cute trick, Inspector.

22:41.751 --> 22:43.405
I needed you to answer
the phone.

22:43.405 --> 22:45.059
People are worried about you.

22:45.059 --> 22:46.495
I can't sit idly by, boss.

22:46.495 --> 22:47.583
I ain't built that way.

22:47.583 --> 22:48.671
You are not a one-man army.

22:48.671 --> 22:50.064
And by acting like you are,

22:50.064 --> 22:52.196
you're putting yourself
and others at great risk.

22:52.196 --> 22:53.241
Unavoidable.

22:59.943 --> 23:01.249
We get a location?

23:01.249 --> 23:02.381
Did not.

23:03.817 --> 23:06.820
Thank you for letting us
use his phone.

23:06.820 --> 23:08.387
Interesting that Mr.
Sandeford is hell-bent

23:08.387 --> 23:10.824
on finding whoever shot Andre

23:10.824 --> 23:13.174
but hasn't managed to come
by the hospital to see him.

23:16.046 --> 23:17.439
Thank you.

23:24.011 --> 23:25.404
<i>Morales?</i>

23:25.404 --> 23:28.668
Have we managed to locate
Kiki or Lucia Santiago?

23:28.668 --> 23:31.845
There are unmarked cars
sitting on a few likely places.

23:31.845 --> 23:34.064
If they grab them up, have
them bring them in right away.

23:34.064 --> 23:35.544
You got it.

23:35.544 --> 23:37.546
Stan, start looking into
who sent Sandeford the text

23:37.546 --> 23:39.635
that it was Santiago
who shot Bentley.

23:39.635 --> 23:40.854
Well, I'm sorry to say,

23:40.854 --> 23:42.725
but whoever did it
isn't going to admit it.

23:42.725 --> 23:44.466
I know they wouldn't,
but I want them nervous

23:44.466 --> 23:45.989
- we'll find out anyway.
- All right.

23:45.989 --> 23:48.252
Bentley's mom called
from the hospital,

23:48.252 --> 23:50.341
asked if someone could bring
over a change of clothes.

23:51.734 --> 23:53.693
This is her thinking
he's about to go home.

23:53.693 --> 23:55.477
Guess it helps
to think that way.

23:55.477 --> 23:58.698
There's something's going on
between him and Quinlan.

23:58.698 --> 23:59.829
Send her.

24:15.932 --> 24:17.238
How is he?

24:17.238 --> 24:19.283
He's hanging in.

24:19.283 --> 24:21.590
We were watching on the news.

24:23.287 --> 24:25.159
I actually have to grab
some of his things.

24:26.769 --> 24:27.944
I'm praying for him.

24:29.555 --> 24:30.512
Thank you.

24:30.512 --> 24:31.948
A bunch of us are.

24:33.602 --> 24:34.821
I'll let him know.

26:02.648 --> 26:04.214
What it is, fellas?

26:05.215 --> 26:06.826
Minding our business.

26:07.653 --> 26:09.568
The terms of your
bail release, uh,

26:09.568 --> 26:11.874
allow you to be in an
establishment serving alcohol?

26:13.136 --> 26:14.747
Ain't nobody tell us otherwise.

26:14.747 --> 26:16.618
You're probably fine, then.
But what about that

26:16.618 --> 26:19.186
possession of narcotics with
intent to distribute charge?

26:19.186 --> 26:20.927
That's not your concern.

26:22.189 --> 26:24.408
- You heard a cop was shot today?
- Mm-hmm.

26:24.408 --> 26:25.496
Mm.

26:25.496 --> 26:27.107
Yeah, that was my partner.

26:27.107 --> 26:28.325
I'm sorry to hear that.

26:28.325 --> 26:30.110
And I got reason
to believe the shooter

26:30.110 --> 26:32.329
- was one of the Santiagos.
- Man, Napoleon's in jail

26:32.329 --> 26:33.940
and Lucia ain't gonna do
nothing like that, so...

26:33.940 --> 26:35.550
Kiki just might.

26:35.550 --> 26:37.465
Did anybody say that to you?

26:39.336 --> 26:40.990
I'll tell you what's probably
happening right now.

26:40.990 --> 26:42.992
The US Attorney for
the Eastern District

26:42.992 --> 26:44.341
is making arrangements
for Napoleon Santiago

26:44.341 --> 26:46.387
to go into
the Witness Protection Program

26:46.387 --> 26:48.563
instead of going to prison.

26:48.563 --> 26:50.304
And in return, Napoleon
Santiago is offering

26:50.304 --> 26:52.132
the US Attorney
enough information

26:52.132 --> 26:53.786
to send other
people to prison,

26:53.786 --> 26:55.265
a lot of other people.

26:56.310 --> 26:58.268
- Man, you lying.
- You can take that chance.

26:58.268 --> 26:59.661
Mm-hmm.

26:59.661 --> 27:01.054
But providing information
leading to the arrest

27:01.054 --> 27:02.359
of someone who shot a cop?

27:02.359 --> 27:05.232
That's very
valuable information.

27:05.232 --> 27:06.320
And you might seriously

27:06.320 --> 27:08.975
consider that coming from you.

27:11.107 --> 27:12.674
So, you're saying no jail time?

27:12.674 --> 27:14.720
I can't make that call.

27:14.720 --> 27:15.895
But I'd say

27:15.895 --> 27:18.637
there's a good chance
of no jail time.

27:23.642 --> 27:25.905
So, I tell you where Kiki is,

27:25.905 --> 27:28.124
Santiagos just gonna
let it go?

27:28.124 --> 27:29.865
Santiagos is over and done.

27:30.910 --> 27:32.694
As soon as they
quit making money,

27:32.694 --> 27:34.914
their enforcers and
foot soldiers are gone.

27:34.914 --> 27:36.959
And what this comes down to

27:36.959 --> 27:38.569
is either they sending you
to prison

27:38.569 --> 27:40.049
or you sending them.

27:42.617 --> 27:46.142
If that's the case,
I'm not going in.

27:46.142 --> 27:47.927
You know him better
than I do, brother.

27:47.927 --> 27:48.971
Do what you got to do.

27:53.280 --> 27:55.064
If I tell you,
you won't forget, right?

27:55.064 --> 27:58.633
If you tell me where
I can find Kiki,

27:58.633 --> 28:00.853
I ain't never gonna forget.

<i>Hey.</i>

28:26.182 --> 28:27.618
Morales just
brought in

28:27.618 --> 28:29.490
Lucia Santiago.
She's in the interview room.

28:29.490 --> 28:31.710
Tell Morales
I want to question her myself.

28:41.937 --> 28:42.938
How's it going?

28:42.938 --> 28:44.113
How's what?

28:44.113 --> 28:45.811
How is it...

28:45.811 --> 28:49.031
taking orders
from your brothers?

28:49.031 --> 28:50.685
We get along just fine.

28:50.685 --> 28:53.732
So long as you're willing
to serve and smile

28:53.732 --> 28:55.995
and shut your mouth
when they talk business,

28:55.995 --> 29:00.173
I imagine you'll keep
getting on just fine.

29:00.173 --> 29:02.523
I just wonder when
you're gonna get tired of it.

29:02.523 --> 29:03.872
I'll let you know.

29:03.872 --> 29:06.570
Because you've got an
uncle in federal prison,

29:06.570 --> 29:08.659
another one in Panama.

29:08.659 --> 29:10.792
Napoleon gets high on his
own supply

29:10.792 --> 29:13.012
a little too much
for his own good,

29:13.012 --> 29:17.277
and Kiki's...
just crazy enough

29:17.277 --> 29:19.845
to bring down
the whole operation.

29:19.845 --> 29:22.064
This is your time.

29:22.064 --> 29:23.326
You've
earned it.

29:23.326 --> 29:24.806
You're telling me all this why?

29:24.806 --> 29:27.940
That was one of my cops
that was shot today.

29:27.940 --> 29:30.986
Shot by someone
in a stolen car

29:30.986 --> 29:33.815
and I think that
someone was Kiki.

29:33.815 --> 29:35.817
Why do you think that?

29:35.817 --> 29:38.733
Because the person who stole
the car was paid in dope.

29:38.733 --> 29:42.389
That dope was packaged
identically like the dope

29:42.389 --> 29:44.043
that your family deals.

29:44.043 --> 29:45.740
That don't mean it was Kiki.

29:45.740 --> 29:48.569
Kiki's less than a year
younger than Napoleon.

29:48.569 --> 29:49.962
I remember from my
time in Narcotics

29:49.962 --> 29:51.746
he was loyal
to Napoleon

29:51.746 --> 29:53.139
and a little bit crazy.

29:54.183 --> 29:55.837
You think I'm gonna give him up?

29:55.837 --> 29:58.666
It depends how long you want
to keep getting passed over.

29:58.666 --> 30:01.538
Because you're older
than your brothers.

30:01.538 --> 30:03.279
You're way more sophisticated.

30:04.541 --> 30:06.674
Has anyone ever thought
about giving you a shot?

30:06.674 --> 30:07.762
You?

30:09.068 --> 30:10.373
That's not how it works.

30:10.373 --> 30:13.202
This isn't some law of nature.

30:13.202 --> 30:14.725
Your brothers made it that way.

30:16.205 --> 30:17.990
Where'd you get
all this insight into my family?

30:17.990 --> 30:20.906
I interviewed your
father before he died.

30:20.906 --> 30:24.039
He wanted you to run
the family business.

30:24.039 --> 30:25.345
You.

30:26.563 --> 30:28.043
He couldn't have
wanted it that bad.

30:28.043 --> 30:29.479
Otherwise, it would've happened.

30:29.479 --> 30:31.481
By that time he was too sick

30:31.481 --> 30:33.962
and weak and your brothers
didn't care what he wanted.

30:35.616 --> 30:37.183
Cops don't usually take
an interest

30:37.183 --> 30:39.446
in the organization
of my family's business.

30:39.446 --> 30:42.144
I want your brother, Lucia.

30:43.667 --> 30:44.930
And from where
I'm sitting...

30:47.236 --> 30:51.240
...you should be only too happy
to give him up.

30:56.811 --> 30:58.900
No one can know you got
where he is from me.

30:58.900 --> 31:00.336
No one will.

31:01.555 --> 31:02.773

31:20.617 --> 31:22.968
I just got word Sandeford's

31:22.968 --> 31:24.273
How'd he get
the location?

31:24.273 --> 31:26.145
I'm not at liberty
to say.
No, of course not.

31:26.145 --> 31:27.407
I don't mean to hold

- No, no.

31:27.407 --> 31:28.843
No, no, no apologies.

31:30.584 --> 31:33.195

to get it over with.

I don't expect you to.

32:55.625 --> 32:57.976
Tough guy like you.

33:00.326 --> 33:01.980
After all,

33:01.980 --> 33:03.546
you shot a cop
on his lunch break

33:03.546 --> 33:04.895
from a moving car.

33:04.895 --> 33:06.288
They don't get much
tougher than that.

33:06.288 --> 33:08.029
Rules have changed, old man.

33:08.029 --> 33:10.553
- That right?
- You bust into our place,

33:10.553 --> 33:12.077
take my brother prisoner,

33:12.077 --> 33:14.166
and you think
we're just gonna hire a lawyer,

33:16.124 --> 33:17.604
No.

33:17.604 --> 33:20.476
You come at me, I come at you.

33:20.476 --> 33:22.304

punk-ass partner

of yours in a box myself.

33:25.003 --> 33:27.048
And one day,
I'm gonna do the same

33:27.048 --> 33:28.876
thing to you.

33:31.444 --> 33:33.533
You're never gonna
get the chance.

33:48.635 --> 33:50.811
Officer Sandeford,
we know you're in there.

33:53.248 --> 33:55.381
Sandeford!

33:57.078 --> 33:59.428
We're coming
in now, Marvin.

34:07.480 --> 34:09.395
Is he dead?

34:09.395 --> 34:11.266
Very much alive.

34:12.702 --> 34:13.747
He's cuffed to the bed.

34:15.183 --> 34:16.184
I recorded his confession.

34:17.403 --> 34:18.404
Where's the gun?

34:30.329 --> 34:33.027
Put him in!

34:46.040 --> 34:47.389
You were thinking
this is just

34:47.389 --> 34:49.304
gonna go away
with a wink and a nod?

34:49.304 --> 34:51.698
I wasn't thinking about it
one way or the other.

34:51.698 --> 34:54.004
Who sent you a text
that it was Santiago, Marvin?

34:54.004 --> 34:56.094
I never got a text
it was Santiago.

34:56.094 --> 34:57.095
Well, how'd you know?

34:58.052 --> 35:00.272
I trained a lot of cops, Chief.

35:01.664 --> 35:03.144
Something about this one
was different,

35:03.144 --> 35:04.885
seeing him get cut down
like that...

35:04.885 --> 35:07.322
So you decided to go rogue,
in other words.

35:07.322 --> 35:08.715
I guess that's one word
you could use for it.

35:08.715 --> 35:09.890
One of the kinder ones.

35:11.587 --> 35:12.980
And what would you have done
in my place?

35:12.980 --> 35:15.113
I would've abided by
departmental regulations.

35:15.113 --> 35:17.071
Come on, man,
we were in Anti-Crime together.

35:17.071 --> 35:18.768
I know the kind of cop you were.

35:18.768 --> 35:20.727
Your union delegate isn't going
to make this go away, Marvin.

35:20.727 --> 35:22.685
Consequences.

35:22.685 --> 35:24.165
There's going to be
consequences behind this.

35:24.165 --> 35:25.297
What we talking?
We talking about

35:25.297 --> 35:26.602
loss of vacation days, suspension?

35:26.602 --> 35:27.777
I don't know
what's gonna happen.

35:27.777 --> 35:29.431
But I wouldn't
depend on

35:29.431 --> 35:32.608
the unconditional support
of the people you work for.

35:32.608 --> 35:34.784
I don't, Chief.

35:34.784 --> 35:36.482
I never have.

35:47.884 --> 35:49.147
Okay, let's go.

36:04.205 --> 36:07.121
Turns out Sandeford decided
against killing Kiki on his own.

36:07.121 --> 36:08.427
Mm.

36:08.427 --> 36:11.386
Well, based on the way
he was when I saw him,

36:11.386 --> 36:13.823
man, that could've
gone either way.

36:13.823 --> 36:17.349
Anyways, uh, I appreciate
you taking the risk.

36:44.419 --> 36:46.726
I haven't eaten anything
since early this morning.

36:46.726 --> 36:48.336
One of these officers
was nice enough

36:48.336 --> 36:49.859
to get me something
from the cafeteria.

36:49.859 --> 36:53.689
Um, I brought a few
changes of clothes for him.

36:59.391 --> 37:01.001
Is it possible
for me to go see him?

37:02.220 --> 37:04.265
Well, he hasn't woken up yet.

37:04.265 --> 37:06.311
But if you want to go in
for a minute, go ahead.

37:06.311 --> 37:08.226
Thank you.

37:31.466 --> 37:32.641
Hi, Andre.

37:38.908 --> 37:40.475
It's so weird.

37:42.738 --> 37:46.089
Six months ago, I didn't
even know who you were.

37:49.832 --> 37:52.574
So why am I so scared
that I'm gonna lose you?

38:01.714 --> 38:04.238
The night nurse needs
to change his IV.Sure.

38:04.238 --> 38:06.458

would look to look in on him.

38:06.458 --> 38:07.676
Okay.

Hey, Marvin.

38:15.249 --> 38:16.294
Brandy.

38:18.731 --> 38:20.036
Just gonna
be outside.

38:46.062 --> 38:47.325
Quit petting me, man.

38:49.283 --> 38:50.806
I ain't no dog.

38:53.853 --> 38:54.984
How you doing, partner?

38:57.117 --> 38:58.510
How do I look?

38:59.772 --> 39:01.600

You rest up, you do everything

39:11.566 --> 39:12.741
get back to work.

39:14.134 --> 39:15.309
Might be a while.

39:15.309 --> 39:17.355
That's all right.

39:17.355 --> 39:19.879
You'll probably have yourself...

39:19.879 --> 39:22.142
another trainee sitting
in the car by then.

39:22.142 --> 39:25.319
Whoever's sitting in the car,
I'm gonna kick they ass out.

39:27.930 --> 39:29.367
