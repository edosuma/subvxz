WEBVTT

00:03.333 --> 00:06.542
Oh, hey, honey,
don't forget this Saturday night

00:06.625 --> 00:09.500
it's the D.P.C.A.A.D.D.

00:09.583 --> 00:12.291
I thought we agreed you guys would stop
spelling things around me.

00:14.959 --> 00:19.291
It stands for the Denver Pest Control
Association Annual Dinner Dance.

00:19.709 --> 00:21.583
Also known as the Bug Prom.

00:23.291 --> 00:26.291
And this year,
the Duncans will be attending.

00:26.375 --> 00:28.083
Oh, that's right,
you guys didn't go last year

00:28.166 --> 00:29.542
because Toby had just been born.

00:29.625 --> 00:32.166
Shoot! I forgot to have a baby this year.

00:33.959 --> 00:37.041
Oh, come on, honey, we always have
a lot of fun at these things.

00:37.125 --> 00:40.625
Hey, this year,
the theme is Fire-Ant Fiesta.

00:43.333 --> 00:46.583
Bob, honey, do we really have to go?
Yes, we have to go.

00:46.667 --> 00:49.375
I'm kind of a big cheese at the D.P.C.A.

00:50.500 --> 00:52.959
If I don't show up, a lot of people
are going to be disappointed.

00:53.041 --> 00:54.125
That's weird.

00:54.208 --> 00:56.208
Usually, people are disappointed
when you do show up.

00:59.917 --> 01:01.667
Well, we're going to need a babysitter.

01:02.291 --> 01:04.834
Don't look at me. I'm taking Lauren
to see the biggest movie of the year.

01:04.917 --> 01:05.834
Megasquad.

01:05.917 --> 01:08.959
Oh, is that the one about the world's
four greatest super heroes teaming up?

01:09.041 --> 01:12.333
Well, I'm not sure you can call them
the four greatest,

01:12.417 --> 01:15.291
especially since the death
of Eco-Man is now in question.

01:15.375 --> 01:17.875
See, the thing is, if you really want
to understand

01:17.959 --> 01:20.000
the complicated dynamics of Megasquad ,

01:20.125 --> 01:23.208
you have to go back to the formation
of the Assembly of Righteousness.

01:24.166 --> 01:25.917
Hard to believe
he's got a girlfriend, huh?

01:27.208 --> 01:28.041
I can babysit.

01:28.125 --> 01:29.583
I have to make something
for cooking school,

01:29.667 --> 01:30.583
might as well do it here.

01:30.667 --> 01:32.000
All right, great. Then we're all set.

01:32.083 --> 01:35.041
What if someone left a baby
on our doorstep?

01:37.417 --> 01:39.834
Then I wouldn't have to go, right?

01:40.250 --> 01:41.375
We're going.

01:43.542 --> 01:45.208
Oh, poor Mom.

01:45.458 --> 01:48.083
I'm so glad I don't have
to go to those things.

01:48.166 --> 01:49.291
Oh.

01:50.667 --> 01:51.792
Hello?

01:51.875 --> 01:52.917
Oh, hi, Beau.

01:53.542 --> 01:56.083
Yeah, Saturday I'm free.
What do you have in mind?

01:57.500 --> 01:58.458
Oh.

01:58.917 --> 02:01.709
Yeah. Yeah, that sounds fun.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.083
Oh, okay.

02:03.458 --> 02:04.625
Bye.

02:05.291 --> 02:06.542
Going to the Bug Prom?

03:07.125 --> 03:09.542
Going to a bug-themed dance
with my parents?

03:09.625 --> 03:12.125
What girl wouldn't be excited?

03:13.417 --> 03:14.750
Oh, listen.

03:15.375 --> 03:18.542
If it's all right with you,
I'd like to invite my Aunt to come too.

03:19.083 --> 03:21.208
She's been so sweet, you know,
putting me up and all.

03:21.291 --> 03:22.667
Yeah, of course.

03:22.750 --> 03:26.166
I mean, if you want to just take her,
I can bow out.

03:28.458 --> 03:30.375
No way!

03:30.458 --> 03:32.709
My aunt's really looking forward
to meeting you and your parents.

03:32.792 --> 03:35.083
- Really?
- And she's reporting back to my Mom.

03:35.166 --> 03:37.166
So this is kind of a big moment
in our relationship.

03:37.250 --> 03:41.208
Oh, so we, uh,
we have a relationship, huh?

03:41.291 --> 03:42.750
Not if this doesn't go well.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.125
I'm just messing with you.

03:48.667 --> 03:50.083
But really, it does have to go well.

03:59.208 --> 04:00.208
Ugh!

04:01.083 --> 04:02.166
What do you want?

04:03.417 --> 04:05.125
Aren't you going to ask me in?

04:05.709 --> 04:08.333
Well, I guess I should.

04:08.417 --> 04:10.583
You are the grandmother of my girlfriend.

04:12.875 --> 04:15.834
But you are my mortal enemy, so I'm torn.

04:17.291 --> 04:20.375
I'm just here to tell you Lauren can't go
to the movies tomorrow night.

04:20.458 --> 04:23.458
Her dad came into town, and took her
on a camping trip for a few days.

04:23.542 --> 04:27.041
Oh, come on, I already bought the tickets
to see Megasquad .

04:27.125 --> 04:29.583
So you can still go!
I'll even take you and bring you home.

04:30.291 --> 04:31.250
Whoa.

04:32.625 --> 04:33.834
Why are you being nice to me?

04:33.917 --> 04:37.083
Why wouldn't I be nice to the boy
who's taking me to see Megasquad ?

04:40.583 --> 04:41.917
No. No, no way.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
But I want to see it and it's sold out.

04:44.083 --> 04:45.125
And you need a ride.

04:46.166 --> 04:48.166
Why do you want to see Megasquad ?

04:48.250 --> 04:51.417
I started reading the comic books
when I was a little girl.

04:51.500 --> 04:53.458
I even hold issue number 1,

04:53.542 --> 04:56.917
where these words were uttered
for the very first time.

04:57.500 --> 05:01.375
"And on that day,
four heroes joined forces...

05:01.458 --> 05:03.458
Both: and the Megasquad was born."

05:07.667 --> 05:08.750
I'm impressed.

05:09.041 --> 05:11.875
I'm not just the cranky lady
who lives next door.

05:12.291 --> 05:13.542
I've got layers.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
Okay.

05:17.250 --> 05:19.709
All right, I'll let you take me,
but there are going to be some rules.

05:19.792 --> 05:20.625
Like what?

05:20.709 --> 05:24.250
We enter the movie separately,
we don't sit next to each other,

05:24.333 --> 05:27.208
and we never speak to each other
until we get back home.

05:28.583 --> 05:31.125
Far as I'm concerned,
that can start right now.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.041
Oh, I can't believe I have to go shopping
for a Bug Prom.

05:41.750 --> 05:45.083
Well, welcome to the wonderful world
of dating an exterminator.

05:45.750 --> 05:47.917
Tell me all about it. What can I expect?

05:48.000 --> 05:49.291
I don't remember any of them.

05:50.417 --> 05:51.917
I'd go into shut-down mode.

05:52.667 --> 05:54.000
Shut-down mode? What's that?

05:54.083 --> 05:57.458
Well, it's kind of a trance
that I'd put myself into.

05:57.542 --> 06:00.417
It's like I'm there, but I'm not there.

06:00.500 --> 06:01.750
- Mmm.
- Check it out.

06:10.834 --> 06:13.083
Mom, you okay?

06:13.583 --> 06:15.542
Having a wonderful time.

06:16.667 --> 06:19.500
- Mom?
- So nice to be here.

06:20.458 --> 06:21.792
You're... you're scaring me right now.

06:21.875 --> 06:22.750
Mom?

06:23.750 --> 06:25.041
How long was I out?

06:25.667 --> 06:27.667
When do you use that?

06:27.750 --> 06:29.375
Only when I have to.

06:29.458 --> 06:33.166
You know, Mother-in-law visits, jury duty,
school talent shows.

06:33.250 --> 06:34.500
Not yours, though.

06:35.709 --> 06:38.291
Woman over P. A.:
Order number 27 is ready. 27.

06:43.458 --> 06:45.417
- Excuse me, is this seat... ah!
- Ah!

06:46.917 --> 06:49.500
Amy Duncan!

06:50.166 --> 06:54.500
Karen... I-forgot-your-last-name
because-I-don't-like you.

06:56.208 --> 06:58.583
How long has it been?

06:58.667 --> 07:00.166
Not long enough.

07:00.250 --> 07:02.625
- How are things at the hospital?
- Better since you left.

07:03.792 --> 07:05.291
There's no chance
you're coming back, right?

07:05.417 --> 07:06.709
Oh, no, no, no.

07:06.792 --> 07:08.041
Not as long as you're there.

07:08.125 --> 07:10.917
In fact, I'm crossing this mall
off my list too.

07:12.166 --> 07:16.041
I'd say it was a pleasure seeing you,
but clearly, it wasn't.

07:20.208 --> 07:21.083
Who was that?

07:21.166 --> 07:24.250
My least-favorite person
in the world. Karen.

07:24.875 --> 07:28.500
Wait, that's the Queen of Darkness,
Empress of Evil, Princess of Pain?

07:29.792 --> 07:32.000
Honey, you remembered. That's so sweet.

07:38.709 --> 07:40.583
Excuse me. Oh, excuse me.

07:41.583 --> 07:42.458
Excuse me.

07:42.542 --> 07:44.542
Woo!

07:44.625 --> 07:47.542
What are you doing?
We agreed not to sit together.

07:47.625 --> 07:49.000
This is the last seat.

07:49.917 --> 07:52.250
I told you you should have driven faster.

07:52.291 --> 07:54.625
- No, you didn't.
- I was thinking it.

07:54.709 --> 07:56.458
I was honoring our no-talking policy.

08:01.375 --> 08:04.041
And then they lived happily ever after.

08:05.166 --> 08:06.917
Not a surprise ending,
but at least we're done.

08:07.709 --> 08:10.625
Okay! Bedtime!

08:11.041 --> 08:12.333
Good night, Toby.

08:12.417 --> 08:14.166
Charlie, it's your bedtime too.

08:14.250 --> 08:15.542
No, it isn't.

08:15.625 --> 08:16.959
Yes, it is.

08:17.041 --> 08:18.542
Mama said I could stay up.

08:18.625 --> 08:19.750
No, she didn't.

08:19.834 --> 08:21.000
Yes, she did.

08:22.375 --> 08:26.083
Okay, we'll just, uh,
we'll see about this.

08:28.917 --> 08:30.542
Hi, Mommy, it's PJ.

08:30.625 --> 08:31.709
Should Charlie go to bed?

08:33.417 --> 08:35.291
Yeah, that's what I thought. Okay.

08:38.041 --> 08:39.083
What's that, Mommy?

08:39.166 --> 08:40.875
Why is my phone ringing
while I'm talking to you?

08:40.959 --> 08:42.417
Well, that's a good question.

08:42.542 --> 08:44.417
Uh, I'll tell you later.

08:44.500 --> 08:45.792
Bye, Mommy.

08:50.917 --> 08:55.333
Announcer: The funniest comedy
of the winter is coming this summer!

08:55.417 --> 08:57.792
It's Whacky Train!

08:57.875 --> 09:02.000
What? Whacky Train ?

09:02.083 --> 09:05.625
Must be a sequel to Whacky Bus !
I love Whacky Bus !

09:06.417 --> 09:09.083
Announcer: From the makers of Whacky Bus!

09:09.166 --> 09:10.375
Called it!

09:12.542 --> 09:15.458
Oh! The conductor's pants fell down!

09:15.542 --> 09:17.709
It's funny because you don't expect it!

09:18.375 --> 09:19.250
See?

09:25.041 --> 09:26.583
Hey, what's all this?

09:26.667 --> 09:28.667
I'm gonna bake too.

09:28.750 --> 09:31.291
In your Speedy Bake Oven?
Isn't that adorable?

09:31.375 --> 09:34.041
- You wanna be just like your big brother?
- Not really.

09:37.583 --> 09:40.291
Now listen, Charlie.

09:40.375 --> 09:43.417
I'm gonna be making
a very complicated French dish.

09:43.542 --> 09:47.208
And you're going to be making something
in a plastic box with a light bulb.

09:47.750 --> 09:50.208
So when we taste ours later,

09:50.291 --> 09:52.041
I don't want you to get sad
if mine tastes better.

09:52.125 --> 09:54.291
- Okay.
- It's not a competition.

09:55.667 --> 09:58.417
Okay, let's get you started.

10:00.083 --> 10:01.083
Here we go.

10:01.792 --> 10:04.000
That's good, that's good.
You gotta mix it all, though.

10:04.083 --> 10:05.375
I don't need help.

10:06.083 --> 10:07.208
Okay. Yeah.

10:07.709 --> 10:09.625
I'll just get started on my dish then.

10:10.417 --> 10:14.834
Okay, step one, separate the eggs.

10:15.583 --> 10:17.792
Why, are they going to get into a fight
with the baking powder?

10:19.625 --> 10:20.959
Do you need help?

10:34.792 --> 10:36.792
Say what you want about exterminators,

10:36.875 --> 10:38.792
but we know how to party.

10:38.875 --> 10:43.291
What's on those tables?
Are those stuffed squirrels?

10:45.125 --> 10:46.333
Sure are.

10:46.417 --> 10:47.458
We bring them to every party.

10:47.542 --> 10:48.917
We just change their little hats.

10:49.458 --> 10:51.500
Oh, hey, there's Murray!

10:51.583 --> 10:54.083
Come on, honey, I want to go brag
about my new bee fogger.

10:54.166 --> 10:57.083
Oh, yeah, be right there!

10:57.709 --> 10:58.875
Time for shut-down mode.

10:58.959 --> 11:00.250
See you in three hours.

11:03.750 --> 11:06.417
Uh-oh, I'm still here. Ha.

11:07.250 --> 11:09.500
Okay, no need to panic.
I'll just try it again.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.917
What? I don't understand.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.667
I'm... I'm still here.

11:17.750 --> 11:19.291
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.

11:19.375 --> 11:21.000
This has never happened before.

11:21.458 --> 11:25.291
Bob: Amy, you gotta see this!
Murray got bit by a spider.

11:25.667 --> 11:27.834
Honey, come on, it's oozing!

11:29.542 --> 11:32.375
Sweet Mama! I'm at the Bug Prom.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.333
Your Mom's kind of, uh, different.

11:39.417 --> 11:41.917
Just scratching the surface.

11:44.291 --> 11:46.792
- So, do you see your Aunt?
- No.

11:47.250 --> 11:48.542
She should be here soon, though.

11:48.625 --> 11:51.000
- She's coming straight from work.
- Where does she work?

11:51.083 --> 11:52.875
Southwest Denver County Hospital.

11:52.959 --> 11:55.375
No way! That's where my Mom used to work.

11:55.458 --> 11:57.625
- She was a nurse.
- So is my Aunt.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.959
No way! You know what would be nuts?

12:01.041 --> 12:02.166
Beau!

12:03.125 --> 12:04.542
Aunt Karen.

12:06.166 --> 12:07.667
That would be nuts.

12:15.875 --> 12:19.792
Ah, Aunt Karen,
I'd like you to meet Teddy.

12:20.250 --> 12:21.792
Oh, hello, Teddy.

12:21.875 --> 12:24.375
I have heard so much about you.

12:24.458 --> 12:26.291
I've heard so much about you...

12:26.750 --> 12:29.000
from so many different sources.

12:30.041 --> 12:31.083
Okay.

12:31.834 --> 12:33.667
Uh, where are your parents?

12:33.750 --> 12:34.750
I can't wait to meet them.

12:34.875 --> 12:36.417
Uh, no, they're not here right now.

12:36.500 --> 12:39.041
They had to attend to a little crisis.

12:39.125 --> 12:43.083
Um, one of the squirrels
lost his little hat.

12:44.458 --> 12:47.166
I don't want to bore you
with the details, but...

12:47.500 --> 12:49.083
You seem a little jumpy.

12:49.166 --> 12:50.792
Oh, no, no, no. I'm always like this.

12:50.875 --> 12:53.083
You just haven't met me,
so you don't know.

12:54.417 --> 12:55.834
I know!

12:55.917 --> 12:58.959
You need to hurry up
and grab your raffle ticket now.

12:59.041 --> 13:02.625
They're being sold
by the guy dressed as a dung beetle.

13:02.709 --> 13:04.125
Oh, at least, I hope it's a guy.

13:04.208 --> 13:06.041
Otherwise, we're all in trouble.

13:06.500 --> 13:08.166
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Yeah.

13:08.250 --> 13:09.208
Run along now.

13:09.291 --> 13:12.166
- Go, go, go!
- Jumpy and pushy.

13:14.208 --> 13:16.917
- What's up with you?
- We have a situation here.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
Your Aunt and my Mom hate each other.

13:19.083 --> 13:20.291
- They do?
- Yeah.

13:20.375 --> 13:23.417
They used to work together,
and now they're arch enemies.

13:26.500 --> 13:28.000
Hey, guys, how you doing?

13:28.083 --> 13:29.291
How do you think I'm doing?

13:29.417 --> 13:31.291
I'm alert and aware of my surroundings.

13:32.458 --> 13:34.458
We're having an awesome time.

13:34.542 --> 13:37.542
- Hey, where's that aunt of yours?
- Oh, uh, not here yet.

13:37.625 --> 13:39.750
Oh. All right, honey,
let's go buy a raffle ticket.

13:39.875 --> 13:40.792
No.

13:41.166 --> 13:43.834
You're going to have to do that later.
There's a big line.

13:43.917 --> 13:46.333
Everybody wants to take a picture
with the dung beetle.

13:47.417 --> 13:49.000
Saw that one coming.

13:49.917 --> 13:50.750
What?

13:55.542 --> 13:57.917
Man 1: If you don't come up with the code
in the next 30 seconds,

13:58.000 --> 13:59.625
the planet is doomed!

13:59.709 --> 14:01.083
Man 2: You don't think I know that?

14:01.166 --> 14:03.500
Just let me think, man. Let me think.

14:03.583 --> 14:05.792
Come on!
The code is your daughter's birthday!

14:05.875 --> 14:06.709
All: Shh!

14:06.792 --> 14:08.291
I read about that on the Internet.

14:08.417 --> 14:10.291
Shh!

14:10.375 --> 14:12.417
Man 1: There's only one thing
that can save us now.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.041
Megasquad, where are you?

14:15.125 --> 14:17.166
All: Aw!

14:17.250 --> 14:19.792
Hey, we're trying to watch
a movie here, people!

14:19.875 --> 14:21.041
Whose phone is that?

14:21.125 --> 14:23.083
It's yours!

14:23.834 --> 14:25.834
Oops! My bad.

14:27.458 --> 14:29.542
Hello? Hi, Virginia.

14:29.625 --> 14:31.250
Oh, I can't talk now. I'm in a movie.

14:31.875 --> 14:34.250
I'm in a movie! I can't talk!

14:34.959 --> 14:37.750
Hey, tell your date to be quiet.

14:37.875 --> 14:39.083
She's not my date.

14:39.166 --> 14:40.875
Yeah, well, whoever she is,
tell her to zip it.

14:40.959 --> 14:41.917
You zip it.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.792
Oh, Virginia, I gotta go!

14:43.875 --> 14:45.709
They're about to capture
the President's daughter!

14:47.041 --> 14:48.792
Unbelievable!

14:48.875 --> 14:51.250
Will you please shut
your big mouth, old lady?

14:51.291 --> 14:53.291
Okay, okay, that is it.

14:53.417 --> 14:55.834
She may be old,
but nobody calls her a lady!

14:58.458 --> 15:00.542
You got something to say to her,
you can say it to me.

15:00.875 --> 15:02.542
Right after I'm done talking
to this usher.

15:02.625 --> 15:03.583
Yes?

15:04.834 --> 15:06.208
Let's go. You're out of here.

15:06.291 --> 15:08.667
Me? She's the one causing
all the problems.

15:08.750 --> 15:10.583
- Yeah, well, she's coming too.
- What?

15:10.667 --> 15:12.291
- What did I do?
- Come on.

15:13.333 --> 15:16.333
Good riddance!

15:18.750 --> 15:20.500
The President is a clone.

15:29.458 --> 15:30.917
It looks funny.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.583
Oh, well, looks can be deceiving.

15:37.625 --> 15:39.208
They can also be disgusting.

15:40.083 --> 15:41.834
Oh! Charlie, what am I going to do?

15:42.583 --> 15:44.458
I have to bring something
into class tomorrow.

15:44.542 --> 15:46.542
- Try mine.
- Okay.

15:48.333 --> 15:49.166
Uh-huh.

15:53.375 --> 15:54.625
Charlie, this is really good.

15:55.458 --> 15:56.875
I can make you one.

15:57.750 --> 16:00.458
That's very sweet,
but that's not how it works.

16:00.542 --> 16:02.083
See, I have to make it myself.

16:02.166 --> 16:03.917
A chef is nothing without integrity.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.083
- I won't tell.
- Good enough.

16:11.542 --> 16:13.500
I don't know how much longer
I can stall my Aunt.

16:13.583 --> 16:16.542
- She keeps asking about your parents.
- Fine, okay.

16:16.625 --> 16:20.834
Um, she wants to meet some parents?
Let's introduce her to some parents.

16:21.792 --> 16:23.125
Hi, I'm Teddy.

16:23.208 --> 16:26.458
- And you are?
- Jerry and Phyllis Graber. How are ya?

16:26.542 --> 16:30.917
Jerry, Phyllis, how would you guys like
to make a little extra cash?

16:31.000 --> 16:32.458
What would we have to do?

16:32.542 --> 16:35.083
Who cares?
We're living on an exterminator's salary.

16:35.166 --> 16:36.333
We're in.

16:37.709 --> 16:39.542
Karen? Hi.

16:39.917 --> 16:44.375
I'd like you to meet my mom and dad,
this is Bob and Annie.

16:44.834 --> 16:48.000
- This is Karen.
- Oh, so you're Teddy's parents?

16:48.083 --> 16:50.667
Well, they're definitely not
a couple of strangers.

16:53.583 --> 16:56.917
So nice to finally meet you.

16:57.041 --> 16:58.125
Yeah, Bob, I know what you do.

16:58.208 --> 16:59.375
Annie, how about you?

16:59.458 --> 17:02.083
I just enjoy being Betty's mom.

17:03.792 --> 17:04.750
Betty?

17:05.291 --> 17:06.750
I thought your name was Teddy.

17:07.834 --> 17:10.458
Betty is her middle name.

17:10.959 --> 17:13.583
Yup, that's right. That's me.

17:13.667 --> 17:15.667
I'm Teddy Betty.

17:17.959 --> 17:22.291
Yeah, the, uh, the missus and I
argued long and hard about that one.

17:23.208 --> 17:24.583
Boy, did we.

17:25.709 --> 17:27.417
Said old Bobby Robby!

17:27.500 --> 17:30.000
I think you're picking up
on our theme here.

17:31.291 --> 17:33.166
Yeah, the rhyming names. Got it.

17:33.250 --> 17:36.083
- I was wondering if--
- Oh, you know what?

17:36.166 --> 17:39.667
They still haven't gotten their picture
with the dung beetle.

17:39.750 --> 17:41.917
So we'll, uh, we'll see you later.

17:43.125 --> 17:45.000
It was very nice to meet you.

17:46.208 --> 17:47.500
Jerry, good job.

17:47.583 --> 17:51.000
Phyllis, gotta say,
I'm a little disappointed.

17:51.083 --> 17:53.333
Hey, don't talk
to your fake mother like that.

17:58.333 --> 18:00.417
Thank you for a terrible evening.

18:00.500 --> 18:01.333
Gabe, wait.

18:01.417 --> 18:03.125
There's something I want to say.

18:03.542 --> 18:05.458
Wouldn't you rather yell it at a screen?

18:08.250 --> 18:11.500
Back there at the movie,
you kind of stood up for me.

18:12.000 --> 18:15.417
I guess I'd like to say
I somewhat appreciate that.

18:17.208 --> 18:20.125
Well, you're sort of welcome.

18:20.959 --> 18:23.458
- I only ask one thing from you.
- What's that?

18:23.542 --> 18:26.166
That you never mention to anyone
that I defended you.

18:26.250 --> 18:27.250
I promise.

18:28.208 --> 18:29.041
Not good enough.

18:29.125 --> 18:30.458
Swear by the Mega Code.

18:32.125 --> 18:36.959
I do swear with honor,
integrity, fidelity...

18:37.041 --> 18:39.375
Both: Megasquad forever! Hoo-rah!

18:42.959 --> 18:44.750
- Let's not mention that part either.
- Hmm.

18:49.667 --> 18:53.000
Okay, fun lovers,
it's time for the last dance.

18:53.083 --> 18:57.250
So come on, everybody, let's get out on
the dance floor and shake your thorax!

18:59.625 --> 19:02.375
For you non-pros, that is your booty!

19:04.083 --> 19:06.542
Honey?

19:08.208 --> 19:09.291
Uh-oh.

19:10.333 --> 19:12.000
Come on, we've got to keep them apart.

19:16.333 --> 19:17.750
Oh.

19:17.834 --> 19:20.166
- May I cut in?
- Um, no thanks.

19:20.250 --> 19:22.166
Oh, you dance with your dad.

19:22.250 --> 19:24.417
- Ha-ha!
- Oh, hey!

19:25.709 --> 19:28.375
Why is Teddy dancing with Jerry Graber?

19:32.917 --> 19:34.750
- You!
- You!

19:48.917 --> 19:50.000
Ha! Hey!

19:55.250 --> 19:56.709
Oh!

19:59.250 --> 20:01.166
Yeah?

20:03.375 --> 20:05.375
- Dad, do something.
- No, no, no.

20:05.458 --> 20:07.458
I got two rules when it comes to your Mom.

20:07.542 --> 20:08.875
Never try and get the last word,

20:08.959 --> 20:11.834
and never interrupt her
in the middle of a dance-off.

20:33.792 --> 20:35.583
Charlie, good news.

20:35.667 --> 20:37.291
I got an A on my cake.

20:37.375 --> 20:39.041
Yay!

20:39.125 --> 20:43.083
Chef said it was light, tasty,
and displayed a childlike simplicity.

20:43.166 --> 20:44.417
You're welcome.

20:45.291 --> 20:47.083
I need you to clear your schedule
this weekend.

20:47.166 --> 20:48.375
We're making Beef Wellington.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.959
I'm going to need a bigger light bulb.

20:58.417 --> 20:59.500
Hey, Charlie.

20:59.583 --> 21:03.834
Well, I made it through my first Bug Prom.

21:04.959 --> 21:09.834
And today, I finally told Mom
that Karen is Beau's Aunt.

21:09.917 --> 21:12.166
And she took it surprisingly well.

21:18.583 --> 21:20.333
Having a wonderful time.

21:22.875 --> 21:25.542
Because she rediscovered shut-down mode.

21:27.083 --> 21:31.083
Honey, honey, great news!
We won the raffle.

21:31.166 --> 21:33.208
We're going on a Bug Cruise!

21:35.792 --> 21:37.291
So nice to be here.

21:40.750 --> 21:42.291
Another day in paradise.

21:42.917 --> 21:44.166
Good luck, Charlie.

21:47.959 --> 21:51.083
Man: There's one thing
you didn't count on, Professor Ice.

21:51.750 --> 21:54.875
And that's the Human Tornado!

21:55.458 --> 21:57.750
That tornado's full of water!
He's going to freeze you!

21:59.083 --> 22:00.750
Told ya!

22:00.834 --> 22:03.625
Would you keep it down?
You're driving everybody crazy.

22:03.709 --> 22:05.333
Bob: Yeah, especially me.

22:05.417 --> 22:07.750
Do you mind?
I'm trying to save the world here.

22:08.500 --> 22:10.834
I paid my 12 bucks.
I'll talk if I want to.

22:11.041 --> 22:12.375
Oh, we'll see about that.

22:18.834 --> 22:19.834
I warned you.

22:23.750 --> 22:25.834
Thank you, thank you.

22:25.917 --> 22:27.667
Excuse me? Uh, Tornado?

22:27.750 --> 22:32.375
Not to be a stickler, but it has not been
established that you can zap people.

22:33.375 --> 22:35.625
Does this establish it?

22:39.250 --> 22:41.750
Anyone else care to join the logic police?

22:43.125 --> 22:45.458
You? You?
