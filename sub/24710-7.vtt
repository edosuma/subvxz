00:29.863 --> 00:32.907
Elderly couple that owns the shop
got beaten and robbed when they opened up.

00:33.575 --> 00:37.203
Next-door neighbor here heard a commotion,
saw two Black males run up Canal Street.

00:37.370 --> 00:38.413
What shape's the couple in?

00:38.580 --> 00:40.623
The old guy's beat up pretty good,
but he's conscious.

00:57.307 --> 01:01.603
I heard yelling and... and noise,
uh, coming from the shop.

01:02.187 --> 01:06.941
I looked out my window, and I saw
two colored boys running that direction.

01:07.025 --> 01:09.152
What did they look like, ma'am?
Anything distinctive?

01:09.235 --> 01:11.821
One of them looked bigger than the other.

01:11.988 --> 01:15.992
They both wore those floppy clothes
the kids wear now.

-Sure happy to give you a hand.
-Here's the DOA's pedigree.

27:47.123 --> 27:48.333
GREG: Fine.

27:58.510 --> 28:01.846
So, should I keep talking to you
like I'm the bartender?

28:02.639 --> 28:03.932
You are the bartender.

28:06.226 --> 28:07.268
(DOOR OPENING)

28:12.357 --> 28:15.193
-I just wanna see Tina.
-Don't expect me to 86 you, Todd.

28:15.276 --> 28:17.946
I'm not in a position at the moment
to loan 86 to anyone.

28:25.995 --> 28:27.122
What's goin' on?

28:28.039 --> 28:29.457
Exactly what I told you, Todd.

28:29.666 --> 28:32.836
-They're talking about arresting me.
-If you wanna go to Florida,

28:33.461 --> 28:34.546
I got the money to go.

28:35.338 --> 28:38.299
Todd, I think you were involved
in what happened with Ross.

28:38.466 --> 28:39.884
TODD: It's very simple.

28:41.010 --> 28:43.596
I'll do whatever I have to
to take care of you.

28:44.347 --> 28:46.766
Now, can we walk outta here?

28:47.058 --> 28:49.936
Will they let us,
or do I have to take other steps?

28:50.437 --> 28:54.733
-'Cause... I got my gun, Tina.
-Oh, great. You've got a gun?

28:54.899 --> 28:55.942
TODD: What's your problem?

28:56.276 --> 28:58.278
TINA: Why am I gonna go to Florida
with you, Todd?

28:58.361 --> 29:00.989
So, I can watch you smoke meth
and wave your new gun around? Huh?

29:02.031 --> 29:03.199
-JAMES: It's over.
-Relax.

29:03.533 --> 29:04.617
DIANE: Iâ€™ve got the gun.

29:04.868 --> 29:07.245
-What? Tina!
-(SOBS) Screw you, Todd!

29:07.912 --> 29:08.913
Screw you!

29:09.789 --> 29:11.791
He would've taken care of me.

29:12.375 --> 29:15.003
He would've taken care of me.

29:16.296 --> 29:19.299
(SOBBING)

29:27.140 --> 29:28.850
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

29:45.867 --> 29:46.910
How'd you do?

29:49.329 --> 29:52.123
He went. He just wrote up a statement.

29:53.291 --> 29:54.834
So, should we close the deal with Delray?

29:55.502 --> 29:59.214
Those fish in the bottom there,
those are Aeneas catfish.

29:59.756 --> 30:00.757
Oh, yeah?

30:01.132 --> 30:04.469
Them eating the food that drops past
the other fish at the bottom of the tank

30:04.552 --> 30:06.596
is what makes it so my water don't go bad.

30:07.096 --> 30:10.975
The big, ugly one sucking the glass
on the side of the tank is a costemus.

30:11.059 --> 30:14.729
He eats the algae off the glass
and the rocks. (CHUCKLES)

30:15.355 --> 30:18.900
Hard as it is to believe,
keeping the tank right for the fish

30:18.983 --> 30:22.111
is less a pain in the balls
than adjusting for the plants.

30:22.737 --> 30:26.199
I gotta keep adjusting the water pH,
and the light has to be just right.

30:26.449 --> 30:28.660
I never realized it was that complicated.

30:28.868 --> 30:31.788
It isn't complicated
as long as you keep up with it.

30:32.330 --> 30:34.707
You stay in tune,
you're willing to adjust,

30:34.833 --> 30:37.836
then you keep a healthy tank.
You keep a healthy tank,

30:37.961 --> 30:39.254
and you can call yourself a guy

30:39.337 --> 30:40.630
-that knows fish.
-(LID CLOSING)

30:43.550 --> 30:44.968
You follow me, Danny?

30:46.052 --> 30:47.095
Not completely.

30:48.263 --> 30:52.684
You stayed attuned in that interview.
Something came up, and you adjusted.

30:53.142 --> 30:55.687
That kept a healthy tank,
and things went forward.

30:58.022 --> 30:59.190
You adjusted, too.

31:01.234 --> 31:02.277
(CLEARS THROAT)

31:03.486 --> 31:05.989
My various shortcomings... (SIGHS)

31:07.240 --> 31:09.367
I know how to handle a tank.

31:15.206 --> 31:17.542
So, should we tell Delray the good news?

31:20.253 --> 31:22.297
That's the guy
you had that mystery conversation with

31:22.380 --> 31:24.132
-the other day.
-Dornan. Yeah.

31:24.841 --> 31:27.468
The only mystery is how much making
a dope out of myself

31:27.552 --> 31:29.888
I let my wife intimidate myself into.

31:30.805 --> 31:32.265
You want me to wait on Delray?

31:32.891 --> 31:34.809
No. You close him on your own.

31:35.852 --> 31:37.186
I'll catch him with my net.

31:38.146 --> 31:39.772
ANDY: Don't crack wise about fish.

31:40.356 --> 31:41.482
No offense.

31:47.488 --> 31:49.949
-How's it goin', Sarge?
-Doin' fine, kid.

31:51.117 --> 31:53.161
-What's going on, Dornan?
-You got a minute?

31:53.703 --> 31:56.289
We gonna have another
frank exchange of views?

32:06.883 --> 32:08.843
I got no apologies.
Either for how I worked

32:08.927 --> 32:11.763
that Suarez case
your wife got you nosin' around on

32:12.055 --> 32:14.599
or for not confusing you
with somebody I can trust.

32:15.016 --> 32:18.311
So, this blood-brother ceremony
I was gonna invite you to,

32:18.394 --> 32:19.896
I should put that on hold?

32:20.688 --> 32:22.148
So, going over it in my mind...

32:23.274 --> 32:24.734
and making no apologies.

32:24.817 --> 32:26.736
Maybe there's something
to what's got your wife worried.

32:26.861 --> 32:28.905
That Suarez was locked up
for something he didn't do.

32:29.072 --> 32:33.117
-I'm not saying he shouldn't be locked up.
-Hey, I told Sylvia, most of these guys,

32:33.201 --> 32:35.536
even if they weren't guilty
on what they're locked up for,

32:35.620 --> 32:37.497
they should still be in there
for 40 things

32:37.580 --> 32:38.748
that we didn't catch them on.

32:38.957 --> 32:41.209
All I'm saying is,
going back over it in my mind,

32:41.334 --> 32:44.087
Suarez might have given it up to me
a little quick.

32:44.295 --> 32:45.546
-He might have.
-DORNAN: Yeah.

32:45.755 --> 32:47.173
You can get 'em to give it up
a little quick,

32:47.256 --> 32:48.841
but they're usually full of remorse.

32:49.258 --> 32:52.053
-That's absolutely right.
-Which Suarez wasn't.

32:54.472 --> 32:58.643
So, goin' back over it in my mind...
I remember something kept pulling at me,

32:58.726 --> 33:01.854
you know, like it was arthritis
right down in my hip.

33:02.480 --> 33:04.273
But all the other pieces added up.

33:06.275 --> 33:09.654
Listen, your wife might be right
Suarez saying what he is.

33:11.114 --> 33:12.657
Maybe it's worth another look.

33:15.034 --> 33:16.411
You're a good cop, Dornan.

33:17.954 --> 33:20.081
Oh. Now, I know it's true.

33:23.334 --> 33:24.502
(TODD SIGHING)

33:32.135 --> 33:34.303
-He's not gonna confess.
-Mm-mm.

33:34.387 --> 33:37.932
And then the ballistics will come in
on the bullet that killed this big shot,

33:38.057 --> 33:39.642
and they'll match Todd's gun.

33:40.018 --> 33:42.270
And then you know
who's gonna get the credit.

33:42.353 --> 33:43.479
Oh, yeah.

33:44.480 --> 33:45.481
(DIANE SIGHING)

33:46.441 --> 33:49.152
-Who?
-Nothing. Doesn't matter.

33:49.485 --> 33:54.032
You mean somebody else
is gonna get credit for solving this

33:54.115 --> 33:55.616
instead of you two?

33:56.534 --> 33:58.202
Got a lot more power than we do.

33:58.578 --> 34:01.497
Depends what you mean by power.
We do the heavy lifting.

34:01.956 --> 34:05.126
-Mm-hmm.
-If I killed this guy or not...

34:06.377 --> 34:08.171
you act like you're bigger
than other people,

34:08.254 --> 34:10.048
and you will get cut down to size.

34:10.214 --> 34:14.010
-Ross acted that way toward you?
-Oh, his name was Ross?

34:14.844 --> 34:17.263
I thought his name was midget dick.

34:17.847 --> 34:20.141
(SCOFFS) I thought
his name was the angry inch.

34:22.727 --> 34:24.979
(CHUCKLES)

34:29.734 --> 34:33.071
Ladies, I'm gonna make your day.

34:33.321 --> 34:36.908
I killed Ross,
and Iâ€™m confessing that to you personally.

34:37.033 --> 34:38.785
(LAUGHS)

34:50.463 --> 34:54.133
This is a big test for me, Delray.
It's a character builder.

34:55.968 --> 34:57.637
Having Terry's confession...

34:59.722 --> 35:01.641
seeing your good veins there
to take the syringe,

35:01.724 --> 35:03.017
put the poison into you.

35:05.686 --> 35:07.313
I'd like to leave it right here.

35:09.857 --> 35:11.943
But I gotta give you a chance
to beat the needle.

35:12.235 --> 35:14.612
You ain't givin' me nothin'
you don't wanna give me.

35:15.530 --> 35:18.866
Much as I wanna cave your head in
for what you did to them people...

35:20.201 --> 35:23.996
I need to remember I got a job
where I can try to help the weaker.

35:25.498 --> 35:28.459
And doing what I'd like to do to you
would cost me my position.

35:30.545 --> 35:33.089
So, meeting my professional
requirements, Delray,

35:33.506 --> 35:37.718
I'm telling you, with Terry confessing,
leaving him the only one on record,

35:37.802 --> 35:40.012
is you signing your death warrant.

35:41.264 --> 35:43.266
I gotta be straight about that as a cop.

35:48.646 --> 35:49.772
Well, I was there.

35:51.065 --> 35:52.150
All right?

35:53.192 --> 35:56.404
I was in the store with Terry,
but he did all the violence.

36:02.201 --> 36:04.829
So, you know what corroboration is,
douchebag?

36:06.455 --> 36:09.500
A confession from a participant
like Terry give me,

36:09.625 --> 36:12.295
unless I get some outside piece
of corroboration,

36:12.587 --> 36:14.088
the DA won't go to bat.

36:14.797 --> 36:18.801
You putting yourself on the scene
corroborates Terry's statement, Delray.

36:19.343 --> 36:20.428
I got you, you prick.

36:20.511 --> 36:22.805
I put myself on the scene,
not doin' nothing.

36:22.889 --> 36:23.931
-You get up.
-(DELRAY GRUNTING)

36:24.140 --> 36:26.475

who did what in that shop.

36:26.601 --> 36:28.519
I'm sayin' to you
I do nothin' to those people.

36:28.936 --> 36:31.189
-I'm declarin' myself innocent.
-Yeah. Stay with that.

36:31.272 --> 36:35.026
Any more will make you look better,
and I want you looking as bad as you are.

36:43.034 --> 36:44.744
-(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
-How are you handling Dolores?

37:09.518 --> 37:11.229
When she was saying
she hated working here

37:11.312 --> 37:14.190
-because people appreciated her...
-Oh. I know.

37:14.315 --> 37:17.818
-I felt so bad for her.
-Yeah. Iâ€™ve been in that place.

37:19.695 --> 37:22.740
Down on yourself so bad
you can't stand anyone liking you.

37:23.491 --> 37:25.368
Strange we never ran into each other.

37:29.038 --> 37:31.165
Seems like Andy's got a handle
on this stuff,

37:31.457 --> 37:35.169
-keeping things in perspective.
-Oh, yeah. We call Andy the Buddha.

37:35.836 --> 37:38.506
We touch his tummy mornings
so his calm will rub off.

This second guy on Andy's and my case
that beat up them old people...

37:49.725 --> 37:51.269
I got corroboration out of him.

37:52.144 --> 37:53.271
Good.

37:54.146 --> 37:56.941
Yeah. He didn't go,
but he put himself there.

37:57.066 --> 38:00.361
Oh, that's all you need for the DA
to go to bat.

38:01.195 --> 38:02.697
Yeah. That's all I needed from that prick.

38:11.122 --> 38:12.915
Anyways, I got a date.

38:14.750 --> 38:16.419
-Goodnight.
-Night.

38:16.919 --> 38:18.004
Night.

38:26.304 --> 38:30.224
-He takes it to heart.
-Yeah. He'll probably be pretty good.

38:32.059 --> 38:34.979
(LAUGHS) I almost said,
don't get home too late.

-Where's Theo?

-SYLVIA: My father's.
-Have we got something to do?

39:09.930 --> 39:12.600
SYLVIA: No. I just took the baby
to my father's, Andy.

39:14.018 --> 39:17.063
Anyways,
maybe I got a happy surprise for you

39:17.146 --> 39:19.148
on this, uh... the Suarez thing.

39:19.857 --> 39:21.650
You know... you know, this Suarez thing

39:21.776 --> 39:23.569
where you asked me
to talk with Bill Dornan?

39:24.070 --> 39:25.863
After what he told me the other day,

39:26.030 --> 39:27.990
now, Dornan shows back up
at the squad,

39:28.074 --> 39:30.034
like, an hour or so ago, and he says,

39:30.159 --> 39:32.912
"Your wife may be entirely correct there,
Sipowicz."

39:36.165 --> 39:39.043
You know how them people are
with their difficulty trusting us,

39:39.460 --> 39:42.088
and it took Dornan this long to confide.

39:44.590 --> 39:49.136
Uh, tells me, you know,
"I'm going over in my mind,

39:49.512 --> 39:52.181
"for a guy not torn with remorse,"

39:52.515 --> 39:54.975
Suarez may entirely
have given this up too soon,

39:55.059 --> 39:58.104
and she should maybe reopen the case.
That's what he tells me.

39:59.146 --> 40:00.564
(FILES RUSTLING)

40:01.399 --> 40:02.441

-No.

I'm sorry I didn't get this
out of Dornan before.

SYLVIA: Well, Andy, you know
how them people are.

40:43.983 --> 40:48.821
So, remember my feeling, Danny,
not lookin' for anything serious,

40:49.363 --> 40:52.032
that... right now, I just wanna date?

40:52.616 --> 40:54.493
Yeah, I remember you saying that
the other night.

40:55.244 --> 40:56.662
I told you that as soon as we met.

40:56.996 --> 40:59.290
Yeah. I remember
how appealing I found that.

41:01.500 --> 41:02.626
I still mean that.

41:03.586 --> 41:04.628
Okay. Good.

41:05.045 --> 41:10.009
But if things change for us,
and I don't know,

41:10.092 --> 41:15.055
if we... kind of,
naturally went to the next level,

41:15.347 --> 41:16.807
that wouldn't scare me off.

because Iâ€™m a completely honest person.

41:21.437 --> 41:22.521

-Good. You'd like to go to the next level?
-Uh, good I know where you're coming from.

All... all I did was basically tell you
I liked you, and you go off.

42:08.400 --> 42:10.194
What, you like it better
when people say they don't like you?

42:10.277 --> 42:13.405
Nadine, I came over here tonight
because I needed to be with you.

42:14.114 --> 42:17.117
And you came over... and you got laid.

42:18.118 --> 42:19.119
And you only killed an hour.

42:19.203 --> 42:21.121
So, now, you still got time
to hit the bars.

42:23.123 --> 42:24.917
I didn't come over here just for that.

42:27.253 --> 42:30.673
I came over here because I needed
to be next to somebody good.

42:32.841 --> 42:34.343
You're a good person, Nadine.

42:40.599 --> 42:41.600

42:43.394 --> 42:45.271
And Friday night,
when we go catch a movie...

42:46.313 --> 42:48.857
if I pick up on the sense
that maybe you don't wanna talk

42:48.941 --> 42:52.027
and you just wanna enjoy the night,
I'll respect that.

42:52.695 --> 42:53.821
Nice try.

42:56.031 --> 42:57.575
Besides, I'm busy Friday night.

43:01.203 --> 43:03.038
Well, hopefully, some other time then.

43:11.630 --> 43:13.132
Maybe Saturday night, though.

43:17.428 --> 43:18.762
I'll swing by around 8:00.

43:20.139 --> 43:21.140
Okay.
