WEBVTT

00:01.567 --> 00:04.069
Cheers is filmed
before a live studio audience.

00:04.103 --> 00:06.304
Boy, oh, boy,
oh, boy. Yep.

00:06.305 --> 00:08.239
Woody's wedding was quite
an event, wasn't it, Norm?

00:08.240 --> 00:09.740
Oh, man.
Huh, huh?

00:09.775 --> 00:11.842
Boy, what a night
that was. Yeah.

00:11.843 --> 00:13.060
Yeah, the priest dying.
Yeah.

00:13.061 --> 00:14.963
Carla being caught
in a dumb-waiter.

00:14.997 --> 00:16.297
Ha!

00:16.299 --> 00:18.032
How about that German guy
trying to kill Sam?

00:18.033 --> 00:19.000
(chuckling)

00:19.001 --> 00:20.134
"Du, dort!"

00:20.169 --> 00:22.103
Remember that?

00:22.137 --> 00:23.738
Yeah, oh, golly.

00:23.739 --> 00:25.407
Oh, yeah, but all that
was nothing

00:25.408 --> 00:26.824
compared to the
wedding itself. Yeah.

00:26.825 --> 00:29.143
Oh, now, there
was a comedy of errors.

00:29.178 --> 00:30.578
(chuckling)

00:30.613 --> 00:32.447
Hey, it's not
quite 2:00.

00:32.448 --> 00:34.749
What do you say we, uh,
stop off at Cheers, huh?

00:34.750 --> 00:36.518
Won't, uh...
won't Vera be angry?

00:36.552 --> 00:37.602
She'll never know.

00:37.603 --> 00:38.820
Yeah, well, I guess not.

00:38.821 --> 00:40.322
She... she sure
put away

00:40.323 --> 00:41.389
that champagne at the wedding.

00:41.390 --> 00:43.758
Yeah, she's a big girl.

00:43.793 --> 00:46.795
Yeah, she's still
out cold, too.

00:46.829 --> 00:48.396
(sighs)

00:48.431 --> 00:51.533
Okay, just don't slam the
door when you get out.

00:51.567 --> 00:53.435
And remember...
crack a window.

00:53.436 --> 00:55.203
You're a good husband,
Norm Peterson.

CARLA:
Okay, Sammy, I'm going home.

01:43.068 --> 01:44.536
I put away all the glasses.

01:44.670 --> 01:46.721
The, uh, bottles
are in the storeroom,

01:46.722 --> 01:48.189
and all the rest of the garbage

01:48.190 --> 01:49.424
from the wedding's
in the office.

01:49.425 --> 01:50.658
Thank you, honey, I'll lock up.

01:50.659 --> 01:51.793
Where's Rebecca?

01:51.844 --> 01:54.129
Just told you,
she's in the office.

01:54.439 --> 01:56.548
Hey, Norm, uh, you mind

01:56.549 --> 01:58.650
if we make a stop or two
on the way home?

01:58.684 --> 02:01.285
I, uh, forgot
to finish my route.

02:01.320 --> 02:03.187
Cliff, no.

02:03.222 --> 02:05.390
Eh, all right.
I'll do it tomorrow.

02:08.360 --> 02:09.411
Hey, Rebecca.

02:09.428 --> 02:11.195
Hi, Sam.

02:11.230 --> 02:12.664
You okay?

02:12.665 --> 02:14.366
Yeah, I'm just thinking,
you know.

02:14.367 --> 02:16.434
Weddings always
make me do that.

02:16.436 --> 02:19.437
I have nothing
to show for my life. Oh, come on.

02:19.438 --> 02:21.122
You're being a little harsh
on yourself, aren't you?

02:21.123 --> 02:22.173
I mean, come on,

02:22.174 --> 02:23.357
take a look at today, right?

02:23.358 --> 02:25.108
The wedding started
to fall apart.

02:25.127 --> 02:27.328
You pulled the whole
thing together.

02:27.329 --> 02:28.796
Yeah, I sort of did, didn't I?

02:28.797 --> 02:30.064
You bet you did.

02:30.065 --> 02:31.782
You know, you know,
I used to think

02:31.783 --> 02:34.785
that if I married a millionaire
or if I had a baby,

02:34.820 --> 02:37.389
I'd be a better person,
but now I realize

02:37.423 --> 02:38.923
that the only thing

02:38.924 --> 02:40.959
that's gonna make me
a better person is me.

02:40.960 --> 02:44.128
Boy, as scary
as that sounds, it's true.

02:44.197 --> 02:45.981
In fact, you see this cigarette?

02:45.982 --> 02:48.400
This is the last cigarette
I'm gonna smoke forever.

02:48.401 --> 02:49.701
(chuckles)
This is gonna be my...

02:49.702 --> 02:51.102
my symbol of change,

02:51.103 --> 02:52.570
you know, the old Rebecca
burning away.

02:52.571 --> 02:53.938
And I'll tell you
something else.

02:53.939 --> 02:55.006
Starting tomorrow,

02:55.007 --> 02:56.474
there's gonna
be no more whining

02:56.475 --> 02:57.675
and no more complaining.

02:57.676 --> 02:59.411
I am gonna be the best manager

02:59.445 --> 03:00.778
in the whole world.

03:00.830 --> 03:01.913
(chuckling)

03:01.948 --> 03:04.415
Okay, good night.

03:06.051 --> 03:08.186
I gotta get my life together.

03:08.188 --> 03:09.670
No more screw ups.

03:09.705 --> 03:11.572
No more mistakes.

03:14.409 --> 03:16.511
Good-bye, old Rebecca.

03:17.846 --> 03:20.982
(door opening, closing)

03:21.017 --> 03:22.617
(crackling)

03:25.554 --> 03:28.490
(indistinct radio chatter)

03:32.282 --> 03:37.732
Well, I think we've got this one
pretty much under control.

03:37.733 --> 03:39.034
You get hold of the owner?

03:39.035 --> 03:40.868
Yes, sir, should be
here any minute.

03:40.920 --> 03:43.588
Engines 28 and 30
can head back.

03:44.674 --> 03:46.641
Oh...

03:46.643 --> 03:48.860
oh, my God.

03:48.928 --> 03:50.078
Mr. Malone.

03:50.112 --> 03:52.580
Everything's under control.

03:52.632 --> 03:54.449
The fire's out,
no one was hurt.

03:54.483 --> 03:57.752
It was basically confined
to this end of the bar.

03:58.604 --> 03:59.921
Oh...

03:59.955 --> 04:02.006
oh, this is terrible.

04:04.560 --> 04:06.261
How did...

04:06.295 --> 04:08.263
This is my bar.

04:11.567 --> 04:13.134
Oh, man.

04:14.903 --> 04:17.539
Oh, oh, yes, wait a minute.

04:17.541 --> 04:19.240
(laughing loudly)

04:19.325 --> 04:20.475
Oh, thank God!

04:20.476 --> 04:21.509
Whoo!

04:21.510 --> 04:22.810
(laughing)

04:22.844 --> 04:24.045
This is great.

04:24.080 --> 04:25.880
This is really good.

04:25.882 --> 04:27.115
I'm sorry?

04:27.116 --> 04:29.300
Gary, you know, from
Gary's Olde Towne Tavern?

04:29.301 --> 04:30.301
Oh, we're doing...

04:30.302 --> 04:31.886
always doing pranks
like this, you know.

04:31.887 --> 04:34.022
First, he makes the bar
look like it burned down,

04:34.023 --> 04:36.207
and then he gets you guys
to go along with it.

04:36.225 --> 04:37.875
You are very good.

04:37.909 --> 04:39.444
Whoo!

04:40.763 --> 04:42.747
Come on, lighten up, will you?

04:42.781 --> 04:44.516
Come on, Gary!

04:44.518 --> 04:45.733
Come on out.

04:45.734 --> 04:47.501
Hey, you know,
time to push the button,

04:47.502 --> 04:49.603
make everything
go back together again, Gary.

04:49.604 --> 04:51.172
Gary!

04:58.030 --> 04:59.613
It's not Gary, is it?

05:06.522 --> 05:09.124
Sammy, this is terrible.

05:09.463 --> 05:12.093
You know, it just hurts me

05:12.094 --> 05:13.428
just to look at this place.

05:13.512 --> 05:14.779
I know, I know.

05:14.814 --> 05:16.414
But I'll tell you something.

05:16.415 --> 05:18.132
As soon as the
insurance kicks in,

05:18.133 --> 05:19.284
we're gonna get this place

05:19.285 --> 05:21.095
back on its feet
in a couple of weeks.

05:21.120 --> 05:22.954
I just wish I knew
how it started.

05:24.356 --> 05:26.591
Hold it right there.

05:26.625 --> 05:28.292
What are you saying, Sammy?

05:28.294 --> 05:31.462
That a Tortelli kid
would torch his mother's

05:31.497 --> 05:33.598
place of business
just for spite?

05:33.699 --> 05:35.483
No, I'd never think that.

05:35.568 --> 05:37.685
Why not? It's
plausible.

05:37.686 --> 05:40.721
Listen, just...
just start cleaning up.

05:40.722 --> 05:42.540
You know, we're gonna...
all gonna feel better

05:42.541 --> 05:43.641
if we just start cleaning up.

05:43.642 --> 05:44.975
You know, I gotta say, Sammy,

05:44.976 --> 05:46.878
you're taking this whole thing
pretty darn well.

05:46.879 --> 05:48.345
Not like some people.

05:48.380 --> 05:49.980
NORM:
Oh, the humanity.

05:50.015 --> 05:52.950
(Norm crying)

05:52.984 --> 05:55.653
Norm, I wish you'd
stop saying that.

05:55.687 --> 05:57.789
You've got to get a
hold of yourself.

05:59.225 --> 06:00.658
I'm sorry, I...
I just...

06:00.692 --> 06:04.929
This place means
so damn much to me.

06:04.963 --> 06:06.781
It's my home.

06:06.815 --> 06:10.334
Hell, for the last few years,
it's been my life.

06:10.335 --> 06:12.003
And the thought of living
without it, Sammy...

06:12.004 --> 06:14.489
(Norm weeping)

06:14.523 --> 06:16.290
Oh, buddy.

06:16.291 --> 06:17.424
Now, I'm gonna be
over at Gary's

06:17.425 --> 06:18.875
for the next few days, okay?

06:20.029 --> 06:21.929
I want you to give me a call

06:21.964 --> 06:23.698
when it looks
decent, all right?

06:26.335 --> 06:28.419
Somebody said
there'd been a fire.

06:28.504 --> 06:29.737
Oh, my God,

06:29.789 --> 06:31.972
I had no idea it was this bad.

06:32.007 --> 06:33.474
Sam, what happened?

06:33.475 --> 06:34.909
We don't know yet, sweetheart.

06:34.910 --> 06:36.711
But don't worry,
everything's gonna be fine.

06:36.712 --> 06:38.263
I've already called
the contractor,

06:38.264 --> 06:39.914
phone company,

06:39.915 --> 06:40.781
the electric guy.

06:40.782 --> 06:42.049
I think that's everybody.

06:42.101 --> 06:43.734
Sam...?

06:44.687 --> 06:47.454
Well, almost everybody.

06:47.473 --> 06:50.475
Well, Sam, I see you monkeys
have discovered fire.

06:53.722 --> 06:56.730
Would you like to come upstairs

06:56.731 --> 06:58.481
and see the damage
at Melville's?

06:59.452 --> 07:00.919
You know, why not?

07:00.953 --> 07:03.387
It might even cheer me up.

07:05.458 --> 07:06.858
Hi, everybody.

07:08.294 --> 07:10.060
What happened here?

07:10.062 --> 07:11.395
Woody, we had a fire.

07:11.413 --> 07:13.965
Oh, no.

07:13.999 --> 07:16.567
This is terrible.

07:16.601 --> 07:20.038
This is Cheers, my home
for the past seven years,

07:20.072 --> 07:23.241
the place where I grew
up, and now look at it.

07:23.243 --> 07:24.743
You ought to see the pool table.

07:24.776 --> 07:26.444
It actually fused to the floor.

07:26.446 --> 07:28.313
Really? Cool.

07:31.100 --> 07:34.469
Oh, my God.

07:34.503 --> 07:38.506
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

07:40.476 --> 07:42.676
Oh, my God.

07:45.581 --> 07:47.882
Cliff, was that
undelivered mail?

07:47.950 --> 07:49.717
Oh, yeah, it was, Doc.

07:49.719 --> 07:51.135
Oh...

07:51.170 --> 07:53.271
my sweet Lord,
what a catastrophe.

07:53.305 --> 07:56.940
I mean, there could be letters
from mothers to sons in there.

07:56.975 --> 07:59.510
Social Security checks,
wedding invitations.

08:01.046 --> 08:03.781
Well, there's only one thing
left for me to do now.

08:03.799 --> 08:04.865
What's that, Cliff?

08:04.884 --> 08:05.964
Get up early tomorrow

08:05.984 --> 08:07.985
and stage a Jeep accident.

08:09.115 --> 08:13.574
Well, it's a good thing
this fire didn't spread.

08:13.575 --> 08:15.042
It could have been
like that fire

08:15.043 --> 08:17.011
my great-grandmother's
cow started.

08:17.012 --> 08:20.298
Darned thing kicked
over a lantern,

08:20.299 --> 08:22.109
burned an entire city
to the ground.

08:23.202 --> 08:24.602
Yep.

08:24.620 --> 08:27.371
The shame was so great,
the family had to move to Ohio

08:27.406 --> 08:29.741
and change their last name
to Wilkins.

08:30.960 --> 08:32.727
But, Woody, you're
from Indiana,

08:32.760 --> 08:34.895
and your family name is Boyd.

08:34.929 --> 08:37.832
Oh, well, some stuff
happened in Ohio.

08:40.251 --> 08:42.770
Come on, Woody, we've got
to get to the airport.

08:44.706 --> 08:47.141
You know,
when these things happen,

08:47.176 --> 08:49.377
it really makes you
stop and think.

08:51.296 --> 08:54.498
Bye, everybody.

08:54.533 --> 08:57.134
Next time you see us,
we'll be tan.

08:57.152 --> 08:58.469
Bye, Woody.

09:00.356 --> 09:03.407
Well, I discovered
the cause of the fire.

09:03.442 --> 09:05.075
Same old story.

09:05.110 --> 09:08.363
Some idiot tosses a cigarette
into a trash can,

09:08.397 --> 09:09.797
and the whole thing goes up.

09:09.832 --> 09:11.598
Are you sure?

09:11.617 --> 09:13.051
Yeah, seen it 100 times.

09:13.085 --> 09:15.086
When are people gonna learn?

09:15.120 --> 09:19.373
(hyperventilating)

09:19.458 --> 09:20.641
Are you all right?

09:20.676 --> 09:21.842
Uh-huh, I'm fine.

09:23.678 --> 09:24.879
Oh, my God.

09:24.881 --> 09:26.664
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

09:26.715 --> 09:27.832
Oh, my God.

09:27.866 --> 09:29.566
Oh, my God.

09:29.601 --> 09:31.401
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

09:31.402 --> 09:32.637
You know, I couldn't help

09:32.638 --> 09:34.328
overhearing that conversation.

09:35.274 --> 09:37.425
Wild guess:
Your cigarette?

09:39.661 --> 09:41.396
No.

09:41.397 --> 09:43.649
Rebecca, you burned down
the bar, didn't you?

09:43.650 --> 09:46.833
What, am I wearing a sign?

09:46.869 --> 09:48.385
Are you gonna tell Sam?

09:48.419 --> 09:49.586
Could you?

09:49.655 --> 09:51.589
I don't really think
it's my place.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.641
No, I mean, could you tell him
you did it?

09:54.300 --> 09:58.596
Rebecca, you have a very
difficult choice to make.

09:58.597 --> 10:01.099
My advice to you is to
simply tell Sam the truth.

10:01.133 --> 10:03.434
He's gonna find out
about it in any event.

10:03.469 --> 10:04.935
You're right.

10:04.969 --> 10:06.671
He will.

10:06.705 --> 10:08.406
All right, I'll tell him.

10:08.440 --> 10:10.574
And I mean,
he's a friend of mine,

10:10.592 --> 10:11.742
and it was an accident.

10:11.760 --> 10:13.270
He'll understand, won't he?

10:13.929 --> 10:15.095
Okay.

10:15.130 --> 10:16.330
Thank you, I feel better.

10:16.348 --> 10:17.498
(footsteps)

10:18.484 --> 10:19.817
REBECCA:
Sam?

10:19.852 --> 10:21.668
Could I talk to you a second?

10:21.687 --> 10:23.404
Yeah.

10:25.674 --> 10:28.175
Sam, we found out how
the fire got started.

10:28.243 --> 10:29.760
You're kidding.
No, and-and...

10:29.761 --> 10:31.946
the guy said, you know,
he's seen it happen

10:31.947 --> 10:34.048
100 times, so he's
seen it a lot.

10:34.083 --> 10:36.451
How did it happen?
What...

10:36.452 --> 10:38.336
I-I'm getting to that, it's
just sort of hard to say.

10:38.337 --> 10:39.287
Please tell me.

10:39.288 --> 10:40.798
All right, all
right, I-I'll...

10:41.373 --> 10:43.574
The fire was started by...

10:46.779 --> 10:48.412
Faulty wiring.

10:51.449 --> 10:53.017
Faulty wiring?

10:53.052 --> 10:55.452
Faulty wiring.

10:55.471 --> 10:57.738
Been meaning to take care
of that for years.

10:57.740 --> 10:59.256
My God.

11:00.693 --> 11:03.043
I burned down my own bar.

11:03.078 --> 11:04.945
Oh, Sam.
Oh!

11:04.946 --> 11:05.897
It's gonna be okay.

11:05.898 --> 11:07.231
We all make stupid mistakes.

11:07.232 --> 11:09.000
No.

11:09.034 --> 11:11.201
(both crying)

11:18.292 --> 11:20.778
CARLA:
Okay, guys, I got

11:20.779 --> 11:21.712
the plastic bags.

11:21.713 --> 11:23.213
You can start bagging the soot.

11:24.750 --> 11:26.017
What happened to you?

11:26.118 --> 11:29.302
Uh, a little Jeep accident.

11:33.625 --> 11:36.210
Nice of you to, uh...
join us, Norm. Well...

11:36.211 --> 11:38.746
Thought you were gonna
wait it out at Gary's. Well, I was,

11:38.747 --> 11:40.931
but then it... I
came to my senses

11:40.965 --> 11:42.566
and realized my place was here

11:42.601 --> 11:44.001
helping Sammy.

11:44.002 --> 11:45.787
If we all pitch in,
we'll have this place

11:45.788 --> 11:47.187
back together in no time.

11:47.188 --> 11:48.840
Gary wouldn't run you
a tab, huh?

11:48.841 --> 11:50.142
No, he was a real
jerk about it, too.

11:50.143 --> 11:53.010
(door squeaks open)

11:53.061 --> 11:55.112
FRASIER:
Rebecca? What?

11:55.264 --> 11:57.397
Have you told Sam
how the fire started?

11:57.399 --> 12:00.567
Oh, yeah, I told him, and, uh,
he kissed me, and he hugged me,

12:00.686 --> 12:03.537
and he-he told me what
a big person I was to tell him.

12:03.538 --> 12:04.939
You didn't tell him, did you?

12:04.940 --> 12:06.724
Of course not, you moron!

12:06.758 --> 12:08.159
Rebecca, don't

12:08.160 --> 12:09.493
you realize
that unless you tell him,

12:09.494 --> 12:10.862
your guilt will get
progressively worse?

12:10.863 --> 12:12.346
You'll start to shake.

12:12.380 --> 12:14.081
You'll get the cold sweats,

12:14.082 --> 12:15.165
insomnia, nervousness.

12:15.166 --> 12:16.800
Suddenly one morning,
you'll wake up,

12:16.801 --> 12:19.003
and you'll be paralysed
from fear and guilt.

12:19.004 --> 12:21.188
I can live with that.

12:22.624 --> 12:24.554
It'll just be like
every other Monday.

12:26.044 --> 12:29.647
Well, I called
the insurance company.

12:29.681 --> 12:31.849
We're not getting a penny.

12:31.850 --> 12:32.683
What?!

12:32.684 --> 12:34.318
Well, it turns out

12:34.352 --> 12:37.554
that my insurance policy, uh,
had a $25,000 deductible.

12:37.606 --> 12:39.707
Isn't that rather high, Sam?

12:39.741 --> 12:40.908
Yes, it is,

12:40.909 --> 12:42.176
Mr. Where The
Hell Were You

12:42.177 --> 12:44.347
When the Agent Was
Talking a Mile a Minute?

12:45.981 --> 12:47.664
God, man, I'm, um,

12:47.699 --> 12:50.467
in a lot more trouble
than I thought I was.

12:50.502 --> 12:53.737
Rest easy, my friend.

12:53.789 --> 12:56.524
I'm gonna take out my cheque book,

12:56.526 --> 12:59.209
and I'm going to write,

12:59.244 --> 13:01.061
"Pay to the order

13:01.096 --> 13:04.098
of Sam Malone."

13:04.132 --> 13:06.033
Then I'm going
to fill in an amount

13:06.035 --> 13:07.885
that will be more than adequate

13:07.920 --> 13:10.054
to bring Cheers back
to its former glory.

13:11.623 --> 13:14.025
There. I've signed it.

13:14.059 --> 13:17.828
Now all we need is the signature
of Lilith Sternin-Crane.

13:19.932 --> 13:22.967
Oh, she'll put up a fight,
the little badger,

13:23.001 --> 13:26.203
but this is important to you,
so it's important to me.

13:26.205 --> 13:28.856
I'm simply gonna go home
and demand that she sign it.

13:28.890 --> 13:30.157
Yes, demand!

13:30.192 --> 13:31.725
I don't care what she says.

13:31.759 --> 13:33.260
She will sign it!

13:36.014 --> 13:37.148
Thanks, Fras.

13:37.149 --> 13:38.682
Uh, you know, I'll
probably just go

13:38.683 --> 13:40.251
to a bank or
something, you know?

13:40.252 --> 13:42.870
Oh, thank you, Sam, thank you.

13:44.540 --> 13:47.808
There was... no way.

13:47.843 --> 13:49.776
You understand.

13:55.601 --> 13:58.052
Your monthly cash flow is,

13:58.086 --> 14:00.321
uh, this figure here?

14:00.323 --> 14:01.605
And now you want us

14:01.640 --> 14:03.507
to grant you a loan?

14:03.559 --> 14:06.009
Yes, please, and by
the end of the day, too.

14:06.044 --> 14:07.411
Thank you.
Uh-huh.

14:07.446 --> 14:11.381
Am I on one of those programs
with the hidden camera?

14:11.400 --> 14:14.235
Oh, no, I-I'm
afraid you're not.

14:14.237 --> 14:15.385
I know I'm not.

14:15.420 --> 14:17.554
I was making a point.

14:17.573 --> 14:19.907
Mr. Malone,

14:19.958 --> 14:22.709
there is no way
we can grant you a loan.

14:22.710 --> 14:23.994
I've been to
every bank in town.

14:23.995 --> 14:25.129
They've all said no.

14:25.130 --> 14:26.363
Listen, oh, come on, you know,

14:26.364 --> 14:27.965
you're supposed to
be the friendly bank.

the commercial. You know,

14:34.840 --> 14:36.373
you-you're supposed to sweep
everything off your desk here

14:36.374 --> 14:37.908
and offer me a cup of coffee.

14:37.909 --> 14:39.593
You don't even have
any coffee here!

14:39.594 --> 14:41.029
Mr. Malone,
good afternoon!

Sam...

14:53.942 --> 14:55.876
I burned down the bar.

14:55.877 --> 14:59.613
And, you know, see,
speaking of bars burning down,

14:59.614 --> 15:00.748
guess what I did?

15:04.536 --> 15:06.887
Hi, Sam.
Did you get the loan?

15:06.889 --> 15:08.271
No.

15:08.290 --> 15:09.589
Oh.

15:09.591 --> 15:12.159
It's all right,
though, you know.

15:12.193 --> 15:13.994
It's not the end of the world.

15:14.028 --> 15:16.018
Yeah, I've been
thinking long and hard.

15:16.030 --> 15:17.364
I got a plan here.

15:17.432 --> 15:20.284
You know, I figured
that if I, uh... if I cash in

15:20.352 --> 15:24.171
my baseball pension, you know,
max out my credit cards

15:24.222 --> 15:26.440
and maybe move
to a cheaper apartment,

15:26.475 --> 15:28.275
and...

15:28.310 --> 15:31.545
well... sell the Vette.

15:31.613 --> 15:33.664
A neighbour of mine, Kirby, uh,

15:33.666 --> 15:36.450
had his eye on it
for a long time,

15:36.452 --> 15:39.286
and, uh, he's upstairs right now
taking a look at it.

15:39.287 --> 15:40.620
No, no.
Sammy, your Vette?

15:40.621 --> 15:43.290
Well, I... You know,
it'll be all right, um...

15:43.292 --> 15:44.424
she'll come back to me.

15:44.459 --> 15:45.926
She'll-She'll find me.

15:45.928 --> 15:47.678
Like...

15:47.713 --> 15:49.980
Lassie?

15:54.252 --> 15:57.438
All right, Sam,
you got yourself a deal.

15:57.439 --> 15:58.505
All right, okay.

15:58.506 --> 15:59.840
There's the check.
Yeah, thanks.

15:59.841 --> 16:01.174
Thanks, Kirby.
That's great.

16:01.175 --> 16:03.310
The, uh... the
title and the, uh,

16:03.311 --> 16:05.763
registration are in
the glove compartment. Yeah.

16:05.764 --> 16:06.981
Okay. Great.

16:07.015 --> 16:09.583
Well, uh, so I guess
all I need now are the keys.

16:13.438 --> 16:17.108
Sam, the, uh, keys?

16:21.329 --> 16:23.831
Thanks.

16:28.120 --> 16:30.787
Thanks.

16:30.839 --> 16:32.239
No, no! Wait! Wait...!

16:32.274 --> 16:33.540
(groans)

16:33.592 --> 16:34.808
Please.

16:34.809 --> 16:35.842
Listen, there-there's
another way.

16:35.843 --> 16:37.411
I just thought of another way.

16:37.445 --> 16:38.979
See, I can get this money.

16:39.014 --> 16:41.348
All I have to do is,
uh, come up

16:41.382 --> 16:43.617
with a simple product
that America needs.

16:43.685 --> 16:45.970
What?

16:45.971 --> 16:47.888
No. Listen to me. You know,
like-like the Pet Rock.

16:47.889 --> 16:49.490
Or the, uh... You know,
the vacuum thing

16:49.491 --> 16:51.225
that-that cuts your hair
at the same time.

16:51.226 --> 16:54.028
Or-Or maybe even,
you know, the-the toilet duck.

16:54.029 --> 16:56.397
You-You know, just throw
it together from scraps

16:56.398 --> 16:58.599
around here, you know,
and-and sell millions of 'em.

16:58.600 --> 17:01.502
You know, why didn't I, uh,
think of that before?

17:01.503 --> 17:03.904
Sam, you're just making
this harder on yourself.

17:03.905 --> 17:06.807
Yeah. Uh, yeah.

17:08.675 --> 17:10.377
Yeah.

17:10.412 --> 17:11.811
You know, they, uh,

17:11.846 --> 17:14.314
stole that toilet duck
idea from me.

17:14.348 --> 17:15.682
Hmm?

17:15.717 --> 17:17.584
Yeah. Yeah,
you see, uh,

17:17.618 --> 17:20.854
in my original sketches,
I had it as a goat.

17:20.888 --> 17:22.890
KIRBY:
Look, uh, Sam,

17:22.892 --> 17:24.624
if you don't mind, uh,

17:24.657 --> 17:26.693
I'm ready
to drive my Corvette home now.

17:31.817 --> 17:33.133
(clears throat)

17:33.167 --> 17:34.968
Sorry, Sammy.
Oh.

17:36.971 --> 17:38.905
Thanks.

17:40.642 --> 17:42.710
(mumbles)

17:45.947 --> 17:48.031
Kirby, take care of her.

17:49.367 --> 17:51.118
(door closes)

17:51.169 --> 17:53.504
This is a day
I never thought I'd see.

17:53.538 --> 17:55.406
SAM:
Yeah, me, too.

17:55.457 --> 17:57.224
You know what makes it worse?

17:57.259 --> 17:58.642
This is all my fault.

17:58.676 --> 18:01.312
You know, I'm the one
who did this to myself.

18:01.314 --> 18:03.264
If I'd checked the wiring,
you know?

18:03.265 --> 18:04.465
That's a stupid mistake

18:04.466 --> 18:06.533
I'm gonna live with
the rest of my life.

18:10.305 --> 18:13.057
(crying)

18:13.059 --> 18:15.375
Oh, come on,
what is it now, Rebecca?

18:15.393 --> 18:17.294
(crying)

18:18.596 --> 18:22.032
I have something
I have to tell you.

18:24.319 --> 18:26.753
(crying)

18:26.755 --> 18:29.439
(Rebecca sniffles)

18:40.502 --> 18:43.170
Sam, the fire
wasn't your fault.

18:44.723 --> 18:47.908
I was smoking a cigarette,
and I burned down your bar.

18:48.810 --> 18:51.245
You did this?

18:52.814 --> 18:56.016
You did this to me?

18:56.101 --> 18:58.652
Yes, yes, of course.

18:58.687 --> 19:02.122
Why didn't I figure
this out earlier?

19:02.156 --> 19:05.358
My bar burns down,
you're within 50 miles...

19:05.410 --> 19:07.010
it all fits.

19:08.864 --> 19:10.948
Sam, I'm so sorry.

19:10.982 --> 19:13.117
Yeah, what-what...
what were you thinking?

19:13.119 --> 19:14.801
Huh?

19:14.836 --> 19:17.270
You tired of screwing
up your own life?

19:17.339 --> 19:19.456
You start to pick on mine?

19:19.458 --> 19:21.608
You know, of all the stupid,

19:21.643 --> 19:23.810
stupid things you've done

19:23.845 --> 19:25.812
in your useless life,

19:25.847 --> 19:27.781
this is your masterpiece!

19:30.218 --> 19:31.951
I'll tell you
what. Why...?

19:33.621 --> 19:34.954
Get out.

19:34.989 --> 19:37.724
Get out of my bar.

19:40.946 --> 19:42.712
(sighs)

19:45.283 --> 19:47.167
(door opening)

19:47.168 --> 19:48.785
(horn honking, engine revving)

19:48.786 --> 19:51.454
Sam, it was an accident.

19:51.456 --> 19:52.890
She had it coming.

19:52.924 --> 19:54.725
Nobody had that coming.

19:54.759 --> 19:57.561
I don't want anyone
to defend her.

19:57.629 --> 19:59.179
She's gone. Case closed.

19:59.214 --> 20:01.782
Let's just get back
to work here.

20:01.833 --> 20:04.184
I'll give you a hand.

20:04.219 --> 20:07.371
Well, I guess we've seen
the dark side of Sam Malone.

20:08.706 --> 20:11.074
Hmm. You want
to see dark sides,

20:11.108 --> 20:13.143
you ought to see Ma

20:13.178 --> 20:14.944
when you leave
the shower curtain

20:14.979 --> 20:16.513
on the outside of the tub.

20:20.802 --> 20:22.803
Wow.

20:24.972 --> 20:27.173
That's something
you don't do twice.

20:40.789 --> 20:43.156
I know you don't want me here,
and I'm going.

20:43.191 --> 20:44.991
I just wanted to drop this off.

20:44.992 --> 20:47.127
I cashed in my checking account
and savings,

20:47.128 --> 20:50.130
and, uh, everything
I could scrape together.

20:50.164 --> 20:51.614
I owe you this.

20:51.649 --> 20:53.467
Good-bye, Sam.

20:53.468 --> 20:54.467
Rebecca, wait-wait a minute.

20:54.468 --> 20:56.136
No.

20:56.170 --> 20:59.723
Sam, look, you and I don't have
anything to say to each other.

20:59.757 --> 21:02.476
You said some things today
that you cannot take back,

21:02.510 --> 21:04.728
and you really hurt me.

21:04.762 --> 21:07.314
And I know
that what I did was terrible,

21:07.315 --> 21:10.017
but what you did was worse
because you did it on purpose.

21:10.018 --> 21:12.786
I don't want to ever
see you or this bar again.

21:12.820 --> 21:15.072
Good-bye.

21:15.106 --> 21:16.874
Do you want your job back?

21:16.908 --> 21:19.592
(crying):
Yeah, I really do!

21:28.202 --> 21:30.504
I'm sorry.

21:30.538 --> 21:32.806
Listen, uh,

21:32.840 --> 21:34.758
why-why don't I, uh,

21:34.792 --> 21:36.993
get my jacket
and drive you home?

21:37.027 --> 21:39.229
Or maybe, uh...

21:39.263 --> 21:40.681
maybe we'll take a walk.

21:40.715 --> 21:42.649
It's such a nice, nice evening.

21:42.683 --> 21:45.936
Sam, uh, just out of curiosity,

21:45.970 --> 21:49.172
why are you taking me back?

21:51.025 --> 21:53.727
Well, I...
I remember that five years ago,

21:53.761 --> 21:57.197
after I had sold this place,
I came back to the bar,

21:57.231 --> 21:59.533
and, you know,
my boat had sunk,

21:59.534 --> 22:01.501
I didn't have a dime,
I didn't have a job,

22:01.502 --> 22:04.272
and I needed someone to give me
a break, and you did that.

22:06.157 --> 22:08.042
And I owe you one.

22:08.076 --> 22:10.294
Sam...

22:10.328 --> 22:14.798
Hey, listen, uh, this
is very important.

22:14.832 --> 22:16.600
We're even now.

22:16.601 --> 22:17.668
Oh...

22:17.669 --> 22:19.436
Yeah. All right.

22:19.437 --> 22:21.721
You want to go out and
get a pizza or something?

22:21.722 --> 22:23.357
Sure.
All right.

22:23.391 --> 22:24.624
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

22:24.659 --> 22:26.560
Um, I don't have any money.

22:26.594 --> 22:28.344
Oh, that's okay.
We'll-We'll just

22:28.346 --> 22:30.363
take it out of my life savings.

22:30.397 --> 22:32.199
All right.

22:33.801 --> 22:35.736
This should just
about cover it.
