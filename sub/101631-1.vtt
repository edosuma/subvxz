WEBVTT

01:08.399 --> 01:10.435
Couldn't you
have gone before?

01:34.926 --> 01:37.562
I'll call you back.
We have a situation.

01:37.596 --> 01:39.165
Put your dog on the lead!

01:39.197 --> 01:41.032
Come on. It's alright.

01:41.066 --> 01:43.569
She'll stick with me. Plenty
of room for your dog to pass.

01:43.602 --> 01:45.604
Haven't you got a lead?

01:45.637 --> 01:48.072
It's not her
causing the ruckus.

01:49.640 --> 01:52.310
All the same.

01:53.644 --> 01:56.414
Wouldn't have hurt
to put him on a lead.

01:56.447 --> 01:58.818
- Huh.
- Huh.

02:21.640 --> 02:24.643
Come here...

02:24.676 --> 02:27.813
Come here.

02:27.845 --> 02:29.515
Wait!

02:30.749 --> 02:32.952
There's no need
to interrupt your walk.

02:32.985 --> 02:36.488
They'll be OK. Just need time
to get to know each other.

02:36.522 --> 02:38.324
Your guy just wants
to show her who's boss.

02:42.126 --> 02:44.529
- Must you?
- Down.

02:52.803 --> 02:54.940
There.

02:56.007 --> 02:57.476
They just need time.

02:58.777 --> 03:00.446
Come on. Henry.

03:02.247 --> 03:03.916
Come on, Tillie.

03:20.298 --> 03:22.367
- You're late today.
- Work.

03:22.400 --> 03:24.702
Huh. Here, Ruby. Come on.

03:24.736 --> 03:26.438
I suppose you want one
and all, eh?

03:26.470 --> 03:29.274
- Thought you'd retired.
- I did too.

03:29.308 --> 03:32.244
I had to go back.
Grandson at uni.

03:32.277 --> 03:34.647
It's tough for 'em.
You know, all them debts.

03:34.679 --> 03:37.215
Oh, I better catch the dog up.

03:37.249 --> 03:38.884
I'll see you later, Dave. 'Bye.

03:38.916 --> 03:40.351
See you, Bob.

03:44.890 --> 03:48.427
Hello, Henry.
Where did you pop up from?

03:48.459 --> 03:51.095
- Henry, come here!
- Where's your missus got to?

03:51.129 --> 03:54.233
- Henry!
- No worries. He's no trouble.

03:54.266 --> 03:55.935
They're friends now.

03:57.336 --> 04:00.071
- Can I give him a treat?
- I don't think so.

04:02.840 --> 04:04.343
Well, if you must.

04:04.375 --> 04:07.146
Come on. Come on, Henry.
Oh, there you go.

04:07.178 --> 04:08.980
Go off and play. Go on.

04:09.013 --> 04:12.451
- Are you always here?
- Yeah, usually at this time.

04:12.483 --> 04:15.620
Out here on the fields. Do you
know King George's Fields?

04:15.654 --> 04:17.723
- No.
- Lot of people don't.

04:17.756 --> 04:19.558
They're lovely.

04:19.590 --> 04:22.494
Come on. I'll show you.

04:22.526 --> 04:25.330
It's alright. I believe you.

04:28.133 --> 04:29.869
Here.

04:33.638 --> 04:37.042
- Come on. Good boy.
- Oh, whoa.

04:40.812 --> 04:42.213
Wow.

04:50.355 --> 04:52.624
Better get back soon.

04:52.658 --> 04:55.694
- Do you live local?
- Uh, not far.

04:57.028 --> 04:58.463
Finchley.

04:58.497 --> 05:00.598
Thought I'd try
bringing him up here.

05:00.631 --> 05:03.802
- More space to run.
- Yeah, we're lucky.

05:03.835 --> 05:08.440
We got all this, the woods,
the golf course too.

05:08.473 --> 05:11.711
I don't like the woods.
Well, not on my own.

05:13.345 --> 05:15.614
Must be different for a woman.

05:16.747 --> 05:19.017
Though you do get lots brave it
with their dogs.

05:19.050 --> 05:21.285
Got to get back.

05:21.319 --> 05:22.888
Suits me.

05:22.920 --> 05:25.891
- Come on, Tillie!
- Henry!

05:25.924 --> 05:27.326
- Come on!
- Come on.

05:27.359 --> 05:29.962
Good boy.

05:31.429 --> 05:33.965
Sorry about the other day.

05:35.033 --> 05:36.568
So you should be.

05:36.600 --> 05:38.771
Big dogs make a person nervous.

05:38.804 --> 05:42.074
Those guard dogs get treated bad
to make them nasty.

05:42.107 --> 05:44.076
This one wouldn't hurt a flea.

05:44.109 --> 05:46.178
Well, yeah, I can see that now.

05:46.211 --> 05:48.747
Her name's Tillie.
Go on, give her a stroke.

05:50.482 --> 05:52.150
Hey.

05:52.184 --> 05:53.552
Tillie.

05:53.585 --> 05:55.220
- This one's Henry, right?
- Yeah.

05:55.252 --> 05:57.021
Can't imagine how you knew.

05:57.054 --> 05:59.257
Come on.

05:59.290 --> 06:01.360
'Bye, Henry.

06:02.727 --> 06:04.429
You here tomorrow?

06:06.932 --> 06:08.667
Come on.

06:15.639 --> 06:17.642
OK if we walk with you?

06:19.076 --> 06:20.578
It's a free country.

06:20.612 --> 06:22.748
He's a Yorkie, right?

06:22.780 --> 06:24.516
Mostly.

06:25.383 --> 06:27.186
- How old?
- Three.

06:27.218 --> 06:29.588
She's nine. I think she is.

06:29.621 --> 06:31.924
She's a rescue dog,
so we never knew.

06:40.264 --> 06:42.033
I give her organic food.

06:42.066 --> 06:43.434
You pay a bit more,

06:43.468 --> 06:46.338
but the dogs are less whiffy
around the house.

06:46.371 --> 06:49.041
She eats healthier than I do.

06:49.074 --> 06:50.908
I must pong to high heaven.

06:56.715 --> 06:59.218
My husband took him to classes,

06:59.251 --> 07:03.822
and then he... got busy
and had to stop.

07:03.855 --> 07:06.592
She was a right wallflower
at the start.

07:06.624 --> 07:08.994
It took her ages
to get used to other dogs.

07:09.026 --> 07:12.230
She never had a litter, sadly.
But there you go.

07:12.263 --> 07:14.465
I wouldn't say
she was unfulfilled.

07:14.499 --> 07:16.268
I haven't
had him done yet.

07:17.299 --> 07:18.569
- Good for you.
- I know I should, but...

07:18.602 --> 07:21.906
Let him keep his crown jewels
as long as there's no trouble.

07:22.773 --> 07:26.144
That's me and men.
I'm a soft touch.

07:32.184 --> 07:34.920
Give us your paw.
Hold your horses.

07:35.920 --> 07:38.089
There's enough clay to make
a set of dinner plates

07:38.122 --> 07:39.791
stuck between your toes.

07:40.891 --> 07:42.528
Phew! It's parky in here.

07:42.561 --> 07:45.097
Think I'll leave on my coat, eh?

07:45.129 --> 07:46.932
Save on the heating.

07:50.401 --> 07:52.203
Who's that now?

07:52.237 --> 07:54.071
Are you expecting anybody?

07:54.105 --> 07:55.874
I know I'm not.

07:57.242 --> 07:58.944
Stay.

08:03.881 --> 08:06.285
I just got in with the dog.
You nearly missed us.

08:06.317 --> 08:08.019
Sign here, please.

08:08.052 --> 08:09.588
I'm not sure I want this letter.

08:09.621 --> 08:12.291
Chasing me for rent.
Do I have to accept it?

08:12.324 --> 08:14.059
No, I suppose not.

08:14.091 --> 08:15.626
Then you would have missed us.

08:15.660 --> 08:17.530
They'll only try again tomorrow.

08:18.896 --> 08:22.200
Get back in the kitchen.
Look at the mess you're making.

08:22.234 --> 08:24.169
OK, give us it here.

08:24.201 --> 08:27.071
No point in putting off
the evil day.

08:28.372 --> 08:31.409
- Cheers.
- Thanks.

08:34.478 --> 08:36.547
Do you know good kennels?

08:36.580 --> 08:38.382
I've got to go away
in a few months,

08:38.415 --> 08:40.718
and the last kennel
I put him in, he hated.

08:40.751 --> 08:42.588
I'll ask around.

08:42.621 --> 08:45.490
Don't put him in a kennel
if you can help it.

08:45.522 --> 08:47.425
Can't you take him with you?

08:47.458 --> 08:50.429
My daughter's getting married.
She lives in the Canaries.

08:50.462 --> 08:52.764
- Ah, right.
- Marrying a Spaniard.

08:52.796 --> 08:54.232
Bless.

08:54.266 --> 08:56.235
I'm nervous enough
about meeting his family

08:56.267 --> 08:57.935
without having to worry
about the dog.

08:59.737 --> 09:01.607
Oh, I wish I knew some Spanish.

09:01.640 --> 09:04.809
- I speak Spanish.
- Really?

09:04.843 --> 09:06.545
Yeah. Cleaner taught me.

09:06.578 --> 09:09.915
- I'll bet she did.
- It wasn't like that.

09:11.882 --> 09:14.819
I could take the dog probably
when you go.

09:14.852 --> 09:17.122
Oh, thanks. That's kind.

09:17.155 --> 09:20.259
But let's see nearer the time.

09:26.598 --> 09:29.668
- What do you do?
- Did. I was a nurse.

09:29.700 --> 09:31.502
Mental health.

09:31.535 --> 09:34.439
My wife was too. Intensive care.

09:34.472 --> 09:36.574
Bit more high-powered.

09:36.607 --> 09:39.044
- How about you?
- Uh, receptionist.

09:39.077 --> 09:41.179
- Part-time.
- Nice.

09:41.212 --> 09:43.715
At a natural therapy centre.

09:43.747 --> 09:46.150
I work mornings, so...

09:46.184 --> 09:48.185
Both in the health trade, then.

09:56.328 --> 09:58.230
- Ooh!
- Wish I'd brought me brolly.

09:58.262 --> 10:00.331
Ah, it's only rain.

10:00.365 --> 10:03.001
Oh.

10:05.770 --> 10:09.308
Can't talk now, love.
I'll call you later.

10:09.341 --> 10:11.844
No, not now. Really.

10:14.145 --> 10:16.415
I'll call you. Promise.

10:19.050 --> 10:20.585
My daughter.

10:22.853 --> 10:24.989
Come on.

10:37.901 --> 10:39.704
Oh, this is nice.

10:42.272 --> 10:44.608
I didn't realise
what I was missing!

10:44.641 --> 10:46.645
I'd have put my boots on,
though.

10:46.678 --> 10:49.715
I'll need to get
some proper walking boots.

10:51.116 --> 10:53.552
Whoa!

10:54.419 --> 10:57.956
♪ Mud, mud, glorious mud

10:57.988 --> 11:02.060
♪ There's nothing quite like it

11:03.395 --> 11:06.430
♪ So follow me, follow

11:15.540 --> 11:18.843
Flanders and Swann.
I loved that as a kid.

11:18.876 --> 11:20.045
Children's favourite.

11:20.078 --> 11:23.148
- Before my time.
- A likely story!

11:23.180 --> 11:24.949
So, what was your favourite?

11:24.982 --> 11:26.819
I don't know.

11:28.420 --> 11:30.488
The woods.

11:31.823 --> 11:33.792
Just listen to the woods.

11:35.193 --> 11:36.995
Can't get better than that.

12:10.862 --> 12:14.031
Here you go, Tillie.

12:14.064 --> 12:16.001
Fetch!

12:16.034 --> 12:17.936
Whoo! Fetch!

12:21.573 --> 12:24.242
"Qué tal?" Go on, say it.

12:24.275 --> 12:25.977
Do I have to?

12:26.010 --> 12:27.779
Qué tal?

12:27.811 --> 12:31.182
It means "How's it going?"
Now the whole thing.

12:31.216 --> 12:33.285
- Hola.
- Buenos días.

12:33.318 --> 12:36.888
- Qué tal?
- Muy bien. Gracias, señorita.

12:36.920 --> 12:39.824
Oh, 'señorita'!

12:39.857 --> 12:42.794
My arse!

12:42.827 --> 12:44.963
Here we go!

12:44.996 --> 12:47.299
Here. Come here. Come here.

12:48.299 --> 12:50.736
Come here.

12:53.371 --> 12:55.574
No!

12:55.607 --> 12:57.242
Don't think that dog's
gonna save you.

12:57.275 --> 12:59.244
No! Ow!

12:59.276 --> 13:00.878
I surrender!

13:00.911 --> 13:03.514
Truce.

13:10.054 --> 13:11.723
I see you've got a wedding band.

13:11.756 --> 13:14.726
Where's your wife?
Doesn't she ever walk Tillie?

13:14.758 --> 13:17.161
Not now. She's gone.

13:17.194 --> 13:19.030
What, left you?

13:20.098 --> 13:21.800
Passed on.

13:21.833 --> 13:23.331
Oh, sorry.

13:23.333 --> 13:25.871
- Long ago?
- Couple of years.

13:26.703 --> 13:30.409
- That must be hard.
- Yes.

13:32.510 --> 13:34.513
I thought about you yesterday.

13:35.512 --> 13:37.348
I came upon a homeless guy

13:37.381 --> 13:40.218
collapsed on a bench
by the green.

13:40.251 --> 13:43.454
Dead, drunk - I wasn't sure.

13:43.487 --> 13:46.790
What, and he reminded you of me?
Oh, thanks very much!

13:46.824 --> 13:48.926
No, no. Just...

13:48.959 --> 13:51.396
I didn't know whether
to get involved or not.

13:51.429 --> 13:55.333
I thought, "I wish I was walking
with Henry's mistress.

13:55.366 --> 13:57.569
"She'd tell me what to do."

13:57.602 --> 13:58.870
Really?

13:58.904 --> 14:02.140
His pulse was all over the place
so I just called the ambulance.

14:02.173 --> 14:05.644
Well, lucky for him. Don't think
I'd have been as generous.

14:07.212 --> 14:09.213
So, what about you? You married?

14:09.247 --> 14:11.882
Sorry, it's none of my business.

14:11.915 --> 14:15.020
No, he... he did leave me,
a few months ago,

14:15.053 --> 14:16.655
for a younger model.

14:16.688 --> 14:18.723
- You're young enough.
- Oh, no, it's alright.

14:18.756 --> 14:20.791
He wasn't a very nice man,
as it turned out.

14:20.824 --> 14:23.194
He was my second.
She's welcome to him.

14:23.227 --> 14:26.363
She's his secretary.
How's that for a cliché?

14:26.396 --> 14:28.465
Are they both going
to the wedding?

14:28.498 --> 14:30.668
Oh, he thinks
he's running the show.

14:30.702 --> 14:32.270
Ouch.

14:32.303 --> 14:34.306
I should take you,

14:34.338 --> 14:36.208
as my fancy man.

14:36.241 --> 14:38.376
That'd take the wind
out of his sails.

14:38.409 --> 14:40.578
Oh. I'm sorry.

14:40.612 --> 14:42.280
I don't think
that came out right.

14:42.313 --> 14:45.383
This is NOT about you.
It's about him.

14:45.415 --> 14:47.685
He still thinks he owns me.

14:49.554 --> 14:51.589
Do you want to come back
for a cuppa?

14:51.622 --> 14:54.059
I could use a toilet.

14:55.827 --> 14:57.896
And you, Henry.

14:57.929 --> 14:59.798
There you go.

15:14.444 --> 15:17.214
- Is that her?
- Uh-huh.

15:17.247 --> 15:18.983
She looks nice.

15:20.418 --> 15:22.287
Are those your kids?

15:22.319 --> 15:25.489
That's them. Boy's in Australia.

15:25.522 --> 15:27.891
Him and his boyfriend came over
in the summer.

15:27.925 --> 15:29.526
Nice fella.

15:29.559 --> 15:31.696
It's the girl
that gives us the grief.

15:33.865 --> 15:35.634
Are those her kids?

15:36.501 --> 15:38.737
That's right. Grandkids.

15:38.770 --> 15:41.506
Rafe and Sylvie.
Light of my life.

15:41.539 --> 15:45.076
I help out when she lets it.

15:45.108 --> 15:47.578
She runs a tight ship,
my daughter.

15:47.612 --> 15:49.981
I hope you like it strong.

15:50.014 --> 15:51.650
Shall we go through?

16:05.329 --> 16:07.299
You warm enough?
I've put the heating on.

16:07.332 --> 16:09.668
Yeah, I'm fine.

16:12.569 --> 16:14.672
I can't keep calling you
"Henry's mistress".

16:14.705 --> 16:16.407
I like it.

16:16.440 --> 16:18.609
It's kind of raunchy.

16:18.642 --> 16:20.578
Henry, come!

16:21.612 --> 16:23.748
What's your mistress's name?

16:24.881 --> 16:26.751
I've got her number.

16:26.784 --> 16:29.120
All I need is a name
to go with it.

16:29.152 --> 16:32.223
Fern. It's Fern.

16:32.256 --> 16:34.492
Nice name.

16:34.525 --> 16:36.160
Unusual.

16:36.194 --> 16:39.430
And you're... David?

16:39.463 --> 16:42.700
David to the council.
Dave to you.

16:42.733 --> 16:44.335
Hello, Dave.

16:46.971 --> 16:49.741
Fern, do you play draughts?

16:57.647 --> 16:59.316
You think you're gonna win,
don't you?

17:00.418 --> 17:02.320
You've got another thing
coming.

17:02.352 --> 17:03.987
Uno, dos, tres.

17:04.021 --> 17:05.389
- Oh!
- Gotcha!

17:05.423 --> 17:07.425
Oi, belt up, you.

17:07.457 --> 17:09.093
Just 'cause I beat
your mistress.

17:11.729 --> 17:14.332
I better go,
before I thrash you.

17:14.365 --> 17:16.501
Likely story.

17:16.533 --> 17:19.303
I won't be there tomorrow.

17:19.337 --> 17:21.772
Uh, I've got to see someone.

17:21.806 --> 17:25.977
Wait, your girlfriend, is it?
Your mystery caller?

17:26.010 --> 17:27.945
It's nothing like that.

17:43.194 --> 17:45.062
See you the day after?

17:47.298 --> 17:49.601
Good boy. Come on!

17:49.634 --> 17:51.336
In you go.

17:55.205 --> 17:56.340
Fern?

17:56.374 --> 17:58.743
Thanks for the tea.

18:14.524 --> 18:17.261
Where's your little buddy, eh?

18:17.294 --> 18:19.530
Ah, good girl.

18:21.465 --> 18:24.769
It's chilly today.

18:24.801 --> 18:27.070
Let's get this over with.
I'm knackered.

18:27.104 --> 18:29.473
Have you seen that woman with
the little Yorkie? Henry?

18:29.507 --> 18:32.310
Not today.
Maybe she's been and gone.

18:32.342 --> 18:34.311
Cheers, Dave.

19:00.905 --> 19:03.942
- Hola.
- Hola.

19:06.277 --> 19:08.680
Come on.

19:08.713 --> 19:11.316
Thought you'd given up
coming this way.

19:12.250 --> 19:14.419
- Did I put you off?
- Don't be daft.

19:14.452 --> 19:16.954
I've hardly been out.
I've had a cold.

19:18.289 --> 19:20.325
You've missed some lovely days.

19:20.357 --> 19:22.860
Story of my life.

19:23.728 --> 19:26.631
I was thinking about going back
to walking in Finchley.

19:26.664 --> 19:29.067
No, don't do that.
Not on our account.

19:29.099 --> 19:32.069
We won't get in your way, if
you'd rather walk on your own.

19:32.103 --> 19:33.972
I get these moods. I just...

19:35.138 --> 19:37.274
I just kind of lose faith.

19:37.308 --> 19:40.045
I'll keep an eye out.
Dodge the bullet.

19:41.078 --> 19:43.315
I don't like mysteries, Dave.

19:44.214 --> 19:46.584
No. I understand.

19:48.653 --> 19:50.054
Uh...

19:50.087 --> 19:52.656
Ask me a question in Spanish.

20:05.368 --> 20:08.106
- Qué?
- Bad taste. Never mind.

20:08.138 --> 20:09.907
You alright, Dave?

20:09.941 --> 20:11.977
It's alright, Tillie. Come on.

20:13.610 --> 20:16.280
Fern, this is Bob and Ruby.

20:16.313 --> 20:18.982
Bob, this is Fern and Henry.

20:19.015 --> 20:20.584
- Hello, Ruby.
- Henry.

20:20.617 --> 20:22.887
That the dog you were
talking about the other week?

20:25.589 --> 20:27.725
Fuck off, Bob.

20:29.059 --> 20:30.994
Oh. Oh.

20:31.028 --> 20:33.030
Um, I better get back.

20:33.063 --> 20:35.900
- Nice to meet you.
- And you.

20:36.901 --> 20:37.969
'Bye, Ruby.

20:38.001 --> 20:40.605
Come on, Ruby.

20:43.139 --> 20:45.342
You got any other children?

20:45.376 --> 20:48.011
A son. Lives in Devon.

20:48.044 --> 20:50.247
He did a lot of drugs.

20:50.280 --> 20:53.216
He's clean now, thank goodness.
Got a job.

20:53.250 --> 20:56.154
No steady girlfriend
as far as I know,

20:56.186 --> 20:58.622
but we live in hope.

20:58.655 --> 20:59.991
That's it.

21:00.023 --> 21:02.659
It's not how we thought
it was gonna be, is it?

21:02.693 --> 21:04.862
That's for sure.

21:09.599 --> 21:11.302
Come on.

21:20.478 --> 21:23.515
Hey, good boy.

21:24.548 --> 21:27.585
Hi, Dave. Come in! Hello!

21:27.617 --> 21:29.753
Hi!

21:29.787 --> 21:31.255
Oh.

21:31.288 --> 21:34.258
These are for you.
And treats for Henry.

21:34.290 --> 21:36.860
Oh, thank you!
Ooh, dark chocolate.

21:36.894 --> 21:39.963
How did you know?
Let me take your jacket.

21:39.996 --> 21:42.032
That's it.

21:42.066 --> 21:44.202
Now, then, you go on in.

21:44.234 --> 21:46.436
And I'll make some tea.

21:46.470 --> 21:49.540
And, Tillie, Tillie, you come
with me to the kitchen

21:49.572 --> 21:51.376
and you can share
Henry's treats.

21:51.408 --> 21:53.210
Yes, come on.

21:53.243 --> 21:55.079
Good girl.

21:56.213 --> 21:59.517
Come on, Henry. Henry, quickly.

22:01.786 --> 22:03.555
There we are.

22:06.389 --> 22:08.659
Nice cup of tea.

22:08.693 --> 22:11.730
Good. Good.

22:18.234 --> 22:20.103
Is that your daughter?

22:20.136 --> 22:22.072
- Yes.
- Pretty.

22:22.106 --> 22:24.942
Full of life, like her mum.

22:24.974 --> 22:26.343
Maybe once.

22:26.376 --> 22:30.080
Canaries? It's not that far.

22:30.114 --> 22:31.516
Not these days.

22:31.549 --> 22:33.651
It's quicker
than getting to Skegness.

22:33.684 --> 22:35.587
Think of the holidays
you'll have.

22:39.322 --> 22:40.490
Did I say the wrong thing?

22:40.523 --> 22:42.926
Take no notice. I get like this.

22:42.960 --> 22:44.796
I'll pour your tea.

22:48.031 --> 22:49.768
Nice place.

22:50.800 --> 22:53.905
Making the most of it
while I can.

22:54.739 --> 22:59.077
He's given me six months.
Then it goes on the market.

22:59.109 --> 23:00.744
What are you gonna do?

23:00.778 --> 23:05.383
Oh, buy a flat if I can
with my share,

23:05.415 --> 23:08.653
or buy a house
somewhere near my son.

23:08.685 --> 23:11.088
- Would your son like that?
- Probably not.

23:11.121 --> 23:13.290
He worries I'll set him off.

23:13.323 --> 23:15.058
I've seen it happen.

23:15.091 --> 23:17.528
How about some cake?

23:23.166 --> 23:25.336
Do you want to walk
a bit quicker?

23:25.368 --> 23:28.305
Well, I was going slow
because you were.

23:28.338 --> 23:30.006
I like a brisk walk.

23:30.040 --> 23:31.509
I get cold if it's too slow.

23:31.541 --> 23:33.578
- Circulation not what it was.
- Come on, then.

23:33.610 --> 23:35.713
Hurry up!

23:37.414 --> 23:39.550
This is our 12th walk together.

23:39.582 --> 23:42.285
- You've been counting?
- I must have.

23:42.319 --> 23:44.422
Oh, it's not the same,
though, is it?

23:44.454 --> 23:46.456
- All the houses.
- It's fine.

23:46.490 --> 23:48.925
We should go on a proper
country walk for our 13th.

23:48.959 --> 23:52.564
- The dogs would like that.
- I'd like that too.

23:55.198 --> 23:57.801
Oh, could we hold up a minute?

23:59.470 --> 24:02.006
Oh. Oh!

24:06.644 --> 24:08.512
Oh, first couple of walks,

24:08.546 --> 24:10.815
I was scared to death of Tillie.

24:10.848 --> 24:12.450
You didn't show it.

24:12.482 --> 24:15.453
I was scared of you too,
if it comes to that.

24:16.287 --> 24:18.088
And now?

24:18.121 --> 24:20.357
I'm only scared of you.

24:24.828 --> 24:26.897
Can we walk a bit slower?

24:28.598 --> 24:31.299
Come on.

24:34.171 --> 24:35.907
Come on, kids.

24:39.342 --> 24:40.911
- Hi there!
- Hello!

24:40.944 --> 24:42.646
- Morning, all.
- Come on.

24:43.914 --> 24:45.583
- Hello!
- Hi.

24:45.616 --> 24:47.518
- Hello.
- This is Rafe.

24:47.550 --> 24:49.453
This is Sylvie.
They're explorers.

24:49.485 --> 24:52.656
Ooh, that's handy.
Right, climb aboard.

24:54.290 --> 24:56.894
In you go. I'm Fern.

24:56.926 --> 24:58.995
And that's Henry in the boot.

24:59.029 --> 25:01.999
He's an explorer too.

25:02.031 --> 25:03.835
Take the bag, kids.

25:05.269 --> 25:07.471
- You got your belts on OK?
- Yes.

25:07.503 --> 25:10.073
Come on, Tillie. Get in.
Get your tail in.

25:12.376 --> 25:14.478
I've got
plenty of sandwiches.

25:14.511 --> 25:16.180
I've got a ton.

25:16.213 --> 25:17.848
We won't go hungry, then.

25:34.098 --> 25:35.465
It's lovely.

25:35.499 --> 25:37.268
Thank God
for the green belt, eh?

25:54.784 --> 25:56.286
Come on, Tillie!

26:03.426 --> 26:05.862
We did a lot of camping
when the kids were little.

26:05.896 --> 26:07.530
Camping and caravan.

26:07.563 --> 26:09.699
We did package holidays.

26:09.732 --> 26:12.837
Yeah, we were lucky to be able
to afford them, I suppose.

26:12.869 --> 26:14.472
I'm not complaining.

26:14.504 --> 26:16.808
We had a lot of fun.

26:18.207 --> 26:20.811
Did you come here
with your wife?

26:22.146 --> 26:23.915
Yes.

26:23.947 --> 26:25.916
Yes, we did.

26:28.751 --> 26:30.454
You're missing her?

26:31.387 --> 26:33.323
I miss those times.

26:35.125 --> 26:38.396
They don't come back,
do they, except in memories.

26:38.428 --> 26:40.665
- Got plenty of them.
- Come on, Tillie.

26:40.697 --> 26:43.033
Got to keep
making new ones.

26:43.067 --> 26:45.036
That's what I say to myself.

26:45.069 --> 26:48.306
Keep living while we can.

26:49.706 --> 26:51.341
Grandpa, look.

26:56.347 --> 26:58.648
- These are for you.
- Oh, thank you, darling!

26:58.682 --> 27:02.153
- And for you.
- Oh, thank you!

27:02.185 --> 27:04.821
Mmm! Oh, lovely.

27:06.991 --> 27:08.792
I'll remember this.

27:16.066 --> 27:17.702
- Hola.
- Hola.

27:22.005 --> 27:24.040
You need to learn
the Spanish way.

27:24.073 --> 27:25.909
What? Two more of those, is it?

27:31.915 --> 27:33.116
No Henry?

27:33.149 --> 27:36.286
Uh, I fed him before I came out.
He'll be OK for an evening.

27:36.319 --> 27:38.388
Here's my contribution.

27:38.422 --> 27:40.825
- Oh.
- Hello, Tillie.

27:40.857 --> 27:43.027
Hello, beautiful.

27:43.059 --> 27:44.962
Oh, hello.

27:44.994 --> 27:47.197
Come through.

27:47.231 --> 27:49.901
Oh, thank you. Come on.

27:53.904 --> 27:57.607
Romantic. I'm not sure
I'm ready for that.

27:57.640 --> 28:01.411
No pressure.
I just think they look nice.

28:10.587 --> 28:14.157
Hola. Jamaican jerk chicken.

28:14.191 --> 28:17.528
Like my wife made,
only less spicy.

28:21.531 --> 28:24.901
- Wine?
- Oh, er, just half a glass.

28:26.203 --> 28:27.838
Thank you.

28:30.808 --> 28:34.045
I once had Bajan chicken
with Cliff Richard

28:34.078 --> 28:36.680
at an after-show party
he hosted.

28:36.713 --> 28:39.349
Cliff Richard?
Blimey, you get about.

28:39.383 --> 28:41.018
Well, I was a dancer once.

28:41.050 --> 28:42.685
And a singer.

28:42.719 --> 28:45.356
In the chorus.
I was, um, a Tiller Girl.

28:45.388 --> 28:48.224
Sunday night
at the London Palladium.

28:48.258 --> 28:51.462
Well,
don't look so shocked!

28:51.494 --> 28:53.630
I... I was young once.

28:53.664 --> 28:56.666
Who'd have known? A Tiller Girl.

28:56.700 --> 28:59.437
So, you've met them,
all these stars?

28:59.470 --> 29:03.074
Yeah. I met a lot.
Well, you couldn't help it.

29:03.107 --> 29:04.508
Fancy that.

29:04.540 --> 29:07.144
Five minutes ago you were
a lady with a little dog.

29:07.176 --> 29:09.446
- Now...
- Don't get carried away.

29:09.480 --> 29:11.682
I never got famous.

29:11.714 --> 29:13.384
Cheers.

29:14.217 --> 29:15.685
Still, the Palladium.

29:15.719 --> 29:17.755
Has to beat the night shift
at Whipps Cross

29:17.788 --> 29:19.323
with the self-harmers.

29:19.356 --> 29:21.492
Don't be so sure.

29:22.893 --> 29:24.828
Mmm. Looks good.

29:31.835 --> 29:33.804
Since you're a dancer...

29:33.837 --> 29:35.573
A long time ago.

29:35.606 --> 29:37.241
You don't lose it, though.

29:37.273 --> 29:38.641
- Come on.
- No, no, no, no.

29:38.675 --> 29:40.110
Let's see what you're made of.

29:40.144 --> 29:42.947
Just a slow one to start.

29:42.980 --> 29:45.616
- Must we?
- We must.

29:51.655 --> 29:53.290
Wow!

30:05.569 --> 30:07.605
One, two, cha, cha, cha.

30:07.637 --> 30:09.572
One, two,
cha, cha, cha.

30:09.606 --> 30:11.876
Cha, cha, cha.

30:14.043 --> 30:16.579
Cha, cha, cha!

30:18.549 --> 30:20.451
OK, that's the warm-up.

30:20.483 --> 30:22.785
- Are you ready?
- Oh, no!

30:25.923 --> 30:28.259
I'm not stripping off!

30:28.291 --> 30:30.461
♪ Come on, everybody! ♪

30:33.931 --> 30:36.066
♪ Hey! ♪

30:36.098 --> 30:38.368
Cha, cha, cha!

30:40.270 --> 30:41.939
Yeah!

31:24.313 --> 31:26.082
Do you want to stay over?

31:26.116 --> 31:28.652
Not for sex,
just for the company.

31:28.684 --> 31:32.388
To have you there in the morning
when I wake up would be special.

31:32.422 --> 31:34.124
What do you think?

31:34.156 --> 31:37.627
I've got work in the morning,
and then there's Henry.

31:37.661 --> 31:41.299
No worries. Sorry,
I... I should have thought.

31:42.331 --> 31:45.468
Bit sudden. Give me time.

31:47.236 --> 31:50.773
I've not felt this
clumsy since I was a teenager.

31:50.807 --> 31:54.612
I'll probably be
kicking myself when I get home.

31:54.645 --> 31:59.450
I'll be lying there lonely as
a bat in hell, kicking myself.

32:12.729 --> 32:15.132
Oh, no. Not you.
Get back in the house.

32:21.471 --> 32:23.540
- 'Bye.
- 'Bye.

32:25.709 --> 32:27.845
Thank you for a nice evening.

32:27.877 --> 32:29.746
I really enjoyed myself.

32:30.914 --> 32:33.117
<i>I'm glad.</i>

32:33.149 --> 32:35.018
- <i>Sorry if I...</i>
- It's OK.

32:35.051 --> 32:36.819
Are you OK?

32:36.853 --> 32:38.623
<i>I'm more than OK.</i>

32:39.723 --> 32:43.961
<i>Let's video-call.
I'd like to see you.</i>

32:43.993 --> 32:45.928
Really?

32:45.962 --> 32:47.798
We could try.

32:49.098 --> 32:50.701
<i>I'll video-call you.</i>

32:56.505 --> 32:59.909
- Is it working?
- <i>That's it. Lovely.</i>

33:01.677 --> 33:04.415
No improper suggestions, now.

33:04.447 --> 33:07.784
<i>As if I would.
Here's a proper one.</i>

33:10.921 --> 33:12.823
<i>Sing me a song.</i>

33:12.856 --> 33:14.290
What?!

33:14.323 --> 33:17.160
Oh, Dave, you don't know
what you're asking.

33:17.194 --> 33:19.495
I haven't sung in ages.

33:19.529 --> 33:21.565
<i>Go on. Pretend
you're in the bath.</i>

33:21.598 --> 33:23.966
I was never a stripper!

33:24.000 --> 33:26.103
<i>You know what I mean.</i>

33:26.136 --> 33:29.039
You caught me cold,
Dave.

33:29.071 --> 33:30.907
Another time.

33:31.974 --> 33:34.744
<i>Whenever you're ready.</i>

33:36.445 --> 33:39.249
I'll say goodnight now, Dave.

33:39.281 --> 33:41.050
<i>Goodnight, Fern.</i>

33:41.084 --> 33:42.619
See you on the fields.

33:42.652 --> 33:44.455
<i>Thanks for calling, Fern.</i>

33:44.488 --> 33:46.991
- <i>'Bye.</i>
- 'Bye.

33:57.200 --> 33:59.136
Oh, I'm confused, Dave.

33:59.168 --> 34:01.037
I don't know
how to do this anymore.

34:01.070 --> 34:02.539
In my courting days,

34:02.571 --> 34:04.974
the rule for us girls
was to hold back

34:05.008 --> 34:06.410
and keep them wanting more.

34:06.443 --> 34:08.345
Give them hope enough
to stay involved,

34:08.377 --> 34:11.347
but make sure
you always remain one up.

34:11.381 --> 34:13.417
I've been on the wrong end
of that one

34:13.450 --> 34:15.319
more times
than I care to remember.

34:15.352 --> 34:17.321
Well into my 40s, I reckon.

34:17.354 --> 34:20.156
The rule on our side
was to do our best

34:20.189 --> 34:21.892
to persuade them
to let us into their skirts.

34:21.925 --> 34:23.760
I can see where you lot
were coming from.

34:23.794 --> 34:26.030
I don't want
to be like that with you.

34:27.196 --> 34:30.466
If I take it slow, it's not
to be playing silly buggers.

34:30.499 --> 34:32.936
- You understand?
- Yes.

34:34.236 --> 34:36.874
It's because
I seriously like you.

34:37.941 --> 34:40.077
But I was bitten before

34:40.109 --> 34:42.345
and I need to protect myself.

34:42.379 --> 34:45.281
I'm serious too, Fern.

34:45.314 --> 34:47.216
I never imagined.

34:47.249 --> 34:48.885
Dave...

35:24.019 --> 35:25.621
What was that last bit?

35:25.655 --> 35:28.626
I want things to be clear
between us.

35:29.626 --> 35:32.095
I need you to meet someone.

35:32.127 --> 35:34.664
Someone important to me.

35:34.698 --> 35:37.001
Someone you should have
met before.

35:50.146 --> 35:52.048
Hello, Dave.

36:09.899 --> 36:11.635
Hello, love.

36:12.903 --> 36:14.638
How are you?

36:27.551 --> 36:30.787
Marcy. This is my friend, Fern.

36:30.819 --> 36:34.323
The one I told you about,
with the little dog.

36:34.356 --> 36:36.359
Tillie's friend.

36:37.459 --> 36:39.929
Fern, this is Marcy.

36:39.963 --> 36:41.631
My wife.

36:51.274 --> 36:54.712
Nice to meet you. How do you do?

37:06.356 --> 37:08.091
She's been here two years.

37:08.124 --> 37:10.459
It's not bad as these places go.

37:10.493 --> 37:13.731
Wait here. I'll fetch the dogs.

37:43.193 --> 37:45.662
I took care of her
for as long as I could.

37:45.694 --> 37:47.798
Three years.

37:47.830 --> 37:50.800
But it got too much.
My heart started playing up.

37:50.834 --> 37:54.671
It's alright. It's only Tillie.
Your Tillie.

37:54.703 --> 37:57.908
Used to take her to the shops,
church, everywhere.

37:59.109 --> 38:01.278
OK, come on.

38:01.310 --> 38:03.479
Sit down here. Sit down here.

38:03.513 --> 38:06.984
We'll take the dogs away.
Be back in a mo.

38:20.330 --> 38:22.232
How could you
do that to me?

38:22.265 --> 38:23.967
Put me in that position?

38:23.999 --> 38:26.369
It wasn't personal,
her not shaking your hand.

38:26.403 --> 38:27.838
She doesn't know what it means.

38:27.870 --> 38:30.406
I don't give a monkey's
about that!

38:30.439 --> 38:35.044
You land a wife on me
out of nowhere.

38:35.077 --> 38:37.246
How could you keep that
from me?

38:37.280 --> 38:39.383
You lied to me.

38:39.415 --> 38:43.319
The whole time,
every bloody walk we went on,

38:43.352 --> 38:45.321
you were married!

38:45.354 --> 38:47.890
I can't even enjoy the memories.

38:47.923 --> 38:49.825
It was real. Believe me.

38:49.859 --> 38:51.795
How can you say that?

38:53.196 --> 38:55.499
- I'm going.
- No. Fern.

38:55.531 --> 38:57.468
Don't call me!

38:59.468 --> 39:01.338
Do you still want me
to keep Henry

39:01.370 --> 39:03.473
when you go to the Canaries?

39:06.109 --> 39:09.179
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

39:09.211 --> 39:10.914
Fuck!

39:14.050 --> 39:17.187
I'm sorry, Tillie. It's not you.

39:17.220 --> 39:21.591
It's me, your idiot master,
I'm angry with.

39:23.760 --> 39:25.395
Shit.

39:25.428 --> 39:27.564
I should have told you what?

39:27.597 --> 39:30.100
So what if I brought a friend
on a picnic, Donna?

39:30.133 --> 39:31.768
It's not a crime.

39:31.801 --> 39:35.372
I know I have a wife.
Do you think I can forget that?

39:36.171 --> 39:38.040
Anyway, you can relax.

39:38.073 --> 39:41.544
That courtship's gone doolally
before it even started.

39:41.577 --> 39:43.479
I haven't seen her
for weeks now.

39:45.781 --> 39:47.484
It's not your business,
my dear Donna,

39:47.517 --> 39:49.386
to tell me how to run my life.

39:49.419 --> 39:52.022
I'll make my own mess
in my own way, thank you.

39:58.361 --> 40:00.097
Oi! Control your animal,
will you?

40:00.129 --> 40:03.066
You shouldn't be letting her out
in a state like that.

40:03.098 --> 40:05.669
She's long past being in any
state you had in mind, mate.

40:05.702 --> 40:07.870
Come on, Bertie.
Not good enough for you.

40:07.903 --> 40:10.807
No, Daddy's not angry at you.

40:13.609 --> 40:15.979
Come on, Tillie, eh?

40:25.687 --> 40:28.325
Come on, love. Just try
a little bit of water, eh?

40:28.357 --> 40:30.993
Tillie?

40:36.399 --> 40:38.568
I'm behind with the rent.

40:38.600 --> 40:41.571
They called me in for a powwow.

40:43.939 --> 40:45.742
Donna. Hi.

40:48.343 --> 40:50.079
Hello, Mum.

40:51.180 --> 40:53.115
Hi, Dad.

40:53.149 --> 40:54.518
I was just showing your mum

40:54.551 --> 40:56.886
a letter from
the housing office.

40:56.919 --> 40:58.521
You're early.

40:58.555 --> 41:01.258
Yeah. I've got a job interview.
I've gotta prepare.

41:01.290 --> 41:04.294
It's a crap job, Mum. Maybe.

41:07.162 --> 41:09.565
It needs dusting
in here.

41:09.598 --> 41:12.736
I'll talk to Matron.
Mum hates a dirty house.

41:12.769 --> 41:15.839
Don't you, Mum?
Hate a dirty house?

41:17.372 --> 41:19.708
What is the matter with you?

41:19.742 --> 41:22.412
One lousy flower you bring her?
Can't you bring a bunch?

41:22.444 --> 41:24.513
She didn't like me
spending too much on flowers.

41:24.546 --> 41:26.348
She'd rather have
one special one.

41:26.381 --> 41:29.452
Hmm. I'll leave you to it, then.

41:30.620 --> 41:32.455
You still want me
to pick up the kids?

41:32.488 --> 41:35.325
Uh, yeah, if you want.
I'll pick them up from yours?

41:35.357 --> 41:36.993
'Bye, Mum.

41:46.102 --> 41:48.405
Don't do it.
I just say that.

41:48.437 --> 41:50.372
Come on!

41:53.977 --> 41:56.179
Oh!

41:56.211 --> 41:58.080
Ooh!

42:02.151 --> 42:04.254
Where's Tillie?

42:04.287 --> 42:06.823
She's not well.
She's resting in bed.

42:06.856 --> 42:09.626
Like when you take a day off
school when you've got a cold.

42:09.658 --> 42:11.493
- Mum usually makes us go.
- Oh.

42:11.526 --> 42:13.664
Where's your friend? That woman?

42:16.832 --> 42:18.535
She was nice.

42:35.350 --> 42:37.453
Thank you.

43:00.542 --> 43:03.345
You can't make me homeless.
I'm a secure tenant.

43:03.379 --> 43:06.883
We could, Mr Simmonds,
if we wanted to.

43:06.915 --> 43:08.684
We've given you two warnings

43:08.718 --> 43:10.453
and you keep falling
further behind.

43:10.486 --> 43:12.055
I'm doing my best.

43:12.088 --> 43:15.524
That's why we'll help you
find a new home, Mr Simmonds.

43:15.557 --> 43:18.961
I want MY home,
not any old home.

43:20.495 --> 43:23.232
My wife's care costs,
the council don't cover it.

43:23.265 --> 43:25.868
I lost pension when I quit
to look after her.

43:25.901 --> 43:28.938
We'll find you a smaller place.
The rent will be lower.

43:28.972 --> 43:33.075
We're going to renovate and
modernise your existing home.

43:33.109 --> 43:34.778
I've already modernised it.

43:34.810 --> 43:37.414
And then we'll re-let it

43:37.446 --> 43:39.883
to a two-income working family.

43:39.915 --> 43:41.651
You'd be helping people out.

43:41.684 --> 43:44.386
I can just imagine
the rent you're gonna charge

43:44.419 --> 43:46.155
when that's all done.

43:46.189 --> 43:49.859
I've never been behind before.
30 years.

43:49.892 --> 43:51.694
I'll make it up.

43:51.727 --> 43:53.896
How, Mr Simmonds?

43:53.930 --> 43:55.799
When...

43:58.633 --> 44:00.369
When...

44:09.544 --> 44:11.814
Where do you want to move me?

44:11.847 --> 44:13.515
Um, we have access

44:13.548 --> 44:15.751
to some first-class
accommodation for singles

44:15.785 --> 44:18.754
in Luton,
if you fancy a new start.

44:18.787 --> 44:20.423
You're joking.

44:20.455 --> 44:22.024
Closer to hand, we have

44:22.057 --> 44:24.626
more temporary accommodation
outside of borough.

44:24.660 --> 44:27.464
We have some suitable properties
in Chingford.

44:27.497 --> 44:29.598
That's still miles away.

44:29.631 --> 44:32.202
Until we find somewhere locally.

44:32.234 --> 44:33.669
How long's that gonna take?

44:33.702 --> 44:35.271
We've got
a brownfield development

44:35.303 --> 44:37.272
going through the planning
process now.

44:37.305 --> 44:40.042
Three years, say,
if everyone hits their targets.

44:40.075 --> 44:41.810
My wife's here.
My grandchildren.

44:41.843 --> 44:45.080
Perhaps you'd like to go for
the Chingford option, then.

46:06.863 --> 46:08.364
Henry!

46:08.397 --> 46:10.066
You rapscallion! Here!

46:12.200 --> 46:14.804
- Now, where's your missus?
- Henry!

46:36.225 --> 46:38.828
- Hola.
- Hola.

46:40.196 --> 46:43.232
Long time no see. Qué tal?

46:43.265 --> 46:45.468
Bien.

46:45.501 --> 46:48.437
You're a sight for sore eyes.

46:49.238 --> 46:50.807
Am I allowed to say that?

46:50.839 --> 46:52.642
No.

46:56.011 --> 46:58.414
- Where's Tillie?
- Sick.

46:58.446 --> 47:00.483
But you've come out anyway.

47:01.450 --> 47:03.685
Got to keep up the exercise.

47:03.718 --> 47:05.554
How bad is she?

47:05.588 --> 47:07.089
Not good.

47:07.122 --> 47:09.992
Vet said it could be a tumour.

47:10.792 --> 47:13.629
But it wouldn't be doing her
any favours opening her up.

47:13.662 --> 47:15.365
Poor Tillie.

47:18.033 --> 47:19.769
Better go.

47:21.169 --> 47:23.740
Give her a kiss from me.

47:28.109 --> 47:29.879
How was the wedding?

47:31.046 --> 47:34.516
Not easy.
The ex was omnipresent.

47:34.550 --> 47:37.319
But Gran Canaria was lovely

47:37.352 --> 47:39.254
and the family were
very welcoming,

47:39.287 --> 47:41.323
so I ended up staying longer.

47:41.356 --> 47:43.359
Can I say something?

47:45.995 --> 47:47.931
About us.

47:47.964 --> 47:49.866
I owe you an explanation.

47:50.700 --> 47:53.636
You took me for a ride, Dave,
is all I know.

47:54.870 --> 47:56.606
Go on, then.

47:57.807 --> 48:01.243
I was so much enjoying
getting to know you.

48:01.276 --> 48:03.845
After all those years
caring for Marcy,

48:03.879 --> 48:06.683
it was magic being in
a proper relationship.

48:08.484 --> 48:11.020
I didn't want to risk losing it.

48:11.053 --> 48:13.256
You. Losing you.

48:13.289 --> 48:14.890
You lied to me.

48:14.923 --> 48:16.492
I justified it to myself.

48:16.524 --> 48:19.261
She did pass on for me,
in a way.

48:19.294 --> 48:21.129
I've had to grieve
the person I knew.

48:21.162 --> 48:23.932
Fuck it, Dave,
you hid a wife from me.

48:23.966 --> 48:26.669
I'm used to compartmentalising.

48:26.702 --> 48:29.071
As a nurse you have to
keep things separate.

48:29.104 --> 48:30.873
You're trained to.

48:32.341 --> 48:34.477
I wanted to tell you.

48:34.510 --> 48:37.379
I nearly did a few times.

48:37.412 --> 48:40.516
The longer I left it,
the harder it got.

48:41.917 --> 48:43.653
I'm sorry.

48:45.086 --> 48:47.489
That's it. I've said it.

48:47.522 --> 48:49.593
Thanks for listening.

48:52.694 --> 48:55.365
I would like to visit Tillie.

48:57.566 --> 49:00.636
Go on through. Excuse the mess.

49:05.106 --> 49:07.609
Hello, Tillie.

49:07.642 --> 49:09.345
It's OK.

49:09.377 --> 49:11.548
Aw.

49:13.082 --> 49:16.019
OK. OK.

49:16.051 --> 49:18.021
Say hello.

49:24.693 --> 49:26.362
Good girl.

49:31.801 --> 49:34.871
What's all this, Dave?

49:34.903 --> 49:37.406
No secrets, please.

49:38.841 --> 49:41.778
They kicked me out of the house,
end of November.

49:43.245 --> 49:45.348
They're gonna tart this place up

49:45.381 --> 49:48.318
and rent it out
for as much as they can get.

49:48.350 --> 49:51.086
They're sending me off
to Siberia.

49:51.120 --> 49:53.556
- Sorry. Luton.
- They can't do that.

49:53.589 --> 49:56.492
They can and they are.
Luton or Chingford.

49:56.524 --> 49:58.994
You've given your life
to public service.

49:59.028 --> 50:00.495
It's not right.

50:00.528 --> 50:01.997
If they just give me, you know,

50:02.031 --> 50:04.267
a nice little one-bedroom flat
somewhere in the area,

50:04.300 --> 50:06.368
I could live with it.

50:06.401 --> 50:08.737
But they can't, 'cause
they're pulling them down.

50:10.638 --> 50:13.510
Blimey. Lazarus has risen.

50:15.778 --> 50:19.448
I swear, she hasn't
eaten anything for ages.

50:19.481 --> 50:21.650
She's hardly stood up.

50:21.684 --> 50:24.854
I've more or less had to carry
her out to do her business.

50:26.421 --> 50:29.958
It's you and Henry.
You bucked her right up.

50:31.426 --> 50:33.363
Nice to imagine.

50:33.396 --> 50:35.631
I'm glad she's eating, anyway.

50:37.332 --> 50:39.568
I hope she can keep it down.

50:40.502 --> 50:43.138
Maybe later we could take her
out for a little walk,

50:43.171 --> 50:44.973
if you don't mind
sticking around.

50:47.008 --> 50:48.777
For a few minutes.

50:53.816 --> 50:57.754
Why were you on the fields,
Dave, without a dog?

50:57.787 --> 50:59.856
Tell me.

50:59.888 --> 51:02.024
As I said, for the exercise.

51:04.093 --> 51:06.062
I had in mind I might catch you.

51:07.296 --> 51:08.732
Just in case.

51:09.832 --> 51:11.968
In case of what?

51:14.370 --> 51:16.339
In case you might forget me.

51:30.285 --> 51:33.255
I've had a lot of time
to myself.

51:33.289 --> 51:35.691
A lot of time to think.

51:36.859 --> 51:39.127
I thought, "I met a man.

51:39.160 --> 51:41.863
"We had the chance of something.

51:41.897 --> 51:44.768
"Friendship, companionship.

51:45.868 --> 51:47.437
"Love, even.

51:47.470 --> 51:50.839
"He blew it, big-time.

51:50.872 --> 51:52.707
"I was very disappointed.

51:52.740 --> 51:56.011
"I'm going to be very cautious
because of what he did.

51:57.312 --> 51:59.481
"But I do believe he's sorry."

52:00.415 --> 52:02.751
What are you saying?

52:02.785 --> 52:06.088
I don't know, Dave, and
I'm still thinking about it.

52:06.120 --> 52:08.124
I heard what you said.

52:08.156 --> 52:10.059
Don't push me.

52:10.091 --> 52:12.561
No. So...?

52:12.595 --> 52:15.198
I'll be on the fields tomorrow.

52:15.231 --> 52:17.499
- Let's see.
- Really?

52:18.901 --> 52:20.669
Really.

52:25.673 --> 52:28.510
There. Good boy.

52:28.544 --> 52:30.746
Good boy, Henry.

52:41.990 --> 52:44.493
I don't forgive myself.

52:44.526 --> 52:46.396
Good.

53:01.644 --> 53:03.847
She's walking
a lot better.

53:05.046 --> 53:07.349
Dave, I want to say something.

53:08.484 --> 53:10.553
Should I
get my armour out?

53:11.553 --> 53:15.857
My response to Marcy -
I wasn't very kind.

53:15.890 --> 53:17.659
Thinking about it,

53:17.693 --> 53:19.528
what you must have been through,

53:19.562 --> 53:21.631
and now what it's costing you...

53:21.664 --> 53:24.934
No, you had a right
to respond the way you did.

53:24.966 --> 53:26.368
I misled you.

53:26.401 --> 53:28.637
Well, I'm sorry.

53:28.671 --> 53:31.640
I can't imagine
how hard it must have been.

53:31.673 --> 53:33.408
Is.

53:34.877 --> 53:36.379
Thank you.

54:07.443 --> 54:09.511
What?

54:15.917 --> 54:17.720
Wait.

56:12.533 --> 56:15.470
Bravo! Bravo! Magnífico!

56:15.504 --> 56:20.309
Magnífico! Bravo!
Magnífico! Bravo!

56:28.883 --> 56:31.653
I've just got to get something
from the car.

56:34.222 --> 56:36.224
Come on, you two.

56:47.401 --> 56:50.505
Toothbrush, nightie,
dressing gown,

56:50.539 --> 56:53.374
work clothes,
change of knickers, doggy bowl.

56:53.408 --> 56:55.877
I'm not moving in.

56:55.910 --> 56:58.414
Women. Beyond comprehension.

57:01.048 --> 57:02.784
Come on, get in.

57:02.818 --> 57:05.421
Get in, go on.

57:09.357 --> 57:11.760
I better change the sheets.

57:11.794 --> 57:13.729
Uh, no sex, Dave.

57:13.761 --> 57:17.432
No, of course not.
Just being together's good.

57:22.303 --> 57:24.039
For the moment.

57:24.071 --> 57:26.408
You were bloody amazing.

57:55.303 --> 57:57.238
Oh, you're good.

57:57.272 --> 57:59.175
I used to be a nurse.

57:59.207 --> 58:01.443
I could do this in my sleep.

58:01.475 --> 58:04.780
A man who change the sheets -
every woman's dream.

58:04.812 --> 58:07.048
And here's me
worrying about my pecs.

58:07.082 --> 58:08.885
Oh, they count too.

58:33.542 --> 58:35.477
Blimey, that's a bit noisy.

58:35.510 --> 58:37.812
You get used to it.

58:37.845 --> 58:39.447
Never.

58:39.481 --> 58:41.651
What's wrong with
a bit of elbow grease?

59:01.336 --> 59:03.504
You coming, love?

59:03.537 --> 59:05.440
In a mo.

59:56.191 --> 59:58.560
It's nice to know
you're there now.

59:58.593 --> 1:00:00.763
You'll still be there
in the morning.

1:00:02.064 --> 1:00:03.799
You hope.

1:00:05.734 --> 1:00:07.536
You alright?

1:00:08.736 --> 1:00:10.539
I'm fine.

1:00:11.906 --> 1:00:13.709
So much I don't know.

1:00:17.713 --> 1:00:21.082
We've both lived a lot of life,
haven't we?

1:00:25.053 --> 1:00:26.856
Here's a question.

1:00:27.955 --> 1:00:30.425
Where's your favourite place
in the world?

1:00:31.760 --> 1:00:33.162
In the world?

1:00:33.194 --> 1:00:35.330
Yes.

1:00:40.002 --> 1:00:41.938
I haven't found it yet.

1:00:44.106 --> 1:00:46.609
Somewhere inside me, I think.

1:01:04.926 --> 1:01:07.429
Have you been
looking at me long?

1:01:07.461 --> 1:01:09.130
A little while.

1:01:09.164 --> 1:01:10.999
Looking at your neck.

1:01:11.033 --> 1:01:13.368
It's a good neck.

1:01:14.803 --> 1:01:16.739
Thank you.

1:01:16.772 --> 1:01:18.374
Do you want a cuppa?

1:01:18.406 --> 1:01:20.309
I'll bring one up if you want.

1:01:20.341 --> 1:01:22.310
No. I'll come down.

1:02:13.260 --> 1:02:15.163
Do you want milk
with your muesli?

1:02:15.196 --> 1:02:18.367
I've got semi-skimmed.

1:02:19.533 --> 1:02:21.736
I'll get soy for next time.

1:02:29.778 --> 1:02:31.513
Here you are.

1:02:46.428 --> 1:02:48.430
All bases covered.

1:02:48.463 --> 1:02:52.200
Heart, liver, stomach,
kidney, pancreas,

1:02:52.234 --> 1:02:54.470
muscles, joints,
lymphatic system,

1:02:54.502 --> 1:02:57.338
nervous system, brain.

1:02:57.372 --> 1:02:59.140
I'm glad you've got that one
dealt with.

1:02:59.173 --> 1:03:01.342
- There's no guarantee.
- Don't I know it.

1:03:01.376 --> 1:03:03.644
Get stuck it.
It won't eat itself.

1:03:24.432 --> 1:03:26.267
My lady and my gracious lord.

1:03:26.301 --> 1:03:28.069
Ah!

1:03:29.271 --> 1:03:31.039
Methinks.

1:03:31.071 --> 1:03:32.573
My ladyship.

1:03:35.377 --> 1:03:37.379
- My lady.
- My lady.

1:03:37.412 --> 1:03:39.348
My sweet lady.

1:03:41.716 --> 1:03:44.353
My lord.

1:03:59.834 --> 1:04:01.403
Hello, Dave.

1:04:01.435 --> 1:04:03.472
<i>Hello, Fern?</i>

1:04:03.504 --> 1:04:06.707
<i>You said you'd call me.
I've been waiting for your call.</i>

1:04:06.740 --> 1:04:09.544
Oh, sorry. I... I... I got busy.

1:04:09.577 --> 1:04:12.079
I had to cover for someone.

1:04:12.113 --> 1:04:14.015
<i>I got worried.</i>

1:04:14.048 --> 1:04:16.117
<i>Maybe you'd had enough of me.</i>

1:04:16.151 --> 1:04:18.453
No, it's not you. It's just...

1:04:21.656 --> 1:04:23.258
Come tomorrow.

1:04:23.290 --> 1:04:25.026
You come to me this time.

1:04:35.303 --> 1:04:37.506
This is nice.

1:04:37.539 --> 1:04:39.874
Nicer now you're in it.

1:04:41.743 --> 1:04:45.113
- I got my moving date.
- When?

1:04:45.146 --> 1:04:46.714
Next month.

1:04:46.747 --> 1:04:50.017
Watch out, Chingford!
Big Dave's on his way.

1:04:51.553 --> 1:04:54.423
I can't solve
your housing problems, Dave.

1:04:55.289 --> 1:04:57.425
Nor I yours.

1:04:59.260 --> 1:05:01.396
You can give me a cuddle.

1:05:02.964 --> 1:05:04.433
Come here.

1:05:08.803 --> 1:05:10.739
I fancy you rotten.

1:05:12.473 --> 1:05:14.376
Well, kiss me, then.

1:05:39.801 --> 1:05:41.670
It's gone.

1:05:54.783 --> 1:05:56.485
Don't.

1:05:59.453 --> 1:06:01.555
What's the matter?

1:06:01.589 --> 1:06:03.659
Nothing.

1:06:03.691 --> 1:06:05.894
I've lost it.

1:06:05.926 --> 1:06:08.262
It's all a bit sudden.

1:06:08.296 --> 1:06:10.866
I'm sorry.

1:06:30.651 --> 1:06:32.820
Oh.

1:06:40.562 --> 1:06:42.830
I need my power tools. I think
they're under the stairs.

1:06:42.863 --> 1:06:45.533
Help yourself.
I haven't touched them.

1:06:45.566 --> 1:06:47.401
You've acquired another beast,
I see.

1:06:47.435 --> 1:06:50.806
- Is it safe?
- Tillie wouldn't hurt anyone.

1:06:50.839 --> 1:06:52.574
She's not mine.

1:06:59.481 --> 1:07:00.948
What's he doing here?

1:07:00.981 --> 1:07:05.086
He's my friend.
Dave, this is Jimmy, my ex.

1:07:05.120 --> 1:07:07.089
Morning!

1:07:07.122 --> 1:07:08.857
Hello.

1:07:10.191 --> 1:07:12.560
- Got everything?
- For the moment, yeah.

1:07:12.593 --> 1:07:14.428
Yeah. There's fresh coffee.

1:07:14.461 --> 1:07:16.764
You're joking.

1:07:18.232 --> 1:07:21.236
Thinking of bringing the sale
forward.

1:07:25.205 --> 1:07:27.075
See what I mean?

1:07:29.310 --> 1:07:31.346
He wasn't always that bad.

1:07:31.379 --> 1:07:33.882
Or maybe I just couldn't see it.

1:07:33.914 --> 1:07:37.318
He wanted a good time.
I was up for that.

1:07:37.352 --> 1:07:39.521
For a while.

1:07:39.553 --> 1:07:41.856
But it's not enough,
though, is it?

1:07:41.890 --> 1:07:43.525
You need more than that
from someone,

1:07:43.557 --> 1:07:45.260
especially when
you're getting older.

1:07:45.292 --> 1:07:46.794
You do.

1:07:46.827 --> 1:07:50.564
But needing more makes it feel
more of a risk.

1:07:50.597 --> 1:07:52.099
Exactly.

1:07:52.133 --> 1:07:54.069
That's 80 quid, please.

1:07:54.102 --> 1:07:56.839
Cheap at the price.

1:07:58.772 --> 1:08:01.609
Morning, George.
You're not dead yet?

1:08:01.642 --> 1:08:04.745
Doing my best.
You sick or visiting?

1:08:04.778 --> 1:08:06.514
Volunteering. Maybe.

1:08:06.548 --> 1:08:09.818
Seriously?
You must be soft in the head.

1:08:09.850 --> 1:08:11.318
They should admit you.

1:08:11.352 --> 1:08:14.022
God bless, mate. See you later.

1:08:16.391 --> 1:08:19.628
I went to see if I could do
voluntary counselling

1:08:19.660 --> 1:08:21.195
at the hospital.

1:08:21.229 --> 1:08:23.064
You'd be good.

1:08:23.096 --> 1:08:25.199
Nah, they won't let me.

1:08:25.232 --> 1:08:27.235
I don't have
the qualifications.

1:08:27.267 --> 1:08:29.703
Oh, that's nuts.

1:08:29.736 --> 1:08:32.841
All your experience
going to waste.

1:08:32.873 --> 1:08:36.610
You'd think they'd be crying out
for people like you.

1:08:36.644 --> 1:08:40.048
Maybe keeping an eye for out
Marcy is all I'm good for.

1:08:44.619 --> 1:08:47.389
I don't want to share you, Dave.

1:08:48.388 --> 1:08:50.659
I could do away with her.

1:08:51.993 --> 1:08:53.528
There's times I've felt like it.

1:08:53.561 --> 1:08:55.531
Oh, don't talk rubbish.

1:08:56.597 --> 1:08:58.699
You still love her, don't you?

1:08:58.732 --> 1:09:01.069
Yes, of course.

1:09:02.470 --> 1:09:04.673
But not in the way
I feel about you.

1:09:05.973 --> 1:09:09.011
That's what every man
with a mistress says.

1:09:11.279 --> 1:09:13.415
Be my mistress, then, eh?

1:09:15.083 --> 1:09:17.419
Sorry. Joke.

1:09:20.687 --> 1:09:22.891
With her, it's about the past.

1:09:25.526 --> 1:09:28.830
With you, it's about... now.

1:09:52.553 --> 1:09:55.323
- Is she here?
- No.

1:09:55.355 --> 1:09:57.124
You coming in or what?

1:09:57.158 --> 1:09:59.160
The children say
they saw her car here.

1:09:59.193 --> 1:10:01.329
She was. She works mornings.

1:10:01.361 --> 1:10:03.765
She's gone to work now.
Do you want a coffee?

1:10:03.797 --> 1:10:06.331
It's not right, Dad.
It's gotta stop.

1:10:06.333 --> 1:10:08.302
I'm sorry you feel that.

1:10:08.336 --> 1:10:11.506
I know you're lonely.
Who's not lonely?

1:10:11.538 --> 1:10:12.973
But Mum is still alive.

1:10:13.007 --> 1:10:15.710
She's still a person.
She's still your wife.

1:10:15.743 --> 1:10:19.314
It's company, Donna.
It's not like you think it is.

1:10:19.346 --> 1:10:22.550
Meet her. Do that for us.

1:10:22.583 --> 1:10:24.885
Meet her first,
and then make your mind up.

1:10:24.918 --> 1:10:26.354
No, you're not listening, Dad.

1:10:26.387 --> 1:10:29.291
She could be Mother Teresa.
It makes no difference.

1:10:29.324 --> 1:10:32.360
My mother might not be
the woman she was,

1:10:32.392 --> 1:10:34.629
but she still deserves respect.

1:10:41.202 --> 1:10:43.704
Donna thinks I'm selfish...

1:10:44.739 --> 1:10:47.107
..that I spent my life
looking after nutcases

1:10:47.141 --> 1:10:49.377
and I've never had any time
for her.

1:10:49.409 --> 1:10:52.146
The fact is
I thought the world of her.

1:10:52.180 --> 1:10:54.382
She seemed happy enough.

1:10:54.414 --> 1:10:56.618
So, she's probably right.

1:10:56.650 --> 1:10:59.320
I didn't give her the attention.

1:10:59.354 --> 1:11:01.789
We all make mistakes.

1:11:03.091 --> 1:11:05.193
She won't let it go.

1:11:05.226 --> 1:11:06.928
She thinks I should
stop seeing you.

1:11:06.961 --> 1:11:08.495
Bloody hell, Dave!

1:11:08.529 --> 1:11:10.531
It's none of her business,
is it?

1:11:10.565 --> 1:11:12.568
That's what I keep telling her.

1:11:16.204 --> 1:11:19.741
Your bloody family,
all over you.

1:11:21.074 --> 1:11:23.310
I should never have told you
now.

1:11:23.343 --> 1:11:26.614
No wonder you lost it
the other night.

1:11:26.647 --> 1:11:28.449
Give us a break.

1:11:28.482 --> 1:11:30.217
I wasn't ready, that's all.

1:11:30.251 --> 1:11:32.119
You took me by surprise.

1:11:32.153 --> 1:11:34.155
No, you haven't done with her.

1:11:34.187 --> 1:11:36.857
You couldn't bear
to be unfaithful.

1:11:36.891 --> 1:11:38.760
Not so.

1:11:38.793 --> 1:11:40.629
Leave it, lovey.

1:11:43.463 --> 1:11:45.700
We should take some time out.

1:11:47.235 --> 1:11:49.704
Time out?
We've just got started.

1:11:49.736 --> 1:11:51.405
How much time
do you think we've got?

1:11:51.439 --> 1:11:54.709
I think so, Dave.
It's all got too complicated.

1:11:54.742 --> 1:11:56.945
Come on, Henry.

1:11:56.977 --> 1:11:58.747
Come.

1:11:58.779 --> 1:12:00.414
Fern!

1:12:02.784 --> 1:12:05.387
Fern, come back!

1:12:07.355 --> 1:12:09.524
At least let's talk about it!

1:13:39.379 --> 1:13:41.815
Oh, you guys get heavier
every week!

1:13:41.848 --> 1:13:44.552
Who gave you permission
to grow up so fast?

1:13:44.584 --> 1:13:46.921
- Nobody!
- Well, stop it, will you?

1:13:46.954 --> 1:13:48.423
Or I won't be able to carry you.

1:13:48.455 --> 1:13:49.923
We can't. It just happens.

1:13:49.957 --> 1:13:52.494
You'll have to get stronger.
Maybe work out.

1:13:52.526 --> 1:13:55.230
Work out? You won't catch me
doing that.

1:13:55.262 --> 1:13:57.131
No way!

1:13:58.699 --> 1:14:01.369
Mm, this is a weird one.

1:14:03.037 --> 1:14:04.705
Whoa.

1:14:12.012 --> 1:14:14.515
House is gone.

1:14:18.785 --> 1:14:20.922
I've got these photos
from the fridge.

1:14:23.723 --> 1:14:25.092
Look.

1:14:25.126 --> 1:14:27.561
There's me and you
on our wedding day.

1:14:27.595 --> 1:14:29.463
Look at that jacket.

1:14:29.497 --> 1:14:32.334
I don't know
what I was thinking.

1:14:35.802 --> 1:14:38.806
There's Delroy.
His Christmas jumper.

1:14:40.274 --> 1:14:42.377
Look.

1:14:42.409 --> 1:14:44.712
There's Donna as a baby.

1:15:18.879 --> 1:15:20.914
Hello, Fern?

1:15:20.948 --> 1:15:23.051
I needed to hear your voice.

1:15:23.083 --> 1:15:25.019
<i>How's the new place?</i>

1:15:25.052 --> 1:15:27.555
It's fine. How are you?

1:15:27.587 --> 1:15:29.056
<i>OK.</i>

1:15:29.089 --> 1:15:30.658
<i>This is difficult.</i>

1:15:30.690 --> 1:15:33.193
Do you want to go for a walk?
Not to stay over.

1:15:33.226 --> 1:15:36.263
Just to walk and talk.
I'd like to see you.

1:15:36.297 --> 1:15:38.633
<i>No, Dave. It's too hard.</i>

1:15:39.766 --> 1:15:42.537
OK. So be it.

1:15:44.137 --> 1:15:46.406
I'm angry, Fern,

1:15:46.440 --> 1:15:48.409
at myself for being so clumsy.

1:15:48.441 --> 1:15:50.544
And I'm angry at you
for walking away again.

1:15:50.578 --> 1:15:52.213
It was just an argument.
It didn't warrant...

1:15:52.245 --> 1:15:54.281
<i>I don't want to have
this conversation.</i>

1:15:54.315 --> 1:15:56.584
It wasn't perfect
between me and Marcy.

1:15:56.617 --> 1:16:00.221
Since she found God,
I came second in her life.

1:16:00.253 --> 1:16:02.522
She never accepted
Delroy's gayness.

1:16:02.556 --> 1:16:05.426
Can't you get it through your
head you're not second-best?

1:16:05.458 --> 1:16:08.363
- <i>Please, Dave, stop.</i>
- You told me you lose faith.

1:16:08.395 --> 1:16:11.498
Whatever it was that happened,
you have to understand,

1:16:11.531 --> 1:16:15.035
I'm loyal, and if you let me
love you, that's it.

1:16:15.069 --> 1:16:16.905
I won't disappear.

1:16:18.705 --> 1:16:20.876
But eventually
I'll get the message.

1:16:21.876 --> 1:16:25.547
The day will come when you
wonder why you pushed me away.

1:16:26.513 --> 1:16:28.415
And I won't be there.

1:16:40.293 --> 1:16:43.297
I've blown it.

1:16:44.230 --> 1:16:45.833
Yes.

1:16:47.068 --> 1:16:49.436
I'm on my way to visit her now.

1:16:50.637 --> 1:16:54.708
Hospital?
Why send her to hospital?

1:16:56.142 --> 1:16:57.979
Pneumonia?

1:16:58.012 --> 1:16:59.480
Yes, I know.

1:16:59.512 --> 1:17:01.515
I used to be a nurse, remember?

1:17:03.050 --> 1:17:04.552
I'll make my way there now.

1:17:04.584 --> 1:17:07.355
She's on an antibiotic drip.

1:17:07.387 --> 1:17:09.790
She's very confused,
so we had to sedate her.

1:17:09.824 --> 1:17:12.627
- She's very weak.
- 35 years, she was a nurse.

1:17:12.659 --> 1:17:14.861
'Dedicated' doesn't begin
to describe her.

1:17:14.895 --> 1:17:17.265
There are two in front of her
waiting for a bed.

1:17:17.297 --> 1:17:19.166
I'll make sure she has one
by the morning.

1:17:19.199 --> 1:17:21.135
It's now she needs it.

1:17:21.168 --> 1:17:22.770
Who's allocating tonight?

1:17:22.802 --> 1:17:26.340
Let me speak to them.
I used to be a nurse.

1:17:26.373 --> 1:17:29.142
I'll bet there's a private bed
on stand-by.

1:17:29.176 --> 1:17:31.111
You can try. OK?

1:17:31.145 --> 1:17:34.649
You better get rid
of the flowers.

1:17:35.815 --> 1:17:37.618
You'd think I know that.

1:18:33.940 --> 1:18:36.276
<i>Shall I come, Dad?</i>

1:18:36.310 --> 1:18:37.979
Whatever you want to do, love.

1:18:38.012 --> 1:18:41.449
<i>To tell the truth,
I said my goodbyes last summer.</i>

1:18:41.481 --> 1:18:44.017
<i>She didn't know me from Adam
even then.</i>

1:18:44.051 --> 1:18:45.820
<i>Plus the fare and...</i>

1:18:45.852 --> 1:18:47.555
If it's a question of money,
I'll help.

1:18:47.587 --> 1:18:49.022
Don't worry about that.

1:18:49.056 --> 1:18:52.460
<i>It's you I'm worried about, Dad.
That'd be my reason to come.</i>

1:18:52.493 --> 1:18:55.363
Don't worry about me. I'm good.

1:18:55.395 --> 1:18:57.164
<i>You'd tell me if you weren't?</i>

1:18:57.198 --> 1:18:58.966
I would. I promise.

1:19:43.744 --> 1:19:46.815
Henry! Go away! Go!

1:20:15.441 --> 1:20:17.511
She was a strong believer.

1:20:17.544 --> 1:20:19.446
She'd like a prayer said.

1:20:23.249 --> 1:20:24.752
Support us, O Lord,

1:20:24.784 --> 1:20:27.721
all the day long
in this troublesome life,

1:20:27.754 --> 1:20:33.060
till the shadows lengthen
and the evening comes,

1:20:33.092 --> 1:20:35.696
the busy world is hushed...

1:20:36.896 --> 1:20:39.833
..the fever of life is over

1:20:39.867 --> 1:20:41.936
and our work is done.

1:20:43.337 --> 1:20:47.208
And then, Lord, in your mercy,

1:20:47.240 --> 1:20:50.243
grant us a safe lodging,

1:20:50.276 --> 1:20:52.346
a holy rest

1:20:52.378 --> 1:20:55.849
and peace at the last.

1:21:16.669 --> 1:21:18.405
Hello?

1:21:18.439 --> 1:21:20.841
She's rallied, did you say?

1:21:20.873 --> 1:21:22.510
Yes.

1:21:22.543 --> 1:21:24.445
She always had a strong heart.

1:21:25.445 --> 1:21:28.550
Temperature's down.
That's good to hear.

1:21:30.284 --> 1:21:33.187
I'll be along
as soon as I can make it.

1:21:33.220 --> 1:21:34.888
OK, thank you.

1:21:39.293 --> 1:21:41.496
Are you having a joke with me
or what?

1:21:42.329 --> 1:21:44.332
I don't have
your sense of humour.

1:22:21.267 --> 1:22:23.703
Zap! Pow!

1:22:23.736 --> 1:22:25.472
Pow! Zap!

1:22:27.274 --> 1:22:29.843
Pow! Pow!

1:22:29.877 --> 1:22:31.646
Zap!

1:22:33.413 --> 1:22:36.516
- Come on, Tillie, get up.
- Leave her be.

1:22:36.550 --> 1:22:38.151
She needs to lie down.

1:22:38.185 --> 1:22:40.053
Is she pretending to be shot?

1:22:40.087 --> 1:22:41.756
I wish.

1:22:43.089 --> 1:22:44.958
There you go, girl.

1:22:44.992 --> 1:22:47.928
You rest up a bit
and then we'll take you home.

1:23:03.543 --> 1:23:05.479
Get your strength up.

1:23:43.516 --> 1:23:46.453
Steady, girl.

1:23:48.955 --> 1:23:50.857
Easy.

1:23:54.360 --> 1:23:56.564
They say call a friend.

1:23:59.031 --> 1:24:00.767
Let's try.

1:24:04.904 --> 1:24:06.339
<i>Hello? Dave?</i>

1:24:06.373 --> 1:24:07.908
Don't hang up, please.

1:24:07.940 --> 1:24:11.678
I've got an emergency.
I need some advice.

1:24:11.712 --> 1:24:13.314
<i>What?</i>

1:24:13.346 --> 1:24:15.248
It's Tillie.

1:24:15.281 --> 1:24:17.485
I think she's on her way out.

1:24:17.517 --> 1:24:19.854
I'm not sure what to do.

1:24:19.887 --> 1:24:21.822
It's driving me a bit potty.

1:24:21.855 --> 1:24:24.290
<i>Oh, Dave. Oh, poor you.</i>

1:24:24.324 --> 1:24:26.494
<i>Poor Tillie.</i>

1:24:26.526 --> 1:24:30.263
Maybe it'd be a kindness to her
if I called in the vet.

1:24:30.297 --> 1:24:33.234
<i>Can... can I talk to her?</i>

1:24:33.266 --> 1:24:35.435
Yes.

1:24:45.479 --> 1:24:49.482
If you switch to FaceTime,
I'll do the same here,

1:24:49.516 --> 1:24:52.387
and then you can see her.

1:24:53.320 --> 1:24:57.992
<i>Dear Tillie,
we... we love you so much.</i>

1:24:58.025 --> 1:25:01.328
<i>But we aren't holding on to you.</i>

1:25:01.360 --> 1:25:05.632
<i>If it's your time,
it's alright to go.</i>

1:25:06.432 --> 1:25:08.202
<i>Dave will be OK.</i>

1:25:12.905 --> 1:25:14.809
- She's gone.
- <i>Oh!</i>

1:25:14.842 --> 1:25:16.711
<i>Oh.</i>

1:25:24.918 --> 1:25:26.621
There's no pulse.

1:25:28.221 --> 1:25:29.923
She went while you were talking.

1:25:30.958 --> 1:25:32.827
<i>Really?</i>

1:25:32.860 --> 1:25:34.862
That very moment.

1:25:35.762 --> 1:25:38.699
- <i>Bloody hell.</i>
- Can't believe it.

1:25:40.033 --> 1:25:42.903
<i>I had a feeling.</i>

1:25:42.936 --> 1:25:44.672
<i>Are you OK?</i>

1:25:53.145 --> 1:25:55.782
- Hi, Dave. Alright?
- Hey.

1:25:55.815 --> 1:25:57.517
- Yeah.
- Where's Tillie?

1:25:57.551 --> 1:26:00.187
Oh, she died.
Yeah, couple of days ago.

1:26:00.220 --> 1:26:01.789
Yeah, yeah.

1:26:01.821 --> 1:26:04.792
- The house is very quiet now.
- I imagine.

1:26:04.824 --> 1:26:06.726
When you got her,
she was so cute.

1:26:06.760 --> 1:26:08.596
- Do you remember?
- I do, yeah.

1:26:08.628 --> 1:26:10.597
I'll join you one day, yeah?

1:26:10.631 --> 1:26:12.833
You better do.
Don't be on your own, alright?

1:26:12.865 --> 1:26:15.435
- Oh, she was such a lovely dog.
- She was, I know.

1:26:15.468 --> 1:26:17.738
- Thank you, Mon.
- Aw.

1:26:17.770 --> 1:26:19.573
See you. 'Bye.

1:27:32.111 --> 1:27:34.748
<i>Thank you for being there
in those final moments.</i>

1:27:34.780 --> 1:27:38.019
<i>She went peacefully,
because of you.</i>

1:27:39.352 --> 1:27:41.989
<i>She was never happy
in the new flat.</i>

1:27:42.021 --> 1:27:44.425
<i>It's no place to keep a dog.</i>

1:27:45.659 --> 1:27:48.762
<i>It's been strange not having to
walk her every day.</i>

1:27:48.794 --> 1:27:50.964
<i>I suppose that makes me
a free man.</i>

1:27:50.998 --> 1:27:53.434
<i>But it doesn't seem that way.</i>

1:27:53.467 --> 1:27:56.470
<i>I hope you're keeping well.</i>

1:27:56.503 --> 1:27:58.939
<i>No need to get back to me.</i>

1:27:58.971 --> 1:28:00.774
<i>I'll understand.</i>

1:28:26.232 --> 1:28:29.035
- Hello, Fern.
- Hello, Dave.

1:28:30.404 --> 1:28:32.272
Hello, Henry.

1:28:32.305 --> 1:28:34.107
Do you want a coffee?

1:28:34.141 --> 1:28:37.745
Um... A cappuccino, please,
decaf.

1:28:39.279 --> 1:28:41.915
Uh, cappuccino, decaf, please.

1:28:46.953 --> 1:28:48.722
I'm so sorry about Tillie.

1:28:48.754 --> 1:28:50.257
She was a grand dog.

1:28:50.289 --> 1:28:51.824
Soft, like you.

1:28:51.857 --> 1:28:55.462
I used to have an edge.
Seems like it got worn down.

1:28:56.829 --> 1:28:58.231
How's utopia?

1:28:58.265 --> 1:29:00.734
I'm getting used to it.

1:29:00.766 --> 1:29:03.569
I've started a campaign
for all us lost souls.

1:29:03.602 --> 1:29:06.105
Get a sprinkler system fitted.

1:29:06.138 --> 1:29:07.807
And the children?

1:29:07.841 --> 1:29:09.443
Yeah, good.

1:29:09.476 --> 1:29:12.079
Getting bigger.
Want to be with their friends.

1:29:13.113 --> 1:29:14.882
- Oh, thank you.
- Thanks.

1:29:14.914 --> 1:29:16.984
Your wife well?

1:29:17.016 --> 1:29:18.751
She was ill.

1:29:18.784 --> 1:29:22.189
It was touch and go.
But she's alright now.

1:29:22.221 --> 1:29:23.990
You didn't tell me.

1:29:25.124 --> 1:29:26.827
I wanted to.

1:29:26.860 --> 1:29:29.163
I came out to find you
on the fields,

1:29:29.195 --> 1:29:30.930
but you were with someone,
a man,

1:29:30.963 --> 1:29:32.399
so I didn't want to intrude.

1:29:32.431 --> 1:29:35.034
So you just walked off
without saying anything?

1:29:35.068 --> 1:29:37.404
I didn't want to mess up
your life.

1:29:37.436 --> 1:29:39.172
I've messed you up enough.

1:29:39.205 --> 1:29:41.441
Oh, so bloody high-minded.

1:29:41.475 --> 1:29:44.011
More interested in doing
the right thing than in me.

1:29:44.043 --> 1:29:46.379
- You could have checked it out.
- Check what out?

1:29:46.413 --> 1:29:48.515
This man that you saw,

1:29:48.547 --> 1:29:52.118
that was my brother
come to tell me he has cancer.

1:29:52.151 --> 1:29:55.021
Sorry. Your poor brother.
Poor you.

1:29:55.055 --> 1:29:58.292
Don't make a meal of it.
He's going to be OK, they think.

1:29:58.324 --> 1:30:01.694
The problem is not my brother.
The problem is you.

1:30:01.727 --> 1:30:04.864
Your daughter
that thinks you're selfish,

1:30:04.897 --> 1:30:06.400
she has no idea.

1:30:06.432 --> 1:30:08.534
You're way behind on selfish.

1:30:08.568 --> 1:30:11.939
You could be 10 times as active
in your own self-interest

1:30:11.971 --> 1:30:13.506
and still be within the norm.

1:30:13.539 --> 1:30:16.609
What you do is endure -

1:30:16.642 --> 1:30:18.578
you endure your homelessness,

1:30:18.611 --> 1:30:21.147
you endure
your daughter's bossiness,

1:30:21.181 --> 1:30:22.683
you endure my comings
and goings.

1:30:22.716 --> 1:30:25.552
You endure for Britain!
It's bats.

1:30:25.584 --> 1:30:28.821
Oh, well,
except that phone call.

1:30:28.855 --> 1:30:31.158
That was something else,
I'll give you that.

1:30:31.190 --> 1:30:33.260
- I'm...
- Don't apologise.

1:30:33.293 --> 1:30:35.062
I had it coming.

1:30:40.566 --> 1:30:43.002
Oh, come on, you great lunk.

1:30:43.035 --> 1:30:45.138
Let's go for a walk.

1:30:45.172 --> 1:30:47.274
There's something
I want to show you.

1:30:47.306 --> 1:30:48.541
What?

1:31:12.833 --> 1:31:15.669
There's something
I've been keeping from you.

1:31:17.971 --> 1:31:19.874
What is it?

1:31:21.240 --> 1:31:23.944
The picture you saw
in my living room,

1:31:23.976 --> 1:31:27.213
it wasn't the daughter
that just got married.

1:31:27.247 --> 1:31:29.016
Oh.

1:31:31.016 --> 1:31:33.287
It was the daughter that died.

1:31:34.520 --> 1:31:36.155
Ouch.

1:31:36.189 --> 1:31:38.057
Um, meningitis.

1:31:38.091 --> 1:31:40.894
She was... 18.

1:31:40.927 --> 1:31:42.429
They diagnosed her early,

1:31:42.462 --> 1:31:45.232
so they hoped they could
save her, but..

1:31:45.265 --> 1:31:47.100
That's bad.

1:31:47.132 --> 1:31:48.702
That's as bad as it gets.

1:31:48.735 --> 1:31:52.105
That's why my son
got so messed up.

1:31:52.137 --> 1:31:55.341
Well, we all did,
in our different ways.

1:31:56.443 --> 1:31:58.512
Your husband?

1:31:58.544 --> 1:32:02.515
Work. Threw himself into work.

1:32:02.548 --> 1:32:06.185
I tried to talk to him,
but he wouldn't listen.

1:32:06.218 --> 1:32:08.055
Didn't want me near him.

1:32:08.087 --> 1:32:10.056
Worked himself into the grave.

1:32:11.557 --> 1:32:14.528
- Wasn't fair on the other two.
- No.

1:32:14.561 --> 1:32:17.331
And the way he looked at me
sometimes,

1:32:17.364 --> 1:32:19.566
like it was my fault.

1:32:19.598 --> 1:32:22.302
To the end, he blamed me.

1:32:23.369 --> 1:32:25.571
Thanks for telling us.

1:32:25.605 --> 1:32:27.641
No wonder.

1:32:27.673 --> 1:32:29.443
What?

1:32:29.476 --> 1:32:31.545
No wonder you lose faith.

1:32:32.678 --> 1:32:35.047
Oh, people with
healthy children, healthy kids,

1:32:35.080 --> 1:32:37.284
I just want to
blow their brains out.

1:32:37.316 --> 1:32:39.386
I get that.

1:32:40.720 --> 1:32:43.891
And... and Jimmy,
he didn't like my moods.

1:32:43.923 --> 1:32:46.894
He told me to get over her,
be glad I had him.

1:32:49.029 --> 1:32:51.298
It's no good denying grief.

1:32:52.531 --> 1:32:55.101
You push it down,
it pops up somewhere else.

1:32:55.135 --> 1:32:56.904
And it can last a long time.

1:32:58.038 --> 1:32:59.940
Forever if it's your kid.

1:32:59.972 --> 1:33:03.644
It's best invited in.
Make a friend of it.

1:33:06.245 --> 1:33:07.980
That's another 80 quid.

1:33:24.396 --> 1:33:26.300
What do you think?

1:33:26.333 --> 1:33:28.402
Nice. Pretty.

1:33:32.571 --> 1:33:35.976
It's you buying it?
It's gonna be yours?

1:33:36.008 --> 1:33:37.977
Yes.

1:33:38.011 --> 1:33:40.113
It's perfect!

1:33:40.145 --> 1:33:42.014
If you need any help moving...

1:34:19.084 --> 1:34:21.788
- That was more like it!
- Yes!

1:34:30.296 --> 1:34:32.265
I'm out of practice.

1:34:32.297 --> 1:34:34.200
Me too!

1:34:36.302 --> 1:34:38.872
I've been anticipating it
for so long.

1:34:38.904 --> 1:34:40.907
It just all came in a rush.

1:34:42.107 --> 1:34:44.711
It was lovely, really.

1:34:44.744 --> 1:34:46.613
Give it time.

1:34:50.449 --> 1:34:53.819
I'm in a sudden dream.
Don't wake me up.

1:34:58.624 --> 1:35:00.593
I'm happy.

1:35:02.962 --> 1:35:04.897
There's a word for it.

1:35:04.931 --> 1:35:07.668
Contento.

1:35:08.501 --> 1:35:11.771
I haven't felt happy
since Sarah died.

1:35:11.805 --> 1:35:13.740
I haven't wanted to.

1:35:15.641 --> 1:35:19.612
Haven't thought
I was entitled to.

1:35:21.114 --> 1:35:23.283
Haven't sung a note since...

1:35:23.315 --> 1:35:25.418
..until...

1:35:30.656 --> 1:35:34.293
Here. She'd want you
to be happy.

1:35:37.529 --> 1:35:40.733
That's what I keep
saying to myself!

1:35:51.677 --> 1:35:53.779
You're liable
to get a lot of this.

1:35:59.218 --> 1:36:00.921
Of course.

1:36:00.954 --> 1:36:02.856
You'll get some too.

1:36:06.258 --> 1:36:08.160
Oh!

1:36:08.194 --> 1:36:11.397
It's walk time.

1:36:12.899 --> 1:36:14.802
Bloody dogs.

1:36:15.869 --> 1:36:18.372
We can come back after.

1:36:19.638 --> 1:36:21.708
I've got to go and feed
the budgies.

1:36:22.574 --> 1:36:24.743
You didn't get budgies?

1:36:24.776 --> 1:36:26.779
Haven't I?

1:36:27.680 --> 1:36:30.016
Then what's that
floating inside us?

1:36:40.059 --> 1:36:41.829
Come on.

1:36:54.274 --> 1:36:56.642
- Come on.
- It wasn't all bad.

1:36:56.676 --> 1:36:58.678
There was a time
before she got really ill,

1:36:58.711 --> 1:37:01.847
she was forgetful but she was
still pretty much herself.

1:37:01.881 --> 1:37:04.251
Then when I started
watching over her,

1:37:04.284 --> 1:37:06.286
we became close,

1:37:06.319 --> 1:37:08.788
closer than we'd been
for a long time.

1:37:08.820 --> 1:37:10.823
Forever, maybe.

1:37:10.856 --> 1:37:13.560
I guess underneath it all

1:37:13.592 --> 1:37:15.695
we both knew
the end was coming...

1:37:17.129 --> 1:37:19.031
..and we were saying goodbye.

1:37:20.499 --> 1:37:23.203
Maybe I should meet her again.
