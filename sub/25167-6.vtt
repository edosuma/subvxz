WEBVTT

00:03.718 --> 00:06.671
He was stabbed last
night outside his house.

00:06.683 --> 00:08.675
We were together, Mand...

00:08.732 --> 00:10.643
It's just so sexy, innit?

00:10.666 --> 00:12.755
Razia Paracha!

00:12.767 --> 00:14.253
I tried kissing Cory.

00:14.299 --> 00:16.458
- What happened?
- He broke Riz's neck.

00:16.492 --> 00:18.702
- I feel awful.
- So you should.

00:18.714 --> 00:20.073
I have come up with an idea...

00:20.113 --> 00:21.875
A proper production...

00:21.898 --> 00:23.291
Do you have to jump on the first guy

00:23.308 --> 00:25.369
- that shows you any sort of attention?
- Yeah, she does...

00:25.405 --> 00:27.942
Everyone at that new school
thinks they are way better than me.

00:27.966 --> 00:29.416
I am just scum.

00:34.911 --> 00:38.033
Well, go on, then. Don't
just stand there gawping.

00:38.912 --> 00:40.842
I don't know about this, love.

00:40.967 --> 00:43.218
You've just got to go in there
and take whatever they got.

00:44.185 --> 00:45.764
OK? Go on!

00:50.880 --> 00:52.461
You sure this is a good idea?

00:52.664 --> 00:54.129
What choice have we got?

00:54.428 --> 00:56.220
It's either this or starve.

01:00.120 --> 01:02.830
So you say you have experience
in buying and selling?

01:02.880 --> 01:05.754
Pharmaceuticals, mostly.

01:07.252 --> 01:09.467
And was that office-based?

01:10.280 --> 01:11.807
Mainly on move.

01:12.525 --> 01:15.990
Well, I think we can definitely
offer you something in our shop.

01:16.115 --> 01:18.656
- _
- So if you can just fill this out for me... ?

01:26.480 --> 01:28.323
So how did you manage to
sort an interview anyway?

01:28.332 --> 01:29.714
Tracey who does my roots.

01:29.723 --> 01:32.532
Her sister's cousin has got a mate
who works in the knicker department.

01:32.657 --> 01:33.881
Who?

01:34.162 --> 01:35.628
Run!

01:40.445 --> 01:42.080
Go left! Go left!

01:52.986 --> 01:54.585
Welcome to my world.

01:59.040 --> 02:00.503
What?

02:01.701 --> 02:03.009
I love you, Missy Booth.

02:22.452 --> 02:27.452

_

02:37.361 --> 02:40.184
_

02:41.418 --> 02:45.052
- Just talk to him.
- What's the point? He hates me.

02:45.645 --> 02:47.195
Naveed, he...

02:47.893 --> 02:49.229
Nass...

02:49.252 --> 02:50.875
Oh, Missy, please stay away from me.

02:50.891 --> 02:53.839
All I was trying to do was stop
your mum from doing owt stupid.

02:53.880 --> 02:55.715
I never meant to hurt you, I swear.

02:55.741 --> 02:58.727
OK, I just really want to
forget that it ever happened, OK?

03:04.640 --> 03:06.403
Does that mean we can talk about me now?

03:06.875 --> 03:08.220
Why? What's happened?

03:09.464 --> 03:10.660
It's Aaron.

03:10.922 --> 03:12.336
What's he done?

03:13.677 --> 03:15.660
He said he loved me, didn't he?

03:16.822 --> 03:17.987
Oh.

03:18.070 --> 03:20.131
Oh, my God!

03:21.755 --> 03:25.071
- Missy, that's amazing!
- No, it's not.

03:25.140 --> 03:27.301
We were getting on great,
then he goes and ruins it.

03:28.624 --> 03:31.083
I'm collecting money to
send Riz to Disneyland.

03:31.253 --> 03:32.537
Why?

03:32.716 --> 03:34.813
So he can swim with
the dolphins and that.

03:34.861 --> 03:36.473
He's not dying, Raz.

03:36.529 --> 03:39.004
- How do you know? Have you seen him?
- No.

03:39.329 --> 03:40.373
Good.

03:40.558 --> 03:43.056
Cos as soon as he's
better, I'm asking him out.

03:50.560 --> 03:51.995
Are we planting this tree or what?

03:56.520 --> 03:57.826
Where's the tree?

03:58.102 --> 03:59.295
Someone's stolen it.

04:07.709 --> 04:10.333
Um, right, listen up, everyone. Listen,

04:10.612 --> 04:13.800
I'm afraid we're going to have
to postpone the tree-planting.

04:13.960 --> 04:15.559
Aw!

04:15.560 --> 04:17.966
So we've been standing out
in the cold for nothing, then?

04:17.997 --> 04:20.243
It's a lot warmer in
isolation, believe me.

04:22.640 --> 04:24.462
Can I just have one
day without any trouble?

04:24.480 --> 04:25.516
Is that too much to ask?

04:25.537 --> 04:27.102
I've got the police on the phone.

04:30.500 --> 04:32.893
I pray thee, gentle mortal, sing again.

04:32.928 --> 04:35.326
Mine ear is much enamoured of thy note.

04:38.086 --> 04:39.400
This isn't working.

04:39.525 --> 04:40.933
What's wrong with it?

04:41.058 --> 04:43.235
Well, you're lacking focus for a start.

04:43.256 --> 04:45.501
Titania's meant to be
in love with Bottom.

04:45.626 --> 04:47.275
Give it some passion.

04:47.304 --> 04:49.563
Yeah, we can work on
that. Can't we, Missy?

04:49.880 --> 04:51.685
It's not our fault the
stupid play don't make sense.

04:51.707 --> 04:53.882
- I mean, what's it even about, anyway?
- Drugs, miss.

04:54.007 --> 04:55.533
Oberon was a dealer in it.

04:55.856 --> 04:58.305
It's about love, Amin.

04:59.082 --> 05:01.410
And how it brings out the
best and the worst in us.

05:02.165 --> 05:03.327
As Lysander says,

05:03.345 --> 05:05.956
"The course of true love
never did run smooth."

05:06.949 --> 05:09.049
Go from the top, please!

05:10.269 --> 05:12.938
Just, um, go easy on us, yeah?

05:13.388 --> 05:15.602
I'm practically a
virgin compared to you.

05:34.555 --> 05:36.664
- How're you feeling?
- Tired.

05:36.789 --> 05:38.668
There's no need for any of this.

05:38.669 --> 05:40.726
That school has a lot to answer for.

05:45.949 --> 05:47.664
You're lucky you're walking at all.

05:48.429 --> 05:50.350
What matters is that he's home.

05:51.040 --> 05:52.998
All I want to do is sleep.

05:53.429 --> 05:55.486
I am going to be right
here with you, OK?

05:55.512 --> 05:56.927
I'll make sure you get some lunch.

05:56.966 --> 05:58.581
I'll be all right, I swear.

05:58.869 --> 06:01.193
The hospital said
he'll be able to manage.

06:01.245 --> 06:03.303
Why don't you just call us if
you need anything, all right?

06:03.338 --> 06:04.379
Yeah.

06:04.749 --> 06:05.766
So, come on,

06:06.957 --> 06:09.109
- let's get you to school.
- All right.

06:13.642 --> 06:15.678
Come on. Come on. He'll be fine.

06:18.139 --> 06:21.076
Hey, nothing too strenuous, all right?

06:49.298 --> 06:51.639
Everyone at school's
talking about you, you know?

06:52.226 --> 06:53.271
Yeah?

06:54.210 --> 06:55.488
What did you say?

06:56.146 --> 06:58.277
Don't worry. I never said owt about us.

07:00.789 --> 07:02.738
It must have been dead scary.

07:05.589 --> 07:08.042
I just kept thinking about all
the stuff I haven't done yet.

07:09.171 --> 07:10.869
Yeah. Like what?

07:19.968 --> 07:22.728
_

07:24.489 --> 07:27.671
_

07:55.508 --> 07:58.533
- Sorry I'm late, sir.
- You all right, Hayley? You seem out of breath.

07:58.589 --> 08:00.081
That's cos I ran here.

08:00.789 --> 08:04.609
Deoxyribonucleic acid is
more commonly known as...

08:04.734 --> 08:05.734
Clint?

08:05.768 --> 08:07.819
Hayley Booth having it
off with Riz Nawaz, sir.

08:07.847 --> 08:09.852
He's funny.

08:10.629 --> 08:12.046
What's he talking about?

08:12.461 --> 08:13.520
Just ignore him.

08:13.551 --> 08:16.206
I'll give you a clue, Clint.
The answer's on the board.

08:16.699 --> 08:18.525
DNA, sir!

08:18.551 --> 08:19.695
Two rub-downs a day.

08:19.716 --> 08:21.787
Isn't that what the
doctor ordered... Hayley?

08:21.949 --> 08:23.520
You and Riz?

08:23.690 --> 08:25.048
They're lying.

08:25.429 --> 08:27.201
Let's start with the basics, shall we?

08:27.778 --> 08:28.839
Tahira.

08:28.839 --> 08:31.508
How are the two strands
of DNA held together?

08:31.509 --> 08:33.687
I don't know, it just
looks like a funny shape.

08:33.707 --> 08:36.215
- That's what Hayley said to Riz.
- I'm going to kill him!

08:36.227 --> 08:39.089
Missy. Sit down... Sit down!

08:39.996 --> 08:41.833
Another word out of you lads,

08:41.851 --> 08:45.616
- and it's straight to isolation. Yes?
- It's not us, it's Riz sending the messages.

08:46.589 --> 08:48.584
It's not, it's not true, is it?

08:48.869 --> 08:50.165
Course it's not.

08:56.429 --> 08:58.441
- I want a word with you.
- Missy. Leave it.

08:58.458 --> 09:00.424
If Riz says owt else about my sister,

09:00.441 --> 09:02.262
it won't just be his neck
he has to worry about.

09:02.269 --> 09:03.428
You tell her, Missy.

09:03.429 --> 09:05.004
You can shut your face an' all.

09:05.043 --> 09:06.545
Make you feel like the big man, does it?

09:06.549 --> 09:08.868
- Talking trash about my sister.
- Missy, what's happened?

09:08.869 --> 09:10.944
Riz has been shooting his
mouth off about our Hayley.

09:10.990 --> 09:14.476
Riz and Hayley? As if he'd
go anywhere near that skank.

09:16.266 --> 09:18.476
You think you're so much
better than us, don't you?

09:18.507 --> 09:20.677
With your flash house
and your sparkly hijabs.

09:20.695 --> 09:22.467
- Get off me!
- Leave it, Missy!

09:22.476 --> 09:25.563
No, Hayley. Riz needs to learn
to keep his dirty mouth shut.

09:25.589 --> 09:27.291
He's telling the truth.

09:27.606 --> 09:29.156
What did you just say?

09:29.650 --> 09:30.982
I'm sorry.

09:31.017 --> 09:33.039
You devious little cow!

09:34.389 --> 09:35.900
Hayley...

09:36.061 --> 09:37.358
Wait...

09:38.184 --> 09:39.533
You and Riz!?

09:41.869 --> 09:43.668
All that stuff that he said.

09:43.922 --> 09:45.281
I did it.

09:46.958 --> 09:49.303
I thought he liked me, Missy.

09:50.669 --> 09:52.905
Come here.

09:53.948 --> 09:55.542
Don't worry.

09:59.069 --> 10:00.294
I'm going to sort this.

10:00.691 --> 10:02.691
Those Year Eight toe rags have only gone

10:02.708 --> 10:04.188
and set fire to Mr Qureshi's tree!

10:04.267 --> 10:06.560
- Why would they do that?
- Cos they're psychopaths.

10:06.630 --> 10:08.534
Mr Bell's putting the
screws on them now.

10:08.599 --> 10:09.788
What do you want me to do with it?

10:09.789 --> 10:12.490
Just leave it here. I'll
try and sneak it out tonight.

10:14.509 --> 10:15.926
You wanted to see me?

10:16.149 --> 10:17.476
Yeah.

10:19.309 --> 10:20.890
Is that Sami's tree?

10:21.549 --> 10:24.022
It was just a prank that backfired.

10:24.043 --> 10:26.484
But don't worry. Steve is
dealing with it, right now.

10:26.509 --> 10:28.572
Will you get us some coffees? Thanks.

10:29.211 --> 10:30.486
Have a seat.

10:36.654 --> 10:37.961
The police called.

10:39.271 --> 10:40.664
Have they arrested Khadim?

10:40.672 --> 10:42.865
They've said that he
is a person of interest,

10:42.876 --> 10:45.149
but as yet, they've
failed to locate him.

10:47.221 --> 10:48.224
Why?

10:49.075 --> 10:50.267
I don't know...

10:51.967 --> 10:53.333
But without any further leads,

10:53.351 --> 10:55.740
there's not much more the police can do.

10:58.604 --> 10:59.799
I'm so sorry, Emma.

10:59.817 --> 11:01.407
I'm sorry it's not better news.

11:03.740 --> 11:07.873
Sami's dead, and he
just gets away with it?

11:09.100 --> 11:11.263
They did say that they've
tried everything in their power

11:11.269 --> 11:12.519
to try and find him.

11:14.241 --> 11:15.402
Of course they have.

11:35.709 --> 11:38.135
It's like something out of a Bond movie.

11:42.010 --> 11:43.348
Where're you going?

11:43.349 --> 11:44.744
To have it out with Riz.

11:44.817 --> 11:46.123
They've got a triple garage.

11:46.149 --> 11:48.223
You think they give a
monkeys about our Hayley?

11:48.509 --> 11:50.219
All right, well, what
are you going to do?

11:52.429 --> 11:54.429
Hit him where it really hurts.

12:47.231 --> 12:50.064
Hi. I wonder if you can help me...

12:50.189 --> 12:52.921
A man was stabbed on this
street. Sami Qureshi...

12:53.100 --> 12:55.819
No. No. Sorry, love. Sorry.

12:56.189 --> 12:59.904
Hi. I'm looking for the
family of Khadim Afzal.

12:59.993 --> 13:01.184
Sorry, I don't know him.

13:01.221 --> 13:03.587
Do you know anything about
the stabbing that happened?

13:18.031 --> 13:19.548
Excuse me.

13:19.549 --> 13:20.744
Um...

13:20.782 --> 13:23.035
My friend, Sami, was
killed on this street.

13:23.580 --> 13:26.228
Did you know anything,
did you see anything?

13:26.458 --> 13:28.538
It was only recently
up there by the park.

13:31.589 --> 13:33.852
Please, Moeen? Somebody
must know something!

13:33.900 --> 13:36.084
You have no right coming here
upsetting my neighbours...

13:36.115 --> 13:38.844
Well... I'm just trying to
find out where Khadim is.

13:38.870 --> 13:40.241
He's in Pakistan.

13:40.328 --> 13:42.544
Now, will you just leave it, please?

13:42.608 --> 13:44.512
Well, do you know
where his family lives?

13:44.869 --> 13:46.388
You do, don't you?

13:46.389 --> 13:48.080
The police are doing what they can,

13:48.205 --> 13:49.892
nobody needs you interfering.

13:51.124 --> 13:53.548
Fine, well, if you won't help me,

13:53.549 --> 13:56.001
then I'll just keep trying
until somebody else does.

13:58.709 --> 14:00.434
This is not all about you.

14:07.185 --> 14:09.564
I lost my son, Miss Keane.

14:11.533 --> 14:14.296
I found him lying dead on this street.

14:15.466 --> 14:18.308
You think I don't want justice too?

14:18.309 --> 14:19.729
He was my friend.

14:22.279 --> 14:25.346
We both know he was more than that.

14:31.975 --> 14:34.110
Is that what this is all about?

14:34.431 --> 14:36.792
You trying to make yourself feel better?

14:40.011 --> 14:42.775
Maryam lost her husband.

14:43.138 --> 14:45.478
My wife lost her son...

14:45.648 --> 14:47.845
Out of respect for them...

14:48.142 --> 14:51.242
... will you please
just leave us alone?!

15:06.883 --> 15:08.341
Come on.

15:15.193 --> 15:16.420
Excuse me.

15:18.132 --> 15:19.372
Shift!

15:22.441 --> 15:24.459
Get in here. Now!

15:25.009 --> 15:26.680
I want to report a sexual assault.

15:26.763 --> 15:29.566
Riz Nawaz. He's only gone and
made Hayley do things to him.

15:29.880 --> 15:32.104
- Uh... Did he force you, Hayley?
- No!

15:32.169 --> 15:33.959
He's 17, she's 15.

15:33.968 --> 15:35.693
That makes him a paedophile, don't it?

15:35.711 --> 15:38.383
Well, let's not go throwing
words like that around, shall we?

15:38.508 --> 15:40.820
So are you going to do
something about it or not?

15:42.449 --> 15:43.685
Well...

15:50.637 --> 15:52.694
... as you know I am obliged to report

15:52.711 --> 15:55.130
all safeguarding issues to the police.

15:55.610 --> 15:57.004
The police?

15:57.025 --> 15:58.808
Well, yeah, Hayley is still a child.

15:58.809 --> 16:00.353
And Riz did get her to...

16:00.741 --> 16:03.326
perform... a sex act on him.

16:04.064 --> 16:05.605
This is ridiculous.

16:05.793 --> 16:09.124
So will he have a criminal record?

16:09.190 --> 16:12.518
By all accounts, Hayley
consented, so it's unlikely

16:12.531 --> 16:14.418
that the police will take
things further in this instance.

16:14.458 --> 16:15.776
So he just gets away with it?

16:15.838 --> 16:18.637
- It takes two to tango, Missy.
- Whose side are you on?

16:18.676 --> 16:20.047
Your mother's right.

16:20.296 --> 16:23.086
Chances are your sister
offered it up to him on a plate.

16:23.148 --> 16:26.450
- Do you want a smack?!
- Shall we just keep calm. Yeah?

16:26.633 --> 16:27.848
Riz is a good lad.

16:27.849 --> 16:30.061
- Well, you would say that, wouldn't you?!
- Thank you Missy.

16:30.069 --> 16:33.397
Let's just... Let's just stick
to the subject in hand, shall we?

16:33.432 --> 16:35.747
I think what's important
here today is that we all,

16:35.768 --> 16:38.887
we all decide what's best
to do to move forward.

16:38.900 --> 16:42.063
- He should be kicked out.
- Well, that's not going to happen.

16:42.117 --> 16:44.497
I could ground our Hayley, if you like.

16:44.546 --> 16:46.848
There you go again,
sticking up for them!

16:46.849 --> 16:48.349
Just cos they live in some posh house

16:48.369 --> 16:49.436
don't mean they're better than us.

16:49.457 --> 16:51.503
Right, I think what we can agree on

16:51.520 --> 16:55.236
is that Hayley and Riz should
be kept apart at all costs. Yeah?

16:55.703 --> 16:57.957
Don't worry. I'll make sure of it.

16:57.969 --> 17:00.036
Great. And while you're there,
maybe you could talk to him

17:00.049 --> 17:02.604
- about objectifying women?
- Now, just hang on a minute...

17:02.625 --> 17:04.152
Whatever went on between him and Hayley,

17:04.165 --> 17:06.863
it doesn't give him the right to
go boasting about it on WhatsApp.

17:06.874 --> 17:08.502
Right, are we done here?

17:09.085 --> 17:10.135
Missy?

17:15.012 --> 17:16.078
Come on.

17:27.334 --> 17:28.728
What did you say to 'em?

17:28.729 --> 17:31.135
That he needs to keep his
dirty hands to himself.

17:31.529 --> 17:34.364
I told you before, lads round
here are a waste of time.

17:34.489 --> 17:35.747
Not all of 'em.

17:36.569 --> 17:38.908
So from now on, you stay
away from him. Do you hear me?

17:46.209 --> 17:47.271
You should count yourself lucky

17:47.289 --> 17:49.095
you're not on the sex
offenders register.

17:49.116 --> 17:50.524
She's 15!

17:51.023 --> 17:52.094
I'm sorry.

17:53.227 --> 17:54.785
What were you thinking of, eh?

17:54.969 --> 17:57.205
It's bad enough you're messing
around with her in the first place...

17:57.226 --> 17:59.511
then you have to go broadcast
it round the whole school!

17:59.521 --> 18:00.695
I told Cory.

18:01.044 --> 18:03.179
I wasn't to know he'd
open his big mouth, was I?

18:03.463 --> 18:05.192
What did you have to
tell him for, anyway?

18:06.921 --> 18:09.171
Because everybody's always
talking about stuff...

18:09.635 --> 18:10.837
- ... and I... just...
- What?

18:11.099 --> 18:12.749
You felt you had to compete?

18:22.310 --> 18:23.373
Look, son,

18:23.415 --> 18:25.031
no girl is ever going to respect you

18:25.049 --> 18:28.267
if you go behind her back
and show off to your mates.

18:28.973 --> 18:30.779
I've messed everything up, haven't I?

18:40.413 --> 18:42.610
It's nothing an apology won't sort.

18:48.129 --> 18:49.286
Hey, whoa, what you doing?

18:49.289 --> 18:50.491
We're supposed to be going
to the cinema, remember?

18:50.512 --> 18:52.762
Oh, yeah, I'm staying in with Hayley.

18:53.609 --> 18:54.641
She's a big girl, Missy...

18:54.652 --> 18:56.241
I'm sure she can look after
herself for a few hours.

18:56.262 --> 18:58.725
Well, that's where you're wrong,
cos if I'd done a better job

18:58.746 --> 19:00.862
looking after her, she
wouldn't be in this mess.

19:00.887 --> 19:03.112
Shut up, Missy, you have
got to stop blaming yourself.

19:03.147 --> 19:04.688
That's easy for you to say.

19:04.689 --> 19:07.217
You've got a family, you've
got people who care about you.

19:07.224 --> 19:09.237
The only person Hayley's got is me.

19:10.037 --> 19:11.041
I don't understand why you're making

19:11.045 --> 19:12.802
such a big deal of this, to be honest.

19:12.837 --> 19:15.097
I mean, all Riz was doing
was showing off to his mates.

19:15.132 --> 19:16.812
So you're sticking up for him now?!

19:17.056 --> 19:19.505
No, but it's not like he
took advantage of her, is it?

19:19.546 --> 19:21.342
Hayley knew exactly what she were doing.

19:21.650 --> 19:23.955
- Just get out of here!
- Hey, whoa, what have I done now?!

19:23.969 --> 19:25.796
You're just as bad as he is!

19:25.848 --> 19:27.623
Right, so I'm not
allowed an opinion, am I?

19:27.672 --> 19:28.839
I'm supposed to be your boyfriend.

19:28.867 --> 19:30.540
That's where you're wrong, in't it?

19:30.774 --> 19:32.000
Eh? What you talking about?

19:32.056 --> 19:34.096
I don't want to be with you, all right?!

19:34.250 --> 19:36.918
So why don't you do us
both a favour? Clear off!

19:49.702 --> 19:51.100
Missy!

19:51.994 --> 19:53.105
Missy!

19:54.509 --> 19:56.713
- Missy!
- Ugh...

20:00.958 --> 20:02.277
What're you doing?

20:02.303 --> 20:05.793
Look, what I said yesterday
about Riz and Hayley, look...

20:06.033 --> 20:07.604
... you've got it all wrong.

20:07.622 --> 20:09.430
You should've thought
about that before you opened

20:09.456 --> 20:11.115
your big mouth, then, shouldn't you?!

20:18.059 --> 20:19.322
Missy!

20:19.566 --> 20:21.749
Missy! Why're you being such a cow?

20:22.112 --> 20:23.806
Look, I'm here because I like you.

20:23.823 --> 20:25.408
Why is that so hard
for you to understand?

20:25.443 --> 20:28.155
- You don't even know me.
- I know enough.

20:29.386 --> 20:32.084
All right, if you know me so
well, what's my favourite film?

20:32.119 --> 20:34.488
- Easy: Step Up.
- Wrong.

20:34.929 --> 20:36.404
Well, ask me another, then.

20:36.444 --> 20:38.094
What's my favourite day of the year?

20:38.448 --> 20:40.112
How am I... ?! I don't
know... Christmas?!

20:40.143 --> 20:41.470
Wrong again!

20:48.003 --> 20:49.724
It's the fireworks for Eid.

20:49.895 --> 20:52.536
Your nana used to take you and
Hayley to watch them on the hill.

20:52.781 --> 20:55.689
- Why are you being like this?
- Just keep walking.

20:59.287 --> 21:00.793
Mum?

21:03.007 --> 21:04.610
You're going to be late for school.

21:07.479 --> 21:09.165
I'm not going in today.

21:23.371 --> 21:26.226
So, I want to start by saying
thank you for giving up your break.

21:26.289 --> 21:28.785
Sir, this better be worth it, man.

21:29.025 --> 21:31.251
It's come to our attention
that there's a message stream

21:31.291 --> 21:33.823
going round about certain
girls at this school.

21:33.849 --> 21:36.422
You want to join the chat, sir?

21:36.547 --> 21:37.901
You think it's funny?

21:38.616 --> 21:40.894
Ridiculing and degrading girls?

21:40.942 --> 21:42.528
It's just banter, sir.

21:42.529 --> 21:44.885
And what if it was your
sister they were talking about?

21:45.010 --> 21:46.440
I'd kill 'em, sir.

21:46.565 --> 21:48.986
Thank you. I wouldn't
endorse violence...

21:49.195 --> 21:51.324
Not much point you being here, is there?

21:51.353 --> 21:54.916
So, while you lot are bigging up
your sexual exploits on WhatsApp,

21:55.041 --> 21:58.763
the girls are actually knuckling
down and getting on with their work.

21:59.134 --> 22:01.558
- Are we done, sir?
- No, we're not!

22:01.903 --> 22:04.514
Cos whilst it might seem
harmless "banter" to you,

22:04.553 --> 22:06.684
other people are getting hurt by it.

22:06.809 --> 22:09.762
- We're just having a laugh.
- It's harassment!

22:11.509 --> 22:15.713
And it shows you up to be
the little boys that you are.

22:20.499 --> 22:22.765
- Ms Carter...
- Just give me ten minutes.

22:22.769 --> 22:25.633
- I'm trying to track down some years seven truants...
- But, erm...

22:26.638 --> 22:28.729
Miss Keane still isn't here.

22:28.769 --> 22:31.367
Leaving our dress rehearsal
something of a rudderless ship.

22:31.492 --> 22:33.861
Oh. Well, you're the musical director...

22:33.889 --> 22:35.604
can't you... you cover that?

22:35.668 --> 22:37.218
A double stroke roll, I can handle.

22:37.240 --> 22:38.795
Actors on the other hand...

22:39.642 --> 22:41.323
What do you want me to do?

22:45.100 --> 22:46.449
Oh...

22:50.466 --> 22:52.623
So, have you actually spoken to Aaron?

22:53.257 --> 22:54.720
No, Nas.

22:55.226 --> 22:58.017
It's over. Blokes are a waste of time.

22:58.392 --> 23:00.576
I just hope our Hayley's
learnt her lesson.

23:01.750 --> 23:03.808
Everyone might as well go.

23:03.891 --> 23:05.367
What're you talking about?

23:05.393 --> 23:06.729
Erm...

23:06.854 --> 23:09.655
My mum's quit the play so
there isn't going to be a show.

23:10.089 --> 23:11.964
Not if I've got anything to do with it.

23:11.991 --> 23:14.776
Right, who's going to
bring me up to speed?

23:16.529 --> 23:17.881
Anyone?

23:18.769 --> 23:22.207
- It's a dress rehearsal, Miss.
- Yeah, I can see that, Hayley.

23:22.249 --> 23:24.467
What I mean is, do you
all know what you're doing?

23:26.789 --> 23:28.168
I've got my work cut out here.

23:28.169 --> 23:30.425
It's not our fault, Miss,
Shakespeare's dead boring.

23:30.449 --> 23:31.847
Aw, well, it's just as well he's got you

23:31.864 --> 23:33.810
to bring his words to
life, isn't it, Candice?

23:33.824 --> 23:35.596
Finish with your wigs
and your make-up and stuff

23:35.617 --> 23:37.619
and I'll see you on
stage in ten minutes.

23:37.804 --> 23:40.048
Sorry, Miss Carter.
These came to reception.

23:40.049 --> 23:41.269
- For me?
- No.

23:42.108 --> 23:45.045
Tell your boyfriend to do
his own dirty work in future.

23:46.969 --> 23:48.108
Are they from Riz?

23:48.233 --> 23:49.977
Yeah, Miss. He said he's sorry.

23:50.659 --> 23:53.128
Right. I'll go and check on the boys.

23:58.043 --> 24:00.433
One poxy bunch of flowers.
Is that all it takes?

24:00.468 --> 24:02.298
Well, I love him, so...

24:05.449 --> 24:06.930
After everything he's done?!

24:07.055 --> 24:08.346
He said he's sorry, didn't he?

24:08.349 --> 24:10.759
So what happens when he does
it again? Cos he will, you know!

24:10.769 --> 24:12.368
I'm sick of you telling me what to do.

24:12.369 --> 24:14.000
Just stay out of my business!

24:16.655 --> 24:18.776
Oh, you two deserve each other!

24:20.449 --> 24:21.476
I can't seem to do it.

24:21.511 --> 24:23.977
Well, it's just like a normal
cap isn't it? You just...

24:24.417 --> 24:27.002
- Where are you going?
- Home, Miss.

24:29.468 --> 24:31.421
Yeah, it gets too
tight on me head, Miss.

24:31.829 --> 24:32.932
How big's your head?

24:48.569 --> 24:49.625
Hi.

24:51.951 --> 24:53.230
Come in.

24:55.409 --> 24:57.708
I heard there was trouble
at the Qureshi's yesterday.

25:02.643 --> 25:04.117
All I want is answers,

25:04.242 --> 25:06.182
and no-one's giving me any.

25:06.273 --> 25:07.688
That's why I'm here.

25:08.205 --> 25:09.924
You deserve to know the truth.

25:12.952 --> 25:16.061
Sami summoned me and
the elders to a meeting.

25:17.141 --> 25:19.054
He wanted us to send Khadim packing,

25:19.093 --> 25:22.373
to protect Jordan
Wilson and kids like him.

25:24.601 --> 25:25.670
I know.

25:26.254 --> 25:28.032
Sami told me all this.

25:29.177 --> 25:30.609
I didn't want to get involved,

25:30.734 --> 25:32.884
but we agreed that
Hassan would go round and

25:33.341 --> 25:34.718
speak to the family,

25:35.063 --> 25:37.931
tell Khadim to stop or clear off.

25:39.475 --> 25:41.053
But it got out of hand...

25:42.961 --> 25:44.969
So murdering Sami was...

25:45.253 --> 25:47.908
some sort of... retaliation?

25:48.689 --> 25:50.384
I don't know.

25:54.589 --> 25:56.339
Did you go to the police?

25:56.348 --> 25:57.781
Of course I did.

25:59.060 --> 26:00.571
I told them everything,

26:00.851 --> 26:03.165
but they can't drag
him back from Mirpur.

26:03.384 --> 26:06.501
Well, you must know people
out there. Call them!

26:06.684 --> 26:08.291
OK, but...

26:10.116 --> 26:12.221
... well, that could take years.

26:37.350 --> 26:38.594
A year ago,

26:39.423 --> 26:40.978
I was at Sami's interview.

26:42.849 --> 26:44.769
We were looking for the right people

26:45.110 --> 26:46.887
to help the kids at our school.

26:47.870 --> 26:51.032
Sami didn't put down that he'd
been to prison in his application,

26:51.647 --> 26:54.629
but I knew because my
dad knew his dad, Moeen.

26:55.826 --> 26:59.092
After the interview, I
spoked to Sami about it.

27:00.249 --> 27:01.663
And he felt that

27:02.401 --> 27:04.890
his experiences of
growing up in this town,

27:05.642 --> 27:08.768
of going down the wrong
path but finding his way out,

27:09.249 --> 27:12.458
made him perfect for
working with our young lads.

27:15.113 --> 27:17.361
Sami wouldn't want this.

27:20.118 --> 27:22.655
He'd want you to do what he did

27:23.329 --> 27:25.550
and focus on those kids.

27:29.052 --> 27:32.074
And I've heard A Midsummer
Night's Dream is really good.

27:44.916 --> 27:48.374
I miss him so much.

27:48.435 --> 27:49.797
I know.

27:50.845 --> 27:53.652
And let's make sure that
he's never forgotten, eh?

28:04.671 --> 28:06.019
Yeah.

28:10.306 --> 28:11.639
Here we are.

28:24.490 --> 28:25.913
What do you think, love?

28:25.944 --> 28:27.739
Got 100 more on order.

28:28.219 --> 28:30.188
State of the art, is this.

28:30.358 --> 28:32.699
It's got a retractable
head and everything.

28:32.979 --> 28:34.625
You're unbelievable...

28:34.926 --> 28:36.607
What have I done now?

28:37.127 --> 28:39.571
You're worrying about
some poxy mop, when...

28:39.585 --> 28:41.437
You know Hayley's back
with Riz, don't you?

28:41.562 --> 28:43.074
I thought she might.

28:43.257 --> 28:44.882
What? Is that all you've got to say?

28:45.096 --> 28:48.113
She's young. She's got to
learn from her mistakes.

28:48.170 --> 28:49.790
That's just typical of you, that is.

28:49.846 --> 28:52.244
Why don't you try being a
mum for once in your life?

28:52.689 --> 28:55.082
Because you never let me.

28:55.445 --> 28:57.052
You're suffocating her, Missy.

28:57.087 --> 28:58.676
She needs looking after.

28:58.694 --> 29:00.432
And who's looking out for you, eh?

29:01.016 --> 29:02.733
I can take care of myself.

29:02.976 --> 29:04.545
You know your problem?

29:04.964 --> 29:08.191
You've spent so long worrying
about me and our Hayley...

29:08.656 --> 29:10.886
You never gave yoursen
a chance, did you?

29:11.519 --> 29:12.703
This isn't about me.

29:13.104 --> 29:14.471
Well, it should be.

29:14.550 --> 29:17.397
Cos if anyone deserves to
be happy, it's my Missy.

29:22.350 --> 29:24.253
I am happy.

29:25.079 --> 29:27.030
So why did you dump Aaron?

29:32.336 --> 29:34.307
He said he loved me, didn't he?

29:35.494 --> 29:37.442
And you got scared?

29:40.062 --> 29:41.962
We both know what he's after.

29:42.717 --> 29:44.848
He said it cos he likes you, Missy.

29:45.922 --> 29:48.525
Take it from someone who knows.

29:49.005 --> 29:52.786
Because no bloke I've ever been with
looked at me the way he does you.

29:53.407 --> 29:55.503
- You're just saying that.
- Oh.

29:55.843 --> 29:58.375
I've seen 'em all over years.

29:58.550 --> 30:01.271
The liars, the thieves...

30:01.293 --> 30:02.943
The one who put you in hospital.

30:04.912 --> 30:07.035
But what you've got to remember is,

30:07.712 --> 30:09.908
there are some good ones out there.

30:11.261 --> 30:14.396
And I hate to think of
you missing out cos of me.

30:37.955 --> 30:39.658
Right, before you say anything,

30:39.667 --> 30:41.038
you've got to hear me out, all right?

30:41.055 --> 30:43.325
But if I get all jumbled, it's
cos I'm no good at this stuff.

30:43.342 --> 30:44.775
I'm all ears.

30:47.360 --> 30:49.491
- I know I've been a bit of a bitch...
- A bit?

30:49.505 --> 30:51.646
- Did I say you could speak?
- Sorry. Sorry.

30:52.949 --> 30:54.077
It's just...

30:56.016 --> 30:57.731
... what you said to me the other day...

31:02.314 --> 31:04.488
No-one's ever said
that to me before, yeah?

31:04.757 --> 31:07.468
And I don't know what
you're supposed to do.

31:08.376 --> 31:09.850
You don't have to do anything.

31:10.549 --> 31:13.078
Yeah, but I'm always the
one in control, aren't I?

31:13.120 --> 31:15.715
But now I'm not. And...

31:18.056 --> 31:19.571
I got scared.

31:24.277 --> 31:26.362
I know most people
think I'm some gobby cow,

31:26.376 --> 31:28.926
but that's just for show.

31:32.144 --> 31:33.751
Missy Booth.

31:34.054 --> 31:36.192
She's like my Sasha Fierce, isn't she?

31:38.536 --> 31:41.383
All the lads at school
think I'm just some tease.

31:42.973 --> 31:45.446
Keep 'em hanging, that way...

31:47.410 --> 31:49.285
... they don't have to
know the truth, do they?

31:50.542 --> 31:51.909
The truth about what?

31:55.776 --> 31:57.543
That I've never been with anyone before.

32:00.897 --> 32:02.602
- Does that put you off?
- No.

32:02.661 --> 32:04.467
No. No, course not. Look...

32:06.336 --> 32:08.036
I love you, Missy.

32:10.505 --> 32:12.475
Even though I'm a mental case?

32:15.001 --> 32:16.063
Come here.

32:21.571 --> 32:22.633
What is it?

32:29.582 --> 32:30.646
I'm ready.

32:33.295 --> 32:34.350
Are you sure?

32:52.216 --> 32:53.272
You all right?

32:54.303 --> 32:55.340
Yeah.

32:56.319 --> 32:58.581
- What I said yesterday...
- Forget it.

33:00.699 --> 33:02.691
I can look after myself, you know.

33:02.730 --> 33:04.553
I learnt that from you, didn't I?

33:05.917 --> 33:07.939
Me and Mum are going out at
the weekend to sell her mops.

33:07.956 --> 33:09.084
Do you want to come with us?

33:09.095 --> 33:10.363
I'm seeing Aaron, aren't I?

33:13.228 --> 33:14.521
You can come, if you want.

33:15.764 --> 33:17.801
You can bring Riz, if you like.

33:18.524 --> 33:20.615
Alya's told me I've got
to stay away from him.

33:20.616 --> 33:22.695
Someone needs to tell that
stuck-up cow where to go.

33:22.696 --> 33:23.736
Missy...

33:24.166 --> 33:26.133
I can handle Alya.

33:44.456 --> 33:47.411
I have been thinking
a lot about Mr Quereshi

33:47.498 --> 33:50.412
and what he'd want his legacy to be.

33:51.496 --> 33:53.731
So if I can ask you to do anything,

33:54.943 --> 33:57.018
it is to look out for each other.

33:57.416 --> 33:58.789
Be kind.

33:59.226 --> 34:01.112
Fight for what's right.

34:01.835 --> 34:04.267
And never let anyone

34:04.501 --> 34:07.232
or anything hold you back.

34:08.786 --> 34:10.871
Live life like he would.

34:11.493 --> 34:12.688
Smile.

34:13.121 --> 34:14.690
Open your eyes.

34:15.186 --> 34:16.377
Love.

34:17.184 --> 34:18.447
And go on.

34:31.716 --> 34:32.810
Well done.

34:35.422 --> 34:37.228
I'm sorry about the other day.

34:38.063 --> 34:39.219
It's forgotten.

34:43.295 --> 34:44.367
Emma...

34:50.052 --> 34:51.771
Do one thing for Sami.

34:51.896 --> 34:53.007
What's that?

34:56.210 --> 34:57.357
Be happy.

35:07.756 --> 35:08.762
Cory.

35:10.098 --> 35:12.236
I don't suppose you've heard
from your Jordan, have you?

35:14.420 --> 35:16.914
I called around a few of his
mates but no-one's seen him.

35:19.352 --> 35:20.865
Some brother I am, eh?

35:21.168 --> 35:22.339
What?

35:22.918 --> 35:25.172
Whoa! This is not your fault.

35:26.402 --> 35:29.287
Listen, I know you've had a
tough couple of weeks, but...

35:30.589 --> 35:32.088
Well, I'm always here.

35:32.933 --> 35:34.121
Cheers.

35:34.637 --> 35:35.926
Sir.

35:37.253 --> 35:39.915
Erm, I've seen Jordan.

35:40.678 --> 35:43.315
He, erm, came and took
Jamie to the swings.

35:43.440 --> 35:44.942
Where is he staying?

35:45.005 --> 35:47.810
I don't know. He... He
looked a right state though.

35:47.828 --> 35:49.521
Stank a bit and all.

35:52.676 --> 35:55.041
If he contacts you again,
you come straight to me, yeah?

35:55.059 --> 35:56.107
OK.

36:03.708 --> 36:04.784
Missy?

36:05.101 --> 36:06.125
What's up?

36:07.330 --> 36:10.195
I've sent him four texts and he
hasn't even bothered to reply.

36:10.383 --> 36:11.689
Your boyfriend?

36:12.930 --> 36:14.652
And you're letting him get to you?

36:14.820 --> 36:17.155
Don't always assume the
worst in people, Missy.

36:17.349 --> 36:18.826
You're worth more than this.

36:18.840 --> 36:21.278
Miss Keane's right. You
are the star of the show.

36:21.316 --> 36:22.839
- As if.
- Oi!

36:22.964 --> 36:24.675
Don't sell yourself short.

36:24.932 --> 36:27.849
- She only agreed to do this play cos of you.
- It's true.

36:28.118 --> 36:31.426
What you've got to do is channel
this hurt into something positive.

36:31.676 --> 36:35.362
Like making Cory believe
you actually fancy him.

36:36.152 --> 36:39.411
Go on! Go in there, show the
rest of them how it's done.

36:44.120 --> 36:45.136
You coming?

36:45.174 --> 36:47.945
No, no. It's... This is your thing.

36:54.307 --> 36:56.203
We're all dead nervous, Miss.

36:56.263 --> 36:57.824
What if we forget our lines?

36:57.887 --> 36:59.208
What if no-one shows up?

36:59.215 --> 37:01.290
Right, everyone come
and stand in a circle.

37:01.314 --> 37:02.819
Come on! Everybody!

37:06.658 --> 37:08.006
Everybody!

37:08.440 --> 37:11.251
That's it. Now, I want
you all to hold hands.

37:11.276 --> 37:13.218
Come on, just for a moment. Indulge me.

37:14.200 --> 37:15.675
There were a lot of people out there

37:16.034 --> 37:17.795
that said we couldn't pull this off.

37:18.067 --> 37:20.855
"What do a bunch of kids from Ackley
Bridge know about Shakespeare?"

37:20.872 --> 37:22.116
He's a boss, Miss.

37:22.182 --> 37:23.901
Well, he's not bad for a dead white guy.

37:25.313 --> 37:29.704
But despite my best efforts
to leave you all in the lurch,

37:29.879 --> 37:31.346
you've done an amazing job.

37:31.471 --> 37:33.724
You look brilliant, your
costumes are fantastic

37:33.742 --> 37:35.425
and I'm so impressed with you all,

37:35.439 --> 37:37.445
so I just want you to go out there

37:37.487 --> 37:39.859
and smash it! Go on!

37:55.848 --> 37:56.919
Miss,

37:57.717 --> 37:59.344
this is for Mr Qureshi.

38:08.762 --> 38:11.016
Naveed. You're on.

38:11.812 --> 38:13.084
I can't do it.

38:13.950 --> 38:15.145
Course you can.

38:16.395 --> 38:18.292
If we don't have a Puck,
we don't have a play, do we?

38:18.309 --> 38:19.414
Oh, what do you care?

38:23.644 --> 38:25.094
Well, I'm here, aren't I?

38:31.101 --> 38:32.432
I thought you hated me.

38:36.799 --> 38:38.045
Course not...

38:39.778 --> 38:40.969
... you muppet.

38:42.401 --> 38:45.000
I was just winding you up. That's all.

38:50.002 --> 38:52.032
I'm sorry about what happened.

39:01.694 --> 39:03.039
So you think I'm fit?

39:04.265 --> 39:05.271
Hey?

39:05.676 --> 39:07.727
You and everyone else
in this school, eh?

39:09.925 --> 39:11.825
You're not going to
tell anyone, are you?

39:12.676 --> 39:13.676
No,

39:14.864 --> 39:15.989
course I won't.

39:19.280 --> 39:20.659
Now you get in there

39:21.952 --> 39:23.196
and you smash it.

39:25.777 --> 39:26.936
All right?

39:35.037 --> 39:36.126
Come on, man.

39:55.061 --> 39:56.322
He'll be here.

39:56.553 --> 39:58.890
I've got a sixth sense
about these things.

40:01.409 --> 40:02.510
Come on.

40:07.858 --> 40:09.783
That's my daughter, that is!

40:09.877 --> 40:11.845
She got dyspraxia, you know.

40:30.427 --> 40:33.037
Through the forest have I gone...

40:35.514 --> 40:39.408
... but Athenian found I none. Hm!

40:42.408 --> 40:45.381
- On whose eyes...
- Huh? Is he speaking English?

40:46.135 --> 40:47.811
I don't know.

40:54.434 --> 40:56.108
Night and silence!

40:56.915 --> 40:58.092
Who is here?

40:58.399 --> 41:00.395
Upon thy eyes, I throw

41:00.642 --> 41:04.969
all the power this charm doth owe.

41:08.631 --> 41:11.346
O Bottom, thou art changed!
What do I see on thee?

41:11.363 --> 41:13.246
What do you see? Eh?

41:13.281 --> 41:16.735
Mine ear is much enamoured of thy note.

41:16.952 --> 41:20.215
So is mine eye enthralled to thy shape.

41:34.930 --> 41:37.274
And thy fair virtue's force

41:37.309 --> 41:39.503
perforce doth move me.

41:39.775 --> 41:43.318
On first view to say, to swear,

41:43.443 --> 41:46.525
I love thee.

41:47.217 --> 41:49.275
Goodnight unto you all.

41:49.400 --> 41:51.644
Give me your hands, if we be friends,

41:51.682 --> 41:54.452
and Robin shall restore amends.

42:06.724 --> 42:08.443
Oh, Miss Keane, come on!

42:21.812 --> 42:24.194
My Missy!

42:26.475 --> 42:27.757
You took your time getting here.

42:27.767 --> 42:29.569
Yeah, well, you know, I had to
sort something out, didn't I?

42:29.594 --> 42:31.986
- Well, what did you think?
- Yeah, it was great. I mean,

42:32.000 --> 42:34.515
I didn't understand a word of
it, but you two were amazing.

42:35.462 --> 42:37.547
- Right, come on. We better get off.
- Where?

42:37.918 --> 42:39.629
Well, you'll find out when
we get there, won't ya?

42:40.328 --> 42:41.361
Come on.

42:41.519 --> 42:44.307
We both know how this ends up
- me lying dead in some ditch.

42:44.321 --> 42:47.301
Oh, Missy! Do as you're
told for once. Go, go on!

42:48.387 --> 42:51.255
- Razia were good, no?
- She was brilliant.

42:51.273 --> 42:52.887
Bit like a young Phil Collins.

42:52.915 --> 42:55.414
And you know, her
grades are improving now.

42:55.438 --> 42:57.534
- That's thanks to you.
- Oh.

42:57.618 --> 43:01.401
We're all going to the pub
if you fancy tagging along?

43:01.491 --> 43:04.073
Perfect timing. My mouth's
as dry as a camel's hump.

43:04.094 --> 43:07.042
I was talking to Kaneez.

43:07.073 --> 43:11.434
Oh, no, I got pans
soaking at home, innit?

43:12.024 --> 43:13.173
Mum!

43:14.169 --> 43:16.195
She'd... She'd love to
go with you, Mr Hyatt.

43:16.355 --> 43:17.655
Come on, Simone.

43:21.400 --> 43:23.695
Is everything OK?

43:24.188 --> 43:26.151
It's still too soon.

43:26.601 --> 43:29.172
But, you know, if you
want to come to my house,

43:29.186 --> 43:31.960
we can watch the Gogglebox. Hm?

43:33.169 --> 43:35.086
Yeah, I'd like that.

43:35.555 --> 43:37.186
OK.

43:37.931 --> 43:40.585
Right, come along.

43:41.413 --> 43:42.635
Right, there. There.

43:42.839 --> 43:44.366
You haven't taken me very far.

43:44.376 --> 43:46.340
Just shut up and take
off your blindfold!

43:49.281 --> 43:51.153
It's the playing fields!

43:51.178 --> 43:52.861
Yeah, I know. Look, listen.

43:53.476 --> 43:55.142
I know I didn't get to meet your Nana,

43:55.156 --> 43:58.075
but she sounds like a real special lady.

43:58.324 --> 43:59.595
Yeah, she was.

43:59.764 --> 44:01.322
Hey, let's get this on.

44:01.951 --> 44:04.484
What're you doing? If Ms
Carter finds out we're here...

44:04.498 --> 44:05.972
Just enjoy it, will you?

44:18.332 --> 44:20.151
This one's for you, Nana!

44:22.118 --> 44:23.878
Oh, no!

44:24.101 --> 44:25.515
No, no!

44:25.640 --> 44:27.791
This wasn't supposed to happen!

44:28.436 --> 44:31.913
Oh, come on! You got to be joking me!

44:34.620 --> 44:36.199
Are you all right?

44:37.408 --> 44:39.636
Are you sure? Cos you don't look it.

44:39.881 --> 44:40.942
Marry me.

44:42.556 --> 44:43.911
What did you just say?

44:44.481 --> 44:47.388
Nana always said when
you find something good,

44:47.654 --> 44:49.205
hold on to it.

44:53.509 --> 44:55.592
You're crazy. Do you know that?

44:57.548 --> 44:59.089
So is that a yes?

44:59.924 --> 45:02.330
What? I mean, I don't know!

45:05.872 --> 45:07.150
Yes!
