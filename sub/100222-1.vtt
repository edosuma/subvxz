some people had powers,

Okay, fine.

04:18.214 --> 04:19.171
A tomato.

04:19.215 --> 04:21.391
A tomato.

04:21.435 --> 04:24.089
It's a fruit and a
vegetable, so it's versatile.

Like me, you know?

04:25.134 --> 04:26.744
I can do different things.

Tough crowd, okay, how
would you answer it?

An onion.
Mm-hmm.

04:34.274 --> 04:35.275

11:41.962 --> 11:44.051

The debate continues

11:45.269 --> 11:46.749
whether those giving
up their spinal fluid

11:46.793 --> 11:49.883
should be treated as
victims or traffickers.

11:49.926 --> 11:52.146
Thanks to the courageous
work of our drug unit,

11:52.189 --> 11:54.148
we are winning the war on Psyke.

11:54.191 --> 11:57.020
While it is easy to celebrate
the success of this operation

11:57.064 --> 11:59.893
we must not forget
that violent cartels

11:59.936 --> 12:02.069
continue to poison
our neighborhoods.

12:02.112 --> 12:05.072
The LCPD have also released
the following video,

of which they've come
to call the Psyke run,

12:07.465 --> 12:10.773
a monthly trip to a facility
where the drug is incinerated.

12:10.817 --> 12:12.775
It's their way of saying,
the more you make,

12:12.819 --> 12:14.211
the more we burn.

12:34.188 --> 12:36.712
Mary, why is this frozen?

12:36.756 --> 12:38.583
This can't keep happening.

12:38.627 --> 12:41.195
Your episodes, or whatever
it is you call this,

12:41.238 --> 12:43.284
it's costing me money,
okay, so from here on out,

12:43.327 --> 12:45.460

your goddamn paycheck.

my mom that way.

wait in the car.

12:53.990 --> 12:55.426
What was that?

12:55.470 --> 12:57.167
I'm talking to Mommy, you
should go wait in the car.

12:57.211 --> 12:58.168
You should shut the fuck up.

12:58.212 --> 12:59.213
Connor, stop it.

Stop it!

How many times do
I have to tell you,

13:29.765 --> 13:32.028
never show anyone your power?

13:32.072 --> 13:33.334
What about you?

13:33.377 --> 13:35.771
Frozen sauce on the
ground, how'd that happen?

13:41.995 --> 13:43.953
You need to start chemo.

13:43.997 --> 13:44.998
We don't have the money.

13:45.041 --> 13:45.999
I'll sell the truck.

13:46.042 --> 13:47.261
MARY: It's not gonna be enough.

13:47.304 --> 13:49.089
Then I'll get more
money, whatever it takes.

13:49.132 --> 13:50.351
You sound exactly
like your father.

13:50.394 --> 13:51.569
Oh my god, please don't
bring him into this.

13:51.613 --> 13:53.789
Well then quit acting like him!

13:56.705 --> 13:57.706
I was five.

13:58.533 --> 14:00.100
I barely remember.

14:08.978 --> 14:11.024
CONNOR: Did you know
that guy yesterday?

14:11.067 --> 14:12.460
Nah.

14:12.503 --> 14:14.288
I never seen him before.

14:14.331 --> 14:15.332
Me neither.

14:16.507 --> 14:17.726
Here we go, all right.

14:20.860 --> 14:22.296
Get shot, you fucking loser!

14:23.863 --> 14:27.170
Punk ass bitch.
You gonna throw and run?

14:27.214 --> 14:28.737
God damn.

14:35.439 --> 14:37.485
What the hell's Lincoln
Power doing here?

14:39.400 --> 14:41.228
Nah, you don't wanna
fuck with them.

14:42.142 --> 14:43.621
Buddy, that's Sutcliffe's crew.

14:45.232 --> 14:47.147
Bunch of Psyke runners.

14:54.458 --> 14:56.765
I need an Electric,
class two at least.

15:00.812 --> 15:02.640
So nobody wants
to get paid today?

15:03.554 --> 15:04.642
Okay.

15:04.686 --> 15:06.166
All right.

15:08.255 --> 15:09.778
I'm an Electric.

15:19.092 --> 15:20.484
Need 200 up front, though.

15:21.877 --> 15:22.834
Is that so?

15:22.878 --> 15:24.097
Yo, fuck this guy.

15:25.750 --> 15:27.230
Class two.

15:30.668 --> 15:32.148
Okay.

15:32.496 --> 15:33.628
200 up front.

15:34.803 --> 15:36.283
Get in the van.

16:01.656 --> 16:02.700
What?

16:02.744 --> 16:03.745
GARRETT: He wants
you to put it on.

16:04.920 --> 16:06.617
Fine, just say it, then.

16:06.661 --> 16:09.055
He can't speak, dick.

16:31.512 --> 16:34.254
10 thousand volts, you
better be worth the money.

16:36.778 --> 16:39.694
I'm on a clock,
come on, come on.

16:49.747 --> 16:51.097
Son of a bitch.

16:54.361 --> 16:55.884
Giving up?

17:20.430 --> 17:21.953
Yo-ho.

17:28.699 --> 17:29.700
Class two?

17:35.489 --> 17:37.839
All right, let's do it.

17:48.154 --> 17:49.590
GARRETT: Maddy, get us six.

17:49.633 --> 17:50.765
New guy, help Freddie.

17:52.984 --> 17:54.116
CONNOR: Fuck.

17:56.292 --> 17:57.815
Idiot.

18:04.561 --> 18:06.085
MAN: Hey!

18:07.782 --> 18:09.262
How you doing?

18:09.305 --> 18:11.220
What the hell's going on here?

18:11.264 --> 18:13.396
Fence was shorted,
got called to fix it.

18:15.442 --> 18:17.705
I'm gonna need to see some ID.

18:17.748 --> 18:19.185
Yeah of course,
we'll be right back.

18:19.228 --> 18:21.448
Just hold it right there,
please. I need some back up --

18:21.491 --> 18:22.840
No, no no no.

18:23.972 --> 18:25.974
RADIO: What was that?

18:29.064 --> 18:30.370
I didn't see anything.

18:33.721 --> 18:34.678
No.

18:34.722 --> 18:35.679
Now.

18:35.723 --> 18:36.941
I'll just go --

18:36.985 --> 18:37.942
My friend's gonna
squash your head.

18:37.986 --> 18:39.161
Get in the fucking dumpster.

18:45.341 --> 18:46.603
You're just gonna
leave him in there?

18:46.647 --> 18:48.823
Yeah, I mean, he has
a flashlight, so.

18:49.911 --> 18:51.391
Let's go, in the van!

18:56.961 --> 18:58.398
TOWER: All units in zone nine,

18:58.441 --> 19:00.965
got a report of a break
in at Jones Chemical.

19:01.009 --> 19:02.750
Suspects last seen
in a red cargo van

19:02.793 --> 19:04.186
headed east on Short Avenue.

19:07.189 --> 19:08.669
Just pay me out.

19:09.104 --> 19:10.149
Drop me off.

19:10.192 --> 19:11.411
Job's not done.

19:11.454 --> 19:12.977
Sit tight.

19:15.937 --> 19:18.853
MADDY: Fuck, these
things are everywhere.

19:18.896 --> 19:20.637
PILOT: 1-1-3, no
sign of vehicle.

19:21.769 --> 19:23.771
TOWER: I need additional
eyes in zone nine.

19:23.814 --> 19:27.818
PILOT: D-1-0-8, responding,
entering zone nine.

19:28.863 --> 19:30.038
MADDY: Garret?

19:30.081 --> 19:32.258
GARRETT: Relax, you'll
scare the new guy.

19:41.267 --> 19:42.572
Start peeling, let's go.

19:58.197 --> 19:59.633
PILOT: I got a cargo van
heading south on Franklin.

19:59.676 --> 20:01.025
Descending below 100.

20:02.113 --> 20:03.071
MADDY: Fuck.

20:03.114 --> 20:04.203
GARRETT: Stay calm.

20:06.030 --> 20:07.684
TOWER: 1-1-3, what's the call?

20:14.343 --> 20:15.605
PILOT: Negative.

20:15.649 --> 20:17.041
Vehicle doesn't
match description.

20:17.085 --> 20:18.565
Moving on.

20:29.010 --> 20:30.403
MADDY: Fuck, that was close.

20:53.121 --> 20:54.601
We got it.

20:54.644 --> 20:55.863
Where's Sutcliffe?

20:59.823 --> 21:01.303
Let's go.

21:10.747 --> 21:12.009
You saw the news, right?

21:14.751 --> 21:18.059
It was my farm in Riverton
that got raided two days ago.

21:19.190 --> 21:20.409
I mean, the cops
grabbed all my shit --

21:20.453 --> 21:23.064
You read minds, do you
not, Mr. Sutcliffe?

21:25.458 --> 21:26.981
Read theirs.

21:29.200 --> 21:31.159
Tell me what they're thinking.

21:41.125 --> 21:43.954
She's thinking of different
ways of slitting my throat.

21:44.825 --> 21:47.131
You have one week to pay.

21:47.175 --> 21:49.308
Otherwise we will be forced
to make alternate plans

21:49.351 --> 21:50.352
for ourselves.

21:52.354 --> 21:53.442
And for you.

22:13.549 --> 22:16.987
They have enough hyrdo
to make Psyke for a year.

22:17.031 --> 22:18.467
Who's the new kid?

22:18.511 --> 22:21.383
Connor, this is
Marcus Sutcliffe.

22:22.210 --> 22:23.690
Connor.

22:28.608 --> 22:30.392
Anger.

22:30.436 --> 22:31.611
No, no, no, no.

22:32.525 --> 22:34.048
Useful.

22:34.875 --> 22:37.399
Nia, will you show this
young man around, please?

22:38.444 --> 22:39.706
You and I need to talk.

22:50.760 --> 22:52.893
NIA: What do you want?

22:52.936 --> 22:55.069
Nothing, I'm good.

22:56.375 --> 22:58.115
You sure?
It's on Marcus.

22:58.159 --> 23:00.204
Booze, girls.

23:00.248 --> 23:01.380
Psyke.

23:01.423 --> 23:02.946
Nah, just passing through.

23:04.948 --> 23:06.385
Passing through, right.

23:11.564 --> 23:13.609
I can't pay you, not right now.

23:15.089 --> 23:16.525
I've got three drums
in the back of my van.

23:16.569 --> 23:19.702
Head office said that
they are done waiting.

23:19.746 --> 23:21.878
We need money to keep
those wolves at bay.

23:23.053 --> 23:24.141
If we don't get
them something soon,

23:24.185 --> 23:25.404
they are gonna come calling.

23:26.622 --> 23:29.625
And not just for me,
do you understand?

23:32.498 --> 23:34.848
How good is that Electric?
The kid?

23:34.891 --> 23:37.459
Yeah, he's strong, he
doesn't know how strong yet.

23:37.503 --> 23:40.157
Look, I've got a lead
on something real.

23:40.201 --> 23:41.681
Something good.

23:42.377 --> 23:43.596
I need time to work him.

23:43.639 --> 23:45.424
Get on him now.

23:45.467 --> 23:46.512
You do this job for me

23:46.555 --> 23:48.252
and you are right
back where you were.

23:49.340 --> 23:50.864
Right back where I was,

23:52.213 --> 23:53.693
and more.

23:59.612 --> 24:01.135
Get them back.

24:02.658 --> 24:04.486
What about you?

24:04.530 --> 24:05.966
What do you do here?

24:08.534 --> 24:09.839
He needs you.

24:12.886 --> 24:14.409
He needs you now.

24:18.718 --> 24:21.155
NIA: I'll see you around.

24:37.867 --> 24:38.912
Okay.

24:44.744 --> 24:45.745
Connor.

24:48.138 --> 24:49.662
We got another job coming up.

24:51.011 --> 24:53.143
Make a lot more money
than you made today.

24:55.537 --> 24:56.538
300 bucks.

24:57.713 --> 24:59.236
Consider it a bonus for tonight.

25:00.803 --> 25:04.546
You wanna make more, we'll
see you tomorrow morning.

25:04.590 --> 25:05.634
You got talent.

25:07.680 --> 25:09.203
Don't waste it.

25:22.390 --> 25:23.826
Just get in?

25:23.870 --> 25:26.699
Yeah, got picked
up late for a job.

25:26.742 --> 25:28.962
Wow, didn't know
you were working.

25:29.005 --> 25:31.878
Yeah, uh, it was construction.

25:31.921 --> 25:34.445
Job's behind so the
pay was pretty good.

25:34.489 --> 25:35.969
Great.

25:46.196 --> 25:48.721
I went back to the store
today and got my old job back.

25:48.764 --> 25:50.723
Mom, that guy's an asshole.

25:50.766 --> 25:53.203
He is, but we need the money.

25:53.247 --> 25:56.032
I know, I just, I don't
like you working there.

25:56.076 --> 25:58.818
I don't like it either, but
'til that money tree blooms

25:58.861 --> 26:01.821
in the backyard, we don't
have much of a choice.

26:01.864 --> 26:03.779
Yeah, yeah, wouldn't
that be nice.

26:10.873 --> 26:12.396
It's gonna be okay.

26:13.789 --> 26:16.313
I know it doesn't seem
like that right now, but,

26:18.054 --> 26:19.316
it's all gonna work out.

26:21.710 --> 26:26.715
Yeah.

26:43.340 --> 26:44.951
Come on.

26:44.994 --> 26:46.779
I want some more.

26:51.958 --> 26:54.177
MARCUS: What do you want?

26:54.221 --> 26:55.701
I'm out.

26:57.224 --> 26:58.486
MARCUS: Get out.

26:58.529 --> 27:00.401
Why, we're having --
Get the fuck out!

27:04.100 --> 27:05.624
WOMAN: Bitch.

27:09.628 --> 27:10.672
Is this what you want?

27:12.848 --> 27:14.023
Come and get it.

27:19.028 --> 27:20.073
No, no.

27:22.771 --> 27:24.294
Come on.

27:26.862 --> 27:28.037
Me first.

27:30.823 --> 27:32.346
Mm-hmm.

27:46.229 --> 27:49.145
No cams but it's
definitely Psyke related.

27:49.189 --> 27:51.844
Why he took the
Hydro, 200 gallons.

27:53.062 --> 27:54.542
Sutcliffe's watering
down his shit that bad

27:54.585 --> 27:56.457
and you know he's hurting.

27:56.500 --> 27:57.850
What else we got?

27:57.893 --> 27:58.938
Yeah.

27:58.981 --> 28:01.984
Guard was attacked
by a TK and a Brawn.

28:02.028 --> 28:04.987
Pyro blew the lock, and
Electric fried the whole fence.

28:05.031 --> 28:07.294
PARK: How many Electrics
in town that strong?

28:07.337 --> 28:09.383
Let's see who fits the profile.

28:09.426 --> 28:10.950
DAVIS: I'll work up some names.

28:16.172 --> 28:18.740
So how was your job
yesterday?

28:19.610 --> 28:20.568
It was fine.

28:20.611 --> 28:23.179
It was weird, I don't know.

28:23.223 --> 28:24.659
Pay was good.

28:24.703 --> 28:26.095
Yeah?

28:26.139 --> 28:28.794
You gotta be careful
with those guys.

28:28.837 --> 28:30.360
I know.

28:32.319 --> 28:34.103
TRAVIS: Let's do this.

28:39.369 --> 28:41.154
Gentlemen, listen up.

28:41.197 --> 28:45.419
I need a full day, six crew,
two Brawn, two Electric.

28:49.336 --> 28:50.641
Let's go.

28:50.685 --> 28:51.642
WORKER: Come on, man, what
are you talking about,

28:51.686 --> 28:52.905
you can always use one.

28:52.948 --> 28:55.168
WORKER: I was good
in the last one.

28:55.211 --> 28:56.691
See you tomorrow.

29:00.826 --> 29:02.436
JOE: Not using you, understand?

29:02.479 --> 29:03.959
WORKER: Come on, man.

29:12.315 --> 29:13.795
I don't know what that means.

29:13.839 --> 29:14.796
He wants your bacon.

29:14.840 --> 29:16.189
Yeah, yeah, it's fine.

29:18.060 --> 29:20.280
You know, I'm wondering
why a guy like you

29:20.323 --> 29:22.978
is associating himself with a
group of degenerates like us.

29:23.022 --> 29:25.415
Who you calling degenerates?

29:25.459 --> 29:27.113
Fred, you hear this shit?

29:27.156 --> 29:28.636
You found me.

29:28.679 --> 29:29.811
You got in the van.

29:31.117 --> 29:32.074
Why?

29:32.118 --> 29:33.075
I need money.

29:33.119 --> 29:34.163
Could've got in any other truck.

29:34.207 --> 29:36.165
Paid a semi-honest day's work.

29:36.209 --> 29:37.166
They don't pay enough.

29:37.210 --> 29:38.167
For what?

29:38.211 --> 29:39.168
Doesn't matter.

29:39.212 --> 29:40.256
It matters to me.

29:43.738 --> 29:45.653
We need to know who
we're working with.

29:48.177 --> 29:49.700
My mom's sick.

29:56.272 --> 29:57.317
Okay.

29:58.448 --> 30:00.320
We'll see what you can do.

30:01.408 --> 30:02.888
Let's go.

30:09.285 --> 30:10.852
He says good luck.

30:10.896 --> 30:12.375
Thanks.

30:16.249 --> 30:17.859
See this car?

30:17.903 --> 30:19.078
We need it.

30:19.121 --> 30:20.819
Short the alarm.

30:20.862 --> 30:22.342
What?

30:22.385 --> 30:23.734
What you looking down there
for, car's right here.

30:24.779 --> 30:25.780
Fuck.

30:28.783 --> 30:30.350
What the hell's going on,
I thought there was a job.

30:30.393 --> 30:32.047
Yeah, there is, in three days
we're knocking over a bank,

30:32.091 --> 30:33.309
and you're nowhere near ready.

30:33.353 --> 30:34.963
So until then,
you stick with me,

30:35.007 --> 30:38.227
you do what I do,
and you do as I say.

30:38.271 --> 30:39.838
Short the alarm.

30:42.231 --> 30:43.798
What's my cut of the bank?

30:43.842 --> 30:45.887
25K.

30:54.113 --> 30:56.245
GARRETT: Your mother
raised you on her own?

30:56.289 --> 30:57.507
Dad died when I was young.

30:58.508 --> 31:00.946
Safe to assume he was one of us.

31:00.989 --> 31:02.512
Yeah, Electric.

31:03.513 --> 31:06.342
Got shot holding
up a liquor store.

31:06.386 --> 31:08.214
So your mom raised
you without powers

31:08.257 --> 31:10.259
to make sure you
didn't end up like him.

31:28.974 --> 31:30.497
Light it.

31:31.454 --> 31:32.542
And keep it lit.

31:38.984 --> 31:40.594
Come on, man, I just need a
little bit more time, alright?

31:40.637 --> 31:42.161
GARRETT: Not a fucking clock.

31:42.204 --> 31:43.510
Where's the money?

31:43.553 --> 31:44.815
Nobody wants to buy
that hydro shit, man!

31:48.515 --> 31:50.473
You know we built
this city, right?

31:50.517 --> 31:53.650
Ran the mills, we built the
buildings, we built the roads.

31:53.694 --> 31:55.304
Then they brought
in these machines,

31:55.348 --> 31:57.959
not to drive the profit line,
they did it to drive us out.

31:59.265 --> 32:02.703
Because normal people
have always hated us.

32:02.746 --> 32:05.010
They just used to do it
with a smile on their face.

32:12.582 --> 32:13.627
Okay.

32:14.584 --> 32:16.064
Where's the rest?

32:17.631 --> 32:19.415
That's what he gave me.
Did you count it?

32:19.459 --> 32:20.764
I'm just supposed to
count it, right there?

32:20.808 --> 32:22.766
I don't give a fuck
where you count it,

32:22.810 --> 32:24.029
you always count it!

32:25.291 --> 32:26.814
Okay.

32:42.351 --> 32:44.745
Okay, the guy over there's
the guy who shorted you.

32:44.788 --> 32:47.313
I don't fuck with
Electrics, so you be ready.

32:48.531 --> 32:50.185
How do you wanna
live in this life?

32:50.229 --> 32:52.013
Do what they want us to
do, live by their rules,

32:52.057 --> 32:54.450
hide our powers, fuck that.

32:54.494 --> 32:57.584
You are and always will
be a class five Electric.

32:58.672 --> 32:59.760
Mikey!

32:59.803 --> 33:01.501
I want my money.

33:01.544 --> 33:02.893
Things have changed, man.

33:02.937 --> 33:04.591
The Trust came to me
directly,

33:04.634 --> 33:06.985
and they told me
you guys are dead.

33:07.028 --> 33:09.030
This is my territory now, so
why don't you get the fuck --

33:09.074 --> 33:10.684
Get the fuck off.

33:20.737 --> 33:22.043
Be who you are.

33:22.087 --> 33:24.567
And if you see something
that you want, take it.

33:35.491 --> 33:39.800
Mary's not working tonight,
so, if you'll excuse --

33:42.020 --> 33:43.325
Keep focused.

33:44.674 --> 33:45.806
Hold it, Connor.

33:50.680 --> 33:51.725
Surge!

34:27.978 --> 34:29.458
Hey.

34:29.806 --> 34:30.764
You okay?

34:30.807 --> 34:32.026
MARY: Yeah.

34:33.636 --> 34:35.682
You know that
interview I went for?

34:37.553 --> 34:38.815
Yeah.

34:38.859 --> 34:39.990
They called me back.

34:41.557 --> 34:42.558
And?

34:46.954 --> 34:48.042
You got the job?

34:48.086 --> 34:49.739
I got the job.

34:49.783 --> 34:50.871
MARY: You got the job!

34:53.917 --> 34:55.223
If it goes well, you know,

34:55.267 --> 34:57.921
maybe we can get you
in to see someone.

34:57.965 --> 34:59.793
Okay, okay.

34:59.836 --> 35:00.881
See?

35:00.924 --> 35:02.274
Things will work out.

35:03.318 --> 35:04.841
I know.

35:07.975 --> 35:09.629
PARK: This one's a class five.

35:09.672 --> 35:12.284
26, no record, still
living at home.

35:12.327 --> 35:15.635
No job, knee deep
in medical bills.

35:15.678 --> 35:16.810
DAVIS: What are you thinking?

35:16.853 --> 35:17.898
Life hits you hard enough,

35:17.941 --> 35:19.682
you're gonna start hitting back.

35:21.119 --> 35:22.946
Seems to me that
certain people do.

35:27.299 --> 35:29.866
PARK: Pin his face to the wall.

35:38.614 --> 35:39.920
TELLER: I can take you here.

35:39.963 --> 35:40.921
Thank you.

35:40.964 --> 35:42.836
Emily, that's a lovely name.

35:42.879 --> 35:44.185
What can I do for you today?

35:44.229 --> 35:45.534
Tell them what you saw.

35:46.666 --> 35:48.668
CONNOR: Two guards
watching our every move,

35:48.711 --> 35:50.974
with SMGs, cameras
in every corner.

35:51.018 --> 35:54.021
And the vault's being controlled
somewhere outside the bank.

35:54.064 --> 35:55.327
It's a two part lock.

35:55.370 --> 35:56.850
First part is combination,

35:56.893 --> 35:59.244
second part is someone
offsite verifying who gets in.

36:00.462 --> 36:01.724
They control the
power to the door,

36:01.768 --> 36:03.161
but you can short
it with a surge.

36:03.204 --> 36:04.423
And trigger the alarm.

36:05.685 --> 36:08.253
Drone's best time
is seven minutes?

36:08.296 --> 36:10.255
We're out of there in five.

36:13.606 --> 36:14.563
Hey.

36:14.607 --> 36:15.956
I'm all done in aisle three,

36:15.999 --> 36:17.697
do you want me to start
loading in from the back?

36:17.740 --> 36:19.699
No, I'll get someone
else to do that.

36:21.266 --> 36:23.920
But, there is nobody else.

36:23.964 --> 36:25.966
Look, I don't want
any problems, okay?

36:27.185 --> 36:28.186
I'll do it.

36:38.631 --> 36:42.069
Now, on cash advances,
your rate of 19.99%

36:42.112 --> 36:43.723
becomes effective immediately.

36:44.941 --> 36:47.205
MADDY: A lot of people seen
inside.

36:47.248 --> 36:49.424
GARRETT: Nothing
we can't handle.

36:49.468 --> 36:50.991
Let's go.

37:01.480 --> 37:02.698
FEMALE: You're okay.

37:02.742 --> 37:04.222
GARRETT: Everybody
on the ground!

37:04.265 --> 37:05.658
Right fucking now!

37:06.963 --> 37:08.138
If you move, we hurt you.

37:10.010 --> 37:11.272
Get to work.

37:22.457 --> 37:24.285
Get the fuck down!

37:35.688 --> 37:38.038
GARRETT: We know who you
are, we know where you live.

37:38.081 --> 37:40.345
Don't fuck around.

37:40.388 --> 37:42.085
TOWER: We got an alarm
at Lincoln Dominion Bank

37:42.129 --> 37:43.478
in zone seven.

37:43.522 --> 37:45.088
Possible robbery in progress.

37:45.132 --> 37:46.264
PILOT: Copy.

37:46.307 --> 37:47.787
D-1-1-2 is four minutes out.

37:52.400 --> 37:55.490
GARRETT: This is not the time
to get forgetful, let's go!

37:55.534 --> 37:56.665
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

37:56.709 --> 37:58.276
CONNOR: It's okay, it's okay.

37:58.319 --> 38:00.321
Okay, you're okay,
deep breaths.

38:00.365 --> 38:01.322
All right?

38:01.366 --> 38:02.454
Deep breaths.

38:02.497 --> 38:04.282
One number at a time.

38:04.325 --> 38:05.544
Then you get to go home.

38:21.342 --> 38:24.345
GARRETT: Get on the
ground, don't move.

38:28.131 --> 38:29.437
What the
fuck?

38:29.481 --> 38:30.612
CONNOR: What?

38:30.656 --> 38:32.353
GARRETT: Start packing.

38:32.397 --> 38:33.354
Get up!

38:35.225 --> 38:36.183
Where's the
rest?

38:36.226 --> 38:37.402
Rest of what?

38:37.445 --> 38:39.142
GARRETT: The 500
thousand dollars

38:39.186 --> 38:41.493
that's supposed to be
in your fucking vault!

38:41.536 --> 38:43.321
They cleared the vault
before the weekend.

38:43.364 --> 38:44.322
GARRETT: When!

38:44.365 --> 38:46.411
Four o'clock today.

38:49.544 --> 38:50.763
Fuck!

38:50.806 --> 38:52.373
TOWER: Confirmed
robbery in progress.

38:52.417 --> 38:54.767
All units in zone seven
to Lincoln Dominion Bank,

38:54.810 --> 38:55.811
code eight.

38:55.855 --> 38:57.291
PILOT: 20 seconds to target.

38:58.248 --> 38:59.206
GARRETT: Fucking --

38:59.249 --> 39:00.425
MADDY: Hey!

39:00.468 --> 39:01.904
We gotta go.

39:06.039 --> 39:07.388
GARRETT: Fuck!

39:07.432 --> 39:09.782
CONNOR: We gotta go,
shit.

39:09.825 --> 39:11.131
GARRETT: Back door.

39:11.174 --> 39:12.698
Keep your fucking heads down.

39:12.741 --> 39:14.395
CONNOR: It's over.

39:16.441 --> 39:19.052
Where'd all the
goddamn money go?

39:20.923 --> 39:22.621
ANNOUNCER: This is the police!

39:22.664 --> 39:24.405
Stop where you are
and do not move.

39:24.449 --> 39:26.451
Get down on the ground with
your hands behind your head.

39:26.494 --> 39:27.452
If you do not --

39:27.495 --> 39:28.453
Connor, do it.
We'll be shot.

39:28.496 --> 39:29.454
What?

39:29.497 --> 39:31.107
Remote surge.

39:31.151 --> 39:34.284
ANNOUNCER: Get down now,
this is your final warning.

39:34.328 --> 39:36.852
Do it right now,
or we're fucked.

39:36.896 --> 39:41.074
MEGAPHONE: If you do not
comply you will be shot.

39:41.117 --> 39:44.338
Guardian's ready.
What's he doing?

39:44.382 --> 39:45.774
PILOT: He's gonna hit the drone

39:45.818 --> 39:46.949
FEMALE: Deploy, now!

39:46.993 --> 39:48.386
GARRETT: Do it!

39:53.608 --> 39:56.089
PILOT: Losing control,
engine one is down.

39:56.132 --> 39:57.090
Losing engine three --

39:58.483 --> 40:01.573
Two is going down, I
repeat, two is going down.

40:07.274 --> 40:08.406
Drone down,
drone town!

40:08.449 --> 40:09.581
TOWER: Drone down.

40:09.624 --> 40:10.582
All my controls --
EMP fired at --

40:10.625 --> 40:11.887
MALE: Anyone else hearing this?

40:11.931 --> 40:13.236
FEMALE: All units to
Lincoln Dominion Bank.

40:13.280 --> 40:14.412
FEMALE: Suspect is a
high level Electric.

40:14.455 --> 40:16.196
MALE: We're 50 kilometers out.

40:19.765 --> 40:20.940
Fuck!

40:20.983 --> 40:23.116
Fuck, fuck,
fuck!

40:37.522 --> 40:38.479
Where's the rest?

40:38.523 --> 40:39.828
The vault was cleared out.

40:39.872 --> 40:41.351
MARCUS: What the
fuck do you mean?

40:44.354 --> 40:46.139
That's only 50 thousand dollars.

40:46.182 --> 40:48.010
Those pick up times
are on you to know.

40:48.054 --> 40:50.230
Now how the fuck do
we pay back the Trust?

40:51.405 --> 40:53.494
This is 10% of what we wanted.

40:54.669 --> 40:56.671
Okay, so the job's a bust.

40:56.715 --> 40:58.064
Boo fucking hoo.

40:58.107 --> 40:59.587
You cleared the fucking
job!

40:59.631 --> 41:00.675
Tone it down, boy.

41:02.634 --> 41:04.026
Tread very carefully, Garrett.

41:14.036 --> 41:15.647
What the hell!

41:15.690 --> 41:17.431
Get the fuck away from me.

41:17.475 --> 41:19.128
Fucking piece of shit,
get out!

41:29.399 --> 41:31.967
Use your fucking head, figure
out a way to fill this out!

41:32.011 --> 41:32.968
Gun.

41:33.012 --> 41:33.969
Gun!

42:21.756 --> 42:24.803
Make sure it's done cleanly.

42:24.846 --> 42:27.762
Talk like that again, it'll
be you going in that van.

42:29.895 --> 42:31.026
Get your hand off me.

42:45.475 --> 42:46.738
Look, I know where
these guys are.

42:46.781 --> 42:48.870
We gotta move on them
before they hit us again.

42:48.914 --> 42:51.351
It's a fucking easy target,
I can hit it tonight.

42:52.221 --> 42:53.788
Oh, Garrett,

42:53.832 --> 42:57.139
you don't seem to get how
fucked we are, do you?

42:57.183 --> 42:59.489
You don't go to
war with The Trust.

43:00.447 --> 43:02.405
We can't take this lying down.

43:02.449 --> 43:03.842
We're gonna lost
our entire business.

43:03.885 --> 43:05.626
It's my business!

43:11.763 --> 43:13.286
Go do what I say.

43:48.060 --> 43:49.583
Nia.

43:51.585 --> 43:53.065
Nia.

43:57.547 --> 43:59.027
You okay?

43:59.680 --> 44:01.160
Yeah.

44:17.132 --> 44:19.091
That was fucking insane.

44:21.963 --> 44:24.009
Wasn't the first time
I've had a gun on me.

44:25.837 --> 44:27.447
Going after Marcus I get.

44:29.449 --> 44:30.798
Why go after his girl?

44:30.842 --> 44:32.365
I'm not his girl.

44:33.627 --> 44:34.889
Not like that.

44:34.933 --> 44:37.805
That's not what
I mean, I just...

44:48.990 --> 44:49.948
Give me your arm.

44:49.991 --> 44:52.298
I'm fine, it was nothing.

45:04.310 --> 45:06.094
What are you doing?

45:06.138 --> 45:07.182
Trust me.

45:21.283 --> 45:23.068
CONNOR: Oh, my God.

45:40.520 --> 45:41.739
You're a Healer.

45:46.569 --> 45:48.310
That's why they went after me.

45:48.354 --> 45:49.572
Why do you heal him?

45:53.011 --> 45:54.447
I have my reasons.

45:56.928 --> 45:57.885
For Psyke?

45:57.929 --> 45:59.713
It's not just that.

45:59.757 --> 46:01.106
I'm paying off a debt.

46:04.892 --> 46:06.415
Hey.

46:07.939 --> 46:09.288
He wants to go.

46:12.378 --> 46:13.335
NIA: Don't touch me.

46:13.379 --> 46:14.380
Fucking junkie.

46:32.224 --> 46:33.268
Connor?

46:47.369 --> 46:48.457
Where'd you get this?

46:49.807 --> 46:50.764
It's overtime at
work.

46:50.808 --> 46:52.157
Don't lie to me!

46:57.902 --> 47:01.209
I called over there, and
they'd never even heard of you.

47:03.646 --> 47:04.647
We need the money.

47:05.910 --> 47:07.433
After everything
I've taught you,

47:07.476 --> 47:08.782
how could you be so stupid?

47:08.826 --> 47:10.915
Mom, I tried it your way,
it doesn't work, okay?

47:10.958 --> 47:12.351
They're not giving us
a chance out there.

47:12.394 --> 47:13.439
You sound just like your father.

47:13.482 --> 47:15.876
So what, at least
he did something.

47:15.920 --> 47:18.618
Hey, at least he was trying,
what do you expect me to do?

47:18.661 --> 47:21.969
You are running out of
time, okay, look at you.

47:22.013 --> 47:25.016
I'm not just gonna sit
around and watch you die.

47:41.380 --> 47:43.121
Mom, Mom, no, no.

47:44.252 --> 47:45.297
Mom.

47:45.340 --> 47:46.951
Come on, come on, come on.

47:46.994 --> 47:48.517
Mom, please!

47:51.129 --> 47:53.348
It's spreading faster
than we thought.

47:53.392 --> 47:56.177
The tumor's pressing her
brain up against the skull.

47:56.221 --> 47:59.441
That's what's causing her to
lose control of her abilities.

48:00.834 --> 48:02.749
Frankly it's good
that she's here.

48:02.792 --> 48:05.360
She could've been very
dangerous in public.

48:05.404 --> 48:06.535
And it's treatable?

48:07.885 --> 48:09.712
Well, her condition's been
neglected for too long.

48:09.756 --> 48:12.454
If we're gonna beat this, we
need to operate right away.

48:16.415 --> 48:19.418
I'll leave you to
think about it.

48:23.291 --> 48:24.814
Here's the total
for the surgery.

48:24.858 --> 48:26.294
It doesn't include
the recovery room,

48:26.338 --> 48:27.730
which is seven
thousand for the week.

48:27.774 --> 48:29.080
And the anesthesia's
only covered

48:29.123 --> 48:30.951
up to first five
thousand dollars.

48:30.995 --> 48:33.954
Once we get the down payment,
we can move her into pre-op.

48:33.998 --> 48:36.609
If you require a loan,
you'll need to - .

48:43.007 --> 48:44.530
Connor Reed.

48:45.748 --> 48:48.012
I'm Officer Park and
this is Officer Davis.

48:48.055 --> 48:49.578
Got a minute?

48:50.971 --> 48:52.451
No.

48:54.018 --> 48:56.411
Can't say you come from
great stock, Connor.

48:57.586 --> 48:59.675
Your old man wasn't
exactly a model citizen.

49:02.678 --> 49:04.985
Chemical plant up on East Fifth.

49:05.029 --> 49:07.074
Lincoln Dominion Bank.

49:07.118 --> 49:09.120
You know anything
about these robberies?

49:10.556 --> 49:12.036
No.

49:12.079 --> 49:14.212
Word has it you're running
with Garrett Kelton.

49:14.255 --> 49:16.779
He's got a rap sheet
roughly the size of my dick.

49:16.823 --> 49:17.998
So, short and thin?

49:19.086 --> 49:20.522
Garrett Kelton
happens to be working

49:20.566 --> 49:22.655
for the biggest piece
of shit in Lincoln City.

49:22.698 --> 49:24.918
DAVIS: You ever hear
of Marcus Sutcliffe?

49:24.962 --> 49:26.137
PARK: We burn more of his Psyke

49:26.180 --> 49:28.704
than any other dealer in LC.

49:28.748 --> 49:30.619
DAVIS: How much we
lighting up next week?

49:30.663 --> 49:32.360
PARK: Four million dollars.

49:34.449 --> 49:37.061
Just a matter of time before
that asshole goes down.

49:37.104 --> 49:39.889
Mm-hmm, and everybody
who works for him.

49:43.415 --> 49:44.764
Look, Connor.

49:45.634 --> 49:46.635
We know about your mom.

49:48.289 --> 49:49.812
I know she's sick.

49:50.422 --> 49:52.554
You know you got mixed
up with some bad people.

49:54.817 --> 49:56.689
I'd do the same for my family.

49:58.865 --> 50:01.172
But you gotta give me
something on Sutcliffe.

50:03.696 --> 50:05.176
I can help you.

50:11.660 --> 50:14.620
Do you wanna spend
your Mom's last days

50:14.663 --> 50:16.839
taking it in the ass from
every Brawn in the pen?

50:16.883 --> 50:17.884
Don't talk about my mom.

50:17.927 --> 50:20.060
Ooh, you hear that, Park?

50:20.104 --> 50:21.322
I think he got real
attached to her

50:21.366 --> 50:23.716
ever since we put his
daddy on his back.

50:23.759 --> 50:24.978
PARK: Davis.

50:25.022 --> 50:26.588
There he is, come on,
do something tough guy,

50:26.632 --> 50:28.721
because I would love nothing
more than to bury you

50:28.764 --> 50:30.201
next to your
failure of a father.

50:30.244 --> 50:31.767
Davis.

50:37.773 --> 50:40.037
I'd double-check that footage.

50:41.168 --> 50:42.561
You got the wrong guy.

50:55.704 --> 50:57.271
DAVIS: All right, let's do it,

50:57.315 --> 50:58.925
let's get back in there,
I'm gonna give him the slip.

50:58.968 --> 51:00.144
I think we let him go.

51:01.101 --> 51:02.581
What?

51:03.103 --> 51:05.714
Sorry, it sounded like
you said let him go.

51:05.758 --> 51:07.238
We gave him our offer.

51:07.281 --> 51:09.588
Yeah, he spit it
back in our face!

51:09.631 --> 51:12.025
All we have is a class five
with shaky surveillance.

51:12.069 --> 51:13.809
DA won't touch it.

51:13.853 --> 51:17.465
Then, we go to his house,

51:17.509 --> 51:20.947
and we make sure that we
find a whole bunch of Psyke,

51:20.990 --> 51:22.818
and we get this done.

51:22.862 --> 51:25.821
You cross that line, Davis,
there's no coming back.

51:27.040 --> 51:28.520
Look, man.

51:29.260 --> 51:31.610
I get you wanna cut
deals and turn informants

51:31.653 --> 51:33.351
and build a case,
I'm all for that,

51:33.394 --> 51:34.743
but don't forget for one second

51:34.787 --> 51:37.094
how dangerous these
people can be.

51:43.970 --> 51:44.971
She's blinding you.

52:07.646 --> 52:08.995
What did you say in there?

52:09.038 --> 52:10.301
We need to see Marcus.

52:10.344 --> 52:11.824
Nah, you don't get to
walk out of a cop shop

52:11.867 --> 52:12.825
and ask for a meeting.

52:12.868 --> 52:14.174
I didn't say shit.

52:15.393 --> 52:17.003
You don't believe me,
I'll see him myself.

52:17.046 --> 52:18.526
About what?

52:20.049 --> 52:21.529
A job.

52:45.031 --> 52:46.075
Ah.

52:46.119 --> 52:47.251
Look who it is.

52:53.474 --> 52:54.997
Don't blink.

53:03.484 --> 53:04.485
Kid's the real deal.

53:05.356 --> 53:06.879
Kept his mouth shut.

53:08.968 --> 53:12.885
How much pure did the cops
pull off you last month?

53:12.928 --> 53:14.321
Four sleeves.

53:14.365 --> 53:16.454
Four sleeves off you, three
sleeves off the East Side,

53:16.497 --> 53:17.803
two off the South?

53:17.846 --> 53:19.239
We take nine sleeves,
we step it down,

53:19.283 --> 53:21.328
what's that worth on the street?

53:21.372 --> 53:22.895
10 million?

53:23.504 --> 53:25.463
10 million dollars.

53:26.551 --> 53:27.987
And in three days,

53:28.030 --> 53:30.381
these motherfuckers are
gonna incinerate it.

53:32.470 --> 53:33.993
You're gonna hit the Psyke run.

53:34.036 --> 53:36.648
You get the Psyke, I get her.

53:40.739 --> 53:42.219
Oh.

53:42.654 --> 53:44.177
That's sweet.

53:46.397 --> 53:48.181
Someone has a poor dying Mommy.

53:50.923 --> 53:52.098
We got a deal?

53:56.798 --> 53:58.583
Yeah, we got a deal.

54:01.499 --> 54:03.196
Don't worry, I'll
get her to behave.

54:04.545 --> 54:06.199
Um.

54:06.243 --> 54:07.722
One more thing.

54:09.550 --> 54:11.117
What's that?

54:11.160 --> 54:12.684
We're partners.

54:19.168 --> 54:20.431
50/50.

54:22.737 --> 54:24.783
Do you remember when
I first found you?

54:26.350 --> 54:27.699
You were eating out of a
dumpster like a little

54:27.742 --> 54:30.484
stray dog.

54:30.528 --> 54:32.094
Do you remember that, Garrett?

54:32.138 --> 54:34.706
How I took you in,
I cleaned you up,

54:34.749 --> 54:38.623
and I gave you all the
things you didn't have?

54:38.666 --> 54:40.102
I'm grateful.

54:40.146 --> 54:41.800
But let me explain something.

54:41.843 --> 54:44.368
There's too much territory,
and there's too much product,

54:44.411 --> 54:47.284
to lay it all at the
feet of one person.

54:47.327 --> 54:48.850
We work this together.

54:48.894 --> 54:51.418
We pay off the Trust,
then you and me,

54:52.506 --> 54:54.247
we won't be answering to anyone.

54:56.641 --> 54:58.164
You and me.

55:00.209 --> 55:01.689
You and me.

55:08.827 --> 55:10.307
Okay, Garrett.

55:11.177 --> 55:12.657
You have a deal.

55:14.398 --> 55:17.096
You earned it.

55:17.139 --> 55:18.619
Yeah.

55:39.510 --> 55:41.599
No fly zone starts right
there, Main and 5th.

55:41.642 --> 55:43.470
Then that's where we should go.

55:45.951 --> 55:47.169
This whole thing's going down

55:47.213 --> 55:48.823
right in the middle
of Lincoln City.

55:48.867 --> 55:51.957
Because of the towers, drones
are restricted from downtown.

55:52.000 --> 55:54.351
That means we do this quietly.

55:54.394 --> 55:56.440
The longer it stays that
way, the longer we have,

55:56.483 --> 55:58.485
so nobody pop off.

55:58.529 --> 55:59.791
Truck comes down this street.

55:59.834 --> 56:02.141
We can't do it here,
way too many cameras.

56:02.184 --> 56:03.838
Main Street's gonna be worse.

56:03.882 --> 56:06.319
What if we send it
down there?

56:06.363 --> 56:07.364
When it's at the cutoff,

56:07.407 --> 56:08.843
we're gonna put
Connor in the alley.

56:08.887 --> 56:10.454
We secure the area.

56:10.497 --> 56:12.325
Anyone calls in an attack,
restrictions get lifted,

56:12.369 --> 56:14.414
and they'll be on us in seconds.

56:14.458 --> 56:16.416
We take down the Guardians
and we round up the cops.

56:16.460 --> 56:18.418
Okay, we tie them
up, we get the Psyke,

56:18.462 --> 56:19.463
we get out, we
don't kill anyone.

56:19.506 --> 56:20.464
It's different
this time, Connor.

56:20.507 --> 56:21.595
CONNOR: It doesn't matter.

56:21.639 --> 56:23.336
Nobody has to die.

56:23.380 --> 56:24.903
This truck has four
Guardians on it.

56:24.946 --> 56:27.384
It has 10 times the surge
protection of a drone.

56:28.646 --> 56:31.475
Only way that we make it
work is if we get you close,

56:31.518 --> 56:33.520
you have one shot.

56:33.564 --> 56:35.435
You hit it, and we
have the window.

56:35.479 --> 56:36.828
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I
know he's classified,

56:36.871 --> 56:38.699
but he's still
only one Electric.

56:38.743 --> 56:40.484
What's the plan if the
fucking kid misses?

56:40.527 --> 56:41.572
I won't.

56:43.487 --> 56:44.966
He won't.

56:46.620 --> 56:49.623
Guess we're gonna see how
badly he wants to save his mom.

57:00.373 --> 57:02.854
Shit, don't fucking touch me!

57:03.811 --> 57:04.986
Back in a sec.

57:13.299 --> 57:14.779
Hey, can we talk?

57:16.563 --> 57:17.738
Wait, wait wait.

57:17.782 --> 57:19.305
Nia.

57:19.348 --> 57:22.874
You heal my mom, you can go.

57:22.917 --> 57:24.571
I'm not bringing you back here.

57:24.615 --> 57:27.661
The only reason I matter to
you is because I'm a Healer.

57:27.705 --> 57:29.358
That's all anyone
gives a fuck about

57:29.402 --> 57:30.621
once they see what I can do.

57:31.752 --> 57:33.493
Don't act like
you're any different.

58:28.592 --> 58:29.810
Looking good in
those cuffs, Mikey.

58:29.854 --> 58:32.378
MIKEY: That's what your
wife said last night.

58:32.421 --> 58:33.901
Probably.

58:36.643 --> 58:37.688
Clear.

58:39.124 --> 58:41.082
TOWER: Escort drone in
position, go when ready.

58:49.874 --> 58:51.266
They're on the move.

58:52.920 --> 58:55.575
PILOT: L to 1-1-8
and 1-0-9 in zone two,

58:55.619 --> 58:56.968
heading northbound on Main.

58:57.011 --> 58:58.491
TOWER: Copy, we see you.

59:06.412 --> 59:08.719
PILOT: Escort is half
a click to zone one.

59:08.762 --> 59:11.330
TOWER: No fly in
effect, do not enter.

59:11.373 --> 59:12.940
PILOT: Copy that.

59:17.554 --> 59:19.251
MADDY: 30 seconds.

59:20.513 --> 59:22.820
PILOT: C-1-5, now
entering zone one.

59:22.863 --> 59:24.952
TOWER: C-1-5 has
entered the no fly zone.

59:24.996 --> 59:27.041
Escort drones, move to
zone three for pickup.

59:27.085 --> 59:28.042
PILOT: Copy.

59:28.086 --> 59:30.479
See you boys on the other side.

59:30.523 --> 59:31.742
TOWER: Drones are off escort.

59:31.785 --> 59:33.744
C-1-5, you're solo
'til zone three.

59:35.267 --> 59:36.877
They're in the no fly.

59:36.921 --> 59:38.052
All right.

59:38.096 --> 59:40.402
Nobody moves until
Conner fries the truck.

59:50.717 --> 59:52.763
Ah, fuck, construction.

59:52.806 --> 59:55.200
Hang a left on 3rd,
we'll go up Liberty.

1:00:03.034 --> 1:00:04.775
TOWER: 1-5, why did you turn?

1:00:05.645 --> 1:00:06.994
COP: We hit a roadblock.

1:00:07.038 --> 1:00:09.344
We're now east
bound on 3rd street.

1:00:09.388 --> 1:00:10.389
PILOT: Copy that.

1:00:23.097 --> 1:00:24.969
MADDY: They're coming to you.

1:00:30.452 --> 1:00:32.280
COP: Whoa, whoa, what the hell.

1:00:35.806 --> 1:00:36.850
Unbelievable.

1:00:36.894 --> 1:00:38.025
TOWER: 1-5, why
have you stopped?

1:00:38.069 --> 1:00:39.940
Some idiot's blocked the road.

1:00:39.984 --> 1:00:42.029
Move your ass!

1:00:42.073 --> 1:00:43.727
Come on!

1:00:43.770 --> 1:00:46.033
PILOT: The D-1-1-8 has
arrived in zone three.

1:00:46.077 --> 1:00:47.861
Stand by for escort.

1:00:52.039 --> 1:00:53.954
COP: Move your
vehicle immediately!

1:00:53.998 --> 1:00:56.261
Hang on, one minute please!

1:00:57.262 --> 1:00:59.786
COP: Clear off the road.

1:00:59.830 --> 1:01:01.005
Yep!

1:01:01.048 --> 1:01:02.746
Come on, come on, come on.

1:01:02.789 --> 1:01:04.922
COP: Clear the road, or
you will be detained.

1:01:07.533 --> 1:01:09.013
Move, now.

1:01:12.233 --> 1:01:13.670
Fuck's he doing?

1:01:16.020 --> 1:01:18.239
This is your last warning!

1:01:21.155 --> 1:01:25.072
MADDY: What the fuck
is he waiting for?

1:01:25.116 --> 1:01:26.639
Guys --
Your vehicle.

1:01:26.683 --> 1:01:27.945
GARRETT: All right.

1:01:27.988 --> 1:01:29.294
COP: You don't move
or you will be shot.

1:01:29.337 --> 1:01:30.991
No no, no, hang on.

1:01:31.035 --> 1:01:33.428
COP: You're being detained.

1:01:46.267 --> 1:01:48.313
Code eight, I
repeat, code eight.

1:01:49.880 --> 1:01:51.316
TOWER: 1-5 just went dark,
someone get over there!

1:01:51.359 --> 1:01:53.492
PILOT: D-1-1-8, requesting
clearance of zone one.

1:01:53.535 --> 1:01:55.624
TOWER: I need ground
units in zone one.

1:01:57.104 --> 1:01:58.627
Connor!

1:02:15.383 --> 1:02:17.472
PILOT: 1-1-8 is
requesting clearance.

1:02:17.516 --> 1:02:20.519
TOWER: Stand by 1-1-8, no
fly is still in effect.

1:02:20.562 --> 1:02:22.216
How long on those ground units?

1:02:26.307 --> 1:02:30.094
1-5 under attack, 1-5
under attack, do you copy?

1:02:31.399 --> 1:02:33.445
They're burning a hole!

1:02:36.361 --> 1:02:37.928
They're coming in, get ready!

1:02:49.417 --> 1:02:51.289
MALE: Fucking move it!

1:03:01.168 --> 1:03:02.779
PILOT: Fuck this.

1:03:02.822 --> 1:03:05.390
1-1-8 is entering zone one,
path cleared to target.

1:03:05.433 --> 1:03:08.088
TOWER: 1-1-8 is into the no fly

1:03:16.488 --> 1:03:18.925
You got what you wanted, okay?

1:03:18.969 --> 1:03:20.840
Just let us go, yeah?

1:03:20.884 --> 1:03:22.233
Stay by the car.

1:03:27.194 --> 1:03:29.196
I just wanna see my
family again, okay?

1:03:29.240 --> 1:03:30.850
I just wanna see my family --

1:03:35.246 --> 1:03:36.769
Maddy!

1:04:08.583 --> 1:04:13.588
PILOT: This is the LCPD, drop
your weapons immediately.

1:04:14.415 --> 1:04:16.200
TOWER: Deploying Guardians.

1:04:22.423 --> 1:04:25.426
GARRETT: Go, come on, come on!

1:04:41.442 --> 1:04:44.358
PILOT: Four officers
down, I need medical!

1:04:44.402 --> 1:04:46.317
TOWER: All units, looking
for three powered suspects

1:04:46.360 --> 1:04:49.363
on foot between
3rd and 2nd Street.

1:04:53.280 --> 1:04:54.803
Shit.

1:04:55.326 --> 1:04:57.806
Get in the car, get
in the fucking car.

1:05:02.550 --> 1:05:03.900
Okay, come on.

1:05:05.510 --> 1:05:06.990
PILOT: 1-0-6 is southbound
on 2nd Street,

1:05:07.033 --> 1:05:07.991
no sign of suspects.

1:05:08.034 --> 1:05:09.296
Garrett, where am I going?

1:05:09.340 --> 1:05:11.298
Hey, hey, look at
me, look at me,

1:05:11.342 --> 1:05:12.778
you're gonna be
okay, just hold on.

1:05:12.821 --> 1:05:14.084
He needs a hospital, man.

1:05:14.127 --> 1:05:15.955
I fucking know that
he needs a hospital.

1:05:17.000 --> 1:05:17.957
You gotta go to the hospital.

1:05:18.001 --> 1:05:19.263
You are gonna bleed out.

1:05:20.438 --> 1:05:22.962
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

1:05:42.112 --> 1:05:43.635
Oh!

1:05:44.810 --> 1:05:47.900
Oh, it's so thick, look at that.

1:05:47.944 --> 1:05:49.815
Where are the others?

1:06:01.696 --> 1:06:03.176
Mm.

1:06:07.267 --> 1:06:09.356
I have a present for you.

1:06:11.619 --> 1:06:12.664
Like it?

1:06:14.405 --> 1:06:15.928
Hm?

1:06:16.146 --> 1:06:17.669
Yeah?

1:06:20.759 --> 1:06:24.197
Your daddy still owes
me a lot of money,

1:06:24.241 --> 1:06:26.983
but maybe I should just
have someone cut him open

1:06:27.026 --> 1:06:28.941
and we'll call it even.

1:06:36.209 --> 1:06:37.558
Start cutting that out.

1:07:35.877 --> 1:07:38.967
What the fuck just happened?

1:07:39.011 --> 1:07:44.016
Fuck!

1:07:45.148 --> 1:07:46.932
Marcus fucked us.

1:07:46.975 --> 1:07:48.673
No.

1:07:48.716 --> 1:07:49.674
No, you fucked us.

1:07:49.717 --> 1:07:51.893
That's bullshit.

1:07:51.937 --> 1:07:54.809
This was your plan, do not
fucking put this on me.

1:07:54.853 --> 1:07:57.682
The plan was fine
until you got greedy.

1:08:00.815 --> 1:08:02.948
He fucking played you, Garrett.

1:08:05.211 --> 1:08:06.995
Now we have nothing.

1:08:10.738 --> 1:08:12.218
Where you going?

1:08:17.919 --> 1:08:19.443
I've been tracking
this one Electric

1:08:19.486 --> 1:08:20.705
across multiple crimes,

1:08:20.748 --> 1:08:23.011
he's the only one
who's powerful enough

1:08:23.055 --> 1:08:25.884
and desperate enough to pull
something like this off.

1:08:25.927 --> 1:08:27.712
Reed is just the pawn.

1:08:27.755 --> 1:08:29.627
CAPTAIN: What makes you so sure?

1:08:29.670 --> 1:08:31.107
We interviewed him.

1:08:31.150 --> 1:08:32.847
He's not a killer.

1:08:32.891 --> 1:08:34.849
You had this
Electric in custody?

1:08:34.893 --> 1:08:36.895
Why didn't you charge him?

1:08:36.938 --> 1:08:38.505
Because what you know
and what you can prove

1:08:38.549 --> 1:08:40.986
are two different things,
sir, so I let him go.

1:08:41.029 --> 1:08:42.814
And then what happened?

1:08:42.857 --> 1:08:44.903
Look at the fucking board.

1:08:44.946 --> 1:08:46.513
That enough evidence for you?

1:08:49.081 --> 1:08:50.082
None of this gets out.

1:08:51.692 --> 1:08:53.651
This goes south and it's
your heads on the block,

1:08:53.694 --> 1:08:55.522
I will make goddamn
sure of that.

1:08:57.220 --> 1:09:00.048
Now find the bastards
that did this.

1:09:05.576 --> 1:09:07.230
Where's that line of yours now?

1:09:20.591 --> 1:09:21.548
CONNOR: Hi.

1:09:21.592 --> 1:09:22.593
Hi.

1:09:26.074 --> 1:09:27.902
Mom, I'm so sorry.

1:09:37.869 --> 1:09:39.218
Where were you?

1:09:42.178 --> 1:09:43.657
I...

1:09:44.484 --> 1:09:46.269
I was just figuring
some things out.

1:09:49.097 --> 1:09:53.885
You're gonna be okay,
okay, I can fix this.

1:09:53.928 --> 1:09:55.408
Connor.

1:09:56.757 --> 1:09:58.019
You have to stop.

1:09:59.412 --> 1:10:01.066
No.

1:10:01.109 --> 1:10:03.721
No, there is a way, okay?

1:10:03.764 --> 1:10:05.636
You just need to trust me.

1:10:08.029 --> 1:10:10.031
You need to let me go.

1:10:11.163 --> 1:10:12.643
I can't do that.

1:10:40.148 --> 1:10:41.628
RADIO: Women in uniform.

1:10:41.672 --> 1:10:44.065
So when we talk about
imposing a complete power ban,

1:10:44.109 --> 1:10:45.850
we're talking about a
public safety issue.

1:10:45.893 --> 1:10:47.547
WOMAN: How will that stop
criminals from using them?

1:10:47.591 --> 1:10:49.114
They don't care about the law.

1:10:49.157 --> 1:10:51.072
A ban affects innocent
people with power, that's it.

1:10:51.116 --> 1:10:52.073
MAN: Fact is --

1:11:01.257 --> 1:11:03.215
Lina, your father's here.

1:11:03.259 --> 1:11:04.303
LINA: Coming!

1:11:07.828 --> 1:11:09.743
She was a real handful today.

1:11:11.005 --> 1:11:14.139
Stuff falling off the
walls and the counter.

1:11:14.182 --> 1:11:16.533
The kids at school
are scared of her.

1:11:16.576 --> 1:11:17.751
LINA: Hi, Dad!

1:11:17.795 --> 1:11:19.275
Hey, sweetie.

1:11:21.625 --> 1:11:23.279
We'll talk about
this later, okay?

1:11:30.938 --> 1:11:32.113
How's the cotton candy?

1:11:34.246 --> 1:11:35.334
What's wrong, sweetie?

1:11:37.075 --> 1:11:39.382
Are you and mom
gonna give me away?

1:11:43.386 --> 1:11:45.344
What makes you think that?

1:11:45.388 --> 1:11:48.129
I know some parents do that
when their kid is like me.

1:11:49.914 --> 1:11:51.742
PARK: Who told you that?

1:11:51.785 --> 1:11:53.134
I heard it on the news.

1:11:59.402 --> 1:12:00.925
Hey!

1:12:01.317 --> 1:12:02.796
You Officer Park?

1:12:04.537 --> 1:12:06.496
Please, just take it.

1:12:11.283 --> 1:12:13.329
LINA: Daddy, who was that?

1:12:13.372 --> 1:12:15.461
He's just a friend,
sweetie, come on.

1:12:25.819 --> 1:12:30.824

I'll never let you go ♪

PARK: It's a little too
late for a deal, Connor.

1:12:58.635 --> 1:13:00.158
You oughta bring yourself in.

1:13:00.201 --> 1:13:01.855
Once this is finished.

1:13:01.899 --> 1:13:03.204
I'm not asking you.

1:13:03.248 --> 1:13:04.467
If you don't move now,
the Psyke will be gone,

1:13:04.510 --> 1:13:06.033
and so will Sutcliffe.

1:13:06.077 --> 1:13:09.123
Four cops are dead.

♪ I love you, I do,
pretend you love me too ♪

1:13:19.046 --> 1:13:22.528
You know, maybe your
partner was right.

1:13:23.442 --> 1:13:25.575
I am just another
criminal like my father.

1:13:28.926 --> 1:13:31.189
He paid for what he
did and so will I,

1:13:31.232 --> 1:13:35.759
but my mom is the only good
thing I've ever had in my life.

1:13:40.546 --> 1:13:41.939
I can give you Sutcliffe,

1:13:41.982 --> 1:13:43.114
but if that's not
good enough for you

1:13:43.157 --> 1:13:45.508
then just fucking shoot me.

1:13:45.551 --> 1:13:48.424
If I lose her I got
nothing left anyways.

1:14:04.222 --> 1:14:05.745
TOWER: Surveillance
drones in zone 11

1:14:05.789 --> 1:14:07.660
cleared to 500 feet.

1:14:07.704 --> 1:14:10.489
PILOT: 1-0-9 are in position.

1:14:10.533 --> 1:14:12.317
We have eyes on location.

1:14:12.360 --> 1:14:14.362
Multiple bogies spotted
by the entrance.

1:14:18.105 --> 1:14:20.499
CAPTAIN: D-1-0-9, punch in.

1:14:20.543 --> 1:14:22.501
PILOT: Psyke runners have
been going in and out all day,

1:14:22.545 --> 1:14:24.721
no sign of Sutcliffe yet.

1:14:29.552 --> 1:14:30.640
Call it in!

1:14:33.817 --> 1:14:36.167
Better be right about this.

1:14:47.787 --> 1:14:50.486
MAN: Let's get these fucks!

1:14:52.183 --> 1:14:55.229
PILOT: 1-0-8 to tower
two, taking off.

1:14:55.273 --> 1:14:56.883
TOWER: Tower two, you're clear.

1:14:58.102 --> 1:15:01.497
1-0-8's in the sky, ground
units on the move.

Nia!

Do it.

1:15:40.536 --> 1:15:42.668

Guardians, coming in.

1:19:15.098 --> 1:19:16.186
Fuck you.

1:19:43.517 --> 1:19:47.304
You just heal my mom

1:19:47.347 --> 1:19:49.393
Connor, it's not that simple.

1:19:49.436 --> 1:19:50.916
Why not?

1:20:10.283 --> 1:20:11.328
Hey.

1:20:31.522 --> 1:20:32.828
NIA: Please.

1:20:33.611 --> 1:20:35.134
It could kill me.

1:21:30.015 --> 1:21:31.538
Save her.

1:21:59.436 --> 1:22:01.003
She's beautiful.

1:23:08.940 --> 1:23:10.724
Stop, stop, stop.

1:23:16.774 --> 1:23:17.818
Stop.

1:23:28.525 --> 1:23:29.700
Connor.

1:23:29.743 --> 1:23:30.788
Hey.

1:23:31.615 --> 1:23:32.833
Hey, I'm here.

1:23:34.052 --> 1:23:35.532
I'm here.

1:24:59.268 --> 1:25:03.446
There's, uh,

1:25:03.489 --> 1:25:04.838
almost a full tank.

1:25:05.796 --> 1:25:07.841
It should help you get
wherever you need to go.

1:25:19.636 --> 1:25:22.204
I'm sorry for what I did to you.

1:25:35.782 --> 1:25:37.088
What about you?

1:25:40.483 --> 1:25:42.006
I'm...

1:25:44.878 --> 1:25:49.883
I'm just gonna go in there,
see how to make things right.

1:26:08.902 --> 1:26:10.165
For the first time,

1:26:10.208 --> 1:26:12.036
City Hall will vote on
an outright power ban

1:26:12.079 --> 1:26:13.211
in Lincoln City.

1:26:13.255 --> 1:26:14.908
Proponents have pushed
through the bill

1:26:14.952 --> 1:26:16.910
since four officers were killed

1:26:16.954 --> 1:26:19.086
five weeks ago while
transporting Psyke.

1:26:23.700 --> 1:26:24.744
Smile, Park.

1:26:26.572 --> 1:26:28.487
Thanks to these brave officers,

1:26:28.531 --> 1:26:32.143
who tirelessly put in
good, honest police work,

1:26:32.187 --> 1:26:35.015
our streets are cleaner and
safer than they've ever been.

1:26:49.204 --> 1:26:52.119
That's double what Marcus owed.

1:26:52.163 --> 1:26:54.078
The Trust appreciates
your generosity.

1:26:54.121 --> 1:26:55.862
There's still
business to be done.

1:26:56.820 --> 1:26:58.125
The cops are leaning on us now,

1:26:58.169 --> 1:27:00.302
but demand for Psyke
is higher than ever.

1:27:00.345 --> 1:27:01.868
Hmm.

1:27:03.043 --> 1:27:04.784
I'll find out if
they're interested.

1:27:05.742 --> 1:27:07.222
Okay.

1:27:27.764 --> 1:27:29.244
Hey, Mom.

1:27:30.767 --> 1:27:35.206
May not be able to
visit for a while,

1:27:35.250 --> 1:27:38.949
but I know you'll be
checking in on me, so,

1:27:41.256 --> 1:27:46.261
if you see me drifting, just
give me a little nudge, okay?

1:27:47.392 --> 1:27:48.785
Promise I won't freak out.

1:27:56.619 --> 1:27:58.142
Love you.
