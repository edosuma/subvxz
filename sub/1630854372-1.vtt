00:05.120 --> 00:09.515
Based on a true story.

00:09.599 --> 00:15.279
Those events depicted,
which seem most unbelievable...

00:15.960 --> 00:20.795
...are mostly true.

00:20.879 --> 00:25.359
MAY 1941 Somewhere in the Egyptian Desert

01:57.879 --> 02:01.439
My truck is running low on fuel
so the rest must be the same.

02:02.120 --> 02:04.519
Permission to bring up the fuel trucks.

02:07.400 --> 02:11.319
Tobruk is a hundred and twenty miles,
we need to refuel.

02:12.560 --> 02:15.039
Yes, I know.

02:15.960 --> 02:20.000
Right. So you should give the order
to bring up...

02:24.159 --> 02:25.960
Please tell me

02:26.919 --> 02:31.319
that we brought petrol
trucks with us on this convoy?

02:36.879 --> 02:39.199
As a matter of fact, we didn't.

02:40.039 --> 02:44.520
I've been watching my own fuel gauge
moving inexorably toward empty

02:45.159 --> 02:47.759
and I've worked out that what it must be,

02:48.879 --> 02:52.879
is that the convoy has been fuelled
with just enough petrol

02:53.439 --> 02:56.240
for a journey of 500 kilometres.

02:58.080 --> 03:04.560
Right, but the journey from Cairo
to Tobruk is 500 miles, old boy.

03:06.280 --> 03:07.719
Indeed.

03:09.000 --> 03:13.680
There are Frenchman
in the transport department.

03:14.840 --> 03:17.280
Frenchman. Right. That'll be it.

03:23.680 --> 03:27.555
So we will not reach Tobruk and the
siege of Tobruk will not be relieved

03:27.639 --> 03:29.476
and the bombs and the shells
will continue to fall

03:29.560 --> 03:31.479
and hundreds more men will die.

03:33.400 --> 03:34.759
Yes.

03:36.120 --> 03:37.876
And Stirling,
I don't care who your father was,

03:37.960 --> 03:40.319
you are supposed to address me as Sir.

03:51.680 --> 03:53.120
Piss off.

04:06.840 --> 04:09.960
ROGUE HEROES

04:11.879 --> 04:14.756
In spring 1941 Britain
and the Colonial armies

04:14.840 --> 04:18.079
stood against Nazi Germany
and Fascist Italy.

04:20.240 --> 04:22.716
Britain was clinging on in North Africa

04:22.800 --> 04:26.600
defending its vital supply route
of the Suez Canal.

04:32.439 --> 04:36.995
As the Nazis advanced,
the Allied armies fell back on Tobruk,

04:37.079 --> 04:40.720
a crucial port they had to defend
at all costs.

04:41.680 --> 04:45.600
If Tobruck fell, Suez would be lost.

04:46.600 --> 04:50.240
If Suez was lost, Africa would be lost.

04:51.040 --> 04:54.079
If Africa was lost, the war would be lost.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.115
In the words of Winston Churchill,

04:57.199 --> 05:01.195
the whole English-speaking world was
passing through a dark and deadly valley.

05:01.279 --> 05:03.396
In the words of the common soldier...

05:03.480 --> 05:05.240
...we were fucked.

05:30.240 --> 05:33.519
There will be another fuck up
by GHQ tomorrow.

06:04.160 --> 06:06.120
Yes, whisky.

06:07.040 --> 06:10.920
I won. I won,
I won on a horse called Smoky.

06:12.519 --> 06:15.519
Girls didn't make it tonight
because of the rain.

06:17.120 --> 06:20.199
Invite him to feel regret,
he felt no regret.

06:20.600 --> 06:23.120
I like you, d'you know why?

06:24.279 --> 06:26.315
Because if I tell you a joke,
you pretend that it's funny.

06:26.399 --> 06:30.680
So here goes, why did the chicken
not reach the end of the road?

06:31.160 --> 06:36.235
Because it was a chicken who had
volunteered for the Commandos,

06:36.319 --> 06:38.235
the British Commando Regiment

06:38.319 --> 06:42.435
and so the order came down from GHQ
for the chicken to set off down the road.

06:42.519 --> 06:46.596
Fucking road. And so the chicken
packed up his equipment,

06:46.680 --> 06:49.836
wanked off his reckless urges,
prayed to God, got in his vehicle,

06:49.920 --> 06:53.279
set off down the road
and then there ahead, right ahead

06:53.720 --> 06:58.600
at exactly 120 miles outside of Tobruk

07:01.360 --> 07:05.240
was the punchline of this very,
very funny joke.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.639
What's punchline?

07:10.360 --> 07:12.800
It's a British military secret.

07:19.040 --> 07:22.160
So we are stood down, again,

07:24.199 --> 07:27.079
so the chicken stays in Cairo,
goes to the races,

07:27.439 --> 07:31.240
it rains, and the girls didn't make it.
And you know something?

07:31.879 --> 07:35.399
- You hate this place.
- I hate this peace.

07:38.120 --> 07:43.519
War, my friend, is where you find it.
Come on.

07:47.439 --> 07:49.600
Bottle of Arak and two glasses.

07:55.600 --> 07:56.759
Ah, pom.

08:01.519 --> 08:06.319
Hey Pom, do any of you Poms
ever leave fucking Cairo?

08:07.800 --> 08:10.115
Any of you Brits even seen
an Italian yet?

08:10.199 --> 08:13.279
Australians. I love Australia.

08:14.439 --> 08:18.879
Wildlife and fauna,
designed by a lunatic.

08:19.319 --> 08:20.240
Fuck you.

08:25.519 --> 08:26.836
GHADZI BRITISH MILITARY PRISON

08:26.920 --> 08:28.516
CAIRO SAME NIGHT

08:28.600 --> 08:33.116
If the heats of hate and lust
in the house of flesh are strong,

08:33.200 --> 08:37.480
let me mind the house of dust
where my sojourn shall be long.

08:37.840 --> 08:41.360
In the nation that is not,
nothing stands that stood before,

08:41.720 --> 08:45.720
there revenges are forgot
and the hater hates no more.

08:46.519 --> 08:51.240
And naked to the hangman's noose
the morning clocks will ring.

09:15.240 --> 09:17.039
How's your colleague?

09:19.679 --> 09:21.960
I hope I did no permanent damage.

09:23.960 --> 09:25.315
Irish fucker.

09:25.399 --> 09:29.960
Fucker, first and foremost,
Irish is a contributing factor perhaps,

09:30.360 --> 09:34.679
but in other times
I am a friend to the friendless.

09:35.879 --> 09:39.756
Your colleague was being unpleasant
to a smaller man, and it got my goat.

09:39.840 --> 09:42.600
Well we are about
to be unpleasant to you.

09:42.960 --> 09:46.036
You won't be using military policeman
as a punch bag anymore.

09:46.120 --> 09:47.480
You're a mental case.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.519
No one'll be surprised
to find you dangling in the morning.

09:51.840 --> 09:54.039
And yon the gallows clank.

09:57.080 --> 10:02.440
Well if you want me to walk on air, yous
are gonna have to find Naked Nick first,

10:04.799 --> 10:11.000
'cause I'm used to uneven battles boys,
so begin your search.

10:17.919 --> 10:22.835
Desert sores, dysentery,
sand in your arse, sand in your eyes,

10:22.919 --> 10:26.879
sand in your lungs, sand in your kidneys,
sand in your foreskin,

10:27.399 --> 10:30.720
all be forgotten when the blood is up.

10:31.879 --> 10:33.279
Take it.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.919
Now, take a drink of rum.

10:40.720 --> 10:42.639
Drink, do not think.

10:43.720 --> 10:45.639
Do not be yourself tonight.

10:47.519 --> 10:53.080
Remember this, when we are among
them, your mother is not watching.

10:55.799 --> 10:57.279
Let's move.

11:23.759 --> 11:28.759
10 seconds, then mad. Wild.

11:36.320 --> 11:39.879
- You even seen action?
- Repeatedly stood down I'm afraid.

11:41.360 --> 11:44.195
- Now we've seen action.
- I'm sensing resentment.

11:44.279 --> 11:46.715
- You fucking arsehole.
- And I understand it.

11:46.799 --> 11:51.795
When one has faced danger, oh it takes
a long time to lose the animal rage.

11:51.879 --> 11:53.595
Talks like a fucking typewriter.

11:53.679 --> 11:57.475
The rain always does this to people.
Why don't you leave him alone, huh?

11:57.559 --> 11:58.679
Yeah?

11:59.559 --> 12:01.000
We lost two good men.

12:05.720 --> 12:07.159
Theft.

12:08.279 --> 12:11.276
I'm afraid theft is something
I cannot tolerate,

12:11.360 --> 12:17.156
but if we are going to engage,
first let me give you a small warning,

12:17.240 --> 12:19.799
I am a particular kind of soldier.

12:20.159 --> 12:22.996
A commando. I trained
with other men like myself,

12:23.080 --> 12:26.356
some live only to fight
and kill the enemy,

12:26.440 --> 12:30.559
others are careless you will find
and will fight anyone at all.

12:30.879 --> 12:32.879
There are mercifully few of us,

12:33.200 --> 12:37.480
but in war, we are allowed
to be beasts that we are.

12:40.360 --> 12:42.195
We are taught to kill silently

12:42.279 --> 12:44.876
and it becomes instinctive
almost like swallowing,

12:44.960 --> 12:48.759
and the cursed thing is, once learned,
you can't unlearn it.

12:50.159 --> 12:51.559
Do you understand?

12:54.360 --> 12:58.919
You shake hands with a man and you
can't help but glance at his throat.

13:00.080 --> 13:01.360
Every part of the body

13:02.080 --> 13:06.759
is an invitation to be eagerly accepted
as a dog accepts a bone.

13:08.360 --> 13:13.120
Eyes are for thumbs
to push into the brain.

13:14.000 --> 13:17.559
Mouths can be torn open.
Necks are a gift.

13:18.600 --> 13:20.279
God's ultimate mistake.

13:21.600 --> 13:26.475
Spoons, tea towels, cups of tea,
they are all weapons.

13:26.559 --> 13:32.080
Everything you touch is a weapon.
You are a weapon.

13:33.480 --> 13:37.200
If our gentlemen generals
had the sense to unleash us,

13:39.840 --> 13:41.759
can you even imagine?

13:47.279 --> 13:50.955
Ordinary men when they encounter us

13:51.039 --> 13:56.435
are understandably reluctant
to make our acquaintance

13:56.519 --> 13:58.720
but if you really do insist...

14:14.360 --> 14:15.919
Not my stop boys.

14:17.480 --> 14:19.039
Not my fucking stop.

14:19.639 --> 14:21.039
Not today.

14:32.879 --> 14:35.519
Yeah, we're just here for the girls.

14:43.279 --> 14:44.919
My winnings.

14:53.279 --> 14:57.559
Buy yourselves a drink,
raise a toast to fallen comrades.

15:07.360 --> 15:10.636
Instead of spending a fucking year
in Scotland climbing mountains,

15:10.720 --> 15:12.879
sleeping in ditches and strangling cattle,

15:13.200 --> 15:17.240
I should've just memorised that speech
because it works every time.

15:18.679 --> 15:20.639
Get me a whiskey old boy.

15:25.120 --> 15:26.320
To whiskey.

16:03.960 --> 16:05.399
Morning, Sir.

16:09.600 --> 16:10.919
Sir.

16:14.200 --> 16:16.559
Morning, Sir.

16:17.080 --> 16:19.960
- Someone fix that fucking thing.
- Morning, Sir.

16:24.919 --> 16:27.639
Doesn't this fucking squeaking
drive you insane?

16:30.399 --> 16:31.720
Fix the fucking thing.

16:32.720 --> 16:34.399
- Sir.
- Morning, Sir.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.279
Morning, Sir.

17:04.480 --> 17:06.079
There's a bit of a thing,

17:06.440 --> 17:11.079
drinks etcetera,
nibbles and whatnot tonight at the...

17:13.559 --> 17:15.839
- At the what?
- At the embassy.

17:16.599 --> 17:20.240
A sort of farewell thing for someone,
some old boy going home.

17:20.799 --> 17:22.359
A chance for everyone to...

17:22.680 --> 17:27.000
A chance for everyone to formulate
a plan for our next assault in Tobruk.

17:27.960 --> 17:29.035
What?

17:29.119 --> 17:33.400
A chance for everyone to say goodbye
and good luck to him, whoever he is.

17:34.319 --> 17:39.160
- And you'll be there, Stirling.
- Tobruk is under 24 hour bombardment.

17:40.519 --> 17:43.116
A second attempt to relieve Tobruk
is being discussed.

17:43.200 --> 17:45.880
- Actually it'll be a third attempt.
- Indeed.

17:52.039 --> 17:57.039
The fans don't work.
I can't fucking salute anymore.

17:57.640 --> 18:02.839
The map on the wall keeps
being redrawn and men are dying.

18:03.839 --> 18:06.920
Stirling, what would it take
to make you call me Sir?

18:08.400 --> 18:10.519
It would take respect.

18:10.839 --> 18:14.755
Stirling, you are not the soldier
your father was and you never will be.

18:14.839 --> 18:16.916
You're the kind of drunk
and insubordinate malcontent

18:17.000 --> 18:18.279
he would've despised.

18:18.640 --> 18:21.396
You will come to the party,
you will arrive sober and on time

18:21.480 --> 18:24.000
or you, my friend, will be on a charge.

18:44.200 --> 18:48.920
Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

18:49.759 --> 18:54.680
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done
on Earth as it is in heaven.

18:55.640 --> 18:59.599
Give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses

18:59.960 --> 19:02.836
as we forgive those
who trespass against us

19:02.920 --> 19:07.000
and lead us not into temptation
but deliver us from evil.

19:07.559 --> 19:13.440
For thine is the kingdom, the power
and the glory forever and ever... Amen.

19:27.440 --> 19:30.240
Troops. Attention!

19:38.200 --> 19:42.440
Last night we dispatched
50 enemy soldiers

19:43.079 --> 19:45.839
and destroyed one key gun emplacement.

19:48.480 --> 19:50.359
We had only one casualty,

19:51.440 --> 19:53.359
Matthews died in the night.

20:03.079 --> 20:04.356
Did you sleep well?

20:04.440 --> 20:09.359
I was a disaster with the work we did,
Sir, but satisfied with our achievement.

20:11.079 --> 20:12.680
I slept on my boots.

20:14.279 --> 20:15.960
I always sleep well, Sir.

20:24.519 --> 20:27.759
We've spent 112 days
defending this place,

20:29.319 --> 20:32.240
amidst the rats and the scorpions
and the flies.

20:34.000 --> 20:37.039
We must continue and show fortitude.

20:52.440 --> 20:55.880
Command are sending another convoy
to relieve us.

20:56.759 --> 20:59.960
Our beloved friends at GHQ
might this time remember

21:00.359 --> 21:03.759
to fill the armoured cars
with enough petrol in the tanks

21:04.279 --> 21:06.160
to reach the destination.

21:07.160 --> 21:09.240
They can be quite forgetful.

21:14.759 --> 21:16.400
In the meantime,

21:17.160 --> 21:21.000
tonight I will be taking
a flight to Cairo on urgent business.

21:21.519 --> 21:27.039
If GHQ can't relieve us, I'm formulating a
plan that might get us out of this mess.

21:36.119 --> 21:37.640
Move out the way.

21:39.279 --> 21:40.799
Move.

21:42.920 --> 21:47.079
Move those fucking camels.
Get out the way.

22:24.880 --> 22:28.275
Sir, permission to steal donated food
rations from the Australians.

22:28.359 --> 22:29.880
Permission granted.

22:33.680 --> 22:35.880
So what is it we're looking for, Sir?

22:36.440 --> 22:40.400
I got a message from one of the dock
workers who I bribe with Hashish.

22:41.160 --> 22:44.960
I asked him to keep an eye out

22:45.599 --> 22:49.319
in the swirling chaos of equipment
and supplies for parachutes.

22:49.759 --> 22:51.079
And lo,

22:53.240 --> 22:55.400
a set of parachutes have appeared.

22:56.519 --> 22:59.279
And who do they belong to, Sir?

23:01.519 --> 23:03.119
This is the British army.

23:03.559 --> 23:06.195
No one owns anything,
no one knows anything,

23:06.279 --> 23:08.799
nothing is certain,
nothing is as it seems,

23:09.240 --> 23:12.920
so whatever the fuck you have
in your hands belongs to you.

23:13.480 --> 23:15.955
And what use do you have
for parachutes, Sir?

23:16.039 --> 23:18.799
I'm going to jump out of aeroplanes
with them.

23:21.960 --> 23:26.079
- And do you know parachutes, Sir?
- Do you know parachutes...

23:26.960 --> 23:30.240
I know you strap them to your back,
you jump,

23:31.400 --> 23:33.319
the thing becomes enormous

23:35.519 --> 23:37.160
and you land safely.

23:39.400 --> 23:43.079
Catch the damn thing before it blows
into the sea, Almonds.

23:45.400 --> 23:46.759
Put it back in.

23:48.039 --> 23:50.680
- How, Sir?
- How the hell should I know?

23:51.400 --> 23:54.599
I think it's meant to be
a very precise procedure.

23:55.319 --> 23:58.195
Then be precise
and have them all loaded onto a truck

23:58.279 --> 24:01.319
and sent to the airstrip
for tonight's flight.

24:06.240 --> 24:10.200
And you will be on that flight
as well Sergeant, along with Riley.

24:11.160 --> 24:13.680
I've decided you are
the right kind of men.

24:15.960 --> 24:17.510
The right kind of men for what?

24:18.240 --> 24:24.039
In a world where there are no rules,
no order and no organised plan,

24:25.200 --> 24:29.680
certain men are identified
by war itself as its natural executors

24:31.599 --> 24:35.359
and those natural executors
take matters into their own hands.

24:36.880 --> 24:39.559
I've decided to form
a parachute regiment.

24:40.799 --> 24:42.079
You've decided?

24:43.839 --> 24:46.435
Our generals still think
we are fighting the first world war.

24:46.519 --> 24:49.156
They dither and debate every order

24:49.240 --> 24:52.396
and all this while the
Nazi's whose conviction

24:52.480 --> 24:55.279
cuts through us like fucking steel blades.

24:59.319 --> 25:03.200
We are chased across the fucking desert.
A comedy.

25:04.400 --> 25:06.836
Except for the viciousness
of their ideology.

25:06.920 --> 25:08.675
Riley. Right, lets load 'em up.

25:08.759 --> 25:11.396
Do you know what they're doing
to the children in Berlin?

25:11.480 --> 25:15.799
The devil sent me those tins of beef,
God sent me those parachutes

25:16.200 --> 25:18.316
and I'm going to give it a whirl.

25:18.400 --> 25:23.000
I am bringing together men of a particular
calibre and you are amongst them.

25:23.839 --> 25:27.440
The others are all insane,
in jail or like me in despair.

25:31.839 --> 25:34.000
Let's go and win the fucking war.

26:31.279 --> 26:32.559
Hangover?

26:33.960 --> 26:36.519
Justified by inner rage.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.279
What do you need?

26:43.599 --> 26:46.720
A medical reason not to attend
a fucking cocktail party

26:47.319 --> 26:50.035
and while you're at it,
get me out of drill for a few days.

26:50.119 --> 26:53.475
You can't rationalise drill
because it is meant to make you accept

26:53.559 --> 26:55.920
that the meaningless is important.

26:57.119 --> 26:59.035
Last night there was an officer
looking for you.

26:59.119 --> 27:03.475
He wanted to know if the dysentery you
reported two weeks ago was genuine.

27:03.559 --> 27:04.556
They think you are malingering.

27:04.640 --> 27:07.116
It's not me that's fucking malingering,
it's GHQ.

27:07.200 --> 27:09.556
Layer upon layer of fossilised shit.

27:09.640 --> 27:14.440
- A freemasonry of mediocrity.
- Yeah, they're onto you. Court Martial.

27:15.319 --> 27:18.480
- Invented illnesses.
- Are you lying?

27:19.319 --> 27:20.640
Of course.

27:22.720 --> 27:25.359
So what did he actually ask you about?

27:26.319 --> 27:28.715
I'd been at the dope
so it's all a bit unclear.

27:28.799 --> 27:32.116
He had a message from
a Lieutenant Jack Lewes in Tobruk.

27:32.200 --> 27:33.880
- Jock Lewes.
- Whatever.

27:34.200 --> 27:35.836
Dear god, you are through the roof.

27:35.920 --> 27:41.319
Whiskey, bang, bang, bang, one after
the other. Memories of Scotland.

27:42.640 --> 27:48.000
You know how a bear in a cage sort of
stands there and sways from side to side.

27:57.319 --> 27:59.839
So what did Jock Lewes say?

28:01.319 --> 28:04.675
Here. Go to the Empire Club tonight,
meet Paddy Mayne

28:04.759 --> 28:08.876
and bring him to the Tipperary Club
for a reunion of the three musketeers.

28:08.960 --> 28:13.319
- What the fuck does that say?
- It just, just says parachutes.

28:23.960 --> 28:28.240
11 COMMANDO CAMP HELIOPOLIS, CAIRO

28:33.480 --> 28:35.160
Get up you boy ya.

28:36.839 --> 28:39.400
The dead arose and appeared to many.

28:41.519 --> 28:44.079
- Welcome home.
- No.

28:48.480 --> 28:51.240
- Were you arrested?
- Detained.

28:53.839 --> 28:55.755
Were you identified?

28:55.839 --> 29:00.636
Nope. I said my name
was Mr. Hyde and I had no papers.

29:00.720 --> 29:04.480
They gave me a 10 shilling fine
for not having identification.

29:04.960 --> 29:07.599
They were gonna hang me
as a matter of fact.

29:08.480 --> 29:12.240
- For have for having no ID?
- No, for seeking justice.

29:12.839 --> 29:16.640
- What is this soup?
- It's the gazelle you shot.

29:20.039 --> 29:21.519
It's very nice.

29:23.480 --> 29:24.720
Thank you.

29:28.480 --> 29:31.880
You know, eventually, of course,

29:34.400 --> 29:36.839
you are going to get yourself hung.

29:39.680 --> 29:42.079
They say it is an exquisite death.

29:42.480 --> 29:46.359
Although, who the people
are that know that is unrecorded.

29:48.880 --> 29:52.119
You're supposed to be in hospital.
Why did you leave?

29:53.480 --> 29:57.599
I don't so much have Malaria anymore
as much as share a bed with it.

29:58.400 --> 30:01.675
My only symptom now is soaking
the sheets every night.

30:01.759 --> 30:05.720
I sweat so much I'm embarrassed,
half the nurses can wring them out.

30:07.119 --> 30:09.799
So I went and sweated
in a nightclub instead

30:10.720 --> 30:15.720
and somebody got my goat
and there's no more to it than that.

30:22.559 --> 30:23.960
Last night,

30:24.920 --> 30:29.195
someone was here with a message
from a Lieutenant Jock Lewes in Tobruk.

30:29.279 --> 30:30.960
Something about parachutes.

30:31.480 --> 30:35.035
You're due at the Empire tonight
to meet a fella called Stirling

30:35.119 --> 30:37.240
to reunite the three musketeers.

30:42.559 --> 30:44.720
CAIRO EMPIRE CLUB

31:38.519 --> 31:41.279
- Working tonight, Sir?
- Not tonight, dear.

31:44.000 --> 31:48.079
No. No, no. I'm afraid not.

31:50.039 --> 31:54.876
I dunno what a red flower on the table
signifies in the language of Cairo

31:54.960 --> 31:59.515
but I'm not looking for a brief accord
if that's what you're thinking.

31:59.599 --> 32:02.440
A brief accord? You are a poet.

32:02.960 --> 32:07.160
- As a matter of fact I am.
- And I'm a journalist.

32:08.240 --> 32:10.680
And I'm a journalist, said the spy.

32:11.279 --> 32:16.076
Of course I am a spy. In war we must all
re-purpose our professional talents.

32:16.160 --> 32:18.319
- Sorry old boy.
- Fuck off.

32:23.119 --> 32:25.039
And what is your purpose?

32:25.960 --> 32:27.515
I am an intelligence officer

32:27.599 --> 32:32.356
who reports directly to the Free French
Government in Exile. General De Gaulle.

32:32.440 --> 32:35.440
From his bar stool in a pub
in Dean Street.

32:36.039 --> 32:38.559
How are you enjoying Cairo, Paddy Mayne?

32:39.240 --> 32:40.356
How d'you know my name?

32:40.440 --> 32:44.475
Lieutenant Mayne, your victory over the
Vichy French at the Litani River

32:44.559 --> 32:49.240
was the 1st piece of good news for the
French who oppose Hitler in a long time.

32:49.920 --> 32:51.275
I would like you to give me an assessment

32:51.359 --> 32:55.116
of the morale pro-Nazi French soldiers
that you came into contact with

32:55.200 --> 32:57.640
so that I can file a report
to the General.

32:58.200 --> 33:02.076
All the pro-Nazi French soldiers I
personally came into contact with

33:02.160 --> 33:03.160
are dead.

33:03.920 --> 33:08.599
So their morale is pretty poor
I would say.

33:13.640 --> 33:18.920
My father was a brigadier,
he taught me to ride, shoot and kill.

33:20.119 --> 33:22.119
Kill with cutlery if necessary.

33:22.799 --> 33:26.435
If you're in need of cutlery I'd go
and find another table.

33:26.519 --> 33:28.400
I'm here to attend a meeting.

33:31.000 --> 33:33.916
- Very well. Apologies.
- No. Fuck it, no.

33:34.000 --> 33:35.715
D'you know what, I'll go.

33:35.799 --> 33:39.356
Didn't wanna be here anyway.
I only came to politely say no.

33:39.440 --> 33:41.836
Would you wait
for him and pass on a message?

33:41.920 --> 33:42.916
Wait for who?

33:43.000 --> 33:44.955
Just tell him Paddy Mayne says no

33:45.039 --> 33:49.156
because he has decided to go to Burma
to fight the Japanese instead.

33:49.240 --> 33:52.880
It'll be a very tall man
who will be drunk or will get drunk

33:53.599 --> 33:57.799
and when you give him my message,
he might get angry so you should leave.

34:01.839 --> 34:05.200
Just tell him, Paddy Mayne says no.
Alright?

34:43.519 --> 34:47.119
I would like to introduce to you
Alina Carnett.

35:10.960 --> 35:12.960
Sorry, this table is booked.

35:14.039 --> 35:16.960
- You crept up on me.
- You'll have to go I'm afraid.

35:17.440 --> 35:19.000
I have a message for you.

35:19.920 --> 35:22.360
- A message from who?
- Paddy Mayne.

35:23.199 --> 35:24.716
He was here

35:24.800 --> 35:28.920
and he said he has decided he's going
to Burma to fight the Japanese.

35:30.800 --> 35:31.880
Right.

35:33.239 --> 35:34.960
He said you would be angry.

35:36.880 --> 35:38.199
No, I'm not.

35:39.320 --> 35:40.676
Was he sober?

35:40.760 --> 35:43.716
- I think so. But he was quite odd.
- Yes, he is.

35:43.800 --> 35:45.435
- Drink, Sir?
- Whisky.

35:45.519 --> 35:46.800
Yes, Sir.

35:49.599 --> 35:51.679
He was right, you are tall.

35:53.880 --> 35:56.079
Who the fuck are you?

35:56.760 --> 35:59.475
I'm the Deputy Head of French Military
Intelligence in Cairo.

35:59.559 --> 36:02.276
So you're the head of
French Military Intelligence in Cairo,

36:02.360 --> 36:06.159
because I know your boss
and he's always drunk.

36:07.239 --> 36:10.360
- Are you new?
- To Cairo, yes.

36:10.920 --> 36:13.480
In every other way I'm not new.

36:20.920 --> 36:25.236
Listen, in other times I would love
to stay and make conversation,

36:25.320 --> 36:28.400
but right now
beauty is not a currency I value.

36:30.719 --> 36:33.876
Apologies, that sounded like
an attempt to be charming, didn't it?

36:33.960 --> 36:37.716
- It wasn't meant to be.
- It wasn't taken as charming at all.

36:37.800 --> 36:39.480
Not even remotely.

36:40.360 --> 36:43.719
Sometimes the French and the British
misunderstand each other.

36:44.079 --> 36:47.400
It's like the difference
between kilometres and miles.

36:49.320 --> 36:51.599
The result can be unfortunate.

36:52.440 --> 36:53.796
You heard about that?

36:53.880 --> 36:57.000
You will learn that I tend to hear
about everything.

36:57.400 --> 36:58.320
Whisky.

36:58.639 --> 37:00.475
- I need a car.
- Where to, Sir?

37:00.559 --> 37:02.719
Tipperary fucking tea club.

37:12.519 --> 37:17.119
Lieutenant Stirling,
for the avoidance of doubt,

37:18.199 --> 37:20.995
I share your impatience
with the conduct of the war,

37:21.079 --> 37:23.559
and I intend to do something about it.

37:52.960 --> 37:54.320
Cheers lads.

38:08.519 --> 38:10.880
- Did you go and meet him?
- I did.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.719
There were red flowers and French spies.

38:16.840 --> 38:19.719
And? What did you tell him?

38:20.360 --> 38:25.039
I didn't tell him anything, I left him a
message to say I'm going to the Far East.

38:27.599 --> 38:29.035
- You are?
- Aye.

38:29.119 --> 38:34.035
So whatever it is he
and that mad martinet, Lewes,

38:34.119 --> 38:38.119
whatever it is they're planning,
they can do it without me.

38:39.079 --> 38:42.079
- Who are they anyway?
- Just men I trained with.

38:43.000 --> 38:48.599
Stirling, you could dismiss
as a drinker, gambler,

38:49.960 --> 38:53.316
one of those Toff's you know who
climbed through the ranks

38:53.400 --> 38:55.719
on the branches of their family tree.

38:57.480 --> 38:59.599
Lewes, you could say is a bully,

39:00.679 --> 39:02.800
but with a bitter little mind,

39:04.480 --> 39:06.475
or you could dismiss him too.

39:06.559 --> 39:08.920
- But you don't dismiss them.
- No.

39:11.039 --> 39:14.599
No, because when the moment
comes, they are not themselves,

39:16.079 --> 39:18.075
none of the above is who they are,

39:18.159 --> 39:22.599
they are dead men

39:24.199 --> 39:26.119
just awaiting confirmation.

39:28.679 --> 39:30.119
Like me.

39:37.360 --> 39:39.800
But as I say, I'm going to the Far East.

39:41.320 --> 39:46.159
Ship me somewhere east of Suez
where the best is like the worst.

39:46.920 --> 39:51.280
The Far Eastern theatre will be a grand
show when it starts, you know.

40:00.079 --> 40:02.280
Heard you want to come as well.

40:02.679 --> 40:06.079
I'm putting together a unit,
I can request you if you want.

40:07.880 --> 40:12.360
Yeah. Fuck it. Why not.

40:30.320 --> 40:32.570
Where's Mayne?
You were supposed to bring him.

40:33.000 --> 40:36.079
Mayne says he's going to Burma
to fight the Japanese.

40:36.440 --> 40:37.916
We're not at war with Japan yet.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.920
No, but if Paddy's going,
we will be quite soon.

40:41.239 --> 40:43.480
- There's tea.
- Enjoy it old man.

40:44.519 --> 40:47.280
- It's for you.
- No it's not.

40:48.639 --> 40:52.000
If not my tea, I have an idea for you.

40:53.000 --> 40:56.079
A map. Oh goodness, this must be serious.

40:56.639 --> 41:00.840
Yes, it's actually a very large map,
which is a nuisance.

41:11.800 --> 41:15.356
Excuse me, gentlemen, I'd like to use
this table for a demonstration.

41:15.440 --> 41:16.555
How long will you be?

41:16.639 --> 41:19.316
It's a tournament,
we're going to be here all night.

41:19.400 --> 41:23.559
And if you're gonna stand there staring,
we will charge you admission.

41:23.920 --> 41:27.676
Yes. I'm afraid I have a rendezvous
at the Kit Kat Club later

41:27.760 --> 41:29.920
and I don't have all night, gentlemen.

41:30.400 --> 41:35.920
I've just got back from a deep
desert patrol and I'm mad as fuck.

41:38.639 --> 41:40.475
- What's he doing?
- Grenade.

41:40.559 --> 41:44.119
- Out! Quickly!
- Out the way!

41:47.800 --> 41:51.196
My men are bored, they make these little
novelties to brighten their day.

41:51.280 --> 41:54.316
This one's excellent if you can't get
a seat on the train.

41:54.400 --> 41:57.435
- You haven't changed then, Stirling?
- No.

41:57.519 --> 42:00.796
- You haven't grown up or anything?
- I'm still about 12.

42:00.880 --> 42:03.155
Stink bombs and bike sheds.

42:03.239 --> 42:08.400
- Except now the stink is dead bodies.
- If that's what you're proposing, yes.

42:11.119 --> 42:12.276
You drew this yourself?

42:12.360 --> 42:14.995
GHQ maps are inaccurate and outdated.

42:15.079 --> 42:17.756
That's because the German's keep
advancing while we fold our arms

42:17.840 --> 42:20.316
and say, not ideal, unattractive, gloomy.

42:20.400 --> 42:23.836
Do you know any General that doesn't
speak like a nursery nurse?

42:23.920 --> 42:27.075
The Germans have advanced
800 miles in six weeks.

42:27.159 --> 42:28.995
Everywhere it's Rommel this
and Rommel that

42:29.079 --> 42:32.760
but, in my opinion, he's made a mistake,
he's moved too fast.

42:33.199 --> 42:34.920
Look at this supply line.

42:36.679 --> 42:39.199
It's around 300 miles too long.

42:39.519 --> 42:42.475
So far, we have been attacking
the German convoys from the sea,

42:42.559 --> 42:44.316
that is why we are always expected.

42:44.400 --> 42:46.920
- Right, and you have a better idea?
- Yes.

42:48.440 --> 42:52.320
A doctor stoned on laughing gas
said something about parachutes.

42:53.960 --> 42:56.276
Instead of attacking from the sea,

42:56.360 --> 42:59.760
we should be attacking
from the Sea of Sand.

43:00.800 --> 43:03.916
We parachute units of selected
men into the interior

43:04.000 --> 43:07.316
and then attack Rommel's
supply line from the desert.

43:07.400 --> 43:09.920
- A disciplined group of men.
- Discipline...

43:10.960 --> 43:14.716
I myself would consult quickly with
Johnny Walker before each engagement,

43:14.800 --> 43:17.196
how would that be with your
idea of discipline?

43:17.280 --> 43:20.599
- Is that important to you?
- It's an indicative example.

43:21.079 --> 43:24.756
I once had this idea
in a sweaty dream one night

43:24.840 --> 43:27.435
that all regimental discipline
is horse shit,

43:27.519 --> 43:30.876
each man should be a chess piece
that can move in any direction.

43:30.960 --> 43:33.716
His idiosyncrasies are his own business.

43:33.800 --> 43:35.035
The most important thing is courage.

43:35.119 --> 43:38.840
The most important thing is wit
in every sense of that word.

43:39.280 --> 43:42.396
Anything expected fails,
never be where you are meant to be.

43:42.480 --> 43:44.475
Actually, the first thing
we would need to do

43:44.559 --> 43:47.515
is prove that the principle
of a parachute drop is sound.

43:47.599 --> 43:51.159
No one has ever parachuted
in the desert before. Not ever.

43:51.880 --> 43:55.599
When a vulture spreads its wings
out there it goes up, not down.

44:00.199 --> 44:03.440
So someone would need to try it.

44:05.760 --> 44:06.920
Yes.

44:07.800 --> 44:09.679
Just us. You and I.

44:10.639 --> 44:13.955
I was hoping Mayne would join us
but we can do it without him.

44:14.039 --> 44:18.159
We prove it can be done and we prove
to each other that we are committed.

44:18.639 --> 44:20.280
No one to stand us down.

44:21.480 --> 44:23.199
No one to stand us down.

44:26.400 --> 44:28.639
What should we call ourselves?

44:31.159 --> 44:32.440
So you're in?

44:33.800 --> 44:35.440
Stirling, are you in?

44:37.679 --> 44:39.519
You stole the parachutes,

44:40.360 --> 44:42.440
I will steal an aeroplane.

44:51.159 --> 44:54.559
QATTARA AIR STRIP 50 Miles West Of Cairo

45:14.480 --> 45:16.836
There's just no way. There is no...

45:16.920 --> 45:20.435
Lieutenant, this man claims he has
the authority to commander my plane.

45:20.519 --> 45:21.995
At ease. He has permission.

45:22.079 --> 45:26.239
I've already explained, this is war work,
and we have a licence to behave badly.

45:26.719 --> 45:30.115
I'm a fucking postman you know,
I deliver military mail.

45:30.199 --> 45:32.196
I want to know what's going on.

45:32.280 --> 45:34.276
I want to know who you are
and the name of your unit.

45:34.360 --> 45:36.679
- Did you think of a name?
- No, not yet.

45:38.079 --> 45:41.595
If you're even considering using my plane
to make a parachute drop,

45:41.679 --> 45:43.435
you're not going anywhere
in this weather you know.

45:43.519 --> 45:45.595
The forecast has this blowing over
in one hour.

45:45.679 --> 45:48.480
- No one parachutes in the desert.
- We know.

45:48.840 --> 45:51.955
- And your parachutes have static lines.
- They have what?

45:52.039 --> 45:53.280
They have static lines.

45:53.599 --> 45:57.800
Look, these lines have to be clipped
to a steel cable attached fore and aft.

45:58.280 --> 46:01.320
My plane is de Havilland
it doesn't have a cable.

46:02.639 --> 46:03.676
We'll use the seats.

46:03.760 --> 46:08.475
Yes, we'll tie the parachute cables to the
seats. The legs of the passenger seat.

46:08.559 --> 46:11.396
How much actual parachute training
have you had?

46:11.480 --> 46:14.435
We spent three weeks jumping from
scaffolding and moving vehicles.

46:14.519 --> 46:18.955
- And rolling forwards and sideways.
- And the door opens to the wind.

46:19.039 --> 46:21.595
- Almonds, take the door off.
- Yes, Sir.

46:21.679 --> 46:24.435
But by the time this weather
blows over, it will be dark.

46:24.519 --> 46:27.599
So, how will you find your way back
if it's dark?

46:28.000 --> 46:29.159
Lewes?

46:29.679 --> 46:31.480
- The stars.
- The stars. Yes.

46:32.239 --> 46:35.356
Sir, with the storm and the failing light,
why don't we pick again.

46:35.440 --> 46:39.155
Lewes, it sounds like your sergeant
is suggesting we stand down.

46:39.239 --> 46:41.840
We do not fucking stand down anymore.

46:42.800 --> 46:46.876
That should be the name of our unit,
The Men Who Refuse To Stand Down.

46:46.960 --> 46:50.239
I believe on the grounds of hazard,
I could refuse to take you.

46:50.639 --> 46:56.360
If you don't wanna fly, I flew a crop
sprayer once. I'll fly that thing myself.

46:56.880 --> 46:59.880
- Good god, he's American.
- Even so, he's okay.

47:00.880 --> 47:05.239
- You are all fucking mad.
- At last, he gets it.

47:06.719 --> 47:08.039
I need a piss.

47:13.880 --> 47:15.880
- Chop-chop.
- Yes, Sir.

48:14.719 --> 48:16.159
Good luck, Sir.

48:23.800 --> 48:25.199
Here, Stirling.

49:29.280 --> 49:31.440
Now head back to the airstrip.

49:45.719 --> 49:47.639
60 seconds until we go.

50:04.639 --> 50:07.119
What do you think about just before?

50:07.840 --> 50:11.480
I think about the voice inside of my head
that says so what.

50:13.039 --> 50:14.639
So fucking what?

52:39.280 --> 52:41.159
Did you have a fall, son?

52:47.840 --> 52:49.599
Yes, Father, I did.

52:51.800 --> 52:53.719
- Am I dead?
- Not quite.

52:55.239 --> 52:56.760
In between, I think.

52:59.400 --> 53:01.635
Remember when you said
you could climb the old oak tree

53:01.719 --> 53:03.760
with one arm tied behind your back?

53:04.760 --> 53:07.276
You always imagined you could do things
you couldn't do,

53:07.360 --> 53:09.639
climb higher than your natural limit.

53:10.480 --> 53:13.639
I would've hoped you might've grown
out of it by now.

53:19.920 --> 53:22.039
I can't move my legs, Dad.

53:24.599 --> 53:26.400
I can't feel my legs.

53:28.199 --> 53:30.920
I can't feel anything below my waist.

53:31.719 --> 53:35.079
Many a time, I've been half in love
with easeful death.

53:36.400 --> 53:39.360
Called him soft names
in many a mused rhyme.

53:40.719 --> 53:43.000
To take into the air my quiet breath,

53:44.719 --> 53:47.515
now more than ever seems it rich to die.

53:47.599 --> 53:50.595
- No, no, no, no.
- That was always your favourite poem.

53:50.679 --> 53:52.719
Always in the back of your mind.

53:54.159 --> 53:56.760
Half in love with easeful death.

53:57.960 --> 54:01.239
I have things to do.
I will not be buried.

54:01.920 --> 54:05.519
I will not. I will not be stood down.

54:07.039 --> 54:08.679
Not even by God.

54:09.679 --> 54:13.519
Do you hear me, God?
Do you hear me, Father?

54:14.559 --> 54:16.480
I will end this fucking war.

54:20.840 --> 54:24.119
I will not be stood down.

54:38.000 --> 54:42.920
