$14.50

04:28.834 --> 04:29.934
thanks, hon.

04:36.608 --> 04:37.742
Everyday.

05:27.092 --> 05:29.760
Lee, I'm gonna step out
of the car.

06:39.030 --> 06:42.133
I guess you have heard the
nature foundation finally hired

06:42.135 --> 06:43.634
an executive director.

06:44.136 --> 06:45.403
So?

06:45.405 --> 06:46.837
So.
So...

06:46.839 --> 06:48.739
He's 35 and never been married.

06:49.141 --> 06:50.441
So?

06:50.443 --> 06:53.511
So, he's 35 and never
been married.

06:53.513 --> 06:54.945
He's gotta be gay.
Oh, he's gay.

06:56.448 --> 06:57.982
Don't you think you're
jumping to conclusions?

06:57.984 --> 06:59.483
I bet I'm his type.

06:59.485 --> 07:00.651
You're not his type,
I'm his type.

07:00.653 --> 07:01.719
I'm his type.

07:03.189 --> 07:04.755
Aren't you on their board?

07:05.490 --> 07:06.557
Whose board?

07:06.559 --> 07:07.792
The nature foundation.

07:07.794 --> 07:09.960
Yes, you can introduce us.

07:09.962 --> 07:11.028
Yes.

07:11.030 --> 07:11.028
No.

07:11.030 --> 07:13.931
You can throw a party for him.
Why would I do that?

07:13.933 --> 07:16.734
You love parties. You have
parties for everyone.

07:16.736 --> 07:18.969
We're not going to have a party
just so that you two can...

07:18.971 --> 07:20.438
Act like idiots.

07:22.707 --> 07:23.808
You know what?

07:24.576 --> 07:25.843
Screw this.

07:25.845 --> 07:27.044
Come on, Lyle.

07:27.046 --> 07:28.679
Don't need your stupid parties.

07:30.615 --> 07:31.816
Hey.

07:33.685 --> 07:36.787
I've already agreed to have a
party for him in two weeks.

07:36.789 --> 07:39.690
Damn. That was easy.

07:39.692 --> 07:40.858
Later, loser.

08:14.860 --> 08:16.627
Hey.

08:16.629 --> 08:17.761
Looks a lot like work.

08:18.497 --> 08:19.663
It's not that bad.

08:21.967 --> 08:23.033
So...

08:23.935 --> 08:25.970
I know this is...

08:25.972 --> 08:28.706
Really none of my business.

08:28.708 --> 08:31.876
But, I was talking to Cathy

08:31.878 --> 08:35.578
and she happened
to mention that...

08:35.581 --> 08:37.715
You've been drinking
a lot, lately.

08:42.721 --> 08:44.822
Hey, I'm sorry I'm late.

08:49.295 --> 08:51.228
I just stopped by the store.

08:56.535 --> 08:57.968
Did you get to sleep?

08:57.970 --> 08:59.036
No.

08:59.871 --> 09:01.672
Got to talk to Tina, though.

09:06.211 --> 09:07.545
Really?

09:09.080 --> 09:10.915
You told her I drank too much?

09:12.250 --> 09:14.018
You do drink too much.

09:14.020 --> 09:15.553
You get drunk everyday.

09:16.855 --> 09:18.656
What am I supposed to do?

09:18.658 --> 09:20.758
Just act like everything's
all right, while you crawl

09:20.760 --> 09:22.259
into a beer every night,
is that it?

09:25.330 --> 09:27.097
You don't even know I exist,

09:27.099 --> 09:29.867
I have to talk to someone
every now and then.

09:29.869 --> 09:31.936
Why can't you keep
your mouth shut?

09:31.938 --> 09:33.871
You've been talking
to her about our sex life.

09:34.205 --> 09:35.739
What sex life?

09:35.741 --> 09:37.675
We haven't had sex in months.

09:43.615 --> 09:45.249
Why are you so miserable, Lee?

09:45.251 --> 09:47.184
Why do you drink so much?

09:47.186 --> 09:48.852
I am sick of it.

09:50.589 --> 09:52.356
Is it because you lost your job?

09:52.358 --> 09:54.758
Or is it because you
dropped out of school?

09:54.760 --> 09:56.727
Is it because
your daddy left you?

09:56.729 --> 09:57.995
Your mommy put you in day care?

09:57.997 --> 09:59.163
Keep quiet.
Is that it?

10:00.265 --> 10:01.899
Why don't you get over it?

10:06.271 --> 10:08.072
Why can't you have sex with me?

10:09.841 --> 10:11.375
You know what I think?

10:11.377 --> 10:12.776
I don't think it's me at all.

10:12.778 --> 10:14.078
You know what I think?
I think you're a...

10:14.080 --> 10:16.013
Shut up!
Just shut up!

10:46.811 --> 10:48.112
I'm not sure,

10:51.750 --> 10:54.251
I saw the man grab her,

10:54.253 --> 10:58.055
and then he pushed her,

10:58.057 --> 10:59.890
and she fell.

11:01.326 --> 11:02.760
Did he say anything?

11:02.961 --> 11:04.028
No.

11:04.863 --> 11:06.730
Um, actually...

11:07.165 --> 11:09.400
Yes, he said...

11:09.402 --> 11:10.801
"I'll kill you."

11:12.337 --> 11:13.837
Are you sure about that?

11:14.839 --> 11:17.274
Yes, he said he would kill her.

11:17.276 --> 11:19.043
Well, that makes this a felony.

11:19.045 --> 11:20.177
A felony?

11:20.679 --> 11:22.146
Yeah.

11:22.148 --> 11:24.248
Aggravated malicious wounding.

11:27.352 --> 11:29.953
Well, thank you very much
for your time.

11:29.955 --> 11:31.755
She was lucky you were around.

11:44.269 --> 11:45.803
Hey, Ben.

11:45.805 --> 11:47.071
Hey, Jeb.

11:47.073 --> 11:49.039
This is going to be
another 20 minutes.

11:49.041 --> 11:50.841
Uh, the judge has worked in
another hearing.

11:51.009 --> 11:52.142
God.

11:55.113 --> 11:56.433
Some drunk beat up
his girlfriend.

11:58.183 --> 11:59.783
Thanks.
Yeah.

12:03.121 --> 12:04.755
George Wickham.

12:04.757 --> 12:06.490
Ben. Ben Bennett.

12:06.492 --> 12:09.426
It's my first time here.
Any advice?

12:10.228 --> 12:11.962
Uh, well...

12:11.964 --> 12:13.330
What kind of case do you have?

12:13.332 --> 12:15.232
Criminal defense.

12:15.234 --> 12:17.501
Then you're sitting
at the wrong table.

12:17.503 --> 12:19.303
Uh, the prosecutor sits
over there.

12:19.305 --> 12:20.370
Right, thanks.

12:23.041 --> 12:24.241
Where do you practice?

12:24.243 --> 12:26.443
Knoxville, mostly
in northeast Tennessee.

12:27.879 --> 12:29.113
Where'd you go to school?

12:29.115 --> 12:30.380
Uh, Richmond.

12:30.382 --> 12:31.448
You?

12:31.450 --> 12:32.516
Uh, Yale.

12:33.118 --> 12:35.119
Well, excuse me.

12:36.454 --> 12:38.155
Here's that case you asked for.

12:38.857 --> 12:39.857
Great.

12:43.895 --> 12:45.963
So, what's the hold up?

12:45.965 --> 12:48.766
Uh, judge is working in
a hearing.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.334
Some drunk beat up
his girlfriend.

13:04.983 --> 13:06.850
All rise.

13:46.457 --> 13:48.258
Don't cut...
Hey.

13:49.460 --> 13:52.529
Everything looks great.

13:52.531 --> 13:56.366
I've planned on sending a couple of
servers out with trays around seven.

13:56.368 --> 13:58.001
That be all right?

13:58.003 --> 13:59.269
That's great.
Good.

14:04.309 --> 14:05.409
Glass of wine?

14:06.311 --> 14:07.511
Yes.

14:07.513 --> 14:08.946
Thank you.
You're welcome.

14:25.597 --> 14:27.497
There's nobody here.
Let's go.

14:30.268 --> 14:31.501
Yes?

14:31.503 --> 14:33.337
Good afternoon.

14:33.339 --> 14:35.172
We got some hot meals for you.

14:35.174 --> 14:37.107
We're from community in action.

14:40.080 --> 14:40.979
What is it?

14:40.980 --> 14:45.916
Roast beef, uh, mashed
potatoes, some green beans.

14:52.590 --> 14:54.191
God bless you.

15:05.637 --> 15:08.972
<i>So, who's this party for anyway?</i>

15:08.974 --> 15:12.943
Chuck Bingley, the new executive
director for the nature foundation.

15:12.945 --> 15:15.045
So, I'm guessing he's gay?

15:15.047 --> 15:16.413
I'm pretty sure he's straight,

15:16.415 --> 15:17.481
I've only met him once.

15:18.116 --> 15:19.316
What's he like?

15:19.318 --> 15:21.518
Well, he's good-looking.

15:21.520 --> 15:23.020
He's into nature.

15:23.022 --> 15:25.188
A little rough around the edges.

15:25.190 --> 15:28.325
Awkward around people, I'm afraid he
won't impress some of the bigger donors.

15:28.327 --> 15:32.462
Well, do they want someone that knows land
preservation or looks good on a golf course?

15:32.464 --> 15:33.563
Oh, both.

15:36.235 --> 15:37.634
It started at four o'clock.

15:37.636 --> 15:39.703
You did not. Four o'clock, for a party?
Yes, he did.

15:39.705 --> 15:41.605
Lyle, really?

15:42.173 --> 15:43.240
Oh.

15:43.242 --> 15:44.308
Is he here yet?

15:44.509 --> 15:45.575
No.

15:46.577 --> 15:47.644
He's straight.

15:48.112 --> 15:49.179
Shit.

15:50.615 --> 15:51.682
Really?

15:54.619 --> 15:56.253
Let's get a drink.

16:05.997 --> 16:07.331
Here it is.

16:07.333 --> 16:08.999
You sure it's all right
if I tag along?

16:09.200 --> 16:10.267
Yeah.

16:11.436 --> 16:13.103
I don't think
I'm ready for this.

16:14.138 --> 16:15.418
Do you want me to take you home?

16:17.075 --> 16:18.141
Yeah.

16:18.376 --> 16:19.443
Okay.

16:20.244 --> 16:21.311
No.

16:22.680 --> 16:24.281
Can't keep avoiding people.

16:24.615 --> 16:26.416
Look.

16:26.418 --> 16:28.858
Just let me know if you wanna
leave, it's no big deal, really.

16:30.389 --> 16:32.389
You've only been
in recovery a month.

16:32.391 --> 16:33.657
Don't be so hard on yourself.

16:35.326 --> 16:36.393
Thanks.

16:39.163 --> 16:40.764
Oh, perfect timing.

16:43.335 --> 16:44.434
Um, excuse me.

16:50.074 --> 16:52.042
Um, hi.

16:52.044 --> 16:53.143
Uh, you must be Chuck.

16:53.544 --> 16:54.644
I'm Chuck.

16:56.147 --> 16:57.647
And I'm Jane Gardiner.

16:59.250 --> 17:00.784
Uh, um, this is Lee.

17:00.786 --> 17:02.252
Hello.

17:02.254 --> 17:03.687
Well, come on inside.

17:09.727 --> 17:11.494
There's the guest of honor.

17:11.497 --> 17:12.561
Sorry, we're late.

17:12.564 --> 17:13.797
Don't worry about it.

17:13.799 --> 17:15.479
Everybody's looking
forward to meeting you.

17:17.268 --> 17:18.367
Oh, uh...

17:18.369 --> 17:19.770
This is my friend, Lee Darcy.

17:19.771 --> 17:21.204
Lee works at Eastgate.

17:21.205 --> 17:22.571
We did volunteer work together.

17:22.574 --> 17:24.374
Lee, this is Ben Bennett.

17:24.376 --> 17:26.242
Ben's in the board
of the nature foundation.

17:26.711 --> 17:28.278
Nice to meet you.

17:28.280 --> 17:30.714
Glad you were able to make it.

17:30.716 --> 17:32.249
I've met you before, haven't I?

17:33.718 --> 17:35.719
Eastgate, do you work
with Jon Ross?

17:35.721 --> 17:37.554
He and I have done a
bunch of deals together.

17:37.556 --> 17:40.490
I know Mr. Ross, but I
don't think he knows me.

17:40.492 --> 17:42.225
I work in the machine shop.

17:44.796 --> 17:47.798
All right, well, come
on, have a drink.

17:55.473 --> 17:57.741
I think everything's going well.

17:57.743 --> 18:01.511
It certainly seems to be going
well for Jane and Daniel Boone.

18:04.515 --> 18:07.617
He's not her type,
she's just playing hostess.

18:07.619 --> 18:11.288
She's playing something
but it ain't hostess.

18:11.290 --> 18:12.789
Well, uh...

18:12.791 --> 18:15.325
It'd allow me to dirtbag my way
around Colorado and Wyoming.

18:17.328 --> 18:21.098
Hey, uh, we're just talking
about Chuck's new job.

18:21.100 --> 18:23.600
You had a chance to get up
in the mountains here, yet?

18:23.602 --> 18:25.836
Yeah, I've already seen
some amazing places.

18:25.838 --> 18:28.271
I'm going hiking this
Saturday at Whitetop.

18:28.273 --> 18:29.673
Do you hike?

18:29.675 --> 18:31.475
Would you two like to tag along?

18:32.210 --> 18:34.611
That sounds fun.

18:34.613 --> 18:37.347
Well, I wish I could.
I have a lot of work to do.

18:42.453 --> 18:46.223
Oh, um, maybe some other time.

18:46.225 --> 18:48.758
Well, I need another drink.
Can I get you something?

18:50.261 --> 18:51.561
Um...

18:51.563 --> 18:52.863
I'm fine.

18:53.831 --> 18:55.799
Excuse me.
Thank you.

19:00.171 --> 19:02.372
What are you doing, you idiot?

19:02.374 --> 19:04.508
Why'd you tell him
that you couldn't go?

19:04.510 --> 19:07.611
He's gorgeous and nice,
I wanna go.

19:08.146 --> 19:09.880
Go.

19:09.882 --> 19:12.716
I can't do that, he asked us together,
he thinks that we're a couple.

19:12.718 --> 19:14.351
Why would he think
we're a couple?

19:14.353 --> 19:15.785
Because we act like a couple!

19:15.787 --> 19:17.754
Don't deny him. Go.

19:17.756 --> 19:19.456
I can't do that,
I'll look desperate.

19:19.458 --> 19:21.291
Just tell him that you've
changed your mind.

19:22.793 --> 19:24.628
Then he'd still think
we're a couple

19:24.630 --> 19:26.363
and I have a lot of work to do.

19:26.365 --> 19:28.198
You work all the time.

19:28.200 --> 19:30.800
And he'll figure out we're not
a couple at some other point.

19:30.802 --> 19:33.403
Just tell him that you've changed
your mind, and we'll go.

19:33.405 --> 19:34.604
Go where?

19:34.606 --> 19:36.573
Go hiking with Chuck
on Saturday.

19:36.575 --> 19:37.641
Hiking?

19:39.610 --> 19:41.278
Please?

19:41.280 --> 19:43.346
For once, just do it.

19:45.616 --> 19:47.317
Okay.

19:47.319 --> 19:49.653
I'll call him after the party.

19:49.655 --> 19:51.188
You don't hike.

19:51.190 --> 19:52.522
What's wrong with him?

19:52.524 --> 19:53.857
She doesn't hike.

19:53.859 --> 19:53.857
What's going on?

19:53.859 --> 19:57.561
Chuck invited Jane and Ben
to go hiking this weekend.

20:00.331 --> 20:01.898
And the queers got left out?

20:01.900 --> 20:03.867
Bullseye, my invisible friend.

20:09.440 --> 20:10.874
What are you doing
this Saturday?

20:15.413 --> 20:18.281
Well, actually, we just
got back from Cabo

20:18.283 --> 20:21.351
and normally, we would about spend
two weeks there, but Bob had to come

20:21.353 --> 20:24.254
back early, because we had
to oversee the construction

20:24.256 --> 20:26.256
of the lake house.
So...

20:26.258 --> 20:28.225
Oh, that's great,
will you excuse me?

20:28.227 --> 20:29.292
Sure.

20:42.673 --> 20:44.641
Still trying to figure
out where I've seen you.

20:46.344 --> 20:50.814
Everyone please hold your
cards for a possible bingo.

20:51.315 --> 20:52.716
Who is that?

21:02.794 --> 21:05.895
Let me introduce you
to my friends.

21:05.897 --> 21:07.731
This is Kittner Frost.

21:07.733 --> 21:10.500
Hey, pleasure to meet you.

21:10.502 --> 21:12.902
I'm the vice president
at old dominion bank.

21:12.904 --> 21:12.902
Welcome to Abingdon.

21:12.904 --> 21:17.741
If you need anything, please,
please, let me know.

21:17.743 --> 21:20.043
Kittner. And this
is Lyle Jennings.

21:20.045 --> 21:21.444
Lyle is...

21:21.446 --> 21:23.046
Busy spending his inheritance.

21:24.315 --> 21:26.750
This is Lee Darcy.

21:26.752 --> 21:29.419
It's nice to meet you,
what do you do?

21:29.421 --> 21:31.288
Um, work at Eastgate.

21:31.290 --> 21:33.757
Oh.
What do you do there?

21:33.759 --> 21:35.392
I'm...
I'm a welder.

21:36.460 --> 21:37.527
Oh.

21:44.068 --> 21:46.336
It was nice meeting
you, guys. Excuse me.

21:49.408 --> 21:50.840
Sir, would you like a drink?

21:50.842 --> 21:52.509
No, no, thank you.

22:07.992 --> 22:11.661
Oh? Really?
I think you must be right.

22:13.798 --> 22:15.765
Um, excuse me.

22:15.767 --> 22:17.033
Sure.

22:17.868 --> 22:19.602
Hey man, I gotta go.

22:19.604 --> 22:21.471
Okay, no problem.

22:21.473 --> 22:23.573
No, you stay here,
I'm gonna go for a walk.

22:23.575 --> 22:24.855
Give me a call when you're done.

22:25.810 --> 22:27.410
You sure?
Yeah.

22:27.412 --> 22:28.478
I'm fine, man.

22:46.464 --> 22:48.465
I've just realized where
I've seen him before.

22:50.134 --> 22:52.769
I saw him get charged with
a felony a few months ago.

22:55.940 --> 22:58.975
He thinks I'm the biggest asshole
on the face of the planet.

23:18.929 --> 23:20.163
Chuck?

23:24.101 --> 23:25.735
Hope you weren't
waiting too long.

23:26.470 --> 23:28.405
Hey, no problem, uh...

23:29.106 --> 23:29.105
I just got here.

23:29.107 --> 23:33.076
Uh, besides, Ben from the party called.
He and his girlfriend

23:33.078 --> 23:34.878
are coming, so,
we gotta wait on them.

23:36.013 --> 23:37.113
All right.

23:38.816 --> 23:40.550
I hope that's okay,

23:40.552 --> 23:42.085
I guess I should've asked you.

23:42.087 --> 23:43.686
That's cool.

23:43.688 --> 23:43.686
Who's coming?

23:43.688 --> 23:46.790
Well, the couple that
had the party for me?

23:48.159 --> 23:49.926
Oh, the party you
went to without me.

23:51.462 --> 23:52.595
I don't know them.

25:28.092 --> 25:29.626
Thank you.

25:29.628 --> 25:30.693
You're welcome.

25:47.811 --> 25:49.012
Oh, I hate hiking.

25:49.647 --> 25:50.847
What do you mean?

25:50.849 --> 25:52.181
It's such a waste of time.

25:52.183 --> 25:53.917
I really don't see
what the big deal is.

25:53.919 --> 25:55.552
I only do it to make Lee happy.

25:56.854 --> 25:58.154
I don't mind hiking alone.

26:02.126 --> 26:03.860
Why don't we head up this Ridge?

26:03.862 --> 26:06.296
So... how long have you
and Ben been together?

26:06.298 --> 26:08.798
Jane, how long has it been?
Since kindergarten?

26:10.267 --> 26:12.168
Oh, you mean, together?

26:12.170 --> 26:14.938
Yeah, we're not together.

26:14.940 --> 26:16.773
Ben and I are just friends.

26:16.775 --> 26:19.008
Oh, well, Chuck said
you were a couple.

26:19.010 --> 26:21.744
Oh, I suppose I just
assumed you were together.

26:22.613 --> 26:24.047
So, do you have a boyfriend?

26:24.049 --> 26:26.115
No.

26:26.117 --> 26:28.718
What about you? Do you
have a girlfriend, Ben?

26:28.720 --> 26:29.986
No, I'm gay.

26:29.988 --> 26:31.688
But I don't have a boyfriend.

26:31.690 --> 26:33.089
You don't act like you're gay.

26:36.026 --> 26:37.694
How do gays act?

26:37.696 --> 26:40.063
Oh, come on, you know.

26:40.065 --> 26:42.231
No, I don't.

26:42.233 --> 26:44.667
Hey, I don't have
a problem with gays.

26:44.669 --> 26:47.704
We had one where I worked. I
treated him like he was normal.

26:47.706 --> 26:49.606
Come on, Cathy.

26:49.608 --> 26:52.875
Ever since, Lee's gone to Aa,
he's Saint Lee the tolerant.

26:55.045 --> 26:56.779
Not all gays

26:56.781 --> 26:58.181
are flamboyant.

27:23.007 --> 27:25.708
I didn't think you bitches
would ever stop.

27:55.239 --> 27:56.673
Let's do this.

27:57.841 --> 27:59.442
All right, anything else?

27:59.444 --> 28:01.911
Sit down, son.
It will be over soon.

28:04.248 --> 28:06.883
Glad we were
able to work this one out.

28:06.885 --> 28:10.887
Well, I don't know. It rubs me the
wrong way to allow junior over there

28:10.889 --> 28:12.789
to plead to anything
less than a felony.

28:12.791 --> 28:13.956
But...

28:13.958 --> 28:16.125
You've managed
to trash our only witness.

28:16.760 --> 28:18.394
Besides,

28:18.396 --> 28:21.397
judge Jackson doesn't know
squat about criminal law.

28:21.399 --> 28:23.933
You know he was a real estate
attorney before his political buddies

28:23.935 --> 28:25.468
slipped him on the bench?

28:25.470 --> 28:26.869
All rise.

28:30.340 --> 28:32.909
Please be seated.

28:32.911 --> 28:34.711
Is the commonwealth
ready to proceed?

28:34.713 --> 28:34.711
Yes, your honor.

28:34.713 --> 28:37.246
Is the defense council
ready to proceed?

28:37.248 --> 28:38.981
Yes, your honor.

28:38.983 --> 28:41.451
Gentlemen, looks like we have a
plead ring that's been reached.

28:41.453 --> 28:44.454
Yes, subject to your approval...

28:44.456 --> 28:47.990
Uh, the defendant will plead no
contest to the lesser charges

28:47.992 --> 28:49.992
of assault and battery...

28:49.994 --> 28:52.495
With the recommended
sentence of one year probation.

28:55.299 --> 28:56.499
Well...

28:58.001 --> 29:00.803
I've, uh, reviewed the record.

29:02.206 --> 29:05.374
Stipulation indicates that,

29:05.376 --> 29:08.411
the defendant's girlfriend suffered
a concussion and broken arm.

29:08.413 --> 29:11.447
Seems like an extremely light
sentence under such circumstances.

29:13.484 --> 29:18.121
Your honor, the commonwealth has serious
problems with its only witness.

29:18.123 --> 29:22.291
Also, Mr. Carol just indicated he has concerns
regarding the court's lack of experience

29:22.293 --> 29:23.392
in handling criminal cases.

29:27.765 --> 29:29.298
Your honor,

29:29.300 --> 29:31.267
we would like
to ask that the, uh...

29:31.269 --> 29:34.370
Defendant be allowed to leave
the state despite probation

29:34.372 --> 29:36.172
to attend Notre Dame this fall.

29:37.040 --> 29:38.374
No objection.

29:39.910 --> 29:41.110
Very well.

29:43.447 --> 29:45.414
Let's take a short recess.

29:45.416 --> 29:47.416
Mr. Carol, see me
in chambers.

29:47.418 --> 29:48.851
All rise.

29:59.296 --> 30:00.797
Thank you very much.

30:03.133 --> 30:05.067
Hey, what are you
doing here, handsome?

30:05.569 --> 30:06.836
Had a hearing,

30:06.838 --> 30:08.304
I am too.
Just finishing up.

30:08.939 --> 30:10.239
That was John Altman.

30:10.241 --> 30:10.239
Senator?

30:10.241 --> 30:13.509
Son had too much to drink, got
a little rough with the date.

30:13.511 --> 30:14.877
What was the charge?

30:14.879 --> 30:17.246
Aggravated malicious wounding.

30:17.248 --> 30:19.148
How did she get
a domestic abuse felony

30:19.150 --> 30:21.217
reduced to a simple misdemeanor?

30:21.219 --> 30:22.885
The kind of money
the Altman's have,

30:22.887 --> 30:24.821
my entire staff's been working
on this case for two months.

30:24.823 --> 30:26.455
All they had to do was dig
up enough dirt on the girl,

30:26.457 --> 30:28.191
to blow holes
in her credibility.

30:28.193 --> 30:30.226
And you're not above
a cheap trick?

30:30.228 --> 30:33.262
Telling the judge that Wayne said he
didn't know how to try a criminal case?

30:33.264 --> 30:34.964
Hey, I didn't make it up.

30:35.299 --> 30:36.866
Besides,

30:36.868 --> 30:39.101
it's my job
to represent my client,

30:39.103 --> 30:41.504
if that means making the prosecutor
look bad, to finalize a plea bargain,

30:41.506 --> 30:42.572
then I'm doing it.

30:42.574 --> 30:44.173
How long you tied up here?

30:44.175 --> 30:46.375
Forty five minutes.

30:46.377 --> 30:48.010
Good, I should be done by then.

30:48.012 --> 30:49.892
Why don't you meet me
at the tavern for a drink?

30:51.615 --> 30:54.050
I shouldn't. I'm
covered up with work.

30:55.485 --> 30:57.587
I might count on you
changing your mind.

30:58.555 --> 31:00.056
It'd mean a lot to me.

31:01.391 --> 31:03.025
Shouldn't have
to celebrate alone.

31:04.962 --> 31:06.028
Just a drink.

31:17.307 --> 31:18.574
How'd it go?

31:23.447 --> 31:25.514
Good.
Fantastic.

31:25.516 --> 31:27.583
You have anymore
commitments this afternoon?

31:27.585 --> 31:29.418
Actually, no, I don't.

31:29.420 --> 31:31.420
Great, let's celebrate,
let's get that drink.

31:32.089 --> 31:33.489
Yeah.

31:33.491 --> 31:36.125
I... can't.

31:36.127 --> 31:39.962
I'm sorry if I've misread
the situation, all right?

31:39.964 --> 31:41.497
I don't wanna
make you uncomfortable.

31:43.033 --> 31:44.567
Misread the situation?

31:51.208 --> 31:52.675
A drink sounds good.

31:53.477 --> 31:55.278
Great, come on.

32:04.154 --> 32:06.522
She hasn't done anything to make you
think there's a problem, has she?

32:06.524 --> 32:09.724
She's probably not going to be too excited
about me living up here in the sticks.

32:11.628 --> 32:12.929
What about you?

32:13.530 --> 32:15.131
Is it hard not to drink?

32:15.966 --> 32:17.133
Sometimes.

32:19.236 --> 32:20.403
What makes it worse?

32:22.339 --> 32:23.572
I think too much.

32:24.274 --> 32:25.408
Thinking about what?

32:29.346 --> 32:30.980
It's kind of hard to explain.

32:34.251 --> 32:35.651
You don't know what
I'm really like.

32:38.221 --> 32:40.122
So...

32:40.124 --> 32:41.324
What are you really like?

32:43.026 --> 32:44.226
I'm, uh...

32:51.301 --> 32:52.468
Screwed up.

32:55.539 --> 32:57.039
That's not what
you were gonna say.

33:07.751 --> 33:09.685
You know...

33:09.687 --> 33:11.220
Why don't you stay over tonight?

33:12.189 --> 33:13.489
Go hiking in the morning?

33:13.491 --> 33:15.291
Oh, I wish I could.

33:15.293 --> 33:17.626
I have to get up early and
hit the office, I got a...

33:17.628 --> 33:19.228
Big hearing on Monday.

33:20.297 --> 33:21.764
Yeah, I should
probably work, too.

33:24.468 --> 33:26.335
But, we'll do this.

33:26.337 --> 33:28.170
No hiking.

33:28.172 --> 33:31.007
Just stay over tonight, we'll
leave first thing in the morning.

33:31.009 --> 33:33.309
I never really can sleep
well except in my own bed.

33:39.182 --> 33:40.449
Do you remember, Lee Darcy?

33:40.451 --> 33:42.651
You were representing
him when I met you.

33:42.653 --> 33:43.786
Yeah, I guess so.

33:45.589 --> 33:47.223
He was there, uh...

33:47.225 --> 33:49.558
Went hiking
with a friend of mine.

33:49.560 --> 33:51.560
Why would a friend of yours
know someone like that?

33:53.096 --> 33:55.197
Funny, you should mention them.

33:55.199 --> 33:57.566
The neighbor came into
my office a while back,

33:57.568 --> 33:59.568
tried to change her story.

33:59.570 --> 34:02.238
Apparently he didn't say he was
going to kill his girlfriend,

34:02.240 --> 34:04.106
but he split her head open.

34:04.108 --> 34:05.808
Probably banging
the neighbor now.

34:08.178 --> 34:10.146
No, he's still with
the girlfriend.

34:10.148 --> 34:12.415
She was on our hike, too.
Her name is Cathy.

34:12.417 --> 34:14.083
Cathy, yeah, yeah,
I remember her.

34:15.351 --> 34:16.719
Huh, doesn't surprise me,

34:16.721 --> 34:19.388
that kind always goes back
in for more abuse.

34:19.389 --> 34:21.257
Worthless as a witness too.

34:21.259 --> 34:23.018
She said she couldn't
remember what happened.

34:28.799 --> 34:30.266
What are you going
to do about her?

34:31.735 --> 34:34.303
Do about what?

34:34.304 --> 34:38.174
The fact that the only witness against
your client changed her testimony.

34:38.176 --> 34:40.141
Nothing, of course.

34:40.143 --> 34:41.844
Surprised the guy
paid me the first time.

34:42.712 --> 34:44.213
Oh.

34:44.215 --> 34:45.547
But enough shop talk.

34:48.819 --> 34:52.121
But now, before I go...

34:52.123 --> 34:54.790
I couldn't think of a better
way to spend the time.

35:32.662 --> 35:33.729
Hey.

35:35.732 --> 35:36.799
Hey.

35:45.876 --> 35:47.309
Sure is a pretty day.

35:48.178 --> 35:49.278
Yeah.

35:49.746 --> 35:51.514
It is.

35:51.516 --> 35:52.681
It's a great day for a hike.

35:53.183 --> 35:54.250
Yeah.

35:57.420 --> 35:58.888
This is a great spot.

36:01.191 --> 36:02.758
This is one of my favorites.

36:06.396 --> 36:07.630
You going any further?

36:09.699 --> 36:11.500
Thought I might head
up to Whitetop.

36:11.801 --> 36:12.868
Me, too.

36:13.837 --> 36:16.605
You hiking alone?
Yeah.

36:16.607 --> 36:18.841
Me, too all my
friends are tied up.

36:21.711 --> 36:24.313
I got the impression
they weren't that into hiking.

36:24.315 --> 36:25.848
They were...

36:25.850 --> 36:27.349
They were kind of colorful.

36:29.553 --> 36:31.520
I enjoyed meeting your
girlfriend, she was, uh...

36:32.189 --> 36:33.389
Pretty colorful.

36:34.891 --> 36:36.592
So you're arrogant
and you're gay?

36:38.929 --> 36:40.829
Yeah, I'm gay.

36:44.668 --> 36:46.569
Actually, I'm dating
George Wickham.

36:48.338 --> 36:51.640
Didn't he, uh,
defend you after you,

36:51.642 --> 36:53.375
got drunk and beat up
your girlfriend?

36:58.415 --> 36:59.481
Yeah.

37:02.753 --> 37:03.919
He did.

37:11.561 --> 37:14.230
Well, I'm gonna get going.

37:14.232 --> 37:15.297
I'll see you around.

37:35.819 --> 37:38.454
Okay, I give up.

37:39.856 --> 37:41.423
I actually have to take a break.

37:44.027 --> 37:45.294
Are we almost there?

37:45.662 --> 37:46.929
Yeah.

37:46.931 --> 37:48.364
We're really close.

37:49.432 --> 37:50.933
What's the surprise, anyway?

37:51.701 --> 37:52.901
You'll see.

37:52.903 --> 37:54.737
Come on, give me a hint.

37:57.007 --> 37:58.507
We were hiking all day.

38:00.877 --> 38:01.944
We're almost there.

38:02.879 --> 38:04.280
I promise.

38:05.649 --> 38:06.749
Come on.

40:04.901 --> 40:06.034
Hello?

40:06.636 --> 40:07.936
In here.

40:07.938 --> 40:10.572
Hey, going somewhere?

40:10.807 --> 40:10.806
Yes.

40:10.808 --> 40:14.843
George has agreed to spend the
weekend with me in Asheville.

40:14.845 --> 40:16.044
Did you approve of this?

40:16.046 --> 40:17.579
Absolutely not.

40:17.881 --> 40:19.148
Honey.

40:19.150 --> 40:23.552
Honey, we don't need
everything to be so...

40:23.554 --> 40:24.753
Matchy-matchy.

40:24.755 --> 40:26.755
We need something
that pops and says,

40:26.757 --> 40:28.891
"wow, I'm here."

40:42.639 --> 40:43.939
What's wrong with you?

40:43.941 --> 40:45.574
You dirty little whore.

40:47.011 --> 40:49.088
You know, you two are so negative.
You're just... jealous.

40:49.112 --> 40:50.546
Jealous?

40:50.548 --> 40:52.714
We haven't even met
Mr. perfect yet.

40:52.716 --> 40:52.714
You'll get a chance to meet him.

40:52.716 --> 40:56.485
When Chuck has his little
party next weekend.

40:56.820 --> 40:58.821
At his cabin.

40:58.823 --> 41:00.856
You two are invited
for some bizarre reason.

41:00.858 --> 41:01.924
Really?

41:02.993 --> 41:04.059
It's George.

41:04.527 --> 41:05.794
Hey.

41:05.796 --> 41:07.062
Almost finished packing.

41:09.165 --> 41:10.232
Oh.

41:10.733 --> 41:11.834
Well...

41:12.769 --> 41:14.236
No, no, it's okay.

41:14.238 --> 41:16.572
I'll just cancel the hotel
and come over to your place.

41:17.540 --> 41:18.607
You sure?

41:20.477 --> 41:21.977
Okay.

41:21.979 --> 41:23.479
Try to get some sleep.

41:24.113 --> 41:25.481
Okay.

41:31.721 --> 41:33.755
George is ill.
Trip's off.

41:33.757 --> 41:35.190
What's wrong?

41:35.192 --> 41:36.959
He's been sick all morning.

41:36.961 --> 41:38.026
Hmmm.

41:38.261 --> 41:39.528
What?

41:44.534 --> 41:46.034
I should check on him.

41:47.971 --> 41:49.838
I don't know where he lives.

41:49.840 --> 41:51.106
You don't even know
where he lives?

41:51.108 --> 41:54.076
Yes, I know where
he lives, but I just...

41:54.078 --> 41:56.945
Haven't been to his place,
I don't know his address.

41:56.947 --> 41:58.547
I don't think
you should do that.

41:59.582 --> 42:01.783
He obviously told you
not to come over.

42:01.785 --> 42:03.519
Open your eyes, Shelby.

42:04.588 --> 42:06.688
Shelby, open your eyes.

42:07.790 --> 42:08.857
It's not funny.

42:09.526 --> 42:10.692
Not funny.

43:04.247 --> 43:05.647
What are you doing here?

43:06.583 --> 43:07.950
I just came to see how...

43:10.086 --> 43:11.620
Come on, daddy.

43:16.326 --> 43:17.693
Hello.

43:18.861 --> 43:21.263
Karen, this is Ben Bennett.

43:21.265 --> 43:22.864
Ben's an attorney at Abingdon.

43:23.900 --> 43:26.868
Ben, this is my wife, Karen.

43:30.073 --> 43:31.340
It's nice to meet you.

43:39.649 --> 43:42.017
I'm afraid you caught us
heading out for the weekend.

43:44.854 --> 43:46.355
I was just...

43:47.223 --> 43:48.624
Walking.

43:52.862 --> 43:54.062
I don't wanna keep you.

43:54.964 --> 43:57.366
Well, uh, good to see you again.

43:59.235 --> 44:00.302
Thanks.

45:39.335 --> 45:41.303
There really is a cabin.

45:43.073 --> 45:44.339
Great, look who it is.

45:49.078 --> 45:50.178
Hey.

45:50.947 --> 45:52.481
Hey, you made it.

45:52.483 --> 45:53.949
You had trouble
with the directions?

45:53.951 --> 45:55.417
No, they were great.

45:56.953 --> 45:59.354
Hey, thank you for having us.

45:59.356 --> 46:00.956
I'm glad you came.

46:00.958 --> 46:02.424
You guys know Lee and Cathy?

46:02.426 --> 46:03.859
Hey.
Hi.

46:05.294 --> 46:07.996
Where's George? Look
forward to meeting him.

46:07.998 --> 46:09.064
Um...

46:10.133 --> 46:11.533
Uh, it didn't work out.

46:12.769 --> 46:14.102
Oh, uh...

46:15.371 --> 46:17.305
Why don't we go inside and
I'll show you around.

46:18.841 --> 46:20.041
We'll be on the deck.

46:23.913 --> 46:25.413
This is my bedroom.

46:26.949 --> 46:28.884
Then through here
is the rest of the place.

46:45.334 --> 46:47.969
Oh, uh, may I use your bathroom?

46:47.971 --> 46:50.071
There's a slight problem.

46:50.073 --> 46:52.941
The Springs sometimes runs
dry this time of year.

46:52.943 --> 46:56.978
Well, uh, we won't have
water again until it rains.

46:56.980 --> 46:58.413
You'll have to use the outhouse.

47:00.449 --> 47:02.150
That's it, over there.

47:08.558 --> 47:10.058
Oh, uh...

47:10.593 --> 47:12.861
No problem, thanks.

47:14.463 --> 47:16.865
Hold up, back up,
I gotta see this, sorry.

47:18.568 --> 47:21.570
Sorry, we had water
until this morning.

47:22.205 --> 47:23.438
It's all right.

47:25.474 --> 47:26.875
Ah, do you wanna see the deck?

48:08.918 --> 48:10.051
Hey.

48:19.996 --> 48:22.716
You don't have to go. You don't have
to leave just 'cause I got here.

48:26.369 --> 48:29.304
I know it's not
any of my business, but...

48:29.306 --> 48:31.273
Why'd you plead guilty
to a felony?

48:33.976 --> 48:35.343
I don't want to talk about it.

48:36.445 --> 48:37.946
I'm an alcoholic.

48:40.082 --> 48:43.318
Cathy and I got into an argument,
and I threatened to kill her.

48:45.288 --> 48:46.688
Pushed her

48:46.690 --> 48:48.023
and she hit her head.

48:50.059 --> 48:51.259
She had to go to the hospital.

48:55.631 --> 48:58.333
So, you threatened to kill her?
What did you say?

48:59.568 --> 49:00.969
I don't...

49:00.971 --> 49:02.504
I don't remember
the actual words.

49:04.440 --> 49:06.641
I was very drunk.

49:06.643 --> 49:08.510
Not that I'm using
this as an excuse.

49:09.712 --> 49:11.947
I take full responsibility
for what I did.

49:14.483 --> 49:16.351
I just don't remember
the details.

49:18.220 --> 49:20.288
I understand I said,

49:20.290 --> 49:22.557
"I'll kill you",
when I pushed her.

49:22.559 --> 49:24.259
Where was the evidence
that you said that?

49:26.095 --> 49:27.963
Well, my neighbor
heard me say it.

49:28.998 --> 49:31.733
And my attorney, George.

49:33.202 --> 49:36.271
He said, I didn't have
a defense because...

49:36.273 --> 49:37.633
There was
an independent witness...

49:38.307 --> 49:40.241
Testifying against me.

49:40.243 --> 49:41.723
And I have no memory
of what happened.

49:44.613 --> 49:46.348
Did George interview
the neighbor?

49:48.286 --> 49:49.185
No.

49:49.186 --> 49:54.089
But, uh, the policeman
took her statement.

49:54.091 --> 49:55.423
Did Cathy say
you threatened her?

49:55.425 --> 49:57.158
She doesn't really
remember what happened.

49:57.160 --> 49:58.393
Look...

49:58.395 --> 50:00.095
I didn't intend
to get into all this.

50:01.163 --> 50:02.731
I messed up.

50:02.733 --> 50:04.599
I had a job lined up in Atlanta.

50:04.601 --> 50:06.501
Cathy and I were going
to move down there.

50:06.503 --> 50:09.504
But in a strange way,
it's better.

50:09.506 --> 50:11.506
I'm finally taking
responsibility for my actions.

50:13.175 --> 50:15.110
Making excuses
doesn't change anything.

50:20.116 --> 50:23.518
I'm really sorry about what I
said, the day of your hearing.

50:23.520 --> 50:25.387
I didn't know you were there.

50:25.389 --> 50:26.788
I wasn't thinking about
what I was saying,

50:26.790 --> 50:28.790
I didn't have any idea
of what I was saying.

50:30.526 --> 50:31.760
I'm really sorry.

50:32.595 --> 50:33.762
Lee.

50:38.401 --> 50:39.768
I better go.

51:08.197 --> 51:09.330
Almost ready.

51:09.332 --> 51:10.398
Oh, great.

51:14.837 --> 51:16.371
Looks like we're just in time.

51:16.373 --> 51:17.505
Yeah.

51:17.507 --> 51:18.840
Need help with anything?

51:18.842 --> 51:21.543
Um, so yeah, I need
to run inside.

51:21.545 --> 51:23.111
You better let me handle this.

51:25.114 --> 51:26.381
Has anyone seen Ben?

51:53.642 --> 51:55.410
Lee, would you mind
saying the blessing?

51:57.613 --> 52:00.482
Okay, um...

52:01.817 --> 52:04.419
Dear god, thank you

52:04.787 --> 52:06.121
for...

52:06.489 --> 52:07.689
Um...

52:09.592 --> 52:12.660
God Grant us the Serenity,

52:12.662 --> 52:14.696
to accept the things
we cannot change,

52:14.698 --> 52:17.332
the courage to change
the things we can

52:17.334 --> 52:19.200
and the wisdom
to know the difference.

52:19.802 --> 52:20.869
Amen.

52:20.871 --> 52:22.670
Amen.

52:24.807 --> 52:28.309
So, Ben, what happened
with you and your boyfriend?

52:30.412 --> 52:31.613
It didn't work out.

52:35.151 --> 52:37.886
Why is it that gay
relationships never last long?

52:40.256 --> 52:44.559
Well, it turns out that
George had a wife and kids.

52:44.561 --> 52:47.595
Nothing ruins a gay relationship
faster than a wife and kids.

52:51.267 --> 52:54.569
No, but, you know,
what I mean, I mean...

52:54.571 --> 52:57.872
You guys are always running
around having sex with each other

52:57.874 --> 53:00.308
in public bathrooms,
truck stops.

53:02.444 --> 53:06.614
When straight people have sex
in public places like the...

53:06.616 --> 53:08.917
Backseat of the car
on the beach,

53:08.919 --> 53:11.653
society turns it into a
Norman Rockwell painting.

53:12.621 --> 53:15.190
Well, beaches are romantic.

53:15.192 --> 53:16.691
Truck stops aren't.

53:16.693 --> 53:20.662
Why is it okay for nurses or
teachers to be objects of desire,

53:20.664 --> 53:22.363
but not truck drivers?

53:22.365 --> 53:25.366
It all depends on what
you label as normal.

53:25.368 --> 53:28.536
Are you complaining that
gays have sex in public?

53:28.538 --> 53:30.638
Or do you just not like the
public places they pick?

53:34.710 --> 53:36.711
Um...

53:36.713 --> 53:39.480
I think it's a good thing
that, uh...

53:39.482 --> 53:41.883
You found out about George's
wife and his children.

53:41.885 --> 53:44.586
If he would do that to them,

53:44.588 --> 53:45.653
he'd do it to you.

53:53.596 --> 53:54.729
Thanks for coming.

53:55.664 --> 53:57.632
Yeah, it was a good time.

53:57.634 --> 53:59.968
Damn, I forgot my sunglasses.

53:59.970 --> 54:01.369
Oh.

54:02.938 --> 54:05.807
So, uh, fishing tomorrow?

54:05.809 --> 54:07.475
Absolutely.
All right.

54:09.245 --> 54:10.745
Where are the trash bags?

54:10.747 --> 54:11.846
I'll get 'em.

54:11.848 --> 54:12.914
Thanks.

54:22.591 --> 54:23.925
It was a good day.

54:23.927 --> 54:25.360
Good to see you again.

54:27.429 --> 54:28.496
Yeah.

54:31.033 --> 54:33.568
Look, uh, thanks for what
you said about my hearing.

54:37.506 --> 54:38.606
Really appreciate it.

54:38.608 --> 54:39.674
You're welcome.

54:57.760 --> 54:58.826
I got 'em.

55:04.500 --> 55:05.667
Well, let's go.

55:20.983 --> 55:22.050
Hey.

55:27.423 --> 55:29.324
How are sales?
Did you have a good day?

55:29.326 --> 55:31.059
No.

55:31.061 --> 55:32.927
I'm hoping it picks up soon.

55:34.663 --> 55:36.964
Anyway, I'm too happy to care.

55:38.634 --> 55:39.914
So, did you have fun at Chuck's?

55:40.336 --> 55:41.969
Yeah.

55:41.971 --> 55:43.738
Kept thinking
about that guy, Lee.

55:43.740 --> 55:44.906
I don't know what
to make of him.

55:44.908 --> 55:46.341
What do you mean?

55:46.343 --> 55:48.676
I mean, he's not just
like a typical loser,

55:48.678 --> 55:48.676
he's like more complicated
than that.

55:48.678 --> 55:52.747
Why do you feel like you have
to put him into a category?

55:52.749 --> 55:55.450
I'm not putting him
into a category.

55:55.452 --> 55:59.354
But he is an alcoholic and a felon, you
don't just ignore something like that.

55:59.356 --> 56:01.823
Well, you don't have
to ignore it, but...

56:01.825 --> 56:04.492
You don't have to define
him by it either.

56:04.494 --> 56:07.128
I hope I'm not defined by the
worst thing that I had ever done.

56:15.971 --> 56:18.005
Chuck's cabin was rustic.

56:18.007 --> 56:19.640
Come on out with it.

56:19.642 --> 56:20.808
What do you wanna say?

56:21.777 --> 56:24.579
Do you realize that Chuck makes

56:24.581 --> 56:26.814
less than $12,000 a year?

56:26.816 --> 56:28.816
I haven't analyzed it that much,

56:28.818 --> 56:30.918
well, don't you think
maybe you should?

56:30.920 --> 56:33.788
Well, I do all right, I get by.

56:33.790 --> 56:37.825
Have you thought about living in that
two room cabin with no running water?

56:37.827 --> 56:41.095
I like Chuck, but he doesn't
care about earning a living.

56:41.097 --> 56:43.798
He wants to live in the
woods away from everyone.

56:43.800 --> 56:46.634
You know you two don't
have that much in common.

56:46.636 --> 56:49.871
And he's not gonna turn
into someone else later.

56:49.873 --> 56:52.707
Easy to romanticize everything
now, when you're all infatuated,

56:52.709 --> 56:54.609
but what about
five years from now

56:54.611 --> 56:57.612
when you can't pay the bills and
you're in a cabin with no water

56:57.614 --> 57:00.748
and he's on a week long hike with his
buddies. Have you thought about that?

57:01.717 --> 57:03.050
Wouldn't be like that.

57:03.052 --> 57:04.986
It'd be just like that.

57:05.954 --> 57:07.155
So, what are you saying?

57:08.457 --> 57:10.057
I don't know.

57:10.059 --> 57:13.161
I'm just saying, maybe you should
think about things like that.

58:10.719 --> 58:11.953
Morning.

58:12.888 --> 58:13.955
Hey.

58:17.726 --> 58:21.829
This is a little awkward, um, you remember
when I ran into you at Chuck's cabin?

58:21.831 --> 58:24.131
Right after that,
I, uh, find your journal.

58:25.701 --> 58:28.069
You know, I was wondering
where I lost that.

58:28.071 --> 58:30.938
Yeah and then I meant it to
give it back to you, but, um...

58:30.940 --> 58:34.008
For some reason, I didn't think I should
give it back to you in front of Cathy.

58:34.010 --> 58:36.744
I mean I didn't read or anything, so I
don't even know if it talks about her,

58:36.746 --> 58:39.180
but I imagine since
it's a journal.

58:39.182 --> 58:41.549
And then, I forgot I had it.

58:41.551 --> 58:43.084
And then, when I
remembered when I had it,

58:43.086 --> 58:45.052
then I thought that you
would think I just went...

58:46.522 --> 58:49.056
But I didn't read it
or anything.

58:49.058 --> 58:52.660
But I read a little bit of
it, but nothing bad, just...

58:52.662 --> 58:54.028
You know, personal stuff.

58:56.532 --> 58:58.165
Anyway, um, there it is.

59:00.769 --> 59:02.203
Just some personal stuff.

59:03.105 --> 59:04.572
Yeah, just...

59:06.642 --> 59:08.943
It must be a guy being
too hard on himself.

59:16.051 --> 59:18.219
I'm thinking about going
hiking, later today.

59:20.956 --> 59:22.790
Where are you gonna go?

59:22.792 --> 59:24.759
Up to Wolverine Ridge.

59:24.761 --> 59:27.194
Wolverine Ridge, isn't
that past green cove?

59:27.196 --> 59:28.896
Yeah. Yeah, I
haven't been there.

59:34.903 --> 59:37.263
Well, I could get my car and
then I'd follow you over there.

59:38.941 --> 59:40.041
That sounds like a plan.

59:40.776 --> 59:41.909
Cool.

01:00:18.347 --> 01:00:20.915
So, when did you start drinking?

01:00:20.917 --> 01:00:23.351
I don't know...
High school, I guess...

01:00:26.054 --> 01:00:28.155
My dad's an alcoholic.

01:00:28.157 --> 01:00:30.958
He'd go to the office
everyday, but...

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:33.160
He'd get home at five,
usually passed out by seven.

01:00:34.663 --> 01:00:36.030
Sleep for two hours.

01:00:38.133 --> 01:00:40.901
Throw up, eat something,
get drunk again.

01:00:43.171 --> 01:00:45.640
He was angry, mean.

01:00:46.375 --> 01:00:49.176
Not physically,
but psychologically.

01:00:50.746 --> 01:00:53.848
Our mother, spent her time

01:00:53.850 --> 01:00:55.650
pretending
there wasn't a problem.

01:00:55.652 --> 01:00:57.785
I just stayed in my room
a lot, the door shut.

01:01:00.322 --> 01:01:01.922
Even call me recluse.

01:01:02.824 --> 01:01:04.725
Sissy.

01:01:04.727 --> 01:01:08.295
I never understood
the demons he was fighting.

01:01:08.297 --> 01:01:10.164
I don't think he
understands 'em either.

01:01:10.166 --> 01:01:12.099
I know that now, but...

01:01:12.101 --> 01:01:13.901
When I was 13, I just hated him.

01:01:17.773 --> 01:01:19.206
So, why do you drink?

01:01:19.208 --> 01:01:20.441
Hell, I don't know.

01:01:24.046 --> 01:01:26.313
Like you said, demons.

01:01:29.885 --> 01:01:31.986
There's things about me I hate.

01:01:33.321 --> 01:01:34.955
Things I can't understand.

01:01:48.003 --> 01:01:49.170
It's granite.

01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:53.240
It's all over the place up here.

01:01:54.910 --> 01:01:57.211
How do you know that?

01:01:57.213 --> 01:01:59.246
Studied geology before I
dropped out of college.

01:02:06.188 --> 01:02:08.155
We should head back.

01:02:43.759 --> 01:02:44.892
Have a good one.

01:02:44.894 --> 01:02:46.393
You want to get
something to eat?

01:02:51.032 --> 01:02:52.272
Where do you think about going?

01:02:53.268 --> 01:02:55.336
I don't care...
The diner.

01:03:01.009 --> 01:03:02.076
All right.

01:03:04.212 --> 01:03:05.312
I'll see you there.

01:03:21.897 --> 01:03:22.963
I gotta go.

01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:26.801
Okay, it's all right.

01:03:29.905 --> 01:03:31.172
I had a good time.

01:04:15.517 --> 01:04:16.917
Hi, honey.

01:04:16.919 --> 01:04:17.985
Hi.

01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:26.994
He's still not here?

01:04:26.996 --> 01:04:28.262
No.

01:04:28.264 --> 01:04:29.430
That's unusual.

01:04:31.299 --> 01:04:34.101
Guess he got held up somewhere.

01:04:34.103 --> 01:04:37.004
I'm gonna go finish these,
get them delivered.

01:04:48.483 --> 01:04:50.150
Sorry for standing you up.

01:04:54.589 --> 01:04:56.523
What's wrong?
You okay?

01:04:58.560 --> 01:05:00.327
Jane told me,
it isn't working out.

01:05:00.329 --> 01:05:01.462
Why did she say that?

01:05:01.464 --> 01:05:02.997
She came up here last night.

01:05:04.499 --> 01:05:05.566
Why?

01:05:06.167 --> 01:05:07.301
She didn't say.

01:05:12.608 --> 01:05:16.176
Trying to act like my breath
had been knocked out of me.

01:05:17.279 --> 01:05:18.979
I don't understand.

01:05:18.981 --> 01:05:21.348
I've been sitting here all day.

01:05:21.350 --> 01:05:23.584
Trying to convince myself
that it doesn't matter.

01:05:23.586 --> 01:05:26.353
That it wouldn't have
worked anyway.

01:05:26.355 --> 01:05:28.315
Couldn't believe she actually
had feelings for me.

01:05:29.090 --> 01:05:30.190
I guess she didn't.

01:05:34.362 --> 01:05:36.063
I just can't stop
thinking about her.

01:06:45.467 --> 01:06:47.735
Hello, can I help you?

01:06:47.737 --> 01:06:51.605
Yeah, my name's Lee Darcy,
I'm here to see Ben Bennett.

01:06:51.607 --> 01:06:53.340
Is he expecting you?

01:06:53.342 --> 01:06:55.209
No.

01:06:55.211 --> 01:06:58.145
Well, he's in a conference right
now, but I think he'll be out soon.

01:06:58.147 --> 01:06:59.787
You can have a seat
if you'd like to wait.

01:07:00.448 --> 01:07:01.515
Thank you.

01:07:20.301 --> 01:07:22.269
I'm sorry I just dropped
in on you like this.

01:07:22.271 --> 01:07:25.239
I just really needed
someone to talk to.

01:07:25.241 --> 01:07:29.743
I know. It's hard right now, but
in the end you'll see. All right?

01:07:29.745 --> 01:07:34.681
Chuck's a great guy, but he's never
going to make anything of himself.

01:07:34.683 --> 01:07:36.283
You'll just have
to keep that in mind.

01:07:38.420 --> 01:07:39.520
I know.

01:07:50.665 --> 01:07:52.299
I'll call you, okay?

01:08:01.676 --> 01:08:04.745
Ben,
Lee Darcy is here to see you.

01:08:07.415 --> 01:08:12.586
Came by to see if you could help me figure
out why Jane decided to break up with Chuck.

01:08:14.656 --> 01:08:16.223
Guess I got my answer.

01:08:19.094 --> 01:08:20.794
My first impressions
of you were right.

01:08:22.229 --> 01:08:24.131
You're just another
pretentious faggot.

01:08:45.453 --> 01:08:47.488
Oh, hi, Ben.

01:08:47.490 --> 01:08:50.390
Where are they,
the criminal files?

01:08:50.392 --> 01:08:51.658
Uh, they're under the counter.

01:09:32.634 --> 01:09:34.434
So, what's this about?

01:09:36.337 --> 01:09:39.406
I understand that you witnessed
an incident between Lee Darcy

01:09:39.408 --> 01:09:40.640
and his girlfriend, Cathy?

01:09:44.379 --> 01:09:47.346
Yes, I did.

01:09:47.349 --> 01:09:50.617
According to the court file, you said
that Lee said he was gonna kill her

01:09:50.618 --> 01:09:51.685
and then he pushed her.

01:09:52.921 --> 01:09:55.322
Well, I never said
I saw him push her.

01:09:55.324 --> 01:09:58.492
I said he must've pushed her,
because I heard them arguing,

01:09:58.494 --> 01:09:59.626
and she fell and hit her head.

01:09:59.628 --> 01:10:02.563
So, he must've pushed her.

01:10:02.565 --> 01:10:06.233
Did you tell the police officer
that he said he was gonna kill her?

01:10:15.343 --> 01:10:16.810
Yes, I said that.

01:10:21.349 --> 01:10:23.217
Is that what you heard?

01:10:23.219 --> 01:10:25.819
What's this about?
I thought this was over.

01:10:25.821 --> 01:10:27.888
I'm just looking into it,
for a friend of Lee's.

01:10:30.291 --> 01:10:31.758
Well...

01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:36.330
Suppose I didn't
exactly hear those words...

01:10:36.332 --> 01:10:38.799
I mean, suppose the...

01:10:38.801 --> 01:10:42.536
Statement I gave
wasn't completely accurate.

01:10:42.538 --> 01:10:44.698
I could get into a lot of
trouble for that, couldn't I?

01:10:45.773 --> 01:10:48.508
Yes.

01:10:48.510 --> 01:10:51.350
But you do recognize that Lee doesn't
remember what happened that night.

01:10:53.381 --> 01:10:55.816
His felony conviction is based
solely on your testimony.

01:10:57.986 --> 01:11:00.621
Would it make a difference if it
turns out I went to Lee's attorney

01:11:00.623 --> 01:11:02.956
about it and he ignored me?

01:11:04.626 --> 01:11:05.692
It might.

01:11:11.332 --> 01:11:15.269
Let me guess, you're back on
the court-appointed list?

01:11:15.271 --> 01:11:17.571
Do you remember the case you
had when you first got here?

01:11:17.573 --> 01:11:20.774
Yeah, what was her name, Diane?
I was certain she was innocent.

01:11:22.677 --> 01:11:24.044
That was 12 years ago.

01:11:24.946 --> 01:11:26.947
So, what's up?

01:11:26.949 --> 01:11:29.349
You prosecuted a guy
named Lee Darcy,

01:11:29.351 --> 01:11:31.551
for aggravated malicious
wounding.

01:11:31.553 --> 01:11:34.621
And Lee was charged with a felony
based on a testimony of a neighbor,

01:11:34.623 --> 01:11:36.857
who said that Lee threatened
to kill his girlfriend.

01:11:36.859 --> 01:11:38.025
Yeah, I remember it.

01:11:39.027 --> 01:11:40.994
Well, there's a possibility...

01:11:40.996 --> 01:11:44.298
That that neighbor would
recant her statement.

01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:46.433
So, that happens all the time,

01:11:46.435 --> 01:11:49.703
there's not really anything
to be done about that.

01:11:49.705 --> 01:11:53.407
What if the neighbor told Lee's
attorney her testimony was false?

01:11:54.042 --> 01:11:55.776
And, uh...

01:11:55.778 --> 01:11:57.611
The attorney admitted
that to me?

01:11:57.613 --> 01:11:59.813
Well, that's
a different story, but...

01:11:59.815 --> 01:12:02.616
Why doesn't Darcy's attorney
just reopen the case?

01:12:03.084 --> 01:12:04.584
Who is his attorney?

01:12:05.553 --> 01:12:06.687
George Wickham.

01:12:09.424 --> 01:12:10.490
Hmmm.

01:12:11.793 --> 01:12:14.628
Well, I think we might've
talked more about this.

01:12:23.738 --> 01:12:24.805
Can I help you?

01:12:25.973 --> 01:12:29.009
Ben Bennett, I'm here
to see, George Wickham.

01:12:29.011 --> 01:12:31.678
You just wait in here. He'll
be here in just a moment.

01:12:43.391 --> 01:12:44.558
Ben.

01:12:44.959 --> 01:12:46.660
Great to see you.

01:12:48.996 --> 01:12:50.497
Step outside.

01:12:53.568 --> 01:12:54.935
Look, I understand
why you're mad.

01:12:54.937 --> 01:12:57.097
I should've leveled with you
about my situation, but...

01:12:57.605 --> 01:12:59.773
I really fell hard for you.

01:12:59.775 --> 01:13:03.877
I was afraid you wouldn't see
me under those circumstances.

01:13:03.879 --> 01:13:06.546
Honestly, I'm hoping you're
here to give us another chance.

01:13:06.548 --> 01:13:08.882
You are some piece
of work, aren't you?

01:13:08.884 --> 01:13:13.887
You refer to your wife
and children as a situation?

01:13:13.889 --> 01:13:15.929
That little boy's gonna be
so proud of you, one day.

01:13:17.125 --> 01:13:18.592
So, why are you here?

01:13:22.430 --> 01:13:25.132
You're gonna file a writ of
actual innocence for Lee Darcy.

01:13:25.134 --> 01:13:26.400
What?

01:13:27.168 --> 01:13:28.602
Lee Darcy?

01:13:29.003 --> 01:13:30.504
Why would I do that?

01:13:31.105 --> 01:13:32.973
It's pretty simple.

01:13:32.975 --> 01:13:36.576
Lee's neighbor told you her testimony
was false. You ignored her.

01:13:36.578 --> 01:13:38.145
You breached your duty
to defend Lee,

01:13:38.147 --> 01:13:40.614
because you see him as
nothing more than a thief.

01:13:40.616 --> 01:13:42.983
You told me all this while
screwing around on your wife,

01:13:42.985 --> 01:13:45.752
you lied to her, you lied to me.

01:13:45.754 --> 01:13:48.922
You stabbed the commonwealth
attorney in the back.

01:13:48.924 --> 01:13:51.458
Now, the neighbor's going
to testify against you.

01:13:51.460 --> 01:13:53.760
The commonwealth is going
to give her immunity

01:13:53.762 --> 01:13:55.729
and I'll just report you
to the state bar.

01:13:56.931 --> 01:13:58.899
If you actually do
the right thing now.

01:13:58.901 --> 01:14:00.801
I only lose
your license for a year.

01:14:00.803 --> 01:14:03.036
Otherwise, I'll make sure you
never practice law again.

01:14:07.175 --> 01:14:09.142
Lee came to see me.

01:14:09.144 --> 01:14:10.577
Yeah, about what?

01:14:11.579 --> 01:14:12.846
About Chuck.

01:14:12.848 --> 01:14:14.114
Chuck?

01:14:14.116 --> 01:14:15.649
What'd he say?

01:14:16.017 --> 01:14:17.217
Not much.

01:14:18.786 --> 01:14:20.020
Um, he didn't have to.

01:14:21.556 --> 01:14:23.790
Basically,
Chuck is broken hearted.

01:14:23.792 --> 01:14:26.660
And I'm a pretentious queer who
should've minded his own business.

01:14:27.728 --> 01:14:29.629
He's right.

01:14:29.631 --> 01:14:32.199
But what you said,
made a lot of sense.

01:14:32.201 --> 01:14:34.167
No, it really doesn't, Jane.

01:14:36.704 --> 01:14:39.172
Look, I judged Chuck
based on his paycheck.

01:14:39.174 --> 01:14:41.041
I concluded
he's wasting his life.

01:14:41.976 --> 01:14:43.710
The truth is, what am I doing?

01:14:45.780 --> 01:14:49.082
There was this guy in school
that had a bumper sticker that,

01:14:49.084 --> 01:14:51.485
"guy who dies
with the most toys, wins."

01:14:53.087 --> 01:14:55.127
That's what I'm doing,
that's my plan for happiness.

01:14:56.691 --> 01:14:59.726
Sounds so pathetic
to say it out loud.

01:14:59.728 --> 01:15:01.495
What are you talking about?

01:15:07.502 --> 01:15:08.635
I'm talking about Chuck.

01:15:10.104 --> 01:15:11.204
He loves you.

01:15:12.773 --> 01:15:13.907
You love him.

01:15:14.976 --> 01:15:16.977
How often does that happen?

01:15:19.247 --> 01:15:21.781
Look, I'm an idiot.

01:15:31.526 --> 01:15:33.126
You were right about one thing.

01:15:34.729 --> 01:15:37.764
You are an idiot.

01:15:53.314 --> 01:15:55.015
Let's go hike
to top of the Ridge.

01:15:56.584 --> 01:15:58.051
Yeah, I appreciate you
checking on me,

01:15:58.053 --> 01:15:59.953
but I don't feel like
doing anything.

01:15:59.955 --> 01:16:02.822
I know I need to snap out of this,
but it's going to take some time.

01:16:05.159 --> 01:16:06.693
You expecting anybody?

01:16:11.132 --> 01:16:12.632
It's Jane.

01:16:16.003 --> 01:16:17.070
How do I look?

01:16:18.606 --> 01:16:19.940
You look like hammered shit.

01:16:22.878 --> 01:16:24.177
You look fine, man.

01:16:25.346 --> 01:16:26.646
Hey.

01:16:27.582 --> 01:16:28.682
Hey.

01:16:30.851 --> 01:16:32.319
You'll be okay.

01:16:33.354 --> 01:16:35.355
I'm gonna get going.

01:16:35.357 --> 01:16:36.856
Give you a call tomorrow, Chuck.

01:16:36.858 --> 01:16:37.924
Okay.

01:16:42.063 --> 01:16:43.129
Hey.

01:16:43.331 --> 01:16:44.598
Hey.

01:16:52.039 --> 01:16:54.307
Just came by
to tell you, I'm sorry.

01:17:20.968 --> 01:17:22.636
What is it?

01:17:22.638 --> 01:17:23.770
I don't know.

01:17:24.739 --> 01:17:26.006
Seems to be a notice.

01:17:27.875 --> 01:17:30.276
There's a hearing
on my case on Tuesday.

01:17:35.416 --> 01:17:37.183
I thought your case was over.

01:17:42.289 --> 01:17:44.124
So, your testimony is that...

01:17:44.126 --> 01:17:47.127
Lee Darcy did not threaten
to kill Cathy Burge.

01:17:47.129 --> 01:17:47.127
That is correct.

01:17:47.129 --> 01:17:51.398
And you informed, Mr. Wickham of
this, more than five months ago?

01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:52.666
Yes.

01:17:53.300 --> 01:17:54.401
You may go.

01:18:01.776 --> 01:18:03.677
Based on the evidence presented,

01:18:03.679 --> 01:18:06.346
the court dismisses
its previous order

01:18:06.348 --> 01:18:09.082
and the felony conviction
of Lee Darcy is vacated.

01:18:09.850 --> 01:18:11.217
We stand adjourned.

01:18:12.119 --> 01:18:13.453
All rise.

01:18:14.355 --> 01:18:16.322
Mr. Wickham.

01:18:16.324 --> 01:18:20.360
I anticipate you'll have some
explaining to do to the state bar.

01:18:20.362 --> 01:18:22.429
I suggest you find
a good attorney.

01:18:22.431 --> 01:18:24.731
One who actually
cares about their clients.

01:18:31.806 --> 01:18:33.139
What just happened?

01:18:33.141 --> 01:18:36.242
Congratulations,
court cleared your record.

01:18:38.245 --> 01:18:39.446
Thank you.

01:18:40.047 --> 01:18:41.781
Save it.

01:18:41.783 --> 01:18:44.851
Ben Bennett moved heaven and
earth for your worthless ass.

01:18:51.325 --> 01:18:53.159
He must really
have it bad for you.

01:19:31.065 --> 01:19:32.899
Ben...

01:19:32.901 --> 01:19:35.435
Where in the hell were you?

01:19:35.936 --> 01:19:37.937
I knew it.

01:19:37.939 --> 01:19:42.008
Didn't I tell you, you missed the
reception to sit around and push papers?

01:19:42.010 --> 01:19:43.510
Pathetic.

01:19:43.512 --> 01:19:45.979
Why didn't you tell us
you weren't coming?

01:19:45.981 --> 01:19:48.014
Rainey Daniels was there.

01:19:48.016 --> 01:19:49.516
He's hotter than a firecracker,

01:19:49.518 --> 01:19:51.017
pow, pack-a-pow.

01:19:52.386 --> 01:19:54.521
Don't waste your time,
Ben isn't interested.

01:19:54.523 --> 01:19:56.890
Ben's never gonna fall
in love again, are you Ben?

01:20:00.895 --> 01:20:02.328
What is it?

01:20:02.330 --> 01:20:03.429
What's wrong?

01:20:16.076 --> 01:20:17.544
You must've dropped this.

01:20:27.521 --> 01:20:29.522
Thought I'd catch you
before you went in.

01:20:30.324 --> 01:20:31.491
You're up early.

01:20:32.193 --> 01:20:33.293
I still have work.

01:20:34.528 --> 01:20:35.595
Right.

01:20:37.431 --> 01:20:42.468
Look, I'm not really good
at this, um...

01:20:42.470 --> 01:20:44.838
Really appreciate what you did
for me at the courthouse.

01:20:46.540 --> 01:20:47.941
You're welcome.

01:20:50.311 --> 01:20:51.444
Also...

01:20:53.480 --> 01:20:55.548
I'm really sorry
about what I said

01:20:55.550 --> 01:20:57.116
at your office, the other day.

01:20:58.152 --> 01:20:59.219
It's all right.

01:21:02.456 --> 01:21:03.623
So, what happens now?

01:21:07.161 --> 01:21:08.394
Um...

01:21:11.232 --> 01:21:13.399
My buddy called from Atlanta,

01:21:13.401 --> 01:21:15.134
that job is still available.

01:21:16.503 --> 01:21:19.405
I don't have a record now,
so I can leave the state.

01:21:19.407 --> 01:21:21.007
He says it starts next Monday.

01:21:25.613 --> 01:21:28.548
So, I guess I won't be
seeing much of you.

01:21:33.921 --> 01:21:37.490
Yeah, I'm gonna...
I should get back.

01:23:01.241 --> 01:23:04.110
There's a Cathy Burge
here to see you.

01:23:05.612 --> 01:23:06.713
Thanks.

01:23:20.094 --> 01:23:21.227
Hello.

01:23:24.732 --> 01:23:28.201
I guess all these books are
supposed to show how smart you are.

01:23:30.104 --> 01:23:32.171
Probably so.

01:23:32.173 --> 01:23:33.573
Is there something
I can do for you?

01:23:35.576 --> 01:23:38.444
No, is there something
I can do for you?

01:23:38.446 --> 01:23:40.713
Don't pretend you don't
know why I'm here.

01:23:40.715 --> 01:23:43.249
I honestly have no idea.

01:23:43.251 --> 01:23:46.285
I know what you're doing. I
know exactly what you're doing.

01:23:46.653 --> 01:23:48.187
What am I doing?

01:23:49.223 --> 01:23:51.224
You don't think I've noticed?

01:23:51.226 --> 01:23:53.259
Why you been working on Lee?

01:23:53.261 --> 01:23:55.328
Trying to worm
your way into his life?

01:23:55.330 --> 01:23:58.664
I mean, it's been disgusting to
watch the little love-sick queer

01:23:58.666 --> 01:24:00.466
make a fool out of himself.

01:24:04.638 --> 01:24:06.272
What do you want?

01:24:06.274 --> 01:24:08.174
I want you to leave Lee alone.

01:24:08.176 --> 01:24:10.410
I want you stay away
from my boyfriend!

01:24:21.722 --> 01:24:23.489
This is ridiculous.

01:24:25.292 --> 01:24:28.428
The very idea of a
red-blooded guy like Lee

01:24:28.430 --> 01:24:31.297
having any interest
in a sissy boy like you.

01:24:33.167 --> 01:24:34.567
If you believe
it's so ridiculous,

01:24:34.569 --> 01:24:36.202
I wonder why
you bothered coming here.

01:24:38.105 --> 01:24:40.173
Oh, honey, trust me.

01:24:40.175 --> 01:24:42.642
Lee isn't a queer.

01:24:42.644 --> 01:24:45.411
Does he really think
you give a shit about him?

01:24:47.181 --> 01:24:50.183
You think you can brainwash him
just like those Aa people?

01:24:50.185 --> 01:24:51.784
They acted like
they cared about him.

01:24:51.786 --> 01:24:54.353
Got him to think all kinds
of crazy things, too.

01:24:55.656 --> 01:24:58.858
You're doing
the exact same thing.

01:24:58.860 --> 01:25:02.195
I know it was you that got
Lee's record cleared, somehow.

01:25:02.197 --> 01:25:04.197
Lee told me you did it.

01:25:04.199 --> 01:25:06.499
I did it. I'm glad
I was able to help him.

01:25:06.501 --> 01:25:08.167
Help him?

01:25:08.169 --> 01:25:10.536
Is that what you call it?

01:25:10.538 --> 01:25:13.239
Oh, I know what you're up to,
even if he doesn't see it yet.

01:25:13.807 --> 01:25:15.274
What am I up to?

01:25:15.276 --> 01:25:16.876
Brainwashing him

01:25:16.878 --> 01:25:20.246
into not taking
that job in Atlanta.

01:25:20.248 --> 01:25:24.484
Making him think
he has feelings for you.

01:25:24.486 --> 01:25:28.221
Making him think he's some
kind of fag like you.

01:25:28.822 --> 01:25:30.790
Well, he's not!

01:25:30.792 --> 01:25:33.593
So, your little plan isn't going
to work, I'm going to see to that.

01:25:35.329 --> 01:25:36.796
You said he has feelings for me?

01:25:38.765 --> 01:25:39.866
Go to hell.

01:27:52.499 --> 01:27:53.566
Hey.

01:28:07.381 --> 01:28:08.614
It's a great day for a hike.

01:28:09.483 --> 01:28:11.450
Yeah, it is.

01:28:11.452 --> 01:28:13.652
Cathy said you're not going
to take that job in Atlanta.

01:28:14.721 --> 01:28:15.955
That's right.

01:28:15.957 --> 01:28:17.023
Why?

01:28:18.025 --> 01:28:19.392
I don't know.

01:28:20.661 --> 01:28:23.529
That's not much of an answer.

01:28:23.531 --> 01:28:25.931
Look, I didn't mean to cause
problems for you and Cathy.

01:28:28.368 --> 01:28:30.069
You didn't.

01:28:30.071 --> 01:28:32.038
We're not together, but
it's not because of you.

01:28:33.640 --> 01:28:34.940
She came to the office.

01:28:34.942 --> 01:28:36.809
Um, she was pretty upset.

01:28:37.911 --> 01:28:39.679
Yeah, I know about that.

01:28:39.681 --> 01:28:41.681
And she was very upset.

01:28:46.353 --> 01:28:47.586
She accused me of...

01:28:48.822 --> 01:28:50.456
Trying to take you
away from her.

01:28:53.393 --> 01:28:54.527
That's crazy.

01:28:54.529 --> 01:28:55.594
Is it?

01:28:55.929 --> 01:28:56.996
Yeah.

01:29:00.067 --> 01:29:01.834
I think you misread signals

01:29:01.836 --> 01:29:02.968
or something.

01:29:04.404 --> 01:29:06.072
Cathy said you had
feelings for me.

01:29:07.107 --> 01:29:08.407
She's wrong.

01:29:10.110 --> 01:29:11.477
Those are her issues.

01:29:11.945 --> 01:29:13.346
I'm not gay.

01:29:14.715 --> 01:29:16.615
I'm just trying
to be nice to you,

01:29:16.617 --> 01:29:18.951
because you helped me out,
that's all.

01:29:20.887 --> 01:29:22.722
I don't wanna talk
about this anymore.

01:29:28.829 --> 01:29:29.929
I love you.

01:29:29.931 --> 01:29:31.731
Will you just stop it?

01:29:31.733 --> 01:29:32.965
I'm not like that!

01:29:34.501 --> 01:29:35.601
I'm not like you.

01:29:46.413 --> 01:29:47.713
I'm sorry.

01:29:49.716 --> 01:29:50.883
I've gotta go.
