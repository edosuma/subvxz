[harmonica music]

00:11.712 --> 00:14.648
Come on now, Jackie,
it's been like two hours.

00:14.748 --> 00:15.649
When are we gonna eat?

00:15.749 --> 00:16.917
Be ready in a minute.

00:17.017 --> 00:18.086
[laughter]

00:18.186 --> 00:19.820
Well, can me and
Dan have something

00:19.920 --> 00:20.854
to hold us while we're waiting?

00:20.954 --> 00:23.591
You know, like a
cracker or a ham?

00:23.691 --> 00:24.492
[laughter]

00:24.592 --> 00:25.793
No.

00:25.893 --> 00:27.361
It'll ruin your appetite.

00:27.461 --> 00:29.230
God, Roseanne, I'm
in here slaving

00:29.330 --> 00:31.665
away, trying to make you guys
a beautiful gourmet dinner.

00:31.765 --> 00:34.068
You think you can
wait one minute?

00:34.168 --> 00:36.570
OK.

00:36.670 --> 00:38.038
One Mississippi,
two Mississippi.

00:38.139 --> 00:38.939
[laughter]

00:39.039 --> 00:40.274
Just get out.

00:40.374 --> 00:41.442
Fine.

00:41.542 --> 00:43.544
I hope DJ left some
sugar puffs in the couch.

00:43.644 --> 00:44.912
[laughter]

00:45.012 --> 00:45.813
When?

00:45.913 --> 00:47.981
One more minute, she said.

00:48.082 --> 00:50.518
Well you know she's
a liar, Roseanne.

00:50.618 --> 00:51.885
Well she's trying
to be nice, Dan.

00:51.985 --> 00:53.787
I'm afraid we're just gonna
have to sit here and take it.

00:53.887 --> 00:54.988
Never gonna eat.
Never gonna eat.

00:55.089 --> 00:55.856
We're never gonna eat.
We're never gonna eat.

00:55.956 --> 00:56.890
We're never gonna eat.

00:56.990 --> 00:58.792
Come on, just get
a hold yourself now.

00:58.892 --> 01:00.161
We just have to get
our minds off food,

01:00.261 --> 01:01.429
and we think of something else.

01:01.529 --> 01:02.730
Oh, I know.

01:02.830 --> 01:04.398
I think I might be getting
my Christmas bonus tomorrow.

01:04.498 --> 01:05.533
I hope it's spaghetti.

01:05.633 --> 01:07.268
[laughter]

01:07.368 --> 01:09.103
Where do you keep your spices?

01:09.203 --> 01:10.171
In the salt shaker.

01:10.271 --> 01:12.039
[laughter]

01:13.541 --> 01:15.008
OK.

01:15.109 --> 01:17.378
And is Darlene
gonna eat with us?

01:17.478 --> 01:19.513
No, she usually just
fixes herself a sandwich

01:19.613 --> 01:20.948
and eats it up in her room.

01:21.048 --> 01:21.982
Oh.

01:22.082 --> 01:23.284
I hope I didn't make too much.

01:23.384 --> 01:24.452
No, you can't make too much.

01:24.552 --> 01:26.354
Just scamper on back in
there and start cooking.

01:26.454 --> 01:27.688
OK.
Okey doke.

01:27.788 --> 01:28.589
[laughter]

01:28.689 --> 01:29.990
Oh, that reminds me.

01:30.090 --> 01:32.826
Leon told me to ask you if you
want to be Santa at the mall.

01:32.926 --> 01:34.462
Because he's in
charge of hiring,

01:34.562 --> 01:36.564
and it pays $10 an hour.

01:36.664 --> 01:38.632
A little late to be
hiring Santas, isn't it?

01:38.732 --> 01:41.101
Well, you know,
the last guy got bit,

01:41.202 --> 01:42.936
and so he had to go
get a tetanus shot.

01:43.036 --> 01:43.837
[laughter]

01:43.937 --> 01:45.539
Well, that's very tempting.

01:45.639 --> 01:47.040
Oh that wouldn't
happen to you, Dan,

01:47.141 --> 01:48.709
you're really good with kids.

01:48.809 --> 01:50.110
Not ours, but other people's.

01:50.211 --> 01:51.545
[laughter]

01:51.645 --> 01:54.615
I got a shop to run.

01:54.715 --> 01:55.516
Hey.

01:55.616 --> 01:56.817
DAN: Darlene.

01:56.917 --> 01:58.419
Very good.

01:58.519 --> 02:01.589
We thought you were
upstairs, rotting in your room.

02:01.689 --> 02:03.391
Sorry to disappoint you.

02:03.491 --> 02:04.692
DAN: Where were you?

02:04.792 --> 02:06.160
I was out.

02:06.260 --> 02:07.094
Where?

02:07.195 --> 02:08.162
With a friend.

02:08.262 --> 02:09.096
Oh, do we know her?

02:09.197 --> 02:09.997
No.

02:10.097 --> 02:10.998
Well what's her name?

02:11.098 --> 02:11.899
Karen, OK?

02:11.999 --> 02:13.301
God.

02:13.401 --> 02:15.102
I mean, do I have to account to
you guys for everybody I know

02:15.203 --> 02:16.704
and everything I do?

02:16.804 --> 02:20.408
Why don't you just get your own
damn life and stay out of mine?

02:20.508 --> 02:22.009
Did you hear what
she just said to us?

02:22.109 --> 02:22.976
Yeah.

02:23.076 --> 02:24.278
She's finally got a friend!

02:24.378 --> 02:26.547
[laughter]

02:26.647 --> 02:28.816
And her name is Karen.

02:28.916 --> 02:29.717
Karen.

02:29.817 --> 02:31.685
- Ah, ha, ha.
- Hi, Karen.

02:31.785 --> 02:34.322
Come on in, Karen.
Darlene's upstairs, Karen.

02:34.422 --> 02:35.689
Love your nose ring, Karen.

02:35.789 --> 02:37.525
[laughter]

02:37.625 --> 02:39.693
Say, are you naturally
bald on one side of your head

02:39.793 --> 02:42.129
there, Karen?
[laughter]

02:42.230 --> 02:43.163
Hold your gun for you, Karen?

02:43.264 --> 02:44.498
[laughter]

02:44.598 --> 02:45.633
JACKIE: It's not ready yet.

02:45.733 --> 02:46.634
ROSEANNE: Oh, yes it is.

02:46.734 --> 02:47.601
DAN: You're done.

02:47.701 --> 02:50.103
[theme music]

03:28.876 --> 03:30.778
[laughing]

03:30.878 --> 03:33.247
[music playing]

03:35.349 --> 03:37.251
Well, here you go, ladies.

03:37.351 --> 03:38.419
Bonus time.

03:38.519 --> 03:40.888
It's Just Rodbell's
little way of saying,

03:40.988 --> 03:42.189
yeah, you work here too.

03:42.290 --> 03:43.657
[laughter]

03:44.692 --> 03:46.059
I thought we
were getting cash.

03:46.159 --> 03:47.961
A popular misconception.

03:48.061 --> 03:48.862
Merry Christmas.

03:48.962 --> 03:50.298
This is gonna suck.

03:50.398 --> 03:51.332
And a happy new year.

03:51.432 --> 03:53.066
[laughter]

03:53.166 --> 03:55.936
A Rodbell's coffee mug?

03:56.036 --> 03:58.105
You're right, that does suck.

03:58.205 --> 03:59.573
What'd you get, Leon?

03:59.673 --> 04:01.509
Oh, cash again.

04:01.609 --> 04:02.743
[laughter]

04:03.744 --> 04:04.712
I don't believe this.

04:04.812 --> 04:06.013
What did you get, Walter?

04:06.113 --> 04:07.815
I don't know,
and I don't care.

04:07.915 --> 04:10.384
I'm not opening it on principle,
because this whole Christmas

04:10.484 --> 04:12.520
thing is way out of hand.

04:12.620 --> 04:13.621
Here we go.

04:13.721 --> 04:14.655
It's unbelievable.

04:14.755 --> 04:16.757
It's not about peace
on earth anymore.

04:16.857 --> 04:18.025
It's not about God.

04:18.125 --> 04:20.728
It's about-- it's about
buying grandma a clock radio,

04:20.828 --> 04:23.196
even though she doesn't need
it, just because she sent you

04:23.297 --> 04:26.534
a cheese basket, which you
gave to the mailman, who

04:26.634 --> 04:27.535
really wanted scotch.

04:27.635 --> 04:29.002
[laughter]

04:30.037 --> 04:31.204
I think we found
our Santa Claus.

04:31.305 --> 04:32.773
[laughter]

04:32.873 --> 04:35.309
I already told you, Leon,
I'm not gonna be Santa.

04:35.409 --> 04:36.410
Oh, now, why not, Walter?

04:36.510 --> 04:37.911
It's $10 an hour.

04:38.011 --> 04:40.748
I heard they never did
find that last guy's finger.

04:40.848 --> 04:42.215
No, he's fine.

04:42.316 --> 04:44.084
And he'll be able to hold
a cup again by February.

04:44.184 --> 04:44.985
[laughter]

04:45.085 --> 04:48.288
Yeah, goodbye, Leon.

04:48.389 --> 04:50.358
Jeez, if I don't
find somebody soon,

04:50.458 --> 04:52.560
I'm gonna have to throw
that fat suit on myself.

04:52.660 --> 04:54.362
Did you ask Dan?
- Yeah, I did.

04:54.462 --> 04:55.896
I asked him, but he can't do it.

04:55.996 --> 04:57.465
I mean, we really
need the money, too.

04:57.565 --> 05:00.768
Well, we need a Mrs. Claus.

05:00.868 --> 05:02.169
Well, what does she do?

05:02.269 --> 05:05.272
Oh, she gets the kids to stand
in line, she takes their photo,

05:05.373 --> 05:07.007
she hands out the candy canes.

05:07.107 --> 05:08.409
You think you could do that?

05:08.509 --> 05:09.943
For $10 an hour,
pretend like I'm

05:10.043 --> 05:11.879
married to some fat guy
that just sits in a chair

05:11.979 --> 05:13.080
all the time?
[laughter]

05:13.180 --> 05:15.115
I think I can fake
my way through it.

05:15.215 --> 05:16.584
[laughter]

05:16.684 --> 05:17.551
$7.50.

05:17.651 --> 05:18.919
What?

05:19.019 --> 05:23.156
The woman runs herself ragged
for half the money as Santa?

05:23.256 --> 05:24.725
Sorry, that's
what's in the budget.

05:24.825 --> 05:28.662
Well, but that's
discrimination.

05:28.762 --> 05:31.298
I mean, why did we, you
know, burn our bras?

05:31.399 --> 05:33.300
Why'd we march on Washington?

05:33.401 --> 05:35.002
Why did Mary Tyler
Moore take her hat

05:35.102 --> 05:37.405
and just toss it up
in the air, you know?

05:37.505 --> 05:39.272
For $2.50 less than Santa?

05:39.373 --> 05:41.442
I don't think so.

05:41.542 --> 05:43.977
Well there goes a few seconds
of my life I'll never get back.

05:44.077 --> 05:45.312
[laughter]

05:45.413 --> 05:47.314
I want $10 an hour.

05:47.415 --> 05:49.450
You can't change
the budget, Roseanne.

05:49.550 --> 05:51.519
OK, well then let me be Santa.

05:51.619 --> 05:53.120
Oh, please.

05:53.220 --> 05:54.522
Come on, I'm jolly.

05:54.622 --> 05:55.423
[laughter]

05:55.523 --> 05:57.224
Oh, in that case, no.

05:57.324 --> 05:58.125
[laughter]

05:58.225 --> 05:59.393
I wanna be Santa.

05:59.493 --> 06:01.629
Hey, I wanna be
Liza Minnelli, but we

06:01.729 --> 06:02.830
don't always get what we want.

06:02.930 --> 06:04.798
[laughter]

06:05.899 --> 06:07.034
Oh, come on, Leon.

06:07.134 --> 06:08.669
Santa's gotta be
a woman, anyway.

06:08.769 --> 06:10.671
I mean, who else would
do so much for so little?

06:10.771 --> 06:11.905
Roseanne.
[laughter]

06:12.005 --> 06:13.273
No, it's true.

06:13.373 --> 06:15.776
Santa loves children, he takes
care of them, he nurtures them,

06:15.876 --> 06:17.578
he loves them.
I do that all year.

06:17.678 --> 06:19.480
Let me love, and care,
and nurture, Leon.

06:19.580 --> 06:21.314
And pay me in cash so I
don't have to declare it.

06:21.415 --> 06:22.349
[laughter]

06:23.383 --> 06:25.152
I don't believe
I'm gonna do this.

06:25.252 --> 06:27.187
I mean, you're sure you
don't want to be Mrs. Claus?

06:27.287 --> 06:29.823
No, it's a stupid,
thankless, menial job

06:29.923 --> 06:33.393
that nobody even cares about.

06:33.494 --> 06:35.663
That would be just
perfect for Jackie.

06:35.763 --> 06:37.531
[laughter]

06:37.631 --> 06:39.967
[music playing]

06:45.906 --> 06:47.374
Roseanne, ready?

06:47.475 --> 06:48.275
Yeah.

06:48.375 --> 06:49.477
Is my beard on straight?

06:49.577 --> 06:50.377
[laughter]

06:50.478 --> 06:51.311
Yeah.

06:51.411 --> 06:52.245
Can you see my boobs?

06:52.345 --> 06:54.081
[laughter]

06:54.181 --> 06:55.983
No, nothing.

06:56.083 --> 06:58.686
So, Santa, what do you
think of your wife here?

06:58.786 --> 07:00.954
Well, I must have married
you before this Christmas

07:01.054 --> 07:02.255
thing made me a big star.

07:02.355 --> 07:03.256
[laughter]

07:03.356 --> 07:04.157
You're a pig.

07:04.257 --> 07:05.058
Ho, ho, ho.

07:05.158 --> 07:06.960
[laughter]

07:07.060 --> 07:11.031
Well, kids, hiya.

07:11.131 --> 07:14.134
My, you've all grown
since I saw you last year.

07:14.234 --> 07:16.136
Hi.

07:16.236 --> 07:18.472
You know, Santa can't wait
to talk to all you kids,

07:18.572 --> 07:22.409
but before he does, my dear wife
Mrs. Claus would like to tell

07:22.510 --> 07:23.677
you just what we're gonna do.

07:23.777 --> 07:25.078
Mrs. Claus.

07:25.178 --> 07:26.847
All right, listen up,
this is the procedure.

07:26.947 --> 07:28.749
[laughter]

07:30.751 --> 07:31.885
You step up to the lap.

07:31.985 --> 07:34.254
You state your Christmas wish.

07:34.354 --> 07:38.258
You get your candy cane, your
photo, and you leave the lap.

07:38.358 --> 07:39.392
[laughter]

07:39.493 --> 07:41.094
Any deviation from
this procedure

07:41.194 --> 07:42.830
will result in
loss of candy cane.

07:42.930 --> 07:46.967
Remember, possession of cane
is a privilege, not a right.

07:47.067 --> 07:48.936
[laughter]

07:51.471 --> 07:53.907
Nobody gets bit on might beat.

07:54.007 --> 07:54.908
[laughter]

07:55.008 --> 07:57.410
[music playing]

08:01.481 --> 08:02.716
Oh, that's OK, Sally.

08:02.816 --> 08:06.253
You know, Santa's just as afraid
of you, as you are of him.

08:06.353 --> 08:07.888
So now what do you want?

08:07.988 --> 08:09.289
Go ahead, Sally.

08:09.389 --> 08:12.225
Ask for that Heidi Homemaker
vacuum cleaner, and the Little

08:12.325 --> 08:14.261
Susie steam iron.

08:14.361 --> 08:16.764
Is that what you want, Sally?

08:16.864 --> 08:21.134
And tell Santa that you
want those ballet slippers.

08:21.234 --> 08:23.203
Come on, sweetie.

08:23.303 --> 08:25.205
Tell him that you want
to be a prima ballerina,

08:25.305 --> 08:27.307
like we talked about.

08:27.407 --> 08:28.742
Tell him.

08:28.842 --> 08:30.043
Uh, excuse me, there, mom.

08:30.143 --> 08:32.345
Would you mind plieing
your butt behind the rope

08:32.445 --> 08:36.416
there so Sally and
I can have a chat?

08:36.516 --> 08:38.351
[laughter]

08:39.419 --> 08:42.122
Ah, you know, that's OK, Sally.

08:42.222 --> 08:44.524
Santa's mom wanted him
to be a ballerina, too.

08:44.625 --> 08:47.628
But Santa did just
what he wanted to do.

08:47.728 --> 08:49.797
And now he's his own boss.

08:49.897 --> 08:51.298
He works one day a year.

08:51.398 --> 08:54.467
And he's way more famous
than even Michael Jackson.

08:54.568 --> 08:55.569
[laughter]

08:55.669 --> 08:57.270
Why don't you tell me
what you want to be,

08:57.370 --> 08:59.873
and then maybe I can help you
find a toy to get you there.

08:59.973 --> 09:01.008
I wanna be a dentist.

09:01.108 --> 09:02.810
- OK.
- And a cow.

09:02.910 --> 09:03.744
Smile.

09:03.844 --> 09:07.047
[camera shutter]

09:07.147 --> 09:08.849
Remember this?

09:08.949 --> 09:12.485
Well, now, Jason, Santa sees
an awful lot of teddy bears,

09:12.586 --> 09:13.987
you know.

09:14.087 --> 09:16.790
You gave it to me last year.

09:16.890 --> 09:19.492
Well that's because
you were such a good boy.

09:19.593 --> 09:20.393
I hate it.

09:20.493 --> 09:22.162
[laughter]

09:23.563 --> 09:27.267
I wrote you a letter
asking for a truck.

09:27.367 --> 09:29.670
Well, hm.

09:29.770 --> 09:32.272
Mrs. Claus, come here
a minute, please.

09:32.372 --> 09:33.173
Yes, Santa.

09:33.273 --> 09:35.909
There seems to be some mix up.

09:36.009 --> 09:37.811
I never got Jason's letter.

09:37.911 --> 09:39.412
Now I want you to
get on the phone

09:39.512 --> 09:41.915
and find the elf responsible for
this, and fire him immediately.

09:42.015 --> 09:43.150
[laughter]
He's gone.

09:43.250 --> 09:44.051
He's history.

09:44.151 --> 09:44.952
Right away, Santa.

09:47.487 --> 09:48.455
Happy now, Jason?

09:48.555 --> 09:49.657
Uh-huh.

09:49.757 --> 09:50.590
Then smile.

09:50.691 --> 09:53.460
[camera shutter]

09:53.560 --> 09:54.494
[cooing]

09:54.594 --> 09:56.429
And does little Ed
want to tell Santa

09:56.529 --> 09:58.565
what he wants for Christmas?

09:58.666 --> 10:01.534
Well, he'd like to stay
with his Auntie Roseanne

10:01.635 --> 10:03.837
for a whole weekend,
so his mommy

10:03.937 --> 10:06.006
and daddy can go away together.

10:06.106 --> 10:09.142
Crystal, I already got you
a limited edition Rodbell's

10:09.242 --> 10:11.344
coffee mug, so would
you just give it a rest

10:11.444 --> 10:12.780
so I can talk to the kid here?

10:12.880 --> 10:14.648
[laughter]

10:17.117 --> 10:20.320
A new nightie,
big dangly earrings,

10:20.420 --> 10:22.222
and three speed hair dryer.

10:22.322 --> 10:25.926
Yeah, and a bottle of
that Submission perfume.

10:26.026 --> 10:28.328
The big size, because
Rodbell's will give

10:28.428 --> 10:29.730
me a free umbrella with that.

10:29.830 --> 10:31.064
[laughter]

10:31.164 --> 10:34.634
OK, now give that to your dad,
and give Santa a big kiss.

10:34.735 --> 10:35.568
Oh, mom.

10:35.669 --> 10:41.208
[camera shutter]

10:41.308 --> 10:42.976
Here we go, Jimmy.

10:43.076 --> 10:44.277
There you go.

10:44.377 --> 10:46.179
Jackie, this kid wasn't next.

10:46.279 --> 10:47.715
Sure he was.

10:47.815 --> 10:49.216
He was way back in line.

10:49.316 --> 10:50.150
He gave me a buck.

10:50.250 --> 10:51.051
[camera shutter]

10:51.151 --> 10:52.585
[laughter]

10:55.622 --> 10:56.924
There you go.

10:57.024 --> 10:58.625
Good as new.

10:58.726 --> 11:01.194
All right, now there's
Life Saver in there.

11:01.294 --> 11:02.562
[camera shutter]

11:02.662 --> 11:04.364
Hey, kid, get away
from that camera.

11:04.464 --> 11:05.565
[camera shutter]
You hear me?

11:05.665 --> 11:06.466
[camera shutter]

11:06.566 --> 11:07.434
Get away from that camera!

11:07.534 --> 11:08.335
[camera shutter]

11:08.435 --> 11:09.903
[laughter]

11:11.972 --> 11:14.307
[music playing]

11:20.814 --> 11:23.851
Well, come on up here.

11:23.951 --> 11:25.819
Oh, all righty.

11:25.919 --> 11:26.720
What's your name?

11:26.820 --> 11:27.620
Sammy.

11:27.721 --> 11:29.156
And I've been good.

11:29.256 --> 11:30.891
Oh, a kid that
knows the drill.

11:30.991 --> 11:31.792
I like that.

11:31.892 --> 11:32.993
[laughter]

11:33.093 --> 11:34.895
What can I get for you?

11:34.995 --> 11:37.497
A BB gun.

11:37.597 --> 11:40.533
Oh, I'm sorry, but Santa's
fresh out of guns this year.

11:40.633 --> 11:42.069
Oh, come on, Santa.

11:42.169 --> 11:43.470
See, I don't have a dad.

11:43.570 --> 11:45.839
And I need a gun to
protect the house.

11:45.939 --> 11:50.243
You do too have a dad, jeez.

11:50.343 --> 11:51.845
Oh, you fibbed to Santa.

11:51.945 --> 11:52.946
You're getting clothes.

11:53.046 --> 11:54.748
[laughter]

11:55.783 --> 11:57.951
Mom!

11:58.051 --> 12:00.487
Well, Santa, usually
he's a pretty good boy.

12:00.587 --> 12:03.656
So I think maybe a
sled would be OK.

12:03.757 --> 12:04.557
All right.

12:04.657 --> 12:05.926
But you just remember this.

12:06.026 --> 12:08.962
I know when you're sleeping,
and I know you're awake, see.

12:09.062 --> 12:10.363
You step out of
line one more time,

12:10.463 --> 12:13.200
you're gonna wake up Christmas
morning knee deep in sweaters.

12:13.300 --> 12:15.002
[laughter]

12:15.102 --> 12:16.069
Smile.

12:16.169 --> 12:18.438
[camera shutter]

12:18.538 --> 12:21.308
Go get your candy cane.

12:21.408 --> 12:24.878
I can't believe he did
that right in front of me.

12:24.978 --> 12:26.613
Well, we all lie sometimes.

12:26.713 --> 12:29.016
Like, for instance, I'm
not really Santa Claus.

12:29.116 --> 12:30.350
[laughter]

12:30.450 --> 12:31.251
I know.

12:31.351 --> 12:32.652
Darlene told me.

12:32.752 --> 12:35.188
Oh, are you one of Darlene's
teachers, or something?

12:35.288 --> 12:39.192
No, actually I own the
bookstore down on 3rd Street.

12:39.292 --> 12:40.093
Darlene comes in a lot.

12:40.193 --> 12:42.162
My name's Karen Miller.

12:42.262 --> 12:43.964
Oh, you're Karen?

12:44.064 --> 12:45.565
JACKIE: I already gave
you a candy cane, Sammy.

12:45.665 --> 12:46.466
SAMMY: Did not.

12:46.566 --> 12:47.400
JACKIE: I did too!

12:47.500 --> 12:48.601
[laughter]

12:48.701 --> 12:50.203
Oh, well I better go.

12:50.303 --> 12:51.104
It's nice to meet you.

12:51.204 --> 12:53.706
Excuse me.

12:53.807 --> 12:56.043
Hey, do you believe that kid?

12:56.143 --> 12:56.977
What's the matter?

12:57.077 --> 12:58.378
Well, remember
I told you Darlene

12:58.478 --> 12:59.312
had that new friend, Karen?

12:59.412 --> 13:00.213
Yeah.

13:00.313 --> 13:01.648
What, was that her mom?

13:01.748 --> 13:03.750
No, that's her.

13:03.851 --> 13:04.784
You're kidding.

13:04.885 --> 13:06.820
I thought she'd be younger.

13:06.920 --> 13:09.589
Well duh, Jackie.

13:09.689 --> 13:12.125
Well, so what?

13:12.225 --> 13:13.961
Well, maybe she's the reason
why Darlene's all weird,

13:14.061 --> 13:16.229
you know?
Look at, she's all in black.

13:16.329 --> 13:17.597
Darlene dresses all in black.

13:17.697 --> 13:19.099
And she owns a bookstore.

13:19.199 --> 13:21.268
And Darlene's been doing
all this reading lately.

13:21.368 --> 13:23.803
It's not like it's
a cult, or something.

13:23.904 --> 13:25.939
And what happened to you being
so happy that Darlene even

13:26.039 --> 13:27.007
had a friend?

13:27.107 --> 13:29.809
Yeah, but this friend's
supposed to be 15,

13:29.910 --> 13:32.679
with a retainer and a
bad attitude, you know.

13:32.779 --> 13:34.481
The kind of kid
you want to smack.

13:34.581 --> 13:35.815
That's what I was hoping for.

13:35.916 --> 13:37.784
[laughter]

13:37.885 --> 13:40.287
[music playing]

13:54.834 --> 13:55.735
Hi.

13:55.835 --> 13:56.803
Remember me?

13:56.904 --> 13:58.671
Uh.

13:58.771 --> 14:00.373
Fat guy, beard, at the mall.

14:00.473 --> 14:02.042
Oh, Mrs. Conner.

14:02.142 --> 14:02.943
Rosanne.

14:03.043 --> 14:03.977
Roseanne, hi.

14:04.077 --> 14:05.712
Hi.

14:05.812 --> 14:07.380
Um, how's Sammy?

14:07.480 --> 14:10.050
Oh, well we just
had a big fight.

14:10.150 --> 14:11.618
I told them to go
clean his room,

14:11.718 --> 14:14.287
and he said he couldn't hear
me because he was born deaf.

14:14.387 --> 14:15.722
[laughter]

14:15.822 --> 14:18.391
Well, that's pretty
good for his age.

14:18.491 --> 14:19.759
I'll tell you, I'll
be real glad when

14:19.859 --> 14:21.828
he's out of this lying phase.

14:21.929 --> 14:22.996
Is he your only kid?

14:23.096 --> 14:23.897
Yeah.

14:23.997 --> 14:25.232
Yeah, I got three.

14:25.332 --> 14:26.333
It's not a phase.

14:26.433 --> 14:28.168
[laughter]

14:29.202 --> 14:30.470
It's a nice shop.

14:30.570 --> 14:32.139
Oh, yeah, thanks.

14:32.239 --> 14:33.606
I can't compete
with the big chains,

14:33.706 --> 14:35.909
so I mostly sell the
hard to find stuff.

14:36.009 --> 14:37.210
Not to Darlene, of course.

14:37.310 --> 14:38.478
She's my worst customer.

14:38.578 --> 14:40.180
Comes in here all the
time, sits in the back,

14:40.280 --> 14:42.382
reads, never buys anything.

14:42.482 --> 14:44.551
Yeah, she probably
got that from me.

14:44.651 --> 14:47.154
I'm the one that taught her to
eat dinner in the supermarket.

14:47.254 --> 14:49.056
[laughter]

14:49.156 --> 14:50.523
She's not bothering you, is she?

14:50.623 --> 14:52.325
Oh, are you kidding?
No.

14:52.425 --> 14:53.326
She's a real pleasure.

14:53.426 --> 14:55.828
Yeah, that's
just how her father

14:55.929 --> 14:56.964
and I describe her at home.

14:57.064 --> 14:58.898
[laughter]

15:00.200 --> 15:02.269
You know, um, Karen, I
came over here because I--

15:02.369 --> 15:03.636
I wanted to, uh--

15:03.736 --> 15:05.805
I know, you want to talk about
the "Star Trek" convention,

15:05.905 --> 15:07.941
right?

15:08.041 --> 15:09.276
Well, we can start there.

15:09.376 --> 15:10.377
[laughter]

15:10.477 --> 15:12.312
I-- I was gonna bring
it up at the store,

15:12.412 --> 15:13.646
but you were kind of crazed.

15:13.746 --> 15:15.882
She wouldn't miss any
school, or anything.

15:15.983 --> 15:18.685
Um, it's just that she got so
excited when I mentioned it.

15:18.785 --> 15:21.154
My husband and I were thinking
that, gee, we'd really

15:21.254 --> 15:22.355
love to take Sammy this year.

15:22.455 --> 15:23.923
And she's so good with
him, we figured she could

15:24.024 --> 15:25.292
take care of him at night.

15:25.392 --> 15:26.960
And I understand
why you said no.

15:27.060 --> 15:28.561
But believe me, my
husband and I are--

15:28.661 --> 15:30.563
are perfectly normal
people who just

15:30.663 --> 15:33.266
happen to dress up like
Romulans once or twice a year.

15:33.366 --> 15:34.701
[laughter]

15:35.735 --> 15:37.704
Well, I didn't exactly say no.

15:37.804 --> 15:39.772
Oh, well-- well great.

15:39.872 --> 15:41.108
I wish you'd think about it.

15:41.208 --> 15:42.742
I mean, she just is so excited.

15:42.842 --> 15:44.477
She's so into science
fiction right now.

15:44.577 --> 15:47.280
I mean, just look at all
the stuff she's writing.

15:47.380 --> 15:49.249
Yeah, yeah, we'll
I'd really like to.

15:49.349 --> 15:51.784
You got any of it laying around?

15:51.884 --> 15:53.920
What-- uh, what do you--

15:54.021 --> 15:55.855
she hasn't shown
you any of them?

15:55.955 --> 15:57.190
No.

15:57.290 --> 15:59.192
Oh.

15:59.292 --> 16:02.062
Well, maybe, you know, she's,
like, testing them out on me

16:02.162 --> 16:05.132
before she shows them to you.
- That's a nice try.

16:05.232 --> 16:07.300
I don't think so.

16:07.400 --> 16:10.037
DARLENE: What are
you doing here?

16:10.137 --> 16:12.705
Well, I met Karen at the mall.

16:12.805 --> 16:14.407
You just can't stay
out of my life, can you?

16:14.507 --> 16:15.542
No.

16:15.642 --> 16:17.877
I can't believe
you're spying on me.

16:17.977 --> 16:20.313
Well I can't believe a lot
of things either, Darlene.

16:20.413 --> 16:22.715
You know, it would probably
be a lot easier to pretend

16:22.815 --> 16:24.084
I'm not here, if I'm not here.

16:24.184 --> 16:26.786
Oh, man.

16:26.886 --> 16:31.158
Well how come you didn't
tell me that Karen's my age?

16:31.258 --> 16:32.892
Well, that's none
of your business.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.527
Well, what is my
business, Darlene?

16:34.627 --> 16:36.796
Do I get to find out how
come I'm not letting you go

16:36.896 --> 16:38.598
to this "Star Trek"
convention that you

16:38.698 --> 16:40.200
never even told me about?

16:40.300 --> 16:41.668
Because if I would
have told you about it,

16:41.768 --> 16:43.970
you would have come down
here and embarrassed me.

16:44.071 --> 16:47.240
Well, I'm here anyway.

16:47.340 --> 16:50.677
I want to know how come she
knows more about you than I do.

16:50.777 --> 16:53.146
How come you can talk
to her, and not me?

16:53.246 --> 16:55.582
How come she gets to read
all the stuff you're writing,

16:55.682 --> 16:56.483
and I don't?

16:56.583 --> 16:58.351
Because you'd laugh.

16:58.451 --> 17:00.087
You'd make a joke out of it.

17:00.187 --> 17:01.688
I would not laugh.

17:01.788 --> 17:04.291
I didn't laugh when you
showed me that poem.

17:04.391 --> 17:05.492
That was like two years ago.

17:05.592 --> 17:06.793
I mean you put it
on the refrigerator.

17:06.893 --> 17:08.428
You thought it was cute.

17:08.528 --> 17:10.297
Well, that's because
I was proud of you.

17:10.397 --> 17:12.565
Yeah, well, I'm
not cute anymore.

17:12.665 --> 17:15.868
Oh believe me, Darlene, nobody
knows that better than I do.

17:15.968 --> 17:17.003
What would you
do if I told you

17:17.104 --> 17:18.571
that I didn't believe in
God, and that's the kind

17:18.671 --> 17:20.006
of stuff I write about?

17:20.107 --> 17:22.609
Would you put that
on the refrigerator?

17:22.709 --> 17:25.145
Oh, so, what, you
don't believe in God now?

17:25.245 --> 17:26.646
Maybe.

17:26.746 --> 17:29.449
Well, who do
you think created,

17:29.549 --> 17:31.818
you know, the final
frontier, the place where

17:31.918 --> 17:33.386
no man's ever gone before?

17:33.486 --> 17:34.654
Who do you think did that?

17:34.754 --> 17:36.123
James T. Kirk, huh?

17:36.223 --> 17:37.357
[laughter]

17:37.457 --> 17:38.258
Typical.

17:38.358 --> 17:39.426
Do a joke.

17:39.526 --> 17:40.960
Oh yeah, well you've
got it all figured out,

17:41.060 --> 17:42.662
don't you, Darlene?

17:42.762 --> 17:45.098
You know, when I
was 15, I was sure

17:45.198 --> 17:46.433
that I knew everything, too.

17:46.533 --> 17:47.967
But the older you get,
the more you find out--

17:48.067 --> 17:48.968
We're not talking about you!

17:49.068 --> 17:50.103
We're talking about me!

17:50.203 --> 17:53.273
I'm not like you, and I
never will be like you!

17:53.373 --> 17:56.876
It's too late, Darlene,
you are exactly like me.

17:56.976 --> 17:58.711
[laughter]

17:58.811 --> 17:59.612
Yeah, right.

17:59.712 --> 18:00.813
Yeah, right.

18:00.913 --> 18:02.482
You have to have the total
last word in everything,

18:02.582 --> 18:04.651
just like I do.

18:04.751 --> 18:05.985
- Right.
- Right.

18:06.085 --> 18:07.320
[laughter]

18:08.755 --> 18:10.623
- Right.
- Right.

18:10.723 --> 18:11.591
[laughter]

18:11.691 --> 18:12.559
Right.

18:12.659 --> 18:13.626
Right.

18:13.726 --> 18:14.727
Right.

18:14.827 --> 18:15.962
Right, right, right,
right, right, right.

18:16.062 --> 18:17.930
[laughter]

18:19.466 --> 18:21.801
[music playing]

18:27.274 --> 18:30.143
Hey, Becky, what's doing?

18:30.243 --> 18:34.046
Oh, everything.

18:34.147 --> 18:34.981
What does that mean?

18:35.081 --> 18:36.149
[laughter]

18:37.217 --> 18:38.718
Oh, Mark just
gave me my Christmas

18:38.818 --> 18:40.153
present a little early.

18:40.253 --> 18:41.053
Ah, what'd he give you?

18:43.723 --> 18:44.591
[screaming]

18:44.691 --> 18:45.492
[laughter]

18:45.592 --> 18:47.093
Dad, I'm kidding.

18:47.194 --> 18:48.428
I got it out of a
gumball machine.

18:48.528 --> 18:50.897
It's a joke.

18:50.997 --> 18:51.864
[laughter]

18:51.964 --> 18:54.901
Don't you ever do that again.

18:55.001 --> 18:55.835
OK, I'm sorry.

18:55.935 --> 18:57.069
I thought you'd laugh.

18:57.170 --> 18:58.571
No.
That was not funny.

18:58.671 --> 18:59.472
That was cruel.

19:02.709 --> 19:03.743
Ooh, here comes your mom.

19:03.843 --> 19:04.644
Do it to her.

19:04.744 --> 19:06.078
[laughter]

19:07.580 --> 19:09.081
ROSEANNE: What?

19:09.182 --> 19:09.982
Maybe later.

19:10.082 --> 19:11.851
[laughter]

19:13.386 --> 19:15.154
Hey, what's with you?

19:15.255 --> 19:16.723
Oh, I just met Karen.

19:16.823 --> 19:17.757
Darlene's friend?

19:17.857 --> 19:19.892
Yeah.

19:19.992 --> 19:21.093
What's she like?

19:21.194 --> 19:22.895
Well, she has a five-year-old.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.264
What, is she a senior?

19:24.364 --> 19:25.598
[laughter]

19:25.698 --> 19:28.901
No, she's my age.

19:29.001 --> 19:30.102
You're kidding.

19:30.203 --> 19:31.003
No.

19:31.103 --> 19:32.639
And that ain't all, either.

19:32.739 --> 19:34.941
Like, OK, did you
know that Darlene

19:35.041 --> 19:36.676
likes to write short stories?

19:36.776 --> 19:39.946
And, OK, Darlene likes to go
to "Star Trek" conventions.

19:40.046 --> 19:41.914
And, well, when
she's around Karen,

19:42.014 --> 19:43.283
Darlene's just a pleasure.

19:43.383 --> 19:44.183
Well that ain't fair.

19:44.284 --> 19:45.685
[laughter]

19:47.019 --> 19:49.556
It's like she's living
some kind of a double life.

19:49.656 --> 19:50.957
That's two more than
we thought she had.

19:51.057 --> 19:52.859
[laughter]

19:56.296 --> 19:58.097
Well, I mean, I guess
that's good for Darlene

19:58.197 --> 20:00.833
and everything, that she's
got somebody to talk to.

20:00.933 --> 20:01.801
Oh.

20:01.901 --> 20:03.836
This woman's OK?

20:03.936 --> 20:04.737
Yeah.

20:04.837 --> 20:06.506
She's really nice.

20:06.606 --> 20:11.778
I liked her, but I mean, I
just feel really left out.

20:11.878 --> 20:13.380
She gets the
Darlene that I want.

20:13.480 --> 20:17.049
You know, the one that writes,
and talks, and does stuff.

20:17.149 --> 20:18.851
I get the grunting brat that--

20:18.951 --> 20:20.152
Psst, psst, psst.

20:20.253 --> 20:21.421
Hey.

20:21.521 --> 20:22.322
Hi.

20:36.903 --> 20:39.272
[music playing]

20:47.447 --> 20:49.449
What's that?

20:49.549 --> 20:51.918
I guess it's something
that Darlene wrote.

20:52.018 --> 20:56.923
So I guess I do get a
Christmas bonus, after all.

20:57.023 --> 20:59.326
[music playing]

21:07.634 --> 21:10.737
What does your mom do when
you, uh, get in trouble?

21:10.837 --> 21:11.638
Well--

21:11.738 --> 21:13.906
She yell at you?

21:14.006 --> 21:19.912
Usually she just says
not to do it again.

21:20.012 --> 21:21.548
And then you do
it again, right?

21:21.648 --> 21:23.750
Ta, no.

21:23.850 --> 21:26.185
Then you never do it again?

21:26.285 --> 21:27.387
Well--

21:27.487 --> 21:28.955
You totally mind
what your mom says?

21:29.055 --> 21:29.856
That's pretty amazing.

21:33.460 --> 21:34.694
Did you, when you were little?

21:34.794 --> 21:35.595
No.

21:35.695 --> 21:36.763
[laughter]

21:36.863 --> 21:37.797
No, I never minded.

21:37.897 --> 21:40.032
That's why I'm a huge star now.

21:40.132 --> 21:41.233
[laughter]

21:43.436 --> 21:44.837

21:52.712 --> 21:55.382
