00:04.839 --> 00:06.716
AVA: We're a lot alike, you know.

00:06.799 --> 00:08.884
You'd do anything to get what you want.

00:10.469 --> 00:11.554
CORNELIUS: What did she tell you?

00:11.637 --> 00:13.305
I can't wait to hear.

00:13.389 --> 00:16.016
Your father is telling people
I slept with him.

00:16.100 --> 00:18.227
I should never have made you come.

00:18.310 --> 00:21.313
NINA: Your father died
from an overdose of insulin.

00:21.397 --> 00:22.815
Someone in the hospital gave it to him.

00:23.065 --> 00:24.734
Now there's nothing keeping us apart.

00:24.817 --> 00:25.985
-You and I are way past that.
-Look, we're not... We'll just...

00:26.068 --> 00:27.570
-We'll put everything behind...
-Ava, stop!

00:28.154 --> 00:29.280
AVA: You ungrateful prick.

00:29.363 --> 00:31.741
When was the last time
you had a mammogram?

00:31.824 --> 00:34.785
You are saying that I have breast cancer?

00:35.369 --> 00:37.955
I have something to tell you.
My lymphoma is back.

00:38.205 --> 00:40.374
I want to marry you again.

00:41.125 --> 00:44.378
ETHAN: Anyone else would have
bailed on this whole mess a long time ago.

00:45.212 --> 00:46.213
But you're still here.

00:46.297 --> 00:48.424
APRIL: Because it's you, Ethan.

00:48.883 --> 00:49.967
I'm late.

00:50.509 --> 00:52.052
-Late?
-My period.

00:52.636 --> 00:53.679
LEE: Tim Burke's out of prison.

00:53.763 --> 00:56.932
You were responsible for his father
and his brother being incarcerated.

00:57.141 --> 00:58.934
You've known Natalie for a while.

00:59.018 --> 01:01.854
What do you think, will she like it?

01:02.563 --> 01:04.190
Agent Lee told me what was going on.

01:04.857 --> 01:05.900
LEE: Will loves you.

01:05.983 --> 01:07.985
You would be a fool not to take him back.

01:08.068 --> 01:09.195
NATALIE: I am so sorry.

01:09.278 --> 01:10.654
Whoa.

01:14.867 --> 01:16.869
Natalie! No!

01:17.953 --> 01:19.163
Natalie!

01:19.747 --> 01:20.748
Natalie!

01:24.877 --> 01:25.878
(GROANING)

01:30.883 --> 01:32.176
Dr. Halstead?

01:32.843 --> 01:34.845
I got her. Get to the Doctors' Lot.

01:34.929 --> 01:35.971
Yes, Doctor.

01:36.514 --> 01:37.932
MARCEL: What am I looking at?

01:38.015 --> 01:39.600
Dr. Manning was thrown from the vehicle.

01:39.683 --> 01:40.851
Blunt head trauma, loss of consciousness.

01:40.935 --> 01:42.269
MARCEL: Elsa? Yeah?

01:43.103 --> 01:45.272
Put a collar on her. Start an IV
and get her on the monitors.

01:45.356 --> 01:46.816
-Yes, Doctor.
-And a nasal airway.

01:46.899 --> 01:49.360
I got it.
And a chest X-ray.

01:49.443 --> 01:50.820
-ELSA: Yes, Doctor.
-Take our boy here to Trauma 2.

01:50.903 --> 01:52.530
Elsa will give you a look-see.
Nah, I'm staying with Natalie.

01:52.613 --> 01:54.365
-You're a mess, Will. Come on.
-I'm staying.

01:54.448 --> 01:57.284
Halstead, you're her boyfriend or whatnot,
impairs judgment. Go.

01:57.368 --> 01:58.410
-WILL: I just...
-Please, Dr. Halstead.

01:58.494 --> 02:00.162
Whoa! Hey, hey, hey, hey!

02:00.246 --> 02:02.373
It's all right, man. I got her.

02:02.456 --> 02:03.958
Go on. Dr. Manning.

02:04.041 --> 02:06.168
Come on. Come on, come on, come on.
She's gonna be okay.

02:07.253 --> 02:08.504
MARCEL: Natalie.

02:11.090 --> 02:12.174
Talk to me.

02:14.885 --> 02:17.555
She's not protecting her airway.
She's clamping down.

02:18.389 --> 02:20.683
-20 etomidate and 100 sux.
-NURSE: Right away.

02:22.184 --> 02:23.519
And that's ready.

02:27.189 --> 02:28.399
MARCEL: I'm in.

02:31.610 --> 02:34.154
You should be in a gown.
Okay, please let me examine you properly.

02:34.238 --> 02:36.782
Elsa, I'm fine. I just need to
catch my breath...

02:36.866 --> 02:37.867
No. You're covered in blood.

02:37.950 --> 02:39.326
Did you lose consciousness
at any point?

02:39.410 --> 02:40.411
No. I'm good.

02:41.120 --> 02:42.246
Okay.

02:43.455 --> 02:45.374
You need stitches.
I need to call the plastics resident.

02:45.457 --> 02:46.500
No. You just do it.

02:46.584 --> 02:48.794
No, I'm only a student.
The resident will do a much better job.

02:48.878 --> 02:50.546
I don't care.
I just wanna get back to Natalie.

02:51.589 --> 02:52.923
Okay. Um...

02:53.549 --> 02:55.342
-Suture kit, please.
-Okay.

02:55.426 --> 02:57.011
Sorry.

02:57.094 --> 03:00.139
Excuse me? Excuse me. I... I heard
Dr. Manning was in an accident.

03:00.222 --> 03:02.391
Dr. Marcel from Trauma
is taking care of her.

03:02.808 --> 03:04.059
-Natalie!
-Sir!

03:04.143 --> 03:05.936
-Natalie...
-I'm sorry, Dr. Marcel.

03:06.020 --> 03:08.105
-Who are you?
-I'm her fiancé.

03:08.188 --> 03:09.440
Her fiancé?

03:09.940 --> 03:11.609
Yeah! As in we're engaged.

03:12.192 --> 03:14.028
I guess the night shift
didn't get the memo.

03:14.111 --> 03:17.573
-Is she okay?
-Chest X-ray and FAST exam are negative.

03:17.656 --> 03:20.993
Vitals are stable. But we don't know yet
how bad her head injury is.

03:21.076 --> 03:23.203
Tell CT we're bringing her up
for a STAT pan scan.

03:23.287 --> 03:25.831
-Right.
-Excuse me. Can I...

03:26.582 --> 03:27.625
Can I go up with her?

03:29.501 --> 03:31.337
Just don't get in the way.

03:44.600 --> 03:47.144
-(MARCEL CLEARS THROAT)
-Sorry.

03:52.316 --> 03:53.525
Let's roll.

04:16.799 --> 04:17.925
Why didn't you call me right away?

04:18.008 --> 04:20.636
Well, it... It was your wedding night.

04:22.846 --> 04:24.306
Ms. Goodwin, we just heard.

04:25.349 --> 04:26.517
Sharon, how are they?

04:26.600 --> 04:29.812
Well, Dr. Halstead has
some displaced rib fractures.

04:29.895 --> 04:31.855
He's being held for observation.

04:31.939 --> 04:34.400
Dr. Manning suffered a head trauma.

04:34.900 --> 04:37.403
She's stable, her vitals are good,

04:37.486 --> 04:40.072
but she's unresponsive and intubated.

04:40.155 --> 04:41.490
We're getting CTs now.

04:41.573 --> 04:43.075
I'm gonna look in on Will.

04:44.618 --> 04:46.912
Ethan, April, I need you now.

04:46.996 --> 04:48.789
-Elderly slip-and-fall in three.
-I'll take that.

04:48.872 --> 04:50.124
-Thanks.
-Got it.

04:53.961 --> 04:56.380
-Status on Tim Burke?
-Stable.

04:57.047 --> 04:59.508
-You could take him to County.
-On our way.

04:59.591 --> 05:01.635
Hey. He dies en route,
wouldn't break my heart.

05:01.719 --> 05:02.761
GUARD: Let's go.

05:16.233 --> 05:18.485
Heads up, everybody. Patient's landing.

05:18.569 --> 05:20.571
Possible drug-induced psychosis.

05:20.654 --> 05:21.655
Doris, I need you.

05:21.739 --> 05:24.241
-Sharon? I'm short-staffed.
-Yeah.

05:24.324 --> 05:25.993
-Dr. Marcel.
-Ma'am?

05:26.076 --> 05:27.911
I need you to stay.

05:27.995 --> 05:30.372
Say no more. Happy to oblige.

05:30.456 --> 05:31.874
(ALARM BEEPS)

05:33.500 --> 05:35.419
Maggie? Eighteen-year-old male.

05:35.502 --> 05:36.587
-Cameron Geddes.
-Stop it.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.797
Delusional. Found wandering naked.

05:38.881 --> 05:40.799
Too agitated to get vitals
in the field.

05:40.883 --> 05:42.468
-This is his grandmother, Nancy Geddes.
-Stop it!

05:42.551 --> 05:44.178
What are we doing?
What are we doing?

05:44.261 --> 05:46.221
Okay, here, Dr. Marcel, go to Treatment 5.

05:46.305 --> 05:47.973
-Need a psych consult.
-COURTNEY: Yeah.

05:48.307 --> 05:49.558
NANCY: Cameron!

05:51.060 --> 05:52.311
I'll get a psych.

05:52.394 --> 05:53.979
Then maybe you and I can talk?

05:54.563 --> 05:55.898
-Yeah.
-Okay.

05:57.900 --> 05:59.651
So, I guess we'll be going.

05:59.735 --> 06:01.487
-I'm going.
-You're staying.

06:02.071 --> 06:04.198
-What?
-You heard me.

06:04.281 --> 06:05.908
CeCe, we just got married.
We're on our honeymoon.

06:05.991 --> 06:07.201
Danny, I know you.

06:07.284 --> 06:09.161
You wanna be there for Will. Stay.

06:09.244 --> 06:11.538
I could really use your help
for a couple of hours.

06:11.622 --> 06:14.249
-So am I calling upstairs?
-No.

06:14.333 --> 06:16.085
I'll be back at the hotel
by lunch. I promise.

06:16.168 --> 06:19.088
I'm getting a massage and a facial.
Take your time.

06:19.171 --> 06:21.423
-Bye, Sharon.
-Thank you, CeCe.

06:24.760 --> 06:25.761
Your mammogram?

06:26.929 --> 06:29.640
They found a mass. I need a biopsy.

06:31.433 --> 06:32.476
(SIGHS)

06:32.559 --> 06:34.686
Don't feed the sharks.
It's not good for them.

06:34.770 --> 06:36.939
-Lock him in.
-NANCY: How could you take drugs?

06:37.022 --> 06:38.524
How could you do that?

06:39.108 --> 06:40.692
Calm down, calm down!

06:40.776 --> 06:43.278
Ma'am, can we give the doctors some room.
Let them do their job?

06:43.362 --> 06:46.865
-I'm sorry, who are you?
-Dr. Charles, head of psychiatry.

06:47.533 --> 06:50.035
Other than abrasions,
I'm not seeing any injuries.

06:50.119 --> 06:51.829
Five of Haldol IM.

06:52.412 --> 06:54.331
What is that? What... What are you doing?

06:54.414 --> 06:56.917
Is that drugs? Are you giving
him more drugs?

06:57.000 --> 06:59.670
Well, in order to help your grandson,
we do need to calm him down a bit.

06:59.753 --> 07:03.048
Let me get a CBC, BMP, EKG,
and tox screen.

07:03.132 --> 07:05.884
Make it an extended tox screen,
cover all the bases.

07:08.220 --> 07:13.392
So, Elsa says that you refused the gown
and the CT head and chest.

07:13.475 --> 07:15.811
Typical doctor, terrible patient.

07:17.062 --> 07:19.857
You know, I could plate your ribs.
It won't hurt as much.

07:20.858 --> 07:22.901
-Why am I not surprised?
-Connor...

07:23.986 --> 07:26.113
Natalie was coming to tell me
something last night.

07:26.196 --> 07:29.032
She got in the car, said, "I'm sorry,"

07:30.284 --> 07:32.202
and then we were hit.
She... She didn't get to finish.

07:32.286 --> 07:33.453
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

07:33.537 --> 07:36.039
Will, you okay?

07:36.123 --> 07:37.374
Yeah.

07:37.457 --> 07:39.293
Connor, Officer Atwater is here.

07:40.377 --> 07:42.671
Says he wants to talk to you. Okay.

07:44.464 --> 07:45.465
What's he want?

07:46.049 --> 07:48.343
It's gotta be about my father. Um...

07:49.219 --> 07:50.721
His death was labeled "suspicious."

07:51.722 --> 07:53.265
I'll be back to check on you.

07:59.521 --> 08:00.772
-Thank you.
-Okay.

08:13.785 --> 08:15.162
-Appreciate you, Doc.
-Yeah, man.

08:15.746 --> 08:18.207
First thing I want to
tell you is that I'm sorry for your loss.

08:18.290 --> 08:19.458
Appreciate that.

08:19.541 --> 08:21.251
Take a seat, won't be too long.

08:21.835 --> 08:24.338
-No problem.
-ATWATER: Um...

08:24.421 --> 08:26.924
Your father was given insulin.

08:27.591 --> 08:29.968
He was not a diabetic,
none of the doctors ordered it in,

08:30.052 --> 08:32.221
and there's no record of it
on his chart, so...

08:32.971 --> 08:35.098
Yeah, you're saying that
it was intentional.

08:35.182 --> 08:37.267
'Cause normally, you wouldn't test
for insulin in a heart patient

08:37.351 --> 08:39.311
-going through cardiac arrest.
-Right.

08:39.394 --> 08:41.688
Luckily, the pathologist
went the extra mile.

08:41.772 --> 08:44.066
Even so, can't trace insulin.

08:44.983 --> 08:47.778
So, I would suggest that they knew
exactly what they were doing.

08:50.030 --> 08:51.365
Is there anybody around here, Doc,

08:51.448 --> 08:53.408
that you think would
wanna hurt your father?

08:54.284 --> 08:57.579
The fact is my dad was the type of guy
who could make enemies.

08:57.663 --> 09:01.041
It's common knowledge you two
didn't get along so well. Right?

09:01.124 --> 09:05.712
Yeah. The relationship was complicated,

09:05.796 --> 09:06.880
but it was improving.

09:07.714 --> 09:09.549
You blamed him for your mother's suicide.

09:09.633 --> 09:11.260
Accused him of sleeping
with your girlfriend.

09:11.343 --> 09:13.303
You punched him out at a party.

09:15.639 --> 09:18.058
Can you tell me where you were before
your father went into cardiac arrest?

09:18.141 --> 09:19.142
I was at his house.

09:19.226 --> 09:20.894
Kevin, what is this?
Do I need to get a lawyer?

09:20.978 --> 09:22.771
That's up to you. You want me to stop?

09:22.854 --> 09:26.108
You gotta be kidding me.
I was looking for old photographs.

09:26.191 --> 09:27.526
Anybody vouch for that?

09:27.609 --> 09:29.528
Our housekeeper, Carlotta.

09:30.112 --> 09:31.238
Now, we done here?

09:31.321 --> 09:32.322
For now.

09:34.116 --> 09:35.117
Connor...

09:37.244 --> 09:38.412
I respect you.

09:38.954 --> 09:40.998
You save a lot of lives around here.

09:42.249 --> 09:44.251
I just gotta make sure
you didn't take one.

09:55.429 --> 09:57.347
SHARON: What did Dr. Manning's scan show?

09:57.431 --> 10:01.018
MARCEL: Well, you can see here
a grade two liver laceration.

10:01.101 --> 10:03.186
Small amount of blood in the abdomen.

10:03.270 --> 10:04.313
You need to operate?

10:04.396 --> 10:07.441
Well, we surgeons love to cut,

10:07.524 --> 10:10.068
but it's a solid organ injury.
No blush on the CT.

10:10.902 --> 10:12.237
Not operative.

10:19.786 --> 10:21.580
It's still wait and see.

10:21.663 --> 10:24.750
You all go back to work.
I'll let you know if anything changes.

10:25.459 --> 10:26.793
Okay.

10:28.503 --> 10:29.921
We need to go to the pharmacy.

10:30.881 --> 10:31.882
Yeah. Right.

10:35.802 --> 10:38.096
You told the police
about my father and me.

10:38.180 --> 10:40.807
He asked.
I told him the truth.

10:40.891 --> 10:44.353
Last night you said that I was ungrateful.
Ungrateful for what, Ava?

10:44.436 --> 10:46.188
Oh, my God, I got you your hybrid room.

10:46.271 --> 10:47.898
I defended you in front
of the Oversight Committee...

10:47.981 --> 10:50.192
You said, "He's gone. You're free.
We can be together now."

10:50.275 --> 10:52.319
Well, that was my mistake, wasn't it?

10:52.402 --> 10:55.739
Thinking you could get past yourself.

And I got a strong hunch that
that's what we're dealing with here.

Then why the charade,
sending him up to a medical floor?

14:04.803 --> 14:06.388
Well, because I'm treating
two people here.

14:07.305 --> 14:09.349
I mean, a diagnosis of schizophrenia?

14:37.919 --> 14:39.337

Dr. Bekker is a first-rate
surgeon, one of the best.

14:42.132 --> 14:43.508
Why would you say something like that?

14:43.592 --> 14:46.177
Dr. Latham, you can be
a fine surgeon and still...

Have issues?

14:51.433 --> 14:54.352
No, look, Dr. Latham,
I didn't mean to make any comparisons.

14:54.436 --> 14:58.523
I find it inconceivable that Dr. Bekker
could have done such a thing,

14:58.607 --> 15:01.860
but if you feel so strongly about it,
why haven't you gone to the police?

15:01.943 --> 15:05.864
Because I don't know for sure,
and I can't prove it one way or the other.

15:06.448 --> 15:07.699
This is untenable.

is not infectious.

But we still don't know
what's causing his symptoms.

ETHAN: And given his headaches
and lack of peripheral vision,

15:31.681 --> 15:33.266
we'd like him to have a CT scan

-Yeah.

22:23.426 --> 22:25.636
This is what your grandson
needs right now.

22:25.720 --> 22:27.555
-No, he needs to go home.
-MARCEL: Mrs. Geddes.

22:27.638 --> 22:29.307
Please don't make me call security.

22:29.390 --> 22:31.142
Security?

22:31.225 --> 22:32.852
Mrs. Geddes, please.

22:37.190 --> 22:39.067
Honey, we're gonna have to wait in here.

22:39.150 --> 22:41.486
-No.
-You're going to be fine.

22:41.569 --> 22:43.237
You're gonna take a nap,
and when you wake up,

22:43.821 --> 22:45.907
-we'll be with you.
-Just like at home.

22:45.990 --> 22:47.492
Everything's gonna be
all right, sweetheart.

22:47.575 --> 22:49.452
The doctors are gonna
make you feel all better.

22:49.535 --> 22:51.162
-MRS. DONOVAN: We love you.
-April?

22:52.705 --> 22:54.165
Have you seen Dr. Abrams?

22:54.832 --> 22:56.793
He should be headed up any minute. Why?

22:57.585 --> 22:59.837
I've been going over Thomas's history.

23:01.422 --> 23:03.758
I'm just not sure we're doing
the right thing.

23:08.679 --> 23:12.642
Sam? Sam, I think we're rushing this,
and I know what you're gonna say.

23:12.725 --> 23:15.311
Whoa, whoa. Don't assume you know
what I'm gonna say. What is it?

23:15.895 --> 23:17.980
When Thomas came in,
his pulse was a little slow.

23:18.064 --> 23:21.234
His reaction time too.
Mom said he'd been tired lately.

23:21.317 --> 23:23.027
All consistent with craniopharyngioma.

23:23.611 --> 23:25.488
But the kid's really small
for his age, right?

23:26.155 --> 23:28.449
What, you're suggesting
this is an endocrine problem?

23:28.533 --> 23:30.701
-Possible, isn't it?
-Unlikely.

23:31.369 --> 23:32.620
Very unlikely.

23:35.081 --> 23:36.374
All right, do the blood work.

23:38.042 --> 23:40.253
Hey, just so you know,

23:41.295 --> 23:44.173
if we delay surgery and you're wrong,

23:44.257 --> 23:46.217
this kid could go blind

23:46.300 --> 23:47.760
or he could wind up comatose.

23:57.019 --> 23:58.855
Dr. Bekker, thank you.

23:59.814 --> 24:03.234
I have information which I think will be
of welcome news to you both.

24:03.317 --> 24:07.071
I pressed the lab to analyze the insulin
which killed Mr. Rhodes...

24:07.155 --> 24:09.490
-What's the point? It's untraceable.
-Normally, yes,

24:09.574 --> 24:11.868
but I thought no stone
should be left unturned.

24:12.410 --> 24:14.829
Well, it appears that
this particular batch

24:14.912 --> 24:17.456
was ever so slightly
contaminated with chromium,

24:17.540 --> 24:19.250
which is indeed traceable,

24:19.834 --> 24:23.045
and we will find, in no time,
who had access to it.

24:23.421 --> 24:25.089
-That's great news.
-Yes.

24:25.173 --> 24:27.592
The police seem confident that they should
wrap this up quickly,

24:27.675 --> 24:30.803
which means that you two can stop
accusing one another

24:30.887 --> 24:33.264
and my department can get back to normal.

24:40.229 --> 24:41.397
Ava?

24:44.525 --> 24:45.818
Ava.

24:51.699 --> 24:52.700
Ava.

24:54.702 --> 24:56.537
Give me an hour to get to O'Hare.

24:56.913 --> 24:58.331
One hour. You'll never see me again.

24:59.040 --> 25:00.333
No.

25:02.001 --> 25:03.169
I did it for you.

25:04.837 --> 25:06.005
Ava, come on.

25:13.429 --> 25:15.348
We could have been so happy.

25:16.057 --> 25:17.266
You ruined it all.

25:20.561 --> 25:22.605
You really are an ungrateful prick.

25:23.648 --> 25:25.775
No! No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no!

25:26.359 --> 25:29.070
Help! I need help in here! Come!

25:29.153 --> 25:30.154
Help!

25:31.322 --> 25:32.657
Dr. Latham!

25:33.324 --> 25:35.534
She slashed her carotid.
Do we have a prepped OR?

25:35.618 --> 25:37.161
-I'll bump my case.
-Right.

25:37.245 --> 25:39.538
-Pressure on the artery.
-One, two, three, go!

25:40.081 --> 25:41.749
Let's go! Come on.

25:47.296 --> 25:49.548
CONNOR: I got fingers on the carotid,
but I'm losing her pulse.

25:50.216 --> 25:51.342
She's arresting.

25:51.425 --> 25:53.678
We're gonna open up the chest. Knife?

25:53.761 --> 25:55.429
Marty, she needs blood, epi.

25:55.513 --> 25:57.098
I'm working as fast as I can.

25:58.891 --> 25:59.892
DR. LATHAM: Rib spreader.

26:06.148 --> 26:07.441
Dr. Rhodes?

26:08.025 --> 26:09.443
She tried to kill herself.

26:16.450 --> 26:18.786
Dr. Manning, can you hear me?

26:21.122 --> 26:22.290
Lighten her sedation.

26:35.761 --> 26:37.430
All right, she's breathing on her own.

26:37.930 --> 26:41.309
Dr. Manning, I'm gonna pull your tube.
Sorry for any discomfort.

26:43.311 --> 26:45.313
(COUGHING)

26:53.237 --> 26:54.488

27:07.585 --> 27:10.504
-Sam.
-All right, squeeze my hand.

27:12.840 --> 27:13.841
Good.

27:15.384 --> 27:17.636
All right, follow the light
with your eyes.

27:20.139 --> 27:21.223
Good.

27:23.142 --> 27:24.643
Do you know why you're in the hospital?

27:25.978 --> 27:27.813
You don't remember what happened?

27:28.647 --> 27:29.732
Mmm-mmm.

27:33.652 --> 27:34.820
No.

27:36.864 --> 27:37.865
Nothing.

27:37.948 --> 27:39.450
You were hit by a car.

27:40.284 --> 27:42.453
No fractures, but you do have a TBI.

27:42.536 --> 27:44.455
Memory loss is consistent.

27:44.872 --> 27:46.207
It'll likely resolve.

27:47.083 --> 27:49.418
Your initial neuro exam is heartening.

27:50.920 --> 27:52.421
You... You try to rest.

27:53.714 --> 27:56.300
I'll be back tomorrow, and we can discuss
your treatment going forward.

27:57.760 --> 27:58.886
I'm...

28:00.179 --> 28:03.849
I'm happy that, all things considered,
you're doing well.

28:05.601 --> 28:07.812
I'll tell your fiancé
he can come in and see you.

28:09.605 --> 28:10.773
Fiancé?

28:10.856 --> 28:12.566
Yeah, keep it brief.

28:30.042 --> 28:32.503
CONNOR: Carotid clamps are on.
Marty, how much blood has she got?

28:32.586 --> 28:33.712
Ten units and ten of plasma.

28:33.796 --> 28:35.506
All right, it's now or never.

29:42.406 --> 29:45.242
it does not become public knowledge.

30:05.513 --> 30:08.140
Hey, man. Internist is on her way.

30:08.724 --> 30:10.935
-Okay, good.
-Kid's getting a slew of tests.

30:11.477 --> 30:13.145
I heard you got married last night.

30:13.229 --> 30:16.106
-Congratulations.
-Yeah, thanks.

30:16.190 --> 30:18.192
You know, I really should not
still be here.

30:18.275 --> 30:21.695
You know, I was doing my surgical oncology
rotation last month,

30:21.779 --> 30:23.030
met your wife.

30:24.031 --> 30:26.033
-Not an easy road.
-No.

30:28.327 --> 30:29.912
Just a sec.

30:37.378 --> 30:39.129
My grandson doesn't belong here.

30:39.213 --> 30:40.506
Maybe not.

30:41.632 --> 30:44.093
But what I do want to tell you is that

30:44.176 --> 30:49.348
Cameron is at an age when schizophrenia
tends to present itself,

30:49.431 --> 30:51.100
especially in young men.

30:51.225 --> 30:54.144
Now, if that's what we're dealing with,

30:54.228 --> 30:56.855
could be a... A onetime episode,

30:56.939 --> 30:59.567
or it could be the start of
a longer illness.

30:59.650 --> 31:00.818
No.

31:00.901 --> 31:03.529
-No, no.
-Ms. Geddes.

31:04.280 --> 31:07.032
It... It's an illness that can be managed,
you know?

31:07.116 --> 31:10.661
People can live long, very full lives.

31:11.245 --> 31:14.248
I've taken care of Cameron
since he was a baby.

31:14.331 --> 31:16.959
I've tried to protect him
against his mama,

31:17.918 --> 31:19.169
who was a drug addict,

31:19.253 --> 31:21.922
and against gangs,

31:23.173 --> 31:25.175
from getting arrested...

(CHUCKLES)

31:27.011 --> 31:28.804

31:29.471 --> 31:31.140

31:32.182 --> 31:35.269
(CRYING) He has a full scholarship.
This...

31:35.936 --> 31:37.896
This can't be happening to him.

31:39.189 --> 31:40.441
(SIGHS)

31:41.734 --> 31:42.735
Listen, I mean,

31:43.736 --> 31:46.488
all kinds of things happen to us

31:46.572 --> 31:48.324
that we can't anticipate,
we can't imagine,

31:49.074 --> 31:52.536
and what I've learned,
from my own experience, anyway,

31:52.620 --> 31:57.124
is that until we learn
to accept the... The unacceptable,

31:58.334 --> 32:01.462
we're... We're just of no use to anyone.

32:01.545 --> 32:04.465
Not to our loved ones,
not to ourselves.

32:05.841 --> 32:08.218
You know, Cameron needs you,

32:09.136 --> 32:11.847
and the person he is right now
needs you more than ever.

32:13.098 --> 32:14.767
You two have faced a lot together,

32:15.851 --> 32:17.227
and there's just...

32:17.770 --> 32:21.023
There's just no doubt in my mind
that you can face this too.

32:23.275 --> 32:24.276
Mmm.

32:25.235 --> 32:26.278
Well, I can go home early.

32:29.281 --> 32:30.699
Wow.

32:30.783 --> 32:31.992
That's it?

32:32.076 --> 32:34.078
He feels bad.
That's his way of showing it.

32:37.748 --> 32:38.916
Mr. and Mrs. Donovan?

32:41.794 --> 32:42.961
Good news.

32:43.045 --> 32:45.047
Thomas doesn't need surgery.

32:45.130 --> 32:46.256
Really?

32:46.340 --> 32:49.593
His latest tests show
that he is severely hypothyroid.

32:49.677 --> 32:52.638
That would account for his headaches,
fatigue, even his vision problems.

32:52.721 --> 32:55.349
But... But the scans showed
a tumor on the pituitary.

32:55.432 --> 32:57.893
What they showed was a mass
called hyperplasia,

32:57.976 --> 33:01.480
an enlargement of the organ due
to his hypothyroidism,

33:01.563 --> 33:02.940
but it's not a tumor,

33:03.023 --> 33:04.733
and it will shrink with medication.

33:06.860 --> 33:08.570
Thomas, honey,

33:09.029 --> 33:10.781
you're going to be just fine.

33:10.864 --> 33:15.828
-So I don't have to take a nap?
-MR. DONOVAN: No, you don't need to.

33:16.912 --> 33:19.748
Hey, they, um... They had this
in the lost and found.

33:19.832 --> 33:21.375
Don't know how clean it is.

33:22.459 --> 33:23.836

33:23.919 --> 33:25.212

in your condition.

33:27.047 --> 33:28.674
Elsa, stop.

33:31.385 --> 33:32.594

Okay, but you're not gonna "leave"
leave, are you?

33:36.974 --> 33:38.434
Why would you ask that?

You... You've been through a lot.

33:46.775 --> 33:49.069
No, I'll be back.

34:15.512 --> 34:16.972
Yeah.

34:17.055 --> 34:21.226
I'll need to get
a PET scan to determine where it's spread,

34:21.810 --> 34:25.939
and then either lumpectomy
followed by radiation and chemo

34:26.648 --> 34:28.233
or a mastectomy.

-Okay.
-Okay?

35:01.183 --> 35:02.226
Okay.

35:12.361 --> 35:16.281
I was just so worried
because you were unconscious, and...

35:16.365 --> 35:19.576
And no one was actually sure if you
would wake up, but...

35:19.660 --> 35:22.871
But, hey, you did. You made it.
You're gonna be okay.

35:25.541 --> 35:27.417
I can't remember what happened.

35:27.501 --> 35:31.004
I know, I know, and... And that's okay.
The doctors said that

35:31.421 --> 35:33.465
the memory loss, that's...
That's normal.

35:33.549 --> 35:36.468
-Oh, Phillip...
-Yeah?

35:40.764 --> 35:42.015
I don't...

35:43.141 --> 35:45.435
I don't remember you
asking me to marry you.

after what we saw those parents
go through today?

That's why I'm asking.

I... It's a lot of pain, I know...

36:31.398 --> 36:33.150
But it's a lot of love too.

36:54.421 --> 36:55.547
Rough day, huh?

36:56.757 --> 36:58.258
You have no idea.

36:59.509 --> 37:00.636
Why are you still here?

37:01.553 --> 37:02.721
I'm just leaving.

37:04.556 --> 37:07.726
-Whatever you said, Grandma's on board.
-Huh.

37:07.809 --> 37:10.145
So how do you want me to manage
the kid tonight?

37:10.228 --> 37:13.231
Ativan, 2 milligram, IVPRN.

37:13.315 --> 37:15.317
One Haldol if he needs something stronger.

37:15.400 --> 37:16.485
Copy that.

37:17.069 --> 37:18.445
Danny.

37:18.528 --> 37:21.073
There you are. I was just coming to you.
I'm so sorry.

37:22.157 --> 37:24.368
I made a reservation for us at Gibson's.

37:24.952 --> 37:26.536
I think you know Dr. Marcel.

37:26.620 --> 37:27.704
Hey,

37:27.788 --> 37:29.790
I think I met you the day
I got some really challenging news, right?

37:29.873 --> 37:31.458
Good evening, ma'am.
How are you?

37:31.541 --> 37:32.793
You know, I've never been better.

37:32.876 --> 37:34.336
-Glad to hear.
-Thank you.

37:34.419 --> 37:35.754
-Good night.
-Good night.

37:37.631 --> 37:39.508
-"Never better," huh?
-Never better, huh?

37:39.591 --> 37:42.052
Not gonna let a little thing like
cancer get in your way?

37:42.135 --> 37:43.595
We gonna press on.

37:43.679 --> 37:45.263
It's just like you taught me.

37:45.347 --> 37:48.100
You know what? I think I might have passed
that along today.

37:48.183 --> 37:50.352
-Yeah?
-Tried to, anyway.

37:50.435 --> 37:52.020
-You're good looking.
-(CHUCKLING)

37:54.398 --> 37:57.442
Dr. Latham, I just want to say thank you.

37:58.193 --> 38:00.612
I couldn't imagine having had
a better teacher.

38:01.196 --> 38:02.197
You're welcome,

38:03.031 --> 38:04.199
but I don't understand.

38:05.325 --> 38:06.326
I'm leaving Med.

38:08.578 --> 38:09.830
Leaving?

38:18.088 --> 38:19.715
But we did everything
we could to save her.

38:21.049 --> 38:23.552
And your father's death,
you've been exonerated.

38:23.635 --> 38:25.053
It doesn't matter.

38:26.888 --> 38:29.182
I'm never gonna be able to get past
what happened here

38:29.266 --> 38:31.059
and nobody's ever gonna be able to forget.

38:32.019 --> 38:33.437
I need a fresh start.

38:34.521 --> 38:36.857
And I just I need to go somewhere

38:36.940 --> 38:40.485
where all I will be
is just another doctor.

38:41.778 --> 38:43.030
Oh.

38:44.781 --> 38:46.408
I don't want you to go.

38:47.993 --> 38:50.912
That's very kind of you,
but you will find another surgeon.

38:50.996 --> 38:53.582
No, that's not what I mean.

38:54.666 --> 38:56.251
I'm not talking about a surgeon.

38:57.627 --> 38:59.254
I don't want my friend to go.

39:42.672 --> 39:45.509
I got a call from Dr. Latham.

39:49.179 --> 39:50.764
Please don't try to talk me out of it.

39:52.432 --> 39:54.851
You know, I've been known
to be very persuasive...

39:54.935 --> 39:56.436
(CHUCKLES)

39:58.063 --> 39:59.439
But I won't.

40:03.527 --> 40:04.861
You've been really good to me,
Ms. Goodwin.

40:04.945 --> 40:06.446
I hope I'm not disappointing you.

40:07.405 --> 40:10.117
No, you have not.

40:11.493 --> 40:14.996
You will be missed, Connor Rhodes.

40:19.251 --> 40:21.753
Would you mind saying good-bye
to everybody for me?

40:22.587 --> 40:25.090
I just think it might be
a little hard.

40:25.173 --> 40:26.591
Of course.

40:31.012 --> 40:32.597
Good luck, my friend.

40:36.101 --> 40:37.310
Thank you.

40:39.437 --> 40:40.480
