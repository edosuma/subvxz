a hard look at yourselves

the prosecution's strategy

intercourse.

you want me to get.

12:09.467 --> 12:10.991
Well, she used to come
into the store

12:11.034 --> 12:13.297
and get a breakfast sandwich
and a morning-after pill.

12:13.341 --> 12:16.170
She seduced me
into having a threesome

12:16.213 --> 12:17.171
with that guy over there.

12:18.215 --> 12:20.391
She convinced me
to skip school,

12:20.435 --> 12:22.393
steal my dad's car
and get high.

12:22.437 --> 12:23.917
She pretended
to lose her wallet,

12:23.960 --> 12:25.745
so that I would buy her
all these drinks.

12:25.788 --> 12:28.617
She was all like, "I obviously
don't care that you're married."

12:28.660 --> 12:30.532
RANDOM GUY: After we,
uh... completed,

12:30.575 --> 12:31.794
she kicked me out.

12:31.838 --> 12:34.362
It was freezing,
and I left

12:34.405 --> 12:35.537
my maroon hoodie inside,

12:35.580 --> 12:37.800
and she wouldn't let me back in.

12:37.844 --> 12:40.281
I honestly think she slept
with me just to get my hoodie.

12:40.324 --> 12:41.630
RANDOM GUY 2:
Well, she said

12:41.673 --> 12:43.371
she didn't have chlamydia...

12:46.809 --> 12:48.419
...but...

12:48.463 --> 12:49.594
then I got chlamydia.

12:51.205 --> 12:53.685
She broke into my house
and made me drive her away.

12:53.729 --> 12:56.297

said that she's the reason

12:56.340 --> 12:58.038
why I'm not gonna get
into McGill.

12:58.081 --> 13:00.301
I thought she came back to,
you know, have more intercourse.

13:00.344 --> 13:02.172
And, you know, I'd say, "Murphy,

13:02.216 --> 13:04.784

supposed to be used like this."

13:04.827 --> 13:06.829
...but here I was speeding away
from the frickin' cops.

13:06.873 --> 13:08.744
Only later I learned it was
all so she could keep me from

13:08.788 --> 13:11.051
turning her in
because she was, you know,

13:11.094 --> 13:13.009

13:13.053 --> 13:15.011
She just manipulated me.

to Josh Wallace,

on December 23.

13:48.479 --> 13:51.047

to protect her.

arresting her, correct?

13:52.962 --> 13:55.660
On some level, you must've
assumed she was guilty.

13:55.704 --> 13:57.184

would knowingly

13:57.227 --> 13:58.533

did you have any interactions
with Murphy?

14:17.682 --> 14:18.814
Yeah.

14:20.947 --> 14:23.558
She needed some supplies
for a fundraiser

14:23.601 --> 14:25.429
that she was doing
for Guiding Hope.

14:27.823 --> 14:29.825

Hey.

40:25.423 --> 40:28.513
I heard what happened
in court today. I'm sorry.

It is what it is.

40:32.691 --> 40:35.520
And Murphy will get away
with it, like she always does.

40:35.563 --> 40:37.609
Yep.

40:41.177 --> 40:43.832
And I failed you.

40:43.876 --> 40:45.747
Just like I failed everything.

40:45.791 --> 40:48.663
Come on...

40:48.707 --> 40:50.273
You didn't...I basically
just got fired.

Ah. Well, then, I'm sorry.

41:12.121 --> 41:14.080
All this was for nothing, Josh.

41:16.169 --> 41:20.347
It's gonna go back to exactly
how it was around here.

41:29.791 --> 41:32.359
Whatever, man.
You know what?

41:32.402 --> 41:35.623
I'm still chief, right? Okay.

41:35.667 --> 41:37.756
Then let's at least
get Murphy.

41:40.323 --> 41:43.544
And I mean let's bury her.

41:43.588 --> 41:45.372
How?
