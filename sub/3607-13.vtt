00:02.169 --> 00:03.336
Previously on Lost:

00:03.420 --> 00:04.587
Has anyone seen Ethan?

00:04.713 --> 00:07.131
He went to get some wood,
on the path to the beach.

00:07.216 --> 00:09.008
- Charlie?
- He went after Claire.

00:09.093 --> 00:11.678
Footprints, three distinct sets
all over the place.

00:11.762 --> 00:13.930
Looks like there might
have been a struggle.

00:14.014 --> 00:17.308
I think they've been taken.
We need to organize a search party.

00:17.393 --> 00:18.434
Can I help?

00:18.519 --> 00:20.353
I could use a hand if you're up for it.

00:20.437 --> 00:23.481
This is a deserted island.
How are you gonna find them?

00:24.441 --> 00:26.693
- What do you do in the real world?
- I was a...

00:26.777 --> 00:31.948
...regional collections supervisor
for a box company.

00:32.031 --> 00:34.117
Yeah, right.

00:34.201 --> 00:36.160
- You should head back.
- What about you?

00:36.245 --> 00:38.204
- I can take care of myself.
- No.

00:38.288 --> 00:41.332
- I admire your courage, but you...
- I'm not heading back.

00:43.627 --> 00:45.586
- Where have you been?
- What do you mean?

00:45.671 --> 00:47.714
You and Locke leaving before sunrise

00:47.798 --> 00:49.882
and coming back after dark
for four days.

00:49.967 --> 00:51.759
What are you doing out there?

00:52.970 --> 00:55.930
- Looking for Claire.
- I thought there was no trail,

00:56.014 --> 00:57.390
no one knew where to look.

00:57.474 --> 01:00.393
It's gonna start raining in one minute.

01:00.477 --> 01:02.937
- One minute?
- Give or take a few seconds.

01:03.021 --> 01:04.563
They aren't back yet.

01:04.647 --> 01:06.899
I'm sure they just
made camp for the night.

01:06.984 --> 01:11.112
If there's anyone on this island your
brother's safe with, it's Locke.

01:17.745 --> 01:20.955
They teach you how to predict
the weather at a box company?

01:43.437 --> 01:45.062
I brought you a present

01:45.147 --> 01:47.315
for helping me with the translations.

01:48.692 --> 01:51.861
I didn't have a chance
to get it gift wrapped, so...

01:57.326 --> 02:00.745
I found these in the wreckage,
and I have no use for them personally.

02:01.789 --> 02:03.456
They're actually my size.

02:03.540 --> 02:07.627
Well, half a size off, but I swear,
this place is making my feet swell.

02:07.711 --> 02:10.588
Another mysterious force
on the island revealed.

02:16.011 --> 02:17.470
Yo, Boone.

02:17.554 --> 02:19.472
- Question for you, dude.
- Yeah.

02:19.556 --> 02:21.974
You and Locke are hunting boar
every day, right?

02:22.059 --> 02:23.768
- What about it?
- It's cool, except

02:23.852 --> 02:26.229
how come you're not
coming back with any?

02:26.647 --> 02:29.315
We haven't had fresh pork
on our plate in about a week.

02:29.399 --> 02:31.359
It's not like they're domesticated.

02:31.860 --> 02:34.445
- Maybe you aren't trying hard?
- We're hunting.

02:34.530 --> 02:38.074
I hope so, 'cause people need food, man.

02:38.784 --> 02:39.951
Solid food.

02:40.035 --> 02:42.578
This isn't a game.

02:51.713 --> 02:53.881
I can't believe you
ran down that last ball.

02:53.966 --> 02:56.342
- Then you hit it for a winner.
- Lucky shot.

02:56.426 --> 02:58.386
Yeah, I wish it was luck.

02:59.179 --> 03:00.763
Is that my phone?

03:01.431 --> 03:02.974
Yeah, hello.

03:03.058 --> 03:04.475
Boone, it's me.

03:04.560 --> 03:06.894
- Shannon?
- Yeah.

03:08.730 --> 03:10.690
What's the matter?

03:10.774 --> 03:13.025
- Things aren't so good.
- Where are you?

03:13.110 --> 03:15.278
Get out of here!
Get the hell away from me!

03:15.988 --> 03:18.364
Just stay out of here!
Get the hell away from me!

03:18.448 --> 03:20.199
- What's going on?
- I can't talk.

03:20.284 --> 03:21.742
All right, hang on.

03:21.827 --> 03:25.037
Just tell me where you are.
I'll come get you.

03:25.122 --> 03:26.873
- Sydney.
- Sydney.

03:26.957 --> 03:28.499
Australia.

03:35.465 --> 03:37.091
Stay away from my sister.

03:38.635 --> 03:41.053
For a moment, you seemed
to be giving me an order.

03:41.138 --> 03:44.140
- It's just a friendly suggestion.
- A suggestion.

03:44.224 --> 03:46.392
Yes, and if I were you, I'd listen.

03:46.476 --> 03:48.644
What if I don't?

03:52.941 --> 03:55.276
I found some fresh tracks
down by the stream.

03:58.113 --> 04:01.073
- I'll see you later.
- You know where to find me.

04:10.208 --> 04:12.251
Put aside your differences with Sayid.

04:12.336 --> 04:13.920
He's hitting on Shannon.

04:15.005 --> 04:18.214
He's very competent.
We don't want to make an enemy of him.

04:18.300 --> 04:20.509
We're gonna want him on our side.

04:21.678 --> 04:24.013
People are talking
about what we're doing,

04:24.097 --> 04:26.098
since we never come back with anything.

04:26.183 --> 04:27.892
You mean boar.

04:27.976 --> 04:30.519
- Yeah.
- There's plenty of fruit and fish.

04:31.939 --> 04:34.357
What we're doing here
is far more important.

04:47.245 --> 04:49.288
Right now,

04:49.373 --> 04:51.040
this is our priority.

05:15.565 --> 05:17.358
So, Jack...

05:18.235 --> 05:19.777
So, Hurley.

05:19.861 --> 05:22.113
There's something kind of important

05:22.197 --> 05:24.115
I've been wanting to ask you about.

05:27.411 --> 05:30.162
Anything I tell you is

05:30.247 --> 05:34.250
doctor-patient confidential, right?

05:34.334 --> 05:35.751
Yeah.

05:36.169 --> 05:40.214
The thing is,
I haven't been feeling so great.

05:40.298 --> 05:41.674
What's the matter?

05:42.175 --> 05:44.260
Well, it's kinda like,

05:44.344 --> 05:47.972
my stomach.
I've been having some...

05:48.056 --> 05:49.974
...major digestive issues.

05:50.058 --> 05:52.518
- What have you been eating?
- The usual:

05:52.602 --> 05:55.688
Bananas, papayas, mangoes,

05:55.772 --> 05:57.023
guava, passion fruit,

05:57.107 --> 06:00.317
coconut, some of those weird
star fruits from up on the hill.

06:00.402 --> 06:02.570
Someone said they'd
be good for digestion.

06:02.654 --> 06:03.988
Let me tell you, they lied.

06:04.072 --> 06:06.323
It might help if you had
a little more protein.

06:06.408 --> 06:09.118
What can I do? There's no boar.
No boar, no protein.

06:09.202 --> 06:12.580
You can eat fish.
Jin's been catching a lot of 'em.

06:12.664 --> 06:15.041
- That guy has it in for me.
- Come on...

06:15.125 --> 06:18.335
I'm not kidding.
He offered me something to eat, like,

06:18.420 --> 06:20.963
right after we,
you know, got here.

06:22.299 --> 06:24.425
- That thing with the spikes.
- Sea urchin.

06:24.509 --> 06:26.469
Yeah, when I turned him down,
it's like

06:26.553 --> 06:30.222
I soiled his family honor or something.

06:30.307 --> 06:33.726
He hasn't looked me in the eye since.
The guy holds a serious grudge.

06:33.810 --> 06:35.728
You're not eating those, are you?

06:37.647 --> 06:39.815
Dude, these aren't for eating.

06:40.317 --> 06:42.026
Excuse me.

07:16.770 --> 07:18.229
I can see you there, you know.

07:21.358 --> 07:22.566
I wasn't hiding.

07:23.527 --> 07:25.986
I just didn't want
to disrupt you from doing...

07:27.364 --> 07:29.615
...whatever it is you're doing.

07:30.909 --> 07:35.371
- It's not like it's a secret.
- Hard to tell with you sometimes.

07:39.709 --> 07:42.336
Gross, little,
grayish yellow things.

07:42.420 --> 07:44.880
- Passion fruit seeds.
- What are they for?

07:48.468 --> 07:50.469
I'll show you... if you want to see.

07:51.054 --> 07:52.304
Yeah.

07:53.807 --> 07:55.391
Follow me.

07:57.227 --> 08:00.020
Please tell me
you found a coffee bar.

08:00.897 --> 08:02.398
Not quite.

08:12.868 --> 08:15.452
- When did you do all this?
- I didn't.

08:15.537 --> 08:17.371
It was all Sun.

08:17.831 --> 08:21.500
I wandered into this place the other day
when I was picking fruit.

08:24.129 --> 08:26.630
This is beautiful. It's great.

08:26.715 --> 08:29.550
She planted some herbs
and some low-growing stuff here,

08:29.634 --> 08:32.720
and then she started
a grove over there.

08:32.804 --> 08:34.554
Smart.

08:34.639 --> 08:38.142
With the boar running out, we're gonna
need as much food as we can get.

08:38.226 --> 08:41.395
- Maybe it's not running out.
- What do you mean?

08:42.397 --> 08:45.316
Maybe Locke's just decided
not to catch it for us anymore.

08:46.109 --> 08:48.611
- Why would he do that?
- A lot of mouths to feed.

08:48.695 --> 08:52.531
If the boar's thinning out, why should
he feed everyone else at his expense?

08:56.369 --> 08:59.580
That glass isn't breaking,
and the door is sealed shut.

08:59.664 --> 09:01.457
I think it's cement.

09:03.460 --> 09:05.002
What is that?

09:06.087 --> 09:08.047
The stuff in the bowl, what is that?

09:08.131 --> 09:09.632
It's for later.

09:12.135 --> 09:13.552
Not to be too difficult,

09:13.637 --> 09:17.139
but we've been coming here for two days,
just staring at this thing.

09:17.224 --> 09:19.850
I'm not really sure what
we're supposed to be doing.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.982
Michelangelo's father,

09:27.067 --> 09:28.609
he was a wealthy man.

09:28.693 --> 09:31.904
Had no understanding
of the divinity in his son,

09:31.988 --> 09:33.906
so he beat him.

09:33.990 --> 09:36.575
No child of his was gonna
use his hands for a living.

09:36.660 --> 09:40.496
So Michelangelo learned
not to use his hands.

09:41.248 --> 09:44.500
Years later, a visiting prince
came into Michelangelo's studio

09:44.584 --> 09:49.880
and found the master staring at
a single 18-foot block of marble.

09:49.965 --> 09:53.175
He knew the rumors were true,
Michelangelo had come in every day

09:53.260 --> 09:55.594
for the past four months,

09:55.679 --> 09:57.346
stared at the marble

09:57.430 --> 09:58.973
and gone home for supper.

09:59.057 --> 10:01.767
So the prince asked the obvious:
"What are you doing?"

10:01.851 --> 10:05.354
And Michelangelo turned around
and looked at him and whispered...

10:08.900 --> 10:10.317
"I'm working."

10:14.864 --> 10:18.367
Three years later, that block of marble
was the statue of David.

10:21.871 --> 10:25.124
We're not gonna stare at this thing
for four months, are we?

10:27.294 --> 10:28.460
How we gonna open it?

10:28.545 --> 10:31.880
That's what we have to figure out.
That's why we're sitting here.

10:33.425 --> 10:35.050
I mean, how do you open a...

10:36.052 --> 10:38.804
...hatch that has no handle, no latch...

10:42.475 --> 10:44.435
...no discernible way of opening it?

10:55.322 --> 10:56.447
Yeah?

10:57.615 --> 10:59.658
- I'm looking for Shannon.
- Who are you?

10:59.743 --> 11:01.243
I'm her brother.

11:08.376 --> 11:10.461
- Boone?
- What's going on?

11:10.545 --> 11:12.004
What are you doing here?

11:12.589 --> 11:16.133
Fifteen hours. I just spent
15 hours on a plane.

11:16.217 --> 11:18.719
"I'm happy to see you." That might work.

11:18.803 --> 11:21.013
Listen, this isn't really the best time.

11:21.097 --> 11:24.183
Bryan and I were on our way out
to meet some friends.

11:24.267 --> 11:25.809
Give me a call tomorrow.

11:31.816 --> 11:33.984
Please.

11:36.404 --> 11:37.613
OK.

11:39.240 --> 11:41.367
Enjoy your friends.

11:51.336 --> 11:52.628
Jin!

11:56.841 --> 11:59.676
I know you don't like me
'cause of the sea urchin thing.

11:59.761 --> 12:02.304
That's OK, 'cause I'm not
asking for any favors.

12:02.389 --> 12:05.349
Just let me know
where you get the fish.

12:06.643 --> 12:08.018
Fish.

12:09.104 --> 12:10.979
Point me in the right direction.

12:11.064 --> 12:14.233
I'll take care of my own
business with my own tools.

12:20.824 --> 12:22.991
You just said
something mean, didn't you?

12:28.998 --> 12:31.125
You know, we're gonna have to tell 'em.

12:31.209 --> 12:34.503
- Tell them what?
- What we found.

12:35.380 --> 12:38.090
They're not gonna keep believing
that we're hunting.

12:38.174 --> 12:41.427
They're not ready.
They won't understand it.

12:41.511 --> 12:44.555
- I don't think I understand it.
- That's the problem.

12:44.639 --> 12:47.474
Look, at least... I gotta tell Shannon.

12:47.976 --> 12:49.643
- Why?
- 'Cause she's my sister.

12:49.727 --> 12:51.395
Why do you care about her so much?

12:52.188 --> 12:54.106
You don't know her, man.

12:54.190 --> 12:57.568
She's smart and she's special
in a lot of ways.

12:58.403 --> 12:59.903
Fair enough.

13:01.698 --> 13:05.242
She's been asking me about this.
I can't keep lying to her.

13:06.619 --> 13:08.203
You can't keep lying to her,

13:08.288 --> 13:10.747
or you can't stand the way
she makes you feel

13:10.832 --> 13:13.000
because you're lying to her?

13:13.585 --> 13:15.377
Both. Whatever.

13:15.462 --> 13:18.547
Look, she can keep a secret.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.552
- You're sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

13:23.636 --> 13:25.596
I mean, are you sure
you want to do this?

13:25.680 --> 13:28.932
I gotta get her off my back.
She keeps asking me about this.

13:29.017 --> 13:31.059
About you, about the whole thing.

13:31.144 --> 13:34.271
Are you sure you've thought
through the ramifications?

13:34.898 --> 13:36.231
Yes.

13:37.734 --> 13:38.984
So be it.

14:06.262 --> 14:07.554
Locke...

14:10.850 --> 14:12.226
What is this?

14:16.356 --> 14:17.606
Do you hear me?

14:18.233 --> 14:21.443
- Untie me right now.
- Or what?

14:22.111 --> 14:26.031
I swear I won't tell anyone about
the hatch thing, OK? I promise.

14:26.115 --> 14:30.077
I'm doing this because it's time
for you to let go of some things,

14:30.161 --> 14:31.870
because it's what's best for you.

14:31.955 --> 14:35.624
And I promise, you're gonna
thank me for this later.

14:37.168 --> 14:40.128
Hey, I don't think this is best for me.

14:40.588 --> 14:41.838
What is that?

14:41.923 --> 14:44.383
An untreated wound out here,

14:45.134 --> 14:46.593
it's gonna get infected.

14:50.640 --> 14:52.266
You're not gonna leave me here.

14:52.350 --> 14:54.518
Whether you stay is up to you.

14:54.602 --> 14:56.228
The camp is four miles due west.

14:56.312 --> 14:57.688
Which way is west?

15:09.284 --> 15:12.953
You'll be able to cut yourself free
once you have the proper motivation.

15:45.194 --> 15:46.445
Help!

15:48.364 --> 15:51.241
I'm sorry, Mr. Carlisle,
but I'm afraid I can't help you.

15:51.326 --> 15:53.535
We'll need a little more to go on.

15:53.620 --> 15:56.038
I don't understand this.
I'm reporting a crime.

15:57.081 --> 15:59.458
Look, this is a psycho with her, OK?

15:59.542 --> 16:01.960
My sister is attracted
to the wrong kind of guy.

16:02.045 --> 16:04.212
It was his bottle.
I just gave it back to him.

16:05.423 --> 16:07.466
Hey, croc hunter!

16:07.550 --> 16:10.093
How come nobody wants to hear
my side of the story?

16:10.970 --> 16:13.805
Now, if that were her mate,
see, then I could help you.

16:13.890 --> 16:16.183
Let's finish taking down
your information.

16:16.267 --> 16:18.018
You were saying she's your sister.

16:18.102 --> 16:21.146
Then why is her name Rutherford
and yours Carlisle?

16:21.230 --> 16:22.814
- Is she married?
- She was.

16:22.899 --> 16:26.443
She's not married anymore.
That has nothing to do with this.

16:27.945 --> 16:31.823
Rutherford is her father's name. Our
parents married when I was 10, she was 8

16:31.908 --> 16:34.618
- She's your stepsister.
- That's right.

16:34.702 --> 16:37.120
No blood relation.

16:41.626 --> 16:44.294
Maybe you've heard
of my mother, Sabrina Carlisle.

16:44.379 --> 16:46.838
She owns the largest wedding
business in the U.S.

16:46.923 --> 16:49.675
I'm the C.O.O. of the
wedding clothing subsidiary.

16:49.759 --> 16:52.094
Would you like to buy
my wife's wedding dress?

16:52.178 --> 16:54.596
It cost $2,000 new.
It's only been worn once.

16:54.681 --> 16:57.557
I just want someone to go pay
this guy a visit, that's all.

16:57.934 --> 17:01.228
In the absence of physical evidence
or a direct complaint from...

17:02.271 --> 17:04.314
- Shannon.
- Shannon.

17:04.398 --> 17:06.525
We can't barge
into people's apartments.

17:06.608 --> 17:09.944
Sadly, we're the police,
not the dating police.

17:16.077 --> 17:17.661
Bryan, we need to talk.

17:17.744 --> 17:19.913
I'm not gonna waste
your time or mine.

17:19.997 --> 17:22.374
I want you to break up with my sister.

17:22.458 --> 17:26.420
- What?
- I want you to end it today. Right now.

17:26.503 --> 17:29.089
- Bugger off, mate.
- You don't understand.

17:29.173 --> 17:31.675
You'll be the third guy
I've paid to leave.

17:31.759 --> 17:35.387
Go to her house, pack your stuff
and never have contact with her again.

17:35.471 --> 17:39.015
- Understood?
- So you flew over here to bribe me?

17:39.100 --> 17:41.351
I'm going to give you
25,000 U.S. dollars.

17:43.688 --> 17:45.397
- I love her.
- How much?

17:45.481 --> 17:46.690
My love for her?

17:49.944 --> 17:51.778
It's worth closer to $50,000.

17:53.906 --> 17:57.993
Can you believe we've been here
for over three weeks?

18:00.621 --> 18:03.248
I was on my way to Bali.

18:03.332 --> 18:05.292
I travel a lot.

18:06.127 --> 18:08.670
I was looking forward
to exploring the island.

18:10.339 --> 18:12.966
Somehow I ended up
on a flight to LA instead.

18:14.844 --> 18:18.972
I guess that falls under the category
"Be careful what you wish for."

18:24.729 --> 18:25.979
You understood me.

18:28.733 --> 18:31.443
You did, didn't you?
You just understood what I said.

18:34.572 --> 18:36.656
You speak English?

18:38.993 --> 18:39.993
Please,

18:41.204 --> 18:43.288
don't tell anyone.

19:03.309 --> 19:04.309
Damn it!

19:10.233 --> 19:11.566
You know what? Fine.

19:11.651 --> 19:14.319
You win, OK? You happy now?

19:14.403 --> 19:18.031
Keep your damn fish.
I'm outta here.

19:20.576 --> 19:23.161
I stepped on a friggin' urchin!

19:23.246 --> 19:25.080
You understand me?

19:26.207 --> 19:29.918
You understand infection?
Gangrene? Amputation?

19:31.838 --> 19:32.838
My foot!

19:40.638 --> 19:42.597
Oh, you gotta do something for me.

19:45.226 --> 19:47.102
You're gonna have to pee on my foot.

19:47.186 --> 19:49.855
It'll stop the venom. I saw it on TV.

19:49.939 --> 19:51.523
Just do it!

19:51.607 --> 19:54.943
No, just pee on it, man!
You need to pee...

19:55.027 --> 19:56.862
Pee on it.

19:56.946 --> 19:58.697
Pee on my foot. I'll lose...

19:58.781 --> 20:00.699
I'll lose my foot if you don't.

20:00.783 --> 20:04.327
Just pee on it!

20:04.662 --> 20:05.704
No!

20:26.851 --> 20:29.019
- Hi.
- I didn't hear you.

20:29.103 --> 20:32.314
Sorry. I'm sneakier
than I give myself credit for.

20:33.649 --> 20:35.901
- What are you doing out here?
- We were hunting.

20:35.985 --> 20:39.154
Boone thought
I should take the afternoon off.

20:39.238 --> 20:40.822
Boone is hunting?

20:40.907 --> 20:43.325
The boy is eager to learn.

20:45.328 --> 20:47.454
- You think he'll catch anything?
- Nope.

20:52.084 --> 20:54.002
What are you doing out here, Sayid?

20:54.086 --> 20:55.754
Orienteering.

20:55.838 --> 20:58.423
I'm trying to make something
of Rousseau's maps...

20:58.507 --> 21:00.008
There's nothing to make.

21:01.344 --> 21:02.427
Exactly.

21:02.511 --> 21:05.180
Well, you made a compass.
I haven't seen one of those

21:05.264 --> 21:08.266
since I was a Webelos.

21:08.351 --> 21:10.101
What's a Webelos?

21:10.186 --> 21:12.354
Halfway between
a Cub Scout and a Boy Scout.

21:12.438 --> 21:14.731
And what does a Webelos do?

21:16.150 --> 21:18.526
Gets badges mostly.

21:19.737 --> 21:22.364
Ties knots, identifies birds.

21:24.241 --> 21:26.868
I wasn't the most popular kid.

21:34.168 --> 21:36.419
I'll leave you to it.

21:36.504 --> 21:37.629
Here.

21:38.214 --> 21:40.006
Maybe this will help your cause.

21:44.428 --> 21:47.389
- Don't you need this?
- Not anymore.

22:04.156 --> 22:06.074
Somebody help me!

22:09.078 --> 22:12.080
- Who's that?
- Boone?

22:13.082 --> 22:14.833
Shannon!

22:14.917 --> 22:17.544
- I'm tied up!
- What?

22:18.421 --> 22:19.754
Can you get over here?

22:19.839 --> 22:22.257
I'm tied up too!

22:31.058 --> 22:33.268
Hold on, I'm coming!

22:34.270 --> 22:36.438
It's getting closer!

22:36.814 --> 22:39.065
Somebody help me!

22:51.620 --> 22:53.830
Please, help!

23:16.228 --> 23:18.563
- Help me! Hurry!
- I'm trying.

23:18.647 --> 23:19.773
Please.

23:20.483 --> 23:22.150
Please hurry!

23:23.569 --> 23:25.028
Go!

23:30.117 --> 23:31.534
Come on!

23:33.162 --> 23:34.996
- Run!
- No! In here.

24:25.131 --> 24:27.507
Let me ask you something.

24:27.591 --> 24:30.135
Which way do you think north is?

24:30.219 --> 24:32.554
- Sorry?
- North. Which way is it?

24:35.224 --> 24:36.891
OK.

24:36.976 --> 24:38.560
The sun's gonna set there,

24:38.644 --> 24:42.063
so that makes that west.

24:43.232 --> 24:44.983
That'd be north.

24:45.901 --> 24:47.152
Yeah.

24:47.236 --> 24:50.071
Correct.
That's where north should be.

24:54.827 --> 24:56.619
Yet that is north.

24:58.038 --> 24:58.997
I'm not...

24:59.081 --> 25:02.667
A magnetic anomaly might explain
a variance of two or three degrees,

25:02.751 --> 25:04.460
but not this.

25:05.045 --> 25:09.007
- What are you saying?
- This compass is obviously defective.

25:11.260 --> 25:12.635
Where'd you get it?

25:12.720 --> 25:14.512
Locke gave it to me this afternoon.

25:18.392 --> 25:20.185
Where'd you see Locke?

25:20.269 --> 25:23.730
About a mile east of here,
walking through the jungle.

25:24.815 --> 25:26.441
At least I think it's east.

26:09.401 --> 26:11.194
What did you do to him?

26:11.695 --> 26:14.322
- What did I do to who?
- Locke.

26:14.823 --> 26:16.658
What did you do to piss him off?

26:16.742 --> 26:18.618
I didn't do anything to him.

26:18.702 --> 26:21.120
What, he just did it
because he was bored?

26:21.622 --> 26:24.666
- Look, I know you guys are...
- Let's go back to camp.

26:32.049 --> 26:34.509
- You were supposed to come later.
- Any bags?

26:34.593 --> 26:36.511
- Anything you want?
- Come back.

26:36.595 --> 26:38.638
No, we're getting out of this country.

26:39.181 --> 26:41.849
Is there anything you want
to bring with you?

26:41.934 --> 26:43.142
What's the matter?

26:47.773 --> 26:49.274
Oh, look at this.

26:49.358 --> 26:51.192
Let's go, please.

26:51.986 --> 26:53.444
Come on.

26:53.529 --> 26:55.405
We can go.

26:55.489 --> 26:58.283
Hey, mate, you don't
get this yet, do you?

26:58.367 --> 26:59.617
What's what.

27:10.421 --> 27:12.046
You set me up.

27:12.131 --> 27:13.589
This whole thing was a setup.

27:15.217 --> 27:17.844
- She's getting what she's owed.
- What did you say?

27:17.928 --> 27:21.139
She told me your mum screwed
Shannon over after her daddy died,

27:21.223 --> 27:23.099
kept her father's money for herself.

27:23.183 --> 27:25.935
Oh, sweet mum you got there.

27:27.688 --> 27:29.355
This isn't the first time, is it?

27:31.400 --> 27:34.319
- You've done this before, little bitch.
- That's enough.

27:34.403 --> 27:36.529
Don't touch me, you lowlife piece of...

27:38.073 --> 27:40.033
Bryan, get off of him!

27:40.993 --> 27:42.368
Get off of him!

28:12.775 --> 28:14.108
Any ships?

28:14.985 --> 28:16.027
Not yet.

28:16.111 --> 28:18.613
But I'm... patient.

28:19.615 --> 28:21.282
Mind if I join you?

28:25.621 --> 28:27.747
Been a while since
you and I talked, John.

28:28.749 --> 28:31.501
- Well, you're a busy man.
- So are you.

28:37.132 --> 28:38.925
Where's Boone?

28:39.009 --> 28:42.011
- I haven't seen him today.
- Yeah?

28:42.096 --> 28:44.847
You two have been attached
at the hip all week.

28:44.932 --> 28:48.351
Well, let me just check my hip.
Nope, no Boone.

28:51.480 --> 28:53.648
How's the boar hunting going?

28:54.483 --> 28:56.984
- Between you and me?
- Always.

28:57.653 --> 29:01.072
I'm afraid they're beginning
to migrate outside our valley.

29:01.156 --> 29:04.450
They're smart animals,
and smart animals adapt quickly

29:04.535 --> 29:07.537
when a new predator's
introduced into their environment.

29:07.621 --> 29:09.122
You mean us?

29:09.957 --> 29:12.417
The most dangerous predator of all.

29:18.674 --> 29:21.175
Does anybody else know?

29:21.260 --> 29:22.468
Only Michael.

29:22.553 --> 29:24.137
- Not your husband?
- Please...

29:24.221 --> 29:27.515
Don't worry. I can keep a secret.

29:30.394 --> 29:33.771
I took English lessons in Korea.

29:33.856 --> 29:36.274
He doesn't know. It's...

29:36.358 --> 29:37.525
...complicated.

29:37.609 --> 29:39.694
- So why don't you tell him now?
- I can't.

29:39.778 --> 29:40.778
Why?

29:43.031 --> 29:44.991
Because I love him.

29:46.201 --> 29:48.494
- I don't...
- Have you never lied

29:48.579 --> 29:50.163
to a man you've loved?

29:58.172 --> 30:00.381
Are you sure you don't speak English?

30:00.466 --> 30:02.592
'Cause there's a rumor that you do.

30:05.512 --> 30:07.054
Your wife's hot.

30:20.861 --> 30:22.987
Oh, I get it.
This is some kind of payback

30:23.071 --> 30:26.157
because I wouldn't eat
the urchin the other time?

30:26.241 --> 30:28.117
I eat this, you give me a fish, right?

30:31.121 --> 30:33.080
OK, fine.

30:36.084 --> 30:37.585
Over the lips, past the gums,

30:37.669 --> 30:39.212
yadda, yadda...

30:39.588 --> 30:41.130
Oh, God.

31:05.614 --> 31:06.906
Cheers.

31:09.535 --> 31:10.910
You need a hand?

31:11.995 --> 31:14.622
Yeah. I'd love one.

31:18.252 --> 31:20.461
I seen you around the caves lately.

31:21.630 --> 31:23.256
I needed a change of scenery.

31:24.258 --> 31:26.050
How are you doing, Charlie?

31:26.134 --> 31:27.552
How am I doing?

31:27.636 --> 31:30.721
Week two of heroin withdrawal,
or with Claire being abducted

31:30.806 --> 31:32.848
by the freak who tried to kill me?

31:33.850 --> 31:35.935
I gave you the aspirin
for the withdrawal.

31:42.693 --> 31:45.403
- What do you think his story is?
- Who?

31:45.487 --> 31:46.654
Locke?

31:47.531 --> 31:49.407
The guy is a freak of nature,

31:49.491 --> 31:50.825
highly disturbed.

31:50.909 --> 31:52.868
He probably killed all his mates

31:52.953 --> 31:55.454
the day his mom forgot to put
a cookie in his lunch.

31:55.539 --> 31:57.832
That was my first impression, anyway.

31:59.001 --> 32:00.334
And then he saved my life.

32:02.004 --> 32:03.170
So you trust him?

32:04.631 --> 32:06.090
Trust him?

32:06.592 --> 32:08.926
If there was one person on this island

32:09.011 --> 32:11.971
I would put my absolute faith
in to save us all,

32:12.055 --> 32:13.723
it would be John Locke.

32:31.325 --> 32:33.701
Come on, boy. You want the ball?

32:35.787 --> 32:38.789
Go get the ball. Good boy.

32:38.874 --> 32:40.249
Did you find your own bag?

32:40.334 --> 32:41.959
- That's awesome, man.
- Yeah.

32:42.753 --> 32:45.379
It'd be nice to get to use
your own toothbrush again.

32:46.089 --> 32:48.257
- Got some papaya there?
- Yeah.

32:48.342 --> 32:50.551
- Yippee.
- Hey, you mind if I...

32:50.636 --> 32:52.637
Oh, knock yourself out.

32:52.721 --> 32:54.764
Want to wish something on your enemy?

32:54.848 --> 32:57.183
Hope they step on a sea urchin.

33:08.654 --> 33:10.237
Thanks.

33:12.949 --> 33:15.451
Has this already been cleaned?
Are you kidding?

33:36.223 --> 33:38.432
They look happy.

33:38.517 --> 33:39.517
Happy?

33:43.897 --> 33:45.147
Put out your hand.

33:48.360 --> 33:49.819
You'll like it, I swear.

33:55.784 --> 33:57.952
Gross, little,
grayish yellow thingies?

33:58.036 --> 34:02.039
No, these are slimy,
little, bluish black things.

34:03.792 --> 34:05.376
Guava seeds.

34:05.460 --> 34:08.003
What's a garden without guava?

34:15.512 --> 34:19.098
- Are we going the right direction?
- If you don't want to follow, don't.

34:19.181 --> 34:23.393
I wouldn't have to if you weren't
best friends with that nutcase.

34:23.478 --> 34:26.188
You weren't hunting.
You were doing something else.

34:26.273 --> 34:29.984
- Haven't we been over this?
- You're a horrible liar.

34:30.068 --> 34:33.070
- We weren't doing anything.
- Why are you keeping secrets?

34:33.155 --> 34:34.612
Do you know who "this guy" is?

34:35.031 --> 34:37.867
He's the only one here that has
a clue to what's going on.

34:37.951 --> 34:41.161
- What is that supposed to mean?
- It means he's smart.

34:43.373 --> 34:45.331
He tied us up.

34:46.960 --> 34:47.960
Why?

34:51.840 --> 34:53.716
We found something.

34:54.842 --> 34:55.842
What?

34:56.928 --> 35:00.681
While looking for Claire, we found a
piece of metal buried in the jungle.

35:00.766 --> 35:03.517
We've been excavating.
That's what we've been doing.

35:05.061 --> 35:08.522
- A piece of metal.
- A hatch buried in the dirt.

35:09.191 --> 35:12.193
- Like a door?
- Yeah, that's what a hatch is.

35:13.153 --> 35:14.320
Where does it go?

35:18.116 --> 35:19.533
I don't know,

35:19.618 --> 35:22.495
but I told him I wanted to tell you,
that's when he did this.

35:28.543 --> 35:29.794
Come on!

35:48.438 --> 35:49.522
No!

36:13.088 --> 36:14.129
What do you want?

36:20.220 --> 36:22.263
Bryan took the money.

36:23.473 --> 36:25.182
He's gone.

36:30.730 --> 36:34.441
So the player got played.
That's poetic, don't you think?

36:34.526 --> 36:36.735
I knew you'd bring the money.

36:36.820 --> 36:39.029
- You are drunk.
- Do you wanna know why?

36:39.114 --> 36:41.323
It doesn't matter.
You're going to tell me.

36:41.408 --> 36:43.200
Because you're in love with me.

36:43.910 --> 36:45.411
What?

36:45.495 --> 36:48.205
You brought the money
because you're in love with me.

36:50.208 --> 36:51.792
You show up here plastered...

36:52.210 --> 36:55.212
- You've always been.
- You've always been self-centered,

36:55.297 --> 36:57.506
but now you're delusional.

36:57.591 --> 36:59.216
I've always known it.

36:59.968 --> 37:01.510
You're sick.

37:02.429 --> 37:03.804
No...

37:08.894 --> 37:11.312
- Stop.
- It's OK.

37:18.987 --> 37:21.488
It's OK.

37:51.561 --> 37:53.854
Boone.

37:53.939 --> 37:55.356
What?

37:57.150 --> 37:59.234
When we get back to LA,

38:00.862 --> 38:04.156
you should just tell your mom that...

38:04.240 --> 38:07.576
...you rescued me, again,
just like you always do,

38:07.661 --> 38:09.703
and then we'll just go back.

38:09.788 --> 38:12.998
- To what?
- To what it was.

38:14.709 --> 38:17.711
Like it's all up to you.

38:18.880 --> 38:20.839
Get dressed.

38:50.578 --> 38:51.787
No.

39:51.056 --> 39:52.723
It killed her!

39:57.228 --> 40:01.899
- You made it back.
- That thing killed my sister.

40:01.983 --> 40:04.026
It's your fault.
You drug her out there.

40:04.110 --> 40:05.861
- Your sister?
- Don't play dumb.

40:05.945 --> 40:08.697
- Calm down.
- She died in my arms.

40:09.491 --> 40:10.949
Why is there no blood on you?

40:19.709 --> 40:21.752
What just happened to me out there?

40:21.836 --> 40:23.170
I don't know.

40:25.006 --> 40:26.757
I don't know. You tell me.

40:29.344 --> 40:31.678
But your sister, Shannon...

40:31.763 --> 40:33.222
I mean, I could spend a day...

40:44.317 --> 40:45.567
She was dead.

40:46.694 --> 40:49.655
- Is that what it made you see?
- What made me see?

40:53.243 --> 40:55.702
That stuff you put on my head.

40:56.287 --> 40:58.413
- You drugged me?
- I gave you an experience

40:58.498 --> 41:01.542
that I believed was vital
to your survival on this island.

41:01.626 --> 41:03.127
It wasn't real?

41:03.211 --> 41:05.254
It was only as real as you made it.

41:08.716 --> 41:09.883
I saw her.

41:12.137 --> 41:14.054
I saw her die.

41:15.723 --> 41:17.224
How did you feel

41:17.308 --> 41:19.393
when she died?

41:23.273 --> 41:25.566
I felt...

41:26.151 --> 41:33.407
I felt relieved.

41:36.077 --> 41:37.744
Yes.

41:42.083 --> 41:44.168
Time to let go.

42:04.105 --> 42:05.189
Follow me.
