WEBVTT

00:02.219 --> 00:03.525
- Previously on the Kings of
Napa...

00:03.568 --> 00:05.309
- He left these babies
to suffer in this heat!

00:05.353 --> 00:07.398
Bring Bridgette back.
- She's our secret weapon, Mom.

00:07.442 --> 00:10.053
- I'm going to New York
for the wine convention,
let's go together.

00:10.097 --> 00:12.447
There's someone I want you
to meet. Your grandmother.

00:12.490 --> 00:13.970
She had a nervous breakdown
after my dad died.

00:14.014 --> 00:16.668
Your mom was a wild child.
She attacked him.

00:16.712 --> 00:18.018
- So, you were just
stealing grapes?

00:18.061 --> 00:19.802
- I was bottling my own wine!

00:19.845 --> 00:22.326
- The extortionist poisoned Sean
& Shawn's vines with glyphosate.

00:22.370 --> 00:24.633
- I found it in Bridgette's
work bag last night.

00:24.676 --> 00:27.070
- I've known Reginald
was my dad for a long time.

00:27.114 --> 00:28.767
[tense music]

00:34.773 --> 00:36.819
[inaudible]

00:43.304 --> 00:45.784
[crying]

00:45.828 --> 00:49.005
- Let me out! Let me out!

00:49.049 --> 00:51.834
[screaming]

00:51.877 --> 00:54.924
Please! Please!

00:54.967 --> 00:59.102
Help her! Stop! Stop!

00:59.146 --> 01:01.670
[groaning]

01:02.627 --> 01:04.890
- Just breathe, hold on.

01:04.934 --> 01:09.025
- Let me out, please! Mom! Mom!

01:09.069 --> 01:11.593
[intriguing music]

01:39.229 --> 01:41.057
[thunder rumbling]

01:42.319 --> 01:44.930
- Okay, boss lady.
What's your plan?

01:44.974 --> 01:47.629
If this storm is as bad
as they say it's going to be,

01:47.672 --> 01:50.806
then our vines are soaked,
which means our summer crops
for our Merlots

01:50.849 --> 01:53.113
and Chardonnays are screwed.

01:53.156 --> 01:55.550
- Crew's already on it.
Tarps have been laid

01:55.593 --> 01:58.248
and new trenches have been dug
to stop the flooding.

01:58.292 --> 01:59.597
[clicking tongue]
I got this.

01:59.641 --> 02:01.556
- Oh, are you sure?
- Uh-uh.

02:01.599 --> 02:03.601
You ain't spoiling my good mood.

02:03.645 --> 02:06.778
Matter of fact,
why are you always bringing me
negative energy?

02:06.822 --> 02:09.303
You're lucky after spying on me,
I'm still talking to you.

02:09.346 --> 02:11.348
- That's so last week. Move on.

02:11.392 --> 02:14.308
- Fine. I need
to be focused anyway,

02:14.351 --> 02:17.180
because between the processing
for this new dessert wine sample

02:17.224 --> 02:19.878
and the realization
that Bridgette could be
our extortionist,

02:19.922 --> 02:22.664
I need to not be stressed,
and you're not helping.

02:22.707 --> 02:23.795
[scoffing]

02:23.839 --> 02:25.667
[thunder rumbling]
Ugh...

02:25.710 --> 02:27.495
If anything happens
to the vineyard

02:27.538 --> 02:29.279
and those vines get flooded,
we're screwed.

02:29.323 --> 02:31.151
- No, you're done.

02:31.194 --> 02:33.065
The person in charge
always takes the hit.

02:33.109 --> 02:35.111
- Ugh, I wish Dad
would've talked to me

02:35.155 --> 02:36.547
before dumping
all of this on me.

02:36.591 --> 02:38.723
- Yeah, well,
if your ungratefulness

02:38.767 --> 02:40.377
becomes just too much to bear,

02:40.421 --> 02:42.901
you can slide that
crown this way.

02:42.945 --> 02:44.642
- Be careful what you wish for.

02:46.992 --> 02:49.517
Where is your
smarter half anyway?

02:49.560 --> 02:51.258
Rose was supposed
to start her presentation

02:51.301 --> 02:53.347
for the new dessert wine
30 minutes ago.

02:54.130 --> 02:56.698
What's wrong? Gassy?

02:56.741 --> 02:59.266
- No, La La Land,
she's gonna be here.

02:59.309 --> 03:01.964
She's finishing up
a Pilates class or something,
I don't know.

03:03.748 --> 03:05.402
- Where is everyone?

03:05.446 --> 03:07.752
- Christian is on a makeup tour
with Shiela in LA.

03:07.796 --> 03:09.754
Rose has him out there
with the club owners

03:09.798 --> 03:11.452
and the influencers
warming the plate.

03:11.495 --> 03:13.541
Aunt Yvette, she's at
the distribution conference

03:13.584 --> 03:15.151
with the cleavage out.

03:15.195 --> 03:17.414
You know, anyway,
I'll just do it myself.

03:17.458 --> 03:19.721
- Okay. Have at it.

03:19.764 --> 03:22.332
- Just give me a second
to upload the presentation.

03:22.376 --> 03:25.466
PR is not my job,
but it's about our wine,

03:25.509 --> 03:26.815
so how hard could it be, right?

03:26.858 --> 03:28.295
- Okay, stop stalling,
just do it.

03:28.338 --> 03:30.122
[thunder rumbling]

03:30.166 --> 03:31.994
- "This is a strategized process

03:32.037 --> 03:35.345
for managing
the long-anticipated
release of Heritage,

03:35.389 --> 03:37.391
the House of Kings' first
dessert wine."

03:37.434 --> 03:38.783
- Mm-hmm.
[phone chiming]

03:40.785 --> 03:42.265
- Damn it.
- What?

03:42.309 --> 03:44.267
- Nothing.
- Doesn't sound like nothing.

03:45.312 --> 03:47.401
We're working!

03:47.444 --> 03:48.924
Hello, we're working!
I'm the boss!

03:48.967 --> 03:50.447
- Anyways! Okay, okay!

03:50.491 --> 03:52.493
- Thank you!
[sighing]

03:52.536 --> 03:54.973
- "The world is watching.
Its palates await

03:55.017 --> 03:57.019
sun-kissed flavours of bold,
rich hues--"

03:57.062 --> 04:00.109
- Excuse me, Ms. August.
The groundskeeper called.

04:00.152 --> 04:04.418
There's a problem with Bridgette
in the production facility.

04:04.461 --> 04:05.723
He thinks you should go over.

04:05.767 --> 04:08.073
- Today's her day off.
- Yeah.

04:08.117 --> 04:10.293
- She's here to poison
the vines. This could be D-Day.

04:10.337 --> 04:11.816
- Well, we don't know that.

04:11.860 --> 04:13.427
But if she did,
she picked the wrong day.

04:13.470 --> 04:15.385
[thunder booming]

04:16.386 --> 04:17.735
[sighing]

04:21.086 --> 04:22.697
- We need to talk.

04:22.740 --> 04:25.090
- About why you're drinking
our vintage Grand Cru?

04:25.134 --> 04:28.050
- When I tell you why I'm here,
you'll be drinking it too.

04:28.093 --> 04:30.618
- Then this better be
some 1500-dollar news.

04:30.661 --> 04:32.402
- Oh, it's priceless.
- It must be,

04:32.446 --> 04:34.186
to get you out here
on a Saturday...

04:34.230 --> 04:36.580
[thunder booming]
...in a storm.

04:40.105 --> 04:42.934
- Talk more, drink less.

04:42.978 --> 04:44.588
- Yeah, what's going on?

04:44.632 --> 04:47.374
You can tell me anything,
I'll understand.

04:47.417 --> 04:48.984
- My mom's on her way.

04:49.027 --> 04:51.073
I'll talk to you
when she gets here.

04:51.116 --> 04:53.510
She's an important part
of this conversation.

04:53.554 --> 04:55.164
- Why are you making
such a big deal

04:55.207 --> 04:57.862
out of whatever this is?
- Because it's big news.

04:57.906 --> 04:59.473
Something I've been
holding on to

04:59.516 --> 05:01.257
that I think the two of you
should know.

05:01.301 --> 05:02.693
[thunder booming]

05:02.737 --> 05:05.435
- Why don't you just tell us
what's going on,

05:05.479 --> 05:07.872
and we'll fill in
Aunt Melanie later?

05:07.916 --> 05:11.093
Dana and I really need
to get back to working
on this PR presentation

05:11.136 --> 05:12.747
for the dessert wine, so...

05:12.790 --> 05:14.314
- I'd prefer to wait.

05:19.406 --> 05:21.625
- Hey, can you get an ETA
on Aunt Melanie?

05:21.669 --> 05:23.584
- Why don't we stop
all the game-playing

05:23.627 --> 05:25.499
and straight up ask
if she's the extortionist?

05:25.542 --> 05:27.718
- Because we don't have
enough evidence, Dana.

05:27.762 --> 05:30.547
Remember what happened
when we pulled the trigger
on Otis too soon?

05:30.591 --> 05:32.201
We're doing this my way.

05:35.378 --> 05:38.120
- Okay, okay. I'm going.
- Okay.

05:38.163 --> 05:40.165
[thunder rumbling]

05:44.735 --> 05:47.782
- You know, if my mom
saw you drinking

05:47.825 --> 05:50.132
out of one of her antique wine
glasses, she'd lose her shit.

05:50.175 --> 05:51.742
[laughing]
- Tell me about it.

05:51.786 --> 05:54.266
She'd be all,
"Somebody call Social Services,

05:54.310 --> 05:56.094
there's a child in danger."

05:56.138 --> 05:57.574
- "Because I'm about
to kill one."

05:57.618 --> 05:59.184
[laughing]

05:59.228 --> 06:01.622
- Then she wouldn't do
a damn thing

06:01.665 --> 06:04.625
but walk her bougie behind away,
cursing us as she goes.

06:04.668 --> 06:07.192
- All bark and no bite.
- Mm-hmm.

06:07.236 --> 06:10.195
Remember when we got
all dressed up

06:10.239 --> 06:12.241
and used these
for our fancy tea parties?

06:12.284 --> 06:14.069
- Yeah!
[laughing]

06:14.112 --> 06:16.767
That was about the only time
she almost whooped our butts.

06:16.811 --> 06:18.639
[scoffing]
- If only she could catch us.

06:18.682 --> 06:20.597
[laughing]

06:20.641 --> 06:23.861
- But seriously, I don't really
want to hear her mouth today,

06:23.905 --> 06:26.211
do you think you could just
put that glass back?

06:26.255 --> 06:27.517
- Nah.

06:27.561 --> 06:30.433
This particular brand of news

06:30.477 --> 06:33.088
deserves something
beautiful to counterbalance.

06:33.131 --> 06:36.352
- That ugly, huh?
- Uglier.

06:36.396 --> 06:38.441
- Bridgette, can you just...

06:38.485 --> 06:40.791
Can you just tell me
what's going on?

06:40.835 --> 06:42.489
I don't have time for this.

06:42.532 --> 06:44.012
There's so much to prep

06:44.055 --> 06:45.666
for the dessert wine tasting,
and I just--

06:45.709 --> 06:48.233
- Dessert wine is all you care
about, isn't it?

06:48.277 --> 06:50.366
- It's our bread and butter.

06:50.410 --> 06:53.021
It's the only way to get
this company back on track.

06:53.064 --> 06:56.416
- August, there's a difference
between loving being the boss,

06:56.459 --> 06:58.418
and loving the grapes
themselves.

06:58.461 --> 06:59.941
[chuckling]

06:59.984 --> 07:02.465
- Drinking that Shade Kool-Aid
again, huh?

07:02.509 --> 07:04.815
- No, I'm just being real.
- Okay.

07:04.859 --> 07:07.470
- Nobody doubts you love
the vineyard

07:07.514 --> 07:09.994
and are dedicated to it,
but on a micro scale,

07:10.038 --> 07:11.561
do you love the grapes?

07:11.605 --> 07:14.869
Are you familiar with their
needs and personalities?

07:14.912 --> 07:21.092
For instance, the Moscato needs
room to stretch and flourish,

07:21.136 --> 07:23.443
while the Merlot is
temperamental in the cold,

07:23.486 --> 07:26.141
but never disappoints
when harvested in the fall.

07:26.184 --> 07:29.318
- No one has a relationship
with the grapes like you do,

07:29.361 --> 07:30.928
but I'm catching up.

07:32.277 --> 07:33.975
- I guess people can change.

07:35.237 --> 07:38.066
- Sometimes, so much, you don't
even recognize them anymore.

07:38.109 --> 07:39.633
- Amen to that.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.287
- Aunt Melanie to the rescue.

07:42.331 --> 07:45.682
- Bridgette, baby.
What's going on?

07:45.726 --> 07:48.250
- What isn't going on
with this family?

07:48.293 --> 07:50.252
If it's not one thing,
it's another.

07:50.295 --> 07:52.384
I'm surrounded
by secrets and lies.

07:52.428 --> 07:54.038
- Bridgette, you said
you had a confession.

07:54.082 --> 07:55.953
- Just spit it out.
- Okay.

07:57.172 --> 07:59.740
Raise your hand if you knew
our grandmother

07:59.783 --> 08:02.133
was locked
in a mental institution.

08:02.177 --> 08:04.440
- What? What are you
talking about?

08:04.484 --> 08:06.137
- Our grandmother's in Paris.

08:06.181 --> 08:09.010
- Non, non, ma soeur.
How stupid were we?

08:09.053 --> 08:11.491
- Aunt Melanie, is this true?

08:11.534 --> 08:14.015
- I saw it with my own eyes.

08:14.058 --> 08:17.671
Our grandmother
is living in a mental ward
in Upstate New York.

08:17.714 --> 08:20.717
- You are drunk, you're lying,
and we're busy.

08:20.761 --> 08:23.067
Come back tomorrow
when you have something
important to tell us.

08:23.111 --> 08:24.765
- Why are you letting me
look crazy?!

08:24.808 --> 08:26.593
Tell them the truth, Mom.

08:26.636 --> 08:28.116
You killed our grandfather,

08:28.159 --> 08:30.727
and our grandmother
went crazy because of it.

08:30.771 --> 08:33.121
- Who told you this?
- I did.

08:34.122 --> 08:36.690
Let see you talk your way
out of this one, Melanie.

08:36.733 --> 08:38.648
[thunder booming]

08:45.481 --> 08:47.527
[thunder rumbling]

08:50.051 --> 08:51.531
- What just happened?

08:51.574 --> 08:53.489
- The storm must've blown
the power out.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.012
- Great, just what we need.

08:55.056 --> 08:56.666
- We have backup power
for some lights.

08:56.710 --> 08:58.842
Main power will probably
come back on soon.

08:58.886 --> 09:03.412
- Until then, we can all chat
about how messy this family is.

09:03.455 --> 09:06.458
- Ah, wait a minute.
[chuckling]

09:06.502 --> 09:09.157
The cooling system on
the fermentation tanks is down.

09:09.200 --> 09:11.463
We've got to get
the workers in here.

09:11.507 --> 09:13.901
- Can't, we're locked in.

09:13.944 --> 09:15.642
- You have got to be kidding me.

09:15.685 --> 09:18.470
- I know, it's the security
system I had installed.

09:18.514 --> 09:20.821
The doors are connected
to the power now.

09:21.430 --> 09:24.302
- What brilliant Silicon Valley
nerd came up with that idea?

09:24.346 --> 09:26.609
- Wait, wait,
so we're stuck in here?

09:26.653 --> 09:29.743
No, no. I'm gonna call our
security guy, 'cause this is...

09:29.786 --> 09:33.355
Shit! And cell phone service
is out!

09:34.704 --> 09:37.664
- Vanessa, why did you do this?

09:37.707 --> 09:40.667
- Because they said
the security system
is the best out there.

09:40.710 --> 09:44.409
- You know what I mean.
Why did you take Bridgette
to see her?

09:44.453 --> 09:48.544
- Okay, okay. Clearly,
we have some serious family shit
we need to work out,

09:48.588 --> 09:50.938
but right now,
we need to figure out
how to keep the temperature

09:50.981 --> 09:52.374
from rising
on the fermentation tanks.

09:52.417 --> 09:54.289
- August, you should know
how to do that.

09:54.332 --> 09:56.204
- The fermentation tanks
are your job,

09:56.247 --> 09:57.640
that's why I hired you back.

09:57.684 --> 09:59.729
- Is that why you sent me
to New York too?

09:59.773 --> 10:02.689
- What are you talking about?!
Just help me with this!

10:02.732 --> 10:04.473
[sighing]

10:04.516 --> 10:07.911
- Yeast breaks down sugars
into carbon dioxide and alcohol.

10:07.955 --> 10:09.739
- Yeah, I don't need the wine
chemistry lesson,

10:09.783 --> 10:11.741
I need you to fix it.
- I can't,

10:11.785 --> 10:13.961
and you've got about three hours

10:14.004 --> 10:15.832
before the temperature
hits 87 degrees,

10:15.876 --> 10:18.487
and the fermentation stops.
- And the wine is ruined.

10:18.530 --> 10:20.663
- It might as well
be Ripple at that point.

10:20.707 --> 10:23.579
- Fred Sanford's
beverage of choice.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.407
- This can't be happening.

10:25.450 --> 10:27.322
We have everything
riding on this wine.

10:27.365 --> 10:29.672
This is our Hail Mary.
[beeping]

10:29.716 --> 10:32.370
The main backup generator
is on, okay.

10:32.414 --> 10:34.982
And the system is still down.
- The doors are still locked.

10:35.025 --> 10:37.724
- 'Cause they only work
with the main power.

10:37.767 --> 10:39.334
- What about
the glycol chillers?

10:39.377 --> 10:41.510
- They need power too.
[sighing]

10:41.553 --> 10:43.860
- Looks like the only thing
we can do is wait.

10:43.904 --> 10:47.690
In that case,
I'm gonna find some food,
because I am starving.

10:47.734 --> 10:51.085
And maybe later, we can talk
about why our grandmother

10:51.128 --> 10:53.391
is in an insane asylum, huh?

10:55.089 --> 10:58.309
- Ooh, dinner and a show.
Love it.

10:58.353 --> 11:00.311
- Great, okay.

11:00.355 --> 11:03.271
I'll just stay back here
and figure out how we don't
all go bankrupt.

11:03.314 --> 11:05.012
[thunder rumbling]

11:05.055 --> 11:06.927
- Your wine is gonna be fine.

11:06.970 --> 11:09.669
- Vanessa, I can't believe
you did this.

11:09.712 --> 11:12.846
- I can't believe you did
a lot of things, Melanie.

11:12.889 --> 11:16.110
- Is that what this
is all about? Revenge?

11:16.153 --> 11:19.809
We made a promise.
You should have told me
you were going to break it.

11:19.853 --> 11:22.159
- Well, alright.
- No, no, you can't eat that.

11:22.203 --> 11:24.858
That is a sample
that the competing caters

11:24.901 --> 11:26.468
put together
for the press tasting.

11:26.511 --> 11:29.732
- If it's a sample, then why
can't we sample it?

11:29.776 --> 11:32.126
- Okay, let's eat.

11:32.169 --> 11:33.997
There's some Russian caviar
in there too.

11:34.041 --> 11:35.651
- Ooh!

11:35.695 --> 11:37.522
- And these.

11:37.566 --> 11:39.307
- Oh, crumble some of those
on there.

11:39.350 --> 11:41.962
- Hot Cheeto dust coming up.

11:42.005 --> 11:45.530
- Oh, well, why don't you put
some Louisiana Hot Sauce
on it while you're at it?

11:45.574 --> 11:47.750
- Got it!
- Vanessa!

11:47.794 --> 11:51.449
Why are you avoiding this?
We really need to talk!

11:51.493 --> 11:52.886
- The temperature gauge
is still rising,

11:52.929 --> 11:54.583
so I've got about two hours,

11:54.626 --> 11:56.541
then I'm busting out
a window. Give me a wing.

11:56.585 --> 11:59.936
- Two hours? Let's hope we don't
kill each other first.

11:59.980 --> 12:03.157
- Bridgette, I don't know what
your aunt told you,

12:03.200 --> 12:06.073
but it's been a long time,
and sometimes,

12:06.116 --> 12:09.119
her bitterness has a way
of clouding the facts.

12:09.163 --> 12:11.121
- Take a look around you,
Melanie.

12:11.165 --> 12:14.342
In case you forgot,
all this belongs to me.

12:14.385 --> 12:16.431
So what do I have to be
bitter about?

12:16.474 --> 12:20.304
Oh, unless you're referring to
Mama being out of her damn mind

12:20.348 --> 12:22.132
because of what
you did to Daddy.

12:22.176 --> 12:25.353
- I didn't do anything to Daddy.
You don't know the truth!

12:25.396 --> 12:27.442
- Enough of the blaming.
- And the stalling.

12:27.485 --> 12:29.052
- Just give us the real!

12:29.096 --> 12:31.489
[panting]
Mom?

12:31.533 --> 12:33.143
Mom!

12:34.275 --> 12:35.755
[panting]

12:35.798 --> 12:37.191
- I just...
- Are you okay?

12:37.234 --> 12:38.670
- Yeah, I just need to sit.

12:38.714 --> 12:40.150
- Here, Bridge.

12:43.545 --> 12:46.156
- You know, maybe we shouldn't
do this right now.

12:46.200 --> 12:47.984
- I think it's a little
too late for that.

12:48.028 --> 12:50.291
- Yeah. You opened up
this can of worms.

12:50.334 --> 12:52.946
- No, Mom, you don't have
to do this.

12:52.989 --> 12:54.556
- No, I have to.

12:54.599 --> 12:57.646
They have to know.
They have to know.

12:58.299 --> 13:01.345
I was 16 when it happened.

13:01.389 --> 13:03.521
I came home late one night.

13:03.565 --> 13:05.741
- Drunk, as usual,
according to Mom.

13:05.785 --> 13:09.527
- My mom was angry because
I came in past curfew.

13:09.571 --> 13:13.314
She got up in my face.
We started arguing.

13:13.357 --> 13:17.144
And then she grabbed my purse,

13:17.187 --> 13:20.495
and she went ballistic
when she saw the joint inside.

13:20.538 --> 13:23.628
- You smoke, Aunt Melanie?
- Boy, did she ever.

13:23.672 --> 13:26.153
- That was then, not anymore.
- What did Grandma do?

13:26.196 --> 13:30.722
- She charged at me,
yelling and screaming,

13:30.766 --> 13:35.292
and then... she slapped me
so hard, I saw stars

13:35.336 --> 13:37.904
- Oh, my God.
- I fell on the floor,

13:37.947 --> 13:40.776
and when I looked up,
she was standing over me

13:40.820 --> 13:43.387
with her hand raised,
getting ready to hit me again.

13:43.431 --> 13:46.129
- Aunt Melanie... Did she?

13:46.173 --> 13:49.132
- Before I could cover my face
to protect myself,

13:49.176 --> 13:51.178
I saw my dad coming at her,

13:51.221 --> 13:53.397
and he grabbed her by the arm.

13:53.441 --> 13:57.184
When she pushed him away...
he fell,

13:58.446 --> 14:00.665
hitting his head
on the coffee table.

14:03.059 --> 14:04.887
[Melanie crying]

14:04.931 --> 14:07.890
The blow to his head
caused an aneurism.

14:09.587 --> 14:11.546
He died the next morning.

14:12.373 --> 14:16.725
- So, our grandmother
killed our grandfather?

14:16.768 --> 14:18.901
- And had a breakdown
because of it.

14:18.945 --> 14:21.773
- Essentially, yes.
- Bullshit, Melanie.

14:21.817 --> 14:24.428
You came home drunk
and attacked our dad.

14:24.472 --> 14:27.388
You killed him!
- That's not what happened.

14:27.431 --> 14:30.652
- Here we go again.
- Vanessa, it's the truth.

14:30.695 --> 14:35.091
All you know is what Mom
told you. But you weren't there.

14:37.615 --> 14:40.749
- Aunt Vanessa, you told me
the story like you were there.

14:40.792 --> 14:42.142
What's the truth?!

14:42.882 --> 14:46.798
- When the police came
and saw Dad's lifeless body,

14:46.842 --> 14:50.715
Mom panicked. She told me
not to say a word,

14:50.759 --> 14:52.500
to let her do all the talking.

14:52.543 --> 14:54.241
I didn't want her
to get in trouble,

14:54.284 --> 14:56.112
so I just did what she said,

14:56.156 --> 14:59.550
and then I listened to her
weave this story

14:59.594 --> 15:02.423
that never included
her pushing him.

15:02.466 --> 15:07.254
- That is nonsense.
I mean, if that were true,

15:07.297 --> 15:09.299
you would've told me that
years ago.

15:09.343 --> 15:11.127
- You know how Mom was,

15:11.171 --> 15:13.390
always pitting us
against each other,

15:13.434 --> 15:15.740
encouraging us
to undermine one another.

15:15.784 --> 15:18.874
- Yeah, she did that to make us
more competitive in the world.

15:18.918 --> 15:22.791
- But all it did was make us
turn against each other.

15:22.834 --> 15:25.750
- Yeah. Boy, did Dad hate that.

15:25.794 --> 15:27.970
But what does that have
to do with this?

15:28.014 --> 15:32.844
- Mom made me promise
never to tell you what
really happened,

15:32.888 --> 15:35.935
and I did what she said
so that I could stay

15:35.978 --> 15:38.938
on the winning side,
Mom's good side.

15:38.981 --> 15:43.029
That night, when you got home
early from tennis camp,

15:43.072 --> 15:47.468
Mom told you that we got into
a fight and that Dad fell.

15:48.034 --> 15:50.297
But she left out the details,

15:50.340 --> 15:52.516
so you blamed me
for what happened,

15:52.560 --> 15:54.170
and you've hated me ever since.

15:55.041 --> 15:56.912
But think about it, Vanessa.

15:56.956 --> 16:01.699
When has our father ever raised
his voice to either one of us?

16:01.743 --> 16:05.834
- He... He was always gentle
and kind to us.

16:05.877 --> 16:08.706
- Mom. Is this true?

16:10.012 --> 16:11.318
- I didn't kill him.

16:13.494 --> 16:16.497
But I should've spoken up
when I had the chance.

16:16.540 --> 16:19.413
I should've told the police
what really happened,

16:19.456 --> 16:23.721
because then maybe
that lie wouldn't have
festered in Mom's mind,

16:23.765 --> 16:27.987
poisoning her thoughts.
So for that, I am to blame,

16:28.030 --> 16:29.858
because I could've stopped it.

16:29.901 --> 16:33.166
- My God, Melanie, instead,
you made it worse by acting up.

16:33.209 --> 16:37.170
- Because I couldn't bear
the burden of carrying
the truth all by myself,

16:37.213 --> 16:41.739
and Mom made it clear
how much she hated me
for knowing her secret.

16:42.479 --> 16:47.006
So yeah, I acted up
because I didn't know
what the hell else to do.

16:48.137 --> 16:53.490
Finally, I couldn't take
anymore, so I left, and...

16:54.361 --> 16:56.711
I wound up in Georgia,

16:56.754 --> 16:59.192
and I spent the next year
with relatives.

17:00.106 --> 17:03.196
- Mom, why is this the first
I'm hearing about this?

17:03.239 --> 17:06.068
Why do we have so many secrets?

17:06.112 --> 17:08.418
- Because there's
a difference between secrets

17:08.462 --> 17:10.246
and things that are never said.

17:10.290 --> 17:11.508
- Yeah.

17:13.293 --> 17:17.123
Like the part where you
left me alone

17:17.166 --> 17:21.214
to take care of Mom
who was slowly losing her mind.

17:21.257 --> 17:24.521
- This is unbelievable.
- Vanessa.

17:24.565 --> 17:27.046
I had to leave.

17:28.482 --> 17:30.266
- Melanie, I called,

17:30.310 --> 17:33.269
and I begged you
to come back and help,

17:33.313 --> 17:35.793
and all you would say is,
"I'll be home soon."

17:35.837 --> 17:37.665
But you never came.

17:38.405 --> 17:43.410
And my entire life stopped
while I took care of Mom alone.

17:46.935 --> 17:49.024
- Oh, Mom.

17:50.634 --> 17:52.114
Sorry.

17:53.637 --> 17:54.986
- It's okay, sweetie.

17:57.032 --> 17:59.426
[thunder booming]

18:06.563 --> 18:09.653
- This is some crazy...
- No shit.

18:09.697 --> 18:13.004
I did not expect to hear some
mess like this. Top me up.

18:21.970 --> 18:23.711
- Thank you, honey.

18:27.845 --> 18:29.934
[tense music]

18:32.894 --> 18:35.679
[clearing throat]
Where the hell

18:35.723 --> 18:38.813
is my antique Georgian
Chinoiserie engraved

18:38.856 --> 18:40.728
facet-cut
crystal wine glass?

18:40.771 --> 18:42.991
- It's not in there?
- Huh, okay.

18:43.034 --> 18:45.124
Nobody's seen it, huh?

18:45.167 --> 18:47.082
Well then, somebody better
call Social Services,

18:47.126 --> 18:50.216
'cause there's a child in
danger. I'm about to kill one.

18:51.782 --> 18:53.610
Jesus.

18:54.655 --> 18:56.483
[laughing]

18:57.745 --> 19:00.182
- I told you,
all bark and no bite.

19:00.226 --> 19:02.750
- My God.
- What did you do?

19:05.231 --> 19:07.537
I hope she busts you
in your ass.

19:07.581 --> 19:11.585
- What's your problem?
You used to think hiding her
glasses was funny.

19:11.628 --> 19:12.847
- Not anymore.

19:13.848 --> 19:14.979
I'm hungry.

19:16.459 --> 19:17.982
- Forget him.

19:22.030 --> 19:24.641
Ugh, damn it! Almost 80 degrees.

19:24.685 --> 19:27.688
The temperature's climbing
faster than I thought!

19:27.731 --> 19:29.864
- Honey, stop looking at it!

19:29.907 --> 19:32.040
- Ooh, look what I got!

19:32.083 --> 19:35.652
- Hey! Our old fondue pot.
I used to love that thing.

19:35.696 --> 19:37.959
- Mom, remember when
you'd put it out on cold nights

19:38.002 --> 19:39.787
and we'd have fondue
while watching

19:39.830 --> 19:42.616
one of Christian's old movies
that he picked out?

19:42.659 --> 19:45.096
- Yep, and he would have
a tantrum

19:45.140 --> 19:47.838
if we didn't all agree
to watch Uptown Saturday Night!

19:47.882 --> 19:49.884
- For the 100th time.
[laughing]

19:49.927 --> 19:54.236
- Bridgette, remember
when you ate all the cheese

19:54.280 --> 19:57.979
earlier in the day,
and then, you panicked

19:58.022 --> 20:00.677
when Mom was looking for it
to make the fondue?

20:00.721 --> 20:05.204
- I was so scared that I filled
the pot with my art paste!

20:05.247 --> 20:07.728
Aunt Vanessa grounded me
for a month.

20:07.771 --> 20:09.382
[laughing]

20:09.425 --> 20:12.211
- Christian was sick for a week.
- Aww.

20:12.254 --> 20:16.302
- Took me forever to get
the paste out of that thing.
That is the same pot.

20:16.345 --> 20:19.914
- No! Dana, throw some of that
cheese in there,

20:19.957 --> 20:22.264
a little white wine,
and fire that baby up.

20:22.308 --> 20:23.961
- Yes!
- Mm-mm.

20:24.005 --> 20:27.487
I am not one of your
pillow princesses. You do it.

20:27.530 --> 20:29.880
- What the hell was that?
Do you have a problem with me?

20:29.924 --> 20:31.534
- Yeah, Dana,
what's wrong with you?

20:31.578 --> 20:33.101
- Nothing.

20:35.625 --> 20:37.584
- I'll deal with it.
It's fine, got it.

20:40.500 --> 20:44.765
[sighing]
- Hey, how you feeling?

20:44.808 --> 20:46.897
- I'm fine, baby.

20:48.290 --> 20:49.683
- Can I ask you something?

20:51.380 --> 20:53.730
Why did you ignore Aunt Vanessa
when she asked for your help?

20:53.774 --> 20:55.602
- I couldn't deal with it.

20:55.645 --> 20:58.735
I was too young to process
what was happening,

20:58.779 --> 21:00.998
and I could never find closure

21:01.042 --> 21:04.001
because I promised our mother
that I'd never tell anyone.

21:04.567 --> 21:06.308
- Did you think I wouldn't
believe you?

21:06.352 --> 21:08.963
If I'd have known the truth
about what happened,

21:09.006 --> 21:11.182
things could've been a whole lot
better between us.

21:11.226 --> 21:13.707
- I know that now,
but at the time,

21:13.750 --> 21:16.884
all I could think about
was that I just wanted
to be a normal teenager.

21:16.927 --> 21:20.583
Go to the football games,
go on dates, to the prom.

21:20.627 --> 21:23.107
- Yeah, we both could've had
that if you'd have just come
home and helped.

21:23.151 --> 21:25.936
But instead, I withered away
caring for a disabled mother,

21:25.980 --> 21:28.809
putting off college, life.

21:28.852 --> 21:31.855
And that wasn't the worst of it.
- What happened?

21:32.856 --> 21:36.251
- Your grandmother,
she just eventually
got to a point

21:36.295 --> 21:39.559
where she started losing
all sense of reason.

21:39.602 --> 21:41.387
She didn't know who or where
she was half the time.

21:41.430 --> 21:44.085
- Makes sense. I mean,

21:44.128 --> 21:46.305
she thought I was my mother
when we went to see her.

21:46.348 --> 21:49.786
- Yes. One time,
I came home from school,

21:49.830 --> 21:52.485
and she was outside
talking to herself,

21:52.528 --> 21:55.662
roaming up and down the street
in her bra and panties.

21:55.705 --> 21:57.751
- Oh, my God.

21:57.794 --> 22:00.406
So our grandmother
literally snapped.

22:00.449 --> 22:03.060
- I always knew
this family had issues,

22:03.104 --> 22:05.585
but I did not realize
how deep.

22:05.628 --> 22:07.978
- I was 18 at the time.

22:09.153 --> 22:11.547
Old enough to be
her conservator.

22:11.591 --> 22:14.855
It was a hard decision,
but I finally had her committed.

22:14.898 --> 22:16.944
- And that's when I came home,

22:16.987 --> 22:19.729
and we promised each other that
we'd move on with our lives,

22:19.773 --> 22:22.428
and we'd never
talk about it again.

22:22.471 --> 22:23.951
To anyone.

22:23.994 --> 22:26.780
- I just don't get this. Why?

22:26.823 --> 22:30.523
- Because that's the way
people dealt with mental illness
back then.

22:30.566 --> 22:34.657
- It was easier for us
to bury it in the lie

22:34.701 --> 22:38.008
of her living in Paris
than to think about the truth
of where she really was.

22:38.052 --> 22:39.749
- Just like that?

22:39.793 --> 22:41.403
No thought as to whether or not

22:41.447 --> 22:43.405
this secret would affect
your kids?

22:43.449 --> 22:44.928
- Dana.

22:44.972 --> 22:47.104
- The lie was more hurtful
than the truth.

22:47.148 --> 22:50.847
- Sorry, guys. There's not as
much shame attached to it now.

22:50.891 --> 22:52.806
- Well, mentally ill or not,

22:52.849 --> 22:55.243
we would have loved
to have her in our lives.

22:55.286 --> 22:57.376
- To be honest, I don't think
we thought about anything

22:57.419 --> 23:00.291
but putting out the fire that
was directly in front of us.

23:00.335 --> 23:01.423
[sighing]

23:02.946 --> 23:07.342
Vanessa... I know I can never
erase the hurt and pain

23:07.386 --> 23:10.389
that you endured taking care
of Mom all by yourself,

23:10.432 --> 23:12.391
but I am truly sorry.

23:13.174 --> 23:17.396
I'm just glad that
the truth is finally out,
and that you believe me.

23:19.528 --> 23:21.487
- Well, this is great, guys.

23:21.530 --> 23:25.055
First step to healing
is dealing with the truth.

23:25.099 --> 23:27.406
- We have a long way to go,

23:27.449 --> 23:29.190
but at least we're on
the right road.

23:29.233 --> 23:32.149
- Before we go on a road trip,
can we at least eat first?

23:32.193 --> 23:34.021
[chuckling]
- Mm, yeah.

23:36.197 --> 23:37.503
[sighing]

23:40.767 --> 23:43.465
- I can forgive you
for Mom, Melanie.

23:44.727 --> 23:47.295
But there is one thing
I can't forgive you for.

23:48.514 --> 23:51.168
Having an affair
with my husband.

23:51.212 --> 23:54.476
- Oh, shit.
- I am done apologizing!

23:54.520 --> 23:56.391
- Well, I am not done.

23:56.435 --> 23:59.350
I thought about it
and I thought about it.

23:59.394 --> 24:03.050
You slept with him because
he reminded you of Dad.

24:03.093 --> 24:06.314
- That is insane!
- Don't gaslight me.

24:06.357 --> 24:08.708
That's what this is all about.

24:08.751 --> 24:11.754
You have some deep-seated
Oedipal complex

24:11.798 --> 24:14.017
that you never
worked through in therapy.

24:14.061 --> 24:15.584
And that's the truth!

24:15.628 --> 24:18.369
You want to go to church?
I'll take you there!

24:20.850 --> 24:22.896
[thunder rumbling]

24:26.900 --> 24:28.945
- Have you lost your mind?

24:28.989 --> 24:30.817
You really need help!

24:30.860 --> 24:32.949
- Stop deflecting, Melanie.

24:32.993 --> 24:35.604
Reggie had every
idiosyncrasy of our father.

24:35.648 --> 24:37.780
He looked like him,
he laughed like him,

24:37.824 --> 24:41.523
he even talked like him.
- Reggie was nothing like Dad.

24:41.567 --> 24:43.394
- Mom, do we really have
to do this right now?

24:43.438 --> 24:46.397
- No, it is time, honey.
It is time to expose her

24:46.441 --> 24:48.095
for the schemer
that she really is.

24:48.138 --> 24:49.705
- So it's all my mom's fault?

24:49.749 --> 24:52.969
- Fine. Reggie's spirit
reminded me of Dad's,

24:53.013 --> 24:55.624
but I never chased
after your husband.

24:55.668 --> 24:59.846
- Oh, please! You were
all over him the minute
I brought him home!

24:59.889 --> 25:03.371
You obsessed over him!
You wanted what I had, Melanie.

25:03.414 --> 25:05.678
- Mom, Mom, Mom. That's enough.

25:05.721 --> 25:08.898
We are not rehashing this again.
You just made up!

25:08.942 --> 25:11.553
- I thought it was
an innocent crush.

25:11.597 --> 25:14.469
- I am warning you, Vanessa,
you are pushing me too far.

25:14.513 --> 25:18.299
- I never thought
that you would open your legs
and throw it at him.

25:18.342 --> 25:21.955
- Oh, honey. I didn't have
to throw anything at him.

25:21.998 --> 25:25.524
He asked for it, gently.

25:26.699 --> 25:29.310
Softly.
- Okay, okay!

25:29.353 --> 25:31.747
Melanie, stop it!
- Cut that shit out!

25:31.791 --> 25:35.272
- Enough! Mom, please!
Can we just move past this?!

25:35.316 --> 25:37.971
- That's right.
I brought your daughter
to see our psychotic mother,

25:38.014 --> 25:41.714
and I would do it all again
if it meant watching it
destroy you.

25:41.757 --> 25:45.195
I want you to feel
the same misery and hurt
you put me through!

25:45.239 --> 25:50.200
- Always the victim!
Okay, you want to play?
Then let's play.

25:50.244 --> 25:51.724
- No! No!

25:51.767 --> 25:53.769
Let's remember, we're ladies.

25:53.813 --> 25:56.119
- Too late for that.
Let them finish.

26:00.689 --> 26:04.563
- I only slept with Reginald
one time before he married
your aunt,

26:04.606 --> 26:06.173
and that's when we had you.

26:06.216 --> 26:08.654
But the real affair
didn't start until Vanessa

26:08.697 --> 26:11.395
walked out on Reggie,
August, and Dana.

26:11.439 --> 26:13.397
- Wait, what is she
talking about?

26:13.441 --> 26:16.270
- I don't know. Mom?
What's going on?

26:16.313 --> 26:18.925
- I never walked out
on you guys.

26:18.968 --> 26:20.927
Your father and I
had an agreement.

26:20.970 --> 26:23.582
- Oh, is that what
we're calling it?

26:24.234 --> 26:28.935
- We decided that I would go
back on air, follow my dreams.

26:28.978 --> 26:30.632
He supported me.

26:30.676 --> 26:34.288
- Is that how you justify
leaving your two kids behind

26:34.331 --> 26:36.769
while you play journalist?
That's right, Vanessa.

26:36.812 --> 26:40.250
You forgot I was there, didn't
you? Picking up the pieces.

26:40.294 --> 26:43.297
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.
I don't know about any of this.

26:43.340 --> 26:45.995
- Your mother sold you kids out
for her career.

26:46.039 --> 26:48.868
She pretended
all was forgiven between us,

26:48.911 --> 26:51.174
so I stood in and played Mommy

26:51.218 --> 26:53.655
while she gallivanted off
to find herself.

26:53.699 --> 26:55.918
- You are way out of line,
Melanie.

26:55.962 --> 26:58.399
- And so were you, when you took
Bridgette to see Mom,

26:58.442 --> 26:59.966
so I guess we're even!

27:06.712 --> 27:08.365
- Mom?

27:08.409 --> 27:10.672
What is Aunt Melanie saying?

27:10.716 --> 27:12.674
Tell us this isn't true!

27:12.718 --> 27:15.111
- Your Aunt Melanie framed
the situation all wrong.

27:15.155 --> 27:17.592
- So, you didn't leave us?
- I took some time

27:17.636 --> 27:20.595
away from motherhood to test
the waters of my career.

27:20.639 --> 27:23.772
- So you did leave us.
- Don't say it like that.

27:23.816 --> 27:25.687
- Well, is there any other way
to say it?

27:25.731 --> 27:27.297
- Why don't I remember
that happening?

27:27.341 --> 27:29.343
- Because I wasn't gone
that long.

27:29.386 --> 27:32.607
- Long enough for Aunt Melanie
to step in and play Mommy.

27:32.651 --> 27:34.435
And you didn't have
a problem with that?

27:34.478 --> 27:36.785
- Apparently not.
- Let me explain.

27:36.829 --> 27:41.442
- Why? You are always pretending
to be the perfect mother!

27:41.485 --> 27:44.445
The "every Friday night
is movie night,

27:44.488 --> 27:48.492
I'm giving my kids everything
because I'm only as happy
as they are" Mom!

27:48.536 --> 27:50.538
[breathing heavily]

27:52.714 --> 27:55.717
This is too much.
You are too much.

27:55.761 --> 28:00.243
- I love you guys with
everything I have inside me.

28:00.287 --> 28:01.201
- Why did you go?

28:02.158 --> 28:04.508
- I... I was young.

28:04.552 --> 28:08.338
I tried my best to embrace
motherhood, but I got scared.

28:08.382 --> 28:12.995
You know, I lost my identity,
I just... I lost myself.

28:13.039 --> 28:17.870
Becoming Mrs. Reginald King
quickly replaced Vanessa Pierce,
and it...

28:17.913 --> 28:19.436
It terrified me.

28:20.350 --> 28:21.656
- Where did you go?

28:21.700 --> 28:23.614
- An old colleague
offered me a job.

28:23.658 --> 28:26.095
I knew her from
my pre-marriage days

28:26.139 --> 28:27.749
at the News Station in Oakland.

28:27.793 --> 28:30.186
She moved up to producer
in Tallahassee,

28:30.230 --> 28:33.494
and she needed another female
anchor, so she called.

28:33.537 --> 28:35.626
Unfortunately, the job was
out of town,

28:35.670 --> 28:39.761
so I made the difficult
decision, and I took the job,

28:39.805 --> 28:42.068
hoping that it would,
I don't know,

28:42.111 --> 28:44.418
fill this empty hole
inside of me.

28:44.461 --> 28:48.117
- And did it?
- I loved my job.

28:48.161 --> 28:52.295
I was a Black woman news anchor
on the evening news.

28:52.339 --> 28:55.995
And this is before the Joy Reid
and Robin Roberts of the world.

28:56.038 --> 28:58.345
Yes, there were others
like me coming up.

28:58.388 --> 29:01.261
There was Carol Simpson
and Jane Kennedy.

29:01.304 --> 29:04.786
We knew that our voices
would make a difference

29:04.830 --> 29:07.920
on how stories were told
about our people!

29:07.963 --> 29:10.096
We just... We changed the world.

29:10.139 --> 29:12.185
- So you were a low-key
activist?

29:12.228 --> 29:15.014
- I tried, honey. But I...

29:15.884 --> 29:20.715
I just missed
you guys desperately,
so I had to come home.

29:20.759 --> 29:22.543
- But why didn't you
ever tell us?

29:22.586 --> 29:24.501
- I don't know.

29:25.459 --> 29:26.895
Guilt.

29:26.939 --> 29:29.332
I just thought
it would go away.

29:29.376 --> 29:32.292
- Mom, things never go away.

29:32.335 --> 29:33.859
How could you do all of that

29:33.902 --> 29:35.817
and know how much
I love my career

29:35.861 --> 29:38.167
and still constantly be
in my ear about having a baby?

29:38.211 --> 29:40.691
Because what gets me, Mom,

29:40.735 --> 29:43.956
is that you know how difficult
it is for women to have both.

29:43.999 --> 29:46.306
You know that
there is no balance,

29:46.349 --> 29:48.830
and I know you know that,
because you lived it.

29:48.874 --> 29:52.355
Why couldn't you just be honest
with me instead of...

29:52.399 --> 29:55.489
instead of being a hypocrite?

29:55.532 --> 29:58.144
- August, I didn't mean--
- You didn't mean to what?

29:58.187 --> 30:01.016
Cause that much pressure on me
all the time?

30:01.060 --> 30:03.540
Do you know that you bring me
so much anxiety

30:03.584 --> 30:06.282
that sometimes I can't even
see straight?!

30:06.326 --> 30:09.459
That there is not one day
that goes by

30:09.503 --> 30:11.679
that you don't let me know
how disappointed you are

30:11.722 --> 30:13.463
that I haven't popped out
a baby yet?!

30:13.507 --> 30:15.291
- August...

30:15.335 --> 30:19.992
My babies are the only thing
in life that bring me pure joy,

30:20.035 --> 30:23.169
and the reason that
I keep asking you guys
about having kids

30:23.212 --> 30:25.606
is because I just want you
to be as happy as I am.

30:25.649 --> 30:28.435
- Mom. Who says I'm not happy?

30:28.478 --> 30:32.091
Believe it or not, I don't want
to walk your exact path.

30:32.134 --> 30:36.138
Having kids isn't a part
of my journey right now.

30:36.182 --> 30:40.708
And this time, this is
a different moment for women.

30:40.751 --> 30:43.232
Having kids, having a husband,

30:43.276 --> 30:45.452
they are no longer required
to make a woman whole.

30:45.495 --> 30:48.237
And maybe they didn't get that
in your generation,

30:48.281 --> 30:49.804
or in the generations previous,

30:49.848 --> 30:52.024
but I actually
love my job too, Mom.

30:52.894 --> 30:55.549
I love running this place.

30:55.592 --> 30:57.290
- I hear you, honey.

30:57.333 --> 30:59.379
And I will do better.

30:59.422 --> 31:03.557
You guys, you are both
so much further along

31:03.600 --> 31:06.386
than me when I was your age.
Trust me.

31:06.429 --> 31:09.389
You are so confident,
so self-evolved.

31:09.432 --> 31:11.913
You know, when I finally found
that confidence in myself,

31:11.957 --> 31:14.089
I was able to focus on my family

31:14.133 --> 31:16.918
and dedicate myself
to smoothing out our marriage.

31:16.962 --> 31:18.659
- Are you sure, Mom?

31:18.702 --> 31:21.357
Because what I heard out there
was not very convincing.

31:21.401 --> 31:23.098
- Yes, honey.

31:23.620 --> 31:25.274
It took some work,

31:25.318 --> 31:28.016
but eventually, we landed
in a good place.

31:28.060 --> 31:30.932
And then, Christian was born.

31:30.976 --> 31:34.414
And while he may be a pain
in the ass to you guys,

31:34.457 --> 31:37.634
to me, he was the cherry on top.

31:37.678 --> 31:41.421
And I love you.
I love you both so much.

31:44.032 --> 31:45.033
Come here.

31:46.469 --> 31:48.254
[phone chiming]

31:49.429 --> 31:50.952
- Oh, shoot.
I have cell service.

31:50.996 --> 31:52.911
- Oh, wow! Maybe they're working
on the power.

31:52.954 --> 31:54.738
- Dana, what is it?

31:55.522 --> 31:57.089
- Nothing.

31:57.132 --> 31:59.265
- Is it Rose? Is she okay?

31:59.308 --> 32:02.137
- No, she's not. We're not.

32:02.181 --> 32:03.791
- Well, Dana, what's going on?

32:05.184 --> 32:06.925
- Why does it matter?

32:06.968 --> 32:09.057
You can't keep
sprinkling glitter on shit

32:09.101 --> 32:10.450
to make it look pretty.

32:10.493 --> 32:13.801
Guess what, Mom?
It still stinks.

32:14.367 --> 32:16.456
You and Dad had
a dysfunctional marriage,

32:16.499 --> 32:19.546
and you never gave us any honest
examples on how to do things.

32:19.589 --> 32:21.722
That's why Rose and I
are in this situation now.

32:21.765 --> 32:23.898
- Dana,
that's not completely fair.

32:24.899 --> 32:28.337
- Situation? Dana,
why didn't you tell me

32:28.381 --> 32:30.818
that you were having problems?
- Because they're my problems.

32:30.861 --> 32:33.255
- Well, what's going on?
Talk to me.

32:35.127 --> 32:37.868
- She left.
- She what?

32:39.000 --> 32:40.132
- She left.

32:41.655 --> 32:43.352
I don't know what to do.

32:46.529 --> 32:48.879
- I can't believe
the nerve of her.

32:48.923 --> 32:50.925
- Aunt Vanessa may have
left her family,

32:50.969 --> 32:52.753
but at least she came home
to them.

32:54.059 --> 32:55.974
Why didn't you come home to me?

32:57.279 --> 32:58.977
- Oh, honey.

33:03.894 --> 33:06.723
Working as a nurse
in Burkina Faso

33:06.767 --> 33:08.769
helped feed my soul,
Bridgette.

33:08.812 --> 33:12.381
Something I desperately needed
to move forward in life.

33:12.425 --> 33:15.428
But what was good for my life
wasn't good for yours.

33:15.471 --> 33:17.734
You needed some stability.

33:17.778 --> 33:21.651
A home, a family.
You had that here.

33:21.695 --> 33:23.305
- And I couldn't have gotten
that from you?

33:23.349 --> 33:25.481
- Honey, I didn't have it
to give.

33:25.525 --> 33:27.701
When Vanessa came home,

33:28.876 --> 33:32.793
the guilt of the affair
was too much for me to bear,

33:32.836 --> 33:37.624
and it all coincided with
the lawsuit and the settlement.

33:38.538 --> 33:42.846
I needed to get out of here
and get a fresh start.

33:44.500 --> 33:49.810
But I realize now
that leaving you here was wrong.

33:51.290 --> 33:53.901
Baby, I'm so sorry.

33:56.251 --> 33:59.037
- Mom, I'm trying,
but it's really hard.

34:00.168 --> 34:03.432
I've been abandoned
so many times.

34:03.476 --> 34:06.827
I feel like a repellent
for everything that I love.

34:06.870 --> 34:11.049
First you, then August,
and now...

34:12.789 --> 34:15.662
- What? What is it, honey?

34:17.925 --> 34:20.101
- There's a woman that I like,

34:20.145 --> 34:22.843
but I don't know
how she feels about me.

34:22.886 --> 34:26.890
- What? Have you told her
how you feel?

34:28.153 --> 34:30.068
- I haven't had the opportunity.

34:31.373 --> 34:32.896
She's married.

34:33.897 --> 34:37.075
- Oh. Oh, honey.

34:37.118 --> 34:38.989
- I don't want to do
to her marriage

34:39.033 --> 34:41.470
what you did to Aunt Vanessa's
and my dad's.

34:45.474 --> 34:48.129
- Have you talked to my wife?
Don't lie to me.

34:48.173 --> 34:50.827
I know you two are besties now.
Are you screwing her?

34:50.871 --> 34:53.917
- Dana, screwing?
We're just friends.

34:53.961 --> 34:56.181
- I don't believe you.
- Dana.

34:56.224 --> 34:57.921
They wouldn't do that,
we're family.

34:57.965 --> 34:59.271
[phone chiming]

34:59.314 --> 35:01.142
Oh, good,
you're getting texts too.

35:01.186 --> 35:03.318
Maybe I can call 911
and get us out of here.

35:04.058 --> 35:06.278
- Oh, Rose!

35:07.235 --> 35:10.325
"Thanks for the text, love.
It made me feel a lot better.

35:10.369 --> 35:12.849
I'm in New York and I miss you
too." Heart emoji?

35:12.893 --> 35:15.678
This is more than a friendship.
- Oh, my God.

35:15.722 --> 35:19.465
- Bridgette. What's going on?
- He's tripping!

35:19.508 --> 35:21.902
- Bullshit. I don't trust you.

35:21.945 --> 35:23.947
You're on a mission
to destroy this family.

35:25.210 --> 35:27.560
- What is he talking about?
- Nothing.

35:28.169 --> 35:30.345
- Melanie, did you know
about this?

35:30.389 --> 35:33.348
[overlapping arguments]

35:37.265 --> 35:38.745
- That's enough, guys.
That's enough.

35:38.788 --> 35:42.227
That's enough, guys!
Everyone, shut up!

35:42.270 --> 35:43.924
Shut the hell up!

35:43.967 --> 35:45.665
[crying]

35:50.191 --> 35:52.498
[thunder rumbling]

36:01.115 --> 36:03.073
How did we get here?

36:03.117 --> 36:06.381
Because people aren't just
born the way they are.

36:06.425 --> 36:09.776
- We're cursed.
- No, no, no, no.

36:09.819 --> 36:12.909
We're not cursed.
I mean, good or bad,

36:12.953 --> 36:15.042
everybody takes something
from the environment

36:15.085 --> 36:16.696
that they're raised in,
and they pass it down.

36:16.739 --> 36:20.265
And the Kings, I mean,
we're a bunch of...

36:20.308 --> 36:24.617
backstabbing, paranoid liars.

36:25.661 --> 36:28.621
And at the same time, we would
kill and die for each other.

36:30.144 --> 36:32.451
And the two seem to be...

36:32.494 --> 36:34.975
cancelling each other out
right now.

36:35.018 --> 36:37.238
Aren't you guys tired of this?

36:37.282 --> 36:39.240
The lies, the distrust,
the hate.

36:39.284 --> 36:41.721
We are all broken because of it.

36:44.811 --> 36:45.986
Dana.

36:46.856 --> 36:48.423
Trust your wife.

36:49.294 --> 36:51.426
Rose loves you,
and you know that.

36:51.470 --> 36:54.255
And maybe she needs
a little space right now,

36:54.299 --> 36:58.085
but Rose has been your ride
or die from day one.

36:59.391 --> 37:01.741
Why would she be
any different now?

37:01.784 --> 37:04.874
- Bridge, I think you need
to make a little space

37:04.918 --> 37:06.702
in your heart
to forgive your mom.

37:06.746 --> 37:10.576
I'm sorry, but all I ever see
is her reaching out to you.

37:10.619 --> 37:14.101
Maybe you try and reach
back out, for a change.

37:16.495 --> 37:20.890
Mom, Auntie, the past is
in the past.

37:20.934 --> 37:23.328
You need to leave it there
and move forward,

37:23.371 --> 37:26.069
because we need you. I need you.

37:26.113 --> 37:30.248
Right now I am facing the
biggest challenge of my life,

37:30.291 --> 37:32.946
and honestly,
I'm really, really scared.

37:32.989 --> 37:36.036
My fear of failure is so real,

37:36.079 --> 37:40.954
because this can mean
losing everything we have,
and if we do...

37:42.129 --> 37:43.913
...it's my fault.

37:43.957 --> 37:48.440
And I can't tell you how often
that keeps me up at night.

37:49.658 --> 37:52.661
And the only thing that keeps me
from freaking out

37:52.705 --> 37:56.839
is the fact that I have a solid
foundation in the two of you.

37:58.276 --> 38:00.539
But if that has cracks,

38:00.582 --> 38:02.715
I'm scared I'm gonna fall
right through,

38:02.758 --> 38:07.937
because Daddy left
a huge space to fill,

38:07.981 --> 38:12.464
and right now, I'm just trying
to figure out how to fill it,

38:12.507 --> 38:16.729
and I need the help of
all of you. I need my family.

38:21.516 --> 38:25.172
- We hear you, honey.
- Do you?

38:25.215 --> 38:28.610
- Mm-hmm.
- Because we are Kings.

38:28.654 --> 38:31.221
We are royalty.

38:31.265 --> 38:34.747
And we need to use this energy
to lift each other up,

38:34.790 --> 38:37.793
not tear each other down, right?
[all]: Yes. Yes.

38:37.837 --> 38:40.230
- Yes?! Great.
[laughing]

38:40.274 --> 38:45.366
Because we need to get back
to rebuilding this company

38:45.410 --> 38:47.890
and continue that badass legacy

38:47.934 --> 38:50.545
that Reginald and
Vanessa King started.

38:50.589 --> 38:52.852
[beeping]

38:53.766 --> 38:56.116
Finally! Ah, finally!

38:56.159 --> 38:57.683
Oh, my God, finally!

38:59.075 --> 39:01.208
- Free at last.

39:01.251 --> 39:03.166
- Alright, Bridge,
what's it say?

39:03.210 --> 39:05.386
- 86.5 degrees!

39:05.430 --> 39:08.737
By the skin of our asses,
we saved the dessert wine!

39:08.781 --> 39:09.782
- Yes!
- Yes!

39:09.825 --> 39:12.088
[cheering]

39:14.526 --> 39:16.005
- Bridge, Bridge,
this is you, right?

39:16.049 --> 39:17.267
- Yes!
[laughing]

39:17.311 --> 39:18.878
- Down it.

39:20.358 --> 39:21.837
- So, how about us?

39:22.838 --> 39:25.711
You ready to forgive me?
- Oh...

39:26.886 --> 39:29.715
Baby steps?
- I'll take that.

39:29.758 --> 39:31.281
[chuckling]

39:37.462 --> 39:39.594
- Hey, Dana.

39:39.638 --> 39:42.510
Can we talk?
- We're good.

39:45.252 --> 39:47.341
- Oh, don't you want
to put her glass back?

39:47.385 --> 39:49.474
- Oh, well. I just want her
to wonder about it

39:49.517 --> 39:51.127
for a little while.
