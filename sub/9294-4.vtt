WEBVTT

00:10.290 --> 00:12.170
PREVIOUSLY ON 24

00:12.650 --> 00:13.549
Tanner.

00:13.550 --> 00:15.059
Emerson spoke to his man inside the bureau.

00:15.060 --> 00:16.889
He says you're clear. Good.

00:16.890 --> 00:18.449
Look, I need to prep my men on the nt job,

00:18.450 --> 00:20.220
So why don't you tell me what we need.

00:20.220 --> 00:22.180
I'll give you the specs when I get there.

00:22.420 --> 00:24.210
I'll engage him. Cover my flank.

00:25.220 --> 00:26.570
I can handle it.

00:30.470 --> 00:31.329
I don't understand.

00:31.330 --> 00:33.549
Almeida was orchestrating these attacks.

00:33.550 --> 00:36.099
If he doest n've the cip device, who does?

00:36.100 --> 00:38.220
Almeida's working for the juma regime.

00:38.430 --> 00:40.570
This is colonel ike dubaku.

00:40.720 --> 00:42.859
We demand an immediate withdrawal

00:42.860 --> 00:45.069
Of the u.S. Naval strike force

00:45.070 --> 00:46.940
By this time tomorrow...

00:47.420 --> 00:49.980
The american troops are still in position near our country.

00:50.440 --> 00:52.899
President taylor just received your demands.

00:52.900 --> 00:53.969
The perhaps it is time

00:53.970 --> 00:56.240
For a more forceful demonstration.

00:56.350 --> 00:58.099
I know about samantha roth.

00:58.100 --> 01:00.949
She's hiding something about my son's murder.

01:00.950 --> 01:02.299
Roger wasn't murdered.

01:02.300 --> 01:04.239
I wasn't completely honest with you.

01:04.239 --> 01:05.209
What do you mean?

01:05.209 --> 01:07.590
Roger didn't commit suicide, mr. Taylor.

01:08.180 --> 01:09.409
He was murdered.

01:09.410 --> 01:11.490
Jack, tony is not a terrorist.

01:11.620 --> 01:12.609
He's working with me.

01:12.610 --> 01:14.479
We're working outside the government.

01:14.480 --> 01:15.339
That's why we have

01:15.340 --> 01:17.689
To get tony back undercover.

01:17.690 --> 01:19.460
Bauer, you're going to make it out of here.

01:19.680 --> 01:20.599
Shut up.

01:20.600 --> 01:22.010
I said shut up

01:23.370 --> 01:24.740
Get down!

01:26.140 --> 01:27.929
We got to get you out of here and back undercover.

01:27.930 --> 01:29.210
Go!

01:31.000 --> 01:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:40.950 --> 01:42.490
Tony, let's go!

01:55.340 --> 02:00.580
The following takes place between 11 a.M. And 12 p.M.

02:05.070 --> 02:08.229
Renee, security saw Bauer and Almeida

02:08.229 --> 02:09.799
Getting into a dark-colored panel van.

02:09.800 --> 02:11.790
What direction were they heading? West.

02:12.360 --> 02:13.629
What's happening with td.O.T. Cameras?

02:13.630 --> 02:15.919
I've been trying. Traffic images aren't loading.

02:15.920 --> 02:17.199
What do you mean not g?Lo

02:17.200 --> 02:18.009
Just what I said.

02:18.010 --> 02:19.039
The server's not responding.

02:19.040 --> 02:20.789
The hacker must be jamming the transmission.

02:20.790 --> 02:21.979
How the hell can they do that?

02:21.980 --> 02:23.509
Well, if I knew, I'd be able to get around it.

02:23.510 --> 02:25.289
Continue checking ancillary security cams,

02:25.290 --> 02:26.449
Atms, parking garages--

02:26.450 --> 02:27.910
There has to be something.

02:28.290 --> 02:30.129
Well, keep canvassing the area.

02:30.130 --> 02:31.379
Someone else may have seen the vehicle.

02:31.380 --> 02:33.950
That... Fine. Let me know.

02:34.530 --> 02:36.179
No luck on municipal cameras.

02:36.180 --> 02:37.999
Looks like they have someone running interference for them.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.099
Damn it.

02:39.100 --> 02:40.579
Bauer must have worked out this escape

02:40.580 --> 02:42.129
With almeida's people.

02:42.130 --> 02:43.679
I'm so sorry, larry.

02:43.680 --> 02:44.849
That son of a bitch played me.

02:44.850 --> 02:46.699
Had me believing the bureau was compromised--

02:46.700 --> 02:48.169
Someone on the inside working against us.

02:48.170 --> 02:49.719
I realize it was him

02:49.720 --> 02:51.879
Don't put this yourself.

02:51.880 --> 02:52.689
He played us both.

02:52.690 --> 02:53.829
No, I should have seen it.

02:53.830 --> 02:55.129
This is fine, take it downstairs.

02:55.130 --> 02:58.009
Bailer's facing a federal indictment-- years in prison.

02:58.010 --> 02:59.969
Almeida must have offered him a way out.

02:59.970 --> 03:01.209
Agent moss...

03:01.210 --> 03:02.899
The white house is on line one.

03:02.900 --> 03:04.279
I'll, uh, take it in the conference room.

03:04.280 --> 03:05.620
Thanks, erica.

03:06.400 --> 03:08.150
I'm going to make this right, larry.

03:08.780 --> 03:09.669
Whatever it takes,

03:09.670 --> 03:11.449
I will find bauer and almeida.

03:11.450 --> 03:13.209
Well, throw in a cip device,

03:13.210 --> 03:14.809
And maybe we'll be off the hook.

03:14.810 --> 03:16.429
Janis, what's the status of that shooter?

03:16.430 --> 03:17.999
He hasn't regained consciousness yet.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.040
But a print match is just coming up now.

03:22.360 --> 03:24.329
His name is alan tanner.

03:24.330 --> 03:26.149
He was former special forces,

03:26.150 --> 03:28.239
Discharged after desert storm.

03:28.240 --> 03:30.409
Discharged why? Medical reasons.

03:30.410 --> 03:33.319
He made claims to having gulf war syndrome.

03:33.320 --> 03:34.689
Tried to sue the government,

03:34.690 --> 03:36.239
Case was dismissed.

03:36.240 --> 03:38.640
I want to be informed the minute he's awake.

03:41.940 --> 03:43.900
I'm connecting you now.

03:44.620 --> 03:47.039
Agent moss, this is ethan kanin.

03:47.040 --> 03:48.630
I'm here with the president.

03:49.030 --> 03:50.549
What are you and your folks doing

03:50.550 --> 03:51.629
About the situation?

03:51.630 --> 03:53.429
We put out an all-agency alert.

03:53.430 --> 03:55.219
Everyone understands apprehending almeida

03:55.220 --> 03:56.229
Is our top priority.

03:56.230 --> 03:57.900
How did he escape?

03:58.340 --> 04:00.889
He had the help of a former ctu agent

04:00.890 --> 04:02.489
That we mistakenly trusted.

04:02.490 --> 04:04.249
A man by the name of jack bauer.

04:04.250 --> 04:05.630
Bauer?!

04:05.640 --> 04:06.689
I thought he was in the middle

04:06.690 --> 04:08.489
Of a senate investigative hearing.

04:08.490 --> 04:09.629
Yes, sir, that is correct.

04:09.630 --> 04:11.969
We issued a subpoena a few hours ago, excusing him

04:11.970 --> 04:13.399
From the hearings in order to enlist his help

04:13.400 --> 04:15.040
In apprehending almeida.

04:15.340 --> 04:17.819
Now you're saying that these two men are allie

04:17.820 --> 04:18.928
It would appear so.

04:18.930 --> 04:21.478
My god... You and your people

04:21.480 --> 04:24.029
Have royally screwed up, agent moss!

04:24.030 --> 04:26.909
Without almeida, we have no way of finding dubaku

04:26.910 --> 04:29.209
And no chance of recovering the cip device.

04:29.210 --> 04:30.719
Ethan, let's stay on point.

04:30.720 --> 04:33.429
Agent moss, are you working any other leads?

04:33.430 --> 04:34.509
Yes, madame president.

04:34.510 --> 04:37.419
A confederate of almeida's who was wounded earlier today.

04:37.420 --> 04:38.689
He's just out of surgery.

04:38.690 --> 04:40.269
We're waiting for him to regain consciousness.

04:40.270 --> 04:41.819
Do we have a time frame from the hospital

04:41.820 --> 04:43.440
On when that might happen?

04:43.930 --> 04:45.649
No, ma'am. Not really.

04:45.650 --> 04:46.829
Let me be clear,

04:46.830 --> 04:48.939
Recapturing almeida and bauer

04:48.940 --> 04:50.349
Isn't just your top priority,

04:50.350 --> 04:51.829
It's your only priority.

04:51.830 --> 04:53.039
Yes, ma'am.

04:53.040 --> 04:55.050
Keep us posted, agent.

04:56.090 --> 04:57.029
Bottom line

04:57.030 --> 04:58.699
The bureau is not going to be the answer

04:58.700 --> 05:01.230
To our prayers here. I'm afraid not.

05:01.470 --> 05:03.449
How much time does that leave us?

05:03.450 --> 05:05.040
Less than two hours.

05:05.550 --> 05:07.949
Dubaku's demand is that our forces retreat

05:07.950 --> 05:10.749
Behind the 23rd meridian within 24 hours.

05:10.750 --> 05:12.639
Now, in order to meet that timetable,

05:12.640 --> 05:14.309
The fleet and carrier air wing

05:14.310 --> 05:17.269
Must start withdrawing by 1:00, at the latest.

05:17.270 --> 05:19.919
Which would effectively end our mission in africa

05:19.920 --> 05:22.389
And condemn another 100,000 sangalans

05:22.390 --> 05:23.949
To a certain and brutal death.

05:23.950 --> 05:27.719
On the otherand, if you authorize the invasion,

05:27.720 --> 05:32.070
Dubaku will undoubtedly engage the cip device.

05:34.370 --> 05:37.790
How far has the faa gotten with grounding aircraft?

05:37.930 --> 05:39.749
Still over a thousand planes in the air

05:39.750 --> 05:41.709
Across the country waiting for clearance to land.

05:41.710 --> 05:43.179
Dubaku could bring down

05:43.180 --> 05:45.580
Any one of them at any moment.

05:45.700 --> 05:47.020
Or...

05:47.090 --> 05:50.620
Use the device for something far worse.

05:51.190 --> 05:53.329
I ran for office on the principle

05:53.330 --> 05:55.359
Of non-negotiation with terrorists.

05:55.360 --> 05:56.739
How can I abandon that now,

05:56.740 --> 05:58.769
The very first time I'm tested?

05:58.770 --> 06:01.109
And, if I do so, won't I be telling dubaku,

06:01.110 --> 06:02.519
And the rest of the world,

06:02.520 --> 06:04.579
That blackmailing america works?

06:04.580 --> 06:05.929
Madame president,

06:05.930 --> 06:08.059
Those are questions for the future.

06:08.060 --> 06:11.060
We have a decision to make now.

06:22.990 --> 06:24.660
What do you call this place?

06:24.660 --> 06:26.949
We like to think of it as ctu.

06:26.950 --> 06:28.850
What's left of it, anyway.

06:35.420 --> 06:36.710
Jack...

06:37.600 --> 06:38.749
Chloe.

06:38.750 --> 06:40.290
It's good to see you.

06:41.410 --> 06:43.270
It's good to see you, too.

06:43.510 --> 06:45.210
I'm glad you're with us.

06:45.380 --> 06:47.069
I'm not with anyone until someone starts

06:47.070 --> 06:48.759
Answering some questions.

06:48.760 --> 06:50.369
Might as well start wi you.

06:50.370 --> 06:52.460
Why the hell are you not dead?

06:53.020 --> 06:54.870
I was dead, jack.

06:55.100 --> 06:57.040
For almost ten minutes.

06:57.420 --> 06:58.859
Or so I was told.

06:58.860 --> 06:59.989
By who?

06:59.990 --> 07:01.400
By him.

07:04.800 --> 07:06.760
His name's david emerson.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.959
I don't know who he paid off at ctu,

07:08.960 --> 07:10.529
But it was his people who injected my body

07:10.530 --> 07:12.109
With a hypothermic compound,

07:12.110 --> 07:13.529
And was able to revive me.

07:13.530 --> 07:15.019
Who is he and what does he want?

07:15.020 --> 07:16.519
Independent contractor.

07:16.520 --> 07:18.759
Enlists ex-military and intelligence operatives,

07:18.760 --> 07:20.139
Jobs them out to clients.

07:20.140 --> 07:21.849
Apparently, I fit the profile.

07:21.850 --> 07:23.169
What profile?

07:23.170 --> 07:24.109
Former employees

07:24.110 --> 07:26.580
With grievances against the federal government.

07:27.340 --> 07:28.329
Emerson had been keeping

07:28.330 --> 07:31.149
Tabs on me ever since I left ctu.

07:31.150 --> 07:33.590
After michelle was killed...

07:34.060 --> 07:36.339
He figured I'd make a good recruit.

07:36.340 --> 07:38.379
And everyone else thinking you're dead,

07:38.380 --> 07:40.140
So much the better.

07:40.150 --> 07:42.159
Yeah. And since then, you've been

07:42.160 --> 07:44.490
Working undercover to expose his operation?

07:49.480 --> 07:50.980
No, jack.

07:51.360 --> 07:52.760
What?

07:53.670 --> 07:55.770
I was really working for him.

07:59.250 --> 08:00.850
I was angry.

08:01.020 --> 08:03.990
I hated the federal government for what it took from me.

08:06.490 --> 08:09.530
I ran emerson's crew for more than three years.

08:10.400 --> 08:12.650
And I did some pretty bad things.

08:19.690 --> 08:21.850
What made you turn against him?

08:21.980 --> 08:23.880
The cip device.

08:24.570 --> 08:26.189
Emerson had my crew

08:26.190 --> 08:29.110
Stealing components to breach the firewall.

08:29.220 --> 08:30.980
I knew what that meant

08:31.260 --> 08:33.188
Innocent americans would di

08:33.190 --> 08:35.149
And I didn't signed up for that. Damn it, tony!

08:35.150 --> 08:36.619
Why didn't you call the authorities?

08:36.620 --> 08:38.519
He couldn't, jack. Why not?

08:38.520 --> 08:41.360
He found out emerson's client was dubaku.

08:44.350 --> 08:46.519
That's who you believe has agents inside the government.

08:46.520 --> 08:50.099
The juma regime controls sangala's vast diamond wealth.

08:50.100 --> 08:52.129
Dubaku hasn't been shy about throwing it around.

08:52.130 --> 08:53.569
How widespread is the corruption?

08:53.570 --> 08:54.549
Pervasive.

08:54.550 --> 08:56.339
That's why tony came to me.

08:56.340 --> 08:58.689
He didn't know how far or high up this thing went.

08:58.690 --> 09:00.619
Dubaku is the key to this thing, jack.

09:00.620 --> 09:02.629
If we're going to uncover the conspiracy,

09:02.630 --> 09:04.979
We have to get to him before he leaves the u.S.

09:04.980 --> 09:08.119
That's why I have to get back under as soon as possible.

09:08.120 --> 09:09.669
There's a new job in the pipeline

09:09.670 --> 09:11.629
For me and my crew-- I don't have all the details,

09:11.630 --> 09:13.369
But I do know that it'll get me in the same room

09:13.370 --> 09:14.759
With dubkau himself.

09:14.760 --> 09:15.729
The challenge is going to be

09:15.730 --> 09:18.009
Reinstalling tony with emerson.

09:18.010 --> 09:18.809
We have to assume

09:18.810 --> 09:21.379
Emerson knew tony was in fbi custody and somehow

09:21.380 --> 09:23.079
Managed to escape. Emerson's going to think

09:23.080 --> 09:25.259
Tony made a deal with the u.S. Attorney.

09:25.260 --> 09:26.760
That's right.

09:36.200 --> 09:38.440
I can help you with this.

09:38.800 --> 09:40.490
Yes, you can.

09:42.480 --> 09:43.789
Outside of the three of you,

09:43.790 --> 09:45.700
Who else is involved in this operation?

09:46.440 --> 09:48.069
It's just us.

09:48.070 --> 09:49.590
This is it.

09:55.240 --> 09:56.199
Please, at least tell me

09:56.200 --> 09:58.999
That you've got some proof that this conspiracyxi es.

09:59.000 --> 09:59.929
Yes, we do.

09:59.930 --> 10:01.389
But only at the lowest level.

10:01.390 --> 10:04.350
At this point, we've just begun to scratch the surface.

10:11.830 --> 10:13.370
Okay.

10:15.050 --> 10:16.870
I'll work with you.

10:17.880 --> 10:19.049
But only because, right now,

10:19.050 --> 10:21.360
You are the only people that I trust.

10:22.430 --> 10:24.679
You give me one reason to question that,

10:24.680 --> 10:26.689
And I swear I will turn you in.

10:26.690 --> 10:28.250
You understand?

10:29.460 --> 10:30.279
All right.

10:30.280 --> 10:32.670
Chloe, set up the call with emerson.

10:33.900 --> 10:36.079
I found two freelancers who might work.

10:36.080 --> 10:36.999
Ex-rangers.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.459
You trust them? Yeah.

10:38.460 --> 10:40.289
I've worked with them before. They're close.

10:40.290 --> 10:41.869
Litvak knows them, too.

10:41.870 --> 10:43.279
Okay. They may want to know

10:43.280 --> 10:44.909
More about the job before they sign on.

10:44.910 --> 10:47.400
Only thing they need to know is what it pays.

10:48.180 --> 10:49.500
All right.

10:53.710 --> 10:55.120
It's me.

10:55.880 --> 10:57.260
Tony.

11:00.270 --> 11:01.199
Where are you?

11:01.200 --> 11:02.929
I'm at a parking garage, getting a car.

11:02.930 --> 11:04.509
I got away from the fbi.

11:04.510 --> 11:05.829
Yeah, I heard.

11:05.830 --> 11:08.589
I also heard it was jack bauer who broke you out.

11:08.590 --> 11:09.639
That's right.

11:09.640 --> 11:11.109
That doesn't make any sense, tony.

11:11.110 --> 11:13.529
Bauer's working for them. He helped capture you.

11:13.530 --> 11:15.199
It's only because he didn't have a choice.

11:15.200 --> 11:16.730
He's on board now.

11:17.100 --> 11:18.659
What do you mean "on board"?

11:18.660 --> 11:20.389
You heard about the senate hearings this morning?

11:20.390 --> 11:22.449
They're going to file criminal charges against him.

11:22.450 --> 11:24.689
I told bauer that if he helped us out with the msion,

11:24.690 --> 11:26.340
You could get him out of the country.

11:26.440 --> 11:28.349
Look, david, if it weren't for jack,

11:28.350 --> 11:29.789
I'd still be in custody.

11:29.790 --> 11:32.099
We can use him, I'm telling you.

11:32.100 --> 11:33.600
I don't know, tony.

11:33.720 --> 11:35.819
Morgan's hiring new men now.

11:35.820 --> 11:37.159
Morgan's a thug.

11:37.160 --> 11:38.939
He can't run point on something this important.

11:38.940 --> 11:40.399
Let me do it like we planned.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.920
Bauer can take tanner's place and we're good to go.

11:45.390 --> 11:46.619
All right, bring bauer.

11:46.620 --> 11:47.939
We're at 2211 chesterfield.

11:47.940 --> 11:49.249
Right off nolan.

11:49.250 --> 11:50.520
Got it.

11:51.250 --> 11:52.600
He buy it?

12:34.080 --> 12:36.009
Mr. Taylor, I understand you were looking for me.

12:36.010 --> 12:37.559
Yes, agent gedge, I have to go out

12:37.560 --> 12:38.809
And I'm going to need some transportation.

12:38.810 --> 12:40.579
Certainly. Where will we  going?

12:40.580 --> 12:42.290
I'll direct you on the way.

12:42.410 --> 12:44.609
I need a destination for the manifest, sir.

12:44.610 --> 12:47.979
As before, I'd like you to keep this off the manifest.

12:47.980 --> 12:50.850
And no driver this time, just you and me.

12:51.810 --> 12:53.909
I thought we were through with all the subterfuge, mr. Taylor.

12:53.910 --> 12:56.069
Please just do as I ask.

12:56.070 --> 12:58.990
I'm sorry, sir, not without xplanation.

13:03.190 --> 13:04.799
It's samantha roth.

13:04.800 --> 13:06.499
She says she has new information

13:06.500 --> 13:08.159
Regarding my son's death.

13:08.160 --> 13:08.959
Mr. Taylor...

13:08.960 --> 13:10.839
I thought I was done with this, too, believe me.

13:10.840 --> 13:11.819
I didn't initiate this.

13:11.820 --> 13:13.270
She called me.

13:14.910 --> 13:16.420
Brian...

13:17.390 --> 13:21.429
I know you felt obligated to report my prior activities--

13:21.430 --> 13:24.839
And rightly so-- but I would still like to think

13:24.840 --> 13:28.010
That I can count on your loyalty when I ask for it.

13:31.440 --> 13:33.050
I could lose my job, sir.

13:34.350 --> 13:38.349
This will be the last time. I promise.

13:38.350 --> 13:39.670
Henry?

13:40.850 --> 13:42.220
Please.

13:43.720 --> 13:45.449
I'll call you as soon as I secure a vehicle.

13:45.450 --> 13:46.920
Thank you.

13:50.150 --> 13:51.179
Who was that?

13:51.180 --> 13:52.749
Staff, nothing.

13:52.750 --> 13:54.579
Here, can you help me with this?

13:54.580 --> 13:55.930
Sure.

13:56.070 --> 13:57.399
It was a gift from my father.

13:57.400 --> 13:58.789
You remember? Mm-hmm.

13:58.790 --> 14:01.940
On the day I won back his seat in the senate.

14:02.720 --> 14:05.539
Prime minister matobo has asked to see me.

14:05.540 --> 14:06.289
He's going to want to know

14:06.290 --> 14:09.199
Why I haven't authorized the invasion yet.

14:09.200 --> 14:10.870
What are you going to tell him?

14:11.980 --> 14:13.600
I don't know.

14:15.120 --> 14:16.829
The american people elected you

14:16.830 --> 14:19.530
Because they trust your judgment, allison,

14:19.610 --> 14:20.499
And they're going to trust you

14:20.500 --> 14:22.570
To make the right call on this, too.

14:24.060 --> 14:26.640
I don't know what the right call is.

14:26.780 --> 14:31.250
The right call... Is whatever you decide it is.

14:34.160 --> 14:35.379
How many units in the field?

14:35.380 --> 14:38.239
17-- all available agents are deployed.

14:38.240 --> 14:39.509
Widen the grid-- we have to assume

14:39.510 --> 14:41.559
Bauer and almeida have gotten outside of our perimeter by now.

14:41.560 --> 14:42.900
On it.

14:45.350 --> 14:46.409
Sean hillinger.

14:46.410 --> 14:47.669
Sean, its me.

14:47.670 --> 14:48.569
Christina.

14:48.570 --> 14:51.390
Where are you? I'm calling from the plane.

14:51.660 --> 14:52.929
You haven't landed yet?

14:52.930 --> 14:56.129
No, th-the pilot says we're in a holding pattern...

14:56.130 --> 14:58.259
But we just keep circling and circling,

14:58.260 --> 15:00.409
And I can see other planes out the window, too--

15:00.410 --> 15:02.450
Eight or nine, at least.

15:02.850 --> 15:04.639
Christina, sweetheart, relax.

15:04.640 --> 15:06.779
But the woman sitting next to me says

15:06.780 --> 15:09.009
She heard something about a near miss

15:09.010 --> 15:11.800
And a problem with the air traffic control system.

15:12.490 --> 15:14.700
Sean, do you know anything about this?

15:15.250 --> 15:16.889
Yeah, it's true.

15:16.890 --> 15:19.249
The faa has grounded some planes, but it's only

15:19.250 --> 15:20.790
A precaution.

15:21.550 --> 15:22.669
Really?

15:22.670 --> 15:24.329
Yeah, it was an isolated incident.

15:24.330 --> 15:25.940
You're going to be fine.

15:26.840 --> 15:28.260
Okay.

15:28.440 --> 15:31.109
I just... I got worried there for a minute.

15:31.110 --> 15:32.389
You know how I am.

15:32.390 --> 15:33.439
I do.

15:33.440 --> 15:36.369
Now, listen, I want you to call me as soon as you land.

15:36.370 --> 15:37.730
I will.

15:38.110 --> 15:39.540
I love you.

15:39.750 --> 15:41.380
I love you, too.

15:44.870 --> 15:46.450
Was that your wife?

15:47.270 --> 15:49.670
Janis told me her plane's still in the air.

15:50.230 --> 15:51.680
You okay?

15:52.170 --> 15:54.759
Okay, there's a maniac out there with the capability

15:54.760 --> 15:57.929
Of bringing down planes at will, so, no, erika,

15:57.930 --> 16:00.079
I'm not okay. Her flight is number 18

16:00.080 --> 16:02.349
In the queue, so it'll be another two hours, at least,

16:02.350 --> 16:04.820
Before hers gets clearance.

16:05.130 --> 16:06.780
I'm sorry.

16:06.880 --> 16:08.680
Is there anything I can do?

16:08.880 --> 16:10.350
No.

16:11.170 --> 16:14.560
No, there's nothing anybody can do; that's the problem.

16:18.370 --> 16:19.969
Yeah, she's right here. I'll let her know.

16:19.970 --> 16:21.199
Thank you, bye-bye.

16:21.200 --> 16:22.460
Renee.

16:22.730 --> 16:24.779
I just got off the phone with the hospital.

16:24.780 --> 16:26.319
Tanner's regained consciousness.

16:26.320 --> 16:27.259
Is he well enough to talk?

16:27.260 --> 16:29.639
He's well enough to ask the doctor to make a phone call for him.

16:29.640 --> 16:30.579
Who did he call?

16:30.580 --> 16:33.299
Gage whitney pace, which is a law firm, I think.

16:33.300 --> 16:34.809
The second largest in dc.

16:34.810 --> 16:37.090
Go grab your laptop, janis. You're coming with me.

16:37.110 --> 16:38.509
I am?

16:38.510 --> 16:41.479
Why? Becauswee ave to get to tanner before his lawyers do

16:41.480 --> 16:43.429
And because if I can get almeida's location out of him,

16:43.430 --> 16:45.859
I want you on-site to vet the intelligence to our field teams.

16:45.860 --> 16:47.420
Go. Okay.

16:55.180 --> 16:56.790
Tell me about emerson.

16:57.340 --> 17:00.449
He's british, former sas.

17:00.450 --> 17:03.549
Urban warfare, sniping, close-quarter combat.

17:03.550 --> 17:06.148
Saw action in beirut and mogadishu.

17:06.150 --> 17:07.319
So he's good.

17:07.319 --> 17:08.829
Extremely.

17:08.829 --> 17:11.479
But he's not some wack job or ideologue.

17:11.480 --> 17:15.779
He's about two things-- money and personal loyalty.

17:15.780 --> 17:17.598
Sounds like you still admire him.

17:17.599 --> 17:18.729
Listen, jack,

17:18.730 --> 17:19.909
He treated me like a brother

17:19.910 --> 17:22.170
When I thought I had nobody else.

17:23.619 --> 17:25.550
Is this going to be a problem?

17:27.290 --> 17:28.810
No.

17:30.110 --> 17:32.290
I know he's on the wrong side of this.

17:32.430 --> 17:34.690
I'll do what has to be done.

17:52.600 --> 17:54.160
We're here.

18:08.570 --> 18:09.669
Where's emerson?

18:09.670 --> 18:10.739
Inside.

18:10.740 --> 18:12.150
Come in.

18:20.650 --> 18:21.869
David.

18:21.870 --> 18:23.320
Good to see you.

18:25.970 --> 18:29.240
Take mr. Bauer downstairs. I need to talk to tony.

18:38.590 --> 18:39.980
What's going on?

18:40.210 --> 18:42.970
Bringing in bauer is not worth the risk.

18:44.310 --> 18:45.900
What are you talking about?

18:52.000 --> 18:53.500
Have a seat.

18:54.530 --> 18:56.600
Emerson will be right with y

19:04.790 --> 19:07.189
I'd still be in fbi custody if it wasn't for him.

19:07.190 --> 19:08.599
Tony, you already made your case.

19:08.600 --> 19:10.160
We can use him.

19:10.350 --> 19:14.510
I considered it... But I'm going a different way.

19:16.390 --> 19:18.049
I owe him, david.

19:18.050 --> 19:18.989
You understand that?

19:18.990 --> 19:20.889
Yeah, and I appreciate your sense of loyalty.

19:20.890 --> 19:24.400
I always have, but this is business, tony.

19:24.520 --> 19:27.359
You can't have a... An unknown factor like jack bauer

19:27.360 --> 19:29.570
Coming in and messing things up.

19:32.830 --> 19:34.680
So, what, you're going to kill him?

19:39.320 --> 19:41.030
No, you are.

19:43.120 --> 19:44.740
They're going to kill him.

19:45.110 --> 19:46.369
He'll get out of it.

19:46.370 --> 19:48.679
Wh if he can't? Then jack's death

19:48.680 --> 19:52.019
Solidifies tony's position in the crew.

19:52.020 --> 19:53.969
Tony was in fbi custody.

19:53.970 --> 19:56.019
If he'd gone back in there by himself,

19:56.020 --> 19:58.239
The suspicion would have rested on him alone.

19:58.240 --> 20:00.549
So by deflecting it onto jack...

20:00.550 --> 20:02.600
We keep tony's cover viable.

20:03.800 --> 20:06.049
You knew this might happen the whole time.

20:06.050 --> 20:07.370
Yes.

20:10.100 --> 20:11.680
So did jack.

20:33.260 --> 20:34.970
Put your weapon down!

20:35.070 --> 20:37.650
Put your weapon down or I will kill him!

20:38.830 --> 20:42.200
I came here to do a job, not be double-crossed by you.

20:42.330 --> 20:43.549
You're already shorthanded.

20:43.550 --> 20:47.149
You need good men, not like these two traffic cops.

20:47.150 --> 20:49.080
Look what I've done to them.

20:50.720 --> 20:53.799
I am here because I've got nowhere else to go.

20:53.800 --> 20:54.889
Tony said if I helped you,

20:54.890 --> 20:57.040
You could get me out of the country.

20:59.020 --> 21:01.350
Look, if you don't believe me, pull the trigger.

21:11.040 --> 21:12.479
What, are you crazy?!

21:12.480 --> 21:13.839
Kill him!

21:13.840 --> 21:15.200
No.

21:19.650 --> 21:23.140
Kill him or I'm out of here.

21:27.820 --> 21:29.330
Fine.

21:54.370 --> 21:55.780
Keep it.

22:11.560 --> 22:14.179
Right, I need flight 112 reassigned

22:14.180 --> 22:15.329
For immediate landing.

22:15.330 --> 22:18.419
So you're requesting a priority landing for flight 112

22:18.420 --> 22:20.229
Out of las vegas? This is not a request.

22:20.230 --> 22:22.879
I'm forwarding an urgent protocol from the white house.

22:22.880 --> 22:24.520
And your name was...

22:25.820 --> 22:28.889
Larry moss, special agent in charge.

22:28.890 --> 22:30.879
This is a matter of national security.

22:30.880 --> 22:31.749
Agent moss,

22:31.750 --> 22:34.079
May I have your level five access number?

22:34.080 --> 22:37.549
6223-510.

22:37.550 --> 22:39.080
Thank you, sir.

22:39.270 --> 22:42.109
Flight 112 is moved to the head of the queue

22:42.110 --> 22:43.719
And should be on the ground shortly.

22:43.720 --> 22:45.240
Thank you.

22:46.800 --> 22:48.500
President taylor,

22:48.890 --> 22:51.359
This is colonel ike dubaku.

22:51.360 --> 22:53.659
As you have no doubt confirmed,

22:53.660 --> 22:58.230
The near-collision at jfk international was no accident.

22:58.240 --> 23:01.350
We have the cip device.

23:01.530 --> 23:04.109
We have the capability to kill

23:04.110 --> 23:07.140
Tens of thousands of americans

23:07.440 --> 23:10.390
And we are prepared to do so.

23:10.680 --> 23:13.309
I wanted you to hear it for yourself, prime minister,

23:13.310 --> 23:15.890
So that you would understand my dilemma.

23:16.650 --> 23:18.330
I see.

23:19.180 --> 23:22.039
Yoare recalling the invasion force.

23:22.040 --> 23:24.489
Well, that determination has yet to be made.

23:24.490 --> 23:27.829
And this device over which dubaku has control,

23:27.830 --> 23:29.659
It poses a significant risk

23:29.660 --> 23:31.380
To your people? Yes.

23:31.410 --> 23:33.929
It's a technology that has the potential

23:33.930 --> 23:36.409
For mass civilian casualties.

23:36.410 --> 23:39.559
And it puts thinfrastructure of my country in grave jeopardy.

23:39.560 --> 23:40.809
What of sangala?

23:40.810 --> 23:44.559
Believe me, no one is more aware of what's at stake than i.

23:44.560 --> 23:46.659
So you've been informed of the situation

23:46.660 --> 23:48.550
In kasanga province?

23:49.200 --> 23:52.679
Juma's troops are advancing on a refugee camp.

23:52.680 --> 23:54.939
Over 2,000 lives are threatened.

23:54.940 --> 23:56.979
Mostly women and children.

23:56.980 --> 23:59.849
There is also the matter of those soldiers who have,

23:59.850 --> 24:01.959
On the promise of american support,

24:01.960 --> 24:03.399
Deserted the regime and joined

24:03.400 --> 24:05.690
My freedom fighters on the ground.

24:06.130 --> 24:07.449
At least...

24:07.450 --> 24:09.509
Provide us the weapons we need in order

24:09.510 --> 24:11.350
To efend ourselves.

24:11.640 --> 24:14.549
You've been patient with us before, mr. Matobo.

24:14.550 --> 24:17.990
I can only ask that you be patient again.

24:18.890 --> 24:21.700
Now, please, if you'll excuse me.

24:23.460 --> 24:25.679
Madame president, I implore you,

24:25.680 --> 24:27.639
Do not abandon my country.

24:27.640 --> 24:31.390
Mr. Matobo, I ll do everything that I can.

24:32.620 --> 24:34.700
I count on you.

24:35.850 --> 24:37.430
Thank you.

24:49.460 --> 24:50.749
You didn't think that I would want

24:50.750 --> 24:53.039
To know about the refugees in kasanga?

24:53.040 --> 24:55.249
Mame president, you have enough to think about

24:55.250 --> 24:57.149
Without being burdened with details.

24:57.150 --> 24:59.469
Especially details that might push me toward

24:59.470 --> 25:01.179
Proceeding with the invasion.

25:01.180 --> 25:03.379
Ma'am, you have to start

25:03.380 --> 25:06.709
Focusing on alternatives to the invasion.

25:06.710 --> 25:08.629
Give me a good alternative

25:08.630 --> 25:11.449
And I'll consider it. I'm not saying it's a good alternative,

25:11.450 --> 25:13.270
But it's the only one.

25:13.700 --> 25:16.030
Comply with dubaku's demands.

25:16.300 --> 25:18.890
Stand down the task force.

25:19.200 --> 25:21.510
That's your recommendation?

25:21.540 --> 25:22.629
Back down?

25:22.630 --> 25:24.019
It is.

25:24.020 --> 25:25.819
Damn it, ethan, you heard matobo.

25:25.820 --> 25:29.469
He's has fighters on the ground counting on us.

25:29.470 --> 25:32.489
Do you want me to be responsible for another bay of pigs?

25:32.490 --> 25:34.259
Kennedy survived the bay of pigs,

25:34.260 --> 25:36.230
And you'll survive this.

25:37.360 --> 25:41.229
A superpower has to act first and foremost in its own

25:41.230 --> 25:43.119
Best interests.

25:43.120 --> 25:44.769
Always? Always.

25:44.770 --> 25:46.319
No apologies.

25:46.320 --> 25:48.329
What about allowing a third party

25:48.330 --> 25:51.299
To dictate its foreign policy-- does a superpower do that?

25:51.300 --> 25:53.939
Yes, if there's no other option.

25:53.940 --> 25:56.590
And right now, there's not.

25:59.630 --> 26:01.499
What have we heard from the fbi about the search

26:01.500 --> 26:03.130
For almeida and bauer?

26:03.420 --> 26:04.900
Nothing, ma'am.

26:04.900 --> 26:06.770
Check with them anyway.

26:12.820 --> 26:14.620
No hard feelings, jack?

26:16.850 --> 26:18.380
Forget it.

26:19.320 --> 26:21.189
Have to be careful in our profession.

26:21.190 --> 26:22.870
I'm sure you understand.

26:23.480 --> 26:26.009
Yeah. We all know the drill.

26:26.010 --> 26:27.329
Disagreements are fine,

26:27.330 --> 26:29.970
But when a decision's made,

26:30.120 --> 26:32.539
Fall in or you're gone.

26:32.540 --> 26:34.680
I've heard a lot of guys say that.

26:35.180 --> 26:37.010
Good to know you mean it.

26:41.780 --> 26:43.309
Before you were subpoenaed,

26:43.310 --> 26:46.629
You traveled the world, place to place, than a year.

26:46.630 --> 26:48.030
Why?

26:50.780 --> 26:52.380
What were you looking for?

26:52.430 --> 26:54.009
It doesn't really matter.

26:54.010 --> 26:56.069
Whatever it was, I didn't find it.

26:56.070 --> 26:57.969
You must have known what was waiting.

26:57.970 --> 26:59.389
Why'd you come back?

26:59.390 --> 27:02.089
Wanted to know what it was like to walk into a propeller.

27:02.090 --> 27:03.630
That's funny.

27:04.520 --> 27:06.170
But no, really.

27:09.300 --> 27:10.890
Why?

27:13.300 --> 27:15.160
This is my home.

27:16.450 --> 27:18.729
That doesn't explain why you turned yourself in

27:18.730 --> 27:20.510
To the justice department.

27:21.930 --> 27:24.820
Tony said you were in beirut and mogadishu.

27:25.900 --> 27:27.499
And afghanistan.

27:27.500 --> 27:28.859
Two tours.

27:28.860 --> 27:31.989
Went back a third time as a private contractor.

27:31.990 --> 27:34.040
Be polite, professional,

27:34.240 --> 27:37.240
And have a plan to kill everyone you meet, right?

27:37.350 --> 27:38.790
Pretty much.

27:39.270 --> 27:41.140
That's the question, isn't it?

27:41.370 --> 27:44.749
Where do the rules of engagement end and the crimes begin?

27:44.750 --> 27:47.009
You want to know why I came back?

27:47.010 --> 27:48.750
That's why.

27:49.060 --> 27:50.740
I'm not sure I follow.

27:51.020 --> 27:53.300
I just got tired of talking to myself.

27:53.460 --> 27:56.109
You see, I actually believe everything I did was right.

27:56.110 --> 27:58.590
So I wanted to start a dialogue.

27:58.640 --> 28:01.390
Come clean, set the record straight.

28:02.190 --> 28:03.469
First mistake.

28:03.470 --> 28:05.080
So I found out.

28:05.490 --> 28:09.039
No one who hasn't been to the edge and looked over

28:09.040 --> 28:10.840
Can ever understand.

28:14.380 --> 28:16.440
It's good to have you on board, jack.

28:31.510 --> 28:32.939
What was that about?

28:32.940 --> 28:34.949
He's just trying to get a handle on me.

28:34.950 --> 28:37.100
Watch yourself around him, jack.

28:37.390 --> 28:39.740
And do not underestimate him.

28:40.100 --> 28:41.860
I won't.

28:47.090 --> 28:48.619
All right, listen up.

28:48.620 --> 28:49.659
I just got the call.

28:49.660 --> 28:51.579
We're a go. A go for what?

28:51.580 --> 28:53.760
We don't even know what the hell the job is.

28:53.770 --> 28:56.509
Picking up a package, delivering it to our client.

28:56.510 --> 28:58.049
Here's the location.

28:58.050 --> 29:01.249
A residence at 167 foxhall road.

29:01.250 --> 29:02.709
It belongs to the state department.

29:02.710 --> 29:03.909
Memorize the layout. We don't know

29:03.910 --> 29:05.339
The exact spot of the pickup yet,

29:05.340 --> 29:07.180
But probably the master suite.

29:07.250 --> 29:08.909
The package is a person.

29:08.910 --> 29:10.550
Yeah, it is.

29:13.160 --> 29:16.410
Former prime minister matobo of sangala.

29:16.500 --> 29:17.929
The assignment is to grab him

29:17.930 --> 29:19.779
And deliver him to colonel dubaku.

29:19.780 --> 29:21.349
The colonel wants to ask him some questions,

29:21.350 --> 29:22.569
And as you can imagine,

29:22.570 --> 29:24.829
The colonel can be quite persuasive.

29:24.830 --> 29:26.909
Now, matobo has tight security,

29:26.910 --> 29:29.609
So finish arming up, be prepared to engage.

29:29.610 --> 29:31.449
We roll in two minutes.

29:31.450 --> 29:32.949
They're going to kidnap matobo.

29:32.950 --> 29:34.549
We have to alert somebody and stop this.

29:34.550 --> 29:35.989
No, weo nothing.

29:35.990 --> 29:36.989
But you heard them-- they're going

29:36.990 --> 29:38.409
To torture him and probably kill him.

29:38.410 --> 29:40.360
Unfortunately, yes.

29:41.210 --> 29:43.189
Matobo single-handedly led the fight

29:43.190 --> 29:45.019
Against genocide in his country.

29:45.020 --> 29:47.379
He doesn't deserve this. I understand that, chloe.

29:47.380 --> 29:48.909
But if we don't go along with the grab,

29:48.910 --> 29:51.009
Jack and tony will not find colonel dubaku,

29:51.010 --> 29:54.030
And we will not get to the bottom of this conspiracy.

29:54.750 --> 29:56.160
Agreed?

29:58.840 --> 30:00.180
Agreed

30:28.360 --> 30:30.929
I don't want you to wait for me. Sir?

30:30.930 --> 30:31.809
Just drive away.

30:31.810 --> 30:33.459
I'll call when I need you.

30:33.460 --> 30:35.419
You know I can't do that, mr. Taylor.

30:35.420 --> 30:36.969
We're already off the manifest, brian.

30:36.970 --> 30:38.930
She won't talk to me unless I'm alone.

30:41.800 --> 30:44.309
All right, I'll take up a position on the bridge.

30:44.310 --> 30:45.990
She'll never know I'm there.

30:48.100 --> 30:49.740
All right.

31:23.650 --> 31:25.219
Mr. Taylor. Sam.

31:25.220 --> 31:26.780
I can't stay long.

31:26.810 --> 31:28.700
What you told me on the phone,

31:29.420 --> 31:30.739
Is it true?

31:30.740 --> 31:33.779
Yes, they killed roger and made it look like a suicide.

31:33.780 --> 31:34.969
Who? Who did this?

31:34.970 --> 31:36.449
The same people who provided

31:36.450 --> 31:38.219
False documents to the sec to show

31:38.220 --> 31:39.749
He'd been trading on inside information.

31:39.750 --> 31:41.409
Who are they? I don't know who they are.

31:41.410 --> 31:43.549
They just said that they would kill me if I said anything.

31:43.550 --> 31:45.750
Easy, easy, sam. Easy.

31:48.360 --> 31:49.920
I loved him.

31:49.920 --> 31:51.599
I know you did, sam.

31:51.600 --> 31:54.160
But right now, I really need to know what happened.

31:55.320 --> 31:58.289
Roger was tasked with auditing the brokers in his department.

31:58.290 --> 31:59.299
That's how it started.

31:59.300 --> 32:00.759
When was this? Jaary.

32:00.760 --> 32:02.509
Uh, early january.

32:02.510 --> 32:05.149
The compliance officer at his firm asked him to flag

32:05.150 --> 32:08.049
Any undisclosed ownership in securities positions.

32:08.050 --> 32:09.009
I don't understand.

32:09.010 --> 32:10.299
Basically, kickbacks.

32:10.300 --> 32:12.009
But what he found was something else.

32:12.010 --> 32:15.119
Two of his portfolio managers had taken on a new client.

32:15.120 --> 32:16.189
The bahamas branch

32:16.190 --> 32:19.139
Bank lausanne international.

32:19.140 --> 32:20.439
What was wrong with that?

32:20.440 --> 32:21.689
Bank lausanne's records revealed that

32:21.690 --> 32:23.109
It was actively trading with firms

32:23.110 --> 32:24.689
Doing business in sangala.

32:24.690 --> 32:26.979
Sangala?! It jumped out at roger, too,

32:26.980 --> 32:29.859
For obvious reasons, and digging deeper,

32:29.860 --> 32:31.629
He uncovered other blind accounts

32:31.630 --> 32:33.339
That were copying the bank's trades.

32:33.340 --> 32:34.670
Which account

32:35.430 --> 32:37.149
Accounts that were traced to a senior memberh accounts?

32:37.150 --> 32:39.060
Of your wife's administration.

32:40.330 --> 32:41.770
Who?

32:41.990 --> 32:43.449
I don't know.

32:43.450 --> 32:45.749
But whoever it was had a vested interest in the proposed

32:45.750 --> 32:47.329
Military action.

32:47.330 --> 32:49.359
Somebody who was betting against her,

32:49.360 --> 32:51.469
Who didn't think she'd be able to pull it off politically?

32:51.470 --> 32:54.670
Betting heavily in 10,000-share blocks.

32:55.550 --> 32:57.029
Roger was a day or two away

32:57.030 --> 32:58.920
From presenting her with the evidence.

33:00.920 --> 33:02.610
It's all here.

33:03.260 --> 33:04.760
Account numbers,

33:04.900 --> 33:07.480
Trading records, everything that he knew.

33:08.760 --> 33:10.929
I'm sorry that I can't help you out more.

33:10.930 --> 33:13.479
Samantha... I've given you all I can.

33:13.480 --> 33:16.000
Do what you have to do, but leave me out of it.

33:16.390 --> 33:17.870
Please?

33:18.360 --> 33:19.870
Okay.

33:20.600 --> 33:22.110
Thank you.

33:46.120 --> 33:46.979
Is tanner in there?

33:46.980 --> 33:49.759
Yes. His condition is still listed as critical.

33:49.760 --> 33:50.839
Are his lawyers here yet?

33:50.840 --> 33:53.559
No. But they will be any minute.

33:53.560 --> 33:55.409
Okay, get down to the lobby and keep an eye out for them.

33:55.410 --> 33:57.279
Call me as soon as they enter the hospital.

33:57.280 --> 33:58.580
Got it.

34:09.880 --> 34:11.259
Hello, mr. Tanner.

34:11.260 --> 34:12.109
I'm agent walker.

34:12.110 --> 34:14.379
This is agent gold. We're with the fbi.

34:14.380 --> 34:16.100
I think you remember me.

34:16.790 --> 34:19.589
I know you're in pain, so I'll ma tkes brief.

34:19.590 --> 34:22.020
Tell me where tony almeida is.

34:24.440 --> 34:27.009
Does almeida have another base of operations?

34:27.010 --> 34:29.300
Is that where the cip device is?

34:30.090 --> 34:31.228
My lawyers...

34:31.230 --> 34:33.688
Cannot help you, mr. Tanner.

34:33.690 --> 34:35.609
You're going to spend the rest of your life in pson

34:35.610 --> 34:37.590
If you don't cooperate.

34:37.770 --> 34:39.609
But if you do, I give you my word,

34:39.610 --> 34:41.679
I will personally vouch for you.

34:41.760 --> 34:43.688
Helping me find the device can go a long way

34:43.690 --> 34:45.980
Towards reducing your sentence.

34:46.980 --> 34:49.139
I'm sorry. Is something funny?

34:50.920 --> 34:53.009
They'd never let that happen.

34:53.010 --> 34:54.679
Who is they? Colonel dubaku?

34:54.679 --> 34:56.458
Is that who tony almeida takes his orders from?

34:56.460 --> 34:58.090
Do you work for him too?

35:01.500 --> 35:03.330
Go away.

35:03.820 --> 35:05.960
Open your eyes, mr. Tanner.

35:06.520 --> 35:08.590
I said open your eyes.

35:09.050 --> 35:11.699
Look at me! Is dubaku here in this country?

35:11.700 --> 35:12.909
Does he have the device?

35:12.910 --> 35:14.849
Renee... Renee, renee...

35:14.850 --> 35:16.850
Please. Renee...

35:19.830 --> 35:21.149
I don't know what you're doing.

35:21.150 --> 35:22.580
What are you doing?

35:23.400 --> 35:24.159
Walker.

35:24.160 --> 35:26.089
Tanner's lawyers just arrived.

35:26.090 --> 35:27.620
All right, thanks.

35:33.730 --> 35:34.929
His legal team is here.

35:34.930 --> 35:36.109
I need you to stall them.

35:36.110 --> 35:38.999
Me? How am I supposed to do that? I don't care. Make something up.

35:39.000 --> 35:40.739
Just keep them out of this room as long as you can.

35:40.740 --> 35:41.989
I'm not comfortable with this.

35:41.990 --> 35:43.019
Comfortable with what?

35:43.020 --> 35:45.229
We are breaking about 50 federal guidelines

35:45.230 --> 35:47.009
Just by being here. Listen to me, janis.

35:47.010 --> 35:48.859
This man is our only lead.

35:48.860 --> 35:50.879
That man asked for legal counsel.

35:50.880 --> 35:52.369
I heard him.

35:52.370 --> 35:55.139
Thousands of lives are at stake here.

35:55.140 --> 35:56.999
We either bend the rules a little bit right now

35:57.000 --> 35:58.369
Or we lose this chance forever.

35:58.370 --> 36:00.619
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I just... I can't.

36:00.620 --> 36:02.839
Look, tony almeida and jack bauer

36:02.840 --> 36:04.279
Escaped custody on my watch.

36:04.280 --> 36:06.100
I have to make this right.

36:08.110 --> 36:10.060
You either help me or you don't.

36:14.890 --> 36:16.490
Okay.

36:39.430 --> 36:41.040
Execuse me, gentleman

36:42.970 --> 36:44.179
You're out of time, mr. Tanner.

36:44.180 --> 36:45.540
Tell me what you know.

36:47.120 --> 36:49.159
You can do what you want to me.

36:49.160 --> 36:52.030
I'm not going to tell you a damn thing.

36:56.690 --> 36:58.450
Who do you work for?!

37:01.180 --> 37:03.030
You can't do this...

37:03.450 --> 37:05.219
Where is almeida?

37:05.220 --> 37:08.350
How do I find the cip device? Tell me now.

37:10.120 --> 37:12.010
My lawyers...

37:36.560 --> 37:38.190
You can't do this.

37:38.720 --> 37:40.420
You're fbi.

37:41.410 --> 37:43.130
This is illegal.

37:44.650 --> 37:46.580
I have rights.

37:47.610 --> 37:50.840
I suggest you use your last breath wisely.

37:55.180 --> 37:57.010
Go to hell.

38:17.730 --> 38:20.079
I assure you, I'm taking this very seriously.

38:20.080 --> 38:21.489
Then tell us where our client is.

38:21.490 --> 38:23.159
As I said, he was moved for security reasons.

38:23.160 --> 38:24.879
Into the annex? Yes, s.Ir

38:24.880 --> 38:25.909
Then why isn't he there?

38:25.910 --> 38:27.569
Listen, if I can just get on the phone,

38:27.570 --> 38:28.389
I'll call my office.

38:28.390 --> 38:29.329
We'll get to the bottom of this...

38:29.330 --> 38:31.449
We've had enough of your help, agent gold.

38:31.450 --> 38:34.169
I... I'm genuinely confused too.

38:34.170 --> 38:35.549
Excuse me. Uh-huh.

38:35.550 --> 38:38.399
We're trying to find our client, mr. Alan tanner.

38:38.400 --> 38:40.020
Just a minute

38:42.190 --> 38:44.460
I've got a ventilator malfunction.

38:45.180 --> 38:47.010
Damn it! He's coding!

38:47.080 --> 38:49.439
Get a team and a crash cart over here, stat!

38:49.440 --> 38:51.110
Room 421, tanner.

38:53.930 --> 38:55.719
It's blocked or something.

38:55.720 --> 38:57.859
We have to get in there! I'm trying to!

38:57.860 --> 38:59.999
It won't push. Hello?! Open this door!

39:00.000 --> 39:01.809
This is an emergency!

39:01.810 --> 39:03.819
I can't get the door open. It's jammed!

39:03.820 --> 39:05.950
Is somebody in there with him?

39:09.310 --> 39:10.479
He's all yours, counselor.

39:10.480 --> 39:11.359
Wait a minute.

39:11.360 --> 39:12.589
We need to talk to you!

39:12.590 --> 39:14.439
Renee... You don't want to know, janis.

39:14.440 --> 39:15.589
Don't ask.

39:15.590 --> 39:17.960
Have agent alves drive you back to the office.

39:22.840 --> 39:23.629
Hillinger.

39:23.630 --> 39:24.989
Let me speak to larry.

39:24.990 --> 39:27.510
Sir, I've got walker on the line.

39:31.000 --> 39:31.909
Did you get anything?

39:31.910 --> 39:33.219
I may have a lead on almeida.

39:33.220 --> 39:34.279
Apparently, there's a plot in place

39:34.280 --> 39:37.069
Against the former prime minister sangala. Matobo?

39:37.070 --> 39:39.509
Tanner says almeida's crew has a plan to abduct him.

39:39.510 --> 39:40.169
When

39:40.170 --> 39:41.249
Pretty much now.

39:41.250 --> 39:42.959
Listen, larry, if almeida's still a part of this

39:42.960 --> 39:44.909
And we can get there before him, we can set a trap.

39:44.910 --> 39:47.449
All right. I'll alert the prime minister's

39:47.450 --> 39:49.629
Security detail and scramble a tac team.

39:49.630 --> 39:50.379
Matobo's housed

39:50.380 --> 39:51.949
Is in the state department residence

39:51.950 --> 39:54.519
167 foxhall road.

39:54.520 --> 39:55.339
I'm on my way.

39:55.340 --> 39:57.649
Renee, do not go in alone. Wait for backup.

39:57.650 --> 39:58.910
Right.

40:10.960 --> 40:11.699
Yes.

40:11.700 --> 40:13.029
Is this major etolo?

40:13.030 --> 40:13.789
It is.

40:13.790 --> 40:15.609
This is special agent larry moss, fbi.

40:15.610 --> 40:16.549
This is not a drill.

40:16.550 --> 40:19.619
Alpha alpha delta. Lock the prime minister down.

40:19.620 --> 40:21.399
I repeat, lock him down.

40:21.400 --> 40:22.309
Yes, sir.

40:51.280 --> 40:53.030
We're clear. Go.

41:01.270 --> 41:02.449
Where's matobo?!

41:02.450 --> 41:03.469
I don't know...

41:03.470 --> 41:06.250
Where is he?! Where is he?!

41:06.370 --> 41:07.720
I got him!

41:23.120 --> 41:24.889
Drop the weapon! Now!

41:24.890 --> 41:26.319
Put the gun down!

41:26.320 --> 41:27.800
On your knees!

41:29.620 --> 41:31.639
Where is matobo?

41:31.640 --> 41:33.570
You will not be able to get to him n

42:14.400 --> 42:16.089
What is happening, ule?

42:16.090 --> 42:18.200
Who is doing this to us?

42:18.280 --> 42:19.719
Stay calm.

42:19.720 --> 42:21.650
It's going to be all right.

42:27.830 --> 42:29.320
It's dead.

42:32.240 --> 42:33.049
What you got?

42:33.050 --> 42:35.650
It's a safe room; reinforced concrete.

42:36.280 --> 42:38.450
Why the hell didn't we know about this?

42:41.750 --> 42:43.959
You have three seconds to open the door.

42:43.960 --> 42:45.620
One... I can't.

42:46.110 --> 42:46.909
Two...

42:46.910 --> 42:48.689
It can't be unlocked from the outside.

42:48.690 --> 42:50.700
It can only be opened from the inside.

42:59.370 --> 43:01.029
Jack, if we leave here without matobo,

43:01.030 --> 43:03.760
We lose our only chance of getting at dubaku.
