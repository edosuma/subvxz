00:00.807 --> 00:02.382
<i>- Previously on</i> Bull...
- When we hear

00:02.407 --> 00:04.474
that one of our federal
employees and his family

00:04.476 --> 00:07.134
have been a victim
of arson, rape and murder,

00:07.159 --> 00:08.792
<i>we like to stick our nose in.</i>

00:08.794 --> 00:10.393
You, silver Explorer.

00:10.395 --> 00:12.996
<i>They haven't mentioned
it in the news reports,</i>

00:12.998 --> 00:14.230
<i>but Elliott is mute.</i>

00:14.232 --> 00:16.733
The government wants to execute you,

00:16.735 --> 00:19.169
and I would like to make sure
that doesn't happen.

00:19.171 --> 00:21.971
I think that you're in the
middle of some kind of crisis.

00:22.693 --> 00:24.498
Getting arrested, drinking too much,

00:24.523 --> 00:26.585
taking a death penalty case

00:26.610 --> 00:28.200
<i>'cause a guy gave you a handkerchief.</i>

00:28.202 --> 00:30.478
I haven't had a drink in 33 hours.

00:30.480 --> 00:32.171
<i>Seems like you're coming apart.</i>

00:32.171 --> 00:33.438
I'm fine.

00:33.440 --> 00:34.506
You know what? You're not.

00:34.508 --> 00:36.308
<i>Izzy's getting remarried.</i>

00:36.310 --> 00:37.576
Oh, my goodness.

00:37.578 --> 00:39.442
Can I tell you something?

00:39.444 --> 00:41.880
I don't think you're good alone, Jason.

00:41.882 --> 00:44.783
Professor Jameson, you failed me.

00:44.785 --> 00:47.519
Is it just that I work
for a trial scientist?

00:47.521 --> 00:48.754
I know he's innocent.

00:48.756 --> 00:49.654
No, you don't.

00:49.656 --> 00:51.022
- Did you do it?
<i>- You, you,</i>

00:51.024 --> 00:52.290
<i>you think he's innocent.</i>

00:52.292 --> 00:53.959
That's not the same thing,

00:53.961 --> 00:56.094
and more importantly, you don't know

00:56.096 --> 00:57.295
how to prove he's innocent.

00:57.297 --> 00:58.997
<i>Sorry to let everybody down.</i>

00:59.898 --> 01:02.534
But I think I need a drink.

02:27.588 --> 02:29.487
and at 'em so they can hear the verdict

02:29.489 --> 02:31.723
read this morning.

02:31.725 --> 02:35.760
Thank you.

02:35.762 --> 02:38.230
I, uh, I have no recollection
of calling you

02:38.232 --> 02:40.966
and asking you to bring me a new suit.

02:40.968 --> 02:43.568
It was at 3:17 this morning.

02:43.570 --> 02:45.804
I remember it vividly.

02:45.806 --> 02:46.905
Aha.

02:46.907 --> 02:48.777
Here's the thing,

02:49.409 --> 02:51.343
I know I've let you down.

02:51.345 --> 02:52.978
Some of the things,

02:52.980 --> 02:54.779
the behavioral things we discussed,

02:54.781 --> 02:57.214
things I did...

02:57.216 --> 03:00.914
I actually did get a handle on
them there for a couple of days.

03:03.834 --> 03:05.390
I'm sorry, Marissa.

03:05.392 --> 03:06.953
Will the defendant

03:06.978 --> 03:08.000
<i>please rise?</i>

03:12.199 --> 03:14.132
Has the jury reached a verdict?

03:14.134 --> 03:15.721
We have, Your Honor.

03:16.370 --> 03:18.103
We, the jury, find the defendant,

03:18.105 --> 03:19.704
Elliot Miles...

03:21.208 --> 03:24.271
guilty on two counts of capital murder.

I'm so sorry.

03:47.067 --> 03:49.467
I'm sorry.

03:53.677 --> 03:56.283
_

03:56.510 --> 04:00.512
When I was in college,
I had to take Psych 100.

04:00.514 --> 04:03.448
And one day the professor
started to teach us

04:03.450 --> 04:05.354
about codependency.

04:05.919 --> 04:09.054
And I was just amazed.

04:09.056 --> 04:11.089
I mean, I was adopted.

04:11.091 --> 04:13.091
And frankly, I had never depended

04:13.093 --> 04:16.461
on anybody for anything
in my whole life, so...

04:16.463 --> 04:19.868
the idea that I could be
codependent sounded...

04:20.399 --> 04:21.786
fabulous.

04:22.402 --> 04:25.637
That someone could derive their happiness

04:25.639 --> 04:27.751
by being consumed with mine...

04:28.669 --> 04:30.796
that sounded like nirvana.

04:34.132 --> 04:35.180
It never occurred to me

04:35.182 --> 04:37.048
that I would be the one being consumed

04:37.050 --> 04:39.137
with someone else's happiness.

04:46.526 --> 04:48.093
Where the hell is everybody?

04:48.095 --> 04:49.427
It's a Tuesday.

04:50.831 --> 04:53.531
I gave everybody a couple days off.

04:53.533 --> 04:56.441
I couldn't stand the way
they were looking at me.

04:56.443 --> 04:58.436
Sounds like a fun place to work.

04:59.449 --> 05:01.006
FBI got a package in the mail.

05:01.008 --> 05:03.308
Potentially exculpatory evidence.

05:03.310 --> 05:04.976
I thought I'd share it
with you personally.

05:04.978 --> 05:08.279
Matt Johnson's class ring.

05:08.281 --> 05:10.248
Engraved with his initials
and everything.

05:10.250 --> 05:12.784
Must have come from the crime scene.

05:12.786 --> 05:14.953
Came with a gift card.

05:14.955 --> 05:16.788
"You got the wrong guy."

05:20.627 --> 05:22.627
Well, maybe you did...

05:22.629 --> 05:24.496
get the wrong guy, I mean.

05:24.498 --> 05:25.663
Let's not get carried away here.

05:25.665 --> 05:26.931
Elliot could have sent it himself.

05:26.933 --> 05:29.100
- From jail?
- He could have had anybody do it,

05:29.102 --> 05:31.136
knowing it would disrupt the case.

05:31.138 --> 05:33.338
A last-ditch effort to save his own life.

05:33.340 --> 05:35.006
Or here's a crazy thought:

05:35.008 --> 05:37.108
the person who sent this to you knows

05:37.110 --> 05:38.910
who the real killer is,
and doesn't want to see

05:38.912 --> 05:41.646
an innocent man die
for something he didn't do.

05:42.816 --> 05:45.350
Actually, I'd like
to talk with your client,

05:45.352 --> 05:47.819
maybe even discuss a possible deal.

05:49.790 --> 05:52.123
Frankly, we believe this ring
came from someone tied to you.

05:52.125 --> 05:54.259
An accomplice, and I'm very interested

05:54.261 --> 05:55.988
in seeing that person brought to justice,

05:55.990 --> 05:58.229
which is why I'm prepared
to offer you a deal.

05:58.231 --> 06:00.799
You give me that person's name,
and I will once again

06:00.801 --> 06:03.535
offer to take the death penalty
off the table.

06:03.537 --> 06:06.337
Guarantee you life in prison.

06:22.456 --> 06:24.456
"There is no name.

06:24.458 --> 06:26.524
I didn't kill those people."

06:28.455 --> 06:30.161
Do you want the deal, Elliot?

06:30.163 --> 06:31.296
How can he take the deal?!

06:31.298 --> 06:33.131
He doesn't have a name to offer.

06:37.404 --> 06:39.549
Who keeps a ring like that?

06:40.907 --> 06:42.373
A piece of evidence,

06:42.375 --> 06:44.275
leads directly back to the victim.

06:44.277 --> 06:47.145
Has his name inscribed
on it, for God's sakes.

06:47.147 --> 06:48.646
It's reckless...

06:48.648 --> 06:50.715
the kind of thing that gets you caught.

06:50.717 --> 06:52.479
I don't know.

06:55.565 --> 06:57.484
What if it was a souvenir?

07:00.393 --> 07:01.793
What do you mean?

07:01.795 --> 07:04.729
What if it was all...

07:04.731 --> 07:07.494
planned from the start?

07:08.135 --> 07:10.902
You rape, you kill,

07:10.904 --> 07:12.837
you set a fire...

07:12.839 --> 07:14.876
you take some trophies.

07:16.670 --> 07:18.576
What if we should be looking for

07:18.578 --> 07:21.146
a methodical, premeditating,

07:21.148 --> 07:24.149
calculating killer?

07:24.678 --> 07:26.555
A serial killer?

07:28.622 --> 07:31.990
What if he knew exactly

07:31.992 --> 07:34.025
how to set the fire.

07:34.027 --> 07:38.062
Exactly how to restrain the victims.

07:38.064 --> 07:42.028
And the ring showing up now?

07:42.769 --> 07:45.003
What if that's not an accident.

07:45.005 --> 07:46.704
What if none of this ever was.

07:46.706 --> 07:49.541
And whoever it was took it as a memento,

07:49.543 --> 07:51.042
a kind of keepsake.

07:51.044 --> 07:52.610
Exactly.

07:52.612 --> 07:54.879
A trophy from one of his kills.

07:54.881 --> 07:56.614
And that is why he was wearing it

07:56.616 --> 07:58.416
the night he sold Elliot the car,

07:59.129 --> 08:00.393
flaunting it.

08:00.395 --> 08:02.253
You think this was part of a pattern.

08:02.255 --> 08:03.721
You think this person killed before.

08:03.723 --> 08:06.457
I do, and will almost surely kill again.

08:06.459 --> 08:08.826
There's just one thing
that doesn't add up.

08:08.828 --> 08:11.129
Why steal the car?

08:11.131 --> 08:12.597
It's a sloppy move.

08:12.599 --> 08:14.132
And it doesn't fit the methodical,

08:14.134 --> 08:16.568
meticulous psychopath mentality.

08:16.570 --> 08:17.835
Yeah, she's right.

08:17.837 --> 08:20.271
The car is the most
traceable piece of evidence

08:20.273 --> 08:21.673
back to the victims.

08:21.675 --> 08:23.508
Well, hey, it got our guy caught.

08:23.510 --> 08:26.037
I don't know the answer,
but there's got to be a reason.

08:26.039 --> 08:28.379
Okay, so I'm confused.

08:28.381 --> 08:30.715
What is it we're doing?

08:30.717 --> 08:32.984
Where are we supposed
to put our energies?

08:32.986 --> 08:34.986
Are we mounting a defense

08:34.988 --> 08:36.688
for the penalty phase of a trial

08:36.690 --> 08:38.511
which starts the day after tomorrow?

08:38.514 --> 08:40.491
Or are we launching

08:40.493 --> 08:44.195
an investigation to find a serial killer?

08:47.367 --> 08:48.766
Both.

09:04.649 --> 09:07.083
Morning.

09:09.446 --> 09:12.280
I need to prepare you for what's to come.

09:13.323 --> 09:14.756
Tomorrow, you are gonna walk

09:14.781 --> 09:16.748
into a room full of people

09:16.773 --> 09:19.240
who've already made up
their minds about you.

09:20.922 --> 09:22.846
I know it makes no sense,

09:22.848 --> 09:26.059
but I need you to show remorse

09:26.061 --> 09:28.661
for something you did not do.

09:32.267 --> 09:33.700
Look at me.

09:34.140 --> 09:35.668
Look, look at me.

09:35.670 --> 09:38.071
We have one goal, and one goal only,

09:38.073 --> 09:40.206
and that is to avoid your execution.

09:40.208 --> 09:42.041
The truth is that we may be
dealing with this verdict

09:42.043 --> 09:44.744
for years to come, but it's gonna be

09:44.746 --> 09:46.246
a hell of a lot easier if we don't have

09:46.248 --> 09:49.182
the ticking clock of a death sentence.

09:52.220 --> 09:53.720
Oh.

10:09.838 --> 10:11.738
How do they do what?

10:22.397 --> 10:24.024
Kill you.

10:25.987 --> 10:27.787
<i>Poor kid.</i>

10:27.789 --> 10:29.589
His record is absolutely clean.

10:29.591 --> 10:30.757
Never been arrested.

10:30.759 --> 10:32.625
Never had a problem with authorities.

10:32.627 --> 10:34.794
Not so much as a ticket for jaywalking.

10:36.598 --> 10:38.097
Anything I can do?

10:38.099 --> 10:39.666
I'm feeling kind of useless.

10:39.668 --> 10:42.001
Useless? Marissa, you are the key

10:42.003 --> 10:44.237
to everything.

10:45.086 --> 10:46.573
Shouldn't you be running

10:46.575 --> 10:49.042
some focus groups with our mirror jurors?

10:49.044 --> 10:50.210
It's a nice thought.

10:50.212 --> 10:52.312
Only problem is the algorithm we use,

10:52.314 --> 10:54.747
isn't set up for penalty phase hearings.

10:54.749 --> 10:56.786
Really? Why not?

10:56.788 --> 10:57.951
Well, think about it.

10:57.953 --> 11:00.320
A typical trial is
all about jurors gauging guilt

11:00.322 --> 11:02.789
or innocence, weighing the facts.

11:02.791 --> 11:05.124
But this trial, it's all about emotion,

11:05.126 --> 11:08.595
if they sympathize with Elliot
enough to spare his life.

11:09.235 --> 11:11.197
And I have no way to measure that.

11:11.199 --> 11:12.966
The algorithm won't translate.

11:21.943 --> 11:23.943
- Mrs. O'Neil?
- Yes?

11:23.945 --> 11:25.478
I'm Danny James... I'm a member

11:25.480 --> 11:26.980
of Elliot Mile" defense team.

11:27.796 --> 11:30.842
Okay, so... what can I do for you?

11:30.844 --> 11:32.378
The trial is over.

11:32.380 --> 11:34.242
They found the man
you're working for guilty.

11:34.244 --> 11:36.723
Well, right now we're working on
the penalty phase of the trial.

11:36.725 --> 11:38.791
Just wondered if I could ask
you a few more questions,

11:38.793 --> 11:40.893
just to make sure we
have everything right.

11:40.895 --> 11:42.595
Okay, but I don't get that.

11:42.597 --> 11:45.765
Do you have any I.D.,
any kind of credentials?

11:45.767 --> 11:48.001
Yeah.

11:51.371 --> 11:53.038
Hold on.

11:57.956 --> 11:59.646
Do you always wear glasses?

11:59.648 --> 12:01.214
Bifocals. I'm supposed to.

12:01.216 --> 12:03.209
Don't tell my optometrist.

12:03.640 --> 12:06.886
Well, do you happen to remember
the night of the murder,

12:06.888 --> 12:08.920
were you wearing them then?

12:09.796 --> 12:13.026
Mrs. O'Neil, you said
you saw Elliot Miles's face

12:13.028 --> 12:15.395
clearly enough to I.D. him.

12:16.231 --> 12:18.197
Yes. I did.

12:18.199 --> 12:20.733
I saw him coming out
of the Johnsons' house.

12:20.735 --> 12:22.969
He looked right at me. He was limping.

12:22.971 --> 12:25.104
He got in their car and drove away.

12:25.106 --> 12:27.603
Wait, limping?
Actually, during the trial,

12:27.605 --> 12:29.475
you said he was <i> running</i> out the door.

12:29.477 --> 12:31.844
Yes, okay, it was a figure of speech.

12:31.846 --> 12:34.728
He was moving fast, as fast as he could,

12:34.730 --> 12:36.149
but there was something wrong
with his leg,

12:36.151 --> 12:37.950
like he was injured or something.

12:37.952 --> 12:39.986
But you didn't mention that on the stand.

12:40.743 --> 12:42.822
Well, nobody asked.

12:45.060 --> 12:46.826
Dr. Bull?

12:48.293 --> 12:50.276
I need to talk to you about Molly O'Neil.

12:50.278 --> 12:51.651
- What about her?
- Well, I went and

12:51.676 --> 12:52.704
interviewed her yesterday,

12:52.706 --> 12:54.284
just grasping at straws.

12:54.286 --> 12:56.235
And the thing is,
she was wearing glasses.

12:56.237 --> 12:58.004
Glasses that she didn't have on in court.

12:58.006 --> 12:59.706
And she confessed to me that she

12:59.708 --> 13:02.308
didn't have them on when she
supposedly saw Elliot, either.

13:02.310 --> 13:04.377
Not earth-shattering,
but certainly interesting.

13:04.379 --> 13:06.045
Well, wait, it gets better.

13:06.047 --> 13:08.815
I think I know why the killer
had to steal the car that night.

13:08.817 --> 13:11.250
Molly told me that when she saw
the killer, he was limping.

13:11.252 --> 13:12.819
Wait a second.

13:12.821 --> 13:14.787
Elliot mentioned that, too.

13:14.789 --> 13:16.289
Maybe our killer was injured.

13:16.291 --> 13:18.091
- But injured how?
- I don't know.

13:18.093 --> 13:19.926
Maybe he fell down the stairs,
maybe he got in a fight

13:19.928 --> 13:21.060
with the husband... who cares?

13:21.062 --> 13:22.328
- The point is...
- It was never

13:22.330 --> 13:23.963
part of the plan.

13:38.593 --> 13:39.946
Today's gonna be hard.

13:40.553 --> 13:42.532
Friends and family of the Johnsons

13:42.534 --> 13:44.350
are gonna get up and talk
about the devastation

13:44.352 --> 13:46.686
this has caused to their lives.

13:47.602 --> 13:50.189
You remember how we talked about...

13:50.647 --> 13:53.393
the appearance of remorse?

13:55.318 --> 13:57.764
This is what I was talking about.

13:59.701 --> 14:01.449
Please.

14:05.306 --> 14:07.978
Oh, Chunk. Hey.

14:07.980 --> 14:09.942
I need your help with something.

14:09.944 --> 14:11.778
Just, uh, lined up a new witness,

14:11.780 --> 14:13.179
an expert in criminology.

14:13.181 --> 14:15.214
Guy's testified in dozens
of murder trials.

14:15.216 --> 14:17.083
I need you to run him through his paces,

14:17.085 --> 14:18.351
make sure he sticks to what's relevant.

14:18.353 --> 14:20.319
- All right. Let me at him.
- Fair warning:

14:20.885 --> 14:23.923
he's very resistant to the
idea of being prepped at all.

14:24.222 --> 14:26.312
Okay. When's he coming in?

14:26.314 --> 14:28.661
He's not. He won't.

14:28.663 --> 14:30.463
He only agreed to sit down for
a couple of hours

14:30.465 --> 14:31.864
on the day of his testimony.

14:31.866 --> 14:33.800
I'll arrange for you to do it in there.

14:33.802 --> 14:36.736
- Okay? Got to get to court.
- All right, good luck.

14:38.829 --> 14:41.307
My very first memory is of my mother,

14:41.864 --> 14:43.866
putting a Band-Aid on my elbow.

14:45.285 --> 14:47.211
I don't remember how I hurt it.

14:47.213 --> 14:49.081
All I remember is that
when she kissed it,

14:49.083 --> 14:50.790
the pain disappeared.

14:52.554 --> 14:54.353
The pain you've caused me...

14:55.044 --> 14:57.557
will never disappear.

14:57.559 --> 15:00.758
When you killed my parents,
you broke my heart.

15:03.052 --> 15:05.865
My dad taught me how to make lasagna

15:05.867 --> 15:07.834
and how to throw a football.

15:08.349 --> 15:11.070
He would let me paint his nails
with sparkly polish.

15:12.040 --> 15:14.807
And I'll never be able to do that again.

15:15.648 --> 15:18.110
I wish I had more
than just these memories,

15:18.459 --> 15:19.525
but I don't.

15:19.527 --> 15:21.543
When you did what you did...

15:22.363 --> 15:24.397
when you burned down our house,

15:24.399 --> 15:26.766
you took everything.

15:26.768 --> 15:28.935
Every picture,

15:28.937 --> 15:30.903
every birthday present,

15:30.905 --> 15:34.874
every single thing that tied me to them.

15:36.294 --> 15:39.130
I'm afraid to fall asleep at night,

15:39.447 --> 15:42.849
'cause all I ever dream about
is my mom and dad

15:42.851 --> 15:45.218
burning in that fire.

15:46.054 --> 15:48.187
My parents taught me

15:48.189 --> 15:52.325
that everyone deserves love and kindness.

15:53.628 --> 15:56.230
Do you deserve my love and kindness?

15:58.600 --> 16:00.568
I don't think you do.

16:14.834 --> 16:17.263
- What am I looking at?
- It's a receipt for cigarettes.

16:17.288 --> 16:19.190
The police found it in the back
of the Johnsons' car.

16:19.192 --> 16:21.158
Turns out it's from a store
that Amy Johnson,

16:21.160 --> 16:23.861
one of the victims,
shopped at on the day she died.

16:23.863 --> 16:27.312
Probably why everyone overlooked
it in the first place.

16:27.862 --> 16:29.880
What do you mean? Overlooked it how?

16:29.882 --> 16:32.449
- You okay?
- Yeah. My hand fell asleep.

16:32.451 --> 16:34.584
Whole damn arm, actually.

16:34.586 --> 16:36.720
Doesn't your arm ever fall asleep?

16:36.722 --> 16:38.272
No.

16:39.625 --> 16:41.258
You were saying?

16:41.651 --> 16:44.094
Well, the receipt can't belong
to any of the victims.

16:44.096 --> 16:46.630
Autopsy says neither Amy
nor her husband smoked.

16:46.632 --> 16:49.466
And because of his disability,
neither does Elliot.

16:49.468 --> 16:51.035
So it can't be his.

16:52.604 --> 16:54.971
Wait a second.
So you're thinking the killer

16:54.973 --> 16:56.706
bought these cigarettes
and then accidentally dropped

16:56.708 --> 16:59.009
the receipt in the car when he stole it?

16:59.011 --> 17:00.877
We know from the debris in the kitchen

17:00.879 --> 17:02.813
that Amy went to the store that day.

17:02.815 --> 17:04.134
It's a block and a half from her house.

17:04.136 --> 17:07.359
What if she walked to the store,
and the killer saw her there

17:07.362 --> 17:09.653
and followed her home on foot?

17:10.512 --> 17:11.954
There's a time stamp on the receipt.

17:11.957 --> 17:14.156
If the store has security cameras,

17:14.159 --> 17:17.560
maybe we use it to check the footage?

17:19.364 --> 17:21.231
This is great.

17:21.233 --> 17:22.598
This is...

17:22.601 --> 17:24.334
Get this to Danny.

17:24.336 --> 17:25.902
And see if you can get everybody in here

17:25.904 --> 17:28.505
before I go to court.

17:30.825 --> 17:34.744
Your identity is
clearly wrapped up in your work,

17:34.746 --> 17:37.347
which means that it's
inherently wrapped up

17:37.349 --> 17:39.482
in the man you work <i> for.</i>

17:39.484 --> 17:41.852
I mean, basically, what you're telling me

17:41.854 --> 17:46.089
is that... you can't be you without him.

17:46.091 --> 17:47.324
Oh, I don't know.

17:47.326 --> 17:49.860
He leads a messy life.

17:49.862 --> 17:52.929
Someone has to help clean up.

17:52.931 --> 17:54.531
Marissa Morgan...

17:54.533 --> 17:56.350
you <i> like</i> it.

17:57.768 --> 18:00.537
<i>I think I've been playing
this whole thing all wrong.</i>

18:01.640 --> 18:02.939
We keep thinking

18:02.941 --> 18:05.842
we have to respect the jury's decision.

18:05.844 --> 18:08.011
Well, we don't.

18:08.013 --> 18:10.013
And we're not going to.

18:10.015 --> 18:11.982
You think it's hard sending a guilty man

18:11.984 --> 18:13.216
to the electric chair?

18:13.218 --> 18:15.418
Try sending an innocent one.

18:15.420 --> 18:17.487
From now on, our job in that courtroom

18:17.489 --> 18:19.289
is to make every single one

18:19.291 --> 18:21.024
of those jurors doubt themselves.

18:21.026 --> 18:22.543
Make them...

18:22.995 --> 18:24.794
regret their decision.

18:24.796 --> 18:26.830
Make them realize...

18:26.832 --> 18:29.833
Elliot is an innocent man.

18:29.835 --> 18:33.403
Wow. The judge isn't gonna
let us just call witnesses

18:33.405 --> 18:36.172
to the stand so we can
re-adjudicate Elliot's guilt.

18:36.174 --> 18:37.140
Well...

18:37.142 --> 18:40.510
the witnesses will all be there,
for legitimate reasons,

18:40.512 --> 18:44.347
but they may say some things
that cast doubt on the verdict.

18:44.349 --> 18:46.216
Isn't the prosecutor
just going to object?

18:46.218 --> 18:48.285
Then we withdraw the question...

18:48.287 --> 18:51.197
hopefully, after the witness
has given his or her answer.

18:51.723 --> 18:53.156
It's worth a try.

18:53.158 --> 18:55.692
We know from our research
that any information

18:55.694 --> 18:58.261
the jury hears, they
take it into consideration.

18:58.263 --> 19:01.264
Regardless of the judge's
rulings on relevance.

19:01.266 --> 19:02.766
Well, the criminologist

19:02.768 --> 19:04.701
I'm prepping has already
been deemed relevant.

19:04.703 --> 19:07.137
Maybe I can get him to skew his testimony

19:07.139 --> 19:10.040
toward the idea that the
crime fits the profile

19:10.042 --> 19:11.508
of a psychopath.

19:11.510 --> 19:13.810
I'd love to get that
neighbor back on the stand.

19:13.812 --> 19:16.179
Have her testify that she
wasn't wearing her glasses,

19:16.181 --> 19:18.330
- that the man had a limp.
- That's a great idea.

19:18.332 --> 19:19.837
We should all get down to the courthouse.

19:19.839 --> 19:22.686
Chunk, your criminologist is up
first. You won't have much time.

19:22.688 --> 19:24.522
Yep, I'm on it.

19:32.898 --> 19:35.241
This must be some kind of joke.

19:36.034 --> 19:37.634
Professor Jameson?

19:37.636 --> 19:40.303
Mr. Palmer. I should have known

19:40.305 --> 19:42.973
that your company would
somehow be involved in this.

19:42.975 --> 19:45.508
Professor Jameson, look, uh...

19:45.510 --> 19:49.346
I'm sure the thought
of working with me is highly...

19:49.348 --> 19:52.349
unsettling to you. And...

19:52.351 --> 19:54.684
- Huh.
- I cannot lie, the idea of spending

19:54.686 --> 19:58.755
my next half hour with you is
not setting my heart aflutter.

19:58.757 --> 20:00.766
But the truth is...

20:01.426 --> 20:03.519
you're getting paid and so am I.

20:04.863 --> 20:06.522
And more importantly...

20:07.265 --> 20:12.035
your testimony is crucial
to our case and to our client.

20:12.683 --> 20:13.946
Well...

20:15.007 --> 20:17.440
you're right about one thing...

20:17.442 --> 20:19.442
I <i> am</i> getting paid.

20:19.952 --> 20:21.845
But I can't imagine
what you're gonna tell me

20:21.847 --> 20:23.279
that I don't already know.

20:23.831 --> 20:26.316
You talk down to people, sir.

20:26.318 --> 20:28.018
And you can't do that to this jury,

20:28.020 --> 20:29.319
or you're going to lose them.

20:29.321 --> 20:31.688
So I need you to watch them,

20:31.690 --> 20:32.956
read their cues.

20:32.958 --> 20:35.191
If they're fidgety, you're boring them.

20:35.885 --> 20:38.461
On the other hand, if
they're leaning in...

20:38.929 --> 20:40.964
they're excited, they want more.

20:40.966 --> 20:43.400
We're talking about
a court of law, Mr. Palmer.

20:43.402 --> 20:45.535
It's not about how much they like me.

20:45.537 --> 20:47.470
It's about my expertise.

20:47.472 --> 20:49.897
It's about what I know that they don't.

20:49.899 --> 20:52.942
No, it's not about you
at all; it's about them.

20:52.944 --> 20:55.979
I need you to take them on a
journey with your testimony.

20:55.981 --> 20:58.114
I need you to tell them a story.

20:58.116 --> 20:59.382
Hmm.

20:59.992 --> 21:03.053
Based... on your read of the evidence,

21:03.055 --> 21:05.255
describe our killer.

21:06.658 --> 21:10.427
Clearly, he's an individual
with a personality disorder

21:10.429 --> 21:14.464
characterized by persistent
antisocial behavior,

21:14.466 --> 21:16.433
impaired empathy, impaired remorse,

21:16.435 --> 21:18.168
as well as bold...

21:18.678 --> 21:22.772
disinhibited and, uh, egotistic traits.

21:24.517 --> 21:26.543
Are you serious?

21:28.312 --> 21:30.346
Why not just use the word "psychopath"?

21:31.023 --> 21:32.382
If you use the word "psychopath,"

21:32.384 --> 21:34.317
you will have that jury's attention.

21:34.319 --> 21:36.286
Trust me, I already have
the jury's attention...

21:36.288 --> 21:40.023
so much so that the people
paying you requested <i> me.</i>

21:40.025 --> 21:43.119
Yeah? Well, they told me
I needed to work with you.

21:43.995 --> 21:45.695
Say "psychopath."

21:45.697 --> 21:47.597
- I will not.
- Well, you should.

21:47.599 --> 21:50.300
The fact is, you may be
an expert in your field,

21:50.302 --> 21:54.404
Professor Jameson, but
I am an expert in mine.

21:54.406 --> 21:55.999
And you need me.

21:56.001 --> 21:57.633
Dr. Jameson,

21:58.376 --> 22:00.910
what was your first reaction

22:00.912 --> 22:04.647
when you heard about the murders
of Amy and Matt Johnson

22:04.649 --> 22:07.617
and the apprehension of Elliot Miles?

22:07.619 --> 22:09.452
I was perplexed.

22:09.454 --> 22:11.721
The assistant U.S. attorney
has characterized it

22:11.723 --> 22:14.424
as a crime of opportunity,

22:14.426 --> 22:17.627
a theory that I strongly disagree with.

22:17.629 --> 22:20.096
There are very clear indications

22:20.098 --> 22:23.933
that signal it was not
a crime of opportunity,

22:23.935 --> 22:27.103
but rather a crime that was
committed in a methodical

22:27.105 --> 22:29.305
and purposeful way.

22:29.307 --> 22:30.874
In fact,

22:30.876 --> 22:34.144
the entire pathology of the crime

22:34.146 --> 22:37.514
speaks to a very different type
of criminal.

22:37.516 --> 22:39.849
And what kind of criminal would that be?

22:50.269 --> 22:52.162
A psychopath.

22:58.703 --> 23:00.654
Let me tell you a story.

23:01.373 --> 23:05.408
A man walks into a small, suburban house

23:05.410 --> 23:08.711
with the sole purpose
of sexually assaulting

23:08.713 --> 23:10.180
a woman who is home alone,

23:10.182 --> 23:12.315
- unpacking her groceries.
- Objection.

23:12.317 --> 23:15.151
We're not here to listen to
the professor's interpretation

23:15.153 --> 23:16.719
of facts we've already adjudicated.

23:16.721 --> 23:18.521
I'm trusting
that this is going to lead us

23:18.523 --> 23:20.456
to a place that will be of use
to the jurors

23:20.458 --> 23:22.692
as they contemplate
the defendant's punishment.

23:22.694 --> 23:24.360
You have my word, Your Honor.

23:24.362 --> 23:25.895
You may proceed.

23:25.897 --> 23:27.586
The husband interrupts.

23:27.588 --> 23:30.533
The perpetrator panics.
He kills them both.

23:30.976 --> 23:33.269
Or so they would have you believe.

23:33.687 --> 23:36.806
But if this was a decision

23:36.808 --> 23:38.241
that was made in haste,

23:38.243 --> 23:41.778
where did he get the rope
to restrain his victims?

23:41.780 --> 23:44.280
And where did he get the accelerant

23:44.282 --> 23:46.282
to start the fire?

23:47.686 --> 23:51.288
When psychopaths commit a homicide,

23:52.165 --> 23:56.159
the killings are planned,
purposeful, and organized,

23:56.161 --> 23:59.295
- just like this one here was.
- Your Honor.

23:59.297 --> 24:00.830
What's the point of all this?

24:00.832 --> 24:02.932
Is the defense going to ask a question?

24:02.934 --> 24:04.234
I'd be happy to, Your Honor.

24:04.236 --> 24:07.103
Is there any other evidence
that points to a psychopath?

24:07.105 --> 24:10.139
In-Indeed. And I'm not sure
the jury is aware of this,

24:10.141 --> 24:14.344
but there was a ring sent to the FBI.

24:14.979 --> 24:17.447
It was Matt Johnson's ring.

24:17.648 --> 24:19.582
His class ring.

24:19.584 --> 24:21.725
And it's been missing since the murders.

24:21.727 --> 24:23.553
Objection. Witness
is referring to evidence

24:23.555 --> 24:24.754
that has not been presented

24:24.756 --> 24:26.356
because it has been deemed irrelevant.

24:26.358 --> 24:29.092
By who? It's evidence.

24:29.094 --> 24:31.894
Denying it exists
does a disservice to the jury,

24:31.896 --> 24:33.230
my client, and the entire

24:33.255 --> 24:35.098
system of justice.

24:35.100 --> 24:38.101
Gentlemen. Mr. Colón,
you are on thin ice here.

24:39.304 --> 24:41.037
May I rephrase?

24:41.039 --> 24:42.472
The ring was not expensive,

24:42.474 --> 24:44.607
so it wasn't stolen to be sold later.

24:44.609 --> 24:48.511
So why did the killer take a useless,

24:48.513 --> 24:52.849
easily identifiable piece of memorabilia?

24:55.120 --> 24:57.420
He wanted a trophy.

24:57.422 --> 24:59.222
- A trophy?
- A souvenir.

24:59.224 --> 25:02.925
It represents the killer's power
over his victims.

25:02.927 --> 25:05.628
It helps him to preserve the memory,

25:05.630 --> 25:07.830
the excitement of the kill.

25:07.832 --> 25:09.599
Dahmer did it.

25:09.601 --> 25:13.202
Bundy, Gacy, they did it, too.

25:13.204 --> 25:14.971
So, just to be clear,

25:14.973 --> 25:16.472
are you saying

25:16.474 --> 25:20.310
that my client, Elliot Miles,
is a psychopath?

25:20.836 --> 25:22.845
Not in the slightest.

25:22.847 --> 25:25.882
I'm...

25:25.884 --> 25:28.885
I'm sorry, I'm-I'm confused.

25:28.887 --> 25:32.655
Didn't you just say the crime
was committed by a psychopath?

25:32.657 --> 25:33.641
It was.

25:34.359 --> 25:37.560
But I've been through Mr. Mile"
psychological history,

25:37.562 --> 25:41.464
and he exhibits zero signs

25:41.941 --> 25:43.633
of psychopathy.

25:43.635 --> 25:46.331
He has healthy emotional attachments.

25:46.333 --> 25:50.139
No signs of psychological
distancing or manipulation.

25:50.141 --> 25:54.077
In fact, it is my professional opinion

25:54.578 --> 25:56.579
that Mr. Miles

25:57.331 --> 25:58.548
is psychologically

25:58.550 --> 26:01.622
incapable of having committed this crime.

26:01.624 --> 26:03.794
Objection. What are we doing here?

26:03.796 --> 26:05.955
This man was clearly
brought in to relitigate

26:05.957 --> 26:07.721
the defendant's guilt or innocence.

26:07.723 --> 26:09.192
I-I was just stating

26:09.194 --> 26:10.827
my professional opinion, Your Honor.

26:10.829 --> 26:14.364
Mr. Colón, you made this court a promise.

26:14.366 --> 26:17.017
And I believe with all my heart
that I kept it.

26:17.502 --> 26:19.068
In any event,

26:19.070 --> 26:21.814
I have no further question
for the witness, Your Honor.

26:26.378 --> 26:28.745
I have just one question for you, Doctor.

26:28.747 --> 26:30.446
After committing the murders,
the killer stole

26:30.448 --> 26:31.514
the couples' car.

26:31.516 --> 26:33.249
That seems like an incredibly sloppy

26:33.251 --> 26:34.517
and uncalculated move,

26:34.519 --> 26:35.752
something not at all in line

26:35.754 --> 26:37.720
with the behavior of a psychopath.

26:37.722 --> 26:39.188
Can you give the jury a way

26:39.190 --> 26:41.457
to reconcile that?

26:41.459 --> 26:43.126
Well, you're right.

26:43.128 --> 26:46.596
That-that only makes sense
if it was out of necessity.

26:47.006 --> 26:48.664
I don't understand.

26:48.666 --> 26:51.667
Perhaps the killer was injured
in the commission of the crime.

26:51.669 --> 26:53.770
Perhaps there was an altercation,

26:53.772 --> 26:56.439
maybe with the husband? "Perhaps"?

26:57.406 --> 26:58.841
"Maybe"?

26:58.843 --> 27:00.610
Well, perhaps you haven't heard,

27:00.612 --> 27:02.612
but we're not in the business
of suppositions.

27:02.614 --> 27:05.148
Or maybe you just forgot,
but here in a court of law,

27:05.150 --> 27:07.583
what jurors want are facts.

27:07.585 --> 27:09.278
Not guesses.

27:10.054 --> 27:12.322
No further questions, Your Honor.

27:13.365 --> 27:16.793
So, Danny got the security footage

27:16.795 --> 27:19.896
from the store where the
cigarettes were purchased.

27:19.898 --> 27:22.165
And based off of the time
stamp on the receipts,

27:22.167 --> 27:23.917
this is our guy.

27:31.209 --> 27:32.885
That's him.

27:35.680 --> 27:37.389
That's our killer.

27:38.216 --> 27:40.100
He does exist.

27:40.718 --> 27:42.752
Cable, can we get
this image a little clearer?

27:42.754 --> 27:43.853
Definitely gonna run it

27:43.855 --> 27:45.403
through facial recognition software.

27:45.405 --> 27:47.790
And what are the chances
it'll actually find a match?

27:47.792 --> 27:49.044
Probably narrow it down to

27:49.069 --> 27:51.260
- a few hundred possible suspects.
- That's it?

27:51.262 --> 27:52.462
That's the best we can do?

27:52.464 --> 27:54.530
No. That's just the first step.

27:54.532 --> 27:56.532
Cable and I, you and Marissa,
we'll parse the list.

27:56.534 --> 27:57.667
Narrow it down

27:57.669 --> 27:58.734
to who could've physically been

27:58.736 --> 28:00.136
at that location at that time.

28:00.138 --> 28:01.504
With any luck,

28:01.506 --> 28:03.272
that'll get us down
to maybe low double digits.

28:03.274 --> 28:04.541
Good.

28:05.510 --> 28:09.463
In the meantime, let's find this guy.

28:17.443 --> 28:19.143
<i>Dear Bull,</i>

28:19.145 --> 28:21.712
<i>I apologize for not discussing this</i>

28:21.714 --> 28:24.048
<i>with you face-to-face,</i>

28:24.050 --> 28:25.916
<i>but I just can't do it.</i>

28:25.918 --> 28:28.752
<i>I've been seeing a psychiatrist
for the last little while,</i>

28:28.754 --> 28:32.790
<i>trying to figure out
why I'm not happier than I am.</i>

28:32.792 --> 28:34.792
<i>There are, of course,</i>

28:34.794 --> 28:37.061
<i>a hundred answers to that question,</i>

28:37.063 --> 28:39.784
<i>but clearly, one of them is that I've had</i>

28:39.786 --> 28:41.432
<i>the terrible ill fortune</i>

28:41.434 --> 28:43.434
<i>to have found myself working for someone</i>

28:43.436 --> 28:45.869
<i>I adore more than words can describe</i>

28:45.871 --> 28:48.672
<i>at an enterprise that gives me
more satisfaction</i>

28:48.674 --> 28:51.911
<i>than anyone has a right to expect.</i>

28:51.913 --> 28:53.944
<i>Sadly, I have come to realize</i>

28:53.946 --> 28:57.014
<i>that I am so consumed with you and TAC</i>

28:57.016 --> 28:58.983
<i>that there is very little me left</i>

28:58.985 --> 29:01.318
<i>for the rest that life has to offer.</i>

29:01.320 --> 29:05.189
<i>I am therefore tendering my resignation.</i>

29:05.191 --> 29:06.623
<i>I hope you'll accept it,</i>

29:06.625 --> 29:09.393
<i>knowing that it is being
offered reluctantly,</i>

29:09.395 --> 29:12.196
<i>that I am actually sure of very little...</i>

29:12.198 --> 29:14.732
<i>except this.</i>

29:14.734 --> 29:17.134
<i>You have changed my life,</i>

29:17.136 --> 29:18.402
<i>and the memory of working with you</i>

29:18.404 --> 29:21.405
<i>is something I will always carry with me.</i>

29:21.407 --> 29:24.775
<i>You're an amazing man, Jason Bull.</i>

29:24.777 --> 29:26.110
<i>And if I am tough on you,</i>

29:26.112 --> 29:28.746
<i>it is only because I hold you
in such high regard</i>

29:28.748 --> 29:30.881
<i>that I cannot bear to see you be less</i>

29:30.883 --> 29:32.921
<i>than I know you are capable of.</i>

29:33.755 --> 29:35.352
<i>Thanks for being alive.</i>

29:35.841 --> 29:36.887
<i>Marissa.</i>

29:36.889 --> 29:39.757
<i>P.S. I am happy to leave</i>

29:39.759 --> 29:42.973
<i>at whatever time or date
works best for you.</i>

29:46.332 --> 29:48.265
- Excuse me.
- Ah!

29:48.267 --> 29:50.100
I'm sorry.
I-I didn't mean to frighten you.

29:50.102 --> 29:52.736
I'm-I'm looking for Chunk Palmer.

29:52.738 --> 29:55.072
Uh, it's barely 7:30 in the morning,

29:55.074 --> 29:56.515
and he's on his way to court.

29:56.517 --> 29:58.409
I have a seminar to get to.

29:58.411 --> 30:00.911
Uh, could you give Mr. Palmer
a message for me?

30:00.913 --> 30:02.212
Certainly.

30:02.214 --> 30:06.016
Tell him that Professor Jameson
learned a lot yesterday,

30:06.018 --> 30:07.751
and if he's willing,

30:07.753 --> 30:10.054
I would love for him to come
and lecture to my class

30:10.056 --> 30:12.189
about trial science sometime.

30:12.878 --> 30:15.059
I'd be happy to give him the message.

30:15.464 --> 30:17.174
Thank you.

30:22.902 --> 30:25.235
Your Honor,
the defense would like to call

30:25.237 --> 30:27.237
Molly O'Neil to the stand.

30:27.239 --> 30:30.307
Objection. Relevance?

30:30.309 --> 30:33.544
Mrs. O'Neil testified
that she observed the killer

30:33.546 --> 30:36.213
in the immediate aftermath of the murder.

30:36.215 --> 30:37.981
I would think that her
impressions of that man

30:37.983 --> 30:40.017
would be highly relevant
to a group of people

30:40.019 --> 30:42.886
trying to decide whether or
not to put someone to death.

30:42.888 --> 30:45.589
Your Honor, this is yet another
thinly veiled attempt

30:45.591 --> 30:48.692
to offer irrelevant
and unduly prejudicial evidence.

30:48.694 --> 30:50.627
I mean, first the criminologist,
and now this?

30:50.629 --> 30:52.162
This is an obvious attempt

30:52.164 --> 30:53.409
- on the defense's part
- Come on, Benny.

30:53.434 --> 30:55.232
To use the penalty phase...
...to relitigate this case.

30:55.234 --> 30:57.234
I can assure you, we
have no such intention.

30:57.236 --> 30:58.869
- I...
- Mr. Colón, I have given you

30:58.871 --> 31:00.938
a lot of latitude, but this
is where I draw the line.

31:00.940 --> 31:03.307
Your behavior is disrespectful

31:03.309 --> 31:05.297
of the jury's decision to convict.

31:05.299 --> 31:07.778
I'm denying your request
to call Mrs. O'Neil.

31:08.747 --> 31:11.115
I'm also holding you
in contempt and fining you

31:11.117 --> 31:14.318
$5,000, and if you try to pull
something like this again,

31:14.320 --> 31:16.483
you can spend the remainder
of this trial in the lockup.

31:17.789 --> 31:19.223
Yes, Your Honor.

31:19.225 --> 31:21.692
I apologize, Your Honor.

31:23.596 --> 31:26.663
Facial recognition
came back with 172 matches

31:26.665 --> 31:28.565
for the guy in the video
buying those cigarettes.

31:28.567 --> 31:30.868
All these guys live in the tristate area.

31:30.870 --> 31:33.170
Marissa, Danny and I then narrowed down

31:33.172 --> 31:35.806
the 172 men to eight.

31:36.670 --> 31:38.801
Ladies and gentleman,

31:38.803 --> 31:40.310
meet our suspects.

31:40.312 --> 31:41.445
It's like <i> The Bachelorette,</i>

31:41.447 --> 31:43.480
except these guys might be killers.

31:44.720 --> 31:46.283
It's just a question

31:46.285 --> 31:48.318
of how we turn these eight into one.

31:48.320 --> 31:50.053
And how were you able to determine

31:50.055 --> 31:52.523
that all eight of these men
were near the crime scene?

31:52.525 --> 31:54.124
I got their approximate locations

31:54.126 --> 31:56.560
at the time of the fire
from cell phone towers.

31:56.562 --> 31:58.996
All these guys were close
enough to the Johnsons' house

31:58.998 --> 32:00.986
to have theoretically
committed the crime.

32:01.867 --> 32:03.700
Okay.

32:04.156 --> 32:05.402
Let's winnow.

32:06.450 --> 32:08.739
We're looking for
someone with detachment,

32:08.741 --> 32:11.041
an emotional distance
from those around him.

32:11.043 --> 32:12.743
That's you.

32:13.579 --> 32:16.113
So someone with very few friends.

32:16.115 --> 32:17.548
I mean, look

32:17.550 --> 32:20.651
at these profiles, Bull.
They all have friends.

32:20.653 --> 32:23.787
Yes and no.

32:23.789 --> 32:26.490
Psychopaths
can be superficially charming.

32:26.492 --> 32:27.891
Even those closest

32:27.893 --> 32:30.527
to them may not know
their relationship is...

32:30.529 --> 32:32.663
isn't built on any real feeling.

32:32.665 --> 32:33.864
Here, look at this guy.

32:33.866 --> 32:37.067
Psychopaths tend to be
Internet trolls, bullies.

32:37.069 --> 32:39.870
Well, four of these guys fit that bill.

32:39.872 --> 32:41.371
All right, let's get rid of the others.

32:42.903 --> 32:46.376
I'm looking for a grandiose
sense of self-importance.

32:46.378 --> 32:49.846
Psychopaths feel they're
not just better than others.

32:49.848 --> 32:51.448
They're more important than others.

32:51.450 --> 32:54.051
Their lives are worth more

32:54.053 --> 32:56.587
than others. Other people
are like cockroaches.

32:56.589 --> 32:58.989
Waiting to be stepped on or tortured.

32:59.586 --> 33:00.991
Or killed.

33:01.463 --> 33:02.793
Look at these two.

33:03.215 --> 33:04.595
They both have a tsunami

33:04.597 --> 33:06.051
of selfies.

33:07.166 --> 33:09.299
Dozens of them.

33:09.301 --> 33:11.134
No one else in the photo.

33:11.136 --> 33:13.470
No one else in the world.

33:15.143 --> 33:16.907
It's one of these two.

33:17.396 --> 33:19.147
Any criminal record?

33:19.612 --> 33:21.745
Uh, John Fuller had

33:21.747 --> 33:24.948
a drunk driving offense six years back.

33:24.950 --> 33:27.317
Wayne Norton has several
juvenile arrests,

33:27.319 --> 33:29.786
all stemming from aggressive
behavior in school.

33:29.788 --> 33:30.988
This is 20 years old.

33:30.990 --> 33:32.589
Playground incident at school.

33:32.591 --> 33:33.957
Wayne was 11.

33:33.959 --> 33:36.093
It's from a social worker's report.

33:36.095 --> 33:38.862
"He broke the other child's arm.

33:38.864 --> 33:40.430
"They were out on the playground.

33:40.432 --> 33:42.165
"Teacher had only looked away
for a minute.

33:42.167 --> 33:44.368
"I am concerned because Wayne
does not seem

33:44.370 --> 33:46.336
"to feel badly about what he did.

33:46.338 --> 33:49.039
"When I asked him about it,
he shrugged it off.

33:49.041 --> 33:52.776
"He wasn't scared, or nervous or guilty.

33:52.778 --> 33:54.077
"The teacher mentioned
that Wayne just stared

33:54.079 --> 33:56.046
at the other child while he cried."

33:56.048 --> 33:57.648
Kind of textbook, isn't it?

33:57.650 --> 33:59.516
Classic detachment.

33:59.518 --> 34:01.351
I think we found our man.

34:04.290 --> 34:05.922
What are you smiling at?

34:05.924 --> 34:08.625
Uh, no, no. I'm-I'm not smiling.

34:08.627 --> 34:12.062
I'm just... having a flashback.

34:12.063 --> 34:13.243
A good one.

34:13.931 --> 34:15.954
So you really think this is our guy?

34:19.638 --> 34:20.971
8-8-9.

34:20.973 --> 34:22.396
Do we know the street?

34:22.398 --> 34:24.507
Sure do. Brisk Street.

34:25.045 --> 34:26.152
Okay.

34:26.155 --> 34:27.744
So what happens now?

34:27.746 --> 34:29.112
Well, I can get this information
to the FBI,

34:29.114 --> 34:30.681
have them jump on it.

34:30.683 --> 34:32.349
It's 7:30 at night.

34:32.351 --> 34:34.451
Nobody's jumping on anything.

34:34.453 --> 34:35.886
Can't even call the police.

34:35.888 --> 34:37.120
We have no proof.

34:37.121 --> 34:38.755
And tomorrow Elliot takes the stand

34:38.757 --> 34:40.489
in his own defense, and then...

34:40.492 --> 34:41.792
Is my car out front?

34:41.793 --> 34:43.360
- Should be.
- All right.

34:43.773 --> 34:46.763
Well, there's nothing more
to be done tonight.

34:46.764 --> 34:49.333
To be continued.

34:52.199 --> 34:54.063
Nice work, Danny.

34:54.065 --> 34:56.739
Cable, Marissa, Chunk.

34:56.742 --> 34:58.675
Bravo.

34:58.677 --> 35:00.210
I'll see you tomorrow.

35:02.493 --> 35:04.226
Night.

35:34.313 --> 35:36.079
Is this Wayne Norton's house?

35:41.581 --> 35:43.019
Can I help you?

35:43.021 --> 35:44.688
Perhaps.

35:44.690 --> 35:46.289
Are you Mrs. Norton?

35:46.291 --> 35:48.091
Is your husband home?

35:48.093 --> 35:51.027
No. He's working.

35:51.029 --> 35:52.592
Who are you?

35:53.843 --> 35:55.637
You don't know me.

35:56.602 --> 35:58.368
I have a hunch about you.

35:59.715 --> 36:01.571
I think maybe you've been
worried about your husband

36:01.573 --> 36:03.019
for a long time.

36:03.375 --> 36:05.041
I think maybe you found something

36:05.043 --> 36:07.611
that... confirmed your worst fears,

36:07.613 --> 36:09.212
I think you put it in a box,

36:09.214 --> 36:10.547
sent it off in hopes that maybe,

36:11.194 --> 36:13.250
someone would understand.

36:13.252 --> 36:14.918
I don't know what you're talking about.

36:14.920 --> 36:16.653
I think you do.

36:18.157 --> 36:21.625
Get off my property
before I call the police.

36:21.627 --> 36:23.126
No, you won't.

36:23.128 --> 36:24.394
If you're willing to do that,

36:24.396 --> 36:26.830
you would have already done it by now.

36:29.254 --> 36:32.936
You know, someone else
is gonna die for his crime.

36:32.938 --> 36:35.639
And that's gonna up
the body count by one,

36:35.641 --> 36:38.675
except this time, it'll be your fault.

36:41.113 --> 36:42.684
You need to turn him in.

36:44.769 --> 36:46.521
They'll make sure you're safe.

36:48.053 --> 36:51.054
They'll make sure
that he never hurts you,

36:51.056 --> 36:53.278
or anyone else ever again.

36:57.490 --> 36:59.429
Get off my property.

37:07.439 --> 37:09.294
That's for when you change your mind.

37:22.434 --> 37:24.965
Elliot, I know you're angry,

37:24.967 --> 37:27.738
and you have every right to be.

37:28.526 --> 37:30.893
But now is your chance to tell

37:30.895 --> 37:33.068
your side of the story.

37:34.194 --> 37:35.797
No one's gonna be questioning you,

37:35.799 --> 37:37.933
not me or the prosecutor.

37:37.935 --> 37:41.169
Just you, and your interpreter,

37:41.701 --> 37:45.040
telling the jury why they
should spare your life.

37:48.546 --> 37:51.179
He wants to know where Dr. Bull is.

37:54.251 --> 37:56.018
I don't know where Dr. Bull is.

37:56.633 --> 37:58.654
I wish I knew.

37:58.656 --> 38:00.255
I'm-I'm hoping, I'm-I'm guessing

38:00.257 --> 38:01.757
that-that he's still on his way,

38:01.759 --> 38:06.406
but no matter where he is,
he'd want you to give

38:06.408 --> 38:08.895
what you're about to do
some serious thought.

38:14.872 --> 38:17.696
I'm going to tell
them that I didn't do it.

38:18.676 --> 38:22.492
I'm going to tell them they're fools.

38:22.980 --> 38:24.379
And that God

38:24.953 --> 38:28.584
will remember what they did today.

38:30.792 --> 38:34.356
Trust me. Please.
Y-You don't want to do that.

38:34.358 --> 38:36.692
You want to ask them for mercy.

38:37.507 --> 38:40.176
You want to ask them to spare your life.

38:44.568 --> 38:46.501
Mr. Miles.

38:46.503 --> 38:49.571
Do you have something
to say to this jury or not?

39:05.356 --> 39:06.588
I didn't do it.

39:08.225 --> 39:09.625
Order in the court.

39:09.627 --> 39:11.860
Please allow the witness
to speak his mind.

39:11.862 --> 39:13.729
Order in the court.

39:13.731 --> 39:15.964
Over there. Sir?

39:18.335 --> 39:20.602
I'd like to call for
a brief recess, Your Honor.

39:21.342 --> 39:23.939
Who would like to call
for a brief recess?

39:28.012 --> 39:31.013
I... the-the defense

39:31.015 --> 39:33.615
would like to call for
a brief recess, Your Honor.

39:33.617 --> 39:35.851
But your client is in the middle
of testifying.

39:35.853 --> 39:37.052
Please, Your Honor.

39:37.054 --> 39:39.454
A man's life is at stake here.

39:39.456 --> 39:41.356
I will allow a five minute recess.

39:41.358 --> 39:42.858
- Not a minute more.
- Obj...

39:42.860 --> 39:44.326
Stay in your seat, Counselor.

39:44.328 --> 39:46.864
Don't object. My name is Agent Kincaid.

39:46.866 --> 39:49.531
I'm with the Federal
Bureau of Investigation.

39:49.533 --> 39:52.167
Dr. Bull brought a woman
to our offices last night.

39:52.169 --> 39:53.669
She wanted to talk about this case,

39:53.671 --> 39:54.836
about her husband.

39:54.838 --> 39:55.937
Excuse me?

39:55.939 --> 39:57.973
She brought a box with her.

39:57.975 --> 39:59.975
Another ring, a bracelet,

39:59.977 --> 40:01.309
a Jewish star.

40:01.311 --> 40:05.113
She said he referred to those
things as his mementos.

40:05.115 --> 40:07.584
What the hell is going on here?

40:07.586 --> 40:09.017
Well, I won't bore you
with all the details,

40:09.019 --> 40:10.385
but at 6:30 this morning,

40:10.387 --> 40:12.154
the FBI picked up Wayne Norton

40:12.156 --> 40:14.782
for questioning, and ten
minutes into interrogation,

40:15.313 --> 40:17.106
he confessed.

40:17.418 --> 40:20.762
Your Honor, if I might ask with
the approval of the defense,

40:20.764 --> 40:22.998
that this hearing resume

40:23.000 --> 40:24.866
so I could address the court?

40:26.003 --> 40:27.569
Yes, uh, Your Honor.

40:27.571 --> 40:29.371
The defense has no objection.

40:29.373 --> 40:32.507
Gentlemen, I am
determined to bring these proceedings

40:32.509 --> 40:36.378
to a close and allow this jury
to do its job.

40:36.380 --> 40:38.680
With that sole admonition,

40:38.682 --> 40:39.848
court is back in session.

40:39.850 --> 40:41.083
Yes, Counselor.

40:41.673 --> 40:43.151
In light of new evidence

40:43.153 --> 40:45.320
brought to my attention by the FBI,

40:46.427 --> 40:48.198
the government would like
to make a motion

40:48.200 --> 40:51.159
to set aside the verdict
against Elliot Miles.
