WEBVTT

00:53.595 --> 00:55.764
I went to the pump,
and on turning around,

00:55.847 --> 00:57.849
I saw McDermott dragging Nancy
along the yard

00:58.558 --> 01:01.227
leading from the back kitchen
to the front kitchen...

01:12.989 --> 01:15.116
I have made you some tea.

01:15.200 --> 01:17.660
Just set the breakfast tray down
on the table.

01:25.960 --> 01:27.879
Mrs. Humphrey, can you hear me?

01:35.470 --> 01:37.722
I want you to swallow this.

01:43.937 --> 01:45.355
You are quite safe.

01:45.438 --> 01:48.066
You collapsed while carrying
my breakfast tray in.

01:48.858 --> 01:52.237
May I ask,
what has become of your hired help?

01:52.320 --> 01:56.866
I could not pay her.
I owe her three months' back wages.

01:56.950 --> 02:00.662
My husband took our money two days ago.
I do not know where he has gone.

02:02.497 --> 02:05.458
You must eat something.
You will feel stronger.

02:06.126 --> 02:09.420
There is nothing in the house
to eat, Dr. Jordan.

02:09.504 --> 02:11.881
Your breakfast was the last of it.

02:11.965 --> 02:14.175
I have not eaten since my husband left.

02:25.019 --> 02:26.271
Here we go.

02:26.855 --> 02:28.398
You are too kind.

02:29.899 --> 02:31.317
Thank you.

02:32.402 --> 02:36.030
To purchase all this food.
This is so good of you, Dr. Jordan.

02:36.656 --> 02:40.577
Think nothing of it.
I could not let you starve.

02:40.660 --> 02:45.582
I'm afraid it will come to that.
I am at the end of my resources.

02:45.665 --> 02:48.126
I will advance you
another two months' rent.

02:48.209 --> 02:50.795
That should be sufficient
to keep the wolves at bay,

02:51.588 --> 02:54.424
at least until you've had time
to consider your prospects.

03:21.868 --> 03:23.119
Hello, Dr. Jordan.

03:24.787 --> 03:26.039
Good morning, Grace.

03:30.293 --> 03:34.172
-What is that you're working on today?
-I am mending Miss Lydia's lace.

03:34.839 --> 03:39.427
She's careless about clothes and ought to
be told fine clothes do not grow on trees.

03:40.845 --> 03:44.057
I will put it down now that you're here.
It's a strain on the eyes.

03:48.186 --> 03:51.439
Sir, you are without any item today.

03:51.522 --> 03:52.607
Grace?

03:53.816 --> 03:55.610
Any apple or onion or beet.

03:56.527 --> 03:59.197
Yes, I have determined
upon a different plan.

03:59.280 --> 04:01.574
-What is that, sir?
-Have you had any dreams, Grace?

04:18.007 --> 04:21.719
I suppose I have.
Though none I can remember at the moment.

04:26.140 --> 04:29.018
I will try to remember, if it will
help with the trouble you're in.

04:31.229 --> 04:32.897
What makes you think
I'm in trouble, Grace?

04:32.981 --> 04:36.192
Those who have been in trouble
are alert to it in others, sir.

04:37.485 --> 04:38.945
That is a kind thought.

04:43.783 --> 04:48.663
Perhaps we can pick up where we left off
before we were interrupted yesterday.

04:48.746 --> 04:51.082
You were telling me about your friend
Mary Whitney.

04:52.083 --> 04:53.251
Of course.

04:53.876 --> 04:56.296
Mary was a person
of very democratic views.

04:56.379 --> 05:02.260
To prepare a house for guests
requires extra attention.

05:04.262 --> 05:08.599
If there is dust in the corner,
I expect one of you to notice it.

05:09.600 --> 05:14.981
Heads up, heads down.
A spider can spin a web overnight. Notice.

05:17.025 --> 05:19.193
There's no reason for this house
not to gleam.

05:20.445 --> 05:21.904
It just takes vigilance!

05:24.991 --> 05:28.244
She was a fun-loving girl and very bold
and mischievous in her speech.

05:28.328 --> 05:30.413
I put it down to her being
native-born Canadian

05:30.496 --> 05:32.874
as she did not have
very much respect for degree.

05:32.957 --> 05:36.419
It angers me that some people
have so much and others so little.

05:38.629 --> 05:40.715
I cannot see any divine plan in it.

05:40.798 --> 05:43.676
-Would the rebels have changed that?
-Of course they would have.

05:43.760 --> 05:45.219
William Lyon Mackenzie said,

05:45.303 --> 05:47.430
"To yourselves, therefore, Farmers,

05:47.513 --> 05:49.891
the eyes of the whole colonies
are fixed on you,

05:49.974 --> 05:53.436
for you are the only true nobility
that this country can boast of.

05:54.437 --> 05:58.941
Canadians! Do you love freedom?
I know you do.

05:59.025 --> 06:00.568
Do you hate oppression?

06:00.651 --> 06:02.070
Who dare deny it?"

06:04.322 --> 06:07.450
-It's very sad that the rebels lost.
-We didn't lose.

06:08.201 --> 06:09.368
We just haven't won yet.

06:10.119 --> 06:12.747
Do you know that my grandmother
was a Red Indian,

06:12.830 --> 06:14.707
which is why my hair is so dark.

06:14.791 --> 06:18.711
If I had half a chance,
I'd run away to the woods

06:18.795 --> 06:21.255
and go about with a bow and arrow.

06:21.964 --> 06:25.301
You could come with me; we wouldn't
have to pin up our hair or wear stays.

06:25.384 --> 06:27.386
How would we live?
How would we survive?

06:27.470 --> 06:33.309
We would hunt, of course.
And leap out and scalp passing travelers.

06:33.392 --> 06:36.270
It's in my blood to know how to.
And to be feared.

06:40.650 --> 06:42.110
...then the polishing.

06:42.193 --> 06:45.113
One dusts, one sweeps, then polishes.

06:45.196 --> 06:47.824
Please don't polish the dust.

06:47.907 --> 06:49.367
I can't smell the onions!

06:49.450 --> 06:51.994
If braised correctly,
I should be able to smell them.

06:52.078 --> 06:53.412
Please don't come here cutting corners.

06:53.496 --> 06:57.834
I'd like to scalp Mrs. Alderman Parkinson.
It wouldn't be worth the trouble, though.

06:57.917 --> 06:59.168
Her hair is not her own.

07:04.590 --> 07:07.009
It was just our way of talking,
no harm was meant.

07:07.969 --> 07:09.053
All right.

07:17.353 --> 07:20.356
You must take the peel off
in one long piece

07:20.440 --> 07:24.610
and then without looking behind you,
you must throw it over your left shoulder.

07:24.694 --> 07:27.113
And it will spell the initial of the man
you will marry.

07:28.030 --> 07:29.740
I'm too young to be thinking of husbands.

07:31.284 --> 07:33.953
You're never too young
to think of a husband.

07:34.036 --> 07:37.665
When I've saved up enough of my wages,
I'm going to marry a nice young farmer

07:37.748 --> 07:40.751
whose land is already cleared
and a good house built.

07:40.835 --> 07:43.671
I even know what kind of hens
and cow we will have.

07:43.754 --> 07:47.884
I want red and white Leghorns and
a Jersey cow for the cream and cheese.

07:47.967 --> 07:49.385
There's nothing better.

07:49.469 --> 07:52.638
And a cat named Tabby and a dog named Rex.

07:55.057 --> 07:57.518
Look! I got it off in one piece!

07:57.602 --> 07:59.061
All right.

08:03.107 --> 08:05.067
Who shall we marry?

08:08.779 --> 08:12.783
- There's no way to tell which way is up.
- Yes. There. Look.

08:12.867 --> 08:14.619
A "J."

08:14.702 --> 08:16.162
It's a "J."

08:17.455 --> 08:22.710
Grace! You will marry Jeremiah.
He's the peddler who's coming tomorrow.

08:22.793 --> 08:26.464
He is handsome, but you'll have to tramp
around the countryside

08:26.547 --> 08:29.967
and you won't have any house
but the pack you carry on your back.

08:30.801 --> 08:36.933
-Oh, Grace, I'm just having fun with you!
-Go on. It's your turn.

08:43.648 --> 08:44.857
I'll try another.

08:52.657 --> 08:54.742
Here. Take my extra one.

09:14.011 --> 09:16.180
It's just a foolish old wives' tale.

09:19.350 --> 09:22.228
Come.
Let's go to bed and make fun of people.

09:52.925 --> 09:54.510
Jeremiah, blow the fire.

09:54.594 --> 09:56.637
Puff, puff, puff!

09:56.721 --> 09:58.973
First you blow it gently...

09:59.056 --> 10:00.057
Who's that?

10:00.683 --> 10:02.935
Jeremiah, blow the fire...

10:03.019 --> 10:04.979
It is Jeremiah!

10:05.062 --> 10:08.482
Jeremiah, blow the fire, puff, puff, puff!

10:08.566 --> 10:12.570
First you blow it gently,
then you blow it rough!

10:12.653 --> 10:13.654
Rough!

10:13.738 --> 10:15.406
What is all this about, Jeremiah?

10:15.489 --> 10:20.328
Well, they used to pelt me with horse dung
and pillage my wares while I gave chase.

10:20.411 --> 10:22.788
I thought it best to have them follow
under my command

10:22.872 --> 10:24.206
so I've chosen the wiser course,

10:24.290 --> 10:27.335
which is to teach them the song
and simply pay the little tyrants.

10:27.418 --> 10:29.795
There you are, share it.
It's for all of you!

10:30.421 --> 10:31.756
Come. What have you brought us!

10:31.839 --> 10:34.300
We need to make a new woman
of our Grace here.

10:36.719 --> 10:37.970
Come, let's all go inside.

10:38.679 --> 10:39.805
Come along.

10:48.439 --> 10:50.107
Look at these earrings.

10:50.191 --> 10:53.027
Don't look too long.
The gold and silver will rub off.

10:53.110 --> 10:54.987
-Now, Mary.
-You know it to be true.

10:55.071 --> 10:57.073
-I'll buy some.
-You scarcely need it.

10:57.156 --> 11:00.201
-You smell like a princess already.
-Onions more like.

11:00.284 --> 11:02.912
-Then you smell good enough to eat.
-Well, Jeremiah.

11:02.995 --> 11:06.415
I see you're up to your old pranks.
Taking advantage of the women again.

11:06.499 --> 11:09.001
Mrs. Honey, as always
you are absolutely correct.

11:09.085 --> 11:11.504
That is exactly what I am trying to do.

11:11.587 --> 11:15.091
How can I resist with so many pretty girls
about, though none as pretty as yourself.

11:15.174 --> 11:16.717
Oh, be quiet.

11:17.676 --> 11:20.763
Look at these handkerchiefs.
I'll take two of those.

11:20.846 --> 11:23.766
Now be brisk about your business
and don't take all day.

11:23.849 --> 11:25.351
These girls have their work to do.

11:25.893 --> 11:28.229
-Tell us our fortunes, Jeremiah!
-Come on!

11:28.312 --> 11:30.648
-Yes! Do!
-No. It is meddling with the Devil.

11:30.731 --> 11:32.024
Do tricks! Please!

11:32.108 --> 11:35.194
He used to work at fairs.
He knows conjuring tricks.

11:40.032 --> 11:41.951
--No!

11:43.619 --> 11:44.870
How did you do that?

11:44.954 --> 11:48.416
Before I was an honest tradesman, I lived
a wicked youth and had my pocket picked

11:48.499 --> 11:53.796
and my heart broken 50 times over
by cruel and pretty girls just like you.

11:53.879 --> 11:56.465
-I must be on my way.
-Oh, now, Jeremiah.

11:56.549 --> 11:59.093
Cook, there is no match for your cake.

12:00.886 --> 12:02.513
Girls, come on.

12:04.807 --> 12:05.891
Grace.

12:09.478 --> 12:12.481
You only bought four buttons.
Five for luck.

12:23.617 --> 12:25.244
There are sharp rocks ahead.

12:25.327 --> 12:27.288
I suppose there always are, sir.

12:27.371 --> 12:29.915
There have certainly been enough behind
so I'm not too daunted.

12:29.999 --> 12:31.292
A disaster.

12:37.089 --> 12:38.924
You will cross water three times.

12:39.008 --> 12:43.554
You will have much trouble.
But all will be fine in the end.

12:46.265 --> 12:47.892
You are one of us.

12:50.853 --> 12:54.315
Jeremiah. Mary, Grace. Come along.

13:02.907 --> 13:04.074
Well, Miss Grace.

13:04.158 --> 13:06.952
What a difference
now that you're decently dressed.

13:22.676 --> 13:23.761
Grace.

13:28.516 --> 13:32.061
If you need to go to the privy outside,
wait until it is light.

13:32.144 --> 13:34.897
-Why?
-It is not safe.

14:05.094 --> 14:10.349
Grace, you are too naive.
You mustn't go out alone at night.

14:10.975 --> 14:13.394
Why would you not be allowed
to go to the privy at night?

14:14.853 --> 14:18.566
Because a girl should not ever let
her guard down, Mary taught me that.

14:19.775 --> 14:21.193
So did the world, I suppose.

14:21.944 --> 14:23.529
Did you always feel that, Grace?

14:23.612 --> 14:25.990
Did you feel it more so after the murders?

14:40.838 --> 14:43.257
Hush, child.
You will wake the whole house.

14:43.340 --> 14:46.385
Look at me, Mary. I'll surely die.

14:46.468 --> 14:50.514
This is why I had to go to the privy.
I felt a pain in my stomach.

14:50.598 --> 14:53.684
This is how it began with my mother
when she died!

14:53.767 --> 14:56.770
Grace. You are a woman now.

14:57.479 --> 15:02.860
Oh, hush. It is all right.
It is perfectly normal.

15:02.943 --> 15:06.196
It happens once a month from now on.

15:07.781 --> 15:09.491
You'll be just fine.

15:11.118 --> 15:12.119
Here.

15:13.913 --> 15:17.291
You can put this on until you get
a red petticoat of your own.

15:17.833 --> 15:20.085
Here, I'll show you how it is done.

15:20.628 --> 15:23.672
Some call this "Eve's curse,"
but I think that is stupid

15:23.756 --> 15:27.051
because the real curse of Eve was having
to put up with the nonsense of Adam.

15:27.968 --> 15:29.303
There.

15:29.386 --> 15:32.973
If the pain gets too bad, I will get you
some willow bark to chew.

15:33.057 --> 15:35.267
I will go heat a brick for the ache.

15:35.351 --> 15:38.854
I'm so grateful for you.
You're a good and kind friend.

15:42.107 --> 15:46.862
You will be a beauty, Grace.
Soon you'll start to turn men's heads.

15:47.488 --> 15:49.281
The worst will be the gentlemen.

15:49.365 --> 15:51.700
Because they think they're entitled
to anything they want.

15:52.409 --> 15:55.955
They'll start promising you things,
they'll say, "I'll do whatever you want,"

15:56.038 --> 15:58.707
but you must be very careful
and never do anything for them

15:58.791 --> 16:01.168
unless they have performed
what they have promised.

16:01.251 --> 16:03.837
And if there's a ring,
a parson must go with it.

16:04.588 --> 16:06.298
Why is that?

16:07.800 --> 16:10.386
Because men are liars by nature, Grace.

16:13.305 --> 16:16.433
They'll say anything to get
what they want out of you

16:17.476 --> 16:20.646
then think better of it
and be off on the next boat.

16:20.729 --> 16:22.231
You're right.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.733
You're a good girl, Grace Marks.

17:45.439 --> 17:48.317
-What do you say to it, Grace?
-Why yes, sir.

17:48.400 --> 17:51.028
No one can make a person feel
at home like Mary can.

17:53.655 --> 17:54.656
Mary?

17:56.575 --> 18:00.412
George is the eldest son of the household.
He's just home for Christmas.

18:01.497 --> 18:03.207
-Mary?
-Grace.

18:44.665 --> 18:47.251
You used the ribbon you bought
from Jeremiah!

18:47.334 --> 18:49.753
You should have saved it for yourself!

18:51.463 --> 18:55.717
This is the best needle case in the world.
I've never seen anything like it.

18:56.426 --> 18:58.262
I will cherish it always.

18:58.345 --> 19:00.180
Go on. Open yours.

19:10.274 --> 19:11.525
It's beautiful.

19:11.608 --> 19:15.404
It was my mother's.
She gave it to me just before she died.

19:16.113 --> 19:17.656
-You mustn't part with it.
-No.

19:17.739 --> 19:21.618
You are my dearest friend
and I want you to have it.

19:27.082 --> 19:28.584
I'm not a stranger
to Plato myself.

19:32.004 --> 19:35.924
...'cause I found a new farmer
who fattens his geese.

19:49.980 --> 19:54.568
Mary, I have the most horrible tear in
the dress I was wearing this morning.

19:54.651 --> 19:57.487
You are the most
talented seamstress I know.

19:57.571 --> 20:00.324
-Will you look at it tonight?
-Yes, of course, ma'am.

20:02.576 --> 20:03.410
Right away.

20:15.881 --> 20:18.091
♪ Now bring us some figgy pudding ♪

20:18.175 --> 20:20.427
♪ Now bring us some figgy pudding ♪

20:20.510 --> 20:22.638
♪ Now bring us some figgy pudding ♪

20:22.721 --> 20:24.473
♪ And bring it right now ♪

20:24.556 --> 20:27.059
♪ We won't go until we get some ♪

20:27.142 --> 20:29.311
♪ We won't go until we get some ♪

20:29.394 --> 20:31.396
♪ We won't go until we get some ♪

20:31.480 --> 20:33.941
♪ So bring it right here! ♪

20:41.073 --> 20:44.618
That was the happiest Christmas
I'd ever spent, either before or after.

20:47.329 --> 20:50.457
Mr. George stayed at home after Christmas.
He'd caught a chill.

20:55.045 --> 20:59.341
This is the best thing for the lumbago
if you put it on the spot.

20:59.424 --> 21:00.968
I'll take it to him.

21:01.051 --> 21:03.512
Mrs. Parkinson wants him
to be alone to rest.

21:03.595 --> 21:04.888
I will take it to him.

21:06.974 --> 21:09.184
By the time he was better,
it was February,

21:09.893 --> 21:11.770
and he'd missed
so much of the college term,

21:11.853 --> 21:14.147
he said he would stay until the next one.

21:14.231 --> 21:18.443
And so there he was, being fussed over
by all, and with time on his hands

21:18.527 --> 21:22.656
and not much to do, which is a bad
situation for a man full of spirits.

21:22.739 --> 21:26.034
I'm afraid he was very much indulged,
not least by himself.

21:26.785 --> 21:29.913
For if the world treats you well, sir, you
come to believe you're deserving of it.

21:30.706 --> 21:31.707
George.

21:34.293 --> 21:37.129
I won't have you fraternizing
with the servants

21:37.212 --> 21:40.424
when you're here to rest and recover.

21:40.507 --> 21:43.010
-Mother, I'm not that ill anymore.
-Have some tea.

21:45.762 --> 21:46.763
Mary.

21:49.308 --> 21:50.559
Mary. Slow down.

21:50.642 --> 21:52.436
-I'm in a hurry.
-Why?

21:55.397 --> 21:57.149
Be careful when passing underneath.

21:57.232 --> 22:00.068
I heard of a woman who was killed
by an icicle once.

22:00.152 --> 22:01.945
It went right through her like a skewer.

22:10.704 --> 22:12.998
About this time, I began
to notice a change in Mary.

22:16.084 --> 22:19.004
Where were you tonight?
I missed our talking.

22:19.755 --> 22:24.301
I am tired, Grace.
I must go right to sleep.

22:44.488 --> 22:45.947
Are they going skating?

22:48.116 --> 22:49.576
Have you ever been skating?

22:50.786 --> 22:52.037
No.

23:04.466 --> 23:08.512
-Come on. Come and get me, Mary.
-There is much to be done, Grace.

23:12.224 --> 23:13.850
Is there some trouble, Mary?

23:15.352 --> 23:17.646
I do not know where you are
getting such ideas.

23:23.485 --> 23:25.112
You need to lie down.

23:25.195 --> 23:26.738
Nonsense.

23:26.822 --> 23:30.408
It was yesterday's mutton stew
and now I am rid of it.

23:31.409 --> 23:34.037
I had the same thing myself
and I feel perfectly well.

23:34.121 --> 23:36.164
Do not mention it again, please.

23:37.457 --> 23:38.667
All right.

23:57.644 --> 23:58.687
Oh, sweet Mary.

23:59.980 --> 24:02.399
I believe you are in great need
of confiding in someone.

24:03.525 --> 24:06.319
I saw my own mother
in this condition very often.

24:09.197 --> 24:11.449
He promised to marry me.

24:15.704 --> 24:21.877
And he gave me a ring,
and for once I wanted to believe him.

24:22.878 --> 24:24.963
I thought he wasn't like other men.

24:25.922 --> 24:29.551
But now he's gone back on his promise
and he would not even speak with me.

24:30.510 --> 24:34.181
-I don't know what to do.
-Who, Mary?

24:45.108 --> 24:46.818
I cannot say.

24:50.363 --> 24:53.950
But as soon as anyone knows what sort
of trouble I'm in, I'll be turned away.

24:55.243 --> 24:58.580
And then what will become of me?
I'll have to go to the streets

24:58.663 --> 25:02.709
and become a sailor's drab
to feed myself and the baby.

25:03.960 --> 25:06.838
That kind of life will be
the end of me soon.

25:11.426 --> 25:16.681
Mary, you are the truest friend I have.
I'll do anything for you.

25:16.765 --> 25:18.141
What can I do?

25:18.225 --> 25:22.020
There must be a workhouse or something
of the sort that will take you in.

25:23.188 --> 25:26.066
Young girls always die
in those sorts of places.

25:26.983 --> 25:29.277
They catch a fever as soon
as they are delivered

25:29.945 --> 25:34.574
and they secretly smother the babies so
as not to be a charge on the public purse.

25:36.368 --> 25:39.371
I'd rather take my chances
of dying elsewhere.

25:41.957 --> 25:43.959
What if I were to deliver it?

25:44.834 --> 25:47.170
I helped with my sister's
and brother's births.

25:47.796 --> 25:50.131
Then we could secretly give it away.
Maybe nobody would know.

25:50.215 --> 25:53.426
My condition will soon start to show.

25:54.469 --> 25:58.014
Mrs. Honey and Mrs. Parkinson
have such sharp eyes.

26:07.107 --> 26:12.153
You must try one last time
to speak with the man in question.

26:12.862 --> 26:14.656
Appeal to his better nature.

26:15.740 --> 26:18.660
He cannot turn you away
if he has any decency at all.

26:48.690 --> 26:51.860
-Where is Mary?
-She's just in the privy.

26:51.943 --> 26:54.571
Probably eating.
She is certainly putting on flesh.

26:54.654 --> 26:57.198
That girl will eat us
out of house and home.

27:16.468 --> 27:17.886
He gave me five dollars.

27:18.595 --> 27:22.515
Five dollars!
That is what his child is worth to him.

27:22.599 --> 27:24.851
He said I would not catch him this way.

27:25.852 --> 27:32.025
He said he doubted the child is even his
since I've been so obliging with him,

27:32.108 --> 27:35.070
and if I threaten him
with a scandal, he'll deny it

27:35.862 --> 27:38.573
and ruin whatever reputation I have left.

27:41.076 --> 27:43.703
He said if I wanted a quick end
to my troubles,

27:44.496 --> 27:47.791
I should just go and drown myself.

28:01.054 --> 28:03.223
I loved him.

28:06.017 --> 28:09.813
I... I truly loved him.

28:19.697 --> 28:21.699
I don't any longer.

28:25.412 --> 28:26.663
Where are we going, Mary?

28:26.746 --> 28:30.041
There's a doctor here who helps whores
when they need it.

28:31.167 --> 28:34.629
-In what way might he help you?
-You shouldn't ask.

28:35.755 --> 28:37.424
I've never heard of such doctors.

28:37.507 --> 28:40.552
Are you sure, Grace?
About lending me your savings?

28:40.635 --> 28:42.387
Of course. With all my heart.

28:54.441 --> 28:56.276
Soon I may be dead.

28:57.193 --> 28:59.195
But you'll still be alive.

29:00.196 --> 29:02.407
Don't go. Don't go to this doctor.

29:02.490 --> 29:05.326
I must. Don't carry on, Grace.

29:21.176 --> 29:22.719
Come inside, quickly.

29:36.524 --> 29:38.318
You wait here.

29:38.401 --> 29:41.112
If you ever tell about this,
I will deny having seen you.

29:42.322 --> 29:44.574
-Go, Grace. Grace, go!
-No.

30:15.605 --> 30:16.940
Mary!

30:18.316 --> 30:19.567
Mary!

30:21.194 --> 30:22.278
Mary!

30:52.141 --> 30:53.393
What happened?

30:54.769 --> 30:58.147
He took a knife to me
and he cut something inside.

30:59.357 --> 31:03.403
He said there will be pain and bleeding,
but after that all will be right again.

31:03.945 --> 31:05.405
He didn't...

31:05.488 --> 31:09.367
Grace, you must go back to work
or we will be noticed.

31:10.702 --> 31:13.538
Say that I have just gone
to fetch something.

31:14.330 --> 31:15.748
I can't leave you.

31:15.832 --> 31:17.333
Grace, you must.

31:18.418 --> 31:20.378
I cannot be found out.

31:41.566 --> 31:44.444
I can see you think
it is a most wicked thing.

31:45.194 --> 31:47.780
The thing he had cut out was,
of course, her baby.

31:48.781 --> 31:50.909
I thought it was
a most wicked thing myself.

31:52.952 --> 31:56.247
But I also thought it was either
one corpse that way or two the other,

31:57.290 --> 31:59.876
for if not she would have certainly
drowned herself.

32:00.710 --> 32:03.713
So I could not find it within my heart
to reproach her.

32:17.226 --> 32:19.312
Let me fetch someone.
You are in such pain.

32:20.355 --> 32:25.234
No, Grace, you must not.
It will be the end of me if you do.

32:25.318 --> 32:30.073
I will sleep on the floor tonight
so you can be more comfortable.

32:31.574 --> 32:33.743
- Grace.
- Yes?

32:33.826 --> 32:35.662
I am angry.

32:35.745 --> 32:38.331
I am so very angry.

32:41.250 --> 32:43.086
Grace, tell me a story.

32:44.879 --> 32:47.173
The only good stories
are the ones you've told me.

32:47.256 --> 32:48.841
Tell me one of those, then.

32:50.760 --> 32:53.930
Tell me about
William Lyon Mackenzie's escape.

32:58.518 --> 33:03.398
William Lyon Mackenzie was a great man
who led the rebellion here.

33:04.565 --> 33:06.526
After the rebellion was lost

33:06.609 --> 33:09.320
and Montgomery's Tavern
was burned to the ground,

33:09.404 --> 33:12.198
he made his way towards the United States.

33:12.281 --> 33:17.370
Many, many people hid him
and protected him in their farm houses

33:17.453 --> 33:19.706
and kept their mouths shut
when they saw him

33:19.789 --> 33:21.958
because Canadians
want liberty and freedom.

33:22.041 --> 33:24.419
They don't have it yet,
but one day they will.

33:25.253 --> 33:29.507
Because we didn't lose,
we just haven't won yet.

33:30.925 --> 33:33.428
Say the speech that I taught you.

33:35.471 --> 33:40.184
"The law says that we shall not be taxed

33:40.268 --> 33:42.979
without our consent
by the men of our choice,

33:43.813 --> 33:49.068
but a wicked and tyrannical government
has trampled upon that law,

33:49.152 --> 33:54.699
divided the plunder, and declared that,
regardless of justice,

33:54.782 --> 33:58.453
they will continue to roll
in their splendid carriages

33:58.536 --> 34:02.165
and riot in their palaces at our expense,

34:02.790 --> 34:07.336
that we are poor, spiritless,
ignorant peasants,

34:07.420 --> 34:10.173
who were born to toil for our betters.

34:10.256 --> 34:15.553
But the peasants are beginning to open
their eyes and feel their strength.

34:16.512 --> 34:20.850
Too long have we been hoodwinked
by Baal's priests,

34:20.933 --> 34:24.312
who take the wages of sin
and do the work of iniquity,

34:24.395 --> 34:26.939
each one looking to gain in his quarter.

34:27.982 --> 34:32.111
Canadians! Do you love freedom?

34:32.195 --> 34:33.613
I know you do.

34:34.530 --> 34:36.032
Do you hate oppression?

34:36.115 --> 34:37.950
Who dare deny it?"

35:29.710 --> 35:32.171
Grace! Mary! You're late!

35:32.255 --> 35:34.465
Wake up! Mrs. Parkinson is angry!

35:43.724 --> 35:44.934
Mary.

35:47.270 --> 35:48.479
Good heavens.

35:49.897 --> 35:51.816
She is dead.

36:03.661 --> 36:05.580
This is a bad business.

36:06.372 --> 36:07.999
You stay here.

36:23.931 --> 36:24.974
Mary.

36:27.560 --> 36:29.395
Are you pretending?

36:43.034 --> 36:44.827
An outrage and a disgrace.

36:44.911 --> 36:47.830
- What a terrible smell.
- Smells like a butcher shop.

36:55.963 --> 36:57.882
Under my own roof.

36:59.800 --> 37:01.427
What a deceitful girl.

37:04.013 --> 37:06.265
Grace, why did you not inform me of this?

37:07.266 --> 37:10.561
Please, ma'am, Mary told me not to.

37:10.645 --> 37:14.065
She said she'd be better in the morning.
I did not know she was going to die!

37:14.148 --> 37:16.984
That was very wicked of you, Grace.
Who was the man?

37:17.068 --> 37:20.321
The scoundrel ought to be exposed
and made to pay for his crime.

37:20.404 --> 37:21.948
Do you know, Grace?

37:22.031 --> 37:24.492
She was seeing a gentleman
and they were engaged.

37:24.575 --> 37:26.953
Only he broke his promise
and would not marry her.

37:27.745 --> 37:30.206
-What gentleman?
-Please, ma'am, I don't know.

37:31.624 --> 37:34.627
Only she said you would not like it
if you found out who it was.

37:38.214 --> 37:40.091
We will not discuss this any further

37:41.175 --> 37:45.263
as it will only bring misery, and there's
no sense crying over spilt milk.

37:47.056 --> 37:50.309
Out of respect to the dead,
we will not say how Mary died.

37:50.393 --> 37:55.564
We will say it was a low fever.
That will be best for all.

37:59.527 --> 38:02.363
All the time Mary
was there on the bed, listening.

38:03.739 --> 38:07.201
She was hearing our plans
to tell these lies about her.

38:08.119 --> 38:10.579
I thought she will not be easy
in her mind about it.

38:11.914 --> 38:14.375
It was the doctor that killed her
with his knife,

38:14.458 --> 38:16.335
him and the gentleman between them.

38:16.419 --> 38:19.422
For it is not always the one who strikes
that is the actual murderer.

38:21.632 --> 38:24.093
Mary was done to death
by that unknown gentleman,

38:24.593 --> 38:28.139
as surely as if he'd taken the knife
and plunged it into her body himself.

38:45.740 --> 38:48.200
Now clean this up.
Grace, get yourself dressed.

38:49.076 --> 38:54.707
Girls, do not speak of Mary's death until
we have her looking more respectable.

38:58.336 --> 39:01.630
Take the sheet from the bed
and her nightdress and petticoat

39:01.714 --> 39:03.215
and wash the blood out.

39:04.008 --> 39:06.802
Wash the body
and take the mattress to be burnt.

39:07.511 --> 39:09.347
Is there another nightdress?

39:10.639 --> 39:12.391
I will give her mine.

39:16.896 --> 39:19.482
There is more to this than meets the eye.

39:23.110 --> 39:24.987
I wonder who the man is.

39:25.071 --> 39:27.948
Whoever he is, he's likely enjoying
his breakfast at this moment

39:28.032 --> 39:31.327
and not thinking about poor Mary,
no more than a carcass at the butcher's.

39:31.911 --> 39:35.956
-It is the curse of Eve we must all bear.
-Mary would have laughed at that.

39:45.007 --> 39:46.717
Let me in.

39:50.971 --> 39:53.182
What are you doing?
It's cold as an icicle out there.

39:53.265 --> 39:54.558
The smell is making me sick.

39:54.642 --> 39:57.978
It's true. We should air out the room.

39:59.772 --> 40:01.190
I hope it's not too late.

40:01.774 --> 40:03.025
Too late for what, Grace?

40:04.193 --> 40:05.820
For her soul to be let out.

40:19.208 --> 40:22.461
I realized I forgot to open
a window to let her soul out.

40:22.962 --> 40:24.505
I must have heard wrong.

40:24.588 --> 40:27.758
I thought I heard her say, "Let me in."

40:27.842 --> 40:30.845
But she must have said, "Let me out."

40:49.613 --> 40:51.073
Grace.

40:51.157 --> 40:52.783
Grace, wake up.

40:52.867 --> 40:54.160
Now wake up.

40:55.494 --> 40:57.079
Grace dear, please.

40:57.163 --> 40:58.831
Grace.

40:58.914 --> 41:00.624
Grace, it's time to wake up now.

41:09.216 --> 41:10.551
Grace.

41:18.142 --> 41:19.685
- Grace.

Where am I?

42:04.104 --> 42:07.608
You're here, Grace.
You're in Mary's room.

42:09.318 --> 42:11.946
-Where is Grace?
-You are Grace, my dear.

42:12.029 --> 42:15.366
Grace. Your Mary has died.

42:15.991 --> 42:17.535
You've had a terrible shock.

42:18.494 --> 42:20.329
Where's Grace?

42:21.038 --> 42:22.998
What's happened?! Where is Grace?!

42:23.082 --> 42:26.001
You are Grace. You are Grace.
Mary has died.

42:26.085 --> 42:28.796
No. No! She is lost!
I must search for her.

42:28.879 --> 42:31.048
Oh, my dear,
I fear you've had a terrible shock.

42:31.131 --> 42:33.551
And it's no wonder
considering the shock of it.

42:33.634 --> 42:35.553
No, Grace is lost! I must find her.

42:35.636 --> 42:39.098
Grace, Mary has died. Mary has died.
You are with us and you are all right.

42:57.449 --> 42:59.910
When I woke again,
it was a day later,

42:59.994 --> 43:03.247
and I knew again that I was Grace,
and that Mary was dead.

43:03.998 --> 43:07.251
And I remembered the night we'd thrown
the apple peelings over our shoulders

43:07.334 --> 43:11.505
and Mary's had broken three times,
and now it had all come true,

43:11.589 --> 43:14.550
as she had not married anyone,
and now never would.

43:15.551 --> 43:18.095
But I had no memory of anything
I said or did

43:18.178 --> 43:21.140
during the time I was awake
between the two long sleeps.

43:21.223 --> 43:23.434
-No memory at all?
-No.

43:24.226 --> 43:25.603
And this worried me.

43:57.926 --> 44:00.888
And so the happiest time of my life
was over and gone.

44:01.972 --> 44:04.892
-Not now. Please!
-I believe it is Miss Lydia.

44:09.063 --> 44:11.398
I just wanted to make sure
you don't need anything.

44:11.482 --> 44:13.901
No. No, we don't need anything.
Please close the door.

44:20.199 --> 44:23.702
I'll need to hem that skirt.
It will drag through mud in this weather.

44:23.786 --> 44:25.829
-Grace--
-I'll be done this quilt in a week

44:25.913 --> 44:27.414
if our sessions are this long.

44:30.042 --> 44:31.335
Thank you, Grace.

44:44.098 --> 44:46.809
It is knowledge of me you crave, Doctor.

44:54.233 --> 44:55.609
Forbidden knowledge.

45:01.323 --> 45:03.367
Knowledge with a lurid glare to it.

45:06.912 --> 45:09.790
Knowledge gained
through a descent into the pit.

45:29.518 --> 45:31.770
You want to go where I can never go.

45:32.479 --> 45:35.524
See what I can never see inside me.

45:36.525 --> 45:39.695
You want to open up my body
and peer inside.

45:41.738 --> 45:46.785
In your hand, you want to hold
my beating female heart.
