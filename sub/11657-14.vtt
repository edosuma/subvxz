01:03.533 --> 01:06.433
"Who was known as the world's
fastest human being?"

01:06.500 --> 01:08.166
Dominic Tansey.

01:08.233 --> 01:10.433
It says Jesse Owens here.

01:10.500 --> 01:12.734
Trust me,
it was Dominic Tansey.

01:12.800 --> 01:14.867
He got four women pregnant
in one night.

01:16.467 --> 01:18.900
Two in New York,
two in new Jersey.

01:20.166 --> 01:22.066
Girls, I am so excited.

01:22.133 --> 01:23.333
I am finally going to do something

01:23.400 --> 01:24.934
you've heard me talk about doing
for years.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.834
You decided to install
a trapeze over your bed.

01:29.867 --> 01:32.867
No. Actually,
I'm talking about this car.

01:32.934 --> 01:36.066
Oh, Blanche, it's beautiful!

01:36.133 --> 01:37.767
Can you afford a car like this?

01:37.834 --> 01:39.834
Only if I can unload my old one.

01:39.900 --> 01:42.934
Oh, that won't be any problem.
That's a wonderful car.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.367
Rose, you need a car.
Why don't you buy it?

01:45.433 --> 01:47.133
No, no, I couldn't
sell my car to Rose.

01:47.200 --> 01:50.066
She's my friend. My great
granddaddy always used to say

01:50.133 --> 01:53.100
there are two things you never sell
to a friend, a car and a sleigh.

01:53.166 --> 01:54.867
'Cause if either one of them
quits working,

01:54.934 --> 01:56.834
you'll never hear the end of it.

01:57.700 --> 01:59.700
'Course, they hanged
my great granddaddy.

02:00.300 --> 02:02.467
He said a lot of things
he shouldn't have.

02:02.533 --> 02:03.900
What'll you give me for it?

02:03.967 --> 02:08.033
Oh, I couldn't buy your car.
It's not my type.

02:08.100 --> 02:10.967
I want a car that says "practical."

02:11.900 --> 02:14.667
Your car says "available."

02:16.867 --> 02:19.133
Well, just take off
my personalized plates.

02:20.367 --> 02:23.333
Rose, I tell you what,
take the car for two weeks.

02:23.400 --> 02:25.033
-Oh...
-Yeah, just try it out.

02:25.100 --> 02:27.467
If you don't absolutely love it,
I'll take it back.

02:27.533 --> 02:29.834
-Well...
-No questions asked.

02:32.100 --> 02:35.066
What the heck. You only live once.
Might as well be daring.

02:35.133 --> 02:36.867
Rose, it's a used car.

02:36.934 --> 02:38.533
It's not a seat
on the space shuttle.

02:39.600 --> 02:41.567
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello.

02:41.633 --> 02:43.600
Blanche, I need you
to give me a manicure.

02:43.667 --> 02:45.400
Rose, I need you
to lend me your pearls.

02:45.467 --> 02:48.033
Ma, I need you
to stay off my back.

02:48.100 --> 02:49.633
What? What'd I do?

02:49.700 --> 02:53.734
I am going out with a new man tonight,
and he is not Italian.

02:53.800 --> 02:54.900
Oh, who is he, Dorothy?

02:54.967 --> 02:57.400
Oh, his name is Glen O'Brien.

02:57.467 --> 02:59.533
-Where'd you meet him?
-His name is O'brien.

02:59.600 --> 03:01.300
Two to one,
she met him at a gin mill.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.533
No, he's a teacher at the school
where I've been subbing.

03:05.600 --> 03:08.233
A gorgeous gym teacher.

03:08.300 --> 03:09.700
Ooh.

03:11.734 --> 03:14.467
I noticed him a few times
and today, as luck would have it,

03:14.533 --> 03:18.567
I found myself right behind him
in the line in the cafeteria.

03:18.633 --> 03:21.867
After I butted ahead of 25 students.

03:21.934 --> 03:26.800
Anyway, we started talking,
and in 30 seconds, I was in love.

03:26.867 --> 03:28.200
And he asked you out?

03:28.266 --> 03:29.767
Yes! We're going out
to dinner tonight.

03:29.834 --> 03:32.033
I cannot believe
how excited I am!

03:32.100 --> 03:35.500
I mean, he's practically a stranger,
and I'm crazy about him.

03:35.567 --> 03:38.467
I haven't felt this way
about a man ever before.

03:38.533 --> 03:41.200
Oh, honey, you've been hit
by the thunderbolt.

03:41.266 --> 03:43.200
Love at first sight.

03:43.266 --> 03:45.133
-It happened to me once.
-Once?

03:45.200 --> 03:48.233
You've been hit by more lightning
than the world trade center.

03:49.600 --> 03:51.967
I was hit by the thunderbolt once.

03:52.033 --> 03:54.233
Probably a direct hit
to the forehead.

03:55.600 --> 03:57.934
It was the first time
I saw my Charlie.

03:59.200 --> 04:01.400
I was seven, and he was eight.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.200
It was a hot Minnesota summer,

04:10.266 --> 04:13.133
and he had put up one of those
little stands on the sidewalk.

04:13.200 --> 04:14.533
Selling lemonade.

04:14.600 --> 04:15.800
Insurance.

04:17.533 --> 04:21.600
And I bought a nickel policy
on my red wagon.

04:22.300 --> 04:24.867
And right after that,
my wagon was destroyed.

04:24.934 --> 04:26.433
How?

04:26.500 --> 04:28.266
Some hogs trampled it.

04:29.900 --> 04:32.533
I was hauling home
a smoked ham for mama,

04:32.600 --> 04:34.266
and I think it set them off.

04:35.166 --> 04:37.433
Well, anyway, that's when
I fell in love with Charlie.

04:38.367 --> 04:40.300
He paid for a new wagon,

04:40.367 --> 04:43.300
even though my policy
didn't cover acts of swine.

04:51.033 --> 04:52.967
"Acts of swine."

05:02.667 --> 05:05.367
-It's amazing.
-What's amazing?

05:05.433 --> 05:06.900
Oh, I don't know.

05:06.967 --> 05:09.033
-A lot of things.
-Like?

05:09.100 --> 05:11.700
-Like you.
-Hardly.

05:11.767 --> 05:14.333
-Like me.
-Definitely.

05:14.400 --> 05:16.066
Like us.

05:16.133 --> 05:18.600
These past three weeks
have been amazing.

05:20.100 --> 05:21.867
They have been
pretty amazing.

05:22.433 --> 05:26.333
It's amazing that I just made love
in the daylight.

05:27.734 --> 05:29.667
(chuckles)

05:29.734 --> 05:31.533
Why is that amazing?

05:31.600 --> 05:34.533
Well, you can't hide anything
in the daytime.

05:34.600 --> 05:37.300
At night, I could be Godzilla,
you'd be thrilled.

05:39.066 --> 05:42.800
I'm thrilled, period.
Everything about you thrills me.

05:42.867 --> 05:44.667
And that's amazing.

05:44.734 --> 05:46.200
Every time you tell me you love me,

05:46.266 --> 05:50.333
I turn around to see who you're
talking to. I can't believe it.

05:50.400 --> 05:52.734
Believe it. I love you.

05:52.800 --> 05:55.133
And everything that I used
to worry about in...

05:56.467 --> 05:57.367
you know...

05:58.367 --> 06:00.033
I didn't worry about with you.

06:00.567 --> 06:02.600
-Like?
-Like...

06:03.633 --> 06:08.600
like, how do I look?
How do I sound?

06:08.667 --> 06:10.400
Is my breath bad?

06:12.200 --> 06:13.633
What's jiggling?

06:15.900 --> 06:17.200
Well, let's see.

06:24.266 --> 06:28.066
Oh, and you,
you are amazing.

06:28.133 --> 06:33.800
You are warm and loving and caring
and smart and funny,

06:33.867 --> 06:36.900
and I don't have to wear flats
when I go out with you.

06:39.166 --> 06:41.967
I have an idea.
Let's cut school tomorrow

06:42.033 --> 06:44.433
and go to the Bahamas
and not leave our hotel room

06:44.500 --> 06:46.533
until the board of health
threatens us.

06:48.400 --> 06:49.367
I can't do it.

06:49.433 --> 06:51.433
Forget the Bahamas.
How about dinner?

06:53.066 --> 06:54.633
Dorothy, listen.

06:56.233 --> 06:57.200
What?

07:00.200 --> 07:03.000
-I have to tell you something.
-What?

07:03.066 --> 07:04.600
What, what, what?

07:05.700 --> 07:06.800
Oh, boy.

07:07.867 --> 07:09.200
Oh, God.

07:11.433 --> 07:12.734
I'm married.

07:17.266 --> 07:18.233
What?

07:18.300 --> 07:21.367
It's not a good marriage,
Dorothy. It was over years ago.

07:23.667 --> 07:27.100
I can't believe this.
You lied to me.

07:27.166 --> 07:29.867
No, I didn't lie.
I'm telling you now.

07:30.967 --> 07:32.100
I'm getting out of here.

07:32.166 --> 07:33.467
-No!
-Let go of me.

07:33.533 --> 07:35.767
No, you gotta listen.
Please, you have to listen to me.

07:35.834 --> 07:37.567
Listen? Listen to what?
Listen to what?

07:37.633 --> 07:39.200
How your wife doesn't
understand you?

07:39.266 --> 07:41.633
How you stayed
because of the children?

07:41.700 --> 07:43.400
I did stay for the children.

07:43.467 --> 07:45.633
My wife would've moved them
back to her home.

07:45.700 --> 07:47.567
My kids would've been
clear across the country.

07:47.633 --> 07:49.233
I couldn't bear to lose them,
so I stayed.

07:49.300 --> 07:53.233
Your children are over 30.
You're still staying for them?

07:53.300 --> 07:55.133
I couldn't leave her
because of all the things--

07:55.200 --> 07:56.967
Oh, look, I don't wanna
hear about it.

07:57.033 --> 08:00.166
Oh, my God, I'm storming out
to the bathroom.

08:00.233 --> 08:02.033
Will you look at what we have?

08:02.100 --> 08:05.400
-We make each other happy.
-You lied to me.

08:05.467 --> 08:08.567
I couldn't lie to you.
That's why I told you.

08:08.633 --> 08:10.667
Don't end this, Dorothy.

08:10.734 --> 08:13.467
You mean everything to me.
It's over with my wife.

08:13.533 --> 08:15.934
It's just hard to walk out
is all.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.567
Well, not for me, it isn't.

08:33.400 --> 08:35.333
-Hi, girls.
-(Blanche) Hi, Rose.

08:35.400 --> 08:37.367
Oh, Blanche,
remember a few days ago

08:37.433 --> 08:40.467
when I said your car was making a
funny kind of a noise sometimes?

08:40.533 --> 08:41.333
Uh-huh.

08:41.400 --> 08:43.233
Well, it's making it
all the time now.

08:43.300 --> 08:44.900
Oh, it's nothing serious,
I'm sure.

08:44.967 --> 08:47.300
And it started making
a wheezing, coughing,

08:47.367 --> 08:49.300
rattling kind of a sound
every time it goes up a hill.

08:49.367 --> 08:51.533
Uh-oh, that's a bad sign.

08:51.600 --> 08:53.400
Those are the sounds
Tony Triano made

08:53.467 --> 08:55.567
the night they wheeled him
out of the home on a gurney.

08:57.934 --> 09:00.600
That car is in terrific condition.

09:00.667 --> 09:03.567
All right, sometimes it's a little
hard to turn over in the morning.

09:03.633 --> 09:05.700
Tony Triano to a T.

09:07.834 --> 09:10.233
Maybe I should have
a mechanic check it out.

09:10.300 --> 09:12.567
Oh, Rose, wake up
and smell the coffee.

09:12.633 --> 09:16.200
An auto mechanic is the last person
to take a car to.

09:16.266 --> 09:18.967
They only make money if they tell
you there's something wrong with it.

09:20.467 --> 09:22.367
Oh, that's a good point.

09:24.066 --> 09:26.734
Boy, I wish I had a car to sell.

09:32.767 --> 09:35.033
(phone ringing)

09:36.800 --> 09:38.133
I'll get it.

09:42.567 --> 09:43.900
Hello?

09:44.867 --> 09:46.934
It's for Dorothy.
I think it's Glen.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.567
That's the fourth time
he's called today.

09:49.633 --> 09:51.000
You know
what we're supposed to tell him.

09:52.200 --> 09:53.400
Go on.

09:55.200 --> 09:58.667
Hello? Dorothy's not home, and
she's never coming home again.

09:58.734 --> 10:00.533
Now don't call here anymore.

10:01.667 --> 10:03.467
This is Rose.
Who is this?

10:04.734 --> 10:07.033
Mr. Yamamoto
from the school district?

10:07.100 --> 10:08.667
Oh, Rose.

10:08.734 --> 10:10.233
I'm so sorry.

10:10.300 --> 10:13.000
I thought you were the man
Dorothy's having the affair with.

10:16.066 --> 10:20.867
I mean, the man Dorothy said
is always so fair with... her.

10:20.934 --> 10:23.400
Of course,
I would expect you to be fair.

10:23.467 --> 10:26.734
And polite.
And good at math.

10:27.700 --> 10:30.500
I'm so glad you got
your own Disneyland.

10:31.166 --> 10:34.100
Oh, ah, thank you.

10:34.166 --> 10:35.333
Goodbye.

10:37.834 --> 10:40.300
Dorothy? Dorothy?

10:41.333 --> 10:44.000
Mr. Yamamoto just called
about a teaching job.

10:44.066 --> 10:46.834
Oh, I'm not ready
to go back to work yet.

10:50.467 --> 10:52.500
Are you depressed about Glen?

10:52.567 --> 10:56.734
No. I'm depressed because
Phyllis George left the morning news.

10:58.767 --> 11:01.433
Of course,
I'm depressed about Glen.

11:01.500 --> 11:04.600
I mean, for three weeks, he made me
the happiest woman in the world.

11:04.667 --> 11:07.066
This past week without him
has just been miserable.

11:07.133 --> 11:10.300
Well, at least you have the comfort
of knowing you did the right thing.

11:10.367 --> 11:11.934
Then why do I feel so rotten?

11:12.000 --> 11:14.800
Dorothy, he's married.
You have to forget him.

11:14.867 --> 11:16.433
I can't just forget him!

11:16.500 --> 11:20.300
Rose, come on.
None of us is a schoolgirl anymore.

11:20.367 --> 11:22.934
Although, quite frankly,
I am sometimes mistaken for one.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.800
Oh, please, Blanche.

11:26.734 --> 11:28.934
As long as Glen and Dorothy
are realistic

11:29.000 --> 11:32.633
and discreet about their situation,
who are they really hurting?

11:32.700 --> 11:34.800
No one. That's who.

11:34.867 --> 11:37.533
Blanche,
are you condoning their behavior?

11:37.600 --> 11:40.333
No. I'm just not passing judgment.

11:40.400 --> 11:43.500
Rose, sometimes life doesn't
work out the way we'd like it to.

11:43.567 --> 11:46.600
Sometimes we have to just grab our
happiness where we can get it.

11:46.667 --> 11:49.967
That's the same attitude that
broke up Debbie and Eddie.

11:50.033 --> 11:54.700
Eddie and Liz, Liz and Dick,
Martin and Lewis, Rowan and Martin--

11:54.767 --> 11:55.834
Shut up.

11:57.500 --> 12:00.400
(phone ringing)

12:00.467 --> 12:03.533
Hello?
Oh, hello, Glen.

12:03.600 --> 12:05.834
Hang up on that bed-hopper.

12:05.900 --> 12:08.266
Don't hang up on him.
That man cares for you.

12:08.333 --> 12:12.400
Hop, hop.
Go with your feelings.

12:12.467 --> 12:15.633
Glen, I thought I told you
I don't want to talk to you.

12:15.700 --> 12:19.600
That's right. If he wants to talk
or hop, let him do it with his wife.

12:19.667 --> 12:22.000
Don't deny your passion.
It's unnatural.

12:22.066 --> 12:26.133
Look, Glen, you are making this
very difficult for me.

12:26.734 --> 12:29.600
No, I will not change my mind.
Goodbye, Glen.

12:31.066 --> 12:33.567
Oh, Dorothy,
I'm proud of you.

12:33.633 --> 12:35.633
You'll see,
it's not the end of the world.

12:35.700 --> 12:37.967
No, just feels like it.

12:39.333 --> 12:42.000
Oh,
I hope I'm doing the right thing.

12:42.066 --> 12:43.500
Well, you are
if you really meant it

12:43.567 --> 12:45.567
when you said you never
want to see him again.

12:46.367 --> 12:48.734
Oh, come on.
Let's start supper.

12:48.800 --> 12:51.233
-Come on.
-I'll be with you in a minute.

13:03.533 --> 13:06.500
Glen? Dorothy.

13:07.200 --> 13:11.033
Yeah, I miss you.
I think we have to talk.

13:11.533 --> 13:14.700
Yes, yes,
Mr. Yamamoto, yes.

13:14.767 --> 13:17.233
Fine, I'll see you there.

13:17.300 --> 13:19.867
Oh, I'm so glad you're going back
to work.

13:19.934 --> 13:21.800
Yeah. He was thrilled too.

13:36.033 --> 13:37.000
Dorothy?

13:37.066 --> 13:39.533
What is this,
the Spanish inquisition?

13:39.600 --> 13:41.200
Look,
I don't have to defend myself.

13:41.266 --> 13:43.767
If I want to see Glen,
I'll see Glen.

13:44.266 --> 13:46.700
You're seeing Glen?
I don't wanna hear about it.

13:46.767 --> 13:47.900
Well, I don't wanna talk about it.

13:47.967 --> 13:49.467
-Good night.
-Good night.

13:57.200 --> 13:59.300
-What are you doing up so late?
-I was hungry.

13:59.367 --> 14:01.567
I was making myself a sandwich.
Do you want one?

14:01.633 --> 14:03.433
No, thanks.
We went out to dinner.

14:03.500 --> 14:04.900
Oh, that's nice.

14:04.967 --> 14:06.967
So you spent the evening
at dinner.

14:08.700 --> 14:10.400
No, we spent dinner
at dinner.

14:10.467 --> 14:12.767
We spent the evening
at a motel.

14:13.967 --> 14:16.800
A motel? Dorothy!

14:16.867 --> 14:21.166
A cheap, tawdry,
bare-bulb den of iniquity?

14:22.467 --> 14:25.867
We didn't drive to
Sodom and Gomorrah, Rose.

14:25.934 --> 14:27.934
It was a very pleasant place
over on Biscayne Bay.

14:28.033 --> 14:29.300
I told you
I didn't wanna hear about it!

14:29.367 --> 14:30.867
And I told you
I didn't wanna talk about it.

14:30.934 --> 14:32.133
-Good night.
-Good night.

14:42.500 --> 14:43.967
Maybe I'll have something.

14:44.033 --> 14:46.066
I was too nervous
to eat much at dinner.

14:46.133 --> 14:49.333
But I suppose the rest of the
evening really built up an appetite.

14:52.500 --> 14:55.233
Oh, hi. I didn't expect to see
you girls up so late.

14:55.300 --> 14:57.367
I'm just having a snack.

14:57.433 --> 15:00.200
Dorothy's the one
having an affair at a motel.

15:02.133 --> 15:03.467
Thank you, Rose.

15:03.967 --> 15:06.533
I just want to keep
the record straight.

15:06.600 --> 15:09.800
Besides, Blanche has had
experience in that area.

15:09.867 --> 15:11.633
Maybe she can give you
some advice.

15:11.700 --> 15:13.600
Oh, I certainly can.
In the first place,

15:13.667 --> 15:15.567
never check in
as Mr. and Mrs. Smith.

15:15.633 --> 15:18.333
Always check in
as Mr. and Mrs. Don Shula.

15:22.000 --> 15:22.800
What?

15:22.867 --> 15:25.400
That way, you always get
a complimentary fruit basket

15:25.467 --> 15:26.734
and a bottle of champagne.

15:27.600 --> 15:29.333
Good night.

15:29.400 --> 15:31.367
-Dorothy's seeing Glen again.
-That's right.

15:31.433 --> 15:34.333
And I don't need any advice.
I can handle it.

15:34.400 --> 15:36.667
Dorothy, I had a third cousin

15:36.734 --> 15:39.266
who ran around with a married man
for 15 years.

15:39.333 --> 15:40.533
Are they still together?

15:40.600 --> 15:43.633
Well, they would be
but his wife shot him in the...

15:45.800 --> 15:47.133
boxer shorts.

15:49.033 --> 15:50.433
And after that, he just kind of

15:50.500 --> 15:52.066
-lost interest.
-(Dorothy) ...lost interest.

15:54.667 --> 15:56.967
Evil is as evil does.

15:57.033 --> 15:59.533
Oh, will you stop
being so judgmental!

15:59.600 --> 16:02.533
This is a situation
you know nothing about!

16:02.600 --> 16:04.166
At least Blanche
has been there before,

16:04.233 --> 16:05.800
and she knows
what I'm going through.

16:05.867 --> 16:08.133
Well, not exactly.

16:08.200 --> 16:10.734
Actually, I've never
been with a married man.

16:10.800 --> 16:12.633
(both) Get out of here!

16:14.533 --> 16:15.900
No, it's true.

16:15.967 --> 16:19.533
I just never figured a relationship
with a married man was worthwhile.

16:19.600 --> 16:21.967
Good for you, Blanche.

16:22.033 --> 16:25.066
Well, I'm no fool.
The husband's always so guilty,

16:25.133 --> 16:27.934
he ends up giving the really
expensive gifts to the wife.

16:30.266 --> 16:33.367
Look, I didn't choose
for things to happen this way.

16:33.433 --> 16:34.700
I tried to do the right thing,

16:34.767 --> 16:37.100
but the right thing
was not right for me.

16:37.166 --> 16:38.533
I'm in love.

16:38.600 --> 16:42.066
And if there are sacrifices that
have to be made, I can accept them.

16:42.133 --> 16:44.934
I'm happy...
and that's what matters.

16:46.033 --> 16:47.100
Hi, Ma.

16:47.934 --> 16:50.633
So you started up with
your married man again.

16:51.133 --> 16:52.033
How did you know?

16:52.100 --> 16:53.934
I'm the amazing Kreskin.

16:56.533 --> 16:58.166
I was listening outside the door.

16:58.233 --> 17:00.233
-Oh, Ma.
-Oh!

17:00.300 --> 17:02.867
I can't put my ear to the door,
but you can put your--

17:02.934 --> 17:04.233
Ma!

17:07.533 --> 17:10.300
I raised you to have respect
for yourself,

17:10.367 --> 17:12.233
not be somebody's floozy.

17:29.900 --> 17:32.600
<i>♪ Purple rain ♪</i>

17:33.700 --> 17:36.700
Sophia! Sophia, where's Blanche?

17:36.767 --> 17:38.433
I have to talk to her
about her car.

17:38.500 --> 17:41.867
<i>♪ Purple rain ♪</i>

17:41.934 --> 17:43.500
Oh, hi, Rose.

17:43.567 --> 17:46.033
Blanche, about your car, I went
to the bank to get the money--

17:46.100 --> 17:48.367
-Honey, I can't sell you that car.
-But, Blanche--

17:48.433 --> 17:49.700
Honey, I can't sleep

17:49.767 --> 17:52.166
from all the worry and guilt
I have been suffering.

17:52.233 --> 17:54.567
I wasn't totally honest
with you, Rose.

17:54.633 --> 17:58.000
I told you that car
was in perfect condition.

17:58.066 --> 18:00.633
Well, it's not.
It's a piece of junk.

18:00.700 --> 18:02.867
It's the noisiest thing
to come out of Detroit

18:02.934 --> 18:04.800
since Martha
and the Vandellas.

18:06.033 --> 18:06.967
When I went to trade it in,

18:07.033 --> 18:09.433
they only offered me
half the blue book price.

18:09.500 --> 18:11.567
I need the whole amount
to put down on my new car,

18:11.633 --> 18:13.633
so that's why I tried
to sell it to you.

18:13.700 --> 18:16.700
But I can't go through with it.
I cannot sell you that car.

18:17.200 --> 18:20.400
You can't sell it to anyone.
Somebody stole it.

18:20.900 --> 18:21.767
What?

18:21.834 --> 18:24.367
-Somebody stole Blanche's--
-Well, very nice, Rose!

18:24.433 --> 18:28.500
I lend you a perfectly fine
automobile, no strings attached,

18:28.567 --> 18:30.633
and you let some thief
drive off in it.

18:30.700 --> 18:32.834
Rose Nylund,
I will never forgive you!

18:32.900 --> 18:35.433
Wasn't it insured?
They'll pay you full blue book.

18:35.500 --> 18:37.100
All is forgiven.

18:38.533 --> 18:40.233
I'm gonna go call the car dealer
right now

18:40.300 --> 18:41.633
and tell him he made a sale.

18:41.700 --> 18:46.667
Blanche, was the gist of
what you were saying before,

18:46.734 --> 18:48.800
that you intended to cheat me?

18:48.867 --> 18:50.333
Cheat you?

18:50.400 --> 18:53.133
Rose, you just analyze
everything to death.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.967
Ma, where are my shoes?

19:00.033 --> 19:02.467
Another date with
Mrs. O'Brien's husband?

19:02.533 --> 19:04.333
Now look,
don't you start with me.

19:04.400 --> 19:07.567
I will continue to see Glen
for as long as I please.

19:07.633 --> 19:08.967
Is he gonna leave his wife?

19:09.467 --> 19:10.333
Ma...

19:11.233 --> 19:13.734
Ma, for the first time
in a long time,

19:13.800 --> 19:18.233
I am really happy,
so please leave me alone.

19:18.300 --> 19:21.066
If you're so happy, how come I hear
you pacing in your room

19:21.133 --> 19:22.300
night after night?

19:22.367 --> 19:24.533
I can't sleep.
I have a lot on my mind.

19:24.600 --> 19:26.233
I'll tell you what's on your mind.

19:26.300 --> 19:27.867
-You hate yourself.
-I do not.

19:27.934 --> 19:29.266
My mistake.

19:29.333 --> 19:31.133
I've only known you
since the day you were born.

19:31.200 --> 19:33.033
Look, I've heard enough, Ma.

19:33.100 --> 19:37.767
I'm leaving now to meet Glen and
have a perfectly marvelous time.

19:38.266 --> 19:40.533
I hope he's taking you bowling.

19:40.600 --> 19:43.000
-Bowling?
-Yeah, you could rent shoes there.

19:44.834 --> 19:46.433
There!

20:04.567 --> 20:06.433
Sweetheart, if you want
to grab some dinner,

20:06.500 --> 20:07.767
we'll have to take separate cars.

20:07.834 --> 20:10.600
I'm gonna have to leave for
home right from the restaurant.

20:17.467 --> 20:20.700
Glen, forget dinner.
We need to talk.

20:23.800 --> 20:25.934
Things aren't
working out anymore,

20:26.000 --> 20:29.000
and I don't know what to do
to make them any better.

20:31.266 --> 20:32.567
You can't leave your wife,

20:32.633 --> 20:35.834
and I'm not cut out
to be the other woman.

20:36.800 --> 20:38.333
Dorothy, you know I love you.

20:38.400 --> 20:40.800
I know that, but it's not enough.

20:41.300 --> 20:42.667
I don't wanna lose you.

20:42.734 --> 20:45.967
I don't wanna lose you, either.
That's why I came back.

20:46.033 --> 20:48.900
I thought you understood,
I can't break up my marriage!

20:48.967 --> 20:51.100
Not now,
not at this stage of my life.

20:51.166 --> 20:54.867
If things didn't work out between
you and me, I'd be alone.

20:56.066 --> 20:58.867
That kind of risk is fine
when you're 40,

20:58.934 --> 21:00.533
but I couldn't do it today.

21:00.600 --> 21:02.200
I'm too old for that, Dorothy.

21:02.700 --> 21:06.100
Glen, the risk shouldn't scare you
at any age.

21:06.166 --> 21:09.500
And at any age, the loving
would make it worthwhile.

21:10.066 --> 21:14.000
You want a safe, easy,
comfortable home life

21:14.066 --> 21:19.133
and a romance and excitement
on the side, and it's not for me.

21:19.200 --> 21:22.000
Dorothy, please think about
what you're throwing away.

21:22.066 --> 21:24.867
If I stay,
I am throwing away my future.

21:28.467 --> 21:29.934
Now I'll go home.

21:30.767 --> 21:32.500
I'll hurt.

21:33.166 --> 21:37.500
But after a while, I'll feel better,
and I'll go on with my life.

21:38.367 --> 21:41.000
If I continue this,
I'll end up alone,

21:41.066 --> 21:44.867
and I care too much about
myself to let that happen.

21:49.066 --> 21:50.500
Dorothy, I love you.

21:51.567 --> 21:53.000
I love you too.

21:55.934 --> 21:57.100
Goodbye.

22:15.533 --> 22:17.066
Hi, Ma.

22:17.133 --> 22:18.300
You're home early.

22:19.934 --> 22:21.467
I broke up with Glen.

22:21.533 --> 22:23.433
I told him I couldn't
see him anymore.

22:24.367 --> 22:25.467
I'm sorry.

22:26.500 --> 22:27.834
I thought you'd be happy.

22:27.900 --> 22:30.533
You want me to be happy?
Help me put away the dishes.

22:39.934 --> 22:41.467
You still angry with me?

22:41.533 --> 22:43.700
I was never really angry.
I was worried.

22:44.333 --> 22:46.266
I don't like seeing you in pain.

22:47.600 --> 22:49.033
You still angry with me?

22:49.100 --> 22:50.333
What for?

22:50.400 --> 22:53.166
For trying to stop your daughter
from making a mistake?

22:53.233 --> 22:54.734
Somebody has to.

22:54.800 --> 22:57.600
You kids get to be middle-aged,
you think you know everything.

23:01.767 --> 23:03.967
I don't care what you say,
you were speeding.

23:04.033 --> 23:07.066
I tell you that is not why that
highway patrolman was following us.

23:07.133 --> 23:09.367
(Dorothy)
Oh, Blanche, please!

23:09.433 --> 23:11.433
Dorothy?
Oh, I thought you were out.

23:11.500 --> 23:13.433
No, we ended the evening early.

23:13.934 --> 23:16.000
You and Glen
have a disagreement?

23:16.066 --> 23:19.000
Yeah, he thinks
he should stay married.

23:19.066 --> 23:20.633
You mean it's over?

23:21.700 --> 23:24.500
Look, we just came back
to pick Sophia up.

23:24.567 --> 23:25.967
Blanche got her new car.

23:26.033 --> 23:28.166
Yeah, and we're all gonna
pile in and go cruising.

23:28.233 --> 23:29.266
Do you want to go with us?

23:29.333 --> 23:32.433
No. I think I'll just
stay home tonight.

23:32.500 --> 23:34.900
I feel... you know...

23:36.100 --> 23:37.834
you know, just sitting.

23:39.233 --> 23:41.700
Me too.
I think I'll have a cup of tea.

23:41.767 --> 23:44.100
Yeah, it's kind of late.
I'm a little tired.

23:44.166 --> 23:45.967
I think I'll just stick around.

23:46.033 --> 23:48.767
What the heck. That car will still
be there tomorrow.

23:56.166 --> 23:58.734
Boy, this is depressing!

23:58.800 --> 24:00.934
Girls, let's go cruising.

24:01.734 --> 24:04.433
I know a place where guys
wrestle naked in the mud.
