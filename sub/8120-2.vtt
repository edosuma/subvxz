What do you want, Granddad?
Who was it?

00:48.640 --> 00:51.120
I don't know.
It stopped before I got to it.

00:51.120 --> 00:53.800
Was it for me?
I don't fuckin' know!

00:55.440 --> 00:57.520
What do you think I am,
a psychopath?

BANGING

01:15.160 --> 01:17.400
What? Who was it?

01:17.400 --> 01:21.640
Murphy's Funeral Home. They want
to know what height you are.

01:32.280 --> 01:33.440
Right, I'm going...

01:35.520 --> 01:37.720
..out the back to hang out clothes.

01:39.640 --> 01:40.760
Goodbye now.

02:08.680 --> 02:10.240
They can fuck off.

02:14.480 --> 02:16.640
C'mon, Thomas,
I'll put the kettle on.

02:16.640 --> 02:18.880
Actually,
there's no need to make tea.

02:18.880 --> 02:21.440
I just want to ask you
something important.

02:21.440 --> 02:23.960
In private...
Sit down, Thomas.

02:23.960 --> 02:26.880
What's so important that you needed
to talk to me on my own?

02:26.880 --> 02:29.960
I want to ask you something.
It's...rather a big thing.

02:29.960 --> 02:33.080
Go on. Well, I'm not getting
any younger

02:33.080 --> 02:36.240
and, well, time comes for...change.

02:36.240 --> 02:37.840

Hello, Mrs Bro...

02:46.160 --> 02:47.720
Hello? How do you do?

02:48.720 --> 02:50.320
No, he's not here.

02:50.320 --> 02:52.000
OK, I'll tell him.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.760
You thought you'd fuckin' had me,
didn't ya?

02:58.480 --> 03:00.520
Hello, love. Hello, Thomas.

03:00.520 --> 03:02.000
Hello, Mrs Brown.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.960
Perhaps we should do this
another time.

03:03.960 --> 03:06.560
But, Thomas... No, no really.
Another time.

03:10.640 --> 03:13.000
You spoilt it again.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.400
Why do you have to embarrass me
every time?

03:16.400 --> 03:18.640
Me embarrass you?

03:18.640 --> 03:20.960
How do you think I feel
when the neighbours say,

03:20.960 --> 03:24.040
"Is that your daughter
with Worzel fuckin' Gummidge?"

03:27.680 --> 03:29.480
Hello.

03:29.480 --> 03:30.800
Come into the kitchen.

03:34.840 --> 03:37.760
I don't know what's wrong
with Cathy.

03:37.760 --> 03:40.840
She's besotted with
this Thomas fella. Professor...

03:42.240 --> 03:43.280
..Clown.

03:45.640 --> 03:48.040
You know, you'd think
if she had somebody that she likes,

03:48.040 --> 03:50.880
you know,
she wouldn't be as jumpy as she is.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.840
I don't like him,
not one feckin' bit.

03:55.840 --> 03:57.400
He's too into himself.

03:57.400 --> 04:00.240
You know, I can see him
strolling down Lover's Lane,

04:00.240 --> 04:02.280
hand in hand with himself.

04:04.720 --> 04:08.840
Cathy needs to understand
that...love is like snow.

04:10.480 --> 04:13.040
You know, you don't know
if its going to stick.

04:13.040 --> 04:16.680
And you never know how many inches
you're going to get.

04:16.680 --> 04:18.720
Who's getting inches?

04:18.720 --> 04:21.080
Not yours truly anyway.

04:22.960 --> 04:25.160
So how is everybody?
Ah, grand.

04:25.160 --> 04:28.120
Cathy's still cavorting
with ya man Professor Clown.

04:28.120 --> 04:31.760
Well, at least Cathy does something
about a boyfriend. My Sharon does...

04:31.760 --> 04:33.760
Everybody! ..nothing.

04:33.760 --> 04:36.680
Nothing. That's what I meant,
nothing, yeah.

04:36.680 --> 04:40.400
I often wonder,
will she ever lose her virginity?

04:40.400 --> 04:41.680
I mean, she's such a...

04:41.680 --> 04:43.280
Bike.

04:43.280 --> 04:45.040
..shy girl.

04:45.040 --> 04:47.640
Shy girl, that's what I meant.
Yes. Shy, yeah.

04:50.240 --> 04:53.520
Look, I don't know what's
going on with Sharon's relationships

04:53.520 --> 04:56.720
but Cathy's just like
a bag of feckin' cats.

04:56.720 --> 04:59.560
She nearly bit the head off me
just then. Sharon's the same.

04:59.560 --> 05:01.840
I asked her when she was going
to get a better job

05:01.840 --> 05:03.600
and she just nearly devoured me.

05:03.600 --> 05:05.600
But she likes that job
she has in Foley's.

05:05.600 --> 05:07.560
She speaks four languages, Agnes.

05:07.560 --> 05:11.720
And she can't say no in any of them!
What?

05:11.720 --> 05:13.920
Nothing. Nothing.

05:13.920 --> 05:18.080
Great news. Mammy. Me and Dino
are getting a condominium.

05:18.080 --> 05:19.600
That's fantastic.

05:19.600 --> 05:22.000
Rory, be careful.
They're not a 100% safe.

05:23.680 --> 05:25.240
Your Mammy's right, Rory.

05:25.240 --> 05:28.480
Sharon's friend wore one of them
and got run over by a bus.

05:28.480 --> 05:30.640
Well, shows you.

05:31.680 --> 05:34.120
We've got an apartment.

05:34.120 --> 05:36.080
Con-do-minium.

05:36.080 --> 05:37.600
All-fuckin'-right.

05:39.360 --> 05:41.120
It's gorgeous.

05:41.120 --> 05:43.000
Fuckin' flies.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.360
We're only hoping now
that it will be ready

05:45.360 --> 05:47.680
before Dino gets
turfed out of the bedsit.

05:47.680 --> 05:50.400
Ah, well, I'm happy that
yous are happy. Where is it?

05:50.400 --> 05:51.440
In Kil...

05:54.920 --> 05:57.200
BUZZING

06:05.920 --> 06:08.840
I'm sorry, love, where is it?

06:08.840 --> 06:12.680
It's in Kilbride, Mrs Brown. Oh!
Oh, it's beautiful.

06:12.680 --> 06:14.760
Oh, that's very far out, Rory.

06:14.760 --> 06:18.040
I mean, that's going to be a long
trek in and out of Wash & Blow.

06:18.040 --> 06:20.200
That's why I'm doing this.

06:20.200 --> 06:23.080
Driving lessons.
Oh, Rory, I don't know.

06:23.080 --> 06:24.960
Remember the first time you drove?

06:24.960 --> 06:27.240
Oh, God, you cried so much
I had to go into the shop

06:27.240 --> 06:29.120
and ask the man
to pull out the plug.

06:30.240 --> 06:31.600
I'd be grand.

06:31.600 --> 06:35.160
The instructor said, if I do the
course, I'd pass me test no problem.

06:35.160 --> 06:37.000
That's what the last
instructor said.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.440
You had lessons before?

06:38.440 --> 06:41.080
Tell him, tell him!
Well, I put the car into gear

06:41.080 --> 06:44.600
and when it started, the instructor
started shouting, "Stop! Stop!"

06:44.600 --> 06:46.600
The man hadn't got into the car yet!

06:48.800 --> 06:50.120
I couldn't stop it.

06:50.120 --> 06:52.240
I said to Mammy,
"How do I stop this thing?"

06:52.240 --> 06:54.520
What were you doing in the car,
Mrs Brown?

06:54.520 --> 06:56.480
I was feckin' praying, son.

06:58.320 --> 07:02.640
So what happened? Well, you know
the flower shop on Rathmore Street?

07:02.640 --> 07:04.880
There is no flower shop
in Rathmore Street.

07:04.880 --> 07:06.880
Exactly! Not now!

07:08.360 --> 07:10.960
Don't do it, Rory.
It's too dangerous.

07:10.960 --> 07:12.960
No, I am doing it.

07:14.120 --> 07:16.160
Danger is my middle name.

07:19.840 --> 07:22.080
Bond. James Bond.

07:23.160 --> 07:24.800
Off. Fuck off.

07:27.320 --> 07:30.320
Do you know, at first
I was really nervous about this,

07:30.320 --> 07:32.160
but now I'm excited.

07:32.160 --> 07:33.560
Excited about what?

07:33.560 --> 07:35.240
Driving lessons.

07:35.240 --> 07:37.720
Why would you get driving lessons
when you haven't got a car?

07:37.720 --> 07:39.680
I don't say anything
when you buy a bra.

07:48.840 --> 07:51.640
D'you want tea?
Yes, please, Mammy.

07:51.640 --> 07:54.720
Fine. Look, I'm sorry
for snapping earlier.

07:54.720 --> 07:58.120
It's all right, love,
that's what dinosaurs do.

07:58.120 --> 08:00.000
Argh! Thanks, Mammy.

08:01.920 --> 08:04.520
How is? Dermot is not here.

08:04.520 --> 08:07.280
Actually I'm looking for you,
Mrs Brown. I don't want any.

08:07.280 --> 08:10.320
Dermot tells me you're looking
to get your kitchen done.

08:10.320 --> 08:13.840
Yes, so? Well, I don't know
if you were aware, Mrs Brown,

08:13.840 --> 08:16.400
but I have a lot of experience
in renovations.

08:16.400 --> 08:19.720
No, I wasn't aware.
Because you don't!

08:21.320 --> 08:24.000
Look, all I want is a chance
to quote for the job.

08:26.480 --> 08:28.160
Fine, you can quote.

08:28.160 --> 08:29.560
Seven and a half grand.

08:32.040 --> 08:34.520
For what? For me. That's my quote.

08:34.520 --> 08:36.000
Buster, to put in a quote,

08:36.000 --> 08:38.800
you have to show Mammy
what you're going to do,

08:38.800 --> 08:40.720
take measurements and that,

08:40.720 --> 08:44.520
decide how long it's going to take
and then how much.

08:44.520 --> 08:46.080
Seven and a half grand.

08:53.160 --> 08:56.440
HE SNORES

08:57.960 --> 09:00.120
What the feckin'!
What are you doin'?

09:00.120 --> 09:02.880
Mammy, I want to talk to you
about something important.

09:02.880 --> 09:04.680
That's what ad breaks are for.

09:06.720 --> 09:10.080
What? Mammy,
what did you do to impress Daddy?

09:10.080 --> 09:13.400
What do you mean impress him?
You know, when you were dating.

09:13.400 --> 09:15.560
What did you have to do
to keep him interested?

09:15.560 --> 09:17.040
Fuckin' turn up!

09:19.360 --> 09:20.760
Why, what's on your mind?

09:20.760 --> 09:23.000
I was thinking about
getting a boob job.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.280
And what's wrong with
the job you have?

09:26.640 --> 09:30.200
No, Mammy, a boob job!
Breast enlargements.

09:30.200 --> 09:31.960
Oh, yeah...

09:31.960 --> 09:35.000
I have enough money saved.
What do you think?

09:35.000 --> 09:37.520
I think you should do
whatever you want to do, love.

09:37.520 --> 09:40.400
Thomas is always looking at women
with big breasts.

09:40.400 --> 09:43.240
A man looking at women
with big breasts.

09:43.240 --> 09:44.760
Wonders will never cease.

09:45.920 --> 09:47.880
Mammy, would you change anything?

09:47.880 --> 09:51.720
Never, no.
I was always very proud of my body.

09:51.720 --> 09:54.840
I used to just strip naked
and stand in front of the mirror.

09:54.840 --> 09:56.080
I'd go, "Hm-hm-hm-hm!

09:57.840 --> 09:59.480
"Go on, you good thing."

09:59.480 --> 10:03.560
Everybody else in the butcher's
would just stare at me.

10:05.920 --> 10:09.320
But they weren't getting their mince
for 40 pence a pound.

10:11.280 --> 10:14.600
Seriously, Mammy, if you had
had access to plastic surgery,

10:14.600 --> 10:17.000
what would you have gotten done?

10:17.000 --> 10:20.240
I might have got a couple of inches
put onto your father's penis.

10:24.120 --> 10:26.440
That's just me
being feckin' greedy now!

10:28.880 --> 10:32.720
Listen, Cathy love, you get a titty
job, that's your own business.

10:32.720 --> 10:34.960
But I think it might be
much better for you

10:34.960 --> 10:38.920
if you found somebody who loves you
just the way you are.

10:38.920 --> 10:40.920
It's not like that any more, Mammy.

10:42.080 --> 10:45.120
It's not enough to just turn up.

10:46.200 --> 10:50.160
Well, maybe it is...
for the right man! Uh!

10:52.120 --> 10:54.640
What's a mother to do?

10:55.920 --> 10:58.000
END MUSIC PLAYS

10:58.000 --> 10:59.880
Ah, bollocks!

11:07.360 --> 11:11.760
Mrs Brown, this is the best
draughtsman in the city.

11:11.760 --> 11:13.720
He's the best there is?

11:13.720 --> 11:15.320
Hello.

11:18.920 --> 11:21.280
Hello, Mr...
His name is Giddyeye.

11:21.280 --> 11:25.320
Giddyeye.
Pleased to meet you, Mrs Brown.

11:25.320 --> 11:27.600
Now, can you show us the kitchen?

11:31.120 --> 11:33.720
We're in the fuckin' kitchen.

11:33.720 --> 11:35.520
Oh, yeah of course.

11:35.520 --> 11:39.240
First thing we need to do
is better lighting.

11:40.640 --> 11:42.520
It's almost pitch black in here.

11:45.360 --> 11:47.320
Pitch black? He's very cheap.

11:47.320 --> 11:49.080
He can't see!

11:50.120 --> 11:53.240
Of course he can see!
Just not very well.

11:53.240 --> 11:55.640
He can make out shapes
close to his face.

11:57.360 --> 11:58.960
Can you make out that shape?

12:01.360 --> 12:04.040
Hey, who are you? Jesus Christ!

12:04.040 --> 12:06.440
What are you doing?
This sink is far too big.

12:06.440 --> 12:08.360
What?

12:09.600 --> 12:11.960
Hello, Blondie.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.520
Buster, get Helen Keller
out of here.

12:18.320 --> 12:20.000
C'mon Giddyeye, we're going.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.360
Looking forward to seeing you
again soon, Mrs Brown.

12:22.360 --> 12:25.240
I'm looking forward to you seeing me
for the fuckin' first time!

12:29.560 --> 12:31.000
Lying bastard!

12:33.080 --> 12:34.280
Shit! Shit!

12:36.760 --> 12:38.720
"Wedding dress for sale.

12:39.760 --> 12:40.800
"Worn once...

12:43.600 --> 12:45.080
"..by mistake."

12:58.280 --> 13:00.480
Tea, love? Yes, please, Mammy.

13:01.720 --> 13:03.960
Well, what do you think?

13:03.960 --> 13:05.920
What do I think of what?

13:05.920 --> 13:10.400
You got it done already?
No, I'm wearing a size decider.

13:10.400 --> 13:13.840
What? The clinic want me
to be sure I get the size I want,

13:13.840 --> 13:16.800
so they gave me this
to try out different sizes.

13:16.800 --> 13:18.840
It adjusts, watch.

13:18.840 --> 13:21.320
HISSING

13:29.120 --> 13:30.360
Inflatable titties!

13:32.120 --> 13:35.240
It's amazing! I'm going to try it
out on my date tomorrow night.

13:35.240 --> 13:37.920
Hope Thomas reacts the way
I think he will.

13:37.920 --> 13:41.720
I wonder will he notice it? Oh,
believe me, he'll fuckin' notice.

13:41.720 --> 13:43.960
How do you get them
to go down again?

13:43.960 --> 13:47.520
I'm not sure.
The instructions are upstairs.

13:52.840 --> 13:54.480
And what do you two want?

13:54.480 --> 13:56.360
Tell her, will you, Dermo?

13:56.360 --> 13:58.960
Mammy, Giddyeye isn't going
to design your kitchen.

13:58.960 --> 14:01.520
Buster knows what he wants.
Seven and a half grand.

14:02.600 --> 14:04.240
But to get it past the council,

14:04.240 --> 14:06.320
he has to get
a draughtsman's signature.

14:06.320 --> 14:08.040
That's all he needs Giddyeye for.

14:08.040 --> 14:11.600
So Giddyeye is going to sign it?
How? In Braille?

14:11.600 --> 14:14.560
It's just to cover meself and you.

14:14.560 --> 14:18.840
Look, I'll trust him this time,
but I'm telling you, Buster,
don't you push me!

14:18.840 --> 14:20.560
How did Cathy get on at the clinic?

14:20.560 --> 14:23.480
How did you know about Cathy and
the clinic? Maria was telling me.

14:23.480 --> 14:26.560
Well, it's private and personal
and it's not to be discussed.

14:26.560 --> 14:28.200
They gave her blow-up titties.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.560
It all goes different sizes

14:31.560 --> 14:33.320
because she has to decide
what size she wants,

14:33.320 --> 14:36.960
cos some women are different,
you know, you don't want to get...

14:38.600 --> 14:41.960
Get 'em too long
and you're in the shower
trying to fuckin' wash them...

14:47.200 --> 14:49.440
Oh, right.
Is Cathy sick, Dermo?

14:49.440 --> 14:50.800
No, she's getting a boob job.

14:50.800 --> 14:52.680
That's none of his fuckin' business.

14:52.680 --> 14:55.600
You're right, Ma.
Buster, you never heard that.

14:55.600 --> 14:58.000
You'll have to speak up, Dermo.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.560
Ssh! You two,
don't open your fuckin' mouth.

15:01.760 --> 15:03.160
I don't know where it is.

15:03.160 --> 15:04.880
Oh, hiya, Dermot.

15:08.280 --> 15:09.320
Hiya, Cathy.

15:09.320 --> 15:11.400
Hel-lo, Cathy!

15:13.280 --> 15:16.520
Hello, Buster. I heard
you're getting your tits blown up?

15:18.320 --> 15:19.360
Buster, out!

15:23.040 --> 15:24.480
And who told him?

15:24.480 --> 15:28.360
Nobody! But in fairness, you know...

15:28.360 --> 15:29.760
I suppose.

15:29.760 --> 15:32.840
Would you like a cup of tits...
tea, love! Tea, cup of tea.

15:34.960 --> 15:38.040
I should have known better than
trusting you with a secret.

15:38.040 --> 15:40.760
Well, I meant PG tits... Tips!

15:40.760 --> 15:43.360
PG...tips.

15:45.160 --> 15:47.800
I'm so disappointed with Cathy.

15:47.800 --> 15:50.800
I think she's beautiful
just the way she is.

15:50.800 --> 15:53.920
Why, what's wrong with her? She's
talking about getting implants.

15:53.920 --> 15:56.240
Don't talk to me, I went about them.

15:56.240 --> 15:58.680
Never been so embarrassed
in me life.

15:58.680 --> 15:59.760
I didn't know that. When?

15:59.760 --> 16:02.800
Oh, a long while ago. Ten years now.

16:02.800 --> 16:05.800
I thought I'd go and ask
if implants would be any good.

16:05.800 --> 16:09.760
I was only in there five minutes and
he started feeling me jing-jangs.

16:11.160 --> 16:13.480
Well, I let out a scream.

16:13.480 --> 16:15.360
Worst dentist I've even been to.

16:18.200 --> 16:21.000
Winnie, I was talk...
Oh, it doesn't matter.

16:21.000 --> 16:24.040
I can see where Cathy's coming from,
getting a boob job.

16:24.040 --> 16:26.720
It's all down to
how you feel about yourself.

16:26.720 --> 16:29.240
Its all about S-E-K-S.

16:30.720 --> 16:32.320
Sex!

16:34.080 --> 16:37.520
No, Mrs Brown, Betty's right.
A woman needs good self-esteem.

16:37.520 --> 16:38.680
Does she?

16:38.680 --> 16:42.440
When was the last time a man asked
to feel your self-esteem, Winnie?

16:44.960 --> 16:47.640
No, the world's gone sex mad.
I see young boys now

16:47.640 --> 16:51.000
and they're dressing like
they're feckin' Chippendales.

16:51.000 --> 16:54.240
I hear young girls now talking
like adults, and they're only 12.

16:54.240 --> 16:56.880
I don't remember even
thinking about sex at that age.

16:56.880 --> 17:01.080
It's different for men, Maria.
Sex is a big thing to them.

17:01.080 --> 17:04.120
My Jacko can remember
the first time he had sex.

17:04.120 --> 17:06.040
He still has the fuckin' receipt.

17:08.560 --> 17:11.840
Hiya's!
Hiya! So, what's the conversation?

17:11.840 --> 17:13.880
Ah, don't you know? Men and sex.

17:13.880 --> 17:16.480
What do they say?
You can't have one...

17:16.480 --> 17:18.480
ALL: ..without the other.

17:18.480 --> 17:19.520
Yes, you can.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.600
Winnie, you stay away
from that tumble dryer.

17:29.800 --> 17:32.520
You know, I'd rather clean
me oven than have sex.

17:32.520 --> 17:35.800
Really? Yes. If I'm going to be
on my hands and knees for 15 minutes

17:35.800 --> 17:38.000
I want something
to fuckin' show for it!

17:41.200 --> 17:44.840
No, Cathy, don't order, I have to go
home and let Dermot out for a pint.

17:44.840 --> 17:48.120
Come back to my place and I'll open
up a bottle of wine. Great. Betty?

17:48.120 --> 17:49.880
Have you only got the one bottle?

17:54.320 --> 17:56.280
What are you smiling at?

17:56.280 --> 17:59.720
You know the inflatable titties
that Cathy got? Uh-huh.

17:59.720 --> 18:01.640
I'm wearing them!

18:03.680 --> 18:06.080
You are not!

18:06.080 --> 18:07.760
Here, show me.

18:07.760 --> 18:09.880
There's a gizmo here,
takes a second.

18:20.760 --> 18:22.640
Hello, Father Damien.

18:22.640 --> 18:26.320
Mrs Brown. I just wanted to tell you
your Mark was out was out
with me today.

18:26.320 --> 18:28.800
Thank you. Winnie, get the switch!

18:28.800 --> 18:32.240
He was looking for a reference from
me for his emigration application.

18:32.240 --> 18:34.720
I don't know him that well,
but I gave him a good one.

18:34.720 --> 18:37.920
Oh, thank you, Father.
Winnie, for fuck's sake!

18:37.920 --> 18:39.960
My pleasure,
he's such a fine young man.

18:39.960 --> 18:41.960
He'll be a great loss
to the community.

18:41.960 --> 18:43.480
Winnie, do something!

18:43.480 --> 18:46.160
Mrs Brown, are your tits swelling?

18:46.160 --> 18:47.880
I beg your pardon?

18:47.880 --> 18:51.160
It's just that...
Winnie, do something now!

18:51.160 --> 18:54.880
HISSING

19:02.400 --> 19:06.480
Right then, I'll...
I'll leave you two with it.

19:21.960 --> 19:23.800
Have you got everything you need?

19:23.800 --> 19:25.360
That's nearly everything.

19:25.360 --> 19:28.640
Birth, baptism certificate,
stamped letter from the police.

19:28.640 --> 19:30.520
Just a couple of references
to get now,

19:30.520 --> 19:33.480
send them all off to the Australian
embassy. And that's it.

19:36.160 --> 19:37.600
And when will you know...

19:40.800 --> 19:43.240
When will you know
if you have the visas?

19:43.240 --> 19:46.600
A few weeks, I'd say.
Then we do medicals. That quick?

19:53.840 --> 19:55.800
So when do you think
you'll be going?

19:55.800 --> 19:57.880
No complications,
I'd say a few weeks.

19:57.880 --> 20:01.720
Well, I won't lie to you,.
I wish you weren't going.

20:01.720 --> 20:05.240
Neither do I, but I have to do
what's best for me family.

20:05.240 --> 20:07.200
Anyway, you can come out and visit.

20:07.200 --> 20:10.880
To Australia? Oh, no, love,
nobody out there knows me.

20:14.800 --> 20:16.680
We do and that's all that matters.

20:16.680 --> 20:20.080
Yes, love. Right, I'm off.
I'll see you tomorrow.

20:20.080 --> 20:22.520
Oh, by the way,
what's happening with the kitchen?

20:22.520 --> 20:25.040
Buster says he's got
a couple of pieces to put in place,

20:25.040 --> 20:27.560
before he can give us a quote.
But he'll get back to us.

20:27.560 --> 20:30.000
I'll be here to keep an eye on him
for most of it. See ya.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.360
Bye love. Hey. Rory.

20:32.360 --> 20:34.680
Hello, love. Cup of tea?

20:34.680 --> 20:37.560
No, thanks, Mammy. Have you got
anything for a headache?

20:37.560 --> 20:38.920
Me head is pounding.

20:38.920 --> 20:40.800
How did the driving lesson go today?

20:40.800 --> 20:42.520
Not great.

20:42.520 --> 20:45.640
Mammy, what do you do
when a policeman does that?

20:46.920 --> 20:48.040
You slow down.

20:48.040 --> 20:49.960
What do you do when he does that?

20:49.960 --> 20:51.440
You stop.

20:51.440 --> 20:55.200
And what do you do when he goes,
"Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck?"

20:56.480 --> 20:58.760
You drive on as quick
as you feckin' can!

21:01.640 --> 21:04.800
Oh, Rory,
sounds like you had a rough day.

21:04.800 --> 21:07.480
I can't get the hang
of this parking thing.

21:07.480 --> 21:10.400
Now, the instructor was
very nice about it.

21:10.400 --> 21:13.880
He said, "It's OK,
I'll get out your side."

21:13.880 --> 21:17.480
He told me
to bring a crash helmet next time.

21:17.480 --> 21:20.200
You'd look stupid
driving around in a crash helmet.

21:20.200 --> 21:21.960
No, for him!

21:23.680 --> 21:27.200
How are ya? I've got the designs.

21:31.680 --> 21:33.440
Do you know something, Buster?

21:33.440 --> 21:37.040
I do - bats always turn left
when they come out of a cave.

21:40.960 --> 21:44.240
Do you know, this is very good.
It's perfect.

21:44.240 --> 21:46.880
I just need to make
a couple of changes.

21:46.880 --> 21:49.440
Mark and Betty,
they're going to Australia.

21:49.440 --> 21:51.600
So fly away, Mark, fly away, Betty.

21:51.600 --> 21:53.600
And it's all going to be
good quality.

21:53.600 --> 21:57.000
I'm getting it from
that Scandinavian company
with the small name.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.520
IKEA. Lego.

22:03.480 --> 22:05.280
Just kidding. It is, it's IKEA.

22:07.600 --> 22:09.560
Buster, this is good.

22:11.520 --> 22:13.800
OK, Buster, you have the job.

22:13.800 --> 22:15.520
Ah, thanks, Mrs Brown.

22:16.920 --> 22:18.320
Cancel the Lego.

22:22.040 --> 22:24.240
It's a great idea,
a night at the bingo.

22:24.240 --> 22:26.000
Imagine if we won the jackpot?

22:26.000 --> 22:29.480
Yes, then maybe Mark wouldn't have
to emigrate to Australia.

22:29.480 --> 22:32.200
Mrs Brown, we don't want to
emigrate, but what can we do?

22:33.960 --> 22:36.200
Cathy is meeting Clown
after the bingo.

22:36.200 --> 22:38.720
Do you think he's going to
pop the question soon?

22:38.720 --> 22:41.120
Oh, wouldn't that be lovely.
Gorgeous.

22:41.120 --> 22:45.120
Excuse me...do any of you
like Clown?

22:45.120 --> 22:47.160
God, no, he's a boring old shit!

22:49.240 --> 22:52.400
Hello?! Why would you want him
to marry Cathy?

22:52.400 --> 22:55.040
Well... It's a wedding.
I love a wedding.

22:55.040 --> 22:57.280
And who knows,
he might make her very happy.

22:57.280 --> 22:59.040
If he dies at the reception.

23:01.880 --> 23:05.120
Do any of yous have any idea
what it's like to live with a man

23:05.120 --> 23:08.240
who's a complete bore
and has no personality?

23:08.240 --> 23:10.200
Tell them, Winnie.

23:12.400 --> 23:13.640
Well...

23:16.640 --> 23:20.080
Hold on now, Agnes,
Jacko does have his moment.

23:20.080 --> 23:21.920
When?

23:21.920 --> 23:25.720
April 8th 1985.
When Sharon was little.

23:25.720 --> 23:27.800
Ha-ha-ha! Sharon...little!

23:29.920 --> 23:33.960
I said to her, "Would you like your
daddy to make you toasted soldiers?"

23:35.280 --> 23:39.200
And quick as a flash he said,
"Daddy won't, but Mammy will."

23:41.840 --> 23:44.720
Oh, it still makes me laugh today.

23:48.240 --> 23:50.240
And that's what you want for Cathy?

23:51.920 --> 23:53.600
So, how do I look?

23:53.600 --> 23:55.440
You look lovely. Stunning.

23:55.440 --> 23:58.680
I'm wearing my tester boobs.
I thought I'd try them out on Thomas.

23:58.680 --> 24:00.840
But I bit...
Ha-ha! Winnie!

24:02.440 --> 24:04.160
Toasty soldiers, I get it now!

24:05.920 --> 24:07.160
Shut your fu...

24:08.720 --> 24:10.880
Here, Cathy, give us
a demonstration.

24:10.880 --> 24:12.520
Yeah, show us how it works.

24:12.520 --> 24:13.960
This mightn't be the right time now.

24:13.960 --> 24:15.400
Because I bit... Winnie!

24:18.080 --> 24:22.240
Hello, Thomas. What are you doing
here? I was just heading out.

24:22.240 --> 24:25.000
Could I have a moment...in private?

24:25.000 --> 24:26.840
Sure, we'll go on ahead.

24:26.840 --> 24:29.160
Follow us down, Cathy.
C'mon, let's go.

24:36.240 --> 24:40.120
Sit down, Thomas.
I'm glad you called.

24:40.120 --> 24:43.320
Actually, I have a surprise for you.

24:43.320 --> 24:44.760
Oh, shit!

24:46.200 --> 24:48.160
A surprise, really?

24:48.160 --> 24:49.960
What do you think of this?

24:49.960 --> 24:52.000
PFFFRRRRTTT!

25:00.480 --> 25:03.880
Look, Cathy, I've been trying
to ask you something all week.

25:03.880 --> 25:07.440
I know, it's difficult to get
some privacy in this house.

25:07.440 --> 25:09.920
But we're alone now, Thomas,
so what is it?

25:10.960 --> 25:12.360
Wait...

25:13.560 --> 25:15.400
Does this turn you on?

25:15.400 --> 25:17.960
PFFFRRRTTTT!

25:22.960 --> 25:25.680
Well, not really, no.
Go on, Thomas.

25:26.920 --> 25:29.560
Well, Cathy,
love is a strange thing.

25:29.560 --> 25:30.600
Yes, it is.

25:30.600 --> 25:32.640
PFFFRRRTTT!

25:32.640 --> 25:36.280
And one can never foresee
who or what we will love.

25:36.280 --> 25:37.920
No, we can't, Thomas.

25:37.920 --> 25:42.840
I mean, I never dreamt I'd meet
anyone as warm and as gentle as you.

25:42.840 --> 25:45.520
Hiya! Oh, piss off, Rory!

25:46.880 --> 25:48.960
Go on, Thomas, warm and gentle is me.

25:48.960 --> 25:50.680
PFFFRRRTTT!

25:50.680 --> 25:52.560
Well, to get to the point, Cathy,

25:52.560 --> 25:56.400
I've been offered a wonderful
position in a university in America.

25:56.400 --> 25:57.880
That's fantastic.

25:57.880 --> 25:59.320
And I was wondering...

26:01.000 --> 26:03.320
Yes? Will you...m...

26:03.320 --> 26:05.280
mind my dog for me?

26:05.280 --> 26:10.040
Oh, Thomas, I've never even
considered marriage and now...

26:12.400 --> 26:13.840
Your dog?

26:13.840 --> 26:15.600
Yes, just for a year.

26:15.600 --> 26:20.400
Thomas, I have been a loyal
and faithful girlfriend.

26:20.400 --> 26:22.640
PFFFRRRTTT!

26:24.320 --> 26:27.120
I am an attractive
and intelligent woman.

26:27.120 --> 26:29.360
PFFFRRRTTT!

26:29.360 --> 26:32.360
With more to offer than any
man knows.

26:32.360 --> 26:34.040
PFFFRRRTTT!

26:35.600 --> 26:40.520
For the last year, I have been
a loving and caring partner...

26:40.520 --> 26:41.960
PFFFRRRTTT!

26:41.960 --> 26:47.000
And now you want me
to mind your dog?!

26:47.000 --> 26:48.680
I'm not so sure now.

26:51.240 --> 26:54.320
Thomas, good luck in America.

26:54.320 --> 26:56.600
And as for your dog?

26:56.600 --> 27:01.960
Why don't you cover him in butter
and shove him up your arse!

27:05.680 --> 27:08.000
PFFRRTT! PFFRRTT! PFFRRTT!

27:09.080 --> 27:10.120
Now get out!

27:14.480 --> 27:16.760
PFFFRRRTTT!

27:27.040 --> 27:29.400
Well, it's been a hectic week.

27:29.400 --> 27:32.240
But you know, not everything
has to be a feckin' drama.

27:32.240 --> 27:34.720
Cathy's heart is broken,
but that can be fixed.

27:34.720 --> 27:37.560
And Rory did damage the car
for the driving school,

27:37.560 --> 27:39.120
but that can be fixed.

27:39.120 --> 27:43.320
You'd be surprised what can be fixed
with a little love and tender care.

27:44.680 --> 27:46.320
And a puncture repair outfit.

27:46.320 --> 27:48.840
SHE CACKLES

27:50.680 --> 27:53.840
OK, I've got to stop...
stop the fuckin' thing! Stop it!

27:55.560 --> 27:57.680
Stop it! Good night!

28:00.680 --> 28:04.880
# Say hello to the queen
of Dublin town

28:05.880 --> 28:10.520
# As the best mum of all
She wears the crown

28:11.960 --> 28:15.040
# Mother hen watching all her chicks

28:15.040 --> 28:17.920
# Sassy old lady full of tricks

28:17.920 --> 28:23.560
# It's a safe bet
she'd never let life get her down

28:23.560 --> 28:26.440
# She's Mrs Brown

28:26.440 --> 28:29.440
# That's Mrs Brown

28:29.440 --> 28:32.120
# Oh, Mrs Brown. #
