00:01.069 --> 00:03.337
You're facing your fears
with The Exorcist.

-Unclean spirit!
-In the name of God!

00:11.979 --> 00:14.415
I can make a difference, Alfred.
I know I can.

00:14.448 --> 00:15.783
Only on Fox.

00:19.153 --> 00:20.854
-Previously on The Exorcist...
-Who's Grace?

00:20.888 --> 00:23.524
GRACE:
You should be careful, Daddy.

00:24.358 --> 00:26.694
(gasps, screams)

00:29.130 --> 00:30.431
Anybody home?

00:30.464 --> 00:33.301
TOMAS: Have you noticed
anything unusual?

00:33.334 --> 00:34.835
If we could get
our hands on a demon

00:34.868 --> 00:37.471
with that level of
influence and power...

00:37.505 --> 00:38.839
-(groaning)
-(panting)

00:38.872 --> 00:40.508
There's something wrong
with me, Rose.

00:40.541 --> 00:42.176
You know you can
tell me anything.

00:53.554 --> 00:55.923
*

00:55.956 --> 00:57.925
Nikki.

00:57.958 --> 01:00.861
Hello, Andy.

01:06.867 --> 01:08.869
You've made quite a mess.

01:20.114 --> 01:22.550
This had potential.

01:22.583 --> 01:25.619
But I can start over.

01:30.458 --> 01:32.693
Where's Grace?

01:32.726 --> 01:35.095
You sent her away.

01:38.098 --> 01:41.902
But you don't need her anymore.

01:41.935 --> 01:44.538
Now you have me.

01:44.572 --> 01:46.440
This isn't real.

01:46.474 --> 01:48.142
This, uh...

01:48.176 --> 01:49.543
This isn't real.

01:49.577 --> 01:51.879
This...

02:06.160 --> 02:08.796
Do I feel real?

02:11.899 --> 02:14.868
HARPER:
Where'd they take Truck?

02:14.902 --> 02:16.937
SHELBY:
To a psychiatric ward,

02:16.970 --> 02:18.472
for kids.

02:18.506 --> 02:20.608
For how long?

02:20.641 --> 02:22.310
I don't know.

02:22.343 --> 02:24.945
Till he's ready
to come home, I guess.

02:24.978 --> 02:27.215
CALEB: He's not coming home.
He's going straight to juvie.

02:27.248 --> 02:28.582
COLLEEN:
Caleb.

02:28.616 --> 02:29.983
SHELBY: Look, Andy's gonna
figure something out.

02:30.017 --> 02:32.453
Sure about that?

02:35.856 --> 02:38.359
WOMAN (whispers):
Harper.

02:47.401 --> 02:48.836
COLLEEN:
Come on, Harper. Don't dawdle.

02:48.869 --> 02:50.838
Andy's expecting you all home.

02:54.675 --> 02:56.677
WOMAN (whispers):
Harper.

02:58.946 --> 03:01.615
I thought you'd be
happy to see me.

03:03.584 --> 03:06.354
A-Are you scared?

03:06.387 --> 03:08.656
No.

03:08.689 --> 03:11.091
Then why do you keep
pulling away,

03:11.124 --> 03:14.362
when this is everything
you've ever wanted?

03:16.364 --> 03:18.799
I think I'm losing my mind.

03:18.832 --> 03:20.734
(whispering):
Shh.

03:21.735 --> 03:23.837
Shh.

03:23.871 --> 03:26.039
It's okay.

03:26.073 --> 03:28.075
It's me.

03:29.076 --> 03:31.679
It's me.

03:31.712 --> 03:33.514
COLLEEN (in distance):
Andy, you in here?

03:33.547 --> 03:35.716
I got the kids.

03:37.751 --> 03:40.754
-I have to...
-Of course you do.

03:42.756 --> 03:44.258
Go.

03:44.292 --> 03:48.028
You left me.

03:48.061 --> 03:49.530
How could you leave me?

03:49.563 --> 03:53.834
Hey, you don't
have to worry anymore.

03:56.904 --> 04:00.274
I will never leave you again.

04:02.075 --> 04:04.244
*

04:27.601 --> 04:29.603
*

05:04.805 --> 05:06.807
*

05:14.982 --> 05:17.585
Where the hell have you been?
I've been waiting for hours.

05:17.618 --> 05:19.687
There is no time to waste.
Last night, in the house...

05:19.720 --> 05:21.121
You went back?

05:21.154 --> 05:22.790
I specifically
told you not to...

05:22.823 --> 05:25.292
I know what you told me,
but they're in danger.

05:25.325 --> 05:28.462
What did you see?

05:33.100 --> 05:37.070
There was a presence
in the house.

05:37.104 --> 05:39.072
I could feel it.

05:42.042 --> 05:47.280
I went upstairs to the attic.
It is... some studio.

05:47.314 --> 05:50.751
Andy's wife, she was a painter
before she killed herself.

05:56.524 --> 05:58.025
MARCUS:
Tomas...

05:58.058 --> 05:59.960
(gun racks, gunshot)

05:59.993 --> 06:01.194
Tomas.

06:01.995 --> 06:03.397
(screams)

06:04.565 --> 06:06.033
Tomas.

06:06.066 --> 06:08.402
Tomas, look at me.
Focus on me.

06:11.038 --> 06:13.507
Just stay here. Tomas.

06:13.541 --> 06:15.709
You okay?

06:15.743 --> 06:18.178
(Tomas panting)

06:20.247 --> 06:22.049
Just tell me.

06:22.082 --> 06:23.851
Tell me what you saw.

06:28.522 --> 06:31.892
And in the attic,
I found a rock.

06:33.894 --> 06:36.396
When I touched it, I...

06:36.430 --> 06:38.398
I saw death.

06:39.433 --> 06:42.135
Children.

06:42.169 --> 06:44.037
So many of them.

06:44.071 --> 06:47.908
All of them killed
by someone they loved.

06:50.744 --> 06:54.347
Who knows how long these demons
have been on those islands?

06:54.381 --> 06:56.850
Hundreds of years, thousands.

06:56.884 --> 06:58.251
Using them as...

06:58.285 --> 07:00.287
Hunting grounds.

07:01.922 --> 07:04.792
ROSE:
How are you doing?

07:04.825 --> 07:06.927
TRUCK:
I don't like it here.

07:09.597 --> 07:12.900
The other kids are scary...

07:12.933 --> 07:16.604
and the pills make me sleepy
all the time.

07:16.637 --> 07:18.606
When can I come home?

07:18.639 --> 07:21.942
We're-we're looking into
options for you.

07:21.975 --> 07:23.911
Hopefully, we'll know soon.

07:23.944 --> 07:26.079
Does Verity hate me?

07:26.113 --> 07:29.783
No. No, no, she doesn't.

07:29.817 --> 07:32.953
Do you hate me?

07:33.987 --> 07:36.289
What?

07:36.323 --> 07:38.425
No, of course not, buddy.

07:38.458 --> 07:41.829
Well, can you tell Verity
that I'm real sorry?

07:41.862 --> 07:45.599
I-I... I-I didn't want
to hurt her.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.803
She made me.

07:49.837 --> 07:51.805
Who made you?

07:54.441 --> 07:56.977
The person in my head.

08:01.515 --> 08:03.483
He's got an evaluation now.

08:03.517 --> 08:07.420
I don't want to be here.
I want to go home.

08:07.454 --> 08:08.656
Andy?

08:11.759 --> 08:14.728
Just try to hang in there. Okay?

08:17.631 --> 08:19.600
Come on.

08:22.970 --> 08:26.740
Don't hate me, Andy.
Please don't hate me.

08:31.144 --> 08:33.480
ROSE: The detention order
will expire in a couple of days,

08:33.513 --> 08:35.182
but I have
some other options for

08:35.215 --> 08:36.984
some short-term facilities
that can take him.

08:37.017 --> 08:40.520
They have beds dedicated to kids
with special needs like Truck.

08:40.554 --> 08:43.156
-What about the others?
-What do you mean?

08:43.190 --> 08:45.659
Verity. Shelby. Caleb. Harper.

08:45.693 --> 08:48.161
You and I both know there's
no way my home stays open,

08:48.195 --> 08:49.963
not after an incident like this.

08:49.997 --> 08:52.900
Well, you know what?
No decision has been made yet,

08:52.933 --> 08:54.802
but I can tell you
that kind of negative thinking

08:54.835 --> 08:56.303
isn't going to help us
resolve the situation.

08:56.336 --> 08:57.738
I don't think
I'm being negative.

08:57.771 --> 09:00.741
I think I'm seeing things
pretty clearly.

09:08.582 --> 09:11.585
Truck said something in his head
made him do it.

09:14.254 --> 09:16.256
Was it you?

09:19.492 --> 09:21.494
NICOLE:
I didn't do anything, Andy.

09:23.764 --> 09:27.234
These kids are the way they are.

09:27.267 --> 09:29.269
Sometimes they're unfixable.

09:31.304 --> 09:34.374
I thought I could...

09:34.407 --> 09:37.611
handle it after I lost you.

09:40.447 --> 09:42.650
-That I could protect them.
-You did.

09:42.683 --> 09:44.151
No.

09:44.184 --> 09:46.153
I tried.

09:48.155 --> 09:50.157
I tried so hard.

09:52.826 --> 09:55.829
In the end,
I just let everyone down.

09:59.099 --> 10:01.401
I just couldn't do it alone.

10:01.434 --> 10:05.405
Hey. You're not alone.

10:05.438 --> 10:07.941
Not anymore.

10:11.078 --> 10:14.147
We won't let them tear us apart.

10:23.290 --> 10:26.293
*

10:43.911 --> 10:45.846
*

10:58.759 --> 11:01.161
You know how Truck got his name?

11:01.194 --> 11:03.797
'Cause he likes trucks?

11:03.831 --> 11:07.134
When he first got here, he had
all of his stuff in this trunk.

11:07.167 --> 11:09.469
So, Verity started
calling him "Trunk Boy."

11:09.502 --> 11:14.708
But he thought she was
calling him "Truck Boy,"

11:14.742 --> 11:17.577
and he liked it.

11:17.610 --> 11:20.680
So, we called him "Truck Boy"
for a while, and...

11:20.714 --> 11:22.649
and, uh...

11:22.682 --> 11:25.685
then it was just "Truck."

11:29.689 --> 11:32.425
You know the story you told me?

11:32.459 --> 11:34.027
About the Island Witch?

11:34.061 --> 11:36.696
Is she real?

11:36.730 --> 11:38.298
You mean, like, a real person?

11:38.331 --> 11:39.499
Yeah.

11:39.532 --> 11:42.169
Last night, in the woods,

11:42.202 --> 11:45.438
I thought I saw someone.

11:45.472 --> 11:47.274
Hey, Andy.

11:47.307 --> 11:50.010
You always know it's me,
don't you?

11:50.043 --> 11:52.445
Is Truck okay?

11:52.479 --> 11:55.348
He's fine.

11:55.382 --> 11:57.617
What are you two doing?

11:57.650 --> 12:01.154
We're gonna send Truck
some of his favorite toys.

12:01.188 --> 12:04.191
Dinner's in a few hours.

12:11.464 --> 12:13.166
ROSE:
This is a really bad time.

12:13.200 --> 12:15.268
-MARCUS: Why is that then?
-ROSE: We had to admit Truck

12:15.302 --> 12:16.904
into a facility last night.

12:16.937 --> 12:18.371
There was an incident.

12:18.405 --> 12:21.108
Was it violent?

12:21.141 --> 12:22.742
He attacked Verity.

12:22.776 --> 12:26.246
She's a little shaken,
but she's fine.

12:26.279 --> 12:28.315
You know who we are.
You know what we do.

12:28.348 --> 12:30.517
We believe there's something
dangerous at work here.

12:30.550 --> 12:33.353
Yeah, your partner
has implied as much.

12:33.386 --> 12:35.856
Although he used
much less ominous terms.

12:35.889 --> 12:37.757
Yeah, well, sometimes, ominous
terms are the most appropriate.

12:37.791 --> 12:40.227
You ignore them, you're risking
the lives of all these children.

12:40.260 --> 12:41.995
Are you trying to scare me now?

12:42.029 --> 12:44.697
You're scared already.

12:47.300 --> 12:51.004
You've asked me if I've noticed
anything unusual.

12:51.038 --> 12:53.406
Anyone acting out of character.

12:53.440 --> 12:54.741
Have you?

12:54.774 --> 12:57.277
Everyone's just been
so stressed,

12:57.310 --> 12:59.746
especially Andy...

12:59.779 --> 13:01.915
That's how it works its way in.

13:03.817 --> 13:08.255
It seeks vulnerability, uh,
emotional trauma.

13:08.288 --> 13:10.557
And by "it," you mean a...

13:10.590 --> 13:12.092
MARCUS:
A demon.

13:12.125 --> 13:14.561
One that targets families
and coerces parents

13:14.594 --> 13:16.663
into murdering
their own children.

13:19.132 --> 13:20.267
(laughs softly)

13:20.300 --> 13:21.568
And you think, what?

13:21.601 --> 13:23.670
It's-it's picked this family?

13:26.840 --> 13:28.909
Let us talk to Andy.

13:28.942 --> 13:31.778
Just talk.

13:31.811 --> 13:36.216
We need to spend some time with
him, uh, observe his behavior.

13:36.249 --> 13:38.051
Like you did with Harper?

13:38.085 --> 13:39.486
Exactly.

13:39.519 --> 13:41.989
We need confirmation
before we can proceed.

13:44.457 --> 13:47.660
With an exorcism?

13:47.694 --> 13:51.498
If we're wrong, all's well,
you'll never see us again.

13:51.531 --> 13:56.136
But if we're right,
we can do something about it.

14:03.843 --> 14:05.378
(knife chopping)

14:10.350 --> 14:11.851
Did you see Truck?

14:14.821 --> 14:16.489
I did.

14:16.523 --> 14:19.226
How did he seem?

14:19.259 --> 14:20.693
Drugged.

14:22.695 --> 14:24.664
VERITY:
You know what I mean.

14:24.697 --> 14:26.900
Did he say anything?

14:26.934 --> 14:29.369
Not really, no.
(sniffs)

14:31.704 --> 14:34.141
I'm not gonna press charges
against him,

14:34.174 --> 14:36.576
if that's what's keeping him
from coming home.

14:36.609 --> 14:38.946
He's not coming home, Verity.

14:38.979 --> 14:41.381
Truck is a disturbed kid.

14:41.414 --> 14:44.384
I thought I could help him,
but it's pretty clear

14:44.417 --> 14:47.220
he needs more
than I'm capable of providing.

14:47.254 --> 14:50.190
They'll find
a good place for him.

14:50.223 --> 14:52.993
So how about we focus
on who's left?

14:53.026 --> 14:55.695
We're still a family.

15:10.443 --> 15:12.479
ROSE (in distance):
Please, make yourselves at home.

15:12.512 --> 15:13.713
MARCUS:
Thank you.

15:22.689 --> 15:24.657
This is a surprise.

15:24.691 --> 15:28.028
ROSE: Yeah, they are
moving on tomorrow.

15:28.061 --> 15:30.697
We stopped in
to say our good-byes.

15:30.730 --> 15:33.466
I've asked them
to stay for dinner tonight.

15:33.500 --> 15:36.036
I hope that's okay?

15:36.069 --> 15:39.072
The more, the merrier.

15:42.976 --> 15:45.845
I'm just finishing up
a few things in the kitchen.

15:45.878 --> 15:48.115
Make yourselves at home.

15:53.920 --> 15:55.922
NICOLE:
Easy, love.

15:57.957 --> 16:00.127
Why would she bring them here?

16:00.160 --> 16:02.062
Isn't it obvious?

16:02.095 --> 16:04.597
She wants them to tear us apart.

16:04.631 --> 16:07.267
What should I do?

16:07.300 --> 16:10.470
What you've always done.

16:10.503 --> 16:13.706
Protect this family.

16:13.740 --> 16:15.975
Just get through this evening.

16:16.009 --> 16:17.977
After they've gone,

16:18.011 --> 16:21.114
we'll start putting this house
back together again.

16:21.148 --> 16:24.117
Yes.

16:26.519 --> 16:29.922
I think that's what they call
"happily ever after."

16:29.956 --> 16:31.524
(laughs softly)

16:56.983 --> 16:58.818
NURSE:
How are you feeling today?

16:58.851 --> 17:00.620
Better, I hope?

17:00.653 --> 17:02.522
(raspy breathing)

17:02.555 --> 17:05.058
I'll be back in a bit
to check on you.

17:10.663 --> 17:11.831
Apologies.

17:11.864 --> 17:14.534
(muffled screaming)

17:23.343 --> 17:25.345
(door closes)

17:33.253 --> 17:35.788
Father Bennett.

17:39.559 --> 17:42.028
(demonic voice):
I could smell you coming.

17:52.405 --> 17:55.342
Mac and cheese, grilled cheese,
Havarti and gruyere,

17:55.375 --> 17:56.709
-tomato bisque.
-VERITY: Yes.

17:56.743 --> 17:58.511
-Wow. -CALEB: Smells good.
-ROSE: Doesn't it look great?

17:58.545 --> 17:59.512
-Enjoy.
-HARPER: Amazing.

17:59.546 --> 18:01.381
-Let's start.
-ANDY: Let's eat.

18:01.414 --> 18:03.550
-CALEB: I'm hungry.
-What about grace?

18:05.418 --> 18:07.019
Right.

18:07.053 --> 18:09.556
Grace, of course.

18:09.589 --> 18:12.091
Uh, would you like
to do the honors, Father?

18:13.293 --> 18:15.295
Sure.

18:17.330 --> 18:20.467
Bless us, O Lord,
and these Thy gifts,

18:20.500 --> 18:23.069
which we are about to receive
from Thy bounty...

18:23.102 --> 18:24.871
Dog thy bounty hunter.

18:24.904 --> 18:26.539
TOMAS: We give thanks
to Andy for this meal,

18:26.573 --> 18:28.241
and for being
such a generous host.

18:28.275 --> 18:30.310
Please give strength to him
and his family

18:30.343 --> 18:32.212
during these difficult times.

18:32.245 --> 18:34.414
Through Christ our Lord, amen.

18:34.447 --> 18:37.417
-Amen.
-Ramen.

18:37.450 --> 18:38.918
(Tomas clears throat)

18:40.553 --> 18:42.522
Looks delicious.

18:46.259 --> 18:49.128
So, is this, like, a thing now?

18:49.162 --> 18:51.764
Random priests showing up
for no reason?

18:51.798 --> 18:53.566
No, we're here to say good-bye,

18:53.600 --> 18:57.404
and thank you
for what you've done for Harper.

18:57.437 --> 18:59.272
(laughs softly)

18:59.306 --> 19:01.140
Where are you headed next?

19:01.174 --> 19:03.075
Wherever the work takes us.

19:03.109 --> 19:04.744
What kind of work is that?
You two don't strike me

19:04.777 --> 19:06.779
as the missionary types.

19:06.813 --> 19:08.915
They're exorcists.

19:15.121 --> 19:16.823
For real?

19:16.856 --> 19:20.993
It's 'cause my mom thought
I had a demon in me.

19:21.027 --> 19:22.662
She was crazy.

19:22.695 --> 19:24.664
Is that true?

19:24.697 --> 19:26.199
Yes.

19:26.233 --> 19:28.301
We're exorcists.

19:28.335 --> 19:31.638
So, you... fight demons.

19:31.671 --> 19:33.273
On occasion.

19:33.306 --> 19:35.742
(scoffs)

19:35.775 --> 19:38.645
Sorry, I don't mean
any disrespect.

19:38.678 --> 19:41.314
The whole thing just sounds
a little 14th century.

19:41.348 --> 19:43.650
Not a believer, I take it?

19:43.683 --> 19:46.619
I'm a psychologist.

19:46.653 --> 19:48.588
I believe the human brain

19:48.621 --> 19:52.091
is a wonderful and complicated
piece of machinery.

19:52.124 --> 19:53.893
And that primitive civilizations

19:53.926 --> 19:56.429
struggled to understand
how that machine worked,

19:56.463 --> 19:59.031
so they came up with metaphors

19:59.065 --> 20:01.801
to explain concepts
that were just out of reach.

20:01.834 --> 20:04.504
You know, I used to think
the exact same thing.

20:04.537 --> 20:05.972
(chuckles)

20:06.005 --> 20:08.007
And what changed your mind?

20:08.040 --> 20:11.010
I saw a demon for myself.

20:11.043 --> 20:13.012
Well, that's convenient for you.

20:14.881 --> 20:16.215
The rest of us
just see the damage

20:16.249 --> 20:18.551
caused by your belief system.

20:18.585 --> 20:20.987
Isn't that the basis
for the "conversion therapy"

20:21.020 --> 20:22.855
that your parents
sent you to, Verity?

20:22.889 --> 20:24.524
"Exorcise your sins"?

20:24.557 --> 20:27.527
"Pray the gay away"?

20:27.560 --> 20:29.529
Don't drag me into this.

20:29.562 --> 20:30.863
Do you think
that my daughter has a demon

20:30.897 --> 20:32.599
in her, Father Tomas?

20:32.632 --> 20:36.035
Because some of your colleagues
in the Church certainly did.

20:36.068 --> 20:38.838
They were wrong.

20:38.871 --> 20:40.540
And I am sorry.

20:42.775 --> 20:45.745
Perhaps we should just leave
your daughter out of this.

20:45.778 --> 20:46.979
Yes.

20:47.013 --> 20:48.781
I agree.

20:50.049 --> 20:51.418
Of course. I'm sorry, Verity.

20:51.451 --> 20:52.919
I shouldn't have done that.

20:52.952 --> 20:56.556
I guess I'm feeling
a little overprotective.

20:56.589 --> 20:59.058
I just want to make sure
that this house remains

20:59.091 --> 21:01.494
a safe space for my children.

21:01.528 --> 21:03.696
Yeah, of course.

21:03.730 --> 21:06.032
We only want the same thing.

21:10.903 --> 21:12.739
MARIA:
Poor Maria Walters.

21:12.772 --> 21:17.310
All that wealth and power,
and yet...

21:17.344 --> 21:21.948
we could smell
the cancer inside.

21:21.981 --> 21:24.216
She's terminal now.

21:24.250 --> 21:25.718
Worthless.

21:25.752 --> 21:28.120
Sounds like you found
the perfect match, then.

21:28.154 --> 21:30.957
The conspiracy
inside the Church.

21:30.990 --> 21:33.826
You're going to give us names.

21:33.860 --> 21:35.027
Am I?

21:35.061 --> 21:37.163
You were a match for me.

21:37.196 --> 21:41.368
It's not too late
to change your mind, Father.

21:41.401 --> 21:43.370
And why would I do that?

21:43.403 --> 21:45.905
Because you've lost the war.

21:45.938 --> 21:48.441
The Office of Exorcism is gone.

21:48.475 --> 21:53.212
There's very few
of your kind still left.

21:54.981 --> 21:57.850
You should tell us
what we need to know.

22:00.753 --> 22:03.823
I have nothing for you.

22:03.856 --> 22:06.292
So sorry.

22:07.794 --> 22:11.864
The conspiracy has little use

22:11.898 --> 22:13.466
for a rotting socialite.

22:13.500 --> 22:16.202
They abandoned me
months ago. Oh.

22:19.171 --> 22:21.340
(Maria whimpering)

22:21.374 --> 22:24.076
Torture, is it?

22:24.110 --> 22:26.846
(panting)

22:26.879 --> 22:29.048
(laughs softly)

22:31.183 --> 22:34.587
(demonic voice):
How terribly exciting.

22:34.621 --> 22:36.589
(laughs)

22:38.525 --> 22:40.527
Hey, how you doing, sunshine?

22:41.894 --> 22:45.264
Everyone's sad.

22:45.297 --> 22:46.666
I miss Truck.

22:46.699 --> 22:47.967
Yeah.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.235
Of course you do.

22:51.337 --> 22:53.339
Hey, I've got
a question for you.

22:55.041 --> 22:57.243
Have you seen anything...

22:57.276 --> 22:59.679
unusual around the house?

22:59.712 --> 23:02.014
You can tell me.

23:02.048 --> 23:04.316
No one's gonna get in
any trouble, I promise you.

23:08.421 --> 23:10.122
Not in the house.

23:10.156 --> 23:12.925
But...

23:12.959 --> 23:14.761
last night...

23:14.794 --> 23:16.429
in the woods...

23:16.463 --> 23:17.864
What did you see?

23:17.897 --> 23:20.032
I didn't see anything.

23:23.269 --> 23:25.805
I heard something.

23:25.838 --> 23:28.074
A voice.

23:28.107 --> 23:30.076
What did it say?

23:30.109 --> 23:31.544
HARPER:
My name.

23:33.580 --> 23:36.182
Do you think
it's the Island Witch?

23:38.184 --> 23:40.920
I've got it on good authority

23:40.953 --> 23:43.956
there's no such thing
as Island Witches. (chuckles)

23:46.125 --> 23:47.359
(chuckles softly)

23:47.393 --> 23:49.996
Just your little old
imagination.

23:51.230 --> 23:52.732
ANDY:
You started an exorcism

23:52.765 --> 23:56.636
on Harper, even though
she wasn't possessed?

23:56.669 --> 23:57.937
Yes. I...

23:57.970 --> 23:59.906
I made a hasty judgment.

23:59.939 --> 24:03.876
Uh, usually, we have more time
to confirm a demon's presence.

24:03.910 --> 24:07.780
But the fact remains,
you were wrong.

24:10.282 --> 24:13.520
You said you typically
take measures

24:13.553 --> 24:16.088
to confirm a demon's presence?

24:16.122 --> 24:18.190
We look for certain signs.

24:18.224 --> 24:20.226
Uh... aversion to the sacred.

24:20.259 --> 24:24.096
Knowledge the possessed person
is incapable of having.

24:24.130 --> 24:28.134
Also, the ability to speak
a language or languages

24:28.167 --> 24:29.569
-that they don't know.
-ANDY: Hmm.

24:29.602 --> 24:32.471
That's funny,
I always picture, um...

24:32.505 --> 24:36.308
spinning heads
and levitating bodies.

24:36.342 --> 24:38.444
(laughs): Sorry.

24:38.477 --> 24:40.947
No, only in some cases,

24:40.980 --> 24:43.015
and only at the end.

24:43.049 --> 24:46.553
When it starts, possession's
very subtle, little things--

24:46.586 --> 24:48.655
changes in demeanor...

24:50.690 --> 24:52.859
...loss of control.

24:52.892 --> 24:54.493
Ah.

24:54.527 --> 24:56.963
That must make your job
difficult.

24:56.996 --> 24:59.599
Mm... not really.

24:59.632 --> 25:02.334
Sooner or later, the demon
always makes a mistake.

25:06.005 --> 25:07.640
When did you start
fostering kids?

25:07.674 --> 25:09.909
Oh, it's hard to believe,

25:09.942 --> 25:13.112
but I-I guess it's been
about six years now.

25:13.145 --> 25:14.313
Was it difficult?

25:14.346 --> 25:15.615
Was what difficult?

25:15.648 --> 25:17.817
When you first took in the kids.

25:21.187 --> 25:22.655
It was an adjustment.

25:22.689 --> 25:24.791
You know, you add three kids
in a span of a year...

25:24.824 --> 25:28.761
And it's harder knowing
they're not really yours.

25:31.363 --> 25:35.001
They're ours the second
they walk through that door.

25:35.034 --> 25:36.969
We always made sure
they knew that.

25:37.003 --> 25:38.137
We?

25:38.170 --> 25:40.973
Nikki and I.

25:41.007 --> 25:43.109
We made the decision together
to become parents.

25:43.142 --> 25:45.377
What, 'cause you couldn't have
kids of your own?

25:50.516 --> 25:52.952
No.

25:52.985 --> 25:55.955
Because we worked with
abused kids every single day,

25:55.988 --> 25:58.658
and we saw that there weren't
enough homes to go around.

25:58.691 --> 26:01.027
Oh, so... you love them

26:01.060 --> 26:03.129
like they're your own
flesh and blood?

26:03.162 --> 26:04.697
Of course we do.

26:04.731 --> 26:07.499
Even the one you abandoned
to psychiatric care?

26:07.533 --> 26:09.869
Truck needed help
that we couldn't provide.

26:09.902 --> 26:11.070
What the hell is this?

26:11.103 --> 26:12.972
Hey, talk to me, Andy, not her.

26:13.005 --> 26:14.440
I'm talking to you.

26:14.473 --> 26:17.076
-And I want you out...
-NICOLE: Careful, now.

26:26.352 --> 26:28.855
Just because I brought in
outside help

26:28.888 --> 26:30.422
doesn't mean
I don't care, Mr. Keane.

26:33.059 --> 26:35.895
-Anyone else for a refill?
-Mm. -ROSE: Yes, please.

26:38.965 --> 26:40.499
What are you doing?

26:40.532 --> 26:42.334
I didn't ask you here
to question his parenting.

26:42.368 --> 26:45.337
We are trying to provoke
an emotional response.

26:45.371 --> 26:47.373
Well, you got one.

26:47.406 --> 26:49.275
You force the possessed
to lose control,

26:49.308 --> 26:51.778
you force the demon to manifest.

26:51.811 --> 26:53.145
Yeah, and if you're wrong,

26:53.179 --> 26:54.814
then you're just attacking
an innocent man.

26:54.847 --> 26:57.316
That's a chance
I'm willing to take.

26:59.251 --> 27:00.319
Mr. Keane?

27:00.352 --> 27:01.587
Thanks.

27:03.656 --> 27:04.623
Rose?

27:04.657 --> 27:05.825
Yes, please.

27:07.994 --> 27:09.662
Father?

27:09.696 --> 27:10.930
Thank you.

27:24.944 --> 27:26.245
MARCUS (quietly):
You all right?

27:31.417 --> 27:33.419
Yes.

27:35.021 --> 27:36.789
Everything okay?

27:38.925 --> 27:41.127
Yes, uh...

27:41.160 --> 27:43.462
Excuse me.

27:48.067 --> 27:52.204
You know, I actually do admire
what you've done here.

27:55.207 --> 27:57.944
I lost my parents
at a young age, and...

27:57.977 --> 28:00.947
the system can be cruel.

28:00.980 --> 28:02.949
You've sacrificed a lot
for these kids.

28:02.982 --> 28:04.851
Part of being a parent.

28:04.884 --> 28:06.618
Ever wonder how your life
would have turned out

28:06.652 --> 28:07.987
if you hadn't taken them in?

28:08.020 --> 28:09.321
No, but I'm wondering why

28:09.355 --> 28:10.890
you're asking me
these questions.

28:10.923 --> 28:16.195
In casa di calzolaio
non si hanno scarpe.

28:16.228 --> 28:17.964
Is that Italian?

28:17.997 --> 28:20.666
"In the house of the shoemaker,
there are no shoes."

28:20.699 --> 28:22.334
Meaning what?

28:22.368 --> 28:25.772
Did you seek counseling
after your wife died?

28:32.912 --> 28:35.314
Shh.

28:35.347 --> 28:39.118
How I grieved is absolutely none
of your business.

28:39.151 --> 28:40.686
What about the kids?

28:40.719 --> 28:42.488
What about them?

28:42.521 --> 28:44.924
They loved Nicole, didn't they?

28:48.494 --> 28:50.096
Of course they did.

28:51.931 --> 28:53.632
Bunch of kids,
the middle of nowhere,

28:53.665 --> 28:56.435
no one to talk to.

28:56.468 --> 28:59.371
Must have been difficult,
dealing with your grief.

28:59.405 --> 29:01.407
We had each other.

29:04.676 --> 29:07.679
I found this upstairs.

29:07.713 --> 29:10.016
It's a funny thing
to keep around,

29:10.049 --> 29:12.551
an old rock.

29:15.121 --> 29:16.956
What's its significance?

29:21.894 --> 29:25.264
There's no significance.

29:25.297 --> 29:27.867
It's just a rock.

29:30.136 --> 29:32.571
Why do you keep
staring at it, then?

29:35.374 --> 29:38.044
Why do you keep asking me
these questions?

29:38.077 --> 29:40.079
Do you blame yourself
for your wife's death?

29:40.112 --> 29:41.413
What?

29:41.447 --> 29:42.781
MARCUS: Well, there must
have been warning signs.

29:42.815 --> 29:44.016
Okay, that's enough.

29:44.050 --> 29:45.251
Which means
either you missed them

29:45.284 --> 29:46.485
(chuckling):
or you ignored them.

29:47.453 --> 29:50.289
TOMAS:
Andy, sit down.

29:50.322 --> 29:52.291
Sit.

29:52.324 --> 29:54.693
Down.

29:54.726 --> 29:57.196
I want you out of my house.

29:57.229 --> 29:58.931
That's not gonna happen.

29:58.965 --> 30:00.967
Yes, it is.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.769
This is not what I agreed to.

30:06.172 --> 30:07.673
You knew about this?

30:07.706 --> 30:09.808
I told you.
She put them up to this.

30:09.842 --> 30:11.177
She's been against us
from the beginning.

30:11.210 --> 30:13.512
You came to me
with your concerns

30:13.545 --> 30:14.981
and I went along with it.

30:15.014 --> 30:16.348
I trusted you.

30:16.382 --> 30:18.450
I invited you in
for the sake of the kids.

30:18.484 --> 30:21.253
Because if there was
just a chance...

30:21.287 --> 30:22.621
I'm not going to sit here

30:22.654 --> 30:24.656
and watch you attack
a grieving father.

30:27.793 --> 30:30.997
Fight it.

30:31.030 --> 30:34.166
If you care
about your children...

30:34.200 --> 30:36.002
If you want to keep them safe...

30:36.035 --> 30:41.040
Please, Andy, fight it.

30:46.378 --> 30:47.779
I'm calling the police.

30:47.813 --> 30:51.283
That won't be necessary.

30:51.317 --> 30:53.152
We're leaving.

30:53.185 --> 30:54.520
Marcus...

30:56.388 --> 30:58.390
Marcus.

31:21.513 --> 31:22.681
-MARCUS: We can't leave them.
-TOMAS: Of course not,

31:22.714 --> 31:23.950
but we have to go.
If we're stuck

31:23.983 --> 31:26.552
in the back of a police car,
they have no chance.

31:26.585 --> 31:27.987
What now?

31:28.020 --> 31:29.388
We circle back,
keep an eye on the house,

31:29.421 --> 31:31.223
wait till the lights go out,
then we take him by force.

31:31.257 --> 31:32.959
He won't leave without a fight.

31:32.992 --> 31:35.861
Just get him away from the kids,
that's all that matters.

31:35.894 --> 31:38.464
Yeah.

31:38.497 --> 31:42.501
You saw something back there,
when you froze up.

31:42.534 --> 31:44.436
Another echo.

31:46.372 --> 31:47.406
You were right.

31:47.439 --> 31:49.708
I should have listened to you.

31:51.610 --> 31:53.946
These visions,
they're not a gift.

31:56.848 --> 31:58.850
They're a curse.

31:58.884 --> 32:02.254
Your curse led us
to this family.

32:02.288 --> 32:05.457
If it weren't for you, everyone
in that house would be dead.

32:06.892 --> 32:10.062
You have no idea what it's like.

32:10.096 --> 32:11.230
Then tell me.

32:11.263 --> 32:13.465
I'm here for you, Tomas.

32:17.303 --> 32:19.638
Will you pray with me?

32:28.447 --> 32:30.416
(thunder rumbles)

32:30.449 --> 32:32.451
(both praying indistinctly)

32:41.160 --> 32:44.163
This pain can end...

32:44.196 --> 32:46.898
if you give us what we came for.

32:46.932 --> 32:50.569
You come all this way
for naught.

32:50.602 --> 32:52.838
-(wheezing chuckle)
-I wouldn't say that.

32:56.375 --> 32:58.677
(Maria groans)

32:58.710 --> 33:00.579
Last chance.

33:00.612 --> 33:03.615
(demonic voice):
No, it's your last chance.

33:05.951 --> 33:08.420
(normal voice):
Join me, Devin.

33:08.454 --> 33:10.256
Take me in,

33:10.289 --> 33:13.392
and I'll show you eternity.

33:13.425 --> 33:15.227
Thanks, but I'll pass.

33:15.261 --> 33:20.332
Good thing there are more
promising prospects.

33:20.366 --> 33:24.803
I hear great headway's being
made with the little cub.

33:24.836 --> 33:27.239
-(Maria chuckles)
-Little cub?

33:27.273 --> 33:30.209
MARIA:
Father Tomas, of course.

33:30.242 --> 33:33.145
Such promise.

33:33.179 --> 33:35.647
He's coming along nicely,

33:35.681 --> 33:39.585
despite the warnings
from the old, gray lion.

33:41.487 --> 33:44.056
Tomas would never be tempted.

33:44.090 --> 33:48.026
You know I'm speaking the truth,
don't you...

33:50.129 --> 33:53.165
(Marcus's voice):
...my little church mouse?

33:53.199 --> 33:55.934
Thought you could stand
with the men, did you?

33:55.967 --> 33:57.636
Come and have a look, love.

33:57.669 --> 34:02.574
I gave you an inch and you just
had to take the mile.

34:02.608 --> 34:05.544
Marcus? What is this?

34:05.577 --> 34:08.847
Oh, she never told you.

34:08.880 --> 34:10.649
Told me what?

34:10.682 --> 34:13.051
(demonic voice):
Your little friend

34:13.085 --> 34:17.223
has a few choice skeletons
in her closet.

34:17.256 --> 34:20.692
Ask her how she became
an exorcist.

34:20.726 --> 34:22.161
Quiet.

34:22.194 --> 34:25.497
The sweet postulant,

34:25.531 --> 34:28.967
so desperate to have meaning.

34:29.000 --> 34:30.569
That's enough.

34:30.602 --> 34:34.940
Ask her what happened
at the abbey 20 years ago.

34:38.744 --> 34:40.011
(Mouse gasps)

34:46.318 --> 34:48.487
Why did you lie to me?

34:48.520 --> 34:50.055
I-I didn't lie.

34:50.088 --> 34:51.423
You know Marcus.

34:51.457 --> 34:54.626
Ah...

34:54.660 --> 34:56.762
-Ah.
-Damn it.

34:58.230 --> 35:00.932
-Why did you have to go
and do that? -(shouts)

35:00.966 --> 35:02.234
(groans)

35:16.148 --> 35:19.050
You want some help?

35:19.084 --> 35:21.287
You mean the spiritual kind?

35:21.320 --> 35:23.789
Thank you very much,
I've had my fill.

35:25.791 --> 35:29.628
Look, you have every right to be
angry with me, but I was just...

35:29.661 --> 35:31.797
I was just really worried
about you.

35:33.799 --> 35:38.270
So, you, uh, invited a couple
of exorcists to the house

35:38.304 --> 35:41.673
instead of talking to me,
I got you.

35:41.707 --> 35:45.110
They believed the family
was in danger.

35:45.143 --> 35:47.913
From a demon?

35:47.946 --> 35:50.749
I know how that sounds, Andy,
but you have to admit,

35:50.782 --> 35:53.285
with everything that's
been happening here...

35:53.319 --> 35:55.787
Yeah, well, clearly,
I was possessed.

35:55.821 --> 35:58.624
I didn't know what to think.

35:58.657 --> 36:01.126
I was worried about you.

36:01.159 --> 36:03.795
The way you were acting,
it's not normal.

36:03.829 --> 36:05.597
Yeah, because one of my kids

36:05.631 --> 36:08.099
almost sent the other one
to the hospital,

36:08.133 --> 36:11.136
because I'm about to lose
my entire family.

36:20.145 --> 36:21.480
(thunder rumbles)

36:21.513 --> 36:23.649
ROSE:
I'm sorry.

36:23.682 --> 36:26.151
I should have come to you.

36:26.184 --> 36:28.153
I made a mistake.

36:31.723 --> 36:33.525
Marcus wasn't wrong.

36:41.300 --> 36:45.737
I didn't deal with my grief
after Nikki died.

36:48.407 --> 36:50.008
Rose, I didn't talk to anyone.

36:50.041 --> 36:51.443
I didn't let anyone in.

36:53.379 --> 36:54.546
I thought that if I just

36:54.580 --> 36:57.416
pushed through the pain
and I walled it off...

36:59.785 --> 37:02.588
...maybe it wouldn't hurt
so much.

37:07.393 --> 37:09.861
Andy.

37:12.864 --> 37:18.404
I'm not gonna make that same
mistake, not with you.

37:47.966 --> 37:49.868
-(gasps)
-Shh.

37:51.269 --> 37:52.771
Mom?

37:52.804 --> 37:55.140
I came back for you, baby.

37:55.173 --> 37:57.142
I came back.

38:06.752 --> 38:09.054
(both laughing)

38:16.595 --> 38:18.129
(Andy moans softly)

38:22.300 --> 38:24.603
What?

38:24.636 --> 38:26.304
What's wrong, Andy?

38:31.743 --> 38:34.846
Yeah, Andy, what's wrong?

38:37.649 --> 38:40.419
Two for the price of one.

38:40.452 --> 38:41.987
What are you waiting for?

38:52.197 --> 38:55.000
-Mom?
-I missed you so much.

38:55.033 --> 38:56.435
Did you miss me?

38:56.468 --> 38:58.169
You can't stay here.

38:58.203 --> 39:00.071
-You're gonna get in trouble.
-No, it's okay.

39:00.105 --> 39:03.274
-Put your shoes on,
as quiet as you can. -Stop it!

39:03.308 --> 39:04.810
I'm not going with you.

39:04.843 --> 39:07.846
(groans)

39:07.879 --> 39:10.782
I know you don't mean that.

39:10.816 --> 39:12.984
You're not well, baby.

39:13.018 --> 39:14.185
That's why you're saying
those things.

39:14.219 --> 39:15.587
That's why I came back for you.

39:15.621 --> 39:17.656
But we can go somewhere far away

39:17.689 --> 39:20.492
where no one can find us
and I can take care of you.

39:20.526 --> 39:22.193
-And I can make you...
-No.

39:25.897 --> 39:27.466
Harper.

39:27.499 --> 39:29.401
If you make noise
and wake people up,

39:29.435 --> 39:31.837
I don't know
what's gonna happen.

39:34.172 --> 39:36.374
You can be quiet, can't you?

39:38.677 --> 39:41.146
That's my girl.

39:41.179 --> 39:43.582
-(whimpering)
-Shh, shh, shh.

39:43.615 --> 39:45.417
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

39:57.929 --> 40:00.532
Marcus!

40:00.566 --> 40:02.200
Get your damn hands off her.

40:02.233 --> 40:04.836
-Get back. -Marcus.
-TOMAS: Let her go.

40:04.870 --> 40:07.238
-Lorraine, please.
-You all right, love?

40:07.272 --> 40:08.640
Don't you talk to her.

40:08.674 --> 40:10.742
This is your fault.
You did this.

40:10.776 --> 40:12.678
There's no way out of this.

40:12.711 --> 40:13.712
Put down the knife.

40:13.745 --> 40:14.846
Andy?

40:22.954 --> 40:24.956
Andy?

40:26.792 --> 40:28.426
Nicole.

40:35.066 --> 40:36.401
LORRAINE:
Shut up.

40:36.434 --> 40:37.969
(sobbing)

40:58.423 --> 40:59.758
(muffled screaming)

40:59.791 --> 41:01.993
-Harper!
-Harper!

41:10.702 --> 41:12.604
(gasping)

41:13.639 --> 41:14.640
(shouting)

41:14.673 --> 41:16.107
-Get off her!
-No!

41:16.141 --> 41:17.108
-Tomas!
-(Tomas yells)

41:17.142 --> 41:18.143
Come here!

41:23.281 --> 41:24.616
(Lorraine shouting)

41:24.650 --> 41:25.751
Get off!

41:25.784 --> 41:27.686
Andy!

41:29.454 --> 41:31.990
(gagging, coughing)

41:33.992 --> 41:35.293
VERITY:
Andy!

41:35.326 --> 41:37.963
(Verity screams)

41:37.996 --> 41:40.265
(coughs)

41:40.298 --> 41:43.535
-Get off me!
-(shouting)

41:43.569 --> 41:46.905
No! No!

41:48.740 --> 41:51.309
All of you, stay back!

42:04.522 --> 42:06.224
Take her!

42:06.257 --> 42:07.693
Get back!

42:15.867 --> 42:18.369
(echoes):
Andy! No!

42:19.838 --> 42:21.106
(screams)

42:23.174 --> 42:24.175
(groans)

42:26.878 --> 42:28.914

42:35.887 --> 42:37.856
Oh, my God.

42:55.707 --> 42:58.109
(roaring)

43:00.111 --> 43:02.547
(heartbeat pounding slowing)

43:17.428 --> 43:20.231
-Behold the cross of the Lord.
-And flee bands of enemies.

43:20.265 --> 43:23.234
-From the snares of the Devil.
-Deliver us, O Lord.

43:23.268 --> 43:26.371
-Behold the cross of the Lord!
-And flee bands of enemies!

43:26.404 --> 43:28.907
-From the snares of the Devil!
-Deliver us, O Lord!

43:28.940 --> 43:31.977
-Behold the cross of the Lord.
-And flee bands of enemies.

43:32.010 --> 43:33.712
-From the snares of the Devil!
-Deliver us, O Lord!

43:33.745 --> 43:34.946
Behold the cross of the Lord!

Now that you're good and scared
by The Exorcist,

44:17.355 --> 44:19.691
here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

44:23.494 --> 44:26.131
* Hey-ay-ay *

44:26.164 --> 44:29.000
* Hey-ay-ay *

44:29.034 --> 44:31.069
WOMAN:
This is our story.

44:31.102 --> 44:33.338
* Can't stop me now *

44:33.371 --> 44:35.440
* Can't stop me now *

44:35.473 --> 44:37.475
* I'm just doing what I do *

44:37.508 --> 44:38.977
* Won't stop doing what I do *
