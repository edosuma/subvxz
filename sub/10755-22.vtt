WEBVTT

00:09.781 --> 00:11.641
Go ahead, Tom.  I'm listening.

00:11.641 --> 00:12.630
Hi, Dr. Crane.

00:12.630 --> 00:14.945
Uh, it's about my girlfriend.

00:14.945 --> 00:17.584
My problem is, I don't know 
if I love her for herself

00:17.584 --> 00:20.306
Or because things are so great
between us physically.

00:20.306 --> 00:22.143
Well, how long have you two been together?

00:22.143 --> 00:25.632
Six years.

00:25.632 --> 00:30.216
And the sex is still that good?

00:30.216 --> 00:32.652
Oh man, Dr. Crane, every morning, night,

00:32.652 --> 00:34.700
three times a day on weekends.

00:34.700 --> 00:36.681
But I'm not sure we have much else in common.

00:36.681 --> 00:39.355
Well, common interests are of
course the foundation of...

00:39.355 --> 00:43.229
three times, you say?

00:43.229 --> 00:44.585
Is that abnormal?

00:44.585 --> 00:48.524
Well, uh, no, no, it's not abnormal.

00:48.524 --> 00:51.473
It's not fair, but it's not abnormal.

00:51.473 --> 00:55.352
Um, but you know, perhaps you
share more things than you

00:55.352 --> 00:56.989
think you do actually.

00:56.989 --> 00:58.465
I'll tell you what, try this:

00:58.465 --> 01:01.525
why don't you pick up a catalogue
from a local university,

01:01.525 --> 01:02.456
go through it with her and see if

01:02.456 --> 01:04.614
there are any courses you'd like to take together?

01:04.614 --> 01:07.004
That's a good idea!  Thanks, Doc.

01:07.004 --> 01:08.013
Have a great weekend.

01:08.013 --> 01:12.743
Well, I'd wish you the same but
it hardly seems necessary.

01:12.743 --> 01:13.967
Well, that's it for today, Seattle.

01:13.967 --> 01:18.756
This is Dr. Frasier Crane,
wishing you all good mental health.

01:18.756 --> 01:19.989
Niles called from the airport;

01:19.989 --> 01:20.901
he wants you to call him back.

01:20.901 --> 01:23.032
He sounded frantic!

01:23.032 --> 01:24.485
I'll call him from the car.

01:24.485 --> 01:27.000
He's flying to a conference in Switzerland;

01:27.000 --> 01:28.635
I promised to talkhim through it.

01:28.635 --> 01:30.248
Surely he's flown before?

01:30.248 --> 01:35.967
Well, not coach!

01:35.967 --> 01:39.142
Roz, is this the dress you're
wearing to the wedding?

01:39.142 --> 01:41.128
I have to, I'm a bridesmaid.

01:41.128 --> 01:43.527
Is there a reason it has to be so, so...?

01:43.527 --> 01:45.021
Hideous?

01:45.021 --> 01:47.323
It's supposed to be, so that way, the bride,

01:47.323 --> 01:51.387
By comparison, will glow!

01:51.387 --> 01:55.819
Next to this baby, she'll light
up like a bug zapper.

01:55.819 --> 01:57.546
You know, of all my friends in Wisconsin,

01:57.546 --> 02:00.623
this girl was the last one I thought
would beat me to the altar.

02:00.623 --> 02:04.288
Not the Dairy State's comeliest chunk of cheddar?

02:04.288 --> 02:06.369
Let's just say she works in her
father's ice cream parlour

02:06.369 --> 02:09.413
and she eats her mistakes.

02:09.413 --> 02:10.905
The groom's family makes cones.

02:10.905 --> 02:15.039
Oh, well, we don't need Freud for that, do we?

02:15.039 --> 02:18.170
The whole thing is just so depressing.

02:18.170 --> 02:21.236
Lately everyone I know is settling down,

02:21.236 --> 02:24.215
getting married, having children.

02:24.215 --> 02:26.261
What am I doing wrong?

02:26.261 --> 02:28.824
Well, do you want me to answer
as a friend, or a therapist?

02:28.824 --> 02:30.238
As a friend!

02:30.238 --> 02:31.617
See a therapist.

02:31.617 --> 02:33.478
Frasier!

02:33.478 --> 02:35.990
Well, Roz, I think your whole problem stems from

02:35.990 --> 02:39.759
some unresolved issues that cause you
to choose the men you date.

02:39.759 --> 02:42.759
Always flashy and superficial,
offering no prospect

02:42.759 --> 02:45.420
of a lasting relationship.

02:45.420 --> 02:46.912
Why would I do that?

02:46.912 --> 02:50.208
Maybe fear of commitment, fear of being hurt.

02:50.208 --> 02:53.805
But maybe it's time you started
looking at different kinds of men.

02:53.805 --> 02:57.314
You know, men who are more settled,
a little less flash

02:57.314 --> 02:59.506
and more substance.

02:59.506 --> 03:01.425
You're probably right, Frasier.

03:01.425 --> 03:02.239
Hey, if I were smart,

03:02.239 --> 03:09.212
I'd go out with the next guy I see
I'm not the least bit attracted to.

03:09.212 --> 03:10.580
Roth, Roth, I juth bit my tongue.

03:10.580 --> 03:13.091
Can you kith it and make it better?

03:13.091 --> 03:15.960
The next one after him.

03:15.960 --> 03:17.179
Oh, Doc, Doc.

03:17.179 --> 03:18.418
Here's my video camera.

03:18.418 --> 03:19.886
Oh, thank you, Bulldog.

03:19.886 --> 03:20.983
What do you need it for?

03:20.983 --> 03:22.297
Well, I'm going to record my father.

03:22.297 --> 03:25.660
I'm going to have hislife on tape
so Frederick can enjoy it in years to come.

03:25.660 --> 03:26.792
What a good idea!

03:26.792 --> 03:30.029
Whoa!  That's the ugliest thing I ever saw!

03:30.029 --> 03:31.261
I'm going to a wedding.

03:31.261 --> 03:32.317
Oh, I love weddings.

03:32.317 --> 03:35.519
Never been to a wedding where
I didn'tbag at least one bridesmaid.

03:35.519 --> 03:39.188
And the uglier the dress, thequicker
they want to get out of them.

03:39.188 --> 03:43.780
This one would hit the floor before the rice!

03:43.780 --> 03:45.433
I've got to get going.

03:45.433 --> 03:48.103
Can you believe I actually have to
be seen in public in this thing?

03:48.103 --> 03:49.446
Well, Roz, it's only for a few hours.

03:49.446 --> 03:53.212
After that you can donate it
to the Salvation Army...

03:53.212 --> 03:55.678
and one day make some Irish drag queen very happy.

04:01.514 --> 04:03.091
What's the point of going to
Switzerland without spending a

04:03.091 --> 04:03.987
day on the slopes?

04:03.987 --> 04:05.848
So I ducked out of the conference and who

04:05.848 --> 04:09.033
should I run into, but Maris?

04:09.033 --> 04:13.701
She'd just flown in for heryearly
goat placenta treatments!

04:13.701 --> 04:17.998
Good Lord, is it placenta
treatment time again already?

04:17.998 --> 04:19.527
We had a set-to on the slopes.

04:19.527 --> 04:21.802
She ran, I tried to followher tracks in the snow,

04:21.802 --> 04:27.010
but alas, she made none.

04:27.010 --> 04:28.659
Oh, dear...

04:28.659 --> 04:29.648
What is it?  What's the matter?

04:29.648 --> 04:31.626
I just spotted someone.

04:31.626 --> 04:33.413
It's my least favorite patient.

04:33.413 --> 04:35.513
The man's a compulsive womaniser.

04:35.513 --> 04:38.732
He goes through so many women,
he calls them all by the same odious nickname,

04:38.732 --> 04:40.663
"Sunshine," to avoid slip-ups.

04:40.663 --> 04:42.184
Oh, God.

04:42.184 --> 04:45.003
Frasier, what do you do when
you don't like a patient?

04:45.003 --> 04:47.795
Well, it's a tricky subject, isn't it?

04:47.795 --> 04:48.979
How long have you been seeing him?

04:48.979 --> 04:49.664
Six months.

04:49.664 --> 04:51.192
We've made no progress whatsover.

04:51.192 --> 04:55.255
Sometimes Ifeel he comes in not
so much for help as to brag.

04:55.255 --> 04:57.804
He claimsto have been with, at last count,

04:57.804 --> 04:59.895
one hundred and fifty women!

04:59.895 --> 05:01.109
Oh puh-leease!

05:01.109 --> 05:03.006
A hundred and fifty!

05:03.006 --> 05:08.665
As if anything over, say... seven weren't absurd.

05:08.665 --> 05:16.677
Well, I would say eleven, but I get your point.

05:16.677 --> 05:21.424
Oh, now serving one hundred and fifty-one.

05:21.424 --> 05:23.757
Good God!  He's here to see Roz?

05:23.757 --> 05:26.318
Yes, well, no doubt they met
when Sealy Posturepedic named

05:26.318 --> 05:29.284
them Man and Woman of the Year.

05:29.284 --> 05:30.584
Niles, you don't understand.

05:30.584 --> 05:33.227
She-she'sbeen very vulnerable lately.

05:33.227 --> 05:34.762
Well, I hope you'll forgive me
if I don't stick around.

05:34.762 --> 05:36.677
I'd like to leave before she makesintroductions.

05:36.677 --> 05:38.548
I've got to warn her!

05:38.548 --> 05:40.467
Warn her how?

05:40.467 --> 05:41.975
What I just told you was in strict confidence,

05:41.975 --> 05:42.936
therapist to therapist.

05:42.936 --> 05:43.723
You can't go repeating it!

05:43.723 --> 05:44.352
But-but-

05:44.352 --> 05:45.387
No!

05:45.387 --> 05:47.401
Oh... of course, of course,
you're right, I won't.

05:47.401 --> 05:51.816
But that is the last man that Roz should be with!

05:51.816 --> 05:52.318
Well, don't worry.

05:52.318 --> 05:56.281
Knowing Roz, he won't be.

05:56.281 --> 05:57.708
Hey, Frasier!

05:57.708 --> 05:58.655
Oh, Roz!

05:58.655 --> 06:00.473
I'd like to introduce you to someone.

06:00.473 --> 06:02.332
This is Ben Collins.

06:02.332 --> 06:03.962
Frasier Crane, pleasure.

06:03.962 --> 06:05.061
Likewise.

06:05.061 --> 06:06.132
Is it all right if we join you?

06:06.132 --> 06:07.577
Oh, why not??

06:07.577 --> 06:11.605
I'll grab our coffees.

06:11.605 --> 06:14.100
He is the greatest guy!

06:14.100 --> 06:16.899
You know, when I first met him,
I thought, "He's not my type."

06:16.899 --> 06:18.806
Then I remembered what you said.

06:18.806 --> 06:20.871
And I'm so glad you gave me that advice, Frasier,

06:20.871 --> 06:23.405
because without it, I would never
have given him a second look.

06:23.405 --> 06:27.682
Well, Roz, let's not rule out
that all-important third look.

06:27.682 --> 06:29.700
Would you stop worrying about me, Frasier?

06:29.700 --> 06:30.951
This one'sdifferent.

06:30.951 --> 06:32.929
I can tell he really cares about me.

06:32.929 --> 06:35.075
Here you go, Sunshine!

06:37.000 --> 06:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:45.953 --> 06:47.522
Why can't you be like other dogs?

06:47.522 --> 06:55.377
Why can't you bring home bones
or animals you kill?

06:55.377 --> 06:57.428
Give me those!

06:57.428 --> 07:02.421
Relax, I'm just going to put them
with the roses you picked yesterday.

07:02.421 --> 07:05.293
Oh hey, Dad!  Fresh from your walk?

07:05.293 --> 07:08.492
I think now is as good a time as
any to crank up the ol' camcorder.

07:08.492 --> 07:09.709
Nah, maybe later.

07:09.709 --> 07:12.219
Oh Dad, you've been saying "no" for weeks now!

07:12.219 --> 07:15.673
Well, gee, some people would take that for a hint!

07:15.673 --> 07:18.141
All you have to do is just sit
here and talk about yourlife.

07:18.141 --> 07:19.593
Life's got nothing to do with it!

07:19.593 --> 07:20.911
This is about me dying and you having

07:20.911 --> 07:23.908
something to look at after I'm dead.

07:23.908 --> 07:25.664
The wholething gives me the creeps!

07:25.664 --> 07:29.109
I can't believe you're refusing to record your history,

07:29.109 --> 07:31.664
thestory that only you, Martin Crane, can tell,

07:31.664 --> 07:33.804
because it gives you the creeps!

07:33.804 --> 07:36.263
OK then, I'll tell you the real truth.

07:36.263 --> 07:40.367
My Indian heritage forbids it.

07:40.367 --> 07:46.183
I'm afraid your magic box will rob me of my spirit.

07:46.183 --> 07:47.616
I don't know why you're being so negative about this.

07:47.616 --> 07:48.921
It'snot really for when you're dead.

07:48.921 --> 07:52.436
It's for when you've lostyour mind.

07:52.436 --> 07:53.039
Hey, Frasier.

07:53.039 --> 07:54.303
Oh hello, Roz!

07:54.303 --> 07:55.868
Why, after waiting for forty-five minutes,

07:55.868 --> 07:58.251
did I assume you'd forgotten our appointment?

07:58.251 --> 08:02.021
Sorry, but uh... I was on my way out, when Ben called.

08:02.021 --> 08:03.410
Oh yes... Ben.

08:03.410 --> 08:04.840
Oh, what's with you?

08:04.840 --> 08:07.319
Every time I bring him up, you make thatface.

08:07.319 --> 08:10.076
I'm getting the sense that you
don't like him that much.

08:10.076 --> 08:11.595
It's just that I know something about Ben...

08:11.595 --> 08:14.067
What?

08:14.067 --> 08:16.184
He's a little old for you.

08:16.184 --> 08:17.650
He's thirty-six!

08:17.650 --> 08:18.392
Exactly my point!

08:18.392 --> 08:19.576
When you were a freshman, he was a senior.

08:19.576 --> 08:21.185
That never works out!

08:21.185 --> 08:22.448
I'm getting my briefcase!

08:22.448 --> 08:24.846
I'll go get a Coke.

08:24.846 --> 08:26.000
Oh, hi, Daphne!

08:26.000 --> 08:27.646
Hello, Roz.  How are you?

08:27.646 --> 08:30.829
OK... can I ask you something?

08:30.829 --> 08:32.787
Does Frasier seem weird to you-?

08:32.787 --> 08:35.908
Oh God, yes.

08:35.908 --> 08:37.443
I haven't finished my question yet.

08:37.443 --> 08:38.842
Yes, well, when you know the answer,

08:38.842 --> 08:42.273
it's hard not to hit thebuzzer.

08:42.273 --> 08:43.931
Well, this is strange.

08:43.931 --> 08:45.925
I mean, for the first time in years,

08:45.925 --> 08:47.632
I'm in a really solid relationship,

08:47.632 --> 08:51.329
and instead of being happy for me,
Frasier seems upset.

08:51.329 --> 08:56.185
Oh, that is odd.  Unless...

08:56.185 --> 08:57.550
Unless what?

08:57.550 --> 08:58.953
Well...

08:58.953 --> 09:02.526
Dr. Crane is jealous of Benbecause
he wants you for himself.

09:02.526 --> 09:04.405
Huh?

09:04.405 --> 09:07.305
Ohhh, no, no, no!

09:07.305 --> 09:08.954
Yes, what else could it be?

09:08.954 --> 09:10.193
Fra-Frasier?

09:10.193 --> 09:11.486
What, you really think so?

09:11.486 --> 09:15.186
Daphne, no!  No way!  No, he doesn't -

09:15.186 --> 09:18.514
Frasier is the one who told me to
find myself a new boyfriend.

09:18.514 --> 09:20.837
Someone who is settled, someone more nurturing, someone

09:20.837 --> 09:22.594
with substance over flash.

09:22.594 --> 09:26.282
They could put that on Dr. Crane's tombstone.

09:26.282 --> 09:27.647
Oh, come on!  No way!

09:27.647 --> 09:29.357
Yes!  Wait, there's something else.

09:29.357 --> 09:30.596
What?

09:30.596 --> 09:31.912
I probably shouldn't tell you this.

09:31.912 --> 09:34.785
But earlier this morning, Dr. Crane was on the phone

09:34.785 --> 09:36.224
with his brother and he said that

09:36.224 --> 09:39.146
your relationship with Ben was driving him crazy,

09:39.146 --> 09:41.554
and that he was dying to tell you but he can't.

09:41.554 --> 09:44.615
Oh my God, did you hear him say that?!

09:44.615 --> 09:45.892
I certainly did!

09:45.892 --> 09:48.091
Oh, this is too weird, this is too weird!

09:48.091 --> 09:49.059
What am I going to say?

09:49.059 --> 09:50.195
Maybe I won't say anything.

09:50.195 --> 09:51.800
Maybe he'll just see how happy I am with Ben.

09:51.800 --> 09:53.302
Oh, Ben, Ben, Ben!

09:53.302 --> 09:55.232
My God, Roz, would you just drop it with

09:55.232 --> 09:59.816
Ben for a minute and pay some attention to me?

09:59.816 --> 10:01.241
Oh-kaay!

10:09.223 --> 10:10.194
Morning, Roz!

10:10.194 --> 10:11.066
Hi, Frasier!

10:11.066 --> 10:13.843
Hey, you look lovely, that
colour's very flattering!

10:13.843 --> 10:14.557
Thanks.

10:14.557 --> 10:16.620
You know, I think this calls for a hug!

10:16.620 --> 10:17.637
Oh, I don't look that good.

10:17.637 --> 10:20.183
No, no, no, no, Roz.

10:20.183 --> 10:20.969
Look!

10:20.969 --> 10:22.860
My God, the ratings are in,
and we did better in our timeslot

10:22.860 --> 10:24.324
this week than ever before!

10:24.324 --> 10:28.891
Congratulations, partner!

10:28.891 --> 10:31.890
Why don't we have dinner tonight, celebrate?

10:31.890 --> 10:36.326
That sounds so fun... but I kinda have plans.

10:36.326 --> 10:37.566
I should have known.

10:37.566 --> 10:39.015
Another time, perhaps.

10:39.015 --> 10:41.665
Yeah sure, that sounds great.

10:41.665 --> 10:42.538
Yo, Doc.

10:42.538 --> 10:43.987
When are you going to return my video camera?

10:43.987 --> 10:46.301
I got a hot date tonight and
I want to record certain events

10:46.301 --> 10:48.818
for posterity, if you know what I mean.

10:48.818 --> 10:50.377
Uh... tomorrow, Bulldog.

10:50.377 --> 10:53.279
Well, maybe tonight you could
just have a police sketch artist

10:53.279 --> 10:57.995
crouch on your balcony.

10:57.995 --> 10:59.997
So Mom, let me ask you something.

10:59.997 --> 11:03.354
How long did you know Dad before
you told him youloved him?

11:03.354 --> 11:07.001
Mom?  Mom?  Mom, you've been
divorced fifteen years!

11:07.001 --> 11:09.922
Let it go!

11:09.922 --> 11:13.132
Listen, Ben is coming over to
dinner tonight, and I think

11:13.132 --> 11:15.977
I'm going to tell him I love him.

11:15.977 --> 11:17.306
I gotta work, bye!

11:17.306 --> 11:18.620
Oh I'm, I'm sorry, Roz.

11:18.620 --> 11:20.008
I should have knocked.

11:20.008 --> 11:21.421
It's OK, it's OK, it's OK!

11:21.421 --> 11:27.253
I couldn't help overhearing the
last part of your conversation there.

11:27.253 --> 11:30.413
You think you're not rushing
things a little bit with Ben?

11:30.413 --> 11:32.815
Are you really that serious?

11:32.815 --> 11:34.199
Yes, I am.

11:34.199 --> 11:37.491
But you know, there are a lot of men in the world.

11:37.491 --> 11:41.643
And lots of women, too!

11:41.643 --> 11:45.916
Well, that's more of a personal preference but I...

11:45.916 --> 11:47.824
I meant for you!

11:47.824 --> 11:50.841
Look, Frasier, what I'm trying to say is

11:50.841 --> 11:53.265
I know you have a problem with me and Ben,

11:53.265 --> 11:56.356
but we're happy together.

11:56.356 --> 11:58.997
Well, it's just that you've only
been going out for a month!

11:58.997 --> 12:01.601
Well, sometimes, that's all it takes.

12:01.601 --> 12:03.751
Fifteen seconds!

12:03.751 --> 12:06.907
Listen Frasier, I'd like to think that

12:06.907 --> 12:09.719
there's some small part of you that is happy for me.

12:09.719 --> 12:13.664
Afterall, it WAS your advice that got me this far!

12:13.664 --> 12:15.419
Of course I'm happy for you.

12:15.419 --> 12:19.216
Thanks.

12:19.216 --> 12:23.367
Me and my stupid advice...

12:23.367 --> 12:27.218
will be with you for the next
three hours, Seattle!

12:30.439 --> 12:31.836
I'm not doing it, it's morbid.

12:31.836 --> 12:33.030
It's not morbid.

12:33.030 --> 12:34.207
And besides, if you don't do it,

12:34.207 --> 12:36.528
the only footage we'll have of
you in the family archives is you

12:36.528 --> 12:41.108
pretending your stomach was a face
that summer at the lake.

12:41.108 --> 12:43.429
Alright Niles, if it'll shut you up, I'll do it.

12:43.429 --> 12:44.570
Thanks, Dad!

12:44.570 --> 12:48.085
We'll make this quick and easy.

12:48.085 --> 12:48.906
Is that what you're wearing?

12:48.906 --> 12:49.469
Forget it.

12:49.469 --> 12:50.906
No, no no, all right.

12:50.906 --> 12:54.491
Here we go, here we go.

12:54.491 --> 12:55.241
OK...

12:55.241 --> 12:56.874
My name's Martin Crane.

12:56.874 --> 13:00.886
When I made this tape, I was sixty-four years old.

13:00.886 --> 13:08.587
But now... I'm DEAD!

13:08.587 --> 13:12.529
Trapped in a box, underground...

13:12.529 --> 13:17.391
Pretty scary, huh?

13:17.391 --> 13:20.035
Dad, surely you must have some
message you want to leave for

13:20.035 --> 13:21.616
the Cranes of the twenty-first century?

13:21.616 --> 13:26.122
Alright, alright, I do.

13:26.122 --> 13:28.355
Remember to always work hard,

13:28.355 --> 13:31.428
and that family comes first.

13:31.428 --> 13:36.484
And... I have a million bucks in unmarked bills

13:36.484 --> 13:37.924
that I took off a drug dealer that

13:37.924 --> 13:42.687
I have stashed in my old army foot locker.

13:42.687 --> 13:48.041
The combination is left fifteen, right thirty-two,

13:48.041 --> 14:02.726
le-le...

14:02.726 --> 14:07.465
Future generations: see what I had to put up with?

14:07.465 --> 14:08.084
Hello.

14:08.084 --> 14:08.639
Hello.

14:08.639 --> 14:09.139
Hello.

14:09.139 --> 14:10.445
I suppose this means we're finished?

14:10.445 --> 14:14.861
Well, unless you want future
generations to see me go to the can!

14:14.861 --> 14:16.177
Niles, actually I'm glad you're here.

14:16.177 --> 14:17.490
I have to talk to youabout Roz.

14:17.490 --> 14:18.582
Oh, no, no, no.

14:18.582 --> 14:19.774
I've breached my ethics once already.

14:19.774 --> 14:21.358
Niles, please, I've gotten desperate!

14:21.358 --> 14:22.291
No, no, no!

14:22.291 --> 14:25.409
Niles, she plans to tell him that
she loves him tonight!

14:25.409 --> 14:28.229
From what you told me about Ben's patterns,

14:28.229 --> 14:30.523
that will be the end of it
and Roz will be shattered.

14:30.523 --> 14:34.401
God, there has got to be some loophole
in this confidentiality rule that

14:34.401 --> 14:37.842
will allow me to warn her
and still preserve your ethics.

14:37.842 --> 14:41.335
Niles!  Help me look through these textbooks!

14:41.335 --> 14:42.318
No, I'll have no part in this!

14:42.318 --> 14:43.841
Please, Niles!  Think of Roz!

14:43.841 --> 14:45.068
I'm thinking of my license!

14:45.068 --> 14:46.935
Well then, think of what Freud said!

14:46.935 --> 14:54.151
"We are never so helplessly
unhappy as when we lose love."

14:54.151 --> 14:56.199
Oh, all right!

14:56.199 --> 14:58.333
But that was dirty pool, using a Freud quotation.

14:58.333 --> 15:00.739
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

15:00.739 --> 15:02.015
It's the Crane boys' kryptonite.

15:02.015 --> 15:04.052
I know, I know.  Thank you.

15:04.052 --> 15:08.903
Say, here's a possibility.

15:08.903 --> 15:11.641
According to this, it says we can warn her

15:11.641 --> 15:14.202
if he means to do her bodily harm.

15:14.202 --> 15:14.919
Does he?

15:14.919 --> 15:15.605
No.

15:15.605 --> 15:18.490
Damn!

15:18.490 --> 15:26.300
It would be so much easier
if Roz were mentally incompetent.

15:26.300 --> 15:27.786
Go on...

15:27.786 --> 15:32.067
Well, then there'd be some
justification for protecting her.

15:32.067 --> 15:33.575
Is she irrational?

15:33.575 --> 15:36.475
She did attack a vending machine once,

15:36.475 --> 15:39.479
when a Twinkie came out of the Oreo chute.

15:39.479 --> 15:41.190
Borderline, borderline.

15:41.190 --> 15:42.565
Does she ever act delusional?

15:42.565 --> 15:43.445
Well, she often claims that

15:43.445 --> 15:45.237
she is responsible for thesuccess of our show.

15:45.237 --> 15:47.555
Building, building.

15:47.555 --> 15:49.802
Does she display below-average intelligence?

15:49.802 --> 15:52.807
She once ordered a bottle of white Zinfandel!

15:52.807 --> 15:54.858
Jackpot!

15:54.858 --> 15:56.344
Go to her, she's a threat to herself!

15:56.344 --> 15:58.963
It's amazing they even let the woman drive!

16:01.875 --> 16:02.627
Who is it?

16:02.627 --> 16:07.839
It's Frasier!

16:07.839 --> 16:09.508
Oh my God!  What happened?

16:09.508 --> 16:11.274
He dumped me, Frasier!

16:11.274 --> 16:18.665
Oh, oh, honey!  I - come here.  Oh God...

16:18.665 --> 16:20.612
Everything was going great!

16:20.612 --> 16:23.043
Until I said "I love you, Ben."

16:23.043 --> 16:24.383
Then he got this look on his face,

16:24.383 --> 16:31.027
like he'd taken a wrong turn
in a really bad neighbourhood!

16:31.027 --> 16:34.526
He didn't even touch the champagne.

16:34.526 --> 16:39.272
Oh I'm... I'm sorry, Roz.  Here.

16:39.272 --> 16:41.703
Thank you.

16:41.703 --> 16:47.272
When you...

16:47.272 --> 16:49.615
when you professed your love for him,

16:49.615 --> 16:54.092
uh... were you dressed like that?

16:54.092 --> 16:58.187
No!  After he left, I went in to change,

16:58.187 --> 17:03.291
and I saw all theseold bridesmaid
dresses hanging in the closet.

17:03.291 --> 17:05.170
And that's when it hit me.

17:05.170 --> 17:08.421
That's what I am, a bridesmaid!

17:08.421 --> 17:10.565
I might as well wear the uniform!

17:10.565 --> 17:14.923
Oh Roz, no, no!  Now, now, come on!

17:14.923 --> 17:17.181
Yes!

17:17.181 --> 17:18.470
Come on!  Now look, look, you know,

17:18.470 --> 17:20.137
I find that whenever I'm low,

17:20.137 --> 17:24.248
it always lifts my spirits when
I just spruce up a bit.

17:24.248 --> 17:29.166
It wouldn't hurt to run a brush through your hair...

17:29.166 --> 17:30.128
or through your teeth.

17:30.128 --> 17:33.464
Oh God!

17:33.464 --> 17:34.946
I must look awful!

17:34.946 --> 17:37.843
No, no, not at all.

17:37.843 --> 17:41.978
You're a big fat liar.

17:41.978 --> 17:48.910
But you were right about Ben,
and I just didn't see it.

17:48.910 --> 17:51.328
What made you come over here anyway?

17:51.328 --> 17:55.130
Well, actually, I was coming
over here to take one last stab

17:55.130 --> 17:58.699
at convincing you that Ben was the wrong man for you.

17:58.699 --> 18:00.759
You deserve someone better, Roz.

18:00.759 --> 18:02.011
Oh, yeah,

18:02.011 --> 18:10.270
I'm a real catch!

18:10.270 --> 18:16.222
Hell...

18:16.222 --> 18:19.126
Oh, now, things really aren't all as dark as they seem.

18:19.126 --> 18:25.852
You know, you're a-a beautiful, intelligent, desirable...

18:25.852 --> 18:29.264
Why don't you let me just take a stab at that, will you?

18:29.264 --> 18:31.631
I can't imagine any man not
thinking himself the luckiest

18:31.631 --> 18:34.402
in the world to be with you.

18:34.402 --> 18:37.028
You really do... think that, don't you?

18:37.028 --> 18:39.569
Yes, and I'm surprised you even had to ask me that.

18:39.569 --> 18:41.579
I guess I didn't.

18:41.579 --> 18:50.620
I've known that you've had these
romanticfeelings toward me, for a while.

18:50.620 --> 18:51.908
What?

18:51.908 --> 18:54.670
Oh come on!  Don't deny it.

18:54.670 --> 18:58.803
Those hints about finding someone
with substance over style,

18:58.803 --> 19:00.731
the way you hated Ben.

19:00.731 --> 19:03.611
And then Daphne told me she overheard you telling Niles that

19:03.611 --> 19:05.744
you couldn't stop thinking about me and

19:05.744 --> 19:07.152
wanted to tell me the truth!

19:07.152 --> 19:07.976
Daphne told you that?

19:07.976 --> 19:09.045
Yeah - don't be mad at her.

19:09.045 --> 19:10.321
No, no, I'm not.

19:10.321 --> 19:11.645
It's just that when she said that...

19:11.645 --> 19:12.564
No it's OK, Frasier.

19:12.564 --> 19:15.345
I'm glad she told me.

19:15.345 --> 19:18.782
The only thingkeeping me from
completely falling apart right now is

19:18.782 --> 19:27.721
knowing that someone like you could be interested in me.

19:27.721 --> 19:41.701
Well, then... there's no point in denying it, is there?

19:41.701 --> 19:46.559
You know, maybe the idea of you and me isn't so crazy.

19:46.559 --> 19:49.554
You are the kind of man I should be with!

19:49.554 --> 19:52.743
Smart, gentle...

19:52.743 --> 19:54.334
Ow!  I said gentle!

19:54.334 --> 19:56.899
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Roz.

19:56.899 --> 19:58.920
Uh, you know, it's just that there are so many...

19:58.920 --> 20:02.184
I know, I know.  Workplace romances always fail.

20:02.184 --> 20:03.555
Exactly my point!

20:03.555 --> 20:05.028
And I'm on the rebound.

20:05.028 --> 20:06.832
I've got to give myself time toheal.

20:06.832 --> 20:11.274
Yes yes, lots of time.

20:11.274 --> 20:13.994
On the other hand, you are the
one who always says the best

20:13.994 --> 20:16.129
relationships start with friendship.

20:16.129 --> 20:18.287
Well, I do say that, yes.

20:18.287 --> 20:19.295
It's true, but...

20:19.295 --> 20:22.336
And we're friends, aren't we?

20:22.336 --> 20:24.177
We're very good friends.

20:24.177 --> 20:26.223
Right now we are both free.

20:26.223 --> 20:30.788
Oh well, in my case, painfully free.

20:30.788 --> 20:41.270
You know, maybe if we both went
into it with our eyes open...?

20:41.270 --> 20:44.475
Oh no, what am I saying?

20:44.475 --> 20:47.493
My relationship with you is
probably the healthiest one

20:47.493 --> 20:49.414
I've ever had with a man!

20:49.414 --> 20:50.754
I don't want to screw that up.

20:50.754 --> 20:52.546
Now that you mention it,

20:52.546 --> 20:56.411
my relationship with you isprobably
the best one I've ever had with a woman!

20:56.411 --> 21:04.280
Not that it's been much of a horse race, but...

21:04.280 --> 21:09.110
To friendship?

21:09.110 --> 21:19.375
Here's hoping the next time you
tell a man you love him, he says it back.

21:19.375 --> 21:21.498
Well, let's see.

21:21.498 --> 21:24.689
I love you, Frasier.
