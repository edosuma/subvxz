00:02.520 --> 00:04.320
KAT NARRATING: Previously
on "Dance Academy."

00:04.360 --> 00:06.480
-Look, let's just forget
the whole mentor thing.

00:06.519 --> 00:10.439
Let's just call it
mates, yeah?

00:10.480 --> 00:13.199
Where's my wallet?

00:13.240 --> 00:14.599
-There's some cash missing.

00:14.640 --> 00:15.359
I can give it back--

00:15.400 --> 00:18.480
-I don't want your money.

00:18.519 --> 00:20.199
But you owe me.

00:20.239 --> 00:21.239
-And leaving me at the beach.

00:21.280 --> 00:22.079
Hilarious, right?

00:22.120 --> 00:23.239
-But you weren't even with us.

00:23.280 --> 00:25.039
-Not responding to my
pros and cons list.

00:25.079 --> 00:27.079
Because of you, the whole school
is laughing at me.

00:27.120 --> 00:29.039
-What are you talking
about here?

00:29.079 --> 00:31.399
I don't even know you.

00:31.440 --> 00:32.600
-Because he's distracting.

00:32.640 --> 00:34.159
And he's frustrating and
generally bad for me.

00:34.200 --> 00:36.119
From now on, I'm sticking
with my friends.

00:45.240 --> 00:48.200
THEME SONG: Whoa, oh, oh.

00:48.240 --> 00:51.200
Whoa, oh, oh.

00:51.240 --> 00:54.600
Take a breath, close
your eyes.

00:58.640 --> 01:01.159
Take a leap of faith and
lead the way tonight.

01:06.200 --> 01:07.560
This is my chance.

01:07.599 --> 01:09.560
This is my chance.

01:09.599 --> 01:14.159
My chance to feel alive.

01:14.200 --> 01:16.519
Whoa, oh, oh.

01:16.560 --> 01:18.519
Whoa, oh, oh.

01:37.519 --> 01:38.799
-Hip up.

01:38.840 --> 01:40.359
It's not about steps and it's
not about technique.

01:40.400 --> 01:42.079
TARA NARRATING: In ballet,
you always know where

01:42.120 --> 01:43.719
the next step is.

01:43.760 --> 01:47.359
The rules haven't changed for
the last hundred years.

01:47.400 --> 01:50.159
-Yeah, I don't want you
to look perfect.

01:50.200 --> 01:53.480
I want you to be real.

01:53.519 --> 01:57.079
Abigail, your upper body
looks like a stick.

01:57.120 --> 01:58.480
There's no grooving.

01:58.519 --> 02:00.159
-That's because I'm
a ballet dancer.

02:00.200 --> 02:03.719
-Do not tell me your problem.

02:03.760 --> 02:06.159
TARA NARRATING: But things can't
stay the same forever.

02:06.200 --> 02:09.479
We all have to learn
new tricks.

02:09.520 --> 02:11.479
Even when every fiber
of our being is

02:11.520 --> 02:14.199
screaming out against it.

02:14.240 --> 02:14.639
-Christian.

02:14.680 --> 02:15.800
Let's go.

02:22.080 --> 02:23.840
See the way he's owning it?

02:27.840 --> 02:29.159
You try.

02:32.719 --> 02:35.199
Looser.

02:35.240 --> 02:36.639
I said looser.

02:36.680 --> 02:39.639
ABIGAIL (OFFSCREEN): If I was
any looser, I'd fall over.

02:39.680 --> 02:40.360
-Good.

02:40.400 --> 02:41.599
Good, good, good.

02:54.719 --> 02:56.039
-Ooh.

02:58.199 --> 03:00.639
For a middle class Jewish boy
from [inaudible], I think I'm

03:00.680 --> 03:02.039
getting the hang of
this hip-hop, Kat.

03:02.080 --> 03:04.800
Sup player?

03:04.840 --> 03:06.000
Katsimi.

03:06.039 --> 03:07.680
-You know, it's kind of
wrong even hearing you

03:07.719 --> 03:09.759
say the words hip-hop.

03:09.800 --> 03:10.319
-Hip.

03:10.360 --> 03:11.240
-No don't.

03:11.280 --> 03:12.479
-Hop?

03:14.520 --> 03:16.479
-Ethan, I made you a mix CD.

03:16.520 --> 03:17.439
It's just a few dance tracks.

03:17.479 --> 03:18.800
Um, some contemporary.

03:18.840 --> 03:20.319
-She isn't.

03:20.360 --> 03:21.639
-No, she is.

03:21.680 --> 03:22.599
-Uh, sure.

03:22.639 --> 03:23.280
Thanks.

03:23.319 --> 03:24.360
I'll give it a listen.

03:24.400 --> 03:25.400
-OK, great.

03:25.439 --> 03:26.599
That would be great.

03:30.840 --> 03:33.080
-Did you just give my
brother a mix CD?

03:33.120 --> 03:36.360
-It's just a few dance tracks.

03:36.400 --> 03:39.400
I'm only being friendly.

03:39.439 --> 03:40.439
I tried.

03:40.479 --> 03:41.520
I really tried not to
think about him.

03:41.560 --> 03:43.199
I can't help it.

03:43.240 --> 03:43.800
-Yeah.

03:43.840 --> 03:44.479
She did try, Kat.

03:44.520 --> 03:46.400
-Not hard enough.

03:46.439 --> 03:47.400
-Hey, Christian.

03:47.439 --> 03:48.599
Stop.

03:50.840 --> 03:52.400
Wait up.

03:52.439 --> 03:54.360
I'm doing this piece for
the showcase tomorrow.

03:54.400 --> 03:56.159
One of my dancers got injured.

03:56.199 --> 03:57.719
It's a bit of hip-hop.

03:57.759 --> 03:58.840
You up for it?

03:58.879 --> 04:00.120
-Uh, yeah.

04:00.159 --> 04:01.400
I just do class work.

04:01.439 --> 04:03.199
I don't do extra.

04:03.240 --> 04:05.599
-Well, any of the other first
years would kill for this?

04:05.639 --> 04:06.599
-Really?

04:06.639 --> 04:09.680
You should probably
ask one of them.

04:09.719 --> 04:13.479
-Hey, I didn't say
you could leave.

04:13.520 --> 04:15.800
I could have told Kennedy
about the wallet.

04:15.840 --> 04:17.199
You owe me.

04:23.160 --> 04:26.720
Look, I should have said, if you
do this, you get to blow

04:26.759 --> 04:28.680
off class for the
rest of the day.

04:36.680 --> 04:38.439
-To be fair, you can't
control a crush.

04:38.480 --> 04:39.199
-Thank you.

04:39.240 --> 04:40.199
That's all I'm saying.

04:40.240 --> 04:42.759
-But it's not actually real.

04:42.800 --> 04:45.319
-But it is to me.

04:45.360 --> 04:46.319
-OK.

04:46.360 --> 04:48.600
Do you have to be so
open about it?

04:48.639 --> 04:51.160
-Well, if I didn't do anything,

04:51.199 --> 04:53.480
nothing would ever happen.

04:53.519 --> 04:54.519
-Yeah.

04:54.560 --> 04:57.480
You can make as many mix
CDs as you like.

04:57.519 --> 05:01.240
The fact is, if a boy likes you,
he is going to make the

05:01.279 --> 05:02.160
first move.

05:02.199 --> 05:03.839
-That is so last century.

05:03.879 --> 05:06.199
-And yet real.

05:06.240 --> 05:08.360
-It's true, T.

05:08.399 --> 05:10.319
-Like you'd know, they'd
Lieberman.

05:10.360 --> 05:11.319
-Hey, I'm a guy.

05:11.360 --> 05:12.240
I've got moves.

05:12.279 --> 05:14.839
-I'm surprised at you, Kat.

05:14.879 --> 05:18.319
Did feminists fight and--

05:18.360 --> 05:19.680
and die--

05:19.720 --> 05:24.199
and burn underwear just so we
could wait by the phone?

05:28.199 --> 05:29.319
-OK.

05:29.360 --> 05:31.600
So we're in the middle
of a turf war, yeah?

05:31.639 --> 05:33.480
And one of the gang leaders--

05:33.519 --> 05:35.800
that's you-- has a thing for
a chick in the other gang.

05:35.839 --> 05:37.199
That's Belle.

05:51.399 --> 05:54.160
She's dancing in a club
when he sees her.

05:54.199 --> 05:55.680
He loves her moves, yeah.

05:59.240 --> 05:59.879
Nice, Belle.

05:59.920 --> 06:02.040
So they dance together.

06:02.079 --> 06:05.680
In the club, they're hot.

06:05.720 --> 06:10.079
But they can't be together
because of the turf war.

06:10.120 --> 06:12.399
This night is all they have.

06:16.519 --> 06:18.160
-Um.

06:18.199 --> 06:19.639
Yeah, I can't do that.

06:19.680 --> 06:20.279
-Sure you can.

06:20.319 --> 06:21.800
I've seen you dance.

06:21.839 --> 06:25.319
-No, I don't want to do that.

06:25.360 --> 06:27.560
It's crap.

06:27.600 --> 06:29.560
-[scoff].

06:29.600 --> 06:32.360
What's wrong with it?

06:32.399 --> 06:34.079
-Turf war?

06:34.120 --> 06:35.199
Dance-off in a club.

06:35.240 --> 06:37.600
I mean, when does that happen?

06:37.639 --> 06:40.680
And Isabelle, no offense,
but you're a ballerina.

06:40.720 --> 06:41.639
You have no booty.

06:41.680 --> 06:43.639
-I should hope not.

06:43.680 --> 06:45.399
-It's like some bad LA
wannabe rip-off.

06:45.439 --> 06:46.600
-Well, that's hip-hop.

07:15.879 --> 07:18.360
He's awesome.

07:18.399 --> 07:19.600
-Hey, ballet boy.

07:19.639 --> 07:20.920
-Who's that?

07:20.959 --> 07:22.199
That's Kayla. the one you should
be looking out for.

07:51.879 --> 07:53.319
SAM (OFFSCREEN): Kat,
it's not going away.

07:53.360 --> 07:54.319
KAT (OFFSCREEN):
Sad, but true.

07:54.360 --> 07:55.600
SAM (OFFSCREEN): So
why hassle her?

07:55.639 --> 07:58.199
-Ah, if Ethan had even noticed
her, he would have

07:58.240 --> 07:59.240
made a move by now.

07:59.279 --> 08:00.560
I'm just trying to save
her the pain.

08:00.600 --> 08:01.680
-Just let her have her crush.

08:01.720 --> 08:03.319
-Oh, I so don't get the
whole crush thing.

08:03.360 --> 08:04.600
-Oh, yeah.

08:04.639 --> 08:05.319
Sure.

08:05.360 --> 08:07.319
-Yeah.

08:07.360 --> 08:08.360
-Really?

08:08.399 --> 08:09.600
-Really.

08:17.519 --> 08:19.120
-Like really?

08:19.160 --> 08:20.319
-Yes.

08:22.879 --> 08:26.519
-So you've never had someone
really close?

08:29.639 --> 08:33.720
Someone you see every day?

08:33.759 --> 08:37.039
Like you're working with them
and you're sitting next to

08:37.080 --> 08:38.480
each other.

08:38.519 --> 08:40.759
And I mean, you're breathing in
the same air that they're

08:40.799 --> 08:42.558
breathing out.

08:42.600 --> 08:43.519
And--

08:43.558 --> 08:46.399
-And you know all
this because?

08:46.440 --> 08:51.159
-Look, all I'm saying is that
we don't have control over

08:51.200 --> 08:52.320
these feelings, even
when they're wrong.

08:55.840 --> 09:00.720
Sometimes, they just
eat away at you.

09:00.759 --> 09:02.480
-Sounds painful.

09:02.519 --> 09:04.679
-Yes, torture.

09:04.720 --> 09:05.200
TARA (OFFSCREEN): Hey.

09:05.240 --> 09:05.600
-Oh.

09:05.639 --> 09:06.440
Oh.

09:06.480 --> 09:08.480
-What you guys talking about?

09:08.519 --> 09:11.759
[beeping]

09:11.799 --> 09:13.159
-Oh.

09:13.200 --> 09:13.720
Got to go.

09:13.759 --> 09:15.440
-Where?

09:15.480 --> 09:16.240
-Rehearsal studio.

09:16.279 --> 09:16.679
-Why?

09:16.720 --> 09:20.360
-Yes, why?

09:20.399 --> 09:22.320
-No, give it back.

09:22.360 --> 09:24.080
What are you doing?

09:24.120 --> 09:25.440
Give me back my phone.

09:25.480 --> 09:26.120
-What is it?

09:26.159 --> 09:27.240
-It's Ethan's schedule.

09:27.279 --> 09:27.879
-Stop it--

09:27.919 --> 09:28.519
-Every class he has.

09:28.559 --> 09:29.399
Where he has lunch.

09:29.440 --> 09:31.279
Every stupid thing.

09:31.320 --> 09:31.799
-No.

09:31.840 --> 09:32.840
-Give it back.

09:32.879 --> 09:34.159
-No, this is way more
than disturbing.

09:34.200 --> 09:36.559
-Yeah, this is like psycho
stalking, Tara.

09:36.600 --> 09:37.200
-Sammy, please.

09:37.240 --> 09:37.720
Give it back.

09:37.759 --> 09:38.360
-Wait a minute.

09:38.399 --> 09:38.879
Wait a minute.

09:38.919 --> 09:39.559
Oh, it's gone.

09:39.600 --> 09:40.240
There you go.

09:40.279 --> 09:40.799
-It's deleted.

09:40.840 --> 09:41.480
-There you go.

09:41.519 --> 09:42.039
No more list.

09:42.080 --> 09:42.679
Bye, Tara.

09:57.080 --> 09:58.240
-Amazing.

10:10.639 --> 10:11.799
-You're up.

10:15.480 --> 10:17.360
-We're going to be YouTube
stars, bro.

10:17.399 --> 10:18.399
You got some nice tricks.

10:18.440 --> 10:20.159
-Oh, thanks.

10:20.200 --> 10:21.639
-How'd you do that
turning jump?

10:21.679 --> 10:23.039
I loved that.

10:23.080 --> 10:25.799
-Uh, I don't know.

10:25.840 --> 10:28.600
-See, you put your weight
on your left leg, right?

10:28.639 --> 10:30.440
-I never really thought
of it that way.

10:30.480 --> 10:32.399
-Well, how about I just give it
a go and you tell me where

10:32.440 --> 10:33.440
I'm going wrong.

10:33.480 --> 10:34.799
-Start with your right leg.

10:34.840 --> 10:35.720
-Yep.

10:35.759 --> 10:36.639
-[inaudible].

10:36.679 --> 10:37.600
-OK.

10:37.639 --> 10:38.159
-No.

10:38.200 --> 10:38.639
Stand up.

10:38.679 --> 10:39.480
-Yeah.

10:39.519 --> 10:40.279
And you're going to step.

10:40.320 --> 10:41.399
Take off on your right leg.

10:41.440 --> 10:42.399
-All right, let's go.

10:42.440 --> 10:43.120
-Why?

10:43.159 --> 10:44.440
-Because we're done.

10:44.480 --> 10:46.080
-We'll maybe catch
up some time?

11:01.200 --> 11:04.320
-Have you noticed anything
weird about Sammy?

11:04.360 --> 11:06.639
-Apart from the usual?

11:06.679 --> 11:08.120
-I've got this--

11:08.159 --> 11:10.159
uh, it's nothing.

11:10.200 --> 11:12.440
TARA (OFFSCREEN): What?

11:12.480 --> 11:14.360
-I've got this feeling.

11:14.399 --> 11:17.840
I don't know, maybe I'm reading
it really wrong.

11:17.879 --> 11:20.120
I just--

11:20.159 --> 11:21.799
-Use your words.

11:21.840 --> 11:25.279
KAT (OFFSCREEN): I hate
to use this one.

11:25.320 --> 11:29.799
I think he's got
a crush on me.

11:29.840 --> 11:30.840
-What?

11:30.879 --> 11:33.480
-He pretty much admitted
it at lunchtime.

11:33.519 --> 11:34.720
-No way.

11:34.759 --> 11:38.320
-I'm getting all the signals.

11:38.360 --> 11:39.679
-Is that flirting?

11:43.519 --> 11:44.200
This is bad.

11:44.240 --> 11:45.559
-I know.

11:45.600 --> 11:47.159
-Mr. Lieberman.

11:47.200 --> 11:49.399
-Never, ever date a friend.

11:49.440 --> 11:50.399
Ever.

11:50.440 --> 11:50.759
TARA (OFFSCREEN): Even
I know that.

11:50.799 --> 11:51.720
-Ladies.

11:54.720 --> 11:56.559
And lifting up through
the feet.

11:56.600 --> 12:00.159
-Well, maybe it's not
a real crush.

12:00.200 --> 12:02.039
You know, like is it just
a passing thought?

12:02.080 --> 12:04.600
Or, do you reckon it's a real in
your DNA, internal GPS that

12:04.639 --> 12:07.120
tells you whenever he's close
by, a full-blown obsession?

12:07.159 --> 12:07.639
-Sounds complicated.

12:07.679 --> 12:08.600
-No, not really.

12:08.639 --> 12:09.879
OK.

12:09.919 --> 12:11.120
Do you know if he's doing
the whole fantasy thing?

12:11.159 --> 12:11.720
-Tara, yuck.

12:11.759 --> 12:12.519
What?

12:12.559 --> 12:13.840
-No, I don't mean like that.

12:13.879 --> 12:16.279
I mean, crush movie.

12:16.320 --> 12:19.039
You know, when you replay
every significant moment

12:19.080 --> 12:21.519
you've ever had with the object
of your crush, which in

12:21.559 --> 12:22.200
my case--

12:22.240 --> 12:23.080
-I know who it is.

12:23.120 --> 12:23.720
MISS RAINE (OFFSCREEN):
Katrina.

12:34.480 --> 12:36.799
CHRISTIAN (OFFSCREEN): Is this
your mom's collection?

12:36.840 --> 12:37.639
-You can't insult me.

12:37.679 --> 12:39.039
I'm not listening.

12:41.519 --> 12:43.600
TARA (OFFSCREEN): What about
the fight fantasy?

12:43.639 --> 12:45.559
-OK, I'm almost to
afraid to ask.

12:45.600 --> 12:46.320
-It's good.

12:46.360 --> 12:46.960
So there's been a fight.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.200
Over you, of course.

12:48.240 --> 12:49.240
-Of course.

12:49.279 --> 12:51.480
-Trust me, this is one
of my favorites.

12:51.519 --> 12:55.200
So he's been in this big fight
and he's pretty hurt.

12:55.240 --> 13:00.320
Torn shirt, cut lip, which
is when we both realize--

13:00.360 --> 13:04.720
-That you are in desperate
need of help.

13:04.759 --> 13:06.080
Ugh.

13:08.679 --> 13:10.440
-What's this?

13:10.480 --> 13:14.639
-"Carmen's Habanera."

13:14.679 --> 13:16.159
-Now, that's awesome.

13:19.519 --> 13:21.519
That unrequited love.

13:21.559 --> 13:24.159
And she just takes your
breathe away, this

13:24.200 --> 13:26.320
gorgeous rich girl.

13:26.360 --> 13:29.159
Totally out of your
league, right?

13:29.200 --> 13:31.720
But you both know all
that doesn't matter.

13:31.759 --> 13:33.480
You just have to be together.

13:33.519 --> 13:36.519
So you break the rules,
start something new.

13:46.639 --> 13:47.559
-He's here.

13:47.600 --> 13:49.759
-Who's here?

13:49.799 --> 13:50.759
-Ethan.

13:50.799 --> 13:52.320
I told you, it's the
internal GPS.

13:52.360 --> 13:55.600
OK, there's this magnetic
pole inside me that

13:55.639 --> 13:56.600
swings towards him.

13:56.639 --> 13:57.679
Seriously, it can be
like kilometers.

13:57.720 --> 13:58.480
-OK, enough.

13:58.519 --> 13:59.679
He's my brother.

13:59.720 --> 14:02.600
No more Ethan.

14:02.639 --> 14:05.039
-Hey, Tara.

14:05.080 --> 14:06.279
Thanks for the CD.

14:06.320 --> 14:10.120
I'm actually using one of
the tracks tomorrow.

14:10.159 --> 14:11.600
-Doesn't change a thing.

14:22.559 --> 14:24.080
-Oh, there you are.

14:24.120 --> 14:25.200
-Here I am.

14:25.240 --> 14:27.200
-Is that today's is it?

14:27.240 --> 14:29.039
-Mm-hmm.

14:29.080 --> 14:30.519
-Nice.

14:30.559 --> 14:30.879
-Yeah.

14:30.919 --> 14:31.600
Ugly.

14:31.639 --> 14:32.399
Ugly dancer's feet.

14:32.440 --> 14:33.480
Look at them.

14:33.519 --> 14:34.799
Blisters, blood.

14:34.840 --> 14:38.159
They're nasty.

14:38.200 --> 14:39.440
-Look, Kat.

14:39.480 --> 14:41.360
I've been wanting to talk
to you about something.

14:41.399 --> 14:44.480
And I've been putting
it off for too long.

14:44.519 --> 14:45.960
And--

14:46.000 --> 14:49.039
I didn't want to make thinks
awkward between us, you know?

14:49.080 --> 14:53.120
So I've decided to just jump
in and tell you exactly how

14:53.159 --> 14:53.480
I'm feeling.

14:53.519 --> 14:54.159
-Oh, OK.

14:54.200 --> 14:55.159
Stop, stop, stop.

14:55.200 --> 14:56.320
-What?

14:58.279 --> 15:00.240
-I love you, Sammy.

15:00.279 --> 15:03.200
Just not like that.

15:03.240 --> 15:05.399
At all.

15:05.440 --> 15:06.639
-What?

15:10.440 --> 15:11.600
Oh.

15:14.679 --> 15:15.799
Gross.

15:28.840 --> 15:29.799
-Tara.

15:29.840 --> 15:31.320
Sorry, darling.

15:31.360 --> 15:33.559
-Kat, what?

15:33.600 --> 15:35.559
-So I just spoke to Sammy and he
has got a crush on someone,

15:35.600 --> 15:36.639
only it's not me.

15:36.679 --> 15:37.480
-So who is it?

15:37.519 --> 15:38.320
-It's you.

15:38.360 --> 15:39.840
-No way.

15:39.879 --> 15:41.279
-Well, when we first spoke, he
said something about breathing

15:41.320 --> 15:42.279
in the same air that the other
person was breathing out.

15:42.320 --> 15:43.399
-Sounds like something
I would say.

15:43.440 --> 15:43.840
Oh, no.

15:43.879 --> 15:45.799
-Oh, yes.

15:45.840 --> 15:47.159
-Oh, crap.

15:53.639 --> 15:55.799
Look, before you say anything,
let me just say this.

15:55.840 --> 15:57.840
-Things look like they could
be progressing with Ethan.

15:57.879 --> 16:00.120
And I'm not saying we're going
to get together right away,

16:00.159 --> 16:01.799
but I just think he's--
you know.

16:01.840 --> 16:04.320
So I'm really flattered, and--

16:04.360 --> 16:06.480
we're just so similar, which
makes us really great friends.

16:06.519 --> 16:09.399
-Which is why I'm not
interested in you.

16:09.440 --> 16:10.600
Or Kat.

16:13.519 --> 16:14.679
Women.

16:22.720 --> 16:24.720
-I booked this studio.

16:24.759 --> 16:26.799
-I'll just be a couple
minutes.

16:26.840 --> 16:29.480
-There's a reservation
for, you know?

16:29.519 --> 16:30.679
CHRISTIAN (OFFSCREEN):
Yeah, whatever.

16:34.759 --> 16:36.480
-You know, being good at
hip-hop's never going to make

16:36.519 --> 16:37.639
you a better ballet dancer.

16:37.679 --> 16:38.799
-Yeah?

16:38.840 --> 16:39.799
And what makes you think
that's what I want?

16:39.840 --> 16:41.120
-Then why are you here?

16:41.159 --> 16:42.840
It's Sunday.

16:42.879 --> 16:44.440
Who you trying to impress?

16:49.440 --> 16:50.120
-You know what?

16:50.159 --> 16:50.799
The studio's yours.

16:56.720 --> 16:58.000
-Hey.

16:58.039 --> 16:59.120
Heard you're going to be doing
Ethan's chory later.

16:59.159 --> 17:01.440
You know that was my role.

17:01.480 --> 17:02.519
-No, I didn't.

17:02.559 --> 17:03.200
-Yeah.

17:03.240 --> 17:03.720
Well, you know?

17:03.759 --> 17:04.519
Groin strain.

17:04.559 --> 17:05.598
So--

17:05.640 --> 17:07.400
-Tragedy for us all.

17:07.440 --> 17:10.640
You did me such a favor.

17:10.680 --> 17:12.759
Hey, you know, when you first
got here, I thought, are they

17:12.799 --> 17:14.598
just giving this guy a
place out of charity?

17:14.640 --> 17:15.640
You know, we all did.

17:15.680 --> 17:17.039
We were wrong about
you, Christian.

17:17.079 --> 17:18.720
You really deserve to be here.

17:18.759 --> 17:20.640
-Can I borrow him for
a sec, Belle?

17:20.680 --> 17:21.279
-Yeah.

17:21.319 --> 17:21.799
Hey, how you doing?

17:21.839 --> 17:23.240
Good?

17:23.279 --> 17:24.799
So I don't know if you know, but
my dad's a choreographer,

17:24.839 --> 17:27.319
which means that this whole
thing is a lot more important

17:27.358 --> 17:28.319
than just the marks, yeah?

17:28.358 --> 17:29.839
There's other pressures.

17:29.880 --> 17:30.839
-Good luck, Ethan.

17:30.880 --> 17:33.480
-Yeah, thanks.

17:33.519 --> 17:34.599
They all want me to fail.

17:34.640 --> 17:36.519
But you don't need to
worry about that.

17:36.559 --> 17:39.480
Kennedy was really anti me using
a first year, but I knew

17:39.519 --> 17:40.640
I was right.

17:40.680 --> 17:44.039
You've really come up
with the goods, man.

17:44.079 --> 17:44.799
-Whoa.

17:44.839 --> 17:46.400
-OK, sure.

17:46.440 --> 17:47.640
See you in there, champ.

18:02.240 --> 18:12.279
[phone ringing]

18:12.319 --> 18:22.319
[phone ringing]

18:22.359 --> 18:28.599
[phone ringing]

18:28.640 --> 18:30.319
-I don't know what's
happened to him.

18:30.359 --> 18:31.400
I don't understand.

18:31.440 --> 18:33.319
He was really keen,
wasn't he, Belle?

18:33.359 --> 18:35.680
-He came to rehearsals.

18:35.720 --> 18:37.400
-Look, it doesn't matter.

18:37.440 --> 18:39.759
I just need a little bit of
extra time to find another

18:39.799 --> 18:40.920
dancer.

18:40.960 --> 18:42.039
-I'll put you down for
the end of the day.

18:42.079 --> 18:43.240
-Thank you, sir.

18:43.279 --> 18:45.160
-Choreography isn't just
about the steps, Ethan.

18:45.200 --> 18:46.799
It's also about casting.

18:46.839 --> 18:50.799
It's about choosing the right
dancer for the right role.

18:50.839 --> 18:52.319
-I can't believe he'd
do this to you.

18:52.359 --> 18:53.720
You never should have
trusted him.

18:57.720 --> 18:58.640
-The girl from the video.

18:58.680 --> 19:00.480
She could do it easy.

19:00.519 --> 19:02.240
I just have to cut out
the ballet moves.

19:02.279 --> 19:03.839
-Isn't it meant to
be a love story?

19:13.519 --> 19:15.440
-Get off me.

19:15.480 --> 19:16.440
TARA (OFFSCREEN): Not
till you tell us.

19:16.480 --> 19:17.400
-Tell you what?

19:17.440 --> 19:18.799
-Who you've got a
crush no. on.

19:18.839 --> 19:20.720
-If it's not me and it's not
Kat, who else could it be?

19:20.759 --> 19:22.039
-Collegiates?

19:22.079 --> 19:22.519
Camilla?

19:22.559 --> 19:23.480
-Let it go.

19:23.519 --> 19:24.839
-There's only one
way out of this.

19:24.880 --> 19:25.559
-Soraya?

19:25.599 --> 19:26.279
Bunny?

19:26.319 --> 19:27.039
-Guys, just drop it.

19:27.079 --> 19:28.400
I really--

19:28.440 --> 19:29.400
-I know.

19:29.440 --> 19:29.920
I know.

19:29.960 --> 19:31.160
It's Abigail.

19:34.279 --> 19:37.599
Imagine Sammy and Abigail.

19:37.640 --> 19:39.160
-Abigail.

19:39.200 --> 19:41.599
[laughter]

19:47.440 --> 19:48.400
-You can't be serious?

19:48.440 --> 19:49.759
-I didn't mean for
it to happen.

19:53.240 --> 19:54.440
Kat.

19:56.720 --> 19:57.319
-Traitor.

19:57.359 --> 19:58.559
-Sorry, OK?

19:58.599 --> 20:05.079
But, oh, she just
drives me crazy.

20:05.119 --> 20:06.720
And the heart just goes
where it goes.

20:06.759 --> 20:08.119
Tara?

20:11.319 --> 20:12.640
-I don't know.

20:12.680 --> 20:13.960
I mean, I know I can do it.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.319
I just don't know if I can learn
it all in two hours.

20:16.359 --> 20:17.799
-Well, they're all your
steps, Kayla.

20:17.839 --> 20:19.359
I based it on what you
were doing yesterday.

20:19.400 --> 20:20.599
-Seriously?

20:20.640 --> 20:22.599
-Come on.

20:22.640 --> 20:25.440
I'll show you, but then
we have to get going.

20:25.480 --> 20:26.200
All right?

20:26.240 --> 20:27.200
-Yo.

20:27.240 --> 20:28.799
It's the rich boy.

20:28.839 --> 20:31.319
Come back for another visit to
the people zoo, have you?

20:36.839 --> 20:38.799
ISABELLE (OFFSCREEN):
Where have you been?

20:38.839 --> 20:40.440
CHRISTIAN (OFFSCREEN):
Good surf.

20:40.480 --> 20:41.480
-And what about Ethan?

20:41.519 --> 20:45.200
You let him down.

20:45.240 --> 20:47.279
-I don't owe him anything
anymore.

20:47.319 --> 20:48.480
ISABELLE (OFFSCREEN):
So that's it?

20:50.480 --> 20:52.039
That's fine, he's got someone
to replace you anyway.

20:52.079 --> 20:53.680
He's due back with
her any minute.

20:56.640 --> 20:58.440
-Her?

20:58.480 --> 21:00.359
-Afraid she'll be better?

21:00.400 --> 21:01.599
You should know, you
introduced them.

21:14.880 --> 21:16.599
-What do you think?

21:16.640 --> 21:17.680
-I think you look stupid.

21:17.720 --> 21:20.200
-I think it suits me.

21:20.240 --> 21:21.519
What do you think?

21:21.559 --> 21:22.240
-Looks brilliant.

21:22.279 --> 21:23.440
Looks amazing.

21:23.480 --> 21:24.039
You know what?

21:24.079 --> 21:24.519
You keep it.

21:24.559 --> 21:25.599
It's yours.

21:25.640 --> 21:26.680
-No, give it back.

21:26.720 --> 21:27.319
-Look, he can have it.

21:27.359 --> 21:27.799
Let's just go.

21:27.839 --> 21:28.759
-What?

21:28.799 --> 21:29.559
So you're bored with
us already?

21:29.599 --> 21:30.279
Nice watch.

21:30.319 --> 21:31.599
Think it's a Rolex.

21:31.640 --> 21:33.720
-It's a pirate, idiot.

21:33.759 --> 21:36.279
It's a fake, just like you.

21:36.319 --> 21:37.839
-Ethan.

21:37.880 --> 21:41.160
-Tweak, just let it go.

21:41.200 --> 21:42.799
-Come on, let's go.

21:42.839 --> 21:44.720
-So I'm a fake now, am I?

21:44.759 --> 21:46.119
-Total hip-hop wannabe.

22:07.880 --> 22:08.799
What do you think?

22:08.839 --> 22:12.119
Do we have to tell
them we lost?

22:12.160 --> 22:13.319
-Nah.

22:21.680 --> 22:22.839
-He's here.

22:25.640 --> 22:26.799
GPS.

22:35.599 --> 22:37.480
KAT NARRATING: The first rule
of ballet is to make every

22:37.519 --> 22:40.039
single movement as beautiful
as possible.

22:42.559 --> 22:45.799
But sometimes, breaking the
rules is the only way of

22:45.839 --> 22:47.240
getting it right.

22:47.279 --> 22:50.200
So you know that fantasy
thing where he's been

22:50.240 --> 22:51.799
fighting for you?

22:51.839 --> 22:53.559
I totally get it.

22:53.599 --> 22:56.599
And once they're broken, you
can start to make your own.

22:56.640 --> 22:58.480
It's not ballet.

22:58.519 --> 23:00.640
It's something new.

23:00.680 --> 23:03.400
-You sure you can go on?

23:03.440 --> 23:04.599
-Absolutely.

23:52.640 --> 23:55.160
