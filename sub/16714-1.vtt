Previously on "Criminal Minds"...

00:01.700 --> 00:05.250
Whoever is sending these emails,
the message is always the same...

00:05.279 --> 00:06.169
"The storm breaks tonight."

00:06.171 --> 00:08.170
"The storm breaks tonight."

00:08.533 --> 00:09.806
He's planning a prison break.

00:16.900 --> 00:17.666
We got a tunnel.

00:20.634 --> 00:22.583
3 more prison breaks
in 3 different states,

00:22.653 --> 00:25.420
all organized by Rawdon's partners
from his last bombing attempt.

00:25.422 --> 00:26.421
How many got away?

00:26.423 --> 00:29.825
As of right now, 13 serial killers.

00:29.827 --> 00:31.260
So we have to catch them again.

01:21.178 --> 01:22.778
I can't... I can't...

02:13.931 --> 02:15.364
Water.

02:15.366 --> 02:17.733
Water, please.

02:21.605 --> 02:23.305
What do you think, Chief?

02:23.307 --> 02:24.406
I don't know.

02:24.408 --> 02:25.974
Do we need to call in the FBI?

02:25.976 --> 02:27.643
I don't know.

02:27.645 --> 02:29.378
It's been, what, 3 years?

02:29.380 --> 02:30.612
Officer Dewey.

02:30.614 --> 02:31.780
Yes, Chief.

02:31.782 --> 02:32.872
Shut up.

02:34.745 --> 02:35.844
How is he?

02:35.850 --> 02:37.784
You need to see this.

02:39.754 --> 02:40.753
Dewey.

02:40.755 --> 02:42.788
Yes, Chief.

02:42.790 --> 02:44.890
Call the FBI.

02:44.914 --> 02:49.795
_

03:09.183 --> 03:11.317
Manos, arriba.

03:11.319 --> 03:12.551
Â¡Arriba!

03:12.553 --> 03:14.286
I'm from the Bronx, lady.

03:14.288 --> 03:16.689
You want to do this in Spanish,
no hay problema,

03:16.691 --> 03:18.958
pero un poquito estÃºpido
porque tÃº no hablas español.

03:18.960 --> 03:21.327
You have it?

03:21.329 --> 03:23.929
En inglés? Yes.

03:23.931 --> 03:26.165
Slowly.

03:31.405 --> 03:32.871
On the hood.

03:37.511 --> 03:40.312
Everything you need to
pass as a Mexican citizen.

03:40.314 --> 03:43.182
Driver's license, passports,

03:43.281 --> 03:46.631
even an IMSS card
in case you need a doctor.

03:46.787 --> 03:49.355
But you ordered two.

03:53.961 --> 03:56.229
You mind?

04:11.712 --> 04:13.045
We good, sugar?

04:13.047 --> 04:14.480
All good, baby.

04:14.482 --> 04:17.483
That's half of what we paid for.

04:17.485 --> 04:18.851
Where's the other half?

04:18.853 --> 04:21.286
I'm going to reach into my back pocket.

04:21.288 --> 04:25.024
But... I'm not pulling out out a gun.

04:30.731 --> 04:32.498
This way.

04:55.690 --> 04:59.458
You take that, you come out on
the other end just outside of Socorro.

04:59.535 --> 05:00.568
You're coming with us.

05:00.980 --> 05:02.780
That wasn't part of the deal.

05:02.818 --> 05:03.917
It is now.

05:09.658 --> 05:11.291
- Guess I'll go first.
- No.

05:13.462 --> 05:16.196
Babe, you go down first,
wait for us at the bottom.

05:16.198 --> 05:18.965
Then you go I'll bring up the rear.

05:18.967 --> 05:20.634
Earl, it's dark down there.

05:20.636 --> 05:22.769
Your cell phone has a light. Use it.

05:25.607 --> 05:26.773
Get going.

05:32.381 --> 05:34.765
Where'd you escape from prison?

05:35.084 --> 05:36.805
Make a difference?

05:37.052 --> 05:39.353
Not as long as I get paid.

05:39.655 --> 05:41.655
Honey, how we doin'?

05:43.492 --> 05:45.192
Carla Jean!

05:45.194 --> 05:48.161
I'm good. I'm down.

05:48.163 --> 05:50.530
Can we send down our boy?

05:50.532 --> 05:53.700
Yeah, baby.

05:53.702 --> 05:55.102
Send him down.

05:56.405 --> 05:57.404
Uh-uh!

05:57.406 --> 05:59.039
Wait.

06:00.976 --> 06:04.478
Babe, turn your light on,

06:04.480 --> 06:07.080
so we can see down at the bottom.

06:09.284 --> 06:12.419
Show me the damn light.

06:12.421 --> 06:13.587
Good?

06:17.359 --> 06:19.493
FBI!

06:19.495 --> 06:20.995
Don't move!

06:30.239 --> 06:32.372
You know, you didn't need to risk it.

06:32.374 --> 06:33.774
We had sharpshooters on you.

06:33.776 --> 06:35.976
Yeah. Shooters miss.

06:35.978 --> 06:38.044
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a second.

06:38.046 --> 06:39.813
I mean, I know
everything is digital now,

06:39.815 --> 06:43.150
but I still like to do this old school.

06:43.152 --> 06:44.184
How many we got left?

06:44.186 --> 06:45.252
Well, let's see.

06:45.254 --> 06:48.155
13 serial killers escaped
from prison in May.

06:48.157 --> 06:51.892
With your help, we're down to 5.

06:51.894 --> 06:53.727
So how come you're not
on our team full-time?

06:53.729 --> 06:55.395
Yeah, I told Agent Hotchner,

06:55.397 --> 06:56.897
I'm a manhunter.

06:56.899 --> 06:58.432
I'm no good to you as a profiler.

06:58.434 --> 07:00.767
You're with the FBI's
fugitive task force.

07:00.769 --> 07:03.804
From where I'm standing,
you've done us a whole lot of good.

07:03.806 --> 07:06.206
Rossi, I appreciate the offer. I do.

07:06.208 --> 07:09.009
But I can't sit around
brainstorming about these guys.

07:09.011 --> 07:10.410
I need the chase.

07:11.847 --> 07:13.380
Fair enough.

07:14.683 --> 07:18.118
Oh, we think he's back in Tempe.

07:18.120 --> 07:21.354
He, uh, let a survivor go this morning.

07:21.356 --> 07:23.890
In an arm spreader.

07:25.194 --> 07:27.394
Daniel Cullen.

07:33.702 --> 07:35.168
When do we start?

07:35.170 --> 07:37.338
We just did.

07:39.374 --> 07:42.676
Chief, how much do you know
about Daniel James Cullen?

07:42.678 --> 07:44.244
You mean the Crimson King?

07:44.246 --> 07:47.314
I know he liked to cut words
into his victims' bodies.

07:47.316 --> 07:50.684
3 years ago
your Phoenix field office arrested him.

07:50.686 --> 07:53.153
That's why we didn't
call you in last time.

07:53.155 --> 07:56.022
Has his most recent
victim said anything?

07:56.024 --> 07:57.958
He just woke up.

08:00.963 --> 08:04.731
Ryan, these folks are with the FBI.

08:04.733 --> 08:06.299
Would you mind?

08:15.177 --> 08:16.977
Do you know what it means?

08:16.979 --> 08:18.579
Yes, we do.

08:23.352 --> 08:25.801

09:03.533 --> 09:05.600
Then we visited the Louvres
and the Eiffel tower,

09:05.602 --> 09:07.602
and the best part of all
was that on the flight back

09:07.604 --> 09:09.203
Mom walked me through
every moment of it.

09:09.205 --> 09:10.505
I didn't have to prompt her.

09:10.507 --> 09:11.939
Oh, Spence, that's so great.

09:11.941 --> 09:14.909
The latest research shows that
diets high in omega-3 fatty acids

09:14.911 --> 09:17.612
help combat dementia,
which we gorged on in Paris.

09:17.614 --> 09:19.881
I mean, honestly, if she hadn't been
clinically diagnosed with Alzheimer's,

09:19.883 --> 09:21.449
I'd just think she was
a little absent-minded.

09:21.451 --> 09:22.950
So are you gonna keep
her in the same facility?

09:22.952 --> 09:24.419
Yeah, she really likes it there.

09:24.421 --> 09:26.721
What did I miss while I was gone?
Tell me about Agent Alvez.

09:26.723 --> 09:28.456
Uh, well, um, let's see,

09:28.458 --> 09:30.124
he bounced between different divisions

09:30.126 --> 09:31.693
before joining the fugitive task force.

09:31.695 --> 09:33.628
Former army ranger, right?

09:33.630 --> 09:35.763
Covered most of Iraq's worst hellholes.

09:35.765 --> 09:37.899
He's a first in, last out kind of guy.

09:37.901 --> 09:40.134
What does Garcia think about him?

09:47.544 --> 09:49.110
Hey.

09:49.112 --> 09:51.312
Good morning.

09:52.649 --> 09:56.384
Uh, how was your weekend?

09:56.386 --> 09:59.887
I don't really discuss
my personal life with my co-workers.

09:59.889 --> 10:01.456
Really?

10:01.658 --> 10:04.058
Yeah. I keep it real low-profile here.

10:06.963 --> 10:10.798
If you must know,
I hung out with my boyfriend,

10:10.800 --> 10:13.969
who is super hot and awesome
and totally in love with me.

10:14.771 --> 10:17.972
That's cool. You guys go out or...

10:17.974 --> 10:19.841
No. We stayed in and he helped me

10:19.843 --> 10:22.243
with some fingering techniques.

10:22.245 --> 10:25.146
For my clarinet,
which I practice and he helps me,

10:25.148 --> 10:27.548
and this conversation
is making me uncomfortable,

10:27.550 --> 10:29.083
and I'm sorry, I must go.

10:29.085 --> 10:31.319
Agent Hotchner needs me.

10:31.321 --> 10:32.553
I made lasagna.

10:32.555 --> 10:34.056
I do not care.

10:55.378 --> 10:57.311
That's the last batch, guys.

10:57.313 --> 10:59.314
Garcia, did the pictures come through?

10:59.816 --> 11:01.783
Yes, sir, they are coming in loud

11:01.785 --> 11:03.384
and disconcertingly clear.

11:03.386 --> 11:04.352
This is it.

11:04.354 --> 11:06.387
You compare pictures of the old victims

11:06.389 --> 11:08.189
with pictures of the new victims,

11:08.191 --> 11:10.224
- and see what's different?
- Hotch.

11:10.226 --> 11:11.359
- You see it?
- Yes.

11:11.561 --> 11:13.928
- See what?
- Garcia, we need everybody.

11:14.030 --> 11:15.363
Will do.

11:18.597 --> 11:20.132
What do you guys see?

11:21.494 --> 11:22.808
_

11:24.491 --> 11:26.691
Hey.

11:26.699 --> 11:27.965
Luke Alvez.

11:27.967 --> 11:29.667
Oh, hi. I'm Dr. Spencer Reid.

11:29.728 --> 11:31.060
Ah. No handshaking, right?

11:31.062 --> 11:32.929
Your, uh, reputation precedes you.

11:32.931 --> 11:34.964
So does yours. It says here that
you caught our next fugitive,

11:34.966 --> 11:37.333
Daniel Cullen, 3 years ago.
During his sentencing statement

11:37.335 --> 11:39.435
he said, "I don't kill
because I don't have to."

11:39.437 --> 11:41.751
He sounds like an injustice collector.
How'd you finally catch him?

11:41.751 --> 11:44.085
Cullen was always a suspect.
We just couldn't get an I.D.

11:44.087 --> 11:46.954
So, uh, my partner
went deep cover, and...

11:46.956 --> 11:48.956
We caught him in the act.

11:49.926 --> 11:52.593
After I heard how he broke out in may,

11:52.595 --> 11:54.495
I wanted to be the one
to put him away again.

11:54.497 --> 11:56.931
There might be a flag on that play.

11:56.933 --> 11:58.366
Go ahead, Hotch, we're all here.

11:58.368 --> 12:00.534
The details of the Cullen case
are all the same except for one.

12:00.536 --> 12:02.536
The cuts on the latest
victim are shallow

12:02.538 --> 12:04.171
and show definite hesitation marks.

12:04.173 --> 12:06.107
It doesn't make sense.
From his first victim,

12:06.109 --> 12:08.442
Cullen inflicted
as much pain as possible.

12:08.444 --> 12:10.845
And prison would have made him mean.
They're not nice there.

12:10.847 --> 12:12.413
Brian Phillips doesn't match
Cullen's previous

12:12.415 --> 12:14.014
injustice collector victimology,

12:14.016 --> 12:15.883
and the message at this time
is "BAU" when we had nothing

12:15.885 --> 12:18.219
to do with his initial
arrest 3 years ago.

12:18.221 --> 12:20.054
So, look, maybe he met someone in prison

12:20.056 --> 12:22.022
and told them all about
us, but more likely...

12:22.024 --> 12:23.324
This isn't Daniel Cullen.

12:23.326 --> 12:25.393
It's a very sophisticated copycat.

12:26.496 --> 12:28.996
Agent Alvez,
this isn't the case you signed up for,

12:28.998 --> 12:30.831
but your history with it
will still be an asset.

12:30.833 --> 12:32.099
If someone's out there copying Cullen,

12:32.101 --> 12:34.835
it could still lead us to him,
and I want in on that.

12:34.837 --> 12:36.604
I need everyone to look
for any other discrepancies

12:36.606 --> 12:39.607
between the copycat and Cullen. Tara's
gonna interview the latest victim

12:39.609 --> 12:41.175
and see what he remembers.

12:46.616 --> 12:49.116
Does it itch?

12:49.118 --> 12:50.651
So bad.

12:53.956 --> 12:57.458
When I was 12,

12:57.460 --> 13:01.061
I came home from summer camp

13:01.063 --> 13:05.266
and two of my closest friends,

13:05.268 --> 13:06.700
they had moved away.

13:07.929 --> 13:09.246
It was the first time I noticed

13:09.330 --> 13:11.029
how quickly life can change.

13:11.031 --> 13:13.498
You think you're one thing

13:13.500 --> 13:15.934
and then you're something else.

13:17.838 --> 13:19.538
And now I'm this.

13:19.540 --> 13:23.842
This trauma, yes, it's a part of you.

13:23.844 --> 13:25.944
But it is not all of you.

13:25.946 --> 13:28.313
Help us catch the man who did this

13:28.315 --> 13:30.949
and you can take back
control of your life.

13:30.951 --> 13:32.150
How?

13:32.152 --> 13:33.552
Walk me through it.

13:33.554 --> 13:34.820
Ok?

13:34.822 --> 13:38.123
Two days ago, you clocked out from work.

13:38.125 --> 13:39.691
Where did you go?

13:39.693 --> 13:43.829
Straight home. Uh...

13:43.831 --> 13:47.866
But the door was unlocked.

13:47.868 --> 13:50.135
Before I could even think, they came.

13:50.137 --> 13:52.871
That's not right.

13:52.873 --> 13:57.376
I was out. Just... Gone.

13:59.313 --> 14:01.647
And when I woke up,

14:01.649 --> 14:04.049
I was on a table.

14:04.051 --> 14:07.152
But... I couldn't see anything.

14:07.154 --> 14:08.320
Why not?

14:08.322 --> 14:09.988
There was...

14:09.990 --> 14:12.257
Like a white plastic bag.

14:12.259 --> 14:13.692
Aah!

14:13.694 --> 14:16.528
No. No, that's not right.

14:16.530 --> 14:18.130
It's ok.

14:18.132 --> 14:19.464
Your mind makes jumps,

14:19.466 --> 14:21.433
and then you try to fill in the gaps.

14:21.435 --> 14:23.836
But... Just let it come.

14:25.839 --> 14:28.340
It was a mask.

14:28.342 --> 14:30.509
Like a gas mask,

14:30.511 --> 14:32.344
but it was painted white.

14:35.349 --> 14:38.517
No, that's not right. Um, uh, no,

14:38.519 --> 14:39.718
it was black.

14:39.720 --> 14:41.920
That's the second time

14:41.922 --> 14:44.156
that you've mentioned white.

14:44.158 --> 14:46.491
So what are you trying to remember?

14:55.135 --> 14:57.269
The smoke.

14:57.271 --> 14:59.237
The smoke was white.

15:00.474 --> 15:02.441
And then I heard him speak.

15:02.443 --> 15:03.542
Are you ready?

15:03.544 --> 15:05.811
Breathe it in.

15:05.813 --> 15:07.747
There you go.

15:08.349 --> 15:10.182
Now you're ready.

15:10.184 --> 15:12.484
Tell me, what is your name?

15:12.486 --> 15:16.188
Brian. Brian.

15:16.190 --> 15:19.658
No, you're not Brian.

15:20.928 --> 15:22.828
And then I passed out

15:22.830 --> 15:26.465
because that's when he started cutting.

15:26.467 --> 15:28.434
Ok.

15:28.836 --> 15:30.369
Tell me about the smoke.

15:30.371 --> 15:31.503
What about it?

15:31.505 --> 15:33.038
What did it smell like?

15:33.040 --> 15:34.306
What did it taste like?

15:34.308 --> 15:36.775
If we can figure out what it was,

15:36.777 --> 15:39.411
we can screen for it in your system.

15:42.783 --> 15:45.017
Bubble gum?

15:45.019 --> 15:46.151
Bubble gum?

15:46.153 --> 15:49.821
That sounds crazy, but I swear it...

15:49.823 --> 15:53.225
Yeah, it was like bubble gum.

15:53.227 --> 15:55.994
It doesn't sound crazy at all, Brian.

15:57.031 --> 15:59.798
Off of bubble gum? For real?

15:59.800 --> 16:02.267
We've seen the use
of aerosolized drugs before.

16:02.269 --> 16:04.736
One called scopolamine puts
you in a catatonic state.

16:04.738 --> 16:07.305
The other, sevoflurane,
is used during dental surgery.

16:07.307 --> 16:10.075
It puts you in a suggestible,
almost hypnotic trance.

16:10.077 --> 16:11.610
And because it's used in dental surgery,

16:11.612 --> 16:13.345
it tastes and smells like bubble gum.

16:13.347 --> 16:16.249
And that's why we think
the unsub is this guy.

16:17.651 --> 16:19.852
Mr. Scratch.

16:20.154 --> 16:21.620
Peter Lewis.

16:21.622 --> 16:23.622
He was one of the key players
in the breakout.

16:23.624 --> 16:25.657
Looks like you get to hunt
a fugitive after all,

16:25.659 --> 16:26.825
just not the one you thought.

16:26.927 --> 16:28.394
But I'm bumping on two things.

16:28.434 --> 16:31.168
Number one... Peter Lewis
should be doing everything he can

16:31.170 --> 16:33.070
to stay hidden. And number two...

16:33.072 --> 16:36.540
If he's going to surface again, why
would he copy another guy's style?

16:36.542 --> 16:39.276
He obviously has some agenda
that's not clear to us yet.

16:39.278 --> 16:41.511
But we need to consider
a more pressing problem.

16:41.513 --> 16:43.980
Peter Lewis is a math genius.

16:43.982 --> 16:45.515
Which means he plans for every variable.

16:45.517 --> 16:46.950
Why is that more pressing?

16:46.952 --> 16:48.819
Every serial killer thinks that.

16:48.821 --> 16:51.421
Yeah, but most of them operate
out of compulsion and he doesn't.

16:51.423 --> 16:53.457
He would stress test all
permutations of his plan

16:53.459 --> 16:56.026
before reappearing,
most likely on other victims.

16:56.028 --> 16:57.461
You think we're missing someone.

16:57.463 --> 16:58.729
He wouldn't release Brian

16:58.731 --> 17:01.465
unless he knew we couldn't catch him.

17:01.467 --> 17:04.401
Here I am,
the paragon of professionalism.

17:04.403 --> 17:07.938
Garcia, have there been
any suspicious murders

17:07.940 --> 17:10.440
in the Tempe-Phoenix area after Brian?

17:10.442 --> 17:13.577
Outside of the usual drug and
domestic abuse violence, no.

17:13.579 --> 17:16.579
Check 911 records,
any missing persons reports,

17:16.582 --> 17:18.415
psychotic episodes, delusions.

17:18.416 --> 17:23.019
Mm-mmm. I'm gonna check
the prank phone call bin to be sure.

17:23.021 --> 17:24.186
What is it?

17:24.189 --> 17:26.522
I've got a call here
about a Jennifer Jareau

17:26.525 --> 17:31.128
that caller listed the
address as 54321 Rossi Avenue.

17:31.130 --> 17:33.196
Wow, this guy is really
baiting us, isn't he?

17:33.198 --> 17:34.698
Ok, it came from a burner phone,

17:34.700 --> 17:37.367
but they left the GPS on.
I'm sending you the address now.

17:37.369 --> 17:39.136
No. Send it to Hotch and Tara.

17:39.138 --> 17:41.271
But let them know that Peter Lewis

17:41.273 --> 17:42.773
left the breadcrumbs on purpose.

17:42.775 --> 17:44.875
They could be walking into a trap.

17:58.423 --> 17:59.924
Police.

18:03.162 --> 18:05.495
Hotch.

18:05.497 --> 18:08.131
Hotch.

18:09.835 --> 18:12.969
Hotch.

18:12.971 --> 18:15.372
Hotch?

18:15.374 --> 18:16.640
Hotch.

18:18.977 --> 18:21.645
Hotch.

18:21.647 --> 18:23.480
Hotch.

18:23.482 --> 18:25.816
I'm Hotch.

18:35.104 --> 18:35.636
Hotch.

18:37.535 --> 18:38.569
Hotch.

18:42.588 --> 18:44.188
Her name's Chelsea Carter.

18:44.193 --> 18:46.660
That's a complete dissociative break.

18:46.662 --> 18:48.795
We're still trying to figure out
what connects her to Brian.

18:48.797 --> 18:51.331
Other than being
a year younger, nothing.

18:51.333 --> 18:53.467
Well, Peter Lewis found
a shared mental condition

18:53.469 --> 18:55.102
he could exploit.
That's his victimology.

18:55.104 --> 18:57.938
Last time he dosed men and women
who had made false accusations

18:57.940 --> 19:01.108
of satanic ritual abuse,
but that was in the mid-1980s,

19:01.110 --> 19:03.210
and Brian and Chelsea
are both far too young

19:03.212 --> 19:05.345
to have lived through that hysteria.

19:05.447 --> 19:07.281
Then they share a different condition.

19:14.957 --> 19:17.958
Well, these are all
heavy-duty anti-depressant

19:17.960 --> 19:20.227
and anti-psychotic drugs.

19:20.229 --> 19:21.495
This one's for PTSD.

19:21.497 --> 19:23.430
Now play out the scenario.

19:23.432 --> 19:25.398
Someone like her inhales
Peter Lewis' drugs.

19:25.501 --> 19:27.034
What's he trying to induce?

19:30.790 --> 19:32.024
We need to build the profile.

19:32.303 --> 19:33.803
Thank you very much.

19:35.780 --> 19:37.184
That was Chelsea Carter's psychologist.

19:37.249 --> 19:38.812
He confirmed that for the past 15 years

19:38.817 --> 19:41.018
she suffered from
dissociative identity disorder.

19:41.088 --> 19:43.188
D.I.D.? You're talking
split personality.

19:43.190 --> 19:46.558
Technically, it's an updated diagnosis
for multiple personality disorder.

19:46.560 --> 19:49.661
Both of our victims
shared the same diagnosis,

19:49.663 --> 19:52.397
and Brian has it, too.
That's a small victimology pool.

19:52.399 --> 19:55.000
One that's localized here. The
university of Tempe has a summer camp

19:55.002 --> 19:57.402
that helps kids with
dissociative disorders.

19:57.404 --> 19:59.438
And Garcia's contacting all
the doctors and administrators.

19:59.440 --> 20:00.806
It's got to be where
he's finding his victims.

20:00.808 --> 20:03.408
Yeah, but what does D.I.D. get him?

20:03.410 --> 20:04.876
He wants to manipulate their identities,

20:04.878 --> 20:06.445
and he wants a violent one.

20:06.447 --> 20:09.815
That means Peter
Lewis is not the copycat.

20:09.817 --> 20:13.118
It's someone with D.I.D. who he dosed.

20:13.120 --> 20:15.954
So he's telling this
alternate to cut his victims

20:15.956 --> 20:18.356
like the Crimson King, and he
would need to keep dosing him

20:18.358 --> 20:20.425
to maintain the illusion.

20:20.427 --> 20:22.294
Peter Lewis never liked to kill.

20:22.296 --> 20:25.063
He always got others
to do his dirty work for him.

20:25.065 --> 20:27.632
Here's the thing.
D.I.D. is a difficult disorder to treat,

20:27.634 --> 20:29.034
but it's even more difficult

20:29.036 --> 20:30.535
for a third party to control.

20:30.537 --> 20:32.537
To succeed with this
kind of experimentation,

20:32.539 --> 20:34.272
he would have had multiple failures.

20:34.274 --> 20:37.242
We are seeing that.
Brian survived the torture,

20:37.244 --> 20:39.978
and Chelsea's mind snapped from it.

20:39.980 --> 20:41.746
It begs the question, though...

20:41.748 --> 20:43.615
Why didn't Brian go crazy?

20:43.617 --> 20:46.985
Yes, ok, yes. I had D.I.D.

20:46.987 --> 20:48.220
It doesn't matter.

20:48.222 --> 20:49.855
Yes, it matters.

20:49.957 --> 20:51.857
I haven't had a break since I was 12.

20:51.859 --> 20:53.492
It's not who I am anymore.

20:53.494 --> 20:55.160
But that summer camp that you went to,

20:55.162 --> 20:56.796
did a Chelsea Carter go there?

20:58.098 --> 20:59.698
Yes.

20:59.700 --> 21:02.033
Yes, she...

21:02.035 --> 21:03.702
What happened?

21:03.704 --> 21:04.970
Is she dead?

21:04.972 --> 21:06.571
She was also attacked.

21:06.573 --> 21:09.941
This guy's trying to induce
a dissociative break.

21:09.943 --> 21:13.679
So I need you to tell me who
your alternate identities are.

21:13.881 --> 21:15.680
What? No, absolutely not.

21:15.682 --> 21:17.182
How can you even ask me that?

21:17.184 --> 21:18.650
Because it will help us
with our investigation.

21:18.652 --> 21:20.318
They're girls, all right?!

21:29.396 --> 21:31.196
My...

21:32.866 --> 21:37.469
My alternates were two little girls.

21:37.471 --> 21:40.539
They made me feel better
when I got stressed out.

21:40.541 --> 21:42.574
And I swear to God,
if you laugh at me...

21:42.576 --> 21:43.742
Brian...

21:46.446 --> 21:47.979
I'm not laughing.

21:56.523 --> 21:58.690
You know what integrative therapy is?

21:58.692 --> 22:01.560
Yes. It's also called
unification therapy.

22:01.562 --> 22:03.695
It's the best known treatment for D.I.D.

22:03.697 --> 22:06.531
When a patient recognizes his alternates

22:06.533 --> 22:08.934
as extensions of one whole.

22:08.936 --> 22:10.502
That's what they taught me at camp.

22:10.504 --> 22:13.038
And those two friends you told me about,

22:13.040 --> 22:14.439
the ones that moved away?

22:16.143 --> 22:17.943
Yeah, that was them.

22:17.945 --> 22:20.145
I need you to confirm the names
of the other kids

22:20.147 --> 22:23.682
that went to camp with you,
because they could be his next victims.

22:23.684 --> 22:27.852
It's been so long.
I can remember faces, but...

22:27.854 --> 22:29.354
If I got you a list of patients,

22:29.356 --> 22:31.890
could you try to pick out
the names you recognize?

22:31.892 --> 22:34.726
Maybe.

22:34.728 --> 22:36.561
I mean, I could try.

22:38.565 --> 22:39.564
Yeah.

22:39.566 --> 22:41.600
You got a second?

22:41.602 --> 22:42.968
Yeah, sure.

22:42.970 --> 22:43.969
May I?

22:43.971 --> 22:45.303
Yeah. Have a seat.

22:47.741 --> 22:51.109
So I'm up to speed on all the
fugitives this team is hunting,

22:51.111 --> 22:54.512
which means I read up on
all of Peter Lewis' victims.

22:54.514 --> 22:56.348
And, uh, I saw that...

22:56.350 --> 22:57.482
I was one of them.

22:57.484 --> 23:00.619
Yeah. I don't want
to know what happened.

23:00.621 --> 23:04.990
I just want to know...

23:04.992 --> 23:06.725
Don't you want to kill him?

23:06.727 --> 23:10.028
Do you want to kill Daniel Cullen?

23:10.030 --> 23:11.997
I took an oath

23:11.999 --> 23:13.765
to uphold the laws of this country.

23:13.767 --> 23:15.200
So...

23:18.205 --> 23:19.237
Yeah.

23:19.239 --> 23:21.373
Yeah, I want to kill him.

23:21.375 --> 23:22.340
Why?

23:22.342 --> 23:24.009
You read my personnel file.

23:24.011 --> 23:26.378
I want to hear your version.

23:26.380 --> 23:30.282
Ok. All right.

23:30.284 --> 23:34.386
Anyone that asks, I tell them
that we caught him in the act.

23:34.388 --> 23:36.355
Which is the truth.

23:37.591 --> 23:40.725
What I don't tell them
is that the act

23:40.727 --> 23:42.427
that I caught him in

23:42.429 --> 23:44.496
was him cutting open my partner,

23:44.498 --> 23:47.999
who he somehow figured out was FBI.

23:48.001 --> 23:52.003
"Try not to flinch."

23:52.005 --> 23:54.743
Phil told me later that's what he said.

23:55.809 --> 24:00.645
I strongly believe that men like
Daniel Cullen and Peter Lewis

24:00.647 --> 24:02.314
belong in 5-foot by 8-foot cells

24:02.316 --> 24:04.482
where they can live out
their lives as failures,

24:04.484 --> 24:07.519
instead of dying thinking that
they accomplished something.

24:07.521 --> 24:09.354
I'm not there yet.

24:09.356 --> 24:10.989
Let's talk about right now.

24:10.991 --> 24:13.692
I wanted you on this case because I know
that you're driven to find Cullen.

24:13.694 --> 24:15.193
I know that you're a good tracker.

24:15.195 --> 24:16.428
If there's something in this profile

24:16.430 --> 24:17.562
that you're not agreeing with,

24:17.564 --> 24:19.397
I'd like to know what it is.

24:19.399 --> 24:21.232
You're not gonna like it.

24:21.234 --> 24:23.368
Then everybody should hear it.

24:26.707 --> 24:28.573
You can't analyze a fugitive's actions
on the outside

24:28.575 --> 24:31.676
without taking into account
what he did on the inside.

24:31.678 --> 24:33.445
So what did Peter Lewis
do on the inside?

24:33.447 --> 24:34.579
Nothing. He was a model prisoner.

24:34.581 --> 24:36.247
No, it goes further than that.

24:36.249 --> 24:38.216
He had no contact with other convicts.

24:38.218 --> 24:41.119
He didn't join or get
pressured into a gang.

24:41.121 --> 24:43.788
When he gets out, he picks up
as if no time had passed.

24:43.790 --> 24:46.691
So he had the resources in
place before we arrested him.

24:46.693 --> 24:48.293
A safe house to stay in,

24:48.295 --> 24:50.595
backup supplies of his drugs.

24:50.597 --> 24:52.130
He could have gone
anywhere in the country.

24:52.132 --> 24:54.299
I mean, anywhere in the world, probably.

24:54.301 --> 24:56.501
Then he came here. To Tempe, Arizona?

24:56.503 --> 24:59.971
He had the highest concentration
of targets with D.I.D. here.

24:59.973 --> 25:02.974
You said he wouldn't reveal himself
until his plan was foolproof.

25:02.976 --> 25:04.275
Right? This isn't foolproof.

25:04.277 --> 25:06.745
Brian and Chelsea have been failures.

25:06.747 --> 25:10.281
But what part of his plan has worked?

25:10.283 --> 25:12.851
Us.

25:12.853 --> 25:14.919
You see where I'm going with this?

25:14.921 --> 25:18.556
Most fugitives, they do everything
they can to stay on the D.L.

25:18.558 --> 25:21.092
He's courted our attention
from the beginning.

25:21.094 --> 25:23.795
Where I keep hitting a wall is why.

25:23.797 --> 25:26.030
Especially if he already
has a list of all the kids

25:26.032 --> 25:27.132
that went to that camp.

25:27.134 --> 25:29.334
Maybe we need to
re-evaluate our presumptions.

25:29.336 --> 25:32.904
When Peter Lewis needed information
before, he hacked Quantico.

25:32.906 --> 25:34.773
Well, he can't do that again.

25:34.775 --> 25:36.775
So maybe he's going to get
his information from us.

25:36.777 --> 25:39.744
And we're compiling
the very list he would want.

25:39.746 --> 25:41.980
We know all his tricks.
We're not gonna give him the list.

25:41.982 --> 25:43.715
The police aren't.
How is he gonna get it?

25:43.717 --> 25:44.816
Brian.

25:45.018 --> 25:48.119
I asked officer Dewey
to go over the list with him

25:48.121 --> 25:49.954
once Garcia had something.

25:49.956 --> 25:52.123
Oh, god, Hotch, I'm so sorry.

25:52.125 --> 25:53.792
Yes, sir.

25:53.794 --> 25:55.427
Garcia, don't distribute the list.

25:56.630 --> 25:59.258
But... I just hit send.

25:59.261 --> 26:00.243
_

26:01.268 --> 26:03.635
Todd Emerson?

26:03.637 --> 26:05.336
No.

26:05.338 --> 26:08.373
Dustin Anderson?

26:13.180 --> 26:14.279
Yeah.

26:17.047 --> 26:20.490
When you hear the names you remember,

26:20.492 --> 26:22.859
this is what you'll do.

26:22.861 --> 26:24.460
This is what you'll do.

26:24.462 --> 26:25.662
I need a moment.

26:25.964 --> 26:27.563
Oh.

26:27.565 --> 26:30.433
Uh... Ok.

27:11.709 --> 27:14.644
Try not to flinch.

27:23.468 --> 27:24.934
He took his phone.

27:24.936 --> 27:26.970
Peter Lewis has the list.

27:26.972 --> 27:30.074
Tara, there's no way we
could have predicted this.

27:33.979 --> 27:35.979
We're shooting this bastard on sight.

27:36.058 --> 27:39.376
Chief, if you do that, we lose
our best lead on Peter Lewis.

27:39.403 --> 27:40.223
I don't care.

27:40.289 --> 27:41.888
You will care when he kills more people.

27:43.135 --> 27:44.301
Let us do our job.

27:47.039 --> 27:48.672
Well, now we know who the copycat is.

27:48.674 --> 27:50.841
What's scientifically revolutionary

27:50.843 --> 27:52.910
is that Peter Lewis isn't just inducing

27:52.912 --> 27:55.479
an already existing alternate,
he's actually creating one.

27:55.481 --> 27:58.082
Brian thinks he is the Crimson King.

27:58.084 --> 28:00.150
That's undocumented
in D.I.D. literature.

28:00.152 --> 28:02.653
It is possible with the right balance
of drugs and torture.

28:03.572 --> 28:05.561
Peter Lewis never tortured before.

28:05.561 --> 28:08.829
He does mentally, by
hypnotizing his victims into self-harm.

28:08.831 --> 28:10.564
It explains Brian's shallow wounds.

28:11.937 --> 28:13.504
Tara, you mean he cut himself?

28:14.029 --> 28:15.699
It was all there
in the story that he told me.

28:15.699 --> 28:16.759
I just didn't see it.

28:16.862 --> 28:18.429
D.I.D. is usually the result of trauma.

28:18.431 --> 28:20.331
If Peter Lewis could build
an alternate like this

28:20.333 --> 28:22.433
through hypnotic suggestion,
it means that Brian

28:22.435 --> 28:24.835
has some propensity
for psychopathy in his past.

28:25.738 --> 28:27.672
Tell me, what's your name?

28:28.625 --> 28:29.450
Brian.

28:29.563 --> 28:31.963
No. You're not Brian.

28:38.872 --> 28:41.005
You are the Crimson King,

28:41.007 --> 28:44.309
and you're going to cut into Brian.

28:49.130 --> 28:50.730
Lewis, did you
locate the parents?

28:50.732 --> 28:51.798
Yeah.

28:51.800 --> 28:53.297
All right. See what kind of history
you can get from them.

28:53.374 --> 28:55.256
The rest of us need to look
at every clue again

28:55.347 --> 28:57.035
through the prism of Brian
as Trojan horse.

28:57.255 --> 28:58.989
Where's the evidence room?

29:04.237 --> 29:08.038
So, this. Why would Peter Lewis
make Brian wear it?

29:08.040 --> 29:09.840
So we wouldn't question
that he was a victim.

29:09.842 --> 29:12.409
It worked, huh?

29:12.411 --> 29:14.812
Cullen hand-made his.
Peter Lewis knew that.

29:14.814 --> 29:18.215
Knew enough to copy
the lock bolt mechanism.

29:18.217 --> 29:20.784
Not enough to sew it himself.

29:20.786 --> 29:23.754
A machine stitched this.

29:23.756 --> 29:26.491
So he had to order it.

29:28.794 --> 29:30.394
Ready and waiting.

29:30.396 --> 29:32.596
Garcia, we need leather experts

29:32.598 --> 29:34.231
in the Phoenix and Tempe area.

29:34.233 --> 29:36.967
Yeah, I think the leather experts
might have asked too many questions.

29:36.969 --> 29:39.536
Uh, Garcia, if you don't
mind checking sex shops

29:39.538 --> 29:43.209
and BDSM specialists,
the more extreme the better.

29:47.813 --> 29:48.979
Garcia?

29:51.117 --> 29:56.153
I will send Agent Alvez that list now.

29:56.155 --> 29:57.488
Good-bye.

30:05.731 --> 30:07.566
Did you turn off the GPS?

30:16.676 --> 30:17.808
Very good.

30:18.730 --> 30:20.597
Come in.

30:53.207 --> 30:54.306
Hey.

31:05.598 --> 31:07.465
How can I help?

31:07.467 --> 31:11.430
Brian's parents are gonna
be here in a few minutes.

31:13.239 --> 31:16.208
Can you sit in on the
interview and just...

31:16.385 --> 31:18.252
Make sure I don't miss anything?

31:18.516 --> 31:20.315
I will.

31:20.317 --> 31:21.984
And you won't.

31:23.654 --> 31:27.156
Now listen to me very closely.

31:28.826 --> 31:32.261
Brian was always a sensitive child.

31:32.263 --> 31:35.230
We did our best.

31:35.232 --> 31:37.199
Can you keep him from hurting himself?

31:37.201 --> 31:38.801
Or anyone else?

31:38.803 --> 31:40.169
Uh, we're going to try,

31:40.171 --> 31:43.305
but he's wanted for the murder
of a police officer.

31:45.109 --> 31:47.509
What do you need from us, Agents?

31:47.511 --> 31:50.312
We need to ask you about Brian's D.I.D.

31:50.314 --> 31:51.914
And where it started.

31:51.916 --> 31:54.983
We adopted Brian, through our church.

31:54.985 --> 31:57.119
It was a closed adoption.

31:57.121 --> 32:02.124
When we received him,
he had these... scars.

32:02.935 --> 32:06.303
The pediatrician told us that somebody
in the foster care system

32:06.305 --> 32:09.073
had smashed bottles across him

32:09.075 --> 32:11.075
and then cut him with the jagged glass.

32:11.454 --> 32:12.754
Was he ever violent?

32:12.796 --> 32:15.430
Only toward himself. He would...

32:15.832 --> 32:17.399
Cut open his own scars.

32:18.452 --> 32:21.920
And then he would, uh,
go into like a chant.

32:21.922 --> 32:22.688
Like a mantra.

32:22.700 --> 32:25.200
We thought he was
self-soothing at first.

32:25.295 --> 32:28.463
And then we realized that
he was talking like...

32:28.465 --> 32:30.867
Girls, right?

32:31.769 --> 32:33.368
Who were they?

32:33.370 --> 32:36.171
Well, we think that they were
in the foster care with him,

32:36.173 --> 32:38.507
that they would help him,
you know, feel better

32:38.509 --> 32:40.575
after he'd been hurt.

32:40.577 --> 32:42.811
Ok, this is very important.

32:42.813 --> 32:45.881
What would he say when
he talked like them?

32:47.418 --> 32:50.419
Uh, yeah. This guy

32:50.421 --> 32:52.654
ordered this arm spreader.

32:52.656 --> 32:55.124
Um, two of them, actually.

32:55.426 --> 32:57.359
Two of them?

32:57.361 --> 32:59.061
So where's the other one?

32:59.063 --> 33:01.263
Um... Could I see your badge again?

33:01.265 --> 33:03.365
Yeah. Is there a problem?

33:03.367 --> 33:05.467
Um...

33:05.469 --> 33:07.335
Yeah, ok, the guy who ordered them,

33:07.337 --> 33:11.139
the name he left on the invoice
was Dr. Spencer Reid.

33:11.141 --> 33:12.941
Did he pay with my credit card also?

33:12.943 --> 33:14.910
Cash.
I knew he was sketchy.

33:14.912 --> 33:17.145
Guys like him give S&M a bad rap.

33:17.147 --> 33:20.348
Which is why I did ask for a copy
of Dr. Reid's driver's license,

33:20.350 --> 33:22.751
which he gave me happily.

33:22.753 --> 33:25.020
We'll need to see that right now.

33:25.022 --> 33:27.322
Oh, uh...

33:27.324 --> 33:29.591
He was all up in your
business, boy wonder.

33:29.593 --> 33:31.660
He used your social security number

33:31.662 --> 33:34.596
to do a change of address
and everything,

33:34.598 --> 33:37.265
but, speaking of addresses,
we have a local one for him.

33:37.267 --> 33:40.702
Good. Get that information to the rest
of the team and the police, please.

33:40.704 --> 33:42.104
We need to assume he has the same level

33:42.106 --> 33:43.672
of personal information
for the entire BAU.

33:43.674 --> 33:44.973
And Daniel Cullen.

33:44.975 --> 33:46.541
But we ruled out his involvement.

33:46.543 --> 33:48.043
Now I'm not so sure.

33:48.045 --> 33:51.580
Peter Lewis copied a specific detail
of Cullen's arm spreader,

33:51.582 --> 33:53.215
one that wasn't in a public record.

33:53.217 --> 33:54.683
The only way he could have gotten it

33:54.685 --> 33:57.853
is if the real Crimson King
has been a part of this all along.

33:59.756 --> 34:01.623
I have to go.

34:01.925 --> 34:04.726
But I'm leaving you with a gift.

34:11.435 --> 34:12.701
Who is he?

34:12.703 --> 34:14.803
His name is Daniel Cullen.

34:14.804 --> 34:17.072
He thinks he's the Crimson King.

34:19.243 --> 34:21.009
What will you do about that?

34:31.014 --> 34:33.850
Reid, Luke, the police
are 10 minutes out.

34:33.851 --> 34:35.952
That could be a problem.
If the police try to convince Brian

34:35.954 --> 34:37.620
he's not the Crimson King,
he could get unstable.

34:37.621 --> 34:39.655
Guys, we might have a solution.

34:39.657 --> 34:42.024
Try to keep Brian calm.
We're on our way.

35:05.550 --> 35:07.750
FBI! Drop the weapon!

35:07.752 --> 35:10.219
No. No.

35:10.221 --> 35:11.387
Help me.

35:11.389 --> 35:13.356
The Crimson King doesn't kill.

35:13.358 --> 35:15.391
He doesn't have to. Remember?

35:15.393 --> 35:16.592
That's right.

35:20.164 --> 35:21.831
You kill and it's over.

35:21.833 --> 35:25.067
But if you let him go, he has
to live the rest of his life

35:25.069 --> 35:27.236
as a failure.
Isn't that what you really want?

35:27.238 --> 35:29.472
No. That's not good enough.

35:32.543 --> 35:38.381
No one is gonna hurt
you like that ever again.

35:38.383 --> 35:40.182
Back off! I mean it!

35:40.184 --> 35:42.118
We can't do that.

35:42.120 --> 35:44.820
Ok? Someone told you to do this.

35:44.822 --> 35:48.624
But this isn't who you are, is it?

35:48.626 --> 35:50.126
We know that.

35:50.128 --> 35:53.930
No one is going to hurt
you like that ever again.

35:53.932 --> 35:55.765
Nobody hurt me, I hurt them.

35:55.767 --> 35:58.034
Yes, they did hurt you.

35:58.036 --> 36:01.938
They cut you when you were little.

36:02.340 --> 36:04.407
And then right here on this very table,

36:04.409 --> 36:07.043
you saw your own blood and
you didn't know what to do,

36:07.045 --> 36:10.080
so you became the Crimson King
to protect yourself.

36:10.426 --> 36:13.760
No one is gonna hurt
you like that ever again.

36:13.762 --> 36:17.364
No one is gonna hurt
you like that ever again.

36:20.668 --> 36:23.236
Do you remember Eliza?

36:24.138 --> 36:26.739
Angelica?

36:26.741 --> 36:30.309
What they used to say
to you at the foster home

36:30.311 --> 36:32.778
to calm you down?

36:32.780 --> 36:39.285
No one is going to hurt you
like that ever again.

36:46.928 --> 36:49.095
Do you promise?

36:49.097 --> 36:53.532
Yeah. I promise.

36:54.916 --> 36:57.971
Brian, this is for
your own protection, ok?

36:58.221 --> 37:02.090
We're taking you into custody,
for your safety.

37:04.633 --> 37:05.632
Tara?

37:05.634 --> 37:07.233
Yeah?

37:08.187 --> 37:10.704
Oh, my God, what did I do?

37:11.306 --> 37:14.307
I'm going to be with you
every step of the way.

37:14.309 --> 37:17.043
All right? I'm not leaving your side.

37:56.785 --> 37:59.753
I'm gonna ride with him downtown.

38:00.455 --> 38:02.288
Ok.

38:02.290 --> 38:05.392
Hey. Good job.

38:34.956 --> 38:37.804
Thank you, both of you.

38:37.831 --> 38:39.959
No, don't thank us.

38:39.961 --> 38:42.729
You're under arrest.

38:42.731 --> 38:46.499
Ok. Uh, for what? What did I do?

38:46.501 --> 38:48.401
Must have dosed him to
make him lose his memory

38:48.403 --> 38:49.803
so we couldn't get
any answers out of him.

38:49.838 --> 38:52.071
No, we've met. 3 years ago.

38:52.146 --> 38:54.615
Hmm? What's my name?

38:55.717 --> 38:56.983
What's my partner's name?

38:56.985 --> 38:58.551
I don't know.

38:58.553 --> 38:59.518
You're faking it.

38:59.520 --> 39:00.420
Luke.

39:00.422 --> 39:03.656
You're faking it. What's your name?

39:03.958 --> 39:05.625
What's your name? Say it.

39:05.627 --> 39:07.360
I don't know.

39:07.362 --> 39:09.896
Tell me. Please.

39:25.113 --> 39:26.913
It might not be permanent, right?

39:26.915 --> 39:28.981
He might get his memories back.

39:28.983 --> 39:30.750
He might.

39:34.489 --> 39:37.290
I've obsessed about this for so long.

39:37.292 --> 39:39.258
But now, the way it went down,

39:39.260 --> 39:42.194
I just feel...

39:42.196 --> 39:44.096
You know.

39:45.620 --> 39:48.389
I try not to think about
the ones I'm going to catch.

39:48.454 --> 39:50.221
I prefer the think about
the ones I'm going to save.

39:50.523 --> 39:52.390
You don't want to catch Peter Lewis?

39:52.392 --> 39:54.191
Of course I do.

39:56.262 --> 39:58.329
Brian was just a test case.

39:58.331 --> 39:59.630
He'll do this again.

39:59.632 --> 40:01.310
We have the same list.
We're contacting everybody on it.

40:01.401 --> 40:04.570
But you're right.
He will try to do this again.

40:06.272 --> 40:08.072
If you want to help catch him...

40:12.678 --> 40:14.478
Yeah, I would.

40:14.480 --> 40:16.814
Given his resources and
the depth of his planning,

40:16.816 --> 40:18.449
we need you full-time.
It's a commitment.

40:18.451 --> 40:20.217
You'll have to take a
full profiling load, too.

40:20.219 --> 40:21.218
To 500 hours?

40:21.220 --> 40:22.720
560.

40:26.659 --> 40:28.125
Let's do it.

40:29.295 --> 40:30.895
Welcome to the team.

40:30.897 --> 40:32.997
Thanks.

40:42.475 --> 40:44.575
I will take the stairs.

40:44.577 --> 40:46.077
No, no, no, no, you won't.

40:46.079 --> 40:47.812
Because you're gonna
have to get used to me.

40:47.814 --> 40:50.648
All right? I'm now SSA Luke Alvez

40:50.650 --> 40:53.250
with the Behavioral Analysis Unit.

40:53.252 --> 40:54.385
No way.

40:54.387 --> 40:56.420
Ok, SSA in training.

40:56.422 --> 40:58.589
But you're still gonna
have to figure out

40:58.591 --> 41:01.092
how to be nice to me.

41:01.094 --> 41:02.593
I am nice.

41:02.595 --> 41:05.229
I am like the Queen of Nice.

41:05.231 --> 41:08.566
Maybe like the Queen of Ice.

41:08.568 --> 41:12.069
Ok. Ok. Look.

41:12.071 --> 41:14.138
This is my nice face.

41:14.140 --> 41:16.640
Ha... Ha.

41:16.642 --> 41:19.777
I gave you that.

41:22.515 --> 41:24.215
So, Garcia...

41:24.217 --> 41:26.250
Yeah, what about it?

41:26.252 --> 41:28.018
I don't know, is that
from the little known

41:28.020 --> 41:30.287
blond-haired Swedish Garcias?

41:30.289 --> 41:34.091
Actually it's from the family that
took me in after my parents died.

41:34.093 --> 41:37.928
So, thanks for reminding me
of that painful memory.

41:37.930 --> 41:40.331
So what are you doing
tonight, chica, huh?

41:40.333 --> 41:43.067
Hang out with your Canadian boyfriend
that totally exists?

41:43.069 --> 41:45.336
Ok, he does totally exist.

41:45.338 --> 41:48.739
And he's not Canadian.
And why does it matter what we're doing?

41:48.741 --> 41:51.809
What are you doing,
Mr. Tall, dark, and blandsome?

41:51.811 --> 41:54.245
Just kickin' it with Roxy.

41:54.247 --> 41:55.646
Huh. Who's that?

41:55.648 --> 41:57.114
That's my girl.

41:57.116 --> 41:59.116
Yeah, you should meet her sometime.

41:59.118 --> 42:00.184
You'd love her.

42:00.186 --> 42:01.352
Yeah.

42:04.490 --> 42:06.490
Does she love you?

42:06.492 --> 42:08.792
Yeah, she adores me.

42:08.794 --> 42:12.062
Tell her to call me when
she's come to her senses.

42:27.146 --> 42:31.582
"The evil
that men do lives after them.

42:31.584 --> 42:35.085
The good is oft interred
with their bones."

42:35.087 --> 42:36.854
William Shakespeare.

42:40.725 --> 42:42.291
There you are.
