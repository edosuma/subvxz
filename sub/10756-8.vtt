WEBVTT

00:10.010 --> 00:11.284
Look, we had an agreement.

00:11.450 --> 00:14.442
We went to a movie I wanted to see,
so I was supposed to pay for the ticket.

00:14.610 --> 00:17.647
Very well, Dad. The next time we go
to a Jean-Claude Van Damme movie,

00:17.850 --> 00:19.488
not only may you pay for the tickets,

00:19.650 --> 00:23.802
but also for the wild horses
it will take to drag me there.

00:23.970 --> 00:26.086
Well, I'm only mad because
we had an agreement.

00:26.250 --> 00:28.366
Now, a man's supposed to honour
his agreements.

00:28.530 --> 00:30.122
Didn't you learn anything
from that movie?

00:30.290 --> 00:31.928
Only that bullets are useless
against a man

00:32.090 --> 00:34.001
who can kick really high.

00:35.410 --> 00:39.039
Now, look, I'm serious about this.
Once in a while, I'd like to pay.

00:39.250 --> 00:40.239
- Okay.
- MARTIN: Okay.

00:40.410 --> 00:42.970
So the next time we go anywhere,
it's on me. Have I made my point?

00:43.170 --> 00:45.559
Yes, Dad, with all the subtlety
that Mr Van Damme displayed

00:45.730 --> 00:49.848
when he jet-packed into the Vatican to
subdue that nasty old pope impostor.

00:50.050 --> 00:52.041
Like you saw that coming.

00:53.410 --> 00:55.878
Well, Maris has finally deigned
to call me back,

00:56.050 --> 00:57.642
after I've left no fewer than
20 messages.

00:57.810 --> 01:01.200
Honestly, Niles, by calling her so many
times, you give her all the power.

01:01.370 --> 01:03.725
You're much better off coming
from a position of strength.

01:03.890 --> 01:06.245
Don't pour that sherry on your shirt.
It will stain.

01:07.170 --> 01:08.319
- What?
- I'm sorry.

01:08.490 --> 01:10.287
I thought this was
the portion of the afternoon

01:10.450 --> 01:12.361
where we gave each
other patently obvious advice.

01:13.050 --> 01:16.645
I had to call Maris for that party I'm
throwing for my country club friends.

01:16.810 --> 01:19.529
Oh, yes, the one I wasn't invited to
but my Waterford punchbowl was.

01:19.690 --> 01:23.569
Yes, well, Maris has chosen the same
night to throw a party of her own.

01:23.770 --> 01:25.761
- Couldn't you ask her to postpone?
- I tried.

01:25.970 --> 01:29.519
She's already flown in a sculptor from
Sweden to capture her likeness in ice.

01:29.810 --> 01:33.849
Ah, the perfect marriage
of subject and medium.

01:34.890 --> 01:36.801
Well, you can see my problem.

01:36.970 --> 01:39.768
We're going to be competing now
for which friends go to which party.

01:39.930 --> 01:43.206
You know, Niles, for a separated
couple still hoping to reconcile,

01:43.370 --> 01:45.088
I'm afraid you're going down
a path that...

01:45.290 --> 01:47.724
You shouldn't wear that tie
with that jacket.

01:48.810 --> 01:52.359
Oh, is that your clever way of telling
me I'm dispensing unwanted criticism?

01:52.570 --> 01:53.639
That too.

01:56.010 --> 01:57.682
- Hello, boys.
- Hello, Daphne.

01:57.850 --> 02:00.569
Oh, Dr Crane. Will you be
joining us for dinner?

02:00.730 --> 02:04.689
- What a nice invitation. I'd love to.
- Well, then, you're in for a treat.

02:04.890 --> 02:08.086
I've decided to make Grammy Moon's
famous sheep's head stew.

02:08.610 --> 02:10.840
Oh, don't worry,
the name's a bit misleading.

02:11.050 --> 02:13.120
It's actually more of a soup.

02:15.410 --> 02:17.287
You actually use a real sheep's head?

02:17.490 --> 02:21.563
- Oh, you have to. It's right in here.
- Oh, my God! I just remembered,

02:21.730 --> 02:23.448
we have reservations
at Le Cigare Volant!

02:23.650 --> 02:27.245
- Oh, my God, you're right!
- Gee, is that tonight? I nearly forgot.

02:27.450 --> 02:29.759
- You're going too, Mr Crane?
- Well, I promised the boys.

02:29.930 --> 02:32.763
I don't suppose there's any way
you guys would let me out of this.

02:32.930 --> 02:34.329
- Well...
- You promised.

02:34.530 --> 02:36.407
MARTIN:
See, I tried.

02:36.570 --> 02:39.403
Well, have fun.
I'm off to stick my head in the oven.

Yeah, I got rid of them.

You see, we have no reservations.

03:22.970 --> 03:26.087
- Dr Crane, I will see what I can do.
- Thank you.

03:26.250 --> 03:27.888
Anything would be just fine.
Thank you.

03:28.090 --> 03:29.284
You know, come to think of it,

03:29.450 --> 03:33.125
we haven't been here since Chef
Joachim had his pinkie grafted back on.

03:33.330 --> 03:36.845
Oh, then this is your first time
seeing our new artwork.

03:37.370 --> 03:38.849
He's my own discovery.

03:39.050 --> 03:40.563
His name is Cordoba.

03:40.850 --> 03:42.806
- Exquisite!
- Stunning!

My God, I don't think I've ever seen
such fearless use of colour.

03:47.290 --> 03:52.000
You know, as usual, your taste
is as fine as your cuisine. Any luck?

03:52.210 --> 03:56.328

My God, he ought
to bring us blindfolds.

04:17.370 --> 04:20.327
I mean, what is he thinking
with this artwork?

04:20.490 --> 04:21.524
It's appalling.

04:21.730 --> 04:23.368
Who was it that said,
"Art in restaurants

04:23.530 --> 04:25.600
is on the same level with food
in museums"?

04:26.810 --> 04:29.608
The little white lies one will tell
for a good table, huh?

04:29.930 --> 04:32.239
Of course, I would compliment
a black velvet Elvis right now

were at stake.

04:37.010 --> 04:38.966

She's one of the guests Maris and I
are competing over.

04:41.770 --> 04:42.885
I'm going to go woo her.

04:43.050 --> 04:45.803
Oh, really, Niles, why don't you
just reschedule your party?

04:46.010 --> 04:48.968
I don't want to give her the satisfaction.
She's pushed me around long enough.

04:49.170 --> 04:50.398
- All right.
- Metaphorically.

04:50.610 --> 04:53.044
In reality, she can hardly push at all.

04:53.210 --> 04:55.724
Hence, that terrible afternoon
last spring she spent trapped

04:55.890 --> 04:57.562
in the revolving door at Bergdorf's.

04:59.730 --> 05:03.086
I hope there's something on there you
like because dinner's on me tonight.

- We had an agreement.

05:05.130 --> 05:08.167
- Next time we went out, it's my treat.
- Well, Dad, when I said that...

05:08.370 --> 05:10.725
- Hup, We're not discussing it.
- Yes, but Dad, it's rather pricey.

05:10.890 --> 05:12.721
- Hup, you promised.
- Well, l... I just don't...

I'm not stupid.

- What are you talking about?
- Eating light?

that Eddie gets

when he hears a can-opener.

05:53.890 --> 05:56.358
Look, Dad, it's just that I'm not
that comfortable ordering

05:56.530 --> 05:58.327
an expensive meal
when you're paying.

05:58.530 --> 06:00.839

You take me to places like this.

it sounded.

- I know how you feel.
- No, you don't.

has agreed to come to my party.

- Actually, tonight's dinner is on Dad.
- No, you ruined it. I'm not paying.

- Well, I'm not paying!
- Well, I can't pay.

10:22.250 --> 10:23.365
Say, Roz,

10:23.570 --> 10:26.368
if you're not busy, would you like
to get a drink or something?

10:26.570 --> 10:28.288
You know, maybe see a movie?

10:28.490 --> 10:29.639
You pick, I'll pay.

10:30.370 --> 10:33.487
You can stay out as late as you want,
but eventually you have to go home,

10:33.650 --> 10:35.925
and that painting will still be there.

10:37.690 --> 10:39.999
- You have to tell him.
- I can't, Roz.

10:40.170 --> 10:42.400
You didn't see the look on his face
when he gave it to me.

10:42.570 --> 10:45.164
Frasier, have I ever told you about
my ceramic hippo collection?

10:45.370 --> 10:47.759
- Oh, yes. Many times.
- The hell I have. Shut up and listen.

10:48.810 --> 10:51.927
One Christmas my grandma
sent me a ceramic hippo.

10:52.090 --> 10:54.320
Roz, a hippo cannot possibly
be as repellent

10:54.490 --> 10:57.766
as a rabid matador killing
an epileptic bull.

10:58.130 --> 11:01.088
Was the bull wearing a porkpie hat
and fishing off a dock?

11:02.490 --> 11:04.162
- Continue.
- Okay.

11:04.370 --> 11:06.679
I made the mistake of telling her
how much I loved it.

11:06.850 --> 11:08.363
Well, that just opened the floodgates.

11:08.570 --> 11:11.164
I got ice-skating hippos
and hula-hooping hippos.

11:11.330 --> 11:13.400
Thank God for that earthquake!

11:15.290 --> 11:16.769
Oh, you mean, you mean they broke?

11:16.970 --> 11:20.326
Well, I assume they did when they hit
the bottom of the garbage chute.

11:21.050 --> 11:22.927
But I blamed it on the earthquake.

11:23.130 --> 11:26.918
The point is you need to talk to your
father now and be honest with him.

11:27.090 --> 11:29.320
Or you'll be stuck with it
till the next natural disaster.

11:29.530 --> 11:31.760
Hell, you're right, Roz.

11:31.930 --> 11:34.603
I guess I'll just have to tell him
this afternoon.

11:34.770 --> 11:35.759
Good.

11:35.930 --> 11:40.003
Oh, Roz, that crystal vase I gave you
three years ago for Christmas,

11:40.170 --> 11:42.047
you said that was broken
in the earthquake.

11:42.250 --> 11:45.481
Oh, no, no, no, that really was.
I was very disappointed.

11:45.690 --> 11:46.884
As disappointed as you were

11:47.050 --> 11:49.769
when Eddie chewed up that sweater
I gave you for Christmas.

11:51.570 --> 11:53.959
- This year, liquor?
- Deal.

12:00.010 --> 12:02.319
- Oh, hi, Dad.
- Hey, Fras.

12:04.170 --> 12:05.922
You know, I was just down
in the storage room

12:06.090 --> 12:07.489
putting away some boxes.

12:07.890 --> 12:10.006
Guess what I came across.

12:10.210 --> 12:13.998
That... That smoking jacket I gave you
for Christmas last year.

12:14.210 --> 12:17.043
- The shiny one?
- Not shiny, Dad, silk.

12:18.810 --> 12:21.244
I really... I really missed the boat
on that one, didn't I?

12:21.410 --> 12:23.446
You know, it's just, buying things
for other people,

12:23.610 --> 12:25.760
- it's so hard sometimes, isn't it?
- Yeah.

12:25.970 --> 12:28.484
Hey, you want some pastrami?
There's some more in the fridge.

12:28.690 --> 12:30.726
No, thanks, Dad.
I don't really care for pastrami.

12:30.890 --> 12:33.643
Isn't that funny, you know,
you can love something so much,

12:33.810 --> 12:36.370
and I would find it distasteful.

12:36.970 --> 12:38.688
- People have different tastes.
- Yeah.

12:38.850 --> 12:39.999
[DOORBELL RINGS]

12:40.170 --> 12:43.367
Well, that's one way of looking at it.
Some people like pastrami, like me,

12:43.530 --> 12:45.088
other people don't. They're nuts.

12:48.010 --> 12:49.045
- Afternoon.
- Hey, Niles.

12:49.250 --> 12:50.842
- Hi, Niles.
- Dad, Frasier,

12:51.050 --> 12:53.280
I'm here to pick up the punchbowl
for my party.

12:53.450 --> 12:56.408
Although at this point,
a soup bowl might suffice.

13:01.170 --> 13:03.479
Thanks to Maris, I'm down to three
confirmed guests.

13:03.650 --> 13:05.641
Three? Yesterday it was 12, wasn't it?

13:05.850 --> 13:09.968
She's circulating a vicious rumour that
I'm going to have a karaoke machine.

13:10.850 --> 13:14.889
You know, this vindictive behaviour
of Maris' is completely out of line.

13:15.090 --> 13:17.160
If you don't want her
to continue with it, you should

13:17.370 --> 13:19.645
call her on the phone
and confront her.

13:20.850 --> 13:22.806
You're absolutely right.

13:22.970 --> 13:25.484
It's time I took the bull by the horns.

13:28.650 --> 13:29.969
Sorry.

13:30.490 --> 13:32.367
Maris? Niles.

13:32.570 --> 13:34.162
You may feel you've triumphed,

13:34.330 --> 13:38.243
but all you've done is shown yourself
to be petty and uncivil.

13:38.450 --> 13:41.203
Frankly, the only people
lower than you

13:41.410 --> 13:45.005
are the fickle paramecia that deserted
my party to attend yours.

13:45.530 --> 13:46.565
Uh-huh.

13:46.730 --> 13:49.403
Oh, I see. Very well. Yes.

13:49.570 --> 13:52.243
I'll see you at 8.
Can I bring anything?

13:57.290 --> 13:59.121
Thank God
for the starch in that shirt,

13:59.290 --> 14:01.360
or there'd be nothing
holding you upright.

14:04.450 --> 14:06.839
Hey, Niles. Here.

14:08.730 --> 14:10.925
- Well, what's that?
- It's a wine rack.

14:11.090 --> 14:12.842
- Really?
- Yeah.

14:13.010 --> 14:15.763
I felt kind of bad about giving Frasier
something and nothing for you,

14:15.930 --> 14:17.886
so I saw it at Price Busters.

14:20.010 --> 14:21.682
Well, thank you for
the thought, Dad,

14:21.850 --> 14:24.648
but it doesn't really fit in
with the decor of my apartment.

14:24.810 --> 14:26.323
Oh. Oh, okay.

14:26.490 --> 14:28.640
Well, no harm done.
I'll take it back.

14:28.810 --> 14:30.641
- Anybody want a beer?
- No, thanks.

14:30.810 --> 14:32.562
No, thanks, Dad.

14:34.090 --> 14:35.921
Frasier, I no longer require
your punchbowl,

14:36.090 --> 14:37.569
but may I borrow your blow dryer?

14:37.770 --> 14:38.919
Of course. Why?

14:39.090 --> 14:43.606
Sven finished Maris' ice sculpture, and
she's convinced she looks a bit hippy.

14:46.250 --> 14:47.478
Dad?

14:47.650 --> 14:50.767
Are you sure Niles didn't
just hurt your feelings now?

14:50.970 --> 14:54.406
No. I'm glad he told me. I don't wanna
give him something he doesn't like.

14:54.850 --> 14:56.841
That's very wise.

14:57.010 --> 14:59.922
You know, it's important for fathers
and sons to be honest with each other.

15:00.090 --> 15:01.443
It shows respect.

15:02.570 --> 15:05.209
You know, I've been thinking, Dad,
about the painting.

15:05.410 --> 15:07.844
You know, art,
it's such a personal thing.

15:08.010 --> 15:09.602
What one person may like,
another may not.

15:09.770 --> 15:12.159
It doesn't mean that one is right
and the other is wrong.

15:12.330 --> 15:14.241
You telling me
you don't like the painting?

15:14.410 --> 15:17.288
Well, it's not that I don't like it,
it's just I don't love it.

15:17.450 --> 15:18.644
It's not me.

15:19.770 --> 15:21.761
Not a problem. You don't like it,
I'll take it back.

15:21.930 --> 15:24.046
Oh, thank God, Dad, thank you.
That's such a relief.

15:24.210 --> 15:27.566
You know, I was up half the night
worried about it, and I just...

15:29.010 --> 15:30.238
Dad, are you all right?

15:31.010 --> 15:33.126
Well, I didn't upset you, did I?

15:34.290 --> 15:35.609
My God, Dad, are you crying?

15:35.810 --> 15:36.959
No, no.

15:37.490 --> 15:39.720
Yes, you are! Yes, you are!
I just saw you wipe your eyes.

No, I didn't. I just...
Quit looking at me!

Oh, my God!

15:46.770 --> 15:49.648
- I've made my father cry.
- Now, don't you start!

15:49.850 --> 15:52.125
Oh, God, I'm only crying
because you're crying.

15:52.330 --> 15:54.525
I'm not crying!
I don't know what this is.

15:54.690 --> 15:56.965
I didn't even cry when I got shot.

15:57.450 --> 16:00.328
I didn't cry when you got shot, either.

16:01.490 --> 16:04.050
I'm getting rid of that damn
painting right now.

16:04.210 --> 16:07.168

the waiter you loved it so much.

- I was lying to him!
- Oh, you can lie to him,

16:09.410 --> 16:13.528
- but you can't lie to me?!
- Please, please stop crying.

16:13.690 --> 16:16.602
- I wanna keep it now.
- No, it's no good.

Nothing happened this afternoon.

17:11.530 --> 17:13.281
Look, Dad,

17:13.450 --> 17:15.520
I know you're disappointed
about the painting.

17:15.690 --> 17:16.679
It's not a problem.

17:16.849 --> 17:19.204
Well, look, you said yourself
that it wasn't as easy for you

17:19.369 --> 17:21.326
to give me things as it was
when I was a kid.

17:21.890 --> 17:23.482
I wasn't very good at it then either.

17:23.650 --> 17:26.005
Your mother always picked
all your stuff out.

You wanna talk about this?

We'll talk about it.

I don't know,

something you liked,
something we both liked.

18:02.210 --> 18:04.929

You were getting ready for work,

and you were getting dressed,
and I was playing with your badge?

18:26.890 --> 18:30.166
And you sat me down and you said
that it was not a toy.

18:31.410 --> 18:34.880

you put on that badge, I would,

I would think of that.

as to the proper course of action,
