WEBVTT

00:00.303 --> 00:02.137
Previously on "Heartland"...

00:02.218 --> 00:04.652
No, please do send me
that report.

00:04.654 --> 00:06.487
Thank you. Ugh!

00:06.489 --> 00:08.756
- What?
- That was the insurance company.

00:08.758 --> 00:10.425
They got Carson's report

00:10.427 --> 00:12.493
and the loft failed
his inspection.

00:12.850 --> 00:13.681
What?

00:13.693 --> 00:17.632
Put your hands together
for Hudson's very own Extreme Team!

00:17.634 --> 00:21.402
We're going to start
things off with their youngest rider.

00:21.404 --> 00:25.440
Introducing
Georgina Fleming Morris.

00:31.213 --> 00:33.181
- She did it!
- Ahh!

00:35.000 --> 00:41.074

01:18.061 --> 01:19.494
Whew!

01:21.497 --> 01:24.432
Come on, Phoenix, keep up!

01:24.434 --> 01:27.201
Good boy!

01:27.203 --> 01:28.736
Good boy, Trouble.

01:33.208 --> 01:35.977
Eyes up!
You look where you wanna go!

01:35.979 --> 01:39.580
- Easy, easy.
- Oh, come on, keep your reins steady!

01:39.582 --> 01:41.516
Steady!

01:43.986 --> 01:46.287
Okay, find your core!

01:47.280 --> 01:49.390
That's it. When you're
centered, they're centered.

01:49.392 --> 01:51.993
See how they're heads
are up now?

02:01.271 --> 02:04.305
- Whoa...
- Nice!

02:04.307 --> 02:06.341
That was amazing!

02:06.343 --> 02:09.110
Thank you so much
for coming over, Sam.

02:09.112 --> 02:10.610
Hey, we're on the same team, right?

02:10.613 --> 02:12.613
I'm happy to help.

02:12.615 --> 02:15.616
I'm always so impressed by how
you handle your horses in class.

02:15.618 --> 02:18.252
I just... really need some
extra advice.

02:18.254 --> 02:20.421
Look, it's not a problem.
Anytime.

02:20.423 --> 02:22.690
You're gonna be a real threat
someday, little girl.

02:22.692 --> 02:25.393
Just don't come looking to steal
my headliner status, okay?

02:25.395 --> 02:27.795
Yeah, like that'll happen.

02:27.797 --> 02:31.065
Oh! Hey, Claire. What's up?

02:31.067 --> 02:34.469
Are you kidding me?
That's awesome!

02:34.471 --> 02:38.573
I'm at Georgie's place.
You know, Georgie.

02:38.575 --> 02:43.344
The new kid. Yeah, okay.
Okay, I'll call you later.

02:43.346 --> 02:45.313
That was Claire.
You know Claire?

02:45.315 --> 02:48.316
She finally got permission to borrow
her dad's camper for the weekend.

02:48.318 --> 02:50.952
- Oh cool.
- Yeah, so road trip!

02:50.954 --> 02:52.387
Me and Claire and some of
the other girls on the team

02:52.389 --> 02:53.855
are hitting the road to Jasper.

02:53.857 --> 02:55.156
It's gonna be epic.

02:56.993 --> 03:00.128
Hey, you know what?
How about...?

03:00.130 --> 03:02.530
Oh, shoot! I was supposed to meet my
boyfriend in town 15 minutes ago.

03:02.532 --> 03:05.266
Look, I'm so sorry. I gotta go.

03:06.636 --> 03:09.036
- See you later, kiddo.
- See ya.

03:15.010 --> 03:17.578
Kiddo? Really?

03:17.580 --> 03:20.114
Hey, Georgie!

03:20.116 --> 03:22.116
- Is Amy around?
- Uh, I don't know.

03:22.118 --> 03:25.353
I think she might be in the office.

03:26.955 --> 03:28.589
What's in the cage?

03:28.591 --> 03:30.258
Don't ask.

03:37.167 --> 03:41.135
Oh, they're so cute!
Hi, little guy! Hello.

03:41.137 --> 03:45.139
I don't understand how anyone would
think that possums make good pets.

03:45.141 --> 03:47.875
Well, it's pretty clear they learned
the hard way that they don't.

03:47.877 --> 03:49.410
They were so desperate
to get rid of them,

03:49.412 --> 03:52.447
they just dropped them
on Bob's front step and ran.

03:52.449 --> 03:54.115
Isn't there space for them
at the reserve?

03:54.117 --> 03:55.683
None that really work.

03:55.685 --> 03:59.253
- Well, can we keep 'em?
- No, we can't them, Georgie.

03:59.255 --> 04:01.122
They're not pets,
they're wild animals.

04:01.124 --> 04:03.090
So are you gonna let them go, then?

04:03.092 --> 04:05.426
I can't. They're not
indigenous to Alberta.

04:05.474 --> 04:06.767
Indigenous?

04:06.820 --> 04:09.030
It means they can't survive
in this climate.

04:09.032 --> 04:11.466
So... what's your plan?

04:11.468 --> 04:14.035
Well, I'm gonna phone
Fish and Wildlife

04:14.037 --> 04:16.003
and let them deal with it.

04:16.005 --> 04:19.574
In the meantime though, we're gonna need
to find a nice dark place for these guys

04:19.576 --> 04:21.242
'cause the more stressed out
they get...

04:21.244 --> 04:24.111
The more they stink.

04:24.113 --> 04:27.114
You're pretty cute,
but you guys reek.

04:27.116 --> 04:30.551
Aw... Come here. Hey, Georgie,
don't put your finger in there.

04:30.553 --> 04:32.053
They got more teeth
than a piranha.

04:32.055 --> 04:33.654
They'll bite you.

04:33.656 --> 04:37.291
I'm gonna name you guys
Stinky and Minky.

04:37.293 --> 04:41.095
Whew! God, what are those? Pew!

04:41.097 --> 04:44.899
Uh, no. Don't even ask.

04:44.901 --> 04:47.235
How 'bout a picnic lunch
with me and Katie?

04:47.237 --> 04:48.970
I have a pretty cool surprise for you.

04:50.640 --> 04:53.908
So you know how I did my
taxes myself this year?

04:53.910 --> 04:56.177
Ran the numbers better
than any accountant could...

04:56.179 --> 04:57.612
all legal of course.

04:57.614 --> 05:00.448
Anyways, it turns out
there is a big tax refund

05:00.450 --> 05:02.517
Mommy hoped she would get.

05:02.519 --> 05:05.086
Tax refunds are actually
pretty cool.

05:05.088 --> 05:08.589
Long story short, I got it...
the tax refund...

05:08.591 --> 05:10.424
an unexpected little windfall...

05:10.426 --> 05:14.028
so... I've decided we all
deserve a break.

05:14.030 --> 05:15.496
So we are going on a vacation

05:15.498 --> 05:18.266
to a place called the Dominican
Republic

05:18.268 --> 05:21.002
just the three of us!
It'll be a girls' week!

05:21.004 --> 05:23.504
What's the Domino Republic?

05:23.506 --> 05:27.775
It is a beautiful island
with lots of beaches

05:27.777 --> 05:30.344
and tons of fun stuff to do.

05:30.346 --> 05:32.146
We're even gonna stay
in a nice hotel.

05:32.148 --> 05:33.648
You wanna see?

05:33.650 --> 05:35.583
- We can go scuba diving and...
- Mmhmm. Mm-hmm.

05:35.585 --> 05:40.154
And we can practice
our Spanish, right?

05:40.156 --> 05:42.990
Are you happy?

05:42.992 --> 05:46.160
I'm really glad you're happy,
'cause this is gonna be the best!

05:46.162 --> 05:48.296
Yeah! It really is!

05:48.298 --> 05:50.798
And ooh, see the pool?
I can teach you to swim.

05:50.800 --> 05:52.233
See the pool, Georgie?

05:52.235 --> 05:54.535
We can go out on a boat.
Oh, oh, look.

05:54.537 --> 05:56.470
There's a sunset ride
on the beach you can do.

05:56.472 --> 06:00.174
Cool, hey? Do you wanna go ride
a horse on the beach?

06:00.606 --> 06:04.049
S09E09
A Matter of Trust

06:04.208 --> 06:07.730
sync and corrected by ninh
www.addic7ed.com

06:43.218 --> 06:46.253
- Okay, guys.
- How about right under here?

06:46.255 --> 06:48.623
Oh yeah, that'd work.

06:51.427 --> 06:53.894
- Okay...
- There you go.

07:05.108 --> 07:08.309
- Okay, come here.
- Hey, what're doing?

07:08.311 --> 07:11.212
Well, we gotta get at
the wiring somehow, so...

07:11.214 --> 07:12.847
Yeah, the best way through
the floor is right here.

07:12.849 --> 07:15.249
- No, no, Dad, stop. Stop!
- Hey, hey, hey. What? Why?

07:15.251 --> 07:16.817
Why are you doing this?

07:16.819 --> 07:18.119
You know why we're doing this.

07:18.121 --> 07:19.587
Because the insurance company

07:19.589 --> 07:22.456
ordered that we bring
the electrical up to "code."

07:22.458 --> 07:25.559
That's why we're doing this.
Okay, but no. Dad, stop!

07:25.861 --> 07:28.598
There is no way you're going
through our brand new floor!

07:28.672 --> 07:29.938
There's gotta be a better way.

07:30.012 --> 07:32.499
And I told him that too,
but would he listen?

07:32.501 --> 07:35.836
'Kay, fine.
There is another way,

07:35.838 --> 07:39.440
but it is the opposite
of convenient.

07:39.442 --> 07:40.630
Here.

07:44.313 --> 07:47.848
Okay, I can, uh,
bring the new wiring

07:47.850 --> 07:51.518
down through here,
ceiling, over here.

07:51.520 --> 07:52.853
New breaker box there,

07:52.855 --> 07:54.321
tie it into the old junction box.

07:54.323 --> 07:55.756
Okay, so do that

07:55.758 --> 07:57.424
because there's no way
you're ripping up our floor.

07:57.426 --> 07:59.760
Yeah, well,
that would've been faster,

07:59.762 --> 08:02.930
but... who's in a rush, right?

08:02.932 --> 08:05.299
Oh wait, you two.

08:05.301 --> 08:08.135
Help me.

08:12.640 --> 08:14.775
Hey, Caleb. How are you doing?

08:14.777 --> 08:17.678
Not great. I think I got a problem.

08:17.680 --> 08:19.913
So this is Rusty.

08:19.915 --> 08:21.515
He's the one with the strained
tendon, right?

08:21.517 --> 08:23.484
Yeah, but it's totally healed.

08:23.486 --> 08:26.253
I've been hoping to get him back
on the circuit sometime this week,

08:26.255 --> 08:30.691
but... I mean, look at him.
He's just... not up to it.

08:30.693 --> 08:32.226
Well, he seems pretty lethargic.

08:32.227 --> 08:34.193
Yeah, and he doesn't have
much energy either,

08:34.196 --> 08:36.996
but I figure if anyone can
get him back on track, it's...

08:36.999 --> 08:38.298
it's you guys.

08:38.299 --> 08:40.801
Okay. And you're sure
his tendon's completely healed?

08:40.803 --> 08:43.636
A-Absolutely. Yeah. Hey?

08:43.639 --> 08:45.339
It could be his immune system.

08:45.341 --> 08:46.707
Sometimes with injuries like that,

08:46.709 --> 08:48.575
you know, everything heals,
but the horse is weakened.

08:48.577 --> 08:50.878
Yeah. I could put him on
some herbal supplements

08:50.880 --> 08:53.447
over the next few days
and see if that helps.

08:53.449 --> 08:54.882
Okay. That's the plan.

08:54.884 --> 08:57.484
I mean, just-just do whatever
you guys think is best.

08:57.486 --> 08:59.720
Look, between you and me,

08:59.722 --> 09:01.522
this guys could put me back
on the podium.

09:01.524 --> 09:03.657
I just... feel it.

09:07.545 --> 09:08.568
You guys should come inside

09:08.621 --> 09:10.330
and take a look at the pictures
on the hotel website.

09:10.332 --> 09:13.333
It's amazing.

09:13.335 --> 09:16.537
Hey, Georgie, is everything okay?

09:16.539 --> 09:20.340
- You seem... kinda distracted.
- Uh, yeah. I'm fine.

09:20.342 --> 09:23.644
I just gotta go check and see if
Phoenix has enough water in the barn.

09:23.646 --> 09:26.246
Okay, well, don't be long.

09:27.882 --> 09:29.316
Come on!

09:57.645 --> 10:00.481
Hi, Stinky and Minky. Hi!

10:00.483 --> 10:02.683
You guys don't bite, do you?

10:02.685 --> 10:04.451
You know, you're kinda funny looking.

10:04.453 --> 10:05.752
Hi there!

10:05.754 --> 10:07.521
Amy?!

10:07.523 --> 10:09.623
You down here?

10:13.896 --> 10:16.697
Amy?!

10:19.835 --> 10:22.035
So you're leaving in two weeks?

10:22.037 --> 10:23.570
Mm-hmm. Can't wait.

10:23.572 --> 10:25.639
Mm. Too humid for me.

10:25.641 --> 10:28.876
- You've never been.
- Never will.

10:28.878 --> 10:31.445
I am jealous. Why can' you
just take me with you, Lou?

10:31.447 --> 10:35.249
Any other time, but this is all
about me and my girls, right?

10:35.251 --> 10:38.719
Seven days of sand,
sea, and sunshine.

10:38.721 --> 10:40.754
Speaking of trips,
I just found out

10:40.756 --> 10:42.714
about an Extreme Team trip
I need to go on.

10:42.806 --> 10:43.268
When?

10:43.321 --> 10:44.625
It doesn't interfere
with our trip does it?

10:44.627 --> 10:46.627
No. No way. It's this weekend.

10:46.629 --> 10:48.529
We leave Friday after school
and get home Sunday.

10:48.531 --> 10:50.998
Hmm. Um, short notice.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.567
How come you didn't mention it
before?

10:53.569 --> 10:55.802
Well, it was kind of
a last minute thing.

10:55.804 --> 10:58.839
- Where is it?
- Jasper.

10:58.841 --> 11:01.708
Long drive. So who's going?

11:01.710 --> 11:03.744
- Everyone.
- The instructors and...

11:03.746 --> 11:06.346
Yeah, yeah. The usual.

11:06.348 --> 11:08.916
So can I go?

11:08.918 --> 11:10.584
Well, I gotta go check
on those possums,

11:10.586 --> 11:11.952
make sure they're doing okay.

11:11.954 --> 11:13.754
Possums!
What're you talking about?

11:13.756 --> 11:16.323
There's no possums in Alberta.

11:16.325 --> 11:20.894
Don't worry about it, Jack. They won't
be at Heartland for long, okay?

11:20.896 --> 11:23.063
The trip...?

11:23.065 --> 11:24.932
Let me think about it.

11:33.575 --> 11:35.943
Great. No power.

11:39.882 --> 11:42.349
How are you guys doing, huh?

11:46.554 --> 11:48.322
Oh, shoot.

11:57.865 --> 12:01.268
No! Remi wouldn't have
done that, Ty!

12:01.270 --> 12:03.637
And besides, those little guys
would've put up quite the fight

12:03.639 --> 12:06.740
and she doesn't have a mark
on her.

12:06.742 --> 12:08.075
Well, something happened to them.

12:08.077 --> 12:09.910
They didn't just get out
on their own.

12:09.912 --> 12:13.347
We'll find them, won't we.

12:15.184 --> 12:16.883
Well, it would help
if we had some lights in here

12:16.885 --> 12:19.186
so I could actually find
those little buggers.

12:19.188 --> 12:21.822
I find it kind of romantic.

12:21.824 --> 12:23.924
Don't you?

12:26.628 --> 12:28.562
Don't look so innocent.

12:28.564 --> 12:30.664
Ty!

12:43.578 --> 12:47.447
Hi, sweetheart. So what kind
of an event is this?

12:47.449 --> 12:48.949
I don't see it on your schedule.

12:48.951 --> 12:50.517
Well, it's not an "event" event.

12:50.519 --> 12:52.486
It's like a team building thing.

12:52.488 --> 12:54.788
A chance to bond
with the other girls.

12:54.790 --> 12:57.291
I'm the newest and it doesn't
help that I'm the youngest.

12:57.293 --> 12:58.892
This'll give me a chance
to get to know everyone

12:58.894 --> 13:01.762
and feel like I'm a true member
of the team.

13:01.764 --> 13:04.464
When I worked in New York,
we would do things like that.

13:04.466 --> 13:06.600
We had entire weekends
dedicated to learning

13:06.602 --> 13:10.404
to trust and rely
on our co-workers.

13:10.406 --> 13:12.072
- It was fun.
- Yeah, that's it.

13:12.074 --> 13:13.607
I knew you'd get it.

13:13.609 --> 13:15.042
It's just for building team spirit.

13:15.044 --> 13:16.476
It'll be amazing.

13:16.478 --> 13:18.245
Well, I will try not
to take it too personally

13:18.247 --> 13:22.182
that you're sounding more excited
about this trip than our trip.

13:22.184 --> 13:23.684
Well, of course
I'm excited about our trip.

13:23.686 --> 13:25.552
Spending a week at a hotel
on the beach,

13:25.554 --> 13:27.754
I've never done that before!
It'll be awesome!

13:27.756 --> 13:31.429
It will. And we deserve it,
you know?

13:33.197 --> 13:35.822
So can I go this weekend?

13:36.772 --> 13:38.799
Let me sleep on it.

13:40.301 --> 13:42.169
Good night.

13:44.423 --> 13:46.707
Don't stay up too late, okay?

14:04.258 --> 14:09.662
Hi, Dad! Yeah. I-I just
wanted to ask you a question.

14:09.664 --> 14:12.799
Um, I have a chance to go on
this really neat trip with the,

14:12.801 --> 14:14.100
with the Extreme Team
this weekend.

14:14.102 --> 14:17.003
I was just wondering
if I could go?

14:17.005 --> 14:18.404
Yeah, I just wanted to check

14:18.406 --> 14:21.941
and see if it was okay with you
before I ask Mom.

14:21.943 --> 14:24.544
So you're okay with it?

14:24.546 --> 14:28.181
Okay. Awesome! Thank you!
Okay. Love you!

14:28.183 --> 14:30.183
Okay, bye.

14:56.911 --> 14:59.345
There you go, bud. That's it...

15:06.721 --> 15:10.178
Yeah, that's a good boy.

15:11.792 --> 15:15.795
You like that, don't you, Rusty?!
Don't you?

15:17.899 --> 15:20.200
There you go...

15:44.198 --> 15:47.567
Hey, Rusty. Hi, baby.

15:47.569 --> 15:50.846
Let's see...

15:52.072 --> 15:54.374
- What're you doing?
- Shh-shh!

16:04.406 --> 16:07.119
Seriously, what's going on?

16:07.185 --> 16:09.956
I'm looking for the possums.
They escaped.

16:09.958 --> 16:11.803
Wait, they escaped?
You're kidding.

16:11.855 --> 16:15.595
No, I'm not kidding, unfortunately.

16:15.597 --> 16:18.331
I bet they made a new home
in here.

16:18.333 --> 16:21.735
It's nice and dark,
just like they like it.

16:27.075 --> 16:31.078
Can they survive in...
you know, a strange place?

16:34.349 --> 16:36.850
Well, they're pretty smart, but there
are lot of predators, Georgie.

16:36.852 --> 16:40.120
Not to mention the cold nights,
which their systems can't handle.

16:43.291 --> 16:45.722
Do you wanna help me look?

16:46.382 --> 16:48.762
No! I-I gotta go to school.

16:59.675 --> 17:02.409
So I've been thinking
about this Jasper trip

17:02.411 --> 17:05.345
and I need to talk to Peter
about it first, but...

17:05.347 --> 17:08.115
Well, I-I talked to him last night.

17:08.117 --> 17:09.549
You did?

17:09.550 --> 17:12.219
Yeah. He says he's okay
with it if you are.

17:12.221 --> 17:14.988
Oh. All right.

17:17.125 --> 17:19.326
So...?

17:19.328 --> 17:23.704
Well, okay. But I want
to talk to your coach,

17:24.499 --> 17:26.465
get a few more details.

17:26.468 --> 17:28.435
Wait, Trudie?

17:28.436 --> 17:31.505
Well, I... I think she's away...

17:31.507 --> 17:33.273
judging some event.

17:33.275 --> 17:36.743
I'm sure she still has
her phone, sweetie.

17:36.745 --> 17:41.581
Wait for Katie. You guys
can take the bus together.

17:41.583 --> 17:43.175
Georgie.

17:44.353 --> 17:47.420
Oh. Thank you.

17:49.757 --> 17:52.526
Katie, let's go!

17:52.528 --> 17:56.630
Okay. Hold the box steady.

17:56.632 --> 17:58.732
We'll just
drop a couple of these in,

17:58.734 --> 18:00.400
- we'll be done in no time!
- Shh, shh, shh!

18:00.402 --> 18:01.868
- Just hold it steady, please.
- No, shhh! Shhh!

18:01.870 --> 18:03.303
What is wrong with you?!

18:03.305 --> 18:07.073
I'm hearing something.
I hear... it's like a...

18:07.075 --> 18:09.676
It's like a whistling.

18:09.678 --> 18:12.579
You don't hear that? Seriously?

18:12.581 --> 18:14.381
I hear this, okay?

18:14.383 --> 18:17.584
Let's put this in here.
Okay, hold it. Steady.

18:17.586 --> 18:19.419
That's it. There it is!

18:19.421 --> 18:22.689
Oh, Jack, come on!

18:27.296 --> 18:29.629
Hey, Peter, it's me.

18:29.631 --> 18:32.566
Um, can you give me a call back
when you get a chance?

18:32.568 --> 18:35.435
There's just... something
I want to discuss with you.

18:35.437 --> 18:37.504
Okay. Thanks.

18:51.552 --> 18:53.386
Hi, Trudie. It's um...

18:53.388 --> 18:55.655
it's Lou Fleming, Georgie's mom.

18:55.657 --> 18:57.724
I'm good. Hey, do you have a minute?

18:57.726 --> 18:59.392
I just wanted to get
some more info

18:59.394 --> 19:02.229
about this team-building trip.

19:02.231 --> 19:03.597
The one this weekend, to Jasper.

19:03.599 --> 19:06.366
Georgie was telling me about it.

19:11.373 --> 19:13.340
Come on, Rusty.

19:13.342 --> 19:15.675
Get up! Get up!

19:18.779 --> 19:20.247
Come on.

19:20.249 --> 19:23.149
Amy, have you seen
those possums?

19:23.151 --> 19:24.417
Well, they weren't happy
in their cage,

19:24.419 --> 19:26.319
so maybe it's just as well.

19:26.321 --> 19:28.488
I hate not knowing
where those guys are.

19:28.490 --> 19:30.657
Aww...

19:30.659 --> 19:34.361
Did someone get too attached
to little Stinky and Minky?

19:35.897 --> 19:37.664
How's this guy doing?

19:37.666 --> 19:41.534
Well... he still doesn't have
a whole lot of energy.

19:41.536 --> 19:42.969
But... I don't know,

19:42.971 --> 19:44.638
I did take him for a big ride
up to Weber's Creek,

19:44.640 --> 19:47.540
so maybe he's still tired out.

19:47.542 --> 19:50.543
Hey, Rusty? What do you think?
Call it a day

19:50.545 --> 19:52.679
and fix you up some oats
and honey?

19:52.681 --> 19:54.681
Well, I gotta head
into the clinic.

19:54.683 --> 19:58.118
Can you do me a favour and just...
keep an eye out for those guys?

19:58.120 --> 20:01.121
Yes. I will send them
all your love.

20:01.123 --> 20:03.723
Thank you.

20:07.728 --> 20:09.729
Hey, Georgie.

20:20.209 --> 20:24.578
This trip? Trudie didn't know
anything about it.

20:24.580 --> 20:26.318
But she did tell me
there's a rumour going around

20:26.384 --> 20:29.234
that a bunch of the older girls are
driving to Jasper for the weekend.

20:29.339 --> 20:31.476
And it has nothing to do
with team building.

20:31.516 --> 20:33.969
Okay, maybe it doesn't,
but it's still important.

20:34.022 --> 20:35.803
I'm sorry I didn't tell you,
but if I had,

20:35.839 --> 20:37.357
you never would've said yes.

20:37.359 --> 20:38.859
Really? That's your excuse?!

20:38.861 --> 20:41.361
I have to go. Sam invited me.

20:41.363 --> 20:44.198
She's the most popular girl
on our team. In our school!

20:44.200 --> 20:45.699
And she asked me!

20:45.701 --> 20:47.468
Georgie, come on!
You know better than that!

20:47.470 --> 20:49.069
No. You don't understand!

20:49.071 --> 20:50.671
This is the first time
this group of girls

20:50.673 --> 20:52.706
have ever even noticed me!

20:52.708 --> 20:54.541
Half of them don't know my name
and the other half,

20:54.543 --> 20:56.043
they treat me like
a complete baby.

20:56.045 --> 20:59.780
- Don't exaggerate.
- I'm not exaggerating!

20:59.782 --> 21:01.048
This could be a real chance
for me

21:01.050 --> 21:03.317
to feel like a true member
of the team.

21:03.319 --> 21:05.953
These are nice girls, Lou.
Nothing bad's gonna happen.

21:05.955 --> 21:08.088
Okay. I get why you wanna go.

21:08.090 --> 21:09.923
What I don't get is why
you couldn't have been

21:09.925 --> 21:11.925
up front with me
in the first place.

21:11.927 --> 21:15.933
And that is why there is no way
I could say yes to this.

21:17.066 --> 21:20.501
Well, Dad said I could go,
so I'm going.

21:20.503 --> 21:22.836
Excuse me?
What did you tell him?

21:22.838 --> 21:24.638
That it was an event?

21:24.640 --> 21:26.340
That it was a team-building
experience?

21:26.342 --> 21:28.041
Because there is no way
he would have said yes

21:28.043 --> 21:29.777
if you told him the real story.

21:29.779 --> 21:31.645
Well, Dad doesn't grill me
like you do,

21:31.647 --> 21:33.781
because unlike you,
he actually trusts me!

21:33.783 --> 21:35.182
How can either of us trust you

21:35.184 --> 21:38.418
when you don't tell the truth
in the first place?

21:38.420 --> 21:40.654
You know, Georgie,
I am surprised at you,

21:40.656 --> 21:42.723
and I'm disappointed.

21:42.725 --> 21:45.859
You didn't have to handle it
this way.

21:48.964 --> 21:50.664
Peter, how could say yes
to this trip

21:50.666 --> 21:53.734
without knowing
all the details first?

21:53.736 --> 21:55.636
No! It is not a team trip.

21:55.638 --> 21:56.937
This is a bunch
of the older girls

21:56.939 --> 21:58.972
going on a joyride to Jasper.

21:58.974 --> 22:00.440
You think they're gonna be
drinking hot cocoa

22:00.442 --> 22:03.610
and going to bed early?

22:03.612 --> 22:05.445
Well, I don't understand
how you could say yes

22:05.447 --> 22:07.781
without talking to me first...

22:10.018 --> 22:11.785
Yes, okay.

22:13.588 --> 22:15.322
Well, this is a perfect example.

22:15.324 --> 22:19.526
You know, Georgie is becoming
an expert at working us.

23:02.304 --> 23:05.572
I spoke to your father
and we are agreed on this...

23:05.574 --> 23:07.941
there will be no Jasper trip.

23:07.943 --> 23:09.743
Why?

23:09.745 --> 23:13.914
Why? I can't even count
the reasons, Georgie.

23:13.916 --> 23:16.550
But most of all, because you weren't
honest with us about this trip

23:16.552 --> 23:19.453
and what it was really
all about.

23:19.455 --> 23:20.821
As it stands now,
neither of us feel

23:20.823 --> 23:23.190
you should even be allowed
to stay on the Extreme Team.

23:23.192 --> 23:25.592
- What?! That's not fair!
- You weren't fair!

23:25.594 --> 23:28.395
You lied to your dad
and you lied to me.

23:28.397 --> 23:30.797
You just sat there and told me
what you wanted me to hear.

23:30.799 --> 23:34.701
Isn't that true?
Georgie, isn't it?

23:34.703 --> 23:37.471
- Just leave me alone!
- Fine!

23:37.473 --> 23:39.840
I think you need
some alone time.

23:39.842 --> 23:42.776
I'm not some kid!

23:57.301 --> 23:59.834
Ty. Do you hear that?

24:00.862 --> 24:02.829
What?

24:03.375 --> 24:06.145
- Listen.
- What is it?

24:06.567 --> 24:09.636
I don't know.
Where is it coming from?

24:11.040 --> 24:13.927
Sounds like underneath
the floorboards.

24:14.777 --> 24:16.443
I know what that could be.

24:22.417 --> 24:23.917
I don't hear it anymore.

24:30.426 --> 24:32.592
Oh no. Ty!

24:34.529 --> 24:36.596
It's Rusty, he's sick.

24:46.194 --> 24:48.995
Come on, Rusty. You have
to drink something, please.

24:50.965 --> 24:53.866
Hey, guys! I got your message
to come by!

24:53.868 --> 24:56.335
Does this mean my boy's
good to go?

24:56.337 --> 24:58.805
Um... no.

24:58.807 --> 25:00.907
- Why, what's wrong?
- He's not eating or drinking.

25:00.909 --> 25:02.442
And it's like he's having
trouble swallowing,

25:02.485 --> 25:03.580
but we're not sure why yet.

25:03.646 --> 25:05.211
What do you mean you don't know why?

25:05.213 --> 25:07.246
The symptoms just started
this morning.

25:07.248 --> 25:09.282
I just sent some blood tests
to the lab, Caleb.

25:09.284 --> 25:11.017
Scott's gonna have
a look at them, too.

25:11.019 --> 25:12.318
But if he has a weakened
immune system,

25:12.320 --> 25:13.886
then he's more susceptible to disease.

25:13.888 --> 25:15.788
Maybe he's allergic to whatever
you guys are giving him?

25:15.790 --> 25:19.325
No. That's not possible. What we're
giving him is healthy and natural.

25:19.327 --> 25:21.027
Hey, listen to his breathing.

25:21.029 --> 25:22.428
I mean, what's going on, man?!

25:22.430 --> 25:24.363
We're gonna figure this out,
Caleb, okay? I promise.

25:24.365 --> 25:26.399
But in the meantime, I need to
move Rusty to an outside stall,

25:26.401 --> 25:28.501
because whatever he has
might be contagious.

25:28.503 --> 25:29.936
This is crazy!

25:29.938 --> 25:33.069
I brought him here
to get better, not worse!

25:37.027 --> 25:39.045
Wait up!

25:40.849 --> 25:42.882
Georgie?!

25:42.884 --> 25:45.218
Can you wait up, Georgie?!

25:45.220 --> 25:47.920
What's going on?

25:47.922 --> 25:50.156
That Jasper trip
Georgie was talking about?

25:50.158 --> 25:52.258
Nothing to do
with the Extreme Team.

25:52.260 --> 25:55.428
Just a bunch of the older girls
taking off for the weekend.

25:55.430 --> 25:58.097
She lied to both Peter and I about it.

25:58.099 --> 26:01.280
She's playing us off each other
like a pro.

26:01.903 --> 26:04.070
I don't know how
to handle this, Amy.

26:04.072 --> 26:06.105
You're doing great.

26:06.107 --> 26:09.709
Georgie's the one
who made a mistake here.

26:09.711 --> 26:11.570
And Lou,

26:12.213 --> 26:15.348
no matter how well you deal with
this whole separation thing,

26:15.350 --> 26:17.950
it's gonna be rough on Georgie.

26:17.952 --> 26:21.120
Yeah. It's rough on all of us.

26:21.122 --> 26:22.555
You know, and that's why
I was looking forward

26:22.557 --> 26:23.923
to this vacation so much.

26:23.925 --> 26:25.825
Just spending time with my girls.

26:25.827 --> 26:28.247
And now...

26:28.997 --> 26:31.631
Hey. I'll make you some coffee.

26:41.074 --> 26:45.311
Ty, what is it?
What does it say?

26:45.313 --> 26:48.014
The blood tests make it
look like it's EPM.

26:48.016 --> 26:50.082
I was afraid of this.

26:50.084 --> 26:51.717
The symptoms match exactly, Caleb.

26:51.719 --> 26:54.921
Difficulty breathing,
swallowing, eating, drinking.

26:54.923 --> 26:58.758
Okay, but... exactly what is EPM?

26:58.760 --> 27:01.575
Equine protozoal myeloencephalit...

27:03.063 --> 27:04.397
It's a neurological disease.

27:04.399 --> 27:06.966
Domestic cats, raccoons,
skunks...

27:06.968 --> 27:08.719
They can all be intermediary hosts,

27:08.824 --> 27:12.835
but it's mainly transmitted
by uh... possums.

27:14.774 --> 27:15.808
How?

27:15.810 --> 27:17.109
In their feces and their urine,

27:17.111 --> 27:18.611
there's something
called Protozoa.

27:18.613 --> 27:20.046
It's-it's very dangerous.

27:20.048 --> 27:22.915
And a possum does his business,
let's say on some hay,

27:22.917 --> 27:25.117
and Rusty were to eat that hay,

27:25.119 --> 27:26.586
he might as well have
swallowed poison.

27:26.588 --> 27:27.954
'Kay, no. That's impossible.

27:27.956 --> 27:29.755
We don't have possums in Alberta.

27:29.757 --> 27:31.958
I've never seen one.

27:31.960 --> 27:35.328
Look, Caleb, um...

27:35.330 --> 27:38.164
All right, Jack, I got...

27:38.166 --> 27:39.699
Do you hear that?

27:39.701 --> 27:42.835
Jack! Can you hear...
Three! Can you hear this?!

27:42.837 --> 27:44.237
Jeez! Jack!

27:44.239 --> 27:46.305
- Yes I can hear you.
- Okay, you can hear-okay.

27:46.307 --> 27:48.007
Okay. Can you hit the breaker...
Dad? Yes?

27:48.009 --> 27:50.476
Can you just keep it down? We're in
the middle of something, please.

27:50.478 --> 27:52.945
Well, I'm kind of in the
middle of something too, right?

27:52.947 --> 27:55.047
Huh? For you.

27:56.316 --> 27:59.218
Okay, just a second. And...

28:00.854 --> 28:02.255
Hit it!

28:02.257 --> 28:04.790
Yes sir,
everything's working!

28:04.792 --> 28:07.026
And you wanted to hire
an electrician!

28:07.028 --> 28:08.761
I don't think so...

28:08.763 --> 28:10.129
Ahhh!

28:11.900 --> 28:15.034
Possums.

28:15.036 --> 28:19.305
- Okay. This'll do the trick.
- That's not gonna hurt them, will it?

28:19.307 --> 28:23.175
- With any luck.
- No, no, it won't hurt 'em.

28:23.177 --> 28:25.444
I baited it with sardines, see?

28:25.446 --> 28:28.848
Let's just hope they like
what we're offering up.

28:28.850 --> 28:33.185
I'll stick it right up
in here... like so.

28:33.187 --> 28:35.321
Now all we have to do is wait.

28:37.225 --> 28:40.993
Possums.
Are you kidding me?

28:40.995 --> 28:44.463
Sorry this happened, Caleb.

28:44.465 --> 28:46.432
Let's just focus on getting
Rusty better, okay?

28:46.434 --> 28:51.304
Well, that hasn't exactly worked
out so well so far, has it, Ty?

28:51.306 --> 28:53.773
I brought him here because
he had a weak immune system

28:53.775 --> 28:55.775
and you poisoned my horse.

28:58.845 --> 29:01.647
I take full responsibility, Caleb.

29:01.649 --> 29:04.216
I'm still waiting to hear back
on some other tests,

29:04.218 --> 29:07.753
but if it is EPM, we're lucky
because it's at an early stage.

29:07.755 --> 29:10.122
But even if it isn't, okay,

29:10.124 --> 29:11.924
these drugs aren't gonna do
any harm.

29:11.926 --> 29:14.126
Only good.

29:14.128 --> 29:15.895
This will slow down the
reproduction of the Protozoa

29:15.897 --> 29:18.731
so his immune system
can kill the rest.

29:18.733 --> 29:21.334
Well, you told me that
he had a weak immune system.

29:21.336 --> 29:24.370
How's he supposed to fight it, hmm?

29:28.042 --> 29:31.978
I'm doing my best, Caleb! Okay?

29:31.980 --> 29:35.081
If you wanna hire another vet, I get it.

29:35.083 --> 29:39.185
No. Just...

29:39.187 --> 29:41.053
do it.

29:46.327 --> 29:50.096
That dirty hay's gotta go, Tim.

29:50.098 --> 29:52.999
What was Ty thinking bringing those
damn possums into this barn?

29:53.001 --> 29:54.600
He should've left them
at the animal reserve?

29:54.602 --> 29:55.935
Well, I'm sure if he could've,

29:55.937 --> 29:57.903
he would have, Dad.

30:00.208 --> 30:03.175
Bingo!

30:03.177 --> 30:05.411
What did I tell ya?

30:07.114 --> 30:09.482
Let's see what we got here, now.

30:09.484 --> 30:11.317
Oh yeah, look at this.

30:11.319 --> 30:15.221
Yes, sir.

30:15.223 --> 30:19.325
Amy, you thought I was the only
one who liked sardines.

30:22.163 --> 30:25.731
Look at that.

30:25.733 --> 30:28.634
Possums!

30:30.605 --> 30:32.738
Crazy pet people!

30:32.740 --> 30:35.174
They probably ordered
these guys online.

30:35.176 --> 30:37.343
Big business, you know. Big!

30:39.814 --> 30:42.581
I still can't believe
they caused it.

30:42.583 --> 30:45.818
How could the hay become
that toxic so fast?

30:45.820 --> 30:47.653
It usually takes weeks
for the poison to build up.

30:47.655 --> 30:50.289
If it's not EPM, what could it be?

30:50.291 --> 30:52.792
I don't know.

30:52.794 --> 30:54.660
I just missed a call from Scott.

31:01.935 --> 31:06.405
I tested Rusty's levels of an
enzyme called "cholinesterase."

31:06.407 --> 31:09.575
A low level is a bad sign...

31:09.577 --> 31:12.678
and his are extremely low.

31:12.680 --> 31:14.814
That's strong indicator
carbofuran poisoning,

31:14.816 --> 31:17.416
which has almost
the same symptoms as EPM.

31:17.418 --> 31:18.884
- Okay, but what is carbo...?
- Carbofuran.

31:18.886 --> 31:20.453
It's-it's found in pesticides.

31:20.455 --> 31:22.421
Rusty must have ingested
some recently.

31:22.423 --> 31:24.890
No. How? He's been here
a few days

31:24.892 --> 31:27.760
and I know exactly what he ate
the day before he got sick.

31:27.762 --> 31:30.362
Well, sometimes it can be
found in contaminated water.

31:30.364 --> 31:31.764
None of us are sick.

31:31.766 --> 31:34.033
I don't see how our water
could be contaminated.

31:34.035 --> 31:35.267
Uh...

31:37.604 --> 31:39.638
Amy, you said you went on a
ride with Rusty yesterday.

31:39.640 --> 31:41.440
- Yeah.
- Where'd you go?

31:41.442 --> 31:42.908
To Weber's Creek.

31:42.910 --> 31:45.344
- Did he have a drink?
- Yeah, he drank from the river,

31:45.346 --> 31:47.646
but it was crystal clear.

31:47.648 --> 31:50.182
Okay, I need you to show me
exactly where you were.

32:02.042 --> 32:06.112
Amy! That could be it.
See that garbage?

32:06.114 --> 32:08.481
I didn't come this far.
I never saw it.

32:08.483 --> 32:10.984
It's just been dumped here.

32:10.986 --> 32:12.285
Do you know if there's a farm
on this property?

32:12.287 --> 32:15.555
I don't think so.
I think it's a park reserve.

32:32.706 --> 32:33.973
I'm gonna take this
into the lab,

32:33.975 --> 32:36.042
get some tests done.

32:47.955 --> 32:49.192
Hey, Sam.

32:49.245 --> 32:50.824
So your mom told Trudie about
our little plan for the weekend

32:50.826 --> 32:52.525
and guess what?

32:52.527 --> 32:53.960
Trudie called all our mothers

32:53.962 --> 32:56.646
to tell them that there's no
Extreme Team event in Jasper.

32:56.804 --> 32:59.999
So we got shut down
thanks to you.

33:00.001 --> 33:03.136
I should have known you're not
mature enough to deal with this.

33:17.596 --> 33:19.997
So those girls were lying
to their parents too.

33:20.076 --> 33:22.455
Georgie, it serves them right
to get caught.

33:22.457 --> 33:24.958
Yeah, but they blame me!
They hate me now!

33:24.960 --> 33:27.293
I can't go back to school
or Extreme Team again.

33:27.295 --> 33:28.995
- Come on, Georgie.
- No, it's true!

33:28.997 --> 33:31.397
So it doesn't matter if you
won't let me go back to the team

33:31.399 --> 33:33.090
because it's all completely
ruined anyway!

33:33.170 --> 33:35.802
- And that's my fault?
- Well, I'm not the one who called Trudie!

33:35.804 --> 33:37.704
What kind of mother
would I be if I hadn't?

33:37.706 --> 33:39.806
A mother who trusts me!

33:39.808 --> 33:41.335
You know what? I don't wanna
go on the stupid "girl's trip"

33:41.428 --> 33:42.180
with you and Katie anymore!

33:42.277 --> 33:44.878
The last thing I wanna do is
spend time any time with you.

33:48.881 --> 33:50.917
So it had nothing to do
with possums whatsoever?

33:50.919 --> 33:53.186
No. Contaminated water.

33:53.188 --> 33:54.921
I found traces of a pesticide
in Weber's Creek.

33:54.923 --> 33:57.324
I am so sorry.
I took Rusty for a ride.

33:57.326 --> 33:59.893
I let him drink from the creek.
I had no idea.

33:59.895 --> 34:02.996
We need to get him started on injections
of atropine sulphite as soon as possible.

34:02.998 --> 34:04.965
It has a high success rate
of reversing the...

34:04.967 --> 34:07.667
Okay, that's-that's good
with the vet talk.

34:07.669 --> 34:10.407
I trust you. Let's just get
this fixed.

35:14.101 --> 35:16.670
Georgie.

35:16.672 --> 35:18.572
Can you knock?
What happened to privacy.

35:18.574 --> 35:20.674
We need to talk.

35:20.676 --> 35:23.009
Georgie!

35:33.454 --> 35:36.823
You need some exercise,
don't you, huh?

35:36.825 --> 35:39.974
Georgie too busy again?

35:40.795 --> 35:44.864
Yeah, I don't know when she's
gonna find time for you anymore.

35:44.866 --> 35:47.567
Please wait!

35:47.569 --> 35:52.967
Please stop, Georgie!
I can't go as fast as you!

35:53.274 --> 35:54.975
Hey, young lady!

35:54.977 --> 35:58.144
You need to exercise Phoenix
when you get home from school.

35:58.146 --> 36:00.747
- Wait!
- He's doing that weaving thing again!

36:00.749 --> 36:02.649
He's bored out of his mind!

36:02.651 --> 36:04.451
Georgie!

36:19.734 --> 36:22.736
He's breathing much easier.

36:22.738 --> 36:25.705
- You wanna give him some oats, Amy?
- Yeah.

36:25.707 --> 36:28.775
Hey, Rusty. You want some of that?

36:31.847 --> 36:34.648
That's a good boy.

36:34.650 --> 36:36.116
Yeah...

36:36.118 --> 36:38.551
I think he might get
to the podium after all.

36:43.624 --> 36:45.392
That's a good boy.

37:16.123 --> 37:17.957
You want a drink there, Phoenix?

37:32.040 --> 37:34.174
Good news! Rusty is way better,

37:34.176 --> 37:37.177
even after only two injections!

37:40.382 --> 37:43.049
What's the matter?

37:43.051 --> 37:46.252
Georgie and I got into
a huge fight last night.

37:46.254 --> 37:48.988
She said she doesn't want
to come on our trip anymore.

37:48.990 --> 37:51.124
She never wants to spend time
with me again.

37:51.126 --> 37:52.792
Lou, she doesn't actually
mean that.

37:52.794 --> 37:54.260
I know, but she left for school

37:54.262 --> 37:56.696
without even talking to me.
Without saying goodbye.

37:56.698 --> 38:00.400
Hey. Do you remember how many times
we did that when we were kids?

38:04.138 --> 38:06.706
Hello?

38:06.708 --> 38:08.641
Uh, yes, speaking.

38:13.014 --> 38:15.615
Are you sure? That's not
possible! She...

38:18.018 --> 38:20.787
I'll be right there!

38:22.357 --> 38:25.525
That was Georgie's school.
She didn't show up today.

38:25.527 --> 38:27.127
I don't believe this, Amy!

38:27.129 --> 38:29.996
She is skipping class
on top of everything else!

38:29.998 --> 38:31.431
If she thinks she can
get away with this

38:31.433 --> 38:33.867
she is so mistaken!

38:33.869 --> 38:35.702
I will ground her for a year!

38:48.357 --> 38:50.559
So? What's going on?

38:50.561 --> 38:52.794
I don't know.

38:55.833 --> 38:58.266
She didn't show up
at her first class.

38:58.268 --> 39:00.235
Then we ran into Jade.

39:00.237 --> 39:01.603
She had no idea
where she might be.

39:01.605 --> 39:03.371
Hasn't even seen her
for two days.

39:03.373 --> 39:05.807
Same thing with Adam.
Nobody knows.

39:05.809 --> 39:07.876
I thought she might've gone
to Jasper just to spite me,

39:12.516 --> 39:14.549
Yeah, me too.

39:14.551 --> 39:16.751
Katie, honey? Tell me something.

39:16.753 --> 39:18.286
When the school bus
dropped you off,

39:18.288 --> 39:20.355
did Georgie go in with you?

39:20.357 --> 39:22.757
Yeah. She took me
to kindergarten.

39:22.759 --> 39:25.894
Well, did you see
where she went after that?

39:30.968 --> 39:32.534
any minute, like nothing
happened.

39:32.536 --> 39:35.804
Yeah. You two had a fight,
didn't you say that?

39:38.542 --> 39:41.409
maybe she went to see
her brother in Fort Mac.

39:41.411 --> 39:42.878
So you think she ran away.

39:45.482 --> 39:46.982
Do we have a number for him?

39:46.984 --> 39:48.316
I do. Right here.

39:48.318 --> 39:51.486
It's ringing.

39:51.488 --> 39:54.623
I'm gonna try Peter again.

39:54.625 --> 39:57.726
Nah... he's not answering.
He must be at work.

39:57.728 --> 39:59.194
It's going straight
to voice-mail.

39:59.196 --> 40:00.829
Peter, pick up the phone.

40:00.831 --> 40:03.532
Jeff, it's Jack Bartlett here.

40:03.534 --> 40:05.667
I need you to call me back
when you get this.

40:05.669 --> 40:08.970
There's a chance that Georgie
might be on her way to see you

40:08.972 --> 40:13.475
and we need you to let us know
as soon as you hear anything,

40:13.477 --> 40:15.644
if you do. So... thanks.

40:15.646 --> 40:19.214
Peter. Call me back, please.

40:19.216 --> 40:22.384
Okay, I uh... I spoke to all
of Georgie's teammates.

40:22.386 --> 40:24.886
Not one of them had
any information.

40:24.888 --> 40:26.855
Now she has been missing
since this morning,

40:26.857 --> 40:29.858
so we can't sit around and wait.

40:29.860 --> 40:33.562
We need to call the hospitals
and Lou, we...

40:36.567 --> 40:39.301
- Now, Amy...
- This can't be happening...

40:39.303 --> 40:42.003
Just stay with-with Lou,
please. Call the hospitals.

41:08.898 --> 41:12.500
Okay, well, if you hear anything
from her, Jeff, you get in touch.

41:12.502 --> 41:14.869
So she's not in Fort Mac?

41:14.871 --> 41:17.806
Oh yeah, we'll let you know
from this end too. You bet.

41:19.609 --> 41:21.843
I was at the police station.
I spoke to Officer Radkey.

41:21.845 --> 41:25.013
She's going to be in touch
with you.

41:25.015 --> 41:26.648
Any news?

41:28.884 --> 41:33.288
I can't stand this.
I gotta try her phone again.

41:37.693 --> 41:39.494
Please, answer the phone, Georgie.

41:39.496 --> 41:41.930
Please...

42:09.359 --> 42:12.827
She doesn't want me
to find her.
