{\an8}From the scores of nominees,
we've singled out 20 finalists

01:18.161 --> 01:22.332
{\an8}five of whom will be offered
the opportunity to study

01:22.415 --> 01:24.626

Coming, Ma!

{\an8}Ginger, I
can not believe

01:40.809 --> 01:42.519
{\an8}you applied
for that fellowship

01:42.602 --> 01:45.021
without telling us.

01:45.104 --> 01:47.315
{\an1}Well, I'm sure
I'm not going to get in.

01:47.398 --> 01:49.859
{\an1}Oh, but you guys,
the campus is so cool.

{\an1}It's up
in the mountains,

01:51.736 --> 01:54.531

{\an5}then you'd be

02:18.763 --> 02:20.974
for a whole

02:23.685 --> 02:28.022
Away from my family
might not be such a bad thing.

Nothing.

03:57.862 --> 03:59.822
would you

03:59.906 --> 04:01.282
I mean, what I'm asking is

04:01.366 --> 04:03.493
are you really prepared
to be away from us

for that long?

04:05.244 --> 04:07.246
{\an1}I'm not going
to get in, Dodie, okay?

04:07.330 --> 04:09.123

04:30.228 --> 04:32.689
{\an1}there she is
causing me discomfort.

04:32.772 --> 04:34.482

04:38.027 --> 04:40.405
and there's nothing
anyone can do about it.

What if I told you

04:41.948 --> 04:45.535
there's already been
something done about it?

{\an5}CARL:
Truth is,
the hypothermia balm

04:47.537 --> 04:48.955
didn't really
work that well.

04:49.038 --> 04:50.498
And even if it did,

04:50.581 --> 04:52.041
I'm not sure
it's weird enough

04:52.125 --> 04:54.460
to get me into the
Weird Human Winter Fest.

{\an5}HOODSEY:
Cheesecake pudding sounds kind
of icky, but it actually isn't.

04:59.132 --> 05:00.967
I've got
to come up with

05:01.050 --> 05:03.302
{\an5}something really
unique, truly weird.

05:01.050 --> 05:03.302
Want?

05:03.386 --> 05:05.680
Hoodsey, can't you
think about something

05:05.763 --> 05:07.181
other than cheesecake
pudding for a minute?

05:07.265 --> 05:10.351
Well, I could say
the same thing to you

05:10.435 --> 05:11.477
about the
Weird Human Winter Fest.

05:11.561 --> 05:16.024
Look, why don't you just repeat
one of the weirdo things

05:16.107 --> 05:17.608
you've done in the past.

05:17.692 --> 05:19.402
Go as wolfboy or something.

05:19.485 --> 05:20.987
I'll just pretend
I didn't hear that.

05:21.070 --> 05:23.865
Originality is
what separates me

05:23.948 --> 05:25.700
from the rest
of the hacks

05:25.783 --> 05:28.411
and once you start
ripping yourself off,

05:28.494 --> 05:29.912
you're
no better than...

05:29.996 --> 05:31.372
Gentlemen... Hoodsey,

pudding, I see.

05:34.334 --> 05:35.460

What do you want,
Gripling?

05:37.128 --> 05:39.422
We're busy pretending
that you don't exist.

05:39.505 --> 05:40.882
Oh, really?

05:40.965 --> 05:42.091
Well, that task
is about to become

05:42.175 --> 05:44.677
infinitely harder, I'd say,

05:44.761 --> 05:47.263
what with my pending
debut on the telly.

That's right, Foutley,

of the venue?

Human Winter Fest?

05:57.732 --> 06:01.611

would that <i> ever</i> happen.

had a president,

you'd be mayor.

06:08.576 --> 06:09.619
No, president.

06:09.702 --> 06:11.245
Yeah, president.

{\an1}it was going
to turn out that way.

07:41.043 --> 07:42.962
Oh, that is great,
Ginger, just great.

Ditto.

07:50.928 --> 07:52.680
This news
is so fantastic.

07:52.763 --> 07:53.389
I'm even thinking

07:53.472 --> 07:55.975
of throwing a
bon voyage party...

07:59.478 --> 08:01.772
I'd chase
after her, too,

08:01.856 --> 08:05.359
but my bronchial passages
are already a tad constricted.

08:05.443 --> 08:08.404

in just making it a brisk walk.

How is this possible?

and they choose Ginger?

08:19.415 --> 08:20.583
It doesn't add up.

08:20.666 --> 08:22.251
It's not like she invented

08:22.335 --> 08:24.670
a cure for the common cold
or something.

08:24.754 --> 08:26.464
This was a big
year for Ginger.

08:26.547 --> 08:27.632
Macie, stop.

08:27.715 --> 08:28.883
I really expected

08:28.966 --> 08:31.344
that my best friend
would <i> try</i> to be happy

if something great
like this

isn't the case,

the tonsils!

09:21.811 --> 09:23.938
I meant no harm.

09:24.021 --> 09:26.524
Tell it to the
fleshy mounds, baby.

09:26.607 --> 09:28.901
Hoodsey...
did you see that?

09:28.985 --> 09:33.322
She was moving things around
without using her hands.

09:33.406 --> 09:35.074
Yeah, I saw it,
Carl, but...

09:35.157 --> 09:36.867
Do it again.

09:45.042 --> 09:48.004
What a bug out.

09:48.087 --> 09:50.840
{\an1}Woman, you have
Weird Human Winter Fest

09:50.923 --> 09:53.092
written all over you.

09:53.175 --> 09:56.512
{\an1}And Gripling's derriere
can't hold a candle to you!

09:56.596 --> 09:58.139
(<i> Carl hoots</i> )

09:59.181 --> 10:02.268
She's not happy for me,
she doesn't want me to go

10:02.351 --> 10:05.021
and she's acting like this whole
thing was designed

10:05.104 --> 10:05.771
to hurt <i> her</i> feelings.

10:05.855 --> 10:08.024
{\an4}LOIS:
Honey, Dodie's
just worried

10:08.107 --> 10:10.443
{\an1}about her best friend
being away for so long.

10:10.526 --> 10:12.820
{\an1}We're not talking
about a summer session

10:12.903 --> 10:14.363
at Camp Caprice here.

10:14.447 --> 10:17.408
Such a change is bound
to rattle the nerves a little.

10:17.491 --> 10:19.035
Tell me about it.

10:19.118 --> 10:21.203
But that's why
I need her support.

10:21.287 --> 10:23.331
I mean, my nerves
are rattled, too.

10:23.414 --> 10:24.206
Accepting
that fellowship

10:24.290 --> 10:27.501
would change my
whole entire life.

10:27.585 --> 10:29.211
But change could be good.

10:29.295 --> 10:30.713
{\an1}In fact, ever since
I made the big change

10:30.796 --> 10:34.633
{\an1}from Lycra to cotton
I've been far less irritable.

10:34.717 --> 10:35.885
Uh...

10:35.968 --> 10:38.721
In my room thinking it
over if you need me.

10:38.804 --> 10:40.931
{\an1}Well, don't
fill up on bread!

10:42.808 --> 10:44.894
{\an5}DODIE:
I don't want
to hold Ginger back.

10:44.977 --> 10:47.563
Honest, I don't,

10:47.646 --> 10:51.400
but this is like my worst
nightmare totally coming true.

10:51.484 --> 10:54.612
She's... she's my best friend.

10:54.695 --> 10:57.239
(<i> sobbing</i> )

10:57.323 --> 10:59.033
We're all best friends.

10:59.116 --> 11:00.409
But Ginger won't be
gone forever, Dodie.

11:00.493 --> 11:03.788
Yeah, it's just
one semester.

11:03.871 --> 11:05.873
Just one semester?

11:05.956 --> 11:07.500
Just one semester?!

11:07.583 --> 11:11.670
Do you have any idea
how much can happen

11:11.754 --> 11:13.381
in just one semester?!

11:13.464 --> 11:15.424
(<i> Dodie whimpering</i> )

11:15.508 --> 11:18.761
My bangs could be
totally grown out by then

11:18.844 --> 11:21.180
just to put it
into perspective.

11:21.263 --> 11:22.556
Good grief.

11:22.640 --> 11:25.893
Look, this is an awesome
opportunity for Ginger,

11:25.976 --> 11:28.354
and both of you should try
behaving accordingly.

11:28.437 --> 11:30.356
Ginger going away
for a little while

11:30.439 --> 11:33.567
isn't the end of the world,
even if it feels like it, okay?

11:33.651 --> 11:38.030
It's the end
of the world-- run!

11:42.701 --> 11:47.832
Cannibal from space,
cannibal from space.

11:47.915 --> 11:51.544
(<i> people screaming</i> )

11:53.587 --> 11:56.882
(<i> moaning in fear</i> )

11:56.966 --> 11:58.801
(<i> munching</i> )

11:58.884 --> 12:00.594
Cannibal from space.

12:00.678 --> 12:03.347
Giant cannibal
from space.

12:03.431 --> 12:05.099
Hey, Noelle, pass me my drink

12:05.182 --> 12:07.226
using your telekinetic powers,
would you?

12:07.309 --> 12:08.853
(<i> big sigh</i> )

12:12.731 --> 12:14.567
So cool.

12:14.650 --> 12:15.860
(<i> knock</i> )

12:15.943 --> 12:17.486
Would you get that, Noelle--

12:17.570 --> 12:21.365
you know, using your
telekinetic powers.

12:21.449 --> 12:23.367
Telekinetic powers.

12:23.451 --> 12:24.493
Telekinetic powers.

12:24.577 --> 12:27.204
It's all you ever
talk about anymore!

12:27.288 --> 12:31.292
Noelle-- the door.

12:31.375 --> 12:32.251
Whoof!

12:32.334 --> 12:33.669
Stand back.

12:33.752 --> 12:35.671
{\an3}So cool!

12:35.754 --> 12:37.715
{\an1}NOELLE:
I'm really angry.

12:37.798 --> 12:39.842
See you later, Noelle.

12:39.925 --> 12:41.552
Is she the greatest,
or what?

12:41.635 --> 12:43.179
Hmph! "Do not disturb."

12:43.262 --> 12:45.681
We should put this
on your sister's door.

12:45.764 --> 12:47.099
I'm guessing
it's too late for you.

12:47.183 --> 12:49.560
Don't I know it.

12:49.643 --> 12:52.104
{\an5}You here to watch
<i>Giant Cannibal</i>
<i>From Space?</i>

12:52.188 --> 12:54.190
It's the part where
he demands to eat

12:54.273 --> 12:57.526
the leader of
our natural habitat.

12:57.610 --> 12:58.777
{\an1}As the leader of
your natural habitat,

12:58.861 --> 13:02.448
{\an4}I just came by
to tell you that
it's time for dinner.

13:02.531 --> 13:03.532
What are we having?

13:03.616 --> 13:06.785
{\an1}Human carnage--
what else?

13:06.869 --> 13:10.039
{\an5}GINGER:
<i>The strangest thing is when you</i>
<i>finally get what you wish for</i>

13:10.122 --> 13:13.709
<i>and then suddenly you're not</i>
<i>sure if you want it anymore,</i>

13:13.792 --> 13:16.462
<i>and then you don't know</i>
<i>what to wish for.</i>

13:16.545 --> 13:20.216
But come on-- outdoor classes,

13:20.299 --> 13:22.760
half of your day
devoted to electives.

13:22.843 --> 13:25.054
And the kids look really cool.

13:25.137 --> 13:26.639
So you out of
here, or what?

13:26.722 --> 13:28.224
Currently?

13:28.307 --> 13:29.892
Undecided.

13:29.975 --> 13:31.143
Hmm, I see.

13:31.227 --> 13:33.896
{\an5}Well, I'm working
on the girls,
just in case.

13:33.979 --> 13:35.606
Has Dodie mellowed out?

13:35.689 --> 13:36.732
Not really.

13:36.815 --> 13:38.651
But maybe when you
board that bus.

13:38.734 --> 13:40.611
{\an1}You mean,
if I board that bus.

13:40.694 --> 13:41.695
No, Ginger.

13:41.779 --> 13:43.739
I mean <i> when</i>
you board that bus.

13:43.822 --> 13:45.699
Because if there's
one thing I've learned

13:45.783 --> 13:48.410
{\an1}living next door to you
it's that you're destined

13:48.494 --> 13:50.287
for things greater
than Sheltered Shrubs.

13:50.371 --> 13:51.413
Oh, Darren.

13:51.497 --> 13:54.708
Don't forget me,
Ginger, okay?

13:57.044 --> 13:59.255
(<i> sighs deeply</i> )

13:59.338 --> 14:01.298
I'm going.

14:05.553 --> 14:10.432
(<i> lively conversations</i> )

14:10.516 --> 14:12.601
(<i> chickens clucking</i> )

14:12.685 --> 14:15.729
{\an5}CARL:
You nervous?
Don't be.

14:15.813 --> 14:16.689
I'm not, Carl.

14:16.772 --> 14:17.940
Do you need a drink?

14:18.023 --> 14:18.607
A mint?

14:18.691 --> 14:21.068
A shoulder massage?

14:21.151 --> 14:22.778
Um, no thanks, Carl.

14:22.861 --> 14:24.154
Good, that's good.

14:24.238 --> 14:25.489
Don't be
intimidated.

14:25.573 --> 14:27.408
I'm not intimidated, Carl!

14:27.491 --> 14:28.450
Shouldn't be.

14:28.534 --> 14:30.452
They ain't got
nothing on you.

14:30.536 --> 14:31.579
You sure about that mint?

14:31.662 --> 14:34.748
(<i> chickens cackling</i> )

14:34.832 --> 14:36.625
Is it me he loves,

14:36.709 --> 14:39.211
or my
telekinetic powers?

14:39.295 --> 14:42.548
{\an1}Your telekinetic
powers, duh!

14:42.631 --> 14:44.091
But so what?

14:47.386 --> 14:50.139
Sir, perhaps
you should rise

14:50.222 --> 14:51.015
and trot about
for a spell.

14:51.098 --> 14:54.310
{\an5}Wouldn't want
any discoloration
to set in.

14:54.393 --> 14:56.020
No worries, Winston.

14:56.103 --> 14:58.230
{\an1}The hiney is in top
condition, as always.

14:58.314 --> 15:01.025
Of course, sir.

15:05.613 --> 15:07.489
Higsby, not you, too.

15:07.573 --> 15:10.117
You better believe it.

15:10.200 --> 15:12.536
{\an1}I'm working on
something extra weird.

15:12.620 --> 15:14.788
{\an1}Did you see
the turtle eater?

15:14.872 --> 15:15.706
Talk about disturbing.

15:15.789 --> 15:17.833
You're not Weird-Fest
material, Higsby.

15:17.916 --> 15:21.253
Why don't you pack it
up and bring it home.

15:21.337 --> 15:22.838
Not Weird-Fest material?

15:22.921 --> 15:24.506
{\an1}Perhaps you'd like
a little preview

15:24.590 --> 15:27.801
{\an1}of my
Ooga-Booga Dance.

15:29.386 --> 15:31.013
(<i> breathes deeply</i> )

15:32.222 --> 15:34.725
Ooga-Booga!

15:36.935 --> 15:38.520
(<i> giggles foolishly</i> )

15:38.604 --> 15:40.564
{\an1}Don't tell anyone else
what I've got worked up.

15:40.648 --> 15:43.901
{\an1}Okay? Promise.
Promise?

15:43.984 --> 15:44.526
No worries, Higsby.

15:44.610 --> 15:47.363
Your secret
is safe with me.

15:47.446 --> 15:50.532
{\an4}MIPSY:
Tell Uncle Maurice
the offer came through

15:50.616 --> 15:53.202
{\an4}and big thanks
for doing your
part, okay?

15:53.285 --> 15:55.037
I transferred you the money

15:55.120 --> 15:57.998
from my Bat-Mitzvah account
as discussed.

15:58.082 --> 15:59.333
Mipsy, wait.

15:59.416 --> 16:01.085
What do you think
it would take

16:01.168 --> 16:04.546
{\an5}to make Operation
Transfer Girl a bit
more permanent?

16:04.630 --> 16:05.631
Permanent?

16:05.714 --> 16:09.593
As in getting rid
of Foutley forever.

16:09.677 --> 16:10.969
Forever!

16:11.053 --> 16:16.183
{\an1}Miranda-- you just
gave me a brilliant idea.

16:23.482 --> 16:27.027
(<i> crowd murmuring excitedly</i> )

16:27.111 --> 16:29.905
WINSTON:
Step aside-- as you were.

16:29.988 --> 16:31.824
(<i> whispering</i> ):
Telekinetic girl.

16:31.907 --> 16:32.324
Telekinetic girl.

16:32.408 --> 16:34.326
Where are you?

16:34.410 --> 16:37.246
Mole butt, mole butt.

16:37.329 --> 16:39.331
Show me the mole butt!

16:39.415 --> 16:40.332
{\an1}He did it.

16:40.416 --> 16:40.791
Yes!

16:40.874 --> 16:41.458
Mr. Gripling did it.

16:41.542 --> 16:43.961
We're in, we're in!

16:44.044 --> 16:46.213
{\an1}WINSTON:
All hail, Teresa!

16:48.090 --> 16:48.424
Ooga-Ooga Dance.

16:48.507 --> 16:50.426
Am I on there?

16:50.509 --> 16:51.176
Am I on there?

16:53.011 --> 16:54.471
I just have to be on there.

16:54.555 --> 16:55.681
Let me see.

16:55.764 --> 16:57.933
There must be
some mistake.

16:58.016 --> 17:02.062
{\an5}My mom said
it was super
weird and scary.

17:02.146 --> 17:05.607
(<i> hysterically</i> ):
Super weird and scary!

17:05.691 --> 17:08.609
(<i> sobbing</i> )

17:08.694 --> 17:11.363
Tough break, Higsby.

17:11.446 --> 17:12.781
Aw.

17:12.865 --> 17:15.992
Well, there is always
next year, I suppose.

17:19.704 --> 17:21.498
Is she in, is she in?

17:21.582 --> 17:24.126
She's... in.

17:25.461 --> 17:29.715
(<i> all hooting</i> )

17:39.683 --> 17:44.104
And I guess I really am
happy for you... sort of.

17:44.188 --> 17:45.647
And?

17:45.731 --> 17:47.649
And I take back
what I said about

17:47.733 --> 17:49.943
not knowing how in
the world you got it.

17:50.027 --> 17:50.819
Because?

17:50.903 --> 17:52.279
Because you
deserve it, Ginger.

17:52.362 --> 17:54.573
{\an1}And?

17:54.656 --> 17:56.867
And I'm really sorry

17:56.950 --> 17:58.327
I wasn't more
supportive.

17:58.410 --> 18:00.329
Okay?

18:00.412 --> 18:01.663
{\an1}Okay.

18:01.747 --> 18:03.332
Okay.

18:03.415 --> 18:05.417
{\an1}I'm going to
miss you, too, Dodie.

18:05.501 --> 18:06.710
A lot.

18:06.794 --> 18:09.129
Just so you know.

18:09.213 --> 18:11.215
BOTH:
Oh.

18:11.298 --> 18:14.551
So sweet it could
turn me diabetic...

18:14.635 --> 18:17.096
knock wood.

18:22.142 --> 18:25.062
Excuse me, but why
are you two girls

18:25.145 --> 18:27.564
locked in a
heartfelt embrace?

18:27.648 --> 18:28.607
Oh, we're saying
good-bye, Courtney.

18:28.690 --> 18:30.734
I'm leaving tomorrow.

18:30.818 --> 18:32.569
Didn't you hear
the announcement?

18:32.653 --> 18:34.613
{\an5}I don't listen
to the announcements,
you know that.

18:34.696 --> 18:36.865
Ginger has
been accepted

18:36.949 --> 18:38.951
into the Avalanche Arts Academy.

18:39.034 --> 18:41.411
She'll be gone
for a whole semester.

18:41.495 --> 18:44.957
{\an1}Oh, I don't like
the sound of that one bit.

18:45.040 --> 18:45.791
TEACHER:
Sorry to interrupt.

18:45.874 --> 18:48.085
Ginger, think
you might be up

18:48.168 --> 18:51.755
for performing a little
farewell piece tomorrow?

18:51.839 --> 18:53.006
{\an5}Something to
say good-bye
to all your fans

18:53.090 --> 18:55.300
before you disappear
into the limelight.

18:55.384 --> 18:57.386
Disappear?

18:57.469 --> 18:59.304
She's joking...
really.

18:59.388 --> 19:00.055
You won't even
know I'm gone

19:00.138 --> 19:02.724
and I'll be back
before you know it.

19:02.808 --> 19:05.894
{\an5}Courtney, your
udon noodles are
getting cold.

19:05.978 --> 19:07.813
They're supposed to be cold.

19:07.896 --> 19:10.065
Well, then
they're getting warm.

19:10.148 --> 19:12.025
Let's go!

19:12.109 --> 19:13.694
Did you hear anything

19:13.777 --> 19:15.863
{\an1}about this Ginger Foutley
going away business?

19:15.946 --> 19:19.074
I think I did
hear something about it.

19:19.157 --> 19:20.826
Yes.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.663
{\an1}HOODSEY:
"Each entrant..."

19:24.746 --> 19:25.581
That's me.

19:25.664 --> 19:29.293
{\an1}"...will be allowed
one traveling companion."

19:29.376 --> 19:30.335
That's me.

19:30.419 --> 19:31.336
What about me?

19:31.420 --> 19:32.421
Keep reading.

19:32.504 --> 19:34.715
"In addition, if the entrant

19:34.798 --> 19:37.259
is under the age of 18..."

19:37.342 --> 19:38.385
And I am.

19:38.468 --> 19:40.512
"...a chaperone
will be required to attend."

19:40.596 --> 19:41.555
That's you.

19:41.638 --> 19:43.557
{\an1}A chaperone?
Oh, no.

19:43.640 --> 19:45.100
No adult is going to agree

19:45.183 --> 19:46.935
{\an1}to take us
to the Freak Fest.

19:47.019 --> 19:48.437
Carl, I said that's him.

19:48.520 --> 19:49.730
Didn't you hear me?

19:49.813 --> 19:50.731
Hoodsey?

19:50.814 --> 19:52.024
Your chaperone?

19:52.107 --> 19:53.692
Give me a break.

19:53.775 --> 19:56.612
{\an1}Yeah, I get carded
when I try and do PG-13.

19:56.695 --> 19:58.447
The boy
is too young.

19:58.530 --> 20:02.659
Ah, but with the help of stage
makeup, a woolen vest,

20:02.743 --> 20:05.454
and a pair of
simple drywall stilts,

20:05.537 --> 20:08.624
why, Hoodsey can become
my chaperone.

20:08.707 --> 20:10.292
My mom would freak.

20:10.375 --> 20:11.919
I like the sound of it.

20:12.002 --> 20:13.086
I like the way your mind works.

20:13.170 --> 20:17.257
I like the way you like me,
I have to admit.

20:17.341 --> 20:21.219
Now, feed me the leader
of your natural habitat.

20:26.516 --> 20:27.643
Yoo-hoo, girls!

20:27.726 --> 20:30.479
{\an8}MACIE:
Oh, what an
unexpected delight.

20:30.562 --> 20:32.814
Typically we don't
do much socializing.

20:32.898 --> 20:35.317
Yes, well... I just
wanted to tell you

20:35.400 --> 20:37.235
that I am positively miserable

20:37.319 --> 20:40.030
about the idea
of our Ginger going away.

20:40.113 --> 20:41.448
Oh, me too, Courtney.

20:41.531 --> 20:43.075
I know exactly how you feel.

20:43.158 --> 20:43.992
In fact, I...

20:44.076 --> 20:45.994
{\an1}Please, Dodie,
I'm emoting.

20:46.078 --> 20:47.371
{\an3}Carry on.

20:47.454 --> 20:48.497
As I was saying,

20:48.580 --> 20:50.040
{\an1}I am positively
miserable

20:50.123 --> 20:52.626
{\an1}about the idea
of Ginger going away.

20:52.709 --> 20:54.419
{\an1}For some reason
it reminds me

20:54.503 --> 20:55.837
exactly of how I felt

20:55.921 --> 20:57.839
when my favorite character
was killed off

20:57.923 --> 20:59.633
on the soap opera

20:57.923 --> 20:59.633
<i>Loves of our Lives.</i>

20:59.716 --> 21:00.884
BOTH:
Jocelyn.

21:00.968 --> 21:02.386
The very same.

21:02.469 --> 21:04.137
In any case, to help me cope

21:04.221 --> 21:07.182
with the unforeseen
trauma of this event

21:07.265 --> 21:09.893
I'll need the help of you,
Ginger's closest friends.

21:09.977 --> 21:12.729
This is it, this is it!

21:12.813 --> 21:15.399
I want you girls
to spend as much time around me

21:15.482 --> 21:17.859
as I can possibly tolerate,
to help ease my suffering.

21:17.943 --> 21:20.404
{\an1}We'd be honored,
Courtney.

21:20.487 --> 21:22.656
So should we head
over to your place?

21:22.739 --> 21:23.740
Snacks and study
group sound good?

21:23.824 --> 21:26.243
Oh, don't be absurd.

21:26.326 --> 21:27.995
Ginger's not gone yet.

21:28.078 --> 21:29.037
Unbelievable.

21:29.121 --> 21:30.205
It's like every...

21:30.288 --> 21:30.831
Don't even have to say it.

21:30.914 --> 21:33.417
I know what you're thinking.

21:33.500 --> 21:36.044
Every cloud has a silver lining.

21:36.128 --> 21:37.754
Does it not?

21:43.135 --> 21:45.345
Bunk with me
tonight, huh?

21:45.429 --> 21:46.596
Okay.

21:46.680 --> 21:49.224
I'm not moving away forever,

21:49.307 --> 21:52.060
so why does it feel like I am?

21:52.144 --> 21:54.896
{\an4}Whenever I'm feeling
overwhelmed,
I just say...

21:54.980 --> 21:56.314
(<i> honking</i> )

21:56.398 --> 21:59.860
Cool your jetski, Massabi--
be down in a minute!

21:59.943 --> 22:01.236
Hey!

22:01.319 --> 22:01.945
Guess I'd better get

22:02.029 --> 22:04.197
some of these boxes
down there.

22:04.281 --> 22:09.327
{\an1}Guess I better get ready
for Miranda's party.

22:09.411 --> 22:11.913
Take a couple
of deep breaths, Ging.

22:11.997 --> 22:13.248
Your stuff
may be leaving tonight,

22:13.331 --> 22:16.918
but you've still got
a little more time.

22:17.002 --> 22:19.546
(<i> door squeaks</i> )

22:19.629 --> 22:22.507
{\an5}GINGER:
<i>A little more time</i>
<i>to talk to my mom,</i>

22:22.591 --> 22:25.594
<i>a little more time to hang out</i>
<i>with my friends,</i>

22:25.677 --> 22:29.723
<i>a little more time before life</i>
<i>as I know it grinds to a halt</i>

22:29.806 --> 22:33.852
<i>and then...</i>
<i>miraculously begins again.</i>

22:35.437 --> 22:38.065

{\an8}Of course, sir.
