10:11.911 --> 10:14.380

18:36.849 --> 18:39.084
[applause]

18:39.151 --> 18:42.254
- Well, if it isn't
the Big Kahuna CEO himself.

18:42.321 --> 18:44.223
Chris, would you mind
giving me a hand here?

18:44.289 --> 18:45.824
- Yeah, sure. Why not?
- All right.

18:45.891 --> 18:50.162
This is a closed door meeting
between you, the CEO, and Amy.

18:50.229 --> 18:51.330
- Okay.

18:51.396 --> 18:55.167
So Amy, I wanted
to call you in here today

18:55.234 --> 18:58.904
to tell you what a wonderful
employee you are.

18:58.971 --> 19:00.939
- Uh...
- Props.

19:01.006 --> 19:03.408
- Yeah. Thank you.
That's so good to hear.

19:03.475 --> 19:06.712
- And I expect great things
from you, kid.

19:06.778 --> 19:07.846
Okay?

19:07.913 --> 19:09.948
- What?
- Oh, he touched her.

19:10.015 --> 19:12.284
He's not supposed to do that.
- Yes.

19:12.351 --> 19:14.386
Unwanted physical touch
is considered

19:14.453 --> 19:16.188
one of the worst forms
of workplace harassment.

19:16.255 --> 19:18.991
- Okay, this is so
anti-Semitic, are you serious?

19:19.057 --> 19:21.693
- Moving on, Annie.

19:21.760 --> 19:23.795
Come on up.
Could you stand up?

19:23.862 --> 19:25.998
You are about to leave
the building together.

19:26.064 --> 19:27.633
It's raining outside.

19:27.699 --> 19:29.201
Annie has an umbrella.

19:29.268 --> 19:30.769
Amy does not.

19:30.836 --> 19:32.137
So, Annie, yeah, if you could
pretend to have an umbrella.

19:32.204 --> 19:34.873
- So you have
an Orthodox wig hat,

19:34.940 --> 19:36.041
but you don't have an umbrella?

19:36.108 --> 19:37.543
- Action.

19:37.609 --> 19:38.911
- Hey, "Fiddler on the Roof."

19:38.977 --> 19:41.413
Can't you make it stop raining,
you old Jew bag?

19:41.480 --> 19:43.248
The Rothschilds
control the weather.

19:43.315 --> 19:46.118
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- This is not good.

19:46.184 --> 19:48.353
- Annie could have
offered Amy her umbrella,

19:48.420 --> 19:51.390
but a lack of courtesy
is not punishable by law.

19:51.456 --> 19:52.824
Sorry, Amy.

19:52.891 --> 19:54.393
Does anyone want
to freestyle a scenario?

19:54.459 --> 19:56.562
Thank you, Annie.
Come on up, Sheila.

19:56.628 --> 19:57.796
Here we go.

19:57.863 --> 19:59.731
- Can I borrow a stapler?

19:59.798 --> 20:01.733
Jews are cheap and ugly.

20:01.800 --> 20:04.636
- Why would you say that to me?
- Oh, here comes the whining.

20:04.703 --> 20:05.938
- Wait a minute.

20:06.004 --> 20:07.906
That's super anti-Semitic.

20:07.973 --> 20:09.841
- Fucking thank you--
oh, no, no.

20:09.908 --> 20:11.376
That's okay.
Don't worry about it.

20:11.443 --> 20:13.879
Especially you, of all people.
[laughs] I mean...

20:13.946 --> 20:15.681
Jews, are we a race?
Are we a religion?

20:15.747 --> 20:17.482
Like, who even wants
to get into it?

20:17.549 --> 20:19.151
It's nothing like what Black
people have to go through.

20:19.217 --> 20:20.552
I shouldn't--
- Amy, Amy, please.

20:20.619 --> 20:21.587
It's okay.
- No.

20:21.653 --> 20:23.555
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

20:23.622 --> 20:25.357
I'm sorry about Israel.

20:25.424 --> 20:27.059
I've never even been there,
but I just--

20:27.125 --> 20:28.961
I know I'm supposed to be
sorry about it,

20:29.027 --> 20:31.530
and I'm sorry that there
are terrorist attacks there

20:31.597 --> 20:34.466
and that nobody wants
to talk about them.

20:34.533 --> 20:35.667
I'm sorry about Bernie Madoff.

20:35.734 --> 20:37.369
I'm sorry about Bernie Sanders.
