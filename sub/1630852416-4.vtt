WEBVTT

00:09.109 --> 00:10.510
You were a wee bit
over the legal limit

00:10.543 --> 00:12.979
with your pals the other day.

00:14.280 --> 00:15.215
What're you looking at?

00:15.281 --> 00:16.282
- Huh?
- Huh?

00:17.384 --> 00:18.618
- Wayne.
- Huh?

00:18.651 --> 00:20.787
- What's good?
- Nothin'.

00:20.820 --> 00:22.455
Okay, well, what was good?

00:22.489 --> 00:25.358
Oh, darts I smoked,
and hearts I broke'd.

00:25.392 --> 00:27.227
- What?
- Nothin'.

00:27.293 --> 00:28.528
Yous hammered good, buddy?

00:28.561 --> 00:30.130
- Who, me?
- He's hammered.

00:30.163 --> 00:31.731
What's that?

00:31.798 --> 00:33.133
You get into a little
happy hour over there, bud?

00:33.166 --> 00:34.534
- I'm always happy, Katy.
- Where's Rosie?

00:34.567 --> 00:36.136
She never get out of it.

00:36.169 --> 00:38.038
Nothing beats a cat nap
betw.

00:38.071 --> 00:39.906
Couple Caesars
will do that to a gal.

00:39.973 --> 00:41.474
Some snackin' in there, too.

00:41.508 --> 00:43.309
There's some pretzels
with the Caesars.

00:43.343 --> 00:44.744
You better watch out there,
good buddy,

00:44.811 --> 00:46.413
you're gonna get
scoliosis of the liver.

00:46.479 --> 00:47.981
Nope, don't think
that was right, Dary.

00:48.014 --> 00:49.315
- Nope.
- Fine.

00:49.349 --> 00:50.483
He's gonna get
psoriasis of the liver.

00:50.517 --> 00:51.918
- Uh-uh.
- Strike two.

00:51.985 --> 00:53.219
Okay, spina bifida of the liver.

00:53.253 --> 00:54.921
- Air ball.
- Hang 'em up.

00:54.988 --> 00:56.823
Okay, serendipitous of the liver
and just leave it at that.

00:56.856 --> 00:59.659
Did yous know that there's a bar
in Moncton, New Brunswick

00:59.692 --> 01:01.828
that'll give you three
rye and cokes for nine bucks?

01:01.861 --> 01:03.263
Come off it.

01:03.329 --> 01:04.764
Yeah, it's the home of
the 3-for-9.

01:04.831 --> 01:06.666
What is this, 2003s?

01:06.699 --> 01:08.601
Says right on the sign there,
it's the home of the 3-for-9.

01:08.668 --> 01:10.837
Home of where threes are nines.

01:10.870 --> 01:12.739
- Where'd you read that?
- On the internet.

01:12.772 --> 01:14.174
Does it have to be
rye and cokes?

01:14.207 --> 01:16.276
You got a problem?

01:16.342 --> 01:18.011
- No, I just--
- You want one?

01:18.044 --> 01:19.612
Just some people
like rum and cokes

01:19.679 --> 01:21.114
better than rye and cokes.

01:21.181 --> 01:22.782
Yeah, or rum and 7's,
rye and 7's.

01:22.849 --> 01:24.851
Rye and gingers. Vodka 7's.

01:24.884 --> 01:26.352
Vodka tonic. Gin soda.

01:26.386 --> 01:28.421
Seven and tonic,
if you like a mocktail.

01:28.455 --> 01:30.690
Gin and 7's. Rum 'n' ginger.

01:30.723 --> 01:33.293
- Highballs.
- What'd you call me?

01:33.359 --> 01:36.463
An ounce of booze with
a we.

01:36.529 --> 01:38.531
If you wanna...

01:38.565 --> 01:40.133
You think they
designed the 3-for-9?

01:40.200 --> 01:42.135
Be, like, clientele
pays with a ten,

01:42.202 --> 01:43.636
and then the extra buck
would go for a tip?

01:43.703 --> 01:45.105
That's only ten percent.

01:45.138 --> 01:46.372
Yeah, I bet that is
how they designed it.

01:46.406 --> 01:48.541
Here's three highballs
for nine bucks.

01:48.575 --> 01:50.043
Clientele hands them a ten,

01:50.076 --> 01:51.778
and the extra loonie
is for the bartender.

01:51.811 --> 01:52.879
What is this cheapskate
beat-skate

01:52.912 --> 01:54.647
New Brunswick bull crap?

01:54.714 --> 01:56.382
Yeah, cost of living ain't
too highs in New Brunswick,

01:56.416 --> 01:58.218
so there's no excuse
for tippings poorly.

01:58.251 --> 01:59.719
Yeah.

01:59.752 --> 02:01.488
That's why I said
it's just a loonie.

02:01.554 --> 02:03.289
I was out there one time and I
h.

02:03.323 --> 02:05.125
- Huh?
- Was just sayin'

02:05.158 --> 02:07.327
I was out there one time and
he.

02:07.393 --> 02:08.828
- Loanie?
- Yeah, like loanie.

02:08.895 --> 02:11.297
More bass-ackwards
New Brunswick bull crap.

02:11.331 --> 02:13.233
Actually, as I recall dude
said he was from, like,

02:13.266 --> 02:14.734
the other side of
the Great Lakes.

02:14.767 --> 02:16.903
Oh, so then it'd be
a Minnesota loanie.

02:16.936 --> 02:18.805
Or a Wisconsin loanie.

02:18.838 --> 02:21.007
Can you imagine being
the cheapskate beat-skate

02:21.074 --> 02:24.110
New Brunswicker who doesn't give
?

02:25.678 --> 02:27.313
She'd say, "What're you
gonna do with that loanie?

02:27.347 --> 02:30.016
He'd say, "It's not yours
until I give it to you."

02:30.083 --> 02:31.918
She'd say, "You get your
mitts off that loanie."

02:31.951 --> 02:34.154
"Oh, you got big plans
for that loanies do yas?"

02:34.187 --> 02:35.255
"What're you gonna
do with that loanie?"

02:35.288 --> 02:36.856
"You got kids?

02:36.923 --> 02:38.358
If you did you'd know
a loanie goes a long way."

02:38.424 --> 02:40.760
Then she'd say, "I do have kids

02:40.793 --> 02:42.862
and I came a long
way for this loanie."

02:42.929 --> 02:44.597
"What're you gonna
do with that loanie?"

02:44.631 --> 02:45.932
"What I do with the loanie is
none of your beeswax."

02:45.965 --> 02:47.433
"That's my
New Brunswick loanie."

02:47.467 --> 02:50.270
"It's not even a toanie.
It's only a loanie."

02:50.303 --> 02:52.438
"It's not a toanie,
so you'll have no problem

02:52.472 --> 02:53.940
parting with the loanie."

02:53.973 --> 02:55.942
"Oh, you got big plans
for the loanie?"

02:55.975 --> 02:57.677
"What're you gonna do
with that loanie?

02:57.710 --> 02:59.546
"Take the whole family down
Disney with that loanie."

02:59.612 --> 03:01.714
- "Buy a boat with the loanie."
"

03:01.781 --> 03:03.349
"Fur coat with a loanie."

03:03.383 --> 03:05.451
"Tell me what you're
gonna do with that loanie!"

03:05.485 --> 03:07.353
Tip your server.

03:17.830 --> 03:19.899
Laundry day then, eh?

03:19.933 --> 03:21.501
Dr. Rutherford retired.

03:21.534 --> 03:23.169
- Did he really?
- Dum-diddie-doo.

03:23.203 --> 03:24.837
- He was a good guy.
- He's a good guy.

03:24.871 --> 03:27.073
- He was a great guy.
- Well, now there's a new guy.

03:27.106 --> 03:29.509
Is that what there is?

03:29.542 --> 03:31.277
You've got an appointment
to open up a file with him

03:31.344 --> 03:33.012
- this morning.
- What for?

03:33.046 --> 03:34.948
Because everyone
needs a family doctor.

03:35.014 --> 03:36.783
Oh, I know everybody
needs a family doctor,

03:36.849 --> 03:38.251
but I got chorin'
to do this mornin'.

03:38.284 --> 03:39.953
Yeah?
What about this afternoon?

03:40.019 --> 03:41.354
- Chorin'.
- This evening?

03:41.387 --> 03:44.357
- Chorin'.
- Any and every idle moment?

03:46.226 --> 03:47.860
Chores?

03:47.894 --> 03:49.596
You've got an appointment
this morning to open a file.

03:49.629 --> 03:51.431
Pitter patter.

03:51.464 --> 03:53.700
- Okay, Katy.
- Katy, okay.

03:53.733 --> 03:55.868
Maybe you oughta see
if he's got time for you, too.

03:55.902 --> 03:57.370
Figure out why you've
been allergic to clothes

03:57.403 --> 03:59.872
your whole fucking life.

03:59.906 --> 04:04.644
♪ Do you believe in me
like I believe in you? ♪

04:04.711 --> 04:05.812
Wayne!

04:05.878 --> 04:06.879
Glen.

04:08.081 --> 04:09.549
I know what you're thinking.

04:09.582 --> 04:10.717
"This guy does everything!"

04:10.750 --> 04:12.285
- Which guy?
- Me.

04:12.318 --> 04:13.820
- Well, do you?
- I would.

04:13.886 --> 04:15.288
Alright.

04:15.321 --> 04:16.623
Katy called this morning
and said that you need

04:16.656 --> 04:18.224
a little check-up,
and I said to her,

04:18.258 --> 04:20.226
"Well, we do everything
from coughs to colds

04:20.260 --> 04:21.294
to pimples on your dinkie."

04:21.327 --> 04:22.629
Oh, is that what you said?

04:22.662 --> 04:26.232
Wayne...

04:26.266 --> 04:30.970
I'm going to need
to pull your file.

04:31.004 --> 04:33.606
I think it's over here.

04:37.410 --> 04:38.778
Nope, not that one.

04:40.246 --> 04:43.750
Sometimes I like to
keep it on the bottom.

04:43.783 --> 04:45.918
There it is.

04:45.952 --> 04:48.087
Hm. Alright, Wayne,
you can take a seat.

04:48.121 --> 04:49.489
Doctor will be with you shortly.

04:49.522 --> 04:51.824
Thank you.

04:51.858 --> 04:53.926
Hey, brother.

04:53.960 --> 04:55.428
Coach, how are ya now?

04:56.629 --> 04:57.997
Not so bad.

04:58.031 --> 05:00.933
Going pretty
hard at the gym, right?

05:00.967 --> 05:02.268
Probably tell from my bod.

05:02.302 --> 05:03.770
Can confirm.

05:03.803 --> 05:05.505
I was at the gym this morning,

05:05.538 --> 05:08.007
and the owner of the gym
comes over and she says,

05:08.041 --> 05:12.178
she says to me, "Hey, I think
you're here more than I am."

05:12.211 --> 05:15.281
- Oh, is that what she said?
- Yeah, yeah.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.050
She owns the gym.

05:17.116 --> 05:18.618
Yeah, so you'd think no one
would be there more than her.

05:18.651 --> 05:19.952
- Where? At the gym?
- Yeah.

05:19.986 --> 05:23.122
Yeah. Well, she said it
not me, so...

05:23.156 --> 05:25.458
Well, there ya go.

05:25.491 --> 05:28.728
Come to think of it,
I neve,

05:28.795 --> 05:30.363
how you keep such a sweet bod?

05:30.396 --> 05:32.532
Lift with your legs,
not with your back.

05:32.565 --> 05:35.034
Where? At the gym? Why?

05:35.068 --> 05:36.703
If you don't
you'll get hemorrhoids.

05:36.736 --> 05:38.304
Big T, how are ya now?

05:38.338 --> 05:39.972
- Good, and you?
- Not so bad.

05:40.006 --> 05:42.975
- Why are ya here?
- Gettin' my tits done.

05:43.009 --> 05:46.479
Hey, been going
pretty hard at the gym.

05:46.512 --> 05:48.648
Probably tell from my bod.

05:48.681 --> 05:51.551
You here to open a new file with
the new doc, too?

05:51.584 --> 05:53.920
- No.
- Oh, why then?

05:53.986 --> 05:55.388
Got hemorrhoids.

05:55.421 --> 05:56.489
What, so you're going to
walk in there and say,

05:56.522 --> 05:57.990
"How you like them apples?"

05:58.024 --> 06:00.093
I'll say,
"You wanna see a cherry tart?"

06:00.159 --> 06:01.994
Tyson?

06:03.496 --> 06:05.064
Yous must'a been early.

06:05.098 --> 06:07.333
Well, if you're not
10 minutes early, you're late.

06:07.367 --> 06:09.035
- Doctor.
- Eh, call me doc.

06:12.338 --> 06:14.507
What do you think
his real name is?

06:14.540 --> 06:16.609
Looks like a Darren.

06:16.676 --> 06:19.679
I think he looks
like a Jim.

06:19.712 --> 06:21.681
Wow, you really do
lift a lot of weights.

06:21.714 --> 06:23.449
It ain't your
grandma's cherry cobbler.

06:23.516 --> 06:25.017
Eh, I prefer a cherry crumble,

06:25.051 --> 06:27.286
but what I see here is
more of a raspberry crisp.

06:27.353 --> 06:29.122
I'm going to write
you a script.

06:29.188 --> 06:30.523
It's an ointment. You're gonna
apply it three times a day.

06:30.556 --> 06:32.358
You can use the applicator
or your finger,

06:32.392 --> 06:34.527
but if you use your finger,
you gotta go in knuckle deep.

06:34.560 --> 06:36.763
Hey, is there such thing
as a three-knuckler?

06:36.796 --> 06:38.364
Only recreationally.

06:38.398 --> 06:39.932
Hey, when was your
last prostate exam?

06:39.966 --> 06:41.868
Need a hand in there, doc?

06:41.901 --> 06:43.136
Maybe a finger?

06:43.202 --> 06:44.871
Nope.

06:44.904 --> 06:47.540
Okay, I'll be right
out.

06:47.573 --> 06:50.042
Mm-hm. So...

06:50.076 --> 06:51.644
Not for love or money, doc.

06:51.711 --> 06:52.879
You've never had
a prostate exam?

06:52.912 --> 06:54.313
Not for all
the tea in China.

06:54.380 --> 06:55.815
A prostate exam is a standard

06:55.882 --> 06:58.050
and very important part
of any head-to-toe physical.

06:58.084 --> 07:00.319
It's my responsibility
to strongly suggest one

07:00.386 --> 07:01.888
with every new file I open.

07:01.921 --> 07:03.089
Glad I ain't opening one.

07:03.122 --> 07:04.724
Well, we're already here.
Why don't I just

07:04.757 --> 07:06.659
saunter up there and check your
Attorney General?

07:06.726 --> 07:07.994
Mm, I don't have time.

07:08.060 --> 07:09.395
You never
had one before, right?

07:09.429 --> 07:11.898
- No, but--
- Well, now's the time.

07:11.931 --> 07:15.668
Alright, don't worry.
The exam only takes a second.

07:15.735 --> 07:17.336
This is clean.

07:20.940 --> 07:22.575
Well, how are
the cherry tomatoes?

07:22.608 --> 07:24.310
You guys are here to
open a new file, right?

07:24.343 --> 07:26.312
- Just a bit of lip filler.
- I'm seri', dawg.

07:26.345 --> 07:28.815
Just pop in before the gym.
What's up, brother?

07:28.848 --> 07:31.150
Opening up a new file involves
a head-to-toe physical.

07:31.184 --> 07:32.752
What, are you saying
there's a pedicure, too, or?

07:32.785 --> 07:34.487
Guess what comes with
a head-to-toe physical.

07:34.520 --> 07:35.588
Gym membership.

07:38.758 --> 07:41.194
Now, I want to make sure
I heard that right.

07:43.129 --> 07:44.831
So, you said...

07:46.799 --> 07:49.001
-
- You mean...

07:51.370 --> 07:52.538
Wayne.
- Pardon?

07:52.605 --> 07:55.441
- The doctor will see you now.
- I'm out.

07:55.475 --> 07:56.776
Or it says Coach?

07:56.809 --> 07:58.544
- Mm-hm.
- Whoever wants to go first.

07:58.611 --> 08:00.279
Just give me a sec to disinfect.

08:00.313 --> 08:02.782
- I gotta go to the gym.
- I gotta get to chorin'.

08:02.815 --> 08:04.283
- Well, gym's more important.
-.

08:04.317 --> 08:06.319
You wanna just go?
Let's just go.

08:21.234 --> 08:22.802
- How're you now?
- Good, and you?

08:22.835 --> 08:24.437
- Not so bad.
- There you go.

08:26.739 --> 08:28.541
Gonna do some
chorin' this afternoon?

08:28.574 --> 08:32.645
Yeah. Just takin' five
before chores?

08:32.678 --> 08:35.581
Yeah. It's like,
a pretty good five.

08:35.648 --> 08:37.016
Yeah. Might, uh...

08:39.185 --> 08:41.420
Might end up takin'
a real good five here.

08:49.028 --> 08:50.930
Did you hear
Dr. Rutherford's retiring?

08:50.997 --> 08:53.332
Yeah. He was a good guy.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.201
- He's a good guy.
- He was a great guy.

08:57.370 --> 09:00.840
So, you gonna go open up
a file with the new guy?

09:00.873 --> 09:03.342
I may.

09:03.376 --> 09:05.344
That's good. Everybody should
have a family doctor.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.346
For sure.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.081
Mm-hm.

09:09.115 --> 09:11.217
They should...

09:12.385 --> 09:13.619
And you?

09:15.454 --> 09:16.856
Yeah, thought I'd go down there.

09:16.889 --> 09:17.890
Oh.

09:19.692 --> 09:22.428
- So I did.
- Did you really?

09:22.461 --> 09:24.063
Went down after 'brefakst'.

09:27.466 --> 09:32.038
So, is it true...

09:32.071 --> 09:36.142
that you get a head-to-toe
physical

09:36.208 --> 09:38.578
when you open up
a new file, or...

09:40.212 --> 09:41.581
- Can confirm.
- Alright.

09:44.483 --> 09:48.588
So, do you want to
do anything notable...

09:51.090 --> 09:53.492
...in and around
the end of 'er, or?

09:56.329 --> 09:58.931
Yeah, you could call it notable.

10:10.109 --> 10:12.044
What was it?

10:13.245 --> 10:14.680
Um...

10:16.449 --> 10:17.483
Tunneling?

10:17.516 --> 10:20.753
Oof. Oof. Oof-oof-oof.

10:24.123 --> 10:25.691
It's in the gallery, or?

10:25.758 --> 10:27.760
- Down the crawlspace.
- Alright.

10:29.462 --> 10:30.930
Well, how was that for ya?

10:33.599 --> 10:36.135
I heard that sort of thing
can.

10:39.705 --> 10:41.474
Well, how would it do that?

10:43.042 --> 10:44.944
Well...

10:44.977 --> 10:46.612
you let someone
go up there once,

10:46.646 --> 10:50.182
and it just doesn't work
anymore.

10:50.216 --> 10:52.551
Oh, like it just stops working.

10:52.618 --> 10:54.453
- Bottoms up.
- Like, instantly,

10:54.487 --> 10:57.623
or you just-- you just--

10:57.657 --> 11:00.359
like, losing power to
the dash for a wee bit?

11:00.393 --> 11:02.294
Nope, she won't turn over.

11:02.328 --> 11:04.130
And no matter
how many times you try.

11:04.163 --> 11:06.332
- Nope, won't even spark.
- That right?

11:07.833 --> 11:09.001
Is that right?

11:13.305 --> 11:16.042
So, did you...

11:16.075 --> 11:18.644
end up opening, uh...

11:18.678 --> 11:21.180
a new file there, or?

11:24.183 --> 11:25.184
Well--

11:26.919 --> 11:28.320
How's the garburator, doc?

11:28.354 --> 11:29.822
Well, it's good for me,
but I think your dentist

11:29.855 --> 11:31.924
- would tell you to floss.
- Yeah, guess I could

11:31.991 --> 11:33.893
try out those white strips
I got for Christmas.

11:33.926 --> 11:35.327
Well, alright, Daryl.
Take your pants down.

11:35.361 --> 11:37.496
Need a hand in there, doc?

11:37.530 --> 11:40.166
- Maybe a finger?
- Nope.

11:40.199 --> 11:41.667
Okay, I'll be right
out.

11:41.701 --> 11:44.770
Mm-hm. So...

11:44.837 --> 11:47.006
Just take my pants down?

11:47.039 --> 11:48.240
Yeah, take your pants down.

11:48.274 --> 11:49.942
I'll do your
biannual prostate exam,

11:50.009 --> 11:52.678
and then we'll get you back
to that...

11:52.712 --> 11:54.580
...barn it smells like
you just came from.

11:54.613 --> 11:56.248
Well, I just,
I never had one before.

11:56.282 --> 11:58.350
Wait, Dr. Rutherford never
met your sheriff's deputy?

11:58.384 --> 12:00.086
- Nope.
- Your Hochelaga-Maisonneuve.

12:00.119 --> 12:01.921
- Nope.
- Went outsi?

12:01.954 --> 12:03.255
Never.

12:03.289 --> 12:04.957
No quick Uncle Sam?

12:05.024 --> 12:07.960
- Uh-uh..
- Huh.

12:08.027 --> 12:09.428
Never touched the grand gland,
eh?

12:09.462 --> 12:12.298
Well, we're here now,
so why don't we just

12:12.364 --> 12:15.034
dance on up there
and check out Bobcaygeon?

12:15.067 --> 12:17.369
I, just-- maybe I don't
have time right now.

12:17.403 --> 12:18.637
You never had one before, right?

12:18.704 --> 12:19.872
Well, no, but--

12:19.905 --> 12:22.074
Then now is the time.
Don't worry.

12:23.809 --> 12:26.245
The exam only takes a second.

12:27.646 --> 12:28.981
Oh, I should put on my glove.

12:31.584 --> 12:34.053
And then straight
up the channel?

12:34.086 --> 12:35.321
Oh, no, I pumped the brakes.

12:35.387 --> 12:37.389
- Did you really?
- Yep.

12:37.423 --> 12:39.725
How?

12:39.759 --> 12:43.462
I said I had to poo.

12:43.496 --> 12:45.731
You said you had to poo.

12:45.765 --> 12:50.002
Yeah. I said I'd never had
to.

12:50.069 --> 12:53.139
Right then and there.

12:53.172 --> 12:56.909
So, took my pants back up,
said I had to poo.

12:56.942 --> 12:58.744
No, but I thought you said
you had to poo to get out of

12:58.778 --> 13:00.579
taking your pants down.

13:00.613 --> 13:04.083
No, I got the idea
for saying I had to poo

13:04.116 --> 13:06.352
after I had took my pants down.

13:06.418 --> 13:08.754
Yeah, but--

13:08.788 --> 13:10.856
--you were pert'
around the bases.

13:10.923 --> 13:12.258
Yeah.

13:12.291 --> 13:14.593
You shoulda just
let him slide into home.

13:14.627 --> 13:16.929
- Yeah.
- Oh, Dary. I feel you.

13:16.962 --> 13:18.497
That's going to be the one
that got away, good buddy.

13:18.531 --> 13:21.100
- Yeah, but--
- No but...

13:21.133 --> 13:22.434
It's just...

13:25.538 --> 13:28.941
Have you-- You know how you have
to spread your butt cheeks

13:28.974 --> 13:30.609
sometimes 'cause
you're going to--

13:30.643 --> 13:32.778
Sure, sure.

13:32.812 --> 13:35.514
Well, have you ever
had another man

13:35.548 --> 13:38.117
spread your butt cheeks for ya?

13:40.719 --> 13:42.388
Well, no.

13:42.454 --> 13:46.358
Well, it's a bit... queer.

13:46.392 --> 13:48.460
I'll let you have that one.

13:48.494 --> 13:51.797
This man wanted to spread
my butt cheeks wide open

13:51.831 --> 13:54.200
and just--

13:54.233 --> 13:56.135
Yeah, that's--
that's why Tyson said.

13:56.168 --> 13:58.137
He said...

13:59.805 --> 14:02.308
And that was all just
a bit too much for you then?

14:02.341 --> 14:05.211
Yeah, so I took my pants up
and hit eject on the...

14:06.812 --> 14:09.648
But you're right at
the doorstep of the...

14:11.350 --> 14:14.420
But I couldn't, you know...

14:14.486 --> 14:18.224
But couldn't you just...

14:18.257 --> 14:19.825
Hey.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.260
Whistle while you work?

14:21.327 --> 14:22.895
Have you no fucking garments?

14:22.928 --> 14:23.929
The clinic called.

14:23.996 --> 14:24.930
'Kay.

14:24.997 --> 14:27.566
Why'd you miss
your appointment?

14:27.600 --> 14:29.501
- Glen tattled?!
- I never said it was Glen.

14:29.535 --> 14:31.337
Why'd you miss your appointment?

14:31.370 --> 14:33.439
Well, I'm not gonna tell you
un.

14:33.505 --> 14:34.940
Doesn't matter who tattled.

14:35.007 --> 14:36.508
You're not s'posed to tattle,
Katy!

14:36.542 --> 14:38.177
Yet here you are
telling me to tattle.

14:38.210 --> 14:40.779
You know, I go through
the trouble of making you

14:40.846 --> 14:42.915
that appointment, and then you
go being ignorant of my time?

14:42.948 --> 14:45.084
It wasn't on fucking purpose!

14:45.117 --> 14:47.953
Glen says that if you leave
ri.

14:48.020 --> 14:49.688
Oh, Glen said that, did he?

14:49.722 --> 14:51.190
Well, guess you just shot
you.

14:51.223 --> 14:52.191
Go.

14:52.224 --> 14:53.959
No!

14:54.026 --> 14:56.395
Go! Scooch your bum.

15:08.908 --> 15:10.709
Daryl! Wayne!

15:10.743 --> 15:12.044
Glen.

15:12.077 --> 15:13.779
You twos left in
a hurry this morning.

15:13.812 --> 15:16.448
Did you forget to
say goodbye to someone?

15:16.482 --> 15:17.883
I had to poo.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.885
Thank you for your honesty,
Daryl. Wayne?

15:19.919 --> 15:21.553
I had a spin class.

15:21.587 --> 15:22.888
You had a spin class?

15:22.922 --> 15:24.723
Monday, Wednesday,
and twice on Friday.

15:24.757 --> 15:26.725
I'll have to verify that.
Let me see your calves.

15:26.759 --> 15:28.627
Look, can the doc
still fit us in or no?

15:28.661 --> 15:31.330
I'll have to
verify that also.

15:31.397 --> 15:33.599
Let me pull your files.

15:36.902 --> 15:38.103
Okay. Yeah.

15:40.406 --> 15:42.508
Go ahead and take a seat.

15:52.117 --> 15:53.252
How're ya now?

15:53.285 --> 15:55.487
- Hey, brother.
- Not so bad.

15:55.521 --> 15:57.423
Hey, remember when I was
telling you I was going

15:57.456 --> 15:59.992
pretty hard at the gym?
Probably tell from my bod.

16:00.025 --> 16:01.160
Well, I hope
you're not down there

16:01.193 --> 16:02.594
taking pictures of yourself.

16:02.628 --> 16:05.097
Eh, deadlifting plates.

16:05.130 --> 16:06.598
So, I bend over
for the Olympic bar

16:06.632 --> 16:08.167
and give it a tug
with my back like you said.

16:08.200 --> 16:09.601
No, you should lift with
your legs, not your back.

16:09.635 --> 16:11.537
Now I got the grapes of wrath,
like Tyson.

16:11.603 --> 16:12.538
What?

16:12.604 --> 16:13.973
I got little fish eggs, brother.

16:14.006 --> 16:17.042
- Got a little 'tapico'.
- Ah, a little trouser rub.

16:17.109 --> 16:18.610
A little backyard caviar there.

16:18.644 --> 16:20.846
I asked Tyson if I could
borrow his ointment, right?

16:20.879 --> 16:25.217
For my cranberries,
and he thought that was gay.

16:25.284 --> 16:27.519
I'll let him have that one.

16:27.553 --> 16:30.022
Just a little ill at ease that
the doctor's gonna want to--

16:30.055 --> 16:31.023
Dance on up there?

16:31.056 --> 16:32.057
Well, he's in the neighbourhood.

16:32.124 --> 16:33.192
That'll want a buggy.

16:33.225 --> 16:34.626
Did you ever have one, Coach?

16:34.660 --> 16:36.895
A body fat test?
Yeah, ev.

16:36.962 --> 16:38.464
Holy fuck.

16:38.497 --> 16:39.865
Even though they look at my bod,
they still do it.

16:39.898 --> 16:43.202
No, a...

16:43.235 --> 16:45.571
Just to confirm you mean a...

16:45.637 --> 16:49.208
Can confirm he means a...

16:49.241 --> 16:50.709
No. You?

16:50.743 --> 16:52.077
No.

16:52.144 --> 16:53.212
You haven't either,
hey, brother?

16:53.245 --> 16:54.813
Why haven't you had one?

16:54.847 --> 16:56.815
- I'm scared.
- What for?

16:56.849 --> 16:59.485
I've never had a desire
to put anything up my butt.

16:59.518 --> 17:01.653
So, let's operate
on the assumption

17:01.687 --> 17:03.255
I'm not going to love it.

17:03.322 --> 17:04.890
You know,
like I love going to the gym.

17:04.923 --> 17:06.992
Yeah, it'd be a little
bit cramped up there.

17:07.026 --> 17:09.161
So, what if the doc
traipses up there,

17:09.194 --> 17:11.830
and it, you know,
he sees a reason to

17:11.864 --> 17:13.432
traipse up there again?

17:13.499 --> 17:14.833
Oh...

17:14.867 --> 17:16.769
You know, one traipse
could lead to many traipses.

17:16.835 --> 17:19.571
- Yeah, I guess it could.
- A.

17:19.605 --> 17:21.774
So, it's an ignorance
is bliss type thing.

17:21.840 --> 17:23.175
I never even thought about that.

17:23.208 --> 17:25.677
Well, what keep
you from getting...

17:25.711 --> 17:27.613
- Betwixt?
- Yeah.

17:27.679 --> 17:30.949
Well, I heard that it could
break your heterosexuality.

17:31.016 --> 17:32.351
I think if something
like that's going to break

17:32.384 --> 17:33.852
your heterosexuality it was

17:33.886 --> 17:35.621
- already broken.
- Maybe already broken.

17:35.687 --> 17:37.356
- Yeah, that was my initial...
- I've had some time to think

17:37.389 --> 17:38.857
- ...thinking that I came up
- about it, that's the

17:38.891 --> 17:40.259
- ...with as well.
- concl.

17:40.292 --> 17:44.029
Hey, why are you so hesitant,
Wayne?

17:44.063 --> 17:45.764
Well, I'm a bit ashamed
of myself here, fellas.

17:45.798 --> 17:48.634
- What's the scoop, good buddy?
- Lay it on us, brother.

17:48.700 --> 17:50.536
I hate change.

17:50.569 --> 17:52.104
That seems like a slow death.

17:52.137 --> 17:55.641
You know what, your whole life,
come into the doc,

17:55.707 --> 17:57.543
shines a light in your eyes,
looks in your mouth,

17:57.576 --> 17:59.211
listens to your heart.

17:59.244 --> 18:01.647
And now, all of a sudden,

18:01.713 --> 18:04.883
they want to put
their finger up your ass.

18:04.917 --> 18:07.052
Fellas, the whole thing just
makes me want to go to bed.

18:07.086 --> 18:09.321
- How're ya now?
- Good, and you?

18:09.388 --> 18:11.723
- Not so bad.
- He got .

18:11.757 --> 18:13.725
- I have never--
- He go.

18:13.759 --> 18:15.727
I've never run from
anything in my life.

18:15.761 --> 18:17.963
What's that got to do with
your blood oranges, brother?

18:17.996 --> 18:19.565
Can't live with myself.

18:19.598 --> 18:21.567
Ran out of the guy's office
over a little oil check.

18:21.600 --> 18:23.402
- It's embarrassing.
- It's not.

18:23.435 --> 18:25.838
- No, I did it, too.
- That makes it even worse.

18:25.904 --> 18:28.240
You want to know what?

18:28.273 --> 18:30.175
We all scrambled.

18:30.242 --> 18:32.311
So, maybe it's not
that embarrassing.

18:32.344 --> 18:34.079
My pants were still down
when I started running.

18:34.113 --> 18:35.514
- Did you trip?
- Yup.

18:35.581 --> 18:37.349
-
- That's fucking embarrassing.

18:37.416 --> 18:38.917
That's a bit embarrassing, so.

18:38.951 --> 18:40.419
Well, well, well.

18:40.452 --> 18:42.855
Here's a bunch
of familiar faces.

18:42.921 --> 18:44.256
I'll take you in
no particular order.

18:44.289 --> 18:47.326
Just give me a sec
to disinfect.

18:47.359 --> 18:50.596
Hey, 'sup pink dicks.

18:50.629 --> 18:52.498
Hey, Tanis.

18:52.531 --> 18:53.932
Just came from the gym.

18:53.966 --> 18:56.168
Doesn't count unless you
tell everyone then, eh?

18:56.201 --> 18:57.603
You look good, Coach.

18:57.636 --> 18:59.538
It's the gym,
I just got back from it.

18:59.605 --> 19:02.508
Doesn't count unless you tell
e?

19:02.541 --> 19:06.211
You're like a drunk seven?

19:06.278 --> 19:08.780
Really?

19:08.814 --> 19:11.049
Daryl, what are
you doing here?

19:11.116 --> 19:13.018
Did you put a chicken bone
up your nose again?

19:13.051 --> 19:14.853
I was told you're not
s'posed to ask people that.

19:14.887 --> 19:16.955
Coach, if you're here to get
a referral to talk to a shrink

19:16.989 --> 19:19.224
about your dead wife,
it's good. It's time.

19:19.291 --> 19:22.027
Tyson, you can't be helped.

19:22.060 --> 19:23.462
- What's up, boo?
- How're you now?

19:23.495 --> 19:24.897
- Gettin' your tits done?
- Not so bad.

19:24.963 --> 19:26.365
Seriously, what up?

19:26.398 --> 19:28.133
Well, we're all getting
our prostates checked.

19:28.167 --> 19:29.401
Well, we're s'posed to.

19:29.468 --> 19:31.136
What do you mean
you're s'posed to?

19:31.170 --> 19:32.905
- Well, we're--
- Scared.

19:32.971 --> 19:35.140
- Skittish.
- Tired.

19:35.174 --> 19:37.543
Yeah, it's just none of us have
.

19:37.576 --> 19:39.811
Well, what's a prostate?
Do I have one?

19:39.845 --> 19:41.313
In women I'm told
it's the G-spot.

19:41.346 --> 19:42.648
Guys have a G-spot?

19:42.681 --> 19:44.383
- No.
- Well, I'm told that they do.

19:44.416 --> 19:45.918
Why wouldn't you want
to get that checked?

19:45.984 --> 19:47.819
Boom.

19:47.853 --> 19:49.154
Okay, so am I going
to have to Google this?

19:49.188 --> 19:50.489
What the fuck is a--

19:59.998 --> 20:02.768
'Kay. So, what's he put
up there?

20:02.834 --> 20:04.836
The fuck you mean what
does he put up there, Tanis?

20:04.870 --> 20:07.739
Well, what's the apparatus
called that he puts up there?

20:07.773 --> 20:08.740
- A digit.
- Huh?

20:08.774 --> 20:09.741
- A pointer.
- Huh?

20:09.775 --> 20:10.842
- A feeler.
- What?

20:10.876 --> 20:12.010
- A finger.
- A finger?

20:12.044 --> 20:14.680
Yes, a fin-- phalange.

20:14.713 --> 20:16.248
- And then what?
- Then what?

20:16.281 --> 20:18.350
And then what else
does he put up there?

20:18.383 --> 20:20.452
- It's a, uh--
- Like, it's just his--

20:20.519 --> 20:23.021
- Tactile.
- For how long?

20:23.055 --> 20:27.025
He said the exam
is over in seconds.

20:27.059 --> 20:28.694
-
- You pussies.

20:28.727 --> 20:30.028
- What?
- You pussies.

20:30.062 --> 20:31.129
What?!

20:31.196 --> 20:32.965
You fucking pussies!

20:33.031 --> 20:34.866
That's derogatory.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.201
Try getting a pap smear.

20:36.235 --> 20:37.803
- What's that?
- What's that?

20:37.869 --> 20:39.805
It's like getting fingered
but with salad tongs.

20:39.871 --> 20:41.440
Holy fuck!

20:41.473 --> 20:44.109
- Alright, I need a volunteer.
- Why?

20:44.142 --> 20:45.611
Daryl, you just volunteered
yourself, you lucky man.

20:45.644 --> 20:47.546
Get over here.

20:50.315 --> 20:52.150
Get on your back.

20:53.252 --> 20:55.487
That's your stomach, idiot.

20:57.990 --> 21:00.459
These are stirrups
for your feet.

21:00.492 --> 21:02.160
Now, put your feet
in the stirrups.

21:02.227 --> 21:05.964
And we're going to pretend
lik.

21:05.998 --> 21:07.899
- Is his mitt right out?
- Oh, it's right out.

21:07.933 --> 21:09.901
It's getting free air
conditioning and shit.

21:09.935 --> 21:11.637
I get that at the gym.

21:11.670 --> 21:13.572
I'm the doctor,
and I'm going to put my face

21:13.605 --> 21:15.507
right up in his mitt.

21:15.574 --> 21:17.342
You put your face
right in his mitt?

21:17.409 --> 21:18.844
Can confirm,
and it's the only time

21:18.910 --> 21:20.412
it's not aggressively welcomed.

21:20.445 --> 21:22.247
Boy, you're really in
his mitt there, Tanis.

21:22.281 --> 21:23.582
Not yet.

21:23.615 --> 21:24.750
Now, you're going
to want to scooch.

21:24.783 --> 21:25.917
Why?

21:25.951 --> 21:27.152
'Cause it's a pap smear, idiot.

21:27.185 --> 21:29.254
- More.
- More?

21:29.288 --> 21:31.423
More. More!

21:31.456 --> 21:33.592
I think that's gone far enough!

21:33.625 --> 21:37.262
Okay, now, we're going
to insert the speculum.

21:37.296 --> 21:39.531
Ooh, speculum was
my nickname in high school.

21:39.598 --> 21:41.433
- Oh!
- How could I help?

21:41.466 --> 21:43.535
- Why thank you, nurse.
- What's a speculum?

21:43.602 --> 21:45.103
You know what
the jaws of life are?

21:45.137 --> 21:48.273
Yeah, it's what a fireman
uses to pry a survivor

21:48.307 --> 21:50.942
out of an automobile car,
you know, in an accident...

21:50.976 --> 21:52.344
After an accident.

21:52.377 --> 21:53.779
It's like that,
but for your mitt.

21:53.812 --> 21:55.547
What?!

21:55.614 --> 21:58.617
Now, nurse. Inserting.

21:58.650 --> 22:01.286
Inserti.

22:01.320 --> 22:04.289
They used to keep that thing ice
.

22:04.323 --> 22:08.226
And alley-oop. There.

22:08.293 --> 22:11.697
Now that the speculum is
inside of Daryl's mitt--

22:11.730 --> 22:13.465
- Thank you, nurse.
- My a.

22:13.498 --> 22:15.901
Now, I'm going to take
this cone-shaped brush,

22:15.967 --> 22:18.036
and this teeny-tiny
plastic spatula,

22:18.070 --> 22:20.706
and I'm gonna scrape Daryl's
cervix

22:20.739 --> 22:24.476
like I'm scraping yogurt out
from the inside of a cup.

22:24.509 --> 22:26.812
- Not his cervix!
- What's that?

22:26.845 --> 22:28.647
Do I have one of those?

22:28.680 --> 22:30.148
It's, like, inside your mitt.
That's all you need to know.

22:30.182 --> 22:31.416
And scraping,
scraping, scraping.

22:31.483 --> 22:32.984
Ooh, such fine work, doctor.

22:33.018 --> 22:37.422
Scraping, scraping,
scraping.

22:37.489 --> 22:39.925
You really have
to get it all.

22:39.991 --> 22:42.761
And I'm scraping Daryl's mitt.

22:42.828 --> 22:44.496
Doctor, little thought here.

22:44.529 --> 22:46.164
Since we're already
in the neighbourhood,

22:46.198 --> 22:47.933
what if we bebop downstairs
and check out his

22:47.999 --> 22:49.735
- Lukewarm Steve Ass-tin?
- Mm.

22:49.768 --> 22:53.905
And as much as I would love to
keep scraping Daryl's mitt,

22:53.939 --> 22:55.607
he's in his barn clothes.

22:55.674 --> 22:56.675
Oof.

22:57.776 --> 23:00.679
- May I get up?
- You may.

23:00.712 --> 23:03.181
Now, think about that the next
time you want to cry about

23:03.215 --> 23:05.183
a finger up your ass
for a few seconds.

23:05.217 --> 23:06.852
For many, it's a treat.

23:06.885 --> 23:08.854
Put your mitt away, pussy.

23:08.887 --> 23:10.689
Thanks, nurse.

24:58.129 --> 25:00.699
It's a bit like
taking a shit but on rewind.

25:00.732 --> 25:02.234
That's a mental picture.

25:02.300 --> 25:04.369
Well, it's a conversation
piece is what it is.

25:04.402 --> 25:06.137
It's a conversation piece.

isn't the end of the world.

Talk to me when
you get daggered.

25:09.674 --> 25:12.077
- How far up does he go?
- I'd say about an inch.

25:12.143 --> 25:14.646
I'd say it's more like two.

25:14.679 --> 25:17.849
Oh, it's not two inches.
I've seen two inches.

25:19.251 --> 25:21.319
And it's not two inches.

25:21.353 --> 25:22.654
It's a bit queer having a man

25:22.687 --> 25:23.822
spread your
butt cheeks for you, eh?

25:23.855 --> 25:24.990
That's exactly what I said.

25:25.023 --> 25:26.324
I said it's a bit queer.

25:26.358 --> 25:28.059

- Mm.

25:28.093 --> 25:29.494

25:29.528 --> 25:32.063
Is your heterosexuality intact?

25:32.097 --> 25:34.065
Puppers?

25:34.099 --> 25:36.701
- Please and thank you.
- Please and thank you.

25:39.037 --> 25:40.839
She's fully operational.

25:40.872 --> 25:42.240
Fully operational then, eh?

25:42.274 --> 25:43.842
She's alive.

25:43.875 --> 25:45.777
Well, Coach, how's she
go up there? She all gravy?

25:45.844 --> 25:49.281
Well, I got a couple of
strawberries in the rhubarb,

25:49.347 --> 25:51.349
but other than that...

25:51.383 --> 25:53.685
- Huh?
- Hunky dory.

25:53.718 --> 25:55.186
It wasn't all that bad.

25:55.220 --> 25:58.690
Well, that's the thing,
it's not bad, it's just new.

25:58.723 --> 26:02.127
It's a--
It's a new part of life.

26:02.193 --> 26:04.195
