03:07.787 --> 03:08.988
{\an5}Oh, yeah.

03:07.787 --> 03:08.988
(laughter)

03:09.055 --> 03:11.224
We have got
a lot to dive into tonight.

03:11.291 --> 03:12.492
{\an8}Now, for those of you
on social media,

03:12.559 --> 03:14.460
{\an8}we want you to weigh in
on all the drama,

03:14.527 --> 03:16.529
{\an8}so, guys,
let's get this thing moving.

03:16.596 --> 03:18.798
Like most couples,
Lyrica and A1 were aware

03:18.865 --> 03:22.168
that marriage is not always
a calm walk in the park.

03:22.235 --> 03:23.970
But the relationship
was put to the test

03:24.037 --> 03:25.505
when rumors began to swirl

03:25.572 --> 03:28.942
that Lyrica may have taken
a wild Safaree ride.

03:29.008 --> 03:30.777
{\an6}Whoa...

03:29.008 --> 03:30.777
Let's see what happened--

03:30.843 --> 03:32.679
{\an5}Who's coming up
with this stuff?

03:30.843 --> 03:32.679
--when A1 went hunting
for answers.

03:32.745 --> 03:34.480
Look how he did that.

03:34.547 --> 03:37.083
What's up with you
and Safaree?

03:37.150 --> 03:39.519
{\an8}You was trying
to (bleep) him.

03:39.586 --> 03:41.487
{\an7}(laughing)

03:41.554 --> 03:42.956
{\an8}Let me see your phone.

03:43.022 --> 03:46.125
{\an8}Let me see it.

03:46.192 --> 03:48.928
{\an8}So why is it empty?

03:48.995 --> 03:51.230
{\an7}I don't keep
all my text messages.

03:51.297 --> 03:53.333
{\an8}Everybody knows
Safaree is a flirt.

03:53.399 --> 03:55.268
{\an8}He'll be like,
"Miss you, Lyra."

03:55.335 --> 03:57.503
{\an8}If you allow that to go down,

03:57.570 --> 03:59.572
{\an7}that may have
looked inappropriate

03:59.639 --> 04:01.140
{\an8}to somebody looking on.

04:01.207 --> 04:03.343
{\an8}But my thing is, like,
why is she even doing--

04:03.409 --> 04:04.577
{\an8}And didn't you tell me once

04:04.644 --> 04:06.746
{\an7}he sent you a picture
that was inappropriate?

04:06.813 --> 04:08.047
{\an8}What's good?

04:08.114 --> 04:10.016
{\an7}(bleep) you doing
texting my wife, bro?

04:10.083 --> 04:11.584
{\an8}(bleep) like me.
She like me too.

04:11.651 --> 04:13.186
{\an8}(bleep) like you?

04:11.651 --> 04:13.186
{\an8}(bleep), it is what it is.

04:13.252 --> 04:14.320
{\an7}(bleep)

04:14.387 --> 04:16.122
{\an8}A1 and Lyrica
got back together.

04:16.189 --> 04:17.656
{\an8}She admitted it, fam.

04:17.724 --> 04:19.858
{\an7}I didn't mean for it
to happen, it's just...

04:19.926 --> 04:21.961
{\an8}we be talking, "Hey, what's up?
I want you to get on this song,"

04:22.028 --> 04:25.098
{\an8}and then...

04:22.028 --> 04:25.098
{\an8}Why did you do that?

04:25.164 --> 04:27.367
{\an8}Lyrica really didn't
admit it,

04:27.433 --> 04:29.469
{\an8}but I just needed
to know for myself.

04:29.535 --> 04:33.172
{\an8}The homie Safaree told me
that he had sex with Lyrica.

04:33.239 --> 04:34.907
{\an8}Oh!

04:33.239 --> 04:34.907
{\an7}So...

04:34.974 --> 04:37.644
{\an7}Y'all, y'all,
y'all fix everyth...

04:37.710 --> 04:41.347
{\an8}♪♪

04:41.414 --> 04:42.882
{\an8}(audience exclaiming)

04:42.949 --> 04:44.250
{\an8}(Nina)
Safaree...

04:44.317 --> 04:48.321
did you sleep with Lyrica,
yes or no?

04:48.388 --> 04:51.724
Ab... solutely... not.

04:51.791 --> 04:53.159
{\an5}(Nina)
Okay.

04:51.791 --> 04:53.159
(Lyrica G.)
Wonderful.

04:53.226 --> 04:55.194
Why did it take you
so long to say that?

04:55.261 --> 04:56.729
You should have
just said "No."

04:56.796 --> 04:59.499
Because first of all,
I wanna say, Ray J is a liar.

04:59.565 --> 05:01.167
{\an5}(audience oohing)

04:59.565 --> 05:01.167
Ray started this whole thing

05:01.234 --> 05:04.470
by being very mixy and
misleading and talking to me.

05:04.537 --> 05:06.639
{\an4}(Lyrica G.)
No, K. started it.

05:04.537 --> 05:06.639
And, and...

05:06.706 --> 05:08.441
{\an5}(Kimberly)
I said it.

05:06.706 --> 05:08.441
Kimberly...

05:08.508 --> 05:10.343
{\an5}Something happened---

05:08.508 --> 05:10.343
No, but Ray,
Ray said the whole sex thing.

05:10.410 --> 05:12.211
{\an5}(Nina)
So this is, this is what
I wanna clear up.

05:12.278 --> 05:13.646
You're saying
you really did hear this.

05:13.713 --> 05:15.148
You heard it from Safaree.

05:15.214 --> 05:16.616
And, and I apologize
to my friend--

05:16.683 --> 05:18.151
{\an5}For bringing it up.

05:16.683 --> 05:18.151
For saying something.

05:18.217 --> 05:21.721
'Cause I coulda kept on going to
her of, on numerous weed jokes.

05:21.788 --> 05:26.092
{\an5}(bleeping) liar.

05:21.788 --> 05:26.092
Quit pointing your finger,
'cause I'm the real goon, bitch.

05:26.159 --> 05:27.694
{\an5}Bitch, I'm not scared of you.

05:26.159 --> 05:27.694
But I'm done.

05:27.760 --> 05:29.228
You wished a miscarriage on me

05:29.295 --> 05:32.198
'cause you wanted Idris Elba's
baby so bad, baby.

05:32.265 --> 05:33.633
I want to have my baby too.

05:33.700 --> 05:34.701
{\an5}Unh! Unh! Ooh...

05:33.700 --> 05:34.701
I'm fine.

05:34.767 --> 05:35.902
{\an5}Ooh...

05:34.767 --> 05:35.902
(Nina)
Okay.

05:35.968 --> 05:37.670
{\an5}I'm fine.
Can you be quiet
for a second?

05:37.737 --> 05:38.938
When you (bleep) have it...

05:39.005 --> 05:40.406
(talking over each other,
bleeping)

05:40.473 --> 05:41.841
You don't know how to shut
the (bleep) up, dentures.

05:41.908 --> 05:43.576
{\an1}You don't know how to
shut the (bleep) up, bitch.

05:43.643 --> 05:45.878
K. Michelle, please don't
keep talking to her.

05:45.945 --> 05:47.747
Please,
she's seven months pregnant!

05:47.814 --> 05:48.848
Kimberly, we gotta stop.

05:48.915 --> 05:50.249
You're gonna have to leave.

05:50.316 --> 05:51.751
See y'all later.
The (bleep).

05:51.818 --> 05:53.052
I'ma let you respond.

05:53.119 --> 05:54.821
We're, we're letting her breathe
for a second.

05:54.887 --> 05:57.056
{\an5}We're gonna have her go.

05:54.887 --> 05:57.056
All right.

05:57.123 --> 05:59.025
Don't want you to have to scream
and yell... Lyrica, please...

05:59.092 --> 06:00.526
take your opportunity to respond

06:00.593 --> 06:01.894
{\an5}to what was being said.

06:00.593 --> 06:01.894
(Kimberly whooping)

06:01.961 --> 06:05.765
All I do know is Safaree
just spoke his truth on me

06:05.832 --> 06:07.266
and that's all I have to
say about it.

06:07.333 --> 06:08.768
When it comes to that bitch,

06:08.835 --> 06:11.070
she's a fake-ass bitch
and that's that.

06:11.137 --> 06:13.773
Lyrica G.
wants be my friend so bad.

06:13.840 --> 06:16.008
She wanna fight, she gotta
defend her daughter,

06:16.075 --> 06:17.376
but she wanna be my friend.

06:17.443 --> 06:18.678
I wanna go back,

06:18.745 --> 06:20.113
because we still have
some things to clear up,

06:20.179 --> 06:21.447
and I do wanna talk to A1,

06:21.514 --> 06:22.815
so when you heard
about the rumor

06:22.882 --> 06:24.650
and you confronted your wife,

06:24.717 --> 06:26.919
were you unhappy with the way
she initially responded?

06:26.986 --> 06:29.288
{\an5}I don't remember.

06:26.986 --> 06:29.288
You don't remember?

06:29.355 --> 06:30.923
{\an5}(Lyrica laughing)

06:29.355 --> 06:30.923
When, when you,

06:30.990 --> 06:33.559
when you asked her about it,
and the phone?

06:33.626 --> 06:35.161
(laughter)

06:35.228 --> 06:36.562
I don't recall.

06:36.629 --> 06:38.498
{\an5}You don't recall.

06:36.629 --> 06:38.498
(laughter)

06:38.564 --> 06:39.799
Okay.

06:39.866 --> 06:40.967
You guys are on the show

06:41.033 --> 06:42.135
and you show your life
on the show,

06:42.201 --> 06:43.336
and that's why you're
at the reunion,

06:43.402 --> 06:44.804
to respond
to what everybody's seen.

06:44.871 --> 06:47.173
I feel like
we've given the fans

06:47.240 --> 06:48.541
that answers
that they're asking for.

06:48.608 --> 06:49.909
I know I'm ready
to move on from this.

06:49.976 --> 06:51.410
{\an5}This is just, like--

06:49.976 --> 06:51.410
Well, I tried to move on,

06:51.477 --> 06:52.779
because I wanted to talk
to you and A1,

06:52.845 --> 06:54.413
but you guys are saying
you don't recall.

06:54.480 --> 06:56.716
{\an5}(Lyrica)
At the end of the day,
that's my husband

06:56.783 --> 06:58.451
and I'ma have his back
no matter what.

06:58.518 --> 07:01.087
Lyrica G., you said at the
sit-down with your daughter,

07:01.154 --> 07:02.922
"I thought you told me
he sent you a photo."

07:02.989 --> 07:04.290
I never said "photo."

07:04.357 --> 07:06.626
I said
"something inappropriate."

07:06.692 --> 07:08.294
And I definitely didn't say
or tell nobody

07:08.361 --> 07:11.564
that I sent Lyrica no...
no johnson picture or video.

07:11.631 --> 07:13.065
{\an1}So why is she making
that (bleep)--

07:13.132 --> 07:14.600
{\an5}(Nina)
You're saying
that didn't go to Lyrica.

07:14.667 --> 07:16.702
No. I really don't know
where it came from.

07:16.769 --> 07:18.337
She's saying she heard it
from her daughter,

07:18.404 --> 07:20.173
that you sent her
something inappropriate.

07:20.239 --> 07:21.841
{\an5}Shut your skinny ass up.

07:20.239 --> 07:21.841
Don't do that.

07:21.908 --> 07:23.776
Don't do that, Moniece.

07:23.843 --> 07:25.711
I'm not gonna disrespect
nobody's mama.

07:25.778 --> 07:27.280
{\an5}No, bitch.

07:25.778 --> 07:27.280
(voices overlapping)

07:27.346 --> 07:28.748
That's not where she
heard it from, bitch.

07:28.815 --> 07:30.049
What did you say?

07:30.116 --> 07:31.818
{\an5}You said my marriage was fake--

07:30.116 --> 07:31.818
Bitch, I did.

07:31.884 --> 07:33.386
{\an4}I said your marriage
was fake, ho!

07:31.884 --> 07:33.386
--you fake-ass bitch!

07:33.452 --> 07:34.520
{\an5}You fake-ass bitch!

07:33.452 --> 07:34.520
You called me!

07:34.587 --> 07:35.655
You said it,
and if I was there,

07:35.721 --> 07:36.823
I would (bleep) you up!

07:36.889 --> 07:38.691
{\an1}You even said it,
you dumb-ass bitch!

07:38.758 --> 07:40.493
{\an5}(bleep) you.

07:38.758 --> 07:40.493
{\an1}I said what the (bleep)
I said.

07:40.560 --> 07:42.795
{\an5}And I'll beat your ass!

07:40.560 --> 07:42.795
{\an1}And you didn't say
anything else?

07:42.862 --> 07:45.231
(audience jeering,
voices overlapping)

07:45.298 --> 07:47.033
{\an5}Lyrica...

07:45.298 --> 07:47.033
Oh, my God.

07:47.099 --> 07:48.434
I'm over this (bleep).

07:48.501 --> 07:50.203
She's pregnant, Moniece!

07:50.269 --> 07:51.838
{\an5}And she's pregnant,
and so what?

07:50.269 --> 07:51.838
Time to heal, Moniece.

07:51.904 --> 07:53.940
{\an5}(audience oohing)

07:51.904 --> 07:53.940
But she's pregnant.
Why you tripping on her?

07:54.006 --> 07:55.842
{\an5}She's pregnant!

07:54.006 --> 07:55.842
She's not even here
to defend herself.

07:55.908 --> 07:57.610
{\an5}Get off the point!

07:55.908 --> 07:57.610
Stop tripping!

07:57.677 --> 08:00.146
{\an5}Get her off.

07:57.677 --> 08:00.146
Stop tripping, Moniece.

08:00.213 --> 08:01.214
You on some...

08:01.280 --> 08:03.382
Always targeting
pregnant women.

08:03.449 --> 08:05.384
{\an4}Yeah.

08:03.449 --> 08:05.384
{\an3}(laughing)

08:05.451 --> 08:08.187
If you're gonna get pregnant,
then shut your (bleep) face.

08:08.254 --> 08:09.589
Don't talk (bleep).

08:09.655 --> 08:11.157
You didn't give a (bleep)
that she was pregnant

08:11.224 --> 08:12.925
when you were running around
on camera

08:12.992 --> 08:15.127
telling people that you
(bleep) this woman.

08:15.194 --> 08:17.129
If you're gonna go get
knocked up, then be quiet.

08:17.196 --> 08:19.232
Keep the roaches away.
That's all I'm gonna say.

08:19.298 --> 08:21.033
(Pam)
No, no, no, no.

08:21.100 --> 08:22.568
I got a bone
to pick with you too.

08:22.635 --> 08:24.437
Bone to pick?
Girl, sit your ass down.

08:24.503 --> 08:25.972
Sit <i> your</i> mother(bleep)
ass down.

08:26.038 --> 08:28.007
You sound like a damn fool.

08:28.074 --> 08:29.909
(bleeping and laughter)

08:29.976 --> 08:32.678
{\an5}I'm not asking you...

08:29.976 --> 08:32.678
You ain't innocent either,
goddamnit.

08:32.745 --> 08:33.980
{\an1}(A1)
Man, you tripping.

08:34.046 --> 08:35.615
And you sitting there
with your fake ass.

08:35.681 --> 08:36.849
{\an5}This is crazy.

08:35.681 --> 08:36.849
This is nuts.

08:36.916 --> 08:38.851
No, it's for real,
it ain't (bleep) crazy.

08:38.918 --> 08:40.953
{\an5}This (bleep) for real.

08:38.918 --> 08:40.953
{\an1}You, you making yourself
look crazy.

08:41.020 --> 08:42.587
No, I'm not,
I'm making her look stupid.

08:42.655 --> 08:44.557
{\an1}She ain't saying nothing.
You looking stupid.

08:44.624 --> 08:45.825
Yeah, but she's sitting there
looking exotic

08:45.892 --> 08:48.160
and ain't got
a goddamn dime in her pot.

08:48.227 --> 08:51.764
You pay for mother(bleep) wings,
you (bleep) fake-ass bitch.

08:51.831 --> 08:54.033
My son Loyd mad at me
right goddamn now!

08:54.100 --> 08:56.535
He texted me and said
don't ever call him again!

08:56.602 --> 08:57.603
You bitch!

08:57.670 --> 08:59.839
(audience oohing)

08:59.906 --> 09:02.074
{\an8}A1 and Lyrica, I'm just gonna
start with you guys

09:02.141 --> 09:03.576
{\an8}about the DNA test.

09:03.643 --> 09:05.511
{\an8}Tell us what the results were.

09:03.643 --> 09:05.511
{\an8}What?!

09:05.578 --> 09:06.846
{\an8}Are you better than me?

09:06.913 --> 09:08.915
{\an8}That's 'cause you (bleep)
the right (bleep).

09:08.981 --> 09:10.616
{\an8}You're a liar and a deceiver

09:10.683 --> 09:12.919
{\an8}and a cheater and a
heartbreaker, (bleep)!

09:19.225 --> 09:20.860
{\an8}(Pam)
No, (bleep) that!
I'm telling the truth.

09:20.927 --> 09:23.129
{\an8}My son Loyd mad at me
right goddamn now!

09:23.195 --> 09:24.463
{\an8}Calm down.

09:23.195 --> 09:24.463
{\an8}He texted me and said

09:24.530 --> 09:26.899
{\an8}don't ever call him again!
You bitch!

09:26.966 --> 09:29.168
{\an8}(audience oohing)

09:26.966 --> 09:29.168
{\an8}No, (bleep) that!

09:29.235 --> 09:30.369
{\an8}So, what is--

09:30.436 --> 09:31.604
{\an8}Bitch, you acting
like you innocent.

09:31.671 --> 09:33.706
{\an8}You ain't innocent!

09:31.671 --> 09:33.706
{\an8}A1, get your mom.

09:33.773 --> 09:35.675
{\an5}You (bleep) with my grandkids.

09:33.773 --> 09:35.675
I need you to sit down.

09:35.741 --> 09:37.510
{\an5}I need you to sit down.

09:35.741 --> 09:37.510
You (bleep)
with the wrong mother.

09:37.576 --> 09:39.045
My grandkids mad behind you.

09:39.111 --> 09:40.913
And you sitting there
with your fake ass.

09:40.980 --> 09:42.315
That's not my problem.

09:42.381 --> 09:43.916
{\an1}(A1)
I treat those kids

09:43.983 --> 09:45.985
{\an1}like they're mine,
you know what I'm saying?

09:46.052 --> 09:48.154
{\an5}What about her?

09:46.052 --> 09:48.154
I'm not talking about her.
I'm talking about Patrice.

09:48.220 --> 09:49.522
You sit up here
talking about Patrice,

09:49.588 --> 09:51.457
{\an5}but you give her
some of your business.

09:49.588 --> 09:51.457
You mad.

09:51.524 --> 09:53.793
{\an5}You mad because I set her up?

09:51.524 --> 09:53.793
No, you was not set up--
tell the whole thing.

09:53.859 --> 09:55.428
{\an5}No.

09:53.859 --> 09:55.428
So then what you talking about?

09:55.494 --> 09:57.330
What about when she do stuff?

09:57.396 --> 09:58.798
You give her money.

09:58.864 --> 10:00.599
{\an5}(audience oohing)

09:58.864 --> 10:00.599
Get your own (bleep) money.

10:00.666 --> 10:02.134
{\an5}Ooh! (bleep)

10:00.666 --> 10:02.134
That what you do, (bleep)

10:02.201 --> 10:04.837
{\an6}Pam...

10:02.201 --> 10:04.837
Yeah, bitch, quit asking
my son for money.

10:04.904 --> 10:06.806
You're the reason why
everything's happened.

10:06.872 --> 10:09.508
She be in y'all's goddamn
business, everything.

10:09.575 --> 10:12.078
{\an5}You buggin'.

10:09.575 --> 10:12.078
No, I ain't buggin',
I'm tellin' the goddamn truth.

10:12.144 --> 10:14.513
{\an5}And stop asking my son
for money, bitch!

10:12.144 --> 10:14.513
(Nina)
Pam...

10:14.580 --> 10:17.483
{\an5}I...

10:14.580 --> 10:17.483
My son mad at me now
'cause of your bitch ass.

10:17.550 --> 10:19.251
{\an5}(audience oohing)

10:17.550 --> 10:19.251
And your evil ass

10:19.318 --> 10:20.319
sitting there like you innocent.

10:20.386 --> 10:22.655
(Nina)
Okay, let's move on.

10:22.722 --> 10:24.390
Roccstar sailed
into the Hollywood scene--

10:24.457 --> 10:26.826
{\an5}Oh, (bleep).

10:24.457 --> 10:26.826
--and immediately began
to make waves with his

10:26.892 --> 10:28.494
overboard personality.

10:28.561 --> 10:32.164
But he nearly created a mutiny
amongst A1 and his friends

10:32.231 --> 10:34.867
when he boasted
about rocking Lyrica's boat.

10:34.934 --> 10:36.635
Will loose lips sink ships?

10:36.702 --> 10:38.571
You guys, check this out.

10:38.637 --> 10:40.439
{\an8}Has A1 seen you yet?

10:40.506 --> 10:41.774
{\an8}Does he see you right now?

10:41.841 --> 10:43.843
{\an7}This is what Lyrica
was looking like.

10:43.909 --> 10:47.179
{\an8}I'm looking at these texts
between Roccstar and Lyrica

10:47.246 --> 10:49.582
{\an8}and... "You left
your ring at the house?

10:49.648 --> 10:51.817
{\an8}Don't tell A1."

10:51.884 --> 10:54.787
{\an8}Safaree did whatever he did,
took all the Safaree (bleep),

10:54.854 --> 10:59.225
{\an8}just racing through, and then I
jumped in the mother(bleep) car.

10:59.291 --> 11:00.760
{\an8}Ooh.

10:59.291 --> 11:00.760
{\an8}Are you saying

11:00.826 --> 11:01.894
{\an8}you was (bleep) Lyrica?

11:01.961 --> 11:03.562
{\an8}It was a bumpy ride.

11:03.629 --> 11:06.665
{\an8}It was like driving
through the Sahara Desert.

11:03.629 --> 11:06.665
{\an5}(laughing)

11:06.732 --> 11:09.902
(audience oohing)

11:09.969 --> 11:11.537
(Nina)
So, it's a, a, a lot going on.

11:11.604 --> 11:13.939
I want to talk to Lyrica first.

11:14.006 --> 11:17.109
How did you feel when you saw
what Roccstar just said?

11:17.176 --> 11:19.278
{\an5}Devastated.

11:17.176 --> 11:19.278
So, A1, how does it feel

11:19.345 --> 11:20.679
to hear Roccstar
say these things

11:20.746 --> 11:21.814
about your wife and watch that?

11:21.881 --> 11:23.049
Me and Roccstar,

11:23.115 --> 11:26.652
we been shooting jabs
at each other for years.

11:26.719 --> 11:28.687
{\an5}He's a real, like,
comedian, like...

11:26.719 --> 11:28.687
Okay.

11:28.754 --> 11:30.689
{\an5}So you don't take it seriously.

11:28.754 --> 11:30.689
I don't, I don't, right now.

11:30.756 --> 11:32.058
Roccstar.

11:32.124 --> 11:34.527
This was... was this
something that you meant.

11:34.593 --> 11:37.196
You were making a joke
or were you just lying?

11:37.263 --> 11:40.199
{\an1}Like, everything I'm talking
about with Lyrica,

11:40.266 --> 11:42.134
it had nothing to do with

11:42.201 --> 11:43.869
whatever you thought
I was talking about.

11:43.936 --> 11:45.738
Just say you lied.

11:45.805 --> 11:47.373
{\an7}E'rybody lying.
You lying, he lying.

11:47.440 --> 11:48.841
{\an1}That why y'all sitting
next to each other.

11:48.908 --> 11:50.910
{\an5}I ain't never lied
in my life, period.

11:48.908 --> 11:50.910
Okay.

11:50.976 --> 11:52.711
(Ray)
When we come to the reunion,

11:52.778 --> 11:54.013
{\an8}we come to get redemption.

11:54.080 --> 11:56.549
We are sorry for
the childish (bleep) we did.

11:56.615 --> 11:58.484
{\an5}Yeah.

11:56.615 --> 11:58.484
And we want them to know that
at the reunion--

11:58.551 --> 11:59.752
{\an5}(Nina)
Ray J--

11:58.551 --> 11:59.752
--'cause we saw all of it.

11:59.819 --> 12:01.353
Let me tell you guys
what it looks like.

12:01.420 --> 12:02.655
It looks like you guys
were able to say

12:02.721 --> 12:03.889
whatever you wanted
to say and make jokes,

12:03.956 --> 12:05.157
and when somebody
asked you about it,

12:05.224 --> 12:06.826
then it's joking and we
want to make redemption.

12:06.892 --> 12:08.561
{\an5}How long I know you, A1?

12:06.892 --> 12:08.561
About 12 years.

12:08.627 --> 12:10.396
About 12 years.
I known Lyrica

12:10.463 --> 12:13.532
{\an1}completely separate
from A1 a whole long time.

12:13.599 --> 12:15.267
{\an1}If something did happen
in high school or whatever,

12:15.334 --> 12:16.569
I shouldn't even be
sitting here talking

12:16.635 --> 12:17.970
{\an1}about what
the (bleep) happened,

12:18.037 --> 12:19.939
but I did, 'cause it was the
best thing at the time to do

12:20.005 --> 12:21.340
{\an1}was, like, yo,
me and him beefin'.

12:21.407 --> 12:24.143
{\an1}Cool, we just got in a fight.
Oh, it's on now! (bleep)!

12:24.210 --> 12:25.678
So you were being petty?

12:25.744 --> 12:28.247
{\an1}I was being the ultimate
level of petty.

12:28.314 --> 12:29.782
I'm trying to laugh.

12:29.849 --> 12:32.017
Me and Roccstar are friends.
That's as far as that goes.

12:32.084 --> 12:34.120
When we saw the studio thing,
Roccstar mentioned,

12:34.186 --> 12:36.322
like, coming with
your boobs up to your neck.

12:36.388 --> 12:38.224
This is what single
looks like.

12:38.290 --> 12:40.759
What point were you trying to
make by going there like that?

12:40.826 --> 12:43.629
Me and A1 were in a fight,
so that's what that was about.

12:43.696 --> 12:47.533
{\an5}Okay. And you said that
you and A1 were on a break
from your marriage.

12:47.600 --> 12:51.070
{\an5}Was there an agreement
at that time that it was
okay to see other people?

12:51.137 --> 12:53.572
{\an1}I wasn't talking to her
and she wasn't talking to me.

12:53.639 --> 12:54.907
So during that time...

12:54.974 --> 12:57.576
Whatever the (bleep)
she would do is on her.

12:57.643 --> 12:59.712
Whatever I did was on me.

12:59.778 --> 13:04.550
{\an5}The most important thing
is that we together,
you know what I'm saying?

13:04.617 --> 13:07.119
Like, ain't nothin' like...

13:07.186 --> 13:10.389
I'm glad that you guys
are working forward.

13:10.456 --> 13:12.324
We're gonna keep it
moving, all right?

13:12.391 --> 13:15.661
{\an5}With more and more receipts
being pulled that Lyrica
had multiple affairs,

13:15.728 --> 13:20.132
{\an5}A1 eventually requested
a credit check in the
form of a DNA test.

13:20.199 --> 13:21.400
Let's take a look.

13:24.970 --> 13:26.372
I'm pregnant.

13:26.438 --> 13:28.307
What about if I
want to have a DNA?

13:28.374 --> 13:30.242
How would you feel
about that?

13:30.309 --> 13:34.180
{\an8}To believe that my daughter
cheated on your son, you're
really about to piss me off.

13:34.246 --> 13:38.050
{\an7}Well, I'm getting pissed off
too, God damn it!

13:38.117 --> 13:39.785
Get the (bleep) away
from me!

13:39.852 --> 13:41.587
{\an5}Pam, I don't think
you really understand
what's going on.

13:41.654 --> 13:43.889
{\an7}Lyrica had not just been
accused of (bleep) Safaree.

13:43.956 --> 13:45.925
{\an8}He was texting her ex.

13:43.956 --> 13:45.925
{\an8}You for real?

13:45.991 --> 13:48.827
{\an7}Let me read you his text
messages that your son sent
me when they was broke up.

13:48.894 --> 13:50.763
I caught her texting
a longtime boyfriend.

13:50.829 --> 13:52.631
She lied and said
they wasn't texting...

13:57.269 --> 13:58.571
{\an7}This really happened
for real?

13:58.637 --> 14:00.072
Yeah. How many months
is Lyrica?

14:00.139 --> 14:01.240
{\an8}Five months.

14:01.307 --> 14:02.441
{\an8}Okay, and he said
this was five months ago

14:02.508 --> 14:03.909
{\an8}that he caught her
texting another (bleep).

14:03.976 --> 14:07.546
{\an1}You want me
to get a DNA test?

14:07.613 --> 14:08.647
{\an3}Yeah.

14:11.016 --> 14:13.018
{\an4}Ooh!

14:11.016 --> 14:13.018
{\an3}Ooh!

14:13.085 --> 14:15.221
Okay, so we have
a lot to unpack.

14:15.287 --> 14:18.724
{\an5}So, A1 and Lyrica, I'm
just gonna start with you
guys about the DNA test.

14:18.791 --> 14:20.893
Can you just tell us
what the results were?

14:20.960 --> 14:21.961
I know you have them
with you.

14:22.027 --> 14:25.464
(excited chatter)

14:25.531 --> 14:30.903
"A1, you...

14:30.970 --> 14:32.404
are the father."

14:32.471 --> 14:34.206
(cheers and applause)

14:34.273 --> 14:37.209
99.9.

14:37.276 --> 14:38.811
{\an8}Nah, but let me
be real with you.

14:38.877 --> 14:40.779
{\an8}I knew I was the father.

14:40.846 --> 14:44.650
{\an5}It just hurts me that
even my own mother-in-law
would ask for a DNA test.

14:44.717 --> 14:48.687
{\an5}Like, it hurts me
that my so-called
sister-in-law would,

14:48.754 --> 14:52.224
{\an5}first of all, she didn't
know what the (bleep)
she was talking about.

14:52.291 --> 14:57.930
{\an5}But I did this DNA test
because I wanted to make sure
that A1 felt comfortable.

14:57.997 --> 14:59.598
That's all I care about.

14:59.665 --> 15:01.200
So, Pam,
you were able to see

15:01.267 --> 15:05.004
{\an5}some of the text
messages that your
daughter-in-law sent.

15:05.070 --> 15:06.705
Seeing that, hearing
what your son has said,

15:06.772 --> 15:09.875
{\an5}and now, with the
DNA test, are you
officially satisfied?

15:09.942 --> 15:11.777
I ain't gonna
sit up here and lie.

15:11.844 --> 15:16.315
{\an5}She showed it and
that's what it was and
that's all I'ma say.

15:16.382 --> 15:19.418
{\an1}Me and my
sister-in-law Patrice

15:19.485 --> 15:22.388
{\an1}had that conversation
a long time ago.

15:22.454 --> 15:27.326
{\an5}I done nothin' to her,
but you're giving my
(bleep) text messages

15:27.393 --> 15:28.560
{\an1}and you sayin' that's
(bleep) cool?

15:28.627 --> 15:29.728
No, what I'm saying is...

15:29.795 --> 15:31.697
Like, that don't
even make sense.

15:31.764 --> 15:35.301
{\an4}At the end of the day,
you get (bleep) chopped
off of that (bleep).

15:35.367 --> 15:38.604
{\an5}You cut off your
relationship with
your sister-in-law?

15:38.671 --> 15:39.838
I cut her off, yes.

15:39.905 --> 15:41.807
But do you say
what she do?

15:41.874 --> 15:43.542
That's my wife.

15:43.609 --> 15:44.610
I'm talking about her.

15:44.677 --> 15:46.278
That's my mother-in-law.

15:46.345 --> 15:47.980
She came
to your house, son,

15:48.047 --> 15:50.983
{\an5}and she started
acting all wish-washy
(bleep), you wench!

15:51.050 --> 15:52.351
{\an4}Ooh!

15:51.050 --> 15:52.351
{\an3}Ooh!

15:52.418 --> 15:54.787
Looking like
a (bleep) clown.

15:54.853 --> 15:56.055
No, shut
the (bleep) up, no!

15:56.121 --> 15:57.489
That's your problem!

15:57.556 --> 16:00.092
You tell her to shut up
every mother(bleep) time!

16:00.159 --> 16:01.827
We're gonna stop
this bull(bleep).

16:01.894 --> 16:04.496
Pam, you will not be
at my child's birth.

16:04.563 --> 16:06.765
You are so (bleep)
disrespectful,

16:06.832 --> 16:10.235
{\an5}and you will not see
your grandchild until
you (bleep) apologize.

16:10.302 --> 16:12.371
You are an evil witch.

16:12.438 --> 16:15.174
{\an4}Lyrica, that's not
cool, what you said.
I'm not going for that.

16:15.240 --> 16:18.177
{\an5}What? No, what's not
cool is what your
mama just said.

16:18.243 --> 16:20.646
{\an1}No! Everybody
shut the (bleep) up!

16:20.713 --> 16:22.614
(overlapping arguing)

16:22.681 --> 16:24.550
She didn't even (bleep)
apologize to me

16:24.616 --> 16:27.119
for asking me for
a mother(bleep) DNA test!

16:27.186 --> 16:29.355
That broke
my (bleep) heart!

16:29.421 --> 16:31.423
I can't take any more
of this pregnant abuse

16:31.490 --> 16:33.592
that's going on
with the animosity.

16:33.659 --> 16:34.860
Don't tell me (bleep)!

16:34.927 --> 16:36.295
This is too much.
I'm not gonna--

16:36.362 --> 16:39.898
I'm stopping.
This is a lot. Calm down.

16:39.965 --> 16:42.935
{\an5}Lyrica! Lyrica,
wait one second.
One second. This is crazy.

16:43.001 --> 16:46.105
{\an5}And I'ma tell you,
I have no--

16:43.001 --> 16:46.105
Pam, wait! Just, please!

16:46.171 --> 16:47.306
She's upset.

16:47.373 --> 16:48.507
I'm just being honest.

16:48.574 --> 16:49.775
You guys, we gotta
stop for a second.

16:49.842 --> 16:51.643
Okay, I just need
everybody to be quiet.

16:51.710 --> 16:54.613
{\an5}Lyrica, I want you to
say your piece because I
don't want you screaming,

16:54.680 --> 16:56.782
{\an5}and then we're gonna
take a break, 'cause
this is too much.

16:56.849 --> 16:58.617
All right, go ahead,
Lyrica.

16:58.684 --> 17:04.156
First of all, to sit here
and hear my mother-in-law

17:04.223 --> 17:07.092
call my mom a bitch
is (bleep) heartbreaking,

17:07.159 --> 17:09.728
and not one time has
she looked in that camera

17:09.795 --> 17:11.029
and said, you know what,
daughter?

17:11.096 --> 17:13.165
I'm sorry that I said
I wanted a DNA test.

17:13.232 --> 17:14.433
I'm sorry I didn't
believe you.

17:14.500 --> 17:17.301
I'm sorry I
dragged you all season.

17:17.368 --> 17:20.172
You know what? Beyond
everything, Lyrica,

17:20.239 --> 17:21.573
you are pregnant,
you are glowing.

17:21.640 --> 17:23.142
I am sorry
that you're screaming.

17:23.208 --> 17:24.710
I want you to have
a healthy pregnancy.

17:24.777 --> 17:27.679
A1, I'm so happy that you
guys have cleared this up.

17:27.746 --> 17:29.948
I wish you
nothing but the best.

17:30.015 --> 17:31.650
Y'all (bleep) with my boy,
you know what I'm saying?

17:31.717 --> 17:34.920
I don't want you screaming.
We're gonna stop, all right?

17:34.987 --> 17:36.388
Things are getting
heated in here.

17:36.455 --> 17:38.290
We'll be right back.

17:38.357 --> 17:40.492
{\an5}I didn't come on TV to
seen here, tearing this
(bleep) down like that.

17:40.559 --> 17:42.127
If I want to sit there and
not do that, guess what?

17:42.194 --> 17:43.695
I won't do it.

17:43.762 --> 17:46.665
{\an8}Are you going to
pursue getting back
any of your money?

17:46.732 --> 17:48.300
Take me to jail.
Lock me up.

17:48.367 --> 17:49.368
{\an5}Oh!

17:48.367 --> 17:49.368
{\an3}Oh!

17:49.435 --> 17:52.538
{\an8}Oh, my God!

17:52.604 --> 17:54.773
{\an7}Real ridiculous
(bleep) going on.

{\an8}Welcome back to "Love &amp; Hip Hop
Hollywood: The Reunion."

18:07.052 --> 18:11.757
{\an8}Now please welcome to the stage
Amber Diamond and Shun Love.

18:11.824 --> 18:13.525
Welcome, ladies.
You both look beautiful.

18:13.592 --> 18:14.793
{\an3}Thank you.

18:13.592 --> 18:14.793
Thank you so much.

18:14.860 --> 18:16.462
After being shot down
by Apple Watts,

18:16.528 --> 18:18.964
Roccstar took Shun Love's
20 bands off her

18:19.031 --> 18:21.099
to record her track for
her daughter, Amber Diamond,

18:21.166 --> 18:24.803
{\an5}and although he thought
he'd be able to make
magic out of tragic,

18:24.870 --> 18:28.474
{\an5}his diamond in the
rough turned out to be,
well, just rough.

18:28.540 --> 18:30.776
{\an8}I been trying to figure out
how I can make her a star.

18:30.843 --> 18:33.412
{\an7}Okay.
What y'all got?
'Cause I love Amber.

18:33.479 --> 18:35.147
{\an8}Okay, so we gonna go
with what's in my purse.

18:35.214 --> 18:36.648
{\an8}Oh, (bleep)!

18:36.715 --> 18:41.954
{\an7}I just want to tell you,
Whitney, Mariah,
Amber Diamond.

18:42.020 --> 18:44.223
No way. No. No.

18:44.289 --> 18:52.931
{\an8}(singing off-key)

18:52.998 --> 18:56.969
{\an7}For a $20,000 (bleep),
that (bleep) is bull(bleep).

18:57.035 --> 19:00.672
{\an8}Hey, why don't you press
play on Amber's vocals

19:00.739 --> 19:02.541
{\an8}before I did
surgery to 'em?

19:02.608 --> 19:05.677
{\an8}(off-key singing)

19:05.744 --> 19:08.380
{\an9}What?

19:05.744 --> 19:08.380
{\an8}Come around here!

19:08.447 --> 19:11.583
{\an8}Oh, my God!
The dramatic (bleep)!

19:11.650 --> 19:13.585
So, Roccstar,

19:13.652 --> 19:16.989
why did you initially want to
work with Amber Diamond?

19:17.055 --> 19:20.025
Amber, she's bad, so
it's like, okay, shoot,

19:20.092 --> 19:22.561
{\an5}I might be able to
get someone to conference
with this situation,

19:22.628 --> 19:24.930
and that's what
I was doing, you know?

19:24.997 --> 19:27.499
Amber, 'cause you truly felt
like you had potential,

19:27.566 --> 19:28.934
you had something
you could work with?

19:29.001 --> 19:31.703
{\an8}Well, first of all, that
song wasn't for my voice.

19:31.770 --> 19:33.705
I sing deep,
I don't sing high.

19:33.772 --> 19:34.940
You're not fazed
by what happened?

19:35.007 --> 19:36.775
I'm not fazed by nothin'.

19:36.842 --> 19:38.877
I mean, I think Amber needs
to be a model, to be honest.

19:38.944 --> 19:41.246
Like, that'd be super dope.

19:41.313 --> 19:44.383
I love Amber. I think
Amber's super cool.

19:44.449 --> 19:46.752
{\an5}You sayin' she's super
cool, but you were making
fun of her in the studio.

19:46.818 --> 19:50.656
You said, Whitney,
Mariah, Amber Diamond.

19:50.722 --> 19:53.358
Say Naomi, Tyra,
Amber Diamond.

19:53.425 --> 19:54.493
That's what
you meant to say.

19:54.560 --> 19:55.627
{\an1}Naomi, Tyra,
Amber Diamond.

19:55.694 --> 19:57.930
Right, okay.
Thank you.

19:57.996 --> 20:01.066
{\an5}And I actually took them
vocals and made 'em
sound like some (bleep).

20:01.133 --> 20:02.367
{\an5}Did you hear that?

20:01.133 --> 20:02.367
I didn't buy the song.

20:02.434 --> 20:03.769
Shun wasn't feelin' it,
for some reason.

20:03.835 --> 20:06.104
{\an8}I didn't like it, and
then I saw on the show

20:06.171 --> 20:07.573
where he played
her raw vocals

20:07.639 --> 20:09.508
and my attorney said
I had a lawsuit.

20:09.575 --> 20:11.643
You ain't suing me.
You sound dumb.

20:11.710 --> 20:13.612
Nothing's about me
dumb, buddy.

20:13.679 --> 20:15.080
You're old.
Don't talk to me.

20:15.147 --> 20:18.951
My (bleep)...
Listen, everybody knows...

20:19.017 --> 20:21.520
Shush! Nobody cares.
Sit back down.

20:21.587 --> 20:23.388
What old bitch
look like that?

20:23.455 --> 20:26.425
{\an5}Ain't nobody tryin' to hit
that old ass (bleep)
except for Solo Lucci.

20:26.491 --> 20:28.460
{\an3}Word!

20:28.527 --> 20:29.628
I know!

20:29.695 --> 20:32.331
Why bring the raw vocals
to the party?

20:32.397 --> 20:37.035
{\an5}Because if y'all don't
respect the fact that I
did insatiable surgery,

20:37.102 --> 20:38.770
then I'm gonna be
hollerin' about it.

20:38.837 --> 20:40.772
So, did anything ever
happen between you two?

20:40.839 --> 20:43.041
No, I ain't never
touch Amber.

20:43.108 --> 20:46.244
{\an5}Amber is one of the only
cast-mates on this show
I've never touched.

20:46.311 --> 20:48.513
{\an6}Oh!

20:46.311 --> 20:48.513
{\an1}Oh!

20:48.580 --> 20:50.482
{\an5}You said one of the only?

20:48.580 --> 20:50.482
{\an3}(laughs)

20:50.549 --> 20:52.284
I ain't touched you
either, Apple.

20:52.351 --> 20:55.253
{\an8}Wait a minute. Are you
trying to say it's a
little bit of a list?

20:55.320 --> 20:58.457
Man, there's been four, maybe
four, four or five of 'em.

20:58.523 --> 21:00.859
Four or five?
You tell me who.

21:00.926 --> 21:02.160
I'm not telling you who.

21:02.227 --> 21:04.062
So, but you are saying
four to five. Okay.

21:04.129 --> 21:05.697
(laughs) It's crazy.

21:05.764 --> 21:09.334
{\an5}(laughter and chatter)

21:05.764 --> 21:09.334
It's crazy.

21:09.401 --> 21:12.371
Now, with the desire to make
a better life for herself,

21:12.437 --> 21:16.842
{\an5}Apple Watts decided to
hang up the strip club
in favor of the studio.

21:16.908 --> 21:19.211
I'm just tired of dancing,
I'm tired of struggling.

21:19.277 --> 21:21.813
{\an5}Once you stop strippin',
if you ain't saved no
money, that is it.

21:21.880 --> 21:26.551
{\an7}I need to know about
your personal life, your
business life, all as one.

21:26.618 --> 21:28.120
I gotta go
to jail next month.

21:28.186 --> 21:29.888
{\an7}And you're going
to jail for?

21:29.955 --> 21:32.758
{\an8}A violation, basically.
I'm only doing a month.

21:32.824 --> 21:36.928
{\an7}So my life, growing up,
was kind of rough,
so I can relate.

21:36.995 --> 21:38.497
{\an7}I want to hear
what you got going on

21:38.563 --> 21:40.932
{\an8}so we can see if we can
make some (bleep) shake.

21:40.999 --> 21:43.869
{\an5}So a bitch about to go
into the county right
now to just see.

21:43.935 --> 21:45.237
Time to get
the bitch locked up

21:45.303 --> 21:47.105
and tryin' to get
the (bleep) out.

21:47.172 --> 21:52.110
(cheers and applause)

21:52.177 --> 21:54.846
{\an5}A1, what was it about
Apple that made you
want to work with her?

21:54.913 --> 21:57.916
Her personality
and her hunger.

21:57.983 --> 22:00.252
How did you feel about
his vision for a "strapper"?

22:00.318 --> 22:02.654
{\an1}I'ma keep that poppin'.
I liked working that out.

22:02.721 --> 22:04.156
And Solo Lucci approves.

22:04.222 --> 22:06.925
It seemed like you really
wanted to work with Apple.

22:06.992 --> 22:08.393
What made you
interested in her?

22:08.460 --> 22:10.762
I have this Captain
Save-a-ho mentality,

22:10.829 --> 22:15.233
{\an5}so at the end of the day,
I wanted to put her on.

22:10.829 --> 22:15.233
Okay.

22:15.300 --> 22:18.303
{\an5}I just feel like they
came from the same
place, basically

22:18.370 --> 22:20.672
and, you know, they
gonna see eye to eye.

22:20.739 --> 22:22.774
Seemed like Shun was
setting some things up.

22:22.841 --> 22:25.043
{\an1}Shun was setting things up.
She was doing her thing.

22:25.110 --> 22:28.113
But I can't just sit around.
I'm just sitting here, broke.

22:28.180 --> 22:30.148
{\an4}And when I met her, she
didn't have no money,
so she was dancing.

22:30.215 --> 22:33.985
(overlapping arguing)

22:34.052 --> 22:35.654
I don't give a (bleep)!

22:35.721 --> 22:39.191
(overlapping arguing)

22:39.257 --> 22:41.860
{\an5}Don't ever accept (bleep)
from nobody, 'cause
what they gonna do?

22:41.927 --> 22:43.595
Throw it in your face.

22:43.662 --> 22:48.166
(overlapping arguing)

22:48.233 --> 22:49.801
Apple, I need
to be able to speak.

22:49.868 --> 22:54.673
{\an5}Now, this is
a $17,000 notarized
itinerary, basically,

22:54.740 --> 22:57.275
so she's saying that
she spent over $17,000.

22:57.342 --> 22:59.511
{\an4}When you ain't working
and you can't go to
the strip club,

22:59.578 --> 23:01.379
all you got to do
is depend on her.

23:01.446 --> 23:03.148
What else (bleep) am I
gonna keep running up?

23:03.215 --> 23:04.783
That's (bleep) up to me!

23:04.850 --> 23:06.818
{\an5}Are you going
to pursue getting
back any of your money

23:06.885 --> 23:08.353
or are you gonna
call it a wash?

23:08.420 --> 23:09.421
My money's coming,
my money's coming.

23:09.488 --> 23:11.089
Oh, you're gonna
go after her.

23:11.156 --> 23:12.157
You want to be reimbursed.

23:12.224 --> 23:16.128
(laughter)

23:16.194 --> 23:18.029
Take me jail.
Lock me up.

23:18.096 --> 23:19.564
Throw away the key.

23:19.631 --> 23:22.501
Let me ask... Let me go back
to Shun, who offered to say,

23:22.567 --> 23:25.203
{\an5}listen, I want you out
of the club so I'm gonna
help provide for you, so...

23:25.270 --> 23:27.773
{\an1}One second. I never said,
I want you out of the club.

23:27.839 --> 23:29.841
She said she didn't
want to be a stripper.

23:29.908 --> 23:31.243
You forgot
where you came from?

23:31.309 --> 23:38.450
(overlapping arguing)

23:38.517 --> 23:42.220
No! Yeah, he'll let
you suck his toe, bitch!

23:42.287 --> 23:43.455
Okay, so wait a minute.

23:43.522 --> 23:46.725
{\an1}I didn't get no mother(bleep)
money doing it!

23:46.792 --> 23:48.326
What is going on?

23:48.393 --> 23:52.297
Apple! Apple! Apple!
Apple! Apple, I need you.

23:52.364 --> 23:54.232
{\an5}We're gonna move on.

23:52.364 --> 23:54.232
Okay, next subject.

23:54.299 --> 23:56.001
All right.
Was the money a loan?

23:56.067 --> 23:59.137
{\an5}I never wanted to do
anything but help her
from the beginning,

23:59.204 --> 24:02.407
{\an4}because in the end,
Apple's the one who
sent me a text message

24:02.474 --> 24:04.576
to kill our business
relationship.

24:04.643 --> 24:06.244
{\an5}You didn't want to?

24:04.643 --> 24:06.244
{\an3}No.

24:06.311 --> 24:07.679
She says she didn't
want to end it.

24:07.746 --> 24:10.182
{\an4}Maybe to text message
probably wasn't
the best way...

24:10.248 --> 24:11.449
She sounds like
she cares about you.

24:11.516 --> 24:13.718
{\an1}You know, as y'all seen,
my past is (bleep).

24:13.785 --> 24:15.687
Do you think you might have
pushed her away some?

24:15.754 --> 24:18.290
{\an1}I mean, it probably was that,
but at the end of the day,

24:18.356 --> 24:21.259
{\an4}I'm just misunderstood,
you know?

24:18.356 --> 24:21.259
I sent you texts.

24:21.326 --> 24:23.562
{\an5}"Apple, I love you."
I said, "Apple,
you gonna be fine."

24:23.628 --> 24:26.665
{\an5}I said, "From today,
your struggles are over."
I told you that.

24:26.731 --> 24:30.068
{\an4}But then, all the struggles
can be over, but I still
got to pay it back.

24:30.135 --> 24:32.370
I don't give a (bleep)
about that money.

24:32.437 --> 24:36.508
{\an5}All I wanted to happen
was you to get ahead,
so let's just...

24:36.575 --> 24:39.244
Breathe, Apple, breathe!

24:39.311 --> 24:42.147
One, two,
three, four, five.

24:42.214 --> 24:45.350
{\an5}All I wanted was y'all
to be cool again, because
that's my (bleep)...

24:45.417 --> 24:46.585
(overlapping chatter)

24:46.651 --> 24:48.987
...best friend, and I
don't like that.

24:49.054 --> 24:50.856
All right, guys.
We're gonna move on.

24:50.922 --> 24:53.258
I hope you guys can come to
a common ground at some point.

24:53.325 --> 24:55.594
{\an5}We can figure it out.

24:53.325 --> 24:55.594
All right.

24:55.660 --> 24:57.562
For the past six years,
Apple struggled

24:57.629 --> 24:59.431
to move beyond the
fear factors of her past

24:59.497 --> 25:02.467
{\an5}and build a
relationship with her
long-lost father John,

25:02.534 --> 25:05.103
but in a strange twist,
it was revealed

25:05.170 --> 25:10.575
{\an5}that he was indeed not the
father and had been daddy
catfishing her all along.

25:10.642 --> 25:13.311
The results are in.

25:13.378 --> 25:16.114
Probability, 0.00.

25:16.181 --> 25:23.021
{\an8}33 years ago, your mom
and I did a DNA, and I
was not the father.

25:25.657 --> 25:26.658
Okay.

25:26.725 --> 25:28.627
{\an1}Aw!

25:26.725 --> 25:28.627
{\an3}Aw!

25:28.693 --> 25:33.365
{\an5}All right, so we do
have John Watts
joining us via remote.

25:33.431 --> 25:35.667
{\an8}John, welcome to the show.

25:35.734 --> 25:38.136
{\an8}Hello. Thank you.
(audience booing)

25:38.203 --> 25:41.006
Apple, how did you feel
when you read the results?

25:41.072 --> 25:43.875
I mean, now I don't care.
I don't care about him.

25:43.942 --> 25:45.377
I just care
about the situation.

25:45.443 --> 25:48.580
So, John, you knew you
weren't the father then.

25:48.647 --> 25:51.216
{\an1}Why not just tell her,
hey, I'll be there for you,

25:51.283 --> 25:53.885
{\an1}but just so you know,
I'm not your dad.

25:53.952 --> 25:57.589
I said, Apple,
I'm not your father

25:57.656 --> 26:01.126
because I had a DNA
when you was a little kid.

26:01.192 --> 26:03.295
I said that
that day six years ago.

26:03.361 --> 26:07.766
{\an5}So, six years ago,
he's saying he told you
then about the DNA test.

26:07.832 --> 26:12.370
{\an4}He sat down with Adena
and talked, and I'm the one
that brought up a DNA test.

26:12.437 --> 26:16.341
{\an5}Did you feel that there were
some weird motives with him
pretending to be your father?

26:16.408 --> 26:18.376
Yeah, of course
it's weird.

26:18.443 --> 26:21.479
{\an4}It just makes me even worse
of a person, like, to not
trust nobody even more.

26:21.546 --> 26:23.381
What did I do wrong?

26:23.448 --> 26:26.184
You showed up
and you lied, fool.

26:26.251 --> 26:29.921
{\an5}What was it about him
being a father figure
rubbed you the wrong way?

26:31.990 --> 26:36.461
{\an4}Literally, at that time,
I really cared for Apple
like my daughter,

26:36.528 --> 26:40.365
{\an5}so I felt like the mom
and I knew immediately
when I seen him.

26:40.432 --> 26:41.866
You knew?

26:41.933 --> 26:45.470
{\an5}Immediately, 'cause
he kinda ugly and
Apple's a cute girl.

26:45.537 --> 26:48.273
{\an5}John, what were you
hoping would have
been the end result

26:48.340 --> 26:49.874
after these results
were read?

26:49.941 --> 26:52.143
Well, I was hoping
that she and I

26:52.210 --> 26:55.847
could have still tried
to build a relationship.

26:55.914 --> 26:59.918
Would you ever be interested
in John as a father figure?

26:59.985 --> 27:01.186
I'm fine. I'm good.

27:01.252 --> 27:03.855
It's done now.
It's over with.

27:03.922 --> 27:06.758
I'm already...

27:06.825 --> 27:08.994
Okay, John, it sounds
like there might be

27:09.060 --> 27:10.662
some communication
that could happen,

27:10.729 --> 27:12.931
{\an5}but it doesn't sound
like Apple is open
to that right now

27:12.998 --> 27:14.666
and, honestly,
I don't blame her.

27:14.733 --> 27:16.768
Goodbye, John.

27:16.835 --> 27:18.770
Thank you so much
for joining us, John.

27:18.837 --> 27:21.740
(bleep)! Bye, John!

27:21.806 --> 27:22.907
We're gonna take a break.

27:22.974 --> 27:25.543
More from the reunion
when we return.

27:25.610 --> 27:27.846
(cheers and applause)

27:27.912 --> 27:30.515
{\an8}She loves playing
the victim role.

27:27.912 --> 27:30.515
{\an5}I don't give two (bleep).

27:30.582 --> 27:34.953
{\an7}Like, until you're walking
in my shoes, go (bleep)
(bleep) yourself.

27:35.020 --> 27:38.857
{\an7}You eat a peach like you
a (bleep) housewife, bitch!

27:38.923 --> 27:40.859
{\an8}♪♪

27:44.562 --> 27:45.563
{\an8}♪♪

27:45.630 --> 27:49.401
(cheers and applause)

27:49.467 --> 27:52.470
{\an8}Welcome back to "Love &amp; Hip Hop
Hollywood: The Reunion."

27:52.537 --> 27:56.574
{\an5}What Moniece had hoped
would be a triumphant year
turned into a trying one.

27:56.641 --> 27:58.877
It started with
a public breakup with AD

27:58.943 --> 28:01.379
and ended with
a breakdown in the studio.

28:01.446 --> 28:03.248
Let's take a look.

28:03.314 --> 28:06.551
{\an8}Want to jump in the booth
and, like, let's...
to do it an octave up?

28:06.618 --> 28:10.355
{\an7}I'm down.

28:10.422 --> 28:12.891
{\an8}Why is she taking so long
to get in the booth?

28:12.957 --> 28:15.393
{\an8}I have a woman here
who has collapsed.

28:15.460 --> 28:17.462
{\an8}We'll just lay her down flat.
No eating or drinking.

28:17.529 --> 28:19.364
{\an7}It's probably just
a panic attack, for sure.

28:19.431 --> 28:22.634
{\an8}(crying)
This is so crazy.

28:22.700 --> 28:24.836
{\an8}I'm taking a medication.

28:24.903 --> 28:27.005
{\an7}The dosage was raised
the night before

28:27.072 --> 28:28.840
{\an8}and my body was just
totally out of whack.

28:28.907 --> 28:30.942
{\an7}I'd been
feeling crazy all day.

28:31.009 --> 28:33.378
{\an8}I will tell you this,
since we're having
a moment.

28:33.445 --> 28:36.581
{\an8}I did get in the booth
and sing your song
while you was gone.

28:36.648 --> 28:38.316
{\an7}I don't want to be
around you.

28:38.383 --> 28:42.053
{\an8}You can't face (bleep)
about you that you
can't handle.

28:42.120 --> 28:44.355
{\an7}You're still in mess
after mess after mess
after mess.

28:44.422 --> 28:46.891
{\an8}But, for the last time,
we're going to (bleep).

28:51.196 --> 28:54.199
{\an5}So, that evoked a lot
of emotion out of you,
Moniece.

28:54.265 --> 28:55.834
This year has been
a lot for you.

28:55.900 --> 28:57.035
How are things
with you and AD?

28:57.102 --> 28:58.103
Can you give us an update?

28:58.169 --> 28:59.704
{\an7}It's touch, it's go.
I love her.

28:59.771 --> 29:02.273
{\an7}I definitely see
a future with her.

29:02.340 --> 29:04.109
{\an7}We're figuring it out,
you know?

29:04.175 --> 29:06.478
Let's talk a little bit
about the studio session.

29:06.544 --> 29:09.147
How did it feel for you,
watching it back

29:09.214 --> 29:13.618
{\an5}and seeing it kind of be
made fun of and there be
like a jovial part to it?

29:13.685 --> 29:15.120
I don't give two (bleep).

29:15.186 --> 29:18.089
{\an4}Like, until you're
walking in my shoes,
go (bleep) yourself.

29:18.156 --> 29:20.091
(applause)

29:20.158 --> 29:22.527
{\an7}I'm gonna laugh at it
because I know you, Moniece.

29:22.594 --> 29:24.562
{\an4}I don't care if
the world thinks, oh,
it's her mental health.

29:24.629 --> 29:26.231
She loves playing
the victim role.

29:26.297 --> 29:27.465
{\an1}You can't play
the victim role with me.

29:27.532 --> 29:28.666
{\an1}I know you all the way
around the board.

29:28.733 --> 29:30.168
I know how you get down.

29:30.235 --> 29:32.203
I didn't say, Oh, my God,
I'm (bleep) mentally ill.

29:32.270 --> 29:33.271
You ain't took medication
in seven years.

29:33.338 --> 29:35.773
Oh! Oh, my God!

29:35.840 --> 29:44.549
{\an8}(overlapping chatter)

29:44.616 --> 29:46.251
{\an1}No, you're a ridiculous
mother(bleep),

29:46.317 --> 29:48.186
{\an1}fighting with
a goddamn woman.

29:48.253 --> 29:50.488
What are you talk--
Oh, my God!

29:50.555 --> 29:51.990
Shut up!

29:52.056 --> 29:53.091
You doing the Tina Turner?

29:53.158 --> 29:56.194
{\an8}Shut up!
Sit your old ass down.

29:56.261 --> 29:57.462
Sit down.
You old as hell!

29:57.529 --> 29:59.831
You're not Ray J.
You not even A1,

29:59.898 --> 30:03.067
{\an1}'cause you're the type
of (bleep) that I (bleep)!

30:03.134 --> 30:04.836
I don't want to talk to you!

30:04.903 --> 30:08.573
{\an1}You eat a peach like you
a (bleep) housewife, bitch!

30:08.640 --> 30:10.041
{\an8}(chatter and applause)

30:10.108 --> 30:12.310
{\an8}Why is she over there,
even standing up?

30:12.377 --> 30:14.012
Man, I'm good,
I'm good, I'm good.

30:14.078 --> 30:15.513
{\an8}Any woman that can
bring this type of man
into the world...

30:15.580 --> 30:16.681
{\an8}Shut up, homes!

30:16.748 --> 30:18.449
{\an8}That woman needs
to be taken away!

30:18.516 --> 30:19.751
Get out of here
with all the...

30:19.817 --> 30:22.020
You got the females
on your side for sure.

30:22.086 --> 30:24.756
{\an8}You got the females
on your side.

30:24.822 --> 30:26.524
Get him out of here!

30:26.591 --> 30:30.461
{\an5}Let's regroup,
let's regroup.
All right, guys.

30:30.528 --> 30:33.298
{\an5}Everybody on the couches,
we're regrouping here.
We're gonna regroup.

30:33.364 --> 30:36.968
Obviously, Roccstar has left.
We gonna let him cool off.

30:37.035 --> 30:38.303
So, we're gonna shift gears.

30:38.369 --> 30:40.672
JayWill was hungry to shed
his Kandie coating

30:40.738 --> 30:44.909
{\an5}in favor of performing
as his true self.
Let's take a look.

30:44.976 --> 30:48.313
{\an8}But one day a few years ago,
I realized, people
want to make fun of me,

30:48.379 --> 30:51.349
{\an8}I could beat 'em to
the punch, so I
came up with Kandie,

30:51.416 --> 30:55.019
{\an8}and he is well put
together, funny, and
a damn good rapper.

30:55.086 --> 30:57.889
(rapping)

30:57.956 --> 30:59.057
{\an8}♪ Put my hands on my knee ♪

30:59.123 --> 31:00.592
{\an8}♪ Pop my assets
with my weave ♪

31:00.658 --> 31:06.431
(rapping)

31:06.497 --> 31:10.168
(cheering)

31:10.235 --> 31:11.536
(cheers and applause)

31:11.603 --> 31:15.373
Okay. Great performance.

31:15.440 --> 31:18.309
{\an5}It seems like there was
a bit of a struggle
between you and Kandie.

31:18.376 --> 31:22.313
{\an5}Do you think you'll
retire Kandie and be
JayWill all the time?

31:22.380 --> 31:24.983
{\an5}Listen, like, as long
as these bitches is
buying front twos,

31:25.049 --> 31:29.454
{\an5}I'm selling 'em,
like, hey, y'all,
it's your boy Kandie.

31:29.520 --> 31:31.289
What will be your focus
with the music, though?

31:31.356 --> 31:33.224
Is it gonna be more
JayWill or more Kandie?

31:33.291 --> 31:34.592
Honestly, present JayWill.

31:34.659 --> 31:36.794
I feel like I've done
enough talking

31:36.861 --> 31:39.330
about trying to bring
awareness to listen.

31:39.397 --> 31:40.865
{\an5}I feel like now
is the time, like, okay,
y'all, listen,

31:40.932 --> 31:42.667
let me make sure to what you
want to all hear play.

31:42.734 --> 31:44.135
It's not about looking gay.

31:44.202 --> 31:46.604
It's that I have more records
not about my sexuality

31:46.671 --> 31:48.239
{\an5}that it's about--
that's what mind-blows me.
Like, people be like,

31:48.306 --> 31:49.440
oh, we don't want to
hear that gay (bleep).

31:49.507 --> 31:51.209
If you get played,
you would know.

31:51.276 --> 31:53.244
(applause)

31:53.311 --> 31:57.382
{\an5}Do you think when you
guys had the fallout, was
it more about solidarity

31:57.448 --> 32:00.218
or did you feel like he
was trying to stop your bag?

32:00.285 --> 32:03.388
I think his anger and
his passion stem from him

32:03.454 --> 32:06.858
{\an5}just going through
the struggles of
trying to figure out

32:06.924 --> 32:09.127
where he fits in
in this industry.

32:09.193 --> 32:11.029
I don't think it
was anything personal.

32:11.095 --> 32:13.931
{\an4}I want to take a moment
to, like, apologize
to La'Britney.

32:13.998 --> 32:16.834
{\an4}I don't want to allow
the way I feel to
come off negatively

32:16.901 --> 32:19.871
{\an4}towards a beautiful,
talented woman who's
been a supportive friend,

32:19.937 --> 32:21.706
{\an1}so I'll be like,
you know what?

32:21.773 --> 32:23.241
That wasn't my bag,
you know what I mean?

32:23.308 --> 32:26.244
{\an4}And I got frustrated
with the situation
more so than you

32:26.311 --> 32:27.679
{\an1}and the way it
came out wasn't right.

32:27.745 --> 32:31.482
{\an8}I totally accept. Respect.
You know, I love you.

32:31.549 --> 32:34.986
JayWill and Kandie,
period.

32:35.053 --> 32:36.187
Thank you.

32:36.254 --> 32:37.922
Kimberly, you were
there that night.

32:37.989 --> 32:39.157
How did you think he did?

32:39.223 --> 32:41.859
I think he did amazing.

32:41.926 --> 32:43.728
Solo, how do you feel
about his music?

32:43.795 --> 32:45.863
I went to the open mic
and his performance

32:45.930 --> 32:48.266
was a mother(bleep),
you know what I'm saying?

32:48.333 --> 32:52.136
{\an8}The words I heard was a lot of,
like, (bleep) and going...

32:52.203 --> 32:55.773
(laughter)

32:55.840 --> 32:58.343
I drop one (bleep)
and I get three mo'.

32:58.409 --> 33:00.812
There you go!

33:00.878 --> 33:03.014
That's something the
world will never know.

33:03.081 --> 33:05.416
(bleep) finally
got three more.

33:05.483 --> 33:07.318
Wasn't no (bleep),
no (bleep)!

33:07.385 --> 33:09.087
If (bleep) got three bigs,
something getting (bleep).

33:09.153 --> 33:11.055
{\an5}I'm just telling you
my perception, you
feel what I'm saying?

33:11.122 --> 33:12.523
And after you just
said what you said,

33:12.590 --> 33:14.292
I want to hear the words
so I can tell you mine.

33:14.359 --> 33:15.760
You want to hear more?

33:15.827 --> 33:19.764
I appreciate Lucci so much
because he came up to me,

33:19.831 --> 33:22.533
{\an5}he was like, brah, it's
a lot to take in, but
your did your thing,

33:22.600 --> 33:25.136
{\an5}you know, and that's all
I ask for is respect
for the artist.

33:25.203 --> 33:27.939
{\an5}You know, even if you
don't understand it,
judge talent for talent,

33:28.005 --> 33:29.440
and he did that,
and I thank you.

33:29.507 --> 33:30.842
(applause)

33:30.908 --> 33:33.144
All right, JayWill, well,
we wish you and Kandie

33:33.211 --> 33:35.947
the best on
both of your careers.

33:36.013 --> 33:38.216
More "Love &amp; Hip Hop"
when the reunion returns.

33:38.282 --> 33:41.018
(cheers and applause)

33:41.085 --> 33:42.587
{\an8}That's like a soft spot.

33:42.653 --> 33:43.788
{\an9}Aw!

33:42.653 --> 33:43.788
{\an7}Aw!

33:43.855 --> 33:46.357
{\an8}It's really heavy
on me right now.

33:46.424 --> 33:48.793
{\an7}I want the ones with
no father, none of that.

33:48.860 --> 33:49.994
{\an8}I'm gonna be your daddy.

33:50.061 --> 33:51.062
{\an9}Oh!

33:50.061 --> 33:51.062
{\an7}Oh!

33:51.129 --> 33:53.064
{\an8}♪♪

33:56.634 --> 33:58.002
{\an8}♪♪

33:58.069 --> 34:00.071
We're leaving, but I will
take some of this money

34:00.138 --> 34:02.673
{\an8}and go to the mall, and we
about to go sit courtside.

34:02.740 --> 34:03.975
We got a lot of
(bleep) going on.

34:06.411 --> 34:09.045
{\an5}Looks like Roccstar
and A1 have settled
their differences

34:09.112 --> 34:11.149
and are about to
hit the streets.

34:11.215 --> 34:14.351
{\an8}Welcome back to "Love &amp; Hip Hop
Hollywood: The Reunion."

34:14.418 --> 34:18.456
{\an5}Now, this season saw its
share of larger-than-life
personalities,

34:18.523 --> 34:22.360
{\an5}but this particular
breakout star was
able to top them all.

34:22.427 --> 34:25.763
Ladies and gentlemen,
Ray J's bouncing beanie.

34:25.830 --> 34:28.299
Oh, y'all playing that?

34:28.366 --> 34:30.568
Congrats, bro, your
(bleep)'s everywhere.

34:30.635 --> 34:31.969
Damn, you know
what I'm saying?

34:32.036 --> 34:33.404
What the (bleep)?

34:36.440 --> 34:41.646
{\an5}You being accused
of sexual acts with
other people's wives.

34:41.712 --> 34:43.815
You told A1,
"bitches like me."

34:43.880 --> 34:46.250
{\an1}I accidentally sent her
a different type of picture.

34:46.317 --> 34:48.853
{\an5}You sent her the picture
that everybody looking
at right now?

34:48.920 --> 34:50.188
{\an1}I didn't do it
on purpose, though.

34:50.254 --> 34:51.456
Come on, man.

34:51.522 --> 34:53.458
You know you smashed.

34:53.524 --> 34:54.891
She admitted it, fam.

34:54.958 --> 34:56.594
Why did you do that?
I thought that you

34:56.661 --> 34:57.929
would deny and deny it,
but now that you

34:57.995 --> 35:00.064
admitted it, I don't
think I wanted to know.

35:00.131 --> 35:01.933
Lyrica really
didn't admit it.

35:01.999 --> 35:03.534
I just needed
to know for myself.

35:03.601 --> 35:04.902
(airhorn)

35:04.969 --> 35:07.004
Hey, Ray J,
your beanie's bouncin'!

35:07.071 --> 35:08.439
(applause)

35:08.506 --> 35:10.308
Ray J had that coming.

35:10.374 --> 35:13.444
{\an8}Well, in honor of you
breaking the Internet
with your beanie,

35:13.511 --> 35:16.981
{\an8}we have a gift for you
and for the birth
of baby Melody.

35:17.048 --> 35:18.816
{\an1}Oh, that's sweet.
Thank you.

35:18.883 --> 35:20.384
Open it!

35:20.451 --> 35:23.921
Baby Melody Ray J hat.

35:23.988 --> 35:26.858
{\an1}I'm gonna hold this
very dear to my heart.

35:26.924 --> 35:30.161
So, Ray J, this season,
you said that you cried

35:30.228 --> 35:31.929
a lot more than
you thought you would.

35:31.996 --> 35:33.097
{\an5}When I had Melody?

35:31.996 --> 35:33.097
Yes.

35:33.164 --> 35:34.365
When she had Melody.

35:34.432 --> 35:36.234
When she had Melody, yes.

35:36.300 --> 35:37.635
Yeah, no, I...

35:37.702 --> 35:39.670
Are you more emotional now
that you're a father?

35:39.737 --> 35:41.973
{\an4}I'm not emotional like
what happened when
the baby was born.

35:42.039 --> 35:44.408
{\an4}This was like
a connection that I had
that really just changed

35:44.475 --> 35:47.478
{\an1}my whole mind of how
to move and think and be.

35:47.545 --> 35:49.180
Like an epiphany?

35:49.247 --> 35:52.316
{\an4}'Cause what I just
witnessed and experienced,
it shouldn't be no reason

35:52.383 --> 35:55.419
{\an4}why we should look
down on women or try
to go that hard.

35:55.486 --> 35:56.687
Like, we gotta...

35:56.754 --> 35:58.022
It, like, changed
your whole perspective.

35:58.089 --> 35:59.390
{\an5}Yeah, man, I mean...

35:58.089 --> 35:59.390
Wow!

35:59.457 --> 36:01.926
{\an1}We gotta get better
but we gotta compromise.

36:01.993 --> 36:03.661
{\an8}That's gangsta,
that's gangsta,
that's gangsta.

36:03.728 --> 36:05.496
You got... Kimberly's
over here, crying.

36:05.563 --> 36:09.867
{\an8}That's like a soft spot,
because next month I
finally take these embryos

36:09.934 --> 36:14.272
and I decide if I put
them in me or do a surrogate,

36:14.338 --> 36:18.342
{\an5}so to see that little girl,
that little girl is like
God's gift to...

36:18.409 --> 36:21.245
it's like a motivation and
an inspiration of something

36:21.312 --> 36:25.182
that is really heavy
on me right now.

36:25.249 --> 36:27.618
{\an1}That is beautiful, man.
That's beautiful.

36:27.685 --> 36:29.954
{\an8}You guys are locked in good.
The beanie's good.

36:30.021 --> 36:31.756
{\an8}I like this mature
Ray J, y'all.

36:31.822 --> 36:34.358
(cheers and applause)

36:34.425 --> 36:37.662
{\an5}All right, coming up,
we'll see what happened
when Teairra's new man

36:37.728 --> 36:40.665
tried to take her from
a solo act to a girl group

36:40.731 --> 36:44.335
with own SWV,
Sister Wives with Voices.

36:44.402 --> 36:46.504
We'll be back
right after this.

36:46.571 --> 36:49.373
(cheers and applause)

36:49.440 --> 36:51.108
You're a liar
and a deceiver.

36:51.175 --> 36:53.811
{\an7}I'm all these things
and you're still single.

36:53.878 --> 36:54.912
{\an8}Why would you do that?

36:54.979 --> 36:55.980
{\an8}We not even talking to you.

36:56.047 --> 36:57.048
{\an7}I don't give a (bleep),
bitch.

36:57.114 --> 36:58.115
{\an8}I'm talking to you!

36:58.182 --> 36:59.250
{\an9}Oh!

36:58.182 --> 36:59.250
{\an7}Oh!

36:59.317 --> 37:01.319
{\an8}♪♪

37:04.722 --> 37:05.723
{\an8}♪♪

37:05.790 --> 37:10.394
(cheers and applause)

37:10.461 --> 37:13.631
Welcome back to "Love &amp; Hip Hop
Hollywood: The Reunion."

37:13.698 --> 37:16.801
And now we have a few more faces
to welcome to the stage.

37:16.867 --> 37:19.303
Say hello to Teairra Mari...

37:19.370 --> 37:22.607
{\an8}(cheers and applause)

37:22.673 --> 37:23.774
{\an8}Paris...

37:23.841 --> 37:25.042
{\an8}Akbar...

37:25.109 --> 37:26.243
{\an8}(cheers and applause)

37:26.310 --> 37:28.112
{\an8}Sade...

37:28.179 --> 37:29.547
{\an8}and Alejandra.

37:29.614 --> 37:31.515
Thank you, guys,
and welcome.

37:31.582 --> 37:35.386
{\an5}All right. Now, Teairra
thought she'd found love
under new management

37:35.453 --> 37:37.755
with her latest
boyfriend Akbar,

37:37.822 --> 37:39.690
but when she was thinking
love was a house,

37:39.757 --> 37:43.260
it turned out it was
actually a timeshare.

37:43.327 --> 37:45.363
(laughter)

37:45.429 --> 37:49.600
{\an7}Nikki and Paris bring up
stuff that we had already
talked about,

37:49.667 --> 37:52.503
{\an7}like, with your ex and,
like, you're married and...

37:52.570 --> 37:54.305
{\an8}That's in my past.

37:54.372 --> 37:56.674
{\an8}That's in the past?

37:54.372 --> 37:56.674
{\an9}Yes.

37:56.741 --> 37:59.777
To top the (bleep),
it ain't even just Sade.

37:59.844 --> 38:01.045
There's another female.

38:01.112 --> 38:05.883
Everybody is
together but you.

38:05.950 --> 38:09.387
{\an8}Anybody that wants to
deal with Akbar is gonna
have to go through me.

38:09.453 --> 38:11.722
{\an7}I'm first, she's second,
and if you're dealing

38:11.789 --> 38:13.491
{\an7}with us, bitch,
you're gonna be last.

38:13.557 --> 38:16.794
{\an8}He told me that was it,
so I thought that I
was the only one.

38:16.861 --> 38:19.296
{\an7}No, what you thought
was, he was gonna
leave me for you.

38:19.363 --> 38:20.731
No, I'm out.

38:20.798 --> 38:21.799
Uh-uh, uh-uh!

38:21.866 --> 38:23.901
Bitch! Bitch! (bleep)!

38:23.968 --> 38:27.505
(cheers and applause)

38:27.571 --> 38:29.306
Let's go back
to the beginning.

38:29.373 --> 38:32.977
Teairra, tell me what attracted
you at first to Akbar.

38:33.044 --> 38:36.747
{\an5}I spoke to him,
like, a year before
I went to rehab,

38:36.814 --> 38:38.816
and then,
so we started talking

38:38.883 --> 38:41.952
and he's very charming
or whatever,

38:42.019 --> 38:43.688
so I started
to fall for him.

38:43.754 --> 38:45.523
How did you even
get Akbar number?

38:45.589 --> 38:46.991
You was begging
for his number.

38:47.058 --> 38:49.627
{\an4}I was not begging
for a mother(bleep)
thing, baby.

38:49.694 --> 38:50.928
You better watch your
goddamn tone, bitch.

38:50.995 --> 38:52.263
I ain't got to watch
a mother(bleep) thing.

38:52.329 --> 38:54.198
Watch your mother(bleep)...

38:54.265 --> 38:57.535
{\an5}You're a liar and
a deceiver and a cheater
and a heartbreaker!

38:57.601 --> 39:02.840
Whoa! Hey! Hey!

39:02.907 --> 39:06.243
I'm all these things
and you're still single.

39:06.310 --> 39:08.546
I came into your life
'cause you was broken.

39:08.612 --> 39:10.614
{\an5}I was trying to fix you.

39:08.612 --> 39:10.614
No, actually...

39:10.681 --> 39:12.083
(overlapping chatter)

39:12.149 --> 39:15.019
{\an1}You mother(bleep)
womanizing (bleep)!

39:15.086 --> 39:17.021
{\an4}I appreciate women
that go through
adversity, who been...

39:17.088 --> 39:19.757
{\an5}If you all think he's
a bitch ass (bleep),
raise your hand, please!

39:19.824 --> 39:22.560
{\an1}I appreciate women who've
been through adversity

39:22.626 --> 39:24.161
and all the stuff
they went through.

39:24.228 --> 39:26.263
{\an4}They're the ones
I want, the ones that
everybody count out,

39:26.330 --> 39:28.332
{\an4}the ones that people
call to say that
they smut it out,

39:28.399 --> 39:29.934
{\an1}she a thot,
she ain't nothin'.

39:30.000 --> 39:31.402
So that's what they said
about Sade and Alejandra?

39:31.469 --> 39:32.770
No, no, I said...

39:32.837 --> 39:33.904
All right, so then what
are you talking about?

39:33.971 --> 39:35.106
That's what I want.

39:35.172 --> 39:36.373
{\an1}I want the ones with
no father, none of that.

39:36.440 --> 39:39.610
I'm gonna be your daddy.
I'm gonna be your daddy.

39:39.677 --> 39:42.446
You could never be that.
You could never be that.

39:42.513 --> 39:43.647
{\an1}When I say
I'ma be your daddy,

39:43.714 --> 39:45.382
{\an1}I'ma be your protector,
I'ma be your father,

39:45.449 --> 39:48.486
{\an4}I'm gonna be that
man in your life
that you been missing.

39:48.552 --> 39:51.489
{\an4}Why would you allow
a woman to insert herself
into a situation

39:51.555 --> 39:55.860
{\an5}with other women
that don't respect her?
And also,

39:55.926 --> 39:58.295
{\an4}because of the
vulnerable space that
you've already acknowledged

39:58.362 --> 40:00.798
that she's in, that
they know, as women,

40:00.865 --> 40:04.001
that she's in, and they're
not taking any initiative

40:04.068 --> 40:05.970
to uplift her,
why would you do that?

40:06.036 --> 40:07.605
We not even talking to you.

40:07.671 --> 40:09.140
{\an1}I don't give a (bleep),
bitch. I'm talking to you!

40:09.206 --> 40:16.480
(overlapping shouting)

40:18.749 --> 40:21.452
You're sick.
Get yourself together.

40:21.519 --> 40:23.587
Come again, Akbar?

40:23.654 --> 40:24.989
You can say whatever
you want about me.

40:25.055 --> 40:26.257
The world...
I lay my (bleep) out.

40:26.323 --> 40:29.860
You the one who's a liar
and a manipulator. You.

40:29.927 --> 40:35.566
(overlapping shouting)

40:38.369 --> 40:39.403
{\an3}Oh!

40:38.369 --> 40:39.403
{\an1}Oh!

40:39.470 --> 40:41.405
Whoa, whoa!

40:41.472 --> 40:43.407

40:46.844 --> 40:49.213
{\an8}Next time on "Love &amp; Hip Hop
Hollywood: The Reunion"...

40:49.280 --> 40:52.283
{\an7}I was looking at her when
she actually sent that video.

40:52.349 --> 40:55.085
{\an8}So you're saying you
were with Teairra
when she posted it?

40:55.152 --> 40:57.121
{\an8}You the one who's a liar
and a manipulator.

40:57.188 --> 40:58.455
{\an7}Your (bleep) never
went in me!

40:58.522 --> 41:00.090
{\an8}I would gladly (bleep).

41:00.157 --> 41:01.158
{\an9}Oh!

41:00.157 --> 41:01.158
{\an7}Oh!

41:01.225 --> 41:02.393
{\an8}Do you think Booby
popped up

41:02.459 --> 41:04.995
{\an8}because he's
still in love with Brooke?

41:05.062 --> 41:06.063
{\an8}I'm here alone.

41:06.130 --> 41:07.431
{\an8}Is that Safaree's ring?

41:07.498 --> 41:09.166
{\an8}It is Safaree's ring.
Next question.

41:09.233 --> 41:10.501
{\an8}How you helping people?

41:10.568 --> 41:13.237
{\an7}If I wanted to fight,
you see these (bleep) guns?

41:13.304 --> 41:19.109
{\an8}To have no regard for an
unborn life is not normal.

41:19.176 --> 41:21.545
{\an9}Oh!
