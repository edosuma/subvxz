03:23.537 --> 03:26.636
You girls take the
napkins and the plates.

03:29.584 --> 03:33.058
Out of there. Come on,
go find your mom.

03:40.721 --> 03:42.364
Aunt Lily!

03:43.807 --> 03:45.279
Aunt Lily!

03:47.477 --> 03:51.105
- Would you help me here, please?
- It's not exactly my line, Martha.

03:51.106 --> 03:52.908
- Thank you.
- But all right.

03:55.068 --> 03:56.836
There we are.

04:01.408 --> 04:02.960
Grandma!

04:03.076 --> 04:04.798
Grandma!

04:06.329 --> 04:08.097
Darling!

04:08.498 --> 04:11.000
Grandma, I'm so glad you came.

04:11.001 --> 04:14.726
I could hardly sleep last night,
waiting to see you today.

04:15.213 --> 04:18.673
- Mrs. Tilford, will you excuse me, please?
- Yes, surely.

04:18.675 --> 04:20.067
My!

04:20.510 --> 04:23.220
Your new dress looks
lovely on you, Mary.

04:23.221 --> 04:27.183
- And I must say, you look nice and healthy.
- Healthy?

04:27.184 --> 04:31.520
The way they make you slave around here, I'm
lucky I don't have gray hair and rickets!

04:31.521 --> 04:35.826
- It's all for your own good.
- Everything I hate always is.

04:36.485 --> 04:38.611
Anyway, I'm glad you're here.

04:38.612 --> 04:41.155
- How do you do, Miss Dobie?
- Fine, Miss Wright.

04:41.156 --> 04:43.699
- What do you think of our school?
- I rather like it. And you?

04:43.700 --> 04:46.253
I may be hasty, but I
think it's here to stay.

04:46.620 --> 04:49.413
I think we'll have two or
three new pupils next term.

04:49.414 --> 04:52.625
Martha, it's almost
too good to believe.

04:52.626 --> 04:55.520
Let's not stand here and gloat.

05:01.009 --> 05:02.676
You should have a kitchen helper.

05:02.677 --> 05:05.888
It's just too much to teach all
day, then cook, wash the dishes.

05:05.889 --> 05:09.266
Aunt Lily, 10 minutes is a
long time for one glass.

05:09.267 --> 05:14.448
I do not aim for speed, Martha.
I aim for perfection in life.

05:14.564 --> 05:17.617
Will you try to perfect a few more?

05:19.402 --> 05:21.695
If you'll excuse me, I have
one of my headaches.

05:21.696 --> 05:25.407
I think I'd better go to my room and
prepare for tomorrow's classes.

05:25.408 --> 05:27.493
- Good night.
- Good night.

05:27.494 --> 05:31.594
Sleep well, Aunt Lily, and knit
up the raveled sleeve of care.

05:36.127 --> 05:37.644
Karen...

05:38.588 --> 05:42.049
You know that if I could support her in
any other way, I wouldn't have her here.

05:42.050 --> 05:45.386
She worries you too much. One day,
we'll have enough money to...

05:45.387 --> 05:48.097
Money! I forgot to tell you.

05:48.098 --> 05:51.517
I did the bills, and we're
$90 ahead this month!

05:51.518 --> 05:55.437
- Ahead? I can't believe it!
- It's not much, but it's the first time.

05:55.438 --> 05:57.606
Out of the red, into the black.

05:57.607 --> 05:59.775
- Finally!
- What'll we do with it?

05:59.776 --> 06:02.236
- Save it.
- You need clothes.

06:02.237 --> 06:04.613
- What about you?
- I'm a skirt-and-blouse character.

06:04.614 --> 06:06.949
We're always in style.
But you're not.

06:06.950 --> 06:09.785
You're Fifth Avenue.
Rue de la Paix.

06:09.786 --> 06:13.761
- You need to be kept up.
- Yes, like an old battle monument.

06:13.790 --> 06:14.957
I'm serious.

06:14.958 --> 06:17.727
I remember how you used
to dress in college.

06:17.961 --> 06:21.171
The first time I ever saw you,
running across the quadrangle,

06:21.172 --> 06:22.423
your hair flying.

06:22.424 --> 06:25.352
At the time, I was running
from a chemistry professor.

06:26.136 --> 06:28.530
I remember thinking,
"What a pretty girl."

06:30.765 --> 06:32.600
Time for lights out.

06:32.601 --> 06:35.352
Your turn to crack the whip.
I'll finish up here.

06:35.353 --> 06:39.157
- Hurry back, and we'll take a walk.
- All right, I'd like that.

06:47.115 --> 06:49.408
- All right, girls.
- Already?

06:49.409 --> 06:52.453
Miss Wright, my new ring, it's gone.
I can't find it anywhere.

06:52.454 --> 06:55.748
Don't worry about it.
We'll look for it tomorrow.

06:55.749 --> 06:57.801
All right, bedtime.

06:59.169 --> 07:01.142
Lights out, everyone.

07:07.510 --> 07:08.844
Go ahead and sing.

07:08.845 --> 07:12.056
A woman who sings while she
works is a happy woman.

07:12.057 --> 07:13.682
Who said that?

07:13.683 --> 07:16.518
Joseph Cardin, M.D.
You ever hear of him?

07:16.519 --> 07:19.229
No. Ethical doctors
don't advertise.

07:19.230 --> 07:21.453
Ethical doctors starve.

07:21.524 --> 07:23.859
I thought you were at the
hospital Sunday nights.

07:23.860 --> 07:26.504
I was. I traded with Dr. Mallory.

07:26.780 --> 07:28.030
Sunday for Wednesday?

07:28.031 --> 07:31.175
It's an even swap. They
both have 24 hours.

07:32.994 --> 07:36.343
Why don't you just crawl
in and browse around?

07:40.877 --> 07:43.976
- You know what I did this morning?
- What?

07:44.172 --> 07:46.770
I delivered my 100th baby.

07:47.717 --> 07:49.610
Congratulations.

07:49.719 --> 07:53.023
- How many children do you want, Martha?
- I already have 20.

07:53.431 --> 07:55.028
Upstairs.

07:56.726 --> 07:59.728
- Where's Karen?
- Putting them to bed.

07:59.729 --> 08:01.531
That's good practice.

08:04.275 --> 08:08.455
Why don't you pay tuition? Then you
could eat three meals a day here.

08:09.739 --> 08:13.259
Martha, you've been a little
sharp with me lately.

08:14.744 --> 08:16.261
Have I?

08:18.081 --> 08:19.883
Maybe it's me.

08:25.672 --> 08:27.394
Maybe it is.

08:36.515 --> 08:37.908
Wait.

08:38.268 --> 08:43.073
- Where did you get this book, Mary?
- Hurry up. I've read this page twice!

08:44.482 --> 08:46.204
Okay, turn it.

08:47.402 --> 08:48.919
Wow!

08:49.821 --> 08:51.589
Double wow!

08:59.205 --> 09:01.348
She's headed this way.

09:07.630 --> 09:08.881
How peaceful.

09:08.882 --> 09:11.091
Everybody's studying.

09:11.092 --> 09:13.065
Where's Catherine?

09:16.306 --> 09:19.109
That'll be all for
today, Catherine.

09:20.393 --> 09:22.978
That's last year's
history book, Mary.

09:22.979 --> 09:26.315
I feel funny inside.
I don't know what I'm doing.

09:26.316 --> 09:29.290
- I've got pains.
- Pains?

09:29.402 --> 09:32.000
- I've had them all day.
- Where?

09:32.989 --> 09:34.461
Around.

09:35.784 --> 09:39.828
- Anything I can get you for pains "around"?
- I think I'd better call my grandmother.

09:39.829 --> 09:41.997
Perhaps sleep is the best
thing tonight, Mary.

09:41.998 --> 09:45.250
Tomorrow I'll call Dr. Cardin
and ask him about your pains.

09:45.251 --> 09:46.894
All right?

09:47.337 --> 09:49.230
Catherine, your harness.

09:49.672 --> 09:52.674
Off to sleep, everybody.
Good night.

09:52.675 --> 09:55.728
- Good night, Miss Wright.
- Good night.

09:56.888 --> 09:59.681
"Dr. Cardin" this,
"Dr. Cardin" that.

09:59.682 --> 10:02.351
She always drags him
into the conversation.

10:02.352 --> 10:05.354
After all, she's in love with him.

10:05.355 --> 10:07.106
Then why doesn't she marry him?

10:07.107 --> 10:11.332
I heard him ask her that same
thing once. Downstairs.

10:16.491 --> 10:19.214
I brought your coat. Are you ready?

10:20.495 --> 10:22.388
Look who's here.

10:24.749 --> 10:27.376
- Look who's here!
- Who's here?

10:27.377 --> 10:29.930
You! It's Sunday. What happened?

10:30.130 --> 10:33.382
I killed all the patients and
emptied the joint just for kicks.

10:33.383 --> 10:34.935
Come on.

10:35.468 --> 10:37.136
- But...
- Come on, Martha.

10:37.137 --> 10:41.487
- I'm too tired for two girls.
- Martha and I were going for a walk.

10:42.016 --> 10:43.613
Then go.

10:44.769 --> 10:48.323
You go, Karen. I'm tired.
I have papers to correct.

10:49.816 --> 10:51.914
See you later, Martha.

11:57.926 --> 12:00.854
- Want to go to a movie?
- Nope.

12:01.554 --> 12:04.448
- Walk by the lake?
- Nope.

12:04.933 --> 12:06.610
Have a beer?

12:07.018 --> 12:08.661
Hate beer.

12:10.480 --> 12:12.657
What do you want to do?

12:13.358 --> 12:15.651
Let's try something we've
never done before,

12:15.652 --> 12:18.250
like getting married.

12:19.656 --> 12:23.116
Even after we're married we'll be
saying the same things every night.

12:23.117 --> 12:26.787
- Movies, a walk by the lake...
- I wouldn't like to think that.

12:26.788 --> 12:27.996
No, I wouldn't.

12:27.997 --> 12:31.500
It'd be nice to sit by ourselves
in our own room and...

12:31.501 --> 12:32.584
Read a book.

12:32.585 --> 12:34.307
Read a book?

12:35.505 --> 12:39.341
"Miss Wright, is that what you'll
be doing after you're married?

12:39.342 --> 12:41.440
"Reading books?"

12:42.136 --> 12:44.780
What's the matter with you, Joe?

12:45.139 --> 12:49.142
Same thing that was the matter with
me last week, last month, last year.

12:49.143 --> 12:51.979
You know why we had to wait.
I couldn't leave Martha until...

12:51.980 --> 12:55.204
"...until the school was
on its feet." Yes, I know.

12:55.650 --> 12:58.527
I've never heard you
talk this way before.

12:58.528 --> 13:01.047
Why are you angry tonight?

13:01.364 --> 13:03.166
I don't know.

13:05.118 --> 13:07.170
Why don't you know?

13:13.334 --> 13:15.352
Why don't you know?

13:15.878 --> 13:19.022
People feel the way
they feel, that's all.

13:20.174 --> 13:22.384
I feel lonely, and I feel tired

13:22.385 --> 13:26.096
and I'm sick of plans
for the future.

13:26.097 --> 13:29.474
- Do you feel in love?
- Other people's children.

13:29.475 --> 13:33.780
- I asked you, do you feel in love?
- Don't be cute.

13:35.481 --> 13:39.331
What I'm trying to ask you,
only you talk so much, is...

13:43.072 --> 13:45.966
Can we have a baby
12 months from now?

13:57.587 --> 14:00.731
All right, kid. You got a date.

14:09.098 --> 14:11.150
How I love you.

14:12.935 --> 14:15.112
Love you. Love you. Love you.

15:22.672 --> 15:24.315
Martha,

15:24.757 --> 15:26.508
Joe and I decided tonight.

15:26.509 --> 15:29.779
We're going to be married two
weeks after school lets out.

15:32.181 --> 15:33.778
So soon!

15:33.808 --> 15:36.327
It doesn't seem so soon to Joe.

15:37.019 --> 15:39.321
No, I suppose it doesn't.

15:42.358 --> 15:44.126
Congratulations.

15:44.444 --> 15:47.042
Wouldn't it be nice to have the
wedding right here at the school?

15:47.697 --> 15:50.170
The garden will be in full
bloom and the roses out.

15:50.741 --> 15:53.294
We could put up a
candstriped awning.

15:55.079 --> 15:57.632
And then good-bye,
Wright-Dobie school.

15:58.541 --> 16:01.877
My marriage isn't going to make
any difference to the school.

16:01.878 --> 16:05.380
It will, Karen. You know
it will. It can't help it.

16:05.381 --> 16:09.050
You keep saying things like that.
We've talked about all this before.

16:09.051 --> 16:13.054
You know Joe isn't asking me to give
it up, and I'm not going to leave.

16:13.055 --> 16:16.825
No, of course not. I don't know
what I could be thinking of.

16:32.074 --> 16:34.172
I don't understand you!

16:34.285 --> 16:36.244
It's been so hard
building this place up.

16:36.245 --> 16:40.721
Just when we're getting on our feet you're
ready to let it all go right to hell!

16:55.264 --> 16:59.100
Martha, for God's sake, do you
expect me to give up my marriage?

16:59.101 --> 17:00.402
No.

17:01.771 --> 17:05.415
No, of course not.
I'm sorry, Karen.

17:05.608 --> 17:08.582
I don't know how I
could be so selfish.

17:08.778 --> 17:10.876
Please, forgive me.

17:12.698 --> 17:14.545
I already have.

17:16.618 --> 17:20.138
It's been a long day. We
both need some sleep.

17:21.457 --> 17:23.458
Yes, you're right.

17:23.459 --> 17:25.835
Who has the cooking
detail for breakfast?

17:25.836 --> 17:27.262
I do.

17:31.425 --> 17:32.942
Karen...

17:33.469 --> 17:37.148
you know, don't you, that I
only want the best for you?

17:40.476 --> 17:41.948
I know.

18:19.640 --> 18:21.641
"This proves me base,

18:21.642 --> 18:24.311
"if she first meet
the curled Antony

18:24.312 --> 18:27.439
"he'll make demands of
her, and spend that kiss

18:27.440 --> 18:29.566
- "which is my heaven..."
- Evelyn. Evelyn.

18:29.567 --> 18:34.168
Can't you imagine yourself as
Cleopatra talking to an asp?

18:42.204 --> 18:44.247
"This knot intrinsicate

18:44.248 --> 18:46.875
"of life at once untie.

18:46.876 --> 18:49.085
"Poor venomous fool.

18:49.086 --> 18:51.434
- "Be angry, and dispatch..."
- Mary!

18:51.672 --> 18:54.841
Why, Mary, are you just arriving
for your elocution class?

18:54.842 --> 18:58.191
If you take no interest
in your work, then...

18:58.804 --> 19:01.181
I went to get these flowers
for you, Mrs. Mortar.

19:01.182 --> 19:04.768
You told us you loved flowers. And I
walked so far to get them for you.

19:04.769 --> 19:07.618
That was very thoughtful
of you, Mary.

19:07.897 --> 19:10.899
I suppose I'll have to
forgive you this time.

19:10.900 --> 19:13.652
Thoughtfulness and
courtesy mean breeding

19:13.653 --> 19:15.737
and breeding is an excellent thing.

19:15.738 --> 19:18.406
I think you should write
that down, all of you.

19:18.407 --> 19:20.709
We wrote it down last week.

19:21.243 --> 19:24.888
- Put them in a vase for me, Mary.
- Yes, ma'am.

19:24.914 --> 19:27.342
Good afternoon, Miss Wright.

19:27.500 --> 19:30.585
Evelyn has just been
reading Cleopatra for us.

19:30.586 --> 19:32.337
That's nice.

19:32.338 --> 19:35.562
Mary just brought me a
gift of some flowers.

19:35.591 --> 19:39.646
- Where did you get them, Mary?
- She picked them, especially for me.

19:41.764 --> 19:44.237
Where did you get them, Mary?

19:45.643 --> 19:47.411
Down near the lake.

19:48.604 --> 19:50.076
I see.

19:51.440 --> 19:54.084
That'll be all, girls. Thank you.

19:56.153 --> 19:58.697
- Mary?
- I have to get my biology book for...

19:58.698 --> 20:00.921
I'd rather you waited.

20:01.200 --> 20:04.119
It wasn't necessary to go down
to the lake for those flowers.

20:04.120 --> 20:07.664
There was a bunch exactly like these
in the trash barrels this morning.

20:07.665 --> 20:10.138
What a nasty thing to do!

20:10.292 --> 20:12.390
What a nasty thing.

20:14.171 --> 20:15.597
Come.

20:15.840 --> 20:17.813
Come and sit down.

20:20.344 --> 20:23.471
Mary, why do you do these things?

20:23.472 --> 20:25.274
Why do you lie to us so often?

20:25.808 --> 20:27.576
I'm not lying.

20:27.601 --> 20:32.953
If you have to do things to let off steam or
for adventure, come and tell us about it.

20:34.650 --> 20:38.204
Tell us the truth. I promise
you, we'll try to understand.

20:42.616 --> 20:45.795
I picked the flowers
down near the lake.

20:59.341 --> 21:02.594
All right, you leave me no choice.
You'll have to be punished.

21:02.595 --> 21:05.930
Take your recreation periods alone.
No field hockey, no swimming

21:05.931 --> 21:08.683
and do not leave the school grounds
for any reason whatsoever.

21:08.684 --> 21:10.852
- Saturday, too'?
- Saturday, too.

21:10.853 --> 21:13.688
But the boat races are Saturday,
and you said I could go.

21:13.689 --> 21:16.024
The boat races were a
privilege which you've lost.

21:16.025 --> 21:18.026
I'll tell my grandmother how...

21:18.027 --> 21:20.320
- Go upstairs.
- I'll tell her how you treat me.

21:20.321 --> 21:22.248
Go upstairs, Mary!

21:26.410 --> 21:28.383
I don't feel well.

21:29.497 --> 21:30.969
I've got a pain.

21:33.459 --> 21:35.261
It hurts here.

21:35.878 --> 21:38.226
I've never had it before!

21:38.380 --> 21:41.382
My heart! It's
stopping or something!

21:41.383 --> 21:43.718
I can't breathe! I can't!

21:43.719 --> 21:45.362
I can't!

21:53.813 --> 21:55.271
It's nothing.

21:55.272 --> 21:57.732
You'd better telephone Joe
and ask him to come over.

21:57.733 --> 21:59.376
All right.

22:00.778 --> 22:04.364
- What happened? Did she fall?
- No. I was disciplining her and...

22:04.365 --> 22:07.075
- And you finally hit her?
- No, of course not.

22:07.076 --> 22:10.995
- She just seems to have fainted.
- Maybe it's a heart attack.

22:10.996 --> 22:14.391
Now, I think the feet should
be higher than the head.

22:17.378 --> 22:20.004
- Try it here.
- Where?

22:20.005 --> 22:22.215
- Here. Here.
- There?

22:22.216 --> 22:24.610
Yes, there, a most important spot.

22:25.386 --> 22:26.886
Yes, indeed.

22:26.887 --> 22:29.264
When Delia Lambert had a
heart attack in Buffalo

22:29.265 --> 22:32.267
right on the stage,
that was the spot.

22:32.268 --> 22:35.728
- Did this Delia survive?
- Yes. I saved her.

22:35.729 --> 22:37.272
How's her pulse?

22:37.273 --> 22:39.621
The pulse is very bad.

22:40.526 --> 22:44.153
I'm afraid she's slipping away.
There's no heartbeat at all.

22:44.154 --> 22:45.780
We'll need a specialist.

22:45.781 --> 22:48.616
Perhaps you, Doctor, would
condescend to take over?

22:48.617 --> 22:49.951
What?

22:49.952 --> 22:51.911
Heart attacks are
nothing to play with.

22:51.912 --> 22:54.956
- Never played with one in my life.
- As the child's teacher, I...

22:54.957 --> 22:57.009
Mrs. Mortar, please.

23:07.386 --> 23:08.803
Well!

23:08.804 --> 23:11.732
I was practically put
out of the room.

23:14.143 --> 23:17.228
So you don't resent your aunt
being snubbed and humiliated?

23:17.229 --> 23:20.148
- Aunt Lily.
- Karen is rude to me, and you know it.

23:20.149 --> 23:23.985
Karen is very kind to you. And
what's even harder, very patient.

23:23.986 --> 23:25.236
Patient with me?

23:25.237 --> 23:28.197
When I've worked my fingers
to the bone for both of you.

23:28.198 --> 23:31.217
Yes, to the bone, to the very bone!

23:34.496 --> 23:36.173
Aunt Lily...

23:37.041 --> 23:40.811
You've talked about going back
to New York for a long time now.

23:40.920 --> 23:45.548
It's been years. I'll never
live to play on Broadway again.

23:45.549 --> 23:49.274
But you will, Aunt Lily, you will.
You can go back to New York.

23:50.012 --> 23:51.179
You want to get rid of me?

23:51.180 --> 23:53.848
I'm trying to give you something
you've always wanted.

23:53.849 --> 23:55.516
You keep talking about the theater

23:55.517 --> 23:58.686
and the great opportunities in
television that you're missing.

23:58.687 --> 24:01.856
Turning me out.
Nice, grateful girls.

24:01.857 --> 24:07.129
- How can anybody deal with you?
- Please, do not raise your voice.

24:07.363 --> 24:11.616
I shall write to my agent. When
they have a suitable part for me...

24:11.617 --> 24:12.992
No.

24:12.993 --> 24:14.827
I don't think we
should wait that long.

24:14.828 --> 24:17.080
I'll give you what little
money we have now.

24:17.081 --> 24:21.542
You think I'd take your money?
I'd rather scrub floors first.

24:21.543 --> 24:24.847
You'll change your mind
after the first floor.

24:25.839 --> 24:29.008
I should have known by this
time that the wise thing to do

24:29.009 --> 24:32.279
was to stay out of your way
when he's in the house.

24:34.723 --> 24:36.525
When who's in the house?

24:36.892 --> 24:38.893
Don't think you're
fooling me, young lady.

24:38.894 --> 24:42.539
Any day that he's in the
house is a bad day.

24:44.566 --> 24:46.209
Now, look...

24:48.570 --> 24:53.032
Let's give it up. I'm tired. I've
been working since 6:00 this morning.

24:53.033 --> 24:54.659
I know what I know.

24:54.660 --> 24:58.079
You can't stand them being together,
and you're taking it out on me.

24:58.080 --> 25:00.915
God knows what you'll
do when they marry.

25:00.916 --> 25:03.042
- Jealous, jealous...
- Aunt Lily.

25:03.043 --> 25:06.421
You've always had a jealous,
possessive nature even as a child.

25:06.422 --> 25:09.424
If you had a friend, you'd be
upset if she liked anybody else.

25:09.425 --> 25:11.259
And that's what's happening now.

25:11.260 --> 25:13.928
And it's unnatural. It's just
as unnatural as it can be.

25:13.929 --> 25:18.474
The sooner you get out of here, the better.
You are making me sick.

25:18.475 --> 25:22.996
And I won't stand for you any longer.
I want you to leave tomorrow, no delays.

25:32.489 --> 25:33.948
What are you doing down here?

25:33.949 --> 25:35.842
- We just came to...
- I was going up...

25:36.577 --> 25:41.205
- I was going upstairs.
- We just came down to see how Mary was.

25:41.206 --> 25:43.624
I think you came down
to listen deliberately.

25:43.625 --> 25:45.501
We didn't mean to.

25:45.502 --> 25:49.648
Eavesdropping is something that
nice young ladies just don't do.

25:50.632 --> 25:54.106
You wait outside in the hall.
I'll talk to you later.

25:56.972 --> 25:58.848
You should not be around children.

25:58.849 --> 26:01.309
When you're at your best,
you're not for tender ears.

26:01.310 --> 26:03.144
So now it's my fault, is it?

26:03.145 --> 26:04.604
You'd better look to yourself

26:04.605 --> 26:07.624
and not continue to blame
me for everything.

26:17.826 --> 26:19.911
What's the matter with the duchess?

26:19.912 --> 26:22.997
Rehearsing an exit in case
she finds the right play.

26:22.998 --> 26:25.416
- How's Mary?
- Strong as a mule.

26:25.417 --> 26:28.419
I don't know who's teaching
fainting here, but she flunked.

26:28.420 --> 26:30.838
We've about reached the end
of our rope with that child.

26:30.839 --> 26:33.049
Someone should talk to
Mrs. Tilford about Mary.

26:33.050 --> 26:36.094
- You wouldn't be electing me, would you?
- She's your aunt.

26:36.095 --> 26:39.430
Yes, but I'm not writing the
Tilfords into the marriage contract.

26:39.431 --> 26:42.683
Incidentally, did Karen tell
you she finally set a date?

26:42.684 --> 26:46.158
She told me, incidentally.

26:46.188 --> 26:48.866
- What's the matter, Martha?
- Nothing.

26:50.984 --> 26:52.860
I think there is.

26:52.861 --> 26:56.405
I don't know what's bothering you.
I always thought you approved of me.

26:56.406 --> 26:58.366
You must know how fond I am of you.

26:58.367 --> 27:00.618
If it's the school you're
worried about, don't.

27:00.619 --> 27:03.047
- Karen knows I have...
- Damn you! Leave me alone!

27:06.125 --> 27:08.348
Stop consoling me, or...

27:08.877 --> 27:13.381
patronizing me, or feeling sorry for
me, or whatever it is you're doing.

27:13.382 --> 27:15.229
Leave me alone!

27:20.389 --> 27:23.391
The angel child is just
coming back to life.

27:23.392 --> 27:26.060
Her roommates were busily
eavesdropping at the door

27:26.061 --> 27:29.035
when Aunt Lily and I were
yelling at each other.

27:29.731 --> 27:31.248
Karen...

27:31.567 --> 27:33.985
I think we should separate
those girls from Mary.

27:33.986 --> 27:36.505
Yes. She's a bad influence.

27:37.489 --> 27:40.741
- I have a class waiting. They're outside.
- I'll take care of it.

27:40.742 --> 27:42.715
All right, girls,
you may go in now.

27:46.248 --> 27:48.416
How does it feel to be
back from the grave?

27:48.417 --> 27:52.142
- Did you meet any interesting people?
- It's my heart, and it hurts.

27:52.212 --> 27:54.560
You like that story, don't you?

27:56.508 --> 28:00.011
- I want to see my grandmother.
- We're awfully sorry, Miss Wright.

28:00.012 --> 28:03.264
I'm sorry, too. You never
used to do things like that.

28:03.265 --> 28:05.766
I'm afraid we're going to
have to separate you girls.

28:05.767 --> 28:07.935
Peggy, move into
Helen Burton's room,

28:07.936 --> 28:10.739
and Mary, change rooms
with Rosalie Wells.

28:10.856 --> 28:13.983
- Miss Wright.
- And it's just because I had a pain.

28:13.984 --> 28:15.735
You're always being mean to me.

28:15.736 --> 28:18.112
I'm always getting
punished, picked on,

28:18.113 --> 28:21.087
blamed for everything
that happens around here!

28:21.116 --> 28:22.417
Tell Rosalie.

28:39.134 --> 28:40.606
Help!

28:45.933 --> 28:47.860
Are you leaving?

28:48.185 --> 28:50.283
Not until I get paid.

29:15.879 --> 29:18.807
- Good-bye, teacher.
- Good-bye, Doctor.

29:59.881 --> 30:03.551
Now, go on. Why did Dobie
want to get rid of Mortar?

30:03.552 --> 30:06.929
Dr. Cardin and Miss Wright
are going to get married.

30:06.930 --> 30:10.808
- Everybody knows that. Stupid!
- But everybody doesn't know

30:10.809 --> 30:13.728
that Miss Dobie doesn't
want them to get married.

30:13.729 --> 30:16.564
- How do you like that?
- Why doesn't she?

30:16.565 --> 30:20.735
I don't know, but Mortar
said that Dobie was jealous

30:20.736 --> 30:23.863
and that she was like that
when she was a little girl

30:23.864 --> 30:27.116
and she never wanted anybody
to like Miss Wright

30:27.117 --> 30:28.743
and that was unnatural.

30:28.744 --> 30:31.388
Boy, did Dobie get sore at that.

30:32.789 --> 30:34.957
What did she mean by unnatural?

30:34.958 --> 30:36.500
"Unnatural."

30:36.501 --> 30:39.224
"Un" for "not." Not natural.

30:39.421 --> 30:42.144
Then genius here dropped her book.

30:47.721 --> 30:50.740
- What are you doing?
- My bracelet.

30:50.974 --> 30:53.743
I still can't find it.

30:53.852 --> 30:57.271
I don't like that Mary
Tilford coming in here.

30:57.272 --> 31:02.203
- Come here, Sylvester. We're moving.
- Peggy says she blows her nose all night.

31:18.960 --> 31:21.462
- I need $2.
- I don't have it.

31:21.463 --> 31:24.799
You have $2.75. Get it for me.

31:24.800 --> 31:27.194
No, I won't get it for you.

31:27.969 --> 31:30.054
Get it for me.

31:30.055 --> 31:32.056
- I won't!
- Get it for me!

31:32.057 --> 31:34.701
- Let go of my hand!
- Get it for me!

31:38.146 --> 31:39.230
Girls!

31:39.231 --> 31:41.315
What are you making
all this fuss about?

31:41.316 --> 31:43.067
I shall get one of my headaches.

31:43.068 --> 31:45.820
I'm very upset today, with
all my packing and moving

31:45.821 --> 31:48.374
and I cannot stand this noise.

31:49.616 --> 31:53.136
Isn't that Helen Burton's
bracelet, the one that was lost?

31:54.830 --> 31:56.222
I...

31:56.581 --> 31:58.258
No, ma'am.

31:58.750 --> 32:01.678
It's Rosalie's bracelet.
You dropped it.

32:02.421 --> 32:05.645
In my day, children were
seen and not heard.

32:05.882 --> 32:07.855
Try and be ladies.

32:14.349 --> 32:16.026
Rosalie!

32:22.858 --> 32:25.377
Now will you get me the money?

32:39.958 --> 32:41.885
Keep the change.

33:01.354 --> 33:03.372
I'm sorry, grandma.

33:09.738 --> 33:12.541
I didn't mean to
hurt your feelings.

33:18.246 --> 33:19.889
Forgive me?

33:19.915 --> 33:23.059
What made you act that
way, run away like that?

33:23.460 --> 33:25.085
I told you.

33:25.086 --> 33:27.838
- I'm scared of them.
- Nonsense!

33:27.839 --> 33:31.342
- They've got something against me.
- I don't believe that.

33:31.343 --> 33:34.762
They're always punishing me for
anything they can think of.

33:34.763 --> 33:36.138
You imagine it.

33:36.139 --> 33:38.891
Miss Wright and Miss Dobie
are nice young women

33:38.892 --> 33:40.865
and good teachers.

33:40.977 --> 33:44.121
You don't know anything
about them. I do.

33:45.774 --> 33:47.951
I know lots of things.

33:49.736 --> 33:52.209
Like what happened yesterday.

33:52.280 --> 33:54.503
What happened yesterday?

33:55.158 --> 33:57.756
- I can't tell you.
- Why?

33:58.036 --> 34:02.091
- Because you're going to take their part.
- Very well, then.

34:03.124 --> 34:05.709
It was all about Miss
Dobie and Mrs. Mortar.

34:05.710 --> 34:10.172
They were having a terrible argument,
and Peggy and Evelyn heard them

34:10.172 --> 34:12.049
and Miss Dobie found out.

34:12.050 --> 34:14.217
That's why they're making
us change our rooms.

34:14.219 --> 34:16.387
What's wrong with that?

34:16.388 --> 34:20.139
They don't like to have us near them.
They've got secrets or something.

34:20.141 --> 34:23.310
There's nothing wrong with
people having secrets.

34:23.311 --> 34:25.784
But these were funny secrets.

34:27.857 --> 34:32.458
Peggy and Evelyn heard Mrs. Mortar
say that she knew what was going on.

34:32.612 --> 34:35.197
And they were talking
about all sorts of things

34:35.197 --> 34:38.877
about Miss Wright and
cousin Joe getting married

34:38.994 --> 34:41.797
and how Miss Dobie was jealous.

34:42.330 --> 34:44.623
And boy, did Dobie
get sore at that.

34:44.623 --> 34:47.418
I don't wish to hear anymore
of this ugly gossip.

34:47.418 --> 34:52.270
Besides, I don't believe this talk of
jealousy between Miss Dobie and Miss Wright.

34:56.052 --> 34:59.481
But I didn't say she was
jealous of Miss Wright.

35:02.058 --> 35:05.519
I said that Mrs. Mortar said

35:05.520 --> 35:08.664
that Miss Dobie was
jealous of cousin Joe.

35:10.317 --> 35:12.369
I don't understand.

35:12.527 --> 35:14.236
Neither do I.

35:14.237 --> 35:17.197
But Mrs. Mortar said
that it was unnatural

35:17.198 --> 35:19.671
for a woman to feel that way.

35:20.535 --> 35:23.287
I'm just telling you what she said.

35:23.288 --> 35:25.914
Mrs. Mortar said that
Miss Dobie was like that

35:25.915 --> 35:29.043
even when she was a little
girl, that it was unnatural.

35:29.044 --> 35:31.712
Stop using that silly word.

35:31.713 --> 35:33.464
That's the word she used.

35:33.465 --> 35:35.215
Then they got mad at each other

35:35.216 --> 35:38.344
and Miss Dobie told Mrs. Mortar
to get out of the house.

35:38.345 --> 35:41.639
- That probably wasn't the reason at all.
- I bet it was.

35:41.640 --> 35:44.391
Because, honestly, Miss Dobie
does get mean and cranky

35:44.392 --> 35:46.060
every time cousin Joe comes.

35:46.061 --> 35:48.812
And yesterday I heard her
say to him, "Damn you."

35:48.813 --> 35:51.482
You've picked up some very
fine words, haven't you?

35:51.483 --> 35:54.151
But that's just the word she used.

35:54.152 --> 35:57.905
One time, Miss Dobie
was in her room late.

35:57.906 --> 35:59.490
It's right near ours.

35:59.491 --> 36:02.117
And Miss Wright goes in
there almost every night

36:02.118 --> 36:03.869
and stays late.

36:03.870 --> 36:07.081
That's why they want to get
rid of us. Of me, I mean.

36:07.082 --> 36:08.415
Because we hear things.

36:08.416 --> 36:11.686
That's why they're making
us move our rooms.

36:15.715 --> 36:18.143
I've heard other things, too.

36:18.259 --> 36:22.063
Plenty of other things.
Strange, funny noises.

36:23.181 --> 36:26.906
- And we've seen things, too.
- What things?

36:27.102 --> 36:30.145
- Bad things. I can't tell you.
- You're annoying me very much.

36:30.146 --> 36:31.939
If you have anything
to say, say it.

36:31.940 --> 36:34.775
I mean, I can't say it out loud.
I've got to whisper it.

36:34.776 --> 36:38.922
- Why must you whisper it?
- I don't know. I've just got to.

36:45.078 --> 36:47.927
Mary, do you know
what you're saying?

36:51.251 --> 36:53.269
Stop the car, John.

36:53.336 --> 36:55.183
Stop the car, John!

37:11.855 --> 37:13.657
Just a moment.

37:22.073 --> 37:23.716
It's true.

37:34.043 --> 37:35.560
You wait right here.

38:10.872 --> 38:12.344
MY goodness!

38:18.546 --> 38:20.631
Good morning, Mrs. Tilford.

38:20.632 --> 38:23.008
I've come here to see Miss
Wright or Miss Dobie.

38:23.009 --> 38:28.236
They're in class. I never carried
a suitcase before in my life.

38:29.349 --> 38:30.866
Oh, dear.

38:32.310 --> 38:33.953
I'll wait.

38:34.562 --> 38:38.662
I guess I'd better cram
these things into this bag.

38:38.817 --> 38:42.152
My theater maid usually
does the packing for me.

38:42.153 --> 38:44.626
What must I look like?

38:44.906 --> 38:48.659
I gave up a very important role in
Morning Sunshine just to teach here.

38:48.660 --> 38:51.203
And now my niece has dismissed me.

38:51.204 --> 38:55.475
Dismissed, after a year
of backbreaking work.

38:58.753 --> 39:00.921
I sacrificed my youth for her

39:00.922 --> 39:04.132
but I'm sure you
know all about that,

39:04.133 --> 39:06.231
and ingratitude,

39:06.594 --> 39:08.862
and the sting of the wasp.

39:11.307 --> 39:14.768
Do you suppose I could get one of
those coats in that other bag?

39:14.769 --> 39:16.446
Mrs. Mortar...

39:16.646 --> 39:21.497
I've been told you used a strange
word in connection with your niece.

39:21.693 --> 39:24.653
I've heard that you feel
there's something unnatural...

39:24.654 --> 39:27.281
Something unnatural? Why, the
whole thing's unnatural.

39:27.282 --> 39:30.617
You would think that a healthy
woman her age would have a husband

39:30.618 --> 39:34.329
or at least an admirer but she
hasn't, and she never has had.

39:34.330 --> 39:36.957
Young men who liked her,
yes, but not for long,

39:36.958 --> 39:41.211
because she has no interest
in them, only the school

39:41.212 --> 39:43.355
and Karen Wright.

39:46.885 --> 39:50.679
Mrs. Tilford, at 28, do you spend your
life with other people's children

39:50.680 --> 39:54.016
no new clothes, working every
night, nothing to look forward to

39:54.017 --> 39:56.143
but a summer vacation
with Karen Wright?

39:56.144 --> 39:59.855
And now that Karen's getting married,
Martha's in a frenzy of bad temper

39:59.856 --> 40:01.982
and she's taking it out on me.

40:01.983 --> 40:06.789
Friendship between women, yes.
Nobody's had more friends than I.

40:07.405 --> 40:09.799
But not this insane devotion.

40:12.327 --> 40:15.579
I'm forgetting
something, my umbrella.

40:15.580 --> 40:17.803
I left it in the closet.

40:19.918 --> 40:22.586
Perhaps it's all for the best.

40:22.587 --> 40:25.422
It was bound to happen
sooner or later.

40:25.423 --> 40:27.341
I couldn't have stood
it much longer.

40:27.342 --> 40:31.637
Here it is. Anyway, one
shouldn't be away too long

40:31.638 --> 40:33.940
from his true profession.

40:34.265 --> 40:38.115
My make-up case. I left it
upstairs. I'll be right back.

40:43.358 --> 40:46.502
- Drive back to the house, John.
- Yes, ma'am.

41:01.960 --> 41:05.514
- I don't have to go back today?
- No.

41:05.922 --> 41:07.599
This week?

41:07.715 --> 41:10.518
No, Mary, you don't
have to go back.

41:11.094 --> 41:12.520
Ever?

41:12.762 --> 41:14.188
Ever.

41:17.976 --> 41:22.747
You're the nicest, sweetest
grandmother in the whole wide world.

41:43.876 --> 41:48.101
John, please stop at
Mrs. Anderson's house.

42:52.153 --> 42:54.821
Catherine, will you
please continue?

42:54.822 --> 42:58.251
Rosalie, will you come
outside with me a moment?

43:00.578 --> 43:02.346
Go ahead, Catherine.

43:14.550 --> 43:17.803
Rosalie, your mother
has sent us a message

43:17.804 --> 43:21.223
that you're to pack a bag and
spend the night at the Tilfords'.

43:21.224 --> 43:24.323
- John will drive you.
- Why?

43:26.395 --> 43:29.022
I'm sure it's nothing to
be upset about, dear.

43:29.023 --> 43:30.857
Your mother's been
away and very likely

43:30.858 --> 43:33.661
just wants to see you as
soon as she gets back.

43:34.112 --> 43:36.631
John's outside. Don't
keep him waiting.

43:38.533 --> 43:40.426
Yes, Miss Dobie.

43:43.246 --> 43:45.497
I'm going to ask it, too. Why?

43:45.498 --> 43:49.209
First Mary doesn't come
back. Now Rosalie?

43:49.210 --> 43:51.763
I don't know. I just don't...

43:55.091 --> 43:57.189
Another car's coming.

44:06.060 --> 44:08.436
Rosalie Wells is here to
spend the night with you.

44:08.437 --> 44:10.355
- What?
- Till her mother comes for her.

44:10.356 --> 44:14.442
- You mean, she's going to sleep here?
- If you don't keep her awake all night.

44:14.443 --> 44:15.527
Why?

44:15.528 --> 44:18.738
How do I know the crazy things
that are going on in this house?

44:18.739 --> 44:20.837
All right, come on in, Rosalie.

44:22.076 --> 44:25.328
- Have you had your bath, dear?
- Yes, ma'am, this morning.

44:25.329 --> 44:28.623
Better have another. I'll be
in later to make up your bed.

44:28.624 --> 44:32.053
And if you need anything,
you just let me know.

44:38.676 --> 44:40.102
Sissy!

44:52.940 --> 44:56.860
But, Mrs. Walton, there must
be a reason. You don't...

44:56.861 --> 45:00.916
- Mrs. Vincent, won't you please tell us...
- Come along, now.

45:07.914 --> 45:09.591
She hung up.

45:13.294 --> 45:17.599
- Did you get Joe?
- No. I tried twice. He's out on a call.

45:23.095 --> 45:26.139
- Miss Janet.
- Are we coming back, Miss Dobie?

45:26.140 --> 45:27.224
I don't know, dear.

45:27.225 --> 45:29.476
All the girls leaving,
it's all so funny.

45:29.477 --> 45:31.645
Come along. Your mother
wants you to hurry.

45:31.646 --> 45:34.481
- Didn't Mrs. Webb leave us a message?
- Yes, ma'am.

45:34.482 --> 45:37.400
She said have Janet's trunk
packed, and I'll pick it up.

45:37.401 --> 45:40.830
- That's all she told you?
- Yes, ma'am, that's all.

45:43.032 --> 45:45.300
Mr. Burton, don't you...

45:49.372 --> 45:53.427
What is happening here?
Has everyone gone insane?

46:00.341 --> 46:03.260
- I'm awfully sorry to leave, Miss Wright.
- Come on, Helen.

46:03.261 --> 46:07.441
- We're sorry, too, Helen.
- Thank you. Good-bye.

46:08.182 --> 46:10.610
Go on out to the car, Helen.

46:13.854 --> 46:16.064
How much do I owe you for
the rest of the term?

46:16.065 --> 46:20.336
We don't want your money, Mr. Burton.
We want to know why all this is happening.

46:20.361 --> 46:22.362
If you don't know, I don't know.

46:22.363 --> 46:26.199
You mean, you're taking your child out
of school and you don't know why?

46:26.200 --> 46:28.201
It'd be better if you
talk to Helen's mother.

46:28.202 --> 46:29.369
Why?

46:29.370 --> 46:31.843
It's not the kind of thing
I want to talk about!

46:35.293 --> 46:36.970
Mr. Burton!

46:38.004 --> 46:40.727
Mr. Burton, you've got to tell us.

47:38.856 --> 47:43.878
What would you say if I told you that
I knew why you were leaving school?

47:44.612 --> 47:47.447
You're always pretending
you know everything.

47:47.448 --> 47:49.574
You and your silly secrets.

47:49.575 --> 47:54.079
Suppose I told someone it all happened
because you told me something.

47:54.080 --> 47:55.427
Me?

47:55.790 --> 47:58.468
I don't know anything to tell you.

47:59.210 --> 48:02.138
That's not what I
told my grandmother.

48:02.797 --> 48:04.714
Why, Mary Tilford.

48:04.715 --> 48:06.508
I didn't tell you anything.

48:06.509 --> 48:10.512
I'm going right down to your grandmother
and tell her I didn't tell you anything...

48:10.513 --> 48:11.930
Whatever it is.

48:11.931 --> 48:14.984
You're just trying
to get me into...

48:20.648 --> 48:22.825
Why don't you go?

48:23.025 --> 48:25.652
Wait a minute. I'll come with you.

48:25.653 --> 48:29.173
- What for?
- I want to tell her all about this.

48:29.615 --> 48:33.660
- What about it?
- Just that you stole it from Helen Burton.

48:33.661 --> 48:36.996
I never did any such
thing. I borrowed it.

48:36.997 --> 48:40.458
And I was going to put it back as
soon as I'd worn it to the movies.

48:40.459 --> 48:42.460
I never meant to keep it.

48:42.461 --> 48:45.588
I was putting it back yesterday
when you made me drop it.

48:45.589 --> 48:48.383
And who do you think
will believe that?

48:48.384 --> 48:50.468
And if I told my grandmother

48:50.469 --> 48:53.847
she'd tell your parents and
everybody at the school

48:53.848 --> 48:56.766
and the police, of course,
that you're a thief!

48:56.767 --> 48:59.519
And you'd be put in a school
for delinquent girls.

48:59.520 --> 49:03.324
Mary, don't tell anybody!
Please, don't tell!

49:04.608 --> 49:06.000
See?

49:06.777 --> 49:08.445
Whatever you ask, I do.

49:08.446 --> 49:12.046
Wild horses couldn't drag
the secret out of me now.

49:12.366 --> 49:15.743
- Thank you, Mary.
- As long as you do what I say.

49:15.744 --> 49:18.012
Want to join my sorority?

49:18.581 --> 49:21.350
Yes, I think so.

49:21.417 --> 49:25.211
Put your hand on your heart,
and take the oath of allegiance.

49:25.212 --> 49:26.754
"I, Rosalie Wells,

49:26.755 --> 49:29.632
"am now a member of
the inner circle."

49:29.633 --> 49:31.801
I, Rosalie Wells,

49:31.802 --> 49:34.888
am now a member of
the inner circle.

49:34.889 --> 49:37.724
"I will never betray
a sister member."

49:37.725 --> 49:41.495
I will never betray
a sister member.

49:41.812 --> 49:44.647
- Hello, Amelia.
- Good evening, Joseph.

49:44.648 --> 49:46.357
How are you?

49:46.358 --> 49:47.400
Tired.

49:47.401 --> 49:50.250
We're getting the results of
the mating season about now.

49:50.696 --> 49:53.072
Did I take you away from a patient?

49:53.073 --> 49:55.950
No. I was just finishing
at the hospital.

49:55.951 --> 49:58.424
I told you that on the phone.

49:58.913 --> 50:00.760
Yes, of course.

50:01.874 --> 50:03.958
How is the hospital?

50:03.959 --> 50:06.419
- How is it getting on?
- Just the same.

50:06.420 --> 50:08.893
Not enough money, badly equipped.

50:08.923 --> 50:11.799
Amelia, you didn't call me here
to talk about the hospital.

50:11.800 --> 50:14.319
What's the matter?
Aren't you feeling well?

50:14.720 --> 50:17.489
If I only knew how to start.

50:18.057 --> 50:20.405
Start at the easiest place.

50:20.559 --> 50:23.078
It's a very hard thing to say.

50:23.437 --> 50:25.114
Hard for you to say to me?

50:27.608 --> 50:31.528
Did you know they dismissed Mrs. Mortar
from the Wright-Dobie school?

50:31.529 --> 50:34.503
They did? Good. It's about time.

50:35.449 --> 50:38.451
Don't you think it odd they
wanted so much to get rid

50:38.452 --> 50:40.800
of that silly, harmless woman?

50:40.913 --> 50:45.250
Lily Mortar is not a harmless woman,
though God knows she's silly enough.

50:45.251 --> 50:47.460
She's a selfish old bore.

50:47.461 --> 50:50.213
If you're feeling sorry for
her, you're wasting your time.

50:50.214 --> 50:52.937
- You didn't call me to talk about that.
- Joe.

50:53.592 --> 50:55.610
No, something else.

51:00.849 --> 51:04.143
You've been engaged to Karen
Wright for a long time, haven't you?

51:04.144 --> 51:05.445
Two years.

51:06.605 --> 51:09.829
She doesn't seem to be
able to make up her mind.

51:10.025 --> 51:12.485
It wasn't that so much
as it was the school.

51:12.486 --> 51:16.614
- It was a tough job getting it on its feet.
- And there's Miss Dobie.

51:16.615 --> 51:20.076
Yes. Anyway, it's all settled.
You can buy the wedding present.

51:20.077 --> 51:21.879
It's official.

51:24.623 --> 51:27.301
Well? No congratulations?

51:31.088 --> 51:32.640
Joseph...

51:33.424 --> 51:35.317
You must not marry Karen.

51:35.759 --> 51:37.481
Why must I...

51:37.511 --> 51:39.804
What are you talking about?

51:39.805 --> 51:42.153
Why must I not marry Karen?

51:43.350 --> 51:46.324
Because there's something
very wrong with Karen.

51:47.229 --> 51:50.189
And there's something
very wrong with you

51:50.190 --> 51:52.333
for thinking you can
talk to me this way.

51:52.359 --> 51:54.878
I know what I'm talking about.

51:56.655 --> 51:58.332
Who's that?

52:00.826 --> 52:03.328
- Mrs. Tilford, is she in?
- I won't have them here.

52:03.329 --> 52:06.664
- What are you talking about?
- I won't have them here!

52:06.665 --> 52:09.388
Then you don't want me here either!

52:12.921 --> 52:15.006
Darling, what is this?

52:15.007 --> 52:17.634
- What did she do it for?
- What are you doing to us?

52:17.635 --> 52:20.595
- I don't think you should have come here.
- What is all this?

52:20.596 --> 52:23.264
- Hasn't she told you?
- Nobody has told me anything.

52:23.265 --> 52:27.310
What's the matter, Karen? Martha?
Did anything happen at the school?

52:27.311 --> 52:28.936
There is no school anymore.

52:28.937 --> 52:31.105
The children have been
taken by their parents.

52:31.106 --> 52:32.231
Why?

52:32.232 --> 52:33.983
We couldn't find out.
Nobody would tell us.

52:33.984 --> 52:35.401
Finally Mr. Burton told us.

52:35.402 --> 52:38.171
- Told you what?
- That...

52:39.740 --> 52:42.259
That Martha and I...

52:47.581 --> 52:50.350
That Martha and I have been lovers.

52:53.253 --> 52:55.396
Mrs. Tilford told them.

53:01.970 --> 53:05.399
- Did you tell them that?
- Yes.

53:05.557 --> 53:08.267
- Are you sick?
- You know I'm not sick.

53:08.268 --> 53:10.787
Then what did you do it for?

53:11.313 --> 53:13.206
Because it's true.

53:20.364 --> 53:22.782
You think it's true, then?

53:22.783 --> 53:27.537
- You crazy, crazy old woman!
- You mean, you did say it?

53:27.538 --> 53:31.666
- You knew what you were saying?
- I don't think you should have come here.

53:31.667 --> 53:35.597
I shall not call you names, and I
won't allow you to call me names.

53:35.713 --> 53:39.257
And I don't want to talk about
it with you, now or ever.

53:39.258 --> 53:41.718
What is she talking about?
What does she mean?

53:41.719 --> 53:44.147
Where did you get this idea?

53:44.805 --> 53:47.449
This can't do any of us any good.

53:49.143 --> 53:51.616
Can't do any of us any good?

53:52.646 --> 53:56.482
Listen, this is our lives
you're playing with.

53:56.483 --> 53:58.126
Our lives!

53:58.152 --> 54:01.279
That's very serious business for us.
Can you understand that?

54:01.280 --> 54:05.116
Yes, I can understand that. And I
can understand a great deal more.

54:05.117 --> 54:07.994
You've been playing with a
lot of children's lives.

54:07.995 --> 54:10.468
That's why I had to stop you.

54:10.581 --> 54:13.976
I know how serious this is for you,

54:14.001 --> 54:16.169
how serious it is for all of us.

54:16.170 --> 54:17.587
I don't think you do know.

54:17.588 --> 54:19.672
You came to find out if
I'd made the charge.

54:19.673 --> 54:23.147
You found out. I made it.
Let's end it there.

54:23.302 --> 54:25.855
I don't want you in this house.

54:26.346 --> 54:29.140
I'm deeply sorry this had
to be done to you, Joseph.

54:29.141 --> 54:33.644
- Amelia, you've done a terrible thing.
- I've done what I had to do.

54:33.645 --> 54:36.355
You know I wouldn't have
acted until I was sure.

54:36.356 --> 54:39.150
What they are is possibly
their own business.

54:39.151 --> 54:43.196
But it becomes a great deal more than
that when children are concerned.

54:43.197 --> 54:44.989
But it's not true!

54:44.990 --> 54:48.669
It's just not true, not
one single word of it!

54:49.453 --> 54:52.997
We're standing here defending
ourselves against what?

54:52.998 --> 54:57.543
Against nothing. Against a
lie, a great, awful lie.

54:57.544 --> 55:00.188
I'm sorry. I can't believe that.

55:07.721 --> 55:11.275
Don't get the idea we'll
let you whisper this lie.

55:12.226 --> 55:15.228
You made it, and you'll
come out with it.

55:15.229 --> 55:17.531
We'll make you shriek it.

55:18.941 --> 55:21.164
And you'll do it in a courtroom.

55:24.154 --> 55:27.833
Tomorrow, Mrs. Tilford, you'll
have a libel suit on your hands.

55:28.742 --> 55:31.044
Don't do that, Miss Dobie.

55:32.079 --> 55:34.552
- It frightens you, doesn't it?
- Yes.

55:34.748 --> 55:35.998
I'm frightened for you,

55:35.999 --> 55:38.677
because I know it will bring
you nothing but pain.

55:39.211 --> 55:41.963
It was wrong of you to
brazen it out here tonight.

55:41.964 --> 55:45.842
It would be criminally foolish for
you to brazen it out in public.

55:45.843 --> 55:48.469
It's already quite
public, Mrs. Tilford.

55:48.470 --> 55:51.556
Five hours ago, we had our
lives decently to ourselves.

55:51.557 --> 55:55.101
Now we have nothing left but
the dirt you made of us.

55:55.102 --> 55:58.121
The dirt you made for yourselves!

55:59.064 --> 56:01.958
This thing is your own.

56:02.734 --> 56:05.611
Go away with it.
I don't understand it.

56:05.612 --> 56:09.712
I don't want any part of it.
Take it out of here.

56:10.117 --> 56:14.342
Clean your house, Joseph, and
in time, count yourself lucky.

56:15.289 --> 56:17.762
You have understood nothing.

56:19.626 --> 56:21.769
These are my friends.

56:22.379 --> 56:25.432
When we clean house, the three
of us will clean it together.

56:31.096 --> 56:34.682
Maybe we should clean your
house for you, Mrs. Tilford.

56:34.683 --> 56:36.485
Where's Mary?

56:37.269 --> 56:39.812
Under no circumstances.
I wouldn't allow that.

56:39.813 --> 56:42.366
That's where you really got it.

56:42.524 --> 56:46.319
How could you believe a child
saying something as awful as that?

56:46.320 --> 56:49.614
And how could a child that age
even know about such things?

56:49.615 --> 56:51.574
She could hardly invent them.

56:51.575 --> 56:53.951
She's a bad girl, your Mary.
She always has been.

56:53.952 --> 56:56.037
I'll have no more of this.

56:56.038 --> 56:58.331
All I wanted to do was
get those children away.

56:58.332 --> 57:00.305
That's been done.

57:00.500 --> 57:03.303
You've been in my
house long enough.

57:04.004 --> 57:05.521
Get out!

57:16.475 --> 57:18.743
The wicked very young.

57:19.186 --> 57:21.284
The wicked very old.

57:22.522 --> 57:24.324
Let's go home.

57:32.366 --> 57:34.116
When three people come to you

57:34.117 --> 57:37.620
with their lives spread out on a
table for you to cut to pieces

57:37.621 --> 57:39.163
the only honest thing you can do

57:39.164 --> 57:42.513
is give them one last
chance to come out alive.

57:43.418 --> 57:48.064
We want that last chance. If you're
honest, you'll give it to us.

58:12.572 --> 58:13.998
Mary!

58:24.126 --> 58:25.973
Sit down, dear.

58:37.222 --> 58:39.399
I'd like to tell you something.

58:39.516 --> 58:41.267
Everybody lies all the time.

58:41.268 --> 58:43.477
Sometimes they have to,
sometimes they don't.

58:43.478 --> 58:46.605
I've told lies for a lot of
different reasons myself, but...

58:46.606 --> 58:49.608
There was rarely a time when,
if I'd had a second chance

58:49.609 --> 58:53.334
I wouldn't have taken back
the lie and told the truth.

58:53.947 --> 58:56.949
I'm telling you this because I'm
about to ask you a question.

58:56.950 --> 58:59.503
Before you answer the question

58:59.619 --> 59:04.265
I want to tell you that
if you've made a mistake

59:04.458 --> 59:06.806
you must take this
chance and say so.

59:07.335 --> 59:09.353
You won't be punished.

59:09.588 --> 59:12.767
- Do you understand all that?
- Yes, cousin Joe.

59:15.177 --> 59:19.573
Were you telling your grandmother
the truth, the exact truth

59:19.598 --> 59:22.183
about Miss Wright and Miss Dobie?

59:22.184 --> 59:24.282
Yes, cousin Joe.

59:30.233 --> 59:32.193
We're not through, Amelia.

59:32.194 --> 59:34.653
Why don't you like Miss
Wright and Miss Dobie, Mary?

59:34.654 --> 59:37.656
I do like them. They
just don't like me.

59:37.657 --> 59:39.784
They're always punishing
me for everything.

59:39.785 --> 59:43.662
- Why do you think they do that?
- Because they're...

59:43.663 --> 59:45.956
Tell your grandmother
why you were punished.

59:45.957 --> 59:49.168
Because Peggy and Evelyn heard
things and they took it out on me.

59:49.169 --> 59:52.171
- That's not true!
- Heard what, Mary?

59:52.172 --> 59:56.675
Mrs. Mortar told Miss Dobie there
was something funny about her.

59:56.676 --> 59:59.845
She said she had a funny
feeling about Miss Wright.

59:59.846 --> 01:00:04.225
Mrs. Mortar said that was unnatural.
That's why we got punished, just because...

01:00:04.226 --> 01:00:06.494
That is not the reason
they were punished.

01:00:06.686 --> 01:00:07.978
My aunt is a stupid woman.

01:00:07.979 --> 01:00:11.899
What she said was unpleasant,
but it was only said to annoy me.

01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:13.442
It meant nothing more than that!

01:00:13.443 --> 01:00:15.694
What do you think Mrs.
Mortar meant by all that?

01:00:15.695 --> 01:00:16.779
Stop it.

01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:19.365
I don't know, but all the
girls would talk about it.

01:00:19.366 --> 01:00:22.701
When Miss Wright visited Miss
Dobie's room late at night.

01:00:22.702 --> 01:00:24.870
And funny things did happen.

01:00:24.871 --> 01:00:28.415
We'd stay awake and listen, and
we'd hear strange, funny noises.

01:00:28.416 --> 01:00:30.376
- I'd get frightened.
- Be still!

01:00:30.377 --> 01:00:34.255
No, you don't want her still now. What
else did you hear? What did you see?

01:00:34.256 --> 01:00:36.024
I don't know.

01:00:36.258 --> 01:00:39.937
- They were just things.
- What things?

01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:43.364
- I don't know.
- She doesn't know?

01:00:43.473 --> 01:00:46.526
- I saw plenty of things.
- What?

01:00:46.726 --> 01:00:49.103
One night they were in
Miss Dobie's room late.

01:00:49.104 --> 01:00:53.250
And I looked through the keyhole,
and they were kissing and...

01:00:53.567 --> 01:00:55.568
Like what I told you.

01:00:55.569 --> 01:00:57.462
That child is...

01:00:57.737 --> 01:01:00.406
Ask her how she could see us again.

01:01:00.407 --> 01:01:03.325
I was leaning down by the keyhole.

01:01:03.326 --> 01:01:05.845
There's no keyhole on my door.

01:01:06.037 --> 01:01:07.429
What?

01:01:07.914 --> 01:01:10.916
There is no keyhole on my door!

01:01:10.917 --> 01:01:14.461
It wasn't her room, Grandma.
It was Miss Wright's room!

01:01:14.462 --> 01:01:16.505
How did you know anybody
was in her room?

01:01:16.506 --> 01:01:20.759
I told you. We heard them.
Everybody heard them!

01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:25.097
My room is at the other end of the house.
It's impossible to hear anything from there.

01:01:25.098 --> 01:01:26.223
What is this?

01:01:26.224 --> 01:01:28.642
Why did you say you saw
through the keyhole?

01:01:28.643 --> 01:01:31.687
I'm so mixed up! Everybody's
yelling at me at one time!

01:01:31.688 --> 01:01:34.648
I did see them! I did see them!

01:01:34.649 --> 01:01:37.748
Mary, I want the truth.

01:01:37.777 --> 01:01:40.079
Whatever it is, Mary.

01:01:41.448 --> 01:01:44.867
We're finished here. We've
cleaned your house.

01:01:44.868 --> 01:01:47.161
- Let's go home.
- Wait.

01:01:47.162 --> 01:01:51.558
Please, wait. Stop crying.
I want the truth.

01:01:55.795 --> 01:01:57.472
All right.

01:01:58.173 --> 01:02:00.350
It was Rosalie who saw them.

01:02:01.176 --> 01:02:03.444
She told us all about it.

01:02:03.678 --> 01:02:07.824
I only said it was me so I wouldn't
have to tattle on Rosalie.

01:02:08.225 --> 01:02:10.118
You ask Rosalie.

01:02:10.727 --> 01:02:13.655
She said it was when
the door was open.

01:02:13.939 --> 01:02:16.241
And she told us all about it.

01:02:22.364 --> 01:02:23.881
Agatha!

01:02:33.416 --> 01:02:34.833
Get Rosalie.

01:02:34.834 --> 01:02:36.511
Yes, ma'am.

01:02:39.089 --> 01:02:42.233
You deserve whatever
you get, Mrs. Tilford.

01:02:42.634 --> 01:02:44.686
I don't know anymore.

01:02:45.512 --> 01:02:48.440
Maybe it's what I do deserve.

01:03:30.223 --> 01:03:31.820
Rosalie...

01:03:32.726 --> 01:03:35.602
Mary says there's been a lot
of talk at school lately

01:03:35.603 --> 01:03:38.247
about Miss Wright and Miss Dobie.

01:03:38.773 --> 01:03:40.541
Is that true?

01:03:40.942 --> 01:03:42.289
'Can

01:03:44.738 --> 01:03:47.132
I don't know what you mean.

01:03:47.490 --> 01:03:50.634
That things have been
said among you girls.

01:03:52.329 --> 01:03:54.051
What things?

01:03:54.289 --> 01:03:56.933
What was the talk about?

01:03:59.002 --> 01:04:00.919
Don't be frightened.

01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:03.723
I don't know what she
means, Miss Wright.

01:04:03.923 --> 01:04:07.134
Mary has told her grandmother
that certain things at school

01:04:07.135 --> 01:04:10.689
have been puzzling you
girls, you in particular.

01:04:13.183 --> 01:04:15.360
Arithmetic puzzles me.

01:04:15.894 --> 01:04:20.040
- I guess I'm just not very good at...
- No. That's not what she meant.

01:04:20.357 --> 01:04:23.911
Mary said that you told her

01:04:24.277 --> 01:04:26.420
that you saw certain...

01:04:26.446 --> 01:04:30.546
certain things happen between Miss
Dobie and myself late at night.

01:04:30.950 --> 01:04:34.971
Once when the door was open,
you saw us together in my room.

01:04:35.205 --> 01:04:38.634
Oh, Miss Wright,
I didn't. I didn't.

01:04:38.666 --> 01:04:41.515
- I never said any such thing.
- Mary!

01:04:41.961 --> 01:04:44.138
Yes, you did, too.

01:04:44.172 --> 01:04:46.816
You told us about what you saw.

01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:48.926
I remember...

01:04:48.927 --> 01:04:51.220
It was the day that Helen
Burton's bracelet...

01:04:51.221 --> 01:04:52.471
I never did!

01:04:52.472 --> 01:04:55.474
The day Helen Burton's
bracelet was stolen.

01:04:55.475 --> 01:04:57.851
And no one knew who did it.

01:04:57.852 --> 01:04:59.436
Don't you remember?

01:04:59.437 --> 01:05:02.898
Helen said that if her
mother found out who did it

01:05:02.899 --> 01:05:06.954
she would call the police,
and have the thief put in jail.

01:05:07.654 --> 01:05:10.656
Rosalie, there's no need to cry.

01:05:10.657 --> 01:05:13.085
You must help us by
telling the truth.

01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:20.592
Grandma.

01:05:21.751 --> 01:05:23.553
Yes! Yes! Yes!

01:05:24.379 --> 01:05:27.840
I told Mary! What
Mary said was true!

01:05:27.841 --> 01:05:30.360
I said it! I said it! I said it!

01:06:58.598 --> 01:07:00.571
It's cold in here.

01:07:01.684 --> 01:07:03.076
Yes.

01:07:08.399 --> 01:07:10.292
What time is it?

01:07:10.777 --> 01:07:12.545
I don't know.

01:07:15.782 --> 01:07:18.631
I was hoping it was
time for my bath.

01:07:24.457 --> 01:07:26.509
Take it early today.

01:07:28.169 --> 01:07:30.392
I couldn't do that.

01:07:31.130 --> 01:07:33.933
I look forward all
day to that bath.

01:07:35.176 --> 01:07:39.356
Makes me feel important to know
there's one thing I have to do.

01:07:39.931 --> 01:07:42.233
Kind of a date with something.

01:08:09.335 --> 01:08:10.636
Let's go out.

01:08:14.632 --> 01:08:16.309
Take a walk.

01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:20.028
What if we see somebody?

01:08:21.723 --> 01:08:23.524
What if we do?

01:08:25.143 --> 01:08:26.660
Come on.

01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:29.098
We'll go tomorrow.

01:09:29.122 --> 01:09:30.890
No, we won't.

01:09:56.484 --> 01:09:58.536
There's our friend.

01:10:01.781 --> 01:10:04.449
I knocked on the kitchen
door, but nobody answered.

01:10:04.450 --> 01:10:06.923
You said that last week.

01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:09.639
All right. Thank you. Good-bye.

01:10:17.046 --> 01:10:18.598
Stop it!

01:10:20.883 --> 01:10:22.926
I've got eight fingers, see?

01:10:22.927 --> 01:10:25.605
And two heads! I'm a freak!

01:10:47.243 --> 01:10:49.637
Martha, what are we
doing here like this?

01:10:50.413 --> 01:10:54.809
It's as if we're in a nightmare
and can't seem to wake up.

01:10:58.921 --> 01:11:04.148
You'll be getting married soon.
Everything will be all right then.

01:11:04.802 --> 01:11:06.900
It'll be a good day

01:11:07.472 --> 01:11:09.900
and a happy one for me, too.

01:11:14.687 --> 01:11:16.785
What's wrong?

01:11:17.857 --> 01:11:20.034
There's nothing wrong.

01:11:20.860 --> 01:11:24.004
It's just that I don't know
what I'm thinking anymore.

01:12:02.819 --> 01:12:05.963
That about sums up my
official duty, Dr. Cardin.

01:12:06.489 --> 01:12:09.616
I don't have to tell you how much
we've valued having you here.

01:12:09.617 --> 01:12:11.743
You also know this
hospital is kept going

01:12:11.744 --> 01:12:14.412
by people who are meddlesome
as well as generous.

01:12:14.413 --> 01:12:17.249
- Thanks for the speech.
- Joe!

01:12:17.250 --> 01:12:20.126
Everybody here knows that
you're not guilty of anything.

01:12:20.127 --> 01:12:22.379
It's a matter of association.

01:12:22.380 --> 01:12:26.007
I feel sure that if you were
to sever your relationship

01:12:26.008 --> 01:12:28.777
with these two young women...

01:12:30.596 --> 01:12:32.239
I'm sorry.

01:12:33.474 --> 01:12:35.071
Good-bye.

01:12:55.204 --> 01:12:57.256
I don't believe it.

01:13:07.091 --> 01:13:08.984
And here I am!

01:13:11.053 --> 01:13:14.277
Hello! Hello! Hello!

01:13:17.226 --> 01:13:19.278
May I come in?

01:13:20.563 --> 01:13:22.536
My old chair.

01:13:25.026 --> 01:13:27.545
It's very good to see you both.

01:13:28.029 --> 01:13:30.752
How is everything?

01:13:32.700 --> 01:13:34.673
Everything's fine.

01:13:34.702 --> 01:13:36.299
How are you?

01:13:36.871 --> 01:13:38.548
A little tired.

01:13:38.706 --> 01:13:41.917
- It's been a long trip.
- Of course.

01:13:41.918 --> 01:13:43.960
Is there anything I can get you?

01:13:43.961 --> 01:13:47.047
You know, I would like a cup
of tea, but don't you bother.

01:13:47.048 --> 01:13:50.227
It's no bother, no bother at all.

01:13:50.343 --> 01:13:52.441
Why, Martha...

01:13:53.179 --> 01:13:54.512
You know, I think...

01:13:54.513 --> 01:13:56.611
Where have you been?

01:13:56.682 --> 01:14:01.019
- Now, there's your temper again.
- Answer me!

01:14:01.020 --> 01:14:04.773
I've been on tour, you knew that.
Mostly one-night stands,

01:14:04.774 --> 01:14:08.193
although we did have one
ghastly week in Detroit.

01:14:08.194 --> 01:14:10.862
But the theater's changed.
There's no question of it.

01:14:10.863 --> 01:14:14.032
They simply will not accept
a serious play on the road.

01:14:14.033 --> 01:14:15.951
Isn't that interesting?

01:14:15.952 --> 01:14:18.453
Is it a trend? Will it pass?

01:14:18.454 --> 01:14:21.498
I don't know. I really
just don't know.

01:14:21.499 --> 01:14:24.751
I was interviewed in San Francisco

01:14:24.752 --> 01:14:27.879
and, I said, quite frankly...

01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:30.715
I said that perhaps a whole
culture is changing.

01:14:30.716 --> 01:14:32.050
It's possible, you know.

01:14:32.051 --> 01:14:34.719
You think so? A whole culture.

01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:37.864
My, we'd be so interested
to hear about it.

01:14:39.183 --> 01:14:43.353
- Why didn't you answer our telegrams?
- I told you, I was moving around.

01:14:43.354 --> 01:14:45.563
How did you manage to
get out of the summons?

01:14:45.564 --> 01:14:48.066
What difference does it
all make now, anyway?

01:14:48.067 --> 01:14:51.778
Karen is quite right. Let's
let bygones be bygones.

01:14:51.779 --> 01:14:55.532
Why did you refuse to come
back here and testify for us?

01:14:55.533 --> 01:14:58.576
I didn't refuse. I was on tour.
That's a moral obligation.

01:14:58.577 --> 01:15:01.881
I couldn't just leave.
The curtain must go up.

01:15:02.331 --> 01:15:05.583
For goodness sakes,
let's not go on like this.

01:15:05.584 --> 01:15:10.338
- My trunk's at the station.
- Things have changed here, Mrs. Mortar.

01:15:10.339 --> 01:15:12.507
I don't suppose you've
heard about it...

01:15:12.508 --> 01:15:15.760
Although it's been in every
newspaper in the country.

01:15:15.761 --> 01:15:20.265
How we lost a suit for slander
against a woman named Tilford

01:15:20.266 --> 01:15:24.102
who accused us of having
had what the judge called,

01:15:24.103 --> 01:15:27.247
"Sinful sexual knowledge
of one another",

01:15:27.273 --> 01:15:31.735
based on remarks made by one
Lily Mortar against her niece.

01:15:31.736 --> 01:15:32.819
But, my dear...

01:15:32.820 --> 01:15:36.197
A large part of the defense's
case rested on the telling fact

01:15:36.198 --> 01:15:38.783
that Mrs. Mortar would
not appear in court

01:15:38.784 --> 01:15:42.463
to confirm, explain,
or deny those remarks.

01:15:42.955 --> 01:15:46.259
She had a moral obligation
to the theater.

01:15:46.417 --> 01:15:48.668
It wouldn't have done any good

01:15:48.669 --> 01:15:52.519
for us all to get mixed up in
this unpleasant notoriety.

01:15:52.548 --> 01:15:54.896
But I do see it your way.

01:15:55.009 --> 01:15:56.843
And now that I'm here,

01:15:56.844 --> 01:15:58.845
I'm going to stand shoulder
to shoulder with you.

01:15:58.846 --> 01:16:01.740
There's an 8:00 train. Get on it.

01:16:04.935 --> 01:16:08.480
All my grown life, I've been
something for you to pick dry.

01:16:08.481 --> 01:16:10.783
Now get out and don't come back.

01:16:11.859 --> 01:16:14.486
How can you talk to me like that?

01:16:14.487 --> 01:16:18.166
Because I hate you.
I've always hated you.

01:16:22.369 --> 01:16:24.797
God will punish you for that.

01:16:25.498 --> 01:16:27.596
He's doing all right.

01:16:29.168 --> 01:16:33.473
I'll wait upstairs
until train time.

01:16:36.550 --> 01:16:40.571
You'll be sorry one day for
what you've said to me.

01:16:42.181 --> 01:16:45.725
Look who's here. A few
weeks late, aren't you?

01:16:45.726 --> 01:16:48.686
So it's you. I call that loyal.

01:16:48.687 --> 01:16:51.490
A lot of men wouldn't
still be here.

01:16:51.857 --> 01:16:56.333
- You're a very lucky girl, Karen.
- Get out of here!

01:17:06.372 --> 01:17:08.549
Why did she come back?

01:17:09.333 --> 01:17:11.010
She's broke.

01:17:13.003 --> 01:17:14.796
Stop it.

01:17:14.797 --> 01:17:17.099
She's not worth all that.

01:17:17.216 --> 01:17:20.065
We'll give her some money
and get rid of her.

01:17:26.475 --> 01:17:29.352
- Why'd you do that?
- Do what?

01:17:29.353 --> 01:17:31.326
Turn away from me.

01:17:32.273 --> 01:17:36.203
I didn't turn away from you.
I was putting out a cigarette.

01:17:37.736 --> 01:17:39.037
Karen.

01:17:42.867 --> 01:17:45.410
We sit around here much
longer, we'll all go mad.

01:17:45.411 --> 01:17:47.839
So we're not going to sit around.

01:17:48.330 --> 01:17:52.375
- I sold my place this morning to Foster.
- You can't do that!

01:17:52.376 --> 01:17:53.835
We're getting married this week.

01:17:53.836 --> 01:17:56.087
You have two days to pack
and close the place.

01:17:56.088 --> 01:17:58.923
- Thursday we'll be in the car...
- You can't leave here. I won't let you...

01:17:58.924 --> 01:18:01.467
It's all done. I found a good
place that needs a doctor.

01:18:01.468 --> 01:18:03.928
It's farm country. It'll
be tough at first.

01:18:03.929 --> 01:18:07.724
But we'll live cheaply. There will
be plenty for all three of us.

01:18:07.725 --> 01:18:10.768
Joe, I'm not going with you.

01:18:10.769 --> 01:18:12.353
But thank you, from the
bottom of my heart.

01:18:12.354 --> 01:18:15.123
You're coming with us.
We want you to come.

01:18:15.274 --> 01:18:18.919
It's going to be good,
starting fresh in a new place.

01:18:18.944 --> 01:18:20.791
You don't want to go.

01:18:22.948 --> 01:18:25.617
No. I don't want to go.

01:18:25.618 --> 01:18:28.203
This was my place,
where I wanted to be.

01:18:28.204 --> 01:18:30.914
And you don't want to go. You
wanted to stay here, too.

01:18:30.915 --> 01:18:34.792
We can't stay, so to hell with it. We're
going to a place where we can live.

01:18:34.793 --> 01:18:36.515
Joe's right.

01:18:37.254 --> 01:18:40.590
But I'm not going with you. It's
better for all of us if I don't go.

01:18:40.591 --> 01:18:42.967
Stop talking nonsense.
You're coming with us.

01:18:42.968 --> 01:18:47.148
Later on, you can leave if you want to,
when you have something to leave for.

01:18:47.932 --> 01:18:49.575
All right?

01:18:51.477 --> 01:18:53.120
All right.

01:18:54.230 --> 01:18:56.439
I think I'll cook us a dinner.

01:18:56.440 --> 01:19:00.665
A departure dinner, whatever
that is. Something fancy.

01:19:03.697 --> 01:19:05.624
I've done this to you.

01:19:05.824 --> 01:19:08.627
I've taken away
everything you wanted.

01:19:08.953 --> 01:19:11.631
Stop talking that way.

01:19:13.707 --> 01:19:17.210
There are a lot of people in
this world who have bad trouble.

01:19:17.211 --> 01:19:20.139
We happen to be three
of those people.

01:19:20.256 --> 01:19:23.841
We could sit around the rest of our
lives and live on that trouble

01:19:23.842 --> 01:19:26.094
and we'd get to where
we'd have nothing else,

01:19:26.095 --> 01:19:28.318
because we wanted nothing else.

01:19:28.764 --> 01:19:31.557
We're going to put the
whole business behind us.

01:19:31.558 --> 01:19:35.829
There'll be no more talk about what
could have been or should have been.

01:19:36.397 --> 01:19:37.480
I'm sorry.

01:19:37.481 --> 01:19:40.625
I'll be all right as soon
as we get out of here.

01:19:41.110 --> 01:19:43.333
Joe, I want a baby.

01:19:43.404 --> 01:19:45.446
I want to have a baby.

01:19:45.447 --> 01:19:49.217
Maybe in a year or so. We
won't have enough money now.

01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:53.705
But I don't want to wait a year. You
said you wanted children right away.

01:19:53.706 --> 01:19:55.349
Why have you changed?

01:19:55.874 --> 01:19:57.208
We can't go on like this!

01:19:57.209 --> 01:19:59.978
Everything I say is made
to mean something else.

01:20:02.214 --> 01:20:04.482
Yes, every word has a new meaning.

01:20:04.967 --> 01:20:07.135
Child, love...

01:20:07.136 --> 01:20:08.904
Friend, woman.

01:20:09.847 --> 01:20:12.696
There aren't many
safe words anymore.

01:20:13.392 --> 01:20:16.571
Even marriage doesn't have
the same meaning anymore.

01:20:19.356 --> 01:20:21.658
It does to me, and it
should to you, if...

01:20:24.945 --> 01:20:26.029
If what?

01:20:26.030 --> 01:20:29.425
If you won't try to
take the past with us.

01:20:30.951 --> 01:20:33.786
Wherever we go, that'll
be with us a long time.

01:20:33.787 --> 01:20:35.955
We can't move away from that.

01:20:35.956 --> 01:20:39.305
A new place, a new room
won't fix that for us.

01:20:41.253 --> 01:20:43.271
It won't work.

01:20:43.756 --> 01:20:45.631
What won't work?

01:20:45.632 --> 01:20:47.842
The two of us, together.

01:20:47.843 --> 01:20:51.397
Stop talking like that. You'll
begin to believe it soon.

01:20:51.555 --> 01:20:55.058
Tell me. Tell me what
you want to know.

01:20:55.059 --> 01:20:57.852
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Yes, you do.

01:20:57.853 --> 01:21:01.999
We've both known for a long time.
Say it now. Ask it now!

01:21:02.066 --> 01:21:04.915
I have nothing to ask.

01:21:07.446 --> 01:21:10.295
All right, is it? Was it ever?

01:21:14.536 --> 01:21:15.928
No.

01:21:17.664 --> 01:21:20.763
No, Martha and I never
touched each other.

01:21:22.336 --> 01:21:25.139
It's all right, darling.
I'm glad you asked.

01:21:25.255 --> 01:21:28.399
My God! What's happened to me?

01:21:29.009 --> 01:21:32.303
I'm sorry, darling. I didn't mean
to ask that. I never believed...

01:21:32.304 --> 01:21:33.971
I know.

01:21:33.972 --> 01:21:37.183
Of course you didn't, but after
a while, you weren't sure

01:21:37.184 --> 01:21:39.486
and then you began to wonder.

01:21:40.062 --> 01:21:44.367
You've been a good, loyal friend.
Don't be ashamed of what you felt.

01:21:46.735 --> 01:21:50.113
All right, good or bad, I've
asked, you've answered.

01:21:50.114 --> 01:21:51.697
That's all.

01:21:51.698 --> 01:21:53.750
Let's go ahead now.

01:21:58.080 --> 01:21:59.927
You believe me?

01:22:00.249 --> 01:22:02.301
Of course I believe you.

01:22:05.421 --> 01:22:06.813
Yes.

01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:09.642
Maybe you do.

01:22:10.843 --> 01:22:13.145
But I'd never know whether you did.

01:22:13.637 --> 01:22:16.360
And your saying it
again won't do it.

01:22:17.683 --> 01:22:19.851
It doesn't matter anymore
whether you believe me.

01:22:19.852 --> 01:22:23.372
All I know is, I'd be
frightened that you didn't.

01:22:23.439 --> 01:22:27.084
That's the way it would be.
We'd be haunted by it.

01:22:27.192 --> 01:22:29.944
Things would never, ever be
right between us like that.

01:22:29.945 --> 01:22:31.292
You know that.

01:22:31.905 --> 01:22:37.034
- Darling, I didn't know what I was asking.
- Don't be sorry. You can't help it.

01:22:37.035 --> 01:22:40.965
It would have been a miracle if the
poison hadn't reached you, too.

01:22:42.374 --> 01:22:44.676
But go away for a while.

01:22:46.295 --> 01:22:48.921
Go away from me and love and pity,

01:22:48.922 --> 01:22:51.850
and all the things
that mess people up.

01:22:53.343 --> 01:22:57.022
Go away by yourself
and I will, too.

01:22:58.974 --> 01:23:01.276
And after a while, I'll know.

01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:06.323
And you'll know, and
then we'll see.

01:23:06.482 --> 01:23:09.817
- Please.
- There's nothing for me to know.

01:23:09.818 --> 01:23:13.070
- A few weeks won't make any difference.
- Please!

01:23:13.071 --> 01:23:15.044
I don't want to go!

01:23:17.201 --> 01:23:19.094
Go now, darling.

01:23:24.875 --> 01:23:26.802
What will you do?

01:23:27.419 --> 01:23:29.392
I'll be all right.

01:23:30.797 --> 01:23:32.724
Go now, darling.

01:23:35.636 --> 01:23:37.813
If it's what you want.

01:23:38.764 --> 01:23:40.236
It is.

01:23:43.101 --> 01:23:45.199
I'll be coming back.

01:23:45.687 --> 01:23:47.910
I'll be coming back soon.

01:23:56.323 --> 01:23:58.421
I don't think so.

01:24:05.958 --> 01:24:07.931
Oh, God!

01:24:10.587 --> 01:24:12.480
Hold still!

01:24:17.970 --> 01:24:20.680
You're as nervous as a cat.
What's the matter with you?

01:24:20.681 --> 01:24:25.476
- I couldn't sleep well last night.
- Going to a new school, I understand.

01:24:25.477 --> 01:24:28.771
You'll like Elmhurst. Doris
Tanner thinks it's wonderful.

01:24:28.772 --> 01:24:31.148
Doris Tanner just likes horses.

01:24:31.149 --> 01:24:34.068
That's all they do
at Elmhurst, ride.

01:24:34.069 --> 01:24:36.654
It has a very high rating,
and you'll make new friends.

01:24:36.655 --> 01:24:40.004
You won't be moping around,
like you did all summer.

01:24:44.830 --> 01:24:46.973
What's all this?

01:24:51.753 --> 01:24:55.432
My compact! I've been
looking everywhere...

01:24:58.635 --> 01:25:00.687
And whose ring is this?

01:25:02.347 --> 01:25:05.400
This scarf and gloves?

01:25:15.986 --> 01:25:18.505
"Happy birthday, Helen."

01:25:40.093 --> 01:25:41.690
Mary!

01:25:46.933 --> 01:25:49.560
She made me do it!
She made me do it!

01:25:49.561 --> 01:25:52.355
Don't believe her! She's just
trying to blame it on me...

01:25:52.356 --> 01:25:53.873
Be still!

01:25:59.404 --> 01:26:01.206
Come here.

01:26:16.755 --> 01:26:18.227
No.

01:26:18.256 --> 01:26:19.728
No!

01:26:20.258 --> 01:26:22.060
I'm all right.

01:27:06.138 --> 01:27:08.987
Cooking always makes
me feel better.

01:27:12.018 --> 01:27:16.289
I suppose we'll have to feed the
duchess. Even vultures have to eat.

01:27:17.357 --> 01:27:19.483
I baked a cake.

01:27:19.484 --> 01:27:21.986
And you know what?
I found a bottle of wine.

01:27:21.987 --> 01:27:23.504
We'll have a good dinner.

01:27:25.782 --> 01:27:27.459
Where's Joe?

01:27:28.034 --> 01:27:29.460
Gone.

01:27:30.162 --> 01:27:33.716
A patient? Will he be
back in time for dinner?

01:27:34.374 --> 01:27:35.721
No.

01:27:37.794 --> 01:27:40.313
Then we'll wait dinner for him.

01:27:44.509 --> 01:27:46.311
What's the matter?

01:27:49.890 --> 01:27:52.192
He won't be back anymore.

01:27:57.481 --> 01:28:00.751
You mean, he won't be
back anymore tonight.

01:28:03.403 --> 01:28:05.671
He won't be back at all.

01:28:07.908 --> 01:28:09.710
What happened?

01:28:10.660 --> 01:28:12.712
Karen, what happened?

01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:16.808
He thought...

01:28:18.376 --> 01:28:20.053
it was true.

01:28:28.053 --> 01:28:30.105
I don't believe it.

01:28:30.889 --> 01:28:32.848
I don't believe it!

01:28:32.849 --> 01:28:37.450
- What kind of talk is that? I don't believe it.
- All right!

01:28:38.438 --> 01:28:42.066
Didn't you tell him? For God's sake,
didn't you tell him it wasn't true?

01:28:42.067 --> 01:28:43.459
Yes!

01:28:44.569 --> 01:28:46.712
He didn't believe you?

01:28:48.949 --> 01:28:51.297
I guess he believed me.

01:28:52.077 --> 01:28:54.300
Then what have you done?

01:28:54.913 --> 01:28:56.330
I don't understand.

01:28:56.331 --> 01:28:58.374
What do you mean, you
guess he believed you?

01:28:58.375 --> 01:29:01.724
I don't want to talk
about it. It's over.

01:29:06.758 --> 01:29:09.982
Lord, I wanted that
for you so much!

01:29:14.307 --> 01:29:16.484
What's happened to us?

01:29:19.938 --> 01:29:21.911
Whatever happened

01:29:22.107 --> 01:29:23.899
go back to Joe.

01:29:23.900 --> 01:29:28.330
- It's too much for you this way.
- Stop talking about it.

01:29:29.197 --> 01:29:33.117
Let's pack and get out of here.
Let's take the train tomorrow.

01:29:33.118 --> 01:29:34.451
The train to where?

01:29:34.452 --> 01:29:37.329
I don't know. There must
be someplace we can go.

01:29:37.330 --> 01:29:39.598
I don't know where it is.

01:29:39.916 --> 01:29:43.595
They'd know about us.
We've been famous.

01:29:46.298 --> 01:29:48.382
But this isn't a new sin
they say we've done.

01:29:48.383 --> 01:29:51.061
Other people haven't
been destroyed by it.

01:29:55.056 --> 01:29:57.905
They're the people
who believe in it,

01:29:58.143 --> 01:29:59.820
who want it.

01:30:00.562 --> 01:30:03.206
Who've chosen it for themselves.

01:30:04.399 --> 01:30:06.451
We aren't like that.

01:30:07.152 --> 01:30:09.580
That must be very different.

01:30:10.906 --> 01:30:13.504
We don't love each other.

01:30:15.285 --> 01:30:17.494
We've been close to each other.

01:30:17.495 --> 01:30:20.844
Of course, I've loved
you like a friend,

01:30:20.957 --> 01:30:24.477
the way thousands of women
feel about other women.

01:30:25.211 --> 01:30:26.337
I'm cold.

01:30:26.338 --> 01:30:29.506
You were a dear friend who
was loved, that's all.

01:30:29.507 --> 01:30:32.217
Certainly there can be
nothing wrong with that.

01:30:32.218 --> 01:30:35.596
It's perfectly natural that
I should be fond of you.

01:30:35.597 --> 01:30:39.516
We've known each other since we were
17, and I always thought that...

01:30:39.517 --> 01:30:42.036
Why are you saying all of this?

01:30:45.023 --> 01:30:47.200
Because I do love you.

01:30:50.904 --> 01:30:53.252
Of course. I love you, too.

01:30:56.618 --> 01:30:58.135
But...

01:30:58.620 --> 01:31:02.039
maybe I love you the way
they said I love you.

01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:03.808
I don't know.

01:31:08.546 --> 01:31:10.473
Listen to me!

01:31:12.842 --> 01:31:15.611
I have loved you the way they said!

01:31:20.725 --> 01:31:23.528
There's always been
something wrong.

01:31:24.062 --> 01:31:27.036
Always, just as long
as I can remember.

01:31:27.357 --> 01:31:30.567
But I never knew what it was
until all this happened.

01:31:30.568 --> 01:31:32.461
Stop it.

01:31:33.738 --> 01:31:36.040
Stop this crazy talk!

01:31:36.074 --> 01:31:40.160
You're afraid of hearing it,
but I'm more afraid than you.

01:31:40.161 --> 01:31:43.747
- I won't listen to you.
- No! You've got to know.

01:31:43.748 --> 01:31:47.643
I've got to tell you. I can't
keep it to myself any longer.

01:31:47.752 --> 01:31:49.554
I'm guilty!

01:31:49.587 --> 01:31:52.390
You're guilty of nothing!

01:31:55.176 --> 01:31:57.604
I've been telling myself that

01:31:57.929 --> 01:32:00.982
since the night I heard
the child say it.

01:32:01.641 --> 01:32:05.936
I lie in bed night after night,
praying that it isn't true.

01:32:05.937 --> 01:32:08.160
But I know about it now.

01:32:08.231 --> 01:32:09.857
It's there.

01:32:09.858 --> 01:32:13.253
I don't know how, I don't know why.

01:32:13.737 --> 01:32:15.529
But I did love you.

01:32:15.530 --> 01:32:17.332
I do love you!

01:32:20.493 --> 01:32:23.091
I resented your plans to marry

01:32:23.413 --> 01:32:25.748
maybe because I wanted you.

01:32:25.749 --> 01:32:28.427
Maybe I've wanted you
all these years.

01:32:28.793 --> 01:32:31.879
I couldn't call it by name before,

01:32:31.880 --> 01:32:34.548
but maybe it's been there
since I first knew you.

01:32:34.549 --> 01:32:37.134
But it's not the truth.
Not a word of it is true.

01:32:37.135 --> 01:32:40.314
We've never thought of
each other that way.

01:32:40.555 --> 01:32:42.698
No, of course you didn't.

01:32:44.059 --> 01:32:45.736
But who's to say I didn't?

01:32:47.312 --> 01:32:50.866
I never felt that way
about anybody but you.

01:32:52.150 --> 01:32:54.373
I've never loved a man.

01:32:55.070 --> 01:32:57.793
I never knew why before.

01:32:58.156 --> 01:33:00.083
Maybe it's that.

01:33:00.325 --> 01:33:03.629
You're tired and worn out.

01:33:04.621 --> 01:33:06.163
It's funny.

01:33:06.164 --> 01:33:08.432
It's all mixed up.

01:33:08.708 --> 01:33:12.294
There's something in you, and you
don't know anything about it

01:33:12.295 --> 01:33:14.755
because you don't know it's there.

01:33:14.756 --> 01:33:16.774
And then suddenly

01:33:17.008 --> 01:33:20.778
one night, a little girl
gets bored and tells a lie.

01:33:20.970 --> 01:33:24.014
And there, for the
first time, you see it

01:33:24.015 --> 01:33:28.143
and you say to yourself, "Did
she see it? Did she sense it?"

01:33:28.144 --> 01:33:32.119
But it could have been any lie!
She was looking for anything to...

01:33:32.398 --> 01:33:34.496
But why this lie?

01:33:34.734 --> 01:33:37.833
She found the lie with
the ounce of truth.

01:33:38.321 --> 01:33:40.531
Don't you see?

01:33:40.532 --> 01:33:43.381
I can't stand to have you touch me!

01:33:44.035 --> 01:33:47.179
I can't stand to
have you look at me!

01:33:47.622 --> 01:33:50.095
It's all my fault!

01:33:50.625 --> 01:33:54.179
I've ruined your life,
and I've ruined my own.

01:33:54.212 --> 01:33:56.856
I swear I didn't know it!

01:33:56.881 --> 01:33:59.229
I didn't mean it!

01:34:00.343 --> 01:34:05.615
I feel so damn sick and dirty,
I can't stand it anymore!

01:34:53.938 --> 01:34:57.742
I have something to say to you.

01:35:02.363 --> 01:35:04.210
Let me come in.

01:35:04.699 --> 01:35:06.216
Please.

01:35:08.119 --> 01:35:10.342
You must hear me.

01:35:13.666 --> 01:35:18.517
Mary and Rosalie Wells have
admitted the whole thing was a lie.

01:35:24.469 --> 01:35:26.692
I have more to tell you.

01:35:38.399 --> 01:35:41.999
I tried to call Joe. He
wouldn't answer my call.

01:35:42.487 --> 01:35:45.085
But I've spoken to Judge Potter.

01:35:45.114 --> 01:35:48.759
He'll hold a hearing and
reverse the court decision.

01:35:49.327 --> 01:35:53.302
There'll be a public apology and
an explanation in the papers.

01:35:54.540 --> 01:35:58.310
The damage suit, of course,
will be paid to you in full.

01:35:58.628 --> 01:36:02.774
And anymore that you'll be
kind enough to take from me.

01:36:12.100 --> 01:36:15.495
So you've come here to
relieve your conscience.

01:36:15.895 --> 01:36:20.701
A public apology and money paid,
and you can rest your head again.

01:36:26.364 --> 01:36:30.669
Don't rest it! You've
come to the wrong place!

01:36:31.869 --> 01:36:35.298
There's nothing we want
from you, Mrs. Tilford.

01:36:36.582 --> 01:36:40.011
There's no relief that
can be bought for me.

01:36:40.878 --> 01:36:44.682
I didn't come here for that.
I swear to God, I didn't.

01:36:47.802 --> 01:36:50.730
There must be something I can do.

01:36:51.973 --> 01:36:53.490
Please?

01:36:56.144 --> 01:36:58.071
Please, help me!

01:36:58.479 --> 01:37:00.031
Help you?

01:37:29.927 --> 01:37:33.902
Please go, Mrs. Tilford.
We don't want you here!

01:38:42.792 --> 01:38:46.471
I'm going away someplace
to begin again.

01:38:53.052 --> 01:38:55.229
Will you come with me?

01:39:02.645 --> 01:39:04.743
We can find work now.

01:39:07.859 --> 01:39:09.832
Thank you.

01:39:12.697 --> 01:39:14.999
Let's talk about it tomorrow.

01:39:15.450 --> 01:39:17.627
I want to go to sleep.

01:42:39.612 --> 01:42:40.913
Martha!

01:42:44.992 --> 01:42:46.293
Martha?

01:42:46.869 --> 01:42:49.388
Karen, is Martha with you?

01:43:54.311 --> 01:43:57.285
Her door is locked.
I don't understand.

01:45:11.806 --> 01:45:14.265
"The Lord bless you and keep you

01:45:14.266 --> 01:45:16.785
"and make His face
to shine upon you

01:45:17.895 --> 01:45:19.896
"and give you peace.

01:45:19.897 --> 01:45:22.120
"Both now and evermore."

01:45:39.375 --> 01:45:41.302
Goodbye, Martha.

01:45:41.710 --> 01:45:44.354
I'll miss you with all my heart.
