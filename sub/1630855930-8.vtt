02:10.880 --> 02:12.000
So, what now?

02:13.080 --> 02:14.360
Did she make it?

02:15.560 --> 02:16.400
I don't know.

02:17.520 --> 02:20.280
But if it's worked,
then we shouldn't be here.

02:23.000 --> 02:23.880
But we are.

02:27.320 --> 02:28.600
[music continues]

02:43.960 --> 02:45.360
God, I hate it here.

02:45.440 --> 02:46.360
[music fades]

I feel like I'm walking over my own grave.

[thunder rumbling in distance]

Defoe.

03:10.680 --> 03:13.080
[mysterious music playing]

03:16.080 --> 03:17.000
She made it.

03:18.600 --> 03:19.520
[chuckles softly]

03:22.760 --> 03:23.600
[Hasan] Wait.

03:25.160 --> 03:28.320
There's Hillinghead, but look.

[ominous music playing]

[dramatic string music playing]

03:51.960 --> 03:54.680
Inspector, there's a cripple
in the cell saying your name.

03:54.760 --> 03:57.240
-Tell him to wait.
-He's a she, sir.

03:57.320 --> 03:58.160
[knock at door]

04:02.560 --> 04:05.920
Inside is everything you need
to get your man, Inspector.

04:06.840 --> 04:07.840
[Paxman] About time.

04:09.200 --> 04:10.280
Leave it there.

04:11.360 --> 04:13.720
The case is now closed.

04:18.760 --> 04:21.640
So this cripple, sir,
she's queer sounding.

04:21.720 --> 04:24.800
Keeps saying, "Get me Hillinghead."
Howling it, sir.

04:24.880 --> 04:27.360
I think her name was May, Maypolewood.
Ring any bells?

04:27.440 --> 04:30.000
Never heard of her. Deal with it yourself.

04:31.520 --> 04:32.720
Tell her I'm a wanted man.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.200
[music continues]

04:43.000 --> 04:44.160
What's the matter?

04:46.040 --> 04:47.200
Is it the journalist?

04:47.960 --> 04:49.080
[loud knocking at door]

04:49.160 --> 04:51.920
-[officer] Open up!
-[Polly] You didn't do this!

04:52.000 --> 04:54.040
[Paxman] Your husband's a murderer,
Mrs. Hillinghead.

04:54.120 --> 04:57.320
-[Polly] He--
-See his signed confession for yourself.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.640
[Hillinghead] Oh, you're the cripple.

05:42.160 --> 05:43.760
You were calling my name.

05:44.720 --> 05:46.680
[mysterious music playing]

05:47.760 --> 05:49.200
[Maplewood grunts] Finally!

05:49.280 --> 05:50.800
[shudders]

05:51.400 --> 05:54.160
You've just handed yourself in
for murder, right?

05:54.240 --> 05:56.120
The-- The Longharvest murder?

05:57.280 --> 05:59.400
How do you know that? Who are you?

05:59.480 --> 06:00.520
I, uh…

06:01.960 --> 06:03.960
[sputtering] I come from a far…

06:04.040 --> 06:04.920
Mm.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.720
No. No, um…

06:08.800 --> 06:10.560
Do you read science fiction?

06:11.520 --> 06:12.520
Science what?

06:12.600 --> 06:14.480
[footsteps approaching]

06:19.440 --> 06:21.960
This is going to sound crazy…

06:22.440 --> 06:24.080
-Uh-huh.
-[door closes]

06:25.520 --> 06:26.720
…but it's the truth.

06:27.880 --> 06:29.720
You've just got to listen to me.

06:30.560 --> 06:31.520
Okay?

06:31.600 --> 06:33.680
-Uh-huh.
-[Maplewood chuckles dryly] Okay.

06:36.440 --> 06:38.040
The murder you've confessed to…

06:39.960 --> 06:41.280
he was found naked.

06:43.880 --> 06:45.480
A bullet hole in his left eye.

06:46.320 --> 06:48.720
A weird marking on his wrist.

06:50.920 --> 06:52.480
There was no exit wound.

06:54.360 --> 06:55.440
And no bullet.

06:59.680 --> 07:01.120
How could you know that?

07:03.600 --> 07:05.320
Because I'm the one who shot him.

07:08.120 --> 07:09.560
The body you found,

07:09.640 --> 07:12.440
your suspect, Sir Julian Harker,

07:13.760 --> 07:14.720
and me,

07:16.800 --> 07:18.320
we're all from the future.

07:19.800 --> 07:20.760
[Hillinghead] Oh, right.

07:20.840 --> 07:25.120
In that future, Harker's committed murder

07:25.200 --> 07:27.440
on a scale you could never believe.

07:27.520 --> 07:29.840
-[grunting softly]
-Hundreds of thou-- What?

07:29.920 --> 07:30.960
What are you doing?

07:31.040 --> 07:33.000
[Hillinghead groans]
Just leave me in peace.

07:33.080 --> 07:34.160
[Maplewood] Peace? But--

07:34.240 --> 07:36.600
Fuck no, you-- you've got to listen.

07:36.680 --> 07:38.440
-You've got to--
-[man] You! Water.

07:38.520 --> 07:39.960
-[clanks]
-[man grunts]

07:44.560 --> 07:46.760
My daughter threw tantrums like you.

07:47.720 --> 07:49.360
Till she was 13 years old.

07:49.440 --> 07:51.440
-I slept through those.
-[officer] Come on, with me.

07:52.520 --> 07:54.440
And I shall sleep through these.

07:56.640 --> 07:58.120
[cell door closes]

07:58.200 --> 08:01.960
You carved your name
on the brick of Longharvest Lane

08:02.560 --> 08:03.920
with the sign from the body.

08:07.800 --> 08:08.760
Why did you?

08:08.840 --> 08:10.840
[gentle music playing]

08:11.440 --> 08:12.320
[softly] I…

08:14.760 --> 08:15.800
left a message.

08:16.600 --> 08:17.600
[Maplewood] For who?

08:20.840 --> 08:21.880
The future.

08:23.280 --> 08:24.360
Alfred.

08:25.760 --> 08:28.080
You left a message for the future.

08:30.760 --> 08:31.800
And here I am.

08:36.960 --> 08:39.240
[dramatic synth music plays]

08:41.600 --> 08:42.680
[grunts]

08:51.440 --> 08:52.880
In the time I come from,

08:54.480 --> 08:57.880
I'm a detective on this same case.

08:58.560 --> 08:59.520
Just like you.

09:02.760 --> 09:06.400
And I've traveled from there
to stop Julian Harker.

09:07.040 --> 09:10.160
He's creating a loop that must be broken.

09:12.240 --> 09:14.200
He's gonna marry your daughter.

09:15.760 --> 09:17.600
She's going to have his child.

09:18.360 --> 09:21.680
-[music fades]
-And so many people are going to die.

09:21.760 --> 09:22.600
Stop!

09:24.080 --> 09:26.720
Stop. Stop this masquerade.

09:27.240 --> 09:28.880
[gentle music playing]

09:28.960 --> 09:31.800
Did Harker send you here? Huh?

09:31.880 --> 09:33.640
To tip me into lunacy?

09:33.720 --> 09:35.200
What is your purpose?!

09:35.280 --> 09:37.440
I just want you to listen to me.

09:38.760 --> 09:39.600
Please.

09:40.520 --> 09:43.600
Then you can choose to believe me or not.

09:48.480 --> 09:50.160
-Okay.
-[Hillinghead gasps softly]

09:50.960 --> 09:52.160
[Maplewood] Shh.

09:54.040 --> 09:56.400
It's not like you have
anywhere better to be.

09:59.480 --> 10:00.560
[both chuckling]

10:08.880 --> 10:12.680
And if we can stop him,
everything would change.

10:13.280 --> 10:14.800
Mannix wouldn't exist.

10:16.640 --> 10:18.360
Defoe's body wouldn't arrive.

10:20.960 --> 10:23.600
None of this would ever have happened.

10:24.720 --> 10:27.760
You'd be whoever you were
before you found the body.

10:29.760 --> 10:30.840
We all would.

10:35.760 --> 10:37.480
Why did you join the police?

10:41.040 --> 10:42.000
To belong.

10:46.560 --> 10:47.520
[scoffs softly]

10:49.880 --> 10:50.800
Why did you?

10:53.240 --> 10:55.800
[exhales] To… To hide.

11:01.360 --> 11:02.560
Why hide?

11:06.840 --> 11:08.040
[Ladbroke] Hillinghead!

11:08.120 --> 11:09.320
[ominous music playing]

11:09.400 --> 11:11.120
[Maplewood] You-- What-- What is it?

11:11.200 --> 11:13.760
I'm to be transferred tonight.

11:14.560 --> 11:17.280
-What? Transferred?
-Mm-hmm.

11:18.120 --> 11:19.880
Already? No. No.

11:19.960 --> 11:21.640
No, no, no, it's too soon.

11:21.720 --> 11:22.920
For what?

11:23.000 --> 11:24.560
[Maplewood] Shit. Okay.

11:24.640 --> 11:25.840
Go on, tell me! Tell me!

11:26.680 --> 11:28.800
You die on the way to prison.

11:29.520 --> 11:31.440
It goes down as suicide.

11:32.040 --> 11:34.320
-You can change this. Please.
-[Ladbroke] Hillinghead.

11:34.400 --> 11:36.000
I'm to escort you to Pentonville.

11:36.080 --> 11:38.280
Please! Please, you've got to talk to him.

11:38.360 --> 11:39.680
Only you can change everything!

11:39.760 --> 11:41.720
[Ladbroke] Ensure you're treated
with some dignity.

[Hillinghead grunts]

No.

-Please. Please.
-[officer] Come on, now.

[music stops]

12:28.080 --> 12:29.320
[door opens]

12:32.920 --> 12:33.760
You.

12:35.880 --> 12:36.760
You're a fool.

12:38.400 --> 12:41.000
You could have let
that journalist take the blame.

12:41.920 --> 12:45.120
But instead, you chose
to sacrifice yourself.

12:46.320 --> 12:47.160
For what?

12:48.320 --> 12:49.200
For love?

12:50.280 --> 12:51.320
Love for him?

12:53.160 --> 12:55.320
There's not much between us, Alfred.

12:57.760 --> 12:59.920
I know what it's like to live a lie.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.040
Stop.

13:01.120 --> 13:03.120
[ominous music playing]

13:05.840 --> 13:06.920
Stop.

13:09.440 --> 13:10.840
You're here to kill me.

13:13.400 --> 13:15.520
I know who you really are.

13:17.960 --> 13:18.960
I know…

13:20.520 --> 13:22.000
everything about you.

13:23.840 --> 13:27.080
I know… the truth about you.

13:27.600 --> 13:28.680
[chuckles softly]

13:28.760 --> 13:31.960
A river of blood
flows through these hands.

13:32.040 --> 13:32.920
[chains rattle]

13:33.640 --> 13:35.200
And you will kill me.

13:37.040 --> 13:39.880
But if I could just see my daughter
one last time,

13:39.960 --> 13:43.080
I would drag her away from you
like a child from a cliff edge

13:43.160 --> 13:46.000
and tell her the truth about what you are.

13:48.840 --> 13:49.720
Why her?

13:52.360 --> 13:53.440
Tell me!

13:57.680 --> 13:58.520
Love?

14:01.680 --> 14:03.840
What could you possibly know of love

14:04.400 --> 14:06.320
when your whole existence negates it?

14:07.560 --> 14:10.960
You don't have a shred
of self-sacrifice in you, do you?

14:11.960 --> 14:15.200
And so you will lie to her.

14:16.840 --> 14:21.680
And, Elias, you will destroy her.

14:21.760 --> 14:23.560
[mysterious music playing]

14:23.640 --> 14:25.400
What did you call me?

14:29.120 --> 14:30.040
Elias.

14:35.400 --> 14:38.280
Elias Mannix.

14:43.480 --> 14:45.120
How do you know that name?

14:45.200 --> 14:47.400
The Morleys lied to you.

14:48.680 --> 14:50.920
And you lied to you.

14:52.240 --> 14:53.880
You won't die loved.

14:56.240 --> 14:59.840
You will die alone, full of regret.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.720
Too weak and afraid to change.

15:08.840 --> 15:10.000
Who told you that?

15:12.920 --> 15:14.400
Spirits, of course.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
[Hillinghead laughing]

15:20.880 --> 15:22.840
Don't you walk away from me.

15:22.920 --> 15:24.920
[melancholy string music playing]

15:27.040 --> 15:27.920
Coward!

15:29.160 --> 15:31.200
Everything you ever believed in!

15:32.240 --> 15:34.360
-Everything!
-[Ladbroke] Hillinghead, enough!

15:34.440 --> 15:36.880
[Hillinghead] Elias! Elias!

15:36.960 --> 15:38.080
It's not too late--

15:38.160 --> 15:40.080
[grunting, choking]

15:43.240 --> 15:44.200
[shudders]

15:54.080 --> 15:55.000
Polly.

15:56.880 --> 15:58.360
I have some bad news.

16:02.360 --> 16:03.400
[music continues]

16:15.040 --> 16:16.960
You said yourself this would be a war,

38:55.520 --> 38:56.640
Whiteman.

39:01.000 --> 39:02.200
You're surrounded.

39:04.440 --> 39:05.360
Come out.

39:06.800 --> 39:07.800
Or die.

39:11.720 --> 39:12.560
Nah.

39:14.280 --> 39:15.240
Come on, Hayden.

39:17.680 --> 39:19.240
The Silk's a copper's pub.

39:21.840 --> 39:23.000
No need to fuck it up.

39:25.200 --> 39:26.120
Come in.

39:28.720 --> 39:30.080
I'll be right with you.

39:30.160 --> 39:33.400

My condolences.

[officer speaks indistinctly]

40:50.120 --> 40:51.040

-[Hasan] Pint?

41:47.600 --> 41:48.480
"Whiteman."

41:56.320 --> 41:57.640
Something's different.

41:58.960 --> 42:00.240
Something's changed.

42:01.800 --> 42:02.960
I can feel it.

42:05.320 --> 42:08.320
-Charles Whiteman…
-A legend. His last case.

42:08.400 --> 42:10.640
Gunned down by fellow officers.

42:11.960 --> 42:13.320
My memories.

42:16.240 --> 42:17.320
No, wait.

42:20.320 --> 42:24.240
The pub, near here. Our old copper's pub.

42:24.320 --> 42:25.600
[police siren wails]

42:28.760 --> 42:32.320
Whiteman wants me to go there.
There's something he wants me to find.

42:34.480 --> 42:36.840
Ah, the Silk! I remembered.

42:37.880 --> 42:39.640
The pub was called The Silk.

42:41.400 --> 42:43.000
-Oh, fuck.
-What?

42:44.800 --> 42:49.320
The pub was destroyed
in the blast 30 years ago.

42:52.480 --> 42:55.720
Look… we've still got The Throat.

43:03.560 --> 43:04.520
Let's go.

43:05.360 --> 43:07.000
I want to know!

43:07.080 --> 43:08.040
Elias!

[distorted whooshing]

43:39.960 --> 43:41.920
[music swells, ends]

43:42.000 --> 43:43.680
There was an unexploded World War II bomb

43:43.760 --> 43:45.880
that was discovered
during an ordnance survey.

43:45.960 --> 43:49.320
It's being dismantled
and we are evacuating the bank for safety.

43:49.400 --> 43:51.280
-[door opens]
-[ominous music playing]

43:53.120 --> 43:55.960
[man on TV] Now,
these pictures have come in

43:56.040 --> 43:57.800
during the last few minutes or so,

43:58.520 --> 44:01.120
showing chaos, uh, in the streets,

44:01.840 --> 44:07.000
as the area
around the private bank is secured…

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
[dramatic music playing]

45:41.120 --> 45:42.000
[exhales]

45:51.000 --> 45:53.480
[Whiteman] Don't believe everything
they say about me.

45:55.080 --> 45:56.320
Here's one good thing.

46:01.560 --> 46:02.640
[music fades]

46:11.040 --> 46:15.440
[man on TV] …Rail and London Transport
services have been badly affected,

46:15.520 --> 46:17.880
and the traffic is still coming
to a standstill.

46:17.960 --> 46:19.400
[gentle music playing]

46:20.000 --> 46:22.600
As you can see by the pictures here,
it's self-evident…

46:22.680 --> 46:23.680
[loud knock at door]

46:23.760 --> 46:27.000
…the area is, uh, being closed off
by the police now.

46:28.360 --> 46:29.240
[sniffles]

46:29.320 --> 46:30.960
Yes, police are…

46:31.040 --> 46:32.600
[knocking at door]

46:32.680 --> 46:35.160
[Hasan] Sarah! I need to talk to you.

46:36.800 --> 46:39.520
[knocking at door] Sarah,
please open the door.

46:41.360 --> 46:43.720
-[knocking continues]
-[music fades]

46:46.280 --> 46:47.320
[panting]

46:48.520 --> 46:49.920
It's Detective Hasan.

46:50.600 --> 46:51.680
Detective Hasan.

46:54.520 --> 46:56.360
[Hasan] Sarah, don't freak out.

47:07.000 --> 47:08.560
[phone ringing, vibrating]

47:11.680 --> 47:14.160
Sarah? You okay?

47:15.080 --> 47:16.840
[woman] Shahara, am I on speaker?

47:16.920 --> 47:18.280
Sarah, is that you?

47:18.360 --> 47:21.720
This isn't Sarah. Take me off speaker,
pull over, and I'll explain.

47:21.800 --> 47:23.080
Please, Shaz, just do it.

47:24.360 --> 47:26.240
-What's going on?
-I don't know.

47:27.200 --> 47:28.760
[children shouting, laughing]

47:28.840 --> 47:29.800
Where's Sarah?

47:29.880 --> 47:30.880
Sarah's safe.

47:30.960 --> 47:32.240
Take me off speaker.

47:32.960 --> 47:34.600
You're off speaker. Who is this?

47:36.320 --> 47:38.280
Shahara, when you see me,

47:38.360 --> 47:40.160
you are going to want to freak out.

47:40.880 --> 47:42.040
Don't.

47:42.120 --> 47:45.360
If you don't recognize me immediately,
you'll hurt my feelings.

47:46.280 --> 47:47.200
Who are you?

47:51.720 --> 47:52.600
You know.

47:54.240 --> 47:56.640
Who is that? What's going on?

47:57.320 --> 47:58.680
There's another trigger.

47:58.760 --> 48:03.320
And all Elias has to do is find a phone,
dial a number, and everybody dies.

48:04.960 --> 48:06.040
Don't spook him.

48:06.640 --> 48:07.800
Don't let him run off.

48:08.760 --> 48:10.080
Nod if you understand.

48:12.000 --> 48:12.840
Okay.

48:13.440 --> 48:15.680
Now, wind down your window,
and those kids,

48:15.760 --> 48:18.120
hovering on those bikes,
spook 'em with the siren.

48:18.200 --> 48:19.920
Tell them to fuck off, just do it.

48:20.800 --> 48:22.800
Shahara, it's not like you don't know how.

48:25.520 --> 48:28.000
Oi, you three. Get lost.

48:28.080 --> 48:29.840
[children laughing]

48:29.920 --> 48:32.800
-[siren wailing]
-Do you want to get arrested? Piss off.

48:34.680 --> 48:35.800
What is going on?

48:36.360 --> 48:37.440
Okay, Shaz.

48:38.720 --> 48:40.120
Now put me on speaker.

48:43.640 --> 48:45.120
Elias, can you hear me?

48:46.560 --> 48:47.520
Who are you?

48:48.600 --> 48:50.320
You figured that out already.

48:52.040 --> 48:52.920
Elias.

48:53.960 --> 48:56.720
I know what Barber gave you.

48:56.800 --> 48:58.720
[gentle music playing]

48:58.800 --> 49:01.040
I know what it is you're about to do.

49:02.720 --> 49:05.880
Where I come from,
you did dial that number.

49:07.080 --> 49:10.360
And hundreds of thousands of people died.

49:12.680 --> 49:14.040
Including my son.

49:15.440 --> 49:16.280
Jawad.

49:16.360 --> 49:17.280
No.

49:18.120 --> 49:21.600
I know that you've been promised
that it will be a better place.

49:21.680 --> 49:25.120
I know that you've been promised love,
that you'll know it.

49:25.920 --> 49:26.760
Feel it.

49:28.080 --> 49:31.240
But you've been lied to by everyone.

49:34.400 --> 49:36.560
I don't expect you to take my word for it,

49:37.680 --> 49:39.240
but maybe you'll take your own.

49:41.560 --> 49:42.680
[Elias gasps softly]

49:42.760 --> 49:44.200
[music fades]

49:51.800 --> 49:53.360
[gentle music playing]

49:55.320 --> 49:58.760
[Mannix] I pray
these truths find you, Elias.

49:59.320 --> 50:03.800
Somehow, they have laid dormant
in me for far too long.

50:04.760 --> 50:09.040
Every word you've ever heard from me
has been a lie.

50:11.640 --> 50:14.760
This isn't fair on you. It never has been.

50:16.600 --> 50:20.400
The sacrifice
I am about to ask you to make

50:20.920 --> 50:24.280
will be the most unfair thing of all.

50:26.600 --> 50:30.000
-No. Sarah, don't.
-Our heart has never healed, Elias.

50:30.520 --> 50:33.200
-Let him finish it.
-The pain is always there.

50:34.720 --> 50:35.720
It's never left.

50:37.240 --> 50:38.480
It's unbearable.

50:40.280 --> 50:41.640
I feel it now.

50:43.240 --> 50:44.800
I still have that dream.

50:44.880 --> 50:45.840
[gasps]

50:47.720 --> 50:48.760
Me…

50:49.680 --> 50:55.480
holding that sick, withered,
frightened boy in my arms.

50:56.000 --> 50:57.600
I can't see his face,

51:00.400 --> 51:04.120
but I know… I have to take his life.

51:05.160 --> 51:06.840
I pray it will be quick,

51:08.520 --> 51:10.000
and painless.

51:10.600 --> 51:14.600
His eyes are filled
with fear and betrayal,

51:15.720 --> 51:17.800
and all I can do is hold him.

51:17.880 --> 51:19.640
[sobbing]

51:19.720 --> 51:23.640
Hold him and let him know he is loved.

51:25.040 --> 51:27.200
It's more than just a dream, Elias.

51:28.440 --> 51:29.480
It's a message.

51:31.440 --> 51:32.560
A message for now.

51:33.720 --> 51:34.600
For us.

51:36.560 --> 51:38.760
And now we know what we must do.

51:38.840 --> 51:41.600
[dramatic music playing]

51:41.680 --> 51:43.040
I'm sorry, my boy.

51:45.520 --> 51:46.640
Please forgive me.

51:49.000 --> 51:51.840
And know you are loved.

51:51.920 --> 51:53.320
