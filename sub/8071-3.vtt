I tell mom and dad about you.

00:20.788 --> 00:21.589
Stay!

00:21.689 --> 00:23.391
I'll go get you some food.

00:35.603 --> 00:36.637
Morning, DJ.

00:42.576 --> 00:43.877
Can I have the car tonight?

00:43.977 --> 00:45.246
Where are you going?

00:45.346 --> 00:47.115
Mother, I'm 17 years old.

00:47.215 --> 00:48.449
You don't have to be
so over-protective.

00:48.549 --> 00:49.650
Yes I do.

00:49.750 --> 00:51.419
I love that car.

00:51.519 --> 00:55.156
Roseanne, remember the
poker game's here tonight.

00:55.256 --> 00:57.125
Why can't you have it
over at Chuckie's house?

00:57.225 --> 00:59.693
Because it's my turn.

00:59.793 --> 01:02.896
What's this?

01:02.996 --> 01:06.400
Dan, I told you it shouldn't
let DJ have that chemistry set.

01:11.739 --> 01:13.741
So what have you got
to say for yourself?

01:13.841 --> 01:17.111
Can I have a dog?

01:17.211 --> 01:18.011
No.

01:18.112 --> 01:18.912
We're not keeping it.

01:19.012 --> 01:20.514
That thing is disgusting.

01:20.614 --> 01:21.915
I'll take care of him.

01:22.015 --> 01:24.785
Well now honey, that's
what you said about the frog,

01:24.885 --> 01:27.388
and the turtle, and the
goldfish, and the little mouse.

01:27.488 --> 01:31.959
And they're all in heaven
now, aren't they honey?

01:32.059 --> 01:34.395
Mom, the dog
stinks worse than DJ.

01:34.495 --> 01:37.698
He does not.

01:37.798 --> 01:40.501
You guys go in the other room
while dad and me talk to DJ,

01:40.601 --> 01:41.402
here.

01:41.502 --> 01:42.303
OK.

01:42.403 --> 01:43.904
Just don't screw
this up, Mother.

01:44.004 --> 01:46.740
And remember Mom,
the frog, the turtle--

01:46.840 --> 01:47.741
this one's too big to flush.

01:51.479 --> 01:53.614
What, did he follow you
home from school or something?

01:53.714 --> 01:54.648
No.

01:54.748 --> 01:57.017
I traded Kenny my
comic books for him.

01:57.117 --> 01:59.887
Well does Kenny's mom know
that he traded away his dog?

01:59.987 --> 02:01.689
She gave me the dog food.

02:05.626 --> 02:07.395
Well I'm really sorry, DJ.

02:07.495 --> 02:09.497
But you're going to have
to take him back, honey.

02:09.597 --> 02:10.564
Why?

02:10.664 --> 02:13.867
Because it's a big
responsibility, DJ.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.269
Your sisters aren't
going to help you.

02:15.369 --> 02:17.238
Me and Daddy are
real busy, you know.

02:17.338 --> 02:19.373
And remember, since
the last time your dad

02:19.473 --> 02:20.741
made that rule, no more pets.

02:20.841 --> 02:22.543
Yeah, you're just a happy boy.

02:22.643 --> 02:24.111
Yes you are.

explain your no more pets rule,

02:33.153 --> 02:34.488
or keep making out with the dog?

02:34.588 --> 02:36.324
Your Mom's right, DJ.

02:36.424 --> 02:37.625
We're going to have
to call Kenny's mom

02:37.725 --> 02:38.692
and have her pick the dog up.

02:38.792 --> 02:39.793
Now take him outside.

02:39.893 --> 02:41.195
It's not fair.

02:45.933 --> 02:47.034
He is cute.

02:47.134 --> 02:49.303

fall in love with anything

02:49.403 --> 02:51.805

02:51.905 --> 02:53.974
Not true, it was the way
you used to kick your leg

02:54.074 --> 02:57.278
when I scratched your tummy.

02:57.378 --> 02:58.879
Hello, Lorraine?

03:01.815 --> 03:03.817
Yeah, your dog's here.

03:03.917 --> 03:05.018
No, I don't blame you at all.

03:05.118 --> 03:08.121
You had to take a shot.

03:08.222 --> 03:10.891
So listen, when can you
come and pick him up?

03:10.991 --> 03:12.393
OK.
I'll see you then.

03:12.493 --> 03:13.294
Thanks.

03:13.394 --> 03:14.395
Bye.

03:14.495 --> 03:15.763
You know, I feel sorry
for that little dog.

03:15.863 --> 03:16.664
Nobody wants him.

03:16.764 --> 03:17.998
He's so pitiful.

That reminds me.

03:19.233 --> 03:20.033
I need to call Jackie.

03:23.371 --> 03:24.638
You know, I'm kind
of worried about her,

03:24.738 --> 03:26.840
because she called her
last night all freaked out

03:26.940 --> 03:28.309
from the Lobo Lounge.

03:28.409 --> 03:31.211
She ran into Gary and
his brand new fiance.

03:31.312 --> 03:32.780
- Gary's getting married?
- Yeah.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.181
She was drunk and everything.

03:34.282 --> 03:36.450
So I made sure they called her a
cab, you know, to get her home.

11:19.279 --> 11:20.547
Oh, well--

11:20.647 --> 11:22.415
I have.

11:22.515 --> 11:25.585
Uh-- but-- well, OK.

11:25.685 --> 11:29.422
When-- when I was a
senior in high school,

11:29.522 --> 11:32.192
I voted for myself
for homecoming queen.

11:36.063 --> 11:38.832
Oh man, I thought you were
going to tell that story

11:38.932 --> 11:40.968
about when in high
school, you wanted to look

11:41.068 --> 11:42.402
like you were really popular.

11:42.502 --> 11:44.838
So you gave yourself a hickey
with the vacuum cleaner.

11:49.409 --> 11:53.747
All right, OK Jackie,
I have one, OK.

11:53.847 --> 11:58.685
[sighs] Uh, this
one time I uh-- uh--

11:58.786 --> 12:04.557
wrote-- wrote this bad check
to the Jerry Lewis Telethon,

12:04.657 --> 12:06.760
just so I could hear him
say my name on television.

12:06.860 --> 12:07.660
Ha ha!

12:07.761 --> 12:09.062
Oh, Roseanne!

12:09.162 --> 12:09.997
You didn't do that.

12:10.097 --> 12:11.431
You know she did.

12:11.531 --> 12:12.365
Ugh!

12:12.465 --> 12:13.767
Oh, Jackie?

12:13.867 --> 12:16.203
OK well, OK um--

12:16.303 --> 12:19.039
I think I got something a
little more on the lines of um,

12:19.139 --> 12:22.275
what you'd call shame.

12:22.375 --> 12:23.844
Back when Duke and
I were drinking,

12:23.944 --> 12:26.413
you know, we kind of like um--

12:26.513 --> 12:27.915
we were short on cash.

12:28.015 --> 12:32.152
And so uh, [sighs] we
robbed a liquor store.

12:32.252 --> 12:33.153
Whoa.

12:33.253 --> 12:34.654
That's deep.

12:34.754 --> 12:35.622
Yeah.

12:35.722 --> 12:36.556
Well, I--

12:36.656 --> 12:39.159
I guess you really
were desperate.

12:39.259 --> 12:45.198
Oh for God's sake, people
rob liquor stores all the time!

12:45.298 --> 12:47.467
I slept with Arnie.

12:47.567 --> 12:49.436
[interposing voices]

12:52.472 --> 12:54.474
You slept with Arnie?

12:54.574 --> 12:55.408
Yeah.

12:55.508 --> 12:56.376
Jackie!

12:56.476 --> 12:57.710
It's out in the open.

13:00.780 --> 13:04.451
So where's all the
supportive stuff?

13:04.551 --> 13:08.221
What the hell
were you thinking?

13:08.321 --> 13:13.626
I was thinking that I just
lost a great guy like Gary.

13:13.726 --> 13:15.062
And now he's gone for good.

13:15.162 --> 13:17.164
And I'll never find
another great guy.

13:17.264 --> 13:18.365
I'm 36 years old.

13:18.465 --> 13:20.800
I've got flabby arm
and pelican neck.

13:20.901 --> 13:22.202
And all my house
plants are dead.

13:22.302 --> 13:23.303
And no one loves me.

13:23.403 --> 13:24.504
But what difference
does that make anyway?

13:24.604 --> 13:25.873
Because everything
in my life sucks!

13:30.844 --> 13:34.447
Well that's still no excuse.

13:34.547 --> 13:36.950
I-- I--

13:37.050 --> 13:39.252
I was drunk, I-- heh.

13:39.352 --> 13:42.055
I-- [coughs]

13:43.556 --> 13:45.458
I made a mistake.

13:45.558 --> 13:48.061
A mistake?

13:48.161 --> 13:49.796
A mistake.

13:49.897 --> 13:52.765
Jackie, do I have to remind
you that when we were all

13:52.866 --> 13:54.734
in high school,
every one of us took

13:54.834 --> 13:57.304
a blood oath that
this man would never

13:57.404 --> 13:58.538
be given the chance to breed?

13:58.638 --> 14:00.140
Oh, boy--

14:00.240 --> 14:02.709
Ah come-- come on, guys.

14:02.809 --> 14:04.644
I uh, thought you were
going to be there for me.

14:04.744 --> 14:05.778
- Jackie--
- Give us-- give us--

14:05.879 --> 14:06.679
I mean--

14:06.779 --> 14:07.580
--a minute, you know.

14:07.680 --> 14:08.481
Here, I--

14:08.581 --> 14:10.083
Oh my god.

14:13.020 --> 14:17.190
Do you realize that everybody
in this town, when they see

14:17.290 --> 14:21.128
me they're going to say, they're
goes the sister of the woman

14:21.228 --> 14:22.362
who slept with Arnie?

14:22.462 --> 14:23.430
[interposing voices]

14:23.530 --> 14:24.731
- People forget--
- No, now.

14:24.831 --> 14:25.698
--Roseanne.

14:25.798 --> 14:28.335
Don't beat yourself
up over this.

14:28.435 --> 14:31.271
[blues music playing]

14:33.806 --> 14:35.608
Hey I'm gonna grab
another beer, anybody else?

14:35.708 --> 14:36.509
Me.

14:36.609 --> 14:37.410
Your bet.

14:37.510 --> 14:38.811
Quarter.

14:38.912 --> 14:40.880
It's really incredible.

14:40.981 --> 14:44.817
I can't believe what
happened last night, to me.

14:44.918 --> 14:46.319
Quarter to you, Arnie.

14:46.419 --> 14:49.222
Well, well, well--

14:49.322 --> 14:53.961
a gallon of mayo, a gallon
of pickle chips, and yes,

14:54.061 --> 14:55.795
it looks like a tub of Rob
Bell's famous coleslaw.

14:59.266 --> 15:02.735
Just like in my
refrigerator at home, man.

15:02.835 --> 15:03.937
OK I'll tell you guys.

15:04.037 --> 15:05.438
I'll tell you.

15:05.538 --> 15:08.841
Last night, this really
gorgeous chick came on to me.

15:08.942 --> 15:10.477
Who was she this time, Arnie?

15:10.577 --> 15:11.378
A model?

15:11.478 --> 15:12.279
A movie star?

15:12.379 --> 15:13.413
Nah, this time she was real.

15:13.513 --> 15:14.647
Come on.
Cut it out.

15:14.747 --> 15:15.582
Lonnie--

15:15.682 --> 15:17.084
Yeah, like you'd'
cheat on Nancy.

15:17.184 --> 15:18.418
I did.

15:18.518 --> 15:19.719
You're not kidding.

15:19.819 --> 15:22.089
No.

15:22.189 --> 15:23.923
What is the matter
with you, man?

15:24.024 --> 15:25.158
You just got Nancy back.

15:25.258 --> 15:27.194
Well-- well this
woman wanted me.

15:27.294 --> 15:30.263
And you guys know that
that never happens.

15:30.363 --> 15:32.865
Arnie, you're engaged.
You just don't do it.

15:32.966 --> 15:34.734
Hm, Nancy's been
real good to you.

15:34.834 --> 15:35.868
It's not right, man.

15:35.969 --> 15:37.470
Oh don't act like I'm
some kind of criminal.

15:37.570 --> 15:39.672
Any one of you guys would've
done the exact same thing.

15:39.772 --> 15:40.407
- Ah, no.
- No way.

15:40.507 --> 15:41.474
- No, no.
- No way.

15:41.574 --> 15:42.609
- Yeah, you're just--
- Forget about it.

15:42.709 --> 15:43.276
--saying that because
you guys are married.

15:43.376 --> 15:44.111
And you're whipped.

15:44.211 --> 15:46.546
He's got you there, Chuckie.

15:46.646 --> 15:48.215
Hey Leon, you're not married.

15:48.315 --> 15:49.816
Help me out here.

15:49.916 --> 15:52.952
Let's say Melanie Griffith
wants you really bad.

15:53.053 --> 15:54.087
Are you going to tell her no?

15:54.187 --> 15:56.723
Well um, actually
I would say no.

15:56.823 --> 15:57.824
The hell you would!

15:57.924 --> 15:59.026
You a lying--
[interposing voices]

15:59.126 --> 16:01.061
- --dog.
- No, no, no--

16:01.161 --> 16:02.395
guys, I'm-- I'm serious.

16:02.495 --> 16:04.064
Sure you are, Leon.

16:04.164 --> 16:05.065
Ha ha!

16:05.165 --> 16:06.566
Come on.

16:06.666 --> 16:08.035
Didn't-- didn't
Roseanne tell you?

16:08.135 --> 16:09.836
- Tell me what?
- That I'm gay.

16:15.708 --> 16:18.045
Heh heh heh heh.

16:18.145 --> 16:19.446
Huh.

16:19.546 --> 16:20.347
Yeah, right.

16:20.447 --> 16:21.248
Right.

16:21.348 --> 16:22.215
That's funny.

16:22.315 --> 16:23.116
Aw yeah.

16:23.216 --> 16:24.717
Jeez, I-- I thought you knew.

16:27.954 --> 16:29.689
No.

16:29.789 --> 16:32.792
No I mean, you know, it's OK.

16:32.892 --> 16:34.894
It happens.

16:34.994 --> 16:36.363
Yeah, it did.

16:39.332 --> 16:41.134
[whistling]

16:42.669 --> 16:45.905
Well-- well-- well,
you-- you know, um, I--

16:46.005 --> 16:48.975
I-- I-- know a gay guy.

16:49.076 --> 16:51.178
Uh, his-- his name's Bill.

16:51.278 --> 16:52.345
He-- he-- he lives in Chicago.

16:52.445 --> 16:55.882
Hey, m-- m-- maybe you know him?

16:55.982 --> 16:57.250
Yeah.

16:57.350 --> 16:59.519
Yeah sure, I know him,
from Chicago, gay Bill.

17:02.689 --> 17:05.358
Smooth, Chuckie.

17:05.458 --> 17:06.526
What?

17:06.626 --> 17:09.329
Nobody else was saying anything.

17:09.429 --> 17:10.830
Say, I got an idea.

17:10.930 --> 17:12.099
Let's play cards.
- Thank you.

17:12.199 --> 17:12.999
Who's bet?

17:13.100 --> 17:13.933
OK, who's next?

17:14.033 --> 17:15.135
OK Leo-- Leon--

17:15.235 --> 17:16.203
forget about Melanie Griffith.

17:16.303 --> 17:18.805
Let's say Andy
Griffith hits on you.

17:18.905 --> 17:21.208
[interposing voices]

17:21.308 --> 17:24.077
[upbeat music playing]

17:27.514 --> 17:29.449
I'm going to make
some big changes, Dan.

17:29.549 --> 17:30.983
From now on, you're
going to see a new Arnie.

17:31.084 --> 17:32.119
You're going to tell Nancy?

17:32.219 --> 17:33.253
Hell no.

17:33.353 --> 17:36.923
The new Arnie wouldn't
rat out the old Arnie.

17:37.023 --> 17:38.825
Well, hi Arnie.

17:38.925 --> 17:39.759
I've got to go.

17:39.859 --> 17:40.827
Oh wait!
Wait a minute.

17:40.927 --> 17:41.894
I'll help you to--
- I know where it is.

17:41.994 --> 17:43.062
--your car.
Oh no--

17:43.163 --> 17:43.896
- Ow, ow--
- I insist--

17:43.996 --> 17:44.597
--that hurts.
That hurts.

17:44.697 --> 17:45.565
- Allow me.
- Ow.

17:45.665 --> 17:47.167
You took advantage
of my sister.

17:47.267 --> 17:48.268
And for that you must die!

17:48.368 --> 17:53.173
Rosie, no one took
advantage of anybody.

17:53.273 --> 17:54.907
She was drunk and depressed.

17:55.007 --> 17:58.178
A lot of women are
like that around me.

17:58.278 --> 17:59.879
So did you tell anybody?
Did you--

17:59.979 --> 18:00.647
- No.
- --tell Dan?

18:00.747 --> 18:01.448
No, I swear.

18:01.548 --> 18:02.715
Because I'll tell you what.

18:02.815 --> 18:04.851
If you breathe a word of
this to anybody in this town,

18:04.951 --> 18:06.986
I'm going to tell Nancy.

18:07.086 --> 18:09.256
Don't do that, please.

18:09.356 --> 18:13.460
You stay away from my sister.

18:13.560 --> 18:16.863
Did you clear that with her?

18:16.963 --> 18:18.298
Get out!

18:25.638 --> 18:28.741
Hey honey, how come you
didn't tell me Leon was gay?

18:28.841 --> 18:29.776
What difference does it make?

18:29.876 --> 18:30.677
You're all pigs.

Hi.

18:52.865 --> 18:54.066
Yeah, why?

18:54.167 --> 18:55.101
Why?

18:55.202 --> 18:56.336
Who do you think is
going to be here?

18:56.436 --> 18:57.370
God knows.

19:00.540 --> 19:01.341
Sorry.

19:01.441 --> 19:03.310
How are you doing?
- OK.

19:03.410 --> 19:04.677
Yeah?

19:04.777 --> 19:08.315
Um, are you mad at me?

19:08.415 --> 19:09.682
Why?

19:09.782 --> 19:15.622
Well I figure, you know, what
you did with Arnie, that was

19:15.722 --> 19:17.424
kind of like a cry for help.

19:17.524 --> 19:19.892
More like a scream.

19:19.992 --> 19:21.394
Yeah and-- and I--

19:21.494 --> 19:22.762
I wasn't listening.

19:22.862 --> 19:24.931
And I-- I just want to apologize
for being a jerk last night.

19:25.031 --> 19:28.000
Oh I'm the jerk, Roseanne.

19:28.100 --> 19:30.102
I screwed up my own life.

19:30.203 --> 19:34.006
And I can't believe you, or mom,
or Arnie, or Gary, or anybody.

19:34.106 --> 19:35.007
Well mom--

19:37.644 --> 19:40.480
Figure out what's wrong
with my life, and fix it.

19:40.580 --> 19:43.483
And first off, I
am going to stop

19:43.583 --> 19:45.184
thinking that my life
is not going to be

19:45.285 --> 19:46.919
complete unless I find a man.

19:47.019 --> 19:48.288
Good for you.

19:48.388 --> 19:49.622
Yeah.

19:49.722 --> 19:51.090
And I figured out what I'm
going to do about a job, too.

19:51.190 --> 19:52.058
Yeah?

19:52.158 --> 19:53.293
Something I can
be really proud of,

19:53.393 --> 19:54.727
you know, like when I was a cop.

19:54.827 --> 19:56.363
What?

19:56.463 --> 20:02.902
Well it's-- it sounds a little
bit crazy, but there's a school

20:03.002 --> 20:03.970
over in Elgin--

20:04.070 --> 20:05.905
Oh you want to
go back to school?

20:06.005 --> 20:07.139
I think that's great.

20:07.240 --> 20:10.109
It's a trucking
school, Roseanne.

20:10.209 --> 20:12.279
I want to learn how
to drive the big rigs.

20:16.849 --> 20:19.719
The big rigs?

20:19.819 --> 20:21.721
I-- I never thought of that.

20:21.821 --> 20:24.791
Yeah, you're your own boss.
You make great money.

20:24.891 --> 20:25.692
You get to travel.

20:25.792 --> 20:27.059
Well go for it.

20:27.159 --> 20:28.194
Yeah.

20:28.295 --> 20:30.863
I wanted to get a little
more thought, you know,

20:30.963 --> 20:32.098
before I just dive
right in to it.

20:32.198 --> 20:33.566
Why?
You want to do it.

20:33.666 --> 20:34.467
Do it.

20:34.567 --> 20:35.368
Really?

20:35.468 --> 20:36.669
Yeah, really.

20:36.769 --> 20:40.106
You know, Elgin it-- it's
only like an hour from here.

20:40.206 --> 20:41.741
Let's go.

20:41.841 --> 20:42.709
Yeah, now.

20:42.809 --> 20:43.776

20:43.876 --> 20:45.011
We'll go and we'll
get you signed up.

20:45.111 --> 20:46.279
Come on, I'll drive.

20:46.379 --> 20:47.280
- Yeah, I think.

Let's go.

20:48.281 --> 20:50.750
Aw Roseanne, aw thanks.

20:50.850 --> 20:51.818
It's good.

20:51.918 --> 20:52.985

20:53.986 --> 20:57.724

Hello, Lorraine.

21:05.965 --> 21:08.267
It's Roseanne.

21:08.368 --> 21:10.269
Don't give me that
no habla ingles crap.

21:10.370 --> 21:12.839
I know it's you, Lorraine.

21:12.939 --> 21:16.108
Now how come you didn't
come and get this dog?

21:16.208 --> 21:18.044
Oh right, like
Kenny has the mumps.

21:18.144 --> 21:19.712
I really believe that.

21:19.812 --> 21:21.514
And stop going
[static sound] like it's

21:21.614 --> 21:22.815
a bad connection, Lorraine.

21:22.915 --> 21:24.951
I know it's you.

21:25.051 --> 21:26.285
You know, I'm just
going to get this dog

21:26.386 --> 21:28.588
and bring him right over to
your house and drop him off.

21:28.688 --> 21:30.857
And you better not do what
you did last time neither.

21:30.957 --> 21:33.760
I knew you were
too home, Lorraine.

21:33.860 --> 21:37.464
Soon as I got up to the door
and the lights went off.

21:37.564 --> 21:39.666
They are not security
lights, Lorraine.

21:39.766 --> 21:41.133
Security lights
don't go out when

21:41.233 --> 21:43.736
someone comes up to the door.

21:43.836 --> 21:45.237
Lorraine?

21:45.338 --> 21:46.739

21:46.839 --> 21:47.640
