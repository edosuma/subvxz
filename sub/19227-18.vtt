TOM: Big weekend, girls.
Gotta make this place sparkle.

00:06.101 --> 00:08.802
Time to clean the fish tank.

00:08.837 --> 00:10.571
Do I have to wear this?

00:10.631 --> 00:12.331
I'm not the best with
hand-eye coordination,

00:12.366 --> 00:13.565
and you're taking away one of the two.

00:13.601 --> 00:15.401
You need a heightened sense of taste.

00:15.436 --> 00:16.735
The big fishing
tournament's this weekend,

00:16.771 --> 00:19.772
and I want to try
some cutting-edge flavors.

00:19.807 --> 00:22.608
Mm. I'm getting cantaloupe...

00:22.643 --> 00:24.510
and a hint of kiwi.

00:24.545 --> 00:26.378
I'm calling that one Melonardo Dicaprio.

00:26.414 --> 00:28.480
Try the next one.
I'll get you some more.

00:28.516 --> 00:29.715
Hey, Dad, you want one?

00:29.750 --> 00:31.550
Sure.

00:35.823 --> 00:37.523
It tastes like low tide.

00:37.558 --> 00:39.458
Uh... yeah.

00:39.493 --> 00:43.395
I'm calling that one Algae-gi Hadid.

00:44.428 --> 00:47.229
You guys have a good weekend.

00:48.433 --> 00:50.266
Guys, check it out.

00:50.302 --> 00:51.467
Colt Bailey's in the store.

00:53.571 --> 00:55.271
Colt Bailey?

00:55.307 --> 00:57.240
Why do I know him?

00:57.275 --> 00:58.574
Oh, is that our worm delivery guy?

00:58.610 --> 01:00.376
Seriously? Look around.

01:04.382 --> 01:06.316
To be fair, you don't pay attention

01:06.351 --> 01:08.351
to people who are
famous in the slushy world.

01:08.386 --> 01:10.353
Colt Bailey is the premier
athlete of his sport.

01:10.388 --> 01:12.221
<i>Tails and Scales</i> magazine just named him

01:12.257 --> 01:14.390
elite fisherman of the year.

01:14.426 --> 01:16.592
Don't let him leave. I'm gonna
see if he'll sign a life jacket.

01:20.565 --> 01:23.333
Welcome to the Bait and Bite.

01:23.368 --> 01:26.536
Can I interest you in
a Colt Bailey thermos?

01:29.274 --> 01:32.508
I guess any thermos you use
becomes a Colt Bailey thermos.

01:32.544 --> 01:36.212
Harley, stop it, stop it right now.

01:36.247 --> 01:37.580
It is such an honor
to have you at our store.

01:37.615 --> 01:39.248
I mean, my dad's store.

01:39.284 --> 01:41.417
Well, the family store.

01:41.453 --> 01:43.252
Georgie, stop it, stop it right now.

01:43.288 --> 01:44.520
Thanks.

01:44.556 --> 01:46.422
Hey, maybe you can help me.

01:46.458 --> 01:48.324
I signed up for the tournament late,

01:48.360 --> 01:49.425
and I don't have a place to stay.

01:49.461 --> 01:51.294
Every hotel in town is booked.

01:51.329 --> 01:52.595
I'd be willing to pay top dollar.

01:54.432 --> 01:55.631
Top dollar?

01:55.667 --> 01:57.600
My two favorite words.

01:57.635 --> 01:59.635
If I can get Colt to rent our house,

01:59.671 --> 02:02.171
we can finally afford
our dream vacation.

02:02.207 --> 02:03.573
Hawaii.

02:03.608 --> 02:05.608
We've been trying to save up for years.

02:07.512 --> 02:09.412
That's why I created the Honolu-loot.

02:09.447 --> 02:11.514
We put birthday money,
babysitting money,

02:11.549 --> 02:13.449
other people's wishes from the fountain

02:13.485 --> 02:15.218
at the mall money,

02:15.253 --> 02:17.553

to that magical island.

02:17.589 --> 02:20.189
Unfortunately, when it comes
to saving money,

02:20.225 --> 02:22.325
our family is its own worst enemy.

02:22.360 --> 02:25.361
TOM: Who put a stapler
down the garbage disposal?

02:25.397 --> 02:28.631
Why is there a hamburger patty
in the DVD player?

02:28.666 --> 02:30.233

Beast!

02:31.569 --> 02:33.469
Daphne!

02:33.505 --> 02:36.606
But now, with the terror trio
away with Mom,

02:36.641 --> 02:40.410
we could finally earn the money
quicker than they can lose it.

02:40.445 --> 02:43.613
When the Littles are away,
the Bigs can get paid.

02:47.519 --> 02:49.385
I know a place you can rent.

02:49.421 --> 02:51.487
It's a two-story house
not far from here.

02:51.523 --> 02:53.423
Sleeps nine; I've stayed
there many times.

02:53.458 --> 02:54.690
Sounds great.

02:57.262 --> 02:59.262
That sounds a lot like our house.

02:59.297 --> 03:00.396
That's because it is.

03:00.432 --> 03:02.498
We're finally gonna fill

Wow, Colt Bailey. It is such an
honor to have you in our store.

04:13.538 --> 04:17.173

04:17.208 --> 04:18.641
Dad, stop it. Stop it right now.

04:18.676 --> 04:20.576
Happy to. I've signed life vests,

04:20.612 --> 04:23.179

04:35.226 --> 04:38.594
A guy that is paying top
dollar is wearing that vest?

04:38.630 --> 04:41.297
I don't care what he's wearing,

04:41.332 --> 04:44.267

04:49.274 --> 04:51.340
Time to seal the deal.

04:55.413 --> 04:57.280
So I checked up on the rental.

04:57.315 --> 04:59.315
There was a family
planning on staying there,

04:59.350 --> 05:01.150
but I managed to free it up.

05:01.186 --> 05:03.619

your own brand of fish food?

05:06.558 --> 05:08.491
I'm catching what you're casting.

05:08.526 --> 05:11.327
But I don't know about
staying in a private home.

05:11.362 --> 05:13.496
The good thing about a hotel
is I've got a whole staff

05:13.531 --> 05:16.199
- to back me up.
- Don't worry.

05:16.234 --> 05:18.501
This rental comes with
a top-notch staff.

05:18.536 --> 05:20.436
Right?

05:20.471 --> 05:22.405
- Right.
- And that would be...

05:22.440 --> 05:24.407
- Us.
- Yes, us.

- Like maybe redesigning that vest.
- Rachel!

So do we have a deal?

05:38.323 --> 05:40.489

that's actually cherry gelatin,

Rise and shine. It's 4:30.

Everyone starts early on tournament day.

10:44.505 --> 10:46.605
(BOAT HORN BLARES)

10:52.380 --> 10:54.380
Morning, Landlord Harley.

10:54.415 --> 10:56.548
Don't mean to be a snag in your line,

10:56.584 --> 10:58.450
but we need to chat.

10:58.486 --> 11:01.253
Last night when I locked up,

11:01.289 --> 11:04.290
I saw you did not have
a home security system.

11:04.325 --> 11:06.458
We don't, but Marshport's really safe.

11:06.494 --> 11:09.361
One time, they left the front
page of the paper blank

11:09.397 --> 11:11.163
because nothing was going on.

11:11.198 --> 11:13.465
Yeah, but I've got fans. Groupies.

11:13.501 --> 11:15.534
Don't you mean groupers?

11:15.569 --> 11:17.403
Sorry. It's early.

11:17.438 --> 11:20.439
I need to sleep soundly if
I'm gonna win this tournament.

11:20.474 --> 11:23.108
I'm afraid if you don't
get me an alarm system

11:23.144 --> 11:24.476
by tonight, I'll have to find
somewhere else to stay.

11:24.512 --> 11:27.112
No, no. I'll take care of it.

11:27.148 --> 11:28.447
The last family that lived there

11:28.482 --> 11:30.282
relied on their youngest
daughter for protection.

11:30.318 --> 11:32.151
I won't be troubling you again.

11:32.186 --> 11:33.485
Water's calling.

11:41.195 --> 11:43.462
Landlord Harley, one more thing.

11:43.497 --> 11:45.364
Don't mean to be a snag in your line,

11:45.399 --> 11:48.434
but I'm here to drop off my little pup.

11:50.271 --> 11:51.570
Little? Compared to what?

11:51.605 --> 11:53.539
Compared to that marlin
I caught last week,

11:53.574 --> 11:55.407
Guppy is tiny.

11:55.443 --> 11:57.276
That's not a problem, right?

11:57.311 --> 12:00.145
You did promise a top-notch staff.

12:00.181 --> 12:02.414
I believe your words were
"the toppest of notches."

12:02.450 --> 12:06.385
Georgie's, but still,
I can handle the dog.

12:06.420 --> 12:08.420
And get you an alarm in a day.

12:08.456 --> 12:10.489
I got this, Harls.

12:10.524 --> 12:12.224
Big's got your back.

12:12.259 --> 12:14.259
You're gonna be with him all day, right?

12:14.295 --> 12:15.361
He doesn't like to be alone.

12:15.396 --> 12:17.563
I come from a family of nine.

12:17.598 --> 12:19.298
I don't know what alone is.

12:19.333 --> 12:21.533
Come on, boy.

12:24.171 --> 12:26.372
All right.

12:26.407 --> 12:29.241
Water's calling.

12:35.549 --> 12:38.384
Landlord Harley, one more thing.

12:38.419 --> 12:40.586
Don't mean to be a snag in your line,

12:40.621 --> 12:43.188
but that kitchen has a problem.

12:44.458 --> 12:47.192
It's about as clean as it's ever been,

12:47.228 --> 12:49.194
so can't wait to hear this.

12:49.230 --> 12:52.264
It's gonna sound crazy,
but I'd like you to remove

12:52.299 --> 12:53.599
all the fish and fish-related
products in there.

12:53.634 --> 12:56.168
I'd do it myself, but it's bad luck

12:56.203 --> 12:58.270
to touch any fish
before you actually catch some.

12:58.305 --> 13:00.305
That doesn't sound crazy at all.

13:00.341 --> 13:02.341
Athletes are superstitious.

13:02.376 --> 13:05.344
Football star Brady Rice keeps all
his food in alphabetical order.

13:05.379 --> 13:07.212
That's crazy.

13:07.248 --> 13:09.148
But then again, who am I
to argue with a world champion?

13:09.183 --> 13:11.383
Interesting.

13:11.419 --> 13:15.087
Landlord Harley, I'm gonna
need the pantry alphabetized.

13:15.122 --> 13:17.256
If it's good enough for Brady,
it's good enough for Bailey.

13:17.291 --> 13:20.559
What a helpful idea... Georgie.

13:20.594 --> 13:23.362
I'll just add alphabetizing to my list.

13:23.397 --> 13:25.230
Our list. I'll take care of that.

13:25.266 --> 13:28.200
I know a little something
about superstition in sports.

13:28.235 --> 13:31.270
I never wash my game socks
during a season.

13:31.305 --> 13:33.372
That's not superstitious,
that's just unsanitary.

13:33.407 --> 13:35.507
Anyway...

13:35.543 --> 13:37.543
water's calling.

13:40.481 --> 13:42.214
Landlord Harley, don't mean to be a...

13:42.249 --> 13:44.416
BOTH: Snag in your line.

13:44.452 --> 13:46.185
Hey, how did you know
I was gonna say that?

13:46.220 --> 13:48.287
Water called, gave me a heads up.

13:48.322 --> 13:50.556
This might be beyond
the scope of your services,

13:50.591 --> 13:54.226
but I'm gonna need someone to
prepare some fresh bait for me.

13:54.261 --> 13:56.361
I'll do it. I'll do it.

13:56.397 --> 13:58.130
Much obliged.

13:58.165 --> 13:59.465
I'll need worms,
crawdads and sand fleas.

13:59.500 --> 14:02.401
I'm your girl.
I love everything fishing,

14:02.436 --> 14:05.337
- and fishing-ish.
- Great, thanks.

14:05.372 --> 14:07.105
Also, if you can get out
this snag in my line,

14:07.141 --> 14:08.373
I'd appreciate it.

14:08.409 --> 14:10.375
Since when do you offer to help,

14:10.411 --> 14:12.511
especially when it involves
gills and guts?

14:12.546 --> 14:15.214
Since I overheard Colt's going fishing

14:15.249 --> 14:18.250
with Ryan Reynolds, and I want to go.

14:20.120 --> 14:22.120
Look at us Bigs, doing our part.

14:22.156 --> 14:25.457
We step up, and without
those three little anchors,

14:25.493 --> 14:27.526
we can fly.

14:31.565 --> 14:33.532
(ELECTRONIC BEEPING)

14:33.567 --> 14:35.400
You are looking at the lock squawk.

14:35.436 --> 14:37.169
It's a voice-activated lock

14:37.204 --> 14:39.338
you customize with your own password.

14:39.373 --> 14:41.340
I started inventing it
for the girls' room,

14:41.375 --> 14:43.375
but this will be a good test run.

14:43.410 --> 14:46.311
And once I set this password,

14:46.347 --> 14:47.513
Hawaii, here we come.

14:47.548 --> 14:49.481
GEORGIE: Harley, I have an emergency!

14:49.517 --> 14:52.317
It's probably not nice
to say this about your sister,

14:52.353 --> 14:54.520
but she better be bleeding.

14:57.324 --> 14:59.324
That's a good boy.

14:59.360 --> 15:01.360
Who's a good boy?

15:01.395 --> 15:04.296
You're not gonna poop on Uncle
Ethan's shoes anymore, are you?

15:04.331 --> 15:06.164
No.

15:06.200 --> 15:08.233
Do you mind if I take
a picture with you really quick

15:08.269 --> 15:11.136
to post on my feed?
If I tag it "Colt Bailey's dog,"

15:11.171 --> 15:13.505
I could really get a boost in followers.

15:13.541 --> 15:16.408
All right. You didn't say no.

15:20.114 --> 15:22.414
This alphabetizing thing is not easy.

15:22.449 --> 15:24.249
Do I put this under "R" for rigatoni,

15:24.285 --> 15:25.484
or "P" for pasta?

15:25.519 --> 15:28.320
I'd file it under "N"
for not an emergency.

15:28.355 --> 15:30.222
Then there's this jelly situation.

15:30.257 --> 15:32.190
I mean, is this jelly or jam?

15:32.226 --> 15:34.493
- The label says preserves.
- Preserves!

15:34.528 --> 15:36.395
Then there's this mind-bender.

15:36.430 --> 15:38.263
Half peanut butter, half jelly.

15:38.299 --> 15:40.365
Put it under "S" for swirl.

15:40.401 --> 15:43.101
I am so glad you are here.

15:45.506 --> 15:47.139
I never thought you'd ask.

18:07.598 --> 18:10.232
You can't leave fish guts
in Colt's shower.

It'll make him feel at home.

And if you wanna be
mad at someone, be mad at Ethan.

18:14.405 --> 18:16.538
Why?

18:16.574 --> 18:18.574
You posted Colt's phone number?

18:18.609 --> 18:21.343
No, just pictures of me and Guppy.

18:21.379 --> 18:24.346
Colt's personal cell phone
number was on the dog tag.

Oh, that's why I have
2,000 new followers.

18:28.319 --> 18:30.486

all this bad luck.

it wouldn't have happened.

He's probably been swallowed
by a whale by now.

18:35.526 --> 18:38.494
This better not affect my shot of
going fishing with Ryan Reynolds.

18:38.529 --> 18:41.330
You're going fishing with
Colt's dog groomer?

18:41.365 --> 18:43.532
- What?
- Ryan Reynolds.

18:43.567 --> 18:45.545
That's Colt's dog groomer's name.

18:45.570 --> 18:49.271
He's this guy.
He's following me now, too.

- That's it, I quit.
- You can't.

18:56.614 --> 18:59.215
You're supposed to be doing
bait prep for Colt.

18:59.250 --> 19:02.151
Yeah, and you're supposed
to be doing house prep.

19:02.186 --> 19:03.385
But look at this place.

19:03.421 --> 19:05.421
And anyone could look at this place,

19:05.456 --> 19:07.423
because Harley's security system

19:07.458 --> 19:10.459
- let me and Ethan walk right in here.
- I didn't lock it yet.

19:10.494 --> 19:13.295
Colt asked us to do four things,
and we haven't done any right.

19:13.331 --> 19:15.431
- Five things.
- We can't even get that right.

19:15.466 --> 19:19.535
Guys, all of this arguing
isn't getting us to Hawaii.

19:21.472 --> 19:23.505
