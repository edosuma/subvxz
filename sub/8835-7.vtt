IF THAT CRAB COULD SNAP A STICK IN TWO.
YOU SCARED HIM OFF.

04:37.195 --> 04:40.782

ON THE STORE STEPS.

YOU GET TO EAT?

THAN THE OTHER.

I'LL TELL YOU,

23:18.315 --> 23:23.403
I DON'T KNOW IF I'VE GOT AN ANSWER
THAT WILL SATISFY EITHER ONE OF US.

23:26.573 --> 23:29.117
SOME FOLKS JUST COME
INTO THE WORLD THAT WAY.

23:29.284 --> 23:32.496
I DON'T KNOW WHY. I DON'T THINK
ANYBODY ELSE DOES, EITHER.

23:32.662 --> 23:34.748
I DO KNOW THAT
MOST OF THEM

23:34.915 --> 23:37.876
SEEM TO BE BORN WITH
SOME EXTRA-SPECIAL GIFT.

23:38.043 --> 23:39.544
IS GUMPTION A GIFT?

23:39.711 --> 23:41.129

23:41.296 --> 23:43.465
I'M SURE OLGA
HAS GUMPTION.

YOU'VE TOLD US,

23:45.634 --> 23:47.385

A BIG HEART, TOO.

23:47.552 --> 23:50.722
AND A HEART IS MORE IMPORTANT
THAN A LEG, ISN'T IT?

23:50.889 --> 23:53.683
A LOT MORE IMPORTANT.

23:53.850 --> 23:56.353
YOU'VE BEEN THINKING A LOT ABOUT

LEG WILL GET BETTER.

24:03.151 --> 24:04.569

THE OTHER DAY,

24:04.736 --> 24:07.322
WE WERE WALKING PAST
HANSON'S MILL,

24:07.489 --> 24:10.992
AND SHE STEPPED ON THIS PLANK
AND DIDN'T LIMP AT ALL.

24:12.410 --> 24:13.411
SHE WHAT?

24:13.578 --> 24:16.248
THERE WAS THIS PLANK
ABOUT SO THICK...

24:16.414 --> 24:17.415
MM-HMM?

24:17.582 --> 24:19.084
AND SHE STEPPED ON IT
WITH HER SHORT LEG.

24:19.251 --> 24:20.877
AND SHE WALKED
THE WHOLE LENGTH OF IT?

24:21.044 --> 24:24.673
YES. AND WHEN SHE COULD STEP
ON IT WITH HER SHORT LEG,

24:24.840 --> 24:26.675
SHE DIDN'T LIMP
AT ALL.

24:30.595 --> 24:32.722
IF THERE WERE ENOUGH
PLANKS SCATTERED AROUND,

24:32.889 --> 24:36.893
SHE'D BE ABLE TO RUN AND
PLAY LIKE THE REST OF US.

24:37.060 --> 24:39.855
YEAH, I BET SHE COULD.

TO MEETING YOU.

SHE WANTS TO MEET OLGA, TOO.

PRETTY BUSY,

OF YOU, IF I MIGHT.

25:34.201 --> 25:35.160

COULD YOU FOLLOW?

25:44.252 --> 25:45.337

25:45.503 --> 25:47.505

TO SPEAK TO YOU.

25:50.550 --> 25:51.843
MR. NORDSTROM.

25:53.345 --> 25:57.265
MY DAUGHTER LAURA HAS MADE QUITE
A FRIEND IN YOUR DAUGHTER OLGA.

26:00.352 --> 26:02.270
ACTUALLY,
OLGA'S WHY I'M HERE.

26:04.940 --> 26:08.693
THIS IS GOING TO COME OUT A
LITTLE BIT AWKWARD, BUT, UH...

26:08.860 --> 26:13.240
I'VE GOT A PRETTY GOOD HORSE, AND IF
I DON'T FIX HER SHOE JUST PROPER,

26:13.406 --> 26:14.866
SHE COMES UP LAME.

26:15.033 --> 26:20.038
A SPECIAL SHOE IS THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN BEING SOUND AND LAME.

26:20.205 --> 26:22.123
THAT GOT ME TO THINKING.

26:22.290 --> 26:26.753
WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS, I'D LIKE
PERMISSION TO WORK ON ONE OF OLGA'S SHOES.

26:26.920 --> 26:29.381
YOU'VE GOT A MIRACLE
IN YOUR POCKET, HUH?

26:29.547 --> 26:32.801
NO. I TOLD YOU THIS WAS GOING TO SOUND
AWKWARD, BUT I THINK IF I COULD--

26:32.968 --> 26:35.512
OLGA WAS BORN
WITH A LAME LEG.

26:38.014 --> 26:40.684
WE ACCEPT THAT.
SO DOES SHE.

26:42.727 --> 26:44.771
WE'VE GOT A SAYING IN THIS
PART OF THE COUNTRY--

26:44.938 --> 26:47.148
THE LORD HELPS THOSE
THAT HELP THEMSELVES.

26:47.315 --> 26:49.859
I'LL TAKE CARE
OF OLGA MYSELF.

26:50.026 --> 26:51.861
I DON'T NEED YOUR HELP.

27:03.456 --> 27:04.749
MR. NORDSTROM,

27:04.916 --> 27:07.711
YOUR DAUGHTER WATCHES THE
OTHER CHILDREN RUN AND PLAY.

27:07.877 --> 27:10.463
SHE SEEMS TO DO IT
WITH A HAPPY HEART,

27:10.630 --> 27:11.881
AND THAT'S
TO HER CREDIT.

27:14.342 --> 27:16.970
I REALLY THINK IF YOU GAVE ME
PERMISSION TO WORK ON THAT SHOE,

27:17.137 --> 27:19.306
SHE MIGHT GET A CHANCE TO
DO SOME RUNNING HERSELF.

27:19.472 --> 27:23.351
I DID NOT SEND FOR YOU.
I DO NOT WANT YOU HERE.

27:23.518 --> 27:25.937
I'LL THANK YOU
TO GET OFF MY PROPERTY.

27:26.104 --> 27:28.606
I DON'T SEE WHAT HARM IT WOULD
DO TO GIVE ME A CHANCE--

27:28.773 --> 27:29.941
GOOD-BYE.

27:39.034 --> 27:41.369
A PLEASURE MEETING YOU,
MRS. NORDSTROM.

27:43.621 --> 27:44.956
COULD YOU HAVE DONE IT?

27:45.123 --> 27:48.293
COULD YOU HAVE MADE A SHOE
THAT WOULD HAVE HELPED OLGA?

27:48.460 --> 27:49.669
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

27:49.836 --> 27:52.964
SHE WOULDN'T BE ANY WORSE
OFF THAN SHE IS NOW.

27:53.131 --> 27:54.758
JUST A STUBBORN MAN.

27:54.924 --> 27:58.219
WE'LL JUST HAVE TO FORGET
ABOUT IT, I GUESS.

28:11.483 --> 28:12.776
MRS. NORDSTROM.

28:17.489 --> 28:18.990
MRS. NORDSTROM,

28:19.157 --> 28:21.493
I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET
MY WIFE CAROLINE.

28:21.659 --> 28:22.702
HOW DO YOU DO?

28:22.869 --> 28:24.329
MRS. NORDSTROM,
AND THAT'S OLGA.

28:24.496 --> 28:25.663
Olga: HELLO.

28:25.830 --> 28:29.125
YOU ARE VERY KIND. COULD
I TALK TO YOU A LITTLE?

28:29.292 --> 28:31.002
CERTAINLY.

28:31.169 --> 28:34.964
OLGA, WHY DON'T YOU COME BACK TO THE
HOUSE WITH ME AND SAY HELLO TO LAURA?

28:35.131 --> 28:37.133
YES, MA'AM.

28:42.055 --> 28:45.683
MR. INGALLS, MY SON
IS NOT LIKE YOU THINK.

28:45.850 --> 28:47.644
HE LOVES OLGA VERY MUCH.

28:47.811 --> 28:50.730
THEY WERE ALWAYS
VERY CLOSE.

28:50.897 --> 28:53.900
ONLY SINCE THE DEATH
OF OLGA'S MOTHER,

28:54.067 --> 28:55.860
HE ONLY WANTED
TO PROTECT OLGA.

28:56.027 --> 28:59.030
HE EVEN DIDN'T WANT HER
TO GO TO SCHOOL.

28:59.197 --> 29:00.740
YOUR SON ISN'T
THE EASIEST MAN

29:00.907 --> 29:02.367
IN THE WORLD TO TALK TO, MRS.
NORDSTROM,

29:02.534 --> 29:04.119
BUT I GUESS THAT DOES
EXPLAIN SOME OF IT.

29:04.285 --> 29:09.082
HE WOULD LIKE TO BUILD A WALL AROUND
OLGA, THAT SHE CANNOT BE HURT,

29:09.249 --> 29:16.172
BUT THAT WOULD BE WRONG BECAUSE SHE
WOULD HAVE NO ONE WHEN WE ARE GONE.

29:16.339 --> 29:17.799
DOES HE KNOW
YOU'RE HERE?

29:17.966 --> 29:20.301
NO. I WILL
TELL HIM LATER.

29:27.934 --> 29:30.854
YOU WILL MAKE
A SHOE FOR OLGA?

29:34.065 --> 29:35.650
I'LL TRY.

29:57.755 --> 29:59.048
HOW DOES THAT FEEL?

29:59.215 --> 30:00.884
MAYBE A LITTLE MORE.

30:01.050 --> 30:02.677
ALL RIGHT.

30:15.064 --> 30:16.649
THEN WE GOT
THE RIGHT HEIGHT.

30:16.816 --> 30:18.902
ALL WE HAVE TO DO
NOW IS BUILD IT.

30:54.062 --> 30:55.522

LOOK OUT! LOOK OUT!

45:00.157 --> 45:01.450
Girl: UH-OH.

45:11.377 --> 45:13.587
Laura: HURRY UP, OLGA.
GET SOMEBODY!

45:15.589 --> 45:17.091
HURRY!

45:35.859 --> 45:38.404
Olga: DID YOU
SEE ME RUN, PAPA?

45:45.994 --> 45:47.746
I SAW YOU.

45:51.291 --> 45:53.419
WATCH ME PLAY, PAPA.

45:58.799 --> 46:00.592
WATCH ME PLAY.

46:02.010 --> 46:03.262
[LAUGHTER]

46:09.810 --> 46:11.103

46:11.270 --> 46:12.771
[GIRLS SHOUTING HAPPILY]

46:14.148 --> 46:16.608
Girl: BE CAREFUL!

46:23.240 --> 46:24.408
Girl: YOU'RE IT.

46:24.575 --> 46:27.411
Second girl: LOOK OUT.
SHE'S GOING TO GET YOU.

46:27.578 --> 46:28.871
Third girl:
HURRY! HURRY!

46:29.037 --> 46:30.289
[LAUGHTER]

46:33.584 --> 46:34.835
Olga: WHO'S IT?

46:48.265 --> 46:50.100
THAT'S THE BEST PARTY IN
THE WHOLE WORLD, MA'AM.

46:50.267 --> 46:51.643
I THANK YOU
FOR ASKING ME.

46:51.810 --> 46:54.730
THANK YOU, CHRISTY. YOU KNOW
YOU'RE WELCOME ANYTIME.

46:54.897 --> 46:57.274
ARE YOU SURE NONE OF YOU GIRLS
NEED A RIDE HOME?

46:57.441 --> 46:59.693
NO, SIR, THANK YOU.
WE'RE JUST FINE.

46:59.860 --> 47:01.278
WELL, I'M NOT JUST FINE.

47:01.445 --> 47:03.030
THAT POND'S DANGEROUS,
MR. INGALLS.

47:03.197 --> 47:04.781
GOT A CRAB IN IT
THAT BIG.

47:04.948 --> 47:07.201
COME CLOSE TO GETTING
MY WHOLE TOE BIT OFF.

47:10.287 --> 47:11.955
THANK YOU.

47:12.122 --> 47:14.124
GOOD-BYE, NELLIE.

47:14.291 --> 47:16.710
BYE, NELLIE!

47:20.797 --> 47:25.052
NOW, I WONDER WHERE NELLIE GOT THE
IDEA THAT CRAB COULD BITE HER TOE OFF.

47:25.219 --> 47:27.304
I THINK IT WOULD BE
A GOOD IDEA

47:27.471 --> 47:29.515
IF WE WALK HOME
A WAYS WITH OUR GUESTS.

47:29.681 --> 47:31.642
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU
DO THAT?

47:31.808 --> 47:32.893
BYE, GIRLS.

47:33.060 --> 47:33.852
BYE.

47:34.019 --> 47:36.063
Second girl:
BYE. THANK YOU.

47:40.526 --> 47:43.237
CAN I WALK WITH THEM, PA? CAN I?

47:55.290 --> 47:57.251
MY MOTHER IS RIGHT.

47:57.417 --> 48:00.420
SHE HAS A FOOL
FOR A SON.

48:03.549 --> 48:05.634
SHE DID HAVE.
