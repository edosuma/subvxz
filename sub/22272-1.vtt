00:07.475 --> 00:10.909
               ¶¶

00:17.551 --> 00:19.885
             (Kyle)
    My name is Kyle Keeley.

00:19.887 --> 00:22.888
    If you're wondering why
  my brothers are chasing me,

00:22.890 --> 00:26.125
        or why I'd steal
     from Twinkie the dog,

00:26.127 --> 00:28.360
  it's all because of one man,

00:28.362 --> 00:30.863
      Luigi L. Lemoncello.

00:36.237 --> 00:37.936
Where is Kyle?
I sent him to buy

00:37.938 --> 00:39.271
a new crescent wrench
an hour ago.

00:39.273 --> 00:42.241
     He's always playing
     those games, he's obsessed.

00:42.243 --> 00:44.410
             (Kyle)
  Some kids play video games.

00:44.412 --> 00:48.080
      We play Lemoncello's
        Scavenger Hunt.

00:48.082 --> 00:50.549
        It's just one of
    his many popular games.

00:50.551 --> 00:56.155
   But rumor has it, his next
  project is the biggest yet.

00:56.157 --> 00:57.923
No, no, no!
The dog!

00:57.925 --> 01:00.359
              Aah!

01:01.562 --> 01:03.262
    Here's the wrench, Dad!

01:07.968 --> 01:08.634
        Whoa!
                  Whoa!

01:08.636 --> 01:10.102
             (Dad)
     Kyle! Come back here!

01:10.104 --> 01:15.007
             (Kyle)
 Mr. Lemoncello is <i> the</i> greatest
    game maker of all time.

01:15.009 --> 01:16.108
       He's also my hero.

01:16.110 --> 01:18.377
    Okay, back to the game.

01:18.379 --> 01:19.211
         My final task.

01:19.213 --> 01:22.581
    Find two coins from 1982
    that add up to 30 cents

01:22.583 --> 01:24.116
   and one can't be a nickel.

01:24.118 --> 01:27.419
       But the other coin
        can be a nickel.

01:27.421 --> 01:28.954
  So, a quarter and a nickel.

01:28.956 --> 01:30.189
          I know where
         to find them.

01:30.191 --> 01:32.357
   ¶ Yeah, you gotta do it ¶

01:32.359 --> 01:34.526
     ¶ I said do it, yeah ¶

01:34.528 --> 01:37.329
    ¶ You've got to do it ¶

01:37.331 --> 01:38.464
        ¶ Do it again ¶

01:38.466 --> 01:42.401
    ¶ You gotta do it again
          and again ¶

01:42.403 --> 01:44.536
          Sorry, boys,
        you're too late.

01:44.538 --> 01:46.271
                 What! No, how?!

01:46.273 --> 01:47.473
Twinkie was right on you.

01:47.475 --> 01:49.408
         It ain't over
        till it's over.

01:49.410 --> 01:53.312
          It is over.

01:54.515 --> 01:56.348
      (school bell rings)

01:56.350 --> 01:57.216
          (Kyle sighs)

01:57.218 --> 01:58.217
             (Kyle)
         Life's funny.

01:58.219 --> 02:01.487
  Once second you strike out,
           game over.

02:01.489 --> 02:03.522
  But then the next second...

02:03.524 --> 02:06.058
     you get a bonus round.

02:17.638 --> 02:19.238
         (class laughs)

02:19.240 --> 02:20.572
           Greetings.

02:20.574 --> 02:22.274
        I am Mrs. Tobin,

02:22.276 --> 02:25.377
          former head
    of the Old Town Library

02:25.379 --> 02:28.514
          which closed
      12 years ago today.

02:28.516 --> 02:33.051
      I'm here to announce
     the opening of a new,

02:33.053 --> 02:35.187
   state-of-the-art library,

02:35.189 --> 02:40.592
 which will stand where the old
   Gold Leaf Bank once stood,

02:40.594 --> 02:44.396
    thanks to your very own
          world-famous

02:44.398 --> 02:47.199
      Luigi L. Lemoncello.

02:47.201 --> 02:51.236
             (Kyle)
     That's right, my idol,
  the greatest game maker ever

02:51.238 --> 02:55.707
had secretly built a crazy cool
  new library in my hometown.

02:55.709 --> 02:59.077
  He even found a way to keep
       the old librarian,

02:59.079 --> 03:01.513
       Mrs. Tobin, alive,
      and it gets better.

03:01.515 --> 03:05.717
  Now, the twelve 12-year-olds
           who write

03:05.719 --> 03:10.656
  the most imaginative essays
        will get to play

03:10.658 --> 03:15.394
          Escape From
   Mr. Lemoncello's Library.

03:15.396 --> 03:17.396
 The winners will be announced

03:17.398 --> 03:21.767
  at Mr. Lemoncello's birthday
    gala in two days' time.

03:21.769 --> 03:23.468
            Toodles.

03:23.470 --> 03:24.536
             (Kyle)
        In that moment,

03:24.538 --> 03:27.172
     I knew my destiny was
       to play that game.

03:27.174 --> 03:30.709
      So I'd have to write
   the best essay of my life,

03:30.711 --> 03:33.445
      'cause everyone else
         would be, too.

03:33.447 --> 03:36.815
      Like Sierra Russell,
     who's read more books

03:36.817 --> 03:39.651
   than everyone else I know
           combined.

03:39.653 --> 03:40.752
     (school bell ringing)

03:40.754 --> 03:42.421
     And Miguel Fernandez,
          the only kid

03:42.423 --> 03:45.624
 who actually does library duty
            for fun.

03:45.626 --> 03:49.161
          Haley Daley,
the most popular girl in school.

03:49.163 --> 03:53.732
A thousands friends, yet somehow
     alone in every photo.

03:54.268 --> 03:56.101
         Uh!
             (Kyle)
       Andrew Peckleman.

03:56.103 --> 04:00.072
      Nice guy, but always
       getting picked on.

04:00.641 --> 04:01.540
     Hey, I'm already out.

04:01.542 --> 04:03.375
           Way to use your head,
           Peckleman.

04:03.377 --> 04:06.845
             (Kyle)
         Which bring me
    to Charles Chiltington.

04:06.847 --> 04:10.582
    Bully, lover of khakis,
      gifted at berating.

04:10.584 --> 04:12.718
                  I eat losers
                  for breakfast.

04:12.720 --> 04:15.354
             (Kyle)
    Unfortunate for us all.

04:15.356 --> 04:16.355
(grunts)

04:16.357 --> 04:17.356
           (laughing)

04:17.358 --> 04:20.259
             (Kyle)
     Finally, Akimi Hughes.

04:20.261 --> 04:20.858
                      Hey, Kyle.

04:20.861 --> 04:25.397
   Mathlete, class treasurer,
      and my best friend.

04:25.833 --> 04:28.667
      Just putting the finishing
      touches on my essay.

04:28.669 --> 04:30.469
                 How'd yours go?

04:31.405 --> 04:32.604
             (Kyle)
        Right, my essay.

04:32.606 --> 04:35.841
   Truth is, I just couldn't
        find the words,

04:35.843 --> 04:39.611
            so I let
    my imagination run wild.

04:39.613 --> 04:41.747
 I put all of my favorite ideas
           in there.

04:41.749 --> 04:46.118
  I even unleashed my biggest
   creation, the Scaradactyl.

04:46.120 --> 04:49.888
I hope it's enough to get me in,
'cause once I'm in that library,

04:49.890 --> 04:53.458
    there is no stopping me
       from getting out.

04:53.460 --> 04:56.695
               ¶¶

05:11.812 --> 05:15.414
       (music continues)

05:52.686 --> 05:56.455
             (man)
     Ladies and gentlemen!
        Boys and girls!

05:56.457 --> 05:59.257
   (trumpet fanfare playing)

05:59.259 --> 06:02.194
        Your attention,
            please!

06:02.196 --> 06:05.263
         Introducing...

06:05.265 --> 06:07.532
      the one, the only...

06:07.534 --> 06:10.702
      Luigi L. Lemoncello!
           (chuckles)

06:10.704 --> 06:13.205
    (cheering and applause)

06:13.674 --> 06:15.640
        (Luigi laughing)

06:15.642 --> 06:17.542
           (laughing)

06:18.412 --> 06:19.578
        Oh, what, what!

06:19.580 --> 06:21.380
           Okay, now,
  let's get down to business.

06:21.382 --> 06:26.551
    Oh, steady as she goes.
    Steady, whoa-whoa-whoa.

06:26.553 --> 06:28.920
       Ooh, ow, whoo-hoo.

06:28.922 --> 06:31.256
 This is harder than it looks!

06:31.258 --> 06:34.292
            Oh, no!

06:40.734 --> 06:43.435
       (crowd screaming)

06:43.437 --> 06:44.970
             Whoa!

06:45.773 --> 06:49.474
    (cheering and applause)

06:49.476 --> 06:51.343
           (laughing)

06:53.347 --> 06:55.647
  First rule of game-making--

06:55.649 --> 06:59.351
           always be
        one step ahead.

06:59.353 --> 07:02.854
    (cheering and applause)

07:07.795 --> 07:11.663
And now to announce the players

07:11.665 --> 07:15.367
      of the greatest game
          of all time.

07:15.369 --> 07:21.706
     Of escape and puzzles
    and a robbery to unwind.

07:21.708 --> 07:27.879
In a hundred-acre library where
    the books come to life,

07:27.881 --> 07:29.781
         12 will enter,

07:29.783 --> 07:33.318
     but only one will win
           the night.

07:33.320 --> 07:39.057
    When you hear your name,
   please, join me on stage.

07:40.294 --> 07:41.793
       Miguel Fernandez!

07:41.795 --> 07:43.895
    (cheering and applause)
Mommy, I did it!

07:43.897 --> 07:46.498
       Andrew Peckleman!

07:46.500 --> 07:48.366
         Yeah!

07:48.368 --> 07:50.769
        Bridgette Wadge!

07:50.771 --> 07:52.971
          Sean Keegan!

07:54.007 --> 07:56.308
        Sierra Russell!

07:56.310 --> 07:57.442
      (gasps)

07:57.444 --> 08:00.879
     Yasmeen Smith-Snyder!

08:01.482 --> 08:03.448
         Kayla Corson!

08:03.450 --> 08:06.818
          Haley Daley!
      No way.

08:07.754 --> 08:09.788
         Akimi Hughes!

08:09.790 --> 08:11.056
          Oh, yes!

08:11.058 --> 08:13.692
         Rose Vermette!

08:13.694 --> 08:15.327
      Charles Chiltington!

08:15.329 --> 08:17.662
           (whispers)
             Yeah!

08:17.664 --> 08:21.566
    And our final winner...

08:21.568 --> 08:23.702
          Kyle Keeley!

08:24.404 --> 08:25.604
            No way!

08:26.440 --> 08:28.607
           Yes, yes!

08:28.609 --> 08:30.775
Makes us proud,
troublemaker.

08:30.777 --> 08:32.611
          Thanks, Dad.

08:35.381 --> 08:41.453
   Now smile for the cameras
       and wave good-bye!

08:42.489 --> 08:45.891
       (excited chatter)

08:49.096 --> 08:50.762
           Whoo-hoo!

08:50.764 --> 08:53.598
    Ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum,
        ba-dum, ba-dum.

08:53.600 --> 08:55.634
           (laughing)

08:55.636 --> 08:57.869
         Whoo-hoo-hoo!

09:07.681 --> 09:11.016
Welcome to my library.

09:11.018 --> 09:14.586
It is a hodgepodge
of many things,

09:14.588 --> 09:15.921
much like me.

09:15.923 --> 09:19.157
       Be warned,
       escaping from the library

09:19.159 --> 09:20.759
  is not for the faint of heart.

09:20.761 --> 09:23.862
       It will test every
      fiber of your being,

09:23.864 --> 09:26.998
               every ounce
               of your strength.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.468
                Every shred
                of your courage!

09:30.470 --> 09:31.436
           (all gasp)

09:31.438 --> 09:34.406
    This is your last chance
   to leave before we begin.

09:34.408 --> 09:39.044
   Unless you're absolutely sure
   you're up to the task...

09:39.046 --> 09:40.145
                            Go!

09:40.147 --> 09:40.845
           (all gasp)

09:40.847 --> 09:45.951
Uh, I forgot, I have...
soccer practice tonight.

09:45.953 --> 09:48.820
            Yeah, me too.

09:49.156 --> 09:53.124
Really?
                Well, ten of you
                still left?

09:53.126 --> 09:57.429
        I guess Mr. Lemoncello's
        losing his edge.

09:57.431 --> 10:02.567
     Allow me to introduce
 Dr. Zinchenko, Head Librarian.

10:02.569 --> 10:04.202
        She's a genius.

10:04.204 --> 10:05.537
            Genius?
                      Thank you.

10:05.539 --> 10:09.774
         These...
         are your library cards.

10:09.776 --> 10:10.709
Wow.
             Cool.

10:10.711 --> 10:15.480
    Each has a help assistance
    mechanism or a "HAM" button.

10:15.482 --> 10:18.183
        Before you press it,
        be aware that if you do,

10:18.185 --> 10:19.451
                  you will be...

10:19.453 --> 10:21.052
Hey, that's me!

10:21.054 --> 10:23.588
That's my face on there!

10:24.825 --> 10:26.491
              Ahh!

10:28.462 --> 10:29.194
             ...out of the game!

10:29.196 --> 10:31.663
         Poor girl,
         she should've listened.

10:31.665 --> 10:34.132
             And followed
             my number-one rule.

10:34.134 --> 10:36.501
        Be gentle to each other.

10:36.503 --> 10:39.004
      And to the library.

10:39.006 --> 10:39.771
                         Mm-hmm.

10:39.773 --> 10:43.908
           Oh, well, she should
           land in three, two...

10:43.910 --> 10:44.743
              No!

10:44.745 --> 10:46.144
         (crowd gasps)

10:50.651 --> 10:53.718
            (Kayla)
        That's not fair.
  How was I supposed to know?

10:53.720 --> 10:56.521
    I can't believe I'm out.
         Let's go home.

10:56.523 --> 11:00.492
       Now, as you solve
    puzzles in the library,

11:00.494 --> 11:03.728
you will gain access
to the clues.

11:03.730 --> 11:05.163
        These clues will
      eventually help you

11:05.165 --> 11:07.065
to answer the big question.

11:07.067 --> 11:10.802
       How to escape from
   Mr. Lemoncello's Library.

11:10.804 --> 11:14.539
Do not attempt to use
the fire exits as shortcuts.

11:14.541 --> 11:19.778
Also, please be aware some areas
 are still under construction.

11:19.780 --> 11:23.815
     So do not go where anything
     is marked off-limits.

11:23.817 --> 11:25.283
                 It could be
                 very dangerous.

11:25.285 --> 11:27.018
           But don't worry,
           we'll be watching you

11:27.020 --> 11:28.953
           from the control room
           at all times.

11:28.955 --> 11:31.256
  Whomever escapes first will
        become the face

11:31.258 --> 11:35.126
        every child sees
   on all things Lemoncello--

11:35.128 --> 11:38.296
  books, games, playing cards.

11:38.298 --> 11:39.130
          You name it.

11:39.132 --> 11:43.001
  After all, everything I do,
         I do for you.

11:43.003 --> 11:46.204
        (all chuckling)
Now behold.

11:46.206 --> 11:48.606
        The Golden Key.

11:48.608 --> 11:49.674
(all gasping)

11:49.676 --> 11:50.875
     It contains more power

11:50.877 --> 11:53.845
        than a bazillion
    lightning bugs combined.

11:53.847 --> 11:56.581
It controls every book,
every relic,

11:56.583 --> 11:58.917
every precious item
in my library.

11:58.919 --> 12:02.120
      And only two exist.

12:02.122 --> 12:05.190
          This one...

12:05.192 --> 12:06.958
           and mine.

12:06.960 --> 12:09.260
(boy)
Wow.

12:11.164 --> 12:12.664
                      Excuse me.

12:13.834 --> 12:17.769
      Just one more flight
           of stairs.

12:17.771 --> 12:20.805
          (squeaking)

12:22.109 --> 12:23.108
           Whoopsie.

12:23.110 --> 12:23.942
               Don't mind those.

12:23.944 --> 12:26.177
 They have a mind of their own.

12:26.179 --> 12:27.979
         (all laughing)

12:29.716 --> 12:30.615
Whoa.

12:30.617 --> 12:32.083
Did you see that?

12:36.223 --> 12:37.021
               Sweet.

12:37.023 --> 12:39.190
This is it.
Oh, this is awesome.

12:39.192 --> 12:44.662
    Behind these doors lies my
    most precious invention yet.

12:44.664 --> 12:49.901
  What may appear to be a normal
  library is anything but.

12:49.903 --> 12:53.204
  You don't just read the books.

12:53.206 --> 12:54.105
                  You live them!

12:54.107 --> 12:57.275
   Here you will face
   the challenges you encounter,

12:57.277 --> 13:01.379
              solve the riddles,
              win the clues.

13:01.381 --> 13:04.716
                Then you too can
                shoo, shoo, shoo

13:04.718 --> 13:06.885
    just like the loblolly, too.

13:06.887 --> 13:07.752
        (all chuckling)

13:07.754 --> 13:09.954
      What's he mean?
      What does he mean by that?

13:09.956 --> 13:12.257
                        Come on.
Here we go.

13:15.028 --> 13:17.762
       (excited chatter)
             (girl)
            No way.

13:17.764 --> 13:18.963
         Look at this.

13:18.965 --> 13:21.332
Whoa.

13:24.337 --> 13:27.238
Look at that.
That is awesome.

13:27.240 --> 13:31.042
  (excited chatter continues)

13:32.746 --> 13:34.379
             Look!

13:39.252 --> 13:41.386
This place is awesome.

13:44.925 --> 13:45.957
                     So awesome.

13:45.959 --> 13:47.826
Look at that.
Look upstairs.

13:47.828 --> 13:51.296
   Now! Let the games begin.

13:51.298 --> 13:55.266
       You have six hours
           to escape.

13:55.268 --> 13:56.701
           Good luck.

13:56.703 --> 13:58.169
         (all gasping)

13:59.506 --> 14:01.539
                Look over there.
            No way.

14:01.541 --> 14:02.974
Look at all the books.

14:02.976 --> 14:04.075
   Check out the inscription.

14:04.077 --> 14:06.077
       Do you think this
      is our first puzzle?

14:06.079 --> 14:08.947
No, it's probably
just some stupid--

14:08.949 --> 14:12.417
   Behold, your first puzzle.

14:12.986 --> 14:18.156
    To get your escape clue,
  you must decipher this code.

14:18.158 --> 14:21.526
  You have two minutes, begin.

14:21.528 --> 14:23.194
Two minutes?
             Okay.

14:23.196 --> 14:24.195
Okay, um...

14:24.197 --> 14:25.496
  Think it's another language?

14:25.498 --> 14:26.364
I don't think so.

14:26.366 --> 14:29.267
          Look, quotation marks.
          Maybe it's a quote.

14:29.269 --> 14:30.435
        Out of the way.

14:30.437 --> 14:33.204
       I'll handle this.
                     Okay, um...

14:33.206 --> 14:35.006
         assuming it is a quote,
         whoever said it

14:35.008 --> 14:37.575
          has a name that's five
          letters, one letter,

14:37.577 --> 14:39.010
                    ten letters.
              So?

14:39.012 --> 14:42.914
     So... we kinda happen
      to be in the library

14:42.916 --> 14:45.116
        of a guy who has
       a middle initial.

14:45.118 --> 14:46.384
      Luigi L. Lemoncello

14:46.386 --> 14:49.087
        is five letters,
    one letter, ten letters.

14:49.089 --> 14:50.121
                           Nice.
Good work, Kyle.

14:50.123 --> 14:52.857
   We can match these characters
   to the letters as a guide.

14:52.859 --> 14:53.391
       Good idea.

14:53.393 --> 14:54.525
Exactly what
I was about to say.

14:54.527 --> 14:57.629
(Andrew)
Funny, if semicolons all mean L,

14:57.631 --> 15:00.598
I always type semicolons
on my phone

15:00.600 --> 15:01.599
when I mean to type L.

15:01.601 --> 15:04.636
             Me too.
             It drives me crazy.

15:04.638 --> 15:05.436
           That's it.

15:05.438 --> 15:08.373
     Each character is one
      keyboard letter off.

15:08.375 --> 15:11.442
       Semicolon means L
    and I means U and so on.

15:11.444 --> 15:15.113
       It's modern typos
   on an ancient manuscript.

15:15.115 --> 15:18.249
  A hodgepodge of old and new.

15:19.352 --> 15:23.021
      Knowledge not shared
        remains unknown.

15:23.023 --> 15:24.489
      Luigi L. Lemoncello.

15:24.491 --> 15:26.391
         (bell dinging)
              Yes!

15:26.393 --> 15:28.192
     Well done.

15:28.194 --> 15:31.062
        Heed this advice
     if you hope to escape.

15:31.064 --> 15:33.298
That's our escape clue?
Lame.

15:33.300 --> 15:36.567
        That's just some
        friendly advice.

15:36.569 --> 15:40.071
       This is your clue.

15:41.942 --> 15:43.374
         (all gasping)

15:43.376 --> 15:44.542
Wow.

15:44.544 --> 15:47.145
           (sighing)

15:47.147 --> 15:48.680
                 Huh.

15:51.151 --> 15:51.549
             Here.

15:51.551 --> 15:56.154
       "Dandy Bandits Rob
       Alexandriaville's
        Gold Leaf Bank."

15:56.156 --> 15:57.555
        Hmm.
        "The Dandy Bandits stole

15:57.557 --> 15:58.589
     $1 and a half million
          last night."

15:58.591 --> 16:02.393
  (Akimi and newsman reading)
  "Employees of the Gold Leave
  Bank were shocked this morning

16:02.395 --> 16:04.195
             when they arrived
             to an empty vault."

16:04.197 --> 16:05.964
            Chief Young had this
            to say to reporters.

16:05.966 --> 16:09.133
     Well, we know exactly
  what the Dandy Bandit stole.

16:09.135 --> 16:11.436
  How they got into the vault
       remains a mystery.

16:11.438 --> 16:14.505
A full investigation's underway.

16:15.976 --> 16:17.408
Whoa, check it out.

16:17.410 --> 16:20.511
The bold letters
spell out "The Way."

16:20.513 --> 16:23.514
                   Hey, is that
                   the bathroom?

16:23.516 --> 16:24.649
                 Too much punch.

16:24.651 --> 16:27.685
Uh-huh,
yes, I think it is.

16:27.687 --> 16:29.620
Right through here, friend.

16:32.292 --> 16:33.257
          Uh-oh, uh...

16:33.259 --> 16:36.227
 (all shouting, alarm sounding)

16:36.229 --> 16:38.463
(girl)
Whoa!

16:40.033 --> 16:41.699
Oops, that was a fire exit.

16:41.701 --> 16:44.435
Guess I forgot to share
the knowledge.

16:44.437 --> 16:46.738
          Why would you do that?

16:46.740 --> 16:47.638
What a weasel.

16:47.640 --> 16:50.641
You know, maybe we should
form a team.

16:50.643 --> 16:53.711
Since knowledge
would actually be shared.

16:53.713 --> 16:54.679
You in?

16:54.681 --> 16:58.016
                     Definitely.
Sweet.

17:03.456 --> 17:05.589
             (all)
             Whoa!

17:14.567 --> 17:17.234
Wow, this must be
that old bank vault

17:17.237 --> 17:20.070
they mentioned
in that article.

17:20.373 --> 17:22.507
                            Ahh!
Out of my way, Pickle.

17:22.509 --> 17:23.741
Now, where...
        (wind whistling)

17:23.742 --> 17:25.410
         There might be
        a clue in there.

17:25.412 --> 17:28.311
    Or better yet... money.

17:28.314 --> 17:29.714
          (snickering)

17:32.318 --> 17:34.085
Whoops, dropped my glasses.

17:34.087 --> 17:37.522
        I can't find them 'cause
        I'm not wearing them.

17:37.524 --> 17:40.191
         Man, catch-22.

17:43.496 --> 17:45.630
Thanks, Kyle.

17:47.801 --> 17:49.434
       Well, that thing's
          not budging.

17:49.436 --> 17:51.169
Good going, Pickle.
          (Mrs. Tobin)
        Boys and girls,

17:51.171 --> 17:53.371
    please meet me in front
     of the horror section

17:53.373 --> 17:55.640
for some important information.

17:55.642 --> 17:59.510
       Think of this room
       as your safe zone.

17:59.512 --> 18:01.245
                    A safe zone?
                    From what?

18:01.247 --> 18:04.582
    From all the challenges
          you'll face.

18:04.584 --> 18:05.416
                   Right, those.

18:05.418 --> 18:09.353
  Now, remember, you may only
    enter each section once

18:09.355 --> 18:13.057
       to look for clues
or else you'll be disqualified.

18:13.059 --> 18:15.726
       Ugh, the old lady
        photobombed me.

18:15.728 --> 18:17.795
                    Uh, Haley...
       I beg your pardon.

18:17.797 --> 18:20.098
             You might wanna pay
             attention to this.

18:20.100 --> 18:23.468
      Uh, Sierra, who said
     you could talk to me?

18:23.470 --> 18:24.469
(groaning)

18:24.471 --> 18:25.837
        Uh, yes, Miguel?

18:25.839 --> 18:27.638
                 Please, please,
                 can I go first?

18:27.640 --> 18:31.242
  I've done, like, 3,000 hours
      of community service

18:31.244 --> 18:32.376
     at the school library.

18:32.378 --> 18:35.279
Okay, Miguel, that is
indeed a good reason.

18:35.281 --> 18:41.752
Your challenge is to retrieve
the escape clue if you dare.

18:41.754 --> 18:45.723
        Or should I say
         if you scare.

18:45.725 --> 18:48.126
          Ooh-ooh-ooh!
            (snaps)

18:51.331 --> 18:52.763
                    (quick beep)

18:54.167 --> 18:55.633
That's amazing.

18:55.635 --> 18:57.668
            So cool.

18:57.670 --> 19:01.472
      Horror, here I come.

19:12.418 --> 19:14.619
          (Mrs. Tobin)
       Welcome to horror.

19:14.621 --> 19:19.824
  Remember, somewhere in this
   section is an escape clue.

19:19.826 --> 19:22.260
 Pay attention to every detail.

19:22.262 --> 19:25.763
          It might be
     right in front of you.

19:25.765 --> 19:28.166
  For your first escape clue,

19:28.168 --> 19:31.302
     you will need to find
      a very famous book.

19:31.304 --> 19:36.674
   You will have two minutes
 to find "The Tell-Tale Heart."

19:36.676 --> 19:39.210
Like, Edgar Allan Poe's
"The Tell-Tale Heart?"

19:39.212 --> 19:43.514
             Yes, but be warned.
             You are not alone.

19:43.516 --> 19:44.849
           (laughing)

19:44.851 --> 19:46.684
Uh, pardon me...
                       (gasps)

19:46.686 --> 19:49.554
Uh, do you know if it's
a full moon tonight?

19:49.556 --> 19:50.855
                 Why do you ask?

19:50.857 --> 19:53.191
(growling)

19:54.794 --> 19:57.461
(roars)
              (screaming)

20:02.268 --> 20:03.801
(panting)

20:03.803 --> 20:06.504
(heart pounding quickly)

20:07.307 --> 20:09.774
       (electronic voice)
    <i> Heart rate increasing.</i>

20:09.776 --> 20:13.377
          <i> All systems</i>
     <i> functioning normally.</i>

20:13.379 --> 20:14.579
         Ta-da!

20:14.581 --> 20:16.480
         Looking good.

20:16.916 --> 20:19.917
Ah, wow, the horror section.

20:19.919 --> 20:23.754
How very scary-tastic,
ooh-hoo.

20:23.756 --> 20:25.690
Ooh...

20:25.692 --> 20:27.391
(laughing)

20:28.428 --> 20:32.897
My, my, your blood
is pumping.

20:32.899 --> 20:35.199
(screaming)

20:36.669 --> 20:39.503
The book! There it is!

20:39.505 --> 20:42.206
                      (low moan)

20:42.208 --> 20:43.307
              Ahh!

20:43.309 --> 20:43.841
(snarls)

20:43.843 --> 20:45.610
           (gasping)
              Okay, forget this!

20:45.612 --> 20:47.678
    I just wanna be a librarian!

20:47.680 --> 20:49.614
                I'm out of here.

20:53.987 --> 20:54.685
                    Hmm?

20:54.687 --> 20:56.354
       Poor, Miguel.
Who cares?

20:56.356 --> 20:59.890
He couldn't handle a little
haunted house, boo-hoo.

20:59.892 --> 21:01.826
What a baby.

21:02.829 --> 21:03.861
Boo!
              (panting)

21:03.863 --> 21:05.696
    I can't do this anymore.

21:05.698 --> 21:07.999
            Wait, don't give up!
I'm out of here.

21:08.001 --> 21:08.866
              Ahh!

21:08.868 --> 21:10.701
(Charles chuckling)

21:11.671 --> 21:14.572
Come on, you really
gonna throw a pity party

21:14.574 --> 21:15.339
every time someone leaves?

21:15.341 --> 21:20.978
Yes, it's called being gentle
with each other and the library.

21:20.980 --> 21:22.546
             Remember? Rule one?

21:22.548 --> 21:24.682
Whatever. It's called
being a wuss.

21:24.684 --> 21:28.886
    I hate to burst your bubble,
    but Akimi and I are a team.

21:28.888 --> 21:33.324
    And we're going to beat you,
    fair and square.

21:33.326 --> 21:34.392
Oh, really?

21:34.394 --> 21:36.794
Well, uh, I'm forming
a team too.

21:36.796 --> 21:38.529
Who's in?

21:38.531 --> 21:39.964
                      Obvi.

21:39.966 --> 21:42.266
           Peckleman?
                Well, actually--

21:42.268 --> 21:44.468
Over here, now, Pickle.

21:44.470 --> 21:46.871
(Haley)
Move it!

21:48.474 --> 21:51.709
Don't bother,
she's "soops" weird.

21:51.711 --> 21:54.879
          Actually she's "soops"
          unavailable.

21:54.881 --> 21:56.914
       'Cause she's on our team.

21:56.916 --> 21:58.949
Thanks, guys.
                        Awesome.

21:59.952 --> 22:00.985
           Yeah, say good night.

22:00.987 --> 22:03.287
              You'll never win
              against this team.

22:03.289 --> 22:05.423
Fine, I guess
we have two teams.

22:05.425 --> 22:08.059
The winning team
AKA, huh, my team.

22:08.061 --> 22:09.994
And Kyle's team of losers.

22:09.996 --> 22:11.662
We're gonna crush you.

22:11.664 --> 22:14.298
Now, let's go
in the children's section.

22:14.300 --> 22:16.334
This ought to be a cinch.

22:16.336 --> 22:18.703
Later, losers.

22:18.705 --> 22:20.004
            Whatevs.

22:20.006 --> 22:21.772
(Charles laughing)

22:24.677 --> 22:27.211
         (laughing)
         Oh, yeah.

22:31.184 --> 22:33.517
                Whoa!
          Cool.

22:37.190 --> 22:40.658
(Haley)
What do you call this?

22:41.761 --> 22:46.464
Fantasy, science, classics.

22:46.466 --> 22:48.099
It's so hard to choose.

22:48.101 --> 22:50.501
  Classics, it's my specialty.

22:50.503 --> 22:52.703
Classics, here we come.

22:53.573 --> 22:56.807
             Whoa.
     Whoa!

22:56.809 --> 22:59.410
         Awesome, whoa.

22:59.412 --> 23:00.277
              Wow.
         Whoa.

23:00.279 --> 23:04.115
        There's gotta be
     a million books here.

23:04.117 --> 23:04.882
(crowing)

23:04.884 --> 23:07.351
                Look at the cute
                little geese.

23:07.353 --> 23:08.219
         (music chimes)

23:08.221 --> 23:10.121
Welcome to
the children's section.

23:10.123 --> 23:13.557
To get your next escape clue,
you have four minutes

23:13.559 --> 23:16.260
to put Humpty Dumpty
back together again.

23:16.262 --> 23:17.828
  Are you kidding me?

23:17.830 --> 23:18.662
  Child's play.

23:18.664 --> 23:21.399
       Also, just a word
          to the wise.

23:21.401 --> 23:22.767
  Do not pick up the goslings

23:22.769 --> 23:26.871
    unless you want to deal
  with an angry Mother Goose.

23:27.774 --> 23:29.673
       Angry Mother Goose, what?

23:29.675 --> 23:32.910
(loud honking)

23:32.912 --> 23:34.779
             Okay.

23:34.781 --> 23:37.882
          Easy Mrs. Goose, easy.

23:38.384 --> 23:41.552
                Oh, for the love
                of geese, help!

23:41.554 --> 23:42.253
      (chuckling)

23:42.255 --> 23:45.523
           Okay, now, let's put
           this big egg together

23:45.525 --> 23:48.259
before Keeley's team
gets their next clue.

23:48.261 --> 23:49.660
            Ahh! No!

23:49.662 --> 23:53.330
      Now in order to get
    your first escape clue,

23:53.332 --> 23:58.302
       you must retrieve
      a very famous book.

23:58.304 --> 24:02.206
   You have two minutes, go!

24:03.509 --> 24:07.912
   Okay, we are officially dead.

24:08.548 --> 24:11.382
     Her beak is so sharp!

24:13.286 --> 24:13.684
                        Ugh!

24:13.686 --> 24:16.720
         Gross! Yolk everywhere!

24:16.722 --> 24:17.721
              Ahh!

24:17.723 --> 24:19.757
           Ahh! Whoa!

24:19.759 --> 24:22.226
        (pigs squealing)

24:22.228 --> 24:24.528
       Okay, never mind!

24:25.798 --> 24:27.765
      Ew! What happened to you?!

24:27.767 --> 24:29.433
        (phone beeping)
              Hold that thought.

24:29.435 --> 24:32.369
            I think I might have
            gotten a signal!

24:33.539 --> 24:34.905
              Ugh!

24:35.975 --> 24:39.443
      Okay... I'm so in trouble!

24:39.445 --> 24:41.212
           Hey! Help!

24:41.214 --> 24:41.879
                    Ahh!

24:41.881 --> 24:43.714
   Hi, friend, I'm Charlotte.

24:43.716 --> 24:45.583
        You're safe now.
                    Charlotte?

24:45.585 --> 24:47.585
         From "Charlotte's Web."

24:47.587 --> 24:49.753
           (sighing)

24:49.755 --> 24:51.355
        You're friendly.

24:51.357 --> 24:52.556
                 Hey! It's okay!

24:52.558 --> 24:55.226
             It's Charlotte from
             "Charlotte's Web"!

24:55.228 --> 24:56.627
        Plus, I learned
       a valuable lesson

24:56.629 --> 24:59.530
    about not judging a book
         by its cover.

24:59.532 --> 25:00.598
         (bell dinging)
                       Did it.

25:00.600 --> 25:03.367
      (Andrew)
      It's really comfy in here.

25:03.369 --> 25:03.734
                   Yes!

25:03.736 --> 25:08.305
   Come on, there's gotta be
      a way to crack this.

25:08.307 --> 25:08.939
                          Think.

25:08.941 --> 25:12.443
Look, that image
up in the corner.

25:12.445 --> 25:15.012
     It's the official flag
            of Rome.

25:15.014 --> 25:17.681
  Rome plus "O" equals Romeo.

25:17.683 --> 25:18.282
         Yes!
                        Yes!

25:18.284 --> 25:20.784
            (Akimi)
        Um, okay, that's
         a hand, right?

25:20.786 --> 25:24.021
          Hand minus "H" is and.

25:24.023 --> 25:26.991
   "Romeo and Juliet" written
    by William Shakespeare.

25:26.993 --> 25:29.260
          (Mrs. Tobin)
   Excellent, the escape clue

25:29.262 --> 25:31.395
         is in the book
      "Romeo and Juliet."

25:31.397 --> 25:33.531
 Tippy-top shelf to your right.

25:33.533 --> 25:37.301
All the way up there.

25:37.303 --> 25:42.339
Oh, no, that is really...
Really high.

25:42.341 --> 25:44.441
              Is that a problem?

25:44.443 --> 25:45.976
          Just a bit.

25:45.978 --> 25:47.945
       I have acrophobia.

25:47.947 --> 25:50.915
          You know...
        Fear of heights?

25:50.917 --> 25:53.384
            (Luigi)
     Oh, wow, that is truly

25:53.386 --> 25:56.320
some team-tastic teamwork
over in classics.

25:56.322 --> 26:00.891
So, what are the children
in children's doing?

26:03.729 --> 26:05.529
                  Wait a minute.

26:05.531 --> 26:06.830
               But-- but
               that's not right.

26:06.832 --> 26:11.368
What the Wilbur? Pigs don't
fly in "Charlotte's Web."

26:11.370 --> 26:13.671
         We've a bug in the pig.

26:13.673 --> 26:14.872
A bug in the pig?

26:14.874 --> 26:17.041
        Yup, a pig bug,
        a system glitch.

26:17.043 --> 26:20.945
           (beeping)
     Right! I'll handle it.

26:20.947 --> 26:22.646
          (chuckling)

26:25.651 --> 26:27.718
There, problem solved.

26:27.720 --> 26:30.654
             Respectfully, uh,
             maybe we're pushing

26:30.656 --> 26:32.089
      the system a tad too hard.

26:32.091 --> 26:34.391
              Perhaps we should
              consider stopping.

26:34.393 --> 26:36.093
Let's not get carried way.

26:36.095 --> 26:38.696
It was one tiny pig bug.

26:38.698 --> 26:39.697
    Simple fix.

26:39.699 --> 26:40.864
        (pigs squealing)
    (chuckling)

26:40.866 --> 26:44.668
What if we create a book
staircase and climb it?

26:44.670 --> 26:48.105
      And ruin by stepping
   on their beautiful covers?

26:48.107 --> 26:49.373
        Are you insane?

26:49.375 --> 26:51.909
Unless you have
a better idea.

26:51.911 --> 26:55.879
          Oh, fine,
          but be gentle, please.

26:55.881 --> 26:59.550
          These books
    are priceless classics.

26:59.552 --> 27:01.585
               "Aesop's Fables."

27:01.587 --> 27:03.387
                 Such a classic.

27:04.457 --> 27:07.057
         "Classic Tales
      of Classical Times."

27:07.059 --> 27:09.026
       Even more classic.

27:10.363 --> 27:13.931
              Huh?
  "First Edition Hard Hover"?

27:13.933 --> 27:17.034
     That's not a classic.
      "With a great book,

27:17.036 --> 27:19.370
         "you can reach
     the greatest heights.

27:19.372 --> 27:21.672
     Luigi L. Lemoncello."

27:25.478 --> 27:26.644
Whoa.

27:26.646 --> 27:28.679
Hey, look at the spines.

27:28.681 --> 27:30.781
Lots of these books
are "hard hovers."

27:30.783 --> 27:32.950
                Grab as many
                as you can find.

27:32.952 --> 27:34.685
       Wait, Kyle, just--

27:34.687 --> 27:37.154
               Oh, check me out!

27:37.156 --> 27:39.390
          Whoa! Whoa!

27:39.392 --> 27:42.793
                 Wait! Help! No!

27:44.730 --> 27:46.664
                       Oh, whoa!

27:46.832 --> 27:49.166
Whoa!
What's happening?

27:50.770 --> 27:52.002
              No!

27:52.004 --> 27:54.638
      I'm gonna crash, look out!

28:06.152 --> 28:08.719
       Whoa, whoa, whoa.

28:10.423 --> 28:13.457
           Okay, so I get how
           to move side-to-side,

28:13.459 --> 28:14.692
           but how do I move up?

28:14.694 --> 28:16.427
Let me see if there
are instructions?

28:16.429 --> 28:19.530
Try the opposite,
tilt forward.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.801
                 (Kyle)
                 Oh, okay, easy.

28:23.803 --> 28:25.703
                This is so cool.

28:25.705 --> 28:27.805
           Oh, sweet.

28:27.807 --> 28:29.440
                   Check me out.

28:29.442 --> 28:32.142
                     Whoa.
             Sweet.

28:32.144 --> 28:34.645
      It's here! I got it!

28:38.084 --> 28:40.017
             Whoa!

28:40.019 --> 28:41.618
              No!

28:41.620 --> 28:43.687
That must be
the express version.

28:43.689 --> 28:45.689
          No-no-no-no,
          no-no-no-no!

28:45.691 --> 28:47.858
              Ahh!

28:49.628 --> 28:52.996
           Hold on!
           We're coming, Sierra.

28:52.998 --> 28:53.764
There it is!

28:53.766 --> 28:56.567
Drop the book,
drop the book, Sierra.

28:56.569 --> 28:57.768
         You got this.
                     We got you.

28:57.770 --> 29:01.238
   Here's the stinking book.
   Now get me down from here!

29:01.240 --> 29:02.873
I'm on it.
             Okay.

29:02.875 --> 29:04.074
Don't worry.

29:04.076 --> 29:05.876
It's working!

29:08.714 --> 29:12.649
       Down, down, down!
     down-down-down-down...

29:12.651 --> 29:13.884
                Yes, we made it.

29:13.886 --> 29:15.552
           (panting)

29:16.555 --> 29:19.056
Now time to see
our escape clue.

29:19.058 --> 29:20.924
            Another old article.

29:20.926 --> 29:23.761
               "Dandy Bandit
               Mystery Thickens.

29:23.763 --> 29:27.264
       "In modern memory,
no mystery has so singularly...

29:27.266 --> 29:28.232
           (newsman)
     ...captivated our town

29:28.234 --> 29:30.667
        "as the case of
 the Dandy Bandit's bank heist.

29:30.669 --> 29:33.170
        But now one clue
 has emerged from a local boy."

29:33.172 --> 29:35.272
I was reading in
the library last night

29:35.274 --> 29:36.573
when I heard some noises.

29:36.575 --> 29:38.909
I was so into my book
that I ignored it.

29:38.911 --> 29:40.911
But later when I finished,
I found a wad

29:40.913 --> 29:44.114
of $100 bills on the floor
that said Gold Leaf Bank.

29:44.116 --> 29:46.650
     Are you saying that
     you were so lost in a book,

29:46.652 --> 29:48.952
       you didn't notice the
       Dandy Bandits behind you?

29:48.954 --> 29:51.155
That's exactly
what I'm saying.

29:51.157 --> 29:51.889
              Well, thanks, son.

29:51.891 --> 29:53.290
         Can you state your name
         for the record?

29:53.292 --> 29:55.592
Yes, sir,
Luigi L. Lemoncello.

29:55.594 --> 29:58.762
             (Kyle)
      Whoa, Mr. Lemoncello
       was in the library

29:58.764 --> 30:00.597
       when the bank was robbed.

30:00.599 --> 30:01.298
         That's right.

30:01.300 --> 30:02.766
  They say he could barely read.

30:02.768 --> 30:05.602
   And the librarian,
   Mrs. Tobin, let him stay late

30:05.604 --> 30:08.906
so he could learn and eventually
design all his cool games.

30:08.908 --> 30:10.140
      And check this out.

30:10.142 --> 30:11.975
       The letters spell
         "is the way."

30:11.977 --> 30:17.314
   It's just like our first clue
   except the word "is."

30:17.316 --> 30:21.652
           Huh.
           "The way is the way."

30:21.654 --> 30:25.155
              The way is the way
              to what, I wonder?

30:25.157 --> 30:26.990
           Let's go.

30:29.094 --> 30:31.195
        Our escape must
      have something to do

30:31.197 --> 30:33.730
with the Dandy Bandits,
right?

30:33.732 --> 30:34.965
                    I know.
I mean...

30:34.967 --> 30:37.201
        they've been in
       all of our clues.

30:37.203 --> 30:39.236
          (grumbling)

30:41.173 --> 30:43.207
        Dumb old clues,
       dumb old robbery.

30:43.209 --> 30:45.776
      So, they found an old book
      in a bank vault.

30:45.778 --> 30:47.778
                      Who cares?

30:47.780 --> 30:50.147
Whoa, not sharing clues much?

30:50.149 --> 30:50.981
         Mind your own business.

30:50.983 --> 30:54.151
       You know, I'm surprised
       you're all still in this.

30:54.153 --> 30:55.085
            Amazed more like it.

30:55.087 --> 30:59.189
       And it looks like most
       of your team is, as well.

30:59.191 --> 30:59.990
           Most of--

30:59.992 --> 31:02.860
             Where's Peckleman?!
         Mmm-mmm.

31:04.129 --> 31:05.863
   Um, well, the bad news is

31:05.865 --> 31:08.799
         I must've lost
    my glasses in that web.

31:08.801 --> 31:13.303
      But the good news is
 I found this canteen of water.

31:13.305 --> 31:15.372
Anyone thirsty?

31:16.342 --> 31:18.809
           Ew! Sick.

31:19.812 --> 31:20.844
Can I see your clue?

31:20.846 --> 31:22.045
I didn't get
a chance to earlier.

31:22.047 --> 31:24.815
        Not my problem.
        If you wanted to see it,

31:24.817 --> 31:26.817
            you should've been
            there when I got it.

31:26.819 --> 31:29.653
I was trying to get reception.

31:29.655 --> 31:31.755
       Now let me see it.

31:31.757 --> 31:34.124
              Well, I would,
              but I accidentally

31:34.126 --> 31:36.860
             left it back in the
             children's section.

31:36.862 --> 31:38.729
        What? No, it's--

31:38.731 --> 31:40.764
            (sighs)
        I'll go get it.

31:40.766 --> 31:42.799
(Kyle)
Wait! Haley!

31:42.801 --> 31:44.201
           (beeping)

31:44.203 --> 31:44.902
         (music chimes)

31:44.904 --> 31:47.905
You may not enter
the same room twice.

31:47.907 --> 31:50.007
You are disqualified.

31:50.009 --> 31:53.043
        What? But I didn't know.

31:53.045 --> 31:56.013
Maybe you shouldn't
have been selfieing

31:56.015 --> 31:57.781
when I gave directions.

31:57.783 --> 32:00.350
Yes, I know what selfies are.

32:00.352 --> 32:02.753
           No! Wait!

32:02.755 --> 32:04.888
          (snickering)

32:05.157 --> 32:08.058
         Well, that was
       oddly satisfying.

32:08.060 --> 32:10.694
       (crowd chattering)

32:13.432 --> 32:17.267
           (laughter)

32:17.269 --> 32:19.269
            (buzzer)

32:19.271 --> 32:20.270
         Wow...

32:20.272 --> 32:22.372
Down to our final five.

32:22.374 --> 32:25.042
Although I'm not so sure
about Mr. Chiltington.

32:25.044 --> 32:28.011
He's pretty borderline
in my book at the moment.

32:28.013 --> 32:31.715
           (beeping)
Oh, no, not
another pig bug.

32:31.717 --> 32:33.817
   Wilbur from "Charlotte's Web"

32:33.819 --> 32:36.019
is grazing on a day
no pigs would die.

32:36.021 --> 32:37.220
       Oh, that is so unnatural.

32:37.222 --> 32:41.258
 Maybe it would be better if I
 went in to fix things manually?

32:41.260 --> 32:42.292
Oh, by all means.

32:42.294 --> 32:46.396
You know, perhaps the system
is under a lot of strain.

32:46.398 --> 32:49.933
I'm sorry I was a bit
pigheaded earlier.

32:49.935 --> 32:50.867
           (laughing)

32:50.869 --> 32:52.402
         Sound the zinger alarm.

32:52.404 --> 32:53.103
           (laughing)

32:53.105 --> 32:56.506
        But I should really go.
        This could be quite bad.

32:56.508 --> 32:57.341
             Right.

32:57.343 --> 33:00.811
    Well, you'll excuse my team.

33:00.813 --> 33:02.279
     (grunting)

33:04.984 --> 33:06.316
(Charles muttering)

33:06.318 --> 33:09.086
So, where to now?

33:09.088 --> 33:11.788
Akimi, would you like
to do the honors?

33:11.790 --> 33:15.959
                 Um, I choose...

33:15.961 --> 33:17.094
                fantasy.

33:17.096 --> 33:19.463
    They're going that way,
            come on.

33:19.465 --> 33:21.298
What?
        Shush, Pickle.

33:21.300 --> 33:22.866
 I don't want them to hear us.

33:22.868 --> 33:25.469
What? I'm having trouble
hearing you without my glasses.

33:25.471 --> 33:28.372
       Hearing has nothing to do
       with your glasses.

33:28.374 --> 33:30.240
    Now, we're gonna follow them

33:30.242 --> 33:32.442
             and let them
             do the work for us.

33:32.444 --> 33:34.911
Wait, isn't that cheating?

33:34.913 --> 33:36.480
Our parents are right outside.

33:36.482 --> 33:38.415
        Maybe yours are,
        but mine aren't.

33:38.417 --> 33:40.851
What? Why aren't they here?

33:40.853 --> 33:42.486
      It's none of your--
          They just--

33:42.488 --> 33:45.355
  They had a prior engagement,
             okay?

33:45.357 --> 33:47.257
Oh, sorry, Chilty.

33:47.259 --> 33:48.258
You wanna talk about it?

33:48.260 --> 33:50.360
            No, I don't
            wanna talk about it.

33:50.362 --> 33:52.329
       And don't call me Chilty.

33:52.564 --> 33:53.864
           (beeping)

33:53.866 --> 33:54.364
          (loud thud)

33:54.366 --> 33:57.334
      Let's win this thing
       once and for all.

33:58.804 --> 34:00.404
            (gasps)

34:00.406 --> 34:03.140
Oh, Dr. Zinchenko.

34:03.142 --> 34:04.174
                    How are you?

34:04.176 --> 34:08.344
     We are definitely
     not cheating.

34:08.347 --> 34:12.449
        Just doing some
       mild maintenance.

34:12.451 --> 34:14.885
           Good day.

34:14.887 --> 34:16.453
             Sorry.

34:19.824 --> 34:21.958
                Okay.
      Let's do this.

34:24.463 --> 34:26.496
         Now, come on.

34:29.435 --> 34:31.967
Move it, Pickle.

34:36.909 --> 34:38.442
     Whoa!

34:40.079 --> 34:41.945
             Cool.

34:41.947 --> 34:42.846
Check it out.

34:42.848 --> 34:44.915
       (Sierra)
       Look, more fantasy books.

34:44.917 --> 34:49.119
  The entire first edition of
  all the Charles Dickens books.

34:50.922 --> 34:52.188
Whoa, guys, look.

34:52.190 --> 34:54.391
       Come on, let's go.

34:54.393 --> 34:56.960
                Oh, wait for me!

35:16.248 --> 35:18.281
             (Kyle)
      Hey, guys, check out
          this bridge.

35:18.283 --> 35:21.485
                This is so cool.

35:25.257 --> 35:27.457
Look at this place.

35:27.459 --> 35:29.192
         (music chimes)

35:29.194 --> 35:32.062
 Welcome to the Fantasy Forest.

35:32.064 --> 35:34.030
 To get your next escape clue,

35:34.032 --> 35:38.969
         you must cross
       Lemoncello Bridge.

35:38.971 --> 35:40.270
             There's the clue...

35:40.272 --> 35:42.339
         ... hanging on
       what I'm guessing

35:42.341 --> 35:44.608
     is a giant beanstalk?

35:44.610 --> 35:46.510
Yup, Jack and the Beanstalk.

35:46.512 --> 35:49.513
Originally titled
"The Story of Jack Spriggins

35:49.515 --> 35:52.549
and the Enchanted Bean," 1734.

35:52.551 --> 35:54.417
Thanks, Sierra, I got it.

35:54.419 --> 35:56.920
        (Dr. Zinchenko)
       Not cool, Wilbur.

35:56.922 --> 35:59.689
          Ooh, that is some pig!
          (cackling)

35:59.691 --> 36:03.026
Now go back
to the children's section.

36:04.062 --> 36:05.495
(Sierra)
You just have to cross?

36:05.497 --> 36:07.497
Doesn't seem like
much of a puzzle to me.

36:07.499 --> 36:13.170
   Hold up. Mr. Lemoncello would
   never make it that simple.

36:13.172 --> 36:14.571
Well, well, well!

36:14.573 --> 36:18.508
      So you want to cross
   Lemoncello Bridge, do you?

36:18.510 --> 36:21.077
       How about we play
         a little game?

36:21.079 --> 36:24.281
          If you win,
         you may cross.

36:24.283 --> 36:27.083
   If I win, I introduce you

36:27.085 --> 36:28.952
 to the biggest friend I have,

36:28.954 --> 36:32.122
          the giant--
     and boy, is he grumpy!

36:32.124 --> 36:33.557
       Say hello, giant.

36:33.559 --> 36:37.661
                 (giant)
                 Fee fi foh fum!

36:37.663 --> 36:39.429
        He's not exactly
         the smartest,

36:39.431 --> 36:42.165
     but he makes up for it
         in other ways.

36:42.167 --> 36:45.101
   What? There's
   a giant up there?

36:45.103 --> 36:46.403
          Shh! Pickle!

36:46.405 --> 36:48.271
     But enough about that.

36:48.273 --> 36:52.609
    Behold the troll board.

36:52.611 --> 36:54.411
                    Oh!
    Oh!

36:55.180 --> 36:56.746
            Luigi L. Lemoncello.

36:56.748 --> 37:00.417
        Give me 16 words
     from these 16 letters

37:00.419 --> 37:05.021
         in 60 seconds,
         starting now.

37:05.023 --> 37:06.423
          Lemon.
      Cello.

37:06.425 --> 37:08.058
          (bell dings)

37:08.060 --> 37:09.659
                     Lion.
     Eon.

37:09.661 --> 37:11.094
             Mole.

37:11.096 --> 37:13.196
Leg. Elm.
                     Oil.

37:13.198 --> 37:14.598
One.

37:14.600 --> 37:16.466
     Uh... cell!

37:16.635 --> 37:19.736
       Oh, don't tell me
  that you're already stumped.

37:19.738 --> 37:21.638
That's only ten words.

37:21.640 --> 37:23.240
                         (giant)
                         Yummy.

37:23.242 --> 37:24.140
        Patience, giant.

37:24.142 --> 37:26.476
     Their time will be up
          soon enough.

37:26.478 --> 37:28.678
Okay, I can't stay here.

37:28.680 --> 37:32.349
There's a big, huge,
massive, enormous...

37:32.351 --> 37:34.417
Giant. Why are you
using lots of words

37:34.419 --> 37:37.654
that all mean "giant" when
you could just say "giant"?

37:37.656 --> 37:39.089
                       Uh, mole.
            (buzzer)

37:39.091 --> 37:41.424
            (troll)
     You already said that!
                   Right. Sorry.

37:41.426 --> 37:45.328
     (troll)
     You can't make the word
     "sorry" from those letters.

37:45.330 --> 37:46.696
You're trying to cheat, eh?

37:46.698 --> 37:48.131
           (groaning)
Stop.

37:48.133 --> 37:50.233
          If we move,
     we'll blow our cover.

37:50.235 --> 37:53.603
         We're staying.
         End of story.

37:55.140 --> 37:58.375
             (Kyle)
         Come on, guys,
   we're running out of time.

37:58.377 --> 38:00.310
(Sierra)
Come on.

38:00.312 --> 38:02.178
           (chatter)

38:02.180 --> 38:03.580
                            Hmm.

38:06.251 --> 38:08.485
              Mmm!

38:09.054 --> 38:13.189
       Gross! Those were
         on the ground.

38:14.393 --> 38:16.126
                          Lice.
             Glen.

38:16.128 --> 38:17.060
           That's 12.

38:17.062 --> 38:20.163
     Too bad you only have
        15 seconds left.

38:20.165 --> 38:21.097
           (groaning)

38:21.099 --> 38:23.700
          These are pretty good.
          Kind of like croutons.

38:23.702 --> 38:27.137
That's probably
because they're stale.

38:27.139 --> 38:29.406
        Now, Kyle's team
        is about to lose

38:29.408 --> 38:31.641
           and you're
      ruining the moment.

38:31.643 --> 38:32.609
           (chatter)

38:32.611 --> 38:34.744
           (groaning)
             Think!

38:34.746 --> 38:38.448
         5, 4, 3, 2...

38:38.450 --> 38:41.084
   Go, long, melon, colonel!
          (bell dings)

38:41.086 --> 38:44.254
  Nice teamwork! You may cross
       Lemoncello Bridge.

38:44.256 --> 38:46.389
                 Yes!
          Yes!

38:46.391 --> 38:49.326
           (groaning)
      I don't believe it!

38:49.328 --> 38:50.593
            How did you do that?

38:50.595 --> 38:52.729
               A whole lot
               of spelling bees.

38:52.731 --> 38:54.431
         All right. There's
         the next clue. Come on.

38:54.433 --> 38:56.099
(troll)
Careful out there, kids!

38:56.101 --> 38:58.802
You never know
what you might see!

39:02.174 --> 39:02.739
                      (groaning)

39:02.741 --> 39:06.743
Good fellow, have you seen
any breadcrumbs laid about?

39:06.745 --> 39:09.179
My sister and I
have lost our way.

39:09.181 --> 39:10.413
                           Oops.
    No.

39:10.415 --> 39:10.880
                          Mm-mm.

39:10.882 --> 39:13.016
     It's just a few. Are you
     sure you haven't seen them?

39:13.018 --> 39:14.918
Get out of here,
will ya? Shoo!

39:14.920 --> 39:16.753
                  You know what?
                  That's it.

39:16.755 --> 39:20.924
           I am done waiting for
           these losers to lose.

39:20.926 --> 39:22.659
                       (beeping)

39:27.966 --> 39:30.100
                It's time to win
                this thing.

39:30.102 --> 39:32.902
What? How did you
get that?

39:36.208 --> 39:37.741
Whoa-hoa-hoa-hoa!

39:37.743 --> 39:42.879
               Like taking candy
               from a baby.

39:42.881 --> 39:44.781
             Sorry.

39:46.885 --> 39:48.952
You stole it from Dr. Z?

39:48.954 --> 39:52.055
           I merely borrowed it,

39:52.057 --> 39:55.425
        the same way
        I merely borrowed these.

39:56.962 --> 39:59.462
You had my glasses
this whole time?

39:59.464 --> 40:02.866
           Yes. Now,
      let me concentrate.

40:02.868 --> 40:04.801
This must do something.

40:04.803 --> 40:05.702
     (electronic feedback)

40:05.704 --> 40:09.272
              Oh, bingo, baby.
              Now we're talking.

40:11.476 --> 40:13.209
           (beeping)

40:13.211 --> 40:14.944
        (evil laughter)

40:14.946 --> 40:19.048
          Now, to fix this mess.

40:19.050 --> 40:20.884
            (gasps)

40:20.886 --> 40:22.252
             What?

40:22.254 --> 40:24.788
    Where's the golden key?

40:27.893 --> 40:29.993
           Let's go!

40:34.132 --> 40:37.267
           (beeping)

40:37.269 --> 40:38.301
             Whoa!

40:38.303 --> 40:40.470
           (cracking)
       (gasping)

40:40.472 --> 40:42.038
         What is that?

40:42.040 --> 40:44.174
          (screaming)

40:44.476 --> 40:46.976
          What?
        (giant roaring)

40:46.978 --> 40:48.011
         Oh!

40:48.013 --> 40:50.046
                  You've gotta
                  be kidding me!

40:50.048 --> 40:51.915
           (grunting)

40:55.754 --> 40:57.921
What are you doing, Pickle?

41:01.126 --> 41:04.761
      (electronic buzzing)

41:04.763 --> 41:05.161
            (alarm)

41:05.163 --> 41:08.097
              This is definitely
              not terrific.

41:08.099 --> 41:10.467
      What just happened?

41:10.469 --> 41:12.902
              Oh!
           (beeping)

41:12.904 --> 41:16.139
   Dr. Z, we have a problem.

41:16.141 --> 41:19.008
        (gears whirring)

41:25.517 --> 41:27.050
            (hisses)

41:27.052 --> 41:29.352
Stay close.

41:30.922 --> 41:32.355
           (honking)

41:32.357 --> 41:34.123
                       (howling)

41:35.160 --> 41:37.093
           (growling)

41:38.029 --> 41:40.430
       What is going on?

41:42.167 --> 41:44.000
        (pig squealing)
              Aah!

41:46.204 --> 41:47.403
            Wilbur!

41:47.405 --> 41:51.140
(Frankenstein)
Dr. Z!

41:51.142 --> 41:52.976
           (groaning)

41:52.978 --> 41:57.914
           Oh, my...
         Frankenstein!

41:57.916 --> 41:59.482
          (screaming)

41:59.484 --> 42:01.918
    (whistling and buzzing)

42:01.920 --> 42:04.087
              What gives?
          It's broken.

42:04.089 --> 42:05.822
                The system must
                have overloaded.

42:05.824 --> 42:06.956
                   They'll have
                   to reboot it.

42:06.958 --> 42:09.893
         Time to power
        the system down.

42:09.895 --> 42:12.929
         Come on, baby,
            come on!

42:13.498 --> 42:16.432
  Oh, why isn't this working?

42:17.235 --> 42:19.135
              Oh!
           (gasping)

42:19.137 --> 42:19.669
         The other key!

42:19.671 --> 42:22.872
  The library operating system
       has been hijacked!

42:22.874 --> 42:25.008
         (music chimes)
           Look!

42:25.010 --> 42:26.910
I'm not feeling so well.

42:26.912 --> 42:28.344
(groaning)

42:28.346 --> 42:29.078
    (whimpering)

42:29.080 --> 42:34.517
Chiltington! No!
You're ruining everything!

42:34.519 --> 42:36.953
               ¶¶

42:41.493 --> 42:43.192
           (howling)

42:43.194 --> 42:46.362
(groaning)
                    Aah!

42:46.364 --> 42:49.165
              Aah!
       (groaning)

42:49.167 --> 42:50.633
         (all gasping)

42:51.603 --> 42:53.436
        (witch cackling)

42:53.438 --> 42:55.471
          Whoa!
                Oh!

42:55.473 --> 42:57.173
             (Kyle)
         What is that?

42:57.175 --> 42:59.208
        (witch cackling)

43:00.245 --> 43:02.211
          (whimpering)

43:03.048 --> 43:04.547
     What is that?

43:04.549 --> 43:07.150
           (cackling)

43:07.152 --> 43:08.184
            Go! Now!

43:08.186 --> 43:10.019
          My hand isn't working.

43:10.021 --> 43:11.654
        Neither is mine.

43:16.161 --> 43:17.927
        (witch cackling)

43:19.264 --> 43:21.264
         (all shouting)

43:27.238 --> 43:29.606
       Pickle, over here.
         Get over here.

43:29.608 --> 43:32.175
                Hurry. Get down!

43:33.511 --> 43:36.546
(all screaming)

43:37.415 --> 43:40.683
           (cackling)

43:47.092 --> 43:49.058
          Is that what
         I think it is?

43:49.060 --> 43:50.593
Sure looks like it.

43:50.595 --> 43:51.461
        (witch cackling)

43:51.463 --> 43:54.163
Stay down so she
doesn't see us.

43:54.165 --> 43:56.499
        (witch cackling)

43:58.536 --> 44:00.303
                       Go!

44:00.305 --> 44:03.206
               ¶¶

44:04.242 --> 44:05.308
         Keep running!

44:05.310 --> 44:06.709
           Over here,
     underneath the stairs!

44:06.711 --> 44:10.113
Get down, get down!
Come on, she's coming!

44:13.184 --> 44:15.118
           (moaning)

44:16.488 --> 44:18.521
I can't believe you
did this, Peckleman.

44:18.523 --> 44:20.189
               Me? You did this.
       Me?

44:20.191 --> 44:22.025
I would have sabotaged
the other team just fine

44:22.027 --> 44:27.230
if it wasn't for your
stupid conscience kicking in.

44:27.232 --> 44:28.564
         (both gasping)

44:28.566 --> 44:31.367
    You ate our breadcrumbs!

44:31.369 --> 44:32.969
I was hungry.
I'm sorry.

44:32.971 --> 44:35.138
                 Prepare to meet
                 our wrath.

44:35.140 --> 44:37.173
        (both screaming)

44:37.175 --> 44:38.574
            Come on.
                Get them!

44:38.576 --> 44:40.576
   Hurry up, Pickle! Come on!

44:40.578 --> 44:44.547
       What happened to the main
       hall being the safe zone?

44:45.550 --> 44:49.118
   More like the danger zone.
                           Duck!

44:51.322 --> 44:52.021
Oh, children!

44:52.023 --> 44:55.124
This is definitely
not part of the game!

44:55.126 --> 44:56.726
The library's gone haywire!

44:56.728 --> 44:57.727
(growling)

44:57.729 --> 44:58.761
Run, children, run!

44:58.763 --> 45:01.764
                Save yourselves!
                Get out of here!

45:01.766 --> 45:03.700
              Come on. Let's try
              the exit doors!

45:03.702 --> 45:06.135
             Okay.
                 Go, go, go!

45:06.137 --> 45:08.037
               ¶¶

45:09.307 --> 45:11.340
Hurry, up, Pickle.
                    (whimpering)

45:13.044 --> 45:16.012
Come on. Come on,
down here, down here.

45:17.482 --> 45:19.382
               (hissing)

45:19.384 --> 45:21.217
        (both screaming)

45:21.219 --> 45:22.752
Come on, Pickle!

45:25.790 --> 45:29.792
       All right, Pickle,
     this way. Go, go, go!

45:29.794 --> 45:32.695
        Come on, Hansel.

45:34.365 --> 45:37.366
               Come on, come on.
               Let's go.

45:38.169 --> 45:41.170
            (Gretel)
        Teach you to eat
      my breadcrumbs. Ooh!

45:41.172 --> 45:42.672
       (Dracula hissing)

45:42.674 --> 45:44.273
               ¶¶

45:46.444 --> 45:47.810
           They're jammed!

45:47.812 --> 45:49.579
         Stop! Don't pull those.

45:49.581 --> 45:52.348
We'll lose the game
if we go out that way.

45:52.350 --> 45:54.150
              Watch out, Chilty!

45:54.152 --> 45:56.185
           (shouting)

45:57.355 --> 46:00.723
               Time to say
               <i> auf wiedersehen.</i>

46:01.760 --> 46:05.128
   Don't you dare hurt them!

46:05.130 --> 46:07.163
        (relieved sighs)

46:08.166 --> 46:10.633
         That's my job.

46:10.635 --> 46:12.468
        (all screaming)

46:13.838 --> 46:15.805
       Here! Go in here!

46:15.807 --> 46:17.607
             Go, go, go, go, go!

46:20.712 --> 46:22.812
                      (growling)

46:22.814 --> 46:25.515
        (all whimpering)

46:29.954 --> 46:31.988
I think we've lost 'em.

46:31.990 --> 46:33.756
             Um, where are we?

46:33.758 --> 46:36.459
          No, no, no!
   Not the Imagination Room!

46:36.461 --> 46:38.828
      The room isn't ready
   for human interaction yet.

46:38.830 --> 46:41.564
One thought could
create a disaster!

46:41.566 --> 46:43.800
      I have to help them!
            Oh, my!

46:43.802 --> 46:46.135
        So, what are we
        supposed to do?

46:46.137 --> 46:47.804
      Just wait here until
       somebody finds us

46:47.806 --> 46:50.873
      and hope it's not some
      crazed literary character?

46:50.875 --> 46:51.507
              Shh!

46:51.509 --> 46:53.576
       (werewolf growling
         and sniffing)

46:53.578 --> 46:55.244
        Please, don't be
         the werewolf.

46:55.246 --> 46:57.680
     Don't be the werewolf.
Quiet!

46:57.682 --> 46:59.148
              It's the werewolf.

46:59.150 --> 47:01.250
           I knew it.
Look.

47:01.252 --> 47:03.753
                      (growling)

47:03.755 --> 47:06.255
        There's a light.

47:06.257 --> 47:08.724
           Maybe it's
        another way out.

47:09.961 --> 47:12.161
               ¶¶

47:16.234 --> 47:17.166
                     What is it?

47:17.168 --> 47:21.070
        They're goggles.
   Maybe they're night vision

47:21.072 --> 47:23.606
        so I can see if
     there's another door.

47:23.608 --> 47:24.507
      I'm putting 'em on.

47:24.509 --> 47:26.542
                  Wait, wait,
                  don't do that.

47:26.544 --> 47:29.745
      (electronic sounds)

47:31.616 --> 47:34.217
          What the...

47:34.219 --> 47:35.685
          Where am I?

47:35.687 --> 47:39.555
      I don't think these
   are night vision goggles.

47:39.557 --> 47:41.757
      Whoa! A pterodactyl!

47:41.759 --> 47:44.160
     It kind of looks like
           my Scara--

47:44.162 --> 47:45.595
             Whoa!

47:45.597 --> 47:47.930
          (screaming)

47:55.573 --> 47:57.673
         Help me! Aah!

47:57.675 --> 48:00.142
       Oh! I'm on the top
          of a cliff!

48:01.880 --> 48:03.212
              Aah!

48:03.715 --> 48:05.681
          Oh!
        (computer voice)
      <i> Transfer complete.</i>

48:05.683 --> 48:07.717
                        Come on.
                Let's go!

48:12.557 --> 48:14.156
        Coast is clear.

48:17.762 --> 48:21.631
            Come on.
            Keep your eyes open.

48:23.134 --> 48:26.302
Hey, look, there's our clue
from the Fantasy Forest.

48:26.304 --> 48:28.771
It must have fallen
out of my pocket.

48:29.841 --> 48:32.275
Hey! No! No, give it!

48:40.952 --> 48:44.687
    Thanks. I did not
    expect that.
                      Me either.

48:44.689 --> 48:46.656
     Me neither.
Me neither.

48:46.658 --> 48:48.991
      Let's just move on,
            please.

48:48.993 --> 48:51.861
                "Dandy Bandits
                Mystery Solved!"

48:51.863 --> 48:53.629
"It's taken a month,
but the puzzle

48:53.631 --> 48:55.197
nobody thought solvable
is solved..."

48:55.199 --> 48:56.666
               The bandits
               thought to be led

48:56.668 --> 48:58.601
                 by the infamous
                 Leopold of Lali

48:58.603 --> 49:00.169
            used a secret tunnel
            to access

49:00.171 --> 49:01.837
          the ventilation system
          at the bank.

49:01.839 --> 49:05.041
       The entrance was here,
       hidden behind this grate.

49:05.043 --> 49:08.010
      This explains why we found
      a book in the vault

49:08.012 --> 49:10.146
        and cash in the library.

49:12.083 --> 49:13.683
                      Good idea.

49:19.190 --> 49:21.090
        "In the way is the way."

49:21.092 --> 49:21.691
              Hmm.

49:21.693 --> 49:24.794
              Or is it, "The way
              is the way in"?

49:24.796 --> 49:28.064
               Uhh! This doesn't
               make any sense.

49:28.066 --> 49:29.765
Wait.

49:29.767 --> 49:32.201
You're missing one.

49:36.374 --> 49:39.008
         The answer is
       in this somewhere.

49:39.010 --> 49:41.243
No way!

49:42.680 --> 49:46.349
             (all)
          "The way out
        is the way in."

49:47.318 --> 49:49.719
               Of course!
               We use the tunnel

49:49.721 --> 49:52.822
          the Dandy Bandits used
          to get into the bank

49:52.824 --> 49:54.724
                 to get out
                 of the library.

49:54.726 --> 49:56.659
            And that's what
            Mr. Lemoncello meant

49:56.661 --> 49:58.427
            when he told us
            to "shoo, shoo, shoo

49:58.429 --> 50:00.229
              just like
              the loplolly two."

50:00.231 --> 50:01.864
Wow. Knowledge shared.

50:01.866 --> 50:04.300
I guess that Tobin lady
isn't such a moron.
                    Nice!

50:04.302 --> 50:07.136
So, now we just have to
find the tunnel entrance

50:07.138 --> 50:10.806
somewhere in this massive,
massive library.

50:10.808 --> 50:13.376
           (clacking)
        Hey, do you guys
           hear that?

50:13.378 --> 50:16.812
Shh! Quiet!
They'll find us.

50:16.814 --> 50:21.117
       Wait. I know where
    the tunnel entrance is.

50:21.119 --> 50:22.251
  You do?
                       Yes!

50:22.253 --> 50:24.854
           (clacking)
                Guys, seriously,

50:24.856 --> 50:26.188
         nobody else hears that?

50:26.190 --> 50:26.756
   Shh!
                       Shh!

50:26.758 --> 50:27.923
Quiet, Sierra!
                  Quiet, Sierra!

50:27.925 --> 50:31.394
         I'd recognize
      that grate anywhere.

50:31.396 --> 50:32.695
                   Thanks, Kyle.

50:32.697 --> 50:36.465
          (Peckleman)
That's where I lost my glasses.

50:36.467 --> 50:39.969
        Great!
           Yep, it's a grate.

50:39.971 --> 50:43.105
No, I mean...
Never mind.

50:43.107 --> 50:44.040
Where is it?

50:44.042 --> 50:46.242
            It's in
    the true crime section,

50:46.244 --> 50:47.410
    near the old vault door,

50:47.412 --> 50:51.781
      just a straight shot
       through... there.

50:51.783 --> 50:54.950
     (hissing and growling)

50:55.987 --> 50:57.086
          (squealing)

50:57.088 --> 50:58.888
          Okay, here's the plan.

50:58.890 --> 51:01.357
          Let's split up and try
          to lure them away.

51:01.359 --> 51:02.892
          (whimpering)
        I'm out of here.

51:02.894 --> 51:04.493
Pickle, wait.
I'm coming with you.

51:04.495 --> 51:06.762
              Come on, let's go!

51:06.764 --> 51:08.164
               ¶¶

51:16.808 --> 51:19.809
I told you
I heard something!

51:19.811 --> 51:22.511
               ¶¶

51:22.513 --> 51:24.513
          (screeching)

51:33.124 --> 51:35.024
Keep running!

51:44.168 --> 51:44.900
      Wait a minute.

51:44.902 --> 51:47.103
No more force field
when we go into the books?

51:47.105 --> 51:49.305
        Must be because
    there was a malfunction.

51:49.307 --> 51:51.273
     That's got to be what
   keeps all these characters

51:51.275 --> 51:53.909
    stuck in their section.
  Exactly.

51:53.911 --> 51:56.345
Without it,
they roam free.

51:56.347 --> 51:57.546
Let's hide in that barn
until we're sure

51:57.548 --> 52:00.015
that bird monster can't
get through this door.

52:00.017 --> 52:01.117
     Right.
      Come on, hurry.

52:01.119 --> 52:03.886
    Pickle!
Perfect! We're in
the horror section.

52:03.888 --> 52:06.155
     Cool it, Pickle.
     We just need to wait it out

52:06.157 --> 52:10.025
           until that bird thing
           finds the nest.

52:11.329 --> 52:13.329
           (groaning)

52:15.099 --> 52:17.466
Let's get out of here!

52:17.969 --> 52:21.137
                 (horse bellows)
              Oh!

52:24.342 --> 52:26.142
           (gasping)

52:27.411 --> 52:33.382
Aah! We're trapped!
I also have arachnophobia!

52:33.384 --> 52:34.483
            Wait. Peckleman said

52:34.485 --> 52:36.418
         it's Charlotte
         from "Charlotte's Web."

52:36.420 --> 52:38.420
           Charlotte's
           one of the good guys.

52:38.422 --> 52:40.990
                     We're safe.
      That's right, Kyle,

52:40.992 --> 52:42.525
        but Mother Goose
         found her way

52:42.527 --> 52:44.160
     into the martial arts
            section

52:44.162 --> 52:46.962
        and got her beak
      on some ninja gear.

52:46.964 --> 52:49.365
Boy, is she on fire.

52:52.436 --> 52:54.837
               ¶¶

52:55.072 --> 52:58.974
    Okay, kids, time for you
     to-- Oh! That's sharp.

52:58.976 --> 53:00.009
                I'm out of here.

53:00.011 --> 53:02.111
                    "Escap"?
                 "Escape," Kyle.

53:02.113 --> 53:03.379
              Good grief! Hurry!

53:03.381 --> 53:05.047
           (grunting)

53:07.418 --> 53:09.451
See? My cards never fail.

53:09.453 --> 53:11.453
(Mother Goose honking)

53:13.858 --> 53:16.258
                    Oh, no! Run!

53:16.260 --> 53:18.093
(Charlotte)
Run for your lives!

53:18.095 --> 53:20.863
Back to the library!

53:24.068 --> 53:26.502
       (witch muttering)

53:27.004 --> 53:30.706
         There they are. Keeley,
         over here, quickly!

53:32.877 --> 53:34.777
(witch chuckling)

53:38.115 --> 53:39.381
          Smart thinking, Akimi.

53:39.383 --> 53:41.450
       Dehydration is one of the
       leading causes of death

53:41.452 --> 53:43.986
           when people are in
           emergency situations.

53:43.988 --> 53:44.920
     Great. Thanks, Sierra.

53:44.922 --> 53:47.356
       That makes me feel
         a lot better.

53:47.358 --> 53:49.959
                Have you seen
                the Scaradactyl?
No.

53:49.961 --> 53:52.861
Hopefully, it flew back
into the nature section.

53:52.863 --> 53:55.998
Or maybe it's just
waiting for its chance

53:56.000 --> 53:59.568
to swoop down
and tear us apart.

53:59.570 --> 54:01.870
              Ah!
          (chuckling)

54:01.872 --> 54:03.906
       (witch muttering)

54:03.908 --> 54:07.943
       Uh, Akimi, why are you
       staring at her like that?

54:07.945 --> 54:10.879
      Does anyone remember
         the one thing

54:10.881 --> 54:11.914
     witches are afraid of?

54:11.916 --> 54:15.417
Um, falling houses?
              Yes, that's right.

54:15.419 --> 54:16.552
        In the bestselling book,

54:16.554 --> 54:17.720
                  "The Wonderful
                  Wizard of Oz,"

54:17.722 --> 54:19.855
          written by
          L. Frank Baum in 1900,

54:19.857 --> 54:21.890
              made into a motion
              picture in 1939,

54:21.892 --> 54:24.793
      directed by Victor Fleming
      and starring Judy Garland.

54:24.795 --> 54:26.528
Not now, Sierra.

54:26.530 --> 54:28.497
What can we do
to get rid of that

54:28.499 --> 54:30.966
in front of the grate?

54:32.069 --> 54:35.070
          H... 2... O.

54:36.007 --> 54:40.476
  Think about it. Witches are
    scared of water, right?

54:40.478 --> 54:42.478
              Yes. Please, work.

54:42.480 --> 54:44.580
           I've also
        got wiccaphobia.

54:45.883 --> 54:47.650
        Fear of witches.

54:47.652 --> 54:50.586
           You ready?

54:50.588 --> 54:52.955
     Let's do this.

54:53.691 --> 54:55.524
           And we...
           (laughing)

54:55.526 --> 54:58.761
       ... can just watch
           from here.

54:58.763 --> 55:01.430
           Quick! Over here!
            Oh!

55:03.434 --> 55:05.701
           (growling)

55:06.103 --> 55:07.169
           You ready?

55:07.171 --> 55:08.570
           (cackling)

55:08.572 --> 55:10.506
            (grunts)
          Now!

55:10.508 --> 55:12.041
       (witch screaming)

55:12.043 --> 55:14.643
(Akimi)
I think I got her!

55:14.645 --> 55:17.479
          (screaming)

55:23.020 --> 55:24.186
                   Ah!

55:24.188 --> 55:25.988
        (all screaming)

55:25.990 --> 55:26.989
Run for the grate!

55:26.991 --> 55:30.225
(Kyle)
She's returning!
Stay on her!

55:30.227 --> 55:32.761
(grumbling)
              I think it worked!

55:40.237 --> 55:42.171
           (rumbling)
What was that?

55:42.173 --> 55:44.640
           Who cares?
       Just keep pulling.

55:44.642 --> 55:47.209
           (rumbling)

55:47.211 --> 55:49.511
You've got
to be kidding.

55:49.513 --> 55:52.614
               ¶¶

55:52.616 --> 55:55.517
The giant's coming.
           Holy cow.

55:55.519 --> 55:58.654
      That is the biggest,
            largest,

55:58.656 --> 56:00.789
      most enormous-- Aah!

56:00.791 --> 56:03.792
          Get it off!

56:03.794 --> 56:05.894
She's gone.
You guys okay?

56:05.896 --> 56:07.596
    Get in. Let's go.

56:07.598 --> 56:10.666
(giant)
Fee fi foh fum...

56:10.668 --> 56:13.235
          Are you okay, Pickle?
Yeah, I'm okay.

56:13.237 --> 56:16.805
All right.
Let's get out of here.
                  Follow me.

56:26.183 --> 56:28.951
      Hang in there, kids.

56:29.987 --> 56:31.587
Come on! Hurry!

56:31.589 --> 56:35.023
     Plus, I'm sure Sierra
      has claustrophobia.

56:35.025 --> 56:36.925
How'd you know?
               Wild guess.

56:36.927 --> 56:40.195
This is it. This is
where they blew the floor

56:40.197 --> 56:42.197
to get into the air duct.

56:42.199 --> 56:43.999
Look, another grate.

56:44.001 --> 56:47.903
          "The way out
        is the way in."

56:47.905 --> 56:50.205
    Come on.

56:50.207 --> 56:51.240
           Let's go.

56:51.242 --> 56:53.075
                           Okay.
                 Come on!

56:56.247 --> 56:58.714
           (growling)

56:59.917 --> 57:02.317
       (heavy breathing)

57:11.695 --> 57:13.195
               Whoa, whoa, whoa!

57:13.197 --> 57:15.864
          You saved me
      back there, Chilty.

57:15.866 --> 57:17.666
               Don't mention it.

57:17.668 --> 57:20.068
          Your parents
         will be proud.

57:21.338 --> 57:23.105
              Thanks, Peckleman.

57:23.107 --> 57:25.774
                  Now, let's get
                  out of here.

57:25.776 --> 57:27.810
           (groaning)

57:27.812 --> 57:30.245
                       (chatter)

57:32.817 --> 57:33.982
Stay close.

57:33.984 --> 57:37.753
        Oh, no. They've
       got us surrounded!

57:38.255 --> 57:39.888
              Hah!
        (all screaming)

57:39.890 --> 57:41.990
              Aah!

57:41.992 --> 57:44.793
Mr. Lemoncello,
it's you.

57:44.795 --> 57:46.628
           Of course.
         I'm always me.

57:46.630 --> 57:49.898
And you're wearing
a cat burglar outfit.

57:49.900 --> 57:53.802
Follow me. I've got
a splendiferocious plan.

57:54.905 --> 57:56.305
           Let's go.

57:56.841 --> 57:58.740
     They're gaining on us!
             We're almost there!

57:58.742 --> 58:02.277
Come on, let's go!
           Hurry!
           They're getting away!

58:05.716 --> 58:06.849
             What are you doing?

58:06.851 --> 58:08.350
I'm using what's left
of the dynamite

58:08.352 --> 58:11.353
the Dandy Bandits used to
blow the tunnel into the bank.

58:11.355 --> 58:14.723
Desperate times call
for desperate measures.

58:14.725 --> 58:16.925
A saying likely
originating from...

58:16.927 --> 58:18.794
             (all)
            Sierra!
      Sorry.

58:18.796 --> 58:22.064
Now, everyone take cover!
Go, go, go, go.

58:22.066 --> 58:23.932
There they are!

58:25.002 --> 58:27.636
     (growling and hissing)

58:34.745 --> 58:37.012
           (coughing)

58:40.784 --> 58:43.185
(Luigi)
It worked!

58:47.791 --> 58:49.391
                 That was...

58:49.393 --> 58:50.959
(Dr. Zinchenko)
Epic!

58:50.961 --> 58:53.896
      Dr. Z, you're okay!

58:53.898 --> 58:56.265
I've actually been
by myself in the library

58:56.267 --> 58:57.132
for the past half hour

58:57.134 --> 58:58.667
while everyone's
been chasing you all.

58:58.669 --> 59:02.905
          I'm sorry for stealing
          the golden key.

59:02.907 --> 59:04.072
       Please don't kick me out.

59:04.074 --> 59:06.775
Yes, well, it seems
you've redeemed yourself.

59:06.777 --> 59:10.045
Anyway, the good thing
about being alone up here

59:10.047 --> 59:14.983
was no one was able to stop me
from retrieving the key.

59:14.985 --> 59:15.751
                         No way!

59:15.753 --> 59:19.221
      Way! And as soon as
   Mr. L and I put both keys

59:19.223 --> 59:23.926
into the control room rig,
order will be restored and--

59:23.928 --> 59:26.094
         (all shouting)

59:26.864 --> 59:29.331
             Dr. Z!
       Are you all right?

59:29.333 --> 59:31.266
      Just splendiferous.

59:31.268 --> 59:33.702
(Scaradactyl screeching)
              What in the world?

59:33.704 --> 59:35.737
I don't recall
seeing a creature

59:35.739 --> 59:36.905
like that in any book.

59:36.907 --> 59:40.075
         That's because
      it's a Scaradactyl.

59:40.077 --> 59:41.443
                  A Scaradactyl?

59:41.445 --> 59:44.746
       A dinosaur monster
       hybrid I created.

59:44.748 --> 59:46.014
                      Watch out!

59:46.016 --> 59:47.316
        (all screaming)

59:47.318 --> 59:49.918
I knew that Imagination Room
was a bad idea.

59:49.920 --> 59:52.421
Get to safety!
We'll hold off this beast!

59:52.423 --> 59:56.224
       But I created her!
   This is my responsibility.

59:56.226 --> 01:00:01.229
           My fault.
Kyle, a great imagination
is never a fault.

01:00:01.231 --> 01:00:03.865
Now, go!
                    (whimpering)

01:00:03.867 --> 01:00:06.268
         (all shouting)

01:00:14.078 --> 01:00:15.911
Go, now!

01:00:15.913 --> 01:00:17.813
     (Scaradactyl growling)

01:00:17.815 --> 01:00:20.382
       Let's go! Come on!

01:00:22.987 --> 01:00:25.454
              Come on, Kyle.
              We have to go now!

01:00:25.456 --> 01:00:27.923
             But...

01:00:27.925 --> 01:00:30.826
        Watch out for her talons
        and her beak.

01:00:30.828 --> 01:00:34.196
      Her tail is her weak spot.

01:00:34.198 --> 01:00:36.298
        Thank you, Kyle.

01:00:36.300 --> 01:00:38.867
            Until we meet again.

01:00:38.869 --> 01:00:40.769
               ¶¶

01:00:44.041 --> 01:00:49.044
     You've messed with the
  wrong librarian, young lady!

01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:52.014
(Scaradactyl growling)
              Aah!

01:00:57.921 --> 01:01:00.889
                     This is it!
                     We did it!

01:01:00.891 --> 01:01:02.257
            Come on.

01:01:03.994 --> 01:01:05.994
           (groaning)

01:01:06.997 --> 01:01:10.265
        And it's locked.
           Of course.
Oh, come on!

01:01:10.267 --> 01:01:11.800
         (music chimes)

01:01:11.802 --> 01:01:13.035
                     Mrs. Tobin?

01:01:13.037 --> 01:01:17.105
         Yes! I kicked
       that troll's butt!

01:01:17.107 --> 01:01:18.006
        (clears throat)

01:01:18.008 --> 01:01:20.942
      In order to escape,
        you must deduce

01:01:20.944 --> 01:01:23.945
            the word combination
            to open this door.

01:01:23.947 --> 01:01:28.116
       Your hint is, once
       you learn how to do this,

01:01:28.118 --> 01:01:32.354
       you will be forever free.
       You have four minutes.

01:01:32.356 --> 01:01:35.123
              Come on. Can't you
              just open it?

01:01:35.125 --> 01:01:38.093
            I'm just a hologram.

01:01:41.265 --> 01:01:42.731
             (Kyle)
       <i> This is my fault.</i>

01:01:42.733 --> 01:01:44.766
             (Dad)
      <i> Kyle, you're gonna</i>
         <i> have to start</i>

01:01:44.768 --> 01:01:47.402
     <i> taking responsibility</i>
       <i> for your actions.</i>

01:01:47.404 --> 01:01:51.006
            (Luigi)
       <i> Thank you, Kyle.</i>
     <i> Until we meet again.</i>

01:01:52.376 --> 01:01:57.079
       Kyle, what are you doing?

01:01:57.081 --> 01:02:00.849
     Going to save my hero.

01:02:01.185 --> 01:02:04.252
      Now, let's get this puzzle
      solved, shall we?

01:02:04.254 --> 01:02:06.755
                Okay.
             Um...

01:02:06.757 --> 01:02:09.357
           (growling)
                (both screaming)

01:02:13.230 --> 01:02:15.363
(Kyle)
Not so fast!

01:02:15.365 --> 01:02:17.799
            Kyle, you came back!

01:02:17.801 --> 01:02:20.802
          With red balloons? Oh!
(screeching)

01:02:20.804 --> 01:02:23.472
Easy, girl. Easy, girl.

01:02:23.474 --> 01:02:25.107
              Very clever,
              using red balloons

01:02:25.109 --> 01:02:29.211
       to get her attention,
       just like a bull fighter.

01:02:29.213 --> 01:02:31.847
               ¶¶

01:02:37.955 --> 01:02:40.922
In a way, yes.

01:02:43.026 --> 01:02:46.862
    You know how you always
   say to be one step ahead?

01:02:46.864 --> 01:02:49.531
When it comes to
Scaradactyls,

01:02:49.533 --> 01:02:54.970
it's best to be
one step... behind.

01:02:56.340 --> 01:02:58.807
                       (roaring)

01:03:00.210 --> 01:03:02.811
       (both whimpering)

01:03:04.181 --> 01:03:06.248
          Bottoms up!

01:03:06.884 --> 01:03:08.183
             The balloons
             are lifting her up.

01:03:08.185 --> 01:03:11.253
Wait, how is that working?
That doesn't make any sense.

01:03:11.255 --> 01:03:15.524
That's the fun of
using your imagination.

01:03:15.526 --> 01:03:17.359
           (clinking)

01:03:18.929 --> 01:03:21.863
                 (Dr. Zinchenko)
                 My key!

01:03:22.933 --> 01:03:24.299
           (roaring)

01:03:24.301 --> 01:03:25.267
       How about "dream"?

01:03:25.269 --> 01:03:27.903
No, "dream"
is five letters.

01:03:27.905 --> 01:03:29.271
              Learn how to read,
              dude.

01:03:29.273 --> 01:03:32.140
    "Read." Not a bad idea,
          Chiltington.
Kyle!

01:03:32.142 --> 01:03:36.244
Think about it. Every puzzle has
   led us closer to freedom,

01:03:36.246 --> 01:03:38.413
      and the only reason
      we could solve them

01:03:38.415 --> 01:03:41.349
      was because of books
     and poems and stories

01:03:41.351 --> 01:03:43.218
   that we were able to read.

01:03:43.220 --> 01:03:45.387
Yeah. Like
"Romeo and Juliet."

01:03:45.389 --> 01:03:47.122
And "Charlotte's Web."

01:03:47.124 --> 01:03:48.623
   And "Grimm's Fairy Tales."

01:03:48.625 --> 01:03:50.292
       And even "Humpty Dumpty."

01:03:50.294 --> 01:03:52.360
         (all laughing)
Precisely!

01:03:52.362 --> 01:03:54.429
Reading set me free
all my life

01:03:54.431 --> 01:03:57.065
and it's gonna
set us all free now.

01:03:57.868 --> 01:03:58.533
                          "R"...

01:03:58.535 --> 01:04:00.235
             (all)
             "E"...

01:04:00.237 --> 01:04:01.336
             "A"...

01:04:01.338 --> 01:04:02.604
              "D"!

01:04:02.606 --> 01:04:04.005
            "Read"!

01:04:04.007 --> 01:04:06.241
         (all cheering)

01:04:09.346 --> 01:04:11.012
                            Yes!

01:04:12.549 --> 01:04:14.883
           (laughter)

01:04:16.253 --> 01:04:20.355
Let's escape this library
once and for all.

01:04:20.357 --> 01:04:22.624
3, 2, 1...

01:04:22.626 --> 01:04:24.226
               ¶¶

01:04:24.228 --> 01:04:27.262
     (cheers and applause)

01:05:02.933 --> 01:05:08.336
        And so, because
  the obstacles you all faced

01:05:08.338 --> 01:05:11.206
    were greater than I ever
      could have imagined,

01:05:11.208 --> 01:05:14.209
      and because you all
      faced them together,

01:05:14.211 --> 01:05:18.680
        as a team, it is
   my splendiferous pleasure

01:05:18.682 --> 01:05:23.218
  to declare you all winners!

01:05:23.220 --> 01:05:27.656
I present to you
the official spokespeople

01:05:27.658 --> 01:05:30.325
   of everything Lemoncello!

01:05:30.327 --> 01:05:33.028
     (cheers and applause)

01:05:35.532 --> 01:05:40.502
    I'm happy to report
    everything's been contained.

01:05:40.504 --> 01:05:42.704
               ¶¶

01:05:50.580 --> 01:05:52.180
       Now, if you'll excuse me,

01:05:52.182 --> 01:05:56.184
         I'm going to take
         a much-needed vacation.

01:05:57.287 --> 01:05:58.253
           (laughing)

01:05:58.255 --> 01:06:00.388
          Dad!
             Can you believe it?

01:06:00.390 --> 01:06:02.524
           (chatter)

01:06:11.702 --> 01:06:15.637
Hey, Chilty, need a ride?

01:06:16.773 --> 01:06:18.506
Thanks, Pickle.

01:06:18.508 --> 01:06:21.710
               You're all dirty.
                     Yeah.

01:06:21.712 --> 01:06:24.512
Kyle, I've created

01:06:24.514 --> 01:06:26.548
       all sorts of games
          in my time,

01:06:26.550 --> 01:06:29.250
  but never in a million years
      would I have dreamed

01:06:29.252 --> 01:06:31.419
          of something
       like a Scaradactyl

01:06:31.421 --> 01:06:33.588
that could be defeated
by balloons.

01:06:33.590 --> 01:06:37.225
That was genius,
not to mention you showed

01:06:37.227 --> 01:06:40.462
some serious boberious
banana-fana foderious

01:06:40.464 --> 01:06:42.263
leadership skills in there.

01:06:42.265 --> 01:06:43.698
           That's why
     I'd like to offer you

01:06:43.700 --> 01:06:45.233
          a summer job
         at my library,

01:06:45.235 --> 01:06:48.203
assuming, of course,
your parents approve.

01:06:48.205 --> 01:06:50.605
        Of course, son.
       I'm proud of you.

01:06:50.607 --> 01:06:51.740
                     We all are.

01:06:51.742 --> 01:06:54.275
       That's the coolest
          thing ever!

01:06:54.277 --> 01:06:58.513
Thunderific, Kyle.
You can start next week.

01:06:58.515 --> 01:07:00.348
Until then,

01:07:00.350 --> 01:07:04.119
why don't you
hold on to this for me?

01:07:04.121 --> 01:07:05.820
                           Whoa!

01:07:09.393 --> 01:07:12.560
        One last thing.

01:07:13.597 --> 01:07:18.733
     Remember to always be
         one step a...
