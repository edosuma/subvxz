03:34.215 --> 03:35.215
- Po.

03:40.887 --> 03:41.887
Hey, Po.

03:43.256 --> 03:44.656
- Where's mommy?

03:46.259 --> 03:48.827
Uh oh, it's dinnertime, daddy.

03:52.832 --> 03:53.832
Come on.

04:17.890 --> 04:20.625
- Po, Po, hey, it's okay.

04:20.628 --> 04:21.459
It's okay.

04:21.462 --> 04:22.694
- No, no!

04:22.696 --> 04:24.429
- Soft touch bad,
hard touch good.

04:24.431 --> 04:25.264
Come on, I got you.

04:25.266 --> 04:26.331
- No, no!

04:26.333 --> 04:29.134
- No, it's okay,
it's okay, yeah.

04:31.671 --> 04:33.305
Okay, daddy's got you.

04:33.307 --> 04:35.140
Yeah, yeah, daddy's got you.

04:35.142 --> 04:36.341
- Daddy's got me.

04:36.343 --> 04:38.910
- Shh, that's right,
daddy's got ya.

04:38.912 --> 04:39.845
- Daddy's got me.

04:39.847 --> 04:40.979
- Daddy's got ya.

04:46.086 --> 04:47.686
Something funny?

04:47.688 --> 04:49.588
- Daddy's a wrastler.

04:49.590 --> 04:52.291
- Yeah, yeah, very funny.

04:52.293 --> 04:53.792
- Watch out wrastler!

04:53.794 --> 04:55.460
- Yeah, you want the wrastler?

04:55.462 --> 04:57.362
You want the wrastler?

04:58.831 --> 05:00.499
Take that, wrastler!

05:01.968 --> 05:05.037
- It is the fifth straight
day of losses for the s&p 500.

05:05.039 --> 05:09.608
That's the longest losing
streak in 13 months' time.

05:09.610 --> 05:12.644
- Bloombergs is the
professional's choice.

05:12.646 --> 05:13.845
Listen to Po.

05:13.847 --> 05:16.014
- Po, I can't stay up all night.

05:16.016 --> 05:17.382
You have to go to bed.

05:19.086 --> 05:21.286
- Wall street journal.

05:21.288 --> 05:23.021
- Record on
December 29, you see there

05:23.023 --> 05:24.723
what crude oil is
doing right now,

05:24.725 --> 05:26.591
still trading
below $50 a barrel,

05:26.593 --> 05:28.994
and expanding those profits.

05:31.431 --> 05:33.765
- Oh, this one's for later.

05:49.182 --> 05:50.182
- Ew.

05:54.687 --> 05:56.088
What did you do?

05:58.725 --> 05:59.725
Oh, Po.

06:16.008 --> 06:18.076
- It's the rainbow, dad.

06:19.212 --> 06:21.613
- Why is it on the wall, Po?

06:22.382 --> 06:23.815
- It's your rainbow.

06:23.817 --> 06:25.650
- Okay, Po, new rule.

06:26.486 --> 06:28.787
No food on the walls, okay?

06:29.856 --> 06:31.690
No food on the walls.

06:32.558 --> 06:33.959
All right, come on.

06:33.961 --> 06:37.863
Let's go get some sponges
and clean this up.

06:37.865 --> 06:39.598
- It's your rainbow.

06:41.100 --> 06:42.834
Your rainbow, daddy.

06:46.439 --> 06:49.174
- Hey, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

06:49.176 --> 06:51.076
Come with me, come on.

07:01.487 --> 07:02.554
Here you go.

07:03.523 --> 07:05.690
- Autograph, please.

07:07.593 --> 07:09.361
- Why are we doing
this everyday?

07:09.363 --> 07:11.096
- Autograph, please.

07:12.198 --> 07:16.101
- Well, I am honored
to be the sole member

07:16.103 --> 07:17.736
of your autograph
collection, Po.

07:17.738 --> 07:19.004
- Mac and cheese, please.

07:19.006 --> 07:21.440
- No, we don't have Mac
and cheese today, buddy.

07:21.442 --> 07:23.942
- Calcium's good for your bones.

07:23.944 --> 07:27.012
- Yeah, well, this is
peanut butter and jelly

07:27.014 --> 07:30.582
which is known for it's simplicity
and budgetary properties.

07:30.584 --> 07:31.616
What happened to your face?

07:31.618 --> 07:32.818
- Mac and cheese, please.

07:32.820 --> 07:36.588
- No, Po, you have
to eat your sandwich.

07:36.590 --> 07:39.024
No, I am not doing this today.

07:39.026 --> 07:40.959
- Patrick's a nice
name for a boy,

07:40.961 --> 07:42.427
but I think I'll call you Po.

07:42.429 --> 07:45.697
- You need to eat your sandwich.

07:45.699 --> 07:46.898
- Where's mommy?

07:46.900 --> 07:48.333
- Fine, you don't wanna
eat it, I'll eat it.

07:48.335 --> 07:51.236
Mm, mm, oh, what a delicious,

07:51.238 --> 07:55.440
turns out dad makes a
mean Pb and j sandwich.

07:55.442 --> 07:57.576
- Don't be afraid, daddy.

08:00.346 --> 08:02.147
- Afraid of what, Po?

08:07.887 --> 08:10.021
- Yuck!

08:10.023 --> 08:11.023
- Yuck.

08:12.825 --> 08:15.527
- Mac and cheese, please.

08:15.529 --> 08:18.864
- The capital city
of Mississippi is?

08:18.866 --> 08:19.866
Anyone?

08:21.701 --> 08:22.701
Patrick.

08:25.204 --> 08:26.204
Po?

08:27.640 --> 08:31.243
Can you tell us what the
capital city of Mississippi is?

08:31.245 --> 08:34.246
- Hey, spaceman, the teacher
asked you a question.

08:34.248 --> 08:35.813
- Taylor, stop it.

08:36.916 --> 08:39.351
- You know the answer,
don't you, Patrick?

08:39.352 --> 08:43.655
- M-i-s-s-i-s-s-i-p-p-i.

08:43.657 --> 08:44.489
- What an idiot.

08:44.491 --> 08:46.057
- Stop it, Taylor.

08:47.627 --> 08:50.295
You know the answer, don't you?

08:51.531 --> 08:52.531
Po?

08:56.035 --> 08:58.003
It's Jackson, isn't it?

08:59.805 --> 09:03.808
So, the capital city
of Mississippi is?

09:03.810 --> 09:05.043
- Jackson.

09:05.045 --> 09:06.912
- Right, now can anybody tell me

09:06.914 --> 09:08.613
the capital of Alabama?

09:08.615 --> 09:09.447
- Good morning.

09:09.449 --> 09:10.449
- Morning.

09:14.353 --> 09:15.720
How we lookin'?

09:15.722 --> 09:17.289
- Oh, we're great.

09:17.291 --> 09:18.557
We've increased lift by 20%,

09:18.559 --> 09:20.125
but she still won't
get off the ground.

09:20.127 --> 09:21.526
- It's the weight
of the batteries.

09:21.528 --> 09:22.994
It is just too heavy, now.

09:22.996 --> 09:24.262
- Well we can't go any
bigger with the wing size.

09:24.264 --> 09:27.032
We may need a new
design altogether.

09:27.034 --> 09:29.034
- Maybe fewer seats.

09:29.036 --> 09:31.116
- That's a deal-breaker,
it's a 90-passenger minimum.

09:32.239 --> 09:33.505
- David, Randall
needs to speak with you

09:33.507 --> 09:34.706
in his office right away.

09:34.708 --> 09:36.641
- Yeah, I'll be right there.

09:43.382 --> 09:44.616
Be right back.

10:00.833 --> 10:02.367
- May I sit here?

10:05.138 --> 10:08.406
Everything in the world
is not in these books,

10:08.408 --> 10:09.908
but it's a start.

10:10.977 --> 10:12.911
I'm on mollusk.

10:12.913 --> 10:15.981
Shellfish, you know,
bottom feeders.

10:17.483 --> 10:19.618
Oh, I'm Amelia, by the way.

10:19.620 --> 10:20.885
Amelia Carr.

10:20.887 --> 10:22.053
I've moved here all
the way from London

10:22.055 --> 10:24.322
and I have two daddies.

10:24.324 --> 10:27.292
Pleasure to make
your acquaintance.

10:28.561 --> 10:30.462
Patrick, is it?

10:30.464 --> 10:32.130
- Patrick is a nice
name for a boy,

10:32.132 --> 10:34.766
but I think I'll call you Po.

10:34.768 --> 10:36.901
- Hm, a nickname.

10:36.903 --> 10:39.738
I'm not there yet, still on m.

10:39.740 --> 10:41.973
I have an aunt Constance
who we call ac,

10:41.975 --> 10:45.443
but that's more of an
acronym than a nickname.

10:45.445 --> 10:46.411
- Hey!

10:46.413 --> 10:49.080
I say you could sit down?

10:49.082 --> 10:50.949
- Friends of yours?

10:50.951 --> 10:52.917
- You need to ask my permission.

10:52.919 --> 10:54.653
- I must tell you,

10:54.655 --> 10:56.454
even though we're
just in sixth grade,

10:56.456 --> 10:58.857
people will judge us
by the company we keep.

10:58.859 --> 11:02.527
- I think the spaceman's
trying to fly away.

11:05.431 --> 11:07.932
What's wrong with you, freak?

11:09.268 --> 11:12.604
Look at you, you
won't even fight back.

11:20.213 --> 11:22.847
I guess today's your lucky day.

11:27.653 --> 11:30.989
- I think you handled
that very nicely.

11:42.835 --> 11:47.072
Po, I do believe we are
going to get along famously.

11:48.974 --> 11:52.477
- This plane is going to
change the game forever.

11:52.479 --> 11:54.879
One month, you buy me one month,

11:54.881 --> 11:57.916
and you'll see her
fly, I promise.

11:57.918 --> 12:00.618
- All right, I'll
see what I can do.

12:00.620 --> 12:02.554
But if you don't deliver,

12:02.556 --> 12:03.955
I'll be forced to
scrap the project,

12:03.957 --> 12:06.257
and you will be let go.

12:06.259 --> 12:07.592
- I understand.

12:16.035 --> 12:18.169
- Moving numbers.

12:18.171 --> 12:19.671
- What's that buddy?

12:19.673 --> 12:22.307
- Can you find the pattern?

12:22.309 --> 12:24.142
- Po, get some sleep.

12:25.644 --> 12:27.512
- Good night, daddy.

12:27.514 --> 12:29.914
- Good night, buddy.

12:34.887 --> 12:36.454
- Dancing numbers.

12:45.431 --> 12:46.798
- You know what I just realized?

12:46.800 --> 12:48.233
- What's that?

12:48.235 --> 12:50.502
- You're the second
smartest person I know.

12:54.874 --> 12:57.342
- All right, who's the first?

13:02.414 --> 13:04.883
What if I can't do this, Ben?

13:06.085 --> 13:07.519
All the promises I made?

13:07.521 --> 13:09.788
They will dead cap this
entire program, and then what?

13:09.790 --> 13:11.923
What am I gonna do?

13:11.925 --> 13:13.691
We spent all of our
savings, and then some,

13:13.693 --> 13:14.759
on Beth's medical bills.

13:14.761 --> 13:16.828
I have Po's expenses, I,

13:18.898 --> 13:20.398
this has to work.

13:21.834 --> 13:23.701
- What about your in-laws?

13:23.703 --> 13:25.370
- It's complicated.

13:28.707 --> 13:30.175
- Look, if it comes to it,

13:30.177 --> 13:31.342
I could loan you some.

13:31.344 --> 13:33.645
- No, no, come on, I'll manage.

13:33.647 --> 13:34.647
It's okay.

13:35.447 --> 13:36.281
- What am I saying?

13:36.283 --> 13:37.749
I'm broke anyway.

13:38.884 --> 13:41.085
It's the thought that
counts though, right?

13:41.087 --> 13:42.887
- Not as much as
some coffee would.

13:42.889 --> 13:43.889
- On it.

13:52.398 --> 13:53.364
- Hello?

13:53.366 --> 13:54.666
- Hi, Mr. Wilson.

13:54.668 --> 13:56.701
I have Patrick in the
nurse's office again.

13:56.703 --> 13:58.002
I think you should
come and pick him up.

13:58.004 --> 14:00.205
- Uh, yeah, yeah, thanks.

14:00.207 --> 14:02.040
I'll be right there.

14:08.414 --> 14:09.581
Hey, Cathy.

14:09.583 --> 14:11.249
- Oh, hey, Mr. Wilson.

14:11.251 --> 14:12.784
- Hey, Po.

14:12.786 --> 14:13.785
How you doing, buddy?

14:13.787 --> 14:14.787
How's that knee?

14:15.555 --> 14:16.788
- Bat transmission received.

14:16.790 --> 14:18.823
- Patrick, I've told you
not to play with that.

14:18.825 --> 14:21.326
He's obsessed with it.

14:21.328 --> 14:23.528
- Amelia Carr is
on the letter m.

14:23.530 --> 14:24.462
M for mollusks.

14:24.464 --> 14:25.663
- Okay, come here, come here.

14:25.665 --> 14:26.865
Let's sit down.

14:26.867 --> 14:28.933
We're gonna leave in
just a minute, sweetie.

14:28.935 --> 14:31.135
- Amelia Carr and I
get along famously.

14:31.137 --> 14:32.370
- Yeah.

14:32.372 --> 14:34.072
- The principal wants
to see you, Mr. Wilson.

14:34.074 --> 14:36.674
- Okay, here, Po hold this.

14:36.676 --> 14:38.810
I will be right back.

14:38.812 --> 14:41.045
- I'll be right back.

14:42.448 --> 14:44.549
- Come on, he slipped
and fell while playing?

14:44.551 --> 14:45.783
Someone pushed him.

14:45.785 --> 14:48.186
- They're kids, at that
age they roughhouse.

14:48.188 --> 14:49.187
We can't stop it all.

14:49.189 --> 14:50.355
- How 'bout most?

14:50.357 --> 14:51.856
Or just some?

14:51.858 --> 14:53.591
- My concern is that he's
making himself a target.

14:53.593 --> 14:55.093
- Making himself?

14:56.061 --> 14:57.996
Okay, he's different.

14:57.998 --> 14:59.564
- He's regressing.

14:59.566 --> 15:01.432
Mr. Wilson,
Patrick's autism is...

15:01.434 --> 15:02.800
- no, I know about his autism.

15:02.802 --> 15:04.402
I know all about his autism.

15:04.404 --> 15:05.637
I get all the reports.

15:05.639 --> 15:07.071
I see the testing.

15:07.073 --> 15:09.173
I pay for the therapy services.

15:09.175 --> 15:10.775
I'm the one driving him
around the neighborhood

15:10.777 --> 15:12.944
every night until
he falls asleep.

15:12.946 --> 15:14.712
And you know what?

15:14.714 --> 15:16.614
He won't even give me a hug.

15:16.616 --> 15:18.917
My son won't give me a hug,

15:18.919 --> 15:21.786
but that doesn't mean
I love him any less.

15:21.788 --> 15:25.657
And all I'm asking of you is
that you don't give up on him.

15:25.659 --> 15:28.493
- His language and communication,
his social behavior,

15:28.495 --> 15:32.163
his responsiveness, he's
isolating himself more and more.

15:32.165 --> 15:34.098
- All of which is
typical for a boy like Po

15:34.100 --> 15:35.667
recovering from trauma.

15:35.669 --> 15:38.403
- He isn't recovering,
he's getting worse.

15:38.405 --> 15:40.471
And I'm quite concerned.

15:40.473 --> 15:42.140
When we decided to
mainstream Patrick

15:42.142 --> 15:44.809
he was in a very
different place.

15:44.811 --> 15:47.345
Now, I think we need to consider
other schooling options.

15:47.347 --> 15:48.546
- I've seen those other options.

15:48.548 --> 15:50.048
You can forget it.

15:50.050 --> 15:52.250
- The special ed program has
really improved recently,

15:52.252 --> 15:54.619
especially working with
children like your son.

15:54.621 --> 15:58.790
- He has been reading since
he was three years old.

15:58.792 --> 16:00.591
He seems to understand
math concepts

16:00.593 --> 16:02.894
that I struggled with
in graduate school.

16:02.896 --> 16:04.595
He doesn't need
special education.

16:04.597 --> 16:07.098
He just needs the
regular old education

16:07.100 --> 16:09.300
that you're supposed
to be providing him.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.803
- He can't stay here
like this, Mr. Wilson.

16:11.805 --> 16:13.938
He's simply not thriving.

16:37.930 --> 16:38.930
- Hey, Po.

16:40.366 --> 16:42.867
Po, Po, hey, come
here for a second.

16:42.869 --> 16:43.935
- Okay.

16:46.372 --> 16:48.673
- Listen to me, it is not okay

16:48.675 --> 16:51.009
for other kids to
pick on you at school.

16:51.011 --> 16:51.976
So daddy's gonna teach you,

16:51.978 --> 16:54.879
hey, Po, Po, hey buddy, with me.

16:54.881 --> 16:56.314
Daddy's gonna teach you

16:56.316 --> 16:57.882
how to stand up for
yourself, you understand?

16:57.884 --> 16:58.716
- Stand up.

16:58.718 --> 16:59.951
- That's right!

16:59.953 --> 17:01.319
Okay, here, put
your hand in here.

17:01.321 --> 17:02.220
Okay, oh, come here.

17:02.222 --> 17:03.054
It's okay.

17:03.056 --> 17:04.355
Hey, it's okay.

17:04.357 --> 17:06.758
That goes in there, exactly.

17:09.161 --> 17:11.396
Left hand, just like that.

17:13.799 --> 17:14.632
Good.

17:14.634 --> 17:16.000
- Red balloons.

17:16.002 --> 17:17.667
- Okay, no, not red balloons,
not balloons, buddy.

17:17.670 --> 17:19.002
Hey, look at me, look at me.

17:19.005 --> 17:20.471
Right with me, okay.

17:20.473 --> 17:22.306
Hands like this,
hands like this.

17:22.308 --> 17:24.608
Nope, down, like
this, like this.

17:24.611 --> 17:26.611
Hands like this.

17:26.613 --> 17:28.679
Good, good, there we go.

17:28.681 --> 17:31.616
Now, I want you to
hit daddy's hands.

17:31.618 --> 17:33.384
Hit my hands.

17:33.386 --> 17:34.452
- No thanks.

17:36.755 --> 17:37.755
- Po.

17:41.827 --> 17:42.827
Po.

17:46.066 --> 17:47.066
Po.

17:49.835 --> 17:52.870
Po, I'm just trying to help.

17:52.872 --> 17:55.006
- Okay, daddy.

17:55.008 --> 17:56.741
Quiet time.

17:56.743 --> 17:57.975
- All right buddy.

17:57.977 --> 17:58.910
Be careful with
your mom's scarf.

17:58.912 --> 18:00.845
- Okay, bye daddy.

19:24.596 --> 19:26.764
- Ahoy there, landlubber.

19:27.699 --> 19:28.699
- Jack?

19:29.735 --> 19:32.803
- The name is
captain long beard.

19:33.872 --> 19:36.240
- You mean black beard.

19:36.242 --> 19:37.242
- Right.

19:38.177 --> 19:39.177
Well, yes.

19:42.948 --> 19:46.083
I was wondering if you
could help me, please.

19:46.085 --> 19:48.252
I, uh, well I can't
seem to remember

19:48.254 --> 19:50.655
where I buried me treasure.

19:50.657 --> 19:52.823
- Don't you have a map?

19:52.825 --> 19:55.660
- A map, oh, that's
a great idea!

19:57.496 --> 19:59.530
You're a smart one, Po.

19:59.532 --> 20:02.166
- Po, dinnertime.

20:02.168 --> 20:03.734
- I have to go.

20:03.736 --> 20:04.902
See ya later.

20:06.305 --> 20:11.075
- Bring me back some of them
noodles with the golden sauce.

20:11.077 --> 20:12.877
- Po, Po, dinnertime.

20:16.682 --> 20:18.849
- Mac and cheese, please.

20:20.118 --> 20:21.118
- Come on.

20:24.056 --> 20:27.091
- Ouchie, ouchie,
it hurts daddy.

20:27.093 --> 20:30.761
- Come on, Po, come
on, you can do it.

20:30.763 --> 20:31.763
Okay, okay.

20:34.132 --> 20:36.400
I know, I know, just
try and relax, okay?

20:36.402 --> 20:37.535
Breathe.

20:37.537 --> 20:39.103
- Okay, ouch.

20:39.105 --> 20:40.972
Patrick's a nice name for a boy,

20:40.974 --> 20:42.707
but I think I'll call you Po.

20:42.709 --> 20:45.309
- I know it sucks,
buddy, I know it sucks.

20:45.311 --> 20:46.611
I know it does.

20:46.613 --> 20:47.578
This is why daddy
tries to tell you

20:47.580 --> 20:50.081
to eat your vegetables, honey.

20:50.083 --> 20:52.617
- Where's mommy?

20:52.619 --> 20:53.584
- Daddy's here, okay?

20:53.586 --> 20:54.586
I'm here.

20:55.754 --> 20:57.154
- Where's mommy?

20:58.423 --> 21:00.925
And bench stocks took
another beating today.

21:00.927 --> 21:02.193
They just can't seem to get out

21:02.195 --> 21:05.096
of the crosshairs
of the regulators.

21:05.098 --> 21:08.966
From the bailouts to the Libor
and the fx scandals to now,

21:08.968 --> 21:11.769
cyber security breaches.

21:11.771 --> 21:14.872
The real question out there
is, do we need banks at all?

21:14.874 --> 21:16.374
It's truly only a matter of time

21:16.376 --> 21:19.910
'til Google or apple
displaces them.

21:19.912 --> 21:21.646
That's worth noting.

21:23.482 --> 21:25.082
- All right, buddy.

21:25.084 --> 21:26.584
Time for bed now.

21:26.586 --> 21:30.121
- Amelia Carr is
on the letter m.

21:30.123 --> 21:32.356
- Is Amelia a friend
of yours at school?

21:32.358 --> 21:34.125
- She has two daddies.

21:34.127 --> 21:35.559
- Oh yeah?

21:35.561 --> 21:38.262
Well, you only have one daddy,

21:38.264 --> 21:39.730
and he has to get back to work,

21:39.732 --> 21:40.732
so bed.

21:43.602 --> 21:46.003
- Did mommy get this for me?

21:49.441 --> 21:50.508
- No, buddy.

21:51.610 --> 21:54.011
Daddy bought this for mommy.

21:55.380 --> 21:57.648
And it is very special.

21:57.650 --> 22:00.351
- Don't be afraid, daddy.

22:00.353 --> 22:02.119
- Afraid of what, Po?

22:04.056 --> 22:05.056
- Wrastler.

22:07.392 --> 22:08.225
- Goodnight, sweetie.

22:08.227 --> 22:09.860
- Goodnight, daddy.

22:12.664 --> 22:14.765
- Sleep tight, buddy.

22:23.675 --> 22:24.675
More lift.

22:26.712 --> 22:28.946
That's all there is to it.

22:39.257 --> 22:41.859
- The musk ox, or
Ovibos Moschatus,

22:41.861 --> 22:44.862
is quite unusual in that
both male and female members

22:44.864 --> 22:47.365
of the species grow horns.

22:47.367 --> 22:49.033
How magnificent.

22:49.035 --> 22:50.267
- Magnificent.

22:53.405 --> 22:54.638
- Turn around.

23:01.513 --> 23:05.383
- Welcome to
the aquarium by the sea.

23:05.385 --> 23:08.152
- I'm primarily opposed to
the caging of wild animals,

23:08.154 --> 23:10.921
but if I was a fish, this
is the place I would pick.

23:10.923 --> 23:14.291
We can be carnivores,
that is, eaters of meat,

23:14.293 --> 23:18.062
and still treat animals with
general regard and dignity.

23:18.064 --> 23:20.398
Don't you agree, Po?

23:20.400 --> 23:21.999
- Let's put the
dummy in the tank.

23:22.001 --> 23:23.001
- Taylor.

23:36.148 --> 23:37.815
- I wouldn't call
myself an expert

23:37.817 --> 23:40.418
though I am fairly well-read
on the subject of sharks

23:40.420 --> 23:42.753
the Mako shark, to
be more specific.

23:42.755 --> 23:45.189
Did you know that the Mako
shark is capable of swimming

23:45.191 --> 23:48.526
at speeds of up to
40 miles per hour?

23:48.528 --> 23:50.428
Most people have
a fear of sharks,

23:50.430 --> 23:52.763
but they are more afraid
of us than we are them,

23:52.765 --> 23:54.298
and for good reason.

23:54.300 --> 23:58.235
Over 100 million sharks are
killed every year by humans.

23:59.371 --> 24:00.871
- There you are.

24:00.873 --> 24:02.773
Please don't wander away from
the rest of the class, okay?

24:02.775 --> 24:03.607
- Okay.

24:03.609 --> 24:06.243
- Not today.

24:06.245 --> 24:07.845
- This is going to be the first

24:07.847 --> 24:10.614
hybrid commercial
aircraft in the world.

24:10.616 --> 24:11.982
It is good for the planet.

24:11.984 --> 24:13.751
It is great for the airlines

24:13.753 --> 24:15.920
who are going to save
hundreds of millions

24:15.922 --> 24:17.421
in gallons of fuel.

24:17.423 --> 24:19.423
- And how many gallons of
fuel is it going to save us

24:19.425 --> 24:21.592
while it's sitting
on the ground?

24:21.594 --> 24:23.294
- Well, technically, if
it's sitting on the ground

24:23.296 --> 24:24.795
you're not using fuel at all.

24:24.797 --> 24:25.796
- That's enough, Ben.

24:25.798 --> 24:27.698
- My team and I are very close.

24:27.700 --> 24:29.200
The batteries are efficient,

24:29.202 --> 24:30.835
they're very heavy so we've
had to completely overhaul

24:30.837 --> 24:33.037
traditional wing design
to reach our goals...

24:33.039 --> 24:36.140
- which remains entirely
theoretical at this point.

24:36.142 --> 24:39.276
- It's not theoretical,
it's innovative.

24:39.278 --> 24:40.878
- I remember you telling me

24:40.880 --> 24:45.449
you wanted this company to
be founded on innovation.

24:45.451 --> 24:46.851
That's what I'm doing.

24:46.853 --> 24:48.953
I just need more time.

24:48.955 --> 24:52.790
- Two years ago, when we
engaged in this hybrid project,

24:52.792 --> 24:55.626
we shared in your
confidence, Mr. Wilson.

24:55.628 --> 24:58.729
But the truth is, at this
point, we are losing money.

24:58.731 --> 24:59.964
The board is not unsympathetic

24:59.966 --> 25:01.832
to what you've been
through recently,

25:01.834 --> 25:03.934
however, we have
other considerations.

25:03.936 --> 25:06.537
- Thank you, but
this plane will fly.

25:06.539 --> 25:08.072
And when it does,

25:08.074 --> 25:10.241
this company will be years
ahead of its competition.

25:10.243 --> 25:14.578
- David, would you say
another 30 days would be fair

25:14.580 --> 25:18.349
to continue with the project
to achieve our next milestone?

25:18.351 --> 25:19.183
- I think...

25:19.185 --> 25:20.417
- excuse me.

25:20.419 --> 25:22.019
Mr. Wilson, it's a call
from your son's nanny.

25:22.021 --> 25:24.188
Her car broke down and
she can't pick Po up

25:24.190 --> 25:27.024
from sensory
integration therapy.

25:27.859 --> 25:29.426
- Thank you, Peggy.

25:29.428 --> 25:30.861
Don't go, I'm sure
he'll be all right

25:30.863 --> 25:32.930
by himself for a while.

25:32.932 --> 25:36.667
- I'm sorry, Randall,
I need to go.

25:36.669 --> 25:38.569
We will continue this.

25:39.838 --> 25:41.805
My apologies, everyone.

25:45.777 --> 25:48.846
- Very good, all
right, now hold on.

25:50.815 --> 25:51.649
- Daddy!

25:51.651 --> 25:52.783
- Oh.
- Hey.

25:52.785 --> 25:53.617
- Hi.

25:53.619 --> 25:55.653
- Daddy, this is Amy.

25:55.655 --> 25:56.487
- Hi.

25:56.489 --> 25:57.321
- She's pretty.

25:57.323 --> 25:59.890
- Oh, okay.

25:59.892 --> 26:02.226
All right, well, we are
moving to the swing now.

26:02.228 --> 26:04.662
- Wow, he really
likes this room.

26:04.664 --> 26:06.297
- Is this your first
time at the center?

26:06.299 --> 26:10.034
- Yeah, well, I've been
taking him to a lot

26:10.036 --> 26:12.636
of therapy appointments, lately
but it's my first time here.

26:12.638 --> 26:15.673
Not here in this center,
just here in this room.

26:15.675 --> 26:17.041
- Right, got it.

26:17.043 --> 26:18.909
- So, how does
all this help him?

26:18.911 --> 26:20.077
It looks like a
playground in here.

26:20.079 --> 26:21.845
- This is sensory integration.

26:21.847 --> 26:25.916
So the human body is designed
to read its environment.

26:25.918 --> 26:28.218
Your brain is constantly
receiving signals

26:28.220 --> 26:32.056
from each and every one
of countless receptors

26:32.058 --> 26:34.124
in and on your body.

26:34.126 --> 26:37.227
So, imagine if your
clothing, like,

26:37.229 --> 26:39.096
constantly felt itchy to you

26:39.098 --> 26:42.032
would you be able to then
concentrate on your job?

26:42.034 --> 26:46.103
Or, if you weren't
able to tune out sound

26:46.105 --> 26:48.472
would you be able to
solve a math problem

26:48.474 --> 26:50.808
while hearing your
neighbors arguing?

26:50.810 --> 26:54.178
Without the ability to
reflexively manage the system

26:54.180 --> 26:57.715
we would feel totally overwhelmed
and constantly lose focus.

26:57.717 --> 27:00.217
Which is Po's struggle.

27:00.219 --> 27:02.987
So here, we are
therapeutically training

27:02.989 --> 27:05.789
his nervous system
to manage itself.

27:05.791 --> 27:07.291
- Wow, thank you.

27:07.293 --> 27:08.225
- For what?

27:08.227 --> 27:09.360
- I just have been taking him

27:09.362 --> 27:10.861
to all these
therapy appointments

27:10.863 --> 27:12.196
and no one really takes
the time to explain to me

27:12.198 --> 27:14.031
exactly how they're helping him.

27:14.033 --> 27:18.268
- Well, honestly, feel free
to ask anything any time.

27:19.604 --> 27:21.939
Po, you wanna do music?

27:21.941 --> 27:23.207
- Music time.

27:23.209 --> 27:25.175
- Yeah, would you
mind pressing play

27:25.177 --> 27:27.044
on that little boom box?

27:27.046 --> 27:28.046
- Oh, sure.

27:31.884 --> 27:33.317
Oh, hey, you like
Billy idol, too?

27:33.319 --> 27:35.619
- No, not me, that's
Po's favorite.

27:35.621 --> 27:36.687
- Seriously?

27:36.689 --> 27:37.955
- Do you wanna actually help?

27:37.957 --> 27:39.189
You can push him on the swing

27:39.191 --> 27:40.457
while I see if he can
catch some of these.

27:40.459 --> 27:43.027
- Uh, yeah, sure, okay.

27:43.029 --> 27:44.795
- Daddy's a wrastler.

27:44.797 --> 27:46.463
- What's wrastler?

27:46.465 --> 27:48.132
- I wrestled in high school.

27:48.134 --> 27:49.433
His mom showed him
the picture once,

27:49.435 --> 27:50.534
and I think it kinda stuck.

27:50.536 --> 27:51.468
- Mm.

27:51.470 --> 27:52.569
- Ready?

27:52.571 --> 27:54.238
- All right, ready Po?

27:54.240 --> 27:55.639
One, two, three.

27:59.278 --> 28:00.577
Good job.

28:02.415 --> 28:03.415
- Wow!

28:05.117 --> 28:06.483
Fly daddy!

28:06.485 --> 28:08.719
- Pretty cool, isn't it, Po?

28:08.721 --> 28:10.854
- Spin, daddy, spin.

28:10.856 --> 28:13.390
- Watch this, he's spinning.

28:13.392 --> 28:14.458
- I can fly?

28:15.560 --> 28:18.595
- I don't think so, it's
harder than it looks.

28:18.597 --> 28:19.863
Barrel roll.

28:19.865 --> 28:21.131
- Careful, daddy.

28:23.202 --> 28:24.401
- I can fly.

28:24.403 --> 28:25.403
Po can fly.

28:26.404 --> 28:29.139
- Okay, okay, okay, now hold on.

28:29.141 --> 28:30.641
Now, there we go.

28:31.476 --> 28:33.310
Ready, put your thumbs on there.

28:33.312 --> 28:35.779
Nice and easy, nice and easy.

28:37.415 --> 28:38.348
- Okay, daddy.

28:38.350 --> 28:40.350
- Good, Po, that's great.

28:40.352 --> 28:43.220
All right, now pull
up just a little.

28:43.222 --> 28:45.389
No, that's too hard, buddy, Po.

28:48.260 --> 28:49.860
- It's broken.

28:49.862 --> 28:51.095
- Yeah, it is.

29:03.775 --> 29:05.776
Po can fly, huh?

29:05.778 --> 29:07.244
- Maybe next time.

29:11.015 --> 29:12.015
- Hello.

29:12.717 --> 29:15.018
Yeah, no, I know how bad,

29:15.020 --> 29:16.186
yes, Randall.

29:18.089 --> 29:20.457
Yes, you know I would never.

29:21.659 --> 29:24.361
Yes, yes, I will,
you know I will.

29:24.363 --> 29:26.163
Yes, you know I will.

29:30.135 --> 29:31.135
Yes.

29:35.807 --> 29:37.441
Thank you, Randall.

29:46.851 --> 29:48.452
Two weeks at,

29:48.454 --> 29:49.454
Po, Po!

29:50.155 --> 29:51.155
Freeze, freeze!

29:54.026 --> 29:56.493
- That was a big ouchie.

29:56.495 --> 29:58.629
- You are a very brave boy, Po.

29:58.631 --> 29:59.563
Do you hear me?

29:59.565 --> 30:00.565
Very brave.

30:03.168 --> 30:04.268
- Wilson?

30:04.270 --> 30:05.969
- Yeah.

30:05.971 --> 30:08.038
- Bill haze, child
social services.

30:08.040 --> 30:09.573
Can I have a word with
you outside, please?

30:09.575 --> 30:11.942
- Uh, what do you
need to talk to me about?

30:11.944 --> 30:15.145
- I think outside
would be better.

30:15.147 --> 30:16.647
- Hey, Po, I'll be right back.

30:16.649 --> 30:18.048
Stay here, okay?

30:18.050 --> 30:19.449
Stay right here.

30:20.351 --> 30:21.518
- Big ouchie.

30:24.289 --> 30:25.722
- Okay,

30:26.992 --> 30:28.258
let's forgo the bullshit speech

30:28.260 --> 30:29.927
about me not being the enemy.

30:29.929 --> 30:32.029
- Listen, I take
good care of my son.

30:32.031 --> 30:33.831
- The
bruises, Mr. Wilson.

30:33.833 --> 30:35.465
- What bruises?

30:35.467 --> 30:38.168
- The attending physician
noted 17 separate

30:38.170 --> 30:40.237
and aged bruises
on your son's body.

30:40.239 --> 30:42.573
- All kids have accidents.

30:42.575 --> 30:43.841
- No, actually that's not true.

30:43.843 --> 30:45.542
- Well then, what're
you trying to say?

30:45.544 --> 30:48.212
Are you telling me
that I hurt my son?

30:48.214 --> 30:50.314
Because Po's not
like other kids, he...

30:50.316 --> 30:51.548
- he has autism.

30:51.550 --> 30:54.751
- Yes, and since his
mother died, especially,

30:54.753 --> 30:56.854
he doesn't pay attention
to his surroundings,

30:56.856 --> 30:58.889
so sometimes he has accidents.

30:58.891 --> 30:59.890
- He gets hurt a lot.

30:59.892 --> 31:02.025
- Sometimes, not because of me.

31:02.027 --> 31:04.294
- Yeah, we've already
established that.

31:04.296 --> 31:06.697
- Then why do I feel like
you don't believe me?

31:06.699 --> 31:08.999
- Okay, we need the speech.

31:09.001 --> 31:11.902
I get called in when
children get hurt.

31:11.904 --> 31:13.704
I try to see those hurts
don't happen again.

31:13.706 --> 31:15.239
I take this very seriously

31:15.241 --> 31:16.940
'cause I've seen the
price of failure.

31:16.942 --> 31:17.942
- Good.

31:19.177 --> 31:22.946
- I'm not your enemy, I'm
your child's advocate.

31:22.948 --> 31:25.649
By the way, that
should make us friends,

31:25.651 --> 31:27.851
but it probably won't.

31:27.853 --> 31:30.153
I don't make decisions
about anything.

31:30.155 --> 31:32.589
I take notes and I
make recommendations.

31:32.591 --> 31:34.491
I've studied very
hard to get here.

31:34.493 --> 31:36.260
And I've mentored under
some of the best veterans

31:36.262 --> 31:37.494
in my department.

31:37.496 --> 31:38.829
And in that time I've
dealt with the cases

31:38.831 --> 31:41.031
of more than 300 children.

31:41.033 --> 31:44.368
Now, it's your legal
and god-given right

31:44.370 --> 31:47.104
to disagree with me, but please,

31:48.706 --> 31:52.075
don't ever tell me I
don't know my business.

31:52.077 --> 31:53.677
- I didn't say you don't
know how to do your job.

31:53.679 --> 31:56.079
I said I didn't hurt my son.

31:59.851 --> 32:02.519
- Okay, David, I'll be in touch.

32:12.263 --> 32:13.263
- Great.

33:02.180 --> 33:04.281
- I don't get it.

33:04.283 --> 33:06.049
- It's about loving yourself,

33:06.051 --> 33:09.619
being confident, and enjoying
your life to the fullest.

33:09.621 --> 33:12.689
- Wow, you got all
that from a song?

33:14.225 --> 33:15.225
- Yep.

33:18.229 --> 33:20.230
- Look what I invented.

33:21.933 --> 33:23.000
Marshmallow,

33:26.404 --> 33:27.704
Graham cracker,

33:31.242 --> 33:32.242
chocolate.

33:33.978 --> 33:35.545
I'm gonna be rich.

33:38.449 --> 33:41.284
- Um, it's called
a S'more, Jack.

33:43.654 --> 33:45.455
- Oh, that's perfect.

33:46.524 --> 33:48.258
You're a genius, Po.

33:49.794 --> 33:52.763
J-e-n-i-o-u-s.

33:52.765 --> 33:57.634
- Jack, genius is
spelled g-e-n-i-u-s.

33:57.636 --> 34:00.971
- Thank you
for that information.

34:07.278 --> 34:09.545
- Two weeks left,
how're we doing?

34:09.547 --> 34:10.880
- Could not be better.

34:10.882 --> 34:12.482
- You wouldn't lie to
your boss, would you?

34:12.484 --> 34:14.384
- Well, if I would,
I would lie to you,

34:14.386 --> 34:16.585
and tell you that I wouldn't.

34:16.588 --> 34:17.588
- Right.

34:22.460 --> 34:23.527
- Two weeks.

34:24.495 --> 34:25.495
- Yeah.

34:33.137 --> 34:35.472
- Get out of my way, freak.

35:10.108 --> 35:11.741
- Hey, Mr. Wilson.

35:11.743 --> 35:13.043
- Hey, Amy, hi.

35:14.112 --> 35:18.148
- Hi, they having a
sale on Mac and cheese?

35:18.150 --> 35:19.483
- Uh, yes, yes.

35:20.718 --> 35:22.319
It's for Patrick.

35:22.321 --> 35:23.553
- You might wanna get him

35:23.555 --> 35:26.156
to eat some Greens
once in a while.

35:27.125 --> 35:28.558
- There's actually a website

35:28.560 --> 35:30.026
that teaches you how
to get vegetables

35:30.028 --> 35:31.561
inside your kid's Mac and
cheese without them noticing.

35:31.563 --> 35:32.996
It's genius.

35:32.998 --> 35:34.831
- Wow, I'm impressed.

35:36.767 --> 35:38.034
- That's a lot of water.

35:38.036 --> 35:40.403
- Oh, yeah, it's for
the kids at the center.

35:40.405 --> 35:41.405
- Nice.

35:43.508 --> 35:45.709
Do you need some help
getting it to your car?

35:45.711 --> 35:48.678
- Yes, please.

35:48.680 --> 35:52.349
- So, turns out, he'd memorized
the number to yellow cab,

35:52.351 --> 35:53.884
he called himself a taxi,

35:53.886 --> 35:56.219
he was halfway to Santa Monica
pier by the time I found him.

35:56.221 --> 35:58.155
- Santa Monica pier, why?

35:58.157 --> 35:59.890
- Well, probably
because his mom and I

35:59.892 --> 36:03.393
used to take him
there all the time.

36:03.395 --> 36:05.996
I'm sorry, does that
story sound a bit,

36:05.998 --> 36:08.064
I mean, I do keep
a close eye on him.

36:08.066 --> 36:08.999
I just...

36:09.001 --> 36:12.002
- no, no, don't be so sensitive.

36:12.004 --> 36:14.070
Po is a total character.

36:15.239 --> 36:17.440
And also, a lot of
kids with autism

36:17.442 --> 36:20.010
tend to run off for no reason.

36:21.345 --> 36:22.979
- I just wish that I could
get inside his head sometimes,

36:22.981 --> 36:24.848
you know, and see
what he's thinking.

36:24.850 --> 36:26.650
- Yeah, yeah, me too.

36:29.087 --> 36:30.153
- Oh, sorry.

36:32.123 --> 36:35.125
Okay, I have to
relieve Po's nanny,

36:35.127 --> 36:38.695
so I will see you you
sometime, I suppose.

36:39.497 --> 36:40.664
You know, no, of course,

36:40.666 --> 36:43.533
I'll see you at
occupational therapy.

36:43.535 --> 36:47.070
- Do you wanna take
down my number?

36:47.072 --> 36:48.438
- Okay.

36:50.876 --> 36:51.876
- Here.

36:55.780 --> 36:57.447
That's my cell.

36:57.449 --> 36:59.249
- Smiley face, no one
does that anymore.

36:59.251 --> 37:03.420
- I'm old school, so
feel free to call me anytime.

37:04.422 --> 37:06.189
Bye, Mr. Wilson.

37:06.191 --> 37:07.691
- David.

37:07.693 --> 37:08.858
- Bye, David.

37:28.512 --> 37:30.313
- Oh, it's a rainbow.

37:32.417 --> 37:34.050
- Uh, where's your son's room?

37:34.052 --> 37:35.352
- Uh, this way.

37:38.522 --> 37:40.190
He's right in here.

37:44.161 --> 37:45.362
- How often does he do that?

37:45.364 --> 37:46.563
- Oh, every once in a while.

37:46.565 --> 37:49.266
You know, it's
comforting to him.

37:49.268 --> 37:50.100
- May I?

37:50.102 --> 37:51.668
- Yeah, of course.

37:52.603 --> 37:53.603
- Patrick.

37:55.306 --> 37:56.306
Patrick.

37:57.642 --> 37:58.642
- Po.

38:00.077 --> 38:02.012
- Patrick's a nice
name for a boy,

38:02.014 --> 38:04.981
but I think I'll call you Po.

38:04.983 --> 38:06.416
- Well, hey, Po.

38:06.418 --> 38:07.784
My name's bill.

38:07.786 --> 38:08.918
- Okay, bill.

38:13.091 --> 38:14.824
- So, what'd you eat
that made you so burpy?

38:14.826 --> 38:16.059
- Mac and cheese.

38:16.061 --> 38:17.460
- Po, tell him what
you had for lunch.

38:17.462 --> 38:18.728
- Mac and cheese, please.

38:18.730 --> 38:20.830
- No, no, buddy, you had
peanut butter and jelly.

38:20.832 --> 38:23.300
- Yuck, no, thank you.

38:23.302 --> 38:25.001
- He's being silly.

38:25.003 --> 38:27.404
I mix vegetables into his
Mac and cheese all the time.

38:27.406 --> 38:28.805
He has no idea.

38:28.807 --> 38:30.473
- It's okay.

38:30.475 --> 38:31.841
For what it's worth,

38:31.843 --> 38:34.611
your burp smells just
like Mac and cheese.

38:37.349 --> 38:40.583
Seven cheese Manicotti, mm-mm.

38:40.585 --> 38:42.485
- Okay, bye bye, bill.

38:48.292 --> 38:51.294
- This probably wasn't
the best day for us to...

38:51.296 --> 38:52.729
- it never is.

38:52.731 --> 38:54.164
- I just, I just mean the...

38:54.166 --> 38:57.200
- listen, I'll be putting
in a recommendation

38:57.202 --> 38:58.968
for dismissal of any
further investigation

38:58.970 --> 39:00.704
into abuse and neglect
in this matter.

39:00.706 --> 39:01.905
- That's great, thank you.

39:01.907 --> 39:03.473
I appreciate that.

39:05.910 --> 39:08.812
- That was the official part.

39:08.814 --> 39:12.048
- Okay, what's,
what's the unofficial?

39:13.551 --> 39:16.119
- There's a residential
treatment center in Calabasas,

39:16.121 --> 39:18.121
state subsidized,
some federal grants.

39:18.123 --> 39:21.057
I know the director quite well.

39:21.059 --> 39:22.692
- I'm sorry, you want
me to put Po in a home?

39:22.694 --> 39:23.526
Forget it.

39:23.528 --> 39:25.128
- It's not a home.

39:25.130 --> 39:27.330
It's a facility that
provides schooling

39:27.332 --> 39:30.533
and applied behavioral care
for children with autism.

39:30.535 --> 39:32.102
It's a more aggressive
stance, for sure,

39:32.104 --> 39:34.037
but it might just
be what Po needs.

39:34.039 --> 39:36.773
- Okay, I can handle
him here, thank you.

39:36.775 --> 39:40.243
- What do intend to do if
your son continues to drift?

39:40.245 --> 39:41.378
- Drift?

39:41.380 --> 39:44.481
- He's moving
somewhere in his mind.

39:44.483 --> 39:47.684
I've seen it before
with other children.

39:47.686 --> 39:50.019
- We all drift in and
out sometimes, don't we?

39:50.021 --> 39:51.521
- You and I do, yes,

39:51.523 --> 39:53.923
and then we come back.

39:53.925 --> 39:58.161
Some children, like Po,
drift and don't come back.

39:59.096 --> 40:01.197
- I'm with Po every day.

40:01.199 --> 40:03.833
I think I know
what's best for him.

40:03.835 --> 40:06.736
- You're in a very unique
position, Mr. Wilson,

40:06.738 --> 40:09.038
single dad, special needs son,

40:09.040 --> 40:11.541
it's not very common.

40:11.543 --> 40:13.643
I know we guys like
to convince ourselves

40:13.645 --> 40:15.912
that there's glory in
the struggle, but...

40:15.914 --> 40:18.047
- okay, you're right
about one thing.

40:18.049 --> 40:19.249
- What's that, David?

40:19.251 --> 40:21.718
- We are not going
to be friends.

41:40.831 --> 41:42.065
- Where is he?

41:43.000 --> 41:44.834
- Ooh, that was a close one.

41:44.836 --> 41:46.336
- You're telling me.

41:46.338 --> 41:47.670
- Come with me.

41:48.873 --> 41:52.041
- Patrick, come out
and play with us.

41:52.043 --> 41:54.377
We're not gonna hurt you.

41:54.379 --> 41:55.379
We promise.

41:57.581 --> 41:59.315
Come on, let's look over there.

41:59.317 --> 42:01.084
We're gonna find you.

42:08.259 --> 42:10.093
- Don't you just love it here?

42:10.095 --> 42:12.061
- Of course I do.

42:12.063 --> 42:15.899
- And if you want to Po,
you can live here forever.

42:15.901 --> 42:17.934
- What do you mean?

42:17.936 --> 42:19.102
- You'll see.

42:24.275 --> 42:28.845
- Worldwide sales rose
8.2% in the fourth quarter.

42:28.847 --> 42:31.581
8.2% in the fourth quarter,

42:33.083 --> 42:35.718
that's worth noting, 8.2%.

42:49.700 --> 42:51.134
- Hey Po, do you know

42:51.136 --> 42:53.303
if your dad knows how
to use a telephone?

42:53.305 --> 42:55.271
- Daddy's great.

42:55.273 --> 42:56.573
- Oh.

42:56.575 --> 42:57.540
- Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk.

42:57.542 --> 43:00.176
- Po, daddy's been very busy.

43:00.178 --> 43:03.046
- Which one should I believe.

43:03.048 --> 43:03.980
- Po.

43:03.982 --> 43:07.550
- Oh, I knew it.

43:14.224 --> 43:16.459
- Amelia Carr says that
muskrats are important

43:16.461 --> 43:19.295
to the ecosystem
of north America.

43:19.297 --> 43:21.064
Though minks will eat muskrats,

43:21.066 --> 43:23.099
so be careful, muskrats!

43:23.101 --> 43:27.337
- Po, daddy really needs some
quiet time right now, okay?

43:34.712 --> 43:37.780
- Amelia Carr has
a beautiful voice.

43:39.149 --> 43:44.020
- Po, daddy is very happy that
you have a friend at school.

43:44.022 --> 43:45.688
- She has two daddies.

43:45.690 --> 43:48.992
- I know, but, if you're going
to stay in here right now,

43:48.994 --> 43:50.994
I need you to be quiet.

43:52.730 --> 43:55.431
- Don't be afraid, daddy.

43:55.433 --> 43:57.500
- Be afraid of what, Po?

43:58.402 --> 43:59.502
- Where's mommy?

43:59.504 --> 44:02.005
- Po, I need quiet, right now.

44:02.873 --> 44:03.873
Please.

44:04.975 --> 44:06.542
- Oh, okay, daddy.

44:16.988 --> 44:17.920
Fax machine, daddy!

44:17.922 --> 44:20.390
- Dammit, Po, shut up!

44:20.392 --> 44:21.891
Shut up!

44:21.893 --> 44:24.994
Why can't you understand the
words coming out of my mouth?

44:24.996 --> 44:26.329
Stop talking.

44:26.331 --> 44:29.732
I can't think when you
won't stop talking!

44:32.237 --> 44:33.069
Hey, no.

44:33.071 --> 44:34.504
- No, no!

44:34.506 --> 44:36.272
- Okay, I'm sorry, sorry,
sorry, sorry, buddy.

44:36.274 --> 44:39.242
Sorry, Po, that
was not your fault.

44:39.244 --> 44:40.910
That was not your fault.

44:40.912 --> 44:42.211
Daddy's an idiot.

44:42.213 --> 44:44.313
Okay, daddy's an idiot.

44:55.292 --> 44:59.128
- Amelia Carr can talk
to trees, Amelia Carr.

45:02.733 --> 45:05.301
Amelia Carr can talk to trees.

45:08.839 --> 45:10.940
- You guys really worked
your asses off on this,

45:10.942 --> 45:12.442
and I appreciate it.

45:12.444 --> 45:13.910
And I talked to Randall,

45:13.912 --> 45:15.845
and while you might be shuffled
around between departments,

45:15.847 --> 45:17.313
you're all keeping your jobs.

45:17.315 --> 45:18.748
- What about you?

45:18.750 --> 45:21.050
- Oh, I have the opportunity
to go pursue my dream

45:21.052 --> 45:23.720
of being a medieval blacksmith.

45:25.122 --> 45:28.758
- Okay guys, let's give
this guy some room.

45:33.397 --> 45:35.431
- Hey, thanks for everything.

45:35.433 --> 45:36.833
- Oh, that's it?

45:37.901 --> 45:39.135
You're just going to quit?

45:39.137 --> 45:40.069
- Look, I got fired, man.

45:40.071 --> 45:41.571
What do you want me to do?

45:41.573 --> 45:45.408
- What I don't want you to do
is to give up on this plane.

45:45.410 --> 45:48.878
Come on man, we were this
close, you know that.

45:48.880 --> 45:51.414
- Hey, I'll uh, I'll call you,

45:51.416 --> 45:53.416
maybe we can talk about it.

45:53.418 --> 45:54.418
- Will you?

45:56.153 --> 45:56.986
Please do.

45:56.988 --> 45:57.988
- I will.

45:58.989 --> 46:01.057
- Hey, keep your head up.

46:09.266 --> 46:10.633
- Reuters reports
general electric

46:10.635 --> 46:13.436
is down 12 cents
a share profits.

46:16.406 --> 46:17.573
12 cents, 12.

47:25.142 --> 47:26.142
- Po, Po!

47:29.279 --> 47:30.746
I need your help.

47:36.854 --> 47:39.655
I can't seem to find my horse.

47:39.657 --> 47:42.992
I, uh, I know he's
around here somewhere.

47:42.994 --> 47:47.029
Marshmallow, marshmallow,
where are you?

47:47.031 --> 47:48.931
- Marshmallow, really?

47:50.300 --> 47:51.667
- Yes, why?

47:51.669 --> 47:53.603
You don't like it?

47:53.605 --> 47:56.539
- It's kind of a silly
name for a horse, Jack

47:56.541 --> 48:00.276
- oh, well, someone's
in a bad mood.

48:00.278 --> 48:05.047
- I'm just worried about my
dad, he seems sad all the time.

48:05.049 --> 48:08.084
- Oh well, parents are weird.

48:08.086 --> 48:09.086
Butterfly!

48:13.657 --> 48:15.224
- Okay, good talk.

48:20.664 --> 48:22.498
- My boss got a call today

48:22.500 --> 48:25.001
from your healthcare
provider saying that uh,

48:25.003 --> 48:28.771
they were ending their
service contract with Po.

48:28.773 --> 48:30.640
- What, that's gotta
be some kind of glitch.

48:30.642 --> 48:32.308
- I mean, I could
continue working with him

48:32.310 --> 48:34.744
if you wanted to pay
out of pocket, but...

48:34.746 --> 48:37.413
- I,.

48:37.415 --> 48:39.649
I, I can't, I lost my job.

48:40.984 --> 48:41.851
- I'm sorry, I, uh.

48:41.853 --> 48:42.685
- It's okay.

48:42.687 --> 48:44.553
- But the thing is I,

48:44.555 --> 48:46.722
my company won't let me work
with him without a contract

48:46.724 --> 48:48.491
'cause it's like a liability,
and if he were to get...

48:48.493 --> 48:50.793
- yeah, okay, I
totally understand.

48:50.795 --> 48:52.828
I should have continuing
coverage for 12 months,

48:52.830 --> 48:54.864
so they shouldn't be
canceling anything.

48:54.866 --> 48:55.798
I'll take care of it.

48:55.800 --> 48:57.366
- Okay.

48:57.368 --> 48:58.200
- Watch out!

48:58.202 --> 48:59.202
- Hey.

48:59.971 --> 49:01.270
- Hey, can I get in?

49:01.272 --> 49:03.773
Oh!

49:03.775 --> 49:04.807
- Wrastler.

49:04.809 --> 49:06.309
- Oh!

49:06.311 --> 49:08.711
I'm supposed to have
continuing health coverage

49:08.713 --> 49:11.747
for up to 12 months, or
until I get a new job.

49:11.749 --> 49:13.382
- The coverage
lasts for 12 months,

49:13.384 --> 49:15.451
but that's base services.

49:15.453 --> 49:17.820
Nonessential treatment's
cut after 30 days.

49:17.822 --> 49:18.754
- Nonessential?

49:18.756 --> 49:20.990
It's therapy for his condition.

49:20.992 --> 49:22.525
- It's just not
medically defined.

49:22.527 --> 49:24.393
- It is, it's autism.

49:24.395 --> 49:25.928
He has autism.

49:25.930 --> 49:28.364
- Which is not a qualifying
medical condition

49:28.366 --> 49:29.832
for base level services.

49:29.834 --> 49:32.535
- This is crazy, this is crazy.

49:32.537 --> 49:34.070
You know this is crazy, right?

49:34.072 --> 49:35.972
About one in 70 kids has autism.

49:35.974 --> 49:37.340
Someone you know has autism.

49:37.342 --> 49:38.908
How can this not be covered?

49:38.910 --> 49:42.078
- You can file a formal
complaint, but I must advise you,

49:42.080 --> 49:44.080
the response time is 18 months.

49:44.082 --> 49:48.517
- 18, severance coverage
only lasts 12 months.

49:48.519 --> 49:49.986
- Trust me when I tell you,

49:49.988 --> 49:52.521
you're not the first person
to figure that one out.

49:52.523 --> 49:53.789
- Right.

49:53.791 --> 49:56.192
- If you wish to keep
nonessential services,

49:56.194 --> 50:00.429
you can move on to a monthly
fee-for-service plan.

50:04.768 --> 50:06.302
- Is this a joke?

50:06.304 --> 50:09.038
This is more than out-of-pocket.

50:09.940 --> 50:11.207
Oh, but I'm not the first one

50:11.209 --> 50:13.342
to figure that one
out either, right?

50:13.344 --> 50:16.012
- It's the only option we have.

50:17.781 --> 50:19.315
- Of course it is.

50:43.273 --> 50:45.508
- I wanna play with Amelia Carr.

50:45.510 --> 50:47.243
- We're not going to
do that right now, Po.

50:47.245 --> 50:48.677
We're working on shapes.

50:48.679 --> 50:49.812
- No, Amelia.

50:52.249 --> 50:53.916
Where's Jack?

50:53.918 --> 50:54.918
- Po.

50:56.853 --> 50:57.686
- Come here.

50:57.688 --> 51:00.322
No, hey, Po, calm down.

51:00.324 --> 51:01.824
Po, stop it.

51:01.826 --> 51:03.292
- Toy store.

51:03.294 --> 51:05.795
- No, the toy store's not there
anymore, Po, you know that.

51:05.797 --> 51:07.129
- Let's go to the toy store.

51:07.131 --> 51:09.698
- No, it's not there anymore.

51:09.700 --> 51:10.900
- Where's mommy?

51:10.902 --> 51:12.835
- Stop it, will
you stop it please?

51:12.837 --> 51:16.338
No, no, hey, you
can't take a shoe.

51:16.340 --> 51:18.474
No, you can't touch that.

51:20.043 --> 51:21.243
- Where's mommy?

51:21.245 --> 51:22.878
- Po, come here.

51:22.880 --> 51:23.913
Listen to me.

51:23.915 --> 51:25.414
Stop asking me that.

51:25.416 --> 51:26.649
Mommy's not here.

51:26.651 --> 51:29.385
And she's not coming back, okay?

51:34.958 --> 51:35.958
Po!

51:48.805 --> 51:49.805
Po!

51:54.111 --> 51:55.177
Po, are you?

51:59.349 --> 52:00.349
Hey, Po!

52:02.152 --> 52:03.152
Po!

52:04.821 --> 52:05.821
Po!

52:07.390 --> 52:08.824
Hey, can you help
me find my son?

52:08.826 --> 52:10.626
He's 11 years old,
he has brown hair,

52:10.628 --> 52:13.329
blue stripped shirt,
and jeans, Po!

52:13.331 --> 52:14.830
You guys see a kid with
a blue stripped shirt?

52:14.832 --> 52:16.132
- We have
a code Adam, young boy.

52:16.134 --> 52:17.500
- Po!

52:17.502 --> 52:18.701
Approximately 10 years old,

52:18.703 --> 52:20.336
blue stripped shirt,
any eyes on him?

52:20.338 --> 52:21.303
- How long ago did you lose him?

52:21.305 --> 52:24.173
- I didn't lose him, he ran off,

52:24.175 --> 52:25.608
about 15 minutes.

52:25.610 --> 52:26.809
- Has he been here before?

52:26.811 --> 52:28.344
Is there a certain store
that he likes a lot?

52:28.346 --> 52:30.212
- He likes the toy store,
but it's not here anymore.

52:30.214 --> 52:31.480
I don't know.

52:31.482 --> 52:32.781
- Can you just try and
keep calm, all right?

52:32.783 --> 52:33.883
He's 11, you said?

52:33.885 --> 52:34.817
- Yes.

52:34.819 --> 52:35.751
- He should be just fine.

52:35.753 --> 52:36.685
- No, he, you don't understand.

52:36.687 --> 52:38.420
He gets hurt a lot, he's,

52:38.422 --> 52:40.523
hey, are you just gonna
stand there writing?

52:40.525 --> 52:41.357
You know what?

52:41.359 --> 52:42.359
Forget it.

52:43.427 --> 52:44.427
Po!

52:45.829 --> 52:47.296
Po, where are you?

52:47.298 --> 52:48.298
Po, Po!

52:49.299 --> 52:50.900
- Mr.
Wilson, Mr. Wilson.

52:50.902 --> 52:51.867
- Did you find him?

52:51.869 --> 52:52.701
- Please, just come with me.

52:52.703 --> 52:53.969
- Did you find my son?

52:53.971 --> 52:54.670
- Will you just
come with me, sir?

52:54.672 --> 52:55.672
Thank you.

52:57.374 --> 53:00.142
- No, ouchie, ouchie.

53:00.144 --> 53:01.744
It's a rainbow, daddy.

53:01.746 --> 53:03.012
- Are you okay?

53:03.014 --> 53:04.246
Hey, are you okay?

53:04.248 --> 53:05.414
I'm so sorry, buddy.

53:05.416 --> 53:06.949
- Sir, your son
shoplifted these items

53:06.951 --> 53:07.783
from the store over here.

53:07.785 --> 53:09.018
This is pretty serious.

53:09.020 --> 53:10.119
- Rainbow, daddy.

53:10.121 --> 53:11.353
- Okay, sweetie.

53:11.355 --> 53:14.290
Po, my son, is, he
has some challenges.

53:14.292 --> 53:17.026
He's not a shoplifter,
I swear to you.

53:17.028 --> 53:19.094
He does stuff like this.

53:19.896 --> 53:21.530
- Give me a second.

53:22.599 --> 53:25.134
- Po, you cannot run
away from me like that.

53:25.136 --> 53:26.936
We've talked about
this so many times.

53:26.938 --> 53:28.671
It makes me very upset.

53:28.673 --> 53:30.239
- Don't be sad, daddy.

53:30.241 --> 53:32.675
- I'm not sad, buddy, I'm just,

53:32.677 --> 53:34.476
I don't know what I am.

53:34.478 --> 53:35.678
- Me too.

53:35.680 --> 53:36.612
All right sir,

53:36.614 --> 53:37.947
we've got something worked out.

53:37.949 --> 53:38.781
- Oh, thank you.

53:38.783 --> 53:40.416
Here, stay right here.

53:40.418 --> 53:41.817
- You'll need to make restitution
for the damaged items,

53:41.819 --> 53:43.686
and it's gonna be few
thousand dollars, sir.

53:43.688 --> 53:44.954
- A few?

53:44.956 --> 53:46.622
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

53:46.624 --> 53:47.590
- We have your name and address,

53:47.592 --> 53:50.025
she'll be sending you the bill.

53:50.027 --> 53:52.561
- Uh, okay, okay, thank you.

53:52.563 --> 53:55.197
I'm so sorry about this.

53:55.199 --> 53:56.599
I'll take care of all this.

53:56.601 --> 53:57.866
Thank you for your help.

53:57.868 --> 53:59.134
Come on, let's go.

53:59.136 --> 54:01.870
- Sir, few words of
advice, if I may?

54:02.772 --> 54:04.340
- Okay.

54:04.342 --> 54:06.442
- If I was you, I'd keep
my retarded kid on a leash.

54:06.444 --> 54:09.511
That way he won't
get away from you.

54:12.716 --> 54:14.216
- Time to go, Po.

54:17.687 --> 54:19.588
- My dad's a wrastler.

54:20.790 --> 54:23.859
- You kinda deserved
that, you know.

54:44.648 --> 54:45.648
- Hi.

54:48.918 --> 54:52.054
I just need you to
tell me it's okay.

54:56.192 --> 54:59.595
I don't know how to
move on without you.

55:07.637 --> 55:10.673
- Hey, where you
going off to freak?

55:10.675 --> 55:11.940
I'm talking to you.

55:11.942 --> 55:13.709
- Please, ouchie, ouchie.

55:13.711 --> 55:15.644
- Ouchie, what are you a baby?

55:15.646 --> 55:16.845
- Please.

55:16.847 --> 55:18.947
- You don't run away
from me when I call you.

55:18.949 --> 55:21.450
You get that through
your little bird brain.

55:21.452 --> 55:23.786
- It's a documented fact
that the inferior members

55:23.788 --> 55:27.156
of the species are prone
to aggressive behavior.

55:27.158 --> 55:27.990
- What a freak.

55:27.992 --> 55:29.558
- I'm not a freak!

56:20.710 --> 56:22.378
- Bye, Patrick, Po.

56:27.450 --> 56:28.450
Bye, Po.

56:35.125 --> 56:39.661
- Patrick's school teacher,
myself, the therapy instructors,

56:39.663 --> 56:41.130
we've all become quite concerned

56:41.132 --> 56:43.732
about Po's declining situation.

56:43.734 --> 56:45.000
I need to inform you

56:45.002 --> 56:46.201
that we're going to
be calling a meeting

56:46.203 --> 56:47.903
to recommend Patrick
be transferred

56:47.905 --> 56:49.471
into specialized programming.

56:49.473 --> 56:50.973
- No, you can't do that.

56:50.975 --> 56:52.841
- We need to, Mr. Wilson.

56:52.843 --> 56:55.344
We simply can't provide
what he needs here.

56:55.346 --> 56:58.046
- Right, you mainstream
kids, but the fact is,

56:58.048 --> 57:00.616
you can't really handle kids
outside of the ordinary.

57:00.618 --> 57:02.184
They muck up the works.

57:02.186 --> 57:04.186
They're expensive,
even if they're smart.

57:04.188 --> 57:06.255
They don't score well on
your standardized tests.

57:06.257 --> 57:07.289
Isn't that it?

57:07.291 --> 57:09.124
- Your son is struggling.

57:09.126 --> 57:11.160
And every single one
of us is sick about it.

57:11.162 --> 57:13.796
- Come on, this is a
blip, and you know it.

57:13.798 --> 57:16.298
You know what he's
been going through.

57:16.300 --> 57:17.866
Po is a smart boy.

57:17.868 --> 57:19.868
He could run circles
around most of these kids.

57:19.870 --> 57:22.604
He just does it in his own way.

57:22.606 --> 57:25.240
He's even starting
to make friends, uh,

57:25.242 --> 57:27.676
Amelia, Amelia Carr.

57:27.678 --> 57:30.312
Po has never had a real
friend his own age,

57:30.314 --> 57:33.615
and he can't stop talking
about this girl here at school.

57:33.617 --> 57:34.850
- Amelia?

57:34.852 --> 57:37.419
- Amelia Carr, she
has two daddies.

57:41.257 --> 57:44.593
- Mr. Wilson, we do
not have a student

57:44.595 --> 57:47.429
named Amelia Carr
in this school.

57:49.666 --> 57:51.333
- What are you talking about?

57:51.335 --> 57:54.102
- I know every student
in this school.

57:54.104 --> 57:57.873
Not a single Amelia
anything, I assure you.

57:57.875 --> 57:59.575
- Well that's impossible.

57:59.577 --> 58:00.609
- Excuse me.

58:01.878 --> 58:02.945
- Hi, daddy.

58:10.387 --> 58:11.920
Where's mommy?

58:11.922 --> 58:13.822
- Stop it, Po.

58:14.924 --> 58:17.392
- Patrick's a
nice name for a boy,

58:17.394 --> 58:18.694
but I think I'll call you Po.

58:18.696 --> 58:19.628
- All right, Po.

58:19.630 --> 58:21.530
Hey, Po, calm down, calm down.

58:21.532 --> 58:23.699
- Where's mommy?

58:23.701 --> 58:26.001
- Stop it.

58:26.003 --> 58:27.469
No, hey, give me.

58:28.705 --> 58:30.305
- Where's mommy?

58:30.307 --> 58:31.707
- Po, stop!

58:31.709 --> 58:32.741
- Where's mommy?

58:33.577 --> 58:34.577
- Stop it!

58:36.080 --> 58:37.212
- Uh oh.

58:38.815 --> 58:40.282
- This is for the expired tags.

58:40.284 --> 58:42.384
You'll need to get valid
registration within 30 days,

58:42.386 --> 58:43.852
or the next citation will result

58:43.854 --> 58:46.688
in an impounding
of your vehicle.

58:51.628 --> 58:53.862
What happened to your eye?

58:54.731 --> 58:56.331
- Oh, it was, it was at school.

58:56.333 --> 58:58.600
No, at school,
another kid hit him.

58:58.602 --> 59:00.335
- Another kid hit him?

59:00.337 --> 59:01.837
- Yeah, at school.

59:04.207 --> 59:06.542
- Step out of the car, please.

59:06.544 --> 59:07.709
- Out of the car?

59:07.711 --> 59:08.711
- Yeah.

59:10.413 --> 59:13.382
- Po, stay here,
everything's fine.

59:14.517 --> 59:15.851
Okay.
- Come on.

59:19.289 --> 59:21.456
What happened to his eye?

59:21.458 --> 59:22.958
- Another kid hit him at school.

59:22.960 --> 59:24.159
I told you.

59:24.161 --> 59:26.128
- Hey, where are you guys going?

59:26.130 --> 59:28.730
- Po, get back in the
car, everything's fine.

59:28.732 --> 59:29.732
- You okay?

59:30.600 --> 59:32.234
- It's dinnertime.

59:32.236 --> 59:35.070
- No, buddy, get
back in the car.

59:36.873 --> 59:40.442
- All right, just
forget about the ticket.

59:41.611 --> 59:43.345
- Okay, we're fine?

59:43.347 --> 59:44.479
- We're good.

59:45.582 --> 59:46.415
- Come on, honey,
get in the car.

59:46.417 --> 59:47.549
- Drive safe.

59:55.625 --> 59:58.694
- Hi, I'm trying
to reach bill haze.

01:00:00.396 --> 01:00:01.730
Yes, I'll hold.

01:00:10.206 --> 01:00:12.774
You're gonna love
this place, buddy.

01:00:12.776 --> 01:00:14.276
It's only for a little while,

01:00:14.278 --> 01:00:17.245
and daddy's gonna be there
all the time to see you,

01:00:17.247 --> 01:00:21.249
and they have tons of
fun kids, and guess what?

01:00:21.251 --> 01:00:22.751
They even have
macaroni and cheese.

01:00:22.753 --> 01:00:24.553
Isn't that great, Po?

01:00:33.997 --> 01:00:34.997
Okay, um,

01:00:38.568 --> 01:00:39.568
Po,

01:00:43.740 --> 01:00:47.909
the fact is, daddy's been having
a really hard time lately.

01:00:47.911 --> 01:00:49.745
I don't think I'm
doing a very good job

01:00:49.747 --> 01:00:51.647
of taking care of you,

01:00:53.149 --> 01:00:55.217
and you deserve the best

01:00:58.688 --> 01:01:01.523
because you're a
very special boy.

01:01:05.728 --> 01:01:07.295
Okay, yeah, sorry.

01:01:08.865 --> 01:01:09.865
Sorry.

01:01:30.486 --> 01:01:32.621
- It's a nice place, safe,

01:01:32.623 --> 01:01:35.090
well-equipped to handle
your son's needs.

01:01:35.092 --> 01:01:36.358
- Patrick will be

01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:37.893
well looked after
here, Mr. Wilson,

01:01:37.895 --> 01:01:39.728
we've had a great success rate
with our live-in ABA therapy.

01:01:39.730 --> 01:01:41.997
- Uh, I think I should check
on him just one more time.

01:01:41.999 --> 01:01:46.435
- Mr. Wilson. David, you've
already said goodbye.

01:01:46.437 --> 01:01:47.436
You'll just confuse him.

01:01:47.438 --> 01:01:49.071
Give him some time.

01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:51.540
- Yeah.

01:01:53.543 --> 01:01:56.078
I'm going to be
here all the time.

01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:58.714
- Door's always open.

01:02:03.753 --> 01:02:06.488
- Do me a favor, keep
an eye out for Po.

01:02:06.490 --> 01:02:08.223
He's pretty special.

01:02:09.425 --> 01:02:10.759
- They all are.

01:03:08.417 --> 01:03:11.653
- Uh, wow.

01:03:13.089 --> 01:03:15.791
You do realize that
you're way overqualified

01:03:15.793 --> 01:03:17.359
for this position.

01:03:18.494 --> 01:03:19.861
- What if I promise to
only work hard enough

01:03:19.863 --> 01:03:23.431
to the point of being
perfectly qualified?

01:03:24.267 --> 01:03:26.434
- That's funny, and lazy.

01:03:30.439 --> 01:03:34.709
- Listen, I'm just gonna
be straight with you,

01:03:34.711 --> 01:03:36.378
I have a son with special needs

01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:38.213
who's being cared for right now

01:03:38.215 --> 01:03:41.716
by an agency that will certainly

01:03:41.718 --> 01:03:44.953
and probably unexpectedly
cut off funding.

01:03:44.955 --> 01:03:46.688
It's just how these
things always go.

01:03:46.690 --> 01:03:47.989
So, I need to get both of us

01:03:47.991 --> 01:03:50.258
back onto healthcare
as soon as possible.

01:03:50.260 --> 01:03:52.861
So I will do this job,
I will do it well,

01:03:52.863 --> 01:03:54.329
any way you want to.

01:03:54.331 --> 01:03:56.565
I will never complain
about it being beneath me

01:03:56.567 --> 01:03:58.166
or about it being boring.

01:03:58.168 --> 01:04:00.202
I will be a model employee.

01:04:00.204 --> 01:04:01.403
And everybody,

01:04:03.039 --> 01:04:04.773
everyone will say,

01:04:04.775 --> 01:04:07.909
damn, Randy knows
how to hire people.

01:04:09.579 --> 01:04:11.646
Please, I'm begging you.

01:04:13.449 --> 01:04:16.484
- There's no need to beg, okay.

01:04:16.486 --> 01:04:19.054
I like you, we'll be in touch.

01:04:21.490 --> 01:04:22.557
- Thank you.

01:04:24.994 --> 01:04:26.862
- I'm glad that you called.

01:04:26.864 --> 01:04:30.899
I was um, starting to
wonder about you.

01:04:30.901 --> 01:04:35.637
- I enrolled Po in the
ABA facility in Calabasas.

01:04:35.639 --> 01:04:39.207
- Wow, that must have
been really difficult

01:04:39.209 --> 01:04:40.909
- I feel like a horrible father.

01:04:40.911 --> 01:04:43.044
- No, you're not, you're not.

01:04:43.046 --> 01:04:44.913
You're doing everything
that you can.

01:04:44.915 --> 01:04:45.915
- Am I?

01:04:47.950 --> 01:04:51.519
- This could turn out to be
a really great thing for him.

01:04:51.521 --> 01:04:55.156
And if it's not, then
you can pull him out.

01:04:57.226 --> 01:04:59.594
Oh, here comes one.

01:04:59.596 --> 01:05:01.229
- Look at that, you see
the shape of the wings?

01:05:01.231 --> 01:05:03.932
It converts the forward
thrust into lift.

01:05:03.934 --> 01:05:07.202
It takes 75 tons of
metal off the ground.

01:05:07.204 --> 01:05:09.137
It seems to defy all
the laws of physics,

01:05:09.139 --> 01:05:11.239
but the physics are perfect
which is why it works.

01:05:11.241 --> 01:05:15.110
And now we've got
composite materials.

01:05:15.112 --> 01:05:16.311
- Yeah.

01:05:16.313 --> 01:05:17.679
- New composite
materials, new designs,

01:05:17.681 --> 01:05:18.847
so we can increase the lift

01:05:18.849 --> 01:05:21.750
and reduce the size and weight.

01:05:21.752 --> 01:05:23.652
- How do you know
all of that stuff?

01:05:23.654 --> 01:05:25.387
- It's what I do,
I'm an engineer.

01:05:25.389 --> 01:05:26.389
- Oh.

01:05:27.790 --> 01:05:29.024
- Before I lost my job

01:05:29.026 --> 01:05:31.293
I was working on a
new plane, a hybrid.

01:05:31.295 --> 01:05:32.794
I was designing the airframes,

01:05:32.796 --> 01:05:36.031
the wings and the fuselage,
not the propulsion system.

01:05:36.033 --> 01:05:37.033
Sorry.

01:05:38.201 --> 01:05:40.368
- No, there you go, you
are the first engineer

01:05:40.370 --> 01:05:44.606
who's ever explained
his job to me.

01:05:44.608 --> 01:05:45.874
- Unfortunately, I
don't think it's ever

01:05:45.876 --> 01:05:47.876
getting off the ground.

01:05:48.644 --> 01:05:49.911
- Bad physics?

01:05:49.913 --> 01:05:51.446
- Pretty much.

01:05:51.448 --> 01:05:53.181
I had it in my head.

01:05:53.183 --> 01:05:56.584
I could see it, and
then it disappeared.

01:05:59.121 --> 01:06:01.690
Well, it's just a plane, right?

01:06:03.492 --> 01:06:06.895
- I'm sure it was
more than that.

01:06:06.897 --> 01:06:08.263
- Could've been.

01:06:12.169 --> 01:06:15.804
- Well, I believe that
god grants blessings

01:06:17.506 --> 01:06:19.140
in mysterious ways.

01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:27.549
- Thanks for coming out
here to talk to me, Amy.

01:06:27.551 --> 01:06:29.551
I really appreciate it.

01:06:29.553 --> 01:06:30.618
- Of course.

01:06:49.238 --> 01:06:52.173
- It's highly repetitive,
and it seems so simplistic,

01:06:52.175 --> 01:06:54.809
but we perform these behavioral
routines for several hours

01:06:54.811 --> 01:06:57.979
every day until
they become routine.

01:06:57.981 --> 01:07:00.915
Now the kids are rewarded
for their successes

01:07:00.917 --> 01:07:02.117
mostly in the form of stickers

01:07:02.119 --> 01:07:04.719
that we have here
for goodies and toys.

01:07:04.721 --> 01:07:06.721
And we do this
with social skills,

01:07:06.723 --> 01:07:10.458
academics, self-care and
hygiene, and motor functions.

01:07:10.460 --> 01:07:11.292
- What does it really change?

01:07:11.294 --> 01:07:12.494
At the end of the day,

01:07:12.496 --> 01:07:14.929
they're still the
same basic kid, right?

01:07:14.931 --> 01:07:17.832
- Well, here's something
most men understand.

01:07:17.834 --> 01:07:22.737
Now, imagine that you're horrible
at, let's say, basketball,

01:07:22.739 --> 01:07:27.242
just born without the height,
the speed, the coordination.

01:07:27.244 --> 01:07:28.910
But let's say, from
a very early age,

01:07:28.912 --> 01:07:31.579
you're out there with a
coach, every day, for hours

01:07:31.581 --> 01:07:35.016
working on basic
skills, over and over.

01:07:35.018 --> 01:07:38.586
Free throws, set shot,
three-pointer, over and over again,

01:07:38.588 --> 01:07:41.289
training your body
to make these shots.

01:07:41.291 --> 01:07:42.824
Now, through repetition,

01:07:42.826 --> 01:07:44.225
even the most unblessed athlete

01:07:44.227 --> 01:07:47.495
would be reasonably
proficient at these skills.

01:07:47.497 --> 01:07:49.764
And then no, you
don't make the NBA,

01:07:49.766 --> 01:07:53.468
but maybe you make
your high school team,

01:07:53.470 --> 01:07:54.836
and that's not bad.

01:07:54.838 --> 01:07:56.471
- He looks pale to me.

01:07:56.473 --> 01:07:58.073
- Well on that front,
you can rest assured

01:07:58.075 --> 01:08:00.308
that every kid here is getting
three solid meals a day,

01:08:00.310 --> 01:08:04.679
plenty of rest, and medical
attention whenever needed.

01:08:04.681 --> 01:08:05.914
- Sounds like,

01:08:07.283 --> 01:08:11.519
I'll be back
on Thursday, thank you.

01:08:13.856 --> 01:08:14.856
Hey, Po.

01:08:17.426 --> 01:08:19.493
Uh, I have to go to work.

01:08:19.496 --> 01:08:22.229
But I'll be back on
Thursday, okay buddy?

01:08:22.232 --> 01:08:24.064
- Don't be afraid, daddy.

01:08:29.638 --> 01:08:31.973
- I'll be back on Thursday.

01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:46.754
- Do you think
you're ready to come with me?

01:08:46.756 --> 01:08:48.790
- No, not yet.

01:08:48.792 --> 01:08:51.158
- Okay, you let
me know when you're ready.

01:08:51.161 --> 01:08:52.393
- I will.

01:08:55.163 --> 01:08:56.331
- Oh, it's not broken.

01:08:56.332 --> 01:08:57.899
You just had the blades
on the wrong way.

01:08:57.901 --> 01:09:00.835
These are fixed-pitch propellers,
so two spin clockwise,

01:09:00.837 --> 01:09:02.904
the other two spin
counterclockwise.

01:09:02.906 --> 01:09:04.139
- Cool.

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:06.573
- Now by precisely and
accurately spinning

01:09:06.576 --> 01:09:08.943
these four propellers
at different speeds,

01:09:08.944 --> 01:09:10.879
all the common
directional movements

01:09:10.881 --> 01:09:14.282
of the standard
helicopter are attained.

01:09:15.917 --> 01:09:16.751
- Wow.

01:09:16.752 --> 01:09:17.585
- There you go.

01:09:17.587 --> 01:09:19.520
- Thank you so, so much.

01:09:19.523 --> 01:09:20.523
- Anytime.

01:09:23.126 --> 01:09:24.692
- Thank you.

01:09:27.796 --> 01:09:28.796
- Now you.

01:09:29.832 --> 01:09:32.066
- So this is where
they hide genius.

01:09:32.068 --> 01:09:33.068
- Hey, man.

01:09:34.403 --> 01:09:36.304
- You've been thinking about
our plane, haven't you?

01:09:36.305 --> 01:09:37.604
- I can't stop.

01:09:38.741 --> 01:09:39.741
Thank you.

01:09:41.277 --> 01:09:42.877
- Nice digs you got here.

01:09:42.879 --> 01:09:46.180
- Well, they've got
a real health plan.

01:09:47.249 --> 01:09:48.716
Listen, hey, thanks
for the coffee.

01:09:48.718 --> 01:09:49.651
I gotta get back to work.

01:09:49.653 --> 01:09:51.786
- They've got you on boss watch?

01:09:51.787 --> 01:09:54.422
Serious, do they not
understand who you are?

01:09:54.424 --> 01:09:55.256
Should I tell them?

01:09:55.258 --> 01:09:56.724
- Please don't.

01:09:56.726 --> 01:09:58.426
- All right, well listen,
I've been doing some thinking,

01:09:58.428 --> 01:10:01.329
and I think that what
you need is a woman.

01:10:01.331 --> 01:10:02.564
Wait, hear me out.

01:10:02.566 --> 01:10:04.532
What we're gonna do
is we're gonna go out,

01:10:04.534 --> 01:10:05.700
we're gonna get some drinks,

01:10:05.702 --> 01:10:06.868
we're gonna meet
some nice girls.

01:10:06.870 --> 01:10:08.803
We drive to Vegas.

01:10:08.805 --> 01:10:10.872
- I can't, I can't.

01:10:10.874 --> 01:10:14.609
I, uh, I've kind of
started seeing somebody.

01:10:16.278 --> 01:10:18.846
- Wow, I'm happy for you, man.

01:10:23.485 --> 01:10:25.720
I'm, all right, all right.

01:10:28.524 --> 01:10:31.659
My boy David is
getting some, people!

01:10:33.329 --> 01:10:34.329
- Really?

01:10:35.764 --> 01:10:37.632
- You are a good
man, David Wilson.

01:10:37.634 --> 01:10:39.667
- Have a nice day,
total stranger.

01:10:43.639 --> 01:10:44.706
- Woo!

01:11:16.939 --> 01:11:18.740
- That's amazing.

01:11:18.742 --> 01:11:21.009
- And if you board
this ship, Po,

01:11:21.011 --> 01:11:23.778
you can live here forever.

01:11:23.780 --> 01:11:26.180
- Are they lost children too?

01:11:26.182 --> 01:11:28.816
- Oh no, not lost, in movement.

01:11:30.586 --> 01:11:33.921
You see all beings exist
on multiple planes.

01:11:33.923 --> 01:11:36.824
But most can only perceive
the one that they're on.

01:11:36.826 --> 01:11:40.361
They're unable, or
unwilling to see the others.

01:11:40.363 --> 01:11:42.864
But some children,
have the ability

01:11:42.866 --> 01:11:45.533
to tune into other frequencies.

01:11:46.769 --> 01:11:49.370
That's why you appear
tuned out in their world

01:11:49.372 --> 01:11:52.573
because you're moving
between places, Po.

01:11:52.575 --> 01:11:54.842
Well, they don't understand it,

01:11:54.844 --> 01:11:56.778
so they give it simple names,

01:11:56.780 --> 01:11:59.681
refer to it as a
medical condition.

01:11:59.683 --> 01:12:03.518
But the children here
are from the world over.

01:12:06.755 --> 01:12:09.157
- This is all so incredible.

01:12:09.159 --> 01:12:12.160
- Oh, Po, this is
just one channel.

01:12:13.629 --> 01:12:15.930
The places your
mind will take you,

01:12:15.932 --> 01:12:20.168
I can't even begin to imagine.

01:13:04.313 --> 01:13:05.747
- Has he been eating?

01:13:05.749 --> 01:13:07.749
- It's been a struggle.

01:13:14.690 --> 01:13:15.690
- Po.

01:13:17.226 --> 01:13:18.226
Po.

01:13:19.228 --> 01:13:21.429
- Patrick's a nice
name for a boy.

01:13:21.431 --> 01:13:23.564
- Do you remember me, Po?

01:13:24.633 --> 01:13:26.834
- Amelia Carr can talk to trees.

01:13:26.836 --> 01:13:28.169
- It's Amy, Po.

01:13:29.571 --> 01:13:31.205
- Jack's my friend.

01:13:40.349 --> 01:13:43.184
- I'd really like to be put
in the loop on his report.

01:13:43.186 --> 01:13:44.585
- I do appreciate your concern,

01:13:44.587 --> 01:13:45.853
but that's really
just limited to...

01:13:45.855 --> 01:13:46.855
- please.

01:13:49.224 --> 01:13:50.958
- I'll list you as family.

01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:52.026
- Thank you.

01:14:06.041 --> 01:14:09.343
Mm, you're right, this
is a great Pb and j.

01:14:09.345 --> 01:14:10.345
- I told you.

01:14:13.715 --> 01:14:15.850
- Um, I saw Po yesterday.

01:14:17.719 --> 01:14:20.188
- At shoreline, why?

01:14:20.190 --> 01:14:21.489
- I missed him.

01:14:23.392 --> 01:14:26.561
- I wish you would've
asked me first.

01:14:27.663 --> 01:14:31.833
- I'm sorry, I was just,
um, worried about him.

01:14:31.835 --> 01:14:35.203
- Yeah, I'm worried
about him too,

01:14:35.205 --> 01:14:36.571
but I didn't have a choice

01:14:36.573 --> 01:14:39.307
'cause his school's
pushing him out,

01:14:39.309 --> 01:14:42.743
and the whole insurance
screw up, and my job,

01:14:42.745 --> 01:14:45.046
and I don't have any money,

01:14:46.148 --> 01:14:48.282
so I can't take care of him.

01:14:48.284 --> 01:14:51.452
Bill was right, I let
my ego get in the way.

01:14:51.454 --> 01:14:52.286
I did it with my job.

01:14:52.288 --> 01:14:53.621
I did it with Po.

01:14:53.623 --> 01:14:56.591
- Do you ever wonder
why Po drifts?

01:14:57.659 --> 01:14:59.827
- Do I wonder why he drifts?

01:14:59.829 --> 01:15:01.229
Yeah, yeah, I do.

01:15:02.297 --> 01:15:03.231
I wonder why he drifts.

01:15:03.233 --> 01:15:05.099
I wonder why he flaps his arms.

01:15:05.101 --> 01:15:06.567
I wonder why he won't eat.

01:15:06.569 --> 01:15:09.704
I wonder if he'll ever
learn how to tie his shoes,

01:15:09.706 --> 01:15:12.573
or get a girlfriend,
or get married, yeah.

01:15:12.575 --> 01:15:14.275
I wonder a lot.

01:15:14.277 --> 01:15:15.776
- Well, when I was there,

01:15:15.778 --> 01:15:19.080
they told me that you hadn't
seen I'm in a couple of days.

01:15:19.082 --> 01:15:20.882
- They told you that?

01:15:22.251 --> 01:15:24.785
I've been working double
shifts at a hobby shop,

01:15:24.787 --> 01:15:26.020
so we don't lose our house.

01:15:26.022 --> 01:15:27.255
Did they tell you that?

01:15:27.257 --> 01:15:30.625
- I just think that
when you get the time,

01:15:30.627 --> 01:15:32.393
you should probably go see him.

01:15:32.395 --> 01:15:33.427
- Where's this coming from?

01:15:33.429 --> 01:15:34.595
Why are you on my case?

01:15:34.597 --> 01:15:35.730
You're not his mom.

01:15:35.732 --> 01:15:38.499
- You're right, I'm not his mom.

01:15:41.370 --> 01:15:43.037
But you're his dad.

01:15:44.439 --> 01:15:48.209
Do not let him drift away
'til there's nothing left.

01:15:48.211 --> 01:15:50.177
I'm only trying to help.

01:15:50.179 --> 01:15:53.648
- Well, I didn't
ask for your help.

01:15:53.650 --> 01:15:54.982
- You're right.

01:16:57.646 --> 01:16:59.080
- David.

01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:01.950
- Beth.

01:17:05.654 --> 01:17:08.889
- I thought I'd sleep
in here tonight.

01:17:10.659 --> 01:17:12.460
- I miss you so much.

01:17:14.363 --> 01:17:16.163
- Is Po okay?

01:17:16.165 --> 01:17:17.565
- Po?

01:17:17.567 --> 01:17:19.367
- Didn't you just
go check on him?

01:17:19.369 --> 01:17:21.602
I thought I heard him cry.

01:17:21.604 --> 01:17:23.404
- Yeah, yeah, I just,

01:17:27.809 --> 01:17:29.043
I can't do this alone.

01:17:29.045 --> 01:17:30.978
I need you here.

01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:32.647
- You've done real well.

01:17:32.649 --> 01:17:34.382
You'll do just fine.

01:17:35.717 --> 01:17:37.685
Don't be afraid, David.

01:18:02.544 --> 01:18:03.711
- Hello.

01:18:03.713 --> 01:18:04.979
- Mr.
Wilson, you're son Po

01:18:04.981 --> 01:18:06.981
has gone missing from shoreline.

01:18:06.983 --> 01:18:09.350
Please come to the facility
as soon as you can.

01:18:13.489 --> 01:18:14.755
- Bill, where is he?

01:18:14.757 --> 01:18:15.990
- David, I'm really sorry,

01:18:15.992 --> 01:18:17.224
but we have no idea where...

01:18:17.226 --> 01:18:18.492
- we searched the
entire facility.

01:18:18.494 --> 01:18:20.261
He's definitely not
inside the building.

01:18:20.263 --> 01:18:22.329
- I assure you, this has
never happened before.

01:18:22.331 --> 01:18:24.031
- You have surveillance
cameras on the property?

01:18:24.033 --> 01:18:25.232
- Yeah, we do.

01:18:25.234 --> 01:18:26.801
It's DVR inside the
administration's office.

01:18:26.803 --> 01:18:28.903
- Great, now you wanna
tell me how you lose a kid?

01:18:28.905 --> 01:18:30.137
- We will find
him, I promise you.

01:18:30.139 --> 01:18:31.405
- -Yeah, bill this is
your responsibility!

01:18:31.407 --> 01:18:32.239
- David, calm down.

01:18:32.241 --> 01:18:33.407
- Don't you tell me...

01:18:33.409 --> 01:18:35.109
- sir, we have a
witness who saw a boy

01:18:35.111 --> 01:18:36.610
that matches the description,

01:18:36.612 --> 01:18:39.613
who got into a cab here on
this street about an hour ago.

01:18:39.615 --> 01:18:41.115
What we don't have

01:18:41.117 --> 01:18:42.616
is the name of the taxi
company or license plate.

01:18:42.618 --> 01:18:44.118
- Oh, god.

01:18:44.120 --> 01:18:48.522
- Do you have any idea where
your son might take a cab?

01:18:48.524 --> 01:18:49.724
- Yes.

01:19:38.173 --> 01:19:39.173
Po!

01:19:40.342 --> 01:19:41.342
Po.

01:19:42.744 --> 01:19:43.744
Po.

01:19:49.084 --> 01:19:50.818
Po, can you hear me?

01:19:54.823 --> 01:19:57.424
- Come on, are you ready?

01:19:57.426 --> 01:19:59.226
- Once I get on the rocket ship,

01:19:59.228 --> 01:20:01.762
there's no coming back, right?

01:20:01.764 --> 01:20:06.767
- We exist on many planes,
but we can only live on one.

01:20:06.769 --> 01:20:08.702
I know you'll make
the right choice, Po.

01:20:08.704 --> 01:20:11.839
- Don't you leave
me, you understand?

01:20:13.909 --> 01:20:16.410
I am not going to let you go.

01:20:17.679 --> 01:20:19.380
- I'm ready.

01:20:19.382 --> 01:20:20.714
- I'm glad, Po.

01:20:22.484 --> 01:20:23.617
- Po, please.

01:20:24.986 --> 01:20:25.986
Po.

01:20:27.455 --> 01:20:29.190
Po, can you hear me?

01:20:30.859 --> 01:20:32.193
Come on, buddy.

01:20:34.062 --> 01:20:37.331
Po, Po, please come
back to me, buddy.

01:20:49.311 --> 01:20:50.311
Hey, Po.

01:20:54.482 --> 01:20:55.482
Po.

01:20:58.486 --> 01:21:00.955
- Don't be afraid daddy.

01:21:00.957 --> 01:21:05.159
- Don't be afraid of what, pal?

01:21:05.161 --> 01:21:07.228
- Don't be afraid of me.

01:21:08.363 --> 01:21:11.365
I don't want people
to be afraid of me.

01:21:12.634 --> 01:21:15.736
Don't be afraid of me, daddy.

01:21:15.738 --> 01:21:18.205
- I'm not afraid of you.

01:21:18.207 --> 01:21:20.941
Daddy's not afraid, not anymore.

01:21:23.311 --> 01:21:24.712
- Where's mommy?

01:21:33.388 --> 01:21:34.855
- Po, mommy died,

01:21:41.930 --> 01:21:46.500
and I didn't take you
to the funeral because,

01:21:46.502 --> 01:21:48.636
I was wrong, I was wrong.

01:21:50.305 --> 01:21:52.239
And you didn't get a
chance to say goodbye,

01:21:52.241 --> 01:21:53.807
and I am so sorry.

01:21:55.944 --> 01:22:00.414
You listen to me, Po,
your mommy is in heaven,

01:22:00.416 --> 01:22:02.650
and she is dancing with angels.

01:22:02.652 --> 01:22:03.751
She's fine.

01:22:03.753 --> 01:22:04.585
You hear me?

01:22:04.587 --> 01:22:06.887
Your mommy's fine.

01:22:06.889 --> 01:22:07.889
- I know.

01:22:10.191 --> 01:22:11.759
I miss her, daddy.

01:22:16.731 --> 01:22:19.400
- I miss her too, buddy.

01:22:19.402 --> 01:22:20.834
I miss her too.

01:22:33.348 --> 01:22:34.748
Let's go, buddy.

01:22:55.036 --> 01:22:56.704
- In light of all
of our meetings

01:22:56.706 --> 01:22:58.605
with Po over the past few days,

01:22:58.607 --> 01:23:00.307
and with a new, rather detailed

01:23:00.309 --> 01:23:02.276
plan of attack from Po's father,

01:23:02.278 --> 01:23:06.513
we've decided to have Po back
at Parker elementary school.

01:23:06.515 --> 01:23:09.750
And thanks to Jack
and his watchful eyes,

01:23:09.752 --> 01:23:13.153
Taylor march has been
expelled for bullying.

01:23:13.155 --> 01:23:17.391
I'm so sorry we didn't catch
this sooner, Mr. Wilson.

01:23:17.393 --> 01:23:18.959
- Thank you, Jack.

01:23:23.398 --> 01:23:24.865
- Natural selection
is the theory

01:23:24.867 --> 01:23:27.968
of plant and animal
adaptation first introduced

01:23:27.970 --> 01:23:30.204
by Charles Darwin in 1859.

01:23:32.207 --> 01:23:33.440
Not that you would notice,

01:23:33.442 --> 01:23:35.242
but I've moved on
to the letter n.

01:23:35.244 --> 01:23:36.744
- Natural selection
is the theory

01:23:36.746 --> 01:23:39.246
by which organisms with
more favorable traits

01:23:39.248 --> 01:23:41.515
are more likely to survive.

01:23:41.517 --> 01:23:44.752
- Po Wilson, you've
been borrowing my book

01:23:44.754 --> 01:23:46.687
without my permission.

01:23:46.689 --> 01:23:47.689
- Yeah.

01:23:54.096 --> 01:23:56.497
- I'm afraid it's that time.

01:24:12.747 --> 01:24:16.717
Over time you'll forget
about me more and more.

01:24:20.655 --> 01:24:22.723
We'll still be with you,

01:24:25.427 --> 01:24:28.929
as will your mother,
and all of the others

01:24:28.931 --> 01:24:30.664
looking out for you.

01:24:38.940 --> 01:24:40.574
Always and forever.

01:25:11.940 --> 01:25:13.006
- All right.

01:25:23.051 --> 01:25:24.518
What do ya think?

01:25:27.889 --> 01:25:29.690
- It's a rainbow, daddy!

01:25:29.692 --> 01:25:31.625
- Yeah, is there a rainbow?

01:25:31.627 --> 01:25:32.627
- Rainbow!

01:25:40.335 --> 01:25:41.335
- Rainbow.

01:25:44.139 --> 01:25:45.139
- Rainbow.

01:25:51.579 --> 01:25:55.816
- It's the rainbow!

01:25:55.818 --> 01:25:58.519
Of course, it's a rainbow!

01:25:58.521 --> 01:25:59.920
You're a genius!

01:26:02.357 --> 01:26:03.557
- I told you.

01:26:03.559 --> 01:26:04.391
- You told me.

01:26:04.393 --> 01:26:05.425
- A rainbow.

01:26:05.427 --> 01:26:07.127
- Yes, you did.

01:26:07.129 --> 01:26:08.428
- Rainbow.
- High five.

01:26:13.401 --> 01:26:14.401
It flies.

01:26:15.403 --> 01:26:18.205
My son calls it
the rainbow wing.

01:26:18.207 --> 01:26:20.674
It increases lift by 80%.

01:26:20.676 --> 01:26:23.443
This design will change
the way you and I fly

01:26:23.445 --> 01:26:25.946
for the rest of our lives.

01:26:25.948 --> 01:26:26.948
- My god!

01:26:28.550 --> 01:26:29.716
- And you're sure it flies?

01:26:29.718 --> 01:26:32.719
- Oh, yeah, it
flies, we tested it.

01:26:32.721 --> 01:26:35.989
You can do a full-scale
test as early as next month.

01:26:35.991 --> 01:26:38.926
- That is the plan
I promised you.

01:26:38.928 --> 01:26:40.827
- Good job, David.

01:26:40.829 --> 01:26:43.297
- Thanks, oh, one more thing,

01:26:44.599 --> 01:26:45.999
I quit.

01:26:46.001 --> 01:26:47.234
- Excuse me?

01:26:47.236 --> 01:26:49.536
- Uh, he just gets excited.

01:26:50.405 --> 01:26:52.306
- Thank you, Peggy.

01:26:52.308 --> 01:26:53.273
- Wait, wait.

01:26:53.275 --> 01:26:56.176
Are, are you seriously quitting?

01:26:56.178 --> 01:26:59.413
- David, at least you gotta
come back and work here.

01:26:59.415 --> 01:27:01.181
- No, I'm handing the
project over to Ben.

01:27:01.183 --> 01:27:03.984
He is the second
smartest guy you've got.

01:27:03.986 --> 01:27:05.118
- That's funny.

01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:06.954
- What are you gonna do?

01:27:06.956 --> 01:27:09.022
- Well, I might come if you
get your healthcare sorted out,

01:27:09.024 --> 01:27:10.958
but until then, I'm gonna
take a little break,

01:27:10.960 --> 01:27:13.694
and spend some time with my son.

01:27:20.301 --> 01:27:21.802
- It's unusual for
someone your age

01:27:21.804 --> 01:27:24.871
to clear out their 401.

01:27:24.873 --> 01:27:28.108
- Well, I'm unusual,
and so is my son.

01:27:29.210 --> 01:27:30.043
And I wanna take a
couple of months off

01:27:30.045 --> 01:27:32.045
without losing my house.

01:27:32.047 --> 01:27:33.280
- Are you sure you
don't wanna keep

01:27:33.282 --> 01:27:35.315
a couple long-term positions?

01:27:35.317 --> 01:27:39.253
This is rather a large
amount to take in cash.

01:27:39.255 --> 01:27:40.654
- I don't know if
I'd call it large,

01:27:40.656 --> 01:27:42.956
but if my paycheck
contributions haven't added up

01:27:42.958 --> 01:27:46.326
to at least 20k, I'm
calling the cops.

01:27:46.328 --> 01:27:50.731
- Mr. Wilson, you have over
$400,000 in your account.

01:27:50.733 --> 01:27:51.965
- What?

01:27:51.967 --> 01:27:53.433
- I admit, some
of the stock picks

01:27:53.435 --> 01:27:56.870
were rather risky, but they
did pay off quite well.

01:27:56.872 --> 01:27:59.539
- Uh, I haven't made
any stock picks.

01:27:59.541 --> 01:28:02.242
- Well, I assume that these
are your order sheets.

01:28:02.244 --> 01:28:04.011
We've been receiving the faxes.

01:28:04.013 --> 01:28:07.414
This is your verified
signature on them.

01:28:10.151 --> 01:28:12.286
- Autograph, please.

01:28:14.989 --> 01:28:16.156
- Of course, if you'd like

01:28:16.158 --> 01:28:17.591
to question the funds
in your account.

01:28:17.593 --> 01:28:19.393
- Check, please.

01:28:19.395 --> 01:28:20.395
- Yes, sir.

01:28:21.863 --> 01:28:24.431
- Mac and cheese!

01:28:27.635 --> 01:28:29.036
- Mm, it's good.

01:28:30.538 --> 01:28:32.639
- She's pretty, daddy.

01:28:32.641 --> 01:28:34.708
- She's very pretty, Po.

01:28:36.277 --> 01:28:38.545
- You boys are too sweet.

01:28:38.547 --> 01:28:39.780
Oh, I was going to
give you something.

01:28:39.782 --> 01:28:41.515
I know that it's not
your birthday yet,

01:28:41.517 --> 01:28:44.451
but I want you to open it.

01:28:44.453 --> 01:28:45.552
- What did you do?

01:28:45.554 --> 01:28:46.720
- You'll see.

01:28:48.923 --> 01:28:50.090
- Wow, wow, wow!

01:28:50.092 --> 01:28:51.092
What is it?

01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:53.427
- Billy idol tickets?

01:28:53.429 --> 01:28:55.862
- Billy idol, Billy
idol, Billy idol,

01:28:55.864 --> 01:28:57.831
Billy idol, Billy idol!

01:29:20.855 --> 01:29:21.855
Hi, mom.

01:29:28.663 --> 01:29:30.797
I have something for you.
