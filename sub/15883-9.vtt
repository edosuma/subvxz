- That was racist.

08:41.837 --> 08:44.739
- Yeah, that's racist.
- Ooh, that is racist.

08:44.907 --> 08:46.171
That's racist?

08:46.534 --> 08:49.413
Oh, see, okay,
nope, forget it.

08:49.445 --> 08:51.412
Black Falcon out...
Green Falcon!

08:51.430 --> 08:54.165
(whoosh)
Green Falcon! Damn it!

08:54.540 --> 08:57.744
Hey! Why'd that Green Falcon
fall out of Falcon formation?

08:57.763 --> 09:00.297
Black Falcon,
get on that and report back.

09:00.614 --> 09:03.409
Black Falcon?
Black Falcon, come in.

09:09.640 --> 09:13.176
You know what's ridiculous?
When people go to prison

09:13.394 --> 09:15.592
because they... they're trying
to cover for somebody else.

09:15.642 --> 09:17.076
- Yeah.
- Don't go to prison.

09:17.194 --> 09:19.729
If you... if you do...
if you didn't do the crime...

09:20.051 --> 09:22.185
Both: Don't do the time.

09:22.228 --> 09:23.253
It's true.

09:23.299 --> 09:25.941
And that's one to grow on.
(laughter)

09:27.801 --> 09:29.669
But, you know,
in prison they, you know...

09:29.736 --> 09:31.203
It's not worth anything.

09:31.271 --> 09:32.939
- No, it's not.
- It's not worth anything

09:33.006 --> 09:35.741
to just straight-up
get manhandled, and horseplayed,

09:35.809 --> 09:38.377
and monkeyed around.
No, you don't want any...

09:38.445 --> 09:40.145
- Eh, yeah, no.
- You don't want to have

09:40.160 --> 09:43.516
animal interactions
with another man behind bars.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.060
I don't want
any rascally behavior.

09:45.082 --> 09:46.456
- I don't need...
- You don't want...

09:46.472 --> 09:48.821
everybody's undying respect
when I get out is not worth it.

09:48.889 --> 09:50.290
- No, and as a matter of fact...
- I don't care.

09:50.361 --> 09:52.061
you might not get
that undying respect...

09:52.076 --> 09:53.960
- Respect, yes.
- If, you know...

09:54.309 --> 09:56.696
when you fart it goes...
wooh... like a bottle.

09:56.763 --> 09:57.830
(laughter)
like a bottle.

09:57.898 --> 09:59.765

10:03.403 --> 10:04.776
I'm sorry.

(laughter)

10:13.840 --> 10:16.549
Ma'am...
Breathe.

10:24.636 --> 10:26.759
Yo, man, you okay in here?

10:26.827 --> 10:29.228
Everyone on the outside
know you didn't talk.

10:29.296 --> 10:31.364
We got mad respect
for you, dog.

10:31.431 --> 10:33.167
All right?
Mad respect.

10:34.214 --> 10:35.301
Yes.

10:35.496 --> 10:38.914
And I am still happy
with that decision.

10:39.663 --> 10:41.125
The first time
I was in lockup,

10:41.901 --> 10:44.389
dog, I was scared
[bleep]less, man.

10:44.481 --> 10:47.113
Scared [bleep]less, yes.
That is an...

10:47.180 --> 10:48.881
accurate way
to describe it.

10:48.949 --> 10:50.416
Yeah, man, but, you know,

10:50.484 --> 10:52.827
it wasn't too long before
I made this place my bitch.

10:52.866 --> 10:56.455
Oh, eh, there's plenty
of that going on.

10:56.523 --> 10:58.090
Yo, I ran this place, man.

10:58.158 --> 11:00.526
Come on, man, you must be
running this [bleep]hole.

11:00.594 --> 11:03.429
(laughs) Well, I am doing
quite a bit of running.

11:03.472 --> 11:05.789
Man, you know there's a
certain pecking order in prison.

11:05.854 --> 11:07.579
You know, you got
the brothers on the top,

11:07.642 --> 11:09.343
and you got the brothers
on the bottom.

11:09.601 --> 11:10.635
You understand.

11:10.652 --> 11:13.220
Yes, I understand that
very clearly

11:13.240 --> 11:14.807
and very frequently.

11:15.307 --> 11:16.662
That's my dog.

11:18.049 --> 11:19.146
Now...

11:19.215 --> 11:23.020
the reason I came, though,
is we got kind of a problem.

11:24.900 --> 11:27.568
You know a crazy brother in here
go by the name of "Seven Inch"?

11:27.636 --> 11:30.438
Yes.
I definitely know Seven Inch.

11:30.505 --> 11:31.939
All right,
well Seven Inch run

11:31.956 --> 11:33.890
with the Willis brothers,
all right?

11:33.907 --> 11:35.416
And he knows
some [bleep] that...

11:36.127 --> 11:38.466
Well, let's just say we can't
have this guy naming names.

11:38.491 --> 11:39.728
All right?

11:41.022 --> 11:42.841
We thought since you
on the inside,

11:42.907 --> 11:44.341
you could take care of it.

11:44.875 --> 11:46.210
You know what
I'm talking about?

11:46.277 --> 11:48.288
You want me
to take care of Seven Inch?

11:48.384 --> 11:50.369
Yeah, you know,
just take him out the equation.

11:50.536 --> 11:53.045
The problem is
getting time with him.

11:53.113 --> 11:54.828
Oh, I can get time
with him.

11:55.687 --> 11:58.173
Oh, yes, I do believe
I will most likely

11:58.210 --> 11:59.658
be seeing him this evening.

11:59.695 --> 12:00.930
That's awesome.

12:01.050 --> 12:02.825
Okay, but you...
you gotta get him alone, though.

12:02.851 --> 12:05.935
Ohhh...
That won't be a problem.

12:05.984 --> 12:07.051
Okay, well, uh...

12:07.264 --> 12:09.187
What's your plan, man?
How you gonna do it?

12:09.395 --> 12:11.933
What do you say
I bite his [bleep] off?

12:12.632 --> 12:13.883
Excuse me?

12:14.588 --> 12:18.396
Just bring my teeth down hard
on his [bleep].

12:19.588 --> 12:21.455
Dog, how you...
how you gonna get that close?

12:21.923 --> 12:24.866
Just...Way ahead of you
on that one.

12:26.052 --> 12:27.246
(laughs)

12:27.314 --> 12:30.429
Oh, man.
You bad, man.

12:30.568 --> 12:32.969
That's... that's some
hard [bleep], dog.

12:33.088 --> 12:35.361
This place
has changed you, man.

12:37.146 --> 12:38.612
You have no idea.

12:43.230 --> 12:45.094
(exhales sharply)

13:03.099 --> 13:05.067
(soul music)

13:05.644 --> 13:07.745
- I'm scared of cops.
- You're scared of cops?

13:07.813 --> 13:09.113
I'm scared of cops.

13:09.201 --> 13:11.461
I-I mean, I'm generally
afraid of cops because

13:11.461 --> 13:13.621
when I walk around with, like,
a black friend,

13:13.734 --> 13:14.752
like you...

13:15.352 --> 13:17.454
(laughter)

13:17.522 --> 13:20.109
I start... I start talking
a little bit more thug

13:20.115 --> 13:21.463
- 'cause, you know...
- No, I know.

13:21.496 --> 13:23.513
- We nee... yeah.
- Because we need the extra power.

13:23.532 --> 13:25.933
- We need this.
- To make one full black person.

13:26.022 --> 13:27.956
- We need this.
- So, you know. (laughter)

13:29.325 --> 13:30.587
It's gotta be right about

13:30.602 --> 13:31.736
- this level right...
- I swear to God...

13:31.778 --> 13:32.578
But you know what I'm saying,
brother?

13:32.620 --> 13:33.640
You know what I'm saying?

13:33.689 --> 13:35.059
Didn't you just get more
comfortable all of a sudden?

13:35.069 --> 13:36.844
Yeah, all right.
(laughter, applause)

13:37.378 --> 13:40.686
So, but a cop... if a cop
comes up to me on the street and,

13:40.703 --> 13:41.735
"Hey, what are you guys doing?"

13:41.751 --> 13:43.526
I-I turn into [bleep]
Ned Flanders.

13:43.574 --> 13:45.232
It's all, "Hi-dee-oh.

13:45.445 --> 13:47.103
"Doing just fine.
Just walking down the street

13:47.146 --> 13:48.752
"on a stroll, my friend.

13:48.820 --> 13:50.321
"Come on, follow me.

13:51.022 --> 13:53.321
"We'll find some criminals
together, let's do it."

13:53.385 --> 13:54.458
Oh, man.

13:54.526 --> 13:56.278
- "I'll tell on anyone."
- So...

13:56.387 --> 13:57.728
"I'll tell on..."
(laughs)

14:03.071 --> 14:06.303
(indistinct radio chatter)

14:09.090 --> 14:10.374
(tapping on glass)

14:12.870 --> 14:14.344
Was I speeding, officer?

14:16.147 --> 14:17.835
You don't look like
you're from around here.

14:17.931 --> 14:19.637
No, sir.

14:22.354 --> 14:23.929
You been doing
any drugs tonight?

14:23.951 --> 14:24.952
No, sir.

14:25.022 --> 14:26.432
- Nope?
- No.

14:29.534 --> 14:30.840
Why don't you
pop that trunk,

14:30.856 --> 14:32.563
step out of the vehicle
for me, please.

14:33.264 --> 14:34.829
- Really?
- Yeah.

14:37.603 --> 14:39.070
(trunk pops)

14:39.110 --> 14:39.977
(sighs)
(seatbelt clicks)

14:42.057 --> 14:43.540
No drugs, huh?

14:43.918 --> 14:45.922
Nope.
(indistinct radio chatter)

14:47.656 --> 14:49.210
Well, well, well.

14:51.977 --> 14:53.611
(trunk closes)
What have we here?

14:53.653 --> 14:57.180
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
<i>You</i> planted that in my car.

14:57.222 --> 14:58.907
Oh, did I?

15:01.579 --> 15:02.942
Or... did I plant this?

15:02.961 --> 15:04.977
Uh... I real... I guess...

15:05.018 --> 15:06.230
Up against the car,
right now.

15:06.298 --> 15:07.201
- Oh!
- Spread 'em!

15:07.242 --> 15:09.170
- Uh...
- Huh, what's going...

15:09.234 --> 15:11.144
Whoa, whoa.
What do we have here, huh?

15:11.187 --> 15:13.054
- What?
- These your colors, homie?

15:13.122 --> 15:14.674
- That's... that's not mine. Huh...
- Huh?

15:14.756 --> 15:16.136
- No, I don't know what that...
- What? No?

15:16.200 --> 15:17.801
Or are these your colors?

15:17.869 --> 15:20.370
Or perhaps these
are your colors.

15:21.045 --> 15:22.723
Or are these... ?
Look at all these colors.

15:22.739 --> 15:24.653
Man, you sure got
a lot of colors.

15:24.680 --> 15:26.981
- I don't...
- Look at all of these colors.

15:27.075 --> 15:29.166
- What, this is...
- Wasah!

15:32.856 --> 15:34.924
- Are you a real cop?
- Freeze!

15:34.992 --> 15:36.823
What is that?

15:36.901 --> 15:37.928
Mm.

15:38.465 --> 15:40.030
Well, well, well.

15:40.413 --> 15:42.434
It looks like
an illegal firearm.

15:43.526 --> 15:44.672
Or...

15:45.970 --> 15:47.805
Is it? Ahh.
(dove cooing)

15:47.872 --> 15:48.866
Oh.

15:53.993 --> 15:55.861
I'm... I don't...
I don't know what this is.

15:55.953 --> 15:57.788
- I'm sorry.
- Pick a card.

15:58.268 --> 15:59.842
That's not even a good fan.

15:59.883 --> 16:01.751
Any card.
You can just stick... there.

16:01.768 --> 16:03.335
- Okay, you took that card?
- Yeah.

16:03.377 --> 16:05.146
- Now, can you remember that card?
- Yes.

16:05.156 --> 16:06.464
Can you commit that card
to memory?

16:06.502 --> 16:08.374
- This is unbelievable.
- Have you done so?

16:08.510 --> 16:10.177
- Have you done so?
- Yes.

16:10.401 --> 16:13.478
Please insert the card back
into the deck randomly.

16:13.492 --> 16:14.131
Done.

16:14.199 --> 16:16.934
It's in a different place than
where you took it originally?

16:17.002 --> 16:19.596
- There.
- There we are. There we are.

16:19.661 --> 16:22.880
- This is ridiculous.
- Now, I take the deck like so.

16:23.311 --> 16:27.063
I give it a "skasloisles"
and "abracasloish."

16:28.398 --> 16:31.304
(gunshot)
Uh, fu... wha...

16:32.051 --> 16:34.151
Okay...
(gasps)

16:35.757 --> 16:39.123
Ahh. Is this...
your card?

16:39.150 --> 16:41.051
- No!
- Are you sure?

16:41.051 --> 16:42.318
I want your badge number.

16:42.389 --> 16:43.752
(coughing)

16:44.136 --> 16:46.404
Oh. Oh. Oh!

16:47.665 --> 16:50.601
(coughing)

16:50.668 --> 16:53.274
Uh... uh... wha...

16:54.060 --> 16:55.145
Okay...

16:56.111 --> 16:57.344
- Oh!
- Haah.

16:57.490 --> 16:58.661
Uh...

16:59.206 --> 17:00.940
It's my ca...
How did you do that?

17:01.085 --> 17:02.463
Ahh.

17:04.464 --> 17:05.664
And...

17:06.734 --> 17:07.894
that is for you.

17:09.969 --> 17:12.369
After all that,
you're still giving me a ticket?

17:12.696 --> 17:14.060
Is it a ticket?

17:14.473 --> 17:17.982
Or is it a two-for-one coupon
for my show

17:18.000 --> 17:20.442
at the Magic House
Thursday night at 11:00 p.m.?

17:21.046 --> 17:22.867
Your call.

17:26.700 --> 17:28.133
I'll take the ticket.

17:28.783 --> 17:30.150
Great. Okay.

17:31.384 --> 17:33.151
(soul music)

17:33.219 --> 17:34.419
(applause)

17:34.487 --> 17:36.388
Do you want to talk
about that tweet?

17:36.455 --> 17:38.115
- Well there... yes, there was...
- Yeah.

17:38.188 --> 17:40.660
Wha... uh, a few months ago,
I did a...

17:40.724 --> 17:44.162
a tweet that,
uh... it was a...

17:44.919 --> 17:46.353
basically,
a hypothetical.

17:46.353 --> 17:48.155
- Mm-hmm.
- And it asked the question,

17:48.222 --> 17:51.024
"What if names were farts?"
(laughter)

17:51.092 --> 17:52.026
- Mm-hmm.
- What if,

17:52.093 --> 17:55.264
instead of names,
we had signature farts?

17:55.282 --> 17:58.518
We were identified,
personally, by farts.

18:00.890 --> 18:02.649
And we felt
that it was a good idea...

18:05.065 --> 18:07.860
to use <i>lots</i>
of Comedy Central's money

18:09.935 --> 18:13.358
to bring you this scene
based on that very premise.

18:13.815 --> 18:15.415
Shame on you if you laugh.

18:15.457 --> 18:16.857
(laughter)

18:16.951 --> 18:18.285
Please, enjoy.
(cheers and applause)

18:19.865 --> 18:21.499
(crowd chattering)

18:21.567 --> 18:24.233
- Honey, someone's here.
- Oh. Okay.

18:27.936 --> 18:30.471
Oh, hey (farts),
good to see you.

18:30.591 --> 18:32.325
Thanks for having us,
(farts).

18:32.392 --> 18:34.427
This is my girlfriend,
(farts).

18:34.443 --> 18:35.621
We're so happy
you could join us.

18:35.636 --> 18:37.504
And this is my wife,
(farts).

18:37.767 --> 18:39.635
So this is the infamous

18:39.707 --> 18:41.816
(farts) and (farts).

18:41.960 --> 18:44.295
(farts) has told me
so much about you both.

18:44.338 --> 18:45.872
(laughs)
All good things I hope.

18:45.964 --> 18:47.860
(laughter)
You can never trust (farts).

18:47.952 --> 18:49.820
Hey, wait a minute.
(laughter)

18:49.887 --> 18:51.760
And please, please,
don't call me (farts).

18:51.827 --> 18:53.559
It makes me think
my mother's around someplace.

18:53.606 --> 18:54.577
Oh.

18:55.611 --> 18:58.213
Hey, you know, where is
little (squeaking fart)?

18:58.255 --> 19:01.790
Oh, she's at (farts)'s house
for a slumber party.

19:01.858 --> 19:05.583
- Ah.
- Oh, um, (farts) and (farts),

19:05.601 --> 19:07.170
there's... this is the couple
from New York

19:07.209 --> 19:08.742
that we wanted you guys
to meet.

19:08.759 --> 19:12.374
Uh, this is (farts)
and her husband (honking fart).

19:12.390 --> 19:14.146
They're gonna be in New York
for a few weeks,

19:14.146 --> 19:15.794
so we were hoping you could
give them some tips.

19:15.794 --> 19:16.521
- Ooh.
- Sure.

19:16.551 --> 19:17.751
Oh, that'd be great.

19:17.921 --> 19:21.457
So, how do you know
(farts) and (farts)?

19:21.499 --> 19:23.814
Oh, well (farts)
and I went to

19:23.909 --> 19:26.845
(deep, rumbling fart)
School of Dramatic Arts,

19:26.886 --> 19:29.555
back when (honking fart)
was working in midtown.

19:29.623 --> 19:31.223
- Mm.
- Oh, where did you work?

19:31.291 --> 19:35.069
I was at (farts), (farts),
(farts),

19:35.116 --> 19:36.858
 and (bellowing fart).

19:37.051 --> 19:37.928
Oh, the law firm.

19:37.970 --> 19:39.804
- Hey!
- Oh, hey.

19:39.846 --> 19:41.379
- Ha!
- How are you?

19:41.421 --> 19:43.289
- It's so good to see you.
- Good to see you.

19:43.331 --> 19:44.390
Come here.
Hey, everybody,

19:44.437 --> 19:47.709
this is
(high-pitched fart).

19:47.803 --> 19:49.256
I want you meet
one of my dearest,

19:49.287 --> 19:50.668
oldest friends, (farts).

19:50.685 --> 19:51.619
This is his girlfriend,
(farts).

19:51.634 --> 19:52.580
- Hi.
- Hey.

19:52.597 --> 19:53.973
- Hello.
- Of course, you know (farts).

19:54.014 --> 19:55.948
- Oh, hi.
- This is (farts),

19:55.965 --> 19:58.576
and this is her husband,
(honking fart).

19:58.593 --> 20:00.661
- Hi.
- What a beautiful name.

20:00.703 --> 20:03.338
You know, I knew
a (high-pitched fart)

20:03.740 --> 20:04.974
in grad school.

20:05.010 --> 20:06.078
All: Oh.

20:06.095 --> 20:08.196
Well, thank you,
but it's actually pronounced

20:08.367 --> 20:10.445
(high-pitched fart).

20:11.143 --> 20:14.017
Wow, I swear that sounds like
what you were saying (farts).

20:14.050 --> 20:14.446
I don't know.

20:14.463 --> 20:15.973
Anyways, it's lovely
to meet you all.

20:15.992 --> 20:18.324
Yeah, yeah, okay, yes.
(laughter)

20:18.569 --> 20:20.174
Robert!

20:22.793 --> 20:24.821
I'm so sorry.
Heinrich!

20:26.210 --> 20:27.425
I'll...

20:27.493 --> 20:29.128
show myself to the restroom.

20:29.255 --> 20:30.522
(sighs)
Wow, uh...

20:30.642 --> 20:32.743
- Jeez.
- So rude.

20:32.784 --> 20:35.219
Well, for (farts)'s sake.

20:36.261 --> 20:38.829
(applause)
Thank you, everybody.

20:38.871 --> 20:40.631
Thank you so much
for coming out.

20:40.671 --> 20:42.672
I am the Yellow Falcon.

20:42.687 --> 20:44.725
I am the Black Fal...
Green Falcon!

20:44.746 --> 20:46.165
- Green, oh--

20:46.460 --> 20:47.994
Good night, everybody.
