01:41.388 --> 01:43.838
In the shadow
of the big city,

01:43.890 --> 01:47.392
with its big buildings,
big business, and big people,

01:47.644 --> 01:49.843
is my home town Tromaville.

01:50.395 --> 01:54.148
A little town with little buildings,
little businesses,

01:54.300 --> 01:56.101
and little people.

01:57.653 --> 02:00.051
My name is Melvin Junko.

02:00.103 --> 02:04.607
I live in a garden apartment
in the Tromaville Dump.

02:04.659 --> 02:07.610
I am the first
hideously deformed monster hero

02:07.662 --> 02:09.610
of superhuman size
and strength

02:09.663 --> 02:12.113
to come from New Jeresy.

02:12.614 --> 02:16.619
They call me
the Toxic Avenger.

02:20.120 --> 02:23.122
This is my story.

02:23.623 --> 02:25.072
Several years ago,

02:25.124 --> 02:27.526
I and the little people
of Tromaville

02:27.626 --> 02:29.527
succeeded in crushing
all criminals

02:29.628 --> 02:32.029
and ridding Tromaville
once and for all

02:32.081 --> 02:34.532
of evil and corruption.

02:35.633 --> 02:39.839
Tromaville actually became
a nice place to live.

02:44.140 --> 02:48.043
With no criminals or oppressive
politicians around,

02:48.143 --> 02:51.148
people of Tromaville were
once again happy.

02:54.848 --> 02:57.799
Once again they were free
to devote themselves

02:57.851 --> 03:02.356
to their principal activities
of dancing in the streets...

03:03.556 --> 03:05.358
tattooing...

03:09.059 --> 03:11.563
manufacturing orange juice...

03:14.165 --> 03:16.668
exterminating vermin...

03:20.170 --> 03:22.872
watching excellent movies...

03:25.174 --> 03:28.079
and dancing in the streets!

03:35.182 --> 03:37.083
The important people
in my life

03:37.184 --> 03:38.785
all lived in Tromaville-

03:38.837 --> 03:42.087
My Mom,
- It's your Mommy! Melvin!

03:42.188 --> 03:44.438
My freudian psychiatrist,

03:44.490 --> 03:47.192
I've been doing
some soul searching of my own.

03:47.744 --> 03:51.796
And most important,
my best girl Claire.

03:52.248 --> 03:54.146
Although Claire was blind,

03:54.198 --> 03:56.100
her handicap didn't
prevent her

03:56.152 --> 03:58.228
from being
a real intellectual.

03:59.280 --> 04:01.652
Now that Tromaville
had no crime,

04:01.704 --> 04:04.808
there was no work
for a super hero like me.

04:09.210 --> 04:12.613
There were no criminals left
for me to destroy.

04:12.765 --> 04:15.015
I took a job
as concierge

04:15.215 --> 04:17.216
at the Tromaville Center
for the blind,

04:17.267 --> 04:19.394
where Claire spent
much of her time.

04:19.446 --> 04:21.620
It was the only way
to make ends meet.

04:21.772 --> 04:23.722
Claire had the kind of end

04:23.822 --> 04:26.424
that you really wanted
to meet.

04:28.376 --> 04:30.002
I was also athletic director

04:30.054 --> 04:31.892
at the Center of the blind,

04:31.944 --> 04:34.079
which kept me
kind of busy.

04:34.331 --> 04:38.334
My duties included
organizing croquet games,

04:38.786 --> 04:41.012
planning rooftop nature walks,

04:41.064 --> 04:43.402
and refereeing
basketball games.

04:43.454 --> 04:45.688
As rewarding
as this work was,

04:45.740 --> 04:48.743
I have to admit
I was pretty depressed.

04:49.243 --> 04:52.246
I missed the good old days
of criminal bashing.

04:52.298 --> 04:54.696
You know,
beating up bad guys.

04:54.748 --> 04:59.752
Then... one day our lives
were thrown into upheaval.

04:59.804 --> 05:01.201
The peace and tranquility

05:01.253 --> 05:03.255
to which we had grown
accustomed

05:03.307 --> 05:04.756
was suddenly shattered!

05:04.808 --> 05:05.905
Claire.

05:06.757 --> 05:08.259
Yes, Mrs. Beasley.

05:08.311 --> 05:09.960
Oooh!

05:11.360 --> 05:15.513
Your boyfriend,
the Toxic whatchihoosit,

05:15.565 --> 05:19.167
is melting all the silverware
in the house.

05:19.319 --> 05:20.368
Oh, dear!

05:20.369 --> 05:21.370
Melvin!

05:21.770 --> 05:24.373
Melvin, you don't have to set
the table tonight.

05:24.474 --> 05:26.775
Why don't you clean
the oven?

05:26.827 --> 05:28.377
OK, dear.

05:28.477 --> 05:31.379
I suppose you want me
to clean the toilets, too.

05:31.479 --> 05:33.680
Yes, dear.
Thank you.

05:34.280 --> 05:36.582
Attention, all blind people.

05:36.583 --> 05:39.033
Lunch is now
being served inside.

05:39.085 --> 05:41.986
All blind persons
please find your way

05:41.987 --> 05:43.688
to the cafeteria.

05:43.840 --> 05:45.237
Poor Melvin.

05:46.289 --> 05:48.691
He's been
so depressed lately.

05:48.792 --> 05:50.794
His psychiatrist says
it's very important

05:50.846 --> 05:52.695
for him to feel needed.

05:52.896 --> 05:56.097
There just doesn't seem
to be any more evil

05:56.149 --> 05:58.500
in Tromaville
for him to clean up.

05:58.700 --> 06:01.503
It's not good for him
to feel useless.

06:10.607 --> 06:11.607
Mr. Chairman,

06:11.707 --> 06:13.509
that's the Toxic Avenger's
girlfriend.

06:13.661 --> 06:15.259
Ha ha ha!

06:15.511 --> 06:17.312
He must be inside.

06:17.313 --> 06:18.313
OK.

06:19.414 --> 06:20.915
Give the order.

06:33.726 --> 06:35.928
OK, you,
come on. Let's go.

06:36.829 --> 06:38.031
Mmmph!

06:39.931 --> 06:41.433
Get a receipt.

06:46.056 --> 06:47.257
Excuse me, miss.

06:50.759 --> 06:52.008
Oh, sorry.

06:52.060 --> 06:54.562
I got a package here
for the Toxic Avenger.

06:55.851 --> 06:57.300
He's inside working.

06:57.352 --> 06:59.254
Could you sign
for it, please?

06:59.254 --> 07:00.255
OK.

07:02.556 --> 07:04.158
No. Right down here.

07:06.060 --> 07:07.261
OK. Thank you.

07:08.543 --> 07:09.793
What is it?

07:09.845 --> 07:11.846
Make sure he gets it,
because it's awfully big.

07:11.998 --> 07:13.047
It feels nice.

07:13.448 --> 07:14.596
Ohhh!

07:15.348 --> 07:17.751
Oh, Toxie! Oh! Oh!

07:18.551 --> 07:20.000
I have a surprise!

07:20.052 --> 07:21.553
I have a surprise
for Toxie!

07:21.605 --> 07:23.255
He's going to be
so excited.

07:25.357 --> 07:26.858
Oh! Oh! Oh!

07:27.159 --> 07:29.108
Help me! Help me!

07:29.160 --> 07:31.162
I'm stuck!
The lunch bell rang!

07:31.214 --> 07:32.263
Lady! Lady!

07:32.663 --> 07:33.664
Help me! I'm stuck!

07:34.165 --> 07:36.166
Let go of me!
What are you, blind?

07:38.168 --> 07:39.169
Clarie! Clarie!

07:39.221 --> 07:41.170
Ha ha ha!

07:41.671 --> 07:43.422
Aaah!

07:43.474 --> 07:45.174
Clarie!

07:49.177 --> 07:50.678
Oh, my god!
Mrs. Beasley!

07:51.179 --> 07:53.180
Mrs. Beasley!
Are you all right?

07:56.183 --> 07:57.184
Aaah! Aaah!

07:58.184 --> 08:00.186
Oh, my god!

08:11.195 --> 08:12.196
Aaah!

08:14.698 --> 08:17.700
Help me! Help me!

08:24.706 --> 08:27.109
Come on! Let's go!

08:27.261 --> 08:29.510
Ha ha ha!

08:33.011 --> 08:34.162
All right!

08:34.760 --> 08:37.664
Man! That old lady,
I wasted her!

08:37.716 --> 08:39.866
Good boy!
We pulled it off.

08:39.966 --> 08:41.116
All right!

08:41.369 --> 08:42.716
Ha ha ha!

08:42.791 --> 08:45.595
I should be getting a
big raise out of this job.

08:46.264 --> 08:49.267
We made waste product
out of that Toxic bastard.

08:49.367 --> 08:51.669
I love to watch things
blow up.

08:55.963 --> 08:57.866
Did you see that blast?

08:57.918 --> 08:59.214
Ha ha ha!

08:59.466 --> 09:02.469
That's the end
of the Toxic Avenger.

09:02.521 --> 09:05.070
Ha ha ha!

09:22.085 --> 09:24.034
Ha ha ha!

09:24.686 --> 09:27.490
We're changing
this town now!

09:28.190 --> 09:29.692
Did you see
that blast?

09:29.844 --> 09:31.894
Oh, yeah.

09:35.197 --> 09:36.698
How are ya?

09:37.150 --> 09:38.625
Aaah!

09:38.777 --> 09:40.200
Grrr!

09:40.301 --> 09:42.302
Help!

09:48.707 --> 09:50.058
Grrr!

09:53.595 --> 09:55.996
Oh! Oh! Oh!

10:08.607 --> 10:10.609
Aaah!

10:26.322 --> 10:28.073
Grrr!

10:31.626 --> 10:34.128
Messy, messy, messy!

11:44.486 --> 11:45.587
Get him!

11:46.706 --> 11:48.208
Come on! take him!

11:48.708 --> 11:49.909
He's yours.

11:52.711 --> 11:54.212
Grrr!

12:13.029 --> 12:15.050
Aaaah!

12:18.634 --> 12:19.734
Mmmph.

12:21.736 --> 12:22.937
Take this.

12:37.830 --> 12:39.179
Fuck this!

12:39.231 --> 12:43.035
Now you gotta deal with me,
Toxic asshole.

12:45.337 --> 12:47.639
Why, I ought a...

13:00.893 --> 13:02.395
Take him.

13:03.495 --> 13:04.997
Let's go.
Get on with it.

13:05.049 --> 13:06.446
Come on!

13:06.498 --> 13:08.300
Get that
Toxic Avenger.

13:08.500 --> 13:09.501
Come on!

13:10.501 --> 13:12.604
All the men
we've got!

13:13.005 --> 13:14.206
He's all yours.

13:14.407 --> 13:16.008
Get that
for the chief!

15:19.540 --> 15:20.791
Hey, Toxic.

15:21.343 --> 15:22.591
Hey, Toxic!

15:23.115 --> 15:24.342
Hey, Toxic!

15:24.443 --> 15:26.348
What's the matter?
Can't you hear me?

15:26.400 --> 15:28.297
You slimebucket, you!

15:28.349 --> 15:30.851
Can't you hear me?
Hey, Toxic!

15:49.633 --> 15:51.034
Yeah, kemo sabe.

15:51.035 --> 15:52.536
I can hear you.

15:52.936 --> 15:54.337
Can you hear me?

16:50.307 --> 16:53.310
Lucky for you, it's time
for my piano lesson.

17:02.782 --> 17:06.285
Take this,
you savage, Toxic, you.

17:10.851 --> 17:12.352
Yeee!

17:27.364 --> 17:29.366
Ahhh!

17:30.367 --> 17:31.868
Ahhh!

17:31.920 --> 17:33.369
Aaah!

17:34.570 --> 17:36.572
One of our best men.

17:37.873 --> 17:40.375
Ya ha ha ha!

17:40.876 --> 17:43.878
Ha ha ha!

17:45.381 --> 17:46.461
Grr!

17:52.285 --> 17:53.295
Ya!

17:54.286 --> 17:55.787
Yaa!

17:57.113 --> 17:58.514
Aaah!

17:58.866 --> 18:00.764
Grrr!

18:26.016 --> 18:31.020
What are you
doing to me?

18:31.528 --> 18:34.030
After a long day
of crime fighting,

18:34.082 --> 18:36.833
I like to play
a little basketball.

18:52.246 --> 18:53.695
Grr!

18:53.747 --> 18:55.248
Hee hee hee!

19:12.763 --> 19:14.264
Oh, shit!

19:20.269 --> 19:21.770
I- I-I don't know.

19:21.822 --> 19:23.219
I mean, he's big.

19:23.271 --> 19:24.773
and we planned it well,
and I-

19:24.825 --> 19:26.274
I didn't know-

19:26.774 --> 19:29.276
Call a meeting of the board
of directors,

19:29.328 --> 19:31.778
and fire the entire
personnel department!

19:39.583 --> 19:41.186
He's coming.
Let me in!

19:41.186 --> 19:42.187
Ohh!

19:46.290 --> 19:48.041
Waah!

19:50.505 --> 19:51.654
Oh, little baby.

19:51.806 --> 19:53.958
Don't cry.
I got you.

19:54.010 --> 19:56.210
Let's go find
your mommy.

19:59.713 --> 20:02.715
Aaah! Aaah!
Oh, my god!

20:02.767 --> 20:04.717
Aaah! Aaah!

20:08.220 --> 20:10.121
Oh, my god!
Where's my baby!

20:10.222 --> 20:12.623
Where is she?
Where is she?

20:12.724 --> 20:14.925
Here you go, ma'am.
Here's your baby.

20:15.577 --> 20:17.152
She was up a tree.

20:17.404 --> 20:19.128
Thank you, Toxic.

20:19.934 --> 20:22.436
They killed my Melvin.

20:23.436 --> 20:26.439
Melvin! They killed
my Melvin!

20:26.491 --> 20:27.940
Oh, Melvin!

20:29.441 --> 20:31.443
Aaah! Aaah!

20:36.948 --> 20:38.949
Apocalypse Chemicals!

20:39.450 --> 20:41.451
Grrr!

20:43.054 --> 20:44.354
Claire! Claire!

20:44.806 --> 20:46.055
Claire!

20:47.823 --> 20:48.925
Are you all right?

20:49.025 --> 20:50.526
Thank God
you're all right!

20:50.881 --> 20:52.331
I thought
they killed you!

20:53.332 --> 20:54.380
What happened?

20:54.432 --> 20:57.335
I felt the heat
and a terrible sound.

20:57.687 --> 20:59.936
And then I felt
a head!

21:00.055 --> 21:01.606
Where is everyone?

21:01.658 --> 21:03.358
- Where's Mrs. Beasley?
- Clarie!

21:04.058 --> 21:05.408
They were...

21:05.460 --> 21:07.461
They were senselessly
butchered!

21:08.362 --> 21:09.863
Ohh, Melvin!

21:12.291 --> 21:15.294
But at least I got the slime
who did it.

21:15.794 --> 21:20.398
Oh, Melvin,
you're wonderful.

21:20.550 --> 21:21.647
Oh, Claire.

21:21.799 --> 21:24.201
Claire may have thought
I was wonderful,

21:24.301 --> 21:26.603
but across the river
in the big city

21:26.704 --> 21:28.806
there were some big people
who didn't think

21:28.858 --> 21:30.255
I was so wonderful.

21:30.271 --> 21:35.274
The Evil, Egomaniacal Chairman
of Apocalypse Incorporated,

21:35.326 --> 21:38.603
the massive, Multinational
Chemical Conglomerate

21:38.655 --> 21:41.880
plotting to destroy me
and take over Tromaville.

21:45.952 --> 21:47.952
SCENA IN PIU'

25:33.989 --> 25:37.288
As long as
the Toxic Avenger lives,

25:37.540 --> 25:40.642
we will be prevented
from achieving our goals.

25:41.094 --> 25:44.221
We will never win over
the hearts and minds

25:44.273 --> 25:46.648
of all the little people
of Tromaville,

25:46.700 --> 25:47.897
whom we need

25:48.349 --> 25:52.202
because without them,
we'll never take Tromaville.

25:52.354 --> 25:56.908
And without Tromaville,
we'll never take New York.

25:57.060 --> 26:03.062
And without New York,
we're just an infernal failure!

26:04.763 --> 26:10.268
Bu-bu-but, Boss,
we can't kill him!

26:10.768 --> 26:13.771
We used enough explosives
to blow up an entire city.

26:14.271 --> 26:18.274
So what if our explosives
had no effect.

26:18.326 --> 26:21.052
We are Apocalypse
incorporated.

26:21.104 --> 26:23.779
We do not shrink
at setbacks.

26:23.831 --> 26:26.057
We want the challenge!

26:27.209 --> 26:29.931
Gentlemen, as we speak,

26:29.983 --> 26:33.085
our research department
is studying his background,

26:33.585 --> 26:36.788
and we will come up
with a suitable demise

26:36.840 --> 26:39.592
for that Toxic
troublemaker.

26:39.744 --> 26:40.993
And then...

26:41.394 --> 26:42.543
I'll get a hold

26:42.595 --> 26:47.999
of that blonde, blind, bimbo,
whore, bitch girlfriend of his

26:48.351 --> 26:51.701
with those long legs- Ooh!

26:51.702 --> 26:54.804
And those
melon-heavy breasts.

26:54.856 --> 26:57.082
I'd like
to take her hair

26:57.134 --> 26:59.256
and wrap it
around her neck!

26:59.308 --> 27:02.811
I want to strangle her
till her eyes bugged out!

27:07.478 --> 27:10.481
His real name
is Melvin Junko.

27:10.981 --> 27:13.384
He was nothing
but a puny janitor

27:13.436 --> 27:14.833
At a health club.

27:15.016 --> 27:18.018
In reel two
of the first movie,

27:18.319 --> 27:20.669
As a result
of a harmless prank,

27:20.721 --> 27:24.073
Melvin fell into a barrel
of toxic waste.

27:24.325 --> 27:27.927
This caused his tiny body
to transform

27:27.979 --> 27:31.205
into a hideously deformed
creature

27:31.257 --> 27:34.532
of superhuman size
and strength.

27:34.533 --> 27:38.284
He became...
The Toxic Avenger.

27:39.036 --> 27:41.986
Due to the toxic chemicals
in his body,

27:42.038 --> 27:46.042
Melvin destroyed all the evil
in Tromaville.

27:46.342 --> 27:50.345
Tromaville actually became
a nice place to live.

27:51.301 --> 27:54.253
You see, the chemicals
in the Toxic Avenger's body

27:54.305 --> 27:57.056
cause him to automatically
destroy evil.

27:57.108 --> 27:59.406
Our scientists say
this is caused

27:59.458 --> 28:03.160
by weird particles in his body
called Tromations.

28:03.857 --> 28:05.255
To destroy
the Toxic Avenger,

28:05.307 --> 28:08.410
we must destroy
the Tromations in his body.

28:08.962 --> 28:11.011
How do we conquer
this tromation?

28:11.447 --> 28:12.795
Technology.

28:12.996 --> 28:15.399
And where do we
find technology?

28:15.699 --> 28:17.350
Gentlemen, think.

28:17.918 --> 28:19.118
Cars...

28:19.582 --> 28:20.883
TVs...

28:21.358 --> 28:22.883
Walkmans.

28:23.235 --> 28:24.956
Japan!

28:25.256 --> 28:28.260
Anybody knows that if you
wany something to work,

28:28.312 --> 28:30.409
you buy
a japanese product.

28:30.461 --> 28:32.911
Even comic-book villains
like us know

28:32.963 --> 28:36.266
if you want it done right,
you must turn to Japan.

28:36.304 --> 28:39.206
Scientists at the Apocalypse
Japanese Division

28:39.206 --> 28:43.008
will create
an anti-tromaton,

28:43.060 --> 28:45.159
and then
that will be it.

28:45.211 --> 28:49.514
That Toxic Avenger
will just shrivel up

28:49.566 --> 28:51.964
like a prune.

28:52.234 --> 28:54.330
Speaking of prunes,

28:54.555 --> 28:57.510
that girlfriend of his-
Ha ha ha!

28:57.538 --> 29:01.290
I would just love to shrivel up
those melons of hers!

29:01.342 --> 29:04.343
Boy, I could
get my hands on...

29:07.080 --> 29:08.210
Wait a minute.

29:08.262 --> 29:10.183
You said this
anit-tromaton substance

29:10.235 --> 29:11.833
is in Japan.

29:12.085 --> 29:14.286
Can we get this
from Japan

29:14.287 --> 29:15.588
to New Jersey?

29:15.709 --> 29:17.359
That would be
very chancy,

29:17.411 --> 29:19.313
considering
its volatile nature.

29:19.334 --> 29:20.836
However, we have a plan

29:20.837 --> 29:23.439
to get the Toxic Avenger
to Japan.

29:24.391 --> 29:26.789
He's been seeing
a psychiatrist.

29:26.841 --> 29:29.291
We know he has
complete faith in her.

29:29.443 --> 29:32.945
It's just a matter
of determining her price.

29:34.097 --> 29:35.394
No problem.

29:35.446 --> 29:37.448
We'll get that jerk...

29:39.363 --> 29:41.364
no matter what.

29:42.800 --> 29:46.303
Now, that is what
I like to hear!

29:47.992 --> 29:48.993
He...

29:48.993 --> 29:49.994
must...

29:50.046 --> 29:51.143
be...

29:51.195 --> 29:53.196
destroyed.

29:58.399 --> 29:59.547
Beating up bad guys

29:59.599 --> 30:01.703
should've made me feel good
about myself,

30:01.884 --> 30:03.834
but back
at our garden apartment,

30:03.861 --> 30:06.864
I was still experiencing
feeling of uselessness

30:07.116 --> 30:10.343
and subseguent bouts
of deep depression.

30:10.780 --> 30:13.169
So many innocent blind people
had died

30:13.236 --> 30:15.605
before I could do anything
to save them.

30:15.657 --> 30:18.723
I went into a real
emotional tailspin.

30:18.775 --> 30:21.576
I was in such a state,
Claire even suggested

30:21.600 --> 30:23.851
I increase
my psychiatrist visits

30:23.863 --> 30:25.112
to eight times a week

30:25.353 --> 30:27.402
instead of
the usual seven.

30:28.454 --> 30:30.956
This should make you
feel better.

30:36.060 --> 30:37.061
Ergh...

30:37.961 --> 30:38.982
Melvin,

30:39.263 --> 30:41.264
I made
your favorite.

30:42.295 --> 30:43.896
It's your favorite!

30:44.248 --> 30:45.545
Ta-da!

30:46.097 --> 30:47.799
Chicken a la...

30:48.351 --> 30:49.849
Clorox.

30:50.100 --> 30:51.601
Oh, well,
all right.

30:59.269 --> 31:01.370
Melvin, must you always

31:01.371 --> 31:03.472
smother my cooking
in drano

31:03.573 --> 31:05.575
before you even
taste it?

31:05.798 --> 31:07.247
I'm sorry, OK?

31:09.495 --> 31:11.197
I'm sorry, Claire.

31:12.049 --> 31:13.098
I...

31:13.099 --> 31:15.049
I just feel so useless.

31:15.201 --> 31:17.702
Oh, Melvin, you were great
this morning-

31:18.002 --> 31:19.304
The way
you took apart

31:19.304 --> 31:20.854
all those
smelly men.

31:23.106 --> 31:25.006
There's still evil
in Tromaville

31:25.058 --> 31:26.607
for you
to clean up.

31:26.673 --> 31:28.474
Plenty of evil
for you!

31:28.475 --> 31:29.495
Grrgh.

31:38.783 --> 31:40.384
I should've
been faster!

31:41.385 --> 31:44.387
All those innocent
blind people...

31:45.139 --> 31:46.889
are dead.

31:54.247 --> 31:57.250
I couldn't snap out
of my depression.

31:57.750 --> 32:01.454
Usually I felt better
after sunday church services,

32:01.506 --> 32:03.403
but not this time.

32:04.055 --> 32:07.157
My psychiatrist had attributed
my emotional problems

32:07.209 --> 32:08.935
to the face
that I was raised

32:08.987 --> 32:10.810
in a single-parent
household,

32:10.977 --> 32:14.081
my father having left home
when I was a tiny baby.

32:20.804 --> 32:21.954
But I always felt

32:21.960 --> 32:23.563
that Mom had more than
filled the void

32:23.573 --> 32:25.070
when Dad left.

32:25.197 --> 32:27.800
Mom had been
a great father figure.

32:32.904 --> 32:34.354
Uhh...

32:34.393 --> 32:37.695
The clouds of despair
followed me everywhere.

32:37.947 --> 32:39.345
Uhh...

32:40.591 --> 32:42.793
And I mean everywhere.

32:43.394 --> 32:44.445
Uh!

32:46.195 --> 32:47.246
Oh!

32:49.294 --> 32:51.294
SCENA IN PIU'

34:17.303 --> 34:18.303
Please, darling,

34:18.304 --> 34:20.054
try to eat something.
Eat.

34:20.060 --> 34:21.360
There's some nice
cleaning fluid

34:21.409 --> 34:22.784
under the sink.

34:23.020 --> 34:24.291
I've got to go now.

34:24.300 --> 34:28.002
I've got
a bar mitzvah.

34:28.344 --> 34:29.547
Shall I bring you
something

34:29.599 --> 34:30.824
from the supermarket?

34:30.876 --> 34:33.150
Some sani-flush, maybe?

34:34.202 --> 34:36.152
Oy, oy, oy! Oh!

34:36.152 --> 34:37.302
It wasn't long

34:37.353 --> 34:39.956
before I became a genuine
emotional basket case.

34:42.004 --> 34:44.004
SCENA IN PIU'

34:48.297 --> 34:50.100
I was so depressed

34:50.100 --> 34:52.803
that I didn't even notice
that my psychiatrist,

34:52.855 --> 34:54.905
who had always been
a strict freudian,

34:55.005 --> 34:56.853
suddenly began practicing

34:56.906 --> 35:00.610
some kind of progressive
new gestalt psychotherapy.

35:01.553 --> 35:04.651
...that the mind,
though important,

35:04.703 --> 35:10.708
is only one very
small part of the whole.

35:10.760 --> 35:13.010
The rest, Melvin,
is the flesh!

35:13.062 --> 35:14.159
The flesh!

35:14.411 --> 35:16.861
The flesh and sex!

35:16.913 --> 35:18.414
It is sex
which links us

35:18.466 --> 35:20.991
to our innermost selves.

35:20.992 --> 35:22.818
I should been suspicious.

35:22.943 --> 35:24.365
I should have surmised

35:24.417 --> 35:26.119
that the evil
Apocalypse Corporation

35:26.119 --> 35:27.469
had bought her off,

35:27.521 --> 35:29.523
but because of
my monster-sized depression.

35:29.824 --> 35:31.173
I was like Putty,

35:31.225 --> 35:33.527
Toxic Putty in her hands.

35:34.228 --> 35:35.277
Wow!

35:36.288 --> 35:38.290
It all sounds
so complicated.

35:38.291 --> 35:40.667
I mean,
where would I begin?

35:41.070 --> 35:43.494
Oh, where
we all must begin.

35:43.546 --> 35:44.771
And where's that?

35:44.772 --> 35:46.545
With your father!

35:48.029 --> 35:49.178
My father?

35:49.230 --> 35:52.432
My father left when I was a child.
I don't even know him.

35:53.276 --> 35:57.379
But that's only
a very small obstacle.

35:57.431 --> 35:58.729
I've done some checking.

35:58.781 --> 36:01.883
I discovered that
your father Phineas T. Junko,

36:01.935 --> 36:05.661
better known as Big Mac,

36:05.713 --> 36:09.535
now lives
in Tokyo, Japan.

36:10.483 --> 36:13.688
Oh. Tokyo, Japan.
Give me his address,

36:13.690 --> 36:15.040
and I'll
drop him a line.

36:15.091 --> 36:16.339
Oh, no, Melvin.

36:16.458 --> 36:20.709
Oh, Melvin,
this is getting tedious.

36:21.061 --> 36:24.063
You must go to him
and see him in person.

36:24.115 --> 36:26.041
Me? Go to Japan?

36:26.496 --> 36:28.970
Ohh! Uh-huh.

36:29.971 --> 36:32.374
If I go there
and talk to my dad,

36:32.644 --> 36:34.094
I can work things out?

36:34.146 --> 36:36.695
Yes! Yes!

36:36.796 --> 36:38.297
Japan, yeah.

36:38.898 --> 36:41.400
But I have to leave
Mom and Claire.

36:41.652 --> 36:43.802
On the other hand,
I could see Dad.

36:43.854 --> 36:45.003
Daddy!

36:45.203 --> 36:46.452
Daddy!

36:46.554 --> 36:48.055
Japan. Japan.

36:49.106 --> 36:50.807
But where is Japan?

36:50.859 --> 36:52.008
Ooh!

37:03.130 --> 37:05.131
That's delicious.

37:05.632 --> 37:07.633
I'm hungry.

37:16.149 --> 37:17.399
You know,

37:18.651 --> 37:20.453
if Tromaville's here,

37:21.053 --> 37:22.903
and Alaska's here,

37:23.255 --> 37:25.858
and Japan's
all the way over here,

37:26.058 --> 37:27.510
then I'm going to
have to travel

37:27.562 --> 37:30.062
over these big
beautiful mountains.

37:31.195 --> 37:33.447
Wow.
That's really far.

37:33.499 --> 37:35.699
I think
that's even farther

37:35.799 --> 37:37.501
than Tromaville
is to New York.

37:38.301 --> 37:41.604
Claire, I don't
want to leave you.

37:42.256 --> 37:43.554
Oh, but, Melvin,

37:43.978 --> 37:45.980
I think
your doctor's right.

37:46.480 --> 37:48.982
If you don't go to Japan
and find your daddy,

37:49.283 --> 37:51.032
you'll never be happy.

37:51.684 --> 37:53.886
Don't worry
about me, Melvin.

37:54.615 --> 37:56.113
I'll be all right.

37:56.165 --> 37:58.867
I'd be here
loving you the whole time.

37:59.019 --> 38:00.569
Remember, Melvin,

38:00.921 --> 38:02.270
I love you.

38:02.422 --> 38:03.571
Grrr!

38:05.573 --> 38:07.574
How could you
be so sure?

38:07.626 --> 38:09.576
Oh, well,

38:09.876 --> 38:13.379
My skin tingles all over
whenever I'm near you,

38:13.580 --> 38:16.582
and I get
little hot sensations

38:17.134 --> 38:18.783
all over my body.

38:19.184 --> 38:22.133
And sometimes,
my mouth gets dry.

38:22.185 --> 38:25.489
That could just be
a biochemical reflex.

38:25.641 --> 38:27.090
Oh, no, Melvin.

38:27.892 --> 38:33.295
Sometimes I see
little electric flashes

38:33.347 --> 38:36.298
that light up
the darkness.

38:36.850 --> 38:39.049
It's love, believe me.

38:39.101 --> 38:41.503
Now, stop worrying
about me, Melvin.

38:42.117 --> 38:44.319
It's our last day
together for a long while.

38:44.471 --> 38:46.022
What do you
want to do?

39:05.049 --> 39:07.050
Ooh! Oh!

39:32.470 --> 39:33.721
Ha ha ha!

39:33.773 --> 39:35.173
Grrr!

39:36.065 --> 39:38.014
I was in such a hurry
to get to my father

39:38.066 --> 39:41.168
that I bypassed the regularly
scheduled airlines

39:41.269 --> 39:46.373
and took the fastest mode
of transportation to Japan.

40:01.340 --> 40:03.643
At first I found it
hard to believe

40:03.695 --> 40:05.593
that my dad was japanese

40:05.710 --> 40:08.212
and that
I was part japanese.

40:08.664 --> 40:10.062
But that would explain

40:10.063 --> 40:13.365
why I've always had these
strange, nonamerican urges

40:13.368 --> 40:16.844
to work very hard,
save money,

40:16.896 --> 40:19.621
and live
without credit cards.

40:22.123 --> 40:25.126
Mommy and Claire were worried
that I didn't prepare properly

40:25.128 --> 40:27.026
for my trip to Tokyo,

40:27.028 --> 40:29.729
but I bought a book
of japanese phrases

40:29.781 --> 40:32.331
and rented a tape
of gidget goes to Tokyo.

40:32.583 --> 40:35.534
What more did I need?

40:45.266 --> 40:48.770
There was one little boo-boo
in my travel plans.

40:48.956 --> 40:50.353
I forget my passport,

40:51.513 --> 40:53.515
so when I got
to the Tokyo Harbor,

40:53.567 --> 40:55.965
I ditched my windsurf board

40:56.017 --> 40:59.320
and entered Tokyo
godzilla-style.

41:29.845 --> 41:33.747
Grrr!

41:47.660 --> 41:49.962
Grrr! Grrr!

41:54.494 --> 41:57.045
Am I in Paris or Tokyo?

41:57.046 --> 41:58.072
Let's see.

41:58.097 --> 42:00.600
Was I supposed to take
a left at the Panama Canal

42:00.652 --> 42:02.027
or a right?

42:03.079 --> 42:04.302
I don't know.

42:05.502 --> 42:07.504
Let me start
looking for my father.

42:46.819 --> 42:49.371
Because I couldn't speak
japanese that well,

42:49.623 --> 42:52.323
a waiter back at
the Tromaville Sushi Bar

42:52.424 --> 42:53.722
gave me a napkin

42:53.825 --> 42:56.227
with my father's name
written in japanese

42:56.228 --> 42:58.830
so people could help me
find my father.

43:08.837 --> 43:10.038
Grrr!

43:22.267 --> 43:23.768
Yoo hoo! Guys!

43:23.769 --> 43:26.871
Do you know where I could find
Mr. Mac Junko?

44:35.327 --> 44:36.578
Grrr!

44:38.077 --> 44:40.327
Even though
I was far from home,

44:40.379 --> 44:42.581
I kept up
all the good personal habits

44:42.633 --> 44:44.383
my mom had taught me.

44:58.494 --> 45:01.697
And so I continued
my search for my father.

46:11.026 --> 46:12.227
Hi.

46:13.728 --> 46:15.030
Thanks.

46:21.034 --> 46:23.437
Hmm. Those look good.
Can I have one?

46:24.289 --> 46:25.587
What are they?

46:25.839 --> 46:28.941
Very popular japanese snack
called Taiyaki.

46:28.993 --> 46:30.742
In shape of fish.

46:36.547 --> 46:37.548
Ah.

46:40.351 --> 46:41.352
Ah.

46:44.054 --> 46:45.054
Mmm.

46:45.155 --> 46:46.556
Mmm!

47:08.874 --> 47:11.325
As I was munching
on my delicious Taiyaki,

47:11.377 --> 47:14.277
suddenly my Tromations
began going Berserk.

47:18.082 --> 47:21.585
My body was reacting
to the presence of evil.

47:45.104 --> 47:46.605
Grrr!

47:57.414 --> 47:59.916
Oh, genki desu ka, guys?

48:00.417 --> 48:01.918
- Aah!
- Aah!

48:02.318 --> 48:03.819
Aah!

48:04.420 --> 48:05.921
Rrrr!

48:10.125 --> 48:11.676
Would you
hold this, ma'am?

48:11.678 --> 48:13.578
My Tromatons
are acting up.

48:14.255 --> 48:15.730
Here.

48:15.982 --> 48:17.405
Grrr!

50:07.797 --> 50:08.997
Aah!

50:38.422 --> 50:39.923
Aaah!

50:42.625 --> 50:44.627
Ita Nakimas.

50:51.832 --> 50:52.882
Sumi masen.

50:52.934 --> 50:54.035
Sumi masen, ladies.

50:54.087 --> 50:55.537
Uh, sumi masen.

51:14.568 --> 51:16.070
Shabu! Shabu!

51:16.122 --> 51:18.086
No deki agari.

51:18.438 --> 51:20.740
I've got
japanese shabu shabu here,

51:20.740 --> 51:22.242
heavy on the veggies.

51:33.150 --> 51:34.651
Grrr!

52:08.780 --> 52:10.281
Aah!

52:26.284 --> 52:28.285
Fist lesson in electronics.

52:39.295 --> 52:42.998
Your going to be first
human transmitter.

52:46.200 --> 52:47.701
Shh!

53:17.626 --> 53:19.127
She's all yours.

53:28.229 --> 53:29.278
Many thanks.

53:31.282 --> 53:34.685
I'm forever
in your debt, kind sir.

53:35.537 --> 53:36.838
Don't call me sir.

53:36.888 --> 53:39.791
My name is Melvin.
Call me Melvin.

53:40.250 --> 53:41.750
I am Masami.

53:42.151 --> 53:43.652
Hajima mashita.

53:45.756 --> 53:49.060
You put yourself
in terrible danger.

53:49.883 --> 53:52.185
Not many men
would do that.

53:52.533 --> 53:54.236
Well, actually,
I can't help it.

53:54.288 --> 53:55.484
What?

53:55.513 --> 53:58.517
I have these biochemical
particles in my body

53:58.519 --> 53:59.977
called Tromatons.

54:00.001 --> 54:02.201
So che è difficile da capire, ma

54:02.364 --> 54:04.265
I had an accident
a while back.

54:04.317 --> 54:06.567
It affected
my biochemical makeup.

54:07.126 --> 54:09.352
Every time
I sense evil,

54:09.704 --> 54:11.878
these Tromatons
inside me

54:12.078 --> 54:14.080
force me
to destroy it.

54:15.925 --> 54:19.328
Still, I must
repay you for saving me.

54:20.080 --> 54:22.931
I will do
whatever you wish.

54:23.783 --> 54:25.008
Hmm?

54:25.260 --> 54:26.333
Hey!

54:27.468 --> 54:29.670
How about helping me
find my father?

54:30.022 --> 54:31.520
Big Mac Junko.

54:31.672 --> 54:35.475
Come. I have
many contacts on the street.

54:38.134 --> 54:41.637
Masami and I searched
all over Tokyo for my father.

54:42.240 --> 54:43.289
Grrr!

54:44.033 --> 54:46.935
Let's go ask that
street-smart youth gang.

54:47.028 --> 54:48.353
Maybe they know.

54:48.931 --> 54:50.205
She introduced me

54:50.287 --> 54:52.990
to all the tough
and savvy street people.

54:53.501 --> 54:56.451
Do you know
Mr. Big Mac Junko?

55:12.905 --> 55:14.855
Tokyo, like Tromaville,

55:14.907 --> 55:16.808
was also
a nice place to live.

55:17.309 --> 55:19.711
The people had many
interesting activities,

55:19.712 --> 55:21.410
Like dancing
in the streets.

55:22.013 --> 55:25.215
We didn't have much luck
finding my father.

55:25.716 --> 55:27.817
I really started
to get bummed out.

55:28.911 --> 55:31.261
The people of Tokyo
were terrific.

55:31.688 --> 55:34.038
They did everything they could
to cheer me up.

55:34.773 --> 55:38.577
I put on a happy face
and tried my best to have fun.

56:15.382 --> 56:16.631
I'm hungry.

56:17.547 --> 56:18.849
Oh, that looks good.

56:19.680 --> 56:20.929
Here. Hold my mop.

56:21.780 --> 56:23.582
You wait here.
I'll be right out.

56:31.570 --> 56:33.071
Grrr!

56:42.710 --> 56:44.813
Come on, follow me.
Mmm.

56:46.658 --> 56:49.346
The plastic noodles
made my stomach full

56:49.385 --> 56:53.090
but without my father
my life would never be full.

56:58.893 --> 57:01.996
Do not be so sad,
Mr. Melvin.

57:05.222 --> 57:07.124
We will find your
father.

57:08.204 --> 57:12.207
I know. I know we will
but as if things weren't

57:12.256 --> 57:16.133
bad enough already
all these people they

57:16.135 --> 57:20.060
keep staring at me.
I feel so out of place.

57:22.511 --> 57:25.314
No problem.
Come with me.

57:31.020 --> 57:32.020
Pheww.

57:43.988 --> 57:45.438
Masami disguised me

57:45.439 --> 57:49.143
so I looked exactly like
a Typical Japanese Businessman.

57:49.666 --> 57:51.564
Now I really fit right in.

57:51.636 --> 57:53.787
I felt so much
more comfortable.

57:54.639 --> 57:57.791
I looked and smelled
so professional,

57:57.943 --> 58:00.343
I was sure Dad would be
real proud of me

58:00.795 --> 58:02.546
if I could only locate him.

58:09.151 --> 58:11.601
Meanwhile,
back in Tromaville,

58:11.653 --> 58:14.555
the Chairman and his evil
Corporate Henchmen

58:14.655 --> 58:17.057
were taking advantage
of my absence.

58:17.158 --> 58:20.159
Apocalypse Incorporated
moved back into Tromaville

58:20.411 --> 58:21.709
and systematically

58:21.710 --> 58:23.812
began spreading
its Chemical Pollution

58:23.863 --> 58:25.764
all over the entire town.

58:28.366 --> 58:29.815
Let's make use

58:29.867 --> 58:31.970
of our newly acquired
property in Tromaville

58:32.022 --> 58:35.048
to expand
our takeover project.

58:35.750 --> 58:38.375
I believe you all
have work to do.

58:44.590 --> 58:47.645
In a display
of incredibly evil arrogance,

58:47.650 --> 58:49.147
the name of our town

58:49.184 --> 58:53.034
was changed from Tromaville
to Apocalypseville,

58:53.186 --> 58:56.689
And the people were helpless
to do anything about it.

58:57.293 --> 58:59.245
Without me there
to fight evil,

58:59.346 --> 59:01.023
Apocalypse Incorporated

59:01.024 --> 59:03.675
was able to take over
all walks of life.

59:04.176 --> 59:07.179
They took control of
Tromaville's industrial life.

59:08.099 --> 59:09.248
Much worse,

59:09.300 --> 59:12.302
they took control over
Tromaville's cultural life.

59:13.068 --> 59:15.519
The little people
of Tromaville were miserable.

59:15.557 --> 59:16.755
How was I to know?

59:16.757 --> 59:18.406
I was 10,000 miles away

59:18.408 --> 59:20.961
in a land where
they eat plastic noodles.

59:21.445 --> 59:23.847
The Tromavillians tried
to protect their town

59:23.867 --> 59:25.865
from the Chemical Assault,

59:25.917 --> 59:29.717
but they were powerless against
the Chairman and his goons.

59:29.841 --> 59:31.418
People of Tromaville.

59:32.219 --> 59:33.768
You can't run away
from Chemicals

59:33.769 --> 59:35.771
with though running away
from yourselves.

59:36.616 --> 59:40.619
I say,
let's give back to nature

59:40.826 --> 59:42.976
what came from nature.

59:43.177 --> 59:48.681
Let's put back into the air
and the water and the earth

59:49.127 --> 59:50.925
All the chemicals-

59:50.934 --> 59:55.237
The fluorocarbons,
the DDT, the Dioxin

59:55.289 --> 59:59.088
that lay there
for centuries undisturbed

59:59.140 --> 01:00:03.245
before there was man
to come and pluck them out

01:00:03.745 --> 01:00:05.896
and use them
for his own purposes.

01:00:07.285 --> 01:00:10.787
The little people of Tromaville
bravely tried to stand tall.

01:00:10.851 --> 01:00:12.052
They could do nothing

01:00:12.052 --> 01:00:14.654
against the running dogs
of big business.

01:00:15.855 --> 01:00:16.955
Protest Rally!

01:00:16.956 --> 01:00:19.779
Help us stop the Apocalypse Corporation,
now!

01:00:20.203 --> 01:00:23.038
Everybody, there's a big meeting tonight.
Help us to find a solution.

01:00:23.573 --> 01:00:24.744
The Apocalypse
Corporation

01:00:24.762 --> 01:00:27.012
is building a Chemical Plant
in our park.

01:00:27.264 --> 01:00:29.266
Help us get ride of
the Apocalypse Corporation!

01:00:29.290 --> 01:00:31.617
They want to building a Chemical Plant
in our park.

01:00:31.718 --> 01:00:32.816
Stop Apocalypse!

01:00:32.868 --> 01:00:34.069
Help us
get rid of them!

01:00:34.090 --> 01:00:35.840
Please, keep
your neighborhood safe.

01:00:35.972 --> 01:00:38.174
Stop Apocalypse from
building a Chemical Plant.

01:00:38.174 --> 01:00:40.476
Fight the Apocalypse
Corportation.

01:00:41.424 --> 01:00:43.623
Everybody,
the Apocalypse Corporation

01:00:43.679 --> 01:00:45.981
wants to put a Chemical Plant
here in your park!

01:00:46.005 --> 01:00:47.505
Help us of stop him.

01:00:55.788 --> 01:00:58.290
Some gutsy people
tried to resist,

01:00:58.342 --> 01:01:00.240
but without me there,

01:01:00.292 --> 01:01:02.594
All efforts
proved hopeless.

01:01:04.911 --> 01:01:07.813
This park
is condemned, kid.

01:01:07.850 --> 01:01:09.425
You can't
condemn a park.

01:01:09.477 --> 01:01:11.149
Oh, yeah?
Just watch us.

01:01:11.801 --> 01:01:13.503
That be your horse
over there?

01:01:13.555 --> 01:01:15.205
Yeah.
No pollution.

01:01:16.757 --> 01:01:17.805
Peace.

01:01:17.990 --> 01:01:19.991
Well, that's
the next to go.

01:01:26.313 --> 01:01:28.315
What's that smell?

01:01:28.367 --> 01:01:29.416
Addicts!

01:01:29.816 --> 01:01:31.818
You see
what they're smoking?

01:01:31.918 --> 01:01:32.967
They're smoking crap.

01:01:33.319 --> 01:01:35.721
Right.
They're crap addicts.

01:01:35.721 --> 01:01:39.024
We won't let this Apocalypse
Corporation stop us.

01:01:39.076 --> 01:01:40.525
Meet you back here later.

01:01:40.788 --> 01:01:42.738
Walk on. Walk on.

01:01:52.198 --> 01:01:54.348
And those forthright
Tromavillians

01:01:54.435 --> 01:01:57.239
that Apocalypse Incorporated
couldn't control,

01:01:57.791 --> 01:01:59.240
they crushed.

01:02:19.057 --> 01:02:21.277
We never had drugs
in Tromaville

01:02:21.279 --> 01:02:24.081
before this Apocalypse
Corporation moved in.

01:02:24.082 --> 01:02:26.031
We're alone
in our place now.

01:02:26.063 --> 01:02:27.564
They can't
get us here.

01:02:51.303 --> 01:02:53.053
We did a good job,
eh, boss?

01:02:53.085 --> 01:02:56.988
Not bad. Could have
been a bit more violent.

01:02:57.140 --> 01:02:59.090
Can we get
a promotion now, boss?

01:02:59.090 --> 01:03:00.591
Huh? Huh? Huh?

01:03:02.143 --> 01:03:03.545
Yeah, maybe. Maybe.

01:03:03.694 --> 01:03:06.396
In fact, I'm looking for a couple
of executive types

01:03:06.396 --> 01:03:07.397
like yourselves

01:03:07.986 --> 01:03:10.439
to help turn
the Tromaville Bird Sanctuary

01:03:10.552 --> 01:03:12.001
into a fluorocarbon plant.

01:03:31.395 --> 01:03:34.298
Mom, who are
these people?

01:03:37.622 --> 01:03:40.725
Oh, please. This park
is our home.

01:03:40.777 --> 01:03:43.503
Can't you please
help the homeless?

01:03:43.555 --> 01:03:45.930
Can't you please
lend us a buck?

01:03:47.063 --> 01:03:49.564
"Neither a borrower
nor a lender be. "

01:03:49.784 --> 01:03:50.833
Shakespeare.

01:03:51.633 --> 01:03:54.635
"Fuck you. "
David Mamet.

01:04:00.013 --> 01:04:02.165
Masami and I
got our big break

01:04:02.166 --> 01:04:05.068
when we were directed
to the Skiji Fish Market.

01:04:06.497 --> 01:04:08.996
Well. This is it.

01:04:09.148 --> 01:04:10.899
Your father
is here, Melvin.

01:04:11.251 --> 01:04:13.452
I know it's hard
to believe.

01:04:13.454 --> 01:04:16.004
Here?
In the Fish Market?

01:04:16.506 --> 01:04:17.903
Wow!

01:04:19.203 --> 01:04:20.653
We were told that my father

01:04:20.657 --> 01:04:22.559
worked somewhere
in that neighborhood.

01:04:29.062 --> 01:04:30.611
The Skiji Fish Market

01:04:30.665 --> 01:04:33.115
was some
big-scale operation.

01:04:33.167 --> 01:04:35.770
There were more smelly
dead fish in there

01:04:35.822 --> 01:04:36.919
than there were

01:04:37.071 --> 01:04:39.172
in the Tromaville
City Council.

01:04:39.473 --> 01:04:42.275
The fact that my father
worked with fish

01:04:42.275 --> 01:04:44.125
and probably
had to wash his hands

01:04:44.178 --> 01:04:45.878
16 times a day

01:04:46.578 --> 01:04:49.281
made me even more
curious about him.

01:04:49.832 --> 01:04:51.581
What does
he look like?

01:04:51.883 --> 01:04:53.785
Did you find anything else out
about him?

01:04:53.837 --> 01:04:54.934
Where is he?

01:04:54.936 --> 01:04:56.786
Is he big or small?

01:04:57.375 --> 01:04:59.077
No one wants
to talk much

01:04:59.090 --> 01:05:00.540
about Mac Junko,

01:05:01.687 --> 01:05:07.091
only that he is
called Big Mac.

01:05:07.496 --> 01:05:08.897
Big Mac.

01:05:09.098 --> 01:05:11.048
My dad Big Mac.

01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:13.301
Well, let's find him.

01:05:15.002 --> 01:05:16.251
One of the fish cutters

01:05:16.252 --> 01:05:18.254
told us that Big Mac
could be found

01:05:18.254 --> 01:05:20.260
on the Skutajima
Fishing Bridge

01:05:20.335 --> 01:05:22.610
right behind
the Skiji Fish Market,

01:05:22.612 --> 01:05:24.161
where the fish boats dock.

01:05:24.284 --> 01:05:26.785
This was where
he ran his fish business.

01:05:27.141 --> 01:05:30.391
Finally, i was going to be
reunited with my father.

01:05:31.219 --> 01:05:33.321
I was overcome with Joy.

01:05:33.322 --> 01:05:37.225
What a beautiful moment
for a loving son.

01:05:54.835 --> 01:05:56.637
Melvin.
Look over there.

01:05:59.239 --> 01:06:01.040
It's him!
It's really him!

01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:03.041
My father, finally!

01:06:03.493 --> 01:06:05.143
My search is over.

01:06:05.144 --> 01:06:07.646
Oh, he looks
like a Big Teddy Bear.

01:06:08.046 --> 01:06:09.547
I love him already!

01:06:09.848 --> 01:06:12.249
Dad! It's me, Melvin!

01:06:12.601 --> 01:06:13.670
Daddy!

01:06:16.253 --> 01:06:17.454
Melvin!

01:06:18.254 --> 01:06:20.657
My boy! My son!

01:06:25.550 --> 01:06:26.751
Come here.

01:06:26.861 --> 01:06:30.864
Suddenly, there he was-
my long-lost father.

01:06:31.116 --> 01:06:35.068
This was to be the greatest
moment of my life.

01:06:35.220 --> 01:06:39.071
I couldn't wait
to hold him in my arms.

01:06:45.900 --> 01:06:49.252
As I joyfully embraced
my long-lost dad,

01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:53.783
suddenly my Tromatons went
into a horrendous reaction.

01:06:53.835 --> 01:06:55.685
There was evil present,

01:06:55.985 --> 01:07:00.487
and horror of horrors,
that evil was my father.

01:07:24.361 --> 01:07:25.361
Cocaine!

01:07:25.710 --> 01:07:28.612
He is smuggling
cocaine in fish!

01:07:28.664 --> 01:07:29.713
Cocaine!

01:07:33.316 --> 01:07:35.818
He is smuggling
cocaine in fish!

01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:40.070
Grr! Grr!

01:07:40.122 --> 01:07:43.072
Grr! Grr!
Grr! Grr!

01:07:43.791 --> 01:07:45.741
It was at that very moment

01:07:45.742 --> 01:07:47.994
that I learned what it was
to plunge

01:07:48.030 --> 01:07:50.230
from the heady heights
of ecstasy

01:07:50.230 --> 01:07:53.233
to the dismal depths
of despair.

01:07:53.785 --> 01:07:57.136
My long-lost dad
was a bum.

01:07:58.288 --> 01:07:59.737
Let's get that guy

01:07:59.737 --> 01:08:01.540
even if he is my dad.

01:08:02.140 --> 01:08:03.589
- Aah!
- Aah!

01:08:03.641 --> 01:08:05.141
We followed my father

01:08:05.143 --> 01:08:07.544
around the block
to his headquarters

01:08:07.696 --> 01:08:10.147
at the Fisherman's Shrine.

01:08:12.701 --> 01:08:13.749
I can't believe it!

01:08:14.249 --> 01:08:16.500
My own father
smuggling drugs!

01:08:16.952 --> 01:08:22.957
Oh, it's only a small part
of my business,

01:08:23.357 --> 01:08:28.862
only a bit better
than the white-slave trade.

01:08:28.862 --> 01:08:30.059
Ha ha ha!

01:08:30.263 --> 01:08:31.613
White-slave trade,
too?

01:08:32.665 --> 01:08:34.667
Smuggling drugs,
with slavery-

01:08:34.719 --> 01:08:36.167
Shut up!

01:08:43.466 --> 01:08:44.917
You jerk!
You hit Masami!

01:08:45.274 --> 01:08:47.225
Are you OK?
Are you all right?

01:08:47.278 --> 01:08:51.081
Don't you want to see
my greatest accomplishment?

01:08:54.142 --> 01:08:55.693
It was bad enough to discover

01:08:55.694 --> 01:08:58.145
that my father
was a drug smuggler,

01:08:58.187 --> 01:09:02.491
but even worse, I found out
he smoked cheap, smelly cigers.

01:09:04.010 --> 01:09:06.661
This, my boy,
is that we are doing

01:09:06.694 --> 01:09:09.042
in a lousy fish market-

01:09:10.194 --> 01:09:15.600
collecting fish oils to be used
in the production of...

01:09:16.807 --> 01:09:18.809
Antitromaton.

01:09:19.055 --> 01:09:20.505
Grr!

01:09:20.571 --> 01:09:23.073
There is enough anti-tromation

01:09:23.589 --> 01:09:24.950
in there

01:09:25.059 --> 01:09:27.756
to cause a chain reaction

01:09:27.809 --> 01:09:30.613
that will actually
change the nucleir

01:09:30.813 --> 01:09:34.015
of those toxic particles
of yours,

01:09:34.216 --> 01:09:37.667
breaking down the elements
of your body

01:09:38.219 --> 01:09:42.223
and turning you
into a harmless puddle of...

01:09:44.024 --> 01:09:45.024
Well...

01:09:45.725 --> 01:09:49.028
we don't quite know yet...

01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:50.176
do we?

01:09:51.111 --> 01:09:55.916
But first my boys
want to play with you.

01:10:02.041 --> 01:10:04.491
Run, Melvin! Run, Melvin!
Run, Melvin!

01:10:04.641 --> 01:10:07.043
Don't worry. Don't worry.
I can handle this.

01:10:07.795 --> 01:10:09.445
All right. guys!

01:10:09.846 --> 01:10:11.247
Banzai!

01:10:17.752 --> 01:10:18.753
Bonsai.

01:10:42.773 --> 01:10:44.273
Aah!

01:10:46.275 --> 01:10:47.276
Grr!

01:10:50.779 --> 01:10:52.280
Grr! Grr!

01:11:39.931 --> 01:11:41.032
Big Mac!

01:11:41.033 --> 01:11:42.234
Where are you?

01:11:43.323 --> 01:11:44.323
Grr!

01:11:45.324 --> 01:11:46.525
Whoa!

01:11:47.026 --> 01:11:48.527
- Grr!
- Ahh!

01:11:50.427 --> 01:11:51.428
Grr!

01:11:52.029 --> 01:11:53.530
Ahh!

01:12:00.437 --> 01:12:02.238
Hehehehe.

01:12:06.341 --> 01:12:07.842
- Aha!
- Grr!

01:12:07.894 --> 01:12:09.344
- Ahh!
- Grr!

01:12:10.345 --> 01:12:11.346
Ahh!

01:12:30.361 --> 01:12:32.863
Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!

01:12:45.074 --> 01:12:46.975
Oh, nice.

01:12:49.177 --> 01:12:50.178
Grr!

01:12:51.979 --> 01:12:53.180
Come on.

01:12:57.384 --> 01:12:58.885
Ah, yahh!

01:13:01.387 --> 01:13:02.388
Grr!

01:13:07.490 --> 01:13:08.991
Aaaaaaaaaah!

01:13:28.409 --> 01:13:30.411
- Ahh!
- Grr!

01:13:32.613 --> 01:13:34.615
- Ahh!
- Grr!

01:13:37.915 --> 01:13:39.915
Come on, come on.

01:13:41.660 --> 01:13:43.161
Grr!

01:14:09.456 --> 01:14:11.858
Come on, come on.
Let's get out of here.

01:14:12.021 --> 01:14:13.971
Oh, No!
It's Kabuki-man!

01:14:19.751 --> 01:14:21.253
I'll be right back.

01:14:38.467 --> 01:14:39.968
Hey!

01:14:40.469 --> 01:14:41.470
En garde!

01:15:12.996 --> 01:15:13.996
Heya!

01:15:56.031 --> 01:15:57.732
Aah!

01:17:05.581 --> 01:17:07.082
Grr! Grr!

01:17:10.793 --> 01:17:12.094
Eeyah!

01:17:15.175 --> 01:17:16.676
Aah!

01:17:30.209 --> 01:17:31.209
Aah!

01:17:42.119 --> 01:17:45.121
Aah! Aah! Aah!

01:18:35.307 --> 01:18:36.308
Grr!

01:18:37.999 --> 01:18:39.500
Melvin, my boy...

01:18:41.130 --> 01:18:45.634
I'd like you to meet
one of our accidents.

01:18:46.024 --> 01:18:48.922
in developing
anti-tromaton.

01:18:50.455 --> 01:18:54.458
He's a handsome fellow,
isn't he, Toxie?

01:19:42.484 --> 01:19:44.485
Sashini anyone?

01:19:45.220 --> 01:19:48.223
Grr! Grr! Grr!

01:19:51.593 --> 01:19:54.374
Don't you know
who you're dealing with?

01:19:54.378 --> 01:19:55.826
You can't win...

01:19:57.030 --> 01:19:59.731
Smelvin!

01:19:59.783 --> 01:20:00.933
Smelvin?

01:20:00.933 --> 01:20:02.282
Don't call me
Smelvin!

01:20:02.334 --> 01:20:04.836
My name is Melvin!
Call me Melvin!

01:20:06.071 --> 01:20:08.469
Psychologically,
I felt uncomfortable

01:20:08.469 --> 01:20:10.971
about the possibility
of fighting my own father.

01:20:11.822 --> 01:20:13.521
I felt even more uncomfortable

01:20:13.543 --> 01:20:16.645
when my father suddenly began
taking his clothes off,

01:20:17.335 --> 01:20:19.437
then he started
futzing with his hair,

01:20:19.499 --> 01:20:21.597
and before I could say
sigmund freud,

01:20:21.649 --> 01:20:25.052
my father put on this-
this- this diaper!

01:20:25.104 --> 01:20:27.255
To see my own father
in a diaper...

01:20:27.307 --> 01:20:31.158
Whoa! What a Toxic head-trip!

01:20:31.310 --> 01:20:34.787
I am the Big Mac.

01:20:35.925 --> 01:20:39.350
I am the Big Cheese.

01:20:40.666 --> 01:20:47.771
You might say that I am the
Big Mac with cheese.

01:20:47.823 --> 01:20:48.872
Heh heh heh!

01:20:53.676 --> 01:20:55.178
Grr! Grr!

01:21:30.123 --> 01:21:31.224
Okey-dokey.

01:21:31.359 --> 01:21:32.609
Oh, okey-dokey.

01:21:43.465 --> 01:21:45.015
And now...

01:21:45.110 --> 01:21:48.812
it's bedtime, Smelvin.

01:22:30.857 --> 01:22:32.859
Melvin! Melvin!

01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:00.531
Aaah!

01:23:01.382 --> 01:23:02.383
Aaah!

01:23:17.896 --> 01:23:20.346
Masami knew little
about anti-tromaton

01:23:20.598 --> 01:23:24.101
or its deleterious effects on
a hideously deformed creature

01:23:24.153 --> 01:23:27.652
of superhuman size
and strength like myself.

01:23:27.804 --> 01:23:31.808
But since my condition resulted
from a Sumo Situation,

01:23:32.074 --> 01:23:34.576
she wisely took me
to a Sumo Gym,

01:23:34.876 --> 01:23:36.474
where I was rehabilitated

01:23:36.513 --> 01:23:40.316
thanks to a program of ancient
Sumo Homeopatic Remedies,

01:23:40.980 --> 01:23:44.630
Sumo Philosophy,
and Sumo Physical Exercise.

01:23:45.607 --> 01:23:48.458
My name is
Shochikuyama.

01:23:57.228 --> 01:24:00.931
You must first learn
Purifying Ritual.

01:24:09.038 --> 01:24:14.142
First, we stamp out
the Evil Spirits.

01:24:23.150 --> 01:24:25.251
Then we gargle...

01:24:30.355 --> 01:24:32.357
the Power Water.

01:24:37.226 --> 01:24:39.027
And scatter...

01:24:42.465 --> 01:24:44.867
Purifying salt.

01:24:58.278 --> 01:25:01.480
The next step is Nintai-

01:25:01.532 --> 01:25:03.983
Patience and tolerance.

01:25:07.086 --> 01:25:10.136
If your opponent
is an equal,

01:25:10.488 --> 01:25:15.392
you must be sure
to make the first move.

01:25:28.065 --> 01:25:31.067
You have served mankind

01:25:31.157 --> 01:25:33.508
by killing Mac Junko.

01:25:34.008 --> 01:25:40.513
We offer you the Mawashi
and Sagari of our Heya.

01:25:43.077 --> 01:25:45.027
Oh, domo arigato.

01:25:45.116 --> 01:25:48.919
I thank you for your kindness
and your instruction,

01:25:49.471 --> 01:25:51.121
and you saved my life.

01:25:51.523 --> 01:25:54.525
But I killed
my own father,

01:25:54.577 --> 01:25:56.626
and I am unworthy.

01:25:58.324 --> 01:25:59.524
I will never forget you,

01:26:00.030 --> 01:26:02.031
but I must leave now.

01:26:02.741 --> 01:26:04.190
Sayonara.

01:26:12.022 --> 01:26:14.024
Good-bye, Melvin.

01:26:14.141 --> 01:26:16.142
I won't forget you.

01:26:16.194 --> 01:26:18.420
Sayonara, Masami.

01:26:18.472 --> 01:26:20.594
Kimi no kotowa.

01:26:20.646 --> 01:26:23.148
Isho wa suri nai,
Sayonara.

01:26:27.565 --> 01:26:29.066
Ah, let's see.

01:26:29.105 --> 01:26:30.554
Nintai...

01:26:30.555 --> 01:26:34.156
Patience and tolerance.

01:26:34.208 --> 01:26:36.284
Make the first move.

01:26:36.436 --> 01:26:38.649
Patience and tolerance.

01:26:38.701 --> 01:26:40.762
Make the first move.

01:26:45.313 --> 01:26:48.415
Back home, the boot-licking
bourgeois bullies

01:26:48.483 --> 01:26:51.310
of corporate corruption
had their way

01:26:51.310 --> 01:26:53.533
with the little people
of Tromaville.

01:26:54.300 --> 01:26:57.203
Apocalypse Incorporated
had little trouble

01:26:57.378 --> 01:26:59.679
attaining its goal
of total ownership

01:26:59.680 --> 01:27:02.581
of everything and everyone.

01:27:02.833 --> 01:27:03.882
Ughh!

01:27:03.882 --> 01:27:04.883
Aah!

01:27:17.608 --> 01:27:19.109
Mama!

01:27:27.874 --> 01:27:29.616
Drop that flowerpot!

01:27:30.387 --> 01:27:31.787
Heh heh heh!

01:27:49.425 --> 01:27:53.030
You can't take this church,
and you can't take our town!

01:27:53.175 --> 01:27:56.125
There are no leverage buyouts
in a house of God!

01:28:03.131 --> 01:28:06.034
Aw, are you hungry?
Would you like some french bread?

01:28:06.086 --> 01:28:07.735
It's fresh-baked-
Hey! Hey!

01:28:15.640 --> 01:28:17.142
Hey! Hey!
Cut it out!

01:28:17.594 --> 01:28:20.044
Ow! Ow!
Can you help us?

01:28:20.196 --> 01:28:22.146
Aah! Aah! Aah!

01:28:22.646 --> 01:28:24.148
Hey, what are you
guys doing?

01:28:24.149 --> 01:28:25.449
What do you think
you're doing?

01:28:25.650 --> 01:28:26.700
Aah!

01:28:26.752 --> 01:28:27.777
Hey!

01:28:27.829 --> 01:28:28.902
Oh!

01:28:29.353 --> 01:28:30.504
My leg!

01:28:30.656 --> 01:28:31.855
Huh?

01:28:36.358 --> 01:28:38.360
Ha ha ha!

01:28:43.160 --> 01:28:44.810
As I went back home,

01:28:44.862 --> 01:28:46.664
I could not
get over the fact

01:28:46.664 --> 01:28:48.866
that I had killed
my own father!

01:28:48.966 --> 01:28:51.968
I felt so guilty,
but I felt a lot worse

01:28:51.968 --> 01:28:54.821
when I saw
what Apocalypse Incorporated

01:28:54.873 --> 01:28:57.474
had done to Tromaville
in my absence.

01:29:25.243 --> 01:29:26.792
Oops! I almost forgot.

01:29:26.844 --> 01:29:28.546
I've got to sort the laundry.

01:29:49.407 --> 01:29:50.963
Who's that? Melvin?

01:29:50.988 --> 01:29:52.485
Melvin, are you back from Japan?

01:29:54.713 --> 01:29:56.714
Melvin?
Melvin, is that you?

01:29:57.366 --> 01:29:59.916
Melvin.
Melvin, is that you?

01:30:00.068 --> 01:30:01.818
Back from Japan?

01:30:02.615 --> 01:30:05.117
Melvin, your muscles feel-
They feel nice,

01:30:05.169 --> 01:30:06.894
but they feel
a little smaller.

01:30:07.146 --> 01:30:08.819
Melvin,
what happened to you?

01:30:08.920 --> 01:30:11.223
Have you been eating
that funny fish from Japan?

01:30:11.624 --> 01:30:13.874
That- That Sushi?

01:30:14.283 --> 01:30:16.884
Melvin, Melvin, why don't you
speak to me?

01:30:16.884 --> 01:30:18.086
I missed you so much.

01:30:20.098 --> 01:30:22.100
Hey, that's not you,
Melvin!

01:30:22.100 --> 01:30:23.301
Have a seat.

01:30:26.131 --> 01:30:27.380
We're the new guard,
honey.

01:30:27.432 --> 01:30:30.736
You could say we was moving in
on your territory.

01:30:31.688 --> 01:30:35.238
This is where she lives?
What a dump.

01:30:35.390 --> 01:30:37.788
Absolutely
fascinating.

01:30:38.782 --> 01:30:42.087
This place, it needs a lot
of work.

01:30:42.327 --> 01:30:44.725
And we're taking over.

01:30:45.762 --> 01:30:48.212
I've been waiting
and waiting

01:30:48.264 --> 01:30:50.867
to get a hold
of these yellow locks

01:30:50.919 --> 01:30:54.069
and these melon-heavy
breasts.

01:30:54.970 --> 01:30:56.419
- Woo!
- Woo!

01:30:56.571 --> 01:30:58.072
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!

01:31:01.875 --> 01:31:04.527
The bitch
broke my nail!

01:31:05.479 --> 01:31:07.780
Let me
kill her now, boss.

01:31:08.981 --> 01:31:12.622
Melvin!

01:31:13.584 --> 01:31:14.586
Melvin.

01:31:15.138 --> 01:31:16.536
Grrr.

01:31:16.888 --> 01:31:20.791
Whoa! I've got
a Toxic Explosive for you, baby.

01:31:23.294 --> 01:31:24.295
Melvin!

01:31:42.709 --> 01:31:44.210
Bad, bad girl!

01:31:49.815 --> 01:31:52.618
Melvin, let's talk
about this.

01:31:53.470 --> 01:31:55.319
I've been hurt!
Let's go!

01:31:55.471 --> 01:31:56.520
Melvin!

01:31:58.622 --> 01:31:59.824
Bitch!

01:32:12.533 --> 01:32:15.137
I'm going to break you in half
like a fucking wishbone.

01:32:15.289 --> 01:32:18.039
Get off of me,
you whore!

01:32:21.242 --> 01:32:24.090
You crazy bitch!

01:32:24.142 --> 01:32:27.945
You blind bimbo bitch!

01:32:29.348 --> 01:32:31.349
Look, Melvin,
I'm helping.

01:32:35.212 --> 01:32:36.263
Melvin.

01:32:36.315 --> 01:32:37.315
Claire.

01:32:38.315 --> 01:32:39.716
Oh, my Melvin.

01:32:40.317 --> 01:32:42.418
Nobody messes
with the bad girls.

01:32:45.321 --> 01:32:46.422
Oh, Melvin.

01:32:58.194 --> 01:33:02.547
But now Toxie was back home,
and I wasted no time.

01:33:03.099 --> 01:33:05.301
I immediately set about
cleaning up Tromaville.

01:33:06.239 --> 01:33:08.589
The good citizens rallied
to support me.

01:33:12.145 --> 01:33:13.193
Yeah!

01:33:28.648 --> 01:33:31.098
When the Chairman saw
that I was back

01:33:31.150 --> 01:33:34.152
and that his best-laid plans
had gone astray,

01:33:34.304 --> 01:33:37.355
he decided that
if he couldn't own Tromaville,

01:33:37.655 --> 01:33:40.658
then he was going to
destroy Tromaville.

01:33:41.158 --> 01:33:42.861
The evil Chairman Summoned

01:33:42.861 --> 01:33:45.563
his craziest
and most violent henchman-

01:33:46.215 --> 01:33:48.064
The Dark Rider.

01:33:49.993 --> 01:33:51.995
Ah ha ha ha ha ha!

01:33:52.595 --> 01:33:54.545
Ah ha ha ha ha!

01:33:54.997 --> 01:33:56.998
With 300 pounds
of Nitroglycerin

01:33:56.998 --> 01:33:58.299
strapped to his body,

01:33:58.500 --> 01:34:00.049
the Dark Rider was ordered

01:34:00.050 --> 01:34:02.852
to crash into the Tromaville
City Hall

01:34:02.855 --> 01:34:05.354
and blow the entire town
to Smithereens.

01:34:06.506 --> 01:34:10.010
If the Dark Rider succeeded
in blowing up Tromaville,

01:34:10.162 --> 01:34:14.112
Mom, Claire, and all my friends
would be killed.

01:34:15.064 --> 01:34:17.563
Even worse,
if Tromaville was destroyed,

01:34:18.215 --> 01:34:21.019
there would never be
a Toxic Avenger Part III.

01:34:21.471 --> 01:34:22.596
Stop!

01:34:23.348 --> 01:34:24.521
Oh!

01:34:26.153 --> 01:34:27.977
- Hey, what the- 
- Sorry about that, Cabby.

01:34:28.102 --> 01:34:29.580
I'm the Toxic Avenger.

01:34:32.151 --> 01:34:34.252
Ho-ho-holy shit.

01:34:34.952 --> 01:34:36.053
Now, let's get that guy.

01:34:38.305 --> 01:34:39.455
Look out.

01:34:41.257 --> 01:34:42.307
Senoir citizens.

01:34:42.559 --> 01:34:45.361
Pardon me, ma'am, sir.
I need your cab.

01:34:45.413 --> 01:34:47.713
Cabby,
I'm the Toxic Avenger.

01:34:47.713 --> 01:34:49.213
We must save Tromaville.

01:34:49.263 --> 01:34:51.215
Follow that villain
on the motorcycle

01:34:51.267 --> 01:34:54.268
and put the pedal to the metal.
Let's go!

01:34:56.187 --> 01:34:58.089
For this
I left the south bronx?

01:35:33.566 --> 01:35:35.468
I hope I get a good tip
out of this.

01:35:42.593 --> 01:35:43.744
Step on it, Cabby.

01:35:43.796 --> 01:35:44.896
He went that way.

01:35:45.648 --> 01:35:46.672
Hurry up!

01:35:46.824 --> 01:35:47.897
Step on it!

01:35:54.504 --> 01:35:55.504
Wait!

01:35:59.608 --> 01:36:02.610
Ah ah ah!

01:36:21.025 --> 01:36:24.629
Whoa!
Step on it, Cabby. Whoa!

01:36:31.134 --> 01:36:32.134
Whoa!

01:36:35.947 --> 01:36:37.849
I'll fix it later.

01:36:38.301 --> 01:36:39.350
Aah!

01:36:44.354 --> 01:36:45.803
Herman,
you dumb schmuck.

01:36:45.855 --> 01:36:48.158
We should have gone
to the french restaurant.

01:36:49.458 --> 01:36:52.560
Shut up, Sadie.
We're going chinese. It's cheaper.

01:36:52.761 --> 01:36:54.762
Some wedding
anniversary.

01:36:57.364 --> 01:36:58.615
Aah!

01:36:58.667 --> 01:36:59.867
Whoa!

01:37:05.053 --> 01:37:07.054
OK, kids.
Cross at the green.

01:37:07.106 --> 01:37:08.831
Now, kids. Wait.

01:37:08.883 --> 01:37:10.557
Hey, what the-

01:37:10.995 --> 01:37:12.995
No, no, no!
Slow down.

01:37:14.060 --> 01:37:16.062
No! Slow down!

01:37:21.265 --> 01:37:23.016
Well, ha ha ha.

01:37:23.068 --> 01:37:24.096
See, Jimmy?

01:37:24.721 --> 01:37:26.094
Safety first.

01:37:26.470 --> 01:37:27.671
I tell you.

01:37:58.496 --> 01:37:59.898
Oh, God.

01:38:09.006 --> 01:38:10.006
Come on, honey.

01:38:19.062 --> 01:38:21.263
50 year
anniversary.

01:38:21.763 --> 01:38:24.666
Some celebration-
with this thing.

01:38:29.970 --> 01:38:34.273
My mother shouldn't have made
a contact with you.

01:38:34.274 --> 01:38:35.322
You're stupid.

01:38:35.474 --> 01:38:37.776
Cut the yapping.
I'm trying to drive.

01:38:40.779 --> 01:38:42.781
Let's go!
Get that guy on the bike!

01:38:42.833 --> 01:38:43.882
Let's go!

01:38:54.032 --> 01:38:56.034
Whoa!

01:39:09.542 --> 01:39:10.944
What the...

01:39:29.319 --> 01:39:33.022
My car!
What did you do to my car?

01:39:38.673 --> 01:39:40.122
It's all right, Amigo.

01:39:40.174 --> 01:39:42.327
You just got yourself
a convertible.

01:39:43.479 --> 01:39:46.281
Hey, a convertible.
Customized, too.

01:39:46.333 --> 01:39:47.633
Here you go.
try these.

01:39:47.785 --> 01:39:48.983
Here.

01:39:49.652 --> 01:39:52.154
Get that guy on the bike.
Let's go!

01:39:52.506 --> 01:39:53.555
All right!

01:39:56.658 --> 01:40:01.161
Aaah!

01:40:01.662 --> 01:40:04.164
Stop him!
Aah!

01:40:04.664 --> 01:40:06.415
Aaah!

01:40:06.467 --> 01:40:08.167
Aah!

01:40:15.673 --> 01:40:18.676
Whee! Ah-ha!

01:40:23.180 --> 01:40:26.182
Aaah!

01:40:38.581 --> 01:40:40.530
Ha ha ha.

01:40:40.582 --> 01:40:42.084
# Doo-doo-doo-doo #

01:40:42.584 --> 01:40:44.033
# Di-da-da-da #

01:40:44.085 --> 01:40:46.535
# Do-da-da-da-da-da-da #

01:40:46.587 --> 01:40:49.037
Aiee, ow!
Enough of this Tromaville.

01:40:49.089 --> 01:40:52.292
I go back to south bronx,
where it's safe.

01:40:52.644 --> 01:40:55.094
Ah, ah, ah, eiee.

01:41:01.100 --> 01:41:05.051
Aaah!

01:41:05.603 --> 01:41:06.652
Look at that free!

01:41:06.704 --> 01:41:08.705
Oh, happy anniversary.
Happy anniversary.

01:41:12.009 --> 01:41:15.512
Sadie, we'll go
to the french restaurant.

01:41:15.712 --> 01:41:16.761
Oh, Herman,

01:41:16.761 --> 01:41:20.163
such an exciting 50th
wedding anniversary.

01:41:20.267 --> 01:41:23.718
Much more so than our honeymoon,
huh?

01:41:24.119 --> 01:41:25.267
Oh.

01:41:25.319 --> 01:41:30.024
Oy, oy, oy, oy.
I love you.

01:41:33.126 --> 01:41:35.127
Grrr.

01:42:01.950 --> 01:42:03.451
Grrr.

01:42:23.667 --> 01:42:24.668
Aaah!

01:42:36.078 --> 01:42:37.127
Yay!

01:42:37.179 --> 01:42:38.680
All right.

01:42:56.234 --> 01:42:59.836
Where am I?
What's going on?

01:43:00.088 --> 01:43:01.621
You're in Tromaville,

01:43:01.638 --> 01:43:04.440
and the Toxic Avenger
just saved our asses.

01:43:06.742 --> 01:43:08.744
So, you're
the Toxic Avenger.

01:43:09.244 --> 01:43:10.293
The one and only.

01:43:10.345 --> 01:43:13.248
It's hard to believe
you were my little Melvin.

01:43:13.300 --> 01:43:16.751
Big Mac!
I don't believe it.

01:43:16.803 --> 01:43:18.700
Mildred!
It's a miracle!

01:43:18.752 --> 01:43:22.956
I had given up faith that
I would ever find you again.

01:43:23.208 --> 01:43:24.305
Dad?

01:43:24.457 --> 01:43:26.959
If you're you,
who was that I killed in Japan?

01:43:27.311 --> 01:43:29.709
A big ugly guy?

01:43:29.761 --> 01:43:32.564
He was smuggling cocaine
inside of Tuna Fish.

01:43:32.916 --> 01:43:37.043
That's Big Mac Bunko, not Junko,
former con man.

01:43:37.395 --> 01:43:39.619
I've been mistaken for him
more than once.

01:43:39.971 --> 01:43:43.373
He's ruined my credit rating
with visa and mastercard.

01:43:43.973 --> 01:43:46.475
I'm glad to know
of his demise.

01:43:46.576 --> 01:43:49.578
Well, Dad,
glad to see you.

01:43:53.781 --> 01:43:56.283
And who is
this lovely young lady?

01:43:56.584 --> 01:43:59.586
Oh, this is
my girl, Claire.

01:43:59.838 --> 01:44:00.887
Daddy!

01:44:02.889 --> 01:44:03.938
Oh, Big Mac.

01:44:04.390 --> 01:44:07.042
I never want you
to wander again-ever.

01:44:07.094 --> 01:44:09.794
And I will stay here
with you, my love.

01:44:15.390 --> 01:44:18.793
So Mom and Claire
and my real Dad

01:44:18.795 --> 01:44:20.446
along with
all the Tromavillians

01:44:20.497 --> 01:44:23.600
were once again free
to enjoy life to the fullest,

01:44:24.949 --> 01:44:26.398
and the wicked Chairman-

01:44:26.599 --> 01:44:30.403
He fled Tromaville as fast as
his evil legs would carry him.

01:44:32.931 --> 01:44:36.908
Hey, want a ride?
Big business sucks, you wad.

01:44:36.960 --> 01:44:39.785
Now I could really feel good
about myself.

01:44:39.837 --> 01:44:42.736
My broken id
was finally repaired

01:44:42.995 --> 01:44:45.445
because I knew
that whenever or wherever

01:44:45.449 --> 01:44:47.899
the good citizens
of Tromaville needed help,

01:44:48.051 --> 01:44:49.801
they could always count on me.

01:44:50.484 --> 01:44:51.881
So just remember, folks,

01:44:51.933 --> 01:44:54.035
when the bad guys come
to your town,

01:44:54.087 --> 01:44:56.038
and you're not quite sure
what to do,

01:44:56.338 --> 01:44:59.140
call me,
the Toxic Avenger!
