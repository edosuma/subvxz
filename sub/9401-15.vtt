00:21.427 --> 00:22.760
Hey, brooke.
How you doing?

00:22.828 --> 00:26.096
Yeah, I'm just watching
a teamster paint my adolescence

00:26.164 --> 00:27.697
A fugly shade of brown.

00:27.765 --> 00:30.769
Oh. I guess there's a lot
of memories around here for you.

00:30.837 --> 00:32.387
You could say that.

00:32.455 --> 00:35.390
In high school,
this was lucas' bedroom.

00:36.688 --> 00:40.004
Mm. Now that
<i>that's</i> burned into my brain,

00:40.072 --> 00:43.273
How we, uh, doing on the
wardrobe choices for scene 23?

00:43.341 --> 00:44.848
The big love scene --

Slinky off-the-shoulder,
tight-and-revealing.

00:47.905 --> 00:48.239
Nice.

00:48.239 --> 00:50.552
I knew hiring you as costume
designer was the right move.

00:51.440 --> 00:52.449
Thank you.

00:52.653 --> 00:55.224
Let me see them on her
before I make a decision.

00:55.292 --> 00:57.482
So...[sighs]

00:57.550 --> 00:59.338
Speaking
of high school memories,

00:59.406 --> 01:01.794
Haley and quinn organized
that fundraiser dance

01:01.871 --> 01:03.314
At tree hill high
tonight.

01:03.382 --> 01:04.900
And I just wanted
to tell you

01:04.968 --> 01:07.153
In case you were thinking
it'd be weird to go.

01:07.220 --> 01:09.472
Not that you would.
But if you did...

01:09.540 --> 01:11.090
It wouldn't.

01:11.157 --> 01:13.541
Uh, thanks, but, you
know, we shoot our
first scenes tomorrow,

01:13.608 --> 01:14.923
And I got a million things
to do.

01:14.990 --> 01:17.038
Besides, you know what a geek
I was in high school.

01:17.106 --> 01:18.446
You've seen
my yearbook photo.

01:18.514 --> 01:20.728
Yeah, that's burned
into <i>my</i> brain.

01:20.796 --> 01:21.976
Exactly.

01:22.044 --> 01:24.958
The day I graduated,
I swore I'd never go back.

01:25.031 --> 01:27.445
You have fun, though.
I'll see you tomorrow.

Listen, the best way
to get over millie

02:56.355 --> 02:57.692
Is to get right back
on the horse --

02:57.760 --> 03:00.535
Preferably a hot, naked,
made-to-order horse.

03:00.603 --> 03:03.411

is describe your perfect woman.

Morning?

03:22.704 --> 03:24.006
Where the hell are we?

03:24.074 --> 03:26.414
We left that charity event
in atlanta early

03:26.482 --> 03:28.587
So we could make it back
to tree hill by morning.

03:28.655 --> 03:30.626
Yeah. Uh, right after
you fell asleep last night,

03:30.694 --> 03:31.863
It started raining.

03:31.930 --> 03:33.502
Yeah?

Really hard.
And?

03:35.373 --> 03:37.546
One might even call it
a deluge.

03:37.614 --> 03:38.683
Clay.

03:40.690 --> 03:42.025
I missed the highway exit

03:42.093 --> 03:45.436
And, uh, drove a few hours
in the wrong direction.

03:45.503 --> 03:47.006
But the good news is

03:47.073 --> 03:49.045
That we're only a couple hundred
miles outside of tree hill,

03:49.112 --> 03:50.450
And we're driving
a corvette.

03:50.517 --> 03:52.789

I had to be home this morning.

we put out pages?

talking to brooke earlier.

05:56.684 --> 05:58.817
She practically begged you
to go to that dance.

05:58.885 --> 06:00.285
Not quite.

06:00.353 --> 06:02.687
I think what she said was "it
wouldn't be weird" if I went.

06:02.755 --> 06:06.189
Trust me.
She wants you to go.

06:06.257 --> 06:08.325
I think she was just
being polite.

06:08.392 --> 06:11.461
It's -- it's been weird
between us since the breakup.

06:11.528 --> 06:13.796
And since when are you
so pro brooke-and-julian?

06:13.864 --> 06:15.665
Oh, I'm a total
"brulian" fan now.

06:15.732 --> 06:17.099
One of the steps
of recovery

06:17.167 --> 06:19.568
Is to make amends
for all the wrongs you've done.

06:19.635 --> 06:21.736
You still gonna have time
to be in the movie?

on holidays and stuff.

06:32.213 --> 06:33.280

of a new day.

have to leave early

06:42.189 --> 06:45.358
So junk and fergie are gonna
come over to babysit, okay?

06:45.425 --> 06:47.426
You only get those guys
when you can't find anyone else.

06:47.494 --> 06:48.727
That's not true.

06:48.795 --> 06:50.462
You have fun
with junk and fergie.

06:50.530 --> 06:52.630
Besides, the two of them
equals one responsible adult.

06:52.698 --> 06:54.165
I'm not a baby anymore.

06:54.233 --> 06:56.934
I'm old enough
to stay home by myself.
[ laughs ]

06:57.002 --> 06:59.603
And I'm old enough to get
arrested for child endangerment,

06:59.670 --> 07:01.538
Which would be my third strike,
by the way.

07:01.605 --> 07:02.872

07:10.146 --> 07:11.913
Oh, it's no big deal.

07:11.981 --> 07:13.448
Of course it is.

07:13.516 --> 07:15.082
Today's the day we rescue
the endangered arts program

07:15.150 --> 07:16.350
At tree hill high.

07:16.418 --> 07:18.119
What could be
bigger than that?

07:18.186 --> 07:19.587
I can't think of a thing.

07:19.654 --> 07:21.721
Since the theme of the dance
is "return to the '80s,"

07:21.789 --> 07:24.056
I get to fulfill
my lifelong dream --

07:24.124 --> 07:25.524
I'm crimping my hair.

07:25.592 --> 07:26.960
While that is very '80s,

07:27.028 --> 07:28.895
You may need to rethink
your life goals.

07:28.963 --> 07:30.096
Hmm.

07:30.164 --> 07:31.931
Listen, um, we might be
flying solo tonight.

07:31.998 --> 07:33.532
I got a message from nathan
and clay.

07:33.600 --> 07:35.433
It seems like they're having
some car trouble.

07:35.501 --> 07:37.669
Really? How much you want to bet
that's a ploy

07:37.736 --> 07:39.270
To get out
of wearing parachute pants?

07:40.605 --> 07:42.739
I'm gonna go crimp my hair.
[ giggles ]

07:42.807 --> 07:44.107
Yay.

07:48.278 --> 07:49.879
Yeesh.

07:49.947 --> 07:53.516
I'd like my margarita blended,
no salt.

07:53.583 --> 07:54.949
Ha ha.

07:55.017 --> 07:57.251
I'm thinking about wearing this
to the '80s dance

07:57.318 --> 07:58.652
At my high school tonight.

07:58.719 --> 08:00.220
Huh.
What a coincidence,

08:00.288 --> 08:02.055
'cause I actually learned
everything I know about fashion

08:02.123 --> 08:03.656
From "miami vice" reruns.

08:03.724 --> 08:04.891
[ laughs ]

08:04.958 --> 08:07.126
You were born
in the wrong decade, my friend.

08:07.194 --> 08:08.527
Yeah, perhaps.

08:08.594 --> 08:10.428
But I do make the perfect date
for an '80s dance.

08:10.496 --> 08:13.096
Yeah.

08:13.164 --> 08:15.564
And by "date,"

08:15.632 --> 08:18.500
I just mean a guy who wants
to go strictly as friends.

08:18.568 --> 08:19.768
Yeah, I...

08:19.836 --> 08:21.769
I'm just not sure
that's really a good idea.

08:21.837 --> 08:22.937
Come on.

08:23.004 --> 08:24.772
The best way
for me to meet a hot girl

08:24.839 --> 08:26.740
Is to have another one
on my arm.

08:26.808 --> 08:27.841
It's like a magnet.

08:29.978 --> 08:32.645
You'd be doing me
a favor.

08:33.847 --> 08:35.981
Okay.

08:36.049 --> 08:38.582
We will go as friends.

08:38.650 --> 08:40.551
Okay, cool.
I'll pick you up at 7:00.

08:40.619 --> 08:43.986
Oh, and by the way, for
the whole magnet thing to work,

08:44.054 --> 08:46.123
I'm gonna need you
to salvage that train wreck.

08:46.190 --> 08:47.957
Yeah.

08:59.299 --> 09:01.133
Quinn?

09:01.200 --> 09:02.434
Quinny,
are you up there?

09:02.501 --> 09:04.935
She's pimping her hair.

09:05.003 --> 09:06.603
I hope you mean
"crimping."

09:06.671 --> 09:09.138
Listen, I have to go
run some errands, okay?

09:09.206 --> 09:12.340
Please remind quinn to stay
until junk and fergie get here.

09:12.408 --> 09:13.274
Sure.

09:13.342 --> 09:14.541
Okay. Mwah.

09:14.609 --> 09:17.676
Love you, baby.
Have fun tonight.

09:17.743 --> 09:19.477
I will.

09:23.280 --> 09:24.980
Hey. Was your mom
looking for me?
Yeah.

09:25.048 --> 09:26.214
She wanted me to tell you

09:26.282 --> 09:28.015
That she's gonna pick up
junk and fergie,

09:28.083 --> 09:29.649
And you can leave whenever.

09:29.717 --> 09:32.118
Okay.

09:37.758 --> 09:39.391
Okay, little bro.

09:39.459 --> 09:41.160
No hard feelings.

09:41.228 --> 09:43.663
Believe that?
Jamie just cancelled on us.

09:43.731 --> 09:45.834
He said they went
another direction.

09:45.901 --> 09:48.206
That's cold, man.
Yeah.

09:48.274 --> 09:49.609
Where were we?

09:49.676 --> 09:50.676
Let's see.

09:50.744 --> 09:52.478
