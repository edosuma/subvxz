00:06.507 --> 00:08.998
(Choir on tape) J‘ City council, District C

00:09.135 --> 00:11.717
J‘ DJ Davis
(Davis) J‘ Vote for me

00:11.846 --> 00:13.711
J‘ We all have this feelin'

00:13.848 --> 00:15.338
(Davis) Ladies and gentlemen,

00:15.474 --> 00:22.061
DJ Davis in the hou—ou—ouse!

00:22.190 --> 00:24.932
Remember, Davis can save us.

00:25.067 --> 00:28.230
Watch the candidates' forum
tomorrow night on WYES.

00:28.362 --> 00:31.229
Remember my platform. Pot for potholes,

00:31.365 --> 00:35.153
hos for schools,
always for pleasure, break all the rules!

00:35.286 --> 00:37.072
Give me that ass. Slap it.

00:37.205 --> 00:38.820
Pat, pat, pat, pat.

00:38.956 --> 00:40.742
Right here. Stripper spank.

00:40.875 --> 00:43.708
Ooh, I almost forgot.
My newest campaign promise.

00:43.836 --> 00:49.251
If elected, I will introduce legislation
that will rename Lee Circle.

00:49.383 --> 00:52.420
From this day forth it will no longer be in honor

00:52.553 --> 00:55.260
of that sainted Robert E. Lee.

00:55.389 --> 00:57.345
Walking With Mister Lee Circle

00:57.475 --> 01:00.137
will honor Mr. Lee Allen,

01:00.269 --> 01:03.011
the greatest tenor saxman
this city has ever produced.

01:03.147 --> 01:05.263
So, buy my CD.

01:05.399 --> 01:07.651
— (Woman) That's right.
— For sale right here.

01:07.777 --> 01:09.984
Ooh, and for all my friends
in the gay community,

01:10.112 --> 01:12.899
and District C is the gay district,

01:13.032 --> 01:14.943
uh—huh,

01:15.076 --> 01:18.739
remember, all crimes against nature
will be naturalized in the Crescent City.

01:18.871 --> 01:23.615
I give you my sacred oath.
We will reform the Napoleonic code.

01:23.751 --> 01:25.412
J‘ Vote for me! J‘

02:59.847 --> 03:01.758
(Toni) Make Sofia some leftovers.

03:01.891 --> 03:04.257
There's a half a meatloaf on the top shelf.

03:04.393 --> 03:06.054
This gray thing in Saran Wrap?

03:06.187 --> 03:10.351
You can pop it in the microwave
or slice it cold for sandwiches.

03:10.483 --> 03:12.019
Do we have any more Creole mustard?

03:12.151 --> 03:15.643
— Who puts Creole mustard on meatloaf?
- I do.

03:15.780 --> 03:17.645
I put Creole mustard on everything.

03:17.782 --> 03:19.864
Where are you going again? Port Sulphur?

03:19.992 --> 03:21.903
- Port Arthur.
— That's in Texas.

03:22.036 --> 03:25.949
No, you swore a solemn oath. I didn't.
What's Sofia up to?

03:26.082 --> 03:27.913
Oh, she's working on her costume.

03:28.042 --> 03:29.953
Make sure she does her homework too.

03:30.086 --> 03:31.792
Promise?

03:31.921 --> 03:35.004
— (Horns honking)
— Cray, listen, l...| gotta drive here.

03:35.132 --> 03:36.963
I'll see you tomorrow. Love you.

03:37.093 --> 03:39.084
You too.

03:42.681 --> 03:44.842
(J‘ Music playing over speakers)

04:11.919 --> 04:14.126
(J‘ Playing Basin Street Blues)

04:14.255 --> 04:16.587
(Playing clumsily)

04:34.275 --> 04:37.563
J‘ Won't you come along with me

04:38.821 --> 04:40.812
(Man) Yeah, dance, white boy.

04:40.948 --> 04:43.781
J‘ To the Mississippi?

04:45.953 --> 04:50.868
J‘ We're going down to the land of dreams

04:51.000 --> 04:55.710
J‘ From down the river
down to New Orleans J‘

04:55.838 --> 04:57.920
— Yeah, you know why?
— (Man) Why?

04:58.048 --> 04:59.299
(Sonny) Because...

04:59.425 --> 05:04.215
J‘ Basin Street is a street

05:04.346 --> 05:07.713
J‘ Where all them white and black characters from them
First Precinct meet

05:07.850 --> 05:09.511
— J‘ In New Orleans J‘
— (Chattering)

05:09.643 --> 05:12.350
— J‘ The land of dreams J‘
— (Man) High as a kite.

05:12.480 --> 05:14.311
J‘ You never know how nice it seems

05:14.440 --> 05:17.898
J‘ Until you get down south to New Orleans

05:18.027 --> 05:22.896
J‘ I'm proud to be, yes sirree

05:23.032 --> 05:24.067
J‘ Rebel rebel free, baby

05:24.200 --> 05:26.031
J‘ New Orleans, take these with me, right? J‘

05:26.160 --> 05:28.617
(Man) Learn the words, motherfucker.

05:28.746 --> 05:30.737
(J‘ Playing Salee Dame)

05:33.209 --> 05:35.200
(J‘ Singing in French)

05:51.143 --> 05:54.010
(Man) Et toi? Give it up, Phoenix.

05:54.146 --> 05:56.558
(Second man) Oh, yeah!
(Third man) Yee—haw!

05:59.318 --> 06:01.309
Now that's traditional.

06:02.571 --> 06:04.948
The banjo ain't my bag,
but this dude can play.

06:05.074 --> 06:07.907
Don Vappie? Oh, yeah.

06:08.035 --> 06:10.117
I've always been down
with traditional myself.

06:10.246 --> 06:13.864
Yeah, I noticed, but you old school
and cutting edge at the same time.

06:13.999 --> 06:17.787
That's New Orleans, young man.
Many styles, many traditions.

06:17.920 --> 06:20.161
Yeah, but for me traditional is Bird and Diz

06:20.297 --> 06:24.711
playing Salt Peanuts at Massey Hall
with Bud Powell and Max Roach.

06:24.843 --> 06:27.425
— And Charles Mingus on bass.
— Right, exactly!

06:27.555 --> 06:29.841
One, two, three. Yeah!

06:31.183 --> 06:32.923
Come on, y'all. Keep goin', come on!

06:33.060 --> 06:35.927
I'll tell you what,
let's go up here and do our set,

06:36.063 --> 06:37.928
but end with a little something from home.

06:38.065 --> 06:39.726
Like what?

06:39.858 --> 06:43.225
lko, Mardi Gras Mambo,

06:43.362 --> 06:45.273
Saints.

06:45.406 --> 06:48.443
You gotta give the good people of Arizona
a little of what they came to hear.

06:48.576 --> 06:50.567
Just play our set, man.

07:09.597 --> 07:11.212
Mr. Dietrich?

07:11.348 --> 07:13.760
Jim Dietrich? l'm Toni Bernette.

07:13.892 --> 07:17.134
I'm a lawyer from New Orleans, and I need
to talk to you for a minute, if I may.

07:17.271 --> 07:19.603
It's not about NOPD.

07:19.732 --> 07:21.723
I'm looking for somebody who's missing,

07:21.859 --> 07:26.319
and I drove all this way
hoping you'd be able to help me.

07:29.575 --> 07:33.033
(Taxicab radio chatter)

07:35.789 --> 07:39.077
— Hey, Angie.
— Hey, Antoine.

07:39.209 --> 07:41.370
— How you doing?
— Good, baby. How are you?

07:41.503 --> 07:43.368
I'm good.

07:43.505 --> 07:46.042
- What you got there?
— It's a little something for your daddy.

07:46.175 --> 07:49.042
— Oh, yeah? He's inside.
- (Both) Mwah!

07:49.178 --> 07:51.965
(J‘ Music playing quietly)

07:52.097 --> 07:54.588
That's a real fine horn.

07:54.725 --> 07:56.681
To replace the one you lost in the flood.

07:56.810 --> 07:59.347
It's beautiful, Daddy.

07:59.480 --> 08:02.972
I can't. This must have cost a fortune.

08:03.108 --> 08:04.484
See, I didn't buy it.

08:04.610 --> 08:06.316
Somebody bought it for you.

08:06.445 --> 08:09.187
Yeah, a jazz fan. Japanese cat.

08:09.323 --> 08:12.030
Come through town, looking to do good
for New Orleans musicians, right?

08:12.159 --> 08:15.196
I told him about your situation
and he knew all about you.

08:15.329 --> 08:17.194
Yeah, big fan.

08:17.331 --> 08:20.243
He said it was the least he could do.

08:20.376 --> 08:22.708
- An honor.
— I don't know.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.997
I ain't felt much like blowing, you know?

08:25.130 --> 08:26.870
That's because you ain't had one to blow.

08:27.007 --> 08:30.545
Now look here, maestro,
that thing needs to make noise.

08:30.678 --> 08:32.714
I don't know what to say.

08:32.846 --> 08:34.382
Like you always told me.

08:34.515 --> 08:38.349
Straight ahead and strive for tone.

08:43.399 --> 08:46.141
Spoken to every officer
from the Second District

08:46.276 --> 08:48.767
who worked the midnight to eight shift
that Sunday.

08:48.904 --> 08:51.111
Well, everybody except for you

08:51.240 --> 08:53.401
and Bobby Foskett.

08:53.534 --> 08:56.401
- (Thunder rumbling)
— Why Second District?

08:56.537 --> 08:59.574
A young man I'm looking for
lived on Valence Street,

08:59.707 --> 09:02.744
and the restaurant he worked at
is at Laurel and Webster.

09:02.876 --> 09:04.537
OK.

09:04.670 --> 09:06.752
Well, his boss asked him
to do something at the restaurant

09:06.880 --> 09:09.132
that morning just before the storm blew in.

09:09.258 --> 09:10.748
He never showed.

09:10.884 --> 09:13.296
My best guess,
he was stopped on the way there.

09:13.429 --> 09:15.590
— (Thunder)
— That's thin.

09:15.723 --> 09:18.305
(Chuckles) That's what I've got.

09:18.434 --> 09:21.597
So you talked to everyone else
in the 12 to eight,

09:21.729 --> 09:24.812
and it's down to me and Bobby Foskett.

09:24.940 --> 09:28.933
— And Bobby Foskett's dead.
— You heard?

09:29.069 --> 09:32.732
Ate his gun a month after the storm.

09:36.076 --> 09:38.237
Still don't know how you found me.

09:38.370 --> 09:41.112
You had your last check sent
to your sister's here in Port Arthur.

09:41.248 --> 09:44.536
After that, it was easy.
I just called the utility company.

09:47.004 --> 09:49.620
Only had a couple of traffic stops
that morning.

09:49.757 --> 09:54.046
When the storm blew in,
we had our fuckin' hands full.

09:57.931 --> 10:01.344
I pulled over a black male
about this guy's age,

10:01.477 --> 10:03.968
blew through the light
at Nashville and Tchoupitoulas.

10:04.104 --> 10:05.935
Blew through it right in front of me,

10:06.064 --> 10:08.100
so I had to hit the blue tops,

10:08.233 --> 10:10.269
give him a ticket.

10:12.988 --> 10:14.649
This young man?

10:14.782 --> 10:17.194
Could be. I don't know.

10:17.326 --> 10:19.567
This matters.

10:19.703 --> 10:21.910
I need a positive ID for the habeas.

10:22.039 --> 10:24.121
I need you to be sure.

10:25.959 --> 10:28.291
That was five months ago.

10:28.420 --> 10:30.331
And let's be honest,

10:30.464 --> 10:33.627
he looks like a lot of guys
I've written up over the years.

10:35.469 --> 10:36.925
I'm sorry.

10:37.054 --> 10:39.340
lwish I could help.

10:39.473 --> 10:41.589
But that was another life.

10:41.725 --> 10:43.090
I'm done with NOPD.

10:43.227 --> 10:45.309
Done with New Orleans too,
for what it's worth.

10:48.190 --> 10:50.897
— That's me.
— (J‘ Band playing)

10:51.026 --> 10:52.562
You don't have to take that.

10:52.694 --> 10:54.605
— Cray, it's on wheels.
- No problem.

10:54.738 --> 10:58.196
We're just across the way,
short-term parking.

10:58.325 --> 11:00.907
You didn't need to pick me up.
I'd have taken a cab.

11:01.036 --> 11:02.947
Don't be silly.

11:03.080 --> 11:05.867
My agent comes
all the way from New York...

11:05.999 --> 11:08.376
I'm so glad to see you, Cray.

11:08.502 --> 11:12.211
You should come to New York more often.
How long has it been?

11:12.339 --> 11:14.375
Carla, level with me, will ya?

11:14.508 --> 11:16.464
They want their advance back, don't they?

11:16.593 --> 11:19.335
I know they haven't forgotten about it.

11:19.972 --> 11:23.715
I know it's just gnawing the guts
out of some bean counter.

11:23.851 --> 11:27.389
There are a couple of things
I wanna talk to you about,

11:27.521 --> 11:29.637
but it's all good.

11:29.773 --> 11:32.606
— Oh.
— I love the band.

11:32.734 --> 11:35.476
The best airport music ever.

11:38.532 --> 11:41.740
Why'd you quit? If you don't mind my asking.

11:41.869 --> 11:45.532
Ma'am, I worked eight straight days
after that storm,

11:45.664 --> 11:48.121
all of it out of my car.

11:48.250 --> 11:50.866
I wore the same uniform, stank like a dog.

11:51.003 --> 11:53.745
Ate, drank what I could scavenge.

11:53.881 --> 11:57.044
At some point I just had to wonder why.

11:58.802 --> 12:02.090
My house was underwater,
everything I owned with it.

12:02.222 --> 12:04.304
It ain't like I'm too old
to do something else, you know?

12:04.433 --> 12:05.673
Mm.

12:05.809 --> 12:08.016
ljust had enough.

12:10.522 --> 12:14.765
— What are you going to do now?
— My brother's in Corpus with the union,

12:14.902 --> 12:17.609
gonna get me some work offshore.

12:17.738 --> 12:20.855
— Good luck.
- You too.

12:23.994 --> 12:27.407
Sorry I can't put a face
to that Tchoupitoulas stop.

12:27.539 --> 12:30.827
| feel bad it was me
who got your friend lost in the sauce.

12:36.506 --> 12:39.418
The young man on Tchoupitoulas
who ran a red light.

12:39.551 --> 12:41.928
— You said you wrote him a ticket.
— I had to.

12:42.054 --> 12:44.045
He blew through the light
right in front of me.

12:44.181 --> 12:47.423
— But you didn't lock him up, right?
— Yeah, he got locked up.

12:48.393 --> 12:50.008
Wait, wait.

12:50.145 --> 12:52.431
You arrested him for running a red light?

12:52.564 --> 12:54.520
No, for the warrant.

12:56.234 --> 12:57.895
The warrant?

13:00.364 --> 13:02.776
Guess we're not done.

13:03.992 --> 13:06.779
(Creighton) Carla, I thought Random House
wrote me off a long time ago.

13:06.912 --> 13:08.777
Maybe they did, to a certain extent,

13:08.914 --> 13:12.577
but Katrina has put New Orleans
back on the map in a certain way.

13:12.709 --> 13:15.917
(Chuckles) lt nearly wiped it
off the map, actually.

13:16.713 --> 13:20.001
The near—death of an American city
and now my publisher's hot for a book

13:20.133 --> 13:22.249
they couldn't care less about
six months ago.

13:22.386 --> 13:26.299
Actually, they're not only interested in
bringing your novel out on next fall's list,

13:26.431 --> 13:29.389
but they want you to do something contemporary before
then.

13:29.518 --> 13:32.601
- Contemporary?
— Yeah, those passionate editorials

13:32.729 --> 13:35.106
that you've been doing on the internet?

13:35.232 --> 13:37.018
I showed a couple to your editor

13:37.150 --> 13:40.768
and, uh, Lisa loves that voice from you.

13:40.904 --> 13:43.611
Fuck You, You Fucking Fucks. Nice title.

13:43.740 --> 13:47.528
From serious novelist to cartoon
in one single volume.

13:47.661 --> 13:49.526
No, they'd bring the novel out after.

13:49.663 --> 13:52.200
And if you can manage
to make the novel contemporary,

13:52.332 --> 13:57.702
— maybe set part of it in post—Katrina...
— The novel is about the 1927 flood.

13:57.838 --> 14:00.454
It speaks to the present situation
only as metaphor.

14:00.590 --> 14:03.377
Well, perhaps if you could
bookend some older material...

14:03.510 --> 14:06.843
Jesus Christ, Carla.
I thought you said they wanted the book.

14:06.972 --> 14:09.634
They do, but in the voice
that you have become.

14:09.766 --> 14:11.927
You're a spokesman now for this city.

14:12.060 --> 14:16.474
I'm not trying to be the spokesman of the city. New Orleans
speaks for itself.

14:16.606 --> 14:19.894
And the novel is what it is.
If they still want it, fine.

14:20.027 --> 14:23.110
You haven't published in eight years, Cray.

14:23.238 --> 14:27.151
And now because of the storm,
yes, because of it,

14:27.284 --> 14:30.321
your publisher wants this book desperately.

14:30.454 --> 14:32.695
This is an opportunity.

14:35.042 --> 14:36.953
I'll finish the damn novel.

14:37.085 --> 14:40.543
When? What can I tell them?

14:40.672 --> 14:44.836
I need a month, six weeks maybe.

14:44.968 --> 14:47.584
But it's a novel about the '27 flood.

14:47.721 --> 14:50.633
That's what they bought.
That's what I'm writing.

14:50.766 --> 14:53.508
I checked for warrants on David
when | first began looking for him.

14:53.643 --> 14:55.850
There is nothing on record with any court.

14:55.979 --> 14:58.561
You think I want to lock the man up
with a hurricane coming?

14:58.690 --> 15:00.601
l was gonna let him roll with the traffic ticket,

15:00.734 --> 15:04.443
but how am I gonna cut a guy loose when he's got a
warrant on him for failing to appear?

15:07.282 --> 15:10.774
Radioed for the sergeant to meet me
back at lPC, sign off on the papenNork.

15:10.911 --> 15:13.618
I waited for...must've been an hour,
maybe more.

15:13.747 --> 15:18.116
Finally, I make phone contact with him.
Says he's out of pocket, shit's hitting the fan,

15:18.251 --> 15:20.333
he'd come down
at the end of the shift and sign off.

15:20.462 --> 15:23.204
So I left the guy there.
They said they'd hold him for the sergeant.

15:23.340 --> 15:25.672
And whatever paperwork
you left for the prisoner

15:25.801 --> 15:29.794
goes under ten feet of water
when the jail floods, huh?

15:31.932 --> 15:35.675
The affidavit from your citation book.
There'd be a carbon of it.

15:35.811 --> 15:38.803
— Left it in the car.
— At Second District?

15:38.939 --> 15:41.646
— Lake Charles.
— Lake Charles?

15:41.775 --> 15:43.640
When I left, ljust crawled in my unit

15:43.777 --> 15:46.735
— and drove out of town.
- Why Lake Charles?

15:46.863 --> 15:49.980
You think l was gonna take
an NOPD unit out of Louisiana?

15:50.117 --> 15:54.076
l was in enough trouble taking it out of town, never mind
across state line.

15:54.204 --> 15:57.913
I drove it onto the Lake Charles PD lot,
left the keys at the front desk,

15:58.041 --> 16:00.077
told them to call New Orleans, let 'em know.

16:00.210 --> 16:03.043
Then I got my brother—in—law
to drive over and get me.

16:03.171 --> 16:05.753
Take another look, please?

16:10.720 --> 16:14.258
Sorry. I can't be sure it's him.

16:14.391 --> 16:17.758
I mean, if you want me to be honest about it.

16:26.194 --> 16:28.150
(J‘ Music playing)

16:29.281 --> 16:30.521
You gave him a drink?

16:30.657 --> 16:33.114
(Jacques) All he wanted was a Barq's.

16:33.243 --> 16:35.700
It goes with everything.

16:35.829 --> 16:37.820
Jacques, what am I gonna tell him?

16:37.956 --> 16:39.867
I can't run a restaurant without meat.

16:40.000 --> 16:43.208
I don't even know
how I'm gonna pay staff today.

16:43.336 --> 16:45.588
You can't make payroll?

16:45.714 --> 16:47.250
(Pounding at door)

16:47.382 --> 16:50.465
— Oh, shit. Who's that?
— Seafood.

16:52.095 --> 16:54.461
- (Pounding continues)
— Fuck me.

16:56.016 --> 16:58.507
Give him a Barq's too.

17:04.691 --> 17:06.056
What's up, Jacques?

17:06.193 --> 17:09.731
Uh, Janette had to run out
for a few minutes.

17:09.863 --> 17:13.401
It's funny how everybody all of a sudden
got all these errands they gotta run today.

17:13.533 --> 17:16.491
She has a very busy afternoon.
But if you'd like to wait...

17:16.620 --> 17:19.202
I don't want to, but I will.

17:21.875 --> 17:23.786
(Jacques) What would you like to drink?

17:23.919 --> 17:26.035
Scotch.

17:26.171 --> 17:29.038
- (Door opens)
— (Ben) You too, huh?

17:30.926 --> 17:33.258
Hey, Daddy.

17:33.386 --> 17:36.093
Heard them talking about
your YouTube stuff on the radio.

17:36.223 --> 17:37.759
You're famous.

17:37.891 --> 17:41.725
l'm mentioned. There's a difference.
Was that your mom on the phone?

17:41.853 --> 17:44.230
She said she'd be home
tomorrow morning for sure.

17:44.356 --> 17:46.187
Are we out of milk again?

17:46.316 --> 17:47.806
Right.

17:48.902 --> 17:50.733
"Davis can save us." What is that?

17:50.862 --> 17:52.272
Oh, it's the Davis bumper sticker.

17:52.405 --> 17:54.441
He's running for city council.

17:54.574 --> 17:56.235
Davis McAlary?

17:56.368 --> 17:59.075
Our Davis who's teaching you boogie—woogie?

17:59.204 --> 18:01.445
That bozo's running for council?

18:01.581 --> 18:03.537
J‘ Vote for me, I ain't fakin'

18:05.585 --> 18:07.792
— Hey.
— Mom's not here.

18:07.921 --> 18:10.333
It's not your language. This isn't funny.

18:10.465 --> 18:12.626
What's happening
in New Orleans now is not a joke.

18:12.759 --> 18:15.000
We're fighting for our lives,
for our way of life.

18:15.136 --> 18:17.127
People are dying. People are homeless.

18:17.264 --> 18:20.472
People are stuck all over the place.
They can't get back.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.761
Everything is not a joke all the time.

18:22.894 --> 18:26.512
— You mean like Krewe du Vieux?
— That's political satire.

18:26.648 --> 18:29.890
It's a long tradition. This is just wrong.

18:35.907 --> 18:37.898
(Man) Where's the gaffer?

18:41.663 --> 18:43.528
— Can I help you?
- Yeah.

18:43.665 --> 18:46.828
Davis McAlary,
here for the candidates' forum.

18:48.712 --> 18:50.703
Mm.

18:51.631 --> 18:55.123
McAlary, you are indeed
a registered candidate.

18:55.260 --> 18:57.501
Paid the fees with cash money.

19:01.016 --> 19:03.007
Come with me.

19:05.270 --> 19:08.262
Hold that. Enjoy that.

19:09.316 --> 19:11.181
(J‘ Music playing)

19:11.318 --> 19:13.400
— (Sonny) It's pretty good.
- Yeah.

19:13.528 --> 19:15.985
Getting me a shitload of those, you know?

19:16.114 --> 19:17.979
That sounds good.

19:21.328 --> 19:23.740
(Coughing)

19:33.048 --> 19:36.085
— He's in Chicago now? Palmer House?
— (Phil Frazier) Yeah.

19:36.217 --> 19:39.345
— And Troy's playing trumpet?
- Like I told you, man.

19:39.471 --> 19:41.678
— You're sure?
— Yeah, I got you.

19:41.806 --> 19:43.762
— All right, I'll call him right now.
- Sure.

19:43.892 --> 19:45.883
Thanks.

19:49.356 --> 19:52.018
— Honey, it's your turn to...
- Sh, sh. Hold on now.

19:52.150 --> 19:54.687
— (Woman) The Palmer House.
— Can I speak to one of your guests?

19:54.819 --> 19:57.526
— Sure. What's the name?
- Yeah, uh, Dr. John.

19:57.655 --> 20:00.943
- Dr. John?
— The musician Dr. John.

20:01.076 --> 20:03.738
— Is there another name he goes by?
— I don't know.

20:03.870 --> 20:06.111
That is his name.
Oh, I know what you're saying.

20:06.247 --> 20:08.829
lt's, um, Mac...

20:08.958 --> 20:12.200
Uh, Mac...

20:12.337 --> 20:13.827
- Aw, shit.
— Sorry, sir.

20:13.963 --> 20:15.578
— No, pardon me.
— No Mac.

20:15.715 --> 20:18.127
— You ain't got a Mac?
— Not registered.

20:18.259 --> 20:20.250
(Softly) Hey, you remember
his real last name?

20:20.387 --> 20:22.719
— Rebennack.
— Rebennack.

20:22.847 --> 20:25.429
— How do you spell that?
- Like it sounds, shit.

20:25.558 --> 20:26.934
— One moment.
- (Silence)

20:27.060 --> 20:29.597
— (Whispers) You're welcome.
—(Beeps)

20:29.729 --> 20:33.267
— (Dr. John) Yeah?
— Yeah, uh, Dr. John,

20:33.400 --> 20:35.812
it's Antoine Batiste
calling from New Orleans.

20:35.944 --> 20:37.480
Hey, Antoine. What's happening?

20:37.612 --> 20:40.900
Uh, yeah, Philip Frazier
told me | oughta call you.

20:41.032 --> 20:43.444
You might need a trombone
to fill in on a tour you're making?

20:43.576 --> 20:45.908
Look, Antoine, I'd love to have you
with the Aggravation,

20:46.037 --> 20:49.450
— but we already got Troy playing slide.
— I thought Troy was playing trumpet.

20:49.582 --> 20:52.824
— Charlie Miller is playing that...
- That motherfucker.

20:52.961 --> 20:57.045
..this time around.
| wish I could hook you up.

20:57.173 --> 20:59.789
Uh, yeah.

20:59.926 --> 21:03.168
Well, that's all right. Thanks.

21:03.304 --> 21:06.512
— Hey, keep me in mind, you know? I could...
- Yeah, you bet.

21:06.641 --> 21:08.427
(Phone clicks)

21:13.898 --> 21:15.980
(Grunts)

21:16.109 --> 21:18.725
Don't worry yet. You'll find something.

21:20.905 --> 21:24.989
(Woman) And, Peggy, that is why I'm the
best candidate for city council, District C.

21:25.118 --> 21:29.031
— Mr. McCleary.
- McAlary.

21:29.164 --> 21:31.997
My apologies. Mr. McAlary.

21:33.084 --> 21:34.824
Oh, um...

21:34.961 --> 21:38.453
Well, first I'd like to sing
some of my campaign song.

21:40.467 --> 21:42.833
— So just...
— l have to ask you to stay within the format.

21:42.969 --> 21:44.709
— No singing.
— (Man laughs)

21:44.846 --> 21:47.553
You have two minutes
for an opening statement.

21:47.682 --> 21:49.593
OK.

21:51.686 --> 21:53.677
(J‘ Playing Yardbird Delight)

22:38.274 --> 22:40.139
(Song ends)

22:40.276 --> 22:42.107
(Applause, cheering)

22:42.237 --> 22:44.569
Thank you, Houston!

22:44.697 --> 22:48.986
Oh, man. Loved that, man. Loved that.

22:49.118 --> 22:50.949
Donald's homage to Bird, man.

22:51.079 --> 22:53.195
- Yeah, you know it?
— You better believe it, baby.

22:53.331 --> 22:55.538
- All right.
— Beautiful!

22:55.667 --> 22:58.500
Thanks, Don. You guys did a great set too.

23:00.046 --> 23:02.002
— Looks like an encore.
— Hey.

23:02.131 --> 23:05.259
— lko.
— You ain't gonna quit?

23:05.385 --> 23:07.421
— You know you like it.
- Aw.

23:07.554 --> 23:10.967
— (J‘ Playing lko lko)
— (Crowd cheering)

23:13.643 --> 23:15.508
(Man) One more time, y'all.

23:15.645 --> 23:17.852
(Woman) Come on, let's hear it again.

23:37.125 --> 23:39.332
(Crowd) J‘ Hey now! Hey now!

23:40.503 --> 23:42.619
(Crowd) J‘ Oh—oh—oh

24:02.775 --> 24:05.517
(Jacques) You want me to lock up?

24:05.653 --> 24:07.814
I don't know.

24:08.990 --> 24:13.324
So it's official now. I'm now on COD
with every one of our suppliers.

24:13.453 --> 24:15.990
COD plus five with Harvey.

24:16.122 --> 24:19.660
COD plus ten with Cusimano.

24:19.792 --> 24:22.625
I can't write rubber checks
and I can't cook without food.

24:23.463 --> 24:24.919
The bank?

24:25.048 --> 24:27.164
I owe them a huge balloon payment.

24:27.300 --> 24:30.042
And I can't go to my parents again.

24:30.178 --> 24:35.263
And the thing is, we're still putting out
a menu every night that I'm proud of.

24:36.684 --> 24:40.552
I mean, we're short, we're tight,
but push comes to shove...

24:40.688 --> 24:44.647
— You killed those chefs.
— l buried 'em, didn't I?

24:44.776 --> 24:46.266
Oui.

24:47.320 --> 24:49.311
(Sighs)

24:54.911 --> 24:57.618
You think the staff can hang in for a week?

24:59.165 --> 25:01.281
Till I can figure out how to deal with this?

25:02.669 --> 25:04.625
Come up with it somewhere?

25:04.754 --> 25:06.745
Without pay?

25:13.304 --> 25:15.260
You can ask.

25:17.517 --> 25:21.055
(Davis) One of my cornerstone programs
is called Greased Palm Sunday.

25:21.187 --> 25:23.769
If we're gonna have corruption,
let's just be honest about it.

25:23.898 --> 25:26.310
So, one Sunday a month,

25:26.442 --> 25:29.559
we will have an official televised session

25:29.696 --> 25:32.813
in which the money be delivered
and the deals made.

25:32.949 --> 25:35.941
— "Real bribes in real time" will be my motto.
- You're right, bro.

25:36.077 --> 25:38.409
Let's have some straight—up,
honest double—dealing.

25:38.538 --> 25:41.826
Sunlight. It's the best disinfectant.

25:41.958 --> 25:44.165
- Well, I'm on.
— (Peggy) Interesting.

25:44.293 --> 25:46.079
McAlary, you're whack.

25:46.212 --> 25:48.248
"Sunlight is the best disinfectant"?

25:48.381 --> 25:50.292
— Yeah, I read that somewhere.
- (Chuckles)

25:50.425 --> 25:52.586
- What, it's not true?
— (Coco) Kill the TV, Janice.

25:52.719 --> 25:54.584
Well, it sounds true.

25:54.721 --> 25:57.258
- (Mutes TV)
— (J‘ Music starts)

25:57.390 --> 26:00.553
J‘ When the time is right on a night in June

26:00.685 --> 26:04.098
J‘ All the hoodoo dance
underneath the moon

26:04.230 --> 26:07.438
J‘ What goes on, child, you better believe

26:07.567 --> 26:11.480
J‘ Way down in New Orlean
on St. John's Eve J‘

26:11.612 --> 26:13.694
(Antoine) Three damn hours on the phone.

26:13.823 --> 26:17.816
I'm ready to play the goddamn zoo
for elephants.

26:17.952 --> 26:19.658
(Kermit) I might have something for you.

26:19.787 --> 26:23.450
- You can read, right?
— I can read flyshit on staff paper.

26:23.583 --> 26:27.667
(Chuckles) You're gonna need a tux.
Carnival time, bro.

26:27.795 --> 26:30.582
— Balls and all.
— The Mardi Gras ball?

26:30.715 --> 26:33.252
— Yeah, like the Bunch Club.
— Really?

26:33.384 --> 26:34.965
Well, LaDonna bought me a tux,

26:35.094 --> 26:37.961
you know, for that tribute
for Duke Dejan and Olympia.

26:38.097 --> 26:42.306
— Yeah. Still got it?
— Must be in a box somewhere.

26:42.435 --> 26:44.642
Who else is on this gig
besides me and you?

26:44.771 --> 26:46.853
Nah, man, I ain't on. But you'll be cool.

26:46.981 --> 26:49.313
Ah. (Chuckles)

26:49.442 --> 26:52.980
I played the MOMs ball once,
sitting in with the Radiators.

26:53.112 --> 26:57.321
It was wild, man, I'm telling you.
The band was playing, you know.

26:57.450 --> 27:01.443
Everybody was screwing every which way.

27:01.579 --> 27:05.288
I guess I could use a little fun myself.
You know what I'm saying?

27:05.416 --> 27:08.453
— Happy Mardi Gras, Batiste.
- Happy Mardi Gras.

27:12.381 --> 27:15.418
(Davis) There's no fuckin' reason
why we gotta have potholes

27:15.551 --> 27:17.212
that can swallow your whole fucking car.

27:17.345 --> 27:20.178
- You feel me?
— He's obsessive about potholes.

27:20.306 --> 27:22.342
Somebody's gotta
call these motherfuckers out.

27:22.475 --> 27:24.966
I agree. You're right.

27:25.102 --> 27:27.639
You agree? Really?

27:27.772 --> 27:31.685
Jacques Morial, scion of a great
political dynasty, agrees with me.

27:31.818 --> 27:34.685
Man, that shit is funny.
Greased Palm Sunday.

27:34.821 --> 27:37.153
Pot for potholes. Don't forget that one.

27:37.281 --> 27:39.021
That's satire. That's good.

27:39.158 --> 27:41.319
But you have a chance
to raise some serious questions

27:41.452 --> 27:43.943
that none of these
other motherfuckers are gonna touch.

27:44.080 --> 27:44.990
I do?

27:45.122 --> 27:47.864
Look, looking ahead here,
we got some serious challenges.

27:48.000 --> 27:51.208
We got public housing,
we got expropriation of people's homes,

27:51.337 --> 27:53.498
we got when they're
gonna reopen Charity Hospital,

27:53.631 --> 27:57.044
and we got this big, nasty question
about who can come home and who can't.

27:57.176 --> 28:02.045
Right. Here's an idea.
Why don't you be my campaign manager?

28:02.181 --> 28:05.048
— Not gonna happen.
- (Laughter)

28:05.184 --> 28:09.769
But, look, what I can do is I can hook you up with some real
effective public exposure

28:09.897 --> 28:12.388
so we can get these issues on the table.

28:12.525 --> 28:14.857
That's if you really wanna kick it up a notch.

28:14.986 --> 28:17.728
— Hell, yeah.
— You should go for it, Davis.

28:21.409 --> 28:23.400
Do you really think I can win this?

28:23.536 --> 28:25.401
The election?

28:25.538 --> 28:26.994
No fuckin' way.

28:28.207 --> 28:29.538
Right.

28:29.667 --> 28:31.658
l was just checking.

28:32.962 --> 28:34.077
It's about time they sent someone.

28:34.213 --> 28:37.876
We've been calling NOPD about that vehicle for three
months now, maybe longer.

28:38.009 --> 28:41.342
The department's still in disarray,
to say the least.

28:41.470 --> 28:43.802
I mean, how does a cop leave his post

28:43.931 --> 28:46.092
and abandon his vehicle
and just walk away?

28:46.225 --> 28:48.716
If it was up to me,
they'd throw his ass in jail.

28:50.229 --> 28:52.606
You had to be there, I guess.

28:52.732 --> 28:55.394
After Katrina we got hit with Rita
and we didn't loot,

28:55.526 --> 28:58.768
complain, go crazy or run away like y'all did.

29:00.031 --> 29:03.523
lt's open. Keys are inside. Have a nice trip.

30:06.973 --> 30:08.804
What, you're not taking the car?

30:08.933 --> 30:12.175
— Not myjob, I'm afraid.
— No? What the hell is it you do?

30:12.311 --> 30:15.178
Well, I'm from, uh, document retrieval.

30:15.314 --> 30:19.899
Vehicle retrieval will be here
and get that car, no problem.

30:20.027 --> 30:22.404
Your whole damn town's crazy,
you know that?

30:22.530 --> 30:25.863
You're preaching to the choir, officer. Preaching to the
choir!

30:25.992 --> 30:28.153
(Franklin) Got back in my house,

30:28.285 --> 30:31.027
this was the only thing left.

30:31.163 --> 30:33.154
This floated.

30:35.334 --> 30:37.290
I took it as a sign, Chief.

30:37.420 --> 30:40.002
We gotta mask this year.

30:40.131 --> 30:42.918
I started that one right before the storm.

30:43.050 --> 30:45.211
Still don't got nowhere
to hook up my suit though.

30:45.344 --> 30:47.255
My daughter asked me
to come back to Atlanta.

30:47.388 --> 30:50.300
But what am I gonna do in Atlanta, Albert?

30:50.433 --> 30:53.470
You can park your van right here.

30:53.602 --> 30:55.513
We can do an extra practice this week.

30:55.646 --> 31:00.231
— Who else back?
- George, Troy.

31:00.359 --> 31:03.772
— Ronnie coming from Memphis.
— He don't have nowhere to stay either.

31:03.904 --> 31:06.987
— Calliope closed.
— Yeah, I know.

31:07.116 --> 31:11.735
l was over there.
Well, he can stay with me too.

31:11.871 --> 31:13.953
So we're masking for Mardi Gras, right?

31:15.207 --> 31:17.368
You're damn right.

31:18.544 --> 31:20.626
— Did we have a job that night?
— That's not the point.

31:20.755 --> 31:23.542
— Oh, yeah? What is the point?
— I'm saying that if you're playing

31:23.674 --> 31:25.665
with every fucking band
on Frenchmen Street,

31:25.801 --> 31:28.417
it dilutes what we are doing.

31:28.554 --> 31:32.388
It's just a gig at the Spotted Cat.
I want to play, Sonny.

31:32.516 --> 31:35.633
— You're not hearing a fuckin' word I'm saying.
— I hear you.

31:35.770 --> 31:38.261
You're saying I can't play any gigs
except your gigs.

31:38.397 --> 31:41.730
— No, I'm not saying that.
— I'm supposed to watch you get high all day

31:41.859 --> 31:43.770
and then say no when people
want me on real gigs

31:43.903 --> 31:46.519
because you're worried it might ruin
what we're doing on the street?

31:46.655 --> 31:49.067
Passing around a fucking hat
for spare change?

31:56.832 --> 31:58.413
Ann.

31:59.460 --> 32:02.543
(Door opens, slams)

32:03.255 --> 32:05.246
(J‘ Band playing Quantum Time)

32:32.368 --> 32:35.451
— (Donald) So good to be back in New Orleans. —
(Applause)

32:37.790 --> 32:40.827
Yo, D, let's finish with
a little something from home.

32:40.960 --> 32:42.666
Nah, too easy.

32:42.795 --> 32:46.333
— I'm feeling like Coltrane, Giant Steps.
- OK.

32:49.969 --> 32:51.334
You go back to Paris.

32:51.470 --> 32:53.506
— You couldn't even get me a hotel room...
— (Larry sighs)

32:53.639 --> 32:56.096
I need something to blow up real soon.

32:57.143 --> 32:59.976
— Or a car chase.
- Sh, sh!

33:00.104 --> 33:01.685
(Phone ringing)

33:08.404 --> 33:10.816
- Hello?
— (Dominique) LaDonna?

33:10.948 --> 33:13.985
— Dominique? What's wrong?
— Your mama not doing well.

33:14.118 --> 33:15.824
l...| dropped by to look in on her.

33:15.953 --> 33:19.241
— What do you mean, not doing well?
- She's having trouble breathing.

33:19.373 --> 33:22.831
— Did you call the ambulance?
— I thought to call you first.

33:22.960 --> 33:26.703
— Call the 911 now. Can she talk?
— Yes.

33:26.839 --> 33:29.125
She asked me for some water
and I gave it to her.

33:29.258 --> 33:31.874
Call the goddamn ambulance.
Have them take her to Touro.

33:32.011 --> 33:34.753
— I'll be there as soon as I can, OK?
- All right.

33:34.889 --> 33:38.598
Dominique, call them now,
as soon as I hang up the phone, OK?

33:38.726 --> 33:40.387
|wi||.

33:41.437 --> 33:42.847
lt's Mama.

33:42.980 --> 33:46.768
We gotta seriously talk about
moving her up here, LaDonna.

33:46.901 --> 33:48.892
I'll call you when | get to the hospital.

33:49.028 --> 33:51.064
Drive safe.

33:55.951 --> 33:58.067
This was a great night.

33:58.204 --> 34:02.197
I really felt like
we were all working as a team.

34:02.333 --> 34:04.039
We've all been through a lot

34:04.168 --> 34:07.501
and I know how hard everyone in this room
has been working.

34:09.173 --> 34:13.758
I'm gonna have to ask something now
that I never thought I'd have to ask.

34:13.886 --> 34:16.753
I know how hard it is right now.

34:16.889 --> 34:20.677
I need to ask if you all
would be willing to go a week...

34:28.234 --> 34:30.350
I can't do it, Jacques.

34:31.612 --> 34:35.855
I mean, even if I did, even if everyone agreed, it wouldn't
solve the problem, right?

34:35.991 --> 34:39.404
I'd just be putting it off,
kicking it down the road.

34:40.913 --> 34:42.619
I can't make expenses

34:42.748 --> 34:45.956
and we're gonna have to suspend operations.

34:47.086 --> 34:49.293
Maybe for a couple of weeks, maybe...

34:49.421 --> 34:51.412
maybe for good.

34:53.133 --> 34:55.340
I'm not gonna ask you to work without pay.

34:55.469 --> 34:57.460
I can't.

34:58.847 --> 35:00.974
I know y'all will find jobs again right away.

35:01.767 --> 35:03.678
Everyone needs help.

35:05.271 --> 35:07.683
l'll hope that when we get
back up and running again

35:07.815 --> 35:10.306
you'll be able to come back.

35:15.114 --> 35:17.446
I think I'm gonna be sick. Excuse me.

35:24.456 --> 35:26.447
(Laughter)

35:27.251 --> 35:30.243
- The first set was on fire.
— Hey, doing the best we can.

35:30.379 --> 35:32.370
(Delmond) You know my daddy, right?

35:32.506 --> 35:34.167
Big Chief Albert.

35:34.300 --> 35:36.507
Big Chief Donald, yeah.

35:36.635 --> 35:41.049
Man, I had such a great time
playing with your son, baby boy.

35:41.181 --> 35:43.718
Yeah, y'all sound good together, real good.

35:43.851 --> 35:46.843
— Oh, you was listening?
- I heard every note.

35:46.979 --> 35:49.345
Chief, you coming out this year?

35:49.481 --> 35:53.690
— Well, whoever makes it, we'll be out there.
- Mm, I'm in the same boat as you.

35:53.819 --> 35:56.310
I know you're making that walk
with your dad this year.

35:56.447 --> 35:58.483
I leave first thing Monday.

35:58.615 --> 36:02.028
(Donald) All right. I guess I'll have
to holler at you back in New York.

36:02.161 --> 36:05.028
All right, cool, cool. Uh, you ready?

36:05.164 --> 36:07.155
Yeah, let's do it, man. Chief.

36:07.291 --> 36:10.158
— And you, baby.
— I'm looking for you.

36:10.294 --> 36:11.704
(Albert laughs)

36:11.837 --> 36:15.000
Practice is at eight o'clock tomorrow night.

36:15.132 --> 36:17.293
You ain't gonna stay for the next set?

36:17.426 --> 36:20.418
Ah, I got work to do. I'll see you then.

36:21.889 --> 36:24.505
Hey, D. Good to see you back.

36:27.644 --> 36:30.807
— I felt like I couldn't stand up.
— She knows that.

36:30.939 --> 36:34.227
We're trying to find out
what other medicines you...

36:34.360 --> 36:37.397
She was on the Diabinese for diabetes.

36:37.529 --> 36:40.145
— Diabinese. Was she taking that daily?
— Yes.

36:40.282 --> 36:42.568
— Where's Dominique?
— I sent her home. It's late.

36:42.701 --> 36:44.237
How late is it?

36:44.370 --> 36:46.326
A quarter to three.

36:46.455 --> 36:49.117
We can go as soon
as we finish here, Mama.

36:49.249 --> 36:51.865
They said you might have just had
a little low blood sugar.

36:52.002 --> 36:53.867
— You're all right.
- We can go?

36:54.004 --> 36:55.835
— Just a while.
— Does your pharmacy

36:55.964 --> 36:57.795
have any record of your mother's medications?

36:57.925 --> 36:59.916
They're closed.

37:00.052 --> 37:02.885
I don't know if they're coming back.

37:22.991 --> 37:25.027
Hi. May I take your order, please?

37:25.160 --> 37:26.741
Cafe au lait and beignets, please.

37:26.870 --> 37:29.486
Cafe au lait and beignets? Thank you.

37:54.148 --> 37:56.139
Thank you.

38:11.623 --> 38:13.534
(Creighton) Well, that's good news, right?

38:13.667 --> 38:16.830
I don't see how they can deny the writ now. They'll have to
find him.

38:16.962 --> 38:21.001
The bureaucracy loves
paper evidence, forms.

38:21.133 --> 38:23.465
They get really wet if it's a triplicate.

38:24.678 --> 38:27.465
— LaDonna must be thrilled.
— I haven't spoken to her yet.

38:27.598 --> 38:31.967
I left a message, but I think maybe
she went to Baton Rouge for the weekend.

38:32.686 --> 38:34.927
Pretty great, huh?

38:35.898 --> 38:38.480
Wow! That's quite the getup.

38:38.609 --> 38:41.021
— She finished that costume yesterday.
- Aw.

38:41.153 --> 38:44.520
- Guess what I am.
— Um, a space alien.

38:44.656 --> 38:46.487
- No.
— Oh, a pearl.

38:46.617 --> 38:48.699
You're part of a pearl necklace.

38:48.827 --> 38:52.160
— Nope. I have a tail, see?
— Um, do you know?

38:52.289 --> 38:54.496
Dad thought of it.
He planned the whole float.

38:55.584 --> 38:57.199
Guess again.

38:57.336 --> 38:59.201
(Toni) That's all I got, sweetie. I'm sorry.

38:59.338 --> 39:01.704
I'm a sperm. See?

39:01.840 --> 39:04.798
When we walk our tails
move back and forth like sperm.

39:04.927 --> 39:06.883
The centerpiece
of the Krewe du Vieux parade

39:07.012 --> 39:09.924
is a giant papier—mache replica
of our illustrious mayor

39:10.057 --> 39:12.890
in a semi—recumbent position
pleasuring himself.

39:13.018 --> 39:15.760
It's great. And we all walk in front,
waving our tails.

39:15.896 --> 39:18.012
- You're joking.
— lt's political commentary.

39:18.148 --> 39:19.729
The Mystic Krewe of Spermies.

39:19.858 --> 39:22.850
- The sperm lead the way.
— Yeah, as sperm so often do.

39:22.986 --> 39:26.274
And at what point did you decide to abdicate as the parent
of a 15-year-old girl?

39:26.406 --> 39:28.738
She knows everything anyway.
You know everything, right, Sof?

39:28.867 --> 39:31.950
— Uh—huh, of course.
— Creighton, this is over the top.

39:32.079 --> 39:35.321
Considering the circumstances,
I think we're showing admirable restraint.

39:35.457 --> 39:39.917
— But this is just...offensive.
— The mayor's performance is offensive.

39:40.045 --> 39:42.627
The indifference of the state
and federal government is offensive.

39:42.756 --> 39:46.089
— Fuck 'em if they can't take a joke.
— You parade as sperm on Saturday night

39:46.218 --> 39:48.584
and come Monday morning
l have to go into the city attorney

39:48.720 --> 39:51.427
and talk about what's going on
at the jail or with the police,

39:51.557 --> 39:55.141
and all they want to talk about is how
you used the mayor as a Mardi Gras gag.

39:55.269 --> 39:58.352
Don't take the fun out of everything.
We're making you one too.

39:58.480 --> 40:00.436
We'll be the family of sperm.

40:02.067 --> 40:04.854
Y'all do what you want.
You can count me out.

40:04.987 --> 40:06.773
Suit yourself.

40:09.992 --> 40:11.823
(Door bangs)

40:12.661 --> 40:14.197
Annie?

40:21.753 --> 40:24.916
Listen, all I wanna know is are you all right?

40:25.841 --> 40:29.333
I don't even know what that means anymore.

40:31.388 --> 40:33.925
I'm so sorry for yesterday.

40:36.768 --> 40:38.759
That wasn't me.

40:40.647 --> 40:42.638
lwas high.

40:44.276 --> 40:47.439
That's no excuse. I'm sorry.

40:48.947 --> 40:51.780
lt'll never happen again, promise.

40:53.243 --> 40:55.279
(J‘ Trombone playing)

41:10.302 --> 41:13.009
Whoo! Sound good, maestro.

41:13.138 --> 41:15.504
Embouchure is shot.

41:15.641 --> 41:18.178
Got no wind at all.

41:18.310 --> 41:21.052
Well, you know, keep shedding.
You'll be fine.

41:21.188 --> 41:24.555
— I can't play no gig, Antoine.
— Sure, you can.

41:24.691 --> 41:27.148
It ain't till next week, week after.

41:27.277 --> 41:29.734
— Where'd you say it was?
- The airport.

41:29.863 --> 41:32.149
It's one of them musicians' clinic gigs.

41:32.282 --> 41:36.275
I'm putting together a good group,
greeting folks as they're coming into town.

41:37.704 --> 41:40.821
Hey, it's a bill a man.

41:41.583 --> 41:44.040
All right, you talked me into it.

41:44.169 --> 41:49.380
Ah. The thing is, to get the gig,
we gotta go in for a checkup.

41:50.092 --> 41:52.048
Both of us this afternoon.

41:52.177 --> 41:56.591
I figure as long as l was here,
we might as well run over.

41:57.516 --> 42:02.260
- All right, but you let me pay the cab.
— How about we split it, huh? (Chuckles)

42:02.396 --> 42:07.891
I think renaming the Circle after
a local musician is a marvelous idea.

42:08.026 --> 42:10.358
Please, Mimi, don't be appalling.

42:11.154 --> 42:14.066
All we need is for someone
to point out the hypocrisy.

42:14.199 --> 42:15.985
Well, Davis, you yourself are named

42:16.118 --> 42:19.576
for the confederate president to whom
we are directly, if distantly, related.

42:19.705 --> 42:23.823
| tell people it's for Miles,
Sammy, Ossie or Angela.

42:23.959 --> 42:26.575
— Hah!
— (Man) I loved Sammy Davis.

42:26.712 --> 42:28.418
— Candy Man.
— What?

42:28.547 --> 42:30.128
But the question is, my darling boy,

42:30.257 --> 42:33.090
do you want people to take you
as a serious individual or not?

42:33.218 --> 42:35.083
Why would I do something
that would violate

42:35.220 --> 42:37.962
the entire logic of my life
as l have conducted it so far?

42:38.098 --> 42:39.929
You stick to your guns, Davis.

42:40.058 --> 42:42.595
— Thank you, Aunt Mimi.
— Thank you, Aunt Mimi.

42:42.728 --> 42:45.060
But I also feel compelled
to take exception to the idea

42:45.188 --> 42:48.271
that there's nothing serious
about what I can do with this.

42:48.400 --> 42:51.267
Jacques Morial says that l have
a chance to talk about issues

42:51.403 --> 42:52.939
that nobody else is talking about.

42:53.071 --> 42:55.528
A Morial? What's next?

42:55.657 --> 42:57.613
- Get over it, Ramona.
— (Ramona) The point is,

42:57.743 --> 43:00.359
we finally have a chance
to turn New Orleans around,

43:00.495 --> 43:01.996
now that certain elements are gone.

43:02.122 --> 43:05.956
But raising money from selling marijuana
is not the way to do it.

43:06.084 --> 43:09.997
Your carefully euphemized racist sentiments are duly
noted, my darling mother,

43:10.130 --> 43:14.373
but even you might agree that the city
needs every stream of revenue it can get.

43:14.509 --> 43:17.125
The city is broke and the city is broken.

43:17.262 --> 43:20.254
And it can't stay broke and get fixed.
It's a contradiction in terms.

43:20.390 --> 43:24.383
| always thought they oughta have
blackjack tables on the streetcars.

43:24.519 --> 43:27.886
Wait. "Blackjack on the track."

43:28.023 --> 43:30.059
Excellent idea.

43:30.192 --> 43:32.228
Ooh, I think it's time for another martini.

43:32.360 --> 43:34.612
How about a short one this time, Mimi?

43:34.738 --> 43:37.275
Oh, don't be vulgar, Roger.

43:38.450 --> 43:40.441
(Door closes)

43:58.303 --> 43:59.964
(Sighs)

44:06.478 --> 44:09.436
(Antoine) Bro, I'll keep your mom out.
What time you want me to bring her back?

44:09.564 --> 44:12.601
I'll need to write you a prescription
for your blood pressure.

44:12.734 --> 44:14.190
Yes, ma'am.

44:14.319 --> 44:18.232
And | just need to speak with your friend.
He's out of shape too.

44:19.241 --> 44:20.572
Antoine.

44:21.451 --> 44:24.693
— Hey, Miss Cathy.
— You need to drop 20 pounds.

44:24.830 --> 44:27.196
— Woman, you always say that.
- And it's always true.

44:27.332 --> 44:29.368
It would lower your blood pressure though.

44:29.501 --> 44:32.914
More gigs | get, lower my pressure.

44:33.046 --> 44:34.832
How's he doing?

44:34.965 --> 44:38.128
Well, I'll know exactly
when his blood work comes back,

44:38.260 --> 44:41.172
but he's not well and I think he's depressed.

44:43.515 --> 44:45.881
Ain't we all?

44:46.017 --> 44:48.008
(J‘ Music playing over speakers)

44:48.144 --> 44:50.009
Darius is coming to practice tonight.

44:50.146 --> 44:52.888
Well, the Indian thing is not for everybody.

44:53.024 --> 44:56.562
But if it's for you, it can make you strong.

44:57.863 --> 45:00.195
I know he's interested.

45:05.871 --> 45:10.365
It seems like they're trying
to make it impossible for folks to come back.

45:11.543 --> 45:13.204
What folks?

45:14.170 --> 45:16.161
My gang.

45:17.382 --> 45:19.748
They need someplace to live.

45:21.011 --> 45:24.253
My second chief, he got no place to stay.

45:24.389 --> 45:26.471
Living out there in his van.

45:26.600 --> 45:29.182
Ronnie got a place in the projects.

45:29.311 --> 45:31.768
It didn't flood, but they won't let him back in.

45:31.897 --> 45:36.607
Half my gang living like refugees
in their own country.

45:36.735 --> 45:40.978
Somebody needs to make a stand,
you know?

45:41.114 --> 45:43.446
Draw a line.

45:43.575 --> 45:45.190
Can I do something to help?

45:50.624 --> 45:52.910
You know what I really need you to do?

45:54.169 --> 45:55.750
Tell me.

45:58.423 --> 46:00.505
ls cut.

46:00.634 --> 46:04.252
Cut, cut, out while I sew, sew, sew.

46:05.430 --> 46:07.011
(Chuckles)

46:12.270 --> 46:14.886
Ah, that was a nice nap.

46:15.023 --> 46:17.264
— Did you like that?
- Mm-hm!

46:17.400 --> 46:19.982
I liked it so much, lwas thinking

46:20.111 --> 46:22.898
we might wanna catch another 40 winks.

46:23.031 --> 46:24.942
— I thought you had a gig.
- Mm-hm.

46:25.075 --> 46:27.487
What about ten winks?

46:28.912 --> 46:32.200
— Mm.
— Go on, get outta here.

46:32.332 --> 46:34.243
Mwah. Where's the tux?

46:34.376 --> 46:36.617
— I hung it on the closet door.
- All right.

46:42.968 --> 46:46.711
Hey, Desiree, why is the tux wet?

46:46.846 --> 46:48.711
It's just a little damp.

46:48.848 --> 46:50.930
I didn't wanna let it set in the dryer.

46:52.227 --> 46:53.888
You washed the tux?

46:54.020 --> 46:56.261
How else I'm supposed
to get the mess out of the front?

46:56.398 --> 46:59.265
Big, dried, ugly stain
like somebody threw up on it.

46:59.401 --> 47:01.517
A tuxedo's supposed to be dry—cleaned.

47:01.653 --> 47:04.520
Where I'm supposed to find
a goddamn dry—cleaner open?

47:04.656 --> 47:06.647
- Tssh.
— It's the goddamn weekend

47:06.783 --> 47:08.865
and we out here in the middle
of who—gives—a—fuck nowhere.

47:08.994 --> 47:10.154
Shit.

47:24.926 --> 47:26.917
(Phone ringing)

47:32.267 --> 47:34.258
(Ringing continues)

47:50.618 --> 47:52.609
(Ringing continues)

48:01.755 --> 48:04.371
(J‘ Fly Me To The Moon)

48:58.812 --> 49:01.975
How the fuck did Kermit hear about this gig?

49:05.360 --> 49:07.316
(All) J‘ Shallow water, oh Mama

49:07.445 --> 49:09.481

J‘ Shallow water, oh Mama

49:31.678 --> 49:33.669
J‘ A spy boy jumpin' at your front door

49:33.805 --> 49:36.137
Hold it over your head. There you go.

49:36.266 --> 49:38.006
No, no. You got to wave it.

49:38.143 --> 49:39.428
J‘ Shallow water, oh Mama J‘

49:39.561 --> 49:42.177
They got to see you.
They got to see you. Hold it up.

49:42.313 --> 49:43.564
J‘ Shallow water, oh Mama

49:43.690 --> 49:45.931
J‘ Tell your mom that nobody's home

49:46.067 --> 49:47.898
J‘ Shallow water, oh Mama

49:48.027 --> 49:49.892
J‘ Big Chief!
J‘ Big Chief ran for the Mardi Gras

J‘ Shallow water, oh Mama

49:51.698 --> 49:53.529
J‘ Got the second chief coming,

J‘ Hey, Lord, have mercy, pour down rain

J‘ Hoo—rah! Let it come.

(J‘ Band playing Take The A Train)

50:43.875 --> 50:47.163
Sounds like Take The Z Train to me.

50:47.295 --> 50:49.877
Little shiny—dome motherfucker.
Check it out.

50:50.006 --> 50:52.338
(Playing loudly)

51:07.357 --> 51:10.440
(Man) Blow your horn, son!

(Song ends)

51:20.828 --> 51:22.614

51:22.747 --> 51:24.283
That's how we do it in Treme.

51:24.415 --> 51:26.576
That's right, motherfucker.

51:31.673 --> 51:35.632
— Where's this from?
— The arresting officer's ticket book.

51:37.637 --> 51:40.174
"David M. Brooks." There it is.

51:40.306 --> 51:43.298
And from that ticket, Renee,
l was finally able to pull up

51:43.434 --> 51:45.925
a complaint history from the police computer

51:46.062 --> 51:48.303
which shows that David was arrested...

51:48.439 --> 51:53.479
arrested and locked up at OPP
just before the storm.

51:54.946 --> 51:57.528
— So what do you want me to do?
- Based on this new evidence,

51:57.657 --> 52:00.364
l'm filing for an emergency rehearing.

52:00.493 --> 52:02.575
OK, yeah.

52:02.704 --> 52:05.537
You could do the right thing
and make it a joint motion.

52:06.749 --> 52:08.831
We'll certainly sign the no objection.

52:08.960 --> 52:10.996
Listen, Renee, you haven't even
heard the topper.

52:11.129 --> 52:13.791
The bench warrant that got David locked up?

52:13.923 --> 52:15.709
That was a mistake.

52:15.842 --> 52:19.130
That was an old warrant that was left
in the police computer for months

52:19.262 --> 52:22.880
after David had satisfied
his obligations to the court.

52:23.016 --> 52:25.302
Everything that could fucking go wrong

52:25.435 --> 52:27.471
went wrong for this guy.

52:28.563 --> 52:31.475
I could really use a joint motion here.

52:32.650 --> 52:36.188
No joint motions on emergency hearings
for the time being.

52:37.613 --> 52:40.946
— Eddie's policy.
— Eddie's policy?

52:42.493 --> 52:44.404
An innocent man lost in the system

52:44.537 --> 52:46.653
for nearly six months.

52:56.382 --> 52:58.373
(Quiet chatter)

53:03.639 --> 53:06.551
— (Man) Who that?
— Chief.

53:07.477 --> 53:08.933
Mr. Newsome.

53:09.062 --> 53:12.475
- How you doing today, sir?
— I'm good. How you doing?

53:12.607 --> 53:13.938
I'm real good, real good.

53:14.067 --> 53:16.433
Looks like you all are gonna mask
for Mardi Gras, huh?

53:16.569 --> 53:18.400
- That's right.
— I'll be damned.

53:18.529 --> 53:21.441
— What can I do for you, sir?
— Well, I come by to let you know

53:21.574 --> 53:24.407
we were able to work a few things
on your behalf.

53:24.535 --> 53:26.571
The councilman hadn't forgot about you, sir.

53:26.704 --> 53:28.319
— Well, that's good to hear.
- Yes, sir.

53:28.456 --> 53:30.412
Now, don't spread this around too much,

53:30.541 --> 53:32.953
we don't want half the city
beating down our door,

53:33.086 --> 53:35.828
but, uh, we were able to get
a trailer for you, sir.

53:35.963 --> 53:39.046
- A FEMA trailer?
— Yes, sir. Brand—new.

53:42.261 --> 53:45.628
— How many trailers you got?
— Just the one, sir.

53:48.810 --> 53:53.304
I believe I asked your boss
about housing projects.

53:53.439 --> 53:56.397
— I believe that's what we discussed.
— No, Chief.

53:56.526 --> 54:00.519
The projects...that's not gonna happen.

54:00.655 --> 54:02.987
Now, all of that is federal.
That's out of our control.

54:03.116 --> 54:06.825
Now, the councilman went the extra mile
to make sure you got what you needed.

54:06.953 --> 54:08.739
A trailer?

54:09.914 --> 54:13.406
Y'all want me to put my gang

54:13.543 --> 54:16.410
in one FEMA trailer?

54:17.755 --> 54:20.212
Get the hell out this bar.

54:21.634 --> 54:23.590
Chief...

54:28.141 --> 54:31.053
Have it your way, Chief.

54:37.108 --> 54:38.814
I'd have took the trailer.

54:38.943 --> 54:40.899
Then I'd have kicked
his ass to the curb, me.

54:41.028 --> 54:44.191
— I'd have took it if it came with cable.

54:44.323 --> 54:46.575

55:01.257 --> 55:04.590

- Whoo!

55:13.144 --> 55:15.510
(Mimi) Oh, yes, yes!

55:16.606 --> 55:17.766
Yes!

55:24.113 --> 55:27.401
Ashley Morris, I salute you!

55:29.327 --> 55:30.692
Great human being,

55:30.828 --> 55:33.285
a true Bohemian in every sense of the word.

55:34.457 --> 55:36.994
I think that is a splendid idea.

55:37.126 --> 55:39.458
He can buy me back anytime.

55:42.173 --> 55:43.333
Vive la France!

55:54.685 --> 55:57.722
(Boy) Hey, Daddy. Pop!

55:57.855 --> 56:00.938
— Dad!
— Hey.

56:01.067 --> 56:03.399
— Hey, baby.
- Daddy.

56:03.528 --> 56:05.439
How you doing, Brantrell? How you doing?

56:05.571 --> 56:07.277
- Doing good?
— Yeah, I'm fine, man. You know.

56:07.406 --> 56:09.317
— How's your mama?
— She's good, she's fine.

56:09.450 --> 56:11.236
Yeah? Tell her I said hi, your sister too.

56:11.369 --> 56:14.406
— Yeah, yeah. Come see us.
— I will, |wi||.

56:14.539 --> 56:16.746
— All right, sweet, then.
- See you later.

56:31.931 --> 56:33.637
Hey!

56:33.766 --> 56:36.223
Oh, thank you.

56:37.395 --> 56:39.351
One of my students.

56:39.480 --> 56:42.267
May | see that? Oh, my goodness.

56:42.400 --> 56:45.483
You never know.
On a night like this I might get lucky.

56:45.611 --> 56:47.192
Might?

56:49.657 --> 56:53.696
— You make a lovely sperm.
- Thanks, I think.

56:53.828 --> 56:57.446
May | ask what changed your mind?

56:57.582 --> 57:00.119
Fuck those fucking fucks.

57:00.251 --> 57:01.991
I second that emotion.

57:02.128 --> 57:04.244
(Toni) Whoo—hoo!

57:05.548 --> 57:08.540
Where else could we ever live, huh?

57:10.428 --> 57:12.714
No place else.
