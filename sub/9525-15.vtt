charm the fuck out of the secretary.

15:13.046 --> 15:14.038
Oh!

15:14.204 --> 15:15.622
She'll probably tell us
where Justanna lives.

15:15.747 --> 15:16.856
Yeah, then we can tell 'em

15:16.981 --> 15:17.991
about that abusive boyfriend dude.

15:18.116 --> 15:19.526
That's right.

15:19.651 --> 15:20.727
And then we can have
Justanna move in with us,

15:20.852 --> 15:21.648
for at least Valentine's day.

15:21.773 --> 15:22.748
What? You're leaving?
No, stay.

15:22.873 --> 15:23.835
No, i thought
you would have left already.

15:23.960 --> 15:26.425
I thought i could leave,
but i was wrong.

15:26.591 --> 15:29.069
Mm! Drama.

15:29.194 --> 15:30.604
Girlfriend, please.

15:30.729 --> 15:32.098
Have you guys seen <i>Entourage?</i>

15:32.264 --> 15:34.267
His name's "drama," he's funny.

15:34.433 --> 15:35.242
I think he's, like, the funny one.

15:35.367 --> 15:36.477
Oh, my God.

15:36.643 --> 15:37.611
You guys.

15:37.736 --> 15:38.980
You guys, we had it all wrong.

15:39.146 --> 15:41.232
Realchixxxchat is like
a giant sex prison.

15:41.398 --> 15:42.282
Our plan just shape-shifted.

15:42.407 --> 15:43.484
We got to save these girls, man.

15:43.609 --> 15:44.918
We got to go find Anna,
and then we got

15:45.043 --> 15:47.280
to open up
a battered-women's shelter.

15:47.446 --> 15:49.223
- At our house, preferably.
- I say we split up,

15:49.348 --> 15:50.658
just in case one of us
gets caught or something.

15:50.824 --> 15:51.691
I'll go this way.
Psych.

15:51.816 --> 15:53.693
I'm going this way.
Justanna!

15:53.818 --> 15:55.413
Justanna!
Justanna!

15:55.579 --> 15:56.763
I saved your life.

15:56.888 --> 15:58.232
You're free! Run!

15:58.357 --> 15:59.733
Come on, you're free!
Get out of here!

15:59.858 --> 16:00.734
Justanna?

16:00.859 --> 16:01.961
Oh, hey!
Damn, girl.

16:02.127 --> 16:03.087
Hey, just...
oh, I'm sorry.

16:03.253 --> 16:04.630
Justanna?

16:04.796 --> 16:06.215
You're free to go, okay?
Get out of here.

16:06.381 --> 16:07.774
[Clears throat]
Excuse me,

16:07.899 --> 16:09.510
uh, I'm looking for Justanna.

16:09.676 --> 16:11.137
- I was gonna free her.
- Justanna?

16:11.303 --> 16:12.096
Yeah, i mean, I'll free you too.

16:12.262 --> 16:13.097
See, it's no big deal.

16:13.263 --> 16:14.432
- God, boy!
- Jeez!

16:14.598 --> 16:15.975
Get back here and suck my dick.

16:16.141 --> 16:17.184
- Justanna!
- Strong!

16:17.350 --> 16:19.604
You're free, go.
Go, tan!

16:19.770 --> 16:20.855
Go tan!
It's still sunny out!

16:21.021 --> 16:21.856
Holy shit!

16:22.022 --> 16:23.691
Suck it.

16:23.857 --> 16:24.758
Oh! Come on, let's go!

16:24.883 --> 16:25.985
You don't have to be here anymore.

16:26.151 --> 16:27.994
[Screams]
Hey! My show! My tips!

16:28.119 --> 16:29.429
- Motherfucker!
- Ow!

16:29.554 --> 16:32.366
- You get your ass out!
- Ow! Ow! Oh, Jesus!

16:32.532 --> 16:33.367
Justanna!

16:33.533 --> 16:35.402
- Oh!
- Justanna!

16:35.527 --> 16:37.288
Oh, my God! We're gonna
come back for you guys.

16:37.454 --> 16:38.738
We're gonna free those... you.

16:38.863 --> 16:41.083
- Justanna!
- Yeah, it's on now!

16:41.249 --> 16:42.276
Animals.

16:42.401 --> 16:44.478
- [Slow clapping]
- Were they chasing you?

16:44.603 --> 16:47.648
Justanna?

16:47.773 --> 16:48.716
Nope.

16:48.882 --> 16:50.593
Just me.

16:50.759 --> 16:51.818
Great job, fellas.

16:52.094 --> 16:53.720
Trespassing and possibly assault.

16:53.845 --> 16:55.348
Cops will love that.

16:55.514 --> 16:56.690
No, the cops are gonna love you.

16:56.815 --> 16:58.649
Because you're running
a sex trafficking business.

16:59.142 --> 17:00.194
Sex trafficking?

17:00.319 --> 17:01.562
I'm on the board of
the chamber of commerce, fellas.

17:01.728 --> 17:03.363
Well, then you let her out
of that chamber!

17:03.488 --> 17:05.365
Of commerce.

17:05.490 --> 17:06.666
Hey, look, man, all right?

17:06.791 --> 17:08.861
Justanna's our sweetheart, okay?

17:09.027 --> 17:10.320
She's everybody's sweetheart.

17:10.487 --> 17:12.114
We're not leaving without her.

17:12.280 --> 17:15.209
Okay, I'll call her in.

17:15.334 --> 17:16.410
Anna?

17:16.535 --> 17:17.877
[Busy signal beeping]

17:18.002 --> 17:19.479
Anna?

17:19.604 --> 17:21.214
I don't know how to work the phone.

17:21.339 --> 17:22.833
So maybe we should just go to her.

17:22.999 --> 17:24.218
Ooh, that's naughty.

17:24.343 --> 17:25.285
You're bad.

17:25.410 --> 17:27.354
- Here we go.
- Justanna!

17:27.479 --> 17:28.488
It's me! It's us!

17:28.755 --> 17:29.590
Hey! Hey!

17:29.756 --> 17:30.841
- Hands off!
- Okay.

17:31.115 --> 17:33.159
These guys came here
to rescue you, Anna.

17:33.284 --> 17:35.346
They said you're their sweetheart.

17:35.512 --> 17:37.464
What are you guys doing here?

17:37.589 --> 17:39.600
Uh...

17:39.725 --> 17:41.268
Well, if you must know,

17:41.393 --> 17:43.646
we think we're falling for you, babe.

17:43.812 --> 17:45.214
Like, in the love way.

17:45.339 --> 17:46.973
Blake, you guys don't even know me.

17:47.098 --> 17:49.376
I think we actually know
a lot about you.

17:49.501 --> 17:52.238
There's a little twinkle in your eye,

17:52.404 --> 17:54.782
you have those cute little glasses,

17:54.948 --> 17:56.617
and the way you smack your pussy.

17:56.783 --> 17:57.910
Okay, well, what you don't know is

17:58.076 --> 17:59.996
that three babies crawled
out of here.

18:00.162 --> 18:02.081
But what about
the paintings? Your art?

18:02.247 --> 18:04.208
You can't just flush
your dreams down the toilet.

18:04.374 --> 18:07.003
The art is just a gimmick.
Keith paints these.

18:07.169 --> 18:08.713
You like 'em, right?
Cool paintings?

18:08.879 --> 18:10.163
No, they're bad, they're terrible.

18:10.288 --> 18:12.925
It's like a stupid,
dumb baby drew 'em.

18:13.091 --> 18:15.068
- Oh, a dumb baby drew this?
- Dumb little baby.

18:15.193 --> 18:16.994
You're showing your ignorance
of composition.

18:17.429 --> 18:18.389
Okay, so we're here

18:18.555 --> 18:20.474
because you're the happiest,
most joyful person

18:20.640 --> 18:22.226
that we've ever shared
our lives with.

18:22.392 --> 18:24.145
And we want to share
the rest of our lives with you.

18:24.311 --> 18:26.230
I've been in and out
of psych wards my whole life.

18:26.396 --> 18:28.915
You guys just don't want to be alone

18:29.040 --> 18:31.068
on another Valentine's day.

18:31.234 --> 18:32.737
- [Chuckles]
- That's...

18:32.903 --> 18:34.613
- yeah, that's it, sure.
- Okay.

18:34.779 --> 18:37.223
I tell you what.

18:37.348 --> 18:40.453
How about tonight, and tonight only,

18:40.619 --> 18:44.398
i come, uh, hang out with you guys?

18:44.523 --> 18:47.934
What do you say?

18:48.210 --> 18:51.571
Three giant babies crawled
through that vagina hole?

18:51.696 --> 18:53.215
- Oh, man.
- Pass!

18:53.381 --> 18:54.441
And she was committed?

18:54.566 --> 18:56.302
So she's, like, a nuts person?

18:56.468 --> 18:58.345
Oh, yeah, let's not forget
the most important thing.

18:58.470 --> 18:59.805
She wasn't an artist, okay?

18:59.971 --> 19:00.947
Deal breaker.

19:01.072 --> 19:02.316
- Not for me.
- Right, sure.

19:02.441 --> 19:03.717
It was more the crazy thing

19:03.842 --> 19:05.978
and all the babies crawling
out of her vag.

19:06.210 --> 19:07.321
Thought she was an artist,
and she lied to us.

19:07.446 --> 19:09.190
Three gross little things.

19:09.356 --> 19:10.691
Can we get two kamikazes?

19:10.949 --> 19:12.292
But...

19:12.417 --> 19:15.738
She did teach us how to talk
to real chicks.

19:15.904 --> 19:18.164
Yeah. Yeah.

19:18.289 --> 19:20.993
Yo!
Hey, what's up?

19:21.159 --> 19:22.569
How about i intro you birds

19:22.694 --> 19:24.705
to my main man Der-kenstock
over there?

19:24.871 --> 19:25.772
Over here!

19:25.897 --> 19:27.249
We call him the plumber,

19:27.466 --> 19:31.277
because he will straight <i>fix</i>
your leaky pipes.

19:31.544 --> 19:33.589
He ain't lyin'.
Speaking of lion...

19:33.755 --> 19:35.482
My main man with the mane, ma'am,

19:35.607 --> 19:37.009
this is Blake, ma'am.

19:37.175 --> 19:38.260
Hung like a rhino,

19:38.426 --> 19:40.320
and educated about women's bodies,

19:40.445 --> 19:42.456
like a gyno... cologist.

19:42.581 --> 19:43.557
- Floop!
- That was good.

19:43.723 --> 19:45.267
That was really good, Ders.

19:45.433 --> 19:48.395
- "Like a gynecologist."
- That's a vaginal doctor.

19:48.520 --> 19:50.263
- Right.
- That's him.

19:50.388 --> 19:51.698
I can hear that, i can hear that.

19:51.823 --> 19:53.099
- That's checking out.
- Yeah, it is.

19:53.224 --> 19:56.654
And last, but <i>definitely</i> not gay...

19:56.820 --> 19:58.239
- Mm-mm.
- No can do.

19:58.405 --> 20:00.106
- Pew-pew! Pew-pew!
- We got Adam.

20:00.231 --> 20:02.326
And why don't you ladies
go ahead and give him a hand?

20:02.767 --> 20:04.411
Because he doesn't need one.

20:04.577 --> 20:06.413
Oh, we're doing that?
Oh, we're doing that right now?

20:06.538 --> 20:07.547
Bring it on, man.

20:07.672 --> 20:09.500
I think i can handle that.

20:09.666 --> 20:11.150
- [Groans]
- [Whistles]

20:11.275 --> 20:14.521
[Grunts]
Oh, I'm at half-mast already.

20:14.796 --> 20:16.656
- Get it, boy.
- Hoo! Hoo!

20:16.923 --> 20:18.692
Papa came to play.
Papa came to play.

20:18.967 --> 20:21.887
He's hands-free masturbating
in front of you.

20:22.053 --> 20:23.472
Oh, it's working!
It's actually...

20:23.638 --> 20:25.499
- oh!
- Whoa! Oh! Oh!

20:25.624 --> 20:26.517
All right.

20:26.683 --> 20:28.185
You got <i>me</i> wet.

20:28.351 --> 20:32.726
How about i return the Favreau, John?

20:32.851 --> 20:33.663
- Nice.
- Oh!

20:33.788 --> 20:36.330
- He's a direct...
- Hey, what are you doing?

20:36.455 --> 20:37.110
Whoa, man, okay.

20:37.235 --> 20:38.645
What do you say we just go home

20:38.770 --> 20:39.946
and boot up some porno?

20:40.071 --> 20:41.214
Yeah, I'd love to.

20:41.339 --> 20:42.533
We don't have a laptop, remember?

20:43.675 --> 20:46.844
<i>Wild Things</i> is on Starz at 8:50.

20:47.561 --> 20:50.416
- That's a date.
- It's been a while since we've seen it.
