Hey, that's a handicap spot.

01:02.797 --> 01:04.696
( playing keyboard )

01:04.698 --> 01:07.032
Ah, who's that?

01:07.034 --> 01:09.935
Look it.
He's hot.

01:15.742 --> 01:16.775
( gasps )

01:16.777 --> 01:18.610
Aah!

01:23.716 --> 01:25.918
Hey, Star.
I'm here to take you...

01:25.920 --> 01:28.787
to the Blood Moon Ball.

01:28.789 --> 01:30.756
Nope, nope, nope,
nope, nope.

01:30.758 --> 01:32.624
You need to leave
right now.

01:32.626 --> 01:35.661
Take your carriage and fire
and dead horse,

01:35.663 --> 01:37.729
and go back
to the underworld.

01:37.731 --> 01:39.598
Wait, I'm dead?

01:40.667 --> 01:43.068
Oh, come on, Starship.

01:43.070 --> 01:45.337
It's the Blood Moon Ball!

01:45.339 --> 01:50.209
It only happens once
every 667 years.

01:51.277 --> 01:52.711
We broke  <i>up!</i>

01:52.713 --> 01:54.079
Period!

01:54.081 --> 01:55.948
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Star, hang on.

01:55.950 --> 01:57.182
I'm a changed man, okay?

01:57.184 --> 01:58.884
I've got a life coach,
Brian.

01:58.886 --> 02:00.052
Hey.
He's awesome.

02:00.054 --> 02:01.353
A happy bunny.

02:01.355 --> 02:03.722
And, and, I have been
anger-free

02:03.724 --> 02:05.757
for 53 days.

02:05.759 --> 02:07.759
53?

02:07.761 --> 02:08.994
Don't you wanna
pet my bunny?

02:11.064 --> 02:13.765
Well, he is adorable.

02:13.767 --> 02:14.800
Hi-yah!
Oh!

02:16.269 --> 02:18.103
Back off, demon!
Marco!

02:18.105 --> 02:20.339
( growling )

02:20.341 --> 02:21.940
Oh, no.

02:21.942 --> 02:23.942
Walk it out
and talk it out.

02:23.944 --> 02:25.944
Walk it out
and talk it out.

02:25.946 --> 02:27.045
Walk it out...

02:27.047 --> 02:28.647
Uh, you better run.

02:28.649 --> 02:30.749
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Ha ha.

02:30.751 --> 02:32.284
No, no. Oh...

02:32.286 --> 02:34.987
Oh, that's why I got
my support system.

02:34.989 --> 02:37.956
I'm good.
Got the angries out!

02:37.958 --> 02:41.727
Everything is-- hoo--
under control.

02:41.729 --> 02:43.729
Marco, don't karate him.

02:43.731 --> 02:46.165
This is... Tom.

02:46.167 --> 02:47.833
Demon ex-boyfriend Tom?

02:47.835 --> 02:50.836
Nice to, uh, meet you,
Marco.

02:50.838 --> 02:52.771
What is he doing here?

02:52.773 --> 02:55.741
He wants to take me
to the Blood Moon Ball.

02:55.743 --> 02:57.342
Star, never go
with a predator

02:57.344 --> 02:58.744
to a second location.

02:58.746 --> 03:00.512
Look, I can see you're mad.

03:00.514 --> 03:01.914
You think I'm a total jerk.

03:01.916 --> 03:03.916
I get it.
But I have changed.

03:03.918 --> 03:07.719
Remember, I'm not
the only one with horns.

03:07.721 --> 03:10.689
Why didn't you tell me
I'm dead?

03:10.691 --> 03:12.758
( making karate-like groans )

03:12.760 --> 03:15.694
No pressure. If you decide
you want to go,

03:15.696 --> 03:17.262
just toll this bell.

03:17.264 --> 03:19.865
( flames whooshing )

03:19.867 --> 03:22.434
Oops, almost forgot
the little hammer.

03:22.436 --> 03:24.102
I hope I see you there.

03:28.141 --> 03:30.175
You're making
a big mistake, Star.

03:30.177 --> 03:33.178
Maybe, but it could
be fun.

03:33.180 --> 03:34.780
Why don't you just
stay here,

03:34.782 --> 03:37.349
where it's always fun?

03:37.351 --> 03:38.984
Like, guaranteed.

03:38.986 --> 03:42.354
Well, this is
a different kind of fun.

03:42.356 --> 03:43.889
Don't look.
I'm gonna change.

03:43.891 --> 03:46.124
I just don't trust Tom.

03:46.126 --> 03:47.292
Maybe I should go with you.

03:47.294 --> 03:49.294
Marco, you weren't
invited.

03:49.296 --> 03:52.097
Besides, you gotta trust me
to do the right thing for my--

03:52.099 --> 03:54.933
Self-aaah...

03:54.935 --> 03:56.168
Are you okay?

03:56.170 --> 03:58.870
Yeah, totally,
totally, totally.

03:58.872 --> 04:00.939
I just gotta stop
using magic on--

04:00.941 --> 04:02.908
on-- on my face.

04:02.910 --> 04:05.143
All I'm saying
is guys like Tom

04:05.145 --> 04:06.845
never change.

04:06.847 --> 04:10.882
Well, there's only one way
for me to find out.

04:10.884 --> 04:12.951
What do you think?

04:15.755 --> 04:18.090
You look amazing.

04:18.092 --> 04:19.825
Thanks, Marco.

04:19.827 --> 04:20.926
( strained whisper )
Don't go.

04:20.928 --> 04:24.463
( whispering )
I'm totally going.

04:24.465 --> 04:26.298
( deep, resonant gong )

04:33.106 --> 04:34.106
Mmm.

04:34.108 --> 04:35.474
Smells like burnt toast.

04:35.476 --> 04:38.277
Let's get this show
on the road!

04:38.279 --> 04:40.979
Which floor, mortal?

04:40.981 --> 04:43.915
Uh, I guess the bottom.

04:43.917 --> 04:45.083
Let me just
ride down with you.

04:45.085 --> 04:46.551
Good-bye, Marco.

04:46.553 --> 04:50.122
See you after
the  <i>Blood Moon Ball.</i>

04:50.124 --> 04:52.524
<i>Oooooh...</i>

04:52.526 --> 04:53.492
( groaning )

04:53.494 --> 04:55.527
( flames wooshing )

04:57.530 --> 04:59.264
( groaning )

04:59.266 --> 05:01.533
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Okay, guys.

05:01.535 --> 05:03.235
I don't know what
you're about to do,

05:03.237 --> 05:05.937
but I want to keep things
low-key for Star.

05:05.939 --> 05:08.874
into a greeting card
holiday, go ahead.

05:08.876 --> 05:10.842
Wait, which one of you
said that?

05:10.844 --> 05:12.144
Me.

05:12.146 --> 05:13.945
No, okay, whoever
was just talking,

05:13.947 --> 05:15.247
raise your hand.

05:15.249 --> 05:19.851
Master Tom, Princess Butterfly
has arrived.

05:21.054 --> 05:22.120
Wow.

05:24.490 --> 05:27.959
Star Butterfly.
Don't you clean up nice!

05:27.961 --> 05:30.896
Uh, thank you...
I guess.

05:30.898 --> 05:32.230
I got you this.
What is it?

05:32.232 --> 05:34.833
It's a hair thing.
It goes in your hair.

05:34.835 --> 05:36.168
It'll help you
fit in down here.

05:36.170 --> 05:39.104
How sweet, Tom.
but, yeah.

05:39.106 --> 05:41.540
I kinda got
my on thing going on here.

05:41.542 --> 05:43.975
I'm pretty happy with it.
Let's go have fun now.

05:43.977 --> 05:45.577
( angry groan )

05:45.579 --> 05:49.915
You can be positive
that your anger is negative.

05:51.150 --> 05:54.586
( music playing on radio )

05:58.591 --> 06:01.026
I'll have my own
Blood Moon Ball

06:01.028 --> 06:05.964
in Star's bedroom,
where it's always fun.

06:11.137 --> 06:14.039
MAN'S VOICE:
Blood moon tonight.

06:21.647 --> 06:24.015
VOICE:
The moon of lovers.

06:34.594 --> 06:36.628
( eerily )
Smile.

06:36.630 --> 06:41.233
( both groaning )

06:41.235 --> 06:43.502
Beautiful.

06:45.338 --> 06:47.572
I'm so excited to be
covered in blood with you.

06:47.574 --> 06:50.142
But don't worry, it's not real.
It's from a unicorn.

06:50.144 --> 06:51.309
My best friend
is a unicorn.

06:51.311 --> 06:53.078
Well, they're not related.

06:53.080 --> 06:55.247
I'm not gonna bathe
in unicorn blood, Tom.

06:55.249 --> 06:56.948
( stifled angry groan )

06:56.950 --> 06:58.583
What's that hand doing
back there?

06:58.585 --> 07:01.319
Nothing.
Whoa, wait a second.

07:01.321 --> 07:03.989
Are you getting angry?
No.

07:03.991 --> 07:07.459
Look, you do you, Boo,
I'm gonna go get a drink.

07:07.461 --> 07:10.095
STAR:
Here he comes again.

07:10.097 --> 07:11.129
Hello, Henry.

07:11.131 --> 07:12.564
His name is Henry.

07:12.566 --> 07:14.433
You must be
Tom's date.

07:14.435 --> 07:15.500
I guess I am.

07:15.502 --> 07:16.701
Well, I hope you're happy.

07:16.703 --> 07:18.470
He made this whole
entire ball

07:18.472 --> 07:20.539
completely boring,
all for you.

07:20.541 --> 07:22.040
I wouldn't say
it's boring.

07:22.042 --> 07:25.644
Aloof attractive people.
Boring!

07:25.646 --> 07:28.246
Bubbling cauldrons that
don't even melt your flesh off.

07:28.248 --> 07:29.581
What is it,
nap time or something?

07:29.583 --> 07:31.316
'Cause I'm bored.

07:31.318 --> 07:34.085
Piece of garbage that
doesn't destroy the universe.

07:34.087 --> 07:36.087
Stupid cockroach
that lives inside.

07:36.089 --> 07:37.556
I'm over it already.

07:37.558 --> 07:41.059
( screaming, sobbing )

07:41.061 --> 07:42.360
You wanna dance?

07:42.362 --> 07:44.062
Her dance card's full.

07:44.064 --> 07:46.264
Oh, I get it.
I bet you think that, like,

07:46.266 --> 07:49.100
your soul, and, like,
her soul

07:49.102 --> 07:51.970
are totally gonna...
mmmmmm!

07:51.972 --> 07:55.040
What is "mmmmmm"?

07:55.042 --> 07:57.108
( speaker feedback,
clears throat )

07:57.110 --> 08:00.312
Good evening,
ladiesngennlebremen.

08:00.314 --> 08:03.215
It is my pleasure
that I request you now

08:03.217 --> 08:06.117
<i>to turn your heads skyward</i>

08:06.119 --> 08:09.087
when the light of the
blood moon drupples down,

08:09.089 --> 08:11.289
and selects
two lucky souls,

08:11.291 --> 08:14.159
binding them together
for eternity

08:14.161 --> 08:18.230
in its hypnotic,
ruby brodum.

08:18.232 --> 08:19.764
Whoa.

08:19.766 --> 08:22.701
( eerie organ music playing )

08:22.703 --> 08:24.703
Oh! That's the wrong
piece of music!

08:24.705 --> 08:26.505
This is gonna
drive me crazy.

08:26.507 --> 08:28.340
All right, don't go anywhere.
I'll be right back.

08:28.342 --> 08:30.175
Okay.

08:30.177 --> 08:32.177
Ooh.

08:34.080 --> 08:35.146
( hushed tone )
Star.

08:37.483 --> 08:40.051
( whispering )
Star. Star!

08:41.554 --> 08:43.522
( all gasp)

08:48.594 --> 08:50.095
Oh!

08:50.097 --> 08:53.198
( music playing )

08:56.669 --> 08:58.436
( gasps )

08:58.438 --> 09:00.138
( angry groan )

09:00.140 --> 09:01.706
Star...

09:01.708 --> 09:04.075
How did you know my name?

09:04.077 --> 09:06.144
It's me, Marco.

09:06.146 --> 09:07.445
( gasps )
Marco?

09:07.447 --> 09:08.580
What are you doing here?

09:08.582 --> 09:09.748
Let's get outta here.

09:09.750 --> 09:11.082
This place is the worst.

09:11.084 --> 09:12.217
( angry growl )

09:23.095 --> 09:27.065
That dance was meant
<i>for me!</i>

09:31.103 --> 09:33.238
Walk it out...
No, Brian!

09:38.444 --> 09:40.211
( demonic roar )

09:49.155 --> 09:51.256
Let's go, Marco.

09:54.093 --> 09:56.261
( flames whooshing )

09:57.697 --> 10:00.165
( bell dings)

10:00.167 --> 10:02.100
Thanks for the lift.

10:03.235 --> 10:05.337
Ugh! So infuriating.

10:05.339 --> 10:08.173
I hate to say it,
but I warned you about Tom.

10:08.175 --> 10:11.776
No, you!
You're infuriating.

10:11.778 --> 10:13.478
Me? I was just
trying to help.

10:13.480 --> 10:16.147
You don't trust me
to do things by myself.

10:16.149 --> 10:20.251
I'm 14.
I can handle a demon.

10:20.253 --> 10:23.154
I know you're trying
to look out for me,

10:23.156 --> 10:26.291
but you have to let me
figure things out on my own.

10:26.293 --> 10:29.661
I don't nee a hero.
I need a friend.

10:35.468 --> 10:36.768
( sighs )
You're right.

10:36.770 --> 10:38.703
I should have
trusted you.

10:38.705 --> 10:41.439
I'm sorry
I ruined your night.

10:41.441 --> 10:45.543
Well, it wasn't
a total disaster.

10:45.545 --> 10:48.313
Now I know
you can dance.

10:48.315 --> 10:49.581
( both chuckle )

10:49.583 --> 10:51.316
Hat hair. Whoa!
Hat hair. Whoa!

10:51.318 --> 10:52.517
We both said--
We both said--

10:52.519 --> 10:53.785
The same thing.
The same thing.

10:53.787 --> 10:54.919
Okay, stop that.
Okay, stop that.

10:54.921 --> 10:56.321
( both gasp )

10:58.190 --> 10:59.257
( stifled laugh )

10:59.259 --> 11:01.926
( both laughing )

11:01.928 --> 11:03.395
Well, that was new.

11:03.397 --> 11:04.696
Yeah, weird.

11:04.698 --> 11:06.464
Now go make me
some nachos!

11:06.466 --> 11:08.933
MARCO:
Okay.

11:11.337 --> 11:13.571
( pained cries )

11:13.573 --> 11:15.507
How are you losing?

11:15.509 --> 11:18.343
You guys have, like,
200 pounds on her!

11:18.345 --> 11:19.878
( crying )

11:19.880 --> 11:23.314
At least hit her
with a rock or something!

11:23.316 --> 11:24.883
( growling )

11:24.885 --> 11:26.251
( frustrated groan )

11:26.253 --> 11:27.719
Whoo-hoo!

11:27.721 --> 11:29.587
Off the cactus,
over the tree.

11:29.589 --> 11:31.256
Nothing but net!

11:32.525 --> 11:33.858
Unh!

11:33.860 --> 11:36.294
Told you I could do it.

11:36.296 --> 11:38.263
( all growling )

11:38.265 --> 11:39.297
Double or nothing.

11:39.299 --> 11:42.233
One kick,
seven monsters.

11:42.235 --> 11:43.768
Hyah!

11:43.770 --> 11:45.570
Noooo!

11:45.572 --> 11:47.539
After a victory
like this,

11:47.541 --> 11:49.507
there's only
one thing to do.

11:49.509 --> 11:51.309
Get Chinese food!

11:51.311 --> 11:53.278
Ooh, Chinese food!

11:53.280 --> 11:56.347
I have no idea
what that is.

11:56.349 --> 11:59.250
( groaning )

11:59.252 --> 12:01.319
( angry cries )

12:01.321 --> 12:03.621
( screaming )

12:03.623 --> 12:06.491
You guys are useless!

12:06.493 --> 12:08.960
( groaning )

12:08.962 --> 12:10.595
( squeaking indistinctly )

12:10.597 --> 12:13.465
You're always screwing up
my brilliant plans.

12:13.467 --> 12:16.434
I need someone who can wrangle
you imbeciles.

12:16.436 --> 12:18.636
Oh, go get change!

12:18.638 --> 12:21.306
( bubbling )

12:21.308 --> 12:22.674
Delicious.

12:22.676 --> 12:25.910
And it's so fun eating
with these tiny wands.

12:25.912 --> 12:29.280
( "pew pew" shooting noises )

12:29.282 --> 12:30.849
Oh, and there's cookies, too.

12:33.452 --> 12:34.986
I don't like the filling.

12:34.988 --> 12:37.255
These are fortune cookies.

12:37.257 --> 12:40.325
They can
magically predict the future.

12:40.327 --> 12:42.861
What? No way.

12:42.863 --> 12:44.929
"A friend will greet you
with a smile."

12:44.931 --> 12:46.931
Aww, how sweet.

12:46.933 --> 12:47.932
( gasping )

12:47.934 --> 12:50.835
See, the cookies know all.

12:50.837 --> 12:53.838
No, it can't be.

12:53.840 --> 12:56.641
"Think positive and good luck
will come your way."

12:58.277 --> 12:59.477
( excited shouting )
More cookies!

12:59.479 --> 13:01.513
They're stale.
Gimme!

13:01.515 --> 13:03.882
You're a weird girl.

13:03.884 --> 13:06.951
Wow, Star. Good luck
did come your way.

13:06.953 --> 13:08.286
It did, it did.

13:08.288 --> 13:09.554
These are incredible.

13:10.589 --> 13:11.956
Star?

13:14.059 --> 13:16.294
APPLICANT:
Eh, previous job experience?

13:16.296 --> 13:18.797
Nope. No one's ever been
dumb enough to hire me.

13:18.799 --> 13:20.865
Weaknesses? I don't have any.

13:20.867 --> 13:21.866
( blergh )

13:21.868 --> 13:23.301
How am I under pressure?

13:23.303 --> 13:24.335
Awesome!

13:24.337 --> 13:25.503
LUDO:
Hmm, is that so?

13:25.505 --> 13:27.739
Ah, yeah, um, why?

13:27.741 --> 13:29.474
Did you hear otherwise?

13:29.476 --> 13:31.910
I can't take it anymore!
( screaming )

13:31.912 --> 13:33.978
APPLICANT:
Where do I see myself
in ten years?

13:33.980 --> 13:36.948
Oh, we're best friends,
and we hang out all the time

13:36.950 --> 13:39.317
sharing feelings
and holding hands.

13:39.319 --> 13:41.686
( incomprehensible garbling )

13:41.688 --> 13:43.721
You make absolutely no sense.

13:43.723 --> 13:44.756
Go away.

13:44.758 --> 13:47.926
Soft. So soft.

13:47.928 --> 13:48.927
LUDO:
Next!

13:48.929 --> 13:50.061
LUDO:
Next!

13:50.063 --> 13:51.062
LUDO:
Next!

13:51.064 --> 13:52.497
LUDO:
Next!

13:52.499 --> 13:56.534
These idiots are even dumber
than you idiots.

13:59.471 --> 14:01.539
West Mewnin swamp water.

14:01.541 --> 14:03.441
Or, do you drink
from the bottle?

14:03.443 --> 14:05.710
On days like this...

14:05.712 --> 14:07.445
Tell me about it.

14:07.447 --> 14:09.547
Oh, I'll tell you... ( garbled )

14:09.549 --> 14:13.451
I've been trying to steal
a wand from a teenager.

14:13.453 --> 14:15.119
It's harder than it ought to be.

14:15.121 --> 14:17.055
Wait a second.

14:19.592 --> 14:20.959
Where did you come from?

14:20.961 --> 14:22.894
I let myself in.
When?

14:22.896 --> 14:25.530
After you hired me.
I hired you?

14:25.532 --> 14:26.698
I accept.

14:26.700 --> 14:27.999
Excellent.

14:29.435 --> 14:31.102
MAN:
We'll start tomorrow.

14:31.104 --> 14:33.137
Get some rest.

14:33.139 --> 14:34.505
LUDO:
Uhh...

14:34.507 --> 14:36.841
Did anybody catch his name?

14:39.545 --> 14:40.545
Toffee?

14:40.547 --> 14:43.381
I guess his name is Toffee.

14:43.383 --> 14:45.550
( birds chirping )

14:45.552 --> 14:48.386
Oh, wise and powerful cookies,

14:48.388 --> 14:51.489
bestow your sugary prophecies
upon me.

14:51.491 --> 14:52.490
Ehh...

14:52.492 --> 14:53.458
Gotcha, Star.

14:53.460 --> 14:55.159
Those fortunes aren't magic.

14:55.161 --> 14:57.462
They're put there
by people in a factory.

14:57.464 --> 14:59.397
Next you'll tell me
that's how they get

14:59.399 --> 15:01.199
the snow in snow globes.

15:01.201 --> 15:03.568
It's clear they're the work
of dark wizards.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.703
I'm serious. They're not real.

15:05.705 --> 15:08.139
They're just vague so you can
read things into them.

15:09.508 --> 15:12.110
"An unexpected visitor
will soon arrive."

15:16.482 --> 15:17.548
See?

15:17.550 --> 15:18.750
No one's here.

15:18.752 --> 15:20.718
Now, who wants nachos?

15:20.720 --> 15:22.520
Did someone say nachos?

15:22.522 --> 15:26.190
Well, hello,
my unexpected visitor.

15:26.192 --> 15:28.927
Ferguson, Star thinks
fortune cookies are magical.

15:28.929 --> 15:30.561
Will you please tell
her they're not?

15:30.563 --> 15:32.063
Now, whoa, man. Whoa.

15:32.065 --> 15:33.498
Cookies are magical.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.700
Once, I ate one
from the floor of a cab,

15:35.702 --> 15:37.735
and I met my spirit animal
that night.

15:37.737 --> 15:39.504
It was a wolf.

15:41.473 --> 15:44.475
Why are you suddenly
a non-believer?

15:44.477 --> 15:47.178
"Reach for the stars
and achieve your dream."

15:47.180 --> 15:48.513
( groaning )

15:48.515 --> 15:49.480
( screaming )

15:49.482 --> 15:51.549
( alarmed yelling )

15:51.551 --> 15:52.717
Huh?

15:52.719 --> 15:54.185
Pegasus feathers.

15:54.187 --> 15:57.655
I have always dreamed
of having a skylight in here.

15:57.657 --> 15:59.157
( groaning )

15:59.159 --> 16:01.225
Blindly following
these fortune cookies

16:01.227 --> 16:03.594
is the best decision
I've ever made.

16:03.596 --> 16:05.163
Can you give me a hand?

16:07.499 --> 16:09.500
Yes.

16:09.502 --> 16:13.638
Okay, Toffee,
I'm going to show you
what we're working with here.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.139
♪ This is my house,
this is my house ♪

16:15.141 --> 16:16.641
♪ This is my...
my house ♪

16:16.643 --> 16:18.476

( yelling )

16:22.849 --> 16:24.649
( groaning, screaming )

16:26.518 --> 16:27.986
Guess I'm doomed, huh?

16:27.988 --> 16:30.888
Be honest. I can handle it.
Ludo, Master.

16:30.890 --> 16:35.159
The girl thinks the messages
in her cookies are fortunes.

16:35.161 --> 16:36.694
She does whatever they say.

16:36.696 --> 16:38.529
Interrupting!

16:39.732 --> 16:41.566
Well, Toffee.
Give it to me straight.

16:41.568 --> 16:43.735
Are my monsters the worst ever,
or what?

16:43.737 --> 16:45.103
Uh...

16:45.105 --> 16:47.538
( groaning, cracking )

16:47.540 --> 16:50.875
Oh, man. It's stuck.

16:50.877 --> 16:56.514
Maybe we can do something
with those fortune cookies.

16:56.516 --> 16:58.549
What? What is... what, what?

16:58.551 --> 17:00.551
You sure you trust him, boss?

17:00.553 --> 17:02.120
Of course.

17:05.157 --> 17:07.125
Oh, last cookie.

17:07.127 --> 17:09.660
I can't wait to get more.

17:09.662 --> 17:10.995
Star, I'm telling you,

17:10.997 --> 17:12.964
they'll back me up
at the restaurant.

17:12.966 --> 17:15.066
Food can't predict the future.

17:15.068 --> 17:16.701
Sure it can.

17:16.703 --> 17:18.936
On Mewni, there's a place
where you can get calzones

17:18.938 --> 17:20.571
that'll tell you
how you're going to die.

17:22.041 --> 17:24.909
You will die from choking
on a calzone.

17:24.911 --> 17:27.545
Just kidding.
Heh heh.

17:27.547 --> 17:29.914
A giant's going to sit
on your face.

17:29.916 --> 17:31.983
♪

17:31.985 --> 17:35.019
♪ My house, my house

17:35.988 --> 17:37.989
What are they doing?
Shh.

17:37.991 --> 17:40.658
I think one of them's
about to get served.

17:40.660 --> 17:42.593
♪ This is my house,
this is my... ♪

17:46.598 --> 17:48.032
Well done.

( growling )

17:55.140 --> 17:56.908
Fooled you, ha ha ha!

17:56.910 --> 17:58.676
Hi-ya--
Hold on.

17:58.678 --> 18:02.013
"Love is always the answer."
Hmm.

18:02.015 --> 18:04.715
What?! Not in this case.
Fighting is.

18:04.717 --> 18:07.652
Sorry, Marco.
It's not the will of the cookie.

18:07.654 --> 18:09.821
Really? Now? Whoa!

18:12.925 --> 18:14.725
Hugs.

18:17.796 --> 18:19.664
There's the wand.

18:19.666 --> 18:20.798
I can totally grab it.

18:20.800 --> 18:22.733
Patience.

18:22.735 --> 18:23.768
( sad moan )

18:23.770 --> 18:25.269
Hi-ya!
( clucks )

18:30.742 --> 18:32.777
Star, forgot
that stupid fortune.

18:32.779 --> 18:33.845
Help me!

18:33.847 --> 18:34.979
Sparkle, don't fight.

18:34.981 --> 18:36.781
Then they'll stop fighting you.

18:36.783 --> 18:39.650
STAR:
Trust the cookie.
( laughing )

18:39.652 --> 18:41.185
MARCO:
Hey, let me out!

18:41.187 --> 18:42.787
Hey, hey!

18:42.789 --> 18:45.790
You guys really need some hugs.

18:45.792 --> 18:47.925
It's actually working.

18:49.728 --> 18:51.996
Love is always the answer.

18:51.998 --> 18:53.965
( excited yelping )
There it is!

18:53.967 --> 18:55.199
Out of my way!

18:55.201 --> 18:56.701
( excited squealing )

18:56.703 --> 18:58.936
Mine! Mine!

18:58.938 --> 19:02.206
Yes! Yes! Yes!
Back off, dude.

19:02.208 --> 19:04.775
I've been waiting for this
since middle school.

19:04.777 --> 19:09.147
You idiots
are screwing up the plan.

19:09.149 --> 19:11.649
Plan?

19:11.651 --> 19:12.750
Huh?

19:12.752 --> 19:15.720
( sighs )

19:15.722 --> 19:18.322
Okay, look, Star.
This is really hard to say,

19:18.324 --> 19:19.957
but, if this is going to go
any further,

19:19.959 --> 19:22.059
I want our relationship
to have a foundation of honesty.

19:22.061 --> 19:23.094
Me, too.

19:23.096 --> 19:24.962
So confused.

19:24.964 --> 19:26.764
Fortune cookies aren't real.

19:26.766 --> 19:28.766
It was all a trap so Ludo
could steal your wand.

19:28.768 --> 19:30.301
( panicked squeals )

19:30.303 --> 19:31.702
Anyway, I hope--

19:31.704 --> 19:33.671
We hope...

19:33.673 --> 19:35.907
We hope
this isn't a deal breaker.

19:39.778 --> 19:42.246
You know what this means,
don't you, Star?

19:42.248 --> 19:43.781
Oh, yeah.

19:43.783 --> 19:45.683
Love is never the answer.

19:45.685 --> 19:48.753
Oh, man. I wanted to say it.

19:48.755 --> 19:50.988
Mega mushroom destruction blast.

19:50.990 --> 19:52.056
( whimpering )

19:53.125 --> 19:54.325
( screaming )

20:04.803 --> 20:06.270
Welcome to my life.

20:08.040 --> 20:11.309
( groaning )
Sorry, I should have
listened to you.

20:11.311 --> 20:13.945
Obviously you know better
than a dessert.

20:13.947 --> 20:15.346
No, it's my fault.

20:15.348 --> 20:17.148
I shouldn't
have messed with you

20:17.150 --> 20:19.317
and said those fortunes
were magical in the first place.

20:19.319 --> 20:20.318
( door opening )

20:20.320 --> 20:21.953
Oh, weird perky girl.

20:21.955 --> 20:23.721
You want some more
stale cookies?

20:23.723 --> 20:25.723
Who could say no to that?

20:28.293 --> 20:31.062
( chuckles )
What? They're not real fortunes,

20:31.064 --> 20:33.431
but they're still real cookies.

20:35.067 --> 20:37.735
"A great evil
has been unleashed."

20:37.737 --> 20:39.437
BOTH:
Ooooohh.

20:41.873 --> 20:43.407
Cheers.

20:44.743 --> 20:47.111
That was the closest
we've ever come,

20:47.113 --> 20:50.281
but that girl
always gets the best of me.

20:50.283 --> 20:52.850
Yes, well,
you're not the first monster

20:52.852 --> 20:54.885
to fall victim to their magic.
