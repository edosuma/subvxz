00:01.102 --> 00:01.202
.

00:06.507 --> 00:07.408
- In the criminal justice
system,

00:09.110 --> 00:10.511
sexually based offenses

00:10.544 --> 00:12.346
are considered
especially heinous.

00:12.380 --> 00:14.382
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:14.415 --> 00:16.250
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:16.284 --> 00:17.785
are members of an elite squad

00:17.818 --> 00:19.553
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:19.587 --> 00:21.489
These are their stories.

00:21.522 --> 00:23.357
[dramatic sting]

00:23.391 --> 00:26.127
- Sergeant Tutuola.
See, that wasn't so bad, was it?

00:26.160 --> 00:28.562
- I hate tests.
- Even when you pass?

00:28.596 --> 00:30.564
- Well, a little less then.

00:30.598 --> 00:32.366
- You know, I am gonna
miss you, Fin,

00:32.400 --> 00:35.469
because they transfer
new sergeants to patrol.

00:35.503 --> 00:37.271
- But first,
they gotta get appointed,

00:37.305 --> 00:38.606
and that may not happen
for a while.

00:38.639 --> 00:41.142
I'm number 622 on the list.
- What?

00:41.175 --> 00:43.477
- I didn't get
a perfect score.

00:43.511 --> 00:45.613
- Hey, sorry if I'm late.

00:45.646 --> 00:47.315
My babysitter didn't show.

00:47.348 --> 00:49.083
I had to park Jesse
with my sister.

00:49.117 --> 00:50.651
- Look, maybe Lucy
can pick her up

00:50.684 --> 00:52.220
after she drops Noah
at preschool.

00:52.253 --> 00:53.421
Do you want me
to call her?

00:53.454 --> 00:55.323
- Yes, please.

00:55.356 --> 00:57.258
- Hey, where's everybody been?
It's just been me and

00:57.291 --> 00:59.160
the Congressman over here.
- The Congressman?

00:59.193 --> 01:00.528
- Yeah, he walked in
half an hour ago.

01:00.561 --> 01:02.330
He's been waiting
in your office.

01:02.363 --> 01:04.132
- A congressman waiting around
for a half hour?

01:04.165 --> 01:05.433
- He must really want your vote.

01:05.466 --> 01:07.201
- Okay, what does he
really want?

01:07.235 --> 01:10.138
- Wants to talk to you.
That's what he said.

01:15.343 --> 01:17.145
- Lieutenant, I'm Luke Bolton.

01:17.178 --> 01:18.312
- Yes, of course,
I know who you are.

01:18.346 --> 01:20.214
How can I help you?

01:20.248 --> 01:22.316
- You may not be aware, but,
according to the Internet,

01:22.350 --> 01:24.685
I'm a customer of an underage
sex trafficking ring

01:24.718 --> 01:27.588
run out of a Chinese restaurant
called the Coral Dragon.

01:27.621 --> 01:29.890
- You are?
- No, I'm not.

01:29.923 --> 01:32.593
But facts don't seem
to matter nowadays.

01:32.626 --> 01:36.464
It's fake news, but a lot
of people seem to believe it.

01:36.497 --> 01:38.232
- People on the Internet.

01:38.266 --> 01:40.201
- They're real people,
but they've drawn

01:40.234 --> 01:42.403
some crazy conclusions
from my emails.

01:42.436 --> 01:45.906
I got hacked.
- Yeah, I heard about it.

01:45.939 --> 01:47.608
The NYPD got hacked as well.

01:47.641 --> 01:52.180
I've had to change my password
about five times.

01:52.213 --> 01:55.483
I still get nervous
every time I log on.

01:55.516 --> 01:57.385
- I wish that were
the only problem here.

01:57.418 --> 01:58.619
It's a dangerous situation.

01:58.652 --> 02:00.654
The owner has received threats.

02:00.688 --> 02:02.656
- Okay, that's not good, but--
- I just put out a statement,

02:02.690 --> 02:04.925
but I'm afraid I've only
made the situation worse.

02:04.958 --> 02:07.395
If you could send someone
to take a look at the place--

02:07.428 --> 02:09.897
the teenage sex slaves
are supposedly held captive

02:09.930 --> 02:12.600
in the basement--and establish
that it's not true.

02:12.633 --> 02:14.435
- Would anyone believe it?

02:14.468 --> 02:17.371
- One hopes the NYPD is
still a trusted institution.

02:17.405 --> 02:18.706
- It's nice to think so.

02:18.739 --> 02:20.941
- This is an alleged sex crime.

02:20.974 --> 02:24.545
You investigate alleged
sex crimes, don't you?

02:24.578 --> 02:26.347
- Yes, we do.

02:29.783 --> 02:32.386
[dramatic sting]

02:32.420 --> 02:34.588
- I guess we can pick up
some General Tso's chicken

02:34.622 --> 02:36.290
while we're here, at least.

02:36.324 --> 02:38.226
- Yeah, Rollins wants
some sesame noodles.

02:38.259 --> 02:40.561
- Yeah, maybe tomorrow,
we can investigate Italian.

02:44.698 --> 02:47.368
Mr. Lee?
- Yes, Detectives.

02:47.401 --> 02:49.270
The Congressman
told me you were coming.

02:49.303 --> 02:51.305
I hope you can help us.
- I honestly don't know if

02:51.339 --> 02:52.640
we're going to be able
to help, Mr. Lee.

02:52.673 --> 02:54.308
- I've been getting
death threats.

02:54.342 --> 02:56.210
My employees are getting
death threats.

02:56.244 --> 02:57.945
- Okay, we can pass that along
to the other detectives.

02:57.978 --> 02:59.680
In the meantime, why don't you
show us around and--

02:59.713 --> 03:01.715
- You! Where are they?
- He's got a gun!

03:01.749 --> 03:03.351
[people screaming]

03:03.384 --> 03:04.985
The girls--where?

03:05.018 --> 03:06.687
- I don't know--
what girls?

03:06.720 --> 03:09.457
- The girls in the basement,
the ones for sale.

03:09.490 --> 03:13.694
Everybody stay calm and easy!
I'm not here to hurt nobody!

03:13.727 --> 03:15.563
Just show me and let them go.

03:15.596 --> 03:17.631
- Okay, why don't you
put that gun down,

03:17.665 --> 03:19.700
and then he'll show you around?
- Ain't your business, buddy.

03:19.733 --> 03:22.670
- Yes, it is.
I'm a police officer, okay?

03:22.703 --> 03:25.406
- Good, you can help me
self-investigate.

03:25.439 --> 03:28.809
- All right, first, I need you
to put that gun down.

03:28.842 --> 03:30.344
- Maybe.

03:30.378 --> 03:33.314
H-how do I know you ain't in it?

03:33.347 --> 03:34.582
Hey!
[gunshot]

03:34.615 --> 03:36.317
[people screaming]

03:36.350 --> 03:37.818
We're not done here!
- Oh, yes, we are.

03:37.851 --> 03:39.553
- He's a police officer too.

03:39.587 --> 03:41.555
Get on your knees!
Hand me that gun slowly.

03:41.589 --> 03:43.324
On your knees.

03:43.357 --> 03:46.327
[tense music]

03:46.360 --> 03:50.331
*

03:50.364 --> 03:53.334
[dramatic music]

03:53.367 --> 04:00.374
*

04:36.577 --> 04:36.877
.

04:36.910 --> 04:37.945
- This is out of control.
Who's gonna come eat here now?

04:40.348 --> 04:41.849
- Well, we'll get the precinct
to provide security,

04:41.882 --> 04:43.016
but hopefully this is
a one-time event.

04:43.050 --> 04:44.385
- Why are you talking to him?

04:44.418 --> 04:45.553
Why aren't you doing your job?

04:45.586 --> 04:47.355
- Why don't you shut up?

04:47.388 --> 04:49.022
- Tell him to show you
the basement.

04:49.056 --> 04:50.991
- Okay, Mr. Lee, is that
where you keep

04:51.024 --> 04:52.793
your teenage sex slaves?
In the basement?

04:52.826 --> 04:54.528
- No, this is crazy!

04:54.562 --> 04:56.397
- I saw the building plan
online.

04:56.430 --> 04:58.832
Just look through that door.

04:58.866 --> 05:00.834
- Wait, he wants
to see that door?

05:00.868 --> 05:02.403
- Well, Mr. Lee, if you
don't wanna show him

05:02.436 --> 05:03.937
what's behind that door,
you don't have to.

05:03.971 --> 05:06.440
- He wants to see?
[mop rattles]

05:08.476 --> 05:12.079
- So what's this?
This is your teenage sex slave?

05:12.112 --> 05:14.047
- Just check--
check the back wall.

05:14.081 --> 05:15.516
It opens.

05:15.549 --> 05:18.486
[hand smacking solidly]

05:18.519 --> 05:20.788
- Sounds pretty solid.
Get him out of here.

05:22.923 --> 05:24.492
- This restaurant
has no basement.

05:24.525 --> 05:26.394
- Unusual for New York.

05:26.427 --> 05:28.462
- Yeah, but it kind of rules out
the sex slave dungeon.

05:28.496 --> 05:29.997
- This restaurant--
the Internet is not

05:30.030 --> 05:32.032
letting this go.

05:32.065 --> 05:34.768
It claims that the Coral Dragon
has this deep, hidden basement

05:34.802 --> 05:36.537
that you guys just didn't
look hard enough to find.

05:36.570 --> 05:38.506
- There's no basement.
Who believes this stuff?

05:38.539 --> 05:41.074
- Nowadays, people are gonna
believe what they wanna believe.

05:41.108 --> 05:42.976
- But there is
such a thing as reality,

05:43.010 --> 05:44.912
so who's putting out this stuff
about the Coral Dragon?

05:44.945 --> 05:46.914
- Well, it's this website,
TheEndlessTruth.com.

05:46.947 --> 05:49.016
And your guy with the rifle,

05:49.049 --> 05:50.384
Malcolm Barnstable,

05:50.418 --> 05:51.952
he'd been posting comments.

05:51.985 --> 05:53.387
- "Thank you for
exposing this evil.

05:53.421 --> 05:54.888
These people
have to be stopped."

05:54.922 --> 05:56.957
- TheEndlessTruth.com
has to be stopped.

05:56.990 --> 05:58.926
- Well, if idiots with guns
are taking their lead

05:58.959 --> 06:00.428
from them, yeah.

06:00.461 --> 06:03.063
You two, pay him a visit.

06:03.096 --> 06:04.932
[dramatic sting]

06:04.965 --> 06:07.801
- This is the headquarters
for "The Endless Truth"?

06:07.835 --> 06:09.102
- It's all it takes.

06:09.136 --> 06:10.971
That computer connects me
to the world.

06:11.004 --> 06:12.506
- And who are you?

06:12.540 --> 06:15.075
- Ron Duca.
It's my news service.

06:15.108 --> 06:16.577
- You don't have
any other employees?

06:16.610 --> 06:18.412
- Oh, no need.

06:18.446 --> 06:19.947
With the Internet,
one person's voice can be

06:19.980 --> 06:21.582
as big as any organ
of the mainstream media.

06:21.615 --> 06:24.084
- Except the mainstream media
doesn't spread lies

06:24.117 --> 06:25.953
about a sex ring
that doesn't exist.

06:25.986 --> 06:28.088
- They're not lies.

06:28.121 --> 06:30.458
You know Congressman Bolton's
email account was hacked, right?

06:30.491 --> 06:31.959
- And whose hasn't been?

06:31.992 --> 06:33.427
- Bolton's emails
were a revelation.

06:33.461 --> 06:35.095
I had a moral duty
to publish them.

06:35.128 --> 06:37.931
- Yeah, he got a few free rounds
of golf from a lobbyist.

06:37.965 --> 06:39.833
- That was nothing.

06:39.867 --> 06:41.869
Some of my readers took
a closer look at his emails,

06:41.902 --> 06:45.939
starting with this.

06:45.973 --> 06:48.676
- "Meet you at the Coral Dragon,
as usual, 4:00 p.m.

06:48.709 --> 06:51.078
"They've got a new dish
on the menu:

06:51.111 --> 06:53.881
fresh Chinese broccoli,
highly recommended."

06:55.583 --> 06:57.585
Okay.

06:57.618 --> 07:00.488
- Okay, this isn't
about Chinese food.

07:00.521 --> 07:02.923
I mean, who eats dinner
at 4:00 p.m.?

07:02.956 --> 07:05.225
And Chinese broccoli?
Initials, CB.

07:05.258 --> 07:08.128
On pedophile message boards,
CB stands for "child brides."

07:08.161 --> 07:10.931
- It can also stand
for "Chinese broccoli."

07:10.964 --> 07:12.700
- Sure.

07:12.733 --> 07:17.237
Look at these photos,
taken outside the restaurant.

07:17.270 --> 07:19.973
Where are those girls going?
- Home, with their fathers.

07:20.007 --> 07:21.475
- Where are their mothers?

07:21.509 --> 07:23.544
And look at this.

07:23.577 --> 07:25.513
[tense music]

07:25.546 --> 07:27.014
- Coral Dragon.

07:27.047 --> 07:28.716
- Well, look
at the dragon's tail...

07:28.749 --> 07:30.618
heart-shaped.

07:30.651 --> 07:32.486
- Oh, man.

07:32.520 --> 07:34.021
- I'm sure you're
familiar with this

07:34.054 --> 07:35.656
from your law
enforcement research.

07:35.689 --> 07:39.159
Butterfly with
heart-shaped wings,

07:39.192 --> 07:41.962
a symbol for "child lover"
on the dark web.

07:41.995 --> 07:43.631
That restaurant is advertising
what goes on there

07:43.664 --> 07:45.265
for those in the know.

07:45.298 --> 07:48.235
- Yeah, speaking of advertising,
how much do you make

07:48.268 --> 07:50.504
when the nut jobs that
believe all this stuff

07:50.538 --> 07:52.940
go to your website
and click on the ads?

07:52.973 --> 07:54.141
- I'm entitled to make a living.

07:54.174 --> 07:55.275
I'm providing a public service.

07:55.308 --> 07:57.277
- Public service?

07:57.310 --> 07:59.547
One of your wacko fans walked
into that restaurant with a gun.

07:59.580 --> 08:01.081
He could've killed somebody.

08:01.114 --> 08:03.183
- If you really wanna do
a public service,

08:03.216 --> 08:06.019
you could switch your focus to,
say, UFOs, maybe Bigfoot?

08:06.053 --> 08:08.188
Okay, this is dangerous.
- This is free speech.

08:08.221 --> 08:10.223
You can't make me stop.
And, instead of harassing me,

08:10.257 --> 08:12.125
you should be investigating
the Coral Dragon.

08:12.159 --> 08:14.094
- We already did.
There's nothing there.

08:14.127 --> 08:16.664
- Nothing?
[chuckling]

08:16.697 --> 08:20.100
Really?
Have you seen this list?

08:20.133 --> 08:24.237
"Varsity Restaurant Supplies.
Owner: Ronald Fleming."

08:24.271 --> 08:27.074
Arrested by the NYPD,
you guys,

08:27.107 --> 08:28.609
and convicted
of sex with a child.

08:28.642 --> 08:30.077
Do you think that's
a coincidence?

08:30.110 --> 08:31.278
- Well, if we show
that it is, will you let

08:31.311 --> 08:34.281
this whole fairy tale go?

08:34.314 --> 08:36.516
- I'm a reasonable man.
- Great.

08:38.251 --> 08:40.087
[door clicks]

08:40.120 --> 08:42.590
- Coral Dragon?

08:42.623 --> 08:44.792
I sold 'em dishes and cutlery,
but I lost the account

08:44.825 --> 08:46.560
more than ten years ago.

08:46.594 --> 08:48.562
They went with the owner's
cousin in Queens.

08:48.596 --> 08:52.566
The Chinese
like to stick together.

08:52.600 --> 08:54.568
You here because of that crap
on the Internet?

08:54.602 --> 08:56.169
- We're trying to shut 'em down.

08:56.203 --> 08:58.806
- And you're part of their
so-called evidence

08:58.839 --> 09:01.609
because of your conviction.

09:01.642 --> 09:04.578
- Statutory rape, 30 years ago.

09:04.612 --> 09:06.680
I was 25; she was 15.

09:06.714 --> 09:08.248
- That's a sex crime.

09:08.281 --> 09:09.983
- Yeah, the judge
kind of made that point

09:10.017 --> 09:12.052
when he sent me upstate
for four years.

09:12.085 --> 09:15.589
But that was another lifetime.

09:15.623 --> 09:18.125
I'm married now.
I have children.

09:18.158 --> 09:21.128
- So you and Congressman Bolton
don't hang out with sex slaves

09:21.161 --> 09:23.230
at the Coral Dragon?

09:23.263 --> 09:25.232
- I've never met a congressman.

09:25.265 --> 09:26.734
I haven't stepped foot
in that restaurant

09:26.767 --> 09:29.202
since I lost the account.

09:29.236 --> 09:31.304
And I'm allergic to MSG.

09:33.874 --> 09:36.076
- The man who fired the shot
here yesterday,

09:36.109 --> 09:38.278
Malcolm Barnstable,
has been charged with

09:38.311 --> 09:40.648
criminal possession
of a weapon,

09:40.681 --> 09:43.283
criminal mischief,
and menacing.

09:43.316 --> 09:47.220
The NYPD has investigated
this alleged illegal activity

09:47.254 --> 09:49.757
that brought him here,
and we have concluded that

09:49.790 --> 09:53.727
there's absolutely no basis
to these allegations.

09:53.761 --> 09:56.029
The Chinese restaurant
is that indeed.

09:56.063 --> 09:58.632
It is a Chinese
restaurant, period.

09:58.666 --> 10:01.134
And we appeal to the public
not to believe--

10:01.168 --> 10:03.871
- Thank you, Lieutenant,
all of you.

10:03.904 --> 10:05.773
Will that website
cut it out now?

10:05.806 --> 10:07.741
- I'm not sure Duca believes
one word he's saying.

10:07.775 --> 10:09.309
He's--he's making a bundle
attracting readers

10:09.342 --> 10:10.678
who click on the ads.

10:10.711 --> 10:13.246
- Yeah, there oughta be a law.

10:13.280 --> 10:15.048
- Easier said than done.

10:15.082 --> 10:16.750
I hope that suffices.

10:16.784 --> 10:19.653
Thank you, again.
- You're welcome. Good luck.

10:19.687 --> 10:21.889
- What now?
We go back to actual sex crimes?

10:21.922 --> 10:23.857
- That's a thought.

10:23.891 --> 10:25.759
- There's no shortage of those.

10:25.793 --> 10:28.161
I'm on "The Endless Truth"
website, and one of those

10:28.195 --> 10:32.065
Endless Truthers
searching for clues found

10:32.099 --> 10:35.869
a real sex trafficking site
on the dark web.

10:35.903 --> 10:39.807
- Okay, get this to NCMEC
and Computer Crimes.

10:39.840 --> 10:41.909
See if we can trace it.

10:41.942 --> 10:44.912
[foreboding music]

10:44.945 --> 10:47.247
*

10:47.280 --> 10:49.149
- These are the innocent images.

10:49.182 --> 10:52.452
There are also semi-nudes
showing off the merchandise.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.254
- Where are these from?

10:54.287 --> 10:56.223
- Could be across the street.
Could be Romania.

10:56.256 --> 10:57.825
- The come-on lines
are in English.

10:57.858 --> 10:59.426
- Universal language
of pedophiles,

10:59.459 --> 11:01.261
like air traffic controllers.

11:01.294 --> 11:03.430
- That's a U.S. phone number.

11:03.463 --> 11:06.233
- Burner cell--they don't
pick up unless they recognize

11:06.266 --> 11:08.368
the caller ID.
You have to be a known customer.

11:08.401 --> 11:10.103
- Okay, what if we
work backwards?

11:10.137 --> 11:11.739
We go from the pimp
to the customers?

11:11.772 --> 11:13.406
- It's not hard for johns
to anonymize themselves.

11:13.440 --> 11:15.208
They'd be pretty dumb not to.

11:15.242 --> 11:19.246
- They can't all be geniuses.
Can we at least try?

11:19.279 --> 11:21.114
- All right.

11:21.148 --> 11:22.816
*

11:22.850 --> 11:24.317
[keyboard clicks]

11:24.351 --> 11:26.353
[electronic beeping]

11:26.386 --> 11:30.891
Most of the messages to the
johns disappear into the ether.

11:30.924 --> 11:34.194
But we've got one with
an identifiable IP address.

11:34.227 --> 11:35.763
- Do you have
a physical address?

11:35.796 --> 11:38.799
A name?

11:38.832 --> 11:42.836
- West 88th Street.
The name is Bolton.

11:42.870 --> 11:44.504
- Congressman Luke Bolton?

11:44.537 --> 11:46.807
- That's the guy.

11:57.017 --> 11:57.184
.

11:57.217 --> 11:57.985
- I've never seen this
before in my life.

12:00.253 --> 12:02.055
- We're gonna need
to take your computer

12:02.089 --> 12:03.891
and examine it.
- For God's sake, I've got

12:03.924 --> 12:05.926
a teenage daughter.
- We just need to be sure.

12:05.959 --> 12:07.360
- When my email was hacked,
I thought it was

12:07.394 --> 12:09.897
routine harassment,
business as usual these days,

12:09.930 --> 12:12.232
but this--
they can plant things remotely

12:12.265 --> 12:14.034
on people's computers,
can't they?

12:14.067 --> 12:16.303
- But who would wanna do that
on your computer?

12:16.336 --> 12:18.171
- I'm on the House
Foreign Affairs Committee

12:18.205 --> 12:19.372
where I play an active role.

12:19.406 --> 12:21.341
- We read the papers.

12:21.374 --> 12:23.310
- Well, then you might know
that I--I'm a strong supporter

12:23.343 --> 12:25.312
of aid to Kosovo,
which pisses off Serbia.

12:25.345 --> 12:29.349
- So, what, this was planted
by the Serbian secret police?

12:29.382 --> 12:32.920
- Or the Turks.
I support arming the Kurds.

12:32.953 --> 12:35.823
Or China.
I promote arm sales to Taiwan.

12:35.856 --> 12:38.325
Or Russia because
of my stance on Ukraine.

12:38.358 --> 12:40.794
- You have any
friends overseas?

12:40.828 --> 12:44.131
- Canada loves me.
My mother's from Winnipeg.

12:44.164 --> 12:47.067
- Okay, and we're gonna take
all of that into consideration,

12:47.100 --> 12:50.337
but we need to start
by taking your computer.

12:50.370 --> 12:52.205
- Do you really think
I'd be stupid enough to ask you

12:52.239 --> 12:53.974
to open an investigation
that would lead

12:54.007 --> 12:55.208
straight back to me?

12:55.242 --> 12:57.377
- Probably not.

12:59.847 --> 13:02.182
- Okay, that was
Computer Crimes.

13:02.215 --> 13:04.351
Bolton's hard drive
was full of child pornography

13:04.384 --> 13:06.820
and messages
about teenage hookers.

13:06.854 --> 13:09.256
- Either this guy's a perv,
or he's being framed

13:09.289 --> 13:11.024
by some foreign spy group.

13:11.058 --> 13:12.960
- Bolton gave us his schedule.

13:12.993 --> 13:15.095
He was in Washington every time
one of those messages

13:15.128 --> 13:17.230
was supposedly sent
from his computer in New York.

13:17.264 --> 13:20.467
- And it is quite a coincidence
that his computer address

13:20.500 --> 13:23.036
is the only one
that wasn't shielded.

13:23.070 --> 13:25.438
- Okay, so the stuff
on his computer was planted.

13:25.472 --> 13:29.009
- These pictures are real.
These girls are real.

13:30.510 --> 13:33.013
- Yeah, none of them are older
than 15, and they definitely

13:33.046 --> 13:34.915
did not volunteer for this.

13:34.948 --> 13:37.217
- Somebody's running them
and selling them.

13:37.250 --> 13:39.386
And Computer Crimes
found messages from predators.

13:39.419 --> 13:41.254
They're ordering them
for delivery.

13:41.288 --> 13:43.323
- We find these girls.
We rescue these girls.

13:43.356 --> 13:45.025
That's our priority.

13:45.058 --> 13:46.860
- They can't trace
where the messages

13:46.894 --> 13:48.461
or the pictures come from.
- Right, but whoever

13:48.495 --> 13:51.131
is framing Bolton did find them.

13:51.164 --> 13:55.302
They needed a real child sex
ring to make their frame stick,

13:55.335 --> 13:57.337
so they found one.

13:57.370 --> 14:00.908
- But if a spy outfit went to
all this trouble just to smear

14:00.941 --> 14:03.443
a congressman,
then maybe if we find out

14:03.476 --> 14:05.345
who they are, they can
lead us to these girls.

14:05.378 --> 14:07.447
- And who do we call
to find these spies?

14:07.480 --> 14:10.117
James Bond?
- No.

14:10.150 --> 14:12.252
Someone a little less dashing.

14:12.285 --> 14:15.155
Duca.
Find out who sent him

14:15.188 --> 14:17.190
the hacked emails.

14:17.224 --> 14:19.392
- You should be going after
Bolton and that restaurant.

14:19.426 --> 14:22.162
- And we'll get right to that,
but first, we need to know

14:22.195 --> 14:24.197
who sent you Bolton's
hacked emails.

14:24.231 --> 14:26.066
- Why?
- Because it could lead us

14:26.099 --> 14:27.901
to an actual
child prostitution ring.

14:27.935 --> 14:29.436
- That's what I've been
trying to tell you.

14:29.469 --> 14:32.205
- No, an actual, actual
child prostitution ring.

14:32.239 --> 14:35.943
- Forget it.
Anyways, I don't know.

14:35.976 --> 14:37.544
Those emails came to me
anonymously.

14:37.577 --> 14:39.446
- You sure?
No return address?

14:39.479 --> 14:41.281
Not a hint?

14:41.314 --> 14:42.916
- No.
- All right, then you won't mind

14:42.950 --> 14:44.284
us taking a look
at your computer, right?

14:44.317 --> 14:47.187
- No, I would mind.
Absolutely not.

14:47.220 --> 14:48.521
- That's what we thought.

14:48.555 --> 14:50.423
That's why we brought
a subpoena.

14:53.093 --> 14:55.295
[dramatic sting]

14:55.328 --> 14:57.530
- So not only is Duca
fighting the subpoena;

14:57.564 --> 14:59.232
he's representing himself.

14:59.266 --> 15:00.968
- Well, as they say,
anybody that represents

15:01.001 --> 15:02.502
themselves has a fool
for a client.

15:02.535 --> 15:04.938
- Yeah, well, unfortunately,
he's more dangerous than that.

15:04.972 --> 15:07.540
- I have here a motion
to quash the State's subpoena

15:07.574 --> 15:10.243
against Mr. Duca.
- Yes, Your Honor.

15:10.277 --> 15:12.112
- And you're represented by?

15:12.145 --> 15:13.213
- By me.

15:13.246 --> 15:15.248
- I see.
Ms. Callier?

15:15.282 --> 15:17.217
- The state opposes the motion.

15:17.250 --> 15:20.220
Accessing Mr. Duca's computer
is the only way to gain

15:20.253 --> 15:22.555
crucial information
about two on-going

15:22.589 --> 15:25.192
criminal investigations:
the hacking of

15:25.225 --> 15:29.129
a U.S. Congressman and an
underage sex trafficking ring.

15:29.162 --> 15:31.231
- That's all well and good, but
the information on my hard drive

15:31.264 --> 15:33.166
has not been published
and is privileged.

15:33.200 --> 15:35.235
- How so, Mr. Duca?

15:35.268 --> 15:38.138
- I need to protect my sources,
or I can't continue

15:38.171 --> 15:40.507
to conduct important
political investigations.

15:40.540 --> 15:43.376
- Mr. Duca is hardly
a journalist.

15:43.410 --> 15:46.546
He's the author of a website
disseminating fake news

15:46.579 --> 15:49.316
and salacious
conspiracy theories.

15:49.349 --> 15:51.384
- I report on the truth.

15:51.418 --> 15:53.586
I'm a watchdog for the people.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.388
I protect regular citizens

15:55.422 --> 15:58.225
from government malfeasance
and abuse.

15:58.258 --> 16:01.028
- Let's imagine for a moment
he's a legitimate reporter.

16:01.061 --> 16:05.132
The State is still entitled to
the information on his computer.

16:05.165 --> 16:08.268
In the United States versus
Sterling, the court held,

16:08.301 --> 16:11.404
"So long as a subpoena
is issued in good faith

16:11.438 --> 16:14.407
"based on the legitimate need
of law enforcement,

16:14.441 --> 16:18.045
"the government need not make
any special showing to obtain

16:18.078 --> 16:20.513
"evidence, criminal conduct
from a reporter

16:20.547 --> 16:22.482
in a criminal proceeding."

16:22.515 --> 16:28.488
Bottom line is, young girls
are being exploited as we speak,

16:28.521 --> 16:32.625
and the data on Mr. Duca's
computer can help us find them.

16:32.659 --> 16:35.162
- I agree.
The subpoena stands.

16:35.195 --> 16:36.496
[gavel bangs]

16:41.468 --> 16:43.536
- Duca didn't look happy.
- Good.

16:43.570 --> 16:46.039
Look, we need to get his
hard drive to Computer Crimes

16:46.073 --> 16:47.540
as soon as possible.
- On my way to Evidence Control

16:47.574 --> 16:49.176
right now.

16:49.209 --> 16:50.610
- This isn't over.
You're attacking

16:50.643 --> 16:52.245
the wrong journalist.

16:52.279 --> 16:53.613
- Okay, watch yourself,
Mr. Duca,

16:53.646 --> 16:56.349
or gonna be back in court
as a defendant.

16:56.383 --> 16:57.617
- Is that a threat?

16:57.650 --> 16:59.219
- Yeah.
- Well, as long as I know

16:59.252 --> 17:01.288
the rules of engagement.

17:01.321 --> 17:03.156
- Go home, Mr. Duca.
- Oh, I will.

17:03.190 --> 17:05.258
You have my hard drive,
but not my brain,

17:05.292 --> 17:07.627
not my website.
- So?

17:07.660 --> 17:09.296
- "The Endless Truth"
has two million

17:09.329 --> 17:10.697
unique visitors a day,

17:10.730 --> 17:14.467
and they all believe
whatever I tell them to.

17:17.370 --> 17:19.306
- Do you think he even
believes his own hype?

17:19.339 --> 17:21.441
That's he's a
"watchdog for the people"?

17:21.474 --> 17:23.576
- I actually don't think that
he believes anything at all.

17:23.610 --> 17:26.346
- [groans]

17:27.480 --> 17:29.082
- Anything?
- Computer Crimes

17:29.116 --> 17:30.583
has opened Duca's hard drive.

17:30.617 --> 17:32.352
They're working on it,
and they will let us know

17:32.385 --> 17:34.154
when they find something.

17:34.187 --> 17:35.488
- And did they say how long
it might take?

17:35.522 --> 17:37.190
- Could be hours,
could be days.

17:37.224 --> 17:38.691
- So what now?
- We do what the man says

17:38.725 --> 17:41.228
and track this ring down
another way,

17:41.261 --> 17:43.663
the way that we usually do it.

17:43.696 --> 17:46.633
So let's run the photos
through facial recognition.

17:46.666 --> 17:48.701
Cross reference them
with missing persons.

17:48.735 --> 17:51.538
Follow up with NCMEC.
Let's cultivate sources

17:51.571 --> 17:54.474
and see if we can flip anyone
who might be involved

17:54.507 --> 17:57.544
or knows someone
that knows something.

17:59.746 --> 18:02.382
- Hey, Lieutenant?
- Yeah?

18:02.415 --> 18:05.418
- "The Endless Truth" just
posted some new accusations.

18:05.452 --> 18:07.220
- Against who?

18:07.254 --> 18:09.289
- You and Rollins.

18:09.322 --> 18:11.291
You need to see this.

18:13.360 --> 18:16.329
[dramatic music]

18:16.363 --> 18:17.764
*

18:17.797 --> 18:19.566
- Those pictures
are from yesterday.

18:19.599 --> 18:21.668
- You notice somebody
following you?

18:21.701 --> 18:23.670
- I wasn't looking.

18:23.703 --> 18:25.705
- "How to explain SVU cover-up
of Coral Dragon sex ring:

18:25.738 --> 18:30.277
"Detective Benson and Rollins
both have fatherless babies

18:30.310 --> 18:33.580
"of unknown origin.
Human flesh payoffs

18:33.613 --> 18:35.415
"from sex ring
to look the other way?

18:35.448 --> 18:37.417
What do you think?"

18:37.450 --> 18:40.220
- I think this guy needs his
computer shoved down his throat.

18:46.926 --> 18:47.294
.

18:47.327 --> 18:48.495
- Okay, and you spoke with your
mother, and she's expecting you?

18:50.830 --> 18:52.665
- Yes, yes, it's all set.
- It's all right with her?

18:52.699 --> 18:54.667
- It's fine.
- Okay, so the squad car

18:54.701 --> 18:56.569
will escort you up there,
and then, when you get there,

18:56.603 --> 18:58.271
the township police will
keep an eye on the house, okay?

18:58.305 --> 18:59.806
- Okay.
- And I'll be out tonight

18:59.839 --> 19:01.874
as soon as I can.
Okay, you're just gonna

19:01.908 --> 19:05.345
go for a little ride with Lucy,
and I'm gonna see you tonight.

19:05.378 --> 19:07.680
- And you've got enough bananas,
Cheerios, diapers?

19:07.714 --> 19:09.816
- They have grocery stores
in New Jersey.

19:09.849 --> 19:12.352
- Okay, see you later.
Look, it's probably nothing,

19:12.385 --> 19:13.786
all right?
We just--we just

19:13.820 --> 19:15.288
wanna be careful.
- I understand.

19:15.322 --> 19:16.823
They'll be fine.
You come when you can.

19:16.856 --> 19:18.558
- I will.
- Bye.

19:18.591 --> 19:20.327
- Love you.
- Bye, baby. See you soon.

19:20.360 --> 19:22.695
- Buh-bye.
- All right, sweetheart,

19:22.729 --> 19:24.297
love you, okay?
- Bye.

19:24.331 --> 19:25.598
- Bye, honey.

19:25.632 --> 19:27.834
[engine turns over]

19:27.867 --> 19:30.237
Bye-bye. Drive safe.

19:30.270 --> 19:31.971
Bye, babe.

19:38.345 --> 19:40.413
- You got 'em away?

19:40.447 --> 19:42.382
- Yeah.
- Good.

19:42.415 --> 19:44.384
"The Endless Truth" is still
pushing that garbage story.

19:44.417 --> 19:45.852
Now some of its readers
are posting threats

19:45.885 --> 19:47.254
against you and Rollins.

19:47.287 --> 19:48.988
- What about Jesse and Noah?

19:49.021 --> 19:51.691
- Some of the self-investigators
like that guy Malcolm,

19:51.724 --> 19:53.693
they're interested in them.

19:53.726 --> 19:55.728
- "Someone should take
those kids from

19:55.762 --> 19:58.865
"their so-called mothers
and test their DNA.

19:58.898 --> 20:01.801
Crack the sex ring.
Let the truth ring out."

20:01.834 --> 20:04.871
- Arrest the son of a bitch
who runs that thing.

20:04.904 --> 20:06.339
- For what?

20:06.373 --> 20:07.807
- Breathing.

20:11.878 --> 20:14.281
- Those photos you took?
That's felony stalking.

20:14.314 --> 20:16.015
- I didn't take them.
My readers sent them in.

20:16.048 --> 20:18.885
- Yeah, readers encouraged by
you to investigate the situation

20:18.918 --> 20:20.920
by taking their kids.
Pal, that's enough

20:20.953 --> 20:22.789
to make an attempted
kidnapping case.

20:22.822 --> 20:24.991
- I didn't stalk anyone.
I didn't kidnap anyone.

20:25.024 --> 20:27.360
I just raised a legitimate
question about this unit's

20:27.394 --> 20:31.731
odd failure to investigate
a ring that enslaves children.

20:33.966 --> 20:37.304
- Do you even believe anything
you're saying right now, huh?

20:37.337 --> 20:39.672
Or is this all about getting
money for clicks on ads?

20:39.706 --> 20:41.341
- You clearly have
no interest in getting

20:41.374 --> 20:43.310
to the bottom of this.
If you did, you'd have

20:43.343 --> 20:45.445
an independent laboratory
test those children's DNA

20:45.478 --> 20:47.380
and tell us
where they came from.

20:47.414 --> 20:49.649
- Because of your insane
fantasies about

20:49.682 --> 20:51.784
"human flesh payoffs"?

20:51.818 --> 20:53.320
- Think she's gonna rip
his head off?

20:53.353 --> 20:55.054
- If she doesn't I will.
- What fantasy?

20:55.087 --> 20:57.457
Now you admit there's
a sex ring exploiting children.

20:57.490 --> 20:59.959
You've seen my evidence
about that restaurant.

20:59.992 --> 21:02.329
Your people even supposedly
talked to that child rapist,

21:02.362 --> 21:04.297
Ronald Fleming, but instead
of investigating that,

21:04.331 --> 21:05.932
you're making empty
threats against me.

21:05.965 --> 21:07.800
- Oh, believe me...
- Stalking, kidnapping?

21:07.834 --> 21:09.302
- You can trust me right now.

21:09.336 --> 21:11.404
Those threats?
Not empty.

21:11.438 --> 21:13.340
- Listen to me.
Listen to me.

21:13.373 --> 21:16.776
If you really want to help
children who are victimized,

21:16.809 --> 21:18.945
then tell us who sent you
those hacked emails.

21:18.978 --> 21:22.048
- I told you,
I don't know.

21:24.984 --> 21:29.389
But I do know that young sex
slaves sometimes get pregnant

21:29.422 --> 21:32.525
and have babies
their bosses don't want,

21:32.559 --> 21:35.462
and you are a single woman
without a child

21:35.495 --> 21:38.698
who suddenly, out of nowhere,
gets a mystery baby.

21:38.731 --> 21:41.434
- Oh, that baby
is not a mystery.

21:41.468 --> 21:44.371
That baby is my son.

21:44.404 --> 21:45.805
- Yeah, where'd he come from?

21:45.838 --> 21:49.509
- Lieutenant?
- Not now, Fin.

21:49.542 --> 21:52.011
- It's important.
- It can wait.

21:52.044 --> 21:54.046
- Liv, please.

[tense music]

21:57.484 --> 22:04.557
*

22:06.393 --> 22:07.960
- Why are you pulling me out?

22:07.994 --> 22:09.829
I was just getting started
with that guy.

22:09.862 --> 22:12.098
- Just listen.
- Computer Crimes found

22:12.131 --> 22:14.801
something on the son of
a bitch's hard drive.

22:14.834 --> 22:17.136
- Someone's been sending info
to "The Endless Truth."

22:17.169 --> 22:19.572
- Like the hacked emails
from Congressman Bolton.

22:19.606 --> 22:21.140
- That's great.
- Yeah, so it could be

22:21.173 --> 22:23.476
the same hacker that
planted the child porn

22:23.510 --> 22:26.012
on Bolton's hard drive.
- You have an IP address?

22:26.045 --> 22:27.380
- Even better,
he just got picked up.

22:27.414 --> 22:29.048
He's being held at 1PP.

22:29.081 --> 22:30.917
- You're kidding me.
They already have him

22:30.950 --> 22:32.151
in custody?
- Computer Crimes have been

22:32.184 --> 22:33.853
tracking this kid for months.

22:33.886 --> 22:35.021
He's--he's a pretty
active hacker.

22:35.054 --> 22:36.789
- Let's go talk to him.

22:40.059 --> 22:41.894
Start talking, Raj,
or you're gonna be spending

22:41.928 --> 22:44.431
the next ten years
of your life behind bars.

22:44.464 --> 22:46.933
- Disseminating child
pornography is a serious charge.

22:46.966 --> 22:49.402
It's a federal offense,
so there's no way around it.

22:49.436 --> 22:51.904
- So if you have any hopes
of getting out of here

22:51.938 --> 22:54.040
while you're still in your 20s,
you need to come clean.

22:54.073 --> 22:56.108
- I'm not a pervert.
I swear.

22:56.142 --> 22:58.478
I didn't look at any
of those pictures, not one.

22:58.511 --> 23:00.580
- But you did plant them
on Congressman Bolton's

23:00.613 --> 23:02.782
computer, right?
- Yeah.

23:02.815 --> 23:04.617
- For fun?
You have something

23:04.651 --> 23:06.152
against the Congressman?

23:06.185 --> 23:07.920
- It was a job.
I was getting paid.

23:07.954 --> 23:09.822
- By who?
- I don't know.

23:09.856 --> 23:11.924
They found me.
On the dark net.

23:11.958 --> 23:13.926
It's untraceable.
- So what did they want?

23:13.960 --> 23:16.162
- Hack Bolton's emails,
then send them to this website,

23:16.195 --> 23:19.031
"The Endless Truth."
The "Endless Truth" guy, Duca,

23:19.065 --> 23:21.200
he's the one who started the
whole Chinese restaurant hoax.

23:21.233 --> 23:23.069
- And what about
the kiddie porn?

23:23.102 --> 23:24.904
- The restaurant hoax
wasn't enough.

23:24.937 --> 23:26.205
They wanted me
to connect Bolton

23:26.238 --> 23:28.074
to an actual
kiddie trafficking ring.

23:28.107 --> 23:30.076
- And how did you do that?
Where did you find the website?

23:30.109 --> 23:32.445
The actual website
with the underage girls?

23:32.479 --> 23:35.081
- On "The Endless Truth."
- What do you mean?

23:35.114 --> 23:37.116
- There were lots of posts
about this guy who used to do

23:37.149 --> 23:40.052
some work for the restaurant,
so I hacked his computer too

23:40.086 --> 23:43.089
and found a link
to a sex trafficking website.

23:43.122 --> 23:47.126
This guy, he's the real
pervert, not me.

23:52.699 --> 23:55.668
- I told you I haven't been to
the Coral Dragon in ten years.

23:55.702 --> 23:57.470
- Well, this isn't about
the restaurant anymore.

23:57.504 --> 23:58.971
- Then why are you here?

23:59.005 --> 24:00.473
I served my time.
This was all decades ago.

24:00.507 --> 24:02.074
- Then you have nothing
to worry about.

24:02.108 --> 24:03.142
- Is that your computer?

24:12.519 --> 24:12.685
.

24:12.719 --> 24:13.586
- This is your computer,
your browsing history.

24:15.722 --> 24:17.524
This is what we find.
- And other pictures

24:17.557 --> 24:19.225
with girls unclothed.
- I was only looking.

24:19.258 --> 24:21.728
- Oh, that's a confession.
Illegal child pornography.

24:21.761 --> 24:24.196
- Plus, you were doing
more than looking.

24:24.230 --> 24:28.267
- We found messages to the pimp,
ordering up girls.

24:28.300 --> 24:30.503
Twice in the last month.

24:30.537 --> 24:34.073
- Well, it looks like your sins
aren't all in the past, hmm?

24:34.106 --> 24:38.678
- I, um...I can't help myself.

24:38.711 --> 24:40.547
- Sure, you can.
You're just not

24:40.580 --> 24:42.214
trying hard enough.

24:42.248 --> 24:43.816
- My wife--
this will destroy her.

24:43.850 --> 24:45.818
- It's a little late
to think about that.

24:45.852 --> 24:48.788
- I can't go back to jail.
My business, my children...

24:48.821 --> 24:51.223
- Well, we can put
a good word in for you

24:51.257 --> 24:52.692
to the District Attorney,

24:52.725 --> 24:55.862
but you'd have to do
something for us.

25:05.337 --> 25:06.873
[horn honking]

25:09.776 --> 25:11.644
- Do we have an ETA?

25:11.678 --> 25:13.245
- He made the call for the girl
about an hour ago,

25:13.279 --> 25:15.181
so they should be getting here
any time.

25:15.214 --> 25:17.149
- What kind of car are they in?

25:17.183 --> 25:19.118
- Fleming said a black one.

25:19.151 --> 25:20.787
- That's a big help.

25:20.820 --> 25:22.689
- Guess he wasn't
checking out the car.

25:28.828 --> 25:31.130
- It's all good.
Unis checked the place.

25:31.163 --> 25:33.165
It's clean.
Fleming's sitting here

25:33.199 --> 25:35.635
calming himself
with some cheap scotch.

25:35.668 --> 25:37.837
- Is that a good idea?

25:37.870 --> 25:39.872
- Well, it stopped him
from crying.

25:39.906 --> 25:41.741
- Why do you even need me here?

25:41.774 --> 25:43.643
- Shut up.

25:43.676 --> 25:45.612
- Where does he take the girls
when they get there?

25:45.645 --> 25:47.747
- He's got a couch
in a room in the back.

25:47.780 --> 25:50.617
I mean, this guy
is first class all the way.

25:51.684 --> 25:54.887
- Filthy couch in the back room
of a pots and pans store.

25:54.921 --> 25:56.589
- Yep.

25:56.623 --> 25:58.290
- Prison's gonna be
a step up for this guy.

25:58.324 --> 26:01.260
- Mm-hmm, I'm not sure
he's gonna see it that way.

- No, not till she's inside,
and he offers money for sex.

Hands on the roof!

You're safe now.
It's okay. It's okay.

27:51.437 --> 27:53.372

for sex trafficking.

27:53.405 --> 27:55.007
- Sex trafficking?
- Yeah, now where are

27:55.041 --> 27:57.009
the other girls?
- What girls?

I'm a car service driver.
This is just a fare.

I don't know what she was up to.

28:13.960 --> 28:16.395

was getting pimped out,

28:16.428 --> 28:17.830
and she's underage.

28:17.864 --> 28:19.331
You're looking at 20 years.

28:19.365 --> 28:20.900
- I don't know anything
about that.

28:20.933 --> 28:23.002
I was just giving

- Okay, Marian.

28:40.352 --> 28:43.355
So what were you doing tonight?

28:43.389 --> 28:45.758
- Working...for Jerry.

28:45.792 --> 28:50.462
- And who is Jerry?
- The boss.

28:50.496 --> 28:52.832
He make us do the sex.

28:55.101 --> 28:56.903
- You just gave her a ride, huh?

28:56.936 --> 28:58.137
Well, where'd you pick her up?

28:58.170 --> 29:00.840
- In Queens, by Astoria Park.

29:00.873 --> 29:02.809
- By Astoria Park, huh?
You got an address?

29:02.842 --> 29:06.478
- I don't know.
She was on the street.

29:06.512 --> 29:08.414
On Ditmars.
- Did you ever see her

29:08.447 --> 29:09.782
before tonight?

29:09.816 --> 29:14.120
- I don't know. Maybe?

29:14.153 --> 29:17.924
I drive a lot of people.
- Yeah.

29:17.957 --> 29:21.961
- Jerry me da cincuenta dolare.

29:21.994 --> 29:24.897
I give it to the driver.

29:24.931 --> 29:27.399
He take me to a man.

29:28.968 --> 29:32.171
He wait.
I do the sex.

29:34.006 --> 29:38.110
Y él me lleva de vuelta.
He take me back.

29:38.144 --> 29:41.180
- And this driver,
the one tonight,

29:41.213 --> 29:44.050
has he driven you before?
- Sí.

29:44.083 --> 29:47.553
Before, many time, many time.

29:50.056 --> 29:51.958
- How'd you get the call
to pick her up?

29:51.991 --> 29:56.395
- Some guy on my cell.
I figured maybe her father.

29:56.428 --> 29:58.130
- Her father?
Send out his little girl

29:58.164 --> 30:00.199
wearing that much makeup,
dressed like that?

30:00.232 --> 30:02.201
- I don't know.
- You don't know.

30:02.234 --> 30:05.171
You know his name?
You know where

30:05.204 --> 30:09.141
he called you from?
- No. Why would I?

30:09.175 --> 30:12.578
- You're saying that you
never saw this girl before?

30:12.611 --> 30:16.148
- I...don't think so.

30:16.182 --> 30:18.184
[door clicks open]
- Know what?

30:18.217 --> 30:20.152
- You cut the crap.
The girl is talking.

30:20.186 --> 30:22.254
He drives her all the time.
50 bucks a pop.

30:22.288 --> 30:24.190
He waits half an hour,
and then he takes her back.

30:24.223 --> 30:25.892
- Really?

30:25.925 --> 30:27.093
Guess you thought
she was dropping off

30:27.126 --> 30:30.629
Girl Scout cookies, huh?

30:30.662 --> 30:35.001
- Okay, so maybe I suspect,
but I got nothing for you.

30:35.034 --> 30:36.568
I swear.

30:36.602 --> 30:40.639
- Jerry put me in car
and take me to driver man.

30:40.672 --> 30:43.242
- Okay, takes you from where?

30:43.275 --> 30:46.545
- La casa.

30:46.578 --> 30:49.215
Other girls there.

30:49.248 --> 30:55.621
Nosotras nos quedamos juntas.
We all stay there together.

30:55.654 --> 30:58.991
We come to America for job.
Pa trabajar.

30:59.025 --> 31:04.096
To work. No sex.

31:04.130 --> 31:06.132
- Okay, how many other girls?

31:06.165 --> 31:09.068
- Cuatro.

31:09.101 --> 31:13.272
Maria, Sofia,
Valeria, y Christabel.

31:13.305 --> 31:16.042
- And where is this house?

31:16.075 --> 31:19.211
- I do not know.
I'm sorry.

31:19.245 --> 31:21.480
I'm sorry.
I don't know.

31:21.513 --> 31:23.015
- You don't know.

31:23.049 --> 31:24.583
- Who brings her
to where you pick her up?

31:24.616 --> 31:26.652
- I don't know.
I never see him.

31:26.685 --> 31:29.188
- You don't know Jerry?
- Jerry who?

31:29.221 --> 31:33.125
- Okay, this guy,
where does he bring her from?

31:33.159 --> 31:34.693
- I don't know.

31:34.726 --> 31:37.163
- Listen, this is
your last chance.

31:37.196 --> 31:38.530
You're looking at 20 hard.

31:38.564 --> 31:41.100
- So I'd tell you if I knew.

31:41.133 --> 31:43.002
That's why he does it
the way he does.

31:43.035 --> 31:45.671
He fixes it so I don't know.

31:53.545 --> 31:57.049
- Is the house near where
the driver picks you up?

31:57.083 --> 32:02.088
- Yes, close.
We drive por cinco minutos.

32:02.121 --> 32:05.024
- What do you see on the drive?

32:05.057 --> 32:10.596
Do you see any stores?
Do you see any buildings?

32:10.629 --> 32:15.034
- Una casa de bombero.
Uh, fireman house?

32:15.067 --> 32:18.137
- So is there--is there
a number, a número,

32:18.170 --> 32:21.007
on the fire truck
or on the firehouse?

32:21.040 --> 32:22.608
- No.

32:22.641 --> 32:25.311
- Okay, um...

32:25.344 --> 32:27.313
And the house where you
live with the girls,

32:27.346 --> 32:31.583
is there a number
on that house?

32:31.617 --> 32:34.553
- I don't know.

32:34.586 --> 32:36.288
- Do you know the name
of the street?

32:36.322 --> 32:40.059
- No, I do not know.
I'm sorry.

32:40.092 --> 32:41.293
- It's okay.
- I'm sorry.

32:41.327 --> 32:43.062
- It's okay.

32:43.095 --> 32:44.696
- If he knows, he's not saying.

32:44.730 --> 32:46.598
- And I don't think he knows.
- How's the girl?

32:46.632 --> 32:49.335
- Scared, confused.

32:49.368 --> 32:50.769
- Hey.
- Hey.

32:50.802 --> 32:52.171
How's Fleming?
- He'll live.

32:52.204 --> 32:54.106
Bullet just grazed his head.

32:54.140 --> 32:55.774
I thought he was going
for another bottle of scotch,

32:55.807 --> 32:57.643
and he had a gun
stashed in there.

32:57.676 --> 32:59.345
The unis missed it.
- We gotta find this house

32:59.378 --> 33:01.113
where the pimp keeps
these girls before he runs.

33:01.147 --> 33:02.781
- What do we got?

33:02.814 --> 33:04.416
- All we know is that
it's a five-minute drive

33:04.450 --> 33:06.318
from the north end
of Astoria Park, and there's

33:06.352 --> 33:08.187
a fire station in between.

33:08.220 --> 33:11.057
- Well, Engine 312 is
on 35th Street south of Ditmars.

33:11.090 --> 33:13.059
- South of Ditmars,
near Steinway, okay.

33:13.092 --> 33:15.161
Let's look at Street View.

33:17.329 --> 33:19.598
Okay, Marian,
is that the firehouse

33:19.631 --> 33:21.333
that you were talking about?

33:21.367 --> 33:24.303
- Yes, I think.
- Okay, good, so, listen,

33:24.336 --> 33:28.207
we're gonna show you all
of the streets around that area,

33:28.240 --> 33:31.077
and you tell us if anything
looks familiar, okay?

33:31.110 --> 33:32.711
- Uh-huh.

33:39.285 --> 33:40.719
- Anything?

33:40.752 --> 33:43.289
- It all look same.

33:46.125 --> 33:48.360
- It's okay, you keep
looking, all right?

33:48.394 --> 33:53.732
Keep trying, anything,
any numbers.

33:53.765 --> 33:56.068
- Espera, espera.
Wait.

33:56.102 --> 33:58.270
We get fudgies there.
- Fudgies?

33:58.304 --> 33:59.805
- Mm-hmm, there.

33:59.838 --> 34:03.209
[speaks Spanish]
Bring good money...

34:03.242 --> 34:05.744
- Uh-huh.
- Jerry take us to buy fudgies.

34:05.777 --> 34:09.415
Como helado, like ice cream.
- Yes, yes, fudgsicles.

34:09.448 --> 34:11.817
- Okay, and how do you get
from the house to the store?

34:11.850 --> 34:15.087
- We walk, very close.
- Great.

34:15.121 --> 34:17.323
So we're in the right
neighborhood, okay.

34:28.534 --> 34:28.700
.

34:28.734 --> 34:28.967
- Okay.

34:31.470 --> 34:33.105
Which way, Marian?

34:48.254 --> 34:50.622
You see the house?

34:50.656 --> 34:52.491
- No.

34:52.524 --> 34:54.260
- Okay.

34:56.328 --> 34:59.165
- That one.

34:59.198 --> 35:00.366
[dramatic music]

35:00.399 --> 35:02.168
- You sure?
- Mm-hmm.

35:02.201 --> 35:05.504
The statue on the grass.
La Virgen, the Virgin.

35:05.537 --> 35:09.241
- Uh, number 3712, white door.
Let's go.

35:09.275 --> 35:16.282

[pounding]

35:33.965 --> 35:36.168
- NYPD!

35:38.237 --> 35:39.405
[crash]

35:39.438 --> 35:41.573
- Go. Go, go.
Go, go, go.

35:41.607 --> 35:44.210
- Get your hands up!
Sit your ass down!

35:44.243 --> 35:45.577
Sit down!
Don't move!

35:45.611 --> 35:47.213
- Where are they?
- What?

35:47.246 --> 35:49.181
- Your name Jerry?
- Yeah, why?

35:49.215 --> 35:50.949
What do you want?

35:50.982 --> 35:52.551
- There's nobody back here.
There's a door

35:52.584 --> 35:54.320
to the basement, locked.

35:54.353 --> 35:55.687
- Let's get it open.
- You have a warrant?

35:55.721 --> 35:58.224
- Yeah, and you're under arrest.
Get up.

35:58.257 --> 35:59.691
Let's go.

35:59.725 --> 36:01.693

[indistinct whispers and sobs]

36:20.246 --> 36:22.348
[girls gasping]

36:22.381 --> 36:23.715
- Quién eres?
Qué está pasando?

36:23.749 --> 36:25.717
- It's okay. It's okay.

36:25.751 --> 36:28.254
We're the police, all right?
Everything's gonna be okay.

36:28.287 --> 36:30.322
- Marian, where's Marian?

36:30.356 --> 36:32.458
- She's--she's good.
She's with us.

36:32.491 --> 36:35.727
- That guy Jerry's going
to jail right now.

36:35.761 --> 36:37.729
- It's gonna be okay.
Come on.

36:37.763 --> 36:40.532
Come on, let's get
you girls out of here.

36:44.536 --> 36:47.373
[indistinct chatter]

36:49.808 --> 36:53.512
- Great news, Rollins.
That's great.

36:53.545 --> 36:55.647
Okay, so call the CAC
and let them know

36:55.681 --> 36:57.483
that you're on your way.

36:57.516 --> 37:02.754
Okay, all good.
See you back at the squad.

37:02.788 --> 37:05.357
Mr. Duca, I was just
coming to see you.

37:05.391 --> 37:08.494
- This is harassment.
- No, this is a warning.

37:08.527 --> 37:12.631
If you ever post
another word about my son

37:12.664 --> 37:15.867
or Detective Rollins' daughter,
I will make it my life's mission

37:15.901 --> 37:17.836
to connect you to that
sex trafficking ring

37:17.869 --> 37:19.505
that we just busted.

37:19.538 --> 37:22.341
- I'm a journalist.
- No, you're not.

37:22.374 --> 37:24.776
You're a fraud.
You spread lies.

37:24.810 --> 37:26.778
You write stories
that you know are false

37:26.812 --> 37:28.847
just to create hysteria
and panic.

37:28.880 --> 37:30.616
- I just put it out there.

37:30.649 --> 37:32.584
If people wanna believe it,
that's on them.

37:32.618 --> 37:35.787
- No, this is on you.

37:35.821 --> 37:38.357
And I want
a full retraction today,

37:38.390 --> 37:42.461
by end of day today,
and, if not, I will arrest you

37:42.494 --> 37:45.831
on child pornography charges,
and I will do everything

37:45.864 --> 37:48.734
in my power to make them stick.
Do you understand me?

37:51.903 --> 37:54.473
We're clear.

37:58.410 --> 38:01.913
[sighing]

38:04.683 --> 38:06.718
The girls are all
from Central America.

38:06.752 --> 38:08.687
CAC will be getting in touch
with their families.

38:08.720 --> 38:11.490
They'll be getting counseling
and medical treatment here

38:11.523 --> 38:12.891
and then going home.

38:12.924 --> 38:14.560
- What kind of jobs
did they think they were

38:14.593 --> 38:16.828
gonna get in America?
- Nannies.

38:16.862 --> 38:19.665
Look, I've been checking in
on "The Endless Truth" website.

38:19.698 --> 38:21.633
They've backed off
on you and me.

38:21.667 --> 38:23.702
- You must've put the fear
of God in that guy, Duca.

38:23.735 --> 38:25.604
- That was the idea.

38:25.637 --> 38:26.905
- He is still going
after Congressman Bolton

38:26.938 --> 38:28.574
and the Coral Dragon.

38:28.607 --> 38:30.409
He's saying
"absence of evidence

38:30.442 --> 38:32.744
isn't evidence of absence."
- Dude is nuts.

38:32.778 --> 38:34.513
- Yeah, but,
if you think about it,

38:34.546 --> 38:35.781
his fake news
did lead us to a real

38:35.814 --> 38:37.716
sex trafficking ring
indirectly.

38:37.749 --> 38:39.551
- Send him a thank-you card?

38:39.585 --> 38:41.853
- No.

38:41.887 --> 38:44.523
- Lucy.
- Hi.

38:44.556 --> 38:46.925
- There he is.
Hi.

38:49.495 --> 38:51.363
Come here, sweet boy.

38:51.397 --> 38:55.734
- Lucy has a doggy.
- [chuckling] Yeah, she does.

38:55.767 --> 38:57.503
- Things go okay out there?

38:57.536 --> 38:58.770
- My mother wants
to adopt both of them.

38:58.804 --> 39:00.606
- Well, that's not happening.

39:00.639 --> 39:02.674
We're going home.
Right, Noah?

39:02.708 --> 39:04.610
- Two hours
of personal time?

39:04.643 --> 39:05.977
- Absolutely.

39:06.011 --> 39:08.547
Come on, sweetheart.
Come on, thanks.

39:08.580 --> 39:11.483
- Bye-bye.
- Thank you. Here we go.

39:11.517 --> 39:13.819
[phone buzzing]

39:13.852 --> 39:15.621
Benson, SVU.

39:16.788 --> 39:18.590
When?

39:19.891 --> 39:21.593
Okay, I'm coming.

39:21.627 --> 39:23.729
- What is it?

39:23.762 --> 39:25.864
- The restaurant.

39:29.668 --> 39:31.537
What happened?

39:31.570 --> 39:34.873
- The Congressman, he felt bad
my business was down.

39:34.906 --> 39:37.509
After you told the truth on TV,
he wanted to show people

39:37.543 --> 39:39.478
it was safe to come here.

39:39.511 --> 39:41.613
He came for lunch
with his daughter.

39:41.647 --> 39:44.750
He brought a photographer.

39:44.783 --> 39:46.518
That man came in with a gun.

39:46.552 --> 39:48.520
[camera shutter clicks]

39:48.554 --> 39:50.656
He saw the Congressman
with his daughter.

39:50.689 --> 39:52.558
He shouted at him.

39:52.591 --> 39:55.794
He thought the girl
he was with was...was a--

39:55.827 --> 39:57.929
- I know, I know, I know.

39:57.963 --> 39:59.965
