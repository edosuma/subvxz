00:06.089 --> 00:08.425
THIS SERIES IS INSPIRED BY A TRUE STORY

00:08.508 --> 00:11.886
BUT CHARACTERS AND EVENTS
HAVE BEEN REIMAGINED FOR DRAMATIC PURPOSES

00:13.054 --> 00:15.640
BRAZILIAN BORDER

00:20.645 --> 00:22.981
-Hey, what's happening?
-I don't know.

00:23.064 --> 00:24.315
Stop talking, you two.

00:25.150 --> 00:26.443
What's going on here?

00:27.068 --> 00:28.570
Are you crazy?

00:29.696 --> 00:31.156
Just stop. You'll get us killed.

00:31.239 --> 00:33.074
Don't make a move yet. I'll handle it.

00:33.158 --> 00:34.200
Hey!

00:34.284 --> 00:35.618
Speak clearly.

00:43.960 --> 00:45.003
What's all this?

00:45.086 --> 00:47.505
Okay, I'll be honest.

00:47.589 --> 00:49.507
We work here at a nearby mine,

00:49.591 --> 00:52.260
and we came here
to sell our goods to these people.

00:52.761 --> 00:55.096
Can you let us off just this once?

00:55.180 --> 00:57.223
Oh.

00:59.976 --> 01:02.312
This is a lot of money for these goods.

01:04.564 --> 01:05.940
Lima. Macedo.

01:06.024 --> 01:07.567
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

01:08.985 --> 01:10.111
Open it up.

01:32.217 --> 01:34.427
Ah, don't get us arrested, Park.

01:41.267 --> 01:42.477
Isn't this coke?

01:42.560 --> 01:43.394
What?

01:44.813 --> 01:47.107
Oh my God!

01:47.190 --> 01:49.025
I… I didn't know that was in there.

01:49.109 --> 01:50.777
Arrest all of them.

01:50.860 --> 01:52.737
Hey, you said that's a lot of money.

01:52.821 --> 01:54.114
But it's really not.

01:54.948 --> 01:57.575
It's a small amount
compared to the hard work you do.

01:58.827 --> 02:00.245
You really think so?

02:00.328 --> 02:02.539
Sure! We don't need this money.

02:02.622 --> 02:04.374
Hey. Okay.

02:04.457 --> 02:07.377
Um, if you think that's coke,
you can take it.

02:07.961 --> 02:10.964
We'll just leave this place peacefully
and never come back.

02:11.047 --> 02:14.968
Yeah. You can have everything.
We don't ever come back.

02:16.386 --> 02:17.512
Romeido.

02:18.304 --> 02:20.849
Take all the boxes
and check the truck for more.

02:20.932 --> 02:21.808
Yes, sir.

02:21.891 --> 02:24.435
-We have to leave soon. Hurry up!
-Yes, sir.

02:29.816 --> 02:31.317
Okay.

02:31.401 --> 02:35.029
We'll confiscate these goods
and let you all go.

02:35.113 --> 02:38.324
But don't you ever come around here again.

02:38.408 --> 02:39.993
Thank you, sir.

02:40.785 --> 02:41.661
Thank you, sir.

02:49.169 --> 02:50.503
Shit!

02:50.587 --> 02:51.671
Go back! Go back!

02:51.754 --> 02:53.006
What the fuck is that?

02:53.089 --> 02:54.424
What's going on?

02:54.507 --> 02:57.302
I think they're Suriname border guards.

02:57.385 --> 02:58.970
Just ignore them and go.

03:03.349 --> 03:05.351
Come on, move! Get out of my way!

03:17.655 --> 03:20.408
Shoot! Don't let them see you!

03:22.869 --> 03:24.495
Go! Get to the car now!

03:24.579 --> 03:25.580
Get to the car!

03:30.210 --> 03:31.753
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

03:32.587 --> 03:34.464
Fire at twelve o'clock!

03:40.845 --> 03:43.181
Report to 2nd Platoon!

03:45.016 --> 03:46.267
Look out!

03:59.781 --> 04:00.698
Go!

04:03.117 --> 04:04.118
Drive!

04:09.791 --> 04:10.625
Ah!

04:12.710 --> 04:15.004
Watch out! Take cover!

04:15.088 --> 04:16.297
Get on!

06:27.095 --> 06:29.097
"Blessed be the persecuted

06:30.139 --> 06:33.726
for as Jesus said
those whose crusade is just,

06:34.310 --> 06:36.562
they shall inherit heaven."

06:36.646 --> 06:37.814
Amen.

06:37.897 --> 06:39.065
Amen.

06:39.148 --> 06:40.108
Amen.

06:50.076 --> 06:52.662
You're telling me
that was the best you could do?

06:52.745 --> 06:54.205
What kind of plan was that?

06:54.288 --> 06:57.959
<i>The plan was to have</i>
<i>the cash and cocaine confiscated.</i>

06:58.042 --> 06:59.794
<i>The reality was a little different.</i>

06:59.877 --> 07:02.130
Then you should have
made damn sure I was okay.

07:04.799 --> 07:07.218
Regrettably, I was almost
a smear on the pavement.

07:08.428 --> 07:10.763
<i>You have every right to be angry.</i>

07:10.847 --> 07:13.558
But, ultimately, today was a success.

07:13.641 --> 07:17.103
We've delayed Jeon's shipment
by blocking his Brazil route.

07:17.186 --> 07:19.939
We've got a few days
to proceed with the next steps.

07:20.022 --> 07:22.275
I can't think
about next steps right now.

07:22.358 --> 07:24.777
I'm running out of reasons
to trust the NIS or you.

07:26.112 --> 07:28.489
Fair enough. What can I do
to make you trust us again?

07:28.573 --> 07:31.617
Start by telling the truth.
Because when you first approached me,

07:31.701 --> 07:33.744
you never said it would be this dangerous.

07:35.121 --> 07:37.707
I said your safety is my responsibility.

07:37.790 --> 07:40.168
Right. And you told me
that an agent would keep me safe,

07:40.251 --> 07:42.879
and that I should run
to the US Embassy if they couldn't.

07:42.962 --> 07:44.547
But look at today.

07:44.630 --> 07:47.008
Not a single agent or embassy out there.

07:47.091 --> 07:48.676
Who was looking out for me?

07:49.677 --> 07:52.013
We did our best with what we had.

07:52.096 --> 07:53.431
It's just not that simple.

07:53.514 --> 07:54.891
No, hold on.

07:54.974 --> 07:59.061
You know, while I was getting shot at
in the jungle, I realized something.

07:59.145 --> 08:03.024
If I just keep doing what you say,
I'm going to get myself killed.

08:03.858 --> 08:06.360
So here's how it's going to work
from this point on.

08:06.444 --> 08:08.696
I'm going to be the one calling the shots.

08:08.779 --> 08:11.532
This operation goes far beyond
the two of us, Mr. Kang.

08:11.616 --> 08:14.702
This is international
with multiple players involved!

08:14.785 --> 08:18.372
Well, why don't you all get together
and figure it all out for yourselves?

08:18.456 --> 08:21.417
I'm the one
who's risking my life here, not you!

08:36.766 --> 08:39.852
<i>A firefight broke out</i>
<i>between Brazilian soldiers</i>

08:39.936 --> 08:43.314
<i>and Surinamese drug gangs</i>
<i>at the Brazilian frontier.</i>

08:43.397 --> 08:47.235
<i>In the midst of constant crimes</i>
<i>committed by big drug gangs,</i>

08:47.318 --> 08:52.532
<i>the Brazilian government said it's time</i>
<i>to wage a war against drug trafficking.</i>

08:52.615 --> 08:56.911
<i>The Brazilian government intercepted</i>
<i>a large amount of cocaine and money</i>

08:56.994 --> 08:58.663
<i>from the gang members…</i>

08:58.746 --> 09:00.039
What?

09:00.122 --> 09:03.084
I can't withdraw anything?
Not even a dollar?

09:04.085 --> 09:07.296
Is there anything else I can try?

09:15.179 --> 09:17.056
Oh shit!

09:19.350 --> 09:21.435
Okay, I'll call you later.

09:23.354 --> 09:24.855
Uh, Pastor…

09:25.606 --> 09:29.151
Our European bank accounts are locked.
I can't access them.

09:29.860 --> 09:33.197
Panama, Curaçao, Bahamas. Everyone.

09:34.240 --> 09:35.074
What happened?

09:35.157 --> 09:38.911
It would appear
that all our accounts are frozen.

09:41.455 --> 09:42.707
Out of nowhere?

09:42.790 --> 09:45.293
We know who gave the order. Europol.

09:45.376 --> 09:50.464
I'm asking why would they suddenly freeze
all of my accounts!

09:51.382 --> 09:54.927
I believe it must be the border incident.

09:55.011 --> 09:57.054
Some of our church members
were picked up in Brazil.

09:57.138 --> 09:58.848
They must've told the police something.

10:04.604 --> 10:05.730
Shit.

10:08.733 --> 10:10.818
We were intercepted by the Brazilian army

10:10.901 --> 10:13.654
in the middle of the Amazonian jungle
on our first sale?

10:13.738 --> 10:16.907
Statistically, what are the chances
of that happening?

10:16.991 --> 10:18.784
And then, to make matters worse,

10:18.868 --> 10:21.829
Europol interferes,
and my accounts are frozen?

10:24.248 --> 10:28.502
Someone among us
is going against God's will.

10:28.586 --> 10:31.255
A trader who is possessed by Satan.

10:36.552 --> 10:38.721
They patched me up. What's going on?

10:42.725 --> 10:45.227
I was on the phone with Mr. Goo.

10:45.311 --> 10:49.023
Is there a plan? He wants to know
if you're able to make it up to him.

10:49.106 --> 10:51.150
What? "Make it up"?

10:51.233 --> 10:54.362
Your plan wasn't well-thought-out,
and that's why we almost died out there.

10:54.445 --> 10:59.408
Plus, 20 billion won worth of product,
not to mention all of his cash, is gone.

10:59.492 --> 11:00.868
We could file for damages.

11:00.951 --> 11:03.996
Under international law we'd be able to.
You know that.

11:04.080 --> 11:07.166
Hey, you better shut the fuck up
and show the pastor some respect.

11:07.249 --> 11:08.209
You stay out of this.

11:12.171 --> 11:13.005
It's funny,

11:13.714 --> 11:16.300
I've been trying to figure out
whose been leaking our secrets,

11:16.384 --> 11:20.471
and until it becomes clear who that is,
I need you to stay right here.

11:21.180 --> 11:24.684
Who organized the schedule?
Who put the whole plan together?

11:25.267 --> 11:26.644
All of this is on you.

11:29.522 --> 11:33.693
Look, I feel like there's been
some misunderstandings between us.

11:33.776 --> 11:36.529
How about you and I
just call the whole thing off?

11:37.238 --> 11:39.240
The location and schedule…

11:39.865 --> 11:42.159
You knew just as much
about them as we did.

11:43.160 --> 11:44.829
What the hell is this?

11:44.912 --> 11:49.041
You realize I was the one who remembered
to bring back all the product, right?

11:49.125 --> 11:51.168
You don't think that's worth your trust?

11:51.669 --> 11:55.256
Okay. Pretend the border guard showing up
was a coincidence.

11:55.339 --> 11:58.426
Even after that,
things still could have gone smoothly.

11:58.509 --> 12:01.470
What good did calling for back-up do?
I'm asking you, Pastor?

12:01.554 --> 12:03.431
Why would he do that? Huh?

12:04.223 --> 12:06.976
All that belongs to the pastor
belongs to God.

12:07.518 --> 12:09.437
Protecting the product was right and just.

12:10.062 --> 12:12.273
Oh, I bet you'd think that, wouldn't you?

12:12.356 --> 12:14.066
Oh enough!

12:14.859 --> 12:19.864
That's enough of this bickering.
Just let me take one good look at you,

12:19.947 --> 12:21.907
and I'll know if you're a devil.

12:52.396 --> 12:54.315
Pastor,

12:54.940 --> 12:57.777
why all the theatrics
over something so simple?

12:58.486 --> 13:02.198
You have to think about motivations.
Not the devil's, but man's.

13:02.281 --> 13:04.700
Someone doesn't want us selling to Korea.

13:05.326 --> 13:07.787
And that would be Chen Zhen.

13:08.412 --> 13:10.581
Isn't there someone
who used to run with him?

13:10.664 --> 13:13.584
Someone who still speaks
to him in Mandarin.

13:14.960 --> 13:16.670
Looks like a rat.

13:16.754 --> 13:19.215
You fucking bastard!
You fucking liar!

13:19.298 --> 13:20.966
Father…

13:21.050 --> 13:23.052
…give me the word
and I'll take care of him for you.

13:23.135 --> 13:25.721
You impious devil spawn, I warned you!

13:28.307 --> 13:31.435
You're not gonna stop acting
like some thug, is that it?

13:31.519 --> 13:33.270
Come on, you piece of shit!

13:35.648 --> 13:37.942
Do you believe that you are free of sin?

13:38.651 --> 13:41.487
No, Pastor, no.
I beg God's forgiveness every day.

13:41.570 --> 13:43.823
-Hey, Byun Kitae.
-Yes, sir.

13:43.906 --> 13:45.199
Is that the devil I see?

13:45.282 --> 13:46.867
No, Pastor, he's not here!

14:05.094 --> 14:08.472
One of you
betrayed our Lord God today.

14:09.181 --> 14:10.933
And I will find out which one!

14:11.767 --> 14:12.726
Hear this.

14:14.186 --> 14:16.021
I need you to act in good faith.

14:16.105 --> 14:17.064
Amen.

14:17.940 --> 14:19.233
Yes, sir.

14:22.236 --> 14:24.655
All of this church stuff isn't my scene.

14:25.906 --> 14:27.408
I'll leave this to you.

14:27.491 --> 14:29.076
You can have fun hunting the devil.

14:29.159 --> 14:30.494
Pastor, look.

14:31.370 --> 14:33.539
Why don't we just end our agreement?

14:37.501 --> 14:41.297
Brother, why end the partnership
when we just cleared the air?

14:41.380 --> 14:42.256
I know you.

14:44.967 --> 14:46.510
Why don't we take a walk?

14:58.939 --> 15:01.525
Mr. Kang,
your quick thinking saved the day.

15:01.609 --> 15:04.320
Not to mention 100 kilos of my cocaine.

15:04.403 --> 15:07.197
The bullets were flying.
It was very brave of you.

15:07.281 --> 15:09.825
What do you mean "brave"?
I just did it.

15:09.909 --> 15:12.077
It was my money out there on the line.

15:15.956 --> 15:17.458
Your money, was it?

15:19.710 --> 15:21.712
The closer we get, Mr. Kang,

15:23.213 --> 15:25.257
the more I like what I see.

15:25.341 --> 15:27.635
Well, I don't like
the situation that we're in.

15:27.718 --> 15:28.677
The plan's coming apart.

15:29.887 --> 15:32.306
And yet, what if our business ends?

15:32.932 --> 15:36.352
How on earth would you make that money
you love so much?

15:36.435 --> 15:38.187
As you know, I spoke to Mr. Goo.

15:38.270 --> 15:40.564
He's… he's pretty furious.

15:44.193 --> 15:47.613
I appreciate what you're saying.
Why don't you go lie down?

15:48.113 --> 15:51.075
Let me take you somewhere tomorrow.
You've got a clean suit?

16:01.293 --> 16:02.670
KANG, LET'S HAVE A CHAT
SANGMAN

16:06.924 --> 16:10.886
Yeah. I led on that we were threatening
to call it off.

16:10.970 --> 16:14.306
Let's see how he plays his hand
knowing that. We can go from there.

16:14.390 --> 16:15.683
Then, that's the plan.

16:15.766 --> 16:17.142
But don't forget,

16:17.226 --> 16:19.687
you do what you have to do
to get him to the US.

16:19.770 --> 16:22.439
We're impressed with your work
and hope it continues.

16:23.023 --> 16:26.068
Hey, I should be saying that to you,
but I'm losing patience.

16:26.151 --> 16:29.822
If anything else goes sideways
on this mission, I'm out. Understand?

16:33.867 --> 16:36.495
There won't be any more
situations like that.

16:38.288 --> 16:40.374
Well, I'm really hoping so.

16:52.553 --> 16:53.554
Sihyeon.

16:54.805 --> 16:56.807
K's phone, you're able to bug it?

16:56.890 --> 16:57.808
Yes, sir.

16:57.891 --> 16:59.727
Then make it happen. Be subtle.

17:40.225 --> 17:42.978
PRESIDENTIAL PALACE, SURINAME

18:05.584 --> 18:07.628
Delano, my friend!

18:11.924 --> 18:12.925
-Ah, Mr. Kang.
-Yes, yes.

18:13.008 --> 18:15.969
This is Suriname's president,
Delano Alvares.

18:17.888 --> 18:19.098
This is Mr. Kang.

18:19.181 --> 18:21.100
He has a very big company.

18:21.183 --> 18:22.267
Mmm.

18:22.351 --> 18:25.145
Pastor Jeon told me lot about you.

18:25.229 --> 18:27.481
Uh, what business you run in Korea?

18:28.816 --> 18:31.401
I… You didn't tell him about me?

18:31.485 --> 18:33.737
Uh, a karaoke business.

18:33.821 --> 18:37.282
-And I--
-Hey, don't be so modest about it.

18:38.283 --> 18:42.121
He had a big entertainment company
for the US Army in Korea.

18:42.204 --> 18:43.080
Mmm.

18:43.747 --> 18:47.334
And, uh, distribution rights
for Samsung Electronics

18:47.417 --> 18:50.379
in the whole of America!

18:51.547 --> 18:52.923
Oh! No, no, no, no, no.

18:53.006 --> 18:54.508
Only South America.

18:55.300 --> 18:57.219
Samsung?

18:58.011 --> 18:59.471
What honor.

19:01.723 --> 19:04.810
And I also worked
with Hyundai Motors for ten years.

19:05.352 --> 19:08.647
If you want to buy a new car,
call me anytime.

19:08.730 --> 19:10.691
Thank you.

19:10.774 --> 19:12.067
Can I shake your hand again?

19:12.693 --> 19:15.070
Thank you, Mr. President.

19:19.908 --> 19:21.618
Come.

19:37.134 --> 19:39.386
How about that favor
I asked about on the phone?

19:39.928 --> 19:40.762
Ah.

19:41.471 --> 19:43.640
They make really big fuss.

19:44.683 --> 19:50.814
Brazil's pushing us
to turn over anyone involved in incident.

19:53.775 --> 19:56.320
I think you better agree to request.

20:01.700 --> 20:03.285
Then…

20:03.368 --> 20:06.163
How about sending
a couple of Chen Zhen's boys?

20:07.581 --> 20:10.334
Brazilian can't tell Koreans from Chinese.

20:11.210 --> 20:12.085
Hmm.

20:15.339 --> 20:16.340
Oh, yeah.

20:20.552 --> 20:21.929
HONEY APPLES FROM DAEGU

20:27.601 --> 20:28.936
You know the saying,

20:29.853 --> 20:32.189
"A friend in need is a friend indeed"?

20:33.023 --> 20:36.693
Our powerful new friend here
can help us open new markets,

20:36.777 --> 20:38.528
and grow our business.

20:39.029 --> 20:42.032
This will only make our friendship deeper.

20:47.537 --> 20:51.875
This,
my favorite kind of apple.

20:53.377 --> 20:57.089
Friendship will be rewarded
with friendship.

20:57.839 --> 20:59.299
Of course.

21:00.008 --> 21:01.343
In God we trust.

21:02.094 --> 21:02.928
Ah.

21:03.011 --> 21:04.805
And in each other.

21:08.100 --> 21:09.643
That's the thing about Delano.

21:09.726 --> 21:14.606
It didn't use to take so much to move him
when we were first starting out.

21:14.690 --> 21:17.943
But now the president's too old
and lazy for our use.

21:18.026 --> 21:19.653
A broken down car.

21:20.445 --> 21:21.905
The mileage on it is awful.

21:23.907 --> 21:24.992
Oh.

21:25.075 --> 21:26.159
I should say

21:26.660 --> 21:30.080
that you and Delano
are both your old schoolmates.

21:30.163 --> 21:31.331
Schoolmates?

21:32.165 --> 21:34.543
Ah, you mean prisoners?

21:36.003 --> 21:38.171
Uh, Sint Maarten School.

21:38.839 --> 21:40.632
The president went there on drug charges.

21:40.716 --> 21:42.676
Ah! Oh my God!

21:44.344 --> 21:46.096
Suriname has a few big industries,

21:46.179 --> 21:48.181
but three quarters of the country
works in drugs.

21:48.265 --> 21:52.602
You could say
that we're the ones driving the economy.

21:53.145 --> 21:55.314
And meanwhile, that little man

21:55.397 --> 21:58.734
is worried about nothing more
than his pathetic bribes.

21:59.318 --> 22:02.529
Yeah, he should be thinking
about his country's future.

22:03.238 --> 22:04.448
Hey,

22:04.531 --> 22:06.825
why did you want me
to meet the president today?

22:10.329 --> 22:11.788
To promote our vision.

22:13.123 --> 22:14.207
Our vision?

22:17.044 --> 22:18.503
Mr. Kang,

22:18.587 --> 22:20.297
I'm going to promise you this.

22:20.380 --> 22:22.883
I'll destroy that fucking rat.

22:24.468 --> 22:26.053
Yes, I should hope so.

22:26.636 --> 22:28.805
Look, Byun Kitae makes me nervous.

22:29.723 --> 22:32.059
There's something
about David too, isn't there?

22:32.934 --> 22:34.144
<i> David is…</i>

22:35.020 --> 22:37.898
<i>He wouldn't even tie his shoes</i>
<i>unless I said so.</i>

22:37.981 --> 22:40.734
<i>He's a coward. He lacks ambition.</i>

22:41.485 --> 22:42.611
<i>Maybe so,</i>

22:42.694 --> 22:45.489
<i>but you can never really know</i>
<i>what someone's thinking.</i>

22:48.116 --> 22:49.076
Yeah?

22:50.952 --> 22:53.580
I'm thinking you deserve
to know everything

22:53.663 --> 22:55.874
that's running through my brain today.

22:55.957 --> 22:56.792
Okay?

23:17.270 --> 23:19.064
Even without this rat problem,

23:19.147 --> 23:22.275
I'd still be disappointed
with all the guys that work for me.

23:22.359 --> 23:23.193
All of them.

23:23.985 --> 23:27.572
I've seen so little ambition or skill
to become my partner.

23:29.157 --> 23:31.660
Obviously,
Kitae is not Korean like we are.

23:32.244 --> 23:34.704
I'd much rather work
with people that are like me.

23:34.788 --> 23:37.332
Then David's just… He's petty, right?

23:37.416 --> 23:39.418
And Sangjun's fighting spirit is…

23:40.377 --> 23:41.628
He's a little much.

23:41.711 --> 23:43.672
Shit. Yeah.

23:44.548 --> 23:46.758
The real trouble in life is people.

23:50.053 --> 23:51.680
MILITARY ZONE

24:09.322 --> 24:10.365
Nice.

24:18.582 --> 24:19.708
From here,

24:20.292 --> 24:23.545
to as far as your eye can see,
it's all military.

24:23.628 --> 24:25.589
That's what the president told me.

24:26.798 --> 24:29.801
Nobody can even photograph the area,
let alone come for a visit.

24:37.517 --> 24:38.977
You see that plant there?

24:39.644 --> 24:41.188
Processing facility.

24:41.938 --> 24:44.524
And the canal's straight to the Atlantic.

24:46.860 --> 24:50.280
All that's left to do
is start growing the coca there.

24:51.323 --> 24:52.782
Wait a minute. So,

24:52.866 --> 24:55.911
you're going to produce and distribute
the cocaine from here?

24:57.871 --> 25:01.458
We have to keep begging the Colombians
for more and more product.

25:03.168 --> 25:04.419
Barely any profit margin.

25:04.503 --> 25:07.923
And besides, I'm hungry for it.

25:16.932 --> 25:18.391
How long until it's up and running?

25:20.977 --> 25:24.940
You might be surprised by how much
this sort of undertaking actually costs.

25:25.023 --> 25:26.942
I was figuring about three years.

25:27.025 --> 25:29.402
That was before
you got us a route to Korea.

25:29.486 --> 25:31.238
And with the money from that,

25:31.321 --> 25:33.323
well, make it six months.

25:37.786 --> 25:38.620
Huh.

25:54.511 --> 25:55.887
Good shot!

26:04.479 --> 26:07.440
If you do well with the route
when our kingdom is built,

26:07.524 --> 26:09.192
I want you in charge.

26:09.276 --> 26:10.735
You'll be my managing director.

26:12.737 --> 26:16.783
We'll be side-by-side, huh?
The whole operation will be yours.

26:21.913 --> 26:23.081
Managing director?

26:23.164 --> 26:25.667
You've got to trust
that impulse in your gut.

26:25.750 --> 26:28.211
Making money is part of your DNA.

26:28.295 --> 26:30.297
So let's make some real money.

26:31.047 --> 26:34.050
And if that doesn't convince you,
I'll give you ten percent.

26:40.557 --> 26:43.143
Beautiful. Beautiful.

26:43.768 --> 26:46.271
Naturally, it'll depend,

26:46.354 --> 26:48.982
but you could make 12 billion won a year.

26:49.566 --> 26:51.401
Imagine sending half that back home.

26:51.484 --> 26:56.156
Imagine your wife's brand-new car.
Imagine your children's school.

26:59.492 --> 27:01.911
I'm honored
you even thought of me, Pastor.

27:01.995 --> 27:03.705
No more pastor.

27:03.788 --> 27:05.415
We're friends, you and me.

27:05.498 --> 27:09.085
So when it's just us,
no pastor or whatever.

27:09.169 --> 27:11.963
Just, fuck it, you know?
You and me.

27:12.047 --> 27:13.131
Let's keep it cool.

27:15.884 --> 27:17.677
<i>Do you ever play golf?</i>

27:17.761 --> 27:19.679
<i>You look like the sporting type.</i>

27:19.763 --> 27:22.932
<i>Oh, sports don't make money,</i>
<i>so I don't bother.</i>

27:24.434 --> 27:25.852
<i> You know what?</i>

27:27.187 --> 27:31.316
I love people like you
who are so damn pragmatic in life.

27:31.399 --> 27:34.694
The majority of folks here,
their heads are up in the clouds.

27:36.029 --> 27:38.323
Maybe they're looking
for an escape from their lives.

27:38.406 --> 27:41.993
And that is why drugs sell so well.

27:42.077 --> 27:44.037
You get to glimpse behind the curtain.

27:44.120 --> 27:46.164
You see things you've never seen.

27:46.247 --> 27:47.666
Life changing.

27:47.749 --> 27:49.000
Ah.

27:49.084 --> 27:49.918
Oh.

27:54.839 --> 27:58.551
It's, uh, Mr. Goo.
He's absolutely furious.

27:59.052 --> 28:00.679
He wants to get out of South America.

28:00.762 --> 28:04.516
That bastard!
That coward is going to ruin everything.

28:05.308 --> 28:07.811
Tell me, what do you think of my vision?

28:08.520 --> 28:10.647
I've shown you my hopes for the future.

28:12.148 --> 28:14.859
And if I can be honest for a moment,
I was…

28:15.610 --> 28:18.405
I'm overwhelmed. Really.
I'm truly honored.

28:20.073 --> 28:21.241
I appreciate it.

28:24.869 --> 28:26.955
Then smooth things out with Mr. Goo.

28:27.038 --> 28:30.875
Have him find us another route to Korea
to further our vision.

28:32.585 --> 28:33.712
Now.

28:33.795 --> 28:36.089
Now it's your turn to have to decide.

28:36.965 --> 28:40.552
To be, or not to be, that is the question.

28:50.895 --> 28:55.024
<i>All right. The time has come</i>
<i>to bait the hook for Mr. Jeon.</i>

28:56.317 --> 28:58.862
But I've only just gotten him to trust me.

28:58.945 --> 29:00.321
Just give me more time.

29:00.405 --> 29:02.699
<i>Look at it from Yohan's perspective.</i>

29:02.782 --> 29:05.535
<i>He hasn't been able</i>
<i>to move any product. None.</i>

29:05.618 --> 29:07.328
<i>So let a little bit more cocaine come in.</i>

29:08.163 --> 29:09.706
<i>We can wait for the perfect moment.</i>

29:09.789 --> 29:12.625
His bank accounts
are all still frozen, get it?

29:12.709 --> 29:15.879
He owes the Colombians
a massive amount of money, Mr. Kang.

29:15.962 --> 29:18.339
We corner him and we flush him out.

29:19.924 --> 29:21.426
Look, I get that's the plan,

29:21.509 --> 29:24.888
but messing this up
because we rushed isn't an option.

29:24.971 --> 29:27.182
Slow down, we'll get him.
Don't make a mistake.

29:29.309 --> 29:30.435
Hang on a sec.

29:31.186 --> 29:34.355
You're telling me
you're not taking orders from us anymore?

29:35.356 --> 29:37.108
Hey, no, it's not like that.

29:37.192 --> 29:40.445
I'm just asking you
to respect my opinion in all this.

29:40.528 --> 29:42.030
I've got different intel.

29:45.366 --> 29:47.160
Let me just ask you this, Mr. Kang.

29:47.827 --> 29:50.330
Are you and I
still pursuing the same goal?

29:54.042 --> 29:58.129
I just want to know
if you have any ulterior motives in this.

29:58.213 --> 29:59.672
Because, if you do,

29:59.756 --> 30:02.926
<i>you won't change our plan.</i>
<i>You'll just be in the way.</i>

30:03.843 --> 30:05.220
Shit.

30:16.147 --> 30:19.108
Sir, I have to believe
that Kang isn't switching sides,

30:19.192 --> 30:21.528
but don't we need
some kind of backup plan?

30:31.037 --> 30:33.873
Agent Choi, it's the DEA.
Will you take it?

30:44.133 --> 30:45.468
So how did it go?

30:45.552 --> 30:48.346
Ah, Mr. Goo is such a pain in the ass.

30:49.222 --> 30:50.557
I had to beg him.

30:51.140 --> 30:53.309
But he'll find us another route.

30:53.393 --> 30:54.269
He's back on board.

30:55.687 --> 30:58.064
Look who did it. Hey!

30:58.147 --> 30:59.899
Didn't I tell you? Huh?

30:59.983 --> 31:02.360
Thanks to me, we have hope once again.

31:03.069 --> 31:04.237
So how about it?

31:04.863 --> 31:07.323
-We building a kingdom or what?
-Okay!

31:07.407 --> 31:09.367
Oh shit. Wow.

31:09.450 --> 31:12.495
It sure is a beautiful day, partner.

31:12.579 --> 31:13.830
You want to give it a go?

31:16.249 --> 31:17.750
Sure.

31:17.834 --> 31:19.377
Okay, let's see here.

31:20.044 --> 31:21.045
Oh yeah.

31:21.129 --> 31:22.046
Whoa!

31:22.755 --> 31:25.091
All right, I'll give this thing a shot.

31:26.509 --> 31:29.262
Ah, come on!

31:29.345 --> 31:31.764
-It’s okay, it's okay. It happens.
-One more.

31:35.727 --> 31:37.896
-Oh shit.
-Oh!

31:40.899 --> 31:42.817
Bravo!

31:42.901 --> 31:46.195
What a shot! Bravo!

31:46.279 --> 31:48.781
DEA HEADQUARTERS
ARLINGTON, VIRGINIA

31:55.580 --> 31:58.917
If we can get Jeon,
he will lead us to the finances.

31:59.000 --> 32:03.504
Distribution channels and networks
of the Colombian Cali Cartel.

32:03.588 --> 32:05.757
You'll get major intel
on the biggest cartel

32:05.840 --> 32:08.051
supplying drugs directly into the US.

32:09.719 --> 32:12.555
It'll help with the DEA's goal
of sweeping them up.

32:14.891 --> 32:19.771
So, this operation basically is a war
against the Cali Cartel.

32:21.064 --> 32:22.607
War against Cali?

32:23.733 --> 32:25.360
Well, that's twisted logic.

32:27.195 --> 32:28.863
But it's also convincing.

32:31.866 --> 32:32.700
Good.

32:33.326 --> 32:36.621
If Jeon's drugs enter US territory,
according to your plan,

32:36.704 --> 32:40.833
then DEA Special Forces would immediately
enter Suriname to capture him.

32:41.501 --> 32:43.795
You made a wise decision.

32:48.132 --> 32:49.050
However,

32:53.012 --> 32:54.973
this is a sting operation,

32:55.598 --> 32:58.434
which could give us trouble
with US Congress down the line.

32:58.518 --> 33:01.938
So I want all budgetary concerns
covered by NIS,

33:02.021 --> 33:06.442
and we will only be participating
in an unofficial capacity.

33:07.360 --> 33:08.528
Most important,

33:09.529 --> 33:11.197
you must use mercenaries.

33:15.201 --> 33:17.370
Absolutely. Don't worry.

33:24.669 --> 33:27.338
WASHINGTON, D.C., USA

33:36.347 --> 33:38.433
<i>Sangman, what's up? Can we talk?</i>

33:38.516 --> 33:41.769
Why are you calling, huh?
I told you I'd call later.

33:43.438 --> 33:44.605
It's Pastor Jeon.

33:45.189 --> 33:46.149
Oh, right.

33:46.232 --> 33:48.026
The pro with ten years of experience

33:48.109 --> 33:51.821
who somehow managed
to fuck up a simple delivery so badly.

33:55.074 --> 33:57.035
Took the words out of my mouth.

33:58.161 --> 34:00.246
Why don't we save the chit-chat for later?

34:00.329 --> 34:02.623
There's more important business
to discuss.

34:03.624 --> 34:05.960
Mr. Kang informed me that

34:06.044 --> 34:08.171
you found us a brand-new route to Korea.

34:36.949 --> 34:38.701
Hello? Sangman.

34:41.245 --> 34:42.246
What are you doing?

34:42.330 --> 34:43.998
Is everything good?

34:44.082 --> 34:45.500
Mr. Goo, hello?

34:47.627 --> 34:51.255
Do you believe this?
Who the hell does he think he is?

35:00.890 --> 35:02.892
Send your goods to Puerto Rico.

35:04.977 --> 35:07.063
What did you say? Puerto Rico?

35:19.075 --> 35:21.702
Mmm, our path through Brazil
is blocked off.

35:21.786 --> 35:24.080
It's only possible to get to Korea
through Puerto Rico.

35:24.664 --> 35:28.584
But don't worry, there's an aid ship
that goes back and forth between the two.

35:29.752 --> 35:31.838
Make sure your product
ends up on the ship.

35:31.921 --> 35:35.675
Then it'll be put on a plane to Korea
destined for the US bases there.

35:35.758 --> 35:38.845
There's just one problem…

35:38.928 --> 35:40.471
I can still hear you, Mr. Goo.

35:42.181 --> 35:45.226
This plane,
it's two weeks from flying out.

35:45.309 --> 35:46.936
That means we don't have much time.

35:47.019 --> 35:49.313
So we've got only two more weeks

35:49.397 --> 35:53.651
to get our product to Puerto Rico
before the window is closed?

35:53.734 --> 35:55.820
<i>Right. That's our only option.</i>

35:56.529 --> 35:59.115
Listen, we don't want another mistake.

36:00.867 --> 36:02.410
Don't worry about it.

36:02.493 --> 36:04.287
The Suriname government will help.

36:04.370 --> 36:06.622
They'll pack the product
on the ship for us.

36:07.832 --> 36:09.458
So, Mr. Goo, is everything good?

36:17.300 --> 36:21.053
Get this underway as fast as you can,
and we'll focus…

36:35.151 --> 36:36.235
Mr. Kang.

36:37.361 --> 36:39.030
What the hell?

36:40.573 --> 36:41.449
What do you mean?

36:42.408 --> 36:46.329
Puerto Rico is US territory,
for fuck's sake.

36:58.925 --> 36:59.967
The US?

37:02.929 --> 37:05.765
Hello? You there, Pastor?

37:05.848 --> 37:06.891
You hang up?

37:07.516 --> 37:08.517
Ingu?

37:10.478 --> 37:11.812
Mr. Goo,

37:11.896 --> 37:15.066
As soon as the US gets involved in this,
you'll have nowhere to hide.

37:15.149 --> 37:16.400
You know that, don't you?

37:16.484 --> 37:18.236
What are you talking about?

37:18.945 --> 37:20.738
What's the US got to do with it?

37:21.864 --> 37:23.241
Hey, excuse me.

37:23.324 --> 37:26.244
You're aware Puerto Rico
is basically a US state, right?

37:28.746 --> 37:30.414
Yeah, sure, I know that.

37:30.498 --> 37:33.000
Territorial sovereignty
is pretty complicated,

37:33.084 --> 37:35.169
but, uh, they're not the same.

37:35.253 --> 37:37.755
Hey, what is this, history class? Come on?

37:38.798 --> 37:43.052
Sangman, just hang on a second
and explain what you mean.

37:44.178 --> 37:46.806
<i>Remember the baseball classic</i>
<i>earlier this year?</i>

37:46.889 --> 37:48.224
What about the WBC?

37:48.307 --> 37:49.892
<i>I didn't watch it religiously,</i>

37:49.976 --> 37:52.144
but, uh, Puerto Rico is one of the teams.

37:52.228 --> 37:54.689
I know you love baseball. You remember.

37:54.772 --> 37:58.276
<i>I do. Puerto Rico was eliminated</i>
<i>in the second round.</i>

37:58.943 --> 37:59.819
Yes, exactly.

37:59.902 --> 38:03.030
And both the US and Puerto Rico competed.

38:03.823 --> 38:05.116
So, Pastor, tell me.

38:05.199 --> 38:08.744
If it was basically a US state,
how is that possible?

38:08.828 --> 38:12.790
They share a close bond with the US,
but Puerto Rico has its own government.

38:12.873 --> 38:15.710
In reality, they're pretty much separate.

38:16.294 --> 38:17.378
Yeah, yeah.

38:18.754 --> 38:22.091
You've made yourself very clear, Sangman.

38:23.551 --> 38:25.303
Then Puerto Rico is the goal.

38:25.970 --> 38:27.722
Don't mess it up this time.

38:34.895 --> 38:36.522
It's important you understand…

38:43.487 --> 38:46.032
when you're talking drugs, guns, or money,

38:47.158 --> 38:50.328
the very last thing you want
is for the US to get involved.

38:50.911 --> 38:54.957
<i>So, find me another route</i>
<i>that's nowhere near the States. Got it?</i>

38:58.878 --> 39:02.048
Hang on.
We only had a month to pull off this deal.

39:02.131 --> 39:04.342
And you were the ones
who had to go and mess it all up.

39:04.425 --> 39:07.470
Ingu asked me to find a new route for you.

39:07.553 --> 39:08.888
Now you want another?

39:08.971 --> 39:10.473
<i>The situation's changed, no?</i>

39:10.556 --> 39:13.100
We'll have to be even more careful now.

39:13.184 --> 39:15.853
You can have more time,
just find us another route.

39:15.936 --> 39:18.606
What? You're giving me time?

39:19.440 --> 39:21.025
What? I work for you guys now?

39:25.363 --> 39:27.073
What's with the attitude?

39:29.367 --> 39:31.869
Ah shit, man. You're pissing me off.

39:32.661 --> 39:35.206
Which one of us
fucked up the meeting, huh?

39:35.289 --> 39:38.667
When you go and shit the bed,
the least you could do is clean it up.

39:39.502 --> 39:41.879
You must be possessed by the devil.

39:42.421 --> 39:45.132
That is some fucking tone to take with me.

39:45.716 --> 39:48.344
How do I know
you won't behave like amateurs again?

39:48.427 --> 39:50.221
Why am I taking all of the risk?

39:50.304 --> 39:52.515
I'm supposed to just trust you?

39:52.598 --> 39:54.350
If that's what you think, then fuck it.

39:58.646 --> 39:59.897
Sangman.

39:59.980 --> 40:01.232
Can I? Thanks.

40:02.858 --> 40:04.485
Hey, why don't we do this?

40:04.568 --> 40:07.196
Look, since both of you
make some good points,

40:07.279 --> 40:09.281
let's try to compromise and work it out.

40:09.365 --> 40:12.076
<i>Kang, what the hell?</i>
<i>Is this a fucking joke to you?</i>

40:12.159 --> 40:15.704
You want me to keep messing around
with a bunch of fucking clowns?

40:16.664 --> 40:18.666
Hey, man, what's with the language?

40:18.749 --> 40:20.876
This isn't how I work.

40:20.960 --> 40:23.462
I'm not doing business
like this, Kang, okay?

40:23.546 --> 40:25.131
You keep up this bullshit,

40:25.214 --> 40:27.925
and I'll have no choice
but to call off the deal. Got it?

40:28.008 --> 40:29.718
You can't just call it off.

40:29.802 --> 40:31.595
And besides, what if one of you…

40:31.679 --> 40:33.806
What if one of your people talked, huh?

40:33.889 --> 40:36.016
You're throwing a hissy fit here.

40:39.478 --> 40:40.980
Listen, Sangman.

40:41.689 --> 40:43.149
You want to call it off?

40:44.233 --> 40:46.152
You be my guest, fucker.

41:08.841 --> 41:12.761
Agent Choi,
you're gonna have to fix this. Hmm?

41:14.972 --> 41:15.973
Good luck.

41:23.230 --> 41:25.274
What did I say was gonna happen?

41:25.941 --> 41:27.526
I told you it wouldn't work.

41:27.610 --> 41:29.320
Now what are we supposed to do?

41:30.112 --> 41:33.073
<i>We can't keep antagonizing him.</i>
<i>That would be suicide.</i>

41:34.950 --> 41:36.619
We push him to the edge.

41:36.702 --> 41:38.078
He'll fall eventually.

41:38.162 --> 41:40.956
I take it reading people isn't your forte.

41:41.499 --> 41:43.042
Sometimes pushing people works,

41:43.125 --> 41:45.920
but other times it backfires,
and you're screwed.

41:46.504 --> 41:47.713
Mr. Kang.

41:47.796 --> 41:50.674
Jeon can't unload
his entire inventory in two weeks.

41:50.758 --> 41:52.885
It's impossible, according to intel.

41:53.552 --> 41:57.181
It may take a little longer,
but we're sticking with our plan.

42:03.354 --> 42:05.356
I'll call you back. There's someone here.

42:06.690 --> 42:09.318
Hey, what are you doing out here? Huh?

42:10.361 --> 42:11.612
You'll catch a cold.

42:12.530 --> 42:16.075
Hey, are you a member
of the church too, mister?

42:16.158 --> 42:18.577
No, not at all. I'm just a businessman.

42:18.661 --> 42:19.703
I don't believe in God.

42:19.787 --> 42:21.163
You don't?

42:21.664 --> 42:23.457
Save me then. Please?

42:24.583 --> 42:25.876
What are you saying?

42:26.502 --> 42:29.797
I really want to go home,
but my daddy left me.

42:30.381 --> 42:32.341
And my mom only prays now.

42:40.933 --> 42:41.850
Hey!

42:44.853 --> 42:47.398
You know you're not allowed to leave here!

43:11.755 --> 43:15.551
We have to do this. There's no other way
to put Pastor Jeon behind bars.

43:15.634 --> 43:17.344
Didn't I make this clear already?

43:23.976 --> 43:27.980
Yeah.
Is that really the only option available?

43:28.063 --> 43:29.023
Here's the thing.

43:29.106 --> 43:30.774
Why bother with jail?

43:31.358 --> 43:35.738
I mean, wouldn't it be a lot easier
to… to make sure he never gets out?

43:35.821 --> 43:37.072
What are you saying?

43:37.156 --> 43:38.282
<i>What I'm saying</i>

43:38.365 --> 43:40.117
is why not kill him?

43:40.618 --> 43:42.369
Keep it simple. Done.

43:47.416 --> 43:50.377
The NIS can't just order
an assassination like that.

43:52.921 --> 43:54.798
Then what if it were to just happen?

43:54.882 --> 43:57.509
What are you insinuating, Mr. Kang?

43:57.593 --> 44:00.512
Well, there must be multiple ways
to kill someone.

44:01.013 --> 44:02.765
I wouldn't have to do it myself.

44:03.515 --> 44:06.185
Keeping Jeon alive is our top priority.

44:06.268 --> 44:08.062
That's how we punish his crimes.

44:08.145 --> 44:09.355
Ah.

44:10.064 --> 44:13.025
I understand. Your promotion
is riding on this, isn't it?

44:13.108 --> 44:13.942
What?

44:16.987 --> 44:19.615
This has nothing to do
with my career path.

44:20.616 --> 44:23.535
I've spent the last three years of my life
on this whole thing.

44:23.619 --> 44:25.579
And I'm just hoping it'll be a success.

44:26.955 --> 44:29.458
Look, the problems keep piling up.

44:29.541 --> 44:32.503
You honestly believe
this is gonna turn out… Hey.

44:33.003 --> 44:36.256
Look, I'm not so sure anymore.
I've got to trust myself.

44:36.340 --> 44:38.217
I'll call you back later, okay?

44:47.810 --> 44:49.436
We still have
the routes to Europe,

44:49.520 --> 44:53.482
but even using all the church members
to increase exports…

44:53.565 --> 44:56.402
Just being able to move
the rest of the coke…

44:56.485 --> 44:58.404
It'll take more than a year, for sure.

44:59.029 --> 45:01.198
What about the mob families in Europe?

45:01.281 --> 45:03.534
I sent some offers to a few of them,

45:03.617 --> 45:07.413
but really, the Cali Cartel,
they've got their hooks in everything.

45:07.496 --> 45:09.832
<i>So even if we made a deal,</i>

45:09.915 --> 45:11.500
<i>we're gonna have problems with Cali.</i>

45:12.793 --> 45:16.130
<i> I got another call</i>
<i>from Colombia this morning.</i>

45:16.213 --> 45:18.590
<i>They heard about Brazil.</i>

45:19.174 --> 45:20.676
<i>They started asking questions</i>

45:20.759 --> 45:23.011
<i>about what was going to happen</i>
<i>to their money.</i>

45:53.041 --> 45:55.711
There's something else. Another way.

45:56.295 --> 45:57.129
Sir?

45:57.921 --> 45:59.631
What… what kind of way?

46:01.091 --> 46:02.217
A dirty one.

46:04.219 --> 46:05.304
Get the car.

46:20.736 --> 46:25.157
IS PASTOR JEON LOOKING
INTO A DIFFERENT ROUTE?

46:30.078 --> 46:31.789
NEW MESSAGE
SANGMAN

48:05.966 --> 48:08.302
What are you playing at, Pastor?
