Oh, that's good.

09:19.792 --> 09:22.955
What movie do you think
best describes your vagina?

09:23.029 --> 09:24.018
<i>The Color Purple.</i>

09:24.096 --> 09:25.620

09:32.538 --> 09:34.631
Mmm, this yogurt is so good.

09:34.707 --> 09:36.265
Apple turnover is my favorite.

09:36.342 --> 09:38.833
I've got Boston cream pie. It tastes so good.

09:39.111 --> 09:41.545
And the best part is, it keeps me regular.

09:42.048 --> 09:43.845
Well, my yogurt gets to work downstairs, too.

09:43.916 --> 09:45.474
But in the front of the house...

09:45.551 --> 09:46.609
I don't get your meaning.

09:46.686 --> 09:48.449
This new yogurt, Yo-Puss,

09:48.521 --> 09:50.318
makes your pussy taste like nothing.

09:50.389 --> 09:51.981
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

09:52.058 --> 09:53.719
FEMALE NARRATOR:
<i>A woman's intimate area</i>

09:53.793 --> 09:56.921

09:56.996 --> 09:58.088

10:04.170 --> 10:05.797
You mean, if I eat Yo-Puss,

10:05.871 --> 10:08.567
I won't taste like hot summer
Chinatown garbage anymore?

10:08.641 --> 10:10.268
You won't taste like anything anymore.

10:10.343 --> 10:11.674

10:12.144 --> 10:13.634
Here, taste.

10:19.118 --> 10:20.517
Mmm. Mmm-hmm.

10:21.087 --> 10:22.748
- Nothing.
- Right?

10:22.822 --> 10:25.791
I use scented tampons even
when I'm not on my period,

10:25.858 --> 10:27.849
just to chemically strip
my vagina of any scent.

10:28.427 --> 10:30.554
But I still worry it tastes really bad.

10:30.630 --> 10:32.029
It definitely does.

10:32.098 --> 10:35.226
But if you just choke down
three tubs of this per day,

10:35.301 --> 10:37.792
I promise you, in the next
12 to 14 business weeks,

10:38.571 --> 10:39.799
it'll start working.

10:39.972 --> 10:40.961
Mmm.

10:41.173 --> 10:42.800
- Tastes like yogurt, right?
- Mmm.

11:57.149 --> 11:58.980
Thank you, I was so excited
to get your phone call.

11:59.051 --> 12:00.814
- You wrote <i>Hamilton...</i> Right?
- Yeah.

12:00.886 --> 12:02.877

12:07.793 --> 12:09.226
Oh, my God, my sister and I saw it

12:09.295 --> 12:11.126
and we were flipping out.

12:11.197 --> 12:12.186
Thank you so much.

12:12.364 --> 12:13.422
It's been an incredible journey.

12:13.666 --> 12:15.099
But then I thought like...

12:16.569 --> 12:17.627
I could do that.

12:18.404 --> 12:19.837
You know, I thought, how hard is it

12:25.911 --> 12:27.242
to be on your TV show.

12:27.947 --> 12:28.971
Why would you think that?

12:29.448 --> 12:30.881
You sent me a DM on Twitter that said,

12:30.950 --> 12:32.508
"I'd love for you to be on my TV show."

12:32.952 --> 12:34.214

12:36.989 --> 12:38.217
So, okay, I know what you're thinking.

12:38.290 --> 12:39.985

18:21.033 --> 18:22.295
- That's nice.
- I never said no.

18:22.367 --> 18:24.096
Now, sometimes when
I come in to get waxed,

18:24.169 --> 18:25.363
you're wearing a mask.

18:25.437 --> 18:27.564
Should I take...
Should I be offended?

18:27.773 --> 18:29.638
It's probably because of powder sometimes.

18:30.476 --> 18:32.706
- Powder.
- Getting into our nose, ear.

18:33.045 --> 18:34.103
- That's why.
- Right.

18:34.179 --> 18:35.646
It's not because my vagina smells

18:35.714 --> 18:37.545
- like hot summer Chinatown garbage?
- No.

18:37.616 --> 18:39.413
It's nothing, no. No, it's not.

18:39.485 --> 18:41.680
Because I try to like hook it up
before I come in there.

18:42.187 --> 18:44.553
But then you started basically
wearing an Ebola suit

18:44.623 --> 18:45.647
to come in and deal with me.

18:45.724 --> 18:47.919
So I thought, "Is something
going on with me?"

18:48.594 --> 18:50.721
Here's a question, if you
haven't been touched in a while,

18:50.796 --> 18:52.730
which has happened to me
several times over the years,

18:53.065 --> 18:54.623
and then sometimes you feel hot wax,

18:54.766 --> 18:56.495
and your body, like you kind of like get wet.

18:57.069 --> 18:58.229
And you're like, "Oh, my God,

18:58.303 --> 18:59.736
"is Pramela gonna think I'm hitting on her?"

19:00.205 --> 19:02.036
- Does that happen a lot?
- No.

19:03.242 --> 19:04.436
Is not.

19:04.710 --> 19:06.974
Yeah, I know. (CHUCKLES)

19:07.346 --> 19:09.109
Has anyone ever farted
while you waxed them?

19:09.581 --> 19:11.378
- No. (LAUGHS)
- No?

19:12.651 --> 19:14.551
How would you describe my vagina?

19:14.753 --> 19:16.380
I have been seeing you for nine years.

19:16.455 --> 19:17.444
Nine years.

19:17.523 --> 19:18.717
It still look...

19:18.857 --> 19:20.381
- Still looks good?
- Same, fresh and lovely.

19:20.592 --> 19:21.957
I still... I got it, right?

19:22.027 --> 19:23.187
I still got it?

19:23.295 --> 19:25.388
Is my vagina and my asshole,

19:25.464 --> 19:27.455
are they like spaced correctly?

19:27.533 --> 19:29.558
Like are things like typical on me?

19:29.835 --> 19:31.860
Is everyone sort of the same
amount away from each other?

19:32.437 --> 19:34.132
(CHUCKLING) The same, yes.

19:34.206 --> 19:36.106
Does everyone have the same like size taint?

19:36.842 --> 19:38.901
No, everybody have different.

19:38.977 --> 19:40.808
Everyone's different.
So there's no good and bad.

19:40.879 --> 19:41.868
No.

19:41.947 --> 19:43.346
Has anybody ever said, "What's her...

19:44.383 --> 19:46.248
"What's Amy's vagina like?"

19:46.618 --> 19:47.744
- No, no.
- Really?

19:47.819 --> 19:49.013
- I'd want to know.
- (LAUGHING)

19:49.454 --> 19:50.819
Do you have other famous clients?

19:51.356 --> 19:54.291
I had, but she moved to
somewhere else.

19:54.359 --> 19:56.020
- That's why.
- Who could leave you?

19:56.094 --> 19:57.459
- I know...
- You and me for life.

19:57.829 --> 19:59.353
You and me are for life, okay?

19:59.431 --> 20:01.023
I will always be there for you.

20:01.400 --> 20:02.867
And I will always be here for you

20:02.935 --> 20:06.632
unless I'm in some sort of a very strange
bull-riding accident.

20:06.738 --> 20:08.000
(BOTH LAUGHING)

20:10.709 --> 20:12.006
Are you in pain?

20:12.477 --> 20:13.466
(GIGGLES)

20:13.545 --> 20:14.534
(SNIFFLES)

20:15.147 --> 20:16.171
Hey...

20:17.382 --> 20:19.213
(BOTH LAUGHING)

20:20.118 --> 20:21.346
You're a cunt.

20:21.553 --> 20:22.918
Hey, hey.

20:25.524 --> 20:28.823
I use scented tampons
even when I'm not on my period

20:29.428 --> 20:31.623
- to chemically...
- (LAUGHTER)

20:31.997 --> 20:32.986
We're so close.

20:33.065 --> 20:34.726
I'm having trouble with this transish.

20:35.133 --> 20:36.794
- (LAUGHING)
- Um...

20:36.868 --> 20:37.835
Oh, my hair.

20:38.136 --> 20:40.536
Refill. (RETCHING)

20:41.139 --> 20:42.538
My name is Tracy.

20:42.608 --> 20:44.166
(LAUGHTER)

20:44.843 --> 20:45.901
MAN: All right, cut.

20:46.011 --> 20:47.376
WOMAN: <i>So easy.</i>

20:47.446 --> 20:48.708
MAN: <i>Mmm, magic.</i>

20:51.483 --> 20:52.711
(SINGING) <i>Oh</i>

20:54.052 --> 20:55.781
(LAUGHS)

20:56.455 --> 20:58.685
Are you ready to be struck by your sister

20:58.757 --> 20:59.883
in front of your hero?

21:00.459 --> 21:01.585
(WHISPERS)

21:01.927 --> 21:03.588
Do you want to be struck by your sister

21:03.662 --> 21:05.425
in front of your hero?
(LAUGHING)
