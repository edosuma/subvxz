WEBVTT

00:03.204 --> 00:04.572
LINCOLN: Don't you have
a job or something?

00:04.605 --> 00:05.806
SUCRE:
Yeah, on a freelance cargo ship.

00:05.839 --> 00:07.641
We go to Hong Kong,
Spain,

00:07.675 --> 00:09.743
Buenos Aires, basically
wherever the boss tells us.

00:09.777 --> 00:11.379
Corrupt son of a bitch.

00:11.412 --> 00:12.980
LINCOLN: We've awoken something,
something people are trying to

00:13.013 --> 00:14.315
hide about Michael.

00:14.348 --> 00:15.816
Who the hell is
this Poseidon guy?

00:15.849 --> 00:17.185
MICHAEL:
A psychopath.

00:17.218 --> 00:18.919
A frustrated policy wonk

00:18.952 --> 00:21.021
in the CIA
who created a cell

00:21.055 --> 00:24.092
within the CIA called 21-Void.

00:24.125 --> 00:25.693
And they needed my help

00:25.726 --> 00:26.927
breaking out people in prison

00:26.960 --> 00:28.662
all over the world.

00:28.696 --> 00:29.997
Before he was killed,

00:30.030 --> 00:31.732
Kellerman had been
looking into 21-Void.

00:31.765 --> 00:33.601
I need you to look
into the possibility

00:33.634 --> 00:35.403
that there was
an insider involved.

00:35.436 --> 00:37.105
I wasn't expecting
a call at this hour.

00:37.138 --> 00:38.439
I think we need to meet soon.

00:38.472 --> 00:40.208
I was looking for where
the man went.

00:40.241 --> 00:41.375
What man, baby?

00:41.409 --> 00:42.576
The man that
gave me this.

00:42.610 --> 00:43.744
Michael.

00:43.777 --> 00:46.080
What are you into?

00:46.114 --> 00:47.581
Just tell us
where you're headed.

00:47.615 --> 00:50.050
300 miles across
the desert, Phaeacia.

00:50.084 --> 00:52.019
Autonomous zone. No ISIL.

00:52.052 --> 00:53.354
I can lead you there.

00:53.387 --> 00:54.822
WHIP: Phaeacia, we found it!
(children yelling)

00:59.560 --> 01:00.561
(Michael yells)

01:03.497 --> 01:04.965
(screams)

01:08.136 --> 01:11.905
CYCLOPS: Back in the city,
I told you you would die.

01:11.939 --> 01:12.940
LINCOLN:
Michael.

01:12.973 --> 01:14.608
(whispering):
He poisoned me.

01:38.532 --> 01:42.102
It's incredible how good
you've gotten at drawing, Mike.

01:42.136 --> 01:44.738
Really, that's...

01:44.772 --> 01:46.674
that's so good.

01:46.707 --> 01:49.076
It's a Greek hero.

01:49.109 --> 01:50.811
He looks hurt.

01:50.844 --> 01:53.247
They all get hurt
sooner or later.

01:53.281 --> 01:56.016
That's what's great
about Greek heroes,

01:56.049 --> 01:59.119
they're real, not supermen.

01:59.153 --> 02:01.088
They get hurt.

02:01.121 --> 02:02.356
They can die.

02:11.865 --> 02:13.967
Hey, I'm sorry, buddy,
last little bit.

02:14.001 --> 02:16.003
I got to keep it
clean, you know?

02:16.036 --> 02:17.671
It's looking much
better though, okay?

02:17.705 --> 02:19.507
You're doing good.
You just hang in there, buddy.

02:20.408 --> 02:21.642
How we doing?

02:21.675 --> 02:23.344
Got something.

02:23.377 --> 02:25.379
Our friend over
there has a boat.

02:25.413 --> 02:27.281
He's making a smuggling
run to Greece.

02:27.315 --> 02:30.318
He says he can take your brother
to a first world doctor.

02:30.351 --> 02:32.453
First world thinks
he's Kaniel Outis.

02:32.486 --> 02:33.987
They'll arrest him on sight.

02:34.021 --> 02:35.489
So?

02:35.523 --> 02:36.724
What's the alternative,
let him die?

02:36.757 --> 02:38.025
What kind of a brother are you?

02:40.828 --> 02:42.062
You say something
like that again,

02:42.095 --> 02:43.697
I swear to God,
I'll kill you.

02:50.704 --> 02:52.373
There might be a third option.

03:01.249 --> 03:03.417
SARA: So how was
your first day back?

03:03.451 --> 03:05.018
(sighs)

03:05.052 --> 03:07.421
I have to say, it's
never been so rewarding

03:07.455 --> 03:08.756
to teach game theory to the tops

03:08.789 --> 03:10.224
of a bunch of
18-year-olds' heads

03:10.258 --> 03:11.759
while they're busy
sexting each other.

03:11.792 --> 03:13.026
Ew.

03:13.060 --> 03:14.328
(laughing):
Ew!

03:14.362 --> 03:15.763
But...

03:15.796 --> 03:18.399
normalcy's threatening
to come back,

03:18.432 --> 03:20.568
and I say
cheers to that.

03:20.601 --> 03:21.902
Cheers to that.

03:21.935 --> 03:23.704
(ring clinks on glass)

03:23.737 --> 03:25.239
Come on,
let's sit outside.

03:25.273 --> 03:27.007
(phone ringing)

03:27.040 --> 03:28.542
I'll be right there.

03:34.047 --> 03:35.383
Hello?

03:35.416 --> 03:37.518
LINCOLN:
We found Michael.

03:37.551 --> 03:39.953
Is he our Michael?

03:39.987 --> 03:41.689
Yes, Sara.

03:41.722 --> 03:43.791
(soft chuckle)

03:43.824 --> 03:46.694
Sara, listen,
he's been poisoned.

03:46.727 --> 03:47.928
We think it's antifreeze.

03:47.961 --> 03:49.196
He's lost a lot of blood.

03:49.229 --> 03:51.532
He needs a lot of blood.

03:51.565 --> 03:53.033
Okay.

03:53.066 --> 03:54.568
He needs a lot of things
if it's antifreeze.

03:54.602 --> 03:55.803
Listen, uh,

03:55.836 --> 03:57.571
we're heading to Greece.

03:57.605 --> 03:59.807
Is there any way we can get some
medical help off the books?

03:59.840 --> 04:01.542
No, no, no, no, no,
this isn't the kind of thing

04:01.575 --> 04:03.043
that you want to do
off the books.

04:03.076 --> 04:06.146
Listen, Lincoln, he's
gonna need a transfusion.

04:06.179 --> 04:07.948
Michael's B negative, okay?

04:07.981 --> 04:10.984
It's maybe one percent of the
population with that blood type.

04:11.018 --> 04:12.753
You won't find it
where you're going,

04:12.786 --> 04:14.622
and he won't make it
while you look.

04:16.957 --> 04:20.093
Unless it comes to you.

04:20.127 --> 04:21.362
I'll call you back.

04:23.196 --> 04:25.399
Hey, what's going on?

04:25.433 --> 04:27.000
I, uh...

04:27.034 --> 04:28.902
I got to go.

04:28.936 --> 04:30.938
You got to go?

04:30.971 --> 04:32.306
(both chuckle)
Go where?

04:32.340 --> 04:33.607
To Crete.

04:34.842 --> 04:36.243
Michael, um,

04:36.276 --> 04:37.911
they found him.

04:37.945 --> 04:39.313
He's alive.

04:39.347 --> 04:40.581
He's poisoned.

04:40.614 --> 04:42.983
Michael? Your ex, Michael?

04:43.016 --> 04:44.251
Yeah.

04:44.284 --> 04:45.486
Wait, hold on a second,

04:45.519 --> 04:47.855
he really is alive?

04:47.888 --> 04:49.457
He contacted you just now?

04:49.490 --> 04:52.926
Yeah, and, uh,
and he needs help,

04:52.960 --> 04:56.964
and I think I'm the only one
that can help him.

04:56.997 --> 04:59.032
Um...

04:59.066 --> 05:01.769
yeah, I can get there faster on
a plane than they can on a boat.

05:01.802 --> 05:04.372
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Sara?

05:04.405 --> 05:06.306
Y-You don't owe him that.

05:06.340 --> 05:08.342
Y-You don't know what you'd be
walking into; it's not safe.

05:08.376 --> 05:09.710
I'll be fine.
I don't have a choice.

05:09.743 --> 05:10.978
(stammering):
I...

05:11.011 --> 05:12.580
This has been a hell of a week.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.150
Okay, look, I know you've
got a million questions,

05:17.184 --> 05:19.052
just like I do, okay?

05:19.086 --> 05:21.622
I can't look
my son in the eye

05:21.655 --> 05:23.691
and tell him that
I let his father die

05:23.724 --> 05:25.993
when I could've
tried to save him.

05:26.026 --> 05:27.361
A father he's never met.

05:27.395 --> 05:29.963
I can't do that.

05:29.997 --> 05:31.765
And if I told you not to go?

05:35.569 --> 05:37.204
"If's" a big word
in that sentence.

05:37.237 --> 05:39.172
Jacob, are you telling me
not to go?

05:42.610 --> 05:44.177
No.

05:44.211 --> 05:46.179
No, of course not.

05:46.213 --> 05:48.048
Okay.

05:53.587 --> 05:56.524
(laughing)

05:59.359 --> 06:01.895
Should've left her
out of this, Linc.

06:01.929 --> 06:04.364
Shut up. You're about to see
the wife you haven't seen

06:04.398 --> 06:05.933
in seven years.

06:08.035 --> 06:09.903
I got you, I got you.
JA:
Cast off.

06:09.937 --> 06:11.739
You're ready.

06:11.772 --> 06:13.607
What do you mean?

06:15.743 --> 06:19.513
Been locked up for longer
than I can remember.

06:19.547 --> 06:21.381
Before Ogygia, it was
my apartment, my head

06:21.415 --> 06:23.451
and my phone.

06:23.484 --> 06:24.952
Walls all around me.

06:24.985 --> 06:28.221
Couldn't see the world.

06:28.255 --> 06:30.791
(children laughing and
speaking foreign language)

06:30.824 --> 06:32.392
I like it here.

06:32.426 --> 06:33.794
No walls.

06:33.827 --> 06:37.397
Freedom, like I haven't
had in a long time.

06:37.431 --> 06:40.067
I can start over.

06:40.100 --> 06:43.103
And unless you say you need me,

06:43.136 --> 06:45.072
I'd like to stay.

06:45.105 --> 06:47.608
You're a free man, Ja.

06:47.641 --> 06:49.477
The choice is yours.

06:50.744 --> 06:53.614
I owe you my life.

06:53.647 --> 06:55.816
You gave me back the world.

06:59.119 --> 07:00.954
Get him healthy. Get safe.

07:00.988 --> 07:02.990
Yeah, I will.

07:03.023 --> 07:04.692
See you.

07:08.428 --> 07:09.630
Hey, hey, hey.

07:09.663 --> 07:11.131
I got to know,

07:11.164 --> 07:14.502
you really got
Freddie Mercury's ashes?

07:14.535 --> 07:18.305
Is it true Keith Richard
snorted his dead father's ashes?

07:18.338 --> 07:19.673
I don't know.

07:20.941 --> 07:23.143
Exactly.

07:23.176 --> 07:24.945
Keep alive.

07:24.978 --> 07:27.114
You too, man.

07:27.147 --> 07:29.282
(boat engine starts)

07:35.355 --> 07:37.758
Linc,

07:37.791 --> 07:39.593
how far is it to Greece?

07:39.627 --> 07:41.662
12 hours.

07:41.695 --> 07:43.296
Sara's gonna be there in 12.

07:43.330 --> 07:46.934
I don't think I have
12 hours in me.

07:46.967 --> 07:48.969
(coughing and retching)

07:51.539 --> 07:53.541
*

08:25.172 --> 08:26.707
*

08:56.737 --> 08:58.739
*

09:04.211 --> 09:08.048
VAN GOGH:
I was right, we got problems.

09:08.081 --> 09:12.119
Apparently, State Department is
asking questions about 21-Void

09:12.152 --> 09:14.554
after our visit
to NSA yesterday.

09:14.588 --> 09:16.289
They have no
viable information.

09:17.490 --> 09:19.559
21-Void doesn't exist.

09:19.593 --> 09:21.028
Poseidon will clean house.

09:21.061 --> 09:23.196
The problem's
not going away.

09:23.230 --> 09:24.397
That State Department
agent wants to meet

09:24.431 --> 09:25.799
as soon as we land.

09:36.576 --> 09:38.879
Chania, please?

09:38.912 --> 09:40.147
Thank you.

09:40.180 --> 09:43.250
(phone vibrates)

09:55.595 --> 09:57.330
It is safe here.

09:57.364 --> 09:58.999
I use when I come.

09:59.032 --> 10:02.569
LINCOLN:
You got any food for him?

10:02.602 --> 10:03.804
Come, it's in the boat.

10:03.837 --> 10:06.406
Great, thank you.

10:06.439 --> 10:08.108
Keep his spirits up.

10:08.141 --> 10:11.011
All right, man.

10:14.047 --> 10:17.350
Oh, man.

10:21.121 --> 10:22.823
Got to hang in there,
buddy, huh?

10:25.659 --> 10:29.496
Still got a lot of things
to tell me, you know?

10:32.565 --> 10:34.501
You gonna tell me why
I'm your whip hand.

10:34.534 --> 10:36.536
Remember?

10:43.877 --> 10:45.545
I got a lot invested in you.

10:48.515 --> 10:51.151
You can't die on me now,
Michael, you know?

10:52.652 --> 10:55.455
Called you Michael.
(chuckles softly)

10:55.488 --> 11:00.060
The first-- first time I ever
really known your name,

11:00.093 --> 11:02.529
even though I feel like...

11:04.531 --> 11:07.200
I feel like we've been brothers
since we met, you know?

11:13.073 --> 11:15.208
You know, with--
with Linc here...

11:17.244 --> 11:19.012
(sighs)

11:19.046 --> 11:22.015
...it was the first time I ever
felt like an outsider with you.

11:22.049 --> 11:24.217
You know, like--

11:24.251 --> 11:27.054
like I lost...

11:27.087 --> 11:28.989
part of my family
or something.

11:29.022 --> 11:32.960
So, you see, Michael,
you can't die.

11:37.230 --> 11:39.399
Please?

11:52.579 --> 11:55.048
(motor whirring)

12:04.091 --> 12:06.760
(motor sputtering)

12:26.113 --> 12:27.247
(gasps)

12:30.517 --> 12:33.320
Linc.

12:41.929 --> 12:44.531
(door closes)

12:55.943 --> 12:57.911
(sighs)

12:57.945 --> 12:59.412
Hi.

12:59.446 --> 13:01.548
I missed you.

13:10.991 --> 13:13.760
I'm gonna fix you up.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.795
And then
we'll talk, okay?

13:18.231 --> 13:20.500
I'm gonna make you okay.

13:22.735 --> 13:24.604
(gasps)
No.

13:24.637 --> 13:25.672
Shh, shh, shh,

13:25.705 --> 13:27.841
shh, shh, shh,
it's okay.

13:29.176 --> 13:31.144
Hey, Lincoln, uh,

13:31.178 --> 13:33.146
would you pass me
that coat rack?

13:33.180 --> 13:35.182
Could I grab the chair, please?
Yeah.

13:35.215 --> 13:36.884
(zipper opens)

13:36.917 --> 13:38.351
Thanks.

13:44.724 --> 13:46.426
(gasps)

13:48.195 --> 13:50.163
(breathing shakily)

13:59.272 --> 14:01.241
We'll do a transfusion.

14:05.778 --> 14:07.047
I'm O negative.

14:07.080 --> 14:09.682
It's the universal donor.

14:09.716 --> 14:12.519
Turns out it's the only other
blood type I could've given him.

14:12.552 --> 14:15.155
(sighs)

14:15.188 --> 14:17.190
Maybe there's something
to destiny, huh?

14:17.224 --> 14:19.226
(quiet, rasping breaths)

14:21.294 --> 14:24.331
Is he gonna live?

14:24.364 --> 14:27.000
Yeah.
(sniffs)

14:27.034 --> 14:29.336
Yeah, he'll live.

14:29.369 --> 14:31.939
Give him
a couple hours.

14:31.972 --> 14:34.407
He's strong.
(laughs)

14:34.441 --> 14:35.708
(sniffles)

14:37.710 --> 14:40.914
We'll, uh... we'll
give you a minute.

14:40.948 --> 14:42.849
Yeah.

14:42.882 --> 14:46.053
I'm right here.

14:46.086 --> 14:47.720
I'm right here.

14:52.892 --> 14:55.295
We need to work out a way
to get off this island.

15:02.102 --> 15:04.704
What I said...

15:04.737 --> 15:08.408
um, about you--

15:08.441 --> 15:10.610
I was wrong.

15:14.581 --> 15:15.983
A man would be lucky
to have a brother

15:16.016 --> 15:17.917
cares as much
as you, you know?

15:19.919 --> 15:21.688
Wife like that...

15:23.656 --> 15:25.625
...family.

15:28.795 --> 15:30.897
I wouldn't call it luck.

15:30.930 --> 15:33.600
You've been through
what we've been through.

15:33.633 --> 15:35.302
You're family now.

15:38.972 --> 15:40.340
I'll drink to that.

15:40.373 --> 15:42.809
Yeah.

15:42.842 --> 15:44.177
(groans)

15:44.211 --> 15:45.778
Flying's really
out of the question?

15:45.812 --> 15:46.980
Yeah.

15:47.014 --> 15:50.917
Airports are worse
than hospitals.

15:50.950 --> 15:53.920
And once the name Kaniel Outis
is radioactive,

15:53.953 --> 15:55.888
they'll shoot him on sight.

15:57.324 --> 15:59.659
So another boat?

15:59.692 --> 16:01.694
(clears throat)
Across the Atlantic?

16:01.728 --> 16:06.933
Mm, I'm no sailor, but I know
that no boat in that harbor

16:06.966 --> 16:09.369
is gonna get us that far.

16:09.402 --> 16:10.837
We need a big boat.

16:12.672 --> 16:16.909
One that doesn't mind a
radioactive cargo, you know?

16:31.424 --> 16:35.162
KISHIDA: Hey there. I wanted to
follow up on our conversation.

16:35.195 --> 16:36.963
Obviously, the CIA and State,

16:36.996 --> 16:38.898
we've been sharing
information on Kaniel Outis,

16:38.931 --> 16:41.134
but my question for you is:

16:41.168 --> 16:42.869
Outis killed Abu Ramal,

16:42.902 --> 16:45.238
did the country
a service.

16:45.272 --> 16:47.874
So why were you
still at NSA yesterday,

16:47.907 --> 16:49.976
trying to kill him?

16:50.009 --> 16:52.011
Why don't we get
off the tarmac?

16:52.045 --> 16:54.181
We'll share what we can
about our investigation.

16:55.682 --> 16:58.385
This is all just
bureaucratic miscommunication.

16:58.418 --> 17:00.653
We can iron it out.

17:00.687 --> 17:03.022
So you know, we
checked with CIA.

17:03.056 --> 17:06.326
The CIA didn't sanction
your visit to NSA yesterday.

17:06.358 --> 17:08.095
No one even knew
you were there.

17:08.127 --> 17:10.696
Who are you working
for, really?

17:10.730 --> 17:13.031
And why were you trying to
take out Kaniel Outis?

17:21.808 --> 17:24.243
Never thought
I'd see this face again.

17:24.277 --> 17:26.613
You weren't supposed to.

17:28.315 --> 17:30.083
Why?

17:32.119 --> 17:35.555
I'll tell you everything
you want to know.

17:35.588 --> 17:38.024
But first,
I need something from you.

17:38.057 --> 17:39.759
Anything.

17:41.494 --> 17:44.297
A picture of my son.

17:46.466 --> 17:48.201
A&W: We weren't
at NSA yesterday.

17:48.235 --> 17:51.238
I'm telling you,
this is a mistake.

17:51.271 --> 17:53.306
And it's a mistake
to lie to me.

17:53.340 --> 17:55.108
I can have you
prosecuted.

17:55.142 --> 17:59.078
I have a contact at the NSA
and she gave me proof.

17:59.112 --> 18:01.781
You're not calling
him Junior, are you?

18:01.814 --> 18:04.817
(laughs) I promised you
I would never do that.

18:06.953 --> 18:08.788
He's an amazing kid.

18:09.656 --> 18:11.358
He's just like you.

18:20.333 --> 18:21.968
What's wrong?

18:26.673 --> 18:29.108
(shell casing tinkles on floor)

18:34.214 --> 18:35.648
It's him.

18:41.388 --> 18:43.623
Your husband.

18:43.656 --> 18:45.758
Jacob?

18:45.792 --> 18:47.894
Jacob.

18:55.335 --> 18:57.504
Jacob is Poseidon.

19:05.545 --> 19:07.714
I knew it. I wasn't crazy.

19:07.747 --> 19:11.218
I caught him lying, but he-he--

19:11.251 --> 19:12.885
oh, God, he covered it so well.

19:12.919 --> 19:15.888
He was... honest and hurt,

19:15.922 --> 19:17.557
and I bought it.

19:17.590 --> 19:18.991
Who is he?

19:19.025 --> 19:20.827
Really?

19:20.860 --> 19:24.331
He's a CIA operative,
deep cover.

19:24.364 --> 19:26.566
He runs a splinter
cell called 21-Void.

19:26.599 --> 19:28.968
What does this have to do
with you?

19:29.001 --> 19:31.571
He targeted me
for my skills,

19:31.604 --> 19:33.206
blackmailed me.

19:33.240 --> 19:35.642
He told me if I didn't agree
to come work for him,

19:35.675 --> 19:37.477
he'd go after you and Linc,

19:37.510 --> 19:39.979
put you both in jail.

19:40.012 --> 19:41.848
And then he
proved it to me.

19:44.183 --> 19:46.586
He said I could never see
either one of you again.

19:46.619 --> 19:49.322
Or Mike.

19:49.356 --> 19:51.358
Made me fake my death.

19:51.391 --> 19:53.926
And then he just used me.

19:53.960 --> 19:55.562
He married me.

19:55.595 --> 19:57.330
If I'd known he was your
husband, I swear...

19:57.364 --> 19:58.431
No, no, no, no, no,

19:58.465 --> 20:00.500
this is not on you.

20:00.533 --> 20:02.435
I...

20:04.437 --> 20:06.673
Why now?
Why did you come back now?

20:06.706 --> 20:08.708
The origami...

20:10.643 --> 20:13.280
Four years ago,
he betrayed me

20:13.313 --> 20:16.048
and now I know why.

20:16.082 --> 20:19.452
He wanted me out
of the way...

20:19.486 --> 20:21.120
so he could have you.

20:22.154 --> 20:24.591
How did he betray you?

20:24.624 --> 20:26.859
He set a meeting.

20:26.893 --> 20:29.762
We were supposed to discuss
my next assignment.

20:29.796 --> 20:32.465
What he didn't tell me was that

20:32.499 --> 20:33.866
we were meeting a man
named Harlan Gaines,

20:33.900 --> 20:36.903
a deputy director of the CIA.

20:36.936 --> 20:39.105
Gaines was investigating
21-Void.

20:39.138 --> 20:41.374
Looking for the traitor
behind it.

20:41.408 --> 20:45.478
That's when I knew my work
wasn't sanctioned by the CIA.

20:45.512 --> 20:48.648
Poseidon shot and killed Gaines
that night,

20:48.681 --> 20:50.583
to stop the investigation.

20:54.321 --> 20:55.788
He told me to move the body,

20:55.822 --> 20:58.124
make it look like
it never happened.

20:58.157 --> 21:00.460
I've seen the photos
of that part, they're damning.

21:00.493 --> 21:03.229
MICHAEL: He chose images that
showed me moving Gaines' body,

21:03.262 --> 21:06.299
eliminated the ones
that incriminated himself.

21:06.333 --> 21:09.436
I knew I was being set up.

21:09.469 --> 21:11.338
He was tightening his control
over me,

21:11.371 --> 21:14.774
but there was nothing
I could do.

21:14.807 --> 21:17.744
At least,
that's what he thought.

21:17.777 --> 21:20.513
When I knew
Poseidon had gone rogue

21:20.547 --> 21:22.982
and was operating
outside the CIA,

21:23.015 --> 21:25.485
that's when I started my plan
to get back to you.

21:25.518 --> 21:28.154
You're not.

21:28.187 --> 21:29.756
Some other man has your--

21:29.789 --> 21:31.591
your face, your past,
your whole life.

21:31.624 --> 21:34.327
Sara, there is a plan
to make this right,

21:34.361 --> 21:36.963
to protect our family.

21:39.298 --> 21:41.968
Michael, he's with our son
right now.

21:42.001 --> 21:45.271
He's with Mike.

21:45.304 --> 21:48.040
I, uh, look, I have to go.

21:50.743 --> 21:51.944
Ah.

21:51.978 --> 21:53.713
Hey, Noah, you gonna
build us a boat?

21:53.746 --> 21:57.517
Nope. I'm gonna do one better.

21:57.550 --> 21:58.985
Who you calling?

22:00.319 --> 22:03.322
A friend who
actually has a boat.

22:07.694 --> 22:09.696
(cell phone ringing)

22:11.898 --> 22:13.366
Hello?

22:13.400 --> 22:14.667
Sucre, it's me.

22:14.701 --> 22:16.569
Linc?
I thought the Middle East

22:16.603 --> 22:17.970
was gonna swallow you up, man.

22:18.004 --> 22:20.740
Where's Michael?
Did you find him?

22:20.773 --> 22:22.875
Listen, that's why I'm calling.

22:22.909 --> 22:24.577
We're on the island of Crete.

22:24.611 --> 22:26.479
We need a low profile ride
back to the States.

22:26.513 --> 22:28.180
I would love to help,

22:28.214 --> 22:29.982
but we're on the other side
of the world, brother.

22:30.016 --> 22:31.684
We just dropped a load
in Morocco.

22:31.718 --> 22:34.086
What are you talking about?
Morocco's near Crete.

22:34.120 --> 22:37.056
(laughing):
Yeah, I know, of course it is,

22:37.089 --> 22:39.191
but what I mean is
it's not my ship.

22:39.225 --> 22:42.028
Yeah, but what would it
cost to hitch a ride?

22:42.061 --> 22:43.730
You can't hitch a ride.

22:43.763 --> 22:45.565
You have to rent
the whole ship.

22:45.598 --> 22:48.000
The boss charges 50K a leg,
Linc.

22:48.034 --> 22:50.169
You want to get back
to the States, it's 50K.

22:50.202 --> 22:51.404
50K?

22:51.438 --> 22:53.706
We're just trying
to get home.

22:53.740 --> 22:55.608
You know we don't have
that kind of cash.

22:57.376 --> 22:58.611
You do now.

23:00.046 --> 23:01.514
Here, this was
my grandmother's.

23:01.548 --> 23:02.749
It's an heirloom
worth at least that.

23:07.253 --> 23:09.388
I can't think
of a better use for it.

23:10.423 --> 23:12.258
Thank you.

23:12.291 --> 23:16.328
We got it, Sucre.
Get to Crete.

23:18.330 --> 23:20.132
MICHAEL:
He's not gonna hurt Mike,

23:20.166 --> 23:23.202
not unless he suspects
you know who he really is.

23:23.235 --> 23:24.637
If you remove his mask,

23:24.671 --> 23:26.372
he'll lash out.

23:26.405 --> 23:28.207
You know him
better than I do.

23:28.240 --> 23:29.909
That's the point,
no one knows him.

23:29.942 --> 23:31.744
So, what do I do?

23:31.778 --> 23:34.380
You play his game.
You wear your own mask.

23:34.413 --> 23:37.316
As soon as you get a chance
to get away with Mike,

23:37.349 --> 23:41.053
you take it, disappear.

23:41.087 --> 23:43.222
I'll get to the States
as soon as I can.

23:43.255 --> 23:45.892
I'll find you.

23:45.925 --> 23:47.660
You're looking better.

23:47.694 --> 23:49.596
A little grayer, but better.

23:49.629 --> 23:52.465
I have an amazing doctor
on call.

23:59.438 --> 24:02.308
(sighs)
I will wear the mask.

24:02.341 --> 24:04.844
I will play his game...

24:04.877 --> 24:08.447
and if he hurts our son,
I'll kill him.

24:11.450 --> 24:12.852
I can't...

24:30.069 --> 24:32.572
Please come back to us.

24:50.489 --> 24:52.391
JACOB:
She's leaving Crete alone,

24:52.424 --> 24:55.662
which means she left Outis
behind, and he'll try to follow,

24:55.695 --> 24:57.797
return to the U.S.
in the next day or two.

24:57.830 --> 25:00.533
It can only be by ship
or plane, so plaster his face

25:00.567 --> 25:02.334
on all maritime
and air channels,

25:02.368 --> 25:04.336
focusing on all vessels
departing from Crete

25:04.370 --> 25:05.371
in the next 48 hours.

25:05.404 --> 25:07.239
He's got to be on one.

25:07.273 --> 25:09.408
He can't make it back
inside the country.
MIKE: Jacob?

25:10.509 --> 25:12.378
Was that Mommy?

25:14.914 --> 25:19.018
Yes. Mommy's on her way home.

25:30.529 --> 25:32.531
SUCRE:
Michael Scofield.

25:32.565 --> 25:33.900
(laughs)

25:33.933 --> 25:36.502
My man, you got more lives
than anyone.

25:36.535 --> 25:37.770
(laughs)

25:37.804 --> 25:39.271
Think I might've
used them all up.

25:40.272 --> 25:41.841
SUCRE:
A damn phoenix.

25:41.874 --> 25:43.442
I can't believe it.

25:43.475 --> 25:45.077
I want to hear every damn thing

25:45.111 --> 25:46.879
that's happened to you
since you died.

25:46.913 --> 25:48.414
Papi, you're alive?

25:48.447 --> 25:51.684
(laughs)

25:51.718 --> 25:53.219
The skipper
is a corrupt bastard.

25:53.252 --> 25:54.787
Don't mess with him.
He's got guns in the hold,

25:54.821 --> 25:57.624
all kinds of contraband.
Captain.

26:00.059 --> 26:01.861
SUCRE: Here's the cargo
I was telling you about.

26:01.894 --> 26:03.696
CAPTAIN:
Pay up.

26:03.730 --> 26:05.898
Where's the 50K?

26:05.932 --> 26:07.634
Here.

26:07.667 --> 26:10.569
I said cash.

26:10.603 --> 26:12.905
MICHAEL: It's a sapphire,
six carats,

26:12.939 --> 26:16.542
flawless, surrounded by
2.5 carats of bezeled diamonds.

26:16.575 --> 26:18.544
Street value is 125K.

26:18.577 --> 26:22.782
You can pawn it for half that
and still make a profit.

26:31.257 --> 26:32.324
CAPTAIN:
If it's fake,

26:32.358 --> 26:34.794
you go under the sea.

26:37.429 --> 26:40.399
A boat is the last place I
expected to find you, buddy.

26:40.432 --> 26:41.934
I thought you
hated the water.

26:41.968 --> 26:45.171
Yeah, you remember,
but I got a record.

26:45.204 --> 26:47.840
Not a lot of employers lined up
to take a chance on me.

26:47.874 --> 26:50.276
Besides, this ship
provides opportunities

26:50.309 --> 26:52.011
for my side business...

26:52.044 --> 26:54.080
(whispering): ...which is the
real reason I'm on this boat.

26:54.113 --> 26:55.982
This baby...
(knocks on container)

26:56.015 --> 26:58.184
...houses my entire
life savings.

26:58.217 --> 27:00.586
I'm telling you,
it's gonna be huge.

27:00.619 --> 27:03.255
I'm a few months away from
putting all this behind me.

27:03.289 --> 27:05.524
If you guys are lucky,
I'll let you guys

27:05.557 --> 27:07.894
take one of my ladies
for a spin.

27:10.462 --> 27:11.731
Huh?

27:12.799 --> 27:14.801
What, sex dolls?

27:14.834 --> 27:16.102
No, have some class, man.

27:16.135 --> 27:17.837
The term is inflatables,
high quality,

27:17.870 --> 27:19.471
expensive, very lifelike.

27:21.640 --> 27:24.076
Huh?

27:41.660 --> 27:42.862
Hey, honey.

27:42.895 --> 27:44.897
Hey, you.

27:52.671 --> 27:54.673
Mm.

27:57.676 --> 27:59.678
Mm.

28:00.947 --> 28:02.214
Where's Mike?

28:02.248 --> 28:04.650
Asleep.

28:04.683 --> 28:05.684
Kid had a big day.

28:05.718 --> 28:07.253
Oh.

28:07.286 --> 28:09.488
Most important, though,

28:09.521 --> 28:11.057
how's Michael?

28:11.090 --> 28:13.225
Were you able to help him?

28:13.259 --> 28:17.663
I mean, he was barely alive
when I got there.

28:17.696 --> 28:21.400
He, uh, slept most of the time.

28:21.433 --> 28:23.369
I-I did what I could
for him. I, uh...

28:23.402 --> 28:27.339
I stabilized him,
but he's changed.

28:27.373 --> 28:31.677
He, uh... he's just
not the guy I knew.

28:31.710 --> 28:34.513
Hmm.
So, they dropped me at the
airport and that was that.

28:34.546 --> 28:36.582
They?

28:36.615 --> 28:38.617
Linc and some other guy.

28:46.058 --> 28:48.260
Mike?

28:50.763 --> 28:52.431
Where's Mike?

28:52.464 --> 28:54.200
You said that
he was asleep.
He is...

28:54.233 --> 28:56.702
at a friend's house,
a sleepover.

28:56.735 --> 28:59.471
(laughing):
Okay. Which friend?

28:59.505 --> 29:00.739
He's at Patrick's house.

29:04.576 --> 29:06.512
What happened
to your grandmother's ring?

29:07.746 --> 29:10.216
I'm such an idiot.

29:10.249 --> 29:12.051
I took it off on the way over
for safekeeping,

29:12.084 --> 29:14.086
'cause I didn't want it
to get stolen,

29:14.120 --> 29:17.623
then when I looked for it
on the way back it was gone.

29:17.656 --> 29:21.460
Screamed so loud they nearly
threw me off the flight.

29:21.493 --> 29:24.330
Hmm.

29:31.770 --> 29:33.672
(fax machine whirring)

29:49.055 --> 29:51.323
(phone ringing)

29:51.357 --> 29:52.825
JACOB:
Yeah?

29:52.859 --> 29:55.327
VAN GOGH: We spoke to our man
at the Pentagon.

29:55.361 --> 29:56.929
A naval alert just went out.

29:56.963 --> 29:59.098
Kaniel Outis has been located

29:59.131 --> 30:01.667
on a cargo ship
in the Mediterranean.

30:01.700 --> 30:03.669
It was reported
by the ship's captain.

30:03.702 --> 30:05.304
What's the navy
gonna do about it?

30:05.337 --> 30:07.373
The nearest LCS combat craft

30:07.406 --> 30:09.208
is moving to engage.

30:09.241 --> 30:10.776
SEAL team's been deployed.

30:10.809 --> 30:12.444
Orders?

30:12.478 --> 30:15.848
To seek and destroy
Kaniel Outis.

30:15.882 --> 30:17.349
Good.

30:17.383 --> 30:19.118
We've done our job
getting the message out.

30:19.151 --> 30:22.121
Now it's time for the SEALs
to do theirs.

30:22.154 --> 30:24.857
My God.

30:26.192 --> 30:28.227
You've been through hell,
my friend.

30:31.497 --> 30:33.232
Have some faith, papi.

30:33.265 --> 30:35.667
Thanks, papi.

30:37.269 --> 30:38.204
What about you, Linc?

30:39.771 --> 30:41.707
I think Linc's got
a secret girlfriend,

30:41.740 --> 30:43.709
the pilot lady.

30:43.742 --> 30:45.177
She's not my lady.

30:45.211 --> 30:47.646
Maybe Sucre will set you up
with one of his sex dolls.

30:47.679 --> 30:48.981
They're not dolls, man.

30:49.015 --> 30:50.582
Oh, sorry, inflatables.

30:50.616 --> 30:52.318
Look, let's just
change the subject, please.

30:52.351 --> 30:55.021
You know, might be something
to be said for settling down.

30:55.054 --> 30:58.424
Right, well...
that's not in the cards.

30:58.457 --> 31:00.459
(door clangs)

31:04.863 --> 31:06.832
It's locked from the outside.

31:06.865 --> 31:07.934
They made you.

31:07.967 --> 31:10.002
You really are
a wanted terrorist.

31:10.036 --> 31:11.170
What did the hell
did you think he was saying?

31:11.203 --> 31:12.104
I thought it was an analogy.

31:12.138 --> 31:13.405
Oh, for God's sake.

31:13.439 --> 31:14.773
LINCOLN:
There's no other way

31:14.806 --> 31:16.875
out of this cabin.

31:17.876 --> 31:20.779
(helicopter whirring)

31:20.812 --> 31:25.451
MAN: All crew to the top deck.
All hands up.

31:25.484 --> 31:28.020
Comply or be fired on.

31:28.054 --> 31:31.790
This ship is now under
the control of the U.S. Navy.

31:31.823 --> 31:32.758
Prepared to be boarded.

31:32.791 --> 31:34.393
SUCRE:
We got company.

31:34.426 --> 31:35.627
I say we jump.

31:35.661 --> 31:36.862
That's a long way down.

31:36.895 --> 31:38.064
It's the only way out.

31:38.097 --> 31:39.065
It's too far.

31:39.098 --> 31:40.499
I have an idea...

31:42.401 --> 31:45.071
...but it's gonna hurt.

31:53.012 --> 31:55.414
(ringing)

32:03.489 --> 32:05.457
Hello?

32:05.491 --> 32:07.293
(whispering): Hey, Heather,
it's me. Listen, I can't talk,

32:07.326 --> 32:09.495
but I need you to go pick up
Mike right now, okay?

32:09.528 --> 32:10.929
Do you know where
Patrick Monroe lives?

32:10.963 --> 32:11.930
Yeah.

32:11.964 --> 32:13.132
Okay.

32:13.165 --> 32:14.633
Listen, I'll explain later.

32:14.666 --> 32:16.568
Don't bring him back here, okay?

32:16.602 --> 32:18.637
Keep him with you.
I'll be over as soon as I can.

32:18.670 --> 32:20.072
Can you do that for me?

32:20.106 --> 32:22.241
Uh, yeah.
Uh, I'll leave right now.

32:22.274 --> 32:23.642
I-I-Is everything okay?

32:23.675 --> 32:24.610
No.

32:31.950 --> 32:33.119
(grunting)

32:33.152 --> 32:34.353
Go.

32:36.989 --> 32:38.724
(whispering):
Six. The rest with me.

32:41.994 --> 32:43.362
Two more. Go.

32:43.395 --> 32:45.664
(whispering indistinctly)

32:49.535 --> 32:52.338
(whispering):
One, two, three, four.

32:54.740 --> 32:56.142
Go, go.

33:02.381 --> 33:03.782
(muttering indistinctly)

33:03.815 --> 33:05.717
I'll go left, you right.

33:10.022 --> 33:11.223
(muffled scream)

33:11.257 --> 33:14.393
(muffled shouting)

33:14.426 --> 33:15.494
They went out the window!

33:15.527 --> 33:16.795
They went out the window!

33:16.828 --> 33:19.065
What do you see?

33:19.098 --> 33:20.566
No visual.

33:20.599 --> 33:21.967
(Sucre groaning loudly)

33:22.000 --> 33:24.970
Alpha One,
Alpha Two to portside, now.

33:25.003 --> 33:27.339
Copy that.

33:29.508 --> 33:30.809
(muffled):
Okay!

33:30.842 --> 33:33.512
Take... Take it off!

33:33.545 --> 33:34.546
What's your name?

33:34.580 --> 33:36.348
Fernando.

33:36.382 --> 33:38.016
Fernando Sucre.

33:38.050 --> 33:40.086
I'm a member of this crew.
Check the roster, man.

33:40.119 --> 33:42.020
I got no part in any of this.

33:42.054 --> 33:45.724
Check the roster
for Fernando Sucre.

33:47.393 --> 33:48.994
MAN (over radio):
Suspect seems to check out.

33:49.027 --> 33:51.430
Take him to the bridge.

33:51.463 --> 33:53.099
Yes, sir.

33:53.132 --> 33:55.434
Let's move.

33:59.638 --> 34:02.007
Absolutely no one gets off
this ship, understand?

34:02.040 --> 34:03.242
Sir.

34:17.956 --> 34:19.725
I don't know any Kaniel Outis.

34:19.757 --> 34:20.958
The guy's name is Scofield.

34:20.992 --> 34:22.293
Haven't seen him in years.

34:22.328 --> 34:24.295
He calls me,
he says he needs a ride.

34:24.330 --> 34:27.233
MAN: We got active pursuit
on engine deck.

34:27.266 --> 34:28.434
Watch him.

34:28.467 --> 34:30.969
The guy's name is Scofield!

34:31.002 --> 34:32.170
(machinery whirring)

34:34.639 --> 34:37.176
That's the door
Sucre told us about.

34:38.177 --> 34:39.545
There they are!

34:39.578 --> 34:41.147
Freeze! Freeze!

34:42.781 --> 34:44.716
Look alive, look alive!

34:44.750 --> 34:46.818
We've got them bottled up.

34:46.851 --> 34:49.621
LINCOLN:
Guys, come on! Hurry!

34:49.655 --> 34:50.621
WHIP:
Hurry!

34:50.656 --> 34:51.889
It's stuck!

34:51.922 --> 34:53.292
Come on!
It's stuck!

34:53.324 --> 34:55.393
It's stuck!

34:55.427 --> 34:56.661
Smoke them out, go!

35:03.702 --> 35:04.936
(rapid beeping)

35:09.107 --> 35:10.742
Tear gas.

35:10.776 --> 35:14.146
That hits the ventilation,
it's gonna ruin my cargo!

35:17.283 --> 35:19.318
You've always been
a loser, Sucre.

35:19.351 --> 35:20.752
Worst shipmate I ever hired.

35:20.786 --> 35:22.421
You brought this scum
on board my ship.

35:22.454 --> 35:24.190
They're your friends.
Where are they going?

35:24.223 --> 35:25.324
They're associates
of associates.

35:25.357 --> 35:27.193
I haven't seen them in years.

35:27.226 --> 35:28.627
But that's a good point.

35:28.660 --> 35:31.163
Why don't you tell
the nice SEAL here

35:31.197 --> 35:33.199
how you accepted payment
for their passage?

35:35.066 --> 35:38.270
(grunts)

35:38.304 --> 35:40.872
Maybe they're
your friends, not mine.

35:40.906 --> 35:43.108
(grunts)
Okay, okay.

35:43.141 --> 35:46.545
I heard them say something
about container 17.

35:52.050 --> 35:53.619
Oh.

35:53.652 --> 35:55.987
That container 17.

35:56.021 --> 35:59.725
The one with
your super secret cargo, huh?

35:59.758 --> 36:01.293
Weapons and munitions?

36:01.327 --> 36:04.530
Vincent, tangos
may be arming themselves.

36:04.563 --> 36:07.399
Man, they're not gonna like you
if they find that, are they?

36:07.433 --> 36:09.201
Vincent.

36:09.235 --> 36:11.803
You might just end up on
the terrorist watch list, too.

36:11.837 --> 36:12.804
Vincent, do you copy?

36:12.838 --> 36:14.740
(radio crackles)
Can't read you.

36:14.773 --> 36:18.577
Good-for-nothing Mexican.
You planned this.

36:18.610 --> 36:19.611
Stay here.

36:28.620 --> 36:30.121
17's still sealed.

36:34.460 --> 36:35.694
Captain?

36:38.897 --> 36:41.300
I'm Puerto Rican.

36:44.470 --> 36:45.404
(banging)

36:45.437 --> 36:47.639
12:00. You hear that?

36:49.275 --> 36:50.976
(grunting)

36:54.980 --> 36:56.181
MICHAEL:
Come on!

36:56.214 --> 36:58.049
(coughing)

37:01.620 --> 37:03.221
Go, go. Move!

37:06.224 --> 37:07.559
(boat creaking)

37:07.593 --> 37:08.860
What's going on?

37:08.894 --> 37:10.462
The ship's changing course.

37:10.496 --> 37:11.963
(panting)

37:11.997 --> 37:13.098
I did it, papi.

37:13.131 --> 37:15.100
No going
back now.

37:15.133 --> 37:16.468
(coughing)

37:16.502 --> 37:19.405
See what their next move is.

37:32.284 --> 37:34.986
JACOB: Do you remember
our honeymoon?

37:39.758 --> 37:41.560
Yeah, of course.

37:41.593 --> 37:43.562
How you opened up.

37:43.595 --> 37:47.333
Told me you carried shame
for what you did at Fox River.

37:47.366 --> 37:50.569
How some days you wished
you'd never heard

37:50.602 --> 37:52.638
the name Michael Scofield.

37:54.806 --> 37:57.108
Even admitted
to lying,

37:57.142 --> 37:59.177
keeping it
all from me.

37:59.210 --> 38:01.647
How you finally came clean

38:01.680 --> 38:04.483
and put it all behind you?

38:06.318 --> 38:08.086
Sure.

38:08.119 --> 38:11.256
I forgave you for the lies.

38:11.289 --> 38:13.425
Your past.

38:13.459 --> 38:15.126
Accepted you.

38:15.160 --> 38:17.295
Loved you and Mike.

38:17.329 --> 38:19.164
How is that not
enough for you?

38:28.907 --> 38:30.909
(phone ringing)

38:36.415 --> 38:37.649
HEATHER:
Hi.

38:37.683 --> 38:38.784
(whispering):
Hello?

38:38.817 --> 38:40.486
I have him.

38:40.519 --> 38:43.121
(sighs)
Thank God.

38:43.154 --> 38:44.690
He's fine.

38:44.723 --> 38:46.291
Headed home now.

38:46.324 --> 38:47.493
Hi, Mom.

38:47.526 --> 38:50.228
Oh, Heather, thank God.

38:50.261 --> 38:52.263
I'll be there soon.

39:18.790 --> 39:20.792
*

39:35.373 --> 39:37.042
Navigation's been trashed,

39:37.075 --> 39:39.177
the controls damaged.

39:39.210 --> 39:41.246
(boat creaking)

39:41.279 --> 39:42.514
Damn it.

39:42.548 --> 39:44.215
Tramp's off course.

39:44.249 --> 39:47.085
Moving toward Algerian waters,
top speed.

39:47.118 --> 39:48.520
Can we fix it?

39:48.554 --> 39:49.588
It'll take time.

39:49.621 --> 39:51.222
And by then we'd be out

39:51.256 --> 39:52.424
of international waters.

39:52.458 --> 39:55.461
Falcon One requesting orders.

39:55.494 --> 39:58.430
We have a situation.

39:58.464 --> 40:00.231
(phone ringing)

40:00.265 --> 40:01.767
Yeah.

40:01.800 --> 40:04.035
A&W: The SEAL team failed
to neutralize Outis.

40:04.069 --> 40:07.105
Somehow the ship's controls
were damaged.

40:07.138 --> 40:09.441
It's headed for Algerian waters
with our soldiers on boards,

40:09.475 --> 40:10.942
but it'll cause
a diplomatic incident

40:10.976 --> 40:13.378
if they stay to finish the job.

40:13.411 --> 40:15.781
The navy just made
the call to pull the team.

40:15.814 --> 40:17.449
All right, all right.

40:17.483 --> 40:19.284
The SEALs couldn't do it.
We escalate our move.

40:19.317 --> 40:21.219
Shouldn't have brought a knife
to a gunfight.

40:21.252 --> 40:22.788
I will handle from here.

40:22.821 --> 40:24.590
Thank you.

40:24.623 --> 40:26.625
(exhales)

40:36.802 --> 40:37.969
Sir.

40:38.003 --> 40:39.437
MAN:
Yes.

40:39.471 --> 40:42.407
I have an ask,
one that's imperative.

40:42.440 --> 40:45.443
I believe you'll find
that our interests are aligned.

41:00.959 --> 41:02.327
LINCOLN: What
are they doing?

41:02.360 --> 41:03.361
They're leaving.

41:03.394 --> 41:04.663
WHIP:
Why?

41:04.696 --> 41:05.864
Run!

41:05.897 --> 41:08.800
WHIP:
Oh, God. No, no, no, no!

41:12.037 --> 41:13.171
WHIP:
Hey!

41:13.204 --> 41:15.006
You're gonna want this.

41:23.882 --> 41:25.083
(grunts)

41:29.721 --> 41:30.922
(splashes)

41:34.392 --> 41:36.394
(explosion)

41:44.102 --> 41:47.172
Mike is safe where you can't
touch him, and this is over.

41:48.406 --> 41:51.409
The life,
the lies, the mask.

41:51.442 --> 41:54.212
You're gonna tell me everything.

41:54.245 --> 41:56.548
Like who you really are,

41:56.582 --> 41:59.651
what this was, all of it.

41:59.685 --> 42:03.555
It was our life.

42:03.589 --> 42:05.657
It's not over, Sara.

42:05.691 --> 42:08.426
Not even close.

42:08.459 --> 42:11.062
And Mike was never in danger.

42:11.096 --> 42:13.398
I love him.

42:13.431 --> 42:16.067
He is my family.

42:16.101 --> 42:18.203
I raised him.

42:18.236 --> 42:19.504
What have you done?

42:19.537 --> 42:21.707
No.

42:21.740 --> 42:23.909
It's what you've done, Sara.

42:23.942 --> 42:27.545
All of this
could've been avoided.

42:30.548 --> 42:31.850
Good sleepover?

42:31.883 --> 42:32.884
Yeah.

42:32.918 --> 42:34.519
Is Mommy coming to pick me up?

42:34.552 --> 42:36.955
Yes, sir.

42:38.489 --> 42:41.559
JACOB:
Michael's dead.

42:41.593 --> 42:44.596
Your Nightingale trip to Greece
led me straight to him.

42:44.630 --> 42:46.097
(gasps)

42:46.131 --> 42:49.701
So... it's all on you, Sara.

42:49.735 --> 42:52.971
And your plan with Heather
didn't work.

42:53.004 --> 42:55.240
Where's my son?
(gun clicks)

42:55.273 --> 42:56.241
I have him.

42:57.609 --> 42:59.277
And whether or not I
have to threaten him,

42:59.310 --> 43:01.212
which I don't want to do,

43:01.246 --> 43:04.783
is entirely contingent
upon you putting the gun down.

43:12.791 --> 43:14.092
(exhales)

43:54.966 --> 43:56.968
