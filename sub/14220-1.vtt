00:07.870 --> 00:09.540
(Eerie music playing)

00:31.910 --> 00:35.370
(indistinct chatter over radio)

00:51.540 --> 00:54.740
{\an8}(On speakers) <i>Ladies and gentlemen,
your intermission is almost over.</i>

00:54.910 --> 00:56.450
{\an8}<i>You have two minutes till show time.</i>

01:31.120 --> 01:32.160
I'd like Trojans.

01:35.540 --> 01:38.410
{\an8}(On speakers) <i>Ladies and gentlemen,
your intermission is almost over.</i>

01:39.200 --> 01:41.450
<i>You have one minute till show time.</i>

01:48.580 --> 01:50.870
{\an8}(Laughter)

02:06.240 --> 02:08.870
{\an8}(On speakers) <i>Ladies and gentlemen,
your intermission is over.</i>

02:23.620 --> 02:24.620
Come on, babe.

02:29.290 --> 02:30.290
(Grunts)

02:44.950 --> 02:45.990
(Woman) Mmm.

02:51.040 --> 02:53.240
(Woman screams in the background)

02:55.290 --> 02:56.290
(Man sighs)

02:56.990 --> 02:57.990
What is it?

02:58.910 --> 03:01.120
(Whispering) It's the boys. The boys.

03:01.700 --> 03:03.700
Look, they've been asleep for half an hour.

03:07.990 --> 03:09.540
Don't worry about it.

03:12.410 --> 03:13.410
(Signs)

03:28.160 --> 03:29.160
(Man) Hmm.

03:33.830 --> 03:34.830
Psst!

03:36.620 --> 03:38.080
(Boy, whispering) Mom's at it again.

03:41.240 --> 03:42.790
Let's get out of here.

04:40.240 --> 04:42.580
(Moaning)

04:52.450 --> 04:53.450
Get out of here, creep.

04:54.660 --> 04:56.700
Hey, hey, get out of here.

04:57.200 --> 04:58.540
What are you doing? Get lost.

04:58.740 --> 05:00.040
Beat it.

05:02.370 --> 05:03.740
(Screaming)

05:08.080 --> 05:09.080
Ahhh!

05:12.990 --> 05:13.990
(Screaming continues)

05:15.160 --> 05:16.410
(Groans)

05:18.740 --> 05:19.740
(Woman, screaming) Help me!

05:19.790 --> 05:21.910
Help me! Help!

05:24.790 --> 05:26.370
(Low voice) I thought
I heard somebody scream.

05:27.330 --> 05:28.330
(Signs)

05:29.160 --> 05:31.410
All right, look, let's get out of here.
This is ridiculous.

05:31.910 --> 05:34.240
You know, I don't do women
who drag their kids around everywhere.

05:34.490 --> 05:35.870
OK. Take me home.

05:40.620 --> 05:43.290
Oh, my God.
Where are the boys?

05:45.240 --> 05:46.330
MY boys have gone!

05:52.830 --> 05:54.660
(Yelling) Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mom!

05:55.410 --> 05:56.410
Mom!

05:58.950 --> 05:59.950
- Mom!
- Terry!

06:01.240 --> 06:03.740
- Lemme go. Terry.
- Mom!

06:03.790 --> 06:05.740
- Terry, you're all right? What happened?
- I'm fine.

06:05.790 --> 06:08.160
He did... He just hurt that person.
He just hurt him.

06:08.580 --> 06:10.660
Terry, stop it. Stop it. Stop it.

06:11.160 --> 06:13.740
Son, it's all right. No, it's all right.
Mommy's here. It's fine.

06:16.580 --> 06:17.620
Todd.

06:18.830 --> 06:19.910
Todd.

06:21.830 --> 06:22.830
Todd!

06:23.580 --> 06:27.200
(Siren wailing)

06:49.790 --> 06:51.080
(Man) Thank you, Mrs Simmons.

06:51.830 --> 06:54.490
- Happy Thanksgiving to you.
- Same to you, Mrs Simmons.

07:10.490 --> 07:13.200
I thought that it was
important for us to meet today,

07:13.240 --> 07:15.990
because as you know I've been
working with Todd the last few months.

07:16.370 --> 07:20.870
(Dr. Berman) <i>Dr. Berman's patient
consultation notes, November 22nd 1984.</i>

07:21.740 --> 07:25.240
<i>Saw Maddy Simmons, Todd's mother,
for the first time today.</i>

07:25.990 --> 07:28.990
<i>I don't think she was
quite prepared for what I told her.</i>

07:29.370 --> 07:30.660
<i>That after 10 years,</i>

07:30.740 --> 07:33.950
<i>Todd was starting to remember
what had happened in the drive-in that night.</i>

07:34.490 --> 07:37.040
<i>Facing the fact
that Todd's memory of the incident</i>

07:37.080 --> 07:39.870
<i>cast suspicion on his twin brother, Terry,</i>

07:39.910 --> 07:41.450
<i>was not that easy for her.</i>

07:41.660 --> 07:42.830
On Terry?

07:43.450 --> 07:45.080
What, are you crazy?

07:45.240 --> 07:47.830
<i>Her position on another issue
was also somewhat negative.</i>

07:47.910 --> 07:49.370
No! No!

07:49.740 --> 07:50.910
No more tests.

07:51.160 --> 07:52.580
No more tests.

07:53.290 --> 07:55.910
My children are not guinea pigs.

07:56.240 --> 07:59.740
<i>My past work with hysterical patients
helped me calm her down.</i>

08:00.080 --> 08:01.240
I'm sorry.

08:04.410 --> 08:08.080
<i>Though calmer, Maddy's level of resistance
was still quite high.</i>

08:08.740 --> 08:09.990
<i>I wondered...</i>

08:10.120 --> 08:12.950
<i>How would she react
when confronted with Todd himself?</i>

08:13.990 --> 08:17.160
<i>How would Todd respond to Maddy
in view of his new recollections?</i>

08:17.990 --> 08:19.490
<i>I was not without worry.</i>

08:19.910 --> 08:22.830
<i>After all, I had never seen
the two of them together.</i>

08:26.410 --> 08:27.410
It's your favorite.

08:28.080 --> 08:29.490
Pumpkin pie.

08:30.580 --> 08:32.580
(Dr. Berman) <i>Maddy
treated Todd like a child.</i>

08:32.870 --> 08:35.909
<i>As if no time had passed
since the evening of the murder.</i>

08:37.039 --> 08:40.580
<i>Their initial tension was predictable
in light of Todd's breakthrough.</i>

08:41.409 --> 08:45.410
<i>The trauma of watching his twin
commit murder had made Todd catatonic.</i>

08:46.240 --> 08:47.910
<i>In that state, he couldn't fight</i>

08:47.950 --> 08:51.330
<i>what he now sees as punishment
for a crime he did not commit.</i>

08:52.240 --> 08:54.240
<i>Maddy persisted in defending Terry.</i>

08:54.540 --> 08:57.240
<i>And espousing her notion
of one big, happy family</i>

08:57.330 --> 09:01.040
<i>without realizing that such ideas
had ceased to have any meaning for Todd.</i>

09:01.370 --> 09:02.450
(Todd) Family. I don't...

09:03.580 --> 09:05.700
(Muttering) I don't care about...

09:06.700 --> 09:10.910
(Dr. Berman) <i>His world and my work
were beginning to crumble.</i>

09:11.620 --> 09:13.200
Todd, please don't do this.

09:13.370 --> 09:16.040
- Honey, just stop it. Honey, please.
- (Buzzer sounds)

09:16.700 --> 09:18.740
Sweetheart, its Dr. Berman's office.

09:20.120 --> 09:22.740
(Dr. Berman) <i>But in spite of
the dramatic nature of today's outburst,</i>

09:23.080 --> 09:25.330
<i>I consider the setback relatively minor</i>

09:25.580 --> 09:28.700
<i>because Todd remained focused
on establishing his innocence,</i>

09:28.830 --> 09:30.410
<i>and getting on with a normal life.</i>

09:30.580 --> 09:32.740
(Todd) Get me out of here.
I never killed anybody.

09:32.830 --> 09:35.660
(Dr. Berman) <i>I must now begin
the long process of preparing him</i>

09:35.740 --> 09:38.620
<i>for the dangers of the world
from which he has been sheltered.</i>

09:38.910 --> 09:39.910
(All) Break.

09:43.120 --> 09:44.790
(Terry) All right, you rush.
I'm going to cover Karen.

09:44.870 --> 09:46.160
(Dr. Berman) <i>As for Terry,</i>

09:46.370 --> 09:48.580
<i>he mustn't find out that I suspect him.</i>

09:49.330 --> 09:51.080
<i>He's been normal for 10 years.</i>

09:51.790 --> 09:54.290
<i>But who knows what
will trigger another killing?</i>

09:54.370 --> 09:56.040
- (Laughter)
- I think I got you.

09:56.540 --> 09:57.540
(Group) Aww.

09:58.540 --> 10:01.790
Come on, it's a football game,
not a kissing contest.

10:03.410 --> 10:04.910
(Laughter and chatter)

10:07.830 --> 10:09.290
(indistinct chatter)

10:15.910 --> 10:17.240
You must be Terry!

10:17.330 --> 10:18.740
Your mom's told me all about you.

10:19.080 --> 10:20.120
I am Beth, your new neighbor.

10:20.200 --> 10:22.830
This is Andrea. She's just
home from college, too.

10:23.620 --> 10:25.330
Your mom invited us
for Thanksgiving tonight

10:25.410 --> 10:27.910
and we will both be just delighted to come.

10:27.950 --> 10:30.410
Great! Why don't you play football with us?

10:31.490 --> 10:32.990
I don't really know anybody here yet.

10:33.410 --> 10:34.660
Oh, come on, you'll have fun.

10:35.540 --> 10:37.240
Hey, who's that good-looking
chick with him?

10:37.370 --> 10:38.870
(Scoffs) I don't know.

10:41.740 --> 10:43.490
Listen, everybody.
Let's go up for a swim, huh?

10:43.580 --> 10:44.830
Yeah, let's go.

10:45.990 --> 10:47.740
(Laughter)

10:53.290 --> 10:54.830
You never told me that one!

10:58.830 --> 11:00.240
Before we start,

11:01.910 --> 11:03.160
Brad and I

11:04.290 --> 11:06.200
have an announcement to make.

11:08.040 --> 11:09.120
Come on, honey.

11:09.870 --> 11:10.870
You tell them.

11:12.080 --> 11:13.080
Well...

11:13.200 --> 11:14.580
- We're going to tie the knot.
- We're getting married.

11:14.740 --> 11:16.370
(All cheering)

11:16.540 --> 11:17.910
(Woman) Great!

11:24.740 --> 11:26.240
Congratulations, Mom!

11:27.740 --> 11:28.790
Terry.

11:29.410 --> 11:33.910
Oh, Terry. I love you so much.

11:34.910 --> 11:36.910
Aw. That's really nice.

11:38.790 --> 11:41.040
Congratulations. I'm happy for you both.

11:41.080 --> 11:42.120
I really am.

11:42.910 --> 11:44.200
- (Brad) Thanks.
- (Laughing)

11:44.790 --> 11:46.740
I guess that a toast is in order.

11:46.910 --> 11:48.240
Oh, a toast.

11:50.660 --> 11:51.990
Here's to the new family.

11:52.580 --> 11:53.580
- (Glass clinking)
- That's nice.

12:00.740 --> 12:05.240
Well, I'd say that this big
bird is ready for carving.

12:07.410 --> 12:09.290
Terry, you do the honors.

12:12.240 --> 12:14.240
Well, seeing as how
we have a new head of the family,

12:14.660 --> 12:16.910
I think it's time you started
pulling your own weight around here.

12:17.040 --> 12:18.490
(Chuckles) Thanks, buddy.

12:25.410 --> 12:27.040
Listen. Dig in, everybody.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.120
Dig in.

12:28.240 --> 12:29.580
I mean on the other stuff.

12:29.660 --> 12:30.910
(Woman) Oh, great. OK.

12:30.950 --> 12:33.620
- (Phone ringing)
- Oh. Excuse me, excuse me. I'll be right back.

12:39.450 --> 12:41.450
(Woman) So, Andrea, tell me,
what year are you in?

12:41.700 --> 12:43.040
Junior. You?

12:43.080 --> 12:44.410
Well, it's my first year.

12:44.910 --> 12:46.370
Um, I really love it though.

12:46.410 --> 12:47.870
My classes are great!

12:48.160 --> 12:50.080
(Andrea) I was like that
for about a week,

12:50.120 --> 12:52.490
then all I wanted to do
was party and play tennis.

12:53.700 --> 12:55.290
- You play tennis?
- (Andrea) Yeah!

12:55.370 --> 12:56.410
Then we should play sometime.

12:57.160 --> 12:59.790
Great. You've got to have friends here.

12:59.870 --> 13:01.240
This place is slow death.

13:01.540 --> 13:03.790
And at Christmas, we're going
to be stuck here for a week.

13:03.990 --> 13:05.990
Oh, we'll find something for you to do.

13:07.040 --> 13:08.370
(Andrea) I hope so.

13:09.240 --> 13:11.120
Oh, I'm babysitting for Julie tonight.

13:11.910 --> 13:14.700
Why don't you come by?
I'm gonna be so bored.

13:15.080 --> 13:17.240
- Oh, I'd love to.
- Great!

13:17.290 --> 13:18.700
(Maddy) Terry?

13:18.740 --> 13:20.330
Could you help me for a moment?

13:20.410 --> 13:21.660
Coming, Mom.

13:21.990 --> 13:22.990
(Chuckles)

13:28.740 --> 13:30.290
That was the school that just called.

13:31.490 --> 13:32.660
They can't find Todd.

13:33.950 --> 13:35.740
What do you mean, "They can't find Todd?"

13:36.580 --> 13:37.660
Did he run away?

13:39.080 --> 13:40.990
And they think that he might come here.

13:41.740 --> 13:42.910
Oh, wow!

13:44.410 --> 13:45.700
What are we supposed to do?

13:48.540 --> 13:49.990
They're out looking for him now.

13:50.870 --> 13:52.870
And his doctor is on her way over here.

13:54.240 --> 13:55.290
(Signs)

13:55.370 --> 13:57.580
Brad, are you're almost done?
I wanna a slice of turkey.

13:57.620 --> 13:58.870
I'm getting there, I'm getting there.

13:58.910 --> 13:59.910
All right, hurry up.

14:01.740 --> 14:05.080
Listen, let's just pretend
that nothing's happened.

14:05.700 --> 14:07.740
I just don't wanna spoil things.

14:08.290 --> 14:09.830
I mean, it is Thanksgiving,

14:10.200 --> 14:13.330
and everyone's been looking
forward to the dinner so much.

14:13.910 --> 14:15.120
Anybody else need more turkey?

14:15.290 --> 14:16.410
No. I'm pretty good. Thanks.

14:17.240 --> 14:18.910
- For a minute.
- Very nice.

14:22.120 --> 14:23.290
Everything OK?

14:23.790 --> 14:24.950
Hot bread, everybody!

14:25.740 --> 14:27.910
Looks like you're getting a chance
to meet the rest of the family.

14:28.580 --> 14:30.120
My psychotic brother just escaped.

14:32.830 --> 14:36.540
(Andrea) Terry, is something really wrong
with him or is he just a little loonie?

14:36.580 --> 14:38.660
- (Beth) Andrea!
- Just asking, Mom.

14:39.080 --> 14:40.580
Would you pass the green beans, please?

14:41.410 --> 14:44.410
- Brad?
- Oh, the green beans, yeah, sure.

14:44.660 --> 14:45.660
Thanks.

14:47.580 --> 14:49.120
Gee, this looks good, Mom.

15:24.290 --> 15:25.290
(Exhales)

15:28.080 --> 15:29.080
Come here, you.

15:32.740 --> 15:34.080
It's been a long day.

15:35.160 --> 15:36.740
Time for you to get off your feet.

15:38.080 --> 15:39.870
Why don't you get out of here
and I'll finish up?

15:46.200 --> 15:48.240
I think everything went very well.

15:52.740 --> 15:54.410
The turkey was perfect.

16:12.580 --> 16:13.580
(Door opens)

16:40.910 --> 16:42.240
I'm sorry. I can't now.

16:42.540 --> 16:43.540
(Door closes)

16:43.660 --> 16:48.160
I mean, Terry's in the next room
and Todd's out there all alone.

16:49.620 --> 16:50.870
I'm just so worried.

16:50.910 --> 16:52.580
What if he comes here?

16:52.620 --> 16:55.040
Hey, hey, don't worry. I'll be here.

16:56.450 --> 16:58.410
- We'll handle it.
- (Sniffling)

17:03.160 --> 17:06.329
I'm sorry. Guess I'm just
a little nervous. That's all.

17:07.410 --> 17:10.740
Maybe, if I straighten the place
up a little, I'll feel better.

17:10.790 --> 17:11.829
That's what I am gonna do.

17:11.910 --> 17:14.079
- I'm gonna just straighten the place up.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, babe.

17:14.119 --> 17:18.240
It's OK. I mean, he's probably
hiding in a closet back at school.

17:19.240 --> 17:21.200
So, relax. OK?

17:23.079 --> 17:24.829
Oh, Brad.

17:27.910 --> 17:29.410
I'm so glad you're here.

17:39.200 --> 17:40.490
(Doorbell ringing)

17:47.160 --> 17:48.410
- Hey!
- I got him, Doc.

17:48.450 --> 17:49.830
(Dr. Berman) Put that gun down.

17:49.910 --> 17:52.290
It's his twin. Can't you see?
You are Terry, aren't you?

17:52.370 --> 17:54.990
Don't worry about the gun.
It's only a tranquilizer gun.

17:55.080 --> 17:57.370
Now, listen. I'm Dr. Berman,
I'm from the institute,

17:57.410 --> 17:58.870
- I want to see your mother.
- Dr. Berman!

17:58.910 --> 18:00.910
- Did you find him?
- No, I haven't even looked yet.

18:00.990 --> 18:02.490
What's that gun?

18:02.580 --> 18:03.660
It's OK, Mom.

18:03.740 --> 18:05.620
Hey, hey. I'm Brad King.
I'm the manager here.

18:05.700 --> 18:06.830
Maybe I can be of some help.

18:06.910 --> 18:08.120
(Dr. Berman) Yes.
Would you please help me?

18:08.200 --> 18:10.370
Sure. Uh, listen, I'm gonna take care of them

18:10.410 --> 18:11.450
and I'll be down in my office.

18:11.540 --> 18:13.410
Now, you stay here
and don't worry, I won't be long.

18:13.490 --> 18:15.120
OK, but just don't be long.

18:15.200 --> 18:16.410
- I won't.
- OK.

18:16.490 --> 18:17.950
Take care of your mother. Come on.

18:20.160 --> 18:22.040
(Man) Nice place you got here, Mr. King.

18:22.080 --> 18:24.660
Were you around when the
Simmons kid first turned into a wacko?

18:24.740 --> 18:26.120
Come on, Mom. It's all right.

18:26.830 --> 18:28.700
- (Dr. Berman) Let me do the talking.
- It's all right.

18:28.740 --> 18:30.370
(Man) OK, Dr. B. Sorry.

18:30.950 --> 18:31.950
Sorry, Mr. King.

18:33.620 --> 18:35.240
Now, how can I help you?

18:35.740 --> 18:37.410
You can tell me where I should start looking.

18:37.620 --> 18:40.080
OK. We got about 10 acres here.

18:40.120 --> 18:41.580
Now, if he were on the grounds,

18:41.620 --> 18:44.160
he would probably be hiding
on one of the back patios.

18:44.240 --> 18:45.290
Mmm-hmm.

18:45.370 --> 18:48.200
And we have a nature walk
through the woods, right back here.

18:48.240 --> 18:49.410
You might want to check that.

18:50.040 --> 18:51.410
Do you keep any guards here?

18:52.120 --> 18:53.660
No. We never had any trouble before.

18:54.490 --> 18:56.620
All right.
I'm going to start looking with Jackie.

18:57.120 --> 18:58.870
Where will we find you when we're finished?

18:58.910 --> 19:01.830
OK. My office is in
Room 137, right down there.

19:01.910 --> 19:03.450
If you need any help, that's where I will be.

19:03.540 --> 19:04.660
Fine. Thank you.

19:06.240 --> 19:07.620
Jackie...

19:07.700 --> 19:11.080
You're gonna go down there
and you're going to search all the patios.

19:11.740 --> 19:13.910
And I'm gonna go out into the woods.

19:13.990 --> 19:17.120
But Dr. B, maybe I ought to go with you,
you know, in case, there's a problem.

19:17.620 --> 19:19.450
Jackie, I can take care of myself.

19:19.540 --> 19:21.120
Give me the gun and just go.

19:22.040 --> 19:23.040
Now.

19:28.080 --> 19:31.080
(Man on radio) <i>This is </i> The

Oh, thank God.

- (Brad) <i>How are you?</i>
- No, I'm just so worried.

19:54.700 --> 19:55.990
Everything's OK?

19:56.580 --> 19:58.660
The doctor and her assistant
are out looking around,

19:58.740 --> 19:59.990
they're not going to find anything.

20:00.990 --> 20:02.330
But just in case, I'm here.

20:03.120 --> 20:06.080
Uh-huh. Stop it. It's OK. It's OK.

20:07.330 --> 20:10.410
No, I feel it's just like a burden for you
and it's too much for you.

20:10.450 --> 20:11.910
And it's my problem.

20:11.990 --> 20:13.410
And I just...

20:13.450 --> 20:14.830
(Brad talking indistinctly)

20:17.790 --> 20:18.910
I love you, too.

20:52.240 --> 20:53.660

what the cat brought in.

20:53.830 --> 20:54.830

(Dr. Berman) Todd?

21:22.330 --> 21:23.330
(Jackie) Todd, are you out there?

21:24.490 --> 21:26.910
Come on out. Damn, Todd.

21:27.240 --> 21:28.290
This isn't funny.

21:28.870 --> 21:29.870
(Cat yowls)

21:32.080 --> 21:33.830
Shit. Get a grip on yourself.

21:35.370 --> 21:36.370
Todd?

21:37.240 --> 21:39.910
Dr. B is gonna kill both of
us if I don't bring you back.

21:40.990 --> 21:42.080
(Dr. Berman) Todd?

21:42.580 --> 21:45.370
Todd, I don't like this, Todd,
you better come back.

21:49.580 --> 21:50.580
Hey, Todd.

21:51.950 --> 21:53.240
I got some goodies.

21:54.200 --> 21:55.290
You wanna get high?

21:56.910 --> 21:58.370
Then you gotta come out first.

21:59.410 --> 22:00.410
Come on, Todd.

22:02.580 --> 22:06.160
(In sing-song) He's a lunatic. Lunatic.

22:07.990 --> 22:09.040
(Humming)

22:23.450 --> 22:25.790
Terry, right?
It's Terry, right?

22:26.450 --> 22:29.910
(Terry) Yeah. You're uh,
Dr. Berman's friend.

22:29.950 --> 22:31.080
Yeah.

22:31.120 --> 22:34.580
Damn, you guys look so much alike.
It's... It's frightening.

22:35.200 --> 22:37.410
Hey, I'm really sorry about what
happened back at the house.

22:37.490 --> 22:38.490
Well, that's all right.

22:39.200 --> 22:41.410
Damn. You guys sure look a lot alike.

22:42.120 --> 22:44.490
Hey, Dr Berman told me to relax,

22:44.580 --> 22:46.330
so I was relaxing.

22:47.160 --> 22:49.410
- Hey, you want a hit?
- Sure. Thanks.

22:50.040 --> 22:51.540
You know what else Dr. Berman told me?

22:52.410 --> 22:53.950
Mmm-mmm. What?

22:54.040 --> 22:56.120
She told me that Todd

22:56.870 --> 22:58.080
never killed anybody.

23:03.040 --> 23:04.410
- (Terry) Yes, he did!
- (Screaming)

23:16.490 --> 23:17.660
Yes, he did.

23:35.370 --> 23:36.580
Todd?

23:36.990 --> 23:37.990
(Frogs croaking)

23:44.870 --> 23:45.870
Todd?

23:46.910 --> 23:49.040
Todd, it's Dr. Berman, Todd.

23:50.290 --> 23:52.700
Please come out, Todd. I'm here to help you.

24:08.830 --> 24:09.950

(Line ringing)

24:58.620 --> 25:00.370

25:30.080 --> 25:31.580
It's not cranberry sauce.

26:18.160 --> 26:19.830

26:33.540 --> 26:37.450

(Door knocking)

26:45.240 --> 26:46.240
(Andrea) Terry!

26:46.450 --> 26:48.080
Hi. Come on in. Want a drink?

26:48.740 --> 26:49.740
Oh, I'd love one.

26:49.910 --> 26:51.990
I've got vodka and tomato juice

26:52.080 --> 26:53.740
or tomato juice and vodka.

26:53.790 --> 26:55.410
- Just tomato juice.
- Sure?

26:55.490 --> 26:57.120
- I don't drink.
- OK.

27:00.200 --> 27:02.240
- Any news on your brother?
- No.

27:02.620 --> 27:03.910
God, I heard about what he did.

27:03.950 --> 27:06.200
Must have been a drag
for you and your mom.

27:06.830 --> 27:09.330
I don't like to talk about my brother, Todd.
It gives me nightmares.

27:09.410 --> 27:10.580
(Andrea) Sorry.

27:10.620 --> 27:11.620
Let's talk about something else.

27:12.370 --> 27:13.370
OK.

27:15.080 --> 27:16.120
Got a major, yet?

27:16.290 --> 27:17.410
(Terry) Psychology. You?

27:18.410 --> 27:20.660
I told you. Partying.

27:21.330 --> 27:22.410
Right.

27:24.330 --> 27:25.790
I wonder if there's anything
good on the tube.

27:26.370 --> 27:27.370
(Chuckles)

27:42.740 --> 27:43.740
Phew.

27:46.660 --> 27:48.080
OK, Karen, this is it.

27:49.790 --> 27:50.910
(Doorbell rings)

27:58.580 --> 27:59.740
Terry?

28:03.080 --> 28:04.330
Hey, Simmons.

28:09.540 --> 28:11.330
(Scoffs) I don't believe this.

28:14.450 --> 28:15.450
(Karen) Simmons?

28:15.870 --> 28:17.240
Hey, Terry?

28:18.040 --> 28:19.040
Terry?

28:20.120 --> 28:22.450
Come on. Where are you?

28:24.330 --> 28:25.330
Terry?

28:27.490 --> 28:28.620
Oh, brother!

28:29.370 --> 28:30.580
Terry?

28:30.620 --> 28:33.370
(Gasps) Oh, my gosh!

28:34.410 --> 28:36.580
Terry, you scared me to death!

28:37.700 --> 28:40.330
Oh. I thought you were hiding from me.

28:41.540 --> 28:42.580
Oh.

28:43.950 --> 28:44.950
So, um...

28:45.040 --> 28:47.240
Listen, we didn't get much
of a chance to talk at dinner

28:47.290 --> 28:49.910
and well, you wanna talk?

28:52.240 --> 28:53.490
Hey...

28:53.990 --> 28:55.410
You're high, aren't you?

28:55.830 --> 28:59.080
(Laughing) You always get
real quiet when you're high.

29:02.450 --> 29:03.490
Well, Terry?

29:04.450 --> 29:05.740
Well, look, um...

29:05.830 --> 29:06.830
(Clears throat)

29:07.870 --> 29:09.540
You know, we've both been
away at school

29:09.580 --> 29:12.740
and I don't know,
we haven't talked to each other.

29:12.830 --> 29:14.370
You haven't written me any letters

29:14.410 --> 29:17.490
and I've hardly even seen you
since you've gotten back.

29:18.620 --> 29:21.740
And, I don't know, Terry. I just love you a lot.

29:21.830 --> 29:22.830
And...

29:23.540 --> 29:24.540
Well...

29:25.700 --> 29:27.160
I want you to make love to me.

29:29.410 --> 29:30.910
You're shocked, huh?

29:30.990 --> 29:32.330
(Laughing)

29:33.080 --> 29:35.870
Well, Terry, come on,
I wish you'd say something.

29:37.870 --> 29:38.990
I'm not Terry.

29:39.910 --> 29:41.080
I'm Todd.

29:41.160 --> 29:43.370
Um, Terry's brother?

29:44.990 --> 29:46.330
Oh, my God.

29:46.540 --> 29:47.540
I mean, um...

29:47.870 --> 29:49.580
So, you're home for the holidays, huh?

29:50.330 --> 29:51.330
You seem nice.

29:52.120 --> 29:53.870
I've never kissed a girl before.

29:54.290 --> 29:55.700
Oh, yeah. Well, um...

29:56.240 --> 29:58.540
You really ought to try it sometime.
I gotta go. Bye.

30:07.160 --> 30:08.240
Hey, Artie!

30:08.330 --> 30:09.790
Artie, come here.

30:09.870 --> 30:10.910
Hurry up.

30:11.580 --> 30:12.910
Come here.

30:12.990 --> 30:14.910
You guys are not gonna believe this!

30:14.990 --> 30:15.990
(Music playing on car radio)

30:16.450 --> 30:19.120
Terry's insane brother is here.
I just saw him out back.

30:19.200 --> 30:21.410
Are you crazy or something?
This guy's in some nuthouse.

30:21.490 --> 30:24.160
No, really, they called during dinner.
He escaped.

30:24.740 --> 30:26.330
Oh, shit. We better find Terry.

30:26.450 --> 30:29.830
Oh, no way. I am not
going back there. Uh-uh.

30:29.910 --> 30:30.910
We'll go.

30:30.990 --> 30:32.910
Oh, great. The both of you?

30:32.990 --> 30:34.240
I better stay with Karen.

30:34.330 --> 30:35.830
Listen, I'm not afraid of this guy.

30:40.240 --> 30:41.410
Just in case.

30:41.540 --> 30:44.790
(Karen) Wait a minute, Artie.
That is ridiculous. Don't be stupid.

30:53.410 --> 30:54.580
Yo, Simmons?

30:55.580 --> 30:56.580
You back here?

30:58.080 --> 31:00.450
Well, he looked exactly like Terry.

31:00.540 --> 31:04.410
Except that he had this really
wild, crazed look in his eyes.

31:04.450 --> 31:06.290
I mean, I almost peed in my pants.

31:06.410 --> 31:08.040
- Pretty scary.
- Yeah.

31:09.410 --> 31:10.740
(Karen) What are you doing?

31:10.790 --> 31:12.490
I'm just trying to calm you down a little bit.

31:12.580 --> 31:15.080
Well, stop it. You're just
making me more nervous.

31:16.620 --> 31:17.830
(Artie) Nobody back there.

31:19.740 --> 31:21.240
(Karen) Maybe we should call the police.

31:21.330 --> 31:22.450
Now, cool your jets.

31:22.580 --> 31:24.080
When Terry gets here, he'll know what to do.

31:24.240 --> 31:26.790
Yeah, but you guys, don't you think
we should be doing something?

31:28.240 --> 31:29.240
<i>My God!</i>

31:34.410 --> 31:35.740
(Grunting)

31:38.490 --> 31:39.910
(Terry) God. That's horrible.

31:40.910 --> 31:42.240
How can they show that on TV?

31:50.990 --> 31:52.290
What are you doing?

31:52.790 --> 31:53.790
(Door opening)

31:54.580 --> 31:56.450
What's going on here, you two?

31:57.990 --> 31:59.910
- Absolutely nothing!
- (Laughing)

32:02.200 --> 32:03.410
Baby OK?

32:03.540 --> 32:05.370
Oh, little bugger didn't make a sound.

32:05.410 --> 32:07.290
Ah! Thank you so much, Andy, honey.

32:07.370 --> 32:09.910
You're welcome.
Um, Julie, the $10?

32:10.450 --> 32:11.830
$10?

32:12.910 --> 32:15.120
(Sighs) Well, I'll look.

32:15.200 --> 32:16.410
(Opens purse)

32:16.490 --> 32:20.080
Oh, yeah. Please.
Let me take care of this, all right?

32:20.870 --> 32:22.660
(Chuckles) Thank you.

32:23.410 --> 32:24.410
No problem.

32:26.910 --> 32:29.200
Looks like you two have
had quite a party.

32:29.240 --> 32:30.240
(sniffs)

32:30.540 --> 32:32.540
I wouldn't drive anywhere, if I were you.

32:32.580 --> 32:33.790
Oh, Bill.

32:35.740 --> 32:36.910
They're neighbors.

32:37.580 --> 32:41.240
And besides, I told them
they could help themselves.

32:41.580 --> 32:43.080
I'm only looking out for you.

32:43.240 --> 32:45.990
You could get in trouble for
getting minors intoxicated.

32:46.410 --> 32:47.910
Oh, we're not minors, sir.

32:48.330 --> 32:49.370
- Good night.
- (Julie chuckles)

32:49.450 --> 32:53.580
Don't pay any attention to him.
He's just looking out for me.

32:55.950 --> 32:57.080
- Let's grab some more beer.
- (Car radio playing)

32:58.410 --> 33:00.910
(Karen) Hey. Wait a minute.
Isn't that Terry over there?

33:01.040 --> 33:02.120
- Where?
- Right over there.

33:02.240 --> 33:03.910
Yeah, it is.
We better check this out.

33:12.700 --> 33:14.080
- (Artie) Hey, buddy.
- Hi. What's up?

33:14.660 --> 33:17.080
Terry, I just saw your brother
and he tried to kiss me.

33:18.160 --> 33:19.330
At least he has your taste.

33:19.870 --> 33:21.240
Damn. That's a great idea!

33:21.740 --> 33:24.910
Why don't we have a welcome-home
party for Terry's crazy brother?

33:24.950 --> 33:25.950
All right!

33:26.040 --> 33:27.330
Not funny, Gregg.

33:27.950 --> 33:29.740
Did you see him for real?
Or are you goofing on me?

33:30.450 --> 33:31.620
Yes, I saw him for real.

33:31.700 --> 33:34.240
Do you think I'm going to kid you
about something like that?

33:36.450 --> 33:37.700
Hey, where you going?

33:38.160 --> 33:39.160
To find him.

33:39.910 --> 33:42.290
Look, you don't understand. He's nuts.
That's why they locked him up!

33:42.740 --> 33:44.370
(Laughing) It's like the rest of your family!

33:44.790 --> 33:46.580
- That's not funny, man. That's not funny.
- Hey, hey!

33:46.620 --> 33:48.410
What's eating you? Chill out.

33:53.290 --> 33:54.990
(Karen) Hey, um, should I come with you?

33:55.790 --> 33:56.830
No.

33:58.080 --> 33:59.450
Gregg, you think he's really pissed off?

33:59.620 --> 34:00.830
(Mocking) Nah.

34:01.740 --> 34:03.330
You guys, forget about him.

34:03.410 --> 34:04.950
If you're really serious
about doing some partying,

34:05.080 --> 34:06.120
let's go back to my place.

34:06.240 --> 34:09.080
My mom's gone for the night.
I've got plenty of stuff. How about it?

34:09.489 --> 34:11.290
Sounds good to me. What about you, Artie?

34:11.370 --> 34:12.830
- You don't have to twist my arm.
- Let's go!

34:16.409 --> 34:17.949
(Artie) Karen? Come on.

34:18.330 --> 34:19.909
(Andrea) Yeah, Karen. Come with us.

34:38.790 --> 34:40.080
Oh! Oh!

34:40.199 --> 34:41.199
(Terry) He's here!

34:41.239 --> 34:42.989
- What?
- Todd.

34:43.370 --> 34:44.540
- He's here.
- (Vacuum switches off)

34:45.580 --> 34:46.580
Here?

34:47.909 --> 34:49.080
With the doctor?

34:50.370 --> 34:52.080
No. He's still loose.

34:54.040 --> 34:55.040
Oh, my God.

34:55.159 --> 34:56.739
Karen said that she saw him.

34:58.240 --> 34:59.950
I can't find that doctor anywhere.

35:00.080 --> 35:01.080
I think maybe she left.

35:02.040 --> 35:03.200
Where's Brad?

35:05.160 --> 35:06.160
I don't know.

35:15.700 --> 35:17.290
(Line ringing)

35:29.200 --> 35:30.870
Should we call the police?

35:31.240 --> 35:32.240
No!

35:33.410 --> 35:34.830
Find Brad.

35:35.120 --> 35:36.620
He's probably out looking.

35:37.870 --> 35:40.830
I'll stay here in case Todd comes home.

35:42.240 --> 35:46.740
But Terry, be very careful.
He's probably very frightened.

35:47.870 --> 35:51.950
And Terry, please put on a sweater.
It's cold outside.

35:54.410 --> 35:55.740
The blue one.

36:09.490 --> 36:11.490
(Todd sniffling)

36:18.700 --> 36:19.700
Why?

36:24.370 --> 36:25.580
I know you believed me.

36:27.040 --> 36:29.080
Why didn't you do something?

36:43.330 --> 36:44.450
(Girl) Tinker.

36:47.540 --> 36:48.870
Tinker.

36:51.330 --> 36:52.410
Tinker.

36:53.910 --> 36:55.160
Tinker.

36:57.370 --> 37:00.490
- Hi.
- I've lost my cat. Have you seen it?

37:00.830 --> 37:01.870
No.

37:02.410 --> 37:03.740
But do you know what?

37:03.790 --> 37:04.910
What?

37:05.240 --> 37:07.700
Cats have a way of finding
their own way home.

37:08.330 --> 37:10.540
And I think that you should go home, too.

37:11.410 --> 37:13.490
Because there's
a bad person out here tonight.

37:13.910 --> 37:15.160
- OK?
- OK.

37:15.240 --> 37:17.370
So, go home and lock your door.

37:17.870 --> 37:20.240
And don't let anybody in. Not anybody.

37:20.370 --> 37:21.870
No matter what they say.

37:22.580 --> 37:23.580
OK.

37:30.950 --> 37:32.870
I'm gonna whip you like a step child.

37:33.450 --> 37:35.580
So, Andrea, what are we going to do here?

37:35.660 --> 37:37.830
OK. I am going to teach you
how to drink tequila, right. OK?

37:38.160 --> 37:40.160
- Now, you lick your hand.
- Mmm-hmm.

37:40.240 --> 37:41.240
Come on.

37:41.740 --> 37:43.200
OK, now, dunk it in the salt.

37:43.740 --> 37:44.910
I have my own method.

37:46.410 --> 37:49.540
OK. Now, we're gonna lick the salt
and then down the drink real fast,

37:49.580 --> 37:51.620
- and then take a bite of lemon. OK?
- Mmm-hmm.

37:51.700 --> 37:52.830
- Lick your hand.
- (Video game playing)

37:54.040 --> 37:55.040
Go.

37:56.080 --> 37:57.240
Mmm, lemon.

37:59.240 --> 38:00.240
Phew.

38:01.910 --> 38:02.910
Not too bad, huh?

38:02.950 --> 38:04.410
Mmm. That is gross.

38:05.410 --> 38:06.410
(Artie laughing)

38:07.490 --> 38:09.450
Mmm, tell me what happened
tonight with Terry's brother?

38:09.540 --> 38:11.080
Did you kiss him or what?

38:11.160 --> 38:12.410
No way.

38:13.160 --> 38:15.160
And I felt like a real jerk, too.

38:16.080 --> 38:19.160
At first I thought it was Terry,
but he seemed strange.

38:19.240 --> 38:22.580
Then he came out of the shadow,
and I realized it was his brother.

38:23.080 --> 38:26.040
And he had this really weird look on his face.

38:26.700 --> 38:29.580
And then he told me he's
never kissed a girl before.

38:30.200 --> 38:32.540
Oh. How creepy. Ugh.

38:32.740 --> 38:33.740
(Signs)

38:35.240 --> 38:36.580
Well, I really hope they catch him.

38:37.200 --> 38:38.290
Me, too.

38:38.450 --> 38:39.450
Hey, guys!

38:40.080 --> 38:41.290
(Gregg) Hey, hi. How are ya?

38:42.910 --> 38:45.580
(Andrea) With one of those things
around, you can write off this night.

38:46.790 --> 38:48.740
You girls having a good time back there?

38:48.870 --> 38:52.410
(Andrea) Oh, sure. Just talking about the bad
old days when guys were horny all the time.

38:52.740 --> 38:54.830
Oh, that sounds like my kind of conversation.

38:57.450 --> 38:59.620
(Karen) Hey, um, Artie, I'll take you on.

38:59.700 --> 39:01.580
And I bet you I beat you too.

39:01.620 --> 39:03.540
Come on, Karen. You know you can't beat me.

39:03.620 --> 39:04.950
Ah! That's what you think.

39:05.910 --> 39:07.120
When's my turn?

39:07.200 --> 39:08.620
- When I am finished.
- Hold on, you're going to crash.

39:08.700 --> 39:10.370
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

39:10.410 --> 39:12.620
- No, I'm not.
- You are too!

39:13.120 --> 39:15.330
Oh. You've already crashed.

39:15.990 --> 39:16.990
Too bad.

39:19.580 --> 39:20.790
CrÃ©me de menthe.

39:21.330 --> 39:22.740
(Julia) I'll be right with you, honey.

39:26.790 --> 39:27.870
Wow!

39:28.160 --> 39:29.540
Coconut liqueur.

39:30.540 --> 39:32.080
I've never had coconut liqueur.

39:32.370 --> 39:34.740
What do you do? You take it straight
or on the rocks?

39:35.700 --> 39:38.450
Well, anywhere you like it.

39:40.410 --> 39:41.580
"Not for children."

39:44.490 --> 39:46.240
Silly thing to put on a liquor bottle.

39:46.950 --> 39:48.620
- (Laughing)
- "Not for children."

39:48.990 --> 39:50.620
Of course it's not for children.

39:52.240 --> 39:53.540
Read it again...

40:01.200 --> 40:03.200
Body. Liquor.

40:04.290 --> 40:06.200
I thought you might like an appetizer.

40:22.080 --> 40:26.410
Why don't I just slip into
something more comfortable, hmm?

40:29.740 --> 40:30.990
Sure.

40:44.240 --> 40:45.660
- (Clears throat)
- (Doorbell ringing)

40:45.910 --> 40:47.410
Would you get that, please?

40:48.540 --> 40:49.620
Sure.

40:56.410 --> 40:59.160
- Uh, it's that kid who just left.
- (Sighs)

40:59.240 --> 41:01.040
Well, find out what he wants.

41:05.660 --> 41:06.740
Hi.

41:09.290 --> 41:10.450
- (Record scratches)
- (Baby crying)

41:10.660 --> 41:14.950
Oh. Baby. Shh, shh.

41:16.370 --> 41:18.240
- (Baby crying)
- (Shushes) Honey...

41:22.830 --> 41:26.040
Mamma's gonna get you a rich daddy.

41:45.830 --> 41:47.870
I'll be right there.

41:53.620 --> 41:55.910
Here I am.

41:59.200 --> 42:00.240
(Scoffs)

42:00.330 --> 42:01.370
Bill?

42:01.990 --> 42:03.740
(Knocking on door)

42:14.370 --> 42:16.370
What are you doing out there?

42:17.830 --> 42:20.120
(Screaming)

42:26.080 --> 42:27.240
(Baby crying)

42:34.450 --> 42:35.740
I'm coming, baby.

44:21.990 --> 44:23.080
(Maddy) Terry.

44:25.910 --> 44:26.990
Terry.

45:11.240 --> 45:12.370
Oh, go.

45:12.740 --> 45:13.870
Watch out for that road barrier.

45:13.910 --> 45:16.370
Oh, you almost hit it. Oh my gosh.

45:59.580 --> 46:00.870
What happened?

46:02.490 --> 46:04.290
Too much wine, I think.

46:06.620 --> 46:07.700
Terry.

46:10.330 --> 46:11.370
Yes?

46:12.830 --> 46:14.290
Did they find Todd?

46:16.740 --> 46:18.290
No. Not yet.

46:22.450 --> 46:24.910
Maybe he didn't come here after all.

46:29.990 --> 46:31.790
Maybe he ran away.

46:33.950 --> 46:37.240
Far, far away.

46:40.290 --> 46:41.410
Maybe.

46:45.950 --> 46:47.910
Come give Mamma a kiss.

47:04.450 --> 47:05.450
I really got my eye on this one.

47:05.580 --> 47:06.620
OK. You're gonna crash.

47:06.700 --> 47:08.080
- It's my turn already. Yes you are.
- No, I'm not.

47:08.160 --> 47:09.290
- Here it comes.
- No, I'm not.

47:09.450 --> 47:10.870
Oh, got them.

47:10.910 --> 47:12.240
- (Groans)
- (Laughing)

47:12.330 --> 47:14.580
OK. 90,000 points. That's not too bad.

47:14.660 --> 47:16.490
- (Sighing) I should do better.
- You still did better than me.

47:17.990 --> 47:19.370
It's awful quiet in here.

47:19.410 --> 47:21.370
Yeah, I know. Where did Andrea
and Gregg go?

47:21.410 --> 47:22.450
(Screaming)

47:22.580 --> 47:23.870
What was that?

47:25.910 --> 47:27.240
(Karen) Artie, wait a minute all right?

47:28.330 --> 47:29.330
Be careful, all right?

47:29.990 --> 47:30.990
(Artie) OK.

47:31.240 --> 47:32.240
(Knocking on door)

47:32.950 --> 47:34.120
Hey, Ramsay, you in there?

47:37.620 --> 47:38.740
(Karen) Andrea?

47:40.370 --> 47:41.410
Andrea?

47:46.490 --> 47:47.580
Andrea?

47:48.240 --> 47:49.290
(Screaming)

47:49.950 --> 47:51.330
- Jesus!
- Argh!

47:54.040 --> 47:56.700
(Andrea laughing) Gregg, they thought
the makeup was real.

47:56.830 --> 47:58.080
Ramsay, you asshole.

47:58.870 --> 48:01.240
Jesus. I thought
that Terry's brother got the both of you.

48:01.450 --> 48:04.330
Yeah. So did I.
You guys, that was not funny at all.

48:04.410 --> 48:05.410
Thanks a lot.

48:05.990 --> 48:07.200
Artie, I'm leaving.

48:07.910 --> 48:09.580
- Aw, Karen.
- (Laughing)

48:09.620 --> 48:12.240
Hey, we're going to Mark Johnson's party.
Are you two coming?

48:15.830 --> 48:17.790
(Chuckling)
Andrea wants to play a little tennis.

48:18.540 --> 48:19.580
A little tennis?

48:22.990 --> 48:24.450
(Laughing) Talk to you later.

48:24.540 --> 48:26.700
(Laughing) It worked. I don't believe it!

49:10.450 --> 49:11.580
Oh, shit.

49:12.580 --> 49:15.080
Andrea, that was a dumb thing to do.

49:17.450 --> 49:18.540
(Whistling)

49:25.700 --> 49:28.620
- Gregg honey, I'll be out in a minute.
- OK.

49:31.740 --> 49:33.040
(Whistling)

49:44.410 --> 49:45.450
...in working order?

49:46.580 --> 49:49.080
That number is in working order?

49:49.490 --> 49:51.370
Oh, no. No. That's impossible.

49:51.580 --> 49:53.700
It's impossible. You must have
dialed the wrong number.

49:54.290 --> 49:55.830
No. He's definitely there.

49:55.990 --> 49:59.660
Could you please just recheck that number
for me? Cuz this is a real emergency.

50:01.740 --> 50:02.790
Why not?

50:05.160 --> 50:08.540
Look. Look, look. Look.

50:09.240 --> 50:10.620
You don't seem to understand.

50:11.080 --> 50:13.870
This is a real emergency.

50:14.410 --> 50:16.450
This is a real emergency.

50:16.540 --> 50:18.950
I mean, he's definitely there.

50:19.080 --> 50:23.580
He's waiting for my call right now.
He is sitting there and waiting for my call.

50:24.410 --> 50:26.080
This is very important.

50:28.450 --> 50:30.910
Operator, I am begging you.

50:30.950 --> 50:34.080
This is a real, real emergency.

50:34.120 --> 50:35.700
What's the matter with you?

50:36.160 --> 50:38.200
- Ready?
- I guess.

50:41.290 --> 50:43.080
How do you expect me to hit that?

50:43.580 --> 50:47.410
See, there's this technique in tennis.
It's called swinging your racquet.

50:47.580 --> 50:49.200
I'll swing my racquet.

50:49.370 --> 50:51.910
Come on. Be easy on me.

50:51.990 --> 50:53.080
Ready?

51:09.910 --> 51:10.950
Gregg.

51:26.620 --> 51:28.330
(Gregg) I'm never gonna
drink that tequila again.

51:32.120 --> 51:33.580
Need some help, Andrea?

51:35.580 --> 51:36.580
Oh, God.

51:56.160 --> 51:57.240
You... You all right?

52:01.080 --> 52:02.160
(signing)

52:12.660 --> 52:14.290
Boo! (Laughing)

52:14.910 --> 52:16.330
I couldn't find the ball.

52:17.240 --> 52:20.120
- It's right here.
- Oh. You must be soused.

52:22.660 --> 52:23.740
- Gregg.
- What?

52:24.120 --> 52:25.200
Not here.

52:25.620 --> 52:27.080
I've got a much better idea.

52:33.410 --> 52:34.450
Oh, great.

52:34.540 --> 52:38.740
That's a great idea. That's great.
Oh, operator, thank you so much.

52:39.080 --> 52:41.490
Thank you. Thank you. I really appreciate it.

52:41.910 --> 52:44.660
Thank you very much. Yes, I'll wait. I'll wait.

52:48.740 --> 52:49.790
Hello.

52:51.240 --> 52:52.450
Ah, Well.

52:54.490 --> 52:55.870
The problem is that, um,

52:57.790 --> 53:01.540
my son just escaped from his school.

53:02.410 --> 53:04.410
Well, actually, he ran away.

53:06.200 --> 53:09.740
Actually, it, it's a mental institution.

53:10.620 --> 53:12.990
He ran away from his mental institution.

53:15.410 --> 53:19.910
Now, um, well... Now, I was there
earlier today to bring him his pie.

53:22.620 --> 53:27.120
I always bring him an individual piece of pie

53:27.700 --> 53:31.370
with a little white plastic fork
and a napkin

53:31.830 --> 53:35.990
and I put it in a little box with string

53:39.410 --> 53:40.450
from the bakery.

53:45.700 --> 53:46.740
What?

53:47.830 --> 53:48.870
What?

53:49.830 --> 53:51.370
What number do I want?

53:56.910 --> 53:58.540
Get me my boyfriend.

53:58.910 --> 54:00.990
No, please, get me my boyfriend.

54:24.410 --> 54:25.410
You stop that.

54:26.330 --> 54:27.410
(Screaming)

54:30.240 --> 54:31.450
(Screaming)

54:36.080 --> 54:38.910
(Terry) You're bad, Gregg. Bad.

54:42.200 --> 54:43.200
(Dial tone)

54:44.410 --> 54:45.450
Not now.

54:53.120 --> 54:54.200
Not nice.

54:59.580 --> 55:01.080
Oh, please...

55:03.580 --> 55:06.620
Please don't do this to me.

55:10.120 --> 55:11.910
Please don't.

55:13.580 --> 55:17.290
Please don't leave me alone here.

55:29.490 --> 55:30.580
She started dating him.

55:32.910 --> 55:34.240
Well, anyway she dumped me.

55:35.580 --> 55:36.830
The story of my life.

55:37.910 --> 55:39.120
And I'm a survivor, you know.

55:40.910 --> 55:44.790
Oh. Come on, Artie. You got a few good
years left on that puss of yours.

55:44.870 --> 55:45.910
(Laughing)

55:45.950 --> 55:47.330
Hey, why don't we go to that party?

55:47.410 --> 55:48.740
No. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

55:49.330 --> 55:50.490
That party's not going anywhere.

55:51.040 --> 55:52.080
Let's talk.

55:52.620 --> 55:54.120
Now, what's the story with you and Simmons?

55:54.490 --> 55:56.330
Mmm. Isn't it obvious?

55:56.950 --> 55:59.160
It's like I'm not even around half the time.

56:00.160 --> 56:03.410
Artie, you know, you...
you and I are like best friends.

56:03.580 --> 56:07.620
Do you think maybe you could just talk to
Terry and find out what's going on for me?

56:08.120 --> 56:09.200
Yeah, sure.

56:09.910 --> 56:11.910
- I'll do it.
- Oh, Artie, thanks.

56:12.620 --> 56:13.700
You're a doll.

56:14.240 --> 56:18.040
A doll? You haven't seen my
darker side yet, have you?

56:18.080 --> 56:19.740
(Laughing) You're a turkey.

56:19.990 --> 56:21.410
(Screaming)

56:26.120 --> 56:27.830
Karen, Artie, it's me!

56:27.910 --> 56:30.410
Oh, God damn it, it's Terry.

56:30.490 --> 56:31.540
(Struggling)

56:31.580 --> 56:34.120
- (Laughing)
- You fucking asshole. Shit head.

56:34.910 --> 56:37.240
- Truce. Truce.
- Truce.

56:38.450 --> 56:40.040
I just couldn't resist.

56:40.080 --> 56:42.330
Hey look. I'm sorry about
popping off at you before.

56:42.580 --> 56:43.620
That's all right.

56:44.200 --> 56:45.490
Where's Gregg and Andrea?

56:45.580 --> 56:47.620
- Um, they're out playing tennis.
- Yeah, right.

56:47.700 --> 56:49.160
You know, somebody ought to
tell them to get inside.

56:49.240 --> 56:51.040
Nobody should be out
with my brother around.

56:51.450 --> 56:52.740
Oh, yeah. Right.

56:53.410 --> 56:54.490
I'll tell them.

56:54.790 --> 56:56.370
Hey, and thanks for looking out for my girl.

56:58.290 --> 57:00.410
You're a real sweetheart, Simmons,
you know that?

57:00.450 --> 57:01.540
A real sweetheart.

57:04.120 --> 57:06.290
You know, we haven't had
much of a chance to be alone.

57:06.660 --> 57:08.870
Well, that wasn't my idea.

57:14.830 --> 57:17.370
- Let's go back to my house.
- OK.

57:29.080 --> 57:30.160
Hey. Who are you?

57:30.700 --> 57:31.740
What are you doing in my car?

57:31.910 --> 57:33.450
You're a friend of Terry's, right?

57:34.620 --> 57:36.580
Oh, my God. You're Terry's crazy brother.

57:36.870 --> 57:39.620
No. It's Terry who's crazy.
He's killing people.

57:40.240 --> 57:41.330
Yeah, right.

57:43.410 --> 57:46.120
- You've gotta help me.
- Hey, anything you say!

57:46.200 --> 57:47.700
They call me "Mr. Helper."

57:48.700 --> 57:52.410
Mmm. I was beginning to think
you didn't care any more.

57:53.160 --> 57:54.240
I care.

57:57.830 --> 57:58.870
Mmm.

58:00.120 --> 58:04.200
How come it seems like you've been,
I don't know, sort of distant lately?

58:05.040 --> 58:06.410
Do I seem distant now?

58:07.330 --> 58:08.700
(Laughing) No.

58:11.660 --> 58:13.990
(Artie) Now, listen, Todd.
Straighten yourself out.

58:14.080 --> 58:16.370
- I am all right.
- Just try to stay cool, OK?

58:17.450 --> 58:18.580
It's my place, too.

58:18.740 --> 58:20.080
(indistinct)

58:20.740 --> 58:21.830
Everything will be fine.

58:37.240 --> 58:38.290
(Doorbell ringing)

58:43.540 --> 58:45.240
Terry. Your brother's here.

58:52.790 --> 58:55.080
- He's got to be stopped.
- Yeah, I'm with you.

59:03.740 --> 59:04.790
(signing)

59:12.490 --> 59:13.580
See anything?

59:15.490 --> 59:17.120
- Simmons, get over here.
- What is it?

59:19.410 --> 59:20.450
Take a look at this stuff.

59:24.410 --> 59:25.490
Wow,

59:27.870 --> 59:28.910
a fork.

59:28.950 --> 59:31.200
(Laughing) Be careful with that.

59:32.160 --> 59:33.240
(Laughing)

59:41.330 --> 59:43.040
That isn't cranberry sauce, Artie.

59:45.040 --> 59:47.490
That is not cranberry sauce.

59:50.080 --> 59:51.160
- I see him.
- Where?

59:51.240 --> 59:52.330
- Over there.
- Where?

59:53.700 --> 59:54.950
Where is... Argh!

59:55.330 --> 59:56.410
(Exclaiming)

01:00:09.910 --> 01:00:10.990
Hey, Artie!

01:00:14.330 --> 01:00:15.410
Terry!

01:00:22.370 --> 01:00:23.540
Hey, you guys!

01:00:34.580 --> 01:00:35.740
Where are you guys?

01:00:35.830 --> 01:00:36.870
Terry!

01:00:39.290 --> 01:00:41.080
Oh, come on. Artie!

01:00:42.950 --> 01:00:44.580
It's not cranberry sauce, Artie.

01:00:47.450 --> 01:00:49.040
It's not cranberry sauce.

01:00:49.910 --> 01:00:50.950
(Karen) Terry!

01:00:51.290 --> 01:00:53.620
Hey, Artie! Where are you guys?

01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:56.200
(Gasping)

01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:57.290
Terry.

01:00:57.700 --> 01:00:59.540
What happened? Are you all right?

01:00:59.580 --> 01:01:00.950
Sure, I'm all right.

01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:03.080
What is that thing in your hand?

01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:04.240
It's Todd's.

01:01:04.330 --> 01:01:07.370
He's gone totally out of his mind.
He's killing people all over the complex.

01:01:07.910 --> 01:01:09.410
- Come on. We've got to stop him.
- No.

01:01:09.450 --> 01:01:11.910
Let, let's just go to your house
and call the police.

01:01:11.990 --> 01:01:13.040
Call the police?

01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:16.200
Yes. This thing has gotten totally out of hand.

01:01:16.790 --> 01:01:18.740
You're right. It has gotten totally out of hand.

01:01:18.790 --> 01:01:22.120
That's what we'll do. Call the police,
they'll know what to do. They'll figure it out.

01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:25.290
Karen.

01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:28.080
- (Gasping)
- I love you.

01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:30.580
- (Screaming)
- Did you hear me? I said, "I love you."

01:01:31.580 --> 01:01:32.620
Karen.

01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:37.080
Karen. Where are you going?

01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:39.740
Karen. Karen!

01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:42.370
Karen!

01:01:44.330 --> 01:01:45.410
Andrea!

01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:49.620
Gregg! Help! Help me, please!

01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:51.200
Let me in!

01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:53.240
Gregg!

01:01:56.290 --> 01:01:57.370
Gregg!

01:02:48.580 --> 01:02:51.080
- (Man) <i>Hello.</i>
- Oh, my God. I don't believe it.

01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:53.120
Thank God you're there.

01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:54.950
<i>Wait, wait, wait a minute.
Wait a minute, ma'am.</i>

01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:56.240
<i>Are you sure you got the right number?</i>

01:02:56.290 --> 01:02:58.240
<i>This is 473-7896.</i>

01:02:58.580 --> 01:03:02.040
I'm sorry. I'm... I'm sorry. I must, uh...

01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:04.160
- <i>No problem.</i>
- I must have got the wrong number.

01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:05.240
(Phone clicking)

01:03:07.580 --> 01:03:08.580
(Gasping)

01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:10.290
Oh, my God.

01:03:12.490 --> 01:03:13.540
Oh!

01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:15.410
(Laughing)

01:03:18.990 --> 01:03:21.580
Why? Why are you doing this?

01:03:26.370 --> 01:03:27.410
You're no fun.

01:03:29.620 --> 01:03:30.990
You're no fun at all.

01:03:37.490 --> 01:03:39.450
Hello! Help!

01:03:39.620 --> 01:03:42.080
(Ringing doorbell) I need help really bad.

01:03:42.830 --> 01:03:43.910
Hello?

01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:48.990
Hello!
(Ringing doorbell) ls anybody in there?

01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:50.740
Who is it?

01:03:50.790 --> 01:03:54.580
Oh. Um, I'm Karen Reed
and I'm a friend of your neighbor's.

01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:56.410
And I need help.

01:03:56.490 --> 01:03:57.740
I can't let you in.

01:03:57.950 --> 01:04:01.910
(Stammering) But you don't understand.
I... Please just open the door.

01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:03.330
You have to let me in!

01:04:03.490 --> 01:04:06.080
The man said not to let anyone in.

01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:07.490
Oh, but please!

01:04:07.580 --> 01:04:11.080
There's somebody after me and he's chasing
me and he's trying to hurt me.

01:04:11.410 --> 01:04:12.830
You're gonna hurt my kitty.

01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:14.580
Oh, God.

01:04:18.740 --> 01:04:19.830
Hello.

01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:22.790
Oh, God. Come on.

01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:41.240
Um. I hear your baby crying.

01:04:49.740 --> 01:04:51.700
It's all right. Shh. It's OK.

Come on. Isn't anybody here?

01:04:57.830 --> 01:04:58.910
Hello.

01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:05.240
(Screaming)

01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:10.080
Hi.

01:05:18.830 --> 01:05:19.910
(Exclaiming)

01:05:20.830 --> 01:05:21.910

01:05:43.580 --> 01:05:44.620
Come on.

01:05:49.740 --> 01:05:51.080

01:05:58.870 --> 01:05:59.910
(Baby crying)

01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:07.240
(Terry) Karen, I hear the baby crying.

01:06:07.290 --> 01:06:08.330
(Laughing)

01:06:09.620 --> 01:06:10.700
We're alone now.

01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:12.290
OW!

01:06:19.490 --> 01:06:20.580
(Baby crying)

01:06:25.410 --> 01:06:26.740
Karen, that hurt.

01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:40.160

01:07:50.830 --> 01:07:51.910
Brad.

Brad.

01:07:53.370 --> 01:07:56.580
Brad, help me. Help me.

Why didn't you answer the phone?

01:08:04.910 --> 01:08:07.910
Todd's here! He's been killing again.

01:08:08.990 --> 01:08:10.080

Have you seen Karen?
I don't believe you, guys.

01:10:31.910 --> 01:10:33.290
You would do it anywhere,

on the diving board,

01:10:36.910 --> 01:10:37.950

Get out of the way!

01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:06.660
What? Are you going to try
and shoot me again, Todd?

01:12:10.990 --> 01:12:12.080
I'll kill you.

01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:14.740
I swear I'll kill you.

01:12:19.620 --> 01:12:20.700
(Grunting)

01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:24.450
You've been a bad boy, Todd.
