WEBVTT

00:02.070 --> 00:03.071
Previously on "Chance"...

00:03.171 --> 00:04.605
Dawson Pitt?

00:04.705 --> 00:06.006
Yeah, we know each other?

00:06.107 --> 00:07.041
Not just yet.

00:07.141 --> 00:08.576
(grunts)

00:08.676 --> 00:10.678
How long do you think
it's going to take the cops

00:10.778 --> 00:12.380
to figure out you
and your job

00:12.480 --> 00:15.283
are the common denominator
between these guys?

00:15.383 --> 00:18.018
(woman speaking Spanish)

00:18.119 --> 00:19.420
CHANCE:
I can't get a hold of her.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.355
Probably should have
called back by now.

00:21.455 --> 00:23.791
We're just going to have to make
some changes going forward.

00:23.891 --> 00:25.093
What changes?

00:25.193 --> 00:26.694
Mom, save me, please!

00:26.794 --> 00:28.762
I'm sorry, Nick!

00:28.862 --> 00:31.031
Why did you find me?

00:31.132 --> 00:32.233
You and I should talk.

00:32.333 --> 00:33.734
(choking)

00:33.834 --> 00:35.869
It's the fucking definition
of critical thinking

00:35.969 --> 00:39.073
to look at all that and see that
Ryan Winter killed them all!

00:39.173 --> 00:42.576
For the goddamn-millionth time,
nobody thinks that but you!

00:42.676 --> 00:44.612
(gunshots)

00:44.712 --> 00:46.814
What do you think? Do you
think he had an accomplice?

00:46.914 --> 00:48.149
I don't know.

00:48.249 --> 00:49.983
No more talking
to Dr. Chance.

00:50.084 --> 00:52.553
That is over.

00:52.653 --> 00:54.888
Lieutenant at Richmond Station
had a guy walk in an hour ago,

00:54.988 --> 00:56.624
starts confessing
to multiple murders.

00:56.724 --> 01:00.794
The only person who can fuck
this up right now is you.

01:03.297 --> 01:08.068
**

01:08.169 --> 01:12.840
**

01:12.940 --> 01:17.645
**

01:17.745 --> 01:22.450
**

01:22.550 --> 01:27.288
**

01:27.388 --> 01:32.025
**

01:32.126 --> 01:36.830
**

01:36.930 --> 01:41.635
**

01:41.735 --> 01:46.507
**

01:48.842 --> 01:50.811
(door opens)

01:51.979 --> 01:53.647
(sighs)

01:53.747 --> 01:55.783
**

01:55.883 --> 01:57.851
(sighs)

01:59.387 --> 02:00.954
Hey, boss.

02:01.054 --> 02:02.356
Sorry, sorry.

02:02.456 --> 02:04.892
Shit, Frank!
You scared the shit out of me.

02:04.992 --> 02:06.527
Listen, I would have
called first,

02:06.627 --> 02:09.397
but I figured it was too early
for you to pick up.

02:09.497 --> 02:10.731
I assume
you've heard the news?

02:10.831 --> 02:13.534
About Ryan Winter being
a multiple murderer?

02:13.634 --> 02:15.303
I mean, just when you think
there's nothing left

02:15.403 --> 02:17.070
to this job
that can surprise you.
Yeah.

02:17.171 --> 02:21.809
(sighs) Is that why you're here?
You want it?

02:21.909 --> 02:24.478
I want it so bad I've been
here for two hours,

02:24.578 --> 02:26.146
just in case you decided
to go for a run earlier.

02:26.247 --> 02:27.481
Okay, but we
don't even know

02:27.581 --> 02:28.816
what we're dealing with
here yet, Frank.

02:28.916 --> 02:30.718
Seven counts
of first degree, so far,

02:30.818 --> 02:32.553
and the guy
is still talking.

02:32.653 --> 02:34.188
And I'm hearing he already
told his lawyer

02:34.288 --> 02:36.224
he wants to waive his right
to a prelim trial.

02:36.324 --> 02:37.358
You know what else
I heard?

02:37.458 --> 02:38.992
I heard somebody
from the P.D.

02:39.092 --> 02:41.829
is leaking confession details
to the media.

02:41.929 --> 02:42.930
Listen, this is gonna be
a circus.

02:43.030 --> 02:44.565
Alright, it already is.

02:44.665 --> 02:46.700
So, if at the end of the day
all that ends up happening

02:46.800 --> 02:48.035
is Winter pleads guilty

02:48.135 --> 02:50.238
and we're just jockeying
before the judge

02:50.338 --> 02:52.906
trying to get
the maximum sentence, fine.

02:53.006 --> 02:55.776
But we both know it's
a long road from here to there,

02:55.876 --> 02:58.246
so you are going to feel
a whole lot better

02:58.346 --> 03:02.250
if you got your best person
handling the case, so...

03:04.452 --> 03:07.921
Let me think about it,
Frank, okay?

03:08.021 --> 03:09.089
Absolutely.

03:09.189 --> 03:10.724
I insist on it.

03:10.824 --> 03:13.627
Does your being friends
with Kevin Hynes

03:13.727 --> 03:16.230
have anything to do
with this ask?

03:17.097 --> 03:19.867
Look, everybody was
friends with Hynes once.

03:19.967 --> 03:23.036
Everybody in the P.D. and
everybody from our office.

03:24.137 --> 03:26.106
I'm just the guy
that never stopped.

03:26.206 --> 03:28.809
**

03:28.909 --> 03:30.878
Alright.

03:30.978 --> 03:32.880
I'll tell you
by the end of today.

03:32.980 --> 03:35.316
Thank you.

03:40.153 --> 03:42.390
CHANCE: How are you?
How do you feel?

03:42.490 --> 03:44.558
Tired.

03:46.260 --> 03:50.898
Sort of scraped out
inside, you know?

03:50.998 --> 03:52.966
Yeah.

03:53.066 --> 03:54.668
But I like it.

03:54.768 --> 03:58.406
Things have felt bad
before...and good.

03:58.506 --> 04:00.641
But they've never
felt right.

04:02.743 --> 04:05.346
And this...

04:05.446 --> 04:07.948
doing this, being here,

04:08.048 --> 04:09.283
it feels right.

04:09.383 --> 04:10.751
I talked to Lucy.

04:10.851 --> 04:13.186
She told me
that she'd been seeing you.

04:13.287 --> 04:15.289
That you attacked her,

04:15.389 --> 04:18.759
that you were going to
hurt her, kill her.

04:18.859 --> 04:21.261
I wanted to.

04:21.362 --> 04:22.863
I'm glad I didn't.

04:22.963 --> 04:24.164
You're glad you didn't?

04:24.264 --> 04:26.534
But why didn't you?

04:26.634 --> 04:31.439
I think the question should be
"Why Lucy?" Don't you?

04:33.374 --> 04:37.177
I mean, it was her
at first, at all, because

04:37.277 --> 04:40.448
she was close to you and then
when I found out about you,

04:40.548 --> 04:42.149
I wanted to make you
feel it,

04:42.249 --> 04:43.851
to know
it was your fault.

04:43.951 --> 04:45.319
Found out what about me?

04:45.419 --> 04:47.054
That you're a liar.

04:48.556 --> 04:52.225
You and Detective Hynes, you
were friends, weren't you?

04:52.326 --> 04:54.728
Not at first.

04:54.828 --> 04:57.230
He sent you to the parking lot
that night.

04:57.331 --> 05:01.802
Because I was a monster
and I had to be stopped.

05:02.703 --> 05:06.507
Some part of me knew
from the beginning

05:06.607 --> 05:08.642
that I wasn't seeing all of you,
that you were

05:08.742 --> 05:10.478
holding something back.

05:10.578 --> 05:13.881
And then in the water that day,
with your arm around my neck,

05:13.981 --> 05:15.649
I connected it.

05:15.749 --> 05:17.150
But I shut
the connection down.

05:17.250 --> 05:19.487
I wouldn't let myself
understand what it meant.

05:19.587 --> 05:23.757
I just wanted to believe that
someone wanted to save me,

05:23.857 --> 05:25.926
that you wanted to,

05:26.026 --> 05:28.729
more than I wanted to know
you were lying.

05:31.064 --> 05:34.034
And I was right to do that,
because you...

05:34.134 --> 05:37.004
(chuckles)
you did save me.

05:37.104 --> 05:40.273
You hurt me to save me,

05:40.374 --> 05:42.510
and now here we are.

05:42.610 --> 05:44.011
Here we are.

05:44.111 --> 05:46.046
I know I can't talk
to that woman, your patient,

05:46.146 --> 05:48.248
but I wonder if this is how
it is for her, too.

05:48.348 --> 05:50.451
Peaceful like this.

05:52.420 --> 05:54.254
I hope so.

05:54.354 --> 05:58.792
Grace lies not in the
fulfillment of my desires,

05:58.892 --> 06:01.695
but in the strength to accept
everything with joy.

06:02.930 --> 06:06.600
Who else was there
when Stevie Benjamin died?

06:09.803 --> 06:11.805
What?

06:14.708 --> 06:16.376
What?
-Someone else was there.

06:16.477 --> 06:18.311
Who was it?
-Complicated.

06:18.412 --> 06:20.047
-Was it Lyndsay?
-It's complicated.

06:20.147 --> 06:22.883
But she's not around anymore,
so no one can touch her now.

06:22.983 --> 06:25.753
N-- L-- (sighs)
(door opens)

06:25.853 --> 06:29.056
Lyndsay loved me.

06:29.156 --> 06:30.991
She really did, and I --

06:31.091 --> 06:33.561
No, no, listen,
I was there.

06:33.661 --> 06:34.662
Yeah?

06:34.762 --> 06:37.097
I was,
and I carry that around.

06:37.197 --> 06:39.299
I do.

06:39.399 --> 06:42.570
Well, then,
we're both liars, I guess.

06:42.670 --> 06:45.839
Both wish things
had happened differently,

06:45.939 --> 06:48.509
things were other
than they are.

06:51.178 --> 06:53.313
I lied to you about Hynes.

06:53.413 --> 06:56.083
I told you
another lie, too.

06:56.183 --> 06:59.953
The woman, the patient
you keep talking about.

07:00.053 --> 07:01.489
Her name is Jaclyn.

07:01.589 --> 07:04.958
And I wanted to help her
find peace,

07:05.058 --> 07:08.829
become whole, because
I was in love with her.

07:10.531 --> 07:13.100
But she didn't want that.
She didn't want my help.

07:13.200 --> 07:14.702
She didn't want to
be whole.

07:14.802 --> 07:17.538
I have no idea
where she is now.

07:17.638 --> 07:19.807
So, where we
are now, Ryan,

07:19.907 --> 07:24.478
is uncharted territory
for both of us.

07:26.179 --> 07:28.682
I don't know
what happens next.

07:35.188 --> 07:36.524
(door buzzes)

07:39.192 --> 07:41.829
(door closes)

07:45.699 --> 07:49.369
(door opens, bells jingle)

07:50.704 --> 07:54.407
I drove around Lorena's
neighborhood for some time.

07:54.508 --> 07:58.478
And yes, I parked and waited
for even more time.

07:58.579 --> 08:01.381
I saw nothing that
qualified as suspicious.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.383
I saw nothing at all.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.052
(television plays
indistinctly)

08:05.152 --> 08:07.387
So maybe I was wrong, then.

08:07.487 --> 08:08.822
After she helped us
with the Winter thing,

08:08.922 --> 08:10.824
all the shit that went down.

08:10.924 --> 08:14.094
Maybe she just
wanted to be done.

08:14.194 --> 08:15.929
With you, you mean?

08:17.364 --> 08:20.901
Is that what you think?
Is that what you want?

08:21.001 --> 08:22.903
Did you talk
to her friends?

08:25.005 --> 08:26.439
I don't think
she has any friends.

08:26.540 --> 08:28.676
Don't think
or don't know?

08:28.776 --> 08:30.678
What about her doctor,
the OB-GYN?

08:30.778 --> 08:32.580
Can we call them, see if maybe
she missed an appointment?

08:32.680 --> 08:35.382
**

08:35.482 --> 08:38.552
Favorite restaurants,
perhaps?

08:38.652 --> 08:40.888
They haven't seen her
at the Golden Pagoda.

08:40.988 --> 08:42.255
Alright.

08:44.758 --> 08:46.927
Stores at which she shops?

08:47.027 --> 08:50.030
Walks she takes?
Sights that she likes to see?

08:52.566 --> 08:54.902
Young man, it appears to me
that you have not

08:55.002 --> 08:57.905
conducted this mission with
your usual attention to detail.

08:58.005 --> 09:00.440
-I know.
-Not to worry.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.042
When next you see Lorena --
-If.

09:02.142 --> 09:04.077
When you see Lorena,

09:04.177 --> 09:08.081
ask her these things
and more besides.

09:09.382 --> 09:11.484
She will like that.

09:11.585 --> 09:13.386
I promise you.

09:21.962 --> 09:25.165
NICOLE: Can you at least
tell me where we are?

09:25.265 --> 09:27.901
Or where we're going?

09:33.273 --> 09:35.743
Hey, is this girl
okay back here?

09:35.843 --> 09:37.510
DANA: She will be.

09:41.014 --> 09:43.483
What the...

09:43.583 --> 09:45.653
actual fuck?!

09:47.320 --> 09:48.488
Welcome back, Lexi.

09:48.588 --> 09:50.023
You're kidding me.

09:50.123 --> 09:51.591
-(chuckles)
-Yeah, laugh it up.

09:51.692 --> 09:54.461
Must have been a pretty tough
grab with me passed out,

09:54.561 --> 09:56.797
you fucking degenerate.

09:58.265 --> 10:00.333
I can't believe this shit
is happening again.

10:02.535 --> 10:04.304
And what are you here for?

10:04.404 --> 10:08.308
You look like booze?
Or mommy's pills?

10:10.944 --> 10:12.946
Okay, yeah,
don't tell me.

10:13.046 --> 10:14.514
I'll be bored
to fucking death

10:14.614 --> 10:17.150
hearing about it in group
pretty soon, anyway.

10:17.250 --> 10:18.551
God!

10:18.652 --> 10:19.953
(seatbelt clicks open)

10:20.053 --> 10:21.221
Hot!

10:23.791 --> 10:25.959
TOM:
Put your seat belt back on.

10:26.994 --> 10:29.129
CHANCE:
Hey, Nic, it's me again.

10:29.229 --> 10:30.530
Listen, are you getting
these messages?

10:30.630 --> 10:32.666
Are you trying to tell me
something?

10:32.766 --> 10:34.201
Because
I'm going to ignore it

10:34.301 --> 10:35.736
and just keep calling
until you call me back.

10:35.836 --> 10:38.571
Please, I love you.
Bye.

10:38.672 --> 10:40.808
Staff meeting.

10:43.310 --> 10:45.378
That I absolutely did not
forget about

10:45.478 --> 10:47.247
and am on my way to.

10:48.982 --> 10:51.184
(sighs) You okay?
What's up?

10:51.284 --> 10:54.654
Oh, yeah, just a lot
going on is all.

10:56.089 --> 10:59.860
Gin rummy marathon and pizza
from Pink Onion might help.

10:59.960 --> 11:01.328
Too busy today and tomorrow.

11:01.428 --> 11:04.164
But if I'm still alive
on Thursday, it's a date.

11:04.264 --> 11:05.833
Close the door.

11:05.933 --> 11:08.668
Hi, guys, sorry.

11:08.769 --> 11:10.437
Before we get started,

11:10.537 --> 11:13.106
I have something we all need
to be aware of going forward.

11:13.206 --> 11:15.175
I've been checking in
on a person

11:15.275 --> 11:17.845
we've had an ongoing problem
with, Wade Pardo.

11:17.945 --> 11:20.948
He assaulted Sam Koch
and his boyfriend,

11:21.048 --> 11:23.550
made threats against this place.

11:23.650 --> 11:25.552
It turns out that Wade
was attacked and seriously

11:25.652 --> 11:27.420
injured himself recently.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.689
And so was Anton Spangler
a couple of months ago.

11:29.790 --> 11:32.592
Plus Matty Willis,
who had his arrest voided

11:32.692 --> 11:35.362
on a technicality
after raping Clara Santiago.

11:35.462 --> 11:37.731
He was stabbed
and permanently disabled.

11:37.831 --> 11:41.134
All three of them described
the same attacker,

11:41.234 --> 11:43.436
and this is what
he looks like.

11:45.773 --> 11:48.876
So we got to keep our eyes
and ears open,

11:48.976 --> 11:51.278
figure out if there's
something going on.

11:58.051 --> 12:00.287
-Who's the fat fuck?
-I wouldn't say

12:00.387 --> 12:03.156
it captures your allure.
-So this is just a joke?

12:03.256 --> 12:04.758
That's how we're going to
treat this?

12:04.858 --> 12:07.160
I don't know how your friend
got it to go that far,

12:07.260 --> 12:09.129
but that is as far
as it's going.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.098
I told you.
The cops don't care

12:11.198 --> 12:13.666
about these shitbirds
catching beatdowns.

12:13.767 --> 12:16.669
"The cops don't care enough
to investigate these cases,"

12:16.770 --> 12:18.571
that's your opinion?

12:18.671 --> 12:20.974
The connection between us
and these assaults is a fact.

12:21.074 --> 12:23.410
CARL: The connection
between the assaults

12:23.510 --> 12:24.912
and the face
in that sketch, that's--

12:25.012 --> 12:27.247
-Carl, no, no, that's--
-We stopped, anyway!

12:27.347 --> 12:30.784
We haven't gone after anyone
since that Dawson Pitt guy.

12:30.884 --> 12:34.021
Look, doc, take away
all the arguments we had

12:34.121 --> 12:35.823
about tactics
and methods.

12:35.923 --> 12:37.624
Before she handed you
that drawing,

12:37.724 --> 12:39.793
before you thought we could
be in trouble,

12:39.893 --> 12:42.930
were you sorry we did it?

12:43.030 --> 12:44.297
Uh...

12:44.397 --> 12:46.033
Doc?

12:46.133 --> 12:47.467
I don't know. No.

12:47.567 --> 12:49.002
Then own it!

12:49.102 --> 12:51.138
That is out there.

12:51.238 --> 12:53.306
It exists. There's nothing
I can do about it.

12:53.406 --> 12:55.008
The only things
that matter to me

12:55.108 --> 12:56.609
are things I can
do something about.

12:56.709 --> 12:57.978
Like?

12:58.078 --> 12:59.646
Like finding Lorena.

13:02.715 --> 13:03.951
Lorena?

13:06.519 --> 13:09.022
(sighs) He's worried
she's in trouble.

13:10.557 --> 13:12.659
Winter's confession clears
Ronny Pefaur

13:12.759 --> 13:14.361
of Josefa's murder.
-I mean, I'm glad

13:14.461 --> 13:16.329
Ronny's cleared of something
he didn't do, but...

13:16.429 --> 13:18.731
Well, it's an upsetting
situation for so many reasons.

13:18.832 --> 13:20.167
Right now, I'm mostly
upset

13:20.267 --> 13:21.869
about how this
could reflect on the unit.

13:21.969 --> 13:23.470
Winter being treated here --

13:23.570 --> 13:24.838
Which he was
entitled to be,

13:24.938 --> 13:26.406
just like anyone else
in this city.

13:26.506 --> 13:28.508
-Right.
-I know, but our funding...

13:28.608 --> 13:29.910
Our private donors,
especially,

13:30.010 --> 13:31.478
they don't like
negative attention.

13:31.578 --> 13:34.147
Well, we've got so many charges
against Winter

13:34.247 --> 13:37.350
that my boss might decide not to
bring all the cases to court.

13:37.450 --> 13:39.719
Meaning if we don't bring
Josefa's case,

13:39.819 --> 13:41.989
VOVC won't be under
as much scrutiny.

13:42.089 --> 13:43.891
Has he said anything
about the computers?

13:43.991 --> 13:46.093
Winter upgraded
our computers.

13:46.193 --> 13:49.729
I thought it was generosity,
like the huge check he wrote.

13:49.829 --> 13:51.564
GILYARD: But it was maybe a way
to gain access

13:51.664 --> 13:53.066
to personal info,
medical histories.

13:53.166 --> 13:54.601
-Right.
-Yeah, but why would Winter

13:54.701 --> 13:56.403
need to replace all the
computers to do that?

13:56.503 --> 13:59.839
The only way we're going to be
able to answer that question

13:59.940 --> 14:01.241
is going to make it
pretty hard

14:01.341 --> 14:02.943
for you guys to get any work
done around here.

14:03.043 --> 14:04.344
We got along with our old

14:04.444 --> 14:06.914
computers before,
we can do it again.

14:07.014 --> 14:10.884
Well, I wish I could say we
won't be back for any reason.

14:10.984 --> 14:13.853
It's fine, I understand.
But maybe I can ask a favor?

14:13.954 --> 14:15.688
-Yeah?
-Long story short,

14:15.788 --> 14:17.257
I found out
that several people

14:17.357 --> 14:19.859
who had victimized patients
of ours in the past

14:19.960 --> 14:21.628
have recently been victims
of violent crimes themselves.

14:21.728 --> 14:24.064
Beatings, one was stabbed.

14:24.164 --> 14:27.968
I reported it
to the SFPD, but...
(sighs)

14:33.440 --> 14:35.875
Anton Spangler, Matty Willis,
Wade Pardo.

14:35.976 --> 14:38.645
All three of them describe
their attacker

14:38.745 --> 14:41.314
as a big, bald man
with a neck tattoo.

14:41.414 --> 14:43.716
Yeah, yeah.

14:43.816 --> 14:45.752
That is a big, bald man
with a neck tattoo, alright.

14:45.852 --> 14:47.220
On top of all
this with Winter,

14:47.320 --> 14:48.922
I don't like to think
there might be something

14:49.022 --> 14:51.992
going on that I'm not seeing...
again.

14:52.092 --> 14:55.828
(sighs) Consider it done.
Let's go.

14:55.929 --> 15:01.234
**

15:01.334 --> 15:03.636
Tell you what, I'll write up
the warrant for the hard drives,

15:03.736 --> 15:06.273
and you check on
the big, bald guy.

15:06.373 --> 15:08.275
Oh, fuck that.
You're kidding?

15:08.375 --> 15:10.010
-What?
-Or you want to bang her.

15:10.110 --> 15:12.679
Which is not my problem, so
don't make it my problem, Frank.

15:12.779 --> 15:14.281
It's community
relations, Gilly.

15:14.381 --> 15:16.316
Doing favors builds
relationships.

15:16.416 --> 15:18.851
Getting people to trust you
is a good thing.

15:18.952 --> 15:21.288
Haven't you learned
that by now?

15:23.623 --> 15:29.296
**

15:29.396 --> 15:35.102
**

15:35.202 --> 15:38.038
LEXI: Welcome to paradise.

15:38.138 --> 15:43.710
**

15:43.810 --> 15:50.217
**

15:50.317 --> 15:52.819
BRUCE: We don't have all day,
ladies! Let's go!

15:58.658 --> 16:00.994
Okay, listen up.
My name's Bruce.

16:01.094 --> 16:04.197
I'm a therapist here
at the Wilderness Program.

16:04.297 --> 16:07.634
If you don't know
why you're here...

16:07.734 --> 16:10.503
you'll have plenty of time
to figure that out.

16:10.603 --> 16:11.971
For the next six weeks,

16:12.072 --> 16:15.308
there's no phones,
no frills, no friends.

16:15.408 --> 16:18.645
But at the end,
you'll emerge a changed person.

16:20.413 --> 16:23.983
We'd like to think for the
better, but that's up to you.

16:26.253 --> 16:28.188
Bruce gave you
the pretty version.

16:28.288 --> 16:32.992
But this is about basic
survival, and you will learn it.

16:33.093 --> 16:36.363
Follow the rules,
maybe you'll make it.

16:36.463 --> 16:38.731
Now, groups of four --
we have Burgess, Chance,

16:38.831 --> 16:40.400
Estavez, and Keegan.

16:40.500 --> 16:46.005
Grab your gear in the provisions
cabin, and let's go.

16:46.106 --> 16:47.540
Let's go!

16:47.640 --> 16:50.943
**

16:56.083 --> 17:00.019
Oh, make sure
you check for mold first.

17:03.223 --> 17:04.557
(sniffs)

17:04.657 --> 17:06.526
How many times
you been here?

17:06.626 --> 17:08.628
This is my third.

17:08.728 --> 17:11.198
Or second-and-a-half,
I guess,

17:11.298 --> 17:13.733
since it's not like
I waited for it to be done

17:13.833 --> 17:15.635
before I bailed last time.

17:15.735 --> 17:17.404
What, you ran away?

17:17.504 --> 17:19.939
Got all the way
to the Colony.

17:20.039 --> 17:23.110
The squatter-house in Oakland,
you know it?

17:23.210 --> 17:28.315
No, I ran away like once,
and I went to my dad's, so...

17:28.415 --> 17:30.783
Well, the Colony
is fucking rad.

17:30.883 --> 17:34.087
All kids, artists,
bullshit-free living.

17:34.187 --> 17:36.456
What happened?

17:36.556 --> 17:39.292
I went to Quick Bite
and my uncle saw me.

17:39.392 --> 17:41.494
Now, he said
he wouldn't say anything,

17:41.594 --> 17:43.230
but, well, here I am
telling you

17:43.330 --> 17:45.732
how he said he wasn't going to
say anything, so...

17:47.434 --> 17:49.736
Who sent you?

17:49.836 --> 17:51.971
My mother.

17:52.071 --> 17:53.573
Okay.

17:53.673 --> 17:56.743
Why?
You a little handful?

17:57.477 --> 18:00.747
'Cause she finally saw
the real me, I guess,

18:00.847 --> 18:02.149
and she really
doesn't like her.

18:02.249 --> 18:04.851
TANNER:
We hit the trails in 10.

18:04.951 --> 18:07.954
Use the outhouse, it's your last
chance at any comfort.

18:10.123 --> 18:13.293
(sighs)

18:13.393 --> 18:15.528
DAVENY:
We are formally pleading guilty.

18:15.628 --> 18:17.164
LAMBERT: Great!
I don't necessarily see why

18:17.264 --> 18:18.998
I had to come down
to hear that in person, but I--

18:19.098 --> 18:22.001
And we'll be filing a motion
for a sanity hearing

18:22.101 --> 18:24.371
at the same time.

18:24.471 --> 18:25.505
You're kidding.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.707
We can prove
diminished capacity.

18:29.709 --> 18:32.212
Well, you're going to
have to, Rich, right?

18:32.312 --> 18:36.015
I mean, you do understand that
a diminished capacity plea

18:36.115 --> 18:39.352
completely shifts the burden of
proof off of me and on to you.

18:39.452 --> 18:42.054
You know that, right?
Or maybe you don't?

18:42.155 --> 18:45.024
An act in and of itself doesn't
constitute criminal offense.

18:45.124 --> 18:46.526
Mental state
is just as important --

18:46.626 --> 18:48.495
Okay, how about you get to
lecture me on criminal law

18:48.595 --> 18:51.198
when I get to lecture you
about reading the green

18:51.298 --> 18:53.166
when you're
fucking putting, alright?

18:53.266 --> 18:55.668
-(chuckles)
-And my bo--

18:55.768 --> 18:57.704
my boss is not going to
be happy about this.

18:57.804 --> 19:00.540
Your boss doesn't like
anything, Frank.

19:00.640 --> 19:03.243
We are motioning Monday.

19:03.343 --> 19:06.379
The court will need time
to appoint an expert.

19:06.479 --> 19:08.515
We already have ours,
we just need to find yours.

19:08.615 --> 19:11.050
I'll be fine.
Don't you worry about me.

19:11.150 --> 19:13.653
I just want to know
if your client

19:13.753 --> 19:16.223
understands what
he's getting into.

19:16.323 --> 19:19.592
Do you know the standard of
legal insanity in California,

19:19.692 --> 19:21.594
Mr. Winter, hm?

19:21.694 --> 19:23.663
Do you have any idea
what your lawyer here

19:23.763 --> 19:24.997
is attempting to prove?

19:25.097 --> 19:26.699
What the hell
are you doing, Frank?

19:26.799 --> 19:28.100
I'm okay.

19:28.201 --> 19:30.069
I feel okay.

19:30.870 --> 19:33.072
Great, great!

19:33.172 --> 19:35.342
Because I just want you
to know. Mr. Winter,

19:35.442 --> 19:37.210
that you're going to
have to prove

19:37.310 --> 19:39.912
that at the time that you
committed all those murders,

19:40.012 --> 19:43.516
that you were laboring under
such a defect of reason,

19:43.616 --> 19:45.252
from disease of the mind,

19:45.352 --> 19:48.588
as not to know the nature
and quality of the act.

19:48.688 --> 19:51.958
Basically, that you didn't
understand your actions

19:52.058 --> 19:55.862
any more than would an infant,
a brute, or a wild beast.

19:55.962 --> 19:57.264
But you know what?

19:57.364 --> 20:00.533
I think you did
understand them, Mr. Winter.

20:00.633 --> 20:04.937
In fact, I fucking know
that you did.

20:09.542 --> 20:12.312
I want to talk
to Dr. Chance.

20:17.484 --> 20:19.652
I bet you do.

20:24.223 --> 20:25.758
Okay.

20:28.127 --> 20:30.997
I will call Dr. Chance as soon
as we're out of here.

20:32.098 --> 20:33.900
(line ringing)

20:34.000 --> 20:35.735
-CHRISTINA: Hello?
-Hey, Christina.

20:35.835 --> 20:37.770
Listen, I'm sorry this is

20:37.870 --> 20:39.672
short notice,
but I just can't have

20:39.772 --> 20:41.341
Nic coming over tonight.

20:41.441 --> 20:44.243
Okay, I-I wasn't even
thinking about that. But--

20:44.344 --> 20:47.113
I left her a bunch
of messages, but...

20:47.213 --> 20:49.148
Can you just tell her that
I'll make it up to her?

20:49.248 --> 20:51.183
I'll take her to Marin
this weekend or something.

20:51.284 --> 20:53.620
I can't, Eldon,
I can't tell her that.

20:55.121 --> 20:56.456
Why not?

20:59.592 --> 21:02.862
If this is what you meant
by needing things to change,

21:02.962 --> 21:05.532
this is not
how you do that.

21:06.966 --> 21:09.101
I researched Clearview
thoroughly.

21:09.201 --> 21:11.871
Oh, my God, Christina,
it's a reform school...

21:11.971 --> 21:13.640
-No.
...disguised as therapy camp.

21:13.740 --> 21:15.141
I don't understand --
-It's a reputable place

21:15.241 --> 21:16.643
with a proven
track record.

21:16.743 --> 21:19.211
I don't understand
how they let you do this.

21:19.312 --> 21:20.847
How did they just take her in
without joint consent?

21:20.947 --> 21:22.982
How long have you been
planning this?

21:23.082 --> 21:24.283
What did you do?
You just --

21:24.384 --> 21:25.718
You forge my signature?

21:25.818 --> 21:28.388
Do you remember
Nancy Bart's son Tristan?

21:28.488 --> 21:30.457
Of course, because
he was a meth addict!

21:30.557 --> 21:31.558
That's right,

21:31.658 --> 21:33.159
and she sent him
to Clearview,

21:33.259 --> 21:34.961
and now he's applying to
Northwestern and Princeton.

21:35.061 --> 21:37.330
I don't care where Nicole goes
to college right now

21:37.430 --> 21:38.698
or even if she goes.

21:38.798 --> 21:41.133
Of course, and why wouldn't
I have wanted

21:41.233 --> 21:43.002
to have this discussion
with you?

21:43.102 --> 21:44.704
Well, did you even
consider it?

21:44.804 --> 21:46.506
Did you think maybe
I might have an opinion

21:46.606 --> 21:48.875
about the mental state and
treatment of our daughter?

21:48.975 --> 21:50.677
Of course I did.

21:50.777 --> 21:52.712
I considered it
in light of the conversation

21:52.812 --> 21:54.213
we had the other day.
Is that what this is?

21:54.313 --> 21:56.583
You're getting back at me?
This is not about you!

21:56.683 --> 21:59.051
Or it is because
I don't know who you are!

21:59.151 --> 22:00.987
I can't trust you!
I don't think anyone can!

22:01.087 --> 22:02.389
What you're doing
is not legal.

22:02.489 --> 22:04.223
Okay, so then fight me.

22:04.323 --> 22:07.226
Take me to court. Let's peel
back both our lives.

22:07.326 --> 22:09.996
Let's have a judge decide
who should be in charge

22:10.096 --> 22:13.032
of making decisions in
our child's best interest.

22:13.132 --> 22:16.035
Me or you?

22:16.135 --> 22:18.405
You can let yourself out.

22:29.582 --> 22:30.850
Hey.

22:30.950 --> 22:32.919
Detective Velerio.
How you doing?

22:33.019 --> 22:34.353
Carl Allan.

22:34.454 --> 22:37.356
Can I help you
with something, detective?

22:37.457 --> 22:39.426
-Call me Sid.
-Alright, Sid.

22:39.526 --> 22:41.260
I asked these guys
to let me know

22:41.360 --> 22:43.463
if someone came for Kevin,
Detective Hynes.

22:43.563 --> 22:45.297
You guys were friends?

22:45.398 --> 22:48.435
Not of long standing,
but yes.

22:48.535 --> 22:52.104
We met under complicated
circumstances,

22:52.204 --> 22:54.273
but I liked him immediately.

22:54.373 --> 22:56.576
He was an old soul.

22:58.611 --> 23:01.080
You were friends, too,
obviously?

23:01.180 --> 23:04.083
Yeah, for a long time.

23:04.183 --> 23:06.419
He was my mentor
first, though.

23:06.519 --> 23:08.320
Taught me
how to do my job.

23:08.421 --> 23:10.657
I would've washed out
without him.

23:12.091 --> 23:15.227
I paid him back for that by
treating him like fucking shit.

23:15.327 --> 23:17.464
I'm sure you didn't.
I did, though.

23:17.564 --> 23:18.965
And to top it off, the last time
that I saw him,

23:19.065 --> 23:22.401
I basically bum-rushed him
out of the building.

23:23.636 --> 23:25.271
He tell you
about Ryan Winter?

23:25.371 --> 23:27.173
He did.

23:27.273 --> 23:31.911
And now, apparently,
everyone else knows, too.

23:32.011 --> 23:35.748
Will that vindicate Kevin,
do you think?

23:35.848 --> 23:37.484
Absolve his memory?

23:37.584 --> 23:39.519
If I have anything
to do with it, it will.

23:39.619 --> 23:41.320
I don't care if I have to go
door-to-door

23:41.420 --> 23:42.922
to every cop in the Bay Area.

23:43.022 --> 23:44.491
(chuckles)

23:44.591 --> 23:48.528
You gonna have a...
funeral or...?

23:48.628 --> 23:50.663
Uh, cremation.

23:52.499 --> 23:54.300
Maybe we should
take his ashes

23:54.400 --> 23:56.335
to a bar and have a few pops
with him sometime.

23:56.435 --> 23:57.937
(laughs)

23:58.037 --> 24:00.006
In memoriam.

24:00.106 --> 24:04.210
I think he would
like that very much.

24:06.846 --> 24:09.015
Okay, well.

24:11.984 --> 24:13.520
Whenever he's ready.

24:13.620 --> 24:15.154
You're alright, Sid.

24:15.254 --> 24:17.356
Carl.

24:17.456 --> 24:20.527
Pleasure.

24:20.627 --> 24:22.795
LAMBERT: I just wanted
to ask if it was you.

24:24.997 --> 24:27.066
Is what me?
Are you their expert

24:27.166 --> 24:29.135
on Winter's
diminished capacity?

24:29.235 --> 24:31.037
Or, I should say,
one of their experts?

24:31.137 --> 24:34.206
Case this big, there's probably
more than one, right?

24:34.306 --> 24:36.342
Honestly, I don't feel
comfortable discussing this.

24:36.442 --> 24:38.477
Nothing's official
at this point, anyway.

24:38.578 --> 24:41.981
I get it.
I guess, you know,

24:42.081 --> 24:43.716
I feel like I'm
playing catch-up here.

24:43.816 --> 24:46.519
And I know you've been
with the guy from the jump.

24:46.619 --> 24:49.055
I just wanted to take
your temperature about it.

24:49.155 --> 24:51.858
You know, forewarned is
forearmed, and all that.

24:51.958 --> 24:54.894
But, hey, I did not mean

24:54.994 --> 24:58.230
to make you feel
uncomfortable, seriously.

24:58.330 --> 25:01.500
And sorry I even
had you come over here.

25:01.601 --> 25:02.835
I'll tell you what.

25:02.935 --> 25:04.436
You don't have to tell me
anything,

25:04.537 --> 25:06.105
and I'd like to offer you
a drink.

25:06.205 --> 25:08.174
Sure.

25:08.274 --> 25:10.910
Generally speaking, yeah,

25:11.010 --> 25:14.747
I believe that Ryan Winter
suffers from several severe

25:14.847 --> 25:16.949
and distinct
personality disorders.

25:17.049 --> 25:19.018
Okay.

25:19.118 --> 25:21.954
Well, do you think
his disorders

25:22.054 --> 25:24.557
grossly disturb his capacity
to understand reality?

25:24.657 --> 25:28.227
Did they cause severely,
legally relevant impairments

25:28.327 --> 25:29.461
at the time
of his crimes?

25:29.562 --> 25:31.197
Feeling uncomfortable again.

25:31.297 --> 25:33.866
Okay, thought I'd try.

25:33.966 --> 25:37.937
But, I am ready to say,
off the record, between us,

25:38.037 --> 25:41.140
that wherever
Winter winds up,

25:41.240 --> 25:43.976
he needs dedicated
psychiatric care.

25:44.076 --> 25:46.445
Back on the record, the way our
legal system handles

25:46.545 --> 25:50.416
mental illness is Byzantine at
best and cruel and unusual

25:50.516 --> 25:53.986
at worst.
Well, I, uh, sort of

25:54.086 --> 25:57.289
occasionally and unofficially
think so, too.

25:57.389 --> 25:59.458
Don't tell my boss.
(chuckles)

25:59.558 --> 26:02.428
HYNES: Mendota, 1990.

26:02.528 --> 26:05.564
13-year-old boy killed,
case still open.

26:05.665 --> 26:07.133
Maybe Winter
didn't kill Stevie,

26:07.233 --> 26:08.801
or maybe
he didn't kill him alone.

26:08.901 --> 26:11.270
Well, that's enough
fucking salad.

26:13.105 --> 26:14.841
Oh! Hey,
I offered you a drink

26:14.941 --> 26:16.909
and then I totally
didn't get you one.

26:17.009 --> 26:19.812
What an asshole.
Look at that.

26:19.912 --> 26:21.681
Somebody ganked
my other glass.

26:21.781 --> 26:23.282
Fucking...
well, you know what?

26:23.382 --> 26:26.118
Probably left it
in the coffee room sink.

26:26.218 --> 26:29.321
Hold that thought.
I'll be right back.

26:29.421 --> 26:31.090
(door opens)

26:31.190 --> 26:37.329
**

26:37.429 --> 26:43.602
**

26:43.703 --> 26:48.941
**

26:49.041 --> 26:54.280
**

26:54.380 --> 26:59.618
**

26:59.719 --> 27:01.688
Crisis averted.

27:03.522 --> 27:06.826
You know what?
I-I should probably get going.

27:06.926 --> 27:09.228
You know, it's...

27:11.063 --> 27:14.033
What the hell?
One for the road.

27:15.234 --> 27:16.235
Cheers.

27:16.335 --> 27:17.737
Cheers.

27:25.978 --> 27:28.748
Mendota, 1991.

27:28.848 --> 27:31.918
Same time, same ages.

27:32.018 --> 27:34.086
It all lines up.
(Carl humming)

27:34.186 --> 27:37.724
The doc figured out
who that DNA belongs to.

27:37.824 --> 27:39.325
Maybe.

27:39.425 --> 27:41.493
Hynes' friend, guy
who works in the DA's office.

27:41.593 --> 27:44.096
Never rains,
but it pours, huh?

27:44.196 --> 27:46.532
Have you braced
Winter about this yet?

27:46.632 --> 27:49.235
Winter's been transferred
to county jail.

27:49.335 --> 27:51.437
He's isolated from
the general population,

27:51.537 --> 27:54.707
he gets three one-hour visits
a week besides his attorney.

27:54.807 --> 27:56.442
I'm seeing him Thursday.

27:56.542 --> 27:58.778
Meantime, I got this.

27:58.878 --> 28:01.013
This was in Lambert's mouth.

28:01.113 --> 28:02.514
(sniffs)

28:02.614 --> 28:04.717
Smells like ranch.
The question is,

28:04.817 --> 28:06.786
who can help us with it?
Who'd want to?

28:06.886 --> 28:08.354
Not to mention,

28:08.454 --> 28:10.289
if this Lambert catches wind,
we're fucked.

28:10.389 --> 28:11.758
I guess I could go
to Mendota police,

28:11.858 --> 28:14.226
just throw myself on the mercy
of whoever Hynes

28:14.326 --> 28:15.427
was talking to
when he was there.

28:15.527 --> 28:18.364
I think
I might know someone.

28:18.464 --> 28:20.266
A recent acquaintance.

28:20.366 --> 28:22.902
One whose karma
is in need of repair.

28:25.537 --> 28:28.140
What would you think of this
if you were ashes?

28:28.240 --> 28:29.475
Hmm?

28:29.575 --> 28:31.778
I think I would love it.

28:31.878 --> 28:35.547
JODI: Stroke the bow around the
spindle back and forth quickly.

28:35.647 --> 28:37.917
MAYA:
This isn't working.

28:38.017 --> 28:40.119
It's going to take some time.
You'll have to keep at it.

28:42.454 --> 28:45.091
-Get closer to the sawdust.
-Do we really have to do this?

28:45.191 --> 28:46.893
You can eat
raw food and freeze.

28:46.993 --> 28:48.427
Your choice.

28:49.595 --> 28:51.397
Faster.

28:51.497 --> 28:54.100
(blowing)

28:54.200 --> 28:55.267
Aah.

28:55.367 --> 28:57.269
(sighs)

28:59.839 --> 29:01.808
Great.

29:15.187 --> 29:16.322
Here.

29:16.422 --> 29:17.924
How the hell did
you do that so quick?

29:18.024 --> 29:19.291
This usually takes me hours.

29:19.391 --> 29:21.193
Just lucky, I guess.

29:21.293 --> 29:23.095
Oh, okay.

29:27.099 --> 29:28.801
(line ringing)

29:28.901 --> 29:31.537
WOMAN: The customer's voice
mailbox is full.

29:41.180 --> 29:43.682
(door opens, bells jingle)

29:48.020 --> 29:49.721
Hi.

29:49.822 --> 29:51.623
What do you want?

29:51.723 --> 29:54.293
I don't want anything,
I swear.

29:54.393 --> 29:55.962
I'm just the messenger.

29:56.062 --> 29:57.964
From who?
Your father.

29:58.064 --> 30:00.967
My father who said
he would leave me the fuck alone

30:01.067 --> 30:02.468
from now fucking on.

30:02.568 --> 30:04.837
Is what he said you'd say.

30:04.937 --> 30:07.139
And he told me to tell you
that's still true.

30:07.239 --> 30:09.842
He also wanted me to give you
something.

30:11.643 --> 30:13.145
It's in my bag.

30:13.245 --> 30:15.314
I'm gonna take it out now.
Please don't

30:15.414 --> 30:18.017
do anything.

30:20.686 --> 30:21.587
Put it there.

30:21.687 --> 30:24.190
Okay.

30:24.290 --> 30:26.658
What is it?
I don't know.

30:26.758 --> 30:29.195
He just said
that you should have it.

30:29.295 --> 30:30.762
That it's yours.

30:30.863 --> 30:32.331
Awesome.

30:32.431 --> 30:35.935
Now get a move on,
while you can still move.

30:42.441 --> 30:45.177
(cellphone vibrates)

30:47.679 --> 30:48.847
Lorena?

30:48.948 --> 30:50.749
You okay?

30:50.849 --> 30:52.618
Where are you?

30:52.718 --> 30:55.587
I'm coming.

31:00.292 --> 31:01.961
Detective Velerio?

31:02.061 --> 31:03.795
(indistinct conversations)

31:03.896 --> 31:06.432
Yeah?
I'm Dr. Eldon Chance.

31:06.532 --> 31:08.600
Carl Allan
gave me your name.

31:08.700 --> 31:11.803
I wanted to talk
about Kevin Hynes.

31:11.904 --> 31:14.140
What about him?
He was my friend.

31:14.240 --> 31:15.441
And I think he was
yours, too.

31:15.541 --> 31:16.608
Not when it counted,

31:16.708 --> 31:17.743
but yeah.

31:17.843 --> 31:19.045
Why?

31:19.145 --> 31:21.113
Well,
I'm a neuropsychiatrist.

31:21.213 --> 31:23.815
I was helping Kevin
look into Ryan Winter.

31:23.916 --> 31:24.984
Okay.

31:28.620 --> 31:30.722
He thought there might be
an accomplice.

31:30.822 --> 31:31.924
What?

31:32.024 --> 31:33.625
Nobody said anything
about that,

31:33.725 --> 31:35.461
including Winter
from what I hear.

31:35.561 --> 31:38.064
Where the fuck
does that idea come from?

31:38.164 --> 31:41.400
**

31:41.500 --> 31:43.135
(keys rattle)

31:43.235 --> 31:45.137
(door clanks)

31:47.573 --> 31:50.142
What's going on?

31:50.242 --> 31:53.145
Are those my clothes?

31:53.245 --> 31:55.747
They said...

31:55.847 --> 31:58.184
**

31:58.284 --> 32:00.452
I thought I had to wear
this now.

32:00.552 --> 32:02.088
Don't know.

32:02.188 --> 32:04.156
Guess somebody's
looking out for you.

32:04.256 --> 32:07.093
Okay.

32:07.193 --> 32:09.161
CHANCE: Victim's name
was Stevie Benjamin.

32:09.261 --> 32:10.862
He was 13.

32:10.963 --> 32:15.667
Mendota PD pulled DNA
from under his fingernails

32:15.767 --> 32:17.003
that's still being stored.

32:17.103 --> 32:18.470
How do you know that?

32:18.570 --> 32:20.872
Which will match
the DNA on this fork.

32:20.973 --> 32:24.643
The DNA that you say comes
from Winter's accomplice?

32:24.743 --> 32:26.378
Does it come with a name?

32:28.447 --> 32:30.149
Will you please
just run this

32:30.249 --> 32:32.118
against the Stevie Benjamin
case?

32:32.218 --> 32:34.386
If it's a match,
I'll tell you the name then.

32:34.486 --> 32:37.689
What's the matter?

32:37.789 --> 32:40.192
You scared or something?

32:40.292 --> 32:42.128
What are you scared of?

32:44.530 --> 32:48.534
Wait, do I keep on
the socks I'm wearing or...?

32:51.237 --> 32:54.206
(grunting)

33:14.560 --> 33:16.762
Please, just do this.

33:16.862 --> 33:19.231
**

33:19.331 --> 33:21.333
Fuck it. I owed him.

33:21.433 --> 33:22.534
I'll do it, fine.

33:22.634 --> 33:23.702
Thank you.

33:23.802 --> 33:25.037
I'm not doing it for you.

33:25.137 --> 33:26.272
No, I know.

33:26.372 --> 33:28.674
I'm doing it for Kev,
not you.

33:28.774 --> 33:31.577
I get kind of a hinky vibe
off you, doc.

33:31.677 --> 33:35.181
**

33:35.281 --> 33:39.251

33:39.351 --> 33:43.755
**

33:43.855 --> 33:48.260
**

33:48.360 --> 33:52.798
**

33:52.898 --> 33:57.303
**

33:57.403 --> 34:02.441
**

34:02.541 --> 34:04.810
(door clangs shut)

34:09.548 --> 34:10.882
Alright,
so I fucked up.

34:10.982 --> 34:12.551
Listen, Maya,
it's not a big revelation,

34:12.651 --> 34:15.887
but the more you're able to be
honest with yourself,

34:15.987 --> 34:17.623
the more other people
will respect you.

34:18.790 --> 34:20.626
Alright, who's next?

34:20.726 --> 34:22.494
Nicole, you've been
pretty quiet.

34:22.594 --> 34:24.096
Got a letter here
from your mom.

34:24.196 --> 34:25.931
You don't need the letter.

34:26.031 --> 34:28.834
There was this girl.
I thought she was my friend.

34:28.934 --> 34:30.969
And I found out she was
spreading shit about me

34:31.069 --> 34:34.740
all over the Internet,
so I broke her nose with a book.

34:34.840 --> 34:38.444
I'm not sorry. And I don't like
this game. Or this place.

34:38.544 --> 34:41.680
I'm a straight-"A" student,
not a drug addict.

34:41.780 --> 34:43.449
But I would do what put me here
again in a hot minute.

34:43.549 --> 34:46.318
Okay, so you believe
the punishment fit her crime?

34:46.418 --> 34:48.120
Your former friend?

34:48.220 --> 34:50.256
Yep.
So, violence was the answer?

34:50.356 --> 34:52.291
Is the answer?

34:52.391 --> 34:53.692
Well, if it means
making things right...

34:53.792 --> 34:56.428
Making things right.
Hm.

34:56.528 --> 34:58.797
What does that mean to you,
making things right?

34:58.897 --> 35:00.466
Does that mean
she should apologize?

35:00.566 --> 35:03.835
Take everything back, promise
she'll never do it again?

35:03.935 --> 35:05.971
So, is that what happened
after you broke her nose?

35:06.071 --> 35:10.276
Did she, uh,
make things right?

35:10.376 --> 35:12.678
Well, you tell me what you think
I should have done then.

35:12.778 --> 35:14.380
Just eat it?

35:14.480 --> 35:16.848
What about what she did?
-What about it?

35:16.948 --> 35:18.850
This is not the last time
something like this

35:18.950 --> 35:20.886
is going to happen to you
or to any of us.

35:20.986 --> 35:23.289
Terrible, painful,
unjust shit

35:23.389 --> 35:25.191
will happen again
and again and again.

35:25.291 --> 35:26.858
And the only part of any of it

35:26.958 --> 35:31.129
that you will ever be able to
control is how you react.

35:31.230 --> 35:34.166
You'd do what you did again
in a hot minute,

35:34.266 --> 35:35.634
that's what you said.

35:35.734 --> 35:37.869
But you said it to me here,
in this place.

35:37.969 --> 35:39.871
And that girl,
whatever her name is?

35:39.971 --> 35:45.244
She's at home, eating hot food
and sleeping in a bed.

35:45.344 --> 35:47.078
You're here.

35:48.347 --> 35:50.749
LORENA:
I have to leave soon.

35:50.849 --> 35:53.051
It's bad for Paloma
that I'm here.

35:53.151 --> 35:54.853
Los Cazadores must've
been looking for me

35:54.953 --> 35:56.722
right from the start if going to
one stupid job agency

35:56.822 --> 35:58.890
let them figure out
where I was.

35:58.990 --> 36:01.660
How hard's it gonna be for them
to find me now?

36:04.830 --> 36:07.933
I sold the car that Winter
gave me to Paloma's son,

36:08.033 --> 36:10.101
so that should be enough
for bus fare

36:10.202 --> 36:12.371
to get somewhere
far enough from here.

36:12.471 --> 36:14.506
-Like where?
-I don't know.

36:14.606 --> 36:17.843
Gonna decide at the last minute.
Keep it loose.

36:17.943 --> 36:19.411
(dog barking)

36:19.511 --> 36:21.747
This guy who's
looking for you...

36:21.847 --> 36:23.181
It's the baby's father.

36:23.282 --> 36:25.717
Yeah, him.

36:25.817 --> 36:27.753
He have a name?

36:27.853 --> 36:31.257
(children shouting)

36:31.357 --> 36:32.791
Hector Ibarra.

36:32.891 --> 36:36.928
Los Cazadores call him
El Martillo, "The Hammer".

36:37.028 --> 36:40.632
I could -- I could tell you why,
but it's disgusting.

36:42.468 --> 36:46.372
Well, you basically
just did tell me, so...

36:47.406 --> 36:49.875
Me, he doesn't care about.

36:49.975 --> 36:52.210
He wants the baby.

36:54.580 --> 36:56.748
Any way
that he can get him.

36:58.250 --> 37:00.752
I can take care of Hector.

37:04.490 --> 37:07.125
I know that you think
that you can,

37:07.225 --> 37:09.561
but even if you did,
it doesn't work like that.

37:09.661 --> 37:11.096
-I don't care how it works.
-Los Cazadores,

37:11.196 --> 37:14.566
they make people pay, okay?
But they pay, too.

37:14.666 --> 37:16.402
There's always somebody
getting paid.

37:16.502 --> 37:21.273
Here or there or -- it doesn't
matter, and you can't change it.

37:21.373 --> 37:24.443
You can't stop it, so you better
not get in the way of it.

37:24.543 --> 37:26.478
Not by killing Hector.
Not at all.

37:29.147 --> 37:32.017
(dog barking)

37:32.117 --> 37:35.020
You're a good man.

37:35.120 --> 37:37.323
But I'll be okay, okay?

37:37.423 --> 37:39.024
Just have to hide again.

37:39.124 --> 37:42.193
This time long enough
for Hector to get tired.

37:42.294 --> 37:44.162
(dog barking)

37:44.262 --> 37:47.299
I know you think so,

37:47.399 --> 37:49.435
but even if you could,

37:49.535 --> 37:51.470
that's not how it works.

37:54.473 --> 37:56.375
(indistinct conversations)

37:56.475 --> 37:58.344
(sighs)

38:03.682 --> 38:06.552
Deputy Sheriff Thomas.

38:06.652 --> 38:09.955
Dr. Eldon Chance. I'm
Ryan Winter's psychiatrist.

38:10.055 --> 38:12.658
We're supposed to have
a one-hour session --
Dr. Chance,

38:12.758 --> 38:17.195
your patient committed
suicide last night.

38:17.295 --> 38:19.130
Are you sure?

38:19.230 --> 38:21.900
He used his own socks,
soaped the floor first,

38:22.000 --> 38:24.002
so, yeah, we are.

38:24.102 --> 38:26.004
Did he leave a note?

38:26.104 --> 38:27.673
No, he did not.

38:28.674 --> 38:31.209
D: If it makes you feel any
better, Lambert had probably

38:31.309 --> 38:34.212
been cooking it up since he
found out Winter confessed.

38:34.312 --> 38:35.881
(sighs)

38:35.981 --> 38:39.718
What about any of this
can make anyone feel better?

38:39.818 --> 38:42.388
Unless the coroner's report.
It might show something.

38:42.488 --> 38:44.423
Injuries sustained
before death.

38:45.657 --> 38:47.593
Wouldn't count on it.

38:47.693 --> 38:51.430
End of the day, Lambert took
care of him like a boss.

38:51.530 --> 38:54.400
And saved the city and state
millions of dollars.

38:54.500 --> 38:56.668
That's all anyone will be
thinking about.

38:56.768 --> 38:58.704
You talked to
that Detective Velerio?

38:58.804 --> 39:01.440
With, uh, yeah,
I -- yeah.

39:01.540 --> 39:03.375
He said
he's going to do it.

39:05.711 --> 39:08.914
What's your deal?

39:13.251 --> 39:17.456
Winter was sure that he was
going to a psychiatric hospital

39:17.556 --> 39:21.059
because I told him
that's where Jaclyn had gone

39:21.159 --> 39:24.195
after she
confessed to murder.

39:24.295 --> 39:28.266
Then the last time I saw him,
I admitted it was a lie, so...

39:28.366 --> 39:30.135
If it's easier for you
to believe

39:30.235 --> 39:33.605
that Winter committed suicide
because of something you said

39:33.705 --> 39:35.541
rather than that
he was murdered

39:35.641 --> 39:38.810
so he couldn't dump Lambert
in the shit, well...

39:39.778 --> 39:44.149
...I'm not going to tell you
to get over yourself.

39:44.249 --> 39:46.585
But you should.

39:46.685 --> 39:50.989
(indistinct conversations)

39:51.089 --> 39:52.491
Thank you.

39:56.161 --> 39:58.396
What's your deal?

39:59.731 --> 40:01.066
Is it Lorena?

40:01.166 --> 40:04.570
Carl said you found her.
Is everything okay?

40:05.937 --> 40:07.473
Not yet.

40:07.573 --> 40:11.009
**

40:11.109 --> 40:15.113
**

40:15.213 --> 40:16.782
(door opens)

40:18.950 --> 40:20.952
(door closes)

40:21.052 --> 40:26.291
**

40:26.391 --> 40:31.697
**

40:31.797 --> 40:37.168
**

40:41.372 --> 40:43.141
(knock on door)

40:46.444 --> 40:48.780
Right.
We had a plan.

40:48.880 --> 40:50.549
I'm sorry, I...

40:50.649 --> 40:51.717
Come on in.

40:51.817 --> 40:53.985
It was my plan too, so...

40:54.085 --> 40:55.954
I'm an idiot.

40:56.054 --> 40:59.024
If I remember, we said
we were going to -- to pizza.

40:59.124 --> 41:03.294
You want to still do that, or
you got something else in mind?

41:03.394 --> 41:05.196
Did you already know
you were going to do this

41:05.296 --> 41:07.065
when I hired you,
or did you think about it after,

41:07.165 --> 41:11.236
like a reaction
to the pressures of the job?

41:11.336 --> 41:15.306
Did you look at
all the fear around you,

41:15.406 --> 41:17.475
the pain, the randomness,

41:17.576 --> 41:23.549
and think, "I'm gonna become
a fucking vigilante"?

41:23.649 --> 41:26.251
You and your henchman.

41:26.351 --> 41:28.754
Your big, bald hitman

41:28.854 --> 41:32.323
who crippled Matty Willis
and Wade Pardo

41:32.423 --> 41:34.492
and almost killed
Anton Spangler.

41:34.593 --> 41:36.327
-Kristen, plea--
-No!

41:38.396 --> 41:40.699
You cannot believe
that I would ever hurt you.

41:40.799 --> 41:43.034
I don't know what you'll do.

41:43.134 --> 41:46.705
You want me to explain?
I don't know how a doctor

41:46.805 --> 41:48.907
whose calling --
no, whose responsibility it is

41:49.007 --> 41:50.942
to heal can explain this?!

41:55.280 --> 41:58.016
You have risked everything
I've worked for my whole life.

41:58.116 --> 42:00.418
The clinic I built,
the community.

42:00.518 --> 42:01.753
That was not my intention.

42:01.853 --> 42:04.890
The only hope
for all these people

42:04.990 --> 42:07.759
whose lives were almost
destroyed, and for what?

42:07.859 --> 42:10.796
For those people.

42:10.896 --> 42:13.531
For them.
For Clara Santiago.

42:14.933 --> 42:16.735
What are
you talking about?

42:16.835 --> 42:19.705
Clara is not afraid
anymore.

42:19.805 --> 42:22.307
She can sleep at night.

42:22.407 --> 42:24.209
She's starting to heal,
she's starting to trust.

42:24.309 --> 42:26.778
Because you hurt
the man who hurt her?

42:26.878 --> 42:28.379
Yes.

42:28.479 --> 42:31.717
Because you turned him
into a victim?

42:31.817 --> 42:33.251
Your victim?
-What about us?

42:33.351 --> 42:37.455
Who helps us when we sit
in so much misery

42:37.555 --> 42:40.959
that it starts to leak out
around the edges?

42:41.059 --> 42:42.994
Don't tell me you haven't
felt the weight of that.

42:43.094 --> 42:45.831
Of course I do.
That's when I go somewhere

42:45.931 --> 42:49.500
and sit on a beach and thank
my lucky fucking stars.

42:49.601 --> 42:52.137
I'm not talking about burnout.
I'm talking about

42:52.237 --> 42:54.840
a fundamental shift
in psyche.

42:56.742 --> 42:59.344
There are no excuses,
there's only reasons.

42:59.444 --> 43:02.614
It's only a threshold,
after which I cannot sit

43:02.714 --> 43:08.486
and inhale my patients' pain
without doing something,

43:08.586 --> 43:10.421
without at least
breathing it out.

43:10.521 --> 43:12.023
So, yeah,
I breathed it out.

43:12.123 --> 43:14.325
And in that breath
was fire.

43:14.425 --> 43:16.361
And I liked it.

43:16.461 --> 43:20.531
I thought because we weren't in
love that I saw you clearly.

43:20.632 --> 43:23.869
But you have always been this
person and I never even noticed.

43:25.103 --> 43:28.506
I just handed my respect
and trust

43:28.606 --> 43:33.378
and my patients over because I
assumed they'd be safe with you.

43:33.478 --> 43:35.113
Patients are safe with me.

43:35.213 --> 43:38.850
No! Stop saying that!
Stop justifying this.

43:41.820 --> 43:43.388
(footsteps receding)

43:43.488 --> 43:44.823
(door opens)

43:44.923 --> 43:48.393
I'll have somebody
pack your office.

43:48.493 --> 43:51.129
Don't come back
to the unit.

43:51.229 --> 43:52.798
Not ever again!

43:52.898 --> 43:58.036
**

43:58.136 --> 44:03.408
**

44:09.815 --> 44:11.149
Merry Christmas.

44:11.249 --> 44:12.183
(shells rattle)

44:12.283 --> 44:14.485
Oh, shit.

44:14.585 --> 44:16.354
Black Talon nines?

44:18.356 --> 44:20.826
They discontinued these.
How'd you find them?

44:20.926 --> 44:23.428
I'm a magic magician.

44:23.528 --> 44:26.531
They come with strings.

44:26.631 --> 44:29.868
Barrio Cazadores,
you know 'em?

44:29.968 --> 44:31.569
Fuck, yeah.

44:31.669 --> 44:33.538
They're the bad shit.
Why?

44:33.638 --> 44:36.274
Someplace local they hang?

44:37.575 --> 44:41.579
You might find some
at that gun range off 680.

44:41.679 --> 44:44.182
Maybe a couple at Romero's
on the southside.

44:44.282 --> 44:47.953
Where's their place?

44:48.053 --> 44:50.789
La Cerve, off 16th,
but...

44:50.889 --> 44:52.023
don't go there.

44:52.123 --> 44:54.225
Okay?

44:55.426 --> 44:57.796
(indistinct conversations)

45:04.102 --> 45:06.571
Hey.
You got any more room?

45:06.671 --> 45:08.874
Sure.

45:15.413 --> 45:16.815
Here.

45:19.317 --> 45:20.886
Hey, I'll be right back.

45:20.986 --> 45:22.788
Okay.

45:25.723 --> 45:27.392
Hey.

45:27.492 --> 45:30.228
I just...
I wanted to apologize.

45:31.329 --> 45:33.164
That's unnecessary,
but thanks.

45:33.264 --> 45:36.835
What you said last night, my
former friend, her mom told her

45:36.935 --> 45:38.436
basically the same thing once.

45:38.536 --> 45:40.839
Consider the worst
possible consequence

45:40.939 --> 45:42.941
and if you can live with it
before you act.

45:43.041 --> 45:44.509
And that made
a lot of sense to me.

45:44.609 --> 45:46.177
Well, we all struggle

45:46.277 --> 45:48.313
with remembering that, Nicole.
I have, too, you know.

45:48.413 --> 45:51.316
Taking responsibility is
how we turn things around.

45:51.416 --> 45:55.620
That, and remembering to let
other people help us.

45:55.720 --> 45:57.488
Bruce.
Ride's here.

45:57.588 --> 46:00.191
JODI: Alright, we're leaving
in 10 minutes.

46:00.291 --> 46:01.659
Grab your packs.

46:01.759 --> 46:04.595
Anyone that needs to use
the bathroom, go now.

46:04.695 --> 46:06.932
Make sure you put
those fires out.

46:30.655 --> 46:34.159
**

46:34.259 --> 46:38.296
**

46:38.396 --> 46:39.697
(knock on door)

46:41.332 --> 46:43.501
Hey.
Hey.

46:43.601 --> 46:44.735
You know how I was
looking into that

46:44.836 --> 46:47.005
big, bald bad guy
thing for you?

46:47.105 --> 46:49.574
That VOVC goodwill thing?
Yeah?

46:49.674 --> 46:50.741
I did a deep dive
into their computers.

46:50.842 --> 46:52.377
Went into
their patient lists.

46:52.477 --> 46:54.579
I started making some phone
calls off-the-record.

46:54.679 --> 46:56.514
Well, you're not going to
fucking believe

46:56.614 --> 46:57.883
what I found out.

46:59.384 --> 47:01.887
(rap music plays)

47:01.987 --> 47:06.557
**

47:06.657 --> 47:11.229
**

47:11.329 --> 47:15.867
**

47:15.967 --> 47:20.538
**

47:20.638 --> 47:25.376
**

47:25.476 --> 47:27.913
Hey, dumb shit,
that's our Dumpster.

47:28.013 --> 47:30.882
Sorry, man.
Just looking for some food.

47:33.618 --> 47:35.620
That's our food,
dumb shit.

47:35.720 --> 47:36.888
(grunts)

47:39.857 --> 47:41.292
Hector Ibarra?

47:41.392 --> 47:42.293
You --

47:42.393 --> 47:44.195
El Martillo, you know him?

47:44.295 --> 47:45.396
You expecting him here?
When?

47:45.496 --> 47:46.731
-Hey!
-Where is he?

47:46.831 --> 47:48.066
Hey!

47:48.166 --> 47:49.867
(groans)

47:49.968 --> 47:52.770
You gonna cut that donkey's
throat or what?

47:52.870 --> 47:54.739
You're supposed to be
the doorman.

47:54.839 --> 47:56.607
How you gonna be
a doorman

47:56.707 --> 47:58.643
if you can't watch
the fucking door?

48:01.646 --> 48:03.814
And you?
Asking about El Martillo?

48:03.915 --> 48:05.316
Fuck you, too.

48:05.416 --> 48:06.918
Lorena.

48:07.018 --> 48:08.753
Lorena?
What about her?

48:11.289 --> 48:13.458
First I speak with Hector.

48:13.558 --> 48:16.161
(chuckles)
First no knife, big guy.

48:22.167 --> 48:23.134
(knife clatters)

48:23.234 --> 48:25.803
Good. Good.

48:25.903 --> 48:26.972
(stun gun crackles)

48:28.573 --> 48:29.941
(grunts)

48:32.577 --> 48:35.981
We have joint custody!
She does not have the legal --

48:37.482 --> 48:39.317
She does not have
the legal right

48:39.417 --> 48:42.787
to send our child out of
the state without my consent.

48:42.887 --> 48:44.689
Now, will you put Nicole
on the phone, please?

48:44.789 --> 48:46.591
Well, then, you drive out there,
you get her,

48:46.691 --> 48:47.692
and put her on the phone!

48:47.792 --> 48:49.427
Or you know what, I will!

48:49.527 --> 48:52.663
I will drive up there with
my lawyer right fucking now!

48:58.703 --> 49:00.671
Dr. Chance?

49:00.771 --> 49:03.541
Sir, I'm Detective Lacey,
this is Detective Mendez,

49:03.641 --> 49:06.211
San Francisco police.
Can we talk to you, please?

49:06.311 --> 49:07.678
Talk to me about what?

49:07.778 --> 49:09.047
If its's okay with you,

49:09.147 --> 49:11.282
we'd rather do it
at Bayview Station.

49:11.382 --> 49:13.451
Well, no, it's not okay.

49:13.551 --> 49:15.120
Am I under arrest?

49:15.220 --> 49:17.455
You can be if you want.

49:18.556 --> 49:19.790
On what charge?

49:19.890 --> 49:21.626
The aggravated assault
and battery

49:21.726 --> 49:22.893
of a man named Dawson Pitt.

49:22.994 --> 49:24.662
Okay?

49:24.762 --> 49:27.132
So, what's it going to be?

49:27.232 --> 49:29.134
**

49:29.234 --> 49:30.868
Sir?

49:37.675 --> 49:40.045
(rapping indistinctly)

49:40.145 --> 49:44.749
**

49:44.849 --> 49:49.520
**

49:49.620 --> 49:54.225
**

49:54.325 --> 49:58.929
**

49:59.030 --> 50:01.532
(rapping in Spanish)

50:01.632 --> 50:06.404
**

50:06.504 --> 50:11.242
**

50:11.342 --> 50:16.081

50:16.181 --> 50:20.951

50:21.052 --> 50:25.856
