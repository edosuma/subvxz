WEBVTT

00:01.769 --> 00:02.803
HEY.

00:02.803 --> 00:04.572
HEY, HONEY.

00:04.572 --> 00:07.641
DAD, I'M GONNA HANG OUT WITH
MY FRIENDS ON FATHER'S DAY,

00:07.641 --> 00:09.777
SO IS IT OKAY IF I GIVE YOU
YOUR GIFT NOW?

00:09.777 --> 00:12.813
IS IT ANOTHER HUMIDOR
MADE OUT OF A SHOE BOX?

00:12.813 --> 00:14.115
BECAUSE I REALLY LOVE

00:14.115 --> 00:17.618
WHEN MY CIGARS
TASTED LIKE YOUR FEET.

00:17.618 --> 00:20.921
NO, I DIDN'T WANT TO MAKE YOU
SOME JUNKY KID GIFT THIS YEAR,

00:20.921 --> 00:22.723
SO I WROTE YOU A LETTER,

00:22.723 --> 00:25.726
YOU KNOW, TO TELL YOU
HOW I FEEL ABOUT YOU.

00:25.726 --> 00:29.830
VERY NICE, VERY TOUCHING.
NO ENVELOPE.

00:29.830 --> 00:31.299
ANGIE, CAN YOU GRAB

00:31.299 --> 00:33.267
YOUR MOTHER'S DAY LETTER
OFF THE FRIDGE?

00:33.267 --> 00:35.903
I THINK THEY'RE THE SAME.

00:35.903 --> 00:37.571
THEY'RE TOTALLY DIFFERENT.

00:37.571 --> 00:38.739
READY?

00:38.739 --> 00:41.442
YEAH.
"DEAR MOTHER...
"DEAR FATHER...

00:41.442 --> 00:43.844
"THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING
YOU DO FOR ME...
"THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING
YOU DO FOR ME...

00:43.844 --> 00:46.147
"ESPECIALLY FIXING MY LUNCH.
"ESPECIALLY FIXING MY BIKE.

00:46.147 --> 00:48.482
"THIS LETTER
COMES FROM MY HEART...
"THIS LETTER
COMES FROM MY HEART...

00:48.482 --> 00:51.352
"WHICH IS MUCH MORE BETTER...
"WHICH IS MUCH MORE BETTER...

00:51.352 --> 00:56.290
"THAN ANYTHING I COULD HAVE
BOUGHT AT THE GOLF STORE...
"THAN ANYTHING I COULD HAVE
BOUGHT AT THE PURSE
STORE...

00:56.290 --> 01:00.294
YOUR SON, MAX."
YOUR SON, MAX."

01:00.294 --> 01:03.631
"YOUR SON, MAX"?
THAT'S... (speaks Spanish)

01:03.631 --> 01:06.434
I GET A NICER CHRISTMAS CARD
FROM THE MAILMAN.

01:06.434 --> 01:09.437
I KNOW HE'S LOOKING FOR A TIP,
BUT AT LEAST HE SIGNS IT,

01:09.437 --> 01:11.272
"LOVE, HECTOR. X-X-O-O."

01:14.175 --> 01:15.576
OH, UNCLE GEORGE,

01:15.576 --> 01:17.945
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THIS WATCH?

01:17.945 --> 01:19.613
OH, MAN, THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.

01:19.613 --> 01:22.616
I'VE BEEN SAVING UP
FROM MY PART-TIME JOB FOR MONTHS

01:22.616 --> 01:25.619
SO I COULD AFFORD THIS.
IT'S MY FATHER'S DAY GIFT.

01:25.619 --> 01:28.656
OH, VERONICA, I MEAN,
THIS IS... TOO MUCH. THANK YOU.

01:28.656 --> 01:31.625
I MEAN, I KNOW I'M YOUR UNCLE,
BUT WHEN YOU DO STUFF LIKE THIS,

01:31.625 --> 01:34.662
IT MAKES ME REALIZE
THAT WE REALLY ARE FAMILY NOW.

01:34.662 --> 01:38.166
WHAT ARE YOU GOING ON ABOUT?
THIS IS FOR MY DAD.

01:38.166 --> 01:40.634
YOUR DAD IS A CRIMINAL
WHO RAN OUT ON YOU.

01:40.634 --> 01:42.636
THAT'S WHY
YOU'RE LIVING WITH ME.

01:42.636 --> 01:45.639
I KNOW, BUT HE'S STILL MY DAD,
AND IT'S FATHER'S DAY.

01:45.639 --> 01:48.108
MY GIFT SHOWS
HOW MUCH I LOVE HIM.

01:48.108 --> 01:49.710
HEY, SUPERBOY.

01:51.879 --> 01:53.181
ARE YOU HEARING THIS?

01:53.181 --> 01:54.582
YEAH.

01:54.582 --> 01:56.584
OKAY,
THEN I'M GIVING YOU

01:56.584 --> 01:58.586
A 1-WEEK EXTENSION
ON FATHER'S DAY, OKAY?

01:58.586 --> 02:00.521
NEXT SUNDAY, I BETTER
FEEL LIKE YOU LOVE ME.

02:00.521 --> 02:03.391
Â¿SABES QUÃ©?
TOTALLY ENGULFED IN LOVE.

02:03.391 --> 02:05.793
AND DON'T SAY
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY

02:05.793 --> 02:08.862
BECAUSE YOU CAN SELL SOMETHING,
SO MAKE IT HAPPEN, CAP'N.

02:08.862 --> 02:11.532
THANKS A LOT.

02:11.532 --> 02:13.801
I'M NOT EVEN ATTRACTED
TO YOU ANYMORE.

02:16.870 --> 02:19.240
ALL RIGHT. IT'S BACK.

02:21.074 --> 02:24.345
I AM SO SORRY YOU
MISUNDERSTOOD ME, UNCLE GEORGE.

02:24.345 --> 02:26.146
LOOK,
I WILL MAKE IT UP TO YOU.

02:26.146 --> 02:29.016
I WILL GET YOU SOMETHING
EVEN BETTER ON UNCLE'S DAY.

02:29.016 --> 02:30.684
UNCLE'S DAY? WHEN IS THAT?

02:30.684 --> 02:34.922
OH, THIS YEAR IT FALLS
ON FEBRUARY... (mutters)

02:34.922 --> 02:36.890
HELLO,
MY LITTLE ANGEL.

02:36.890 --> 02:38.659
HEY, DADDY.

02:38.659 --> 02:40.828
HOW WAS
THE MEDICAL CONFERENCE?

02:40.828 --> 02:42.330
OH, FANTASTIC.

02:42.330 --> 02:43.631
WE HAD A GREAT SPEECH

02:43.631 --> 02:45.833
ON THE NEXT GENERATION
OF ARTIFICIAL HEART,

02:45.833 --> 02:48.369
AND THEN WE WENT OUT
FOR STEAKS AND CIGARS

02:48.369 --> 02:51.272
AND DANCED WITH YOUNG HOTTIES
UNTIL DAWN. HMM?

02:51.272 --> 02:52.573
WHAT THE HELL?

02:52.573 --> 02:54.808
NEW HEARTS
ARE ON THE WAY, RIGHT?

02:56.544 --> 02:58.546
ARE NEW TONGUES
ON THE WAY, TOO?

02:58.546 --> 03:00.814
BECAUSE I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND
A DAMN WORD YOU SAID.

03:00.814 --> 03:03.083
(imitating Vic) "WE DANCED
WITH HOTTIES UNTIL DAWN.

03:03.083 --> 03:06.720
AND WHAT THE HELL?
(speaks gibberish)"

03:06.720 --> 03:09.290
I AM BEYOND YOUR INSULTS,
MIJO.

03:09.290 --> 03:12.260
I GOT THE PHONE NUMBER
OF A 21 YEAR OLD.

03:12.260 --> 03:13.694
THAT'S RIGHT.

03:13.694 --> 03:17.831
SHE BROKE OUT THE DIGITS
FOR HER CUBAN DADDY. HMM?

03:17.831 --> 03:19.733
UGH!

03:19.733 --> 03:23.471
DID YOU CALL THE NUMBER
TO SEE IF IT WAS REAL?

03:23.471 --> 03:26.407
AY, GEORGE, PLEASE. IT'S NOT
THE KILL. IT'S THE HUNT.

03:26.407 --> 03:29.577
(under breath)
IT WAS FAKE, WASN'T IT?

03:29.577 --> 03:32.513
(under breath)
OH, YEAH, MAN, BIG-TIME.

03:32.513 --> 03:35.082
BUT IF YOU EVER NEED
AUTO PARTS IN PALMDALE,

03:35.082 --> 03:37.585
I GOT THE NUMBER.

03:37.585 --> 03:39.620
ARE YOU STAYING
FOR DINNER?

03:39.620 --> 03:42.456
NO, I JUST CAME OVER
TO ASK GEORGE SOMETHING.

03:42.456 --> 03:43.757
MY HOSPITAL IS HAVING

03:43.757 --> 03:45.759
A FATHER/SON
GOLF TOURNAMENT TOMORROW.

03:45.759 --> 03:47.795
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE
TO PLAY WITH ME?

03:47.795 --> 03:51.865
NO, VIC, I DON'T EVER WANT
TO PLAY GOLF WITH YOU

03:51.865 --> 03:53.301
EVER AGAIN IN MY LIFE.

03:53.301 --> 03:54.735
WHY NOT?

03:54.735 --> 03:57.004
BECAUSE EVERYTHING
IS A BIG PRODUCTION TO YOU,

03:57.004 --> 03:59.640
AND IT TAKES FOREVER
FOR YOU TO LINE UP A SHOT.

03:59.640 --> 04:02.376
(imitating Vic) OKAY. COME HERE.
LET'S SEE WHAT I GOT GOING.

04:07.180 --> 04:10.318
(speaking Spanish and gibberish)

04:11.652 --> 04:15.556
LOOK, BEFORE YOU SAY "NO"
FOR SURE,

04:15.556 --> 04:18.258
I HAVE A SURPRISE FOR YOU
IN THE CAR.

04:20.861 --> 04:23.831
HONEY, I THINK THIS
MEANS MORE TO MY DAD

04:23.831 --> 04:26.033
THAN JUST WINNING
A GOLF TOURNAMENT.

04:26.033 --> 04:27.668
HE WANTS
TO PLAY WITH YOU

04:27.668 --> 04:29.670
BECAUSE HE THINKS
OF YOU AS A SON.

04:29.670 --> 04:31.939
LOOK, ANGIE,
HE'S GOT A SON.

04:31.939 --> 04:34.975
YEAH, AND THEY DON'T EVEN SPEAK
ANYMORE, AND IT KILLS HIM.

04:34.975 --> 04:37.611
THAT'S WHY HE'S REACHING OUT
TO YOU ON FATHER'S DAY.

04:37.611 --> 04:41.749
THIS COULD BE A VERY EMOTIONAL
DAY FOR YOU TWO.

04:41.749 --> 04:42.850
LISTEN TO ME.

04:42.850 --> 04:46.787
I PLAY GOLF
TO ESCAPE EMOTION, OKAY?

04:46.787 --> 04:48.389
IT'S FIVE HOURS--

04:48.389 --> 04:50.724
NO KIDS, NO WIFE.

04:50.724 --> 04:53.794
IT MUST BE
WHAT HEAVEN IS LIKE.

04:56.364 --> 05:00.434
SO IN YOUR HEAVEN,
THERE'S NO WIFE?

05:00.434 --> 05:01.802
ANGIE, IT'S HEAVEN.

05:01.802 --> 05:03.904
I ONLY PROMISED TILL DEATH.
SELFISH.

05:03.904 --> 05:06.907
LOOK IT, I'M NOT SAYING
I'M-A IGNORE YOU UP THERE.

05:06.907 --> 05:09.910
IF I SEE YOU AT THE GATES,
I'M-A SAY HELLO TO YOU.

05:09.910 --> 05:12.245
OR IN THE GARDEN,
YOU'RE WALKING BY LIKE THAT,

05:12.245 --> 05:14.382
I'LL BE LIKE,
"EH, WHAT'S UP?"

05:14.382 --> 05:17.618
LOOK, I KNOW FATHER'S DAY
MEANS A LOT TO YOU

05:17.618 --> 05:19.620
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T
HAVE A DAD.

05:19.620 --> 05:21.589
LOOK HOW UPSET YOU WERE
ABOUT WHAT MAX DID.

05:21.589 --> 05:23.591
JUST THINK HOW GREAT
IT WOULD BE

05:23.591 --> 05:27.361
IF YOU AND MY DAD HAD
A MORE FATHER/SON RELATIONSHIP.

05:27.361 --> 05:29.363
LOOK, ANGIE, I DON'T NEED
A DAD NOW, OKAY?

05:29.363 --> 05:31.331
LOOK, I TAUGHT MYSELF
HOW TO FIX CARS,

05:31.331 --> 05:33.133
I TAKE MYSELF
TO THE DODGER GAMES

05:33.133 --> 05:35.603
AND WHEN I DO SOMETHING GOOD
AND I FEEL PROUD,

05:35.603 --> 05:39.840
I GIVE MYSELF ONE OF THESE--
"GOOD JOB, SON. TOP NOTCH."
GEORGE, THAT'S REALLY SAD.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.842
IS IT?
WELL, WHEN IT'S SAD,

05:41.842 --> 05:43.911
THEN IT CALLS
FOR ONE OF THESE--

05:43.911 --> 05:45.145
"CHIN UP, SON.

05:45.145 --> 05:46.880
STIFF UPPER LIP."

05:48.348 --> 05:51.852
FINE. IF YOU WON'T PLAY GOLF
WITH MY DAD FOR YOURSELF,

05:51.852 --> 05:54.888
WOULD YOU AT LEAST
DO IT FOR ME? PLEASE.

05:54.888 --> 05:56.690
ALL RIGHT. FINE!

05:56.690 --> 05:58.859
BUT WHEN YOU SEE ME
IN HEAVEN,

05:58.859 --> 06:00.994
AND I'M LEANING ON A WING
LIKE THAT,

06:00.994 --> 06:04.264
AND I'M TALKING TO A GIRL,
YOU BETTER BE COOL WITH IT.

06:04.264 --> 06:06.800
OF COURSE
I'LL BE COOL WITH IT,

06:06.800 --> 06:10.804
BECAUSE I'LL BE ON MY OWN CLOUD
WITH HECTOR THE MAILMAN.

06:10.804 --> 06:12.773
WHAT?!

06:12.773 --> 06:16.844
THE "X-X-O-O"
WAS FOR ME, FOOL.

06:19.547 --> 06:21.248
OKAY, VIC,

06:21.248 --> 06:24.117
LOOK,
I CHANGED MY MIND, MAN.

06:24.117 --> 06:25.786
I'LL PLAY WITH YOU
IN THE GOLF TOURNAMENT.

06:25.786 --> 06:27.788
MIJO,MIJO,
THAT'S FANTASTIC!

06:27.788 --> 06:31.124
OKAY, LOOK, BUT HERE ARE
THE GROUND RULES, ALL RIGHT?

06:31.124 --> 06:34.027
NONE OF THAT, ALL RIGHT?
NO KISSING, NO SLAPPING MY BUTT

06:34.027 --> 06:36.497
AND NO SALSA DANCING
IF YOU MAKE A LONG PUTT.

06:36.497 --> 06:39.299
(imitates Vic) OH,
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU MADE IT.

06:39.299 --> 06:41.301
(normal voice)
NONE OF THAT,

06:41.301 --> 06:43.103
'CAUSE YOU'RE GONNA
EMBARRASS ME.

06:43.103 --> 06:44.271
FINE,

06:44.271 --> 06:48.375
AND HERE ARE THE SHIRTS
WE ARE GOING TO WEAR.

06:48.375 --> 06:52.646
WHATEVER. DO WHATEVER YOU WANT,
I'LL EMBRACE IT.

06:54.782 --> 06:57.918
(War's "Low Rider" playing)

07:01.622 --> 07:03.491
* ALL MY FRIENDS

07:03.491 --> 07:06.860
* KNOW THE LOW RIDER

07:08.662 --> 07:10.230
* THE LOW RIDER

07:10.230 --> 07:13.534
* IS A LITTLE HIGHER

07:13.534 --> 07:17.037
**

07:27.314 --> 07:28.716
HEY.

07:28.716 --> 07:29.817
HUH?

07:29.817 --> 07:31.619
THANKS FOR BEING
OUR CADDIE TODAY, MAN.

07:31.619 --> 07:34.855
I DON'T THINK I COULD TAKE FIVE
HOURS OUT HERE ALONE WITH VIC.

07:34.855 --> 07:37.558
HEY, IT'S GONNA BE FUN, MAN.
YOU KNOW, WE'LL HAVE A CIGAR,

07:37.558 --> 07:39.459
HAVE SOME BEERS,
BUT DON'T WORRY.

07:39.459 --> 07:42.195
I'M GONNA STAY SOBER ENOUGH
TO DRIVE THE LITTLE CART.

07:42.195 --> 07:43.997
THERE'S NO CART.

07:43.997 --> 07:46.767
WHAT? I'M GONNA HAVE TO CARRY
YOUR BAGS FOR 18 HOLES?

07:46.767 --> 07:49.402
DUDE, I HAVE FLUID
IN MY KNEES.

07:49.402 --> 07:51.271
YOU'RE NOT JUST
CARRYING OUR BAGS.

07:51.271 --> 07:52.706
THE CADDIE IS IMPORTANT.

07:52.706 --> 07:55.175
YOU HELP ME WITH CLUB SELECTION,
COURSE MANAGEMENT,

07:55.175 --> 07:58.612
READING THE GREEN'S
UNDULATIONS, TAMBIÃ©N.

07:58.612 --> 08:00.413
OH, OKAY. OKAY, WELL,
NOW I GOT A PURPOSE.

08:00.413 --> 08:03.751
ALL RIGHT. CHECK IT OUT. THIS
FIRST HOLE IS A DOGLEG RIGHT.

08:03.751 --> 08:05.686
I WOULD STRONGLY--

08:05.686 --> 08:08.656
Ã³RALE, BAGGER VANCE.
I GOT IT.

08:10.423 --> 08:12.793
(under breath) OH, MAN.
I HATE THIS GUY--ANTHONY TOVAR.

08:12.793 --> 08:16.830
HE'S THE MOST ARROGANT
ANESTHESIOLOGIST IN THE WORLD.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.832
GOOD TO SEE YOU,
DR. PALMERO.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.834
THIS IS MY SON,
DR. TONY TOVAR,

08:20.834 --> 08:23.470
HEAD OF SPORTS MEDICINE
AT ST. LUKE'S.

08:23.470 --> 08:26.473
THIS IS
MY SON-IN-LAW GEORGE.

08:26.473 --> 08:29.643
HE'S A VERY IMPORTANT MAN
IN THE AERONAUTICS INDUSTRY.

08:29.643 --> 08:32.980
OH, REALLY? WHO ARE YOU WITH?
UH, LOCKHEED? BOEING? J.P.L.?

08:32.980 --> 08:34.982
(clears throat)
I GOT OFFERS FROM ALL OF 'EM,

08:34.982 --> 08:37.184
BUT I CHOSE THIS PLACE CALLED
POWERS BROTHERS AVIATION.

08:37.184 --> 08:39.186
THEY'RE BIG. UNLESS
YOU'RE IN THE INDUSTRY,

08:39.186 --> 08:41.388
Â¿SABES QUÃ©? YOU NEVER
WOULD HAVE HEARD OF IT.

08:41.388 --> 08:42.890
WAIT,
I'VE DRIVEN BY THAT FACTORY.

08:42.890 --> 08:44.491
IT'S IN PANORAMA CITY BETWEEN

08:44.491 --> 08:48.228
THE, UH, LIQUOR STORE AND THAT,
UH, CHECK CASHING PLACE.

08:48.228 --> 08:51.198
SINCE WE'RE INVOLVED
WITH GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS,

08:51.198 --> 08:54.902
I CAN NEITHER CONFIRM NOR DENY
THAT INFORMATION.

08:54.902 --> 08:57.771
OH, WELL, WELL,
ENOUGH OF THE CHITCHAT.

08:57.771 --> 09:00.741
IT'S TIME TO GRIP IT
AND RIP IT.

09:14.487 --> 09:16.690
OH, QUE LA!

09:23.797 --> 09:25.899
JEEZ. I THINK I LOST IT
IN THE SUN.

09:25.899 --> 09:28.802
YEAH, HEY, VIC,
THE SUN DROPPED IT, MAN.

09:28.802 --> 09:31.639
IT'S RIGHT THERE
ON THE GRASS.

09:31.639 --> 09:35.442
(speaking Spanish)

09:35.442 --> 09:36.977
EXCUSE ME.

09:36.977 --> 09:40.147
THE MEN
ARE HITTING NOW.

09:41.949 --> 09:44.084
HEY, TONY.
(laughs)

09:44.084 --> 09:47.087
I DON'T WANT TO GET
IN YOUR HEAD OR ANYTHING,

09:47.087 --> 09:49.222
YOU KNOW, PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT,

09:49.222 --> 09:52.425
HEY, BUT DO YOU BLINK BEFORE
OR AFTER YOU HIT IT?

09:52.425 --> 09:55.195
I DON'T KNOW.
ASK YOUR WIFE.

10:05.038 --> 10:08.942
GREAT SHOT, SON.
THAT'S MY BOY.

10:08.942 --> 10:11.078
YEAH,
THAT'S A LONG SHOT,

10:11.078 --> 10:14.114
WHICH IS WHAT MY WIFE WOULD SAY
IF YOU TRIED TO HIT HER BECAUSE

10:14.114 --> 10:17.885
Â¿SABES QUÃ©? SHE'S NOT INTO ALL
THIS GLAMOUR, PRETTY BOY STUFF.

10:17.885 --> 10:19.586
WELL,
THAT'S OBVIOUS.

10:19.586 --> 10:21.889
DAMN IT.

10:21.889 --> 10:23.824
RICH, HANDSOME
AND FUNNY--

10:23.824 --> 10:26.093
IT'S GONNA BE
A LONG DAY FOR YOU.

10:26.093 --> 10:28.696
SHOW THEM
WHAT YOU GOT.

10:28.696 --> 10:31.631
HERE'S YOUR BIG DOG.
LET HER BARK.

10:41.274 --> 10:42.976
WAAPAHH!

10:44.778 --> 10:46.780
SOMEBODY BETTER CALL
SOCIAL SERVICES,

10:46.780 --> 10:49.482
'CAUSE THAT BALL
JUST GOT SPANKED.

10:49.482 --> 10:51.484
YOU OUT-DROVE HIM
BY 20 YARDS.

10:51.484 --> 10:52.720
GOOD JOB, SON!

10:52.720 --> 10:54.888
AND THAT IS MY BOY.

10:56.824 --> 10:59.359
(big-band swing music playing)

10:59.359 --> 11:02.796
* GO, BIG DADDY

11:02.796 --> 11:06.133
* GO, BIG DADDY

11:06.133 --> 11:07.567
* HEY

11:07.567 --> 11:08.769
* GO

11:08.769 --> 11:11.271
**

11:35.328 --> 11:37.998
NICE PUTT.

11:38.866 --> 11:40.600
ALL RIGHT.
LAST HOLE.

11:40.600 --> 11:41.935
YOU'RE UP BY 3.

11:41.935 --> 11:45.105
ALL YOU GOTTA DO IS 2-PUTT THIS,
AND YOU WIN.

11:45.105 --> 11:48.708
HUH. AND IT'S ALL BECAUSE
OF THIS KID RIGHT HERE.

11:48.708 --> 11:51.011
MM. OH, WE ARE GONNA
WIN THAT TROPHY,

11:51.011 --> 11:53.680
AND IT'S NOT GONNA SAY
"TOVAR AND SON."

11:53.680 --> 11:55.916
IT'S GONNA SAY
"PALMERO AND SON."

11:55.916 --> 11:58.451
HMM, GEORGE?
I'M REALLY PROUD OF YOU.

11:58.451 --> 12:01.454
YOU HEAR THAT, MAN?
HE'S PROUD OF ME.

12:01.454 --> 12:04.024
NO ONE'S EVER SAID THAT TO ME
EXCEPT FOR ANGIE,

12:04.024 --> 12:06.726
AND SHE SAYS IT TO MAX,
SO YOU KNOW IT MEANS NOTHING.

12:06.726 --> 12:09.863
HEY, WHY WOULDN'T HE
BE PROUD OF YOU, MAN?

12:09.863 --> 12:12.565
YOU'RE A GOOD GUY.
YOU TAKE CARE OF HIS DAUGHTER.

12:12.565 --> 12:14.301
YOU'RE LIKE
A SON TO HIM.

12:14.301 --> 12:15.602
NO, I'M NOT.

12:15.602 --> 12:19.472
ALTHOUGH, HE DID BUY ME
A HAT AND A HOT DOG.

12:19.472 --> 12:21.374
AND THEN HE STOLE MY NOSE,

12:21.374 --> 12:23.643
BUT I KNOW
IT WAS JUST IN HIS HAND.

12:23.643 --> 12:28.782
YOU'RE UP, TIGER. HUH?
SINK THIS PUTT, AND WE WIN.

12:30.918 --> 12:33.286
HEY, INSTEAD OF SIX YEARS
OF MEDICAL SCHOOL,

12:33.286 --> 12:35.522
YOU SHOULD HAVE SPENT MORE TIME
AT THE DRIVING RANGE.

12:35.522 --> 12:38.058
YOU KNOW, I'D TRADE MY BEST DAY
ON THE GOLF COURSE

12:38.058 --> 12:41.394
FOR THE CHANCE TO HELP SOMEONE
LEAD A PAIN-FREE LIFE?

12:41.394 --> 12:44.197
YEAH. REALLY? Â¿SABES QUÃ©?
SELL IT SOMEWHERE ELSE, SISTER.

12:44.197 --> 12:46.566
BRING US THAT TROPHY,
GEORGE.

12:46.566 --> 12:48.768
IT'S A LITTLE UPHILL,
LEFT TO RIGHT 2 INCHES,

12:48.768 --> 12:50.770
I COULD MAKE THIS
IN MY SLEEP.

12:50.770 --> 12:52.772
AND THAT'S WHY
YOU'RE HERE. HMM?

12:52.772 --> 12:55.308
EH, HOW LUCKY AM I
THAT THEY MADE THIS

12:55.308 --> 12:58.445
A FATHER/SON TOURNAMENT
SO I COULD BRING IN MY RINGER?

13:00.413 --> 13:02.916
"RINGER"? THAT--THAT'S WHY
YOU ASKED ME TO PLAY?

13:02.916 --> 13:06.019
OF COURSE. I'M TIRED
OF LOSING TO THIS JERK,

13:06.019 --> 13:08.922
AND YOU'RE THE BEST GOLFER
I KNOW. (scoffs)

13:13.426 --> 13:16.763
THAT'S ALL I EVER WANTED
TO BE WHEN I WAS GROWING UP...

13:16.763 --> 13:19.366
SOMEONE'S LITTLE RINGER.

13:19.366 --> 13:21.601
YOU OKAY?

13:21.601 --> 13:26.206
YEAH, I JUST GOT SOME SAND
IN MY EYE FROM THE TRAP.

13:26.206 --> 13:29.142
(voice breaks) THAT,
AND NO ONE WANTS TO BE MY DAD.

13:29.142 --> 13:32.345
OKAY. WELL, IT BREAKS
RIGHT TO LEFT, SO...

13:43.623 --> 13:47.427
YOU PLAYED REALLY GREAT,
AND I'M SO PROUD OF YOU SON.
THANKS, DAD.

13:47.427 --> 13:49.396
UH-HUH, VERY TOUCHING.
COME ON, GEORGE.

13:49.396 --> 13:51.932
SINK THIS PUTT
AND LET THE GLOATING BEGIN.

13:51.932 --> 13:53.566
DON'T SWEAT IT, VIC.

13:53.566 --> 13:57.004
I'D HAVE TO MISS THREE SHOTS
IN A ROW TO BLOW THIS.

13:58.438 --> 14:00.773
OH, THAT'S ONE.

14:00.773 --> 14:03.443
GEORGE, HEY, FOCUS. HEY,
YOU HAVE TO MAKE THIS TO WIN.

14:03.443 --> 14:04.744
DON'T SWEAT IT, VIC.

14:04.744 --> 14:08.481
I BET I COULD MAKE THIS
WITH MY EYES CLOSED.

14:08.481 --> 14:11.784
I GUESS I CAN'T.

14:11.784 --> 14:14.054
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

14:14.054 --> 14:16.256
TELL HIM YOU LOVE HIM.

14:17.824 --> 14:19.792
GEORGE, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE,

14:19.792 --> 14:21.594
BUT THIS IS FOR THE TIE.

14:21.594 --> 14:23.630
COME ON, PLEASE, FOR ME.
MAKE THE PUTT.

14:23.630 --> 14:26.599
OH, FOR YOU?
OKAY, THAT'S DIFFERENT.

14:26.599 --> 14:28.501
I DEDICATE THIS PUTT

14:28.501 --> 14:32.772
TO VIC PALMERO.

14:32.772 --> 14:34.374
FORE!

14:34.374 --> 14:36.376
OH, I THOUGHT
I LOST MY BALL,

14:36.376 --> 14:38.545
BUT IT'S STUCK
IN YOUR WINDSHIELD, VIC.

14:41.748 --> 14:44.617
LOOK, GEORGE, OBVIOUSLY,
YOU'RE GOING THROUGH SOMETHING

14:44.617 --> 14:45.986
WITH YOUR FATHER-IN-LAW,

14:45.986 --> 14:48.221
AND THAT WASN'T
A REAL VICTORY FOR US.

14:49.789 --> 14:53.526
BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M GONNA
SAY IN THE CLUBHOUSE.

14:53.526 --> 14:54.794
WE SMOKED YOU, FOOL!

14:54.794 --> 14:56.964
SAY THAT AGAIN.

15:00.467 --> 15:02.035
WHATEVER.

15:09.476 --> 15:11.911
WHAT THE HELL
IS WRONG WITH YOU?

15:11.911 --> 15:14.047
WHAT DO YOU CARE?

15:17.550 --> 15:19.886
I STILL DON'T GET IT.

15:19.886 --> 15:21.688
HE STARTED THINKING OF YOU
AS A FATHER,

15:21.688 --> 15:24.992
BECAUSE HE THOUGHT YOU WERE
THINKING OF HIM AS A SON.

15:24.992 --> 15:28.661
AY,DIOS MÃ­O!
I HAD NO IDEA.
YEAH, WELL IT MAKES SENSE.

15:28.661 --> 15:30.863
I MEAN, WHO WOULDN'T
WANT YOU AS A FATHER?

15:30.863 --> 15:33.866
YOU'RE KIND,
WISE, GENEROUS--
YOU'RE NOT GETTING A TIP.

15:33.866 --> 15:37.537
DAMN IT! WHAT DID I CLEAN
YOUR CLUBS FOR THEN?

15:48.715 --> 15:50.450
HOW WAS THE TOURNAMENT?

15:50.450 --> 15:52.519
"GEORGE, HE WANTS
TO PLAY WITH YOU

15:52.519 --> 15:54.821
BECAUSE HE THINKS OF YOU
AS A SON."

15:54.821 --> 15:58.725
WRONG! HE ONLY WANTED ME THERE
BECAUSE I'M A GOOD GOLFER.

15:58.725 --> 16:00.193
NO.

16:00.193 --> 16:02.662
I'M SORRY, GEORGE.

16:02.662 --> 16:04.931
WHY DO I LISTEN TO YOU?

16:04.931 --> 16:06.866
BECAUSE I'M ALWAYS RIGHT,

16:06.866 --> 16:09.436
BUT I KNEW
I'D BE WRONG EVENTUALLY.

16:09.436 --> 16:13.640
OOH, I WAS RIGHT ABOUT THAT.
THE NEW STREAK BEGINS.

16:13.640 --> 16:14.707
THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT.

16:14.707 --> 16:16.709
YOU KNOW I HATE TO GET
EMOTIONALLY ATTACHED,

16:16.709 --> 16:19.412
AND YOU'RE ALWAYS PUSHING IT
ON ME--THE DOG, THE KIDS,

16:19.412 --> 16:23.350
THOSE TWINS FROM GUATEMALA
WHO WERE CONNECTED AT THE HIP.

16:23.350 --> 16:25.885
I HEARD THEY FINALLY
HAD THE OPERATION.

16:25.885 --> 16:27.387
REALLY? ARE THEY OKAY?

16:27.387 --> 16:29.889
NO. YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DON'T CARE.

16:29.889 --> 16:32.559
LUISA GOT
THE LONGER LEG.

16:32.559 --> 16:34.927
OH, GOOD.
SHE'S THE NICE ONE.

16:34.927 --> 16:38.398
SHE'S THE ONE
THAT WROTE BACK.

16:38.398 --> 16:40.033
CAN WE TALK?

16:40.033 --> 16:43.002
I'LL LEAVE
YOU TWO ALONE.

16:44.837 --> 16:48.575
UH... I DIDN'T KNOW
HOW TO MAKE IT UP TO YOU,

16:48.575 --> 16:51.444
SO I THOUGHT I'D COVER
ALL MY BASES.

16:51.444 --> 16:55.182
UH... I GOT YOU CIGARS....

16:55.182 --> 16:57.950
A BOX SET
OF DIRTY HARRY MOVIES...

16:57.950 --> 16:59.719
A YO-YO...

16:59.719 --> 17:02.922
COMIC BOOKS...

17:02.922 --> 17:05.592
AND SOME ICE CREAM.

17:05.592 --> 17:11.264
VIC, I'M NOT SOME 6-YEAR-OLD KID
YOU CAN BRIBE.

17:11.264 --> 17:15.168
I'LL TAKE THE CIGARS
AND THIS.

17:15.168 --> 17:18.571
LOOK, ERNIE TOLD ME
WHY YOU ARE UPSET.

17:18.571 --> 17:22.809
(sighs) I WAS SO FOCUSED
ON WINNING, I...

17:22.809 --> 17:24.644
I DIDN'T REALIZE THE EFFECT

17:24.644 --> 17:27.414
THE FATHER/SON EVENT
MIGHT HAVE ON YOU.

17:27.414 --> 17:29.916
LOOK, MAN, YOU KEPT SAYING
YOU WERE PROUD OF ME.

17:29.916 --> 17:31.784
YOU EVEN CALLED ME "SON."

17:31.784 --> 17:35.688
I KNOW. I KNOW,
AND I AM SORRY I MISLED YOU.

17:35.688 --> 17:37.690
WELL...

17:37.690 --> 17:40.693
I GUESS I LET MYSELF
GET CAUGHT UP IN THAT STUFF

17:40.693 --> 17:44.063
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I WOULD HAVE
WANTED IF I HAD A REAL DAD.

17:44.063 --> 17:45.832
CHIN UP.

17:47.800 --> 17:50.437
WELL,
IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE.

17:50.437 --> 17:52.539
IN MED SCHOOL,
I TOOK A PSYCHIATRY CLASS

17:52.539 --> 17:56.209
AND LEARNED THAT MEN
WHO GROW UP WITHOUT A FATHER

17:56.209 --> 18:00.413
END UP WITH MORE DADDY ISSUES
THAN A BUS FULL OF STRIPPERS.

18:02.549 --> 18:05.552
YOU KNOW, ANGIE'S BEEN TRYING
TO EXPLAIN MY LIFE TO ME

18:05.552 --> 18:08.921
FOR 20 YEARS WITH PSYCHOBABBLE,
BUT IN ONE SENTENCE--BOOM!

18:08.921 --> 18:11.691
I CAN SEE THE BUS IN MY MIND.

18:14.494 --> 18:19.366
WELL, I AM GLAD WE'VE BECOME
CLOSER OVER THE YEARS, GEORGE,

18:19.366 --> 18:23.703
AND I CAN HONESTLY SAY
THAT IF YOU WERE MY SON...

18:23.703 --> 18:26.773
I WOULD BE PROUD OF YOU.

18:26.773 --> 18:28.541
JUST 'CAUSE YOU SAID THAT,

18:28.541 --> 18:31.544
I'M GONNA TAKE THE YO-YO
AND THE DIRTY HARRY MOVIES.

18:31.544 --> 18:35.415
I DIDN'T WANT TO GIVE IN
TOO EASY AT FIRST.

18:35.415 --> 18:38.751
I DON'T SEE A TROPHY.

18:40.720 --> 18:43.556
WHICH ONE
OF YOU LOSERS CHOKED?

18:43.556 --> 18:46.559
IT DOESN'T MATTER. GEORGE AND I
WENT THROUGH SOMETHING,

18:46.559 --> 18:48.495
AND NOW WE
ARE IN A BETTER PLACE.

18:48.495 --> 18:51.130
I KNEW
IT WAS YOU.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.866
JUST LIKE LITTLE LEAGUE.
(gags)

18:53.866 --> 18:56.536
SOMEDAY YOU'RE GONNA
BE MAKING THAT SOUND,

18:56.536 --> 18:59.239
AND YOUR MACHINE
IS GONNA BE GOING LIKE THAT...

18:59.239 --> 19:00.673
(imitates monitor beeping)

19:00.673 --> 19:02.942
AND THE NURSES
WON'T BE ABLE TO GET IN

19:02.942 --> 19:05.212
BECAUSE
I LOCKED THE DOOR.

19:08.047 --> 19:10.149
YOU KNOW, GEORGE,

19:10.149 --> 19:12.785
A FATHER
IS SOMEONE WHO'S TOUGH,

19:12.785 --> 19:14.621
UNCOMPROMISING,

19:14.621 --> 19:18.191
WITH A STRONG
MASCULINE PRESENCE.

19:18.191 --> 19:19.826
(can opens)

19:27.166 --> 19:28.668
OH, MY GOD.

19:28.668 --> 19:32.672
I HAD A FATHER.
I JUST DIDN'T HAVE A MOTHER.

19:35.107 --> 19:36.743
DAD, I FELT BAD

19:36.743 --> 19:39.946
ABOUT THE FORM LETTER I GAVE
YOU FOR FATHER'S DAY, SO...

19:39.946 --> 19:42.815
I GOT YOU ANOTHER GIFT.

19:45.752 --> 19:50.257
"MANNY ORTEGA. JACK HALE.
OMAR MARTINEZ."

19:50.257 --> 19:52.259
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THIS IS, DUDE,

19:52.259 --> 19:54.261
BUT IF IT'S THE SAME
AS YOUR MOM'S, MAX,

19:54.261 --> 19:55.562
I-I SWEAR TO GOD--

19:55.562 --> 19:57.764
THOSE ARE KIDS
IN MY CLASS.

19:57.764 --> 19:59.499
READ THE ENDING.

20:01.568 --> 20:04.537
"I'M REALLY LUCKY
BECAUSE I HAVE A...

20:04.537 --> 20:08.941
"BETTER DAD THAN ANY OF THESE
KIDS I GO TO SCHOOL WITH.

20:08.941 --> 20:10.443
LOVE, MAX."

20:10.443 --> 20:12.679
HAPPY FATHER'S DAY.

20:14.381 --> 20:16.182
HEY, MAX, HOLD ON.

20:16.182 --> 20:17.617
YEAH?

20:17.617 --> 20:20.920
AREN'T THERE A LOT MORE KIDS
IN YOUR CLASS?

20:20.920 --> 20:23.856
YEAH, BUT I COULDN'T PUT
ANYONE ON THE LIST

20:23.856 --> 20:25.592
WHOSE DAD HAS A COOL JOB.

20:25.592 --> 20:28.595
I MEAN, SOME OF THEM ARE PILOTS
AND FIREFIGHTERS.

20:28.595 --> 20:30.096
WHAT ABOUT LUKE'S DAD?

20:30.096 --> 20:33.099
HE GOT BUSTED FOR SELLING DRUGS
OUT OF THE HOUSE.

20:33.099 --> 20:37.370
HE USED LUKE AS A HUMAN SHIELD
AGAINST THE COPS.

20:37.370 --> 20:39.972
YEAH, BUT HE WORKED
AT THE ZOO.

20:39.972 --> 20:42.475
HOW COOL IS THAT?
