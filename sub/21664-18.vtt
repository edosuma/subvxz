isn't that funny?

you were a robot,

Frankie's not a robot.

Right?

00:15.348 --> 00:16.433

It beats me.

another opportunity

- Ouch! But, yes.

Dr. Peters?

What's he got to
do with Andrew?

the one who created him?

Wait. I thought
you knew.

01:12.906 --> 01:14.240
Frankie said
she told you.

01:14.324 --> 01:15.950

Andrew was an android,

01:16.034 --> 01:18.244
not that my mom's
best friend made him.

01:18.328 --> 01:21.664

01:28.004 --> 01:29.339
Frankie will freak.

01:29.422 --> 01:31.508
So, she has to be the one
to tell your mom.

01:31.591 --> 01:33.510
- I could try and talk
some sense into her.

01:33.593 --> 01:34.260

01:34.344 --> 01:36.221
Why is it so steamy
in there?

01:36.304 --> 01:38.014
Did you turn
the hot water on?

01:38.097 --> 01:40.850

01:51.444 --> 01:53.363

Frankie to the rendezvous today.

I like Drew better.

02:03.414 --> 02:04.749

Bring her out.

02:06.251 --> 02:07.544
- Frankie, I need to--

02:07.627 --> 02:09.711
What is all this?

02:09.795 --> 02:11.214
- Byron and John thought
I needed bodyguards

02:11.297 --> 02:12.882
before the state finals.

02:12.966 --> 02:14.092
- Okay.

02:14.175 --> 02:16.302
Listen, I need to talk
to you about Andrew.

02:16.386 --> 02:18.263
- Dayton Reyes,
we have been over this.

02:18.346 --> 02:20.390
I cannot tell mom without
putting Andrew in danger.

02:20.473 --> 02:21.599
- But by not telling her,

02:21.683 --> 02:23.560
you're putting
yourself in danger.

02:23.643 --> 02:25.019
Jenny agrees with me,
you know?

02:25.103 --> 02:26.896
She doesn't trust
Dr. Peters, either.

02:26.980 --> 02:28.356
- You told Jenny
about him?

02:28.439 --> 02:29.774
- I thought
she already knew.

02:29.858 --> 02:32.402
Look, the point is we both
see how serious this is.

02:32.485 --> 02:33.903
It's bigger than
just Andrew.

02:33.987 --> 02:35.864

02:35.947 --> 02:38.658
We still gonna
meet later?

02:40.201 --> 02:41.369

it's a trap?

02:48.877 --> 02:49.669

all about?

02:49.752 --> 02:51.087
- Nothing.
She's always run weird.

02:51.170 --> 02:53.423
- No, I meant the heated
exchange with Frankie.

02:53.506 --> 02:55.633
I hope this doesn't affect
her Brain Squad performance.

02:55.717 --> 02:56.885
- Or their friendship.

02:56.968 --> 02:58.344
- [snaps fingers]
Oh, yeah. That, too.

02:58.428 --> 02:59.429
So, she's always run
like that?

02:59.512 --> 03:01.931
You haven't tried to show
her how to, you know?

03:02.015 --> 03:03.182
- Pump her arms?
- Yeah.

03:03.266 --> 03:06.185
- I tried.
She's a lost cause.

03:09.814 --> 03:10.773
- A bodyguard?

03:10.857 --> 03:13.151
I should have one, too.

03:13.234 --> 03:15.528
I am the Brain
Squad captain.

03:15.612 --> 03:17.322
The world's supposed
to see her for who,

03:17.405 --> 03:18.698
I mean, what, she is.

03:18.781 --> 03:20.909
- You need to drop
this Frankie obsession,

03:20.992 --> 03:22.452
and focus on state's.

03:22.535 --> 03:25.204

of that mental energy

03:25.288 --> 03:26.873

rally speech.
