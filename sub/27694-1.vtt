WEBVTT

02:11.131 --> 02:12.491
<i>Yeah, of course I remember.</i>

02:14.384 --> 02:15.591
<i>Not too long ago?</i>

02:19.514 --> 02:21.597
Ten years is nothing.
I remember everything.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.884
Well, we can't know.

02:26.938 --> 02:30.431
I mean, what you don't remember,
you don't know you don't remember.

02:31.777 --> 02:34.144
That's some education
in semantics you're giving me.

02:35.947 --> 02:38.564
Hey, let's skip the deposition

02:38.659 --> 02:40.571
and I can just take notes
on your lecture.

02:43.789 --> 02:44.789
I brought my case file.

02:45.082 --> 02:47.042
Thanks for coming in, Wayne.
It's good to see you.

02:47.084 --> 02:48.370
- Alan.
- How's the job?

02:50.796 --> 02:51.796
Still there.

02:55.050 --> 02:56.507
No major cases, but...

02:57.886 --> 02:59.673
Get more time with the wife and kids.

03:00.806 --> 03:01.967
That's good, I guess.

03:02.265 --> 03:05.508
I take time off, inside three days,
my wife tells me, "Get back to work."

03:07.938 --> 03:09.054
Well, Detective Hays,

03:09.231 --> 03:12.520
we need you to go back over
the Purcell case. Cases.

03:13.193 --> 03:14.980
Looking to overturn
the conviction, right?

03:19.282 --> 03:20.318
You good with that?

03:20.784 --> 03:22.241
I wouldn't be here otherwise.

03:22.869 --> 03:25.612
Why contest it now,
10 years after the fact?

03:28.125 --> 03:30.162
It's the family doing it,
I know. But why?

03:32.713 --> 03:34.420
You're having
memory problems, right?

03:35.549 --> 03:36.549
What?

03:37.092 --> 03:38.572
<i>You're having memory problems.</i>

03:39.094 --> 03:40.335
<i>Don't whine about it.</i>

03:41.805 --> 03:43.922
<i>Today's May 20th, 2015.</i>

03:45.142 --> 03:47.225
<i>Henry's coming with
the people from the TV.</i>

03:49.104 --> 03:52.188
<i>You don't like the questions,
or you don't wanna do it,</i>

03:53.024 --> 03:54.686
<i>Henry'll tell them to go screw.</i>

03:56.361 --> 03:57.921
<i>But remember why
you're talking to them.</i>

03:58.905 --> 04:00.362
<i>Figure out how much they know.</i>

04:01.158 --> 04:03.241
<i>You don't need no surprises
this late in the game.</i>

04:04.953 --> 04:07.366
<i>I'm recording this on the 19th.</i>

04:08.373 --> 04:11.662
<i>Today's the 20th.
Look at your pictures.</i>

04:12.085 --> 04:13.826
<i>Take notes. Remember.</i>

04:15.172 --> 04:16.754
<i>Remember the nightstand if you...</i>

04:17.882 --> 04:18.882
<i>If you need it.</i>

04:30.479 --> 04:31.640
- Hey, Dad.
- Hi.

04:33.064 --> 04:34.475
They're all set when you're ready.

04:37.778 --> 04:38.778
Mmm-hmm.

04:47.245 --> 04:48.861
I think it's a strong case.

04:50.749 --> 04:52.240
You're paid to think that, right?

04:56.213 --> 04:59.172
My wife's publishing a book about it.
Maybe she could help you.

05:00.175 --> 05:01.666
Let's get through this first.

05:02.719 --> 05:05.257
Could you tell us
about November 7th, 1980?

05:05.555 --> 05:06.966
Your timeline of events.

05:08.892 --> 05:09.892
Sure.

05:21.154 --> 05:23.487
November 7th, 1980.

05:25.909 --> 05:27.116
<i>Friday.</i>

05:28.411 --> 05:30.698
<i>I remember it was the day
Steve McQueen died.</i>

05:42.801 --> 05:45.293
Hey, Dad.
Can we ride out to the playground?

05:46.137 --> 05:47.137
What for?

05:47.639 --> 05:49.596
Ronnie's got a new dog
he's bringing out there.

05:52.644 --> 05:54.852
- Home by 5:30.
- Yes, sir.

06:01.611 --> 06:04.194
Hey, Dad. When's Mom coming home?

06:05.866 --> 06:06.866
I don't know.

06:07.951 --> 06:10.284
- Hey, watch out for your sister.
- Yes, sir.

06:11.621 --> 06:13.203
Home by 5:30. I mean it!

06:13.665 --> 06:15.810
Y'all be back before the sun
goes down, you understand?

06:15.834 --> 06:16.995
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

07:00.503 --> 07:02.995
Kids left their house
approximately 4:00 p.m.

07:04.299 --> 07:05.915
This from multiple statements.

07:15.644 --> 07:16.805
Come on, let's go!

07:24.319 --> 07:25.355
Let's go.

07:26.613 --> 07:28.853
- Dude, watch the leather, man.
- Dude, all right.

09:02.125 --> 09:03.805
<i>And what were you doing
that evening?</i>

09:05.879 --> 09:09.088
I was with my partner at the time.
Roland West.

09:11.384 --> 09:12.795
We were doing our regular shift.

09:13.803 --> 09:16.967
Following up on
a series of thefts, I believe.

09:19.517 --> 09:20.633
<i>Working cases.</i>

09:23.354 --> 09:24.720
You'll get him next time.

09:26.483 --> 09:29.191
Fate spared its shitty rat life,
and it has no clue.

09:30.695 --> 09:32.778
Another way of saying
you're slow on the draw.

09:41.790 --> 09:43.406
Steve McQueen died today.

09:58.848 --> 10:00.180
We should do something.

10:02.143 --> 10:03.350
We could go to Miss Minnie's.

10:04.479 --> 10:06.471
Give me a break.
I can't pay for it, man.

10:07.023 --> 10:09.140
It's more honest
than most relationships.

10:10.485 --> 10:12.977
You never bought no Saigon trim
while you was over there?

10:15.073 --> 10:16.564
Guess I'm a romantic.

10:17.784 --> 10:19.070
I'm a feminist.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.737
They want to sell me a piece
of ass, they got the right.

10:23.373 --> 10:24.373
Shit.

10:24.666 --> 10:26.749
You're gonna pay for it
one way or another.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.958
You see yourself
getting married, Purple?

10:36.678 --> 10:37.678
No, sir.

10:38.805 --> 10:40.091
I'm not a big enough asshole

10:40.181 --> 10:41.922
to put a woman
and children through that.

10:50.275 --> 10:51.275
Hey.

10:54.237 --> 10:55.237
Don't.

10:56.573 --> 10:58.405
Shh.

11:06.249 --> 11:07.249
Dick!

11:08.793 --> 11:10.785
Foxes are predatory vermin, son.

11:13.006 --> 11:16.295
Farmers, I was little, they gave
you a dollar, you kill a fox.

11:16.926 --> 11:18.526
I'll give you a dollar
for letting it go.

11:24.726 --> 11:25.967
Let's go ride around.

11:27.478 --> 11:28.935
Listen to some music.

11:30.148 --> 11:31.184
All right.

11:32.150 --> 11:34.984
Maybe we can find somebody
to beat the shit out of.

11:35.445 --> 11:36.561
Boy, that'd be nice.

12:27.705 --> 12:31.824
I don't think so. Let me ask him.
Hey, son? Ronnie?

12:33.086 --> 12:34.688
You seen the Purcell kids?
Will and his sister?

12:34.712 --> 12:36.078
- Were they here?
- No.

12:36.631 --> 12:38.213
Ronnie says they haven't been by.

12:38.424 --> 12:40.611
You heard from them at all?
Were they supposed to come by?

12:40.635 --> 12:43.799
No. I told him he could come by
to see the new puppy sometime.

12:44.305 --> 12:45.887
But he didn't say today.

12:46.474 --> 12:48.340
No, Tom, I'm sorry.
He hasn't heard from them.

12:49.227 --> 12:51.147
Yeah, he's been here
all afternoon, since school.

12:52.897 --> 12:55.139
All right.
I'll let you know if I hear anything.

13:37.358 --> 13:39.020
This fucking piece of shit.

14:15.605 --> 14:17.767
I don't wanna eat no boar meat, man.

14:19.567 --> 14:21.058
Tracked it for two days.

14:23.279 --> 14:25.316
Had to make my own muzzleloader
for the season.

14:26.366 --> 14:28.608
Why'd you kill a boar, but not a fox?

14:30.078 --> 14:32.286
Well, you eat the boar.

14:35.541 --> 14:38.955
I only had the one shot at him.
If I missed, that was my ass.

14:40.838 --> 14:43.706
Guess I like
a more level playing field.

14:45.885 --> 14:47.217
Except with rats.

14:48.638 --> 14:50.798
You know how many times
rats almost ended civilization?

14:51.933 --> 14:52.969
How many?

14:53.935 --> 14:55.471
I don't know. At least two.

14:57.605 --> 14:58.766
I hate rats.

14:59.941 --> 15:02.479
What about deer? You hunt deer?

15:02.819 --> 15:04.026
Only with a bow.

15:05.196 --> 15:07.108
Never in a stand and never with bait.

15:09.117 --> 15:11.404
<i>D-12, over. D-12, do you copy?</i>

15:16.040 --> 15:17.451
D-12 here. Over.

15:18.042 --> 15:21.035
<i>PD in West Finger called for assist.
Missing persons.</i>

15:21.421 --> 15:23.708
<i>That's 5009 Shoepick Lane.</i>

15:26.259 --> 15:28.922
Copy. We got it. Be there in 10.

15:32.098 --> 15:33.098
Fifteen.

15:34.809 --> 15:35.925
Shoepick Lane?

15:36.769 --> 15:40.012
Go towards Devil's Den.
You know how to get to West Finger.

15:42.817 --> 15:44.649
We almost had a clean night, man.

15:46.195 --> 15:47.606
Turn on the light if you want.

16:16.642 --> 16:17.758
It's Tom Purcell.

16:18.019 --> 16:20.727
Two kids, William and Julie,
12 and 10.

16:20.813 --> 16:22.850
Supposed to be home by 5:30,
never arrived.

16:22.940 --> 16:24.860
They not been home
before the sun goes down.

16:25.276 --> 16:26.562
That part I know.

16:30.615 --> 16:32.175
<i>Is this setup okay for you?</i>

16:33.576 --> 16:36.410
Uh, yes. This is fine.

16:46.756 --> 16:48.713
So, you caught the case back in '80.

16:49.759 --> 16:51.170
Uh, yes.

16:54.680 --> 16:56.012
Big full moon that night...

16:57.558 --> 16:58.558
And, uh...

17:03.189 --> 17:04.305
I remember the moon.

17:04.982 --> 17:07.395
And Steve McQueen had died.

17:09.403 --> 17:12.646
Will and Julie.
I can't find them anywhere.

17:13.241 --> 17:15.403
Listen, we need a bunch of people
out here right now.

17:15.492 --> 17:17.762
Okay, you need to be on every street,
down in the woods...

17:17.787 --> 17:19.574
All right, Mr. Purcell,
slow down, please.

17:20.414 --> 17:21.849
Take us through what happened,
you could,

17:21.874 --> 17:23.580
so we can know the right thing
to do next.

17:29.382 --> 17:33.251
Went riding their bikes, around 4:00.
Supposed to be home by 5:30.

17:34.595 --> 17:36.031
They were supposed
to go by a friend's house.

17:36.055 --> 17:37.546
Kid says he never saw them.

17:38.516 --> 17:40.382
<i>Never occurred to you
he might be lying?</i>

17:41.102 --> 17:42.263
Of course it did.

17:43.271 --> 17:46.309
General rule is, everybody's lying.
Period.

17:47.900 --> 17:49.641
First impression, though, no.

17:50.820 --> 17:53.062
I did not believe he was fabricating.
Not about this.

17:54.115 --> 17:55.401
"About this"?

17:55.658 --> 17:59.902
Yeah. I mean, I checked around

17:59.996 --> 18:02.409
if he was honest about
his overtime or his height.

18:07.253 --> 18:08.539
What is this, really?

18:09.672 --> 18:10.958
Y'all know something I don't?

18:11.299 --> 18:13.791
Well, we don't know what you know.

18:15.261 --> 18:17.093
So we can't really answer that.

18:19.849 --> 18:21.681
I was deposed when the man's family

18:21.767 --> 18:24.384
tried getting the conviction
overturned in '90.

18:26.105 --> 18:28.688
Then worked the case again
when it was reopened.

18:29.900 --> 18:31.641
That's when my wife
published the book.

18:33.321 --> 18:35.233
Wish you could've
talked to her.

18:38.200 --> 18:42.945
I used to think back then
it was before 'Nam and after 'Nam.

18:44.332 --> 18:49.043
But more it's
before the Purcell case and after.

18:51.297 --> 18:52.959
And it keeps coming back.

18:54.133 --> 18:55.499
And here we are.

18:56.302 --> 18:58.294
What is it, 2015?

19:00.222 --> 19:01.633
Come back again.

19:03.351 --> 19:05.934
And your wife's book,
which is now, well,

19:06.020 --> 19:08.478
it's considered a classic
of literary nonfiction.

19:10.399 --> 19:13.142
Yeah. Yeah.

19:16.405 --> 19:17.646
She did a good job.

19:22.078 --> 19:23.194
She was a good...

19:27.667 --> 19:28.828
She was a good writer.

19:31.545 --> 19:32.706
Good teacher...

19:33.631 --> 19:35.338
Good investigator, really.

19:36.884 --> 19:38.295
She was good at lots of things.

19:39.887 --> 19:42.425
- I'm sorry for your loss.
- Yeah.

19:43.641 --> 19:44.802
A few years back...

19:49.438 --> 19:51.725
We made plans. I retired and...

19:56.362 --> 19:57.853
It just got me thinking.

20:01.826 --> 20:04.489
Those kids. My kids. My wife.

20:19.176 --> 20:20.383
I'm sorry.

20:21.512 --> 20:23.174
Guess I'm just missing her today.

20:27.101 --> 20:31.186
Your wife, Mr. Purcell.
She expected back tonight?

20:34.483 --> 20:35.483
I think.

20:38.404 --> 20:39.611
I don't know.

20:39.947 --> 20:41.688
Any chance the kids could be with her?

20:41.782 --> 20:44.024
No. No, no chance.

20:44.869 --> 20:46.109
Have you talked to her?

20:46.787 --> 20:48.147
Well, not since this morning.

20:49.039 --> 20:50.575
She waitresses down at The Sawhorse.

20:51.584 --> 20:54.577
She's out with her friends now,
and I can't reach her.

20:56.130 --> 20:57.291
Get the APB out right away.

20:57.798 --> 20:59.558
I need as many troopers
as Highway can spare.

20:59.633 --> 21:00.749
K-9 trackers.

21:01.177 --> 21:03.217
If State's isn't available,
check with the sheriffs.

21:03.387 --> 21:04.987
We're gonna search the fields,
the woods,

21:05.264 --> 21:06.755
put patrols on every street.

21:06.849 --> 21:08.841
High beams out.
I wanna light all this up.

21:08.934 --> 21:10.294
Ain't you gonna call the FBI?

21:11.228 --> 21:12.890
I mean, that's what they do on TV.

21:13.105 --> 21:16.314
Takes 72 hours, sir.
We don't know yet if...

21:18.652 --> 21:19.893
We have to wait on that.

21:20.321 --> 21:22.654
You two. Start canvassing neighbors.

21:22.740 --> 21:24.777
Ask if they saw the kids,
anything unusual.

21:25.493 --> 21:27.655
Any other relatives
the kids might be with?

21:27.745 --> 21:31.364
No. No, my parents
are in Shreveport, and Lucy's passed.

21:32.917 --> 21:35.580
You know what? Talk to Ronnie Boyle.
Will's friend.

21:36.253 --> 21:38.253
You know, I could take y'all
out to the playground.

21:38.547 --> 21:39.708
Okay, sure.

21:41.300 --> 21:43.737
Mind if we look around the house while
we wait on the other officers?

21:43.761 --> 21:45.718
They're not in the fucking house.

21:45.805 --> 21:48.013
Yes, sir, but sometimes,

21:48.474 --> 21:50.340
might be some kind of clue
where they went,

21:50.726 --> 21:52.058
if they had other plans.

21:52.686 --> 21:54.623
- What? Why would they...
- Just saying, sir.

21:54.647 --> 21:56.138
It's been known to do some good.

21:56.357 --> 21:57.626
We have to consider all possibilities.

21:57.650 --> 21:58.650
Yeah.

21:59.985 --> 22:03.399
- Whatever. You know, do what you want.
- Mr. Purcell...

22:03.572 --> 22:06.292
Take the house apart, you want.
Flip on the TV. Grab yourself a beer.

22:06.325 --> 22:07.525
I'm going out to find my kids.

22:08.953 --> 22:10.660
I know you want to do that, sir,

22:11.580 --> 22:14.493
but I promise,
we're getting that handled.

22:14.583 --> 22:16.415
We need you nearby,
answering questions

22:16.502 --> 22:17.913
or if somebody calls.

22:19.421 --> 22:20.421
Oh.

22:21.215 --> 22:22.581
You promise?

22:24.426 --> 22:25.426
Huh?

22:27.680 --> 22:28.887
Yes, sir.

22:31.433 --> 22:32.924
Can you take us through the house?

22:34.979 --> 22:35.979
Please?

23:09.471 --> 23:10.803
That's Will's room.

23:12.474 --> 23:13.474
That's Julie's.

23:19.064 --> 23:20.224
That one you and your wife's?

23:22.860 --> 23:24.101
My wife's.

23:27.072 --> 23:29.780
Well, go on. Knock yourself out.

24:13.953 --> 24:16.286
Think his wife left him,
took the kids?

24:18.165 --> 24:20.327
I mean, they ain't together.

24:21.293 --> 24:22.500
Think you're right.

24:26.006 --> 24:27.372
I hope you're right.

24:30.469 --> 24:32.882
Expect she'll call by the morning
if that's the case.

24:35.641 --> 24:38.328
<i>In fact, our first thought was
the wife had taken off with the kids</i>

24:38.352 --> 24:39.593
and hadn't told the guy.

24:40.896 --> 24:42.512
The marriage wasn't in a good place.

24:43.899 --> 24:45.356
When'd you drop that theory?

24:47.319 --> 24:48.855
About two minutes later.

24:49.279 --> 24:51.257
- What the fuck is going on, Tom?
- Let me talk to you.

24:51.281 --> 24:52.647
Lucy! Come here, God damn it.

24:53.283 --> 24:54.694
What happened?

24:56.662 --> 24:58.949
What did you do? What did you do?

24:59.039 --> 25:01.531
Me? Me? You're their fucking mother.
Where were you?

25:01.625 --> 25:02.625
Where were you?

25:02.710 --> 25:06.169
I am entitled to a life!
All you had to do was watch them!

25:06.422 --> 25:08.505
I let them ride bikes
like we done a million times.

25:08.590 --> 25:11.070
All right? Maybe if you were home
and not out looking for dick!

25:11.135 --> 25:12.251
Mrs. Purcell.

25:13.512 --> 25:16.175
I'm Wayne Hays. This is Roland West.

25:17.599 --> 25:18.965
State Police detectives.

25:19.727 --> 25:22.219
We put an APB on your kids.
We got men coming to search now.

25:22.855 --> 25:24.695
Can you think of anywhere
they might have gone?

25:25.399 --> 25:27.186
Friends or relations?

25:27.693 --> 25:30.276
No. We don't have any...

25:31.530 --> 25:33.522
Relatives close or nearby.

25:33.615 --> 25:37.780
I don't understand. What happened?

25:38.746 --> 25:41.659
You dumbass! You piece of shit!

25:41.832 --> 25:43.869
- You slut! You slut!
- You stupid piece of shit!

25:43.959 --> 25:44.959
Hey!

25:46.086 --> 25:47.918
You been drinking tonight,
Mrs. Purcell?

25:48.380 --> 25:49.380
What?

25:50.466 --> 25:52.628
So? It's not against the law.

25:52.718 --> 25:54.926
- I'm entitled to a life.
- Of course you are.

25:55.596 --> 25:57.836
But you two getting mad
isn't helping anything right now.

25:58.348 --> 26:00.305
You need to work together, with us.

26:00.893 --> 26:02.384
Okay? For the kids.

26:04.563 --> 26:06.600
God damn it, he's so stupid.

26:07.775 --> 26:10.108
Everything you touch turns to shit.

26:10.194 --> 26:12.464
You been running me down...
You been running me down for 10 years.

26:12.488 --> 26:13.488
Hey!

26:14.448 --> 26:16.405
Why don't we get some coffee going,
all right?

26:17.659 --> 26:19.241
Everybody just calm down.

26:24.666 --> 26:26.123
I'll make the coffee.

26:41.433 --> 26:44.346
Kids headed west down the street,
going to a playground near the school.

26:44.895 --> 26:47.478
I want three two-man teams
going through these fields

26:47.564 --> 26:48.975
<i>between the main roads.</i>

27:09.211 --> 27:10.211
<i>Everybody else,</i>

27:10.712 --> 27:13.204
get spotlights up and down
each one of these streets.

27:13.340 --> 27:15.332
Here, here and here.

27:16.260 --> 27:17.626
<i>Y'all start canvassing.</i>

27:29.940 --> 27:32.478
We're waiting on dogs,
but let's get going.

27:32.568 --> 27:33.775
Yes, sir.

28:42.554 --> 28:44.034
I ain't never seen these before.

28:44.806 --> 28:47.048
You sure? No judgement.

28:47.976 --> 28:51.140
- I mean, I read it myself.
- Yeah. So do I.

28:51.980 --> 28:54.768
But these are old,
and I never seen them.

28:58.111 --> 28:59.272
He had these?

29:00.155 --> 29:02.488
- It's not unusual.
- No.

29:05.410 --> 29:06.821
Y'all find anything else?

29:08.538 --> 29:09.574
No, sir.

29:11.166 --> 29:12.532
If we could ask their mother,

29:13.585 --> 29:15.985
maybe she could tell us
they have any clothes missing or not.

29:16.713 --> 29:17.899
Might point us if they run off.

29:17.923 --> 29:19.835
No, I don't think
she's in shape for that.

29:21.009 --> 29:23.342
And they didn't run off.
I'm telling you.

29:23.428 --> 29:25.761
Yes, sir. But it needs doing.

29:26.723 --> 29:27.884
Save us time.

29:57.546 --> 29:58.986
<i>I didn't see the children.</i>

29:59.715 --> 30:03.709
But I saw some older boys, teenagers,
in a purple Volkswagen Bug.

30:05.554 --> 30:07.090
I wasn't home until after 7:00.

30:08.640 --> 30:11.849
I saw the two kids
riding out toward the park.

30:12.978 --> 30:14.560
But I didn't see any teenagers.

30:15.689 --> 30:17.601
But I know they hang around
at Devil's Den.

30:18.984 --> 30:22.148
I hear things,
about what they do out there.

30:23.947 --> 30:25.404
Yeah, sometimes, like,

30:25.949 --> 30:28.157
out by the ranger tower
at the edge of the park,

30:28.869 --> 30:31.031
people hang out, listen to music.

30:32.247 --> 30:35.081
Um, that Volkswagen is
Freddy Burns', I think.

30:35.751 --> 30:38.960
I seen that "Trash Man" fella.
I don't know his name.

30:39.796 --> 30:42.630
Rides around town in a go-cart,
picking through garbage.

30:43.091 --> 30:44.377
Everybody knows him.

30:44.801 --> 30:47.635
Patty, what's that
"Trash Man" guy's name?

30:48.680 --> 30:51.047
His last name's Woodard, I think.

30:52.184 --> 30:56.178
I saw him riding around
when I was looking for the kids.

30:57.064 --> 31:01.058
He drives a go-cart
and tows this little trailer.

31:01.151 --> 31:04.565
He picks up trash and sells it
at the scrapyard, I guess.

31:04.654 --> 31:05.861
Been around for years.

31:06.948 --> 31:07.984
I never liked him.

31:08.784 --> 31:10.446
Going through other people's trash.

31:11.078 --> 31:12.569
Any idea where he lives?

31:14.956 --> 31:17.744
We're sorry for the personal nature
of these questions,

31:19.044 --> 31:20.564
but we need to know everything we can.

31:23.048 --> 31:24.789
How long you folks
been sleeping separate?

31:26.426 --> 31:28.668
- Few months.
- About six months.

31:28.762 --> 31:31.032
- Since beginning of summer.
- Hasn't been that long.

31:31.056 --> 31:34.094
Yeah, it has. Dan left last May,
then I took the couch.

31:34.601 --> 31:36.763
- Dan?
- He's my cousin.

31:37.312 --> 31:38.748
Stayed with us a few weeks
last spring.

31:38.772 --> 31:40.183
He's like an uncle to the kids.

31:40.982 --> 31:42.348
And what's his last name?

31:42.442 --> 31:45.526
O'Brien. Same as mine. Used to be.

31:46.530 --> 31:47.611
Where's he live?

31:47.989 --> 31:49.981
He's up in Springfield, Missouri.

31:51.284 --> 31:53.321
But he hasn't seen the family
in a long time.

31:53.829 --> 31:54.889
He stayed there on the couch?

31:54.913 --> 31:58.077
No, he stayed in Will's room.
Will was on the couch.

32:05.215 --> 32:07.047
Would you write down his contact info?

32:08.218 --> 32:09.379
Phone number and address.

32:09.594 --> 32:11.927
What for? Been gone since May.

32:12.514 --> 32:14.255
Just have to check out
anything we can.

32:14.975 --> 32:18.059
Sometimes, there's tension
between the parents,

32:19.104 --> 32:20.390
or fighting and whatnot.

32:21.398 --> 32:23.014
Kids'll make like to run away.

32:23.108 --> 32:24.895
They didn't run away, God damn it.

32:26.069 --> 32:28.402
Why don't you go find
that "Trash Man" bastard

32:28.488 --> 32:29.979
and ask him some questions?

32:30.323 --> 32:32.690
- Did you talk to Ronnie Boyle?
- We did.

32:33.368 --> 32:35.030
Hadn't seen Will since school.

32:35.662 --> 32:37.494
Parents said he'd been home
since 3:00.

32:37.747 --> 32:39.507
But they didn't run off.

32:51.761 --> 32:53.878
<i>Everybody went home
to wait for daylight.</i>

32:55.098 --> 32:56.964
<i>I didn't go to sleep that first night.</i>

32:57.642 --> 33:00.350
<i>I stayed out, trying to find a trail.</i>

33:03.982 --> 33:05.814
<i>I was a tracker, you see.</i>

33:39.893 --> 33:41.009
I should stop.

33:42.812 --> 33:43.928
Do I need to stop?

33:46.358 --> 33:48.520
No, uh, we're okay.

33:49.945 --> 33:51.311
Sorry about that.

33:52.280 --> 33:53.862
Please, continue, Mr. Hays.

33:53.990 --> 33:54.990
Uh...

33:56.576 --> 33:59.489
Had maybe 15 guys
out that first night.

34:00.539 --> 34:02.155
They went home after a few hours.

34:02.832 --> 34:06.075
Day would give us better odds.
Get the news to help.

34:07.671 --> 34:10.379
<i>Two children are missing
from a West Finger neighborhood.</i>

34:10.924 --> 34:12.880
<i>Will and Julie Purcell were last seen</i>

34:12.967 --> 34:15.630
<i>riding their bicycles west
on Turpin Road</i>

34:15.719 --> 34:19.929
<i>not far from Devil's Den State Park,
around 4:00 yesterday afternoon.</i>

34:20.308 --> 34:22.925
<i>Police are calling on volunteers
to aid in the search</i>

34:23.018 --> 34:25.978
<i>and are asking all residents
to keep an eye out</i>

34:26.063 --> 34:28.647
<i>and report anything unusual
they might have noticed,</i>

34:29.359 --> 34:31.817
<i>or believe might be relevant
to the case.</i>

34:31.902 --> 34:34.235
<i>The brother and sister are 12 and 10,</i>

34:34.322 --> 34:36.688
<i>and attend the West Finger
school system.</i>

34:52.340 --> 34:54.002
<i>"Tell me a story</i>

34:55.927 --> 34:59.511
<i>"In this century, and moment, of mania</i>

35:01.308 --> 35:02.924
<i>"Tell me a story</i>

35:05.186 --> 35:08.930
"Make it a story of great distances

35:11.109 --> 35:14.022
"The name of the story will be Time

35:14.904 --> 35:16.987
"But you must not pronounce its name

35:18.450 --> 35:21.784
"Tell me a story of deep delight"

35:24.289 --> 35:25.905
What do you think
Warren means by that?

35:27.250 --> 35:29.993
Why mustn't you say
the name of the story?

35:31.421 --> 35:32.457
Anybody?

35:34.424 --> 35:35.424
Riley?

35:37.886 --> 35:40.674
I teach English,
eighth through 12th grade.

35:41.514 --> 35:42.800
Will's a student of mine, too.

35:43.892 --> 35:47.761
You got a boy in your class right now,
a senior, named Freddy Burns?

35:51.358 --> 35:52.769
Yes. He's here today.

35:53.526 --> 35:54.646
We'd like to speak with him.

35:55.820 --> 35:56.820
Okay.

35:57.822 --> 35:59.313
What are you studying?

36:01.493 --> 36:02.493
The quote.

36:03.995 --> 36:06.703
Oh, uh, it's a poem we're discussing.

36:07.248 --> 36:08.248
Huh.

36:18.760 --> 36:20.592
- What?
- "What?"

36:24.641 --> 36:26.321
<i>We were just hanging out,
you know?</i>

36:27.227 --> 36:29.469
Go down to the ranger tower,
mess around.

36:29.896 --> 36:31.262
What time was that?

36:31.523 --> 36:32.604
Um...

36:32.691 --> 36:35.183
Maybe 4:30,
4:45 we got there, I think.

36:35.276 --> 36:39.646
And that was you,
Ryan Peters and this Lampanella boy?

36:40.532 --> 36:42.569
- Anybody drinking?
- No, sir.

36:47.580 --> 36:50.789
See on the news this morning,
about those missing kids?

36:52.293 --> 36:55.036
These two. You recognize them?

36:56.297 --> 36:57.504
Yeah, I seen them around.

36:59.426 --> 37:00.758
I think we saw them.

37:01.219 --> 37:02.505
You saw them?

37:03.138 --> 37:04.345
Riding their bikes.

37:05.306 --> 37:07.673
Yesterday. We passed them
when we were driving.

37:08.560 --> 37:09.721
What time was that?

37:10.603 --> 37:13.767
Maybe 4:15. Before we got to the park.

37:13.898 --> 37:15.938
You saw them riding their bikes
in the neighborhood?

37:16.735 --> 37:17.771
Yes, sir.

37:18.236 --> 37:20.774
Just the once?
You didn't see them again?

37:21.322 --> 37:23.234
- No, sir.
- And they weren't out at the tower?

37:24.534 --> 37:25.775
No. No, sir.

37:27.078 --> 37:28.660
What time y'all leave the park?

37:29.080 --> 37:30.080
Uh...

37:30.165 --> 37:33.784
It was about 9:00, I think.
A little after.

37:34.544 --> 37:35.625
Let me ask you.

37:38.006 --> 37:39.122
What's up with this?

37:41.926 --> 37:45.670
I mean, it's... It's just a band.

37:46.848 --> 37:48.089
Black Sabbath, huh?

37:49.476 --> 37:50.512
What's a Black Sabbath?

37:52.020 --> 37:53.261
It's a satanic mass.

37:54.939 --> 37:57.556
Is that true? It's satanic?

37:58.693 --> 37:59.934
I think it's just their name.

38:11.664 --> 38:13.747
You see either of
these children yesterday?

38:18.046 --> 38:19.046
What?

38:23.635 --> 38:24.716
Yeah.

38:26.012 --> 38:27.344
I mean, yes, sir. I...

38:28.348 --> 38:31.136
They were out playing in the park.

38:31.768 --> 38:33.009
You saw them in the park?

38:36.356 --> 38:38.476
Were they up at the tower
when y'all were hanging out?

38:39.317 --> 38:41.354
No. I...

38:42.570 --> 38:44.186
I mean, I don't think so.

38:44.280 --> 38:45.521
But you don't know.

38:47.534 --> 38:49.845
I don't know all the kids that
were playing out there, you know?

38:49.869 --> 38:51.326
There were other kids out there?

38:51.621 --> 38:53.829
Yeah. They weren't with us.

38:55.291 --> 38:57.328
There were a couple kids
playing with firecrackers

38:57.418 --> 39:01.708
and younger kids just running around,
but we didn't talk to them.

39:02.257 --> 39:03.998
You know any of their names?

39:06.219 --> 39:07.219
No.

39:08.429 --> 39:10.546
Anything you can tell me about Will?

39:11.933 --> 39:16.177
His friends? Family?
Any sense you might've had?

39:19.065 --> 39:20.181
He's a good student.

39:21.818 --> 39:24.982
Quiet, polite in homeroom.

39:25.905 --> 39:27.105
He's very advanced in English.

39:30.076 --> 39:32.489
As far as home, I don't really know.

39:33.162 --> 39:34.903
I don't know either of his parents.

39:36.332 --> 39:37.618
But he's a nice boy.

39:40.128 --> 39:41.664
He has a sensitivity.

39:42.630 --> 39:45.668
You always worry a bit
about the sensitive ones.

39:46.092 --> 39:47.092
Hmm.

39:47.635 --> 39:49.422
There's a few of the older boys here,

39:49.512 --> 39:51.504
you know, they make it hard
on the others.

39:52.515 --> 39:54.757
But I never saw Will
getting any trouble.

39:55.643 --> 39:56.643
I just...

39:58.354 --> 40:01.518
Well, I don't think
he got noticed much.

40:02.901 --> 40:04.141
For how long you been teaching?

40:04.736 --> 40:07.228
- About six years.
- All at West Finger?

40:07.488 --> 40:08.569
Yes, sir.

40:09.032 --> 40:10.944
Hey, you say "sir,"
I start looking for my boss.

40:11.284 --> 40:15.779
No, I'm sorry. Just, you know. Police.

40:21.753 --> 40:22.834
How is it here?

40:24.172 --> 40:25.208
You know.

40:26.633 --> 40:27.633
It's fine.

40:29.052 --> 40:31.009
It's good, really, for what it is.

40:32.263 --> 40:34.220
I hear something now and then.

40:36.017 --> 40:38.350
They're all poor around here.
That's the main thing.

40:39.562 --> 40:40.973
What you hear now and then?

40:41.981 --> 40:45.691
You know,
a word in the hallway or something.

40:47.946 --> 40:49.482
They're careful around me.

40:54.661 --> 40:56.368
What about these boys,

40:57.288 --> 41:00.497
Freddy Burns, Ryan Peters
and Jason Lampanella?

41:01.501 --> 41:04.665
I don't know.
They're kinda their own little group.

41:05.838 --> 41:10.708
They posture a lot,
but I'd say they're mostly outcasts.

41:12.470 --> 41:16.054
Tough attitudes, can't talk to girls,
that kind of thing.

41:20.937 --> 41:22.303
And Will's good in English?

41:22.647 --> 41:26.357
Reads at a 12th-grade level,
writes very well,

41:27.402 --> 41:28.893
pays attention in class.

41:30.321 --> 41:32.278
He's a bit shy about speaking up.

41:33.825 --> 41:34.825
And, uh...

41:36.703 --> 41:37.910
You from this area?

41:39.956 --> 41:41.072
Fayetteville.

41:41.958 --> 41:43.244
Still live there.

41:44.043 --> 41:45.284
So do I.

41:46.045 --> 41:47.161
Nice place.

41:47.839 --> 41:48.839
Yep.

41:53.886 --> 41:55.548
All right, um...

41:56.848 --> 41:58.214
Thanks very much, Miss Reardon.

41:59.017 --> 42:00.929
Well, now you have me
looking for my mother.

42:01.436 --> 42:02.722
Yeah, okay.

42:03.771 --> 42:06.229
- I'm Wayne.
- Amelia.

42:07.567 --> 42:08.567
Okay.

42:10.528 --> 42:12.110
Think you'll find those children?

42:13.072 --> 42:14.153
I've got hope.

42:18.161 --> 42:19.841
I'll let you know
if there's anything else.

42:19.996 --> 42:20.996
Please do.

42:22.331 --> 42:23.572
Anything at all.

42:27.503 --> 42:28.539
Do you have a number?

42:42.351 --> 42:43.933
- I'll be in touch.
- Good.

42:53.112 --> 42:54.319
Think they're lying?

42:55.406 --> 42:58.149
I mean, they're lying.

42:59.827 --> 43:03.320
Think it's just regular teenage lying,
or something else?

43:04.957 --> 43:06.038
I don't know.

43:07.960 --> 43:09.576
The one, Burns, lied about the beer.

43:10.963 --> 43:12.955
- There's lots of reasons to do that.
- Mmm-hmm.

43:15.176 --> 43:17.088
Put a couple guys
tailing Burns and Peters.

43:17.595 --> 43:20.178
Hit this address up
for the trash can guy, Woodard.

43:21.599 --> 43:23.431
Come back on the teenagers,
we need to.

43:26.604 --> 43:30.097
What about that teacher?
You gonna come back on her?

43:35.655 --> 43:36.816
Uh-huh.

43:39.700 --> 43:41.532
<i>After the school, we, uh</i>

43:43.704 --> 43:45.946
checked out that guy
people called "Trash Man."

43:47.917 --> 43:48.917
Brett Woodard.

43:54.090 --> 43:57.174
<i>Used to ride around in his go-cart
collecting garbage.</i>

43:59.387 --> 44:00.594
<i>He wasn't home.</i>

44:02.181 --> 44:04.514
<i>Checked around his place,
the door was open.</i>

44:07.520 --> 44:10.763
<i>Anyways,
you know what happened with him.</i>

45:33.940 --> 45:35.602
Think the backyard was neater.

45:43.824 --> 45:45.781
A lot of guys have trouble,
they come back.

45:46.994 --> 45:47.994
Mmm-hmm.

45:49.997 --> 45:51.704
I heard
one of my old rodeo buddies

45:51.791 --> 45:53.532
is on the street in Shreveport.

45:54.669 --> 45:57.161
And another buddy
went to prison in Oklahoma.

45:58.422 --> 46:00.129
Killed a dude in a bar fight.

46:02.134 --> 46:03.466
You know guys like that?

46:06.681 --> 46:07.681
Couple.

46:11.352 --> 46:13.093
Put an APB on this guy.

46:34.041 --> 46:35.248
I'm ready to go now.

46:37.712 --> 46:39.078
I don't want to be here.

46:40.214 --> 46:42.331
- I need to stop for today.
- Oh.

46:42.633 --> 46:43.633
Um...

46:43.718 --> 46:45.880
Well, we didn't really
get into the questions.

46:46.637 --> 46:48.924
I understand if it's difficult
to discuss Mr. Woodard...

46:49.015 --> 46:50.051
Not today.

46:52.143 --> 46:53.350
I'm sorry.

46:57.648 --> 47:00.561
- You all right, Pop?
- I think. I don't know.

47:00.735 --> 47:02.495
- Can you get them out of here?
- Yeah, sure.

47:41.275 --> 47:44.188
Wanna thank the volunteers
came out with us today.

47:45.112 --> 47:46.273
It's a tough thing.

47:50.284 --> 47:51.491
Check this spot.

47:52.828 --> 47:54.785
Get those fucking dogs away from me.

47:55.289 --> 47:56.289
Yeah.

48:18.270 --> 48:19.511
What's your partner doing?

48:21.232 --> 48:22.439
He's got his own thing.

48:23.692 --> 48:25.058
Well, how's that help us?

48:26.195 --> 48:29.188
Man was a LRRP in 'Nam.
You know what that is?

48:30.658 --> 48:32.069
Long range reconnaissance.

48:33.661 --> 48:35.493
Drop them in the jungle alone,

48:36.664 --> 48:39.873
come out two or three weeks later,
with scalps.

48:42.586 --> 48:43.622
He's like a pathfinder.

48:45.756 --> 48:47.543
Tracks wild boar for fun.

48:50.386 --> 48:52.969
He wanna look alone, I'm okay with it.

52:53.629 --> 52:54.629
Shit.

53:45.556 --> 53:46.556
Roland?

53:47.516 --> 53:48.597
<i>Copy.</i>

53:49.268 --> 53:50.600
I found the boy.

53:59.570 --> 54:00.777
<i>"What is love?</i>

54:02.740 --> 54:05.653
"One name for it is Knowledge."

54:16.754 --> 54:17.994
Dad?

54:20.132 --> 54:22.545
Crew cleared out. They're gone.

54:28.932 --> 54:29.932
Pop?

54:59.755 --> 55:01.115
There's another one of them dolls.

55:02.424 --> 55:03.424
Further back.

55:06.303 --> 55:07.919
Right where the trail got sketchy.

55:10.557 --> 55:12.890
- Bag them all.
- Okay.

55:15.813 --> 55:16.813
Leading me.

55:18.774 --> 55:20.356
Like a marker or something.

55:25.489 --> 55:26.900
Kid's head looked injured.

55:31.036 --> 55:33.073
Did a little tunnel work
over there, you know?

55:35.749 --> 55:37.285
Almost couldn't go inside.

55:39.002 --> 55:40.002
All right.

55:41.505 --> 55:42.837
There's no sign of the girl.

55:43.590 --> 55:45.390
We have to get back out there
looking for her.

55:45.759 --> 55:48.172
Okay, man. All right. We will.

55:53.058 --> 55:54.219
<i>You know what I found.</i>

55:55.811 --> 55:57.427
I don't need to go back over it.

56:01.567 --> 56:02.627
I think I'm done for the day,

56:02.651 --> 56:04.331
unless y'all wanna tell me
what's going on.

56:05.195 --> 56:07.107
What's going on
is the wrong man 10 years ago.

56:07.197 --> 56:09.359
No shit. But tell me why.

56:13.287 --> 56:16.155
Okay, I'll give y'all another
20 minutes some other time,

56:16.748 --> 56:18.239
and that's how we'll do this.

56:19.751 --> 56:21.367
Maybe we'll finish up by next summer.

56:25.007 --> 56:27.670
The girl, Julie.

56:27.885 --> 56:29.626
- Alan, I don't...
- What about her?

56:31.013 --> 56:34.302
Her prints went into the system
when they established the database.

56:39.146 --> 56:40.146
Okay.

56:40.230 --> 56:43.189
An after-hours burglary
in Sallisaw, Oklahoma.

56:43.859 --> 56:44.859
Two months ago.

56:45.694 --> 56:46.980
A Walgreens.

56:47.905 --> 56:49.567
Somebody broke into the pharmacy.

56:50.490 --> 56:52.482
PD worked the store for fingerprints.

56:54.286 --> 56:55.993
Only one set of prints hit.

56:57.956 --> 56:58.992
Julie Purcell's.

57:00.918 --> 57:01.918
Julie.

57:03.045 --> 57:04.877
- She's alive?
- Apparently.

57:06.548 --> 57:07.755
Jesus Christ.

57:13.931 --> 57:15.263
She's out there.

57:25.525 --> 57:26.606
Where you going?

57:27.903 --> 57:28.939
Back out.

57:30.864 --> 57:32.275
We have to find her.

57:35.202 --> 57:36.613
It's too dark, man.

57:37.704 --> 57:38.704
I don't care.
