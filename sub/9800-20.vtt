00:26.657 --> 00:28.614
Fetch me the royal thermometer.

00:29.027 --> 00:30.476
The thermometer says:

00:30.982 --> 00:31.982
Cold.

00:32.398 --> 00:34.445
We must ask the sky spirits

00:34.570 --> 00:36.608
to turn this freezy wind

00:36.942 --> 00:38.029
toasty.

00:38.542 --> 00:40.393
Great sky spirits.

00:42.158 --> 00:44.398
Maybe you should say:
"pretty please"?

00:45.502 --> 00:48.306
The royal feet are frostbited.

00:51.705 --> 00:55.210
Give me some options
for evening out these fierce tans.

00:55.544 --> 00:59.214
I suggest a 180-degree
horizontal axis rotation.

00:59.546 --> 01:01.535
Right. On my mark... flip.

01:03.652 --> 01:06.666
So, doctor,
you're studying penguins.

01:07.836 --> 01:10.360
It's my profession and my passion.

01:10.733 --> 01:14.011
I can't tell you how valuable
it will be to observe them

01:14.136 --> 01:17.501
under these harsh, unforgiving
and hard conditions.

01:17.669 --> 01:19.201
Whatever floats your root beer.

01:25.960 --> 01:28.246
Prepare to get served, boys.

01:40.539 --> 01:42.895
Let me know
if you see anything weird.

01:43.063 --> 01:43.963
Weird how?

01:46.245 --> 01:48.083
You'll know it if you see it, doc.

01:49.895 --> 01:52.087
They really are amazing creatures.

01:52.212 --> 01:53.641
A wind chill of 30 below,

01:53.809 --> 01:55.409
and look at them, loving it.

01:56.361 --> 01:58.540
Cute and cuddly, boys.

01:59.114 --> 02:00.315
Cute and cuddly.

02:02.316 --> 02:03.551
How cold is it?

02:03.719 --> 02:04.719
Kowalski?

02:05.479 --> 02:07.571
I can't say for certain,

02:07.918 --> 02:09.549
but I'd put the over-under

02:09.674 --> 02:12.232
at minus 17 degrees Fahrenheit.

02:13.350 --> 02:14.730
The freezing point of snot.

02:15.156 --> 02:17.140
I've lost all feeling
in me left cheek.

02:17.265 --> 02:20.737
That's my cheek, Private,
and the right one. But don't worry.

02:21.481 --> 02:23.840
This joker can't last much longer.

02:25.944 --> 02:27.344
I stand corrected.

02:35.937 --> 02:37.774
I don't think he's buying it.

02:38.717 --> 02:40.471
You got to sell it, Private.

02:42.596 --> 02:45.197
It's time to turn up the heat.

03:00.409 --> 03:03.384
This vapor rig should increase
the steam output

03:03.552 --> 03:06.888
by 700%, raising temperatures
all over the zoo.

03:16.459 --> 03:17.533
Outstanding.

03:17.750 --> 03:21.137
I just need to add a cooling line
to prevent the pressure from...

03:21.372 --> 03:22.405
<i>Emergency, alpha.</i>

03:22.703 --> 03:23.840
Emergency, alpha.

03:24.111 --> 03:25.508
Emergency! Alice!

03:29.592 --> 03:30.481
Got ya!

03:30.606 --> 03:33.408
I don't know where you go,
but you're not going anywhere now.

03:33.819 --> 03:37.296
It is essential
that they stay in the study area.

03:38.302 --> 03:39.793
Don't sweat it, Private.

03:39.918 --> 03:42.859
Better men than this guy have tried
to make me talk.

03:43.567 --> 03:44.567
Help.

03:48.030 --> 03:49.996
There! Lockdown!

03:50.937 --> 03:52.171
Good luck, doc.

03:53.340 --> 03:54.173
Not bad.

03:54.341 --> 03:56.409
Kind of flashy, actually.
What are they?

03:57.370 --> 03:59.169
Electronic tracking devices.

03:59.294 --> 04:01.114
Our every move will be monitored.

04:01.282 --> 04:02.553
That ain't gonna fly.

04:02.678 --> 04:04.662
No one can know
where we are at all times.

04:04.787 --> 04:07.026
Not even us.
Rico, hacksaw me.

04:08.957 --> 04:10.758
How long to saw
through the bracelet?

04:11.083 --> 04:13.361
The bracelet?
I was just gonna saw off my foot.

04:13.725 --> 04:15.530
Maybe you're onto something there.

04:15.844 --> 04:17.531
No! Tamper-resistant lining.

04:17.700 --> 04:19.601
You'll break the circuit,
sound the alarm.

04:19.769 --> 04:22.204
Boys, looks like
we got us a waiting game.

04:22.372 --> 04:24.039
We can't afford to wait.

04:24.307 --> 04:28.211
We left the furnace room
before I install the cooling upgrade.

04:28.379 --> 04:31.114
Without, the internal steam pressure
will built until...

04:31.415 --> 04:32.315
Kaboom.

04:32.483 --> 04:33.483
Oh, dear.

04:34.753 --> 04:37.199
- How long?
- Two hours, four minutes,

04:37.324 --> 04:39.123
unless we get finish the job.

04:39.629 --> 04:41.057
What about the scientist?

04:41.182 --> 04:43.771
Don't you think he'll notice
if any of us try to leave?

04:49.054 --> 04:50.080
Affirmative.

04:54.580 --> 04:55.775
Where did they go?

05:06.805 --> 05:09.082
We must thank the sky spirits

05:09.207 --> 05:13.155
for providing the warm coziness
we are now experiencing.

05:14.166 --> 05:16.964
If there is ever anything I can do,

05:17.297 --> 05:18.412
anything at...

05:19.721 --> 05:21.803
<i>There's something we need to you to.</i>

05:22.327 --> 05:23.505
You offered.

05:26.432 --> 05:28.234
Hi. Howdy.
Sky spirit?

05:29.513 --> 05:32.204
I never thought you'd sound
a little like a testy penguin.

05:32.329 --> 05:33.975
<i>Clam up, and listen to me.</i>

05:34.122 --> 05:36.278
A lot like a testy penguin,
actually.

05:36.403 --> 05:40.279
<i>Your kingdom is gonna blow up
in 1 hour and 47 minutes.</i>

05:41.492 --> 05:44.273
- A vengeful sky spirit.
- It's me, Skipper, you idiot.

05:44.398 --> 05:46.196
All right, just listen to the plan.

05:50.963 --> 05:52.870
Are you sure this is the place?

05:53.274 --> 05:55.306
It's very... steamy.

05:55.785 --> 05:57.030
Listen up, Ringtail.

05:57.155 --> 05:59.355
You have 1 hour and 12 minutes

05:59.480 --> 06:01.380
to install that cooling device.

06:01.861 --> 06:05.518
Is this including lunch,
coffee-breaking, and the royal siesta?

06:07.318 --> 06:09.529
Kowalski is gonna walk you
through it.

06:09.654 --> 06:11.356
Step-by-step.

06:11.633 --> 06:13.226
So do exactly what he says.

06:13.792 --> 06:14.861
I am royalty.

06:15.170 --> 06:16.330
I cannot be told

06:16.498 --> 06:17.704
<i>exactly what to do.</i>

06:17.829 --> 06:20.835
how about you order Kowalski
to tell you exactly what to do.

06:21.307 --> 06:22.370
That will work.

06:37.068 --> 06:38.621
Private, Rico, report.

06:39.221 --> 06:41.023
The scientist's getting suspicious.

06:41.347 --> 06:42.952
Enough with the smoke and mirrors.

06:43.077 --> 06:45.228
We need to start acting
like penguins.

06:45.396 --> 06:47.731
But we only know
the smile-and-wave routine.

06:47.899 --> 06:49.232
What else to penguins do?

06:49.540 --> 06:51.401
I don't have the faintest.

06:57.810 --> 06:58.810
I'm a wrench!

07:01.047 --> 07:02.480
The cooling unit's in place.

07:02.913 --> 07:05.198
Listen carefully,
if you open the lower casing,

07:05.323 --> 07:07.052
you'd see seven different knobs:

07:09.072 --> 07:12.625
<i>red, crimson, scarlet, brick,
cardinal, ruby, and rose.</i>

07:13.708 --> 07:15.061
<i>Make absolutely certain</i>

07:15.229 --> 07:18.257
<i>that you twist
only the scarlet knob,</i>

07:18.562 --> 07:20.386
<i>or it's bye-bye zoo.</i>

07:22.070 --> 07:24.972
Private, we need
some penguin material pronto.

07:26.032 --> 07:28.457
Try scratching the ground
and bobbing your heads.

07:28.582 --> 07:32.113
Take a running start, flap your wings,
leap up in the air and fly away!

07:33.441 --> 07:34.516
That's pigeons.

07:37.600 --> 07:39.821
- Eenie meenie minie...
<i>- We're running out of time.</i>

07:39.989 --> 07:42.591
<i>Have you twisted the knob?
Remember, only the scarlet knob.</i>

07:43.492 --> 07:45.094
- Where was I?
- "Moe."

07:45.469 --> 07:48.598
Are you eyeballs seeing
this color as scarlet, or is it brick?

07:48.766 --> 07:50.785
In this light,
that might be crimson.

07:50.910 --> 07:52.635
Crimson?
Then which is the ruby?

07:52.803 --> 07:55.138
Do I look like an interior decorator?
They're all red!

07:55.416 --> 07:56.817
Just twist the knob!

08:03.402 --> 08:05.850
Private, is this really necessary?

08:06.290 --> 08:10.017
Yes, it's critical to maintaining
social order within the flock.

08:10.178 --> 08:12.224
You preen Rico first,
and then he'll do you.

08:33.400 --> 08:34.400
I did it!

08:42.534 --> 08:44.264
Hypothetically, what would happen

08:44.389 --> 08:46.375
if we installed
that cooling unit thing

08:46.500 --> 08:50.078
onto the air conditioning system
instead of the furnace?

08:50.717 --> 08:53.348
<i>It'd create a chain pressure reaction
and take out half the city.</i>

08:53.473 --> 08:54.974
<i>- Why?</i>
- No reason.

08:55.099 --> 08:57.600
<i>The only way to stop it
would be to open the main water valve</i>

08:57.725 --> 08:59.188
<i>and flood the whole place.</i>

08:59.313 --> 09:02.212
Could you repeat the last part,
about stopping it?

09:02.380 --> 09:03.840
Flood the whole place.

09:05.245 --> 09:07.045
We have to get down there.

09:07.886 --> 09:09.387
Skipper, we can't.

09:09.752 --> 09:12.589
Alice would have us in nets
before we could get to them.

09:12.714 --> 09:13.925
It's up to the lemurs.

09:14.286 --> 09:15.410
The lemurs?

09:17.105 --> 09:18.138
Preening.

09:23.359 --> 09:25.738
We have to find that water main.
Look out!

09:25.906 --> 09:27.440
It's the only way.

09:27.964 --> 09:30.265
So start finding it, right now.

09:37.631 --> 09:40.753
Now is the time for you
to start volunteering a little bit.

09:42.324 --> 09:44.053
Very well, I guess that leaves...

09:45.194 --> 09:45.994
me?

10:07.164 --> 10:09.920
Male penguins now exhibiting
bizarre mating

10:10.088 --> 10:11.238
dance ritual.

10:24.626 --> 10:27.773
They did it!
Nice going, Ringtail.

10:29.081 --> 10:31.110
Mission accomplished.

10:31.498 --> 10:33.607
Over, under, and out.

10:39.827 --> 10:41.069
Sorry about this.

10:41.194 --> 10:43.470
There is a malfunction
in the central furnace.

10:43.595 --> 10:47.560
Don't worry. I've already compiled
more than enough data.

10:48.996 --> 10:50.869
And I also discovered

10:50.994 --> 10:53.534
a new method
of penguin communication:

10:54.210 --> 10:55.421
the "up high."

10:55.711 --> 10:57.463
This is the "down low",

10:58.282 --> 11:00.245
followed by the "too slow".
