01:08.199 --> 01:10.597
LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN,

01:10.665 --> 01:13.464
MICHELANGELO
THE MAGNIFICENT!

01:13.532 --> 01:16.163
THANK YOU, CAITLIN.

01:18.231 --> 01:20.463
I WILL NOW PERFORM

01:20.531 --> 01:23.463
MY FAMOUS
RABBIT-OUT-OF-A-HAT TRICK.

01:29.063 --> 01:32.429
AS YOU CAN SEE,
THE HAT IS EMPTY.

01:32.496 --> 01:34.395
LIKE YOUR HEAD.

01:36.862 --> 01:39.795
OH, NOT TRUE.
THAT HEAD'S
GOT SOME BRAINS,

01:39.862 --> 01:41.961
ONLY THEY'RE NOT
MICHELANGELO'S.

01:42.029 --> 01:43.828
COME ON, DUDES.

01:43.895 --> 01:47.660
I'M TRYING TO PERFORM
SOME SERIOUS MAGIC HERE.

01:47.728 --> 01:50.393
ABRACADABRA!

01:50.461 --> 01:52.593
RABBIT, APPEAR.

01:53.761 --> 01:57.126
WHOA! WELL, IT WAS HERE
A MINUTE AGO.

01:57.194 --> 01:59.526
HERE IT IS,
MICHELANGELO.

02:01.861 --> 02:04.693
RIGHT. WELL,
THAT WAS THE FAMOUS

02:04.760 --> 02:07.125
RABBIT-OFF-OF-MY-HEAD TRICK.

02:07.193 --> 02:09.792
WHOA, DUDES,
I'VE GOT MORE TRICKS.

02:09.860 --> 02:11.792
WE'VE SEEN ENOUGH.

02:11.860 --> 02:14.224
HOLY SMOKE!
THE GREAT BOLDINI SHOW

02:14.292 --> 02:15.924
AT THE MUSEUM
IS STARTING SOON.

02:15.992 --> 02:17.291
WE GOTTA GET GOING.

02:17.359 --> 02:18.791
WE WOULDN'T
MISS IT, KIDS.

02:18.859 --> 02:22.757
THIS BOLDINI
IS SUPPOSED TO BE
A REALLY GOOD MAGICIAN.

02:22.825 --> 02:25.823
RIGHT. I BET I COULD
DO HIS TRICKS.

02:25.891 --> 02:28.056
SURE YOU COULD.

02:28.124 --> 02:30.289
AND NOT ONLY IS TONIGHT
THE UNVEILING

02:30.357 --> 02:32.756
OF THE FABULOUS
TORTELLINI EMERALD,

02:32.824 --> 02:34.356
BUT ALSO OUR CITY'S
FIRST LOOK

02:34.424 --> 02:35.955
AT AN INCREDIBLE
MAGICIAN,

02:36.023 --> 02:37.921
THE GREAT BOLDINI.

02:37.989 --> 02:40.789
I HAVE HERE
THE CURATOR OF
THE CITY MUSEUM,

02:40.856 --> 02:42.588
DR. FISHFINE.

02:42.656 --> 02:43.955
TELL US ABOUT
THE FABULOUS

02:44.022 --> 02:45.622
TORTELLINI EMERALD,
DOCTOR.

02:45.689 --> 02:48.588
UH, YES. WELL,
IT'S, UH...UH, GREEN.

02:48.655 --> 02:52.287
IT'S, UH,
EXTREMELY VALUABLE.

02:52.489 --> 02:53.688
THAT'S ALL?

02:53.755 --> 02:55.454
UH, WELL, ACTUALLY,

02:55.522 --> 02:59.586
MY AREA OF EXPERTISE
IS PALEONTOLOGY,
MISS O'NEIL.

02:59.654 --> 03:01.753
I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT GEMS.

03:01.821 --> 03:04.386
STAY TUNED FOR
THE GREAT BOLDINI.

03:05.787 --> 03:06.919
HI, TURTLES.

03:06.987 --> 03:08.319
HOW YOU DOIN'?
All: HEY, APRIL!

03:08.386 --> 03:11.318
HI, ZACH. HEY,
WHO'S YOUR FRIEND?

03:11.386 --> 03:14.485
THIS IS CAITLIN. SHE WANTS
TO BE A TURTLE LIKE ME.

03:14.553 --> 03:18.518
I WANT TO BE
A TURTLE LIKE YOU,
MISS O'NEIL.

03:18.585 --> 03:22.284
WELL,
I'M NOT EXACTLY
A TURTLE, CAITLIN.

03:22.351 --> 03:24.317
SEE, APRIL'S MORE
OF AN ASSOCIATE TURTLE.

03:24.385 --> 03:25.950
IF SHE PASSES THE TEST,

03:26.018 --> 03:28.117
SHE GETS PROMOTED
TO SECOND ASSISTANT TURTLE,

03:28.184 --> 03:29.817
AHEAD OF MICHELANGELO.

03:29.885 --> 03:32.450
MONDO AMUSING, DUDE.

03:33.618 --> 03:36.549
AND NOW,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

03:36.617 --> 03:40.682
THE GREAT BOLDINI!

03:42.417 --> 03:45.148
THANK YOU,
THANK YOU.

03:45.150 --> 03:47.115
AND NOW, THE GREAT BOLDINI

03:47.183 --> 03:49.314
WILL PERFORM
HIS GREATEST ILLUSION.

03:49.483 --> 03:53.315
THE MUSEUM HAS
A STATE-OF-THE-ART
LASER ALARM SYSTEM.

03:53.382 --> 03:55.814
ARMED GUARDS ARE
POSTED AT EVERY EXIT.

03:55.881 --> 03:57.680
AND SURVEILLANCE MONITORS

03:57.748 --> 03:59.980
COVER EVERY CORNER
OF THE GEM ROOM.

04:00.048 --> 04:02.146
DESPITE THIS HIGH SECURITY,

04:02.214 --> 04:03.713
THE GREAT BOLDINI
WILL MAKE

04:03.781 --> 04:05.780
THE TORTELLINI
EMERALD VANISH

04:05.848 --> 04:08.013
BEFORE OUR VERY EYES.

04:16.480 --> 04:18.779
THAT EMERALD BELONGED
TO MY GRANDFATHER,

04:18.846 --> 04:21.144
TONY THE TICKLER
TURTELLI.

04:21.212 --> 04:23.644
THEN HOW COME
THEY GOT IT, BOSS?

04:23.712 --> 04:27.044
BECAUSE THE POLICE
CAUGHT HIM COMING OUT
OF THE MUSEUM WITH IT.

04:27.112 --> 04:30.711
BUT IT'S GOING TO BE BACK
IN THE FAMILY AGAIN.

04:30.779 --> 04:32.277
GET THE VAN READY, RODNEY.

04:32.345 --> 04:34.876
I'M GOING TO THE MUSEUM.

04:34.944 --> 04:37.677
AND NOW, LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN,

04:37.744 --> 04:39.643
THE VANISHING EMERALD.

04:43.810 --> 04:46.308
AND NOW...DISAPPEAR!

04:48.743 --> 04:50.642
THE VANISHING EMERALD.

04:50.710 --> 04:52.674
THIS IS APRIL O'NEIL,

04:52.742 --> 04:53.741
CHANNEL 6 NEWS,

04:53.809 --> 04:56.908
LIVE FROM THE CITY MUSEUM.
THAT CONCLUDES THE SHOW.

04:56.976 --> 05:00.240
SOMEBODY HIT ME
AND TIED ME UP!

05:00.308 --> 05:01.940
I DIDN'T FINISH
MY TRICK!

05:02.008 --> 05:05.107
THE TORTELLINI EMERALD
HAS BEEN...STOLEN!

05:05.309 --> 05:07.940
APRIL WAS WRONG.
THE SHOW ISN'T OVER,

05:08.141 --> 05:09.774
IT'S JUST BEGINNING.

05:09.974 --> 05:15.072
NOW, NOW. THERE'S
NO CAUSE FOR ALARM, FOLKS.

05:15.141 --> 05:18.072
BUT SOMEONE HERE
IS A DIRTY ROTTEN THIEF,

05:18.139 --> 05:21.105
AND WE'RE GOING TO
SEARCH EVERY ONE OF YOU
UNTIL WE FIND HIM.

05:21.173 --> 05:23.305
IF THEY SEARCH US,
DUDES,

05:23.373 --> 05:25.371
THEY'LL FIND
SOMETHING GREEN,

05:25.439 --> 05:27.371
BUT IT WON'T BE THE EMERALD!

05:27.439 --> 05:29.004
WE'LL HAVE TO FIND
A WAY OUT OF HERE

05:29.072 --> 05:30.638
BEFORE THAT HAPPENS.

05:30.706 --> 05:33.171
YOU KIDS GO WAIT
WITH APRIL
IN THE CONTROL ROOM.

05:33.472 --> 05:35.238
AW, WE WANT TO STAY
WITH YOU!

05:35.304 --> 05:39.169
YEAH. WE CAN KEEP
AN EYE OUT FOR
SUSPICIOUS PEOPLE.

05:39.238 --> 05:40.936
I'M AFRAID NOT, KIDS.

05:41.003 --> 05:42.603
AFTER THE POLICE
GET THROUGH HERE,

05:42.670 --> 05:44.103
APRIL WILL TAKE YOU HOME.

05:46.970 --> 05:48.402
ZACH, LOOK.

05:48.470 --> 05:50.968
THERE GOES
SOMEBODY SUSPICIOUS.

05:51.036 --> 05:52.602
IN MY MAGIC BOOK,

05:52.670 --> 05:54.602
THERE'S A TRICK
WHERE YOU CAN
TIE YOURSELF UP

05:54.670 --> 05:57.635
AND YOU WIND UP LOOKING
JUST LIKE BOLDINI DID.

05:57.703 --> 05:59.635
LET'S FOLLOW HIM.

05:59.703 --> 06:02.801
I DON'T KNOW.
LEONARDO SAID...

06:02.868 --> 06:06.401
<i>WHAT IF HE'S THE THIEF
AND WE HELP CATCH HIM?</i>

06:06.468 --> 06:08.267
WE'LL BE HEROES!

06:13.801 --> 06:16.099
HE WENT INTO
THAT STORAGE ROOM.

06:16.167 --> 06:17.899
LET'S GO.

06:20.301 --> 06:21.898
HE'S GONE!

06:21.967 --> 06:23.932
NOW, THAT'S
A MAGIC TRICK.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.399
WAIT A MINUTE.

06:25.466 --> 06:28.164
THIS GRATE IS LOOSE.

06:28.233 --> 06:30.797
BOLDINI MUST HAVE
GONE IN HERE.

06:30.865 --> 06:32.598
COME ON, CAITLIN.

06:32.732 --> 06:34.864
I BET HE WENT THIS WAY.

06:41.131 --> 06:43.963
WHAT A BIG
BASEMENT.

06:44.031 --> 06:46.764
I WONDER WHERE
BOLDINI WENT.

06:48.531 --> 06:51.163
NOW, WHERE IS IT?

06:53.330 --> 06:56.162
AH! I HAVE THE EMERALD!

06:56.229 --> 06:59.795
THANK YOU VERY MUCH,
COUSIN BOLDINI.

06:59.862 --> 07:03.528
MY PLEASURE,
COUSIN DON TURTELLI.

07:03.596 --> 07:06.994
DON TURTELLI?
THE TURTLES TOLD ME
ABOUT HIM.

07:07.062 --> 07:08.928
HE'S A BIG CROOK.

07:13.295 --> 07:16.093
O'FLAHERTY, HAVE HALF YOUR MEN
SECURE THE PERIMETER.

07:16.161 --> 07:17.759
RIGHT-O,
LIEUTENANT FRONSKI.

07:17.827 --> 07:20.393
I'LL PUT THEM
AROUND THE MUSEUM, TOO.

07:20.462 --> 07:22.026
THE REST COME WITH ME.

07:22.094 --> 07:24.760
WE GOTTA
WARN THE TURTLES.

07:24.827 --> 07:26.693
THIS LITTLE ELEVATOR
YOU INSTALLED

07:26.761 --> 07:29.526
UNDER THE DISPLAY CASE
WORKED GOOD.

07:29.593 --> 07:33.224
YEAH. ONE OF MY CONSTRUCTION
COMPANIES DID IT,

07:33.292 --> 07:37.158
AND THEY DUG THIS ESCAPE
ROUTE THROUGH THE SEWERS.

07:37.225 --> 07:38.458
I'M GETTING
OUT OF HERE.

07:38.526 --> 07:40.790
BUT YOU DID GOOD,
BOLDINI.

07:41.858 --> 07:44.124
TYING YOURSELF UP
REALLY FOOLED THEM.

07:44.191 --> 07:46.157
WE'VE GOT NO TIME
TO WARN THE TURTLES.

07:46.225 --> 07:47.224
HE'S GETTING AWAY.

07:48.757 --> 07:49.689
WHAT?

07:51.324 --> 07:53.256
COME BACK
WITH MY EMERALD.

07:53.324 --> 07:55.423
LIEUTENANT,
THESE MEN ARE WITH ME.

07:55.491 --> 07:57.022
YOU DON'T NEED
TO SEARCH THEM.

07:57.090 --> 08:01.189
MISS O'NEIL,
WE HAVE TO SEARCH
EVERYBODY, EVEN YOU.

08:01.257 --> 08:03.355
FAITH AND I'M SORRY,
MISS O'NEIL.

08:03.423 --> 08:05.756
IS THIS GONNA BE
A STRIP SEARCH?

08:05.823 --> 08:06.922
I HOPE NOT.

08:06.989 --> 08:08.389
THIS IS A FAMILY SHOW.

08:10.789 --> 08:11.887
DEAD END!

08:13.455 --> 08:14.920
GIVE ME THAT EMERALD,

08:14.988 --> 08:16.753
YOU LITTLE BRATS.

08:18.188 --> 08:19.620
HEY, WHAT THE...

08:19.687 --> 08:23.086
ALL RIGHT.
NO MORE PLAYING
HIDE-AND-SEEK.

08:23.154 --> 08:25.253
RIGHT. NOW WE PLAY
CUT-AND-RUN.

08:25.321 --> 08:28.553
THE NINJA TURTLES!
THEY MUST HAVE
STOLEN THE EMERALD!

08:28.620 --> 08:29.719
ARREST THEM!

08:37.719 --> 08:41.751
DO YOU DUDES REALIZE
WHAT THIS IS GOING TO DO
TO OUR REPS?

08:41.885 --> 08:43.950
WE CAN'T ALLOW
OURSELVES
TO GET ARRESTED.

08:44.018 --> 08:44.950
YOU'RE RIGHT.

08:45.018 --> 08:46.917
I LOOK TERRIBLE IN STRIPES.

08:51.852 --> 08:52.784
GIVE ME THAT!

08:52.852 --> 08:54.650
SURE. CATCH.

08:54.785 --> 08:56.383
NO! DON'T THROW IT!

08:56.617 --> 08:57.850
RUN, ZACH.

09:00.283 --> 09:01.549
I GOT YOU.

09:01.617 --> 09:03.816
LET GO OF ME,
YOU CREEP.

09:04.117 --> 09:06.516
HEY, KID.
LET'S MAKE A TRADE.

09:06.583 --> 09:08.648
YOU GIVE ME
THE TORTELLINI
EMERALD,

09:08.783 --> 09:11.115
I GIVE YOU BACK
YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

09:11.182 --> 09:13.582
SHE'S NOT
MY GIRLFRIEND.

09:13.649 --> 09:17.315
I AIN'T GOT TIME
TO DISCUSS YOUR
RELATIONSHIPS, KID.

09:17.382 --> 09:18.348
GIVE ME THAT EMERALD

09:18.415 --> 09:20.747
OR SHE'LL SUFFER
THE CONSEQUENCES.

09:22.415 --> 09:24.879
TAKE THEIR WEAPONS
AND PUT THE CUFFS ON 'EM.

09:25.115 --> 09:28.513
OH, NO. THEY'RE
ARRESTING THE TURTLES.

09:29.781 --> 09:33.113
YOU'LL COME ALONG QUIETLY,
MY GREEN LADS.

09:33.180 --> 09:34.812
WHAT'S THE MATTER, DUDE,

09:34.947 --> 09:38.045
HAVEN'T YOU EVER SEEN
4-FOOT-TALL TURTLES BEFORE?

09:38.114 --> 09:39.245
FAITH AND BEGORRAH!

09:40.680 --> 09:42.178
THE LITTLE PEOPLE!

09:42.246 --> 09:43.445
SEAN,

09:43.513 --> 09:45.911
I KNOW WE'RE SHORT,
BUT NOT THAT SHORT.

09:45.979 --> 09:48.279
YOU'VE GOT
THE WRONG PEOPLE
HERE, LIEUTENANT.

09:48.345 --> 09:50.177
THEY DON'T NEED
ANY EMERALD.

09:50.245 --> 09:52.043
THEY'VE GOT
POTS O' GOLD.

09:52.112 --> 09:54.777
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT O'FLAHERTY?

09:54.778 --> 09:56.510
THEY'RE LEPRECHAUNS.

09:56.578 --> 09:58.443
YOU ARE NUTS!

09:58.611 --> 10:00.209
TURTLES, NOW!

10:01.177 --> 10:03.042
TURTLE POWER!

10:03.111 --> 10:04.276
COME BACK!

10:04.344 --> 10:07.009
STOP!
I DIDN'T GET MY WISH!

10:07.077 --> 10:10.275
IN AN AMAZING TURN
OF EVENTS,
POLICE HAVE ARRESTED

10:10.343 --> 10:12.576
THE TEENAGE MUTANT
NINJA TURTLES
FOR THE THEFT

10:12.643 --> 10:14.375
OF THE THE TORTELLINI
EMERALD.

10:14.443 --> 10:15.409
SO LONG, APRIL.

10:15.477 --> 10:16.874
MIND IF WE
TAKE YOUR VAN?

10:16.943 --> 10:18.941
STOP, TURTLES!

10:19.009 --> 10:20.940
HALT, LEPRECHAUNS.

10:21.008 --> 10:22.441
UH, CORRECTION.

10:22.509 --> 10:24.774
THE TEENAGE MUTANT
NINJA TURTLES

10:24.841 --> 10:26.607
HAVE ESCAPED
POLICE CUSTODY.

10:27.708 --> 10:29.774
STOP!
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST!

10:31.508 --> 10:35.939
CAR 3-9 REPORTING
4 ESCAPED...UH...
LITTLE GREEN MEN.

10:36.007 --> 10:38.205
LEPRECHAUNS.
NOW, AFTER THEM.

10:41.073 --> 10:42.406
ALL RIGHT, KID.

10:42.474 --> 10:44.705
THIS IS
YOUR LAST CHANCE.

10:44.773 --> 10:47.538
COME OUT NOW
OR THE GIRL GETS IT.

10:47.773 --> 10:49.138
PROMISE YOU'LL LET US GO?

10:49.206 --> 10:50.937
DON'T DO IT,
ZACH!

10:50.939 --> 10:52.937
WHERE DO YOU WANT
IT, BLONDIE?

10:53.005 --> 10:55.604
UNDER YOUR ARM?
THE SOLES OF YOUR
FEET?

10:55.605 --> 10:57.604
OH, I CAN'T WATCH.

10:57.672 --> 10:59.304
ALL RIGHT, YOU RATS.

10:59.371 --> 11:00.304
RATS?

11:00.439 --> 11:02.471
DID SOMEONE CALL?

11:03.538 --> 11:05.203
GREETINGS, HUMANS.

11:05.305 --> 11:07.703
I AM THE RAT KING.

11:07.770 --> 11:09.703
WHAT'S THE MEANING
OF THIS?

11:09.770 --> 11:10.902
THE RAT KING?

11:10.970 --> 11:12.303
AND WHICH ONE
OF THESE

11:12.370 --> 11:14.635
IS YOUR RAT QUEEN,
BANDAGE FACE?

11:16.370 --> 11:19.402
HOW DARE YOU MOCK
MY ROYAL MAJESTY?

11:21.702 --> 11:23.235
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,

11:23.303 --> 11:26.234
CALL OFF THE DOGS--
UH, RATS.

11:26.269 --> 11:27.767
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

11:27.835 --> 11:30.601
YOU HAVE BUILT A TUNNEL
IN MY ROYAL DOMAIN

11:30.668 --> 11:32.434
WITHOUT MY PERMISSION.

11:32.502 --> 11:34.700
YOUR DOMAIN
IS IN THE SEWER?

11:34.767 --> 11:37.067
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TRESPASSED,

11:37.134 --> 11:39.066
YOU MUST PAY A TAX,

11:39.134 --> 11:42.632
AND I THINK THAT EMERALD
WILL DO VERY NICELY.

11:42.700 --> 11:44.200
ARE YOU KIDDING?
THAT'S MY EMERALD.

11:44.267 --> 11:46.399
I'LL NEVER GIVE IT
TO YOU.

11:46.600 --> 11:49.865
I'D LIKE-A TO POINT OUT
THE TORTELLINI EMERALD

11:49.933 --> 11:51.698
NOW BELONGS TO
THE TWO LITTLE KIDS,

11:51.766 --> 11:53.932
AND YOU'VE JUST-A
LET 'EM ESCAPE!

11:54.999 --> 11:56.932
THE POLICE ARE
CATCHING UP!

11:56.999 --> 12:00.931
IF WE CAN MAKE IT
TO OUR SEWER ENTRANCE,
WE'LL BE OK.

12:03.432 --> 12:05.797
I NEVER THOUGHT
THIS WOULD HAPPEN.

12:05.865 --> 12:08.063
WE'RE FUGITIVES
FROM JUSTICE.

12:08.265 --> 12:09.896
TURTLES ON THE LAM,

12:09.964 --> 12:11.729
RUNNING FROM THE COPS,

12:11.797 --> 12:13.563
HUNTED NIGHT AND DAY.

12:14.864 --> 12:16.296
DONATELLO HERE.

12:16.431 --> 12:17.928
ARE YOU GUYS ALL RIGHT?

12:17.996 --> 12:19.896
WE WILL BE IF MICHELANGELO
STOPS PRETENDING

12:19.963 --> 12:21.695
HE'S IN A GANGSTER MOVIE.

12:21.763 --> 12:23.428
I'VE BEEN LOOKING
FOR ZACH AND CAITLIN.

12:23.496 --> 12:24.428
HAVE YOU SEEN 'EM?

12:24.496 --> 12:26.529
WE SENT THEM
TO STAY WITH YOU.

12:26.596 --> 12:29.928
THEN THE LITTLE DUDES MUST
STILL BE INSIDE THE MUSEUM.

12:29.996 --> 12:32.694
NO SIGN OF THOSE
BRATS ANYWHERE.

12:32.762 --> 12:35.861
I'LL FIND THEM FOR YOU,
FOR A PRICE.

12:36.029 --> 12:39.127
SURE, ANYTHING.
JUST GET THAT EMERALD.

12:39.195 --> 12:40.860
GO, MY LOYAL SUBJECTS.

12:40.928 --> 12:42.360
FIND THOSE CHILDREN,

12:42.428 --> 12:45.760
AND KEEP EVERYONE ELSE
OUT OF THE MUSEUM.

12:47.327 --> 12:49.692
WHERE ARE THEY GOING?

12:49.760 --> 12:52.025
TO THE MUSEUM'S COMPUTER ROOM

12:52.094 --> 12:55.392
TO MAKE SURE
WE'RE NOT DISTURBED.

13:03.159 --> 13:04.424
RATS!

13:07.925 --> 13:09.391
AFTER THE RAT ATTACK,

13:09.459 --> 13:11.757
SOMETHING OR SOMEONE

13:11.825 --> 13:14.290
HAS REPROGRAMMED
THE MUSEUM'S
SECURITY COMPUTERS,

13:14.357 --> 13:16.557
CLOSING ALL DOORS
AND WINDOWS.

13:16.625 --> 13:20.056
THE FUGITIVE TEENAGE
MUTANT NINJA TURTLES
ARE BEING BLAMED.

13:20.124 --> 13:23.189
THIS IS APRIL O'NEIL
FOR CHANNEL 6 NEWS.

13:26.989 --> 13:29.055
WHAT'S GOING ON
OVER THERE?

13:29.122 --> 13:32.655
YOU GUYS ARE ON
THE 10-MOST-WANTED LIST.

13:32.723 --> 13:35.288
THE SECURITY SYSTEM
WENT HAYWIRE, AND--

13:35.355 --> 13:37.554
FELLAS,
CHECK THIS OUT.

13:37.622 --> 13:39.987
TURTELLI MUSEUM
REMODELING.

13:40.055 --> 13:41.554
DON TURTELLI.

13:41.622 --> 13:44.521
RIGHT. HE MUST BE BEHIND
THIS GEM THEFT.

13:44.588 --> 13:47.186
AND CHANCES ARE
HE'S STILL IN THE MUSEUM...

13:47.422 --> 13:48.653
WITH THE KIDS!

13:50.255 --> 13:51.586
WHERE ARE WE GOING?

13:51.654 --> 13:53.586
THE FRONT DOOR'S
JUST AHEAD.

13:53.654 --> 13:55.052
THIS WAY.

13:55.120 --> 13:56.519
THEY'RE COMING!

13:59.454 --> 14:01.885
OHH, IT'S LOCKED.
NOW WHAT?

14:01.953 --> 14:05.385
WE GOTTA HIDE THIS
EMERALD...BUT WHERE?

14:05.453 --> 14:08.452
THE LAST PLACE
THEY'D EVER LOOK FOR IT.

14:08.519 --> 14:09.385
COME ON.

14:10.452 --> 14:11.618
IT GETS WORSE, GUYS.

14:11.685 --> 14:14.083
THERE'S NO WAY
INTO THE MUSEUM.

14:14.151 --> 14:16.783
AND THERE SEEMS TO BE
AN INVASION OF RATS!

14:16.851 --> 14:18.083
RATS?

14:18.151 --> 14:19.983
THAT MEANS THAT ZACH
AND CAITLIN

14:20.051 --> 14:21.083
ARE IN THERE WITH
DON TURTELLI

14:21.151 --> 14:23.050
AND THE RAT KING!

14:23.117 --> 14:24.717
AND WE CAN'T
GET TO THEM!

14:31.283 --> 14:33.148
YOU BRATS ARE GONNA
TELL ME

14:33.216 --> 14:34.716
WHERE YOU STASHED
THAT EMERALD

14:34.783 --> 14:37.715
OR YOU'LL BE
VERY SORRY.

14:39.283 --> 14:40.715
I--I ALREADY AM!

14:51.915 --> 14:54.246
I'M WORRIED ABOUT
THOSE LITTLE DUDES.

14:54.314 --> 14:56.279
HOW ARE WE
GONNA GET IN?

14:56.347 --> 14:57.879
DON TURTELLI
HAS TO HAVE SOME WAY

14:57.947 --> 14:59.313
OF GETTING
THE TORTELLINI EMERALD

14:59.379 --> 15:00.913
OUT OF THE MUSEUM,

15:00.981 --> 15:02.846
AND IT WOULDN'T BE
BY THE DOOR.

15:05.746 --> 15:07.878
HE GOT IN
THROUGH THE SEWER.

15:08.113 --> 15:09.678
THEN HE COULD
ALREADY BE GONE!

15:09.746 --> 15:11.812
HE WOULDN'T
LEAVE THIS TRUCK HERE.

15:11.879 --> 15:13.010
LET'S GO, FELLAS.

15:13.078 --> 15:14.911
HOLD IT RIGHT THERE,

15:14.978 --> 15:17.277
YOU WRETCHED
BLARNEY DEVILS.

15:17.345 --> 15:18.844
WRETCHED...WHAT?

15:18.912 --> 15:22.177
I KNEW YOU'D RETURN
TO THE SCENE
OF THE CRIME.

15:22.245 --> 15:24.043
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST,
THE LOT OF YA.

15:24.111 --> 15:26.209
MISS O'NEIL,
I CAN ONLY HOPE

15:26.277 --> 15:27.776
YOU'RE HERE
AGAINST YOUR WILL.

15:27.844 --> 15:29.109
YOU'RE
TOO PRETTY A LASS

15:29.177 --> 15:30.709
TO BE MIXED UP WITH
THE LIKES OF THESE.

15:30.777 --> 15:33.109
SERGEANT, YOU'VE
GOT TO BELIEVE ME.

15:33.177 --> 15:36.076
THESE TURTLES DID NOT STEAL
THE TORTELLINI EMERALD.

15:36.277 --> 15:39.308
IF YOU LET 'EM GO, THEY'LL
CAPTURE THE ONES WHO DID!

15:39.443 --> 15:41.274
SERGEANT, GIVE US AN HOUR.

15:41.342 --> 15:44.941
IF WE CAN'T CATCH THOSE CROOKS,
WE'LL TURN OURSELVES IN.

15:45.009 --> 15:46.774
IF LIEUTENANT
FRONSKI KNEW I

15:46.842 --> 15:49.174
LET YA GET AWAY
AGAIN, HE'D...

15:49.241 --> 15:51.173
YOU'VE GOT ONE HOUR!

15:51.241 --> 15:52.974
THANKS, SERGEANT.

15:59.974 --> 16:01.706
NO--NO MORE!

16:01.775 --> 16:04.872
THEN TELL US
WHERE YOU HID
THE TORTELLINI EMERALD.

16:08.606 --> 16:09.872
NEVER!

16:09.940 --> 16:12.371
I CAN'T STAND
TO WATCH.

16:12.440 --> 16:15.871
I'M GOING TO PICK UP
SOME ARTSY STUFF

16:15.939 --> 16:17.905
TO DECORATE
MY KINGDOM.

16:22.938 --> 16:25.870
SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THIS ONE?

16:27.704 --> 16:28.904
WHAT ABOUT
THIS ONE?

16:31.671 --> 16:33.836
I THOUGHT SO.

16:33.904 --> 16:35.903
THE RAT KING!

16:35.970 --> 16:38.169
I THOUGHT
I SMELLED A RAT.

16:38.236 --> 16:41.835
FOR THAT
YOU WILL SUFFER.

16:45.070 --> 16:47.568
SMOKE BOMB!

16:47.636 --> 16:49.769
I HATE IT
WHEN HE DOES THAT.

16:49.836 --> 16:52.534
HE'S GONE.

16:53.602 --> 16:55.034
THAT'S THE KIDS!

16:57.169 --> 17:00.667
CLIMATE
CONTROL COMPUTER.

17:00.735 --> 17:02.234
YES, MY PETS,

17:02.301 --> 17:04.333
GIVE THEM SOME WEATHER
TO TALK ABOUT.

17:09.567 --> 17:12.299
THEIR VOICES
CAME FROM THIS DIRECTION.

17:20.832 --> 17:24.098
THIS IS OUTDOOR
WEATHER, DUDES.

17:24.165 --> 17:25.864
SOMEBODY
HAS REPROGRAMMED

17:25.932 --> 17:27.598
THE MUSEUM'S
CLIMATE CONTROLS!

17:28.665 --> 17:29.930
HAD ENOUGH?

17:29.998 --> 17:33.897
OH, ALL RIGHT,
I'LL TE--I'LL TELL.

17:33.965 --> 17:35.396
WHERE IS IT?

17:36.664 --> 17:41.329
THE TORTELLINI EMERALD,
BACK IN THE FAMILY AGAIN.

17:42.397 --> 17:44.462
COME ON, CAITLIN! RUN!

17:44.530 --> 17:46.195
COME BACK HERE, YOU!

17:46.363 --> 17:47.696
NEVER MIND THEM.
WE'VE GOT THE EMERALD.

17:47.763 --> 17:49.028
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

17:50.429 --> 17:52.528
IF WE DON'T
GET OUT OF THIS SNOW,

17:52.596 --> 17:55.327
WE'RE GONNA FREEZE
OUR SHELLS OFF!

17:55.395 --> 17:57.461
DUDES,
IF WE HAVE TO GO,

17:57.528 --> 18:00.861
LET'S AT LEAST DO IT
BY A PICTURE
OF MALIBU.

18:00.928 --> 18:04.426
MICHELANGELO!
LEONARDO!

18:04.494 --> 18:06.727
HEY, THAT SOUNDED
LIKE ZACH'S VOICE.

18:06.795 --> 18:08.560
IT CAME
FROM UP AHEAD.

18:08.628 --> 18:09.560
HELP! HELP!

18:09.628 --> 18:11.960
CAITLIN! ZACH!

18:12.027 --> 18:13.393
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT NOW.

18:13.460 --> 18:14.960
BUT DON TURTELLI

18:15.027 --> 18:17.459
AND BOLDINI ARE GETTING AWAY
WITH THE EMERALD!

18:17.527 --> 18:18.692
THE GREAT BOLDINI?

18:18.761 --> 18:21.292
I KNEW THAT DUDE
WAS A CROOK.

18:21.360 --> 18:22.524
WHY?

18:22.592 --> 18:25.424
'CAUSE HE WASN'T
THAT GREAT A MAGICIAN.

18:25.492 --> 18:26.792
WE'VE GOTTA
TURN OFF THIS WEATHER!

18:26.860 --> 18:28.792
BUT HOW?

18:28.859 --> 18:30.724
MY SCHOOL TOURED
THIS MUSEUM.

18:30.792 --> 18:32.924
I KNOW WHERE
THE COMPUTER ROOM IS!

18:32.992 --> 18:35.924
I'LL SHOW YOU THE SECRET WAY
DOWN TO THE BASEMENT!

18:35.992 --> 18:38.758
DONATELLO,
YOU TAKE CAITLIN
AND FIX THE COMPUTER.

18:38.824 --> 18:40.590
WE'LL CATCH
THOSE CROOKS.

18:40.657 --> 18:43.623
WHERE THE HECK
IS THAT OPENING?

18:43.690 --> 18:46.123
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO PUT IT
IN THE FLOOR-A.

18:46.257 --> 18:48.556
HEY, I WASN'T
EXPECTING IT TO SNOW.

18:48.691 --> 18:51.289
YOUR WEATHER REPORT
JUST GOT WORSE.

18:51.356 --> 18:55.354
RIGHT. NOW IT'S SNOW
WITH A CHANCE OF TURTLES.

18:55.422 --> 18:56.521
THE TURTLES!

18:56.589 --> 18:58.021
NOW WHAT?

18:58.089 --> 18:59.522
COME ON, TURTLES!

19:00.822 --> 19:03.288
TRY AND GET ME,
SHELLS FOR BRAINS.

19:03.354 --> 19:05.186
YEAH, COME ON!

19:07.255 --> 19:09.287
THIS MEANS WAR!

19:13.554 --> 19:15.720
AH, WHAT A MESS.

19:15.855 --> 19:18.620
WE'LL NEVER GET THIS
CLIMATE CONTROL COMPUTER
WORKING.

19:18.687 --> 19:21.753
MAYBE WE CAN LINK UP
THE CLIMATE CONTROLS

19:21.820 --> 19:23.919
TO ONE OF THESE
OTHER COMPUTERS.

19:23.987 --> 19:25.485
HEY, IT MIGHT WORK.

19:25.553 --> 19:27.518
SAY, YOU'RE PRETTY GOOD.

19:27.586 --> 19:29.118
IF YOU'RE GONNA SAY,
"FOR A GIRL,"

19:29.185 --> 19:32.184
FORGET IT.

19:36.585 --> 19:38.518
DIDN'T YOU, LIKE,
ASK THOSE GUYS

19:38.585 --> 19:40.384
TO FIX THE WEATHER?

19:42.252 --> 19:45.216
THIS MUST BE
BOLDINI'S MAGIC STUFF.

19:45.284 --> 19:47.283
MICHELANGELO!

19:48.250 --> 19:51.050
MAYBE
WE CAN USE THESE.

19:51.117 --> 19:52.716
THERE'S THE OPENING.

19:52.784 --> 19:54.449
LET'S GO.

19:57.749 --> 20:00.248
SORRY!
WHAT'S GOING ON?

20:00.316 --> 20:02.548
THERE.
THAT SHOULD DO IT.

20:02.616 --> 20:04.548
OK. I'VE GOT THE
CLIMATE CIRCUIT SET.

20:04.616 --> 20:05.848
LET'S TRY IT.

20:09.115 --> 20:11.781
CAITLIN AND DONATELLO
MUST HAVE FIXED
THE COMPUTER.

20:11.848 --> 20:14.881
BUT DON TURTELLI AND BOLDINI
ARE GETTING AWAY.

20:15.081 --> 20:17.246
NOT IF I CAN HELP IT.

20:17.314 --> 20:18.679
STOP!

20:18.914 --> 20:20.546
GET OUT OF THE WAY,
KID, OR--

20:20.614 --> 20:23.913
JEWEL, RETURN TO YOUR
RIGHTFUL PLACE.

20:25.247 --> 20:28.213
THAT'S-A MY TRICK.

20:28.114 --> 20:29.912
NO WAY.

20:29.980 --> 20:34.411
MICHELANGELO THE MAGNIFICENT
WILL STOP YOU

20:34.479 --> 20:37.878
WITH THESE MAGICAL
ROPES OF STEEL.

20:39.645 --> 20:40.744
MY PIGEONS.

20:40.812 --> 20:43.011
G-GET OUT A HERE.

20:43.078 --> 20:45.343
MAGICAL ROPES
OF STEEL?

20:45.411 --> 20:47.877
OH, MAYBE I PUT ON
THE WRONG HAT.

20:49.678 --> 20:52.043
BUT THIS IS
THE RIGHT ROPE.

20:56.143 --> 20:57.576
LET ME GO!

20:57.643 --> 21:00.576
I WANT TO CALL
MY LAWYER.

21:00.643 --> 21:03.676
HEY GUYS, WE GOT
THE MUSEUM DOORS OPEN.

21:03.743 --> 21:06.108
SO WE BETTER LEAVE
AND AVOID THE CROWDS.

21:06.176 --> 21:08.275
WHAT IN THE DEVIL'S
GOIN' ON?

21:08.342 --> 21:10.641
THE TEENAGE MUTANT
NINJA TURTLES

21:10.709 --> 21:13.240
JUST CAUGHT
YOUR JEWEL THIEF,
SERGEANT.

21:15.075 --> 21:17.840
O'FLAHERTY,
ARE YOU DOWN THERE?

21:17.908 --> 21:20.673
COME ON, TURTLES,
TIME FOR US TO GO.

21:23.341 --> 21:24.573
COVER FOR US, APRIL.

21:24.641 --> 21:26.073
DON'T I ALWAYS?

21:26.141 --> 21:28.006
O'FLAHERTY?

21:28.074 --> 21:29.939
AND I COULDN'T HAVE
CAPTURED THESE CROOKS

21:30.007 --> 21:31.238
WITHOUT THE HELP OF...

21:31.240 --> 21:34.706
THE TEENAGE MUTANT
NINJA LEPRECHAUNS.

21:36.106 --> 21:38.172
THAT'S US,
