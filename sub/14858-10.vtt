00:02.669 --> 00:04.376
So the boy in The Sixth Sense
dies at the end?

00:04.671 --> 00:05.832
No, the sixth sense is love.

00:06.131 --> 00:08.042
Guys, spoilers.
The movie's 12 years old.

00:08.342 --> 00:10.629
Never gonna believe who
| ran into at the drug store.

00:10.928 --> 00:11.963
An old lady buying shampoo?

00:12.262 --> 00:13.673
A guy who works
in the drug store?

00:13.972 --> 00:16.885
Yes. Also, Mr. Fitzgerald,
my favorite high school teacher.

00:17.184 --> 00:18.265
He was the coolest.

00:18.560 --> 00:20.301
| mean, he used to let us
call him Alan.

00:20.604 --> 00:22.436
Okay, Dave had two pictures
in his locker,

00:22.731 --> 00:24.267
Neve Campbell
and Mr. Fitzgerald.

00:24.566 --> 00:27.354
He taught us that comic books
were just as literary as novels.

00:27.653 --> 00:29.143
[SIGHS]
He wore sandals to class.

00:29.446 --> 00:31.028
Pump the brakes,
Dead Poets Society.

00:31.323 --> 00:33.064
He used to say,
"Dave, chase your dreams.

00:33.367 --> 00:34.778
Don't let your dreams
chase you."

00:35.077 --> 00:36.533
We get it, he touched you.
Really?

00:36.828 --> 00:38.410
It's not your fault, Dave.

00:38.705 --> 00:41.117
Dave, it's not your fault.
Stop Good Will Hunting me.

00:41.416 --> 00:43.032
Stop comparing me to
Robin Williams movies, period.

00:44.086 --> 00:46.498
Come on, we just opened up.
What's happening here?

00:46.797 --> 00:48.037
It's a new coffee shop,
Nick's Coffee and Tea.

00:49.091 --> 00:51.253
The neighborhood could use
a good coffee shop.

00:51.552 --> 00:52.713
It's not a shop, it's a chain.

00:53.011 --> 00:54.877
Got over 300 stores
on the West Coast alone.

00:55.180 --> 00:57.717
A coffee chain is a clear
indication of gentrification.

00:58.016 --> 01:00.007
Do you know what that means?
Pumpkin lattes.

01:00.310 --> 01:01.641
It means our rent goes up.

01:01.937 --> 01:04.519
It means organic grocery stores.
It means families, Dave.

01:04.815 --> 01:05.896
[CAR HORNS]

01:06.191 --> 01:08.603
Families.
Aah, warm buttermilk scones.

01:08.902 --> 01:11.360
Alex, you of all people
should be concerned about this.

01:11.655 --> 01:14.272
A chain store is the enemy
of the small business owner.

01:14.575 --> 01:17.033
You're right. I never thought
about that before.

01:17.327 --> 01:19.739
The first coffee I ever
had was in Fitzgerald's class.

01:20.038 --> 01:22.279
He let us drink it
during great books discussions.

01:22.583 --> 01:23.914
[CAR HORNS]

01:24.209 --> 01:26.826
Okay. Show me on the cup man
where he touched you.

Dave, this sandwich is bananas.
Thanks, Pen.

would pick up.

01:44.771 --> 01:46.011
Well, success takes time.

01:46.315 --> 01:48.181
"Roam" by the B-52s
wasn't written in a day.

01:48.483 --> 01:50.144
Know what you should do
for publicity?

01:50.444 --> 01:52.105
Enter that
big food truck competition

01:52.404 --> 01:53.986
they have every year.
The Truckies?

01:54.281 --> 01:56.147
My sandwiches aren't
flashy enough.

01:56.450 --> 01:57.736
Not like that damn bahn mi truck

01:58.035 --> 01:59.867
and their stupid, delicious,
tangy mayo.

02:00.162 --> 02:03.245
No way! Mr. Fitzgerald!

02:03.540 --> 02:06.578
Call me Alan.
Alan. Still a thrill.

02:06.877 --> 02:08.493
I'm so glad you decided
to come by.

02:08.794 --> 02:11.253
You remember my friend,
Penny Hartz, from high school?

02:11.548 --> 02:15.212
How could I forget? You were
so intense and misunderstood.

02:15.510 --> 02:16.716
| really was.
Yeah.

02:17.012 --> 02:19.424
So this is for you.
Oh.

02:19.723 --> 02:21.555
| don't know if you noticed
the truck here,

02:21.850 --> 02:24.683
but I'm kind of living my dream,
you know, like Kerouac.

02:24.978 --> 02:26.969
My office is on the road.
Stupid.

02:27.272 --> 02:28.512
Dave, this is really good.

02:28.815 --> 02:29.896
Really good.
Yeah.

02:30.192 --> 02:31.933
Know what would take it
to the next level?

02:32.235 --> 02:34.602
This si-io khao tamarind slaw
that I learned to make

02:34.905 --> 02:36.737
when I was building orphanages
in Phuket.

02:37.032 --> 02:38.113
Ooh, exotic.

02:38.408 --> 02:40.115
The legend has it
that the locals used it

02:40.410 --> 02:42.151
as a powerful aphrodisiac.
Listening.

02:42.454 --> 02:45.321
If the measurements are slightly
off, it becomes a diuretic.

02:45.624 --> 02:46.705
Ugh.
Ooh.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.411
| really think that
those flavors

02:48.710 --> 02:50.451
would intensify
the taste of this steak.

02:50.754 --> 02:53.587
Exotic slaw might be what I need
to take it to the next level.

02:53.882 --> 02:55.122
Sounds slawsome.

02:55.425 --> 02:57.166
[CHUCKLES]
| don't know why I said that.

02:57.469 --> 02:58.925
That's a great joke.
Yeah?

with this person.

Jay Mohr with me.

Why is Jay Mohr always
your go-to for cool?

Brad, only idiots hire people
based on charm.

03:23.578 --> 03:25.410
Then every boss
I've ever had is an idiot,

been up against me for a job

turned back on.

I"m not paying for it.
Please, I have no money, Brad.

Alan was a huge part of my life.

04:49.748 --> 04:51.409
We spent hours together
after school.

04:51.708 --> 04:53.745
He taught me about books,
art and love.

04:54.044 --> 04:56.331
He didn't touch me,
but he was always there for me.

04:56.630 --> 04:59.292
So not really clear
what my marching orders are.

04:59.591 --> 05:01.207
