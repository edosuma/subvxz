'You're so boring!'

01:14.840 --> 01:15.880
Glenn?

01:58.320 --> 02:00.159
Hey, morning.
Life-saver.

02:00.160 --> 02:02.960
Got an early one.
No problem, go!

02:08.400 --> 02:10.640
Dad!
Hey, you all right?

02:11.600 --> 02:14.839
Breakfast, what do you want?
Eggs, porridge or cereal?

02:14.840 --> 02:17.199
You know I'm an expert in all three.
Since when?

02:17.200 --> 02:18.999
Well, since I went
to cooking school.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.839
You did not go to cooking school.

02:20.840 --> 02:23.319
Yes, I did go to cooking school.
Hold on, you calling me a liar?

02:23.320 --> 02:25.159
Yeah. Yeah!
What you saying? No, no.

02:25.160 --> 02:27.879
You saying Daddy's a liar?
I'm not a liar! I'm not a liar!

02:27.880 --> 02:30.960
Do it a little bit, not all the way
over it, like that. That's nice.

02:32.040 --> 02:34.320
Right, kids.
Get your stuff, let's go!

02:47.120 --> 02:50.080

Would you? That'd be amazing.

02:52.040 --> 02:53.680
Look, Ari,
I just wanted to say that...

02:55.080 --> 02:56.119
..I'm ready.

02:56.120 --> 02:57.520
To talk...

02:58.840 --> 03:01.800
..move back in. I don't know,
make a plan to move back in?

03:03.760 --> 03:06.120
OK. Good to know.

Oh, come on, this is silly.

03:10.240 --> 03:12.559
Look, you said you wanted
your space, and all right, fine,

03:12.560 --> 03:14.879
I ran away to Roy's,
but come on, we can fix this.

03:14.880 --> 03:18.199
I'm just not there yet, Glenn.
That's all I can tell you.

03:18.200 --> 03:21.160
Why is it that I'm being pushed out
and I'm not the one who cheated?

03:22.920 --> 03:24.520
I'm sorry.

03:26.160 --> 03:27.480
SHE SIGHS

03:29.040 --> 03:30.720
It's OK.

03:32.920 --> 03:34.520
I'm asking a lot, I know I am.

03:36.320 --> 03:37.400
It's just...

03:39.080 --> 03:40.160
..something I need.

03:41.320 --> 03:43.160

Then I have a lecture.

04:29.160 --> 04:31.039
On what?

04:31.040 --> 04:33.640
Galbraithian challenges
in today's workforce.

04:35.480 --> 04:37.480
Lucky you.
Yeah.

04:38.480 --> 04:42.640
Faced with that or a morning
in bed with you, it's a no-brainer.

04:44.360 --> 04:45.440
Oh!

04:49.760 --> 04:51.679
Can you give this to Wesley?

04:51.680 --> 04:53.800
He left it when he came over
the other night.

Hi, it's... it's Carly.
Yeah, I've been in an accident.

Oh, no, no, I'm fine. I...
I just don't know when I'll be in...

OK.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.319
Pupils fixed and dilated.
Come on. Over, over, over.

07:27.320 --> 07:30.199
There's no pulse.
Right, take over. Compressions.

07:30.200 --> 07:32.359
Right, round to head,
stabilisation, please.

07:32.360 --> 07:36.399
What? Is he...?
Gary, call stabilisation, please.

07:36.400 --> 07:38.279
Excuse me, madam?

07:38.280 --> 07:40.919
If you wanna head out of the road,
go to the pavement.

07:40.920 --> 07:42.359
I'm PC Dan Paxton.

07:42.360 --> 07:44.719
Because you've been involved
in a road traffic collision,

07:44.720 --> 07:46.399
I need to take a breath specimen.

07:46.400 --> 07:48.799
So if you could blow
into this mouth piece here.

07:48.800 --> 07:49.920
Give me a nice big blow.

07:52.400 --> 07:54.840
BREATHALYSER BEEPS
That's great, perfect, thank you.

07:59.760 --> 08:02.999
I'm afraid to tell you
you've failed the test.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.239
Carly Chase, I'm arresting you
on suspicion of driving

08:05.240 --> 08:06.880
while under the influence
of alcohol.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.599
You were up early.

08:23.600 --> 08:26.879
Yeah, Ari had an eight o'clock, so
I said I'd run the kids to school.

08:26.880 --> 08:30.440
OK, well, that sounds promising.
Yeah, I hope so.

08:31.880 --> 08:34.519
Superintendent Grace
at a humble hit-and-run.

08:34.520 --> 08:36.279
What is the world coming to?

08:36.280 --> 08:38.999
Yeah, witnesses are talking about

08:39.000 --> 08:40.999
a blue pick-up truck
fleeing the scene...

08:41.000 --> 08:43.160
I'll hear it from DC Nicholl,
thank you. Ah.

08:44.960 --> 08:47.119
I'm over here
when you're ready to talk.

08:47.120 --> 08:48.439
Is it the familiar tone

08:48.440 --> 08:51.479
or the absolute refusal
to take a hint?

08:51.480 --> 08:52.880
Winning blend of the two?

08:54.880 --> 08:57.039
Nick, I understand
it might be deliberate?

08:57.040 --> 08:58.320
Yeah, possibly.

08:59.320 --> 09:01.279
Victim is an Anthony Robinson,

09:01.280 --> 09:04.280
according to a Beacon University
ID card found in his bag.

09:06.840 --> 09:09.119
What about this blue pick-up?

09:09.120 --> 09:11.959
So, it's knocked our cyclist
into the path of a lorry

09:11.960 --> 09:13.600
and then drove off at speed.

09:15.320 --> 09:16.999
Where does the grey Golf fit in?

09:17.000 --> 09:22.840
TBC, but the driver, Carly Chase,
just failed a breath test.

09:23.840 --> 09:27.399
We need to trace this pick-up
as a priority.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.199
I want all CCTV pulled

09:29.200 --> 09:32.319
from local businesses and shops
before it's wiped, OK?

09:32.320 --> 09:33.359
Yes, boss.

09:33.360 --> 09:36.959
Is that from the pick-up?
Serial number should tell us.

09:36.960 --> 09:40.359
But it's only attached
with a bit of glue and wire.

09:40.360 --> 09:41.680
Could help us trace the pick-up.

09:43.600 --> 09:44.760
Norman, Bella.

09:46.040 --> 09:48.560
Found something else
inside the deceased's backpack.

09:50.160 --> 09:52.079
Right, I'm guessing
they're not paracetamol.

09:52.080 --> 09:55.439
Probably not, but if this
is foul play, that could be motive.

09:55.440 --> 09:56.599
Bleak House.

09:56.600 --> 09:58.919
I might've finished it
if I had that version.

09:58.920 --> 10:00.600
DRIVER:
They just came out of nowhere!

10:01.880 --> 10:04.999
Lorry driver?
Yeah, er, Roger Ferguson.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.559
He's passed a breath test.

10:06.560 --> 10:08.760
He just didn't have time
to brake or dodge the cyclist.

10:09.720 --> 10:11.159
Go and see if he's OK.

10:11.160 --> 10:13.719
Erm, maybe get him to run through
what happened again,

10:13.720 --> 10:14.920
if he's up to it.

10:39.040 --> 10:41.519
'Uncanny.'
'What?'

10:41.520 --> 10:43.039
'Spinella.'

10:43.040 --> 10:45.719
He practically beat us to it today.

10:45.720 --> 10:50.479
Yeah. Just like Bishop's house.
And Sophie Carrington's, remember?

10:50.480 --> 10:52.639
He was there
before the cordon went up.

10:52.640 --> 10:55.959
How's he doing it?
Has he got an inside man? A mole?

10:55.960 --> 10:58.439
You are giving him
way too much credit.

10:58.440 --> 11:00.160
Then how?

11:08.640 --> 11:10.000
KNOCK ON DOOR

11:14.120 --> 11:16.639
I appreciate that talking
to two complete strangers

11:16.640 --> 11:19.280
is probably the last thing
you wanna be doing right now.

11:21.520 --> 11:25.199
So... we can wait,
or if you have a mate

11:25.200 --> 11:28.840
you would like to call
that could come over, that's OK.

11:30.040 --> 11:35.640
Me and Tony, we just sort of lived
in each other's pockets, so...

11:36.760 --> 11:39.320
..I think I've driven
all my mates away.

11:40.560 --> 11:42.840
Do you mind telling me
how you and Tony met?

11:44.640 --> 11:48.119
We met in New York,
in Washington Square.

11:48.120 --> 11:50.000
Where they play chess?
Yeah.

11:51.440 --> 11:53.000
Yeah, where they play chess.

11:54.360 --> 11:55.400
Erm...

11:56.720 --> 11:59.559
I was on my summer holiday
after my first year,

11:59.560 --> 12:02.880
and Tony had just done
his first year at Harvard.

12:03.880 --> 12:06.759
So he dropped out to come here?
Yeah.

12:06.760 --> 12:10.679
His parents went nuts, but...
that was Tony.

12:10.680 --> 12:13.679
Once he made his mind up... Sorry.

12:13.680 --> 12:14.919
No, please, look,

12:14.920 --> 12:17.120
I'm sorry that we have to ask you
these questions.

12:20.720 --> 12:21.839
Laura?

12:21.840 --> 12:26.639
At some point, we're going to need
somebody to identify Tony's body.

12:26.640 --> 12:30.760
If you're not up to it, that's OK.

12:32.440 --> 12:34.720
I think Tony's parents should do it.

12:37.800 --> 12:39.720
We found something
in Tony's backpack...

12:40.960 --> 12:42.640
..that we need to talk to you about.

12:46.920 --> 12:48.880
Was Tony dealing?

12:50.400 --> 12:54.280
Bit of ecstasy around campus?
Low-level stuff, maybe?

12:56.320 --> 12:59.159
Are you...
You're sure that's Tony's?

12:59.160 --> 13:01.279
You said that there were
other vehicles involved.

13:01.280 --> 13:03.679
Pretty sure. It was in his backpack.

13:03.680 --> 13:06.079
In intent-to-supply quantities.

13:06.080 --> 13:08.759
So you're gonna make it
all about that now?

13:08.760 --> 13:09.959
No, we're not.

13:09.960 --> 13:11.799
The only reason
I'd be interested in the drugs

13:11.800 --> 13:14.079
is if they had a bearing
on Tony's death.

13:14.080 --> 13:15.160
Well, how could they?

13:17.520 --> 13:20.279
The pick-up truck that flipped Tony

13:20.280 --> 13:22.760
under the wheels of the artic
fled the scene.

13:24.520 --> 13:26.799
So right now, we can't rule out
the possibility

13:26.800 --> 13:30.080
that this was murder,
not an accident.

13:37.240 --> 13:39.240
OK. Thanks, Nick.

13:43.520 --> 13:49.319
So, you uttered the grand total
of 12 words in there?

13:49.320 --> 13:50.720
Ari?

13:52.080 --> 13:57.399
At this point, all I can think is,
what is the problem?

13:57.400 --> 13:59.519
You know, what's the hitch?

13:59.520 --> 14:02.039
So ask her.
I did.

14:02.040 --> 14:04.280
She says she doesn't know.

14:05.480 --> 14:07.679
Just something that she needs.

14:07.680 --> 14:10.080
Maybe she's just fallen out of love.

14:11.920 --> 14:14.360
You two are gonna work through this,
I know you are.

14:23.160 --> 14:24.640
So, what did you make of Laura?

14:26.000 --> 14:27.279
She's, er...

14:27.280 --> 14:30.520
'Well, she's devastated, obviously.'

14:31.880 --> 14:33.120
'I think she's scared.'

14:36.640 --> 14:40.519
TONY: 'Hey.
Thought we didn't have secrets.

14:40.520 --> 14:42.520
'Especially one Wesley's in on
and I'm not.

14:44.280 --> 14:45.400
'Call me back.'

15:01.040 --> 15:02.400
DOOR OPENS

15:04.120 --> 15:07.319
Is my solicitor here yet?
No, not yet.

15:07.320 --> 15:08.520
Sit down, please.

15:09.880 --> 15:11.999
Carly Chase,
I'm re-arresting you on suspicion

15:12.000 --> 15:14.880
of causing death while driving
under the influence of alcohol.

15:16.800 --> 15:18.559
He's...
I'm afraid so.

15:18.560 --> 15:19.919
SHE EXHALES

15:19.920 --> 15:21.680
I crashed to avoid him.

15:23.160 --> 15:25.400
The cyclist. I mean, he...

15:27.440 --> 15:29.479
He was on the wrong side
of the road.

15:29.480 --> 15:31.320
You'd best save that
for your interview.

15:34.360 --> 15:36.119
James.

15:36.120 --> 15:37.440
Carly.

15:40.520 --> 15:43.279
Let's see if we can
sort this mess out, shall we?

15:43.280 --> 15:46.239
The inquiry into the hit-and-run
death of Tony Robinson

15:46.240 --> 15:49.359
has been named Operation Violin.

15:49.360 --> 15:53.919
Glenn will be serving as
Deputy Senior Investigating Officer.

15:53.920 --> 15:56.279
Nick, could you run us through

15:56.280 --> 15:58.799
the highlights
of the witness statements, please?

15:58.800 --> 16:01.639
OK, so, seems like
Tony turned into the street

16:01.640 --> 16:03.159
on the wrong side of the road,

16:03.160 --> 16:06.359
causing the silver Golf
to swerve into the taxi office.

16:06.360 --> 16:08.439
Tony was then hit
by the blue pick-up,

16:08.440 --> 16:10.159
which had just run through
a red light.

16:10.160 --> 16:13.639
He was then flipped across the road,
right under the wheels of the artic.

16:13.640 --> 16:17.039
So, what about the driver
of the grey Golf?

16:17.040 --> 16:21.199
Carly Chase. In custody,
having failed a second breath test.

16:21.200 --> 16:22.799
So the driver of the pick-up

16:22.800 --> 16:25.119
probably fled the scene
for obvious reasons -

16:25.120 --> 16:30.479
stolen vehicle, no insurance,
worried about being breathalysed,

16:30.480 --> 16:32.559
could've been carrying something
incriminating.

16:32.560 --> 16:36.319
Probably, but not certainly?
Yeah, well...

16:36.320 --> 16:38.159
Glenn.

16:38.160 --> 16:42.119
Yeah. There's a detail of, as yet,
unknown significance

16:42.120 --> 16:43.359
that we need to factor in.

16:43.360 --> 16:46.039
Tony was carrying
intent-to-supply quantities

16:46.040 --> 16:47.479
of what we now know to be ecstasy.

16:47.480 --> 16:51.079
So if he was dealing,
even just on student campus,

16:51.080 --> 16:53.919
and pissed someone off,
that could be motive.

16:53.920 --> 16:57.279
So until we know different,
we're treating this as murder.

16:57.280 --> 16:59.959
Nick, can you head down to the uni,
find out if he was dealing?

16:59.960 --> 17:01.519
And if so, to who?

17:01.520 --> 17:03.719
Yeah, and anything on his supplier
would be good, too.

17:03.720 --> 17:05.759
And I've been on the phone
to the NYPD.

17:05.760 --> 17:08.719
They've informed his parents,
Pat and Fernanda Robinson,

17:08.720 --> 17:10.599
of their son's death.

17:10.600 --> 17:12.199
What do we know about them,
the parents?

17:12.200 --> 17:15.119
Just that Pat Robinson
is a Wall Street accountant.

17:15.120 --> 17:17.800
Runs one of the city's biggest firms
on the Upper East Side.

17:19.000 --> 17:22.599
OK. And what about the driver
of the artic?

17:22.600 --> 17:24.519
Erm... Ferguson?

17:24.520 --> 17:26.519
It wasn't just the crash
eating him -

17:26.520 --> 17:28.759
he's in bother on his driver hours.

17:28.760 --> 17:30.879
He was over?
Well over.

17:30.880 --> 17:33.159
Says his refrigeration unit
was on the blink,

17:33.160 --> 17:35.799
and he was carrying
perishable seafood.

17:35.800 --> 17:37.599
OK. But there's no indication
that fatigue

17:37.600 --> 17:39.519
might've influenced his actions,
then?

17:39.520 --> 17:43.000
Witnesses agree he didn't have time
to brake, and CCTV supports that.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.399
Then he's not our primary lead.

17:46.400 --> 17:50.519
Our priority is to find the driver
of that pick-up

17:50.520 --> 17:53.879
because at the very least,
he's facing a manslaughter charge.

17:53.880 --> 17:57.480
Guys, we've just got our first
screen grab of the blue pick-up.

18:05.160 --> 18:06.360
Who are you?

18:08.080 --> 18:10.239
Nadiuska has completed
the postmortem

18:10.240 --> 18:14.559
on a previously healthy
21-year-old American national,

18:14.560 --> 18:17.000
provisionally identified
as Tony Robinson.

18:19.160 --> 18:22.919
We found some blue paint transfer
on the right shoulder of his jacket,

18:22.920 --> 18:25.359
probably where
the pick-up struck him.

18:25.360 --> 18:29.079
That transfer is consistent with
an abrasion to the right shoulder.

18:29.080 --> 18:31.559
I found evidence
of severe and widespread trauma

18:31.560 --> 18:34.159
consistent with
multiple internal injuries.

18:34.160 --> 18:35.839
And that was cause of death?

18:35.840 --> 18:37.399
I'm confident it was, yeah.

18:37.400 --> 18:40.199
I've sent off blood and other
fluid samples for drug testing.

18:40.200 --> 18:42.000
There's something else
you should see.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.159
Is that what I think it is?
A bullet wound.

18:52.160 --> 18:53.799
Long healed.

18:53.800 --> 18:57.919
Discoloration suggests it was
sustained ten years ago minimum.

18:57.920 --> 19:00.040
He was lucky he wasn't paralysed.

19:01.560 --> 19:03.560
Well, his luck ran out.

19:10.120 --> 19:13.640
Are you sure you wanna get rid?
You could get a grand, at least.

19:14.760 --> 19:16.120
OK.

19:23.480 --> 19:25.200
PHONE VIBRATES

19:40.800 --> 19:43.120
# Happy birthday to you... #

19:58.160 --> 20:00.080
PHONE VIBRATES

20:01.400 --> 20:02.799
Norman?

20:02.800 --> 20:05.999
Right, the prints off the wing
mirror belong to a Jason Charles.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.639
'The driver of the pick-up?'
No, Charles is Black.

20:08.640 --> 20:10.399
But his convictions for car crime

20:10.400 --> 20:12.599
and his recent release
from Eastville prison

20:12.600 --> 20:14.319
point to him knowing the driver.

20:14.320 --> 20:16.319
'Good work. Check it out.'

20:16.320 --> 20:19.879
Yeah, his parole sheet also says
he's working at a Charles Mechanics?

20:19.880 --> 20:21.560
I reckon he fitted that mirror.

20:30.800 --> 20:32.520
Malcolm Charles?

20:34.800 --> 20:37.080
Yeah.
East Sussex CID.

20:38.520 --> 20:40.999
We're looking for Jason Charles?

20:41.000 --> 20:43.079
What's he supposed to have done now?

20:43.080 --> 20:45.680
Well, that's between us and him,
isn't it?

20:49.400 --> 20:51.320
Jason...
Oi!

20:52.480 --> 20:53.840
Brats.

20:58.160 --> 21:01.400
Jason! Don't be daft!

21:08.040 --> 21:09.400
Let's go back inside.

21:12.920 --> 21:14.160
Oi, Malcom.

21:15.920 --> 21:17.919
You didn't get him, then?
No, we didn't get him.

21:17.920 --> 21:19.239
You want a drink of water?

21:19.240 --> 21:21.880
You want to get done
for obstruction? OK, OK.

21:26.400 --> 21:28.519
Help us out, Malcolm.

21:28.520 --> 21:31.600
It's in your interest and Jason's.

21:32.880 --> 21:36.039
I told him I don't want him
doing any work,

21:36.040 --> 21:39.200
paid or unpaid, on his mates' cars.
But...?

21:40.280 --> 21:43.160
It was Monday or Tuesday.

21:44.720 --> 21:47.600
He said he'd lock up
cos he had to finish a job.

21:49.320 --> 21:51.280
Oi. That work?

22:00.000 --> 22:01.640
That's the pick-up truck.

22:04.360 --> 22:07.360
OK, you take a good look around
for me...

22:10.840 --> 22:12.120
Ewan Preece.

22:16.400 --> 22:19.559
'Preece is a 31-year-old dealer
serving the last three weeks

22:19.560 --> 22:22.119
'of a six-year sentence
for drug offences.'

22:22.120 --> 22:25.559
So... he's on day release,
presumably?

22:25.560 --> 22:27.159
'From Eastville Prison.'

22:27.160 --> 22:30.479
Now, he was supposed to be
on a construction site in Arundel

22:30.480 --> 22:32.999
this morning, learning
the finer points of bricklaying,

22:33.000 --> 22:35.279
but he didn't show.

22:35.280 --> 22:38.639
Due back for lock-in, then,
presumably?

22:38.640 --> 22:40.839
'Yeah, in half an hour.'

22:40.840 --> 22:41.919
Call the prison.

22:41.920 --> 22:43.879
If he's even a minute late,
I wanna hear about it.

22:43.880 --> 22:45.559
'Yeah. Look, boss...'

22:45.560 --> 22:49.799
Probably best to mention
that I know Preece of old.

22:49.800 --> 22:52.239
I nicked him for joyriding
a while back,

22:52.240 --> 22:54.359
tried to get him
on the straight and narrow.

22:54.360 --> 22:57.319
'Ended up making a bit of a prat
of myself in the process.

22:57.320 --> 23:00.559
'Hard to believe, I know.'
Very hard to believe, Norman (!)

23:00.560 --> 23:03.159
'But I got him a job
at my uncle's lumber yard.

23:03.160 --> 23:05.039
'Two days in,
he's got his hand in the till

23:05.040 --> 23:06.519
'and a power drill down his pants.'

23:06.520 --> 23:08.999
Sounds like he's graduated
to more serious stuff.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.239
'Yeah.'

23:10.240 --> 23:12.399
Boss, Preece was no angel.

23:12.400 --> 23:15.359
'But killing a teenager?
I can't see him sinking that low.'

23:15.360 --> 23:19.399
People change, Norman.
Usually not for the better.

23:19.400 --> 23:21.079
There's a cheerful thought (!)

23:21.080 --> 23:22.679
Plus, he's been in Eastville.

23:22.680 --> 23:25.480
Who knows what kind of mentors
he met in there?

23:32.080 --> 23:34.280
We suspect Tony was dealing.

23:36.280 --> 23:38.999
And the man
who knocked him off his bike

23:39.000 --> 23:41.079
has form in that department.

23:41.080 --> 23:43.439
His name is Ewan Preece.

23:43.440 --> 23:46.319
Have you seen him before, Laura?

23:46.320 --> 23:48.039
Is it a name you might recognise?

23:48.040 --> 23:50.400
Somebody Tony
might've talked about, maybe?

23:54.440 --> 23:56.680
Look, if you're holding back
because you're scared...

23:57.960 --> 24:00.039
..I understand, I really do.

24:00.040 --> 24:04.959
But if you want justice for Tony,
we need to know what you know.

24:04.960 --> 24:08.039
As in... everything.

24:08.040 --> 24:09.479
SHE SNIFFS
I just...

24:09.480 --> 24:11.440
I don't know
what you want me to say.

24:12.440 --> 24:14.959
Look, we've spoken to Tony's tutor.

24:14.960 --> 24:18.200
She was very surprised to hear
that he was involved in dealing.

24:21.120 --> 24:23.480
Are you sure
you don't recognise him, Laura?

24:24.880 --> 24:27.120
Yeah. I'm sure.

24:30.120 --> 24:31.639
This is my card.

24:31.640 --> 24:35.359
Call me anytime
if you want to talk...

24:35.360 --> 24:37.400
or if you feel scared.

24:38.440 --> 24:40.079
Anything, OK?

24:40.080 --> 24:42.080
Thank you.

24:48.680 --> 24:51.799
DOOR OPENS,
CLOSES

24:51.800 --> 24:53.199
'Laid it on a bit thick in there.'

24:53.200 --> 24:55.759
Think so?
Yeah, I mean...

24:55.760 --> 24:57.200
maybe she doesn't know anything.

24:58.960 --> 25:01.319
Glenn, if you think
she doesn't know anything,

25:01.320 --> 25:04.280
then maybe you shouldn't be sitting
your inspector's exam.

25:05.320 --> 25:06.719
Nice (!)

25:06.720 --> 25:09.999
Well, go on, then, genius.
What do you think she's hiding?

25:10.000 --> 25:11.160
I don't know.

25:12.160 --> 25:14.679
Copper's nose.
I've just got a feeling.

25:14.680 --> 25:17.479
Ah, so now you've got a feeling.

25:17.480 --> 25:19.799
There is something we're not seeing.

25:19.800 --> 25:21.480
PHONE VIBRATES

25:23.040 --> 25:24.279
Norman?

25:24.280 --> 25:27.480
'Boss, Ewan Preece -
he didn't make it back for lock-in.'

25:31.640 --> 25:34.440
What's for dinner?
Shepherd's pie.

25:35.560 --> 25:37.240
One of your favourites, isn't it?

25:38.600 --> 25:39.999
Oh, can you remind me

25:40.000 --> 25:43.319
to book a taxi to take you
to school tomorrow morning?

25:43.320 --> 25:44.640
Ethan?

25:45.960 --> 25:47.999
Book a taxi
to take me to school tomorrow.

25:48.000 --> 25:49.599
Oh, ha-ha (!)

25:49.600 --> 25:51.959
I could walk.

25:51.960 --> 25:55.119
You'll never get up in time.
I could bike.

25:55.120 --> 25:57.439
Lucas and Charlie bike,
and they live further away.

25:57.440 --> 26:00.600
No. No way.
You are not biking to school.

26:02.560 --> 26:03.880
Look...

26:05.400 --> 26:06.440
..I've had a shit day.

26:07.800 --> 26:10.799
OK?
Not as shit as that cyclist.

26:10.800 --> 26:13.199
Ethan! What...?

26:13.200 --> 26:14.480
Forget it.

26:22.720 --> 26:25.079
Norman,
anything on Preece's location?

26:25.080 --> 26:28.119
Yeah, his last known address
before he got sent down

26:28.120 --> 26:30.879
is under surveillance -
house he shared with his sister.

26:30.880 --> 26:33.559
Good. Glenn, can you head
down there, supervise? Yeah, sure.

26:33.560 --> 26:35.599
Now, I had a chat with the governor
from Eastville.

26:35.600 --> 26:37.599
Apparently, Preece shared a cell

26:37.600 --> 26:40.079
with a Warren Tucker
until last year.

26:40.080 --> 26:43.079
Warren Tucker, I know that name.
Heavy-duty villain.

26:43.080 --> 26:45.599
Flooded coke into Brighton
in the noughties.

26:45.600 --> 26:47.079
Doing life for double murder.

26:47.080 --> 26:49.479
So Tucker and Preece were close?

26:49.480 --> 26:50.879
As two coats of paint.

26:50.880 --> 26:55.039
Governor split 'em up,
fearing Tucker's "undue influence".

26:55.040 --> 26:57.039
What else have we got on Tucker?

26:57.040 --> 27:00.519
He's a reputation for two things -
extreme violence

27:00.520 --> 27:04.279
and schooling his younger employees
in the art of conducting business.

27:04.280 --> 27:07.279
So, how much education
did Ewan enjoy

27:07.280 --> 27:08.840
before the governor split them up?

27:10.040 --> 27:11.399
Well, maybe you're right, boss.

27:11.400 --> 27:13.039
Maybe Preece has changed

27:13.040 --> 27:15.240
and he's not the harmless moron
that I remember.

27:16.400 --> 27:20.719
We exercise extreme caution
when apprehending Preece.

27:20.720 --> 27:23.280
Please convey that to the team.
Sure.

27:29.480 --> 27:31.799
VOICEMAIL: 'Please leave
your message after the tone.'

27:31.800 --> 27:33.439
BEEP
Jason...

27:33.440 --> 27:34.840
It's me.

27:37.040 --> 27:39.680
Forget your loyalty to Preece.

27:40.960 --> 27:45.600
If you don't turn yourself in,
I'm coming over there myself.

27:46.840 --> 27:48.480
Yeah. Later.

28:15.440 --> 28:17.959
The parents are flying over
to view the body.

28:17.960 --> 28:20.679
CLEO: Yeah.
I volunteered for the welcome party.

28:20.680 --> 28:24.639
Great. Good, good.
You can calm the waters.

28:24.640 --> 28:26.679
Do you think they'll be tricky?

28:26.680 --> 28:29.639
Wealthy, Wall Street types...

28:29.640 --> 28:32.399
They're probably gonna want answers.

28:32.400 --> 28:35.999
And until we find Preece,
I'm not sure we can give them any.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.319
Speaking of which...

28:38.320 --> 28:40.919
Will you leave
that bloody thing alone?

28:40.920 --> 28:43.959
Sorry.
I'm just checking surveillance.

28:43.960 --> 28:46.799
Oh, yeah, I'm still waiting
on tox for Tony Robinson.

28:46.800 --> 28:48.039
HE SIGHS

28:48.040 --> 28:51.559
Sorry about the change of venue.
I... just want it to be...

28:51.560 --> 28:52.759
Locked and loaded?

28:52.760 --> 28:54.880
Ready.
THEY CHUCKLE

29:03.040 --> 29:05.360
Beautiful.
SHE CHUCKLES

29:06.480 --> 29:09.399
Happy anniversary.
Happy anniversary.

29:09.400 --> 29:11.160
There's no going back now.

29:12.240 --> 29:14.279
What do you mean?

29:14.280 --> 29:16.719
Work is off limits
for the rest of the night.

29:16.720 --> 29:19.800
WHISPERS: That is fine by me.
Liar!

29:22.440 --> 29:24.960
I've been thinking about
speeding things up a bit.

29:27.640 --> 29:31.919
We don't know how fast
either of us will sell our places...

29:31.920 --> 29:34.239
Well, the agents say
it's a seller's market.

29:34.240 --> 29:35.879
Oh, they always say that.

29:35.880 --> 29:38.679
And then
there's buying a new place...

29:38.680 --> 29:40.240
What are you suggesting?

29:43.480 --> 29:45.680
Move in with me for a bit.

29:46.760 --> 29:48.400
Call it a trial period.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.120
What do you think?

29:55.680 --> 29:57.120
Tomorrow?

29:58.240 --> 30:01.200
What? I'll pack a suitcase tonight,
and I'll move in tomorrow.

30:04.480 --> 30:06.439
What about Glenn?
He'll be fine.

30:06.440 --> 30:08.599
He'll have the run of the place.
He'll love it.

30:08.600 --> 30:11.359
Tomorrow? Why?

30:11.360 --> 30:14.240
Because I don't wanna make
the same mistake twice.

30:15.360 --> 30:20.519
Roy... I don't care what house,
flat, bed we're in.

30:20.520 --> 30:23.240
I just wanna see you when I wake up
in the morning. That's it.

30:25.640 --> 30:28.920
PHONE VIBRATES
Take it.

30:32.280 --> 30:33.439
Glenn.

30:33.440 --> 30:35.039
'You'd better check
the Argus website.

30:35.040 --> 30:36.840
'Spinella's outdone himself.'

31:09.600 --> 31:11.319
You just couldn't help it,
could you?

31:11.320 --> 31:14.079
Thought you were supposed
to be with Cleo?

31:14.080 --> 31:15.520
I was.

31:16.600 --> 31:18.239
I'm not trying to undermine you,
Glenn.

31:18.240 --> 31:19.920
I'm just checking in, that's all.

31:21.720 --> 31:22.839
Everything all right?

31:22.840 --> 31:25.039
Yeah.

31:25.040 --> 31:27.080
It's just this Spinella thing.

31:29.120 --> 31:31.239
How did he get to the mechanics'

31:31.240 --> 31:33.759
while Norman and Bella
were still there?

31:33.760 --> 31:36.039
GLENN SIGHS
Dunno.

31:36.040 --> 31:39.039
Bring him in? Sweat him?

31:39.040 --> 31:40.679
With what?

31:40.680 --> 31:43.160
He'll just say it was
his keen journalistic instincts.

31:45.000 --> 31:48.279
RADIO: 'All units,
all units from OP-six, be aware.'

31:48.280 --> 31:49.919
We have an incoming on foot,

31:49.920 --> 31:53.720
Marion Gardens
towards Maythorpe Road.

31:56.160 --> 31:58.280
Cap's a match for the one
he was wearing at the garage.

31:59.640 --> 32:04.159
OK, incoming is believed to be
the suspect, but... no positive ID.

32:04.160 --> 32:06.320
'Now heading for the target house.'

32:09.680 --> 32:11.720
Come on, what's the plan, boss?

32:14.320 --> 32:17.000
Look, do we take him now,
or do we wait till he's inside?

32:18.520 --> 32:20.560
Take him. Repeat, take him.

32:22.080 --> 32:24.079
Armed police! Show me your hands!
Police!

32:24.080 --> 32:25.399
Hands! Hands!

32:25.400 --> 32:27.439
Hands! Down, down!

32:27.440 --> 32:29.039
Get your hands on the floor, Preece!

32:29.040 --> 32:32.400
Put your hands down on the floor!
Preece! You're under arrest.

32:36.080 --> 32:37.879
He put you up to this, didn't he?

32:37.880 --> 32:40.559
To flush us out,
see if we were watching you? What?

32:40.560 --> 32:44.280
I'm just walking home.
Wearing your brother's clothes?

32:47.640 --> 32:50.440
What's going on?
Evie.

32:52.080 --> 32:53.799
Norman.

32:53.800 --> 32:56.639
Where is he, Evie? Where's Ewan?

32:56.640 --> 32:59.799
Just save us all a lot of bother
and tell us.

32:59.800 --> 33:01.240
I don't know.

33:02.360 --> 33:03.520
I don't!

33:04.800 --> 33:06.199
Get her out of here.

33:06.200 --> 33:09.760
Well, if this is Preece
trying to flush us out...

33:11.720 --> 33:13.520
..he's picked the right spot.

33:15.680 --> 33:18.679
Local police called
to a scene in Kemptown.

33:18.680 --> 33:20.960
It's Malcolm Charles.

33:22.600 --> 33:27.799
Gunshot wounds to the right arm...
and to the head.

33:27.800 --> 33:29.199
Powder burn on the skin.

33:29.200 --> 33:31.359
Up close and personal.

33:31.360 --> 33:33.359
Professional, certainly.

33:33.360 --> 33:35.479
They clearly knew
what they were doing.

33:35.480 --> 33:38.880
Poor sod.
I feel bad at shouting at him now.

33:39.880 --> 33:41.759
Ballistics?

33:41.760 --> 33:45.959
Entry wound above the ear,
slightly lower exit wound,

33:45.960 --> 33:48.680
giving us a downward trajectory.

33:50.680 --> 33:52.599
No bullet inside.

33:52.600 --> 33:55.840
Looks like he dug it out
and took it with him.

33:57.160 --> 33:58.519
Very professional.

33:58.520 --> 34:01.880
Which fits with the chest wounds.
Neat, precise...

34:03.080 --> 34:05.120
Is that salt?
Yes.

34:06.720 --> 34:08.160
Looks like he was tortured.

34:09.240 --> 34:11.239
There's two reasons
you torture someone -

34:11.240 --> 34:13.999
you're a sadist,
or you want information.

34:14.000 --> 34:17.399
I know they're not
mutually exclusive, but...

34:17.400 --> 34:19.439
what are we looking at,
if you had to pick?

34:19.440 --> 34:21.919
The latter one, I'd say.

34:21.920 --> 34:23.759
Given the neat, incremental wounds,

34:23.760 --> 34:26.799
plus he took the trouble
to bring the salt to the scene.

34:26.800 --> 34:29.759
Why would someone
torture Malcolm Charles?

34:29.760 --> 34:33.799
No record,
no history of criminality.

34:33.800 --> 34:36.079
Unlike his nephew, Jason.

34:36.080 --> 34:38.039
Preece hears about Jason
doing a runner,

34:38.040 --> 34:40.120
decides to get to him before us.

34:41.400 --> 34:44.039
Malcolm refuses to give him up,
so...

34:44.040 --> 34:46.919
Well, why?
Why would Preece go after Jason?

34:46.920 --> 34:48.839
Shut him up.

34:48.840 --> 34:51.719
About what?
Location, plans...

34:51.720 --> 34:55.519
things they might have divulged
when they were inside.

34:55.520 --> 34:57.719
But if he did send Tony
under the truck,

34:57.720 --> 34:59.199
why isn't he lying low?

34:59.200 --> 35:01.039
I don't know.

35:01.040 --> 35:02.559
But right now, he's the only person

35:02.560 --> 35:05.439
linking Malcolm Charles
to Tony Robinson.

35:05.440 --> 35:07.999
And if you're right...

35:08.000 --> 35:10.879
we need to find Jason
before Preece does.

35:10.880 --> 35:14.240
Come on, Norman, you've nicked him.
Where do we start?

35:16.360 --> 35:18.320
Well, Warren Tucker, I suppose.

35:47.520 --> 35:48.880
Ethan?

35:53.920 --> 35:56.199
I don't wanna make another one.

35:56.200 --> 35:58.639
Another...?
Memory box.

35:58.640 --> 36:00.239
What if you get into another crash?

36:00.240 --> 36:02.000
What if you're not so lucky
next time?

36:04.400 --> 36:07.239
I've got bad news for you, mate.

36:07.240 --> 36:09.479
I'm not going anywhere.

36:09.480 --> 36:12.000
You will never get rid of me.

36:18.160 --> 36:20.319
Now, just do me a favour, yeah?

36:20.320 --> 36:23.239
Keep your tracking app on
when you go out, OK?

36:23.240 --> 36:24.560
Sure, Mum.

36:57.960 --> 36:59.440
Would you like to follow me?

37:07.720 --> 37:10.360
Mr and Mrs Robinson.

37:12.520 --> 37:14.560
Cleo Morey.
Good afternoon.

37:18.240 --> 37:19.559
I'm so sorry for your loss.

37:19.560 --> 37:21.560
And having to travel so far
to be here.

37:22.560 --> 37:26.399
I think you're both very brave.
Thank you.

37:26.400 --> 37:27.560
This way.

37:36.920 --> 37:39.279
Can I offer you a tea or a coffee?

37:39.280 --> 37:41.039
No, thank you.

37:41.040 --> 37:44.239
Thank you again
for making the journey here.

37:44.240 --> 37:47.599
DS Moy and I are here to offer
as much illumination as we can

37:47.600 --> 37:49.759
or try and answer
any questions you might have

37:49.760 --> 37:52.200
about the circumstances
of Tony's tragic death.

37:54.400 --> 37:58.480
I'm afraid your son suffered
serious abrasions in the accident.

37:59.800 --> 38:02.920
I would recommend you look at Tony
through the viewing window.

38:06.200 --> 38:08.160
I want to see him.

38:09.440 --> 38:10.640
To hold him.

38:12.160 --> 38:13.360
Hug him.

38:15.840 --> 38:17.480
He's cold in there.

38:22.200 --> 38:23.600
Yes, of course.

38:25.480 --> 38:27.320
But please be prepared.

38:50.680 --> 38:52.200
SHE SOBS

39:01.400 --> 39:03.520
It's OK, I'm here now.

39:06.400 --> 39:08.040
I'm here.

39:10.840 --> 39:12.480
I'm here.

39:22.400 --> 39:24.440
Tell us about the accident.

39:26.240 --> 39:29.479
There were three vehicles involved.

39:29.480 --> 39:31.960
Witness reports indicate...
We know that.

39:33.080 --> 39:35.799
What we wanna hear is your progress.

39:35.800 --> 39:38.120
Any news on the pick-up driver?

39:39.360 --> 39:40.879
What about the trucker?

39:40.880 --> 39:43.719
The driver of the pick-up
has not yet been found.

39:43.720 --> 39:47.319
But our efforts are ongoing.

39:47.320 --> 39:49.399
We will find him.

39:49.400 --> 39:51.160
I... I'm sorry....

39:52.360 --> 39:56.079
I'm just...
trying to make sense of it all.

39:56.080 --> 39:57.120
Of course.

39:58.280 --> 40:00.999
And as soon as we have
any more information,

40:01.000 --> 40:02.360
we'll let you know.

40:04.840 --> 40:06.280
Thank you.

40:08.360 --> 40:10.039
I'm sorry.

40:10.040 --> 40:13.200
There's a designated area outside
if you'd like to smoke.

40:15.720 --> 40:17.080
Sure thing.

41:09.520 --> 41:12.679
Ethan!
You've got dentist on Thursday.

41:12.680 --> 41:14.080
DOG BARKS DISTANTLY

41:50.720 --> 41:52.960
Oh, get a grip, Carly.

42:34.920 --> 42:37.319
MAN: 'Mr Jones
to the governor's office.

42:37.320 --> 42:39.599
'Mr Jones to the governor's office.'
DOOR BUZZES

42:39.600 --> 42:41.599
HE GRUNTS

42:41.600 --> 42:43.880
PANTS HEAVILY

42:46.960 --> 42:48.480
Evening, Warren.

42:52.000 --> 42:55.240
DS Norman Potting.
WARREN GRUNTS

42:57.720 --> 43:00.479
It's about Ewan.
You're well acquainted, aren't you?

43:00.480 --> 43:01.759
WARREN SIGHS

43:01.760 --> 43:04.119
Look, he didn't make it back
for lock-in.

43:04.120 --> 43:06.399
He might be in some bother.
WARREN SIGHS

43:06.400 --> 43:09.079
'Mr Sebden, can you make your way
to viewing, please?'

43:09.080 --> 43:11.079
You know, me and you
have got something in common.

43:11.080 --> 43:13.319
WARREN SCOFFS
Yeah.

43:13.320 --> 43:16.840
You know, we both tried to help him.
Steer him.

43:18.960 --> 43:20.679
More fool us, eh?

43:20.680 --> 43:23.079
UNDER HIS BREATH: Yeah.

43:23.080 --> 43:27.040
How about...
we give him another chance?

43:31.040 --> 43:32.960
D'you know what sunk costs are?

43:35.040 --> 43:37.879
An investment
that's already been made...

43:37.880 --> 43:40.079
and can't be recovered.

43:40.080 --> 43:41.439
When I was in business,

43:41.440 --> 43:44.359
I knew loads of people
just didn't get that.

43:44.360 --> 43:47.079
They're thinking
if they've lost a million,

43:47.080 --> 43:49.200
well, they might as well blow
two or three.

43:50.800 --> 43:52.479
Hang in there. See it through.

43:52.480 --> 43:53.999
But not you?
Nah, not me.

43:54.000 --> 43:55.959
I got a buzz
out of cutting my losses.

43:55.960 --> 43:57.959
Walking away and never looking back.

43:57.960 --> 44:01.440
No matter how much I put in,
how much I lost.

44:03.040 --> 44:04.480
The more, the merrier.

44:08.760 --> 44:10.480
Do you understand?

44:12.160 --> 44:15.799
Ewan Preece... is a sunk cost?

44:15.800 --> 44:18.519
First day of his parole,
he got shitfaced in the Bull

44:18.520 --> 44:21.399
when he should've been on site
in Arundel.

44:21.400 --> 44:23.959
He smashed his mirror
in a pub car park

44:23.960 --> 44:27.679
and got it fixed, hoping
that I wouldn't hear about it.

44:27.680 --> 44:28.839
I mean...
HE SCOFFS

44:28.840 --> 44:32.240
Vain hope?
It was the deception I didn't like.

44:33.280 --> 44:35.080
You're very well informed, Warren.

44:36.920 --> 44:38.480
Preece is beyond help.

44:39.560 --> 44:41.719
Right, so you don't believe
in second chances?

44:41.720 --> 44:43.919
That was his second chance.

44:43.920 --> 44:46.280
DOOR OPENS,
CLOSES

44:52.280 --> 44:55.279
ROY: How d'you feel
about your brother getting out?

44:55.280 --> 44:57.199
I feel... great about it.

44:57.200 --> 44:59.959
You're close?
Yeah.

44:59.960 --> 45:01.560
Not as close as you were, though?

45:03.000 --> 45:04.719
Six years apart'll do that.

45:04.720 --> 45:08.359
What about Warren Tucker?
Did he come between you?

45:08.360 --> 45:10.319
Looked after Ewan. He was a mate.

45:10.320 --> 45:11.840
Got him to do some A-levels.

45:12.880 --> 45:14.280
Right.

45:19.600 --> 45:21.080
Malcolm Charles.

45:24.080 --> 45:27.720
SHE SCOFFS
If you're saying Ewan did this...

45:29.120 --> 45:30.439
It's just... There's no way.

45:30.440 --> 45:32.879
Right, then help us find him.
Eliminate him.

45:32.880 --> 45:34.719
I don't know where he is, I swear.

45:34.720 --> 45:36.959
You seemed frightened, Evie.

45:36.960 --> 45:39.199
I've waited a long time
for him to get out.

45:39.200 --> 45:42.439
Is it fair to say that prison
has changed Ewan?

45:42.440 --> 45:46.159
How much of that is down to
Tucker's influence, do you think?

45:46.160 --> 45:48.719
Tucker's son was a junkie,
killed himself.

45:48.720 --> 45:52.199
He saw Ewan as,
I dunno, a surrogate?

45:52.200 --> 45:54.360
Second chance?

45:55.680 --> 45:58.319
Ewan was working
at a construction firm

45:58.320 --> 45:59.960
as part of his day release.

46:01.160 --> 46:04.959
He pranged their pick-up truck
on his first day, but he was...

46:04.960 --> 46:08.759
more scared of Tucker's reaction
than the governor's.

46:08.760 --> 46:10.759
Why was he scared?
Mm...

46:10.760 --> 46:14.519
Had a few at lunchtime with a mate,
and the truck was company-use only.

46:14.520 --> 46:16.359
Enough to nix his day release?

46:16.360 --> 46:20.919
So he got Jason to fix the mirror,
no questions asked.

46:20.920 --> 46:22.199
That's it.

46:22.200 --> 46:24.160
No, that's not "it", Evie.

46:25.160 --> 46:27.919
He put Tony Robinson
under the wheels of a truck.

46:27.920 --> 46:29.200
We just don't know why.

46:30.800 --> 46:32.199
SHE WHIMPERS

46:32.200 --> 46:34.280
When did you last see him?

46:35.280 --> 46:37.079
OK, yeah.

46:37.080 --> 46:39.920
He let himself in this afternoon.
I was at work.

46:40.960 --> 46:43.159
And you didn't see him?

46:43.160 --> 46:47.439
No. I... did in the park.

46:47.440 --> 46:49.519
He gave me his clothes to wear.

46:49.520 --> 46:52.879
S-Said he needed to know
if it was safe

46:52.880 --> 46:54.919
to stay a night at mine
before he got out.

46:54.920 --> 46:58.399
So not only
did he callously use you,

46:58.400 --> 47:02.159
he asked you to lie to us,
albeit by omission.

47:02.160 --> 47:04.679
That is a serious offence, Evie.

47:04.680 --> 47:07.839
How could you believe
a word he says? Hmm?

47:07.840 --> 47:12.359
About the pick-up truck?
About what he has or hasn't done?

47:12.360 --> 47:14.800
About anything, really?

47:16.920 --> 47:19.479
Don't know.
SHE INHALES SHARPLY

47:19.480 --> 47:22.119
Did he say where he was going?

47:22.120 --> 47:23.640
He wouldn't tell me.

47:24.880 --> 47:27.959
Said it was...
SHE SNIFFLES

47:27.960 --> 47:29.800
..better if I didn't know.

47:41.600 --> 47:43.520
GATE OPENS

47:48.640 --> 47:49.920
SOFTLY: Shit.

47:54.120 --> 47:55.640
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT

48:00.240 --> 48:02.039
I was passing by.

48:02.040 --> 48:04.960
SHE SIGHS
C'mon, Glenn.

48:07.800 --> 48:09.719
Sorry about this morning.

48:09.720 --> 48:11.800
No. No, look, I'm sorry.

48:13.600 --> 48:15.480
For loitering with intent...

48:17.320 --> 48:18.680
..and for putting you on the spot.

48:20.200 --> 48:23.960
I mean, they're fair questions.
More than fair.

48:26.000 --> 48:29.279
I'm sorry my answers
have been so vague.

48:29.280 --> 48:33.560
All I can tell you is that...
I'm not trying to make a point...

48:34.800 --> 48:36.440
..or hurt you or anything.

48:38.600 --> 48:40.320
I just need to get my head straight.

48:44.640 --> 48:47.200
OK. I got it.

49:18.400 --> 49:19.920
DOOR OPENS

49:21.520 --> 49:23.480
DOOR CLOSES

49:30.320 --> 49:34.679
So, as soon as the press
get a sniff of Malcolm Charles,

49:34.680 --> 49:36.600
we're gonna have a panic
on our hands.

49:37.840 --> 49:39.400
We need to be ready.

49:40.800 --> 49:43.280
Well, that's a relief.

49:48.720 --> 49:50.360
I'm moving in with Cleo...

49:53.000 --> 49:54.080
..tomorrow.

49:55.280 --> 49:56.440
Wow.

49:57.640 --> 50:00.640
Congratulations.
Thanks.

50:07.440 --> 50:10.160
Just, er... Just one thing.

50:11.400 --> 50:12.920
Am I out on my ear?

50:15.360 --> 50:18.800
Not as long as you
continue feeding Marlon.

50:23.640 --> 50:24.840
Are you gonna be all right?

50:26.160 --> 50:27.599
Seriously?

50:27.600 --> 50:30.599
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, of course I am.

50:30.600 --> 50:35.039
Don't need to worry about me, OK?
Old timer.

50:35.040 --> 50:36.360
GLENN CHUCKLES

50:50.480 --> 50:52.400
KNOCKING

51:11.480 --> 51:13.240
DRIVER: Argh!

51:20.720 --> 51:23.080
PANICKED BREATHING

51:39.360 --> 51:42.599
Thank you for calling.
Yes, I'm outside the front now.

51:42.600 --> 51:43.760
I'll see you in a minute.

51:45.000 --> 51:47.719
DSI Grace! How goes it?

51:47.720 --> 51:49.400
Any leads on Ewan Preece?

51:52.160 --> 51:53.719
How'd you know about Preece?

51:53.720 --> 51:56.800
Well... put two and two together.

51:57.920 --> 51:59.239
"Two and two"?
Hm.

51:59.240 --> 52:01.679
Care to elucidate?

52:01.680 --> 52:03.159
Sure.

52:03.160 --> 52:06.399
Your lot made a big noise outside
his sister's place yesterday,

52:06.400 --> 52:08.959
and my man in Eastville says
that Ewan skipped lock-up.

52:08.960 --> 52:11.999
Ergo, he's your hit-and-run driver.

52:12.000 --> 52:13.519
But did he kill Malcolm Charles?

52:13.520 --> 52:16.159
What were you doing
outside that mechanics'?

52:16.160 --> 52:18.519
Answering a question with a question
is very Messianic.

52:18.520 --> 52:22.039
And before you say "coincidence"
or "anonymous source"

52:22.040 --> 52:27.159
or some other bullshit, know this -
your piece got Malcolm killed,

52:27.160 --> 52:29.959
and now Jason has gone underground,

52:29.960 --> 52:32.719
and our best chance
of finding Preece has gone with him.

52:32.720 --> 52:34.679
What were you doing
outside the mechanics'?

52:34.680 --> 52:37.720
My job - following a lead.
You should try it.

52:39.000 --> 52:42.239
Ooh, careful.
You might do something you regret.

52:42.240 --> 52:43.640
Hit me, for example.

52:44.640 --> 52:46.360
That's a bad example.

52:49.400 --> 52:52.119
OK. Look, my man at Eastville says

52:52.120 --> 52:53.879
that Ewan and Jason
were cell-mates.

52:53.880 --> 52:56.319
The mechanics' is down
on Jason's parole sheet

52:56.320 --> 52:57.919
as his place of work.

52:57.920 --> 52:59.440
Happy?

53:00.600 --> 53:03.640
We hadn't identified Preece
as a suspect then.

53:05.000 --> 53:08.479
So unless you had
and weren't sharing,

53:08.480 --> 53:13.040
which is obstruction, in my book,
no, I'm not happy.

53:15.120 --> 53:17.160
I know you're getting help, Kevin.

53:18.920 --> 53:20.959
I just don't know how.

53:20.960 --> 53:22.600
Who.

53:25.000 --> 53:26.599
Sorry, you've lost me.

53:26.600 --> 53:29.159
Oh, come on.
All these scoops, exclusives.

53:29.160 --> 53:33.399
It's not because you're the
Carl Bernstein of Brighton, is it?

53:33.400 --> 53:35.679
I don't know who that is.
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT

53:35.680 --> 53:37.039
That figures.

53:37.040 --> 53:40.799
Well, thanks, Superintendent.
It's always a pleasure (!)

53:40.800 --> 53:42.759
If you so much
as mention Preece's name -

53:42.760 --> 53:44.959
in print, online, wherever -

53:44.960 --> 53:46.680
it will be the last thing
you ever do.

54:17.200 --> 54:19.839
JAMES: 'The time and date
of your court hearing has been set.

54:19.840 --> 54:22.119
'It's next Tuesday at 11am.'

54:22.120 --> 54:24.199
Right. Of course.
KNOCK ON DOOR

54:24.200 --> 54:26.159
RECEPTIONIST:
Carly, your ten o'clock's here.

54:26.160 --> 54:28.599
'My guess is you'll lose
your driver's licence for a year.'

54:28.600 --> 54:29.839
A year?!

54:29.840 --> 54:33.079
'Yes. Hopefully not longer.'

54:33.080 --> 54:35.839
Well, how am I supposed to take
Ethan to school or get to work?

54:35.840 --> 54:39.319
KNOCK ON DOOR
Just give me a minute, please?

54:39.320 --> 54:42.480
'Everything OK?'
Yeah. Sorry.

54:43.560 --> 54:45.439
'Ready for the address
for the magistrates'?'

54:45.440 --> 54:46.680
Er...

54:49.240 --> 54:51.640
Yep, ready.

54:53.360 --> 54:56.399
Whatever it takes,
we have to find Ewan Preece today.

54:56.400 --> 54:58.279
Where did he go
when he left his sister's?

54:58.280 --> 54:59.519
Where'd he stash the pick-up?

54:59.520 --> 55:01.519
We know he was in touch
with Jason from Eastville.

55:01.520 --> 55:03.079
We do, but Jason's AWOL -
not a sniff.

55:03.080 --> 55:06.119
OK, so who else? Check his
cell-mates, but don't stop there.

55:06.120 --> 55:08.159
Who else was he close to
apart from Warren Tucker?

55:08.160 --> 55:09.919
Who were his regular visitors?

55:09.920 --> 55:12.239
Yeah, I paid Warren Tucker
a visit last night.

55:12.240 --> 55:13.599
He's not gonna help.

55:13.600 --> 55:15.119
Why not? His boy's in trouble?

55:15.120 --> 55:18.599
He says Ewan is a "sunk cost".
Claims he's written him off.

55:18.600 --> 55:20.199
Wow that's cold.

55:20.200 --> 55:22.799
Yeah, IF we buy it.
I'm not sure you do.

55:22.800 --> 55:24.039
OK, well, regardless of that,

55:24.040 --> 55:25.839
they were kept apart
before Ewan's release,

55:25.840 --> 55:28.959
so he had to make new pals
on the cell block - who were they?

55:28.960 --> 55:31.239
Let's not forget his mates
before he went down.

55:31.240 --> 55:33.839
He's got a long record.
I doubt he was offending on his own.

55:33.840 --> 55:36.359
He wasn't. No, I know these boys
he used to knock about with.

55:36.360 --> 55:39.639
I mean, "boys" - men now.

55:39.640 --> 55:41.519
Well, let's pay them a visit.
And his family.

55:41.520 --> 55:44.039
Oh, he hasn't got any family,
has he? Just the sister.

55:44.040 --> 55:46.799
Oh, and by the way, we need to keep
looking over our shoulders.

55:46.800 --> 55:47.879
Spinella?

55:47.880 --> 55:50.399
I caught him today in the company
of Tony Robinson's father.

55:50.400 --> 55:52.799
Ah, we can expect
some headlines, then?

55:52.800 --> 55:55.279
"Victim's parents say police
are dragging their feet".

55:55.280 --> 55:57.319
I think he's planning
more than that.

55:57.320 --> 55:58.679
You give him too much credit.

55:58.680 --> 56:01.239
That's exactly what I said.
Yes, you did.

56:01.240 --> 56:04.679
and then he turned up
outside Jason Charles's front door.

56:04.680 --> 56:06.760
We must not underestimate Spinella.

56:48.120 --> 56:50.840
HE GASPS

56:56.960 --> 57:00.439
Roger Ferguson - the lorry driver
who ran Tony over.

57:00.440 --> 57:02.239
And that's Jason -

57:02.240 --> 57:05.879
last seen outrunning Norman and I
on Kemptown Road.

57:05.880 --> 57:08.839
Well, we got him in the end, eh?

57:08.840 --> 57:11.199
Feels like a million years ago.

57:11.200 --> 57:13.239
Preece is still the common thread.

57:13.240 --> 57:17.039
He knew Jason from Eastville
and got him to fix his wing mirror.

57:17.040 --> 57:19.319
We're still missing a why.

57:19.320 --> 57:24.279
Even if Preece targeted Tony
over some drug deal...

57:24.280 --> 57:25.839
why kill Ferguson?

57:25.840 --> 57:28.239
Also, why stick around in Brighton?

57:28.240 --> 57:31.999
Why put the bodies on display,
put them where they'll be found,

57:32.000 --> 57:34.359
when you're wanted
for a hit-and-run?

57:34.360 --> 57:35.720
Something's off.

57:49.880 --> 57:52.560
Three murders. Three victims.

57:53.720 --> 57:56.080
All of whom
we can link to your brother.

57:58.280 --> 58:00.359
Where is he, Evie?

58:00.360 --> 58:03.280
I just don't believe you when
you say you haven't got an inkling.

58:06.520 --> 58:08.600
Hasn't been easy between you two,
has it?

58:10.600 --> 58:13.799
We checked Ewan's visitation log
at Eastville.

58:13.800 --> 58:15.599
You were a weekly fixture
for five years,

58:15.600 --> 58:19.240
but since Christmas...
not one visit.

58:25.280 --> 58:26.800
Had a falling-out.

58:31.120 --> 58:35.639
I was so looking forward
to him coming home, moving back in.

58:35.640 --> 58:38.120
We were in foster care together,
and...

58:40.480 --> 58:42.120
..suddenly, he had other plans.

58:44.760 --> 58:45.960
OK.

58:49.000 --> 58:50.640
Tucker sorted him a place.

58:52.480 --> 58:54.440
Ewan said it was near the harbour.

58:56.000 --> 58:57.080
That's all I know.

58:58.080 --> 59:00.160
OK, we're gonna pause it there
for a few minutes.

59:01.160 --> 59:02.320
Excuse us, Evie.

59:05.120 --> 59:06.280
DOOR OPENS

59:07.520 --> 59:08.720
'So, the harbour...'

59:09.720 --> 59:10.999
Check Tucker's assets,

59:11.000 --> 59:13.359
any recent purchases
by close family members.

59:13.360 --> 59:16.519
Also, a targeted ANPR
around the harbour

59:16.520 --> 59:18.359
for Preece's pick-up truck.

59:18.360 --> 59:20.920
We're close, Glenn. We're close.

59:31.600 --> 59:32.760
Roy?

59:33.880 --> 59:35.799
Cameras caught a blue pick-up
on Harbour Road

59:35.800 --> 59:37.800
bearing various hallmarks
of Preece's truck.

59:40.280 --> 59:42.479
Where did he end up?
We don't know.

59:42.480 --> 59:45.839
Footage shows the pick-up entering
the harbour via the east entrance.

59:45.840 --> 59:48.999
And after that, nothing -
trail goes cold.

59:49.000 --> 59:52.039
Get on to the harbour.
Foursquare search?

59:52.040 --> 59:55.280
And whenever the next sonar sweep
is due, bring it forward.

1:00:19.000 --> 1:00:20.360
BELLA: It's Preece's pick-up.

1:00:25.560 --> 1:00:27.000
Yeah, that's Ewan.

1:00:28.560 --> 1:00:29.600
It's Ewan Preece.

1:00:46.480 --> 1:00:48.879
CLEO: Doesn't look like
he made much effort to get away.

1:00:48.880 --> 1:00:50.040
Suicide?

1:00:52.240 --> 1:00:55.120
SHE SIGHS
Dead man's grip.

1:00:56.200 --> 1:00:57.520
Rigor mortis?

1:00:59.000 --> 1:01:01.879
Well, the suddenness
of immersion brings it on fast...

1:01:01.880 --> 1:01:05.559
But not so fast
he couldn't let go of the wheel.

1:01:05.560 --> 1:01:07.880
SHE SIGHS
What is it?

1:01:10.720 --> 1:01:13.440
His hands have been glued
to the wheel.

1:01:14.720 --> 1:01:16.240
Christ!

1:01:17.520 --> 1:01:20.599
They say that drowning's
one of the worst ways to go.

1:01:20.600 --> 1:01:23.519
So he was tortured, basically.

1:01:23.520 --> 1:01:26.479
Malcolm Charles mark two.

1:01:26.480 --> 1:01:29.439
Not quite. You asked me
if I thought Malcolm was tortured

1:01:29.440 --> 1:01:32.599
for information or pure sadism.

1:01:32.600 --> 1:01:34.679
I said the former.

1:01:34.680 --> 1:01:36.560
But this looks like the latter?

1:01:37.720 --> 1:01:41.279
The level of theatricality,
the preparation required,

1:01:41.280 --> 1:01:44.559
the risks involved...
feels personal.

1:01:44.560 --> 1:01:46.479
OK, so what're we looking at?

1:01:46.480 --> 1:01:49.999
A cold-blooded killer
devolving into a psycho?

1:01:50.000 --> 1:01:52.280
Or the change
speaks to the victimology.

1:01:54.440 --> 1:01:58.479
From their injuries, I'd say Malcolm
and Jason aren't primary victims -

1:01:58.480 --> 1:02:01.079
they were just a means to an end
to find Preece.

1:02:01.080 --> 1:02:03.199
OK, so if not Preece, then who?

1:02:03.200 --> 1:02:06.359
Who killed four people
without leaving a witness

1:02:06.360 --> 1:02:08.719
or a single forensic trace?

1:02:08.720 --> 1:02:10.159
Tucker?

1:02:10.160 --> 1:02:12.359
We can't rule him out,
but we have to step back now.

1:02:12.360 --> 1:02:13.919
Right back.

1:02:13.920 --> 1:02:17.519
OK, in the light of Preece's death
it seems unlikely

1:02:17.520 --> 1:02:19.959
that he meant to send Tony
under the wheels of the truck,

1:02:19.960 --> 1:02:21.719
so we have an accidental death

1:02:21.720 --> 1:02:25.359
that seems to have been a catalyst
for four murders.

1:02:25.360 --> 1:02:27.679
We can't be sure about that.

1:02:27.680 --> 1:02:30.839
No, but if all four murders
link back to Tony,

1:02:30.840 --> 1:02:33.559
we have to ask ourselves why?

1:02:33.560 --> 1:02:35.200
What is it about him?

1:02:51.880 --> 1:02:54.359
Your investigation has been slow,

1:02:54.360 --> 1:02:58.199
reactive and achieved
the square root of sod all -

1:02:58.200 --> 1:03:01.600
something thrown into sharp relief
by the death of your prime suspect.

1:03:02.680 --> 1:03:05.479
Turns out Preece is a victim -

1:03:05.480 --> 1:03:07.679
indeed the victim
who's been made to suffer the most.

1:03:07.680 --> 1:03:09.959
It would seem so, yes, sir.

1:03:09.960 --> 1:03:13.560
You've wasted a day, and now
there's this to contend with.

1:03:16.200 --> 1:03:17.799
Read the terms and conditions.

1:03:17.800 --> 1:03:20.919
"£100,000 for information

1:03:20.920 --> 1:03:23.119
"leading to the identity
of the suspect."

1:03:23.120 --> 1:03:25.479
Talk about paraffin on the flames.

1:03:25.480 --> 1:03:27.159
This is Spinella all over.

1:03:27.160 --> 1:03:30.159
Not that you're obsessed with him
at all (!)

1:03:30.160 --> 1:03:32.959
He has someone
in East Sussex Police.

1:03:32.960 --> 1:03:37.359
Every crime scene, he's there
straight after us, sometimes...

1:03:37.360 --> 1:03:38.999
Enough!

1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:40.559
Stop fixating on Spinella,

1:03:40.560 --> 1:03:43.359
and I suggest
you find a new, viable suspect

1:03:43.360 --> 1:03:46.239
so we can reassure people that
we have a clue what we're doing.

1:03:46.240 --> 1:03:47.440
Yes, sir.

1:03:49.720 --> 1:03:52.760
This is a very challenging
and fast-moving case.

1:03:53.920 --> 1:03:55.839
If this was the Met,
you and I both know

1:03:55.840 --> 1:03:57.719
that we would have 50 bodies
on this.

1:03:57.720 --> 1:04:01.719
As it is, my team worked until dawn
and were back in at 8am

1:04:01.720 --> 1:04:03.759
for a briefing,
and they will do the same tonight

1:04:03.760 --> 1:04:06.879
and tomorrow night
and for however long it takes

1:04:06.880 --> 1:04:09.319
until we catch this man.

1:04:09.320 --> 1:04:11.199
What's your point?

1:04:11.200 --> 1:04:15.160
Your loyalty... is appreciated.

1:04:18.920 --> 1:04:21.439
The National Crime Agency
just called

1:04:21.440 --> 1:04:24.080
to offer their help and expertise.

1:04:25.080 --> 1:04:29.320
I thanked them sincerely and
told them we had the job in hand.

1:04:30.360 --> 1:04:33.040
How's that for loyalty?

1:04:39.480 --> 1:04:41.119
All right?

1:04:41.120 --> 1:04:47.359
So, CCTV caught a man
leaving the harbour on foot at 2am.

1:04:47.360 --> 1:04:49.279
Run him up the flagpole,

1:04:49.280 --> 1:04:52.759
then trawl all known associates
of Warren Tucker.

1:04:52.760 --> 1:04:54.359
Yeah, I'm on it.

1:04:54.360 --> 1:04:57.519
Oh, and Hampshire
spent quite a lot of money

1:04:57.520 --> 1:05:00.839
on facial recognition software
only last year.

1:05:00.840 --> 1:05:04.479
Ah, well, sharing's caring -
I'll give 'em a call.

1:05:04.480 --> 1:05:06.920
What would I do without you, Norman?
NORMAN CHUCKLES

1:05:25.360 --> 1:05:27.080
SIGHS

1:05:50.200 --> 1:05:52.199
Don't forget to get me early
for the dentist.

1:05:52.200 --> 1:05:55.839
I'm sending a taxi from Alpha Weald.
I've told the school.

1:05:55.840 --> 1:05:57.200
Can it be George?

1:05:58.280 --> 1:05:59.799
Can it be George from Alpha Weald?

1:05:59.800 --> 1:06:03.199
Ah, well, I'll ask, but no promises.

1:06:03.200 --> 1:06:05.200
Why can't you take me?

1:06:06.640 --> 1:06:08.759
I've... got to go and do something.

1:06:08.760 --> 1:06:10.719
What?

1:06:10.720 --> 1:06:12.199
SIGHS

1:06:12.200 --> 1:06:14.919
I'm going to see the parents
of the American boy.

1:06:14.920 --> 1:06:17.599
What are you going to say to them?

1:06:17.600 --> 1:06:19.920
That I'm sorry.
But it wasn't your fault.

1:06:21.000 --> 1:06:24.959
Why don't you tell them about Dad?
I might.

1:06:24.960 --> 1:06:27.639
You could give them something.
I don't think that's appropriate.

1:06:27.640 --> 1:06:30.000
To show them that you mean it!
Anybody can say sorry.

1:06:32.120 --> 1:06:33.240
Hm.

1:06:44.400 --> 1:06:45.999
Good steer
on the facial mapping, boss.

1:06:46.000 --> 1:06:47.759
Hampshire came through for us.

1:06:47.760 --> 1:06:50.199
We ran the face of the bloke
exiting the harbour.

1:06:50.200 --> 1:06:52.879
CCTV at Gatwick picked this up.

1:06:52.880 --> 1:06:55.079
American national - John Nash?

1:06:55.080 --> 1:06:56.999
Arrived from Paris three days ago.

1:06:57.000 --> 1:06:58.759
Put out an all units -
ports and airports.

1:06:58.760 --> 1:07:00.919
We need to throw
a net over the city now.

1:07:00.920 --> 1:07:01.960
American.

1:07:03.920 --> 1:07:07.399
Bella, four hubs we know he's spent
time in -

1:07:07.400 --> 1:07:10.919
the harbour, Evie's place,
M23, and the mechanics'...

1:07:10.920 --> 1:07:11.999
And we know when.
Yeah.

1:07:12.000 --> 1:07:14.879
Cross-reference CCTV and ANPR

1:07:14.880 --> 1:07:17.880
for any cars showing up
in all of those places. I'm on it.

1:07:21.080 --> 1:07:25.959
This man is American, and obviously,
the Robinsons are American.

1:07:25.960 --> 1:07:29.480
I mean, it would be remiss of us not
to look for some kind of link, no?

1:07:30.600 --> 1:07:32.959
Well, they certainly
have means and motive.

1:07:32.960 --> 1:07:34.999
Remember Laura Cadman's reaction

1:07:35.000 --> 1:07:37.559
when we suggested that
she might have to ID Tony's body?

1:07:37.560 --> 1:07:39.999
Yeah, she was... she was worried.

1:07:40.000 --> 1:07:42.079
She was scared.

1:07:42.080 --> 1:07:44.480
And what was Pat Robinson
doing with Spinella?

1:07:49.560 --> 1:07:51.160
Listen to the wording here...

1:07:52.360 --> 1:07:55.639
"£100,000 for information

1:07:55.640 --> 1:07:58.999
"leading to the identity
of the suspect."

1:07:59.000 --> 1:08:01.479
Not "leading to the arrest
and conviction",

1:08:01.480 --> 1:08:03.080
"leading to the identity".

1:08:04.240 --> 1:08:07.679
They're straying
into vigilante territory.

1:08:07.680 --> 1:08:10.480
But to focus
on the suspect's identity, that's...

1:08:12.080 --> 1:08:15.039
..aggressive, it's revealing.

1:08:15.040 --> 1:08:17.279
Pat Robinson is...
is just an accountant.

1:08:17.280 --> 1:08:19.799
A Wall Street accountant.

1:08:19.800 --> 1:08:22.879
That kind of wealth buys you power,
influence,

1:08:22.880 --> 1:08:25.559
the expectation that you get
everything your own way.

1:08:25.560 --> 1:08:28.920
Yeah. Except we have no proof
that they are behind this.

1:08:31.160 --> 1:08:32.760
Well, let's go and find some.

1:08:40.600 --> 1:08:42.799
TONY: 'Hey.
Thought we didn't have secrets.

1:08:42.800 --> 1:08:44.959
'Especially one Wesley's in on
and I'm not.'

1:08:44.960 --> 1:08:47.280
The last thing he said to me.
To anyone.

1:08:51.120 --> 1:08:52.400
They were my drugs.

1:08:54.120 --> 1:08:56.799
Why did you lie?
I didn't wanna get in trouble.

1:08:56.800 --> 1:08:59.359
Trouble? A few pills? First offence?

1:08:59.360 --> 1:09:02.280
What's that, community service?
Suspended sentence?

1:09:05.600 --> 1:09:09.199
You let us believe
that those pills belonged to him,

1:09:09.200 --> 1:09:13.159
and because of that, you risked
derailing our entire investigation.

1:09:13.160 --> 1:09:14.919
Why did you do that?

1:09:14.920 --> 1:09:18.159
Was that the same reason you
didn't wanna identify Tony's body?

1:09:18.160 --> 1:09:21.200
What is it about his parents, Laura?
Why are you so scared of them?

1:09:22.480 --> 1:09:23.520
So...

1:09:25.600 --> 1:09:29.359
..Tony's mother,
her real name is Giordino.

1:09:29.360 --> 1:09:31.599
Her father is Sal Giordino -

1:09:31.600 --> 1:09:34.680
head of the most powerful
crime family on the East Coast.

1:09:37.400 --> 1:09:41.199
Does that have anything to do
with the bullet wound, the scar?

1:09:41.200 --> 1:09:42.319
Yeah. He was ten.

1:09:42.320 --> 1:09:45.239
He got shot while he was riding
in a car with his grandfather.

1:09:45.240 --> 1:09:47.200
Right, so the bullet
was for him? Sal?

1:09:48.680 --> 1:09:51.999
The murders on the news, I mean,
that's because of Tony, isn't it?

1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:54.999
Well, given what you've
just told us, I think so, yeah.

1:09:55.000 --> 1:09:57.199
It's revenge.
What about the reward they put up?

1:09:57.200 --> 1:09:59.759
That was a diversion. A smokescreen.

1:09:59.760 --> 1:10:02.320
Yeah, and it almost worked.

1:10:13.760 --> 1:10:15.759
BELLA: 'We've got a navy Astra
caught on camera

1:10:15.760 --> 1:10:18.399
'near two of the hubs -
mechanics' and the harbour.'

1:10:18.400 --> 1:10:19.679
'Did you run the plates?'

1:10:19.680 --> 1:10:22.199
'The Astra was hired three days ago
at Gatwick Airport.'

1:10:22.200 --> 1:10:23.399
Course it was.

1:10:23.400 --> 1:10:25.519
'He used a credit card
but in a different name.'

1:10:25.520 --> 1:10:27.879
Listen, we think Fernanda's
put out multiple hits.

1:10:27.880 --> 1:10:30.759
Everyone connected with Tony's death
has been tortured and killed.

1:10:30.760 --> 1:10:32.600
No, not everyone. Carly Chase.

1:10:40.120 --> 1:10:43.119
Hi, hello. I'm Carly Chase?

1:10:43.120 --> 1:10:45.840

I'm not going to pretend

1:11:10.160 --> 1:11:12.959
that I understand
what you must be going through.

1:11:12.960 --> 1:11:16.160
But we do have something in common.
We do?

1:11:34.120 --> 1:11:35.440
What is this junk?

1:11:37.120 --> 1:11:38.800
My son's memory box.

1:11:40.360 --> 1:11:45.799
His father, Kes, passed away
in a skiing accident last year.

1:11:45.800 --> 1:11:50.039
And that's what you think we have
in common? We both lost someone?

1:11:50.040 --> 1:11:51.799
I'm sorry!

1:11:51.800 --> 1:11:56.960
I am so... so sorry about Tony.

1:12:01.080 --> 1:12:03.759
Found that on the beach in Corsica.

1:12:03.760 --> 1:12:06.159
Ethan was five.

1:12:06.160 --> 1:12:08.040
Don't milk it, sweetheart.

1:12:10.680 --> 1:12:12.960
He wanted you to have something
from his box.

1:12:14.840 --> 1:12:17.240
Your son did?
Yeah.

1:12:19.240 --> 1:12:20.840
That's sweet of him.

1:12:33.120 --> 1:12:34.679
Corsica?

1:12:34.680 --> 1:12:36.920
Corsica.

1:12:49.320 --> 1:12:51.880
Thank you.
Thank you.

1:12:56.000 --> 1:12:57.480
We'll walk out with you.

1:13:06.280 --> 1:13:09.040
Detective Superintendent Roy Grace.

1:13:10.120 --> 1:13:13.159
Fernanda Giordino?
What's going on?

1:13:13.160 --> 1:13:15.159
Right, come with me, please.

1:13:15.160 --> 1:13:17.319
I'm not going to waste your time
or mine.

1:13:17.320 --> 1:13:20.479
I'm just gonna make
a heartfelt plea. Call him off.

1:13:20.480 --> 1:13:23.039
I don't know what you're...
Call him off.

1:13:23.040 --> 1:13:25.599
Before anybody else gets hurt.
Am I under arrest?

1:13:25.600 --> 1:13:27.719
We have no grounds to arrest you.

1:13:27.720 --> 1:13:29.679
Then I'd like
to go about my business.

1:13:29.680 --> 1:13:31.439
Make the call, Fernanda.

1:13:31.440 --> 1:13:35.719
Listen, buddy...
we're grieving parents.

1:13:35.720 --> 1:13:39.119
If your implication
is that my wife's family somehow...

1:13:39.120 --> 1:13:40.959
Of course that's his implication.

1:13:40.960 --> 1:13:44.079
Oh, you're Sal Giordino's daughter,
all right.

1:13:44.080 --> 1:13:46.679
He liked a little theatricality,
didn't he?

1:13:46.680 --> 1:13:48.839
And a lot of pain.

1:13:48.840 --> 1:13:53.279
I wish you luck...
with your investigation, Detective.

1:13:53.280 --> 1:13:56.639
Killing, torture,
it's not going to bring Tony back.

1:13:56.640 --> 1:13:58.279
It won't make you feel better.

1:13:58.280 --> 1:14:00.079
How the hell do you know?

1:14:00.080 --> 1:14:02.319
I know what you've done.

1:14:02.320 --> 1:14:04.799
And it will catch up with you
in the end, I promise.

1:14:04.800 --> 1:14:08.639
You're only as strong
as your weakest link, Fernanda.

1:14:08.640 --> 1:14:12.159
And I will find that link
between you and Nash,

1:14:12.160 --> 1:14:14.520
and you will die in prison.

1:14:24.200 --> 1:14:26.799
He says they're Mafia.
Is that true?

1:14:26.800 --> 1:14:29.679
What did you talk about, Carly?
What did you tell 'em?

1:14:29.680 --> 1:14:33.160
We talked about losing someone.
We talked about Ethan.

1:14:35.920 --> 1:14:38.239
Your son? Where's your son now?
At school?

1:14:38.240 --> 1:14:42.039
Yes, but a taxi is about to take him
to the dentist.

1:14:42.040 --> 1:14:43.639
OK, call the school.

1:14:43.640 --> 1:14:46.039
We need to get you and Ethan
somewhere safe right now.

RECEPTIONIST: Hello, can I help?

1:15:05.840 --> 1:15:08.239
Er, yeah, I'm Mike from Alpha Weald,

1:15:08.240 --> 1:15:10.560
collecting Ethan Chase
for his dental appointment?

1:15:11.880 --> 1:15:14.359
It's usually, er,
George that gets him,

1:15:14.360 --> 1:15:17.399
but, er, I think he's on
an airport job or something.

1:15:17.400 --> 1:15:21.479
OK. I do have a note
of Ethan's dental appointment.

1:15:21.480 --> 1:15:23.199
Preston Dental Clinic?

1:15:23.200 --> 1:15:26.439
That's right, but I have him down
as being picked up at two.

1:15:26.440 --> 1:15:28.999
Oh, yeah, well, his, er,
mom called the office

1:15:29.000 --> 1:15:31.519
and said she, er,
wanted him collected early

1:15:31.520 --> 1:15:35.079
cos the traffic
on the seafront is awful.

1:15:35.080 --> 1:15:37.079
Tell me about it.
That's my route home.

1:15:37.080 --> 1:15:40.160
Oh, gosh. I'm sorry!
RINGING CONTINUES

1:15:41.200 --> 1:15:43.760
He's in Geography.
I'm sure he can leave early.

1:15:48.840 --> 1:15:51.159
Sorry, kid. George wasn't available.

You're right, Ethan, it's not.

1:16:26.640 --> 1:16:28.679
Not his usual place, anyways.

1:16:28.680 --> 1:16:32.399
Right. So he's working
somewhere else?

1:16:32.400 --> 1:16:34.680
Temporarily?
"Temporarily"?

1:16:36.440 --> 1:16:38.119
That's a big word for a little kid.

1:16:38.120 --> 1:16:40.679
I didn't know big words like that
at your age.

1:16:40.680 --> 1:16:42.560
What's your name?

1:16:43.640 --> 1:16:44.880
Tooth.

1:16:53.360 --> 1:16:55.760
I got no reception down here. You?

1:17:00.840 --> 1:17:02.839
Argh! Urgh!

1:17:02.840 --> 1:17:04.639
ETHAN COUGHS

1:17:04.640 --> 1:17:07.079
Right, her description
matches that of Nash.

1:17:07.080 --> 1:17:10.319
Now, Ethan had an appointment
at the dentist today.

1:17:10.320 --> 1:17:13.399
Somehow, he knew that.
Probably snuck into Carly's place.

1:17:13.400 --> 1:17:17.279
Bugged the phone, maybe?
Doesn't matter how he knew, he knew.

1:17:17.280 --> 1:17:19.600
The question is now
how do we find him?

1:17:22.200 --> 1:17:25.959
A son for a son.
We should've seen this coming.

1:17:25.960 --> 1:17:29.039
It's not your fault, boss.
Tell that to Ethan!

1:17:29.040 --> 1:17:32.199
OK, we need to plot an arc
around the school.

1:17:32.200 --> 1:17:34.959
How far could he have got
in any direction within 30 minutes?

1:17:34.960 --> 1:17:36.439
Belt and braces.
I'll do a road check

1:17:36.440 --> 1:17:37.799
on major routes up to an hour away.

1:17:37.800 --> 1:17:38.839
I want all ports alert,

1:17:38.840 --> 1:17:41.279
everyone cleaving
to the kidnap manual, no deviations.

1:17:41.280 --> 1:17:42.920
Boss.

1:17:43.920 --> 1:17:46.519
You've got to find him.
You've got to find him!

1:17:46.520 --> 1:17:50.439
Carly, listen to me.
We're going to get Ethan back.

1:17:50.440 --> 1:17:52.679
But we need your help, OK?

1:17:52.680 --> 1:17:55.919
NICK: Does Ethan have a mobile?
Yes, and he's got a tracking app.

1:17:55.920 --> 1:17:57.520
He promised me he'd keep it on.

1:18:00.480 --> 1:18:02.399
Well? Can they see him?

1:18:02.400 --> 1:18:04.520
Track him?
I'm sorry, Carly.

1:18:06.160 --> 1:18:08.799
ETHAN: Help! Help!

1:18:08.800 --> 1:18:11.560
HE BANGS ON WALL
Help! Let me out!

1:18:13.040 --> 1:18:14.599
He promised he'd keep it activated!

1:18:14.600 --> 1:18:16.879
His phone went offline
20 minutes ago.

1:18:16.880 --> 1:18:20.320
The last place we tracked it to
was a car park near the marina.

1:18:26.440 --> 1:18:27.800
TEXT ALERT

1:18:29.360 --> 1:18:32.319
What?!
What does it say, Carly?

1:18:32.320 --> 1:18:33.960
Er...

1:18:44.520 --> 1:18:46.119
PHONE RINGS

1:18:46.120 --> 1:18:48.359
'Bella,
we're just leaving the school now.'

1:18:48.360 --> 1:18:50.319
'We think Ethan's
got his dad's smartwatch.

1:18:50.320 --> 1:18:52.799
'If we're right,
he's in Shoreham Harbour.'

1:18:52.800 --> 1:18:54.439
DIAL TONE

1:18:54.440 --> 1:18:56.439
NORMAN: 'I'm heading
to the last-known location

1:18:56.440 --> 1:18:58.799
'of Ethan's phone -
looks like it's by the marina.

1:18:58.800 --> 1:19:00.959
'I don't think
we've got much time, boss.'

1:19:00.960 --> 1:19:04.280
SIREN BLARES

1:19:09.800 --> 1:19:11.280
It's been severed, and recently.

1:19:16.160 --> 1:19:20.039
I've spotted Nash on CCTV
in the marina car park.

1:19:20.040 --> 1:19:22.759
'He dropped something
getting Ethan in his car.

1:19:22.760 --> 1:19:23.799
'A tide chart.'

1:19:23.800 --> 1:19:27.039
Is there a date on the chart?
'Hang on.

1:19:27.040 --> 1:19:30.079
'This week. Mean something to you?'

1:19:30.080 --> 1:19:32.680
Not really.
'Shit.'

1:19:38.160 --> 1:19:40.640
Stop! Please! Please!

1:19:42.080 --> 1:19:45.200
It hurts, stop!
All right, just be quiet now, kid.

1:19:54.240 --> 1:19:56.439
'Interpol coughed up
what they have on Nash.

1:19:56.440 --> 1:19:59.719
'Reckon he used to go by the name
of "James John Robertson",

1:19:59.720 --> 1:20:03.599
'ex-Navy Seal turned
professional killer, AKA Tooth.'

1:20:03.600 --> 1:20:05.839
Oh, great (!)

1:20:05.840 --> 1:20:07.200
Call for back-up.

1:20:21.120 --> 1:20:23.119
Get off of me! Get off me!

1:20:23.120 --> 1:20:25.319
Argh! Get off!
Nash, don't!

1:20:25.320 --> 1:20:27.959
Argh!

1:20:27.960 --> 1:20:30.439
Police! Stop!

1:20:30.440 --> 1:20:31.999
Help! Pull me up! Pull me up!

1:20:32.000 --> 1:20:34.600
OK. Ethan, I've got you. Argh!

1:20:36.040 --> 1:20:37.400
Stop!

1:20:59.000 --> 1:21:00.919
Pull me up! Pull me up!
OK...

1:21:00.920 --> 1:21:03.120
Help!
Argh!

1:21:04.360 --> 1:21:05.400
Hold on!

1:21:18.400 --> 1:21:20.120
Ugh! Oh! Argh!

1:21:21.320 --> 1:21:22.480
Argh!

1:21:28.440 --> 1:21:30.600
GLENN CHOKES

1:21:34.400 --> 1:21:37.639
HE GASPS FOR AIR

Argh!

1:21:40.960 --> 1:21:44.599
ETHAN GRUNTS
Please! I'm slipping!

1:21:44.600 --> 1:21:45.799
I'm slipping!
Argh!

1:21:45.800 --> 1:21:47.320
ETHAN SCREAMS
Argh!

1:22:03.040 --> 1:22:04.160
Oh!

1:22:07.800 --> 1:22:10.480
HIGH-PITCHED RINGING

1:22:16.440 --> 1:22:19.359
Argh!
Please!

1:22:19.360 --> 1:22:22.520
Pull me up! Please!

1:22:24.440 --> 1:22:26.799
SHOUTING: Glenn!

Glenn!
ETHAN GRUNTS

1:22:29.240 --> 1:22:31.839
Glenn!
ETHAN STRAINS

1:22:31.840 --> 1:22:34.240
Argh!
Please!

1:22:35.360 --> 1:22:37.120
GRACE STRAINS
Glenn!

1:22:38.440 --> 1:22:39.760
Glenn!

1:22:42.080 --> 1:22:43.920
Pull me up! Pull me up!

1:22:47.920 --> 1:22:50.360
THEY STRAIN

1:22:55.120 --> 1:22:57.120
GRACE PANTS

1:22:58.640 --> 1:23:00.719
You OK? You OK?

1:23:00.720 --> 1:23:04.439
We've got him.
We need an ambulance now!

1:23:04.440 --> 1:23:07.520
THEY PANT

1:23:21.440 --> 1:23:23.919
Oh!

1:23:23.920 --> 1:23:26.080
Thank you.

1:23:27.960 --> 1:23:29.639
Brave lad.

1:23:29.640 --> 1:23:33.439
He kept his head while
I was most definitely losing mine.

1:23:33.440 --> 1:23:35.920
That's normally my job.

1:23:44.680 --> 1:23:45.960
I should've gone in.

1:23:47.680 --> 1:23:49.719
And then what?

1:23:49.720 --> 1:23:52.239
I let him get away.

1:23:52.240 --> 1:23:55.120
Speaking personally,
I'm glad you didn't go in.

1:23:56.520 --> 1:24:00.199
Hey... You saved his life.

1:24:00.200 --> 1:24:02.000
Quite probably mine, too.

1:24:04.480 --> 1:24:05.960
Can I get that in writing?

1:24:07.280 --> 1:24:11.279
Oh, what's up, boss?
Game of tug-of-war?

1:24:11.280 --> 1:24:12.559
Yeah.

1:24:12.560 --> 1:24:15.799
So, you didn't fancy
giving us a hand, then, Norman?

1:24:15.800 --> 1:24:18.839
What? What, and spoil all your fun?

1:24:18.840 --> 1:24:20.999
What?

1:24:21.000 --> 1:24:25.440
Divers are still in the water.
No sign of our man.

1:24:55.680 --> 1:24:56.719
How's Ethan?

1:24:56.720 --> 1:24:59.880
He's OK. Getting there.

1:25:04.440 --> 1:25:08.400
Is there any news?
I know he's gonna ask.

1:25:09.960 --> 1:25:13.559
Well, it seems that being dunked
into Shoreham Harbour

1:25:13.560 --> 1:25:15.759
wasn't part of Nash's plan.

1:25:15.760 --> 1:25:19.879
In his haste to get away,
he called the Robinsons' home number

1:25:19.880 --> 1:25:22.439
in New York from a payphone.

1:25:22.440 --> 1:25:24.839
How do you know?

1:25:24.840 --> 1:25:28.159
The FBI were monitoring the line
at our behest.

1:25:28.160 --> 1:25:31.679
It seems Fernanda lost her temper,
and her portion of the call

1:25:31.680 --> 1:25:36.040
is deemed - and I quote -
"compromising and actionable".

1:25:37.720 --> 1:25:39.599
I like the sound of that.

1:25:39.600 --> 1:25:41.319
So do I.

1:25:41.320 --> 1:25:44.079
An arrest is imminent.

1:25:44.080 --> 1:25:45.880
Nash, though, is a different story.

1:25:47.280 --> 1:25:52.480
We know he got as far as Paris,
and then after that... nothing.

1:25:56.360 --> 1:25:58.120
So, what have you decided, Carly?

1:26:00.600 --> 1:26:02.239
We're gonna take our chances.

1:26:02.240 --> 1:26:06.759
Install new locks, alarms, cameras.

1:26:06.760 --> 1:26:07.960
OK.

1:26:10.000 --> 1:26:12.239
Well, if you find yourself
looking over your shoulder,

1:26:12.240 --> 1:26:14.160
we can still talk about relocating.

1:26:15.320 --> 1:26:18.399
Way I see it, with her resources,

1:26:18.400 --> 1:26:21.679
if she really wanted to find us,
she could.

1:26:21.680 --> 1:26:23.359
Outer Hebrides, Timbuktu.

1:26:23.360 --> 1:26:24.959
That's probably true.

1:26:24.960 --> 1:26:29.559
And life is dangerous
wherever you are, right?

1:26:29.560 --> 1:26:30.800
Inherently?

1:26:31.960 --> 1:26:34.200
It's not without risks, certainly.

1:26:37.520 --> 1:26:40.760
So... you're staying put.

1:26:41.880 --> 1:26:44.240
Final answer?
Final answer.

1:26:45.680 --> 1:26:47.199
You know what?

1:26:47.200 --> 1:26:50.080
I won't be looking over my shoulder.

1:26:51.080 --> 1:26:52.400
Not in my nature.

1:27:18.240 --> 1:27:20.120
PHONE VIBRATES

1:27:55.200 --> 1:27:58.200
SHE BREATHES SHAKILY

1:28:11.600 --> 1:28:13.840
Annette, can you put Bruno on?

1:28:17.040 --> 1:28:18.400
Hi, Mum.

1:28:20.000 --> 1:28:21.599
I'm sorry, darling.

1:28:21.600 --> 1:28:24.639
I'm gonna be away a bit longer,
I'm afraid.

1:28:24.640 --> 1:28:26.440
'What are you doing?'

1:28:27.640 --> 1:28:29.120
I'm looking for an old friend.

1:28:31.040 --> 1:28:32.640
If I find them, I'll introduce you.

1:28:34.280 --> 1:28:35.680
How about that?

1:28:42.000 --> 1:28:44.040
