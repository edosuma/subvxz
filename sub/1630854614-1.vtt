00:32.759 --> 00:35.200
<i>The work we started on Polaris V</i>

00:35.280 --> 00:38.719
<i>could be the very thing</i>
<i>that cures our ailing planet.</i>

00:38.799 --> 00:40.439
Welcome to the loony bin!

00:40.799 --> 00:43.280
Six months of isolation
in the coldest place on Earth.

00:43.359 --> 00:44.840
<i>What could possibly go wrong?</i>

00:46.560 --> 00:48.560
Why are we not connected to the satellite?

00:48.640 --> 00:50.960
What the fuck is going on?

00:51.039 --> 00:52.600
Somebody knows how to fix it?

00:54.880 --> 00:56.560
<i>That would be Mile's job.</i>

00:59.880 --> 01:01.119
<i>Where's everybody?</i>

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
Hello?

01:05.079 --> 01:06.000
It's Magg!

01:06.560 --> 01:07.959
<i>I have seven bodies.</i>

01:08.840 --> 01:10.920
<i>I need you to tell me</i>
<i>what happened, Maggie.</i>

01:12.959 --> 01:14.359
Nils! Nils! Don't die.

01:14.439 --> 01:16.280
Nils was dead by the time I got there.

01:18.359 --> 01:19.760
<i>You can't trust her, Johan.</i>

01:21.280 --> 01:22.280
<i>She did it.</i>

01:23.799 --> 01:24.719
She killed them all.

01:27.359 --> 01:29.359
<i>We found a body</i>
<i>buried outside the station.</i>

01:29.439 --> 01:30.519
<i>It's Sarah Jackson.</i>

01:32.000 --> 01:34.640
<i>But she died in Polaris V eight years ago.</i>

01:35.840 --> 01:37.519
<i>Sarah did't die in the fire.</i>

01:39.680 --> 01:40.799
She was murdered.

01:40.879 --> 01:42.120
Good girl.

01:44.719 --> 01:46.280
<i>Arthur killed Sarah Jackson.</i>

01:46.760 --> 01:48.120
<i>And everyone else.</i>

01:48.480 --> 01:49.920
<i>Your career is over.</i>

01:52.560 --> 01:54.400
<i>Your reputation is over.</i>

01:56.000 --> 01:57.640
<i>And your life is over.</i>

02:02.719 --> 02:04.400
<i>She's not who she says she is.</i>

02:05.319 --> 02:06.239
It's done.

02:07.400 --> 02:08.639
<i>Mum would be proud of you.</i>

02:12.639 --> 02:14.240
<i>Russians have a word for it.</i>

02:16.680 --> 02:18.120
<i>"Maskirovka".</i>

02:18.599 --> 02:20.439
<i>The art of misdirection.</i>

02:22.960 --> 02:25.240
<i>What she did was so unspeakable</i>

02:25.319 --> 02:27.319
<i>that we can't stop ourselves</i>
<i>from looking at.</i>

02:32.159 --> 02:33.360
<i>And while we tried to come up</i>

02:33.439 --> 02:36.960
<i>with some reason</i>
<i>to make sense of this horror,</i>

02:41.840 --> 02:44.280
<i>we miss what this was really all about:</i>

02:47.759 --> 02:48.800
<i>it's a cover.</i>

02:53.080 --> 02:56.240
Blood is the best camouflage.

03:51.840 --> 03:52.919
Where is he?

04:16.560 --> 04:17.680
What's going on?

04:17.759 --> 04:19.199
Where is he? Where's my father?

04:19.720 --> 04:21.800
He said he wanted to feel
the power of nature.

04:42.360 --> 04:43.319
Arthur!

04:44.399 --> 04:45.399
We need you.

04:47.439 --> 04:50.319
- Are you sure?
- Yes! I checked it 15 times!

04:51.439 --> 04:52.560
Take a look.

04:54.720 --> 04:55.800
Is it stable?

04:57.000 --> 04:58.439
Solid.

04:58.519 --> 04:59.959
What's the temperature range?

05:06.279 --> 05:07.439
There's no mistake.

05:08.759 --> 05:09.879
What's going on?

05:13.680 --> 05:16.439
- We gotta check the metabolic pathways.
- Yes, we're going to check

05:16.519 --> 05:18.480
and doublecheck every bloody detail.

05:19.560 --> 05:21.000
But you can take it from me:

05:23.800 --> 05:25.000
we've found it.

05:32.040 --> 05:33.040
Got you.

05:42.560 --> 05:44.079
These past weeks at sea

05:45.079 --> 05:50.600
are the culmination of decades
of strenuous scientific research.

05:51.680 --> 05:54.920
A feat that wouldn't have been possible
without you

05:57.879 --> 06:00.000
or any of my previous collaborators.

06:00.639 --> 06:02.759
Some of whom were lost

06:02.839 --> 06:05.800
in the most atrocious
and horrifying manner.

06:06.560 --> 06:08.680
To you, to them,

06:09.800 --> 06:11.360
- to all of us!
- Cheers!

06:11.439 --> 06:13.560
Bottoms up!

06:14.759 --> 06:16.439
Enough of speeches, let's party!

06:23.439 --> 06:25.160
This is history in the making!

06:25.240 --> 06:26.759
Because the alga that we've found

06:26.839 --> 06:29.720
is enhanced by the bacteria
that Arthur discovered in Antarctica.

06:30.040 --> 06:31.920
- Enhanced? What for?
- Photosynthesis!

06:32.000 --> 06:33.959
Much more efficient than any known plant.

06:36.480 --> 06:39.319
Photosynthesis eats up
the carbon dioxide in the air

06:39.399 --> 06:41.399
and turns it into glucose and oxygen.

06:41.720 --> 06:42.959
This could stop climate change!

06:44.720 --> 06:46.160
I should hang you from the bowsprit

06:46.240 --> 06:48.399
for smuggling alcohol into my ship,
mister Kurtz.

06:48.480 --> 06:49.879
No, that was me, Captain.

06:49.959 --> 06:52.839
But you should make him walk the plank
for not bringing proper glasses!

06:53.199 --> 06:54.959
All right, fuck it, down the hatch!

06:55.839 --> 06:57.160
Cheers.

06:59.519 --> 07:00.560
I'm finished.

07:01.959 --> 07:03.959
Good night, gentlemen.
And congratulations.

07:04.040 --> 07:05.519
All right, sleep well, Captain.

07:13.439 --> 07:14.360
Excuse me.

07:20.439 --> 07:21.439
Cheers.

07:23.040 --> 07:24.120
Congratulations.

07:25.560 --> 07:26.680
I guess there's no chance

07:26.759 --> 07:29.000
you'll stop being
an unbearable egomaniac now.

07:31.199 --> 07:32.319
We did this together.

07:32.959 --> 07:35.160
No. You did this on your own.

07:35.480 --> 07:37.800
But it's fine.
I can do without you. I always have.

07:39.399 --> 07:42.720
Rachel, I was genuinely hoping
that by taking part in this...

07:42.800 --> 07:44.399
Arthur, you may talk your rich friends

07:44.480 --> 07:46.720
into funding
whatever it is you set yourself to do,

07:48.480 --> 07:50.439
but it's not going to work with me.

07:50.519 --> 07:53.079
I'm not a sample in a lab
that you can manipulate, okay?

07:58.560 --> 08:00.319
Kowalski, where are you going?

08:00.399 --> 08:02.759
- I've got work to do.
- You gotta sing for us!

08:02.839 --> 08:04.439
- Not tonight, love!
- Are you sure?

08:04.519 --> 08:05.879
- See you tomorrow.
- Okay.

08:16.199 --> 08:17.399
Yeah.

09:09.960 --> 09:11.759
That ain’t your cabin, Yuto, okay?

09:14.000 --> 09:16.440
- Are you following me or something?
- Yeah, let's celebrate.

09:16.519 --> 09:18.799
- Yeah, you go ahead.
- No, come on.

09:19.200 --> 09:22.840
- Just give me a kiss, come on.
- I said no, okay?

09:23.799 --> 09:24.799
Good night.

09:27.960 --> 09:29.279
I fold. I fold, I'm not playing.

09:29.360 --> 09:31.159
Don't pretend,
we know you have lots of money.

09:31.240 --> 09:32.600
Not that much, sailor.

09:34.120 --> 09:35.440
All in.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.039
Sorry.

09:41.840 --> 09:43.000
What do you have?

09:44.639 --> 09:46.320
- Okay.
- Where is the bottle?

09:46.399 --> 09:48.559
- Where is the bottle?
- Marcus took the drinks.

09:49.039 --> 09:50.120
He took the bottle.

09:52.080 --> 09:53.200
Marcus!

09:53.960 --> 09:55.320
Come back with the bottle!

09:57.320 --> 09:59.120
Smoking on duty again, huh?

10:00.440 --> 10:01.759
Don't you ever sleep?

10:02.679 --> 10:03.799
Do you want to try?

10:04.799 --> 10:05.879
Come on, it's good.

10:07.480 --> 10:08.519
Not tonight.

10:12.120 --> 10:13.840
Do you see that one over there?

10:14.879 --> 10:16.960
Actually, that's not really a star.

10:17.039 --> 10:19.039
That's the International Space Station.

10:19.399 --> 10:21.240
Believe it or not,
those astronauts up there

10:21.320 --> 10:23.399
are the closest human beings we’ve got.

10:28.840 --> 10:30.159
What do you want, Amy?

10:34.799 --> 10:37.120
Oh, no, no. Not again.

10:37.200 --> 10:39.200
It’s been three weeks since the last time.

10:39.279 --> 10:41.960
Amy, it's beyond the rules
and you know it.

10:42.039 --> 10:44.960
I just want to talk to them,
hear their voices.

10:45.039 --> 10:46.200
Please!

11:18.399 --> 11:20.440
Hey, what are you doing here?

11:22.440 --> 11:23.639
Hey.

11:33.679 --> 11:34.960
Blanda.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.720
Jesus Christ, Charlie!

11:38.799 --> 11:39.919
I’m sorry.

11:40.879 --> 11:42.919
I didn't mean to...

11:43.000 --> 11:44.039
It's fine.

11:48.759 --> 11:51.519
- I was looking for her.
- Are you feeding her seeds?

11:52.120 --> 11:54.679
Yes. She feels soft now.

11:55.279 --> 11:57.279
- Told you so.
- Thank you.

11:58.440 --> 11:59.600
Good night, Charlie.

12:00.440 --> 12:01.639
Good night, miss.

12:27.120 --> 12:29.360
- What took you so long?
- My father.

12:30.639 --> 12:31.919
I can't fucking stand him.

12:34.320 --> 12:36.799
And besides,
I like making you wait for me.

12:48.720 --> 12:50.440
We'll do our thing.

12:53.960 --> 12:57.039
Now we're going to go to...

13:01.399 --> 13:02.879
Yeah, yeah, we found it.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.799
Yeah, and it's even better
than we thought.

13:06.240 --> 13:08.200
<i>...Will be at the port</i>
<i>to unload the container.</i>

13:08.279 --> 13:10.039
No, no, no. No, no, I...

13:10.120 --> 13:12.480
No, I will contact you when we get back.

13:13.279 --> 13:14.360
- Okay?
<i>- Okay.</i>

13:14.840 --> 13:16.320
- Yeah?
<i>- Understood.</i>

13:17.399 --> 13:21.279
I love you too, pumpkin!
Gotta go now! Be good!

13:27.879 --> 13:28.879
Thank you.

13:59.120 --> 14:01.799
So Alec, can we head back to land now?

14:02.600 --> 14:04.559
They still need to pick up
some more samples.

14:05.480 --> 14:06.600
Three days tops.

14:07.960 --> 14:10.159
- Want some sugar?
- Sugar kills, Wan.

14:10.879 --> 14:13.000
Wan, can I have more coffee, please?

14:13.080 --> 14:14.080
Good morning.

14:14.639 --> 14:16.440
Has anyone seen Kowalski?

14:17.639 --> 14:19.279
He didn't show up
to our morning workout.

14:19.879 --> 14:20.960
And you did?

14:22.600 --> 14:24.480
I knocked on his door, he's not answering.

14:26.120 --> 14:27.039
Yeah.

14:30.240 --> 14:31.919
Don't worry, he's probably sleeping.

14:32.399 --> 14:34.559
I don't remember seen him
drinking that much.

14:34.639 --> 14:35.720
Oh, yeah.

14:38.960 --> 14:40.080
Come on, Lou.

14:41.960 --> 14:43.039
Wakey-wakey.

14:44.039 --> 14:45.080
Lazy bastard.

14:47.440 --> 14:48.559
Alright.

14:51.399 --> 14:52.519
Brace yourself.

15:01.759 --> 15:02.879
What is it?

15:17.799 --> 15:18.879
She's here.

15:46.240 --> 15:47.960
You're getting fucked, Einstein!

15:48.399 --> 15:50.000
Yeah, yeah, Mark.

15:50.080 --> 15:51.120
You should have chopped

15:51.200 --> 15:53.320
- her head off too!
- I'm sending a big kiss for you,

15:53.399 --> 15:56.399
Mark, just for you, big kiss!
Go fuck yourself!

15:56.919 --> 16:00.360
<i>After more than a year</i>
<i>of the Polaris VI massacre,</i>

16:00.440 --> 16:04.200
<i>the trial</i>
<i>against eminent biologist Arthur Wilde</i>

16:04.279 --> 16:06.840
<i>reaches its final stage.</i>

16:06.919 --> 16:08.919
<i>Doctor Wilde, who is accused</i>

16:09.000 --> 16:12.080
<i>of murdering eight members</i>
<i>of his scientific team,</i>

16:12.159 --> 16:14.480
<i>has pled innocent of all charges.</i>

16:15.080 --> 16:16.639
<i>The prosecution is counting</i>

16:16.720 --> 16:19.840
<i>on the testimony</i>
<i>of doctor Maggie Mitchell,</i>

16:19.919 --> 16:21.840
<i>the key witness to the case.</i>

16:22.759 --> 16:24.559
Please, state your full name.

16:25.279 --> 16:27.720
My name is Margaret Emilia Mitchell.

16:28.080 --> 16:30.519
You were a member of the Polaris VI crew,
weren't you?

16:30.840 --> 16:34.840
Yes. I was the doctor appointed
to be at the station for the winter.

16:34.919 --> 16:38.120
They became clear very quickly
that Arthur was the one in charge.

16:38.559 --> 16:40.919
He attacked Miles first.

16:41.000 --> 16:46.159
He was decapitated and I was asked
to examine the body and...

16:46.919 --> 16:47.919
And his head.

16:50.440 --> 16:54.679
After that, it... It got worse and worse.

16:55.320 --> 16:57.840
He jumped at Eric
and stabbed him in the neck

16:57.919 --> 16:59.879
with a piece of broken glass.

17:01.360 --> 17:02.799
And then, he went for the gun.

17:07.000 --> 17:10.720
Aki came from behind
and slammed him and they fought...

17:15.440 --> 17:16.519
Sorry.

17:19.960 --> 17:21.039
Take your time.

17:35.720 --> 17:38.839
He got hold of a screwdriver
and stabbed Aki in the stomach.

17:41.039 --> 17:45.960
He was gushing with blood,
but he stabbed him again and again.

17:46.880 --> 17:48.200
Thank you, miss Mitchell.

17:49.960 --> 17:51.799
Is that man present in this room?

17:58.480 --> 17:59.839
Could you please point at him?

18:05.119 --> 18:09.359
For the record,
tho witness has pointed at Arthur Wilde.

18:10.519 --> 18:13.680
Thank you, miss Mitchell. You may go.

18:46.880 --> 18:48.000
Syl?

18:48.079 --> 18:49.519
<i>Put on the news, quick.</i>

18:53.200 --> 18:57.279
<i>The famous biologist</i>
<i>was being taken to Portlaoise prison</i>

18:57.359 --> 18:59.039
<i>when the prison van was attacked</i>

18:59.119 --> 19:02.559
<i>in what seems</i>
<i>a perfectly executed operation</i>

19:02.640 --> 19:03.960
<i>by an organized group.</i>

19:04.400 --> 19:07.559
<i>Is it not yet clear</i>
<i>if doctor Wilde himself</i>

19:07.640 --> 19:09.759
<i>had any knowledge of his liberation</i>

19:09.839 --> 19:13.079
<i>or if he’s been taken from custody</i>
<i>against his own will.</i>

19:20.680 --> 19:21.759
Well done, lads.

19:23.039 --> 19:24.200
Doctor Wilde.

19:25.519 --> 19:28.119
- The team is waiting for you on the ship.
- All of them?

19:28.200 --> 19:29.880
Yes. And your daughter too.

19:31.720 --> 19:32.759
This way, sir.

20:06.160 --> 20:07.279
Not much blood.

20:13.920 --> 20:15.079
Is it true?

20:16.480 --> 20:18.079
They chopped his fucking head off?

20:30.400 --> 20:31.920
May God have mercy on us.

21:10.200 --> 21:11.839
Is there anything you want to tell me?

21:12.400 --> 21:14.200
- No.
- Nothing at all?

21:15.200 --> 21:16.240
Nothing at all.

21:16.559 --> 21:17.640
And last night?

21:18.759 --> 21:19.920
What happened last night?

21:21.920 --> 21:23.039
Charlie?

21:30.119 --> 21:32.880
Look at me, what the fuck happened
last night, Charlie?

21:34.279 --> 21:35.799
I didn't mean to scare anyone.

21:36.559 --> 21:38.240
What the fuck have you done, Charlie?

21:39.279 --> 21:40.880
Blanda escaped and...

21:42.559 --> 21:44.759
- Didn't see me and got scared.
- Who got scared?

21:44.839 --> 21:46.000
- Rachel!
- Rachel?

21:46.079 --> 21:48.519
- Rachel, who else? Rachel.
- And what else?

21:49.680 --> 21:52.839
And we talked about the seeds.

21:52.920 --> 21:54.200
- The seeds?
- Blanda's seeds.

21:54.960 --> 21:57.519
And then I went to work
because I have lots to do.

21:57.599 --> 21:59.000
And there's nothing else, right?

21:59.599 --> 22:01.559
Yes, I swear, I don't lie to you.

22:02.039 --> 22:03.240
- I know.
- Okay?

22:04.119 --> 22:05.319
- Hey.
- What?

22:05.400 --> 22:07.319
- You're doing really well.
- Okay.

22:08.680 --> 22:10.480
I can't believe this is happening.

22:10.559 --> 22:12.960
I should've never signed up for this job!
I fucking knew it!

22:13.039 --> 22:14.160
You didn't know shit.

22:14.720 --> 22:15.839
None of us did.

22:16.160 --> 22:18.160
They played us so bad.

22:19.119 --> 22:22.000
We never would've joined if they told us
Arthur was running the show.

22:22.079 --> 22:23.000
I would.

22:23.559 --> 22:26.400
When Arthur came on board,
that's when we should've called it off.

22:26.480 --> 22:29.480
- Well, we didn't.
- He's a wanted man!

22:29.559 --> 22:31.119
He's accused of eight fucking murders!

22:31.200 --> 22:32.640
He always claimed he didn't do it.

22:33.160 --> 22:35.240
And we all agreed that he couldn't have.

22:36.440 --> 22:39.480
Besides, why in the world
would he kill Kowalski?

22:41.640 --> 22:43.240
Do you know what I think?

22:44.000 --> 22:46.319
Arthur is an arrogant son of a bitch.

22:47.960 --> 22:49.119
But he's not a killer.

22:52.720 --> 22:55.240
We must communicate this immediately
to the Chilean Police.

22:55.319 --> 22:57.640
Not so fast. You still have
a confidentiality agreement.

22:57.720 --> 22:59.640
- You can't be serious.
- I am.

22:59.720 --> 23:00.720
This is a crime.

23:00.799 --> 23:02.880
There is a killer on the ship,
and I am the Captain.

23:02.960 --> 23:04.119
She must be on board.

23:07.440 --> 23:09.519
The head is a message. To me.

23:11.440 --> 23:12.640
It can only be Maggie.

23:15.200 --> 23:17.519
Could there be somebody unaccounted for
on the ship?

23:18.000 --> 23:20.119
No. We've been at sea
for nine weeks now.

23:20.200 --> 23:21.839
- We would have found out.
- Would we?

23:21.920 --> 23:25.400
It's a bloody big ship.
We haven't set foot on most of it.

23:25.480 --> 23:26.799
No, that can't be.

23:26.880 --> 23:29.759
The expedition was prepared
under the strictest security measures.

23:29.839 --> 23:32.440
No one knew any details of our trip.

23:32.519 --> 23:34.519
Well, clearly you failed.

23:36.640 --> 23:39.839
If she's not on board the ship,
then someone must be working for her.

23:40.319 --> 23:42.720
All scientists and crew
were thoroughly screened

23:42.799 --> 23:44.279
as per your instructions.

23:44.359 --> 23:47.680
He was decapitated, for Christ's sake!

23:52.599 --> 23:55.599
I want to return to land immediately.
I want everyone replaced.

23:55.680 --> 23:57.200
That includes the two of you.

23:57.279 --> 23:59.720
We are over 1,600 miles away from land.

24:00.720 --> 24:03.799
It will take us the best of four days
to get back to Valparaiso.

24:03.880 --> 24:05.000
Four days?

24:07.079 --> 24:08.160
Then God help us.

24:09.559 --> 24:10.880
Because if it is Maggie,

24:12.920 --> 24:14.440
she's just getting started.

24:25.880 --> 24:28.720
- Hey. Try to get some rest.
- Thanks.

24:32.799 --> 24:33.880
Can you feel that?

24:34.519 --> 24:35.519
Yeah.

24:37.079 --> 24:38.119
We're turning.

24:49.039 --> 24:50.960
Bearing is 68 degrees, Captain.

24:51.599 --> 24:53.359
- Full ahead.
- Full ahead.

25:09.680 --> 25:10.839
All right, guys, ready?

25:10.920 --> 25:13.200
Let's go! One, two, three, pull!

25:13.519 --> 25:14.920
Come on.

25:15.000 --> 25:16.640
Come on, Charlie, pull!

25:16.720 --> 25:19.680
Come on, Charlie, pull!

25:19.759 --> 25:22.519
- Pull!
- Come on, guys, one, two...

25:24.839 --> 25:25.920
Pull!

25:26.720 --> 25:27.720
Come on!

25:53.599 --> 25:54.799
So...

25:59.880 --> 26:01.160
We are headed back to land.

26:04.079 --> 26:07.720
As much as we are all shocked
by this unspeakable crime,

26:08.839 --> 26:11.839
I beg you all to keep calm
until we reach Valparaiso.

26:12.200 --> 26:14.559
Chilean Police
will take care of the investigation.

26:18.359 --> 26:19.799
For fuck's sake...

26:20.400 --> 26:22.000
- What was that, pal?
- Tell the big guy

26:22.079 --> 26:24.480
to put his fucking rat away,
that's what it was.

26:24.559 --> 26:27.279
And you better fucking leave him
the fuck alone, okay?

26:28.680 --> 26:30.039
Gentlemen, please,

26:30.119 --> 26:33.920
if there is anything you might know
that might clarify, speak up.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.839
One of my butcher's knives is missing.

26:36.799 --> 26:38.039
It was there last night.

26:40.079 --> 26:41.079
Not anymore.

26:42.880 --> 26:43.920
I saw him last night.

26:46.279 --> 26:47.359
In here.

26:48.160 --> 26:50.119
- So?
- What time?

26:50.920 --> 26:54.440
Beginning of my shift, around 4 a.m.

26:56.799 --> 26:58.039
Motherfucker.

26:58.480 --> 26:59.440
Fuck you!

27:00.079 --> 27:02.319
- I came to get some juice.
- Sure you did.

27:02.720 --> 27:04.519
Fuck you too! Cocksucker!

27:05.680 --> 27:07.119
What is that supposed to mean?

27:07.720 --> 27:08.880
You know what it means.

27:09.519 --> 27:10.519
We all do.

27:16.799 --> 27:18.079
Actually, we don't, Zack.

27:18.759 --> 27:20.680
We have no idea
what you're talking about.

27:21.839 --> 27:25.319
Our boatswain here and mister Kowalski
were very special friends.

27:29.079 --> 27:31.519
I don't know, maybe he wouldn’t let him
suck his dick anymore

27:31.599 --> 27:32.839
and he lost it.

27:33.559 --> 27:35.960
- Marcus! Don't!
- Stop!

27:36.039 --> 27:38.119
Marcus, stop! Marcus!

27:38.200 --> 27:40.519
- Stop!
- Stoppit!

27:41.920 --> 27:43.680
- No, no!
- You wanna kill me too?

27:43.759 --> 27:45.400
- Stoppit!
- Stop!

27:45.480 --> 27:47.200
- No, Marcus, don't!
- Stop! Fuck it!

27:47.720 --> 27:49.240
Alright. Stop it now!

27:50.160 --> 27:51.279
Everyone out!

27:51.359 --> 27:53.400
Calm down! Everyone out!

28:15.400 --> 28:17.960
A religious, conservative, family man.

28:18.039 --> 28:19.279
And a great seaman too.

28:20.039 --> 28:22.079
Sailed with him for 25 years now.

28:23.720 --> 28:28.079
Were you aware of what was going on
between him and Kowalski?

28:29.640 --> 28:32.400
I was given a heads-up
by a member of the crew, yes.

28:33.519 --> 28:35.359
But it’s none of my business

28:35.440 --> 28:39.079
what people on my ship do
with their private lives, okay?

28:39.160 --> 28:41.119
Not him, not anybody else.

28:42.599 --> 28:43.640
Let him in!

28:51.160 --> 28:53.359
You will stay in your cabin
until we reach land.

29:02.240 --> 29:04.119
- I did not do it.
- Didn’t do what?

29:04.960 --> 29:06.079
Any of it.

29:06.640 --> 29:08.880
- I’m a decent man.
- I never said you weren't.

29:11.119 --> 29:12.079
What’s that?

29:15.359 --> 29:17.559
That fucking wuss
must have scratched me.

29:17.920 --> 29:20.519
You know, you were ready to kill him
if we hadn’t stopped you.

29:20.599 --> 29:24.000
I will happily rip his fucking head off
if I have a chance.

29:26.599 --> 29:27.920
But Kowalski?

29:30.400 --> 29:31.640
But Kowalski, no.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.480
Well, if that’s the case,
you have nothing to worry about.

29:40.640 --> 29:42.599
Don't move from here, you stay put, okay?

29:45.319 --> 29:46.359
Captain,

29:48.799 --> 29:52.160
it's been a great honour
to sail under your command.

30:02.720 --> 30:04.359
<i>Family is the most important.</i>

30:04.799 --> 30:08.000
<i>My wife, my two kids,</i>
<i>Antoine and Marie.</i>

30:10.279 --> 30:12.319
<i>They are in good health, thanks God.</i>

30:13.359 --> 30:16.440
<i>And all I wish is to make them grow</i>
<i>as happy as possible,</i>

30:16.519 --> 30:17.799
<i>that's all I pray for.</i>

30:17.880 --> 30:19.440
<i>You are a very religious man.</i>

30:19.519 --> 30:21.279
<i>Yes, I'm a religious man.</i>

30:22.559 --> 30:25.839
They told us
those interviews would be private, no?

30:26.680 --> 30:28.799
Is that why
you didn't want to take part in them?

30:29.480 --> 30:32.640
I don't believe
in that psychological bullshit.

30:33.119 --> 30:34.079
I know.

30:35.839 --> 30:38.400
<i>What would you consider</i>
<i>to be one of your strengths?</i>

30:40.720 --> 30:41.640
<i>My faith.</i>

30:42.480 --> 30:44.720
<i>And what would you say</i>
<i>is one of your weaknesses?</i>

30:48.759 --> 30:50.559
We are all sinners, are we not?

30:55.880 --> 30:56.880
I need your help.

30:59.880 --> 31:01.759
I need to find someone on the internet.

31:02.440 --> 31:03.880
Can we do that from here?

31:03.960 --> 31:06.359
We are not allowed
to use the satellite connection

31:06.440 --> 31:07.519
for any personal matter.

31:08.279 --> 31:09.680
Alec doesn't need to know.

31:13.920 --> 31:16.319
Does the name Maggie Mitchell
mean anything to you?

31:17.480 --> 31:21.599
Yeah, the doctor from Polaris,
the one who testified against you.

31:21.680 --> 31:22.799
She framed me.

31:23.400 --> 31:27.640
I'm convinced that she had something to do
with Kowalski's murder.

31:27.720 --> 31:29.559
And I need to find out where she is.

31:30.640 --> 31:32.319
I need your help, Yuto.

31:33.279 --> 31:35.319
Alright. I can try.

31:38.599 --> 31:39.680
Rachel.

31:45.480 --> 31:47.119
She's just getting some air.

31:47.200 --> 31:48.200
Starboard deck.

31:52.960 --> 31:54.559
- You alright?
- Yeah.

31:58.720 --> 31:59.759
It's just...

32:02.960 --> 32:05.680
You know? When I didn't make it
into the Polaris team...

32:06.759 --> 32:07.960
I was devastated.

32:09.759 --> 32:11.599
And I hated you so much.

32:13.720 --> 32:16.599
And then, it turned out
I'd been so lucky not to go.

32:19.079 --> 32:20.079
And now...

32:23.759 --> 32:25.359
I just want to get back home.

32:27.240 --> 32:28.480
Hey.

32:31.440 --> 32:32.559
It's alright.

32:40.319 --> 32:41.400
I'm sorry.

32:43.240 --> 32:44.680
Only four days to go.

32:44.759 --> 32:45.880
Yeah.

32:51.160 --> 32:52.240
Okay.

32:53.839 --> 32:54.920
I have to go.

32:55.279 --> 32:56.279
Thank you.

33:14.839 --> 33:16.039
Rachel.

33:18.640 --> 33:20.720
Rachel,
you shouldn't be out walking on your own.

33:22.640 --> 33:24.119
Hello, Arthur.

33:25.839 --> 33:27.519
Did you really think I wouldn't find you?

33:28.519 --> 33:29.599
Arthur.

33:30.160 --> 33:31.480
Are you okay?

33:36.160 --> 33:38.200
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

33:41.279 --> 33:42.400
And you?

33:45.119 --> 33:46.240
I'm afraid.

33:47.319 --> 33:48.400
Me too.

33:49.640 --> 33:51.119
Rachel, I'm... I'm sorry

33:51.200 --> 33:53.079
that I've dragged you
into the middle of all this,

33:54.079 --> 33:56.319
but I'd rather
you don't walk around on your own.

33:57.000 --> 33:58.160
Okay.

34:03.400 --> 34:05.000
Arthur, we need to talk about Polaris.

34:07.799 --> 34:09.440
What do you want to know?

34:09.880 --> 34:11.519
Sorry for interrupting.

34:13.119 --> 34:14.119
We need to talk.

34:15.079 --> 34:16.519
No, no, it's alright.

34:17.400 --> 34:18.400
Tell me.

34:18.840 --> 34:21.480
Marcus denies everything,
but we've got the upper hand.

34:22.960 --> 34:24.280
His neck is scratched.

34:25.159 --> 34:27.559
And I found torn skin
under Kowaslki's fingernails.

34:27.639 --> 34:29.480
So, they must have fought.

34:29.559 --> 34:31.440
Jesus Christ.

34:31.800 --> 34:34.480
The Chilean Police can analyze the DNA
and get confirmation.

34:34.559 --> 34:35.679
Good.

34:35.760 --> 34:37.400
No, we don't need the Chilean Police.

34:37.480 --> 34:39.360
We've got everything
that we need on board.

34:40.360 --> 34:42.440
And we could achieve it
much more efficiently

34:42.519 --> 34:44.960
than maybe the Chilean Police could.

34:45.039 --> 34:48.159
Yeah. Zack could get everything sorted
in less than 24 hours.

34:49.559 --> 34:51.000
Yeah, sounds like a good idea.

34:53.440 --> 34:57.119
Well, all we need now
is a sample from Marcus.

34:57.599 --> 34:59.639
Or better yet,
a sample from everyone on the ship.

34:59.719 --> 35:01.199
You don't think it was Marcus?

35:01.280 --> 35:03.960
I don't understand
why he would cut off Kowalski's head.

35:04.960 --> 35:06.079
She's right.

35:07.400 --> 35:08.559
Let's do everyone.

35:11.679 --> 35:12.800
Alright, doctor Wilde,

35:12.880 --> 35:15.519
I'm just gonna need to swab this
on the side of your cheek.

35:20.119 --> 35:22.440
Alright, thank you. That's all we need.

35:26.280 --> 35:27.559
Here's Arthur's.

35:31.679 --> 35:33.159
- Thank you.
- That's it?

35:33.239 --> 35:34.639
- That's it.
- Alright.

35:35.880 --> 35:36.880
Alec.

35:42.599 --> 35:43.599
Thank you.

35:53.639 --> 35:54.840
- You ready?
- Yep.

35:59.280 --> 36:00.400
Who's next?

36:00.480 --> 36:03.840
Are you saying that we have to do
whatever those psychos want us to do?

36:03.920 --> 36:06.000
Because I can't believe
you're taking their side.

36:06.079 --> 36:09.039
- Do you have a better solution?
- We don't care about your solutions.

36:09.119 --> 36:11.480
- I should stop talking? Says who?
- Stop, stop!

36:11.559 --> 36:14.199
My men will do this.
But they don't trust him.

36:15.400 --> 36:17.599
Okay, so Rachel can do it.

36:18.519 --> 36:21.639
This is no witch hunt, Captain,
this is science.

36:26.719 --> 36:27.719
Okay.

36:38.880 --> 36:40.320
This is just a load of crap.

36:40.639 --> 36:43.000
It's also the fastest way
to prove your innocence.

36:46.400 --> 36:48.559
You can refuse to take part
if that's what you want.

36:48.639 --> 36:51.440
Oh, sure,
and how would that make me look?

36:52.840 --> 36:53.800
This way.

37:00.320 --> 37:01.440
Okay. Ready?

37:04.280 --> 37:05.320
Open your mouth.

37:22.239 --> 37:23.679
Have you got something for me?

37:24.000 --> 37:26.119
Maggie Mitchell is nowhere to be found,

37:26.199 --> 37:28.239
but many people out there
are talking about you.

37:29.039 --> 37:30.159
Look at this icegirl.

37:30.239 --> 37:32.360
"I hope the bastard rots in hell."

37:32.440 --> 37:34.440
This was posted the day I was arrested.

37:34.519 --> 37:37.920
Yes. She only posted that day,
and never again until March 9th.

37:38.000 --> 37:39.119
The day I got out.

37:40.480 --> 37:43.320
She hasn't stopped since.
Wasn't happy to see you go.

37:44.039 --> 37:46.920
And this is the last one. Yesterday night.

37:47.760 --> 37:50.039
"Arthur, I know
that you will read this someday."

37:50.480 --> 37:51.559
She got that right.

37:51.639 --> 37:54.199
"You must know
that there's no getting away from me.

37:54.280 --> 37:56.320
I will make you pay for your crimes."

37:56.400 --> 37:57.480
Can we write back?

37:59.960 --> 38:01.039
Sure.

38:03.320 --> 38:05.760
"Hello, Icegirl.
Or should I call you Maggie?

38:10.320 --> 38:12.760
You should have killed me
when you had the chance.

38:13.199 --> 38:14.599
And the same goes for me."

38:16.440 --> 38:19.440
Go on, go ahead, write it.
That way she'll know it's from me.

38:25.760 --> 38:26.760
Now what?

38:27.480 --> 38:29.679
If she writes back, maybe I can trace her.

38:31.039 --> 38:32.000
Okay.

38:32.400 --> 38:33.800
Well done.

38:33.880 --> 38:35.639
- Keep me posted.
- Yeah.

38:41.519 --> 38:43.280
Done. Well done.

39:05.400 --> 39:06.480
What's that?

39:06.960 --> 39:08.760
That is the reason we're all here.

39:13.360 --> 39:14.679
And what is it?

39:15.599 --> 39:17.639
I doubt very much
you'd understand, Charlie.

39:23.960 --> 39:25.559
I'm not stupid.

39:28.639 --> 39:30.880
- Was he the last one?
- All but.

39:30.960 --> 39:32.199
We need Marcus'.

39:32.639 --> 39:34.760
I'm not going
anywhere near that son of a bitch.

40:00.559 --> 40:02.880
<i>Rachel, next track!</i>

40:03.320 --> 40:06.400
<i>When I wake up,</i>
<i>well I know I'm gonna be,</i>

40:06.480 --> 40:09.400
<i>I'm gonna be</i>
<i>the man who wakes up next to you.</i>

40:09.840 --> 40:13.159
<i>When I go out,</i>
<i>well, I know I'm gonna be,</i>

40:13.239 --> 40:16.360
<i>I'm gonna be</i>
<i>the man who goes along with you.</i>

40:17.320 --> 40:18.679
<i>If I get drunk...</i>

40:25.840 --> 40:26.880
It's my fault.

40:28.039 --> 40:29.039
It's my fault.

40:30.079 --> 40:31.599
It's all my fault.

40:37.360 --> 40:39.199
- I think he knows.
- Who?

40:39.280 --> 40:41.599
- Your father. About us.
- He doesn't.

40:41.679 --> 40:43.000
I think he does.

40:45.199 --> 40:47.519
Good for him if he does.
I couldn't care less.

40:48.719 --> 40:50.639
I could. It's Alec!

40:50.719 --> 40:53.679
<i>And I would walk 500 miles.</i>

40:53.760 --> 40:56.559
<i>And I would walk 500...</i>

41:02.079 --> 41:03.079
Fuck!

41:11.719 --> 41:12.960
Marcus!

41:15.320 --> 41:16.400
Marcus!

41:39.519 --> 41:40.679
<i>Kiss, kiss, kiss!</i>

41:40.760 --> 41:42.119
<i>Holy shit!</i>

41:42.480 --> 41:44.480
<i>I love you, guys!</i>

41:53.480 --> 41:54.760
The note is in French.

41:54.840 --> 41:57.920
Marcus only asks for God's mercy
and his family's forgiveness.

41:58.880 --> 41:59.880
Fucking hell.

42:02.000 --> 42:03.159
I suppose he was worried

42:03.239 --> 42:05.199
that they might find out
about him and Kowalski.

42:06.960 --> 42:09.039
I'm sure the DNA test
will confirm it was him.

42:10.360 --> 42:11.920
Guess I was wrong about Maggie.

42:12.639 --> 42:14.079
You can't blame yourself for that.

42:14.400 --> 42:16.199
The head
was some fucking smokescreen.

42:17.079 --> 42:18.400
The art of deception.

42:19.199 --> 42:22.599
Russians have a word for it...
Can't remember what it was.

42:59.239 --> 43:00.880
At least, another four hours to go.

43:05.440 --> 43:06.400
Thanks.

43:13.440 --> 43:14.840
Why do you hate him so much?

43:16.119 --> 43:17.360
Your father.

43:20.159 --> 43:21.480
He was never really there.

43:22.960 --> 43:24.119
I never had a father.

43:27.960 --> 43:28.960
I see.

43:33.039 --> 43:34.599
My father never lived with us.

43:36.280 --> 43:37.920
He had a drinking problem.

43:39.320 --> 43:40.639
He was a very violent man.

43:42.920 --> 43:44.679
When I was ten years old,

43:45.599 --> 43:48.400
I was home alone
when someone broke in the house,

43:49.719 --> 43:50.960
so I hid in the closet.

43:53.320 --> 43:54.320
It was my father.

43:55.559 --> 43:59.159
He was looking
for some cash or something to sell.

44:02.000 --> 44:03.320
He opened the closet door.

44:05.119 --> 44:07.760
And we just stared at each other.

44:11.039 --> 44:14.159
And then I...
I literally pissed in my pants.

44:19.119 --> 44:20.519
And then he just ran away.

44:23.320 --> 44:24.920
And that was the last time I saw him.

44:29.039 --> 44:30.079
I'm sorry.

44:33.840 --> 44:35.599
Your father is a fucking genius.

44:37.280 --> 44:40.480
Whatever he had to sacrifice
to get this far was totally worth it.

44:41.679 --> 44:42.880
And that includes you.

45:40.880 --> 45:43.760
<i>To survive, one must have a plan.</i>

45:43.840 --> 45:45.400
<i>But there's nothing to worry about.</i>

45:46.239 --> 45:48.360
<i>Soon we'll reach the supply ship,</i>

45:48.440 --> 45:50.400
<i>and then we'll all have food and water.</i>

45:51.079 --> 45:52.880
<i>Too bad Schmidt couldn't have waited.</i>

45:52.960 --> 45:54.159
<i>You!</i>

45:58.119 --> 45:59.320
Good night.

46:01.159 --> 46:02.760
- Charlie.
- What?

46:04.239 --> 46:05.599
Watch out.

46:26.000 --> 46:27.079
How long's left?

46:28.039 --> 46:30.719
-About another hour and a half.
- Okay.

46:32.480 --> 46:33.880
Do you mind if I take a nap?

46:34.880 --> 46:36.159
Sure. Go ahead.

46:36.599 --> 46:37.639
Thanks.

47:18.800 --> 47:21.320
Fuck.

47:27.239 --> 47:28.880
Rachel, wake up! Here we go!

47:33.159 --> 47:34.159
Fuck.

47:34.480 --> 47:36.079
Rachel, wake up! It isn't Marcus!

48:58.920 --> 48:59.960
Holy shit.

49:02.400 --> 49:03.440
Rachel!
