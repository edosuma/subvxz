00:00.210 --> 00:01.670
- Previously, on "Nashville"...

00:01.670 --> 00:03.170
- You know Jessie Caine?
- Yeah for along time.

00:03.170 --> 00:04.750
- Nice to see you.

00:04.750 --> 00:06.790
- You want to sign her.
- I got a feeling about her.

00:06.790 --> 00:09.500
- You're close with Rayna's
daughter, Maddie, aren't you?

00:09.500 --> 00:12.250
I got a song I think
would be great for her.

00:12.250 --> 00:14.330
I'm happy to pass it along.

00:14.330 --> 00:16.500
She just doesn't think that it's
quite right for her.

00:16.500 --> 00:19.460
What if I record the song
and I put it on my album.

00:19.460 --> 00:22.120
- Give me your wallet.
- Here's my wallet.

00:22.120 --> 00:25.000
- You too.

00:25.000 --> 00:26.830
Look what you've done,
those are my shoes!

00:26.830 --> 00:28.500
Get on your knees.

00:36.420 --> 00:37.920
(gasps)

00:47.330 --> 00:48.710
- Morning.
- Morning.

00:50.880 --> 00:51.880
- Thank you for staying over.

00:51.880 --> 00:53.380
- Sure.

00:53.380 --> 00:55.380
- How's your head?
It really got hit hard.

00:55.380 --> 00:58.210
- Oh, it's fine.
Don't worry about me.

00:58.210 --> 00:59.290
You all right?

00:59.290 --> 01:00.670
- E.M.T. said I was fine, so...

01:02.710 --> 01:05.330
- Listen, the station called--
- I really think we should--

01:05.330 --> 01:06.620
- You go ahead.

01:06.620 --> 01:08.210
- Um, yeah...
The station called,

01:08.210 --> 01:09.880
they wanted us to come back in,
and look at some photos.

01:09.880 --> 01:10.880
- They caught the guy?

01:10.880 --> 01:12.500
- Yeah, a suspect, so...

01:12.500 --> 01:14.290
- I mean, not that
that's amazing,

01:14.290 --> 01:17.670
I just didn't think
we'd have to see him ever again.

01:17.670 --> 01:19.080
Makes my stomach turn.

01:19.080 --> 01:20.880
- Now, listen, you stay here.
I'll go.

01:20.880 --> 01:22.080
You shouldn't' have to go
through all that again.

01:23.710 --> 01:25.670
I got a better look
at him anyway.

01:25.670 --> 01:27.040
- Thank you.

01:31.080 --> 01:33.620
- All right, can we go?
I want to be early.

01:33.620 --> 01:36.790
- I never seen anybody in such a
hurry to get to summer school.

01:36.790 --> 01:38.920
- They hang out before class.

01:38.920 --> 01:41.710
- That include your boyfriend?

01:41.710 --> 01:42.710
- What boyfriend?

01:42.710 --> 01:45.080
- Flynn?

01:45.080 --> 01:46.710
- Flynn is not my boyfriend!

01:46.710 --> 01:48.330
- Well, that's good.
'Cause if he was,

01:48.330 --> 01:50.000
I would need to have
a long talk

01:50.000 --> 01:51.670
with that young man
about his intentions.

01:51.670 --> 01:53.920
- Oh, God, please be kidding.

01:53.920 --> 01:55.580
(phone beep)
- Claybourne, it's Hank Morris.

01:55.580 --> 01:58.000
I heard through the grapevine

01:58.000 --> 01:59.620
you're talking about
singing Jessie Caine.

01:59.620 --> 02:01.210
Any truth to that?
Call me.

02:01.210 --> 02:03.080
- Who's that?

02:03.080 --> 02:05.420
- Uh, just a manager
looking for my...

02:05.420 --> 02:07.290
advice on something.

02:07.290 --> 02:09.420
- Who would want your advice?

02:09.420 --> 02:10.880
- You know, I think I might
walk you into school today.

02:10.880 --> 02:12.040
- Oh, no, you won't!

02:13.750 --> 02:17.000
- J, I bow to you.
"Water Rising" is on fire.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.460
50,000 downloads since Monday
and still climbing.

02:19.460 --> 02:23.000
Back on top.
Knew you could do it.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.330
- I think we all knew
I could do it, but--whatever.

02:25.330 --> 02:26.830
- Well, the promo party
on Friday

02:26.830 --> 02:28.330
is going to be insane.

02:28.330 --> 02:30.170
We have Rolling Stone,
Entertainment Weekly.

02:30.170 --> 02:32.580
Pitchfork, CMT--
Hey!

02:32.580 --> 02:33.960
- Hey. Sorry.
Am I interrupting?

02:33.960 --> 02:35.750
- No, not at all.
- Oh, hey!

02:35.750 --> 02:37.540
- I asked Maddie to pop in.

02:37.540 --> 02:39.830
Because I kind of got a crazy
idea on my run this morning.

02:39.830 --> 02:41.420
And I wanted to pitch it
to both of you.

02:41.420 --> 02:43.580
So Maddie is singing
at the Wildhorse Saloon tonight.

02:43.580 --> 02:44.960
And I know it's a little bit
last minute,

02:44.960 --> 02:47.290
but what if Juliette
were to drop by

02:47.290 --> 02:49.290
for a little guest appearance?

02:49.290 --> 02:50.460
- That would be amazing.

02:53.330 --> 02:54.920
- That would be great.

02:54.920 --> 02:56.830
- Yeah? I was just thinking
just a short moment

02:56.830 --> 02:58.290
near the end of the set,

02:58.290 --> 03:00.000
and maybe you two sing
"Water Rising" together.

03:00.000 --> 03:04.460
- Oh...um, yeah,
I mean, I love that song.

03:04.460 --> 03:05.790
It's just,
it's Juliette's, really,

03:05.790 --> 03:07.540
I don't know if
I could it much justice.

03:07.540 --> 03:09.880
- What are you talking about?
Of course, you can.

03:09.880 --> 03:11.750
We can sing it together.

03:11.750 --> 03:14.170
- Okay! That's such a dream
to do that song with you.

03:14.170 --> 03:16.080
- You should meet Travis Stroud,
the writer.

03:16.080 --> 03:17.880
He is fantastic.

03:17.880 --> 03:19.170
You're gonna be at the promo
party Friday night, right?

03:19.170 --> 03:20.830
- Of course.
- Okay. (laughs)

03:20.830 --> 03:22.420
- All right, I should go.
But I will see you guys tonight.

03:22.420 --> 03:24.040
- All right.
Thanks for coming in, Maddie.

03:24.040 --> 03:26.250
Awesome.
That's gonna be cool.

03:26.250 --> 03:28.500
Thank you so much for that.

03:28.500 --> 03:29.880
- You're welcome.

03:29.880 --> 03:32.620
- All right, take care.
Hey, sweetie?

03:32.620 --> 03:36.580
Tell Flynn I said hi.
(chuckles)

03:43.620 --> 03:45.460
- Hello?

03:45.460 --> 03:48.210
- Jessie? It's Deacon.
- Hi.

03:48.210 --> 03:50.250
- I got a call
from this manager, Hank Morris.

03:50.250 --> 03:52.500
Wanted the scoop on you.

03:52.500 --> 03:56.580
- Oh, okay...
So what's the scoop on me?

03:56.580 --> 03:58.460
- Ha, you tell me.
When's your next show?

03:58.460 --> 04:01.670
- Um, I'm actually playing
The Bluebird tonight.

04:01.670 --> 04:03.790
But it's just a small--
- No, that's perfect.

04:03.790 --> 04:06.170
I'll just tell his office

04:06.170 --> 04:07.620
to get in touch
for tickets then, okay?

04:07.620 --> 04:11.500
- Deacon, that's...thank you.

04:11.500 --> 04:14.170
- It's nothing.
All right, take care.

04:21.330 --> 04:22.750
- No. He's not there.

04:22.750 --> 04:24.710
- Are you sure?

04:24.710 --> 04:26.920
- Trust me, I'd know that
little punk's face anywhere.

04:26.920 --> 04:28.420
- Okay.

05:08.670 --> 05:11.080
(cell phone rings)

05:11.080 --> 05:13.080
- Well, good morning, sunshine.

05:13.080 --> 05:15.790
Hello?

05:15.790 --> 05:17.330
Scarlett, what's wrong?

05:19.080 --> 05:22.080
Scarlett?
Scarlett!

05:23.540 --> 05:24.790
- In here!

05:31.380 --> 05:33.330
- Okay, okay, I got you.

05:33.330 --> 05:36.080
I got you, I got you.

05:36.080 --> 05:38.170
It's okay.
Let's go, let's go.

05:55.830 --> 05:58.710
- Want me to call Gunnar?
- No.

05:58.710 --> 06:00.250
No, I don't want to
freak him out.

06:00.250 --> 06:03.000
And I don't want him
to freak me out.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.080
Besides, a bunch of these
sites are saying

06:05.080 --> 06:07.120
that bleeding can happen.

06:07.120 --> 06:09.040
It doesn't necessarily
mean anything's wrong.

06:09.040 --> 06:10.540
- O'Connor?

06:12.540 --> 06:15.210
- Hey, you two.

06:15.210 --> 06:17.620
- Look, Mommy's home!
- Hi, baby!

06:20.880 --> 06:22.330
What are these?

06:22.330 --> 06:23.750
- From Travis.

06:23.750 --> 06:25.880
- Huh.

06:25.880 --> 06:27.460
- Hey, Juliette, what's up?

06:27.460 --> 06:29.540
- I wanted to thank you
for the gorgeous flowers.

06:29.540 --> 06:30.710
- The least I could do
for the gal

06:30.710 --> 06:32.250
that made "Water Rising"
a hit.

06:32.250 --> 06:36.790
- (laughs)
Hey, you're a Beck fan, right?

06:36.790 --> 06:38.420
Or am I thinking
about someone else?

06:38.420 --> 06:39.790
- No, that's me.

06:39.790 --> 06:41.460
He's one of my all-time heroes.

06:41.460 --> 06:43.290
- Well, you know
that he's playing

06:43.290 --> 06:44.750
at The Ryman
on Friday night?

06:44.750 --> 06:46.250
- What? I had no idea.

06:46.250 --> 06:48.790
I have a Google alert
on him and everything.

06:48.790 --> 06:50.960
- I think it was
a last-minute thing.

06:50.960 --> 06:52.670
But I'm pretty sure I can
get you in if you want.

06:52.670 --> 06:56.420
- Are you serious?
Juliette, that would be amazing.

06:56.420 --> 07:00.290
But--wait.
Isn't your party that night?

07:00.290 --> 07:02.000
- It's gonna be so boring.

07:02.000 --> 07:05.790
Please, I wouldn't go
if I didn't have to.

07:05.790 --> 07:09.000
- Well, as long
as you don't mind.

07:11.040 --> 07:12.210
- Oh, I don't mind.

07:14.120 --> 07:15.960
- I know it's hard.
Just try to relax.

07:15.960 --> 07:17.620
- Is she okay?

07:23.170 --> 07:26.790
- I'm so sorry.

07:26.790 --> 07:28.210
Your baby's heart
has stopped beating.

07:28.210 --> 07:32.330
- Oh. No, no.

07:33.830 --> 07:36.880
- You can see there's no motion.

07:36.880 --> 07:41.080
I'm gonna have my colleague
come and confirm it

07:41.080 --> 07:43.710
to be absolutely certain.

07:43.710 --> 07:47.580
- No, no.
- Hey. Shh...

07:47.580 --> 07:50.290
- I don't know what to do.

08:11.790 --> 08:14.210
- Is she all right?
- She will be.

08:14.210 --> 08:17.290
- I can't believe this.

08:17.290 --> 08:20.420
- Take a breath, all right?

08:20.420 --> 08:21.750
She's hanging in there,

08:21.750 --> 08:22.880
but if she sees you
falling apart...

08:22.880 --> 08:24.420
- I won't, I won't.

08:24.420 --> 08:26.120
- You got this.
Just go be with her. Be strong.

08:31.120 --> 08:32.620
- Scarlett?

08:32.620 --> 08:35.080
- I'm okay, It's okay.

08:36.790 --> 08:39.040
- What happens now?

08:39.040 --> 08:43.000
- I've got to wait here
until she...comes out.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.380
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

08:45.380 --> 08:47.880
- How are we doing in here?
- The same.

08:47.880 --> 08:50.210
- Hi. I'm Doctor Pine.

08:50.210 --> 08:52.080
- Is this 'cause of last night?
Isn't it?

08:52.080 --> 08:53.540
- Last night?

08:53.540 --> 08:55.080
- I told the ER nurse
what happened.

08:55.080 --> 08:59.000
- We were robbed.
There was a guy with a gun.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.380
He knocked her down.

09:00.380 --> 09:02.330
- I'm so sorry that happened.

09:02.330 --> 09:03.960
When you fell,
was it on your stomach

09:03.960 --> 09:05.620
or were you hit there?

09:05.620 --> 09:08.000
- Not there.
- I was just terrified.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.420
- Of course.
It must have been awful.

09:09.420 --> 09:12.710
But it wouldn't
affect your pregnancy.

09:12.710 --> 09:14.540
- How could it not?

09:14.540 --> 09:16.380
- I know it may be hard
to believe, but it's true.

09:16.380 --> 09:18.170
I've seen many patients
through this ordeal.

09:18.170 --> 09:21.120
Patients who are sure a certain
event caused the miscarriage.

09:21.120 --> 09:23.920
And I have to tell them
that's not how it works.

09:23.920 --> 09:26.380
- Why?

09:26.380 --> 09:27.920
- It's difficult to pinpoint
the exact cause.

09:27.920 --> 09:29.750
Often it's
a chromosomal problem.

09:29.750 --> 09:32.620
If you'd like, we can do a test
to see if that was the case.

09:32.620 --> 09:34.460
But I can tell you,

09:34.460 --> 09:36.540
it's not because of anything
you did or didn't do.

09:39.830 --> 09:42.670
- (groans)
- Can you give her something?

09:42.670 --> 09:44.290
- Scarlett knows her options.
- I don't want anything...

09:44.290 --> 09:46.620
- But you're in pain.
- Okay, I'm sorry.

09:46.620 --> 09:48.960
I need you to go.
And take Deacon with you.

09:48.960 --> 09:51.040
I can't have either
of you in the room.

09:51.040 --> 09:54.210
I need to do it on my own.
Don't ask me why.

09:54.210 --> 09:56.580
It's what I need.
Please?

09:56.580 --> 09:57.750
- Okay.
I'm not going home, though.

09:57.750 --> 09:58.750
I'll be right outside.

09:58.750 --> 09:59.960
- Okay. Thank you.

10:14.210 --> 10:16.330
(cell phone rings)

10:18.120 --> 10:20.040
- Hey.
- Jessie, I am so sorry.

10:20.040 --> 10:22.290
I never got a chance
to call Hank.

10:22.290 --> 10:24.620
Something came up.
It was an emergency.

10:24.620 --> 10:27.960
- Is everything okay?

10:27.960 --> 10:32.710
- My niece, Scarlett,
I had to take her to the ER.

10:32.710 --> 10:35.000
She's pregnant...
she was pregnant.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.670
- Oh, no.
- I'm sorry.

10:36.670 --> 10:39.120
I wasn't even supposed
to tell you that.

10:39.120 --> 10:41.290
She doesn't want
the girls to know.

10:41.290 --> 10:45.420
- No, that's okay. That's...

10:45.420 --> 10:47.040
That's heartbreaking.

10:47.040 --> 10:51.210
- Yeah.
And her mom is gone.

10:51.210 --> 10:54.500
I'm her only family
and trying to be there for her.

10:54.500 --> 10:57.540
But I don't know
what to say, you know.

10:57.540 --> 11:00.080
- Dad, come here.

11:02.540 --> 11:05.580
- Listen, I got to go.
But I will call Hank, all right?

11:05.580 --> 11:08.460
I promise.
- No, no. That's okay, really.

11:08.460 --> 11:11.000
And thank you.

11:32.330 --> 11:33.620
- You don't have to do that.

11:33.620 --> 11:35.750
- It's okay.

11:35.750 --> 11:37.880
- There are clean sheets
in the...

11:37.880 --> 11:39.330
- Yeah, I know.

11:39.330 --> 11:42.170
(text message rings)

11:42.170 --> 11:44.120
What is it?

11:44.120 --> 11:45.460
- Alyssa wanting to talk details

11:45.460 --> 11:47.170
about the Women's Clinic
fundraiser.

11:47.170 --> 11:50.380
- Don't worry about that, okay?

11:50.380 --> 11:52.330
I'll just tell her
we can't do it.

11:52.330 --> 11:53.500
- Thank you.

11:54.920 --> 11:57.460
- Do you need anything?

11:57.460 --> 12:00.000
Water or juice or something?

12:00.000 --> 12:03.830
- I just need to be alone.

12:03.830 --> 12:06.960
- I don't feel right
just leaving you here.

12:06.960 --> 12:08.750
- It's what I need.

12:11.580 --> 12:13.080
- Okay.

12:13.080 --> 12:15.750
- Thank you.

12:18.120 --> 12:21.670
Gunnar?

12:21.670 --> 12:25.210
Please don't tell Alyssa
about the baby.

12:25.210 --> 12:27.080
I don't want anybody
to know yet.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.750
- Of course.

12:28.750 --> 12:30.830
- Thank you.

- Nope.

15:49.880 --> 15:51.250
Bastard's just gonna
get away with it.

15:51.250 --> 15:53.000
- Yeah.
I know how that feels.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.580
When those guys jumped
in Jackson Park,

15:55.580 --> 15:58.120
I was on edge for weeks.

15:58.120 --> 16:00.710
It sucks, but it'll get better.

16:00.710 --> 16:03.290
- It's not like what
happened with you, man.

16:03.290 --> 16:05.040
This was a stupid kid.
I could have taken him!

16:05.040 --> 16:07.380
- You said he had a gun.

16:07.380 --> 16:08.620
- Yeah, but I could've
gotten it away from him.

16:08.620 --> 16:10.880
I saw it all in my head, right?

16:10.880 --> 16:13.380
I use my left hand to make sure
the gun's away from Scarlett.

16:13.380 --> 16:16.580
I smash his nose with my right.
I grab him and move--

16:16.580 --> 16:18.290
- Yeah, I saw that movie too.

16:18.290 --> 16:19.750
I don't think it works
that way in the real world.

16:19.750 --> 16:21.380
- Yeah, I should have
at least tried, man.

16:21.380 --> 16:23.500
- You had her to think about.
- Yeah, exactly.

16:23.500 --> 16:26.250
He could have done
anything to her.

16:26.250 --> 16:29.960
I just stood there
too scared to move.

16:29.960 --> 16:32.330
- You did what anyone would do.

16:32.330 --> 16:34.750
And he didn't do anything
to hurt her--that's the point.

16:37.120 --> 16:39.380
You did the smartest thing
you could possibly do

16:39.380 --> 16:41.080
in that situation.

16:41.080 --> 16:43.830
And truth is, you both
got out of it okay.

16:43.830 --> 16:46.790
- Never mind.
You weren't there.

16:46.790 --> 16:49.290
- Gunnar?
- I'm going to bed.

17:12.290 --> 17:15.420
(gun cocks)

17:15.420 --> 17:17.420
- Get on your knees.

17:17.420 --> 17:19.920
(gasping)

17:46.540 --> 17:47.710
- Excuse me?

17:47.710 --> 17:50.500
- Oh, gosh.
I'm so sorry.

17:50.500 --> 17:51.620
I didn't mean to bother you.

17:51.620 --> 17:54.960
- Do I know you?
- No, um...

17:54.960 --> 17:56.420
- You're Jessie Caine.

17:56.420 --> 17:58.080
- Hi.

17:58.080 --> 17:59.290
- I have two of your albums.

17:59.290 --> 18:02.960
- Oh, thank you.
Um...

18:02.960 --> 18:06.000
I've been talking about
signing with your uncle.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.960
- Oh, okay, I got it.

18:07.960 --> 18:11.210
He actually doesn't
live here anymore. Sorry.

18:11.210 --> 18:14.960
- Right, I know.
I'm so sorry.

18:14.960 --> 18:16.920
I was just gonna
leave that and go.

18:16.920 --> 18:19.120
Deacon had mentioned that
you weren't feeling well.

18:19.120 --> 18:20.750
And I just wanted
to do something.

18:20.750 --> 18:22.210
But it was really stupid.
And I'm just gonna go...

18:22.210 --> 18:23.250
- Deacon told you?

18:23.250 --> 18:25.380
- He did not mean to, really.

18:25.380 --> 18:28.170
It slipped out.
And, um...

18:29.920 --> 18:32.170
It's just I...

18:32.170 --> 18:36.880
I have been through
that myself, twice.

18:36.880 --> 18:40.210
And there were certain things
that actually helped.

18:40.210 --> 18:43.000
Like there's some
raspberry leaf tea in there.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.250
Iron and calcium tables.

18:45.250 --> 18:47.040
Oh, I included the new
"Ghostbusters" DVD

18:47.040 --> 18:48.540
just for like a distraction.

18:48.540 --> 18:50.540
But, anyway,
I'm gonna stop talking now.

18:50.540 --> 18:53.830
I'm really sorry, again.

18:53.830 --> 18:55.330
- Wait.

18:55.330 --> 18:58.290
You said this
happened to you twice?

19:00.380 --> 19:02.210
- Once when I was 20.

19:02.210 --> 19:05.290
And then again,
when my husband and I

19:05.290 --> 19:09.880
were trying to start
a family, and...

19:09.880 --> 19:14.790
it was so hard and lonely.

19:14.790 --> 19:17.330
I guess I just hated the idea of
somebody else feeling that way.

19:17.330 --> 19:20.210
But I truly did not
mean to bother you.

19:20.210 --> 19:23.250
- You want to come in?

19:23.250 --> 19:27.330
- So I fall back
and I instantly know

19:27.330 --> 19:29.540
I'm gonna be the guy who died
trying to crowd surf.

19:29.540 --> 19:31.460
But they caught me, thank God.

19:31.460 --> 19:32.750
- I'm just jealous
of the folks who got

19:32.750 --> 19:35.040
to put their hands
all over you.

19:35.040 --> 19:36.380
- I wish I could be there
to celebrate you tonight.

19:36.380 --> 19:37.710
- Not me.

19:37.710 --> 19:39.830
I am doing just fine
without you.

19:39.830 --> 19:43.000
- Hey, J?
Maddie's here.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.210
- Okay. Can I call you back?
- Sure.

19:45.210 --> 19:46.790
- Will you give us a minute,
please?

19:46.790 --> 19:48.790
- Hey!
- Hey.

19:48.790 --> 19:51.120
- Sorry, is this a bad time?
I know you're getting ready.

19:51.120 --> 19:53.250
- Not at all.
What's up?

19:53.250 --> 19:56.710
- I just...it's about my show
the other night.

19:56.710 --> 19:58.460
It was so awesome of you
to do that.

19:58.460 --> 20:00.880
I don't want you to ever feel
like pressured into it.

20:00.880 --> 20:02.710
You've just done so much for me,

20:02.710 --> 20:04.290
and I don't want it
to ever seem like

20:04.290 --> 20:06.120
I'm using you or anything.

20:06.120 --> 20:07.670
- Stop.
You don't have to do this.

20:07.670 --> 20:09.000
I was thrilled to do your show.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.620
- Really?
(text message rings)

20:11.620 --> 20:14.000
You just left kind of quickly,
so I didn't know.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.330
- No, I'm just preoccupied

20:16.330 --> 20:19.500
with doing the new album,
and everything like that.

20:19.500 --> 20:21.250
- Yeah.
It must be crazy right now.

20:21.250 --> 20:24.710
- But we should sit down
and talk soon.

20:24.710 --> 20:26.330
Really talk.

20:26.330 --> 20:29.250
- Is everything okay?

20:29.250 --> 20:31.880
- Everything's fine.

20:31.880 --> 20:34.830
Just want you to know how
important you are to me.

20:34.830 --> 20:36.460
- Well, I would love that.

20:36.460 --> 20:38.500
Just let me know
whenever you're not busy.

20:38.500 --> 20:40.460
Which, clearly,
you are right now.

20:40.460 --> 20:41.710
So I'll see you at the party.

20:41.710 --> 20:44.290
- Thanks for stopping by.

21:22.290 --> 21:25.000
- I didn't think I knew anyone
this had happened to.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.620
And then I found out my mom,
my sister-in-law,

21:27.620 --> 21:30.290
and a girl I went
to high school with

21:30.290 --> 21:31.670
all went through it,

21:31.670 --> 21:33.710
but they just
hadn't talked about it.

21:33.710 --> 21:35.750
- None of my family
know except Deacon.

21:35.750 --> 21:38.000
And I just can't bear to think
of the looks on their faces

21:38.000 --> 21:39.540
when I got to tell
them that word.

21:39.540 --> 21:43.290
- Miscarriage,
like you dropped something.

21:43.290 --> 21:44.960
- Yeah, like you're supposed
to do something right

21:44.960 --> 21:46.460
and you couldn't.

21:46.460 --> 21:51.040
Might as well just
call it failure.

21:51.040 --> 21:52.920
- I was convinced
that it was my fault

21:52.920 --> 21:55.250
for sleeping on my stomach.

21:55.250 --> 21:57.460
And I treated myself
like a criminal.

21:57.460 --> 22:00.790
And it was my mom who finally
got through to me.

22:02.460 --> 22:05.000
And she said to take
some of that love

22:05.000 --> 22:09.420
that I felt for my baby boy,
and turn it in towards myself.

22:09.420 --> 22:13.080
Like, show myself
some of that tenderness.

22:13.080 --> 22:14.880
Of course,
it wasn't that simple.

22:14.880 --> 22:16.540
And it took a really long time.

22:16.540 --> 22:20.830
But I do think that
I had to forgive myself

22:20.830 --> 22:24.250
before I could actually
start grieving.

22:29.620 --> 22:32.710
- I got no memories.

22:32.710 --> 22:36.000
I never even got to
tell her her name.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.750
All I got is the blanket
they wrapped her in

22:38.750 --> 22:44.830
when they handed her to me,
because I asked to see her.

22:44.830 --> 22:46.500
Sorry.

22:46.500 --> 22:50.170
- No, don't say sorry.
I get it.

22:50.170 --> 22:53.210
And, I don't know,
it's hard to know how

22:53.210 --> 22:55.080
to say goodbye to somebody
that you've never met.

22:55.080 --> 22:58.750
And I wish that there was
some magic words of wisdom

22:58.750 --> 22:59.960
that I could share with you.

22:59.960 --> 23:02.540
- Oh, no, it's okay.

23:02.540 --> 23:03.960
- There's no reason
for you to think

23:03.960 --> 23:05.290
that you're not
gonna become a mom.

23:05.290 --> 23:06.750
- Yeah, the doctor said that.

23:06.750 --> 23:09.040
- Sure.
My doctor told me that too.

23:09.040 --> 23:12.170
But I was not able to hear it.

23:12.170 --> 23:16.540
So I'm telling you, okay?

23:16.540 --> 23:19.420
And don't be like me and go on
WebMD at three in the morning,

23:19.420 --> 23:20.830
and convince yourself
that you've got

23:20.830 --> 23:22.330
an incompetent cervix.

23:22.330 --> 23:23.960
- A what?

23:23.960 --> 23:25.540
- Yeah. Probably the
most insulting medical term

23:25.540 --> 23:27.710
in the world, right?
- That ain't a thing.

23:27.710 --> 23:30.330
- It is a for real medical term.
- Oh, my goodness!

23:30.330 --> 23:32.000
All I can think of
is a little cervix

23:32.000 --> 23:34.460
sitting in the corner
with a little dunce cap on.

23:34.460 --> 23:36.420
(laughing)

23:36.420 --> 23:39.580
- Hey.
- Hi.

23:39.580 --> 23:42.170
- Hey.

24:06.290 --> 24:07.580
- Get off me!

24:07.580 --> 24:08.830
- Remember me, huh?
- Get off me!

24:08.830 --> 24:10.170
- What you got now?

24:10.170 --> 24:11.920
- Come on, man!
You don't wanna do this!

24:11.920 --> 24:14.790
You too scared to fight
like a man?

24:14.790 --> 24:18.210
You know what you did?

24:18.210 --> 24:20.380
You know what you did,
you son of a bitch?

24:20.380 --> 24:22.290
- No, please!
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

24:22.290 --> 24:25.040
Please don't hurt me!
Please don't hurt me!

24:44.580 --> 24:46.750
- Go ahead.
- What?

24:46.750 --> 24:48.880
- Say what you want to say.

24:48.880 --> 24:50.670
- I'm just surprised,
that's all.

24:50.670 --> 24:52.460
You always drop in
on people like that?

24:52.460 --> 24:53.960
- I was not dropping in.

24:53.960 --> 24:55.920
I left something for her.
I was walking away.

24:55.920 --> 24:58.000
She came out.
We got to talking.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.500
- I get it, yeah.

24:59.500 --> 25:01.210
- So you think
I shouldn't have come.

25:01.210 --> 25:03.880
- Didn't say that.
- But...

25:03.880 --> 25:05.500
- You don't think
she might have felt

25:05.500 --> 25:07.460
a little invaded or angry
over that at all?

25:07.460 --> 25:09.040
- She wasn't supposed to see me.

25:09.040 --> 25:10.920
- Yeah, well,
you left something, A.

25:10.920 --> 25:13.250
And, B, she did see you, so...
- Okay. Well, I don't think

25:13.250 --> 25:15.120
that she would have invited me
in if she were angry.

25:15.120 --> 25:17.120
- I'm not talking about her
being angry with you, Jessie.

25:17.120 --> 25:18.830
I'm talking about her
being angry with me,

25:18.830 --> 25:21.380
for sharing her private business
with a complete stranger.

25:21.380 --> 25:24.620
- Well, I explained that
you didn't mean to tell me.

25:24.620 --> 25:26.210
And I'm sorry.

25:26.210 --> 25:27.880
- I don't understand
why you would reach out

25:27.880 --> 25:31.080
over something
that's so personal.

25:31.080 --> 25:34.000
- Because it's personal
to me too, Deacon.

25:34.000 --> 25:38.000
I've lost pregnancies
and I wanted her to know

25:38.000 --> 25:40.790
that someone out there
understood.

25:40.790 --> 25:43.120
- I'm sorry, Jessie.
I didn't...I'm sorry.

25:43.120 --> 25:45.960
- It's fine.
You didn't know.

25:45.960 --> 25:48.790
But I gotta go.
- Jessie...

25:48.790 --> 25:50.620
- You know, I had it in my head

25:50.620 --> 25:53.540
that you and I were
more than just strangers.

25:53.540 --> 25:55.670
I was starting to
think of you as a friend.

26:02.080 --> 26:04.040
- You know, I think
for all of us,

26:04.040 --> 26:05.830
we just wanted to have fun
with this new album.

26:05.830 --> 26:08.040
And get past all the pain
and celebrate.

26:08.040 --> 26:09.620
- Your evolution.
- Something like that.

26:09.620 --> 26:11.040
- Oh, my God.

26:11.040 --> 26:12.120
Are you the Man in Black
in the commercial?

26:12.120 --> 26:13.750
- That's me!

26:13.750 --> 26:14.830
- Oh, you and that dog
are so cute.

26:14.830 --> 26:16.460
- Well, the dog was cuter.

26:16.460 --> 26:18.460
- Well, that dog wouldn't
stop humping my leg.

26:18.460 --> 26:20.920
- Excuse me for a minute,
please.

26:22.710 --> 26:25.540
Travis! Hey!
What are you doing here?

26:25.540 --> 26:27.170
- Oh, the Beck show
finished early.

26:27.170 --> 26:28.750
And I just wanted to come
say thank you again.

26:28.750 --> 26:32.170
- Oh, that is so sweet!
I think you need a cocktail.

26:32.170 --> 26:33.880
They made a specialty
one tonight

26:33.880 --> 26:36.460
called Watermelon Rising.
How cute is that?

26:36.460 --> 26:37.960
And then we'll
catch up later, okay?

26:40.420 --> 26:44.080
Hey girl!
- Hey!

26:44.080 --> 26:45.500
Are you having fun?

26:45.500 --> 26:47.000
- Yeah, so much fun.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.120
- You feel all right?
- Yeah, why?

26:49.120 --> 26:50.960
- You look a little flushed.

26:50.960 --> 26:53.120
You don't have the thing that's
been going around, do you?

26:53.120 --> 26:54.620
- Oh, God, I hope not.

26:54.620 --> 26:56.670
- You feel a little warm to me.

26:56.670 --> 26:58.670
- Really?
- Yeah.

26:58.670 --> 27:00.880
Have you been getting
enough sleep?

27:00.880 --> 27:02.830
- Probably not.

27:02.830 --> 27:04.540
- You know what?

27:04.540 --> 27:06.960
I love that you have
come to support me.

27:06.960 --> 27:08.540
But you need
to take care of yourself,

27:08.540 --> 27:10.580
especially with everything
that you have coming up.

27:10.580 --> 27:12.830
Just go home and get some rest.
- Okay.

27:12.830 --> 27:14.750
Honestly, my feet have been
killing me anyways.

27:14.750 --> 27:16.380
- I feel you, girl.

27:16.380 --> 27:17.670
- Well, I love you.
- Love you.

27:17.670 --> 27:20.040
- Congratulations again.
- Thank you.

27:52.670 --> 27:54.290
(phone buzzes)

28:00.710 --> 28:02.380
- Thank you.

28:07.920 --> 28:10.420
- Maddie Jaymes?
Travis Stroud.

28:10.420 --> 28:12.750
- Hi. Oh, my gosh,
so nice to meet you.

28:12.750 --> 28:14.670
You have written some
of my favorite songs.

28:14.670 --> 28:16.290
- Well, as long as you keep
flattering me,

28:16.290 --> 28:18.790
I guess I can forgive you
for passing on this one.

28:18.790 --> 28:21.290
- Wait. Sorry. What?
- I'm kidding.

28:21.290 --> 28:23.960
J said it didn't
light your fire--I get it.

28:23.960 --> 28:26.330
I'd love to work with you
one of these days, though.

28:33.710 --> 28:36.040
- All right, squeeze in.

28:36.040 --> 28:37.500
Let someone with
longer arms do this.

28:37.500 --> 28:39.460
- How could you?
I knew something was off.

28:39.460 --> 28:42.000
And you convinced me
it was all in my head!

28:42.000 --> 28:43.580
Because you're
so preoccupied, right?

28:43.580 --> 28:44.790
- Maddie, please, can we just
talk about this outside?

28:44.790 --> 28:47.170
- No!

28:50.540 --> 28:52.500
There's nothing
to talk about, liar.

29:01.790 --> 29:03.380
- Hi.

29:03.380 --> 29:05.580
- Thought you needed
to be alone.

29:05.580 --> 29:09.120
- I did...I do,

29:09.120 --> 29:11.880
but I know you're hurting too,

29:11.880 --> 29:14.170
and you didn't answer phone,

29:14.170 --> 29:17.080
I just had to come
and see if you were okay.

29:17.080 --> 29:18.830
- Well, I'm not.

29:20.580 --> 29:23.670
All I want to do is
be there for you, Scarlett.

29:23.670 --> 29:27.210
But I can't even do that.
And I need to know why?

29:27.210 --> 29:29.960
Why won't you let me
take care of you?

29:29.960 --> 29:33.580
Let me in like you did before?

29:33.580 --> 29:35.290
- Gunnar...
- And it's my fault!

29:35.290 --> 29:37.620
How am I supposed to be okay
when it's my fault?

29:41.000 --> 29:43.710
- Hey, hey, Gunnar.

29:43.710 --> 29:47.580
Look at me.
You look at me.

29:47.580 --> 29:51.120
It was not your fault.
It was not.

29:51.120 --> 29:52.500
It just happened.

29:56.080 --> 29:59.540
- What about us?

29:59.540 --> 30:01.620
Not my fault,
but that just happened?

30:06.040 --> 30:09.620
- I know this has been
really hard on you.

30:09.620 --> 30:12.580
Being pregnant made me question
everything about my future.

30:12.580 --> 30:14.580
Suddenly I was thinking about

30:14.580 --> 30:17.960
spending the rest
of my life with you.

30:17.960 --> 30:21.830
And raising a family together.

30:21.830 --> 30:25.210
I was so scared of making
the wrong choice.

30:25.210 --> 30:28.080
- I'm scared too,

30:28.080 --> 30:31.250
but we can get
through this together.

30:31.250 --> 30:32.460
You're everything to me.

30:36.420 --> 30:38.210
- That's what makes it so hard.

30:41.500 --> 30:43.710
A lot of the time
it feels like

30:43.710 --> 30:47.120
I am the only thing
that keeps you happy.

30:47.120 --> 30:49.960
And then...

30:49.960 --> 30:51.540
I can't be what
you want me to be.

30:51.540 --> 30:53.080
And I make you miserable.

30:53.080 --> 30:55.460
And then I hate myself...
- Scarlett, you--

30:55.460 --> 30:58.750
- I know I can't carry
that weight anymore.

30:58.750 --> 31:01.960
I can barely carry myself.

31:01.960 --> 31:06.540
I hardly know which way is up,
let alone what I want.

31:06.540 --> 31:11.540
I can't let you wait around
while I figure it out 'cause...

31:11.540 --> 31:14.000
- It hurts too much.

31:20.290 --> 31:23.920
(cell phone rings)

31:26.880 --> 31:27.880
- Hey.

31:27.880 --> 31:29.540
- Hey, man.

31:29.540 --> 31:31.000
- Where are you now?

31:31.000 --> 31:33.500
- Uh, New Orleans.
It's been a blast.

31:33.500 --> 31:34.750
Heading to Texas.

31:34.750 --> 31:36.330
- Sounds great.

31:36.330 --> 31:39.120
- How's everything?
How's it going?

31:39.120 --> 31:41.460
- Sorry dude, Will asked
you to call, didn't he?

31:41.460 --> 31:44.830
- Well, he's worried about you.

31:44.830 --> 31:47.080
- Join the club.

31:47.080 --> 31:49.620
- Gunnar, come on, man.
What's going on?

31:49.620 --> 31:52.420
Talk to me.
- Where do I start?

31:52.420 --> 31:54.540
I haven't slept in three days.

31:54.540 --> 31:56.670
Scarlett and I
are taking some time.

31:56.670 --> 31:59.000
Whatever the hell that means.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.960
- Oh, man, I'm sorry.

32:00.960 --> 32:02.420
- I don't know. I just--

32:02.420 --> 32:03.420
I don't know what
to do with myself.

32:03.420 --> 32:06.210
I feel like I'm going crazy.

32:06.210 --> 32:07.960
- Come to Texas.

32:07.960 --> 32:09.880
- Shut up.
- No, I'm serious.

32:09.880 --> 32:11.250
You could play some
shows with us.

32:11.250 --> 32:13.460
Or just come along for the ride.

32:13.460 --> 32:15.170
Change of scenery
might do you good.

32:16.880 --> 32:19.040
- Oh, no, she didn't!

32:19.040 --> 32:21.040
Sparks and cocktails flew

32:21.040 --> 32:23.500
at Juliette Barnes' single
release event this weekend

32:23.500 --> 32:26.290
when up and comer Maddie Jaymes
attacked Barnes with a drink...

32:26.290 --> 32:28.040
- We have to address it.

32:28.040 --> 32:30.920
- And what, tell them that
I took the song for myself?

32:30.920 --> 32:33.790
That I'm a heartless...
bitch.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.540
But one thing is clear--
(TV turns off)

32:38.540 --> 32:40.580
- The good news is she hasn't
gone to the press yet.

32:40.580 --> 32:42.290
Nobody knows what
actually happened.

32:42.290 --> 32:44.620
So if you two can
bury the hatchet,

32:44.620 --> 32:45.830
maybe we can keep it that way.

32:51.620 --> 32:53.500
(knock on door)

32:53.500 --> 32:56.790
- It's open.

32:58.920 --> 33:02.290
- Figured I should come
and get some of my stuff.

33:02.290 --> 33:03.580
- Okay.

33:05.920 --> 33:09.210
I can not be here if you prefer.

33:09.210 --> 33:12.120
- You can be here.

33:12.120 --> 33:15.040
- Oh, I did want to ask you.

33:15.040 --> 33:18.120
I was thinking I might actually
would like to do the fundraiser.

33:18.120 --> 33:21.960
But I know we haven't talked
about how we're gonna do shows.

33:21.960 --> 33:23.380
And I didn't want you to feel
like you had to...

33:23.380 --> 33:25.420
- You should do it.

33:25.420 --> 33:28.460
- Without you?
Is that okay?

33:28.460 --> 33:30.210
- It's gonna have to be, yeah.
I'm going to Texas.

33:30.210 --> 33:32.420
- Texas?

33:32.420 --> 33:34.750
- I'm gonna join Avery
on the road.

33:34.750 --> 33:37.210
Got my own stuff to figure out.

33:37.210 --> 33:39.620
You know, you were right.

33:39.620 --> 33:42.670
I've been so wrapped up
in us for so long.

33:42.670 --> 33:44.420
I need to figure out who I am.

33:50.880 --> 33:52.420
- Hey.

34:07.420 --> 34:09.830
- Hey babe.
Is Maddie here?

34:09.830 --> 34:12.460
- Sorry.
She's not available right now.

34:12.460 --> 34:16.330
- I know she's angry.
And she has every right to be.

34:16.330 --> 34:19.170
I can't even explain why
I did what I did.

34:19.170 --> 34:23.040
When I heard that song,
I felt like it had to be mine.

34:23.040 --> 34:26.040
And Maddie already had a hit,
a big one.

34:26.040 --> 34:29.420
And I felt like that song
was my ticket back.

34:34.040 --> 34:38.000
I knew what I was doing,
and I did it anyway.

34:38.000 --> 34:41.170
There's no excuse.

34:41.170 --> 34:43.380
Just really sorry.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.120
- I'll give her the message.

34:47.120 --> 34:48.420
- Okay.

34:57.210 --> 34:58.460
- She seems like
she really means it.

35:14.080 --> 35:15.210
- You wanna tell me about it?

35:15.210 --> 35:17.170
- It was nothing.

35:17.170 --> 35:18.580
I was just upset
about something.

35:18.580 --> 35:20.670
- You must have
been pretty upset,

35:20.670 --> 35:22.290
because I don't recall
you ever throwing a drink

35:22.290 --> 35:25.080
in someone's face before.
- Dad, please.

35:25.080 --> 35:29.080
- Look, sweetheart, I know
how Juliette can get, all right?

35:31.170 --> 35:34.620
So just tell me what she did.

35:34.620 --> 35:36.120
- I really think
this is something

35:36.120 --> 35:37.620
I need to handle on my own.

35:40.250 --> 35:41.710
- Okay.

36:30.380 --> 36:33.040
- Hey.
- Hey.

36:33.040 --> 36:34.960
- Just so you know,
Scarlett invited me here.

36:34.960 --> 36:36.460
I'm not just dropping by.

36:36.460 --> 36:39.880
- Okay, yeah,
I deserve that. I do.

36:39.880 --> 36:40.920
I'm sorry, okay?

36:40.920 --> 36:42.460
- Forget about it, really.

36:42.460 --> 36:44.330
- No, I blew it
all out of proportion.

36:44.330 --> 36:46.000
You're there,
you're doing this nice thing,

36:46.000 --> 36:47.540
and I do that...
- It was too much.

36:47.540 --> 36:49.920
You confided in me
about your niece.

36:49.920 --> 36:52.290
And the next thing you know,
I'm bringing her tea.

36:52.290 --> 36:53.710
What kind of weirdo does that?

36:53.710 --> 36:56.120
- A kind weirdo?

36:56.120 --> 36:58.500
- I just think
I blurred the lines

36:58.500 --> 37:01.250
between professional
and personal.

37:01.250 --> 37:03.420
Which, you know, has worked out
great for me in the past.

37:03.420 --> 37:06.040
But, uh...
- It wasn't just you, Jessie.

37:06.040 --> 37:07.540
I shouldn't have said anything
about Scarlett or...

37:07.540 --> 37:10.000
- No, it was good that
it happened that way.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.170
Because it made me realize that

37:12.170 --> 37:14.750
I don't think I should
sign with Highway 65

37:14.750 --> 37:17.460
even if you wanted me to.

37:17.460 --> 37:20.250
Just wanting to keep
some work boundaries

37:20.250 --> 37:21.580
if that makes any sense.

37:21.580 --> 37:24.920
- I think so, yeah.

37:24.920 --> 37:26.880
Oh, here you are.
- Thank you.

37:26.880 --> 37:28.620
- Maddie? Daphne?
This is Jessie.

37:28.620 --> 37:30.080
- Hi.
- Hey.

37:30.080 --> 37:31.380
- She's an artist
that Zach and I

37:31.380 --> 37:34.420
have been talking with,
and a friend.

37:34.420 --> 37:36.380
- Awesome.
Nice to meet you.

37:36.380 --> 37:39.040
- Nice to meet you too.
I love your necklaces.

37:39.040 --> 37:40.960
- Thank you. I love yours.
- Thank you.

37:40.960 --> 37:42.710
- There's Scarlett.
Bye. It was nice to meet you.

37:42.710 --> 37:45.380
- Nice meeting you.

37:45.380 --> 37:47.750
They're lovely.
- Jessie!

37:47.750 --> 37:49.330
- Yeah, they are.
- Oh, I'm gonna go.

37:49.330 --> 37:51.290
- Yeah, sure, okay.
- A friend over there.

37:51.290 --> 37:53.710
- See you in a little bit.
- Talk to you later.

37:53.710 --> 37:56.120
- Oh, my God,
it's been so long.

37:56.120 --> 37:58.250
How are you?
How is the baby?

37:58.250 --> 38:03.120
- Um...

38:03.120 --> 38:06.620
- I got to tell
you guys something.

38:09.540 --> 38:11.750
- And now the moment
you've been waiting for.

38:11.750 --> 38:16.040
Put your hands together for
Scarlett O'Connor of The Exes!

38:23.120 --> 38:24.500
- Hello, everybody.

38:24.500 --> 38:26.790
Thank you so much
for coming tonight.

38:26.790 --> 38:28.330
It really does mean
a great deal to me.

38:28.330 --> 38:31.960
When I was in school,
we had a class

38:31.960 --> 38:33.920
about the birds and the bees.

38:33.920 --> 38:36.170
And basically the lesson
in that class

38:36.170 --> 38:38.580
was just don't do it.
(laughter)

38:38.580 --> 38:40.580
Nothing about when things got
more complicated.

38:40.580 --> 38:43.080
Because, of course,
birth control and STIs

38:43.080 --> 38:45.250
were just too taboo
to talk about.

38:45.250 --> 38:47.080
And that never set well with me,
which is how

38:47.080 --> 38:50.290
I ended up
in the principal's office.

38:50.290 --> 38:52.120
That kind of stigma
leaves us in the dark.

38:52.120 --> 38:55.830
Our medical needs
become this dirty secret.

38:55.830 --> 38:57.710
So when we need help,

38:57.710 --> 39:00.330
we often ourselves
struggling alone.

39:05.710 --> 39:07.790
But we're not alone.

39:07.790 --> 39:09.920
And that is why
it is so important

39:09.920 --> 39:14.210
to fight for our rights,
and to share our stories.

39:14.210 --> 39:16.710
Be a really scary feeling
to say out loud

39:16.710 --> 39:18.920
that I have an STI.

39:18.920 --> 39:21.500
Or I'm pregnant
and I don't know what to do.

39:21.500 --> 39:22.790
Or I had a miscarriage.

39:27.080 --> 39:31.120
I had a miscarriage
one week ago.

39:31.120 --> 39:34.040
So in a way, I am here
saying this for her,

39:34.040 --> 39:36.080
for my daughter,

39:36.080 --> 39:39.420
because I imagined
a future for her

39:39.420 --> 39:42.420
that was absolutely limitless.

39:42.420 --> 39:44.620
And the only way
we can get there

39:44.620 --> 39:48.750
is to strip away
the secrecy and the shame.

39:48.750 --> 39:50.500
Because that is
what makes us stronger.
