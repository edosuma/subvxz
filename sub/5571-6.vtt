WEBVTT

00:03.471 --> 00:06.171
WOMAN: Okay, okay.
How many ghosts do we have?

00:06.173 --> 00:09.174
(children laughing, shouting)

00:09.176 --> 00:12.678
WOMAN 2:
Simon says, "Touch your nose."

00:12.680 --> 00:15.280
Simon says, "Jump up and down."

00:15.282 --> 00:18.150
Simon says, "Jump up
and down and turn around."

00:18.152 --> 00:20.352
Simon says, "Stop."

00:21.689 --> 00:24.556
BOY:
I knew it was you.

00:24.558 --> 00:27.326
Hands where I can see them.

00:27.328 --> 00:31.263
I said reach for
the sky, partner.

00:31.265 --> 00:34.266
I'm afraid there's been some
sort of mistake, Sheriff.

00:34.268 --> 00:37.369
No mistake.
You're the ice cream bandit.

00:37.371 --> 00:39.538
Jackson Edward. Saddle up,
Sheriff. It's time to eat.

00:39.540 --> 00:41.340
Today's your lucky day.

00:41.342 --> 00:45.377
Now, don't let me catch you
in Dodge City again.

00:45.379 --> 00:48.414
(children's chatter continues)

00:52.253 --> 00:53.485
(gunshot)

00:53.487 --> 00:55.254
(children screaming)

01:28.789 --> 01:30.089
(bell dings)

01:34.128 --> 01:35.427
Hmm...

01:35.429 --> 01:37.763
You know, I've been
trying to get Christoph

01:37.765 --> 01:39.798
to name a burrito
after me for years.

01:39.800 --> 01:41.500
You're here a hot minute
and you already got one?

01:41.502 --> 01:43.402
I have a way
with people.

01:43.404 --> 01:44.470
I have noticed that.

01:44.472 --> 01:46.805
So, tell me--
what's in the "Bishop"?

01:46.807 --> 01:49.208
It's two tortillas
with eggs, steak,

01:49.210 --> 01:51.577
hash browns,
sweet potatoes, bacon,

01:51.579 --> 01:53.479
and four different cheeses.

01:53.481 --> 01:55.414
This is stress eating
of a new kind.

01:55.416 --> 01:57.249
You should be studied.

01:57.251 --> 01:58.550
What makes you
think I'm stressed?

01:58.552 --> 02:00.819
Oh, come on.
Bishop, you can't fool me.

02:00.821 --> 02:03.589
Jake's been away
on another one of these

02:03.591 --> 02:05.390
top-secret NSA assignments

02:05.392 --> 02:07.526
and you are a Type-A
control freak.

02:07.528 --> 02:10.229
And not knowing
is killing you.

02:10.231 --> 02:12.231
Not as much
as that burrito.

02:15.736 --> 02:18.203
DELILAH:
I don't think I'm being
unreasonable.

02:18.205 --> 02:19.905
McGEE:
That is not what I said.

02:19.907 --> 02:22.174
Oh, if it isn't
the nesting lovebirds.

02:22.176 --> 02:25.244
How goes the move-in
at Casa de McGee?

02:25.246 --> 02:27.146
Well, it would be better if
someone knew how to compromise.

02:27.148 --> 02:29.581
I got rid of some of my things,
like a grown-up.

02:29.583 --> 02:31.750
Oh, guess that answers
your question.

02:31.752 --> 02:34.653
Jake and I went through the same
thing when we moved in together.

02:34.655 --> 02:36.889
Consolidating two people's
lives into one space--

02:36.891 --> 02:38.891
it's, yeah, it's tricky.

02:38.893 --> 02:41.293
And just so you know, I donated
a bunch of my stuff last week.

02:41.295 --> 02:43.262
Stuff that was important to me.

02:43.264 --> 02:45.397
More important than my stuff?
Or more important than us?

02:45.399 --> 02:47.799
That's a trap.

02:47.801 --> 02:49.902
Sorry.
It's just a set up...

02:49.904 --> 02:53.405
Honey... 0-0-1-0-0.

02:55.843 --> 02:58.443
1-1-0-1-0-1.

02:58.445 --> 03:02.915
DELILAH:
0-1-0-1-1-1.

03:05.819 --> 03:08.921
0-0-1.

03:08.923 --> 03:11.356
Are they arguing in binary?

03:11.358 --> 03:13.492
Binary averages
12 digits per word.

03:13.494 --> 03:16.195
It's some sort of
modified shorthand.

03:16.197 --> 03:19.264
He can't even argue
like a cool cyborg.

03:19.266 --> 03:20.699
Grab your gear.

03:20.701 --> 03:22.568
We have a dead petty officer
in Fort Scott Park.

03:22.570 --> 03:25.704
Hey, Delilah.
How's the move?

03:25.706 --> 03:28.607
Still in progress, Agent Gibbs.

03:28.609 --> 03:30.242
GIBBS:
Gotta compromise, McGee.

03:30.244 --> 03:32.344
Working on it, Boss.

03:34.281 --> 03:35.447
(camera shutter clicking)

03:35.449 --> 03:36.982
GIBBS:
What do we know?

03:36.984 --> 03:40.219
The victim is Petty Officer
Second Class Adam Meyers,

03:40.221 --> 03:42.521
a culinary specialist
stationed at Norfolk.

03:42.523 --> 03:44.223
Cause of death, Duck?

03:44.225 --> 03:46.625
I'd say the gunshot wound to the
chest probably did the trick.

03:46.627 --> 03:48.427
It was
through-and-through.

03:48.429 --> 03:50.212
T.O.D.?

03:50.213 --> 03:51.996
I understand around
8:30 this morning.

03:51.999 --> 03:54.633
McGEE: Well, the witnesses
all heard one gunshot,

03:54.635 --> 03:56.535
but no one had eyes
on the shooter.

03:56.537 --> 04:00.272
All these people and no one
saw anyone fire a gun?

04:00.274 --> 04:02.274
Shooter was nowhere
near the victim.

04:02.276 --> 04:04.776
Had a higher vantage point...

04:04.778 --> 04:07.679
direct line of sight.

04:07.681 --> 04:11.383
So, long range-- must have
been a skilled sharpshooter.

04:11.385 --> 04:14.353
Tri-State Sniper, Boss.
Could be him.

04:14.355 --> 04:18.323
Find the nest.

04:18.325 --> 04:20.626
So, how do you know the victim,
Lieutenant Rossmore?

04:20.628 --> 04:22.561
Meyers and I served
together a few years back.

04:22.563 --> 04:24.363
You two were friends?
Not exactly.

04:24.365 --> 04:25.497
I was his department head.

04:25.499 --> 04:27.532
Before he called me
to meet up,

04:27.534 --> 04:29.701
I hadn't heard from Meyers
in over two years.

04:29.703 --> 04:31.703
I can't believe
this is happening.

04:31.705 --> 04:34.039
Oh, God, what about his sister?

04:34.041 --> 04:35.707
Farrah--
has anyone contacted her?

04:35.709 --> 04:36.675
We're taking care of that.

04:36.677 --> 04:38.410
(phone chimes)

04:38.412 --> 04:40.379
Uh, that's the ship.
I gotta get back.

04:40.381 --> 04:42.748
All right. Well, thanks
for your help, Lieutenant.

04:42.750 --> 04:45.284
You'll keep me
posted?
Sure thing.

04:51.592 --> 04:53.358
BISHOP:
Good spot to hide.

04:53.360 --> 04:55.327
Hikers don't
use the access road.

04:55.329 --> 04:58.330
This had to be it.

04:58.332 --> 05:00.299
Shooter had a clean shot
from this position.

05:00.301 --> 05:02.734
He gets low enough, the shrubs
would've provided cover.

05:02.736 --> 05:05.037
No wonder
no one saw him.

05:05.039 --> 05:07.606
Must've crawled
around here.

05:10.311 --> 05:13.312
Whoa, whoa. Bishop.
Stop! Don't move.

05:13.314 --> 05:15.814
What? What is it?
Poison oak.

05:15.816 --> 05:18.417
Where?
Uh... everywhere.

05:18.419 --> 05:19.484
Now, okay...

05:20.654 --> 05:23.021
Put these on, okay?

05:24.391 --> 05:26.325
After we're done here, we've
got to bag all of our clothes.

05:26.327 --> 05:27.710
Okay? Everything.

05:27.711 --> 05:29.094
There's this stuff
called urushiol,

05:29.096 --> 05:31.430
it's in the sap,
it spreads by contact.

05:31.432 --> 05:34.900
A what?
Uru... Just trust me, okay?

05:34.902 --> 05:37.102
Oh, all right.
Bad poison oak experience?

05:37.104 --> 05:38.704
Yeah, two of them,
thanks to Tony.

05:38.706 --> 05:40.038
If I get the trifecta,

05:40.040 --> 05:41.406
I'm never going
to hear the end of it.

05:41.408 --> 05:43.975
Hey, I got something.

05:45.679 --> 05:47.546
(camera shutter clicks)

05:49.883 --> 05:52.818
It's a shell casing.

05:52.820 --> 05:55.120
Hopefully Abby can
pull the fingerprints

05:55.122 --> 05:56.888
and we can identify
the shooter.

05:59.460 --> 06:01.393
I think we already did.

06:01.395 --> 06:03.628
Look at this.

06:05.499 --> 06:08.600
It's the mark
of the Tri-State Sniper.

06:08.602 --> 06:11.370
"Seven" for
the seventh victim.

06:11.372 --> 06:13.505
I think we're dealing
with a serial killer.

06:24.651 --> 06:26.068
(sighs)

06:26.069 --> 06:27.486
Did we really have
to throw out our clothes?

06:27.488 --> 06:28.787
Couldn't we just
wash them?

06:28.789 --> 06:30.155
Better safe
than sorry, okay?

06:30.157 --> 06:31.523
I don't want to go down

06:31.524 --> 06:32.890
that rash-riddled
rabbit hole again.

06:32.893 --> 06:34.526
(laughing):
Listen to the man, probie.

06:34.528 --> 06:35.927
If there's one thing
McGee knows about,

06:35.929 --> 06:37.696
it's embarrassing rashes.

06:37.698 --> 06:39.664
I'm not going through
that again.
Well, relax.

06:39.666 --> 06:41.666
I'm not going to give you
a hard time about that.

06:41.668 --> 06:45.704
I'm going to give you
a hard time about this.

06:45.706 --> 06:48.707
I found it under
McGee's desk.

06:48.709 --> 06:50.709
McGEE:
You realize
that's my private stuff.

06:50.711 --> 06:51.777
Well, what is it?

06:51.779 --> 06:53.111
This is the stuff McHoarder

06:53.113 --> 06:55.113
said he donated, but did not.

06:55.115 --> 06:56.848
You lied to Delilah?

06:56.850 --> 06:58.717
TONY (chuckling):
And I can see why.

06:58.719 --> 07:00.786
Now, judging by
the stash in here,

07:00.788 --> 07:04.122
it's very clear that this
is McGee's cry for help.

07:04.124 --> 07:05.791
I hear you crying, my friend.

07:05.793 --> 07:07.426
They're my childhood keepsakes.

07:07.428 --> 07:09.728
Yes.
Shows how old you are.

07:09.730 --> 07:12.464
'Cause you got Lincoln Logs
from, like, the '50s in here.

07:12.466 --> 07:14.699
And what else
do we have?

07:14.701 --> 07:16.735
We've got, um,
Commodore 64 disks.

07:16.737 --> 07:19.838
You see, Bishop, before...
Never mind.

07:19.840 --> 07:22.107
Oh, what do we
have here?

07:22.109 --> 07:24.476
An Easy-Bake Oven?

07:24.478 --> 07:26.645
I like the batter.

07:26.647 --> 07:28.947
(laughs):
And I think last,
but not least--

07:28.949 --> 07:32.818
the<i> piece de resistance--</i>

07:32.820 --> 07:34.553
this is a VHS tape, Bishop.

07:34.555 --> 07:38.723
And on it are dance recitals
from 1980 to '84.

07:38.725 --> 07:42.828
You have been saving your
sister's dance routines.

07:42.830 --> 07:43.995
That's a little creepy.

07:43.997 --> 07:45.897
Yeah, sorry,
I'm with Tony on that one.

07:45.899 --> 07:47.899
You're a few sewing
patterns away

07:47.901 --> 07:49.534
from Buffalo Bill,
you know what I mean?

07:49.536 --> 07:51.736
Let me explain to you
why that is not creepy.

07:51.738 --> 07:56.508
They're my recitals.
I used to tap dance, yeah.

07:56.510 --> 07:57.676
You heard me,
I used to tap dance.

07:57.678 --> 07:59.878
And you know what?
I was a natural.

07:59.880 --> 08:01.897
In fact, I was amazing.

08:01.898 --> 08:03.915
They used to call me Timmy
Soft Shoes Savant McGee.

08:03.917 --> 08:05.300
(laughs)
You understand?

08:05.301 --> 08:06.684
And I'm not ashamed of it, so...

08:06.687 --> 08:08.520
I gotta find a VHS player.

08:08.522 --> 08:10.956
GIBBS:
Update. Let's go.

08:13.894 --> 08:15.794
BISHOP:
Petty Officer Adam Meyers,

08:15.796 --> 08:17.896
24, from Baltimore,
Maryland.

08:17.898 --> 08:19.764
He grew up in-and-out
of foster care

08:19.766 --> 08:22.067
before joining the Navy
at the age of 18.

08:22.069 --> 08:23.068
Last six months,
he's been stationed

08:23.070 --> 08:25.604
at Flag Mess Hall
in Norfolk.

08:25.606 --> 08:26.938
His C.O. spoke
very highly of him.

08:26.940 --> 08:28.824
Next of kin?

08:28.825 --> 08:30.709
His younger sister, Farrah--
she's on her way up.

08:30.711 --> 08:32.711
Suspects. What do we know
about the Tri-State Sniper?

08:32.713 --> 08:35.714
TONY: His previous six victims
appear to be chosen at random.

08:35.716 --> 08:39.084
Men, women, different races,
between the ages of 21 and 65.

08:39.086 --> 08:42.988
Locations and times vary,
but his method stays the same.

08:42.990 --> 08:44.823
Single shot
to the chest.

08:44.825 --> 08:47.826
He also leaves behind a calling
card at each crime scene.

08:47.828 --> 08:49.761
Metro.
They were tight-lipped.

08:49.763 --> 08:50.896
Wouldn't reveal details
over the phone.

08:50.898 --> 08:52.230
Okay, get over there.

08:52.232 --> 08:53.832
I want a suspect list.

08:53.834 --> 08:54.933
Go.

08:54.935 --> 08:57.002
Hey, Timmy the Tapper.

08:58.739 --> 09:00.005
You go talk to the sister.
(cell phone rings)

09:00.007 --> 09:02.140
I was really good.

09:02.142 --> 09:03.308
Yeah, Duck.

09:03.310 --> 09:04.309
DUCKY:
Do you have a minute?

09:04.311 --> 09:05.877
Yep, on my way.

09:07.981 --> 09:11.316
The bullet pierced
the petty officer's aorta.

09:11.318 --> 09:12.984
Death was instantaneous.

09:12.986 --> 09:14.853
I knew that much
from the crime scene, Doc.

09:14.855 --> 09:17.372
Indeed.

09:17.373 --> 09:19.890
But you must allow me the
occasional, "I told you so."

09:19.893 --> 09:22.561
You got anything
else for me?

09:22.563 --> 09:24.896
Well, when I did
my examination,

09:24.898 --> 09:28.033
I noticed, uh, this
mandibular incisor

09:28.035 --> 09:29.868
had been recently
replaced.

09:29.870 --> 09:32.571
That along with this
corresponding laceration

09:32.573 --> 09:35.740
under his chin, the tooth
was dislodged, apparently,

09:35.742 --> 09:37.208
by a strike to the face.

09:37.210 --> 09:39.978
How recent?
According to his
dental records,

09:39.980 --> 09:41.913
he had an emergency
procedure.

09:41.915 --> 09:43.748
It was done three days ago.

09:43.750 --> 09:46.751
That's two attacks
within two days.

09:46.753 --> 09:49.220
Either this man
was very unlucky,

09:49.222 --> 09:51.723
or someone had
it in for him.

09:55.696 --> 09:57.696
No.

09:57.698 --> 10:00.765
No, I just talked
to my brother yesterday.

10:03.036 --> 10:05.236
No, it-it can't be him.

10:05.238 --> 10:08.006
I'm sorry for your loss,
Miss Meyers.

10:10.978 --> 10:13.044
Why would
someone do this?

10:14.214 --> 10:16.214
That's what we're
trying to find out.

10:16.216 --> 10:18.917
Do you know why your brother
was in the DC area?

10:18.919 --> 10:22.053
No, he said he was
visiting some Navy friend.

10:22.055 --> 10:24.990
I don't... I don't
know who, though.

10:24.992 --> 10:27.325
Oh, God, this can't
be happening.

10:27.327 --> 10:29.661
Is there someone
you want us to call?

10:32.199 --> 10:34.733
Adam was my only family.

10:34.735 --> 10:36.267
Obviously you two were close.

10:36.269 --> 10:39.938
Moving from one foster
home to another,

10:39.940 --> 10:42.374
we learned that we that we
could only count on each other.

10:44.077 --> 10:46.077
Now I've got no one.

10:46.079 --> 10:47.979
What am I supposed to do?

10:54.788 --> 10:56.254
What's up with you?

10:56.256 --> 10:57.922
You've been checking
your phone the entire time,

10:57.924 --> 10:59.891
like a teenage girl.

10:59.893 --> 11:01.893
Yeah, I'm texting
with Martinez at the NSA.

11:01.895 --> 11:04.863
There's been chatter about
an impending terror attack

11:04.865 --> 11:06.431
near where Jake is.

11:06.432 --> 11:07.998
I thought Jake couldn't tell you
where they were sending him?

11:08.001 --> 11:09.334
Well, he didn't.

11:09.336 --> 11:11.870
I spent years
at the NSA, Tony.

11:11.872 --> 11:13.872
I figured it out
on my own.

11:13.874 --> 11:15.340
So where is he?

11:15.342 --> 11:17.342
Can't tell you--
"need to know."

11:17.344 --> 11:18.743
Seriously.

11:18.745 --> 11:19.744
I'm Detective Campbell.

11:19.746 --> 11:21.079
You the two from NCIS?

11:21.081 --> 11:22.213
I'm DiNozzo,
she's Bishop.

11:22.215 --> 11:24.249
Sorry for being
cryptic on the phone.

11:24.250 --> 11:26.284
I couldn't officially comment
till after he was charged.

11:26.286 --> 11:27.819
After who was charged?

11:27.821 --> 11:29.087
The Tri-State Sniper.

11:29.089 --> 11:30.221
Caught the guy.

11:34.928 --> 11:36.928
CAMPBELL:
Franklin Reeves, a drifter.

11:36.930 --> 11:39.464
He was pulled over for having
a broken tail light.

11:39.466 --> 11:41.466
Statie ran the plates,
found it was stolen,

11:41.468 --> 11:43.134
and Reeves tried to flee.

11:43.136 --> 11:45.136
Found an M40 in his trunk.

11:45.138 --> 11:47.205
He was formally charged
ten minutes ago.

11:47.207 --> 11:48.306
And you're certain
he's the sniper?

11:48.308 --> 11:49.841
Got a full confession.

11:49.843 --> 11:51.843
Not to mention the
ballistics on his rifle

11:51.845 --> 11:52.977
are a match to the six victims.

11:52.979 --> 11:54.179
Might be seven.

11:54.181 --> 11:55.747
Excuse me?

11:55.749 --> 11:57.749
We believe your suspect
may be responsible

11:57.751 --> 12:00.185
for the death of Petty
Officer Adam Meyers.

12:00.187 --> 12:02.187
Took a round to the chest
at 0830 this morning.

12:02.189 --> 12:04.756
Where?
Fort Scott Park.

12:04.758 --> 12:08.760
But Reeves was pulled over
in Silver Spring at 0845,

12:08.762 --> 12:10.228
15 minutes later.

12:10.230 --> 12:12.297
That's a 30-minute drive--
how's that possible?

12:12.299 --> 12:14.065
Could it have
been a copycat?

12:15.869 --> 12:17.001
You want me to what?

12:17.003 --> 12:18.336
To pick one.

12:18.338 --> 12:20.004
One's a trick,
one's a treat.

12:20.006 --> 12:21.005
Abbs...

12:21.007 --> 12:22.006
Come on.

12:22.008 --> 12:23.408
My lab, my rules.

12:26.012 --> 12:27.479
(witch cackles)
ABBY: Treat.

12:27.481 --> 12:30.048
How anticlimactic.

12:30.050 --> 12:32.217
I'm still waiting
for the treat.
Wait no longer.

12:32.219 --> 12:36.087
All of the Tri-State Sniper's
victims were shot with an M40.

12:36.089 --> 12:40.191
Petty Officer Meyers was killed
with a round from an M16.

12:40.193 --> 12:43.194
And that's not all.

12:43.196 --> 12:45.363
The writing on the note that
was found at the crime scene

12:45.365 --> 12:47.365
is a match to the
note that Metro found

12:47.367 --> 12:48.533
on the sniper's
first victim.

12:51.772 --> 12:53.238
I'm not seeing anything.

12:53.240 --> 12:54.806
Exactly.

12:54.808 --> 12:57.041
It's too identical, Gibbs.

12:57.043 --> 12:59.477
The note found at the
crime scene is a trace.

12:59.479 --> 13:02.480
The sniper's note was
printed in every newspaper.

13:02.482 --> 13:04.149
Very easy to duplicate.

13:04.151 --> 13:06.317
Meyers was killed
by a copycat.
(cell phone rings)

13:06.319 --> 13:07.986
Yeah.

13:07.988 --> 13:09.120
It's Gibbs.

13:09.122 --> 13:11.122
Yeah. Yeah, I'm on my way.

13:11.124 --> 13:13.358
That's good work, Abbs.

13:13.360 --> 13:15.126
(witch cackles)

13:16.830 --> 13:18.329
(witch cackles)

13:18.331 --> 13:20.398
WITCH:
Run, run for your life.

13:22.135 --> 13:25.170
Gibbs, come on in.

13:25.172 --> 13:26.905
You remember
Special Agent Maureen Cabot.

13:26.907 --> 13:28.339
Hello, Mo.
Good to see you.

13:28.341 --> 13:30.008
Good to see you, Gibbs.

13:30.010 --> 13:32.143
Not many people manage to look
better after getting shot.

13:32.145 --> 13:33.344
Yeah, well, I wouldn't
recommend it.

13:33.346 --> 13:35.180
It's the suit--
threw me off too.

13:35.182 --> 13:36.181
Shall we?

13:36.183 --> 13:37.699
Yes, of course.

13:37.700 --> 13:39.216
I was just, uh, briefing
Director Vance

13:39.219 --> 13:42.220
on a case of mine that's
relevant to your investigation.

13:42.222 --> 13:43.889
Yeah? What
case is that?

13:43.890 --> 13:45.557
VANCE: The death of
former Ensign Ashley Ryan.

13:45.559 --> 13:47.158
She committed suicide
ten days ago.

13:49.029 --> 13:51.029
Why is the Sexual Violence
Unit involved?

13:51.031 --> 13:53.164
Well, her family
attributes her death

13:53.166 --> 13:55.099
to an incident
that occurred two years ago

13:55.101 --> 13:56.901
while she was deployed
on the USS Camden.

13:56.903 --> 13:59.237
A fellow sailor used
a hidden camera

13:59.239 --> 14:01.439
to take nude photos of her
and another female officer

14:01.441 --> 14:03.107
and post them online.

14:03.109 --> 14:05.009
Ryan never recovered from it.

14:05.011 --> 14:06.544
The sailor responsible
for the photos?

14:06.546 --> 14:08.613
That's the connection, Gibbs.

14:08.615 --> 14:10.882
CABOT:
Petty Officer Adam Meyers.

14:22.996 --> 14:24.796
That's affirmative,

14:24.797 --> 14:26.597
I was the commanding officer
of the USS<i> Camden</i>

14:26.600 --> 14:28.299
when the incident occurred
two years ago.

14:28.301 --> 14:29.634
VANCE:
And when did you become aware

14:29.636 --> 14:31.636
that there was a situation,
Captain Ebbakey?

14:31.638 --> 14:34.639
A crew member
discovered the photos

14:34.641 --> 14:37.976
of Ensign Ryan
and Lieutenant Gifford online

14:37.978 --> 14:39.477
and reported it.

14:39.479 --> 14:41.613
Uh, when did you notify NCIS?

14:41.615 --> 14:43.615
I contacted the Mayport
office immediately.

14:43.617 --> 14:47.218
Uh, they came aboard when we
pulled into port a week later.

14:47.220 --> 14:49.888
By then, Meyers had already
confessed to the crime.

14:49.890 --> 14:51.522
How's that?

14:51.524 --> 14:54.659
A matter as sensitive as this
required immediate action.

14:54.661 --> 14:57.595
During our transit,
I ordered an investigation,

14:57.597 --> 14:59.597
and within a few days,

14:59.599 --> 15:04.202
um, Meyers confided in his LPO,
who turned him in.

15:04.204 --> 15:06.070
Meyers wasn't discharged
from the Navy?

15:06.072 --> 15:09.407
No, his, uh, sentence
was decided by the judge

15:09.409 --> 15:11.542
who presided over
his court-martial.

15:11.544 --> 15:14.545
The penalty for violating
his fellow shipmates was

15:14.547 --> 15:16.681
simply three-months confinement
and a reduction in rank.

15:16.683 --> 15:19.517
As prescribed under the Uniform
Code of Military Justice.

15:19.519 --> 15:21.552
That doesn't make it
right, Captain.
EBBAKEY: I agree.

15:21.554 --> 15:25.123
So did the Navy, which is why
the UCMJ has since been amended.

15:25.125 --> 15:27.959
The LPO who turned Meyers in,
where is he now?

15:27.961 --> 15:29.961
That would be Petty Officer
First Class Peter Woodruff.

15:29.963 --> 15:31.296
He's a civilian now.

15:31.298 --> 15:35.466
He works, uh, for
an engineering firm in DC.

15:35.468 --> 15:37.602
All right, Woodruff's
secretary said
(cell phone beeps)

15:37.604 --> 15:39.470
he should still be
in the restaurant.

15:39.472 --> 15:40.605
Oh, you got
to be kidding me.

15:40.607 --> 15:42.607
Oh, what?

15:42.608 --> 15:44.608
Delilah making you give away
all your copies of<i> Deep Six?</i>

15:44.611 --> 15:46.144
No, she wants to get
rid of my couch.

15:46.146 --> 15:47.545
She says it's too dark
for the space.

15:47.547 --> 15:49.213
Well, maybe that's
'cause she knows

15:49.215 --> 15:50.615
that's where you slept with
Diane Sterling-Gibbs-Fornell.

15:50.617 --> 15:52.150
That did not happen, okay?

15:52.152 --> 15:53.284
(chuckles)

15:54.587 --> 15:55.720
There he is.

15:55.722 --> 15:58.022
Peter Woodruff, NCIS.

15:58.024 --> 15:59.557
Like to talk to you.

15:59.559 --> 16:00.692
USS Camden
investigation.

16:00.694 --> 16:02.727
Captain Ebbakey called.

16:02.729 --> 16:05.363
He ordered me to assist
in any way I could.
TONY: Ordered?

16:05.365 --> 16:06.397
You're a civilian now.

16:06.399 --> 16:09.067
Still respect
military tradition.

16:09.069 --> 16:10.535
So how can I help you?

16:10.537 --> 16:12.036
Did Petty Officer Meyers
confess to you

16:12.038 --> 16:13.271
that he planted
the hidden camera?

16:13.273 --> 16:14.605
That's correct.

16:14.607 --> 16:16.607
Um, I was Meyers'
career counselor.

16:16.609 --> 16:18.609
So he often came
to me for advice.

16:18.611 --> 16:20.611
When he told me that
he was the one responsible

16:20.613 --> 16:21.746
for posting those photos,

16:21.748 --> 16:24.349
I-I had no choice
but to turn him in.

16:24.351 --> 16:28.019
You still spoke on his behalf
at his disciplinary hearing.

16:28.021 --> 16:29.354
Uh, yes.

16:29.356 --> 16:32.357
Uh, what Meyers did was wrong,
plain and simple,

16:32.359 --> 16:34.726
but my job was to guide him,
not to judge him.

16:34.728 --> 16:36.728
I told him
to cooperate completely

16:36.730 --> 16:38.396
with the investigation,
which he did.

16:38.398 --> 16:39.731
Meyers made a statement,

16:39.733 --> 16:41.366
and then he turned over
the recording device.

16:41.368 --> 16:42.700
Hmm.

16:42.702 --> 16:44.769
So after his confession...

16:48.475 --> 16:50.608
...um, uh, when Meyers
was detained on board,

16:50.610 --> 16:52.377
did any of the crew
take issue with him?

16:52.379 --> 16:54.679
Yes, there was,
uh, a physical altercation

16:54.681 --> 16:57.181
between Meyers and one
of the victims of the photos.

16:57.183 --> 16:58.449
Ashley Ryan?

16:58.451 --> 17:00.451
No, Lieutenant Kara Gifford.

17:00.453 --> 17:02.787
She attacked him.

17:02.789 --> 17:04.689
Probably would have killed him
if I hadn't intervened.

17:09.029 --> 17:10.361
Give me a break.

17:10.363 --> 17:11.696
It was just a broken nose.

17:11.698 --> 17:13.598
I could have done much worse.

17:13.600 --> 17:14.599
Word is-- you tried to.

17:14.601 --> 17:17.735
Bones heal, Agent Gibbs.

17:17.737 --> 17:20.738
It's nothing compared to what
Meyers did to me and Ashley.

17:20.740 --> 17:22.740
No one seemed to care then.

17:22.742 --> 17:24.409
Who'd he violate this time?

17:24.411 --> 17:26.077
No one.

17:26.079 --> 17:27.478
He's dead.

17:27.480 --> 17:29.080
Meyers was shot and killed.

17:32.485 --> 17:34.152
Guess karma caught up
with him.

17:34.154 --> 17:36.154
Oh, karma didn't have
anything to do with it.

17:36.156 --> 17:39.157
Sharpshooter with an M16.

17:39.159 --> 17:41.159
You know anybody
that fits that description?

17:41.161 --> 17:43.094
I don't, but I'd like
to thank them.

17:43.096 --> 17:45.180
You know why we're here,
Lieutenant.

17:45.181 --> 17:47.265
When was the last time you had
any contact with Meyers?

17:49.235 --> 17:50.701
Two years ago.

17:50.703 --> 17:52.770
When he was escorted
off the ship.

17:52.772 --> 17:54.672
You wanted him dead.

17:54.673 --> 17:56.573
Yeah, of course I did,
but did I do it?

17:56.576 --> 17:58.576
No.

17:58.578 --> 18:00.711
And I'm not gonna lose any sleep
over his death either.

18:00.713 --> 18:03.648
Ashley's gone because
of what he did.

18:03.650 --> 18:05.083
Her family says
you two were close.

18:05.085 --> 18:08.119
We went through
the same hell together.

18:08.121 --> 18:11.122
Ashley and I spent the last
two years filing injunctions

18:11.124 --> 18:13.091
to try and get those
images off the Internet.

18:13.093 --> 18:16.094
But it never did any good.

18:16.096 --> 18:18.763
They're always going
to be out there.

18:18.765 --> 18:20.298
Forever.

18:20.300 --> 18:24.836
The humiliation
and harassment...

18:27.474 --> 18:29.474
...Ashley couldn't
handle it anymore.

18:29.476 --> 18:31.476
And she shouldn't
have had to, Kara.

18:31.478 --> 18:32.610
Let us help you.

18:32.612 --> 18:33.711
It's a little late for that.

18:33.713 --> 18:35.646
Are we done here?

18:35.648 --> 18:36.781
I have to get back to work.

18:36.783 --> 18:38.850
Thank you,
Lieutenant.

18:40.753 --> 18:41.819
Well, she's hiding something.

18:41.821 --> 18:43.721
Oh yeah, absolutely.

18:43.723 --> 18:46.624
BISHOP:<i> So much for your</i>
<i> day off, Delilah.</i>

18:46.626 --> 18:49.360
Call from Abby, and you're
back working cybercrime.

18:49.362 --> 18:50.828
A welcomed distraction.

18:50.830 --> 18:53.531
This trumps unpacking
moving boxes any day.

18:53.533 --> 18:54.866
Can we just acknowledge

18:54.868 --> 18:57.201
the brain power
in this room right now?

18:57.203 --> 19:01.205
We have a forensic
cyber specialist.

19:01.207 --> 19:03.207
A cyber terrorist hunter.

19:03.209 --> 19:05.877
And a cyber spy.

19:05.879 --> 19:08.579
For the last time,
I wasn't a spy.

19:08.581 --> 19:10.882
We're the cyber dream team.

19:10.884 --> 19:11.782
Sounds official.

19:11.784 --> 19:13.351
Do we get jerseys?

19:13.352 --> 19:14.919
Ooh, or secret matching
decoder rings.

19:14.921 --> 19:17.488
Yes, I love where this is going.
(computer beeps)

19:17.490 --> 19:20.158
Okay, fingerprint analysis.

19:20.160 --> 19:22.560
Well, Petty Officer
Meyers' prints

19:22.562 --> 19:25.229
were all over the camera
hidden aboard the Camden.

19:25.231 --> 19:25.897
Huh.

19:25.899 --> 19:27.298
This is
interesting.

19:27.300 --> 19:29.300
The camera was purchased
three years ago

19:29.302 --> 19:31.169
and registered for
an extended warranty.

19:31.171 --> 19:33.804
Buyer's name is listed
as Howard Falconio.

19:33.806 --> 19:34.805
How'd Meyers get it?

19:34.807 --> 19:36.674
I'll find out.

19:36.676 --> 19:39.343
Hey, any luck tracking where the
photos online originated from?

19:39.345 --> 19:41.679
The good news is I found
the e-mail address

19:41.681 --> 19:42.947
that uploaded
the images.

19:42.949 --> 19:44.248
And the bad news is...?

19:44.250 --> 19:45.583
Dummy account.

19:45.585 --> 19:47.418
Meyers was more tech-savvy
than we thought.

19:47.420 --> 19:50.421
Except he wasn't.

19:50.423 --> 19:52.790
Meyers was still using
a flip phone.

19:52.792 --> 19:55.493
His PC was running
on Windows 98.

19:55.495 --> 19:57.695
Tech-savvy people like
tech-savvy gear.

19:57.697 --> 19:59.764
ABBY:
That's weird.

19:59.765 --> 20:01.832
It's like he's Gibbs by day
and McGee by night.

20:01.834 --> 20:03.801
Meyers' Internet search
history is even stranger.

20:03.803 --> 20:05.770
He didn't visit a
single dirty site.

20:05.772 --> 20:07.772
Nothing even close
to being risqué.

20:07.774 --> 20:09.540
Unusual for someone who's
a self-confessed voyeur.

20:09.542 --> 20:10.541
(cell phone chimes)

20:10.543 --> 20:12.243
That's me.
(chuckles)

20:14.847 --> 20:16.914
Oh, my God.

20:18.952 --> 20:20.618
REPORTER:
If you're just joining us,

20:20.620 --> 20:23.221
we have breaking news
out of Dubai.

20:23.223 --> 20:25.556
Early this morning in the
downtown business district,

20:25.558 --> 20:26.891
two explosive devices...

20:26.893 --> 20:27.892
Give me a sitrep.

20:27.894 --> 20:29.560
Terror attack in Dubai.

20:29.562 --> 20:32.230
Two bombs detonated
inside the Monroe Hotel.

20:32.232 --> 20:34.298
Al Shabaab claimed
responsibility.

20:34.300 --> 20:36.000
How many people inside?
Over 500.

20:36.002 --> 20:37.535
There was chatter.

20:37.537 --> 20:38.903
Why didn't they
change the venue?

20:38.905 --> 20:40.504
"They"?

20:40.506 --> 20:41.872
NSA.

20:43.876 --> 20:45.409
Jake was inside that hotel.

20:45.411 --> 20:47.778
I haven't been able
to make contact with him.

20:47.780 --> 20:49.914
Over 20 employees were sent
there for a conference.

20:49.916 --> 20:51.449
NSA's scrambling.

20:51.451 --> 20:52.650
Bishop, go home.

20:52.652 --> 20:53.651
Wait for word.

20:53.653 --> 20:54.652
No, I can do
more from MTAC.

20:54.654 --> 20:55.653
Bishop.
Gibbs.

20:55.655 --> 20:57.288
I'm not gonna wait around

20:57.290 --> 20:59.290
for a "we regret
to inform you" call.

20:59.292 --> 21:02.393
I'm not leaving here
until I find Jake.

21:17.543 --> 21:21.012
Okay, I understand,
but what<i> can</i> you tell me?

21:21.014 --> 21:22.546
Okay, got it, "need to know."

21:22.548 --> 21:24.265
Thank you.

21:24.266 --> 21:25.983
What, NSA wouldn't give
you anything on Jake?
Nothing.

21:25.985 --> 21:28.519
So much for intel sharing.
How can I help?

21:28.521 --> 21:30.021
Well, we need eyes
on the ground.

21:30.023 --> 21:31.589
Do-do you still have contacts
from when you worked in Dubai?

21:31.591 --> 21:32.923
A few, yeah.
I'll make some calls.

21:32.925 --> 21:33.991
Wait, Delilah...

21:34.961 --> 21:38.396
Um...

21:38.398 --> 21:40.531
I think you were right.

21:41.067 --> 21:42.066
About the couch.

21:42.068 --> 21:44.969
It doesn't fit the space.

21:44.971 --> 21:46.637
I think I was
too quick to judge.

21:46.639 --> 21:48.339
It's growing on me.

21:48.341 --> 21:50.608
Tim.

21:50.610 --> 21:53.344
Big or small,
we'll face it together, okay?

21:53.346 --> 21:54.445
TONY:
Hey, McGee.

21:54.447 --> 21:56.447
I got your message.

21:56.449 --> 21:57.782
Hi, Delilah.

21:57.784 --> 21:59.350
Any word on Jake?

21:59.352 --> 22:00.651
Nothing yet.
Where you been?

22:00.653 --> 22:02.653
I've been canvassing
Meyer's neighborhood,

22:02.655 --> 22:04.322
and I spoke to...

22:04.324 --> 22:07.391
Ooh, God, it's killing me.

22:07.393 --> 22:08.793
What's with him?

22:08.795 --> 22:11.028
It's the last time
I let my dad iron my shirts.

22:11.030 --> 22:12.697
I'm telling you,
the man uses too much starch.

22:12.699 --> 22:14.632
What does he think
this is, a potato?

22:14.634 --> 22:16.100
For God's sakes.

22:16.101 --> 22:17.567
"You know, Junior, the only
thing more important

22:17.570 --> 22:19.970
than a stiff drink
is a stiff collar."

22:19.972 --> 22:21.639
That guy.

22:21.641 --> 22:23.040
Can't breathe in this.

22:24.711 --> 22:25.810
Tony...

22:25.812 --> 22:26.911
That's better.

22:26.913 --> 22:27.912
...the case.

22:27.914 --> 22:29.580
The case, yes.

22:29.582 --> 22:31.716
Well, two days before
Meyers was shot,

22:31.718 --> 22:34.385
his neighbor witnessed
a heated argument

22:34.387 --> 22:36.387
between Meyers and a woman
outside his apartment.

22:36.389 --> 22:39.390
The woman threw
a mean left hook at Meyers

22:39.392 --> 22:40.791
before threatening to kill him.

22:40.793 --> 22:42.126
Explains Meyers'
busted tooth.

22:42.128 --> 22:43.060
Yes, it would.

22:43.062 --> 22:44.428
It gets better.

22:44.430 --> 22:47.098
The neighbor got
Pacquiao's license plate.

22:47.100 --> 22:51.635
And our mystery woman
is Lieutenant Kara Gifford.

22:53.039 --> 22:54.705
CABOT:
<i> We know you saw Meyers.</i>

22:54.707 --> 22:57.675
An eyewitness put you at his
apartment three days ago.

22:57.677 --> 23:00.444
We can't help you if
you keep lying to us.

23:00.446 --> 23:02.880
I don't get the feeling
that you're here to help me.

23:02.882 --> 23:06.751
If we weren't, you would be in
an interrogation room right now.

23:06.753 --> 23:10.554
Look, we're both on your side.

23:12.859 --> 23:14.458
You want to keep it that way?

23:15.995 --> 23:17.795
I suggest you start talking.

23:26.406 --> 23:29.473
Meyers showed up to
Ashley's funeral last week.

23:31.611 --> 23:32.910
Why would he go there?

23:34.714 --> 23:36.714
I wondered the
same thing.

23:36.716 --> 23:39.650
The more I thought about it,
the angrier I got.

23:41.554 --> 23:44.889
I tracked him down
and confronted him.

23:44.891 --> 23:47.892
I wanted to hear him acknowledge

23:47.894 --> 23:49.894
what he was responsible for.

23:49.896 --> 23:50.895
Did he?

23:50.897 --> 23:52.897
(scoffs)

23:52.899 --> 23:55.032
He started crying.

23:55.034 --> 23:58.903
Said he... promised
to make things right.

24:00.440 --> 24:02.506
Things can't ever be made right.

24:05.678 --> 24:06.877
That's when you hit him.

24:11.851 --> 24:15.719
I thought it would
make me feel better.

24:15.721 --> 24:17.788
But it didn't.

24:19.859 --> 24:21.525
After that I left.

24:21.527 --> 24:23.994
Meyers was a little bloody,
but very much alive.

24:23.996 --> 24:25.896
Why didn't you tell
us this before?

24:25.898 --> 24:28.766
I knew how bad it looked.

24:28.768 --> 24:31.902
Threatening him days before
he turned up dead?

24:31.904 --> 24:34.839
And if the Navy found out,
they'd give me a dishonorable.

24:34.841 --> 24:36.941
I was scared.

24:40.513 --> 24:43.581
He took so much from me already.

24:46.519 --> 24:49.053
I didn't want my career
to be another casualty.

24:53.793 --> 24:56.260
NEWS ANCHOR: Coming to you
live from the central...

24:56.262 --> 24:59.497
Hey, what's the latest?

24:59.499 --> 25:01.499
News outlets are
reporting 30 casualties,

25:01.501 --> 25:03.634
but my intel puts
the number at 43.

25:03.636 --> 25:05.102
And hundreds more injured.

25:05.104 --> 25:06.170
Anything from the NSA?

25:06.172 --> 25:08.172
Two analysts are confirmed dead.

25:08.174 --> 25:11.242
Jake and five others
are still unaccounted for.

25:11.244 --> 25:13.911
You know, the-the comms
are probably down.

25:13.913 --> 25:15.679
I'm sure Jake's fine,
he's probably...

25:15.681 --> 25:18.983
If you want to help me, McGee,
spare me the false hope.

25:18.985 --> 25:22.920
What I need are the
facts, and that's it.

25:24.991 --> 25:26.924
Okay.

25:33.299 --> 25:35.299
You know, when people say

25:35.301 --> 25:37.301
that they know what
you're going through,

25:37.303 --> 25:39.003
they usually don't.

25:39.005 --> 25:40.871
They just say it to comfort you.

25:40.873 --> 25:42.573
But in this case,

25:42.575 --> 25:45.042
I actually know exactly
what you're going through.

25:45.044 --> 25:47.044
I was there.

25:47.046 --> 25:48.579
Two years ago.

25:48.581 --> 25:49.914
Benham Parsa.

25:51.617 --> 25:54.084
His drone attack on the gala.

25:54.086 --> 25:58.088
After that explosion, um...

25:58.090 --> 25:59.957
I couldn't find Delilah.

25:59.959 --> 26:03.093
I didn't know...
if she was hurt.

26:03.095 --> 26:05.296
I didn't even know
if she was alive.

26:05.298 --> 26:09.967
And each second feels
like an hour.

26:09.969 --> 26:13.971
And the worry
turns to anger.

26:13.973 --> 26:15.973
Mostly at yourself,

26:15.975 --> 26:18.042
because you know there was
nothing you could do.

26:20.980 --> 26:23.847
But I remember--

26:23.849 --> 26:27.985
no matter how much
I pushed everyone away,

26:27.987 --> 26:30.988
you were all there.

26:30.990 --> 26:33.057
And that's what
family does, Bishop.

26:35.061 --> 26:38.062
So...

26:38.064 --> 26:41.065
whether you think
you need us or not...

26:42.702 --> 26:44.768
...we're not going anywhere.

27:02.021 --> 27:04.221
Zero, zero, one, one, zero.

27:08.928 --> 27:10.995
You're welcome.

27:21.273 --> 27:24.274
Gibbs.

27:24.276 --> 27:25.976
Special Agent Cabot.

27:25.978 --> 27:26.977
Check it out.

27:26.979 --> 27:30.080
Riveting, Abbs?

27:30.082 --> 27:32.049
You know I only metalwork
on very special occasions.

27:32.051 --> 27:34.051
It's a hollowed-out nickel?
Mm-hmm.

27:34.053 --> 27:36.120
And I'm gonna make it
into a ring, three of 'em.

27:36.122 --> 27:37.988
One for each member
of the dream team.

27:37.990 --> 27:40.324
Not a lot of people know
that coins...

27:40.326 --> 27:42.660
Abby.

27:42.662 --> 27:43.661
Sorry.

27:43.663 --> 27:45.663
Ever since you've had me combing

27:45.665 --> 27:47.665
through Petty Officer Meyers'
financial records,

27:47.667 --> 27:49.199
I have money on the brain.

27:49.201 --> 27:51.435
Did something flag?
Big time.

27:51.437 --> 27:56.073
So Meyers had a joint
account with his sister.

27:56.075 --> 27:58.976
Every month, same
deposits, same expenses.

27:58.978 --> 28:01.845
Until September 18, 2013.
(witch cackles)

28:01.847 --> 28:06.016
There was $15,000
deposited into the account.

28:06.018 --> 28:08.218
That's the day after the
Camden came back into port,

28:08.220 --> 28:09.887
when Meyers was taken
into custody.

28:09.889 --> 28:11.889
What happened to the money?

28:11.891 --> 28:13.157
Three days later,
the money was wired

28:13.159 --> 28:15.159
to a law firm called
Whitford and Roe.

28:15.161 --> 28:17.061
They're, like, bigwigs
out of Norfolk.

28:17.063 --> 28:19.063
I thought Meyers had
a JAG attorney handle his case.

28:19.065 --> 28:21.699
He did.
(phone ringing)

28:21.701 --> 28:23.033
Yeah, it's Gibbs.

28:23.035 --> 28:25.402
Duck.

28:25.404 --> 28:27.471
DiNozzo what?!

28:29.008 --> 28:32.342
TONY:
So, on a scale of one
to ten, how bad is it?

28:32.344 --> 28:35.145
Let's just say,
the scale needs recalibrating.

28:35.147 --> 28:37.948
I'm afraid it is

28:37.950 --> 28:40.117
toxicodendron pubescens,

28:40.119 --> 28:42.453
otherwise known
as eastern poison oak.

28:42.455 --> 28:46.190
The symptoms are itching,
inflammation, blistering...

28:46.192 --> 28:47.791
My skin

28:47.793 --> 28:49.893
feels like the surface
of 10,000 suns.

28:49.895 --> 28:51.128
DUCKY:
Yes, and

28:51.130 --> 28:53.797
a propensity for the dramatic.

28:53.799 --> 28:55.999
Tony, you are so right.

28:56.001 --> 28:58.302
This is so much more fun when
you're on the other side of it.

28:58.304 --> 28:59.770
(Tony laughs,
elevator bell dings)

28:59.772 --> 29:01.489
Well, you keep laughing, McGee,

29:01.490 --> 29:03.207
and I'm gonna rub myself
over everything you own.

29:03.209 --> 29:04.908
Ah, geez.
TONY:
Sorry, boss.

29:04.910 --> 29:06.810
Still think
I don't want to be here?
I wish you weren't,

29:06.812 --> 29:08.212
looking like that.
McGEE:
Looks like Tony got

29:08.214 --> 29:10.047
poison oak from the crime scene.

29:10.049 --> 29:11.348
Sniper's nest was covered in it.

29:11.350 --> 29:14.017
If your killer was as unaware

29:14.019 --> 29:16.854
of the plant's presence
as Anthony here,

29:16.856 --> 29:18.155
he may be infected, too.

29:18.157 --> 29:21.191
And with a strain
as virulent as this,

29:21.193 --> 29:23.227
oh, he'd need
to seek medical help.

29:23.229 --> 29:24.428
I was just interviewing
the witnesses.

29:24.430 --> 29:26.296
I didn't go anywhere
near the sniper's nest.

29:26.298 --> 29:27.931
Sap could've spread
from their clothing.

29:27.933 --> 29:29.366
Did you touch anyone
at the crime scene?

29:29.368 --> 29:31.101
Oh, I...

29:32.104 --> 29:33.504
Nick Rossmore.

29:33.506 --> 29:35.305
I shook his hand.

29:35.307 --> 29:39.143
Rossmore was Meyers' department
head on the USS<i> Camden.</i>

29:39.145 --> 29:41.078
Bring him in.
With pleasure.

29:48.487 --> 29:50.888
Finally!

29:50.890 --> 29:53.791
Can someone tell me
what is going on here?

29:55.060 --> 29:58.262
Does this clear things up
for you a little?

29:58.264 --> 29:59.930
Oh, boy.

30:01.901 --> 30:03.967
You recognize them?

30:03.969 --> 30:05.269
No.

30:05.271 --> 30:07.037
Should I?
TONY:
I guess it looks

30:07.039 --> 30:08.572
different through the scope
of an M16.

30:08.574 --> 30:10.274
Why don't you help him out,
McGee?

30:10.276 --> 30:12.276
It's your sniper's nest
at Fort Scott Park.

30:12.278 --> 30:14.278
where you shot
Petty Officer Meyers.

30:14.280 --> 30:16.146
Where I<i> what?!</i>

30:16.148 --> 30:17.915
Are you insane?
TONY:
Well, I can't speak for Tim,

30:17.917 --> 30:20.117
but, uh, me, no.

30:20.119 --> 30:24.121
I'm itchy, I'm irritated,
and I have a gun.

30:24.123 --> 30:25.255
Where'd you get the poison oak?

30:25.257 --> 30:26.857
I cut across a hiking trail

30:26.859 --> 30:28.325
on my way to meet Meyers.

30:28.327 --> 30:29.927
The path was covered in it.

30:29.929 --> 30:31.461
Is this the same meeting
where he ended up dead?

30:31.463 --> 30:33.964
I had nothing to do with it!

30:33.966 --> 30:37.267
Meyers was shot by
the Tri-State Sniper.

30:39.138 --> 30:41.138
Wasn't he?

30:41.140 --> 30:44.208
No, someone staged it
to look like that.

30:44.210 --> 30:47.377
Would you have any idea
who would want him dead?

30:49.281 --> 30:51.381
Oh, my God.

30:53.619 --> 30:56.353
I would have said
something before, but...

30:56.355 --> 30:58.288
I thought
that the sniper was responsible,

30:58.290 --> 31:00.390
so I didn't think
that it was relevant.

31:00.392 --> 31:02.226
What wasn't relevant?

31:02.228 --> 31:05.295
When we went on deployment
two years ago, Meyers' got word

31:05.297 --> 31:08.899
that his sister had been
arrested for possession.

31:08.901 --> 31:12.569
He was beside himself at the
thought of her going to prison.

31:12.571 --> 31:15.339
And he told me
that he was going to find a way

31:15.341 --> 31:17.875
to pay for a top-notch lawyer.

31:17.877 --> 31:19.176
A couple days later,
he confesses

31:19.178 --> 31:21.211
to planting
a hidden camera onboard.

31:21.213 --> 31:23.113
It didn't make any sense.

31:23.115 --> 31:25.182
Meyers was not
that kind of a person.

31:25.184 --> 31:28.352
And I... I always thought
that he took the fall.

31:28.354 --> 31:31.889
Who was he covering for?
I don't know, but Ashley's
death-- it changed things.

31:31.891 --> 31:33.657
He told me that her family

31:33.659 --> 31:35.359
deserved to know the truth.

31:35.361 --> 31:37.261
And I think
that he was planning

31:37.263 --> 31:39.329
on coming clean with everything.

31:39.331 --> 31:42.966
Somebody got to him first.

31:53.679 --> 31:55.445
I had my contacts in Dubai
send me everything

31:55.447 --> 31:57.281
they could get
their hands on.

31:57.282 --> 31:59.116
From inside the hotel
to a five-block radius.

31:59.118 --> 32:01.385
Didn't want to
limit our options.

32:01.387 --> 32:04.354
It's a lot more ground to cover,
but we'll find something.

32:04.356 --> 32:06.256
Macaroon.

32:06.258 --> 32:08.158
Is that code for something?

32:08.160 --> 32:12.162
Oh, uh, it's this...
silly tradition

32:12.164 --> 32:15.332
Jake and I have whenever
one of us goes out of town.

32:15.334 --> 32:17.234
It's sort of
our own good-bye.

32:17.236 --> 32:21.004
We walk to the front door,
and we kiss,

32:21.006 --> 32:23.140
and he says,

32:23.142 --> 32:25.142
"Bye-bye, Pumpkin Pie,"

32:25.144 --> 32:27.511
and I say,
"See you soon, Macaroon."

32:27.513 --> 32:29.413
Two food references.

32:29.415 --> 32:31.949
Sounds about right.

32:38.290 --> 32:42.192
I'm the one who's supposed to be
in that position, not Jake.

32:42.194 --> 32:43.560
What position?

32:43.562 --> 32:45.595
The one in harm's way.

32:45.597 --> 32:48.031
I finally understand

32:48.033 --> 32:50.133
what Jake's been talking
about all this time.

32:50.135 --> 32:52.436
My NSA deployments
in the Middle East,

32:52.438 --> 32:55.439
these past few years at NCIS.

32:55.441 --> 32:57.174
This is what
he's been going through.

32:57.176 --> 32:59.343
It has nothing
to do with your job, Bishop.

32:59.345 --> 33:02.579
Even if you were a librarian,
the worry wouldn't go away.

33:02.581 --> 33:04.614
Everyone's greatest

33:04.616 --> 33:08.418
fear is losing
the one they love the most.

33:08.420 --> 33:10.587
That's why we fight like hell
for every minute.

33:10.589 --> 33:13.056
(keyboard keys clicking,
computer chirping)

33:13.058 --> 33:15.125
Wait. Go back one.

33:15.127 --> 33:17.294
MAN:
Yes, ma'am.
There.

33:17.296 --> 33:19.262
That's the hotel
in the background.
The taxi stand. Zoom in.

33:20.232 --> 33:22.766
I think that's Jake.

33:22.768 --> 33:26.636
Taxi's registration-- XZ017.

33:26.638 --> 33:30.474
Okay, we can check the
driver's passenger cam footage.

33:30.476 --> 33:33.010
(computer trilling)
All right, I'm in.

33:33.012 --> 33:35.212
No. No.

33:35.214 --> 33:37.314
(computer trilling)

33:37.316 --> 33:39.249
No.

33:39.251 --> 33:40.717
That's him. Bishop.

33:40.719 --> 33:42.552
What's the timestamp?

33:42.554 --> 33:45.422
Driver logged
his ride from...

33:45.424 --> 33:48.492
0713 to 0735.

33:49.428 --> 33:51.395
Bombs went off at 0720.

33:51.397 --> 33:54.231
When Jake was across town.
Wasn't in the building.

33:55.467 --> 33:57.534
He's alive.

34:00.339 --> 34:03.073
GIBBS:
I already read
Meyers' file, Duck.

34:03.075 --> 34:05.075
Then you know that
from an early age,

34:05.077 --> 34:08.445
the only constant in
his life was his sister.

34:08.447 --> 34:11.715
Everything he did was driven
by a need to protect her.

34:11.717 --> 34:14.718
Yeah, he had a classic

34:14.720 --> 34:17.587
hero complex, but

34:17.589 --> 34:20.457
ruled by
selfless motives.

34:20.459 --> 34:22.793
Unlike the perpetrator
responsible

34:22.795 --> 34:25.429
for planting this hidden camera.

34:25.431 --> 34:28.365
I believe your suspicions
are correct.
Yeah?

34:29.301 --> 34:31.201
Meyers was innocent?

34:31.203 --> 34:35.072
Whoever the guilty party is,
his recordings are telling.

34:35.074 --> 34:36.640
The USS<i> Camden</i>

34:36.642 --> 34:38.742
had 20 female sailors onboard,

34:38.744 --> 34:41.678
yet he only targeted
the two officers.

34:41.680 --> 34:43.480
These are the actions

34:43.482 --> 34:47.417
of a subordinate who resented
taking orders from a woman.

34:47.419 --> 34:50.554
The photos were his way
of getting back control.

34:50.556 --> 34:52.556
Skilled manipulator.

34:52.558 --> 34:55.559
Someone who knew
Meyers needed money.

34:55.561 --> 34:57.861
That's how they got him
to take the fall.

34:57.863 --> 34:59.863
GIBBS:
<i> If Meyers was killed</i>

34:59.865 --> 35:01.698
by someone on the USS<i> Camden,</i>

35:01.700 --> 35:04.768
then our crew list
is our suspect list.

35:04.770 --> 35:06.736
How many onboard?

35:06.738 --> 35:08.738
352.
Ooh.

35:08.740 --> 35:11.274
All right, we need
to check their bank accounts

35:11.276 --> 35:14.711
for any cash withdrawals
in the $15,000 arena.

35:14.713 --> 35:16.713
Already did.
Got nothing.

35:16.715 --> 35:19.416
I've got something.
Oh, hey.

35:19.418 --> 35:20.851
Delilah gave us an update.

35:20.853 --> 35:22.319
Glad Jake's okay.

35:22.321 --> 35:23.753
You heard from him?
Not yet,

35:23.755 --> 35:24.788
but I will.

35:24.790 --> 35:26.123
Sure you want to be here?

35:26.125 --> 35:29.826
Guys... I am fine. Really.

35:29.828 --> 35:31.628
Did I mention I have a lead?

35:31.630 --> 35:33.463
Oh, yeah, you know,
I'll handle the clicker,

35:33.465 --> 35:35.398
'cause I got the...
and you don't want the.

35:35.400 --> 35:37.200
Okay.
I finally
got in touch

35:37.202 --> 35:38.435
with Howard Falconio,

35:38.437 --> 35:40.303
the original owner
of the recording device.

35:40.305 --> 35:42.472
Navy guy?
Only if you count
<i>Call of Duty.</i>

35:42.474 --> 35:44.341
Click.
Oh.

35:44.343 --> 35:46.476
Falconio is a hardcore gamer.

35:46.478 --> 35:48.478
Mm. No kidding.

35:48.480 --> 35:51.882
Bet he's got more
cosplay outfits than you, McGoo.

35:51.884 --> 35:53.350
BISHOP:
Falconio

35:53.352 --> 35:54.885
sold the camera
on Craigslist...

35:54.887 --> 35:57.254
Uh, click.
Oh.

35:57.256 --> 35:59.723
...to Petty Officer
Peter Woodruff.

35:59.725 --> 36:02.325
The guy who Meyers confessed to.

36:02.327 --> 36:04.561
McGEE:
While in the Navy,
Woodruff was twice

36:04.563 --> 36:07.531
denied acceptance into the
Navy's Commissioning Program.

36:07.533 --> 36:10.167
Woodruff was trying to make
the jump from enlisted ranks

36:10.169 --> 36:11.501
to a Naval officer.

36:11.503 --> 36:12.736
Well, they got it right.

36:12.738 --> 36:16.506
Definitely not officer material.

36:16.508 --> 36:17.874
(door bell tinkle)

36:17.876 --> 36:20.343
What's going on, Captain?

36:20.345 --> 36:22.746
Why the urgent phone call?

36:25.751 --> 36:29.886
You can't go home
or to your office.

36:29.888 --> 36:32.289
NCIS is looking for you.

36:32.291 --> 36:33.557
They said

36:33.559 --> 36:36.293
you manipulated
Petty Officer Meyers

36:36.295 --> 36:38.662
into taking the fall
for the recording device,

36:38.664 --> 36:40.931
and then shot him
before he could tell the truth.

36:40.933 --> 36:42.699
All lies, sir.
I don't know who feeding...

36:42.701 --> 36:45.135
Peter, enough. Just...

36:45.136 --> 36:47.570
Just cut the crap
and let's talk man to man.

36:47.573 --> 36:50.440
I know you're the one

36:50.442 --> 36:52.442
who planted the camera

36:52.444 --> 36:54.711
and spread those photos.

36:54.713 --> 36:56.613
I've known for years.

36:56.615 --> 36:58.815
Truth is, the military

36:58.817 --> 37:03.520
has fallen victim
to the... political agenda.

37:03.522 --> 37:06.823
Those guys on the hill
forcing quotas so they can

37:06.825 --> 37:09.726
say that
there's gender equality.

37:09.728 --> 37:13.997
These women didn't get
where they are based on merit.

37:13.999 --> 37:16.600
So, why didn't you turn me in?

37:16.602 --> 37:18.602
You and I-- we're...

37:18.604 --> 37:20.370
cut from the same cloth.

37:20.372 --> 37:22.472
I started out enlisted,

37:22.474 --> 37:25.675
and just like you,
I was often...

37:25.677 --> 37:29.713
overlooked for those
less qualified.

37:30.649 --> 37:32.749
It isn't right.

37:32.751 --> 37:34.618
You took a stand.

37:34.620 --> 37:37.787
I admired that.

37:37.789 --> 37:40.223
(door bells tinkle)

37:40.224 --> 37:42.658
That's why I kept my mouth shut
all these years, and that's why

37:42.661 --> 37:45.462
I'm going to help you
out of this mess now.

37:52.304 --> 37:55.405
What does NCIS have on me?

37:55.407 --> 37:57.307
The camera connecting you
to Meyers.

37:57.309 --> 37:59.042
It's circumstantial.
Yes, but...

37:59.044 --> 38:01.044
shooting Meyers

38:01.046 --> 38:03.680
really mucked things up.

38:03.682 --> 38:07.917
You need to get ahead of NCIS
before they find something.

38:07.919 --> 38:11.054
They won't. I made sure
no one saw me at the park.

38:11.056 --> 38:13.323
No witnesses, no evidence.

38:13.324 --> 38:15.591
What about the rifle?
It needs to be destroyed.
It's gone.

38:15.594 --> 38:18.862
I wiped it clean
and tossed it in the Potomac.

38:18.864 --> 38:21.631
I'm in the clear, sir.

38:27.072 --> 38:29.773
We're done here.

38:29.775 --> 38:31.808
You get what you need?

38:31.810 --> 38:34.077
Oh, yeah.

38:36.381 --> 38:37.881
Captain, thank you very much.
Least

38:37.883 --> 38:39.683
I could do for our Navy.
I trusted you.

38:39.685 --> 38:42.052
How could you do this to me?

38:42.054 --> 38:43.820
Two sailors are dead
because of you.

38:43.822 --> 38:45.522
Ensign Ashley Ryan,

38:45.524 --> 38:46.756
Petty Officer Adam Meyers.

38:46.758 --> 38:48.425
How could you do this to<i> them?</i>

38:48.427 --> 38:50.560
When Meyers said that
he was gonna tell the truth,

38:50.562 --> 38:52.279
I panicked.

38:52.280 --> 38:53.997
It was all an accident. None
of this was supposed to happen.

38:53.999 --> 38:55.965
The hidden camera, the photos,
staging Meyers' murder.

38:55.967 --> 38:58.468
Everything you've done
has been premeditated.

38:58.470 --> 38:59.803
You're gonna answer for it.

39:01.773 --> 39:03.840
(door bells tinkle)

39:05.677 --> 39:07.877
Tony, you know itching
only makes it worse.

39:07.879 --> 39:09.979
Hold on. I got
something for you.

39:11.717 --> 39:13.817
Calamine lotion.

39:13.819 --> 39:15.785
Works wonders, trust me.

39:15.787 --> 39:17.954
Yes! Of course!

39:17.956 --> 39:20.724
McGee, you're such a good friend
to me. Calamine lotion.

39:20.726 --> 39:22.792
Hey.

39:24.796 --> 39:27.964
I entrust my... health
to your healing hands.

39:27.966 --> 39:29.899
No, no. I am not...

39:29.901 --> 39:31.768
What do you think--
I'm gonna lather you?

39:31.770 --> 39:34.003
No. Do it yourself.

39:36.942 --> 39:39.776
I can't reach certain areas.

39:39.778 --> 39:41.611
Come on. Please?

39:41.613 --> 39:43.646
Look, no one's around.

39:43.648 --> 39:44.981
It'll be between us.

39:44.983 --> 39:46.850
McGee, come on.

39:46.852 --> 39:48.818
I need you.

39:48.820 --> 39:52.856
I'm dying here!

39:55.794 --> 39:56.760
Okay, sounds good.

39:56.762 --> 39:58.428
Oh, thank God.

39:58.430 --> 39:59.629
(Bishop sighs)

39:59.631 --> 40:00.830
I will.

40:00.832 --> 40:02.699
Love you, too. Bye.

40:02.701 --> 40:04.701
(sighs)

40:04.703 --> 40:06.703
That was Jake.

40:06.705 --> 40:09.072
He's at the U.S. Embassy.

40:09.074 --> 40:11.908
NSA cut his
assignment short,

40:11.910 --> 40:14.844
and he will be back
at the end of the week.

40:14.846 --> 40:16.946
Sounds like a perfect time
for a vacation.

40:16.948 --> 40:18.782
That is exactly what Jake said.

40:18.784 --> 40:20.550
So, you coming?
Uh, not just yet.

40:20.552 --> 40:22.786
You guys go ahead.

40:22.788 --> 40:24.988
Wait. Almost forgot.

40:24.990 --> 40:27.490
Abby wanted me to give

40:27.492 --> 40:28.858
these to you.

40:28.860 --> 40:31.995
She ordered me not
to open them on pain of death.

40:31.997 --> 40:33.630
TONY:
All right, come on, McGee.

40:33.632 --> 40:36.433
We' got a date with
some rubber gloves and lotion.

40:37.769 --> 40:39.436
Let's make this happen.

40:39.438 --> 40:40.870
Don't ask.

40:43.909 --> 40:45.975
(elevator bell dings)

41:17.576 --> 41:19.509
(elevator bell dings)

41:20.879 --> 41:23.580
Oh. I thought you already left.

41:23.582 --> 41:25.715
No.

41:25.717 --> 41:27.951
Looking for you.

41:34.693 --> 41:37.894
It's been a long two days,
Gibbs.

41:37.896 --> 41:40.263
Don't really want
to talk about it right now.

41:42.968 --> 41:45.001
Good by me.

41:45.003 --> 41:47.070
(elevator bell dings)

42:03.588 --> 42:05.655
Seven minutes.

42:11.029 --> 42:12.929
That's how close Jake came.

42:19.037 --> 42:23.606
400 and 20 seconds, and...

42:27.145 --> 42:30.213
...I could've lost him, Gibbs.

42:30.215 --> 42:33.850
But you didn't
lose him, Ellie.

42:33.852 --> 42:36.753
Jake's safe, and
he's coming home.

42:45.997 --> 42:48.064
Everything's gonna
be all right.

42:51.202 --> 42:53.303
(Gibbs sighs slightly)

42:53.305 --> 42:55.572
(Bishop sighs)
