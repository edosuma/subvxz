WEBVTT

00:13.560 --> 00:16.000
-Doron!
-Boaz!

00:17.400 --> 00:19.080
Motherfucker... Boaz!

00:19.240 --> 00:20.480
Doron, I'm wiping them out.

00:20.640 --> 00:22.360
-Motherfucker...
-Doron, what do I do?

00:22.520 --> 00:25.640
Doron, talk to me! Doron!

00:25.880 --> 00:27.120
Shut up!

00:27.280 --> 00:28.520
Let him go!

00:28.680 --> 00:30.760
-Doron!
-Go!

00:39.120 --> 00:40.680
[ARABIC]
[Sheikh!]

00:41.760 --> 00:43.080
Doron, don't!

00:47.760 --> 00:49.480
[Walid, what's going on?]

00:50.880 --> 00:52.240
[What's going on?]

00:57.480 --> 00:59.000
[Drive!]

01:25.760 --> 01:27.480
You okay?

01:33.240 --> 01:34.480
Abir.

01:35.440 --> 01:36.680
Abir.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.600
Doron!

01:47.880 --> 01:49.440
Doron!

01:49.600 --> 01:51.160
Doron!

02:39.080 --> 02:41.400
Two explosions were reported
in Wadi Zaitoon.

02:41.560 --> 02:43.120
Show me an aerial photo.

02:46.200 --> 02:48.000
This was taken six minutes ago.

03:04.040 --> 03:05.640
Boaz is dead.

03:23.560 --> 03:24.920
Yes, Moreno?

03:25.760 --> 03:28.960
We've got a positive ID.
Boaz is dead.

03:32.000 --> 03:35.480
-Where's Doron Kabilio?
-We'll find him soon. Boaz is dead.

03:35.640 --> 03:37.920
-I asked you a question.
-I don't know where he is, Gideon.

03:38.080 --> 03:39.280
Mr. Defense Minister, to you!

03:39.440 --> 03:41.720
And if I ask you to track him down,
you leave everything

03:41.880 --> 03:44.760
and bring his sorry ass
down here stat!

03:44.920 --> 03:47.440
-It would be best to--
-It'd be best if you weren't born,

03:47.600 --> 03:50.280
then this unit could
have a real commander,

03:50.440 --> 03:52.080
and avoid this catastrophe!

03:52.800 --> 03:54.440
Go track him down!

03:56.320 --> 03:58.960
Send someone to collect
all of Boaz's remains

03:59.480 --> 04:01.640
and to leave nothing in the area.

04:01.800 --> 04:03.640
And find Kabilio. Stat.

04:03.800 --> 04:05.080
Send another chopper
and a drone.

04:05.240 --> 04:07.920
We must get Doron
back before he's captured.

04:08.080 --> 04:09.720
That's the primary task now.

04:09.920 --> 04:12.440
Word got out.
Al Jazeera has the initial report,

04:12.600 --> 04:14.800
but they still don't understand
what exactly happened.

04:15.400 --> 04:18.640
There's also a report of a girl
with an explosive belt at the scene.

04:18.800 --> 04:23.360
A girl with an explosive belt?
These people are animals.

04:23.520 --> 04:26.440
-It was us.
-What do you mean?

04:26.600 --> 04:29.080
We strapped that belt on her.

04:29.480 --> 04:31.520
But she's alive, thank God.

04:32.520 --> 04:36.200
Hear that? Fly the girl
to Hadassah Hospital right now,

04:36.360 --> 04:38.720
and locate that son of a bitch.

04:43.400 --> 04:44.960
He's completely lost it.

04:45.320 --> 04:48.400
If he pulls a Baruch Goldstein stunt,
we're all screwed.

05:07.560 --> 05:09.240
[What happened?]

05:12.160 --> 05:14.520
[Catastrophe.
Catastrophe.]

05:14.680 --> 05:17.080
[-What about Abir?]
[-I think she was wounded.]

05:19.360 --> 05:21.960
[-Is she alive?]
[-I don't know, I'm not sure.]

05:22.120 --> 05:23.520
[You were there,
didn't you see?]

05:23.680 --> 05:27.080
[I saw her lying on the ground,
I don't know if she was alive.]

05:30.800 --> 05:32.520
[What about the Sheikh?]

05:32.680 --> 05:34.600
[He died a Shahid.]

05:44.680 --> 05:46.320
[May God have mercy on him.]

05:46.600 --> 05:48.240
[Let me think.]

05:49.360 --> 05:52.760
[To think?
Now you want to think?!]

05:52.920 --> 05:55.360
[You should've done that
before ordering me]

05:55.520 --> 05:56.600
[to blow him to bits!]

05:56.760 --> 05:58.440
[Watch it! Do you know
who you're talking to?]

05:58.600 --> 06:01.120
[Yes, I know full well
who I'm talking to.]

06:01.280 --> 06:04.660
[The only thing that matters to you
is revenge. Your decisions stink!]

06:04.820 --> 06:06.280
[Walid!]

06:06.440 --> 06:08.440
[Have you forgotten that I raised you
with my own two hands?]

06:08.600 --> 06:11.440
[The Sheikh is dead because of you
and God knows what's with Abir.]

06:11.600 --> 06:15.080
[If it weren't for your fucking cousin,
this wouldn't have happened!]

06:15.240 --> 06:17.440
[Don't you talk about her like that!]

06:17.600 --> 06:18.920
[Think about it!]

06:19.080 --> 06:22.040
[How did the Jews know
he was booby-trapped?]

06:22.440 --> 06:26.040
[It's easy for you
to pin it all on her, huh?]

06:26.200 --> 06:29.040
[Who else then? You?
How did they know?]

06:29.200 --> 06:30.600
[She'd never tell anyone.]

06:30.760 --> 06:33.440
[Stop whining like a baby!]

06:33.760 --> 06:37.760
[You're either a fighter
or a child.]

06:39.560 --> 06:41.360
[Bring her here.]

06:49.480 --> 06:51.800
[You're making a big mistake.]

06:52.400 --> 06:54.120
[She's my daughter.]

06:54.520 --> 06:56.920
[What will people think
of you if you let her]

06:57.080 --> 06:58.920
[get treated in
an Israeli hospital?]

06:59.080 --> 07:02.600
[My daughter is there. Who cares
what people will think of me?]

07:02.840 --> 07:04.520
[You know what they'll call you?]

07:04.680 --> 07:06.440
[A traitor.]

07:06.720 --> 07:09.720
[That you collaborated with Israel
to get treatment for your daughter.]

07:09.880 --> 07:11.120
[Have you forgotten Ali Karmi?]

07:11.280 --> 07:14.400
[Ali did it for his daughter's sake,
and I think he's a hero.]

07:14.800 --> 07:17.280
[I think he knew the price
he would pay.]

07:17.440 --> 07:20.440
[Our family never collaborated
with the Israelis,]

07:20.600 --> 07:22.280
[and you're a member
of this family.]

07:22.440 --> 07:25.320
[Have your daughter treated
in a Palestinian hospital.]

07:26.240 --> 07:29.520
[Enough. I'm taking the kids
and getting out of this town.]

07:29.680 --> 07:30.960
[Watch Ahmad for me.]

07:31.120 --> 07:34.680
[Tell him that I went to get Abir
and that I'm coming back for him.]

07:43.440 --> 07:45.600
[-What is it, dear?]
[-A call for Nassrin.]

07:45.760 --> 07:46.720
[Thanks.]

07:48.480 --> 07:51.280
[-Hello?]
[-Hi, Mother.]

07:51.880 --> 07:53.400
[Hello, my dear son.]

07:53.560 --> 07:55.160
[How's Abir?]

07:55.320 --> 07:56.720
[Is she alive?]

07:56.880 --> 07:58.960
[Yes, my son.
Abir is alive,]

07:59.120 --> 08:01.440
[but her eye was wounded.]

08:03.000 --> 08:04.840
[Praise God.]

08:06.640 --> 08:08.960
[Is Nassrin there?
Put her on.]

08:09.120 --> 08:12.940
[Nassrin is here, but...]

08:13.100 --> 08:15.200
[She can't come to the phone.]

08:15.960 --> 08:19.240
[What do you mean?
Let me talk to her.]

08:19.400 --> 08:22.080
[Talk to him.
Talk to him.]

08:23.640 --> 08:28.200
[Hold on. She's too upset
to talk now. Stay on the line.]

08:31.360 --> 08:34.000
[Don't hang it up,
stay here.]

08:35.720 --> 08:37.320
[Talk to him, I tell you.]

08:37.480 --> 08:39.720
[He's your husband,
the father of your children.]

08:39.880 --> 08:42.480
[You and the children
mean the world to him.]

08:42.640 --> 08:46.000
[You're the air
that Abu Ahmad breathes.]

08:46.240 --> 08:47.960
[You're talking to me
about the children?]

08:48.120 --> 08:50.240
[Do you even hear yourself?]

08:50.480 --> 08:55.200
[You think we're in favor
of this war? That we want it?]

08:55.360 --> 08:58.680
[-You're not the only one suffering here.]
[-Enough!]

08:58.840 --> 09:02.400
[Stop using my anguish
as an excuse for your son's doing.]

09:03.160 --> 09:08.480
[Whether you like it or not, people
think of you as the Panther's widow.]

09:08.640 --> 09:11.720
[I really wish I were
the Panther's widow.]

09:24.840 --> 09:27.200
[My dear son,
my love,]

09:28.240 --> 09:30.420
[Nassrin...]

09:30.580 --> 09:33.440
[...went to visit Abir
at the Israeli hospital.]

09:57.880 --> 09:59.880
[Do you need any help?]

10:00.040 --> 10:01.680
[Come, I'll help you.]

10:40.200 --> 10:41.560
Gali, it's me.

10:45.440 --> 10:47.880
The Rabbi is here,
he wants to talk to you.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.160
Not now.

10:57.720 --> 10:59.520
Can I come in?

11:01.200 --> 11:03.320
Come on, Gali,
open the door.

11:03.480 --> 11:05.040
No.

11:12.840 --> 11:15.000
Well, I'm here if you need me.

11:17.680 --> 11:19.160
Thanks.

11:28.880 --> 11:33.600
This was his first Hanukkah
celebration in kindergarten.

11:34.960 --> 11:37.320
Here he's dressed up
as a clown in pajamas.

12:50.400 --> 12:53.080
[Please, my daughter
is in the hospital.]

12:53.840 --> 12:56.480
Sorry, it's an emergency,
my daughter is in the hospital.

12:56.640 --> 12:57.560
[Go ahead.]

12:57.720 --> 12:58.840
[-May I?]
[-Sure.]

12:59.000 --> 13:00.280
-Good morning.
-ID, please.

13:00.440 --> 13:01.720
Yes.

13:05.720 --> 13:08.000
[Sunglasses off.]

13:10.040 --> 13:12.200
-Come with me, please.
-What's the problem?

13:12.360 --> 13:13.800
[Come on.]

13:13.960 --> 13:15.360
Excuse me.

13:21.840 --> 13:23.680
Why you took--

13:32.360 --> 13:34.520
[-Strip.]
-Why?

13:34.680 --> 13:35.640
[Strip.]

13:48.560 --> 13:52.960
My daughter is in the hospital.
She's alone.

13:53.120 --> 13:55.080
[-My daughter is in the--]
[-Shut up.]

14:07.680 --> 14:09.560
[Come on,
shoes off.]

14:09.760 --> 14:11.680
Shoes, shoes.

14:16.240 --> 14:19.320
[Come on, strip, faster.]

14:23.600 --> 14:25.760
[My daughter is alone
in the hospital. She's eight.]

14:25.920 --> 14:26.800
[Faster.]

14:33.320 --> 14:34.880
[Strip.]

14:43.360 --> 14:45.040
[The Hijab.]

15:11.200 --> 15:12.880
[Bow your head.]

15:25.040 --> 15:26.680
Get out, please.

15:26.920 --> 15:29.680
Get out! Idiot.

15:33.520 --> 15:36.960
[-Sorry about her degrading behavior.]
[-It's alright.]

15:37.120 --> 15:40.080
[I'll wait outside while you get dressed.
I'll drive you there.]

15:46.600 --> 15:48.720
Quite the actress.
You deserve an Oscar.

15:48.880 --> 15:50.600
Any time, Gabi.

15:55.080 --> 15:57.240
[It's hot like hell, damn it.]

16:14.920 --> 16:17.840
[I really apologize for her behavior.]

16:18.000 --> 16:20.040
[There was no reason for that.]

16:20.640 --> 16:24.240
[I don't care about that.
Where is Abir?]

16:24.400 --> 16:26.280
[Do you know where she is?]

16:27.240 --> 16:29.520
[She's in
Hadassah Medical Center.]

16:30.280 --> 16:33.880
[She was wounded in her eye,
she needs surgery.]

16:34.320 --> 16:37.320
[How bad is it?
Can she see?]

16:37.480 --> 16:38.560
[How is she?]

16:38.720 --> 16:40.960
[We'll know
only after the surgery.]

16:44.720 --> 16:49.120
[I want to transfer her here,
to Ramallah, for her surgery.]

16:49.280 --> 16:53.120
[Wait. First speak with the doctor,
then decide.]

16:53.280 --> 16:57.560
[I already made my decision. I want
to transfer her to Ramallah, please.]

17:11.600 --> 17:13.800
In all my 22 years
of work for the security forces

17:13.960 --> 17:15.760
I have never seen
anything like this.

17:15.920 --> 17:18.080
It's mutiny.
That's exactly what this is.

17:18.240 --> 17:20.160
Moreno, we had to,
they kidnapped Boaz.

17:20.320 --> 17:22.400
Shut your mouth!
If it weren't for me,

17:22.560 --> 17:25.080
you'd still be stealing car radios
in poor neighborhoods,

17:25.240 --> 17:28.800
and this is how you thank me?
By undermining my authority?!

17:29.680 --> 17:31.480
By breaking apart my unit?

17:31.640 --> 17:33.760
In any developed country,
the four of you would be executed,

17:33.920 --> 17:36.800
so just be thankful
we've got a shitty country.

17:36.960 --> 17:39.560
Had we brought Boaz back alive
we wouldn't be having this talk.

17:39.720 --> 17:44.160
But you didn't did you?
So shut the hell up, all of you!

17:44.320 --> 17:47.560
I'm just saying that we failed
operationally, not ethically.

17:47.720 --> 17:49.960
Avihai, buddy,
do me a favor--

17:50.120 --> 17:52.080
So what happens now, Moreno?
Jail?

17:52.240 --> 17:54.480
-I'll know when the investigation is over.
-And the team?

17:54.640 --> 17:55.560
The team--

17:55.720 --> 18:00.000
-Well, the team--
-Okay, stop, Moreno.

18:00.160 --> 18:03.920
We get it. Let's go.
We'll see you around.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.400
You know,

18:12.760 --> 18:16.840
if I had to do it all over again,
I'd do it exactly the same way.

18:21.040 --> 18:22.360
Sit.

18:28.200 --> 18:32.200
-I think he's fucking Nurit.
-Is that all you gathered from that talk?

18:32.760 --> 18:36.320
-That and something about mutiny.
-Idiot.

18:36.800 --> 18:40.080
-What will you do now?
-I don't know.

18:40.240 --> 18:43.520
Maybe I'll go to the Yehuda desert
for a bit. I could use the silence.

18:43.680 --> 18:46.520
Yeah, because you've
been yapping nonstop.

18:46.760 --> 18:49.160
Certainly less
than you and Boaz.

18:51.840 --> 18:53.520
[God have mercy on his soul.]

18:54.360 --> 18:55.880
Poor bastard.

18:57.440 --> 19:00.720
-He fucked like a rabbit.
-Yep.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.600
Guys who get laid the most
always die young.

19:04.760 --> 19:08.520
-That's why you'll live forever.
-You bet.

19:09.120 --> 19:10.440
Well...

19:11.200 --> 19:15.520
-Would you really do it all over again?
-Of course.

19:15.960 --> 19:17.400
Would you?

19:18.000 --> 19:21.320
My only regret is
not putting the moves on Nurit.

19:21.480 --> 19:24.280
Forget it,
she'd reject you anyway.

19:31.960 --> 19:33.960
Don't you ever do that
to me again.

19:35.120 --> 19:38.320
-Aren't you kicking me out too?
-No, you had no choice.

19:39.200 --> 19:42.740
-And the other guys did?
-Forget them, they're history.

19:42.900 --> 19:45.200
I want you to keep being
our Intelligence officer.

19:45.680 --> 19:47.640
You'll decide
when to join missions

19:47.800 --> 19:51.280
and when to stay here with me.
You'll be your own boss.

19:51.880 --> 19:54.080
I also want you to help us
form another team.

19:54.240 --> 19:54.960
Us?

19:55.120 --> 19:57.360
Naor and me.
He'll be team commander.

19:57.520 --> 20:01.360
-What if Doron comes back?
-He has nothing waiting for him

20:01.520 --> 20:05.080
here in Israel,
only a court sentence and jail.

20:07.200 --> 20:08.720
What do you say?

20:10.960 --> 20:12.960
I'm sorry, but I can't stay.

20:29.400 --> 20:30.840
What is it?

20:32.400 --> 20:34.800
You can't kick them out
and keep me.

20:35.240 --> 20:37.080
-I can.
-But I can't.

20:37.240 --> 20:39.000
Nurit, think about it.

20:39.320 --> 20:42.120
You're the only one
who's getting another chance.

20:42.360 --> 20:44.200
Take it.

20:50.320 --> 20:52.720
Who ever thought
I could say no?

21:19.040 --> 21:20.000
-Hello.
-Hello.

21:20.160 --> 21:22.080
-Thanks for seeing us right away.
-Sure thing.

21:22.240 --> 21:23.640
This is Nassrin,
Abir's mother.

21:23.800 --> 21:26.320
[Nassrin, Prof. Shalit is the doctor
who's treating Abir.]

21:26.480 --> 21:28.560
-Nice to meet you, Professor.
-Nice to meet you too.

21:28.720 --> 21:31.360
I want to tell you that Abir
is a charming little girl.

21:31.520 --> 21:33.960
-Thanks. How is she?
-She had a lot of luck.

21:34.120 --> 21:36.400
She's conscious,
but her left eye is in danger.

21:36.560 --> 21:38.880
If we won't operate soon,
she might lose her sight

21:39.040 --> 21:40.800
and maybe even the eye itself.

21:40.960 --> 21:45.000
[Don't worry. Prof. Shalit is Israel's
number one expert in eye injuries]

21:45.160 --> 21:47.000
[and one of the best in the world.]

21:47.160 --> 21:49.120
I did hundreds
of operations like this.

21:49.280 --> 21:51.040
No, please transfer her
to Ramallah,

21:51.200 --> 21:53.280
-we have enough good doctors of our own.
-I'm sure you do,

21:53.440 --> 21:55.680
but you don't have in Ramallah
the equipment that we have here.

21:55.840 --> 21:57.360
[And you don't have
Prof. Shalit.]

21:57.520 --> 22:01.400
-No, I can't. I can't.
-Believe me, I understand your fear,

22:01.560 --> 22:04.280
but right now you must think only
about what's best for your daughter,

22:04.440 --> 22:07.760
-not about anything else.
-No, I can't.

22:07.920 --> 22:10.520
Nassrin, I will watch Abir
and take care of her

22:10.680 --> 22:12.200
as if she's my own daughter.

22:12.800 --> 22:14.800
It'll take time until
you get to Ramallah

22:14.960 --> 22:17.520
and every moment now
is important to save the eye.

22:17.680 --> 22:21.200
I'm sorry, I have to go now.
Please let me know what you decide.

22:21.360 --> 22:22.400
Thank you.

22:28.800 --> 22:30.640
[Want some water?]

22:30.960 --> 22:32.600
[Do you?]

22:33.440 --> 22:35.720
Could she get some water, please?

22:45.000 --> 22:46.360
Thanks.

23:01.600 --> 23:03.280
[Listen.]

23:04.480 --> 23:06.720
[To me, the best time
of the year is]

23:06.880 --> 23:09.200
[when I take my five kids
to the desert.]

23:09.360 --> 23:12.400
[No phones, no emails,
nothing.]

23:12.640 --> 23:15.320
[We sleep out there
and go for hikes.]

23:16.120 --> 23:18.600
[One time,
in the middle of a hike,]

23:18.760 --> 23:23.200
[my youngest son Nadav
was bitten by a viper.]

23:24.160 --> 23:25.840
[I panicked,]

23:26.000 --> 23:27.880
[and made every possible mistake]

23:28.040 --> 23:32.040
[trying to do things I'd seen in movies,
on TV.]

23:33.520 --> 23:37.760
[We made it to the hospital
in the nick of time.]

23:37.920 --> 23:40.840
[The kid was more dead
than alive.]

23:41.280 --> 23:46.600
[But the best possible doctor
was on duty just then,]

23:46.840 --> 23:49.080
[and he saved the boy.]

23:50.040 --> 23:52.120
[It was an Arab doctor.]

23:54.160 --> 23:57.080
[I found you
the best doctor we've got.]

24:08.280 --> 24:10.240
[I want to see her now.]

24:30.600 --> 24:32.760
[-Mommy.]
[-Yes, my daughter?]

24:33.240 --> 24:34.800
[Are you staying here with me?]

24:34.960 --> 24:38.760
[Of course I am.
I'm not leaving your side.]

24:38.920 --> 24:41.080
[What will they do to me?]

24:42.200 --> 24:44.880
[Just a small operation.]

24:45.280 --> 24:48.560
[You'll be asleep,
so you won't feel a thing.]

24:48.720 --> 24:53.000
[Don't be scared. I got you
the best doctor in the world.]

24:53.600 --> 24:57.320
[-I'm not scared.]
[-I know. You're so brave.]

25:00.240 --> 25:02.380
[Are we in Israel, Mommy?]

25:02.540 --> 25:03.960
[Yes, my daughter.]

25:04.120 --> 25:07.480
[The doctor said
he'll take care of my eye,]

25:07.640 --> 25:09.840
[and he gave me some candy.]

25:10.000 --> 25:12.400
[They're all Jews here,
right, Mommy?]

25:13.400 --> 25:18.560
[I think you're tired
and you should rest, right?]

25:19.680 --> 25:22.000
[-Get some sleep.]
[-Okay.]

25:22.520 --> 25:24.600
[Close your eyes.]

25:24.760 --> 25:29.880
<i>[Go to sleep, my little child]</i>

25:30.800 --> 25:35.800
<i>[Let's fall asleep on the carpet]</i>

25:37.080 --> 25:41.880
<i>[Sleep in the darkness]</i>

25:42.920 --> 25:47.400
<i>[Until the cloud shall pass]</i>

25:48.680 --> 25:52.400
<i>[Obscuring all the neighbors...]</i>

26:21.840 --> 26:25.240
[Peace be upon you.
What happened to you?]

26:25.400 --> 26:28.160
[Come with me,
let's go to the mosque.]

26:42.920 --> 26:44.400
[Thank you.]

26:58.040 --> 26:59.760
[In the name
of the all merciful Allah,]

26:59.920 --> 27:03.040
[I hereby purify myself for prayer.
Allahu Akbar.]

28:03.200 --> 28:04.680
He's here.

28:20.280 --> 28:22.200
Anything you want to say?

28:22.400 --> 28:24.720
They're a bunch of screw-ups.

28:24.880 --> 28:27.080
I discharged them.
To hell with them.

28:27.240 --> 28:29.360
I only kept Naor
as team commander.

28:29.520 --> 28:32.240
We'll form a new team.
There're excellent guys out there.

28:32.400 --> 28:35.000
Listen, Moreno,
I'll make it snappy.

28:35.480 --> 28:38.800
This unit, this fiasco, is over.

28:38.960 --> 28:41.880
-That's what I just said.
-No, it's not.

28:42.040 --> 28:43.720
You want to start
everything from scratch.

28:43.880 --> 28:46.360
Right. Naor had nothing to do with this
fiasco, he'll be a great commander.

28:46.520 --> 28:48.480
You're not listening to me.

28:49.200 --> 28:52.080
Your men led this country
to the brink of war.

28:53.200 --> 28:56.360
You know how that Sheikh
blowing up damaged my reputation?!

28:56.520 --> 28:59.080
Not to mention Boaz
and the little girl.

29:03.040 --> 29:07.200
Sorry, but I must discharge you
and disassemble the team.

29:07.400 --> 29:08.720
What?

29:09.400 --> 29:11.120
You're discharging me?

29:12.640 --> 29:14.440
You can't do that.

29:16.240 --> 29:19.240
Think long and hard
before you do this.

29:19.960 --> 29:23.520
You know that you got this far
thanks to my dirty work.

29:23.680 --> 29:26.040
Moreno, you've lost your touch.

29:26.360 --> 29:30.560
Even your criminals lost faith in you
and kept you out of the loop.

29:32.000 --> 29:36.360
Back in the day, you would resign
without me having to kick you out.

29:37.640 --> 29:41.600
-I've never been discharged.
-You think you deserve an award?

29:41.960 --> 29:43.640
A bravery medal?

29:49.400 --> 29:52.600
Don't worry, I'll make sure
you get a large pension.

29:53.760 --> 29:56.440
After all, you've done some
great things for this country.

30:01.760 --> 30:03.920
Screw you, Gideon.

30:15.520 --> 30:19.880
TO MICKEY MORENO
WITH ALL OUR APPRECIATION

32:16.240 --> 32:17.720
Hello?

32:20.720 --> 32:22.280
Hello?

32:23.360 --> 32:25.200
Doron, is that you?

32:27.240 --> 32:28.560
Doron?

32:29.280 --> 32:30.680
Doron?

32:31.000 --> 32:32.840
Where are you?
Are you okay?

32:33.080 --> 32:35.600
Is it Dad?
Let me talk to him.

32:37.520 --> 32:41.520
-Talk, he's listening.
-Dad, where are you?

32:46.120 --> 32:49.680
Dad? Dad?

32:52.600 --> 32:56.080
-Call him back!
-It wasn't him.
