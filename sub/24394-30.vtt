We're walking through
the Walmart parking lot
right now in Chico.

28:07.834 --> 28:09.542
We have
domestic refugees here.

28:09.625 --> 28:13.333
It's a really, kind of,
strange thing to see
in your own state.

28:13.875 --> 28:15.583
Rudy Melashenko is
a school bus driver

28:15.667 --> 28:19.250
who was finishing his shift
when Paradise was evacuated.

28:20.417 --> 28:23.041
It was a bus route from hell
in Paradise

28:23.125 --> 28:25.041
is the way
I've described it.

28:25.917 --> 28:28.375
Man (over radio):
Leading north
of highway 70

28:28.458 --> 28:31.333
is mandatory
evacuation zone.

28:33.291 --> 28:36.208
Melashenko:
This is the very beginning
of the fires, okay?

28:36.291 --> 28:38.375
Toboni:
What's so striking
about this,

28:38.458 --> 28:41.291
it says 9:11 a.m.
and it's pitch dark.

28:41.375 --> 28:43.208
Melashenko:
It's pitch dark.
Everything was so black,

28:43.291 --> 28:45.959
I couldn't even tell
where I was, and I go
this route every day.

28:46.041 --> 28:49.000
Melashenko (in video):
Holy smokes.
That's right next to me.

28:49.875 --> 28:52.500
Oh, my gosh.

28:52.583 --> 28:54.291
Toboni: You're in
bumper-to-bumper traffic,

28:54.375 --> 28:56.542
and the fire's right
on the side of the road.

28:56.625 --> 28:59.792
Did you think, I don't know,
maybe you wouldn't make it?

28:59.875 --> 29:01.750
Melashenko:
This one scared me.

29:01.834 --> 29:03.583
Toboni:
Looks like
a 100-foot tree

29:03.667 --> 29:05.166
on fire,
right in front of you.

29:05.250 --> 29:08.542
-Did you, could you
feel the heat?
-Oh, yeah. Absolutely.

29:08.625 --> 29:11.583
Melashenko:
Now I'm back at my bus yard,
finally,

29:11.667 --> 29:15.583
and I see that this vehicle's
starting to catch fire.

29:15.667 --> 29:18.917
And right here are all
the gas tanks for the buses.

29:19.291 --> 29:21.458
I'm feeling like,
this is not safe,

29:21.542 --> 29:22.834
I've got to
get out of here.

29:22.917 --> 29:26.125
Um, anyway,
I could see
the school

29:26.208 --> 29:28.333
starting to catch fire
and stuff.

29:28.417 --> 29:30.333
And, um...
I'm sorry.

29:31.166 --> 29:35.500
Um, I didn't know
what was going to happen
then, but, um...

29:35.834 --> 29:39.041
(in video):
Oh, no, that's where
Bob Carley lives.

29:39.542 --> 29:41.375
Oh, no!

29:42.166 --> 29:45.583
Toboni:
As the town evacuated,
some cars ran out of gas,

29:45.667 --> 29:47.750
others were engulfed
in flames.

29:47.834 --> 29:49.625
So as residents
tried to escape

29:49.709 --> 29:52.583
on the few roads
out of Paradise,
they got stuck.

29:52.667 --> 29:55.375
Woman:
Heavenly Father,
please help us.

29:57.083 --> 29:59.333
Please help us
to be safe.

30:07.375 --> 30:09.917
Girl:
Oh, my God.

30:17.208 --> 30:18.792
Toboni:
With the fire
mostly contained,

30:18.875 --> 30:21.834
one of the big questions
for these residents now is,

30:21.917 --> 30:23.458
How did the fire start?

30:23.542 --> 30:25.458
While investigations
take months,

30:25.542 --> 30:27.667
Cal Fire is examining
electrical equipment

30:27.750 --> 30:30.667
operated by the largest
utility company in the state:

30:30.750 --> 30:32.125
PG&E.

30:32.625 --> 30:35.417
John Fiske:
You know this was
someone's home. Right?

30:35.875 --> 30:40.583
That's what is, uh...
lost in all of this.

30:41.250 --> 30:45.458
Is that there was
a home and a family

30:45.542 --> 30:47.291
and a life here.

30:47.375 --> 30:50.000
Toboni:
John Fiske, who litigated
against PG&E

30:50.083 --> 30:52.583
for damages in the 2017
wildfires,

30:52.667 --> 30:54.500
is already representing
residents

30:54.583 --> 30:57.375
who are suing the company
for the Camp Fire.

30:57.458 --> 30:59.583
Do you have any indication
of what caused this fire?

30:59.667 --> 31:02.083
We're starting to receive
news reports

31:02.166 --> 31:05.750
that this fire may involve
PG&E equipment.

31:05.834 --> 31:09.458
And so, um, right now,
we're looking at PG&E

31:09.542 --> 31:11.375
as a potential defendant,

31:11.458 --> 31:14.000
especially considering
its track record.

31:14.083 --> 31:16.000
California's largest
utility

31:16.083 --> 31:18.000
is found guilty
in a criminal trial

31:18.083 --> 31:20.709
from the San Bruno
pipeline explosion
in 2010.

31:20.792 --> 31:23.000
Newswoman:
PG&E has been ordered
to pay citations

31:23.083 --> 31:26.542
totaling more than $8 million
for safety violations

31:26.625 --> 31:29.917
tied to one of the most
destructive wildfires
in California history.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.375
PG&E power lines
are linked to at least two

31:32.458 --> 31:34.750
of the wine country wildfires.

31:34.834 --> 31:36.291
In the last
several years,

31:36.375 --> 31:39.709
PG&E has caused
several very
large-scale fires,

31:39.792 --> 31:42.750
going back to the
San Bruno explosion,

31:42.834 --> 31:45.542
the Butte fire of 2015,

31:45.625 --> 31:48.709
the North Bay fires of 2017.

31:48.792 --> 31:50.750
It seems like
it's almost every year.

31:50.834 --> 31:54.375
And so knowing that PG&E
is a multi-billion dollar
corporation,

31:54.458 --> 31:56.750
we look to see
whether or not PG&E

31:56.834 --> 32:00.041
is putting those resources
toward safety first.

32:00.125 --> 32:02.417
We do know that
PG&E has reported

32:02.500 --> 32:05.208
to the California
Public Utilities
Commission

32:05.291 --> 32:07.750
that there was a problem
with one of its lines

32:07.834 --> 32:10.375
about 15 minutes
prior to the start
of the fire.

32:10.458 --> 32:12.417
You've potentially
got notice,

32:12.500 --> 32:13.959
and you failed
to power down,

32:14.041 --> 32:15.709
and you failed to fix
that equipment.

32:15.792 --> 32:18.417
If it turns out
that PG&E's equipment

32:18.500 --> 32:20.417
is the cause and origin
of the fire,

32:20.500 --> 32:23.917
it's going to be a large,
multi-billion dollar
liability.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.583
And when you see
some of the most
destructive fires,

32:26.667 --> 32:28.667
caused by utilities,

32:28.750 --> 32:30.917
it comes to a head
in the political system.

32:31.000 --> 32:32.500
Toboni:
Just before the Camp Fire,

32:32.583 --> 32:34.417
the state legislature
heard arguments

32:34.500 --> 32:37.083
over who should pay
the billions in damages

32:37.166 --> 32:41.583
caused by downed power lines
in the 2017 Napa Sonoma fires.

32:42.166 --> 32:45.667
The state utility regulator,
Governor Brown, and PG&E
argued

32:45.750 --> 32:47.458
that because climate change
has increased

32:47.542 --> 32:49.500
the risk and severity
of wildfires,

32:49.583 --> 32:52.792
utilities should no longer
be held strictly liable,

32:52.875 --> 32:54.917
and should only be
responsible for damages

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
when a fire is caused
by their negligence

32:57.083 --> 32:58.458
or wrongdoing.

32:58.542 --> 33:00.458
The severity of the danger

33:00.542 --> 33:02.417
is only heightened
by climate change

33:02.500 --> 33:04.291
with storms of increasing
frequency

33:04.375 --> 33:06.750
that can topple poles
and snap power lines.

33:06.834 --> 33:09.959
And you're arguing that
maybe it's not climate change

33:10.041 --> 33:11.542
that's causing the risk.

33:11.625 --> 33:14.750
No. The way PG&E has designed
its infrastructure,

33:14.834 --> 33:16.625
causes the spark.

33:16.709 --> 33:19.583
Climate change
may exacerbate the situation,

33:19.667 --> 33:23.166
it's all the more reason
why we need to be protective
of homeowners,

33:23.250 --> 33:26.250
and ask these companies
to ask themselves,

33:26.333 --> 33:29.500
is our system designed
and used in a way

33:29.583 --> 33:31.417
that reduces that risk.

33:32.583 --> 33:35.208
Toboni:
That's what residents
like Terry Woolcox
are asking.

33:35.291 --> 33:38.750
The day before
the fire, PG&E sent out
emergency fliers,

33:38.834 --> 33:40.959
warning residents
that they might cut power

33:41.041 --> 33:42.667
due to high-risk
fire conditions.

33:42.750 --> 33:46.333
It says, "Important Notice.
Emergency may shut off

33:46.417 --> 33:47.458
for safety."

33:47.542 --> 33:49.667
That was on our door
that afternoon

33:49.750 --> 33:51.208
when we came home.

33:51.291 --> 33:55.041
And the fire started
at 6:30 the next morning.

33:55.667 --> 33:57.500
It says,
"Please take steps now

33:57.583 --> 33:59.667
"to ready for your
emergency plan.

33:59.750 --> 34:01.917
"To protect the public safety,
we may need

34:02.000 --> 34:04.917
"to temporarily
turn off electricity
in your neighborhood."

34:05.000 --> 34:07.709
-Toboni: So then, did
they turn off the power?
-Woolcox: No.

34:07.792 --> 34:09.458
Woolcox:
I know how these
power lines are

34:09.542 --> 34:11.291
and there's ones
that are weak,
or whatever.

34:11.375 --> 34:14.500
Once those two top lines,
or 30,000 volts, hit together,

34:14.583 --> 34:16.542
boom, it blows
the transformer.

34:16.625 --> 34:19.792
Throws sparks.
It's like lightening
or something.

34:20.208 --> 34:22.750
They should have
shut off their power.

34:23.291 --> 34:24.875
Toboni: PG&E declined
an interview,

34:24.959 --> 34:26.750
but reminded us that
the cause of the fire

34:26.834 --> 34:29.417
is still under investigation,
and said they're focused

34:29.500 --> 34:31.375
on supporting residents
at this time.

34:31.458 --> 34:33.208
While they haven't
been held responsible,

34:33.291 --> 34:35.542
there is a growing
distrust of the company

34:35.625 --> 34:37.125
among many consumers.

34:37.208 --> 34:38.917
But if they are found
responsible,

34:39.000 --> 34:40.291
the solution isn't as simple

34:40.375 --> 34:43.000
as them just coughing up
billions of dollars.

34:43.625 --> 34:45.041
Michael Wara is
a leading expert

34:45.125 --> 34:48.333
on climate and energy policy
at Stanford University.

34:48.417 --> 34:51.875
We won't know if PG&E
is held responsible
for this Camp Fire

34:51.959 --> 34:53.417
for probably
several months.

34:53.500 --> 34:56.125
If they are,
can they afford it?

34:56.542 --> 34:59.667
If PG&E is responsible
for this fire,

35:00.166 --> 35:02.125
the company is likely

35:02.208 --> 35:05.083
to have to seek
bankruptcy protection.

35:05.166 --> 35:09.291
Not so much a question
anymore of whether
PG&E could pay for

35:09.375 --> 35:12.166
what happened last year,
or what happened
last week.

35:12.250 --> 35:14.083
It's a question
of whether investors

35:14.166 --> 35:15.500
want to invest money
in a company

35:15.583 --> 35:18.125
that could generate the same
kind of loss next year,

35:18.208 --> 35:20.375
and the year after,
and the year after that.

35:20.917 --> 35:24.750
We have a situation
where the world
is creating

35:24.834 --> 35:27.750
a context
in which the utilities
can't make money,

35:27.834 --> 35:30.458
unless we fix
the problem.

35:30.542 --> 35:33.041
The drought that occurred
over the last decade

35:33.125 --> 35:36.000
was something like a
one-in-a-thousand-year event,

35:36.083 --> 35:39.291
so we have dead trees
all over the landscape.

35:39.375 --> 35:42.750
When a utility line
causes a fire,

35:42.834 --> 35:44.709
and you add
climate change
on top of that,

35:44.792 --> 35:46.750
instead of being a fire
that can be managed,

35:46.834 --> 35:49.291
and put out, and contained,

35:49.375 --> 35:52.583
it turns into something
that very quickly
spins out of control.

35:53.083 --> 35:56.625
I do think that
we need to really
be reexamining,

35:56.709 --> 35:59.542
kind of, how the system
is designed and operated

35:59.625 --> 36:00.959
in a pretty radical way.

36:01.041 --> 36:02.417
What would those
improvements be?

36:02.500 --> 36:04.792
Well, imagine a world
in which

36:04.875 --> 36:07.250
the homes in
wildfire country

36:07.333 --> 36:10.667
had a solar panel on their roof
and a battery in their garage

36:10.750 --> 36:12.875
such that when PG&E

36:12.959 --> 36:16.166
even felt the slightest desire
to turn the power off,

36:16.250 --> 36:19.834
it could, and there would be
no impact on customers.

36:19.917 --> 36:22.166
Part of the dynamic
that occurred in Paradise

36:22.250 --> 36:24.166
was that PG&E thought about

36:24.250 --> 36:26.125
turning off the power,
but didn't.

36:26.208 --> 36:28.500
I think the idea that
we're going to get

36:28.583 --> 36:31.000
to some level of perfection
that's acceptable,

36:31.083 --> 36:32.959
using the traditional
approaches

36:33.041 --> 36:34.667
of like, trimming
the trees better

36:34.750 --> 36:36.333
and inspecting
the lines more,

36:36.417 --> 36:37.542
is just not credible,

36:37.625 --> 36:39.500
because the situation
we're up against

36:39.583 --> 36:41.291
in terms of risk is
just too extreme.

36:41.375 --> 36:44.542
The consequences
for one mistake
are too large.

we've put that extra
increment of population

38:59.417 --> 39:01.750
into places that maybe
weren't safe.

39:02.250 --> 39:05.333
The home insurers
are going to start
to feel that

39:05.417 --> 39:08.709
they don't want to insure
homes in wildfire country.

39:09.208 --> 39:11.250
I think the average person
is going to have to make

39:11.333 --> 39:13.667
some different choices
about where they live,

39:13.750 --> 39:16.041
and probably not live...

39:16.583 --> 39:19.125
you know, in places
like Paradise.

39:20.917 --> 39:22.750
Are you going
to rebuild?

39:23.250 --> 39:24.625
No.

39:25.875 --> 39:28.750
I've never owned
a place.

39:30.417 --> 39:32.542
So I got to own a place

39:32.625 --> 39:34.750
for, um... a year.

39:35.792 --> 39:37.417
This place...

39:37.500 --> 39:40.625
is the loss of the world,
you know.

39:41.709 --> 39:45.875
I wish you could have
been here before.

39:45.959 --> 39:48.083
Because...

39:49.166 --> 39:52.125
it was an oasis.

39:57.583 --> 39:59.625
