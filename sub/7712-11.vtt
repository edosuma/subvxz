00:00.834 --> 00:02.770
UH-HUH.
NICE.

00:02.803 --> 00:04.472
OH, GOD.

00:04.505 --> 00:07.141
[giggles]

00:07.175 --> 00:08.509
WHAT'S WRONG, MICHAEL?

00:08.542 --> 00:10.678
I GOT GUM IN MY HAIR.

00:10.711 --> 00:11.779
YOU DO.

00:11.812 --> 00:14.048
THIS...JUST...STINKS.

00:14.082 --> 00:15.783
DON'T TOUCH IT.
PLEASE, DON'T TOUCH IT!

00:15.816 --> 00:17.118
YOU GOT A TON
OF DANDRUFF.

00:17.151 --> 00:17.918
OKAY, LET ME BE.

00:17.951 --> 00:18.919
HOW'D YOU GET GUM
IN YOUR HAIR?

00:18.952 --> 00:21.055
I WAS WALKING IN,
AND I NOTICED SOMETHING SHINY

00:21.089 --> 00:21.822
UNDER STANLEY'S CAR.

00:21.855 --> 00:23.791
AND I GOT UNDER TO SEE
WHAT IT WAS,

00:23.824 --> 00:26.160
AND I MESSED UP MY HAIR.

00:26.194 --> 00:27.795
ALL FOR A STUPID
PIECE OF TINFOIL.

00:27.828 --> 00:30.498
BUT, BEST-CASE SCENARIO,
YOU THOUGHT IT WAS A QUARTER.

00:30.531 --> 00:32.133
KILL ME.
RIGHT NOW.

00:32.166 --> 00:34.202
WE HAVE PEANUT BUTTER
IN THE KITCHEN.

00:34.235 --> 00:35.769
I DON'T FEEL
LIKE PEANUT BUTTER.

00:35.803 --> 00:37.205
GET ME AN ICE CREAM
SANDWICH.

00:37.238 --> 00:39.107
NOPE, NOT FOR YOU.
IT'S FOR YOUR HAIR.

00:39.140 --> 00:40.608
AND IT IS 9:00 A.M.

00:40.641 --> 00:42.310
NO, DWIGHT,

00:42.343 --> 00:44.278
NOT THE GOOD PEANUT BUTTER--
PEOPLE ARE GONNA GET MAD.

00:44.312 --> 00:45.446
HEY, HEY, HEY.

00:45.479 --> 00:47.148
THIS IS MY HAIR WE'RE
TALKING ABOUT.

00:49.383 --> 00:51.585
SMELLS GOOD.

00:51.619 --> 00:52.820
[smacks lips]
TASTES GOOD TOO.

00:52.853 --> 00:55.223
OH, DON'T.
THAT'S DISGUSTING.

00:55.256 --> 00:57.225
WOW, A LOT OF CALORIES.

00:57.258 --> 00:59.727
WELL, JUST DON'T LEAVE IT
ON TOO LONG.

00:59.760 --> 01:02.296
KEEP MASSAGING, PLEASE.

01:02.330 --> 01:05.399
OH, YEAH, THAT'S NICE.

01:05.433 --> 01:08.402
[cheerful music]

01:08.436 --> 01:16.444
*

01:39.933 --> 01:41.702
HEY, MICHAEL,
HOW WAS YOUR DATE LAST NIGHT?

01:41.735 --> 01:43.871
[big sigh]

01:43.904 --> 01:47.175
I WILL BE HONEST--THE DATING
HAS NOT BEEN GOING WELL.

01:47.208 --> 01:49.210
LOOK...

01:49.243 --> 01:51.312
MEN ARE VISUAL CREATURES.

01:51.345 --> 01:54.415
WE...CRAVE BEAUTY,

01:54.448 --> 01:59.387
LIKE A PIECE
OF FINE ART BY...

01:59.420 --> 02:01.855
ANY NUMBER
OF RENOWNED ARTISTS.

02:01.889 --> 02:05.859
OR AN ARTY PHOTOGRAPH

02:05.893 --> 02:07.728
OF CINDY CRAWFORD NUDE.

02:07.761 --> 02:10.798
THAT, BUT THE WOMEN
I'M GETTING FIXED UP WITH ARE...

02:10.831 --> 02:12.566
[gags]

02:12.600 --> 02:13.934
NOT THAT THEY AREN'T NICE

02:13.967 --> 02:17.505
OR THAT--
HAVE GREAT PERSONALITIES.

02:17.538 --> 02:20.641
THEY JUST--THEY JUST
LACK A CERTAIN...

02:20.674 --> 02:21.909
CRAWFORDNESS.

02:21.942 --> 02:24.878
I AM LIVID.
ABSOLUTELY LIVID.

02:24.912 --> 02:26.447
IT'S RIDICULOUS.

02:26.480 --> 02:27.881
YES, I'M HAVING
THE SCRANTON BRANCH

02:27.915 --> 02:29.483
COME IN ON ONE SATURDAY

02:29.517 --> 02:31.552
SO THEY CAN REENTER SALES
THAT THEY MADE ON THE PHONE

02:31.585 --> 02:32.953
AS SALES MADE BY THE WEBSITE,

02:32.986 --> 02:34.788
WHICH THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE
IN THE FIRST PLACE...

02:34.822 --> 02:36.657
IF THE WEBSITE
HAD BEEN WORKING.

02:36.690 --> 02:37.691
[door opens]

02:39.827 --> 02:41.529
MY FAVORITE BRANCH.

02:41.562 --> 02:42.830
HOW'S EVERYBODY DOING?

02:42.863 --> 02:44.798
HEY, MAN, YOU MIND IF I
RUN SOMETHING BY YOU?

02:44.832 --> 02:46.767
LOVE IT! GO.

02:46.800 --> 02:49.837
WELL, I KIND OF FEEL LIKE
WHAT WE HAVE GOING FOR US

02:49.870 --> 02:51.305
IS OUR CUSTOMER SERVICE.

02:51.339 --> 02:53.941
AND NO MATTER HOW MUCH
WE CHANGE THIS UP,

02:53.974 --> 02:56.444
I DON'T KNOW THAT A WEBSITE'S
GONNA BE ABLE TO REPLACE THAT.

02:56.477 --> 02:57.778
I CAN YOU'VE
THOUGHT ABOUT THIS A LOT.

02:57.811 --> 02:58.779
I APPRECIATE THAT.

02:58.812 --> 03:00.881
THANKS.
DAVID WALLACE DOES TOO.

03:00.914 --> 03:05.719
YOU TOLD HIM ALL ABOUT THIS
AT THE CHRISTMAS PARTY, RIGHT?

03:05.753 --> 03:06.754
I--I DON'T--

03:06.787 --> 03:08.256
YOU DID. YEAH.

03:08.289 --> 03:10.324
HMM.

03:10.358 --> 03:12.860
WATCH YOUR BACK, JIM.

03:12.893 --> 03:14.562
I'M JUST KIDDING.

03:17.998 --> 03:20.701
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MAY I
HAVE YOUR ATTENTION PLEASE?

03:20.734 --> 03:23.537
I KNOW THAT A LOT OF YOU
ARE VERY ANGRY WITH RYAN

03:23.571 --> 03:25.306
BECAUSE HE IS THE REASON WE ALL
HAVE TO COME IN TOMORROW.

03:25.339 --> 03:27.375
HOWEVER, I SWEAR TO GOD,

03:27.408 --> 03:31.011
IF ANY OF YOU HURTS HIM
IN ANY WAY, EMOTIONALLY,

03:31.044 --> 03:32.513
OR TAUNTS HIM

03:32.546 --> 03:36.284
OR MAKES FUN OF HIS HEIGHT
OR HIS HALF-BEARD--

03:36.317 --> 03:37.285
OKAY.
HE--

03:37.318 --> 03:38.586
THANKS, MICHAEL.
YEAH.

03:38.619 --> 03:41.489
I'M HERE TODAY TO DO SOME
CREATIVE PROBLEM SOLVING

03:41.522 --> 03:42.590
ABOUT DUNDER-MIFFLIN INFINITY

03:42.623 --> 03:43.857
AND FIELD YOUR QUESTIONS.

03:43.891 --> 03:45.593
QUESTION.
DWIGHT.

03:45.626 --> 03:46.694
WHY AM I BEING FORCED
TO COME IN TOMORROW

03:46.727 --> 03:49.263
AND PRETEND THAT A WEBSITE
MADE SALES THAT I MADE?

03:49.297 --> 03:50.731
THIS IS A TEMPORARY MEASURE

03:50.764 --> 03:52.300
TO INCREASE
THE LEGITIMACY OF THE SITE.

03:52.333 --> 03:53.834
I DON'T LIKE
WHEN MY CLIENTS CALL ME

03:53.867 --> 03:55.303
TO HELP THEM
USE THE WEBSITE.

03:55.336 --> 03:56.770
I'M NOT SEEING COMMISSIONS
ON THAT.

03:56.804 --> 03:58.972
I HEAR YOU, STANLEY.
THAT IS A GREAT OBSERVATION.

03:59.006 --> 04:01.509
PROBLEMS LIKE THAT
WILL NOT HAPPEN

04:01.542 --> 04:04.412
WHEN WE LAUNCH
DUNDER-MIFFLIN INFINITY 2.0.

04:04.445 --> 04:05.413
WHEN WILL THAT BE?

04:05.446 --> 04:06.680
TBD. PHYLLIS.

04:06.714 --> 04:08.749
DID THE POLICE
SOLVE THE PROBLEM WITH--

04:08.782 --> 04:10.684
YES, YES, THEY DID.
YES, THEY DID.

04:10.718 --> 04:13.053
YES, THE SOCIAL NETWORKING
FEATURE

04:13.086 --> 04:14.855
OF THE DUNDER-MIFFLIN
INFINITY WEBSITE

04:14.888 --> 04:17.758
WAS INFILTRATED
BY SEXUAL PREDATORS.

04:17.791 --> 04:18.992
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY OUR WEBSITE

04:19.026 --> 04:20.528
NEEDS TO HAVE
SOCIAL NETWORKING AT ALL.

04:20.561 --> 04:22.463
YEAH, I ACTUALLY HAVE TO
AGREE WITH DWIGHT ON THAT ONE.

04:22.496 --> 04:25.966
IT'S ALL ABOUT CREATING
A ONE-STOP CONSUMER EXPERIENCE.

04:25.999 --> 04:27.868
ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE CHATTING
WITH YOUR FRIENDS.

04:27.901 --> 04:29.803
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
THE LATEST MUSIC.

04:29.837 --> 04:30.838
ABOUT THE ELECTION.

04:30.871 --> 04:35.075
ALL OF IT IS HAPPENING
IN OUR VIRTUAL PAPER STORE.

04:35.108 --> 04:37.845
AND THEN AN OLDER GENTLEMAN
ASKS YOU, "BOXERS OR BRIEFS?"

04:37.878 --> 04:39.413
I DON'T GET
THE BIG FUSS HERE.

04:39.447 --> 04:40.748
I LIKE THE SITE.

04:40.781 --> 04:42.516
IF I HAD CREATED A WEBSITE
WITH THIS MANY PROBLEMS,

04:42.550 --> 04:43.784
I'D KILL MYSELF.

04:43.817 --> 04:44.885
DO YOU HAVE QUESTION,
KELLY?

04:44.918 --> 04:46.387
YEAH, I HAVE
A LOT OF QUESTIONS.

04:46.420 --> 04:48.656
NUMBER ONE: HOW DARE YOU?

04:51.492 --> 04:53.060
RYAN HAS DONE
A VERY GOOD JOB.

04:53.093 --> 04:56.630
AND I AM NOT APPLAUDING
SARCASTICALLY.

04:56.664 --> 04:57.931
THINK ABOUT IT.

04:57.965 --> 05:00.334
A MONTH AGO,
NOBODY WOULD GO ON THIS SITE

05:00.368 --> 05:01.369
BECAUSE WE WERE WORRIED

05:01.402 --> 05:02.336
ABOUT GETTING MOLESTED

05:02.370 --> 05:05.506
OR LOSING OUR IDENTITY,
HAVING IT STOLEN.

05:05.539 --> 05:07.007
BUT NOW,

05:07.040 --> 05:09.777
AT A TIME TDB,

05:09.810 --> 05:12.346
ALL OF THESE PROBLEMS
WILL BE IN THE PAST.

05:12.380 --> 05:13.781
YOU DONE GOOD, KID.

05:13.814 --> 05:15.082
YOU DONE GOOD.

05:19.420 --> 05:21.789
WELL, IT HAS BEEN NICE
SEEING YOU AGAIN, MY FRIEND.

05:21.822 --> 05:23.023
YOU TOO.

05:23.056 --> 05:24.825
OH!
[grunting]

05:24.858 --> 05:27.395
OH, RYAN, I NEED
A GIRLFRIEND SO BAD.

05:27.428 --> 05:28.662
MICHAEL, LET ME GO.

05:28.696 --> 05:29.863
LET ME GO, MICHAEL.
[grunting]

05:29.897 --> 05:31.665
ALL RIGHT.

05:31.699 --> 05:33.033
DO YOU KNOW ANY GIRLS
IN NEW YORK

05:33.066 --> 05:35.002
YOU MIGHT...
WANNA HOOK ME UP WITH?

05:35.035 --> 05:38.105
THAT MIGHT BE INTERESTED
IN A GUY LIKE ME?

05:38.138 --> 05:39.740
NAH.
NAH.

05:39.773 --> 05:41.575
SORRY, MAN.
WELL, YOU TRIED.

05:41.609 --> 05:42.876
BUT, SERIOUSLY,

05:42.910 --> 05:44.745
YOU SHOULD SEE THE GIRLS
I MEET AT CLUBS IN THE CITY.

05:44.778 --> 05:45.746
YEAH.

05:45.779 --> 05:48.148
UNREAL.
THEY SOUND GREAT.

05:48.181 --> 05:50.083
BYE, EVERYONE.

05:50.117 --> 05:51.852
STAY REAL, SCRANTON,
ALL RIGHT?

05:51.885 --> 05:54.021
PEACE!

05:55.556 --> 05:56.924
WOULD YOU HAVE SEX
WITH MEREDITH?

05:56.957 --> 05:57.958
WHAT?

05:57.991 --> 05:59.026
DO YOU THINK
SHE'D KEEP IT QUIET?

05:59.059 --> 06:01.429
I'M GONNA GO
TO MY DESK.

06:01.462 --> 06:03.063
JIM, IT'S NOT
THE HORNINESS, OKAY?

06:03.096 --> 06:04.865
IT'S THE LONELINESS.
THAT'S--

06:04.898 --> 06:06.099
I KNOW.

06:06.133 --> 06:07.568
LET'S GO TO NEW YORK.

06:07.601 --> 06:08.869
WE'LL GO CLUBBING
WITH RYAN.

06:08.902 --> 06:10.170
I CAN'T.
YES, YOU CAN.

06:10.203 --> 06:11.939
YOU'RE SINGLE, I'M SINGLE.
IT'LL BE AWESOME.

06:11.972 --> 06:12.940
I'M NOT SINGLE.

06:12.973 --> 06:15.008
WHO ARE YOU DATING?

06:15.042 --> 06:16.043
PAM.

06:16.076 --> 06:17.077
THAT'S STILL GOING ON?

06:17.110 --> 06:18.946
[sighs]

06:21.214 --> 06:22.950
OKAY, DWIGHT,
GRAB YOUR STUFF.

06:22.983 --> 06:25.419
WE'RE GOING TO NEW YORK TO PARTY
WITH RYAN AND TO MEET GIRLS.

06:25.453 --> 06:26.954
YEAH!
OH, YES.

06:26.987 --> 06:28.822
COUNT ME IN, DUDES.

06:28.856 --> 06:31.525
I AM IN SERIOUS NEED
OF SOME PRUNE TIME!

06:31.559 --> 06:32.926
OLD BALL AND CHAIN'S

06:32.960 --> 06:34.995
BEEN A LOT MORE CHAIN
THAN BALL LATELY,

06:35.028 --> 06:36.196
IF YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M SAYING.

06:36.229 --> 06:36.997
I'M RIGHT HERE.

06:37.030 --> 06:39.500
NO. SINGLES ONLY.
SINGLES ONLY.

06:39.533 --> 06:41.569
ALSO, THREE IS UNLUCKY.

06:41.602 --> 06:42.570
CURSE OF THREE.

06:42.603 --> 06:44.605
SORRY, ANDY, CANNOT TAKE
ANY CHANCES ON CURSES.

06:44.638 --> 06:45.839
NOT TONIGHT.
LET'S GO.

06:45.873 --> 06:48.642
EVERYBODY, I WILL SEE YOU
TOMORROW, SATURDAY MORNING.

06:48.676 --> 06:49.977
PROBABLY WEARING
THE SAME CLOTHES

06:50.010 --> 06:51.779
THAT I'M WEARING
RIGHT NOW...

06:51.812 --> 06:53.947
IF YOU CATCH MY DRIFT.

06:53.981 --> 06:55.048
WE GET IT.

06:55.082 --> 06:58.786
I AM GOING...
TO GO GET LAID.

06:58.819 --> 07:00.187
GOOD-BYE!

07:00.220 --> 07:02.456
WITH SEX!

07:02.490 --> 07:04.224
(Michael)
THAT'S--I NE--
I TAKE, UH...

07:04.257 --> 07:05.158
YOU KNOW WHAT?

07:05.192 --> 07:06.827
IF WE ALL STAYED
A COUPLE HOURS LATE TONIGHT

07:06.860 --> 07:07.761
WITHOUT MICHAEL
DISTRACTING US,

07:07.795 --> 07:09.997
WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO COME IN
AT ALL TOMORROW.

07:12.165 --> 07:13.534
SO I CAUGHT EVERYONE
BEFORE THEY LEFT,

07:13.567 --> 07:15.135
AND I TOLD THEM MY IDEA.

07:15.168 --> 07:16.203
AND THEY LOVED IT.

07:16.236 --> 07:20.207
BECAUSE THIS IS A GROUP
THAT RESPECTS GOOD IDEAS.

07:20.240 --> 07:23.010
THE ONE TIME A YEAR
THEY HEAR ONE.

07:23.043 --> 07:25.012
[traffic noise]

07:25.045 --> 07:27.681
RYAN'S ASSISTANT TOLD US

07:27.715 --> 07:30.751
THAT HE WOULD BE
AT THIS CLUB THIS EVENING.

07:30.784 --> 07:32.152
IT IS CALLED PREROGATIVE.

07:32.185 --> 07:35.155
[pumping dance music]

07:35.188 --> 07:36.657
*

07:36.690 --> 07:38.759
(Michael)
THIS PLACE IS PACKED!

07:38.792 --> 07:39.860
FIRE HAZARD.

07:39.893 --> 07:43.831
PACKED WITH...
BEAUTIFUL BABIES.

07:43.864 --> 07:46.867
SWINGERS.
CLASSIC.

07:46.900 --> 07:50.638
JOHN FAVREAU, TALL GUY
FROM DODGEBALL.

07:50.671 --> 07:52.272
THESE WOMEN LOOK
LIKE WHITE SLAVES.

07:52.305 --> 07:53.941
(Michael)
NO, THEY'RE JUST HOT.
HOTTIES.

07:53.974 --> 07:56.109
I DON'T KNOW, MAN, I MEAN,
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT,

07:56.143 --> 07:57.811
CABO IS REALLY
THE THIRD WORLD.

07:57.845 --> 08:00.180
I DON'T GO TO A PLACE
LIKE THAT TO SEE MORE POVERTY.

08:00.213 --> 08:01.815
YOU KNOW, YOU GO THERE
TO GET SOME GLAMOUR.

08:01.849 --> 08:02.816
HEY.

08:02.850 --> 08:03.851
MICHAEL?!

08:03.884 --> 08:05.919
HEY!

DOING HERE?

08:05.953 --> 08:07.588
WELL, YOU KNOW, JUST

08:07.621 --> 08:08.722

08:10.290 --> 08:11.992
THAT IS SO AWESOME, MAN!

08:12.025 --> 08:13.026

08:15.028 --> 08:16.029
YEAH!

08:16.063 --> 08:18.899
OHH!

08:18.932 --> 08:20.868
RYAN, IT'S MICHAEL
AND DWIGHT!

08:20.901 --> 08:22.302
I KNOW IT'S YOU GUYS!
OKAY.

08:22.335 --> 08:24.037
I'M SO PSYCHED
YOU'RE HERE!

08:24.071 --> 08:25.539
WELL...

08:25.573 --> 08:27.040
ALL RIGHT!

08:27.074 --> 08:29.076
LET'S GET A DRINK!
LET'S DO IT!

08:35.015 --> 08:36.249
(Jim)
THANKS A LOT, GUYS!

08:36.283 --> 08:37.918
GOOD JOB!

08:40.821 --> 08:41.922
LATER.

08:41.955 --> 08:43.256
NICE JOB, EVERYBODY.

08:43.290 --> 08:45.092
GREAT WORK.

08:50.297 --> 08:53.901
DID YOU NOT TELL THE SECURITY
GUARD WE WERE WORKING LATE?

08:53.934 --> 08:55.736
NOPE.

08:55.769 --> 08:57.104
I DIDN'T.

08:57.137 --> 08:58.238
BUT LET'S GO INSIDE.

08:58.271 --> 09:00.007
AND I CAN CALL HIM
RIGHT NOW.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.041
WE CAN'T.

09:01.074 --> 09:02.876
I LOCKED THE OFFICE
FROM THE INSIDE WHEN WE LEFT.

09:02.910 --> 09:03.677
PERFECT.

09:03.711 --> 09:05.779
YOU GUYS WORKED TOGETHER
ON THIS ONE.

09:05.813 --> 09:08.281
IF I'M NOT IN MY BATH
WITH A GLASS OF RED WINE

09:08.315 --> 09:10.751
IN ONE HOUR,
YOU'RE BOTH DEAD.

09:14.321 --> 09:18.225
THERE IS A MASTER KEY
AND A SPARE KEY FOR THE OFFICE.

09:18.258 --> 09:20.027
DWIGHT HAS THEM BOTH.

09:20.060 --> 09:22.229
WHEN I ASKED,
"WHAT IF YOU DIE, DWIGHT?

09:22.262 --> 09:24.097
HOW WILL WE
GET INTO THE OFFICE?"

09:24.131 --> 09:28.201
HE SAID, "IF I'M DEAD, YOU GUYS
HAVE BEEN DEAD FOR WEEKS."

09:28.235 --> 09:30.838
GUYS, I WANT YOU TO MEET
A REALLY GOOD FRIEND OF MINE.

09:30.871 --> 09:31.872
THIS IS TROY.

09:31.905 --> 09:32.906
HEY, NICE
TO MEET YOU.

09:32.940 --> 09:33.907
HOW YOU DOING?

09:33.941 --> 09:35.876
HI. DWIGHT.

09:35.909 --> 09:37.144
YOU RESEMBLE
A TOLKIEN CHARACTER.

09:37.177 --> 09:39.279
UH, HE BASICALLY IS,
MAN.

09:39.312 --> 09:40.848
HE'S A REGULAR
BANKING WIZARD.

09:40.881 --> 09:41.849
NO, NO, NO,
NOT A WIZARD.

09:41.882 --> 09:42.950
A HOBBIT.

09:44.317 --> 09:45.318
BOTTLE SERVICE HERE.

09:45.352 --> 09:46.854
(Michael)
OH! OKAY.

09:46.887 --> 09:48.088
ALL I KNOW IS

09:48.121 --> 09:49.990
I WOULD LIKE
SOME CHICKEN FINGERS

09:50.023 --> 09:51.124
AND A MIDORI SOUR.

09:51.158 --> 09:52.960
WE DON'T SERVE
FOOD HERE.

09:52.993 --> 09:53.961
OH, OKAY.

09:53.994 --> 09:56.063
THEN JUST BRING ME
TWO CUPS.

09:56.096 --> 09:57.898
ONE WITH OLIVES,

09:57.931 --> 10:00.200
AND ANOTHER ONE FILLED
WITH MARASCHINO CHERRIES.

10:02.169 --> 10:03.771
DO YOU LIVE
IN A REGULAR-SIZED HOUSE?

10:03.804 --> 10:06.239
YEAH, HE'S A NORMAL GUY.

10:06.273 --> 10:07.074
HE'S COOL.

10:07.107 --> 10:09.142
YOU REALLY DON'T
HAVE HIS PHONE NUMBER?

10:09.176 --> 10:11.244
I TOLD YOU I HAVE
THE NUMBER THAT RINGS HERE.

10:11.278 --> 10:12.412
DO YOU WANT THAT NUMBER?

10:12.445 --> 10:14.281
I MIGHT HAVE IT
IN HERE.

10:14.314 --> 10:16.116
WOW, THAT'S GREAT,
TOBY.

10:16.149 --> 10:18.051
IT'S SO RANDOM
THAT I HAVE IT.

10:18.085 --> 10:19.252
TOBY, YOU'RE THE BEST!

10:19.286 --> 10:21.421
WHEN I PUT IT IN, I THOUGHT
IT MIGHT BE A WASTE OF TIME,

10:21.454 --> 10:22.890
BUT I THINK
IT WAS WORTH IT.

10:22.923 --> 10:25.292
GREAT. IT'S UNDER HERE
AS "SECURITY GUARD - HOME."

10:25.325 --> 10:26.794
DID YOU NOT
GET HIS NAME OR--

10:26.827 --> 10:28.161
NO.

10:28.195 --> 10:29.730
IT'S RINGING--DOES ANYBODY
HAVE HIS NAME, QUICK?

10:29.763 --> 10:30.798
YES, IT'S EDDIE.

10:30.831 --> 10:31.999
IT'S NOT--
IT'S NOT EDDIE.

10:32.032 --> 10:33.133
IT'S EVAN OR--

10:33.166 --> 10:34.702
HANK.
HIS NAME IS HANK.

10:34.735 --> 10:36.236
NO, GUYS, HIS NAME
IS NOT HANK, IT'S, UH...

10:36.269 --> 10:37.237
IS IT EDGAR?

10:37.270 --> 10:38.205
ELLIOT.

10:38.238 --> 10:41.241

10:41.274 --> 10:44.244
THIS IS, UH, JIM HALPERT
FROM, UM, WHERE YOU WORK.

10:44.277 --> 10:47.414

BEHIND THE DESK.

10:47.447 --> 10:50.718
YOU'RE THE--THE AF--

10:50.751 --> 10:51.752
AFRICAN-AMERICAN GUY.

10:51.785 --> 10:53.386
I MEAN, YOU'RE, UH...

10:53.420 --> 10:55.455

10:57.390 --> 10:58.759
HOW'S SCHRUTE FARMS?

10:58.792 --> 11:00.127
GOOD.

11:00.160 --> 11:01.829
THIS GUY OWNS
HIS OWN BEET FARM.

11:01.862 --> 11:03.163
INSANE!

11:03.196 --> 11:05.165
WELL, IT'S WEEVIL SEASON,
BUT WE WERE PREPARED.

11:05.198 --> 11:08.201
WEEVILS.
WHAT A CRAZY WORD, MAN.

11:08.235 --> 11:09.436
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS.

11:09.469 --> 11:11.071
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

11:11.104 --> 11:13.106
THEY LAY THEIR EGGS INSIDE
THE UNRIPE BEET ROOT,

11:13.140 --> 11:14.174
THEN, COME SPRINGTIME,

11:14.207 --> 11:15.242
THE BABIES EAT THEIR WAY OUT.

11:15.275 --> 11:17.277
CRAZY!
CRAZY!

11:17.310 --> 11:19.146
THAT'S TOO MUCH
FOR ME, MAN.

11:19.179 --> 11:20.280
I'M GONNA HEAD
TO THE BATHROOM.

11:20.313 --> 11:21.815
YOU'VE ALREADY BEEN
SEVERAL TIMES.

11:21.849 --> 11:23.216
YEAH?

11:23.250 --> 11:24.818
MAYBE YOU HAVE SOME KIND
OF BLADDER INFECTION.

11:24.852 --> 11:25.986
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE.

11:26.019 --> 11:28.188
I'LL ORDER YOU
SOME CRANBERRY JUICE!

11:28.221 --> 11:29.389
WITH VODKA.
YOU'RE THE BEST!

11:31.458 --> 11:33.326
DO YOU HAVE POWERS?

11:33.360 --> 11:34.862
OH, THANK YOU, HANK.

11:34.895 --> 11:37.264
YOU ARE A LIFESAVER,
HANK.

11:37.297 --> 11:38.231
APPRECIATE IT.

11:38.265 --> 11:40.300
ALL RIGHT, SO HANK
IS GOING TO COME DOWN HERE.

11:40.333 --> 11:41.168
HE'S GONNA LET US ALL OUT.

11:41.201 --> 11:43.103
HE SAID IT SHOULD BE
JUST UNDER AN HOUR.

11:43.136 --> 11:44.171
SO...
[all groan]

11:44.204 --> 11:45.839
WE DID IT.

11:45.873 --> 11:47.140
WE SHOULD ALL MAKE SURE

11:47.174 --> 11:48.976
TO GIVE HIM A BIG TIP
THIS CHRISTMAS.

11:49.009 --> 11:52.145
SORRY, GUYS, BUT I DON'T THINK
I TIPPED HIM FOR LAST YEAR'S.

11:52.179 --> 11:54.047
NEITHER DID I.

11:54.081 --> 11:56.149
JIM WAS SUPPOSED
TO COLLECT IT.

11:57.284 --> 11:58.351
YEP.

11:58.385 --> 12:00.153
WAY TO GO, MAN.

12:00.187 --> 12:00.954
NOW HE'S NEVER
GONNA COME.

12:00.988 --> 12:02.489
BY SHOW OF HANDS,
WHO THINKS WE'RE

12:02.522 --> 12:04.257
A BETTER COUPLE
THAN JIM AND PAM?

12:07.895 --> 12:09.162
PHYLLIS.

12:11.264 --> 12:13.266
I, UM, THOUGHT ABOUT

12:13.300 --> 12:15.502
GETTING A TATTOO ON MY BACK
AS WELL AT ONE POINT.

12:15.535 --> 12:18.105
I WAS THINKING ABOUT
GETTING BACK TO THE FUTURE.

12:18.138 --> 12:20.908
"BACK" BECAUSE
IT'S ON MY BACK.

12:20.941 --> 12:23.043
AND FUTURE BECAUSE
I'M THE KIND OF GUY

12:23.076 --> 12:25.245
WHO LIKES TO LOOK AHEAD
INTO THE FUTURE.

12:25.278 --> 12:28.048
I JUST THINK A TATTOO
SHOULD MEAN SOMETHING.

12:28.081 --> 12:29.182
YOU KNOW?

12:29.216 --> 12:30.417
AND IT'S
MY SECOND-FAVORITE MOVIE.

12:30.450 --> 12:32.219
I'VE NEVER HEARD
OF THAT MOVIE.

12:32.252 --> 12:34.087
BACK TO THE FUTURE ?!

12:34.121 --> 12:35.789
OH! WOW!

12:35.823 --> 12:38.225
WELL, YOU SHOULD
TAKE A FILM EDUCATION COURSE.

12:38.258 --> 12:39.559
HOW OLD ARE YOU?

12:39.592 --> 12:41.795
40--I'M IN MY 40s.

12:41.829 --> 12:43.330
WOW.
[giggles]

12:43.363 --> 12:44.898
THAT'S SO COOL.

12:44.932 --> 12:46.066
[laughs nervously]
YEAH.

12:46.099 --> 12:48.335
WELL, I'M GONNA GO BACK
TO MY GROUP NOW.

12:48.368 --> 12:49.336
OH, OKAY.

12:49.369 --> 12:50.570
THANKS FOR THE DRINK.

12:50.603 --> 12:52.372
YOU ARE WELCOME.
MM...

12:57.210 --> 12:58.445
THIS PLACE IS LIKE A--

12:58.478 --> 12:59.980
LIKE A SEXY PRESCHOOL.

13:00.013 --> 13:01.581
DID YOU WANT A PLACE WHERE
WE CAN MEET OLDER WOMEN?

13:01.614 --> 13:04.184
I WOULD LOVE A PLACE WHERE
WE COULD MEET OLDER GIRLS.

13:04.217 --> 13:06.019
HELL, YEAH!

13:06.053 --> 13:07.520
I'LL HOOK IT UP.

13:07.554 --> 13:10.323
[glass shatters]
AHH, WOW.
THAT'S DANGEROUS.

13:18.365 --> 13:19.967
EXCUSE ME.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.201
YEAH?

13:21.234 --> 13:23.236
HOW DID YOU ALL
FIND EACH OTHER?

13:23.270 --> 13:25.605
UH, WE'RE THE JERSEY STATE
VARSITY BASKETBALL TEAM.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.140

WHOO!

13:29.910 --> 13:32.579
AMAZONS.

13:32.612 --> 13:34.181
IT'S OFF.
IT'S NOT THE DUDE I KNOW.

13:34.214 --> 13:35.348
IT'S SOME OTHER LOSER

13:35.382 --> 13:36.984
WHO WON'T LET US IN
WITHOUT CHICKS.

13:37.017 --> 13:38.218
YOU'RE KIDDING ME.
LET'S BAIL.

13:38.251 --> 13:39.486
HEY, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

13:39.519 --> 13:41.454

13:43.523 --> 13:45.258
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
FINE.

13:45.292 --> 13:46.193
LET'S GO TWO GIRLS

13:46.226 --> 13:47.327
COME ON, LET'S DO IT.

13:47.360 --> 13:49.262
COME ON, RYAN.

13:49.296 --> 13:50.898
OKAY, THREE OR FOUR

13:50.931 --> 13:51.932
LET'S GO.
COME ON.

13:51.965 --> 13:54.267
HERE WE GO.
DON'T STEP ON HIM.

13:56.403 --> 13:58.638
HEY, LOOK WHAT I FOUND

13:58.671 --> 14:00.240
WANNA PLAY?
I'LL TEACH YOU TO THROW.

14:00.273 --> 14:01.574
I KNOW HOW

14:01.608 --> 14:02.943
AH, OF COURSE YOU DO.

14:02.976 --> 14:05.178

14:13.586 --> 14:14.955
WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT IS THIS?

14:14.988 --> 14:16.089
I DIDN'T ORDER THIS.

14:16.123 --> 14:18.091
IT'S FOR YOU.
FROM THEM.

14:18.125 --> 14:19.592
(Dwight)
OH.

14:23.363 --> 14:24.898
(Troy)
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, MAN?

14:24.932 --> 14:25.899
IT'S NOT SAFE.

14:25.933 --> 14:27.267
ANYTHING COULD HAVE
BEEN IN THERE.

14:27.300 --> 14:29.169
NICE TRY!

14:29.202 --> 14:31.038
I'VE NEVER MET ANYBODY
WHO DOES THAT.

14:31.071 --> 14:33.040
YOU WASH DOGS?
VERY COOL.

14:33.073 --> 14:35.142
THAT'S ONE ASPECT

14:35.175 --> 14:36.143
WHAT DO YOU DO?

14:36.176 --> 14:37.344

14:37.377 --> 14:41.114
RYAN TOLD ME TO ALWAYS TELL
A WOMAN YOU WORK IN FINANCE.

ALL RIGHT.

15:22.655 --> 15:25.025
I DON'T WANNA GET

15:25.058 --> 15:27.294
I THINK I WANT HER

15:27.327 --> 15:28.395
HEY, MAN...

15:28.428 --> 15:29.629
YOU EVER THINK
THERE'S GONNA BE

15:29.662 --> 15:31.398
THIS MASSIVE
NUCLEAR HOLOCAUST?

15:31.431 --> 15:33.266
AND AFTER ALL THE MAJOR
NATIONS ARE DESTROYED,

15:33.300 --> 15:34.968
THERE'LL JUST BE THE TRIBES

15:35.002 --> 15:36.336

15:36.369 --> 15:38.271

15:40.073 --> 15:41.208
YEAH, MAYBE.

15:50.217 --> 15:53.520

OH, MY GOD.

16:29.056 --> 16:30.557
ONE OF MY FRIENDS IS GETTING
BEATEN UP BY SOME GIRLS!

16:31.391 --> 16:33.226
ACTUALLY,
IT'S KIND OF TOO BAD

16:33.260 --> 16:34.627
WE'RE NOT COMING IN
TO WORK TOMORROW.

16:34.661 --> 16:35.662
(Troy)

19:04.744 --> 19:06.813

19:06.846 --> 19:10.750

MY FRIEND TROY

19:10.783 --> 19:13.253
MIGHT HAVE
A DRUG PROBLEM.

19:13.286 --> 19:14.721
WHAT DO I DO?

19:14.754 --> 19:16.289
I THINK HIS SPECIES

19:16.323 --> 19:17.824
MIGHT HAVE A HIGHER
TOLERANCE THAN OURS.

19:17.857 --> 19:20.693
SH, JUST...STOP.

19:20.727 --> 19:22.929
HERE'S WHAT YOU DO.

19:22.962 --> 19:25.798
YOU TELL HIM THAT
YOU'RE HIS FRIEND,

19:25.832 --> 19:27.667
AND THAT YOU'RE
GOING TO HELP HIM,

19:27.700 --> 19:29.636
AND THAT EVERYTHING'S
GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.

19:31.638 --> 19:34.274
AND THEN YOU
PUT A WIRE ON HIM...

19:34.307 --> 19:37.444
AND YOU FIND OUT
WHO'S SELLING HIM...DRUGS.

19:37.477 --> 19:40.313
AND THEN YOU GET THAT GUY
AND YOU FLIP HIM.

19:40.347 --> 19:41.514
YOU TURN HIM
INTO A SNITCH.

19:41.548 --> 19:43.650
YOU FOLLOW THAT GUY...

19:43.683 --> 19:46.753
TO THE PEOPLE
REALLY, REALLY BAD.

19:46.786 --> 19:47.987
BEEN WATCHING THE WIRE
RECENTLY.

19:48.020 --> 19:49.656
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
A WORD OF IT.

19:49.689 --> 19:51.358
(Ryan)
YOU GUYS, I'M GOING TO SLEEP.

19:51.391 --> 19:52.792
YOU CAN LEAVE THE LIGHT ON
IF YOU WANT,

19:52.825 --> 19:53.993
BUT PLEASE STOP TALKING,
OKAY?

19:54.026 --> 19:55.662

GOOD NIGHT, RYAN.

19:57.264 --> 19:58.465
GOOD NIGHT, RYAN.

20:01.734 --> 20:03.703
[whispering]
BEST NIGHT EVER.

20:03.736 --> 20:06.439
LIKE I SAID,
IT'S NOT ABOUT THE HORNINESS.

20:06.473 --> 20:08.475
IT'S ABOUT THE LONELINESS.

20:08.508 --> 20:11.744
AND HOW CAN I BE ALONE HERE
WITH MY BOYS?

20:11.778 --> 20:14.714
LIKE A...FAMOUS PERSON
ONCE SAID,

20:14.747 --> 20:16.583
BOYS ON THE SIDE.

20:16.616 --> 20:17.817
BUT I DON'T--
I DISAGREE.

20:17.850 --> 20:19.852
I SAY, LET'S HEAR IT
FOR THE BOYS.

20:28.628 --> 20:30.863
[car door opening]

20:36.436 --> 20:37.970
SON OF A BITCH.
