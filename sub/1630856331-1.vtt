00:54.184 --> 00:56.882
In the early morning hours,
today, federal agents from the

00:57.057 --> 01:01.278
ATF, the DEA, and the FBI all
converged on the Beverly Hills

01:01.452 --> 01:04.281
estate of alleged crime boss,
Jacob Hadar.

01:04.455 --> 01:07.676
A brutal end to this undercover operation.

01:07.850 --> 01:11.506
Hadar, the suspected west coast
head of the Israeli Mafia,

01:11.680 --> 01:15.292
has been under federal
investigation for over two years

01:15.466 --> 01:18.295
for crimes ranging
from racketeering, to murder,

01:18.469 --> 01:20.428
to trafficking in nuclear warheads.

01:21.124 --> 01:22.778
Reportedly, Hadar immigrated to

01:22.952 --> 01:26.303
the Brighton Beach area of
New York at the age of fifteen,

01:26.477 --> 01:28.479
after losing both parents to
military strikes

01:28.653 --> 01:30.090
in the Gaza Strip.

01:30.742 --> 01:32.266
While living in New York,

01:32.440 --> 01:34.790
Hadar honed his talents for
numbers and extortion,

01:34.964 --> 01:38.228
working for purported Russian
crime lord, Viktor Ivanov.

01:39.055 --> 01:42.232
Ivanov's close ties to Russian
president and other known

01:42.406 --> 01:44.278
ex-KGB operatives,

01:44.452 --> 01:47.150
has kept him on the US intelligence radar.

01:48.151 --> 01:51.067
With the help of fellow crime
figure, Yaniv Kafni,

01:51.241 --> 01:53.287
Hadar moved quickly
up the ranks of an offshoot

01:53.461 --> 01:56.812
organization, calling themselves
the Israeli mob.

01:58.118 --> 02:01.469
Establishing a west
coast presence, Hadar and Kafni

02:01.643 --> 02:04.124
worked to create lucrative
narcotics connections

02:04.298 --> 02:07.344
with cartel kingpin,
Guzman Alvarez.

02:08.040 --> 02:10.652
With Alvarez's backing and his
own growing wealth

02:10.826 --> 02:14.569
and influence, Hadar entered the
black market arms game.

02:15.483 --> 02:18.616
Statistics indicate that since 1997,

02:18.790 --> 02:21.532
over twenty nuclear missiles
from the former Soviet Union

02:21.706 --> 02:23.969
have gone loose.

02:24.709 --> 02:27.190
Our sources indicate that Jacob
Hadar and his associates

02:27.364 --> 02:30.062
are being implicated in their
disappearance.

02:46.731 --> 02:47.950
So when is Hanna due?

02:48.124 --> 02:49.343
In three months.

02:49.517 --> 02:50.518
Getting nervous?

02:51.519 --> 02:53.042
Having a baby, I can handle.

02:53.216 --> 02:55.305
Getting wired makes me nervous.

02:58.221 --> 02:59.701
So that's your frame.

02:59.875 --> 03:01.659
At six feet, we're seeing
about eight feet wide.

03:02.878 --> 03:04.967
So, Eli, talk.
I want to get your audio levels.

03:05.315 --> 03:07.317
One, two, three.

03:07.752 --> 03:10.277
Test. Test.

03:10.451 --> 03:12.192
No, say something conversational.

03:12.583 --> 03:14.411
If they find out
I'm making movies...

03:14.585 --> 03:16.283
they'll chop me into little pieces.

03:17.806 --> 03:19.329
Crystal clear.

03:20.025 --> 03:22.202
The better to hear my screams.

03:24.247 --> 03:25.683
It's totally undetectable.

03:25.857 --> 03:27.381
They can wand you, run you
through an X-ray,

03:27.555 --> 03:29.513
they'll never find it.

03:29.687 --> 03:31.211
So you can sit back and
enjoy your cavity search.

03:36.694 --> 03:38.348
Hey, there's nothing to worry about.

03:49.838 --> 03:51.274
How you doing, Eli?

03:59.804 --> 04:01.502
On the stairs is
Alejandro Cortez,

04:01.676 --> 04:03.373
the cartel's east coast guy.

04:06.028 --> 04:09.031
The Hawaiian shirt is county
treasurer, Peter Vanguard.

04:11.773 --> 04:14.515
I used to watch
a lot of American television.

04:14.689 --> 04:17.561
And one program I liked
to watch was Superman.

04:18.693 --> 04:19.998
Hola, muchacha.

04:21.652 --> 04:22.914
And Superman... Gracias...
Could do anything.

04:24.481 --> 04:27.136
He could jump, he could fly,
he could beat the bullets.

04:28.355 --> 04:30.705
So one time, he had stopped a bank robber.

04:30.966 --> 04:33.882
And the bank robber shoot him.
Bang! Bang! Bang!

04:34.056 --> 04:36.058
And the bullets
they just bounce off the chest.

04:37.102 --> 04:40.105
Okay, listen.
So he out of bullets...

04:40.280 --> 04:42.238
and he throw the gun at Superman...

04:42.412 --> 04:44.153
And Superman duck!

04:46.851 --> 04:48.810
So remember this about Americans...

04:48.984 --> 04:50.986
They may be bulletproof, but...

04:51.160 --> 04:53.118
you can always pistol whip them.

05:01.562 --> 05:03.172
Jacob, you must be Superman.

05:03.346 --> 05:06.218
Whoa, whoa.
What he talking about?

05:07.350 --> 05:09.221
Tell Hugo about you getting shot.

05:09.396 --> 05:11.049
- Nah...
- Ah, you've been shot?

05:11.223 --> 05:12.964
Me too. Mira.

05:13.138 --> 05:14.270
Shot in my collarbone.

05:14.444 --> 05:17.404
- Aww...
- Oh...Very painful.

05:18.143 --> 05:19.493
- Tell him, Jacob.
- Well...

05:19.667 --> 05:21.146
Don't be shy.

05:21.321 --> 05:23.410
I suppose the bullets,
they just, pew, pew, pew!

05:23.584 --> 05:24.976
Bouncing off the chest. Ha!

05:25.150 --> 05:26.369
I was shot seven times.

05:26.543 --> 05:27.544
Seven times?

05:28.197 --> 05:31.026
You are Superman.
Ha ha ha!

05:31.200 --> 05:32.244
Tell him the whole story.

05:32.419 --> 05:33.637
I was ambushed.

05:33.811 --> 05:35.335
Betrayed by a business associate.

05:35.509 --> 05:36.684
Well, you must be very careful

05:36.858 --> 05:37.859
who you do business with.

05:38.860 --> 05:40.296
So, there was this big gun battle

05:40.470 --> 05:41.776
and Jacob was hit and out of ammo, and the

05:41.950 --> 05:42.820
gutless dog who was trying to...

05:42.994 --> 05:44.605
He wasn't gutless.

05:44.779 --> 05:46.955
He walked up right to me
and looked me in the eye.

05:47.129 --> 05:49.697
Oh, this is exciting.

05:49.871 --> 05:51.176
Did you say something to him?

05:51.351 --> 05:52.787
I did. Every time he shot me, I said,

05:52.961 --> 05:53.788
I fucked your mama!

05:53.962 --> 05:55.659
Oh no! Ha Ha!

05:59.054 --> 06:00.403
So, he walked closer and bang!

06:00.577 --> 06:01.578
I fucked your mama!

06:01.752 --> 06:02.840
Ooh!

06:03.014 --> 06:04.320
Bang! I fucked your mama!

06:04.494 --> 06:06.627
Oh ho ho...
He must've been furious.

06:07.845 --> 06:10.195
He should've shot you in the head.

06:11.675 --> 06:13.329
He tried.

06:13.503 --> 06:15.200
He stick the muzzle to my forehead.

06:15.940 --> 06:16.811
Click.

06:16.985 --> 06:18.726
Out of fucking bullets!

06:20.423 --> 06:21.642
So I just look at him and smile.

06:21.816 --> 06:25.689
I said, she was good!

06:25.863 --> 06:29.737
He was so angry, he pistol
whipped me to a bloody mess.

06:31.303 --> 06:35.090
Ah, Jacob, you are a storyteller.

06:35.264 --> 06:37.092
Come on, get me another drink.

06:37.266 --> 06:38.572
Andale pues.

06:44.839 --> 06:45.796
What do you mean?

06:48.538 --> 06:50.671
Just... como se es en Ingles?

06:50.845 --> 06:53.804
You...exaggerate.

07:10.865 --> 07:13.607
Oh... He's so dramatic.

07:15.217 --> 07:16.305
Come on!
Let's get in the water.

07:19.351 --> 07:20.178
Fucking slime.

07:20.352 --> 07:21.658
Let it go.

07:31.189 --> 07:32.887
Eli, how's your mother?

07:37.761 --> 07:39.023
Better, Yaniv, thank you.

07:41.025 --> 07:42.810
You must always take care of your mother.

07:42.984 --> 07:45.203
No one else will love you forever.

07:47.771 --> 07:49.251
I set up a meeting tonight at Remington...

07:49.425 --> 07:51.383
Cancel it, bring Hugo to me.

07:51.558 --> 07:52.950
No, Jacob, think about it, it's bad...

07:53.124 --> 07:55.083
I said cancel it!
Bring him to me.

08:17.627 --> 08:19.847
I have done business
with you for over five years.

08:20.021 --> 08:21.718
Together, we made a lot of money.

08:21.892 --> 08:23.851
This isn't gonna happen to
me. It's going to happen to you!

08:24.025 --> 08:25.635
It was a mistake to think
you could steal from me.

08:25.809 --> 08:27.202
Do you know who I am, mother fucker?

08:27.376 --> 08:28.725
And come into my house,

08:28.899 --> 08:29.813
embarrassing me in front of a woman.

08:29.987 --> 08:31.511
You understand me?!

08:31.685 --> 08:32.337
Don't do anything.

08:32.512 --> 08:34.296
I'm Hugo Vasquez!

08:34.470 --> 08:35.732
We're only after the nukes.

08:35.906 --> 08:36.733
You fucking know who I am, you...

08:36.907 --> 08:38.474
And talking to the feds?

08:38.648 --> 08:39.475
You putofaggot.
This isn't gonna happen to me!

08:39.649 --> 08:41.216
It's gonna cost you your life.

08:41.390 --> 08:42.609
I'm gonna burn your
mother's grave, you motherfucker

08:42.783 --> 08:43.435
you puto, you understand me?!

08:50.007 --> 08:51.705
Agh! Agh!

08:51.879 --> 08:56.144
Eli! Come see our friend on
fire! Let's put him out, Eli!

08:56.318 --> 08:59.451
Let's put him out! Eli!
Let's put him out, Eli!

08:59.626 --> 09:00.975
Our friend on fire!

09:01.149 --> 09:03.455
Agh! Agh! Aaagh!

09:16.556 --> 09:18.949
That's gonna cost us
over a hundred million dollars

09:19.123 --> 09:22.562
and probably a war.

09:22.736 --> 09:25.782
I have plenty of
money, and plenty of weapons.

09:38.186 --> 09:40.405
I'm listening.

09:40.580 --> 09:43.017
Hugo's dead.
There was nothing I could do.

09:45.585 --> 09:47.282
He won't be pleased.

09:48.283 --> 09:50.807
I'll make it up to him. Name your price.

09:52.156 --> 09:53.723
Hadar's head.

09:53.897 --> 09:55.595
That's not going to happen.

09:57.248 --> 09:58.249
We'll see.

10:15.789 --> 10:17.747
Hello, Kitten.

10:20.663 --> 10:24.145
So are you gonna search me too?

10:24.319 --> 10:26.016
Never know where I
might be hiding my weapons.

10:34.155 --> 10:36.592
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday, Mom.

10:36.766 --> 10:39.203
Turn that thing off. I look terrible.

10:39.377 --> 10:40.857
Stop it, Mom, you look great.

10:41.031 --> 10:42.250
- Oh...
- Happy birthday, Mom.

10:42.424 --> 10:44.774
Thank you.
Oh, thank you so much.

10:44.948 --> 10:46.341
You know I like chocolate.

10:46.515 --> 10:47.734
It is chocolate, for sure.

10:47.908 --> 10:48.778
- Good!
- On the inside.

10:48.952 --> 10:50.562
Ok. Oh...

10:50.737 --> 10:51.868
Come on, make your wish.

10:52.042 --> 10:53.522
Oh, there are too many. I got...

10:53.696 --> 10:55.306
That's what the problem is

10:55.480 --> 10:56.786
getting old, there are too many candles...

10:56.960 --> 10:58.048
I'll help you.

12:08.510 --> 12:09.685
Let's run.

12:27.485 --> 12:30.227
I want to set up a meeting with Alvarez.

12:30.401 --> 12:33.665
I think we should wait.
See if he suspects something.

12:33.840 --> 12:35.755
I'll tell him what happened.

12:35.929 --> 12:37.931
Jacob, you murdered his cousin.
Alvarez is not the kind of...

12:38.105 --> 12:39.671
He's a business man.

12:39.846 --> 12:43.110
I did him a favor not
to let him do it himself.

12:43.284 --> 12:45.242
You should've consulted
him first, let him decide.

12:45.416 --> 12:46.766
I decide.

12:49.116 --> 12:51.161
Jacob, I can't be
your advisor if you don't

12:51.335 --> 12:53.424
at least, listen to what I have to say.

12:53.598 --> 12:55.775
I pay you to advise.
You don't pay me to listen.

13:10.877 --> 13:11.965
Yeah.

13:12.356 --> 13:13.923
He's not answering my calls.

13:14.097 --> 13:15.969
I'm good, Gillian, how are you?

13:16.143 --> 13:19.363
Save the bullshit,
Yaniv. I need to talk to him.

13:19.537 --> 13:21.583
Well, first of all, you
know he doesn't use the phone.

13:21.757 --> 13:23.150
Yeah, I don't have time for this.

13:23.324 --> 13:24.586
And second,
I'll tell him you called

13:24.760 --> 13:26.893
only if you let him see the girls.

13:27.067 --> 13:27.937
Listen, you overpaid...

13:28.111 --> 13:29.286
Gillian.

13:29.460 --> 13:30.418
Shaggy-haired lapdog.

13:30.592 --> 13:32.246
Gillian!

13:32.420 --> 13:33.725
I'm not letting you come over here

13:33.900 --> 13:35.118
just to bring more chaos into his life.

13:35.292 --> 13:37.773
Oh yes, God forbid I come by

13:37.947 --> 13:40.123
and disrupt some major drug deal.

13:40.297 --> 13:42.082
You know that's not what I mean.

13:42.256 --> 13:44.084
He loves those girls.

13:44.258 --> 13:46.782
He wants to give them all
the things he never had.

13:46.956 --> 13:48.131
But you can't keep using them to...

13:48.305 --> 13:50.394
I can and I will.

13:50.568 --> 13:52.396
Now don't think for a minute
that you have more influence

13:52.570 --> 13:54.007
over him than I do.

13:54.181 --> 13:55.791
I don't and that's the problem.

13:55.965 --> 13:57.575
Oh, fuck off.

13:58.533 --> 14:01.841
Gillian, look,
I'll set up a lunch date,

14:02.015 --> 14:04.365
bring the girls, you'll get
anything from him you want.

14:06.454 --> 14:08.369
A week from Thursday.

14:08.543 --> 14:10.501
In Bel Air.

14:10.675 --> 14:12.634
Alright, I'll
see what I can do. But listen...

14:15.115 --> 14:16.464
Gillian?

14:40.792 --> 14:41.837
Ah...

14:43.056 --> 14:44.535
Thank you for seeing me...

14:44.709 --> 14:47.582
My friend.

14:47.756 --> 14:48.539
Let's go in.

15:17.307 --> 15:18.656
It is state of the art weaponry.

15:19.875 --> 15:22.051
You're aware of how
useful it's been in Iraq.

15:24.010 --> 15:26.838
I can take an armed vehicle in one shot.

15:30.930 --> 15:31.843
May I test it?

15:32.714 --> 15:33.802
Of course.

15:35.717 --> 15:38.459
If I like it,
I will buy two hundred...

15:38.894 --> 15:40.504
with ammunitions.

15:40.678 --> 15:41.897
Very good.

16:18.064 --> 16:21.067
I understand...

16:21.241 --> 16:24.157
that you may have
access to something nuclear.

16:25.288 --> 16:26.898
There's nothing
I can not deliver.

16:27.769 --> 16:31.251
Excellent! I will
talk with my associates and, um,

16:31.425 --> 16:33.079
I will discuss this with you further.

16:35.820 --> 16:37.518
Jacob, I thought...

16:39.563 --> 16:40.738
Thank you for coming.

16:41.261 --> 16:44.177
No. Thank you.

16:44.351 --> 16:45.787
I will be in touch.

16:51.967 --> 16:53.186
Leave us alone.

16:59.627 --> 17:01.237
- Do not ever question...
- I don't understand!

17:01.411 --> 17:02.891
- me in front of business
- I thought we weren't

17:03.065 --> 17:04.066
- associates!
- gonna have anything to do

17:04.240 --> 17:05.285
with nuclear weapons!

17:06.721 --> 17:08.244
You never listen!

17:11.204 --> 17:12.161
Eli!

17:13.728 --> 17:14.729
Eli!

17:18.254 --> 17:19.951
Yes, sir?

17:20.126 --> 17:22.345
Come help me, here. I'm outnumbered.

17:24.130 --> 17:26.349
Yeah, come help him.

17:26.523 --> 17:30.179
I'll, uh... uh,
thank you. Like, that's okay.

17:33.182 --> 17:36.707
Eli. Tell them
I can blow up the world.

17:36.881 --> 17:38.318
They don't believe me.

17:38.492 --> 17:40.189
Tell them, Eli!

17:51.592 --> 17:52.636
Get some sleep.

17:59.774 --> 18:01.341
- Eli?
- Yeah?

18:01.515 --> 18:03.212
Are you okay?
You seem different.

18:03.952 --> 18:05.519
Nuclear weapons?

18:05.693 --> 18:07.216
That is none of our business.

18:07.390 --> 18:10.959
But how? Where?
Where can he get access?

18:11.133 --> 18:13.048
It's not for us to know.

18:13.222 --> 18:16.747
Sorry. I understand.
Goodnight.

18:16.921 --> 18:18.619
Goodnight.

18:26.540 --> 18:31.240
Come on! Come on!
Come on! Go ahead.

18:31.762 --> 18:33.721
Eli?

18:36.463 --> 18:38.029
Last night.

18:38.204 --> 18:41.207
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said that.

18:41.381 --> 18:42.425
I shouldn't have questioned you.

18:42.599 --> 18:44.949
That's okay. You're my friend.

18:45.124 --> 18:48.214
In our business, it is
dangerous to have friends.

18:49.563 --> 18:51.869
What the fuck is wrong with you?

18:52.043 --> 18:55.960
You're hitting like a
little bitch! Come on!

18:56.135 --> 18:58.006
Come on!

19:02.315 --> 19:03.664
If you ever talk to me that way again,

19:03.838 --> 19:05.796
I'll fuck your eyes out.

19:08.625 --> 19:10.366
Would you want us to get rid of him?

19:11.193 --> 19:13.804
Why? He's the best.

19:34.477 --> 19:38.307
Jacob, what are you
doing with all your shoes?

19:38.481 --> 19:40.527
Giving them away. Theres
a lot of people who need shoes.

19:50.058 --> 19:51.668
Have you seen Yaniv today?

19:51.842 --> 19:53.540
No, sir, I haven't.

19:57.631 --> 20:02.070
Today must be perfect,
Eli. Everything must be perfect.

20:05.247 --> 20:09.033
Eli, they should be here
soon. Have you heard from Yaniv?

20:09.817 --> 20:12.689
What the fuck are you doing?

20:12.863 --> 20:14.387
What the fuck are you doing?

20:14.561 --> 20:18.391
Never! Never have red roses in my house!

20:20.871 --> 20:22.569
Jacob, we're here.

20:24.832 --> 20:28.052
My babies. How's my babies?

20:28.227 --> 20:30.881
Daddy! Daddy!

20:34.494 --> 20:37.192
How's mama?
Take care of you good?

20:40.543 --> 20:41.892
Let's go.

20:45.461 --> 20:46.810
How you doing?

20:53.861 --> 20:55.558
For some reason, he misses you.

20:57.212 --> 20:59.258
They love him so much.

21:08.397 --> 21:09.746
Girls, why don't you go wait in the car

21:09.920 --> 21:11.618
while I talk to daddy, okay?

21:19.452 --> 21:20.540
I need more money.

21:20.714 --> 21:23.194
You have plenty of money.

21:23.369 --> 21:25.153
Don't screw with me, Jacob.

21:25.327 --> 21:28.069
I want another twenty thousand. A month.

21:31.290 --> 21:32.203
Speak with Yaniv.

21:32.378 --> 21:34.162
No, fuck Yaniv.

21:34.336 --> 21:35.598
Are you gonna get me the money?

21:42.301 --> 21:44.346
Relax. I'll give you the money.

21:51.571 --> 21:52.876
Lapdog.

21:53.050 --> 21:54.008
Bitch.

23:03.294 --> 23:04.644
What's going on?

23:04.992 --> 23:08.430
The drop-off was
running late. They just arrived.

23:08.604 --> 23:10.345
Why are you late?

23:12.129 --> 23:14.915
Why are you late?

23:15.089 --> 23:18.658
One of the accounts was
short. He did not want to pay.

23:18.832 --> 23:20.094
Who?

23:20.268 --> 23:21.922
I've got it taken care of.

23:23.314 --> 23:27.275
Don't let me repeat myself.

23:27.623 --> 23:29.843
The yogurt stop in
Hollywood.

23:30.017 --> 23:31.584
They were four thousand short.

23:32.672 --> 23:34.369
Did you collect the money?

23:35.675 --> 23:37.024
No.

23:39.505 --> 23:43.422
You got one hour.
One hour to get the money here.

23:49.036 --> 23:53.867
I snapped his arm,
Jacob! He did not have it.

23:54.041 --> 23:55.564
Jacob, wait.

23:59.002 --> 24:03.659
Jacob! Wait! Wait.

24:10.100 --> 24:12.233
What the fuck?

24:26.726 --> 24:28.205
I'll make sure all
the money's accounted for.

24:28.379 --> 24:30.077
Have you spoke with Alvarez?

24:30.251 --> 24:31.687
He wants a meeting.

24:31.861 --> 24:34.342
Tell him I will meet
him only in the state.

24:34.908 --> 24:38.389
I know that. He's
agreed to that. He's very angry.

24:38.564 --> 24:40.566
Bullshit.

24:40.740 --> 24:42.481
He feels you should've
consulted him first.

24:42.655 --> 24:44.395
Ha. Consult.

24:47.355 --> 24:49.052
He wants compensation.

24:53.448 --> 24:54.971
And what did you say?

24:55.232 --> 24:58.409
I am sorry, Senor Alvarez, but
he doesn't listen to me?

24:58.584 --> 25:01.282
He does whatever the fuck he wants!

25:04.111 --> 25:06.940
I will set time and
location and tell Alvarez

25:07.114 --> 25:08.811
I want the compensation for all the money

25:08.985 --> 25:10.073
his cousin stole from me.

25:10.247 --> 25:11.597
We don't know if that's true.

25:11.771 --> 25:13.512
I know that's true!

25:16.079 --> 25:20.736
You think I am a crazy man who
kills people for no reason?

25:21.432 --> 25:22.956
No.

25:25.393 --> 25:26.916
I'll let you know when I decide

25:27.090 --> 25:29.266
when I want to see Alvarez. Go.

25:32.966 --> 25:34.141
Ido, stay here.

25:39.320 --> 25:41.365
Watch yourself.
He's getting paranoid.

25:51.158 --> 25:52.638
All I'm thinking about is how I want to

25:52.812 --> 25:55.249
bang this broad, right?
But we're having this great

25:55.423 --> 25:58.731
conversation, right?
She smiles, she winks.

25:58.905 --> 26:01.081
So I figure this is
gonna be my lucky night.

26:01.255 --> 26:04.563
The cab driver, he pulls up in
front of her hotel, right?

26:04.737 --> 26:07.087
So, I start to get out of the
car and she stops me

26:07.261 --> 26:09.698
and she says, Tony...

26:09.872 --> 26:12.701
I've been with old guys before
and I been with broke guys

26:12.875 --> 26:15.574
before, but they just
can't be the same guy.

26:17.358 --> 26:20.013
If they just can't be the
same... You believe this shit?

26:20.187 --> 26:22.624
It... It...
It can't be the same guy?

26:22.798 --> 26:24.757
So, off she goes...

26:24.931 --> 26:28.238
and I get to take me and my blue
balls home to spank the monkey.

26:28.412 --> 26:29.588
Yeah.

26:31.981 --> 26:34.462
Jacob! How you doing?

26:34.636 --> 26:36.246
Very good.

26:36.420 --> 26:37.291
Really good to see you.

26:37.465 --> 26:39.206
Thank you for coming.

26:39.380 --> 26:42.470
Listen, about our
little misunderstanding, yeah?

26:44.559 --> 26:48.084
Oh, this is gorgeous. Oh my god!

26:48.258 --> 26:50.826
- You like it?
- Yes. Oh...

26:51.000 --> 26:52.045
Wait 'til you see the back yard.

26:52.219 --> 26:53.437
Oh!

26:55.135 --> 26:56.615
Are you gonna steal from me again?

26:56.789 --> 26:58.181
Jacob, I didn't steal from you...

26:58.355 --> 27:00.009
Are you gonna steal from me again?!

27:00.183 --> 27:01.271
Jacob! I didn't steal from you!

27:02.882 --> 27:05.928
Well, when you both have some

27:06.102 --> 27:08.757
grand kids coming to me, they're

27:08.931 --> 27:13.283
sure gonna have fun in this
pool. Oh, I can't believe this!

27:13.457 --> 27:14.328
They sure will, mom.

27:14.502 --> 27:15.982
Agh!

27:17.636 --> 27:19.942
Eli...
Want to give us a hand?

27:22.641 --> 27:23.990
Ugh!

27:27.254 --> 27:28.951
Bring the car around back.

27:38.091 --> 27:39.483
Hello?

27:39.658 --> 27:41.311
It's Yaniv.
We're on for tonight.

27:41.485 --> 27:43.966
I don't like this,
Yaniv. I don't like any of it.

27:44.140 --> 27:45.185
Look, you have two options.

27:45.359 --> 27:46.665
You make a deal with Jacob

27:46.839 --> 27:49.102
or you take your ass back to China.

27:49.276 --> 27:52.279
You know this is bullshit.
I've dealt with his kind before.

27:52.453 --> 27:54.890
Nothing but leeches.
They suck the life right out.

27:55.064 --> 27:59.634
I don't want to hear it. Are we on or not?

27:59.808 --> 28:01.767
Yeah.

28:05.509 --> 28:06.510
Same old, you know, they're

28:06.685 --> 28:07.947
getting squeezed by vice for

28:08.121 --> 28:11.515
capacity issues, underage, drugs.

28:11.690 --> 28:13.343
What was the numbers again?

28:13.517 --> 28:15.650
They claim it to be
on a forty percent margin.

28:15.824 --> 28:17.957
I think it's over sixty.

28:18.131 --> 28:19.915
Will this be easy?

28:20.089 --> 28:22.048
Should be.

30:10.025 --> 30:12.723
Okay, fun time is over. Where's Hadar?

30:43.754 --> 30:46.453
Mr. Hadar,
I apologize for the wait.

30:52.285 --> 30:55.114
Why are you late? Apologize to Mr. Hadar.

30:55.288 --> 30:58.160
I'm trying to run a goddamn nightclub.

31:06.342 --> 31:08.997
I apologize.
I didn't mean any disrespect.

31:12.479 --> 31:13.654
We're all busy men.

31:13.828 --> 31:15.569
Let's get to the point.

31:15.874 --> 31:18.050
You're having trouble
with certain legal elements.

31:18.224 --> 31:20.182
I can make that go away.

31:22.358 --> 31:24.883
If you could get LAPD off our back,

31:25.057 --> 31:26.710
we're willing to pay for that.

31:26.885 --> 31:29.670
Why can't we pay the cops ourselves?

31:29.844 --> 31:31.977
Why do we need you as our middle man?

31:32.151 --> 31:34.153
Chen.

31:35.023 --> 31:37.286
If you go to
the police and offer them money,

31:37.460 --> 31:41.551
they will throw you in jail.
Our relationship more complex.

31:41.900 --> 31:43.597
So, how much are we talking about?

31:43.771 --> 31:44.859
As I explained to Mr. Wong,

31:45.033 --> 31:47.253
We're not here asking for money.

31:47.427 --> 31:49.820
We're expecting to develop a relationship.

31:49.995 --> 31:51.257
Mr. Hadar owns many establishments...

31:51.431 --> 31:53.128
You want a piece of our club.

31:54.608 --> 31:56.044
A partnership with Mr. Hadar

31:56.218 --> 31:58.264
would be in best interest
to all concerned.

32:00.266 --> 32:02.921
Why the hell did you not tell me?

32:03.095 --> 32:04.792
I did tell you.

32:04.966 --> 32:07.055
You're just hearing what you want to hear.

32:09.014 --> 32:10.537
Let me make this clear.

32:10.711 --> 32:12.191
If you don't agree to my terms,

32:12.365 --> 32:14.715
the doors in this place
will be shut in a week.

32:14.889 --> 32:17.544
Chen, if we get fined again,

32:17.718 --> 32:19.589
They'll take our liquor license.

32:21.330 --> 32:23.463
Yaniv and I, we discussed a...

32:23.637 --> 32:25.682
30 percent interest in the club.

32:25.856 --> 32:28.511
God damn it.

32:28.685 --> 32:29.730
Fifty percent.

32:29.904 --> 32:31.079
You son of a bitch.

32:31.253 --> 32:32.385
Okay? What... What the fuck?

32:32.559 --> 32:33.516
Sit down. Sit down.

32:33.690 --> 32:35.344
What are you gonna do?

32:35.518 --> 32:37.085
- Mr. Hadar, please.
- What're you gonna do?

32:37.259 --> 32:38.086
- Please reconsider.
- Shoot me in my own

32:38.260 --> 32:38.695
fucking club?!

32:40.132 --> 32:41.437
We... We've poured our souls in this club.

32:41.611 --> 32:43.744
Please reconsider.
Mr. Hadar, please.

32:43.918 --> 32:45.267
You bastard! Crook!

32:45.441 --> 32:46.790
Sit down.

32:46.965 --> 32:47.791
You wanna kill me?

32:47.966 --> 32:49.358
Forty percent.

32:49.532 --> 32:51.012
Forty percent,
we'll agree to that right now.

32:51.186 --> 32:52.448
Go ahead. Do it.

32:52.622 --> 32:53.362
Go ahead and fucking shoot me!

32:53.536 --> 32:54.842
Chen!

32:56.670 --> 33:00.239
Paperwork will be drawn
up for fifty percent partnership

33:00.413 --> 33:04.678
It'll be greater if there's any delays.

33:04.852 --> 33:06.201
Never damn God.

33:06.375 --> 33:08.073
How do you expect to receive a blessing?

33:26.178 --> 33:28.789
Why would you negotiate
a deal for thirty percent?

33:28.963 --> 33:30.269
I never told him that.

33:30.443 --> 33:32.227
He came up with this himself?

33:32.401 --> 33:33.707
I told him a partnership with us would

33:33.881 --> 33:35.883
eliminate their problems.

33:36.536 --> 33:38.973
Your lack of clarity made me appear weak.

33:39.147 --> 33:41.497
Don't let this happen again.

33:41.671 --> 33:43.804
I'm sorry, Jacob.

33:43.978 --> 33:45.675
Driver, take us to Bel Air.

34:20.319 --> 34:22.321
Join me and Yaniv for dessert.

34:22.495 --> 34:24.018
Yes, Jacob.

34:26.890 --> 34:27.891
You sure you don't want a dog?

34:28.066 --> 34:28.892
No, thanks.

34:33.680 --> 34:36.726
Eli, lighten up.
We're not around Jacob now.

34:36.900 --> 34:38.815
Darth Vader isn't here
to fuck up your day.

34:40.078 --> 34:41.949
Do you think Jacob is evil?

34:42.123 --> 34:44.821
No. No, I don't and I
shouldn't have said that.

34:48.303 --> 34:50.653
Feds would have a field
day, seeing you and I talking

34:50.827 --> 34:52.916
together, they'd think we're
masterminding some kind of coup.

34:57.747 --> 35:00.968
If you don't mind me
asking, why are we here?

35:01.142 --> 35:03.840
I just wanted to talk
alone, away from all the drama.

35:06.539 --> 35:08.584
You know Jacob and I
have been having some problems.

35:11.152 --> 35:12.719
Yeah, there's been some tension.

35:12.893 --> 35:15.809
Tension? We're about to
tear each other's throats out.

35:18.377 --> 35:20.770
It's just growing pains, really.

35:20.944 --> 35:24.339
We don't see eye to eye on
the future and that's okay.

35:24.513 --> 35:27.429
It's all, ultimately, for the best.

35:27.603 --> 35:29.170
I'm not sure what
you're trying to tell me, Yaniv.

35:33.653 --> 35:36.395
Jacob and I are going our separate ways.

35:36.569 --> 35:40.007
That's what the
get-together tonight is for.

35:40.181 --> 35:43.880
He's giving me full control
of west coast operations.

35:44.054 --> 35:47.841
Total autonomy.
I get to call all the shots.

35:48.015 --> 35:50.670
I get to deal with the Alvarez fallout.

35:53.194 --> 35:54.413
Yaniv, I'm still not understanding why...

35:54.587 --> 35:56.284
I'm here, offering you a job.

35:58.417 --> 36:03.030
More money, less headaches.
I been watching you, Eli.

36:03.204 --> 36:07.295
You're calm, cool, not a
liability waiting to happen.

36:07.469 --> 36:09.863
Thank you.

36:10.037 --> 36:11.343
In this business,

36:11.517 --> 36:13.954
sometimes people need to disappear.

36:14.128 --> 36:16.086
It is what it is.

36:16.261 --> 36:19.481
You just have to make
sure it's the right people.

36:19.655 --> 36:21.048
You have to make sure business

36:21.222 --> 36:23.442
always comes before emotions.

36:26.706 --> 36:29.535
I agree, but do you
think Jacob will go for it?

36:29.709 --> 36:31.232
Me leaving him?

36:31.406 --> 36:34.670
I think so.
I'm still like a brother to him.

36:34.844 --> 36:37.107
He's gonna want me
shadowed by someone he trusts.

36:41.416 --> 36:44.114
That's the best fucking dog ever.

36:44.289 --> 36:45.246
You sure you don't want one?

36:45.420 --> 36:46.465
Thanks, I'm good.

36:54.299 --> 36:56.344
Eli, come have a seat with us, Eli.

37:02.785 --> 37:04.526
We were discussing just the weather.

37:04.700 --> 37:06.311
The weather?

37:06.485 --> 37:10.837
Yeah. 'Cause our entire
day influenced by the weather.

37:11.011 --> 37:13.100
What to do, how to do it.

37:13.274 --> 37:14.884
That's true.

37:15.058 --> 37:17.887
If we were in New York
now, we wouldn't have a

37:18.061 --> 37:20.977
lovely treat outside, under the stars.

37:21.151 --> 37:22.065
Four degrees Celsius today.

37:22.240 --> 37:23.893
Six inches of rain.

37:24.067 --> 37:27.201
Exactly. Makes me
uncomfortable thinking about it.

37:27.375 --> 37:29.464
Eli grew up in New York, yeah?

37:29.638 --> 37:31.510
Yeah, until I was in high school.

37:31.684 --> 37:33.120
It was too cold over there?

37:33.294 --> 37:35.427
No. Too hot.

37:35.601 --> 37:38.125
I remember dripping with sweat,
just walking between classes.

37:38.299 --> 37:40.214
They used to call me the waterfall.

37:41.128 --> 37:45.263
When I first came to
US, it was the dead of winter.

37:45.437 --> 37:47.265
I used to wear short pants in snow

37:47.439 --> 37:49.092
and people would stare and laugh at me.

37:49.267 --> 37:50.616
Because you were crazy.

37:50.790 --> 37:53.401
It wasn't that cold.
I know cold.

37:53.575 --> 37:57.536
In Istanbul, when you
cry, your eyes freeze shut.

38:00.016 --> 38:01.757
Only the weather.

38:01.931 --> 38:02.932
I don't get it.

38:04.325 --> 38:05.848
Yaniv, how long have we been together?

38:06.022 --> 38:07.807
Almost fifteen years.

38:07.981 --> 38:11.811
When I first arrive in
US, you took care of me.

38:11.985 --> 38:13.421
Ever since we met, we been

38:13.595 --> 38:14.814
best friends.

38:14.988 --> 38:16.337
Best friends.

38:16.511 --> 38:17.991
And why did we move to California?

38:18.165 --> 38:19.688
Better business opportunities.

38:19.862 --> 38:21.647
No, you don't remember?

38:21.821 --> 38:23.562
I thought it was for
better business opportunities.

38:23.736 --> 38:24.563
It was the weather!

38:26.608 --> 38:29.307
That's right, we were
tired of freezing our ass off.

38:29.481 --> 38:33.093
It was consistency!
It was consistency!

38:39.099 --> 38:42.450
You betrayed me.

38:42.624 --> 38:46.802
Ido is my new advisor.
And you're my lieutenant.

38:46.976 --> 38:48.935
Take care of this.

38:54.419 --> 38:55.376
Hugo.

39:07.562 --> 39:10.478
I can't believe it.
Yaniv and Hugo.

39:11.479 --> 39:14.830
They had a side deal moving ecstasy.

39:15.004 --> 39:16.179
Jacob knew but he didn't mind.

39:16.354 --> 39:19.357
Then why did he kill him?

39:19.531 --> 39:21.924
Hugo began selling
information to the Feds.

39:22.098 --> 39:24.840
You think Yaniv was
talking to the Feds, as well?

39:25.014 --> 39:27.800
He had been acting
strange lately, making mistakes.

39:27.974 --> 39:29.715
Mistakes are always a sign.

39:47.341 --> 39:48.647
Ah, God.

40:12.888 --> 40:15.238
Why do you think
Yaniv would betray Jacob?

40:15.413 --> 40:17.110
We'll not talk about this again.

40:33.648 --> 40:34.606
It's done.

40:41.439 --> 40:45.443
Loyalty is a difficult creature.

40:45.617 --> 40:50.186
Cannot be bought 'cause
everyone has a price.

40:50.360 --> 40:55.061
Can't be threatened.
Some do not value life.

40:57.324 --> 41:01.589
Loyalty comes only from love.

41:01.763 --> 41:05.854
Unfortunately, not everyone has a heart.

41:17.953 --> 41:20.216
I thought that's
what it is. All about action?

41:20.390 --> 41:22.784
Everyone's gone.

41:22.958 --> 41:25.091
Babe, no more video, please.

41:25.265 --> 41:26.745
This may be the last time I see you guys

41:26.919 --> 41:28.790
In I don't know how long...

41:28.964 --> 41:30.400
Ah, shouldn't be more than a year or two.

41:30.575 --> 41:31.750
You serious?

41:33.186 --> 41:34.448
It's nothing close to that. I promise you.

41:34.622 --> 41:36.145
Oh, I don't know.

41:36.319 --> 41:37.190
I know a case where an
agent was under for six years.

41:37.364 --> 41:38.583
Seriously?

41:38.757 --> 41:39.627
Yeah, seriously

41:39.801 --> 41:40.933
and it was a mob case, too.

41:41.107 --> 41:42.021
Serious or not

41:42.195 --> 41:43.022
we don't want to hear about it.

41:43.196 --> 41:44.719
Thank you.

41:44.893 --> 41:45.764
I'm just trying to make a point.

41:45.938 --> 41:46.982
You never know about these

41:47.156 --> 41:48.549
Thank you, I know.

41:48.723 --> 41:50.116
See how lucky you are, Ron?

41:50.290 --> 41:51.900
You just have to live
with Hadar - I gotta.

41:52.074 --> 41:53.206
spend every waking moment
with Mary Sunshine over here.

41:53.380 --> 41:56.470
You're worse than Hadar.

41:56.644 --> 41:58.254
She loves me. She really does.

41:58.428 --> 41:59.473
- t's all a cover
- Yeah, yeah.

41:59.647 --> 42:01.257
Oh yeah.

42:01.431 --> 42:02.824
Hey, I want both off
you to look at the camera

42:02.998 --> 42:04.347
and promise me that
you'll take care of him.

42:04.522 --> 42:05.827
No, he can take care of himself.

42:06.001 --> 42:08.177
Guys, I'm serious.

42:08.351 --> 42:09.178
Oh...

42:09.352 --> 42:10.658
Okay.

42:10.832 --> 42:11.659
Well take care of

42:13.269 --> 42:14.749
- little Ronnie!
- Promise to take

42:14.923 --> 42:15.968
care of little Ronnie. Yes, we will.

42:16.142 --> 42:17.578
See what you've done?

42:17.752 --> 42:19.188
No, you guys take care of big Ronnie.

42:19.362 --> 42:20.799
I intend to take care of
little Ronnie, myself,

42:20.973 --> 42:22.017
as soon as I can get you two out of here.

42:22.191 --> 42:23.236
Oh, okay.

42:23.410 --> 42:24.890
You heard the lady.

42:25.064 --> 42:26.065
- Yes, we did.
- Party's over.

42:26.239 --> 42:27.501
Okay. Well,

42:27.675 --> 42:29.024
You know, I should go home anyway...

42:29.198 --> 42:31.723
see what kinda damage
the kids did. The boys.

42:31.897 --> 42:33.594
Alright, I'll walk you out.

42:37.598 --> 42:39.078
Love you guys.

42:39.252 --> 42:40.514
- I love you.
- Be careful.

42:40.688 --> 42:41.950
Careful's not in the handbook.

42:42.124 --> 42:43.082
Say hello to Jeffrey for me.

42:43.256 --> 42:44.431
I will.

42:44.605 --> 42:45.998
Ready. Thanks for coming.

42:46.172 --> 42:50.959
Oooh...

42:51.133 --> 42:53.701
Hey, everything's gonna be okay.

42:53.875 --> 42:55.747
He's the best agent I've ever known.

42:55.921 --> 43:00.665
Everyone talks about saving the
world. He can actually do it.

43:01.361 --> 43:02.667
Okay.

43:02.841 --> 43:04.103
Thank you.

43:24.950 --> 43:26.038
Who are you?

43:26.212 --> 43:28.127
I represent Mr. Jacob Hadar.

43:37.136 --> 43:38.790
Where's Yaniv?

43:38.964 --> 43:41.749
I will be speaking for Mr. Hadar now.

43:41.923 --> 43:45.840
Listen, holmes, you
may drop the right names,

43:46.014 --> 43:48.408
but I only speak to the man I know.

43:48.582 --> 43:50.323
I'd be very careful.

43:50.497 --> 43:52.847
Disrespecting me is same
as disrespecting Mr. Hadar.

43:53.021 --> 43:53.848
Fuck you, esai.

43:57.460 --> 44:00.289
You and that pinche puto, Hadar.

44:00.463 --> 44:04.076
The only reason I'm here
is to talk settlement.

44:04.250 --> 44:07.035
What do you have to offer?

44:07.209 --> 44:09.995
We offer the opportunity to
continue to run your business

44:10.169 --> 44:11.431
in our territory.

44:14.390 --> 44:16.392
Your territory?

44:16.566 --> 44:18.786
Man, you're a joke.

44:22.268 --> 44:24.400
Listen...You have Yaniv

44:24.574 --> 44:28.143
come talk to me or this
is all gonna end very badly.

44:30.450 --> 44:32.931
I wish you would reconsider your position.

44:33.105 --> 44:36.151
Holmes, get the fuck out of here.

44:37.979 --> 44:39.938
Let's go.

44:47.162 --> 44:48.990
We need to kill them all.

44:49.164 --> 44:52.428
Ido, you're an advisor now.

44:52.602 --> 44:55.127
You can't let emotion
get in the way of business.

44:56.868 --> 44:58.913
You're right.

45:05.703 --> 45:07.400
There's lots of activity today.

45:07.574 --> 45:10.925
An increase in security,
in case Alvarez tries anything.

45:11.099 --> 45:12.274
I'll see if I can find out more.

45:12.448 --> 45:16.104
Talking to yourself?

45:16.278 --> 45:17.976
I was trying to remember a poem.

45:18.150 --> 45:20.935
A Man In His Life, by Amichai.

45:21.109 --> 45:23.198
That's one of Jacob's favorites.

45:23.372 --> 45:25.766
I was going to recite it
for him at his birthday party.

45:25.940 --> 45:27.028
He'd like that.

45:27.202 --> 45:28.160
Eli!

45:28.334 --> 45:31.293
Excuse me.

45:31.467 --> 45:33.948
Be sure to recite the poem in Hebrew.

45:34.688 --> 45:37.386
It'll be disrespectful
to say it in English.

45:47.832 --> 45:48.876
Ron, what's happening?

45:49.050 --> 45:49.747
Did you see anything?

45:49.921 --> 45:51.009
No.

45:51.183 --> 45:52.358
Fuck.

45:55.404 --> 45:56.884
Did you look everywhere?

45:57.058 --> 45:58.016
I did.

45:58.190 --> 45:59.669
Alvarez?

45:59.844 --> 46:00.845
We don't know.

46:01.019 --> 46:02.324
How many of them?

46:03.978 --> 46:06.764
We're not sure yet. A motion
detector was activated.

46:06.938 --> 46:07.939
Jacob, what are you doing?

46:08.113 --> 46:09.810
Protecting myself.

46:09.984 --> 46:11.116
Get out of the fucking way!

46:11.290 --> 46:12.639
Jacob, please!

46:12.813 --> 46:14.032
Jacob, you can't go out there.

46:14.206 --> 46:14.989
Section one is clear.

46:15.163 --> 46:16.556
Section one is clear.

46:16.730 --> 46:18.210
Jacob!

46:18.384 --> 46:20.690
This is Eli.
I need a status report now.

46:20.865 --> 46:21.735
Sections one, two, and three

46:21.909 --> 46:22.780
have all been cleared.

46:22.954 --> 46:24.216
Copy that.

46:24.390 --> 46:26.392
This is Ido!
Take them alive!

46:26.566 --> 46:27.567
Were all converging on sector four!

46:27.741 --> 46:28.916
How many?

46:29.090 --> 46:32.311
Just one, a kid!

46:32.485 --> 46:36.010
He's down. He's down.

46:36.184 --> 46:37.620
Keep looking, sweep the house.

46:37.795 --> 46:39.492
Make sure there's no others.

46:43.191 --> 46:46.194
Jacob.

46:46.368 --> 46:47.326
Why are you here?

46:47.500 --> 46:50.068
Fuck you.

46:50.242 --> 46:52.287
Do you know who I am?

46:52.461 --> 46:54.028
Yeah, you that mobster dude.

46:54.202 --> 46:55.203
What you think I do to someone

46:55.377 --> 46:57.379
break into my house?

46:57.553 --> 46:59.207
Dont matter, homie. Had to do it.

46:59.381 --> 47:01.166
Had to do it?

47:02.384 --> 47:04.082
West Side Pimps, homie.

47:09.783 --> 47:11.524
What you say now, homie?

47:11.698 --> 47:13.613
Careful, Jacob, he's gonna piss his pants.

47:13.787 --> 47:15.876
Fuck you, homie!

47:16.050 --> 47:17.660
What you say now?

47:17.835 --> 47:20.359
West Side Pimps.

47:20.533 --> 47:22.056
He's not afraid of you, Jacob.

47:22.230 --> 47:23.536
You just gonna take that?

47:27.757 --> 47:28.846
No.

47:32.066 --> 47:33.198
If he was one of the Alvarez guys

47:33.372 --> 47:35.113
I could be dead now!

47:35.287 --> 47:36.418
Take him to doctor.

47:36.592 --> 47:37.637
What about the kid?

47:37.811 --> 47:39.334
Has a heart.

47:39.508 --> 47:42.250
He can either work for
me or put a bullet in his head.

47:42.424 --> 47:43.773
It ain't nothing, man!

47:43.948 --> 47:45.819
I'll work for him!
I'll work for him.

47:50.998 --> 47:52.173
Ron, you're losing batteries.

47:52.347 --> 47:54.045
We're breaking up. Ron...

48:07.362 --> 48:09.147
When people do
these kind of things in movies,

48:09.321 --> 48:11.976
it always seems so stupid. But anyways...

48:12.150 --> 48:14.413
Hi, I'm sure you've already heard the news

48:14.587 --> 48:17.155
through proper channels that
we're having a baby. And I

48:17.329 --> 48:19.984
wanted to make you this video.
They still call this video,

48:20.158 --> 48:22.812
don't they? Well, I wanted to
make you this so that you can

48:22.987 --> 48:25.990
share the whole experience with
me, 'cause even if you can't be

48:26.164 --> 48:30.342
here, I'm so excited.
I sure hope you are, too.

48:30.516 --> 48:33.345
You're gonna be such a wonderful
father. I can see it now.

48:33.519 --> 48:37.479
You going to all the little
league games, or dance recitals,

48:37.653 --> 48:40.961
or whatever it may be.
It's gonna be so much fun.

48:41.135 --> 48:44.269
Ah... so be careful.

48:44.443 --> 48:47.011
I know I'm not meant
to say that but be careful

48:47.185 --> 48:51.232
and I promise I'll
do everything the doctor says.

48:51.406 --> 48:55.193
Well, that's all I've got.
I love you. Bye.

49:03.810 --> 49:06.682
Put that over there.

49:06.856 --> 49:07.901
Where's Jacob?

49:08.075 --> 49:09.555
Still in his study.

49:09.729 --> 49:11.687
Then why are you here? Never leave him.

49:11.861 --> 49:14.125
I didn't want to talk
over the radio. I'm concerned.

49:14.299 --> 49:15.735
He doesn't pay you to be concerned.

49:15.909 --> 49:18.042
Get back to the door
and don't leave him again.

49:24.613 --> 49:26.093
Jacob?

49:29.227 --> 49:30.750
Jacob?

49:38.801 --> 49:40.281
Jacob?

49:53.381 --> 49:54.774
Uh... Ah!

49:54.948 --> 49:56.254
Eli, come join me.

49:56.428 --> 49:57.385
No, sir.
I heard sounds and I thought...

49:57.559 --> 49:59.083
Well, get the fuck out!

50:16.230 --> 50:18.015
Happy birthday!

50:18.189 --> 50:20.800
Thank you for coming, thank you.

50:20.974 --> 50:22.019
Happy birthday.

50:22.193 --> 50:23.063
Thank you for coming.

50:23.237 --> 50:24.369
Thank you, thank you. Thank you.

50:24.543 --> 50:25.370
Happy birthday, Jacob.

50:25.544 --> 50:26.806
Thank you.

50:26.980 --> 50:28.329
Happy birthday, handsome.

50:28.503 --> 50:31.202
Thank you.
Thank you for coming.

50:44.519 --> 50:47.218
Happy birthday!

50:47.392 --> 50:52.049
Eli! Look at me, Eli!
Look, it's me, Eli! Hahaha!

50:53.354 --> 50:54.529
Happy birthday.

50:54.703 --> 50:55.704
Thank you for coming. Thank you.

50:55.878 --> 50:57.271
Happy birthday.

50:57.532 --> 50:58.881
- Thank you.
- Wonderful party.

50:59.056 --> 51:00.405
I'm a...
I'm glad you approve it.

51:00.579 --> 51:01.710
Oh, but there are some things

51:01.884 --> 51:03.321
I don't approve of, huh?

51:03.495 --> 51:04.931
We'll talk later.

51:05.105 --> 51:06.933
I'm glad your granddaughter could make it.

51:07.107 --> 51:08.630
I see that age doesnt necessarily

51:08.804 --> 51:10.937
bring wisdom.

51:11.111 --> 51:13.287
Vodka!
Give me the bottle, please.

51:14.462 --> 51:17.335
Jacob. People have been looking for you.

51:18.031 --> 51:19.250
Mr. Ivanov is here.

51:19.424 --> 51:20.686
Fuck him.

51:22.340 --> 51:23.471
Please, Jacob, he could be
very helpful to us with Alvarez.

51:23.645 --> 51:24.951
I'm tired of being monkey.

51:37.877 --> 51:39.183
Viktor.

51:39.357 --> 51:40.619
Jacob. Happy birthday!

51:40.793 --> 51:42.142
Thank you for coming.

51:42.316 --> 51:44.188
Thank you for coming. Thank you
for coming.

51:51.238 --> 51:52.892
You remember Sergei?

51:53.066 --> 51:54.328
Of course.

51:54.502 --> 51:55.416
It's good to see you.

52:02.510 --> 52:05.165
Let's go join the party, guys. Let's go.

52:33.150 --> 52:35.500
Amen. Amen.

52:38.764 --> 52:40.940
Enjoy the party, guys.

52:41.114 --> 52:42.811
Thank you, Jacob.

52:44.639 --> 52:46.598
So let's eat.

53:01.482 --> 53:02.918
I didnt know he played the piano.

53:03.092 --> 53:04.920
Only for about a year,

53:05.094 --> 53:07.793
but I heard he studied

Actually, it's probably a loan out.

53:39.912 --> 53:42.306

Thank you.

55:02.777 --> 55:05.214
Go sit down, Eli,
I'm talking to the young lady.

55:05.389 --> 55:06.999
Go.

55:10.611 --> 55:12.918
What're you doing with that old pervert?

55:13.092 --> 55:16.313
I can give you everything.

55:16.487 --> 55:18.445
Please, let go.

55:20.795 --> 55:24.059
Please. Mr. Hadar.

55:26.497 --> 55:27.846
You don't want me for an enemy, Hadar.

55:28.020 --> 55:29.326
Go fuck yourself.

55:29.500 --> 55:30.501
What happened?
What's going on?

55:30.675 --> 55:32.111
We're having a party.

55:32.285 --> 55:35.549
Jacob... You're
embarrassing yourself. Relax.

55:35.723 --> 55:36.985
Embarrassing myself?

55:37.159 --> 55:40.032
Touch me again,
I'll fucking kill you!

55:40.206 --> 55:42.556
Everyone came to watch the monkey.

55:42.730 --> 55:44.166
Let's go inside.

55:44.341 --> 55:46.430
Watch the monkey play! Sing!

55:51.043 --> 55:54.655
Watch the monkey!

55:54.829 --> 55:57.005
Jacob. Jacob!

55:57.179 --> 55:58.703
Watch the monkey!

55:58.877 --> 56:00.705
Everyone came to watch the monkey!

56:00.879 --> 56:02.663
Everyone comes to watch the monkey!

56:02.837 --> 56:03.838
Everyone came to watch the monkey!

56:04.012 --> 56:04.839
Take him inside!

56:05.013 --> 56:06.624
Everybody!

56:06.798 --> 56:08.190
Take...take your

56:08.365 --> 56:09.888
- Take him!
- fucking hands off me!

56:10.062 --> 56:11.933
I'll kill you fucking
all! I'll kill you all!

56:12.107 --> 56:14.109
- Relax. Please continue.
- Take your fucking

56:14.283 --> 56:15.633
hands off me!

56:15.807 --> 56:17.548
- I apologize. Please...
- Get your

56:17.722 --> 56:19.027
- please continue to enjoy
- fucking hands off me!

56:19.201 --> 56:20.246
yourselves.

56:34.826 --> 56:35.740
Jacob?

56:35.914 --> 56:37.524
We need to talk.

56:38.873 --> 56:40.484
Come in.

56:46.098 --> 56:48.796
Everyone is gone.

56:48.970 --> 56:51.233
Is there anything else you need?

56:54.628 --> 56:56.325
Are you ashamed of me?

56:56.500 --> 56:58.284
No. I'm proud of you.

56:59.590 --> 57:00.939
Why?

57:02.549 --> 57:06.510
You came from nothing, like
me, and now you are an empire.

57:06.684 --> 57:09.861
Empire. Empire?

57:10.035 --> 57:11.776
Is that what it is, Eli? Empire?

57:12.733 --> 57:14.256
It is what you say it is, Jacob.

57:19.087 --> 57:20.828
Loyalty.

57:21.002 --> 57:22.700
Without it, we're nothing.

57:26.225 --> 57:30.098
Tomorrow, we're gonna teach
Alvarez the meaning of loyalty.

57:37.323 --> 57:39.368
Go, I want to be alone.

57:39.543 --> 57:41.109
Go!

57:41.283 --> 57:42.589
Come.

57:46.811 --> 57:48.813
If he leaves this room,
I want to know.

57:48.987 --> 57:50.336
You got it.

58:04.959 --> 58:06.178
I'm afraid.

58:06.352 --> 58:07.962
It's okay.

58:08.136 --> 58:10.051
When you find the connection
to the nukes, you're out.

58:10.225 --> 58:11.531
I'm not sure I can do it.

58:11.705 --> 58:13.794
Ron, you can.

58:13.968 --> 58:15.622
You're gonna be a dad soon.

58:15.796 --> 58:17.755
Do it for your son.

58:33.248 --> 58:37.165
What do you think?
Not quite a size two anymore.

58:37.339 --> 58:39.167
Look what you've done to me.
No.

58:39.341 --> 58:40.821
I like my baby bump.

58:40.995 --> 58:44.782
Uhh! I wish
you were here so you can run to

58:44.956 --> 58:46.000
the store in the middle of the night

58:46.174 --> 58:48.089
and get me graham crackers.

58:48.263 --> 58:52.964
Yeah, graham crackers. No explanation.

58:53.965 --> 58:56.794
So, I started to taper
off my seizure meds.

58:56.968 --> 58:58.970
So far, so good.

58:59.144 --> 59:01.146
The doctor says I have to
reduce the medicine in my blood

59:01.320 --> 59:03.409
before I deliver or it could
have adverse effects on

59:03.583 --> 59:07.544
the baby, but by reducing
my meds, I could...

59:07.718 --> 59:12.461
Well, you get the picture. I'm
sure everything's gonna be fine.

59:12.636 --> 59:14.551
Plus, by the time you see this video, you...

59:14.725 --> 59:18.337
I would've had the baby
and you'd know the results.

59:18.511 --> 59:23.255
Well... I have to be in bed
rest, so let me get back to it.

59:23.908 --> 59:26.911
I can't wait to sit and eat
popcorn or graham crackers

59:27.085 --> 59:29.609
and watch these videos with you.

59:31.829 --> 59:34.179
Okay. Until the next episode.

59:37.095 --> 59:38.662
We're both business men.

59:38.836 --> 59:41.012
I understand this
but I still don't trust him.

59:41.186 --> 59:44.189
Together, we generate
over a billion dollars a year.

59:44.363 --> 59:47.192
His greed is stronger than his pride.

59:47.366 --> 59:49.760
That may be, but you
still have to carry this.

59:49.934 --> 59:51.152
Please carry the gun, Jacob.

59:51.326 --> 59:52.284
We have enough guns.

01:00:07.995 --> 01:00:09.214
They're already here.

01:00:44.162 --> 01:00:45.337
Fuck these games.

01:00:45.511 --> 01:00:47.208
Jacob, wait.

01:00:53.301 --> 01:00:57.001
Alvarez!
You want to talk? Let's talk.

01:01:02.659 --> 01:01:06.097
Alvarez, I'm here! You
want to shoot me? Shoot me!

01:01:36.605 --> 01:01:39.304
Now why would
I want to shoot you, Jacob?

01:01:39.478 --> 01:01:42.873
There are rumors
you're unhappy about my decision

01:01:43.047 --> 01:01:47.529
You are correct. That
decision was not yours to make.

01:01:47.704 --> 01:01:49.662
When someone steals
from me, I have the right to...

01:01:49.836 --> 01:01:50.750
You have no right!

01:01:50.924 --> 01:01:53.884
You took blood from my blood.

01:01:56.321 --> 01:01:58.976
I want ten million dollars.

01:01:59.150 --> 01:02:00.847
Ten million dollars.

01:02:02.327 --> 01:02:04.982
We have a mutually beneficial arrangement.

01:02:06.679 --> 01:02:10.074
One that has made
both of us very rich men.

01:02:10.248 --> 01:02:13.425
But I'll cut off all of
your heads if you think

01:02:13.599 --> 01:02:16.689
for a second you control that arrangement.

01:02:16.863 --> 01:02:20.606
You think your guns bigger than my guns?

01:02:20.780 --> 01:02:23.217
No.

01:02:25.654 --> 01:02:27.831
I think I have more of them.

01:02:35.099 --> 01:02:36.622
Coward.

01:02:36.796 --> 01:02:38.450
Do you really want to go to war with me?

01:02:38.624 --> 01:02:43.585
War? My friend, this is a massacre.

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:46.197
I'm not your friend.

01:02:49.461 --> 01:02:52.116
Send backup. Send backup!

01:02:52.290 --> 01:02:54.205
Negative. It could
jeopardize the operation.

01:02:54.379 --> 01:02:56.598
What's the problem?

01:02:59.732 --> 01:03:03.867
Perhaps we should
resolve this another way.

01:03:04.041 --> 01:03:05.738
What do you have in mind?

01:03:05.912 --> 01:03:08.610
You and me, mano a mano.

01:03:10.525 --> 01:03:11.657
You are something.

01:03:11.831 --> 01:03:13.093
No.

01:03:13.267 --> 01:03:16.227
I pay others to dirty their suits.

01:03:17.184 --> 01:03:20.274
Like this piece of shit?

01:03:20.448 --> 01:03:22.929
Senor Alvarez, it is
obvious that neither of us

01:03:23.103 --> 01:03:25.018
will gain from a blood bath.

01:03:25.192 --> 01:03:25.976
Let's be reasonable and come to...

01:03:32.373 --> 01:03:34.027
For ten million dollars,
I'll kill this piece of shit.

01:03:34.201 --> 01:03:35.507
or he kills me.

01:03:35.681 --> 01:03:36.334
Jacob, don't be stupid.

01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:44.037
What do you say?
It's your decision.

01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:45.098
Ugh... aagh... ugh...

01:04:55.892 --> 01:04:58.677
We are settled.

01:05:04.291 --> 01:05:06.511
I guess your debt is paid off.

01:05:11.516 --> 01:05:12.517
We had a deal!

01:05:12.691 --> 01:05:14.040
I'm altering the deal.

01:05:33.103 --> 01:05:34.278
It's okay, we'll get you out of here.

01:05:34.452 --> 01:05:36.933
Haha! I killed him!

01:05:37.107 --> 01:05:38.891
I killed those mother fuckers!

01:05:44.853 --> 01:05:46.768
Ido, hurry.

01:05:46.943 --> 01:05:48.379
- Hurry where?
- To a hospital!

01:05:48.553 --> 01:05:49.858
Help me, Eli. Help me.

01:05:51.469 --> 01:05:53.123
We can't just pull up to a
hospital and check him in.

01:05:53.297 --> 01:05:54.907
We'll leave him out front.
If we don't, he's going to die.

01:05:55.081 --> 01:05:58.563
Eli, I don't want to die. I have children.

01:05:58.737 --> 01:06:01.392
You're going to be okay,
Daniel, it's going to be okay.

01:06:01.566 --> 01:06:05.962
My boy is nine. He...
He's nine years old.

01:06:06.136 --> 01:06:08.138
He likes soccer.

01:06:08.312 --> 01:06:10.879
Just relax, Daniel.

01:06:11.054 --> 01:06:16.059
He's not very good.
But he tries really hard.

01:06:16.233 --> 01:06:17.234
I'm sure he does fine.

01:06:17.408 --> 01:06:19.801
He... He tries...

01:06:19.976 --> 01:06:22.674
Daniel. Daniel!

01:06:26.417 --> 01:06:30.073
God damn it! Let me out!
Let me out! Let me the fuck out!

01:06:36.035 --> 01:06:38.995
Fuck you. Fuck you.

01:06:41.910 --> 01:06:44.652
Fuck you! Fuck you!

01:06:45.827 --> 01:06:48.526
Fuck your operation!
Jeopardize the operation.

01:06:51.181 --> 01:06:53.574
You don't fucking get it, do you?

01:06:53.748 --> 01:06:56.882
You don't fucking get it.
No matter who we bust,

01:06:57.056 --> 01:06:58.318
no matter who gets killed,

01:06:58.492 --> 01:07:01.017
there is always somebody to replace them!

01:07:04.194 --> 01:07:06.848
I've dedicated
all my life for this. For what?

01:07:09.286 --> 01:07:12.985
You think you can stop this?
You think you can stop evil?

01:07:14.856 --> 01:07:19.557
It's a fucking fantasy.
It's a fucking fantasy.

01:07:23.474 --> 01:07:27.869
I know what's real.
I'll tell you what's real.

01:07:28.044 --> 01:07:31.743
My wife. My wife is real.

01:07:31.917 --> 01:07:34.876
My mother, my son,

01:07:35.051 --> 01:07:38.184
my unborn baby boy.
That's fucking real.

01:07:38.358 --> 01:07:40.056
That's the only thing that's fucking real.

01:07:43.537 --> 01:07:47.150
What now? Huh? What's next?

01:07:47.324 --> 01:07:49.456
I put a smile on my
face and go bury the guys

01:07:49.630 --> 01:07:52.851
that I've been living
with for the last fucking year?

01:07:53.025 --> 01:07:54.461
Go bury their bodies in the...

01:07:54.635 --> 01:07:59.466
...in the field like
we did with Yaniv's? Fuck you.

01:07:59.727 --> 01:08:02.426
I don't know who the
good guys are anymore.

01:08:06.473 --> 01:08:10.129
I sure am not one of...
I sure am not...

01:08:13.001 --> 01:08:15.700
I stood by and watched people burn.

01:08:19.182 --> 01:08:21.532
I stood by and watch people burn, man.

01:08:23.708 --> 01:08:27.668
Even if it's for a greater good,
what does that make me?

01:08:29.583 --> 01:08:31.281
What does that make me?

01:08:36.721 --> 01:08:38.853
Eli, we have to go!

01:08:45.469 --> 01:08:48.950
Yeah. I'll be right out.

01:08:52.258 --> 01:08:54.217
I'll be right out.

01:09:15.586 --> 01:09:18.328
So, story has happy ending.

01:09:24.247 --> 01:09:27.685
I wish I could have been there.
Must have been joy to put bullet

01:09:27.859 --> 01:09:29.730
in that mother fucker's face.

01:09:31.297 --> 01:09:32.951
It was a waste of lead.

01:09:33.125 --> 01:09:34.822
I wanted to do it with my bare hand.

01:09:34.996 --> 01:09:39.044
No. You keep those hands
healthy for counting money, huh?

01:09:39.218 --> 01:09:40.176
I can do that, too.

01:09:43.135 --> 01:09:46.834
To the beginning of a
long, prosperous relationship.

01:09:47.008 --> 01:09:48.184
To our health.

01:09:48.358 --> 01:09:50.186
To our health.

01:09:58.063 --> 01:09:59.195
What?

01:10:08.421 --> 01:10:10.728
Alright, I'll meet you.

01:10:12.251 --> 01:10:14.253
Gentlemen, Mr. Hadar,

01:10:14.427 --> 01:10:18.736
please excuse me. I need to take
care of some pressing business.

01:10:18.910 --> 01:10:21.217
I hope to be back before you leave.

01:10:26.613 --> 01:10:29.921
Something concerns me, Mr. Hadar.

01:10:30.095 --> 01:10:32.053
Are you ready for cartel's retaliation?

01:10:32.228 --> 01:10:36.232
Sergei, tonight, we
speak only of victories.

01:10:36.797 --> 01:10:38.843
I'm just worried
we're being drawn into a war

01:10:39.017 --> 01:10:40.714
we want no part of.

01:10:40.888 --> 01:10:43.587
We are prepared to
deal with any retaliation.

01:10:43.761 --> 01:10:45.763
Are you? Then why did you need

01:10:45.937 --> 01:10:47.721
our assistance to begin with?

01:10:47.895 --> 01:10:52.248
I offered to give help,
as gesture of solidarity.

01:10:52.422 --> 01:10:55.033
With respect to Mr. Hadar,

01:10:55.207 --> 01:10:58.036
What do they offer us?

01:11:02.519 --> 01:11:06.523
I understand and
appreciate Sergei's concern.

01:11:06.697 --> 01:11:11.049
You are a very powerful man, Mr. Ivanov.

01:11:11.223 --> 01:11:14.661
You're the head of a
Fortune 500 company.

01:11:14.835 --> 01:11:18.970
You control a large portion of
your country's banking industry.

01:11:19.144 --> 01:11:23.409
You have the ability to
affect on the world economy.

01:11:23.583 --> 01:11:26.151
And I don't even know why you influence

01:11:26.325 --> 01:11:28.022
professional sport league.

01:11:31.374 --> 01:11:33.071
It is all money, Jacob.

01:11:34.290 --> 01:11:36.770
All these accomplishments,

01:11:36.944 --> 01:11:39.338
they are beyond the vision of most men.

01:11:40.513 --> 01:11:42.341
And I salute you.

01:11:42.515 --> 01:11:44.865
But they are not beyond mine.

01:11:46.519 --> 01:11:49.217
There are many frontiers still to conquer.

01:11:52.351 --> 01:11:57.356
I imagine a future where water,

01:11:57.617 --> 01:12:02.143
power, information, is all
under our control.

01:12:03.971 --> 01:12:08.193
The governments will answer to us.

01:12:08.367 --> 01:12:11.936
There will be no poverty, no war,

01:12:12.110 --> 01:12:14.286
unless we wish it so.

01:12:17.724 --> 01:12:19.770
That is very big vision, friend.

01:12:19.944 --> 01:12:22.207
Perhaps. But possible.

01:12:23.208 --> 01:12:26.472
As a boy, my only
desire was water and food.

01:12:28.779 --> 01:12:31.869
Shoes to cover my bare feet.

01:12:32.043 --> 01:12:36.090
As a young man, I wanted
power and all of its many toys.

01:12:37.265 --> 01:12:39.659
I have accomplished all that

01:12:39.833 --> 01:12:42.532
and I realized what
I really want to be.

01:12:44.925 --> 01:12:46.623
Remembered.

01:12:48.189 --> 01:12:50.844
Not for years like some fading movie star.

01:12:51.932 --> 01:12:54.892
Forever.
Like the Gods.

01:12:57.242 --> 01:12:59.679
Do you think you're a God, Jacob?

01:13:00.288 --> 01:13:02.421
No. I'm merely a man.

01:13:02.595 --> 01:13:07.034
But when we are through,
others will perceive us as Gods.

01:13:30.144 --> 01:13:32.233
Goodbye, Jacob.

01:13:43.593 --> 01:13:45.333
Then that is for Jacob.

01:13:47.335 --> 01:13:49.120
What's this?

01:13:49.294 --> 01:13:51.992
Consider it a gift.

01:14:07.268 --> 01:14:08.574
Let's go.

01:14:13.013 --> 01:14:14.798
You have to find
out what was in that envelope.

01:14:14.972 --> 01:14:16.756
I will.

01:14:16.930 --> 01:14:20.064
Intel believes
Ivanov is the nuclear source.

01:14:20.238 --> 01:14:21.369
Why, because he's Russian?

01:14:24.677 --> 01:14:26.462
What was that?

01:14:26.636 --> 01:14:28.768
Someone banging on the van.
Standby.

01:14:28.942 --> 01:14:30.770
Go ahead, talk to him!

01:14:30.944 --> 01:14:32.685
What are you talking about?
There's no one.

01:14:32.859 --> 01:14:33.338
Hey, I don't know who you guys are but...

01:14:34.861 --> 01:14:36.254
Tell him we know.

01:14:36.428 --> 01:14:37.560
Ron, get out. Get out!

01:14:41.651 --> 01:14:44.915
We are coming for you, you rat bastard.

01:14:51.617 --> 01:14:53.314
Stay cool, stay cool.

01:14:55.839 --> 01:14:56.927
Hey.

01:14:57.101 --> 01:14:58.145
How you doing, Eli?

01:15:09.853 --> 01:15:11.855
Patrol Three ambushed a couple feds.

01:15:12.029 --> 01:15:13.596
Why arent you with Jacob?

01:15:13.770 --> 01:15:15.249
I thought I heard a
scuffle in the hallway.

01:15:16.512 --> 01:15:19.732
Are there anymore of them? We
should do a sweep of the entire

01:15:19.906 --> 01:15:22.692
compound, right now. Let's go.

01:15:22.866 --> 01:15:24.041
You were my brother!

01:15:24.215 --> 01:15:25.346
Ido, what are you doing?

01:15:26.217 --> 01:15:28.088
Ido, lower the gun!

01:15:29.525 --> 01:15:30.351
Ido, what is this?

01:15:33.441 --> 01:15:34.617
Is he a fed?

01:15:34.791 --> 01:15:36.880
Tie him up.

01:15:43.669 --> 01:15:46.454
Well, we're getting close.

01:15:46.629 --> 01:15:48.456
Any day now and you're gonna be a daddy.

01:15:48.631 --> 01:15:51.329
So, I guess this is the season finale.

01:15:56.116 --> 01:16:00.033
I wanted to tell you that I understand.

01:16:06.953 --> 01:16:09.173
If anything goes wrong
for me, with the delivery,

01:16:12.002 --> 01:16:14.918
I wanted you to know that I
believe in what you're doing.

01:16:15.092 --> 01:16:19.923
I know I haven't said
that to you in a while.

01:16:20.097 --> 01:16:24.623
But this last year has been so hard and

01:16:24.797 --> 01:16:28.366
you've always been there to take
care of me. But I've managed.

01:16:31.674 --> 01:16:33.371
And I realize how hard it must be on you.

01:16:37.941 --> 01:16:41.248
But what you're doing is so much
bigger than the both of us.

01:16:41.422 --> 01:16:44.904
You're making this world a
better place for everyone.

01:16:45.078 --> 01:16:48.212
So, no matter what happens...

01:16:48.386 --> 01:16:50.518
I want you to know I think you're a hero.

01:16:50.693 --> 01:16:53.130
Our son is going to be so proud of you.

01:16:53.304 --> 01:16:57.221
I'm so proud of you.
I love you, Ronnie.

01:16:59.353 --> 01:17:02.052
From the bottom of my heart.
I love you.

01:17:17.328 --> 01:17:19.852
Welcome, my friend.

01:17:20.026 --> 01:17:23.290
Ivanov was wise to increase security.

01:17:23.464 --> 01:17:26.163
One musor can ruin the entire party.

01:17:29.035 --> 01:17:32.430
When I killed Yaniv, part of me also died.

01:17:34.737 --> 01:17:37.740
The part that believed
loyalty was possible.

01:17:39.959 --> 01:17:44.050
That was my brother and he betrayed me.

01:17:44.224 --> 01:17:47.837
Yaniv died from greed.

01:17:48.011 --> 01:17:51.536
An affliction that affects all men.

01:17:51.710 --> 01:17:53.799
And you...

01:17:53.973 --> 01:17:57.107
You're gonna die for a cause.

01:17:57.281 --> 01:18:00.414
Trying to rid the world of bad men.

01:18:00.588 --> 01:18:03.853
It can't happen. See?

01:18:04.027 --> 01:18:08.118
Your cause, like all causes,

01:18:08.292 --> 01:18:12.992
are meant for the mind of young boys

01:18:13.297 --> 01:18:17.301
who don't know any better.

01:18:17.475 --> 01:18:20.391
When you die, no one will remember.

01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:26.179
Jacob had a great vision.

01:18:26.353 --> 01:18:27.790
- Ido.
- He was out of control.

01:18:27.964 --> 01:18:31.663
Please. Untie me and give me your gun.

01:18:32.664 --> 01:18:33.883
- You can't control
- This place

01:18:34.057 --> 01:18:35.319
- the world.
- will be overrun

01:18:35.493 --> 01:18:36.799
- with agents
- Others have tried

01:18:36.973 --> 01:18:38.191
- in 5 minutes!
- and failed.

01:18:38.365 --> 01:18:40.933
It is insolent!
No man can be God!

01:18:41.107 --> 01:18:42.892
Ido, listen to me.

01:18:43.066 --> 01:18:46.156
If you come in with me, I can help you.

01:18:46.330 --> 01:18:49.159
If you testify,
I can still help you.

01:18:49.333 --> 01:18:53.729
I'm sorry, that's something I will not do.

01:18:53.903 --> 01:18:58.821
Listen to me. My
friend, you don't have a choice.

01:18:59.082 --> 01:19:01.780
You do not have a choice.

01:19:03.956 --> 01:19:06.480
You always have a choice.

01:19:06.654 --> 01:19:11.224
No, no! Ido! Ido! Ido!
Aaagh!!! Aaagh! Aaagh!

01:19:11.398 --> 01:19:16.099
