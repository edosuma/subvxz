14:07.414 --> 14:10.366
I got my eyes on this sweet
bottle in House Romero.

14:10.417 --> 14:12.702
She drinks this stuff like it's water.

14:12.753 --> 14:13.870
Alex is gone.

14:13.921 --> 14:16.122
Ah, another joyride outside the walls.

14:16.173 --> 14:17.256
Even all of his stuff...

14:17.291 --> 14:20.426
his duffel, his AR-15... it's all gone.

14:20.461 --> 14:23.346
Maybe he's finally doing
some spring cleaning.

14:23.380 --> 14:26.633
Ethan, he was a no-show
for his security rotation.

14:26.684 --> 14:28.351
This isn't Alex. Something's wrong.

14:28.385 --> 14:30.553
You know, I saw him with
Michael after the funeral.

14:30.555 --> 14:33.022
Now, I didn't hear what they were saying,

14:33.057 --> 14:34.974
but I've never seen Alex
look at him that way.

14:35.025 --> 14:36.859
I don't think this has
anything to do with Michael.

14:36.894 --> 14:38.728
I'm gonna go to talk him.

14:38.779 --> 14:41.397
To an archangel? You
really want to do that?

14:41.448 --> 14:42.649
My friend disappeared.

14:42.700 --> 14:45.485
Got to do something.

14:45.536 --> 14:46.903
Yeah.

14:46.905 --> 14:48.871
You are prohibited from
selling merchandise...

14:48.906 --> 14:51.991
Good morning.

14:52.042 --> 14:54.577
Lady Riesen, for you.

14:54.628 --> 14:56.079
Thank you. You're so sweet.

14:56.081 --> 14:57.797
Thank you.

14:57.831 --> 15:01.300
There you are.

15:01.335 --> 15:02.669
Where are your guards?

15:02.720 --> 15:05.338
The attack was on Alex, not me.

15:05.389 --> 15:08.391
I'm not gonna hide under my bed.

15:10.177 --> 15:14.263
Any news from Alex?

15:14.314 --> 15:15.264
No.

15:15.315 --> 15:18.151
He, um...

15:18.185 --> 15:21.104
I don't think he's coming back.

15:21.106 --> 15:23.106
Maybe not.

15:23.157 --> 15:25.525
Maybe his destiny lies outside these walls.

15:25.576 --> 15:29.612
That doesn't mean to say
he still can't save us.

15:29.663 --> 15:33.449
Look, Claire.

15:33.451 --> 15:34.834
About the jubilee,

15:34.868 --> 15:36.619
I had no idea our fathers

15:36.670 --> 15:38.087
were gonna make that announcement.

15:38.122 --> 15:39.088
- If I...
- William.

15:39.123 --> 15:41.541
It's fine, okay?

15:41.592 --> 15:44.627
My point is

15:44.629 --> 15:46.796
I never had any friends apart from you,

15:46.798 --> 15:49.382
and I don't want it to
break up our friendship.

15:49.433 --> 15:51.434
William, I'm still your friend.

15:51.468 --> 15:56.055
It doesn't have to stop there.

15:56.106 --> 15:58.107
I have to go. I'm sorry.

15:58.142 --> 16:01.477
I'm sorry, okay?

16:05.816 --> 16:06.816
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

16:06.867 --> 16:09.402
Thanks.

16:23.967 --> 16:26.252
Louis?

16:26.303 --> 16:28.221
You have to believe me.

16:28.255 --> 16:31.924
I had no idea Felicia
was siding with Gabriel.

16:31.975 --> 16:33.342
None of us did.

16:33.344 --> 16:35.344
I'm not accusing you.

16:35.346 --> 16:37.013
I need your help

16:37.015 --> 16:38.848
to keep an eye out for infiltrators.

16:38.899 --> 16:42.435
I can't tell an angel from a
human any more than you can.

16:42.486 --> 16:45.188
Then keep an eye on the ones you do know.

16:45.190 --> 16:47.490
I understand you not wanting
to go against your fellow angel.

16:47.524 --> 16:50.193
You're refugees from a
war you had no part of.

16:50.244 --> 16:52.195
That's why I respected your neutrality.

16:52.197 --> 16:55.581
I kept your secret.

16:55.616 --> 16:58.201
But times have changed.

16:58.203 --> 17:00.536
Tell the others.

17:00.587 --> 17:03.539
Stand with me, or leave Vega.

17:06.844 --> 17:08.294
Archangel?

17:08.345 --> 17:09.345
Sergeant.

17:09.378 --> 17:11.047
- Mack.
- I know who you are.

17:11.049 --> 17:12.765
Sorry to bother you.

17:12.800 --> 17:14.433
I really don't know why
I'm sweating so much.

17:14.468 --> 17:17.854
Are you sweating? Do angels sweat?

17:20.307 --> 17:22.058
Alex is a good kid.

17:22.108 --> 17:23.893
A little hotheaded, sure.

17:23.944 --> 17:26.061
But if you sent him away somewhere...

17:26.113 --> 17:27.563
Why would you think that?

17:27.565 --> 17:28.731
He's been gone for 12 hours,

17:28.733 --> 17:30.149
missed his security rotation into Whele,

17:30.200 --> 17:31.567
hasn't even checked on Bix.

17:31.569 --> 17:33.903
Sergeant Lannon's left the city?

17:33.954 --> 17:36.239
You didn't know that?

17:36.241 --> 17:39.075
[Gasps]

17:44.298 --> 17:46.582

17:46.633 --> 17:49.969

Sophia?

17:51.555 --> 17:53.923
Tobias?

17:53.974 --> 17:56.008
Lady Riesen, the Principate
sent us to find...

17:56.059 --> 17:57.810
Two of my students live
here. Look at this place.

17:57.845 --> 17:58.928
What the hell is going on?

17:58.979 --> 18:00.596
If the Blues are gonna toss the place,

18:00.647 --> 18:01.597
they could at least
clean up after themselves.

18:01.648 --> 18:02.849
The Blues did this?

18:02.900 --> 18:04.483
How do you know that?

18:04.518 --> 18:07.153
Sergeant, I want to know
what happened to my students,

18:07.187 --> 18:08.271
and I want to know now.

18:08.322 --> 18:10.439
Anyone who had contact with Felicia Aldreen

18:10.490 --> 18:11.774
has been taken in for questioning.

18:11.825 --> 18:14.660
Who gave these orders?

18:14.695 --> 18:16.779
I will not wait till the next attack

18:16.830 --> 18:18.281
to find out who our enemies are.

18:18.283 --> 18:21.918
So you're rounding up
innocent families, children?

18:21.952 --> 18:23.452
Jeep's assassin was a child.

18:23.454 --> 18:25.421
Yes, but people are already on edge,

18:25.455 --> 18:27.790
scared of their neighbors,
not sure who they can trust.

18:27.792 --> 18:30.209
- Do you really think this helps?
- Absolutely.

18:30.260 --> 18:33.796
It shows that we are taking
steps to protect them.

18:33.847 --> 18:36.515
This isn't about
protection. This is politics.

18:36.550 --> 18:38.217
You're under fire for allowing

18:38.268 --> 18:39.936
a higher angel to hide in our home.

18:39.970 --> 18:43.306
So to divert attention, you
order a massive response.

18:43.357 --> 18:47.476
The great General Riesen
comes to the rescue again.

18:47.527 --> 18:52.148
Those families are back home
by now, questioned and released.

18:52.150 --> 18:54.116
Well, that makes me feel much better.

18:54.151 --> 18:56.535
You were within inches of being killed.

18:56.570 --> 18:58.321
- I will not sit back and...
- No!

18:58.323 --> 19:01.407
Don't you dare use me to justify
the detention of innocent V-1s.

19:01.458 --> 19:04.160
Don't you dare!

19:04.211 --> 19:06.295
What do you want me to do, Claire?

19:06.330 --> 19:09.916
I want you to treat them
like people, not numbers.

19:14.171 --> 19:16.839
If you want to change
the way things are done,

19:16.841 --> 19:18.007
marry William.

19:18.009 --> 19:20.893
[Sighs]

19:27.901 --> 19:30.686
What is it you're not telling me?

19:30.737 --> 19:33.990
You can fool your friends
in the senate, Dad,

19:34.024 --> 19:37.326
but you can't fool me.

19:37.361 --> 19:40.112
What is it?

19:51.675 --> 19:56.212
I'm sick, Claire.

20:09.609 --> 20:11.811
You've got to be kidding me.

20:18.568 --> 20:20.870
[Tires screech]

20:26.576 --> 20:27.743
Where are you going?

20:27.794 --> 20:30.546
I thought I made myself clear.

20:30.580 --> 20:32.048
Leave me alone!

20:32.082 --> 20:33.466
I've done that for far too long.

20:33.500 --> 20:35.217
Michael, I never needed your help.

20:35.252 --> 20:36.669
I don't need it now.

20:36.720 --> 20:40.589
You don't have a choice.

20:40.640 --> 20:43.175
What the hell do you think you're doing?

20:43.226 --> 20:46.562
Calling shotgun.

20:53.977 --> 20:57.029
[Gun cocks]

20:57.063 --> 20:59.565
Get out of the car, now.

20:59.616 --> 21:03.652
That's not going to happen.

21:03.703 --> 21:04.987
I'll ask again.

21:05.038 --> 21:06.205
Shame for you to lose that hand.

21:06.239 --> 21:09.241
Is that a threat?

21:09.292 --> 21:10.242
A warning.

21:10.293 --> 21:12.128
I've been shot many times.

21:12.162 --> 21:13.379
Bullets have a way

21:13.413 --> 21:14.997
of doing more damage to
the person firing them

21:15.048 --> 21:17.883
than they've ever been able to do to me.

21:20.504 --> 21:24.256
[Grunts]

21:24.307 --> 21:27.476
I'm going to New Delphi,
and I'm going alone.

21:27.511 --> 21:29.562
You have no idea what awaits you there.

21:29.596 --> 21:32.398
Want to know what awaits me there?

21:32.432 --> 21:33.432
A life.

21:33.434 --> 21:36.185
My life away from you,

21:36.236 --> 21:39.104
away from anyone telling
me who I'm supposed to be.

21:39.156 --> 21:41.657
So let's figure it out right now.

21:41.691 --> 21:44.243
What's it gonna take for
you to leave me alone?

21:44.277 --> 21:47.446
One stop.

21:47.497 --> 21:49.448
One stop where?

21:49.450 --> 21:52.451
Better you learn when we arrive.

21:54.204 --> 21:55.621
Okay.

21:55.623 --> 21:58.457
I make this stop with you, this one stop,

21:58.459 --> 22:01.126
and then you let me go on my way.

22:01.178 --> 22:03.429
Alone.

22:03.463 --> 22:06.298
- Deal.
- Deal.

22:09.386 --> 22:13.022

proposal for a subcommittee

22:13.056 --> 22:15.024
to review food supply contingencies.

22:15.058 --> 22:18.310
Way to go.

22:18.361 --> 22:21.146
And, Becca, one more thing.

22:21.148 --> 22:25.317
About our friend Michael,
I understand he's not able

22:25.368 --> 22:26.535
to I.D. these higher angels.

22:26.570 --> 22:28.320
But I was thinking,

22:28.322 --> 22:31.240
Michael has the ability to
appear perfectly human too.

22:31.291 --> 22:34.326
What if we understood the archangel more,

22:34.328 --> 22:36.128
his vulnerabilities?

22:36.162 --> 22:38.330
It would prepare us better
to counter this new threat,

22:38.332 --> 22:39.999
don't you think?

22:40.001 --> 22:43.052
As a scientist, I mean.

22:43.086 --> 22:45.170
Michael's not gonna put
himself under a microscope.

22:45.172 --> 22:47.423
Oh.

22:47.474 --> 22:48.674
But why don't you ask him yourself?

22:48.725 --> 22:51.093
I'm sure he'd love to sit down for coffee.

22:51.144 --> 22:52.144
Did you miss the part where he threatened

22:52.178 --> 22:53.145
to murder me today?

22:53.179 --> 22:55.514
No, I caught that.

22:55.516 --> 22:58.400
I was actually thinking
you could run point.

22:58.435 --> 23:01.820
You know, in your position, I figure

23:01.855 --> 23:07.526
you might have access to
privileged information.

important thing in his life.
