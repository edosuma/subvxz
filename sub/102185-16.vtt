I'm proof that everything
works out all right.

41:13.095 --> 41:14.805
We both are.

41:15.973 --> 41:17.516
- You...

41:17.558 --> 41:19.560
you and Iris?

41:19.602 --> 41:21.896
- Not--not exactly.

41:21.937 --> 41:23.314
Um...

41:23.355 --> 41:24.899
But, uh--hey!

41:24.940 --> 41:27.193
I mean, if you're happy
to see me,

41:27.234 --> 41:29.778
you're gonna be twice as happy

41:29.820 --> 41:31.363
in just a second.

41:32.490 --> 41:33.449
[whooshes]

41:33.491 --> 41:35.159
- Whoo!

41:36.035 --> 41:38.162
Hoo! What did I miss?

41:38.204 --> 41:40.331
- Dad, meet your son, Bart.

41:40.372 --> 41:42.374
- Hey, Dad!
What's good?

41:42.416 --> 41:43.959
Or "Pops."
Can I call you Pops yet?

41:44.001 --> 41:45.336
You like it when I call you
Pops later.

41:45.377 --> 41:46.670
I can't remember
when that is, though.

41:46.712 --> 41:49.465
Yo, this place is crash!

42:15.950 --> 42:17.535
- Greg, move your head.
