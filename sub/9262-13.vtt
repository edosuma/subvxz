Previously on "the shield"...

00:02.405 --> 00:04.140
Shane need someone
to kill you,

00:04.141 --> 00:05.407
'cause he was waiting
to kill me.

00:05.408 --> 00:07.476
Gardocki: claudette knows we're
gonna be gunning after him.

00:07.477 --> 00:10.136
We just walked vic and a bag
of dirty money into a bust.

00:10.137 --> 00:11.504
Vic: code red.

00:11.505 --> 00:12.468
There's a package.

00:12.469 --> 00:13.370
You know what to do.

00:13.371 --> 00:14.273
This is for you.

00:14.274 --> 00:16.519
Ronnie is
his goddamn errand boy.

00:16.520 --> 00:19.155
What if vic figured out
that I was working with you?

00:19.156 --> 00:21.111
Get this money out of here,
okay?

00:21.112 --> 00:22.780
Keep it.

00:22.781 --> 00:25.250
aah!

00:25.251 --> 00:26.615
ugh!

00:26.616 --> 00:27.786
My shoulder!

00:27.787 --> 00:27.930
ohh!

00:27.931 --> 00:30.633
It's like a knife
in my chest.

00:30.634 --> 00:31.491
Just take me home.

00:31.492 --> 00:33.436
Shane is broke
with an injured, pregnant wife

00:33.437 --> 00:35.501
who just killed her last shot
at getting out of this.

00:35.502 --> 00:37.997
My wife
is not going to jail.

00:37.998 --> 00:39.566
We got to get i.c.e.

00:39.567 --> 00:40.576
To start cutting us deals now.

00:40.577 --> 00:42.001
Not without a big
cartel takedown.

00:42.002 --> 00:43.470
Murray:
the goal is getting beltran

00:43.471 --> 00:45.114
to trust you to the point
where you have access

00:45.115 --> 00:45.779
to the cartel's inner workings.

00:45.780 --> 00:49.009
I've arranged a meet and
greet with you and the

00:49.010 --> 00:50.039
black board of directors.

00:50.040 --> 00:51.007
I don't meet and greet.

00:51.008 --> 00:52.154
I'd be happy
to negotiate terms.

00:52.155 --> 00:54.012
This ain't no proposal.

00:54.013 --> 00:54.878
This is a gank and grab.

00:54.879 --> 00:55.848
Buy-in's 200 large.

00:55.849 --> 00:57.345
Murray:
I couldn't get washington

00:57.346 --> 00:58.916
to sign off on ronnie this fast.

00:58.917 --> 00:59.794
vic:
I don't want half a deal.

00:59.795 --> 01:02.522
When you can offer the same
thing at the same time to

01:02.523 --> 01:03.523
ronnie, then you call me.

01:03.524 --> 01:04.824
Are you gonna arrest vic?

01:04.825 --> 01:05.688
You need to end this now.

01:05.689 --> 01:06.332
What did mara say?

01:06.333 --> 01:07.836
That she and shane
are coming for the money.

01:07.837 --> 01:10.706
I'll meet with you
to pick up the cash.

01:10.707 --> 01:12.498
The cops are there, corrine.

01:12.499 --> 01:13.208
They're watching you.

01:13.209 --> 01:15.597
If we don't have vic on tape,
we got nothing.

01:15.598 --> 01:16.878
How do I explain
all this money?

01:16.879 --> 01:18.345
Sofer: corrine mackey,
you're under arrest.

01:18.346 --> 01:20.803
We got to go through the
motions. Vic may be watching.

01:20.804 --> 01:21.547
vic:
Give me that deal.

01:21.548 --> 01:23.608
You give my ex-wife
a pass on this one

01:23.609 --> 01:25.746
aiding and abetting
and I'll give you beltran

01:25.747 --> 01:26.722
and the whole goddamn cartel.

01:26.723 --> 01:28.278
I can't do anything
for ronnie yet.

01:28.279 --> 01:29.992
Ronnie can wait
until after the bust.

01:29.993 --> 01:32.528
Our strike team was committing
criminal acts

01:32.529 --> 01:33.093
on a regular basis.

01:33.094 --> 01:34.962
What kind of deal
did you give him?

01:34.963 --> 01:38.158
Full immunity on everything
he confesses to.

01:38.159 --> 01:41.995
I shot and killed
detective terry crowley.

01:41.996 --> 01:44.730
He gave up ronnie,
and we're gonna catch shane.

01:44.731 --> 01:45.007
But vic!

01:45.008 --> 01:48.264
You're fired, you sanctimonious
son of a bitch!

01:48.265 --> 01:48.774
This isn't you.

01:48.775 --> 01:51.068
Anything less than
the biggest drug bust

01:51.069 --> 01:52.772
this agency's ever seen
will violate your deal.

01:52.773 --> 01:53.182
Don't worry.

01:53.183 --> 01:55.483
I'll give you beltran
and his entire organization.

01:55.484 --> 01:57.508
You've implicated gardocki
in enough shit

01:57.509 --> 02:00.048
to put him away
for the rest of his life.

02:00.049 --> 02:01.724
I need him
to take down beltran.

02:01.725 --> 02:05.333
I'll string him along
until we're done.

with shane go?

02:57.571 --> 02:59.848
Cops were set up
all over corrine.

02:59.849 --> 03:02.874
Must have tapped
her phone.

03:02.875 --> 03:03.484
They arrested her?

03:03.485 --> 03:07.413
She posted bail
an hour ago.

03:07.414 --> 03:07.790
Oh, christ.

03:07.791 --> 03:12.413
I reached out to olivia again,
gave her the hard sell.

03:12.414 --> 03:12.984
and?

03:12.985 --> 03:16.263
She agreed to put something
on paper for both of us,

03:16.264 --> 03:21.328
clear corrine of this, too,
effective as soon as

03:21.329 --> 03:26.064
the beltran bust goes down.

03:26.065 --> 03:28.233
Full immunity for us?

03:28.234 --> 03:30.101
Holy shit.

03:30.102 --> 03:30.711
That's great news.

03:30.712 --> 03:34.983
Hey, let's go feed beltran
the bait.

03:34.984 --> 03:36.585
Beltran: why is my presence
necessary?

03:36.586 --> 03:39.445
These guys want some
face time with their

03:39.446 --> 03:40.880
new business partner
on their first

03:40.881 --> 03:41.281
transaction.

03:41.282 --> 03:43.313
They're ponying up
a shitload of cash.

03:43.314 --> 03:44.657
Gardocki:
this isn't mexico city.

03:44.658 --> 03:46.051
You got to earn trust
up here.

03:46.052 --> 03:48.354
Trust is all the drugs
i'm putting in black hands.

03:48.355 --> 03:50.354
It's a respect thing.

03:50.355 --> 03:51.724
I'll make it quick and painless.

03:51.725 --> 03:52.167
It better be.

03:52.168 --> 03:56.261
Otherwise, I'll promise you
the opposite.

03:56.262 --> 03:57.628
When?

03:57.629 --> 03:58.105
Noon tomorrow.

03:58.106 --> 03:59.799
We're gonna do this
in broad daylight?

03:59.800 --> 04:02.401
I told you,air force one
is landing at l.a.x.

04:02.402 --> 04:02.978
In the afternoon.

04:02.979 --> 04:04.603
80% of the cops
in this city

04:04.604 --> 04:13.178
will be deployed
on the west side.

04:13.179 --> 04:13.712
It's wide open.

04:13.713 --> 04:19.750
Vic cut a deal
with the feds.

04:19.750 --> 04:20.851
Full immunity for you.

04:20.853 --> 04:21.853
I don't need immunity.

04:21.855 --> 04:26.035
Yeah, vic
doesn't know that.

04:26.036 --> 04:31.196
He also got full immunity
for himself.

04:31.197 --> 04:31.431
What?!

04:31.432 --> 04:34.033
He can't be charged
with anything, corrine,

04:34.034 --> 04:36.445
and he confessed
to some heinous shit

04:36.446 --> 04:39.078
you don't even want
to hear.

04:39.079 --> 04:41.250
But he can't be charged
for any of it?

04:41.251 --> 04:44.877
He leveraged a bust they needed
him on into a deal.

04:44.878 --> 04:47.881
They had no idea
the nightmare they were

04:47.882 --> 04:51.317
getting themselves into.

04:51.318 --> 04:52.194
He's free...of everything.

04:52.195 --> 04:56.286
We're arresting ronnie
in the barn tomorrow,

04:56.287 --> 04:57.056
after vic's bust, okay?

04:57.057 --> 05:00.969
Vic has his whole life
to figure out what I did to him.

05:00.970 --> 05:04.760
What is going to happen to me
when he realizes it?!

05:04.761 --> 05:05.304
We have an idea.

05:05.305 --> 05:07.663
You have an idea?!

05:07.664 --> 05:10.665
I have children!

05:10.666 --> 05:11.667
What am I gonna do?!

05:11.668 --> 05:16.583
Sewell:
okay, buddy, we're home.

05:16.584 --> 05:20.308
[ doorknob rattles,
door opens ]

05:20.309 --> 05:29.921
here we go.

05:29.922 --> 05:33.957
I'm gonna play
with that big dump truck.

05:33.958 --> 05:34.560
Okay.

05:34.561 --> 05:35.270
Is that a dump truck?

05:35.271 --> 05:36.192
It's in your room, honey.

05:36.193 --> 05:36.936
Go in your room, okay?

05:36.937 --> 05:39.460
Go ahead.

05:39.461 --> 05:45.367
Go on.

05:45.368 --> 05:47.337
Jackson: mommy?

05:47.338 --> 05:47.839
Shane?

05:47.840 --> 05:48.807
What?

05:48.808 --> 05:49.184
What, baby?

05:49.185 --> 05:56.778
What's gonna happen to him...

05:56.779 --> 05:59.647
When they catch us?

05:59.648 --> 06:00.249
Nothing.

06:00.250 --> 06:04.889
Nothing,
'cause they're not.

06:04.890 --> 06:05.424
Come on.

06:05.425 --> 06:07.756
All right.

06:07.757 --> 06:10.329
We're just resting here.

06:10.330 --> 06:10.839
All right, now.

06:10.840 --> 06:13.208
I am, uh, gonna get you
to feeling better,

06:13.209 --> 06:17.470
and, uh, uh, tomorrow morning,
when the prez hits town

06:17.471 --> 06:19.212
and all the unis
are rolling west side,

06:19.213 --> 06:23.876
we're gonna hit the road
once and for all.

06:23.877 --> 06:33.285
I can't take
a car trip, shane.

06:33.286 --> 06:33.819
Sure, you can.

06:33.820 --> 06:36.732
My mother won't
take jackson in --

06:36.733 --> 06:39.558
Not that I want that bitch
anywhere near him.

06:39.559 --> 06:43.495
There's no one
in your family.

06:43.496 --> 06:47.963
They're gonna put him
in foster care, aren't they?

06:47.964 --> 06:50.198
no.

06:50.199 --> 06:51.467
Don't lie to me, shane.

06:51.468 --> 06:57.774
They're gonna put him
in foster care.

06:57.775 --> 06:58.342
Oh, god.

06:58.343 --> 06:59.812
ohh!

06:59.813 --> 07:01.842
What, baby?

07:01.843 --> 07:06.750
What's wrong?

07:06.751 --> 07:07.618
Here.

07:07.619 --> 07:09.254
Jackson: mommy!

07:09.255 --> 07:11.690
mm.

07:11.691 --> 07:16.028
I'll be right there, baby!

07:16.029 --> 07:20.266
What's he gonna think of us
when he finds out?

07:20.267 --> 07:25.604
When they tell him
who his real parents are?

07:25.605 --> 07:28.838
I'm not gonna --
What's he gonna think?

07:28.839 --> 07:31.953
I'm not gonna let
any of that happen.

07:31.954 --> 07:43.020
You got to get these disaster
fantasies out of your head.

07:43.021 --> 07:44.656
And our daughter?

07:44.657 --> 07:44.766
no.

07:44.767 --> 07:46.702
I'll give birth to her
in a prison,

07:46.703 --> 07:49.662
and they'll take her
away from me.

07:49.663 --> 07:53.371
They're gonna rip her away
from me, aren't they?

07:53.372 --> 07:57.134
Baby, she's always
gonna be ours.

07:57.135 --> 08:00.572
Let -- let's name her...

08:00.573 --> 08:00.749
Okay?

08:00.750 --> 08:03.674
Before anybody else can,
let's --

08:03.675 --> 08:05.473
Let's give her a name.

08:05.474 --> 08:06.344
Okay.

08:06.345 --> 08:11.215
What do you want
to name her?

08:11.216 --> 08:11.578
Frances.

08:11.579 --> 08:13.818
Frances?

08:13.819 --> 08:15.117
Yeah.

08:15.118 --> 08:16.988
Frances what?

08:16.989 --> 08:18.690
Frances abigail.

08:18.691 --> 08:20.565
Whenever she does
something cute,

08:20.566 --> 08:24.173
we can call her
franny abby.

08:51.604 --> 08:52.372
Morning, captain.

08:52.373 --> 08:54.576
Good morning.

08:54.577 --> 08:55.677
We've got business to do.

08:55.678 --> 08:56.078
We sure do.

08:56.079 --> 09:00.311
I left some papers
on your desk to sign.

09:00.312 --> 09:01.414
W- what are you doing here?

09:01.415 --> 09:02.694
Seems like
i'm in the right spot.

09:02.695 --> 09:07.363
I heard the doctor tell you last
night, "no stress, stay home."

09:07.364 --> 09:08.521
Didn't I fire you?

09:08.522 --> 09:09.256
It didn't take.

09:09.257 --> 09:09.932
Immunity for mackey.

09:09.933 --> 09:12.938
I've got to do something
about...something.

09:12.939 --> 09:13.569
That ship has sailed.

09:13.570 --> 09:16.241
You need to take care
of yourselfnow.

09:16.242 --> 09:18.476
Oh, my doctor's prescribed
some new meds.

09:18.477 --> 09:21.511
They seem to be working,
and I still got business.

09:21.512 --> 09:23.437
I'm on the clock,
so make it quick.

09:23.438 --> 09:27.009
We need you to put
corrine mackey and her kids

09:27.010 --> 09:28.076
in federal witness protection.

09:28.077 --> 09:28.886
And why would I do that?

09:28.887 --> 09:32.090
Because she's been helping us
make a case against vic.

09:32.091 --> 09:35.247
Then you set her up somewhere,
on your nickel.

09:35.248 --> 09:36.694
Vic's local reach
is too dangerous.

09:36.695 --> 09:39.696
And we can't control him,
since you've given him immunity

09:39.697 --> 09:41.866
for every depraved act
he ever committed.

09:41.867 --> 09:44.702
Exactly. So why would I do him
this one last favor?

09:44.703 --> 09:46.670
Because it's a favor for me,
not him.

09:46.671 --> 09:48.503
Because corrine and her kids
need protection

09:48.504 --> 09:50.106
in case he finds out
that she helped us.

09:50.107 --> 09:56.770
And he's your monster now
and you want to hurt him,

09:56.771 --> 09:58.038
and this is a way to do that.

09:58.039 --> 09:59.505
hey.

09:59.506 --> 10:01.373
Hey, kids.

10:01.374 --> 10:01.673
Hey, dad.

10:01.674 --> 10:04.446
Listen, I'm sorry
about the arrest.

10:04.447 --> 10:05.056
Well, I'm out now.

10:05.057 --> 10:07.112
Did they treat you
all right?

10:07.113 --> 10:09.485
I just want
to forget about it.

10:09.486 --> 10:10.228
Well, good news, then.

10:10.229 --> 10:12.382
I took care of it.

10:12.383 --> 10:13.988
It's all over.

10:13.989 --> 10:14.323
how?

10:14.324 --> 10:16.358

You've been cleared
of any wrongdoing in return.

10:19.836 --> 10:20.596
Are you gonna be okay?

10:20.597 --> 10:22.974
Oh, yeah, I'm --
I'm gonna be good.

10:22.975 --> 10:26.836
I just wanted to check in
with you and the kids,

10:26.837 --> 10:30.337

Hi, beautiful.

10:37.280 --> 10:37.455
Mwah!

Hey, you want me to drop you off
at soccer on my way?

I'm just offering.

Holy shit.

Let's just have a civil
conversation so I don't have

11:17.950 --> 11:19.154
to pull out my gun, okay?

11:19.155 --> 11:19.655
Sounds good.

11:19.656 --> 11:22.801
'cause I'll do it,
and you know that, right?

11:22.802 --> 11:25.560
They're saying some pretty awful
things about you, shane.

11:25.561 --> 11:27.271
Well, I did
some pretty awful shit, steve.

11:27.272 --> 11:29.572
I need you to deliver a message
to claudette for me.

11:29.573 --> 11:33.510
That woman that mara shot
was in self-defense.

11:33.511 --> 11:34.169
Yeah, well, that woman died.

11:34.170 --> 11:36.714
They were trying
to kick the shit out of me.

11:36.715 --> 11:37.415
Okay? Mara was defending me.

Those guys are saying
that you tried to roll them.

11:39.209 --> 11:40.415
I'm just trying
to be truthful with you.

11:40.416 --> 11:41.940
I don't give a shit
what they said.

11:41.941 --> 11:42.510
I'm sorry, okay?

11:42.511 --> 11:45.781
I don't give a shit
what they said, steve! Okay?

11:45.782 --> 11:46.524
Mara's not a criminal.

11:46.525 --> 11:49.114
If you were committing
a crime, mara can't

11:49.115 --> 11:49.784
claim self-defense.

11:49.785 --> 11:53.585
Look, I'm not asking
for your legal opinion, steve.

11:53.586 --> 11:54.486
Just deliver the message.

11:54.487 --> 11:57.100
Mara was acting
in self-defense...

11:57.101 --> 11:59.034
And she hasn't wanted to do
any of this shit.

11:59.035 --> 12:01.963
She only did it because
she didn't have a choice.

12:01.964 --> 12:02.673
She was scared of me.

12:02.674 --> 12:07.897
She was scared for her life,
and she did what I made her do.

12:07.898 --> 12:08.901
Okay.

12:08.902 --> 12:11.170
Okay.

12:11.171 --> 12:11.937
Uh, this is a lawyer.

12:11.938 --> 12:13.741
You tell claudette,
if she wants me

12:13.742 --> 12:15.774
to turn myself in today,
i'd testify to everything

12:15.775 --> 12:17.776
that she needs
to put vic and ronnie

12:17.777 --> 12:18.720
in prison forever and a day.

12:18.721 --> 12:20.456
All she has to do
is call that guy

12:20.457 --> 12:22.893
and guarantee that mara
does not do any time.

12:22.894 --> 12:25.660
Now, I'll check in with him
in four hours.

12:25.661 --> 12:27.053
And as soon as I get
the word

12:27.054 --> 12:29.555
that mara is clear
of any and all charges...

12:29.556 --> 12:32.327
I'll walk
into the barn myself.

12:32.328 --> 12:32.804

12:32.805 --> 12:34.596
Calmer than I'd be,
but worried.

12:34.597 --> 12:36.140
He just wants
to protect mara.

Thanks for bringing this to us
right away.

Shane doesn't know
vic beat him to a deal.

12:48.187 --> 12:50.989
Yeah, he's got nothing valuable
to give us --

12:50.990 --> 12:52.411
At least, not to trade
for kicking down

12:52.412 --> 12:53.255
his wife's murder charge.

12:53.256 --> 12:56.527

to come in anyway?

to show some respect

13:37.037 --> 13:39.428
to his new business

13:39.429 --> 13:40.371
You only gave him 100 grand.

he's worried sick about his mom.

19:19.908 --> 19:22.635
That's what he learned
from murder number one --

19:22.636 --> 19:24.147
Pretend like
you give a shit!

19:24.148 --> 19:24.913
He's stepping up his game.

19:24.914 --> 19:29.777
You really think he has it in
him to murder his own mother?

19:29.778 --> 19:31.410
That's what he did.

19:30.911 --> 19:31.912
We need to find mom.

19:31.913 --> 19:37.317
You know
that's what I want, too.

19:37.318 --> 19:38.118
I like your mom...a lot.

19:38.119 --> 19:40.554
But the best way
you can help us

19:40.555 --> 19:44.058
is to tell me
everything you rember,

19:44.059 --> 19:45.655
try to retrace her steps.

19:45.656 --> 19:46.532
When did you see her last?

19:46.533 --> 19:48.661
Last night.

19:48.662 --> 19:50.128
Late.

19:50.129 --> 19:53.199
What time?

19:53.200 --> 19:53.942
It was about 3:00 a.m.

19:53.943 --> 19:56.736
She was in the living room,
crying.

19:56.737 --> 19:57.212
It woke me up.

19:57.213 --> 20:03.040
She said that she was upset
about a fight that you guys had.

20:03.041 --> 20:04.684
She said
that she was going out

20:04.685 --> 20:11.693
and that I should
go back to bed.

20:11.694 --> 20:17.934
And then she took her car,
and she never came back.

20:17.935 --> 20:28.667
Any idea...where she might have
gone to that late?

20:28.668 --> 20:29.044
Your house.

20:29.045 --> 20:33.940
She said that she was going
to see you.

20:33.941 --> 20:35.142
Wagenbach:
I did see rita yesterday,

20:35.143 --> 20:36.753
but it wasn't
in the middle of the night.

20:36.754 --> 20:37.577
Steve, give us a minute.

20:37.578 --> 20:38.654
I went over
to see if she was okay.

20:38.655 --> 20:41.123
I got a bunch of hang-ups
from rita's cell yesterday.

20:41.124 --> 20:42.844
I was worried about her.

20:42.845 --> 20:44.116
A- ask danny.

20:44.117 --> 20:44.326
Steve!

20:44.327 --> 20:47.855
Dutch, you've got to tell me
all of it!

20:47.856 --> 20:50.434
After I hit a wall
in the lloyd investigation,

20:50.435 --> 20:51.392
I kept in touch with rita.

20:51.393 --> 20:53.061
I figured,
staying in touch with her,

20:53.062 --> 20:54.461
i'd be able
to keep an eye on lloyd,

20:54.462 --> 20:55.729
prevent him
from hurting anyone else.

20:55.730 --> 20:59.496
Please tell me
you didn't do anything stupid.

20:59.497 --> 20:59.732
No! No.

20:59.733 --> 21:03.036
She kissed me once,
but I-I stopped it there.

21:03.037 --> 21:04.701
The point is,
when lloyd found out about it,

21:04.702 --> 21:05.936
he was pissed --
Enough that

21:05.937 --> 21:06.480
rita was scared.

21:06.481 --> 21:07.582
When I talked to her
yesterday,

21:07.583 --> 21:09.350
she didn't know anything
about those phone calls.

21:09.351 --> 21:14.482
Lloyd made those calls
to get me to come over.

21:14.483 --> 21:20.196
He killed her and --
And he made you a suspect.

21:20.197 --> 21:22.786
[ woman speaking indistinctly
on police radio ]

21:22.787 --> 21:27.461
you haven't
congratulated me yet.

21:27.462 --> 21:29.463
Congratulations.

21:29.464 --> 21:30.340
Do you even know for what?

21:30.341 --> 21:33.563
I graduated the academy
a year ago.

21:33.564 --> 21:34.140
oh.

21:34.141 --> 21:35.003
Congratulations.

21:35.004 --> 21:37.300
That's right.

21:37.301 --> 21:46.746
Means I'm not a rookie anymore.

21:46.747 --> 21:47.247
Guess not.

21:47.248 --> 21:52.323
Maybe someone
will get me a cake.

21:52.324 --> 21:52.500
What?

21:52.501 --> 21:54.851
Sometimes other unis
get you a cake

21:54.852 --> 21:58.591
when you hit
your one-year mark.

21:58.592 --> 22:00.225
Eh, it's not important.

22:00.226 --> 22:02.888
Huggins: if you want more thugs
selling drugs...

22:02.889 --> 22:03.094
no!

22:03.095 --> 22:03.430
no!

22:03.431 --> 22:04.364
no!

22:04.365 --> 22:04.474
no!

22:04.475 --> 22:07.911
...or more hos on the stroll
along streets with potholes,

22:07.912 --> 22:09.978
you do not want robert huggins
as your next mayor,

22:09.979 --> 22:12.081
because I can't do
anything for you.

22:12.082 --> 22:16.518
But if you want your parks
clean and green,

22:16.519 --> 22:19.745
schools with more books
and less crooks,

22:19.746 --> 22:24.883
then vote for me,
and I'll set you free.

22:24.884 --> 22:27.296
Hey, give it up
for the man of god.

22:27.297 --> 22:29.890
What did I say was
gonna -- what did I

22:29.891 --> 22:31.325
say was gonna happen
if we had to respond

22:31.326 --> 22:34.425
to one more noise
complaint at this address?

22:34.426 --> 22:36.129
Keep it down!

22:36.130 --> 22:40.167
Democracy --
Democracy ain't a quiet thing.

22:40.168 --> 22:41.199
Hey! Turn that off!

22:41.200 --> 22:42.836
Turn it off now!

22:42.837 --> 22:44.136
Let me -- let me talk.

22:44.137 --> 22:45.138
Hanlon: quiet!

22:45.139 --> 22:45.381
Quiet!!

22:45.382 --> 22:48.284
I'm not talking about changing
the old ways. No, no.

22:48.285 --> 22:48.876
Changing? That's nothing.

22:48.877 --> 22:52.812
I'm talking about
destroying the old ways.

22:52.813 --> 22:56.678
A political earthquake
where the old paradigm

22:56.679 --> 22:57.743
is eradicated and we -- we...

22:57.744 --> 22:57.949
we!

22:57.950 --> 22:58.285
we!

22:58.286 --> 22:58.951
we!

22:58.952 --> 22:59.061
we!

22:59.062 --> 23:01.355
...we start to build
the new from the nothing.

23:01.356 --> 23:03.500
You're preaching
to the converted.

23:03.501 --> 23:07.425
Right now, I just need for you
to shut this down

23:07.426 --> 23:08.459
and clear the street.

23:08.460 --> 23:11.964
Step into the truth-brary,
officer.

23:11.965 --> 23:14.133
It's right there
in black and white.

23:14.134 --> 23:15.332
It's right there.

23:15.333 --> 23:16.042
You just need to see.

23:16.043 --> 23:18.738
You're under arrest
for failure to disperse,

23:18.739 --> 23:19.348
unlawful assembly.

23:19.349 --> 23:21.573
Turn around, put your hands
behind your back.

23:21.574 --> 23:35.252
Do you want
a resisting charge, too?

23:35.253 --> 23:36.020
Man: william altamore.

23:36.021 --> 23:38.858
Yeah, it's, uh,
it's shane vendrell.

23:38.859 --> 23:39.459
Did they call?

23:39.460 --> 23:41.868
Yes, I spoke
to captain wyms.

23:41.869 --> 23:43.998
What did she say
about mara?

23:43.999 --> 23:46.730
You turn yourself in today,
she'll discuss reduced charges

23:46.731 --> 23:47.230
for your wife.

23:47.231 --> 23:49.702
Reduced charges?

23:49.703 --> 23:50.312
Like manslaughter?

23:50.313 --> 23:53.173
I said no goddamn charges.

23:53.174 --> 23:54.341
I tried.

23:54.342 --> 23:55.085
She wouldn't go there.

23:55.086 --> 23:56.919
There's no deal there
at the moment.

23:56.920 --> 23:59.144
I- I don't know what
to tell you. Maybe you

23:59.145 --> 24:01.745
should think about --
Yeah, okay, okay, thanks.

24:01.746 --> 24:20.598
Thanks.

24:20.599 --> 24:20.841
Mackey.

24:20.842 --> 24:23.203
How you enjoying
your freedom?

24:23.204 --> 24:25.471
Breathing deep.

24:25.472 --> 24:26.139
Breathing easy.

24:26.140 --> 24:26.782
Yeah, not for long.

24:26.783 --> 24:30.020
You're about to get on your
horse and ride to our rescue.

24:30.021 --> 24:32.279
Let me check my schedule,
there, shane.

24:32.280 --> 24:35.424
Oh, sorry,
i'm booked through next weekend.

24:35.425 --> 24:36.992
Do you think I'm joking,
shithead?

24:36.993 --> 24:40.988
I'm in a jam, which means
we're both in a jam.

24:40.989 --> 24:41.555
Not anymore.

24:41.556 --> 24:42.489
I cut those strings, baby.

24:42.490 --> 24:47.060
You and annie oakley
are officially on your own.

24:47.061 --> 24:48.295
Bullshit.

24:48.296 --> 24:50.264
Well, if it were bullshit,
i'd be pulling your ass

24:50.265 --> 24:53.000
out of yet another
vendrell bear trap.

24:53.001 --> 24:55.368
You chew your own
goddamn leg off from now on.

24:55.369 --> 24:57.480
I don't think
you're listening to me.

24:57.481 --> 24:58.281
I need something from you.

24:58.282 --> 24:59.706
And you're not listening
to me, shane.

24:59.707 --> 25:01.485
Ronnie and I
work for i.c.e. Now.

25:01.486 --> 25:03.553
Yeah, I cut the deal
last night --

25:03.554 --> 25:06.680
Full immunity for everything
all of us ever did.

25:06.681 --> 25:08.425
I even used
your little black book

25:08.426 --> 25:10.293
with all our dirty deeds
as a guide.

25:10.294 --> 25:14.652
You forgot a few things.

25:14.653 --> 25:15.721
You know that?

25:15.722 --> 25:16.256
Bullshit.

25:16.257 --> 25:16.723
'fraid not.

25:16.724 --> 25:18.993
Trouble with you --
You're always trying

25:18.994 --> 25:20.226
to be as smart as me.

25:20.227 --> 25:22.228
Now I'm walking away clean,
and you're

25:22.229 --> 25:30.434
the pathetic asshole
headed for

25:30.435 --> 25:31.436
antwon mitchell-ville.

25:31.437 --> 25:33.406
You know,
you always thought

25:33.407 --> 25:36.975
you were
twice the family man I was.

25:36.976 --> 25:37.185
Right?

25:37.186 --> 25:40.822
The great dad, a loving,
misunderstood husband, right?

25:40.823 --> 25:42.825
Your family loves you
so much, vic,

25:42.826 --> 25:44.116
why'd they turn on you,
huh?

25:44.117 --> 25:47.921
corrine's working
with the cops, buddy.

25:47.922 --> 25:50.824
She answered one of our calls
and handed the phone over

25:50.825 --> 25:52.991
to claudette,
who tried to get us to come in,

25:52.992 --> 25:54.194
with you as the big catch.

25:54.195 --> 25:54.670
You know that?

25:54.671 --> 25:59.074
The mother of your children
has been playing you.

25:59.075 --> 26:01.568
She would rather see you
go to prison

26:01.569 --> 26:04.204
than to hug
one of your own kids again.

26:04.205 --> 26:07.038
Whatever happens to me and mara,
at least we'll be together

26:07.039 --> 26:07.906
for it.

26:07.907 --> 26:10.511
Who you got, vic?

26:10.512 --> 26:11.178
Tell me who you got.

26:11.179 --> 26:14.649
When you and queen bitch
are serving your

26:14.650 --> 26:17.550
mandatory life sentences apart,
i'm gonna check in on jackson

26:17.551 --> 26:18.885
and this other kid
once a year

26:18.886 --> 26:19.528
on their birthdays.

26:19.529 --> 26:23.289
I'm gonna tell them
some good old stories

26:23.290 --> 26:24.791
about ma and pa,
muss their hair,

26:24.792 --> 26:26.001
take them out
for an ice cream.

26:26.002 --> 26:28.694
You don't even get to look
at my kids!

26:28.695 --> 26:30.297
Ever!

26:30.298 --> 26:31.107
Do you understand that?!

26:31.108 --> 26:35.628
Yeah, well, I'll send you
a postcard from space mountain.

27:35.589 --> 27:37.959
you don't report
until tomorrow morning.

27:37.960 --> 27:38.569
Where are my kids?

27:38.570 --> 27:40.802
You shipped mine off
without talking to me.

27:40.803 --> 27:42.760
When the beltran bust
went sideways,

27:42.761 --> 27:47.201
we wanted them
out of harm's way.

27:47.202 --> 27:47.434
Good.

27:47.435 --> 27:48.111
When can I see them?

27:48.112 --> 27:53.718
Corrine requested protection
from you, as well.

27:53.719 --> 27:56.454
Corrine's been working
with cops?

27:56.455 --> 28:04.853
Apparently, she's a better judge
of character than I am.

28:04.854 --> 28:07.193
Beltran's still out there.

28:07.194 --> 28:08.522
It's my job to take him down.

28:08.523 --> 28:09.290
You are off beltran.

28:09.291 --> 28:11.702
If I bring him
and the drugs in,

28:11.703 --> 28:27.140
at least let me talk to corrine
so I can see my kids!

28:27.141 --> 28:27.517
i...

28:27.518 --> 28:30.645
I didn't get to say goodbye
to my children.

28:30.646 --> 28:33.114
You said goodbye to them
the moment you shot another cop

28:33.115 --> 28:33.524
in the face.

28:33.525 --> 28:41.165
Be here 9:00 a.m. Sharp
tomorrow.

28:41.166 --> 28:44.299
We're gonna find your mother
sooner or later.

28:44.300 --> 28:46.671
Well, that's why I came
to you people.

28:46.672 --> 28:49.097
No, lloyd, you came here
to implicate me

28:49.098 --> 28:50.472
in her disappearance
because I know what you are.

28:50.473 --> 28:52.477
Hey, my mom is missing,
and you're hassling me?

28:52.478 --> 28:55.870
When you discovered that
your mom had feelings for me,

28:55.871 --> 28:58.172
it scared you, made you mad,
because you knew

28:58.173 --> 28:59.837
i'd be around more,
and, eventually,

28:59.838 --> 29:00.406
i'd expose you.

29:00.407 --> 29:03.277
You are obsessed
with trying to hurt me!

29:03.278 --> 29:04.220
But my mom wouldn't let you.

29:04.221 --> 29:06.480
If anything happens to her,
then you're the one

29:06.481 --> 29:07.615
who's held responsible.

29:07.616 --> 29:09.758
Detective,
I need to speak with you.

29:09.759 --> 29:13.552
Wyms: you are not to talk
to that boy again.

29:13.553 --> 29:14.287
What?

29:14.288 --> 29:14.430
why?

29:14.431 --> 29:18.256
Unis found this in a trash
container outside your house --

29:18.257 --> 29:20.738
Burnt remnants
of women's clothing.

29:20.739 --> 29:23.237
Someone set my trash can on fire
last night.

29:23.238 --> 29:25.299
Neighbors saw you
milling around.

29:25.300 --> 29:28.270
I went outside
to put it out.

29:28.271 --> 29:30.915
Lloyd killed his mom,
put her clothes in my trash can,

29:30.916 --> 29:31.706
and set it on fire.

29:31.707 --> 29:33.673
You can't think
that I had anything to --

29:33.674 --> 29:35.040
Of course not,
but I've got to protect the

29:35.041 --> 29:36.110
integrity of this investigation.

29:36.111 --> 29:38.813
You're not to go back
in that room with lloyd again.

29:38.814 --> 29:40.021
I'm the one
who can break him.

29:40.022 --> 29:48.523
No, steve's taking lead
on this. I'm sorry.

29:48.524 --> 29:49.500
It's time for a new paradigm.

29:49.501 --> 29:51.202
Vote for me, and I'll make sure
that happen for you --

29:51.203 --> 29:55.036
Those of you non-felonious folk
who -- who still can vote.

29:55.037 --> 29:57.597
All right, Mr. Huggins,
you're free to go.

29:57.598 --> 29:59.062
Your homey just posted bail.

29:59.063 --> 30:02.666
All right, now.

30:02.667 --> 30:04.502
Come on.

30:04.503 --> 30:05.440
Let's go.

30:05.441 --> 30:05.616
Okay.

30:05.617 --> 30:07.439
Man: go ahead, brother.

30:07.440 --> 30:07.975
Represent.

30:07.976 --> 30:10.119
Vote for me,
and I will set you free.

30:10.120 --> 30:13.581
Robert huggins --
Remember that.

30:13.582 --> 30:14.091
Robert huggins.

30:14.092 --> 30:18.448
Mr. Huggins, I need
your signature right

30:18.449 --> 30:21.956
here, please.

30:21.957 --> 30:26.593
I'd like to make a formal
request for police protection

30:26.594 --> 30:29.070
as is accorded
to all mayoral candidates,

30:29.071 --> 30:31.633
such as david aceveda
and them other clowns

30:31.634 --> 30:32.410
that don't even matter.

30:32.411 --> 30:33.074
Protection for what?

30:33.075 --> 30:35.999
Threats have been made
against my person.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.338
Yeah, what kind of threats?

30:37.339 --> 30:37.681
All kinds.

30:37.682 --> 30:41.574
I mean, among them, cutting me
from my ass to my appetite --

30:41.575 --> 30:44.709
Not my words,
but that's what they said.

30:44.710 --> 30:45.252
Do you know who?

30:45.253 --> 30:48.146
Anybody who's afraid
of the new paradigm.

30:48.147 --> 30:48.315
hmm.

30:48.316 --> 30:52.085
See, I threaten the
criminal/police codependency

30:52.086 --> 30:56.522
that drives the
prison-industrial complex.

30:56.523 --> 30:57.492
Hmm, do you, now?

30:57.493 --> 30:58.269
Yes, little lady, I do.

30:58.270 --> 31:02.361
I can have one of the detectives
take a report,

31:02.362 --> 31:03.304
but, other than that, I'm...

31:03.305 --> 31:04.630
Don't worry about it.

31:04.631 --> 31:07.467
You know what?

31:07.468 --> 31:09.969
I got something for you.

31:09.970 --> 31:11.100
I'm counting on your vote.

31:11.101 --> 31:11.637
Sure.

31:11.638 --> 31:14.809
Woman:
excuse me, I'm looking for

31:14.810 --> 31:16.307
detective holland wagenbach.

31:16.308 --> 31:16.976
Uh, you found him.

31:16.977 --> 31:22.249
Ellen carmichael,
steve billings' attorney.

31:22.250 --> 31:23.713
The bitch dyke?

31:23.714 --> 31:24.416
I'm sorry?

31:24.417 --> 31:24.826
Uh, nothing.

31:24.827 --> 31:25.893
Steve just described you
differently.

31:25.894 --> 31:27.188
My head's in a case.

31:27.189 --> 31:27.932
What can I do for you?

31:27.933 --> 31:30.534
Well, detective billings
gave me your statement

31:30.535 --> 31:31.669
regarding his injury,
and, frankly,

31:31.670 --> 31:32.368
it isn't very helpful.

31:32.369 --> 31:35.730
You're just now realizing
you're hip-deep in

31:35.731 --> 31:38.066
a hummer lawsuit?

31:38.067 --> 31:38.942
Steve said you were smart.

31:38.943 --> 31:41.967
Flattery isn't gonna change
my perspective on this,

31:41.968 --> 31:43.435
and, uh,
even though it's true,

31:43.436 --> 31:46.405
we both know
steve didn't say that.

31:46.406 --> 31:47.474
Could we talk specifics?

31:47.475 --> 31:48.609
Now's not a good time.

31:48.610 --> 31:50.852
Honestly,
I only need a few minutes.

31:50.853 --> 31:53.955
If you can hang tight,
i'll try to fit you in.

31:53.956 --> 31:58.152
Hey, it's steve's dime,
right?

31:58.153 --> 31:58.662
Thank you, hon.

31:58.663 --> 32:00.329
Excuse me, do you have, uh --
Do you have any roses?

32:00.330 --> 32:03.524
I'm looking for a red one,
if you got it.

32:03.525 --> 32:04.922
That's all we got.

32:04.923 --> 32:14.534
All right, um,
i'll take some pens.

32:14.535 --> 32:19.403
You old enough
to be working here, darlin'?

32:19.404 --> 32:21.242
I'm 16.

32:21.243 --> 32:22.343
Yeah? You look 14.

32:22.344 --> 32:24.509
Well, dirty old man,
I've got the brain

32:24.510 --> 32:27.314
of a 20-year-old.

32:27.315 --> 32:29.946
What you studying?

32:29.947 --> 32:31.582
A.p. Chem.

32:31.583 --> 32:31.916
Ah, good.

32:31.917 --> 32:35.355
You're gonna be
a college girl, huh?

32:35.356 --> 32:36.590
Good for you.

32:36.591 --> 32:41.227
Don't let the wrong guy
get his hooks into you there.

32:41.228 --> 32:47.132
$17.29.

32:47.133 --> 32:47.809
That's way too much.

32:47.810 --> 32:55.510
Yeah, well, if you ever
get your nose out of a book,

32:55.511 --> 32:59.644
you have yourself some fun.

32:59.645 --> 33:07.920
Go to your apartment,
ma'am.

33:07.921 --> 33:11.090
Hit it.

33:11.091 --> 33:14.860
Hyah!

33:14.861 --> 33:16.396
Drop it!

33:16.397 --> 33:17.364
Where's beltran?!

33:17.365 --> 33:17.674
Who? Ugh!

33:17.675 --> 33:21.601
The byz lats were running
errands for pezuela.

33:21.602 --> 33:22.069
Rest in peace.

33:22.070 --> 33:25.040
So don't you tell me
that you didn't pay your

33:25.041 --> 33:27.107
respects to the big boss man!

33:27.108 --> 33:32.474
Okay, I won't tell you.

33:32.475 --> 33:33.777
Ugh! Aah!

33:33.778 --> 33:34.514
Don't!

33:34.515 --> 33:34.758
Oh, no!

33:34.759 --> 33:37.194
He didn't deliver his big
drug shipment to the blacks,

33:37.195 --> 33:41.552
so that means you and your crew
are doing it for him.

33:41.553 --> 33:42.351
Where is he?!

33:42.352 --> 33:42.888
oh!

33:42.889 --> 33:43.496
You'll kill him!

33:43.497 --> 33:44.969
Hope your pet
had his shots.

33:44.970 --> 33:46.958
Stop it! You're gonna kill him!

33:46.959 --> 33:47.234
Stop it!

33:47.235 --> 33:49.497
That's one way to go.

33:49.498 --> 33:50.074
Where's beltran?!

33:50.075 --> 33:54.799
Santi met some mexi big shot
last week

33:54.800 --> 33:56.965
and made me wait in the car.

33:56.966 --> 33:57.805
ohh!

33:57.806 --> 33:58.015
Where?

33:58.016 --> 34:00.508
Old kaplan warehouse
off figueroa.

34:00.509 --> 34:08.815
You want him to live,
you better start sucking face.

34:08.817 --> 34:09.092
Grab it.

34:09.094 --> 34:11.152
Get a couple of unis
down here,

34:11.152 --> 34:18.091
pop this asshole
for dealing kush.

34:18.092 --> 34:19.001
Don't let him near a phone.

34:19.002 --> 34:20.637
I got a 20 on beltran
and the drugs.

34:20.638 --> 34:24.799
You think you can get over
your disgust for me long enough

34:24.800 --> 34:25.632
to take down the cartel?

34:25.634 --> 34:28.202
I am not stupid enough
to chase after another one

34:28.203 --> 34:29.703
of your shadows,
whatever your agenda is.

34:29.704 --> 34:31.039
I told you
i'm gonna deliver this guy.

34:31.040 --> 34:33.107
That's what I'm doing.

34:33.108 --> 34:34.117
You want in on the bust, fine.

34:34.118 --> 34:38.513
If not, I got three other
fed agencies on my speed dial.

34:38.514 --> 34:38.989
Do your thing.

34:38.989 --> 34:41.982
Beltran's grunts are giving him
up to us as we speak.

34:41.983 --> 34:43.971
Be on time
tomorrow morning.

34:48.518 --> 34:50.518
so, as your mayor,

34:50.518 --> 34:51.754
I will make
this neighborhood safer,

34:51.755 --> 34:57.623
because I will add more
police officers to our streets.

34:57.624 --> 35:02.093
Thank you.

35:02.094 --> 35:04.640
Robert huggins,
man of god

35:04.641 --> 35:07.903
and mayoral candidate
for the new paradigm party.

35:07.904 --> 35:10.206
Vote for me,
and I will set you free...

35:10.207 --> 35:12.974
'cause it's time
for a new paradigm, people.

35:12.975 --> 35:14.553
Uh, sir, do you --
Do you have a question?

35:14.554 --> 35:16.688
Don't you think putting
more police on the street

35:16.689 --> 35:22.251
will only make a bad situation
a worse situation?

35:22.252 --> 35:22.661
No, I don't.

35:22.662 --> 35:25.354
The negativity of activity
of a police uniformed army

35:25.355 --> 35:30.423
using intimidation,
deadly force, and whirly-copters

35:30.424 --> 35:32.367
only gives
the criminally inclined

35:32.368 --> 35:37.132
the permission to do
what it is they do.

35:37.133 --> 35:38.935
We have to disagree on that.

35:38.936 --> 35:44.507
But I-I will say this --
That law enforcement can only do

35:44.508 --> 35:46.642
its job in partnership...

35:46.643 --> 35:48.377
With each and every one of you.

35:48.378 --> 35:49.311
We have to work together.

35:49.312 --> 35:51.513
Robert huggins,
new paradigm party.

35:51.514 --> 35:53.615
Vote for me,
and I'll set you free.

35:53.616 --> 35:54.893
He's speaking
of a partnership,

35:54.894 --> 35:58.286
yet, when asked to be included
in tonight's town meeting,

35:58.287 --> 35:58.929
I was included out.

35:58.930 --> 36:00.989
Seems to me you're doing
a pretty good job

36:00.990 --> 36:04.926
of getting
your two cents heard anyway.

36:04.927 --> 36:05.570
Kid's a brick wall.

36:05.571 --> 36:08.030
Every time I drill in on him,
he does an end run,

36:08.031 --> 36:09.866
right back to dutch,
who he seems to have

36:09.867 --> 36:11.575
a very keen understanding of,
by the way.

36:11.576 --> 36:13.778
Do we think there's a chance
the mother's still alive?

36:13.779 --> 36:15.802
She could have gone away
for a spa weekend somewhere,

36:15.803 --> 36:16.604
for all we know.

36:16.605 --> 36:19.607
Rita's dead,
and I'm the reason why.

36:19.608 --> 36:21.019
Just give me
one more shot at him.

36:21.020 --> 36:23.621
With the allegations against you
and the forensic evidence,

36:23.622 --> 36:26.913
any half-wit lawyer could get
this confession thrown out,

36:26.914 --> 36:27.816
and you know it.

36:27.817 --> 36:32.518
Then tell me
how we're gonna get this kid.

36:32.519 --> 36:35.992
How many people
do I have to talk to

36:35.993 --> 36:37.026
before you find my mother?

36:37.027 --> 36:37.602
I'm captain wyms.

36:37.603 --> 36:40.362
All the detectives here
are under my command,

36:40.363 --> 36:42.140
including
detective wagenbach,

36:42.141 --> 36:44.209
who you are saying
is responsible

36:44.210 --> 36:49.468
for your mother's
disappearance?

36:49.469 --> 36:52.508
I want to thank you
for coming forward.

36:52.509 --> 36:55.107
Wagenbach has a history
of getting personally involved

36:55.108 --> 36:55.544
with cases.

36:55.545 --> 37:01.359
So I am taking what
you're saying very seriously.

37:01.360 --> 37:10.426
Do you have any idea
what he did to her?

37:10.427 --> 37:14.094
Some of your mother's clothes
were found in a trash can

37:14.095 --> 37:14.704
outside his house.

37:14.705 --> 37:24.807
They matched the clothing
she was wearing

37:24.808 --> 37:27.473
the last time you saw her.

37:27.474 --> 37:28.016
Did he kill her?

37:28.017 --> 37:30.452
There's no murder
without a body.

37:30.453 --> 37:34.689
I want you to tell me
about the relationship

37:34.690 --> 37:38.087
between your mother
and wagenbach.

37:38.088 --> 37:38.897
That's a great question.

37:38.898 --> 37:41.364
First of all, we need to keep
gang members in the classroom

37:41.365 --> 37:43.392
so that they can get
an education.

37:43.393 --> 37:44.192
Right.

37:44.193 --> 37:44.402
Right.

37:44.403 --> 37:48.104
And then we need to provide
economic opportunities,

37:48.105 --> 37:49.832
jobs, training,
mentor programs.

37:49.833 --> 37:51.033
Let's try this.

37:51.034 --> 37:51.933
Y'all can try this at home.

37:51.934 --> 37:54.670
You got quarters
in your pocket?

37:54.671 --> 37:55.147
Mr. Huggins...

37:55.148 --> 37:57.305
If you want to hear what
the world sounds like

37:57.306 --> 37:58.406
to Mr. Ass-is-veda...

37:58.407 --> 38:00.709
No, don't laugh,
don't laugh.

38:00.710 --> 38:01.219
It's not funny.

38:01.220 --> 38:04.149
If you want to hear what
the world sounds like

38:04.150 --> 38:08.345
to Mr. Ass-is-veda,
it's the sound of money.

38:08.346 --> 38:09.849
It makes you deaf.

38:09.850 --> 38:10.987
Amen.

38:10.988 --> 38:11.497
That's aceveda.

38:11.498 --> 38:13.820
And I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave.

38:13.821 --> 38:16.891
I can't hear you.

38:16.892 --> 38:19.070
See, the prison-industrial
complex

38:19.071 --> 38:23.497
needs us to be gangbangers
and dope dealers,

38:23.498 --> 38:26.068
or it will go broke.

38:26.069 --> 38:26.544
You know that.

38:26.545 --> 38:29.878
Officers, can you, uh, escort
this gentleman out?

38:29.879 --> 38:31.507
I'm going, I'm going.

38:31.508 --> 38:31.983
I'm all right.

38:31.984 --> 38:37.689
But, see, what Mr. Brown bossman
and them don't tell you is,

38:37.690 --> 38:42.250
they're selling our incarcerated
brothers to out-of-state prisons

38:42.251 --> 38:42.818
for a profit.

38:42.819 --> 38:43.828
See, they don't tell you that.

38:43.829 --> 38:44.819
Sound like slavery, don't it?

38:44.820 --> 38:45.429
Take it easy, sir.

38:45.430 --> 38:47.189
Sound like slavery to you?

38:47.190 --> 38:48.065
Take it easy, Mr. Huggins.

38:48.066 --> 38:49.056
Sounds like slavery to me.

38:49.057 --> 38:52.193
Vote for me,
and I will set you free!

38:52.194 --> 38:53.227
Zip it.

38:53.228 --> 38:53.595
Zip it now.

38:53.596 --> 39:02.235
Singers, sing my song,
sing my song, sing my song.

39:02.236 --> 39:04.449
Oh, let the old ways end
so I said...

39:04.450 --> 39:05.774
Steve's under the impression
that you were doing

39:05.775 --> 39:08.610
him a solid by
writing this statement.

39:08.611 --> 39:09.779
He asked me for a favor.

39:09.780 --> 39:10.755
I obliged him with the truth.

39:10.756 --> 39:12.958
Yeah, well, as I read,
it seems pretty clear

39:12.959 --> 39:14.992
you think he was faking
his injury.

39:14.993 --> 39:15.918
Show me where it says that.

39:15.919 --> 39:18.263
All you have to do
is read between the lines.

39:18.264 --> 39:21.566
Listen, I'm very close to making
this city's countersuit

39:21.567 --> 39:22.238
against my guy go away.

39:22.239 --> 39:24.000
But if I turn this over
to the other side,

39:24.001 --> 39:26.768
which I'm obligated to do
under the rules of discovery,

39:26.769 --> 39:28.974
they're gonna drag us
into court.

39:28.975 --> 39:30.762
And this is my problem how?

39:30.763 --> 39:31.130
It's not.

39:31.131 --> 39:33.877
But a jury trial
is nasty and expensive.

39:33.878 --> 39:36.411
Steve could lose his job,
his pension.

39:36.412 --> 39:38.215
He could burn through
his savings.

39:38.216 --> 39:43.378
Now, is that what you really
want to see happen?

39:43.379 --> 39:45.214
Basically,
steve's not a bad guy,

39:45.215 --> 39:49.016
but there is no way I'm
gonna let him fleece the city

39:49.017 --> 39:50.816
over a bump
on the noggin.

39:50.817 --> 39:52.897
I can get him
to drop his claim.

39:52.898 --> 39:57.034
But if the city attorney sees
this turd in sheep's clothing,

39:57.035 --> 40:00.038
they're gonna go after my guy
full speed ahead,

40:00.039 --> 40:06.665
and that's gonna be
on you.

40:06.666 --> 40:08.676
This was
more of a rough draft.

40:08.677 --> 40:10.105
What's the minimum
I have to say

40:10.106 --> 40:19.340
to keep steve
getting a paycheck?

40:19.341 --> 40:21.949
Hey, kim.

40:21.950 --> 40:30.957
hi.

40:30.958 --> 40:35.271
Sewell: "...through the forest
on his horse,

40:35.272 --> 40:45.239
galloping full speed
to save the princess."

40:45.240 --> 40:48.776
"far off in the distance,
he saw the dark tower

40:48.777 --> 40:50.944
rising through the mist."
Jackson:

40:50.945 --> 40:51.621
mommy, are you okay?

40:51.622 --> 40:55.650
I'm fine, baby.

40:55.651 --> 40:56.384
Just listen.

40:56.385 --> 41:02.991
"as the knight got closer,
"he saw the tower was

41:02.992 --> 41:05.761
even taller than he thought.

41:05.762 --> 41:09.833
"it stood like a black fist,
punching through the clouds

41:09.834 --> 41:19.575
and disappearing into the sky."
"he could hear faint sounds

41:19.576 --> 41:23.877
of the princess crying."
Why was she crying?

41:23.878 --> 41:26.146
She was scared.

41:26.147 --> 41:26.423
Of what?

41:26.424 --> 41:30.562
Scared that she would be
trapped there...forever.

41:30.563 --> 41:35.153
Do you think I'm gonna marry
a princess?

41:35.154 --> 41:39.494
You have to listen, honey.

41:39.495 --> 41:40.004
Family meeting!

41:40.005 --> 41:42.674
Captain, one of shane's
neighbors has called 911.

41:42.675 --> 41:43.531
Said she saw him.

41:43.532 --> 41:43.941
Wyms: where?

41:43.942 --> 41:47.933
Walking into his apartment.

41:47.934 --> 41:48.969
Claims he's there inside now.

41:48.970 --> 41:49.868
Aceveda: mackey?

41:49.869 --> 41:50.703
Why are you calling me?

41:50.704 --> 41:53.840
I thought olivia
was your new go-to girl.

41:53.841 --> 41:55.352
She burned me again --
Second time today.

41:55.353 --> 41:56.443
I guess it didn't take i.c.e.

41:56.444 --> 41:58.113
Too long
to figure out that they have

41:58.114 --> 41:58.956
a reptile on the payroll.

41:58.957 --> 42:01.449
Hey, hey, hey, what was that
moist little speech you made

42:01.450 --> 42:03.895
about us respecting
each other's end games?

42:03.896 --> 42:06.521
We both want beltran's people
out of business.

42:06.522 --> 42:10.225
I've got the place,
and the time is right now.

42:10.226 --> 42:10.902
Then do it yourself.

42:10.903 --> 42:14.360
I thought you'd want to be there
for the press conference,

42:14.361 --> 42:15.203
reach out to your voters.

42:15.204 --> 42:18.175
What do you expect me
to do?

42:18.176 --> 42:20.337
Go over olivia's head
to chaffee,

42:20.338 --> 42:22.313
tell him to move
on the intel I gave them,

42:22.314 --> 42:25.137
or lax federal drug enforcement
will be the topic

42:25.138 --> 42:29.641
of your next press conference.

42:29.642 --> 42:30.240
Where are we?

42:30.241 --> 42:31.213
Up there.

42:31.214 --> 42:31.723
Wyms: any sign?

42:31.724 --> 42:32.490
Lowe: we've stayed clear.

42:32.491 --> 42:33.645
No movement in the window.

42:33.646 --> 42:34.780
No sound coming out of there.

42:34.781 --> 42:36.393
Do you want
to call in s.w.a.t.?

42:36.394 --> 42:38.185
No, if the wife and kids
are in there,

42:38.186 --> 42:40.887
it's automatically
a hostage situation.

42:40.888 --> 42:42.623
He doesn't know we're here.

42:42.624 --> 42:42.933
We go in?

42:42.934 --> 42:44.626
He had a chance to shoot me,
and he didn't.

42:44.627 --> 42:47.189
I think
he's gonna go down easy.

42:48.662 --> 42:50.542
We should vest up anyway.

44:13.301 --> 44:13.977
I.c.e. Isn't coming.

44:13.978 --> 44:16.580
Aceveda's been all over chaffee
by now.

44:16.581 --> 44:19.780
No way he will Miss out
on his moment in the sun.

44:19.781 --> 44:22.051
Beltran and his guys
could take off anytime,

44:22.052 --> 44:31.328
and once they're
on the road...

44:31.329 --> 44:35.088
Vic: no way of knowing
who else is inside.

44:35.089 --> 44:35.689
Without backup...

44:35.690 --> 44:45.932
That's some real
cowboy shit, man.

44:45.933 --> 44:46.209
Yee-haw.

All right,
we're gonna have to split up.

45:13.601 --> 45:16.493
You're gonna have to
distract them.

45:16.494 --> 45:18.598
I'm gonna take beltran.

Yeah.

No drugs!

Don't die on me yet,
bitch.

46:30.839 --> 46:31.515
Where are the drugs?

Man: if someone has a shot,
take it.

All right!

47:27.904 --> 47:30.063
The department has finally
agreed to settle.

47:30.064 --> 47:33.501
I knew if I held out
long enough and strong enough,

47:33.502 --> 47:34.344
the bastards would blink.

47:34.345 --> 47:36.947
Oh. I guess congratulations
are in order.

47:36.948 --> 47:38.348
How'd you make out,
steve?

47:38.349 --> 47:40.951
Well, part of the deal is
a confidentiality agreement.

47:40.952 --> 47:42.582
The department can't have
egg on their face.

47:42.583 --> 47:45.112
But let's just say
that I am sittin' pretty.

47:45.113 --> 47:45.555
Good for you.

47:45.556 --> 48:00.859
Sorry if the rest of us
don't feel like celebrating.

Can I have a cup?

48:11.171 --> 48:11.380

48:11.381 --> 48:15.339
Sounds like you got some sort
of payday after all.

48:15.340 --> 48:15.949
How do you figure?

48:15.950 --> 48:20.757
Commission on steve's
settlement, however modest.

48:20.758 --> 48:23.317
Oh, you mean the back pay
for the two days he missed

48:23.318 --> 48:24.517
when he was injured?

48:24.518 --> 48:25.519
That's all he got.

48:25.520 --> 48:29.756
There was
no confidentiality clause.

48:29.757 --> 48:32.790
Did he really call me
a bitch dyke?

48:32.791 --> 48:33.700
In the nicest possible way.

48:33.701 --> 48:35.658
He hit on me once.

48:35.659 --> 48:36.125
I took a pass.

48:36.126 --> 48:42.168
I guess he made
an assumption.

48:42.169 --> 48:42.769
Here's my card.

48:42.770 --> 48:45.806
Call me sometime
if you need anything.

48:45.807 --> 48:46.049
Thanks.

48:46.050 --> 48:50.310
I don't think I'm gonna be suing
the city anytime soon.

48:50.311 --> 48:50.987
Probably not, but...

48:50.988 --> 49:01.989
At least you'll know
how to find me.

49:01.990 --> 49:06.822
Oh, looks like someone's
been working on their game.

49:06.823 --> 49:07.592
Yeah? What game?

49:07.593 --> 49:16.670
See, that's
what I'm talking about.

49:16.671 --> 49:18.170
That's fantastic.

49:18.171 --> 49:19.080
Well done, guys, well done.

49:19.081 --> 49:20.349
Well, let's see,
it all started

49:20.350 --> 49:22.484
when I was approached with
an offer for campaign money.

49:22.485 --> 49:24.886
So, you've been a part
of the actual investigation?

49:24.887 --> 49:27.078
I have been leading it
undercover

49:27.079 --> 49:27.888
for several months, yes.

49:27.889 --> 49:30.458
And you still find time
to run for mayor.

49:30.459 --> 49:33.483
Well, uh, if you want
something done...

49:33.484 --> 49:35.918
Pretty good work today.

49:35.919 --> 49:36.790
Yeah.

49:36.791 --> 49:37.100
You okay?

49:37.101 --> 49:38.525
'cause that went pretty well
in there.

49:38.526 --> 49:40.592
Ronnie, I just
got off the phone with wyms.

49:40.593 --> 49:42.261
She needs you
back at the barn.

49:42.262 --> 49:44.595
The uni here
will give you a lift.

49:44.596 --> 49:45.096
What's up?

49:45.097 --> 49:46.161
Don't know.

49:46.162 --> 49:46.930
Sounded urgent.

49:46.931 --> 49:51.338
All right.

49:51.339 --> 49:55.808
I'll see you later.

49:55.809 --> 49:56.718
Wyms needs to see you, too.

49:56.719 --> 50:00.710
It must have been hard when
dutch came into the picture.

50:00.711 --> 50:04.384
It'd been you and your mom
for so long.

50:04.385 --> 50:06.020
No, what was hard
was when he started

50:06.021 --> 50:08.118
telling her lies about me
so he could have her

50:08.119 --> 50:08.628
all to himself.

50:08.629 --> 50:10.934
Why don't you stop
telling lies, lloyd?

50:10.935 --> 50:12.759
My mom wasn't interested
in him, okay?

50:12.760 --> 50:13.961
But he wouldn't
leave her alone.

50:13.962 --> 50:16.105
I mean, he came over to
the house yesterday to see her.

50:16.106 --> 50:16.804
You can ask the neighbors.

50:16.805 --> 50:22.800
Dutch didn't lay a finger
on your mother.

50:22.801 --> 50:23.543
He burned her clothes.

50:23.544 --> 50:28.469
We've got a witness
that clears him.

50:28.470 --> 50:29.480
who?

50:29.481 --> 50:29.707
me.

50:29.708 --> 50:30.517
I'm a character witness.

50:30.518 --> 50:33.278
I understand that man
better than anyone,

50:33.279 --> 50:34.857
and I know
he didn't do this.

50:34.858 --> 50:37.627
Well, sometimes people
don't know each other

50:37.628 --> 50:38.326
as well as they think.

50:38.327 --> 50:40.328
You mean like your mother
didn't know you?

50:40.329 --> 50:45.258
Didn't know what she'd been
raising the last 16 years?

50:45.259 --> 50:45.835
Well, I know you.

50:45.836 --> 50:48.972
I've been doing this
for 31 years,

50:48.973 --> 50:53.697
and I've interrogated liars
and cheats,

50:53.698 --> 50:54.507
murders and psychopaths.

50:54.508 --> 50:58.101
I've even interviewed
a few innocent people.

50:58.102 --> 51:01.804
And when I listen to you,
I hear an evil,

51:01.805 --> 51:04.942
narcissistic young man
who knows

51:04.943 --> 51:05.652
his mother is dead...

51:05.653 --> 51:14.397
And knows exactly how
her life ended.

51:14.398 --> 51:17.724
It is my responsibility
to inform you

51:17.725 --> 51:22.063
that you are now a suspect
in the disappearance and

51:22.064 --> 51:23.363
possible murder of rita denton.

51:23.364 --> 51:27.001
I can't talk to you anymore,
because you're a minor

51:27.002 --> 51:28.011
and you need a lawyer present.

51:28.012 --> 51:31.037
But we'll get one down here
in the morning.

51:31.038 --> 51:44.613
Until then,
you're a guest of the county.

51:44.614 --> 51:47.421
You were in there
a long time.

51:47.422 --> 51:48.820
You all right?

51:48.821 --> 51:51.558
It's a matter of time.

51:51.559 --> 51:52.793
Before what?

51:52.794 --> 51:53.469
Before lloyd breaks.

51:53.470 --> 51:57.898
If we can just outlast him...

51:57.899 --> 51:58.765
We'll get to the truth.

51:58.766 --> 52:04.336
He loves his mother,
no matter what he did to her.

52:04.337 --> 52:06.640
All sons do.

52:06.641 --> 52:10.143
It's an emotional killing,
but, eventually, everything

52:10.144 --> 52:10.919
will come spilling out.

52:10.920 --> 52:15.482
There's nobody better at this
than you.

52:15.483 --> 52:15.892
Not even me.

52:15.893 --> 52:17.816
Where are those new meds?

52:17.817 --> 52:18.883
Let me get them for you.

52:18.884 --> 52:21.649
In here?

52:21.650 --> 52:23.086
Dutch.

52:23.087 --> 52:25.959
Uh...

52:25.960 --> 52:27.957
There are no new meds.

52:27.958 --> 52:29.893
They don't work anymore.

52:29.894 --> 52:30.403
Tried them all.

52:30.404 --> 52:32.396
And the side effects
were affecting my job

52:32.397 --> 52:33.040
performance anyway.

52:33.041 --> 52:36.076
Well, they must be able
to give you something.

52:36.077 --> 52:38.310
They've got all kinds
of new dru--

52:38.311 --> 52:40.906
I'm dying.

52:40.907 --> 52:46.478
This is what it looks like.

52:46.479 --> 52:48.715
It's...

52:48.716 --> 52:54.084
It's slow, but it's moving
in one direction.

52:54.085 --> 52:56.621
Okay, l-let's not go there.

52:56.622 --> 52:58.755
Well, no, not today.

52:58.756 --> 52:59.565
But sooner than later...

52:59.566 --> 53:02.438
This is the disease
that's gonna kill me.

53:02.439 --> 53:05.374
This is...an emotional backlash
to shane.

53:05.375 --> 53:08.502
The world's just screwed up
today.

53:08.503 --> 53:09.145
All I have to do...

53:09.146 --> 53:12.782
Is deal with this pain
every day.

53:12.783 --> 53:21.377
And every day that I can,
i'll show up...

53:21.378 --> 53:22.287
Until the day that I don't.

53:22.288 --> 53:24.517
What can I do?

53:24.518 --> 53:24.794
Tell me.

53:24.795 --> 53:30.417
You just keep doing
what friends do.

53:30.418 --> 53:33.598
It means a lot.

53:46.436 --> 53:47.035
Watch the curb.

53:47.036 --> 53:49.471
Two gunshot wounds --
One to the chest,

53:49.472 --> 53:50.774
one to the abdomen.

53:50.775 --> 53:51.508
He's touch-and-go.

53:51.509 --> 53:55.176
I'll ride with him,
see if I can get a statement.

53:55.177 --> 53:55.519
Good luck.

53:55.520 --> 53:58.878
Lowe: hey, get these
people back.

53:58.879 --> 54:00.181
Set up a perimeter.

54:00.182 --> 54:02.583
Step back, sir.

54:02.584 --> 54:03.886
One, two, three.

54:03.887 --> 54:08.025
Robert, who did this?

54:08.026 --> 54:09.420
Big -- big staxx.

54:09.421 --> 54:11.060
Big staxx. Acorn park.

54:11.061 --> 54:11.204
why?

54:11.205 --> 54:14.698
I organized a picket line
around his rock house.

54:14.699 --> 54:18.366
Crackheads
didn't want to cross.

54:18.367 --> 54:18.909
Crackheads? Wow.

54:18.910 --> 54:20.569
That's big-time, robert.

54:20.570 --> 54:20.946
That's big.

54:20.947 --> 54:21.313
New paradigm.

54:21.314 --> 54:24.105
New paradigm.

54:24.106 --> 54:26.142
Yeah.

54:26.143 --> 54:29.007
ohh!

54:29.008 --> 54:30.513
I got your vote?

54:30.514 --> 54:31.143
Yeah.

54:31.144 --> 54:33.147
I got your --
Yeah, robert.

54:33.148 --> 54:33.490
Look. See?

54:33.491 --> 54:36.819
You see? You see that?

54:36.820 --> 54:46.095
You got my vote, robert.

54:46.096 --> 55:23.296
Get the paddles.

55:23.297 --> 55:25.469
Ronnie.

55:25.470 --> 55:28.034
hey.

55:28.035 --> 55:31.203
I got to talk to you, man.

55:31.204 --> 55:33.742
So you heard...

55:33.743 --> 55:38.281
About shane?

55:38.282 --> 55:41.983
No. What?

55:41.984 --> 55:44.950
He killed himself.

55:44.951 --> 55:47.320
What?

55:47.321 --> 55:47.821
At his place.

55:47.822 --> 55:56.128
Gun to his head
when the cops came in.

55:56.129 --> 55:59.166
Oh, jesus christ.

55:59.167 --> 55:59.543
And, vic...

55:59.544 --> 56:11.711
He took jackson and mara
with him.

56:11.712 --> 56:12.211
I don't know.

56:12.212 --> 56:22.389
The whole thing
is just so shitty.

56:22.390 --> 56:24.957
At least we're clear now.

56:24.958 --> 56:27.570
Finally clear
of all the shit

56:27.571 --> 56:31.040
that they were holding
over our heads.

56:31.041 --> 56:33.008
I never thought
we would be.

56:33.009 --> 56:35.503
We don't even need
i.c.e.'s immunity now.

56:35.504 --> 56:36.347
Ronnie --
Vic, I need to ask

56:36.348 --> 56:58.757
some questions about
the vendrell case.

56:58.758 --> 57:03.362
Could we switch seats,
please?

57:03.363 --> 57:03.705
Excuse me?

57:03.706 --> 57:27.524
This ismyseat.

57:27.525 --> 57:28.557
That's yours.

57:28.558 --> 57:31.161
You heard about shane,
what he did

57:31.162 --> 57:48.478
to his pregnant wife,
to his young son.

57:48.479 --> 57:49.021
He wrote a note.

57:49.022 --> 57:55.051
"i guess enough painkillers
can make even the worst kind

57:55.052 --> 57:55.628
"of hurt go away.

57:55.629 --> 58:01.124
"the thing you need to know
is that mara was innocent,

58:01.125 --> 58:02.025
"and jackson was innocent.

58:02.026 --> 58:05.104
"they didn't know
what they were drinking,

58:05.105 --> 58:08.498
"and their last moments together
were happy ones.

58:08.499 --> 58:14.137
"they left the way
I first found them --

58:14.138 --> 58:14.904
"perfect and innocent.

58:14.905 --> 58:18.718
"they were innocent,
and they're in heaven now,

58:18.719 --> 58:22.211
"and we'll always be
a family.

58:22.212 --> 58:25.848
"the guilty ones
are me and vic.

58:25.849 --> 58:30.564
"vic led,
but I kept following.

58:30.565 --> 58:33.799
"i don't think one's worse
than the other,

58:33.800 --> 58:37.526
"but we made each other
into something worse

58:37.527 --> 58:43.433
"than our
individual selves.

58:43.434 --> 58:45.035
"i wish I'd never met him.

58:45.036 --> 58:45.645
"i see it all now.

58:45.646 --> 58:47.746
"there's no apologies
I can make,

58:47.747 --> 58:50.316
"no explanations
I can give.

58:50.317 --> 59:00.883
"i was who I was, and I can't be
that person anymore.

59:00.884 --> 59:03.152
I can't let myself..."
We think this is

59:03.153 --> 59:13.096
where he was
when we came in,

59:13.097 --> 59:15.799
because it stops there.

59:15.800 --> 59:16.409
All those busts...

59:16.410 --> 59:23.172
All those confessions
you got in this room,

59:23.173 --> 59:27.043
illegal or otherwise,
all the drugs you got off

59:27.044 --> 59:28.020
the street tonight for i.c.e.

59:28.021 --> 59:36.028
You must be very proud
of yourself.

59:36.029 --> 01:01:47.280
This is what the "hero" left
on his way out the door.

01:01:47.281 --> 01:01:48.116
Dutch.

01:01:48.117 --> 01:01:49.318
You can bill me for it.

01:01:49.319 --> 01:01:56.423
Fine.

01:01:56.424 --> 01:02:03.499
First payment's due now.

01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:03.742
Ronnie!

01:02:03.743 --> 01:02:11.440
Ronald everett gardocki,
you're under arrest.

01:02:11.441 --> 01:02:13.375
For what?

01:02:13.376 --> 01:02:15.577
The last three years,
the armenian

01:02:15.578 --> 01:02:18.581
money train robbery,
covering up

01:02:18.582 --> 01:02:19.358
terry crowley's murder.

01:02:19.359 --> 01:02:21.927
Mackey gave the feds
everything.

01:02:21.928 --> 01:02:28.586
Already got himself
full immunity.

01:02:28.587 --> 01:02:35.595
Not you, though.

01:02:35.596 --> 01:02:39.399
What?

01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:40.902
You told themallof it?

01:02:40.903 --> 01:02:41.146
Ronnie.

01:02:41.147 --> 01:02:42.581
You made a deal
for yourself

01:02:42.582 --> 01:02:43.949
and you're sendingme
to prison?

01:02:43.950 --> 01:02:48.110
I'm -- I'm sorry. My family --
I- I thought corrine --

01:02:48.111 --> 01:02:48.920
You're goddamned sorry?!

01:02:48.921 --> 01:02:49.878
Wagenbach: process him.

01:02:49.879 --> 01:02:50.345
Take him in.

01:02:50.346 --> 01:02:52.281
I didn't think
I had a choice.

01:02:52.282 --> 01:02:54.793
What about
my goddamn choice?!

01:02:54.794 --> 01:02:57.553
Where was my goddamn choice?!

01:02:57.554 --> 01:02:58.197
I was going to run!

01:02:58.198 --> 01:03:02.158
We were gonna run together!

01:03:02.159 --> 01:03:02.558
God damn it!

01:03:02.559 --> 01:03:03.268
What about the team?!

01:03:03.269 --> 01:03:13.502
What about protecting
the goddamn team?!

01:03:13.503 --> 01:03:14.812
You can go now.

01:03:33.675 --> 01:03:34.310
Where are my kids?

01:03:34.311 --> 01:03:37.747
Commencement paperwork
will be ready for you to sign

01:03:37.748 --> 01:03:38.680
by the end of the day.

01:03:38.681 --> 01:03:39.290
Where's my family?

01:03:39.291 --> 01:03:41.124
As soon as they're situated
in their new location,

01:03:41.125 --> 01:03:42.895
i'll let you know
they're safe.

01:03:42.896 --> 01:03:46.188
Tapped into an old c.i.

01:03:46.189 --> 01:03:46.832
Of mine last night.

01:03:46.833 --> 01:03:50.836
I got some reliable intel
about a vietnamese crew

01:03:50.837 --> 01:03:52.734
trying to make a move
on the tweeny trade.

01:03:52.735 --> 01:03:54.126
You won't be needing
your c.i.s.

01:03:54.127 --> 01:03:55.674
Won't be needing
a weapon, either.

01:03:55.675 --> 01:03:58.501
You get it out of this building,
or you put it in a lockbox.

01:03:58.502 --> 01:03:59.632
This is my personal.

01:03:59.633 --> 01:04:02.735
I assumed you'd be issuing --
You don't get it.

01:04:02.736 --> 01:04:04.707
You're not on the street for us.

01:04:04.708 --> 01:04:05.250
Where am I then?

01:04:05.251 --> 01:04:08.010
These are summaries of recent
gang-related activity

01:04:08.011 --> 01:04:10.946
in the greater
los angeles area.

01:04:10.947 --> 01:04:11.089
tom?

01:04:11.090 --> 01:04:13.525
We need you to review these,
look for patterns,

01:04:13.526 --> 01:04:16.094
and offer analysis
by way of memo,

01:04:16.095 --> 01:04:17.829
at least 10 pages,
single-spaced.

01:04:17.830 --> 01:04:24.056
I'll need the first report
by 6:00 tonight.

01:04:24.057 --> 01:04:26.458
This is not
what I signed up for.

01:04:26.459 --> 01:04:26.801
Me either.

01:04:26.802 --> 01:04:28.096
I don't do desks!

01:04:28.097 --> 01:04:28.273
Fine.

01:04:28.274 --> 01:04:29.541
Then you violated
your agreement,

01:04:29.542 --> 01:04:32.334
and you'll be prosecuted
for everything you confessed to.

01:04:32.335 --> 01:04:34.876
Read the terms
of your immunity deal.

01:04:34.877 --> 01:04:36.745
Mandatory drug tests
once a week,

01:04:36.746 --> 01:04:39.673
five written reports
a week.

01:04:39.674 --> 01:04:41.551
Unfortunately,
it's only for three years,

01:04:41.552 --> 01:04:50.382
but I'm gonna see you feel
everysingle day of it.

01:04:50.383 --> 01:04:54.830
Let me talk to corrine.

01:04:54.831 --> 01:04:59.824
You can't --
I got to see my kids.

01:04:59.825 --> 01:05:00.826
It's suit-and-tie here.

01:05:00.827 --> 01:05:10.515
Lunch hour,
go home and change.

01:05:10.516 --> 01:05:13.585
These rumors circulating
that I had anything to do

01:05:13.586 --> 01:05:16.544
with this crackpot
candidate's death --

01:05:16.545 --> 01:05:17.188
That's how it goes.

01:05:17.189 --> 01:05:19.921
You know, in the hood, rumors
take on a life of their own.

01:05:19.922 --> 01:05:22.193
But I cannot ignore
a bomb threat

01:05:22.194 --> 01:05:25.421
to your campaign headquarters
no matter how far-fetched.

01:05:25.422 --> 01:05:27.766
The worst part is
this huggins fellow

01:05:27.767 --> 01:05:28.691
apparently saw it coming.

01:05:28.692 --> 01:05:34.560
He asked tina for
police protection yesterday

01:05:34.561 --> 01:05:35.831
before he got shot.

01:05:35.832 --> 01:05:36.475
How you holding up?

01:05:36.476 --> 01:05:39.801
Got complaints.

01:05:39.802 --> 01:05:40.644
There's no need to share.

01:05:40.645 --> 01:05:43.447
Wouldn't have anything to do
with the man who got away?

01:05:43.448 --> 01:05:47.711
You know, webothspent a lot
of time and energy

01:05:47.712 --> 01:05:52.613
in this room
trying to put that man away.

01:05:52.614 --> 01:05:55.850
I caught
your press conference.

01:05:55.851 --> 01:05:57.753
Congratulations.

01:05:57.754 --> 01:05:58.630
You're gonna be the mayor.

01:05:58.631 --> 01:06:01.790
Well, there's the little matter
of the election.

01:06:01.791 --> 01:06:13.899
I'm sure
that won't stop you.

01:06:13.900 --> 01:06:14.768
This is the kitchen.

01:06:14.769 --> 01:06:17.238
We ask people
who bring in their lunches

01:06:17.239 --> 01:06:22.574
to label them
so there will be no confusion.

01:06:22.575 --> 01:06:24.288
The lights
and air-conditioning

01:06:24.289 --> 01:06:27.121
will shut off automatically
at 6:00 p.m. --

01:06:27.122 --> 01:06:28.949
Unless you call
extension 863

01:06:28.950 --> 01:06:31.396
and let them know
that you're working late.

01:06:31.397 --> 01:06:34.399
Under no circumstances should
you adjust the thermostat.

01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:36.859
If you want to change
the temperature,

01:06:36.860 --> 01:06:38.236
it really
has to be authorized

01:06:38.237 --> 01:06:43.664
by a maintenance
supervisor.

01:06:43.665 --> 01:06:44.866
Here we are.

01:06:44.867 --> 01:06:47.634
If you need anything,
you can always reach me

01:06:47.635 --> 01:06:50.081
in human resources,
extension 912.

01:06:50.082 --> 01:06:58.312
I'm gonna leave your key card
on the desk.

01:06:58.313 --> 01:07:01.116
Okay. Here.

01:07:01.117 --> 01:07:03.651
I'll get that for you.

01:07:03.652 --> 01:07:04.494
Isn't particularly, um...

01:07:04.495 --> 01:07:06.420
And inside, it's just
not a whole lot better.

01:07:06.421 --> 01:07:08.255
It's pretty basic,
but, well, it's quiet,

01:07:08.256 --> 01:07:09.800
and the schools
are getting better.

01:07:09.801 --> 01:07:11.469
The district grades out
pretty well,

01:07:11.470 --> 01:07:14.637
particularly the programs
for autistic children.

01:07:14.638 --> 01:07:17.231
There's an ice rink
a couple miles away.

01:07:17.232 --> 01:07:17.741
And guess what?

01:07:17.742 --> 01:07:22.180
There is a museum here
with an actual dinosaur.

01:07:22.181 --> 01:07:26.217
Hmm? The largest and finest
juvenile t-rex in the world

01:07:26.218 --> 01:07:29.410
is right here at the fabulous
burpee museum.

01:07:29.411 --> 01:07:30.045
Her name is jane.

01:07:30.046 --> 01:07:34.249
There's parks nearby,
the shopping, mostly on the --

01:07:34.250 --> 01:07:42.089
Stop. Stop.

01:07:42.090 --> 01:07:43.191
It's, um -- it's perfect.

01:07:43.192 --> 01:07:46.291
Have you, uh,
thought about the nickname

01:07:46.292 --> 01:07:48.729
you'd like us to call you?

01:07:48.730 --> 01:07:49.361
Your legacy?

01:07:49.362 --> 01:07:51.499
Detective --
Without one,

01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:52.376
it's easy to be forgotten.

01:07:52.377 --> 01:07:57.038
You ever heard the name
mack ray edwards?

01:07:57.039 --> 01:07:57.182
see?

01:07:57.183 --> 01:07:59.773
Edwards worked for the county,
helped build

01:07:59.774 --> 01:08:01.642
the los angeles freeways.

01:08:01.643 --> 01:08:03.612
From 1953 to 1969,
he slaughtered children

01:08:03.613 --> 01:08:05.781
at night,
planted their bodies in the soil

01:08:05.782 --> 01:08:09.151
that he and his fellow workers
would pave over with asphalt

01:08:09.152 --> 01:08:09.594
the next day.

01:08:09.595 --> 01:08:12.619
The city's roads were literally
paved with dead bodies.

01:08:12.620 --> 01:08:14.766
50% of the world's
known serial killers

01:08:14.767 --> 01:08:18.593
have spent at least a portion
of their lives

01:08:18.594 --> 01:08:24.165
in southern california.

01:08:24.166 --> 01:08:24.942
Why doyouthink that is?

01:08:24.943 --> 01:08:29.670
Well, it's 'cause everyone
comes to los angeles

01:08:29.671 --> 01:08:30.538
to get famous.

01:08:30.540 --> 01:08:38.212
Get ready
for your close-up, lloyd.

01:08:38.212 --> 01:08:41.823
[ laughter,
indistinct conversations ]

01:08:41.823 --> 01:08:48.522
out of the academy
for one year.

01:08:48.523 --> 01:08:50.888
I made it.

01:08:50.889 --> 01:08:52.124
I made it.

01:08:52.125 --> 01:08:53.192
Good job.

01:08:53.193 --> 01:08:54.390
2-11 in progress.

01:08:54.390 --> 01:08:55.327
Shots have been fired.

01:08:55.328 --> 01:08:56.636
Come on --
Broadway and lennox.

01:08:56.638 --> 01:09:02.634
Downtown officers
need help.
