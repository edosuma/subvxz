WEBVTT

00:32.840 --> 00:35.040
So embarrassing.
"Cowie's a cock."

01:02.720 --> 01:04.280
Damn.

01:13.560 --> 01:16.000
Oliver.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.760
I was, um -- I was just waiting
for you to finish.

01:18.760 --> 01:21.200
Yeah, I'm going home.

01:21.200 --> 01:24.680
Thing is, um, James
just called me.

01:26.400 --> 01:28.480
He's livid, obviously.

01:28.480 --> 01:30.600
Tried to make out
you'd put me up to it.

01:30.600 --> 01:32.400
Well, it's his own fault.

01:32.400 --> 01:35.400
Didn't need to go this far.

01:35.400 --> 01:37.480
Well, he's on his way back
from Brussels, anyway.

01:37.480 --> 01:40.000
Oh, good.
Tomorrow'll be fun.

01:41.680 --> 01:42.760
Oliver, about what happened --

01:42.760 --> 01:45.120
Don't worry about it, Saskia.

02:10.600 --> 02:12.520
- I'm staying at Petal's tonight.
- Okay.

02:12.520 --> 02:13.720
Mum's at yoga,
said it was fine.

02:13.720 --> 02:15.040
Have you eaten?

02:28.720 --> 02:31.400
Right.
I'm off.

02:31.400 --> 02:33.200
Have you finished, Flo?

02:33.200 --> 02:35.360
Uh, yeah. No.

02:35.360 --> 02:38.200
Just taking a break.

02:38.200 --> 02:39.760
Bye, Dad.

02:47.080 --> 02:50.120
- You should be studying.
- Why?

02:50.120 --> 02:53.400
I don't care if I get
into school in Japan, anyway.

02:53.400 --> 02:56.880
Yeah, but if you do well at ISC,
we've got, like,

02:56.880 --> 02:58.920
some bargaining power
for you staying with us

02:58.920 --> 03:00.360
My dad's already said no
to that.

03:00.360 --> 03:04.200
I'm just like a wheelie case.

03:04.200 --> 03:06.760
Wherever his next job is.

03:06.760 --> 03:09.000
I hate him, Petal.

03:11.520 --> 03:12.840
Hey.

03:14.480 --> 03:17.760
We just got to get through
this next year.

03:17.760 --> 03:19.280
Then you can come back.

03:21.040 --> 03:22.920
We'll get a flat together.

03:38.280 --> 03:40.440
Hey.

03:40.440 --> 03:41.960
What you up to?

06:27.760 --> 06:30.360
Stay where you.
I'll get someone right to you.

06:58.200 --> 07:00.960
Ahoy there.
Anyone in?

07:02.400 --> 07:03.720
Oh.

07:06.600 --> 07:09.240
I told you I'd come
and pick them up.

07:09.240 --> 07:11.640
I had
a breakfast meeting nearby.

07:11.640 --> 07:13.400
Just as well.

07:13.400 --> 07:15.840
You're not getting your hands
on this little beauty.

07:18.880 --> 07:23.720
Why don't you just, uh,
set up a forwarding address?

07:23.720 --> 07:26.640
I did.
For important things.

07:26.640 --> 07:28.680
Um, can I get you
something, or...

07:28.680 --> 07:29.680
No.

07:29.680 --> 07:31.400
Um...

07:33.760 --> 07:35.840
What is it you're doing here,
Max?

07:35.840 --> 07:39.400
Sorry, I thought you were there
when you asked me to move out.

07:39.400 --> 07:42.440
You're living like a student,
camped out on this dinghy.

07:42.440 --> 07:43.880
Even the pot plant
I gave you died.

07:43.880 --> 07:45.520
It just needs a water.

07:45.520 --> 07:47.680
Why don't you just find
a proper address,

07:47.680 --> 07:49.240
make a home for yourself, Max?

07:49.240 --> 07:52.000
Right, well,
thanks for dropping by.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.480
You'll be wanting to get to
your breakfast date, I imagine.

07:55.480 --> 07:58.400
And next time, call first.

07:58.400 --> 08:00.680
You know I-I might be
with someone or...

08:00.680 --> 08:02.520
If you're going to
be like that...

08:03.520 --> 08:05.600
Forget it.

08:14.040 --> 08:15.720
D.I. Arnold.

08:17.400 --> 08:19.560
Mm-hmm.
Address?

08:39.840 --> 08:42.000
- Thank you.
- Morning.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.600
- Morning.
- Oliver Cowie.

08:44.600 --> 08:48.120
Head of humanities at the
International School of Chelsea.

08:48.120 --> 08:50.840
His wife, Lyn, called it in
about an hour ago.

08:50.840 --> 08:52.760
She found him when
she got up this morning.

08:52.760 --> 08:55.200
She didn't hear a thing.

08:55.200 --> 08:57.040
There's no sign
of a break-in yet.

09:18.840 --> 09:20.960
We just need a picture.
We've got those.

09:26.720 --> 09:28.720
Anything you can tell us,
Ashley?

09:28.720 --> 09:32.200
Probable cause of death --
massive head injury

09:32.200 --> 09:36.240
following blunt trauma
from multiple blows to the head.

09:36.240 --> 09:38.080
Weapon?

09:38.080 --> 09:39.360
Take your pick.

09:41.400 --> 09:44.360
Yeah, except it wasn't
any of them.

09:44.360 --> 09:45.960
Whatever caused these wounds

09:45.960 --> 09:50.280
would probably
have a square edge

09:50.280 --> 09:52.000
and be heavily bloodstained.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.400
And unlikely to be hung back
on the wall afterwards.

09:54.400 --> 09:55.680
Mm.

09:55.680 --> 09:59.120
From temperature
and rigor mortis,

09:59.120 --> 10:00.880
I'd estimate
time of death

10:00.880 --> 10:03.360
somewhere between
9:00 p.m. and midnight.

10:16.240 --> 10:21.080
I -- I got home about 11:00.

10:21.080 --> 10:23.200
Flo was staying with a friend.

10:23.200 --> 10:26.200
Oliver was in his study.

10:26.200 --> 10:28.400
I didn't want to disturb him.

10:28.400 --> 10:33.480
I knew he was up to his eyes,
so I just...

10:33.480 --> 10:38.480
I went to bed.

10:41.200 --> 10:43.040
Was he already dead?

10:43.040 --> 10:46.400
We can't say for sure yet.

10:46.400 --> 10:49.080
But we need to know if there
was anything unusual.

10:55.520 --> 10:57.920
Everything, I mean.

10:57.920 --> 10:59.880
There was just so much
to do before the move

10:59.880 --> 11:02.160
Tokyo.

11:02.160 --> 11:04.400
As soon as the school year
was over.

11:04.400 --> 11:08.680
Visas, packing, rentals.

11:08.680 --> 11:12.520
There was no sign
of forced entry, Mrs. Cowie.

11:12.520 --> 11:16.600
It looks like your husband
let his attacker in.

11:16.600 --> 11:20.120
Is there anyone you can think
of who may have had

11:20.120 --> 11:22.640
an argument with him
or held a grudge?

11:22.640 --> 11:24.680
Oliver didn't make enemies.

11:27.280 --> 11:30.640
I'm going to need
the clothes.

11:34.720 --> 11:36.600
I work here.
I'm their cleaner.

11:36.600 --> 11:38.160
- They'll be expecting me!
- No, no, no.

11:38.160 --> 11:39.880
You can't come in.
There's a crime scene.

11:39.880 --> 11:41.400
Okay.
You can't come in.

11:41.400 --> 11:43.240
Sorry, boss.
She says she's the cleaner.

11:43.240 --> 11:45.520
You need to stay
behind the cordon, madam.

11:45.520 --> 11:47.040
This is a crime scene.

11:50.520 --> 11:52.560
Carmel!

11:52.560 --> 11:53.840
Lyn!

11:53.840 --> 11:55.200
Let's get you back in the house.

11:55.200 --> 11:56.240
Sweet Jesus.

11:56.240 --> 12:00.280
Let's go back inside.

12:00.280 --> 12:02.000
All right, come with me.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.400
- What happened?
- I'll explain.

12:03.400 --> 12:04.600
- I'll explain it to you.
- You need to tell me.

12:06.640 --> 12:08.000
First instincts?

12:08.000 --> 12:10.480
An angry attack, personal.

12:10.480 --> 12:13.280
Spouse seems the most likely
place to start.

12:13.280 --> 12:15.720
Well, she seems
shattered enough.

12:15.720 --> 12:17.760
- But she would be, wouldn't she?
- I'd say so.

12:17.760 --> 12:18.960
Morning, boss.

12:18.960 --> 12:21.400
I've got a neighbor across
the road

12:21.400 --> 12:22.920
said he saw a push-bike
leaning on the wall here

12:22.920 --> 12:24.720
last night around 9:00.

12:24.720 --> 12:27.240
It wasn't chained up, and he
thought it might get stolen.

12:27.240 --> 12:28.760
What kind of bike?
Any details?

12:28.760 --> 12:31.920
Just a bicycle.
No basket or defining color.

12:35.640 --> 12:38.400
Flo?
I'm Detective Shamsie.

12:38.400 --> 12:41.000
- What's going on?
- Can you come with me, please?

12:47.200 --> 12:50.720
Miss Fry cleans alternate days,
9:00 till 4:00.

12:50.720 --> 12:52.000
Depending on requirements.

12:53.280 --> 12:54.560
She was off yesterday.

12:58.840 --> 13:02.640
You've worked for the Cowies
for four years, Miss Fry?

13:02.640 --> 13:04.960
Since they moved back
from Canberra.

13:04.960 --> 13:08.000
Have you noticed
anything unusual recently?

13:08.000 --> 13:11.200
They're a wonderful family.

13:11.200 --> 13:14.200
Devoted to each other.

13:14.200 --> 13:17.480
I was
gonna miss them terribly.

13:17.480 --> 13:20.280
Mrs. Cowie mentioned the move.

13:20.280 --> 13:23.200
Pretty stressful
for any family.

13:23.200 --> 13:26.760
I mean, Flo didn't want to go
to Japan, obviously,

13:26.760 --> 13:29.440
being the age she is.

13:29.440 --> 13:31.800
Lyn and Oliver had their hands
full in that respect.

13:31.800 --> 13:34.000
What do you mean?

13:34.000 --> 13:38.200
Oh, you know, just playing up
at school and whatnot.

13:38.200 --> 13:39.920
Bless her.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.040
I mean, now what's
she gonna do?

13:44.240 --> 13:46.720
Um, "alternate days."

13:46.720 --> 13:48.600
So that's, what,
three days a week?

13:48.600 --> 13:50.240
More if they need.

13:50.240 --> 13:51.760
I cook as well
when they're busy.

13:51.760 --> 13:54.440
And I used to sit for Flo
when she was younger.

13:56.400 --> 14:00.640
I suppose Mr. Cowie didn't
like you in his office.

14:00.640 --> 14:04.400
Only, the mantel's
a little dusty.

14:04.400 --> 14:07.720
It's all this shifting things
around, preparing for the move.

14:10.400 --> 14:12.720
So, you'd notice if anything
were missing?

14:29.520 --> 14:31.840
A trophy.

14:31.840 --> 14:35.400
Cowie coached the debating team
at his old school in Australia.

14:35.400 --> 14:38.080
The cleaner said it was there
the day before yesterday.

14:38.080 --> 14:41.360
Of all the weapons in the room,
why'd the killer choose that?

14:41.360 --> 14:44.040
I doubt they "chose" anything.

14:44.040 --> 14:46.200
Just went
for what was nearest.

14:46.200 --> 14:50.760
So, what --
Impulse, red mist, rage,

14:50.760 --> 14:53.000
or fear?

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
There's something not right
about Lyn.

14:55.000 --> 14:58.120
She's out late, goes to bed

14:58.120 --> 15:00.240
without even checking in
on her husband,

15:00.240 --> 15:02.720
and doesn't notice, or care,
that he hasn't come to bed.

15:02.720 --> 15:04.400
Or hopes he won't.

15:04.400 --> 15:07.200
Either way, I agree,
it doesn't look good.

15:07.200 --> 15:11.280
Well, let's get everything
we can

15:11.280 --> 15:16.400
from their situation
before last night.

15:16.400 --> 15:20.200
Well, according to the cleaner,
they were the perfect couple.

15:20.200 --> 15:23.520
Huh!
There's no such thing.

15:32.520 --> 15:35.400
Would you say I live
like a student?

15:35.400 --> 15:36.880
Pardon?

15:36.880 --> 15:38.480
Something Astrid said.

15:38.480 --> 15:40.120
Harsh.

15:40.120 --> 15:43.960
Actually, I think she was
trying to be kind.

15:43.960 --> 15:46.400
Which makes it even worse.

15:55.360 --> 15:56.960
Impressive building,
innit?

15:56.960 --> 15:59.200
Mm.

16:06.720 --> 16:08.080
Thank you.

16:10.240 --> 16:11.880
- Hello.
- I'm D.I. Arnold.

16:11.880 --> 16:13.480
This is D.S. Shamsie.

16:13.480 --> 16:15.440
We have an appointment
with Mr. James Green.

16:15.440 --> 16:17.040
If you'd like to follow me, please.

16:36.480 --> 16:39.400
I'm only just back from
a conference in Brussels,

16:39.400 --> 16:42.200
so I can't tell you first-hand
about his movements yesterday,

16:42.200 --> 16:46.760
But, um, he left the building
at, um...

16:48.200 --> 16:50.400
...18:38.

16:50.400 --> 16:52.200
He had a lot to clear
before end of term.

16:52.200 --> 16:53.520
He was leaving, you see.

16:53.520 --> 16:55.280
Mm. Japan.

16:55.280 --> 16:57.280
Yes, yes.

16:58.520 --> 16:59.920
Gosh, it's appalling.

16:59.920 --> 17:02.200
He was very --
very well liked

17:02.200 --> 17:03.960
with, um, staff and --

17:03.960 --> 17:05.360
and the student body.

17:05.360 --> 17:07.240
And, um, a very, you know,
popular teacher.

17:07.240 --> 17:09.480
And head of department,
I mean.

17:09.480 --> 17:12.600
Would you say
you were friends?

17:12.600 --> 17:15.800
We -- Well, we weren't
bosom buddies.

17:15.800 --> 17:17.480
We had our differences.

17:17.480 --> 17:19.440
But, goodness,
I hired him, didn't I?

17:22.160 --> 17:24.400
We'll need to see
Mr. Cowie's office

17:24.400 --> 17:28.000
and access any online facility
he had here at the school.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.920
Obviously discretion
is paramount

17:29.920 --> 17:32.080
while we conduct
our investigation

17:32.080 --> 17:34.200
I'll do my best
to keep a lid on it, Detective,

17:34.200 --> 17:36.720
but his daughter, Flo,
is a pupil here.

17:36.720 --> 17:38.240
So are all her friends.

17:38.240 --> 17:40.960
If you follow me down
the staff corridor.

17:42.440 --> 17:45.000
Is it true?
About Oliver?

17:45.000 --> 17:46.680
The security guard's saying --

17:46.680 --> 17:49.080
I'll pop into the staff room
shortly, Miss Turner.

17:58.880 --> 18:01.200
Can you think of any pupils,
past or present,

18:01.200 --> 18:03.000
who may have held a grudge?

18:03.000 --> 18:04.760
Or their parents even?

18:04.760 --> 18:06.440
I mean, this is

18:06.440 --> 18:08.240
the International School
of Chelsea, Detective.

18:08.240 --> 18:11.200
I mean, it's competitive, yes,
and obviously some pupils

18:11.200 --> 18:13.440
fail their baccalaureate,
but really...

18:13.440 --> 18:16.400
- What about a staff member?
- Oh, that's absurd.

18:16.400 --> 18:18.440
We're just going through
all possibilities, Mr. Green.

18:22.520 --> 18:24.040
Thank you.

18:30.760 --> 18:32.640
I still can't
quite believe it.

18:32.640 --> 18:34.080
His poor family

18:37.520 --> 18:40.560
We'll send a team
to collect his belongings.

18:43.400 --> 18:46.440
And we'll need to liaise
with your pastoral care.

18:49.640 --> 18:50.600
Nice view.

18:52.520 --> 18:54.800
Oh!

18:54.800 --> 18:56.880
That's new.

18:56.880 --> 18:58.240
Bloody estate kids.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.800
Oh, yeah,
that is impressive.

19:11.040 --> 19:13.400
"Deadwood Price"?

19:13.400 --> 19:16.120
Is that the graffiti artist
or a musician?

19:27.960 --> 19:29.440
Or an anagram.

19:30.280 --> 19:32.040
"Drop dead, Cowie."

19:33.360 --> 19:34.280
Huh.

19:43.040 --> 19:44.560
Same glasses as the victim.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.480
- He's chicken?
- It's a boy chicken, mate.

19:48.480 --> 19:50.640
A cock.

19:54.880 --> 19:56.640
We checked the security cameras.

19:56.640 --> 19:59.720
The artist painted over
the CCTV camera around 6:00,

19:59.720 --> 20:02.640
after the security guard
locked up.

20:02.640 --> 20:04.760
Message is on the money, anyway.

20:04.760 --> 20:08.400
It's a bit of a giveaway
pointing out your animosity

20:08.400 --> 20:10.480
so publicly when you're
about to commit murder.

20:10.480 --> 20:12.760
Maybe they thought the anagram
was foolproof.

20:12.760 --> 20:14.000
Teenagers, right?

20:14.000 --> 20:16.400
Who says it's a teenager?

20:16.400 --> 20:20.200
You know, a piece like this
takes skill and planning.

20:20.200 --> 20:22.440
They've left us a signature anyway.

20:22.440 --> 20:25.680
I've seen that around.

20:25.680 --> 20:27.720
Anything further on that bike
that the neighbor saw?

20:27.720 --> 20:29.400
Nothing.

20:29.400 --> 20:31.920
Got confirmation
on Florence Cowie's alibi --

20:31.920 --> 20:33.200
Petal Fisk, school friend.

20:33.200 --> 20:34.720
Dad works nights
as a staff nurse,

20:34.720 --> 20:36.480
so Florence often stays over.

20:36.480 --> 20:37.920
The families are friends.

20:37.920 --> 20:39.200
Turns out a couple of our lot

20:39.200 --> 20:40.680
called 'round
to the Cowies' place

20:40.680 --> 20:43.400
only two nights ago
about a domestic.

20:43.400 --> 20:46.760
So much for
the perfect couple.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.280
It was a stupid row.

20:54.440 --> 20:56.040
But there was
angry shouting, wasn't there?

20:56.040 --> 20:57.920
And something smashed?

21:01.120 --> 21:03.200
Did your husband
ever hit you, Lyn?

21:03.200 --> 21:05.560
What? No!

21:07.240 --> 21:11.040
Look, I lost my temper.

21:11.040 --> 21:12.200
That's all.

21:12.200 --> 21:14.200
Okay.

21:14.200 --> 21:16.040
What did you lose
your temper about?

21:18.400 --> 21:20.720
I thought he was having
an affair.

21:23.480 --> 21:27.000
And I flipped
because it's been a nightmare

21:27.000 --> 21:31.320
having to pack up and move
yet again.

21:33.680 --> 21:36.000
London was supposed to be
the last time.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.400
He promised.

21:38.400 --> 21:41.880
Finally found something
that I loved.

21:41.880 --> 21:43.360
And he was offered some...

21:43.360 --> 21:45.240
But he isn't.

21:46.280 --> 21:47.960
Wasn't.

21:47.960 --> 21:50.960
But what made you think he was
in the first place?

21:50.960 --> 21:54.280
I saw a text appear
on his screen

21:54.280 --> 21:56.880
from a female colleague,

21:56.880 --> 22:01.680
thanking him for being
"so great last night."

22:04.440 --> 22:06.400
Can you believe the cliché?

22:06.400 --> 22:09.400
And there had been
this staff night out,

22:09.400 --> 22:13.400
so my imagination went nuts.

22:13.400 --> 22:16.480
But Oliver explained he'd only
driven her home

22:16.480 --> 22:17.920
'cause she was drunk.

22:17.920 --> 22:19.720
He was kind like that.

22:21.360 --> 22:22.680
Genuinely.

22:22.680 --> 22:26.400
- And you believed him?
- Yes.

22:26.400 --> 22:31.240
I even remembered him mentioning
it once I'd calmed down.

22:31.240 --> 22:35.360
I was upset. I'd just handed in
my notice at the yoga studio.

22:37.240 --> 22:38.960
Do you know
this female colleague?

22:38.960 --> 22:42.280
I've never actually met her,
but her name's Saskia.

22:44.920 --> 22:46.200
Saskia Turner.

23:03.200 --> 23:05.840
- I bet you loved school.
- I did, actually.

23:05.840 --> 23:08.480
I was one of those
bloody estate kids.

23:08.480 --> 23:10.400
I bet you were head girl.

23:10.400 --> 23:13.720
You weren't one of those
estate kids, Max Arnold.

23:13.720 --> 23:15.600
I was Chelsea Grammar boy.

23:15.600 --> 23:17.720
Not that the grammar part
did me much good.

23:17.720 --> 23:19.760
Couldn't even spell.

23:19.760 --> 23:23.440
Must've been tough,
being dyslexic in the '80s.

23:23.440 --> 23:26.040
Mm. It was.

23:26.040 --> 23:28.400
Academically.

23:28.400 --> 23:31.040
How you see yourself,
how others see you,

23:31.040 --> 23:34.080
has a knock-on effect.

23:34.080 --> 23:36.720
It was all
very character-building.

23:36.720 --> 23:38.120
And look at you now.

23:39.920 --> 23:41.520
I <i>was</i> head girl.

23:53.640 --> 23:55.360
Where were you last night,
Saskia?

23:56.640 --> 23:59.920
At home, marking books.

23:59.920 --> 24:01.360
Ask any teacher.
It's relentless.

24:01.360 --> 24:02.960
Can anyone back that up?

24:04.200 --> 24:08.400
Uh, my flatmate stays with
her boyfriend during the week.

24:08.400 --> 24:10.760
But, I mean,
I -- I didn't kill Oliver,

24:10.760 --> 24:11.960
if that's what you're saying.

24:11.960 --> 24:14.960
I really liked him.

24:14.960 --> 24:17.680
What were you sorry about,
then?

24:17.680 --> 24:19.000
Yesterday evening,

24:19.000 --> 24:20.440
a few hours
before he was murdered,

24:20.440 --> 24:23.960
you sent a text --
"Sorry about everything."

24:23.960 --> 24:26.000
He deleted it
before replying.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.200
What I meant was,

24:28.200 --> 24:32.280
I'm sorry
if I caused him any trouble.

24:32.280 --> 24:33.960
Okay.

24:33.960 --> 24:35.560
And what kind of trouble
would that have been?

24:35.560 --> 24:37.200
With the school.

24:37.200 --> 24:38.720
With the position
I put him in.

24:38.720 --> 24:42.200
Um, over an issue.

24:43.520 --> 24:45.080
A-A work thing.

24:46.880 --> 24:50.400
So why do you think Oliver Cowie
deleted your apology?

24:50.400 --> 24:51.840
Don't know.

24:54.200 --> 24:57.000
What about the staff party,
Saskia?

24:57.000 --> 24:59.240
I believe he drove you home,
right?

25:00.680 --> 25:02.880
The apology, was it something

25:02.880 --> 25:05.080
that Oliver didn't want
his wife to know?

25:07.760 --> 25:11.400
I got drunk.
I made a fool of myself.

25:11.400 --> 25:13.880
I tried to kiss him.
I know I shouldn't have.

25:13.880 --> 25:16.480
And obviously he stopped me.

25:16.480 --> 25:19.160
Said it was inappropriate,
and it was.

25:19.160 --> 25:21.560
I can't believe I did that to
Oliver after everything he's...

25:22.920 --> 25:25.680
He was backing me
in a formal complaint

25:25.680 --> 25:28.040
about James Green.

25:29.800 --> 25:32.840
Sexual harassment.

25:32.840 --> 25:35.400
Unwanted touching.

25:35.400 --> 25:39.200
Always getting way too close,
you know?

25:39.200 --> 25:40.720
Little massages.

25:40.720 --> 25:42.000
Stuff.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.440
And he wouldn't take the hint,

25:43.440 --> 25:46.600
and you can't argue
'cause he's the boss, right?

25:46.600 --> 25:49.680
So Oliver's...

25:49.680 --> 25:52.840
was the more senior.

25:52.840 --> 25:55.720
So he said he'd have a word,
spare James his blushes.

25:55.720 --> 25:57.760
But James denied it.

25:57.760 --> 26:00.200
So I made it official.

26:00.200 --> 26:02.600
Okay.

26:02.600 --> 26:04.400
When was this?

26:04.400 --> 26:07.400
Yesterday morning, while
James was still in Brussels.

26:07.400 --> 26:09.720
Would James
have been informed?

26:09.720 --> 26:11.200
It's part of the process.

26:11.200 --> 26:14.040
How did he take it?

26:26.680 --> 26:28.040
Max.

26:41.960 --> 26:43.880
What are you doing
in here?

26:43.880 --> 26:46.600
I could ask you
the same thing.

26:46.600 --> 26:50.000
It's a faculty matter.
Nothing to do with the police.

26:50.000 --> 26:51.480
This office
has been quarantined.

26:51.480 --> 26:53.680
Maybe so, but it's still
school property,

26:53.680 --> 26:56.080
and as such, I'm in charge.

26:56.080 --> 26:58.160
This is a murder case,
Mr. Green,

26:58.160 --> 27:01.400
and as such, we the police
are in charge.

27:01.400 --> 27:04.200
In fact, we have a few things
to ask you

27:04.200 --> 27:05.920
about the night of the murder,

27:05.920 --> 27:08.360
if you wouldn't mind
stopping by the station.

27:11.640 --> 27:14.640
Yeah. Once I've contacted
my solicitor.

27:14.640 --> 27:17.080
Much appreciated.

27:32.720 --> 27:35.400
James Green's solicitor called.

27:35.400 --> 27:37.640
They'll be at the station
late morning.

27:37.640 --> 27:39.200
Oh, great.

27:39.200 --> 27:41.720
That'll give us a chance
to speak to Ashley first.

27:43.200 --> 27:45.200
Can you hold on, Max?
Thanks.

27:49.800 --> 27:51.280
You go see Daddy.

27:52.880 --> 27:55.040
Mm.

27:55.040 --> 27:56.960
Hey.

27:56.960 --> 27:58.440
Don't forget, I'm out tonight.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.200
Hey.

28:01.200 --> 28:02.440
Okay, I'll see you
at the mortuary.

28:02.440 --> 28:04.440
Mortuary?

28:05.920 --> 28:07.720
It's where you get
to sleep forever.

28:19.440 --> 28:21.760
Contents of his stomach
suggest time of death

28:21.760 --> 28:23.760
was the earlier side
of my window,

28:23.760 --> 28:26.240
say 9:00 or 10:00 p.m.

28:26.240 --> 28:29.840
Seven or eight blows altogether,

28:29.840 --> 28:32.440
from the separate bruises
and tears on the scalp.

28:32.440 --> 28:36.280
I'd say four were direct
and the rest tangential.

28:36.280 --> 28:38.200
He probably
lost consciousness quickly,

28:38.200 --> 28:40.400
hence no defense wounds,

28:40.400 --> 28:43.920
and the intracranial bleeding
finished him off.

28:43.920 --> 28:45.720
And the weapon?

28:45.720 --> 28:47.920
The trophy would fit.

28:47.920 --> 28:49.520
This is the same make.

28:50.960 --> 28:54.120
Even as a layman, you can see
how the edges would work,

28:54.120 --> 28:57.600
and the side here
for maximum damage.

28:59.200 --> 29:01.360
Now we just have to find it.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.080
Green's in
with his solicitor now.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.720
Okay.

29:12.720 --> 29:17.640
Well, we know there was
bad blood between him and Cowie.

29:17.640 --> 29:20.400
We know he's arrogant enough
to muck the police about.

29:20.400 --> 29:22.560
Just because he was in Brussels
doesn't mean

29:22.560 --> 29:23.960
he couldn't get someone
to do his dirty work.

29:25.200 --> 29:26.880
Except he wasn't.

29:26.880 --> 29:29.680
James Green was booked
on the 8:00 Eurostar,

29:29.680 --> 29:31.880
but he boarded an earlier train.

29:31.880 --> 29:35.120
This one got him
into St. Pancras at 8:25.

29:35.120 --> 29:36.960
That gives him plenty of leeway
to get to Chelsea

29:36.960 --> 29:38.960
within Ashley's kill time.

29:38.960 --> 29:40.040
Yeah.

29:41.840 --> 29:43.400
If you know about
the accusations,

29:43.400 --> 29:45.160
then you'll understand
why I wanted to return

29:45.160 --> 29:46.680
to London
as soon as possible,

29:46.680 --> 29:48.080
clear my name.

29:48.080 --> 29:50.040
And how
did you go about that?

29:57.200 --> 29:59.520
Where were you
between 8:30 and 10:00

29:59.520 --> 30:02.240
on Tuesday night, Mr. Green?

30:02.240 --> 30:04.640
I went to the school,
if you must know.

30:04.640 --> 30:06.720
Straight from the station.

30:06.720 --> 30:09.200
And your fob will show a record
of your comings and goings?

30:14.440 --> 30:16.680
It'll also show that I went
into Oliver's office.

30:16.680 --> 30:19.160
Another faculty matter?

30:19.160 --> 30:23.640
I wanted to check his computer,
see what he'd said to the board.

30:23.640 --> 30:26.000
But his laptop wasn't there.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.040
It occurred to me
that he might have kept

30:28.040 --> 30:29.560
some sort of written record.

30:29.560 --> 30:31.160
No.

30:31.160 --> 30:33.400
You thought,
with Oliver out the way,

30:33.400 --> 30:35.280
all you'd have to do
is pressure Saskia

30:35.280 --> 30:37.560
into withdrawing
her complaint.

30:37.560 --> 30:40.960
I wouldn't want the man dead,
for God's sake!

30:40.960 --> 30:43.760
I just wanted to protect
my thus far unblemished record

30:43.760 --> 30:45.440
from a personal vendetta.

30:45.440 --> 30:48.600
I mean, my God.
All because I'm friendly?

30:48.600 --> 30:51.880
Well, let's go back
to that night.

30:51.880 --> 30:54.240
What did you do after
you left Cowie's office?

30:54.240 --> 30:55.240
Go home?

30:55.240 --> 30:57.920
I went for a walk.

30:57.920 --> 31:01.320
I bought a pint at, um,

31:01.320 --> 31:04.520
that pub on Shawhill Street,
The Cinder.

31:04.520 --> 31:06.680
I sat outside for a while.

31:06.680 --> 31:09.200
I wanted to think.

31:09.200 --> 31:11.080
And I didn't want my wife
to know

31:11.080 --> 31:13.680
that I'd taken
an earlier train.

31:13.680 --> 31:18.200
She was, until now, unaware
of these false allegations,

31:18.200 --> 31:21.080
which clearly she is
very upset by.

31:21.080 --> 31:24.040
Mrs. Green has
our heartfelt sympathy.

31:36.000 --> 31:38.520
Okay, thanks.

31:38.520 --> 31:41.680
The pub have Green
buying the pint at 9:25,

31:41.680 --> 31:44.400
but there's
no CCTV coverage outside.

31:44.400 --> 31:45.720
We don't know when he left.

31:45.720 --> 31:47.240
He could have knocked back
his drink,

31:47.240 --> 31:49.440
then gone to Fernlea Place
and killed Cowie.

31:49.440 --> 31:51.520
Pretty tight if we have him
back home at 10:30,

31:51.520 --> 31:53.240
which his wife confirms.

31:53.240 --> 31:55.280
He could have done it
between the school and the pub

31:55.280 --> 31:56.840
while he was out "walking."

31:56.840 --> 31:58.200
He'd have needed a drink
after that.

31:58.200 --> 32:00.040
He'd be covered in blood, Max.

32:02.480 --> 32:04.200
Okay.
Let him go.

32:04.200 --> 32:06.680
But tell him we'll need to
speak to him again.

32:06.680 --> 32:08.680
The school's pastoral care
have been back.

32:08.680 --> 32:10.120
There were only three pupils

32:10.120 --> 32:11.880
that clashed with Cowie
in the last year.

32:11.880 --> 32:13.400
Two have since moved abroad,

32:13.400 --> 32:15.680
but the third
hadn't even been processed.

32:15.680 --> 32:19.560
Eric Heidegger, 18.
Poor academic record.

32:19.560 --> 32:22.000
Casualty of too many schools,
the counselor says.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.680
Dad's an exec
for a German shipping company.

32:24.680 --> 32:26.480
Cowie cut Eric some slack,

32:26.480 --> 32:27.920
but it seems
even he ran out of patience

32:27.920 --> 32:29.360
when Eric spray-painted

32:29.360 --> 32:32.240
"Cowie's a cock"
in the junior playground.

32:32.240 --> 32:34.440
Looks like we've found
our artist.

32:34.440 --> 32:36.080
Yeah, and listen to this --

32:36.080 --> 32:38.760
Cowie suspended Eric
pending an exclusion hearing

32:38.760 --> 32:39.960
the day of the murder.

32:39.960 --> 32:41.680
Let's get his address.

32:41.680 --> 32:44.160
So I checked in with
Lyn Cowie's yoga studio.

32:44.160 --> 32:45.840
She was on the rota
to teach a class,

32:45.840 --> 32:47.640
but turns out someone
stepped in last-minute.

32:47.640 --> 32:49.240
Okay.

32:49.240 --> 32:51.200
You and Connor go and have
a little chat,

32:51.200 --> 32:52.760
with Eric Heidegger,

32:52.760 --> 32:55.280
and we'll see what Lyn Cowie
has to say.

33:06.360 --> 33:08.000
I've got a shift,
I'm afraid,

33:08.000 --> 33:11.440
but Lyn's outside
and the girls are upstairs.

33:11.440 --> 33:13.760
I said they can stay
as long as they want.

33:13.760 --> 33:15.760
It's as much for Petal
as it is for them.

33:15.760 --> 33:17.240
She's had a tough time.

33:17.240 --> 33:18.640
She lost her mother
a few years ago,

33:18.640 --> 33:20.400
and this has kind of
pushed all her buttons.

33:20.400 --> 33:22.760
I'm sorry. That must have
been really tough.

33:22.760 --> 33:24.640
Yeah.

33:24.640 --> 33:26.680
Well, at least they've got
each other.

33:30.640 --> 33:34.360
Anyway I'll, uh,
leave you to it.

33:34.360 --> 33:35.920
Yeah.

33:38.480 --> 33:41.440
You need to start
telling us the truth, Lyn.

33:44.880 --> 33:47.000
I went to meet a friend.

33:47.000 --> 33:51.000
An old uni mate.
Darren Floyd.

33:51.000 --> 33:54.080
We just went for a drink
at a bistro on Chelsea Green.

33:55.640 --> 33:59.480
It's not what you think.
He's a family lawyer.

33:59.480 --> 34:01.600
Divorce lawyer.

34:01.600 --> 34:04.120
You were planning to divorce
your husband?

34:04.120 --> 34:08.040
I just wanted to know
what my options are.

34:10.200 --> 34:11.280
Were.

34:11.280 --> 34:13.960
- Because of Saskia Turner?
- No.

34:13.960 --> 34:18.560
I didn't really care about
all that nonsense with Saskia.

34:20.920 --> 34:23.040
It's been a difficult year.

34:25.000 --> 34:28.400
When I thought, for a moment,

34:28.400 --> 34:30.440
that Oliver might be having
an affair,

34:30.440 --> 34:33.680
I was jealous,
but not of her.

34:33.680 --> 34:35.360
Of him.

34:35.360 --> 34:37.920
That's what I wanted.

34:37.920 --> 34:41.880
I owned my own business once,
you know?

34:41.880 --> 34:45.120
I sold up so Oliver
could take Canberra.

34:46.960 --> 34:52.360
I lied because I didn't want Flo
knowing I was unhappy!

34:52.360 --> 34:54.080
She's had enough!

34:55.400 --> 34:57.600
Did you know Oliver was involved
in a complaint

34:57.600 --> 34:58.760
about the head teacher?

35:03.200 --> 35:06.040
Everyone's knight
in shining armor.

35:07.600 --> 35:09.440
Except mine.

35:15.840 --> 35:19.280
- You can't tell them.
- I promise I won't. I swear.

35:19.280 --> 35:20.840
Wouldn't just be me lying, Petal.

35:20.840 --> 35:22.640
You already said
I was with you.

35:22.640 --> 35:25.240
But, Flo,
I'm your best friend.

35:27.360 --> 35:30.640
When my mum died,

35:30.640 --> 35:33.440
I thought I'd die too.

35:33.440 --> 35:36.200
Literally.
But you won't, Flo.

35:36.200 --> 35:38.240
Your mum died of cancer, Petal.

35:38.240 --> 35:40.960
She wasn't killed.

35:40.960 --> 35:43.280
She didn't get her head
smashed in!

35:43.280 --> 35:45.760
You loved your mum.

35:45.760 --> 35:47.240
You looked after her
when she was sick.

35:47.240 --> 35:49.600
And I told my dad
I hated him!

35:52.160 --> 35:55.480
You can't just fix this
by telling me

35:55.480 --> 35:56.720
it'll all get better.

35:59.280 --> 36:00.520
What's going on?

36:00.520 --> 36:02.800
- I want to go home.
- What?

36:04.960 --> 36:08.120
Oh, sweetheart.

36:31.560 --> 36:34.040
Mr. Heidegger?
Can we have a word, please?

36:36.400 --> 36:38.000
Come in.

36:42.680 --> 36:45.040
It's your son we need
to speak to, Mr. Heidegger.

36:45.040 --> 36:46.880
Eric? What for?

36:46.880 --> 36:49.600
There was a very serious
incident two nights ago.

36:49.600 --> 36:52.400
An attack on a teacher from the
International School of Chelsea.

36:52.400 --> 36:54.720
My wife, she texted.

36:54.720 --> 36:56.440
Well, perhaps we can speak
to her, then?

36:56.440 --> 36:57.960
I'm sorry, she's in Bern.

36:57.960 --> 36:59.360
Her mother had a bad fall.

36:59.360 --> 37:01.480
I could have her call you
if that helps.

37:01.480 --> 37:04.480
Was Eric at home on Tuesday
evening, Mr. Heidegger?

37:04.480 --> 37:06.640
Yes, of course.

37:06.640 --> 37:08.440
Tuesday, Eric,
I said you could order in

37:08.440 --> 37:10.520
because Mum wanted
an early night.

37:10.520 --> 37:11.840
Tell them, Eric.

37:11.840 --> 37:13.920
Detective Constable
Jess Lombard,

37:13.920 --> 37:16.000
and this is DC Connor Pollock.

37:16.000 --> 37:17.040
Eric!

37:18.640 --> 37:20.560
- Eric!
- Stay there!

37:23.160 --> 37:24.280
He's heading
towards the estate.

37:24.280 --> 37:26.280
I'm on it!

38:19.160 --> 38:22.080
All right, Michelangelo.
You dropped your paints.

38:45.800 --> 38:47.600
See, four grand in March,

38:47.600 --> 38:50.680
and the same in January,
and more the year before.

38:50.680 --> 38:52.680
Payee reference "RAF."

38:52.680 --> 38:54.480
Lyn Cowie claims not to know
anything about it.

38:54.480 --> 38:56.520
Hmm.

38:56.520 --> 38:59.400
Standing order,
some form of payment?

38:59.400 --> 39:01.240
I'll put a trace
on the account number.

39:02.400 --> 39:04.400
Max, the on-call brief
has arrived.

39:04.400 --> 39:05.440
Oh.

39:08.160 --> 39:10.880
I didn't do anything.
I swear.

39:10.880 --> 39:12.400
I was home with my mum.

39:12.400 --> 39:17.120
Yes, we've spoken to her,
and she confirmed that.

39:17.120 --> 39:20.960
She also confirmed that
your father was in his office

39:20.960 --> 39:24.400
at Imperial Wharf
overseeing a late shipment

39:24.400 --> 39:26.920
and that she herself
went to bed at 8:30.

39:26.920 --> 39:29.960
So neither of your parents
saw you after that time.

39:29.960 --> 39:31.800
That's not my fault.

39:38.920 --> 39:41.080
So why did you leg it?

39:41.080 --> 39:43.800
I-I thought I was getting done
for tagging.

39:43.800 --> 39:45.360
I-I was freaking out.

39:45.360 --> 39:47.080
There were rumors
something went down at school.

39:47.080 --> 39:50.280
But you were the one who
spray-painted "Drop dead Cowie"

39:50.280 --> 39:51.480
the day he suspended you.

39:51.480 --> 39:53.240
I just wanted to prove it
to him.

39:53.240 --> 39:54.840
If I wanted to say
he was a cock,

39:54.840 --> 39:58.000
I'd do it better than what
they pinned on me at school.

39:58.000 --> 40:00.240
Stitched me up, man.

40:00.240 --> 40:03.360
- Who stitched you up, Eric?
- Cowie.

40:03.360 --> 40:05.680
He said someone saw me,
which wasn't true.

40:05.680 --> 40:08.200
Plus, he planted
a can of paint in my bag

40:08.200 --> 40:09.920
which wasn't mine.

40:09.920 --> 40:13.000
Fact.
I don't care what you think.

40:13.000 --> 40:14.960
I know what I did
and didn't do.

40:14.960 --> 40:17.200
And no way am I putting
my name on this.

40:19.680 --> 40:22.960
Why would Mr. Cowie risk
his professional reputation

40:22.960 --> 40:24.720
to stitch you up, Eric?

40:24.720 --> 40:26.720
Obvious.

40:26.720 --> 40:29.080
To me, anyway.

40:29.080 --> 40:30.520
I got back
with his daughter.

40:30.520 --> 40:33.400
Sorry?
Got <i>back</i> with?

40:33.400 --> 40:36.840
We went out, for six months
maybe, before he killed it.

40:40.960 --> 40:42.760
Have you got a bicycle,
Eric?

40:47.920 --> 40:49.640
So, what do you reckon?

40:49.640 --> 40:53.400
Mum's fast asleep,
Dad's not home till 1:00 a.m.

40:53.400 --> 40:56.200
Eric could have been, done it,
and gone to bed by then.

40:56.200 --> 40:57.760
But?

40:57.760 --> 41:00.080
Well, no, I can't see him
covering his tracks

41:00.080 --> 41:01.960
and keeping his head
all this time.

41:01.960 --> 41:04.440
- I heard he's a bag of nerves.
- Yeah.

41:04.440 --> 41:06.440
Well, let's see what
we've got anyway.

41:06.440 --> 41:07.720
Thank you.

41:07.720 --> 41:10.240
In the meantime,
I've checked Lyn's story.

41:10.240 --> 41:12.120
Her lawyer mate supports
her account

41:12.120 --> 41:13.960
and the bistro
where they met.

41:13.960 --> 41:16.520
I've asked for CCTV
to confirm.

41:16.520 --> 41:19.880
So Lyn and her daughter
now have solid alibis.

41:19.880 --> 41:23.640
- Mm.
- But Saskia Turner doesn't.

41:25.400 --> 41:30.200
Just cause her boss is sleazy
doesn't mean she liked Cowie.

41:30.200 --> 41:31.000
I don't know.

41:32.280 --> 41:35.240
Her texts are
"Thanks for being great,"

41:35.240 --> 41:37.240
"Sorry for being an idiot."

41:37.240 --> 41:39.400
Doesn't scream "stalker."

41:39.400 --> 41:42.160
There's nothing of note
on any CCTV

41:42.160 --> 41:44.600
local to the Cowie house
on Fernlea Close.

41:44.600 --> 41:46.400
Multiple prints
on the front door,

41:46.400 --> 41:47.680
including the family's

41:47.680 --> 41:49.400
and Carmel the cleaner, obviously,

41:49.400 --> 41:51.200
but nothing else
that checks out.

41:51.200 --> 41:53.920
Who else knew
Oliver was home alone?

41:53.920 --> 41:57.200
I've found who RAF is.

41:57.200 --> 41:59.120
A is for Alistair,
his middle initial.

41:59.120 --> 42:01.200
- Rory Fisk.
- Of course.

42:01.200 --> 42:02.960
Cowie's been
giving him money.

42:02.960 --> 42:05.640
- 10
- K over the last year. Regular installments.

42:05.640 --> 42:07.480
Giving?
Or paying?

42:12.120 --> 42:14.080
Her bursary ran out
the previous year,

42:14.080 --> 42:16.640
and I couldn't afford to keep
her at the school without it.

42:16.640 --> 42:20.120
And Oliver knew how
good Petal's grades were.

42:20.120 --> 42:22.040
Him and I
become close friends

42:22.040 --> 42:24.920
after the girls teamed up.

42:24.920 --> 42:26.840
Why not
pay the school direct?

42:26.840 --> 42:31.240
Just to save my pride,
so that I could pay the school.

42:31.240 --> 42:32.720
He didn't even tell Lyn
about it.

42:32.720 --> 42:34.440
Just told me to pay him back
whenever I could.

42:34.440 --> 42:37.480
Which of course I will.

42:37.480 --> 42:38.800
Somehow.

42:42.400 --> 42:44.880
You were on shift here
the night of the murder?

42:44.880 --> 42:46.920
Yeah.

42:46.920 --> 42:50.040
I mean I did nip out
for a burger during my break.

42:52.200 --> 42:53.960
Do you know a kid
called Eric Heidegger?

42:53.960 --> 42:55.760
He's on-off with Flo.

42:55.760 --> 42:58.840
I knew she had some kind of
boyfriend mucking her about.

42:58.840 --> 43:01.800
You know,
Petal is such a worrier.

43:01.800 --> 43:05.200
But I have noticed a difference
in Flo's behavior recently.

43:05.200 --> 43:06.440
Like what?

43:06.440 --> 43:09.920
Or just you know,
temperament, mood swings.

43:09.920 --> 43:11.960
It's a teenager's job
description, isn't it?

43:11.960 --> 43:13.680
Yeah, of course it is.

43:13.680 --> 43:15.960
I mean, don't get me wrong.
I'm really fond of Flo.

43:15.960 --> 43:18.520
The Cowies moved back to London
after my wife died,

43:18.520 --> 43:21.560
and Flo was missing
her school in Australia.

43:21.560 --> 43:23.680
Her and Petal just kind
of saved each other, you know?

43:25.240 --> 43:28.080
But recently she's been
getting up to all sorts.

43:28.080 --> 43:29.960
Did you talk to Oliver
about it?

43:29.960 --> 43:31.640
Oh, yeah, he knew all about it.

43:31.640 --> 43:35.960
It was him that she was
rebelling against, mostly.

43:35.960 --> 43:38.960
But at least with Petal,
she does her homework.

43:38.960 --> 43:41.000
And I can't exactly ban Flo
from the house, can I,

43:41.000 --> 43:44.040
given Oliver's generosity?

43:46.480 --> 43:49.000
You must have been
a little relieved, then.

43:49.000 --> 43:52.200
- About Japan.
- If I'm honest.

43:54.000 --> 43:56.800
I just can't believe
what's happened.

43:58.080 --> 44:00.000
Him and I were really close,
you know?

44:00.000 --> 44:01.720
We were good friends.

44:01.720 --> 44:03.680
If you think of anything else,
please do let us know.

44:22.680 --> 44:25.400
Hi, it's me.

44:25.400 --> 44:29.680
Listen, the police have just
called 'round to talk to me.

44:29.680 --> 44:32.240
I know, I know.

44:32.240 --> 44:36.200
I know, but I think
it would be a good idea

44:36.200 --> 44:38.240
if we just kept our distance,

44:38.240 --> 44:40.840
just until things
blow over, okay?

44:42.800 --> 44:44.120
Okay.

45:51.440 --> 45:54.440
Hey, do I have time for a run
before you go?

45:54.440 --> 45:58.000
- Not a chance.
- But you're still working.

45:58.000 --> 45:59.960
Because I had to
put Poppy down.

45:59.960 --> 46:01.520
Oh, I'm sorry.

46:01.520 --> 46:03.760
Just let me finish this report.
It's nearly done.

46:03.760 --> 46:05.760
Oh!

46:05.760 --> 46:07.920
See?
She won't settle.

46:07.920 --> 46:09.080
It's like she's knows
I'm up against it.

46:11.480 --> 46:13.040
I'll go check on her.

46:42.200 --> 46:43.960
Boom.

46:43.960 --> 46:46.240
Lyn and her lawyer pal,
just where they said they were.

46:46.240 --> 46:49.200
Nice one.

46:49.200 --> 46:50.480
Oh.

46:50.480 --> 46:52.840
That's my cab.
Do you want a lift?

46:52.840 --> 46:55.240
No, thanks.
I'm gonna crack on here.

46:55.240 --> 46:56.880
How come the cab?

46:56.880 --> 47:00.080
Helen gets back
from her mate's hen do tonight.

47:00.080 --> 47:01.720
And you've trashed
the place?

47:02.920 --> 47:05.000
I'm picking up some flowers

47:05.000 --> 47:07.800
and a bottle
to welcome her home.

47:09.240 --> 47:11.240
Okay.

47:11.240 --> 47:13.680
And I've trashed the place.

47:15.720 --> 47:17.240
Night.

47:21.440 --> 47:23.080
Right.

47:34.960 --> 47:37.000
Looks like we both
had a day of it.

47:37.000 --> 47:39.640
At least you had
some adult company.

47:39.640 --> 47:40.880
You want to talk about it?

47:40.880 --> 47:43.880
Oh, I just want to
go to the pub.

47:43.880 --> 47:45.760
Don't we all.

47:45.760 --> 47:48.360
Priya, these are
potential clients.

47:48.360 --> 47:50.040
- And even if they weren't.
- I'm sorry.

47:50.040 --> 47:51.520
- Sorry.
- It's not all about you.

47:51.520 --> 47:53.720
Okay.

47:53.720 --> 47:55.200
No, I'm sorry, I'm...

47:55.200 --> 47:56.960
- I do need...
- I know.

47:56.960 --> 48:00.520
I know. I get it.
Go!

48:00.520 --> 48:01.760
Let your hair down.

48:09.200 --> 48:11.280
- And don't slam the --
- No, okay.

48:28.840 --> 48:30.840
Do you think
he felt it, Mum?

48:33.240 --> 48:34.840
Do you think it hurt?

48:38.200 --> 48:40.200
I can't stop thinking...

48:41.640 --> 48:44.240
Did he see who did it?

48:44.240 --> 48:46.320
Did he know what was
about to happen?

48:48.760 --> 48:50.280
Was he scared?

48:55.160 --> 48:58.840
He didn't know anything.
He couldn't have.

49:00.520 --> 49:03.600
It would have been over
in an instant, I promise you.

49:45.120 --> 49:47.080
Don't you ever
stop working?

49:47.080 --> 49:48.960
You'll be glad I didn't
when you check your in-box.

49:53.640 --> 49:57.760
I'm just looking now.
It's downloading.

50:01.920 --> 50:03.880
Where did you get this?

50:03.880 --> 50:05.960
It was e-mailed
to Cowie's work account

50:05.960 --> 50:07.520
two weeks ago.

50:07.520 --> 50:11.520
Sender encrypted.
By an amateur.

50:33.720 --> 50:36.040
- Got him.
- Good.

50:40.600 --> 50:42.640
We know you sent this photo
to Oliver Cowie

50:42.640 --> 50:44.000
three weeks ago today.

50:44.000 --> 50:46.760
Is it common behavior
for teachers

50:46.760 --> 50:49.800
to take secret photos
of the pupils in their care?

50:49.800 --> 50:51.560
Well, obviously not.

50:53.480 --> 50:55.440
It looks a little off.
I can see that.

50:55.440 --> 50:57.440
Yes, it does.

50:57.440 --> 50:59.760
It was
a spur-of-the-moment thing.

50:59.760 --> 51:01.440
They were in the art department

51:01.440 --> 51:03.400
while the rest of their year
was in assembly.

51:03.400 --> 51:06.360
And I saw them
through the stairwell door.

51:06.360 --> 51:08.160
I was gonna haul them out.

51:08.160 --> 51:13.720
And then I thought, well,
it would mean exclusion for Flo.

51:13.720 --> 51:15.680
I was going to delete it
as soon as I took it.

51:15.680 --> 51:17.800
But you didn't.

51:17.800 --> 51:21.520
In fact you used this photo
as leverage against her father.

51:21.520 --> 51:25.240
Oliver was threatening
my entire career

51:25.240 --> 51:26.760
for little more than hearsay.

51:26.760 --> 51:28.840
I might never work again.

51:28.840 --> 51:30.560
My whole life would be affected.

51:33.600 --> 51:39.200
So I asked him to drop
his vendetta against me

51:39.200 --> 51:41.400
in exchange
for turning a blind eye.

51:41.400 --> 51:44.000
And how did that go down?

51:47.400 --> 51:49.120
He declined.

51:49.120 --> 51:51.840
You don't understand.
I tried to reason with him.

51:51.840 --> 51:53.360
He wouldn't listen.

51:53.360 --> 51:55.400
So, in Brussels you found out

51:55.400 --> 51:58.400
the formal complaint against you
had gone ahead,

51:58.400 --> 52:02.400
even though Oliver had
this photo on his laptop.

52:02.400 --> 52:06.760
So you were hoping he couldn't
find out you'd sent it.

52:06.760 --> 52:08.720
But maybe he could.

52:08.720 --> 52:11.760
Didn't take <i>us</i> long.
Right?

52:11.760 --> 52:13.640
Right.

52:13.640 --> 52:16.440
So you jumped on
an earlier Eurostar --

52:16.440 --> 52:20.280
Everything else I told you
is true -- except...

52:24.120 --> 52:26.480
That's what I was looking for
in his office.

52:26.480 --> 52:29.240
In case he'd kept a hard copy.

52:31.360 --> 52:34.800
Look,
it sounds worse than it is

52:36.600 --> 52:39.200
Blackmail,
concealing evidence,

52:39.200 --> 52:42.160
taking unlawful images
of juveniles.

52:42.160 --> 52:44.320
How much worse
does it need to be?

52:46.200 --> 52:47.680
Does this have to go
before the board?

52:51.760 --> 52:54.320
I think the school board is the
least of your problems, mate.

53:10.280 --> 53:12.040
Morning.
- Oh, hello.

53:12.040 --> 53:13.960
Is Mrs. Cowie home?

53:13.960 --> 53:15.720
She went to solicitors.

53:15.720 --> 53:18.040
There's a lot to sort out,
as you can imagine.

53:18.040 --> 53:21.240
Come in.
She said she'd hurry.

53:21.240 --> 53:23.200
She didn't want to leave
Flo alone too long.

53:23.200 --> 53:25.280
But Flo insisted
on going to school.

53:25.280 --> 53:27.200
I couldn't stop her.

53:27.200 --> 53:30.120
She needs her friends,
I suppose.

53:30.120 --> 53:32.000
Would you like a cup of tea?
I just boiled the kettle.

53:32.000 --> 53:34.040
Oh, yeah.
Tea would be lovely.

53:36.680 --> 53:39.720
I've been stocking up
the freezer for them, bless.

53:39.720 --> 53:41.520
They're lucky to have you.

53:41.520 --> 53:44.360
- Four years, was it?
- On contract.

53:44.360 --> 53:46.960
Paid sick leave, holidays,
the lot.

53:46.960 --> 53:49.680
Ask 'round who else gets that
who ain't working for a firm.

53:49.680 --> 53:51.920
They must really rate you.

53:51.920 --> 53:55.000
Well, trust begets trust,
I suppose.

53:55.000 --> 53:57.680
Must have been a bit
of a slap in the face, then.

53:59.440 --> 54:01.360
Uh, the move to Japan, I mean.

54:01.360 --> 54:04.680
- Must have been a blow.
- That's life.

54:04.680 --> 54:06.600
I had
something else lined up.

54:06.600 --> 54:07.880
I'd have thought Mrs. Cowie

54:07.880 --> 54:10.520
would need you
more than ever now.

54:10.520 --> 54:12.920
Lyn knows I'm here for her.

54:19.760 --> 54:21.400
I got your message
about Flo.

54:21.400 --> 54:23.080
She wouldn't
be stopped, Lyn.

54:23.080 --> 54:26.000
- Maybe it's best. I don't --
- Lyn. Police are here.

54:26.000 --> 54:28.200
In the kitchen.

54:28.200 --> 54:29.720
Okay.

54:39.920 --> 54:42.040
D.S. Shamsie.

54:45.240 --> 54:46.440
May we speak privately?

54:59.800 --> 55:01.640
Flo!

55:01.640 --> 55:03.760
- Are you following me?
- They've got my phone, Flo.

55:03.760 --> 55:05.080
I'm so sorry.

55:05.080 --> 55:06.880
I don't want to
talk to you.

55:06.880 --> 55:08.960
The police have been
all over me.

55:10.680 --> 55:12.520
Don't you dare
tell anyone about us.

55:12.520 --> 55:14.720
It won't change
anything now.

55:14.720 --> 55:16.600
I just want to
make this okay.

55:16.600 --> 55:19.600
Then leave me alone, Eric.
I can't stand to look at you!

55:44.720 --> 55:48.640
I knew nothing about this.

55:48.640 --> 55:50.440
It won't be the first time
you've lied to us, Lyn.

55:50.440 --> 55:52.480
Don't you think
I would have said

55:52.480 --> 55:56.160
if I knew that vile man
was blackmailing us?!

55:56.160 --> 55:58.200
He could be the one
who murdered Oliver!

56:01.400 --> 56:05.840
For God's sake!
It was him, right?

56:06.920 --> 56:08.400
We're talking to Mr. Green.

56:08.400 --> 56:10.120
And if there's a link,
we'll tell you.

56:16.840 --> 56:21.680
Oliver told me he'd caught
Flo and Eric with some vodka.

56:21.680 --> 56:25.480
That's why he banned Eric
from the house.

56:25.480 --> 56:28.240
Maybe your husband
was trying to protect you.

56:33.960 --> 56:36.120
That explains
why he was so...

56:37.440 --> 56:39.200
...rigid.

56:40.360 --> 56:41.960
He wouldn't even consider

56:41.960 --> 56:45.760
letting Flo stay with Petal
for her final year.

56:45.760 --> 56:47.440
And you disagreed?

56:47.440 --> 56:49.200
Flo was kicking off

56:49.200 --> 56:52.480
because we moved her around
so much.

56:52.480 --> 56:57.760
But underneath, she just
needed a bit of leeway

56:57.760 --> 57:02.760
to get through the next year
without ruining her future.

57:02.760 --> 57:08.520
Because Oliver's future
always came first.

57:11.080 --> 57:16.120
So, you see, it wasn't just
Saskia we were rowing about.

57:16.120 --> 57:18.520
Oliver thought the move
would solve everything.

57:18.520 --> 57:19.960
I didn't.

57:19.960 --> 57:21.440
Okay.

57:29.520 --> 57:33.200
Everything fits if it weren't
for his alibi at the pub.

57:33.200 --> 57:35.160
Maybe he did just
buy a pint and go.

57:35.160 --> 57:37.600
I mean, he's no stranger
to manipulating evidence.

57:37.600 --> 57:40.160
He's not very good at it,
though, is he?

57:40.160 --> 57:42.480
And he was bricking it
when we put the pressure on.

57:42.480 --> 57:44.920
I think
he would have cracked.

57:44.920 --> 57:48.680
So, what else have we got?

57:48.680 --> 57:50.920
Despite the spider signatures,

57:50.920 --> 57:52.800
I don't believe the kid
that painted that

57:52.800 --> 57:55.000
painted the first one.

57:55.000 --> 57:58.760
So maybe Cowie did set him up
to get rid of him.

57:58.760 --> 58:00.200
Why would he?

58:00.200 --> 58:02.240
To protect his daughter?

58:02.240 --> 58:05.000
He could hardly punish Eric
for the coke

58:05.000 --> 58:07.640
since Flo was just as guilty.

58:07.640 --> 58:10.400
He needed something
to fit him up with.

58:10.400 --> 58:13.080
It seems pretty juvenile
and unprofessional.

58:15.680 --> 58:18.280
Wasn't there a witness,
Eric said?

58:18.280 --> 58:20.400
Yes.

58:20.400 --> 58:24.280
Give the school a call
and check with pastoral care.

58:24.280 --> 58:26.520
Hah!
There's a guy in reception.

58:26.520 --> 58:27.960
Says he's a neighbor
of the victim,

58:27.960 --> 58:29.760
might have
some information.

58:29.760 --> 58:31.760
Ranjit Johal.

58:31.760 --> 58:33.680
He wasn't on the list
in the vicinity,

58:33.680 --> 58:35.920
so I don't know
if he's just a busybody.

58:45.480 --> 58:47.920
I live half a mile away,

58:47.920 --> 58:50.160
but I recognized him
from the paper.

58:50.160 --> 58:52.160
I've seen him
when I walk my dog.

58:52.160 --> 58:55.600
So you recognized Mr. Cowie
getting home from work

58:55.600 --> 58:56.800
or through the window?

58:56.800 --> 58:58.360
No, Officer.

58:58.360 --> 59:01.040
I saw him when he answered
the door to a man.

59:01.040 --> 59:03.680
Can you describe the man?

59:03.680 --> 59:05.640
His back was turned,
I'm afraid.

59:05.640 --> 59:09.520
But he was tall,
a white man.

59:09.520 --> 59:11.960
I could see his neck because
he had very short hair,

59:11.960 --> 59:14.760
and he was wearing
running clothes.

59:14.760 --> 59:17.600
It was too dark to tell
the color of the sweatshirt,

59:17.600 --> 59:19.680
but it had a cross on it,

59:19.680 --> 59:22.720
like a first-aid sign,
a plus sign?

59:22.720 --> 59:25.520
Like a paramedic
or a doctor?

59:25.520 --> 59:28.000
No, not like that,
just a sweatshirt.

59:28.000 --> 59:30.720
And he was annoyed.

59:30.720 --> 59:33.240
Gesturing, you know?

59:33.240 --> 59:36.080
Well, it seemed so, anyway. Sorry.

59:36.080 --> 59:39.000
You're being very helpful,
Mr. Johal.

59:39.000 --> 59:43.400
Did you notice a bicycle
leaning against the wall?

59:43.400 --> 59:46.600
Or did you get the impression
the man had cycled there?

59:46.600 --> 59:49.400
I thought he had been jogging.

59:49.400 --> 59:51.200
I didn't see a bicycle.

59:51.200 --> 59:53.120
Do you recall
what time this was?

59:53.120 --> 59:57.480
I always walk my dog at the same
time, listening to the radio.

59:57.480 --> 1:00:00.000
It was just coming up
to my favorite program,

1:00:00.000 --> 1:00:02.480
just before 9:00.

1:00:02.480 --> 1:00:04.960
So maybe 10 to 9:00?

1:00:10.720 --> 1:00:13.680
Rory would certainly
count as a first-aider.

1:00:13.680 --> 1:00:16.880
But Rory was on shift
at the hospital.

1:00:16.880 --> 1:00:19.400
James Green has short hair.

1:00:19.400 --> 1:00:22.840
A known blackmailer,
increasingly desperate,

1:00:22.840 --> 1:00:24.480
though the timing's
impossibly tight.

1:00:24.480 --> 1:00:26.680
Mm.

1:00:26.680 --> 1:00:29.160
Course, it might have just been
someone collecting for charity.

1:00:29.160 --> 1:00:32.280
That time of night?
And annoyed?

1:00:32.280 --> 1:00:34.000
Either way,

1:00:34.000 --> 1:00:38.520
this witness puts Oliver Cowie
still alive at 8:50,

1:00:38.520 --> 1:00:40.840
and we know he died
in the next hour.

1:00:40.840 --> 1:00:43.880
Let's make a list of sportswear
and leisure brands

1:00:43.880 --> 1:00:46.440
that use a plus-sign-type cross
as a logo.

1:00:46.440 --> 1:00:47.840
Sure.

1:00:47.840 --> 1:00:49.720
Just checked
with the hospital.

1:00:49.720 --> 1:00:52.200
Rory Fisk went to grab
a burger on his dinner break

1:00:52.200 --> 1:00:54.280
for two hours
and 20 minutes.

1:00:55.720 --> 1:00:57.680
Rory and Lyn?

1:00:57.680 --> 1:01:02.280
Two bereaved parents find love
after fleecing the deceased.

1:01:02.280 --> 1:01:04.040
I mean,
who would question it?

1:01:26.440 --> 1:01:29.400
I'm just off shift.
I was about to go home.

1:01:29.400 --> 1:01:31.960
Where were you
between 8:30 and 11:50

1:01:31.960 --> 1:01:33.680
on the night of the murder?

1:01:33.680 --> 1:01:37.040
Because we know you didn't
just nip out for a burger.

1:01:37.040 --> 1:01:39.200
I was with a friend.

1:01:39.200 --> 1:01:41.400
A girlfriend.

1:01:41.400 --> 1:01:43.560
Amy Lightfoot.
She's a nurse practitioner here.

1:01:43.560 --> 1:01:45.840
It's early days, but I didn't
want anyone to know,

1:01:45.840 --> 1:01:47.080
especially my daughter.

1:01:47.080 --> 1:01:49.480
Why on earth
didn't you tell us?

1:01:49.480 --> 1:01:51.360
Your friend's been murdered.

1:01:51.360 --> 1:01:52.800
Because it had nothing to do
with Oliver.

1:01:53.880 --> 1:01:56.080
Here Amy's contact details.

1:01:57.760 --> 1:02:01.680
Look, Petal's been blindsided
by her mother death,

1:02:01.680 --> 1:02:03.400
she's got important exams
coming up,

1:02:03.400 --> 1:02:05.520
and she's upset that
her best mate is going away.

1:02:05.520 --> 1:02:06.960
Now this nightmare?

1:02:06.960 --> 1:02:08.200
I really didn't think
it was a good time

1:02:08.200 --> 1:02:09.360
to throw another curve ball
at her,

1:02:09.360 --> 1:02:11.160
and it just wasn't relevant.

1:02:11.160 --> 1:02:12.880
You do realize we're gonna
have to check your whereabouts

1:02:12.880 --> 1:02:14.280
with Miss Lightfoot?

1:02:14.280 --> 1:02:15.920
Yeah, of course, but please,

1:02:15.920 --> 1:02:18.840
just don't say anything
to Petal.

1:02:18.840 --> 1:02:20.040
I don't think she can take that
right now.

1:02:37.920 --> 1:02:41.480
What better place to dispose of
bloody clothes than a hospital?

1:02:41.480 --> 1:02:44.760
Just put on a fresh pair
of scrubs, and bingo.

1:02:44.760 --> 1:02:46.520
Plus he's a cyclist.

1:02:46.520 --> 1:02:48.920
And did you notice
he was wearing a track suit?

1:02:48.920 --> 1:02:50.680
Max, I have four track suits.

1:02:50.680 --> 1:02:53.240
Scroll left
for what I've dug up.

1:02:53.240 --> 1:02:56.480
Nothing I can find that has
the logo on the back, though.

1:03:00.880 --> 1:03:04.400
What about an old design
or a club logo?

1:03:04.400 --> 1:03:06.440
I'll keep on it.

1:03:06.440 --> 1:03:09.200
Amy Lightfoot confirms
Rory Fisk's alibi.

1:03:09.200 --> 1:03:10.960
- Any evidence?
- Absolutely.

1:03:10.960 --> 1:03:13.240
She even took a selfie of them
at the flat.

1:03:13.240 --> 1:03:15.360
Time, date, coordinates, there.

1:04:29.640 --> 1:04:31.680
Oh, you idiot.

1:04:53.920 --> 1:04:56.840
- Max.
- Eric Heidegger's dad.

1:04:56.840 --> 1:05:01.280
He's something senior in
a German shipping firm, right?

1:05:01.280 --> 1:05:02.760
Go on.

1:05:02.760 --> 1:05:05.200
But that doesn't mean
he's German himself.

1:05:05.200 --> 1:05:08.000
He said his wife
was flying to Bern.

1:05:08.000 --> 1:05:10.200
Well, that's in Switzerland.

1:05:24.040 --> 1:05:26.640
I usually go jogging.

1:05:26.640 --> 1:05:29.680
I went to see him that evening.
I admit it.

1:05:29.680 --> 1:05:31.680
But I didn't even go
inside the house.

1:05:31.680 --> 1:05:33.560
I was out for a run.

1:05:33.560 --> 1:05:35.600
I had an important shipment
to coordinate that night,

1:05:35.600 --> 1:05:37.200
and I wanted to clear my head.

1:05:37.200 --> 1:05:39.200
You run
around there regularly?

1:05:39.200 --> 1:05:42.960
No, but I was upset and worried
about my son being suspended,

1:05:42.960 --> 1:05:47.240
so I decided to talk to Cowie
about it as fathers.

1:05:47.240 --> 1:05:49.680
To reason with him.

1:05:49.680 --> 1:05:52.520
I know where he lives. Eric used
to be friends with his daughter.

1:05:52.520 --> 1:05:53.960
Mm.

1:05:53.960 --> 1:05:55.440
Until Oliver Cowie found out

1:05:55.440 --> 1:05:57.120
Eric introduced her
to cocaine

1:05:57.120 --> 1:05:58.200
and banned him
from the house.

1:05:59.520 --> 1:06:01.040
Did you know about that?

1:06:01.040 --> 1:06:02.280
Yes, I knew.

1:06:02.280 --> 1:06:04.200
I knew that's what
Cowie thought.

1:06:09.440 --> 1:06:13.400
But it was Flo who bought
the cocaine, not Eric.

1:06:13.400 --> 1:06:15.000
You think I wouldn't know?

1:06:17.360 --> 1:06:19.200
And then a few days ago,

1:06:19.200 --> 1:06:23.080
Cowie accused Eric of obscene
graffiti which he didn't do.

1:06:23.080 --> 1:06:26.160
He was going to be excluded
in his final year.

1:06:26.160 --> 1:06:28.440
- And you were angry.
- Yes!

1:06:28.440 --> 1:06:31.240
I went for a run,
and then I went to see him.

1:06:31.240 --> 1:06:32.760
But I didn't kill him.
Why would I?

1:06:32.760 --> 1:06:34.480
You lost your temper.

1:06:34.480 --> 1:06:36.880
Eric's academic career
over like that,

1:06:36.880 --> 1:06:38.600
and this man wouldn't listen.

1:06:38.600 --> 1:06:40.200
To the contrary,
he did listen.

1:06:40.200 --> 1:06:43.280
He was really
very nice about it.

1:06:45.160 --> 1:06:47.400
Mr. Cowie said
he had reconsidered,

1:06:47.400 --> 1:06:50.200
and he would review
his case first thing.

1:06:50.200 --> 1:06:53.200
Okay.

1:06:53.200 --> 1:06:56.880
So you sorted it out nicely,
off you jogged,

1:06:56.880 --> 1:06:58.760
and then when you found out
he'd been killed,

1:06:58.760 --> 1:07:01.040
you didn't come forward
because...?

1:07:01.040 --> 1:07:04.640
I wanted to make things better,
not worse.

1:07:04.640 --> 1:07:07.240
My son was already
in trouble with cocaine.

1:07:07.240 --> 1:07:10.080
He has one chance
to get these exams.

1:07:12.240 --> 1:07:13.720
I know
I should have told you,

1:07:13.720 --> 1:07:16.880
but I didn't want
the association.

1:07:16.880 --> 1:07:19.360
I have my visa to think of.

1:07:19.360 --> 1:07:22.080
You must have known
you were a key witness.

1:07:22.080 --> 1:07:25.160
I didn't have anything useful
to tell you.

1:07:25.160 --> 1:07:27.760
Mr. Heidegger, you were
seen with the victim

1:07:27.760 --> 1:07:30.200
less than an hour
before he was murdered.

1:07:30.200 --> 1:07:32.480
We'll decide what's useful.

1:07:32.480 --> 1:07:36.200
Why would I kill the man who was
about to clear my son's name?

1:07:36.200 --> 1:07:38.200
Well, we only have your word
for that.

1:07:38.200 --> 1:07:40.400
I told you,
I was working that night.

1:07:40.400 --> 1:07:42.200
You can check.

1:07:42.200 --> 1:07:44.080
My colleagues would have
mentioned it

1:07:44.080 --> 1:07:45.800
if I came in covered in blood.

1:07:45.800 --> 1:07:47.280
So would the schoolkid

1:07:47.280 --> 1:07:49.240
who nearly knocked me over
on the corner.

1:07:49.240 --> 1:07:51.520
So would the guy
at the corner shop

1:07:51.520 --> 1:07:52.960
who I bought cigarettes from.

1:07:52.960 --> 1:07:55.680
- Check it, please.
- We will.

1:07:55.680 --> 1:07:57.040
Believe me.

1:08:01.480 --> 1:08:05.400
So, either someone visited
Cowie moments after Alex did --

1:08:05.400 --> 1:08:07.680
unexpected, unplanned,
and wasn't seen...

1:08:07.680 --> 1:08:09.480
Or he's lying.

1:08:09.480 --> 1:08:12.960
Let's check out the corner shop,
schoolkids out at that time.

1:08:12.960 --> 1:08:15.720
And let's follow up
on his comings and goings

1:08:15.720 --> 1:08:17.160
at Imperial Wharf.

1:08:17.160 --> 1:08:19.240
We've got authority
for a PACE house search.

1:08:19.240 --> 1:08:21.720
We don't need it.
He's invited us in.

1:08:21.720 --> 1:08:24.680
- Confident.
- Or calculated risk.

1:08:24.680 --> 1:08:27.280
The more he cooperates,
the less guilty he appears.

1:08:27.280 --> 1:08:29.280
He could hardly look
more guilty.

1:08:39.400 --> 1:08:42.600
It's been washed, but if there's
blood on it, we'll find it.

1:08:42.600 --> 1:08:44.840
Well, he may have had several, anyway.

1:08:44.840 --> 1:08:48.040
He doesn't.
Mum gave it to him.

1:08:49.440 --> 1:08:52.200
Your father gave us permission
to search.

1:08:52.200 --> 1:08:55.440
I know.
I called him.

1:08:55.440 --> 1:08:57.360
I wanted to tell him I lied.

1:08:59.200 --> 1:09:01.240
I wasn't here that night.

1:09:01.240 --> 1:09:03.440
I left
after Mum went to bed.

1:09:05.360 --> 1:09:08.440
- Can we talk somewhere else?
- Sure.

1:09:28.640 --> 1:09:31.240
I thought I was getting done
for tagging.

1:09:31.240 --> 1:09:34.200
I didn't say 'cause I thought
you'd do me for vandalism.

1:09:34.200 --> 1:09:35.400
Yeah.

1:09:35.400 --> 1:09:37.200
It's a shame people
keep blinding

1:09:37.200 --> 1:09:39.360
those security cameras,
else we'd check.

1:09:39.360 --> 1:09:40.920
I was with someone
who can back me up.

1:09:43.040 --> 1:09:44.840
Flo.

1:09:44.840 --> 1:09:47.240
She called me, wanted to
come out and help me tag.

1:09:47.240 --> 1:09:48.960
So she wasn't at Petal's?

1:09:48.960 --> 1:09:51.440
At first.

1:09:51.440 --> 1:09:53.840
Then Petal covered for us.

1:09:53.840 --> 1:09:57.880
We weren't supposed to see
each other after the coke thing.

1:09:57.880 --> 1:10:00.480
So what time did Flo
get to you?

1:10:00.480 --> 1:10:02.040
Maybe 10:00.

1:10:02.040 --> 1:10:04.960
She'd come with me before.

1:10:04.960 --> 1:10:07.080
It wasn't the art, really.

1:10:07.080 --> 1:10:09.920
She just liked
breaking the rules.

1:10:09.920 --> 1:10:12.840
What did you do after?

1:10:12.840 --> 1:10:15.040
Went back to Petal's.
She was asleep.

1:10:15.040 --> 1:10:16.280
Her dad was at work.

1:10:16.280 --> 1:10:18.760
I left later on,
like 3:30,

1:10:18.760 --> 1:10:20.240
snuck back in here.

1:10:20.240 --> 1:10:22.200
And what did you do
in between?

1:10:22.200 --> 1:10:24.520
What do you think?

1:10:30.680 --> 1:10:33.000
You think my dad did this,
right?

1:10:34.000 --> 1:10:36.440
There is no way.

1:10:36.440 --> 1:10:38.840
He's always talking to me
about honor and trust.

1:10:38.840 --> 1:10:41.520
I feel bad
even sneaking out.

1:10:41.520 --> 1:10:43.400
All I ever do
is let him down.

1:10:43.400 --> 1:10:47.800
I -- I thought maybe if I could
get into art school,

1:10:47.800 --> 1:10:49.680
he'd be pleased.

1:10:51.000 --> 1:10:53.440
- You're talented.
- Tell that to them.

1:10:56.480 --> 1:10:58.480
Doesn't matter how talented.

1:10:58.480 --> 1:11:00.200
I've still got to finish school
to get in.

1:11:00.200 --> 1:11:01.480
Oh!

1:11:03.680 --> 1:11:06.840
Then finish.

1:11:06.840 --> 1:11:09.240
Go back.
Knuckle down.

1:11:09.240 --> 1:11:12.080
Do your best.
Make it happen.

1:11:13.720 --> 1:11:14.760
Priya.

1:11:21.440 --> 1:11:23.600
The corner shop owner says
he gets dozens of joggers,

1:11:23.600 --> 1:11:26.480
but he thinks he recognizes
Heidegger's photo,

1:11:26.480 --> 1:11:28.120
and he recorded a cash sale

1:11:28.120 --> 1:11:30.760
for a packet of cigarettes
at 21:15

1:11:30.760 --> 1:11:32.680
just like Alex said.

1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:36.040
Got it.
See you there.

1:11:36.040 --> 1:11:37.440
Eric Heidegger's
phone records.

1:11:37.440 --> 1:11:39.040
On it.

1:11:51.840 --> 1:11:53.920
I told you
it was my fault.

1:11:53.920 --> 1:11:57.960
If I hadn't lied, if I'd stopped
being so selfish

1:11:57.960 --> 1:11:59.640
and just stayed at home...

1:11:59.640 --> 1:12:02.200
If you'd stayed at home,
you could have been hurt too.

1:12:02.200 --> 1:12:04.400
All you did
was go and see Eric.

1:12:04.400 --> 1:12:05.720
That's forgivable.

1:12:05.720 --> 1:12:07.960
I forgive you.
So would Dad.

1:12:09.120 --> 1:12:11.720
Would it be all right to have
a few moments alone with Flo?

1:12:20.200 --> 1:12:22.200
That's me off home now, Lyn.

1:12:22.200 --> 1:12:23.680
Thank you.

1:12:36.720 --> 1:12:41.360
Flo, we need to know the truth
about what happened that night.

1:12:41.360 --> 1:12:43.680
And I think you want
to tell someone.

1:12:45.280 --> 1:12:46.440
Uh...

1:12:47.920 --> 1:12:50.760
I went to Petal's.

1:12:50.760 --> 1:12:54.000
And I was already so angry
at Dad anyway.

1:12:58.200 --> 1:13:00.000
We know from Eric's
phone records

1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:02.960
that you called him at 8:45,

1:13:02.960 --> 1:13:05.760
but you didn't get
to the bridge until 10:00.

1:13:05.760 --> 1:13:08.960
So, what time
did you leave Petal's, Flo?

1:13:10.760 --> 1:13:15.200
I can ask her,
but I'd rather you told me.

1:13:15.200 --> 1:13:19.400
I left Petal's right after
I called Eric,

1:13:19.400 --> 1:13:22.920
and he told me Dad was having
him kicked him out of school.

1:13:22.920 --> 1:13:25.480
So I went
and scored some coke

1:13:25.480 --> 1:13:27.720
from the guy
I got it from before.

1:13:29.400 --> 1:13:31.720
I just wanted to punish Dad.

1:13:31.720 --> 1:13:33.720
I wanted to hurt him.

1:13:38.000 --> 1:13:39.320
Okay.

1:13:40.840 --> 1:13:42.680
So, who did you get
the coke from?

1:13:42.680 --> 1:13:44.240
Where did you go?

1:13:44.240 --> 1:13:46.200
Please don't make me grass.

1:13:46.200 --> 1:13:48.440
We'll be discreet.

1:13:48.440 --> 1:13:50.200
We just need to know
what time you were there.

1:13:50.200 --> 1:13:52.720
He's in the year above me.

1:13:52.720 --> 1:13:56.200
It's just like
by word of mouth.

1:13:56.200 --> 1:13:57.920
I'm gonna need his name
and number, okay?

1:13:57.920 --> 1:14:01.200
Did you take him
to your home, Flo?

1:14:01.200 --> 1:14:02.640
I don't even know him.

1:14:02.640 --> 1:14:06.000
Did you take anyone
to your home?

1:14:06.000 --> 1:14:08.200
Or send someone
to punish your dad?

1:14:08.200 --> 1:14:09.720
No. No!

1:14:09.720 --> 1:14:13.200
I -- I just --
I went to meet Eric,

1:14:13.200 --> 1:14:16.280
and then we went back
to Petal's.

1:14:16.280 --> 1:14:17.800
I loved my dad.

1:14:19.040 --> 1:14:21.480
Course I did.

1:14:21.480 --> 1:14:24.360
I just wanted to get away
from all the aggravation,

1:14:24.360 --> 1:14:26.280
all the fighting.

1:14:26.280 --> 1:14:29.600
It never used to be
like that at home.

1:14:29.600 --> 1:14:32.440
Even Carmel had a bust-up
with Dad over something.

1:14:34.920 --> 1:14:37.800
It was like a war zone.

1:14:37.800 --> 1:14:40.680
All 'cause of Japan.

1:14:40.680 --> 1:14:42.840
And I blamed Dad.

1:14:45.400 --> 1:14:48.400
I always thought I'd know
if my kid was doing drugs.

1:14:49.880 --> 1:14:52.400
Well, we'll check out
the dealer, close him down.

1:14:52.400 --> 1:14:56.360
But she seems to be carrying
a lot of guilt.

1:14:56.360 --> 1:14:59.720
She wanted to go to Petal's
this afternoon.

1:14:59.720 --> 1:15:03.320
I was going to say no,
but maybe she needs her friend.

1:15:08.240 --> 1:15:10.200
Carmel cycle to work?

1:15:10.200 --> 1:15:13.000
Sometimes.
If the weather's okay.

1:15:14.960 --> 1:15:16.520
Carmel?

1:15:21.960 --> 1:15:23.640
I was at home,
like I've told you,

1:15:23.640 --> 1:15:24.880
watching telly.

1:15:24.880 --> 1:15:26.120
What did you watch?

1:15:26.120 --> 1:15:28.880
That vet thing
with Mr. Charisma.

1:15:28.880 --> 1:15:31.480
I tape them.

1:15:31.480 --> 1:15:33.960
Isn't there some box that
proves what you've seen?

1:15:33.960 --> 1:15:37.040
Your phone would be helpful,
if you wouldn't mind.

1:15:45.840 --> 1:15:47.760
And if you could
unlock it, please.

1:16:04.720 --> 1:16:07.000
What did you and Oliver Cowie
row about

1:16:07.000 --> 1:16:08.640
a few nights ago,
Carmel?

1:16:08.640 --> 1:16:11.480
I-I-I don't...

1:16:11.480 --> 1:16:13.800
Nothing.

1:16:13.800 --> 1:16:16.920
You're here voluntarily,

1:16:16.920 --> 1:16:20.000
but we could detain you
if need be.

1:16:20.000 --> 1:16:23.600
I wanted to go with them
to Japan.

1:16:23.600 --> 1:16:27.200
Well, they'd want a cleaner
in Tokyo, wouldn't they?

1:16:27.200 --> 1:16:28.840
But Oliver said no.

1:16:28.840 --> 1:16:31.960
It was too complicated
with visas and whatnot.

1:16:31.960 --> 1:16:35.920
And they didn't need as much
now Flo's older, he said.

1:16:35.920 --> 1:16:38.720
I lost my temper, briefly.

1:16:38.720 --> 1:16:41.680
But he was right, of course.

1:16:41.680 --> 1:16:43.120
And he said
he'd spread the word

1:16:43.120 --> 1:16:45.640
about another client
for me, so...

1:16:45.640 --> 1:16:48.040
And how did that make you feel?

1:16:48.040 --> 1:16:51.520
Honestly?
I was hurt.

1:16:51.520 --> 1:16:52.840
I've no kids of me own,

1:16:52.840 --> 1:16:54.840
and they'd told me time
and again

1:16:54.840 --> 1:16:55.840
I was part of the family.

1:16:56.800 --> 1:16:59.080
I felt used, I suppose.

1:17:00.040 --> 1:17:01.560
Abandoned.

1:17:03.200 --> 1:17:04.240
Disposable.

1:17:08.640 --> 1:17:11.960
Yes, I was very upset.

1:17:11.960 --> 1:17:15.400
But I didn't kill Oliver, if
that's what you're getting at.

1:17:15.400 --> 1:17:18.840
Might be a lonely cow,
but I'm not a murderer,

1:17:18.840 --> 1:17:20.000
thank you very much.

1:17:20.000 --> 1:17:22.680
I'll see this is returned
to you.

1:17:42.920 --> 1:17:44.600
Her phone
places her at home.

1:17:44.600 --> 1:17:46.400
Assuming she was with it.

1:17:46.400 --> 1:17:48.120
Hmm.

1:17:48.120 --> 1:17:50.480
Right, let's go over
what we've got.

1:17:50.480 --> 1:17:54.120
We know Heidegger called
on Cowie at 20:50.

1:17:54.120 --> 1:17:55.920
Either he went in
and killed him,

1:17:55.920 --> 1:17:57.720
or he left and someone else,
on a bike,

1:17:57.720 --> 1:17:59.160
came shortly afterwards.

1:17:59.160 --> 1:18:01.760
Carmel rides a bicycle,
she has a grudge,

1:18:01.760 --> 1:18:04.200
and she is a key holder.

1:18:04.200 --> 1:18:06.440
But she'd have cycled
all the way back to Battersea

1:18:06.440 --> 1:18:08.400
covered in blood,

1:18:08.400 --> 1:18:11.600
then turned up cool as you like
at the scene the next day.

1:18:11.600 --> 1:18:13.000
Would she have a choice?

1:18:13.000 --> 1:18:14.200
Heidegger was definitely back

1:18:14.200 --> 1:18:16.200
at his Imperial Wharf office,
21:15.

1:18:16.200 --> 1:18:17.720
Nothing unusual.

1:18:17.720 --> 1:18:20.400
What about the schoolkid
he said he bumped into?

1:18:20.400 --> 1:18:21.880
That could be anyone.

1:18:21.880 --> 1:18:24.480
Fernlea Close covers
three catchment areas.

1:18:24.480 --> 1:18:25.920
But do we need it, Max?

1:18:25.920 --> 1:18:28.120
If we can place him
in the corner shop,

1:18:28.120 --> 1:18:30.120
Alex Heidegger
couldn't have done it.

1:18:30.120 --> 1:18:31.240
The owner said
he wasn't sure.

1:18:33.120 --> 1:18:34.920
What about
the first graffiti?

1:18:34.920 --> 1:18:37.640
Did we get anything back from
the witness who saw Eric do it?

1:18:37.640 --> 1:18:39.280
I'll chase it now.

1:18:42.760 --> 1:18:44.560
Something's missing.

1:18:57.240 --> 1:18:59.720
Shall I tell Heidegger
he can go?

1:19:01.880 --> 1:19:02.920
Max?

1:19:05.760 --> 1:19:07.720
Her alibi.

1:19:11.520 --> 1:19:14.040
Oh, my God.

1:19:24.960 --> 1:19:27.120
This schoolkid you say
you bumped into

1:19:27.120 --> 1:19:29.840
after leaving Cowie's place --
Was it a girl or a boy?

1:19:29.840 --> 1:19:32.960
A girl.
She nearly came off her bicycle.

1:19:32.960 --> 1:19:34.640
Let him go.

1:19:34.640 --> 1:19:36.480
The pupil, the witness
who grassed up Eric...

1:19:36.480 --> 1:19:37.440
I know who she is.

1:19:51.760 --> 1:19:53.880
I'm working, Flo.

1:19:53.880 --> 1:19:56.240
- Can't you take a break?
- No.

1:19:56.240 --> 1:19:58.720
You won't pass your exams
if you don't finish your essay.

1:19:58.720 --> 1:20:01.120
Exams can wait.

1:20:03.640 --> 1:20:05.240
I need you.

1:20:12.240 --> 1:20:13.720
What is it?

1:20:13.720 --> 1:20:15.960
You need to let us in, Rory.

1:20:15.960 --> 1:20:18.160
Can't we go out?

1:20:18.160 --> 1:20:20.680
Just go somewhere.
For a walk?

1:20:20.680 --> 1:20:21.560
I need to concentrate.

1:20:21.560 --> 1:20:23.280
Petal!

1:20:23.280 --> 1:20:26.440
Seriously, get changed.

1:20:26.440 --> 1:20:28.440
Where are the girls?

1:20:28.440 --> 1:20:31.000
I can't do this.
I'm sorry.

1:20:31.000 --> 1:20:34.760
I'm the one
who needs help.

1:20:34.760 --> 1:20:37.640
I'm the one whose having
a breakdown.

1:20:37.640 --> 1:20:40.000
We need you to stay here.

1:20:41.200 --> 1:20:42.800
We're going to go out.

1:20:46.200 --> 1:20:47.280
And you're going to get...

1:20:59.920 --> 1:21:01.720
I didn't mean it.

1:21:08.760 --> 1:21:10.320
It's okay to tell her.

1:21:12.600 --> 1:21:17.280
You were off out with Eric,
doing drugs, ruining everything.

1:21:20.720 --> 1:21:23.520
So you were trying
to help your friend.

1:21:23.520 --> 1:21:25.200
Was that what it was,
Petal?

1:21:25.200 --> 1:21:28.880
I thought
if her dad understood,

1:21:28.880 --> 1:21:30.680
if he knew what I knew,

1:21:30.680 --> 1:21:33.200
he'd catch her
before she fell too far.

1:21:33.200 --> 1:21:35.440
So you didn't go there
to hurt him?

1:21:35.440 --> 1:21:38.480
I went to warn him,

1:21:38.480 --> 1:21:42.240
how messed up
Flo was getting.

1:21:42.240 --> 1:21:44.480
And maybe...

1:21:45.640 --> 1:21:47.880
he'd even let her stay?

1:21:47.880 --> 1:21:51.360
But he was angry with me.

1:21:51.360 --> 1:21:52.840
For making stuff up
about Eric.

1:21:52.840 --> 1:21:56.040
But I was only trying
to protect you, Flo.

1:21:59.640 --> 1:22:02.400
He said he was disappointed
in me,

1:22:02.400 --> 1:22:07.440
that I needed to --
to back off, to go home.

1:22:09.280 --> 1:22:11.280
Never heard him talk to me
like that.

1:22:11.280 --> 1:22:15.160
That must have been
very painful.

1:22:15.160 --> 1:22:18.880
He said she wasn't
my responsibility

1:22:18.880 --> 1:22:21.440
and that I wasn't...

1:22:23.240 --> 1:22:25.200
...that we weren't...

1:22:26.520 --> 1:22:28.040
...family.

1:22:32.440 --> 1:22:36.800
Like all my caring
was for nothing again.

1:22:40.200 --> 1:22:41.520
...and I'm alone.

1:22:46.200 --> 1:22:48.280
I'm nothing.

1:22:48.280 --> 1:22:50.200
Abandoned.

1:22:50.200 --> 1:22:52.240
Disposable.

1:22:57.520 --> 1:23:01.000
He went to reach for his phone
to call my dad.

1:23:01.000 --> 1:23:03.120
I just wanted to stop him.

1:23:12.760 --> 1:23:15.000
I'll call
the duty social worker.

1:24:01.320 --> 1:24:03.480
How does a kid survive
something like this,

1:24:03.480 --> 1:24:05.200
either Petal or Flo?

1:24:05.200 --> 1:24:07.600
A good therapist,
for starters.

1:24:07.600 --> 1:24:09.520
It's a long road
to forgiveness,

1:24:09.520 --> 1:24:12.200
but we have to hope
that's possible.

1:24:12.200 --> 1:24:14.520
Uh, I just need
to make a call.

1:24:25.240 --> 1:24:27.080
Astrid, it's me.

1:24:28.720 --> 1:24:33.640
Look, I'm sorry
about the other day.

1:24:33.640 --> 1:24:35.200
Can we talk?

1:24:37.800 --> 1:24:39.040
Great.

1:24:41.200 --> 1:24:43.400
8:00.

1:24:43.400 --> 1:24:47.720
And listen, there's a favor
I need to ask you.

1:24:58.160 --> 1:25:00.320
Mr. Heidegger?
I'm Astrid.

1:25:00.320 --> 1:25:02.960
Detective Inspector
Max Arnold's friend.

1:25:02.960 --> 1:25:04.720
D.I. Arnold left a message.

1:25:04.720 --> 1:25:08.760
Um, he said you have
connections at the art college

1:25:08.760 --> 1:25:10.240
my son wants to go to.

1:25:10.240 --> 1:25:13.480
I can certainly offer your son
some advice,

1:25:13.480 --> 1:25:16.000
maybe get through the door
for an interview.

1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:19.520
It's very kind of you
to spare the time. Please.

1:25:27.640 --> 1:25:29.400
I'm off home
if that's okay.

1:25:29.400 --> 1:25:32.560
Yeah.
Sick of the sight of you.

1:25:34.200 --> 1:25:35.920
Don't stay too long,
okay?

1:25:35.920 --> 1:25:38.520
No, I'm gone. As soon as
I've finished my paperwork.

1:25:40.520 --> 1:25:42.520
Right.

1:25:42.520 --> 1:25:44.960
Good night, guys.
Good night.

1:25:57.880 --> 1:25:59.840
She went down fine.

1:26:01.240 --> 1:26:02.760
You've got the magic touch.

1:26:02.760 --> 1:26:05.080
Oh, please.

1:26:05.080 --> 1:26:06.760
But I'm working on it, babe.

1:26:11.400 --> 1:26:14.400
I know you do a lot.
Too much.

1:26:14.400 --> 1:26:15.760
And I'm sorry.

1:26:15.760 --> 1:26:17.200
Hey.

1:26:17.200 --> 1:26:20.240
It's what
I signed up for.

1:26:21.640 --> 1:26:25.240
So, what's for dinner,
Nigella?

1:26:25.240 --> 1:26:27.720
Oh, well, tonight

1:26:27.720 --> 1:26:30.400
you have the choice
of pasta pesto

1:26:30.400 --> 1:26:34.200
or something
I like to call pesto pasta.

1:26:34.200 --> 1:26:37.520
I'm feeling the pasta pesto.

1:26:37.520 --> 1:26:39.440
Mmm!

1:26:39.440 --> 1:26:40.760
Good choice.

1:26:42.560 --> 1:26:43.920
Can you cook it?

1:26:47.520 --> 1:26:50.520
- You're early.
- You're late.

1:26:50.520 --> 1:26:53.200
I stopped to see
your budding Banksy earlier.

1:26:53.200 --> 1:26:54.640
I like him.

1:26:54.640 --> 1:26:58.160
Thanks, Asti.
I know how busy you are.

1:26:58.160 --> 1:27:01.040
Not too busy for the posh dinner
you promised me in return.

1:27:01.040 --> 1:27:03.240
Kebabs okay?

1:27:03.240 --> 1:27:05.280
Do I have a choice?

1:27:05.280 --> 1:27:06.560
Oh, yeah.

1:27:06.560 --> 1:27:09.040
Lamb or falafel.

1:27:12.200 --> 1:27:16.840
Just so you know, I've signed
a license on the boat.

1:27:16.840 --> 1:27:19.040
A year,
with an option to renew.

1:27:21.000 --> 1:27:25.960
And I've officially
changed my address.

1:27:25.960 --> 1:27:28.720
You were right.
It's time to move on.

1:27:31.480 --> 1:27:35.000
So we have something
to toast.

1:27:41.920 --> 1:27:44.520
I'll be right in.
