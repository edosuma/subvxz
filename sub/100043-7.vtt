WEBVTT

00:03.754 --> 00:04.838
Honey, what are you doing?

00:04.922 --> 00:06.882
I just saw this incredible
telekinesis video.

00:06.882 --> 00:08.842
I'm trying to make
a piece of bacon levitate.

00:08.926 --> 00:10.802
Don't you have to, I don't know, work?

00:10.886 --> 00:12.721
Are you saying it'll never happen?

00:12.721 --> 00:15.641
Is there perhaps a more
colorful way of saying that?

00:15.641 --> 00:18.477
I know you're trying to get me to say,
"It'll happen when pigs fly."

00:18.477 --> 00:20.270
That counts!

00:20.354 --> 00:22.022
What?

00:22.397 --> 00:23.690
Oh, my God.

00:23.774 --> 00:25.150
Morning, Earth mates!

00:25.234 --> 00:26.610
Morning, Farrah... Huh.

00:26.610 --> 00:28.487
Oh, my lower back is killing me.

00:29.238 --> 00:31.240
Has anyone seen my healing crystal?

00:31.573 --> 00:34.326
Mmm. That may be the only things
of yours we haven't seen.

00:34.326 --> 00:35.953
Dylan's mom, Farrah,

00:35.953 --> 00:38.080
came to see the babies
and then she found out

00:38.080 --> 00:41.917
that her polyamorous quad
was downgraded to a triad.

00:41.917 --> 00:43.293
Now we're stuck with her.

00:43.377 --> 00:45.671
Polyamory... Can you imagine?

00:45.671 --> 00:46.797
No.

00:48.924 --> 00:50.008
She needs to go.

01:07.568 --> 01:10.404
Farrah! Farrah! Farrah!

01:10.404 --> 01:12.489
Do you have to do that right here?

01:12.781 --> 01:14.074
Oh, I am so sorry,

01:14.074 --> 01:17.202
I didn't realize you wanted
it to keep flooding in the Philippines.

01:17.286 --> 01:19.830
I don't want it to keep flooding
in the Philippines, Claire.

01:19.830 --> 01:21.665
It's okay, I'll just go in the other room.

01:21.665 --> 01:23.250
Great.

01:24.334 --> 01:25.377
Ugh.

01:25.377 --> 01:27.087
It's Jerry. I can't.

01:27.171 --> 01:29.840
It's going to be 45 minutes
about how much he misses Mom

01:29.840 --> 01:32.092
and then some overshare
about their sex life.

01:32.176 --> 01:34.178
Claire, he's family.

01:35.012 --> 01:37.514
Jerry! How are you?

01:37.890 --> 01:40.475
Yeah. No, I know, we miss her, too.

01:40.893 --> 01:43.353
The babies? They're great.
Yeah, constantly exploring,

01:43.437 --> 01:44.646
always sticking
their fingers in everything.

01:48.066 --> 01:51.945
Oh, whoa, yeah,
what a fun image of my late mother-in-law.

01:52.905 --> 01:56.158
Really? Let me just
check to see if we're gonna be around.

01:57.326 --> 01:59.745
Jerry is following
the butterfly migration to Mexico

01:59.745 --> 02:01.788
and wants to stop by tomorrow to say hi.

02:01.872 --> 02:03.373
No way. Make up an excuse.

02:03.457 --> 02:05.584
- I'm a terrible liar.
- Tough.

02:05.792 --> 02:07.002
The last thing we need around here

02:07.002 --> 02:08.670
is another hippie kook.

02:09.046 --> 02:11.048
Oh, it finally happened, I'm my father.

02:12.007 --> 02:15.093
Oh, my goddesses, there you are.

02:15.761 --> 02:19.515
Oh, Claire, would you be comfortable
rubbing this just above my buttocks

02:19.515 --> 02:21.850
while I offer up a Tibetan pain chant?

02:22.142 --> 02:23.519
Doesn't sound like me,

02:23.519 --> 02:27.648
but I might know someone
who could help you out.

02:28.190 --> 02:31.443
Honestly, Jerry, it's that, uh...

02:31.902 --> 02:33.695
Claire and I have hit a rough patch.

02:33.779 --> 02:36.907
She's been huffing cans of whipped cream.

02:37.282 --> 02:38.408
I mean...

02:38.659 --> 02:39.785
Help me.

02:39.785 --> 02:43.163
Underneath our bed looks
like backstage at a pie-eating contest.

02:43.330 --> 02:45.082
- Invite him here.
- What?

02:45.082 --> 02:46.625
Just get him here as fast as you can.
Come on.

02:47.042 --> 02:48.544
Uh, actually, Jerry, everything's fine.

02:48.544 --> 02:50.671
Claire just agreed to seek help.
See you tomorrow.

02:50.671 --> 02:51.839
What the hell was that?

02:51.964 --> 02:54.925
Jerry's lonely. Farrah's lonely.
They both glom onto us.

02:54.925 --> 02:57.219
We set them up,
they'll glom onto each other,

02:57.219 --> 02:58.679
and then she can bang his drum.

02:58.679 --> 03:00.097
My beautiful genius.

03:00.472 --> 03:01.807
Oh! Sorry, hold on.

03:01.932 --> 03:04.268
Ooh...

03:05.936 --> 03:08.230
Now, I just have to find
someone to set you up with.

03:08.605 --> 03:10.232
Breaking out the good stuff, huh?

03:10.232 --> 03:11.608
Well, you know what, we're finally

03:11.692 --> 03:13.277
close friends with a lesbian couple.

03:13.277 --> 03:17.573
And I want them to feel as special
to us as if they were real gays.

03:17.573 --> 03:19.199
Cam, they're just as gay as we are.

03:19.283 --> 03:20.534
Okay, hold on. One more.

03:20.534 --> 03:21.869
Well, as I am.

03:22.870 --> 03:24.162
Okay.

03:24.955 --> 03:25.956
Hi.

03:26.248 --> 03:28.542
Oh, my gosh,
you guys are such a cute family.

03:28.542 --> 03:31.086
Oh, gosh, that picture,
that was taken at an amusement park.

03:31.170 --> 03:32.671
That's not the real Bigfoot.

03:32.671 --> 03:34.840
"The real Bigfoot."
Oh, my God, you're so funny.

03:34.840 --> 03:37.217
Yeah, sure. Okay,
let's go with, "He was making a joke."

03:37.342 --> 03:39.553
So, you guys, speaking of families...

03:39.553 --> 03:41.221
We're thinking about
starting one of our own.

03:41.305 --> 03:42.723
- Amazing!
- Congratulations!

03:42.723 --> 03:44.600
Oh! How are you going to do it?
What's the plan?

03:44.600 --> 03:46.768
Actually, we wanted
to ask you something about that.

03:47.394 --> 03:49.521
There comes a point
in every gay man's life

03:49.605 --> 03:52.399
when a lesbian couple
asks him for his sperm.

03:52.399 --> 03:54.067
- Unless you're Mitchell and me.
- Yeah.

03:54.151 --> 03:57.821
All our friends have been asked,
while we have been cruelly overlooked.

03:57.905 --> 04:00.490
It's painful, it's like not
getting picked to play kickball.

04:00.574 --> 04:04.745
Well, that never happened to me.
I was my kickball team's captain...

04:04.745 --> 04:08.040
Well, only after our star broke
his leg and had to be put down.

04:08.707 --> 04:10.042
- He was...
- A mule.

04:10.834 --> 04:11.960
From a mile away.

04:12.252 --> 04:13.795
Go ahead, ask us anything.

04:13.879 --> 04:15.839
Well, you know we think
the world of you guys.

04:15.923 --> 04:17.382
- Yes...
- And we you.

04:17.508 --> 04:20.886
First of all, would you judge us
if we didn't adopt? Is that selfish?

04:20.886 --> 04:22.387
- Um, no.
- No.

04:22.763 --> 04:23.972
Such a relief.

04:24.056 --> 04:27.184
Now, the next step
is finding someone who can...

04:27.309 --> 04:29.061
- Donate?
- Yes.

04:29.061 --> 04:31.772
You know, we don't want
anyone involved financially or otherwise.

04:31.772 --> 04:33.690
So we were just thinking
of going to the sperm bank.

04:33.941 --> 04:36.401
That's a good option but make
sure the janitors are handsome,

04:36.485 --> 04:38.195
because, you know,
they have the keys to everything.

04:38.320 --> 04:40.489
Well, we also thought about
asking my brother.

04:40.489 --> 04:43.158
Oh, you don't want to go down that road.
It's too complicated.

04:43.242 --> 04:46.286
My daddy, my uncle,
my daddy, my uncle. It's <i>Chinatown.</i>

04:46.411 --> 04:48.705
Yeah, you want someone
with a little distance,

04:48.789 --> 04:50.082
that you know and trust.

04:50.082 --> 04:51.917
Who's attractive and healthy...

04:51.917 --> 04:53.752
And who hasn't had mental
illness in their family

04:53.836 --> 04:55.879
in at least a generation and a half.

04:55.963 --> 04:57.631
Well, that's the dream.

04:57.631 --> 04:59.591
- Well, dreams can come true.
- Mmm-hmm.

04:59.675 --> 05:01.510
Oh, my God, thank you, guys!

05:01.677 --> 05:03.178
Oh! Thank you.

05:03.262 --> 05:04.638
If you think of someone,

05:04.638 --> 05:05.848
- will you let us know?
- Yeah.

05:08.225 --> 05:09.351
Lesbians.

05:10.018 --> 05:11.436
Here's your cappuccino. Ah.

05:11.520 --> 05:12.604
None for me.

05:12.688 --> 05:14.982
I don't need to be sharp
to experience the empty void

05:14.982 --> 05:17.109
that is life without Sherry Shaker.

05:17.109 --> 05:19.319
What are these
little drawings in the milk?

05:19.444 --> 05:21.113
That's me staring out a window.

05:21.238 --> 05:22.865
I made the stars with my tears.

05:23.198 --> 05:26.368
<i>Papi,</i> if you can survive
me driving three blocks

05:26.368 --> 05:29.121
with you on the roof of my car,
you can survive this.

05:29.329 --> 05:30.414
When did that happen?

05:30.414 --> 05:32.499
It wasn't gonna work out
with Sherry, anyway.

05:32.583 --> 05:35.127
She's Canadian.
They have ducks on their money,

05:35.127 --> 05:36.670
they sell milk in a bag.

05:36.920 --> 05:38.922
I'll be in my room if anyone needs me.

05:39.756 --> 05:41.800
Who am I kidding? No one needs me.

05:41.884 --> 05:46.180
All right, <i>Papi,</i> these things
have a way of working out. I promise.

05:46.180 --> 05:48.807
You promise? What did you do?

05:48.932 --> 05:50.309
I called in a favor.

05:52.269 --> 05:55.147
- Luke!
- Again? I thought we were even.

05:55.439 --> 05:57.107
I need you to do something for Manny.

05:57.191 --> 05:58.358
It'll mean the world to him.

05:58.442 --> 05:59.484
Okay, I guess.

05:59.568 --> 06:02.988
I want you to go to Sherry's
improv show and talk him up to her.

06:02.988 --> 06:05.073
I want her to regret breaking up with him.

06:05.157 --> 06:06.366
No. Not that.

06:06.450 --> 06:07.951
Anything but improv.

06:08.076 --> 06:10.204
Improv is no different than
getting waterboarded.

06:10.204 --> 06:13.248
Just stay calm,
go to a pleasant place in your mind,

06:13.332 --> 06:15.334
and remember
that you're not actually dying.

06:15.501 --> 06:16.919
Fine, I'll do it.

06:17.294 --> 06:18.337
Good boy.

06:19.713 --> 06:20.714
Go back to sleep.

06:20.839 --> 06:22.174
Why'd you bring a crowbar?

06:22.549 --> 06:23.592
No reason.

06:24.301 --> 06:25.969
Gloria, we should not be involved.

06:26.053 --> 06:29.473
You know what my dad
always said to me every time I was down?

06:29.640 --> 06:32.392
Nothing. I learned to figure
everything out on my own.

06:32.601 --> 06:34.978
This is your least attractive quality.

06:35.062 --> 06:36.438
Where is your empathy?

06:36.563 --> 06:37.814
I have empathy.

06:38.065 --> 06:40.108
That's the one where you care
about people, right?

06:40.275 --> 06:42.861
You don't go out of your way for anyone.

06:43.195 --> 06:44.738
Yes, I do.

06:44.947 --> 06:46.907
You remember that little
valet at the club?

06:46.907 --> 06:50.911
If I hadn't gotten him fired,
he'd still be moving everybody's seats up.

06:51.370 --> 06:53.247
Okay, here we go.

06:53.247 --> 06:56.708
Some apricot jam
from an old family recipe.

06:56.792 --> 06:59.503
Not that you would be
interested in any of my family recipes.

06:59.670 --> 07:00.754
Is everything okay?

07:00.838 --> 07:02.589
- Eh, eh!
- Why don't you want us to be your donor?

07:02.756 --> 07:04.716
Oh!
It's okay, just say it!

07:04.842 --> 07:05.884
You're put off by my red hair.

07:05.968 --> 07:07.678
- Or is it his freckles?
- Or my tendency to burn.

07:07.678 --> 07:09.221
- Or is it his...
- Can this one please be about you?

07:09.221 --> 07:10.347
- Yeah, yeah.
- Wait. Are you saying

07:10.347 --> 07:11.557
you would donate for us?

07:11.557 --> 07:15.102
Honestly, we would love that,
but we were afraid to put you on the spot,

07:15.102 --> 07:16.562
and we didn't think you'd say yes.

07:16.562 --> 07:19.022
- Well, of course, we'd say yes!
- We adore you.

07:19.106 --> 07:20.274
Oh, Molly,

07:20.274 --> 07:21.441
I think we just found our daddy.

07:22.985 --> 07:25.404
Okay, so which one of us do you want?

07:25.404 --> 07:27.322
I don't know. We haven't even
had a chance to think about it.

07:27.406 --> 07:28.490
- Yeah.
- Well, would it be helpful

07:28.574 --> 07:29.741
if we you know, walked around?

07:29.825 --> 07:32.703
So you could take us in
from shoulder to shank.

07:32.703 --> 07:33.871
It's not the county fair.

07:34.121 --> 07:35.581
All right, well,
maybe we'll just go outside

07:35.706 --> 07:37.374
and I don't know, kick something?

07:37.374 --> 07:40.210
Or we could do a puzzle?
Or we could spell Connecticut?

07:40.294 --> 07:42.921
Why don't you guys just decide?
We're happy either way.

07:43.130 --> 07:44.298
Shouldn't be a problem.

07:49.761 --> 07:52.890
Oh, good, you're both here.
Listen, I was thinking about yesterday.

07:52.890 --> 07:53.974
How upset you are

07:53.974 --> 07:55.976
and how you say I don't care
about other people's feelings.

07:55.976 --> 07:58.729
So, check this out. Brandi, get in here.

07:58.729 --> 08:00.439
I'm not done with my cigarette.

08:00.564 --> 08:01.648
What did you do?

08:01.773 --> 08:04.109
I was trying to figure out
a way to help Manny to move on,

08:04.193 --> 08:05.903
and all of a sudden,
I met this little angel.

08:05.903 --> 08:07.070
Brandi!

08:07.154 --> 08:10.032
Hold on,
the best part's right at the filter.

08:10.032 --> 08:12.910
You're gonna love her.
She runs towels at the car wash.

08:12.910 --> 08:14.161
Why did you encourage this?

08:14.161 --> 08:16.997
Hey, now, why settle for Sherry
when you can have a little Brandi?

08:17.206 --> 08:18.415
I'll admit that's good.

08:20.042 --> 08:22.377
Holy...

08:22.461 --> 08:24.296
This house.

08:24.838 --> 08:27.341
So, this is how come
you can afford the lava wax.

08:27.341 --> 08:31.094
Brandi, this is my wife, Gloria.
And this stud is my son, Manny.

08:31.178 --> 08:32.971
Brandi, I'm sure you're very nice,

08:33.055 --> 08:35.724
but I'm dealing with
losing the love of my life,

08:35.724 --> 08:37.684
and I just need some time.

08:38.477 --> 08:40.103
I know what you're going through, honey.

08:40.270 --> 08:43.899
My man saw <i>Free Solo,</i>
and tried to scale the local bank.

08:43.899 --> 08:47.694
He died doing what he loved,
daring the cops to shoot him.

08:47.819 --> 08:50.614
Jay, should I scream at you here
or should we do it in the kitchen?

08:50.739 --> 08:52.032
I could go for a little snack.

08:52.032 --> 08:53.659
Now, listen,
you guys get to know each other.

08:53.659 --> 08:55.118
Manny, offer her a drink at the bar.

08:55.202 --> 08:57.913
You got anything with cinnamon?
I'm not particular.

08:58.539 --> 09:01.375
What were you thinking,
bringing a girl like that here?

09:01.500 --> 09:03.544
What are you talking about?
Brandi's a ton of fun.

09:03.669 --> 09:05.796
Oh, sure, maybe you don't
bring her home to Mom...

09:05.796 --> 09:07.840
That's literally what you did.

09:07.840 --> 09:10.217
I hope that that's her parole officer.

09:13.762 --> 09:17.391
Ah... Luke, what a surprise!

09:18.559 --> 09:20.060
How did your talk with Sherry go?

09:20.060 --> 09:21.436
Not well.

09:21.520 --> 09:23.564
What do you mean?
Did you mention to her

09:23.564 --> 09:26.233
that Manny was retweeted
by one of the Property Brothers?

09:26.233 --> 09:28.485
- Yeah, I brought that up.
- And what did she say?

09:28.610 --> 09:31.113
Uh, does she miss him?
Will she take him back?

09:31.238 --> 09:32.447
I don't think so.

09:32.614 --> 09:35.117
- Why not?
- Well, we kind of...

09:35.868 --> 09:36.910
...kissed.

09:37.828 --> 09:38.996
What?

09:39.246 --> 09:42.291
The Brandi plan's looking
pretty good right now, huh?

09:43.834 --> 09:45.836
Hello, family!

09:46.086 --> 09:48.547
Hi, Jerry! Welcome, how are you?

09:48.547 --> 09:50.924
I'm sorry, I would've knocked,
but you know I abhor violence.

09:51.008 --> 09:52.342
Hey. Oh...

09:52.426 --> 09:55.137
Sorry, I was grinding polenta
for our lunch and my arm's kind of tender.

09:55.262 --> 09:56.597
Polenta elbow is a real thing.

09:56.597 --> 09:59.766
Marianne Williamson was the only candidate
with the guts to talk about it.

10:00.434 --> 10:01.810
So, Jer, how are you doing?

10:02.019 --> 10:04.646
I'm hanging in there.
Very happy to see you both.

10:04.980 --> 10:06.106
But the truth is, Claire, in this light,

10:06.190 --> 10:07.733
you're reminding me
so much of your mother.

10:07.733 --> 10:09.568
- Well, it's the hair.
- Same neck.

10:10.819 --> 10:14.740
Oh, you must be Jerry.
I'm Dylan's mom, Farrah.

10:14.740 --> 10:17.618
How wonderful to meet you.
Full disclosure, I'm a hugger.

10:17.784 --> 10:19.995
I'm sorry,
I'm not very comfortable with that,

10:19.995 --> 10:21.079
because I'm a kisser.

10:23.415 --> 10:24.791
Oh, what a lovely necklace.

10:24.875 --> 10:28.003
Well, thank you. It was made from the
wreckage of a Japanese whaling ship.

10:28.003 --> 10:29.755
How could the same people
who gave us the haiku

10:29.755 --> 10:31.632
want to hunt such a graceful creature?

10:31.840 --> 10:34.301
Oh well, I can guarantee
that absolutely no vegetables

10:34.301 --> 10:36.178
were harmed in the making of this salad.

10:36.303 --> 10:38.639
Actually, Claire,
it's been proven that plants feel pain.

10:38.639 --> 10:40.849
Yes. They scream when you rip
them from the ground.

10:41.350 --> 10:42.518
Oh, um...

10:42.518 --> 10:44.978
Then you're gonna hate
what happened to these grapes.

10:45.103 --> 10:46.772
That's okay, they're drunk.

10:48.649 --> 10:51.068
Oh well, it is such a nice day outside.

10:51.068 --> 10:53.445
Why don't the two of you
enjoy your wine in the backyard

10:53.529 --> 10:54.947
while we finish setting up in here?

10:55.072 --> 10:57.366
- What a lovely idea.
- Oh, Farrah,

10:57.366 --> 11:00.619
did you know that Jerry
is following the butterfly migration?

11:01.036 --> 11:03.288
- All the way to Mexico?
- I could spend the winter and spring

11:03.372 --> 11:05.707
hammock camping in
the Sierra Chincua sanctuary.

11:05.791 --> 11:07.835
That is one of my favorite
places on this Earth.

11:07.835 --> 11:09.670
- Oh, you've been there?
- Not in ages.

11:09.670 --> 11:11.755
But I would love to visit in this life.

11:11.964 --> 11:13.423
Oh...

11:14.091 --> 11:16.718
This is going so much better
than we even hoped.

11:16.969 --> 11:19.137
It's so weird, Jerry has such a type.

11:19.221 --> 11:22.850
I mean Farrah and my mom are the...
My mom...

11:23.058 --> 11:24.268
She's in the backyard.

11:24.560 --> 11:26.186
Oh, right.

11:26.436 --> 11:27.479
Oh, God.

11:27.563 --> 11:29.106
Um, I don't know what happened.

11:29.106 --> 11:31.108
It's DeDe. How did she get here?

11:31.108 --> 11:32.442
I thought she was at Mitchell's house.

11:32.568 --> 11:33.861
I don't understand.

11:34.361 --> 11:37.823
My mom's ashes are fused
to the roots of the tree.

11:37.948 --> 11:39.241
Of course.

11:39.700 --> 11:43.036
DeDe, I never would have flirted
with another woman in front of you.

11:43.161 --> 11:46.206
Unless it was that kind of weekend,
like that time in Taos.

11:46.290 --> 11:47.332
Ew!

11:47.416 --> 11:49.710
DeDe needs me. I shouldn't go anywhere.

11:50.002 --> 11:53.213
But... But what about
the butterflies and Mexico?

11:53.297 --> 11:56.758
Claire, I can feel it.
Your mother is in pain right now.

11:56.884 --> 11:59.553
Are we absolutely sure it's the tree?

11:59.553 --> 12:02.431
Because I do have an eggplant
parmesan under the broiler.

12:02.598 --> 12:03.682
I don't mean to overreact,

12:03.682 --> 12:06.643
but I think the situation may
call for some throat singing.

12:13.483 --> 12:15.861
All right, Mitch, Cam.

12:15.861 --> 12:17.321
- Okay, I'll go first.
- Okay.

12:17.321 --> 12:19.198
I'm tall, I'm strong,

12:19.198 --> 12:21.283
and I have a Matt Damon nose.

12:21.408 --> 12:22.993
- Okay.
- Okay?

12:23.118 --> 12:24.494
Mitchell, quick, me or Matt Damon?

12:24.578 --> 12:25.621
Don't think, just answer.

12:25.621 --> 12:27.039
- Okay, I'll give you that one.
- Yeah.

12:27.039 --> 12:29.249
All right, now me. Um...

12:29.333 --> 12:30.334
Perfect pitch.

12:30.334 --> 12:32.044
Well, what this baby needs is rhythm.

12:33.337 --> 12:34.671
And I've never had a cavity.

12:34.796 --> 12:36.548
I... I have good penmanship.

12:36.632 --> 12:39.927
Well, I had an aunt that lived
till 110 and she smoked a pipe every day.

12:40.177 --> 12:41.970
- I'm responsible.
- I'm nurturing.

12:42.054 --> 12:43.847
Okay, I'm nurturing, too.

12:43.931 --> 12:44.932
When Lily was a baby,

12:44.932 --> 12:48.227
I sang her to sleep every night,
with perfect pitch.

12:48.602 --> 12:50.687
Well, I used to look at her
through the window every morning

12:50.771 --> 12:53.315
when I'd drop her off at school until
the security guard took my picture.

12:53.524 --> 12:55.442
Okay. You know what?

12:55.692 --> 12:56.860
You. You be the donor.

12:56.944 --> 12:58.904
I don't think that
I can have a kid in the world

12:58.904 --> 13:00.405
and not be a part of their life.

13:00.489 --> 13:02.032
Oh, Mitchell, I don't think I can either.

13:02.032 --> 13:04.660
It would kill me to have
a little button-nosed beauty out there

13:04.660 --> 13:08.038
kicking up a storm as the first female
punter or the first male Rockette.

13:08.163 --> 13:10.999
We begged them.
We're going to look like such flakes.

13:11.083 --> 13:13.377
- They're going to be heartbroken.
- How do we tell them?

13:13.377 --> 13:15.254
We're just going to have to be
completely honest.

13:15.254 --> 13:17.673
We could tell them the microwave's
been on the fritz, and we're both sterile.

13:17.798 --> 13:19.216
Great, that, yeah.

13:22.803 --> 13:24.179
Okay.

13:24.847 --> 13:26.473
- Hi, it's us.
- Hey.

13:26.557 --> 13:29.643
Hey, what a surprise.
Honey, Mitch and Cam are here.

13:29.643 --> 13:31.895
Listen, we're sorry
for dropping in like this,

13:31.979 --> 13:33.397
uh, but there's something
we need to tell you.

13:33.397 --> 13:34.481
Yeah.

13:34.565 --> 13:35.607
What's up?

13:35.691 --> 13:38.610
Hi, okay, there's no easy way
to say this, um...

13:38.694 --> 13:41.071
We're just not comfortable donating sperm.

13:41.071 --> 13:44.449
And, you know, listen,
we were so flattered,

13:44.825 --> 13:46.827
but I think we just got
caught up in the moment.

13:47.369 --> 13:48.495
Oh! We get it.

13:48.579 --> 13:49.621
Yeah. No problem.

13:49.872 --> 13:51.248
- Oh, really?
- It's totally fine.

13:51.248 --> 13:52.666
Thank you so much for letting us know.

13:52.666 --> 13:54.418
- You guys are the best.
- Oh yeah, okay.

13:54.418 --> 13:55.586
- Have a good one.
- Sure.

13:55.919 --> 13:57.171
- Bye.
- Bye.

13:57.629 --> 13:59.298
I can't believe how well that went.

13:59.298 --> 14:02.718
Yeah, I know.
I feel so much better, that was so easy.

14:02.718 --> 14:04.970
Yeah. Like, really easy.

14:04.970 --> 14:06.388
Wait, was it too easy?

14:10.767 --> 14:11.977
I got this.

14:14.980 --> 14:16.315
- Hi.
- Hi, it's us again.

14:16.315 --> 14:17.983
- Yeah.
- Listen, um...

14:19.109 --> 14:20.319
What just happened?

14:20.444 --> 14:23.071
Because we just cratered
your entire family planning

14:23.155 --> 14:25.908
and all we get is, uh, "Have a good one"?

14:25.908 --> 14:27.910
You don't seem too broken up about it.

14:28.076 --> 14:30.204
Oh! No. We're super sad.

14:30.204 --> 14:32.206
- We're just lesbians.
- Okay.

14:32.206 --> 14:33.874
- Oh, of course.
- That's on us.

14:33.999 --> 14:35.209
That is on...

14:36.502 --> 14:38.003
- Who's that?
- Campbell.

14:38.003 --> 14:39.880
No, it's not.
You're the one with the masculine laugh.

14:39.880 --> 14:41.548
Yeah, and I'm suddenly aware

14:41.632 --> 14:43.634
that we've been talking
outside for a long time.

14:43.634 --> 14:44.801
Do... Do you mind if we come in?

14:44.885 --> 14:48.138
Yeah, no, not at all,
Mitch and Cam, come on in to the house!

14:49.681 --> 14:52.809
Hey, hey, Campbell, hi.
Who's your hunk?

14:52.935 --> 14:54.186
Hi, I'm Nathan.

14:54.394 --> 14:56.855
- Nathan.
- Hello, Nathan. What is...

14:57.147 --> 14:58.857
Champagne. Were you celebrating?

14:58.982 --> 15:02.110
With a man in possession
of some pretty remarkable genetics.

15:02.528 --> 15:06.281
Oh, I get it, that's why
you let us off the hook so easy.

15:06.448 --> 15:07.991
You were going to replace us.

15:08.242 --> 15:11.328
Okay, we're sorry.
Yes, he's going to donate.

15:11.453 --> 15:13.539
We did not plan this. We just met.

15:13.705 --> 15:14.998
- You just met?
- Met? Where?

15:15.082 --> 15:16.667
- How, when, how?
- How?

15:16.792 --> 15:18.877
He was our Lyft driver.

15:18.961 --> 15:21.296
His car was really clean,
he made excellent conversation.

15:21.380 --> 15:23.632
And I mean look at him.
You guys get it, right?

15:23.841 --> 15:25.300
That should be making babies.

15:25.467 --> 15:28.303
Look, at least we can tell
our friends that we were asked.

15:28.387 --> 15:31.348
Yeah, you know what?
Hey, second place isn't bad.

15:31.348 --> 15:32.432
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

15:32.516 --> 15:34.852
Oh, do you mind,
could we get a picture with you

15:34.852 --> 15:36.854
just to show all our friends
what it took to beat us out?

15:36.854 --> 15:38.522
Sure.
Sorry, thanks.

15:38.522 --> 15:40.274
- Okay.
- Would it help if I took off my shirt?

15:40.274 --> 15:42.192
Uh, probably. Yeah.
In so many ways.

15:42.276 --> 15:43.610
Yes, it would, here.

15:43.694 --> 15:45.988
- There it is. Okay.
- Wow. There it is.

15:46.238 --> 15:47.447
Okay.

15:47.531 --> 15:49.116
Why would you kiss Sherry?

15:49.116 --> 15:50.409
I didn't mean for it to happen.

15:50.409 --> 15:51.577
I'm not surprised.

15:51.577 --> 15:53.245
I've seen you make out
with a Mr. Potato Head.

15:53.370 --> 15:57.124
It was a Mrs. Potato Head.
She had the bow and the girl lips.

15:57.708 --> 15:59.251
I couldn't talk to Sherry before the show,

15:59.251 --> 16:00.586
so I had to sit through it.

16:00.794 --> 16:02.421
The first sketch was so bad,
I tried to bail,

16:02.421 --> 16:04.298
but they locked the doors.

16:05.048 --> 16:06.925
Then she walked on to stage...

16:07.259 --> 16:11.096
<i>Or should I say, the first octopus
president walked on stage.</i>

16:12.181 --> 16:14.683
Look, she's signing eight bills at once.

16:15.058 --> 16:16.894
And I'll never run out of ink.

16:18.187 --> 16:20.230
<i>Her performance was a Tour de France.</i>

16:20.522 --> 16:23.483
<i>She was like a hot girl version of my dad.</i>

16:23.901 --> 16:27.112
<i>Afterwards, we kept talking
and it just happened.</i>

16:27.321 --> 16:30.115
<i>I'm really sorry, but I think
I may have real feelings for her.</i>

16:30.324 --> 16:33.493
Listen to me, you are never
going to see Sherry ever again.

16:33.744 --> 16:35.078
I have to tell Manny the truth.

16:35.204 --> 16:37.247
- Don't you dare.
- Tell me what?

16:38.790 --> 16:40.417
Manny, I'm sorry, but...

16:41.335 --> 16:44.213
I kissed Sherry. I feel terrible about it.

16:46.381 --> 16:47.466
Are you okay?

16:47.966 --> 16:48.967
I will be.

16:49.635 --> 16:51.053
After I kick your ass!

16:51.053 --> 16:52.429
Hell yeah!

16:52.763 --> 16:54.806
Manny, violence is never the answer.

16:54.890 --> 16:56.016
Kid, you don't know what you're doing.

16:56.016 --> 16:58.977
Yes, I do. I got a "satisfactory"
in Beginning Stage Combat.

16:59.061 --> 17:00.729
And, action! Come here!

17:00.729 --> 17:03.774
Luke, Luke!
Whoa! Easy, easy.

17:03.774 --> 17:05.192
How could you? Of all the women!

17:05.192 --> 17:06.777
Come on, Luke.
No, no, no, no.

17:08.195 --> 17:09.196
Enough!

17:09.571 --> 17:12.616
Now, listen, I'm sorry
that you're hurting so badly.

17:12.616 --> 17:15.702
And I'm sorry that my plan
to help you move on was a disaster.

17:15.786 --> 17:17.538
But you're a good guy with a big heart,

17:17.538 --> 17:20.040
and you're gonna find the right person.
I promise you.

17:21.500 --> 17:22.626
And you.

17:23.001 --> 17:25.796
It was big of you to want to tell
Manny the truth to his face.

17:25.796 --> 17:27.798
- Thanks.
- But you crossed the line.

17:27.798 --> 17:29.925
You put yourself in front of your family

17:29.925 --> 17:32.803
and you hurt a guy
who loves you like a brother.

17:32.803 --> 17:34.596
You disappointed the hell out of me.

17:36.473 --> 17:37.808
I'm gonna ask you to leave.

17:39.017 --> 17:40.227
I'm sorry, Manny.

17:41.562 --> 17:42.604
Sorry, <i>Papi.</i>

17:44.857 --> 17:46.817
I think I need to be alone for a while.

17:47.067 --> 17:48.235
I understand.

17:48.402 --> 17:49.945
Just remember, Manny,

17:49.945 --> 17:52.823
I'm there for you
whenever there's a rainy day.

17:52.823 --> 17:54.324
'Cause we don't work those.

17:56.785 --> 17:58.579
Keep your chin up, kid.

17:58.829 --> 18:00.914
It's going to work out okay.

18:01.164 --> 18:03.500
I know. Thanks, Jay.

18:05.210 --> 18:06.795
I'm so sorry that I told you

18:06.879 --> 18:08.505
that you didn't care about other people.

18:08.589 --> 18:11.258
I care about other people,
I'm really very sensitive.

18:11.508 --> 18:13.385
That's great, so maybe tomorrow,

18:13.385 --> 18:16.555
you can take Joe to that
little boys' princess party.

18:16.680 --> 18:18.265
Little boys' princess party?

18:20.434 --> 18:23.687
I think it's nice that he has the freedom
to express himself that way.

18:24.771 --> 18:25.772
Pretty good, huh?

18:25.981 --> 18:27.858
They want the parents to go dress up too.

18:27.858 --> 18:29.193
Okay, I'm out.

18:29.860 --> 18:31.987
Forty-five minutes of sitar, and nothing.

18:32.654 --> 18:34.156
She can't be reasoned with.

18:34.323 --> 18:37.242
That's so DeDe.
She's clearly still upset with us.

18:37.784 --> 18:40.287
She does hold a grudge. Phil.

18:40.621 --> 18:42.414
Claire, could you try
and reason with your mother?

18:43.248 --> 18:47.753
Okay, Jerry, is it possible
that you are projecting your guilt

18:47.753 --> 18:50.923
about moving on because
that's not my mom over there.

18:51.465 --> 18:54.343
I don't mean to seem indelicate,
but you sound a little crazy right now.

18:54.343 --> 18:56.136
Please talk to the tree.

18:57.471 --> 18:58.472
Okay.

18:58.472 --> 18:59.890
Um...

19:01.934 --> 19:03.685
Hey, uh, Mom.

19:04.895 --> 19:07.856
So, uh, Jerry wants to go
to Mexico for a year...

19:07.940 --> 19:08.982
Four months.

19:09.107 --> 19:10.317
Worth a shot.

19:10.484 --> 19:15.405
And he's lonely,
so he wants to take his new friend.

19:16.448 --> 19:17.449
What?

19:18.909 --> 19:21.453
You're... Really? You're okay with it?

19:21.870 --> 19:23.747
She says, "Have fun."

19:23.747 --> 19:25.999
How did she sound?
Did she seem passive-aggressive?

19:26.083 --> 19:27.751
Yeah, maybe you should
double-check, Claire.

19:27.835 --> 19:29.878
Great. Thank you, Phil.

19:30.212 --> 19:31.421
Mom...

19:31.630 --> 19:37.010
After missing you a lot
and talking about very little else,

19:37.094 --> 19:38.178
um...

19:38.262 --> 19:43.016
Jerry finally met someone.
It's actually Dylan's mom, Farrah,

19:43.141 --> 19:46.144
and he wants to take her to Mexico.

19:47.980 --> 19:50.107
She's listening. Keep going.

19:50.107 --> 19:51.191
Um...

19:51.275 --> 19:54.611
Jerry is worried
that this would upset you,

19:54.695 --> 19:55.696
but I told him

19:55.696 --> 19:58.782
that you want him to be happy
and to move on, right?

19:59.616 --> 20:01.618
Please move, please move.

20:02.995 --> 20:05.372
DeDe, does the rustling mean yes?

20:07.124 --> 20:10.043
Thank you, DeDe.
I will always love you.

20:11.378 --> 20:12.504
I need some water.

20:12.588 --> 20:15.048
And let's go rescue that eggplant. Yes.

20:17.467 --> 20:20.262
That was crazy, did you see that?

20:20.262 --> 20:22.514
Hold on, your mom wants

20:22.598 --> 20:23.932
- to say something.
- What?

20:24.391 --> 20:25.851
"Hey, Claire Bear.

20:25.851 --> 20:28.645
"Maybe you should appreciate
Phil's magic more,

20:28.729 --> 20:31.231
"especially since he just
solved your problem."

20:31.315 --> 20:33.317
I can't believe it, you're a genius.

20:33.942 --> 20:34.943
Thank you.

20:35.027 --> 20:36.111
You're welcome. They don't call me...

20:36.195 --> 20:37.696
...Filament Dunphy for nothing.

20:37.696 --> 20:40.407
That is cute, but you are still
selling houses, right?

20:40.574 --> 20:43.493
Oh, shoot,
I have a showing in 20 minutes.

20:43.577 --> 20:45.287
Oh!

20:48.498 --> 20:49.499
Love you.

20:53.378 --> 20:55.964
Oh! I guess I should be
watering you more, huh?

20:56.048 --> 20:57.174
I've been busy.

20:57.466 --> 20:59.635
You're not even here
and I feel like you're judging me.

20:59.635 --> 21:02.346
Fine, I haven't been busy.

21:02.346 --> 21:04.056
I miss you.

21:04.973 --> 21:06.517
It's probably why
I didn't wanna see Jerry,

21:06.517 --> 21:08.727
he reminds me so much of you.

21:08.977 --> 21:11.355
It's also why Farrah drives me nuts.

21:12.022 --> 21:15.067
If I'm gonna have a kook in my house,
I want it to be you.

21:16.443 --> 21:17.444
Phil...

21:18.237 --> 21:19.488
Phil, stop it.

21:22.157 --> 21:24.368
Shut up, Mom, I like this haircut.
