Previously on
"Ex on the Beach"...

00:03.670 --> 00:07.107
ten super-hot
and super-single reality stars

00:07.173 --> 00:08.908
are looking for love in Malibu.

00:08.975 --> 00:13.313
But their exes are showing up
one by one.

00:13.380 --> 00:15.348
Corey's ex Sha arrived

00:15.415 --> 00:17.951
but she quickly realized
she's over him

00:18.017 --> 00:21.354
since he's been spending
all his time with Jozea.

00:23.423 --> 00:25.658
Malcolm's second ex
Nurys showed up,

00:25.725 --> 00:29.462
which totally derailed his
new fling with Maya... for now.

00:29.529 --> 00:32.298
{\an4}Maya, she does have
a thing for me.
You feel me?

00:32.365 --> 00:33.767
Don't worry, I'm coming
in the house,

00:33.833 --> 00:35.969
so that's gonna get cut off
right there, so don't worry.

00:36.035 --> 00:38.872
{\an5}(announcer)
Cheyenne threw a cute
little temper tantrum

00:38.938 --> 00:40.273
when his ex Murray

00:40.340 --> 00:43.476
{\an8}paid more attention
to his ex, Cory Z.

00:43.543 --> 00:45.512
I'm alone.
I've been alone all night.

00:45.578 --> 00:47.347
This sound very loud!

00:47.414 --> 00:50.884
{\an5}(announcer)
The Totem of Terror
sent Nurys, Morgan, and Corey

00:50.950 --> 00:52.085
down to the beach.

00:52.152 --> 00:54.220
Oh, my (bleep) God!

00:54.287 --> 00:57.690
{\an5}(announcer)
Things went downhill quick
for Morgan and her ex Jay

00:57.757 --> 01:00.827
when Morgan's sister
crashed their romantic date

01:00.894 --> 01:03.430
and warned Morgan to stay
away from Jay.

01:03.496 --> 01:05.632
{\an1}Y'all should both
peruse all options.

01:05.698 --> 01:07.834
{\an8}And tonight,
Morgan's caught in the middle

01:07.901 --> 01:10.737
{\an8}when her exes Jay and Corey
go head-to-head.

01:10.804 --> 01:12.205
(Morgan)
Jay, (bleep) stop!

01:12.272 --> 01:13.840
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no!

01:13.907 --> 01:15.875
(announcer)
Cheyenne sees an opportunity

01:15.942 --> 01:20.914
to get rid of Murray's ex,
Cory Z, once and for all.

01:20.980 --> 01:24.184
And there's a huge twist
during tonight's elimination

01:24.250 --> 01:25.985
that no one saw coming.

01:26.052 --> 01:28.087
(man)
Whoa...

01:28.154 --> 01:30.190
Savage.

01:30.256 --> 01:32.058

01:38.097 --> 01:40.366
{\an7}So, you want me to show you

01:40.433 --> 01:41.701
{\an9}I guess.

01:40.433 --> 01:41.701
{\an7}Okay.

01:41.768 --> 01:42.635
{\an9}No--

01:42.702 --> 01:45.772

01:45.839 --> 01:47.740
{\an8}Ugh!

01:47.807 --> 01:50.376
{\an8}Part of me is like,
"Oh my God, like, finally."

01:50.443 --> 01:52.612
{\an8}At the same time
I have Jay,

01:52.679 --> 01:55.014
{\an8}who's, like, still
in the back of my head.

01:55.081 --> 01:57.250
{\an1}You said you wanted me
to show you that I'm serious,

01:57.317 --> 01:59.886
and I like you, so...

01:59.953 --> 02:02.522
My life's a mess,
my life's a mess.

02:02.589 --> 02:04.958
{\an8}Morgan's always wanted me
to make moves on her,

02:05.024 --> 02:06.826
{\an8}me-attack-her type deal

02:06.893 --> 02:09.395
{\an8}and show her
that I like her, so I did it.

02:09.461 --> 02:12.198
{\an8}And she definitely responded
to the kiss,

02:12.265 --> 02:15.068
so, ultimately, I think
that she might come back to me.

02:15.134 --> 02:16.636
{\an1}Yeah, I just don't
see you and Jay together,

02:16.703 --> 02:18.605
{\an1}so I'm doing you both
a favor, honestly.

02:18.671 --> 02:20.540
So you're saying I should
go back in the house

02:20.607 --> 02:22.442
and say, "Bye, Jay,"
and be with you?

02:22.509 --> 02:24.410
{\an1}Hey, the heart
wants what it wants.

02:24.477 --> 02:26.779
So you don't care
about Sha anymore?

02:26.846 --> 02:28.448
{\an1}I'm just saying, I'm putting
it out there for you

02:28.515 --> 02:30.717
{\an1}and you can do--
you do what you will with it.

02:30.783 --> 02:32.151
{\an8}(Morgan)
I just don't wanna tell Jay.

02:32.218 --> 02:34.087
{\an8}I refuse to hurt him anymore
than I've hurt him

02:34.153 --> 02:35.822
{\an8}in this house, and...

02:35.889 --> 02:38.458
{\an8}I just don't
know what to do.

02:38.525 --> 02:40.493
{\an8}Every day is a different
bomb in this house.

02:40.560 --> 02:41.694
{\an5}Should we go back?

02:40.560 --> 02:41.694
{\an1}Good talk.

02:41.761 --> 02:44.063
Do not high-five
me right now.

02:47.433 --> 02:48.668
I understand
I hurt you,

02:48.735 --> 02:50.036
but the way you
took our relationship

02:50.103 --> 02:52.372
and just decided to throw
it in the trash

02:52.438 --> 02:53.673
because you were hurt?

02:53.740 --> 02:54.807
You could've
just spoke to me.

02:54.874 --> 02:56.009
We could've talked this out.

02:56.075 --> 02:57.677
You don't even want
the closure.

02:57.744 --> 02:58.912
{\an5}You don't want
the closure.

02:57.744 --> 02:58.912
What do you mean?

02:58.978 --> 03:00.380
We're not gonna be
friends outside of this.

03:00.446 --> 03:01.514
Like, we're not gonna
be anything,

03:01.581 --> 03:02.615
so what do
you want from me?

03:02.682 --> 03:03.683
I want this too,
'cause you know

03:03.750 --> 03:05.151
I'm not that type of guy.

03:05.218 --> 03:07.320
{\an1}You've done this to us, Nurys.
Do you not see that?

03:07.387 --> 03:08.755
{\an1}I don't-- I honestly
I don't care.

03:08.821 --> 03:10.123
{\an1}I don't even
want to talk anymore.

03:10.189 --> 03:13.660
{\an1}I really don't,
so I'm good.

03:13.726 --> 03:15.728
That's exactly what
little girls do.

03:15.795 --> 03:18.831
Walk away
from their problems.

03:18.898 --> 03:21.568
And that's exactly why
we're not together.

03:24.470 --> 03:27.440
We didn't come to a conclusion,
we didn't come to closure,

03:27.507 --> 03:29.576
and it's just
an open book.

03:29.642 --> 03:32.445
{\an8}(announcer)
Meanwhile, back at the house,

03:32.512 --> 03:35.148
{\an8}Maya's ex Kareem is trying
to get back into

03:35.214 --> 03:36.716
{\an8}Maya's good graces

03:36.783 --> 03:40.920
{\an8}after he spread a false rumor
about her having an STD.

03:40.987 --> 03:43.523
{\an8}And Farrah's getting
ready for a hot date

03:43.590 --> 03:45.024
{\an8}with her lawyer.

03:45.091 --> 03:49.295
{\an8}And by "date" I mean
"mandatory court appearance."

03:49.362 --> 03:51.397
{\an8}(Farrah)
I'm court chic today.

03:51.464 --> 03:53.933
{\an8}I have to go to court
for battery,

03:54.000 --> 03:56.069
{\an8}trespassing, resisting arrest.

03:56.135 --> 03:59.572
{\an8}So, after I told
everyone in the house...

03:59.639 --> 04:02.742
{\an8}I'm going to court
for battery.

04:02.809 --> 04:04.677
{\an8}Who you beat up, girl?

04:05.678 --> 04:08.982
{\an8}I'm just kind of, like...

04:09.048 --> 04:11.718
{\an8}sad that I have to bring up
this topic

04:11.784 --> 04:14.721
{\an8}because it's really not me.

04:14.787 --> 04:17.790
{\an8}Gotta bring my flops
with me

04:17.857 --> 04:19.858
{\an8}and my boobs
need to stay in.

04:19.926 --> 04:21.894
{\an8}What was the deal with her?
She had battery or something

04:21.961 --> 04:23.896
{\an8}and she's gotta go to trial
or some (bleep)?

04:23.963 --> 04:25.832
{\an7}I mean, I don't see--
I just don't see her fighting

04:25.898 --> 04:27.500
{\an7}all these gigantic
security guards.

04:27.567 --> 04:29.402
{\an7}It just makes
no sense to me.

04:29.469 --> 04:30.737
{\an8}(Farrah)
Off to court I go.

04:30.803 --> 04:32.271
{\an8}Oh my God, good luck.

04:32.338 --> 04:34.907
{\an8}I wish the whole house
could come with me to court.

04:34.974 --> 04:37.276
{\an8}I actually feel like
that's what I need

04:37.343 --> 04:38.678
{\an8}and the support I need.

04:38.745 --> 04:40.613
{\an8}It would make me feel
better at this point.

04:40.680 --> 04:44.117
{\an8}(announcer)
And while Farrah's legally
required to face her problems,

04:44.183 --> 04:47.820
{\an8}Murray and Cory Z voluntarily
try to work things out.

04:50.023 --> 04:53.960
{\an7}I guess this is how
it's going down.

04:54.027 --> 04:56.996
This is harder
than I thought.

04:57.063 --> 05:00.133
'Cause I came in here
just realizing that...

05:00.199 --> 05:01.234
{\an3}(sighing)

05:01.300 --> 05:03.569
...I hated you
for everything,

05:03.636 --> 05:06.005
and then just being
around you all the time,

05:06.072 --> 05:10.710
24/7, and just you
actually being nice,

05:10.777 --> 05:13.112
{\an1}it brings back a lot
and it has, like, in this...

05:13.179 --> 05:15.682
{\an1}You know, I enjoy the time
that we've spent so far here.

05:15.748 --> 05:17.183
{\an5}You know, like--

05:15.748 --> 05:17.183
{\an3}So have I.

05:17.250 --> 05:19.318
{\an1}That's not to say that
we won't have a lot more time

05:19.385 --> 05:22.422
to get through talking,
or talk through feelings

05:22.488 --> 05:25.224
or... every other option.

05:25.291 --> 05:26.859
{\an5}(Murray)
Cory Z and I dated
for a very long time,

05:26.926 --> 05:28.428
much longer than
me and Cheyenne,

05:28.494 --> 05:31.130
and I think there's still
a lot of raw feelings there

05:31.197 --> 05:33.299
{\an8}between us, and...

05:33.366 --> 05:36.269
{\an8}it's not that I necessarily
want to explore them,

05:36.335 --> 05:39.906
{\an8}but I do need a little bit
of closure with Cory Z,

05:39.972 --> 05:41.474
{\an8}and I'm worried about it

05:41.541 --> 05:43.976
{\an8}because if Cheyenne sees me
talking to Cory too much,

05:44.043 --> 05:46.012
{\an8}then, you know, the first
thing that he's gonna do

05:46.079 --> 05:47.180
{\an8}is vote him
out of the house.

05:47.246 --> 05:48.681
All I'm just saying
right now

05:48.748 --> 05:50.483
is just how
I'm feeling in this house.

05:50.550 --> 05:51.684
It's just all
coming back.

I did not come to rekindle
anything with him,

the outcome of that.

{\an8}Yeah, I love you,

disrespected me

08:09.822 --> 08:11.157
{\an8}because of the rumors,

08:11.224 --> 08:14.760
{\an8}so it's just like,
you gotta go, period.

08:14.827 --> 08:17.730
{\an1}You're a spoiled bitch.
Get out of my face.

08:17.797 --> 08:19.432
(laughing)

08:19.498 --> 08:22.168
♪♪

08:22.235 --> 08:23.970
♪ Put 'em up,
put 'em up ♪

08:24.036 --> 08:25.605
♪ Bang, bang, bang ♪♪

08:25.671 --> 08:26.839
Oh, we're back.

08:26.906 --> 08:28.274
(all)
Hey...

08:28.341 --> 08:29.375
(bleep).

08:29.442 --> 08:30.543
I don't have
an ex.

08:30.610 --> 08:32.510
{\an5}Yay!

08:30.610 --> 08:32.510
Yay!

08:32.578 --> 08:34.246
My man is free.

08:34.313 --> 08:36.782
{\an4}(Corey)
Yes, I'm stable again.

08:34.313 --> 08:36.782
Yes.

08:36.849 --> 08:39.986
{\an8}(Sha)
The whole tension
between Corey and I is off

08:40.052 --> 08:42.154
{\an8}because I'm here,

08:42.221 --> 08:45.258
{\an8}trying to figure out
if we're gonna fix things

08:45.324 --> 08:47.026
{\an8}and he's over here cuddling
with a guy.

08:47.093 --> 08:50.096
{\an8}Maybe they're just
very, very good friends,

08:50.162 --> 08:52.999
{\an8}but by any means anyone I think
would be confused.

08:53.065 --> 08:54.367
{\an8}Literally, the whole
house is confused.

08:54.433 --> 08:55.434
{\an8}It wasn't just me.

08:55.501 --> 08:56.836
{\an1}(Jozea)
So, who is it?

08:56.903 --> 08:58.537
It is Nurys' ex.

08:58.604 --> 08:59.538
{\an5}Nelson?

08:58.604 --> 08:59.538
{\an3}Nelson.

08:59.605 --> 09:01.407
{\an5}(screaming)

08:59.605 --> 09:01.407
{\an3}Nelson.

09:01.474 --> 09:02.975
{\an4}(Corey)
They had a screaming
match on the beach.

09:03.042 --> 09:04.110
Within the first
ten seconds,

09:04.176 --> 09:06.178
they were
up at each other.

09:06.245 --> 09:07.380
Damn.

09:07.446 --> 09:09.115
{\an8}(Malcolm)
Me and Nurys just got good

09:09.181 --> 09:10.549
{\an8}and we're trying to establish
something,

09:10.616 --> 09:12.451
{\an8}so, at this point, man,
I'm just a little nervous

09:12.518 --> 09:15.254
{\an8}because I feel like if she
she sees Nelson,

09:15.321 --> 09:16.756
{\an8}she's gonna
fall back into it,

09:16.822 --> 09:18.024
she's gonna get upset.

09:18.090 --> 09:19.592
{\an4}(Morgan)
Isn't Nelson
your ex too?

09:19.659 --> 09:21.027
Kind of.

09:21.093 --> 09:23.095
(Janelle)
I met Nelson at the club

09:23.162 --> 09:25.998
{\an8}and Nelson tried
to kiss me.

09:26.065 --> 09:28.868
{\an8}Key word: tried.
And got denied.

09:28.935 --> 09:30.603
{\an5}How was your day?

09:28.935 --> 09:30.603
Good.

09:30.670 --> 09:32.471
You talk with Corey?

09:30.670 --> 09:32.471
{\an3}Yeah.

09:32.538 --> 09:34.073
{\an1}Then why are you looking
at me weird, (bleep)?

09:34.140 --> 09:35.841
I'm not looking
at you weird.

09:35.908 --> 09:38.411
{\an8}I do not have a poker face.

09:38.477 --> 09:40.846
{\an8}Jay can tell immediately
that something is wrong.

09:40.913 --> 09:42.715
We should go
to the bathroom soon.

09:42.782 --> 09:45.184
{\an1}Oh!

09:45.251 --> 09:48.087
{\an8}I don't want to tell him
because I need some more time

09:48.154 --> 09:49.555
{\an8}to process things.

09:49.622 --> 09:51.857
{\an8}I need some time to think
about what I want.

09:51.924 --> 09:54.460
Is it good or bad
or (bleep)?

09:54.527 --> 09:57.763
{\an8}Yeah, but overall,
he's a cool dude.
Really cool dude.

09:57.830 --> 10:00.099
{\an8}You'll like him,
y'all like him.

10:00.166 --> 10:02.768
{\an8}I cannot read you
for (bleep) right now.

10:02.835 --> 10:04.370
{\an8}My mind is going insane.

10:04.437 --> 10:06.038
{\an8}What the (bleep)
is going on?

10:06.105 --> 10:07.406
Are you hiding something?

10:12.144 --> 10:13.713
{\an5}(announcer)
Welcome back.
Let's get you caught up.

10:13.779 --> 10:15.614
Morgan and Jay's
tension isn't the only thing

10:15.681 --> 10:17.149
in the air
right now.

10:17.216 --> 10:19.151
There's also this guy.

10:19.218 --> 10:20.786
(woman)
That looks so fun!

10:20.853 --> 10:23.322
{\an1}(Jozea)
No, that's scary as (bleep).

10:23.389 --> 10:24.657
They're living
their best life.

10:24.724 --> 10:26.525
You know who's not
living their best life?

10:26.592 --> 10:28.327
Nurys and Nelson.

10:28.394 --> 10:30.930
♪♪

10:30.997 --> 10:33.499
(bleep).

10:33.566 --> 10:34.767
(Malcolm)
Wow.

10:34.834 --> 10:36.168
Oh, wow.

10:36.235 --> 10:37.970
You know, had to come
set some things straight.

10:38.037 --> 10:39.372
{\an4}What's up, what's up,
what's up?

10:38.037 --> 10:39.372
How you doing,
baby?

10:39.438 --> 10:40.906
{\an5}Good, good, good.

10:39.438 --> 10:40.906
Good, good, good.

10:40.973 --> 10:42.241
{\an5}(Maya)
Judging by the look
on Malcolm's face,

10:42.308 --> 10:43.743
he is not happy.

10:43.809 --> 10:45.411
{\an8}But I hope that Nelson
can mess up what they have.

10:45.478 --> 10:47.146
I'm petty, I know.

10:47.213 --> 10:48.314
I'm Nelson.

10:48.381 --> 10:49.515
What up, brother?
Nelson.

10:49.582 --> 10:50.883
{\an5}Hello.

10:49.582 --> 10:50.883
{\an1}(Nelson)
Hey, beautiful.

10:50.950 --> 10:52.385
How's it going?

10:52.451 --> 10:53.953
{\an8}Nelson coming into the house
is going to affect Malcolm

10:54.020 --> 10:56.756
{\an8}because Malcolm gets
jealous very, very quickly.

10:56.822 --> 10:59.258
All right, Nelson,
why are you here?

10:59.325 --> 11:01.293
The fact that she went
behind my back

11:01.360 --> 11:03.262
'cause she was
hurt and angry

11:03.329 --> 11:04.864
and to do that
and not tell me--

11:04.930 --> 11:06.232
she disrespected me

11:06.298 --> 11:08.000
and that's why
I'm here right now.

11:08.067 --> 11:10.036
I'm not in the wrong
for giving her the truth.

11:10.102 --> 11:11.137
I'm not!
Whether it-- why--

11:11.203 --> 11:12.638
I didn't
say that, babe.

11:12.705 --> 11:14.006
{\an5}Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

11:12.705 --> 11:14.006
She messaged me!

11:14.073 --> 11:15.508
{\an5}She messaged me.

11:14.073 --> 11:15.508
{\an1}Let me be
the mediator.

11:15.574 --> 11:17.009
{\an6}Exactly.

11:15.574 --> 11:17.009
So Kayleigh messaged you.

11:17.076 --> 11:19.045
She messaged me.
I have the DMs still.

11:19.111 --> 11:20.813
{\an5}She asked me for the truth
so I gave her the truth.

11:19.111 --> 11:20.813
And she asked her...

11:20.880 --> 11:23.015
{\an4}what's going on
between y'all two...

11:20.880 --> 11:23.015
{\an3}Exactly.

11:23.082 --> 11:24.350
{\an1}...and she spilt
the tea!

11:24.417 --> 11:25.718
{\an8}(Nelson)
Kayleigh is my ex.

11:25.785 --> 11:27.086
{\an8}We met on "The Challenge"

11:27.153 --> 11:29.155
{\an8}and I ended up sleeping
with Nurys that one week

11:29.221 --> 11:30.556
{\an8}we were broken up

11:30.623 --> 11:32.124
{\an8}and Nurys felt like
she had to be honest.

11:32.191 --> 11:34.527
{\an8}But she should've talked to me
first out of respect.

11:34.593 --> 11:35.594
{\an1}(Nurys)
I'm gonna mention you two.

11:35.661 --> 11:37.163
You guys just (bleep).

11:37.229 --> 11:39.932
His ex hits you up, being like,
"Hey, did something happen

11:39.999 --> 11:41.534
and will you
please be honest with me?"

11:41.600 --> 11:43.135
You're not gonna give
the person the truth?

11:43.202 --> 11:44.637
Any of you guys?

11:44.703 --> 11:45.905
You're not gonna give--
the person that asked you--

11:45.971 --> 11:47.606
hold on-- the person
that messaged--

11:47.673 --> 11:48.741
{\an5}hold on!

11:47.673 --> 11:48.741
'Cause this ain't
making no sense--

11:48.808 --> 11:50.142
Shut up!
She messaged me!

11:50.209 --> 11:52.078
I didn't (bleep) out of
my way to message her!

11:52.144 --> 11:53.345
(bleep).

11:53.412 --> 11:55.214
{\an8}Oh, man.

11:55.281 --> 11:56.982
{\an8}I'm surrounded
by idiots.

11:57.049 --> 11:58.284
{\an8}It's kind of hilarious.

11:58.350 --> 12:00.286
{\an8}But, honestly,
there's so many of them

12:00.352 --> 12:03.856
{\an8}that I think that they're just
gonna, like, team up.

12:03.923 --> 12:08.094
{\an8}And it's
honestly gonna be me...

12:08.160 --> 12:10.162
{\an8}like, against the idiots.

12:10.229 --> 12:13.966
{\an4}(Janelle)
And, you wanna know
what he did now?

12:14.033 --> 12:17.002
Like, a month ago,
he hit up Diandra.

12:17.069 --> 12:19.171
He jumped in her DMs.

12:21.373 --> 12:24.009
{\an8}Oh, this is "messy-esy,"
Bessy!

12:24.076 --> 12:25.277
{\an8}(laughing)

12:25.344 --> 12:26.512
{\an1}(Nelson)
I have no problem with that.

12:26.579 --> 12:27.746
It's 2018, that's what
we do.

12:27.813 --> 12:29.181
{\an5}No, no, no.

12:27.813 --> 12:29.181
Social media--

12:29.248 --> 12:30.449
Okay, you slid in my DMs
but I entertained it--

12:30.516 --> 12:31.784
bad, did that.

12:31.851 --> 12:33.719
Did I think you were cute?
Yes, I did.

12:33.786 --> 12:35.421
In the back of my head,
did I wanna do anything?

12:35.488 --> 12:36.722
No, because, yes, I was cool
with Nurys.

12:36.789 --> 12:38.157
(Diandra)
Nelson is an attractive man.

12:38.224 --> 12:39.358
I cannot lie
about that.

12:39.425 --> 12:40.993
And Nurys knows that.

12:41.060 --> 12:44.530
{\an8}But would never hook up with him
no matter how much I want to.

12:44.597 --> 12:47.166
{\an8}It's-- is a guy
really worth a friendship?

12:47.233 --> 12:49.869
When we went out to New York,
I told you, I pulled you aside.

12:49.935 --> 12:51.604
You said-- you asked me
a couple questions.

12:51.670 --> 12:53.005
Then you say,
"Okay, thank you for..."

12:53.072 --> 12:55.207
{\an1}Ooh, bitch, you gotta
watch your friends these days!

12:55.274 --> 12:56.942
You gotta watch!

12:57.009 --> 12:58.344
Girl!

12:58.410 --> 13:01.714
{\an8}To be that type of woman,
I just feel like she's

13:01.780 --> 13:02.982
{\an8}just a side (bleep).

13:03.048 --> 13:04.683
{\an1}I would literally
be mad at both y'all.

13:04.750 --> 13:06.552
{\an1}I would be like,
"You would know better,

13:06.619 --> 13:07.720
and you should
know better."

13:07.786 --> 13:08.954
You know what, it's 2018

13:09.021 --> 13:11.123
{\an1}and you can't trust
these (bleep).

13:11.190 --> 13:12.424
You really can't.

13:12.491 --> 13:14.627
What is this even
about anymore?

13:14.693 --> 13:16.662
{\an8}I'm not gonna be the type of guy
to just sit around

13:16.729 --> 13:18.764
{\an8}and wait for her
to get over someone like that.

13:18.831 --> 13:20.799
{\an8}I feel like Maya's interested
in me still,

13:20.866 --> 13:22.768
{\an8}so I'm not gonna
keep fighting her off

13:22.835 --> 13:24.737
{\an8}for someone who's chasing
someone else.

13:24.803 --> 13:26.338
{\an7}I'm feeling some type of way.
I'm not gonna lie.

13:26.405 --> 13:27.640
{\an8}I can tell,
I can see that.

13:27.706 --> 13:29.775
{\an8}So I'm definitely
gonna, you know...

13:29.842 --> 13:32.044
{\an7}I'm chill, but I need
some time

13:32.111 --> 13:34.079
{\an7}to think about
some (bleep), for sure.

13:32.111 --> 13:34.079
{\an6}Yeah.

13:34.146 --> 13:36.048
{\an8}After everything that
I'm going through with Nelson,

13:36.115 --> 13:38.083
{\an8}it's actually making me
wanna try even harder

13:38.150 --> 13:39.952
{\an8}to make everything work
between me and Malcolm.

13:40.019 --> 13:42.588
{\an8}I really wanna give him
this real chance now.

13:42.655 --> 13:43.722
Oh, (bleep), look.

13:43.789 --> 13:45.624
{\an1}Look it, look it,
look it.

13:45.691 --> 13:47.092
I saw this one coming.

13:47.159 --> 13:48.394
What's bothering you?

13:48.460 --> 13:49.461
Just tell me
what's bothering you.

13:49.528 --> 13:50.563
(sighing)

13:50.629 --> 13:51.830
Oh, she trying
to talk to him.

13:51.897 --> 13:52.965
{\an1}He ain't trying to hear
what she gotta say.

13:53.032 --> 13:54.300
{\an1}Bro, I see the way
you look at him,

13:54.366 --> 13:55.701
{\an1}I see the way
you talk about him.

13:55.768 --> 13:57.336
You have feelings
for Nelson, I see it.

13:57.403 --> 13:59.138
{\an8}At this point I do feel like
I'm gonna pull away from Nurys

13:59.205 --> 14:00.940
{\an8}because she definitely has
some unsolved issues

14:01.006 --> 14:03.709
{\an8}with Nelson that
I don't want no part of.

14:03.776 --> 14:05.377
{\an1}You told me before I left,
"I have your back."

14:05.444 --> 14:07.213
{\an5}I do.

14:05.444 --> 14:07.213
{\an1}"I'm gonna
be here for you."

14:07.279 --> 14:08.414
No, you do not
have my back.

14:08.480 --> 14:11.784
(laughing)

14:11.850 --> 14:13.752
Ahh...

14:13.819 --> 14:15.120
Today's my day, bitch.

14:15.187 --> 14:16.655
{\an8}(Maya)
This is fun. It's not me.

14:16.722 --> 14:18.757
{\an8}I'm watching it unfold.

14:18.824 --> 14:20.759
{\an8}I feel like this
is the perfect opportunity

14:20.826 --> 14:22.828
{\an8}for me and Malcolm
to re-explore things,

14:22.895 --> 14:24.496
{\an8}because, clearly,
she's on thin ice.

14:24.563 --> 14:26.298
{\an1}Like, if you need me
to reassure your (bleep)

14:26.365 --> 14:27.733
{\an4}that I'm here for you,
like...

14:26.365 --> 14:27.733
{\an3}It's okay.

14:27.800 --> 14:29.101

{\an1}You wanna go and kiss her,
you piece of (bleep)?!

22:13.465 --> 22:14.966
Go (bleep) yourself, dude!

22:15.033 --> 22:17.369
{\an5}(Corey)
I'm sorry, bro,
but she doesn't want you.

22:17.436 --> 22:19.037
She wants this.

22:19.104 --> 22:21.773
{\an5}(bleeps).

22:19.104 --> 22:21.773
She wants Daddy,
okay?

22:21.840 --> 22:23.141
She wants me.

22:23.208 --> 22:25.444
(Sha)
Corey, that's (bleep) up, dude.

22:25.510 --> 22:27.612
Bro, stop trying
to piss him off, like...

22:27.679 --> 22:28.714
No, Corey,
that is (bleep) up

22:28.780 --> 22:29.848
and I'm sitting here also.

22:29.915 --> 22:31.049
{\an1}(Jozea)
Let's go.

22:31.116 --> 22:32.417
Dude, honestly,
that's (bleep) up.

22:32.484 --> 22:34.019
That's really (bleep).

22:34.086 --> 22:35.454
{\an8}(Sha)
I definitely think
Corey wants to be with her,

22:35.520 --> 22:36.988
{\an8}and seeing that just was
like the cherry on top.

22:37.055 --> 22:38.290
I'm over him.

22:38.356 --> 22:39.991
She doesn't see
longevity with him.

22:40.058 --> 22:41.493
She sees longevity
with you.

22:41.560 --> 22:42.928
No, Jay, (bleep)!

22:42.994 --> 22:44.329
{\an8}Jay's just, like,
losing his mind.

22:44.396 --> 22:45.731
{\an8}He's going after Corey
and it's like, dude,

22:45.797 --> 22:47.232
{\an8}like, he's, like,
twice your size.

22:47.299 --> 22:48.934
{\an8}He's gonna crush you.
It's just... it's science.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.235
{\an8}No, (bleep) stop!

22:50.302 --> 22:51.703
{\an8}No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no!

22:51.770 --> 22:53.205
{\an8}(bleep).

22:53.271 --> 22:54.806
{\an8}Out of nowhere,
I'm, like, mid-flight,

22:54.873 --> 22:57.075
{\an8}like, "I'm going for it."

22:57.142 --> 22:59.444
{\an8}(distorted)
Let's go, Corey Brooks.

22:59.511 --> 23:01.346
Kareem just comes up
and he's like--

23:01.413 --> 23:02.948
huh-- body slam!

23:03.014 --> 23:04.616
{\an4}(Corey)
Get the (bleep)
out of here.

23:04.683 --> 23:06.918

Oh, man, I gotta give
Jay his props, man.

23:06.985 --> 23:08.253
{\an8}Fighting for his love.

23:08.320 --> 23:10.355
{\an8}Man, you go fight
for your love, boy.

23:10.422 --> 23:11.590
{\an8}Go get your girl.

23:11.656 --> 23:14.226
{\an7}No, I don't seem to be
under six foot under me.

23:14.292 --> 23:16.094
{\an8}Jay was in the kiddy pool
and he was, like,

23:16.161 --> 23:17.996
{\an8}trying to get to the shark tank
and it wasn't happening.

23:18.063 --> 23:21.133
{\an5}(announcer)
This totally ruined
the Free Farrah party.

about all this.

Stop, Jay!

23:28.073 --> 23:29.641
{\an1}Don't get mad at me,
get mad at your girl, bro!

23:29.708 --> 23:30.709
Stop!

23:30.776 --> 23:31.877
Get mad at your girl.

23:31.943 --> 23:33.645

Are you kidding me, Jay?!

23:50.729 --> 23:51.763
You (bleep) kissed him!

No, I didn't, Jay!

with me and Corey,

{\an8}there's, like, so many
unanswered questions.

24:17.622 --> 24:19.357
{\an8}It's, like...

24:17.622 --> 24:19.357
{\an8}Well, yeah, for sure.

24:19.424 --> 24:20.759
{\an7}Corey does not
know how to talk.

24:20.826 --> 24:21.893
{\an8}Thank you.

24:21.960 --> 24:23.962
{\an7}Corey, what are you
doing to us?

24:24.029 --> 24:27.065
{\an8}What is here for?
Me, you, Jozea?

24:27.132 --> 24:28.900
{\an8}Like, make up
your mind at this point.

24:28.967 --> 24:30.435

So, what do you want, though?

24:30.502 --> 24:32.337
'Cause I know you're,
like, playing with like--

24:32.404 --> 24:33.438
{\an3}I know.

24:33.505 --> 24:34.506
Do you really, like,
like Jay?

24:34.573 --> 24:37.075
Yeah, no,
I really like Jay.

I-- but-- now what
scares me

24:38.743 --> 24:40.679
is, like, I didn't
like that side of him.

24:40.745 --> 24:43.448
{\an8}Why would you risk
you and Jay over Corey B?

24:43.515 --> 24:45.250
{\an8}Someone that clearly doesn't
know what he wants.

{\an8}I truly hope
that they can get it together

24:47.285 --> 24:48.720
{\an8}and pull through.

24:48.787 --> 24:50.288
{\an1}Had Corey come first
and, like, Jay came second,

24:50.355 --> 24:51.923
would it be different?

24:51.990 --> 24:53.491
I wish I--
like, I don't know.

24:53.558 --> 24:54.860
Like, maybe.

24:54.926 --> 24:57.028
What was I supposed
to do?

you need to figure out

"Oh, I kissed him."

kissed me.

{\an5}(announcer)
Jay, Corey,
what's the difference?

26:04.095 --> 26:05.430
Morgan keeps attacking me

26:05.497 --> 26:07.132
and leading me on
and egging me on.

26:07.198 --> 26:08.466
{\an5}"We're so perfect
for each other."

26:08.533 --> 26:09.567
{\an9}Blah-blah.

26:09.634 --> 26:11.169
{\an8}And I'm like, "Okay,
Morgan, I get it."

26:11.236 --> 26:12.570
{\an8}So, went down to the beach
and she did it again.

26:12.637 --> 26:14.172
I was like, "Okay,
you know what?

26:14.239 --> 26:15.340
This is how I feel."

26:15.407 --> 26:16.641
So-- boom--
I kissed her.

26:16.708 --> 26:18.143
I said, "There you go,
Morgan.

26:18.209 --> 26:19.344
Ball's in
your court, make a move."

26:19.411 --> 26:20.612
We come down to the house,

26:20.679 --> 26:22.147
she goes straight for
(bleep) Jay,

26:22.213 --> 26:23.982
kisses him,
cuddling him all day.

26:24.049 --> 26:25.183
Doesn't even
look at me.

26:25.250 --> 26:26.584
{\an5}Like a ding-a-ling.

26:25.250 --> 26:26.584
Yeah.

26:26.651 --> 26:28.420
{\an1}You look like a (bleep)
dildo just sitting around

26:28.486 --> 26:29.788
{\an5}doing nothing--

26:28.486 --> 26:29.788
I'm like, "Okay,
is that my answer?"

26:29.854 --> 26:31.022
You know what I'm saying?

26:31.089 --> 26:32.290
But my thing
with Morgan is like,

26:32.357 --> 26:33.591
if you don't know
what you want,

26:33.658 --> 26:34.826
just say you don't
know what you want.

26:34.893 --> 26:35.994
You know what I'm saying?

26:36.061 --> 26:37.195
{\an1}Yeah, and you're
playing the field.

26:37.262 --> 26:38.430
Don't sit here
and lead him on

26:38.496 --> 26:39.931
and he's, like,
giving you all he's got.

26:39.998 --> 26:42.701
{\an8}I don't know why Morgan felt
the need to hurt Jay

26:42.767 --> 26:44.002
{\an8}the way that she did,

26:44.069 --> 26:46.805
{\an8}but he's
a good guy and...

26:46.871 --> 26:49.541
{\an8}maybe he doesn't deserve
somebody like her.

26:49.607 --> 26:51.876
If I had to pick
between him and you,

26:51.943 --> 26:53.278
I, 100%, would--

26:53.345 --> 26:55.313
{\an1}I would send him
out of this house right now.

26:56.481 --> 26:58.116

the games, so...

26:58.183 --> 26:59.951
I'm closing that door.

27:00.018 --> 27:01.653

27:03.888 --> 27:05.190
{\an5}Okay?

27:03.888 --> 27:05.190
{\an3}Right.

27:05.256 --> 27:06.825
{\an8}I'm just being trustworthy
and just, like,

27:06.891 --> 27:10.261
{\an8}being okay with it because
she has exes bombarding her,

27:10.328 --> 27:11.663
{\an8}she has feelings on both ends.

27:11.730 --> 27:13.164
{\an8}She never closed the door
for either end.

27:13.231 --> 27:15.934
But in the back
of my mind, I'm like,

27:16.001 --> 27:17.635
"Should I even trust you?"

♪♪

27:26.177 --> 27:27.645

did what you did.

You stood up

{\an8}and I came her
for clarity.

27:38.089 --> 27:40.592

work things out and move on.

27:40.658 --> 27:42.761

her the truth

27:42.827 --> 27:44.896
{\an1}ended up (bleep),
ended up-- whatever.

27:44.963 --> 27:46.664
{\an1}It caused all this drama,
and I get it

27:46.731 --> 27:48.133
and I'm sorry for that.

27:48.199 --> 27:49.367
You pissed me off.

27:49.434 --> 27:50.535
I said what
I had to say at the beach.

27:50.602 --> 27:51.770
Very furious.

27:51.836 --> 27:52.971
But now it's like
I'm not trying

27:53.038 --> 27:54.806
to keep fighting
and going back and forth

27:54.873 --> 27:56.141
and saying who's right,
who's wrong.

27:56.207 --> 27:57.675
{\an1}Me either.

27:57.742 --> 27:59.711
{\an8}Nelson acts completely different
when he's with me

27:59.778 --> 28:00.979
{\an8}than when he's
around other people.

28:01.046 --> 28:02.680
{\an8}When he's around other people,

28:02.747 --> 28:04.182
{\an8}he wants to make it seem
like he doesn't really care,

28:04.249 --> 28:05.583
but then when he's with me
he opens up his heart

28:05.650 --> 28:07.085
and shows me
a different side of him.

28:07.152 --> 28:08.987
But, hands down, no questions
about it--

28:09.054 --> 28:10.989
Nelson is <i> the</i> biggest
player in this house.

28:11.056 --> 28:12.891
Our relationship,
I don't know where

28:12.957 --> 28:14.292
it's gonna go from here,
honestly.

28:14.359 --> 28:16.127
I'm not against us talking.

28:16.194 --> 28:18.329
I'm not against us,
you know,

28:18.396 --> 28:19.697
being friends or whatever.

28:19.764 --> 28:21.900
{\an8}I've came to the conclusion
that Nurys and I

28:21.966 --> 28:23.435
{\an8}are just gonna be friends.

28:23.501 --> 28:25.003
{\an8}I don't wanna
go down that path.

28:25.070 --> 28:26.237
It didn't work out
the first time

28:26.304 --> 28:28.740
and we have
great friend chemistry

28:28.807 --> 28:30.408
and that's where
I wanna keep it.

the other girls in the house.

28:32.510 --> 28:33.778
{\an3}We're good?

28:33.845 --> 28:35.480
{\an5}We're good.

28:33.845 --> 28:35.480
All right.

28:35.547 --> 28:36.981
{\an5}Give me a hug.

28:35.547 --> 28:36.981
No!

28:37.048 --> 28:38.183
Why?

28:38.249 --> 28:40.285
{\an1}You wanna shake my hand?
We can shake hands.

28:40.351 --> 28:41.619
{\an5}We cool.

28:40.351 --> 28:41.619
(laughing)

28:43.488 --> 28:44.722
I, like, hit him.

28:44.789 --> 28:46.558
{\an1}And he-- and he didn't know
what was going on.

28:46.624 --> 28:47.826
Oh!

28:49.060 --> 28:51.563
Oh, (bleeps).

28:51.629 --> 28:52.897
{\an8}Every time I hear that sound,

28:52.964 --> 28:54.099
{\an8}my armpits
instantly start sweating.

28:54.165 --> 28:56.134
"Votes speak louder
than words.

28:56.201 --> 28:58.336
{\an5}"Especially when it comes
to getting your ex
out of the house.

28:58.403 --> 28:59.737
"The polls are open.

28:59.804 --> 29:01.039
Head down to the Shack
and cast your votes."

29:01.106 --> 29:01.940
Ooh...

29:02.006 --> 29:03.575
{\an4}I'm done.

29:02.006 --> 29:03.575
Yup, I'm ready.

29:03.641 --> 29:05.043
(laughing)

29:05.110 --> 29:06.611
{\an3}Whoo.

29:06.678 --> 29:08.746
Clearing house.

29:08.813 --> 29:11.516
I know I am up
for elimination

29:11.583 --> 29:13.885
'cause I know Corey would
like to get me out of here

29:13.952 --> 29:15.220
and, like, you know,

29:15.286 --> 29:17.122
"I'll (bleep) Jay
'cause I want his girl."

29:17.188 --> 29:19.691
Like you sneak-attack-kissing
mother(bleep).

29:19.757 --> 29:22.227
(laughing)

29:24.996 --> 29:28.266
{\an4}(Morgan)
Corey, do you wanna
go downstairs and chat?

29:28.333 --> 29:29.968
To me it's, like...

29:30.034 --> 29:31.236
I don't know,
it's a mess.

29:31.302 --> 29:33.104
{\an1}And I wanna close
that door between us

29:33.171 --> 29:35.473
{\an1}'cause I don't think
it's fair to Jay

29:35.540 --> 29:37.075
and I wanna work
on that with him.

29:37.142 --> 29:38.610
You don't wanna
be with Jay.

29:38.676 --> 29:40.278
{\an4}Yes, I do.

29:38.676 --> 29:40.278
Hmm, no, you don't.

29:40.345 --> 29:42.347
{\an8}I don't think Morgan has a whole
lot of feelings for Jay.

29:42.413 --> 29:43.715
{\an8}I just don't.

29:43.781 --> 29:45.517
{\an8}Like, I think a lot
of it's just for show.

29:45.583 --> 29:46.784
{\an8}It's fake.

29:46.851 --> 29:48.486
At the end of the day,
I still had two guys.

29:48.553 --> 29:50.488
{\an5}I have to pick one.

29:48.553 --> 29:50.488
Right.

29:50.555 --> 29:51.856
{\an3}Okay.

29:51.923 --> 29:53.424
{\an8}I think if I would have,
from the get-go,

29:53.491 --> 29:55.894
{\an8}just been like, Morgan,
ignore your emotions.

29:55.960 --> 29:58.196
{\an8}Stick with Jay,
you have your guy.

29:58.263 --> 29:59.330
{\an8}Forget about Corey.

29:59.397 --> 30:01.432
{\an8}None of this would
have happened.

30:01.499 --> 30:04.035
{\an8}But... I'm a mess!

30:04.102 --> 30:05.904
{\an1}I'm just gonna end
the conversation here.

30:05.970 --> 30:07.705
All right, good talk.

30:07.772 --> 30:09.107
Yeah, you too.

30:09.174 --> 30:10.808
{\an1}I wish we wouldn't have
all had to scream and fight,

30:10.875 --> 30:13.144
{\an1}and bleed and yell
at each other

30:13.211 --> 30:14.946
{\an5}to get to that, but...

30:13.211 --> 30:14.946
Yup.

30:15.013 --> 30:16.814
(Corey)
Morgan is moving on with Jay,

30:16.881 --> 30:18.516
so I guess I'm gonna
move on with my life.

30:18.583 --> 30:20.118
{\an8}Peace and love.

30:20.185 --> 30:22.153
{\an8}Morgan, good luck
to you, baby.

30:22.220 --> 30:23.922
{\an8}(clicks tongue)

30:25.256 --> 30:26.524
{\an4}(woman)
I feel like
we're missing somebody.

30:26.591 --> 30:27.725
{\an4}Farrah.

30:26.591 --> 30:27.725
Yeah. Farrah.

30:27.792 --> 30:28.927
Where is Farrah?

30:28.993 --> 30:31.296
There is trash
on the floor,

30:31.362 --> 30:34.098
{\an1}if you'd like to bring
a sweeper and a dustpan.

30:34.165 --> 30:36.668
{\an1}And the trash
has overflowed,

30:36.734 --> 30:38.670
{\an1}so I'd probably
wear gloves.

30:38.736 --> 30:40.338
So, Cory's in my way.

30:40.405 --> 30:43.241
{\an8}Murray is not being
half as affectionate

30:43.308 --> 30:44.876
{\an8}as he would normally be.

30:44.943 --> 30:48.713
And I want to fast-track
the answers with him

30:48.780 --> 30:50.882
because it's a little bit
gray right now.

30:50.949 --> 30:53.585
So, I want to vote for him.

30:53.651 --> 30:55.086
I got your back 110%.

30:55.153 --> 30:56.788
But y'all, just make sure
we go pack our stuff,

30:56.854 --> 30:58.489
{\an5}just in case.

30:56.854 --> 30:58.489
I haven't even unpacked.

30:58.556 --> 31:00.825
{\an1}Anybody else getting bothered
by anybody else?

31:00.892 --> 31:02.393
I mean, I'm bothered by DD.

31:02.460 --> 31:05.196
I still think that DD serves
some sort of purpose here.

31:05.263 --> 31:07.031
Personally, like,
I love you, I'm just torn.

31:07.098 --> 31:10.635
Like, I'm not 100% sure
what I'm going to do.

31:10.702 --> 31:12.003
Who do you think?

31:12.070 --> 31:13.905
{\an1}Hey, I'm here for you guys.
Whatever y'all want.

31:13.972 --> 31:15.406
I'm just saying,
but you won't shake on the...

31:15.473 --> 31:16.908
like, or no?

31:16.975 --> 31:18.810
Doesn't matter.

31:18.876 --> 31:21.446
Cast your vote
for yourself.

31:21.512 --> 31:24.015
I think that Kareem
actually should leave,

31:24.082 --> 31:25.817
because I don't
want you here.

31:25.883 --> 31:27.018
She is with Malcolm.

31:27.085 --> 31:28.820
{\an8}You should go back
in the water.

31:32.357 --> 31:33.691
Cheyenne wants Cory,

31:33.758 --> 31:35.493
because he feels like Cory
is getting in the way

31:35.560 --> 31:37.895
of him and Murray.

31:37.962 --> 31:39.330
{\an8}Why aren't (bleep)--

31:39.397 --> 31:41.633
{\an8}Oh, okay, Kareem actually
(bleep) cooks and cleans.

31:41.699 --> 31:44.235
{\an5}I know he cooks and cleans.

31:41.699 --> 31:44.235
Diandra does nothing.

31:44.302 --> 31:46.237
(announcer)
Looks like Farrah's voting

31:46.304 --> 31:48.139
on who can make
her life easier

31:48.206 --> 31:50.742
rather than voting with logic.

31:50.808 --> 31:52.410
{\an8}Typical.

31:52.477 --> 31:53.711
So, there you go.

31:53.778 --> 31:56.214
Diandra keeps affecting
both my girls,

31:56.281 --> 31:59.050
{\an8}Maya and Janelle,
so she gets my cut.

32:00.518 --> 32:02.086
{\an5}(Nicole)
I think going
into this elimination,

32:02.153 --> 32:03.821
people are gonna be very
shocked and surprised

32:03.888 --> 32:05.223
as to what happens,

32:05.290 --> 32:07.058
{\an8}because nobody knows
where anybody lies.

32:07.125 --> 32:08.359
I don't feel like
any of us are safe.

32:08.426 --> 32:11.462
♪♪

32:16.367 --> 32:19.504
♪♪

32:25.543 --> 32:26.844
(sighs)

32:26.911 --> 32:29.547
{\an8}Me protecting Nurys
and Diandra all the time,

32:29.614 --> 32:31.349
{\an8}I'm kinda putting Maya
on the back burner.

32:31.416 --> 32:34.419
And I just want Maya
to know that moving forward

32:34.485 --> 32:37.288
she's my only priority.

32:40.224 --> 32:41.693
All right.

32:44.562 --> 32:46.197
You're obviously messing up

32:46.264 --> 32:47.799
{\an1}future relationships
that I may have.

32:47.865 --> 32:50.668
{\an7}It's time for you to go,
so cut vote on me.

32:52.303 --> 32:54.238
Cory, cut.

32:59.877 --> 33:01.913
Girl, I already hit you
with the rubber duck.

33:01.979 --> 33:04.215
{\an5}(squeak)
Now, you about
to get hit with a cut.

33:04.282 --> 33:05.316
(squeak)

33:05.383 --> 33:06.718
Thank you.

33:22.367 --> 33:25.503
{\an5}(Kareem)
A part of me doesn't feel
like I am up for elimination,

33:25.570 --> 33:27.004
{\an8}but I'm a little bit nervous.

33:27.071 --> 33:29.507
{\an8}I definitely still feel
like I still have things to,

33:29.574 --> 33:31.509
{\an8}you know, fix between
me and Maya.

33:31.576 --> 33:33.845
{\an8}This elimination, I'm nervous.

33:33.911 --> 33:35.813
It's a good chance
I could be going home

33:35.880 --> 33:38.282
because Cheyenne wants
to be with Murray.

33:38.349 --> 33:40.051
What up, what up?

33:40.118 --> 33:42.186
(cheering and applause)

33:42.253 --> 33:45.456
{\an8}Welcome to the second
elimination.

33:45.523 --> 33:48.292
Tonight I'm gonna
call the exes forward

33:48.359 --> 33:50.528
to count your Cut
or Crush votes.

33:50.595 --> 33:52.697
Now, y'all know what
a Crush vote means, right?

33:52.764 --> 33:54.265
That cancels out
a Cut vote.

33:54.332 --> 33:56.634
And the ex with
the most Cut votes,

33:56.701 --> 33:58.803
well, that mean
you're going home.

33:58.870 --> 34:01.038
If the vote ends up
in a tie,

34:01.105 --> 34:05.109
the power will revert
to the remaining exes.

34:05.176 --> 34:08.646
The whole reason we're here
is to answer the question,

34:08.713 --> 34:12.216
can you ever really
be over your ex?

34:12.283 --> 34:14.452
By the end
of this experience,

34:14.518 --> 34:17.755
we will know
if you've moved on.

34:17.822 --> 34:19.791
Some of you may find
new love,

34:19.857 --> 34:22.760
rekindle with
an old love,

34:22.827 --> 34:24.762
or just say,
"(bleep) love."

34:24.829 --> 34:26.197
(laughter)

34:26.264 --> 34:28.966
Well, I guess it's time
for the business at hand.

34:29.033 --> 34:30.333
Bam, it just got hot.

34:30.400 --> 34:32.402
All right, well,
let's get to it.

34:32.469 --> 34:36.706
Sha, Jay, Murray,
Nurys, Nelson,

34:36.774 --> 34:38.275
you have nothing
in your pineapple,

34:38.342 --> 34:39.744
which means
you're safe.

34:39.811 --> 34:41.813
Wipe that sweat from
your forehead, okay?

34:41.879 --> 34:43.581
{\an3}You good.

34:44.549 --> 34:46.217
{\an3}Diandra...

34:46.284 --> 34:47.952
please step up
to your pineapple.

34:48.018 --> 34:49.654
Excuse me.

34:52.590 --> 34:53.724
How you feeling
right now?

34:53.791 --> 34:55.726
{\an5}Nervous, like always.

34:53.791 --> 34:55.726
{\an3}Nervous?

34:55.793 --> 34:58.129
Are you ready
to get to it?

34:58.196 --> 35:00.398
{\an4}Yeah.

34:58.196 --> 35:00.398
{\an3}All right.

35:03.568 --> 35:05.436
{\an8}You definitely
got some chips.

35:07.071 --> 35:08.139
{\an8}First one, Cut.

35:09.307 --> 35:10.608
{\an8}Second chip...

35:11.742 --> 35:12.743
{\an9}Cut.

35:16.581 --> 35:18.649
{\an8}And that's it.
You got two Cut votes,

35:18.716 --> 35:21.419
{\an8}which means you are in
the hot seat right now.

35:21.486 --> 35:23.488
{\an7}Okay.

35:21.486 --> 35:23.488
{\an8}So, take a seat.

35:26.090 --> 35:27.692
{\an3}Cory Z.

35:26.090 --> 35:27.692
{\an1}Oh, boy.

35:27.758 --> 35:28.993
Please step up
to your pineapple.

35:29.060 --> 35:30.695
And you hit him
on the shoulder

35:30.761 --> 35:32.196
like it's the walk of doom
or something, man.

35:32.263 --> 35:33.798
{\an5}I've been worried all day.

35:32.263 --> 35:33.798
Well, there's not many--

35:33.865 --> 35:35.233
there's not many
pineapples left.

35:35.299 --> 35:37.268
It's just me and Kareem.

35:37.335 --> 35:39.804
So, something in there.

35:42.106 --> 35:44.642
{\an8}Let's get to it.

35:44.709 --> 35:46.611
{\an8}You definitely have
some chips in here.

35:46.677 --> 35:48.946
{\an7}Mm-hmm.

35:46.677 --> 35:48.946
{\an8}First one...

35:50.114 --> 35:51.449
{\an9}Cut.

35:54.085 --> 35:55.553
{\an8}Chip number two.

35:56.521 --> 35:58.022
{\an9}Cut.

35:56.521 --> 35:58.022
{\an7}Yikes.

35:59.457 --> 36:00.791
{\an8}There's a third chip.

36:02.627 --> 36:04.061
{\an9}Cut.

36:02.627 --> 36:04.061
{\an7}Okay.

36:05.229 --> 36:06.531
{\an8}Hold on, you got more.

36:09.233 --> 36:10.635
{\an9}Cut.

36:11.903 --> 36:15.439
{\an8}Cory Z, you are now
in the hot seat

36:15.506 --> 36:17.208
{\an8}with four Cut votes.

36:17.275 --> 36:18.643
{\an7}Jeez.

36:18.709 --> 36:21.178
{\an1}Have a seat
and we'll see your outcome.

36:24.582 --> 36:26.651
Kareem, please step up
to your pineapple.

36:26.717 --> 36:29.220
{\an5}Whew, (bleep).

36:26.717 --> 36:29.220
Come on, five.

36:29.287 --> 36:30.821
Let's do this.

36:30.888 --> 36:32.356
{\an8}(Maya)
If I want to entertain
the Malcolm thing,

36:32.423 --> 36:33.524
{\an8}Kareem has to go,
because Kareem

36:33.591 --> 36:36.694
{\an8}clearly is a (bleep)blocker.

36:41.599 --> 36:43.501
{\an8}Definitely got
some chips.

36:45.503 --> 36:47.772
{\an8}First one, Cut.

36:49.307 --> 36:52.009
{\an8}Second one,
Cut.

36:53.344 --> 36:54.812
{\an9}Cut.

36:55.846 --> 36:57.682
{\an8}You got three cuts.

36:57.748 --> 37:00.851
{\an8}Which means,
if you have a Crush here,

37:00.918 --> 37:02.987
{\an8}that cancels out
a Cut vote.

37:03.054 --> 37:05.056
{\an8}But you got a Cut.

37:07.425 --> 37:08.759
{\an9}It's a tie.

37:10.261 --> 37:11.662
This is crazy.

37:20.271 --> 37:22.206
{\an5}(Romeo)
...couldn't come
to a decision.

37:22.273 --> 37:25.009
{\an8}The power goes
to the remaining exes.

37:25.076 --> 37:26.444
{\an8}Oh, my God.

37:26.510 --> 37:30.348
{\an8}I can't believe it.
It's a tie.

37:30.414 --> 37:33.250
{\an8}Now, the exes have the vote,
all bets are off.

37:33.317 --> 37:35.419
{\an8}I am shaking in my boots.

37:35.486 --> 37:38.089
{\an8}Please, get this boy
out of here.

37:38.155 --> 37:41.959
Cory Z, Kareem,
since you both tied

37:42.026 --> 37:45.930
with four Cut votes,
you cannot vote.

37:45.997 --> 37:48.766
If this thing ends up
in a tie again,

37:48.833 --> 37:51.102
both Cory Z and Kareem

37:51.168 --> 37:53.404
will be leaving
the house tonight.

37:57.041 --> 37:59.176
{\an8}All right, Jay,
you're up first.

37:59.243 --> 38:00.711
{\an8}Which ex do you
wanna cut?

38:00.778 --> 38:03.714
{\an8}I'm gonna throw
my cut on Cory.

38:05.650 --> 38:09.420
{\an8}Murray, which ex
do you wanna cut?

38:09.487 --> 38:11.622
{\an8}Um, I don't wanna be the one
that makes that decision,

38:11.689 --> 38:15.693
{\an8}so just to keep it even
and let you roommates decide,

38:15.760 --> 38:17.361
{\an8}I will do one for Kareem.

38:17.428 --> 38:19.530
{\an8}(Cheyenne)
What the (bleep)?

38:19.597 --> 38:23.768
{\an8}How come you did not
think of me in this moment?

38:23.834 --> 38:25.102
{\an9}Diandra?

38:25.169 --> 38:28.139
{\an8}I'm gonna have to throw
my Cut to Cory.

38:28.205 --> 38:31.008
{\an8}So... I'm sorry.

38:32.343 --> 38:35.479
{\an8}Sha, which ex
do you wanna cut?

38:35.546 --> 38:38.916
{\an8}I'm gonna go ahead
and make it even as well.

38:38.983 --> 38:40.284
{\an8}No hard feelings to you.

38:40.351 --> 38:42.453
{\an8}All right, so your Cut
goes to Kareem.

38:42.520 --> 38:43.754
{\an8}Yeah.

38:43.821 --> 38:46.624
{\an8}You're still tied.

38:46.691 --> 38:49.527
{\an8}Nurys, who needs to go?

38:49.593 --> 38:53.431
{\an8}Ah, (bleep), uh...
actually, I think

38:53.497 --> 38:55.232
{\an8}that my vote's gonna have
to go to Kareem.

38:55.299 --> 38:57.668
{\an8}Kareem.
So, three to two.

38:57.735 --> 38:59.370
{\an8}We got one more vote left.

38:59.437 --> 39:02.106
{\an8}Nelson, Nelson.

38:59.437 --> 39:02.106
{\an8}(chuckles)

39:02.173 --> 39:04.208
{\an8}You are the newest guy
in the house,

39:04.275 --> 39:06.944
{\an8}and it all
comes down to you.

39:07.011 --> 39:08.646
{\an8}You got all the power.

39:12.750 --> 39:15.252
{\an8}So, I'm gonna go ahead
and throw this as a tie

39:15.319 --> 39:16.587
{\an8}and send them both home.

39:16.654 --> 39:17.788
{\an9}(Jay)
Whoa!

39:17.855 --> 39:18.989
{\an7}(woman)
Ding, ding, ding, ding!

39:19.056 --> 39:21.325
{\an8}(man)
Savage, Nelson. Savage.

39:21.392 --> 39:24.195
{\an8}(Nelson)
Kareem, Maya wants
nothing to do with him.

39:24.261 --> 39:26.097
{\an8}He has no other connection
in the house.

39:26.163 --> 39:29.166
{\an5}And Cory Z is messing up
Cheyenne and Murray's
connection.

39:29.233 --> 39:30.501
So, you know what?

39:30.568 --> 39:32.737
Make room for more girls
to come into the house.

39:32.803 --> 39:35.773
{\an8}Kareem and Cory Z,
pack up your bags.

39:35.840 --> 39:38.075
{\an8}You're going home tonight.

39:38.142 --> 39:41.312
On that note,
Cory Z, Kareem,

39:41.378 --> 39:42.813
say your good-byes tonight.

39:42.880 --> 39:44.148
Pack your bags.

39:44.215 --> 39:46.350
You will no longer
be an ex on the beach.

39:48.052 --> 39:51.088
{\an5}(Maya)
I just feel like Kareem
came into this house

39:51.155 --> 39:53.591
{\an8}and created a mess on purpose.

39:53.657 --> 39:55.793
{\an8}And to me,
real love is respect,

39:55.860 --> 39:58.796
{\an8}and I don't see Kareem
genuinely loving me.

39:58.863 --> 40:00.765
So, good luck,

40:00.831 --> 40:03.501
and hopefully me and Malcolm
can move forward.

40:03.567 --> 40:05.703
Enjoy your night,
and for some of you,

40:05.770 --> 40:09.306
I will see you
at the beach real soon.

40:11.041 --> 40:12.309
(Murray)
I do like Cory Z in the house,

40:12.376 --> 40:13.644
{\an8}and I think there's a lot

40:13.711 --> 40:15.446
{\an8}of unfinished business
between us.

40:15.513 --> 40:18.449
{\an8}But Cory Z leaving
definitely opens up that door

40:18.516 --> 40:20.985
{\an8}for me and Cheyenne to have
a better connection emotionally.

40:21.051 --> 40:22.620
{\an8}So, it is much easier on me.

40:22.686 --> 40:25.823
Romeo out, baby.
Have a good night.

40:29.293 --> 40:31.462
{\an8}I'm kinda bummed and sad
after this elimination.

40:31.529 --> 40:33.664
{\an8}I mean, nobody wants to leave.

40:33.731 --> 40:35.666
{\an5}I know you're gonna
miss me the most.

40:33.731 --> 40:35.666
{\an1}I know.

40:35.733 --> 40:37.401
{\an5}(Cory Z)
Being here just opened up
that door again

40:37.468 --> 40:39.670
of me still having
feelings for Murray.

40:39.737 --> 40:41.605
And now, Cheyenne's gonna
have to find out

40:41.672 --> 40:43.541
that Murray is not
really into him the hard way,

40:43.607 --> 40:46.377
because he has a boyfriend
that he lives with.

40:46.443 --> 40:47.778
You think you're over your ex?

40:47.845 --> 40:50.080
Just live in a house with them
for days on end,

40:50.147 --> 40:51.348
and we'll see
if you really are.

40:51.415 --> 40:52.883
Because I wasn't.

40:52.950 --> 40:55.119
I came from the ocean,
and back to the ocean I go.

40:55.186 --> 40:57.454
Like the Little Mermaid.
Where's my prince?

40:59.323 --> 41:01.225
{\an8}I learned more
about myself here.

41:01.292 --> 41:03.694
{\an8}I made friends, and I grew.

41:03.761 --> 41:05.696
{\an8}Ultimately,
that's closure for me.

41:05.763 --> 41:07.531
Me and Maya learned more
about each other,

41:07.598 --> 41:09.934
and she also helped me
grow into a better man,

41:10.000 --> 41:12.336
so I thank her for that.

41:12.403 --> 41:14.705
I am no longer
an ex on the beach.

41:18.409 --> 41:22.580
{\an8}(announcer)
Next time on "Ex on the Beach,"

41:22.646 --> 41:26.450
it's the maniacal episode
everyone will be talking about.

41:26.517 --> 41:27.952
{\an1}You bitch!

41:28.018 --> 41:30.321
Janelle loses it on a housemate
in a jealous rage.

41:30.387 --> 41:31.355
{\an1}(Janelle)
You laughing, bitch?

41:31.422 --> 41:32.656
Lord!

41:32.723 --> 41:33.824
(announcer)
Farrah steps into the ring

41:33.891 --> 41:35.693
and hits Nurys
below the belt.

41:35.759 --> 41:38.462
And Jozea's desperate
with a capital "D."

41:38.529 --> 41:39.830
My heart pounding, bitch.

41:44.535 --> 41:47.471
{\an8}♪♪
