WEBVTT

00:01.601 --> 00:02.803
If BlueBell is where
you're gonna have

00:02.836 --> 00:06.174
your life, then this is where
I'm gonna be... in BlueBell.

00:06.207 --> 00:08.276
I don't have any
interest in being part
of an organization

00:08.309 --> 00:10.244
that would ask me
to remove gum from the sidewalk.

00:10.278 --> 00:12.046
I move for an emergency
recall vote,

00:12.080 --> 00:13.314
removing you, Crickett.

00:13.347 --> 00:16.117
I nominate AnnaBeth Nass
to take your place.

00:16.149 --> 00:18.052
I'm gonna nominate
a co-leader, Crickett Watts.

00:18.086 --> 00:19.553
I won't do it without her.

00:19.587 --> 00:21.789
Don't you idiots know
that I love you?!

00:21.822 --> 00:23.157
Ooh!

00:23.191 --> 00:24.825
(loud crash, scream)

00:24.858 --> 00:26.127
A broken hip.

00:26.160 --> 00:28.162
One of us needs
to go down there

00:28.196 --> 00:29.797
and take care of her.
Bye-bye, baby.

00:29.830 --> 00:32.200
I'll miss you.

00:35.203 --> 00:37.371
BRICK:
 Come on, Magnolia, your
 sister's finally coming home.

00:37.405 --> 00:40.608
Hey, now, what do you think?

00:40.641 --> 00:43.544
Should we add some stickers,
maybe some glitter?

00:43.577 --> 00:46.414
Yeah, glitter will make up
for the fact that you forced

00:46.447 --> 00:48.449
Lemon into a life as a mean
old lady's slave.

00:48.482 --> 00:50.684
There was no forcing.
We flipped a coin, she lost.

00:50.718 --> 00:52.086
It was fair!
Well, then why

00:52.120 --> 00:54.222
are you so worried
about her coming back?

00:54.255 --> 00:57.591
It's just, we talked every day
for months,

00:57.625 --> 01:02.163
and then suddenly,
three weeks ago, total silence?!

01:02.196 --> 01:05.533
And-and she told me she was
coming home tonight in a text.

01:05.566 --> 01:07.435
She didn't even use emojis.

01:07.468 --> 01:08.669
Maybe she snapped.

01:08.702 --> 01:10.738
Like that guy on Homeland
who was stuck in the cell

01:10.771 --> 01:12.640
all those years and wants
to blow everyone up.

01:12.673 --> 01:14.275
I haven't seen Homeland.
Does he do it?

01:14.308 --> 01:16.144
Ah! Don't tell me.

01:16.177 --> 01:17.478
All I can say
is you better be

01:17.511 --> 01:19.747
planning one hell
of a welcome back party.

01:19.780 --> 01:20.914
A party?

01:20.948 --> 01:23.717
You're not just giving her
this crappy banner, are you?

01:24.885 --> 01:27.087
Daddy?

01:29.623 --> 01:31.292
Thanks.

01:32.326 --> 01:33.294
A new dishwasher.

01:33.327 --> 01:35.429
So what was it this time?
Did your mom hear

01:35.463 --> 01:37.331
that we had dinner
with Winnie?

01:37.365 --> 01:38.366
Brunch with Brando?

01:38.399 --> 01:39.733
She caught me texting Vivian.

01:39.767 --> 01:40.768
(sighs)

01:40.801 --> 01:43.571
All right, now, okay,
see, we-we are drowning

01:43.604 --> 01:44.672
in ulterior motive
appliances.

01:44.705 --> 01:46.474
You got to tell your mom
she won.

01:46.507 --> 01:48.409
Tell her we love her more
than the Wilkes

01:48.442 --> 01:49.610
and she can go home now.

01:49.643 --> 01:52.246
I know. It-It's just kind
of flattering

01:52.280 --> 01:54.215
to have her so focused on me.

01:54.248 --> 01:56.484
Usually, she just pays attention
to her clients.

01:56.517 --> 01:59.520
Like when I was ten.
She left me with a
nanny for a month

01:59.553 --> 02:01.522
while she dealt
with Alec Baldwin's divorce.

02:01.555 --> 02:02.923
Or that time
she missed Christmas

02:02.956 --> 02:05.193
'cause she was dealing with
Britney's first meltdown?

02:05.226 --> 02:06.460
I remember things.

02:06.494 --> 02:08.162
Exactly. The only other time

02:08.196 --> 02:09.930
I was the focus
of this much attention

02:09.963 --> 02:12.166
was when I ran
for fifth grade treasurer.

02:12.200 --> 02:13.334
She handled my campaign.

02:13.367 --> 02:14.868
"Be in the know-y,
vote for Zoe."

02:14.902 --> 02:17.705
World's greatest publicist
comes up with "know-y"?

02:17.738 --> 02:19.307
Hey, she knew her audience.
I won.

02:19.340 --> 02:21.575
That's great, but this is not
the fifth grade,

02:21.609 --> 02:23.277
and she's not doing
this for you, Zoe.

02:23.311 --> 02:24.512
She's not spending
time with you,

02:24.545 --> 02:25.579
she's buying you things

02:25.613 --> 02:27.781
to prove that she's better
than your other family.

02:27.815 --> 02:29.883
And it's-it's suffocating!

02:29.917 --> 02:31.585
Do you know
something else?
She's also very

02:31.619 --> 02:33.454
critical of me. "Get Lasik.

02:33.487 --> 02:35.856
Try to develop
a less nasally voice."

02:35.889 --> 02:38.259
Please, you've got to ask her
to leave.

02:38.292 --> 02:39.460
(door bangs)

02:39.493 --> 02:42.330
And that, I've had 22 heart
attacks since she got here.

02:42.363 --> 02:45.433
I bought you a robot vacuum.

02:45.466 --> 02:47.435
I bet no one else has done that.

02:47.468 --> 02:49.303
Joel, really?

02:49.337 --> 02:50.838
When's the last time
you did cardio?

02:52.573 --> 02:54.542
Remember that thing we were
talking about earlier?

02:54.575 --> 02:56.510
I'll handle it today.

02:57.511 --> 03:00.381
Don Todd coming to you
from the Sahara Desert.

03:00.414 --> 03:02.816
Or as I like to call it,

03:02.850 --> 03:04.785
"The world's
third-biggest sand trap."

03:04.818 --> 03:06.387
It's definitely the hottest.

03:06.420 --> 03:09.923
Today we're gonna look...
Oh, my God, that's hot!

03:09.957 --> 03:11.259
Are you kidding me?!

03:11.292 --> 03:13.427
Are you kidding me?!
Good God!

03:13.461 --> 03:16.264
Man, it has gotta be
120 degrees there.

03:16.297 --> 03:18.566
Is there any chance
Don Todd is bionic?

03:18.599 --> 03:19.567
Maybe.

03:19.600 --> 03:22.236
At 4:00 this morning,
I saw him sink a putt

03:22.270 --> 03:24.405
while riding a ATV
over a cliff.

03:24.438 --> 03:26.307
The episode before that
was even better.

03:26.340 --> 03:28.676
I didn't even know quicksand
was real.

03:28.709 --> 03:30.511
What are you guys doing
watching Don Todd

03:30.544 --> 03:31.712
in the middle of the night?

03:31.745 --> 03:32.780
BOTH:
Can't sleep.

03:32.813 --> 03:33.881
Why not?

03:33.914 --> 03:35.449
Still sad about A.B.

03:35.483 --> 03:36.617
Can't stop thinking
about Tansy.

03:36.650 --> 03:38.552
Who'd have thunk,
of the three of us,

03:38.586 --> 03:40.288
I'd be the only one
with a girlfriend?

03:40.321 --> 03:41.755
(chuckles)

03:41.789 --> 03:43.023
We don't need girls.

03:43.056 --> 03:44.592
We got Don Todd.

03:44.625 --> 03:46.327
Well, as viable a life option

03:46.360 --> 03:47.828
as your man-love
for Don Todd is,

03:47.861 --> 03:50.864
I might suggest using
the time for a town
fire drill.

03:50.898 --> 03:52.600
We haven't had one
in five months,

03:52.633 --> 03:55.403
and it reflects
poorly on me as
safety captain.

03:55.436 --> 03:57.705
We haven't had one because
everybody knows the drill:

03:57.738 --> 03:59.473
you walk outside.

03:59.507 --> 04:01.742
Fine. The ancient Pompeiians
didn't want

04:01.775 --> 04:04.011
an eruption drill either.
Look what happened to them.

04:04.044 --> 04:06.480
DON TODD: ...as you turn through
the shot.
Oh, baby! You see that?

04:06.514 --> 04:08.349
Don Todd! Whoo!

04:08.382 --> 04:10.984
Oh, hey, gorgeous,
what are you doing here? Mwa!

04:11.018 --> 04:12.252
Harley's with his dad tonight.

04:12.286 --> 04:15.289
And so I was thinking I would
just blow off bills and cleaning

04:15.323 --> 04:16.656
if you want to hang out.

04:16.690 --> 04:18.024
Oh, great. You know,
Lemon's actually having

04:18.058 --> 04:19.327
her welcome home
party tonight.

04:19.360 --> 04:20.994
Now I don't have
to look for a date.

04:21.028 --> 04:24.532
Lemon's dad and my uncle used
to share the practice, you know?

04:24.565 --> 04:26.033
And so Lemon and I were forced

04:26.066 --> 04:28.035
to spend a lot of time together
as kids.

04:28.068 --> 04:31.905
And there was
this one time when I put
a bug in her cheese sandwich,

04:31.939 --> 04:33.073
and she never forgave me.

04:33.106 --> 04:34.775
Oh, you know, that is so weird,

04:34.808 --> 04:36.744
'cause, actually, Harley,
the other day, put a spider

04:36.777 --> 04:38.846
in my French fries.
And now I see it's just

04:38.879 --> 04:40.047
running in the family.

04:40.080 --> 04:42.049
I didn't know he did that.
I tell you what.

04:42.082 --> 04:44.885
Why don't you skip the party,
go home and clean your house,

04:44.918 --> 04:46.654
and I'll come by after,

04:46.687 --> 04:48.856
and we can, you know,
dirty it up again.

04:48.889 --> 04:49.857
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.

04:49.890 --> 04:50.891
I like that.
Uh-huh.

04:52.726 --> 04:53.761
Mmm....

04:57.130 --> 05:00.434
Y'all are just sad.
(laughs)

05:04.037 --> 05:06.039
Next, we need to talk about
how to divide the prep

05:06.073 --> 05:07.007
for the Sadie Hawkins Dance.

05:07.040 --> 05:09.677
Oh, I've already booked
a band, got a caterer,

05:09.710 --> 05:10.944
and ordered
200 bales of hay.

05:10.978 --> 05:13.781
I love having
a heartbroken co-leader!

05:13.814 --> 05:15.649
(laughs)
So, have you told

05:15.683 --> 05:18.386
Lemon about your new role
in the Belles?

05:18.419 --> 05:19.787
Well...

05:19.820 --> 05:21.455
Oh, my gosh!
You haven't told her!

05:21.489 --> 05:24.392
Only because I haven't been able
to get her on the phone!

05:24.425 --> 05:26.660
Or because you don't want
to tell her you betrayed her!

05:27.628 --> 05:29.430
Ooh, just who I'm looking for.

05:29.463 --> 05:32.099
I'm having a little dinner party
tonight to welcome Lemon home,

05:32.132 --> 05:34.602
and I expect you,
her best friend, to be there.

05:34.635 --> 05:35.969
Oh, and Crickett,

05:36.003 --> 05:37.805
as you were only her
sometimes friend,

05:37.838 --> 05:39.807
I will leave it
to your discretion.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.775
But I will see you tonight!

05:41.809 --> 05:43.744
Of course! Fun!

05:43.777 --> 05:44.812
(chuckles)

05:46.680 --> 05:48.682
I found the most
amazing double oven

05:48.716 --> 05:50.518
for your new house.

05:50.551 --> 05:51.885
Six burners,
built-in griddle...

05:51.919 --> 05:55.022
Mom, you don't need
to keep buying my love
with high-end appliances.

05:55.055 --> 05:56.890
I'm not buying
your love.

05:56.924 --> 05:58.626
It's just when you
get together

05:58.659 --> 06:00.093
with the Wilkes
for game night

06:00.127 --> 06:02.596
or whatever folksy thing
you do together,

06:02.630 --> 06:05.433
I want them to know
that your mother cares.

06:05.466 --> 06:07.535
Trust me, they do.
I do.

06:07.568 --> 06:09.403
Everyone knows
that you care.

06:09.437 --> 06:10.671
But don't you think
it's time for you

06:10.704 --> 06:13.774
to get back to doing
what you do: working?

06:13.807 --> 06:15.008
To be honest with you,

06:15.042 --> 06:17.645
I have been thinking
the exact same thing.

06:17.678 --> 06:19.480
Seriously?
That is such a relief.

06:19.513 --> 06:21.849
I am taking you on
as a client

06:21.882 --> 06:24.585
and getting your
practice back.

06:24.618 --> 06:26.053
Wait, what?

06:27.821 --> 06:29.823
I refuse to stand by
and let Brick

06:29.857 --> 06:32.593
take advantage
of my only daughter.

06:32.626 --> 06:34.628
I'm gonna help
you win.

06:34.662 --> 06:35.829
Like the fifth grade election?

06:35.863 --> 06:37.397
Exactly.

06:38.231 --> 06:39.332
(laughs)

06:41.735 --> 06:45.906
All right, Lemon is gonna be
here at 7:00, so everyone,

06:45.939 --> 06:47.875
find a place
to hide for the surprise.

06:47.908 --> 06:49.943
Let's go! Let's go!

06:50.811 --> 06:51.879
Oh.

06:53.947 --> 06:54.948
(grunts)

07:00.721 --> 07:02.155
Oh! Hey, AnnaBeth.

07:02.189 --> 07:03.824
Hello, Lavon.

07:03.857 --> 07:04.792
(chuckles)

07:04.825 --> 07:07.528
So I heard you, uh,
you took over the Belles.

07:07.561 --> 07:08.996
Mm-hmm.
That's good.

07:09.029 --> 07:10.731
Mm-hmm.
Maybe one of us should...

07:10.764 --> 07:11.899
I was here first.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.100
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

07:21.174 --> 07:23.744
Hey, Brick, do you-do you think
we might be able

07:23.777 --> 07:25.513
to come out now?

07:25.546 --> 07:27.815
'Cause I can only feel,
like, four of my toes.

07:27.848 --> 07:29.950
Yeah, I guess so.

07:29.983 --> 07:31.585
This is just
not like her.

07:31.619 --> 07:33.554
She must be even angrier
than I thought.

07:33.587 --> 07:36.690
Of course she's angry,
not just at you!

07:36.724 --> 07:37.891
At all of you!

07:37.925 --> 07:39.827
Have you even
visited my sister?

07:39.860 --> 07:43.597
You've had town event
after town event, girlfriends,

07:43.631 --> 07:44.965
boyfriends, cabarets,
Belle takeovers,
all while

07:44.998 --> 07:47.234
Lemon was essentially in prison.
I don't blame her

07:47.267 --> 07:48.802
if she never comes back!

07:48.836 --> 07:50.671
(phone rings)

07:50.704 --> 07:52.472
(all murmuring)

07:54.307 --> 07:55.242
Hey, where are you?

07:55.275 --> 07:57.945
Wade, I need you to come get me
right away.

07:57.978 --> 07:59.947
And don't tell anyone
where you are going.

07:59.980 --> 08:02.015
I won't say a word, but I got
to know where I'm going.

08:02.049 --> 08:04.918
Fayette County Jail.

08:04.952 --> 08:07.721
Well, what do you know?

08:07.755 --> 08:09.089
Lemon is the new black.

08:13.894 --> 08:15.696
(gasps)

08:20.000 --> 08:21.134
(sighs)

08:21.168 --> 08:23.737
(car horn honks)

08:23.771 --> 08:25.839
(seagulls calling)

08:25.873 --> 08:27.975
(birds singing)

08:35.849 --> 08:37.551
Just need to file
the paperwork,

08:37.585 --> 08:39.019
and she's all yours.

08:39.052 --> 08:42.155
Oh, thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you!

08:42.188 --> 08:45.693
Oh, your skin is filmy.
Have you showered?

08:45.726 --> 08:47.895
Yeah, Lemon, right in between
exits 47 and 48,

08:47.928 --> 08:49.029
I pulled off the highway

08:49.062 --> 08:50.731
and took a nice
long bubble bath.

08:50.764 --> 08:52.332
I'm sorry.
It was very kind of you

08:52.365 --> 08:54.034
to come all the way to get me.

08:54.067 --> 08:56.269
I mean, obviously, I couldn't
let anyone else know I was here.

08:56.303 --> 08:58.071
Yeah, well, about that.

08:58.105 --> 08:59.573
Lemon, I gotta ask.

08:59.607 --> 09:00.741
Did you kill your grandma?

09:00.774 --> 09:02.342
(scoffs)
Very funny.

09:02.375 --> 09:04.745
Though I can't say the
thought didn't cross my mind.

09:04.778 --> 09:07.815
Then, how did you,
Lemon Breeland, end up in jail?

09:07.848 --> 09:10.784
Well, that
is a very long story.

09:10.818 --> 09:14.321
Fortunately, they're not
very speedy around here,

09:14.354 --> 09:16.924
so settle in.

09:18.659 --> 09:19.492
I cannot believe this!

09:19.526 --> 09:21.629
You said you were
gonna take care of it!

09:21.662 --> 09:23.831
I was ready to drive her
to the airport today!

09:23.864 --> 09:27.067
Well, my mom is taking me
on as a client, you know?

09:27.100 --> 09:28.802
So for the first time
in my life,

09:28.836 --> 09:31.639
she's gonna prioritize me over
Jen Aniston's pregnancy rumors.

09:31.672 --> 09:33.340
And she's gonna get me
the practice back.

09:33.373 --> 09:35.108
Are you kidding me?
You've been trying this

09:35.142 --> 09:36.677
for a year,
and Brick hasn't budged.

09:36.710 --> 09:38.211
Well, he hasn't faced
my publicity machine yet.

09:38.245 --> 09:40.213
She's gonna get the people
of BlueBell to see

09:40.247 --> 09:41.281
how dedicated
I am to them.

09:41.314 --> 09:44.017
And they're gonna demand
that Brick let me back in.

09:44.051 --> 09:45.318
They already know that!

09:45.352 --> 09:48.288
Bup, bup, bup, bup!
Even if I don't get
the practice back,

09:48.321 --> 09:51.091
my mother has scheduled
a strategy meeting
with me this morning,

09:51.124 --> 09:53.326
and she only has strategy
meetings with her top clients.

09:53.360 --> 09:55.328
So, win-win.

09:55.362 --> 09:57.230
(door bangs)

09:57.264 --> 09:59.299
You know,
some people, um,
they-they grab the door,

09:59.332 --> 10:01.034
and they just gently
close it behind them.

10:01.068 --> 10:02.335
Great news, honey.

10:02.369 --> 10:04.337
I got you an interview
with the local press.

10:04.371 --> 10:07.407
Dash DeWitt is meeting
you at the Butter Stick at noon.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.309
Dash? That's...

10:09.342 --> 10:11.344
Since-Since when
is that a "get"?

10:11.378 --> 10:14.047
It's too obvious to go national
with a small town story.

10:14.081 --> 10:16.750
It looks planted.
The play is, you go local,

10:16.784 --> 10:19.052
then let it get picked up
by the bigger outlets.

10:19.086 --> 10:20.954
Yeah, Joel,
that's the play.

10:20.988 --> 10:24.858
Trust me, I rep the doctor
trifecta: Oz, Phil, and Gupta.

10:24.892 --> 10:27.160
I dropped Drew
'cause he's a whiner.

10:27.194 --> 10:28.829
I'm so excited.
Thank you, Mommy!

10:30.197 --> 10:31.932
So, taking care
of Grandma Bettie

10:31.965 --> 10:34.267
was pretty much
what you'd expect.

10:34.301 --> 10:38.038
Oh, soup again?

10:38.071 --> 10:41.141
I have a bad hip,
not the common cold.

10:41.174 --> 10:43.944
Temperature in here must be
a thousand degrees.

10:43.977 --> 10:45.278
Fan me, honey, fan me.

10:45.312 --> 10:47.781
Oh.

10:49.717 --> 10:51.919
It's time for my sponge bath.

10:53.320 --> 10:55.155
Lemon...

10:55.188 --> 10:56.690
Lemon?

10:56.724 --> 10:57.691
Lemon!

10:57.725 --> 10:59.026
(yelps)

10:59.059 --> 11:00.761
Heinous, horrific.

11:00.794 --> 11:02.696
And I was so lonely.

11:02.730 --> 11:04.464
Waiting for visitors
from BlueBell,

11:04.497 --> 11:05.766
who never came.

11:05.799 --> 11:07.200
Look, Lemon,
I'm sorry, all right?

11:07.234 --> 11:09.302
The truth is
I was seeing somebo...

11:09.336 --> 11:10.470
I mean, the only person
I had to talk to

11:10.503 --> 11:11.739
was Grandma Bettie's chauffeur,

11:11.772 --> 11:13.006
and barely spoke any English.

11:13.040 --> 11:15.175
He would just murmur
sympathetically.

11:15.208 --> 11:18.245
All right, guilt trip received
loud and clear.

11:18.278 --> 11:19.913
Oh, no, no, no. No guilt.

11:19.947 --> 11:21.782
Because one miraculous day,

11:21.815 --> 11:24.051
a vision

11:24.084 --> 11:26.920
appeared in pinstripes.

11:32.359 --> 11:33.426
Well.

11:33.460 --> 11:35.462
Hello there.

11:35.495 --> 11:37.230
Carter Covington.

11:37.264 --> 11:38.832
Am I hallucinating?

11:38.866 --> 11:40.500
Oh, I came to call
on Mrs. Breeland.

11:40.533 --> 11:42.435
And it seems

11:42.469 --> 11:44.171
to offer you my jacket.

11:44.204 --> 11:46.940
Don't want you to catch a chill.

11:46.974 --> 11:48.275
(laughs)

11:52.379 --> 11:55.315
(laughs)

11:55.348 --> 11:57.417
Carter Covington?

11:57.450 --> 12:00.854
Of the Birmingham Covingtons?

12:00.888 --> 12:02.823
Aw, man, you must've
been lonely.

12:02.856 --> 12:05.392
Okay, you know what, he was
an angel, all right?

12:05.425 --> 12:07.394
He even forgave me for
that horrid debacle

12:07.427 --> 12:08.896
of my first date,

12:08.929 --> 12:11.431
and whisked me off
to dinner and society events.

12:11.464 --> 12:13.500
Wade, he saved my life.

12:13.533 --> 12:15.803
Yeah, maybe your grandma's, too.

12:15.836 --> 12:18.238
Okay, you're free to go.

12:18.271 --> 12:19.973
Give me all your money.

12:20.007 --> 12:21.208
Does that phrase
have anything

12:21.241 --> 12:22.409
to do with
why you ended up here?

12:22.442 --> 12:23.443
Give it to me!

12:27.815 --> 12:30.250
My grandma can never ever know

12:30.283 --> 12:31.351
that you saw me.

12:31.384 --> 12:32.352
Understand?

12:32.385 --> 12:33.954
Mm-hmm.

12:38.091 --> 12:40.093
TODD:
Something I like to do here
on the course

12:40.127 --> 12:41.261
is drink six or seven

12:41.294 --> 12:42.429
of the local coffees,

12:42.462 --> 12:44.998
and dare my hands not to shake.

12:45.032 --> 12:47.300
It trains the mind.

12:47.334 --> 12:49.536
'Cause like I always
like to say,

12:49.569 --> 12:52.072
"The mind is
the most important club

12:52.105 --> 12:54.574
in the bag of your head."

12:54.607 --> 12:56.376
Yeah, Magnolia was right.

12:56.409 --> 12:58.846
I mean, I was so consumed
with the stupid merger.

12:58.879 --> 13:00.413
And Lemon was the one
who saved the town.

13:00.447 --> 13:03.150
I could've at least sent her
a ba-balloon bouquet.

13:03.183 --> 13:04.852
Yeah, I didn't
reach out, either.

13:04.885 --> 13:07.220
I was, you know,
so busy with Lynly.

13:07.254 --> 13:09.456
And then busy
with Tansy...

13:09.489 --> 13:10.858
I would urge you
to stop talking.

13:10.891 --> 13:11.859
Yup.

13:11.892 --> 13:13.026
I visited once.

13:13.060 --> 13:14.862
It was like
the all-female version

13:14.895 --> 13:16.997
of Who's Afraid
 of Virginia Woolf.

13:17.030 --> 13:18.999
I lasted 20 minutes,
never went back.

13:19.032 --> 13:20.500
Well, you're all in luck.

13:20.533 --> 13:22.402
Lemon texted me and she's
coming back tonight.

13:22.435 --> 13:24.137
She texted you and not me?

13:24.171 --> 13:26.239
I better buy more glitter.

13:26.273 --> 13:28.108
I assume after last
night's debacle,

13:28.141 --> 13:30.010
you're upping your game
in the party department?

13:30.043 --> 13:32.412
Maybe some kind of
Gatsby jazz-age theme.

13:32.445 --> 13:34.347
Vintage flapper dresses,
wigs, jewels....

13:34.381 --> 13:37.217
(gasps)
Ooh, lots of young, single men.

13:37.250 --> 13:39.419
Now, is this what Lemon wants
or what Magnolia wants?

13:39.452 --> 13:42.155
No matter, this is
our chance for a do-over.

13:42.189 --> 13:43.523
Tonight we are pulling out

13:43.556 --> 13:44.524
all the stops.

13:44.557 --> 13:45.525
Can we get the Owl Club?

13:45.558 --> 13:47.094
Yeah, sure. I-I'll help.

13:47.127 --> 13:48.195
(cheers)
Oh, really?

13:48.228 --> 13:49.429
Our mayor can throw a party,

13:49.462 --> 13:51.298
but we can't have a
simple fire drill.

13:51.331 --> 13:53.033
For the 100th time, Tom...
Tom, no one likes it!

13:53.066 --> 13:54.101
No one wants it!
(all clamoring)

13:54.134 --> 13:56.136
Hey, hey!
Fire drill, come on!

14:00.440 --> 14:02.342
TODD:
Why would anyone come here?

14:02.375 --> 14:03.944
(chuckles)

14:03.977 --> 14:05.078
George?

14:05.112 --> 14:06.579
Old pal.

14:06.613 --> 14:08.415
You talking to me?

14:08.448 --> 14:09.917
I need some legal advise.

14:09.950 --> 14:11.451
And since we were nearly family

14:11.484 --> 14:13.620
until you left my sister
at the altar,

14:13.653 --> 14:14.687
I know I could count on you.

14:14.721 --> 14:16.990
All right, when are you people
gonna let go of that?

14:17.024 --> 14:18.425
So, a friend of mine--

14:18.458 --> 14:20.493
not me-- got kicked out
of boarding school,

14:20.527 --> 14:22.495
and she wonders
what she can do

14:22.529 --> 14:24.097
to appeal
the obvious mistake they made.

14:24.131 --> 14:25.432
Magnolia, seriously?

14:25.465 --> 14:27.434
Have you told
your father yet?

14:27.467 --> 14:28.635
Of course not!

14:28.668 --> 14:31.171
He'll kill me,
and I am too pretty to die.

14:31.204 --> 14:32.305
Well, I'm not gonna...

14:33.406 --> 14:35.308
All right, fine.

14:35.342 --> 14:36.910
I'll put in a call.

14:36.944 --> 14:38.245
See if they'll let you back in.

14:38.278 --> 14:40.213
But as soon as I do that,
we are telling Brick.

14:40.247 --> 14:41.381
Mmm, once you get me back in,

14:41.414 --> 14:42.382
there won't be
anything to tell him.

14:42.415 --> 14:43.550
Don't push it.

14:43.583 --> 14:46.219
Now, remember the point
of the interview

14:46.253 --> 14:47.988
is to highlight all
of the good things

14:48.021 --> 14:49.389
you've done for this town.

14:49.422 --> 14:51.992
Don't let Dash highjack
the interview.

14:52.025 --> 14:54.427
If you say something
you don't want in print,

14:54.461 --> 14:55.929
tell him it's off the record.

14:55.963 --> 14:57.530
And if all else fails,

14:57.564 --> 14:58.932
flirt like hell.

14:58.966 --> 15:01.668
I don't know that
that would work on Dash.

15:01.701 --> 15:04.004
Well, well, well.
Don't I know you?

15:04.037 --> 15:06.139
Or-or should I say "know-y."

15:06.173 --> 15:07.540
Did you want to make
an appointment?

15:07.574 --> 15:09.142
Because I am getting
pretty booked up.

15:09.176 --> 15:10.677
I assume this is
some sort of subtle effort

15:10.710 --> 15:12.679
to get your practice back.

15:12.712 --> 15:14.014
Well, if it's subtle,

15:14.047 --> 15:16.083
I'm definitely doing
something wrong.

15:16.116 --> 15:18.118
Oh, you are doing
several things wrong.

15:18.151 --> 15:21.354
That bench ad certainly
will get Zoe new patients.

15:21.388 --> 15:24.491
But more work for her,
more money for me.

15:24.524 --> 15:27.127
Until her non-compete clause

15:27.160 --> 15:29.096
is up in two months, and
then she will be taking

15:29.129 --> 15:30.630
all those new patients with her.

15:30.663 --> 15:32.532
Whoa, I didn't even
think of that.

15:32.565 --> 15:34.501
I mean, yeah, I am.

15:34.534 --> 15:35.969
Of course, you could avoid it

15:36.003 --> 15:38.638
if you just gave her
back her practice.

15:39.539 --> 15:42.209
I do not negotiate

15:42.242 --> 15:44.244
with terrorists.

15:45.545 --> 15:48.081
(phone chimes)
He's petrified.

15:49.349 --> 15:52.719
Oh, Anderson Cooper's having
a personal crisis.

15:52.752 --> 15:56.323
Well, he's just gonna have
to wait until we're done.

15:56.356 --> 15:58.291
You're putting me
above Anderson Cooper?

15:58.325 --> 15:59.659
This is important.

15:59.692 --> 16:02.129
No, I-I can't let you do that.

16:02.162 --> 16:04.964
You go.
I promise I can handle Dash.

16:05.665 --> 16:07.200
Dr. Zoe Hart.

16:07.234 --> 16:08.701
Tell me.

16:08.735 --> 16:11.204
What would you say is your
biggest medical accomplishment

16:11.238 --> 16:14.341
since you decided to move
back here to BlueBell?

16:14.374 --> 16:16.209
Oh, probably
the health initiative.

16:16.243 --> 16:19.212
I think I steered people onto
a path of lifetime benefits.

16:19.246 --> 16:20.213
Uh-huh.

16:20.247 --> 16:22.182
A whole month without cheese.

16:22.215 --> 16:24.084
It was not fun.

16:24.117 --> 16:26.719
But in the end, I suppose
I'm glad that we did it.

16:26.753 --> 16:28.588
See, I-I knew people
would feel that way.

16:28.621 --> 16:30.090
Did you now?
(chuckles)

16:30.123 --> 16:31.158
I had my doubts.

16:31.191 --> 16:33.593
Well, I was so confident,
that I even bet Brick

16:33.626 --> 16:35.495
I could get people down
to their target weight.

16:35.528 --> 16:37.164
Sadly, thanks to cake fest,

16:37.197 --> 16:38.598
I now work weekends.

16:38.631 --> 16:40.367
So, are you saying
that Health Month was

16:40.400 --> 16:42.502
all about a personal wager?

16:42.535 --> 16:44.471
(stammers)

16:44.504 --> 16:45.772
No, no, of course not.

16:45.805 --> 16:47.707
The health initiative was
in place first.

16:47.740 --> 16:50.043
I only bet Brick once I realized

16:50.077 --> 16:51.744
that I needed money
to remodel my house.

16:51.778 --> 16:53.046
So, you encouraged

16:53.080 --> 16:55.148
our beloved BlueBellians

16:55.182 --> 16:56.683
to starve themselves

16:56.716 --> 16:58.218
just so you could have

16:58.251 --> 16:59.686
a bigger closet?

16:59.719 --> 17:00.720
No... no!

17:00.753 --> 17:02.489
Well, I've seen
your wardrobe.

17:02.522 --> 17:04.691
You mean, you don't want
a bigger closet?

17:07.160 --> 17:09.162
Is it too late to say,
"off the record"?

17:10.396 --> 17:12.432
O-T-R?

17:12.464 --> 17:15.768
Carter was my knight
in shining armor.

17:15.801 --> 17:17.804
And even Grandma
Bettie approved.

17:17.837 --> 17:19.806
You have taken

17:19.839 --> 17:22.575
excellent care of me
for the past few weeks.

17:22.608 --> 17:23.776
Months.
And...

17:23.810 --> 17:24.777
now that you're dating

17:24.810 --> 17:26.579
the illustrious
Carter Covington,

17:26.613 --> 17:30.150
I finally have a Breeland
I don't have to be ashamed of.

17:30.183 --> 17:31.351
Now, I know

17:31.384 --> 17:32.519
that you're gonna want

17:32.552 --> 17:33.720
to make a fresh start

17:33.753 --> 17:35.555
when you return to BlueBell.

17:35.588 --> 17:37.524
So...

17:37.557 --> 17:40.427
I'm giving you the money
to buy Fancie's.

17:40.460 --> 17:42.495
Really?!

17:42.529 --> 17:43.530
WADE: Wow.

17:43.563 --> 17:44.797
Carter went away on business.

17:44.831 --> 17:46.433
And once again
I was all alone.

17:46.466 --> 17:49.202
So, that is
when I started spending time

17:49.236 --> 17:50.637
with Grandma Bettie's driver.

17:50.670 --> 17:52.172
Enrique.

17:52.205 --> 17:54.241
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

17:54.274 --> 17:56.643
Ah, he was fascinating.

17:56.676 --> 18:00.180
Poet, artist, musician.

18:00.213 --> 18:02.115
We both spoke
 the language of song.

18:02.149 --> 18:04.417
* Bésame *

18:04.451 --> 18:08.321
* Bésame mucho *

18:10.657 --> 18:13.626
* Como si fuera esta noche *

18:13.660 --> 18:15.895
* La última vez... *

18:15.928 --> 18:19.166
LEMON:
 We became friendly.

18:21.501 --> 18:23.503
Very friendly.

18:26.506 --> 18:28.841
Does Carter know about Enrique?

18:28.875 --> 18:30.743
Nope.

18:30.777 --> 18:32.912
Does Enrique
know about Carter?

18:32.945 --> 18:34.347
Nope.

18:34.381 --> 18:36.583
Lemon Breeland, you dog.

18:36.616 --> 18:38.618
I believe you have
two boyfriends.

18:38.651 --> 18:41.421
And it is amazing.

18:47.760 --> 18:48.861
You gambled on our health

18:48.895 --> 18:51.198
so you could get
a home renovation?

18:51.231 --> 18:52.765
Shame, Dr. Hart, shame!

18:52.799 --> 18:54.734
No! Dash took it out of context.

18:54.767 --> 18:56.369
It wasn't like that.

18:56.403 --> 18:58.305
I did Pilates for you!

18:58.338 --> 18:59.906
And your core has
never looked better.

18:59.939 --> 19:01.174
Traitor.

19:01.208 --> 19:02.909
Traitor!
Traitor!
Traitor!

19:02.942 --> 19:03.910
Traitor!

19:03.943 --> 19:05.945
Oh, my gosh, I screwed up!

19:05.978 --> 19:07.547
My mother is gonna drop me

19:07.580 --> 19:08.781
like Dr. Drew.

19:08.815 --> 19:09.816
Incoming, incoming.
Hmm?

19:09.849 --> 19:11.884
I don't know.

19:11.918 --> 19:14.854
Flirting with Dash couldn't have
made the interview any worse.

19:14.887 --> 19:16.389
I-I am so sorry.

19:16.423 --> 19:18.491
I promise
it will never happen again.

19:18.525 --> 19:19.792
You are right.

19:19.826 --> 19:23.430
Because from now on,
I'm not leaving your side.

19:23.463 --> 19:24.831
What? Really?

19:24.864 --> 19:26.065
We are gonna do to Brick

19:26.098 --> 19:28.801
what we did to Matthew Greenberg
in the fifth grade election.

19:28.835 --> 19:30.437
What did you do
to Matthew Greenberg?

19:30.470 --> 19:32.405
We got a reporter
from the school paper

19:32.439 --> 19:33.573
to ask him if he was behind

19:33.606 --> 19:35.808
the big Beanie Baby
stealing incident.

19:35.842 --> 19:38.278
He wasn't,
but the more we asked him,

19:38.311 --> 19:39.679
the more
everybody believed it.

19:39.712 --> 19:41.648
He finally had
to transfer schools.

19:42.982 --> 19:44.851
Okay, well, you, um...

19:44.884 --> 19:45.885
Good luck with that.

19:45.918 --> 19:48.221
Um, I am gonna go do some work.

19:48.255 --> 19:49.956
Or maybe jog?

19:51.791 --> 19:53.693
Mom, I-I thought our strategy

19:53.726 --> 19:55.895
was to get people
to appreciate my work?

19:55.928 --> 19:57.330
Well, they're
not appreciating you

19:57.364 --> 19:59.632
after you sold them out
for a walk-in closet.

19:59.666 --> 20:02.935
So, now we need to get them
to turn on Brick.

20:02.969 --> 20:05.004
I've got us an interview
with a reporter

20:05.037 --> 20:06.273
from the Mobile Tribune.

20:06.306 --> 20:08.808
We will spin Dash's blog

20:08.841 --> 20:10.510
so that it looks like
Brick's reign of terror

20:10.543 --> 20:12.011
made you desperate enough

20:12.044 --> 20:14.347
to make a wager
for the practice.

20:14.381 --> 20:16.449
I... don't know.

20:16.483 --> 20:18.385
You know, Matthew Greenberg,
he was a bully,

20:18.418 --> 20:21.254
and he probably did steal
that Beanie Baby.

20:21.288 --> 20:22.389
But Brick...

20:22.422 --> 20:23.623
Brought it on himself.

20:23.656 --> 20:25.825
Look, we gave him a chance
to do the right thing,

20:25.858 --> 20:27.394
and he didn't take it, right?

20:27.427 --> 20:29.396
I guess.

20:29.429 --> 20:31.998
Sweetie, if you're not on board,
I will happily go home,

20:32.031 --> 20:35.468
and deal with Blake Shelton's
latest infidelity rumor.

20:35.502 --> 20:37.003
He appreciates
what I do for him.

20:37.036 --> 20:38.671
No. No, don't go.

20:38.705 --> 20:41.374
I-I appreciate you, too,
and I really need your help.

20:41.408 --> 20:42.875
That's my girl.

20:42.909 --> 20:44.377
Now...

20:44.411 --> 20:46.679
we've got to do something
about your voice.

20:46.713 --> 20:47.814
I think Joel

20:47.847 --> 20:49.449
is rubbing off on you.

20:49.482 --> 20:50.883
(clears throat)

20:50.917 --> 20:53.353
LEMON:
He calls me "Limón."

20:53.386 --> 20:54.754
He rhymes it with "fiestón."

20:54.787 --> 20:55.888
That's a crazy party.

20:55.922 --> 20:57.957
I've never been
anybody's crazy party!

20:57.990 --> 21:00.760
Lemon, I am really, truly happy
you've had this awakening,

21:00.793 --> 21:02.929
and I don't even mind that, uh,
you spent the last hour

21:02.962 --> 21:04.564
reading me Enrique's love poems

21:04.597 --> 21:06.533
even though I don't speak
a lick of Spanish.

21:06.566 --> 21:10.570
But we are back in BlueBell now,
and I need to know...

21:10.603 --> 21:13.873
what the hell
were you doing in jail?

21:13.906 --> 21:15.608
Oh, sorry.

21:15.642 --> 21:17.076
You know, now that
I'm dating two guys at once,

21:17.109 --> 21:18.745
I don't have the brain space
I used to.

21:18.778 --> 21:20.947
So, Enrique wanted to do
something special

21:20.980 --> 21:22.815
for my last night,
so we got drunk on Rioja,

21:22.849 --> 21:24.417
and we danced naked
in a fountain--

21:24.451 --> 21:25.718
which he calls fuente.

21:25.752 --> 21:26.853
Oh, right, rhymes with caliente.

21:26.886 --> 21:28.020
I-I remember the poem.

21:28.054 --> 21:28.955
Well, unfortunately,

21:28.988 --> 21:30.723
some uptight Puritan
alerted the police,

21:30.757 --> 21:32.325
so I took the heat
so Enrique could escape.

21:32.359 --> 21:33.793
T-Took the heat?

21:33.826 --> 21:35.462
Who are you?

21:35.495 --> 21:36.729
Well, I couldn't let Grandma
fire him.

21:36.763 --> 21:38.631
He's saving up
for his master's in poetry.

21:38.665 --> 21:40.099
Or something.

21:40.132 --> 21:42.101
To be honest, I don't really
understand half of what he says.

21:42.134 --> 21:43.736
All right, well,
what are you gonna do?

21:43.770 --> 21:44.971
You gonna let one of them go?

21:45.004 --> 21:46.506
(scoffs)
Heavens no.

21:46.539 --> 21:48.475
That is what the old Lemon
would've done.

21:48.508 --> 21:49.909
I am evolved now,

21:49.942 --> 21:52.111
and after all
of my romantic heartbreaks,

21:52.144 --> 21:54.113
I deserve to be dating
multiple people at once.

21:54.146 --> 21:55.715
Absolutely, but, uh,

21:55.748 --> 21:57.484
take a little word
from the wise here,

21:57.517 --> 21:59.652
when you date multiple people
and you don't tell them,

21:59.686 --> 22:01.688
somebody usually gets punched
in the face.

22:01.721 --> 22:03.089
Which is why neither of them
will find out.

22:03.122 --> 22:04.524
Luckily,
neither of them is local.

22:04.557 --> 22:05.958
I made
a very detailed calendar

22:05.992 --> 22:07.494
of when I'll see each of them,

22:07.527 --> 22:09.028
and it is based
on our meat delivery schedule

22:09.061 --> 22:10.430
at the Rammer Jammer.

22:10.463 --> 22:11.498
So I take it

22:11.531 --> 22:15.368
Carter is the filet
and Enrique is the kielbasa?

22:15.402 --> 22:17.737
Yeah, well,
read nothing into that.
(laughs)

22:19.672 --> 22:20.740
(gasps)
Stop the car!

22:20.773 --> 22:23.976
Lemon, we've been stopped for,
like, five minutes.

22:25.845 --> 22:27.046
Daddy.

22:27.079 --> 22:29.482
Oh, I haven't seen
you in so long.

22:29.516 --> 22:31.751
I know, I know, Lemonade,
and I can explain.

22:33.019 --> 22:34.787
I've missed you so much.

22:34.821 --> 22:36.723
Oh.

22:36.756 --> 22:39.091
And I missed you, too.

22:39.125 --> 22:40.760
(chuckles)

22:40.793 --> 22:42.429
Welcome home.

22:42.462 --> 22:44.130
GEORGE:
Thank you so much, Dean Hale,

22:44.163 --> 22:45.798
for taking the time
to meet with us.

22:45.832 --> 22:47.800
I want to start out by saying
I believe there's been

22:47.834 --> 22:48.968
a huge misunderstanding here.

22:49.001 --> 22:50.837
Uh, Magnolia is fully aware

22:50.870 --> 22:53.640
that she should not have
driven off of campus.

22:53.673 --> 22:55.475
However, she did so
to pick up a friend

22:55.508 --> 22:57.109
who was at a party and
needed a designated driver.

22:57.143 --> 22:59.646
Now, I find that to
be very admirable.

22:59.679 --> 23:00.580
Admirable?

23:00.613 --> 23:03.450
Did she mention the car
she took was mine?

23:04.451 --> 23:05.618
Really?

23:05.652 --> 23:08.020
I knew where he hid the keys.

23:08.054 --> 23:10.156
You should really
hide those better.

23:10.189 --> 23:11.491
Now, Dean, uh,

23:11.524 --> 23:13.192
I know that that is not ideal,

23:13.225 --> 23:15.628
(chuckles) but I think
that we can still all agree

23:15.662 --> 23:17.530
that the good outweighs
the bad here.

23:17.564 --> 23:20.800
The person she picked up
was a 19-year-old boy.

23:20.833 --> 23:22.669
Oh, oh, okay.

23:22.702 --> 23:23.836
Who doesn't attend

23:23.870 --> 23:25.772
our girls' school.

23:25.805 --> 23:27.607
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

23:28.775 --> 23:30.443
Aren't you gonna object
or something?

23:31.811 --> 23:33.446
What kind of lawyer are you?

23:33.480 --> 23:35.782
I am so sorry to have
wasted your time, Dean.

23:35.815 --> 23:38.718
Uh, we'll go ahead and
get out of your hair. Now!

23:40.887 --> 23:42.522
(sighs)

23:42.555 --> 23:44.190
I'm starting to rethink
this whole

23:44.223 --> 23:46.092
Sadie Hawkins thing.

23:46.125 --> 23:47.594
Plaid makes me look hippy.

23:47.627 --> 23:50.630
AnnaBeth!
Oh.

23:50.663 --> 23:52.098
I'm so happy to see you.
Oh.

23:52.131 --> 23:54.967
Crickett,
interesting seeing you.

23:55.001 --> 23:57.136
Bye.

24:00.607 --> 24:01.808
A.B.,

24:01.841 --> 24:03.643
I'm so sorry about Lavon.

24:03.676 --> 24:04.944
I've been crazy
the past two weeks,

24:04.977 --> 24:06.579
but I'm dying to know,
how are you?

24:06.613 --> 24:08.881
As fine as I can be,

24:08.915 --> 24:10.617
given that my heart is crushed

24:10.650 --> 24:12.118
and I'm probably gonna die alone
and whatnot.

24:12.151 --> 24:14.053
But where were you

24:14.086 --> 24:16.956
last night, and what has
been keeping you so busy?

24:16.989 --> 24:19.058
I have been calling for weeks.

24:19.091 --> 24:20.693
I'm glad I'm not the only one.

24:20.727 --> 24:22.529
What have you been doing?

24:23.996 --> 24:26.766
Well, I mean,
just taking care of Grandma.

24:26.799 --> 24:28.234
I mean, when she heard
I wanted to leave,

24:28.267 --> 24:29.969
she had, like,
20,000 errands for me to run,

24:30.002 --> 24:31.838
and suddenly she couldn't live
without her heart medicine,

24:31.871 --> 24:33.806
which is so weird, so...

24:33.840 --> 24:35.675
Surprise, darling.

24:35.708 --> 24:36.943
Heard you went
back to BlueBell.

24:36.976 --> 24:38.077
Cut my trip short

24:38.110 --> 24:39.512
'cause I missed my girlfriend.

24:39.546 --> 24:40.680
Oh, my.

24:40.713 --> 24:41.914
"Girlfriend"?

24:41.948 --> 24:43.683
Carter Covington,
we met at, uh...

24:43.716 --> 24:44.851
Oh, I-I remember, son.

24:44.884 --> 24:45.885
Yes, I do. Uh,

24:45.918 --> 24:47.854
that's why you did call anyone

24:47.887 --> 24:49.989
because you are
in a relationship?

24:50.022 --> 24:51.624
Yes. (giggles)

24:51.658 --> 24:53.092
Just one.

24:53.125 --> 24:55.161
(laughter)

24:59.866 --> 25:02.068
So, Lemon didn't say
anything about me?

25:02.101 --> 25:04.837
Nope. Of course, I didn't have
much of a chance to tell her.

25:04.871 --> 25:05.938
Life at Grandma's
past few months

25:05.972 --> 25:08.274
took almost as long to talk
about as it did to live.

25:08.307 --> 25:10.743
Well, have fun
at party number two.

25:10.777 --> 25:13.613
At this rate, I will have
the cleanest house on the block.

25:13.646 --> 25:15.548
All right, baby.

25:15.582 --> 25:17.984
Take care.

25:18.017 --> 25:19.085
Amigo,

25:19.118 --> 25:20.620
can you direct me

25:20.653 --> 25:22.689
to la casa de Limón Breeland?

25:22.722 --> 25:24.824
Casa de Breeland, okay.

25:24.857 --> 25:26.726
Hey, I'm gonna go
out on a limb here.

25:26.759 --> 25:27.860
Enrique?

25:27.894 --> 25:29.161
Sí.
Hey.

25:29.195 --> 25:30.730
It is me.
Yes, it is.

25:30.763 --> 25:32.999
I am here to surprise my lover.

25:33.032 --> 25:34.767
Wow, okay, well,
I'll tell you what.

25:34.801 --> 25:36.235
You grab a seat,
you order some food,

25:36.268 --> 25:37.770
I'll see if I can't
track her down.

25:37.804 --> 25:39.305
Gracias.
No problem.

25:39.338 --> 25:41.608
(laughs)

25:41.641 --> 25:43.776
If you want to surprise Lemon,
head over to the Owl Club.

25:43.810 --> 25:45.745
There's a big party for
her in about an hour.

25:45.778 --> 25:47.747
Gracias, señorita.

25:47.780 --> 25:51.017
I am so happy
to hear Limón has a lover.

25:51.050 --> 25:52.084
(chuckles)

25:52.118 --> 25:53.753
When she's in a good mood,

25:53.786 --> 25:55.221
it's good for the whole town.

25:56.222 --> 25:58.224
Ciao.

25:59.926 --> 26:01.327
All I said is I was tired

26:01.360 --> 26:02.895
of signing for so many
flowers for Grandma.

26:02.929 --> 26:04.330
I took that as my sign
to make sure

26:04.363 --> 26:06.332
that she started
receiving flowers, too.
Aw.

26:06.365 --> 26:07.934
Twice a day! Every time
I opened up the door,

26:07.967 --> 26:09.068
it was another
beautiful arrangement.

26:09.101 --> 26:10.737
Yellow tulips, her favorite.

26:10.770 --> 26:13.172
(phone rings)
Oh, Daddy, could you
hand me that, please?

26:13.205 --> 26:14.373
Oh, Wade?

26:14.406 --> 26:15.742
No, no,
I'm not gonna let Wade

26:15.775 --> 26:17.877
interrupt things
with Carter again.

26:17.910 --> 26:19.746
(laughs)
Wade, not Lemon's boyfriend.

26:19.779 --> 26:21.681
Never has been, never will be.

26:21.714 --> 26:24.316
(chuckles)

26:24.350 --> 26:25.885
Yo, Miss Evolved Woman,

26:25.918 --> 26:27.687
you might want to call me back
when you get this.

26:27.720 --> 26:30.723
Your... (clears throat)
kielbasa is in town.

26:39.866 --> 26:41.367
*

26:43.970 --> 26:44.971
LEMON:
Hi, how are you?

26:45.004 --> 26:47.339
So good to see you.

26:47.373 --> 26:49.241
(clears throat)

26:49.275 --> 26:51.978
Zoe Hart.
Hey, you remember!

26:52.011 --> 26:53.245
What are you doing here?

26:53.279 --> 26:54.747
Oh, Brick needed guests,

26:54.781 --> 26:56.916
and I have a surprise for him.
Welcome back.

26:56.949 --> 26:58.885
(grunts)

27:04.156 --> 27:05.725
GEORGE:
Okay.

27:05.758 --> 27:07.359
All right, it'll help

27:07.393 --> 27:09.796
if we can get your father
focused on something positive

27:09.829 --> 27:12.031
before we tell him the
bad news. You got anything?

27:12.064 --> 27:13.700
I'm not pregnant.

27:13.733 --> 27:16.836
Yeah, we'll go with "healthy."
(clears throat)

27:16.869 --> 27:21.207
Oh, this is the happiest
day of my life!

27:21.240 --> 27:23.109
(laughing)

27:23.142 --> 27:24.210
Lemon is back.

27:24.243 --> 27:25.745
She's with Carter Covington.

27:25.778 --> 27:26.979
Oh, miracles do happen.

27:27.013 --> 27:28.114
(George chuckles)

27:28.147 --> 27:29.782
Oh, I'm getting
a little emotional.

27:29.816 --> 27:31.818
Y'all gonna have
to just excuse me a minute.

27:33.786 --> 27:35.421
Uh, you know what,

27:35.454 --> 27:36.789
maybe we should just wait

27:36.823 --> 27:38.157
till your father's
a little less elated

27:38.190 --> 27:39.959
to break the news to him.

27:39.992 --> 27:41.994
Maybe we'll get lucky and a
patient will die or something.

27:43.362 --> 27:44.697
An old one.

27:46.498 --> 27:48.300
(scoffs)

27:48.334 --> 27:50.236
You're going to ambush Brick

27:50.269 --> 27:51.904
at his daughter's
welcome home party?

27:51.938 --> 27:53.372
It's the best way
for everyone to hear

27:53.405 --> 27:54.907
that he stole
the practice from me.

27:54.941 --> 27:57.343
Zoe, you gave him the practice.

27:57.376 --> 27:58.811
Technically, yes,

27:58.845 --> 28:01.380
but perception is more
what we're going for.

28:01.413 --> 28:03.182
Per... Do you even
hear yourself right now?

28:03.215 --> 28:04.884
Look, you don't need
the practice that badly.

28:04.917 --> 28:07.319
No, I need my mother
that badly, okay,

28:07.353 --> 28:09.088
so don't take this away from me.

28:10.823 --> 28:12.992
Zoe!

28:13.025 --> 28:14.060
I am gonna put aside

28:14.093 --> 28:15.394
all my personal feelings

28:15.427 --> 28:16.929
about your ridiculous ad,

28:16.963 --> 28:18.931
because this is
such a wonderful night.

28:18.965 --> 28:20.800
And I know, I know.

28:20.833 --> 28:22.802
We are not huggers,
but come here.

28:22.835 --> 28:24.503
Come here.

28:24.536 --> 28:26.105
(laughs)

28:31.277 --> 28:32.378
ANNABETH: You're dating
Carter Covington.

28:32.411 --> 28:34.146
Why didn't you tell me?

28:34.180 --> 28:35.748
We tell each other everything.

28:35.782 --> 28:37.216
I know, it's just... it's...

28:37.249 --> 28:39.118
more complicated than it looks.

28:39.151 --> 28:40.920
I've got to run.
You know what it's like

28:40.953 --> 28:42.188
when your husband
is waiting for dinner.

28:42.221 --> 28:45.024
Oh, sorry,
I guess you don't.

28:45.057 --> 28:47.794
Any who, I'll see you
at the meeting, AnnaBeth.

28:51.798 --> 28:54.366
I suppose you are wondering what
meeting she's talking about.

28:54.400 --> 28:56.535
Yes. (chuckles)

28:56.568 --> 28:57.804
No!

28:59.005 --> 29:00.472
Enrique!

29:00.506 --> 29:01.874
What a surprise.
Shh.

29:03.009 --> 29:05.945
My eyes, they ache
with this beauty I see.

29:05.978 --> 29:07.279
Yes, you know what would help
with that is a,

29:07.313 --> 29:08.380
um, tour of BlueBell.

29:08.414 --> 29:10.382
Oh, hey, you know,
I can take him.

29:10.416 --> 29:12.919
I will. Hi, Enrique.

29:12.952 --> 29:15.121
Or I mean, buenos
 tardes, mi amor.

29:16.555 --> 29:17.990
(chuckles)

29:18.024 --> 29:19.125
Wait, señorita...

29:20.259 --> 29:21.493
Are you sure that's a good idea?

29:21.527 --> 29:22.829
Uh, show him the whole town.

29:23.896 --> 29:25.431
Zoe's poor deceased father

29:25.464 --> 29:27.867
left her that practice.

29:27.900 --> 29:29.501
She never even knew him,

29:29.535 --> 29:33.005
but seeing his patients was the
way she formed a connection.

29:33.039 --> 29:36.542
That is, until it was taken
away from her by that man.

29:38.477 --> 29:39.946
Is that true?

29:39.979 --> 29:42.014
Uh, it's true-ish.

29:42.048 --> 29:43.482
Why would he do that?

29:43.515 --> 29:45.317
Why don't we go ask him
about all the times

29:45.351 --> 29:48.254
she begged him to give
her daddy's practice back

29:48.287 --> 29:49.255
and he said no.

29:49.288 --> 29:51.523
Or the time that he
hired a local detective

29:51.557 --> 29:53.259
to spy on her,

29:53.292 --> 29:55.127
so that she wouldn't heal
the people.

29:55.161 --> 29:56.428
You know, what's the rush?

29:57.897 --> 29:59.031
We should get a drink.

29:59.065 --> 30:01.333
Drinking makes
everything better.

30:02.268 --> 30:03.435
That would've been

30:03.469 --> 30:06.873
another good time to
say "off the record."

30:06.906 --> 30:08.307
MEATBALL: I did some
research and learned

30:08.340 --> 30:11.210
no woman can resist a
man in uniform. So...

30:11.243 --> 30:13.880
how do I look?

30:17.116 --> 30:19.185
(sighing):
Oh, no.

30:19.218 --> 30:21.120
Uh...

30:21.153 --> 30:23.856
The Internet was wrong again!

30:23.890 --> 30:26.192
Grandma, what a surprise.

30:26.225 --> 30:28.594
Well, I wouldn't miss
your welcome home party,

30:28.627 --> 30:31.964
even though everyone did forget
to invite me.

30:31.998 --> 30:33.065
Oh, what a terrible oversight.

30:33.099 --> 30:35.134
Let me get you a drink
so you can forget about it.

30:35.167 --> 30:37.136
And anything else
that may happen tonight.

30:37.169 --> 30:39.238
I've always wanted
to travel to Spain.

30:39.271 --> 30:40.940
Maybe you could take me
to meet your family.

30:40.973 --> 30:42.108
(chuckles)

30:43.309 --> 30:45.011
You having a stroke
or something?

30:45.044 --> 30:46.478
Where are these drinks
you promised?

30:48.514 --> 30:49.949
Hey, Enrique, you know,

30:49.982 --> 30:51.517
I know this guy
at the Rammer Jammer.

30:51.550 --> 30:53.085
He can drink beer
through his nose, right?

30:53.119 --> 30:54.386
You got to see it
with your own eyes, my friend.

30:54.420 --> 30:55.587
Yeah, come on.
 Pero...

30:55.621 --> 30:56.622
No, no, pero nothing.

30:56.655 --> 30:58.357
Let's go, pal, this way.
(laughs)

30:58.390 --> 30:59.992
Yeah.

31:00.026 --> 31:02.128
(sighs) Two gin and tonics,
double the gin,

31:02.161 --> 31:03.930
hold the tonic.

31:03.963 --> 31:06.232
Well, haven't had a chance
to say hello yet.

31:06.265 --> 31:07.599
Lavon.

31:09.501 --> 31:11.403
Listen, I heard about you
and A.B.

31:11.437 --> 31:12.504
I'm so sorry.

31:12.538 --> 31:13.672
I was rooting for you both.

31:13.705 --> 31:15.141
Thanks.

31:15.174 --> 31:17.043
Whoa.

31:17.076 --> 31:19.311
Now, uh, why do you look
the way I feel?

31:19.345 --> 31:20.980
I mean, aren't you happy?

31:21.013 --> 31:23.015
I see your boyfriend's
over there.

31:23.049 --> 31:25.017
Actually, both my boyfriends.

31:25.051 --> 31:26.618
Okay, both?

31:26.652 --> 31:28.687
Along with my grandmother,
who thinks I've reformed

31:28.720 --> 31:30.689
and has given me the money
to buy Fancie's.

31:30.722 --> 31:32.391
And it's all about
to come crashing down

31:32.424 --> 31:33.960
unless there's
an act of God or something.

31:33.993 --> 31:36.262
Well, I can't do anything
about the God part.

31:36.295 --> 31:38.998
But I might have
an angle on the, uh,

31:39.031 --> 31:41.500
"or something."

31:43.669 --> 31:45.271
Dr. Breeland? James Boyd,

31:45.304 --> 31:46.939
Montgomery Press.

31:46.973 --> 31:48.540
Is it true that you're
preventing this girl

31:48.574 --> 31:50.309
from connecting
with her dead father?

31:50.342 --> 31:51.577
(laughs): What?

31:51.610 --> 31:54.013
I understand that he
gave her his practice

31:54.046 --> 31:56.282
and you ripped it away from her.

31:56.315 --> 31:59.151
I-I wouldn't say "ripped."
Ripped it away!

31:59.185 --> 32:01.520
BOYD:
And she's gone to extraordinary
lengths to get it back,

32:01.553 --> 32:02.989
but you're shutting her out.

32:03.022 --> 32:04.590
No, no, that is...
Shutting her out!

32:04.623 --> 32:06.392
Can you explain

32:06.425 --> 32:07.526
how it benefits
the people of BlueBell

32:07.559 --> 32:10.196
for you to be taking away
their healthcare options?

32:10.229 --> 32:11.964
MEATBALL:
Yeah!

32:11.998 --> 32:13.099
On behalf
of all pretend veterans,

32:13.132 --> 32:14.666
(music stops)
I demand an explanation.

32:14.700 --> 32:17.169
There's nothing to explain.

32:17.203 --> 32:18.504
Brick didn't do
anything wrong.

32:18.537 --> 32:20.306
It was all me.
Ooh, wow!

32:20.339 --> 32:22.374
That's how loyal this girl is.

32:22.408 --> 32:25.311
She cares more about his
feelings than the truth.

32:25.344 --> 32:26.578
Mom, stop it!

32:26.612 --> 32:27.980
No, I will not.

32:28.014 --> 32:30.182
Someone has to protect
your image.

32:30.216 --> 32:32.018
Okay, well,
it's not gonna be you.

32:32.051 --> 32:33.519
You're fired!
(partygoers murmuring)

32:33.552 --> 32:35.421
(alarm ringing)

32:37.223 --> 32:38.690
Everyone, stay calm,

32:38.724 --> 32:40.492
and walk out
in an orderly fashion.

32:40.526 --> 32:42.061
Unless you are on fire,

32:42.094 --> 32:44.163
at which point,
stop, drop and roll.

32:44.196 --> 32:45.464
This way, everybody.

32:45.497 --> 32:48.234
Not too fast,
but not too slow, also.

32:51.270 --> 32:53.672
Was that you?

32:53.705 --> 32:55.141
Thank you!

32:55.174 --> 32:56.308
(chuckles)

33:02.748 --> 33:06.618
Once and for all, did you people
see why we need fire drills?!

33:06.652 --> 33:07.753
Bye.

33:07.786 --> 33:09.088
(clears throat)

33:09.121 --> 33:10.256
Lemon?

33:10.289 --> 33:11.523
What is going on with you?

33:11.557 --> 33:13.092
You're cagey.

33:13.125 --> 33:14.026
You're keeping things.

33:14.060 --> 33:15.561
Well, I could say
the same thing for you!

33:15.594 --> 33:16.628
Crickett?

33:16.662 --> 33:17.629
Meetings?

33:17.663 --> 33:18.630
Scones?

33:18.664 --> 33:20.232
Okay, truth.

33:20.266 --> 33:22.201
I rejoined the Belles.

33:22.234 --> 33:23.435
I'm not dating just Carter.

33:23.469 --> 33:24.836
I also dating
Grandma Bettie's chauffeur.

33:24.870 --> 33:27.373
I'm actually co-leader
with Crickett.
I spent last night in jail.

33:27.406 --> 33:29.708
BOTH:
Don't judge me,
it makes me feel better!

33:29.741 --> 33:31.477
(laughs)

33:36.215 --> 33:38.050
Good chat.
Okay.

33:38.084 --> 33:39.785
(sighs)

33:39.818 --> 33:41.820
Do you realize what you've done?

33:41.853 --> 33:44.490
No one fires Candace Hart!

33:44.523 --> 33:46.125
Not even Simon Cowell.

33:46.158 --> 33:47.393
I'm sorry, Mom.

33:47.426 --> 33:48.660
But come on!

33:48.694 --> 33:50.462
We don't behave like that here!

33:50.496 --> 33:52.331
I let myself get talked
into doing

33:52.364 --> 33:54.200
something horrible to Brick

33:54.233 --> 33:56.302
just because it was the only way
to get your attention.

33:56.335 --> 33:58.070
That's not true.

33:58.104 --> 33:59.238
It is totally true!

33:59.271 --> 34:00.806
You haven't shown
this much interest

34:00.839 --> 34:02.674
in me since the fifth grade!

34:02.708 --> 34:05.144
We finally got to a place

34:05.177 --> 34:06.545
where we were connecting
and working together,

34:06.578 --> 34:08.347
and I didn't want to lose it.

34:08.380 --> 34:09.348
Well, you should've
thought of that

34:09.380 --> 34:12.251
before you humiliated me
in front of everyone.

34:12.284 --> 34:14.186
(both sigh)

34:14.219 --> 34:15.786
I'm...

34:15.821 --> 34:18.590
getting a headache.

34:21.327 --> 34:22.728
I am so sorry
about this mess.

34:22.761 --> 34:24.696
Not at all what I intended
for your party.

34:24.730 --> 34:25.797
It's all right, Daddy.

34:25.831 --> 34:28.434
But have you seen
Magnolia or Carter?

34:28.467 --> 34:31.337
Lemon?

34:31.370 --> 34:34.440
I think we need to
clear a few things up.

34:34.473 --> 34:35.474
Sí.

34:35.507 --> 34:36.808
My English is not so good,

34:36.842 --> 34:38.777
but I think Señor Covington

34:38.810 --> 34:41.246
say he is also your lover.

34:41.280 --> 34:42.114
What?!

34:42.148 --> 34:44.616
Obviously I used
more delicate language.

34:44.650 --> 34:46.185
Lemon, would you
care to tell us

34:46.217 --> 34:48.085
exactly what's going on here?

34:53.759 --> 34:55.460
I've been seeing both of you.

34:55.494 --> 34:56.828
(Bettie gasps)

34:58.197 --> 34:59.498
I never meant to hurt anyone.
It's just

34:59.531 --> 35:01.367
I couldn't bear the thought
of losing either of you.

35:02.901 --> 35:05.204
Well, fool me once,

35:05.237 --> 35:06.838
shame on you.

35:06.872 --> 35:08.574
Fool me twice...

35:08.607 --> 35:10.242
shame on you again.

35:13.379 --> 35:16.548
I don't understand what he say.

35:16.582 --> 35:18.350
But I think I agree.

35:19.385 --> 35:20.752
Adiós.

35:22.654 --> 35:25.291
And all of this was going on

35:25.324 --> 35:26.625
under my roof!

35:26.658 --> 35:28.594
While I was incapacitated.

35:28.627 --> 35:31.363
This is wildly inappropriate.

35:31.397 --> 35:33.432
And a complete
betrayal of trust.

35:33.465 --> 35:34.433
I'm sorry, I...
No, no!

35:34.466 --> 35:35.867
There are no words

35:35.901 --> 35:37.436
to tell you how disappointed

35:37.469 --> 35:38.637
I am in you.

35:38.670 --> 35:41.373
But there are actions.

35:41.407 --> 35:44.510
I will no longer be giving you
the money for Fancie's.

35:46.478 --> 35:47.779
Don't look at me.

35:47.813 --> 35:49.881
You made your beds.

35:50.816 --> 35:51.683
(scoffs)

35:51.717 --> 35:53.919
In good news,

35:53.952 --> 35:55.454
I got kicked out
of boarding school,

35:55.487 --> 35:57.489
so I'm here to help
with all these crises.

36:09.835 --> 36:10.802
Wade.

36:10.836 --> 36:12.971
Come on in.

36:13.004 --> 36:15.541
I heard about the blowup
with the boyfriends.

36:15.574 --> 36:17.276
That stinks.

36:17.309 --> 36:19.945
Well, you know,
it's probably for the best.

36:21.313 --> 36:22.548
Actually I don't believe
that at all.

36:22.581 --> 36:24.550
It.. it stinks.

36:24.583 --> 36:26.418
You want to come sit.

36:26.452 --> 36:27.819
Yeah, yeah, but, uh...

36:27.853 --> 36:30.322
Look, first I-I want to
introduce you to someone.

36:30.356 --> 36:32.558
Or... well, reintroduce you.

36:32.591 --> 36:35.661
You can stop hiding now.

36:35.694 --> 36:36.728
(chuckles)

36:38.864 --> 36:41.433
Vivian Wilkes?

36:41.467 --> 36:42.868
Hi, Lemon.

36:44.002 --> 36:45.237
Why is Vivian here?

36:45.271 --> 36:46.372
Uh, well...

36:46.405 --> 36:48.307
when my ex and I broke up,

36:48.340 --> 36:49.375
the only thing
that made me feel better

36:49.408 --> 36:50.576
was cooking Vietnamese food,

36:50.609 --> 36:52.644
which is very specific, I know.

36:52.678 --> 36:54.513
But I brought along
some ingredients

36:54.546 --> 36:56.548
in case you want
to give it a shot.

36:56.582 --> 36:58.016
And I promise no bugs.

36:58.049 --> 36:59.485
Mm-hmm.

36:59.518 --> 37:01.987
She's also here because she's...

37:02.020 --> 37:04.290
my girlfriend.

37:06.725 --> 37:08.560
(laughs)

37:08.594 --> 37:11.763
That's the best news
I've heard in such a long time.

37:11.797 --> 37:15.033
You are exactly the kind of girl
that Wade needs to be with.

37:15.066 --> 37:17.303
Now, get in here
and tell me everything.

37:17.336 --> 37:20.306
Well, I mean,
maybe not everything.

37:20.339 --> 37:22.608
(both laugh)

37:22.641 --> 37:24.776
Good morning.

37:24.810 --> 37:26.478
Ooh, that toast looks delicious.

37:26.512 --> 37:27.879
Did you make it yourself?

37:27.913 --> 37:29.615
You need to pack your things.

37:29.648 --> 37:31.883
Given how radically
I have failed you

37:31.917 --> 37:33.319
in the discipline department,

37:33.352 --> 37:35.253
you obviously cannot stay here.

37:36.655 --> 37:38.290
Where are you sending me?

37:38.324 --> 37:40.826
To the strictest parent I know,
Grandma Bettie.

37:40.859 --> 37:44.296
You'll also attend a religious
school down the road from her.

37:44.330 --> 37:45.764
Oh, and before you get
any ideas,

37:45.797 --> 37:48.634
her new driver is a 65-year-old,

37:48.667 --> 37:51.303
big-boned, German woman

37:51.337 --> 37:52.438
named Helga.

37:52.471 --> 37:53.505
No.

37:54.640 --> 37:56.975
Huh.

38:01.079 --> 38:02.381
Hey, uh, Lavon?

38:02.414 --> 38:03.649
What's going on, man?

38:03.682 --> 38:04.983
What are you...

38:05.016 --> 38:07.353
not sitting at the bar anymore?

38:07.386 --> 38:08.654
No, actually I feel
a little better.

38:08.687 --> 38:11.357
Yeah, throwing
Lemon's party helped.

38:11.390 --> 38:12.824
Just like throwing
Zoe's party did.

38:12.858 --> 38:14.793
So...

38:14.826 --> 38:16.395
I think I'm gonna throw
some town events.

38:16.428 --> 38:18.564
Really?

38:19.698 --> 38:23.034
That, uh, looks
like more than some.

38:23.068 --> 38:24.903
Let's see, you got
a pet fashion show.

38:24.936 --> 38:26.672
You have a festival of fondue.

38:26.705 --> 38:28.474
Oh, I call it "Fun-due."

38:28.507 --> 38:29.841
Oh, human chess board.

38:29.875 --> 38:32.544
You got "Hogs and Hogs."

38:32.578 --> 38:33.945
Motorcycles and bacon.

38:33.979 --> 38:36.047
Don't it make you feel good
just thinking about it?

38:36.081 --> 38:37.048
No.

38:37.082 --> 38:38.550
No, not at all.

38:38.584 --> 38:40.786
Lavon, Jorge.

38:40.819 --> 38:42.554
Do you know
if Señor Wade is hiring?

38:42.588 --> 38:44.055
I get fired.

38:44.089 --> 38:45.357
And cheated on.

38:45.391 --> 38:46.425
Yeah, I heard about that.

38:46.458 --> 38:47.893
Sorry.
 Sí.

38:47.926 --> 38:50.862
Limón, she make me crazy.

38:50.896 --> 38:53.031
I should be so angry at her.

38:53.064 --> 38:55.333
But I can't make her
get out of my head.

38:56.802 --> 38:59.104
Know what that's like.
Yeah, that's Lemon for you.

38:59.137 --> 39:01.072
You both understand this?

39:01.106 --> 39:02.574
Not proud of it.

39:02.608 --> 39:03.609
Yeah.

39:06.044 --> 39:09.448
I brought apology donuts.

39:09.481 --> 39:12.451
Wow, you are really into
the "I'm sorry" pastries, huh?

39:12.484 --> 39:14.453
Only if the situation
calls for it.

39:14.486 --> 39:15.687
And this one does.

39:15.721 --> 39:18.557
I'm sorry for everything I put
you through with my mother.

39:18.590 --> 39:20.058
Hey, I'm-I'm sorry, too.

39:20.091 --> 39:22.127
I know how much you wanted it
to work out with her.

39:22.160 --> 39:23.529
I really did.

39:23.562 --> 39:24.963
Why do I care so much?

39:24.996 --> 39:27.599
(laughing):
Because it's your mom.

39:27.633 --> 39:28.600
You know?

39:28.634 --> 39:29.601
But the good news is

39:29.635 --> 39:31.870
she's not the only family
you have anymore.

39:31.903 --> 39:33.472
You have me!

39:33.505 --> 39:34.873
You know, you have Vivian
and little Harley

39:34.906 --> 39:37.609
and Brando and the entire
town of BlueBell.

39:37.643 --> 39:38.677
All of whom love you.

39:38.710 --> 39:40.746
He's right!

39:40.779 --> 39:41.980
Well...

39:42.013 --> 39:43.415
now she learns
to make a quiet entrance.

39:43.449 --> 39:45.984
As much as I hate
to admit it,

39:46.017 --> 39:47.653
you get everything
from this town

39:47.686 --> 39:49.855
that I was never able
to give you.

39:49.888 --> 39:52.157
And now you have
the Wilkes family as well.

39:52.190 --> 39:53.625
And I'm happy

39:53.659 --> 39:55.561
that you do.
Well, it doesn't mean

39:55.594 --> 39:57.463
that I don't
appreciate you, too.

39:57.496 --> 39:59.898
Well, I've still got
some things to work on.

39:59.931 --> 40:01.900
But I think we can both admit

40:01.933 --> 40:03.469
that our relationship
works better

40:03.502 --> 40:04.903
when I'm back in New York.

40:04.936 --> 40:06.505
Yes.

40:06.538 --> 40:07.806
She said it first.

40:07.839 --> 40:10.942
Thank you for everything
that you helped me with.

40:11.877 --> 40:14.179
I'll miss you.

40:14.212 --> 40:16.181
Well, I'm not leaving just yet.

40:16.214 --> 40:17.583
Joel and I

40:17.616 --> 40:18.984
need to have a sit-down,

40:19.017 --> 40:20.185
and strategize

40:20.218 --> 40:22.788
on how to get his book
sold to Hollywood.

40:22.821 --> 40:24.155
Mm.

40:24.189 --> 40:25.524
Donuts, ooh.

40:26.558 --> 40:27.726
None for you, Joel.

40:27.759 --> 40:28.927
(laughs)

40:39.004 --> 40:40.539
(laughs)

40:40.572 --> 40:42.140
Carter.

40:42.173 --> 40:44.676
Lemon, a girl like you
does not come along often.

40:44.710 --> 40:46.845
And I couldn't just walk away.

40:46.878 --> 40:48.046
And not just because your father

40:48.079 --> 40:49.247
chased me down
and threatened me.

40:49.280 --> 40:51.049
Ooh.

40:51.082 --> 40:53.685
You are the woman of my dreams.

40:53.719 --> 40:56.788
I hope you'll give me
another chance.

40:58.924 --> 41:02.561
ENRIQUE:
* Yo no te ofrezco riquezas *

41:02.594 --> 41:04.530
* Te ofrezco mi corazon *

41:04.563 --> 41:08.233
* Te ofrezco
 mi corazon *

41:08.266 --> 41:12.103
* A cambio de mi pobreza *

41:12.137 --> 41:13.539
* Ah-ah.

41:13.572 --> 41:14.673
(laughs)

41:14.706 --> 41:15.841
Enrique.

41:15.874 --> 41:17.108
(laughs)

41:17.142 --> 41:18.544
My feet take me away,

41:18.577 --> 41:20.211
but my heart,

41:20.245 --> 41:22.080
it bring me back.

41:26.284 --> 41:27.886
Wh-wh...

41:27.919 --> 41:29.755
What are we gonna do?

41:29.788 --> 41:31.823
I mean, I can't choose
just one of you.

41:31.857 --> 41:33.158
You, Limón,

41:33.191 --> 41:35.093
are worth it to fight.

41:35.126 --> 41:36.995
I agree.

41:37.028 --> 41:38.764
May the better man win.

41:41.266 --> 41:44.102
* Malagueña *

41:44.135 --> 41:46.137
* Salerosa *

41:46.171 --> 41:48.707
* Besar tus labios quisiera *

41:48.740 --> 41:53.612
* Besar tus labios
 quisiera *

41:53.645 --> 41:56.815
* Malagueña salerosa. *
