00:13.365 --> 00:15.860
Her favorite CD in the Otis Redding box set?

00:15.861 --> 00:16.887
Disc three.

00:16.887 --> 00:20.063
My favorite? Any guesses? Anyone? Come on.

00:20.391 --> 00:21.609
Disc three!

00:22.174 --> 00:25.237
God, Victoria's so amazing! I could talk about her for hours.

00:25.238 --> 00:26.767
What do you mean "could"?

00:27.275 --> 00:31.420
I'm sorry, it's just... God, I... I'm crazy about this girl.

00:31.421 --> 00:34.410
It feels like maybe... I don't want to say it.

00:34.411 --> 00:36.438
Trust that impulse, Ted.

00:37.497 --> 00:40.500
Hey. Something kind of cool just happened.

00:40.500 --> 00:45.940
My story on Pickles, the Singing Dog, just got nominated for a Local Area Media Award.

00:45.940 --> 00:47.963
A... LAME-A?

00:48.233 --> 00:50.917
We prefer Local Area Media Award.

00:51.343 --> 00:53.613
Um... there's going to be this big banquet.

00:53.614 --> 00:57.844
I know these things aren't much fun, but it would really mean a lot to me if you guys came.

00:58.986 --> 01:00.718
And there's an open bar.

01:00.719 --> 01:01.957
- Yes!
- Word up!

01:01.958 --> 01:03.485
Yeah, put me down for two.

01:03.486 --> 01:04.983
Really? It's three months away.

01:04.985 --> 01:08.981
I know, but... guys, I'm sorry, I'm going to say it.

01:08.982 --> 01:12.790
I have a feeling Victoria's going to be around for a long time.

01:13.577 --> 01:15.331
I'm going to miss Victoria.

01:15.868 --> 01:20.954
I should just skip this thing entirely. Robin's still pissed at me after... you know.

01:20.955 --> 01:23.820
You lied and said you were broken up with Victoria before you actually were

01:23.821 --> 01:27.580
so you could try to nail Robin and you wound up losing both girls in one night?

01:28.356 --> 01:30.878
Yes, that's what I meant by "you know."

01:31.840 --> 01:34.774
I haven't seen her in three weeks. She won't return my calls.

01:34.775 --> 01:37.767
- Look, I shouldn't go.
- You should definitely go.

01:37.768 --> 01:40.885
Look, it's a chance to show her you're still friends and that you support her.

01:40.886 --> 01:44.122
Or it's a chance to mess with her head by showing up with someone hotter.

01:44.123 --> 01:47.578
Even better, triple threat-- hotter and bigger boobs.

01:47.579 --> 01:49.471
- That's only two.
- Count again.

01:50.475 --> 01:54.325
Barney, I'm not bringing a date. Even if I wanted to, the thing's in two hours.

01:54.326 --> 01:55.537
So get an escort.

01:55.538 --> 01:57.776
By "escort," you mean prostitute?

01:57.777 --> 01:58.824
Why not?

01:58.825 --> 02:00.596
Because... gross?

02:01.018 --> 02:05.246
Oh, gross. What, you have some puritanical hang-up about prostitution?

02:05.247 --> 02:08.524
Dude, it's the world's oldest profession.

02:08.664 --> 02:10.252
You really think that's true?

02:10.253 --> 02:13.597
Oh, yeah. I bet even Cro-Magnons used to give cave hookers,

02:13.598 --> 02:16.002
like, an extra fish for putting out.

02:16.027 --> 02:18.498
Aha, so then the oldest profession would be fishermen.

02:18.499 --> 02:20.512
Kaboom! You've been lawyered.

02:22.167 --> 02:25.488
Come on, Ted, let's get you a hooker. It'll be fun.

02:25.500 --> 02:30.454
Okay, to bring to the banquet and hang out with ironically or to actually have sex with?

02:30.678 --> 02:31.801
Yes.

02:32.821 --> 02:36.705
No! It's illegal. And did I mention gross?

02:36.706 --> 02:39.535
That's adorable. Ted, you're such a hayseed.

02:39.743 --> 02:44.052
The companionship business is the growth industry of the 21st century.

02:44.053 --> 02:48.898
You do realize that one out of every eight adult women in America is a prostitute.

02:48.899 --> 02:50.197
- You just made that up.
- Withdrawn.

02:50.198 --> 02:51.357
Lawyered.

02:52.933 --> 02:55.721
The point is, how long has it been?

02:58.070 --> 02:59.618
57 days.

03:00.471 --> 03:02.067
- Is that your water? May I?
- Yeah, go ahead.

03:02.068 --> 03:03.169
Much obliged.

03:04.203 --> 03:06.573
57 days?!

03:06.934 --> 03:10.387
- Ted, you are in a slump.
- No, it's not a slump.

03:10.388 --> 03:12.686
It's an intentional hiatus from girls.

03:12.687 --> 03:15.561
A slump is when you strike out every time you step up to the plate.

03:15.562 --> 03:17.378
But I'm off the roster, baby.

03:17.379 --> 03:19.685
I'm in the locker room sitting in the whirlpool.

03:19.686 --> 03:22.163
And I'll tell you something, it feels pretty good.

03:22.164 --> 03:24.242
Yeah, you know what else is in that locker room?

03:24.243 --> 03:27.387
A naked dudes hanging brain.

03:27.685 --> 03:30.104
Ted, you need a lady.

03:30.105 --> 03:32.947
And I've got the next best thing-- Mary.

03:32.948 --> 03:34.404
She lives in my building.

03:34.405 --> 03:36.720
She's smart, she's hot, she's totally cool.

03:36.721 --> 03:38.124
Oh, she sounds great.

03:38.125 --> 03:40.716
And who knows? Maybe we'll wind up getting married someday.

03:40.717 --> 03:43.334
You know, if we can get a blessing from her pimp.

03:43.858 --> 03:48.837
You want to judge a fellow human being based solely on one external characteristic?

03:48.838 --> 03:50.622
That's racism.

03:50.623 --> 03:53.017
And I do not drink with racists.

03:53.018 --> 03:54.520
Good day.

03:58.692 --> 04:00.563
You're just waiting for me to speak, so you can...

04:00.564 --> 04:02.246
I said good day!

04:04.416 --> 04:06.920
So should I wear my hair up or down?

04:09.266 --> 04:10.377
Lily.

04:10.578 --> 04:11.446
What?

04:11.447 --> 04:14.628
- You okay?
- Oh, yeah, sorry.

04:14.629 --> 04:16.885
I'm just exhausted from work.

04:16.886 --> 04:20.584
The stupid school board took away nap time in all kindergarten classes

04:20.586 --> 04:24.323
and now the kids are just going crazy by the end of the day.

04:24.324 --> 04:28.533
It's much harder to deal with because, well, I don't get my nap.

04:29.093 --> 04:31.199
Wait, you were taking naps when the kids were?

04:31.200 --> 04:32.591
Is that safe?

04:32.592 --> 04:35.485
Well, they're only five. What are they gonna do to me?

04:37.903 --> 04:39.991
Ted's still coming to this thing, right?

04:39.992 --> 04:41.232
Yep.

04:41.647 --> 04:46.060
Do you think, um... hypothetically... it would be weird if I bring a date?

04:46.449 --> 04:51.037
Look at you, Scherbotsky, blatantly trying to make Ted jealous.

04:51.038 --> 04:53.108
No, it's just this guy at the station.

04:53.109 --> 04:57.285
I never get involved with co-workers, but he asked me and I said yes.

04:57.286 --> 04:58.718
Is it going to be weird?

04:58.719 --> 05:01.069
No, it's not going to be weird at all.

05:01.070 --> 05:02.827
Robin's bringing a date.

05:02.828 --> 05:04.801
Boy. That's going to be really weird.

05:04.802 --> 05:06.354
I know.

05:08.670 --> 05:10.294
Robin's bringing a date.

05:10.295 --> 05:12.942
Oh. Okay. That's not weird.

05:12.953 --> 05:15.375
She's bringing a date. I'm glad she's moving on.

05:15.376 --> 05:18.545
- Dude, it's going to be weird.
- No, it's fine.

05:18.546 --> 05:21.891
Look, in spite of whatever happened between us, Robin and I are still friends.

05:21.892 --> 05:22.988
I don't think it'll be weird.

05:22.989 --> 05:24.685
- Yeah, it won't be weird.
- Thank you.

05:24.686 --> 05:26.989
Because you're going to bring your own date.

05:26.990 --> 05:29.488
- Hello, Barney.
- Hi, Mary.

05:29.489 --> 05:31.872
Have you met Ted?

05:37.310 --> 05:38.649
Nice to meet you Ted.

05:38.650 --> 05:40.042
Hi, Mary.

05:40.119 --> 05:42.693
Wow. It's, uh, nice to meet you, too.

05:42.694 --> 05:44.269
So we're going to an award show?

05:44.270 --> 05:46.090
Uh, yeah, will you just excuse us for one minute?

05:46.091 --> 05:47.103
Barney.

05:47.104 --> 05:48.197
See you in two shakes, Mare.

05:48.198 --> 05:49.527
You two make yourselves comfortable.

05:51.927 --> 05:53.197
What the hell?

05:53.198 --> 05:57.695
Dude, your narrow-minded views on professional fornicators were harshing my mellow.

05:57.888 --> 05:59.361
So I got you a date for the evening.

05:59.362 --> 06:01.437
You got me a hooker.

06:01.612 --> 06:04.574
A really hot hook-- A hooker!

06:04.575 --> 06:06.678
Think about it, this is perfect.

06:06.679 --> 06:09.670
A-- it will make Robin insanely jealous...

06:09.671 --> 06:12.390
B-- you get to have sex with her...

06:12.391 --> 06:14.748
and C-- maybe by getting to know Mary,

06:14.749 --> 06:17.110
you'll come to see that courtesans are people, too.

06:17.111 --> 06:21.277
And D-- "B" all night long.

06:21.278 --> 06:24.124
I'm not taking a prostitute to Robin's banquet.

06:24.125 --> 06:26.381
The only people who will know are you, me and Marshall.

06:26.382 --> 06:27.456
No one will suspect a thing.

06:27.457 --> 06:31.292
They'll just see you with this unbelievably smoking hot girl and...

06:31.293 --> 06:33.392
Okay, that's a little bit suspicious.

06:34.925 --> 06:38.326
Look, I'm just trying to expand your horizons a little bit tonight.

06:38.327 --> 06:41.638
But if you're not interested, fine, I'm out 500 bucks. Whatever.

06:41.639 --> 06:43.020
500 bucks?

06:43.029 --> 06:45.162
Ted, you're my cabron.

06:45.163 --> 06:48.883
You think I'm gonna stick you with some toothless tranny from the Port Authority?

06:49.673 --> 06:51.275
Look at how hot she is.

06:51.276 --> 06:53.308
Robin would be so jealous.

06:53.309 --> 06:56.350
I'm not trying to make Robin jealous, Barney.

06:56.350 --> 07:00.142
Look, I... tell Mary, thanks, but no thanks. I have a soul.

07:01.220 --> 07:06.183
And then your Uncle Marhsall and I had one of our famous telepathic conversations.

07:06.333 --> 07:07.927
Check out Robin's date.

07:07.929 --> 07:09.067
I know.

07:09.068 --> 07:10.402
Is that who I think it is?

07:10.403 --> 07:11.410
Yep.

07:11.411 --> 07:13.691
It's Sandy Rivers.

07:13.819 --> 07:16.709
Sandy Rivers was the face of Metro News One,

07:16.710 --> 07:19.876
the most low-budget cable news network ever.

07:19.877 --> 07:22.182
Sandy time. Sandy time!

07:22.183 --> 07:25.876
He was best known for his morning segment "In Today's Paper,"

07:25.877 --> 07:28.910
during which he literally flipped through today's papers,

07:28.911 --> 07:30.371
reading them aloud to viewers.

07:30.372 --> 07:33.996
Here we have, on the front page, a story about a...

07:33.997 --> 07:38.361
I guess, a guy in a superhero costume climbing the Empire State Building.

07:39.014 --> 07:40.502
Looks interesting.

07:41.213 --> 07:45.079
These idiotic filler pieces were a guilty pleasure of ours.

07:45.080 --> 07:47.166
Which Sandy do we want today?

07:47.478 --> 07:49.737
French Sandy, porn star Sandy...?

07:49.738 --> 07:51.103
Yosemite Sandy, definitely.

07:51.104 --> 07:52.791
Excellent choice.

08:02.776 --> 08:05.114
I love this guy.

08:05.115 --> 08:07.517
I hate this guy.

08:10.175 --> 08:11.509
Hey.

08:11.606 --> 08:13.463
- Hi.
- I'm Lily.

08:13.464 --> 08:15.024
Hi. Mary. It's nice to meet you.

08:15.025 --> 08:17.659
Mary is a friend of Barney's. Barney invited her.

08:17.660 --> 08:20.093
Just met Mary ourselves. Don't know too much about Mary.

08:20.094 --> 08:21.285
Look, a beer.

08:24.135 --> 08:25.036
Hey.

08:25.037 --> 08:26.093
Hi.

08:26.094 --> 08:28.333
- You look nice.
- Oh, um, Ted, this is Sandy.

08:28.334 --> 08:32.621
Hi. Sandy Rivers. Use my full name. People get a kick out of it.

08:32.621 --> 08:34.052
Hi, Sandy.

08:34.104 --> 08:35.443
Rivers.

08:36.115 --> 08:37.607
So are you two, uh...

08:37.607 --> 08:39.619
Starting a bunch of office rumors?

08:39.620 --> 08:42.243
Looks that way. Looks that way.

08:43.254 --> 08:45.517
Oh, how rude of me.

08:45.518 --> 08:48.703
Uh, Robin, Sandy... Rivers...

08:49.082 --> 08:51.961
this is Mary, my date.

08:59.309 --> 09:03.627
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the 45th annual Local Area Media Awards.

09:03.628 --> 09:05.536
Please say hello to our host for the evening,

09:05.537 --> 09:07.919
king of the Saturday Afternoon Kung Fu Movie,

09:07.920 --> 09:09.619
Vampire Lou!

09:13.903 --> 09:17.756
Tonight we celebrate the very best in broadcasting

09:17.757 --> 09:21.014
and the triumph of the human spirit.

09:21.285 --> 09:24.911
Man, Vampire Lou just looks great.

09:25.545 --> 09:28.310
I can't believe I'm on a date with a hooker.

09:28.631 --> 09:32.308
Yeah, I can't believe you let her and Lily go to the ladies' room together, man.

09:32.309 --> 09:33.884
Secrets come out in there.

09:33.885 --> 09:35.226
Oh, please. How's it's going to come out?

09:35.227 --> 09:38.046
"Uh, pass me a towel. P.S., I have sex for money."

09:38.047 --> 09:40.381
- Who has sex for money?
- Nobody.

09:40.382 --> 09:42.632
What did you guys talk about in there? Anything interesting?

09:42.633 --> 09:44.376
No, not really.

09:44.724 --> 09:47.878
We just chitchatted and I borrowed her lipstick.

09:49.760 --> 09:54.906
Why is Vampire Lou the host of a Saturday Afternoon Kung Fu Movie?

09:54.907 --> 09:57.119
You know, it just makes no sense.

09:57.120 --> 09:59.032
God, that pisses me off.

09:59.187 --> 10:00.700
Lily, you okay?

10:00.701 --> 10:04.208
Oh, yeah, I'm just tired. And when I get tired, I get cranky.

10:04.209 --> 10:06.467
Really? I couldn't imagine you cranky.

10:06.508 --> 10:09.111
"Really? I couldn't imagine you cranky."

10:10.791 --> 10:13.393
Wow. Why are you so tired?

10:13.394 --> 10:18.645
Well, I teach kindergarten and the school board took away my nap time, the kids' nap time.

10:18.917 --> 10:20.249
Lily, quit your job.

10:20.250 --> 10:22.634
Work at a private school. You won't have to deal with the school board,

10:22.635 --> 10:24.367
and you'll make a ton more money.

10:24.368 --> 10:25.536
Well, guess what, Barney?

10:25.537 --> 10:29.193
I don't base all my life decisions on how much money I'm going to make,

10:29.194 --> 10:31.349
unlike you and, sadly, my fiance.

10:31.350 --> 10:33.294
Well, it's just an internship, for the record.

10:33.295 --> 10:37.328
Yeah, because if I did sacrifice all my values just for an easy buck,

10:37.329 --> 10:39.245
what would that make me?

10:39.439 --> 10:41.060
A prostitute.

10:41.333 --> 10:43.529
Exactly. Thank you, Mary.

10:43.530 --> 10:46.025
So, Mary, what do you do for a living?

10:46.026 --> 10:47.707
She's a paralegal.

10:49.462 --> 10:51.346
Yes, I'm a paralegal.

10:51.382 --> 10:53.802
Oh, so, Mary the paralegal.

10:53.803 --> 10:56.583
What does a paralegal do exactly?

10:57.404 --> 11:02.055
I just assist with day-to-day clerical work in a law firm downtown.

11:02.056 --> 11:03.738
Oh, what firm?

11:03.821 --> 11:06.129
Douglas, O'Halloran and Stamp.

11:06.130 --> 11:07.530
That's a real law firm.

11:07.531 --> 11:09.006
I know.

11:09.007 --> 11:10.607
Nice.

11:11.406 --> 11:13.210
You're pretty good on your feet.

11:13.211 --> 11:14.927
Are you flirting with me?

11:14.928 --> 11:16.337
Is that allowed?

11:16.338 --> 11:18.735
Yes, it's encouraged.

11:19.254 --> 11:22.699
You know, I wouldn't normally say this on a first date, but...

11:22.755 --> 11:24.198
well, considering...

11:24.568 --> 11:27.813
I'm just going to say it. You are so hot!

11:28.288 --> 11:30.496
- Well, thank you.
- You're welcome.

11:30.817 --> 11:33.759
Mary, Ted is a great guy. You hold on to him.

11:33.760 --> 11:36.545
Don't let him out of your sight for a minute.

11:37.863 --> 11:40.163
So, Sandy, what do you do?

11:40.164 --> 11:42.039
Oh, wait, I know what you do.

11:42.040 --> 11:44.026
You're the guy who reads the paper in the morning.

11:44.027 --> 11:45.556
You got me.

11:45.717 --> 11:47.100
What do you do, Ted?

11:47.101 --> 11:49.424
Oh, same thing as you-- I read the paper every morning.

11:49.425 --> 11:53.170
But then after that, I finish my coffee and I go to my real job as an architect

11:53.171 --> 11:55.664
where I make an actual contribution to the world.

11:55.822 --> 11:58.460
I'm just kidding. Love your show. You're terrific.

11:58.461 --> 11:59.769
Thanks.

11:59.822 --> 12:01.888
I never tire of hearing that.

12:04.463 --> 12:10.001
Hey, you know that scene in Empire where they lower the helmet onto Darth Vader's head?

12:10.002 --> 12:13.178
Do you think that's how Sandy puts his hair on in the morning?

12:14.011 --> 12:18.739
You just insulted someone I hate by referencing something I love.

12:18.775 --> 12:21.676
Damn, you just got even hotter.

12:24.361 --> 12:27.932
And so, as the night wore on, I started to realize,

12:27.933 --> 12:32.704
this girl, despite what she did for a living, was kind of great.

12:36.656 --> 12:38.569
- Hey.
- Hey.

12:38.570 --> 12:40.219
Mary seems nice.

12:40.220 --> 12:41.788
Have you kissed her yet, or are you waiting

12:41.789 --> 12:44.953
until you're in a serious relationship with someone else?

12:44.954 --> 12:48.080
I, uh... I wanted to apologize for everything that happened.

12:48.081 --> 12:49.933
And just like that, it's all okay.

12:49.934 --> 12:50.932
Roll credits.

12:50.933 --> 12:53.907
So you're going to be mad at me forever? What, we're not even friends now?

12:53.908 --> 12:55.927
- We're still friends.
- Are we?

12:55.928 --> 12:57.995
You don't return my calls, we never hang out

12:57.996 --> 13:01.373
and now you're trying to make my jealous by waving Edward R. Moron in my face?

13:01.374 --> 13:05.438
Oh, and Paralegally Blonde isn't here in her low-cut dress to make me jealous?

13:05.439 --> 13:07.517
Oh, so now she's a whore?

13:08.654 --> 13:09.646
What?

13:09.647 --> 13:13.088
You know something? Mary the paralegal is awesome.

13:13.089 --> 13:15.199
And you know what else? I didn't come here tonight to make you jealous,

13:15.200 --> 13:17.051
I came here to support you as a friend.

13:17.052 --> 13:19.453
And frankly, I'm sick of trying.

13:22.891 --> 13:24.552
I like that guy.

13:28.479 --> 13:30.389
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:30.390 --> 13:31.986
What were you guys talking about over there?

13:31.987 --> 13:36.534
Oh, I was, uh, just telling my friend that I think you're awesome.

13:36.995 --> 13:38.455
Well, thanks.

13:39.293 --> 13:42.431
You know, this is one of the nicer hotels I've ever been in.

13:42.432 --> 13:43.853
Oh, yeah, my friend did the remodel.

13:43.854 --> 13:45.590
You should see the rooms. The views are amazing.

13:45.591 --> 13:48.981
Yeah? Maybe it's too bad we don't have a room.

13:49.524 --> 13:52.562
Room 1506. My treat. You kids go nuts.

13:52.563 --> 13:54.408
Actually, don't use the mini-bar.

14:01.554 --> 14:03.783
Do it. Come on, Ted, do it.

14:03.784 --> 14:06.244
This is one of those things you have to do before you turn 30.

14:06.245 --> 14:07.353
Sleep with a prostitute?

14:07.354 --> 14:09.689
No, lose your virginity. What up.

14:09.693 --> 14:14.194
Statistic-- men who have had at least one relationship with a prostitute

14:14.195 --> 14:18.140
are 75% more likely to have success in future relationships.

14:18.141 --> 14:18.910
You just made that up.

14:18.911 --> 14:20.589
- Withdrawn.
- Lawyered.

14:20.632 --> 14:23.439
Okay, three things. First of all, Robin's category's almost up.

14:23.440 --> 14:25.514
And second of all, you cannot do this.

14:25.515 --> 14:27.162
It's wrong on every level.

14:27.163 --> 14:31.558
And third, I've been placing small items in Sandy's hair all night. He still hasn't noticed.

14:31.559 --> 14:35.110
I know I can't do this. I'm not doing this. It's just... it's a shame.

14:35.111 --> 14:36.081
She's really cool.

14:36.082 --> 14:38.772
- Yeah, well... there we go.
- Scooter "Bam-Bam" Branson for

14:38.773 --> 14:42.454
A Bicycle-- Joyride or Deathtrap?

14:42.455 --> 14:46.578
Mike Murphy for 13, Pregnant and Addicted.

14:46.579 --> 14:50.768
And Robin Scherbotsky for Pickles, the Singing Dog.

14:50.769 --> 14:52.220
And the winner is...

14:52.221 --> 14:54.519
Robin Scherbotsky.

15:00.368 --> 15:01.353
Thanks.

15:03.642 --> 15:06.854
Oh, wow. This is really a surprise.

15:06.855 --> 15:11.777
Um, you know it's nice to be able to share this award with my friends.

15:11.778 --> 15:13.152
They're all here tonight.

15:13.153 --> 15:15.886
Marshall, Lily, Sandy Rivers...

15:17.935 --> 15:19.302
Barney...

15:20.337 --> 15:23.062
And that's it. Those are all my friends.

15:23.063 --> 15:24.425
Thank you.

15:31.728 --> 15:34.419
- Congratulations.
- Oh, thanks.

15:34.699 --> 15:37.678
Um, Sandy, do you want to get a cab?

15:37.679 --> 15:39.568
Sure. Let's go.

15:39.806 --> 15:43.297
Yeah, this party's dead. Mary, you want to go upstairs?

15:44.381 --> 15:46.755
We, uh, got a room.

15:48.166 --> 15:50.729
Dude, what are you doing?

15:50.882 --> 15:52.019
What's it look like?

15:52.020 --> 15:55.126
It looks bad, is what it looks like. You cannot do this.

15:55.127 --> 15:58.116
Marshall, she is a really cool girl when you get to know her.

15:58.117 --> 16:00.488
Besides, I'm trying to make Robin jealous.

16:00.489 --> 16:02.726
Oh, that's real mature.

16:02.815 --> 16:06.078
Marshall, what is up with you and Ted?

16:06.079 --> 16:08.367
Nothing, baby. Don't worry about it.

16:08.368 --> 16:10.388
Fine. Do what you want.

16:10.811 --> 16:12.015
Hey.

16:12.813 --> 16:14.163
Should we go?

16:14.164 --> 16:15.508
Yeah.

16:16.759 --> 16:17.985
Thanks.

16:17.986 --> 16:19.371
Well...

16:19.805 --> 16:20.913
Good night.

16:21.265 --> 16:22.578
Good night.

16:38.076 --> 16:39.521
So, did you and Barney ever...?

16:39.522 --> 16:41.122
There's not enough money in the world.

16:41.123 --> 16:42.646
Oh, thank God.

16:46.575 --> 16:48.379
Wow, so they're...?

16:50.230 --> 16:52.856
Robin, where's Sandy Rivers?

16:52.857 --> 16:54.580
I put him in a cab.

16:54.715 --> 16:55.944
So you and he aren't...?

16:55.945 --> 16:58.046
I don't date people I work with.

16:58.131 --> 17:00.523
I was just trying to make Ted jealous.

17:00.660 --> 17:01.483
Is he...?

17:01.484 --> 17:03.450
He's off trying to make you jealous.

17:03.796 --> 17:05.505
Oh, well, good for them.

17:06.223 --> 17:09.523
And, you know, if Ted likes her, she's probably pretty cool.

17:11.083 --> 17:13.933
Lily, I know you're asleep, but I have to tell someone this,

17:13.934 --> 17:17.539
and we tell each other everything. So, here it goes.

17:17.869 --> 17:19.769
Mary's not a paralegal.

17:19.875 --> 17:21.391
She's a prostitute.

17:21.392 --> 17:23.550
Mary's a prostitute?

17:23.965 --> 17:24.931
What?!

17:24.932 --> 17:26.395
Barney paid for her.

17:27.218 --> 17:28.725
Is that true?

17:28.726 --> 17:31.860
We were having a conversation about prostitution,

17:31.861 --> 17:34.826
and then Barney calls her up and then she shows up at the bar

17:34.827 --> 17:36.783
and now she and Ted are upstairs.

17:36.784 --> 17:39.260
Okay, seriously, what is going on with Ted lately?

17:39.261 --> 17:41.636
Is he having a nervous breakdown?

17:41.789 --> 17:45.944
You know, Barney, for anyone else, this would be a new low,

17:45.945 --> 17:48.752
but sadly, for you, it's just a new middle.

17:50.193 --> 17:53.927
Oh, my God, I used her lipstick! Ah!

17:53.929 --> 17:55.245
That's her napkin.

17:55.246 --> 17:56.576
No!

17:57.849 --> 18:00.770
Okay, well, I guess now is as good a time as any.

18:00.771 --> 18:03.153
In keeping with tonight's award show motif,

18:03.154 --> 18:06.533
I'd like to announce this evening's big twist ending!

18:09.606 --> 18:11.689
Vampire Lou, would you do the honors?

18:13.585 --> 18:17.014
"Mary's not really a prostitute."

18:17.241 --> 18:18.070
What?

18:18.071 --> 18:19.900
That's all, Vampire Lou. Nicely done.

18:19.901 --> 18:21.419
- So she's not...?
- No.

18:21.420 --> 18:23.771
Mary's just a paralegal who lives in my building.

18:23.772 --> 18:25.834
Oh-- ha-ha! And here's the best part--

18:25.835 --> 18:28.520
she has no idea that Ted thinks she's a hooker.

18:30.877 --> 18:32.298
Oh, come on.

18:32.299 --> 18:34.725
If you don't laugh, it just seems mean.

18:45.409 --> 18:47.782
I feel kind of like Richard Gere.

18:48.459 --> 18:51.073
- Not shy about your looks, are you?
- No.

18:53.336 --> 18:56.552
You know, Mary, I've never done this before.

18:56.553 --> 18:57.982
Done what?

18:57.983 --> 19:02.555
You know, been... on a "date."

19:02.958 --> 19:04.387
Yeah, right.

19:05.191 --> 19:06.632
Wait, you're kidding, right?

19:06.633 --> 19:07.915
No.

19:07.916 --> 19:09.793
Why, is that so odd?

19:09.794 --> 19:15.465
Well, Ted, I mean, I've been going on dates since I was 15.

19:15.684 --> 19:17.866
God, you were just a kid.

19:18.619 --> 19:22.182
Well, look, let's just have a few drinks. We'll relax and...

19:22.183 --> 19:26.894
Yeah, that sounds great. I had clients riding me all day long.

19:27.445 --> 19:28.762
Must be tough.

19:28.763 --> 19:31.446
Yeah. I mean, this one guy just wouldn't leave me alone.

19:31.447 --> 19:33.543
I mean, talk about anal.

19:39.007 --> 19:42.289
Well, here we are.

19:45.777 --> 19:49.169
Okay, look, Mary, I like you a lot.

19:49.170 --> 19:53.358
I'm sort of amazed at how much I like you, but I can't do this.

19:53.359 --> 19:54.780
You're a hooker.

19:55.807 --> 19:57.162
What?

19:57.163 --> 20:00.351
Look, maybe I'm old-fashioned, but I'm sorry, that's a deal-breaker for me.

20:00.352 --> 20:02.531
I'm not going to have sex with a prostitute.

20:02.532 --> 20:05.497
No... Ted, I'm a paralegal.

20:05.498 --> 20:07.413
Come on, Mary, there's no one else around.

20:07.414 --> 20:09.045
You're a hooker.

20:09.575 --> 20:11.207
No, Ted...

20:11.358 --> 20:12.999
I'm a paralegal.

20:13.241 --> 20:16.190
No, you're a hooker.

20:17.102 --> 20:20.643
No, I'm a paralegal.

20:24.052 --> 20:26.161
You're a paralegal.

20:29.969 --> 20:31.815
That was not funny.

20:31.816 --> 20:33.131
Not funny, dude.

20:33.132 --> 20:35.665
I know, it was hilarious.

20:35.724 --> 20:37.461
Why would you do that?

20:37.462 --> 20:39.309
I did it to prove a point.

20:39.310 --> 20:41.050
What point?

20:42.261 --> 20:44.457
Stay with me. It's going to come to me.

20:45.590 --> 20:48.306
No. Ah, okay, here's the point.

20:48.307 --> 20:50.306
You thought that Mary was a sure thing, right?

20:50.307 --> 20:54.161
So what happened? She took you up to a hotel room on the first date.

20:54.162 --> 20:57.146
All you have to do is be that confident with every girl you meet

20:57.147 --> 20:58.333
and your slump is over.

20:58.334 --> 21:01.440
So the message is, I should treat every woman like a whore?

21:01.441 --> 21:03.583
Come on, dude, you should be thanking me.

21:03.584 --> 21:05.496
She slapped me and stormed off.

21:05.497 --> 21:08.320
Can you blame her? You called her a hooker.

21:09.562 --> 21:12.097
I'm sorry, dude, it was funny.

21:12.098 --> 21:15.670
Yeah. Well, it's getting late. I should get back to my room.

21:15.671 --> 21:16.450
Your room?

21:16.451 --> 21:19.532
Yeah, that really expensive hotel room you put on your credit card--

21:19.533 --> 21:20.584
never checked out.

21:20.585 --> 21:22.782
By the way, you know what's super fun?

21:22.783 --> 21:25.491
Pouring Dom Perignon down a bathtub drain.

21:25.492 --> 21:28.524
Well, it's almost 3:00. Got a massage. Toodles.

21:31.642 --> 21:34.841
Come on, if you don't laugh, it just seems mean.

21:36.920 --> 21:40.217
