For numenator.

00:20.270 --> 00:21.270
Start playing.

We'd like to thank the fo...

00:26.568 --> 00:27.985
Our cash bail will be out by...

00:28.153 --> 00:29.612
- And, you know...
- Bobo.

00:29.780 --> 00:30.947
Behind the mighty.

00:32.323 --> 00:33.741
Said to my wife, "Berni..."

00:33.909 --> 00:36.160
- Sorry, boy.
- They hurt...

00:37.037 --> 00:38.204
- went through the crack.

00:38.372 --> 00:39.872
- This ham...
- Our 12th edition...

00:40.040 --> 00:41.624
of the Psychic Friends Network.

00:41.792 --> 00:43.126
Shea Stad...

00:45.087 --> 00:46.754
You're watching TV Time!

00:46.922 --> 00:51.884
The only network playing lots of old stuff
in nothing but black and white.

00:52.052 --> 00:54.762
Why, it's fun for the whole family.

00:54.930 --> 00:58.933
TV Time! Remember, you're soaking in it.

00:59.143 --> 01:01.436
This Friday on TV Time!

01:01.645 --> 01:04.730
Take the phone off the hook
and the plastic off the couch.

01:04.897 --> 01:08.693
That's right,
it's the Pleasantville marathon.

01:08.861 --> 01:13.614
Twenty-four hours chocked full
of pure family values.

01:13.782 --> 01:15.199
Featuring the warm greeting.

01:15.367 --> 01:16.743
Honey, I'm home.

01:16.910 --> 01:19.537
- Proper nutrition.
- Do you want some more cookies?

01:19.705 --> 01:21.706
And, of course, safe sex.

01:23.292 --> 01:26.335
Why, it's a scrapbook of
all your favorite Pleasantville memories.

01:26.545 --> 01:28.337
There's "Trouble at the Barbershop"...

01:28.505 --> 01:30.173
"Fireman for a Day"...

01:30.340 --> 01:31.632
"The Big Game"...

01:31.800 --> 01:34.093
and who could forget
"Bud Gets a Job"?

01:34.261 --> 01:37.555
So join all your favorites:
Mary Sue, Bud, George and Betty...

01:37.723 --> 01:40.683
and, oh, yes,
Mr. Johnson at the soda shop.

01:40.851 --> 01:43.144
There's more.
If you put your thinking caps on...

01:43.312 --> 01:46.647
you could win $1000
in our Pleasantville trivia contest...

01:46.815 --> 01:49.692
plus a free trip
to the Pleasantville of your choice.

01:50.360 --> 01:53.488
Flash back to kinder, gentler times...

01:53.655 --> 01:58.868
on the Pleasantville marathon,
this Friday, only on TV Time!

02:18.222 --> 02:19.472
Hi.

02:20.891 --> 02:21.933
I mean, hi.

02:23.227 --> 02:26.479
Look, you probably don't think
I should be asking you this.

02:26.647 --> 02:29.232
I mean, not knowing you well and all.

02:30.067 --> 02:34.946
I mean, you know, I know you.
Everybody knows you.

02:35.113 --> 02:37.698
I just don't know you technically.

02:40.327 --> 02:41.327
Uh...

02:41.495 --> 02:45.164
Anyhow, I don't know
what you're doing this weekend...

02:45.374 --> 02:46.958
but my mom's leaving town...

02:47.125 --> 02:51.254
and she's letting me borrow the car,
so, you know...

03:01.056 --> 03:03.432
Okey-dokey, so just give me a call.

03:03.600 --> 03:05.017
Let me know.

03:06.270 --> 03:08.354
Bye.

03:08.522 --> 03:10.606
For those of you going
to college next year...

03:10.774 --> 03:12.775
the chance of finding a good job...

03:12.943 --> 03:16.112
will actually decrease
by the time you graduate.

03:16.280 --> 03:18.239
The available number
of entry-level jobs...

03:18.407 --> 03:21.742
will drop 31 percent
over the next four years.

03:21.952 --> 03:26.622
Median income for those jobs
will go down as well.

03:26.790 --> 03:29.917
Obviously, my friends,
it's a competitive world...

03:30.085 --> 03:32.044
and good grades
are your only ticket through.

03:33.422 --> 03:34.755
In fact, by the year 2000...

03:34.965 --> 03:38.009
- the chance of contracting HIV
from a non-monogamous lifestyle...

03:38.176 --> 03:40.636
will climb to one in 150.

03:40.804 --> 03:44.974
The odds of dying in an auto accident
are only one in 2500.

03:45.142 --> 03:46.726
This marks a drastic increase...

03:46.935 --> 03:51.188
- from 14 years ago, when ozone depletion was
at just 10 percent of its current level.

03:51.398 --> 03:53.024
By the time you are 30 years old...

03:53.191 --> 03:56.485
average global temperature
will have risen two and a half degrees...

03:56.653 --> 03:58.696
causing such
catastrophic consequences...

03:58.864 --> 04:03.284
as typhoons, floods,
widespread drought, and famine.

04:04.161 --> 04:07.747
Okay, who can tell me what famine is?

04:17.548 --> 04:19.341
Honey, I'm home.

04:22.220 --> 04:25.514
Hello, darling. How was your day?

04:25.682 --> 04:30.019
Oh, swell. You know, Mr. Connell says
if things keep going the way they are...

04:30.187 --> 04:32.855
I might be seeing that promotion
sooner than I thought.

04:33.023 --> 04:34.982
Oh, darling, that's wonderful.

04:35.150 --> 04:37.443
I always knew you could do it.

04:38.820 --> 04:42.531
Hey, pumpkin, what's that smell?
Is that your meat loaf?

04:42.908 --> 04:43.950
"It might be."

04:44.117 --> 04:45.326
It might be.

04:45.494 --> 04:49.038
Oh, pumpkin, you sure know the way
to this man's heart.

04:50.374 --> 04:52.583
No, no. That was not the deal.

04:52.751 --> 04:55.628
No, you have custody
first weekend of every month.

04:55.837 --> 04:57.254
This is the first weekend.

04:57.839 --> 04:59.966
No. I'm not gonna bail you out.

05:00.133 --> 05:02.510
I'm going out of town this weekend.

05:02.719 --> 05:04.053
La Costa.

05:04.721 --> 05:08.307
Barry, if I wanna have a mud bath with my new
boyfriend, that's my business, isn't it?

05:09.643 --> 05:11.811
- Hey, where are those kids?
- Excuse me?

05:11.979 --> 05:14.230
- "Right behind you, Father."
- Right behind you.

05:14.398 --> 05:16.148
Right behind you, Father.

05:17.067 --> 05:20.695
Mother, Father,
Bud has a little surprise for you.

05:20.862 --> 05:22.029
What's that, Bud?

05:22.197 --> 05:23.656
First place in the science fair.

05:25.283 --> 05:26.909
There were lots of swell projects.

05:27.077 --> 05:28.869
I guess mine was just the swellest.

05:29.037 --> 05:32.581
Darling, that's wonderful,
except there's no such word as "swellest."

05:32.749 --> 05:35.751
Well, gee whiz, Mom,
it wasn't the English fair.

05:38.505 --> 05:39.797
No, that's not the point.

05:39.965 --> 05:43.426
The point is,
you're supposed to see them.

05:43.593 --> 05:46.178
Fine, fine, fine. See them another time.

05:47.931 --> 05:49.598
"What's a mother to do?"

05:49.766 --> 05:51.600
What's a mother to do?

06:02.362 --> 06:05.281
Okay, in the very first
Pleasantville episode...

06:05.449 --> 06:09.160
whose window did Bud break when he was
playing with his father's golf clubs?

06:09.327 --> 06:10.619
Easy. Mr. Jenkins.

06:10.787 --> 06:13.164
What job did Mr. Jenkins have?

06:14.750 --> 06:16.375
Salesman.

06:16.585 --> 06:21.672
What did Bud and Mary Sue name the cat
they found in the gutter?

06:22.174 --> 06:23.215
Scout?

06:24.176 --> 06:25.384
Marmalade.

06:25.594 --> 06:28.137
All right, all right.

06:28.305 --> 06:30.056
Here's one.

06:30.223 --> 06:34.143
Why did their parents come home early
from their weekend at the lake?

06:37.230 --> 06:40.483
Because Bud didn't answer the phone,
and they were worried about him.

06:40.650 --> 06:44.153
Man, you're unbelievable.

06:44.321 --> 06:47.073
You'll win this thing for sure.
When is it on?

06:48.325 --> 06:51.660
Marathon starts at 6:30.
Contest is tomorrow at noon.

06:52.996 --> 06:55.915
Thousand bucks, huh?
And it's on all night?

06:56.083 --> 06:59.460
Well, of course it is, Howard.
That's why they call it a marathon.

07:00.712 --> 07:03.672
Oh, my God, he is, like, so pathetic.

07:03.840 --> 07:06.759
I can't believe you're, like,
related to him.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.219
Only on my parents' side.

07:08.386 --> 07:10.513
Yeah, but you guys are twins and stuff.

07:10.680 --> 07:13.724
You must be from
the cool side of the uterus.

07:13.892 --> 07:16.560
Oh, my God, here they come.

07:17.479 --> 07:20.731
Oh, my God. Don't do anything.
Just don't do anything.

07:20.899 --> 07:22.441
What?

07:26.696 --> 07:30.533
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:30.951 --> 07:34.370
- Saw you at the mall yesterday.
- Yeah, I saw you too.

07:35.247 --> 07:37.665
So you gonna watch
the concert on MTV tonight?

07:37.833 --> 07:39.750
Yeah. You?

07:40.877 --> 07:42.211
Yeah.

07:45.132 --> 07:46.841
My mom's gonna be out of town.

07:49.678 --> 07:51.762
- Cool.
- Cool.

07:52.055 --> 07:53.556
It was so amazing, Daph.

07:53.723 --> 07:56.308
I was like,
"My mom's gonna go out of town."

07:56.518 --> 07:58.727
And he was like,
"Well, maybe we could..."

07:58.895 --> 08:01.730
And I was like, "Yeah, sure."
And he was like, "Cool."

08:01.898 --> 08:04.483
I know. He's so smart.

08:04.651 --> 08:08.654
I don't know. I'm thinking about
that red thing I got at the mall.

08:08.822 --> 08:10.072
It's not slutty.

08:12.325 --> 08:14.201
It's fun.

08:14.411 --> 08:16.829
Well, hello,
he's not coming over to study.

08:17.581 --> 08:19.081
Yeah, I know.

08:19.249 --> 08:22.293
Well, sometimes I'm jealous of you too.

08:22.502 --> 08:26.005
He's not homeless, Howard.
They just don't say where he lives.

08:27.674 --> 08:29.758
Well, it's a silly question.

08:31.052 --> 08:33.971
Because nobody's homeless
in Pleasantville.

08:35.807 --> 08:37.640
Because that's just not what it's like.

08:41.770 --> 08:45.274
Look, Howard, it's almost 6:30.
I gotta go.

09:13.803 --> 09:15.721
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

09:15.889 --> 09:18.724
Cut it out, David.
Mark Davis is gonna be here in minutes.

09:18.892 --> 09:21.727
Great. The Pleasantville
marathon starts at 6:30.

09:21.895 --> 09:24.688
I don't believe this. He's gonna be here.

09:24.856 --> 09:26.565
Great. You can watch it upstairs.

09:26.733 --> 09:28.817
Upstairs? Upstairs?

09:28.985 --> 09:30.945
It doesn't have any stereo.

09:35.825 --> 09:37.201
Oh, my God.

09:37.410 --> 09:38.994
Oh, my God.

09:39.162 --> 09:42.790
David, stop stressing.
You can just, like, turn it on normally.

09:42.958 --> 09:45.417
No, I can't. It's a new TV, Jen.

09:45.585 --> 09:47.294
It doesn't work without a remote.

09:48.630 --> 09:50.673
Oh, my God, he's here.

09:58.181 --> 09:59.765
TV repair.

09:59.933 --> 10:01.141
TV repair?

10:01.309 --> 10:04.061
- Yeah. TV busted?
- Yeah.

10:04.646 --> 10:06.355
Well, here I am.

10:12.195 --> 10:15.614
Holy cow, look at that.

10:15.824 --> 10:17.700
Had a little disaster, didn't you, fella?

10:17.867 --> 10:19.159
Well, yeah, sort of.

10:19.327 --> 10:22.663
Well, we'll get you fixed up
in no time.

10:23.873 --> 10:25.624
I know how I'd feel if mine went out.

10:27.210 --> 10:29.378
Almost like losing a friend.

10:30.588 --> 10:32.965
You know, we didn't call any TV repair.

10:33.133 --> 10:36.093
That makes it a lucky day
for both of us, doesn't it?

10:36.845 --> 10:38.554
Do you think you could do this soon?

10:38.722 --> 10:40.431
- It's almost 6:30.
- What's the hurry?

10:40.598 --> 10:42.975
Pleasantville marathon starts at 6:30.

10:46.104 --> 10:50.649
Pleasantville? Gosh, I love that show.
Watched it for years.

10:50.817 --> 10:52.985
That's not the reason.
I've got a date at 6:30.

10:53.153 --> 10:55.279
Who did Muffin take
to the masquerade ball...

10:55.447 --> 10:57.990
when her date came down
with the measles?

10:58.158 --> 11:00.451
- Her father.
- That's right.

11:00.660 --> 11:03.704
- And how'd she dress him?
- As Prince Charming.

11:04.205 --> 11:06.582
Nice. Remember the one...

11:06.750 --> 11:09.918
where Bud lost his cousin when he was
supposed to be watching him?

11:10.086 --> 11:12.296
- Yeah.
- What department store did they go to?

11:12.464 --> 11:14.798
- Mclntyre's.
- McGinty's.

11:14.966 --> 11:17.676
No. Mclntyre's. Remember?

11:17.844 --> 11:20.387
For the very best in men's attire

11:20.555 --> 11:23.474
Head right down to Mclntyre's

11:26.436 --> 11:28.103
That's right.

11:31.149 --> 11:32.566
Listen...

11:35.195 --> 11:38.113
why don't you take
this remote instead?

11:38.281 --> 11:39.948
It's got a little more oomph in it.

11:40.492 --> 11:44.536
- Oomph?
- Sure. Big beautiful set like that?

11:44.704 --> 11:47.539
You want something that'll
put you right in the show.

11:53.296 --> 11:55.631
It's great. We'll take it.

11:57.592 --> 11:59.134
Thank you.

11:59.928 --> 12:01.970
Well, I better get going.

12:02.180 --> 12:03.639
Your show's almost on...

12:04.432 --> 12:06.308
and it's almost time for your date.

12:12.524 --> 12:14.191
Take care, now.

12:38.800 --> 12:40.384
Whether it's on the track...

12:40.718 --> 12:43.804
or just driving around the block,
only new Pennzoil with...

12:43.972 --> 12:45.764
For program information, just...

12:48.852 --> 12:52.271
- Honey, I'm home.
- Great.

12:52.730 --> 12:54.773
- Let me see that.
- No way.

13:06.703 --> 13:09.830
Gee whiz, Mary Sue,
why can't I borrow your radio?

13:09.998 --> 13:11.874
I promised Betty Jean she could use it.

13:12.041 --> 13:15.210
Do you mind? This is only
the most important moment of my life.

13:15.378 --> 13:18.046
Forget it, Jen. I've
waited a year for this.

13:18.214 --> 13:20.048
Come on, David, just give it to me.

13:20.216 --> 13:23.635
- Forget it!
- No way, Bud.

13:24.387 --> 13:25.721
Forget it, Mary Sue.

13:25.889 --> 13:28.515
Come on, Bud. It's mine. Give it back.

13:38.568 --> 13:40.068
Oh, my God.

13:40.236 --> 13:42.362
- What happened?
- I'm not sure.

13:45.325 --> 13:46.700
Hi, sport. Hi, Muffin.

13:46.868 --> 13:50.078
Better get a move on.
You'll be late for school.

13:51.331 --> 13:53.916
- What did you do?
- I don't know.

13:55.502 --> 13:57.920
Look at me. I'm pasty.

13:58.087 --> 14:00.422
Psst. Over here.

14:01.382 --> 14:02.966
Told you it was your lucky day.

14:03.134 --> 14:05.344
I bet you thought
I was just a fan or something.

14:05.512 --> 14:07.179
- What happened?
- A miracle.

14:07.347 --> 14:09.431
Every time I thought
I'd found someone...

14:09.599 --> 14:13.352
they'd turn out to disappoint me.
They'd know all the early episodes...

14:13.520 --> 14:16.400
but they wouldn't know the later ones.
They'd know all about Muffin...

14:16.564 --> 14:18.273
but they wouldn't know about Bud.

14:18.441 --> 14:19.650
What the hell is going on?

14:20.068 --> 14:21.985
Shh. Can't talk like that here.

14:22.153 --> 14:25.280
You're in... Well, you know.

14:25.448 --> 14:28.450
Bud, Mary Sue, breakfast is on the table.

14:28.618 --> 14:30.577
We're in Pleasantville?

14:31.037 --> 14:32.704
A dream come true, huh?

14:32.872 --> 14:34.414
Listen, this really isn't funny.

14:34.582 --> 14:37.000
I have a very important date
in five minutes.

14:37.168 --> 14:39.169
You don't have to worry
about that anymore.

14:43.383 --> 14:45.384
- Bitch.
- No!

14:45.552 --> 14:47.344
You have got to get us out of here.

14:47.512 --> 14:49.638
- Why would I do that?
- Because we don't belong.

14:49.806 --> 14:53.058
Oh, sure, you do.
Mclntyre's department store.

14:53.226 --> 14:57.104
Their father dressed as Prince Charming.
That was gorgeous, Bud.

14:57.272 --> 15:00.023
- My name is David.
- Oh, God.

15:00.191 --> 15:02.859
This is a strange way
of showing your appreciation.

15:03.027 --> 15:05.404
Hey, we appreciate it. We really do.

15:05.572 --> 15:06.822
We just wanna go home now.

15:06.990 --> 15:10.242
But you don't know how long
I've been looking for someone like you.

15:11.202 --> 15:13.495
I'm very disappointed.

15:13.663 --> 15:16.081
In fact, I'm starting
to get a little upset.

15:16.249 --> 15:17.708
No, don't get upset.

15:17.875 --> 15:20.544
Well, wouldn't you?
You look for someone for years.

15:20.712 --> 15:23.046
You pour your heart into it.

15:23.214 --> 15:25.549
This is a privilege, you know.

15:25.717 --> 15:28.260
I don't think I better
talk about this now.

15:28.428 --> 15:29.595
Where are you going?

15:29.804 --> 15:33.181
I don't think we should discuss this
until I'm more composed.

15:33.349 --> 15:34.433
Wait a minute.

15:34.601 --> 15:37.144
Maybe in a while
when I'm not so emotional.

15:37.353 --> 15:40.856
Give you a week or two
to change your attitude.

15:41.024 --> 15:42.024
Come back!

15:43.443 --> 15:45.027
Come back!

15:50.199 --> 15:51.283
A week or two?

15:51.451 --> 15:52.993
Think Mom and Da?

15:53.161 --> 15:54.202
Being silly.

15:54.370 --> 15:56.038
From day to day.

15:57.498 --> 16:01.126
- Oh, God.
- What's gonna happen?

16:01.336 --> 16:04.004
I don't know. It's not possible.
Is it possible?

16:04.172 --> 16:07.424
Bud, Mary Sue,
your breakfast is getting cold.

16:08.551 --> 16:10.552
It can't be possible.

16:21.397 --> 16:23.482
Well, come on, kids.

16:23.650 --> 16:27.569
You're not going off to school
without a hot breakfast inside you.

16:29.197 --> 16:30.572
Forward march.

16:50.093 --> 16:52.719
I just love you in that sweater, Mary Sue.

16:52.887 --> 16:55.138
It's so flattering.

16:55.306 --> 16:57.057
Thanks.

17:00.269 --> 17:04.481
Morning, kids. Better get a move on,
or you'll be late for school.

17:04.648 --> 17:07.651
- I don't believe this.
- Neither do I.

17:07.819 --> 17:09.903
Well, come on, dig in.

17:10.070 --> 17:13.448
I put blueberries in them
just the way you like.

17:15.201 --> 17:17.368
Well, come on, sweetie.
It's getting late.

17:18.746 --> 17:22.165
Actually, I'm not hungry.

17:24.292 --> 17:26.294
Nonsense, young lady.

17:26.462 --> 17:30.716
You're gonna start your day off with
a nice big breakfast. Here we go. Sit down.

17:32.635 --> 17:35.804
Here's some pancakes and eggs.

17:37.140 --> 17:41.977
Sausage and some good crisp bacon.

17:44.397 --> 17:46.940
And, of course, a ham steak.

17:50.486 --> 17:53.613
You eat on up,
then it's right off to school.

18:01.706 --> 18:03.540
Hurry, hurry.

18:13.301 --> 18:15.218
I'm gonna hurl, David, I swear to God.

18:15.386 --> 18:16.887
Just take deep breaths.

18:17.054 --> 18:20.640
It's all that animal fat.
I can feel it in my pores.

18:20.808 --> 18:22.684
I still don't see why
we're doing this.

18:22.852 --> 18:24.436
We're supposed to be in school.

18:24.604 --> 18:26.354
We're supposed to be at home, David.

18:26.522 --> 18:28.899
- We're supposed to be in color.
- Okay, okay, okay.

18:29.066 --> 18:31.276
- God.
- Hello, Bud.

18:32.612 --> 18:34.321
Hello, Mr. Simpson.

18:34.489 --> 18:36.156
Hear your dad got a new car.

18:37.700 --> 18:40.660
Oh, yeah. A Buick. It's swell.

18:41.204 --> 18:42.621
Great.

18:44.415 --> 18:46.249
Do you know that guy?

18:46.417 --> 18:49.336
Yeah. He owns the hardware store.

18:49.587 --> 18:51.338
You listen to me for just a minute.

18:51.506 --> 18:53.586
I don't know what you've done,
but you better fix it.

18:53.716 --> 18:54.716
- Shh! Shh!
- Fast.

18:54.884 --> 18:57.135
I had a date with Mark,
and I bought new underwear.

18:57.303 --> 19:00.806
We have to just play along for a little
while until that guy shows up again.

19:00.973 --> 19:02.432
- Play along?
- Yes.

19:02.600 --> 19:06.061
I am Bud Parker,
and you are Mary Sue.

19:06.229 --> 19:10.398
No. No. I'm not gonna do it.
If I don't dress like this for Mom...

19:10.566 --> 19:12.984
l'm not gonna do it for you.
- We have no choice.

19:13.152 --> 19:15.654
We are stuck here
until that guy shows up again.

19:15.822 --> 19:17.697
Why can't we just explain it
to somebody?

19:18.407 --> 19:19.741
To who?

19:32.338 --> 19:34.005
Go. Go. Go.

19:42.306 --> 19:43.765
Here, kitty.

19:44.267 --> 19:46.059
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

19:46.435 --> 19:48.395
Here, kitty.

19:49.647 --> 19:51.231
Oh, God.

19:52.149 --> 19:53.483
We are.

19:54.735 --> 19:57.404
We're, like, stuck in Nerdville.

20:03.119 --> 20:07.873
I knew you'd pay a price for this. I knew you
couldn't be so hopelessly geek-ridden...

20:08.040 --> 20:12.335
for so long without suffering
some really tragic consequences.

20:13.671 --> 20:15.755
But it's just not fair.

20:16.799 --> 20:18.800
I was getting really popular.

20:19.010 --> 20:22.929
And Debbie Russell had transferred
to another school.

20:23.097 --> 20:25.557
And my skin was really great
since March.

20:25.725 --> 20:28.018
Mark Davis was finally starting
to come around.

20:28.185 --> 20:29.978
Hello, Mary Sue.

20:34.901 --> 20:37.485
What's all the commotion?
Where's the cat?

20:38.821 --> 20:40.322
Um...

20:41.365 --> 20:42.407
It's...

20:48.039 --> 20:50.665
Oh. Right.

20:53.336 --> 20:55.545
I'll see you at school, Mary Sue.

21:05.097 --> 21:06.348
Who's that?

21:07.433 --> 21:10.727
Skip Martin, captain of
the basketball team.

21:11.646 --> 21:13.396
Does he like me?

21:14.190 --> 21:16.524
As a matter of fact, he does.

21:32.458 --> 21:33.917
Those are my friends?

21:34.085 --> 21:37.879
Peggy Jane, Lisa Anne, Betty Jean.

21:38.255 --> 21:40.382
Can we do any better?

21:40.549 --> 21:42.884
I don't think so.

21:44.220 --> 21:45.720
Okay.

21:49.517 --> 21:52.310
- Mary Sue.
- Hi.

21:53.771 --> 21:57.565
Last week, class, we discussed
the geography of Main Street.

21:58.150 --> 22:01.736
This week we're going to be
talking about Elm Street.

22:01.904 --> 22:04.823
Now, can anyone tell me
the difference...

22:04.991 --> 22:07.575
between Elm Street
and Main Street?

22:07.785 --> 22:08.868
Tommy.

22:09.412 --> 22:10.954
It's not as long?

22:11.122 --> 22:13.498
That's right, Tommy. It's not as long.

22:13.708 --> 22:16.292
Also, it only has houses.

22:16.544 --> 22:20.547
So the geography of Main Street
is different...

22:20.715 --> 22:23.049
than the geography of Elm Street.

22:24.385 --> 22:25.802
Mary Sue.

22:25.970 --> 22:28.346
Yeah. What's outside of Pleasantville?

22:36.355 --> 22:37.939
I don't understand.

22:38.816 --> 22:41.192
Outside of Pleasantville.

22:41.360 --> 22:43.194
Like, what's at the end of Main Street?

22:44.905 --> 22:48.491
Mary Sue, you should know
the answer to that.

22:48.701 --> 22:53.121
The end of Main Street
is just the beginning again.

23:58.020 --> 23:59.854
Come on, men, let's go.

24:03.317 --> 24:06.653
That's it, men, keep it up.
Big game tomorrow.

24:16.997 --> 24:18.414
Bud.

24:18.833 --> 24:19.874
Hi, Bud.

24:20.084 --> 24:21.167
Hi, Skip.

24:21.335 --> 24:22.752
Hi, Bud.

24:23.712 --> 24:24.754
Hi, Skip.

24:25.047 --> 24:28.341
- Bud, can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

24:29.510 --> 24:31.219
Well...

24:31.387 --> 24:33.555
if I was to go up to your sister...

24:33.722 --> 24:35.890
What I mean is,
if I was to go up to Mary Sue...

24:36.058 --> 24:38.685
Oh, my God. Are we in that episode?

24:38.853 --> 24:41.437
- What?
- Oh, I don't believe this.

24:41.605 --> 24:42.647
What's the matter?

24:42.815 --> 24:46.317
You wanna ask her out tonight, and then
you wanna give her your school pin.

24:46.485 --> 24:48.736
Yeah. How'd you know?

24:50.072 --> 24:54.576
Look, Skip, I don't think
it's a real good time for that right now.

24:55.786 --> 24:56.911
What do you mean?

24:57.079 --> 25:00.165
Well, what I mean is...

25:00.332 --> 25:03.293
Mary Sue's a little different lately.

25:03.919 --> 25:05.962
She won't go out with me?

25:06.130 --> 25:08.673
No, no. Hey. I didn't say that.
It's just that she's...

25:08.841 --> 25:12.135
I don't know what I'd do
if she wouldn't go out with me.

25:30.321 --> 25:32.906
Come here, guys.
Don't touch it. Stay back.

25:33.699 --> 25:35.408
I'm sure we'll work something out.

25:36.744 --> 25:38.953
- I thought you liked him.
- Yeah, but I don't know.

25:39.121 --> 25:41.748
One date, Jen. Please.
That's all I'm asking.

25:41.957 --> 25:45.543
If you don't go out with this guy,
we could throw their universe out of whack.

25:45.711 --> 25:48.087
It's too weird.
This place gives me the creeps.

25:48.255 --> 25:50.131
- Did you know the books are blank?
- What?

25:50.299 --> 25:53.176
I was in the library.
They have covers and nothing inside.

25:53.344 --> 25:55.053
What were you doing in a library?

25:55.221 --> 25:58.056
I got lost. Oh, wait. Look at this.

25:58.224 --> 26:01.100
Know why the firemen
only rescue cats out of trees?

26:01.268 --> 26:03.019
- Nothing burns around here.
- Jen, stop.

26:03.187 --> 26:06.648
They don't even need firemen.
I could really use a cigarette too.

26:06.857 --> 26:10.276
Jen, listen. I will get us out of here.

26:10.486 --> 26:12.737
I really will.
But if we don't play along...

26:12.905 --> 26:17.116
we can alter their whole existence,
and then we may never get home.

26:18.494 --> 26:21.955
You really think anybody's gonna notice if I
don't have a chocolate malt with this guy?

26:25.292 --> 26:27.001
You won't believe what we heard.

26:27.169 --> 26:28.503
Skip Martin is gonna ask you out.

26:28.671 --> 26:30.797
- And that's not all.
- No, that's not all.

26:30.965 --> 26:33.591
He's gonna give you his pin.

26:37.554 --> 26:39.681
Are you sure I'm supposed to wear this?

26:40.349 --> 26:42.350
I could kill a guy with these things.

26:42.518 --> 26:44.352
It's in your closet.

26:44.520 --> 26:46.062
I've worn kinky stuff before...

26:46.230 --> 26:49.023
- He won't notice anyway.
- Why not?

26:49.191 --> 26:52.235
They just don't notice
that kind of thing around here.

26:53.737 --> 26:56.364
- So, what's the point?
- Jen, please.

26:56.532 --> 26:58.866
Hello. I've got 3 pounds
of underwire on here.

26:59.034 --> 27:01.953
Just go with the program, huh?
I'm late for work.

27:02.329 --> 27:03.371
Work?

27:14.008 --> 27:15.049
Bud.

27:15.217 --> 27:18.678
Yeah. Yeah. Sorry.
I just had to help my folks...

27:18.887 --> 27:21.055
and then I couldn't find my hat.

27:21.223 --> 27:24.392
Oh. I didn't know what to do.

27:25.311 --> 27:26.352
What's wrong?

27:27.021 --> 27:29.397
Well, I always
wipe down the counter...

27:29.565 --> 27:31.941
and then you set out
the napkins and glasses...

27:32.109 --> 27:34.777
and then I make the French fries, and...
- Yeah.

27:35.237 --> 27:39.032
But you didn't come,
so I just kept on wiping.

27:44.747 --> 27:46.331
I'm sorry.

27:47.166 --> 27:49.042
Yeah, well... Ha, ha.

27:50.753 --> 27:51.753
Um...

27:52.129 --> 27:55.340
You know, if this ever happens again...

27:58.135 --> 27:59.927
you can make the fries...

28:00.095 --> 28:02.180
even if I haven't put out
the napkins yet.

28:02.765 --> 28:04.098
Oh.

28:05.517 --> 28:07.101
Thank you.

28:33.295 --> 28:36.923
- There aren't any cheeseburgers.
- What?

28:37.091 --> 28:40.093
Usually, I put out the burger,
and you finish with the lettuce.

28:40.302 --> 28:44.389
- Okay, listen. Do you have the lettuce?
- Yeah.

28:44.598 --> 28:47.600
- Have you cooked the burgers?
- Yeah.

28:47.768 --> 28:49.685
Put on the lettuce,
finish the burger...

28:49.853 --> 28:52.647
and pretend it was me doing it
the whole time.

28:53.607 --> 28:55.817
Yeah. You can do it, really.

28:56.402 --> 28:57.860
Okay.

29:13.085 --> 29:15.837
I sure am glad you said
you'd come out with me tonight.

29:16.004 --> 29:18.965
Oh, well, gee whiz, Skip.
I sure am glad you asked me.

29:19.508 --> 29:24.762
I don't know if I ever said this
to you before, but, well...

29:24.930 --> 29:28.015
I think you're just about
the keenest girl in the whole school.

29:28.183 --> 29:30.101
Really, Skip? The keenest?

29:30.853 --> 29:32.311
Oh, yeah.

29:33.397 --> 29:35.648
What can I get you two?

29:36.150 --> 29:37.817
I don't know, Bud.

29:37.985 --> 29:40.778
I guess I'll have my usual:
Cheeseburger and a cherry Coke.

29:41.530 --> 29:45.741
Oh, I don't know, Bud. I guess I'll
have a salad and an Evian water.

29:48.579 --> 29:50.455
Cheeseburger it is.

29:52.749 --> 29:56.002
You see, the whole time
we were in Civics together...

29:56.170 --> 29:58.713
I really wanted to come over
and sit next to you...

29:58.881 --> 30:02.383
but you were always sitting between
Lisa Anne and Peggy Jane.

30:02.885 --> 30:05.887
And you always seemed
so smart and everything.

30:06.096 --> 30:09.140
Like that report you did
on our town hall.

30:09.308 --> 30:12.393
Gosh. I didn't know
what I'd talk to you about.

30:12.811 --> 30:17.523
Yeah. Well, sometimes
talking's overrated.

30:17.691 --> 30:19.609
Don't you think?

30:19.943 --> 30:20.985
Huh?

30:22.321 --> 30:23.571
Oh, right.

30:25.157 --> 30:27.992
So I know I haven't been steady
with anybody or anything...

30:28.160 --> 30:29.952
but I just don't wanna rush it.

30:30.120 --> 30:32.705
I mean, there's kids
that are holding hands already...

30:32.873 --> 30:37.043
but I figure there's plenty of time
for that kind of thing later on, don't you?

30:38.003 --> 30:42.131
Yeah. Can you excuse me
for just a second?

30:54.686 --> 30:56.145
God.

30:56.563 --> 30:58.523
Oh, God.

31:00.025 --> 31:02.025
- Did he give it to you?
- I bet he gave it to you.

31:02.110 --> 31:03.569
I don't think he knows how.

31:04.238 --> 31:06.447
I bet he's gonna take her
to Lovers' Lane.

31:06.615 --> 31:08.366
I bet he is. I bet he is.

31:08.575 --> 31:10.535
I bet he's even gonna hold her hand.

31:10.702 --> 31:12.119
Ohh!

31:20.671 --> 31:24.173
So, anyhow, I really wanted
to sit next to you in Civics, but...

31:24.341 --> 31:26.592
- You wanna get out of here?
- What?

31:26.760 --> 31:29.303
Do you wanna leave?
Do you wanna go somewhere?

31:29.471 --> 31:30.846
But where could we go?

31:31.515 --> 31:36.018
Lovers' Lane?

31:36.186 --> 31:40.106
Yeah, Lovers' Lane. You up for it?

31:41.233 --> 31:44.360
Come on.

31:52.286 --> 31:53.578
Oh, shit.

31:54.121 --> 31:55.538
Jennifer!

31:56.832 --> 32:00.084
Jennifer, stop! Stop!

32:00.252 --> 32:02.795
You can't do this, Jennifer!
He doesn't exist!

32:02.963 --> 32:06.424
You can't do this to someone
who doesn't exist!

32:12.764 --> 32:14.307
It sure is pretty.

32:14.725 --> 32:18.019
Oh, yeah. Gorgeous.

32:19.730 --> 32:22.106
To be honest, Mary Sue...

32:22.274 --> 32:25.776
I didn't think you'd wanna come here
until we'd been pinned for a while.

32:25.944 --> 32:29.614
Oh, Skip, you can pin me
anytime you want to.

32:33.535 --> 32:35.494
Or maybe I should just pin you.

32:37.164 --> 32:40.541
That's silly, Mary Sue.
How could you possibly pin me?

33:02.022 --> 33:04.398
Bud? Son, what's wrong?

33:04.733 --> 33:06.150
Have you seen Mary Sue?

33:06.318 --> 33:09.612
Why, no. She's still on her date with Skip.
Is something the matter?

33:09.780 --> 33:11.989
No. No. I was just worried about her.

33:19.498 --> 33:22.249
Bud, your sister's getting older now...

33:22.417 --> 33:24.669
and she'll naturally
be going out with boys.

33:26.046 --> 33:27.755
But she's a fine young woman.

33:27.923 --> 33:30.883
She would never do anything
for us to be concerned about.

33:32.844 --> 33:34.303
Honest.

33:51.655 --> 33:54.115
I think I better go home now, Mary Sue.

33:54.282 --> 33:55.366
Why?

33:55.617 --> 33:58.786
I think I might be ill.

34:00.247 --> 34:01.622
Something's happening to me.

34:02.833 --> 34:04.542
That's supposed to happen.

34:06.128 --> 34:07.670
It is?

34:08.797 --> 34:10.630
Yeah. Trust me.

34:13.051 --> 34:14.552
Do you want some more cookies?

34:16.221 --> 34:17.679
No, thanks. I'm fine.

34:20.183 --> 34:23.101
How about
some marshmallow rice squares?

34:23.311 --> 34:24.520
Those are swell.

34:24.688 --> 34:26.772
No, I'm fine, thank you.

34:28.275 --> 34:30.484
- Now, who could that be?
- I've got it.

34:34.697 --> 34:36.031
- Oh, hi.
- Hi there.

34:36.199 --> 34:38.534
You took off so quick,
I wasn't sure you were okay.

34:38.702 --> 34:41.829
Oh, yeah. No, I'm fine.
I just... I had to get home early.

34:41.996 --> 34:45.750
Bud, you know how when we close up...

34:45.917 --> 34:48.627
I close the register,
then you lower the blinds...

34:48.795 --> 34:51.034
and I turn out the lights,
and we both lock the doors?

34:51.172 --> 34:55.551
- Yeah.
- Well, you weren't around this time...

34:55.761 --> 35:00.890
so I did the whole thing by myself.

35:02.517 --> 35:04.018
Wow.

35:04.436 --> 35:08.522
And not only that,
I didn't even do it in the same order.

35:08.732 --> 35:13.402
First I lowered the blinds,
then I closed the register. And...

35:16.031 --> 35:17.573
Oh, hello, Betty.

35:18.283 --> 35:19.658
Hello, Bill.

35:25.165 --> 35:27.833
Okay, well, that's great.
Thank you for stopping by.

35:28.001 --> 35:30.044
I... You know, I appreciate it.

35:34.341 --> 35:36.050
I'll see you tomorrow.

35:37.594 --> 35:41.055
Well, gee, thanks, Skip.
I sure had a wonderful time.

35:44.559 --> 35:45.851
Me too.

35:46.937 --> 35:48.270
Night.

36:04.329 --> 36:06.247
Hello, Mr. Johnson.

36:06.414 --> 36:08.123
Oh, hello, Mary Sue.

36:09.376 --> 36:12.127
- What did you do to him?
- Nothing.

36:12.295 --> 36:15.339
What do you mean, "nothing"?
That's not nothing.

36:15.549 --> 36:18.843
Why don't you relax, Bud?
We had a nice time.

36:20.178 --> 36:23.681
I am really sleepy, and I have to wake up
early in the morning to go to school.

36:23.849 --> 36:25.975
So night.

37:05.265 --> 37:06.932
Pleasure.

37:08.894 --> 37:11.562
Hi. Looks like it's gonna be
another beautiful sunny day.

37:11.730 --> 37:14.315
High 72, low 72,
not a cloud in the sky.

37:14.482 --> 37:15.608
Bud?

37:17.027 --> 37:19.987
It's 8:00 in the morning.
Are you watching television?

37:48.516 --> 37:49.516
Oh, no.

37:50.852 --> 37:52.603
Come on, men. Let's get in positions.

37:52.771 --> 37:55.481
We got a big game next week. Let's go.

37:55.649 --> 37:57.191
Come on.

38:03.406 --> 38:05.032
Oh, my God.

38:06.076 --> 38:09.078
You can't do this, Jennifer. I warned you.

38:09.245 --> 38:10.371
So, what's the big deal?

38:10.538 --> 38:13.332
Oh, okay. They're not good
at basketball anymore.

38:13.500 --> 38:15.834
- My God. What a tragedy.
- You don't understand.

38:16.002 --> 38:18.337
You're messing with
their whole goddamn universe.

38:18.505 --> 38:21.423
Maybe it needs to be messed with.
Did that ever occur to you?

38:21.591 --> 38:25.219
- Hey, M.S. How you doing?
- Cool, P.J. How are you doing?

38:26.012 --> 38:29.390
- Cool. Cool.
- Cool.

38:29.557 --> 38:32.476
"Cool"? What are you doing
to these people? You can't do this.

38:32.644 --> 38:35.104
- If I don't, who will?
- But they're happy like this.

38:35.271 --> 38:38.691
No. David, nobody is happy
in a poodle skirt and a sweater set.

38:40.735 --> 38:42.194
You really like this, don't you?

38:43.238 --> 38:46.198
No, it's not like
you think it's funny or dorky.

38:46.408 --> 38:48.200
You, like, really like it.

38:48.368 --> 38:49.785
No. You have it all wrong.

38:49.953 --> 38:51.537
I am mortified to be your sister.

38:51.705 --> 38:53.580
You have no right to do this to them.

38:53.790 --> 38:55.249
Listen to me for just a minute.

38:55.417 --> 38:58.377
These people don't wanna be geeks.
They wanna be attractive.

38:58.545 --> 39:00.796
They have potential.
They just don't know better.

39:00.964 --> 39:02.464
They don't have that potential.

39:02.632 --> 39:05.217
Oh, yeah? Look at that.

39:08.847 --> 39:11.140
Wow. What happened to your gum?

39:11.433 --> 39:12.474
I gotta go.

39:12.642 --> 39:14.727
I'm gonna meet Skip at the flagpole.

39:53.475 --> 39:54.850
Mm-hm.

39:55.894 --> 39:57.144
Hm.

39:57.687 --> 40:00.314
Well, I don't think
it's anything to worry about.

40:00.482 --> 40:02.691
You cut down on greasy foods
and chocolate.

40:02.859 --> 40:04.777
You know, things like that.

40:04.986 --> 40:07.529
It'll probably just clear up on its own.

40:13.328 --> 40:15.245
Jesus Christ.

40:41.189 --> 40:44.316
Do you think we could have
two cheeseburgers and some cherry Cokes?

40:47.112 --> 40:48.487
I'll be right with you.

40:49.280 --> 40:50.697
Thanks.

40:56.746 --> 40:59.456
Two cheeseburgers,
two cherry Cokes.

41:02.460 --> 41:04.628
There aren't any cheeseburgers.

41:08.925 --> 41:12.302
- I thought we talked about this. I thought...
- What's the point, Bud?

41:14.013 --> 41:16.140
You make hamburgers.
That is the point.

41:16.307 --> 41:21.895
No, I know. I know I do.
But it's always the same, you know?

41:22.814 --> 41:25.607
Grill the bun, flip the meat,
melt the cheese. Never changes.

41:25.775 --> 41:29.027
- It never gets any better or worse.
- Okay, just listen for a sec.

41:29.195 --> 41:31.572
The night when I closed by myself
was different.

41:31.739 --> 41:33.657
Oh, forget about that.

41:34.159 --> 41:35.993
Oh, okay.

41:37.245 --> 41:39.037
I really liked it, though.

41:41.166 --> 41:42.749
Come here.

41:47.088 --> 41:48.088
Look.

41:48.631 --> 41:50.966
You can't always like what you do.

41:51.176 --> 41:54.219
Sometimes you just gotta do it
because it's your job.

41:54.387 --> 41:57.347
And even if you don't like it,
you just gotta do it anyway.

41:57.974 --> 42:01.143
- Why?
- So they can have their hamburgers.

42:01.936 --> 42:04.021
- Oh.
- I'm sorry.

42:04.189 --> 42:05.480
You know what I really like?

42:06.232 --> 42:08.567
- What's that?
- Christmastime.

42:10.069 --> 42:11.695
See, every year, on December 3rd...

42:11.863 --> 42:14.448
I get to paint Christmas decorations
on the window...

42:14.616 --> 42:17.701
and every year I get to paint
a different thing.

42:17.869 --> 42:19.328
Here, I'll show you.

42:25.335 --> 42:26.543
Wow. That's pretty good.

42:26.711 --> 42:28.629
Thanks. But this morning
I was thinking...

42:28.796 --> 42:31.340
and I realized that
I look forward to it all year.

42:31.507 --> 42:33.258
I thought, "That seems awfully silly.

42:33.426 --> 42:36.803
It seems like an awfully long time
to be waiting for just one moment."

42:36.971 --> 42:38.305
Don't you think?

42:39.557 --> 42:41.391
Well, don't you?

42:43.061 --> 42:46.230
I think that you should try not
to think about that anymore.

42:47.482 --> 42:48.941
Okay.

42:49.108 --> 42:50.776
I'll try that, then.

42:53.696 --> 42:55.322
- Morning, Jim.
- How are you?

42:55.490 --> 42:56.823
Awfully nice.

42:56.991 --> 42:58.492
Have they ever lost before?

42:58.660 --> 43:00.827
Basketball? No, they sure haven't.

43:00.995 --> 43:03.330
It just feels wrong, that's all.

43:03.539 --> 43:05.624
Maybe that's where
they get that saying:

43:05.792 --> 43:07.334
"Can't win them all."

43:07.543 --> 43:10.045
That's a good point, Ralph.
They do have that saying.

43:10.213 --> 43:13.632
But they do win them all.
They've always won them all.

43:14.884 --> 43:17.177
Oh, Mr. Mayor. Here. Here. Go ahead.

43:17.345 --> 43:21.807
Oh, don't be silly, Roy.
I couldn't possibly take your spot.

43:23.685 --> 43:26.687
What I wanna know is,
if they've never lost before...

43:26.854 --> 43:30.565
and they've never tied before,
isn't that what you call winning them all?

43:32.151 --> 43:34.194
- He's right. That's what you call it.
- Yeah.

43:34.362 --> 43:36.196
- They have called it that.
- That's true.

43:36.781 --> 43:38.782
He said it would clear up
on its own...

43:38.950 --> 43:41.368
if she just stayed away
from fried foods and sweets.

43:43.538 --> 43:48.000
Except it's spread to her lips now too.

43:48.876 --> 43:50.294
Oh, I don't know.

43:51.379 --> 43:54.089
And you say it was just red?

43:54.257 --> 43:57.551
Well, you know, like real red.

43:57.719 --> 43:59.177
I know what you mean.

43:59.387 --> 44:03.056
That's like this car that was in front
of Bill Johnson's soda shop.

44:03.224 --> 44:06.226
I was going by it the other day,
and it looked green.

44:06.436 --> 44:07.894
Real green.

44:08.062 --> 44:11.481
Have you seen him lately?
I was getting my sewing machine fixed...

44:11.649 --> 44:16.153
and he was sitting in the window
of his shop just staring.

44:16.321 --> 44:18.530
That is strange.

44:31.252 --> 44:32.919
It's your bid, Betty.

44:39.635 --> 44:41.678
- Mary Sue.
- Yeah?

44:43.056 --> 44:45.640
What goes on up at Lovers' Lane?

44:46.517 --> 44:48.393
What do you mean?

44:48.561 --> 44:51.521
Well, you hear these things lately.

44:51.689 --> 44:54.274
Kids spending so much time up there.

44:54.442 --> 44:57.444
Is it holding hands? That kind of thing?

44:57.653 --> 44:59.279
- Yeah.
- Hm.

44:59.447 --> 45:00.697
That and...

45:01.616 --> 45:02.824
What?

45:05.036 --> 45:06.078
It doesn't matter.

45:06.245 --> 45:08.455
No. I wanna know.

45:11.292 --> 45:12.793
Well...

45:12.960 --> 45:14.169
sex.

45:15.630 --> 45:17.089
Ohh.

45:19.592 --> 45:21.134
What's sex?

45:27.225 --> 45:29.142
- You sure you wanna know this?
- Yes.

45:31.187 --> 45:32.646
Okay.

45:33.564 --> 45:34.856
Well...

45:35.441 --> 45:36.983
You see, Mom...

45:37.151 --> 45:40.445
when two people really love
each other very, very much...

45:40.613 --> 45:44.282
and they wanna share that
with each other...

45:44.700 --> 45:47.035
that's what it's like to have sex.

45:51.582 --> 45:53.208
Are you okay?

45:54.502 --> 45:55.752
Yes.

45:57.672 --> 45:59.589
It's just that...

46:02.009 --> 46:05.262
your father would never do
anything like that.

46:06.931 --> 46:08.390
Ohh.

46:09.100 --> 46:10.517
Hmm.

46:12.937 --> 46:14.938
Well, you know, Mom...

46:15.148 --> 46:18.150
there are other ways
to enjoy yourself...

46:18.317 --> 46:20.277
without Dad.

46:34.208 --> 46:35.333
Ahh.

46:36.711 --> 46:38.879
Sweetie, you coming to bed?

46:41.382 --> 46:43.717
Yeah. I'm just going to take a bath first.

47:20.880 --> 47:28.880
Oh, my goodness.

47:39.023 --> 47:42.859
Oh. Oh. Oh.

47:50.368 --> 47:51.576
Oh.

47:51.744 --> 47:59.744
Oh, my. Oh, my.

48:07.718 --> 48:09.052
What are you making?

48:09.220 --> 48:10.929
Oh, shit.

48:16.143 --> 48:17.727
Oh, God.

48:24.402 --> 48:32.402
Fire!

48:47.550 --> 48:48.842
Cat?

48:59.228 --> 49:01.021
Okay, right here.

49:01.188 --> 49:03.440
All right, stop.

49:03.608 --> 49:05.191
Stop!

49:09.655 --> 49:10.822
Where is it?

49:11.032 --> 49:12.198
Whoa!

49:21.876 --> 49:23.293
Hey, here, grab the nozzle.

49:23.502 --> 49:26.212
- But where's the cat?
- Come on. Just hold on tight.

49:26.464 --> 49:27.797
Whoa!

49:29.342 --> 49:31.635
So that's what these things do.

49:35.056 --> 49:38.558
In honor and in recognition
of your heroism...

49:39.060 --> 49:42.854
and with great appreciation from
the citizens of Pleasantville...

49:43.064 --> 49:46.274
I am pleased to present you with
this special commendation...

49:46.442 --> 49:48.242
from the Pleasantville
Chamber of Commerce.

49:59.705 --> 50:01.706
Attaboy, Bud.

50:01.874 --> 50:03.833
Attaboy, Bud.

50:09.423 --> 50:10.465
Bud.

50:12.134 --> 50:13.343
Oh, hi.

50:13.511 --> 50:16.888
- That sure was swell.
- Well, thank you, Margaret.

50:17.056 --> 50:19.766
I baked you some of my oatmeal cookies.

50:19.975 --> 50:20.975
Oh!

50:21.143 --> 50:23.770
Oh, no, no. You baked those for Whitey.

50:23.938 --> 50:26.189
No. I baked them for you.

50:27.400 --> 50:28.983
No. You baked them for Whitey.

50:29.151 --> 50:30.777
No. I baked them for you.

50:30.945 --> 50:34.989
- No, you baked them for...
- No. I baked them for you.

50:37.618 --> 50:38.910
Thank you.

50:39.829 --> 50:41.454
Sure.

51:18.492 --> 51:19.951
- Hey.
- Hey.

51:20.244 --> 51:21.578
What's going on?

51:21.787 --> 51:25.415
I'm not sure.
They wanna ask you a question.

51:25.583 --> 51:28.918
- I didn't really know how to handle it, so...
- Okay.

51:33.174 --> 51:34.758
Hi, Bud.

51:35.843 --> 51:37.927
- How you doing?
- Hi, Bud.

51:44.268 --> 51:45.894
You wanted to ask me something?

51:50.191 --> 51:52.150
How'd you know about the fire?

51:52.359 --> 51:53.985
What?

51:57.031 --> 51:59.157
How'd you know
how to put it out and all?

51:59.950 --> 52:01.201
Oh.

52:02.244 --> 52:07.165
Well, where I used to live,
that's just what firemen did.

52:10.795 --> 52:12.545
And where's that?

52:15.966 --> 52:17.383
Um...

52:19.303 --> 52:21.554
Outside of Pleasantville.

52:27.645 --> 52:29.729
Well, what's outside of Pleasantville?

52:31.315 --> 52:33.358
It doesn't matter. It's not important.

52:34.276 --> 52:36.528
What's outside of Pleasantville?

52:57.675 --> 52:59.926
There are some places...

53:00.094 --> 53:04.013
that the road doesn't go
in a circle.

53:04.223 --> 53:06.891
There are some places
where the road keeps going.

53:07.059 --> 53:12.438
Keeps going?

53:13.482 --> 53:19.571
Yeah. Yeah, it just keeps going.
It all keeps going. Roads and rivers and...

53:19.738 --> 53:21.447
Like the mighty Mississippi?

53:21.824 --> 53:23.491
What?

53:30.291 --> 53:32.292
I thought the books were blank.

53:32.459 --> 53:33.918
They were.

53:34.753 --> 53:37.589
Okay. This was not my fault.

53:37.756 --> 53:39.132
They asked what it was about.

53:39.300 --> 53:41.968
I didn't remember,
because I read it back in 10th grade.

53:42.136 --> 53:45.388
When I told them what I did remember,
that's when the pages filled in.

53:46.348 --> 53:48.766
- The pages filled in?
- Mm-hm.

53:48.934 --> 53:52.520
But only up until the part with the raft,
because that's as far as I read.

53:54.523 --> 53:56.649
Do you know how it ends?

53:56.817 --> 53:59.360
- Yeah, I do.
- So how does it end?

54:06.660 --> 54:09.829
Well, okay.

54:10.164 --> 54:11.831
Let's see. They were running away.

54:11.999 --> 54:13.583
Huck and the slave.

54:13.751 --> 54:16.336
They were going up the river,
trying to get free.

54:17.212 --> 54:19.505
And, in trying to get free...

54:19.673 --> 54:23.509
they see that
they're sort of free already.

54:28.974 --> 54:30.600
Oh, my God.

54:32.937 --> 54:34.312
Wow.

54:36.190 --> 54:38.274
Hey, what about this one?

54:40.736 --> 54:42.278
Oh, yeah. Yeah. This is great.

54:42.488 --> 54:46.407
This is... This kid Holden Caulfield,
he's a really lonely kid.

54:46.575 --> 54:48.534
He gets kicked out of boarding school.

54:48.702 --> 54:50.954
And then...

55:09.139 --> 55:10.890
Sheesh. Look at them.

55:11.058 --> 55:12.850
Spreading all over the place.

55:13.018 --> 55:14.060
Look at her books.

55:15.562 --> 55:17.313
Look at her sweater.

55:18.107 --> 55:21.401
I mean, going up to that lake
all the time is one thing...

55:21.568 --> 55:24.237
but now they're going
to a library?

55:24.488 --> 55:26.280
What's next?

55:28.450 --> 55:30.076
You're right.

55:30.244 --> 55:33.413
Somebody ought
to do something about that.

55:38.711 --> 55:40.461
Soon.

55:47.594 --> 55:51.639
George, you're probably wondering
why I asked to stop by and see you today.

55:52.558 --> 55:55.101
I'm sure you've noticed
the same things we all have.

55:55.269 --> 55:58.521
Certain changes in the town.

56:00.065 --> 56:01.983
You know what I mean by changes?

56:03.527 --> 56:04.569
Changes.

56:04.862 --> 56:06.529
Yeah, changes.

56:07.448 --> 56:10.533
And I'm not just talking
about big stuff like the fire.

56:10.701 --> 56:13.036
It's the little things.
You hear about Bill Miller?

56:13.203 --> 56:14.412
No. What?

56:14.580 --> 56:16.748
Wife wants him
to get one of those new beds.

56:16.999 --> 56:19.625
- One of those big beds?
- Yeah.

56:20.502 --> 56:23.671
Oh, my gosh. What's he gonna do?

56:23.839 --> 56:25.798
I don't know. I mean, it's everywhere.

56:25.966 --> 56:28.468
Bill Anderson's boy
just quit his job at the market.

56:28.635 --> 56:29.677
What do you mean, quit?

56:29.887 --> 56:33.765
Took his apron off in the middle of an
order, said, "I don't feel like it anymore."

56:33.932 --> 56:36.350
Groceries all over the counter. Ha-ha-ha.

56:36.518 --> 56:38.478
Took them three hours
just to sort it out.

56:38.645 --> 56:40.897
- Sheesh.
- Yeah.

56:42.483 --> 56:44.692
Everybody really likes you, George.

56:44.860 --> 56:47.320
- Oh, well...
- No, they do.

56:47.488 --> 56:50.239
Not just because you're a good bowler.
People respect you.

56:50.407 --> 56:52.408
Well, thank you.

56:52.576 --> 56:55.078
It's important for them to see
someone they respect...

56:55.412 --> 56:57.080
stand up for what's right.

56:57.664 --> 57:00.416
If you love a place,
you can't just sit back...

57:00.584 --> 57:03.127
and watch this kind of thing
happen, now, can you?

57:03.837 --> 57:05.129
No, of course not.

57:05.506 --> 57:10.384
That is why I want you to be a member
of the Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce.

57:12.846 --> 57:15.014
Oh, my gosh.

57:15.265 --> 57:16.265
Oh!

57:16.683 --> 57:18.518
I hardly know what to say.

57:20.771 --> 57:22.021
It's just like yours.

57:22.189 --> 57:24.899
Well, it is exactly like mine, George.

57:26.443 --> 57:28.027
- Ohh.
- Huh.

57:28.445 --> 57:30.738
Well, you can start by saying yes.

57:31.490 --> 57:32.990
- Yes.
- And by getting me...

57:33.158 --> 57:36.828
one of those swell pineapple kabobs.
- Well, sure. You bet.

57:36.995 --> 57:40.873
Betty, Bob wants to try
some of your great hors d'oeuvres.

57:47.256 --> 57:48.714
Betty?

57:50.551 --> 57:51.801
Bett?

57:53.720 --> 57:55.555
I'll get her.

58:03.522 --> 58:05.106
Are you okay?

58:17.369 --> 58:18.828
You all right?

58:23.333 --> 58:24.750
What am I going to do?

58:27.421 --> 58:30.923
I can't go out there this way.

58:31.091 --> 58:33.676
How can I go out there this way?

58:37.431 --> 58:39.432
Look at me.

58:41.185 --> 58:44.478
It's okay. It's all right.

58:45.314 --> 58:46.689
Betty?

58:48.650 --> 58:50.359
Have you got any makeup?

58:54.740 --> 58:56.991
In my handbag.

59:02.956 --> 59:05.082
Honey, where are you?

59:06.210 --> 59:08.127
Here. Give me your cheek.

59:12.841 --> 59:14.967
Here. Give me the other. There.

59:16.803 --> 59:20.181
That's good. Now lift your chin up.

59:20.557 --> 59:22.475
- Is it working?
- Yes.

59:24.019 --> 59:25.937
Here, look at me.

59:47.334 --> 59:49.168
What?

59:50.170 --> 59:52.004
Does it look okay?

59:52.506 --> 59:54.632
Yeah. It looks just like it did.

59:57.302 --> 59:59.971
And... And they won't be able to tell?

01:00:00.514 --> 01:00:02.640
No. No, they won't be able to tell.

01:00:03.850 --> 01:00:06.143
Betty, are you in there?

01:00:23.745 --> 01:00:25.538
Coming, sweetie.

01:00:36.842 --> 01:00:38.843
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

01:00:39.011 --> 01:00:41.137
Aren't you a little bit early?

01:00:41.305 --> 01:00:45.057
I brought you something
from the library.

01:00:46.601 --> 01:00:48.227
It's an art book.

01:00:49.938 --> 01:00:51.856
Oh, my gosh, Bud.

01:00:53.025 --> 01:00:56.402
I just thought, since you like to paint,
it might help to...

01:01:11.293 --> 01:01:12.960
Gee whiz.

01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:22.136
Who is Titian?

01:01:22.554 --> 01:01:24.013
I'm not sure.

01:02:21.822 --> 01:02:23.823
It's beautiful, Bud.

01:02:30.330 --> 01:02:31.956
What's wrong?

01:02:32.999 --> 01:02:35.126
Oh, it's...

01:02:35.335 --> 01:02:37.420
I'll never be able to do that.

01:02:37.587 --> 01:02:40.047
Well, you just started.
I mean, you can't do it now.

01:02:40.215 --> 01:02:42.133
No, no, no. That's not it.

01:02:43.593 --> 01:02:46.095
Just where am I gonna see
colors like that?

01:02:48.306 --> 01:02:51.267
Must be awful lucky
to see colors like that.

01:02:53.228 --> 01:02:55.938
I'll bet they don't know
how lucky they are.

01:03:01.695 --> 01:03:03.112
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:06.198
- How are you doing?
- Swell.

01:03:06.366 --> 01:03:10.911
Look, you probably don't think
I should be asking you this.

01:03:15.542 --> 01:03:17.835
Will you go out with me tonight?

01:03:20.422 --> 01:03:21.839
Whoo!

01:03:22.174 --> 01:03:23.674
Hi there, Bud.

01:03:23.842 --> 01:03:27.386
Hey, Mr. Simpson.
Your lawn looks great.

01:03:31.725 --> 01:03:32.933
Yes.

01:03:33.977 --> 01:03:35.227
Bud.

01:03:38.565 --> 01:03:39.899
David.

01:03:44.321 --> 01:03:47.156
Well, come here, young fella.

01:03:48.492 --> 01:03:50.326
You know, I've been thinking.

01:03:50.494 --> 01:03:54.371
I might've been a little hasty the
other day when you asked to come home.

01:03:54.539 --> 01:03:58.250
It just took me by such surprise,
you know? Ha-ha-ha.

01:03:58.543 --> 01:04:01.921
So even though
I can't make any promises...

01:04:02.130 --> 01:04:04.507
well, I figured
if you asked me real nice...

01:04:04.716 --> 01:04:07.259
I might just be willing
to talk about it again.

01:04:08.428 --> 01:04:10.721
- I can't.
- What?

01:04:10.889 --> 01:04:14.058
- Talk about it right now. I mean...
- I'll be honest with you, Bud.

01:04:14.226 --> 01:04:18.270
I'm getting a little concerned about
what I'm seeing on some of these reruns.

01:04:18.647 --> 01:04:19.688
Reruns?

01:04:19.856 --> 01:04:23.609
Like when Margaret Henderson
makes her cookies for Whitey.

01:04:23.777 --> 01:04:26.695
- Those are not your cookies, Bud.
- Yes, I know.

01:04:26.863 --> 01:04:28.364
I know they are not my cookies...

01:04:28.532 --> 01:04:31.700
Those are Whitey's cookies, Bud.
They belong to him.

01:04:31.868 --> 01:04:34.537
He eats them,
then he asks her to go to Lovers' Lane...

01:04:34.704 --> 01:04:37.957
I would love to talk about this right now,
but I am really in a hurry.

01:04:38.124 --> 01:04:39.833
- Bud. Don't touch...
- I can't hear you.

01:04:40.001 --> 01:04:43.087
It's really cruddy reception.
We'll talk later.

01:04:55.433 --> 01:04:56.976
What's wrong?

01:04:58.270 --> 01:04:59.728
Listen...

01:05:01.273 --> 01:05:02.314
You're reading.

01:05:02.732 --> 01:05:05.401
I can't believe you started
such a dorky fad.

01:05:05.610 --> 01:05:07.319
It's D. H...

01:05:08.947 --> 01:05:09.989
Lawrence.

01:05:10.156 --> 01:05:11.865
- You ever heard of him?
- Yeah.

01:05:12.784 --> 01:05:15.703
Yeah, I read a couple pages.
Seemed kind of sexy.

01:05:16.079 --> 01:05:17.496
It is.

01:05:18.206 --> 01:05:21.333
Hey, can I ask you a question?

01:05:21.501 --> 01:05:22.835
Sure.

01:05:27.799 --> 01:05:30.676
- How come I'm still in black and white?
- What?

01:05:31.344 --> 01:05:35.014
I've had like 10 times as much sex
as the rest of these girls...

01:05:35.181 --> 01:05:36.932
and I still look like this.

01:05:37.100 --> 01:05:39.351
They spend an hour
in the back seat of some car...

01:05:39.519 --> 01:05:41.812
and all of a sudden
they're in Technicolor?

01:05:42.856 --> 01:05:46.525
I don't know.
Maybe it's not just the sex.

01:05:57.203 --> 01:06:00.331
- Where is it?
- A little bit farther, I think.

01:06:01.875 --> 01:06:04.877
WKPV, the sounds of Pleasantville.

01:06:05.045 --> 01:06:07.921
Here's a new one
for all you kids out at Lovers' Lane.

01:06:28.276 --> 01:06:29.818
Wow.

01:07:12.404 --> 01:07:14.530
- It's amazing, huh?
- Yeah.

01:07:53.778 --> 01:07:55.446
We're closed right now.

01:07:56.197 --> 01:07:59.742
- Oh, I'm sorry. I...
- Oh, hi.

01:07:59.993 --> 01:08:02.619
Hi. I just thought that...

01:08:02.829 --> 01:08:05.581
No, no, no. Come on in.

01:08:09.836 --> 01:08:12.171
It's beautiful.

01:08:12.422 --> 01:08:14.798
Oh. Thanks.

01:08:15.759 --> 01:08:18.343
I was just trying to do
one of these still lifes.

01:08:18.511 --> 01:08:20.345
Kind of having a tough time.

01:08:20.513 --> 01:08:23.015
Oh, I think it looks nice.

01:08:24.309 --> 01:08:27.019
Well, here's what
it's supposed to look like.

01:08:30.774 --> 01:08:31.857
Oh, my.

01:08:32.274 --> 01:08:34.109
Here. Look at this.

01:08:36.196 --> 01:08:38.363
- Where did you get this?
- Bud brought it to me.

01:08:38.531 --> 01:08:41.575
- My Bud?
- Yeah. Here's my favorite.

01:08:45.913 --> 01:08:47.956
What do you think?

01:08:48.124 --> 01:08:50.751
Isn't it great
how she's resting like that?

01:08:52.921 --> 01:08:54.712
She's crying.

01:08:54.881 --> 01:08:56.590
No, she's not.

01:08:57.926 --> 01:08:59.635
Yes, she is.

01:09:14.108 --> 01:09:16.401
- Wait. It's all right.
- No. No. I've gotta go.

01:09:16.569 --> 01:09:18.403
Let me see.

01:09:35.964 --> 01:09:40.509
It's beautiful.

01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:44.680
You shouldn't cover that up.

01:09:55.108 --> 01:09:58.026
Here. Let me... I just... Let me just...

01:11:35.375 --> 01:11:37.042
So, what's it like?

01:11:37.210 --> 01:11:39.461
- What?
- Out there.

01:11:41.297 --> 01:11:43.173
Well, it's...

01:11:44.550 --> 01:11:46.176
It's louder...

01:11:46.344 --> 01:11:50.806
and scarier, I guess.

01:11:51.015 --> 01:11:54.267
And it's a lot more dangerous.

01:11:54.686 --> 01:11:56.186
Sounds fantastic.

01:11:57.855 --> 01:12:00.482
The other night,
some kids came up here to go swimming...

01:12:00.650 --> 01:12:02.901
and they took off
all their clothes.

01:12:05.238 --> 01:12:07.114
Do you want some berries?

01:12:07.407 --> 01:12:08.407
Huh?

01:12:08.574 --> 01:12:11.076
Some berries. I picked them myself.

01:12:11.244 --> 01:12:12.494
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

01:12:12.829 --> 01:12:14.913
Yeah, there's lots of stuff.

01:12:15.081 --> 01:12:16.456
Like what?

01:12:16.624 --> 01:12:17.916
Um...

01:12:18.751 --> 01:12:20.919
Here. I'll show you.

01:12:34.308 --> 01:12:35.475
Here.

01:12:35.977 --> 01:12:37.602
Go ahead. Try it.

01:12:48.781 --> 01:12:50.365
Mary Sue.

01:12:51.117 --> 01:12:52.367
What are you doing?

01:12:52.535 --> 01:12:54.077
It's 6:30.

01:12:54.829 --> 01:12:55.871
So?

01:12:56.539 --> 01:12:58.373
We were gonna...

01:12:59.208 --> 01:13:00.500
You know.

01:13:02.128 --> 01:13:04.004
Oh. I can't.

01:13:05.506 --> 01:13:07.966
- Why not?
- I'm busy.

01:13:08.426 --> 01:13:11.887
- With what?
- I'm studying.

01:13:16.893 --> 01:13:18.101
- Evening.
- Evening.

01:13:18.269 --> 01:13:20.353
- Evening.
- Evening.

01:13:20.521 --> 01:13:22.105
Evening.

01:13:22.273 --> 01:13:24.691
- George.
- Evening, Norm.

01:13:32.366 --> 01:13:33.658
Huh.

01:13:46.089 --> 01:13:47.839
Honey, I'm home.

01:14:00.686 --> 01:14:03.021
Honey, I'm home.

01:14:16.285 --> 01:14:19.162
- What was that?
- I don't know.

01:14:42.228 --> 01:14:43.728
What is that?

01:14:45.857 --> 01:14:47.065
What's going on?

01:14:47.275 --> 01:14:48.942
It's rain.

01:14:49.110 --> 01:14:51.361
- Real rain?
- Yeah.

01:14:52.029 --> 01:14:54.322
You don't have rain either?

01:14:54.490 --> 01:14:57.409
Well, of course you don't. Hey, it's okay.

01:14:58.161 --> 01:14:59.870
Here, come on.

01:15:08.212 --> 01:15:10.255
What's going on?

01:15:10.423 --> 01:15:12.090
Rain.

01:15:13.509 --> 01:15:15.427
It's okay. It's fine.

01:15:16.053 --> 01:15:18.096
Nothing to be scared of.

01:15:20.057 --> 01:15:21.892
Here, I'll show you.

01:15:24.770 --> 01:15:28.481
It's just rain. It's okay.
It's fine. Come on out.

01:15:28.941 --> 01:15:31.651
You see? Look.

01:15:32.945 --> 01:15:34.237
You see?

01:15:36.115 --> 01:15:38.074
Come on. Come on.

01:15:38.284 --> 01:15:39.743
It's cold.

01:15:48.961 --> 01:15:50.420
Cool.

01:15:58.012 --> 01:16:00.222
Honey, I'm home.

01:16:08.648 --> 01:16:16.648
Where's my dinner?

01:17:16.549 --> 01:17:18.049
George?

01:17:21.304 --> 01:17:23.138
What happened?

01:17:24.890 --> 01:17:26.391
Are you all right?

01:17:28.060 --> 01:17:29.769
What is it?

01:17:36.319 --> 01:17:37.527
Rain.

01:17:38.446 --> 01:17:39.654
Real rain?

01:17:46.078 --> 01:17:47.954
Oh, my God.

01:17:50.708 --> 01:17:51.833
Are you all right?

01:17:53.836 --> 01:17:56.254
I came home like I always do...

01:17:56.422 --> 01:17:58.298
and I went in the front door...

01:17:58.507 --> 01:18:00.258
and I took off my coat...

01:18:00.426 --> 01:18:02.635
and I put down my briefcase...

01:18:02.803 --> 01:18:05.638
and I said, "Honey, I'm home."

01:18:05.806 --> 01:18:07.182
Only there was no one there.

01:18:09.143 --> 01:18:11.144
No wife.

01:18:11.312 --> 01:18:13.146
No lights.

01:18:15.274 --> 01:18:17.609
- No dinner.
- No dinner?

01:18:18.319 --> 01:18:19.778
I went to the oven.

01:18:19.945 --> 01:18:22.405
I thought maybe she had made
one of those TV dinners.

01:18:22.573 --> 01:18:24.699
- Yeah, sure.
- She hadn't.

01:18:25.284 --> 01:18:26.701
She was gone.

01:18:27.495 --> 01:18:30.538
I looked and looked and looked.

01:18:31.707 --> 01:18:33.208
She was gone.

01:18:34.126 --> 01:18:36.294
It's gonna be fine, George.

01:18:36.504 --> 01:18:38.463
You're with us now.

01:18:43.135 --> 01:18:44.469
What are we gonna do, Bob?

01:18:47.890 --> 01:18:51.267
Well, we're safe for now.
Thank goodness we're in a bowling alley.

01:18:52.269 --> 01:18:54.312
But if George here
doesn't get his dinner...

01:18:54.647 --> 01:18:56.689
any one of us could be next.

01:18:57.400 --> 01:18:59.150
It could be you, Gus.

01:18:59.318 --> 01:19:00.693
Or you, Roy.

01:19:00.861 --> 01:19:02.821
Or even you, Ralph.

01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:05.907
That is real rain out there, gentlemen.

01:19:06.075 --> 01:19:09.786
This isn't some little virus
that'll clear up on its own.

01:19:09.954 --> 01:19:13.248
Something is happening to our town.

01:19:14.375 --> 01:19:17.544
And I think we can all see
where it's coming from.

01:19:19.672 --> 01:19:21.172
Roy.

01:19:21.674 --> 01:19:25.009
Why don't you show them
what you showed me before?

01:19:25.845 --> 01:19:27.345
But, Bob...

01:19:27.513 --> 01:19:30.181
It's okay, Roy. Come on up here.

01:19:36.689 --> 01:19:38.314
I know, Roy.

01:19:45.698 --> 01:19:47.198
Thanks.

01:19:49.535 --> 01:19:52.328
He asked her what she was doing.

01:19:52.746 --> 01:19:54.873
She said, "Nothing."
She was just thinking.

01:19:56.584 --> 01:19:59.544
My friends, this isn't about
George's dinner.

01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:02.046
It's not about Roy's shirt.

01:20:02.214 --> 01:20:04.924
It's a question of values.

01:20:05.092 --> 01:20:08.011
It's a question of whether
we wanna hold on to those values...

01:20:08.179 --> 01:20:10.555
that made this place great.

01:20:11.265 --> 01:20:15.018
So a time has come to make a decision.

01:20:16.103 --> 01:20:18.396
Are we in this thing alone...

01:20:18.981 --> 01:20:21.274
or are we in it together?

01:20:25.112 --> 01:20:32.076
Together.

01:20:32.578 --> 01:20:34.287
- Together.
- Together.

01:20:34.455 --> 01:20:36.372
Together. Together.

01:20:36.540 --> 01:20:43.546
Together. Together. Together.

01:22:21.061 --> 01:22:22.979
- I told you where I was.
- All night?

01:22:23.147 --> 01:22:26.024
I got caught in the storm.
You were gone all night too.

01:22:26.358 --> 01:22:27.692
Look...

01:22:28.277 --> 01:22:31.529
Let's just forget about it.
We'll just go to the meeting.

01:22:31.697 --> 01:22:34.991
No. I told you, George,
I am not going to that meeting.

01:22:35.159 --> 01:22:38.328
- Sure, you are.
- No, I'm not.

01:22:39.163 --> 01:22:40.830
Look at me, George.

01:22:41.707 --> 01:22:45.460
Look at my face.
That meeting's not for me.

01:22:45.628 --> 01:22:48.880
- You'll put on some makeup.
- I don't wanna put on some makeup.

01:22:49.048 --> 01:22:53.051
It goes away. It'll go away.

01:22:53.594 --> 01:22:57.513
I don't want it to go away.

01:23:02.311 --> 01:23:04.228
Now, you listen to me.

01:23:07.274 --> 01:23:09.067
You're coming to this meeting.

01:23:09.234 --> 01:23:11.235
You're going to put on some makeup.

01:23:11.403 --> 01:23:14.072
You're going to be home
at 6:00 every night...

01:23:14.239 --> 01:23:17.867
and you're going to have dinner
ready on this table.

01:23:20.412 --> 01:23:23.998
No, I'm not, sweetie.

01:23:34.009 --> 01:23:36.803
I made you a meat loaf.

01:23:38.514 --> 01:23:42.600
Just put it in the oven
and turn this little knob up to 350.

01:23:44.436 --> 01:23:46.729
If you put the pie in
40 minutes later...

01:23:46.897 --> 01:23:49.023
it'll be hot in time for dessert.

01:23:50.234 --> 01:23:51.484
Um...

01:23:52.111 --> 01:23:55.780
I made a couple of lunches
for you for tomorrow...

01:23:56.198 --> 01:23:58.574
and put them in brown paper bags.

01:24:03.497 --> 01:24:05.248
I'm going to go now.

01:24:05.416 --> 01:24:07.417
Where are you gonna go?

01:24:09.086 --> 01:24:10.753
I'm going to go now.

01:24:14.007 --> 01:24:17.719
Betty, don't go out there like that.
They'll see you.

01:24:17.886 --> 01:24:19.220
They'll see you.

01:24:19.388 --> 01:24:22.223
Betty, come back here.

01:24:23.225 --> 01:24:25.101
It's beautiful. Can I open it?

01:24:25.269 --> 01:24:26.728
Sure.

01:24:29.982 --> 01:24:31.441
Where'd you get it?

01:24:31.608 --> 01:24:33.693
It was a prop from the school play.

01:24:38.532 --> 01:24:40.074
Thank you.

01:24:51.879 --> 01:24:54.338
Hello, Bud. Hello, Margaret.

01:24:54.965 --> 01:24:56.048
Whitey.

01:24:56.550 --> 01:25:00.011
Hey, Bud, why aren't you
at the town meeting right now?

01:25:00.345 --> 01:25:01.804
No reason. How come you're not?

01:25:02.222 --> 01:25:03.264
Oh.

01:25:03.432 --> 01:25:06.184
We're supposed to go around
and let everyone know about it.

01:25:06.351 --> 01:25:08.686
I thought maybe it was because
you were too busy...

01:25:08.854 --> 01:25:10.688
entertaining your colored girlfriend.

01:25:12.149 --> 01:25:14.484
Hey, why don't you guys
get the hell out of here?

01:25:14.985 --> 01:25:17.904
All right. We'll do that.

01:25:19.656 --> 01:25:21.532
You know, Margaret,
you can come over...

01:25:21.700 --> 01:25:25.745
and make those oatmeal cookies for me
anytime you want to.

01:25:31.126 --> 01:25:32.168
People.

01:25:33.962 --> 01:25:37.173
- People.
- Roy Campbell's got a blue front door.

01:25:37.341 --> 01:25:40.009
- It's always been blue.
- People.

01:25:40.677 --> 01:25:42.804
People, please.

01:25:43.597 --> 01:25:44.680
Please.

01:25:47.100 --> 01:25:49.602
I think we all know
what's been going on here.

01:25:50.062 --> 01:25:51.312
Up until now...

01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:55.942
everything around here
has always been, well, pleasant.

01:25:57.319 --> 01:26:00.863
Recently, certain things
have become unpleasant.

01:26:01.031 --> 01:26:05.660
- Hear, hear.
- Now, it seems to me...

01:26:05.828 --> 01:26:08.538
that the first thing
we have to do...

01:26:08.747 --> 01:26:11.415
is to separate out the things
that are pleasant...

01:26:11.583 --> 01:26:13.459
from the things that are unpleasant.

01:27:18.692 --> 01:27:22.987
- That's Betty Parker.
- That is an outrage.

01:27:39.630 --> 01:27:42.048
What the hell do you think you're doing?

01:27:42.215 --> 01:27:44.467
Get in here. Now.

01:27:48.347 --> 01:27:49.972
You think this is a toy?

01:27:50.182 --> 01:27:52.642
You think it's your own little
goddamn coloring book?

01:27:52.809 --> 01:27:56.520
- Look, it just sort of happened.
- A deluge doesn't just happen.

01:27:56.688 --> 01:27:58.856
Bolts of lightning don't just happen.

01:27:59.066 --> 01:28:00.691
I didn't do anything wrong.

01:28:00.859 --> 01:28:02.818
Oh, no? Let me show you something.

01:28:03.695 --> 01:28:05.780
Go on, try it.

01:28:06.323 --> 01:28:09.867
Boom! Right there.
What do you call that, huh?

01:28:10.035 --> 01:28:11.994
You know, you don't deserve this place.

01:28:12.162 --> 01:28:14.538
You don't deserve to live in this paradise.

01:28:14.706 --> 01:28:16.916
- Where's the remote control I gave you?
- Why?

01:28:17.084 --> 01:28:19.293
Because you're coming home,
you little twerp...

01:28:19.461 --> 01:28:21.879
and I'm gonna put this place
back the way it was.

01:28:22.255 --> 01:28:24.131
- I can't let you do that.
- What?

01:28:24.299 --> 01:28:26.175
I'm sorry.
I'm not gonna let you do that.

01:28:26.343 --> 01:28:28.844
Just give me the damn remote. Ow.

01:28:29.012 --> 01:28:31.097
- I'm gonna go now.
- You're not going anywhere.

01:28:31.264 --> 01:28:33.724
You're gonna get that remote
and come home...

01:28:33.892 --> 01:28:36.060
and we're gonna make
everybody happy again.

01:28:37.604 --> 01:28:41.983
Hey. Where you going in such a hurry?
Now, that's not real friendly.

01:28:42.150 --> 01:28:45.152
- Let's see if she looks like her picture.
- She's real pretty.

01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:47.488
Yeah, you wanna be friendly, don't you?

01:28:47.656 --> 01:28:50.282
Why don't you show us
what's under that nice blue dress?

01:28:50.450 --> 01:28:51.993
Yeah, come on.

01:28:54.371 --> 01:28:57.331
Hey, where you going?
There's nowhere to go over there.

01:28:58.750 --> 01:29:01.794
You know, that is a lovely shade of blue.

01:29:02.004 --> 01:29:04.922
Don't you think that's
a lovely shade of blue?

01:29:17.269 --> 01:29:19.020
Get out of here!

01:29:19.604 --> 01:29:22.398
Go on! Go! Get out of here!

01:29:25.527 --> 01:29:27.862
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:29:33.285 --> 01:29:34.744
What?

01:31:02.666 --> 01:31:05.209
It's okay. He's not in there.

01:31:18.390 --> 01:31:21.517
Hey. Hey. It's okay. It's okay. All right?

01:31:21.685 --> 01:31:24.562
I'm gonna get you out of here, all right?

01:31:24.938 --> 01:31:26.647
Are you okay?

01:31:29.943 --> 01:31:31.569
Keep them coming.

01:31:38.493 --> 01:31:40.870
- No!
- No, Mary Sue. It's better this way.

01:31:41.037 --> 01:31:43.664
This is the only book I've ever
read in my whole life...

01:31:43.874 --> 01:31:45.875
and you're not gonna put it
on that fire.

01:31:46.042 --> 01:31:47.251
Just give me the book.

01:31:48.670 --> 01:31:50.171
Mary Sue.

01:31:52.090 --> 01:31:53.674
Jennifer.

01:31:55.260 --> 01:31:56.927
It's me.

01:32:28.418 --> 01:32:30.294
Let's go inside.

01:32:46.645 --> 01:32:48.020
Hello?

01:32:56.196 --> 01:32:59.323
Just thought I'd try to tidy it up a bit.

01:33:06.164 --> 01:33:10.000
Oh, it's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

01:33:11.086 --> 01:33:13.963
Once we sweep it up,
it'll be all right again.

01:33:20.053 --> 01:33:22.346
Yeah. Yeah.

01:33:22.722 --> 01:33:25.724
He's right. Let's...

01:33:25.892 --> 01:33:27.685
Here. Help me with this, will you?

01:33:29.229 --> 01:33:32.064
Good. Put this up in here.

01:33:36.236 --> 01:33:38.028
People.

01:33:40.240 --> 01:33:41.740
People.

01:33:43.910 --> 01:33:47.037
This is not the answer, people.

01:33:47.664 --> 01:33:50.207
No matter how upset we may get...

01:33:50.375 --> 01:33:52.918
or how frustrated we may be...

01:33:53.086 --> 01:33:55.754
we're not gonna solve our problems
out in the street.

01:33:55.922 --> 01:33:58.549
It's just the wrong way to do it.

01:33:58.717 --> 01:34:01.385
We have to find a code of conduct...

01:34:01.553 --> 01:34:03.721
that we can all agree to live by.

01:34:04.139 --> 01:34:08.892
Now, I asked George and Ralph here
to sketch out a few ideas...

01:34:09.060 --> 01:34:12.146
and I think they've done a terrific job.

01:34:12.314 --> 01:34:15.024
Now, if we can all agree to these,
we can take a vote...

01:34:15.191 --> 01:34:18.485
and I think we can start off
in the right direction.

01:34:19.821 --> 01:34:24.783
"One: All public disruption
and acts of vandalism...

01:34:24.951 --> 01:34:26.535
are to cease immediately.

01:34:27.078 --> 01:34:30.748
Two: All citizens of Pleasantville...

01:34:30.915 --> 01:34:35.919
are to treat each other
in a courteous and pleasant manner."

01:34:36.087 --> 01:34:40.007
"Courteous and pleasant manner."
Well, that's not too bad.

01:34:40.550 --> 01:34:44.261
"Three: The area commonly known
as Lovers' Lane...

01:34:44.429 --> 01:34:46.180
as well as the public library...

01:34:46.348 --> 01:34:48.599
shall be closed until further notice.

01:34:52.270 --> 01:34:55.939
Four: The only permissible recorded music
shall be the following:

01:34:56.107 --> 01:34:59.109
Johnny Mathis, Perry Como,
Jack Jones...

01:34:59.277 --> 01:35:03.364
the marches of John Philip Sousa,
or 'The Star-Spangled Banner.'

01:35:03.531 --> 01:35:06.241
In no event
shall any music be tolerated...

01:35:06.409 --> 01:35:09.453
that is not of a temperate
or pleasant nature.

01:35:11.623 --> 01:35:15.667
Five: There shall be
no public sale of umbrellas...

01:35:15.835 --> 01:35:19.129
or preparation for inclement weather
of any kind.

01:35:21.466 --> 01:35:24.510
Six: No bed frame
or mattress may be sold...

01:35:24.677 --> 01:35:27.137
measuring more than 38 inches wide.

01:35:30.475 --> 01:35:34.353
Seven: The only permissible
paint colors...

01:35:36.689 --> 01:35:38.399
shall be black, white, or gray...

01:35:38.566 --> 01:35:42.152
despite the recent availability
of certain alternatives.

01:35:44.030 --> 01:35:47.282
Eight: All elementary
and high-school curriculum...

01:35:47.450 --> 01:35:51.161
shall teach the non-changeist
view of history...

01:35:51.329 --> 01:35:54.665
emphasizing continuity
over alteration."

01:35:57.502 --> 01:35:58.752
Wow.

01:36:00.839 --> 01:36:03.257
Hey. This thing still works.

01:36:04.926 --> 01:36:08.011
Turn that off.
You're not allowed to do that now.

01:36:15.145 --> 01:36:16.937
Sure, you are.

01:37:23.755 --> 01:37:25.797
Oh, this is good.

01:37:26.257 --> 01:37:28.050
Just do it?

01:37:34.182 --> 01:37:36.600
Don't worry.
We'll get you a new one.

01:37:37.435 --> 01:37:40.771
I don't know what I'd do
if I couldn't paint anymore, Bud.

01:37:49.155 --> 01:37:51.073
Maybe I have an idea.

01:38:23.606 --> 01:38:26.275
Disgusting. It scares me.

01:38:38.705 --> 01:38:40.831
You should be ashamed of yourselves.

01:38:43.501 --> 01:38:45.586
This is disgusting.

01:40:02.455 --> 01:40:04.790
When are they gonna let them out?

01:40:04.957 --> 01:40:07.751
Hey, what are you kids doing out there?

01:40:10.213 --> 01:40:12.798
There's someone to see you, Bud.

01:40:15.426 --> 01:40:17.469
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

01:40:21.099 --> 01:40:22.265
Is this a bad time?

01:40:22.433 --> 01:40:25.560
No. No, it's fine. Come on in.

01:40:28.064 --> 01:40:31.066
- I brought you something.
- Thank you.

01:40:31.984 --> 01:40:35.278
- Cocktail olives.
- Everything else was frozen.

01:40:35.446 --> 01:40:38.281
- I didn't know how to...
- I appreciate it.

01:40:42.120 --> 01:40:44.830
- You know, your mom went out.
- Went out?

01:40:44.997 --> 01:40:47.082
Yeah. She went out for a little while.

01:40:47.959 --> 01:40:49.584
When?

01:40:50.670 --> 01:40:52.170
Three days ago.

01:40:57.635 --> 01:41:00.303
Jeez, everything is so cockeyed.

01:41:00.638 --> 01:41:03.098
I didn't even know it was Tuesday.

01:41:03.266 --> 01:41:05.976
Tuesday we play bridge
with the Jenkins.

01:41:06.144 --> 01:41:08.395
There was no bridge. It's...

01:41:12.483 --> 01:41:14.234
Can I have one of those?

01:41:14.402 --> 01:41:16.111
Sure. Yeah. You hungry?

01:41:17.822 --> 01:41:21.199
Mrs. Benson was making
meat loaf next door.

01:41:21.367 --> 01:41:23.326
I almost climbed in her kitchen window.

01:41:28.166 --> 01:41:31.168
What happened?
One minute, everything's fine.

01:41:31.335 --> 01:41:33.003
The next...

01:41:35.506 --> 01:41:37.340
What went wrong?

01:41:37.508 --> 01:41:40.260
Nothing went wrong. People change.

01:41:40.428 --> 01:41:41.678
People change?

01:41:41.846 --> 01:41:43.930
Yeah, people change.

01:41:45.349 --> 01:41:47.017
Can they change back?

01:41:50.688 --> 01:41:52.647
I don't know. I think it's harder.

01:41:56.778 --> 01:41:58.945
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:42:00.114 --> 01:42:03.033
Yeah. Not fair, you know?

01:42:03.201 --> 01:42:07.245
- You get used to one thing, and then...
- I know. It's not.

01:42:11.959 --> 01:42:14.169
Bud Parker, William Johnson...

01:42:14.337 --> 01:42:17.214
you are charged with the desecration
of a public building...

01:42:17.381 --> 01:42:19.549
and the use
of prohibited paint colors...

01:42:19.717 --> 01:42:22.219
in violation of
the Pleasantville code of conduct...

01:42:22.386 --> 01:42:24.179
and laws of common decency.

01:42:24.347 --> 01:42:26.389
Do you admit that on the night
of May 1 st...

01:42:26.557 --> 01:42:29.851
you did willfully apply the following
forbidden paint colors...

01:42:30.019 --> 01:42:32.854
to the north wall
of the Pleasantville police station:

01:42:33.231 --> 01:42:35.941
Red, pink, vermilion, puce, chartreuse...

01:42:36.108 --> 01:42:40.654
umber, blue, aqua, oxblood,
green, peach, crimson...

01:42:40.863 --> 01:42:43.448
yellow, olive, and magenta?

01:42:43.950 --> 01:42:46.660
Yeah, I do. Where's our lawyer?

01:42:48.037 --> 01:42:51.081
I think we wanna keep these proceedings
as pleasant as possible.

01:42:51.249 --> 01:42:53.250
I don't think a lawyer
will be necessary.

01:42:56.754 --> 01:42:59.589
Do you further admit
that this unnatural depiction...

01:42:59.757 --> 01:43:02.551
occurred in full public view
where it was accessible to...

01:43:02.718 --> 01:43:04.636
and in plain sight
of minor children?

01:43:05.888 --> 01:43:07.556
It was accessible to everyone.

01:43:07.723 --> 01:43:10.475
Let the record show
that the defendants have answered...

01:43:10.643 --> 01:43:13.270
in the affirmative to all charges.

01:43:14.230 --> 01:43:16.231
Do you have anything
to say in your defense?

01:43:16.399 --> 01:43:18.024
- Yeah, I do...
- Bill?

01:43:22.280 --> 01:43:25.240
I didn't mean to hurt anybody.

01:43:30.079 --> 01:43:33.540
Maybe if I painted
something different.

01:43:34.250 --> 01:43:36.459
Or maybe I could use
less colors or something.

01:43:36.627 --> 01:43:40.547
Or, you know, certain colors.
Or maybe I could...

01:43:41.132 --> 01:43:43.466
You could pick out
the colors beforehand...

01:43:43.634 --> 01:43:45.510
and then they wouldn't
bother anybody.

01:43:45.678 --> 01:43:48.471
- I've got something to say.
- Very well.

01:43:48.890 --> 01:43:50.557
You don't have a right to do this.

01:43:53.895 --> 01:43:55.353
I mean...

01:43:56.188 --> 01:43:59.357
I know you want it
to stay pleasant around here...

01:43:59.525 --> 01:44:03.612
but there are so many things...

01:44:03.779 --> 01:44:05.614
that are so much better.

01:44:05.781 --> 01:44:10.160
Like silly or sexy...

01:44:11.329 --> 01:44:14.915
or dangerous or brief.

01:44:16.042 --> 01:44:20.211
And every one of those things
is in you all the time...

01:44:20.379 --> 01:44:22.179
if you just have the guts
to look for them.

01:44:23.382 --> 01:44:25.842
- Enough.
- I thought I was allowed to defend myself.

01:44:26.010 --> 01:44:28.094
- You're not allowed to lie.
- I'm not lying.

01:44:28.262 --> 01:44:32.599
You see those faces up there?
They're no different than you are.

01:44:32.767 --> 01:44:34.887
They just happen to see something
inside themselves...

01:44:36.187 --> 01:44:38.855
- I said, that's enough.
- I'll show you. Dad?

01:44:39.982 --> 01:44:41.358
Yeah, Bud?

01:44:41.525 --> 01:44:45.070
It's okay, Dad. Just listen for a sec.

01:44:46.864 --> 01:44:48.490
I know you miss her.

01:44:48.699 --> 01:44:51.326
I mean, you told me you did.

01:44:51.494 --> 01:44:55.872
But maybe it's not just the cooking...

01:44:56.040 --> 01:44:58.792
or the cleaning that you miss.

01:44:58.960 --> 01:45:01.378
Maybe it's something else.

01:45:02.713 --> 01:45:06.341
Maybe you can't even describe it.

01:45:07.551 --> 01:45:10.387
Maybe you only know it
when it's gone.

01:45:12.014 --> 01:45:16.393
Maybe it's like there's a whole piece
of you that's missing too.

01:45:22.274 --> 01:45:24.401
Look at her, Dad.

01:45:28.155 --> 01:45:30.407
Doesn't she look pretty like that?

01:45:32.201 --> 01:45:36.413
Doesn't she look just as beautiful...

01:45:36.706 --> 01:45:39.207
as the first time you met her?

01:45:40.876 --> 01:45:44.004
You really want her back
the way she was?

01:45:53.222 --> 01:45:55.849
Doesn't she look wonderful?

01:45:59.812 --> 01:46:04.482
Now, don't you wish
you could tell her that?

01:46:16.328 --> 01:46:17.787
You're out of order.

01:46:17.997 --> 01:46:19.330
Why am I out of order?

01:46:19.498 --> 01:46:22.125
I'm not gonna let you turn
this courtroom into a circus.

01:46:22.293 --> 01:46:25.712
I don't think it's a circus,
and I don't think they do either.

01:46:27.798 --> 01:46:31.593
- This behavior must stop at once.
- But see? That's just the point.

01:46:31.761 --> 01:46:33.845
It can't stop at once,
because it's in you...

01:46:34.013 --> 01:46:36.473
and you can't stop something
that's inside you.

01:46:36.640 --> 01:46:37.807
It is not inside me.

01:46:37.975 --> 01:46:39.934
- Oh, sure, it is.
- No, it is not.

01:46:43.522 --> 01:46:45.815
What do you wanna do to me
right now?

01:46:45.983 --> 01:46:50.111
Come on. Everyone is turning colors.

01:46:50.279 --> 01:46:52.238
Kids are making out in the street.

01:46:52.865 --> 01:46:55.825
No one is getting their dinner.
Hell, you could have a flood.

01:46:55.993 --> 01:46:58.203
Pretty soon, the women
could be going to work...

01:46:58.370 --> 01:47:00.371
while the men stayed at home
and cooked.

01:47:00.539 --> 01:47:02.749
- That is not going to happen.
- But it could.

01:47:02.917 --> 01:47:04.751
No, it could not!

01:47:10.091 --> 01:47:11.508
Bud.

01:47:38.369 --> 01:47:40.787
Hey, look at this.

01:48:10.192 --> 01:48:11.568
Bud.

01:48:22.913 --> 01:48:24.122
Uch.

01:48:25.082 --> 01:48:28.042
- What an image.
- Oh, shut up.

01:48:28.210 --> 01:48:29.586
Bud.

01:49:19.011 --> 01:49:21.221
You sure you don't
wanna come home?

01:49:21.388 --> 01:49:24.182
Yeah. I gotta do this
for a little while.

01:49:24.642 --> 01:49:26.601
Besides, you think
I even have a chance...

01:49:26.769 --> 01:49:28.978
of getting into college back there?

01:49:29.146 --> 01:49:30.271
Honestly?

01:49:35.110 --> 01:49:37.946
- Do you have your admissions letter?
- Yeah. It's right here.

01:49:40.532 --> 01:49:42.951
I did the slut thing, David.

01:49:43.118 --> 01:49:44.786
Got kind of old.

01:49:46.914 --> 01:49:49.415
I'll come back
and check on you soon.

01:49:49.583 --> 01:49:50.917
Okay.

01:50:06.642 --> 01:50:09.018
You turned into a pretty cool guy.

01:50:09.186 --> 01:50:11.104
How'd that happen?

01:50:11.897 --> 01:50:12.939
I don't know.

01:50:15.693 --> 01:50:17.443
- I'll see you.
- Okay.

01:50:23.951 --> 01:50:25.451
Bye.

01:50:38.590 --> 01:50:40.508
Just don't forget about me.

01:50:41.552 --> 01:50:44.137
Even if you never come back.

01:50:44.430 --> 01:50:46.389
I just don't want you
to forget about me.

01:50:47.057 --> 01:50:48.975
I couldn't do that.

01:50:58.110 --> 01:51:01.279
- Here.
- Oh, what's this?

01:51:01.447 --> 01:51:03.948
Lots of stuff.
A meat loaf sandwich and...

01:51:04.116 --> 01:51:06.284
And a hard-boiled egg.

01:51:06.452 --> 01:51:08.703
And some marshmallow rice squares.

01:51:08.871 --> 01:51:10.747
Hello.

01:51:11.290 --> 01:51:14.834
There's some fried chicken in there too.

01:51:17.588 --> 01:51:20.173
Don't skip dinner just because
you're not here anymore.

01:51:20.341 --> 01:51:25.178
- I won't. I thought that you weren't gonna...
- Oh, I had to come say goodbye.

01:51:32.519 --> 01:51:35.480
Just wear this on the trip...

01:51:35.647 --> 01:51:38.024
in case it gets cold.

01:51:39.360 --> 01:51:40.902
It's a pretty short trip.

01:51:41.278 --> 01:51:42.945
Still.

01:51:46.283 --> 01:51:47.825
Oh, Bud.

01:51:54.333 --> 01:51:56.542
I am just so proud of you.

01:51:57.628 --> 01:51:59.212
Thanks.

01:52:02.341 --> 01:52:03.591
I know.

01:52:03.759 --> 01:52:05.468
I love you too.

01:52:15.187 --> 01:52:19.899
Well...

01:52:21.110 --> 01:52:23.903
I... I guess you'd better stand back.

01:53:18.542 --> 01:53:21.627
That concludes the first hour
of the Pleasantville marathon.

01:53:21.795 --> 01:53:24.881
Don't forget, we'll be going all night long
until noon tomorr...

01:54:01.793 --> 01:54:03.211
Hi.

01:54:04.254 --> 01:54:05.838
I thought you went out of town.

01:54:06.924 --> 01:54:08.424
Came back.

01:54:13.096 --> 01:54:14.555
What's wrong?

01:54:15.933 --> 01:54:18.100
I don't know.
Everything's just so fucked up.

01:54:19.186 --> 01:54:21.562
I got halfway there and thought,
"What am I doing?"

01:54:21.730 --> 01:54:23.523
He's nine years younger than I am.

01:54:23.690 --> 01:54:26.025
Doesn't make me feel younger.
Makes me feel older.

01:54:29.988 --> 01:54:33.115
When your father was here,
I used to think this was it.

01:54:33.325 --> 01:54:35.117
This is the way
it was always gonna be.

01:54:35.285 --> 01:54:38.955
I had the right house. I had the right car.
I had the right life.

01:54:39.122 --> 01:54:41.958
There is no right house.
There is no right car.

01:54:46.004 --> 01:54:47.964
God, my face must be a mess.

01:54:49.299 --> 01:54:50.633
It looks great.

01:54:50.801 --> 01:54:54.595
Honey, that's really sweet of you,
but I'm sure it does not look great.

01:54:54.763 --> 01:54:56.472
Sure, it does.

01:55:04.439 --> 01:55:05.606
Come here.

01:55:07.401 --> 01:55:10.152
I'm 40 years old.
I mean, it's not supposed to be like this.

01:55:10.320 --> 01:55:13.030
It's not supposed to be anything.

01:55:13.240 --> 01:55:14.365
Hold still.

01:55:18.704 --> 01:55:21.497
How'd you get so smart
all of a sudden?

01:55:24.501 --> 01:55:26.627
I had a good day.

01:56:04.750 --> 01:56:07.084
So, what's gonna happen now?

01:56:12.215 --> 01:56:13.883
I don't know.

01:56:14.801 --> 01:56:16.677
Do you know
what's going to happen now?

01:56:19.056 --> 01:56:21.515
No. I don't.

01:56:36.114 --> 01:56:37.907
I guess I don't either.
