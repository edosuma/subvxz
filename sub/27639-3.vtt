01:15.283 --> 01:17.285
[theme music playing]

01:35.596 --> 01:37.305
So, I'm at a grocery store

01:37.347 --> 01:39.140
and I need quarter

01:37.347 --> 01:39.140
for grocery cart...

01:39.182 --> 01:40.642
-...but--

01:39.182 --> 01:40.642
-The store's closed.

01:40.684 --> 01:43.395
No. Nothing in minivan ashtray.

01:43.437 --> 01:46.565
We always keep lots of quarter

01:43.437 --> 01:46.565
in the minivan ashtray.

01:46.607 --> 01:48.442
-So, you were robbed?

01:46.607 --> 01:48.442
-No.

01:48.483 --> 01:51.946
Someone take quarter

01:48.483 --> 01:51.946
from minivan ashtray

01:48.483 --> 01:51.946
and not refill.

01:51.987 --> 01:53.488
-Maybe it was someone

01:51.987 --> 01:53.488
from the car wash?

01:51.987 --> 01:53.488
-No.

01:53.530 --> 01:55.115
Do you have a hole

01:53.530 --> 01:55.115
in your car floor?

01:55.156 --> 01:56.742
Mrs. Kim take

01:55.156 --> 01:56.742
and not put back.

01:56.784 --> 01:59.286
We have a cash register

01:56.784 --> 01:59.286
full of quarters. Just take!

01:59.327 --> 02:00.412
Just remember to put back.

I'm just waiting for my change.

02:08.503 --> 02:09.880
Oh!

02:09.922 --> 02:12.507
There they are,

02:09.922 --> 02:12.507
the magnificent Kims.

02:12.549 --> 02:15.094
Hello, Mrs. Kim.

02:15.135 --> 02:17.054
Okay. Have to say hi

02:15.135 --> 02:17.054
to Mrs. Mehta.

02:17.096 --> 02:18.889
-Hey.

02:17.096 --> 02:18.889
-Hi, Mrs. Mehta.

02:18.931 --> 02:20.432
So, we're still on

02:18.931 --> 02:20.432
for next Monday.

02:20.474 --> 02:21.892
What Monday?

02:21.934 --> 02:24.185
-I tell you.

02:21.934 --> 02:24.185
-Dinner. All of us.

02:24.227 --> 02:26.229
-He never tell me

02:24.227 --> 02:26.229
anything.

02:24.227 --> 02:26.229
-No.

02:26.271 --> 02:27.731
She never tell me anything.

02:27.773 --> 02:29.441
Like other day,

02:27.773 --> 02:29.441
I am at grocery store

02:29.483 --> 02:31.318
and I need a quarter

02:29.483 --> 02:31.318
for grocery cart...

02:31.359 --> 02:34.362
Save it for Monday.

02:31.359 --> 02:34.362
We don't want to waste

02:31.359 --> 02:34.362
all our good stories.

02:34.404 --> 02:37.157
What if I already have a plan,

02:34.404 --> 02:37.157
or I don't want to go?

02:37.198 --> 02:40.201
Of course, I do want to go,

02:37.198 --> 02:40.201
but you know what I mean.

02:40.243 --> 02:41.996
Men is so forgetful.

02:42.037 --> 02:43.204
Oh, I don't know.

02:43.246 --> 02:45.457
Mr. Mehta's been

02:43.246 --> 02:45.457
very thoughtful lately.

02:45.499 --> 02:46.834
She's too kind.

02:46.875 --> 02:48.585
We merely started

02:46.875 --> 02:48.585
a joint calendar

02:48.627 --> 02:50.420
to catch each other up

02:48.627 --> 02:50.420
on our comings and goings.

02:50.462 --> 02:51.630
His idea.

02:51.672 --> 02:54.091
I must take credit

02:51.672 --> 02:54.091
where credit is given.

02:54.133 --> 02:56.175
And I must give it

02:54.133 --> 02:56.175
when it's due.

02:58.012 --> 02:59.763
[Mr. Mehta]

02:58.012 --> 02:59.763
The joys of scheduling.

02:59.805 --> 03:02.432
I suppose we should ultimately

02:59.805 --> 03:02.432
thank our couple's counsellor.

03:02.474 --> 03:04.726
Open communication,

03:02.474 --> 03:04.726
that's the key.

03:04.768 --> 03:05.978
You in therapy?

03:06.020 --> 03:07.395
We'll tell you all

03:06.020 --> 03:07.395
about it over dinner.

03:07.437 --> 03:09.439
Because if anyone

03:07.437 --> 03:09.439
could stand to benefit...

03:11.274 --> 03:12.609
It's everyone!

03:12.651 --> 03:13.861
See you Monday.

03:16.404 --> 03:17.447

03:17.489 --> 03:19.240
Pfft. Couples therapy. Huh.

03:19.282 --> 03:20.325

[indistinct chatter]

03:31.336 --> 03:33.254
Oh, my God.

03:31.336 --> 03:33.254
That's Rhonda Mills.

03:33.296 --> 03:34.882
If you owe her money,

03:33.296 --> 03:34.882
I can spot you.

03:34.923 --> 03:37.258
No. She's the editor of<i> Canvas.</i>

03:37.300 --> 03:39.136
<i>Canvas</i> is

03:37.300 --> 03:39.136
a photography magazine.

03:39.178 --> 03:41.722
They basically discovered

03:39.178 --> 03:41.722
Petra Collins.

03:41.763 --> 03:44.558
Oh. Is she the one

03:41.763 --> 03:44.558
who takes pictures

03:41.763 --> 03:44.558
of babies in pumpkins?

03:44.599 --> 03:46.852
-No.

03:44.599 --> 03:46.852
-This is so cool.

03:46.894 --> 03:49.104
-Hey, Rhonda.

03:46.894 --> 03:49.104
-What are you doing?

03:49.146 --> 03:52.232
This is Janet. She loves

03:49.146 --> 03:52.232
your photography pictures.

03:55.485 --> 03:57.404
Sorry.

03:57.445 --> 04:00.323
I'm a huge fan. And I know

03:57.445 --> 04:00.323
it's super lame to say,

04:00.365 --> 04:04.285
but your work inspired me

04:00.365 --> 04:04.285
to pursue this as a career.

04:04.327 --> 04:06.287
-You're a photographer?

04:04.327 --> 04:06.287
-Yes.

04:06.329 --> 04:08.999
Well, I'm studying it. So, no.

04:09.041 --> 04:10.500
I just lied. Arrest me.

04:10.542 --> 04:11.793
-But don't.

04:10.542 --> 04:11.793
-[chuckles]

04:11.835 --> 04:13.712
It's okay. What's your name?

04:13.754 --> 04:16.256
-Janet.

04:13.754 --> 04:16.256
-Well, it's very nice

04:13.754 --> 04:16.256
to meet you, Janet.

04:16.840 --> 04:18.217
You too.

04:18.258 --> 04:20.594
And is there any chance

04:18.258 --> 04:20.594
I could get your card?

04:20.635 --> 04:22.721
Just to ask a couple questions

04:20.635 --> 04:22.721
or advice sometime.

04:22.763 --> 04:23.889
Um...

04:23.931 --> 04:25.390
I don't think I have any on me.

04:26.474 --> 04:28.309
I could give you my email.

04:28.351 --> 04:31.105
It's a little funny,

04:28.351 --> 04:31.105
so it's easier if I type it.

04:31.146 --> 04:33.232
Wow. Thank you.

04:34.691 --> 04:36.944
And I promise I won't send

04:34.691 --> 04:36.944
anything weird.

04:37.903 --> 04:40.072
Just regular emails from me.

04:41.615 --> 04:43.491
Thank you, Rhonda.

04:43.533 --> 04:45.119
-I'm Janet, by the way.

04:43.533 --> 04:45.119
-Great.

04:48.914 --> 04:51.332
I'm just saying, I think

04:48.914 --> 04:51.332
I've worn my chill pants

04:48.914 --> 04:51.332
long enough.

04:51.374 --> 04:53.627
[Alejandro] I get it.

04:51.374 --> 04:53.627
But you know I have

04:51.374 --> 04:53.627
been crazy busy lately.

04:53.668 --> 04:55.129
[Shannon] I don't even

04:53.668 --> 04:55.129
like my bossy pants.

04:55.170 --> 04:56.296
But I'm willing

04:55.170 --> 04:56.296
to put them on.

04:56.337 --> 04:57.714
[sighs]

04:59.382 --> 05:00.759
Cheese string, right?

05:02.719 --> 05:05.346
[Alejandro] Look, I promise

05:02.719 --> 05:05.346
I will get to it as soon

05:02.719 --> 05:05.346
as possible.

05:05.388 --> 05:07.141
[whispers] Hey.

05:05.388 --> 05:07.141
What's going on?

05:07.182 --> 05:08.976
Oh. I work better in bare feet.

05:09.017 --> 05:12.271
-No! Shannon and buddy.

05:09.017 --> 05:12.271
-I don't know.

05:12.312 --> 05:13.981
Do your feet ever swell up

05:12.312 --> 05:13.981
after lunch?

05:14.022 --> 05:16.399
-[Alejandro] I don't know.

05:14.022 --> 05:16.399
I mean--

05:14.022 --> 05:16.399
-Me or Jung, take your pick.

05:16.441 --> 05:18.318
Do you think she's

05:16.441 --> 05:18.318
telling him about our kiss?

05:18.359 --> 05:19.569
When did we kiss?

05:19.611 --> 05:20.904
When I kissed Shannon.

05:20.946 --> 05:23.031
Why would she tell him that?

05:23.073 --> 05:25.117
My feet are like balloons.

05:25.159 --> 05:27.786
Hey, guys! Sorry to interrupt,

05:25.159 --> 05:27.786
but Jung, Alejandro's got

05:25.159 --> 05:27.786
a hutch to move with you.

05:27.828 --> 05:29.579
-Sorry?

05:27.828 --> 05:29.579
-It's a figure of speech.

05:29.621 --> 05:31.790
It's not. I just have a hutch.

05:31.832 --> 05:33.792
-About what?

05:31.832 --> 05:33.792
-Oh, not a hunch.

05:33.834 --> 05:35.460
A hutch. That he needs

05:33.834 --> 05:35.460
your help moving.

05:35.502 --> 05:37.504
Yeah. It's in storage.

05:35.502 --> 05:37.504
You up for it?

05:37.545 --> 05:39.338
Sure, we'd be glad to help.

05:39.380 --> 05:41.967
Actually, I need you

05:39.380 --> 05:41.967
to help me close up here.

05:42.009 --> 05:43.342
Because he's stronger.

05:43.969 --> 05:45.344
And has shoes on.

05:50.684 --> 05:52.519
Hey. Got some

05:50.684 --> 05:52.519
jube-jubes from work.

05:52.560 --> 05:53.812
Oh, yummy.

05:55.480 --> 05:56.815
Why are they in one big ball?

05:56.857 --> 05:58.357
Uh, they're month-olds.

05:58.399 --> 06:00.735
Probably why I got 'em for free.

06:00.777 --> 06:02.279
Guess who we saw

06:00.777 --> 06:02.279
at the coffee shop?

06:03.030 --> 06:04.865
-Uh...

06:03.030 --> 06:04.865
-Petra Collins!

06:04.906 --> 06:06.491
-Rhonda Mills.

06:04.906 --> 06:06.491
-[Gerald] Seriously?

06:06.533 --> 06:08.869
Man! The one time

06:06.533 --> 06:08.869
I don't go for coffee.

06:08.910 --> 06:11.288
And Janet got her email.

06:11.330 --> 06:13.414
-No way!

06:11.330 --> 06:13.414
-Mmm-hmm.

06:13.456 --> 06:14.708
Congratulations.

06:14.749 --> 06:17.169
I bet she could seriously

06:14.749 --> 06:17.169
open some doors for you.

06:17.211 --> 06:18.586
Hopefully. Who knows?

06:18.628 --> 06:21.173
You should reach out too, babe.

06:21.215 --> 06:22.799
I don't know. It might be

06:21.215 --> 06:22.799
kind of weird.

06:22.841 --> 06:25.052
Just reach out.

06:25.093 --> 06:27.386
Well, I mean, if you think...

06:28.889 --> 06:31.141
Of course! I'm easy.

06:31.183 --> 06:34.061
Easy breezy lemon squeezy!

06:34.102 --> 06:37.522
-Cool.

06:34.102 --> 06:37.522
-I will give you her email as

06:34.102 --> 06:37.522
soon as my phone's charged.

06:38.315 --> 06:40.399
Gotta plug it in.

06:40.441 --> 06:42.694
-I thought you charged

06:40.441 --> 06:42.694
your phone at the coffee shop?

06:40.441 --> 06:42.694
-Bye.

06:50.869 --> 06:54.664
Keeping it here at, uh,

06:50.869 --> 06:54.664
at my buddy's is just,

06:50.869 --> 06:54.664
uh, cheaper than storage.

06:54.706 --> 06:55.707
Sure.

06:57.125 --> 06:59.086
So, this buddy of yours...

06:59.127 --> 07:00.379
Grab an end, dude.

07:01.296 --> 07:02.964
-The hutch.

07:01.296 --> 07:02.964
-[clears throat]

07:03.506 --> 07:04.966
Yep, okay.

07:06.176 --> 07:07.802
Hi.

07:07.844 --> 07:09.470
-What're you doing here?

07:07.844 --> 07:09.470
-Um...

07:10.264 --> 07:11.306
Oh, I live here.

07:12.515 --> 07:13.808
What are you doing here?

07:13.850 --> 07:16.686
Uh, you said I could come by

07:13.850 --> 07:16.686
while you were at Pilates.

07:16.728 --> 07:18.813
You said you loved me, so,

07:18.855 --> 07:20.899
I guess we were both wrong.

07:20.941 --> 07:22.109
Uh, maybe I should

07:20.941 --> 07:22.109
give you guys...

07:22.150 --> 07:24.111
So, is this for

07:22.150 --> 07:24.111
your new girlfriend?

07:24.152 --> 07:26.071
Shanae-nae, Shaniqua,

07:26.113 --> 07:28.448
Shep, whatever her dumb name is.

07:28.489 --> 07:29.783
Emily, please.

07:29.824 --> 07:31.159
Are you upset by that?

07:31.201 --> 07:33.954
-Oh, boy.

07:31.201 --> 07:33.954
-We used to share

07:31.201 --> 07:33.954
a Netflix account!

07:33.995 --> 07:35.455
I thought I knew you!

07:36.164 --> 07:37.457
Em.

07:38.541 --> 07:39.793
[Alejandro] Ow!

07:41.878 --> 07:43.504
Sorry, this won't take long.

07:43.546 --> 07:45.090
Emily! Watch the hutch.

07:46.383 --> 07:47.508
[door slams shut]

07:47.550 --> 07:49.261
[muffled talking]

07:55.809 --> 07:57.727
[talking stops]

08:00.147 --> 08:02.983
So I just straight up

08:00.147 --> 08:02.983
asked her for her email.

08:03.024 --> 08:05.402
I think she could sense

08:03.024 --> 08:05.402
my passion, my potential.

08:05.444 --> 08:07.487
So, she give you

08:05.444 --> 08:07.487
photography job?

08:07.528 --> 08:08.696
-That's not how it works.

08:07.528 --> 08:08.696
-Hmm.

08:08.738 --> 08:10.490
So, she can't give you job?

08:10.531 --> 08:12.867
She can, but I can't

08:10.531 --> 08:12.867
just ask her

08:10.531 --> 08:12.867
and risk the relationship.

08:12.909 --> 08:15.536
Oh, who cares about relationship

08:12.909 --> 08:15.536
if you don't get job?

08:15.578 --> 08:17.289
I'm playing the long game.

08:17.331 --> 08:19.333
And, if I give Gerald her email,

08:19.374 --> 08:21.168
he could make the game

08:19.374 --> 08:21.168
a lot longer, you know?

08:21.209 --> 08:23.795
Yeah. Because you

08:21.209 --> 08:23.795
wouldn't want someone

08:23.837 --> 08:26.547
to make a plan with someone else

08:23.837 --> 08:26.547
that he not tell you about.

08:26.589 --> 08:29.592
Yeah! I do know.

08:26.589 --> 08:29.592
Because I listening.

08:29.634 --> 08:33.680
But maybe Gerald

08:29.634 --> 08:33.680
tell Janet many time

08:29.634 --> 08:33.680
and she just forget.

08:33.721 --> 08:35.556
Or worse, she not listening.

08:35.598 --> 08:37.892
Point is, I did all the work.

08:37.934 --> 08:39.686
What work? You just walk

08:37.934 --> 08:39.686
into coffee shop.

08:39.727 --> 08:41.313
Yeah. And not get job.

08:41.355 --> 08:43.106
I initiated a conversation.

08:43.148 --> 08:44.524
That's not easy

08:43.148 --> 08:44.524
for an introvert.

08:44.565 --> 08:46.151
[scoffs] You is not introvert.

08:46.193 --> 08:50.405
Introvert is quiet

08:46.193 --> 08:50.405
and, uh, respectful.

08:46.193 --> 08:50.405
And, uh, like to mop.

08:50.447 --> 08:51.572
And, uh, clean bathroom.

08:51.614 --> 08:53.574
-Okay.

08:51.614 --> 08:53.574
-[bell rings]

08:53.616 --> 08:55.035
So... So, what do I tell Gerald?

08:55.076 --> 08:57.578
Uh, give him fake email.

08:57.620 --> 08:59.539
-Just lie?

08:57.620 --> 08:59.539
-No, not a lie.

08:59.580 --> 09:01.124
Maybe you make a mistake,

09:01.166 --> 09:02.583
on-purpose mistake.

09:02.625 --> 09:04.419
So, a lie.

09:04.461 --> 09:06.880
-Hello.

09:04.461 --> 09:06.880
-Oh! Pastor Nina.

09:06.921 --> 09:08.548
We just talking

09:06.921 --> 09:08.548
about the Jesus.

09:09.590 --> 09:11.051
That's great.

09:11.092 --> 09:14.012
I mean, I'm kind of

09:11.092 --> 09:14.012
off the clock right now,

09:11.092 --> 09:14.012
but, still,

09:14.054 --> 09:15.430
great.

09:19.809 --> 09:20.935
[exhales]

09:22.645 --> 09:23.604
-Hey!

09:22.645 --> 09:23.604
-Hey.

09:23.646 --> 09:25.065
Uh, everything okay?

09:25.106 --> 09:28.193
Uh, yeah, yeah.

09:25.106 --> 09:28.193
But, uh,

09:25.106 --> 09:28.193
here's an idea,

09:28.235 --> 09:30.362
let's, uh, keep this between

09:28.235 --> 09:30.362
me and you.

09:30.404 --> 09:32.155
You know, bro code?

09:32.197 --> 09:33.614
-Sure.

09:32.197 --> 09:33.614
-Thanks, man.

09:33.656 --> 09:36.034
You know women, they can read

09:33.656 --> 09:36.034
into things sometimes.

09:36.868 --> 09:38.619
All right. Leaving.

09:38.661 --> 09:39.620
[Emily] 'Kay. See ya.

09:40.830 --> 09:41.998
On three?

09:42.665 --> 09:44.292
One, two...

09:46.420 --> 09:47.628
[exhales deeply]

09:48.671 --> 09:50.507
Yeah. Finally, huh?

09:51.799 --> 09:53.801
[humming]

09:57.389 --> 09:58.432
Yobo!

09:58.473 --> 09:59.640
Tomorrow have to remember to--

09:59.682 --> 10:00.683
Hello.

10:01.560 --> 10:02.643
Pastor Nina.

10:02.685 --> 10:04.645
What you doing here so... late?

10:04.687 --> 10:06.647
I invite her for tea.

10:06.689 --> 10:08.149
[gasps] Where's you pants?

10:08.191 --> 10:09.734
[whispers] In the bedroom.

10:08.191 --> 10:09.734
I not know she's here.

10:09.776 --> 10:11.986
-If this is a bad time...

10:09.776 --> 10:11.986
-Oh, no. No.

10:12.028 --> 10:13.321
Be right back.

10:13.363 --> 10:14.864
In meantime,

10:14.906 --> 10:16.032
look over there.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.120
So, Pastor Nina,

10:21.580 --> 10:23.415
we have advice question for you.

10:23.831 --> 10:25.292
Oh. Sure.

10:25.333 --> 10:28.669
Other day, our friend

10:25.333 --> 10:28.669
get invitation from other friend

10:28.711 --> 10:31.798
to have dinner

10:28.711 --> 10:31.798
with together with them,

10:28.711 --> 10:31.798
but he don't tell his wife!

10:31.839 --> 10:33.800
[Appa] That's a boring story!

10:33.841 --> 10:37.678
He think his wife is never busy

10:33.841 --> 10:37.678
and he make plan

10:33.841 --> 10:37.678
without telling her.

10:37.720 --> 10:39.180
That's very bad, right?

10:39.222 --> 10:41.682
Well, it's hard to say.

10:39.222 --> 10:41.682
He may have just forgot.

10:41.724 --> 10:44.060
Yeah. Exactly.

10:41.724 --> 10:44.060
Listen to Pastor Nina.

10:44.102 --> 10:46.687
He always forgets

10:44.102 --> 10:46.687
because he don't think

10:44.102 --> 10:46.687
about other people.

10:46.729 --> 10:47.730
Who is this about?

10:47.772 --> 10:49.274
-I know what you doing.

10:47.772 --> 10:49.274
-I don't.

10:49.316 --> 10:50.442
Sneak attack.

10:50.484 --> 10:51.692
No, we just having tea.

10:51.734 --> 10:53.027
[Appa] I don't see any tea.

10:53.069 --> 10:55.822
Only trap for me

10:53.069 --> 10:55.822
with marriage counsellor Nina.

10:55.863 --> 10:57.198
This wasn't my idea.

10:57.240 --> 10:59.700
But, if you're interested

10:57.240 --> 10:59.700
in couples' therapy,

10:59.742 --> 11:00.868
you could always

10:59.742 --> 11:00.868
book an appointment.

11:00.910 --> 11:02.703
Yeah. Book appointment.

11:02.745 --> 11:03.704
No more sneak attack.

11:03.746 --> 11:05.039
How's Thursday at 10:00 a.m.?

11:05.081 --> 11:06.916
Okay, good.

11:05.081 --> 11:06.916
We both be there then.

11:06.958 --> 11:08.709
Wait, what?

11:08.751 --> 11:11.045
And whatever your issues are,

11:08.751 --> 11:11.045
I know you could work them out.

11:11.796 --> 11:13.214
With a lot of my help.

11:14.508 --> 11:15.509
Yeah.

11:22.765 --> 11:23.891
So, you're saying they had sex?

11:23.933 --> 11:25.644
I don't know.

11:23.933 --> 11:25.644
I was in the next room.

11:25.684 --> 11:27.728
When you bring a girl

11:25.684 --> 11:27.728
into your room

11:25.684 --> 11:27.728
and it goes quiet,

11:27.770 --> 11:29.772
I always know what's going on.

11:29.814 --> 11:32.733
-No, you don't.

11:29.814 --> 11:32.733
-If it goes quiet right away,

11:29.814 --> 11:32.733
that means one thing.

11:32.775 --> 11:35.736
But if there's talking

11:32.775 --> 11:35.736
and laughing,

11:32.775 --> 11:35.736
that means something else.

11:35.778 --> 11:38.156
If you're singing,

11:35.778 --> 11:38.156
then nothing's happening.

11:38.198 --> 11:39.740
Not necessarily.

11:39.782 --> 11:41.493
They definitely did it.

11:41.535 --> 11:42.910
But he knows

11:41.535 --> 11:42.910
I work with Shannon.

11:42.952 --> 11:44.954
That's why he invoked

11:42.952 --> 11:44.954
the bro code.

11:44.996 --> 11:47.123
But you gotta be

11:44.996 --> 11:47.123
the good bad friend.

11:47.165 --> 11:50.544
The guy who tells good friends

11:47.165 --> 11:50.544
bad things they need to hear.

11:52.462 --> 11:54.755
You know, sometimes girls

11:52.462 --> 11:54.755
ask me to sing.

11:54.797 --> 11:55.965
Doesn't make it right.

11:59.469 --> 12:00.761
There you go. Thanks.

12:00.803 --> 12:04.391
Hey, I owe you a huge thanks

12:00.803 --> 12:04.391
for Rhonda's deets.

12:05.016 --> 12:07.768
Uh, no thanks necessary.

12:07.810 --> 12:09.604
Do you even think

12:07.810 --> 12:09.604
you'll reach out?

12:09.646 --> 12:11.565
Does anyone really

12:09.646 --> 12:11.565
email anymore?

12:11.606 --> 12:13.316
Well, this guy does.

12:13.358 --> 12:14.568
It's done and done.

12:14.942 --> 12:16.570
Wow! Okay.

12:16.611 --> 12:18.821
Yeah. She responded,

12:16.611 --> 12:18.821
like, right away.

12:18.863 --> 12:20.323
She's super cool.

12:20.365 --> 12:22.033
And... And helpful.

12:22.075 --> 12:24.411
But, I mean, you already

12:22.075 --> 12:24.411
know that, obviously.

12:24.452 --> 12:26.162
Obviously, I do know that.

12:26.829 --> 12:28.623
But tell me more.

12:28.665 --> 12:30.584
Well, there's definitely

12:28.665 --> 12:30.584
a connection.

12:30.625 --> 12:33.378
Though I've learned a lot more

12:30.625 --> 12:33.378
about beekeeping

12:30.625 --> 12:33.378
than photography.

12:33.420 --> 12:34.795
But everyone's

12:33.420 --> 12:34.795
got a hobby, right?

12:34.837 --> 12:37.131
Well, probably not good

12:34.837 --> 12:37.131
to generalize.

12:37.173 --> 12:39.217
I think she's kind of lonely.

12:39.259 --> 12:41.469
So maybe just leave her

12:39.259 --> 12:41.469
to enjoy her solitude.

12:41.511 --> 12:42.803
She wants to meet in person.

12:42.845 --> 12:44.431
Like, soon.

12:44.472 --> 12:46.558
Did you tell her

12:44.472 --> 12:46.558
you're in a relationship?

12:46.600 --> 12:48.476
Maybe it's best

12:46.600 --> 12:48.476
to shut this down now.

12:48.518 --> 12:49.810
But she's so keen.

12:49.852 --> 12:53.814
She has this thing

12:49.852 --> 12:53.814
for unusual meeting places.

12:53.856 --> 12:55.609
Have you ever been to

12:53.856 --> 12:55.609
the underpass by the airport?

12:55.650 --> 12:56.817
I don't think you should

12:55.650 --> 12:56.817
meet her there.

12:56.859 --> 12:59.613
It's fine. It's not like

12:56.859 --> 12:59.613
she's going to murder me.

12:59.654 --> 13:00.697
She's a creative.

13:02.949 --> 13:04.367
[Umma] Yobo...

13:04.409 --> 13:05.826
Thank you for coming.

13:05.868 --> 13:08.037
Only reason I here

13:05.868 --> 13:08.037
is to prove you is wrong.

13:08.079 --> 13:09.330
Yeah. Me too.

13:09.372 --> 13:11.416
Oh, I'm so glad you made it.

13:11.458 --> 13:13.334
Would you mind helping me

13:11.458 --> 13:13.334
set up some chairs?

13:13.376 --> 13:14.835
Uh,

13:14.877 --> 13:16.421
we doing here?

13:16.463 --> 13:18.715
But we will need more chairs

13:16.463 --> 13:18.715
for the others.

13:18.757 --> 13:19.882
Other people is coming?

13:19.924 --> 13:22.427
Group therapy is very effective.

13:22.469 --> 13:24.387
You'll see that

13:22.469 --> 13:24.387
you're not alone.

13:24.429 --> 13:25.639
Oh! And there are the Hallers.

13:25.680 --> 13:28.891
Welcome, Linda, Bill.

13:25.680 --> 13:28.891
These are the Kims.

13:28.933 --> 13:32.562
[Pastor Nina] Oh! And hello.

13:28.933 --> 13:32.562
Rose and Simon Aquino.

13:32.604 --> 13:33.854
-[Simon] Hello.

13:32.604 --> 13:33.854
-[Pastor Nina] Oh, hi!

13:33.896 --> 13:35.273
And are you new?

13:35.315 --> 13:37.484
Normally we don't do

13:35.315 --> 13:37.484
walk-ins, but,

13:37.525 --> 13:39.653
oh, what the heck. Go on in.

13:39.694 --> 13:40.819
Pastor Nina doing sneak attack.

13:40.861 --> 13:42.863
Yeah, yeah. I know

13:40.861 --> 13:42.863
what sneak attack is.

13:42.905 --> 13:44.282
I'll get more chairs.

13:45.908 --> 13:47.786
-[cell phone vibrates]

13:45.908 --> 13:47.786
-It's her again.

13:47.826 --> 13:49.870
-Okay, listen, Gerald--

13:47.826 --> 13:49.870
-She wants to meet tonight.

13:49.912 --> 13:52.248
"Wear loose clothing."

13:52.290 --> 13:55.293
-I will.

13:52.290 --> 13:55.293
-Look, Gerald, it's obviously

13:52.290 --> 13:55.293
not Rhonda Mills.

13:55.335 --> 13:57.378
Trust me, her name's

13:55.335 --> 13:57.378
all over the honey jar labels.

13:58.421 --> 14:00.881
I gave you a fake email address.

14:00.923 --> 14:03.426
-What?

14:00.923 --> 14:03.426
-You're talking to

14:00.923 --> 14:03.426
some other Rhonda Mills.

14:05.136 --> 14:07.639
Okay, um...

14:07.681 --> 14:11.267
But all the... The...

14:07.681 --> 14:11.267
The back-and-forths.

14:07.681 --> 14:11.267
And the cheerful anecdotes.

14:11.309 --> 14:13.894
Wait, why would you give me

14:11.309 --> 14:13.894
a fake email address?

14:13.936 --> 14:16.105
I know, it's bad,

14:16.147 --> 14:17.898
but I'm just such a fan

14:16.147 --> 14:17.898
of her career...

14:17.940 --> 14:19.900
Well, which one?

14:17.940 --> 14:19.900
Photography or bee-keeping?

14:19.942 --> 14:21.068
-She's not a bee-keeper.

14:19.942 --> 14:21.068
-Right.

14:21.110 --> 14:22.903
Sorry. I'm still

14:21.110 --> 14:22.903
processing all this.

14:22.945 --> 14:26.658
I just wanted to cultivate

14:22.945 --> 14:26.658
a mentor-mentee relationship.

14:26.700 --> 14:28.117
And I know you do too,

14:28.159 --> 14:29.869
but I hadn't even

14:28.159 --> 14:29.869
emailed her yet.

14:30.662 --> 14:32.246
Sorry.

14:32.288 --> 14:33.707
Just let me write her first.

14:33.748 --> 14:35.333
Then I can ask if it's okay

14:33.748 --> 14:35.333
to give you her email.

14:36.668 --> 14:37.711
Okay.

14:37.752 --> 14:39.920
Uh, sounds good.

14:39.962 --> 14:42.882
I've actually been

14:39.962 --> 14:42.882
sitting on this email for days.

14:42.923 --> 14:45.218
I was too nervous to send it.

14:45.259 --> 14:46.761
-[cell phone chimes]

14:45.259 --> 14:46.761
-There.

14:46.803 --> 14:49.764
Okay, well, let me know

14:46.803 --> 14:49.764
what she says.

14:49.806 --> 14:50.807
[cell phone chimes]

14:52.600 --> 14:54.728
It... It bounced back.

14:54.769 --> 14:56.896
-That's weird.

14:54.769 --> 14:56.896
-But that's the email

14:54.769 --> 14:56.896
she gave me.

14:58.898 --> 15:00.900
Maybe you two have

14:58.898 --> 15:00.900
more in common

14:58.898 --> 15:00.900
than you think.

15:04.904 --> 15:05.905
[Appa sighs]

15:07.114 --> 15:08.575
[clears throat]

15:08.616 --> 15:10.201
Okay, maybe we start.

15:10.243 --> 15:12.119
You. What's you problem? Go.

15:12.161 --> 15:13.538
Sorry?

15:13.580 --> 15:15.248
I think we should

15:13.580 --> 15:15.248
probably wait for--

15:15.289 --> 15:17.542
Well, we were

15:15.289 --> 15:17.542
at a restaurant

15:15.289 --> 15:17.542
with friends

15:17.584 --> 15:19.335
and he shushed me

15:17.584 --> 15:19.335
in front of everyone.

15:19.377 --> 15:21.254
-Shh.

15:19.377 --> 15:21.254
-Stop it!

15:21.295 --> 15:22.797
We just got back from Florida

15:22.839 --> 15:25.466
and I was telling our friends

15:22.839 --> 15:25.466
that we saw a manatee--

15:25.508 --> 15:27.051
Okay. We vote now.

15:27.093 --> 15:28.845
Everyone in favor

15:27.093 --> 15:28.845
of Mr. Haller.

15:31.431 --> 15:32.515
What's going on?

15:32.557 --> 15:34.308
I also vote

15:32.557 --> 15:34.308
with Mr. Haller.

15:34.350 --> 15:36.060
Oh, we're not voting.

15:36.102 --> 15:37.395
Then how we know who wins?

15:37.437 --> 15:40.022
This isn't about winning.

15:37.437 --> 15:40.022
This is a safe space.

15:40.064 --> 15:41.190
-I feel safe voting.

15:40.064 --> 15:41.190
-[Appa] Yeah.

15:41.232 --> 15:43.276
And more clear,

15:41.232 --> 15:43.276
winner-loser style.

15:43.317 --> 15:46.696
No one wins unless

15:43.317 --> 15:46.696
we communicate,

15:43.317 --> 15:46.696
respectfully.

15:46.738 --> 15:49.616
We saw a shark once

15:46.738 --> 15:49.616
when we were in Bermuda.

15:49.657 --> 15:51.826
Let's see if we can try

15:49.657 --> 15:51.826
role playing

15:51.868 --> 15:53.578
to better understand

15:51.868 --> 15:53.578
each other's point of view.

15:53.620 --> 15:54.829
Can I go?

15:54.871 --> 15:57.206
Sure. Again, the idea here

15:54.871 --> 15:57.206
is to empathize--

15:57.248 --> 15:58.999
[impersonating Appa]

15:57.248 --> 15:58.999
Hi, I'm Mr. Kim.

15:59.041 --> 16:01.001
I don't like to

15:59.041 --> 16:01.001
talk about my feeling.

16:01.043 --> 16:02.169
I not talk like that.

16:02.211 --> 16:04.004
I like to control everything.

16:04.046 --> 16:05.298
Okay, see you.

16:05.339 --> 16:07.592
-I wanna go next.

16:05.339 --> 16:07.592
-Sure, again,

16:05.339 --> 16:07.592
but the point is--

16:07.634 --> 16:11.178
[dopey voice] My name is Simon

16:07.634 --> 16:11.178
and I promoted my assistant

16:07.634 --> 16:11.178
so one day she'll sleep with me.

16:11.220 --> 16:12.764
-That's not why I did it.

16:11.220 --> 16:12.764
-Okay.

16:12.806 --> 16:14.014
-We're going to pause there.

16:12.806 --> 16:14.014
-[mockingly] Hi.

16:14.056 --> 16:16.058
-We going to pause there.

16:14.056 --> 16:16.058
-No dopey voices!

16:27.821 --> 16:30.114
-Hey, Junion rings.

16:27.821 --> 16:30.114
-Hey, new one.

16:30.156 --> 16:32.199
Oh, they come to me

16:30.156 --> 16:32.199
when I'm photocopying.

16:32.241 --> 16:33.493
Shannana split.

16:33.534 --> 16:35.954
Spicy tuna Alejand-roll.

16:35.995 --> 16:37.622
-Anyway, what's up?

16:35.995 --> 16:37.622
-Just checking in.

16:37.664 --> 16:40.040
You know, wanted to see

16:37.664 --> 16:40.040
how that new hutch

16:37.664 --> 16:40.040
was working out for you.

16:40.082 --> 16:42.794
Aww. Well, my plates

16:40.082 --> 16:42.794
say "Thank you."

16:42.836 --> 16:44.796
Yeah, hanging out with Alejandro

16:44.838 --> 16:46.380
is always interesting.

16:47.256 --> 16:48.633
He really likes you too.

16:51.636 --> 16:54.054
-Anything else?

16:51.636 --> 16:54.054
-No.

16:54.096 --> 16:57.057
Well, maybe. Actually,

16:54.096 --> 16:57.057
I could use your advice

16:54.096 --> 16:57.057
on something.

16:57.099 --> 17:00.478
See, I have this friend.

16:57.099 --> 17:00.478
And she... He

17:00.520 --> 17:02.396
thinks he is in

17:00.520 --> 17:02.396
a committed relationship.

17:02.438 --> 17:04.440
Only he might not be.

17:04.482 --> 17:05.650
But he doesn't know that.

17:05.692 --> 17:07.902
Ooh, juicy.

17:05.692 --> 17:07.902
And slightly confusing.

17:07.944 --> 17:12.490
I feel terrible

17:07.944 --> 17:12.490
not saying anything,

17:07.944 --> 17:12.490
but it's not my place.

17:12.532 --> 17:14.659
-Okay...

17:12.532 --> 17:14.659
-On the other hand,

17:12.532 --> 17:14.659
if it was me,

17:14.701 --> 17:16.285
I would want to know.

17:16.327 --> 17:18.037
I mean if you can't

17:16.327 --> 17:18.037
be honest with someone,

17:18.078 --> 17:19.330
what kind of relationship

17:18.078 --> 17:19.330
are you in?

17:19.372 --> 17:20.748
Hey, Bro.

17:20.790 --> 17:23.042
-Hey. Ready for lunch?

17:20.790 --> 17:23.042
-Yeah.

17:24.919 --> 17:26.337
We were just talking and...

17:27.296 --> 17:29.089
-I kissed Jung.

17:27.296 --> 17:29.089
-What?

17:29.131 --> 17:31.843
-Whoa.

17:29.131 --> 17:31.843
-You're right. It feels better

17:29.131 --> 17:31.843
to get that out in the open.

17:32.510 --> 17:34.220
You kissed him?

17:34.261 --> 17:35.680
I'm sorry, it was months ago.

17:35.722 --> 17:38.057
I didn't tell you because

17:35.722 --> 17:38.057
it didn't mean anything.

17:38.098 --> 17:39.099
How could you?

17:39.141 --> 17:40.852
Easy, bro.

17:39.141 --> 17:40.852
You're not exactly

17:39.141 --> 17:40.852
guilt-free--

17:40.894 --> 17:42.854
I don't think you should be

17:40.894 --> 17:42.854
saying anything right now, bro.

17:44.438 --> 17:45.565
The hutch was

17:44.438 --> 17:45.565
at Emily's apartment.

17:47.025 --> 17:49.903
-Oh, my God.

17:47.025 --> 17:49.903
Are you still seeing her?

17:47.025 --> 17:49.903
-Dude!

17:49.944 --> 17:52.030
-Bro code!

17:49.944 --> 17:52.030
-Like I want that hutch now.

17:52.071 --> 17:55.115
It's probably all gross

17:52.071 --> 17:55.115
with her dumb sweaters

17:52.071 --> 17:55.115
and mismatched forks.

17:55.157 --> 17:56.325
Hey, can we not

17:55.157 --> 17:56.325
talk about this here?

17:56.367 --> 17:57.744
Fine. We can talk

17:56.367 --> 17:57.744
about it in here.

17:57.785 --> 17:59.996
But we are going

17:57.785 --> 17:59.996
to talk about it.

18:00.038 --> 18:03.499
[Alejandro] I just didn't want

18:00.038 --> 18:03.499
you to know because I knew

18:00.038 --> 18:03.499
that you wouldn't take it well.

18:03.541 --> 18:04.959
[Shannon] Like...

18:05.543 --> 18:09.255
[muffled talking]

18:09.296 --> 18:11.090
[talking stops]

18:13.175 --> 18:17.764
So, what we'll try right now

18:13.175 --> 18:17.764
is called "Five Minutes

18:13.175 --> 18:17.764
of Soft Eye Contact."

18:17.805 --> 18:20.140
-What?

18:17.805 --> 18:20.140
-Put yourself at eye-level

18:17.805 --> 18:20.140
with your partner

18:20.182 --> 18:22.309
and then gaze softly at them.

18:23.352 --> 18:24.520
[both exhale]

18:32.612 --> 18:33.988
Okay, we stop now.

18:34.030 --> 18:36.323
Eye contact is dangerous.

18:34.030 --> 18:36.323
Make everybody scare.

18:36.365 --> 18:37.784
It's a powerful communication--

18:37.825 --> 18:40.244
We communicate enough today.

18:40.286 --> 18:43.081
Maybe everyone think it's okay

18:40.286 --> 18:43.081
to talk about

18:40.286 --> 18:43.081
they-they problem...

18:43.122 --> 18:45.041
Or they daddy

18:43.122 --> 18:45.041
was always so busy,

18:45.083 --> 18:49.128
they never have time to listen

18:45.083 --> 18:49.128
or say "I care for you"

18:45.083 --> 18:49.128
or that they love...

18:50.212 --> 18:51.171
Yobo...

18:52.381 --> 18:54.467
Yeah. Everything fine.

18:54.508 --> 18:57.177
But I think it's a waste of time

18:54.508 --> 18:57.177
to talk about you feeling

18:57.219 --> 18:59.388
and about a thing

18:57.219 --> 18:59.388
that happen a long time ago

18:59.430 --> 19:00.974
[voice breaking]

18:59.430 --> 19:00.974
with parent who not even...

19:02.558 --> 19:04.727
-What's happening?

19:02.558 --> 19:04.727
-It's a breakthrough.

19:04.769 --> 19:06.395
Or a breakdown. I don't know.

19:06.437 --> 19:08.230
-I say we vote him out.

19:06.437 --> 19:08.230
-We're not voting.

19:08.272 --> 19:10.733
Well, my husband

19:08.272 --> 19:10.733
is strongest of all husband.

19:10.775 --> 19:13.235
He work so hard

19:10.775 --> 19:13.235
and never complain. Almost.

19:13.277 --> 19:17.782
This is first time he ever talk

19:13.277 --> 19:17.782
about family or his daddy.

19:17.824 --> 19:19.325
And he make me so proud.

19:21.243 --> 19:23.329
I think this is time

19:21.243 --> 19:23.329
for a healing circle.

19:24.246 --> 19:25.372
Everyone, come on.

19:25.414 --> 19:26.457
It's okay.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.168
Please, no, no.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.168
[laughs nervously]

19:33.756 --> 19:35.008
-This is weird.

19:33.756 --> 19:35.008
-Shh.

19:38.218 --> 19:40.179
-[Kimchee] What's going on?

19:38.218 --> 19:40.179
-[whispers] It's

19:38.218 --> 19:40.179
happening again.

19:40.805 --> 19:42.222
I know. I can't help it.

19:42.264 --> 19:44.224
One website says

19:42.264 --> 19:44.224
it's a low blood pressure.

19:44.266 --> 19:46.560
In there. Shannon and Alejandro.

19:46.602 --> 19:48.354
In a storage room?

19:48.395 --> 19:50.272
What is with this guy?

19:50.314 --> 19:51.524
Is it bad that

19:50.314 --> 19:51.524
I'm kind of impressed?

19:55.528 --> 19:57.237
-See you tonight?

19:55.528 --> 19:57.237
-Yeah.

19:57.279 --> 19:58.781
-Hey, Kimchee.

19:57.279 --> 19:58.781
-Hey, boss.

19:58.823 --> 20:00.240
Did you find what you were

19:58.823 --> 20:00.240
looking for in there?

20:00.282 --> 20:01.283
Mmm-hmm.

20:02.118 --> 20:03.202
[sighs]

20:07.874 --> 20:10.877
It's funny. This whole

20:07.874 --> 20:10.877
Rhonda thing has had me

20:07.874 --> 20:10.877
seeing Rhondas everywhere.

20:10.918 --> 20:13.504
At the mall,

20:10.918 --> 20:13.504
Chelsea's dressage club mixer,

20:13.546 --> 20:14.797
over there in the lineup.

20:17.299 --> 20:19.677
Oh, my God, that is her.

20:19.719 --> 20:21.303
Oh, wow, really?

20:24.724 --> 20:27.267
Hey, Rhonda.

20:24.724 --> 20:27.267
Janet, from the other day.

20:27.309 --> 20:29.269
Right!

20:29.311 --> 20:30.563
I guess we like the same spot.

20:30.604 --> 20:32.272
-[chuckles]

20:30.604 --> 20:32.272
-Yeah.

20:32.314 --> 20:34.358
So, funny story.

20:32.314 --> 20:34.358
I emailed you.

20:34.400 --> 20:36.610
Oh, sorry. I've been so swamped.

20:36.652 --> 20:38.821
-Don't worry, I'll get to it.

20:36.652 --> 20:38.821
-Yeah.

20:38.863 --> 20:40.447
But it might be hard

20:38.863 --> 20:40.447
to respond to you

20:40.489 --> 20:43.659
considering you gave me

20:40.489 --> 20:43.659
a fake email address.

20:43.701 --> 20:45.786
If you don't want

20:43.701 --> 20:45.786
to hear from me, which I get,

20:45.828 --> 20:49.790
it'd be easier to just say no

20:45.828 --> 20:49.790
instead of, I dunno, lying.

20:49.832 --> 20:53.460
Yeah, the thing is that

20:49.832 --> 20:53.460
sometimes I mess up my emails

20:53.502 --> 20:55.671
'cause I'm dyslexic.

20:55.713 --> 20:57.506
-Hmm?

20:55.713 --> 20:57.506
-Yeah, I don't like

20:55.713 --> 20:57.506
to talk about it,

20:57.548 --> 20:59.258
but there it is.

21:00.134 --> 21:01.301
I'm so sorry.

21:01.343 --> 21:02.887
You must think I'm a huge jerk,

21:02.929 --> 21:05.723
but I'm just,

21:02.929 --> 21:05.723
you know, passionate.

21:05.765 --> 21:07.266
Yeah, it's okay.

21:07.307 --> 21:09.102
And maybe, as committed artists,

21:09.143 --> 21:11.311
we could just start over

21:09.143 --> 21:11.311
on the right foot.

21:11.353 --> 21:14.107
Maybe it's best we just

21:11.353 --> 21:14.107
leave things as they are.

21:17.068 --> 21:19.445
I can't wait to write

21:17.068 --> 21:19.445
Beekeeper Rhonda about this.

21:21.363 --> 21:23.282
