Everyone's up in the Longhouse.

- All right.

04:06.208 --> 04:07.041
Okay.

04:07.125 --> 04:08.333
[man] Oh. Uh…

04:08.416 --> 04:10.000
Den was asking where you were.

04:11.750 --> 04:14.791
He and his brother
got a big snow-elk, male.

04:14.875 --> 04:16.833
He wanted you to see it
before he dressed it.

04:16.916 --> 04:18.625
Why was he asking for me?

04:18.708 --> 04:20.625
Well, you know, because he's…

04:21.791 --> 04:22.958
I, I just thought…

04:24.083 --> 04:25.458
I just thought…

04:25.541 --> 04:26.541
You thought?

04:28.166 --> 04:29.041
[chuckles softly]

It's been a while since we've had
fresh meat. Forgot how good it is.

04:53.583 --> 04:56.125
[man] Den said they saw
the summer herds returning.

04:56.208 --> 04:58.041

[folk music continues]

05:00.916 --> 05:03.375
- He was asking for you.
- [Kora] I heard.

05:05.041 --> 05:06.708
And, yes, it's quite impressive.

05:06.791 --> 05:09.416
Which one? The animal?

05:11.416 --> 05:12.250
Or…

05:14.458 --> 05:15.875
[Den whoops]

05:19.125 --> 05:20.500
Or the hunter?

My people,

05:33.708 --> 05:36.875
it is my duty
as the head of this community

05:36.958 --> 05:40.958
to remind you that
the gods of the harvest demand a tribute.

05:41.791 --> 05:42.791
[villager] Yeah.

05:42.875 --> 05:44.166
[leader] An offering.

05:44.833 --> 05:48.041
But we all know
it is the thrusting of hips…

05:48.125 --> 05:49.208
[villagers exclaiming]

05:49.291 --> 05:55.625
…and the loud sounds of pleasure
that summon the seedlings to sprout.

05:55.708 --> 05:57.291
- [villagers laugh] Yeah!
- [chuckles]

05:57.375 --> 05:59.416
So make love tonight.

05:59.500 --> 06:03.250
For the harvest. For the very food we eat.

06:03.333 --> 06:05.166
- Yeah!
- [villagers] Yeah!

06:05.250 --> 06:06.333
For the gods!

You should be asleep.

He's the best hunter among us.

06:56.125 --> 06:57.375
And a loyal friend.

07:00.791 --> 07:04.208
Have you thought of
a more permanent relationship?

07:05.083 --> 07:07.250
I know that he's amenable to the idea.

07:08.583 --> 07:10.250
He's asked me himself.

07:11.083 --> 07:12.458
It's easy between us.

07:14.791 --> 07:16.500
Does it have to be more than that?

07:20.416 --> 07:21.583
It's just, uh…

07:23.916 --> 07:27.541
That would be your last step to becoming
a full member of this community.

07:29.125 --> 07:31.750
I'm telling you, this is home now.

07:35.208 --> 07:36.625
I want that to be true.

07:37.625 --> 07:39.625
[wistful music plays]

07:42.416 --> 07:43.416
You know,

07:45.041 --> 07:48.458
the two seasons I've spent here
have given me happiness

07:49.750 --> 07:51.125
that I don't deserve.

07:53.958 --> 07:56.291
But understand, I am a child of war.

07:58.583 --> 08:02.541
To truly love and be loved, I…

08:04.458 --> 08:06.541
I don't know if I'm capable of either.

08:09.875 --> 08:15.666
The very idea of love,
of… family was beaten out of me.

08:18.916 --> 08:20.958
I was taught that love is weakness.

08:24.333 --> 08:25.333
And I…

08:27.583 --> 08:29.791
I don't know how that will ever change.

08:38.458 --> 08:39.833
You should get some rest.

08:42.625 --> 08:43.541
Yeah.

08:55.625 --> 08:57.583
[woman] I noticed
you left early last night.

08:58.208 --> 08:59.625
Were you tired?

08:59.708 --> 09:02.500
[Kora] That's right.
I thought I'd make it an early night.

09:02.583 --> 09:05.083
I thought you were
doing your part for the harvest.

09:05.166 --> 09:07.833
Because as I walked home,
I passed Den's house.

09:07.916 --> 09:09.875
- That's what it sounded like.
- [Kora laughs]

09:09.958 --> 09:12.208
Sam, I don't know
what you're talking about.

09:12.791 --> 09:13.791

09:13.875 --> 09:15.041
[Sam] I think you do.

[villagers murmur]

10:20.666 --> 10:23.125
I don't care
what the potential upside might be,

10:23.208 --> 10:25.833
a warship hanging over our land
cannot be good.

10:25.916 --> 10:29.125
That's your problem.
Your first reaction is always fear.

10:29.208 --> 10:31.083
The Motherworld has deep pockets.

10:31.166 --> 10:33.791
I'm simply saying
maybe we can get a better price

10:33.875 --> 10:35.541
from our friends in low orbit there,

10:35.625 --> 10:38.541
rather than having to deal with
the cutthroats in Providence,

10:38.625 --> 10:40.916
selling our grain to God only knows.

[villagers chatter]

10:42.291 --> 10:45.083
Don't act like we don't know
you've been selling our surplus grain

10:45.166 --> 10:46.916
to the enemies of that ship up there.

10:48.166 --> 10:52.083
I wonder what they would say if they
found out where our excess went last year.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.500
Well, I'm no revolutionary.

10:55.208 --> 10:57.791
They offered the best price.
I don't care about their cause.

10:57.875 --> 10:58.833
Obviously.

10:59.500 --> 11:00.458
[scoffs]

11:00.541 --> 11:03.708
Sindri, I don't have a side,
only this community.

11:03.791 --> 11:05.541
That's my only loyalty.

11:06.833 --> 11:10.333
And I say we start
by showing them goodwill, not fear.

11:11.083 --> 11:14.625
That we are their partners,
not their adversaries, right?

11:15.958 --> 11:18.333
Did you say "partner," Gunnar?

11:18.416 --> 11:19.916
I did. Is that a problem?

11:20.000 --> 11:22.208
That ship does not represent prosperity.

11:23.250 --> 11:27.125
Its purpose is to destroy,
to subjugate, to enslave.

11:27.208 --> 11:30.125
- Partnership is not in its vocabulary.
- [villagers gasp]

11:30.208 --> 11:31.625
Give them what they ask for.

11:31.708 --> 11:34.458
But volunteer nothing
about how fertile this land is.

11:35.625 --> 11:37.333
And hope they leave
before digging too deep

11:37.416 --> 11:39.333
into who Gunnar sold last year's grain to.

11:39.416 --> 11:42.750
- Right.
- I've heard enough. We volunteer nothing.

11:42.833 --> 11:44.125
Is that clear?

Hello. I am Sindri,
father of this village.

13:20.041 --> 13:20.916
Welcome.

13:21.666 --> 13:23.416
I'm Admiral Atticus Noble.

13:23.500 --> 13:25.791
Loyal representative of the slain King.

13:25.875 --> 13:27.583
I welcome you to his warm embrace.

13:45.625 --> 13:49.333
Please, father,
tell me about this beautiful village.

13:50.416 --> 13:52.291
Walk with me up to our Longhouse.

13:52.375 --> 13:55.583
We can have a cup of ale
and I will tell you about life here.

13:55.666 --> 13:59.166
Oh. Sounds perfect. Lead the way.

14:14.916 --> 14:17.125
[Sindri] We've carved out
a simple life here.

14:18.041 --> 14:20.666
And we take pride
in the love of our community,

14:20.750 --> 14:22.875
and the hard work
it takes to survive here.

14:23.750 --> 14:25.958
[Noble] Your people
seem healthy and well-fed.

14:26.041 --> 14:28.958
As their leader, much of that prosperity
must be credited to you.

14:29.041 --> 14:31.958
No, we are a community.
The credit is no one person's.

14:32.041 --> 14:34.375
Oh, I know that in the best of times,
the credit's shared,

14:34.458 --> 14:38.000
but when the stores are empty,
you know where the responsibility falls.

14:38.583 --> 14:41.083
The weight of the leader, I suppose.

14:43.458 --> 14:47.583
So you… you understand
the feeling of, like, a father,

14:47.666 --> 14:50.041
the need to feed your children, yes?

14:51.875 --> 14:54.583
I was hoping that your land
and the people of Veldt might help

14:54.666 --> 14:58.333
as we search for a small band
of revolutionaries hiding in this system.

14:59.166 --> 15:03.166
Who my commander, the Regent Balisarius,
bid me find and bring to justice.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.750
We are humble farmers,

15:05.833 --> 15:08.291
far removed from the politics
of the Motherworld.

15:08.375 --> 15:11.958
- [ax clatters]
- And still you can serve. Hmm.

15:12.041 --> 15:15.458
The rebels we seek
have been attacking our supply ports.

15:15.541 --> 15:19.250
Led by a woman named Devra Bloodaxe,
and her brother Darrian.

15:20.375 --> 15:21.958
Their capture's inevitable.

15:22.041 --> 15:25.083
However,
it's taken longer than anticipated,

15:25.166 --> 15:27.958
and we found ourselves
admittedly low on stores.

15:28.541 --> 15:32.625
And as you know or may have heard,
an army runs on its stomach.

15:33.541 --> 15:37.500
I was thinking of a partnership,
where you supply us with food.

15:38.166 --> 15:40.083
Whatever you have to spare, of course.

15:40.791 --> 15:42.541
In exchange, you're compensated at…

15:43.666 --> 15:45.583
Let's call it triple
the market value, shall we?

15:46.791 --> 15:50.416
With that windfall, you'll be able
to buy plenty of harvesters, robots,

15:50.500 --> 15:52.708
and won't have to do
this difficult work by hand.

15:55.375 --> 15:59.416
We believe that doing the work by hand
connects us to the land

15:59.500 --> 16:02.333
and honors these sacred fields
that give us life.

16:02.416 --> 16:05.416
[Noble] There's peace of mind knowing
that you're invaluable

16:05.500 --> 16:08.916
in the important mission of
rooting out enemies of the Motherworld.

16:21.791 --> 16:24.041
- [Sindri] It's quite a proposal.
- [Noble] Yes.

16:24.125 --> 16:26.041
[Sindri] If only we had
some surplus to offer.

16:26.125 --> 16:28.000
You see, the land is rocky

16:28.083 --> 16:31.916
and yields barely enough
to feed ourselves.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.875
So, it is with sincere apologies
that we must decline the offer.

16:35.708 --> 16:36.791
However, we are grateful

16:36.875 --> 16:40.541
for the presence of such
a benevolent and powerful protector.

16:43.208 --> 16:44.916
Huh.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
No surplus?

16:47.500 --> 16:49.583
- None at all?
- [chuckles]

16:50.625 --> 16:51.791
[Noble] Huh.

16:51.875 --> 16:53.416
But your land looks so fertile.

16:53.500 --> 16:56.791
Your fields seem larger
than what your population might need.

16:56.875 --> 16:58.875
Of course, I understand how it might seem.

16:58.958 --> 17:03.250
Yet the scale of the planting
is evidence of the poor soil.

17:03.333 --> 17:06.291
And our harsh winters
only add to the short season.

17:06.375 --> 17:08.833
Now, what do you say
we share that cup of ale, eh?

17:11.750 --> 17:13.041
[Noble scoffs]

17:21.291 --> 17:22.291
Sorry.

17:23.500 --> 17:24.333
It's just…

17:25.625 --> 17:27.791
I mean, look at these beautiful people.

17:28.500 --> 17:32.083
I can't imagine these glowing complexions
are nourished by a barren field.

17:33.750 --> 17:34.583
[Noble chuckles]

17:36.541 --> 17:40.833
Now… who's the man or woman among you
who oversees the harvest?

17:45.000 --> 17:47.416
There must be one
whose thumb is greener than the rest.

17:48.208 --> 17:49.333
[Noble chuckles]

17:49.416 --> 17:50.333
Someone?

17:51.666 --> 17:52.583
Hmm?

17:53.375 --> 17:54.458
[Gunnar] Yes, sir.

17:54.541 --> 17:55.958
- [Noble] Ah.
- That is me.

17:56.833 --> 17:57.666
[Noble] Good.

17:57.750 --> 17:59.708
Yes, I oversee the harvest.

18:00.458 --> 18:03.458
Well, if these people trust you,
then so do I.

18:04.750 --> 18:08.000
Trying to understand how I could be
so wrong about what this land could yield.

18:08.083 --> 18:09.291
That's all.

18:11.875 --> 18:13.541
Well, sir.

18:16.208 --> 18:22.000
Sindri, our beloved father, is always
looking out for the welfare of our village

18:22.083 --> 18:26.125
and so insists on keeping reserves
in case of famine or drought,

18:26.208 --> 18:28.916
which, as you know,
is the responsibility of a leader.

18:31.750 --> 18:35.125
[splutters] But we have been lucky
these last few seasons.

18:36.041 --> 18:38.250
Our surplus has been
more than we can store.

18:39.500 --> 18:40.791
So, there might be

18:41.791 --> 18:44.416
a chance that we can spare a small amount.

18:45.041 --> 18:47.083
Depending, of course,
on the scale of your needs.

18:47.166 --> 18:48.625
Mmm. Good. Good.

18:49.250 --> 18:53.000
Yeah, I mean, it's always wise
to hold some in reserve, isn't it, father?

18:54.500 --> 18:56.375
Yep. Yep.

19:01.333 --> 19:02.708
I am confused though.

19:03.583 --> 19:05.208
Curious why you should have me believe

19:05.291 --> 19:07.583
this land could barely yield enough
to feed your people.

19:07.666 --> 19:10.208
- Seems that wasn't entirely true.
- [Gunnar] No, wait, wait.

19:10.291 --> 19:13.708
Admiral, no one is trying to mislead you.

19:14.708 --> 19:18.791
Sindri simply has a slightly more
conservative view on reserves than I do.

19:19.625 --> 19:22.458
But we're both excited
about a possible partnership.

19:24.250 --> 19:26.833
Just bear in mind
the reality of what we can supply.

19:33.208 --> 19:34.666
Father, who is this exactly?

19:35.750 --> 19:37.916
- Uh… My…
- [Sindri] He's of no consequence.

19:38.583 --> 19:41.208
I have been empowered
by my people to speak for them.

19:41.875 --> 19:44.208
This man has no authority here.

19:45.083 --> 19:47.666
You would be wise to ignore him.

19:48.375 --> 19:50.375
[Noble] Well… a rift.

19:51.125 --> 19:53.916
It's not quite
the idyllic community I'd first seen.

19:54.583 --> 19:56.625
Father, if I may

19:58.041 --> 20:02.750
offer you some advice when dealing with
subordinates who need to be kept in place.

20:03.541 --> 20:07.625
I find people can lose sight of the stakes
and sometimes need a gentle reminder

20:08.208 --> 20:11.083
of just how those with power
deal with those without.

20:40.458 --> 20:41.458
[Sindri] Admiral.

20:42.208 --> 20:43.375
Sindri…

20:43.958 --> 20:44.916
Please.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.041
- No, I… I would never…
- It's fine.

20:49.708 --> 20:51.833
[Noble sighs]

20:52.416 --> 20:55.250
- [nervously] I…
- Let me show you what I mean.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.000
Uh…

20:57.916 --> 20:58.916
[Sindri] Please.

21:01.208 --> 21:02.083
Admiral.

21:04.375 --> 21:05.250
[villagers gasp]

21:09.916 --> 21:11.125
[Noble yells]

21:11.208 --> 21:12.625
[Gunnar] No, stop!

21:12.708 --> 21:14.333
[villagers scream]

21:14.416 --> 21:15.250
[villager] No!

21:16.583 --> 21:17.625
[Krypteian blade buzzes]

21:17.708 --> 21:19.708
[villagers scream]

21:21.458 --> 21:23.708
[she sobs]

21:26.916 --> 21:28.000
[Gunnar] What did you do?

21:29.333 --> 21:30.791
When can I expect my harvest?

21:31.958 --> 21:33.291
[shuddering] Oh…

21:33.375 --> 21:34.375
I don't…

21:36.000 --> 21:39.125
I said, tell me, partner,
when I can expect my harvest.

21:39.208 --> 21:41.833
Uh… Um… [splutters]

21:41.916 --> 21:44.208
- Nine… nine weeks.
- Very well.

21:46.083 --> 21:47.708
In ten weeks, I shall return.

21:48.958 --> 21:51.333
You shall have
my 10,000 bushels prepared for my ship.

21:51.916 --> 21:55.375
Twelve… We barely produce 12,000 bushels.

21:55.458 --> 21:56.750
We'll starve to death.

21:57.541 --> 21:59.375
I don't understand what you want.

22:00.125 --> 22:01.125
Well, it's simple.

22:03.375 --> 22:04.625
I want everything.

22:06.416 --> 22:08.416
[dropship engines blast]

22:22.583 --> 22:23.666
All right, listen up.

22:23.750 --> 22:26.583
I need all of this gear moved
to this big stone building.

22:26.666 --> 22:28.208
That should suit us for now.

22:28.291 --> 22:32.000
Marcus, you're gonna help me evict
the current residents from our new home.

22:32.083 --> 22:32.958
Copy?

22:33.500 --> 22:34.625
Copy you, boss.

22:36.125 --> 22:37.125
Copy you.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.125
Hello, everyone.

22:41.250 --> 22:43.250
- [lever clanks]
- [air hissing]

22:55.625 --> 22:59.250
I am JC-1435
of the Mechanicas Militarium,

22:59.333 --> 23:00.583
defender of the King.

23:01.166 --> 23:03.791
Correction, of the slain King.

23:03.875 --> 23:05.708
It is my honor to serve.

23:06.833 --> 23:07.833
I'm Private Aris.

23:08.625 --> 23:12.375
We're moving supplies to that building,
if you wouldn't mind lending a hand.

23:12.958 --> 23:14.375
Thank you, Private Aris.

23:14.458 --> 23:17.333
That falls perfectly into my protocols.

23:17.875 --> 23:20.958
[Marcus] I'm talking to you,
you dirty drain turtle. Come here.

23:21.041 --> 23:23.000
[shouts] The hell you waiting for?
Get out, man!

23:24.791 --> 23:25.958
[shouts aggressively]

23:29.125 --> 23:30.500
[whistles]

23:38.416 --> 23:39.708
[Marcus] Mmm.

23:47.875 --> 23:49.125
Thank you.

23:56.791 --> 23:58.375
[ladle clatters]

24:01.833 --> 24:04.291
Now, what in the name of the old gods
are you looking at?

24:04.375 --> 24:08.166
I'm sorry, I was just waiting to see
if you needed some more water.

24:08.250 --> 24:09.333
Some more water?

24:10.041 --> 24:11.208
[shouts aggressively]

24:12.041 --> 24:13.291
[makes kissing sound]

24:13.375 --> 24:17.708
That's how I like 'em.
Young, strong enough to put up a fight.

24:19.500 --> 24:20.625
[commander chuckles]

24:21.583 --> 24:22.875
- Boss.
- [commander] Hmm?

24:22.958 --> 24:24.375
Look, they left us a Jimmy.

24:26.375 --> 24:27.625
It's a Jimmy, man.

24:27.708 --> 24:29.416
[howling]

24:30.583 --> 24:32.541
I didn't know we had any of those left.

24:38.833 --> 24:41.958
All right, careful. The ground's uneven
till you get to the bridge.

24:42.041 --> 24:45.833
Thank you, Private Aris,
but I believe I can manage.

24:45.916 --> 24:47.541
[Marcus] They won't fight anymore.

24:47.625 --> 24:49.750
What do you mean they won't fight anymore?

24:49.833 --> 24:51.666
It's something in their programming.

24:51.750 --> 24:53.333
Once the King was killed,

24:53.416 --> 24:56.958
they just laid down their weapons
and refused to fight.

24:57.041 --> 25:00.875
Just watch, no matter what I do,
he doesn't fight back.

25:02.916 --> 25:05.708
- [plasma ricochets]
- [uraki whinnying]

25:05.791 --> 25:07.000
[Marcus] Hey!

25:07.083 --> 25:09.208
Careful with that stuff,
you stupid machine.

25:09.291 --> 25:11.791
I'll turn you into scrap, you dumbshit.
You hear me?

25:12.625 --> 25:14.208
You're not hearing me.

25:14.833 --> 25:16.500
[gun fires]

25:18.625 --> 25:20.458
[Aris] Hey! Stop.

25:22.916 --> 25:24.541
What if I shoot you instead, huh?

25:25.583 --> 25:28.416
I could kill you right now
and no one would care.

25:29.083 --> 25:30.875
- Would they?
- [commander] That's enough.

25:30.958 --> 25:33.333
What do you say? Wanna die?

25:33.416 --> 25:34.500
What's it, huh?

25:34.583 --> 25:35.416
Come on, boy.

25:37.208 --> 25:38.333
[gun powers down]

25:38.416 --> 25:39.458
I said, enough.

25:44.333 --> 25:49.833
Get these crates
into that house now, Private.

25:50.416 --> 25:51.416
Yes, boss.

25:59.666 --> 26:01.000
Are you malfunctioning?

26:02.125 --> 26:03.250
No, sir.

26:05.416 --> 26:08.250
Get up. Go to the river. Clean yourself.

26:11.166 --> 26:13.041
The rest of you, stop staring.

26:13.125 --> 26:14.291
Get back to work.

26:14.375 --> 26:15.958
[Marcus] Get back to work, assholes.

26:16.041 --> 26:18.041
[commander] That includes you, Marcus.

26:18.125 --> 26:19.500
[soldier 1] You got it?

26:20.583 --> 26:21.708
[crate clangs]

26:26.000 --> 26:27.166
[Marcus grunts]

26:44.500 --> 26:45.500
[Sam] Excuse me.

26:49.875 --> 26:52.291
[JC-1435] Thank you. That is kind.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.708
- You're a soldier?
- Long ago.

26:58.666 --> 27:00.791
Do you mind? I'm Sam.

27:00.875 --> 27:01.875
[JC-1435] Please.

27:09.750 --> 27:13.708
Tell me, Sam.
Do you know the story of our slain King

27:13.791 --> 27:17.666
and his beautiful daughter,
the Princess Issa?

27:17.750 --> 27:18.791
I don't.

27:18.875 --> 27:22.208
Well, you remind me of her.

27:23.000 --> 27:27.125
In myth, she was called
the Chalice or the Redeemer.

27:27.708 --> 27:30.041
She was <i>pueri salvatoris.</i>

27:30.125 --> 27:32.291
And even before she was born,

27:32.375 --> 27:35.333
I and my brothers
pledged everything we were,

27:35.416 --> 27:38.500
everything that dwells
inside this metal skin,

27:38.583 --> 27:40.166
to fight in her name.

27:41.333 --> 27:45.666
So when word reached us
on some distant battlefield

27:45.750 --> 27:50.291
that she, as prophesied, had been born
of flesh and blood into our world,

27:50.375 --> 27:54.166
I felt a great warmth for the universe

27:54.958 --> 28:00.041
and trusted that she was to usher in
a new age of peace and compassion.

28:01.833 --> 28:03.375
And bring us home.

28:05.833 --> 28:07.208
She was magic.

28:07.833 --> 28:10.791
[JC-1435] Ah, yes.
She was more than magic.

28:13.250 --> 28:15.208
On the day of her coronation,

28:15.291 --> 28:18.625
she, along with
our honored King and Queen,

28:18.708 --> 28:23.791
were assassinated in cold blood
by those they trusted most.

28:25.291 --> 28:29.416
I fear we lost some measure
of our honor since that betrayal.

28:31.083 --> 28:34.583
I'm afraid our compassion, our kindness,

28:35.375 --> 28:36.458
our very joy,

28:37.625 --> 28:40.916
died with that young girl.

28:49.833 --> 28:51.791
I think it lives in you.

29:33.583 --> 29:34.958
This is your fault, Gunnar!

29:35.041 --> 29:37.041
I didn't know that he would kill them.

29:37.125 --> 29:38.750
Doesn't matter. He's dead now.

29:38.833 --> 29:42.125
[villager 1] What about the soldiers?
Next, it's gonna be the other house.

29:42.208 --> 29:44.416
- [villager 2] I don't know.
- Stop, please.

29:44.500 --> 29:47.791
How about we bring in the crop
and we fall on their mercy?

29:47.875 --> 29:48.791
[villager 3] Yeah.

29:48.875 --> 29:51.458
We make ourselves invaluable.
They wouldn't be able to kill us.

29:51.541 --> 29:53.833
- They would need us.
- He's right.

29:53.916 --> 29:58.791
Farming, that is our skill
that we can do, that they cannot.

29:58.875 --> 30:02.125
If we show them how good we are,
they will be forced to spare us.

30:02.208 --> 30:03.541
- Yes.
- Yes. Yeah.

30:03.625 --> 30:06.916
- Do we agree? Our work fights for us.
- [all] Yes!

30:07.000 --> 30:08.916
- Our work fights for us. Yes?
- [villagers] Yes!

30:10.833 --> 30:11.791
[Den] It's settled then.

30:11.875 --> 30:14.125
- We show them how valuable we are.
- [villager 3] Okay.

30:14.208 --> 30:16.333
[Den] And when we have fulfilled
our side of the deal,

30:16.416 --> 30:19.333
they will be forced to rethink
how much food they leave us.

30:19.416 --> 30:20.416
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

30:20.958 --> 30:24.333
We can appeal to those gentlemen
in the granary, appeal to their humanity.

30:24.416 --> 30:25.750
- [villager 3] Yeah.
- Good.

30:33.916 --> 30:36.833
So… it's running.

30:39.500 --> 30:41.833
Would've thought
you'd have had enough of that.

30:43.166 --> 30:45.708
You heard them. They're delusional.

30:45.791 --> 30:49.416
They think those soldiers will show mercy
even after what they did to Sindri,

30:49.958 --> 30:51.291
right in front of them.

30:56.750 --> 30:59.166
When I found you
in the wreckage of that ship,

31:00.083 --> 31:01.666
I considered leaving you.

31:02.625 --> 31:04.750
I was afraid
you could bring trouble to us.

31:06.833 --> 31:10.333
But do I for a moment
regret bringing you into our lives?

31:10.416 --> 31:11.833
I do not.

31:12.916 --> 31:14.291
You've become a part of us.

31:15.166 --> 31:18.625
And yet, now you leave
when we need you most.

31:19.625 --> 31:21.416
When your people need you.

31:26.375 --> 31:27.375
I can't.

31:28.416 --> 31:29.458
You mean, you won't?

31:30.958 --> 31:32.375
This place is already lost.

31:32.458 --> 31:34.208
But what if that could change?

31:34.291 --> 31:37.375
What if we <i>did </i>fight,
not only us, but others?

31:37.458 --> 31:39.625
- Who else would come here and fight?
- Others! Others!

31:39.708 --> 31:43.708
Others that have reason to hate
all that the Motherworld represents.

31:46.333 --> 31:49.083
Kora, you know this universe
better than I.

31:50.750 --> 31:54.916
What if you could find
the warriors that Noble seeks?

31:55.000 --> 31:58.500
The outlaws to fight alongside us?

31:59.250 --> 32:02.375
If I find warriors to fight for Veldt,
I give the village hope.

32:03.375 --> 32:05.583
If I give them hope,
they fight and surely lose.

32:06.625 --> 32:08.666
I won't have that blood on my hands.

32:09.458 --> 32:12.333
Nor will I throw my life away
the same as the rest of you.

32:13.541 --> 32:15.541
[melancholy violin music plays]

32:38.791 --> 32:39.791
Check this.

32:40.541 --> 32:41.583
Hey, water girl!

32:42.166 --> 32:43.541
[grunts]

32:43.625 --> 32:45.166
- [Marcus] Come here.
- [Sam] What is it?

32:45.250 --> 32:47.125
Did you need some more water?

32:47.208 --> 32:49.916
Just a… a little water.

32:50.416 --> 32:51.333
Stop it!

32:51.416 --> 32:53.041
[bucket clatters]

This all sounds nice,

38:19.291 --> 38:21.166
I found it at the site of the crash.

38:29.041 --> 38:30.458
I thought it was lost.

38:33.875 --> 38:36.125
Our culture is not for such weapons.

[guardian gun hums]

I feared it could be dangerous.

38:44.291 --> 38:45.458
You were right.

38:46.375 --> 38:47.208
Thank you.

38:50.291 --> 38:51.666
Where will you go?

38:52.625 --> 38:55.250
There is someone, a general named Titus.

38:55.958 --> 38:57.708
Once a hero of the Realm

38:57.791 --> 39:00.750
who turned his own forces
against those of the Motherworld.

39:02.083 --> 39:04.416
Last I heard,
he was still out there somewhere.

39:05.166 --> 39:07.500
If I could find him
and men for him to lead…

39:10.250 --> 39:11.083
Gunnar.

39:12.208 --> 39:15.458
Last year, in Providence,
you sold grain to the resistance.

39:19.291 --> 39:23.125
Yes. I met a man there
who introduced me to the insurgents.

39:23.708 --> 39:24.708
The Bloodaxes.

39:25.708 --> 39:28.416
- Would he still know how to find them?
- It's possible.

39:29.250 --> 39:30.666
Then you'll take me to him?

39:31.875 --> 39:33.041
Of course I will.

39:34.375 --> 39:35.500
[uraki whinnying]

39:36.916 --> 39:40.125
[Gunnar] Hey! Bring down one more uraki!

39:44.375 --> 39:46.166
A general and an army?

39:48.500 --> 39:50.208
We might stand a chance.

39:54.833 --> 39:55.833
Be careful.

[Gunnar] So you were a soldier
for the Motherworld?

40:54.250 --> 40:55.625
Fighting for the Realm?

40:59.166 --> 41:00.416
[Kora] You could say that.

41:04.125 --> 41:05.541
Of high rank, I suppose?

41:09.500 --> 41:11.500
[animals bay in distance]

41:14.375 --> 41:16.083
I mean, are you wanted for desertion?

That and more.

41:20.125 --> 41:21.041
Okay.

41:22.791 --> 41:24.375
Anything else you wanna ask me?

41:25.750 --> 41:27.500
[Gunnar] They won't just kill us,
will they?

41:28.541 --> 41:31.708
I mean, I understand
making an example of Sindri

41:33.250 --> 41:34.416
to keep us in line.

41:36.500 --> 41:38.708
But we're just farmers,
we're not a threat.

41:39.500 --> 41:41.500
How can you know they will destroy us?

41:43.041 --> 41:46.208
When they first came to my world,
I was nine years old.

41:47.583 --> 41:49.583

51:18.291 --> 51:21.375
Of course, General Titus.

51:23.500 --> 51:28.750
Crazy bastard. Turned his own men
on the Motherworld's forces [grunts]

51:28.833 --> 51:30.875
at the Battle of Sarawu.

51:32.208 --> 51:34.166
Do you know of his location?

51:34.750 --> 51:38.375
Last I heard,
he was fighting in the coliseum at Pollux.

51:39.458 --> 51:41.291
[growls]

51:41.375 --> 51:43.041
[creature chitters]

51:43.125 --> 51:45.375
I'd be careful if I were you, little miss.

51:45.458 --> 51:49.250
Last hunter who went looking for him
ended up with his head on a pike

51:50.625 --> 51:52.583
outside the coliseum entrance

51:53.333 --> 51:56.416
as a warning not to bother him.

51:57.583 --> 52:00.333
[gasps]

52:02.041 --> 52:03.250
[groans]

52:03.833 --> 52:05.208
So, he's on Pollux.

52:06.541 --> 52:08.916
- That's your plan?
- That's my plan.

52:11.625 --> 52:12.458
What?

52:12.541 --> 52:14.625
Guess we need to
find a ship to take us to Pollux.

52:15.958 --> 52:17.250
You're catching on.

52:19.833 --> 52:21.958
Hey! Bitch!

52:22.583 --> 52:24.250
[chuckles]

52:24.750 --> 52:25.750
Oh.

52:25.833 --> 52:27.958
You should have killed me.

52:28.041 --> 52:29.458
Now you're gonna die.

52:31.375 --> 52:36.625
I'm gonna give you one chance
to just turn and walk away.

52:36.708 --> 52:38.000
Uh-oh.

52:38.083 --> 52:42.541
Are you gonna give all of us one chance?

[Gunnar groans]

53:47.708 --> 53:48.750
[growls]

54:33.583 --> 54:34.583
Impressive.

54:38.833 --> 54:41.750
[Kora] Were those Hawkshaws that paid you
working for the Motherworld?

54:41.833 --> 54:44.291
- I don't like bounty hunters.
- [man] I didn't ask.

54:44.375 --> 54:47.083
And to be clear,
I don't like bounty hunters either.

54:47.166 --> 54:48.458
[Kora] So you're a gun for hire?

54:48.541 --> 54:50.583
No. That's not my thing.

54:51.500 --> 54:54.541
I'm more of an opportunist, you might say.

54:54.625 --> 54:55.875
A real hero, huh?

54:56.750 --> 54:58.416
[door opens]

54:58.500 --> 54:59.500
Wait.

55:02.375 --> 55:04.541
Look. I heard you in there,

55:04.625 --> 55:06.041
trying to get to Pollux.

55:07.125 --> 55:08.041
I could help you.

55:08.125 --> 55:11.000
Oh, understand, we're just simple farmers.

55:11.083 --> 55:14.166
We're searching for soldiers
for a fight against the Motherworld.

55:15.208 --> 55:18.375
We have some money,
but this is not the one you get rich on.

55:18.458 --> 55:20.041
Aye, I understand.

55:21.083 --> 55:23.125
Still, pay me what it's worth to you.

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
Soldiers for a fight
against the Motherworld?

55:29.375 --> 55:30.875
Well, my name's Kai.

55:30.958 --> 55:33.333
Come on, my ship's down at port.

56:01.208 --> 56:03.208
[dramatic music builds]

56:08.125 --> 56:10.125
Right. Setting course for Pollux.

56:10.208 --> 56:11.250
[buttons click]

56:11.333 --> 56:13.250
[Kai] I need to stop on Neu-Wodi first.

56:13.333 --> 56:15.583
You know, there's a rancher there.

56:15.666 --> 56:17.583
He has a man
that might just work out for you.

56:17.666 --> 56:19.166
Is he worth our time?

56:19.250 --> 56:21.250
Because we can't afford to waste any.

56:22.083 --> 56:23.291
I think you'll like him.

56:24.333 --> 56:25.708
You ever been off-planet?

56:25.791 --> 56:26.916
No.

56:27.000 --> 56:28.666
What did you do on the farm?

56:28.750 --> 56:33.041
I oversee the harvest, and planting,
cataloguing seeds, and making sure that…

56:33.125 --> 56:35.125
That sounds great.
You might want to hold on.

56:35.208 --> 56:36.625
[console beeps]

57:33.416 --> 57:35.083
Oh, Cassius, it's you. Good.

57:35.833 --> 57:38.291
[Cassius] We received a communiqué
from the Hawkshaws.

57:38.958 --> 57:41.208
They're requesting to rendezvous with us.

57:42.583 --> 57:44.500
Apparently they've captured a creature

57:44.583 --> 57:47.666
that has important information
about the insurgents,

57:47.750 --> 57:50.000
Devra Bloodaxe and her brother.

57:50.875 --> 57:53.000
Bloodaxe? Huh.

57:53.916 --> 57:55.458
- Well, that…
- [creatures chitter]

57:55.541 --> 57:56.875
That's excellent, Cassius.

57:57.916 --> 57:59.583
Inform me when they arrive.

57:59.666 --> 58:01.083
- [Cassius] Yes, sir.
- Hey.

58:01.166 --> 58:04.166
[ship engine sputters]

58:20.625 --> 58:25.166
Well, if it isn't
the bastard from Saaldorun.

58:25.250 --> 58:27.458
[man laughs]

58:27.541 --> 58:30.875
- What brings you all the way out here?
- I missed your smiling face.

58:30.958 --> 58:32.500
[man laughs]

58:32.583 --> 58:34.500
You still got
that man chained in the back?

58:34.583 --> 58:36.875
Tarak? Yeah,
he's working off his debt to me.

58:36.958 --> 58:40.500
Another couple dozen seasons,
we should be square.

58:40.583 --> 58:41.666
What's it to you?

58:42.166 --> 58:43.541
You mind if we talk to him?

58:44.708 --> 58:46.500
Could be a deal in it for ya.

58:46.583 --> 58:48.041
[bennu screeches]

58:48.125 --> 58:50.666
Well, if there's money to be made…

58:53.500 --> 58:54.708
Hey!

58:55.958 --> 58:57.625
Hey! Tarak!

58:59.166 --> 59:00.125
[metal sizzling]

59:00.208 --> 59:02.083
[man] These people want to talk to you.

59:03.750 --> 59:07.250
- What got that chain on your leg?
- [Tarak] A long road of mistakes.

59:08.250 --> 59:10.958
But if you're here to accuse me
of crimes against the Motherworld,

59:11.458 --> 59:13.291
I'm guilty as charged.
Take it up with him.

59:13.375 --> 59:15.333
No. That's not why we're here.

59:17.666 --> 59:21.375
We're here from a small village,
and we're looking to hire some fighters

59:21.458 --> 59:24.791
to train and protect us
against a force from the Motherworld.

59:25.958 --> 59:28.041
- I'm no friend of the Realm.
- Okay.

59:28.125 --> 59:29.625
[Tarak] That's well-known.

59:29.708 --> 59:31.625
And I'd gladly fight with you,

59:31.708 --> 59:34.375
but… I have a debt on my name,

59:34.458 --> 59:35.791
and I honor my debts.

59:37.125 --> 59:38.416
What's he owe you?

59:39.375 --> 59:40.666
[man] Uh…

59:40.750 --> 59:44.708
300,000 Darams ought to cover
any inconvenience I've suffered.

59:44.791 --> 59:46.208
Oh, ya bollocks.

59:46.291 --> 59:47.958
We don't have that kind of money.

59:48.041 --> 59:49.000
No money.

59:51.500 --> 59:54.750
Well, I do love to gamble.

59:55.333 --> 59:56.541
Here we go.

59:56.625 --> 59:57.541
What's the bet?

59:58.833 --> 01:00:02.500
If Tarak can break that creature
out there, his debts are squared with me.

01:00:02.583 --> 01:00:04.208
[chain rattles]

01:00:04.291 --> 01:00:05.541
[man] But if he don't ride him,

01:00:06.291 --> 01:00:09.208
you all get a chain and a shackle.

01:00:09.291 --> 01:00:10.583
That's the deal.

01:00:10.666 --> 01:00:11.875
[man] Grab it tighter!

01:00:11.958 --> 01:00:14.500
- [bennu screeches]
- [suspenseful music plays]

01:00:17.166 --> 01:00:18.250
Watch its tail!

Can you ride him?

01:00:21.583 --> 01:00:23.250
[bennu screeches]

01:00:28.583 --> 01:00:31.291
Yeah… I can ride him.

01:00:32.250 --> 01:00:33.458
[roars]

01:00:33.541 --> 01:00:36.291

Don't let him fight you like that!

[bennu screeches]

01:00:38.958 --> 01:00:40.083
Pull!

01:00:48.750 --> 01:00:51.000
[roars]

01:00:53.833 --> 01:00:54.750
Drop your leads.

01:00:54.833 --> 01:00:56.458
She'll tear you apart.

01:00:56.541 --> 01:00:59.416
Drop your leads and clear out now.

01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:01.750
Suit yourself. Drop them.

01:01:03.333 --> 01:01:05.833

[bennu screeches]

01:01:22.541 --> 01:01:25.583
You're far from home and so am I.

01:01:26.833 --> 01:01:28.875
See, you and I…

01:01:30.166 --> 01:01:31.333
…we are alike.

01:01:33.333 --> 01:01:35.833
We've been hurt. Betrayed.

01:01:35.916 --> 01:01:37.458
Our trust has been broken.

01:01:37.541 --> 01:01:39.750
[man inhales sharply, exhales]

01:01:42.375 --> 01:01:46.666
We both know fear.

01:01:47.416 --> 01:01:49.166
Yet, the biggest fear we both face…

01:01:58.375 --> 01:02:00.875
…is the fear of ourselves.

01:02:02.208 --> 01:02:04.833
- [bennu growls softly]
- [gentle music plays]

01:02:05.875 --> 01:02:06.875
[in English] That's it.

01:02:08.958 --> 01:02:12.666
[in Samandrait]
Let's show them we're not afraid.

01:02:13.291 --> 01:02:18.250
Let's show them we're more
than the shackles that bind us.

01:02:31.583 --> 01:02:33.000
[bennu screeches]

01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:39.625

01:25:14.166 --> 01:25:16.166
[dramatic music plays]

01:26:10.875 --> 01:26:15.791
Farmer, why would you contact us
from this unknown and flagless vessel?

01:26:15.875 --> 01:26:19.958
I was assuming we had a level of trust
after our last meeting.

01:26:20.041 --> 01:26:22.791
We bought your grain to feed our fighters.

01:26:23.375 --> 01:26:27.541
Do not confuse your business of commerce
with our business of revolution.

01:26:27.625 --> 01:26:29.125
[Gunnar] I understand.

01:26:29.208 --> 01:26:33.458
Your coming here is a great risk
to us all and to our benefactor.

01:26:33.541 --> 01:26:36.166
But we are no longer
in need of your grain.

01:26:36.250 --> 01:26:39.291
King Levitica's kindness
has been more than enough to sustain us,

01:26:39.375 --> 01:26:42.041
so I suggest you leave immediately.

01:26:42.125 --> 01:26:43.958
[Kora] We're not here to sell grain.

01:26:44.041 --> 01:26:46.083
Gunnar's village
was visited by a Dreadnought

01:26:46.166 --> 01:26:48.208
that threatens its very existence.

01:26:48.291 --> 01:26:49.875
I have recruited these warriors

01:26:49.958 --> 01:26:52.916
and given my word to bring them back
and defend the farmers.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.291
- But we're running out of time.
- What?

01:26:55.875 --> 01:26:58.625
This handful? Against a Dreadnought?

01:26:58.708 --> 01:27:01.208
That's why we have come.
You have men and ships.

01:27:01.958 --> 01:27:03.916
With you we could mount a real defense.

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:08.958
And, of course, we can pay you
with the surplus from our harvest.

01:27:10.708 --> 01:27:11.875
It's all we've got.

01:27:11.958 --> 01:27:14.125
[Devra] My forces against the King's Gaze?

01:27:14.208 --> 01:27:15.250
That's suicide.

01:27:15.833 --> 01:27:18.416
That ship cannot be destroyed
by a few dozen fighters.

01:27:18.958 --> 01:27:23.166
That ship and the men aboard it
are world destroyers.

01:27:23.250 --> 01:27:25.583
I'm sorry, it's impossible.

01:27:25.666 --> 01:27:27.833
[Kora] This man is not a revolutionary.

01:27:27.916 --> 01:27:29.666
He's a simple farmer.

01:27:29.750 --> 01:27:31.083
But commerce or not,

01:27:31.166 --> 01:27:35.000
his people toiled with their bare hands
to grow the grain that fed you.

01:27:35.083 --> 01:27:35.916
All of you!

01:27:36.541 --> 01:27:38.541
And because of that transaction,

01:27:38.625 --> 01:27:41.375
their village is now
threatened by Admiral Noble,

01:27:41.458 --> 01:27:44.291
in pursuit of <i>your </i>revolution.

01:27:47.916 --> 01:27:49.916
[suspenseful music plays]

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:07.000
I see.

01:28:12.208 --> 01:28:13.208
I will go.

01:28:15.416 --> 01:28:16.250
Thank you.

01:28:16.791 --> 01:28:18.666
Brother, a word.

01:28:26.958 --> 01:28:31.791
Our victories, what few there have been,
have been tactical ones.

01:28:31.875 --> 01:28:34.125
We cannot fight in the open
against the King's Gaze.

01:28:34.208 --> 01:28:38.041
If the farmer found us,
it won't be long before Noble does.

01:28:38.791 --> 01:28:43.791
And I will not allow another world
to fall in our name.

01:28:43.875 --> 01:28:45.041
[Devra sighs]

01:28:46.916 --> 01:28:48.583
And what of those you command?

01:28:51.541 --> 01:28:53.083
[Darrian] Their lives are theirs.

01:28:56.291 --> 01:28:57.500
[Devra] Hmm.

01:29:10.666 --> 01:29:14.250
These people, they've come to us with

01:29:15.041 --> 01:29:16.666
nowhere else to turn.

01:29:17.750 --> 01:29:18.958
They come…

01:29:19.625 --> 01:29:21.000
…seeking our help…

01:29:22.083 --> 01:29:25.500
…to stand against
a Dreadnought of the Motherworld.

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.125
Is that not what we stand for?

01:29:31.375 --> 01:29:34.708
Are they not who we once were?

01:29:39.250 --> 01:29:42.708
If we will not stand with these
defiant farmers to protect their home,

01:29:43.291 --> 01:29:45.750
then the revolution is meaningless.

01:29:47.791 --> 01:29:48.875
Under free will,

01:29:49.541 --> 01:29:52.916
who among you
is willing to die for what we believe

01:29:53.916 --> 01:29:55.708
rather than hide behind it?

01:30:12.125 --> 01:30:13.208
[Darrian] Milius.

01:30:14.541 --> 01:30:15.833
Why am I not surprised?

01:30:16.416 --> 01:30:20.541
Who is going to make sure
you'll return in one piece, if not me?

01:30:40.708 --> 01:30:43.375
Thank Levitica and leave this planet.

01:30:46.291 --> 01:30:48.125
[Kai pats on back]

01:30:48.208 --> 01:30:50.625
Sister, until we meet again.

01:30:54.083 --> 01:30:55.208
[Darrian whistles]

01:30:59.500 --> 01:31:01.375
Maybe this isn't suicide after all.

01:31:03.291 --> 01:31:05.291
[ship engines blast]

01:31:27.166 --> 01:31:28.833
Why would he agree to help you?

01:31:29.833 --> 01:31:33.041
Bloodaxe? You think they shouldn't?

01:31:35.666 --> 01:31:37.166
It just seems short-sighted.

01:31:39.250 --> 01:31:41.125
I mean, he weakens what little of

01:31:41.208 --> 01:31:43.583
whatever word
you wanna use for it there is…

01:31:44.375 --> 01:31:46.333
Resistance, insurgency.

01:31:47.291 --> 01:31:48.416
For what, Kora?

01:31:50.375 --> 01:31:52.708
The chance to get obliterated
by a Dreadnought?

01:31:53.250 --> 01:31:55.583
Guilt, it's a powerful thing.

01:31:56.291 --> 01:31:59.416
[Kai] Aye, guilt. The underbelly of honor.

01:32:00.708 --> 01:32:02.500
I think I might've had that once.

01:32:03.791 --> 01:32:04.791
Honor.

01:32:05.708 --> 01:32:06.958
Would you believe that?

01:32:08.875 --> 01:32:09.875
It's true.

01:32:11.958 --> 01:32:13.416
I mean, what do you figure?

01:32:14.458 --> 01:32:19.916
I got ten, fifteen more seasons at most,
before I steal from the wrong man.

01:32:20.500 --> 01:32:24.875
Get stabbed to death by some
dog-headed son of a bitch in a bar fight.

01:32:24.958 --> 01:32:25.958
[Kora chuckles]

01:32:27.500 --> 01:32:29.375
It's really your fault, anyway.

01:32:30.458 --> 01:32:32.708
Makin' me wanna be an honorable man.

01:32:33.625 --> 01:32:35.791
If you had more
resisting power to speak of,

01:32:35.875 --> 01:32:38.041
you wouldn't need me to join you so badly.

01:32:39.791 --> 01:32:41.416
You're willing to fight with us?

01:32:42.375 --> 01:32:43.541
Since you're beggin'.

01:32:44.791 --> 01:32:47.166
Kai, we're not.

01:32:47.791 --> 01:32:49.291
Well, since you're asking, then.

01:32:49.958 --> 01:32:51.208
If you'll allow me.

01:32:51.916 --> 01:32:52.916
Wow.

01:32:56.333 --> 01:32:57.791
There is one complication.

01:32:58.458 --> 01:33:00.041
The shite in the cargo hold.

01:33:00.833 --> 01:33:02.541
I got buyers waiting in Gondival.

01:33:03.041 --> 01:33:05.458
Aren't the kinds known for their patience.

01:33:05.541 --> 01:33:07.833
Might be wise
to sever my ties to life as a thief

01:33:07.916 --> 01:33:10.416
before we go
picking a fight with a Dreadnought.

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:14.166
Besides, you said yourself you need me.

01:33:16.125 --> 01:33:18.375
- I did not say that.
- I think you did.

01:33:18.458 --> 01:33:20.791
I'll set the course
and let 'em know we're on our way.

01:33:20.875 --> 01:33:23.291
Oh, shit, does that make me
one of the good guys?

01:33:23.375 --> 01:33:24.291
[Kora chuckles]

01:33:34.083 --> 01:33:35.083
[in English] Please!

01:33:36.541 --> 01:33:38.041
I've told you the truth.

01:33:39.625 --> 01:33:41.458
I have nothing more.

01:33:43.541 --> 01:33:44.583
[Noble] Right.

01:33:44.666 --> 01:33:45.958
[scoffs] The truth…

01:33:47.333 --> 01:33:50.166
…that you took them in,
known enemies of the Motherworld,

01:33:51.083 --> 01:33:53.958
mended their wounds,
repaired their broken ships,

01:33:54.041 --> 01:33:57.291
all out of your
moral code of honor and charity.

01:33:57.375 --> 01:34:02.666
Our civilization has lived
and thrived for 10,000 years

01:34:02.750 --> 01:34:07.750
with honor and charity
as its most valued tenets.

01:34:07.833 --> 01:34:10.541
Yes. Yes, honor and charity.

01:34:13.208 --> 01:34:14.208
Do you see that?

01:34:17.500 --> 01:34:19.416
That ship is named the King's Gaze.

01:34:20.208 --> 01:34:22.208
It was named to honor our slain father.

01:34:25.250 --> 01:34:26.166
So…

01:34:28.083 --> 01:34:29.416
honor I understand.

01:34:32.916 --> 01:34:34.208
Charity, I do not.

01:34:35.375 --> 01:34:38.375
Our King showed charity
to an off-worlder like yourself

01:34:38.458 --> 01:34:40.333
and was slaughtered for his charity.

01:34:41.041 --> 01:34:45.750
So, we named the ship to remind us
of the power in that benevolent gaze

01:34:45.833 --> 01:34:48.250
that was lost to charity.

01:34:49.583 --> 01:34:54.250
And to remember that, if by God's will,
that gaze should fall upon us and be held,

01:34:55.750 --> 01:34:57.458
for even the briefest of moments,

01:34:58.958 --> 01:35:00.958
it could change your life forever.

01:35:03.041 --> 01:35:04.541
Today, it falls upon you.

01:35:09.750 --> 01:35:12.500
[rousing choral anthem plays]

01:35:20.375 --> 01:35:22.166

- Confirmed.

[commander] Fire at will.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:34.750
[Cassius] Sir, we received a message
from one of our Hawkshaws.

01:35:35.458 --> 01:35:37.583
They're closing in on the Bloodaxes.

01:35:38.833 --> 01:35:39.708
[Noble] Ah.

01:35:40.875 --> 01:35:42.541
Finally, some good news.

01:35:43.666 --> 01:35:45.291
Well, prepare the hyperlaunch.

01:35:45.375 --> 01:35:48.500
I'll go ahead and personally retrieve
the treasonous dogs myself.

01:35:49.083 --> 01:35:51.083
[rousing choral anthem continues]

01:35:55.625 --> 01:35:57.708
And what orders for the King's Gaze, sir?

01:35:58.291 --> 01:36:00.333
Well, once you've razed the planet,

01:36:00.416 --> 01:36:04.291
we'll rendezvous, extract the exact
location of the rest of the insurgents,

01:36:04.875 --> 01:36:06.833
and destroy them once and for all.

01:36:06.916 --> 01:36:07.750
[Cassius] Yes, sir.

Kai said these boxes.

- [Titus] We've got one.
- [Gunnar] Okay.

01:37:04.583 --> 01:37:06.000
Aye, just take the gray ones.

01:37:06.083 --> 01:37:07.416
- They're all marked.
- All right.

01:37:07.500 --> 01:37:11.083
For God's sake, don't look inside.
I'd hate you to think less of me.

Where do you want them?

01:37:20.583 --> 01:37:22.875
- There's space behind the bridge.
- Done.

01:37:24.833 --> 01:37:26.833
All right, put them
the other side of the bridge.

01:37:29.875 --> 01:37:32.500
Aye, let's unload
and get off this godforsaken rock.

01:37:33.083 --> 01:37:34.958
I'll be happy to leave this life behind.

Good.

Once you tie off those ships,
see if you can get some fuel.

Everything is done.

- [Kai] All right, let's move.
- [Hawkshaw] Yes.

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:42.666
- [comms beeps]
- On your mark.

01:38:44.541 --> 01:38:45.666

[Kai] On Veldt, in Providence,
the first time I heard your story.

01:40:05.416 --> 01:40:09.500
Thought with your ideals of resistance
I could round up a couple of heads.

01:40:09.583 --> 01:40:11.333
Tarak for instance.

01:40:12.083 --> 01:40:13.916
His world enslaved.

01:40:15.166 --> 01:40:16.541
Then there was Nemesis.

Her whole family slaughtered.

01:40:20.666 --> 01:40:22.250
But General Titus?

01:40:23.291 --> 01:40:26.708
Have you any idea
how much he alone is worth?

01:40:27.916 --> 01:40:29.500
They would've all jumped at the chance

01:40:29.583 --> 01:40:31.916
to exact any small vengeance
against the Realm.

01:40:33.291 --> 01:40:35.875
Even if the payment
was only a sack of grain.

01:40:39.041 --> 01:40:42.291
Then there was you. Kora.

01:40:43.916 --> 01:40:46.125
Or should I call you Arthelais?

01:40:47.458 --> 01:40:49.583
The biggest prize of them all.

01:40:51.791 --> 01:40:54.291
Do you know what
the Motherworld did to my planet?

01:40:54.875 --> 01:40:57.000
They didn't just destroy it.

01:40:58.750 --> 01:41:02.166
They tortured every man, woman, and child.

01:41:04.041 --> 01:41:08.500
Left them clingin' to life
as they turned them to ash from low orbit.

01:41:10.250 --> 01:41:11.791
You know what that taught me?

01:41:13.250 --> 01:41:16.458
Never set foot
on the wrong side of history.

01:41:16.541 --> 01:41:18.500
[Kora] Is that what you think we're doing?

01:41:19.625 --> 01:41:20.583
[Kai] No.

01:41:20.666 --> 01:41:24.125
You've chosen the side that
doesn't even make it to the history books.

01:41:25.250 --> 01:41:26.750
What happened to honor?

01:41:27.375 --> 01:41:29.000
What did happen to it?

01:41:30.291 --> 01:41:31.666
Piece of shit.

01:41:39.666 --> 01:41:41.250
Well, who all have we got here?

01:41:44.083 --> 01:41:45.000
Who indeed?

01:41:46.791 --> 01:41:47.791
Commander Bloodaxe.

01:41:49.208 --> 01:41:50.583
Leader of the very insurgency

01:41:50.666 --> 01:41:54.000
the King's Gaze was sent to
this backwater of the galaxy to capture.

01:41:54.500 --> 01:41:56.833
He alone will secure
my seat in the Senate.

01:41:58.333 --> 01:42:02.458
I would be remiss if I failed to mention
we are in the presence of royalty.

01:42:03.541 --> 01:42:05.250
Tarak Decimus.

01:42:05.333 --> 01:42:08.125
Or should I say Prince Tarak? [scoffs]

01:42:09.208 --> 01:42:10.208
General Titus.

01:42:10.958 --> 01:42:12.708
Needs no introduction, does he?

01:42:12.791 --> 01:42:15.958
His actions
at the Battle of Sarawu precede him.

01:42:17.875 --> 01:42:19.000
The farmer.

01:42:21.541 --> 01:42:22.875
The ambitious farmer.

01:42:23.958 --> 01:42:26.333
I pride myself on never being surprised.

01:42:27.208 --> 01:42:28.375
And yet, here I am.

01:42:29.833 --> 01:42:33.458
I understand
why all of them are here… but you.

01:42:34.750 --> 01:42:39.250
What could you have possibly hoped to gain
by mounting such a… feeble stand?

01:42:40.291 --> 01:42:41.125
Tell me.

01:42:45.166 --> 01:42:46.416
Oh, yes.

01:42:53.833 --> 01:42:57.541
The legendary swordswoman
known only by the name of Nemesis.

01:42:58.916 --> 01:43:02.208
Assassinated 16 high-ranking
Imperial officers

01:43:02.291 --> 01:43:04.000
and their security details.

01:43:05.125 --> 01:43:08.916
All in a hunt
to avenge her slaughtered children.

01:43:09.833 --> 01:43:10.750
Oh…

01:43:31.708 --> 01:43:32.708
[Noble] Of course.

01:43:34.791 --> 01:43:35.958
[gun clatters]

01:43:36.708 --> 01:43:38.791
Now I thought I recognized
something in you,

01:43:39.500 --> 01:43:40.791
down in that filthy village.

01:43:41.458 --> 01:43:43.333
Out there,
amongst all those simple people,

01:43:45.208 --> 01:43:48.000
the most wanted fugitive
in the known universe.

01:43:50.083 --> 01:43:53.458
Scargiver. Arthelais.

01:43:54.083 --> 01:43:57.333
Do you know what you've
done for me, Arthelais, truly?

01:43:58.583 --> 01:44:00.250
Assembling yourself as such?

01:44:01.916 --> 01:44:04.166
When I lay your bodies
at the foot of the Regent,

01:44:04.833 --> 01:44:06.708
I'll be a hero of the Realm.

01:44:07.291 --> 01:44:09.291
They'll write songs
of my feats of courage.

01:44:10.500 --> 01:44:12.291
It's not like I didn't do all the work.

01:44:13.708 --> 01:44:15.416
Let's move this along, shall we?

01:44:15.500 --> 01:44:19.250
Let's transport them paralyzed,
in case anyone's feeling frisky.

01:44:20.541 --> 01:44:22.875
On your feet. I've got a job for you.

01:44:25.541 --> 01:44:27.750
Look… [grunts]
Okay, okay.

01:44:37.125 --> 01:44:38.416
[gun clicks]

01:44:38.500 --> 01:44:40.041
[Gunnar exclaims]

01:44:41.916 --> 01:44:45.250
You play your cards right, you at least
might make it out of this alive.

01:44:45.333 --> 01:44:46.625
You're sick.

01:44:46.708 --> 01:44:48.041
And you're a coward.

01:44:53.416 --> 01:44:55.583
[Kai] All you have to do
is pull the trigger.

01:44:57.833 --> 01:44:58.875
[Gunnar] I won't do it.

01:44:58.958 --> 01:45:00.208
[Kai] Yes, you will.

01:45:02.916 --> 01:45:05.916
You can do it. Just pull the trigger.

01:45:09.708 --> 01:45:11.375
[machinery clicks, crackles]

01:45:11.458 --> 01:45:13.583
[system beeps]

01:45:15.333 --> 01:45:18.166
- I know you're in love with her.
- [Gunnar sighs]

01:45:18.875 --> 01:45:19.916
Kora.

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.250
[Kora whimpers] Gunnar.

01:45:26.916 --> 01:45:28.125
I'm so sorry.

01:45:28.208 --> 01:45:29.291
You can do it.

01:45:31.875 --> 01:45:33.625
- [gun loads, fires]
- [Kora gasps]

01:45:36.750 --> 01:45:38.083
[gun powers up]

01:45:42.958 --> 01:45:44.250
[Hawkshaws scream]

01:45:49.375 --> 01:45:50.458
[Kora grunts]

01:46:01.250 --> 01:46:02.458
[yelling]

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:14.583
- [machinery clicks]
- [Nemesis grunts]

01:46:21.333 --> 01:46:22.375
[Hawkshaw yells]

01:46:28.291 --> 01:46:29.500
[Darrian grunts]

01:46:35.041 --> 01:46:36.500
- [Darrian grunts]
- [soldier yells]

01:46:36.583 --> 01:46:39.083
Pilots! To your ships!

01:46:58.083 --> 01:46:59.625
[system beeps]

01:47:03.416 --> 01:47:04.833
[TM87 battle rifle fires]

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:12.750
[scanner beeps]

01:47:15.333 --> 01:47:16.916
[pilot] Cut me loose! We gotta go!

01:47:18.625 --> 01:47:19.791
[system beeps]

01:47:22.291 --> 01:47:23.541
[screams]

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:33.000
[yelling]

01:47:34.166 --> 01:47:35.250
[grunts]

01:47:37.291 --> 01:47:38.500
[King's Gaze cranks]

01:47:41.458 --> 01:47:42.625
[grunts]

01:48:06.583 --> 01:48:08.416
[soldiers groan]

01:48:21.708 --> 01:48:22.833
[yells]

01:48:29.291 --> 01:48:30.958
[yelling]

01:49:12.291 --> 01:49:13.708
[alarm blares]

01:49:17.458 --> 01:49:19.625
[screaming] No!

01:49:20.625 --> 01:49:21.833
[yelling]

01:49:52.541 --> 01:49:53.916
[yells]

01:50:10.666 --> 01:50:12.208
[King's Gaze creaks]

01:50:19.750 --> 01:50:20.583
[yelling]

01:51:22.833 --> 01:51:23.666
[growls]

01:51:25.833 --> 01:51:27.833
[both grunt]

01:51:41.958 --> 01:51:43.291
[metal clangs]

01:51:43.375 --> 01:51:44.458
- [growls]
- [Kora gasps]

01:51:48.958 --> 01:51:50.625
[Kora groans]

01:51:50.708 --> 01:51:52.250
[Kora grunts, pants]

01:51:57.708 --> 01:51:59.083
[Kora yells]

01:52:07.166 --> 01:52:08.250
[yelps]

01:52:14.458 --> 01:52:15.708
[Kora grunts]

01:52:17.083 --> 01:52:18.500
- [grunts]
- [Noble yelps]

01:52:20.333 --> 01:52:21.333
[Kora grunts]

01:52:25.875 --> 01:52:26.750
[both grunt]

01:52:37.583 --> 01:52:39.166
[Kora yells]

01:52:40.041 --> 01:52:41.333
- [Kora grunts]
- [groans loudly]

01:52:45.916 --> 01:52:46.791
[bones crack]

01:52:46.875 --> 01:52:48.083
[Noble screams in pain]

01:52:50.541 --> 01:52:51.500
[Noble groans]

01:53:13.666 --> 01:53:14.750
[bones crack]

01:53:23.666 --> 01:53:25.041
[Kora pants]

01:53:38.208 --> 01:53:40.000
[Noble groans]

01:53:42.958 --> 01:53:45.041
[cackles]

01:53:46.916 --> 01:53:48.166
This is perfect.

01:54:01.208 --> 01:54:03.583
[haunting violin music plays]

01:54:13.875 --> 01:54:15.208
[distant explosion]

01:54:23.500 --> 01:54:25.375
[exhales deeply]

01:54:46.375 --> 01:54:47.958
They gave their lives for us.

01:54:52.416 --> 01:54:53.875
They believed in their cause.

01:54:56.416 --> 01:54:58.208
What better thing to die for?

01:55:01.541 --> 01:55:03.333
And I should have died with them.

01:55:06.958 --> 01:55:09.583
I know a thing or two about

01:55:09.666 --> 01:55:14.000
the guilt of carrying on when those
you've sworn to fight with are gone.

01:55:15.416 --> 01:55:16.416
Honor them.

01:55:17.958 --> 01:55:20.041
With everything that you can from now.

01:55:22.375 --> 01:55:23.333
Carry them.

01:55:32.416 --> 01:55:33.458
[Tarak shouts]

01:55:45.250 --> 01:55:46.375
[Gunnar grunts]

01:55:50.291 --> 01:55:54.291
This was a blow to the Motherworld,
what we did this day.

01:55:55.916 --> 01:56:00.291
Criminals, nobodies,
standing against a machine of war.

01:56:01.708 --> 01:56:05.875
This small act of defiance
gives voice to the voiceless.

01:56:06.666 --> 01:56:11.083
This is more than just a fallen
prick officer and some of his men.

01:56:11.791 --> 01:56:13.791
It's the beginning of something.

01:56:15.291 --> 01:56:16.458
What will they do now?

01:56:17.083 --> 01:56:20.000
The crews of the Imperium
are not known for their bravery.

01:56:21.125 --> 01:56:24.583
After the death of an admiral,
protocol will demand the ship's return.

01:56:24.666 --> 01:56:25.666
That's good.

01:56:26.666 --> 01:56:28.458
We still get paid, I presume?

01:56:29.291 --> 01:56:30.666
[Kora] A deal is a deal.

01:56:32.208 --> 01:56:33.875
Payment awaits us on Veldt.

01:56:37.416 --> 01:56:40.750
I owe you thanks, Gunnar.
You know, I never did trust that pilot.

01:56:41.583 --> 01:56:42.875
[Kora] We all owe him thanks.

01:56:44.708 --> 01:56:45.833
He saved us.

01:57:30.500 --> 01:57:32.375
[urakis bellow]

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:43.125
[Titus] I've been wondering.

01:57:43.875 --> 01:57:46.291
Is what that dead bounty hunter said true?

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:48.916
That you're Arthelais?

01:57:50.041 --> 01:57:53.208
Kai was a liar and a thief
who nearly sold you all for a profit.

01:57:54.708 --> 01:57:56.500
Anything more you want, General?

01:57:58.125 --> 01:57:59.250
Don't call me General.

01:58:00.625 --> 01:58:02.291
Hey, you see it?

01:58:03.666 --> 01:58:04.666
There.

01:58:08.375 --> 01:58:09.416
That's our village.

01:58:11.208 --> 01:58:12.083
Home.

01:58:12.583 --> 01:58:13.416
[Kora] Home.

01:58:14.375 --> 01:58:16.333
I never had a place to put to the word.

01:58:19.041 --> 01:58:21.875
It's almost a shame
you killed that son-of-a-bitch Noble

01:58:21.958 --> 01:58:23.333
and we don't have to fight.

01:58:25.833 --> 01:58:28.083
This would've been
a beautiful place to die.

01:58:36.958 --> 01:58:37.958
Yes, it would.

01:58:43.666 --> 01:58:44.666
Let's go.

01:59:13.750 --> 01:59:15.750
[dreadnought rumbles]

01:59:54.125 --> 01:59:56.208
[technician 1] Ready him for transmission.

01:59:56.291 --> 01:59:58.416
Balisarius is standing by.

01:59:59.833 --> 02:00:02.333
[technician 2] Sir,
should we stabilize him first?

02:00:02.833 --> 02:00:06.083
[technician 1] No,
we will not keep the Regent waiting.

02:00:14.708 --> 02:00:15.708
Neurolink.

02:00:18.958 --> 02:00:21.291
- [cable clicks]
- [technician 2] Link is established.

02:00:25.458 --> 02:00:26.750
[fluid gurgles]

02:00:37.291 --> 02:00:39.041
[technician1] Connection complete.

02:00:39.875 --> 02:00:41.125
Signal is strong.

02:00:53.208 --> 02:00:55.166
[astral energy pulses]

02:01:05.875 --> 02:01:06.916
[technician 1] Send him.

02:01:07.541 --> 02:01:08.833
[Neurolink powers up]

02:01:08.916 --> 02:01:10.208
[electricity crackles]

02:01:34.583 --> 02:01:36.458
[astral energy crepitates]

02:01:39.625 --> 02:01:40.625
Master.

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:43.125
Balisarius.

02:01:44.083 --> 02:01:45.541
I have found her.

02:01:46.791 --> 02:01:48.541
I have found Arthelais.

02:01:49.291 --> 02:01:50.625
The Scargiver.

02:01:52.208 --> 02:01:54.625
- You're certain it's her?
- I am, my Lord.

02:01:55.208 --> 02:01:58.541
She was in the company of the disgraced
General Titus and Darrian Bloodaxe.

02:01:59.291 --> 02:02:01.083
We are close to capturing them.

02:02:01.166 --> 02:02:06.333
Tell me, Commander. Did you think
that this would be good news?

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:08.958
That my daughter, Arthelais,

02:02:09.541 --> 02:02:12.041
one of the most dangerous
and decorated warriors

02:02:12.125 --> 02:02:17.750
in the history of armed conflict,
is now part of a blossoming insurgency?

02:02:19.083 --> 02:02:20.583
I'm supposed to be happy

02:02:20.666 --> 02:02:25.958
that she's joined forces with the genius
battlefield commander, General Titus?

02:02:28.416 --> 02:02:30.041
Sir, she is within our grasp.

02:02:32.125 --> 02:02:33.541
Let me bring you her head.

02:02:34.833 --> 02:02:36.083
- [royal staff thuds]
- [ice shatters]

02:02:36.166 --> 02:02:38.166
[energy crackles]

02:02:40.291 --> 02:02:43.750
[Balisarius] In truth, I fear the head
most endangered here is yours.

02:02:45.541 --> 02:02:49.500
You will crush this insurgency
to the last man, do you hear me?

02:02:50.875 --> 02:02:53.375
And then you will capture
my daughter alive

02:02:54.250 --> 02:02:56.833
and bring back my precious child to me.

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:03.208
So that I may crucify her
in the shadow of the Senate.

02:03:03.791 --> 02:03:05.541
If you cannot bring her to me,

02:03:07.083 --> 02:03:09.125
then the one whose public execution

02:03:09.208 --> 02:03:12.250
will send shivers
down the spines of the senators,

02:03:12.916 --> 02:03:17.083
and whose screams
will echo down its marbled halls

02:03:18.375 --> 02:03:19.541
will be yours.

02:03:21.583 --> 02:03:23.166
- [royal staff thuds]
- [energy pulses]

02:03:42.583 --> 02:03:44.083
[technician 1] Did he make it back?

02:03:44.166 --> 02:03:46.000
[technician 2] I don't know.

02:03:46.083 --> 02:03:48.166
I have no heartbeat or brain function.

02:03:48.750 --> 02:03:50.375
[technician 1] Hit him with everything.

02:03:50.458 --> 02:03:52.541
[Neurolink powers up]

02:03:53.291 --> 02:03:54.750
[electricity crackles]

02:03:57.083 --> 02:03:59.500
[rapid beeping]

02:04:00.416 --> 02:04:02.708
[screams]

02:04:13.125 --> 02:04:16.583
[rousing choral anthem plays]

02:04:48.416 --> 02:04:53.708
[sinister music plays]

02:06:02.625 --> 02:06:08.000
[haunting ethereal music plays]

02:09:20.541 --> 02:09:24.541
[haunting choral music plays]

02:10:47.625 --> 02:10:52.250
[rhythmic percussive music plays]

02:12:02.125 --> 02:12:07.041
[haunting folk music plays]

02:13:22.833 --> 02:13:26.833
[haunting folk music fades]
