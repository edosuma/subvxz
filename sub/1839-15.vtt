WEBVTT

00:07.133 --> 00:09.233
PRINCIPAL STUCKERMAN'S
AT IT AGAIN.

00:09.233 --> 00:11.233
JUST LOOK AT THESE
NEW RULES, CHELSE.

00:11.233 --> 00:13.834
I KNOW. "NO SPIKY HEELS,
NO SHINY HATS,

00:13.834 --> 00:17.500
NO NOISY JEWELRY."
WHAT IS THAT ALL ABOUT?

00:20.700 --> 00:22.100
HEY, Y'ALL!

00:22.100 --> 00:22.667
HEY!

00:22.667 --> 00:26.500
WELL, I THINK IT'S
PRETTY OBVIOUS WHO THESE RULES
ARE DIRECTED AT.

00:26.500 --> 00:31.300
YEAH, SO OBVIOUS.

00:31.300 --> 00:32.767
WHO?

00:32.767 --> 00:33.967
CHELSE, IT'S RAVEN.

00:33.967 --> 00:38.100
OK, YEESH. I THOUGHT
YOU SAID IT WAS OBVIOUS.

00:38.100 --> 00:40.133
CHECK IT OUT.

00:40.133 --> 00:43.500
[READS SIGN] WHAT?

00:43.500 --> 00:46.233
DR. STUCKERMAN
IS DEFINITELY OUT TO GET ME.

00:46.233 --> 00:49.133
OH, I DON'T KNOW WHY
HE IS ALWAYS TRIPPIN'.

00:49.133 --> 00:51.000
TRIPPIN', AM I?

00:51.000 --> 00:52.500
UM, MM, WOW.

00:52.500 --> 00:55.100
TRIPPIN' AS IN...COOL,

00:55.100 --> 00:57.200
UH, WISE, SMART.

00:57.200 --> 01:01.100
REALLY? WELL,
WHY DON'T WE LOOK IT UP

01:01.100 --> 01:03.500
IN MY POCKET<i>DICTIONARY</i>
<i>OF YOUTH SLANG?</i>

01:03.500 --> 01:05.300
YOU GOT ONE OF THOSE?
YEAH.

01:05.300 --> 01:08.367
HERE WE ARE.
TRIPPIN'--

01:08.367 --> 01:09.033
"SEE BUGGIN'."

01:09.033 --> 01:10.667
BUGGIN', BUGGIN'.
BUGGIN'.

01:10.667 --> 01:13.567
AH, BUGGIN'.
"SEE WHACK."
WHACK, WHACK.

01:13.567 --> 01:17.767
OK, OK, OK, OK. TRIPPIN' IS NOT
THAT GREAT OF A COMPLIMENT, OK.

01:17.767 --> 01:21.934
IT'S JUST THAT, THESE RULES,
THEY'RE SO UNREASONABLE.

01:21.934 --> 01:24.600
MISS BAXTER, EVERY RULE
HAS A REASON,

01:24.600 --> 01:27.033
AND EVERY REASON HAS A RULE.

01:27.033 --> 01:29.300
AND WHAT'S THE REASON
FOR THOSE?

01:29.300 --> 01:33.300
YOUR WARDROBE IS A DANGER
TO ME AND THE ENTIRE
STUDENT POPULATION.

01:33.300 --> 01:36.300
NOW REMOVE THOSE VIOLATIONS
AT ONCE.

01:36.300 --> 01:38.734
I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT THE BIG DEAL IS.

01:38.734 --> 01:42.200
NOT LIKE THESE BEADS
ARE GONNA HURT ANYBODY.

01:42.200 --> 01:47.367
MISS BAXTER, IT'S EXACTLY
THAT KIND OF NOISY--AAH!

01:49.000 --> 01:51.934
OH, SNAP. DR. STUCKERMAN,
I AM SO SORRY.

01:51.934 --> 01:54.700
OH, MY GOODNESS,
HOW'S YOUR BACK?

01:54.700 --> 01:57.100
WHACK.

02:55.100 --> 02:57.967
IF YOU THINK--
THANK YOU--

02:57.967 --> 03:02.033
THINK YOU'RE SORRY NOW,
WAIT'LL I DEAL WITH YOU
TOMORROW.

03:02.033 --> 03:04.033
OHH.

03:07.033 --> 03:09.300
MR. STUCKERMAN,
WE'LL SEE YA LATER.

03:09.300 --> 03:14.300
HAVE A GOOD TRIP.
SEE YA NEXT FALL.

03:15.300 --> 03:18.600
CHELSEA. I'M IN
ENOUGH TROUBLE.

03:18.600 --> 03:20.133
SO YOU THINK HE'S GONNA
SUSPEND YOU, RAE?

03:20.133 --> 03:23.000
WHAT? NO, HE CAN'T SUSPEND ME.
IT'S THE END OF THE SCHOOL YEAR.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.033
WE'RE SENIORS.
ALL THE SENIOR THINGS
ARE COMING UP,

03:26.033 --> 03:28.367
LIKE SENIOR CARNIVAL,
SENIOR PROM.

03:28.367 --> 03:30.133
SENIOR SURPRISE DAY.

03:30.133 --> 03:31.400
YOU CAN'T MISS ALL THAT.

03:31.400 --> 03:36.000
IT'LL
BE LIKE YOU WENT TO SCHOOL
ALL THOSE YEARS FOR NOTHING.

03:37.000 --> 03:41.200
AND SO TODAY, MAY 19TH,
I AM OFFICIALLY RETIRING.

03:41.200 --> 03:47.300
THIS WILL BE MY
FINAL DAY AS PRINCIPAL
OF BAYSIDE HIGH SCHOOL.

03:50.700 --> 03:53.200
WHAT'S TODAY'S DATE?
MAY 18TH.

03:53.200 --> 03:55.500
THAT MEANS THAT TOMORROW'S
MAY 19TH.

03:55.500 --> 03:57.900
NO, I THINK
IT'S A LEAP YEAR.

03:57.900 --> 04:00.700
ANYWAY, I HAD A VISION,
YOU GUYS.

04:00.700 --> 04:01.900
DR. STUCKERMAN
IS RETIRING TOMORROW.

04:01.900 --> 04:06.967
[SQUEALS] ALL I HAVE TO DO
IS AVOID HIM FOR ONE MORE DAY,
AND THEN I AM OFF THE HOOK!

04:06.967 --> 04:10.567
RAE, HOW ARE YOU
GONNA DO THAT?

04:16.200 --> 04:22.367
OOH...OOH...
OOH!

04:23.934 --> 04:28.367
DADDY...I'M SICK.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.100
UM, HONEY,
YOU DON'T LOOK SO GOOD.
I KNOW. I'M SICK.

04:33.100 --> 04:36.934
THAT DOESN'T PROVE ANYTHING.
SHE NEVER LOOKS GOOD.

04:36.934 --> 04:40.734
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU PAY FOR THAT,
BUT RIGHT NOW, I'M SO SICK.

04:40.734 --> 04:43.934
YOU KNOW WHAT? THERE IS
SOMETHING GOING AROUND.

04:43.934 --> 04:45.700
DAD, COME ON. YOU'RE NOT
FALLING FOR THIS, ARE YOU?

04:45.700 --> 04:49.967
SHE'S TRYING
TO DITCH SCHOOL.
I DID IT ALL LAST WE--

04:49.967 --> 04:52.200
WHAT?

04:54.200 --> 04:56.967
UM, MAYBE SHE CAUGHT
WHAT I HAD.

04:56.967 --> 04:59.500
UH-HUH. FEEL BETTER.

05:02.800 --> 05:05.000
ALL RIGHT, DAD,
WELL, AHEM,

05:05.000 --> 05:07.100
I'M OFF TO SCHOOL.

05:07.100 --> 05:08.700
UM, SWEETHEART,
YOU'RE NOT EVEN DRESSED.

05:08.700 --> 05:14.567
DAD, IT'S NOT
ABOUT THE OUTFITS, DAD
IT'S ABOUT THE EDUCATION.

05:14.567 --> 05:17.133
OK, OK, NOW I KNOW
YOU'RE REALLY SICK.

05:17.133 --> 05:18.834
LOOK, GO IN THE LIVING ROOM
AND LAY DOWN.

05:18.834 --> 05:21.734
I WILL FIX YOU SOMETHING
THAT WILL MAKE YOU
FEEL BETTER, OK?

05:21.734 --> 05:23.600
I FEEL BETTER ALREADY.

05:23.600 --> 05:24.767
I'M SORRY, HONEY. WHAT?

05:24.767 --> 05:28.667
I SAID, DAD, I FEEL
A LITTLE UNSTEADY.
I'M A LITTLE UNSTEADY.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.934
IT'S SO COLD.

05:39.800 --> 05:41.133
HEY, CHELSE.
I DON'T HAVE TO COME IN.

05:41.133 --> 05:44.934
YEAH, DAD TOTALLY BOUGHT IT.
IS STUCKERMAN BACK AT SCHOOL?

05:44.934 --> 05:46.500
YEAH. HE JUST MADE
AN ANNOUNCEMENT

05:46.500 --> 05:50.133
THAT HE'S MAKING
A BIGGER ANNOUNCEMENT
IN 20 MINUTES.

05:50.133 --> 05:51.100
OOH, THAT HAS TO BE
MY VISION.

05:51.100 --> 05:54.233
HE'S GONNA ANNOUNCE
HIS RETIREMENT, HE'S NOT
GONNA BE THERE TOMORROW,

05:54.233 --> 05:59.200
SO ALL I HAVE TO DO TODAY
IS CHILL--CHILLS, CHILLS.
OH, DADDY.

05:59.200 --> 06:00.300
OH, THE CHILLS.

06:00.300 --> 06:03.867
HEY, RAE, I GOT
JUST THE THING FOR YOU.

06:03.867 --> 06:06.200
OK, LOOK, YOU JUST
GOTTA BUNDLE UP.

06:06.200 --> 06:09.500
YOU GOTTA STAY WARM.
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT.

06:09.500 --> 06:10.467
I'M FREEZIN'.

06:10.467 --> 06:14.600
NOW, ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS FINISH THIS SOUP.

06:14.600 --> 06:15.300
WHAT? SOUP?

06:15.300 --> 06:17.767
MM-HMM. THIS IS
A SECRET FAMILY RECIPE.

06:17.767 --> 06:20.600
THIS IS GRANDMA BAXTER'S
3-ALARM COLD KILLER.

06:20.600 --> 06:24.767
MM-HMM, THIS'LL SWEAT OUT

06:24.767 --> 06:27.800
I DON'T THINK I NEED SOUP.

06:28.300 --> 06:29.467
MM-HMM.

07:10.133 --> 07:13.300

OPENED A WINDOW,
'CAUSE I'M GETTIN' COLD.

07:13.300 --> 07:18.200
REALLY? OH, NO.
I'M GONNA HAVE TO MAKE
ANOTHER BATCH.

07:18.200 --> 07:22.300
I'M GONNA
SKIP THE SECOND ALARM
AND GO RIGHT TO THE THIRD.

07:22.300 --> 07:25.834
LOOK, YOU STAY WARM

07:25.834 --> 07:26.734

09:57.367 --> 10:01.200
YOU'LL HAVE TO DEAL WITH ME
SOONER OR LATER.

10:01.200 --> 10:03.300
I PREFER LATER.

10:03.300 --> 10:06.767
OH, AN OLD SITCOM.

10:07.000 --> 10:11.200
<i>"OH, THAT RAVEN"?</i>
I DON'T REMEMBER THAT SHOW.

10:11.200 --> 10:15.367
RAVEN! HONEY,

10:15.367 --> 10:18.000
HOWDY, DEAR.

10:18.500 --> 10:20.734
HOW WAS WORK TODAY,
DARLING?

10:20.734 --> 10:21.867
OH, TERRIBLE.

10:21.867 --> 10:23.400
I'M A DOOR-TO-DOOR
DOOR SALESMAN.

10:23.400 --> 10:27.567
EVERY TIME I KNOCK ON A DOOR,
I REALIZE THEY DON'T NEED ONE.

10:27.567 --> 10:29.567
YAH!

10:30.667 --> 10:32.500
