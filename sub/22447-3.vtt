Andi:
Previously, on Andi Mack...

00:05.000 --> 00:06.250
I love basketball.

00:06.250 --> 00:08.380
Jefferson doesn't have
a girls' basketball team.

00:08.380 --> 00:09.920
Then I guess I have no choice.

00:09.920 --> 00:11.540
You seem nervous.
Are you nervous?

00:11.540 --> 00:14.380
I'm not gonna make the team
if I'm as good as the boys.

00:14.380 --> 00:15.540
I have to be better.

00:15.540 --> 00:17.080
Woo-hoo!

00:17.080 --> 00:18.540
Ooh, secret stash.

00:18.540 --> 00:19.920
Wait-- Andy, don't!

00:19.920 --> 00:22.080
This is that picture that you
ripped up and threw away

00:22.080 --> 00:24.080
because you said
he was nobody.

00:24.080 --> 00:27.290
-He's just--
-Don't say he's nobody!

00:27.290 --> 00:30.500
Is he the real reason
why you can't marry Bowie?

00:30.500 --> 00:31.460
Why here?

00:31.460 --> 00:33.620
Why does she have to
work here at The Spoon?

00:33.620 --> 00:36.750
My dad really doesn't want
anyone to know he lost his job.

00:36.750 --> 00:38.500

Hey, Amber.

00:55.670 --> 00:58.000
Get you started

00:58.000 --> 01:00.920
It's okay, I'll just wait
for Buffy and Cyrus.

01:02.080 --> 01:03.620
Whatcha readin'?

01:06.540 --> 01:10.580
I love that book. I cried
so hard when Cassie died.

01:10.580 --> 01:12.620
Wait, Cassie dies?

01:14.580 --> 01:16.210

01:16.210 --> 01:17.500
I have feelings.

01:17.500 --> 01:21.040
I'm sure you do.
I've just never seen them.

01:21.040 --> 01:23.580
You just have to get
to know me better.

01:23.580 --> 01:25.330
I have to?

01:27.460 --> 01:30.420
I'm sorry.
I-- I was just being funny.

01:33.500 --> 01:37.330

is trying to get your attention.

to be friends.

01:55.540 --> 01:58.380
Why would she ever
wanna be friends with me?

01:59.380 --> 02:01.080

About "nobody."

08:24.960 --> 08:26.670

08:34.420 --> 08:36.500

08:40.080 --> 08:42.790
Where is this coming from?

08:42.790 --> 08:45.080
Is he the reason
you can't move on?

08:45.080 --> 08:48.080
Oh, well, someone learned
all the buzz words today.

08:48.080 --> 08:51.580

we would have.

08:54.330 --> 08:57.830

I'm sorry.

you can't marry Bowie?

09:03.960 --> 09:05.120

09:05.120 --> 09:11.040

are... complicated.

09:11.040 --> 09:13.880

you could understand,

I couldn't explain it to you.

Well, can you at least tell me why he's

couldn't put him in my memory box... yet.

No, but I already love it.

12:12.250 --> 12:14.710
He got the snake
when it was just a baby.

12:14.710 --> 12:16.330
Raised it and played with it.

12:16.330 --> 12:18.290
Like it was a normal pet.

12:18.290 --> 12:19.790
He didn't keep it in a cage?

12:19.790 --> 12:22.420
-Can I finish the story?
-Please!

12:23.420 --> 12:25.960
One morning,
the guy wakes up.

12:25.960 --> 12:28.750
And the snake is lying next
to him, completely straight.

12:28.750 --> 12:32.750
Not moving. The guy pokes it a
few times, but nothing happens.

12:32.750 --> 12:35.880
He gets very sad because he's
sure his pet snake is dead.

12:35.880 --> 12:38.620
-I'm scared.
-Go on, go on!

12:38.620 --> 12:40.710
Calls his vet, tells him
what's going on.

12:40.710 --> 12:44.120
And the vet screams,
"Get out! Right now!

12:44.120 --> 12:47.580
The snake is measuring you
to see if it can eat you."

12:47.580 --> 12:49.170
Oh!

12:49.170 --> 12:53.170
As a herpetologist, I know that
that's not accurate reptile behavior,

12:53.170 --> 12:55.380
but as a lover
of stories, A-plus!

12:56.710 --> 12:58.250
What was the point
of that story?

13:00.250 --> 13:03.420
I think, you've got yourself
a pet snake.

13:09.120 --> 13:12.120
And she's measuring you.

13:14.380 --> 13:17.170
We need to find
a new hangout.

13:19.710 --> 13:21.670
Bye, Spoon.

13:29.540 --> 13:30.960
Thanks.

13:32.120 --> 13:33.500
Is it too salty?

13:33.500 --> 13:35.290
It's perfect.

13:35.290 --> 13:36.290
The movie?

13:36.290 --> 13:38.250
All cued up.

13:38.250 --> 13:41.210
-Better?
-Much.

13:41.210 --> 13:43.670
No we can really see
all the scales and teeth.

13:44.880 --> 13:46.880
-Ready?
-Mm-hm.

13:49.330 --> 13:51.250
(growling)

13:51.250 --> 13:53.120
Both:
Komodo dragon!

13:54.330 --> 13:55.670
Pit viper!

13:55.670 --> 13:56.790
What's he eating?

13:56.790 --> 13:59.120
Don't worry, it's just
a mere-cat.

13:59.120 --> 14:00.830
-(both giggle)
-You're so funny.

14:00.830 --> 14:03.330
TV Narrator: This is the
alligator snapping turtle.

14:03.330 --> 14:05.170
Ugh, I thought turtles
were cute.

14:05.170 --> 14:08.710
Its strong jaws can amputate body
organs, fingers and limbs...

14:08.710 --> 14:09.750
Should I turn it off?

14:09.750 --> 14:11.580
No, I'm having
so much fun.

14:11.580 --> 14:12.790
Aren't you?

14:12.790 --> 14:14.750
I sure am!

14:14.750 --> 14:17.830
Once the snake
has the prey in its mouth--

14:17.830 --> 14:20.290
But maybe
we can turn it down.

14:23.540 --> 14:25.210
Can I watch it from here?

14:25.210 --> 14:27.460
I feel safer.
Like you're protecting me.

14:27.460 --> 14:30.380
From these guys?
Not a chance.

14:30.380 --> 14:32.670
We would both be
so dead by now.

14:32.670 --> 14:33.960
I would miss you.

14:35.170 --> 14:37.080
I'd miss you, too.

14:50.380 --> 14:52.460
-I'm sorry.
-For what?

14:54.000 --> 14:57.290
That was--
That was terrible.

14:57.290 --> 14:58.750
It'll get better.

15:01.380 --> 15:03.460
No, it won't.

15:07.460 --> 15:12.120
I'm, um--
I'm gonna go.

15:12.120 --> 15:14.120
I'm sorry.

15:28.210 --> 15:31.330
These baby taters are awful.

15:31.330 --> 15:35.790
Don't call them baby taters.
That's an insult to baby taters.

15:35.790 --> 15:40.250
What a waste. I can't believe some
potato gave its life for this.

15:40.250 --> 15:42.080
Why did we come here, anyway?

15:42.080 --> 15:44.210
Because sometimes it's fun
to try a new place.

15:44.210 --> 15:46.460
And sometimes it's not.

15:46.460 --> 15:48.330
Let's just go back
to The Spoon.

15:54.290 --> 15:56.420
I get that you guys
are the Good Hair Crew,

15:56.420 --> 15:58.000
or-- whatever.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.210
-We're not the Good Hair Crew.
-You can join!

16:03.880 --> 16:06.380
What aren't you tellin' me?

16:06.380 --> 16:09.790
It's Amber. I don't wanna
be friends with her.

16:09.790 --> 16:11.380
Why not?

16:11.380 --> 16:15.380
Where should I start? Should it be
the time that she humiliated me

16:15.380 --> 16:16.580
in front of your locker?

16:16.580 --> 16:18.380
I forgot about that.

16:18.380 --> 16:20.920
Or the time that she
embarrassed you at your party?

16:20.920 --> 16:22.580
She felt bad about that.

16:22.580 --> 16:25.500
Plus, she cheated on you!

16:25.500 --> 16:27.290
Can of worms,
do not open.

16:27.290 --> 16:30.210
But mostly, it's that
I don't trust her.

16:30.210 --> 16:32.750
Why would she ever
want to be friends with me?

16:32.750 --> 16:35.290
I can only think
of one reason--

16:35.290 --> 16:36.750
I told her to.

16:36.750 --> 16:38.830
You?

16:38.830 --> 16:41.040
Why would you do that?

16:41.040 --> 16:43.080
Because she's goin' through
some hard stuff.

16:43.080 --> 16:44.460
What stuff?

16:44.460 --> 16:46.210
She asked me not to say.

16:46.210 --> 16:49.040
Mm-mm, that is not
how it works.

16:49.040 --> 16:52.670
You can't bring up a topic and
then say you can't talk about it.

16:52.670 --> 16:54.210
You say that like it's a rule.

16:54.210 --> 16:56.540
Because it is.
But it's our rule,

16:56.540 --> 16:58.670
and it doesn't apply
to everybody.

16:58.670 --> 17:00.330
It should.

17:00.330 --> 17:03.880
Let's just say that right now,
Amber could use some friends.

17:03.880 --> 17:07.330
I told her you guys were cool, but...
it's up to you.

17:12.250 --> 17:14.040
Barely halfway
through seventh grade,

17:14.040 --> 17:16.080
and Jonah Beck
is saying I'm cool.

17:16.080 --> 17:19.710
Jonah Beck is telling
other people I'm cool.

17:19.710 --> 17:23.830
He says that all the time,
about everybody.

17:23.830 --> 17:25.960
Please don't take this
away from me.

17:31.120 --> 17:32.960
Oh, how'd it go
with Iris last night?

17:32.960 --> 17:36.420
Bad. Really bad.
I don't wanna talk about it.

17:36.420 --> 17:39.250
-Okay... -We had our second kiss.
It wasn't really a kiss,

17:39.250 --> 17:40.710
it was some mutant form
of contact.

17:40.710 --> 17:42.210
I don't wanna talk about it.

17:42.210 --> 17:46.120
-Then we won't talk about it--
-But what does it mean?

17:46.120 --> 17:47.580
Are we talking about it?

17:47.580 --> 17:49.250
I don't know.

17:49.250 --> 17:52.080
Someday, I will have to talk to my
four shrink parents about this.

17:52.080 --> 17:53.920
Not today.

17:53.920 --> 17:57.170
So, when it happened,
what did you feel?

17:57.170 --> 17:58.580
What was going through
your mind?

17:58.580 --> 18:02.330
That I'd rather be watching a snake
eat an elephant than be doing this.

18:02.330 --> 18:03.830
Not a good sign, is it?

18:07.380 --> 18:09.580
Buffy, am I gonna be okay?

18:09.580 --> 18:13.080
Cyrus.
You already are okay.

Hi.

18:44.420 --> 18:46.250
Hey.

18:46.250 --> 18:47.920
Cleaning out your closet?

18:47.920 --> 18:48.960
Yep.

18:48.960 --> 18:50.250
Oh.

18:52.000 --> 18:55.250
So, you guys have found
a new hangout?

18:55.250 --> 18:56.830
What gives you that idea?

18:56.830 --> 19:00.460
Well, you haven't been to The
Spoon in a couple of days.

19:00.460 --> 19:01.960
And I got it out of Jonah.

19:01.960 --> 19:04.790
I never knew Jonah
had such a big mouth.

19:04.790 --> 19:06.750
Oh, yeah. If you don't
want him to say something.

19:06.750 --> 19:08.540
you have to be
very explicit.

19:08.540 --> 19:10.830
Thanks for the heads up.

19:10.830 --> 19:12.710
But the new place
isn't so good,

19:12.710 --> 19:14.750
so you'll be seeing us again.

19:14.750 --> 19:17.500
You don't have to sit
at my section.

19:17.500 --> 19:20.170
'Cause I'm not
a very good waitress.

19:26.540 --> 19:28.670
Are you selling this?

19:30.620 --> 19:31.960
How much?

19:31.960 --> 19:33.080
Five bucks?

19:33.080 --> 19:34.790
I'll take it.

19:34.790 --> 19:36.420
You don't have to do this.

19:36.420 --> 19:38.250
Please.
Are you kidding me?

19:38.250 --> 19:39.460
I love this shirt.

19:39.460 --> 19:41.460
This is a great shirt.

19:41.460 --> 19:42.580
Thanks.

20:03.710 --> 20:05.210
What?

20:05.210 --> 20:06.250
You busy?

20:06.250 --> 20:07.580
Not too.

20:07.580 --> 20:09.580
I need your help
with something.

20:09.580 --> 20:11.170
What?

20:13.290 --> 20:15.170
Closure.

20:15.170 --> 20:17.420
Yeah, let's do it.

20:17.420 --> 20:18.710
What's the process?

20:18.710 --> 20:22.380
Don't ask me. I tried ripping this
picture up, and throwing it away,

20:22.380 --> 20:23.750
and that didn't work.

20:23.750 --> 20:25.670
I'm hoping you have some ideas.

20:25.670 --> 20:27.500
Let me see.

20:31.380 --> 20:32.790
Tell me about him.

20:32.790 --> 20:35.330
His name was Gabriel.

20:35.330 --> 20:38.080
He was very funny,
very charming...

20:38.080 --> 20:39.540
very toxic.

20:39.540 --> 20:43.960
He was great at impressions. His best
one was that of a normal person.

20:43.960 --> 20:46.670
That sounds really messed up.

20:46.670 --> 20:47.670
It was.

20:47.670 --> 20:49.880
Took me a while
to see it, though.

20:49.880 --> 20:52.460
You asked me if he's the reason
why I can't marry Bowie.

20:54.620 --> 20:57.120
He's the reason why I'm afraid I
won't be able to marry anyone.

20:57.120 --> 20:58.670
Oh, come on!

20:58.670 --> 21:01.080
This guy?
What are you talking about?

21:01.080 --> 21:02.620
He's nothing special.

21:02.620 --> 21:06.170
You have a whole box
of ex-boyfriends.

21:06.170 --> 21:08.210
Yeah, but he doesn't belong
in there.

21:08.210 --> 21:09.710
Those are memories
I wanna keep.

21:09.710 --> 21:11.710
That's why I gave him
his own box.

21:11.710 --> 21:14.080
Which he doesn't deserve.

21:14.080 --> 21:15.620
He's "nobody."

21:15.620 --> 21:16.620
Remember?

21:19.710 --> 21:23.420
So, you need to put him
in his place.

21:23.420 --> 21:25.710
Ugh, I-- I can't.

21:27.750 --> 21:29.330
Relax.

21:29.330 --> 21:31.250
I'll be right next to you.

21:35.620 --> 21:38.710
You know, once you do this,
it's forever.

21:41.960 --> 21:47.420
Taped-together photo of Gabriel, I
commit you to the sea of ex-boyfriends.

21:55.960 --> 21:58.670
I've never done
a closure ceremony before.

21:58.670 --> 22:01.000
It was a beautiful service.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.960
I'm seriously glad
we did it.

22:02.960 --> 22:04.710
And I owe it all to you.

22:07.710 --> 22:09.170
Are you okay?

22:09.170 --> 22:10.750
Do you need a pizza?

22:10.750 --> 22:11.620
Always.

22:13.120 --> 22:16.170
Wait, did you put the picture
of Bowie back in there?

22:16.170 --> 22:19.750
Yes. But I can't open the box
till the next full moon.

22:22.710 --> 22:24.500
Here, I'll get it.

22:37.210 --> 22:38.750
Look at you two.

22:38.750 --> 22:41.580
You're so in love.

22:41.580 --> 22:45.120
This is
the most perfect picture ever.

22:45.120 --> 22:47.960
Am I ever gonna have this?

22:47.960 --> 22:50.580
Do you mean love
or the picture?

22:50.580 --> 22:52.790
Let's start with the picture.

22:52.790 --> 22:54.790
This belongs to both of us.

22:59.710 --> 23:04.290
♪ Keep me
close to your chest ♪

23:04.290 --> 23:08.960
♪ You are the more

23:13.750 --> 23:17.620
♪ You are the more
to my less ♪

23:19.920 --> 23:20.960
Andi:
Next, on Andi Mack...

23:20.960 --> 23:22.620
I'm doin' it!

23:22.620 --> 23:24.170
-Stop!
-I don't know how!

23:24.170 --> 23:25.210
Cyrus!

23:25.210 --> 23:27.210
Today's just a very hard day
for me.

23:27.210 --> 23:28.500
Today's the day when--

23:28.500 --> 23:29.960
You left home.

23:29.960 --> 23:32.210
So what actually happened?

23:32.210 --> 23:33.880
You wanna tell her?

23:33.880 --> 23:35.250
It's not my favorite story.

23:35.250 --> 23:37.120
-She should know.
-Know what?

23:37.120 --> 23:39.580
What is it, Ham? We're in
the middle of something.

23:39.580 --> 23:41.960
I think you left something
in the hallway by the coat rack?

23:44.670 --> 23:46.710
I made you leave.

23:46.710 --> 23:48.620
(drumbeats, bonk, thud)
