00:00.043 --> 00:02.915
Previously,
on "The Real Housewives
of Potomac"...

00:02.915 --> 00:05.005
I am not gonna walk away
from a half million dollars,

00:05.005 --> 00:07.007
which is what
the company owes me.

00:07.007 --> 00:08.443
So it's gonna get to be
a court case.

00:08.443 --> 00:09.574
Why are they acting
like this towards you?

00:09.574 --> 00:11.794
I have no idea.

00:11.794 --> 00:14.971
I'm inviting everyone
and their significant others.

00:14.971 --> 00:16.929
Have you guys heard
of pickleball?

00:16.929 --> 00:18.627
- I'm down.
- I'm down.
- All right.

00:18.627 --> 00:19.932
Don't get distracted.

00:19.932 --> 00:22.283
Today is about bringing
the girls together,

00:22.283 --> 00:23.849
team spirit.
- Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!

00:23.849 --> 00:25.460
You're on Gizelle
and Ashley's team.

00:25.460 --> 00:27.288
Oh, God.

00:27.288 --> 00:30.030
We all can have
fun together.

00:30.030 --> 00:31.248
You better
work that thing.

00:31.248 --> 00:32.380
Work that thing.
- That's right, Karen.

00:32.380 --> 00:34.643
And if it go left,
don't blame me.

00:34.643 --> 00:36.210
I don't know you.

00:36.210 --> 00:37.863
You know me enough to have
your mom threaten me, baby.

00:37.863 --> 00:39.082
You've been a hater
since day one.

00:39.082 --> 00:40.562
I hate on you for what?
You could never--

00:40.562 --> 00:42.651
You could never, my darling.
- For everything, baby.

00:42.651 --> 00:44.827
For everything, baby.

00:44.827 --> 00:46.742
And I'm aware of the
phone call that your mom made

00:46.742 --> 00:48.657
to my in-law saying that
she submitted my name

00:48.657 --> 00:51.094
to a shrine.

00:51.094 --> 00:52.965
- Shrine is voodoo.
- A shrine is like voodoo.

00:52.965 --> 00:54.402
- Oh!
- Oh! Oh!

00:54.402 --> 00:56.491
Oh, God.

00:56.491 --> 00:58.145
I got the
mother----ing bazooka.

00:58.145 --> 00:59.929
Come at me the again.

01:03.933 --> 01:06.022
I'm no angel
but give me some grace,

01:06.022 --> 01:08.938
and you'll learn to adore me.

01:08.938 --> 01:10.766
You don't have to
dig for gold

01:10.766 --> 01:13.029
when you shine this bright.

01:13.029 --> 01:15.162
I just took a DNA test,
and it turns out,

01:15.162 --> 01:17.729
I 100% don't care.

01:17.729 --> 01:22.952
When they go low,
â™ª I just hit high notes

01:22.952 --> 01:25.259
If you're gonna test
this professor,

01:25.259 --> 01:27.435
be prepared to fail.

01:27.435 --> 01:29.915
Nigeria raised me,
L.A. made me,

01:29.915 --> 01:32.179
and Potomac
will remember me.

01:32.179 --> 01:34.529
It doesn't matter
the size of our home.

01:34.529 --> 01:37.097
I'm always the queen
of this castle.

01:37.097 --> 01:38.446
I don't ride
the fence, honey.

01:38.446 --> 01:42.014
I am the fence.
You ride me.

01:57.073 --> 01:58.422
- Hi.
- How are you?

01:58.422 --> 01:59.858
I'm so good. I feel like
I walked into my home.

01:59.858 --> 02:01.164
Welcome home.

02:01.164 --> 02:02.644
Thank you.

02:02.644 --> 02:04.254
I feel like
I'm in Texas already--

02:04.254 --> 02:06.561
like, so many things.

02:11.566 --> 02:13.220
Hi.

02:13.220 --> 02:15.222
Oh, my gosh,
it smells so good in here.

02:15.222 --> 02:17.180
You look so cute.
- Yeah, girl, so do you.

02:17.180 --> 02:18.225
What is going on?

02:18.225 --> 02:19.791
Do we need bathing suits
in Austin?

02:19.791 --> 02:21.184
- You been to Texas?
- Well, yes,
I've been to Texas.

02:21.184 --> 02:24.187
I haven't been to Austin.
- Okay.

02:24.187 --> 02:26.102
I'm very excited to
invite the girls to Austin

02:26.102 --> 02:27.973
because it's so spunky.

02:27.973 --> 02:29.671
It's has its own flair.

02:29.671 --> 02:31.847
I think it's just a great place
to let your hair down.

02:31.847 --> 02:33.849
I mean, with a slogan like
"Keep Austin Weird,"

02:33.849 --> 02:35.416
I think it's
the perfect place

02:35.416 --> 02:37.809
for some of these
hoity-toity uptight ladies.

02:37.809 --> 02:40.116
I was really privileged
to host a drag show there

02:40.116 --> 02:42.205
a few months ago--
I had the time of my life,

02:42.205 --> 02:43.424
and I want the girls
to experience

02:43.424 --> 02:45.643
the city that
I love so much, too.

02:45.643 --> 02:47.471
If we are going to
go into this trip

02:47.471 --> 02:50.431
with negative energies,
it's not going to go well.

02:50.431 --> 02:51.997
Going on a trip
with these ladies

02:51.997 --> 02:54.609
is not number one on my list

02:54.609 --> 02:57.046
of things that I really
wanna do right now.

02:57.046 --> 02:59.701
Texas is a mess.

02:59.701 --> 03:00.658
Austin-- what's the--

03:00.658 --> 03:02.965
what the slogan?
Weird people?

03:02.965 --> 03:05.185
I can fellowship
with the people

03:05.185 --> 03:07.187
that I am in
a good place with.

03:07.187 --> 03:09.711
You know what?
Maybe we'll have some fun

03:09.711 --> 03:11.539
because I damn sure
ain't had no fun

03:11.539 --> 03:12.670
at pickleball.

03:12.670 --> 03:14.455
Maybe Ashley
will have better luck

03:14.455 --> 03:16.152
at hosting an event
for the girls.

03:16.152 --> 03:17.632
I know I tried.

03:17.632 --> 03:19.851
Uh, I'm there to help her
if she needs me. God knows.

03:30.993 --> 03:32.081
Hi, my people.

03:32.081 --> 03:33.691
- Hi.
- Hi. Welcome, welcome.

03:33.691 --> 03:35.432
- Hi, boo.
- It is, like, it's cold.

03:35.432 --> 03:36.607
It's cold and rainy.

03:36.607 --> 03:38.043
Why are you doing this to me?
- I know.

03:38.043 --> 03:39.958
So, what better way
to spend our time

03:39.958 --> 03:41.133
than to shop?
- It is cold.

03:41.133 --> 03:42.439
Okay, let's shop.

03:42.439 --> 03:43.614
'Cause Austin is gonna
be warm and beautiful.

03:43.614 --> 03:46.530
Oh, my gosh, this is--
Yes, tequila money.

03:46.530 --> 03:49.838
Is this-- are we staying
in a five-star hotel?

03:49.838 --> 03:51.143
What are the accommodations?

03:51.143 --> 03:52.101
Please don't tell me
we're sharing a house.

03:52.101 --> 03:53.189
No, we're gonna be
the city.

03:53.189 --> 03:54.277
So, yeah, we're
staying in a hotel.

03:54.277 --> 03:55.278
- Yay.
- Okay.

03:55.278 --> 03:56.888
What do we need
for Austin?

03:56.888 --> 04:00.240
Okay, so, you need to have
at least one swimwear article.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.328
I like this.

04:01.328 --> 04:02.416
I think that
a change of scenery

04:02.416 --> 04:03.591
is gonna be good
for everybody.

04:03.591 --> 04:05.070
Yeah. Are we gonna have
a drinking game?

04:05.070 --> 04:06.855
I like Karen liquored up.

04:06.855 --> 04:09.466
Karen has been on the
gin and juice all week, okay?

04:09.466 --> 04:11.381
No, she's been on
crack and juice, okay?

04:11.381 --> 04:13.122
- Yes.
- Crack and juice is right.

04:13.122 --> 04:15.690
She is
da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

04:15.690 --> 04:16.691
Oh, Karen, this is cute.
- This I wouldn't touch.

04:16.691 --> 04:18.214
This is my early bird cocktail.

04:18.214 --> 04:20.651
Ooh.

04:20.651 --> 04:22.087
Hello. Hello.

04:22.087 --> 04:24.264
Don't ask any questions.
It's my event.

04:24.264 --> 04:26.875
Y'all want me to go?
Y'all ready to play?

04:26.875 --> 04:28.616
I'm gonna have Mr. Pickle

04:28.616 --> 04:31.009
and Mrs. Pickle
lead us in prayer.

04:31.009 --> 04:32.489
I'm like, girl.

04:32.489 --> 04:34.970
Guys, we have things
to talk about.

04:34.970 --> 04:38.190
Do you think Nneka could be
lying about all that she said?

04:38.190 --> 04:39.235
'Cause it was a lot.

04:39.235 --> 04:40.497
It was a lot.
I know. I know.

04:40.497 --> 04:43.283
I feel like it is
a big accusation to say

04:43.283 --> 04:46.198
that a mother is praying
against an entire family,

04:46.198 --> 04:47.852
if it's not true.
- True.

04:47.852 --> 04:49.767
Like, and I don't feel like
Nneka would come to this group

04:49.767 --> 04:53.336
and make up that kinda lie.
- Agreed.

04:53.336 --> 04:55.512
The reason that I didn't
completely dismiss

04:55.512 --> 04:57.862
Nneka's accusation,
even when she made it,

04:57.862 --> 05:00.517
irrespective of the fact
that Wendy is my friend,

05:00.517 --> 05:03.085
is the way that Nneka
delivered this information.

05:03.085 --> 05:05.043
It felt like
with so much conviction.

05:05.043 --> 05:08.525
Everything conveyed that
she was speaking truthfully.

05:08.525 --> 05:10.962
That's a big reason that
I haven't really dismissed it

05:10.962 --> 05:15.576
altogether and just defaulted
to not believing her.

05:15.576 --> 05:17.621
For me, personally,
I was just shocked

05:17.621 --> 05:21.364
because Nneka knew that
prior to coming to my house.

05:21.364 --> 05:23.801
Wendy didn't say,
"Hey, girl, I know you already."

05:23.801 --> 05:25.629
Yeah, your mama
had been callin'...

05:25.629 --> 05:27.544
my-my mama, sister-in-laws.
- Yeah, all of the that.

05:27.544 --> 05:28.893
Wendy could have, like,
brought all that up.

05:28.893 --> 05:30.373
And your mama done
sent in the shrine,

05:30.373 --> 05:31.766
and I'm--
like, what the hell?

05:31.766 --> 05:32.810
Well, I don't think
she would have volunteered

05:32.810 --> 05:34.029
that information.
- I would have.

05:43.386 --> 05:44.735
Promise me
you're gonna relax today.

05:44.735 --> 05:46.041
- Okay.
- You're gonna relax.

05:46.041 --> 05:47.129
We're gonna eat,
drink, and relax.

05:47.129 --> 05:49.087
I know that's right.

05:49.087 --> 05:50.393
Thanks, babe.
- There you go.

05:50.393 --> 05:51.438
- Hi. How are you?
- Good afternoon. Welcome.

05:51.438 --> 05:54.092
For two?
- Yes. Thank you.

05:54.092 --> 05:55.267
Welcome to EDR.

05:55.267 --> 05:56.617
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

05:56.617 --> 05:57.879
My name is Ms. T,
and I'll be your waitress.

05:57.879 --> 06:01.143
I will go with the,
uh, pork belly sliders.

06:01.143 --> 06:02.710
- Alrighty.
- And the seabass.

06:02.710 --> 06:04.233
- All right.
- I'll take that, too.

06:04.233 --> 06:05.843
- All right, times two.
- Okay, yeah.

06:05.843 --> 06:07.671
All right, would y'all like
to order anything to drink?

06:07.671 --> 06:10.631
- Uh, old fashioned.
- Baby.

06:10.631 --> 06:12.459
It's 5 o'clock somewhere.
Chill out.

06:12.459 --> 06:14.156
- We need it.
- Yes, we do,

06:14.156 --> 06:16.419
especially after yesterday.

06:16.419 --> 06:18.378
Pickleball,
it was too much.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.554
I think Nneka's sole motive,

06:20.554 --> 06:22.817
is to attack me
within this group.

06:22.817 --> 06:27.865
The only time Nneka pipes up,
is if it involves Wendy Osefo.

06:27.865 --> 06:30.738
That was a time.
That was a time.

06:30.738 --> 06:32.827
Thank you.
- Oh, thank you so much.

06:32.827 --> 06:36.178
We had fun
until it just went left.

06:36.178 --> 06:37.658
How did it go left?

06:37.658 --> 06:39.747
'Cause I recall
talking to my man, G.

06:39.747 --> 06:42.532
Then, all of a sudden,
I start seeing furniture move.

06:42.532 --> 06:43.620
Ain't no furniture move.

06:43.620 --> 06:45.056
It looked like
it was moving.

06:45.056 --> 06:47.494
But this is
your second time

06:47.494 --> 06:49.583
meeting me within this group.
- Right.

06:49.583 --> 06:52.107
And you're calling me... bitch.

06:52.107 --> 06:53.369
So, clear it
the up.

06:53.369 --> 06:54.501
Your sister--
I'm clearing it up, bitch!

06:54.501 --> 06:55.284
What the
are you talking about?

06:55.284 --> 06:56.938
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.

06:56.938 --> 06:59.680
She said my mom called,
talking about her

06:59.680 --> 07:01.464
and said something
about a shrine.

07:01.464 --> 07:03.466
Mm-hmm.

07:03.466 --> 07:04.728
I was like, "Jamal,
they're talking about

07:04.728 --> 07:06.295
some demonic spirits
and praying."

07:06.295 --> 07:07.514
He said, "Gizelle,
that sh-- is real."

07:07.514 --> 07:08.645
- Yes, it is.
- It is.

07:08.645 --> 07:09.820
"And do not play with it."

07:09.820 --> 07:11.387
There's truth to what
Nneka was saying.

07:11.387 --> 07:12.606
I do feel there's truth.

07:12.606 --> 07:14.869
She's smart.
So, I like her.

07:14.869 --> 07:16.305
- Yeah, she's a lawyer.
- She's very smart.

07:16.305 --> 07:17.785
She's smart.

07:17.785 --> 07:19.177
She's not gonna make up
stupid stuff for no reason.

07:19.177 --> 07:22.529
So, I'm--
I, 100% believe Nneka.

07:22.529 --> 07:24.792
Oh, we gotta talk about Iyke. Whoa.

07:24.792 --> 07:26.315
Okay, Gizelle--

07:26.315 --> 07:28.056
- Did Eddie unfollow you.
- Yes.

07:28.056 --> 07:31.407
So, then Iyke said,
"Square up. Square up.

07:31.407 --> 07:33.801
"Let me know. Be a man."

07:33.801 --> 07:35.063
Okay, so,
you don't know me.

07:35.063 --> 07:36.281
Say it. Say it.

07:36.281 --> 07:37.413
I just met you
the other day.

07:37.413 --> 07:38.414
No, you gotta say it
with your chest.

07:38.414 --> 07:39.154
You don't know me,
right, bro?

07:39.154 --> 07:40.329
It's okay.

07:40.329 --> 07:41.504
I don't have problems
with anybody.

07:41.504 --> 07:42.636
I'm Happy Eddie.

07:42.636 --> 07:43.767
You are.

07:43.767 --> 07:44.855
I don't have problems
with nobody.

07:44.855 --> 07:46.509
This is the first time
I met this dude.

07:46.509 --> 07:48.206
We just figured out
we all went to College Park.

07:48.206 --> 07:50.208
Y'all went to College Park
but at different times.

07:50.208 --> 07:51.775
At different times,
so we're not even
in the same year.

07:51.775 --> 07:52.907
Oh.

08:02.046 --> 08:05.441
Um...

08:05.441 --> 08:09.053
it's a college campus.

08:09.053 --> 08:13.144
I don't know everybody
I went to college with.

08:13.144 --> 08:16.583
But, hey, it says a lot
that you remember my husband.

08:16.583 --> 08:17.975
You guys are going
to Austin.

08:17.975 --> 08:19.586
Since things are weird
between you and Nneka,

08:19.586 --> 08:22.632
how are y'all gonna
reconcile that?

08:22.632 --> 08:25.853
The fact that you're Igbo,
and I'm Igbo,

08:25.853 --> 08:28.551
and your agenda was
to attack your sister,

08:28.551 --> 08:29.944
she got a lotta
catching up to do.

08:29.944 --> 08:31.685
Right.

08:31.685 --> 08:33.295
I hate when people
are like, "Oh, you know,

08:33.295 --> 08:34.644
I don't know
what my mama doing."

08:34.644 --> 08:36.341
No, you know exactly
what your mother is doing.

08:36.341 --> 08:37.647
And, Eddie, you know exactly

08:37.647 --> 08:38.953
what Wendy is doing.
- Oh, I need to sit down.

08:38.953 --> 08:40.998
They're all working
together for-for evil.

08:40.998 --> 08:43.784
I'm not gonna go that far.

08:58.494 --> 08:59.669
Wait a minute.

08:59.669 --> 09:03.151
Let me just slip this up
real quick, babe.

09:03.151 --> 09:04.500
Are you trying to delay?

09:04.500 --> 09:05.632
No, there's
no delay, babe.

09:05.632 --> 09:06.894
I know you didn't
wanna come today.

09:06.894 --> 09:07.851
You're just-- every second
you can to delay.

09:07.851 --> 09:09.810
Hello.
- Good morning.

09:09.810 --> 09:10.985
Hi. Good morning.
Good morning.

09:10.985 --> 09:13.640
Um, I have an appointment
for 11:15.

09:13.640 --> 09:15.598
Go ahead and sign in
for me, please.

09:15.598 --> 09:17.208
I think my family,
from the beginning,

09:17.208 --> 09:19.820
has always pushed me getting
married and having kids

09:19.820 --> 09:21.648
because that's what
we do as a culture.

09:21.648 --> 09:23.519
Literally, like, as soon as
you get married,

09:23.519 --> 09:24.607
people are expecting you

09:24.607 --> 09:25.869
to turn up pregnant
within a year.

09:34.704 --> 09:36.053
I wasn't even trying
to get pregnant

09:36.053 --> 09:38.534
on my honeymoon or even
a year into our marriage.

09:38.534 --> 09:40.841
Our plan was just
enjoy life, travel,

09:40.841 --> 09:42.451
and then,
when we are ready,

09:42.451 --> 09:44.366
to just kinda segue
into parenthood.

09:44.366 --> 09:48.065
So, I think the fact that
I'm 35, and I'm now trying,

09:48.065 --> 09:50.720
and I'm having a delayed,
um, success,

09:50.720 --> 09:54.071
I think they're definitely
gonna think "Told you so."

09:54.071 --> 09:55.725
So, you'll be seeing
Dr. Moore today.

09:55.725 --> 09:57.074
He'll be in shortly, okay?

09:57.074 --> 09:58.728
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

09:58.728 --> 10:00.208
- Thanks.
- So, they're checking her.

10:00.208 --> 10:02.384
What about me?

10:02.384 --> 10:04.647
- Sorry. Excuse me.
- You didn't want to even
be here.

10:04.647 --> 10:06.214
You didn't wanna be here.
Now, you're here.

10:06.214 --> 10:07.868
You just wanna be on the--
do you wanna wear a gown, too?

10:07.868 --> 10:10.044
- No, I'm good.
- Okay, okay.

10:10.044 --> 10:11.654
How do you feel
about yesterday?

10:11.654 --> 10:13.003
That sh-- exhausted me.

10:13.003 --> 10:14.744
It's super annoying because...

10:14.744 --> 10:16.311
I thought it was gonna be
a really great day.

10:17.573 --> 10:19.227
After the pickleball event,

10:19.227 --> 10:21.795
I do feel horrible
that it came out that way.

10:21.795 --> 10:23.884
I'm aware of the phone call
that your mom made

10:23.884 --> 10:25.668
to my in-law, saying that
she submitted my name

10:25.668 --> 10:28.149
to a shrine.

10:28.149 --> 10:30.020
I wish I could've just
sat down with her privately,

10:30.020 --> 10:32.283
but people don't understand
that these shrines,

10:32.283 --> 10:34.895
in Nigeria,
are very real.

10:34.895 --> 10:37.941
The only reason someone
submits your name to a shrine,

10:37.941 --> 10:40.683
is for death
and destruction.

10:40.683 --> 10:42.685
I'm such an honest
and transparent person

10:42.685 --> 10:44.905
that the information
just flowed out naturally

10:44.905 --> 10:46.776
because I didn't
understand

10:46.776 --> 10:49.344
why she was continuing
to be fake.

10:49.344 --> 10:50.998
- How you doin', doc?
- How you doin', man? Javaka.

10:50.998 --> 10:52.695
- Ikenna.
- Nice to see you.

10:52.695 --> 10:53.870
What-what-what's
your first name?

10:53.870 --> 10:57.178
Ihim, Ikenna Ihim.

10:57.178 --> 10:58.832
What part of Nigeria
are you from?

10:58.832 --> 10:59.963
- Imo States.
- Yeah.

10:59.963 --> 11:01.225
You know, I've been there.

11:01.225 --> 11:02.618
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

11:02.618 --> 11:04.620
I went there,
like, 20 years ago.

11:04.620 --> 11:05.839
I went to
Howard University Hospital

11:05.839 --> 11:07.101
when I was a resident.

11:07.101 --> 11:08.537
That's cool.

11:08.537 --> 11:11.061
So, I looked over
all of your labs and everything.

11:11.061 --> 11:15.109
With infertility,
about 40% of infertile, um,

11:15.109 --> 11:18.199
situations is result of
the-the sperm itself.

11:18.199 --> 11:22.464
As far the sperm analysis
is concerned,

11:22.464 --> 11:25.380
it said you have low volume,

11:25.380 --> 11:28.296
but I'm not worried about that
in this case.

11:28.296 --> 11:29.819
I mean, you all are fine.

11:29.819 --> 11:32.735
We gotta do it more
regularly, you know.

11:32.735 --> 11:34.476
From what he is saying,
you know.

11:34.476 --> 11:35.695
You can't listen to him.

11:35.695 --> 11:36.826
He doesn't know
what he is talking about.

11:36.826 --> 11:38.001
Yes, I can.
That's why he is here.

11:38.001 --> 11:39.220
You know what I'm saying?

11:39.220 --> 11:40.525
He doesn't know
what he is talking about.

11:40.525 --> 11:41.962
We've been trying to conceive
for the past seven months.

11:41.962 --> 11:44.660
I've been diligently
tracking my cycle

11:44.660 --> 11:46.096
to know my most fertile days.

11:46.096 --> 11:48.098
I think it's been--
it's--

11:48.098 --> 11:50.535
we have not given it
enough attempts.

11:50.535 --> 11:53.103
That's what I think.
I think there is nothing wrong.

11:53.103 --> 11:54.844
I'm pretty sure my guys--
- He's gonna tell us what it is.

11:59.980 --> 12:03.244
You're with the king.

12:03.244 --> 12:05.681
You know, just, um,
continue to take

12:05.681 --> 12:07.161
your prenatal vitamins
every day.

12:07.161 --> 12:10.947
Give it another six months
at a minimum.

12:10.947 --> 12:12.949
You can have ten kids,
if you want.

12:12.949 --> 12:14.081
You know, I have--
- I mean,

12:14.081 --> 12:15.082
but I was supposed to
have had one.

12:15.082 --> 12:16.431
I've been trying
for seven months.

12:16.431 --> 12:18.868
Well, that's-that's
a normal amount of time.

12:18.868 --> 12:21.218
You know, Nigerians have
the highest rate of twins.

12:21.218 --> 12:22.611
- Of course.
- I'm telling, when I--

12:22.611 --> 12:24.482
when I have Nigerian patients,
like, infertility,

12:24.482 --> 12:26.006
I don't even worry about that.

12:26.006 --> 12:28.617
I know that Nigerians
are highly fertile people.

12:28.617 --> 12:30.184
We get multiples
by just blinking.

12:30.184 --> 12:32.142
But I don't want to wait
another six months.

12:32.142 --> 12:33.927
I want something
I can do today.

12:33.927 --> 12:36.146
I'm just not getting answers
that I want here.

12:36.146 --> 12:38.496
Thank you, Dr. Moore.
- No problem, guys.

12:38.496 --> 12:40.803
Nice to meet you.
- Thanks, doc.

12:49.681 --> 12:51.640
Baby, you have to trust me, okay?

12:51.640 --> 12:53.685
There's a reason
I make the big bucks.

12:53.685 --> 12:54.686
If you don't think
you need to be here,

12:54.686 --> 12:55.818
then keep quiet.

12:55.818 --> 12:57.080
I'm pretty sure
he's a professional.

12:57.080 --> 12:58.821
We know how--
- Okay, okay, stop talking.

12:58.821 --> 13:01.389
All right.

13:01.389 --> 13:02.825
Coming up next...

13:02.825 --> 13:04.305
Do you love Robyn?

13:04.305 --> 13:07.656
So, I cut the-the pie in half,
and I put the other half

13:07.656 --> 13:08.700
in the freezer.

13:08.700 --> 13:10.050
I don't know
how we got to pie.

13:10.050 --> 13:12.487
I don't put
the whole pie in my mouth.

13:12.487 --> 13:14.010
I go half a pie.

13:14.010 --> 13:15.316
I don't want you to put
any of the pie in your mouth.

13:27.894 --> 13:28.938
You're not letting me
open the door for you?

13:28.938 --> 13:30.244
- I got it.
- You always do that.

13:30.244 --> 13:32.376
- Hello. How are we doing?
- Hi. How are you?

13:32.376 --> 13:33.551
Here for your
10:00 appointment?

13:33.551 --> 13:34.639
- Yes, yes.
- Hi. Yes.

13:34.639 --> 13:36.554
All right.
I'll take you back here.

13:36.554 --> 13:37.904
Okay.

13:37.904 --> 13:39.166
You can have
a seat in there.

13:39.166 --> 13:41.603
Okay, thank you so much.

13:41.603 --> 13:43.648
I'm a little anxious.
- Why?

13:43.648 --> 13:46.738
You know, just things.

13:46.738 --> 13:48.697
I'm about to get my ass
tore up in here.

13:48.697 --> 13:50.090
- No, you're not.
- You sure?

13:50.090 --> 13:51.831
Yeah, 'cause,
you know, I'm perfect.

13:51.831 --> 13:54.268
No, I'm just kidding.
- Of course, sure.

13:54.268 --> 13:55.878
Good morning.
- Good morning. Hello.

13:55.878 --> 13:57.706
- Hi. How are you?
- How are you?

13:57.706 --> 13:58.707
Are we gonna hug?
Are we gonna hug?

13:58.707 --> 14:00.143
Yes, of course.
I'm a hugger.

14:00.143 --> 14:01.841
Nice to meet you.
- All right.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.103
Nice to meet you.
Hello, hello.

14:03.103 --> 14:05.845
Well, let's go on back, okay?
- All right.

14:07.281 --> 14:08.673
Have a seat.
Get comfortable.

14:08.673 --> 14:10.806
Thank you.
I love the water.

14:10.806 --> 14:11.894
Smells good, too.

14:11.894 --> 14:12.939
That means it's gonna be
a good day.

14:12.939 --> 14:14.027
I'm feeling--
I'm feeling it.

14:14.027 --> 14:16.029
There we go. There we go. Okay.

14:16.029 --> 14:19.380
So, first things first,
why are we here today?

14:19.380 --> 14:23.514
Um, we have recently
gone through a financial, uh,

14:23.514 --> 14:27.692
change with our business
and, um, having to downsize.

14:27.692 --> 14:28.824
Right.

14:28.824 --> 14:33.437
And having to, um,
navigate a lot.

14:33.437 --> 14:35.526
The relationship
between Gordon and I

14:35.526 --> 14:37.006
has definitely changed.

14:37.006 --> 14:38.529
I'll give you a call later
to confirm

14:38.529 --> 14:40.183
what we're gonna do tomorrow.
- Okay, babe.

14:40.183 --> 14:41.663
Yeah, it's a little tough
doing this

14:41.663 --> 14:43.970
when you're on the phone,
and Juju is doing her thing.

14:43.970 --> 14:45.101
It was a lot going on.

14:45.101 --> 14:45.885
So, I have another
call scheduled.

14:45.885 --> 14:47.060
Is that gonna bother you?

14:47.060 --> 14:49.366
Honey, don't get
defensive about it.

14:49.366 --> 14:53.109
Ever since Gordon was voted
out of the family business,

14:53.109 --> 14:55.633
he's been working a lot more
because we were

14:55.633 --> 14:58.898
expanding our portfolio
with other partnership groups.

14:58.898 --> 15:01.074
So, it is causing
a lot of tension

15:01.074 --> 15:03.163
inside of our marriage.

15:03.163 --> 15:06.470
And, to me, spending time
with the kids and having balance

15:06.470 --> 15:08.951
is so much better
than us always working,

15:08.951 --> 15:11.214
and then we look up,
and our kids are grown.

15:11.214 --> 15:15.088
So, things were
getting to a point where, um,

15:15.088 --> 15:19.396
I actually had, um,
retained a divorce attorney

15:19.396 --> 15:25.054
because I was going to be
filing for a divorce and--

15:25.054 --> 15:26.751
And I had no idea
it had gotten that bad with her.

15:26.751 --> 15:29.580
That's why I'm focused now
on really trying to listen.

15:29.580 --> 15:31.539
Well, let's dissect that
a little further.

15:31.539 --> 15:32.714
Mm-hmm.

15:32.714 --> 15:35.499
Why did you want
to file for divorce?

15:35.499 --> 15:38.981
Gordon was really
so focused on, like, work,

15:38.981 --> 15:42.158
and, you know,
and then we started to argue.

15:42.158 --> 15:46.597
And I grew up in a, um,
abusive environment.

15:46.597 --> 15:50.732
I told myself that
I just won't allow my children

15:50.732 --> 15:53.256
to hear mommy and
daddy arguing.

15:53.256 --> 15:57.043
Gordon had gotten to a point
where he wasn't listening to me,

15:57.043 --> 16:02.526
and I want Gordon to retire.

16:02.526 --> 16:03.658
Like you said yourself,

16:03.658 --> 16:06.922
you don't want to
miss out on these--

16:06.922 --> 16:08.924
a second chance
at being a great father,

16:08.924 --> 16:11.448
and you're a phenomenal father.
Do that.

16:11.448 --> 16:13.973
I set goals,
and then I don't let anything

16:13.973 --> 16:15.626
get in the way.
I go get it.

16:15.626 --> 16:18.281
I wanted to get to
a certain economic level.

16:18.281 --> 16:19.500
Okay.

16:19.500 --> 16:21.328
So that she and the kids
would be set,

16:21.328 --> 16:23.025
no matter what happened to me.

16:23.025 --> 16:26.420
I was almost there,
so I was really pushing hard

16:26.420 --> 16:28.857
to get those last,
uh, few nuggets.

16:28.857 --> 16:29.901
- Right.
- He was pushing a lot hard,

16:29.901 --> 16:31.512
very hard.

16:31.512 --> 16:33.427
He was applying it
to our shareholders

16:33.427 --> 16:35.037
inside of our company.
- Okay.

16:35.037 --> 16:38.780
And they eventually
voted him out.

16:38.780 --> 16:40.347
- Wow.
- Right.

16:40.347 --> 16:43.002
So, it's about to
get pretty ugly.

16:43.002 --> 16:44.655
We're filing a lawsuit.

16:44.655 --> 16:49.008
And so, there's another, like,
avenue of concern

16:49.008 --> 16:50.922
for me, as well.
- Mm-hmm.

16:50.922 --> 16:55.362
So, a couple months ago,
we had a sale, and we had--

16:55.362 --> 16:57.755
we retained an attorney
to manage the sale.

16:57.755 --> 16:58.974
Mm-hmm.

16:58.974 --> 17:02.021
The company sold,
and he ended up, uh,

17:02.021 --> 17:04.240
keeping some of the money
in escrow,

17:04.240 --> 17:06.851
is what he told us, right?
- Okay.

17:06.851 --> 17:09.419
And he said that he will
give it to us once every--

17:09.419 --> 17:11.465
all-all the paperwork
is finalized.

17:11.465 --> 17:12.770
Eventually, he stopped communicating.

17:12.770 --> 17:14.294
- Yeah.
- Okay.

17:14.294 --> 17:16.035
So, Gordon took a legal route
because it's a contract.

17:16.035 --> 17:17.340
He owes us money.

17:17.340 --> 17:19.908
He gets disbarred,
and then he commits suicide.

17:22.563 --> 17:25.479
And this is so fresh.
It's just been a couple weeks.

17:25.479 --> 17:28.482
And immediately,
I went to Gordon.

17:28.482 --> 17:33.052
Like, "Is your family
going to be okay?"

17:33.052 --> 17:35.184
If something happens to
your family members

17:35.184 --> 17:38.100
over some money, I don't--

17:38.100 --> 17:41.103
like, how do I explain that
to our kids?

17:41.103 --> 17:43.453
So, what I'm hearing is,
you are feeling betrayed

17:43.453 --> 17:45.064
on a lot of ends.
- Mm-hmm.

17:45.064 --> 17:48.415
Betrayed from the family,
as well as your nuclear family

17:48.415 --> 17:50.634
with your husband.
- Yeah.

17:50.634 --> 17:52.158
- And that's hard.
- Yeah, it is hard.

17:52.158 --> 17:53.550
Mm-hmm.
It is hard.

17:53.550 --> 17:55.030
Part of what she is saying
I think is what makes us

17:55.030 --> 17:56.205
a good couple.

17:56.205 --> 17:57.989
Having differences
in relationships,

17:57.989 --> 17:59.469
there's nothing with that.

17:59.469 --> 18:01.689
Mia is the sensitive one,
and I respect that about her

18:01.689 --> 18:03.212
and love that about her.

18:03.212 --> 18:05.301
No matter how her friends--
they treat her

18:05.301 --> 18:07.129
or other family members,

18:07.129 --> 18:09.000
she is always
concerned about them.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.264
But that doesn't
necessarily mean

18:11.264 --> 18:14.093
that it's a strength,
in her eyes.

18:14.093 --> 18:15.398
I'm not sure I understand
what you mean.

18:15.398 --> 18:19.750
Maybe she may see that
sometimes as a burden.

18:19.750 --> 18:22.492
I hope you hear this.
This is not about the money.

18:22.492 --> 18:24.407
But not doing anything,
is something that

18:24.407 --> 18:25.974
I personally wouldn't be able
to live with,

18:25.974 --> 18:29.064
and I don't think you
would want that.

18:29.064 --> 18:32.067
Okay.

18:32.067 --> 18:36.202
I honestly think that,
despite my feelings

18:36.202 --> 18:38.117
and how I feel about it
from a personal level,

18:38.117 --> 18:39.553
that Gordon is gonna go
full force

18:39.553 --> 18:44.123
on the business level,
no matter who-who they are,

18:44.123 --> 18:45.472
and I just don't agree with it.

18:45.472 --> 18:46.647
And it's, like,
- ing with me

18:46.647 --> 18:49.258
because it's not the guy
that I married.

18:49.258 --> 18:53.044
It seems like you both
have different ways

18:53.044 --> 18:56.135
of protection
in this situation.

18:56.135 --> 18:58.267
You the legal route,
and you wanted the family

18:58.267 --> 19:00.704
to remain together,
so your kids can grow up

19:00.704 --> 19:02.924
and know their nieces,
nephews, cousins,

19:02.924 --> 19:05.187
all that good stuff.
- Yeah.

19:05.187 --> 19:08.147
Have y'all ever just sat
and thought about that?

19:11.889 --> 19:13.282
Coming up...

19:13.282 --> 19:16.285
For the safety of me
and my children,

19:16.285 --> 19:20.550
I choose not to participate
in any capacity.

19:20.550 --> 19:22.857
She thinks that
if she doesn't speak to me,

19:22.857 --> 19:24.554
then I will disappear,

19:24.554 --> 19:26.861
but my black ass
is still sitting here.

19:40.309 --> 19:42.224
Ashley has invited
all of the ladies

19:42.224 --> 19:44.052
to Austin, Texas.

19:44.052 --> 19:46.837
You're going to Austin
to watch the drag queens.

19:46.837 --> 19:50.580
Yes, and, hopefully,
we all get along.

19:50.580 --> 19:53.017
The ladies have already been,
you know,

19:53.017 --> 19:55.542
having drama themselves. So...

19:55.542 --> 19:57.935
- Already?
- We'll see.

20:03.593 --> 20:06.553
Hi, Dais.
What are the babes doing?

20:06.553 --> 20:07.815
They're taking
a little nap.

20:07.815 --> 20:10.121
We're here at the park.
- Okay.

20:10.121 --> 20:11.688
I know that the kids
are gonna be

20:11.688 --> 20:14.082
at Michael's house at night,
but where-where will they be

20:14.082 --> 20:15.257
during the day?

20:15.257 --> 20:16.519
I feel like it's better
we just, like,

20:16.519 --> 20:19.305
stick to the routine,
come to your house.

20:19.305 --> 20:20.958
Yeah. I think
that's good, too,

20:20.958 --> 20:23.222
'cause, also, it gives Michael
a little bit of flexibility,

20:23.222 --> 20:25.485
as well, with his job.
- Okay.

20:25.485 --> 20:27.487
We're gonna hang out
at the park for a little bit.

20:27.487 --> 20:30.054
- Okay.
- Can you say bye to mama?

20:30.054 --> 20:31.795
- Bye.
- I love you.

20:31.795 --> 20:33.275
Bye, boobie.

20:36.626 --> 20:38.933
- Okay, you're 18 now.
- Yes.

20:38.933 --> 20:43.285
Are you able to be responsible
for your sisters?

20:43.285 --> 20:44.765
Yes.

20:44.765 --> 20:46.984
If they try to bring boys,
what are you gonna say?

20:46.984 --> 20:49.422
- It's not my business.
- No, no, no, no, no.

20:50.858 --> 20:53.034
You say,
"That's not a good idea," okay?

20:53.034 --> 20:54.688
Yeah.

21:16.405 --> 21:18.538
Austin, Texas--
I love Texas.

21:18.538 --> 21:20.670
This group of women,
they are unpredictable.

21:20.670 --> 21:22.803
So, I know, in Texas,
I'm gonna have a good time.

21:27.721 --> 21:29.331
I plan on
just dealing with Wendy

21:29.331 --> 21:30.680
the same way
I deal with everyone I know,

21:30.680 --> 21:32.639
with kindness and respect.

21:49.569 --> 21:51.484
I've decided to divvy up
the cars

21:51.484 --> 21:54.748
based on your astrological sign.

21:58.621 --> 22:00.536
- Come on in, baby girl.
- All right.

22:00.536 --> 22:02.582
We need some air on.
It's so hot in here.

22:02.582 --> 22:04.975
Wendy and I are air,
so we're the most mutable,

22:04.975 --> 22:06.455
so we can go anywhere.

22:08.501 --> 22:11.765
So, we're gonna do fire
in this car,

22:11.765 --> 22:15.377
and we'll do earth
in this car.

22:15.377 --> 22:16.552
Nneka, can you
get in the back

22:16.552 --> 22:19.076
'cause I-I get carsick?
I'm sorry. I do.

22:20.774 --> 22:23.603
I thought Ashley
was my friend.

22:23.603 --> 22:27.215
I don't know why Ashley has me
in this van with Candiace.

22:27.215 --> 22:30.566
Like, what is this?

22:30.566 --> 22:32.394
First word or phrase--
Robyn Dixon.

22:32.394 --> 22:34.004
Fraud.

22:34.004 --> 22:35.963
I hate that we're
not in a great place.

22:35.963 --> 22:37.704
It's very uncomfortable.

22:37.704 --> 22:40.402
I don't know how
to handle Robyn.

22:40.402 --> 22:42.404
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.

22:44.667 --> 22:46.147
Karen, you're dressed
to take over the world.

22:46.147 --> 22:47.235
I plan on doing it.

22:48.628 --> 22:50.499
- Seize the moment.
- It's my triple 20 this year.

22:50.499 --> 22:51.413
How do you feel
about that, Karen?

22:51.413 --> 22:52.283
- So funny.
- What?

22:52.283 --> 22:53.284
- Being 60.
- I love it.

22:53.284 --> 22:54.590
Yeah.

22:54.590 --> 22:55.983
You notice I-I don't
sweat the small stuff.

22:55.983 --> 22:57.506
Karen, when did you stop
sweating the small stuff

22:57.506 --> 22:59.116
'cause you were sweating
three days ago?

22:59.116 --> 23:00.117
I, really, I'm trying.
That's not sweating.

23:00.117 --> 23:01.380
That's speaking my mind.

23:01.380 --> 23:03.730
Robyn showed up.
- Stop saying my name.

23:03.730 --> 23:04.774
And that's
a beautiful thing,

23:04.774 --> 23:06.428
'cause she didn't
have to show up

23:06.428 --> 23:07.516
because we are not in
the best of places.

23:07.516 --> 23:09.083
What the hell?
Stop saying my name.

23:09.083 --> 23:10.301
- So, that shows-- this is my--
- I thought we were fine.

23:10.301 --> 23:12.521
Do you love Robyn?

23:12.521 --> 23:14.567
I'm not fake, Gizelle.
I like Robyn a lot.

23:14.567 --> 23:16.046
- You like her a lot.
- I-I wanna see her win. I do.

23:16.046 --> 23:17.526
Eventually, if that--
- You wanna see her win. Okay.

23:17.526 --> 23:18.353
Why don't you tell her?
Why don't you tell her that?

23:18.353 --> 23:19.615
No.

23:19.615 --> 23:22.662
I cut the pie in half
at-at your home, Ashley,

23:22.662 --> 23:25.142
and I put the other half
of it, my concerns,

23:25.142 --> 23:28.494
and which I will address
with Robyn directly, um,

23:28.494 --> 23:30.452
in the freezer.

23:30.452 --> 23:32.411
I don't know how
we got to pie.

23:32.411 --> 23:33.412
I'm gonna take it out
of the freezer

23:33.412 --> 23:34.630
because I'm ready
to just enjoy.

23:34.630 --> 23:35.762
Okay. Yes, take it
out of the freezer.

23:35.762 --> 23:36.589
Oh, you're talking
about a real pie.

23:36.589 --> 23:37.720
- I will. I will.
- Enjoy.

23:37.720 --> 23:39.635
It's a Karen-ism,
and a Karen-ism,

23:39.635 --> 23:41.985
if there's one thing it's
gonna do, is not make sense.

23:41.985 --> 23:43.422
So...

23:43.422 --> 23:44.553
- Is this apple?
- I don't--

23:44.553 --> 23:46.163
I don't put the whole pie
in my mouth.

23:46.163 --> 23:47.643
I go half of a pie.

23:47.643 --> 23:48.949
I don't want you to put
any of the pie in your mouth.

23:48.949 --> 23:50.341
Your business is
your business, but, Robyn,

23:50.341 --> 23:52.169
is she a liar?

23:52.169 --> 23:55.608
She will lie for Juan
all day, all night.

23:55.608 --> 23:58.001
Even on Sunday,
she'll lie.

23:58.001 --> 23:59.307
I don't know why.

23:59.307 --> 24:00.656
If she'd just come out
and tell me the truth,

24:00.656 --> 24:02.353
'cause she really wants
to be friends with me.

24:02.353 --> 24:03.659
I'm telling ya.
I'm real.

24:03.659 --> 24:05.705
I'm authentic.
I'm a ride or die.

24:05.705 --> 24:06.967
Look at Gizelle and I.

24:06.967 --> 24:08.969
We weathered the storm.
Keep on ticking.

24:15.236 --> 24:16.324
- Yes.
- Oh, this is Texas.

24:16.324 --> 24:17.151
The air feels
different out here.

24:17.151 --> 24:18.979
- Does it?
- Yeah.

24:18.979 --> 24:20.284
Oh!

24:20.284 --> 24:22.548
- Hello.
- Karen is out.

24:22.548 --> 24:25.507
- Very, very cute, Ashley.
- Cute, like, rustic.

24:25.507 --> 24:27.553
Yeah, you picked
a good one.

24:27.553 --> 24:29.946
Car number two is here.
Car number two is here.

24:29.946 --> 24:31.208
Do we have keys?
What are we doing?

24:31.208 --> 24:32.775
I have the keys,

24:32.775 --> 24:33.994
so we'll head on upstairs.
- Oh, we're checked in. Okay.

24:33.994 --> 24:36.213
- And we'll get our bevvies.
- Thank you.

24:36.213 --> 24:38.259
Okay, can we all fit in here?

24:38.259 --> 24:42.132
- Yes, we can.
- All right. Praise the Lord.

24:43.525 --> 24:45.309
- Oh, my God,
a hallway situation...
- Okay,

24:45.309 --> 24:47.311
Nice. This is nice. Ahh!

24:47.311 --> 24:51.011
- Oh, my God! It's so beautiful!
- Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

24:51.011 --> 24:55.842
Oh, look at this, Ashley.

24:55.842 --> 24:57.278
- Oh, yes, yes.
- Okay.

24:57.278 --> 24:59.585
Okay, boo.
There's cake?

24:59.585 --> 25:01.935
- Oh, there's tacos!
- Wonderful.

25:01.935 --> 25:03.240
Yes.

25:03.240 --> 25:05.852
So, Ashley, is my room
gonna look like this?

25:05.852 --> 25:07.157
Or all the rooms
look like this?

25:07.157 --> 25:08.158
All of our rooms are
gonna look like this,

25:08.158 --> 25:09.638
though, right?
- They're nice.

25:09.638 --> 25:10.813
- What does that mean?
- See, that's a-- that's a no.

25:10.813 --> 25:11.422
- Is that a no?
- Have you seen them?

25:11.422 --> 25:12.511
That's-that's a no.

25:13.729 --> 25:16.079
Robyn, you're also
in a penthouse room.

25:16.079 --> 25:17.385
Oh!

25:17.385 --> 25:18.734
Yeah.

25:18.734 --> 25:21.607
Um, we know that you've
been under some stress.

25:21.607 --> 25:22.782
Is that why she
gets a better room?

25:22.782 --> 25:24.914
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

25:24.914 --> 25:27.613
I'd rather sleep in
my little bitty cubbyhole

25:27.613 --> 25:30.746
of a room and be happy there
than be in a suite

25:30.746 --> 25:32.574
knowing I don't deserve it.

25:34.141 --> 25:35.664
I thought I was gonna be on
this floor wit' you, Ashley.

25:35.664 --> 25:37.100
I'm feeling a certain way.

25:37.100 --> 25:40.060
Are you being honest?
Has it been Robyn?

25:40.060 --> 25:42.453
Everybody knows I have
this visual this year.

25:42.453 --> 25:44.412
I'm doing pie.

25:46.762 --> 25:48.111
Where Robyn and I
are concerned,

25:48.111 --> 25:49.765
not everyone agrees with it,
but I do it. So...

25:49.765 --> 25:52.289
No, everyone does
not have this visual.

25:52.289 --> 25:53.900
- Explain this stupid-ass pie.
- So, anyway, no, okay.

25:53.900 --> 25:55.510
No, it's not a
stupid-ass pie.

25:55.510 --> 25:56.903
Wait, I'm not
aware of this pie.

25:56.903 --> 25:59.645
So, with Robyn, I cut
the pie in half mentally,

25:59.645 --> 26:01.168
and put it in the freezer.

26:01.168 --> 26:02.604
So, half of the pie is still
in the freezer with Robyn.

26:02.604 --> 26:04.127
She is saying half of you,
how she feels about you,

26:04.127 --> 26:05.346
is in the freezer.

26:05.346 --> 26:05.955
I don't know what
she's talking about.

26:05.955 --> 26:07.391
It's not moldy.

26:07.391 --> 26:08.567
I thought y'all
squashed it.

26:08.567 --> 26:09.524
Exactly.
I'm, like, I don't--

26:09.524 --> 26:10.656
No, ma'am.
It's not over.

26:10.656 --> 26:11.787
No, ma'am.
- It's not over. Okay.

26:11.787 --> 26:13.354
- It's not over.
- It's not over. Okay.

26:13.354 --> 26:15.617
I realize my half of the pie
that's in the refrigerator

26:15.617 --> 26:17.793
got two pieces now.

26:17.793 --> 26:19.099
Uh, yeah, I cut it in half.

26:19.099 --> 26:20.622
I cut it in half,
right now.

26:20.622 --> 26:22.581
We're down to one half
of the half

26:22.581 --> 26:23.451
in the freezer.
- Where is it?

26:23.451 --> 26:24.495
That would be a quarter.

26:25.888 --> 26:28.587
I liken Robyn
to a damn pie.

26:28.587 --> 26:30.763
I bought it from
Safeway, $2.

26:30.763 --> 26:34.070
Withholding information,
omission of truth, is a lie.

26:34.070 --> 26:36.420
Robyn's ass, uh,
she's on freeze.

26:36.420 --> 26:38.945
I'm gonna unthaw that pie
when you tell the truth

26:38.945 --> 26:40.555
and confess your sins.

26:40.555 --> 26:41.817
We talked about
this at pickleball.

26:41.817 --> 26:44.298
Karen can take her
one quarter of a pie

26:44.298 --> 26:46.822
and shove it up her ass.

26:46.822 --> 26:48.215
- One-fourth.
- Just a quarter-- a quarter.

26:48.215 --> 26:50.521
A quarter, one quarter.
Lucky I put you in there.

26:54.264 --> 26:56.397
Coming up next...

26:56.397 --> 26:59.269
"Holy Ghost fire on me
and Peter and thunderstorm.

26:59.269 --> 27:00.227
"Amen."

27:00.227 --> 27:03.839
There is no
witchcraft there.

27:03.839 --> 27:06.886
Holy Ghost fire
and thunderous what?

27:06.886 --> 27:08.583
This really doesn't
help her case.

27:16.373 --> 27:19.246
And what are we
going to be doing today?

27:19.246 --> 27:20.639
We're just gonna go to
the pool for a little today.

27:20.639 --> 27:21.901
- Okay.
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

27:21.901 --> 27:22.728
And then we'll have
some dinner tonight.

27:22.728 --> 27:24.164
- Very nice.
- Okay.

27:24.164 --> 27:26.383
Do you guys wanna disperse
and go to our rooms and--

27:26.383 --> 27:27.428
- Yes.
- Yeah.

27:27.428 --> 27:28.951
All right.
Let me get my stuff.

27:28.951 --> 27:31.040
- All right. I can't wait.
- All right. Thank you, Ash.

27:34.740 --> 27:37.264
It's not a penthouse,
but I will take it.

27:38.918 --> 27:41.485
Oh, my gosh,
a little gift bag.

27:41.485 --> 27:43.444
This is nice.

27:43.444 --> 27:46.752
I'm in the penthouse.
Ooh, I have a piano.

27:46.752 --> 27:49.145
Oh, this is cute.

27:52.540 --> 27:53.846
Construction.

27:53.846 --> 27:57.458
Oh, a lovely
construction zone.

27:57.458 --> 27:59.112
All right, Austin.

28:02.724 --> 28:04.900
- Girl, the sun.
- It's warm out here.

28:04.900 --> 28:06.859
Hold on.
Let's tippy-toe.

28:06.859 --> 28:09.078
Ooh, the shade.

28:09.078 --> 28:11.254
- Lovely.
- Lovely.

28:11.254 --> 28:13.779
Ashley did pretty good.
- This is cute.

28:13.779 --> 28:14.954
I'm okay with it.
I'm okay with it.

28:14.954 --> 28:16.303
Ashley did really,
really good.

28:16.303 --> 28:17.783
- Yes.
- Do you like your rooms?

28:17.783 --> 28:18.827
- Yeah.
- I do.

28:18.827 --> 28:20.046
Okay.

28:20.046 --> 28:21.612
There's a lot of
construction, though.

28:21.612 --> 28:22.526
I know. I was gonna say,
I'm looking at a lot of dirt.

28:22.526 --> 28:24.050
What?
What happened now?

28:24.050 --> 28:25.399
A lot of dirt plots.

28:25.399 --> 28:28.532
- Okay, in the room?
- No, out the window. Yes.

28:28.532 --> 28:30.143
I-I kept the window pulled
because I'm trying

28:30.143 --> 28:33.886
to give it an opportunity
to give it good ratings.

28:33.886 --> 28:35.235
Oh, Lord.

28:35.235 --> 28:36.149
- Okay, well, how are you doing?
- How are you?

28:36.149 --> 28:39.500
Because you-you
seem fine.

28:39.500 --> 28:40.980
I-I am good.

28:40.980 --> 28:43.722
What's the latest with you
and-and Miss Nneka-Nneka?

28:43.722 --> 28:45.027
You know what?
To be honest,

28:45.027 --> 28:46.463
I don't feel like I have
to say anything else.

28:46.463 --> 28:49.423
I don't know Nneka from
a can of paint, you know.

28:49.423 --> 28:50.859
Mm-hmm.

28:50.859 --> 28:53.383
I have no vested relationship
or interest there.

28:55.995 --> 28:57.126
- Hi.
- How are you?

28:57.126 --> 28:59.085
- Our host has shown up.
- Good, good.

28:59.085 --> 29:00.303
- How are you doing?
- Oh, my God.

29:00.303 --> 29:02.349
- This is very beautiful.
- You did well.

29:02.349 --> 29:04.177
- Hi. How are you?
- Hi, ladies.

29:04.177 --> 29:05.352
Sorry to interrupt you guys.
- Hi.

29:05.352 --> 29:06.135
- How are we doing today?
- We're so good.

29:06.135 --> 29:07.354
- Good.
- We are good.

29:07.354 --> 29:08.572
Wonderful.

29:08.572 --> 29:11.401
- We're feeling like tequila.
- Tequila!

29:11.401 --> 29:12.707
You know what?

29:12.707 --> 29:13.926
That's what you should
so when you're in Texas.

29:13.926 --> 29:15.144
- Okay. Yes.
- Tequila is the way to go.

29:15.144 --> 29:16.580
Well, we're feeling
like a peach fuzz.

29:16.580 --> 29:18.539
- Okay, peach fuzz. Peach fuzz?
- Peach fuzz.

29:18.539 --> 29:19.758
Okay. Y'all let me know
if you need anything else, okay?

29:19.758 --> 29:20.584
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

29:20.584 --> 29:22.630
Yes, thank you.

29:22.630 --> 29:24.197
- Hi, hi, hi.
- Hi.

29:24.197 --> 29:26.373
- Hello, ladies.
- Have we ordered food
and stuff?

29:26.373 --> 29:28.505
- Some drink and such.
- We just ordered cocktails.

29:28.505 --> 29:30.377
- You ordered some cocktails.
- Yes, we did.

29:30.377 --> 29:33.162
Nice.

29:33.162 --> 29:35.034
Okay. So, is this Texas?

29:35.034 --> 29:36.383
- It is.
- Okay.

29:36.383 --> 29:38.777
- It's quirky.
- Quirky or weird?

29:38.777 --> 29:40.169
- Okay, weird. Yeah.
- Yeah.

29:40.169 --> 29:41.388
Did you talk to
the girls? Check in?

29:41.388 --> 29:42.868
I did. I talked, yeah,
I talked to Grace.

29:42.868 --> 29:44.434
She's home, chilling.

29:44.434 --> 29:46.132
Nice. That what happens
when you're young.

29:46.132 --> 29:47.742
- Yeah.
- Where is Mia?

29:47.742 --> 29:49.048
Mia is-- um,
they're coming.

29:49.048 --> 29:50.832
Her and Robyn
were chatting.

29:50.832 --> 29:52.399
Well, I'm gonna switch
gears here a minute.

29:52.399 --> 29:55.054
As a group collectively,
if we're gonna move together,

29:55.054 --> 29:57.317
and-and move on--
- Yeah.

29:57.317 --> 29:59.058
I can't ignore
the elephant in the room

29:59.058 --> 30:00.494
between you and Candiace.

30:00.494 --> 30:03.192
And I feel like that
when Candiace is in the room,

30:03.192 --> 30:05.107
you're much quieter.
- I'm totally fine.

30:05.107 --> 30:06.848
I'm totally fine.
- There's really nothing
to face.

30:06.848 --> 30:08.284
- Oh.
- For--

30:08.284 --> 30:09.372
- I mean, there is-there is--
- Okay, here we go.

30:09.372 --> 30:12.071
She does not want
to acknowledge me

30:12.071 --> 30:14.638
because she thinks that if
she doesn't speak to me,

30:14.638 --> 30:16.249
then I will disappear,

30:16.249 --> 30:18.729
but my Black ass is
still sitting here.

30:18.729 --> 30:20.253
So, there's that.

30:21.645 --> 30:23.212
I haven't said that.

30:23.212 --> 30:24.997
For my mental space,

30:24.997 --> 30:28.261
and for the safety of me
and my children,

30:28.261 --> 30:33.266
I choose not to participate
in any capacity.

30:33.266 --> 30:36.095
But I believe it was
my bonus children

30:36.095 --> 30:40.186
and my husband whose safety,
and reputation,

30:40.186 --> 30:44.190
and just overall
mental state

30:44.190 --> 30:48.368
were in disarray because of
the things that she was saying.

30:48.368 --> 30:50.979
The end.

30:50.979 --> 30:55.679
You cannot make up lies
about any person

30:55.679 --> 30:59.118
and expect not to get
your ass handed to you.

30:59.118 --> 31:01.120
There was a situation
in which Chris

31:01.120 --> 31:02.948
made me feel uncomfortable.

31:02.948 --> 31:04.297
Like, I don't wanna
be in this situation.

31:04.297 --> 31:05.602
So, did he do something?

31:05.602 --> 31:07.822
Did he say something?
- No, no, he didn't.

31:07.822 --> 31:09.476
Right, 'cause he
wouldn't do that.

31:09.476 --> 31:11.043
Yeah.

31:11.043 --> 31:14.698
You sit up here with
your privileged,
white-looking ass,

31:14.698 --> 31:15.874
and you think
you can say

31:15.874 --> 31:17.266
whatever the
you wanna say,

31:17.266 --> 31:18.441
and no one is going
to bat an eyelash.

31:18.441 --> 31:21.314
Okay, wait a minute.
Wait, wait, wait.

31:21.314 --> 31:23.142
Candiace, last year,
I told you your husband

31:23.142 --> 31:25.274
made me feel uncomfortable
because he made me

31:25.274 --> 31:27.624
go into a bedroom
and close the door.

31:27.624 --> 31:29.148
That is what happened.

31:29.148 --> 31:31.802
Candiace has said
way too much

31:31.802 --> 31:34.327
negative, nasty,
horrible things

31:34.327 --> 31:38.026
that have directly
affected my family.

31:38.026 --> 31:41.247
There's nothing good
will ever come

31:41.247 --> 31:44.163
from me speaking
to Candiace.

31:44.163 --> 31:45.860
Tension is just thick.

31:45.860 --> 31:48.907
You know,
it does bother me.

31:48.907 --> 31:51.344
It shouldn't.

31:51.344 --> 31:52.954
Karen, right now,
you and I are in a good place,

31:52.954 --> 31:55.043
and I like it.
- I-I do, too.

31:55.043 --> 31:57.176
I do, too. But, you know,
if we can get there,

31:57.176 --> 31:59.439
and we've been through
hell and back,

31:59.439 --> 32:01.571
isn't there hope
for other people?

32:04.705 --> 32:06.663
Coming up next...

32:06.663 --> 32:09.710
I do feel like I lost
a part of me, you know.

32:09.710 --> 32:11.146
Yeah.

32:11.146 --> 32:13.235
God, I'm so sorry.

32:24.029 --> 32:26.248
Girl, Austin is
under construction.

32:26.248 --> 32:27.554
I know.

32:27.554 --> 32:28.990
That's a good thing.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

32:28.990 --> 32:30.818
That means there a lot
of money in the city, right?

32:30.818 --> 32:32.124
- Right.
- The banks are lending.

32:32.124 --> 32:32.863
- Right, right, right.
- The banks are lending.

32:32.863 --> 32:33.908
When I see construction,

32:33.908 --> 32:34.996
that means the banks
are lending.

32:34.996 --> 32:36.476
We're supposed
to heading to the pool,

32:36.476 --> 32:38.608
but there's something I wanted
to talk to you about.

32:38.608 --> 32:40.915
It's really not anything
I feel comfortable sharing

32:40.915 --> 32:43.657
with anybody else
other than you.

32:43.657 --> 32:47.095
So, you know we're going
through a lot with our finances.

32:47.095 --> 32:48.531
- Yeah.
- And the attorney

32:48.531 --> 32:50.446
that handled our sale--
- Yeah.

32:50.446 --> 32:52.709
He basically
stole money from us.

32:52.709 --> 32:53.972
I know.
- What?

32:53.972 --> 32:57.453
I know. He kept a portion
of the proceeds.

32:57.453 --> 33:00.804
He said he was holding it
in escrow until whenever.

33:00.804 --> 33:02.545
Oh, my God.

33:02.545 --> 33:04.156
We-we started realizing
that it was something wrong

33:04.156 --> 33:07.028
because he stopped
responding to us.

33:07.028 --> 33:08.334
- Yeah.
- We just decided

33:08.334 --> 33:11.119
to hire someone
to just do an investigation,

33:11.119 --> 33:13.469
and we reported him
to the Bar Association.

33:13.469 --> 33:15.863
Wow.
So, was he disbarred?

33:15.863 --> 33:17.473
Yeah,
he was disbarred.

33:17.473 --> 33:21.303
He went forth,
and he made a statement

33:21.303 --> 33:23.305
apologizing to us.

33:23.305 --> 33:25.481
Shortly after that,
he killed himself.

33:26.613 --> 33:29.833
- Oh, my God, are you
- ing serious?

33:29.833 --> 33:31.313
Yeah, I know.
I know.

33:31.313 --> 33:34.099
Girl, I have
been in tears.

33:34.099 --> 33:37.015
I have been having
panic attacks

33:37.015 --> 33:39.191
because it's just money.

33:39.191 --> 33:43.108
You know, I told Gordon,
I said, "Why?"

33:43.108 --> 33:45.545
I know you had opened up
and shared with me

33:45.545 --> 33:47.503
that something similar

33:47.503 --> 33:48.765
happened to you--
- Yeah.

33:48.765 --> 33:49.984
Where someone took
some of your money.

33:49.984 --> 33:51.464
Yeah. He was
in our wedding.

33:51.464 --> 33:53.161
He was one of Juan's
best friends.

33:53.161 --> 33:54.510
When our friend
took our money,

33:54.510 --> 33:57.122
he actually killed himself.
- Wow.

33:57.122 --> 34:00.516
He jumped off of a bridge
when all of it was revealed.

34:00.516 --> 34:02.605
He has a daughter,
a young daughter, and a wife.

34:02.605 --> 34:06.740
I feel guilty because I'm like,
had we not reported him,

34:06.740 --> 34:09.525
would he-- this have happened?
- Right.

34:09.525 --> 34:13.268
It is a horrible
and a devastating thing

34:13.268 --> 34:15.531
to go through, um,

34:15.531 --> 34:18.230
something that I don't wish
on my worst enemies,

34:18.230 --> 34:19.753
something that I wish
you could see, like,

34:19.753 --> 34:23.104
the warning signs
and prevent from happening.

34:23.104 --> 34:25.150
I feel so bad for her
'cause I know

34:25.150 --> 34:26.934
how horrible that is
to experience that.

34:26.934 --> 34:31.112
I promise you he's done it
to other clients,

34:31.112 --> 34:32.461
and they--
they didn't know yet.

34:32.461 --> 34:33.767
It was all gonna
catch up to him.

34:33.767 --> 34:35.160
Yeah, he said that.
That's my thing.

34:35.160 --> 34:37.553
I-I never want anything to
happen to anybody, ever,

34:37.553 --> 34:39.033
especially not over
some----ing money.

34:39.033 --> 34:41.079
I know.
God, I'm so sorry.

34:41.079 --> 34:42.645
I know.

34:42.645 --> 34:44.952
- Damn. I know.
- I know. Well, thank you.

34:44.952 --> 34:46.562
Oh, I'm sorry.

34:59.401 --> 35:01.229
Okay, so, what's
frozen pops?

35:01.229 --> 35:02.187
Like a popsicle?

35:02.187 --> 35:03.536
They're just popsicles.

35:03.536 --> 35:04.754
Yeah, I can put them in
a glass of champagne,

35:04.754 --> 35:06.495
if you're feeling
a little fancy.

35:06.495 --> 35:08.280
- No, I'm not that fancy.
- Or a shot of tequila or--

35:08.280 --> 35:10.108
- A shot of tequila.
- Okay, sounds good.

35:10.108 --> 35:12.588
I think the plane ride
was a lot.

35:12.588 --> 35:13.763
Was it?

35:13.763 --> 35:15.330
You were asleep
the whole time, Karen.

35:15.330 --> 35:16.723
I saw your head bobbing.
- How do you know?

35:16.723 --> 35:17.941
How do you know? I had my--
- I turned behind me

35:17.941 --> 35:20.814
and saw your head bobbing.
Okay, I saw you.

35:20.814 --> 35:22.424
I'm gonna switch gears

35:22.424 --> 35:23.860
and go back to Gizelle
for a minute

35:23.860 --> 35:25.471
because Gizelle and I
have been friends

35:25.471 --> 35:26.820
for a long,
long time.

35:26.820 --> 35:29.475
I want you just to feel free
to flow with this.

35:29.475 --> 35:32.434
I get it that you were
quiet, Gizelle,

35:32.434 --> 35:34.958
at pickleball,
but it was alarmingly quiet.

35:34.958 --> 35:37.483
To be honest with you,
the whole witchcraft stuff

35:37.483 --> 35:39.702
was-was disturbing to me.

35:39.702 --> 35:42.314
I'm aware of the phone call
that your mom made to my in-law.

35:42.314 --> 35:44.142
"Check on the people
I prayed against.

35:44.142 --> 35:46.318
They're not doing well."

35:46.318 --> 35:50.148
That is a disturbing
and harsh allegation.

35:50.148 --> 35:51.453
- Yes.
- Yes.

35:51.453 --> 35:53.368
And if you believe that,
then that's one thing.

35:53.368 --> 35:54.630
- I do.
- But I think it's important

35:54.630 --> 35:55.979
that you hear from Wendy.
- You said you do?

35:55.979 --> 35:57.633
Because she said it.

35:57.633 --> 36:00.158
She prays against people.
That's what she said.

36:00.158 --> 36:01.855
My whole
40 years of life,

36:01.855 --> 36:03.552
no one has threatened me
with a shrine.

36:03.552 --> 36:04.814
These are all things

36:04.814 --> 36:08.166
that you were not
on the phone to hear

36:08.166 --> 36:11.212
but all things in which now
you are coming up with.

36:11.212 --> 36:12.387
'Cause my in-law
is not a liar.

36:12.387 --> 36:13.562
She's not a liar.
- But-but you do admit

36:13.562 --> 36:15.956
that your mom has said
things about Mia.

36:15.956 --> 36:18.611
Yeah, but she didn't say
any of that type of stuff.

36:20.526 --> 36:22.832
Mia!

36:22.832 --> 36:24.312
Hey, Robyn.

36:24.312 --> 36:26.401
Come on in, ladies.

36:26.401 --> 36:29.230
How is it going? Y'all look
so cute and beachy.

36:29.230 --> 36:31.058
- Thank you.
- Yes.

36:33.408 --> 36:35.584
Why the looks?
What's going on?

36:37.673 --> 36:39.371
- Since Mia is here--
- What did I do?

36:39.371 --> 36:41.416
- Huh?
- Uh, Wendy's mother did,

36:41.416 --> 36:43.984
on social--
- Oh.

36:43.984 --> 36:46.247
Put you on a--
not put you on an altar,

36:46.247 --> 36:47.379
but--
- It's right here.

36:47.379 --> 36:49.555
I have it, verbatim...

36:58.128 --> 36:59.260
I'm bringing this up

36:59.260 --> 37:00.348
because Gizelle
wanted to bring it up.

37:00.348 --> 37:01.436
Okay.
- I kinda forgot.

37:01.436 --> 37:02.698
Thanks for reminding me.
- All right.

37:10.184 --> 37:12.752
There is no witchcraft there.

37:28.333 --> 37:30.857
There is no
witchcraft there.

37:33.468 --> 37:37.037
When I read that,
I did interpret

37:37.037 --> 37:39.692
that she was sending me
to the Holy Ghost fire.

37:39.692 --> 37:43.348
Holy ghost fire
and thunderous what?

37:43.348 --> 37:44.827
That's a prayer.

37:44.827 --> 37:47.047
That's my interpretation
of a good prayer to the Lord.

37:47.047 --> 37:49.310
This sounds
extremely threatening.

37:49.310 --> 37:51.007
This really doesn't
help her case.

37:51.007 --> 37:53.967
You should never
repeat that ever again.

37:53.967 --> 37:55.664
Holy Ghost-- she put
"Holy" in there.

37:55.664 --> 37:56.578
There's some good in that.

37:56.578 --> 37:58.319
It's--
it definitely is

37:58.319 --> 38:00.408
a little cause for pause,
you know.

38:00.408 --> 38:03.106
During pickleball,
Nneka kept on saying,

38:03.106 --> 38:04.804
"Your mom says she's gonna put
my name on a shrine.

38:04.804 --> 38:06.675
She's gonna do this.
She's gonna do that."

38:06.675 --> 38:08.982
It was never about Nneka.

38:08.982 --> 38:12.507
It was always about
her in-law, Lebe,

38:12.507 --> 38:14.248
and Ivy, my sister.

38:14.248 --> 38:16.381
Her and my sister
were friends.

38:16.381 --> 38:17.991
They're no longer friends.

38:19.906 --> 38:22.822
They have been on and off
for the past two.

38:22.822 --> 38:24.998
It's been shaky.
- Nice try.

38:24.998 --> 38:27.479
Nice try.

38:27.479 --> 38:30.786
It was not a fight
between friends.

38:30.786 --> 38:34.486
Ivy told my in-law
that Wendy was upset

38:34.486 --> 38:37.184
that I had allegedly
used her name,

38:37.184 --> 38:39.142
and I'm telling people that
she and I are friends,

38:39.142 --> 38:41.797
to be amongst a social circle.
- Okay, got it.

38:41.797 --> 38:43.582
- Which is incorrect.
- Okay.

38:43.582 --> 38:45.627
I met her at an event,
but I've never said that

38:45.627 --> 38:47.194
she and I are friends
'cause I don't know her.

38:47.194 --> 38:48.891
I met her in passing.
- Okay. Okay, got it.

38:48.891 --> 38:50.545
You knew
exactly who I was.

38:50.545 --> 38:52.417
You came,
and you specifically went

38:52.417 --> 38:55.071
against your fellow
Nigerian sister

38:55.071 --> 38:56.508
with the sole purpose--
- Goodbye.

38:56.508 --> 38:59.075
- And intent to attack me.
- Goodbye, goodbye.

38:59.075 --> 39:00.425
- You knew who I was.
- Get outta here.

39:00.425 --> 39:02.165
Get outta here.
I didn't know you.

39:02.165 --> 39:03.341
I still don't know you.

39:03.341 --> 39:04.385
Where did all
the hatred come from?

39:04.385 --> 39:05.560
- I know. That's--
- The hatred came

39:05.560 --> 39:06.735
- I'm missing something.
- From her sister

39:06.735 --> 39:08.171
communicating that
I'm a clout chaser.

39:08.171 --> 39:11.653
I'm jealous of you,
everything under the sun.

39:11.653 --> 39:14.003
She went and told her sister
and her mama

39:14.003 --> 39:16.397
that I was on the show,
and they were mad.

39:16.397 --> 39:17.833
I think there's some
truth to the fact

39:17.833 --> 39:20.314
that Wendy didn't want Nneka
to come on the show.

39:20.314 --> 39:22.534
Unfortunately,
Wendy is jealous.

39:22.534 --> 39:24.753
Wait, is that why
she was so mean to me?

39:24.753 --> 39:26.842
I had my boobs done,
and I had other tweaks.

39:26.842 --> 39:28.191
How about you?
What have you had done?

39:28.191 --> 39:29.628
- Oh, everything, honey.
- Because it seems like

39:29.628 --> 39:31.020
you've had a lot
of stuff done.

39:31.020 --> 39:32.674
I mean, you know,
she should just say it.

39:32.674 --> 39:34.676
Just say, "You know, I wanted
to be the only Nigerian.

39:34.676 --> 39:36.504
I wanted to hold it down
for my Nigerian people."

39:36.504 --> 39:37.810
Just say that.

39:37.810 --> 39:40.769
My in-law, Lebe Iwu,
received a phone call

39:40.769 --> 39:44.382
from her sister named Ivy.
- Okay.

39:44.382 --> 39:45.644
The next call I get

39:45.644 --> 39:48.908
is regarding messiness
and shrine,

39:48.908 --> 39:51.824
and it's above what I can
comprehend and understand

39:51.824 --> 39:54.348
because it's not something
I dabble in.

39:54.348 --> 39:55.871
They talked
for 52 minutes.

39:55.871 --> 39:58.526
I have the phone records,
52 minutes of me.

39:58.526 --> 40:00.136
- AT&T or Verizon? Which one?
- It's T-Mobile.

40:00.136 --> 40:01.529
- Okay, T-Mobile. Okay.
- T-Mobile.

40:01.529 --> 40:03.531
Her and my sister
were friends.

40:03.531 --> 40:05.098
They're no longer friends.

40:05.098 --> 40:06.316
As of April 7th,

40:06.316 --> 40:07.927
when your mom threatened
shrines on people.

40:07.927 --> 40:11.844
The falling out happened prior
to the April conversations?

40:11.844 --> 40:16.065
Your sister called my in-law
on April 2nd.

40:16.065 --> 40:18.720
You later on dialed in
on a separate line.

40:18.720 --> 40:21.897
- Why?
- You lie. You're a liar.

40:21.897 --> 40:24.639
They had correspondence
on April 2nd,

40:24.639 --> 40:26.598
April 4th,
and April 7th.

40:26.598 --> 40:28.426
2, 4, and 7-- those are
the dates you're saying?

40:28.426 --> 40:29.992
Yes.

40:29.992 --> 40:32.430
Remind me not to rob a bank
with these two hoes, okay?

40:32.430 --> 40:34.823
We're going to jail.

40:36.651 --> 40:39.306
It's confusing
to figure out, okay?

40:39.306 --> 40:41.439
See, this is why I can't
do this wit' y'all

40:41.439 --> 40:43.266
'cause I don't--
I can't keep up.

40:43.266 --> 40:46.748
Nneka had the phone record.
Nneka-Nneka called--

40:46.748 --> 40:49.751
Wendy called AT&T,
Verizon, somethin'.

40:49.751 --> 40:52.014
It was just-- I am so lost
in all of this.

40:52.014 --> 40:53.102
Here we are,

40:53.102 --> 40:57.716
screaming
about Lebe and Nigeria.

40:57.716 --> 40:58.978
How old is Lebe?

40:58.978 --> 41:01.067
I don't know.
That's my sister's friend.

41:01.067 --> 41:03.591
That's-- wait, is she
your sister's friend?

41:03.591 --> 41:06.768
- Are you lost? Are you lost?
- But she's not your friend.

41:06.768 --> 41:08.466
But she's not your friend?
- Are you lost?

41:08.466 --> 41:09.684
So, why are you
announcing her

41:09.684 --> 41:11.120
at your-your daughter's
sip and see then?

41:14.646 --> 41:17.518
That was--
that was-- no.

41:17.518 --> 41:21.087
When I think
of a Nigerian woman

41:21.087 --> 41:23.655
who is not only
filled with tradition

41:23.655 --> 41:26.832
but also the modern world,
I think of Lebe.

41:29.138 --> 41:30.792
You are cultural,

41:30.792 --> 41:32.490
but you are
still Western,

41:32.490 --> 41:33.621
and I love that
about you.

41:33.621 --> 41:34.970
Oh, she was there?

41:39.061 --> 41:40.933
You're do--
like, you're lost.

41:43.413 --> 41:46.982
It's weird to say that
you don't know someone

41:46.982 --> 41:49.550
when you would
invite someone

41:49.550 --> 41:52.988
to celebrate the birth
of your child.

41:52.988 --> 41:54.642
So, no, I don't
have the answer.

41:54.642 --> 41:56.644
Did they fall out?
I don't know.

41:56.644 --> 41:58.733
Who announces somebody
as someone

41:58.733 --> 41:59.952
you want your daughter
to emulate,

41:59.952 --> 42:01.127
if that's not
your friend?

42:05.174 --> 42:07.525
Next time on "The Real
Housewives of Potomac."

42:07.525 --> 42:09.831
Who, at the table, swallows?

42:09.831 --> 42:12.138
What?!

42:12.138 --> 42:13.792
Today's activity
is meant to be

42:13.792 --> 42:16.098
about reconnecting
with your vagina.

42:16.098 --> 42:17.143
Not I.

42:17.143 --> 42:19.014
Juan no longer
had the messages.

42:19.014 --> 42:20.886
Like, he cleans
his phone out like crazy.

42:20.886 --> 42:23.889
Bitch, what?!
What's not clicking here?

42:23.889 --> 42:25.673
Robyn, you're not
being accountable

42:25.673 --> 42:27.370
for lying
to this entire group.

42:27.370 --> 42:29.547
They're turning me
into a----ing villain.

42:31.157 --> 42:33.072
That's not your mama,
is it?
