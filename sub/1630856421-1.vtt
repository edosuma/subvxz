01:05:20.786 --> 01:05:22.614
Philippe could have
taken the shot.

01:05:22.744 --> 01:05:24.877
Man: You have many enemies.

01:05:25.008 --> 01:05:28.489
I'd like you
to meet my mother.

01:05:28.663 --> 01:05:30.883
You either saw something
you shouldn't have seen,

01:05:31.014 --> 01:05:33.451
or you know something
you shouldn't know.

01:05:33.581 --> 01:05:35.322
Philippe shows up
with a kid.

01:05:35.453 --> 01:05:38.543
The boy is the hub
of a many-spoked wheel.

01:05:38.717 --> 01:05:41.676
That sounds like something
you read in a fortune cookie.

01:05:41.807 --> 01:05:45.245
We all pretend,
Mr. Spade.

01:05:45.419 --> 01:05:48.335
If I want you dead,
I just have to wait.

01:05:48.509 --> 01:05:50.337
Mr. Spade, do you have any
specific information

01:05:50.468 --> 01:05:52.470
you want to share?Spade: They want the boy.

01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:55.560
Everyone from the Vatican
to French intelligence

01:05:55.734 --> 01:05:57.910
to the CIA
is after this kid.

01:05:58.041 --> 01:06:00.826
Woman: Mr. Spade,
you want to be left alone.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:04.482
And yet, sadly,
our pasts are portable.

01:06:04.656 --> 01:06:14.709
[Gunshot]
