WEBVTT

04:19.510 --> 04:21.596
<i>Loose!</i>

04:41.699 --> 04:43.785
If we live, Heahmund,
so be it.

04:44.494 --> 04:46.829
We might find some happiness
in Midgard.

04:47.789 --> 04:51.959
But if we die,
I doubt I shall see you again.

04:53.419 --> 04:55.046
For you would be
in your heaven

04:55.129 --> 04:56.964
which is not part
of this world, I think.

04:58.549 --> 05:00.134
I have no intention of dying.

05:00.510 --> 05:01.678
Not today.

05:02.303 --> 05:03.388
Not yet.

05:04.138 --> 05:05.431
I'm not ready.

05:07.308 --> 05:10.311
You still think it's up to you
whether you live or die?

05:10.395 --> 05:11.396
Yes.

05:17.985 --> 05:20.029
I think I might die this day.

05:20.113 --> 05:21.114
No.

05:24.701 --> 05:26.160
Kiss me a last time.

06:03.448 --> 06:04.657
Now I can die.

06:17.754 --> 06:18.755
Loose!

06:40.193 --> 06:41.319
<i>What are you
thinking of?</i>

06:42.195 --> 06:44.405
I'm thinking
I think many things, Ivar.

06:44.739 --> 06:45.823
Hmm.

06:46.407 --> 06:47.408
I thought,

06:47.784 --> 06:49.702
that you might be
thinking about Gladsheim...

06:51.120 --> 06:52.413
...where Valhalla

06:52.747 --> 06:54.499
is vast and gold bright.

06:55.708 --> 06:57.043
It might've crossed my mind.

06:59.212 --> 07:02.715
Its roof
is made out of shields
and its rafters of spears.

07:02.882 --> 07:04.425
Breast plates
litter the benches.

07:06.093 --> 07:09.180
The War Father
feeds his wolves,

07:09.263 --> 07:11.474
Freki and Geri,
with hunks of meat.

07:12.391 --> 07:15.603
The wine is always enough
for Odin's own needs.

07:17.897 --> 07:18.940
Every morning,

07:20.274 --> 07:22.485
his two ravens,
Huginn and Muninn,

07:23.069 --> 07:25.571
are loosed and they fly
over Midgard,

07:25.988 --> 07:27.406
in search for wisdom.

07:32.203 --> 07:36.833
I always fear that Thor
may fail to wing his way home.

07:38.960 --> 07:41.045
But my fear for memory
is greater.

07:43.714 --> 07:46.801
What do you fear most,
dear brother?

07:47.176 --> 07:50.596
The loss of thought or memory?

07:51.639 --> 07:53.975
My thoughts and memories
seem to be the same.

07:54.725 --> 07:56.394
Every time I think,

07:56.769 --> 07:59.939
I always remember the day
I jumped out of Ubbe's ship.

08:01.440 --> 08:02.859
But you didn't jump.

08:03.609 --> 08:04.610
The gods pushed you.

08:04.694 --> 08:06.571
Don't take it away from me.

08:06.654 --> 08:08.990
I wasn't pushed,
I decided to do it.

08:09.073 --> 08:10.783
And I think
you still regret it.

08:11.701 --> 08:13.077
I have no regrets.

08:14.287 --> 08:17.164
Except I don't have
any children.

08:18.207 --> 08:21.377
But then again,
Ivar, you and me are
in the same boat, huh?

08:22.378 --> 08:23.379
Nonsense.

08:23.921 --> 08:25.673
I will have children.
Oh.

08:25.756 --> 08:28.092
And my children
will populate the earth.

08:28.342 --> 08:29.927
Yeah. Sure.

08:36.767 --> 08:37.768
Ivar.

08:41.105 --> 08:42.106
Ivar!

08:48.696 --> 08:51.032
I'm anxious about the battle.
I am sorry.

08:54.118 --> 08:55.119
You're sorry?

08:57.872 --> 08:59.707
I'm sorry you jumped ship.

09:01.125 --> 09:02.335
It was a mistake.

09:02.793 --> 09:05.755
I know you have
regretted it ever since.

09:06.130 --> 09:09.091
And isn't that true, huh,
poor Hvitserk?

09:09.717 --> 09:11.719
Maybe sometimes.
"Maybe sometimes"?

09:14.221 --> 09:18.309
I thought that perhaps
you jumped ship
because you loved me.

09:21.479 --> 09:23.064
But, of course, you didn't.

09:24.398 --> 09:25.900
How could you ever love me?

09:27.777 --> 09:28.861
Are you ready?

09:35.660 --> 09:36.661
The war drum sounds.

10:01.560 --> 10:02.895
<i>You don't understand.</i>

10:03.729 --> 10:05.564
I'm sorry you jumped ship.

10:06.273 --> 10:07.483
It was a mistake.

10:08.150 --> 10:10.695
I know you have
regretted it ever since.

10:11.487 --> 10:14.615
Isn't that true, huh,
poor Hvitserk?

13:31.645 --> 13:33.230
Father?

13:34.899 --> 13:35.900
Father.

14:25.240 --> 14:27.117
I heard you singing
with your brother.

14:29.828 --> 14:31.121
This must be hard for you.

14:34.750 --> 14:36.293
Let me tell you something.

14:39.588 --> 14:41.256
I owe my brother so much.

14:42.549 --> 14:44.176
But I owe you far more.

14:46.178 --> 14:48.013
You took me
on a great adventure.

14:49.098 --> 14:50.641
You showed me that life has

14:52.601 --> 14:55.437
more to offer
than fighting for land,

14:57.272 --> 14:58.857
or for worthless glory,

14:59.775 --> 15:01.735
against your own
Viking brothers.

15:04.279 --> 15:08.033
And if I have to die today,
then so be it.

15:08.701 --> 15:10.202
I'm ready for Valhalla.

15:14.164 --> 15:16.583
At least I know
life has taught me something.

15:18.544 --> 15:20.504
You have taught me

15:22.256 --> 15:23.257
something.

15:26.802 --> 15:27.803
Thank you.

17:19.623 --> 17:21.166
I didn't want
to kill you, brother.

17:42.104 --> 17:43.397
This is life

17:48.068 --> 17:51.280
and this is death, brother.

18:00.164 --> 18:01.582
I will see you in Valhalla.

18:02.749 --> 18:04.501
I will see you in Valhalla.

18:05.669 --> 18:07.212
See you in Valhalla.

19:36.760 --> 19:38.470
This one is dead.

19:41.515 --> 19:43.308
Soon they will all be dead.

20:20.095 --> 20:21.346
Cut my hair.

20:27.144 --> 20:28.812
But you always say that...
I know.

20:29.354 --> 20:30.689
That I would never
cut my hair

20:30.772 --> 20:34.026
until the woman
of my dreams married me.

20:34.109 --> 20:35.110
But, now,

20:36.445 --> 20:38.530
the woman of my dreams
has married me.

20:39.573 --> 20:40.574
So, please,

20:43.744 --> 20:44.745
my wife,

20:46.038 --> 20:47.581
my beloved, my queen,

20:48.373 --> 20:49.666
cut my hair.

21:01.678 --> 21:02.846
Cut it.

21:24.576 --> 21:27.454
Please, tell me your sorrow.

21:29.414 --> 21:30.457
I can't.

21:33.293 --> 21:34.294
Sorry.

21:58.235 --> 22:00.237
<i>I think I might
die this day.</i>

22:01.780 --> 22:02.781
<i>No.</i>

22:14.918 --> 22:16.253
Now I can die.

23:09.681 --> 23:10.765
Guthrum!

23:16.980 --> 23:18.899
No!

24:31.263 --> 24:32.806
Whoa, there.

24:33.306 --> 24:35.558
Lagertha! Daughter!

24:37.852 --> 24:38.979
<i>I was afraid.</i>

24:39.646 --> 24:40.981
<i>There's no need to be afraid.</i>

24:41.606 --> 24:43.275
The gods look after us.

24:52.742 --> 24:54.119
Thor will take care of you.

24:54.744 --> 24:56.871
Thor will take care
of you always.

25:51.134 --> 25:52.260
Astrid.

25:54.471 --> 25:55.722
Astrid, stop.

25:56.389 --> 25:57.807
I don't want to kill you.

25:59.059 --> 26:00.185
You have to kill me.

26:01.311 --> 26:02.353
Why?

26:02.437 --> 26:04.064
Otherwise, we will kill you.

26:06.066 --> 26:07.442
You helped me.

26:07.776 --> 26:08.818
You didn't betray me.

26:08.902 --> 26:11.029
I know you love me.

26:16.493 --> 26:18.244
There's no use, Lagertha.

26:20.789 --> 26:21.956
I have to die.

26:22.040 --> 26:23.666
I cannot have this child.

26:28.004 --> 26:29.089
Child?

27:03.081 --> 27:04.290
It's done.

27:24.394 --> 27:25.895
Your poor child.

27:51.045 --> 27:53.047
May Freya lift you up

27:53.131 --> 27:55.425
and take you gently
to her hall.

27:57.427 --> 28:00.805
It's no more than you deserve,
sweet Astrid.

28:42.388 --> 28:44.682
We always played this
when we were young.

28:46.935 --> 28:49.395
Farewell, brother.

28:57.654 --> 29:02.116
Now go and take the rest
of your family with you.

29:18.508 --> 29:19.509
Sorry.

30:05.430 --> 30:06.931
I know your sadness.

30:09.434 --> 30:11.144
I lost my only child.

30:12.812 --> 30:14.105
And then my wife.

30:16.774 --> 30:20.278
And I have ached
with an endless sad longing.

30:22.321 --> 30:24.741
I don't suppose
it lasted that long.

30:26.701 --> 30:27.994
You had a lot to do.

30:28.578 --> 30:29.996
A lot of people to fool!

30:30.079 --> 30:32.290
I didn't want to fool you.

30:33.833 --> 30:38.463
I wanted to give you
the chance to share a life
in this new and amazing world.

30:38.546 --> 30:40.882
That was my sole desire.

30:45.344 --> 30:47.430
But please listen to me.

30:48.222 --> 30:49.766
Even in your anguish,

30:50.641 --> 30:53.352
don't think of revenging
the death of your son.

30:54.228 --> 30:55.396
It was an accident.

30:56.272 --> 30:58.232
It shouldn't have happened.
We all believe that.

30:59.567 --> 31:01.444
But if you are set
on revenge,

31:02.070 --> 31:05.615
then you will set in motion
a cycle of killing
that will never end.

31:11.579 --> 31:13.247
And whatever
hopes and dreams

31:13.331 --> 31:16.084
we might harbor and share
of a new beginning,

31:16.334 --> 31:17.543
of a different world...

31:24.801 --> 31:26.385
I beg you, Eyvind.

31:29.597 --> 31:33.101
You have as much invested
in this world as I have.

31:34.727 --> 31:38.106
And your son lies in its soil.

31:48.157 --> 31:49.867
I will make you lawgiver here.

31:55.081 --> 31:57.125
You will have your power
and authority.

31:59.210 --> 32:00.711
But only on one condition.

32:01.796 --> 32:05.299
That we never return
to the cycle of death
and revenge

32:05.383 --> 32:08.261
that has blighted
and disfigured
all our lives before.

32:13.474 --> 32:14.767
What do you say?

33:21.083 --> 33:22.460
<i>I don't want to forget.</i>

33:23.961 --> 33:27.798
I don't want to forget
why I'm really going
into battle this day.

34:41.622 --> 34:42.957
Archers!

34:44.625 --> 34:45.626
Loose!

34:52.508 --> 34:53.718
They are dying.

34:54.343 --> 34:55.678
I have seen it.

34:56.554 --> 34:58.139
As I foresaw.

34:58.681 --> 35:00.433
As I foresuffered.

35:00.933 --> 35:05.980
Ragnar's death
would lead to calamities
and horrors beyond measure.

35:06.355 --> 35:08.441
Beyond imagining.

35:09.984 --> 35:12.611
Pity the sons of Ragnar.

35:14.113 --> 35:16.574
Watching these events,

35:16.657 --> 35:19.910
even the gods weep.

35:21.495 --> 35:25.416
I came to ask you...
I know what you
came for, Margrethe,

35:26.459 --> 35:27.793
slave woman.

35:28.419 --> 35:30.921
Will my husband, Ubbe,
rule Kattegat?

35:31.005 --> 35:32.006
No.

35:32.089 --> 35:33.299
Will I be Queen?

35:33.382 --> 35:34.633
No.

35:34.717 --> 35:36.552
You don't know everything.

35:37.553 --> 35:38.637
No.

35:39.638 --> 35:42.600
I have Bjorn's two children
in my care.

35:42.683 --> 35:47.021
If I killed them,
Ubbe would be closer
to the crown.

35:47.813 --> 35:49.523
Yes, that's true.

35:49.607 --> 35:52.777
Then why do you say
that Ubbe will not be King?

35:52.860 --> 35:55.905
I said he would
not be King of Kattegat.

35:57.031 --> 35:58.366
Then what?

35:59.825 --> 36:04.830
I don't want to be dug up
from the wet earth anymore.

36:04.914 --> 36:08.000
Especially by mad people.

36:08.751 --> 36:10.419
You think I'm mad?

36:10.878 --> 36:13.464
I don't think anything.

36:13.547 --> 36:15.007
I know.

36:15.508 --> 36:18.052
And what is the problem
with that?

36:19.595 --> 36:23.099
Perhaps the mad
will inherit the earth.

37:11.147 --> 37:12.648
Soon, you'll get to live

37:13.315 --> 37:17.319
in Valhalla with your brave
and great father, Jarl Borg.

37:24.076 --> 37:25.578
Archers!

37:28.038 --> 37:31.000
Let your arrows
fall on them like rain!

37:31.667 --> 37:32.668
Kill them.

37:32.918 --> 37:33.919
Loose!

38:12.833 --> 38:13.918
Go!

38:19.465 --> 38:20.966
Retreat!

39:10.641 --> 39:11.684
What is it?

39:38.335 --> 39:39.628
<i>Ketill Flatnose.</i>

39:40.713 --> 39:42.506
<i>Your son, Thorgrim, is dead.</i>

40:08.157 --> 40:09.366
Ah, Lagertha.

40:11.035 --> 40:12.161
Don't be a coward.

40:13.287 --> 40:14.371
Come and fight me.

40:18.876 --> 40:20.002
Come and fight me.

41:31.281 --> 41:32.282
Oh, I know.

41:34.284 --> 41:36.703
I know only too well
what happens next.

41:41.250 --> 41:42.251
This is not right.

41:43.710 --> 41:45.796
This is not
how I imagined everything.

41:52.386 --> 41:54.054
But no doubt I am a fool.

41:55.973 --> 41:57.891
I was always called a fool.

41:59.977 --> 42:01.520
And now I have proved it.

42:07.234 --> 42:08.694
We have failed the gods.

42:11.071 --> 42:12.990
We have behaved like humans.

42:14.533 --> 42:16.201
They gave us
every opportunity

42:16.285 --> 42:18.495
to be better people,
and we have all failed.

42:23.125 --> 42:26.503
There's only one way
to stop our settlement
from descending into chaos.

42:27.588 --> 42:30.340
We must offer a sacrifice
which will mean something.

42:31.467 --> 42:35.012
A sacrifice which will give us
a second chance.

42:35.762 --> 42:36.972
I am the builder.

42:38.849 --> 42:41.059
I am responsible
for all of this.

42:42.561 --> 42:44.688
I see now
I must be held to account.

42:45.731 --> 42:46.732
Therefore...

42:49.067 --> 42:51.528
I offer myself
as that sacrifice.

43:33.570 --> 43:34.738
Margrethe?

43:40.160 --> 43:41.453
Where are my children?

43:43.539 --> 43:44.665
Margrethe?

43:45.082 --> 43:46.875
Where are my children?

44:22.119 --> 44:24.496
Gather your things.
We must leave Kattegat.
