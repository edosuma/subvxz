00:09.719 --> 00:10.970
What room did she say?

00:11.053 --> 00:12.304
Twelve. Room 12.

00:12.388 --> 00:13.806
I think she said ten.

00:13.889 --> 00:15.850
- I heard eight.
- She said 12.

00:15.933 --> 00:18.144

Should I go back and check?

00:18.227 --> 00:19.854
Yes. Go back and check.

[Abe] Are you being sarcastic?

00:21.355 --> 00:22.732

00:25.067 --> 00:26.610
Oy, my God.

00:26.694 --> 00:28.279
It's bad, isn't it, Abe?

00:28.362 --> 00:30.406
Papa? You want to
go get people coffee?

00:30.489 --> 00:32.241
- Who wants coffee?
- [others] Mm-mm.

00:32.324 --> 00:34.785
- Everyone wants coffee.
- Guess I'll get coffee.

00:34.869 --> 00:36.662
- Oh.
- What are they saying?

00:36.746 --> 00:38.914
- They say he's going to die.
- They didn't say that.

00:38.998 --> 00:40.791
Well, they said
he's probably going to die.

00:40.875 --> 00:42.793
Ma, they're still doing tests.

00:42.877 --> 00:44.336
A lot of tests but no word yet.

00:44.420 --> 00:46.547
"No word" means he's
definitely going to die.

00:46.630 --> 00:47.923
You don't know that, Shirley.

00:48.007 --> 00:49.884
- You know something
that I don't?
- No.

00:49.967 --> 00:51.844

speak to somebody upstairs

00:51.927 --> 00:52.928
and tell you the future?

00:53.012 --> 00:54.054
- Ma.
- Because I was sitting

00:54.138 --> 00:55.347
right here when the doctor said

00:55.431 --> 00:58.684
he absolutely,
positively is going to die.

01:00.394 --> 01:01.729
I didn't bring my wallet.

01:01.812 --> 01:03.355
That's okay.
No one wants coffee.

01:03.439 --> 01:05.107
Then why did you send me
to get coffee?

01:05.191 --> 01:07.693
Just stay with Shirley
and don't speak.

01:07.777 --> 01:10.112

I killed my father.

01:17.661 --> 01:19.038
- Joel, no.
- Yes.

01:19.121 --> 01:20.664
Yes, I'm like that guy, uh...

01:20.748 --> 01:22.082
- Who was it?
- Who was who?

01:22.166 --> 01:23.751
The guy in the Bible
that killed his father.

01:23.834 --> 01:25.169
I don't know. Uh, Abraham?

01:25.252 --> 01:27.254
No. He was the one
who almost killed his son.

01:27.338 --> 01:29.298
- Absalom?
- No. It didn't start
with an "A."

01:29.381 --> 01:30.883
Uh, Oedipus?

01:30.966 --> 01:32.635
- That's not the Bible.
- But he killed his father.

01:32.718 --> 01:33.803
And married his mother.

01:33.886 --> 01:35.513
Well, other than that,
I'm that guy.

01:35.596 --> 01:37.306
Joel...

01:37.389 --> 01:39.558
- What happened?
- [sighs]

01:39.642 --> 01:42.228
He, uh, he came to the club.
He had the costumes with him.

01:42.311 --> 01:44.396
- Uh, a pineapple, a carrot.
Very cute.
- I know.

01:44.480 --> 01:46.398
Oh, there was an option
of them both being grapes.

01:46.482 --> 01:47.942
If you wanted to keep Esther
from running off,

01:48.025 --> 01:49.151
- you'd tie 'em together
like a bunch of...
- Uh-huh.

01:49.235 --> 01:50.361
- Circle back around, honey.
- Right.

01:50.444 --> 01:52.488
Uh, so I thought,
he's here, he's happy.

01:52.571 --> 01:54.490
Good time to tell him about Mei.

01:54.573 --> 01:56.200
- What did you say?
- I was nervous,

01:56.283 --> 01:58.661
so I-I just blurted shit out,
and I think I kind of

01:58.744 --> 02:00.287
mushed "Chinese"
and "pregnant" together.

02:00.371 --> 02:02.373
I should've let one sink in,
then hit him with the other.

02:02.456 --> 02:03.791
I don't think it was you.

02:03.874 --> 02:06.085
Really. I think it was me.

02:06.168 --> 02:07.586
- What?
- I did it. I killed Moishe.

02:07.670 --> 02:08.921
- You did not kill Moishe.
- Our last conversation,

02:09.004 --> 02:10.464
I told him I couldn't
pay him his money,

02:10.548 --> 02:12.383
and he literally told me
he was having a heart attack.

02:12.466 --> 02:13.759
- When was this?
- Two weeks ago.

02:13.843 --> 02:15.386
Pretty slow heart attack.

02:15.469 --> 02:17.137
But maybe I laid the track for
him to have the heart attack.

02:17.221 --> 02:19.431
Got him started, and then you
came in and finished him off.

02:19.515 --> 02:21.267
- This is very comforting.
- You didn't kill your father.

02:21.350 --> 02:22.977
- Well, neither did you.
- [doctor] Room 12.
Moishe Maisel.

02:23.060 --> 02:24.436
The wife's a hysterical.

02:24.520 --> 02:26.564
- [doctor sighs]
- I-I should get back in there

02:26.647 --> 02:27.940
to listen to them
tell us nothing.

02:28.023 --> 02:29.191
Because otherwise,
it's a long time

02:29.275 --> 02:30.651
before they come back
to tell us nothing.

02:30.734 --> 02:32.820
Twelve. I think it's room 12.
Joel, Midge, how is he?

02:32.903 --> 02:34.446
We don't know.
He's unconscious.

02:34.530 --> 02:35.447
[Archie] Unconscious?

02:35.531 --> 02:37.575
[groans] Jesus. I'm so sorry.

02:37.616 --> 02:40.703
- Thanks, pal.
- No, I mean...

02:40.786 --> 02:42.329
- I killed your father, Joel.
- What?

02:42.413 --> 02:44.039
[Archie] I lost the money.

02:44.164 --> 02:46.250
If that money hadn't have gotten
ripped out of my hands...

02:46.333 --> 02:47.793
- Archie.
- That's when
all the trouble started.

02:47.877 --> 02:49.628
I had nothing to do with this,
so I'll just be the person

02:49.712 --> 02:51.213
- who pats people's arms.
- Calm down, Arch.

02:51.297 --> 02:52.506
Really.
It's nice you're here.

02:52.590 --> 02:53.966
Should I go tell your mother
it was my fault?

02:54.049 --> 02:55.801
- I'll do it later.
- [Mei] This way to room 12?

02:55.885 --> 02:57.678
Finally. I left you a message
over an hour ago.

02:57.761 --> 02:59.305
- Where have you been?
- Yankee Stadium.

02:59.388 --> 03:01.140
- Why?
- Because the message
you left Li Wei said,

03:01.223 --> 03:02.516
"Go to Yankee Stadium."

03:02.600 --> 03:03.976

- [sighs]

03:07.396 --> 03:09.940
- [Joel] I don't know.
- [Mei] He'll be okay.

03:10.024 --> 03:12.276

What just happened?

03:12.359 --> 03:14.194

Nothing's changed.

get a second line in here.

- Can you hold, please?

08:55.410 --> 08:56.954
What do you got, Maggie?

08:57.037 --> 08:59.373
Someone calling about
that weird magic guy.

08:59.456 --> 09:00.999
- Does he do birthday parties?
- Hold on.

09:02.084 --> 09:03.126
Hold on.

09:03.210 --> 09:04.294
Does Alfie do birthday parties?

09:04.378 --> 09:05.671
Only if it's Billy Wilder's.

09:05.754 --> 09:08.382
I love when they talk about me
like I'm not here.

09:08.465 --> 09:10.133
No, I really do.

09:10.217 --> 09:11.760
You know the minute they get
another chair in here,

09:11.843 --> 09:13.345
our relationship is over, right?

09:13.428 --> 09:15.222
[Dinah] They asked, what if they
threw in car fare and lunch?

09:15.305 --> 09:17.057
- [Susie] No birthday parties...
- I don't know what
you're looking at.

09:17.140 --> 09:19.851
- I did not bring these for you.
- [Dinah] I'm sorry,
that's not gonna work.

09:19.935 --> 09:21.728
- [kids laughing]
- That's a big no there, Maggie.

09:21.812 --> 09:23.814
Geez, wouldn't have thought a
magician could pick and choose.

09:23.897 --> 09:25.399
- [chuckles]
- No.

09:25.482 --> 09:27.150
[Frank] You got Maggie
working for you now, huh?

09:27.234 --> 09:28.735
Well, I tell people
if they can't get through here

09:28.819 --> 09:30.696
to call over there.
You know Maggie?

09:30.779 --> 09:33.073
I know her boss, Gil.
He paints houses for us.

09:33.156 --> 09:34.741
Huh. I thought he was a plumber.

09:34.825 --> 09:37.452
- [phone rings]
- Susie Myerson and Associates?

09:37.536 --> 09:39.871
Dinah, it's Midge. I need to
talk to Susie for a moment.

09:39.955 --> 09:41.456
Hi, Midge. We don't have
any bookings for you.

09:41.540 --> 09:42.833
I'll tell her you called. Bye.

09:42.916 --> 09:44.209
[Midge] Dinah, wait...

09:44.293 --> 09:45.335
Cissy, what's that

09:45.419 --> 09:46.753
- I'm no snitch!

- Yeah, Maggie?

09:50.841 --> 09:53.635
Florenz Ziegfeld's on the phone!
It's very important!

09:53.719 --> 09:55.220
Okay. Send him over.

09:55.304 --> 09:57.139
Susie, Florenz Ziegfeld's
on the phone.

09:57.222 --> 09:59.141
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.
- [phone ringing]

09:59.224 --> 10:00.934
- The light's not lit up.
- It's on the other line.

10:01.018 --> 10:03.061
- I thought we didn't have
another line.
- The clothesline.

10:03.145 --> 10:05.230
- What?
- Just come get it. I have to
pick up the other phone.

10:05.314 --> 10:06.690
What do you mean you have to
pick up the other phone?

10:06.773 --> 10:08.108
Aren't you on the other phone?

10:09.818 --> 10:11.611
Wait, isn't
Florenz Ziegfeld dead?

10:11.695 --> 10:12.696
Yep. He died in '32.

10:12.779 --> 10:15.324
Let me check.
What was that date again?

10:15.407 --> 10:18.827
[Susie] Great system
we got here.

10:18.910 --> 10:20.454
This is Susie Myerson.

10:21.913 --> 10:22.998
- Miriam?
- Yes.

10:23.081 --> 10:24.291
Oh, so Ziegfeld is dead.

10:24.374 --> 10:25.792
Course he is. I saw the body.

10:25.876 --> 10:27.127
Listen, Joel's father
had a heart attack.

10:27.210 --> 10:28.462
I have to get back
to the hospital.

10:28.545 --> 10:29.921
Do you think
you could send someone

10:30.005 --> 10:31.923
- down to the club
to sub for me?
- Uh, hold on.

10:32.007 --> 10:34.259
James, you want to fill in
for Midge down at the Wolford?

10:34.343 --> 10:36.261
You know, easy money,
half-naked chicks?

10:36.345 --> 10:38.388
You promised not
to book me toilet gigs.

10:38.472 --> 10:40.098
Tell him I heard that.

10:40.182 --> 10:41.808
Never mind.
I'll think of something.

10:41.892 --> 10:44.394
Okay. Sorry about your
not at all father-in-law.

10:44.478 --> 10:45.979
- Uh-huh.
- Just gonna keep saying it

10:46.063 --> 10:47.230
till it sinks the fuck in.

10:47.314 --> 10:48.440
Kids are still here,
aren't they?

10:48.523 --> 10:49.441
- Yep.
- Mother...

10:49.524 --> 10:50.734
- Susie.
- Yep.

10:50.817 --> 10:52.235

- [woman] Village Voice.

10:53.445 --> 10:55.030
- What do we think?
- I cover nightlife, man.

10:55.113 --> 10:56.615
If the dude's not holding
a sax or a joint,

10:56.698 --> 10:58.325
- I have no opinion.
- Find one.

10:58.408 --> 11:00.535
My opinion is, if Nixon wins,
we move to France.

11:00.619 --> 11:01.828
I have a rent-controlled
apartment,

11:01.912 --> 11:03.163
so I'm gonna stick it out. You?

in that one,

11:04.623 --> 11:05.832

However, that one,
he's just plain adorable.

11:07.876 --> 11:11.296

- I was talking about Nixon.

11:16.218 --> 11:19.262
Fine. I want you to write
an obituary for Moishe Maisel,

11:19.346 --> 11:20.847
owner of Maisel and Roth.

11:20.931 --> 11:23.266
He's an American success story.

Self-made garment manufacturer.

11:25.185 --> 11:27.521
I told you about the 13 Jews.

11:27.604 --> 11:30.899
Why not? You wrote one
for Albert Einstein.

11:30.982 --> 11:32.984
Well, Moishe Maisel
put a new kind of elastic

11:33.068 --> 11:34.861
in his ultra men's
breathable briefs.

11:34.945 --> 11:36.988
So, yes, Einstein transformed

11:37.072 --> 11:38.865

and astronomy,

11:38.949 --> 11:41.576

theory of mechanics

11:41.660 --> 11:43.620

by Isaac Newton,

11:43.703 --> 11:47.457

11:47.541 --> 11:50.460
You're a New Yorker.
You know what summer's like.

11:50.544 --> 11:52.838
Excuse me. Why are you here?

11:52.921 --> 11:54.881
Oh, I'm Abe's personal
part-time secretary.

11:54.965 --> 11:56.133
I do his typing. You?

11:56.216 --> 11:57.384
I work here.

11:57.467 --> 11:58.969
- Doing what?
- Many things.

11:59.052 --> 12:01.763
- Right now,
I'm very busy filing.
- I see the stack.

12:01.847 --> 12:04.558
- I used to type for Abe,
but now he has you.
- He does.

12:04.641 --> 12:05.725
- Part-time.
- For now.

12:05.809 --> 12:07.352
Full-time.

12:07.436 --> 12:09.896
Fine. I'm canceling
my subscription.

12:09.980 --> 12:12.983
I'll read the grease-stained

12:13.066 --> 12:14.860
"What's he known for?"
he kept saying.

12:14.943 --> 12:16.361
"What's he known for?"

12:16.445 --> 12:18.321
As if a-a man's life is measured

12:18.405 --> 12:20.157
by how many people
have heard of him?

12:20.240 --> 12:22.576
Mickey Mouse,
a known anti-Semite,

12:22.659 --> 12:24.369
can get an obituary
in The New York Times,

12:24.453 --> 12:25.912
but Moishe Maisel cannot?

12:25.996 --> 12:28.623
Okay, time-out. I will call
Simon Mellman at The Times.

12:28.707 --> 12:31.084
- Isobel, get Simon for me.
- [Isobel] Okay.

12:31.168 --> 12:33.086
Simon is a very good
friend of mine,

12:33.170 --> 12:37.716
and he owes me several favors,
$300 and a fiancée.

12:37.799 --> 12:40.719
[Isobel] Got him.
Please hold for Gabe Walensky.

12:40.802 --> 12:43.305
- Simon, Gabe. How are you?
- Tell him about the Jews.

12:43.388 --> 12:45.765
- Yeah, listen,
I'm calling in a chip here.
- Thirteen of them.

12:45.849 --> 12:47.934
I need your team to do
an obituary for a friend.

12:48.018 --> 12:50.145

12:50.228 --> 12:52.439
- Tell him about the Jews.
- The history of, or...

12:52.522 --> 12:54.274
Yeah, no, Simon, I'm here.

12:54.357 --> 12:56.234

- Moishe Maisel.

12:56.318 --> 12:58.153
Moishe Maisel. And he was...

12:58.236 --> 12:59.988
- In the garment business.
- In the garment business.

13:00.071 --> 13:01.698
There was no Roth.
Moishe made him up.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.658
- That's right.
- He never went to Turkey!

13:03.742 --> 13:05.827
- What are you talking about?
- He had a Turkish plumber.

13:05.911 --> 13:07.120
Kev, hold him.

13:07.204 --> 13:08.830
Yes, I'm here.

13:08.914 --> 13:10.332
I know, but this is a favor.

13:10.415 --> 13:11.875
Simon, let me remind you

13:11.958 --> 13:13.960
that you stole Diana from me
at my own birthday party.

13:14.044 --> 13:16.421
Yes, you did,
you traitorous asshole!

13:16.505 --> 13:18.632
And I think the very least
you could do for me now

13:18.715 --> 13:20.509
is have one of
your obit guys type up

13:20.592 --> 13:22.344
a goddamn obit for this man.

13:22.427 --> 13:24.262
And give me my $300 back!

13:25.347 --> 13:27.682
Well, fuck you!

13:27.766 --> 13:30.268
Listen up, everybody.

13:30.352 --> 13:33.438
Simon Mellman is
persona non grata from now on.

13:33.522 --> 13:35.899
Never met him,
never heard of him.

13:35.982 --> 13:39.361
He is Nikolai Khokhlov,
and we are Russia.

13:39.444 --> 13:41.238
- What?
- And these are the covers.

with that, suck it!

- Sorry, Abe. I can't help you.
- Well, fine.

13:46.952 --> 13:48.620
I guess there's nothing to do
but write it myself.

13:48.703 --> 13:49.996
- Dody?
- Yes, Abe?

13:50.080 --> 13:51.873
Fresh piece of paper, please.

13:51.957 --> 13:53.416
Where is this
being published, Abe?

13:53.500 --> 13:54.834
Here, in The Village Voice.

13:54.918 --> 13:56.461
The Voice doesn't do obits.

13:56.545 --> 13:58.838
Great. Then it's a brief,
informative article

13:58.922 --> 14:00.799

for that, don't you think?

16:08.301 --> 16:09.636
Different talk.

16:09.719 --> 16:11.346
We should figure out
how it's gonna work.

16:11.429 --> 16:12.514
How what's gonna work?

16:12.597 --> 16:15.809
You know, with you and me
and Joel and the kids.

16:15.892 --> 16:17.936
I mean, you'll be, you know...

16:18.019 --> 16:19.479
They'll be, you know...

16:19.562 --> 16:21.231
- Clearly, I don't know.
- Mei, come on.

16:21.314 --> 16:23.733
Obviously, they live with me,
but they'll be with you a lot,

16:23.817 --> 16:26.486
and now they'll have a sibling,
and I just think we need

16:26.569 --> 16:28.697
- to discuss some ground rules.
- Like?

16:28.780 --> 16:30.949
Like I don't want them
calling you Mom.

16:31.032 --> 16:32.659
- Me, either.
- But they'll need
to call you something.

16:32.742 --> 16:34.202
- Why?
- Why?

16:34.285 --> 16:35.954
Well, what if they lock
themselves in your bathroom

16:36.037 --> 16:37.455
and they need
to call out for help?

16:37.539 --> 16:39.874
- Why are they in my bathroom?
- Because it's bath time.

16:39.958 --> 16:41.543
They're bathing in my bathroom?

16:41.626 --> 16:43.294
- Mei, come on.
- They're your kids.
You bathe 'em.

16:43.378 --> 16:44.921
- But they're staying with you.
- Why?

16:45.004 --> 16:46.756
- Because it's your weekend.
- To do what?

16:46.840 --> 16:49.634
To take them because
you are married to their father.

16:52.262 --> 16:54.723
- Aren't you?
- [chiming over P.A.]

16:54.806 --> 16:57.016
[woman over P.A.] Phone call
for Midge Maisel.

16:57.100 --> 16:59.018
Phone call for Midge Maisel.

16:59.102 --> 17:01.229
- Please come
to the nurses' station.
- Excuse me.

17:07.652 --> 17:09.696
- Hello?
- You have to come back.

17:09.779 --> 17:11.698
- I told you
my father-in-law is...
- Yes, I know.

17:11.781 --> 17:14.701
So sad. But see,
you made me change everything.

17:14.784 --> 17:16.619
- Boise.
- I can see myself
in the toilet bowls.

17:16.703 --> 17:18.538
They're so clean. It's gorgeous.

17:18.621 --> 17:20.373
- Well, that's great.
- I bought the fruit

17:20.457 --> 17:23.001
and the umbrellas
and the tampon sticks.

17:23.084 --> 17:24.753
- The good ones?
- Yes, the good ones, Midge.

17:24.836 --> 17:26.004
The best ones.

17:26.087 --> 17:27.964
You demanded these changes,
and I did them,

17:28.047 --> 17:30.008
and then all these women
came to see you.

17:30.091 --> 17:31.259
And now you are not here,

17:31.342 --> 17:32.510
and they are very angry.

17:32.594 --> 17:34.471
- I'm sorry.
- I invented a drink.

17:34.554 --> 17:36.514
- Oh, yeah?
- It is pink and fizzy

17:36.598 --> 17:37.766
and you set it on fire.

17:37.849 --> 17:38.933
It's stunning.

17:39.017 --> 17:40.435
I've named it
"I Once Was a Man."

17:40.518 --> 17:42.604
I see we've developed
a flair for the dramatic.

17:42.687 --> 17:43.688
Please come back.

17:43.772 --> 17:45.398
Boise, I gave Bunny,
Mitzi and Gloria

17:45.482 --> 17:46.649
some really good jokes to do.

17:46.733 --> 17:47.859
How did that go?

17:47.942 --> 17:50.320
We got a new sign
to go on the door here.

17:50.403 --> 17:52.614
On one side, it says,
"We're open.

17:52.697 --> 17:54.449
Please come inside."

17:54.532 --> 17:57.494
And on the other side, it says,
"Sorry we're closed."

17:57.577 --> 17:58.787
I don't get it.

17:58.870 --> 18:00.330
I don't think
that's what it says.

18:00.413 --> 18:02.415
What it fucking says.
I'm looking at it right here.

18:02.499 --> 18:04.584
- "Sorry we're..."
- "Clothed."

18:04.667 --> 18:06.878
- [man laughing]
- It says,
"Sorry we're clothed."

18:06.961 --> 18:08.421
Like we have our clothes on.

18:08.505 --> 18:10.548
- [scattered laughter]
- Okay.

18:10.632 --> 18:14.177
And on the other side,
it says, "Sorry we're clothed."

18:14.260 --> 18:16.888
- I still don't get it.
- [drummer plays rim shot]
- [giggles]

18:16.971 --> 18:18.348
So, thanks for that
bit of casting.

18:18.431 --> 18:20.308
Look, Boise,
I promise I will get there

18:20.391 --> 18:21.726
as soon as I possibly can.

18:21.810 --> 18:23.311

It's very nice
to be here, really.

20:45.078 --> 20:47.038
You have no idea.

20:48.081 --> 20:50.667
So I have a little
family drama going on.

20:50.750 --> 20:54.253
My ex-father-in-law
just had a heart attack.

20:54.337 --> 20:57.382
He's unconscious,
and they have no idea

20:57.465 --> 20:59.592
- if he's gonna make it or not.
- [man] Woo-hoo! [clapping]

20:59.676 --> 21:02.136
- Thank you.
- [sparse laughter]

21:02.220 --> 21:05.181

- That's nice.

Good for you, sir.

21:10.144 --> 21:11.896
[laughter]

21:11.980 --> 21:14.023
So, anyhow,
for the last couple of days,

21:14.107 --> 21:16.109
I have been reduced
to playing the coffee lounge

21:16.192 --> 21:18.069
- at Beth Israel Hospital.
- [laughter]

21:18.152 --> 21:20.613
I'm going back there
as soon as I'm done here,

21:20.697 --> 21:23.282
and I'll spend the night
watching all the men in my life

21:23.366 --> 21:24.951
completely fall apart.

21:25.034 --> 21:26.619
- While eating Jell-O.
- [laughter]

21:26.703 --> 21:28.871
It's really startling, actually.

21:28.955 --> 21:31.249
Because we're always told,
"You're daddy's little girl."

21:31.332 --> 21:32.667
"Daddy will protect you."

21:32.750 --> 21:34.210
"Wait till your father
gets home."

21:34.293 --> 21:35.795
And then your father
walks into a hospital,

21:35.878 --> 21:37.213
and he turns into
a ten-year-old girl

21:37.296 --> 21:38.965
who just had a frog
put down her dress.

21:39.048 --> 21:41.259
- [laughter]
- Now, my father--

21:41.342 --> 21:44.762
intellectual, emotions kept
in a little bottle in storage--

21:44.846 --> 21:46.889
he hates hospitals.

21:46.973 --> 21:50.184
He hates the smell of hospitals,
the look of hospitals.

21:50.268 --> 21:52.270
[chuckles] When I had
my daughter, I had to hold her

21:52.353 --> 21:54.313
out the window as he walked
to work in the morning

21:54.397 --> 21:56.315
- just so he could see her.
- [laughter]

21:56.399 --> 21:58.317
And then there's my husband.

21:58.401 --> 22:02.613
Ex-husband, actually,
but we're still... something.

22:02.697 --> 22:05.241
Now, in all fairness,
I have seen him emotional.

22:05.324 --> 22:07.201
When the Brooklyn Dodgers
moved to...

22:07.285 --> 22:08.578
[whispers] California...

22:08.661 --> 22:10.538
[regular volume] he was
inconsolable.

22:10.621 --> 22:12.665
He sat in the dark,
eating chocolate,

22:12.749 --> 22:14.917
writing love letters
to Sandy Koufax.

22:15.001 --> 22:17.670
- [laughter]
- He'd try to put on
a brave face,

22:17.754 --> 22:20.048
and we'd walk past a hot dog
cart, and he'd fall to pieces,

22:20.131 --> 22:22.216
cradling the mustard container
in his arms,

22:22.300 --> 22:25.720
repeating the 1955 World Series
lineup over and over again.

22:25.803 --> 22:28.514
[laughter, applause]

22:28.598 --> 22:31.809
And then, of course,
there is my father-in-law.

22:31.893 --> 22:35.146
Tough, proud.

22:35.229 --> 22:38.357
And now my mother-in-law
is trimming his beard, so if...

22:40.860 --> 22:45.698
...when he wakes up,
he's ready to go to work.

22:48.910 --> 22:51.454
It's hard seeing
the men in your life scared.

22:52.789 --> 22:54.499
And with the men
out of commission,

22:54.582 --> 22:56.709
the women are left
to keep things going.

22:56.793 --> 22:58.753
Now, this is not
totally unusual, right?

22:58.836 --> 23:00.713
I mean, women could be
bleeding from the head,

23:00.797 --> 23:01.923
and they'd host a dinner party

23:02.006 --> 23:03.549
if the invitations
were already sent out.

23:03.633 --> 23:06.511
- [laughter]
- But we never think
about it like that.

23:06.594 --> 23:10.056
We just assume we're
supporting the real leaders.

23:11.182 --> 23:13.768
You look around this hospital,
you see the doctors.

23:13.851 --> 23:17.271
All men, swaggering in and out
of the rooms really fast.

23:17.355 --> 23:19.649
"I'm important.
I have a pen in my pocket.

23:19.732 --> 23:21.109
I look at a chart.
Hmm, good chart.

23:21.192 --> 23:22.443
I sign the chart.

23:22.527 --> 23:24.028
I am God,
and God can't hang around.

23:24.112 --> 23:25.947
God has to be in
the gallbladder wing in five."

23:26.030 --> 23:28.199
[laughter]

23:28.282 --> 23:29.909
But spend a few days
in the hospital,

23:29.992 --> 23:32.829
and you start
to notice the nurses.

23:34.580 --> 23:36.791
The nurses never rush
out of your room.

23:37.959 --> 23:42.088
They just clean out
the bedpans, draw the blood,

23:42.171 --> 23:44.298
insert the suppositories.

23:45.508 --> 23:47.760
They don't get to sign a chart.
They don't even get a pen.

23:47.844 --> 23:49.971
But they hold you while you cry.

23:53.224 --> 23:54.684
So, what does this mean?

23:56.018 --> 23:58.771
Are women
more important than God?

23:58.855 --> 24:00.064
Hmm.

24:01.232 --> 24:02.817
What if we discover one day

24:02.900 --> 24:05.111
that we were always
the ones in charge?

24:06.279 --> 24:08.614
Just, no one told us.

24:11.826 --> 24:13.786
I don't know.
I don't know what I'm saying.

24:13.870 --> 24:16.205
I just...

24:16.289 --> 24:18.624
don't want this man to die.

24:25.798 --> 24:27.884
Now, let's see
some tits and ass!

a stage-door Johnny waiting.

24:38.019 --> 24:39.896
What? Where?

24:41.981 --> 24:43.608
Well, this is a surprise.

24:43.691 --> 24:45.776
I was in the neighborhood,
thought I'd stop in.

24:45.860 --> 24:47.695
I heard about the coffee here.

24:47.778 --> 24:50.031
[sighs] Well, nice to see you.

24:50.114 --> 24:51.324
- Wait, just...
- Hey, Lenny.

24:51.407 --> 24:53.409
- Hello.
- Hiya, Lenny.

24:53.492 --> 24:55.244
Nice tie, Leonard.

24:55.328 --> 24:56.913
I know them from Hebrew school.

24:56.996 --> 24:58.331
I really do have to get going.

24:58.414 --> 25:00.833
I saw your show.
It's great stuff.

25:00.917 --> 25:02.835
You made three
construction workers cry.

25:02.919 --> 25:04.086
Thank you.

25:04.170 --> 25:05.880
- You're still mad at me.
- No, I'm not.

25:05.963 --> 25:07.548
I was a complete ass.

25:07.632 --> 25:08.883
I'm very sorry.

25:08.966 --> 25:10.468
I have forgotten all about it.

25:10.551 --> 25:12.678
- You still sound mad.
- Lenny, please.

25:12.762 --> 25:14.096
Midge, you have to forgive me.

25:14.180 --> 25:15.890
There's a performance
of Haydn's "Trumpet Concerto"

25:15.973 --> 25:17.308
with original period instruments

25:17.391 --> 25:18.935
that my buddies
are dying to go to,

25:19.018 --> 25:21.020
but I forced them to come here
just so I could grovel.

25:21.103 --> 25:22.563
They may never speak
to me again.

25:22.647 --> 25:24.565
I saw that concert.
They're not missing much.

25:24.649 --> 25:27.235
Please.

25:31.739 --> 25:34.784
So, Carnegie Hall.

- It's Abe.
- Abe?

36:00.951 --> 36:02.953
- What time is it?
- It's very late.

36:03.036 --> 36:04.746
I have to get to the hospital.

36:04.830 --> 36:06.832
You should go home.

36:06.915 --> 36:08.333
Thank you for your help.

36:08.417 --> 36:10.460
You are a true Sancho Panza.

36:12.462 --> 36:14.756
[woman over P.A.] Phone call
for Dr. O'Connell.

36:14.840 --> 36:18.427
Dr. O'Connell, you have a phone
call at the nurses' station.

36:18.510 --> 36:20.012
I...

36:21.179 --> 36:23.056
What kept you?

36:23.140 --> 36:24.766
I... But you're alive.

36:24.850 --> 36:26.101
I am. Yes.

36:26.184 --> 36:27.436
You're not dead.

36:27.519 --> 36:29.605
No, I'm not.

36:29.688 --> 36:32.399
I just... The call...
I figured...

36:32.482 --> 36:33.734
You hoping
for a different outcome?

36:33.817 --> 36:36.028
No. I'm fine with it, obviously.

36:36.111 --> 36:37.362
I tried to call you.

36:37.446 --> 36:39.781
Some disgruntled employee
rushed me off the phone.

36:39.865 --> 36:43.327
Oh. Well, that's...
terrific, really.

36:43.410 --> 36:46.079
[chuckles] Just surprised.

36:46.163 --> 36:48.081
Who's this? Do I know her?

36:48.165 --> 36:49.374
[Shirley] Oh, this is Mei.

36:49.458 --> 36:50.792
It's so wonderful.

36:50.876 --> 36:53.337
Do you know that now hospitals
hire mah-jongg players

36:53.420 --> 36:55.422
to distract you
from impending death?

36:55.505 --> 36:56.465
- [Abe] Really?
- What?

36:56.548 --> 36:57.716
- She asked. I froze.
- Ah, geez.

36:57.799 --> 36:59.259
She tipped me, though,
so I can pay you back.

36:59.343 --> 37:00.260
That's nice.

37:00.344 --> 37:01.303
What's that, Abe?

37:01.386 --> 37:02.679
- What?
- In your hand.

37:02.763 --> 37:04.389
Oh, it's nothing.

37:04.473 --> 37:05.766
You're holding it very tightly.

37:05.849 --> 37:07.351
It's just, uh...

37:07.434 --> 37:09.311
It says "Moishe's obituary."

37:09.394 --> 37:11.438
- You wrote my obituary?
- No.

37:11.521 --> 37:13.899
You wrote something and
titled it "Moishe's Obituary"?

37:13.982 --> 37:15.108
[Abe sighs] I...

37:15.192 --> 37:16.944
You couldn't get the guy
who wrote Einstein's?

37:17.027 --> 37:18.862
[Abe] No. I just...

37:18.946 --> 37:21.281
Yes. I wrote something.

37:21.365 --> 37:23.659
Well, what were you going to do
rushing in here like that?

37:23.742 --> 37:26.036
- I think I was
going to read it.
- To me?

37:26.119 --> 37:27.454
- Yes.
- While I was unconscious?

37:27.537 --> 37:28.789
Or dead. Yes.

37:28.872 --> 37:31.041
- I'd like to hear it.
- What? No.

37:31.124 --> 37:32.501
- I'm a little curious, too.
- Same here.

37:32.584 --> 37:33.669
You work for the hospital.

37:33.752 --> 37:35.045
- You don't get a vote.
- [Moishe] Abe.

37:35.128 --> 37:37.839
Well, it-it was
just a first draft,

37:37.923 --> 37:40.926
so I hadn't finished it, but...

37:42.344 --> 37:46.223
I just talked about your father
and the pickle cart.

37:46.306 --> 37:47.849
We all know that story.

37:47.933 --> 37:49.142
So, uh...

37:49.226 --> 37:52.145
You started a clothing
manufacturing business.

37:52.229 --> 37:53.897
There was no Roth.

37:53.981 --> 37:55.899
It was all you.
Gave you full credit.

37:55.983 --> 37:57.526
- Thank you.
- [Abe] Oh. Uh,

37:57.609 --> 38:00.696
Moishe brought over
the 13 Jews, saved them.

38:00.779 --> 38:03.699
Very nice paragraph about that.

38:03.782 --> 38:06.743
Good... good placement.
And, uh...

38:06.827 --> 38:09.705
Oh, I found a typo.

38:09.788 --> 38:12.082
I just found another.
Who has a pen?

38:12.165 --> 38:13.583
No one's grading you, Abe.

38:13.667 --> 38:15.377
Yes, well... Okay.

38:15.460 --> 38:19.089
Uh, well, after the 13 Jews,
I-I do a long run

38:19.172 --> 38:21.299
about whether or not God exists.

38:21.383 --> 38:23.093
- He does.
- Well, that's been the debate.

38:23.176 --> 38:24.261
There's no debate. He does.

38:24.344 --> 38:25.971
Okay, I know you feel
like that, but...

38:26.054 --> 38:27.639
Abe, I'm lying
in a hospital bed.

38:27.723 --> 38:28.890
Give me this.

38:30.642 --> 38:32.769
God exists.

38:32.853 --> 38:35.480
For now. And then...

38:35.564 --> 38:40.193
and then I talk about
how you took us in

38:40.277 --> 38:44.072
when we... had nowhere to go.

38:44.156 --> 38:49.786
And... you did not have to,
but you did, and...

38:49.870 --> 38:53.165
you asked us for nothing.

38:54.833 --> 38:59.713
[crying] You made sure
our daughter was taken care of

38:59.796 --> 39:03.467
even though she was not married
to your son anymore.

39:05.052 --> 39:07.220
You...

39:07.304 --> 39:09.806
were a very good man.

39:11.266 --> 39:13.351
And I...

39:13.435 --> 39:15.312
I miss you very much.

39:19.232 --> 39:21.109
But you're not dead, so...

39:24.613 --> 39:27.115
[Shirley] Well,
that was very nice, Abe.

39:27.199 --> 39:29.576
I'm gonna get some ice cream.
Who wants ice cream?

39:29.659 --> 39:31.661
- [Joel] Ice cream sounds good.
- [Rose] Well, I'm going
to get some coffee.

39:31.745 --> 39:33.872
- [Mei] I don't want ice cream.
- [Joel] Just get some
ice cream. Trust me.

39:33.955 --> 39:35.916
- [Mei] Ice cream sounds great.
- [Shirley] You think
the machine will take a 20?

39:35.999 --> 39:37.709
- [Joel] I doubt it.
- [Mei] I have some change.

39:37.793 --> 39:39.503
[Shirley] Since when?
You told me you were broke.

39:39.586 --> 39:42.214
- [Joel] Ma.
- [Rose] Why don't you let me?
- [Shirley groaning]

39:42.297 --> 39:43.840
This is the darndest thing.

39:43.924 --> 39:46.218
I have absolutely no record
of this phone number.

39:46.301 --> 39:47.761
I have no record of this phone.

39:47.844 --> 39:49.387
I don't even recognize
this model.

39:49.471 --> 39:52.015
- Where did you get it again?
- It was here when we got here.

39:52.099 --> 39:53.683
It's the darndest thing.

39:53.767 --> 39:55.602
The guy from Bon Soir says
Alfie has to do

39:55.685 --> 39:57.270
two free shows
before they commit.

39:57.354 --> 39:58.647
Are you kidding me?

39:58.730 --> 40:00.524
Yeah, even I knew
that was a big fuck-you.

40:00.607 --> 40:02.609
Excuse my French.
The phone company called.

40:02.692 --> 40:04.653
They can come out
next Tuesday at 10:00.

40:04.736 --> 40:06.446
The phone company is here.

40:06.530 --> 40:08.949
- Oh. Is the electric
company there?
- No.

40:09.032 --> 40:11.451
The electric company can
come out next Tuesday at 10:00.

40:11.535 --> 40:13.328
- And Marvin Nicholson called...
- [phone ringing]

40:13.411 --> 40:15.205
Ooh, phone. Hold on.

40:15.288 --> 40:16.540
Jesus, Frank.

40:16.623 --> 40:18.166
You leave any garlic
for the rest of the world?

40:18.250 --> 40:19.751
Garlic's good for you.
Makes you strong.

40:19.835 --> 40:22.129
You'll be able to beat up
all the other managers.

40:22.212 --> 40:23.713
Moishe is out of the woods.

40:23.797 --> 40:24.881
- [Frank] Hey.
- Who?

40:24.965 --> 40:26.800
My ex-father-in-law.
He is awake.

40:26.883 --> 40:28.718
Hey, show some enthusiasm.

40:28.802 --> 40:30.387
Why? It's your ex-father-in-law.

40:30.470 --> 40:32.013
I don't give a shit about
your first-grade teacher,

40:32.097 --> 40:33.348
your pediatrician
or the first guy

40:33.431 --> 40:35.350
who felt you up,
either, by the way.

40:35.433 --> 40:37.686
Susie! Hey, I got a weird one.

40:37.769 --> 40:40.438
Yeah, that is not a sentence you
just yell out in public, Maggie.

40:40.522 --> 40:41.857
Just for future reference.

40:41.940 --> 40:44.025
Some guy says he works
for Tony Bennett, and he wants

40:44.109 --> 40:45.902
to talk to you about booking
one of your clients.

40:45.986 --> 40:47.946
[Susie] Really? Tony Bennett?

40:48.029 --> 40:49.531
Well, send it on over.

40:49.614 --> 40:51.616
Tony Bennett. You hear that?

40:51.700 --> 40:54.411
- Tony Bennett's calling me.
- Well, his guy is.

40:54.494 --> 40:56.830
Well, his guy is,
but his guy is calling me

40:56.913 --> 40:59.291
- because Tony Bennett
told him to, so...
- Susie.

41:01.042 --> 41:03.211
- Hold on, Maggie.
- [Maggie] Okay.

41:03.295 --> 41:05.213
I was having a great day
for a minute there.

41:05.297 --> 41:07.257
Lenny put my name in
to open for Tony Bennett

41:07.340 --> 41:08.884
at the Copa this week.

41:08.967 --> 41:10.260
The Copa?

41:10.343 --> 41:11.678
The sold-out run at the Copa?

41:11.761 --> 41:13.763
This... this sold-out run
at the Copa?

41:13.847 --> 41:15.056
That's the one.

41:15.140 --> 41:17.642
Yeah, with the big
full-page ad that says,

41:17.726 --> 41:19.895
"Hello, boys.
This show's a really big deal,

41:19.978 --> 41:21.646
and anyone associated
with this ad

41:21.730 --> 41:23.773
is gonna be rich and famous
and very, very happy."

41:23.857 --> 41:24.900
Bingo.

41:24.983 --> 41:27.194
[both] No opening acts.

41:27.277 --> 41:29.404
Yep. Hang up the phone, Maggie.

41:29.487 --> 41:31.072
- Why?
- I moved.

41:31.156 --> 41:32.574
- Where to?
- I'm dead.

41:32.657 --> 41:35.076
- You are?
- Just hang up
the goddamn phone.

41:35.160 --> 41:36.703
Okay.

41:36.786 --> 41:38.413
Sorry.

41:38.496 --> 41:40.040
No problem.

41:40.123 --> 41:41.583
You want some coffee?

41:41.666 --> 41:43.210
Uh, sure.

41:43.293 --> 41:44.419
Cream?

41:44.502 --> 41:46.463
- Susie, don't.
- Don't what?

41:46.546 --> 41:48.340
Okay, no cream.

41:48.423 --> 41:49.758
You know my situation.

41:49.841 --> 41:52.260
Sugar? Yeah, you like it sweet.

41:52.344 --> 41:54.221
Let me put some sugar
in there for you.

41:54.304 --> 41:56.681
- [Midge] This is creepy.
- [Frank] That was
really Tony Bennett?

41:56.765 --> 41:58.350
Yes, but I'm not doing op...

41:58.433 --> 42:00.644
Let it go, Frank. It's
a brick wall in a pink tutu.

42:00.727 --> 42:02.270
Susie, do you know if,
at any point,

42:02.354 --> 42:04.147
this whole building
used to be somewhere else?

42:04.231 --> 42:05.732
I'm gonna go with no.

42:05.815 --> 42:07.943
- The building
has not been moved.
- You know, Midge,

42:08.026 --> 42:09.778
that Bennett gig seems
like a big opportunity.

42:09.861 --> 42:11.780
You might want to give it
a second thought.

42:11.863 --> 42:13.281
Thanks, Frank.
Susie and I have a plan.

42:13.365 --> 42:14.699
Is the plan to open
for Tony Bennett?

42:14.783 --> 42:15.909
'Cause that sounds
like a good plan.

42:15.992 --> 42:17.661
It's not, but thanks for asking.

42:17.744 --> 42:18.912
Tony Bennett is a great singer.

42:18.995 --> 42:20.163
You would work nice with him.

42:20.247 --> 42:21.373
I would.

42:21.456 --> 42:23.041
I'm not gonna, but I would.

42:23.124 --> 42:26.044
[Nicky] Miriam, as friends
of yours and Susie's...

42:26.127 --> 42:28.004
I'd say more like family
than friends at this point.

42:28.088 --> 42:29.631
We're just looking out
for your well-being.

42:29.714 --> 42:31.132
You should consider
changing your mind.

42:31.216 --> 42:32.509
And then you should
change your mind.

42:32.592 --> 42:34.469
He won't give us a line
till he tracks down

42:34.552 --> 42:36.012
the origins of this phone.

42:36.096 --> 42:38.223
Hey, Dinah, stir the sauce.

42:39.641 --> 42:41.643
- Two lines, right?
- Yes, please.

42:43.103 --> 42:44.813
Don't open the door.

42:47.774 --> 42:49.776
Can I talk to you a minute?

42:54.030 --> 42:55.657
Why are they suddenly
always around?

42:55.740 --> 42:57.575
- Who?
- Martini and Rossi.

42:57.659 --> 42:59.494
I don't know.
They're just hanging out.

42:59.577 --> 43:01.329
Here. They are hanging out here.

43:01.413 --> 43:03.415
Yes, here. They got this place
for me, remember?

43:03.498 --> 43:05.750
They found the furniture for me.
They suggested the layout.

43:05.834 --> 43:07.627
- Why?
- Why?

43:07.711 --> 43:09.629
'Cause it's not obvious
to the eye, Miriam.

43:09.713 --> 43:11.256
It's a lot
of fucking space to fill.

43:11.339 --> 43:13.466
Susie, think. Why did they
do all this for you?

43:13.550 --> 43:15.051
'Cause you're just
so fun to be around?

43:15.135 --> 43:16.428
Fuck you. I am fun.

43:16.511 --> 43:18.596
These guys aren't pals
with people without a catch.

43:18.680 --> 43:20.098
What's the catch?

43:21.141 --> 43:22.183
What do you care?

43:24.561 --> 43:26.021
They said something
about a taste.

43:26.104 --> 43:28.273
- A taste of what?
- Okay, you need to relax.

43:28.356 --> 43:29.482
These guys are mobsters.

43:29.566 --> 43:31.484
Hey, I know what they are, okay?

43:31.568 --> 43:33.820
They kidnapped me
for a night, if you remember.

43:33.903 --> 43:35.989
What are they getting
a taste of?

43:36.072 --> 43:37.907
Look, they did a favor for me.

43:37.991 --> 43:40.452
Someday, I will do a favor
for them. That's how it works.

43:40.535 --> 43:43.621
What favor? You have nothing
to give guys who want a favor.

43:43.705 --> 43:45.874
- I have, too.
- I am the favor.

43:45.957 --> 43:47.375
Okay. We are done here.

43:47.459 --> 43:49.044
Susie, please listen to me.

43:49.127 --> 43:51.087
Boy, I have to tell you,
one thing I am

43:51.171 --> 43:54.174
very tired of doing right now,
Miriam, is listening to you.

43:55.216 --> 43:57.927
[♪ Dinah Shore: "Shoo Fly Pie
and Apple Pan Dowdy"]

43:58.011 --> 43:59.596
[door slams]

44:05.143 --> 44:06.603
[Abe] Moishe, careful.

44:06.686 --> 44:08.438
- There's a step.
- There's a step here, Moishe.

44:08.521 --> 44:09.856
Right here. Watch the step.

44:09.939 --> 44:11.983
Shirley, I have the onions.

44:12.067 --> 44:13.693
- Slow down, Pop.
- I am.

44:13.777 --> 44:15.737
- I said slow down.
- I go any slower,

44:15.820 --> 44:17.489
technically,
I will have stopped.

44:17.572 --> 44:19.657
- Pop, please.
- Joel, I love you.

44:19.741 --> 44:21.659
You're my son. Now, fuck off.

44:21.743 --> 44:23.536
Zelda's a genius.
She's got everything arranged.

44:23.620 --> 44:25.205
Your bedroom's down here.

44:25.288 --> 44:27.082
- The dining room's in there.
- This is silly.

44:27.165 --> 44:28.917
I'm on display here
like a prize pig.

44:29.000 --> 44:30.752
The third doctor
from the right said no stairs.

44:30.835 --> 44:32.504
That's the fourth doctor
from the left.

44:32.587 --> 44:34.672
Third doctor from the right,
fourth doctor from the left

44:34.756 --> 44:36.549
is the same doctor, by the way.

44:36.633 --> 44:38.760
And this is from the man
that was dead a few days ago.

44:38.843 --> 44:40.261
Let's get you in bed,
Mr. Moishe.

44:40.345 --> 44:42.055
Just a minute.
I need to talk to Joely.

44:42.138 --> 44:44.891
Wow. That's a sailor's grip
you got there.

44:44.974 --> 44:46.810
Okay. I'm on the bed.

44:46.893 --> 44:48.770
I'm sitting very still.
I'm not eating salt.

44:48.853 --> 44:50.563
Can I talk to my son
for a moment?

44:50.647 --> 44:52.315
- Of course.
- Listen.

44:53.400 --> 44:55.777
I need to say something here.

44:55.860 --> 44:58.530
On the night of... the thing,
you were telling me about...

44:58.613 --> 44:59.906
Pop, we don't have to do this.

44:59.989 --> 45:01.449
I want you to know I heard you.

45:01.533 --> 45:03.118
I heard everything you said.

45:03.201 --> 45:06.413
Now, I will admit that
the timing does seem suspicious,

45:06.496 --> 45:10.667
but I need to make it very clear
that I did not have the thing

45:10.750 --> 45:13.461
- because you told me
about your girlfriend.
- You didn't?

45:13.545 --> 45:15.171
I do not care
that she is Chinese.

45:15.255 --> 45:17.215
- Do I need to repeat this?
- No.

45:17.298 --> 45:18.716
I am surprised
that she's pregnant,

45:18.800 --> 45:20.385
but you have two kids
and a zipper,

45:20.468 --> 45:22.804
so not totally unexpected.

45:22.887 --> 45:24.806
Plus, it's one more chance
to name someone

45:24.889 --> 45:26.224
after my Grandmother Helda.

45:26.307 --> 45:27.392
No, it's not.

45:27.475 --> 45:29.602
You love her.
You're going to marry her,

45:29.686 --> 45:31.479
have a family,
another grandchild.

45:31.563 --> 45:32.772
That's a mitzvah.

45:32.856 --> 45:35.150
- That, we celebrate.
- Thank you, Pop.

45:35.233 --> 45:37.569
However, she has to be Jewish by
the time you tell your mother.

45:37.652 --> 45:39.612
- What?
- It's easy. She meets a rabbi,

45:39.696 --> 45:40.864
reads a book, takes a bath.

45:40.947 --> 45:43.700
- Pop.
- I'm getting very weak, Joel.

45:43.783 --> 45:45.368
Try not to upset me.

45:45.452 --> 45:47.078
Zelda made her beef tea, Moishe.

45:47.162 --> 45:48.538
- Drink up.
- Ooh, ooh, ooh.

45:48.621 --> 45:50.498

[announcer] Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

47:39.482 --> 47:41.776
It gives me a great deal
of pleasure to welcome you

47:41.859 --> 47:45.029
to this performance of
Lenny Bruce at Carnegie Hall.

47:45.113 --> 47:48.241
The one thing I'd like to say
about the label

47:48.324 --> 47:50.743
of "sick comedian,"
which I think...

47:50.827 --> 47:52.453
[sighs] Is there
anyone out there?

47:52.537 --> 47:54.205
I don't know, man.
Go out there and look.

47:54.289 --> 47:56.040
No, I'm not gonna
go out there and look.

47:56.124 --> 47:58.042
Does it matter?
Will it change anything?

47:58.126 --> 47:59.669
It's fine.
I'll just go out there

47:59.752 --> 48:02.005
and entertain whatever junkie
wandered in from Times Square.

48:02.088 --> 48:03.756
Won't be the first time.

48:03.840 --> 48:07.343
[announcer] ...but that
Lenny Bruce comments, reflects,

48:07.427 --> 48:09.971
holds up the mirror,
so to speak,

48:10.054 --> 48:12.890
to the sick elements
in our society

48:12.974 --> 48:16.853
that should be reflected upon
and that should be spoken about.

48:16.936 --> 48:18.938
[audience applauding]

48:21.357 --> 48:23.735
And so at this time,

48:23.818 --> 48:25.153
Lenny Bruce.

48:25.236 --> 48:26.779
- [applause]
- Shit.

Cool it. Like, um... [chuckles]

48:48.343 --> 48:53.389
I wasn't doing a milking bit,
but it's ridiculous, man.

48:53.473 --> 48:55.475
- Hee-hee!
- [laughter]

48:55.558 --> 48:58.186
You should dig
my point of view here, man.

48:59.228 --> 49:02.357
You know, uh, working
Carnegie Hall is like, uh...

49:02.440 --> 49:04.067
I dig it, you know.

49:04.150 --> 49:05.610
- It's like a...
- [chuckling]

49:05.693 --> 49:08.655
But it's a... I had a lot
of fantasies with it, you know.

49:08.738 --> 49:10.073
Uh, two great fantasies.

49:10.156 --> 49:12.283
Uh, one, he introduces me

49:12.367 --> 49:15.078
and I come out with a violin
and I just cook, man.

49:15.161 --> 49:17.038
- [spluttering]
- [laughter]

49:17.121 --> 49:18.289
But for an hour, man.

- [spluttering]
- [laughter]

49:19.582 --> 49:21.417
Every Stravinsky. Heavy like...

49:21.501 --> 49:23.294
- [spluttering]
- [laughter]

49:23.378 --> 49:26.214
And I don't say a word, zugnish,
and I split, you know.

49:26.297 --> 49:27.840
You go, "What was that, man?"

49:27.924 --> 49:31.552
"I don't know. It was a concert
and he played a violin."

49:31.636 --> 49:32.970
"He didn't do any bits?"

49:33.054 --> 49:35.723
"No, man, he just wailed
his ass off with a violin."

49:35.807 --> 49:36.766
Yeah.

49:36.849 --> 49:38.226
- [laughter, applause]
- Excuse me.

49:38.309 --> 49:39.811
Excuse me. Pardon me.

49:39.894 --> 49:41.145
Excu...

49:43.189 --> 49:46.317
Okay. Now, number two fantasy
is that, uh--

49:46.401 --> 49:48.403
as this is the 12:00 scene--

49:48.486 --> 49:50.655
uh, maybe the people
who own this place

49:50.738 --> 49:53.157
- don't even know we're here.
- [laughter]

49:53.241 --> 49:55.159
Right? Yeah.

49:55.243 --> 49:57.995
You get a guy who's
like a-a good corrupt janitor.

49:58.079 --> 49:59.872
You know? "Uh, all right,
but don't make no noise

49:59.956 --> 50:01.290
and clean up
after you're finished."

50:01.374 --> 50:02.375
[laughter, applause]

50:02.458 --> 50:04.627
Okay. Okay, dig.

50:07.630 --> 50:11.884
So now you've got
a dopey cliché like, uh,

50:11.968 --> 50:14.929
"Would you want your sister
to marry one of them?"

50:15.012 --> 50:17.432
Which, see, has...
there's no logic there, see.

50:17.515 --> 50:20.101
Because you got to tell me
which sister, which one of them.

50:20.184 --> 50:21.686
[laughter]

50:21.769 --> 50:24.897
Because if I talk to a member
of the Ku Klux Klan and I say,

50:24.981 --> 50:27.233
"Uh, let's see,
you're, uh, 35 years old,

50:27.316 --> 50:31.195
you're unmarried, you're white,
you're an attractive man.

50:31.279 --> 50:34.824
I'm gonna give you a choice--
own free will--

50:34.907 --> 50:38.161
of marrying a Black woman
or a white woman.

50:38.244 --> 50:41.789
Two chicks, about the same ages,
same economic level,

50:41.873 --> 50:43.332
and you make the choice.

50:43.416 --> 50:45.585
But you got to marry her.
Whatever marriage means to you.

50:45.668 --> 50:48.087
Kissing and hugging
and sleeping in a single bed

50:48.171 --> 50:50.214
- on hot nights.

Fifteen years
with a Black, Black woman

50:52.884 --> 50:54.719
or 15 years
with a white, white woman.

50:54.802 --> 50:56.929
Kissing and hugging
that Black, Black woman

50:57.013 --> 50:58.431
or the white one.

50:58.514 --> 51:01.559
You make your choice between the
Black woman or the white woman.

51:01.642 --> 51:03.186
The white woman...

51:03.269 --> 51:04.771
is Kate Smith.

51:04.854 --> 51:07.231
[laughter, applause]

51:07.315 --> 51:09.442
The Black woman

51:09.525 --> 51:10.943
- is Lena Horne.
- [cheering]

51:11.027 --> 51:13.154
So, then you are not concerned

51:13.237 --> 51:15.740
with Black or white anymore,
are you?"

51:17.867 --> 51:19.869
I don't know if there's
any losers out here.

51:19.952 --> 51:21.829
[laughter]

51:21.913 --> 51:23.664
You know, when you break up
with your old lady,

51:23.748 --> 51:26.250
uh, get divorced,
uh, here's the problem.

51:26.334 --> 51:27.668
I don't know
if you'll encounter it.

51:27.752 --> 51:29.587
It's particularly
a show business problem,

51:29.670 --> 51:32.006
but, uh... because of my hours.

51:32.089 --> 51:34.342
I'm not a particularly
promiscuous person,

51:34.425 --> 51:37.094
but I like to have someone,
you know, to hang out with,

51:37.178 --> 51:38.888
- to talk to.
- [laughter]

51:38.971 --> 51:42.058
Usually, I go out with chicks
that are between 30 and 40,

51:42.141 --> 51:43.976
because they're usually divorced

51:44.060 --> 51:45.520
and good and bitter, too,
you know.

51:45.603 --> 51:46.562
[laughter]

51:46.646 --> 51:48.439
But the hang-up is,

51:48.523 --> 51:51.150
where can you go
at 4:00 in the morning?

51:51.234 --> 51:52.777
And every chick I know
who's divorced

51:52.860 --> 51:54.570
- has got a seven-year-old kid.
- [laughter]

51:54.654 --> 51:56.739
If they haven't got
a seven-year-old kid,

51:56.823 --> 51:59.575
they've got a mother who lives
with them who's divorced, too.

51:59.659 --> 52:02.245
- [laughter]
- And those kinds of mothers
are real nuts.

52:02.328 --> 52:04.580
You know, complete competition
with their daughters.

52:04.664 --> 52:07.750
"Oh, you think I got nice legs?
I was a Charleston dancer."

52:07.834 --> 52:08.876
[laughter, applause]

52:08.960 --> 52:11.170
Yeah. [chuckles] Yeah.

52:11.254 --> 52:13.422
And so the hang-up is,

52:13.506 --> 52:16.008
at 4:00 in the morning,
where you gonna...

52:16.092 --> 52:19.554
If you say, uh, "motel,"
semantics, that's out.

52:19.637 --> 52:21.556
Yeah.

52:21.639 --> 52:24.100
Really. It's got, like,
a lewd connotation.

52:24.183 --> 52:27.270
So, I figured all kinds
of devices, like, uh,

52:27.353 --> 52:29.480
I tell a chick "a trailer."

52:29.564 --> 52:31.566
- [laughter]
- That sounds cute, right?

52:31.649 --> 52:33.150
Nothing dirty about trailers.

52:33.234 --> 52:35.111
"Hey, want to go to my trailer?"

52:35.194 --> 52:37.113
"Yeah, okay. Where is it?"

52:37.196 --> 52:39.490
"Well, it's
in my motel room now."

52:39.574 --> 52:40.908
[laughter]

52:40.992 --> 52:43.244
"Yeah.
I'll help you assemble it."

52:43.327 --> 52:44.662
[chuckles]

52:47.206 --> 52:50.334
This one chick, oh,
I kind of dug her, you know?

52:50.418 --> 52:53.838
Uh, I known her a couple years,
seen her after work.

52:53.921 --> 52:57.174
And, uh, we're sitting there
outside of the motel,

52:57.258 --> 52:59.343
and, uh, she says,
"All right, look.

52:59.427 --> 53:00.761
I don't want to go in there.

53:00.845 --> 53:02.305
I don't want to be embarrassed
with the registering

53:02.388 --> 53:03.514
and all that. You go in."

53:03.598 --> 53:04.974
I say, "All right. Solid.

53:05.057 --> 53:06.183
You stay in the car."

53:06.267 --> 53:08.352
- [laughter]
- So, I go in.

53:08.436 --> 53:10.354
Uh, "Hello."

53:10.438 --> 53:12.398
"Hello. Um...

53:12.481 --> 53:14.358
How much is it here a month?"

53:14.442 --> 53:16.444
- [laughter]
- "Well, we just got
a daily rate.

53:16.527 --> 53:17.653
Six dollars."

53:17.737 --> 53:19.155
"Uh... [clears throat]

53:19.238 --> 53:20.573
I'll tell you what.

53:20.656 --> 53:21.699
Uh... [clears throat]

53:21.782 --> 53:24.702
My sister's out in the car,
and, uh...

53:24.785 --> 53:26.579
we had a terrible tragedy
in our family.

53:26.662 --> 53:28.080
My uncle passed away.

53:28.164 --> 53:30.666
And I don't know if you've
ever had a tragedy like that.

53:30.750 --> 53:32.710
Uh, we were very close
to him, in fact.

53:32.793 --> 53:35.755
And, uh, she's all shook up.
She's under sedation.

53:35.838 --> 53:37.506
- She's just hysterical.
- [laughter]

53:37.590 --> 53:40.092
So, I'm gonna sleep with her."

53:40.176 --> 53:42.219
[laughter, applause]

53:42.303 --> 53:44.305
[cheering]

53:47.850 --> 53:49.644
Time to split.

53:49.727 --> 53:51.354
Grab a shovel and go home.

53:51.437 --> 53:52.355
Thank you.

53:52.438 --> 53:54.941
[cheering, applause]

54:14.126 --> 54:15.628
- [indistinct chatter]
- Excuse me.

54:15.711 --> 54:18.881
Excuse me.
Ooh, sorry if that was a foot!

54:18.965 --> 54:21.133
- Ah! Ha! There she is.
- [giggles]

54:21.217 --> 54:23.886
Everyone, this is Midge Maisel.

54:23.970 --> 54:25.554
Mrs., to those in the know.

54:25.638 --> 54:27.181
Hey, hey, hey,
how's your father-in-law?

54:27.264 --> 54:29.225
He's fine, actually.
He's gonna recover.

54:29.308 --> 54:30.893
Oh, thank God.
We were in a panic all evening.

54:30.977 --> 54:32.103
Uh, can you all excuse me?

54:32.186 --> 54:34.271
I have to talk to this lady
for a moment.

54:34.355 --> 54:36.190
[indistinct chatter]

54:36.273 --> 54:40.361
Lenny, you were
insanely great tonight.

54:40.444 --> 54:42.154
Really.

54:42.238 --> 54:45.992
The people around me
never wanted you to stop.

54:46.075 --> 54:47.368
Might've wanted you to slow down

54:47.451 --> 54:49.745
if they were following you
like this.

54:49.829 --> 54:50.746
Lenny.

54:50.830 --> 54:52.373
Little tip:
the nicer the lady looks,

54:52.456 --> 54:54.291
the worse her shoes are.

54:59.380 --> 55:01.048
Wow.

55:01.132 --> 55:03.676
This is amazing.

55:03.759 --> 55:05.344
How did it feel?

55:05.428 --> 55:08.472
How did it feel? Uh...

55:08.556 --> 55:10.850
It felt great.

55:10.933 --> 55:12.685
Been here before
to see concerts,

55:12.768 --> 55:15.563
but out in the audience,
obviously.

55:15.646 --> 55:17.648
I hear you turned down
the Bennett gig.

55:17.732 --> 55:19.650
Yeah.

55:19.734 --> 55:21.068
I did.

55:21.152 --> 55:23.195
Said you wouldn't even
come to the phone.

55:23.279 --> 55:26.323
Well, that was more Susie,
but yes.

55:26.407 --> 55:28.242
Okay.

55:28.325 --> 55:29.452
Let's put aside for a moment

55:29.535 --> 55:31.203
that I went to bat for you
for that job.

55:31.287 --> 55:33.539
I mean, really, I turned down
their price three times.

55:33.622 --> 55:34.832
"No, she can't work for that.

55:34.915 --> 55:36.000
Do you have any idea
what you're getting here?"

55:36.083 --> 55:37.501
That's on me.

55:37.585 --> 55:39.211
You didn't ask me to do that,
so I'm the schmuck there.

55:39.295 --> 55:41.881
- Lenny...
- But I couldn't
really figure out why.

55:41.964 --> 55:43.090
So I asked around.

55:43.174 --> 55:44.508
I don't know.

55:44.592 --> 55:46.093
Were you being
blacklisted again?

55:46.177 --> 55:47.762
Did the Baldwin thing
hurt you that much?

55:47.845 --> 55:49.096
I'm at Carnegie Hall.

55:49.180 --> 55:51.098
I've got five minutes
where maybe I can help you

55:51.182 --> 55:53.517
before I'm thrown out
of the club again.

55:53.601 --> 55:55.561
But then I heard that
you were turning down gigs

55:55.644 --> 55:57.271
right and left.

55:57.354 --> 55:59.815
I made a decision
to do things my way.

55:59.899 --> 56:01.692
I'm sorry, what does that mean?

56:01.776 --> 56:05.488
It means I just want to say
what I want to say.

56:05.571 --> 56:06.864
Why am I explaining this to you?

56:06.947 --> 56:10.201
Why? Because my fucking mind
is blown, that's why.

56:10.284 --> 56:11.452
I don't understand.

56:11.535 --> 56:13.370
No opening act gigs.

56:13.454 --> 56:14.830
- Yes.
- That's true?

56:14.914 --> 56:15.831
Yes, that's true.

56:15.915 --> 56:17.833
I told you about the manifesto.

56:17.917 --> 56:19.627
Do you understand
that this is a business?

56:19.710 --> 56:21.962
Like anything else--
you get hired, you get paid.

56:22.046 --> 56:24.173
- You understand that?
- Yes, but...

56:24.256 --> 56:26.258
And the trick is
to get good and get paid.

56:26.342 --> 56:27.593
I get paid at the Wolford.

56:27.676 --> 56:29.553
Oh, come on.
One thing you are not is dumb.

56:29.637 --> 56:32.306
Wait a minute.
You never compromise.

56:32.389 --> 56:35.184
You get up onstage knowing the
police could be there, or, hell,

56:35.267 --> 56:36.769
that they are there, and you say

56:36.852 --> 56:39.021
whatever the hell it is
you want anyhow.

56:39.105 --> 56:40.272
Why is it wrong for me
to want to do

56:40.356 --> 56:42.024
- the very same thing?
- Jesus Christ, Midge.

56:42.108 --> 56:44.401
What a fucking pedestal
you put me on.

56:45.736 --> 56:48.072
Getting arrested
is not a badge of honor.

56:48.155 --> 56:50.658
Getting arrested means I can't
work where I want to work.

56:50.741 --> 56:52.827
People are afraid of booking me.

56:52.910 --> 56:55.538
It's exactly the opposite
of what I want for myself.

56:55.621 --> 56:57.873
- But...
- Do you know how much
I hate knowing that half

56:57.957 --> 57:00.334
the people that come to see me
are hoping I'm gonna get popped?

57:00.417 --> 57:02.503
Hoping they'll have some great
story to tell their friends

57:02.586 --> 57:04.255
over cheese and crackers?

57:04.338 --> 57:06.298
I want people to fucking laugh.

57:06.382 --> 57:08.634
Think and laugh, sure,
but laugh.

57:08.717 --> 57:09.969
I'm a comic.

57:10.052 --> 57:11.262
An entertainer.

57:11.345 --> 57:12.888
Baggy pants, banana peels.

57:12.972 --> 57:15.474
I'm not the stand-up messiah.

57:15.558 --> 57:18.394
This is what I want.

57:18.477 --> 57:20.271
This is what I have worked for.

57:20.354 --> 57:21.814
Don't you want this?

57:21.897 --> 57:23.899
Don't you want to be here?

57:23.983 --> 57:26.235
Don't you want to know
a thousand mental patients

57:26.318 --> 57:28.404
braved a fucking snowstorm
to see you?

57:28.487 --> 57:30.948
- That should be the goal.
- How do you know it's not?

57:31.031 --> 57:32.575
Because you're not
gonna get here

57:32.658 --> 57:35.161
hiding yourself away in a club
that technically doesn't exist.

57:35.244 --> 57:37.955
- I'm not hiding.
- You sure as fuck are hiding.

57:38.998 --> 57:40.207
So what you got dumped
by Baldwin?

57:40.291 --> 57:41.750
Who gives a shit?
Go get another gig.

57:41.834 --> 57:42.751
And another and another.

57:42.835 --> 57:44.587
So I'm just supposed
to get fired

57:44.670 --> 57:45.796
from one job after another?

57:45.880 --> 57:48.090
Yes. If that's what it takes.

57:48.174 --> 57:50.551
Listen to me.

57:50.634 --> 57:51.969
I have made a lot of mistakes

57:52.052 --> 57:53.554
and I am gonna keep making
a lot of mistakes,

57:53.637 --> 57:55.681
but one thing
is crystal clear in my mind

57:55.764 --> 57:57.266
and it's what the endgame is.

57:57.349 --> 57:59.351
Oh, really? So that's
what the bag in your...

57:59.435 --> 58:01.854
No. Do not make this about me.

58:01.937 --> 58:03.480
This is about you.

58:03.564 --> 58:06.650
You wanted me to remember
you're funny, right?

58:06.734 --> 58:08.485
That night?

58:08.569 --> 58:10.321
You didn't want me
to think of you as just a girl.

58:10.404 --> 58:12.948
You wanted me
to think of you as a comic.

58:13.032 --> 58:15.659
Well, don't you forget
that I'm a comic, too.

58:15.743 --> 58:17.494
Don't you dare look at me
as someone to be pitied

58:17.578 --> 58:18.829
or helped or fixed.

58:18.913 --> 58:21.207
I do not want or need that,
especially from you.

58:21.290 --> 58:23.375
- I don't want to fix you.
- Ninety percent of this game

58:23.459 --> 58:25.878
is how they see you.

58:25.961 --> 58:27.671
They see you hanging
with Tony Bennett,

58:27.755 --> 58:29.256
they think
you deserve to be there.

58:29.340 --> 58:30.507
They see you hauled off to jail

58:30.591 --> 58:32.176
for saying "fuck"
at a strip club,

58:32.259 --> 58:33.761
they think
you deserve that also.

58:33.844 --> 58:35.721
Wise up.

58:38.015 --> 58:39.516
I'm not hiding.

58:39.600 --> 58:40.684
I have a plan.

58:40.768 --> 58:42.228
Don't plan!

58:42.311 --> 58:43.979
Work.

58:44.063 --> 58:46.398
Just work and keep working.

58:47.524 --> 58:49.777
There is a moment
in this business,

58:49.860 --> 58:51.362
window's open.

58:51.445 --> 58:53.197
If you miss it, it closes.

58:53.280 --> 58:54.323
Just don't...

58:58.494 --> 59:01.163
If you blow this, Midge,
I swear...

59:09.296 --> 59:12.049
...you will break
my fucking heart.
