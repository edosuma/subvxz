- FEE: You touch it.
- I'm not gonna touch it.

00:34.968 --> 00:37.303
Who knows how many germs
are on that thing?

00:39.906 --> 00:41.674
- A whole lot of germs.

00:41.741 --> 00:43.877
- So is it dead or what?

00:43.943 --> 00:44.878
- [sniffs]

00:44.944 --> 00:46.513
It's a tail.

00:46.579 --> 00:48.648
I can tell because this end
smells like butt.

00:48.715 --> 00:50.817
- Ew.
- Kiss it. Kiss it. Kiss it.

00:50.884 --> 00:52.585
- Get that thing away from me.

00:52.652 --> 00:54.954
- Let me see that.

00:55.021 --> 00:57.023
Cool. It still works.

01:00.460 --> 01:02.328
Ha!

01:05.565 --> 01:06.833
You okay, dude?

01:06.900 --> 01:08.835
- I think my legs are broken.

01:08.902 --> 01:11.237
Wait, no, they're just dirty.

01:11.304 --> 01:14.307
- Who knew having a tail
would be this cool?

01:14.374 --> 01:18.278
It's like the best thing
that's ever happened to my butt.

01:21.047 --> 01:23.216
- [muttering]

01:36.863 --> 01:39.098
- Oh, this? It's my new bangs.

01:39.165 --> 01:40.333
Thanks for noticing.

01:40.400 --> 01:44.471
See how they sway in the wind.

01:44.537 --> 01:48.007
- Ha ha. It's funny,
'cause it's like your hair,

01:48.074 --> 01:49.742
but it's not really your hair.

01:49.809 --> 01:52.011
- Foo, go find some more stuff
for us to knock down.

01:52.078 --> 01:53.246
- Okey-dokey.

02:00.019 --> 02:01.654
I'm strong.

02:01.721 --> 02:04.958
Wait, I'm supposed
to find stuff to knock over.

02:05.024 --> 02:07.460
Nope, too rocky.

02:07.527 --> 02:09.195
Too tree-y.

02:09.262 --> 02:11.197
Wait, I already tried this.

02:13.933 --> 02:16.102
Haha.

02:16.870 --> 02:18.538
Whoa.

02:18.605 --> 02:21.541
- Just spin the tail really fast
like a propeller.

02:21.608 --> 02:24.878
- Got it.

02:24.944 --> 02:26.479
Did it work?

02:26.546 --> 02:29.549
- Heck yeah.
It totally slowed your fall.

02:29.616 --> 02:31.284
Looks like a nut.

02:31.351 --> 02:32.919
There's something inside.

02:32.986 --> 02:34.787
- Yeah, nut guts.

02:34.854 --> 02:36.055
- Whoa.

02:36.122 --> 02:37.690
{\an8}It's a tiny note.

02:37.757 --> 02:39.092
{\an8}I wonder who...

02:41.594 --> 02:42.862
{\an8}- Well, don't read it.

02:42.929 --> 02:44.764
- Why not?

02:44.831 --> 02:46.399
- 'Cause you always use that
weird voice when you read stuff.

02:46.466 --> 02:48.568
- I do not use a weird voice.

02:48.635 --> 02:51.204
Okay, fine.
I'll just read to myself then.

02:53.840 --> 02:55.008
Oh, my gosh!

02:55.074 --> 02:56.976
You won't believe what it says!

02:57.043 --> 02:58.111
- What?

02:58.177 --> 02:59.546
- [creepy voice]
We have your brother.

02:59.612 --> 03:00.713
Give us back--

03:00.780 --> 03:02.315
- Right there.
You're doing the weird voice.

03:02.382 --> 03:04.050
- You're missing the point.

03:04.117 --> 03:06.085
It says the tail
belongs to the squirrels.

03:06.152 --> 03:07.987
And if they don't get it back,

03:08.054 --> 03:10.089
they're gonna do
something bad to Foo.

03:10.156 --> 03:13.059
- What? I gotta--
I gotta find him.

03:13.126 --> 03:14.761
I'm coming for ya, Foo.

03:14.827 --> 03:17.297
- Fee, wait. We just gotta
give 'em back the tail.

03:17.363 --> 03:19.265
- I'm not giving them my tail.

03:19.332 --> 03:22.168
They have no right
to take it from me

03:22.235 --> 03:26.072
just like they had no right
to take my brother!

03:26.139 --> 03:29.876
They both belong to me!

03:29.943 --> 03:31.110
Aah!

03:31.177 --> 03:33.813
They made me go blind with rage.

03:33.880 --> 03:36.783
Aah! You stupid tree rats.

03:36.849 --> 03:38.451
When I get my--

03:41.187 --> 03:44.257
Uh... What the-- Harvey!

03:44.324 --> 03:46.593
Some stupid moron tied me up.

03:46.659 --> 03:48.227
- Hey, I tied you up.

03:48.294 --> 03:50.263
Since you're a little too...

03:50.330 --> 03:52.865
emotionally charged,
why don't I go

03:52.932 --> 03:55.301
talk to the squirrels
and defuse this whole thing?

03:55.368 --> 03:57.570
- You can't talk
to those nut crunchers.

03:57.637 --> 04:00.573
The only thing they understand
is me beating their heads in.

04:00.640 --> 04:02.775
- No,
we can do this without violence.

04:02.842 --> 04:06.045
I'm pretty sure
I'm a really good negotiator.

04:06.112 --> 04:07.814
Just stay put, okay.

04:07.880 --> 04:11.284
{\an8}Here's a bottle of water
so you won't get dehydrated.

04:11.351 --> 04:13.319
{\an8}Uh...I'll be back soon, okay?

04:13.386 --> 04:16.689
- Harvey, get back
here and untie me.

04:16.755 --> 04:19.325
Hang on, Foo.

04:19.392 --> 04:21.894
Nothing's going to stop me
from saving you.

04:21.961 --> 04:23.329
Whoa.

04:23.396 --> 04:25.398
- So hello everyone.

04:25.465 --> 04:27.600
My name is Harvey Beaks
and I'm here

04:27.667 --> 04:30.570
to negotiate a deal
that will help all of us.

04:30.637 --> 04:32.805
- Hey, Harvey, the squirrels
are having a party,

04:32.872 --> 04:35.208
except there's no music
and they just tie you up.

04:35.274 --> 04:37.110
I'm just waiting
for the pizza to arrive.

04:37.176 --> 04:39.078
- I told you, there's no pizza.

04:39.145 --> 04:40.880
- Cool.

04:40.947 --> 04:43.116
First, let's go around the room
and introduce ourselves.

04:43.182 --> 04:45.385
Like I said. My name's Harvey.

04:45.451 --> 04:48.454
I like ice cream,
especially mint chocolate chip.

04:48.521 --> 04:52.091
And I like sunsets and I
like my mom and dad.

04:52.158 --> 04:53.960
They're really great.

04:54.027 --> 04:55.628
Okay, who's next?

04:55.695 --> 04:56.896
- I'm Foo.

04:56.963 --> 04:57.997
I'm tied up.

04:58.064 --> 04:59.232
- I am Jean-Luc.

04:59.298 --> 05:02.001
This is Jean-Claude, Sean-Jean.

05:02.068 --> 05:03.936
Billi-Jean.

05:04.003 --> 05:07.006
Long-Jean. And our leader
Papa-Jean,

05:07.073 --> 05:10.410
who you are currently
sitting on.

05:10.476 --> 05:12.278
- Oh, my gosh. I'm so sorry.

05:12.345 --> 05:14.080
I thought he was a beanbag.

05:14.147 --> 05:15.748
- [muttering]

05:17.283 --> 05:18.718
- Enough chitty-chats!

05:18.785 --> 05:20.019
Did you bring the tail?

05:20.086 --> 05:23.156
- No, but I think that-- Oh.

05:23.222 --> 05:27.093
- Then we are done
with the negotiating.

05:27.160 --> 05:28.528
- Whoa!

05:35.134 --> 05:36.703
Aah!

05:36.769 --> 05:39.872
- Who's dumb idea
was this scavenger hunt?

05:39.939 --> 05:42.141
Crafts, you find
any good leaves?

05:42.208 --> 05:44.210
- Who can tell?
They all look the same.

05:44.277 --> 05:46.979
- Uh, this hurts my brain.

05:47.046 --> 05:48.548
Crafts, are you okay?

05:48.614 --> 05:51.317
- I think a tree just
threw up all over me.

05:51.384 --> 05:54.187
- Wait a minute. That's Fee.

05:54.253 --> 05:56.155
- Don't leave her on me!
She might eat me.

05:56.222 --> 06:01.294
- Okay, hang on. Oy. Oy.

06:01.360 --> 06:04.397
- Hey, I don't have
this leaf yet. Whoa.

06:04.464 --> 06:07.300
When did Fee get a tail?

06:07.366 --> 06:10.169
- Mine!
- Aah!

06:10.236 --> 06:13.372
- Let go of her! Let go!

06:13.840 --> 06:16.976
- [both groaning]

06:17.043 --> 06:19.212
- Ow.

06:20.246 --> 06:22.115
- Ugh.
- Why'd you try to eat Krafts?

06:22.181 --> 06:23.549
- Wait, who is that?

06:23.616 --> 06:26.085
- Dade.
- Oh, tattle-pants.

06:26.152 --> 06:27.353
- I don't-- I--

06:27.420 --> 06:28.588
- You kinda are.

06:28.654 --> 06:30.289
- Dude, I really need your help.

06:30.356 --> 06:32.291
Those jerk squirrels
took my brother.

06:32.358 --> 06:33.893
- What? They took Foo?

06:33.960 --> 06:35.795
Is he okay? Does he love me?

06:35.862 --> 06:37.130
- What did Foo do to them?

06:37.196 --> 06:38.331
Something jerky I bet.

06:38.397 --> 06:40.399
And what's wrong with your eyes?

06:40.466 --> 06:42.335
- I don't have time for
your questions, bunny.

06:42.401 --> 06:44.670
- We should help her. You guys.

06:44.737 --> 06:46.172
- She's bad news.

06:46.239 --> 06:49.475
And I got a policy
against bad news.

06:49.542 --> 06:53.279
- It's a nut with a note.

06:53.346 --> 06:55.515
- Whoa.
A nut note.

06:55.581 --> 06:57.817
- It says they captured Harvey.

06:57.884 --> 06:58.885
- They got Harvey?

06:58.951 --> 07:00.052
I gotta go tell my mom.

07:00.119 --> 07:01.487
- No! No tattling.

07:01.554 --> 07:03.723
- But they got Harvey.

07:03.790 --> 07:04.957
What do we do?

07:05.024 --> 07:06.993
- We do what Harvey would do.

07:07.059 --> 07:08.461
We negotiate.

07:08.528 --> 07:12.064
But we do it my way.

07:12.131 --> 07:15.301
- [singing tune]

07:16.502 --> 07:18.237
- What is taking so long?

07:18.304 --> 07:19.505
Where is the girl?

07:22.308 --> 07:23.910
- Hey! Hey! I said, hey!

07:23.976 --> 07:25.845
- Is this clock real?

07:25.912 --> 07:27.580
- Oops.
- What? Why would you do that?

07:27.647 --> 07:29.148
Go back to your corner.

07:29.215 --> 07:31.050
- Uh, excuse me.

07:31.117 --> 07:32.952
I need to use the restroom.

07:33.019 --> 07:36.455
- Oh, no. Can you not hold it?

07:36.522 --> 07:37.590
- I have a tiny bladder.

07:37.657 --> 07:40.126
My mom says it's genetic.

07:40.193 --> 07:42.295
- Sean-Jean, show him
to the toilet.

07:42.361 --> 07:43.830
And you, do not touch that.

07:43.896 --> 07:44.831
- [clatter]

07:44.897 --> 07:46.732
- Oops.

07:47.400 --> 07:49.135
- Oh, oh no.

07:49.202 --> 07:50.403
How...

07:50.469 --> 07:53.139
how am I even supposed to...

07:53.206 --> 07:55.608
Uh...all right.

07:55.675 --> 07:57.610
This isn't gonna be pretty.

07:57.677 --> 08:00.012
- Now you stay there
and don't move again.

08:00.079 --> 08:01.380
- [knocking at door]

08:01.447 --> 08:05.885
- FEE: All right, you buzz
brains, I'm here to talk.

08:05.952 --> 08:08.654
I came alone and unarmed.

08:08.721 --> 08:11.023
No tricks or games whatsoever.

08:11.090 --> 08:12.625
- [sneeze]
- Bless you.

08:15.328 --> 08:17.830
- Listen up barf cakes.

08:17.897 --> 08:18.965
I found this tail.

08:19.031 --> 08:20.233
And that makes it mine.

08:20.299 --> 08:22.201
But you guys are thieves.

08:22.268 --> 08:24.437
You stole my brother
and my friend.

08:24.503 --> 08:27.039
So I'm giving you
one chance to live.

08:27.106 --> 08:29.876
- Give us back the tail
and we are through.

08:29.942 --> 08:31.077
- Never.

08:34.447 --> 08:36.015
- Well, the joke's on you.

08:36.082 --> 08:37.283
I'm not alone.

08:37.350 --> 08:39.385
Surprise, idiots!

08:41.953 --> 08:45.825
- Oh! It's a trick! I totally
did not see that coming.

08:45.892 --> 08:47.827
- Everyone attack!

08:50.062 --> 08:51.163
- She's out of control.

08:51.230 --> 08:53.366
- Take that.
- Uh.

08:58.271 --> 09:00.106
- Aah!

09:02.241 --> 09:04.377
- Aah!
- Aah!

09:09.849 --> 09:13.052
- Oh, the pain.

09:13.119 --> 09:14.153
- It's skunk.

09:14.220 --> 09:16.389
- [coughing]

09:16.455 --> 09:18.057
- [toilet flushes]

09:19.425 --> 09:21.894
- Guys, I'm so sorry.

09:21.961 --> 09:26.299
Does anyone have a lot
of paper towels? Whoa!

09:26.365 --> 09:28.200
What's going on? Ow.

09:28.267 --> 09:30.670
- Harvey!

09:30.736 --> 09:32.672
Everything's gonna
be okay buddy.

09:32.738 --> 09:34.206
- Uh, Dade--
- I got Harvey.

09:34.273 --> 09:35.441
- And I have Foo.

09:35.508 --> 09:37.576
- Come on people.
Let's get out of here!

09:45.318 --> 09:46.719
- That was crazy.

09:46.786 --> 09:49.088
- Man,
we showed those fools good.

09:49.155 --> 09:52.024
Now they know if you mess
with the horned animal,

09:52.091 --> 09:53.659
you get the horns.

09:53.726 --> 09:56.462
- Uh, yes, but what we want
is the tail.

09:56.529 --> 09:58.698
- [gasps]

10:00.166 --> 10:03.069
- [muttering]

10:03.135 --> 10:04.103
- Ow!

10:04.170 --> 10:05.771
- That's right.

10:05.838 --> 10:08.007
As long as you have the tail
you will never be safe.

10:08.074 --> 10:10.343
We will always be there
right behind you,

10:10.409 --> 10:13.479
throwing nuts
and being annoying.

10:22.054 --> 10:24.457
- [sighs]

10:24.523 --> 10:25.992
Sorry little tail.

10:26.058 --> 10:28.027
We had some good times
you and me.

10:28.094 --> 10:30.763
And you really made
my butt feel complete.

10:30.830 --> 10:34.633
But we can't be together no more
because I have a couple of folks

10:34.700 --> 10:37.536
that are pretty much a billion
times more important to me.

10:37.603 --> 10:39.171
- It's really mature of you,
dude.

10:39.238 --> 10:40.539
- Shut up. I know.

10:40.606 --> 10:42.675
Come get your stupid tail
already.

10:42.742 --> 10:44.343
I don't want it anymore.

10:44.410 --> 10:47.113
- Ha. I'm glad
one of you is smart.

10:47.179 --> 10:50.116
Seriously, your friend
and brother are both

10:50.182 --> 10:52.385
such incredible dumb-dumbs.

10:52.451 --> 10:55.221
I am glad to be rid
of those pests.

10:55.287 --> 10:56.489
- You know what?

10:56.555 --> 10:58.758
I changed my mind.
- No!

10:59.959 --> 11:02.261
- Ugh!

11:02.328 --> 11:04.263
- [speaking French]

11:06.766 --> 11:09.368
- That's what you get talking
smack about my family.

11:09.435 --> 11:10.503
Come on, dudes.

11:10.569 --> 11:12.138
Let's go home.

11:12.204 --> 11:13.873
- I think you look better
without it anyway.

11:13.939 --> 11:15.508
- Yeah, I know you're lying.

11:15.574 --> 11:16.575
But thanks.

11:16.642 --> 11:17.676
- 20 leaves.

11:17.743 --> 11:19.478
We can do this.

11:19.545 --> 11:21.914
- I liked it better
with the squirrels.

11:23.716 --> 11:26.352
- Movie? Check.

11:26.419 --> 11:27.787
Hot chocolate?

11:27.853 --> 11:29.955
- Check.
- Marshmallows?

11:30.022 --> 11:31.957
Check.

11:32.024 --> 11:36.295
- Hey, you want some hot pepper
sauce for your hot chocolate?

11:36.362 --> 11:37.463
- Oh, Mom!

11:38.998 --> 11:40.733
- Harvey, come on, honey.

11:40.800 --> 11:43.536
Let's get this show
on the road already.

11:43.602 --> 11:46.005
- I burned the popcorn.

11:46.072 --> 11:47.606
- Hold on. Almost done.

11:47.673 --> 11:49.241
Okay.

11:49.308 --> 11:50.476
Hot chocolate?

11:50.543 --> 11:51.911
Check. Popcorn? Check.

11:51.977 --> 11:54.180
Burned? Check.
Oh, I almost forgot!

11:54.246 --> 11:58.951
I can't watch a movie without
Dad's old college hoodie.

11:59.018 --> 12:00.152
Hoodie, hoodie, hoodie.

12:00.219 --> 12:02.621
Embroidery, flannel,
golf shirt, hoodie?

12:02.688 --> 12:04.757
Huh?

12:04.824 --> 12:07.226
- [choking]

12:07.293 --> 12:09.095
- Irving,
you don't have to eat that.

12:09.161 --> 12:11.764
- Mom, Dad,
have you seen Dad's hoodie?

12:11.831 --> 12:13.999
- Sorry, honey,
I haven't touched that thing.

12:14.066 --> 12:14.900
- What?!

12:14.967 --> 12:16.602
Movie night is ruined!

12:16.669 --> 12:18.771
And there's only
one explanation.

12:30.616 --> 12:32.084
- [chatter]

12:32.151 --> 12:34.520
- Why did Harvey call us all
out here? Is it his birthday?

12:34.587 --> 12:36.055
- Uh, I don't know.

12:36.122 --> 12:37.857
Is it?

12:37.923 --> 12:39.625
- Happy birthday, Harvey.
- Happy birthday!

12:39.692 --> 12:41.293
- [groans]

12:42.628 --> 12:43.796
- Eh, I guess not.

12:43.863 --> 12:46.298
- Whew.

12:46.365 --> 12:47.566
- Thanks for coming out here
on such short notice.

12:47.633 --> 12:48.834
It means a lot to me.

12:48.901 --> 12:51.137
Someone stole my dad's hoodie.

12:51.203 --> 12:53.272
- I'm here for you, Harvey.

12:53.339 --> 12:55.975
- Dade, would you please
pass out these flyers?

12:56.041 --> 12:57.843
It's the most recent photo
I have.

12:57.910 --> 12:59.745
- Uh, uh--

12:59.812 --> 13:01.347
- Claire, are you okay?

13:01.413 --> 13:03.215
- Yeah, sorry I'm late.

13:03.282 --> 13:04.817
I lost my glasses.

13:04.884 --> 13:06.418
Usually when this happens,

13:06.485 --> 13:08.787
I follow the glare
from Princess's tiara.

13:08.854 --> 13:10.356
- You're not allowed to look
at it.

13:10.422 --> 13:12.658
- Princess,
you're not wearing your tiara.

13:12.725 --> 13:14.627
- But what-- where is it then?

13:14.693 --> 13:17.663
- I can't find my book
or happiness.

13:17.730 --> 13:20.900
- Hmm. this can't all
be a coincidence.

13:20.966 --> 13:22.334
Claire's glasses.

13:22.401 --> 13:23.536
Princesses Tiara.

13:23.602 --> 13:25.404
Kraft's thing.

13:25.471 --> 13:26.639
My dad's hoodie.

13:26.705 --> 13:28.340
There's only one explanation.

13:28.407 --> 13:30.176
There's a thief among us.

13:30.242 --> 13:31.610
- [gasps]

13:31.677 --> 13:33.045
- Oh, no. What do we do?

13:33.112 --> 13:35.714
- We'll handle them ourselves.

13:35.781 --> 13:37.116
Everyone take a spear.

13:37.183 --> 13:39.518
- Aah!

13:39.585 --> 13:42.154
- Harvey, it's obvious
who the culprits are.

13:42.221 --> 13:44.490
- It's the twins!
- Oh, come on.

13:44.557 --> 13:45.824
- Don't act like it wasn't you.

13:45.891 --> 13:49.595
- Boo.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold up.

13:49.662 --> 13:51.463
These guys are my best buds.

13:51.530 --> 13:53.165
They'd never do this.

13:53.232 --> 13:55.100
- Okay. First of all,
I'm your best bud, Harvey.

13:55.167 --> 13:57.269
And second of all,
of course they did it.

13:57.336 --> 13:59.672
The twins do
bad stuff all the time.

13:59.738 --> 14:01.373
- Pfft. Like what?

14:01.440 --> 14:05.411
- Like yesterday when you glued
my ears to a tree.

14:05.477 --> 14:07.046
Help.

14:07.112 --> 14:09.348
And when Foo ate
all of Claire's books last week.

14:09.415 --> 14:11.116
- Thanks for hanging out
with me, Foo.

14:11.183 --> 14:12.618
Here.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.353
Eat them all.
- Or how about today

14:14.420 --> 14:16.488
when you ruined Perry Perry's
sketchbook.

14:16.555 --> 14:17.890
- Oh, they didn't ruin it.

14:17.957 --> 14:21.093
They made it beautiful. See!

14:21.160 --> 14:24.563
- Okay, first of all,
all those pranks are hilarious.

14:24.630 --> 14:27.233
And second of all,
you can't just assume it's us

14:27.299 --> 14:29.001
because of stuff
we've done did before.

14:29.068 --> 14:30.636
That's called being judgey.

14:30.703 --> 14:31.937
Could've been anyone.

14:32.004 --> 14:33.372
Could've been Ruder.

14:33.439 --> 14:34.673
He's weird. Or Princess.

14:34.740 --> 14:35.908
She's weird.

14:35.975 --> 14:37.676
Or Perry Perry. She's weird.

14:37.743 --> 14:38.777
- Ahh.

14:38.844 --> 14:40.546
- Wait, I'm weird too.

14:40.613 --> 14:42.548
Could've been me.

14:44.016 --> 14:47.253
- [crosstalk]

14:47.319 --> 14:50.189
- Um, guys,
I don't think Crafts is guilty.

14:50.256 --> 14:51.890
We need to be rational.

14:51.957 --> 14:53.425
We'll search the neighborhood.

14:53.492 --> 14:54.693
Collect evidence.

14:54.760 --> 14:56.495
We'll get to the bottom of this.

14:56.562 --> 14:59.298
- Let's got get some cabbages
to throw at the thief.

14:59.365 --> 15:01.300
- [cheering]

15:01.367 --> 15:02.735
- [sighs]

15:02.801 --> 15:04.103
- I'll help you look, Harvey.

15:04.169 --> 15:08.707
- Really? Don't worry,
Crafts, justice will be served.

15:08.774 --> 15:14.480
- Guys, these ropes are pulling
in a really uncomfortable place.

15:23.722 --> 15:26.625
- All right, this area's secure.

15:34.400 --> 15:36.201
You find any clues
up there, Foo?

15:36.268 --> 15:37.369
- Nope.

15:37.436 --> 15:41.707
- Hmm. Well,
I guess that means we've been...

15:41.774 --> 15:43.509
barking up the wrong tree.

15:43.575 --> 15:44.743
- ["CSI" music plays]

15:44.810 --> 15:46.845
- Oh, hey,
we wearing glasses now?

15:46.912 --> 15:49.948
- Wait, Foo,
aren't those Claire's glasses?

15:50.015 --> 15:51.784
- Nope. They were Claire's.

15:51.850 --> 15:53.252
But now they're mine.

15:53.319 --> 15:54.920
- Okay.

15:54.987 --> 15:59.191
Foo, do you know
where my dad's hoodie is?

15:59.258 --> 16:01.660
- Here it is.
- Oh, Foo!

16:01.727 --> 16:03.729
- Whoa.

16:03.796 --> 16:05.364
- You're the thief?

16:05.431 --> 16:07.066
- Did I do
something bad, Harvey?

16:07.132 --> 16:10.035
- Yes, Foo,
you're stealing from people.

16:10.102 --> 16:11.870
- No, I'm not.

16:11.937 --> 16:13.739
I just like collecting stuff
from my friends.

16:13.806 --> 16:15.274
So when I look at them

16:15.341 --> 16:17.242
I remember all the friendship
memories.

16:17.309 --> 16:21.213
- Oh, it's kind of sweet,
dude, and a little weird.

16:21.280 --> 16:23.615
But why didn't you say
something before?

16:23.682 --> 16:28.153
- Everyone's way upset.
- Oh, is that why they're mad?

16:28.220 --> 16:30.489
Huh. I did not put
that together.

16:30.556 --> 16:33.992
- It's not funny!
We're in big trouble, Foo!

16:34.059 --> 16:37.162
- [chanting "cabbage the thief"]

16:39.865 --> 16:41.867
- Fee... Fee.

16:41.934 --> 16:44.536
Sorry, I need
to tell you something.

16:44.603 --> 16:47.005
This news I have,
it's pretty shocking.

16:47.072 --> 16:48.474
You may want to take a seat.

16:48.540 --> 16:51.810
Crafts wasn't the thief.
It was Foo!

16:51.877 --> 16:53.512
- Is that it?

16:53.579 --> 16:54.713
I already knew that.

16:54.780 --> 16:56.382
- What?

16:56.448 --> 16:57.983
- I am sick and tired of me
and my brother

16:58.050 --> 16:59.818
always getting blamed
for everything.

16:59.885 --> 17:01.587
- We have
to tell them the truth.

17:01.653 --> 17:03.956
- And throw my brother
to those jackals?

17:04.021 --> 17:07.559
- [clamoring]

17:07.626 --> 17:08.827
- They already think Crafts
did it.

17:08.894 --> 17:11.329
They're happy as long as
they have somebody to blame.

17:11.396 --> 17:13.098
- Wait a minute. That's it.

17:13.165 --> 17:14.700
That's how we fix this.

17:14.767 --> 17:16.969
- Yeah, let them have Crafts.
I just said it.

17:17.035 --> 17:18.203
- No, no, no.

17:18.270 --> 17:19.872
They want someone to blame?

17:19.938 --> 17:23.108
We'll give 'em exactly
what they want.

17:23.175 --> 17:25.911
- We look so dumb.

17:25.978 --> 17:28.280
- Really? I think
we look pretty cool.

17:28.347 --> 17:30.249
Okay, here's the plan.

17:30.315 --> 17:31.917
We lure everybody to the cliff.

17:31.984 --> 17:33.285
Then we'll...

17:33.352 --> 17:35.087
[whispering indistinctly]

17:35.921 --> 17:37.823
Foo, stop whispering.

17:37.890 --> 17:38.924
I'm whispering right now.

17:38.991 --> 17:40.159
- Sorry, Harvey.

17:43.996 --> 17:45.597
- You guys aren't really good
at this.

17:45.664 --> 17:48.434
- Muahaha.

17:48.500 --> 17:50.002
- Who is that?

17:50.068 --> 17:53.705
- It is I,
the Little Bark Bandit.

17:53.772 --> 17:55.207
- [gasps]

17:55.274 --> 17:56.675
- Oh, my gosh.

17:56.742 --> 17:59.845
- I'm the one who stole your
stuff, because I'm the bandit.

17:59.912 --> 18:01.613
And that's what I do.

18:01.680 --> 18:05.217
I bet all of you would love
to have your stuff back.

18:05.284 --> 18:07.453
Well, I've got it right here.

18:07.519 --> 18:09.054
See?

18:09.121 --> 18:12.224
And now I'm going to run away.

18:14.026 --> 18:17.930
Uh, oh, uh...

18:17.996 --> 18:19.898
muahaha.

18:19.965 --> 18:22.134
- Let's get him!

18:27.372 --> 18:29.475
- Hey, where'd he go?

18:29.541 --> 18:31.910
- I'm over here, you dinguses.

18:31.977 --> 18:33.812
Haha.

18:34.680 --> 18:36.148
- Guys, what are we waiting for?

18:36.215 --> 18:38.116
Let's catch that crook.

18:41.753 --> 18:44.122
- Foo,
what are you still doing here?

18:44.189 --> 18:45.824
- Eating bugs.

18:45.891 --> 18:47.159
- You're supposed to be running
toward the cliff.

18:47.226 --> 18:48.694
- Oh, yeah.

18:50.963 --> 18:51.964
- Ah-haha.

18:52.030 --> 18:53.599
- The cliff is the other way.

18:53.665 --> 18:55.267
- [laughing]

18:59.505 --> 19:02.474
- How is he doing this?

19:02.541 --> 19:05.477
- We're gonna get
that bandit good, right, Harvey?

19:05.544 --> 19:06.778
- Uh, yeah.

19:06.845 --> 19:09.147
Actually I have
to go use the bathroom.

19:09.214 --> 19:10.516
- Wait a second.

19:10.582 --> 19:12.651
Best friends should always go
to the bathroom together.

19:12.718 --> 19:16.488
Uh, ah...

19:16.555 --> 19:17.990
- [gasp]

19:18.056 --> 19:20.158
- Harvey?

19:20.225 --> 19:21.393
- Dade, wait.

19:21.460 --> 19:22.995
I know it looks bad.

19:23.061 --> 19:24.263
- Shh.

19:24.329 --> 19:25.697
Don't say a word.

19:25.764 --> 19:27.132
We all have our secrets.

19:27.199 --> 19:32.671
And, Harvey, I will take your
secret to my grave and beyond.

19:32.738 --> 19:34.206
- Cool. Thanks, dude.

19:34.273 --> 19:35.841
- Go! Get out of here.

19:35.908 --> 19:37.643
You beautiful monster.

19:37.709 --> 19:40.712
- [crosstalk]

19:40.779 --> 19:41.613
- What's he doing there?

19:41.680 --> 19:43.749
- Look, dummies,
it's the bandit!

19:43.815 --> 19:46.218
- After him.
- Get him.

19:46.285 --> 19:49.354
- Wait. Before you throw
me off this cliff,

19:49.421 --> 19:51.423
let me ask you one question.

19:51.490 --> 19:56.261
Who is really the criminal here?

19:56.328 --> 19:57.763
- I guess you.

19:57.829 --> 19:59.798
- No, look at yourselves.

19:59.865 --> 20:01.466
Look at what you've become--

20:01.533 --> 20:04.836
ready to tear each other apart
for what?

20:04.903 --> 20:06.605
Some stuff?

20:06.672 --> 20:10.309
Isn't having friends cooler
than having their stuff?

20:10.375 --> 20:13.845
So am I the Little Bark Bandit?
Yes.

20:13.912 --> 20:16.982
Did I take all of your stuff
without asking?

20:17.049 --> 20:18.750
Yes.

20:18.817 --> 20:21.587
And does this cape make
me look really, really cool?

20:21.653 --> 20:25.591
Yes. But you guys,
you're the thieves.

20:25.657 --> 20:28.927
And you've stolen friendship.

20:28.994 --> 20:32.030
