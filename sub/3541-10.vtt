Previously on The Vampire Diaries:

00:03.920 --> 00:07.798
Vampires and werewolves used to roam
freely, until a shaman put a curse on them.

00:07.966 --> 00:11.427
Werewolves can only turn on a full moon.
Vampires are weakened by the sun.

00:11.594 --> 00:14.430
The werewolf part of the curse,
it's sealed with a moonstone.

00:14.597 --> 00:17.307
- He told me about your ex, Katherine.
- You must be Elena.

00:17.517 --> 00:18.934
How do we look exactly alike?

00:19.102 --> 00:22.271
- The moonstone is what breaks the curse.
- Sacrifice breaks it.

00:22.439 --> 00:25.107
The blood of the doppelgänger.
You're the doppelgänger.

00:25.275 --> 00:27.026
Don't. You need me. Elena's in danger.

00:27.193 --> 00:28.819
- Klaus is the real deal.
- Who is he?

00:28.987 --> 00:30.279
From the first generation.

00:30.447 --> 00:33.282
The oldest vampire in the history of time
is coming after me?

00:33.450 --> 00:35.826
- Luka.
- I'd like to introduce you to my dad.

00:36.036 --> 00:37.077
Jonas Martin.

00:37.287 --> 00:40.456
- You're a witch?
- We prefer the term "warlock."

ELENA: Elijah.
DAMON: One of The Originals. A legend.

00:43.668 --> 00:45.836
You got in touch with Elijah.
How'd you do it?

00:46.046 --> 00:47.087
A guy named Slater.

00:47.297 --> 00:51.008

but you need the moonstone.

There's plenty of room for all of us.

- I'd rather poke my eyes out.

Get your witch to hocus-pocus me out of
here, you can have whatever you want.

04:29.269 --> 04:31.103
I thought you liked it in here.

04:31.312 --> 04:33.897
Nice and safe,
where Klaus can't get to you.

04:34.065 --> 04:36.900
- I've had time to reconsider.
- Meaning you're hungry.

04:37.527 --> 04:40.237
I'm starving, Damon. And dirty.

04:40.405 --> 04:41.905
But above all, I'm bored.

04:42.573 --> 04:45.367
At least
running from Klaus wasn't boring.

04:45.576 --> 04:46.618
So here's the deal.

04:46.828 --> 04:48.370
You get me out of here...

04:48.538 --> 04:52.582
...you get the moonstone,
and I'll disappear from Mystic Falls forever.

04:54.127 --> 04:58.380
- Let me know what you decide.
ELENA: You don't believe her, do you?

04:58.589 --> 05:00.757
No, of course not.
We just want the moonstone.

05:00.925 --> 05:04.636
There's a way to destroy the spell
that Klaus wants to break.

05:04.846 --> 05:08.181
No spell, no doppelgänger sacrifice.
Ergo, you live.

05:08.683 --> 05:10.892
How do you destroy it?

05:11.102 --> 05:13.478
By releasing it from the moonstone.

05:15.481 --> 05:17.232
How do you know this is gonna work?

05:17.692 --> 05:20.068
Because we have a crafty witch
on our side.

05:20.236 --> 05:21.653
You discussed it with Bonnie.

05:21.821 --> 05:24.656
She agreed to do anything she could
to help us.

05:24.866 --> 05:27.826
- Katherine has the moonstone.
- We're gonna get it from her.

05:27.994 --> 05:29.911
Well, what he means to say...

05:30.121 --> 05:33.832
...is that we will pry it from her cold,
dead hand if we have to.

05:34.083 --> 05:36.918
Bonnie needs to find a way
to release the seal long enough...

05:37.128 --> 05:39.588
...for us to get in, get the moonstone,
and get out.

05:39.797 --> 05:42.174
Wow. It sounds like
you guys have it all planned out.

Yep. We're awesome.

I don't want you to do it.

Elena, we don't have a choice.

05:54.270 --> 05:57.022
- What about Klaus?
- We'll find him after we get the stone.

05:57.190 --> 05:59.566
Is that before or after
he kills everyone...

05:59.734 --> 06:01.777
...I care about,
including the two of you?

06:01.986 --> 06:05.280
Elena, if we can de-spell the moonstone,
we can save your life.

06:05.490 --> 06:07.908
I know. Everybody keeps saying that.

06:12.372 --> 06:16.833
So your Grams waited till you were
in high school to tell you you're a witch?

06:17.001 --> 06:19.836
She'd brought it up before,
but I just thought she was drunk.

I can turn the metal to ash.

15:54.787 --> 15:56.204
Blow the ashes on her...

15:56.372 --> 16:00.208
...and it'll incapacitate her
for a minute or two.

16:00.376 --> 16:02.877
Long enough for you to get the stone
and get out.

And these bolts and chains.

I need new chains,
but the bolts could still hold.

There's no such thing as overreacting.

Those tears are for her.
She didn't care about Slater.

20:11.376 --> 20:14.462

long enough to see if he'd turn her.

of all of his vampire contacts...

...and I was hoping
that he could point me towards Klaus.

20:44.576 --> 20:48.079
Doubtful.
Klaus doesn't wanna be pointed out.

33:04.524 --> 33:06.733
Like you kind of need it.

33:16.244 --> 33:19.871
I was alone when I turned.

33:21.207 --> 33:26.044
I had no control over my body
or my urges.

33:26.879 --> 33:28.088
And...

33:31.426 --> 33:33.593
...I killed somebody.

33:36.848 --> 33:40.767
I don't want that to happen to you.

33:42.729 --> 33:45.272
I don't want you to be alone.

33:50.945 --> 33:52.404
[DOORBELL RINGS]

33:54.490 --> 33:56.616
I gotta...

34:07.462 --> 34:10.797
- Matt.
- I know I should've called. I'm sorry.

34:11.007 --> 34:12.299
What are you doing here?

34:12.550 --> 34:16.428
I don't know, but I was driving home
from work, and I just...

34:16.596 --> 34:18.804
I kind of found myself here.

34:19.306 --> 34:20.306
Well, are you okay?

34:20.516 --> 34:23.226
I've been worried about you.

34:23.811 --> 34:25.645
I miss you.

34:33.821 --> 34:35.447
Yeah.

34:37.658 --> 34:39.326
Matty...

34:42.830 --> 34:46.123
Hey.

34:49.253 --> 34:50.795
DAMON:
Time to go.

34:50.963 --> 34:54.674
Alice is soundly sleeping and won't
remember a moment of this stupid day.

34:58.179 --> 35:01.014
- We're here to meet the doppelgänger.
- Thank you for coming.

35:01.182 --> 35:03.558
I will break your arm.

35:05.853 --> 35:07.312
There's nothing here for you.

35:19.200 --> 35:20.784
I killed you. You were dead.

35:20.993 --> 35:22.202
For centuries now.

35:23.287 --> 35:24.788
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

35:24.997 --> 35:26.873
I'm Elijah.

35:27.792 --> 35:31.128
We were gonna bring her to you,
for Klaus.

35:31.337 --> 35:33.547
She's the doppelgänger.

35:33.714 --> 35:35.715
I don't know how she exists,
but she does.

35:35.883 --> 35:37.801
Klaus would wanna see her.

35:38.010 --> 35:40.595
- Does anyone else know you're here?
- No.

35:41.639 --> 35:44.307
Well, then you have been
incredibly helpful.

36:10.543 --> 36:12.460
Where's Luka?

36:13.421 --> 36:14.796
Asleep.

36:15.631 --> 36:17.632
Your shadow spell was successful.

36:18.301 --> 36:21.428
I was able to track that girl.

36:22.471 --> 36:26.933
However, I did have a little run-in
with one of the brothers that killed me.

36:27.935 --> 36:30.187
I assume he didn't live to tell about it.

36:30.438 --> 36:31.980
Actually, I spared him.

36:33.608 --> 36:37.110
He'd die before he let anything happen
to her. They both would.

36:39.530 --> 36:41.448
She'll be kept safe.

36:42.200 --> 36:43.533
For now.

36:43.743 --> 36:47.162
Well, that's precisely
what we need her to be.

36:50.124 --> 36:51.249
Safe.

37:01.469 --> 37:02.719
I'm home, okay?

37:06.057 --> 37:08.600
- I don't need an escort to my room.
- I don't know.

37:08.768 --> 37:12.520
Between here and upstairs, there's still
time for you to do something stupid.

37:12.688 --> 37:13.855
I already feel bad.

37:14.023 --> 37:16.775
- I don't need you to berate me.
- Stefan is stuck in there.

37:16.943 --> 37:20.028
And I don't know how to get him out.
What should I be doing?

37:20.196 --> 37:22.656
You should admit
that you never should've tried this.

37:22.823 --> 37:26.201
- I didn't have a choice, Jeremy.
- Yeah, well, neither did I.

37:28.496 --> 37:32.749
- Why did you have to get involved?
- Because I didn't want you to get hurt.

37:36.170 --> 37:37.379
Jeremy.

37:39.257 --> 37:42.509
You can't feel that way about me.

37:43.636 --> 37:45.011
Don't.

37:46.555 --> 37:48.014
What?

37:48.891 --> 37:51.184
Don't act like this is one-sided. Like...

37:51.727 --> 37:55.522
Like I'm some kid
that has a crush on his sister's friend.

37:57.566 --> 37:59.901
You could have died today.

38:02.947 --> 38:04.781
And you almost did.

38:06.325 --> 38:09.160
That was a chance
I was willing to take.

38:10.663 --> 38:15.292
I can't.

38:16.836 --> 38:18.420
I'm sorry.

38:19.338 --> 38:20.964
Yeah.

38:34.895 --> 38:36.396
ELENA:
Thank you for bringing me home.

38:36.564 --> 38:39.691
DAMON: Well, your ride left you.
I didn't wanna leave you stranded.

38:40.568 --> 38:41.568
She was just scared.

38:41.736 --> 38:43.236
She didn't mean to run.

38:43.446 --> 38:45.864
Yes, she did.
She's been running for 500 years.

38:46.073 --> 38:47.532
I can't believe Elijah's alive.

38:47.700 --> 38:50.869
Why do you think he killed
those two vampires and just let us go?

38:51.037 --> 38:55.415
If I had a dollar for every time
some evil vampire surprised me...

38:59.378 --> 39:01.838
What you did today
was incredibly stupid.

39:02.006 --> 39:05.759
Actually, the only thing that was stupid
was that I got caught.

39:06.469 --> 39:08.470
I don't question
why you and Stefan...

39:08.637 --> 39:10.805
...and everyone else tries so hard
to save me.

39:10.973 --> 39:14.684
You shouldn't question
why I would try to save all of you.

39:15.519 --> 39:17.937
Damon, good night, okay?

39:18.272 --> 39:20.482
- What?
- Stefan.

39:22.360 --> 39:24.152
Stefan.

39:25.404 --> 39:26.446
Stefan!

39:28.324 --> 39:30.575
- Don't you dare.
- Stefan's in there, Damon.

39:30.743 --> 39:32.327
How could you let this happen?

39:32.536 --> 39:34.871
I was busy saving you
from your kamikaze mission.

39:35.039 --> 39:37.791
ELENA: You didn't even have to go
after the moonstone.

39:37.958 --> 39:39.376
DAMON:
It was the right call, Elena.

39:39.627 --> 39:42.170
ELENA: Right call?
How is any of this the right call?

39:42.963 --> 39:46.132
Damon, let go of me.

39:46.550 --> 39:51.012
Let go of me.

39:51.514 --> 39:53.306
Please.

39:55.393 --> 39:56.976
You done?

40:02.858 --> 40:03.983
Tsk-tsk.

40:14.954 --> 40:17.997
Of all the idiot plans, Stefan...

40:19.792 --> 40:23.503
- I'll find a way to get you out.
- That's all right. I'll, uh...

40:23.671 --> 40:25.296
I'll handle myself.

40:25.506 --> 40:29.467
Bonnie has the moonstone.
Try to figure out how to de-spell it.

40:29.677 --> 40:31.302
DAMON:
You martyr yourself into a tomb.

40:31.470 --> 40:35.223
I get partnered with
a semi-competent witch. Wonderful.

40:36.851 --> 40:39.436
- Keep Elena away from here.
- Yeah, that'll be easy.

40:39.937 --> 40:40.979
Promise me...

40:41.147 --> 40:45.900
...no matter what happens,
you'll protect her.

40:48.571 --> 40:50.238
Promise.

40:57.788 --> 41:01.791
That right there was the biggest mistake
you've ever made.
