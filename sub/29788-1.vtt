00:15.208 --> 00:17.333
Did you just try to punch
the wall and miss?

No. I clipped it. I got it.

Hello, Sydney.
How are you?

01:17.625 --> 01:19.208
(audience cheering)

01:19.291 --> 01:21.625
Good. It's fucking
lovely to be back,

01:21.709 --> 01:22.750
uh, genuinely,

01:22.834 --> 01:24.125
that's why we're filming
this here again:

01:24.208 --> 01:25.834
'cause it was so good
fucking last time.

01:25.917 --> 01:28.083
-So, don't screw this up.
-(laughter)

01:28.166 --> 01:29.667
Uh, get comfortable.

01:29.750 --> 01:31.917
And if you're not comfortable,
don't worry about it too much.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.667
I'm about to provide
plenty of material

01:33.750 --> 01:37.709
that's going to make most of you
very fucking uncomfortable.

01:37.792 --> 01:41.000
-(laughter)
-Let's crack on.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.500
I love kids.

01:43.583 --> 01:45.875
(laughter)

01:45.959 --> 01:47.959
-I do.
-(laughter)

01:48.041 --> 01:50.500
Love kids, love babies,
I love toddlers.

01:50.583 --> 01:53.291
I love tiny little children.
Love 'em.

01:54.959 --> 01:57.166
There should not be this much
tension in the room.

01:57.250 --> 01:59.125
(laughter)

01:59.208 --> 02:01.417
I haven't said
anything bad there.

02:01.500 --> 02:03.792
I said something nice,
something sweet,
something endearing,

02:03.875 --> 02:05.792
but most important--
something legal!

02:05.875 --> 02:08.417
-(laughter)
-I love kids.

02:08.500 --> 02:10.458
Some of you
still don't trust me.

02:10.542 --> 02:12.542
That's fine, I get that,
that could be my fault.

02:12.625 --> 02:16.542
I'm a comedian that's got
a reputation for having
a "dark" sense of humor.

02:16.625 --> 02:18.208
Maybe you expect me
to take that premise,

02:18.291 --> 02:19.667
turn it into an
offensive punchline,

02:19.750 --> 02:21.125
all for the sake
of shock comedy.

02:21.208 --> 02:23.542
I promise you that's not
gonna happen with this joke.

02:23.625 --> 02:24.959
(laughter)

02:25.041 --> 02:27.041
Maybe it's another factor
that I hadn't considered.

02:27.125 --> 02:28.709
Maybe it's the fact
that I'm a white man

02:28.792 --> 02:31.625
and we don't have the best
history with... children.

02:31.709 --> 02:33.083
(laughter)

02:33.166 --> 02:35.417
I can't say for certain.
All I know for certain

02:35.500 --> 02:37.875
is that whenever I proudly
declare that I love kids

02:37.959 --> 02:41.542
-at least half of you
fuckers go "He-he-he."
-(laughter)

02:41.625 --> 02:43.792
Every gig without fail,
no matter where I am.

02:43.875 --> 02:45.750
I love kids!
"He's gonna fuck one."

02:45.834 --> 02:47.959
-I'm not.
-(laughter)

02:48.041 --> 02:50.542
I'm not gonna fuck one.
Why would I fuck one?

02:50.625 --> 02:53.709
-They are not my type.
-(laughter)

02:53.792 --> 02:56.041
I have three younger siblings,
I've got nine younger cousins.

02:56.125 --> 02:59.166
From the age of two,
I've been raised around kids.
I love kids, I really do.

02:59.250 --> 03:03.000
And I hate the fact
that I have to qualify
my love of children.

03:03.083 --> 03:05.667
'Cause I don't have to qualify
my love of anything else.

03:05.750 --> 03:07.542
I love dogs.

03:07.625 --> 03:11.625
(laughter)

03:11.709 --> 03:13.792
None of you are like,
"He's gonna fuck a poodle!"

03:13.875 --> 03:16.875
-It's not...
-(laughter)

03:16.959 --> 03:19.709
-And I would fuck a poodle.
-(laughter)

03:19.792 --> 03:21.709
I absolutely would.
It's small, it's on a leash.

03:21.792 --> 03:25.208
-Where's it gonna go?
-(laughter)

03:26.250 --> 03:29.000
-I love my mom.
-(laughter)

03:29.083 --> 03:31.375
-Yeah.
-(laughter)

03:31.458 --> 03:33.875
None of you think
I'm gonna fuck her, do you?

03:33.959 --> 03:36.709
And I've been inside of her
and I've sucked her tits.

03:36.792 --> 03:39.667
(laughter)

03:39.750 --> 03:43.250
-Not at the same time.
-(laughter)

03:43.333 --> 03:46.041
That's when Dad gets jealous.

03:46.125 --> 03:48.458
(laughter)

03:54.208 --> 03:56.208
It's not good being a man
and being paternal.

03:56.291 --> 04:00.208
I guess if you're like--
maybe like a father,
you got kids that's cool.

04:00.291 --> 04:01.792
But if you've got no kids
and you love kids,

04:01.875 --> 04:03.375
some people find it weird.

04:03.458 --> 04:05.417
I noticed it 'cause my friends
are having kids now,

04:05.500 --> 04:06.959
so I get to go and play
with their kids, you know,

04:07.041 --> 04:09.125
running round a park,
chasing them around the place.

04:09.208 --> 04:12.375
-Again, not in a creepy way.
-(laughter)

04:12.458 --> 04:14.583
-Well...
-(laughter)

04:14.667 --> 04:16.041
I mean, don't get me wrong,
on a technicality,

04:16.125 --> 04:18.083
I am technically
chasing them round a park

04:18.166 --> 04:21.250
-while they scream
and beg me to stop.
-(laughter)

04:21.333 --> 04:24.709
But I promise you that
that is part of the game.

04:24.792 --> 04:28.458
When chasing children,
hand position is very,
very important, right?

04:28.542 --> 04:31.125
Funny monster, actual monster.

04:31.208 --> 04:33.834
-There is...
-(laughter)

04:34.917 --> 04:37.750
There is a subtle difference
between "I'm gonna get you"

04:37.834 --> 04:40.834
-(screams):
and "I'm gonna get you!"
-(laughter)

04:41.583 --> 04:45.417
Kids are intuitive
and they can tell
the difference.

04:45.500 --> 04:47.000
(laughter)

04:47.709 --> 04:49.208
I get jealous
of women sometimes.

04:49.291 --> 04:51.375
Women, you're allowed
to be openly maternal

04:51.458 --> 04:53.542
in ways that
I'm just not able to be.

04:53.625 --> 04:57.417
Women could be like,
"I was on a train the other day,
and I saw a baby,

04:57.500 --> 05:02.125
"So, I smiled at the baby,
and the baby smiled back.

05:02.208 --> 05:06.834
"And then I waved at the baby,
and the baby waved back.

05:06.917 --> 05:11.709
And, oh, my ovaries exploded."

05:11.792 --> 05:13.166
(laughter)

05:13.250 --> 05:17.625
"Oh, my poor explody ovaries
have done a 9/11 in my belly."

05:17.709 --> 05:19.291
(laughter)

05:19.375 --> 05:22.083
I get those exact
same emotions,

05:22.166 --> 05:24.500
but I'm not allowed to express
them in that way.

05:24.583 --> 05:27.291
-Or I go to jail!
-(laughter)

05:27.375 --> 05:28.750
Do you want proof of that claim?

05:28.834 --> 05:30.875
Fine, I have a goddaughter,
her name is Ava.

05:30.959 --> 05:32.417
She is two-and-a-half years old.

05:32.500 --> 05:35.792
She is without a doubt
the dumbest fucking moron...

05:35.875 --> 05:37.625
-(laughter)
-...I have ever had the--

05:37.709 --> 05:40.625
Oh, man, she's thick
as shit, man.
She's so great.

05:40.709 --> 05:42.125
And I know there'll be
parents in the room,

05:42.208 --> 05:44.125
they'll be like, "Oh, Daniel,
all kids are stupid."

05:44.208 --> 05:47.000
Oh, I know they are.
This one takes the biscuit.

05:47.083 --> 05:49.917
-(laughter)
-And shoves it
in her fucking ear.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.375
-She is...
-(laughter)

05:52.458 --> 05:56.000
She's about this big,
everything in her life
is a corner

05:56.083 --> 05:58.417
that exists directly
at eye height,

05:58.500 --> 06:01.000
and she sprints in every
direction, full speed,

06:01.083 --> 06:02.500
without checking her periphery

06:02.583 --> 06:04.834
because she doesn't know
that she can die yet.

06:04.917 --> 06:06.834
-(laughter)
-I love her unconditionally,

06:06.917 --> 06:09.166
but I don't think
she's gonna make it to ten.

06:09.250 --> 06:12.458
-(laughter)
-It would be nice,
but it might not happen.

06:12.542 --> 06:14.458
She does have an older sister.
I should point that out.

06:14.542 --> 06:16.166
But her older sister
is not my goddaughter,

06:16.250 --> 06:18.375
so I haven't learned
her fucking name.

06:18.458 --> 06:20.417
(laughter)

06:20.500 --> 06:22.667
Her parents made a shitty
decision on her behalf,

06:22.750 --> 06:25.291
-and she will suffer
the consequences.
-(laughter)

06:25.375 --> 06:28.709
I'll play with Ava,
and Slagathor can play
with her godfather...

06:28.792 --> 06:31.917
-(laughter)
-...whoever he may be.

06:34.917 --> 06:37.458
Ava's the best, man.
She's so fun.

06:37.959 --> 06:39.125
Always excited to see me,

06:39.208 --> 06:40.625
'cause, you know,
we play games together.

06:40.709 --> 06:42.250
Her favorite game
in the world
is hide-and-seek.

06:42.333 --> 06:43.875
Uh, she thinks
I invented hide-and-seek,

06:43.959 --> 06:45.542
and the reason she thinks
I invented hide-and-seek

06:45.625 --> 06:47.792
is because I told her that
I invented hide-and-seek.

06:47.875 --> 06:49.041
(laughter)

06:49.125 --> 06:50.875
And she's the worst
hide-and-seek player.

06:50.959 --> 06:52.792
And I know there's
gonna be parents in the room

06:52.875 --> 06:54.333
who are listening to me,
be like "Oh, Daniel,

06:54.417 --> 06:56.375
"Of course she's bad
at hide-and-seek, all kids are.

06:56.458 --> 06:59.083
Let me guess, she hides
behind the curtain and giggles."

06:59.166 --> 07:03.917
Ha-ha.
That is a Harvard graduate
compared to my fucking moron.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.458
(laughter)

07:05.542 --> 07:07.083
Let's just pretend
that this is just, like,

07:07.166 --> 07:09.041
a chair in the middle
of the living room, right?

07:09.125 --> 07:10.834
I'll be Ava and you be me,

07:10.917 --> 07:12.875
and let's see how long
it takes you to find me.

07:12.959 --> 07:16.041
-If indeed you can.
-(laughter)

07:16.125 --> 07:19.250
Allow me to just get
into character: fucking moron.

07:19.333 --> 07:22.125
(laughter)

07:28.875 --> 07:32.166
(laughter)

07:37.291 --> 07:40.125
-Did you find me?
-(laughter)

07:40.208 --> 07:42.709
Please note that
she doesn't hide like this.

07:42.792 --> 07:44.250
(laughter)

07:44.333 --> 07:48.041
She hides like this
because she likes
to maintain eye contact!

07:48.125 --> 07:50.834
-(laughter)
-For the duration of the game.

07:50.917 --> 07:52.417
Now, I love this moron.

07:52.500 --> 07:54.417
I don't want her growing up
knowing she's a moron.

07:54.500 --> 07:56.917
I want her growing up
feeling confident,
so I have to call her a genius.

07:57.000 --> 08:00.959
So, I have to spend five minutes
not fucking finding her,

08:01.041 --> 08:02.625
which is way more difficult.

08:02.709 --> 08:04.166
Then, the second
I can't find her,

08:04.250 --> 08:06.208
she starts laughing,
now I can hear the bitch.

08:06.291 --> 08:08.458
-(laughter)
-That is two senses

08:08.542 --> 08:11.083
I can now use to work out
where in the room she might be.

08:11.166 --> 08:13.041
Then she gets so excited
that she shits herself.

08:13.125 --> 08:16.875
-Three out of five.
-(laughter)

08:17.583 --> 08:19.500
One of the reasons
I love her so much

08:19.583 --> 08:22.625
is because she's got that,
you know, that kindness
that only some toddlers have,

08:22.709 --> 08:24.166
just that pure kindness.

08:24.250 --> 08:26.500
'Cause eventually
whenever I do find her,

08:26.583 --> 08:29.709
-she's proud of me.
-(laughter)

08:29.792 --> 08:32.792
Like, I'll eventually
turn around and be like,
"Oh there you are!"

08:32.875 --> 08:35.833
And she's like, "How did you--?"
You were fucking there!

08:35.917 --> 08:37.166
(laughter)

08:37.250 --> 08:39.667
She's so precious,
I'm gonna die.

08:40.166 --> 08:42.291
Her older sister, by the way,
is very good at hide-and-seek,

08:42.375 --> 08:44.917
but that's mainly 'cause
I never fucking look for her.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.792
(laughter)

08:46.875 --> 08:48.542
I'll still count and tell her
she's playing,

08:48.625 --> 08:50.917
and then once she's gone,
she's God's problem.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.083
(laughter)

08:56.917 --> 08:58.542
Ava sucks at seeking as well.

08:58.625 --> 09:01.041
She sucks at both halves
of the game, right?

09:01.125 --> 09:02.834
The last time when I was
round visiting her,

09:02.917 --> 09:05.542
we were playing hide-and-seek,
she looked in a drawer.

09:05.625 --> 09:08.417
(laughter)

09:09.166 --> 09:11.709
It was the one and only
place she looked.

09:11.792 --> 09:14.000
She walked into the kitchen
confident as fuck.

09:14.083 --> 09:17.875
She was like, "If I know
my godfather, and I think I do,

09:17.959 --> 09:19.917
he'll be in the knife drawer."

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
(laughter)

09:22.083 --> 09:24.125
"That's where I would be."

09:24.208 --> 09:25.834
She opened up the knife drawer,
I wasn't in there,

09:25.917 --> 09:28.875
she forgot she was playing,
and then she fucked off.

09:28.959 --> 09:30.333
(laughter)

09:30.417 --> 09:32.542
Just me and her sister
hiding under a table.

09:32.625 --> 09:34.709
Like, "What the fuck
is this shit?"

09:34.792 --> 09:36.583
Her sister was like,
"Annoying, isn't it?"

09:36.667 --> 09:40.959
-Shut your whore mouth!
I fucking swear to God.
-(laughter)

09:43.625 --> 09:45.583
Love being a god-dad,
love being a god-dad.

09:45.667 --> 09:47.667
Uh, it's good fun.
I don't see--

09:47.750 --> 09:50.083
I feel guilty sometimes
'cause, I travel a lot
with this job.

09:50.166 --> 09:51.834
I don't see Ava
as much as I'd like to.

09:51.917 --> 09:54.667
So, whenever I do, I spoil her
just so she still loves me.

09:54.750 --> 09:57.375
Not with like treats and stuff,
like, you know, physical things.

09:57.458 --> 09:58.792
I like to take her
on experiences

09:58.875 --> 10:00.750
so she's got positive
memories of me there.

10:00.834 --> 10:04.083
So, I always take her to farms
'cause she loves horses,
they blow her mind,

10:04.166 --> 10:06.542
and she loves feeding them,
and the last time
we were feeding horses--

10:06.625 --> 10:08.500
Her dad trusts me
'cause I'm a good god-dad,

10:08.583 --> 10:10.542
and he's like, "Can you look
after her for five minutes,

10:10.625 --> 10:12.750
-and don't fuck this up?"
-And I was like... (scoffs).

10:12.834 --> 10:15.250
-And then...
-(laughter)

10:15.333 --> 10:18.250
...while he was at the toilet,
I took my special time with her

10:18.333 --> 10:20.542
to just teach her
just how to, uh...

10:22.166 --> 10:24.458
(laughter)

10:24.542 --> 10:28.291
Not to people.
Never, never to people.

10:28.375 --> 10:30.750
-Just to horses.
-(laughter)

10:30.834 --> 10:34.041
I looked my two-year-old
goddaughter in her
perfect blue eyes,

10:34.125 --> 10:37.667
and I said, "Ava, this means
I love you horsey."

10:37.750 --> 10:40.041
(laughter)

10:40.125 --> 10:43.041
Why? Because
who's the victim?

10:43.792 --> 10:45.750
There isn't one.
I've triple-checked.

10:45.834 --> 10:47.333
She doesn't know
what she's doing.

10:47.417 --> 10:50.667
All she knows is that
I am crying with laughter.

10:50.750 --> 10:53.083
The horse doesn't know
it's offended.

10:53.166 --> 10:55.291
-It's a fucking horse.
-(laughter)

10:55.375 --> 10:59.959
And now she thinks that
is what you do to horses.

11:00.041 --> 11:02.291
And it is never not funny.

11:02.375 --> 11:05.792
Nobody in this room has
the ability to watch

11:05.875 --> 11:08.917
a two-year-old flip off
every horse she sees,

11:09.000 --> 11:13.083
and go "No, I don't understand
why that's amusing."

11:13.166 --> 11:15.083
-(laughter)
-It gets funnier every time,

11:15.166 --> 11:16.834
'cause you see the horses
before she does

11:16.917 --> 11:18.875
and you know it's coming.

11:18.959 --> 11:22.500
Her dad still sends me
videos of her being driven
past fields of horses,

11:22.583 --> 11:25.125
and she's just like "Horses!"

11:25.208 --> 11:27.875
-So good!
-(laughter)

11:27.959 --> 11:29.709
Why would you not want
that in your life

11:29.792 --> 11:32.333
at every available opportunity?

11:32.417 --> 11:34.667
Free serotonin!

11:34.750 --> 11:37.583
(laughter)

11:39.583 --> 11:42.500
I love spoiling her.
I shouldn't do it,
but I love doing it.

11:42.583 --> 11:45.792
Be a Tuesday night at
like 9 p.m., I'll be visiting,

11:45.875 --> 11:48.667
I'll be like,
Ava, do you want some ice cream?

11:48.750 --> 11:51.208
She'll be like, "Mum says
I'm not allowed any ice cream."

11:51.291 --> 11:54.208
I went to high school with
your mother and I've seen
her get fingered.

11:54.291 --> 11:58.834
-You can get some
fucking ice cream.
-(laughter)

12:03.291 --> 12:05.375
You let me deal with mommy bear.

12:05.458 --> 12:08.166
-Okay?
-(laughter)

12:14.125 --> 12:15.625
I also hate saying
goodbye to her,

12:15.709 --> 12:17.875
'cause it makes her sad
and I don't like seeing her sad.

12:17.959 --> 12:21.959
-So, I just leave.
-(laughter)

12:22.041 --> 12:23.917
Last time I left,
I grabbed my suitcase--

12:24.000 --> 12:26.625
I was visiting her
before I came on this trip--
and, uh, grabbed my suitcase.

12:26.709 --> 12:29.000
Now she must've remembered
the last time that I left
with a suitcase

12:29.083 --> 12:31.000
that she didn't see me
for a couple of months.

12:31.083 --> 12:32.417
'Cause the second
I grabbed the handle,

12:32.500 --> 12:33.834
she stopped what she was doing,

12:33.917 --> 12:35.458
she ran as fast as she could
across the living room,

12:35.542 --> 12:37.458
just daring any table
to end her life.

12:37.542 --> 12:40.417
-(laughter)
-By some miracle she got to me,

12:40.500 --> 12:41.750
she wraps her arms
around my legs,

12:41.834 --> 12:43.583
she squeezed as tightly
as she possibly could,

12:43.667 --> 12:45.500
and she looked up
and she said "Bye, Dan-Dan."

12:45.583 --> 12:49.291
She calls me Dan-Dan.
"Bye, Dan-Dan. Love you."

12:50.583 --> 12:52.500
And my balls exploded.

12:52.583 --> 12:57.333
(laughter and applause)

12:59.083 --> 13:02.125
-Why is that different?
-(laughter)

13:02.208 --> 13:05.083
It's the exact same sentiment!

13:05.166 --> 13:07.500
That's also where
they come from!

13:07.583 --> 13:09.333
(laughter)

13:10.583 --> 13:12.291
Everyday sexism.

13:12.375 --> 13:15.250
(laughter)

13:18.875 --> 13:21.709
I want to be a dad, not yet.
I know I'm not ready
to be a dad.

13:21.792 --> 13:25.500
If you want proof of that,
listen to the last
fucking joke I told.

13:26.542 --> 13:29.291
I want to have daughters.
I just think I'd be better
with daughters,

13:29.375 --> 13:30.959
because I've got
two younger brothers

13:31.041 --> 13:33.667
and I spent most of my life just
beating the shit out of them

13:33.750 --> 13:35.667
'cause that's what you do
as a big brother.

13:35.750 --> 13:37.250
I'm nice to them now
but, you know,

13:37.333 --> 13:39.291
I've just never learned
how to be nice to boys.

13:39.375 --> 13:42.291
'Cause after my sister died,
I had two younger cousins--
female cousins turn up,

13:42.375 --> 13:44.834
and I really sort of
attached myself to them.
I was really nice to them.

13:44.917 --> 13:47.291
So I'm just-- I'm just worried
that that will sort of actually

13:47.375 --> 13:49.208
manifest themselves
into my fatherhood.

13:49.291 --> 13:51.333
Like, I'll have a daughter
and I'll be like,
"You're the best, I love you."

13:51.417 --> 13:53.500
My son'll turn up,
I'm like, "You can fuck off."

13:53.583 --> 13:55.500
-And...
-(laughter)

13:55.583 --> 13:58.083
I'm very aware that
that is a me problem.

13:58.166 --> 14:00.750
-And... I am working on it.
-(laughter)

14:00.834 --> 14:02.667
I think it's called
toxic masculinity.

14:02.750 --> 14:05.375
Now, I don't know much
about toxic masculinity.

14:05.458 --> 14:06.750
First I heard of it
was last year.

14:06.834 --> 14:08.417
One of my friends she said
to me, she was like,

14:08.500 --> 14:10.291
"Do you know
that you're a toxic man?"

14:10.375 --> 14:13.250
and I was like, hmm,
doesn't sound like me,
you dumb bitch.

14:13.333 --> 14:16.000
(laughter)

14:16.083 --> 14:17.458
Why don't you speak
when spoken to?

14:17.542 --> 14:20.542
-How about that?
That sound good?
-(laughter)

14:20.625 --> 14:22.417
(Daniel chuckles)

14:22.500 --> 14:24.375
And then I read a bunch
of articles about it,

14:24.458 --> 14:28.333
and I was like, oh boy!
Fucking oh-ho-ho!

14:28.417 --> 14:31.208
-Somebody's been following me.
-(laughter)

14:31.291 --> 14:35.000
-I'm not gonna change,
but at least I'm self-aware.
-(laughter)

14:35.083 --> 14:37.375
And that's half the battle.

14:37.458 --> 14:39.542
But not the half that matters.

14:39.625 --> 14:41.959
(laughter)

14:42.750 --> 14:44.583
First became aware of it
when my friend, she said to me,

14:44.667 --> 14:46.709
she was like, "You know, you're
quite bad with your emotions."

14:46.792 --> 14:48.875
And I was like, "No, I'm not.
You're bad with your emotions,

14:48.959 --> 14:51.583
because I know
when you're having them."

14:51.667 --> 14:54.250
(laughter)

14:54.333 --> 14:57.417
I just don't think my emotions
are anyone else's responsibility

14:57.500 --> 14:59.750
other than for my own.
So if I have a negative emotion,

14:59.834 --> 15:01.709
I'll just bottle it up
and keep it to myself.

15:01.792 --> 15:03.375
And, apparently,
that's quite unhealthy.

15:03.458 --> 15:05.375
And turns out
I also do the same

15:05.458 --> 15:07.041
with positive emotions
a lot of the time,

15:07.125 --> 15:09.083
and I just come across
as a miserable bastard.

15:09.166 --> 15:11.083
And I don't want that, man.

15:11.166 --> 15:14.542
I want my friends that I love
to know that I love them.

15:14.625 --> 15:16.458
I don't wanna be one of those
fucking closed up people.

15:16.542 --> 15:20.000
So I'm trying to, you know, get
better at saying nice things,

15:20.083 --> 15:24.000
but it's tough when
you're just not, you know,
fucking used to it.

15:24.083 --> 15:26.041
Like, to the men in the room,

15:26.125 --> 15:28.333
if you're anything like me
and you're struggling
with your emotions--

15:28.417 --> 15:29.917
I do recommend you get
in touch with them.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.375
'Cause it's not like
having a super power,

15:32.458 --> 15:36.500
but it is like having
every other man's kryptonite.

15:36.583 --> 15:39.208
Like, you can ruin
any man's day with emotions

15:39.291 --> 15:41.000
and it's the most fun
you'll ever have.

15:41.083 --> 15:43.166
Women, I finally
understand your games.

15:43.250 --> 15:45.250
-Like...
-(laughter)

15:45.333 --> 15:46.583
Next time you're with
one of your guy friends,

15:46.667 --> 15:49.166
if you want to fuck up
his whole afternoon,

15:49.250 --> 15:51.041
like really throw him
into disarray,

15:51.125 --> 15:54.083
look him dead in the eyes
and tell him that you love him.

15:54.166 --> 15:56.083
(laughter)

15:56.166 --> 15:59.917
-And just watch him not
be able to process that...
-(laughter)

16:00.041 --> 16:02.917
...with any level of maturity.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.041
Hey, Mark, I love you.

16:06.375 --> 16:09.542
(laughter)

16:10.083 --> 16:12.291
-"Why?"
-(laughter)

16:12.375 --> 16:14.542
You're one of my close friends,
I love you.

16:16.166 --> 16:19.333
-"Are-- are you dying?"
-(laughter)

16:19.417 --> 16:20.709
No. "Am I dying?"

16:20.792 --> 16:22.834
-Why would I know that?
-(laughter)

16:22.917 --> 16:25.458
"Are you trying to fuck me?"
No, I'm not trying to fuck you!

16:25.542 --> 16:26.792
"Yes you are.
If you love something,

16:26.875 --> 16:29.291
you fuck it.
You know the rules."

16:29.375 --> 16:31.458
(laughter)

16:31.542 --> 16:33.792
It's cliché to say,
women, you're better
with your emotions,

16:33.875 --> 16:35.291
but generally
you sort of tend to be.

16:35.375 --> 16:37.208
You create positive experiences
with each other,

16:37.291 --> 16:38.625
you're very kind to each other.

16:38.709 --> 16:40.375
I love watching women
compliment each other.

16:40.458 --> 16:42.875
Sincerely, I find it
very empowering.

16:42.959 --> 16:44.500
Especially if
they're shit-faced.

16:44.583 --> 16:47.125
-(laughter)
-There is nothing better

16:47.208 --> 16:49.250
than two drunk women
at 3 a.m. being like,

16:49.333 --> 16:52.500
"Oh my God, Sarah,
I absolutely love your tits!"

16:52.583 --> 16:55.625
"Shut up, Jessica.
I would cut off my tits
and give them to you

16:55.709 --> 16:58.917
if I could have a day in that."
(kissing)

16:59.000 --> 17:00.375
(laughter)

17:00.458 --> 17:02.125
It's very, very empowering.

17:02.208 --> 17:04.625
And you're not really allowed
to do that as a man.

17:04.709 --> 17:06.916
Just, "Hey, Steve, nice dick!"
Doesn't work.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
(laughter)

17:09.083 --> 17:10.416
Doesn't work
and that's a real shame,

17:10.500 --> 17:12.583
'cause Steve's got
a real nice dick.

17:13.500 --> 17:15.916
He's got a real nice dick
and he won't let me
see it anymore.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.208
(laughter)

17:20.416 --> 17:23.666
-(laughter)
-(Daniel chuckles)

17:25.916 --> 17:27.583
So, you know,
I'm trying to, you know...

17:27.666 --> 17:29.750
I'm trying to read
a bit more about it.

17:29.834 --> 17:31.792
It's a bit tough reading
about toxic masculinity,

17:31.875 --> 17:35.041
because in all honesty,
I like being a man
and I think it's fun,

17:35.125 --> 17:38.000
and up until now, like, I didn't
realize any of it was shit.

17:38.083 --> 17:40.083
'Cause for me,
all masculinity means to me

17:40.166 --> 17:42.083
is it's just me
and ten of my friends

17:42.166 --> 17:44.208
drinking until one of us dies.

17:44.291 --> 17:47.083
And the one that does die,
we won't attend his funeral,

17:47.166 --> 17:49.417
because he died like a bitch
and we don't honor bitches.

17:49.500 --> 17:51.166
(laughter)

17:51.250 --> 17:53.542
I don't know how you expect
me to pay my respects

17:53.625 --> 17:55.542
to a man that can't
handle the sesh.

17:55.625 --> 17:57.458
-That's not something...
-(laughter)

17:57.542 --> 17:59.208
...I have within my repertoire.

17:59.291 --> 18:01.709
Like, what do you want
me to do at his funeral?

18:01.792 --> 18:03.083
Pour a drink out in his grave?

18:03.166 --> 18:04.875
Be like, "Still can't
handle it, can you cunt?"

18:05.000 --> 18:07.125
-(laughter)
-Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha!

18:07.208 --> 18:09.875
-(spits)
-(laughter)

18:09.959 --> 18:12.417
-Your father was a pussy.
-(laughter)

18:12.500 --> 18:15.375
-(spits)
-(laughter)

18:20.542 --> 18:24.750
I feel like there's
a lot of shit that's
not toxic masculinity

18:24.834 --> 18:27.291
that's currently being thrown
under the toxic masculinity bus.

18:27.375 --> 18:29.000
I see it happen
on Twitter a lot.

18:29.083 --> 18:31.500
People say like, "This is what
toxic masculinity looks like."

18:31.583 --> 18:34.417
I'm like, no, no, no, that's
just a thing that cunts do.

18:34.500 --> 18:35.750
(laughter)

18:35.834 --> 18:37.709
Now, I'm both
a toxic man and a cunt

18:37.792 --> 18:40.458
-and I'm willing
to give up one of those.
-(laughter)

18:40.542 --> 18:43.208
Here's a thing that I do not
think is exclusive to men.

18:43.291 --> 18:48.834
I think bullying is
one of the funnest things
in the entire world.

18:48.917 --> 18:51.041
Now, allow me
to clarify that statement

18:51.125 --> 18:54.291
for all of you nerds currently
getting PTSD flashbacks...

18:54.375 --> 18:55.625
(laughter)

18:55.709 --> 18:58.375
...to the wedgies you rightfully
received in high school.

18:58.458 --> 19:01.625
When I say bullying, I do not
mean in any way, shape, or form,

19:01.709 --> 19:03.792
bullying someone society deems
weaker or less than you,

19:03.875 --> 19:07.041
and I especially don't mean
ganging up on somebody
you hate or dislike.

19:07.125 --> 19:08.709
I mean bullying your friends.

19:08.792 --> 19:11.875
I think there is
no higher form of love

19:11.959 --> 19:13.667
available as a human being

19:13.750 --> 19:15.792
than staring your best friend
dead in the eyes

19:15.875 --> 19:18.041
and just destroying
every life decision

19:18.125 --> 19:21.542
they have ever made
up until that moment in time,

19:21.625 --> 19:23.250
with no mercy, no remorse.

19:23.333 --> 19:25.291
And the entire time,
they're just sat there
being like,

19:25.375 --> 19:27.291
"My turn soon, cunt.
See if I give a shit."

19:27.375 --> 19:29.542
(laughter)

19:29.625 --> 19:32.166
"Think you're perfect
do you, princess?"

19:32.250 --> 19:33.500
(laughter)

19:33.583 --> 19:35.333
And that's not
exclusive to men.

19:35.417 --> 19:38.500
If you're anything like me,
which I'm going to assume
most of you are

19:38.583 --> 19:41.667
-since this is how you
choose to spend your time...
-(laughter)

19:41.750 --> 19:44.458
...you're quite a nice
person consciously.

19:44.542 --> 19:45.875
It's an active decision.

19:45.959 --> 19:49.750
But your internal monologue
is the most barbaric roast

19:49.834 --> 19:52.583
of any human being
that has the audacity

19:52.667 --> 19:55.458
-to walk into
your field of vision.
-(laughter)

19:55.542 --> 19:57.000
It's not even
a conscious thing.

19:57.083 --> 19:58.375
You're just walking
down the street,
being like,

19:58.458 --> 20:00.208
"I'm in a good mood."
And your brain's like,

20:00.291 --> 20:04.417
"Wrong. Cunt, cunt, cunt,
ugly baby, shit dog."

20:04.500 --> 20:07.208
-And you're like...
-(laughter)

20:08.417 --> 20:11.583
-"Why am I like this?"
-(laughter)

20:11.667 --> 20:14.875
-"Who hurt me?"
-(laughter)

20:14.959 --> 20:16.208
I would never ever, ever, ever

20:16.291 --> 20:19.166
say any of these
horrible thoughts out loud.

20:20.041 --> 20:22.000
But I do know five cunts
who would love them!

20:22.083 --> 20:25.792
-Group chat! And then...
-(laughter)

20:26.500 --> 20:29.875
I'm in a WhatsApp group
with ten male comedians,

20:29.959 --> 20:32.333
-so yeah.
-(laughter)

20:32.417 --> 20:35.417
-Our banter is unforgivable.
-(laughter)

20:35.500 --> 20:38.542
I say genuinely
career-ending things

20:38.625 --> 20:40.792
in that group every single day,

20:40.875 --> 20:43.792
and all for the sake of getting
three cry-face laugh emojis.

20:43.875 --> 20:45.625
(laughter)

20:45.709 --> 20:49.458
-Is it worth it? You're goddamn
fucking right it's worth it.
-(laughter)

20:49.542 --> 20:50.709
Couple months ago in our group,

20:50.792 --> 20:53.000
one of our closest friends,
his dog died,

20:53.083 --> 20:55.583
which is obviously devastating.

20:55.667 --> 20:58.542
But not as devastating
as the memes we made.

20:58.625 --> 21:01.375
(audience groans, laughs)

21:02.125 --> 21:04.583
He didn't even tell us
his dog was dead,

21:04.667 --> 21:06.500
'cause he knew
we'd make fun of him.

21:06.583 --> 21:10.000
We had to find out from
his wife's Facebook page.

21:10.083 --> 21:11.750
She did a sad
little post about it,

21:11.834 --> 21:13.250
we all screen grabbed it,
put it in the group.

21:13.333 --> 21:16.917
-We're like, "Hi,
is your dog dead?"
-(laughter)

21:17.000 --> 21:18.917
And he was like "Yeah,"
and we were like,

21:19.000 --> 21:22.250
"Aah! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

21:22.333 --> 21:24.583
That'll teach you
to love something!"

21:24.667 --> 21:26.583
(laughter)

21:26.667 --> 21:28.166
And then we made fun
of his dead dog for an hour.

21:28.250 --> 21:30.917
Now, the reason we made
fun of his dead dog

21:31.000 --> 21:32.500
isn't 'cause we were glad
the dog was dead.

21:32.583 --> 21:35.959
We loved that dog.
He was such a good dog.
I miss that dog.

21:36.041 --> 21:38.959
The reason we made fun of
his dead dog isn't because
we find dead dogs funny.

21:39.041 --> 21:41.709
Very rarely do we find
dead dogs funny.

21:41.792 --> 21:43.291
The reason we made
fun of his dead dog

21:43.375 --> 21:46.458
is for the same reason that
most people make horrible jokes

21:46.542 --> 21:47.959
after something bad happens.

21:48.041 --> 21:49.208
And it's not
because they're evil,

21:49.291 --> 21:50.458
and it's not
because they're malicious,

21:50.542 --> 21:51.792
and it's not
because they're heartless.

21:51.875 --> 21:54.750
It's because the joke
pops in to your head.

21:54.834 --> 21:56.625
-And that's it.
-(laughter)

21:56.709 --> 21:59.750
Something bad happens,
and you go, "Oh, no!"

21:59.834 --> 22:01.792
And your brain goes,
"Say this, though."

22:01.875 --> 22:05.208
-(laughter)
-And that's it.

22:05.291 --> 22:08.000
And if you don't say the joke,
it's not like it fucks off.

22:08.083 --> 22:10.709
It just sits there getting
funnier and funnier

22:10.792 --> 22:13.458
and funnier and funnier
and it begins to rot your brain,

22:13.542 --> 22:15.041
and that's how
you get brain cancer.

22:15.125 --> 22:18.834
-I am a scientist. It's...
-(laughter)

22:18.917 --> 22:20.333
It's like having diarrhea,

22:20.417 --> 22:23.333
-holding it in
doesn't achieve anything.
-(laughter)

22:23.417 --> 22:24.917
You just have to admit
that you're unwell

22:25.000 --> 22:27.417
and be like, "I'm very sorry.
I'm incredibly sick.

22:27.500 --> 22:29.166
"I have to get this
out of my system,

22:29.250 --> 22:30.959
otherwise I might explode."

22:31.041 --> 22:32.500
-(screams)
-(laughter)

22:32.583 --> 22:35.333
"Thank you for your patience.
Sorry for your loss."

22:35.417 --> 22:36.834
(laughter)

22:36.917 --> 22:40.458
So, we spend an hour just making
silly jokes about his dead dog.

22:40.542 --> 22:42.750
I say "we."
I didn't.

22:42.834 --> 22:44.500
(laughter)

22:44.583 --> 22:46.375
I spent 45 minutes of that hour

22:46.458 --> 22:48.166
very carefully
photoshopping an image

22:48.250 --> 22:53.583
-of Thanos clicking
his fingers and his dog...
-(laughter)

22:53.667 --> 22:56.875
...disappearing from the arms
of his four-year-old daughter.

22:57.000 --> 23:01.125
-And...
-(laughter and applause)

23:02.709 --> 23:05.208
You'll-- you'll never
convince me that

23:05.291 --> 23:08.959
that's not the funniest
thing I've ever done
in my goddamn life.

23:09.959 --> 23:12.375
Five cry-face laugh emojis
from all my boys.

23:12.458 --> 23:14.875
I bowled a perfect game.
You never see that.

23:14.959 --> 23:17.208
-Never happens.
-(laughter)

23:17.291 --> 23:18.583
But eventually,
at the end of the hour,

23:18.667 --> 23:20.834
all the horrible jokes were
out of our system.

23:20.917 --> 23:22.000
I was straight in.

23:22.083 --> 23:23.750
I was like, hey man,
we hope you're okay.

23:23.834 --> 23:25.709
We hope the kids are okay,
and we hope you know
we're just joking.

23:25.792 --> 23:28.834
And he was straight in.
He was like, "Don't fucking
condescend to me."

23:28.917 --> 23:31.083
-(laughter)
-"I'm very aware
they were just jokes.

23:31.166 --> 23:32.875
"I appreciate your attempts
to cheer me up.

23:32.959 --> 23:34.542
They did work.
I love you, boys."

23:34.625 --> 23:38.333
-And we were like, "Ew!"
And then...
-(laughter)

23:38.417 --> 23:40.417
And I was like, can I ask
how the dog died?

23:40.500 --> 23:42.625
He was like, "Yeah man, we just,
we had to get it put down."

23:42.709 --> 23:44.333
I'm like, man, I'm genuinely
sorry to hear that.

23:44.417 --> 23:46.417
Having a dog put down,
it's a horrible thing
to go through.

23:46.500 --> 23:49.625
All jokes aside, why did you
have to get the dog put down?

23:49.709 --> 23:53.250
"Oh, it was showing
signs of dementia."
(snickers)

23:53.333 --> 23:57.291
(laughter)

24:00.875 --> 24:03.834
(laughter)

24:06.166 --> 24:08.750
-Boys, come back.
-(laughter)

24:08.834 --> 24:12.875
-No, it gets so much better.
It gets way better.
-(laughter)

24:12.959 --> 24:16.542
I'm sorry.
Dogs get dementia?

24:16.625 --> 24:19.750
-"Yeah they do, Daniel.
It's pretty serious."
-(Daniel snickers)

24:19.834 --> 24:21.291
(laughter)

24:21.375 --> 24:24.291
Can you just--
can you--? I'll ask!

24:24.375 --> 24:26.291
(laughter)

24:26.375 --> 24:30.750
-Can you just describe
the first symptom please?
-(laughter)

24:30.834 --> 24:34.125
I just-- I really just need
to understand the moment
when you realized

24:34.208 --> 24:38.959
that your dog had
the human disease dementia.

24:39.041 --> 24:41.041
Just talk me through that.
What was that like?

24:41.125 --> 24:42.542
"I'm gonna take
the dog for a walk."

24:42.625 --> 24:45.458
(meows)
"Oh, that's fucked!"

24:45.542 --> 24:47.709
(laughter)

24:49.458 --> 24:51.458
(whispers):
"I think it's best we kill it."

24:51.542 --> 24:54.583
-(laughter)
-(mouthing)

24:56.125 --> 24:59.542
(laughter)

25:05.208 --> 25:08.125
-(laughter)
-(Daniel chuckles)

25:11.166 --> 25:13.709
I didn't realize that
the male ego was fragile.

25:13.792 --> 25:15.709
Like, I'm quite
a confident person,

25:15.792 --> 25:18.542
and I always thought that was
quite a fucking strong thing
that I was secure in.

25:18.625 --> 25:20.625
And then I was just
in a conversation
with a bunch of girls,

25:20.709 --> 25:24.417
and one of them was like,
"Fucking hell, the male ego
is so fragile!"

25:24.500 --> 25:25.875
And I was like, no, it's not!

25:25.959 --> 25:28.000
-Oh, there it is.
-(laughter)

25:28.083 --> 25:30.875
-Ah, I see.
-(laughter)

25:30.959 --> 25:34.250
-I'm the problem.
-(laughter)

25:34.333 --> 25:37.959
To me, like, masculinity it's--
it's the caveman in our brain

25:38.041 --> 25:40.125
that we've not been able
to breed out through evolution.

25:40.208 --> 25:41.667
Evolution is an incredibly
slow process,

25:41.750 --> 25:45.208
so we still have some instincts
that are so fucking ancient.

25:45.291 --> 25:47.125
Like, if you take a baby--
like a brand-new baby,

25:47.208 --> 25:49.625
a freshly squeezed baby
straight from the tree...

25:49.709 --> 25:51.291
(laughter)

25:51.375 --> 25:54.291
...if you press
the palm of its hand,
it will instinctively close.

25:54.375 --> 25:56.709
This reaction exists from
when we used to be apes

25:56.792 --> 25:58.000
and our mothers
used to have fur,

25:58.083 --> 25:59.709
and that's how we'd
hold on to our mothers

25:59.792 --> 26:00.959
as she swung from tree to tree.

26:01.041 --> 26:03.458
That reaction is still
like a baby's now.

26:03.542 --> 26:06.041
So, there's a lot
of stuff in there that
we don't need anymore,

26:06.125 --> 26:07.375
'cause we're not
hunter-gatherers.

26:07.458 --> 26:08.875
We don't need fight or flight,

26:08.959 --> 26:11.041
for an example,
as a reaction to things.

26:11.125 --> 26:14.250
It's a very archaic way
of dealing with modern problems,
but it's still in there.

26:14.333 --> 26:17.041
As a man you have
to learn to not listen

26:17.125 --> 26:19.041
to a lot of
the caveman instincts,

26:19.125 --> 26:21.083
because this isn't
the smart caveman.

26:21.166 --> 26:23.250
This isn't the one
that discovered fire.

26:23.333 --> 26:25.917
This is the one
that worked out it was hot.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.750
-Like...
-(laughter)

26:27.834 --> 26:31.458
-He shouldn't be running
the ship at any point.
-(laughter)

26:31.542 --> 26:33.417
I'm slowly coming to terms
with my caveman nature

26:33.500 --> 26:36.417
of understanding his bullshit
reactions to things.

26:36.500 --> 26:38.417
He sees masculine
things as strong

26:38.500 --> 26:39.834
and feminine things as weak.

26:39.917 --> 26:42.583
And for most of my life,
it stopped me doing things

26:42.667 --> 26:44.000
that society deemed feminine.

26:44.083 --> 26:47.041
And it's such a fucking pathetic
way to deal with things.

26:47.125 --> 26:48.792
And I'm getting better at it
and I want to,

26:48.875 --> 26:51.250
'cause there's a lot of shit
that society deems feminine

26:51.333 --> 26:54.250
-that I fucking want.
-(laughter)

26:54.333 --> 26:56.709
For example, ladies you, uh...

26:56.792 --> 26:58.959
you get to go
to the bathroom together.

26:59.041 --> 27:01.583
(laughter)

27:01.667 --> 27:03.667
-I want that.
-(laughter)

27:03.750 --> 27:05.458
And it's nothing
you can give us.

27:05.542 --> 27:07.458
You as a gender,
you have decided that you go
to the bathroom together,

27:07.542 --> 27:09.834
'cause of course you do.
It makes perfect sense
to do it that way.

27:09.917 --> 27:12.417
Men, for some reason, we insist
on going to the toilet alone.

27:12.500 --> 27:16.166
And nobody has ever been able
to rationally explain to me why.

27:16.250 --> 27:18.250
Have you ever seen women
going to the toilet together?

27:18.333 --> 27:20.625
-Like, it's fucking incredible!
-(laughter)

27:20.709 --> 27:22.959
They'll just be sat there
drinking cocktails,

27:23.041 --> 27:25.542
talking about science--
hashtag feminism.

27:25.625 --> 27:27.959
-(laughter)
-And then...
halfway through,

27:28.041 --> 27:30.333
one of them will just go,
"I'm going to go to the toilet."

27:30.417 --> 27:34.625
And immediately three
of her friends will go,
"Ah! We'll come too!"

27:34.709 --> 27:36.125
And they get up, and they skip,

27:36.208 --> 27:38.250
and they link arms, it's like
the start of The Hobbit.

27:38.333 --> 27:40.625
-It's beautiful!
-(laughter)

27:40.709 --> 27:41.959
Yet when I want to take a piss,

27:42.041 --> 27:43.917
I gotta do a goddamn
Frodo solo mission.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.375
It makes so much sense
to go the bathroom together.

27:46.458 --> 27:49.417
-And I've been doing a lot
of research on this.
-(laughter)

27:49.500 --> 27:52.500
And by research, I mean staring
at women going to the toilets.

27:52.583 --> 27:54.125
(laughter)

27:54.208 --> 27:55.709
To the men in the room,
I don't know if you know this--

27:55.792 --> 27:57.583
'cause I fucking didn't--
but there's a lot of the time

27:57.667 --> 28:00.500
two women will go into
the same cubicle together,

28:00.583 --> 28:03.417
only one of them
needs to pee.

28:03.500 --> 28:04.709
(laughter)

28:04.792 --> 28:07.875
The other one is just there
to keep her company.

28:07.959 --> 28:10.375
(laughter)

28:11.917 --> 28:14.166
"Are ya having a good pee?"

28:14.250 --> 28:18.000
"I am having a good pee.
Yeah, thanks."

28:18.083 --> 28:20.333
"How's Darren?"
"Oh, you know."

28:20.417 --> 28:24.000
-I want that!
-(laughter)

28:24.083 --> 28:28.166
I've had some of the most
brutal shits of my entire life

28:28.250 --> 28:31.208
in public bathrooms that would
have been made way easier

28:31.291 --> 28:33.542
if one of my bro's was there
holding my hand!

28:33.625 --> 28:35.625
(laughter)

28:35.709 --> 28:37.041
"Come on, Daniel, push!"

28:37.125 --> 28:40.458
-But it's so painful!
-(laughter)

28:40.542 --> 28:42.583
"Come on, breathe!
Just like we practiced."

28:42.667 --> 28:45.000
Ha-ha! I'll name it after you!

28:45.083 --> 28:49.291
(laughter and applause)

28:50.917 --> 28:53.917
-Do you wanna hold it?
-(laughter)

28:58.041 --> 29:00.625
Obviously there are other
reasons why women go
to the bathroom together.

29:00.709 --> 29:03.125
One of the main reasons being
sometimes one of you is wearing

29:03.208 --> 29:06.709
a playsuit or a romper
and you need your fucking
Formula One team there.

29:06.792 --> 29:08.625
(laughter)

29:08.709 --> 29:10.792
Oh, I know your secrets, ladies.

29:10.875 --> 29:12.083
(laughter)

29:12.166 --> 29:13.625
To the men that might not
get that reference,

29:13.709 --> 29:15.625
if you ever see more than
two women going to the bathroom,

29:15.709 --> 29:17.041
nine times out of ten
it's because

29:17.125 --> 29:19.208
one of them is wearing
an all-in-one monstrosity,

29:19.291 --> 29:21.041
and she needs at least
three of her sisters to be like,

29:21.125 --> 29:23.625
(zips) "Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go!"

29:23.709 --> 29:25.250
(laughter)

29:25.333 --> 29:27.583
Because without them there,
she can get out of it

29:27.667 --> 29:29.959
and then she's just naked
until the bouncer arrives.

29:30.041 --> 29:32.458
(laughter)

29:36.583 --> 29:38.166
And I've tried, man.

29:38.250 --> 29:40.834
I have tried getting
my guy friends to come
to the toilet with me.

29:40.917 --> 29:42.291
Does not work.

29:42.375 --> 29:45.291
-It makes them
very uncomfortable.
-(laughter)

29:45.375 --> 29:47.458
If you thought me telling them
I loved them scared them,

29:47.542 --> 29:50.583
-try inviting them
to the bathroom.
-(laughter)

29:50.667 --> 29:52.500
Don't do those two things
in a row, by the way.

29:52.583 --> 29:54.291
(laughter)

29:54.375 --> 29:56.959
Hey, Mark, I love you.
I'm going to go to the toilet.

29:57.041 --> 29:59.583
(laughter)

30:00.542 --> 30:02.375
(laughter)

30:04.125 --> 30:06.208
(laughter)

30:06.959 --> 30:09.417
(laughter)

30:10.750 --> 30:15.041
(laughter)

30:16.083 --> 30:17.291
(laughter)

30:17.375 --> 30:19.291
-Mark!
-(laughter)

30:19.375 --> 30:20.542
"But I don't need to pee."

30:20.625 --> 30:23.041
-You don't need to need to pee.
-(laughter)

30:23.125 --> 30:25.709
Just come be with me
while I pee.

30:26.375 --> 30:28.000
"Why?"
I'll miss you.

30:28.083 --> 30:30.250
(laughter)

30:30.333 --> 30:32.667
-Once, it's worked.
-(laughter)

30:32.750 --> 30:34.917
-I remember the day so vividly.
-(laughter)

30:35.000 --> 30:38.291
November 22nd last year,
Queens Arm pub in Edinburgh.

30:38.375 --> 30:40.083
I turned to one of my boys
and I was like, hey man,

30:40.166 --> 30:41.917
I'm going to go to the toilet.
Do you want to come?

30:42.000 --> 30:43.875
He was like,
"Fuck yeah, Sloss,
I'll join you."

30:43.959 --> 30:45.166
I was like...

30:45.250 --> 30:48.542
(laughter)

30:48.625 --> 30:52.583
-I'm making a difference!
-(laughter)

30:52.667 --> 30:55.500
You should have seen
the disappointment on his face

30:55.583 --> 30:57.458
when I did not have cocaine.

30:57.542 --> 31:04.458
(laughter and applause)

31:06.667 --> 31:08.834
He was a very angry man.

31:08.917 --> 31:11.375
(laughter)

31:11.458 --> 31:14.166
"Why is your dick out?!"
Why is your wallet out?!

31:14.250 --> 31:16.917
(laughter)

31:20.792 --> 31:22.959
I am not that type of lady.

31:23.041 --> 31:26.125
(laughter)

31:31.083 --> 31:34.000
Just trying to fix
the shit in my brain.

31:34.083 --> 31:37.333
I'm still not 100% happy
with who I am as a person.

31:37.417 --> 31:41.959
Especially-- do you ever have
yourself having thoughts that
you hope to fuck aren't yours?

31:42.041 --> 31:43.542
(laughter)

31:43.625 --> 31:46.375
Like, I can find myself
having opinions that
I don't even agree with,

31:46.458 --> 31:48.792
and I don't know
how that works.

31:49.417 --> 31:51.291
Just be sat in my house
being a nice person,

31:51.375 --> 31:53.208
then just something horrible
will cross my mind.

31:53.291 --> 31:56.959
I'm like, fucking some cunt
better have walked by
with his Bluetooth on.

31:57.041 --> 31:58.875
(laughter)

31:59.000 --> 32:01.959
Like, and I don't think--
I don't think it's like--
I don't think I'm a bad person.

32:02.041 --> 32:07.667
I think just a lot of the time
I haven't consciously updated
all of my opinions yet.

32:07.750 --> 32:10.333
Like, I still have
some opinions from 2005,

32:10.417 --> 32:12.000
and occasionally when I'm drunk

32:12.083 --> 32:14.417
my brain will just go,
and here's the classics.

32:14.500 --> 32:16.542
-And...
-(laughter)

32:16.625 --> 32:18.542
They're not necessarily
hateful opinions.

32:18.625 --> 32:20.875
they're just shitty opinions
that a 15-year-old has.

32:20.959 --> 32:23.083
Like, the first time I became
aware of one, I was at a party,

32:23.166 --> 32:25.417
and I was talking to this really
fucking interesting girl.

32:25.500 --> 32:26.750
We had a good conversation,

32:26.834 --> 32:28.041
and then in the midst of it,
she was just like,

32:28.125 --> 32:29.458
"What is it that you
do for a living?"

32:29.542 --> 32:30.625
And I was like,
oh, I'm a comedian.

32:30.709 --> 32:31.917
What do you do for a living?

32:32.000 --> 32:33.250
And she was like,
"Oh, I'm a footballer,"

32:33.333 --> 32:35.750
as in she was
a professional soccer player.

32:35.834 --> 32:37.583
And I was like, oh, cool!

32:37.667 --> 32:39.917
But my internal monologue
was just like,

32:40.000 --> 32:42.542
"I'm a much better
footballer than you!"

32:42.625 --> 32:44.834
(laughter)

32:45.709 --> 32:48.250
-And that is not true.
-(laughter)

32:48.333 --> 32:52.166
She's a professional,
and I haven't played football
since I was 15 years old.

32:52.250 --> 32:54.125
But I also haven't consciously
updated my opinion

32:54.208 --> 32:56.917
of myself playing football
since I was 15 years old.
That's what I mean.

32:57.000 --> 32:58.750
I would argue these aren't
even my opinions.

32:58.834 --> 33:01.458
They're more like the echoes
of a less educated me.

33:01.542 --> 33:03.834
They are the residue
of ignorance.

33:03.917 --> 33:06.250
Now, every single one of us
has ignorant opinions.

33:06.333 --> 33:08.041
And if you think you don't
have any ignorant opinions,

33:08.125 --> 33:11.166
-it's because you've not
said them all out loud yet.
-(laughter)

33:11.250 --> 33:13.166
A lot of the time most things
sound fine in your head,

33:13.250 --> 33:15.125
but when you say them out loud
for the first time, you're like,

33:15.208 --> 33:18.417
-aah, fuck!
-(laughter)

33:18.500 --> 33:20.834
-That's definitely wrong.
-(laughter)

33:20.917 --> 33:22.625
I'm going to have to stand
by that for three weeks

33:22.709 --> 33:25.750
-for no other reason
other than pride.
-(laughter)

33:25.834 --> 33:29.083
And then pretend I read
a book that changed my mind.

33:29.166 --> 33:30.917
(laughter)

33:31.000 --> 33:33.500
Takes being involved
in a conversation with someone

33:33.583 --> 33:36.458
where you're talking about
something that, you know,

33:36.542 --> 33:38.041
that you haven't thought
about for ten years,

33:38.125 --> 33:40.834
so of course the opinion
is ten years out of date.

33:40.917 --> 33:42.959
I was talking to one of my boys,
one of my WhatsApp boys,

33:43.041 --> 33:45.166
-one of my (grunts) boys, right?
-(laughter)

33:45.250 --> 33:47.000
And he'd been seeing
a girl for, like, ages.

33:47.083 --> 33:49.375
They'd been on, like, ten dates
and they'd only kissed,

33:49.458 --> 33:52.333
which is fine, that's fine,
that's fine, that's fine.

33:52.417 --> 33:54.375
(laughter)

33:54.458 --> 33:56.750
And after, like, the tenth date
of only kissing, he was like,

33:56.834 --> 33:58.417
"Man, I think
she really likes me."

33:58.500 --> 34:00.750
And I was like,
she fucking doesn't, man.

34:00.834 --> 34:02.166
(laughter)

34:02.250 --> 34:03.417
"Oh, how can you tell?"

34:03.500 --> 34:05.208
Because your nose still
smells like your nose.

34:05.291 --> 34:06.709
It's a very simple equa--

34:06.792 --> 34:10.250
(groans, laughter)

34:13.250 --> 34:14.917
First of all,
if you get that reference,

34:15.000 --> 34:18.875
-you're not better
than me, okay?
-(laughter)

34:18.958 --> 34:23.208
You don't get to
understand the reference
and then be upset

34:23.291 --> 34:26.708
-because I know how you
understand the reference.
-(laughter)

34:26.792 --> 34:30.291
It's the same way I understand
the fucking reference.

34:30.792 --> 34:33.375
You don't get to sit there
being like, "Sir, how dare you?"

34:33.458 --> 34:34.833
-(laughter)
-"How dare--

34:34.917 --> 34:36.708
"Barely were the words
out of your mouth

34:36.792 --> 34:38.792
before my mother was like,
'Yeah, done that!'"

34:38.875 --> 34:41.542
-(laughter)
-(Daniel chuckling)

34:41.625 --> 34:43.083
Look, I respect her.

34:43.166 --> 34:44.958
Uh, I respect her
for having boundaries

34:45.041 --> 34:47.125
and I respect him for
respecting her boundaries.

34:47.208 --> 34:49.542
I'm still going to make fun
of him though because fuck him.

34:49.625 --> 34:51.208
-So...
-(laughter)

34:51.291 --> 34:54.458
Eventually they had sex,
and I was happy for them.

34:55.375 --> 34:56.417
And I was talking
to him afterwards

34:56.500 --> 34:57.875
and I was like,
how was the sex?

34:57.959 --> 34:59.709
And he was like, "Oh, man,
it was the best sex ever."

34:59.792 --> 35:01.375
I was like,
it wasn't, but okay.

35:01.458 --> 35:03.291
-(laughter)
-He was like,
"Yeah, it was, right?

35:03.375 --> 35:05.583
-At one point
we were making love."
-(gags)

35:05.667 --> 35:08.041
(laughter)

35:08.125 --> 35:10.375
-I'm very mature.
-(laughter)

35:10.458 --> 35:12.250
"So, at one point
we were making love.

35:12.333 --> 35:16.542
"And while we were making love,
she shoved her finger
up my ass, right?"

35:16.625 --> 35:19.250
And then he kept talking.

35:19.333 --> 35:21.417
(laughter)

35:21.500 --> 35:24.917
-And I had stopped listening.
-(laughter)

35:25.000 --> 35:27.375
The second he said she shoved
her finger up my ass,

35:27.458 --> 35:31.709
my brain just went, "Hey Sloss,
you have an opinion on that."

35:31.792 --> 35:33.625
(laughter)

35:33.709 --> 35:36.083
-And I was like, do I?
-(laughter)

35:36.166 --> 35:39.583
-Oh, I wonder what it could be.
-(laughter)

35:39.667 --> 35:42.875
I bet it's progressive.

35:42.959 --> 35:45.709
(laughter)

35:47.250 --> 35:48.667
Now, all my newer opinions--

35:48.750 --> 35:50.583
all the ones I've developed
in about the last ten years so--

35:50.667 --> 35:51.959
they're stored at
the front of my brain

35:52.041 --> 35:53.959
in the easily accessible
part of the library.

35:54.041 --> 35:55.458
You walk into
the front of my brain,

35:55.542 --> 35:57.041
all my opinions
are laid out there

35:57.125 --> 35:58.959
in easily digestible
brochure format.

35:59.041 --> 36:01.834
There's a comments section,
they can all be updated
at a moment's notice.

36:01.917 --> 36:03.625
It's a very, very
efficient system.

36:03.709 --> 36:05.333
All of my older opinions
are stored

36:05.417 --> 36:07.917
in a fucked up warehouse
in the back of my brain.

36:08.000 --> 36:11.500
Understand I do not want any
of these opinions anymore,

36:11.583 --> 36:14.291
but my brain has decided to hold
onto them for no other reason

36:14.375 --> 36:18.000
than it's an overbearing mother
being like, "You never know!"

36:18.083 --> 36:19.458
(laughter)

36:19.542 --> 36:22.166
It's a ramshackle clusterfuck
of different horrible opinions.

36:22.250 --> 36:24.834
Some of them are set in stone,
and that's annoying.

36:24.917 --> 36:26.959
But the whole place is run
by a lovely old man.

36:27.041 --> 36:29.375
His name is Nigel,
he wears a monocle,
you'd like him.

36:29.458 --> 36:31.166
-Now...
-(laughter)

36:31.250 --> 36:33.750
Occasionally I've got
to pop up to the back
of my brain to talk to Nigel

36:33.834 --> 36:35.166
to find out what
my old opinions are.

36:35.250 --> 36:37.417
So I pop upstairs--
he's always happy to see me.

36:37.500 --> 36:39.041
I'll be like, hey Nigel.

36:39.125 --> 36:43.125
and he's like, "Mister...
Mr. Sloss, how are you?"

36:43.208 --> 36:45.166
I'm good, Nige. I'm just--

36:45.250 --> 36:46.875
just looking for
an old opinion of mine.

36:46.959 --> 36:49.083
"Oh, you've certainly come
to the right place.

36:49.166 --> 36:50.917
"What older opinion
can I interest you in?

36:51.041 --> 36:53.583
Oh, is it your crush
on the Olsen twins?"

36:53.667 --> 36:56.166
-(laughter)
-Oh, no, no.

36:56.250 --> 36:59.041
-That is fucking old though.
-(laughter)

36:59.125 --> 37:01.041
You can actually just
throw that out, Nigel.

37:01.125 --> 37:03.959
-I think they're dead.
-(laughter)

37:04.041 --> 37:07.375
"Oh, okay, well,
what opinion is it you're
after then, Mr. Sloss?"

37:07.458 --> 37:10.417
Well, Nigel, it's just
I'm talking to one of
my boys out there,

37:10.500 --> 37:13.792
and I was just wondering,
do I have any opinions on, um...

37:15.542 --> 37:17.875
(quietly):
Do I have any opinions
on stuff going up my butt?

37:17.959 --> 37:19.542
(laughter)

37:19.625 --> 37:21.625
"Stuff going up your butt?"

37:21.709 --> 37:23.208
Aye.

37:23.291 --> 37:24.750
"Um..."

37:26.875 --> 37:29.458
(laughter)

37:32.125 --> 37:34.166
(laughter)

37:36.583 --> 37:38.333
(laughter)

37:41.125 --> 37:44.458
"Aye. Aye, you do.
I can't see it there.

37:44.542 --> 37:46.959
"But if I remember correctly,
you definitely thought about it.

37:47.041 --> 37:49.667
"It was only once
and it was either 2004 or--

37:49.750 --> 37:51.625
"My memory's not what
it used to be, Mr. Sloss.

37:51.709 --> 37:53.458
"2005, yes, that was it. 2005.

37:53.542 --> 37:55.750
"You were 15 years old,
your parents had gone
to the cinema,

37:55.834 --> 37:56.959
"and you had to babysit
your brothers.

37:57.041 --> 37:58.291
"Once you put
your brothers to sleep,

37:58.375 --> 38:00.250
"you were watching porn
on the family computer.

38:00.333 --> 38:02.458
"And in one of the pornos,
the woman shoved her finger
up the man's ass.

38:02.542 --> 38:05.500
You were very confused.
You thought she was
trying to reset him."

38:05.583 --> 38:11.208
(laughter and applause)

38:13.333 --> 38:15.417
(laughter)

38:17.583 --> 38:18.959
"Here you go, Mr. Sloss, 2005.

38:19.041 --> 38:20.917
"It'll be in here somewhere.
Just give me two seconds.

38:21.000 --> 38:22.709
-Okay."
-(blows)

38:23.750 --> 38:26.125
(laughter)

38:26.208 --> 38:28.333
(muttering):
"Stuff going up your butt...

38:28.417 --> 38:30.083
"Stuff going
up your butt...

38:30.166 --> 38:33.333
-(laughter)
-"Stuff--
Oh, your favorite Pokemon!

38:33.417 --> 38:35.792
-"No? Well...
-(laughter)

38:35.875 --> 38:38.625
-"Jigglypuff and...
-(laughter)

38:38.709 --> 38:41.250
"Oh, here we go, 2005.
Here we go, Mr. Sloss, 2005.
15 years old...

38:41.333 --> 38:43.625
"Stuff going up your butt,
stuff going up your butt...

38:43.709 --> 38:46.375
-Gay!"
-(laughter)

38:47.667 --> 38:50.917
-Aah, no!
-(laughter)

38:51.834 --> 38:55.792
Nigel, I can't have that
be my opinion on that.

38:55.875 --> 38:57.333
"Oh, why ever not, Mr. Sloss?"

38:57.417 --> 38:59.834
Because it's fucking
homophobic, Nigel.

38:59.917 --> 39:01.208
(laughter)

39:01.291 --> 39:03.500
"But, Mr. Sloss,
you are homophobic."

39:03.583 --> 39:06.750
(laughter)

39:07.667 --> 39:10.000
-I beg your pardon, Nigel.
-(laughter)

39:10.083 --> 39:12.917
I am absolutely not homophobic.

39:13.542 --> 39:16.917
"Mr. Sloss, 28 years of people
using the word gay as an insult

39:17.000 --> 39:20.250
has done some pretty
lasting damage up here."

39:22.125 --> 39:24.083
-Huh!
-(laughter)

39:24.166 --> 39:26.875
Real-- Real-- Oh! I just--
I just-- I-- No, come on!

39:26.959 --> 39:30.041
Surely, we must have got rid of
all the homophobia back in 2007.

39:30.125 --> 39:31.625
Surely, there must've been
a clear out.

39:31.709 --> 39:33.667
Remember?
Seventeenth birthday,
we were in St. Andrews.

39:33.750 --> 39:36.542
We got really, really drunk,
then we went outside and
we shared a joint with that guy.

39:36.625 --> 39:38.375
He leaned in,
then you leaned in,

39:38.458 --> 39:39.792
and we kissed
for at least a minute.

39:39.875 --> 39:41.375
And I thought in that moment,
we realized

39:41.458 --> 39:43.375
that maybe sexuality
was more of a spectrum

39:43.458 --> 39:44.959
as opposed to a binary thing.

39:45.041 --> 39:47.542
"Oh, no, Mr. Sloss,
that's over there in issues."

39:47.625 --> 39:48.875
Oh, cool, leave it there.

39:48.959 --> 39:52.792
(laughter and applause)

39:55.792 --> 39:58.709
Anyway, Nigel, I'm not
really comfortable having
a homophobic opinion anymore.

39:58.792 --> 40:00.375
So, if you can just
throw this one out,

40:00.458 --> 40:02.417
and I'll give you my new
non-homophobic opinion,

40:02.500 --> 40:04.208
and I can move on with my life.

40:04.291 --> 40:06.792
"Eh, that's not really
how this works, Mr. Sloss.

40:06.875 --> 40:09.375
"You see, you developed this
opinion before you were 18.

40:09.458 --> 40:11.583
"When we're young,
our brains are very
malleable, responsive,

40:11.667 --> 40:13.750
"we're very open and receptive
to new bits of information

40:13.834 --> 40:15.208
"'cause we're essentially
blank slates.

40:15.291 --> 40:16.750
"So, nothing's really
right or wrong for us.

40:16.834 --> 40:18.625
"But when we become adults
and we're finishing puberty,

40:18.709 --> 40:20.667
"our brains solidify in a way.

40:20.750 --> 40:23.166
"Things that were
originally just opinions
cement themselves as fact

40:23.250 --> 40:24.583
"because we've believed
them for longer

40:24.667 --> 40:26.125
"and we think that gives
them more credibility.

40:26.208 --> 40:27.875
"That's why the older we get,
the more stubborn we are

40:27.959 --> 40:29.583
to new ideas
and new ways of life."

40:29.667 --> 40:31.750
And I'm like, that is
absolutely riveting, Nigel.

40:31.834 --> 40:34.041
-Change the fucking opinion.
-(laughter)

40:34.125 --> 40:36.083
Nigel, I can't have
a homophobic opinion.

40:36.166 --> 40:40.000
It's 2019, and I'm not
even trying to virtue signal
at this point anymore, Nigel,

40:40.083 --> 40:42.375
but in the past five years,
I've actually been

40:42.458 --> 40:45.542
to more gay weddings than
I've been to straight weddings.

40:46.333 --> 40:49.250
"But... but, Mr. Sloss,
all weddings are gay."

40:49.333 --> 40:52.834
-Fuck, that's not
still in there is it?
-(laughter)

41:00.291 --> 41:02.208
You have to be able
to change your old opinions.

41:02.291 --> 41:05.000
It's hard, but you have
to be able to do it.

41:05.875 --> 41:06.959
I struggle with it sometimes.

41:07.041 --> 41:08.750
I'm a fucking
stubborn motherfucker.

41:08.834 --> 41:10.709
I'm trying to get better at it.
The way I'm getting better

41:10.792 --> 41:13.250
is I'm just trying to talk
to people who I disagree with.

41:13.333 --> 41:15.875
Like, 'cause either
they strengthen my argument

41:15.959 --> 41:18.250
or they change my mind,
and neither of those
things are bad.

41:18.333 --> 41:21.125
It's just--
somebody can say something
from a different perspective,

41:21.208 --> 41:23.792
and you go, oh, fuck,
okay, I hadn't taken
that into consideration.

41:23.875 --> 41:26.041
-You're still wrong, but thanks.
-(laughter)

41:26.125 --> 41:28.583
But then there's other times
people will do something--
and not even say anything--

41:28.667 --> 41:31.166
but just through
a simple action,
they'll change your opinion.

41:31.250 --> 41:33.417
You'll just go, holy fuck,
okay, I was wrong.

41:33.500 --> 41:36.625
For example,
a couple of months ago,
I was having sex with a girl

41:36.709 --> 41:38.250
and she shoved
her finger up my ass,

41:38.333 --> 41:40.625
-and...
-(laughter)

41:40.709 --> 41:42.458
...it was a lot like
being in the Matrix,

41:42.542 --> 41:45.333
because I learned karate
in two seconds.

41:45.417 --> 41:47.500
(laughter)

41:47.583 --> 41:49.750
She just shoved it up there,
and I was like,

41:49.834 --> 41:54.125
No, no, never! Hi-yah!
Be gone! Never! Ooh, ah!

41:54.208 --> 41:57.375
Ooh, ooh, ooh.
Ooh... ah!

41:57.458 --> 42:00.834
Oh! Ha-ha-ha! Ho, ho!

42:00.917 --> 42:03.333
Namaste.

42:03.417 --> 42:06.625
(laughter and applause)

42:07.917 --> 42:10.417
And that lack of applause
you hear is coming from men

42:10.500 --> 42:13.083
who've never taken
a digit up the shitter.

42:13.750 --> 42:16.500
And to the men who've never
taken a finger up the tailpipe,

42:16.583 --> 42:18.333
all I have to tell you is,

42:18.417 --> 42:20.583
it's your own time
you're wasting.

42:20.667 --> 42:21.959
(laughter)

42:22.041 --> 42:25.291
You are punishing no one
apart from yourself.

42:25.375 --> 42:27.709
And you can sit there
being a fucking "man" about it,

42:27.792 --> 42:29.625
be like, "Oh, no.
No, it's not for me."

42:29.709 --> 42:32.375
-Scientifically, it is.
-(laughter)

42:32.458 --> 42:35.458
Scientifically, it's right up
your alley, no pun intended.

42:35.542 --> 42:38.208
-(laughter)
-That's where your clit is.

42:38.291 --> 42:41.458
-It's a shit clit,
but it's a clit nonetheless.
-(laughter)

42:41.542 --> 42:43.375
Just a little button
halfway up there

42:43.458 --> 42:45.000
that makes everything
taste like ice cream,

42:45.083 --> 42:47.250
except the finger obviously.

42:47.333 --> 42:49.750
(laughter)

42:49.834 --> 42:53.041
To the men in the room
that are too scared
to take a finger up the ass--

42:53.125 --> 42:56.375
and I will not change
my choice of words there--

42:56.458 --> 43:00.041
-to the men in the room that are
too (in baby talk): scared...

43:00.125 --> 43:02.709
-too scared to...
(blubbering)
-(laughter)

43:02.792 --> 43:04.667
...too scared to take
a little finger up the ass,

43:04.750 --> 43:07.417
I can tell you exactly why
you're too scared to take
a finger up your ass.

43:07.500 --> 43:10.375
It is because deep down,
this is what your insecurity is.

43:10.458 --> 43:14.750
Deep down you don't think
it's a button up there.

43:14.834 --> 43:17.083
You think it's a switch.

43:17.166 --> 43:20.250
(laughter)

43:20.333 --> 43:25.041
-That's it.
-(laughter and applause)

43:25.125 --> 43:29.834
That is all your pathetic
little insecurity is.

43:29.917 --> 43:32.000
You reckon she's going to shove
her finger up your ass

43:32.083 --> 43:33.750
and you're going to start
singing Elton John.

43:33.834 --> 43:36.834
-And that is...
-(laughter)

43:38.000 --> 43:40.959
so homophobic even Nigel's
like, "Jesus Christ."

43:41.041 --> 43:43.125
(laughter)

43:47.041 --> 43:48.500
So, I don't necessarily
like, you know,

43:48.583 --> 43:50.834
the narrative that we pitch
about pensioners nowadays.

43:50.917 --> 43:52.917
You know,
all old people are racists,
all old people are bigots.

43:53.000 --> 43:55.625
Like, yeah, sure,
half of them are,
but they'll all be dead soon.

43:55.709 --> 43:57.208
(laughter)

43:57.291 --> 43:59.500
Just a little bit,
of course, they've got
out-of-date opinions,

43:59.583 --> 44:01.125
they're fucking ancient.

44:01.208 --> 44:02.959
Like, I think you should
be nice to old people,

44:03.041 --> 44:05.166
treat them with respect,
make them cups of tea,

44:05.250 --> 44:06.709
and then when they
tell you their opinions,

44:06.792 --> 44:10.166
just go "Uh-huh," and then
never mention them again.

44:10.250 --> 44:12.250
Let them die with them.

44:12.333 --> 44:14.625
Old people will have opinions
that are just so out of date

44:14.709 --> 44:16.417
that they'll just say them
and you're like,

44:16.500 --> 44:18.792
fucking when was that valid?

44:18.875 --> 44:20.458
(laughter)

44:20.542 --> 44:23.667
They'll just say things
that aren't even hateful,
they're just, "Blah.

44:23.750 --> 44:26.667
"Back in my day we didn't
have depression or anxiety.

44:26.750 --> 44:30.667
We just called it being sad,
and we got on with our days."

44:31.250 --> 44:33.542
All right, cool,
that's a medical misdiagnosis.

44:33.625 --> 44:36.000
-(laughter)
-That's the equivalent
of saying,

44:36.083 --> 44:38.166
"Back in my day we didn't
have breast cancer.

44:38.250 --> 44:41.542
We just called it itchy tits
and we died at 37."

44:41.625 --> 44:43.375
-Like...
-(laughter)

44:43.458 --> 44:45.667
Yeah, well, now we have
medicine and names for things

44:45.750 --> 44:47.500
and the world is largely better.

44:47.583 --> 44:49.625
(laughter)

44:51.083 --> 44:54.291
Oh, and by the way,
if you hate my generation
as much as you claim to,

44:54.375 --> 44:57.083
how about you stop using
our doctors and medicine?

44:57.166 --> 44:59.125
(audience groans, laughs)

44:59.208 --> 45:01.417
See you in the ground, cunt.

45:01.500 --> 45:05.542
(laughter and applause)

45:05.625 --> 45:08.125
But... I want you to understand,

45:08.208 --> 45:11.000
when I bring up
these shitty opinions
that I once held,

45:11.083 --> 45:13.208
I don't bring them up to let
them see the light of day again,

45:13.291 --> 45:16.583
to reinvigorate them,
or to give them any more
credibility than they're due.

45:16.667 --> 45:19.083
I bring them up to show you that
I used to be a piece of shit.

45:19.166 --> 45:21.417
I mean, I still am one,
but I'm getting better.

45:21.500 --> 45:23.458
And that's allowed.
Like, I have opinions now

45:23.542 --> 45:26.375
that I would have disagreed
with five years ago,
and that's allowed.

45:26.458 --> 45:29.583
I have opinions now
that I might disagree
with in five years' time,

45:29.667 --> 45:31.208
and that's allowed.

45:31.291 --> 45:32.875
Just because you've
become an adult

45:32.959 --> 45:34.709
doesn't mean you stop
growing and learning.

45:34.792 --> 45:38.250
And if you do,
you fucking suck.

45:38.333 --> 45:39.834
We live in a society now

45:39.917 --> 45:41.709
where people are
being held accountable

45:41.792 --> 45:43.709
to things they said
ten years ago,

45:43.792 --> 45:47.709
as if that's who any of us
fucking are anymore,
and I find that ludicrous.

45:47.792 --> 45:50.542
Understand, I don't think
you should carte blanche
fucking get freedom,

45:50.625 --> 45:54.417
but just understand,
whenever I catch myself thinking

45:54.500 --> 45:57.333
something sexist or homophobic
or even sometimes racist,

45:57.417 --> 46:00.458
I am ashamed,
I'm embarrassed by it,
I truly, truly am to my core.

46:00.542 --> 46:03.750
Because that's not who I am,
that's not who I want to be.

46:03.834 --> 46:05.542
The solace I take from it is,

46:05.625 --> 46:07.000
I realize that none
of my shitty opinions,

46:07.083 --> 46:08.417
they've never come
from a place of hatred.

46:08.500 --> 46:10.291
They've only ever come
from a place of ignorance,

46:10.375 --> 46:12.750
which isn't much better,
but it is better.

46:13.291 --> 46:14.583
Hate and ignorance
go hand-in-hand,

46:14.667 --> 46:16.375
but ignorance is
more easy to cure.

46:16.458 --> 46:19.000
And everyone is
fucking ignorant. I don't
give a fuck who you are.

46:19.083 --> 46:21.583
You've lived one life,
7.5 billion are available.

46:21.667 --> 46:23.417
You don't know shit
about everyone else.

46:23.500 --> 46:24.875
Like, not something
to be proud of.

46:24.959 --> 46:27.250
Even now, like, women,
I've known you for 28 years

46:27.333 --> 46:30.583
and I've still got fucking
no idea about half your issues.

46:30.667 --> 46:32.959
I'm trying to get better,
I'm trying to learn,
but it's a slow fucking process.

46:33.041 --> 46:35.792
-I'm going to talk to you.
What's your name?
-Man: Nick.

46:35.875 --> 46:37.250
Daniel: Nick. Nick, can
I ask you a question?

46:37.333 --> 46:38.959
If you don't know the answer
to the question, Nick,

46:39.041 --> 46:41.041
that's fine,
that's the point of the routine.

46:41.125 --> 46:43.542
I also don't know the answer,
we can be idiots together.

46:43.625 --> 46:45.291
If you do know
the answer to the question,

46:45.375 --> 46:46.709
I'll look like a fucking moron.

46:46.792 --> 46:49.083
It's win-win for you.
Are you happy to participate?

46:49.166 --> 46:50.625
-(laughter)
-Cool.

46:50.709 --> 46:52.959
Nick, how do tampons work?

46:53.041 --> 46:56.583
(laughter and applause)

46:56.667 --> 46:58.625
Not a fucking clue?
I admire your honesty.

46:58.709 --> 47:00.500
And your girlfriend's like,
"What, why would he know?"

47:00.583 --> 47:02.542
Okay, I'm with you,
I'm with you.

47:02.625 --> 47:06.375
Um, I'm saying I know how one
form of sanitary product works,
and that is the Moon Cup.

47:06.458 --> 47:08.500
Now, do you know about
the Moon Cup, Nick?

47:08.583 --> 47:10.125
Little bit? That's cool.
I'll explain.

47:10.208 --> 47:12.625
-Strap in, uh...
-(laughter)

47:12.709 --> 47:15.625
Those of you that don't know,
men, uh, the Moon Cup is,

47:15.709 --> 47:17.625
it's a small silicon
menstrual cup

47:17.709 --> 47:19.667
and it's a reusable form
of sanitary product.

47:19.750 --> 47:22.667
And the reason it exists
is because women don't
get free tampons.

47:22.750 --> 47:28.000
Because as we all know
tampons are rightfully
classified as luxury items.

47:28.083 --> 47:30.500
Uh, sitting on your
thrones of joy!

47:30.583 --> 47:31.834
(laughter)

47:31.917 --> 47:36.166
Oh, as a man, I dream
but to one day afford a tampon.

47:36.250 --> 47:39.834
-(laughter)
-Ah, how the other half live!

47:39.917 --> 47:42.208
Women, you truly do get it all.

47:42.291 --> 47:43.834
(laughter)

47:43.917 --> 47:47.041
So, women of lower income
families and homeless women

47:47.125 --> 47:49.625
wouldn't get free tampons
and they'd have to use
rags or nothing.

47:49.709 --> 47:51.875
And they'd get infections and
there's a high mortality rate.

47:51.959 --> 47:53.667
Then an amazing woman
called Leona Chalmers

47:53.750 --> 47:55.000
invented this small
reusable cup.

47:55.083 --> 47:56.834
And the only reason
I know anything about this

47:56.917 --> 47:58.750
is because one of my friends
walked in one day,

47:58.834 --> 48:00.792
she was like,
"I use the Moon Cup now."

48:00.875 --> 48:01.959
And I was like, "Ew!"

48:02.041 --> 48:04.125
And then she hit me,
and that's fair.

48:04.208 --> 48:06.000
(laughter)

48:06.083 --> 48:08.959
And afterwards, I was like,
okay, can I ask you a bunch
of questions about it?

48:09.041 --> 48:11.959
She's like, "Of course you can.
That's the only way
you'll stop being ignorant.

48:12.041 --> 48:13.291
What would you like to know?"

48:13.375 --> 48:15.625
And I was like,
how do you...?

48:15.709 --> 48:17.083
(laughter)

48:17.166 --> 48:19.208
How do you actually--
How do you get it up-- I just--

48:19.291 --> 48:20.542
How do you get it up there?
I just don't--

48:20.625 --> 48:22.583
How do you get an open end
up an open end?

48:22.667 --> 48:25.208
-Like, I just...
-(laughter)

48:25.291 --> 48:27.583
Like, that's not how
you stack cups.

48:27.667 --> 48:30.125
-(laughter)
-Like...

48:31.375 --> 48:33.917
Like, that's how you make
horse noises in Monty Python.

48:34.000 --> 48:36.667
-Like, that's not...
-(laughter and applause)

48:36.750 --> 48:39.041
-I don't...
-(laughter continuing)

48:39.750 --> 48:41.333
And she was like,
"It's very simple, Dan.

48:41.417 --> 48:43.750
You go Italian
and then you appreciate."

48:43.834 --> 48:47.417
-(laughter)
-I was like, ah-ha-ha. Okay.

48:47.500 --> 48:48.875
Then apparently to get it out,

48:48.959 --> 48:51.542
all you have to do
is just go... (blows)

48:51.625 --> 48:54.583
-And then...
-(laughter)

48:54.667 --> 48:56.291
And if you do that
over a canvas,

48:56.375 --> 49:00.083
-a vegan will buy it.
-(laughter)

49:00.166 --> 49:05.125
(laughter and applause)

49:12.291 --> 49:14.834
You do one 15-minute
vegan-hating routine,

49:14.917 --> 49:16.667
and suddenly you're
the vegan hater.

49:16.750 --> 49:18.667
(laughter)

49:19.834 --> 49:22.000
But it's when we get
to the other forms

49:22.083 --> 49:23.583
of sanitary products
when I'm with Nick,

49:23.667 --> 49:26.375
I just-- I don't know--
I know which types you've got,

49:26.458 --> 49:28.417
I know what they look like,
don't know what they do.

49:28.500 --> 49:31.375
I know you've got the, uh...
You've got the little
fucking free-range bullets.

49:31.458 --> 49:33.000
I know those ones just, uh...

49:33.083 --> 49:35.208
the wee sad ones
at the bottom of
your handbags.

49:35.291 --> 49:36.625
Those are the ones that leave--

49:36.709 --> 49:39.125
There's a-snake-
in-my-boot string.
I know that.

49:39.208 --> 49:40.625
(laughter)

49:40.709 --> 49:42.875
Uh, and then
you've got the fucking--

49:42.959 --> 49:47.417
the weird fucking
Apollo 13 syringe thing.

49:47.500 --> 49:50.291
Like, it expands--
It's like the memory thing
from Men in Black.

49:50.375 --> 49:52.875
-Like, pew. I don't--
-(laughter)

49:53.750 --> 49:55.667
I've got theories
on how that works.

49:55.750 --> 49:57.875
-(laughter)
-I think it's like a--

49:57.959 --> 49:59.959
I think it's like
a push in and scoosh.

50:00.041 --> 50:01.875
(laughter)

50:02.291 --> 50:05.041
But even if that is the case,
I still got more questions.

50:05.125 --> 50:06.542
(laughter)

50:06.625 --> 50:09.166
-Like, does it feel good?
-(laughter)

50:09.250 --> 50:11.709
And women are disgusted by
the concept of that question.

50:11.792 --> 50:14.583
Every time I'm like,
they're like,"No, no.
Why would it feel good?"

50:14.667 --> 50:17.583
Fine. Jesus. Okay.
Here's why me, a man,

50:17.667 --> 50:19.500
would assume that it
might feel good

50:19.583 --> 50:21.500
to shove something
up your pussy.

50:21.583 --> 50:23.166
-Because...
-(laughter)

50:23.250 --> 50:25.166
you obviously don't know
what it's like to have a dick.

50:25.250 --> 50:26.542
And dicks are morons.

50:26.625 --> 50:28.333
Every morning
I pull on my boxers,

50:28.417 --> 50:31.000
and occasionally my boxers
will brush the tip of my dick,

50:31.083 --> 50:34.291
and my dick will be like,
"It's a pussy!" and I'm like...

50:34.375 --> 50:37.750
(laughter and applause)

50:39.667 --> 50:41.875
(mouthing)

50:42.917 --> 50:45.709
Where do you see a pussy?

50:45.792 --> 50:48.917
(laughter)

50:50.041 --> 50:53.375
-"I thought I felt one."
-(laughter)

50:53.458 --> 50:56.625
Mm-hmm. And where is it now?

50:57.917 --> 51:00.959
-(grunts "I don't know")
-(laughter)

51:01.041 --> 51:02.542
"You must have scared it off."

51:02.625 --> 51:04.834
-Oh, ho-ho-ho.
-(laughter)

51:04.917 --> 51:06.750
I'm gonna beat you to death.

51:06.834 --> 51:09.458
(laughter and applause)

51:10.625 --> 51:12.792
(cheers, whistles)

51:16.417 --> 51:17.625
So...

51:18.542 --> 51:20.375
So, I was like learn--
just learn how the tampons work.

51:20.458 --> 51:21.750
So I was talking
to my friend Jean,

51:21.834 --> 51:23.417
'cause I'm not going
to google that

51:23.500 --> 51:25.709
'cause I don't want to be
on a fucking list.

51:25.792 --> 51:27.792
And I was like, Jean,
how do tampons work?

51:27.875 --> 51:31.583
-And she was like, "Please tell
me how you think tampons work."
-(laughter)

51:31.667 --> 51:34.417
And then seven days later
when she had stopped laughing...

51:34.500 --> 51:35.750
(laughter)

51:35.834 --> 51:37.792
She was like,
"You're a fucking moron."

51:37.875 --> 51:39.583
And I was like, well,
I'm not a total moron.

51:39.667 --> 51:41.583
Like, I know how the pads work.

51:41.667 --> 51:43.583
Turns out I don't know
how the pads work.

51:43.667 --> 51:45.291
(laughter)

51:45.375 --> 51:47.125
What's your name there?

51:48.500 --> 51:49.792
Alex. Lovely to meet you, Alex.

51:49.875 --> 51:51.083
Very simple question
for you, Alex.

51:51.166 --> 51:52.917
Uh, you know
the sticky bits on pads?

51:53.000 --> 51:55.333
What do the sticky bits
stick onto?

51:55.417 --> 51:57.667
On to your underwear, correct.
Not what I thought.

51:57.750 --> 52:00.500
(laughter)

52:01.917 --> 52:04.000
(laughter)

52:05.000 --> 52:08.125
-I am 28 years old...
-(laughter)

52:08.208 --> 52:11.792
...and up until
January this year,

52:11.875 --> 52:15.083
I had always believed that
whenever you got your period,

52:15.166 --> 52:17.166
that you just...

52:17.250 --> 52:20.875
(laughter and applause)

52:22.542 --> 52:25.625
-...closed up shop.
-(laughter)

52:25.709 --> 52:29.625
-Like a Texas farm
during a hurricane.
-(laughter)

52:29.709 --> 52:32.000
"Storm's a coming!"

52:32.083 --> 52:34.208
(laughter)

52:35.583 --> 52:38.667
"Oh, it's going to be
the largest one since 1979."

52:38.750 --> 52:41.709
(laughter)

52:43.667 --> 52:46.125
Honestly, I just-- I honestly
thought you were just like,

52:46.208 --> 52:48.375
"I'm bleeding,
this is a plaster,

52:48.458 --> 52:50.375
-I'll deal with that..."
-(laughter)

52:50.458 --> 52:52.417
"...on Thursday.

52:53.208 --> 52:56.041
-Pick the scabs on Monday."
-(audience laughs, groans)

52:56.125 --> 52:58.542
Aw, write a fucking
blog about it.

52:58.625 --> 53:00.917
(laughter)

53:05.500 --> 53:08.041
Now, I will point out,
it's not my fault
I don't know that.

53:08.125 --> 53:09.959
I was never taught
how tampons work.

53:10.041 --> 53:11.875
Not only was I never
taught how tampons work,

53:11.959 --> 53:15.125
I was actively excluded
from the moment that young
women learn about them.

53:15.208 --> 53:17.000
Now, when we get
sex education in Scotland,

53:17.083 --> 53:19.041
we get it from about
the age of ten years old.

53:19.125 --> 53:21.291
And they do teach
about periods and stuff,

53:21.375 --> 53:23.041
but when they teach
the girls about tampons,

53:23.125 --> 53:24.834
they take the girls through
to another room with a nurse,

53:24.917 --> 53:27.959
so she can explain
how the tampons work.
And I get that.

53:28.041 --> 53:29.500
You don't want
the ten-year-old
boys in that room,

53:29.583 --> 53:32.166
-because they're fucked
little creatures.
-(laughter)

53:32.250 --> 53:34.709
But I think that while
they're in that room
being taught tampons,

53:34.792 --> 53:37.041
just also teach us
the same lesson

53:37.125 --> 53:39.875
-instead of fucking maths.
-(laughter)

53:39.959 --> 53:41.959
Because like I want--
I do-- I should know.

53:42.041 --> 53:43.583
We should all know
how tampons work.

53:43.667 --> 53:44.875
'Cause I'm going to be
a father one day,

53:44.959 --> 53:46.291
and I'm going
to have daughters.

53:46.375 --> 53:47.709
My daughters are going
to get periods.

53:47.792 --> 53:49.500
I don't know when,
they don't know when.

53:49.583 --> 53:52.834
-That's the fun thing
about periods.
-(laughter)

53:52.917 --> 53:55.834
But their mother might not be
around for their first period.

53:55.917 --> 53:57.500
She might be at work,
she might be dead.

53:57.583 --> 53:59.208
Who knows what
the future holds?

53:59.291 --> 54:01.291
Hey, itchy tits is very common.

54:01.375 --> 54:03.792
(laughter)

54:04.667 --> 54:07.125
I want to be able to explain
to my daughters

54:07.208 --> 54:08.625
how to use tampons, man.

54:08.709 --> 54:10.041
I don't want to be
crouched in a bathroom

54:10.125 --> 54:11.792
with a 12-year-old,
holding a tampon going,

54:11.875 --> 54:14.000
I don't know.
Take a run up?

54:14.083 --> 54:16.333
(laughter)

54:19.875 --> 54:21.750
And I'm not criticizing
sex education.

54:21.834 --> 54:25.250
I think sex education is one
of the most important things
in the entire world.

54:25.333 --> 54:28.625
Sex doesn't need
to be terrifying
the first time we have it.

54:28.709 --> 54:31.583
I believe the reason
most of us are terrified
the first time we have sex

54:31.667 --> 54:33.375
is 'cause we know
so little about it.

54:33.458 --> 54:34.834
'Cause even when you are
given sex education

54:34.917 --> 54:36.583
in countries like Scotland
and over here,

54:36.667 --> 54:39.959
they'll teach you some bits,
but not everything you need
to know.

54:40.041 --> 54:42.583
Like it's-- it can be
terrifying and stuff.

54:42.667 --> 54:45.208
Like, 'cause even with all
the sex education I was given,

54:45.291 --> 54:46.959
I was still fucking
freaked out, man.

54:47.041 --> 54:49.583
The first time I fingered
a girl terrified me.

54:49.667 --> 54:51.417
I was 16 years old, right?

54:51.500 --> 54:53.291
And the reason it scared me
is just because, like,

54:53.375 --> 54:58.959
the vagina is just
way, way, way, lower...

54:59.041 --> 55:00.625
(laughter)

55:00.709 --> 55:03.083
-than I had anticipated
because...
-(laughter)

55:03.166 --> 55:05.250
'Cause it's, it's fucking--
it's right under there.

55:05.333 --> 55:08.667
-(laughter)
-Like it's-- 'cause my dick's
on the front.

55:08.750 --> 55:10.291
(laughter)

55:10.375 --> 55:11.959
That's where my dick is.

55:12.041 --> 55:13.291
So, that's where
I thought the pussy was.

55:13.375 --> 55:15.750
I didn't know you'd
hidden the thing.

55:15.834 --> 55:18.166
So, cue the most confusing
seven seconds of my life,

55:18.250 --> 55:20.000
where I'm like, here we go,
about to become a man,

55:20.083 --> 55:21.291
can't wait to tell
the boys about this.

55:21.375 --> 55:23.709
-Where the fuck is this thing?
-(laughter)

55:23.792 --> 55:26.000
Are you a Barbie?
What is this?!

55:26.083 --> 55:27.500
(laughter)

55:28.000 --> 55:29.792
Must have been worse for her,
just lying there like,

55:29.875 --> 55:32.625
"Is this cunt trying
to make me piss myself?"

55:32.709 --> 55:34.834
(laughter)

55:36.041 --> 55:38.000
Even some of the subjects
they teach in sex education--

55:38.083 --> 55:40.333
They will teach you things
in sex education

55:40.417 --> 55:42.166
that has nothing
to do with sex.

55:42.250 --> 55:45.917
They will teach you things
that only doctors need to know.

55:46.000 --> 55:48.333
"All right, boys and girls,
pay attention to this diagram,

55:48.417 --> 55:51.542
"'cause this diagram
is crucial to having sex.

55:51.625 --> 55:54.083
"This is the labia...

55:54.166 --> 55:56.166
"This is the vulva...

55:56.250 --> 55:58.166
Uh, this is the vuvuzela."

55:58.250 --> 56:01.041
(laughter)

56:01.125 --> 56:04.250
"These are the fallopian tubes."
And you're like, cool!

56:04.333 --> 56:07.250
What do you want me to do
with that information?

56:07.333 --> 56:08.709
(laughter)

56:08.792 --> 56:10.083
"These are the ovaries."

56:10.166 --> 56:13.291
Listen, if I ever see
the ovaries, I've fucked up.

56:13.375 --> 56:16.500
-(laughter and applause)
-Like...

56:17.291 --> 56:21.166
-I fucked up
quite substantially.
-(laughter)

56:21.250 --> 56:22.709
If I ever see the ovaries,

56:22.792 --> 56:26.166
I can assure you,
I'm not going to be like,
well, those...

56:26.250 --> 56:28.417
-(laughter)
-...are your ovaries.

56:28.500 --> 56:30.083
(laughter)

56:30.166 --> 56:33.250
I'm gonna be like... (shrieks)

56:33.333 --> 56:36.291
-What have I done?
-(laughter)

56:37.458 --> 56:40.125
Where's the clit?
I'm gonna google it anyway!

56:40.208 --> 56:42.458
(laughter)

56:45.834 --> 56:48.625
But they don't want to teach
teenagers about the clitoris,

56:48.709 --> 56:50.542
and if they do, ironically,
they brush over it,

56:50.625 --> 56:53.917
-because...
-(laughter)

56:55.208 --> 56:58.792
I think they don't want
teenagers to learn
that sex is fun,

56:58.875 --> 57:00.417
'cause the fear is
that if teenagers learn

57:00.500 --> 57:01.875
that sex is fun,
they'll have it more.

57:01.959 --> 57:03.834
Now, as with all fears,
it's fucking horseshit.

57:03.917 --> 57:07.041
When you don't teach
teenagers enough about sex,
they become curious.

57:07.125 --> 57:08.792
We're naturally
inquisitive creatures,

57:08.875 --> 57:10.250
and they are filled
with hormones.

57:10.333 --> 57:11.458
So what you're actually doing

57:11.542 --> 57:13.041
is you're giving them
limited knowledge

57:13.125 --> 57:15.750
on something that they are
inevitably going to experience,

57:15.834 --> 57:18.083
and that is incredibly
fucking dangerous.

57:18.166 --> 57:21.709
Stop teaching children
that sex is for reproduction,

57:21.792 --> 57:24.792
because we all know that
it fucking isn't, right?

57:24.875 --> 57:28.917
Reproduction is
one percent of what
sex is actually used for,

57:29.000 --> 57:31.834
and I am rounding up
heavily there.

57:31.917 --> 57:33.542
(laughter)

57:33.625 --> 57:35.083
Most of us have had sex.

57:35.166 --> 57:37.083
Some of you will have
had sex to have children.

57:37.166 --> 57:38.917
Those of you that have
had sex to have children,

57:39.000 --> 57:40.333
I hope will be willing to admit

57:40.417 --> 57:41.917
that most of the time
you've ever fucked

57:42.041 --> 57:45.625
-was explicitly to
not have children!
-(laughter)

57:45.709 --> 57:47.625
Teaching kids that sex
is for reproduction

57:47.709 --> 57:49.792
is like teaching them
that food is for sustenance.

57:49.875 --> 57:52.458
Like, yeah, at a base level
millions of years ago

57:52.542 --> 57:54.000
when survival was
our only purpose,

57:54.083 --> 57:55.542
of course that's
all it was there for.

57:55.625 --> 57:57.625
But it's grown and evolved
and changed with us.

57:57.709 --> 57:59.792
And we've changed the way
we speak to kids about food,

57:59.875 --> 58:02.125
so why aren't we changing
the way we speak
to them about sex?

58:02.208 --> 58:03.625
When you teach
your kids how to cook,

58:03.709 --> 58:05.291
you just don't teach them
how to make oatmeal

58:05.375 --> 58:07.959
-and only fucking oatmeal.
-(laughter)

58:08.041 --> 58:10.000
"All right kids, gather round,
this is the one and only

58:10.083 --> 58:12.458
"recipe you'll need for
the rest of your lives.

58:12.542 --> 58:15.625
And even then only
when you're starving!"

58:15.709 --> 58:17.291
(laughter)

58:17.375 --> 58:19.875
"Don't google any others,
you filthy little pervert.

58:19.959 --> 58:21.792
-"So...
-(laughter)

58:21.875 --> 58:24.041
"What you do is you get the oats
and you get the water."

58:24.125 --> 58:26.834
"My mom makes chicken wings."
"Your mother's a whore, Jason."

58:26.917 --> 58:30.458
(laughter and applause)

58:35.250 --> 58:36.750
Sex isn't for reproduction.

58:36.834 --> 58:39.834
Sex is for love, lust, revenge.

58:39.917 --> 58:42.000
(laughter)

58:42.083 --> 58:43.667
Boredom, lost a bet, won a bet,

58:43.750 --> 58:46.583
order a Dominos, see if you can
beat it to the front door.

58:46.667 --> 58:48.250
(laughter)

58:48.333 --> 58:50.333
Also, I'm not suggesting you
teach the science side of sex.

58:50.417 --> 58:53.250
The science side of sex
is absolutely fucked, right?

58:53.333 --> 58:55.500
The science side of sex is--
Here's what I was told
when I was young.

58:55.583 --> 58:58.667
Man gets an erection,
man shoves his erect penis
inside of a lady's vagina,

58:58.750 --> 59:00.125
at which point his penis
is stimulated enough

59:00.208 --> 59:02.667
that he ejaculates semen
up into her vuvuzela

59:02.750 --> 59:04.333
where a goblin then hoards it

59:04.417 --> 59:05.834
and turns it into
gingerbread men.

59:05.917 --> 59:07.417
-Who gives a shit?
-(laughter)

59:07.500 --> 59:10.208
Only a doctor and midwife
need to know about that.

59:10.291 --> 59:11.875
Because when I was 12 years old,

59:11.959 --> 59:15.458
all that manifested itself
in my brain as was,
women are vessels.

59:15.542 --> 59:17.250
Because what I was told was,
here's what sex is.

59:17.333 --> 59:19.375
Man gets an erection,
man shoves it in,

59:19.458 --> 59:22.041
man comes,
that's the definition of sex.

59:22.125 --> 59:25.208
By the sounds of things,
she's just lying there
the whole time like--

59:25.291 --> 59:26.959
(laughter)

59:27.041 --> 59:29.000
-"Thanks."
-(laughter)

59:29.083 --> 59:32.041
-"That was real nice of you
to do that for me."
-(laughter)

59:32.125 --> 59:35.542
"I'll just go turn this
into an Uber driver, shall I?"

59:35.625 --> 59:37.792
(laughter)

59:37.875 --> 59:40.291
I was never taught
that women enjoyed sex.

59:40.375 --> 59:42.375
So, the first couple
of times I had sex,

59:42.458 --> 59:44.208
I wasn't trying
to make it enjoyable

59:44.291 --> 59:45.667
for anyone other than myself.

59:45.750 --> 59:48.083
Thank God for
my first girlfriend!

59:48.166 --> 59:50.250
First time we fucked,
she was like, "I didn't come."

59:50.333 --> 59:52.750
And I was like,
"You fucking come?"

59:52.834 --> 59:55.333
(laughter)

59:55.417 --> 59:57.250
I was never taught
that women enjoyed sex.

59:57.333 --> 59:58.750
You never taught me
that a lot of the time

59:58.834 --> 01:00:00.250
women have a higher
libido than men.

01:00:00.333 --> 01:00:02.709
You never taught me that
some of them like to be choked.

01:00:02.792 --> 01:00:04.709
That was a weird day!

01:00:04.792 --> 01:00:07.500
(laughter and applause)

01:00:08.750 --> 01:00:10.750
I could have done
with that information

01:00:10.834 --> 01:00:13.083
a lot fucking sooner
than I got it!

01:00:13.166 --> 01:00:14.583
(laughter)

01:00:14.667 --> 01:00:18.083
You want me to what?
What? Do I like this?

01:00:18.166 --> 01:00:20.500
(laughter)

01:00:21.959 --> 01:00:25.959
And I'm not suggesting
we get teachers to teach
this type of sex education.

01:00:26.041 --> 01:00:29.000
We do not pay teachers enough
money to say the word orgasm

01:00:29.083 --> 01:00:31.333
50 times in front of
a bunch of 12-year-olds.

01:00:31.417 --> 01:00:32.709
(laughter)

01:00:32.792 --> 01:00:34.250
But just 'cause you can't
get teachers to do it,

01:00:34.333 --> 01:00:35.834
doesn't mean you can't get
somebody from the outside.

01:00:35.917 --> 01:00:37.917
Somebody that's going to be
fun and engaging with the kids.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.625
Somebody that they know
is there to talk to them
openly and honestly about sex.

01:00:40.709 --> 01:00:42.333
Someone they're not scared
to ask questions to.

01:00:42.417 --> 01:00:46.375
Someone that's
sort of fun, charismatic,
with stage presence.

01:00:46.458 --> 01:00:48.834
(laughter)

01:00:49.875 --> 01:00:51.291
(laughter)

01:00:51.375 --> 01:00:52.959
-I'll do it.
-(laughter)

01:00:53.041 --> 01:00:56.583
-I'll do it for free.
I'd fucking kill for that job.
-(laughter)

01:00:56.667 --> 01:00:58.333
Hi, boys and girls,
my name is Daniel Sloss,

01:00:58.417 --> 01:01:01.542
but the girls call me Daddy.
I'll get onto that in a second.

01:01:01.625 --> 01:01:04.041
(laughter and applause)

01:01:06.166 --> 01:01:09.458
All right, boys,
first things first,
the vagina way lower.

01:01:09.542 --> 01:01:14.000
Way... lower than it has
any right to be quite frankly.

01:01:14.083 --> 01:01:15.959
Just keep going,
and if you go too far,

01:01:16.041 --> 01:01:18.041
trust me,
she'll fucking tell you.

01:01:18.125 --> 01:01:20.208
(laughter)

01:01:20.291 --> 01:01:22.083
Second thing second,
some of them squirt.

01:01:22.166 --> 01:01:24.834
It might be piss, but none
of us care at this point.

01:01:24.917 --> 01:01:26.750
(laughter)

01:01:28.250 --> 01:01:30.667
And you then have to get
a female in to talk to the kids

01:01:30.750 --> 01:01:32.333
with a female
perspective on sex.

01:01:32.417 --> 01:01:34.458
She can go on before me,
after me, doesn't matter.

01:01:34.542 --> 01:01:36.750
She'll be, "Hi, boys and girls,
my name's Miss Jack.

01:01:36.834 --> 01:01:39.041
"I need to talk to you
about the woman's
experience during sex.

01:01:39.125 --> 01:01:41.792
"And to the young boys in
the classroom, this can be
quite nerve-wracking.

01:01:41.875 --> 01:01:44.333
"You're going through puberty,
your imaginations are
running wild,

01:01:44.417 --> 01:01:45.834
"you've got hormones
running around your body.

01:01:45.917 --> 01:01:47.709
"Probably sitting there
quite nervous going 'Oh, God,

01:01:47.792 --> 01:01:49.917
"this is going to be
so nerve-wracking.
What do I do, what do I do?'

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.083
"Well, let's get all
the curiosity out the way

01:01:52.166 --> 01:01:54.458
right up top,
because it's all natural."

01:01:55.166 --> 01:01:56.458
(laughter)

01:01:56.542 --> 01:01:58.792
"There you go, that's a vagina.

01:01:58.875 --> 01:02:01.291
-Look at it!"
-(laughter)

01:02:01.375 --> 01:02:03.375
"Now, boys pay attention,
this is a real pussy.

01:02:03.458 --> 01:02:04.917
"This ain't one of those
porno pussies.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:08.375
-This one's been to 'Nam, okay?"
-(laughter)

01:02:08.458 --> 01:02:11.166
"This is the labia,
this is the vulva,

01:02:11.250 --> 01:02:13.709
-this is the vuvuzela."
-(laughter)

01:02:13.792 --> 01:02:15.583
"This is the, um...

01:02:17.041 --> 01:02:19.458
-What the fuck is that?
-(laughter)

01:02:19.542 --> 01:02:22.208
-"Oh, that's a tampon string,
I apologize."
-(laughter)

01:02:22.291 --> 01:02:24.750
"Sorry. No, no, boys,
it's not disgusting actually.

01:02:24.834 --> 01:02:27.166
"In fact, it's
perfectly natural.
In fact, any volunteers?

01:02:27.250 --> 01:02:29.000
-"Any?
-(laughter)

01:02:29.083 --> 01:02:31.041
"No? Real men
do it with their teeth?

01:02:31.125 --> 01:02:33.583
(audience laughs, groans)

01:02:33.667 --> 01:02:35.333
"All right boys,
get your notepads out.

01:02:35.417 --> 01:02:37.417
"Just up here, look boys.
This is where the clitoris is.

01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:38.959
"It's actually surprisingly
easy to find.

01:02:39.041 --> 01:02:41.250
"But here's the insider tip:
just because you found it,

01:02:41.333 --> 01:02:43.250
doesn't mean you have
to beat it to death.

01:02:43.333 --> 01:02:46.917
-(laughter)
-"Be gentle! It's not
Osama Bin Laden.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.917
"Just because you found it,
doesn't mean it has to die.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.291
(laughter)

01:02:53.333 --> 01:02:55.083
By the way, if your girlfriend
laughed at that joke,

01:02:55.166 --> 01:02:57.625
you can't eat pussy for shit.

01:02:57.709 --> 01:03:00.333
(laughter and applause)

01:03:07.458 --> 01:03:09.917
I think sex education
needs to be improved,

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.500
and I think it needs to be made
compulsory around the world.

01:03:12.583 --> 01:03:16.125
If you want proof of why
sex education is needed
now more than ever,

01:03:16.208 --> 01:03:19.542
look at the current sexual
climate that we live in.

01:03:19.625 --> 01:03:23.208
Exactly.
Things aren't going very well.

01:03:23.291 --> 01:03:24.959
A lot of people don't
seem to know the rules.

01:03:25.041 --> 01:03:27.458
Or if they do know the rules,
they don't seem to care.

01:03:27.542 --> 01:03:31.291
It's very, very easy to not
sexually assault someone.

01:03:31.375 --> 01:03:33.041
Watch.

01:03:33.125 --> 01:03:35.500
(laughter)

01:03:35.583 --> 01:03:38.667
-Nailed it. Now...
-(laughter and applause)

01:03:42.291 --> 01:03:44.667
I'm very aware that my industry,
the entertainment industry,

01:03:44.750 --> 01:03:46.208
is a massive part
of the problem.

01:03:46.291 --> 01:03:47.667
It's where the MeToo
movement started.

01:03:47.750 --> 01:03:49.083
Now, although I don't have
direct experience in it,

01:03:49.166 --> 01:03:50.917
it doesn't mean
I haven't heard the stories,

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.834
and it doesn't mean
it hasn't affected people
that I know and love.

01:03:52.917 --> 01:03:55.959
My agent/manager,
who I've been with
11 years now,

01:03:56.041 --> 01:03:58.250
ten years ago
she was told by somebody

01:03:58.333 --> 01:04:00.667
very, very, very high up
from the BBC

01:04:00.750 --> 01:04:03.375
that if she wanted her TV show
for one of her clients,

01:04:03.458 --> 01:04:06.166
she had to suck his dick.
Right? Yeah.

01:04:06.250 --> 01:04:08.834
And she said no, which makes
me question her commitment.

01:04:08.917 --> 01:04:11.041
-But, um...
-(laughter)

01:04:11.125 --> 01:04:14.834
But-- but despite
her selfishness,

01:04:14.917 --> 01:04:18.583
-my career has flourished.
-(laughter)

01:04:18.667 --> 01:04:20.667
I'm assuming Netflix was anal.

01:04:20.750 --> 01:04:23.500
(laughter)

01:04:23.583 --> 01:04:27.250
-Mainly because
I gave Netflix anal.
-(laughter)

01:04:27.333 --> 01:04:29.083
Look, I've made horrible
jokes about it now,

01:04:29.166 --> 01:04:31.208
but she didn't tell me about
this when it happened.

01:04:31.291 --> 01:04:34.083
She told me about this
last year when I was
writing this show

01:04:34.166 --> 01:04:37.166
and she saw the content,
or some of it, and she told me.

01:04:37.250 --> 01:04:39.375
And I was like,
why didn't you tell me about
this when it happened?

01:04:39.458 --> 01:04:41.417
And she was like,
"Well, there's nothing
you could have done,

01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:42.917
"there's nothing
you would have done.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.125
And why would I tell you
about one in ten experiences?"

01:04:45.208 --> 01:04:47.208
And that was a moment
that really fucking hit me
in the chest.

01:04:47.291 --> 01:04:48.583
Well, oh, Jesus Christ, I...

01:04:48.667 --> 01:04:50.709
I didn't know
it was that common.

01:04:50.792 --> 01:04:52.917
Now, regardless of what your
stance on the MeToo movement is,

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.125
the conclusion everyone has
to have arrived at by now

01:04:55.208 --> 01:04:56.834
is that this shit
is horrifically common,

01:04:56.917 --> 01:04:58.208
'cause that's just
there in the stats.

01:04:58.291 --> 01:05:00.625
Like 50 women came forward
about Bill Cosby.

01:05:00.709 --> 01:05:02.917
Eighty women came forward
about Harvey Weinstein.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.208
Yet there are still some people
who will look at that and go,

01:05:05.291 --> 01:05:09.083
"Well, I guess we'll never
know what happened."

01:05:09.166 --> 01:05:12.041
(laughter)

01:05:12.125 --> 01:05:14.959
Fucking hell, I bet you were
shite at Blues Clues  .

01:05:15.041 --> 01:05:17.458
(laughter)

01:05:18.458 --> 01:05:20.875
Man, if 50 women accused me
of sexual assault,

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.667
-I'd think I'd done it.
-(laughter)

01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:25.917
It's too many to not be true.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.125
If 50 women are like,
"You sexually assaulted us,"

01:05:28.208 --> 01:05:31.000
-I'd be like, fuck, did I?
-(laughter)

01:05:31.083 --> 01:05:32.583
I must have!

01:05:32.667 --> 01:05:34.792
There's no other reason
why you would all say that.

01:05:34.875 --> 01:05:37.458
Unless you all had
a meeting in the bathroom--
I know what's up.

01:05:37.542 --> 01:05:39.417
-Like...
-(laughter)

01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:42.917
Certain men-- not all, not most,
but definitely some men--

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.250
felt attacked by
the MeToo movement,

01:05:45.333 --> 01:05:48.125
which is an incredibly
interesting stance to take.

01:05:48.208 --> 01:05:49.917
(laughter)

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.750
If you feel under attack
by the MeToo movement,
here's my question for you.

01:05:52.834 --> 01:05:55.208
-What have you done?
-(laughter)

01:05:55.291 --> 01:05:58.041
Like, what alarm bell is going
off in the back of your head?

01:05:58.125 --> 01:06:01.083
'Cause I think most men had
a similar reaction to the MeToo
movement that I did.

01:06:01.166 --> 01:06:03.166
Which is, you sat there
watching Facebook, Twitter,

01:06:03.250 --> 01:06:05.208
the news, wherever it is that
you get your information from

01:06:05.291 --> 01:06:07.083
and you're just sat there
being like, oh, fucking hell.

01:06:07.166 --> 01:06:09.542
Okay, I knew it was a problem,
but I didn't realize
it was this big.

01:06:09.625 --> 01:06:11.166
Oh, my God, okay,
this is everywhere.

01:06:11.250 --> 01:06:13.041
Oh, my God, I didn't realize it
affected that many women I know.

01:06:13.125 --> 01:06:15.125
Fucking hell, I feel
a bit closed-minded.
Jesus Christ, I didn't--

01:06:15.208 --> 01:06:16.959
And then very secretly
and very privately,

01:06:17.041 --> 01:06:19.250
we all went upstairs to visit
our very own Nigels

01:06:19.333 --> 01:06:21.917
-to run a quick background
check on ourselves.
-(laughter)

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.959
Zero shame in double-checking.
That's the first thing I did.

01:06:25.041 --> 01:06:27.959
I ran straight upstairs
and I was like, Nigel!

01:06:28.041 --> 01:06:29.208
And he was like, "Mr. Sloss!"

01:06:29.291 --> 01:06:31.458
I went, zero time
for that shit, Nigel.

01:06:31.542 --> 01:06:33.333
There's some very serious
stuff going on outside.

01:06:33.417 --> 01:06:36.458
I need you to run through
every single sexual encounter
I've ever had

01:06:36.542 --> 01:06:38.542
and make sure it was all
above board and consensual.

01:06:38.625 --> 01:06:40.959
And he was like, "You know,
that might take a while."
And then we high-fived.

01:06:41.041 --> 01:06:45.291
-And then...
-(laughter and applause)

01:06:46.583 --> 01:06:49.750
-And then seven days later...
-(laughter)

01:06:49.834 --> 01:06:51.542
He was like, "Mr. Sloss,
just double-checked.

01:06:51.625 --> 01:06:53.000
As we thought,
you're all in the clear."

01:06:53.083 --> 01:06:54.417
I was like, that's
excellent news, Nigel.

01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:56.041
I'm going to go
assist the movement.

01:06:56.125 --> 01:06:58.000
But some men went
to visit their Nigels,

01:06:58.083 --> 01:06:59.542
and their Nigels were like,

01:06:59.625 --> 01:07:03.250
-"Burn it down!"
-(laughter)

01:07:03.333 --> 01:07:04.834
And these are the men
that are trying

01:07:04.917 --> 01:07:06.542
to change the narrative
of the MeToo movement,

01:07:06.625 --> 01:07:08.375
and they're doing it in
a very, very intelligent way.

01:07:08.458 --> 01:07:09.834
They're doing it via deflection.

01:07:09.917 --> 01:07:11.333
They're bringing up things
that are important

01:07:11.417 --> 01:07:13.667
but not necessary to what
the discussion is about.

01:07:13.750 --> 01:07:15.166
They'll say things like,
"What about men?

01:07:15.250 --> 01:07:16.709
Men get sexually assaulted too."

01:07:16.792 --> 01:07:19.125
Yes, yes they do.
By men.

01:07:19.750 --> 01:07:23.000
Eighty-four percent of male
sexual assault survivors
were sexually assaulted by men.

01:07:23.083 --> 01:07:24.834
"But what about
all the false allegations?"

01:07:24.917 --> 01:07:27.291
Well, less than one percent
of rape allegations are false.

01:07:27.375 --> 01:07:30.417
"Well, it's a witch hunt!
It's a bloody witch hunt!"

01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:32.542
Well, it's not.

01:07:32.625 --> 01:07:35.875
-Mainly 'cause
witches didn't exist.
-(laughter)

01:07:35.959 --> 01:07:38.291
-That's why witch hunts
were shitty.
-(laughter)

01:07:38.375 --> 01:07:41.917
Every single woman that was
burned alive for being a witch
was innocent,

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.875
because there's no such thing
as fucking witches.

01:07:44.959 --> 01:07:47.000
There are such things
as rapists.

01:07:47.083 --> 01:07:48.709
It's not like
in 200 years' time,

01:07:48.792 --> 01:07:51.583
we're gonna find out
that rapists were also
mythical creatures.

01:07:51.667 --> 01:07:54.458
-(laughter)
-We're not going to glorify them

01:07:54.542 --> 01:07:56.166
in the same way that
we've glorified witches.

01:07:56.250 --> 01:07:58.375
In 50 years' time, you're not
going to see a bunch of kids

01:07:58.458 --> 01:08:00.875
running around on Halloween
dressed as R. Kelly.

01:08:00.959 --> 01:08:05.542
(laughter and applause)

01:08:05.625 --> 01:08:07.667
(cheering, whistling)

01:08:11.375 --> 01:08:13.917
-No.
-(laughter)

01:08:14.333 --> 01:08:16.082
If you've ever seen
my live shows before,

01:08:16.166 --> 01:08:18.750
you'll understand
that they follow a very
similar format every year.

01:08:18.834 --> 01:08:21.291
I do about 70 to 75 minutes
worth of jokes.

01:08:21.375 --> 01:08:24.500
Jokes that I enjoy telling,
jokes that I sincerely hope
you enjoy listening to.

01:08:24.582 --> 01:08:26.375
And then at the end,
once I've legally fulfilled

01:08:26.457 --> 01:08:27.875
my contract of
being a comedian,

01:08:27.959 --> 01:08:30.750
I do a sad
15 minute TED talk.

01:08:30.834 --> 01:08:32.625
(laughter)

01:08:32.709 --> 01:08:36.332
Now the reason I do this
at the end is just because,
like, my stand up, it's just--

01:08:36.417 --> 01:08:38.250
it's me talking to you about
all the stuff that's on my mind,

01:08:38.332 --> 01:08:39.750
and I'm a fucking silly moron.

01:08:39.834 --> 01:08:41.332
But sometimes I think
about serious things,

01:08:41.417 --> 01:08:42.917
and it feels disingenuous

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.500
to not talk to you about
everything that's on my mind.

01:08:45.582 --> 01:08:47.250
So, normally when I talk
about serious issues,

01:08:47.332 --> 01:08:49.625
I'll talk about something
I've got an experience in.

01:08:49.709 --> 01:08:50.875
I don't think that's crucial.

01:08:50.959 --> 01:08:52.375
It's just a choice
I've made so far.

01:08:52.457 --> 01:08:54.125
That's why in the past,
I've done jokes about death,

01:08:54.207 --> 01:08:56.582
because I had a sister that
died when I was eight years old.

01:08:56.667 --> 01:08:58.375
I've done jokes
about disability.

01:08:58.457 --> 01:08:59.625
She had cerebral palsy.

01:08:59.709 --> 01:09:01.457
I've done jokes about
having a giant dick.

01:09:01.542 --> 01:09:05.041
-It's a burden I must bear.
-(laughter)

01:09:06.207 --> 01:09:07.417
But when it comes
to sexual assault,

01:09:07.500 --> 01:09:09.332
even though I've never
been sexually assaulted

01:09:09.417 --> 01:09:11.291
and I've never done
a sexual assault,

01:09:11.375 --> 01:09:14.207
to say that it doesn't affect
me just isn't true,

01:09:14.291 --> 01:09:15.959
because it affects
people I know and love

01:09:16.041 --> 01:09:17.332
and that in turn affects me.

01:09:17.417 --> 01:09:19.041
Like one of my closest friends
for five years,

01:09:19.125 --> 01:09:20.457
she's been sexually assaulted.

01:09:20.542 --> 01:09:23.500
You don't get to tell me
that this isn't a me issue too.

01:09:23.582 --> 01:09:25.291
A little bit of
a backstory to her.

01:09:25.375 --> 01:09:27.417
The reason we became friends
is because she drinks
more than I do,

01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:28.792
she swears like a trucker,

01:09:28.875 --> 01:09:31.332
and she's the only person
that has ever told a joke

01:09:31.417 --> 01:09:34.417
that made me go,
Jesus fucking Christ!

01:09:34.500 --> 01:09:36.166
(laughter)

01:09:36.250 --> 01:09:39.207
And she's done that on
three separate occasions.

01:09:39.291 --> 01:09:42.332
-And I will tell you
all three.
-(laughter)

01:09:42.417 --> 01:09:44.917
Me and her were having
a dinner, uh, last year.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:46.667
Just we happened to be
in the same city.

01:09:46.750 --> 01:09:49.667
I was gigging,
she was working there,
pure fucking coincidence.

01:09:49.750 --> 01:09:51.207
Went out for food
after the show.

01:09:51.291 --> 01:09:52.500
While we were out having food,

01:09:52.582 --> 01:09:54.082
second coincidence
of the day happened.

01:09:54.166 --> 01:09:55.709
Two of my guy friends walked by.

01:09:55.792 --> 01:09:57.500
I'm like, what the fuck
are you cunts doing here?

01:09:57.583 --> 01:09:59.208
They're like,
"We're getting shit-faced.
Do you want to come?"

01:09:59.291 --> 01:10:00.750
I was like, uh-huh.

01:10:00.834 --> 01:10:02.333
And they were like,
"Who's that?"
And I introduced them.

01:10:02.417 --> 01:10:04.000
And it was one of those
nerve-wracking moments.

01:10:04.083 --> 01:10:07.417
I don't know if you've ever had
two social groups meet before,

01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:09.291
but it's kind of like
an Avengers movie

01:10:09.375 --> 01:10:11.875
where you're like, fuck,
I hope they get on.

01:10:11.959 --> 01:10:14.500
And they did, and they got out,
we went drinking.

01:10:14.583 --> 01:10:16.041
Now, about one or two
in the morning,

01:10:16.125 --> 01:10:18.375
I decided to go home just 'cause
I had a show the next day

01:10:18.458 --> 01:10:20.000
and I don't like being
hungover for shows

01:10:20.083 --> 01:10:22.333
-because I'm a professional--
-(laughter)

01:10:22.417 --> 01:10:25.250
-Well caught. That is
the first lie of the show.
-(laughter)

01:10:25.333 --> 01:10:27.875
Somebody gave me a joint,
and I went home for a wank.

01:10:27.959 --> 01:10:29.625
-And...
-(laughter)

01:10:29.709 --> 01:10:33.208
-I had a great wank.
Thank you for asking.
-(laughter)

01:10:33.291 --> 01:10:35.333
Two days later I met up
with her for breakfast,

01:10:35.417 --> 01:10:37.208
and I was like, so how was
the rest of the night?

01:10:37.291 --> 01:10:39.000
She was like,
"I'm not telling you."

01:10:39.083 --> 01:10:42.375
And I was like,
Oh, ho-ho-ho-ho. Fuck yes!

01:10:42.458 --> 01:10:43.542
(laughter)

01:10:43.625 --> 01:10:45.750
It's the international
sign of gossip.

01:10:45.834 --> 01:10:48.333
She goes, "I'm not telling you."
And I'm like, oh, you will.

01:10:48.417 --> 01:10:50.500
Tell me, tell me, tell me,
tell me, tell me.

01:10:50.583 --> 01:10:52.250
Eventually I managed
to get her to crack.

01:10:52.333 --> 01:10:53.709
It turns out after I'd left,

01:10:53.792 --> 01:10:57.125
one of my closest friends
of eight years raped her.

01:10:58.667 --> 01:11:04.291
Which is not information
that I wanted to receive
over breakfast.

01:11:04.375 --> 01:11:06.333
Uh, or at any meal.

01:11:06.417 --> 01:11:07.709
It's not like I was
sat there being like,

01:11:07.792 --> 01:11:09.667
well, this could have
waited until lunch.

01:11:09.750 --> 01:11:11.083
(laughter)

01:11:11.166 --> 01:11:15.083
I was horrified, I was shocked,
I was angry, I believed her.

01:11:15.166 --> 01:11:17.959
Uh, I asked the questions
that I think you want to ask

01:11:18.041 --> 01:11:19.291
when you're in that situation.

01:11:19.375 --> 01:11:22.667
I was like, are you okay?
and she was like,

01:11:22.750 --> 01:11:24.458
-"No!"
-(laughter)

01:11:24.542 --> 01:11:27.333
And I was like, yeah, no,
fair point, stupid question.

01:11:27.417 --> 01:11:29.458
Can I have another one please?

01:11:29.542 --> 01:11:31.625
And then I asked a question
that I didn't want to ask.

01:11:31.709 --> 01:11:35.000
Now, in hindsight I understand
that I should not have asked
this question,

01:11:35.083 --> 01:11:37.625
but I'm not going to lie to you
and tell you that I didn't.

01:11:37.709 --> 01:11:40.458
It was a ignorant question and
it came from an ignorant man.

01:11:40.542 --> 01:11:42.834
I asked the question.
I said, I have to ask,

01:11:42.917 --> 01:11:46.792
I've known this guy
for eight years.
Did you... did you say no?

01:11:46.875 --> 01:11:48.667
And these are
her words not mine.

01:11:48.750 --> 01:11:52.709
She went, "Yeah, more times
than the 2 Unlimited song."

01:11:53.375 --> 01:11:55.000
To which I said...

01:11:55.625 --> 01:11:59.166
-Fucking wh--
Fucking what song?
-(laughter)

01:11:59.250 --> 01:12:01.417
And she was like,
"Oh for Christ--
You know the...

01:12:01.500 --> 01:12:07.417
♪ No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no,
there's no limit ♪

01:12:07.500 --> 01:12:08.834
-Now...
-(laughter)

01:12:08.917 --> 01:12:10.583
I'm with most of you.

01:12:10.667 --> 01:12:13.458
As a human being that
makes me immeasurably sad,

01:12:13.542 --> 01:12:16.709
-but as a comedian, muwah!
-(laughter)

01:12:16.792 --> 01:12:18.875
That is such a stunning joke,

01:12:18.959 --> 01:12:21.041
and I can't express to you
how hard I laughed

01:12:21.125 --> 01:12:22.417
because it caught me off guard.

01:12:22.500 --> 01:12:23.834
I'd heard the worst thing
I'd heard in my life,

01:12:23.917 --> 01:12:25.417
and then this joke
sidelined me.

01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:26.667
And I saw the look in her eyes.

01:12:26.750 --> 01:12:28.458
I know that look of
"just fucking say it."

01:12:28.542 --> 01:12:30.250
-(laughter)
-Like, it made me
laugh so much.

01:12:30.333 --> 01:12:33.583
'Cause I understand making
jokes about a serious subject

01:12:33.667 --> 01:12:36.500
does not mean that you
do not take it seriously.

01:12:36.583 --> 01:12:38.542
It just means that for
a brief moment in time,

01:12:38.625 --> 01:12:41.667
you are not allowing it to have
all-consuming power over you.

01:12:41.750 --> 01:12:44.166
I understand the catharsis
of laughing at trauma.

01:12:44.250 --> 01:12:46.583
So, if her way of dealing with
a trauma at that moment in time

01:12:46.667 --> 01:12:48.500
is to make jokes about it,
you bet your fucking ass

01:12:48.583 --> 01:12:50.166
I'm going to allow
her to do that.

01:12:50.250 --> 01:12:52.333
Now, allow me to try
and alleviate some of the fears

01:12:52.417 --> 01:12:53.583
I imagine some of you have

01:12:53.667 --> 01:12:55.291
when I enter into
this type of routine.

01:12:55.375 --> 01:12:57.625
First things first,
I've asked if I can tell
her story on stage.

01:12:57.709 --> 01:12:59.500
It's one of
the first things I did.

01:12:59.583 --> 01:13:01.959
Since she's been through this,
we've been spending
a lot of time together.

01:13:02.041 --> 01:13:05.875
She goes to therapy now,
and we do a thing that we
like to call second therapy,

01:13:05.959 --> 01:13:08.083
which is after first therapy,
she comes to mine,

01:13:08.166 --> 01:13:11.291
-and we drink
17 bottles of wine.
-(laughter)

01:13:11.375 --> 01:13:14.000
And we get high
and we play computer games

01:13:14.083 --> 01:13:15.625
and we make fun
of her therapist

01:13:15.709 --> 01:13:17.375
-and...
-(laughter)

01:13:17.458 --> 01:13:18.959
It's actually better
than real therapy,

01:13:19.041 --> 01:13:21.208
despite what her therapist
will tell you.

01:13:21.291 --> 01:13:22.709
(laughter)

01:13:22.792 --> 01:13:25.250
But what the fuck does she know?

01:13:25.333 --> 01:13:27.291
-(laughter)
-But...

01:13:27.375 --> 01:13:29.208
As a man, talking openly

01:13:29.291 --> 01:13:31.500
about something I've never
spoken openly about before,

01:13:31.583 --> 01:13:35.291
rape, my understanding of it
went through the roof.

01:13:35.792 --> 01:13:37.125
And that's not a bad thing.

01:13:37.208 --> 01:13:39.458
I understood when I was
talking to her afterwards,

01:13:39.542 --> 01:13:41.458
this makes so much
more sense to me.

01:13:41.542 --> 01:13:43.041
I think I should talk
about this on stage,

01:13:43.125 --> 01:13:45.583
but obviously I won't do it
unless you want me to.

01:13:45.667 --> 01:13:47.417
Can I tell your story on stage?

01:13:47.500 --> 01:13:49.417
And she said, "Yes,

01:13:49.500 --> 01:13:52.417
but when has my permission ever
been needed for anything?"

01:13:52.500 --> 01:13:55.583
(audience groans)

01:13:55.667 --> 01:13:58.583
(scattered laughter, applause)

01:13:58.667 --> 01:14:02.041
(audience murmuring)

01:14:02.125 --> 01:14:04.625
-Well...
-(laughter)

01:14:04.709 --> 01:14:06.917
Except I didn't do that.
I laughed at that joke
for 25 minutes.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.083
-(laughter)
-Once I was done laughing,

01:14:09.166 --> 01:14:12.875
-and once she was done
doing laps of victory...
-(laughter)

01:14:12.959 --> 01:14:14.583
She was like,
"Yes, not only can you,

01:14:14.667 --> 01:14:16.917
I think that you should."
So, I'm going to.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.333
And this is when we arrive
at this point in the show.

01:14:19.417 --> 01:14:21.250
You've all paid to see
a comedy show,

01:14:21.333 --> 01:14:23.166
and I'm now talking about rape.

01:14:23.250 --> 01:14:25.291
And some of you, rightfully,

01:14:25.375 --> 01:14:27.875
do not want me to try
and make that funny.

01:14:27.959 --> 01:14:31.250
So here we are...
uncomfortable.

01:14:31.333 --> 01:14:33.959
-(laughter)
-I don't know if you've
seen me before,

01:14:34.041 --> 01:14:36.458
but I'm quite good at dealing
with uncomfortable situations.

01:14:36.542 --> 01:14:39.542
-Mainly because I create them.
-(laughter)

01:14:39.625 --> 01:14:41.166
Gonna ask for
a little bit of trust here.

01:14:41.250 --> 01:14:43.291
Remember at the start of the
show when I said I loved kids

01:14:43.375 --> 01:14:45.125
and you thought that was
going to be a pedo joke?

01:14:45.208 --> 01:14:47.458
Turns out it was a nice joke
about how much I loved
my goddaughter.

01:14:47.542 --> 01:14:49.083
Gonna ask for the same
type of trust here.

01:14:49.166 --> 01:14:50.959
Trust that my heart's
in the right place.

01:14:51.041 --> 01:14:53.875
And also, understand
that for the first time
ever in my fucking career

01:14:53.959 --> 01:14:57.166
I do not hold a controversial
opinion on a subject.

01:14:57.250 --> 01:14:58.542
Not only that,
it's the first time ever

01:14:58.625 --> 01:15:00.125
I can confidently say,
I'm telling a joke where

01:15:00.208 --> 01:15:02.792
we're all on the same side.
We're all on the same side.

01:15:02.875 --> 01:15:05.166
We all agree that rape is
the worst thing you can do.

01:15:05.250 --> 01:15:06.667
It is the worst thing
you can do.

01:15:06.750 --> 01:15:10.000
-Murder is justifiable.
-(laughter)

01:15:10.083 --> 01:15:12.417
-Of course it is.
-(laughter)

01:15:12.500 --> 01:15:15.417
-Not legally but to us.
-(laughter)

01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:17.166
If I was to talk to you
after this show,

01:15:17.250 --> 01:15:19.375
it'd be like, "Hey,
does anyone deserve to die?"

01:15:19.458 --> 01:15:21.667
You'd be like, "Daniel!
What a horrible thing to say!

01:15:21.750 --> 01:15:24.333
Why on earth would you ever--?
Yeah, who's on your list?"

01:15:24.417 --> 01:15:26.166
(laughter)

01:15:26.250 --> 01:15:30.250
You can under some extreme
circumstances justify murder.

01:15:30.333 --> 01:15:34.000
You cannot under any
circumstance justify rape.

01:15:34.083 --> 01:15:37.000
That's why you've never been
asked the moral question
in philosophy,

01:15:37.083 --> 01:15:43.000
"Hey, if you could go back
in time, would you rape Hitler?"

01:15:43.083 --> 01:15:46.208
(laughter)

01:15:48.583 --> 01:15:51.083
-N-N-No.
-(laughter)

01:15:51.166 --> 01:15:54.875
"No, but like when he's a baby?"
That's much worse!

01:15:54.959 --> 01:15:57.125
(laughter)

01:16:03.959 --> 01:16:05.792
Rape is the worst
thing you can do.

01:16:05.875 --> 01:16:07.417
So what do you do
when you find out

01:16:07.500 --> 01:16:09.959
that one of your closest friends
is not only capable of doing it,

01:16:10.041 --> 01:16:12.375
but has done it to someone
that you love dearly?

01:16:12.458 --> 01:16:14.333
Um, I didn't handle it well.

01:16:14.417 --> 01:16:16.208
I'm still not handling it
that well to be honest with you.

01:16:16.291 --> 01:16:19.375
It's a tough thing to process.
it's a hard thing
to come to terms with.

01:16:19.458 --> 01:16:21.000
He was one of
my closest friends.

01:16:21.083 --> 01:16:23.125
My initial reaction wasn't
a fucking strong one.

01:16:23.208 --> 01:16:25.667
It was one of, you know,
toxic masculinity,
one of violence.

01:16:25.750 --> 01:16:28.166
The caveman in my brain
was like, "Shall I take over?"

01:16:28.250 --> 01:16:30.291
And I was like, 100%.

01:16:30.375 --> 01:16:33.000
If there was ever a time
to hunter-gatherer,
it's fucking now.

01:16:33.083 --> 01:16:34.709
All I wanted to do
was just find him

01:16:34.792 --> 01:16:36.834
and just pin him down and put
his head on the side of the curb

01:16:36.917 --> 01:16:39.458
and just stamp on his head
repeatedly until he was dead.

01:16:39.542 --> 01:16:41.917
I'm like, that's the dictionary
definition of justice

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:43.917
if you own a Russian dictionary.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.750
-And...
-(laughter)

01:16:46.834 --> 01:16:49.291
I stood up and I was like,
I'm going to go beat him up.

01:16:49.375 --> 01:16:52.417
And she was like,
"Oh, for fuck sake.

01:16:52.500 --> 01:16:54.500
"No, you're not,
because if you beat him up,

01:16:54.583 --> 01:16:56.333
all you do is you
make him the victim."

01:16:56.417 --> 01:16:59.083
And I was like, I dunno what
to do with all of this anger!

01:16:59.166 --> 01:17:01.250
And she was like,
"Now you know how I feel."

01:17:01.333 --> 01:17:04.166
And I was like, whoa, I'll just
get back into my place.

01:17:04.250 --> 01:17:05.667
(laughter)

01:17:05.750 --> 01:17:08.333
-I'll be here
when you need me.
-(laughter)

01:17:08.417 --> 01:17:10.959
Do you know the WiFi--
doesn't matter.

01:17:11.041 --> 01:17:13.083
(laughter)

01:17:13.166 --> 01:17:15.583
She let me confront him,
I was allowed to do that.

01:17:15.667 --> 01:17:17.542
I wanted to-- It wasn't going
to change my opinion of him.

01:17:17.625 --> 01:17:19.458
But, yeah, I wanted to hear
what he had to say for himself.

01:17:19.542 --> 01:17:21.834
I wanted to hear the words
of a man I thought I knew.

01:17:21.917 --> 01:17:25.250
I sat him down and I stared
in his eyes the entire time
during the confrontation.

01:17:25.333 --> 01:17:26.959
I didn't break eye contact
at any point.

01:17:27.041 --> 01:17:29.291
It was a lot like
a game of hide-and-seek.

01:17:29.375 --> 01:17:31.333
(laughter)

01:17:31.417 --> 01:17:32.625
I looked dead into his eyes,

01:17:32.709 --> 01:17:35.291
I accused him,
and he admitted it.

01:17:35.375 --> 01:17:37.917
He fucking admitted it.
Oh, he made his excuses.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:39.959
"Oh, man, it was an accident,
I didn't mean to.

01:17:40.041 --> 01:17:42.959
"I was drunk,
it won't happen again.
Just back me up this once."

01:17:43.041 --> 01:17:44.875
I sort of removed myself
from the situation,

01:17:44.959 --> 01:17:47.875
and then I had to be
the bearer of bad news
to the rest of my guy friends,

01:17:47.959 --> 01:17:50.125
let them know that they were
friends with a fucking beast.

01:17:50.208 --> 01:17:52.834
They reacted with the same
level of maturity that I did.

01:17:52.917 --> 01:17:55.291
They were like, "We should
beat the shit out of him."

01:17:55.375 --> 01:17:57.083
And I was like, we can't
beat the shit out of him.

01:17:57.166 --> 01:17:59.417
Apparently if we beat
the shit out of him,
he becomes the victim.

01:17:59.500 --> 01:18:01.667
And they were like,
"We don't know what to do
with all this anger!"

01:18:01.750 --> 01:18:04.750
-And I was like, now you
know how women feel.
-(laughter)

01:18:04.834 --> 01:18:06.500
And they were like,
"Fuck, that's deep."

01:18:06.583 --> 01:18:08.709
and I was like, I know,
I thought of it myself.

01:18:08.792 --> 01:18:12.750
(laughter and applause)

01:18:14.291 --> 01:18:17.208
I'm just so woke, ugh!

01:18:17.291 --> 01:18:20.291
(laughter)

01:18:24.083 --> 01:18:26.667
We sat down, we discussed it
with each other.

01:18:26.750 --> 01:18:28.291
It wasn't a long discussion.
It was--

01:18:28.375 --> 01:18:29.959
We decided to do
what we thought was right.

01:18:30.041 --> 01:18:31.959
I don't know if this was right,
but this is what we did.

01:18:32.041 --> 01:18:34.041
We basically said to him
what you've done is unforgivable

01:18:34.125 --> 01:18:35.625
and we don't intend
to forgive you for this.

01:18:35.709 --> 01:18:37.041
Like, we don't have
your back throughout this.

01:18:37.125 --> 01:18:38.542
You're not our friend anymore.

01:18:38.625 --> 01:18:40.834
We want to believe this isn't
who you are, but clearly it is.

01:18:40.917 --> 01:18:43.041
So, go away and change
every single part of you

01:18:43.125 --> 01:18:44.500
that ever allowed that
to take place.

01:18:44.583 --> 01:18:47.041
Stop drinking,
stop doing drugs,
go to therapy.

01:18:47.125 --> 01:18:49.375
And even once you've
done all those things,
continue to fuck off

01:18:49.458 --> 01:18:52.041
'cause we just don't want
to hang out with you anymore.

01:18:52.125 --> 01:18:54.417
We found out two months
after that had taken place

01:18:54.500 --> 01:18:58.041
that he was still drinking,
still doing drugs,
hadn't gone to therapy.

01:18:58.125 --> 01:19:01.667
And we now know that it was
not an isolated incident.

01:19:02.250 --> 01:19:04.333
And he's still out there.

01:19:04.417 --> 01:19:06.083
People have asked if she's
going to go to the police.

01:19:06.166 --> 01:19:08.375
That's her decision.
I've encouraged her
to go to the police.

01:19:08.458 --> 01:19:10.375
The reason she's decided
not to is just because

01:19:10.458 --> 01:19:11.709
since this has taken place,

01:19:11.792 --> 01:19:13.333
he's now accusing her
of being a liar.

01:19:13.417 --> 01:19:15.542
He's changed his story.
He's now accusing me
of being a liar.

01:19:15.625 --> 01:19:18.250
And because I didn't
record the conversation
when he admitted it,

01:19:18.333 --> 01:19:20.250
there's no hard evidence
of what happened.

01:19:20.333 --> 01:19:22.250
And it's one of those horrible
moments when, you know,

01:19:22.333 --> 01:19:24.000
the police have
to scrutinize things.

01:19:24.083 --> 01:19:26.166
And for her,
it's just not something that
she wants to go through.

01:19:26.250 --> 01:19:28.041
And she was like, "Look,
I don't want to go through this.

01:19:28.125 --> 01:19:30.667
"It's just like--
I've got to get past this
as much as I can myself.

01:19:30.750 --> 01:19:32.750
"And I don't want to be seen
as a victim if it goes public.

01:19:32.834 --> 01:19:34.417
'Cause I'm not a victim,
I'm a survivor."

01:19:34.500 --> 01:19:37.083
And I was like, well that is
a bit of an understatement.

01:19:37.166 --> 01:19:38.792
I've been with you through
most of this process.

01:19:38.875 --> 01:19:40.041
You've made two
of the funniest jokes

01:19:40.125 --> 01:19:42.083
I've ever heard
regarding the subject.

01:19:42.166 --> 01:19:44.166
I have never seen
strength like it.

01:19:44.250 --> 01:19:46.750
You took a rape on the chin--
not my finest comment.

01:19:46.834 --> 01:19:48.583
(laughter)

01:19:48.667 --> 01:19:51.917
And she was like
"Actually, I can't remember
where he finished."

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:56.166
(audiences groaning, laughing)

01:19:59.500 --> 01:20:02.709
I'm going to need you
to stop doing that.

01:20:02.792 --> 01:20:04.125
(laughter)

01:20:04.208 --> 01:20:06.166
"That's what I said."

01:20:06.250 --> 01:20:09.875
(laughter and applause)

01:20:12.542 --> 01:20:15.709
She is funnier and stronger
than I'll ever be.

01:20:17.125 --> 01:20:18.583
She's also not wrong.

01:20:19.208 --> 01:20:22.375
If every single woman who has
experience of sexual assault
was to go to the police,

01:20:22.458 --> 01:20:23.875
there are not enough police
officers or courtrooms

01:20:23.959 --> 01:20:25.291
in the world to deal
with the problem.

01:20:25.375 --> 01:20:26.792
And that's not even
taking into consideration

01:20:26.875 --> 01:20:28.458
that the problem goes
all the way to the very top.

01:20:28.542 --> 01:20:30.458
And that's not my way of saying
you shouldn't go to the police.

01:20:30.542 --> 01:20:33.417
It's just my way of
letting you know how
big this fucking problem is.

01:20:33.500 --> 01:20:37.792
Ninety-seven percent
of rapists will not spend
a single day in jail.

01:20:37.875 --> 01:20:41.834
That is a real statistic.
That is fucking abhorrent.

01:20:41.917 --> 01:20:43.750
So how do we fix that?

01:20:43.834 --> 01:20:46.625
How does society--
how do we fix this?
How do we stop this happening?

01:20:46.709 --> 01:20:48.542
It's all I've been thinking
about for the past year.

01:20:48.625 --> 01:20:50.166
Over and over and over again.
How do you fix this?

01:20:50.250 --> 01:20:52.250
How do you stop this? How do
you prevent this from happening?

01:20:52.333 --> 01:20:53.834
And I've got no answers, man.

01:20:53.917 --> 01:20:57.542
The only thing I can think of
is it has to involve us.

01:20:57.625 --> 01:20:59.166
And by us, I mean men.

01:20:59.250 --> 01:21:01.041
Now, to the women in the room,
I know you know this.

01:21:01.125 --> 01:21:02.500
None of this is new
information to you.

01:21:02.583 --> 01:21:04.458
You've lived your life,
you've got your experiences,

01:21:04.542 --> 01:21:05.792
and your voices
are more important

01:21:05.875 --> 01:21:07.667
and necessary in this
discussion than mine.

01:21:07.750 --> 01:21:09.792
That being said,
I would still like to lend
my voice to the discussion.

01:21:09.875 --> 01:21:12.458
And to the men in the room,
I want to make something
crystal clear.

01:21:12.542 --> 01:21:14.917
This isn't an attack.
I'm not accusing you
of anything.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.500
And more importantly,
I'm not accusing
your friends of anything.

01:21:17.583 --> 01:21:19.417
I'm just trying to tell you
my experience,

01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:21.041
and this is my experience.

01:21:21.125 --> 01:21:24.709
I knew this man for eight years,
and he fucking did it.

01:21:24.792 --> 01:21:27.750
There are monsters amongst us,
and they look like us.

01:21:27.834 --> 01:21:28.959
If you are sick of the narrative

01:21:29.041 --> 01:21:30.500
that's currently
going on about men,

01:21:30.583 --> 01:21:32.875
feel free to change it,
but you have to get involved.

01:21:32.959 --> 01:21:34.709
Don't make the same mistake
I did for years,

01:21:34.792 --> 01:21:35.917
which was just sitting back
and being like,

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:37.208
well, I'm not
a part of the problem,

01:21:37.291 --> 01:21:38.792
therefore I must be
part of the solution.

01:21:38.875 --> 01:21:40.709
'Cause that's just not
how this fucking shit works.

01:21:40.792 --> 01:21:43.041
I believe and deep down
I know that most men are good.

01:21:43.125 --> 01:21:44.500
Of course we are.

01:21:44.583 --> 01:21:46.917
But when one in ten men are shit
and the other nine do nothing,

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:48.875
they might as well
not fucking be there.

01:21:48.959 --> 01:21:52.041
Being good on the inside
counts for absolutely fuck all.

01:21:52.125 --> 01:21:54.208
You have to actively be good
and get involved.

01:21:54.291 --> 01:21:56.041
Instead of having this
fucking hero complex

01:21:56.125 --> 01:21:57.667
of being like,
"I'm going to beat up a rapist,"

01:21:57.750 --> 01:22:00.625
fucking prevent one, stop one,
because I know it can be done

01:22:00.709 --> 01:22:02.792
because I know how
I fucking failed at it.

01:22:02.875 --> 01:22:06.500
Because if I'm being
100% honest with myself,

01:22:06.583 --> 01:22:08.792
were there signs
in my friend's behavior

01:22:08.875 --> 01:22:11.875
over the years towards women
that I ignored?

01:22:11.959 --> 01:22:13.625
The answer is yes.

01:22:13.709 --> 01:22:15.583
And then he raped my friend,

01:22:15.667 --> 01:22:17.959
and that's on me
until the day I die.

01:22:18.041 --> 01:22:19.959
Talk to your fucking boys.
Get involved.

01:22:20.041 --> 01:22:21.417
'Cause I'm going to be
honest with you lads,

01:22:21.500 --> 01:22:23.917
women are trying their hardest
to not get raped.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.917
Like, every day,
they try to not get raped.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:28.709
I think it's their priority.

01:22:28.792 --> 01:22:31.709
-Mine's is WiFi.
-(laughter)

01:22:31.792 --> 01:22:34.917
I can't do much.
I just won't do nothing anymore.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
And I'm just suggesting
that you do the same.

01:22:37.083 --> 01:22:39.250
Now, my friend, she's been
helping me write this end bit,

01:22:39.333 --> 01:22:40.625
'cause it's a very
sensitive subject

01:22:40.709 --> 01:22:42.125
and I want to try
and do it justice.

01:22:42.208 --> 01:22:44.291
And after the first preview,
I was very, very nervous.

01:22:44.375 --> 01:22:46.417
And I ran up to her and I was
like, what do you think?

01:22:46.500 --> 01:22:48.250
Do you think I'm making it
too much about me?

01:22:48.333 --> 01:22:50.625
And she was like "Yeah,
every second of every day."

01:22:50.709 --> 01:22:52.000
(laughter)

01:22:52.083 --> 01:22:54.709
"That's what you're doing
right now, you fucking moron."

01:22:54.792 --> 01:22:57.250
-And I was like--
-(laughter)

01:22:57.333 --> 01:23:00.291
-It means I love you.
-(laughter)

01:23:00.375 --> 01:23:02.542
She was like,
"That's the only way
you can do it.

01:23:02.625 --> 01:23:03.917
"Only talk about it
from your perspective.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:05.500
'Cause men will listen to you."
And they will.

01:23:05.583 --> 01:23:07.959
-Because I look like them.
-(laughter)

01:23:08.041 --> 01:23:09.250
And that's not fair,
but it's true.

01:23:09.333 --> 01:23:10.875
So, maybe we can use it
to our advantage.

01:23:10.959 --> 01:23:12.917
There's a very famous
experiment several years ago.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.667
Scientists worked out that
if you take a frog and you
put it into boiling water,

01:23:15.750 --> 01:23:17.083
the frog will
jump out immediately

01:23:17.166 --> 01:23:18.792
'cause it knows
it's about to die.

01:23:18.875 --> 01:23:20.000
Whereas if you take
the same frog

01:23:20.083 --> 01:23:21.542
and you put it
into cold water,

01:23:21.625 --> 01:23:23.291
if you slowly heat the water up,

01:23:23.375 --> 01:23:24.875
the frog is unable
to tell the difference

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.959
in the change in temperature
and it slowly boils to death.

01:23:28.041 --> 01:23:30.000
I'll be the water.

01:23:30.083 --> 01:23:33.291
Ladies, you're boiling
as you have every single right
to be at this point in time.

01:23:33.375 --> 01:23:35.500
So, what I'll do is
I'll put on a little comedy show

01:23:35.583 --> 01:23:37.709
and I'll spend the first 75
minutes starting off very cold,

01:23:37.792 --> 01:23:40.834
getting the men on side
with jokes that I know
they'll agree with.

01:23:40.917 --> 01:23:42.458
I'll say things like,
all right boys,

01:23:42.542 --> 01:23:44.291
do you like kids
and you're not a pedophile?

01:23:44.375 --> 01:23:47.333
-And they'll be like, "I do like
kids and I'm not a pedophile."
-(laughter)

01:23:47.417 --> 01:23:49.750
-"That's very well observed."
-(laughter)

01:23:49.834 --> 01:23:51.333
"Interesting.

01:23:51.417 --> 01:23:54.959
I want to listen to more of what
my twin brother has to say."

01:23:55.041 --> 01:23:57.125
I'm like, all right, boys,
do you like drinking?

01:23:57.208 --> 01:23:59.250
They're like, "Fucking hell,
I'm a complex individual,

01:23:59.333 --> 01:24:02.333
-but that's two for two.
He's absolutely nailed me."
-(laughter)

01:24:02.417 --> 01:24:03.709
"This is unbelievable.

01:24:03.792 --> 01:24:05.792
Is he a psychic or a comedian,
what is this show?"

01:24:05.875 --> 01:24:07.625
Come on!
(laughs gruffly)

01:24:07.709 --> 01:24:08.959
"There's no way
he'll get the third thing.

01:24:09.041 --> 01:24:10.291
The third thing
would be impossible."

01:24:10.375 --> 01:24:13.041
Pussies are confusing.
"Fuck me dead."

01:24:13.125 --> 01:24:15.041
(laughter)

01:24:15.125 --> 01:24:17.709
"Never has a man seen
into my soul so much."

01:24:17.792 --> 01:24:21.041
And then I'll slowly
turn the temperature up.

01:24:21.625 --> 01:24:24.208
Now, don't worry, I will leave
on an actual joke,

01:24:24.291 --> 01:24:26.208
so we don't all leave here sad.

01:24:26.291 --> 01:24:27.875
But before I go,
just to the men in the room,

01:24:27.959 --> 01:24:29.125
I want to make
something crystal clear.

01:24:29.208 --> 01:24:31.542
This is not meant to be
a fucking lecture

01:24:31.625 --> 01:24:34.125
or someone on their high horse
telling you something.

01:24:34.208 --> 01:24:35.834
It's a man who fell off
his fucking horse.

01:24:35.917 --> 01:24:38.125
It's a man who fucking failed,
and these are just the things

01:24:38.208 --> 01:24:40.041
I wished I'd known
a couple of years ago.

01:24:40.125 --> 01:24:43.208
If you think this does not
affect the women in your life,

01:24:43.291 --> 01:24:44.625
talk to them after this show

01:24:44.709 --> 01:24:47.291
and watch your world crumble
before your very eyes.

01:24:47.375 --> 01:24:50.250
If you think this does not
affect the women in your life,

01:24:50.333 --> 01:24:52.083
it's not because
it's not happening to them.

01:24:52.166 --> 01:24:54.000
It's because they don't
trust you enough

01:24:54.083 --> 01:24:55.417
to talk to you about it.

01:24:55.500 --> 01:24:56.917
And that's
the single worst thing

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:58.750
I ever learned about myself.

01:24:58.834 --> 01:25:00.250
Now, one of the main reasons

01:25:00.333 --> 01:25:01.750
I still want to change
sex education

01:25:01.834 --> 01:25:03.417
is 'cause I'm still
very traumatized by mine.

01:25:03.500 --> 01:25:05.125
Because when we were
ten years old,

01:25:05.208 --> 01:25:06.834
we were given
the birthing video.

01:25:06.917 --> 01:25:08.709
-Now...
-(groans)

01:25:08.792 --> 01:25:11.250
-Oh, you've seen it?
-(laughter)

01:25:11.333 --> 01:25:13.959
-Maybe you were in it.
-(laughter)

01:25:14.041 --> 01:25:15.875
Now, I actually I have
no problem with teenagers

01:25:15.959 --> 01:25:18.500
being shown the birthing video,
but not when I was ten.

01:25:18.583 --> 01:25:22.083
-I was scared of the dark,
never mind vagina.
-(laughter)

01:25:22.166 --> 01:25:25.917
The first pussy I ever saw
looked like the door
from The Shining  .

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.625
(laughter)

01:25:31.083 --> 01:25:33.750
And our head teacher, right?
She gave our teacher, like,

01:25:33.834 --> 01:25:35.667
the full video to take
home the night before

01:25:35.750 --> 01:25:37.125
just so she could
watch it herself,

01:25:37.208 --> 01:25:39.375
just so she didn't
freak out in front of us.

01:25:39.458 --> 01:25:41.375
Which does make sense,
but it meant the next day

01:25:41.458 --> 01:25:43.125
our teacher came
into school visibly drunk,

01:25:43.208 --> 01:25:47.250
-as she has every right to be.
-(laughter)

01:25:47.333 --> 01:25:48.875
She gathers us
all round the telly.

01:25:48.959 --> 01:25:51.125
She's like, "Come on,
you fucking, yeah."

01:25:51.208 --> 01:25:52.667
(laughter)

01:25:52.750 --> 01:25:55.041
She gets the VHS,
sticks it in the video player,

01:25:55.125 --> 01:25:56.834
presses play,
very quickly realizes

01:25:56.917 --> 01:25:59.291
that it's still at the end
from the previous night,

01:25:59.375 --> 01:26:01.792
and then pressed rewind.

01:26:01.875 --> 01:26:04.750
(laughter)

01:26:04.834 --> 01:26:08.625
-Some of you clearly
remember how VHS works.
-(laughter)

01:26:08.709 --> 01:26:10.291
It's not like Netflix or DVDs.

01:26:10.375 --> 01:26:12.458
It doesn't go straight back
to the start, does it?

01:26:12.542 --> 01:26:14.000
-Fuck!
-(laughter)

01:26:14.083 --> 01:26:17.625
So imagine, to the horror
of 20 ten-year-olds

01:26:17.709 --> 01:26:20.166
when you were learning
about the miracle of life,

01:26:20.250 --> 01:26:21.917
how you were brought
into this world.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
And it opens up
with a beautiful image

01:26:24.083 --> 01:26:27.000
-of this mother cradling
her newborn baby.
-(laughter)

01:26:27.083 --> 01:26:29.375
Staring into its deep blue eyes,

01:26:29.458 --> 01:26:31.667
sharing a loving gaze
with her husband

01:26:31.750 --> 01:26:35.667
who's just standing there
in awe of the miracle of life.

01:26:35.750 --> 01:26:39.083
And then this
fucking doctor just--

01:26:41.500 --> 01:26:45.083
(laughter)

01:26:45.166 --> 01:26:49.125
-Moonwalks in,
confiscates the baby.
-(laughter)

01:26:49.917 --> 01:26:52.583
Pries it from its mother's
loving embrace,

01:26:52.667 --> 01:26:54.709
shows it to the father
one last time,

01:26:54.792 --> 01:26:58.417
-as in "Say Goodbye!"
And then...
-(laughter)

01:26:59.417 --> 01:27:04.333
(laughter and applause)

01:27:09.792 --> 01:27:12.417
(laughter)

01:27:14.709 --> 01:27:17.583
Still a better hiding place
than anything Ava's ever
found though,

01:27:17.667 --> 01:27:19.500
-so I guess...
-(laughter)

01:27:19.583 --> 01:27:21.291
Sydney, you've been a pleasure.
I've been Daniel Sloss.

01:27:21.375 --> 01:27:23.208
Thank you very much, good night.

01:27:23.291 --> 01:27:29.458
(cheering and applauding)

01:27:29.542 --> 01:27:32.959
(whistling, cheering)

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.208
(cheers and applause continuing)

01:27:50.333 --> 01:27:53.333
(cheers and applause
grow louder)

01:28:05.166 --> 01:28:07.375
(cheers and applause fading)

01:28:09.834 --> 01:28:12.000
(audience murmuring)
