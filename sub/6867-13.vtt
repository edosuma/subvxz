I hate it. I look like a whore.

19:05.110 --> 19:07.738
And you made it all look so beautiful,
Woodhouse.

19:07.946 --> 19:09.106
- Thank you, thank you.
- Uh-huh.

19:09.314 --> 19:11.214
But don't thank him,
it sets a bad precedent.

19:11.416 --> 19:15.079
- And, plus, we still need a priest, so...
- How about a disgraced former minister?

19:15.287 --> 19:16.311
ARCHER: What?
PAM: What the shit?

19:16.522 --> 19:17.819
Long story, kind of boring...

what's really ironic?

19:26.031 --> 19:28.761
ALL: Barry?
- Yes, Barry, hi.

19:28.967 --> 19:33.404
And what's ironic is Archer,
besides sodomizing my fiancée...

19:33.605 --> 19:35.800
- What?
- Only by the strictest legal definition.

19:36.008 --> 19:37.873
- Threw me off a roof, twice.

19:38.076 --> 19:40.203
Dropped, Barry.
And how are you not dead?

19:40.412 --> 19:43.210
Because the Russians turned me into...

19:43.415 --> 19:44.814
- Oh, my God.
- That's awful.

19:45.017 --> 19:49.317

with flesh which now stands before you.

19:49.521 --> 19:50.920

19:51.123 --> 19:54.718
- Eight years on my secret project, wasted.
ARCHER: Hey, whoa, Barry, don't...

19:55.194 --> 19:59.324
Yeah, so back to the irony,
now I'm gonna throw you off the roof.

19:59.531 --> 20:01.328
Wow, Barry, you're, like, super strong.

20:01.533 --> 20:03.398
- Did I mention I was a cyborg?
- You did.

20:03.602 --> 20:05.194
- Can somebody shoot him?
- Dukes.

20:05.404 --> 20:07.895
- Archer, we're out of ammo.
- Well, I'm not.

20:08.106 --> 20:11.507

going to ruin my son's wedding...

20:11.710 --> 20:13.177
...it'll be me.

20:13.712 --> 20:17.409
What part of "I'm a cyborg"
are you people still not getting, exactly?

20:17.616 --> 20:19.584
Uh, core concept, I guess?

20:19.785 --> 20:21.013
No, wait, Katya, no.

20:21.220 --> 20:25.714
- Yes, I will save you, darling.
- No, no, no, don't. Katya!
