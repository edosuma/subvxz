00:27.040 --> 00:32.440
(Music)

00:45.440 --> 00:50.080
(Music)

02:25.680 --> 02:28.280
Now we want to take
everyone to North Korea.

02:28.440 --> 02:30.760
We have an unprecedented
investigation by

02:30.920 --> 02:33.880
the United Nations taking us
inside a kind of hell.

02:34.040 --> 02:41.040
-It's mad and sad and bad
and silly all in the same time.

02:41.200 --> 02:44.280
-Most tours go to North Korea
with very low expectations.

02:44.360 --> 02:46.360
Because everybody
watches the documentaries,

02:46.440 --> 02:47.480
reads the news, and so on.

02:47.640 --> 02:51.040
And even if 90 percent of
what they learn is not true,

02:51.200 --> 02:53.920
at least it's something
they've looked into.

02:54.080 --> 02:56.680
Because everybody knows
North Korea is an unusual place.

02:56.840 --> 02:59.640
Everybody knows they do things
differently to everyone else.

02:59.800 --> 03:01.440
What we ignore
is that there is life

03:01.600 --> 03:03.840
for 24 million people there.

03:06.640 --> 03:08.880
-The regime seeks
to dominate every aspect

03:09.040 --> 03:12.720
of its citizens' lives
and terrorizes them from within.

03:12.880 --> 03:17.680
We don't have much awareness
of the Western mentality,

03:18.120 --> 03:21.040
of how they perceive
the Koreans from outside

03:21.200 --> 03:23.080
from the rest of the world.

03:23.240 --> 03:25.360
-For the outside world
it's sort of a freak show.

03:25.520 --> 03:28.800
That's part of the fascination
with North Korea.

03:28.960 --> 03:32.720
There aren't that many real
mysteries left in the world,

03:32.880 --> 03:35.440
and this is a closed,
mysterious place.

03:38.120 --> 03:41.720
Due to the U.S. hostile policy
to our Korea,

03:42.040 --> 03:44.600
they try to isolate and,
you know,

03:45.760 --> 03:49.280
stifle our country,
consistently threaten our people.

03:50.160 --> 03:54.880
-The situation in North Korea
is extremely grave.

03:55.040 --> 03:58.720
The country
is a totalitarian regime.

03:58.880 --> 04:01.880
It is a regime
that doesn't respect

04:02.040 --> 04:04.880
the universal human rights
of its citizens.

04:05.040 --> 04:07.960
-Amnesty International,
which has been investigating

04:08.120 --> 04:10.560
human rights violations
for the last 50 years,

04:10.720 --> 04:14.680
we find North Korea to be
in a category of its own.

04:14.840 --> 04:16.920
There's a severe food crisis.

04:17.080 --> 04:19.560
Freedom of expression,
freedom of speech,

04:19.720 --> 04:22.040
freedom of association
is severely curtailed.

04:22.200 --> 04:24.800
-Torture, rape, forced
abortion, and execution.

04:24.960 --> 04:27.560
-Just unprecedented
crimes against humanity.

04:27.720 --> 04:29.680
And the world
can't close its eyes to that

04:29.760 --> 04:32.600
and pretend it's not there just
because there's a nuclear problem.

04:32.680 --> 04:34.840
-Pyongyang warns
an explosion is imminent,

04:35.000 --> 04:37.400
and war could break out
today or tomorrow.

04:37.560 --> 04:41.720
-North Korea does not
and will not benefit

04:41.880 --> 04:43.960
from violating international law.

04:44.120 --> 04:45.840
-How concerned should we be?

04:46.000 --> 04:47.840
-How dangerous is the situation?

04:48.000 --> 04:50.080
-This is how wars start.

04:50.240 --> 04:53.440
-Threats of terror-like violence
and another premiere cancelled.

04:53.600 --> 04:56.800
-We cannot have a society
in which some dictator someplace

04:56.960 --> 04:58.880
can start imposing censorship

04:59.040 --> 05:00.920
here in the United States.

05:01.080 --> 05:03.400
Because if somebody is able
to intimidate folks

05:03.560 --> 05:07.000
out of releasing
a satirical movie,

05:07.160 --> 05:10.160
imagine what they'd start doing
when they see

05:10.320 --> 05:12.160
a documentary
that they don't like.

06:44.400 --> 06:48.560
We honor, we honor
to the highest degree

06:48.840 --> 06:53.200
our Great Leader Kim Jong-un
we honor to the highest degree.

06:53.600 --> 06:58.040
We honor, we honor
to the highest degree

06:58.520 --> 07:02.600
our Great Leader Kim Jong-un.

07:03.200 --> 07:07.000
We honor to the highest degree.

07:32.680 --> 07:35.000
North Korea is known
as the Hermit Kingdom,

07:35.160 --> 07:37.080
and there is a reason for this.

07:37.240 --> 07:40.680
It is almost impossible to get in,
especially with a camera.

07:43.840 --> 07:46.880
Over the centuries, Korea
has been invaded more than 100 times

07:47.040 --> 07:49.400
by its powerful neighbors
China and Japan.

07:50.360 --> 07:53.680
Today, it remains the last
stronghold of communism.

07:59.120 --> 08:02.440
My name is Alvaro Longoria.
I am a filmmaker from Spain.

08:04.280 --> 08:07.960
For many years, I have been rather
fascinated by North Korea.

08:08.120 --> 08:10.520
Probably like you, I have wondered:

08:10.680 --> 08:13.680
Is everything we read and hear
about North Korea really true?

08:13.840 --> 08:17.200
Over the next days,
is my quest to seek out the truth.

08:29.720 --> 08:32.120
After many failed attempts
to get into the country,

08:32.280 --> 08:34.160
I heard about Alejandro,

08:34.320 --> 08:37.440
the only foreigner who works
for the government of North Korea.

08:37.600 --> 08:39.240
I contacted him through Facebook

08:39.400 --> 08:42.200
and a year later, we were officially
invited into the country.

08:42.360 --> 08:43.720
Sponsored by Alejandro,

08:43.880 --> 08:45.880
and provided we followed
their strict rules,

08:46.040 --> 08:48.400
we would be granted
privileged access.

08:48.560 --> 08:52.800
(Music)

08:58.560 --> 09:00.600
We were put
on a predetermined itinerary

09:00.680 --> 09:02.480
and could not leave
the hotel alone.

09:03.320 --> 09:06.240
At all times we were accompanied
by our Korean guides.

09:06.720 --> 09:10.280
In theory, we were allowed to
interview anybody we wanted.

09:10.520 --> 09:15.960
(Music)

09:28.120 --> 09:32.280
-Korea is a small country
thousands of miles away.

09:32.440 --> 09:36.280
But what is happening
there is important to every
American.

09:36.440 --> 09:38.960
-A highly trained and well-equipped
North Korean army

09:39.120 --> 09:41.520
swarmed across the 38th parallel
to attack

09:41.680 --> 09:43.840
unprepared South Korean defenders.

09:44.000 --> 09:44.880
(Explosions)

09:45.040 --> 09:47.640
-The scene was set for a war
between North and South.

09:47.800 --> 09:50.960
With the North supplied
by China with tacet backing

09:51.120 --> 09:52.960
from the Soviet Union.

09:53.120 --> 09:56.720
And the South supported
by the United States and its allies.

09:56.880 --> 09:58.640
-The cost was high to Americans

09:58.800 --> 10:00.640
who bore the brunt
under the UN banner.

10:00.800 --> 10:03.800
Here they faced an enemy who
ruthlessly slaughtered prisoners,

10:03.960 --> 10:06.160
many with their arms bound.

10:06.320 --> 10:10.760
(Music)

10:10.920 --> 10:13.680
-First films
of the ceremonies at Panmunjom

10:13.840 --> 10:15.960
that end 3 years
of bitter, costly conflict.

10:16.120 --> 10:20.680
(Music)

10:20.840 --> 10:23.880
The bulky agreement spells out
in minutest detail

10:24.040 --> 10:25.560
every provision of the truce.

10:25.720 --> 10:27.960
The ceasefire is good news
to the men at the front,

10:28.120 --> 10:30.160
but it is almost sombre here.

10:30.320 --> 10:32.800
Every UN member present
knows that the big problems

10:32.960 --> 10:36.560
remain to be solved, even
if the enemy acts in good faith.

10:36.720 --> 10:40.080
But there is hope.
A big step forward has been taken.

10:40.240 --> 10:41.760
The armistice becomes official.

10:41.920 --> 10:42.960
The fighting is over.

10:43.120 --> 10:46.000
Prisoners will be exchanged,
but there is little rejoicing.

10:46.160 --> 10:50.400
The Cold War is on,
and the Free World wonders what
next.

11:07.440 --> 11:10.040
On day one, we headed
to the South Korean border,

11:10.640 --> 11:12.440
the most militarized
in the world,

11:12.960 --> 11:15.480
wrongly named the
"Demilitarized Zone".

11:17.000 --> 11:19.240
In the 200 km highway
from Pyongyang,

11:19.760 --> 11:21.080
we only saw one car,

11:21.560 --> 11:23.600
a couple of bicycles
and a bus.

11:29.840 --> 11:32.720
Until September of 1945,
when the U.S. occupied South Korea,

11:32.880 --> 11:36.280
the 38th parallel marked the
division between the North and the
South.

11:36.440 --> 11:39.240
The intention of the U.S.
when they occupied South Korea,

11:39.400 --> 11:42.240
was to provoke a war
with North Korea

11:42.400 --> 11:45.720
and to keep advancing to the north
of the country to rule over all of
Asia.

11:45.880 --> 11:48.880
This is the division of the country
that was made back then

11:49.040 --> 11:50.840
and has remained untouched

11:51.120 --> 11:54.720
causing misery and distress
for more than half a century.

11:55.320 --> 11:58.160
Around this line there is
an area of 4 km called

11:58.240 --> 11:59.960
the "Demilitarized Zone".

12:00.560 --> 12:03.520
Panmunjom is the most
unstable place in the world

12:03.680 --> 12:07.480
where 2 nations at war are not
separated by a physical border.

12:07.640 --> 12:11.680
(Music)

12:12.440 --> 12:15.200
The Demilitarized Zone
was not what we expected.

12:16.960 --> 12:20.480
(Music)

12:40.800 --> 12:43.400
This is probably the most
dangerous place in the world.

12:43.560 --> 12:47.200
At the moment that's what they say
the most heavily militarized...

12:47.360 --> 12:49.920
But here it's very peaceful,
on our side.

12:50.120 --> 12:52.160
On our side it looks very relaxed.

12:52.560 --> 12:54.840
To be honest, we were expecting
something much more...

12:55.200 --> 12:56.320
Except for the clapping.

12:59.480 --> 13:00.800
Over there, that's South Korea

13:01.200 --> 13:02.880
and those blue buildings
are the border.

13:04.240 --> 13:07.880
This place is strange and it feels
like a tourist attraction.

13:10.200 --> 13:11.320
This is the only place

13:12.120 --> 13:15.280
where we can cross
from the North to the South.

13:16.880 --> 13:20.600
This room has been the setting
for approximately 12,000 meetings

13:20.760 --> 13:22.960
since the end of the war
until March of 1991.

13:23.120 --> 13:26.040
The purpose of these meetings was
to denounce the acts of provocation

13:26.120 --> 13:28.800
and the violations of the conditions
of the armistice by the U.S.

13:28.880 --> 13:31.200
Since the end of the war until 1991,

13:31.360 --> 13:34.440
more than 815,000 infractions
have been registered

13:34.640 --> 13:36.760
committed by the U.S. government.

13:38.080 --> 13:40.760
The violation of the conditions
of the armistice

13:40.960 --> 13:44.120
has caused that, at any time,
nuclear war could break out in
Korea.

13:44.760 --> 13:46.880
In order to preserve peace
in Korea and in the World,

13:47.000 --> 13:49.480
we need to design a new system
that can assure peace

13:49.640 --> 13:50.880
between us and the U.S.

13:52.160 --> 13:56.960
But the U.S. keeps doing
military tests

13:57.760 --> 13:59.760
and every year they increase

14:00.080 --> 14:02.920
the deployment of nuclear weapons
in South Korea.

14:06.200 --> 14:09.000
Our victory is not recognized
by the U.S.

14:09.160 --> 14:10.680
and doesn't appear in their books.

14:10.840 --> 14:13.280
We do not know
how it will be taught in the future.

14:13.640 --> 14:15.760
Documents, they showed

14:16.000 --> 14:18.320
how the war was prepared
by the North Koreans.

14:18.480 --> 14:20.840
Evidence from the
Russian and Chinese archives

14:21.040 --> 14:22.320
was published 20 years ago,

14:22.840 --> 14:24.720
but most North Koreans
still believe

14:25.120 --> 14:27.800
the war was initiated
by the Americans.

14:29.160 --> 14:30.320
When I was in North Korea

14:31.040 --> 14:34.400
I was taught that America
started the Korean War

14:34.560 --> 14:37.520
but when I came to South Korea
and studied the history,

14:37.680 --> 14:40.440
I realized that
it was actually North Korea

14:40.600 --> 14:42.200
that first attacked South Korea.

14:42.360 --> 14:45.360
We always explain the Korean War
was started by the U.S.

14:45.520 --> 14:48.280
although there was
a fight going on

14:48.480 --> 14:52.280
because our guerillas
led by President Kim Il-sung,

14:52.680 --> 14:54.240
liberated the Northern half

14:54.640 --> 14:57.400
while the U.S. was advancing
from the South.

14:57.600 --> 15:01.360
Then they collided and there were
many skirmishes and fighting.

15:02.000 --> 15:06.080
Even if the Americans
recognize their wrongdoing,

15:06.440 --> 15:08.800
we won't let them
enter our country,

15:09.120 --> 15:10.880
nor will we let them
sign this treaty.

15:11.040 --> 15:13.960
In school we are taught

15:14.440 --> 15:17.080
that the United States

15:17.280 --> 15:20.320
is the cause
of our economic hardship

15:21.440 --> 15:24.880
and the reason why
our lives are so difficult.

15:25.480 --> 15:28.880
That is why the North Koreans
believe the U.S. is to blame

15:29.440 --> 15:34.960
for their mortification
and their dissatisfaction.

15:35.200 --> 15:38.000
It is all the fault
of the United States.

15:38.160 --> 15:41.800
(Dramatic music playing)

15:47.840 --> 15:50.520
We cannot live like enemies forever.

15:50.960 --> 15:53.440
Some people change their policies,

15:54.120 --> 15:57.000
or apologize for the past

15:57.200 --> 15:59.720
but, speaking of Americans
they never did.

15:59.920 --> 16:02.080
Imperialists are still...

16:02.520 --> 16:05.360
they didn't throw away
their policy.

16:07.000 --> 16:10.080
They're sanctioning
and stifling ours.

16:10.480 --> 16:12.200
So defending our country,

16:12.880 --> 16:15.840
of course, that matter comes first.

16:16.280 --> 16:20.560
Military force is very important,

16:21.360 --> 16:25.120
so we are enforcing
Songun politics

16:26.800 --> 16:28.840
even in present times.

16:29.960 --> 16:31.240
"Army first" politics.

16:31.600 --> 16:33.960
It means a country
without a powerful army

16:34.520 --> 16:35.320
cannot survive.

16:35.480 --> 16:36.880
It will be always dependent

16:37.800 --> 16:39.200
on the big superpowers.

16:40.200 --> 16:42.120
The principle
of the Songun revolution

16:42.400 --> 16:45.200
is that the army is the party,
the nation and the people.

16:45.520 --> 16:50.280
This means the party
can only subsist and prosper

16:51.480 --> 16:53.280
thanks to the military forces.

16:54.040 --> 16:57.280
Songun is a statement by
the North Korean Government.

16:57.640 --> 17:01.080
The soldiers are the most
progressive class in the society,

17:01.400 --> 17:05.080
who is playing the leading role
in defining its political line.

17:06.440 --> 17:10.160
These statements however are
completely unrelated to reality,

17:10.320 --> 17:14.400
it's just the rhetoric exercise
by the professional ideologues.

17:16.200 --> 17:22.520
Korea spends 16% of its GDP
on the military.

17:22.680 --> 17:25.120
This is huge,
considering the economic situation

17:25.360 --> 17:27.400
where there is widespread
hunger and poverty.

17:27.560 --> 17:30.480
However,
given the geographic location,

17:30.640 --> 17:32.880
Korea needs to keep up
this investment

17:33.120 --> 17:35.680
as they have to be prepared
for war at any moment.

17:42.200 --> 17:45.600
-North Korea, the secretive nation
with its mysterious

17:45.760 --> 17:48.000
young dictator,
announcing they will test their

17:48.160 --> 17:49.960
nuclear power,
a rocket big enough

17:50.120 --> 17:52.960
and with enough range
to reach the west coast

17:53.120 --> 17:54.840
of the United States.

17:57.800 --> 17:59.880
May represent
the most advanced technology

18:00.040 --> 18:02.360
we've ever seen
come out of North Korea.

18:02.520 --> 18:03.600
-It's terrifying.

18:03.760 --> 18:05.560
-So thrilled was this country

18:05.720 --> 18:08.760
by their rocket launch
fireworks ripped through the sky.

18:08.920 --> 18:12.440
North Korean newscasters
announced the successful launch

18:12.600 --> 18:14.200
with ecstasy.

18:14.360 --> 18:19.640
The launch has been a success!

18:20.040 --> 18:26.200
(Music)

18:27.000 --> 18:30.720
We are always
on the verge of nuclear war.

18:31.080 --> 18:33.240
The U.S. is allowed to have

18:33.480 --> 18:35.480
the highest amount
of nuclear weapons.

18:35.640 --> 18:39.000
We cannot afford
to be unprotected.

18:39.680 --> 18:44.520
(Music)

18:56.520 --> 19:00.040
North Korea aims
for the nuclear bomb

19:00.240 --> 19:01.480
since the 90s,

19:02.000 --> 19:03.440
because, until then,

19:03.640 --> 19:07.280
it has been protected
by the soviet nuclear umbrella.

19:07.640 --> 19:12.800
And this is something
that the Western media always
forget:

19:13.160 --> 19:15.600
Korea has always been
under the threat

19:15.760 --> 19:17.400
of the Western nuclear weapon

19:17.560 --> 19:18.280
always.

19:18.440 --> 19:21.640
We are forced
you can understand it,

19:22.000 --> 19:26.240
when they are organizing
a sort of big campaign,

19:26.400 --> 19:27.800
a military campaign,

19:28.720 --> 19:32.640
and execute military rehearsals
every year

19:32.960 --> 19:34.240
in front of our nose,

19:35.240 --> 19:37.560
we can't stay with folded arms

19:37.840 --> 19:39.560
we have to do
our part of the job.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.920
This is self-defense, definitely.

19:43.080 --> 19:45.400
-These are among
the biggest simulated battles

19:45.560 --> 19:47.680
staged anywhere in the world.

19:47.840 --> 19:50.080
And, on occasion,
these exercises have provoked

19:50.240 --> 19:53.040
a violent reaction from the North.

19:54.560 --> 19:56.680
Sometimes the North
has held its own exercises

19:56.840 --> 19:59.400
determined to show
its military might.

19:59.560 --> 20:02.960
On other occasions,
the bombardment has been real.

20:05.160 --> 20:07.160
It's much more interesting
to analyze

20:07.520 --> 20:09.480
the "menace"

20:09.720 --> 20:13.800
that North Korea represents
for the rest of the world.

20:14.440 --> 20:16.560
It's a country
that has never invaded others,

20:16.880 --> 20:21.240
whose army is basically made of
junk.

20:21.440 --> 20:23.320
It's like comparing

20:24.440 --> 20:25.760
a space station

20:26.440 --> 20:27.480
with a toaster.

20:28.040 --> 20:29.400
(Gunfire)

20:29.560 --> 20:30.960
-It's not a joke.

20:31.120 --> 20:33.000
It's a country
with the fourth largest

20:33.160 --> 20:34.960
standing army in the world.

20:35.120 --> 20:37.240
It's a country
which is armed to the teeth

20:37.400 --> 20:41.640
with 20 nuclear warheads
and with an increasingly

20:41.800 --> 20:43.720
sophisticated missile delivery
system.

20:44.440 --> 20:50.880
If we didn't protect ourselves,
if we weren't strong,

20:51.160 --> 20:56.440
we would succumb
to the menace of imperialism.

20:56.640 --> 20:59.400
Armed robbery
has to be answered with weapons.

20:59.600 --> 21:03.720
A powerful army needs to be prepared
to overthrow the imperialist
invader.

21:04.680 --> 21:08.840
(Music)

21:17.000 --> 21:18.360
It's a credible argument,

21:18.880 --> 21:23.480
It's not a crazy idea of the Kims',
to get nuclear weapons,

21:23.680 --> 21:25.440
it is a matter of survival.

21:25.600 --> 21:27.960
Based on what happened
to Saddam Hussein

21:28.120 --> 21:31.960
after they did engage
in some disarmament,

21:32.120 --> 21:34.880
so the North Koreans
feel that the only thing

21:35.040 --> 21:37.760
that's protecting them
is their nuclear weapons.

21:37.920 --> 21:40.480
Do you think if you didn't have
the nuclear weapon

21:40.640 --> 21:42.440
you would have been invaded?

21:43.240 --> 21:44.560
Most probably, yes.

21:45.960 --> 21:49.440
Only by building a powerful
and nuclear deterrence force

21:49.680 --> 21:53.880
we can stop the bullying
and the threats from the U.S.

21:54.960 --> 21:58.040
My dream has always been

21:58.280 --> 22:00.200
to be a member
of our Korean People's Army

22:00.360 --> 22:01.520
since I was so young.

22:02.040 --> 22:07.720
(Music)

22:08.440 --> 22:10.680
I could say that I am born in Spain,

22:10.880 --> 22:14.040
I am born Spanish
but adopted North Korean.

22:15.400 --> 22:17.760
The way he speaks
about our country,

22:18.000 --> 22:20.800
the way he appreciates our country,

22:21.440 --> 22:24.000
is very much valued
by our people.

22:24.400 --> 22:25.320
they like him.

22:25.680 --> 22:26.760
And sometimes,

22:27.680 --> 22:28.840
in the streets,

22:29.080 --> 22:30.640
some Koreans recognize him

22:30.880 --> 22:32.840
"Oh, hello, I saw you before!",

22:33.520 --> 22:36.320
and "I am so happy to meet you!"
like that.

22:38.480 --> 22:41.040
There are a lot of sympathizers.

22:42.280 --> 22:48.320
But it is not often
that someone goes as far

22:49.720 --> 22:54.240
as to be willing
to give his life for us,

22:54.440 --> 22:56.720
like Alejandro.

22:57.160 --> 22:58.920
When I was 16,
I had my first encounter

22:59.000 --> 23:00.400
with the minister Li Jong Gun

23:01.040 --> 23:03.640
and he instructed me
on what the country really means

23:03.840 --> 23:07.240
and this was my first relationship
with a North Korean friend.

23:07.400 --> 23:09.280
He had seen my potential
and he told me:

23:09.440 --> 23:12.560
"Alejandro, you cannot waste
your capacity, your knowledge,

23:12.880 --> 23:15.920
as a soldier of the People's Army.
We have millions of soldiers.

23:16.080 --> 23:18.240
But we don't have anyone
who understands,

23:18.400 --> 23:20.480
who's been born into capitalism,

23:20.640 --> 23:23.760
and who can act as a bridge
between both cultures,

23:23.920 --> 23:25.440
between both ideologies.

23:25.600 --> 23:28.360
Our party, our country,
needs you outside."

23:28.520 --> 23:30.520
He was like a mentor to Alejandro.

23:31.200 --> 23:32.560
He told me once:

23:32.800 --> 23:35.920
"Your son is the number one Korean."

23:36.080 --> 23:38.600
It was a surprise for us.

23:38.760 --> 23:42.080
We knew very little
about the country.

23:42.600 --> 23:45.120
So you are influenced by the ideas,

23:45.280 --> 23:47.400
the news, everything you hear.

23:47.680 --> 23:48.440
It affects you.

23:48.760 --> 23:51.640
So, we were somehow...

23:51.840 --> 23:53.680
not afraid,

23:53.840 --> 23:55.720
but we felt we needed
to act with caution

23:56.120 --> 23:59.640
and we told him to be very aware

24:00.040 --> 24:01.960
and to take precaution.

24:02.160 --> 24:04.680
He had an interest in communism,

24:05.200 --> 24:08.320
he was looking
for that model society,

24:08.480 --> 24:12.040
a society that distributed
the riches among all citizens,

24:12.200 --> 24:15.400
that was fair,
because he hadn't found one.

24:15.560 --> 24:17.800
So when he was a member
of political parties

24:17.960 --> 24:20.040
like Izquierda Unida,
or the Communist Party

24:20.200 --> 24:22.280
he realized that
the ideas were beautiful,

24:22.440 --> 24:25.800
but the people in charge

24:25.960 --> 24:26.680
were

24:27.200 --> 24:28.240
selfish,

24:29.080 --> 24:30.000
ambitious,

24:30.960 --> 24:33.600
and that clashed
with his personality

24:33.880 --> 24:35.360
so he kept looking.

24:35.880 --> 24:38.720
The way to reach
the socialist paradise

24:38.880 --> 24:42.080
depends on our Great Leader
Kim Jong-il.

24:42.840 --> 24:46.240
Long live our Great Leader
Kim Jong-il!

24:47.400 --> 24:50.800
Long live the DPRK!

24:52.200 --> 24:57.960
(Applause)

24:58.120 --> 25:04.000
(Music)

25:04.640 --> 25:06.840
Where are you taking us now?

25:07.000 --> 25:10.120
We are going to the Mansu bronze
statues of our Great Leaders,

25:10.280 --> 25:13.320
President Kim Il-sung and
our Generalissimo Kim Jong-il.

25:13.480 --> 25:16.600
We are going to present a flower
bouquet as a symbol of respect

25:16.800 --> 25:17.800
for April 15th,

25:17.960 --> 25:20.520
which is the birthday anniversary
of President Kim Il-sung.

25:20.600 --> 25:22.640
Everybody can buy flowers

25:22.960 --> 25:25.400
and offer them
as a symbol of respect

25:25.600 --> 25:27.920
for his work and dedication
for the revolution.

25:28.280 --> 25:31.200
That's a tradition.
In all national holidays,

25:31.480 --> 25:34.760
even when you marry, to come
and pay respect to our leaders

25:34.920 --> 25:36.760
because, more than anything,

25:37.080 --> 25:39.360
the leaders are our fathers.

25:39.560 --> 25:40.880
We are part of a big family,

25:41.160 --> 25:43.640
and, in that family
the figures of the leaders

25:43.840 --> 25:47.080
are like the fathers
of the full society.

25:47.920 --> 25:50.520
(Music)

26:08.520 --> 26:13.680
Our hearts are full of respect
for our leaders.

26:14.320 --> 26:18.080
We come here often,
as if this were our own house,

26:18.280 --> 26:19.960
to thank them.

26:20.880 --> 26:26.680
We North Koreans feel very proud

26:26.960 --> 26:30.120
of having leaders

26:30.320 --> 26:32.320
that the whole world admires.

26:32.520 --> 26:36.480
(Music)

26:41.680 --> 26:43.240
Good morning, sir.

26:43.600 --> 26:46.760
-I'm Alejandro, the Spanish soldier.
-He's a soldier of our General.

26:46.920 --> 26:50.200
He is doing a great job
making relations for our country.

26:50.440 --> 26:51.600
Yes, my General.

26:52.480 --> 26:54.320
So is he a veteran from the war?

26:55.640 --> 26:58.280
He fought in the revolution war.

27:00.360 --> 27:02.000
I went to the river Nakdong.

27:02.680 --> 27:05.480
Then I fought with
the Chinese People's Army.

27:12.080 --> 27:14.200
I hope in my life
to follow his footsteps

27:14.360 --> 27:16.680
and also give my life
for the motherland

27:16.840 --> 27:19.040
and preserving socialism
and our Great Leaders.

27:24.040 --> 27:27.240
We feel very, very proud

27:27.440 --> 27:31.040
and we feel very strong.

27:31.200 --> 27:36.000
We have the motivation
to fight against imperialism.

27:36.160 --> 27:39.880
And they won't be able to attack us,
we are a very strong country.

27:46.600 --> 27:48.240
I am 82 years old.

27:50.000 --> 27:53.280
Thanks to Great Leader Kim Jong-il
and to Kim Jong-un

27:53.520 --> 27:56.200
veterans like me

27:56.440 --> 27:59.800
enjoy many benefits
from the government.

28:00.280 --> 28:04.320
For example, we have a house,
but there are many other things.

28:04.720 --> 28:07.080
We have a special card
for medical assistance

28:07.400 --> 28:09.840
and we receive all kinds
of treatments and care.

28:10.000 --> 28:13.880
We also have access to limited food,
like some vegetables.

28:14.080 --> 28:17.720
In general we enjoy many
commodities.

28:19.440 --> 28:22.680
Life in this country
as opposed to capitalism,

28:22.920 --> 28:24.800
is guaranteed for all the people.

28:24.960 --> 28:26.960
Housing, medical service,

28:27.160 --> 28:30.440
education in the university
food, clothing,

28:30.640 --> 28:34.320
whatever you need in the daily life
is provided, guaranteed for free.

28:34.520 --> 28:39.280
All the necessary daily necessities
we get from the government.

28:39.600 --> 28:41.640
We don't pay taxes,

28:42.040 --> 28:43.920
we don't pay for the houses...

28:44.880 --> 28:47.480
Under the wise leadership
of our Marshal Kim Jong-un,

28:47.680 --> 28:50.160
the economy of our country
is developing step by step.

28:50.560 --> 28:53.680
As you may see, in Pyongyang there
are many new apartment houses

28:53.880 --> 28:57.680
and new museums and many recreation
places for the people.

28:57.880 --> 29:00.280
Not only in Pyongyang
but also in the countryside,

29:00.480 --> 29:04.960
we are constructing amenities
facilities and many places

29:05.280 --> 29:11.000
which is conducive to improving
the livelihood of the people.

29:11.760 --> 29:13.760
Our Great Leader
Comrade Kim Jong-il

29:13.960 --> 29:17.480
first defended the country
and then created the foundation

29:17.720 --> 29:20.920
on which we can
improve our economy.

29:22.000 --> 29:22.920
So, are you happy?

29:23.160 --> 29:23.960
Yes.

29:24.760 --> 29:30.360
(Music)

29:31.120 --> 29:34.320
Ok, so here is the main building
of the War Museum.

29:34.800 --> 29:38.600
As you see here the museum
consists of three floors.

29:39.160 --> 29:40.720
And you see this is a statue

29:40.800 --> 29:43.360
of the Great Leader President
Kim Il-sung,

29:43.680 --> 29:46.320
who defeated two imperialisms
in one generation.

29:46.640 --> 29:49.760
As you know he defeated
the Japanese army and the Americans.

29:50.280 --> 29:51.720
And here we'll make a line

29:51.960 --> 29:55.520
and we'll make a bow to our Great
Leader President Kim Il-sung.

30:00.240 --> 30:01.440
We were alone there,

30:01.600 --> 30:04.440
despite the fact that it's Sunday
and it should be full.

30:04.600 --> 30:06.160
It's hard to understand why that is.

30:06.320 --> 30:08.640
Maybe it's only the military
that go there,

30:08.800 --> 30:11.760
maybe it's not open for regular
people... We don't know.

30:13.880 --> 30:15.240
It's nearly built, now.

30:15.480 --> 30:17.960
There were many specialists,
designers...

30:18.400 --> 30:20.760
But I am sure
Marshal Kim Jong-un

30:20.960 --> 30:23.080
instructed it
from the start to the end.

30:23.520 --> 30:26.280
This panorama is an oil painting,

30:26.680 --> 30:31.000
it's 15 metres high
and 132 metres long

30:31.360 --> 30:33.920
and 42 meters diameter.

30:34.280 --> 30:39.520
Also it's only 13.5 metres away
from your seat to the picture

30:39.800 --> 30:43.000
but you can see more than
40 kilometres away from the picture.

30:43.160 --> 30:44.960
So, watching this,
are you proud?

30:46.600 --> 30:48.240
Yes, very proud.

30:49.040 --> 30:52.160
The Korean people can visit here
and they can experience

30:52.760 --> 30:55.200
how the Korean People's Army

30:55.680 --> 30:57.600
have fought against the invaders.

31:23.120 --> 31:25.800
Now we can take the route
of Marshal Kim Jong-un.

31:26.800 --> 31:27.720
Did he...

31:27.880 --> 31:29.240
use the machines?

31:34.360 --> 31:35.600
That's the one.

31:37.120 --> 31:38.920
Muscle development machine used

31:39.000 --> 31:41.440
by our esteemed Supreme Leader
Kim Jong-un.

31:54.040 --> 31:57.720
When our respected Marshal
Comrade Kim Jong-un

31:57.920 --> 32:00.120
was looking around this,

32:00.400 --> 32:03.320
it was not a slide, there was a
step.

32:03.640 --> 32:05.520
But he told us, very wisely

32:05.800 --> 32:08.800
if there is a step, people will get
hurt, by the sharp edges,

32:09.160 --> 32:11.960
and he told our construction workers

32:12.240 --> 32:14.240
to change this into a slide.

32:15.920 --> 32:18.840
Socialist hamburgers
hot dogs, chicken wings...

32:19.000 --> 32:20.320
Not the American McDonald's.

32:20.480 --> 32:23.920
Not American
communist state products.

32:24.160 --> 32:28.320
(Music)

32:29.160 --> 32:32.720
For the first time in five days,
we are alone.

32:33.520 --> 32:35.040
It's amazing...

32:35.200 --> 32:36.400
Oh, here they come.

32:39.800 --> 32:41.720
This building was built
only last year

32:41.880 --> 32:45.160
so this is the most updated
and modern.

32:45.320 --> 32:46.520
Very luxury.

32:47.840 --> 32:49.560
Watching U.S. movies is prohibited,

32:49.800 --> 32:52.880
strangely, Disney's "Brave"
was playing on the TV.

32:53.640 --> 33:00.040
This building has 300 apartments
and they are all the same.

33:00.440 --> 33:06.200
They are presents from Kim Jong-un
to teachers for spreading his word.

33:06.440 --> 33:08.480
Can you ask her
to show us the fridge?

33:15.800 --> 33:17.800
What is she cooking for tonight?

33:17.960 --> 33:22.000
She is too shy.
We never saw the fridge.

33:23.400 --> 33:26.640
(Shrieking)

33:27.400 --> 33:30.040
One question that keeps on
coming back to my mind is:

33:30.960 --> 33:32.600
where is the money coming from?

33:32.960 --> 33:34.400
Lots of new constructions...

33:34.600 --> 33:37.240
Lots of new stuff like this
I mean, this is not a set.

33:40.480 --> 33:42.920
Would you say that living conditions
have improved?

33:43.160 --> 33:44.480
Not only my family,

33:44.720 --> 33:48.400
but all Korean people are happy
to lead such happy, civilized lives

33:48.560 --> 33:51.080
and we are enjoying
this updated amusement park,

33:51.400 --> 33:52.960
so we are happy.

34:44.800 --> 34:46.520
After only 5 days in Pyongyang,

34:47.000 --> 34:49.200
the constant propaganda
was starting to work.

34:50.680 --> 34:53.160
With enough time
maybe even I could be convinced.

35:54.520 --> 35:55.600
What does he do?

35:57.520 --> 35:59.000
I was in the army

36:01.000 --> 36:03.440
but now I have entered university.

36:03.840 --> 36:05.800
So after the army
he went to university.

36:06.560 --> 36:08.000
What is he studying?

36:10.320 --> 36:11.560
Locomotive driver.

36:15.040 --> 36:17.200
What is his aspiration in life?

36:17.880 --> 36:19.720
His dream? His goal?

36:24.360 --> 36:25.480
My dream?

36:29.200 --> 36:33.240
I want to be a locomotive driver

36:34.960 --> 36:36.600
to work for my Great Leader.

36:37.080 --> 36:39.840
-There's a system in North Korea
called songbun.

36:40.000 --> 36:43.560
And it's a ranking
by your loyalty

36:43.720 --> 36:45.600
to the leadership.

36:45.760 --> 36:48.280
And people are divided
into a core class

36:48.440 --> 36:53.080
of those who are considered
the party members

36:53.240 --> 36:55.680
and the real supporters
of the regime.

36:55.840 --> 36:57.560
And then there's a wavering class

36:57.720 --> 36:59.960
in the middle, the vast middle,

37:00.120 --> 37:03.680
and then the undesirables
at the bottom.

37:03.840 --> 37:05.960
And where you live,
what kind of job you have,

37:06.120 --> 37:11.040
where you go to school,
that's based on your class.

37:12.680 --> 37:16.760
There are three free benefits
in North Korea:

37:17.080 --> 37:23.440
free housing, free medical care
and free education.

37:23.880 --> 37:27.000
Although there is free medical
care, there is no medicine to cure,

37:27.480 --> 37:30.600
and with free housing you cannot
choose where you want to live

37:31.120 --> 37:35.360
and with free education you have
to learn the ideology of the regime

37:35.560 --> 37:37.320
even if you don't want to.

37:38.480 --> 37:44.240
We salute him
when we go to school

37:44.640 --> 37:49.800
and we salute him again
when we go back home.

37:52.800 --> 37:55.720
He is the one
who loves us the most

37:56.440 --> 38:00.760
us, the children.

38:01.760 --> 38:06.680
Our father, General Kim Jong-il.

38:07.520 --> 38:10.760
(Music)

38:10.920 --> 38:14.400
-North Koreans are brainwashed
from the minute they're born.

38:14.880 --> 38:17.520
Almost the first thing
they learn to say is

38:17.680 --> 38:19.640
"thank you, dear leader."

38:20.360 --> 38:26.680
He is the one who loves us the most,
us, the children.

38:27.040 --> 38:32.320
Our father, General Kim Jong-il.

38:32.760 --> 38:40.720
Our father, General Kim Jong-il.

38:42.480 --> 38:46.960
(Applause)

38:47.120 --> 38:50.120
(Music)

39:02.120 --> 39:04.560
First it's education,
obviously it's very important,

39:04.640 --> 39:05.520
since you are a kid,

39:05.680 --> 39:08.000
that you grow up
and you learn to live

39:08.200 --> 39:10.560
according to the ideology
to the communism.

39:11.160 --> 39:11.960
Then, of course,

39:12.040 --> 39:14.840
the education provided
not only by professors or teachers

39:15.000 --> 39:18.440
but the mass media
or televisions, newspapers and so on

39:18.960 --> 39:21.160
work on human values

39:22.120 --> 39:25.720
and try to make the people better
in their daily lives.

39:26.080 --> 39:28.480
(Music)

39:29.240 --> 39:34.960
We think that everything
that appears in the film,

39:35.280 --> 39:38.480
all the workers and all the people,

39:38.840 --> 39:41.000
must collaborate
in benefit of the people.

39:41.160 --> 39:44.240
(Music)

39:53.640 --> 39:56.280
Propaganda can also be used
as a means of education

39:56.880 --> 39:59.560
to contribute to the culture
of our citizens.

40:00.120 --> 40:03.400
-Kim Jong-il was
very involved in film.

40:03.560 --> 40:07.120
He wrote a book called Kim Jong-il
on The Art of Cinema

40:07.280 --> 40:10.040
explaining how film
could be used to instill

40:10.200 --> 40:12.960
patriotism in the masses.

40:13.120 --> 40:17.960
They certainly recognize
the role of domestic propaganda.

40:18.120 --> 40:21.680
(Music)

40:34.160 --> 40:37.680
The idea Juche,
created by Kim Il-sung,

40:37.880 --> 40:41.800
was developed by Kim Jong-il.
It establishes the principle

40:42.000 --> 40:44.560
that if we leave everything
in the hands of society,

40:44.720 --> 40:46.280
the latter can decide everything.

40:47.120 --> 40:52.320
It's a concept
that cannot be compared

40:52.520 --> 40:55.360
to any other ideology of the past

40:55.520 --> 40:59.880
or the teachings of Confucius.

41:01.840 --> 41:05.640
-It probably began
in the idealism of a kind of

41:05.800 --> 41:10.920
communism, but also
a kind of nationalism

41:11.080 --> 41:13.440
and romantic historicism.

41:13.600 --> 41:15.760
-It kind of started out
as kind of a humanistic

41:15.920 --> 41:18.600
approach to philosophy,
a humanistic idea

41:18.760 --> 41:20.960
that man was
the centre of the universe,

41:21.120 --> 41:23.880
that man could go accomplish
all of his problems.

41:24.040 --> 41:26.800
And it became--
like Kim Jong-il as the worship

41:26.960 --> 41:28.720
of the dear leader,
it really became

41:28.880 --> 41:30.040
a way to control.

41:30.200 --> 41:34.440
It's an ideology
that intends to combine

41:35.200 --> 41:38.000
Marxism Leninism,

41:38.280 --> 41:40.200
the ideas of Mao Zedong

41:40.640 --> 41:42.160
and religion.

41:42.880 --> 41:46.640
Of course, to make
a combination of all

41:47.360 --> 41:51.000
that you need to make it
so nobody can understand it.

41:51.360 --> 41:55.560
If no one can understand it,
no one will protest against it.

41:56.080 --> 41:59.400
It basically says
man is the master of all things.

42:01.000 --> 42:03.680
And everything has to be done
in a peculiar way

42:04.400 --> 42:06.960
which is suitable
for this current situation.

42:07.320 --> 42:08.320
Wonderful.

42:08.680 --> 42:10.640
Such a great philosophical
discovery.

42:12.040 --> 42:15.360
And if you look at what North
Koreans write about Juche

42:15.520 --> 42:18.680
you see it's a platitude
after platitude.

42:19.120 --> 42:23.040
Juche ideology in North Korea
is like the Bible in Christianity,

42:23.280 --> 42:25.240
it's like words from God,

42:25.440 --> 42:27.240
so North Koreans have to believe

42:27.320 --> 42:29.800
the Juche ideology
without any questions.

42:30.120 --> 42:33.400
What they need to do
is to learn it by heart.

42:33.840 --> 42:36.200
They know it,
and they can recite it,

42:36.360 --> 42:37.360
like the Quran

42:37.760 --> 42:38.880
or the Bible.

42:41.080 --> 42:43.760
Who is going to dare to say:
"I don't understand this."

42:44.240 --> 42:46.000
No one dares,

42:46.320 --> 42:48.840
much less so
in a country like Korea.

42:49.160 --> 42:50.680
You don't understand it?

42:50.840 --> 42:53.400
North Koreans
don't understand it either.

42:53.560 --> 42:55.000
I had a strict education.

42:55.160 --> 43:00.280
If I didn't believe
what I was being taught,

43:00.440 --> 43:03.000
I was punished.

43:03.560 --> 43:05.000
I can basically say

43:05.360 --> 43:06.240
Juche is nothing.

43:07.640 --> 43:11.280
Because you can basically
summarize Marxism

43:11.440 --> 43:14.160
but you cannot summarize Juche.

43:16.200 --> 43:17.880
Is this clear?

43:18.160 --> 43:21.080
Could you summarize, briefly
what the Juche idea is?

43:23.960 --> 43:27.840
Are you a specialist in philosophy?

43:28.360 --> 43:29.480
No, I try to understand.

43:30.080 --> 43:35.960
The best explanation
is to see our reality.

43:36.440 --> 43:39.880
It's better to know our country
than to listen to me a hundred
times.

43:40.160 --> 43:43.360
It's better to see our reality
than to listen to my words.

43:44.560 --> 43:51.560
(Music)

44:38.280 --> 44:41.200
What you see here is
three huge doors,

44:41.360 --> 44:44.400
metallic, that will close
in the event of a U.S. attack.

44:44.800 --> 44:46.960
One, two and three
will be completely sealed

44:47.240 --> 44:49.680
from the exterior, you see?
All these frames?

44:56.400 --> 44:57.280
In case of attack,

44:58.440 --> 45:01.640
everything is ready to use
the underground transportation
system

45:01.800 --> 45:05.320
to move the people
and shelter hundreds of thousands.

45:41.560 --> 45:42.920
Maybe him?

45:43.960 --> 45:45.240
Or all of them

45:46.160 --> 45:47.200
at the same time?

45:55.880 --> 45:56.520
Him?

45:59.440 --> 46:01.520
Good morning, sir.

46:02.880 --> 46:05.760
He is a director from Spain.

46:06.240 --> 46:09.080
-It's a pleasure.
-The same.

46:10.000 --> 46:12.640
He would like to ask you
some questions.

46:13.000 --> 46:15.560
In many countries
especially in the Western world,

46:16.040 --> 46:17.400
people are very impressed

46:17.560 --> 46:19.160
with the love and reverence

46:19.320 --> 46:22.560
of the Korean people as one family
united around their leader.

46:22.920 --> 46:25.320
They cannot understand
the power of that unity.

46:25.720 --> 46:27.600
What would you say
to those people,

46:27.840 --> 46:29.840
in other countries of the world

46:30.000 --> 46:31.080
that don't understand?

46:31.400 --> 46:34.800
How can there be
such a single-minded unity?

46:43.160 --> 46:46.080
I cannot think of a specific way

46:46.280 --> 46:50.480
to explain it to the people
who don't understand us.

46:51.120 --> 46:54.760
But if they came here,
if they saw the reality,

46:56.120 --> 46:58.440
maybe they could understand us.

46:58.960 --> 47:01.720
That would be worth
a thousand words.

47:02.480 --> 47:04.280
It would be much more convincing.

47:07.360 --> 47:08.880
What he says is true:

47:09.080 --> 47:11.240
if you don't come,
if you don't see it,

47:11.400 --> 47:14.960
if you don't ask the people,
you'll never believe it.

47:15.200 --> 47:17.080
That is the strength of Korea.

47:18.240 --> 47:20.640
-Most foreigners
have never met a North Korean.

47:20.800 --> 47:23.000
Most North Koreans
have never met a foreigner.

47:23.160 --> 47:25.720
The view that we have of them
is very negative.

47:25.880 --> 47:28.080
The view they have of us
is even more negative.

47:28.240 --> 47:29.680
-Where are you from?
-Spain.

47:32.320 --> 47:34.240
Do you know where Spain is?

47:40.320 --> 47:42.600
Why are you here in DPRK?

47:43.080 --> 47:46.640
Because we want to know
how people live here.

47:52.560 --> 47:53.760
We are very happy.

47:56.640 --> 47:58.120
Are they as happy as we are?

47:58.720 --> 48:00.000
Do they have a president?

48:00.600 --> 48:04.680
In Spain are there also
people who love children?

48:05.040 --> 48:06.880
All kids like you like football.

48:07.040 --> 48:09.280
What is your favorite
Spanish league team?

48:09.800 --> 48:11.800
-Koreo!
-No, Spanish league.

48:12.600 --> 48:14.080
Barcelona!

48:15.600 --> 48:17.320
Me, Atlético de Madrid.

48:18.920 --> 48:21.520
Is it better and more beautiful
than here?

48:22.400 --> 48:24.600
Some parts are similar

48:24.840 --> 48:26.920
but this country is very beautiful.

48:29.120 --> 48:32.280
So many foreigners
when they first come to our country,

48:33.200 --> 48:37.040
they are just, you could say
surprised, at the realities.

48:37.440 --> 48:41.960
When they come and see this
they say: "This is wonderful."

48:54.120 --> 48:56.800
When they come here
and they see the Korean people

48:56.960 --> 48:58.920
wearing different dresses
they say:

48:59.760 --> 49:03.520
"Wow, when I was abroad,

49:04.040 --> 49:05.760
there was a propaganda that said

49:06.040 --> 49:08.760
that Korean people had to wear
only one uniform,

49:09.200 --> 49:10.680
you know, just like

49:10.960 --> 49:13.080
one clothing, with no differences".

49:13.640 --> 49:14.520
I think

49:16.280 --> 49:18.960
foreigners need to come here
and see the reality.

49:19.120 --> 49:21.840
-I understand
that especially with North Korea,

49:22.000 --> 49:26.280
you've got so much misinformation
and so little information.

49:26.440 --> 49:28.200
It's not
so much misinformation,

49:28.360 --> 49:31.520
I feel that any scrap of information
that the West gets,

49:31.680 --> 49:35.440
it's like, well, they did this,
let's make a story out of it.

49:35.600 --> 49:37.600
And there's no information on it.

49:37.760 --> 49:41.400
-When there's a vacuum,
it's easy to create

49:41.560 --> 49:45.240
and make it believable.

49:45.400 --> 49:51.000
Sometimes they are created
as a parody,

49:51.160 --> 49:54.120
and it still rings true.

49:54.280 --> 49:58.040
Why, because we just know
so little about the country.

50:02.440 --> 50:05.120
North Korea is an unimaginable
country.

50:12.080 --> 50:13.560
There is only one TV channel.

50:16.600 --> 50:17.880
There is no Internet.

50:24.160 --> 50:26.840
We aren't free to sing, say,

50:27.280 --> 50:30.240
wear or think what we want.

50:39.160 --> 50:41.320
North Korea is the only country
in the world,

50:42.120 --> 50:43.640
that executes people,

50:44.000 --> 50:46.760
for making unauthorized
international phone calls.

50:51.880 --> 50:53.720
-The North Korean government
has announced

50:53.880 --> 50:56.080
that it found a unicorn.

50:56.240 --> 50:56.960
(Laughing)

50:57.120 --> 50:59.560
-Ah, foreigners are funny.

50:59.720 --> 51:02.360
-A unicorn is a mythical creature
that the Greeks

51:02.520 --> 51:06.200
first mentioned,
but it's in North Korea.

51:06.360 --> 51:08.880
Now my question to you
is if you were

51:09.040 --> 51:12.440
a unicorn, you would go
to North Korea, right?

51:12.600 --> 51:15.160
I mean that's the only place
you'd want to be is there.

51:15.320 --> 51:17.640
-But everything's like
that with North Korea.

51:17.800 --> 51:20.920
It's always an exaggeration
and a parody and, you know,

51:21.080 --> 51:23.680
kind of a freak show,
which I think those of us

51:23.840 --> 51:27.280
who cover North Korea
find a little bit distressing

51:27.440 --> 51:30.000
because it's not actually very funny

51:30.160 --> 51:32.600
to the 24 million people
who live there.

51:32.760 --> 51:35.720
-The price
of such limited information flow

51:35.880 --> 51:40.960
back and forth is
that we perpetuate stereotypes

51:41.120 --> 51:44.280
of a country or a society.

51:44.440 --> 51:48.120
And I think that's the danger,
that's the price that we pay

51:48.280 --> 51:53.760
when we close off a country
or we isolate a country,

51:53.920 --> 51:55.360
like North Korea.

51:55.520 --> 51:57.960
-North Korea local media
reporting that men now

51:58.120 --> 52:00.320
have to wear their hair
just like their leader,

52:00.480 --> 52:02.360
Kim Jong-un.

52:02.520 --> 52:04.840
-So when we hear oh,
everybody has to have

52:05.000 --> 52:07.600
the same haircut,
you think well, you know,

52:07.760 --> 52:11.360
if that was true anywhere
it would probably be true there.

52:11.520 --> 52:14.000
-Haircuts have reportedly
been state-approved

52:14.160 --> 52:15.880
in North Korea for some time.

52:16.040 --> 52:20.120
Men could choose between
10 hairstyles, women 18.

52:20.960 --> 52:23.840
It was mandatory in North Korea

52:24.080 --> 52:28.400
that everybody cut their hair
in 14 different styles.

52:28.840 --> 52:29.960
There are 18 styles.

52:30.280 --> 52:32.800
Of course the women
can chose their own style,

52:33.400 --> 52:37.120
and if the hairstyle they want
is not here,

52:37.280 --> 52:40.160
then they can ask the hairdresser
"I want this, this, this..."

52:40.360 --> 52:41.000
And it's ok.

52:41.520 --> 52:46.360
There isn't any kind of rule saying
you can cut it only this way, no,

52:46.560 --> 52:50.160
it's the Western propaganda
on our country,

52:50.760 --> 52:52.200
it's unacceptable.

52:53.240 --> 52:56.800
I was quite surprised to be asked
that kind of question, you know,

52:56.960 --> 52:57.920
when you first asked

52:58.480 --> 53:00.720
but it's not true, you know?

53:00.880 --> 53:03.280
-I don't accept
that there is propaganda

53:03.440 --> 53:04.560
against North Korea.

53:05.320 --> 53:07.520
There is no democracy
there is no free press,

53:07.720 --> 53:10.160
there is no... whatever bullshit...
frankly speaking.

53:10.720 --> 53:11.440
This is a war.

53:11.760 --> 53:13.800
And in the war
we defend our idea.

53:14.000 --> 53:16.600
-We defend our equality.
-Are we in a propaganda war?

53:16.920 --> 53:18.200
Yeah, that's right.

53:18.480 --> 53:21.920
And I'm proud to be in the forefront
of that propaganda war.

53:22.320 --> 53:24.400
-On Tuesday
a shadowy group of hackers

53:24.560 --> 53:26.600
calling themselves
Guardians of Peace

53:26.760 --> 53:28.600
threatened violence
of 9/11 proportions

53:28.760 --> 53:30.560
against movie theatres
that showed

53:30.720 --> 53:33.280
the Seth Rogen-James Franco
comedy about a plot

53:33.440 --> 53:35.480
to kill North Korean leader
Kim Jong-un.

53:36.280 --> 53:37.280
It's an act of war,

53:37.840 --> 53:40.440
it's a direct insult
and a mockery.

53:40.760 --> 53:43.320
But it's a special mockery
because in this case

53:43.600 --> 53:45.720
they are killing a living leader

53:46.120 --> 53:49.680
which is never allowed or tolerated
in any other country of the world.

53:49.920 --> 53:51.520
And I want to insist on that,

53:51.680 --> 53:56.400
this movie, if Obama took the place
of our leader Kim Jong-un

53:56.720 --> 53:59.440
it will be considered immediately
a terrorist act.

53:59.840 --> 54:01.520
For them it was a supreme,

54:02.400 --> 54:06.400
it was a kind of offense
a serious offense,

54:07.280 --> 54:09.000
because it was a blasphemy.

54:09.480 --> 54:12.360
I hope and I wish
they will lose a lot of money.

54:12.560 --> 54:15.040
It has created enough trouble
in Sony Pictures

54:15.560 --> 54:18.760
but it will not be
as profitable as they thought.

54:18.920 --> 54:20.600
-"The Interview" has become

54:20.760 --> 54:23.480
the most successful online movie
ever to be released

54:23.640 --> 54:24.960
by the studio.

54:25.120 --> 54:27.000
The film raked
in over $15 million

54:27.160 --> 54:29.440
and was downloaded
more than 2 million times.

54:29.600 --> 54:33.000
(Music)

54:33.680 --> 54:37.520
The children wanted to wave
to the foreign guests.

54:37.760 --> 54:40.320
They were waving
and saying bye bye,

54:40.600 --> 54:41.680
but he took pictures,

54:42.040 --> 54:44.800
and put them in the newspaper
or a magazine,

54:44.960 --> 54:49.280
making the comment that the children
were asking for help.

54:49.440 --> 54:53.680
-We don't get instructions
from the government,

54:53.840 --> 54:58.960
nor from our editors
as to what specifically to do.

54:59.120 --> 55:02.960
That is a common perception,
I know, in China as well.

55:03.120 --> 55:09.120
But, no, I have to clearly say
we are never

55:09.280 --> 55:12.040
an extension of US policies.

55:12.760 --> 55:14.720
In the newspaper there was a photo

55:14.880 --> 55:18.080
where the children
were receiving the scarves.

55:18.240 --> 55:20.240
The explanation
of the photograph said:

55:20.400 --> 55:23.560
"Preparing to be military."

55:24.560 --> 55:25.560
It said that.

55:30.560 --> 55:32.120
It was fake.

55:32.320 --> 55:34.840
It's manipulation.
They use a photograph

55:35.000 --> 55:38.240
and then manipulate the text
around it to generate falseness.

55:38.560 --> 55:40.960
-A rally staged
by the Korean Children's Union,

55:41.120 --> 55:43.280
they pledge allegiance
to the state and get

55:43.440 --> 55:44.520
their red scarves.

55:45.720 --> 55:50.000
They asked us if all the Korean
people were suffering from hunger

55:51.000 --> 55:52.320
if they had nothing to eat,

55:53.040 --> 55:54.160
they said that...

55:54.560 --> 55:55.440
Not at all!

55:55.840 --> 55:59.720
They also spoke about executions,
saying we killed people in public.

56:00.840 --> 56:04.040
-Authorities reportedly
machine-gunned 8 hooded people

56:04.200 --> 56:06.560
in front of a crowd of 10,000
in a sports stadium

56:06.720 --> 56:08.280
in the port city of Wonsan.

56:09.800 --> 56:12.840
Which crimes are committed
in my country against humanity?

56:13.160 --> 56:16.560
Crimes against humanity
in political prison camps,

56:17.440 --> 56:21.280
crimes against humanity
in ordinary prison system,

56:22.000 --> 56:25.840
crimes against humanity
targeting religious believers

56:26.120 --> 56:29.960
and others considered to introduce
subversive influences.

56:31.080 --> 56:33.680
The COI report is totally

56:34.640 --> 56:37.520
and severely distorting
and faking up

56:37.920 --> 56:39.840
our real situation of human rights

56:40.200 --> 56:41.120
in DPRK

56:41.640 --> 56:43.920
by creating political confrontation.

56:44.240 --> 56:47.640
And the reason for those findings
are set out in detail

56:48.000 --> 56:51.240
supported by actual testimony
in each case.

56:52.160 --> 56:55.400
Even the Western mass media
report that

56:56.040 --> 56:59.840
the most probable testimonies
made by defectors

57:00.440 --> 57:03.080
are forced by leading questions.

57:05.880 --> 57:08.800
The guards
were not trained to torture

57:10.160 --> 57:13.440
but to shoot anyone who rebelled
or tried to escape.

57:13.880 --> 57:16.200
We were told that if a war started

57:16.640 --> 57:21.080
we had to kill every prisoner
to erase the evidence.

57:21.640 --> 57:23.680
That was my job.

57:29.480 --> 57:31.520
Torture,
battering on a large scale...

57:31.840 --> 57:35.280
Specially in the prison camps

57:35.440 --> 57:39.120
and in other detention centers
in North Korea.

57:39.360 --> 57:41.280
I think the intelligent person will
see

57:41.760 --> 57:45.480
that all the propaganda
against the DPRK,

57:45.880 --> 57:49.360
all the horror stories
of the concentration camps,

57:49.600 --> 57:51.560
and public executions

57:52.040 --> 57:53.320
have no evidence at all.

57:53.640 --> 57:55.240
And even now,

57:55.440 --> 57:58.840
who used to be the most
representative defectors

57:58.920 --> 57:59.920
of North Korea

58:00.320 --> 58:02.920
are withdrawing their stories.

58:03.480 --> 58:06.280
-It was a symbol of North
Korea's human rights abuses,

58:06.440 --> 58:10.320
but the defector now admits
not everything was true.

58:10.480 --> 58:13.200
-I'm sure there may be
somebody who may have

58:13.360 --> 58:14.680
embellished their story.

58:14.840 --> 58:18.120
But I know there's a lot
of self-policing among the
defectors.

58:18.280 --> 58:21.360
Because they know, they know
that the only way this issue

58:21.440 --> 58:23.880
is either going to get the attention
is they are credible.

58:24.240 --> 58:27.440
We wanted to live as humans.

58:30.480 --> 58:36.160
None of our investigations
have been disqualified as false.

58:36.320 --> 58:39.400
We have been criticized
as an organization.

58:39.600 --> 58:41.560
You can find in so many reports,

58:41.760 --> 58:43.240
even in their official budget,

58:43.400 --> 58:46.240
that they are receiving so much
money from governments,

58:46.520 --> 58:48.040
which they are supposed
not to do.

58:48.200 --> 58:50.520
-North Korea says
that universal human

58:50.680 --> 58:52.080
rights is propaganda.

58:52.920 --> 58:54.320
What they call human rights

58:54.680 --> 58:57.400
is the globalization of capitalism.

58:57.680 --> 58:59.760
These organizations are used

59:00.120 --> 59:01.840
to infiltrate other countries

59:02.000 --> 59:04.280
to impose the American way of life

59:04.440 --> 59:06.040
and the American politics.

59:06.280 --> 59:07.600
What they call human rights

59:07.760 --> 59:10.080
is not the human right
to have shelter,

59:10.240 --> 59:12.080
to have food
to have water,

59:12.240 --> 59:14.000
to have education;
it's not that.

59:14.160 --> 59:16.280
Because USA is the first country

59:16.880 --> 59:19.520
that never accomplishes
that kind of human rights.

59:19.680 --> 59:23.920
-If you call that propaganda,
I call it universal human rights.

59:24.480 --> 59:27.640
Ideally, if the North Korean
government had nothing to hide,

59:28.360 --> 59:30.960
they should allow the entrance
of international agencies.

59:31.680 --> 59:32.720
That's the point.

59:33.680 --> 59:36.120
You will never open
the door to your house

59:36.400 --> 59:39.120
to a person who has been
insulting your father,

59:39.640 --> 59:40.520
insulting you

59:40.880 --> 59:42.000
and threatening you,

59:42.360 --> 59:43.360
and sanctioning you.

59:43.800 --> 59:45.400
If you don't know something,

59:45.560 --> 59:47.520
if for you the DPRK
is a black hole,

59:47.680 --> 59:50.600
you say: "I don't know
anything about DPRK.

59:50.760 --> 59:52.480
It's such a misterious country.

59:52.640 --> 59:55.320
It's a secret country."
Ok! That's fine! It's true!

59:55.760 --> 59:57.640
It's a secret country
you can say that.

59:57.840 --> 59:58.680
It's a fortress.

59:58.840 --> 1:00:00.840
We are very much
protecting our system.

1:00:01.800 --> 1:00:03.960
Tell me the lie

1:00:04.280 --> 1:00:05.840
that angers you the most.

1:00:06.360 --> 1:00:09.880
The lie that angers me the most
will be probably

1:00:11.440 --> 1:00:15.160
that our Korean people
my comrades,

1:00:15.400 --> 1:00:17.680
they are forced
to believe in our system.

1:00:18.080 --> 1:00:19.240
Like there was someone,

1:00:19.680 --> 1:00:24.560
one soldier with one machine gun
pointing at each one of our
citizens,

1:00:25.240 --> 1:00:27.840
to force them
to follow our system.

1:00:28.040 --> 1:00:30.600
(Music)

1:00:38.360 --> 1:00:40.160
The figure of the leader
is the father.

1:00:40.360 --> 1:00:44.680
It's not a dictatorship
like many Western people lie

1:00:44.880 --> 1:00:48.200
and believe in that kind
of missinformation.

1:00:48.480 --> 1:00:51.800
He is, as a father
giving precious instructions

1:00:52.080 --> 1:00:55.000
and giving his life
for the welfare of the people.

1:00:55.200 --> 1:00:57.920
And then the people
also show their love to him

1:00:58.200 --> 1:01:00.320
by accepting him as a father.

1:01:00.560 --> 1:01:03.000
That's why we always
call ourselves family,

1:01:03.160 --> 1:01:05.120
even if we are not
from the same family.

1:01:05.280 --> 1:01:07.760
But being comrades
and having the same leader...

1:01:07.920 --> 1:01:09.760
We help each other,
in everything.

1:01:09.920 --> 1:01:12.320
That's the feeling:
a big community.

1:01:14.720 --> 1:01:16.320
Do the people in North Korea

1:01:16.720 --> 1:01:18.440
have the same feeling

1:01:18.880 --> 1:01:22.360
for the leader Kim Il-sung
as for the others?

1:01:23.160 --> 1:01:25.040
We've never thought

1:01:25.640 --> 1:01:28.200
our President Kim Il-sung
did much more

1:01:28.480 --> 1:01:30.640
and General Kim Jong-il did little.

1:01:30.920 --> 1:01:35.480
No, all things are the same
all achievements are great,

1:01:35.760 --> 1:01:42.240
and the way he did
is the way the General did

1:01:42.760 --> 1:01:46.040
and is the way that
Marshal Kim Jong-un is doing.

1:01:46.480 --> 1:01:49.360
So, for Marshal Kim Jong-un
you have the same love as...

1:01:49.880 --> 1:01:53.080
Yes, we have the same love
because we...

1:01:54.440 --> 1:01:57.840
just lost our beloved fathers...,

1:01:58.880 --> 1:02:02.760
so, we even love them
with more passion...

1:02:05.080 --> 1:02:09.400
Just thinking of our fathers
you know, it's just...

1:02:10.640 --> 1:02:12.920
Later I can explain it.

1:02:14.240 --> 1:02:16.960
-Tonight an 11-day period
of mourning is underway

1:02:17.120 --> 1:02:19.960
for Kim Jong-il,
the dictator who died Saturday.

1:02:20.120 --> 1:02:23.600
And we were struck by images
from inside the Hermit Kingdom

1:02:23.760 --> 1:02:26.440
showing grief-stricken
North Koreans in despair,

1:02:26.600 --> 1:02:28.040
wailing uncontrollably.

1:02:28.200 --> 1:02:31.320
But is all that emotion real
or is there a bit of both?

1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:36.240
He is just like a father taking
care,

1:02:36.400 --> 1:02:39.640
but not just taking care of a son
he takes care of all society.

1:02:39.880 --> 1:02:42.400
He kind of adopted
the whole society.

1:02:46.040 --> 1:02:50.600
God cannot die.

1:02:51.000 --> 1:02:54.640
Nobody believed it when we were told
the person we considered God

1:02:55.560 --> 1:02:57.840
had died.

1:02:58.520 --> 1:03:00.320
I could not accept it as truth.

1:03:01.160 --> 1:03:06.760
It was very emotional
for the people, everyone was crying.

1:03:08.040 --> 1:03:10.160
I cried a lot.

1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:13.000
It affected me a lot.

1:03:17.640 --> 1:03:19.920
That's why all the people
cry on the streets.

1:03:20.200 --> 1:03:20.920
How can it be?

1:03:21.240 --> 1:03:22.640
People cannot understand,

1:03:23.040 --> 1:03:24.960
Is it a theatre?
It's not a theatre.

1:03:25.600 --> 1:03:26.960
This is an insult.

1:03:27.560 --> 1:03:30.840
And when you live so far away,
and the culture is so different,

1:03:31.280 --> 1:03:33.720
for Western people
it will be hard to understand.

1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:38.440
But you cannot really try
to feel the same

1:03:38.600 --> 1:03:39.960
that Korean people feel

1:03:40.400 --> 1:03:42.760
but you can
by talking to the people,

1:03:43.040 --> 1:03:44.680
see that it's a true feeling.

1:03:46.080 --> 1:03:47.400
We haven't really gotten

1:03:47.680 --> 1:03:51.720
any deep knowledge or understanding
of the philosophy or the ideology.

1:03:51.880 --> 1:03:54.200
We get a lot of information
from Alejandro,

1:03:54.360 --> 1:03:56.800
very deep thoughts
and very clear theories,

1:03:57.000 --> 1:03:58.920
of eveything that lies behind it,

1:03:59.080 --> 1:04:01.680
but no North Korean
will tell us anything about it.

1:04:01.840 --> 1:04:03.920
So we have to rely
on what Alejandro is telling us,

1:04:04.080 --> 1:04:06.480
and at the end
he is not really a North Korean,

1:04:06.640 --> 1:04:09.120
even though he has been
coming and going

1:04:09.640 --> 1:04:12.040
with foreign visitors
for the last 20 years,

1:04:12.200 --> 1:04:14.360
that doesn't make you
a North Korean.

1:04:15.040 --> 1:04:17.680
(Music)

1:04:25.640 --> 1:04:28.400
It became a sort of tradition
or custom,

1:04:28.560 --> 1:04:31.560
to visit every year
this flower festival.

1:04:31.960 --> 1:04:35.000
And you see here
this flower is Kimilsungia

1:04:35.760 --> 1:04:38.840
-This one is Kimilsungia?
-Yes. You didn't know?

1:04:39.400 --> 1:04:42.440
Look around the whole festival.

1:04:42.960 --> 1:04:45.320
This flower is called after his
name.

1:04:45.840 --> 1:04:47.960
It's cultivated in Indonesia.

1:04:48.320 --> 1:04:50.120
And the Indonesian president
Sukarno,

1:04:50.480 --> 1:04:53.000
he asked our President
Kim Il-sung

1:04:53.160 --> 1:04:55.440
to name this flower
after his name

1:04:56.320 --> 1:05:00.600
as a sign of respect towards
our Generalissimo Kim Il-sung.

1:05:03.600 --> 1:05:06.320
Why wouldn't we be happy today?

1:05:07.000 --> 1:05:09.360
Our country
and all the citizens of the world

1:05:09.600 --> 1:05:12.520
are celebrating our Great Leader.

1:05:21.040 --> 1:05:24.160
One has to understand
the North Korean system

1:05:24.360 --> 1:05:30.280
and its propaganda are based
on a strong epic national history.

1:05:30.720 --> 1:05:34.840
Its foundation is real
and incredibly strong.

1:05:35.200 --> 1:05:35.960
A leader,

1:05:36.240 --> 1:05:41.200
especially a kind of absolute leader
in a monarchy,

1:05:41.560 --> 1:05:43.240
is usually seen

1:05:43.720 --> 1:05:44.760
as a god.

1:05:44.920 --> 1:05:48.680
Ideology has always been,
in communist countries,

1:05:48.840 --> 1:05:50.320
a substitute for religion.

1:05:50.480 --> 1:05:53.200
-They've taken a lot of imagery
from the New Testament.

1:05:53.360 --> 1:05:54.960
I think it's part of the reason

1:05:55.120 --> 1:05:57.480
that Christianity
is such a taboo in North Korea.

1:05:57.640 --> 1:06:01.040
They have their stars
when Kim Jong-il was born

1:06:01.200 --> 1:06:04.560
and double rainbows
and all of this.

1:06:04.720 --> 1:06:06.680
It's kind of a rip-off of the bible.

1:06:06.840 --> 1:06:09.360
-Many cultures in Asia
have that tradition.

1:06:09.520 --> 1:06:11.200
It's feudalism, in essence.

1:06:11.360 --> 1:06:17.160
The feudal lords ruled over
the subjects basically.

1:06:17.320 --> 1:06:19.760
And this is a continuation of that.

1:06:22.960 --> 1:06:25.280
Visiting a church was not
on the itinerary,

1:06:25.440 --> 1:06:28.640
but I told them I was a Christian
and wanted to attend mass.

1:06:31.480 --> 1:06:34.040
After plenty of phone calls,
we finally got permission.

1:06:43.680 --> 1:06:47.680
(Congregation singing)

1:07:00.960 --> 1:07:03.040
This idea that people have

1:07:03.360 --> 1:07:06.000
that people are being executed
for being Christians.

1:07:07.840 --> 1:07:09.520
I want to know about this.

1:07:09.640 --> 1:07:11.160
Of course,
you can see it by yourself.

1:07:11.480 --> 1:07:14.040
So, the traditional religions
in North Korea

1:07:14.400 --> 1:07:15.160
are Christian;

1:07:15.400 --> 1:07:17.760
among Christians we have Catholics
like this church;

1:07:18.160 --> 1:07:19.880
we have also Protestant church,

1:07:20.320 --> 1:07:23.240
and then we have Buddishm
which is also an ancient religion,

1:07:23.320 --> 1:07:24.720
and they have their rights;

1:07:25.040 --> 1:07:27.120
and they have the Cheondoism
the Cheondogyo,

1:07:27.320 --> 1:07:30.000
which is traditional
to the Korean culture.

1:07:30.920 --> 1:07:33.480
But our government doesn't allow
new religions

1:07:34.080 --> 1:07:36.200
like Scientology
or Jehovah's Witnesses,

1:07:36.440 --> 1:07:40.760
religions that, in many cases
are politically influenced,

1:07:41.200 --> 1:07:44.440
or carry a heavy weight
in cultural invasion,

1:07:44.720 --> 1:07:46.560
rather than just pure philosophy,

1:07:46.880 --> 1:07:48.360
are not tolerated in the DPRK.

1:07:48.720 --> 1:07:50.080
Inside a state like this,

1:07:50.680 --> 1:07:52.440
competitors are not allowed.

1:07:52.760 --> 1:07:55.000
Any religion that could work there

1:07:55.200 --> 1:07:58.720
should be submitted to the state.

1:07:59.440 --> 1:08:00.720
Therefore,

1:08:00.880 --> 1:08:04.240
if any political idea that differs
from that of the regime

1:08:04.440 --> 1:08:07.440
or any suspicion

1:08:07.760 --> 1:08:10.800
that you are not loyal to the regime
is punished,

1:08:10.960 --> 1:08:13.200
I don't see why religion
should be any different.

1:08:17.440 --> 1:08:19.760
As you know,
freedom of cult dictates

1:08:20.280 --> 1:08:22.200
that beliefs cannot be imposed.

1:08:22.360 --> 1:08:27.720
Everybody has the right and the
freedom to be a believer or not.

1:08:28.640 --> 1:08:32.480
The Westerners
appear to be very virtuous

1:08:32.720 --> 1:08:34.320
however they have malice.

1:08:34.640 --> 1:08:36.760
They think theirs is religion,

1:08:37.200 --> 1:08:39.240
but not ours.

1:08:39.440 --> 1:08:40.600
It's contradictory

1:08:40.680 --> 1:08:43.840
that now they speak about
our religion in this manner.

1:08:44.600 --> 1:08:51.320
After all, they brought
Christianism to North Korea.

1:08:51.560 --> 1:08:53.760
This church

1:08:54.040 --> 1:08:59.400
was built for this purpose with
the blessing of Pope John Paul II.

1:09:04.120 --> 1:09:07.000
Our religions were removed
when the Juche ideology was built.

1:09:08.080 --> 1:09:11.480
But there is a church
in Pyongyang

1:09:11.640 --> 1:09:14.560
where the regime can assure
the other countries

1:09:14.760 --> 1:09:18.440
that we have freedom of religion.

1:09:18.600 --> 1:09:25.000
But it's just propaganda,
for foreigners,

1:09:25.080 --> 1:09:27.800
not a real church.

1:09:29.720 --> 1:09:31.480
Whoy did you not give communion?

1:09:32.760 --> 1:09:34.280
We can give communion

1:09:35.040 --> 1:09:37.320
but today the priest
wasn't available.

1:09:37.480 --> 1:09:40.720
That's why we have celebrated
a mass without Eucharist.

1:09:41.200 --> 1:09:43.320
Because, he's not the priest?

1:09:44.160 --> 1:09:45.960
-It's a lie.
There's no freedom of thought,

1:09:46.120 --> 1:09:48.320
and there's absolutely
no freedom of religion.

1:09:48.400 --> 1:09:50.480
And the fact that they've made
these fake churches

1:09:50.600 --> 1:09:53.520
there to try to give
that illusion... it's a lie.

1:09:53.680 --> 1:09:55.480
And North Koreans that have escaped

1:09:55.640 --> 1:09:58.000
who are Christians
will tell you it is a lie.

1:09:58.160 --> 1:09:59.960
Even though they have these...

1:10:00.120 --> 1:10:02.960
it's just a fake, pretend thing.

1:10:06.160 --> 1:10:08.080
I should have guessed
something was wrong:

1:10:08.240 --> 1:10:10.320
this was the only place
in North Korea

1:10:10.480 --> 1:10:12.640
where people did not wear
the pin of the leader.

1:10:12.800 --> 1:10:15.440
It was also surprising
that everybody sang so well.

1:10:21.000 --> 1:10:23.760
Some of my prisoners
were imprisoned

1:10:23.960 --> 1:10:28.000
because they were opposed
to the Kim Il-sung system

1:10:28.800 --> 1:10:31.040
but a lot of them were imprisoned

1:10:31.240 --> 1:10:34.600
because they interacted
with Christianity,

1:10:34.760 --> 1:10:37.240
or contacted someone
in South Korea.

1:10:37.400 --> 1:10:39.880
Kenneth Bae was sentenced
in April to 15 years in

1:10:40.040 --> 1:10:42.320
a labour camp
for what the regime calls

1:10:42.480 --> 1:10:45.280
'hostile acts to bring down
the government'.

1:10:45.440 --> 1:10:47.680
Wonderful, we have a freedom
of Christianity

1:10:47.840 --> 1:10:51.840
but if you try to bring bibles
to our country you are a criminal.

1:10:53.160 --> 1:10:54.600
Any contradiction do you see?

1:10:54.880 --> 1:10:58.080
There are some people in
Christianity, like in many
religions,

1:10:58.280 --> 1:10:59.120
that are crazy:

1:10:59.560 --> 1:11:01.600
they believe God sent them
for a mission

1:11:02.040 --> 1:11:04.040
and that they can go, you know,

1:11:04.240 --> 1:11:07.400
and evangelize and bring
the word of Jesus,

1:11:07.560 --> 1:11:10.080
according to them,
to all the countries in the world.

1:11:10.840 --> 1:11:12.880
This doesn't sound
like a very smart move.

1:11:13.800 --> 1:11:16.080
Again, we don't care about what
move!

1:11:16.360 --> 1:11:18.200
We don't care about
what USA thinks!

1:11:18.880 --> 1:11:20.640
We continue our revolution.

1:11:20.920 --> 1:11:23.360
When will you understand
that in this country

1:11:23.520 --> 1:11:26.200
we don't care how many sanctions
or how much pressure;

1:11:26.560 --> 1:11:30.000
we don't live for the others
we live for ourselves, okay?

1:11:30.200 --> 1:11:31.160
So, understand that

1:11:31.320 --> 1:11:34.440
no matter how much pressure
no matter how much bad publicity,

1:11:34.760 --> 1:11:36.360
we do as we believe.

1:11:36.520 --> 1:11:38.840
He is a criminal
he entered illegally in the country,

1:11:39.080 --> 1:11:42.560
he tried to undermine our system,
so he was judged and sentenced.

1:11:42.720 --> 1:11:44.760
And now it's his time
to pay that sentence.

1:11:44.920 --> 1:11:46.760
That's why we don't release him.

1:11:46.920 --> 1:11:51.280
That's why no matter
what they offer us,

1:11:51.440 --> 1:11:53.400
we are not going to release that
person.

1:11:55.040 --> 1:11:57.800
-Kenneth Bae and Matthew Todd
Miller, two Americans

1:11:57.960 --> 1:11:59.960
who have held in North Korea,

1:12:00.120 --> 1:12:02.080
stunning news this morning.

1:12:02.240 --> 1:12:05.400
Out of nowhere,
they are coming home.

1:12:06.320 --> 1:12:10.440
So I just want to say thank you all
for supporting me, lifting me up,

1:12:10.680 --> 1:12:11.760
and not forgetting me.

1:12:12.200 --> 1:12:15.520
At the same time also not forgetting
the people of North Korea.

1:12:15.680 --> 1:12:19.280
(Music)

1:12:56.800 --> 1:12:59.760
There are some stores where people
can buy with local currency

1:12:59.920 --> 1:13:02.080
and some stores where
they use hard currency.

1:13:02.240 --> 1:13:03.040
And, this one?

1:13:03.560 --> 1:13:05.520
In this one we use hard currency.

1:13:05.720 --> 1:13:08.200
And how do North Koreans
get hard currency?

1:13:10.480 --> 1:13:11.680
Many ways, for instance,

1:13:11.840 --> 1:13:13.160
we go abroad

1:13:13.320 --> 1:13:15.400
and when we work
in the embassies

1:13:16.680 --> 1:13:20.560
we receive our salaries
in hard currency.

1:13:22.560 --> 1:13:24.520
But it seems that this is more aimed

1:13:24.600 --> 1:13:27.200
for the local people
than for the tourists...

1:13:28.040 --> 1:13:28.760
Why?

1:13:29.520 --> 1:13:31.120
Lots of tourists also visit.

1:13:32.160 --> 1:13:34.960
-Around the time of the collapse

1:13:35.120 --> 1:13:37.720
of the Soviet Block,
North Korea went into something

1:13:37.880 --> 1:13:40.440
of a downward spiral.

1:13:40.600 --> 1:13:43.960
They were getting a lot of aid
from the former Soviet Union.

1:13:46.000 --> 1:13:48.120
Since the collapse of the Soviet
Union

1:13:48.320 --> 1:13:52.280
the trade between
Russia and North Korea

1:13:52.960 --> 1:13:54.000
dramatically reduced.

1:13:54.160 --> 1:13:55.960
-I think the first thing
that happened

1:13:56.120 --> 1:13:59.360
is they ran short of energy,
and a lot of the factories closed.

1:13:59.520 --> 1:14:02.640
And when the factories closed
they had no money

1:14:02.800 --> 1:14:04.600
to buy raw ingredients.

1:14:05.320 --> 1:14:10.200
The socialist economic system
of North Korea collapsed.

1:14:10.440 --> 1:14:13.840
It was a system
wherein the government

1:14:14.040 --> 1:14:16.880
would provide the people
a stipend and food rations

1:14:17.400 --> 1:14:22.040
but when the North Korean economy
fell, it ceased to be sustainable.

1:14:22.360 --> 1:14:25.160
-They got hungry, productivity
went down, down, down,

1:14:25.320 --> 1:14:29.560
and the economy really went
into a death spiral.

1:14:29.720 --> 1:14:32.960
-Very large numbers of people
from the 1990s

1:14:33.120 --> 1:14:37.280
have starved to death
as a result of the inadequacy

1:14:37.440 --> 1:14:41.480
of the response
of the government and authorities

1:14:41.640 --> 1:14:46.400
in North Korea to what they call
'the Arduous March',

1:14:46.560 --> 1:14:49.120
the great famine of the 1990s.

1:14:49.280 --> 1:14:53.440
-People started with
their own ingenuity to find ways

1:14:53.600 --> 1:14:54.640
to make money.

1:14:54.800 --> 1:14:58.120
They started informal markets,
which were mostly illegal,

1:14:58.280 --> 1:15:01.240
but the thing was
they had to feed themselves.

1:15:02.400 --> 1:15:06.080
What about this critic that says

1:15:06.520 --> 1:15:09.800
there is an underground capitalist

1:15:10.080 --> 1:15:12.000
or individually driven economy?

1:15:12.280 --> 1:15:13.240
No, not at all.

1:15:13.400 --> 1:15:15.960
For instance, you can see
many posts in the street

1:15:16.280 --> 1:15:17.840
selling ice cream,
selling water.

1:15:18.040 --> 1:15:21.040
It's a sub-branch
of one of our restaurants,

1:15:21.200 --> 1:15:22.960
under one of our ministries.

1:15:23.160 --> 1:15:25.000
The problem
is that people don't ask.

1:15:25.160 --> 1:15:28.520
They just take the picture
and start to speculate and invent,

1:15:28.720 --> 1:15:31.280
and specially use for propaganda
against the country,

1:15:31.440 --> 1:15:34.880
to try to make us look
like we have a double standard

1:15:35.080 --> 1:15:38.960
that on one hand we say
we are socialist or communist

1:15:39.120 --> 1:15:42.080
but on the other we allow
these kinds of shops in the street

1:15:42.240 --> 1:15:44.840
selling ice cream.
Well, all of them are state-owned.

1:15:45.040 --> 1:15:49.240
-Kim Jong-il said repeatedly
markets breed egotism

1:15:49.400 --> 1:15:53.800
and egotism is
the death of socialism.

1:15:53.960 --> 1:15:55.320
He saw that correctly.

1:15:55.480 --> 1:15:59.040
And when the food situation
improved a little,

1:15:59.200 --> 1:16:01.040
they tried to close the markets.

1:16:01.200 --> 1:16:03.880
But they couldn't close
the markets because

1:16:04.040 --> 1:16:06.200
people had started thinking
for themselves.

1:16:12.880 --> 1:16:15.560
I never saw any signs
of a black market economy

1:16:15.800 --> 1:16:19.480
despite the numerous reports that
claim that the country depends on
it.

1:16:25.280 --> 1:16:28.360
This cooperative farm
was built in the 1950's

1:16:28.760 --> 1:16:35.640
but has been recently restored.

1:16:37.320 --> 1:16:40.960
In all our farms we follow
the Juche principle

1:16:41.120 --> 1:16:46.600
that we must be self-sufficient.

1:16:48.840 --> 1:16:52.480
When Kim Jong-un suddenly
became the leader of the country,

1:16:52.920 --> 1:16:55.360
he was surrounded
by his father's officials,

1:16:55.520 --> 1:16:56.840
who were very old people

1:16:57.000 --> 1:16:59.640
with their ideas of how
the country should be run.

1:17:00.040 --> 1:17:02.480
-The next story
is not for the weak of stomach.

1:17:02.640 --> 1:17:05.240
A Chinese newspaper says
the uncle of North Korean

1:17:05.400 --> 1:17:08.560
leader Kim Jong-un
was eaten alive by a pack

1:17:08.720 --> 1:17:12.560
of ravenous dogs
during his execution last year.

1:17:12.720 --> 1:17:14.960
The paper says
Kim and his brother observed

1:17:15.120 --> 1:17:19.560
the one-hour ordeal,
along with about

1:17:19.720 --> 1:17:21.040
300 other officials.

1:17:21.200 --> 1:17:25.160
-He was executed
in a very... unusual way.

1:17:25.320 --> 1:17:28.040
He was dragged out of the front row

1:17:28.200 --> 1:17:32.520
of the Politburo
and taken off to a show trial

1:17:32.680 --> 1:17:35.960
before a military tribunal.

1:17:36.120 --> 1:17:38.400
Which constantly interrupted
and denounced him,

1:17:38.560 --> 1:17:41.000
and he was dead within four days.

1:17:41.160 --> 1:17:44.480
-The story about Jang Song-thaek
being fed to the dogs

1:17:44.640 --> 1:17:47.960
was actually started
by a Chinese microblogger

1:17:48.120 --> 1:17:50.880
who kind of wrote it as a joke,
and then people

1:17:51.040 --> 1:17:54.000
repeated it and it became...
you know,

1:17:54.160 --> 1:17:57.400
sort of this urban legend
that most people believe.

1:17:57.560 --> 1:18:00.840
There's no evidence that Jang
Song-thaek was fed to the dogs.

1:18:01.000 --> 1:18:05.840
-Well, it's incredible.

1:18:05.920 --> 1:18:08.720
The sad part is

1:18:08.880 --> 1:18:11.440
that many people
found it believable.

1:18:14.000 --> 1:18:18.400
To the outside world the message
is 'I am in charge.

1:18:18.560 --> 1:18:23.640
Don't mistake that anybody else'...

1:18:23.800 --> 1:18:26.800
because for many months before
his execution,

1:18:26.960 --> 1:18:30.560
people thought that he was
the number two in power.

1:18:31.320 --> 1:18:34.360
It was kind of common expectation,

1:18:35.080 --> 1:18:38.040
that in a few years' time,
Kim Jong-un would remove

1:18:38.880 --> 1:18:42.240
dignitaries and top officials
from his father's era,

1:18:42.400 --> 1:18:45.520
and would replace them with young
or at least different people.

1:18:45.960 --> 1:18:47.800
This is exactly what happened.

1:18:47.960 --> 1:18:50.480
Nobody thought that
it would happen so fast

1:18:50.840 --> 1:18:52.920
and in such a dramatic manner.

1:18:53.240 --> 1:18:55.240
Sometimes it's the king
who gets killed,

1:18:55.440 --> 1:18:57.200
but more frequently
it's the regent.

1:18:57.640 --> 1:19:00.640
A wicked political careerist,
trickster and traitor of all ages,

1:19:00.800 --> 1:19:03.440
Jang Song-thaek was condemned

1:19:03.640 --> 1:19:06.640
in the name of the Revolution
and the People.

1:19:07.080 --> 1:19:12.040
Until then, we thought of him
as a patriot,

1:19:12.360 --> 1:19:16.200
as the most loyal person
to our Generalissimo.

1:19:16.600 --> 1:19:20.080
That's why all the Korean people
were shocked

1:19:20.440 --> 1:19:21.320
at this news.

1:19:22.160 --> 1:19:25.160
So we thought that
he would be near our Marshal,

1:19:25.840 --> 1:19:29.440
assist him in many affairs,

1:19:29.720 --> 1:19:35.240
but, it was so sudden for us
to find out his treachery.

1:19:36.040 --> 1:19:39.480
It's not only treachery
to our Generalissimo

1:19:39.640 --> 1:19:41.480
to our Marshal Kim Jong-un,

1:19:41.640 --> 1:19:44.200
it's treachery to the whole
Korean people.

1:19:44.360 --> 1:19:48.160
So that's why we couldn't
be patient about it.

1:19:48.720 --> 1:19:50.400
-Were you angry?
-Yes, of course.

1:19:50.560 --> 1:19:52.120
-Everybody?
-Everybody.

1:19:55.280 --> 1:19:58.600
When we went to the North Korean TV
to get archive footage,

1:19:58.920 --> 1:20:00.640
they told us they needed to erase

1:20:01.040 --> 1:20:03.160
the traitor Jang Song-thaek first.

1:20:03.600 --> 1:20:07.480
(Cheering/Applause)

1:20:08.280 --> 1:20:11.720
Some people have mentioned
that he was corrupted by the
Chinese.

1:20:12.120 --> 1:20:14.000
Have you heard about this?

1:20:14.160 --> 1:20:18.080
-Yeah, I think that's
the indirect accusation.

1:20:18.240 --> 1:20:23.280
-The uncle is believed
to be an advocate

1:20:23.440 --> 1:20:25.560
of Chinese style reform.

1:20:25.720 --> 1:20:30.640
His uncle has been
very instrumental in pursuing

1:20:30.800 --> 1:20:32.880
relations with China,
including trade

1:20:33.040 --> 1:20:34.640
and economic ties with China.

1:20:37.200 --> 1:20:40.640
When Mao died the Chinese Government
made a huge decision,

1:20:41.720 --> 1:20:45.520
they reformed the old system
and tried something new.

1:20:46.920 --> 1:20:48.920
A major feature
of the new system was

1:20:50.040 --> 1:20:54.320
to introduce more market
based mechanism into the old system.

1:20:54.480 --> 1:20:57.080
China gradually realized
that private economy

1:20:57.360 --> 1:20:59.360
is very important for China.

1:20:59.520 --> 1:21:03.640
China also made this reform
that communist society countries

1:21:03.800 --> 1:21:08.120
can allow the private economy
to serve for these countries.

1:21:08.560 --> 1:21:09.800
China changed!

1:21:10.320 --> 1:21:12.160
Mao was betrayed
by their own comrades!

1:21:12.760 --> 1:21:14.680
Stalin was betrayed
by their own comrades!

1:21:15.480 --> 1:21:17.640
Vietnam, a country
that suffered so much

1:21:17.800 --> 1:21:20.280
under U.S. invasion
is now a full capitalist country!

1:21:21.400 --> 1:21:24.400
So, could it happen tomorrow
to North Korea? Yes.

1:21:25.160 --> 1:21:26.240
They are humans also.

1:21:26.800 --> 1:21:29.880
One day, the poison of capitalism
could enter this country,

1:21:30.400 --> 1:21:31.600
in 50 or 100 years.

1:21:32.040 --> 1:21:38.240
(Clicking)

1:21:43.120 --> 1:21:45.520
We are going to ask Alejandro:
how come

1:21:46.680 --> 1:21:50.000
a Coca-Cola
sign got into North Korea?

1:21:50.560 --> 1:21:51.280
Oh, really?

1:21:54.080 --> 1:21:54.880
Oh!

1:21:55.640 --> 1:21:56.480
Yes, yes.

1:21:56.920 --> 1:21:58.320
This has an easy explanation.

1:21:58.600 --> 1:22:02.120
Normally, we don't have enough
fridges by national production,

1:22:02.320 --> 1:22:03.840
so we import them from China.

1:22:04.280 --> 1:22:07.560
And then, from China
it comes already branded like that.

1:22:09.560 --> 1:22:14.600
Someone like that is always useful.
It is such a closed regime,

1:22:15.160 --> 1:22:16.880
that now have found someone

1:22:17.280 --> 1:22:19.880
who facilitates for them
coming in and out.

1:22:20.160 --> 1:22:22.960
Obviously there is money involved,

1:22:23.120 --> 1:22:25.600
he facilitates the entrance
of hard currency...

1:22:26.520 --> 1:22:27.880
We still have many problems.

1:22:28.080 --> 1:22:28.880
We know that.

1:22:29.040 --> 1:22:31.560
We are working on that
I myself play my role,

1:22:31.720 --> 1:22:34.360
to try to improve it
by bringing more foreign investment,

1:22:34.520 --> 1:22:35.800
bringing more technology,

1:22:35.960 --> 1:22:37.760
and teaching our state companies

1:22:37.920 --> 1:22:39.160
how to be more efficient.

1:22:51.080 --> 1:22:52.920
So we are at the University,

1:22:53.280 --> 1:22:54.520
which seems brand new.

1:22:54.800 --> 1:22:57.400
Everything is just
like out of the box.

1:22:58.640 --> 1:23:01.720
And curiously, all of the computers
are Hewlett-Packard.

1:23:03.600 --> 1:23:07.160
-And where did you buy this?
-That's a secret.

1:23:07.720 --> 1:23:08.720
(Laughing)

1:23:09.440 --> 1:23:10.400
That's a secret.

1:23:10.560 --> 1:23:13.640
Otherwise Americans will know
how we go around the blockade.

1:23:14.000 --> 1:23:15.240
The blockade is useless.

1:23:16.160 --> 1:23:18.280
Useless embargo.

1:23:20.760 --> 1:23:22.560
He is a fantastic tool
for propaganda.

1:23:23.120 --> 1:23:26.280
He is a Westerner who goes there,

1:23:26.440 --> 1:23:29.560
who puts on his uniform
with all his medals,

1:23:29.840 --> 1:23:32.160
and he sings to Kim Jong-il,

1:23:32.360 --> 1:23:33.600
he sings to Kim Il-sung,

1:23:34.040 --> 1:23:35.400
And he knows it by heart...

1:23:35.840 --> 1:23:36.880
He's a great asset!

1:23:38.440 --> 1:23:42.720
You know, I have been living during
the times of the Arduous March.

1:23:43.080 --> 1:23:45.000
I came to the Motherland, I know

1:23:45.160 --> 1:23:48.120
what was our situation
back then, in the '90s.

1:23:48.400 --> 1:23:49.360
So hard,

1:23:49.520 --> 1:23:51.080
we didn't have anything.

1:23:51.480 --> 1:23:55.240
But, after witnessing
the transformation of the Republic

1:23:55.480 --> 1:23:57.080
under our Marshal Kim Jong-un,

1:23:57.480 --> 1:23:58.800
I was so surprised.

1:23:59.520 --> 1:24:04.560
These centres, our Republic
are becoming the envy of the world.

1:24:06.320 --> 1:24:08.320
So if we show them in DPRK,

1:24:09.560 --> 1:24:11.000
how is this country,

1:24:11.240 --> 1:24:13.160
they want to live like in DPRK.

1:24:13.960 --> 1:24:16.880
When I go to talk
to the universities, in Spain,

1:24:17.040 --> 1:24:18.640
many times to give a conference,

1:24:19.000 --> 1:24:20.760
more than 500 people,

1:24:20.920 --> 1:24:23.800
600 people come to hear me

1:24:24.000 --> 1:24:24.880
and then I talk.

1:24:25.160 --> 1:24:28.640
Why and how we develop
our socialist system.

1:24:29.200 --> 1:24:32.560
And they become very interested
and followers

1:24:32.960 --> 1:24:34.280
of our great leaders.

1:24:35.040 --> 1:24:37.760
So we could say that DPRK

1:24:38.080 --> 1:24:40.440
is becoming
the centre of the world.

1:24:42.640 --> 1:24:44.200
You are really lucky!

1:24:44.720 --> 1:24:45.720
(Laughing)

1:24:47.000 --> 1:24:49.280
He dresses as Superman,
he acts like Superman,

1:24:49.440 --> 1:24:51.720
he believes he is Superman,
but he isn't.

1:24:51.960 --> 1:24:53.440
That's it. That's Alejandro.

1:24:53.720 --> 1:24:58.640
(Music)

1:25:17.000 --> 1:25:23.960
(Speaking Korean)

1:25:24.120 --> 1:25:26.320
-Today he made it.
-Beautiful.

1:25:26.480 --> 1:25:27.680
-Thank you.

1:25:27.840 --> 1:25:28.960
-Very nice.

1:25:29.120 --> 1:25:31.520
(Music)

1:25:32.320 --> 1:25:34.600
I still have so many questions...

1:25:34.760 --> 1:25:36.880
Who benefits from the status quo?

1:25:37.040 --> 1:25:39.640
What will the future bring
for these people?

1:25:40.360 --> 1:25:42.960
And again
where is the money coming from?

1:25:43.120 --> 1:25:47.520
(Music)

1:26:13.400 --> 1:26:16.600
-People always ask me
why North Korea still exists,

1:26:16.760 --> 1:26:19.960
and I think it exists because
nobody wants it to collapse.

1:26:20.120 --> 1:26:23.000
The Chinese keep it going
because they like

1:26:23.160 --> 1:26:25.920
having a communist ally buffer zone
on their border.

1:26:31.120 --> 1:26:33.600
The Chinese policy
consists of maintaining

1:26:33.760 --> 1:26:38.840
its complicated
North Korean ally alive.

1:26:39.000 --> 1:26:44.080
-Making North Korea reliant
on China helps China keep

1:26:44.240 --> 1:26:47.120
that Korea card in their hands.

1:26:47.280 --> 1:26:51.080
America, you need me
to deal with North Korea.

1:26:51.880 --> 1:26:56.400
China's main priority
is the development of its country

1:26:57.280 --> 1:27:01.800
the last thing they need
is conflict.

1:27:02.280 --> 1:27:05.680
-It's also destabilizing
for China to be worrying

1:27:05.840 --> 1:27:07.920
about a nuclear North Korea.

1:27:08.520 --> 1:27:10.440
The Chinese do not want

1:27:11.000 --> 1:27:12.880
the regime to fall,

1:27:13.080 --> 1:27:17.320
because they don't want to have
American soldiers at their border.

1:27:17.960 --> 1:27:22.960
-I believe that they fear
that having a unified Korea

1:27:23.120 --> 1:27:25.400
will harm China.

1:27:25.560 --> 1:27:26.720
But it won't.

1:27:26.880 --> 1:27:29.200
It will actually be
a benefit to China.

1:27:29.360 --> 1:27:31.200
Because they won't have
to worry about

1:27:31.360 --> 1:27:34.000
this dictatorship that they're
constantly having to bail out,

1:27:34.160 --> 1:27:36.680
that who knows
what Kim Jong-un is going to do.

1:27:36.840 --> 1:27:42.600
So I think the Chinese Government
have lots of frustration

1:27:42.920 --> 1:27:46.440
about what is going on
in North Korea.

1:27:48.320 --> 1:27:53.880
-And, in a way, that's part
of the China-US kind of rivalry

1:27:54.040 --> 1:27:54.800
in the region.

1:27:55.560 --> 1:27:59.680
It's not ready to give this away
we want something in return.

1:28:00.960 --> 1:28:03.440
China is the enemy
of the United States.

1:28:03.600 --> 1:28:06.520
And what the U.S. want is obviously

1:28:06.760 --> 1:28:11.680
to maintain its position in Asia
and that part of the Pacific,

1:28:12.400 --> 1:28:15.640
and not to have
their power contested.

1:28:17.040 --> 1:28:21.920
United States is probably
the only pro-unification country.

1:28:22.240 --> 1:28:26.600
But I would not bet on that
because if the country is unified

1:28:27.320 --> 1:28:29.280
it would be difficult to justify

1:28:29.360 --> 1:28:31.880
the presence
of the U.S. forces in Korea.

1:28:32.280 --> 1:28:38.560
The United States
can continue to sell weapons

1:28:38.640 --> 1:28:42.400
to South Korea and to Japan.

1:28:42.720 --> 1:28:45.600
Russia doesn't want a unified Korea,

1:28:46.040 --> 1:28:49.000
which would strengthen
the American position in the region.

1:28:49.320 --> 1:28:51.560
Let's assume a unified Korea
will be essentially

1:28:51.720 --> 1:28:53.480
an enlarged version of South Korea.

1:28:53.640 --> 1:28:56.440
-The Japanese keep it going
because they are afraid

1:28:56.600 --> 1:28:59.040
of the economic and military power
of a united Korea.

1:28:59.200 --> 1:29:01.280
South Korea doesn't want unification

1:29:01.600 --> 1:29:03.360
because they'll have to pay for it.

1:29:04.040 --> 1:29:08.080
And it's going to be absolutely,
unbelievably expensive.

1:29:08.240 --> 1:29:10.240
-If the North Korean regime
collapses,

1:29:10.320 --> 1:29:12.960
you're talking about the billions
of dollars it's going to cost

1:29:13.040 --> 1:29:14.120
the South Korean economy.

1:29:14.280 --> 1:29:16.080
And it kind of scares South Koreans.

1:29:16.160 --> 1:29:18.040
But the longer they're separated,
the longer

1:29:18.160 --> 1:29:20.840
this continues, the greater
that cost is going to be.

1:29:21.520 --> 1:29:23.520
Of all the major international
players,

1:29:24.400 --> 1:29:26.920
the majority wants status quo.

1:29:27.080 --> 1:29:29.160
-I think the only ones
who really want it

1:29:29.320 --> 1:29:31.560
to collapse
are the North Korean people.

1:29:31.720 --> 1:29:33.200
They do want it to collapse.

1:29:33.360 --> 1:29:35.440
But they don't have much say
in the matter.

1:29:37.760 --> 1:29:41.800
-You're talking here about
23 million people

1:29:41.960 --> 1:29:45.920
who are suffering
and have suffered for 65 years

1:29:46.080 --> 1:29:50.040
and more grievous crimes
against humanity.

1:29:52.480 --> 1:29:54.920
The victims of the status quo
are the vast majority

1:29:55.000 --> 1:29:56.000
of the North Koreans

1:29:56.240 --> 1:29:58.320
however who does care about them?

1:29:58.520 --> 1:29:59.560
Nobody.

1:29:59.920 --> 1:30:03.440
(Music)

1:30:04.240 --> 1:30:06.560
Propaganda serves
as a diversion from the truth,

1:30:07.080 --> 1:30:10.040
we are all victims of propaganda.
The Governments and the Media

1:30:10.200 --> 1:30:12.400
are constantly submitting us
to manipulation

1:30:12.560 --> 1:30:14.960
and the only tool
we have against it is information.

1:30:20.560 --> 1:30:21.520
But the truth is...

1:30:23.120 --> 1:30:26.280
It's hard to tell what is the truth,
and I don't think we'll ever know.

1:30:26.440 --> 1:30:29.160
But whether we like it or not,
whether we know it or not,

1:30:29.320 --> 1:30:30.720
we are all part of the game.

1:30:38.720 --> 1:30:41.520
North Korea is indescribable

1:30:43.360 --> 1:30:45.560
no humans deserve to be oppressed

1:30:46.000 --> 1:30:48.440
just because of their birthplace.

1:30:50.560 --> 1:30:53.280
We need to focus less on the regime

1:30:53.600 --> 1:30:56.080
and more on the people
who are being forgotten.

1:30:58.200 --> 1:30:59.360
One Young World,

1:30:59.720 --> 1:31:02.840
we are the ones
who will make them visible.

1:31:04.040 --> 1:31:08.520
