WEBVTT

00:01.167 --> 00:03.433
- WHEN ARE WE GOING
TO GET THERE?

00:03.433 --> 00:05.067
- I TOLD YOU
TO GO BEFORE WE LEAVE.

00:05.067 --> 00:08.233
STOP KICKING THE BACK
OF MY SEAT!

00:08.233 --> 00:09.967
- IGNORE HIM.

00:09.967 --> 00:12.333
HE JUST DOESN'T
LIKE WEDDINGS.

00:12.333 --> 00:16.700
- I HAD A BAD EXPERIENCE ONCE.

00:16.700 --> 00:19.533
- WELL, I'M LOOKING FORWARD
TO SEEING OUR OLD NEIGHBORS:

00:19.533 --> 00:21.867
THE STEADMANS
AND THE GARINIS

00:21.867 --> 00:23.967
AND THE DI VINCENZOS.

00:23.967 --> 00:26.233
- WHICH ONES
WERE THEY AGAIN?

00:26.233 --> 00:27.900
- YOU KICKED
IN THEIR HALLOWEEN PUMPKIN

00:27.900 --> 00:31.567
'CAUSE YOU THOUGHT IT WAS
A CARICATURE OF YOU.

00:31.567 --> 00:33.333
- OH, YEAH.

00:33.333 --> 00:35.400
- WAIT A MINUTE, MA, THE GARINIS
ARE GOING TO BE THERE?

00:35.400 --> 00:37.400
- MM-HMM.
- OH, GOD.

00:37.400 --> 00:40.267
- WHAT'S WRONG THERE,
CUBBY?

00:40.267 --> 00:41.800
- UH, FORGET IT.
NOTHING. IT'S STUPID.

00:41.800 --> 00:44.800
- I'M SURE IT IS.
LET'S HEAR IT.

00:44.800 --> 00:46.467
- I KNOW WHAT IT'S ABOUT.

00:46.467 --> 00:48.633
RAYMOND AND ELIZABETH GARINI
HAD A THING

00:48.633 --> 00:50.200
BACK IN HIGH SCHOOL.

00:50.200 --> 00:52.600
- OH, REALLY?

00:52.600 --> 00:55.367
- IT WASN'T A THING.
IT WAS ONE DATE.

00:55.367 --> 00:57.033
- WELL, IT COULD HAVE BEEN
A THING.

00:57.033 --> 00:59.567
ELIZABETH HAD
A BIG CRUSH ON YOU,

00:59.567 --> 01:03.667
BUT YOU WERE SO PICKY...
BACK THEN.

01:11.567 --> 01:14.767
- SO TELL ME
ABOUT THIS GIRL, RAY.

01:14.767 --> 01:16.567
- SHE WENT
TO A DIFFERENT HIGH SCHOOL,

01:16.567 --> 01:18.800
AND THEY WERE HAVING
THEIR WINTER DANCE THING.

01:18.800 --> 01:21.233
- AND I HEARD THAT ELIZABETH
THOUGHT HE WAS CUTE

01:21.233 --> 01:23.800
AND WANTED
TO INVITE HIM.

01:23.800 --> 01:26.333
- WAS SHE
THE BLIND GIRL?

01:26.333 --> 01:28.067
- HEY, HOW WOULD YOU KNOW,
HUH?

01:28.067 --> 01:30.067
YOU WERE HOME
IN YOUR FOOTSIE PAJAMAS

01:30.067 --> 01:33.467
ASKING MOM
FOR MORE PUDDING.

01:33.467 --> 01:35.400
I JUST REMEMBER MOM SAYING,

01:35.400 --> 01:37.067
"IF ELIZABETH GARINI
ASKS YOU,

01:37.067 --> 01:39.367
YOU SHOULD GO;
IT'LL BE FUN."

01:39.367 --> 01:45.200
- OH, SO YOUR MOM
WAS PIMPING FOR YOU.

01:45.200 --> 01:48.433
- I DON'T LIKE THAT,
DEBRA.

01:48.433 --> 01:50.567
- SO ELIZABETH CALLS ME AND--
AND ASKS ME,

01:50.567 --> 01:52.333
AND, YOU KNOW,
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?

01:52.333 --> 01:57.167
I KIND OF FEEL SORRY FOR HER,
SO I-I SAY YES.

01:57.167 --> 01:59.400
THEN WHEN WE WERE
AT THE DANCE,

01:59.400 --> 02:01.700
IT STARTED TO SNOW,
AND I HAD DAD'S CAR.

02:01.700 --> 02:03.533
I DIDN'T WANT ANYTHING
TO HAPPEN TO IT.

02:03.533 --> 02:06.067
- DAMN STRAIGHT.

02:06.067 --> 02:09.167
- SO WE GET TO HER HOUSE,
AND I--

02:09.167 --> 02:11.200
- WHAT? WHAT DID YOU DO
TO THE CAR?

02:11.200 --> 02:12.333
- NOTHING, DAD.

02:12.333 --> 02:14.700
- TELL ME NOW.
STOP THE LIES!

02:14.700 --> 02:17.867
- NOTHING HAPPENED
TO THE CAR, OKAY?

02:17.867 --> 02:20.067
WE WERE STOPPED IN FRONT
OF HER PARENTS' HOUSE,

02:20.067 --> 02:22.567
AND SHE WAS SAYING
SHE HAD A NICE TIME

02:22.567 --> 02:25.300
AND ALL THAT,
BUT ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT

02:25.300 --> 02:27.167
IS GETTING THE CAR
BACK TO THE MANIAC HERE.

02:27.167 --> 02:29.900
- DAMN STRAIGHT.

02:29.900 --> 02:31.267
- SO WE'RE JUST
SITTING THERE,

02:31.267 --> 02:34.600
AND THEN FINALLY
ELIZABETH SAYS,

02:34.600 --> 02:37.067
"OKAY, BYE."

02:37.067 --> 02:40.333
AND SHE GETS OUT
AND WALKS TO HER DOOR

02:40.333 --> 02:45.133
IN THE SNOW
BY HERSELF.

02:45.133 --> 02:49.700
I DIDN'T WALK HER
TO THE DOOR.

02:49.700 --> 02:52.800
THERE SHE WAS.

02:52.800 --> 02:54.667
ALL BY HERSELF,

02:54.667 --> 02:56.467
FANCY DRESS,

02:56.467 --> 02:58.767
HIGH HEELS,

02:58.767 --> 03:02.100
WOBBLING
UP THE DRIVEWAY.

03:02.100 --> 03:05.067
- SO DID YOU CALL HER
AND APOLOGIZE?

03:05.067 --> 03:08.833
- I WANTED TO,
BUT THEN I DIDN'T,

03:08.833 --> 03:10.867
AND I KEPT PUTTING IT OFF,

03:10.867 --> 03:11.967
AND THEN A FEW DAYS LATER,

03:11.967 --> 03:14.600
IT WAS TOO LATE,
SO I JUST--

03:14.600 --> 03:16.800
I NEVER TALKED
TO HER AGAIN.

03:16.800 --> 03:20.133
- YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN
SO GOOD TOGETHER.

03:23.467 --> 03:26.500
OOH, THIS PLACE
IS BEAUTIFUL.

03:26.500 --> 03:27.900
- YEAH, YEAH.

03:27.900 --> 03:29.200
WHERE THE HELL'S
OUR TABLE?

03:29.200 --> 03:31.067
- I DON'T KNOW.
LET'S SEE.

03:31.067 --> 03:33.667
I'LL LOOK FOR IT.
19 ANYWHERE?

03:33.667 --> 03:35.067
- I DON'T SEE HER.

03:35.067 --> 03:36.467
I DON'T THINK SHE CAME.

03:36.467 --> 03:38.133
YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T
SEE HER AT THE CHURCH.

03:38.133 --> 03:39.567
- THAT'S 'CAUSE YOU
WERE HIDING.

03:39.567 --> 03:44.233
- I WASN'T HIDING.
I WAS DEEP IN PRAYER.

03:44.233 --> 03:45.467
- WHOA, WHOA,
IS THAT HER?

03:45.467 --> 03:47.333
- WHO? WHERE?
- UH, WAIT, NO.

03:47.333 --> 03:49.067
IT'S AN OLD MAN
WITH A WALKER.

03:49.067 --> 03:53.833
SORRY.
MY MISTAKE.

03:53.833 --> 03:55.933
- YOU LOVE THIS,
DON'T YOU?

03:55.933 --> 03:58.300
- I'M AFRAID I DO, YES.

03:58.300 --> 03:59.800
- JUST SO YOU KNOW,
THERE'S A PART OF ME

03:59.800 --> 04:02.633
THAT THINKS IT WOULD
BE GOOD IF SHE WAS HERE.

04:02.633 --> 04:05.167
YEAH, JUST
FACE THIS THING HEAD-ON.

04:05.167 --> 04:06.933
OKAY? HOW ABOUT THAT?

04:06.933 --> 04:09.100
- THERE SHE IS!

04:09.100 --> 04:13.300
UH, NOPE, SORRY,
THAT'S A POACHED SALMON.

04:13.300 --> 04:14.900
OH, HEY, LOOK,
THERE'S OUR TABLE.

04:14.900 --> 04:16.100
- OH.

04:16.100 --> 04:17.933
MARIE, FRANK,
WE'RE OVER HERE.

04:17.933 --> 04:19.767
- OH, OKAY.

04:19.767 --> 04:21.767
- HEY, THERE, TABLEMATES.
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

04:21.767 --> 04:24.867
I'M HARRY ARMON.
THIS IS MY WIFE MARCI.

04:24.867 --> 04:27.733
- WHAT ARE YOU
SO HAPPY ABOUT?

04:27.733 --> 04:31.500
DON'T YOU SEE THIS TABLE
PLACEMENT IS AN INSULT?

04:31.500 --> 04:33.400
THEY STUCK US IN THE CORNER
BY THE KITCHEN.

04:33.400 --> 04:35.200
- COME ON.
IT'S FINE, FRANK.

04:35.200 --> 04:36.533
- NO, IT'S NOT FINE.

04:36.533 --> 04:39.800
WE'RE AT TABLE 19
OUT OF 20 TABLES,

04:39.800 --> 04:41.133
AND TABLE 20 IS FILLED

04:41.133 --> 04:45.167
WITH EMBARRASSING
FAMILY NUT JOBS.

04:45.167 --> 04:47.333
NO OFFENSE.

04:49.067 --> 04:52.333
- SO THREE COUPLES
AND ME.

04:52.333 --> 04:55.067
ON THIS JOYOUS DAY
OF LOVE AND TOGETHERNESS,

04:55.067 --> 04:58.667
THE CHEESE STANDS ALONE.

04:58.667 --> 05:01.933
- YOU'RE NOT ALONE.
YOU HAVE US.

05:01.933 --> 05:04.200
- SUPER.

05:04.200 --> 05:05.633
- HEY, ROBERT,
DON'T LOOK NOW.

05:05.633 --> 05:07.400
I THINK THAT WOMAN'S
GIVING YOU THE EYE.

05:07.400 --> 05:10.533
OH, NO,
IT'S THE FINGER, SORRY.

05:23.567 --> 05:26.700
- YOU ARE
A TEENY-WEENY MAN.

05:28.233 --> 05:30.500
- HEY, RAY, LET'S DANCE.

05:30.500 --> 05:31.967
- NO, NO, COME ON.
WE JUST GOT HERE.

05:31.967 --> 05:33.500
- NO, COME ON. ONE SONG.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.200
- I CAN'T DANCE.
I DIDN'T EAT; I'LL FAINT.

05:35.200 --> 05:36.667
- YOU DANCED
WITH THAT ELIZABETH.

05:36.667 --> 05:37.633
YOU CAN DANCE WITH ME.

05:37.633 --> 05:39.433
- OH, COME ON.
- LET'S GO.

05:39.433 --> 05:41.067
- MY FATHER'S GOING
TO EAT YOUR SALAD.

05:41.067 --> 05:42.767
- ALL RIGHT.

05:48.733 --> 05:51.500
- YOU GOT, LIKE,
A FUZZY IN YOUR HAIR.

05:51.500 --> 05:54.133
- MM.

05:54.133 --> 05:55.500
- YOU GOT
A WHOLE BUNCH OF THEM.

05:55.500 --> 05:58.967
- WOULD YOU PLEASE,
PLEASE STOP GROOMING ME?

05:58.967 --> 06:00.933
- OKAY.

06:00.933 --> 06:02.667
SORRY I CARE ABOUT YOU.

06:02.667 --> 06:04.467
- RAYMOND?

06:04.467 --> 06:07.700
HI, IT'S ELIZABETH...
GARINI.

06:07.700 --> 06:11.600
- ELIZABETH GA-WHO?

06:11.600 --> 06:14.733
- GARINI,
FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

06:14.733 --> 06:18.233
- OH, YES, YEAH, HI.
HI, NICE TO SEE YOU.

06:18.233 --> 06:20.967
OKAY. TAKE CARE.

06:20.967 --> 06:23.200
- HI, I'M DEBRA,
RAY'S WIFE.

06:23.200 --> 06:25.967
- NICE TO MEET YOU.
THIS IS MY HUSBAND SCOTT.

06:25.967 --> 06:29.233
- HEY, HOW YA DOING?
- OKAY. YEAH.

06:29.233 --> 06:32.200
ALL RIGHT, WELL, GOOD-BYE.
ALL RIGHT.

06:32.200 --> 06:35.133
- GOOD TO SEE YOU. HAVE FUN.
- OKAY.

06:35.133 --> 06:37.467
- OH, VERY SMOOTH, RAY.

06:37.467 --> 06:38.967
- IT'S JUST--
I DON'T--

06:38.967 --> 06:41.067
IT WAS A SHOCK
TO SEE HER.

06:41.067 --> 06:43.267
- YEAH, WELL,
SHE WAS REALLY BROKEN UP

06:43.267 --> 06:46.967
ABOUT YOU NOT WALKING HER
TO THE DOOR.

06:46.967 --> 06:48.567
- SERIOUSLY?
DID YOU PICK UP ON THAT?

06:48.567 --> 06:51.100
COME ON,
DON'T JOKE AROUND!

06:51.100 --> 06:52.967
- HONEY, SHE WAS FINE.

06:52.967 --> 06:56.233
SHE CAME UP TO YOU.
YOU CAN STOP OBSESSING NOW.

06:56.233 --> 06:57.500
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

06:57.500 --> 06:58.933
YOU'RE RIGHT.
SHE CAME UP TO ME.

06:58.933 --> 07:01.467
OKAY. GOOD.

07:03.400 --> 07:04.667
- WHAT?

07:04.667 --> 07:06.633
- I FEEL LIKE I SHOULD HAVE
BROUGHT UP THE INCIDENT

07:06.633 --> 07:08.800
AND APOLOGIZED.
- ALL RIGHT, SO DO IT.

07:08.800 --> 07:11.067
- REALLY? NO.
YEAH? NO.

07:11.067 --> 07:12.867
- RAY, YOU ARE SO ANNOYING!

07:12.867 --> 07:15.133
- NO, LOOK, I HAVEN'T HAD TIME
TO PREPARE MY REMARKS.

07:15.133 --> 07:17.467
- YOU'VE HAD 25 YEARS FOR THAT.
HI AGAIN.

07:17.467 --> 07:19.400
- WE'VE GOT TO STOP
MEETING LIKE THIS.

07:19.400 --> 07:21.567
- [laughs]
- OKAY.

07:30.067 --> 07:31.600
YOU KNOW WHAT?

07:31.600 --> 07:33.533
I'LL BET YOU PROBABLY
DON'T EVEN REMEMBER THIS.

07:33.533 --> 07:35.300
WE WENT OUT ONE TIME
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

07:35.300 --> 07:38.167
- OF COURSE. I REMEMBER.
- YEAH?

07:38.167 --> 07:41.733
HEY, DON'T WORRY, MAN.
NOTHING HAPPENED.

07:41.733 --> 07:44.700
- THAT MUST HAVE BEEN,
LIKE, 25 YEARS AGO.

07:44.700 --> 07:46.200
- YEAH, I THINK IT WAS.

07:46.200 --> 07:48.700
I THINK--I THINK
IT WAS SNOWING BACK THEN.

07:48.700 --> 07:51.200
IT WAS, IT WAS SNOWING
'CAUSE I REMEMBER

07:51.200 --> 07:53.767
I WAS NERVOUS
ABOUT THE CAR,

07:53.767 --> 07:57.067
AND SOMETHING--
THERE WAS--WHAT HAPPENED?

07:57.067 --> 08:00.133
SOMEBODY
DIDN'T WALK SOMEBODY--

08:03.600 --> 08:07.867
I THINK I DIDN'T WALK YOU
TO YOUR DOOR, YEAH.

08:07.867 --> 08:10.567
BECAUSE I WAS NERVOUS
ABOUT THE CAR AND THE SNOW.

08:10.567 --> 08:13.233
RIGHT? I REMEMBER,
BUT THAT'S NO EXCUSE.

08:13.233 --> 08:15.400
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I SHOULD APOLOGIZE FOR THAT.

08:15.400 --> 08:18.500
I WAS A STUPID KID
WITH THE SNOW.

08:18.500 --> 08:21.067
SO LISTEN,

08:21.067 --> 08:24.867
I'M SORRY FOR THAT.

08:24.867 --> 08:28.067
- WOW.

08:28.067 --> 08:32.200
I DON'T REALLY
REMEMBER THAT, BUT...

08:35.500 --> 08:38.467
IT'S SO SWEET OF YOU
TO APOLOGIZE.

08:38.467 --> 08:40.067
GOSH, I HOPE
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN WAITING

08:40.067 --> 08:41.500
SINCE HIGH SCHOOL
TO TELL ME THAT.

08:41.500 --> 08:43.667
[laughter]

08:43.667 --> 08:45.767
- NO, NO, NO.

08:45.767 --> 08:47.433
NO, I MEAN,
COULDN'T YOU TELL?

08:47.433 --> 08:50.233
IT WAS ALL COMING BACK
TO ME AS I WAS SAYING IT.

08:50.233 --> 08:53.433
- OH, GEE, WELL, THANKS
FOR BEING SO THOUGHTFUL.

08:53.433 --> 08:57.567
- YEAH, WELL, HEY,
THAT'S ME, MR. THOUGHTFUL.

08:57.567 --> 09:00.733
OKAY.
BYE.

09:00.733 --> 09:04.467
- AND HERE I MISTOOK YOU
FOR MR. POTATO HEAD.

09:04.467 --> 09:07.267
- I-I SAW YOU TALKING
TO ELIZABETH.

09:07.267 --> 09:08.733
- I DID. I DID. I DID.

09:08.733 --> 09:10.833
I APOLOGIZED FOR THE INCIDENT,
AND SHE WAS FINE.

09:10.833 --> 09:12.200
- OH, THAT'S WONDERFUL.

09:12.200 --> 09:17.067
- YEAH, MAYBE THEY CAN
FINALLY WORK THINGS OUT.

09:17.067 --> 09:18.200
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

09:18.200 --> 09:19.800
THAT WASN'T THAT BAD.

09:19.800 --> 09:22.633
I MEAN, SHE'S HAPPY, RIGHT?
SHE'S GOT A HUSBAND.

09:22.633 --> 09:23.733
- OH, YEAH?

09:23.733 --> 09:26.867
ALL THAT HAPPENED IN FRONT
OF HER HUSBAND?

09:26.867 --> 09:29.133
- YEAH. WHAT?

09:29.133 --> 09:31.233
- NOTHING.

09:31.233 --> 09:33.633
- WHAT?
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

09:33.633 --> 09:35.967
THAT MAYBE SHE WAS--
SHE WAS PUTTING ON AN ACT

09:35.967 --> 09:37.667
IN FRONT
OF HER HUSBAND THERE?

09:37.667 --> 09:40.900
- WELL,
I WASN'T SAYING THAT,

09:40.900 --> 09:43.267
BUT THAT'S GOOD.

09:43.267 --> 09:44.733
YOU SHOULD RUN WITH THAT.

09:44.733 --> 09:47.300
- NO, NO, NO, NO, YOU BRING UP
A GOOD POINT HERE.

09:47.300 --> 09:50.067
- OH, WOULD YOU KNOCK IT OFF?
SHE'S FINE.

09:50.067 --> 09:51.633
- I THINK
SHE WAS OVERLY FINE.

09:51.633 --> 09:52.733
- OH, PLEASE.

09:52.733 --> 09:54.733
- NO, NO, COME ON.
THIS WAS A BIG INCIDENT.

09:54.733 --> 09:56.933
- WOULD YOU STOP CALLING IT
"THE INCIDENT"?

09:56.933 --> 09:59.200
IT WASN'T AN INCIDENT.

09:59.200 --> 10:02.900
ALL RIGHT, CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS
WAS AN INCIDENT.

10:02.900 --> 10:04.367
MY GOD,
IF YOU ARE THIS INSANE

10:04.367 --> 10:06.267
ABOUT NOT WALKING A GIRL
TO THE DOOR,

10:06.267 --> 10:08.233
HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT WHAT YOU DO TO ME?

10:08.233 --> 10:09.567
- WHAT?
WHAT DO I DO TO YOU?

10:09.567 --> 10:11.200
- GOD, YOU DO JERKY THINGS
ALL THE TIME,

10:11.200 --> 10:12.500
THINGS YOU SHOULD
REALLY REGRET.

10:12.500 --> 10:13.767
- OH, YEAH, WELL, LIKE WHAT?

10:13.767 --> 10:15.700
- OH, WHERE DO YOU WANT ME
TO START?

10:15.700 --> 10:20.467
- AT THE BEGINNING.

10:20.467 --> 10:22.567
TAKE YOUR TIME.

10:22.567 --> 10:24.733
HOW ABOUT NOT WALKING ME
TO THE CAR

10:24.733 --> 10:26.967
WHEN I WAS IN LABOR
WITH THE TWINS, RAY?

10:26.967 --> 10:28.533
HOW ABOUT THAT INCIDENT?

10:28.533 --> 10:29.967
- I HAD TO MAKE
A SANDWICH, OKAY?

10:29.967 --> 10:33.333
I HATE HOSPITAL FOOD.
- GOD.

10:33.333 --> 10:35.600
HONESTLY,
I-I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU.

10:35.600 --> 10:37.833
- WHY DON'T WE
GO MINGLE, HONEY?

10:37.833 --> 10:40.767
PURSE--
GET YOUR PURSE.

10:53.600 --> 10:55.667
- ALL RIGHT, DON'T BE MAD.
I'M SORRY, OKAY?

10:55.667 --> 10:57.067
- I WANT YOU
TO TELL ME SOMETHING

10:57.067 --> 10:59.500
THAT YOU REGRET
DOING TO ME.

10:59.500 --> 11:00.967
- COME ON.
WE'RE AT A WEDDING.

11:00.967 --> 11:02.733
- SOMETHING
YOU'VE DONE TO ME

11:02.733 --> 11:05.433
THAT MAKES YOU FEEL
AS HORRIBLE AS YOU DO

11:05.433 --> 11:09.167
ABOUT YOUR DATE
FROM 1977.

11:09.167 --> 11:11.200
- UNCLE ROBERT,
COME DANCE WITH US.

11:11.200 --> 11:12.700
- I'LL GO.
- RAY.

11:12.700 --> 11:15.067
- ROBERT, DANCE WITH THEM.
- I WANT TO SEE THIS.

11:15.067 --> 11:17.200
- GO DANCE WITH THE CHILDREN
RIGHT NOW.

11:17.200 --> 11:19.700
- ALL RIGHT!

11:19.700 --> 11:22.633
COME ON, KIDS!

11:38.900 --> 11:41.933
- REGRET, PLEASE?

11:41.933 --> 11:43.300
- OKAY.

11:43.300 --> 11:47.067
ALL RIGHT, I REGRET
NOT LOVING YOU MORE.

11:47.067 --> 11:48.333
YES.

11:48.333 --> 11:50.133
YES, YOU DESERVE
ALL THE LOVE

11:50.133 --> 11:52.567
THAT CAN FIT IN THE OCEAN.

11:52.567 --> 11:55.633
- [laughs]

11:55.633 --> 11:58.100
OH, MAN.

11:58.100 --> 12:00.667
- I THOUGHT
THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL, FRANK.

12:00.667 --> 12:04.533
WHY CAN'T YOU SAY
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

12:04.533 --> 12:06.500
- ALL RIGHT.

12:06.500 --> 12:08.567
[clears throat]

12:08.567 --> 12:11.700
I WOULD LOVE IT
IF YOU WERE IN THE OCEAN.

12:21.167 --> 12:22.867
- I WANT
SOMETHING SPECIFIC,

12:22.867 --> 12:25.067
SOMETHING LIKE WHEN YOU DIDN'T
WALK ME TO THE CAR

12:25.067 --> 12:26.233
WHEN I WAS IN LABOR.

12:26.233 --> 12:27.633
- OKAY, OKAY,
CAN I USE THAT ONE?

12:27.633 --> 12:29.633
- NO.

12:29.633 --> 12:32.267
- I DID IT MORE THAN ONCE.
- NO. COME ON.

12:32.267 --> 12:33.433
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

12:33.433 --> 12:36.733
REGRET, REGRET.
UM, UH--

12:36.733 --> 12:39.233
OKAY, ALL RIGHT,
WHEN WE WERE FIRST MARRIED,

12:39.233 --> 12:41.567
WE WENT TO A PARTY
AT MY EDITOR'S HOUSE,

12:41.567 --> 12:45.067
AND YOU DIDN'T KNOW ANYBODY,
AND YOU WERE KIND OF NERVOUS,

12:45.067 --> 12:48.133
AND LATER AT DINNER,
YOU TOLD A STORY

12:48.133 --> 12:50.667
THAT YOU THOUGHT
WAS GOING TO BE FUNNY,

12:50.667 --> 12:53.700
BUT IT--
NOBODY LAUGHED.

12:53.700 --> 12:57.200
- SO YOU REGRET
THAT I'M A STIFF AT PARTIES?

12:57.200 --> 12:58.700
THANKS.
FEELING BETTER.

12:58.700 --> 13:01.067
- NO.
NO, NO, LISTEN.

13:01.067 --> 13:04.133
THEY DIDN'T LAUGH,
BUT NEITHER DID I.

13:04.133 --> 13:05.700
I SAW THAT
YOU WERE EMBARRASSED,

13:05.700 --> 13:10.533
AND I SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE
FOR YOU, AND I WASN'T.

13:10.533 --> 13:14.100
YEAH, I'VE--
I'VE ALWAYS REGRETTED THAT.

13:14.100 --> 13:15.767
- WOW.

13:15.767 --> 13:19.900
THAT--THAT MUST HAVE BEEN
A LONG TIME AGO.

13:19.900 --> 13:22.233
SUCH A SMALL THING.

13:22.233 --> 13:26.900
- YEAH, WELL,
TELL THAT TO MY CONSCIENCE.

13:26.900 --> 13:28.467
- I'D ASK YOU
WHAT YOU REGRET,

13:28.467 --> 13:30.067
BUT I'D BE AFRAID
YOU'D SAY

13:30.067 --> 13:31.833
YOU REGRET MARRYING ME.

13:31.833 --> 13:33.567
- AW...

13:33.567 --> 13:36.467
NOT ALL THE TIME.

13:40.067 --> 13:43.900
- OKAY, I'M BACK.
I'M BACK.

13:43.900 --> 13:47.100
WHAT, IT'S OVER?

13:47.100 --> 13:51.367
FRICKIN' BUNNY HOP.

13:51.367 --> 13:57.067
- IT'S FUNNY,
TALKING ABOUT REGRETS.

13:57.067 --> 14:00.200
I'VE GOT REGRETS.

14:03.633 --> 14:07.800
PROBABLY TOO MANY REGRETS
TO MENTION.

14:07.800 --> 14:11.067
- OKAY, THEN.

14:11.067 --> 14:12.567
- I-I'VE--

14:12.567 --> 14:14.733
I'VE DONE THINGS THAT I JUST
FEEL TERRIBLE ABOUT

14:14.733 --> 14:16.067
TO ALL OF YOU.

14:16.067 --> 14:19.767
- ALL RIGHT, MA.
- WAIT. LET HER SPEAK.

14:19.767 --> 14:21.967
- LIKE TO YOU, DEBRA.

14:21.967 --> 14:23.600
I'VE ALWAYS REGRETTED

14:23.600 --> 14:25.367
NOT BEING
MORE NURTURING TO YOU

14:25.367 --> 14:28.733
WHEN YOU FIRST STARTED OUT
AS A WIFE AND A MOTHER.

14:28.733 --> 14:30.100
I AM SORRY.

14:30.100 --> 14:32.067
- OH, MARIE.

14:32.067 --> 14:33.400
THAT'S NICE.

14:33.400 --> 14:38.400
- BECAUSE NOW AT THIS POINT,
WHAT CAN I DO?

14:45.967 --> 14:49.200
- IT MUST FEEL GOOD
TO GET THAT OFF YOUR CHEST.

14:49.200 --> 14:53.067
- YEAH, IT DOES FEEL GOOD.

14:53.067 --> 14:54.400
AND--
AND, RAYMOND?

14:54.400 --> 14:55.833
I'VE ALWAYS REGRETTED

14:55.833 --> 15:00.067
NOT TOUGHENING YOU UP
WHEN YOU WERE A BOY.

15:00.067 --> 15:03.267
- I'M TOUGH.

15:03.267 --> 15:06.467
- NO, YOU'RE NOT.

15:08.633 --> 15:10.067
- AND, ROBERT?

15:10.067 --> 15:13.400
- YES?

15:13.400 --> 15:15.367
- ACTUALLY,
I DON'T HAVE ANY REGRETS

15:15.367 --> 15:18.967
ABOUT HOW I RAISED YOU,
DEAR.

15:18.967 --> 15:22.600
- YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING.

15:22.600 --> 15:26.300
- AND, FRANK...

15:26.300 --> 15:29.600
SOME REGRETS SPEAK
FOR THEMSELVES.

15:32.867 --> 15:35.200
- ENOUGH WITH ALL THIS CRAP.

15:35.200 --> 15:37.767
REGRET IS
A WASTE OF TIME.

15:37.767 --> 15:39.600
MY FATHER USED TO BE
WORKING ON THE ROAD

15:39.600 --> 15:40.800
40 WEEKS A YEAR.

15:40.800 --> 15:42.300
WHEN HE'D COME BACK HOME,
YOU THINK

15:42.300 --> 15:44.467
HE HAD TIME FOR REGRETS?

15:44.467 --> 15:46.433
HE'D HAVE A DRINK,
PUNISH ME FOR WHATEVER I DID,

15:46.433 --> 15:50.233
AND THEN HIT THE ROAD AGAIN.

15:50.233 --> 15:51.833
OKAY,
SO WHAT AM I GOING TO DO,

15:51.833 --> 15:53.100
ASK HIM TO QUIT HIS JOB,

15:53.100 --> 15:56.867
SO HE CAN PLAY WITH ME
OR SOMETHING?

15:56.867 --> 15:59.767
- OH, FRANK.

15:59.767 --> 16:01.667
- WHAT?

16:01.667 --> 16:04.667
- YOU NEVER TOLD ME
ANYTHING ABOUT THIS.

16:04.667 --> 16:07.100
SEE, IT'S GOOD TO TALK.

16:07.100 --> 16:08.933
COME ON, OPEN UP TO ME.

16:08.933 --> 16:10.500
I'M HERE FOR YOU.

16:10.500 --> 16:14.167
- OKAY, LOOK, I WAS LYING
ABOUT MY OLD MAN.

16:14.167 --> 16:15.500
HE WAS A JOLLY GUY

16:15.500 --> 16:17.267
WHO GAVE ME PUPPIES
AND CHOCOLATE COINS,

16:17.267 --> 16:22.233
SO, UH, JUST SLIDE
BACK OVER, OKAY?

16:32.667 --> 16:36.800
- MA, ARE YOU SAYING THAT YOU
HAVE NO REGRETS ABOUT ME?

16:36.800 --> 16:39.900
- PLEASE, ROBERT,
NOT EVERYTHING IS ABOUT YOU.

16:39.900 --> 16:42.767
- NOTHING IS ABOUT ME!

16:42.767 --> 16:45.333
NOTHING!

16:45.333 --> 16:47.067
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.
I GOT REGRETS.

16:47.067 --> 16:49.467
OH, BOY,
DO I GOT REGRETS.

16:49.467 --> 16:52.300
- COME ON, ROBBIE,
YOU'RE BRINGING EVERYBODY DOWN.

16:52.300 --> 16:56.267
- EVERYBODY ELSE GOT TO GO.
I'M GOING.

16:56.267 --> 16:58.967
LET'S SEE, REGRETS.

16:58.967 --> 17:02.067
HMM, QUITE A MENU.

17:04.633 --> 17:05.967
WHERE SHALL I START?

17:05.967 --> 17:09.100
- HOW ABOUT THAT HAIRCUT?

17:14.833 --> 17:16.733
- ALL RIGHT.

17:16.733 --> 17:21.300
THERE IS SOMETHING
I ALWAYS FELT BAD ABOUT.

17:21.300 --> 17:23.133
WHEN JOANNE AND I
WERE FIRST GOING OUT,

17:23.133 --> 17:27.167
I TOOK HER TO THIS PARTY
AT MY SERGEANT'S HOUSE.

17:27.167 --> 17:30.300
AND AT DINNER SHE STARTED
TO TELL THIS JOKE,

17:30.300 --> 17:33.233
AND I GUESS SHE THOUGHT
IT WAS PRETTY FUNNY,

17:33.233 --> 17:37.100
BUT NOBODY ELSE DID,
AND NO ONE LAUGHED.

17:37.100 --> 17:39.800
WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN
ONE THING,

17:39.800 --> 17:43.967
BUT I DIDN'T LAUGH EITHER.

17:43.967 --> 17:46.367
SHE JUST SAT THERE,
EMBARRASSED.

17:46.367 --> 17:48.133
I MEAN,
WHAT KIND OF A GUY--

17:48.133 --> 17:50.733
- YOU USED HIS REGRET?

17:53.267 --> 17:55.667
YOU COULDN'T THINK
OF ONE THING ON YOUR OWN,

17:55.667 --> 17:58.333
SO YOU HAD
TO STEAL HIS REGRET?

17:58.333 --> 18:01.933
YOU STOLE HIS REGRET!

18:01.933 --> 18:05.300
- YOU STOLE MY REGRET?

18:05.300 --> 18:07.133
- WELL, I DEFINITELY HAVE
SOMETHING I REGRET

18:07.133 --> 18:11.133
DOING TO YOU NOW,
SODA POP.

18:11.133 --> 18:13.067
OH, COME ON. ALL RIGHT.
LOOK, I'M SORRY.

18:13.067 --> 18:14.333
I'M SORRY. COME ON.

18:14.333 --> 18:15.967
STOP IT.
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY?

18:15.967 --> 18:18.133
- SHE'S ON THE MOVE, CHIEF.

18:20.900 --> 18:22.633
- COME ON.

18:22.633 --> 18:25.100
WOULD YOU STOP IT?
PLEASE STOP.

18:25.100 --> 18:26.700
- I'LL HAVE ANOTHER ONE.
- LISTEN.

18:26.700 --> 18:28.733
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
I COULDN'T THINK OF A REGRET,

18:28.733 --> 18:31.167
BUT IT WAS LIKE A POP QUIZ;
I PANICKED, OKAY?

18:31.167 --> 18:33.100
BUT YOU WIN.
I'M A BAD PERSON.

18:33.100 --> 18:35.067
- HOW DO I WIN?

18:35.067 --> 18:36.200
[glasses clinking]

18:36.200 --> 18:38.333
OH, THEY'RE KISSING.

18:38.333 --> 18:39.767
YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD
MAKE ME HAPPY?

18:39.767 --> 18:43.067
IF YOU RECOGNIZED
A REGRET BEFORE YOU DID IT!

18:43.067 --> 18:44.333
- OH, WHAT,
TIME TRAVEL, HUH?

18:44.333 --> 18:45.667
YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT TIME TRAVEL.

18:45.667 --> 18:47.200
- ALL RIGHT, STOP.
STOP EVERYTHING.

18:47.200 --> 18:48.367
I HAVE ANOTHER REGRET.

18:48.367 --> 18:49.833
- OH, MA,
ENOUGH WITH THE REGRETS!

18:49.833 --> 18:51.600
- NO, NO, NO,
YOU'RE YELLING AT ONE ANOTHER.

18:51.600 --> 18:53.433
AND IT'S ALL MY FAULT.
- IT'S ALL RIGHT, MARIE.

18:53.433 --> 18:55.067
- NO, THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU DON'T KNOW

18:55.067 --> 18:56.700
ABOUT THIS WHOLE
ELIZABETH BUSINESS.

18:56.700 --> 18:58.633
[sighs]

19:06.300 --> 19:09.433
YOU KNOW HOW I DO THINGS
OUT OF LOVE?

19:11.800 --> 19:14.667
- OH, THIS IS NEVER GOOD.

19:17.333 --> 19:19.367
- WHEN YOU WERE
IN HIGH SCHOOL, RAYMOND,

19:19.367 --> 19:20.467
YOU WERE SO LONELY.

19:20.467 --> 19:23.333
I JUST WANTED
YOU TO BE HAPPY.

19:23.333 --> 19:26.233
- WHAT DID YOU DO?

19:26.233 --> 19:28.233
- EVERYTHING I TOLD YOU
ABOUT ELIZABETH

19:28.233 --> 19:30.467
BACK IN HIGH SCHOOL,

19:30.467 --> 19:33.733
THINKING YOU WERE CUTE
AND HAVING A CRUSH ON YOU

19:33.733 --> 19:37.333
WAS A FIB.

19:37.333 --> 19:39.967
- WHAT DO YOU--
YOU LIED TO ME?

19:39.967 --> 19:41.700
- FIBBED.

19:41.700 --> 19:43.500
- WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE. WAIT A MINUTE.

19:43.500 --> 19:45.067
SHE HAD TO LIKE ME
A LITTLE BIT

19:45.067 --> 19:47.333
BECAUSE SHE ASKED ME OUT,
RIGHT, RIGHT?

19:47.333 --> 19:49.367
- SEE, I RAN INTO ELIZABETH
IN THE MARKET,

19:49.367 --> 19:52.667
AND I ASKED HER IF SHE WOULD
PLEASE ASK YOU OUT TO THE DANCE.

19:52.667 --> 19:55.467
- [screams]

19:55.467 --> 19:57.600
- AT FIRST SHE SAID NO,
BUT THEN I TOLD HER

19:57.600 --> 20:00.833
THAT YOU WERE POLITE AND KIND
AND A NICE DRESSER.

20:00.833 --> 20:02.400
- A PITY DATE?

20:02.400 --> 20:04.867
ALL THIS TIME, I WAS--
I WAS A PITY DATE?

20:04.867 --> 20:06.333
- NO, NOT AT ALL.

20:06.333 --> 20:07.600
- OF COURSE I WAS!
- NO.

20:07.600 --> 20:09.033
- I GUESS I WAS RIGHT,
RAYMOND.

20:09.033 --> 20:10.400
WHEN SHE ACCEPTED
YOUR APOLOGY,

20:10.400 --> 20:11.567
SHE WAS PUTTING ON AN ACT.

20:11.567 --> 20:14.000
SHE HAD
TO KEEP FROM LAUGHING.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.600
[laughs]

20:15.600 --> 20:17.233
- YOU COULDN'T
WALK HER TO THE DOOR

20:17.233 --> 20:19.067
'CAUSE SHE WAS RUNNING
FOR THE DOOR.

20:19.067 --> 20:20.367
[laughter]

20:20.367 --> 20:21.867
- THAT'S VERY FUNNY.
VERY FUNNY.

20:21.867 --> 20:24.067
VERY FUNNY!
VERY FUNNY!

20:24.067 --> 20:27.067
[conga music]

20:27.067 --> 20:28.167
NO, NO, I DON'T WANT--

20:28.167 --> 20:32.100
GET OFF ME, YOU FREAKS!

20:32.100 --> 20:33.300
- OH, HI, RAYMOND.
- YEAH, YEAH.

20:33.300 --> 20:35.033
I JUST FOUND SOMETHING OUT.

20:35.033 --> 20:37.400
YOU DIDN'T WANT ME TO WALK YOU
TO THE DOOR, DID YOU, RIGHT?

20:37.400 --> 20:39.300
YOU WEREN'T ACTING WEIRD
BECAUSE YOU LIKED ME.

20:39.300 --> 20:40.733
YOU WERE ACTING WEIRD
BECAUSE YOU

20:40.733 --> 20:42.500
WERE GOING OUT
WITH MAMA'S LITTLE MUTANT!

20:42.500 --> 20:44.067
I'VE FELT BAD
ABOUT WHAT I DID TO YOU

20:44.067 --> 20:45.533
