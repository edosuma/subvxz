she went to a conference

00:51.093 --> 00:52.674
on neurobotic prosthetics.

00:52.803 --> 00:55.010
Oh, that sounds
like a party.
You tagging along?

00:55.222 --> 00:57.929
She asked, but
there was the problem
of the hotel room.

Yeah. Married life gets
complicated like that.

Um, did you weld
the pre-igniter
in the tail service mast?

01:42.352 --> 01:44.764
No, Mom. I decided
to use duct tape
and bubble gum.

is the one subject
he gets excited about,

02:00.037 --> 02:03.120

have been a little iffy.

more to help him.

you're suddenly presented

02:08.879 --> 02:10.915

you're afraid
of with Zoe.

spoken to her since
we've been back.

like herself.

at school, then...

Then I'll know
if it's her.

you want your shirt
to match this napkin.

Why would I want
my shirt to match
a napkin?

necessary?

11:28.771 --> 11:31.103
Well, I'll let
you two catch up.

11:31.858 --> 11:34.395
I'll see you
at the Big House,
tonight?

11:35.069 --> 11:37.731
Oh. No. No.
If you have plans,
by all means.

11:37.864 --> 11:39.070
No, go on.
No. It's fine.

11:39.199 --> 11:40.905
There will be
other parties.

11:41.034 --> 11:42.444
When I'm not
at the library,
studying.

11:42.577 --> 11:44.317
Right.
Tell everyone
hi for me.

11:44.454 --> 11:46.945
Yeah. Sure.
Well, nice to meet you.

11:47.081 --> 11:49.242
Uh, yeah.
Nice to meet you, too.

11:52.879 --> 11:56.497

here's the care package

mess with his brain.

that it's still there.

run the tests again?

it will be some other

not to inhale it.

Zane's blood tests
indicate hyperoxia.

20:11.335 --> 20:13.542
He has an

in his system.

20:13.671 --> 20:15.332
Oxygen?
Yeah, I don't know
how he was exposed.

20:15.464 --> 20:17.170
Most likely
it's what caused
his disorientation.

20:17.299 --> 20:18.254
Right.

20:18.384 --> 20:21.797
Jo, Zane's lucky.

it was my skateboard.

21:14.273 --> 21:15.888
Well, you see,
I needed to catch
more air off the ramp,

so I came up
with the hydrogen

They're going to launch

into the atmosphere.

21:27.119 --> 21:28.825
That's pretty
ingenious, pal.

21:28.954 --> 21:30.160
Thanks.

21:30.289 --> 21:32.951
So you only used
hydrogen peroxide
to fuel this rocket?

21:33.083 --> 21:37.076
Well, different mixtures
for different stages.
Here. Check it out.

21:40.007 --> 21:43.716
Here, Mabel.
Here, girl.

21:45.054 --> 21:47.261

21:47.389 --> 21:48.515
PILAR: Well, duh,
how do you think?

21:48.641 --> 21:51.257
It's a plasmonic
spray causing
negative refraction.

21:51.393 --> 21:54.009
Great. The spray
diverts light waves,
so we won't see Mabel.

21:54.146 --> 21:56.057
We'll just see what
she's in front of.

21:56.273 --> 21:57.479

does it last?

I don't know.

22:00.152 --> 22:01.938
It's designed
to set on fabric.

22:02.071 --> 22:04.278
It's not going
to stabilize on
a live animal's fur.

22:04.406 --> 22:05.907
So, in other words,
she'll just
keep changing.

22:06.033 --> 22:06.943
I don't know.

22:07.076 --> 22:08.816
Thanks, Pilar.
Super helpful.

22:09.620 --> 22:11.485
That cat was 80%
of my final grade.

22:11.622 --> 22:14.489
(SCREAMS) There's
something in there.

22:14.875 --> 22:16.081
Sorry.

22:16.502 --> 22:17.867
Found her.

22:24.218 --> 22:27.961
VINCENT:
Reacquiring signal.
And signal reacquired.

22:28.097 --> 22:30.053
And we are back
from the dark side

22:30.182 --> 22:31.888
with Kevin Blake
still leading
the way home.

22:32.017 --> 22:33.393
(ALL CHEERING)

22:39.108 --> 22:40.018
Allison.
Huh?

22:40.150 --> 22:41.526
Can I have
a word with you
for a minute?

22:41.652 --> 22:43.062
Yeah, sure.

22:45.072 --> 22:46.687
GRANT: I don't know
how to tell you
this, Allison.

22:48.158 --> 22:50.865
It's possible
Kevin may have had
an unfair advantage.

22:51.412 --> 22:53.448
What? What are you saying?

22:54.373 --> 22:56.830
I'm saying Kevin's
a brilliant kid,

22:56.959 --> 22:58.995
but he may have
felt pressured into
boosting his propellant

22:59.128 --> 23:01.915
with something outside
the race parameters.

23:02.548 --> 23:03.913
Like what?

23:04.049 --> 23:05.459
Well, I don't know.

23:05.718 --> 23:06.924
But the formula
he claims he used

23:07.052 --> 23:09.008
wouldn't result
in a flare
with that color.

23:09.847 --> 23:11.178
I'm so sorry,

23:11.307 --> 23:12.888
but I thought
you should know.

23:26.989 --> 23:29.480
Andy, you're a robot.
How can you
be unavailable?

23:29.617 --> 23:31.778
I need you
to help me find...

23:33.579 --> 23:34.694
Zane.

23:35.581 --> 23:37.162
What changed your mind?

23:37.625 --> 23:38.785
I don't know.

23:38.918 --> 23:41.079
Nobody's ever
stuck their neck
out for me before.

23:41.837 --> 23:43.293
Did you steal
Dr. Ramsey's
TAP fluid?

23:45.382 --> 23:46.292
What are you
talking about?

23:46.425 --> 23:49.417
If you didn't take it,
then there's got
to be more to this.

23:49.553 --> 23:51.339
I'm going up to
the crash site
to find Andy

23:51.472 --> 23:53.884
and see if I can
figure this out.

23:55.935 --> 23:57.345
You want to come with?

23:59.021 --> 24:01.057
Yeah, you'd be aiding
an escaped prisoner.

24:02.024 --> 24:04.766
(CHUCKLES)
I'll arrest myself later.

24:07.613 --> 24:08.944
ZANE: Why did
you let me go?

24:09.114 --> 24:10.900
JO: Maybe I give you
too much credit,

24:11.033 --> 24:13.240
but I think under
the snarky posturing

24:13.369 --> 24:14.779
there really is
a decent guy.

24:15.454 --> 24:17.069
The real me sounds boring.

24:17.206 --> 24:19.913
(LAUGHS) You're too
irritating to be boring.

24:20.250 --> 24:21.410
Funny.

24:22.670 --> 24:24.831
You're always
busting my ass,

24:25.005 --> 24:28.247
but once in a while,
I get this feeling
aboutyou.

24:29.718 --> 24:31.094
What kind of feeling?

24:33.305 --> 24:34.294
Uh...

24:35.182 --> 24:36.388
Dizzy.

24:39.144 --> 24:40.930
Me... Me, too.

24:42.564 --> 24:43.940
(ACCELERATING)

24:45.901 --> 24:47.516
(TIRES SCREECHING)

25:03.002 --> 25:05.368
I wouldn't start her.
One spark,
and she could blow.

25:05.879 --> 25:06.914
What happened?

25:07.047 --> 25:09.333
The area's
a tad combustible.

25:09.466 --> 25:12.003
You hang tight.
I'll have you back
at G.D. in ajiff.

25:25.691 --> 25:27.898
We're so lucky
you found us, Andy.

25:28.027 --> 25:29.813
I'm sorry you
burst into flames.

25:29.945 --> 25:31.901
Fortunately, I managed
to extinguish myself.

25:32.031 --> 25:35.899
The curious thing is,
Andy can't burn.

25:36.035 --> 25:37.275
ANDY: I assure you
I ignited, sir.

25:37.828 --> 25:38.783
And before my
sensors melted,

25:38.912 --> 25:40.903
they detected
an unusually high
levelofoxygen.

25:41.081 --> 25:42.787
Inhale.
(INHALES)

25:43.459 --> 25:45.916
Not to mention the steel
gantries on the launch site
had rusted.

25:46.045 --> 25:47.910
That could be
the result of
rapid oxidation.

25:48.130 --> 25:49.336
Well, how does
that happen?

25:49.465 --> 25:54.050
Normally, the atmospheric
concentration of oxygen
is 21%,

25:54.636 --> 25:55.887
but if there's
too much oxygen,

25:56.013 --> 26:00.473
then material that is
usually not flammable,
like Andy,

26:00.976 --> 26:03.683
catches fire
very easily.

26:04.229 --> 26:05.935
It just takes a spark.

26:06.774 --> 26:07.763
Like from my cell phone.

26:07.900 --> 26:09.561
So Zane got
loopy and crashed

26:09.693 --> 26:11.558
because there was
too much oxygen
at the launch site?

26:11.695 --> 26:12.730
Yeah. Which would
probably also explain

26:12.863 --> 26:14.694
why he burned up
so much fuel so quickly.

26:14.823 --> 26:15.812
Well, if it was
the oxygen,

26:15.949 --> 26:17.075
then I'm off the hook.

26:17.201 --> 26:19.783
We still don't know
why there's such
a high concentration.

26:19.912 --> 26:22.904
Henry, Dr. Ramsey
said that his TAP
fluid is missing.

26:23.290 --> 26:26.248
Uh, he said that
it could become
self-propagating?

26:26.376 --> 26:27.331
That's a problem.

26:27.461 --> 26:28.871
Yeah, could be
a big one.

26:29.004 --> 26:30.335
Uh, TAP fluid
is very stable.

26:30.464 --> 26:33.797
The electromagnetic
wavelength necessary
to activate it is precise.

26:33.926 --> 26:36.042
But if it has been
activated somehow,

26:36.178 --> 26:40.467
then everything around
Eureka will become
as explosive as Andy.

26:41.767 --> 26:43.382
ZOE: Can you see her?

26:43.519 --> 26:45.680
CARTER: Well, I see tile.

26:45.938 --> 26:47.394

Which could...

26:47.523 --> 26:48.763
(SNARLING)

26:48.899 --> 26:50.184
Yeah, that's her.

26:50.317 --> 26:51.602

26:52.653 --> 26:53.893
Oh. Hey.

26:54.613 --> 26:55.978

26:56.156 --> 26:57.862

26:59.409 --> 27:00.865

27:00.994 --> 27:02.985
Uh...
No, she is in my room.

27:04.706 --> 27:07.322
You look cold.
You should put
a shirt on.

27:07.584 --> 27:10.576
Okay. I will
see you later.

27:14.383 --> 27:15.338

27:15.467 --> 27:16.752
You seriously
like that guy?

27:16.885 --> 27:19.922
Enough with the comments.
You shouldn't even...

27:21.807 --> 27:22.796
What?

27:23.892 --> 27:24.881
Be here.

27:25.352 --> 27:27.434
Like, you show up,
you make a mess
of my project,

27:27.563 --> 27:29.269
and now I'm stuck
in a bathroom

27:29.398 --> 27:31.389
when I should be
out with my friends.

27:31.859 --> 27:33.690
Well, it'sjust we
haven't seen each
other in so long.

27:33.819 --> 27:35.150
Well, then,
call first.

27:35.279 --> 27:36.689
I'm not a little
girl anymore.

27:36.822 --> 27:38.483
I have my own life.

27:39.867 --> 27:40.982

27:41.493 --> 27:42.528

27:45.539 --> 27:46.995
You're right.
You, uh...

27:48.876 --> 27:50.036
Yeah, you should
go to the party.

27:50.502 --> 27:51.787
Don't give me
a guilt trip now.

27:51.920 --> 27:52.750
No. No guilt trip.
I promise.

27:52.880 --> 27:55.292
It, um... I'll take
care of the cat.

28:02.931 --> 28:05.343
(SIGHING)

28:09.771 --> 28:11.511
Well, that went well.

28:13.442 --> 28:14.898
HENRY: The greatest
concentration of
oxygen is up here,

28:15.027 --> 28:16.892
within the highest point
of our EM field,

28:17.029 --> 28:18.064
spreading lower
and lower,

28:18.197 --> 28:19.482
first reaching
the launch site,

28:19.615 --> 28:20.604
then lower down
the mountain,

28:20.741 --> 28:22.948
until, eventually,
it will hit the town.

28:23.118 --> 28:24.619
Then stop it
from expanding.

28:24.745 --> 28:27.111
Yeah. Turn off
the EM field,
and air it all out.

28:27.247 --> 28:30.159
Whoa, man.
What are you smoking?
You can't just release it.

28:30.292 --> 28:32.954
My TAP's designed
to work on
a planetary scale.

28:33.086 --> 28:35.372
It will just keep
leaching oxygen
from the environment.

28:35.505 --> 28:37.541
Dr. Ramsey,
what would possess you

28:37.674 --> 28:39.756
to create something so
potentially catastrophic?

28:39.885 --> 28:42.797
Man, don't blame
the TAP. Okay?
It's harmless on Earth.

28:42.930 --> 28:45.512
To be activated,
it would have to be
irradiated somehow,

28:45.641 --> 28:47.177
with a very
specific wavelength.

28:47.351 --> 28:49.842
Until then, harmless!

28:50.020 --> 28:52.727
The first place
there was trouble
was at the launch site.

28:52.856 --> 28:56.895
Guys? That TAP fluid would
make awesome rocket fuel.

28:57.027 --> 28:59.359
Oh, boy. We adjusted
the EM field.

28:59.488 --> 29:02.651
We must have hit
just the right,
or wrong, frequency

29:02.783 --> 29:03.898
to activate the TAP.

29:04.034 --> 29:05.319
I love it.
It's your fault.

29:05.452 --> 29:10.116
Zane. The question
is who used it
to boost their rocket?

29:10.999 --> 29:12.785
(MONITOR BEEPING)

29:14.336 --> 29:15.451
I said I didn't use it.

29:15.587 --> 29:16.827
Kevin, it's okay.

29:16.964 --> 29:17.953
There's no way
you could have known

29:18.090 --> 29:19.375
the EM field
was re-tuned.

29:19.508 --> 29:21.339
Yeah. But now,
this crazy amount of
oxygen is building up,

29:21.468 --> 29:23.459
and we need to know
exactly what you did.

29:23.637 --> 29:24.752
What's going on, here?

29:24.888 --> 29:27.379
They think I used
Dr. Ramsey's TAP fluid
to boost my rocket,

29:27.516 --> 29:29.302
but I didn't, Mom.
I swear. I didn't.

29:29.434 --> 29:30.594
I know you didn't, Kevin.

29:31.186 --> 29:32.847
How can you
be so sure?

29:34.231 --> 29:35.220
Because I did.

29:35.357 --> 29:36.437
What?

29:38.026 --> 29:39.732
Honey, you had put
so much effort
into your rocket,

29:39.861 --> 29:41.772
and your test burns
weren't going well.

29:42.030 --> 29:43.190
So you cheated?

29:44.449 --> 29:46.030
It was just so
important to you.

29:46.159 --> 29:48.366
So? I mean,
this is my thing, Mom.

29:48.495 --> 29:49.655
You've been acting
like a freak for weeks,

29:49.788 --> 29:51.870

about everything.
And now, this?

29:51.999 --> 29:53.830
Honey, Ijust
didn't want you
to be disappointed.

29:53.959 --> 29:56.200
I'd rather lose the race
than win it like this,

29:56.336 --> 29:58.327

know that about me.

and put my mom's in.

you meant well.

30:08.307 --> 30:10.889
And you couldn't have
known that we re-tuned
the EM shield,

30:11.018 --> 30:14.977
but there's a cloud of
self-propagating oxygen
spreading toward town

30:15.105 --> 30:16.845
and a bunch of rockets
on their way home.

are burning until
they hit the ground.

figure out a way
to stop them,

No, it's safer
if people don't
move around.

it's kind of pointless.

have detonated.

stop the rocket,

on reducing
the oxygen level.

We just have
to combine it
with hydrogen.
