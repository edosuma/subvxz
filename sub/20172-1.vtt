01:49.199 --> 01:50.387
Ok.

01:50.595 --> 01:52.089
I just found a new friend.

01:53.804 --> 01:55.594
Target 2 o'clock.

01:55.887 --> 01:58.922
Range, 1709 meters.

02:00.054 --> 02:04.630
Wind, 3 o'clock, 6 miles per hour.
Wind right quadrant, 2.3 millimeters.

02:04.888 --> 02:06.430
Mike...

02:06.638 --> 02:10.219
I know you're good.
I mean you're very good, okay?

02:11.680 --> 02:13.174
But you're not that good.

02:14.180 --> 02:15.840
We're not here to play.

02:17.097 --> 02:18.805
Then why are we here?

02:22.431 --> 02:23.629
I know what you're thinking.

02:25.640 --> 02:28.343
"We're here to complete the mission."
Come on, man.

02:29.265 --> 02:30.463
What's the point, Tommy?

02:31.849 --> 02:33.757
Okay, the point is that...

02:35.266 --> 02:37.092
We've been here...what?

02:38.516 --> 02:39.616
Two months?

02:39.849 --> 02:41.592
Three months and six days.

02:42.058 --> 02:43.600
Friend, and that's the point.

02:43.891 --> 02:45.551
And exactly that point.

02:45.933 --> 02:48.388
Three months and six days...

02:48.892 --> 02:50.302
you're far from Jenny.

02:50.975 --> 02:52.173
Oh Jenny...

02:52.267 --> 02:53.430
Jenny, I love you.

02:54.601 --> 02:56.225
Jenny, I want to kiss you.

02:56.559 --> 02:58.302
Oh Jenny... Jenny, kiss me.

02:58.393 --> 02:59.803
Contact!
Who?

03:01.018 --> 03:02.118
Shit.

03:05.727 --> 03:06.827
They're here.

03:07.685 --> 03:10.056
Oxen, Oxen! Alpha Margo 4.

03:10.685 --> 03:12.061
Elvis is in the building.

03:12.894 --> 03:13.977
Where, Oxen?

03:14.186 --> 03:16.889
The target should arrive in a
black Land Cruiser with an escort.

03:16.978 --> 03:19.135
Confirm target before next step.

03:19.853 --> 03:21.644
You said black, it's gray...

03:21.728 --> 03:22.828
...and another vehicle.

03:24.645 --> 03:26.104
It's always a Land Cruiser, Mike.

03:34.021 --> 03:35.121
Something's going on.

03:52.064 --> 03:53.227
It seems to be for...

03:54.648 --> 03:56.190
...celebrating some sort of ceremony.

04:01.232 --> 04:02.346
Land Cruiser approaching.

04:29.901 --> 04:33.185
Target is Sayid Assiff, 65 years old.

04:33.610 --> 04:34.772
Confirm, over.

04:36.151 --> 04:38.108
Target, 10 o'clock.

04:38.402 --> 04:40.192
Range 977 meters.

04:41.527 --> 04:42.627
Range 977.

04:43.319 --> 04:44.398
Index.

04:49.778 --> 04:51.983
Maybe he grew a beard
since he was last photographed.

04:53.986 --> 04:55.086
I think it's him.

04:56.820 --> 04:57.920
Target confirmed.

04:59.612 --> 05:00.712
Shoot.

05:16.322 --> 05:17.422
It's a wedding.

05:21.322 --> 05:22.437
So?

05:24.197 --> 05:25.822
Repeat, over.

05:28.906 --> 05:30.006
So?

05:34.073 --> 05:36.610
Target confirmed, over.

05:40.907 --> 05:42.007
Send it.

05:43.532 --> 05:44.633
Send it.

05:49.325 --> 05:50.404
Alpha Margo 4...

05:50.950 --> 05:52.823
Confirm kill, over.

05:55.284 --> 05:56.446
I don't have a clean shot.

05:59.284 --> 06:00.384
Oxen...

06:00.867 --> 06:02.491
The groom is blocking the target.

06:03.118 --> 06:04.398
We're waiting for instructions, sir.
Over.

06:17.827 --> 06:20.317
Mike, don't get any ideas, ok?
This is what we're here for.

06:21.869 --> 06:24.110
Neutralize the target, over.

06:24.369 --> 06:27.701
Mike, don't freak out,
just shoot the guy!

06:34.870 --> 06:37.195
Alpha Margo 4 to Oxen,
it's a wedding.

06:37.662 --> 06:40.578
You're asking me to kill the
groom and his father.

06:40.663 --> 06:41.991
Confirm, over.

06:42.496 --> 06:46.443
Alpha Margo 4, it took us 13 months
to locate Sayid Assiff.

06:46.746 --> 06:49.236
As far as we know, Assiff has no children...

06:49.330 --> 06:51.618
but that guy could be part
of the same terrorist cell.

06:51.705 --> 06:53.329
No need for a clean shot,

06:53.497 --> 06:55.738
Neutralize and confirm. Over.

06:58.956 --> 07:01.161
See, Mike? Terrorists get married too.

07:01.581 --> 07:03.123
We're not even sure that's Assiff.

07:03.206 --> 07:04.404
He came from a different vehicle...

07:04.498 --> 07:06.454
and you know that from here we
can't confirm his identity!

07:09.790 --> 07:10.869
Shoot, Mike.

07:16.041 --> 07:17.748
Shoot the damn shot, Mike.

07:23.250 --> 07:24.578
Confirm, over.

07:25.125 --> 07:26.583
Fuck it, Mike!
Shoot!

07:35.084 --> 07:36.744
Oxen, the target moved.
I lost him.

07:37.251 --> 07:39.207
Alpha Margo 4 off.
Damn it, Mike!

09:15.926 --> 09:17.089
Alpha Margo 4.

09:17.677 --> 09:18.791
Mission canceled.

09:19.677 --> 09:22.842
We need extraction.
Come and get us, over.

09:33.428 --> 09:35.835
Give us your new position, over

09:38.262 --> 09:39.304
Negative.

09:39.512 --> 09:42.133
GPS is out of order, over.

09:42.262 --> 09:45.012
Copy that, wait for orders,
we'll find a new position...

09:52.930 --> 09:54.030
What are you doing?

09:54.305 --> 09:55.405
Something.

10:02.764 --> 10:04.535
Hey, check over there!

10:10.115 --> 10:13.702
Sandstorm! Sandstorm!
Sandstorm! Sandstorm! Sandstorm!

10:13.769 --> 10:14.953
Let's go! Let's go!

10:37.871 --> 10:42.222
Mayday, Mayday! Alpha Margo 4!
We require immediate extraction!

10:42.393 --> 10:44.717
Sandstorm approaching, over!

10:45.893 --> 10:49.011
The new position for the extraction
is a village six clicks to the west.

10:49.102 --> 10:50.382
Do you copy? Over.

10:51.893 --> 10:53.471
Negative, I didn't get that!

10:53.852 --> 10:56.970
A village six clicks west of here? Over.

11:00.394 --> 11:01.971
Great, Mike!

11:02.311 --> 11:03.805
5 hours on foot!

11:05.395 --> 11:08.394
The West and the...
I know which way is West!

11:24.813 --> 11:26.390
Do you know what day it is?

11:27.147 --> 11:28.247
Its Tuesday.

11:28.688 --> 11:29.803
Not any Tuesday, Mike.

11:29.897 --> 11:31.177
It's the second Tuesday of the month,

11:31.272 --> 11:33.015
so my son's waiting for my call.

11:33.647 --> 11:34.731
I know.

11:34.939 --> 11:36.349
I've never missed one.

11:38.564 --> 11:40.106
What do you usually talk about?

11:41.106 --> 11:42.351
How old is he now, four?

11:43.356 --> 11:45.893
Actually, he's decided...

11:46.607 --> 11:48.231
to become a vegetarian.

11:48.899 --> 11:51.471
The other day,
Anne was at home, cleaning...

11:52.232 --> 11:55.599
She looked in the garden and there
was Jake, who walked around muttering.

11:55.691 --> 11:56.791
So she says: "Jake!"

11:57.524 --> 11:58.983
"Jake, what are you doing?"

11:59.483 --> 12:03.312
So, he turns around with a leaf in his
mouth and says: "My name is not Jake!"

12:04.900 --> 12:06.098
"I'm a brontosaurus!"

12:10.317 --> 12:11.859
My friend...and crazy!

12:14.734 --> 12:16.358
I know, maybe it's all bullshit...

12:16.984 --> 12:18.562
but they make me feel better.

12:20.651 --> 12:21.849
Unbelievable, right?

12:22.693 --> 12:27.399
I thought this marriage thing
was a big mistake. A curse.

12:28.194 --> 12:29.771
But then along came Jake...

12:30.736 --> 12:33.486
and it changed everything.
I mean, I always fought...

12:33.569 --> 12:35.229
and we still fight all the time...

12:35.403 --> 12:38.153
but now we have this little man that
makes us careful about what we say.

12:38.236 --> 12:41.271
We used to lose control.
We said stupid things.

12:41.695 --> 12:42.810
We didn't talk for days.

12:42.903 --> 12:43.983
But then, Jake...

12:44.820 --> 12:45.983
He starightened us out.

12:50.029 --> 12:51.440
I know that look.

12:52.779 --> 12:55.398
What's on your mind, Mike?
Eh?

12:56.196 --> 12:57.988
Is there something you need to tell me?

12:58.863 --> 13:02.526
Say it you can't hold it inside.
Whatever it is, you have to let it out.

13:02.988 --> 13:05.064
It's much better if you air it.

13:07.281 --> 13:09.403
You want to ask
Jenny to marry you, right?

13:12.323 --> 13:15.448
The thing is...
It's complicated.

13:15.656 --> 13:16.740
It's a big step.

13:16.948 --> 13:18.442
Already it's complicated?

13:21.824 --> 13:22.924
It's a...

13:23.865 --> 13:24.965
small step...

13:25.782 --> 13:27.157
for humanity...

13:27.991 --> 13:29.817
but a big step...

13:30.241 --> 13:31.341
for a man.

13:33.616 --> 13:37.865
Oh, Mike, you really
are a mess, you know?

13:38.408 --> 13:39.488
What's wrong?

13:41.534 --> 13:42.617
This is Oxen...

13:42.825 --> 13:45.492
we don't see any guerillas
in your area, Alpha Margo,

13:45.826 --> 13:49.109
but if you stick your heads up,
they'll come looking for you,

13:49.534 --> 13:51.656
The new position for the extraction
is away from their shelters...

13:51.743 --> 13:52.843
and sandstorms,

13:53.368 --> 13:56.949
We can't use helicopters and the mission
doesn't include ground transportation.

13:57.577 --> 13:59.035
II you have to cross the desert...

13:59.577 --> 14:01.236
the dunes will
keep changing shape...

14:01.327 --> 14:02.987
so the radio won't always work.

14:03.827 --> 14:04.927
Hold on, Marines!

14:06.327 --> 14:07.952
I don't see anything
with all this sand.

14:10.245 --> 14:11.655
I think I see something moving.

14:13.953 --> 14:15.089
Maybe the natives.

14:17.537 --> 14:18.637
What are they doing?

14:19.495 --> 14:20.631
It looks like...

14:21.454 --> 14:22.554
they're...

14:22.787 --> 14:23.887
digging...

14:25.163 --> 14:26.361
in the sand.

14:54.332 --> 14:55.612
If those were the Berbers...

14:56.207 --> 14:57.914
it means that we're
heading in the right direction...

14:59.791 --> 15:01.450
unless it was just a mirage.

15:51.212 --> 15:53.879
I know that it's very effective
but it's just a trick of the Berbers.

15:53.962 --> 15:57.411
They use these signs to keep the
enemies away from the village.

15:57.754 --> 16:00.504
I just want to say that
we must be close, man.

16:00.921 --> 16:04.288
The village is probably
right behind that dune.

16:05.213 --> 16:06.313
Over there.

16:07.422 --> 16:08.522
Come on, let's go.

16:14.381 --> 16:17.250
Over the last 40 years,
there's been over 8,000 battles...

16:18.256 --> 16:20.497
and we've buried 33 million
mines in this area.

16:23.673 --> 16:24.773
Mines?

16:26.007 --> 16:28.496
I like when you're optimistic, Mike.

16:29.028 --> 16:31.507
Ok!
Listen, Mr. Wikipedia...

16:31.590 --> 16:33.629
You can find everything in the desert.

16:34.382 --> 16:36.007
As old as this sign looks...

16:36.091 --> 16:38.877
who knows where it comes from
and what it really says?

16:40.175 --> 16:41.799
Mike, don't get paranoid.

16:41.966 --> 16:44.124
Don't let this thing
screw up your head.

16:44.758 --> 16:46.039
I'm just considering our options.

16:47.092 --> 16:48.835
We have two options,

16:49.342 --> 16:51.381
because we're really lucky guys.

16:51.467 --> 16:54.218
We can back off and die of thirst,

16:55.259 --> 16:58.591
or we can get to the village
within an hour, Mike.

16:59.718 --> 17:01.342
I know which option to choose.

17:25.554 --> 17:26.654
You know what?

17:27.095 --> 17:28.231
I don't really like water.

17:28.679 --> 17:29.877
It's overrated.

17:30.221 --> 17:31.321
It has no taste.

17:49.973 --> 17:51.073
A beautiful...

17:52.681 --> 17:53.781
icy...

17:54.431 --> 17:55.531
Granita...

17:58.390 --> 17:59.800
is what I want.

18:00.640 --> 18:02.881
Usually, I drink it with lemon...

18:03.432 --> 18:04.547
but this time...

18:05.682 --> 18:07.176
I'll take the strawberry.

18:20.892 --> 18:21.992
Thanks, Mike.

18:33.391 --> 18:37.203
Whoa! Oh, ok.

18:37.411 --> 18:41.517
Mmm! Ok, Mike!

18:42.769 --> 18:43.869
You know what?

18:45.102 --> 18:46.810
Forget what I said about water.

18:48.519 --> 18:51.886
A couple of drops gets
you going again!

18:55.228 --> 18:56.328
Come on, Mike.

18:57.937 --> 18:59.037
Come on, Mike!

19:03.687 --> 19:04.788
Come on, Mike!

19:14.397 --> 19:17.479
You have to stop thinking about
that sign, you're losing it!

19:18.772 --> 19:20.314
I'm not surprised...

19:20.522 --> 19:22.479
since you're you.

19:24.148 --> 19:26.186
You do have to explain one thing.

19:26.815 --> 19:27.915
How is it possible

19:28.273 --> 19:31.557
that a psychopath like you...

19:37.232 --> 19:40.813
You're not afraid to get into
fights with...how many were there?

19:41.316 --> 19:42.416
I think they...

19:43.274 --> 19:45.183
Four? No, five...

19:45.775 --> 19:49.437
of the biggest Army
Rangers I've ever seen...

19:49.525 --> 19:55.641
and then shit your pants for a sign flying
in the desert from who knows where?

19:56.150 --> 19:57.431
I just had a premonition.

19:59.567 --> 20:02.685
I feel that there is a
Granita stand in that village.

20:06.276 --> 20:07.900
Who knows, maybe...

20:45.780 --> 20:49.360
Tommy?! Listen to me,
you have to calm down, okay?!

20:50.239 --> 20:51.484
You have to calm down, fuck!

20:55.114 --> 20:56.738
Mayday Mayday, this is Alpha-Marg...

20:57.364 --> 20:59.273
Mike, it hurts!

20:59.823 --> 21:01.614
Tommy, listen to me!
I can't move, okay?

21:01.865 --> 21:05.065
I stepped on one too!
Oh, my God, Mike!

21:07.032 --> 21:08.407
Tommy, you have to calm down now, okay?

21:08.699 --> 21:10.240
We have to get to the village!

21:10.574 --> 21:12.613
If you stay like this,
we'll never make it!

21:13.157 --> 21:14.616
Yes, ok, the village...

21:15.074 --> 21:16.355
Okay, I'll get there!

21:18.074 --> 21:19.450
You have to grab the radio!

21:19.491 --> 21:20.575
Yeah!

21:20.783 --> 21:22.574
Come on, you can do it!
Ok, I can do it.

21:22.825 --> 21:25.611
Mike, I can do it.

21:27.117 --> 21:28.445
Ok, I see my backpack.

21:30.159 --> 21:31.274
Grab it, Marine. Reach!

21:33.076 --> 21:34.176
Come on, Tommy!

21:35.201 --> 21:37.358
No Mike, it hurts!
You have to grab the radio, man!

21:37.451 --> 21:40.201
I can't move, I can't!
Yes you can! Reach!

21:42.118 --> 21:44.359
Grab your medical kit!
The middle pocket!

21:44.452 --> 21:46.159
The thing is... Come on, man!
Get the kit! Ok, ok!

21:48.119 --> 21:50.194
Come on, Marine, get it!
Ok, ok.

21:51.327 --> 21:52.407
So?

21:52.619 --> 21:53.900
Grab your medical kit!

21:55.328 --> 21:56.490
Well done, Marine!

21:57.661 --> 21:59.155
You did it. Well done.

22:00.453 --> 22:01.553
Well done.

22:02.662 --> 22:04.453
I got it.
So do you.

22:05.370 --> 22:06.991
No, no!
Tommy, you have to...

22:07.912 --> 22:11.620
Come on, man, you need that morphine!
Reach, Marine, reach...

22:11.642 --> 22:12.684
Concentrate!

22:12.788 --> 22:14.330
Concentrate, ignore the pain!

22:14.621 --> 22:17.869
Think training!
We have to get to the village!

22:18.622 --> 22:19.722
And then...

22:20.413 --> 22:21.824
you have to call Jake!
Repeat that!

22:22.830 --> 22:24.159
Jake...
Exactly.

22:24.289 --> 22:27.039
Jake is waiting for me...
And Tuesday!

22:27.956 --> 22:29.782
That's right Marine. Now move!

22:32.831 --> 22:34.823
No, don't look, Tommy.
Mike, I have no legs!

22:34.915 --> 22:36.409
No, Tommy, don't look!
I have no legs!

22:36.498 --> 22:37.909
Come on man, don't look!

22:39.082 --> 22:41.785
Don't look!
Mike I'm no longer your legs!

22:42.124 --> 22:43.534
Mike, I'm no longer your legs!

22:44.249 --> 22:45.529
Be strong, it's next to you!

22:47.749 --> 22:48.849
That's right.

22:49.083 --> 22:50.183
Well done!

22:54.458 --> 22:55.917
Now you can reach your backpack?

22:56.083 --> 22:57.163
We need the radio.

22:58.125 --> 22:59.951
No, wait, one dose is
more than enough.

23:02.292 --> 23:03.392
No, Tommy!

23:04.126 --> 23:05.785
No, one is enough!

23:07.331 --> 23:12.331
Ok, ok, alright.

23:12.876 --> 23:14.619
I need to listen to me.

23:14.877 --> 23:16.833
You have to reach the backpack.

23:17.252 --> 23:19.493
You have to get the radio, ok?
Ok.

23:20.460 --> 23:21.561
Can you?

23:22.961 --> 23:24.061
Bravo, grab the bag!

23:25.753 --> 23:27.246
There, I got it!

23:27.419 --> 23:29.246
Well done!
I got it!

23:29.503 --> 23:30.603
Bravo!

23:34.920 --> 23:35.999
I got it.
You did it!

23:39.650 --> 23:40.733
Well done, mate.

23:40.837 --> 23:41.937
Everything will be fine!

23:44.463 --> 23:45.625
Alpha Margo 4...

23:47.921 --> 23:51.335
Man down. I can't hear you.
I can't hear you in my com

23:51.463 --> 23:53.336
You have to turn the radio on!
I need a phone...

23:53.338 --> 23:54.401
to call Jake.

23:54.505 --> 23:57.172
I need a phone to call... my son...

23:57.714 --> 23:59.670
Tommy, can't hear you in my com.

23:59.756 --> 24:02.708
Check that the walkie is on!
A lemon Granita...

24:04.006 --> 24:05.106
All right.

24:05.548 --> 24:08.298
Stay with me.
I don't want strawberry...

24:08.590 --> 24:11.293
Mike, you know what I want?
Stay with me, Tommy!

24:12.048 --> 24:13.132
The village...

24:13.340 --> 24:15.830
Yes, I have to get to the village.
Beautiful Sara, Mike...

24:16.507 --> 24:18.084
You'll see, it'll be beautiful.

24:18.174 --> 24:20.753
It'll be ok, man.
Now I get it.

24:20.841 --> 24:23.875
Maybe this old mine is rusty and
doesn't work anymore. Now I get it.

24:25.341 --> 24:27.084
Don't even think about it, Mike!

24:27.175 --> 24:29.048
I have to do something!
Do not even think about it, Mike!

24:29.133 --> 24:30.876
You're losing too much blood!

24:31.092 --> 24:33.084
I won't let you die!

24:36.509 --> 24:38.666
Mike, can you tell Jake
that I love him so much?

24:40.843 --> 24:42.253
Stay alive, my friend.
No!

26:51.354 --> 26:52.454
Shit.

29:57.329 --> 29:58.429
The battery.

31:59.924 --> 32:03.540
Mayday, Mayday, Alpha Margo 4
to Oxen. Do you copy, over?

32:07.966 --> 32:10.337
Alpha Margo 4 to Oxen. Do you copy?

32:10.966 --> 32:12.066
Over.

32:13.258 --> 32:14.358
Base camp here,

32:14.800 --> 32:18.000
We've been trying for hours,
Alpha Margo. Over.

32:19.175 --> 32:20.586
I copy, Oxen.

32:22.134 --> 32:23.960
Sir, my partner was killed
on this mission.

32:24.467 --> 32:27.668
and I'm in critical condition,
I request immediate extraction with EOD.

32:27.968 --> 32:29.068
Over.

32:29.635 --> 32:31.710
Define critical, Sergeant. Over.

32:33.552 --> 32:35.508
I stepped on an explosive device, sir.

32:37.719 --> 32:40.588
The same kind that
killed my spotter, over.

32:45.636 --> 32:47.047
Major! Over.

32:49.345 --> 32:51.632
What about the mission, Sergeant? Over.

32:56.845 --> 32:57.945
Failed, sir.

32:58.846 --> 33:00.256
But I need help.

33:01.096 --> 33:04.379
Sir, I need immediate help. Over.

33:05.679 --> 33:08.051
What's your position, Alpha Margo?
Over.

33:12.138 --> 33:13.467
I can't say for sure.

33:13.930 --> 33:15.128
The GPS is out of order.

33:16.014 --> 33:17.114
We're about...

33:17.639 --> 33:19.796
4 hours east
of the point of release.

33:21.931 --> 33:23.031
Copy.

33:23.556 --> 33:26.176
You're still an hour
from the village. Over.

33:30.515 --> 33:32.258
I don't know if you understood
what my current situation is...

33:32.349 --> 33:37.054
I'm stuck with my left
foot on a goddam mine. Over.

33:37.891 --> 33:41.838
Copy, Alpha Margo, I understand
your situation clearly, over.

33:42.808 --> 33:46.222
Great, you get my situation clearly!
So come and get me! Over.

33:47.350 --> 33:48.475
Negative.

33:48.683 --> 33:51.469
Our choppers can't fly
because of the continuous sandstorms.

33:51.559 --> 33:52.659
Over.

33:53.600 --> 33:54.680
Shit.

33:59.268 --> 34:01.010
So what's the plan? Over.

34:02.726 --> 34:06.508
There's a convoy under fire
near the border

34:06.977 --> 34:12.891
If all goes well, it will be in your
area in about 52 hours, Sergeant.

34:12.976 --> 34:14.077
Over.

34:14.311 --> 34:15.411
Sir...

34:15.561 --> 34:16.686
with all due respect...

34:16.893 --> 34:21.600
If all goes well, I don't know
if I can survive for 52 hours.

34:22.103 --> 34:23.203
Over.

34:24.228 --> 34:26.931
Be prepared to report your position
when the time will comes.

34:27.437 --> 34:29.476
We will contact you by radio...

34:29.770 --> 34:31.051
to make sure that you're...

34:31.437 --> 34:32.600
still there,

34:33.146 --> 34:34.246
Over.

34:35.853 --> 34:36.954
That's it?

34:37.728 --> 34:39.768
What happened to
"No one left behind"?

34:40.396 --> 34:41.496
Over.

34:41.980 --> 34:43.522
Listen to me, Sergeant Stevens,

34:43.813 --> 34:49.100
The type of mines scattered in that area
can remain active for about 40 years...

34:49.230 --> 34:53.094
but ten years after production,
so they say...

34:53.188 --> 34:55.596
about 4% will malfunction.

34:55.938 --> 35:00.563
After 15 years in,
this can be as high as 7%.

35:01.357 --> 35:02.457
Great.

35:03.148 --> 35:05.436
Considering the situation,
my personal advice...

35:05.565 --> 35:09.263
if you can't survive
until we come...

35:09.482 --> 35:11.142
try the the Schumann Maneuver.

35:12.524 --> 35:15.144
The Schumann Maneuver, Major? Over.

35:16.108 --> 35:17.483
It's a last resort.

35:17.733 --> 35:20.602
Dig a small trench to shelter
you from the explosion...

35:22.317 --> 35:24.522
then fasten the sole of
your boot to the ground.

35:24.609 --> 35:25.744
Major?

35:26.317 --> 35:27.421
Major?

35:27.526 --> 35:28.609
Over.

35:28.614 --> 35:32.935
You can avoid harm to your major organs
from the shock wave of the blast...

35:37.026 --> 35:39.314
Fuck the Schumann Maneuver!

36:19.572 --> 36:20.672
Perfect.

38:52.252 --> 38:53.352
That's it, huh?

39:21.838 --> 39:22.938
Pardon me, Tom.

39:24.922 --> 39:26.416
I have to change the batteries.

40:34.761 --> 40:35.861
Thanks, my friend.

41:54.018 --> 41:55.119
No water.

41:56.394 --> 41:57.494
No radio.

42:02.353 --> 42:04.226
This is your last stop, Mike.

42:17.521 --> 42:19.394
Help!

42:23.313 --> 42:24.413
Help!

42:39.439 --> 42:40.539
Come on, Mike.

43:03.295 --> 43:04.379
Stop!

43:04.483 --> 43:06.191
Show me your hands,
don't take another step!

43:13.734 --> 43:14.897
Do you understand me?

43:17.818 --> 43:19.016
Don't move!

43:19.568 --> 43:20.978
It's a minefield!

43:21.776 --> 43:24.022
Full of mines here!
Boom!

43:32.694 --> 43:33.829
You find it funny?

43:38.236 --> 43:39.611
Did you put the mines here?

43:39.736 --> 43:41.278
That's why it's so amusing?

43:45.258 --> 43:46.341
Listen, man.

43:46.445 --> 43:49.112
Please.
I can't stay stuck here forever.

43:50.904 --> 43:52.019
Why are you stuck?

43:53.154 --> 43:54.482
Thank God, he understands...

43:54.696 --> 43:56.853
Well, listen, I need
water and a radio.

43:57.238 --> 43:59.029
Is your village over that dune?

43:59.571 --> 44:00.671
Water!

44:01.738 --> 44:02.838
Radio!

44:06.947 --> 44:08.062
Why did you stop here?

44:08.530 --> 44:09.572
Not going home...

44:09.781 --> 44:10.881
to your family?

44:13.698 --> 44:14.798
Are you kidding?

44:17.490 --> 44:18.770
My left foot...

44:19.198 --> 44:20.822
is on a mine!

44:21.407 --> 44:22.569
If I move...

44:24.615 --> 44:25.715
Do you get it?

44:26.220 --> 44:27.303
Why is that?

44:27.407 --> 44:28.688
Yes, this is why!

44:30.491 --> 44:31.591
Are you sure?

44:34.533 --> 44:35.695
You see this body?

44:36.491 --> 44:38.898
This is Thomas Madison, my best friend.

44:39.033 --> 44:42.863
And he died because he stepped
on one of your mines!

44:44.784 --> 44:45.982
The mines aren't mine.

44:48.326 --> 44:49.606
Don't worry for your friend...

44:50.659 --> 44:51.857
he's at peace now...

44:52.618 --> 44:53.816
but you're alive.

44:54.576 --> 44:56.070
You have to take the next step now.

44:59.385 --> 45:02.656
No!
Next?

45:03.869 --> 45:05.149
My next step...

45:05.619 --> 45:07.243
will be my last.

45:08.411 --> 45:09.511
Understand?

45:35.101 --> 45:36.184
Thank you.

45:36.288 --> 45:37.451
Thank you, thank you.
Now...

45:37.788 --> 45:39.330
since you're here, please,
give me the radio.

45:40.080 --> 45:44.122
Give me the radio, watch, and backpack then.
You just take the radio.

45:45.873 --> 45:46.973
Please.

45:48.831 --> 45:49.915
The radio is useless.

45:50.123 --> 45:51.223
There's no music now.

45:51.602 --> 45:52.665
No dancing.

45:52.769 --> 45:56.196
No, you didn't understand, I need to...
You need to take next step.

46:02.207 --> 46:03.307
Wait.

46:04.541 --> 46:05.641
Where are you going?

46:07.416 --> 46:08.696
And why are you walking like that?

46:09.958 --> 46:11.238
Do you know where the mines are?

46:12.917 --> 46:14.494
Because I have one under my foot!

46:15.209 --> 46:17.745
I'm on a mine,
so there's no next step for me!

46:17.917 --> 46:19.017
Understood, asshole?

46:20.084 --> 46:21.578
You must always keep going.

46:24.209 --> 46:25.309
What an idiot.

46:35.044 --> 46:36.144
Come on, Marine.

46:36.794 --> 46:38.039
This is a simple mission.

46:58.629 --> 46:59.744
This is better than nothing.

47:39.383 --> 47:40.483
Wait...

47:45.675 --> 47:46.775
Be careful...

47:57.759 --> 47:58.859
Thank you.

47:59.134 --> 48:00.235
Thank you thank you...

48:15.386 --> 48:17.010
Can you tell your father
that I thank you...

48:18.470 --> 48:19.880
very, very much...

48:20.511 --> 48:23.594
and I am very, very grateful?

48:36.596 --> 48:38.090
Look what you have.

48:40.388 --> 48:41.488
A...

48:42.013 --> 48:43.388
a soldier!

48:51.306 --> 48:52.406
Like this.

48:55.056 --> 48:56.192
I have one myself.

48:59.598 --> 49:00.698
Is this yours?

49:27.017 --> 49:28.117
I'm stuck.

49:33.143 --> 49:34.243
I can't move.

49:39.143 --> 49:40.244
Since you're here...

49:41.352 --> 49:43.427
Would you mind
going over there to get that radio?

49:45.644 --> 49:46.744
Right there,

49:47.144 --> 49:48.244
in the bag.

49:49.269 --> 49:50.763
Would you get it for me, please?

49:53.686 --> 49:55.346
Please, get me to the radio.

49:57.395 --> 49:58.495
It's right there.

50:02.896 --> 50:05.930
At least look where I'm pointing.
Get on the radio!

50:06.896 --> 50:07.975
The radio!

50:09.354 --> 50:10.455
No, wait!

50:12.188 --> 50:13.288
Wait...

50:13.688 --> 50:14.730
Wait, no...

50:14.938 --> 50:16.183
I was not scolding.

50:17.230 --> 50:18.724
Just I am trying to
get the radio...

52:58.786 --> 52:59.886
Your Highness...

53:05.454 --> 53:09.034
This secret message
is your amulet. It will...

53:09.662 --> 53:12.662
be able to protect you from evil forces,
my knight...

53:13.704 --> 53:15.198
Don't worry, ok?

53:15.871 --> 53:17.531
I know you have to leave...

53:19.121 --> 53:20.615
so, go...

53:21.997 --> 53:25.328
defeat your demons as a
knight in shining armor.

53:27.706 --> 53:29.744
without blemish and without fear.

53:32.706 --> 53:34.497
I'm sure it's going to go well...

53:36.790 --> 53:37.890
I know.

53:40.415 --> 53:41.957
But don't take too long.

53:42.249 --> 53:44.454
Win this war and come back to me,

53:46.207 --> 53:47.291
Otherwise...

53:47.499 --> 53:51.197
I'll have to find another guy...

53:52.874 --> 53:55.329
A Delta Force type...

53:56.750 --> 53:57.948
or maybe a Ranger.

54:01.792 --> 54:02.871
I love you,

56:49.349 --> 56:50.926
You're a lucky man!

56:55.641 --> 56:56.776
Here we go again.

56:58.308 --> 56:59.408
Look, man...

56:59.808 --> 57:01.716
I'm not in the mood
for your bullshit...

57:01.933 --> 57:03.806
I didn't sleep so well last night.

57:04.767 --> 57:05.846
What's your name?

57:10.100 --> 57:11.180
Mike.

57:12.809 --> 57:15.725
"Mike" in your language and
"Man who can't take the next step" in mine!

57:19.060 --> 57:21.051
Mike is Michael.

57:22.602 --> 57:24.095
But what would a Berber know.

57:24.643 --> 57:25.758
Mike and Michael.

57:27.435 --> 57:28.977
You called me "Berber"...

57:29.894 --> 57:31.222
but you know what a Berber is?

57:32.227 --> 57:33.328
I know.

57:33.894 --> 57:36.893
He's a guy who won't
get the radio even if you ask him.

57:38.395 --> 57:42.260
I bet that your daughter brought me the
water bottle yesterday without telling you.

57:47.312 --> 57:48.391
In my language...

57:48.979 --> 57:51.931
Berber means free man.

57:52.979 --> 57:54.224
Why aren't you a free man?

57:56.855 --> 58:01.474
Ok. Ok.
You stepped on a mine...

58:03.355 --> 58:04.397
in the end...

58:04.605 --> 58:07.060
but you're a very lucky man.

58:08.147 --> 58:10.291
You step on a mine and it doesn't explode.

58:10.303 --> 58:12.687
You spend the night in the desert and
the animals leave you alone.

58:13.564 --> 58:15.687
You're a very lucky man, Mike and Michael!

58:17.315 --> 58:18.415
Good.

58:18.857 --> 58:19.957
Thank you.

58:20.315 --> 58:21.939
Now can we...
Mike and Michael...

58:23.940 --> 58:25.434
Why did you step on the mine?

58:27.024 --> 58:29.976
i didn't know there was a mine...

58:30.274 --> 58:32.147
when I stepped.

58:33.358 --> 58:35.930
I don't know where the mines are,
like you do!

58:36.983 --> 58:38.442
You're wrong, Mike and Michael.

58:38.733 --> 58:40.524
We don't know where the mines are.

58:41.234 --> 58:43.225
I saw you walk around,

58:43.484 --> 58:44.682
going all zig-zag.

58:45.609 --> 58:46.688
You know the paths.

58:47.693 --> 58:50.099
I don't know where the mines are.

58:50.359 --> 58:53.039
If I walk straight into a minefield...

58:53.093 --> 58:55.435
sooner or later,
I'll step on a mine, for sure.

59:04.569 --> 59:07.023
I figured out what your problem is...

59:08.674 --> 59:09.799
you're scared.

59:10.007 --> 59:12.566
Come on, really?

59:12.799 --> 59:13.882
Don't tell me.

59:13.987 --> 59:15.397
No, you don't understand.

59:15.820 --> 59:18.523
No matter where you are now,
it only matters where you want to go.

59:22.987 --> 59:24.565
I just want to go to my house...

59:25.738 --> 59:26.817
to my family.

59:28.113 --> 59:29.856
I only follow my destiny.

59:33.572 --> 59:35.812
It seems that my destiny is still here.

59:37.655 --> 59:39.482
I made my last misstep.

59:41.072 --> 59:44.875
Every day you step
may be your last step.

59:45.073 --> 59:46.531
So what's the difference today?

59:47.323 --> 59:49.564
The difference is that today...

59:51.282 --> 59:54.234
I know that,
even if I was a lucky man...

59:54.574 --> 59:58.154
I have only a 7%
chance of not dying.

59:59.324 --> 01:00:00.604
7%

01:00:01.574 --> 01:00:02.674
Good.

01:00:13.034 --> 01:00:15.440
So, it was all incredibly
philosophical and everything...

01:00:17.076 --> 01:00:18.176
but could you please...

01:00:19.034 --> 01:00:20.134
bring me...

01:00:20.659 --> 01:00:22.201
my radio?

01:00:27.618 --> 01:00:28.718
Thank you.

01:00:44.245 --> 01:00:46.236
Ready? No, I'm busy!

01:00:57.329 --> 01:00:58.492
Why did you step on the mine?

01:01:02.538 --> 01:01:04.281
Because we were marching
toward the village.

01:01:05.413 --> 01:01:06.492
Why get to the village?

01:01:07.247 --> 01:01:10.116
Because we were lost in the desert.
Why in the desert?

01:01:10.330 --> 01:01:12.820
Because that was our mission.
Why mission?

01:01:13.247 --> 01:01:15.120
Because we're at war.

01:01:15.622 --> 01:01:17.413
And why are you at war?

01:01:19.873 --> 01:01:21.781
You want to kill the enemy?

01:01:23.170 --> 01:01:25.452
No.
I am a soldier.

01:01:26.290 --> 01:01:28.697
And why are you a soldier?

01:01:31.166 --> 01:01:32.266
Because...

01:01:35.208 --> 01:01:36.785
I had no reasons to stay.

01:01:38.208 --> 01:01:39.750
I had no more.

01:01:43.375 --> 01:01:45.201
Why "no more"?

01:02:10.252 --> 01:02:12.244
You still want the radio?

01:02:53.715 --> 01:02:56.500
Become a free man!

01:02:58.382 --> 01:03:00.041
You must go on.

01:03:01.674 --> 01:03:05.171
The wrong path can take you home too.

01:03:05.716 --> 01:03:06.961
I won't ever give up.

01:03:10.799 --> 01:03:12.210
Stay alive, man!

01:04:46.391 --> 01:04:47.491
It'll be fine

01:04:47.725 --> 01:04:49.053
It'll all be fine.

01:04:49.725 --> 01:04:50.825
Shut up.

01:04:52.434 --> 01:04:54.011
You're the one whose gone,

01:04:54.309 --> 01:04:55.637
Shut up.

01:04:56.976 --> 01:04:58.386
What else could I do?

01:04:58.476 --> 01:05:00.598
Where were you when she was sick?

01:05:01.038 --> 01:05:03.767
Please, do me a favor
and leave me alone.

01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:06.660
Now what do you want?

01:05:07.143 --> 01:05:08.222
You disappeared to...

01:05:09.477 --> 01:05:12.346
who knows where, all these years...

01:05:12.894 --> 01:05:13.973
and now you come back
and you want to talk?

01:05:14.727 --> 01:05:15.827
Ok.

01:05:16.352 --> 01:05:17.452
Let's talk.

01:05:17.852 --> 01:05:18.953
We're here...

01:05:19.269 --> 01:05:20.369
it's a perfect opportunity.

01:05:20.603 --> 01:05:22.640
What's up, huh?

01:05:29.687 --> 01:05:30.787
Don't you dare mention it!

01:05:31.770 --> 01:05:33.478
Don't you dare even say his name!

01:05:35.396 --> 01:05:37.103
Who got to you, man?

01:05:42.771 --> 01:05:43.871
Tommy?

01:05:49.064 --> 01:05:50.688
You're a real disaster.

01:05:54.772 --> 01:05:56.480
Let's roll, soldier.

01:05:57.189 --> 01:05:58.600
We have to go home.

01:06:02.273 --> 01:06:04.431
Or do you think Jenny
will be waiting forever?

01:06:14.066 --> 01:06:15.524
Do not worry, my friend.

01:06:18.608 --> 01:06:19.723
Not going anywhere.

01:06:31.526 --> 01:06:32.626
It's useless.

01:06:33.568 --> 01:06:34.647
The train is coming.

01:06:36.026 --> 01:06:37.852
We'll call them
when we get the signal.

01:06:38.068 --> 01:06:42.351
So you don't need to keep calling them.
You'll just kill the batteries.

01:06:43.152 --> 01:06:44.231
Right?

01:06:45.694 --> 01:06:46.892
Right.

01:06:57.236 --> 01:06:58.351
Come on, Mike.

01:06:58.445 --> 01:07:00.022
Stop it, please.

01:07:00.112 --> 01:07:01.653
It's just your imagination.

01:07:01.737 --> 01:07:04.689
It's impossible that your phone rings
here, in the middle of the desert.

01:07:06.904 --> 01:07:08.004
Look.

01:07:10.654 --> 01:07:12.397
Dad

01:07:13.529 --> 01:07:15.237
This can't happen...

01:07:16.446 --> 01:07:17.582
and you know it, right?

01:07:19.363 --> 01:07:21.236
You don't know shit, Tom!

01:07:23.155 --> 01:07:24.400
You know what? It's true.

01:07:26.281 --> 01:07:29.897
You never had the balls to tell me
anything about what's eating you.

01:07:37.157 --> 01:07:38.271
I'm sorry, Tom.

01:07:42.949 --> 01:07:44.573
You have left when you were most needed.

01:07:46.157 --> 01:07:48.030
Just like I did with Jenny.

01:07:48.741 --> 01:07:50.283
Is not the same thing.

01:07:51.408 --> 01:07:52.818
I'm just like him!

01:07:54.033 --> 01:07:55.133
No, that's not true.

01:07:56.908 --> 01:07:58.532
That's why you'll go back to Jenny.

01:08:02.326 --> 01:08:03.903
Because she loves you...

01:08:04.492 --> 01:08:05.773
for what you are.

01:08:09.326 --> 01:08:10.654
Because she's waiting for you...

01:08:16.577 --> 01:08:18.450
and that's why
you have to stay alive.

01:08:56.788 --> 01:08:57.889
Attention.

01:09:04.872 --> 01:09:06.071
I have enough ammo for them all!

01:09:06.456 --> 01:09:07.785
You're right,
we know the maneuver.

01:09:08.247 --> 01:09:10.038
What maneuver?
The maneuver, the Schumann Maneuver!

01:09:10.122 --> 01:09:11.700
You're kidding,
it's never going to work!

01:09:12.790 --> 01:09:14.367
If animals are attacking
you all at once.

01:09:14.665 --> 01:09:16.408
they'll make you fall
and the mine will explode!

01:09:16.832 --> 01:09:18.243
Quick, there's no time!

01:09:19.874 --> 01:09:20.974
Yes, exactly.

01:09:21.207 --> 01:09:22.536
You must attach the sole to the ground.

01:09:24.041 --> 01:09:25.125
It should work.

01:09:25.332 --> 01:09:28.000
The mine sensor won't sense
the pressure change immediately.

01:09:28.125 --> 01:09:29.453
Do you know anyone there who did it?

01:09:37.292 --> 01:09:38.407
Bravo!

01:09:39.772 --> 01:09:42.331
At least we'll be able to get
a few tenths of a second more!

01:09:43.335 --> 01:09:45.871
You may not get out in one piece,
but at least get out alive!

01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:47.073
Now, Marine...

01:09:47.667 --> 01:09:48.768
Dig!

01:09:49.085 --> 01:09:50.247
That's bullshit!

01:09:50.356 --> 01:09:51.439
Go ahead!

01:09:51.544 --> 01:09:53.251
Don't stop!

01:09:56.336 --> 01:09:57.450
Strength!

01:09:57.544 --> 01:09:58.659
Keep digging!

01:09:58.857 --> 01:10:00.642
Dig, Marine, dig!

01:10:14.983 --> 01:10:16.067
Strength!

01:10:16.171 --> 01:10:18.127
Mike, do it now.

01:10:18.963 --> 01:10:20.063
Do it now!

01:10:30.584 --> 01:10:32.981
Your Highness...

01:10:50.632 --> 01:10:52.256
I solemnly swear...

01:10:54.841 --> 01:10:56.714
to be a brave knight,

01:10:58.675 --> 01:10:59.955
Reverent...

01:11:00.758 --> 01:11:02.038
and always friendly.

01:11:03.967 --> 01:11:05.212
A champion...

01:11:05.634 --> 01:11:07.507
in truth and justice.

01:11:10.384 --> 01:11:11.484
I solemnly swear...

01:11:12.759 --> 01:11:13.838
to be honest...

01:11:14.509 --> 01:11:15.609
and good.

01:11:17.885 --> 01:11:19.083
I swear...

01:11:20.052 --> 01:11:21.545
to protect our Kingdom.

01:11:23.802 --> 01:11:25.461
And I swear it all...

01:11:26.094 --> 01:11:27.552
in your presence...

01:11:29.344 --> 01:11:30.719
my princess.

01:11:52.513 --> 01:11:53.971
Now can I have that beer,

01:11:55.346 --> 01:11:56.446
please?

01:12:02.826 --> 01:12:04.156
Margo 4...

01:12:04.295 --> 01:12:06.072
Alpha Margo 4,

01:12:06.847 --> 01:12:07.948
This is Oxen.

01:12:07.952 --> 01:12:09.181
Do you copy?

01:12:09.389 --> 01:12:10.489
Over.

01:12:15.432 --> 01:12:16.594
Oxen. Oxen, I'm here...

01:12:17.932 --> 01:12:19.032
Alpha...
Alpha Margo...

01:12:23.807 --> 01:12:24.907
It's me.

01:12:25.849 --> 01:12:26.949
It's Mike.

01:12:27.933 --> 01:12:29.033
Copy.

01:12:29.641 --> 01:12:31.016
Copy, Alpha Margo 4...

01:12:31.266 --> 01:12:33.009
The convoy for the extraction
is on the way.

01:12:33.516 --> 01:12:35.971
Echo Bravo 3 is coming in your direction,
Sergeant...

01:12:37.142 --> 01:12:38.221
The convoy is requesting...

01:12:39.684 --> 01:12:42.517
Eco Bravo 3 and is still under fire.

01:12:43.601 --> 01:12:44.763
They are delayed.

01:12:45.059 --> 01:12:48.094
The new ETA for the extraction
is now 17 hours.

01:12:48.768 --> 01:12:49.868
Did you copy that, Sergeant?

01:12:50.726 --> 01:12:54.556
You've got to last
another 17 hours, Sergeant.

01:12:55.143 --> 01:12:56.244
Can you do it?

01:13:03.811 --> 01:13:04.911
I can't.

01:13:07.603 --> 01:13:08.703
Sergeant Stevens...

01:13:11.061 --> 01:13:13.267
I'd like to mention that
we have someone here.

01:13:14.562 --> 01:13:17.347
Given his situation, we decided
to call his...over.

01:13:23.479 --> 01:13:24.579
Is it Jenny?

01:13:25.729 --> 01:13:27.188
May I please speak with Jenny?

01:13:28.980 --> 01:13:30.390
Communication unclear...

01:13:30.647 --> 01:13:31.747
Do you copy?

01:13:33.814 --> 01:13:34.914
Can you hear me?

01:13:36.314 --> 01:13:37.414
Sweetheart?

01:13:39.731 --> 01:13:43.476
Jenny, I'm sorry.

01:13:44.481 --> 01:13:46.805
I ruined everything, like always.

01:13:48.857 --> 01:13:51.393
But at least this time,
don't say it's okay.

01:13:53.524 --> 01:13:54.624
There's no need...

01:13:55.107 --> 01:13:56.566
to say that "this is the deal,"

01:13:57.566 --> 01:13:59.522
I can't adjust and
I ruin everything.

01:14:03.483 --> 01:14:04.763
Because I broke our pact.

01:14:08.108 --> 01:14:09.271
I shouldn't have left.

01:14:10.650 --> 01:14:11.750
I should have stayed.

01:14:13.859 --> 01:14:15.851
I had to make a lot of changes...

01:14:21.484 --> 01:14:24.235
but everything I touch falls apart.

01:14:26.402 --> 01:14:28.726
All the good things are destroyed.

01:14:34.777 --> 01:14:35.857
And that's why I'm here.

01:15:11.322 --> 01:15:14.985
I'm a free man but not always a lucky one.

01:15:16.739 --> 01:15:17.902
When the mine took my leg...

01:15:19.781 --> 01:15:21.323
I thought my life was over.

01:15:21.990 --> 01:15:24.859
I remember it like it was yesterday.

01:15:29.991 --> 01:15:31.899
I was so afraid in the hospital.

01:15:33.491 --> 01:15:34.591
I only thought...

01:15:35.033 --> 01:15:36.443
My leg is gone.

01:15:36.533 --> 01:15:40.824
I only thought about all the
things I could never do anymore.

01:15:41.867 --> 01:15:44.403
There was a radio...

01:15:44.867 --> 01:15:47.273
that played music in the hospital.

01:15:47.951 --> 01:15:49.051
The singer said...

01:15:49.576 --> 01:15:52.148
"You always have to keep going,

01:15:52.618 --> 01:15:55.238
you always have to keep going. "

01:15:56.076 --> 01:15:57.451
But I didn't listen to the singer.

01:15:57.535 --> 01:15:59.776
I only thought of my leg.

01:16:00.035 --> 01:16:01.493
My leg was gone.

01:16:02.577 --> 01:16:07.366
How everything could
only be bad in my future.

01:16:09.827 --> 01:16:11.701
Then, in comes a nurse...

01:16:11.869 --> 01:16:13.991
and she smiles...

01:16:15.286 --> 01:16:16.946
at me!

01:16:19.287 --> 01:16:20.567
So I listen to the song.

01:16:23.787 --> 01:16:26.703
"You always have to keep going,

01:16:27.412 --> 01:16:30.198
you always have to keep going. "

01:16:31.996 --> 01:16:33.075
Maybe this bad thing...

01:16:33.705 --> 01:16:36.704
was the only way to get
to something beautiful.

01:16:38.247 --> 01:16:39.622
And so I met my wife.

01:16:40.830 --> 01:16:41.966
She took care of me.

01:16:43.330 --> 01:16:44.741
And our children were born.

01:16:46.331 --> 01:16:48.074
My life with only one leg...

01:16:49.748 --> 01:16:50.848
it's beautiful.

01:16:51.623 --> 01:16:52.723
You understand what I'm saying?

01:16:54.915 --> 01:16:56.015
Now.

01:16:57.873 --> 01:17:00.245
This will make you crazy.

01:17:01.290 --> 01:17:02.391
You...

01:17:03.124 --> 01:17:05.199
you'll see things...

01:17:06.708 --> 01:17:07.906
and then everything will be fine.

01:17:08.374 --> 01:17:09.475
Drink.

01:17:17.834 --> 01:17:19.114
I've seen your daughter.

01:17:21.334 --> 01:17:22.876
She brought the bottle.

01:17:25.001 --> 01:17:26.101
I...

01:17:26.543 --> 01:17:27.823
brought you water bottle...

01:17:29.376 --> 01:17:30.476
Mike and Michael.

01:17:31.376 --> 01:17:33.582
They are wrong to think
they are unlucky...

01:17:33.918 --> 01:17:35.791
and a really beautiful little girl.

01:17:37.419 --> 01:17:38.960
She has your smile.

01:17:44.878 --> 01:17:47.581
I have only 3 sons now.

01:17:49.295 --> 01:17:50.954
My little girl was with me...

01:17:51.753 --> 01:17:52.916
when the mine exploded...

01:17:54.295 --> 01:17:55.395
many years ago.

01:17:57.879 --> 01:17:59.124
We gathered mines together...

01:18:00.254 --> 01:18:01.333
Selling them to the guerrillas.

01:18:02.671 --> 01:18:03.916
Very valuable, those mines.

01:18:04.713 --> 01:18:06.207
We were very poor...

01:18:08.380 --> 01:18:09.515
and she was very good.

01:18:12.255 --> 01:18:13.370
She would take a stick...

01:18:13.797 --> 01:18:15.207
and poke it sideways.

01:18:15.380 --> 01:18:17.088
She'd find a mine...

01:18:17.922 --> 01:18:21.289
and then carefully dig, dig, dig.

01:18:21.548 --> 01:18:23.504
She pulled out the mine...

01:18:24.173 --> 01:18:26.461
and put old cans.

01:18:28.173 --> 01:18:30.165
Metal detectors can't find makeup.

01:18:32.090 --> 01:18:33.205
Then, one day...

01:18:37.591 --> 01:18:39.215
a mine takes my leg.

01:18:41.008 --> 01:18:42.108
I'm not so lucky.

01:18:42.341 --> 01:18:43.441
I live..

01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:45.875
and her fate came before mine.

01:18:48.467 --> 01:18:49.842
But I'm happy...

01:18:50.550 --> 01:18:54.759
that the desert makes jokes
and lets you meet her.

01:19:00.718 --> 01:19:01.818
I lost so much...

01:19:02.551 --> 01:19:04.424
when she stepped on the mine that day...

01:19:07.218 --> 01:19:10.632
because I am not
a very lucky man like you.

01:19:13.636 --> 01:19:16.505
But I'm a free man.

01:19:20.303 --> 01:19:21.678
I moved on.

01:19:22.261 --> 01:19:24.134
I always move on.

01:19:25.095 --> 01:19:27.549
That's why you always have to keep going.

01:19:29.637 --> 01:19:31.048
I always take the next step,

01:19:31.596 --> 01:19:33.137
although next step may be difficult...

01:19:33.721 --> 01:19:34.835
too big...

01:19:36.179 --> 01:19:39.048
and scarey.

01:19:42.097 --> 01:19:44.088
You know how not to be afraid?

01:19:46.472 --> 01:19:47.634
I have to become...

01:19:48.764 --> 01:19:49.962
a free man.

01:20:10.557 --> 01:20:11.657
Don't go...

01:20:13.808 --> 01:20:15.385
Don't leave me too...

01:21:44.316 --> 01:21:45.561
I have some problems,

01:21:47.399 --> 01:21:48.499
The guys at work...

01:21:49.358 --> 01:21:50.638
I don't think they like me...

01:21:52.358 --> 01:21:54.930
I don't know, maybe
you just need to relax.

01:21:55.275 --> 01:21:57.314
Tell me, you call this respect?

01:21:58.109 --> 01:22:01.227
I'm sorry, I was just trying
to understand the situation,

01:22:04.193 --> 01:22:07.026
Tell me, Rose, do you call this respect?
I'm sorry.

01:22:10.026 --> 01:22:11.141
I don't. I'll show you, Rose.

01:22:11.902 --> 01:22:13.395
I respect you, Bob. You know.

01:22:14.277 --> 01:22:15.984
Just don't do that, okay?

01:22:16.319 --> 01:22:17.454
Mike's awake.

01:22:17.735 --> 01:22:18.836
Please.

01:22:19.361 --> 01:22:20.902
I don't care who wakes up, you hear?

01:22:21.402 --> 01:22:22.731
In my house.

01:22:23.153 --> 01:22:25.109
And I deserve respect from you, Rose!

01:22:25.361 --> 01:22:26.985
Did you understand?
I get it.

01:22:27.070 --> 01:22:29.476
I respect you, Bob.
You know I respect you.

01:22:29.820 --> 01:22:31.646
It's like a war out there, you know?

01:22:32.820 --> 01:22:35.487
To find the money to feed you!

01:22:36.612 --> 01:22:38.272
For you and that kid!

01:22:38.362 --> 01:22:39.446
Maybe...

01:22:39.550 --> 01:22:40.737
try to...

01:22:40.743 --> 01:22:43.855
I don't know, don't drink too much,
maybe he can help...

01:22:43.946 --> 01:22:45.938
Shut up, Rose!

01:22:48.738 --> 01:22:49.838
Hello, sweetheart.

01:22:54.697 --> 01:22:55.797
Hey, Mikey.

01:22:56.739 --> 01:22:57.839
I woke you up?

01:22:59.239 --> 01:23:00.614
You have something to say, boy?

01:23:01.573 --> 01:23:03.280
I get it. Come on, boy!

01:23:03.427 --> 01:23:04.490
I'm right here!

01:23:04.495 --> 01:23:06.814
You peed in the bed?
You're a baby, remember that.

01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:10.737
You wet the bed, Mikey?
Leave him alone, he's a child.

01:23:10.824 --> 01:23:11.924
Rose!

01:23:12.199 --> 01:23:13.299
Shut up, Rose!

01:23:14.366 --> 01:23:16.441
Get out of this house! Get out!

01:23:16.532 --> 01:23:18.359
And you call this respect?

01:23:19.324 --> 01:23:21.648
At your age, boy... I was a man.

01:23:21.825 --> 01:23:25.689
Don't you dare talk to me
like that in front of Mikey!

01:23:28.783 --> 01:23:30.822
Mikey, you don't
have the balls, kid!

01:23:30.909 --> 01:23:33.398
No problem, Mikey.
Now I'll show you how to become a man.

01:24:42.998 --> 01:24:44.161
You have something to say, boy?

01:24:44.249 --> 01:24:45.493
Listen!

01:24:50.291 --> 01:24:51.405
I'm right here!

01:24:56.541 --> 01:24:57.641
Strength.

01:24:58.250 --> 01:24:59.333
Come on, boy!

01:24:59.542 --> 01:25:01.415
I'm right here!
I'm right here,

01:25:01.708 --> 01:25:03.451
Wait a minute, darling.

01:25:03.542 --> 01:25:06.541
Why such a hurry? Sit with us
for a bit. What'll it cost you?

01:25:06.667 --> 01:25:08.078
I won't bite, you'll see!

01:25:08.167 --> 01:25:10.325
It's really the
wrong night for this, okay?

01:25:10.418 --> 01:25:12.042
So let's make it the right night!

01:25:12.105 --> 01:25:13.189
Come on, dear.

01:25:13.293 --> 01:25:14.538
Come on, sit here.

01:25:14.835 --> 01:25:16.115
Got something to say?

01:25:17.210 --> 01:25:18.325
I feel you.

01:25:18.627 --> 01:25:19.789
I feel you.

01:25:26.586 --> 01:25:28.210
Come on, boy.
I'm right here.

01:26:49.260 --> 01:26:50.360
Hey, Mike! Mike! Mike!

01:26:51.843 --> 01:26:52.943
Look at me.

01:26:54.802 --> 01:26:55.917
You see, down there at the bottom?

01:26:56.344 --> 01:26:57.886
The cavalry is finally coming.

01:27:01.886 --> 01:27:02.986
It's a mirage.

01:27:04.178 --> 01:27:05.755
I can't go on.
No.

01:27:06.845 --> 01:27:07.928
No, Mike.

01:27:07.933 --> 01:27:09.719
It's not a mirage.

01:27:10.262 --> 01:27:11.362
I'm here, my friend.

01:27:13.345 --> 01:27:14.424
It's not a mirage!

01:27:15.929 --> 01:27:17.968
We have to tell them that we're here...

01:27:18.346 --> 01:27:19.721
or they won't find us.

01:27:20.179 --> 01:27:22.883
Alpha Margo 4, Alpha Margo 4...

01:27:23.096 --> 01:27:24.638
Echo Bravo 3 coming,

01:27:24.721 --> 01:27:26.298
Where, Sergeant Stevens?

01:27:27.096 --> 01:27:28.211
Signals your pos...

01:27:30.513 --> 01:27:31.639
I'm here!

01:27:31.644 --> 01:27:33.381
Alpha Margo 4, we're leaving.

01:27:33.472 --> 01:27:35.464
I'm down here!
We can't stay long!

01:27:35.556 --> 01:27:36.966
We don't see the Sergeant, where is he?

01:27:39.806 --> 01:27:40.885
No, I'm here!

01:27:41.889 --> 01:27:43.087
I'm here!

01:27:44.681 --> 01:27:45.765
Come on, Mike.

01:27:45.973 --> 01:27:48.463
Mike, we have to go.

01:27:50.099 --> 01:27:51.234
You have to concentrate.

01:28:08.142 --> 01:28:09.242
Here...

01:28:09.809 --> 01:28:11.516
a small step for mankind...

01:28:13.351 --> 01:28:14.451
but...

01:28:14.851 --> 01:28:16.428
a big step for a man.

01:28:18.080 --> 01:28:19.164
Can you hear me?

01:28:19.268 --> 01:28:20.368
You better get moving!

01:28:20.601 --> 01:28:21.706
I'm here!

01:28:21.810 --> 01:28:22.910
?Why are you getting married.

01:28:24.227 --> 01:28:25.327
Do you remember me?

01:28:26.143 --> 01:28:27.279
Do you remember?

01:28:31.727 --> 01:28:32.842
You're dead.

01:28:44.770 --> 01:28:46.229
Tommy died.

01:29:56.818 --> 01:30:00.648
Render unto you homage to the crown

01:30:00.902 --> 01:30:03.190
and sworn allegiance to our Kingdom.

01:30:05.986 --> 01:30:07.086
Your Highness...

01:30:07.611 --> 01:30:09.402
I solemnly swear...

01:30:09.819 --> 01:30:11.313
to be a brave knight.

01:30:13.153 --> 01:30:16.022
Reverent and always polite...

01:30:16.362 --> 01:30:19.065
a champion of truth and justice...

01:30:19.612 --> 01:30:22.694
and I solemnly swear
to be honest and good.

01:30:24.154 --> 01:30:25.648
I swear to protect our Realm.

01:30:26.529 --> 01:30:28.023
And I swear it all in your presence...

01:30:31.905 --> 01:30:33.005
my princess.

01:30:39.530 --> 01:30:40.630
I want it!

01:30:44.531 --> 01:30:45.631
What do you want?

01:30:57.990 --> 01:31:00.480
I want you to be...

01:31:01.991 --> 01:31:03.105
a brave knight.

01:32:35.999 --> 01:32:37.623
It remains alive, Mike and Michael.

01:34:01.465 --> 01:34:03.208
You have to let me go, Mike,

01:34:15.758 --> 01:34:18.425
Don't be afraid if
the suffering stops, honey.

01:34:21.967 --> 01:34:23.130
I'm not afraid...

01:34:26.801 --> 01:34:27.915
not anymore.

01:34:37.843 --> 01:34:39.467
You're a strong guy.

01:34:41.385 --> 01:34:42.500
You're honest...

01:34:43.969 --> 01:34:45.104
and you're good.

01:34:46.511 --> 01:34:49.463
And I know that nothing will
ever be able to stop you.

01:34:50.386 --> 01:34:51.486
Never.

01:34:53.178 --> 01:34:54.720
But you have to let me go.

01:34:59.179 --> 01:35:00.637
You have to move on.

01:35:47.558 --> 01:35:48.658
Come on, boy.

01:35:57.059 --> 01:35:58.159
I'm right here.

01:36:17.269 --> 01:36:18.811
Now I can have one beer, please?

01:36:20.353 --> 01:36:21.453
Jenny?

01:36:43.355 --> 01:36:44.730
It's why you're here, Mike.

01:37:04.273 --> 01:37:05.373
Why you're here.

01:37:10.315 --> 01:37:11.690
You have to move on.

01:38:10.404 --> 01:38:12.147
7%...

01:38:13.821 --> 01:38:14.936
good.

01:38:19.155 --> 01:38:23.020
You always have to go on...

01:38:24.697 --> 01:38:29.097
You always have to go on...
