00:02.600 --> 00:04.034
<i>My name is Barry Allen,</i>

00:04.120 --> 00:05.998
<i>and I am
the fastest man alive.</i>

00:06.080 --> 00:07.196
<i>To the outside world,</i>

00:07.280 --> 00:09.192
<i>I'm an ordinary
forensic scientist.</i>

00:09.320 --> 00:10.595
<i>But secretly, with the help</i>

00:10.680 --> 00:12.319
<i>of my friends
at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

00:12.400 --> 00:15.154
<i>I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.</i>

00:15.240 --> 00:17.550
<i>But when my daughter came back
from the future to help,</i>

00:17.640 --> 00:19.871
<i>she changed the present.</i>

00:19.960 --> 00:22.475
<i>And now our world
is more dangerous than ever.</i>

00:22.560 --> 00:24.870
<i>And I'm the only one
fast enough to save it.</i>

00:25.000 --> 00:27.435
<i>I am the Flash.</i>

00:28.360 --> 00:30.158
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

00:30.240 --> 00:31.640
I want to believe
that there is good

00:31.680 --> 00:33.034
inside of you
somewhere, Thawne.

00:33.120 --> 00:34.713
Let me prove there is.

00:34.800 --> 00:36.496
<i>The shards weren't
dampening my powers.</i>

00:36.520 --> 00:38.512
They were removing them.

00:38.640 --> 00:40.472
We could make
a meta-human cure.

00:40.600 --> 00:43.069
Earl Cox.
Ralph Dibny's gone straight.

00:43.160 --> 00:44.640
So when you let
your new friends down,

00:44.680 --> 00:45.716
<i>give your old one a call.</i>

00:45.800 --> 00:47.792
So you think Cicada
is hiding out here,

00:47.880 --> 00:48.976
<i>just lurking
behind those doors.</i>

00:49.000 --> 00:50.878
It's the inside
of Dwyer's house.

00:50.960 --> 00:52.838
Didn't you have, like,
seven marriages?

00:52.920 --> 00:56.277
I did have seven marriages.
Five wives, seven marriages.

00:56.360 --> 00:58.192
So I'm gonna need you
to tell me right now

00:58.280 --> 00:59.760
why you're investigating Nora.

00:59.840 --> 01:02.116
I've made a career
out of noticing things

01:02.200 --> 01:03.475
<i>that other people miss.</i>

01:21.040 --> 01:24.317
Who is your accomplice,
Nora West-Allen?

01:35.520 --> 01:36.840
<i>There's always a Wells.</i>

01:36.920 --> 01:38.400
He knows I'm working
with someone.

01:38.480 --> 01:41.439
But he doesn't know
with whom you're working.

01:41.520 --> 01:43.159
- Not yet.
- How can you be sure?

01:43.240 --> 01:46.790
Because if he did,
your father would be here

01:46.880 --> 01:50.157
right now in a flash,
threatening to put his hand

01:50.240 --> 01:52.072
right through my heart.

01:52.160 --> 01:56.040
Eobard, if my father
finds out

01:56.120 --> 01:57.270
you've been helping me

01:57.360 --> 01:59.352
<i>try to catch Cicada
behind his back,</i>

01:59.440 --> 02:00.999
he'll hate me,

02:01.080 --> 02:02.833
- and...
- Shh.

02:03.560 --> 02:05.119
This can all be fixed.

02:05.200 --> 02:07.192
I can fix this.

02:07.280 --> 02:08.633
How?

02:08.720 --> 02:14.910
A man... does not wear
another man's face

02:15.000 --> 02:18.437
unless he understands
his mind.

02:18.520 --> 02:20.830
Not just through time

02:22.160 --> 02:24.072
but across infinite Earths.

02:24.160 --> 02:26.550
This Sherloque, yes,
he's brilliant,

02:26.640 --> 02:32.193
but to redirect his gaze,
one only has to nudge him

02:32.280 --> 02:34.920
toward his weakness:

02:35.680 --> 02:37.160
Love.

02:39.720 --> 02:41.279
Tell me what to do.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.515
Well, what do you think?

02:51.680 --> 02:53.239
Looks great.

02:53.320 --> 02:55.516
I mean, I can move the couch
against the wall,

02:55.600 --> 02:57.910
if that'll help.

02:58.000 --> 03:02.870
Iris, it's just couch in
the corner or against the wall

03:02.960 --> 03:05.600
is pretty much the extent of my
interior design knowledge.

03:05.680 --> 03:07.114
I'm sorry, babe.

03:07.200 --> 03:08.696
It's... it's just,
it's been a week since

03:08.720 --> 03:10.096
I launched the
<i>Central City Citizen,</i>

03:10.120 --> 03:11.760
and I am still struggling
to gain readers,

03:11.840 --> 03:15.390
and I think I just
figured out why.

03:15.480 --> 03:17.836
"Iris West-Allen's first
published articles

03:17.920 --> 03:19.639
as an aspiring
online news maven

03:19.760 --> 03:21.797
bring one word to mind:

03:21.880 --> 03:23.553
'Boring.'

03:23.680 --> 03:26.878
Her stories lack the edgy
content made popular

03:26.960 --> 03:29.191
by sites such as
Spencer Young's

03:29.280 --> 03:30.794
game-changing Spyn Zone.

03:30.880 --> 03:34.112
In short,
Iris West-Allen plays it safe."

03:34.200 --> 03:35.998
Iris, come on.

03:36.080 --> 03:37.434
You can't listen to this.

03:37.520 --> 03:39.000
You're a real journalist.

03:39.080 --> 03:40.760
You don't want to write
like Spencer Young.

03:40.840 --> 03:42.240
She didn't care about facts.

03:42.320 --> 03:43.376
Yeah, but at least
she wrote about things

03:43.400 --> 03:44.516
that people cared about,

03:44.600 --> 03:46.990
like I did when I was
writing about DeVoe.

03:47.120 --> 03:48.759
You wanna write about Cicada.

03:52.040 --> 03:53.440
Fine.

03:53.520 --> 03:54.840
Call me if you need me.

03:54.960 --> 03:57.031
- I'll be at S.T.A.R. Labs.
- Yes, of course.

03:57.120 --> 03:59.316
I've got a lot
of digging to do,

03:59.400 --> 04:02.313
and I think I have a hunch
where to start.

04:02.400 --> 04:04.232
- Mwah.
- All right.

04:08.360 --> 04:10.238
So you really think
this might be it?

04:10.320 --> 04:12.710
Cisco sent me this sample
to corroborate his findings,

04:12.800 --> 04:14.029
and it all checks out.

04:14.120 --> 04:16.430
I'm sending it back to him
for final processing,

04:16.519 --> 04:17.856
but I think we may
have found a way

04:17.880 --> 04:19.916
- to suppress the meta genome.
<i>- Great.</i>

04:20.000 --> 04:22.071
Then we can use it
to de-power Cicada,

04:22.160 --> 04:23.576
- stop him for good.
<i>- So what's the plan?</i>

04:23.600 --> 04:25.160
Put this thing in
a tranq gun and go all

04:25.240 --> 04:26.674
<i>American Sniper</i> on him?

04:26.760 --> 04:28.991
It's not that simple.

04:29.120 --> 04:32.511
So Cisco's breakthrough came
from analyzing identical twins

04:32.600 --> 04:34.576
who were hit by the particle
accelerator dark matter,

04:34.600 --> 04:37.115
cases where one developed
powers and the other didn't.

04:37.200 --> 04:39.192
The key difference
in both cases...

04:39.280 --> 04:41.272
<i>- The pituitary gland?</i>
- Exactly.

04:41.360 --> 04:43.477
In some cases,
the pituitary gland

04:43.560 --> 04:45.677
metabolizes dark matter,
thus manifesting

04:45.760 --> 04:47.319
in meta powers.

04:47.400 --> 04:49.835
So to turn a meta-human
into a human-human...

04:49.920 --> 04:53.391
We neutralize the dark matter
in the pituitary gland.

04:53.520 --> 04:54.954
Except there's one problem.

04:55.040 --> 04:57.111
<i>The cure isn't instant.</i>

04:57.200 --> 04:59.760
<i>We would have to immobilize
Cicada for long enough</i>

04:59.840 --> 05:01.115
<i>for the cure to take effect.</i>

05:01.200 --> 05:04.352
- How long will that take?
- Best guess, a minute.

05:04.440 --> 05:06.480
It's gonna be damn near
impossible to hold him still

05:06.560 --> 05:08.074
for one second,
much less 60.

05:08.200 --> 05:09.873
Okay, but we're so close.

05:09.960 --> 05:11.736
I mean, there's... there's gotta
be something we can do,

05:11.760 --> 05:13.672
even if we have to think
outside the box.

05:13.760 --> 05:16.036
I do have one more idea.

05:17.320 --> 05:18.320
Van Horn Industries

05:18.400 --> 05:21.040
created a peaceful
anti-riot device

05:21.120 --> 05:23.032
called a Neuro-Stasis
Field Generator.

05:23.120 --> 05:25.430
It's basically a bio-EMP
that can immobilize

05:25.520 --> 05:28.080
any living organism
within a confined radius.

05:28.160 --> 05:31.471
Of course, the few devices
they had built were stolen.

05:31.600 --> 05:34.877
I wouldn't even know where
to begin looking for them.

05:34.960 --> 05:36.679
I do.

05:36.760 --> 05:38.752
Can you at least try
not to look so surprised?

05:38.840 --> 05:42.993
Look, if we need this, uh,
Neo-Matrix whatever it is,

05:43.080 --> 05:46.312
if it's stolen tech,
I think I know where to look.

05:46.400 --> 05:48.437
Earl Cox, Ralph says
you've got some information

05:48.520 --> 05:49.715
that could help us.

05:49.800 --> 05:51.871
Well, turns out, that device
you're looking for

05:51.960 --> 05:54.759
has been circulating
in the underground black market.

05:54.840 --> 05:56.479
Sounds like
Amunet Black's territory.

05:56.560 --> 05:58.677
Eh, Amunet's still MIA.

05:58.760 --> 06:00.319
But believe it or not,
her ex-boyfriend

06:00.400 --> 06:02.073
is filling the void.

06:02.160 --> 06:05.392
You ever heard of Goldface?

06:05.480 --> 06:07.039
Yeah, he's stolen
more weaponized tech

06:07.120 --> 06:08.474
than any criminal in the city.

06:08.560 --> 06:11.234
CCPD's been looking
for his black market for years.

06:11.320 --> 06:13.080
Oh, aye, and they'll
keep on coming up empty.

06:13.160 --> 06:15.197
You pay at the market,
and then poof,

06:15.280 --> 06:18.273
your goods turn up a day later
in an abandoned warehouse.

06:18.360 --> 06:20.317
So by the time
we get what we want...

06:20.440 --> 06:23.035
Goldface will be long gone.

06:23.120 --> 06:24.600
Well, listen, uh,
thanks, Earl.

06:24.680 --> 06:27.400
And, you know, try to eat
some fruit or something.

06:27.480 --> 06:29.551
Oh, will do.

06:29.640 --> 06:31.313
Right, then, gents.
See you around.

06:31.400 --> 06:33.357
Hopefully.

06:33.440 --> 06:34.874
Just tell them
Big Raf sent you.

06:34.960 --> 06:36.519
Thanks for the tip, Earl.

06:41.400 --> 06:42.629
I know what you're thinking.

06:42.720 --> 06:43.880
We're supposed
to pay Goldface

06:43.920 --> 06:45.479
and then just let him get away?

06:45.560 --> 06:47.376
Come on, you said we needed
to think outside the box.

06:47.400 --> 06:48.993
This is making a deal
with the devil.

06:49.080 --> 06:51.072
No, this is stopping Cicada.

06:51.160 --> 06:53.197
Look, I don't like this
any more than you do,

06:53.280 --> 06:55.670
but in some cases,
the ends justify the means.

06:55.760 --> 06:57.752
And stopping a psychotic
meta-killer who we are

06:57.840 --> 07:01.072
literally powerless against,
that's one of those cases.

07:02.400 --> 07:04.153
All right.

07:05.200 --> 07:06.600
What we are doing here?

07:06.680 --> 07:09.036
So Jitters has imported
a brand-new oolong tea,

07:09.120 --> 07:10.496
and it's super rare and I
really want you to try it.

07:10.520 --> 07:12.193
Okay, look,
I'm busy right now.

07:12.280 --> 07:13.696
I'm working, all right?
I don't have time for this.

07:13.720 --> 07:15.256
Well, what are you...
what are you working on?

07:15.280 --> 07:16.736
Well,
I'm working on a mystery,

07:16.760 --> 07:18.319
if you must know,
nosy Parker.

07:18.400 --> 07:21.040
Well, what kind of mystery?

07:21.120 --> 07:23.077
One that maybe I will
tell you before too long,

07:23.160 --> 07:25.470
Nora West-Allen.

07:25.560 --> 07:28.155
Great, so, um,
let's grab a tea, then.

07:28.240 --> 07:30.197
All right, we'll have
one cup of tea.

07:31.640 --> 07:33.313
To go.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.275
<i>Tell me what to do.</i>

07:38.000 --> 07:41.072
It's amazing how malleable
the timeline is.

07:41.160 --> 07:44.631
<i>Even the tiniest refinement
can birth a whole new reality,</i>

07:44.720 --> 07:46.996
<i>an object above placed below.</i>

07:48.720 --> 07:51.758
<i>One path blocked
leads to a whole new one.</i>

07:51.840 --> 07:55.311
<i>And if your timing is right,</i>

07:55.400 --> 07:57.835
<i>everything falls into place.</i>

08:05.440 --> 08:07.318
Keep the change.

08:07.400 --> 08:10.040
Whoo! Oh!

08:11.520 --> 08:13.796
Oh!

08:13.880 --> 08:15.872
- Wow.
- Wow.

08:15.960 --> 08:17.952
That would have been
an embarrassing way to go.

08:18.040 --> 08:19.952
My gosh.
Death by decaf.

08:20.040 --> 08:21.360
Flattened by flat white.

08:21.440 --> 08:23.159
<i>This woman is special.</i>

08:23.240 --> 08:25.709
Help him win her love,
and his attention moves

08:25.800 --> 08:28.235
from you right onto her.

08:28.360 --> 08:30.556
- Renée Adler.
- Ah, Miss Adler.

08:30.640 --> 08:32.756
- Sherloque Wells.
- Can I buy you a scone

08:32.840 --> 08:35.355
or something to repay you
for saving my life?

08:35.440 --> 08:37.750
Scone? Yes, all night.
I mean yes.

08:37.840 --> 08:38.895
- Great.
- Thank you very much.

08:38.919 --> 08:41.230
Um, uh...

08:41.320 --> 08:42.736
What we shall talk about
while we eat our scones,

08:42.760 --> 08:44.399
- I wonder?
- Oh.

08:44.480 --> 08:46.320
Maybe about, given your grace
and your posture,

08:46.360 --> 08:48.238
your years of ballet training?

08:49.640 --> 08:51.313
- Since I was four.
- Hmm.

08:51.400 --> 08:53.437
Wow, you're really
perceptive.

08:53.520 --> 08:56.080
Well, it's a modest talent,
I suppose.

08:56.160 --> 08:57.753
Notice anything else
about me?

08:57.840 --> 08:59.638
Challenge accepted.

08:59.720 --> 09:03.600
Um, well, East Coast girl?

09:03.680 --> 09:05.080
Yes.

09:05.160 --> 09:08.551
From a small village,
maybe, um, by a bay?

09:08.640 --> 09:10.950
Work with books?
A librarian?

09:11.040 --> 09:12.520
At a university?

09:12.600 --> 09:14.910
Live by a train station,
small split-level pad?

09:15.000 --> 09:16.992
You, um, have a dog.
Older dog.

09:17.080 --> 09:18.400
Corgi.
Anyway, about that scone...

09:18.480 --> 09:20.199
- Okay, stay away from me.
- What?

09:20.280 --> 09:22.511
I don't know how long
you've been watching me,

09:22.600 --> 09:24.034
- but it ends now.
- No, no, no.

09:24.120 --> 09:26.157
Or I'm calling CCPD, stalker.

09:26.240 --> 09:30.120
No, uh, Miss Adler.
I...

09:30.200 --> 09:31.839
- Sherlock!
- Sherloque.

09:31.920 --> 09:33.400
Why did you say
all that stuff to her?

09:33.440 --> 09:35.079
You know,
skip the small talk, no?

09:35.160 --> 09:37.072
- No.
- I have work to do.

09:37.160 --> 09:39.994
No, no, no, um, I just... I'm
not really a romance expert,

09:40.080 --> 09:42.356
but I just feel like you
were really into her.

09:43.680 --> 09:45.160
Well, yes, maybe
a little into her.

09:45.240 --> 09:48.074
Okay, so don't give up
so fast, you know?

09:48.160 --> 09:50.629
Maybe you could, um, try
to find a way to say "I'm sorry"

09:50.720 --> 09:52.996
and I could help you with that.

09:53.080 --> 09:54.719
How could one say no to that?

09:56.920 --> 09:58.832
All right, we're approaching
the position.

09:58.920 --> 10:00.070
<i>Copy.</i>

10:00.200 --> 10:01.936
These are the coordinates
of the black market.

10:01.960 --> 10:03.456
Team Snow and Frost
are standing by for backup.

10:06.520 --> 10:09.513
Okay.
What do we do now?

10:10.520 --> 10:12.079
I guess we say
the magic words.

10:12.160 --> 10:15.278
The streets are
paved with gold.

10:17.840 --> 10:19.136
Maybe you didn't
say it loud enou...

10:26.320 --> 10:28.357
Barry? Ralph?

10:28.480 --> 10:29.834
Uh...

10:39.800 --> 10:41.439
Meta cuffs?

10:42.720 --> 10:44.996
That's right,
power-dampening cuffs

10:45.120 --> 10:47.032
fitted with an explosive charge

10:47.120 --> 10:48.600
in case you're both metas.

10:48.680 --> 10:51.991
- So tell me, who sent you?
- That's really sweet.

10:52.080 --> 10:54.117
Look how threatening
they're trying to be.

10:54.200 --> 10:56.635
Boys, uh...

10:56.720 --> 11:00.077
We really appreciate all this,
but you can relax.

11:00.160 --> 11:01.480
Big Raf sent us.

11:02.680 --> 11:04.160
Big Raf, huh?

11:04.240 --> 11:06.072
All right, then.

11:06.160 --> 11:09.119
Gentlemen,
welcome to the market.

11:18.560 --> 11:23.476
So nobody, including us,
knows where we are right now.

11:23.560 --> 11:25.950
And we are
totally powerless.

11:26.080 --> 11:27.576
Dude, if we make
the wrong move in here,

11:27.600 --> 11:30.877
these cuffs are gonna be
the least of our worries.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.673
New game plan.

11:32.760 --> 11:35.912
The antihero of our dynamic duo
will find the Field Generator.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.674
And you're just gonna stay here
and try not to look like a cop.

11:38.800 --> 11:40.519
- Or a superhero.
- Okay.

11:40.600 --> 11:42.000
Or really anything
you actually are.

11:42.080 --> 11:44.720
Just go.
I'm fine.

11:45.280 --> 11:46.714
Hey.

11:46.800 --> 11:48.393
You look like
a discerning consumer.

11:48.480 --> 11:50.160
Might I interest you
in a little firepower?

11:50.200 --> 11:52.192
- No, I'm good.
- Come to a weapons market

11:52.280 --> 11:53.680
and you don't want any weapons?

11:53.760 --> 11:56.116
I said I'm good.
I'm here for something special.

11:56.200 --> 11:59.557
What's more special
than a CCPD killer?

11:59.640 --> 12:00.710
What do you mean?

12:00.800 --> 12:02.056
That's what's great
about these babies.

12:02.080 --> 12:04.390
Burn through police-issued
body armor.

12:04.480 --> 12:07.951
I call them toastmasters.
Try it for yourself.

12:27.520 --> 12:30.080
Can't wait to see cops' faces
when these hit the streets.

12:30.160 --> 12:32.595
Or what's left of their faces.

12:35.600 --> 12:38.957
- How much for all of them?
- Uh, all of them?

12:39.040 --> 12:41.191
There's a limit per customer.

12:41.320 --> 12:43.277
I guess I could ask
Goldface for approval.

12:43.360 --> 12:46.432
No, why don't we just
work this out between us?

12:48.320 --> 12:50.710
How much will it cost to take
all these off your hands?

13:00.240 --> 13:02.197
Thank you for meeting
with me, Mr. Osmack.

13:02.280 --> 13:04.875
Oh, call me Brent.
And it's no problem.

13:04.960 --> 13:07.270
Any interview about union
reform is time well spent.

13:07.360 --> 13:09.079
What about workers' opinions?

13:09.160 --> 13:11.056
I imagine, as a manager,
you must get them all the time.

13:11.080 --> 13:13.160
Yeah, I know most of my guys
better than their wives.

13:14.600 --> 13:16.114
So I guess
it must be difficult

13:16.200 --> 13:18.510
when one of them
surprises you.

13:18.600 --> 13:21.320
Like that, um... that killer
that everyone's talking about,

13:21.400 --> 13:22.993
Orlin Dwyer.

13:23.080 --> 13:26.278
Did he ever say anything that
indicated how he was feeling

13:26.360 --> 13:28.795
or what he was up to?

13:28.880 --> 13:30.314
No comment.

13:30.400 --> 13:33.154
Okay, well, did he give you
any kind of clue about

13:33.240 --> 13:35.630
- where he might be now?
- I said no comment.

13:35.720 --> 13:37.279
Did he threaten you?

13:37.360 --> 13:39.113
Look, I know you're scared.

13:39.200 --> 13:42.432
A lot of people were scared
when DeVoe attacked last year.

13:42.520 --> 13:44.352
But the Flash defeated him,

13:44.440 --> 13:46.909
partially because I wrote
these articles that encouraged

13:47.000 --> 13:48.957
people to come forward
with information.

13:49.040 --> 13:51.680
We can stop Dwyer.

13:54.640 --> 13:57.997
Okay, his paychecks
went to a P.O. box.

13:58.080 --> 14:00.016
But there was a problem once,
and I had to forward

14:00.040 --> 14:01.918
to his cousin's house.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.993
Uh, his name was, uh,
Robbie something.

14:05.080 --> 14:08.198
Robbie... Robbie Byrne.

14:08.280 --> 14:09.430
That's great.

14:11.640 --> 14:13.456
I'm telling you, man,
I don't have the authority

14:13.480 --> 14:15.056
- to okay a purchase that large.
- Uh, listen...

14:15.080 --> 14:17.231
Excuse me, um, Bartholomew,
a word?

14:17.320 --> 14:19.118
Just a word, yeah.

14:21.200 --> 14:22.680
What the hell are you doing?

14:22.760 --> 14:25.480
Okay, this guy has got crates
of cop-killing guns.

14:25.560 --> 14:27.176
Would you prefer
he sells them to criminals?

14:27.200 --> 14:29.032
I would prefer that you
not blow our cover,

14:29.120 --> 14:31.396
and you're going
to blow our cover.

14:31.480 --> 14:32.856
Come on, man,
I asked you to turn off

14:32.880 --> 14:34.633
hero mode for, like,
ten minutes.

14:34.720 --> 14:36.040
Okay, all right, whatever.

14:36.120 --> 14:37.256
Let's not argue
about this here, all right?

14:37.280 --> 14:38.536
Did you find
the Field Generator?

14:38.560 --> 14:39.710
Of course I did.

14:39.800 --> 14:42.190
But you're not gonna
like who has it.

14:42.280 --> 14:44.237
<i>♪♪ You see these
invisible borders ♪♪</i>

14:44.360 --> 14:46.480

14:52.840 --> 14:55.309
What up? What up?
And welcome.

14:55.400 --> 14:57.232
I hear something special
in my collection's

14:57.320 --> 14:59.391
- caught your attention.
- You heard right.

14:59.480 --> 15:01.711
- The Neuro-Stasis...
- Neuro-Stasis Field Generator?

15:01.800 --> 15:04.110
It's a nasty bit of business,
if used properly.

15:04.200 --> 15:06.400
There's nothing proper about
the way we're gonna use it.

15:06.480 --> 15:07.755
My kind of people.

15:07.840 --> 15:10.116
Okay. Let's chop it up.

15:10.200 --> 15:12.078
Let's make a deal.

15:15.720 --> 15:16.856
Look, we gonna do a deal
or what?

15:16.880 --> 15:17.880
Shut your mouth.

15:19.320 --> 15:20.959
Unless you wanna be one-handed.

15:30.280 --> 15:32.272
Thought not.

15:32.360 --> 15:33.999
See, here's the thing.

15:34.080 --> 15:37.960
Scum recognizes scum.

15:38.080 --> 15:39.639
I'm scum.

15:39.720 --> 15:43.191
And I've survived this long
by recognizing the same.

15:43.280 --> 15:45.192
Like you.
You're scum.

15:45.280 --> 15:47.192
I sniffed you coming
a mile away.

15:47.280 --> 15:48.600
Thanks?

15:49.160 --> 15:51.720
But your partner,
I don't sniff nothing on him.

15:51.800 --> 15:54.838
And that worries me.

15:54.920 --> 15:58.800
So the question is...

16:00.600 --> 16:01.829
Who are you?

16:02.880 --> 16:04.376
Well, I can vouch for him.
He's just...

16:04.400 --> 16:05.959
I said shut your mouth!

16:11.040 --> 16:14.750
I wanna hear it from him.

16:25.160 --> 16:28.836
I'm only gonna ask once more.

16:28.920 --> 16:32.470
Who are you?

16:35.680 --> 16:37.831
I'm nobody.

16:37.920 --> 16:39.673
No arrests.

16:39.760 --> 16:41.592
No convictions.

16:41.680 --> 16:43.558
Not for the Star City Museum
heist

16:43.640 --> 16:45.916
where atomized lorazepam
knocked the guards out

16:46.000 --> 16:48.196
or the acid bomb that blew open

16:48.280 --> 16:50.431
the Federal Reserve
vault last month.

16:50.520 --> 16:51.636
That was you?

16:51.720 --> 16:53.359
Not according
to police reports.

16:53.440 --> 16:55.875
Because the only evidence
I leave behind are red herrings

16:55.960 --> 16:57.838
for idiot cops to chase down.

16:57.920 --> 17:00.389
You wanna know who I am?

17:00.480 --> 17:03.120
You can call me the Chemist.

17:03.200 --> 17:06.989
But I really don't care
what you call me.

17:08.440 --> 17:10.113
Just stop wasting my time.

17:19.359 --> 17:21.715
You should let him
do the talking.

17:21.800 --> 17:25.031
Yeah, I get that a lot.
Uh, so we back in business?

17:26.440 --> 17:28.271
With a twist.

17:30.480 --> 17:32.392
Got a big job tonight.

17:32.480 --> 17:33.994
Could use a guy
like the Chemist

17:34.080 --> 17:36.311
to cover our tracks.

17:36.400 --> 17:37.834
You help me get what I want,

17:37.920 --> 17:39.479
I'll give you what you want.

17:39.560 --> 17:41.233
And what exactly
do you want?

17:41.320 --> 17:44.392
Ivo Labs has this
cutting-edge 3-D printer.

17:44.480 --> 17:45.834
Sold it to some hospital.

17:45.920 --> 17:47.718
What's so special
about a 3-D printer?

17:47.800 --> 17:50.269
This one prints
artificial organs.

17:50.360 --> 17:54.479
If I've got it, I can sell life
to the highest bidder.

17:54.560 --> 17:56.552
You want us
to rob a hospital?

17:56.640 --> 18:00.236
Of course not.
I'm not a monster.

18:00.320 --> 18:02.755
I want you to rob the lab
before it ever gets

18:02.840 --> 18:04.320
to the hospital.

18:05.560 --> 18:07.472
Smile, boys.

18:07.560 --> 18:09.870
Tonight you're working
for Goldface.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.871
Best birthday present ever,
Ralph.

20:01.640 --> 20:03.472
<i>- Allô!</i>
- Oh, good, you're here.

20:03.560 --> 20:06.075
So since you let me agree to
help you with your love life...

20:06.160 --> 20:07.230
Right.

20:07.320 --> 20:10.438
I came up with
an unusual idea.

20:10.560 --> 20:11.960
- Spectacular.
- Mm-hmm.

20:12.040 --> 20:13.997
I have asked your
ex-wives for help.

20:14.080 --> 20:15.080
Great. What?

20:15.160 --> 20:17.197
Five women married you
for a reason.

20:17.280 --> 20:20.034
So who better to ask why
they fell in love with you

20:20.120 --> 20:21.395
- than them?
- Okay, except...

20:21.480 --> 20:22.976
I didn't think any
of them would agree,

20:23.000 --> 20:24.878
but four of them actually
jumped at the chance.

20:24.960 --> 20:26.056
- Of course they did.
- Mm-hmm.

20:26.080 --> 20:27.560
Because I owe them money.

20:27.640 --> 20:29.597
I'm behind on all
the alimony payments,

20:29.680 --> 20:31.876
and they don't know
what Earth I'm on, until now.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.036
- What?
- That's right.

20:40.920 --> 20:43.071
Hello, Detective.

20:43.160 --> 20:45.197
Hello, <i>chérie.</i>

20:45.280 --> 20:49.399
You married the same
woman seven times?

20:49.480 --> 20:51.870
Well, she's the one for me.

20:51.960 --> 20:53.474
Darling, you can't
run forever.

20:53.560 --> 20:55.096
- We'll always find you.
- You're in violation

20:55.120 --> 20:57.430
- of alimony order 1152.
- Time to pay up!

20:57.520 --> 20:59.432
- Ladies.
- We know you had Superman

20:59.520 --> 21:01.716
deliver your alimony
to your ex on Earth-38.

21:01.800 --> 21:05.032
- What?
- You think we don't all talk?

21:05.120 --> 21:06.839
I was hoping
they don't all talk.

21:06.920 --> 21:08.216
Oh, no, we talk.
We get together all the time.

21:08.240 --> 21:09.440
- We have to talk.
- Oh, we do.

21:09.480 --> 21:11.073
Except I can never
get you on the phone.

21:11.160 --> 21:12.913
- I text.
- Mm.

21:13.040 --> 21:15.839
Look, I understand.
You want your money, right?

21:15.960 --> 21:20.159
So maybe we can... maybe we can
come to an agreement, hmm?

21:20.240 --> 21:22.118
We had an agreement,
one that you're currently

21:22.200 --> 21:23.759
- in breach of.
- Uh...

21:23.840 --> 21:25.354
Uh, ladies.

21:25.440 --> 21:27.955
Ladies, just a big
misunderstanding here.

21:28.040 --> 21:29.759
Big misunderstanding.

21:29.840 --> 21:31.096
I thought you were all
coming here

21:31.120 --> 21:32.376
- to help Sherloque.
- Sherloque.

21:32.400 --> 21:33.993
Help him?

21:34.080 --> 21:36.056
You can't help a man who
thinks he knows everything.

21:36.080 --> 21:39.152
Yeah, like the time clues led
him to believe it'd be romantic

21:39.240 --> 21:40.913
to release fruit bats
at our wedding.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.196
It's because she support
the endangered species,

21:43.320 --> 21:45.471
so I say fruit bat.

21:45.560 --> 21:47.233
I do.
I was being thoughtful.

21:47.320 --> 21:49.755
Oh, for our anniversary,
he bought me a puppy dog.

21:49.840 --> 21:51.696
That's... that's not really...
That's kind of nice.

21:51.720 --> 21:52.949
Thank you.

21:53.080 --> 21:54.673
I am deathly allergic
to puppy dogs.

21:54.760 --> 21:56.656
The dander makes my throat
just...

21:56.680 --> 21:59.036
It's true, but studies
show that more exposure

21:59.120 --> 22:01.237
to the allergens, it builds up
your immune system,

22:01.320 --> 22:02.496
so I'm trying to give you
a healthy life.

22:02.520 --> 22:04.193
Again, thoughtful on my part.

22:04.280 --> 22:06.840
Well, at least he didn't
deduce that the nicest way

22:06.920 --> 22:09.196
to break up with you
was to fake his own death.

22:09.280 --> 22:11.317
- Ooh.
- Not so thoughtful.

22:11.400 --> 22:13.551
Twice!

22:13.640 --> 22:15.996
Oh, that last one
really was on you, dear.

22:16.080 --> 22:18.356
Yeah, seriously.

22:18.480 --> 22:20.711
Look, there's gonna be
a real death here

22:20.800 --> 22:22.917
if you don't pay us
our money back next month

22:23.000 --> 22:24.832
with interest.

22:24.920 --> 22:26.673
We know where you are now.

22:26.760 --> 22:28.638
Plus, we got a great
alimony recovery agent

22:28.720 --> 22:31.189
by the name of Breacher.

22:31.280 --> 22:33.397
Breacher?

22:33.480 --> 22:34.800
Ticktock, Sherlock.

22:34.880 --> 22:37.236
Sherloque.
Where you're going?

22:38.760 --> 22:41.639
- Sherloque.
- Oh, I like how you say it.

22:41.720 --> 22:44.280
I don't mean
to sound heartless,

22:44.360 --> 22:48.354
but, darling, not everyone
is meant for a relationship.

22:48.440 --> 22:51.911
Some people are just
destined to be alone.

22:59.840 --> 23:01.559
Sherloque, I...

23:21.360 --> 23:22.760
We roll out in five.

23:27.360 --> 23:30.319
Look, uh, I don't have
to ask you

23:30.400 --> 23:32.232
how you feel about this.

23:32.320 --> 23:36.030
Stealing from a hospital,
that's...

23:36.120 --> 23:39.192
That's way more
than we bargained for.

23:39.280 --> 23:41.078
So if you don't want
to do this, I'm...

23:41.160 --> 23:43.516
I'll do it.

23:43.600 --> 23:45.034
You will?

23:45.120 --> 23:46.679
Yeah, what choice do I have?

23:46.760 --> 23:48.880
You warned me to get my head
on straight for this job,

23:48.960 --> 23:50.110
and I didn't.

23:50.240 --> 23:52.357
You had Goldface ready
to give us what we needed,

23:52.440 --> 23:55.319
and I blew it trying to get
those guns off the street,

23:55.400 --> 23:57.790
and here we are.

23:57.880 --> 24:00.270
Barry,
this is not your fault.

24:00.360 --> 24:01.794
Yeah, it is.

24:02.400 --> 24:03.516
And you were right.

24:03.600 --> 24:05.751
If I wanna stop Cicada,
I can't be so precious

24:05.880 --> 24:08.111
about getting
the Flash's hands dirty.

24:08.200 --> 24:10.317
Sometimes the ends
justify the means.

24:10.400 --> 24:12.835
I get that now.

24:12.920 --> 24:14.479
Let's just get this over with.

24:56.640 --> 24:58.074
Who the hell are you?

25:00.800 --> 25:04.077
Sorry, um, the door
was unlocked.

25:04.160 --> 25:06.311
I'm a reporter.
I'm...

25:06.440 --> 25:09.672
Uh, I'm looking for the owner,
Robbie Byrne.

25:16.400 --> 25:17.993
I'm Robbie.

25:28.680 --> 25:31.070
So...

25:31.160 --> 25:34.153
what kind of story you writing?

25:34.240 --> 25:37.916
It's an investigative
report about

25:38.760 --> 25:41.070
lead leaking
into the water pipes

25:41.160 --> 25:42.753
in this neighborhood.

25:43.960 --> 25:46.475
Is that so?

25:46.560 --> 25:50.031
Yeah.
Um, yeah.

25:50.120 --> 25:52.430
And it would be, um, very
helpful if you could answer

25:52.520 --> 25:55.479
a few questions for me.

25:55.560 --> 25:58.359
All right.

25:58.440 --> 26:01.717
But I haven't noticed
anything strange in the water.

26:01.800 --> 26:03.280
That's the scary thing
about lead.

26:03.360 --> 26:05.096
I mean, the first sign
would probably be a trip

26:05.120 --> 26:06.554
to the hospital.

26:06.640 --> 26:09.951
Young children are
especially susceptible.

26:10.040 --> 26:12.635
Do you have a daughter?

26:16.920 --> 26:19.037
I used to.

26:21.680 --> 26:25.037
I'm sorry to hear that.

26:25.120 --> 26:27.112
And what about you?

26:27.200 --> 26:28.998
Me?

26:29.080 --> 26:30.912
I'm feeling better than ever.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.037
Well, lead poisoning
can present itself

26:33.120 --> 26:35.954
- in a variety of ways.
- Look, it's late.

26:36.040 --> 26:38.271
And I've got to get
to bed soon, so...

26:38.360 --> 26:40.272
Of course, Mr. Byrne.
I understand.

26:40.360 --> 26:43.114
Um, I still have
a few more questions.

26:43.200 --> 26:45.954
I mean, I could always come
to your office tomorrow,

26:46.080 --> 26:48.197
if you like.

26:48.280 --> 26:51.637
Would you prefer I see you
tomorrow, then?

26:53.520 --> 26:55.000
No.

26:57.280 --> 26:59.431
Let's finish this now.

27:06.120 --> 27:07.793
Making tea?

27:07.880 --> 27:10.111
No, making an espresso
because the mind

27:10.200 --> 27:11.680
needs more caffeine.

27:11.760 --> 27:13.911
Um, that's just hot water.

27:14.000 --> 27:17.152
No, no, it...

27:17.280 --> 27:18.760
<i>Nom de Dieu.</i>

27:20.720 --> 27:23.076
Sherloque, you know
that stuff your ex-wife said

27:23.200 --> 27:24.998
isn't true, right?

27:25.120 --> 27:28.158
No, I'm destined to be alone.

27:28.240 --> 27:31.597
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

27:31.680 --> 27:32.830
Listen.

27:32.960 --> 27:36.636
You treat love like it's
a mystery that can be solved.

27:36.720 --> 27:40.396
But you can't deduce your way
to a happy ending.

27:41.440 --> 27:46.356
You just have to let it come
one step at a time

27:46.440 --> 27:48.716
and enjoy whatever step
you're in.

28:13.040 --> 28:14.554
Okay, listen up.

28:14.640 --> 28:15.710
Get in, get out.

28:15.800 --> 28:18.076
Our guy on the inside
said the place is empty,

28:18.160 --> 28:20.755
and you all have the code
and the pass cards.

28:20.840 --> 28:23.833
Switch your weapons from stun
to meet your maker.

28:25.440 --> 28:26.715
Let's go.

28:28.560 --> 28:30.597
Go.

28:44.240 --> 28:45.674
Barry, let me check
your rifle.

28:45.760 --> 28:47.797
I think it needs a new clip.
What?

28:47.880 --> 28:49.256
Left my phone in there.
Can you check for me?

28:49.280 --> 28:51.078
We gotta...

28:51.880 --> 28:53.314
Clear.
Move, move, move.

28:53.400 --> 28:55.039
Ralph, there's no phone, man.
There's...

28:56.320 --> 28:58.312
What are you doing?
Hey, hey!

28:58.400 --> 28:59.959
What are you... Ralph!

29:00.040 --> 29:01.474
You're right, Barry.

29:01.560 --> 29:03.517
- Flash doesn't have to do this.
- What?

29:03.600 --> 29:05.319
But I can.

29:06.320 --> 29:07.320
Ralph.

29:07.400 --> 29:08.595
Hey, hey!

29:08.680 --> 29:10.319
Ralph, let me out!

29:10.400 --> 29:13.552
I can back you up, man!

29:13.640 --> 29:15.199
Don't go alone!

29:15.280 --> 29:17.158
Ralph!

29:17.240 --> 29:18.833
Ralph.

29:18.920 --> 29:21.799
I can have your back, man!
Don't go alone!

29:31.360 --> 29:32.555
Where's the Chemist?

29:32.640 --> 29:34.836
He said something about us
leaving an orgy of evidence

29:34.920 --> 29:36.673
in the truck.
He's handling it.

30:03.240 --> 30:04.993
All right,
fan out and search.

30:05.080 --> 30:07.549
Signal back when you find it.

30:34.640 --> 30:36.711
Hey, anonymous
criminal colleague,

30:36.800 --> 30:38.553
this is it.

30:42.120 --> 30:44.157
Kind of overkill
with the packaging.

30:51.280 --> 30:52.919
Yo, this ain't a library, man.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.832
You wanna give me a hand?

30:54.920 --> 30:57.196
Yeah, how about two?

31:00.680 --> 31:01.955
Sorry, not sorry, pal.

31:02.040 --> 31:04.191
This baby's going
to a hospital.

31:04.280 --> 31:07.273
Honestly, I never liked you.

31:07.360 --> 31:10.797
Take this trash out
to the truck for disposal.

31:10.880 --> 31:12.200
And his friend too.

31:12.280 --> 31:14.112
Come on, come on.

31:16.320 --> 31:17.834
All right, let's pack it up.

31:17.920 --> 31:19.070
Chop-chop.

31:41.960 --> 31:43.599
Brick!

31:43.680 --> 31:44.716
Ralph!

31:46.960 --> 31:49.316
Oh!

31:49.400 --> 31:50.576
Well, thank you,
but for the record,

31:50.600 --> 31:52.034
I meant throw the brick to me.

31:52.120 --> 31:53.679
I was trying
to throw it to you.

31:55.320 --> 31:57.880
I see you couldn't
go through with it either.

31:59.360 --> 32:00.840
Not after I saw
those little kids.

32:00.920 --> 32:02.354
Carver's in there
with the printer.

32:02.480 --> 32:04.631
There's a lot of guns.
We don't have any powers.

32:06.080 --> 32:08.072
But these do have
a stun setting.

32:09.640 --> 32:11.632
Come on.

32:16.400 --> 32:19.916
All in a day's work, people.

32:20.040 --> 32:22.316
- Cover me!
- Break, break, break!

32:22.400 --> 32:24.960
Get down! Watch it!
Go, go, go, go!

33:51.640 --> 33:54.678

Now.</i>

33:54.800 --> 33:56.075
Go.

34:04.040 --> 34:06.191
Good boys.

34:06.280 --> 34:08.715
I was hoping you wouldn't
make Daddy use his belt.

34:11.280 --> 34:13.351
Since you obeyed me,

34:14.159 --> 34:16.675
I'm not gonna
blow your arms off.

34:16.760 --> 34:18.478
I'm gonna kill you

34:18.560 --> 34:20.755
in a more traditional way.

34:22.159 --> 34:23.560
And I prom...

34:31.520 --> 34:34.274
He really should have
frisked us first.

34:43.159 --> 34:46.197
See, that's the thing...
my gold...

34:51.520 --> 34:53.398
It don't just make me
look pretty.

35:32.800 --> 35:34.951
All right, Goldie Hawn.
Let's do this.

35:38.080 --> 35:40.914
Since I'm going into
the organ donor business,

35:41.000 --> 35:43.231
you'll be happy to know
that your corpses are going

35:43.320 --> 35:45.596
to a good cause:

35:46.400 --> 35:47.516
Making me rich.

35:53.120 --> 35:57.000
Hey!
Why you so mad at him?

35:57.080 --> 36:00.232
He's not the one that made you
fall for a fake backstory.

36:03.240 --> 36:06.233
Goldface, huh?
More like Fool's Gold.

36:23.840 --> 36:26.355
Good thing he didn't know
this wasn't loaded.

36:34.360 --> 36:36.750
He's alive.

36:36.880 --> 36:39.031
Yeah, and so are we.

36:39.120 --> 36:40.918
Thanks to you.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.354
The Chemist?

36:46.240 --> 36:48.596
Well, I, um...
I should get going.

36:48.680 --> 36:51.514
Thank you so much.
I really appreciate it.

36:58.280 --> 37:02.240
You didn't have that bag
when you came in here.

37:46.240 --> 37:49.472
We're gonna beat you.

37:58.720 --> 38:00.154
Well, you got
pretty banged up,

38:00.240 --> 38:02.550
but your powers are already
working their magic.

38:02.640 --> 38:04.233
No signs of permanent damage.

38:04.320 --> 38:06.596
Guess the only real loss
today was our mission.

38:06.720 --> 38:07.915
Yeah.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.799
No, we'll find another way
to get the Field Generator.

38:10.880 --> 38:13.952
And besides, we did have
another win today.

38:14.040 --> 38:17.556
We took down a powerful
meta-human without our powers.

38:17.640 --> 38:19.916
That's a good reminder that
even when Cicada dampens us,

38:20.000 --> 38:22.879
we have other ways to fight.

38:25.480 --> 38:27.278
Hello?

38:27.360 --> 38:28.794
Iris?

38:34.400 --> 38:36.073
Dwyer's gone.

38:36.160 --> 38:37.640
I'll get Iris.

38:42.200 --> 38:43.953
I got nothing in here.
Ditto upstairs.

38:44.040 --> 38:45.176
Yeah, there's
no evidence here

38:45.200 --> 38:46.395
that points to where he went.

38:46.480 --> 38:48.392
Did you find that
device you needed?

38:51.640 --> 38:53.313
Maybe we don't need it.

38:59.960 --> 39:01.952
I know how to give
the cure to Cicada.

39:03.960 --> 39:05.440
I know his weakness.

39:09.080 --> 39:10.639
Uh, <i>pardon.</i>

39:10.720 --> 39:12.200
- May I offer you a refill?
- Oh, God.

39:12.280 --> 39:13.634
No, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait.

39:13.720 --> 39:15.296
I need to tell you something.
Don't be alarmed.

39:15.320 --> 39:18.154
I am not a stalker.
I'm a detective.

39:18.240 --> 39:21.551
This is how I knew
all these facts about you.

39:21.640 --> 39:23.871
I deduced them.

39:23.960 --> 39:28.079
It's immodest to say, but I
happen to be quite good at it.

39:28.160 --> 39:30.994
- Prove it.
<i>- Pardon?</i>

39:31.080 --> 39:33.959
Show me.
Do, um...

39:35.720 --> 39:37.120
Do that guy.

39:40.120 --> 39:43.238
- Challenge accepted.
- Great.

39:43.320 --> 39:47.678
So if you look at the size
of his drink,

39:47.760 --> 39:50.070
small relative
to his body mass.

39:50.160 --> 39:53.392
And the hesitation but also
the enjoyment with which

39:53.480 --> 39:55.949
he consumes his beverage,
it's elementary.

39:56.080 --> 39:58.879
This is a man
who has a dairy allergy

39:58.960 --> 40:02.158
but still prefers
to drink milk lattes,

40:02.240 --> 40:03.515
but not without consequence.

40:03.600 --> 40:06.069
Oh, wait for it.
And...

40:09.120 --> 40:10.759
- Oh.
<i>- Et voilà.</i>

40:10.840 --> 40:13.275
- Oh, my gosh.
- Mm.

40:13.360 --> 40:16.398
- You are really good at this.
- What can I say?

40:16.480 --> 40:19.712
It is a modest talent.
But I must apologize for...

40:19.800 --> 40:22.190
how do they say...
creeping you out.

40:22.280 --> 40:26.638
But if perhaps you would allow
yourself to forgive me,

40:26.720 --> 40:30.350
then I could buy you a tea
to make it up to you.

40:31.640 --> 40:33.393
Well, I have to go
to work now.

40:33.480 --> 40:35.153
Ah, all right, no.
But... but I...

40:35.240 --> 40:38.551
- Yes, of course.
- You can call me sometime.

40:38.640 --> 40:39.640
Really?

40:39.720 --> 40:40.915
Well...

40:43.080 --> 40:44.833
- Ah, <i>merci.</i>
- Mm.

40:44.960 --> 40:46.917
I look forward to,
um, sometime.

40:47.000 --> 40:48.000
Me too.

40:48.080 --> 40:49.992
- Mm. So...
- Thanks.

40:50.080 --> 40:51.309
Whoa, oh!

40:51.400 --> 40:52.754
- Oh, you all right?
- Oh, gosh.

40:52.840 --> 40:54.136
I guess I should have
started ballet

40:54.160 --> 40:55.230
when I was three,
right?

40:55.320 --> 40:56.720
- Of course, yes.
- Whoo!

40:56.800 --> 41:00.555
- Okay, bye.
<i>- Au revoir,</i> Miss Adler.

41:02.880 --> 41:04.473
Ah, you're amazing.

41:13.280 --> 41:14.680
You're a meta.

41:19.160 --> 41:20.560
Computer on.

41:22.880 --> 41:24.758
Close Nora West-Allen file.

41:24.840 --> 41:26.559
Open Cicada casework.

41:28.160 --> 41:30.038
All right.

41:32.240 --> 41:34.232
He will not harm you.

41:47.720 --> 41:49.677
<i>If your mission
is successful,</i>

41:50.400 --> 41:52.960
your secret is safe.

41:53.040 --> 41:56.477
And you and I are free
to continue what we started.

42:20.000 --> 42:21.400
<i>Greg, move your head.</i>
