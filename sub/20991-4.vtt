WEBVTT

00:42.200 --> 00:44.359
I told you to stay
the fuck out of this !

01:10.159 --> 01:12.359
I'd like to report assault
and battery.

01:14.920 --> 01:18.519
On the corner of Święta Barbara
and Poznańska.

01:20.719 --> 01:22.640
All right, but hurry up, please.

03:22.599 --> 03:24.919
PAKT
Episode 4

03:32.840 --> 03:35.360
No, we won't do it.
Too little evidence.

03:35.439 --> 03:38.080
- Andrzej, the press is waiting.
- We have a problem then.

03:38.159 --> 03:41.520
I was the one to bring the tapes.
The transcript is powerful.

03:41.919 --> 03:44.599
- So who's behind it ?
- It is not our job to...

03:44.680 --> 03:46.439
Then fucking what ?

03:47.439 --> 03:50.919
So what is our job, Monika ?
You're completely nuts !

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
- You been drinking ?
- What's this got to do with anything ?

03:56.120 --> 03:57.240
What's going on ?

03:59.599 --> 04:01.680
Andrzej doesn't want
to run the transcript.

04:01.759 --> 04:03.800
- Why not ?
- Because it's fake.

04:03.879 --> 04:06.439
Andrzej believes
we should check it once again.

04:06.520 --> 04:09.840
- It's a newspaper's duty to...
- Stop bullshitting !

04:12.800 --> 04:15.800
If this story runs
in tomorrow's issue, I'll quit.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.439
Call the press
to start the machines.

04:26.839 --> 04:28.439
Monika, write the Editor's Note.

04:30.519 --> 04:31.879
Get down to work, now !

05:19.279 --> 05:20.240
Thank you.

05:22.120 --> 05:24.160
I need to keep you here
for observation.

05:24.720 --> 05:26.240
I have no time for that, Doctor.

05:27.800 --> 05:29.879
- Here you are.
- What is this ?

05:30.800 --> 05:32.360
Two fractured ribs,

05:32.800 --> 05:36.720
plus suspected concussion
and an overall body trauma.

05:38.079 --> 05:39.759
What can I do ?
Pressure of work.

05:40.079 --> 05:41.920
- Do you feel sick ?
- Yes.

05:42.360 --> 05:45.519
- So you really should stay.
- Need to take this, excuse me.

05:48.839 --> 05:49.879
Hi.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.319
He wasn't supposed
to go anywhere ! Fuck !

05:56.439 --> 05:58.000
All right, I'm sorry, hold on.

05:58.399 --> 06:00.399
I'll handle this.
I'll call you back in a second.

06:03.399 --> 06:06.399
- I have to go.
- Take the X-rays.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.160
No need to, thank you.

06:12.480 --> 06:14.519
- And ?
- Kuba's gone missing.

06:15.480 --> 06:17.480
- What ?
- Kuba's gone missing.

06:19.120 --> 06:22.199
Hospital, yes.
As fast as you can.

06:34.839 --> 06:36.000
Something's wrong ?

06:39.000 --> 06:41.959
- Get in.
- We'll wait, thanks.

06:44.560 --> 06:46.879
- We might have a chat at last.
- What about ?

06:48.480 --> 06:51.120
For example, your performance
at the Warsaw Business Club.

06:51.720 --> 06:53.680
How the fuck
do you know about it ?

06:55.639 --> 06:57.600
- Get in.
- Thanks. Come on.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
It's Mum.

07:26.439 --> 07:27.680
No, I won't tell you.

07:31.120 --> 07:32.120
I'm OK.

07:36.120 --> 07:37.800
Don't call me for some time, OK ?

07:47.800 --> 07:50.199
- He's out of range.
- His signal's gone.

07:57.839 --> 07:58.759
Hi.

08:00.160 --> 08:02.560
That's good.
Did he say where he was ?

08:05.199 --> 08:08.920
Ewa, calm down. Give him some time,
I'm sure he'll be back.

08:10.560 --> 08:13.360
Please, calm down.
We'll be in touch, bye.

08:15.079 --> 08:17.600
The snot picked up
but didn't say where he was.

08:17.680 --> 08:18.959
Look what I've found.

08:19.399 --> 08:21.959
The car is registered
in the name of Grzegorz Merta.

08:22.399 --> 08:24.800
- Address ?
- Cisowa 16.

08:27.680 --> 08:29.079
A businessman ?

08:29.160 --> 08:32.600
The owner of several companies.
Number 96 on the list...

08:32.960 --> 08:34.840
- When was he born ?
- 1971.

08:35.720 --> 08:38.840
- One year younger than Daniel.
- His university colleague ?

08:38.919 --> 08:40.159
Where did he study ?

08:41.679 --> 08:43.759
The Kraków Academy
of Economics.

08:44.440 --> 08:47.240
Daniel studied
at the Warsaw School of Economics.

08:50.480 --> 08:51.879
Check "Konary".

08:55.399 --> 08:57.559
It's a business centre near Kraków.

08:57.639 --> 09:00.159
But what did they do there
twenty-five years ago ?

09:02.799 --> 09:04.000
There's nothing here.

09:04.080 --> 09:07.360
The earliest documents
on their server come from 1994.

09:08.360 --> 09:10.799
Before, they must have collected
analogue data.

09:13.480 --> 09:15.240
We have to go there
as soon as possible.

09:15.960 --> 09:18.159
Let's stick to Merta.
He's our connection.

09:23.200 --> 09:25.279
- I'll go there.
- No, honey.

09:25.639 --> 09:26.759
I'll manage.

10:36.559 --> 10:43.440
Kuba's here, he's going to Kraków.
Yep, all right, I'll let you know, bye.

10:44.759 --> 10:45.679
Thanks.

11:10.279 --> 11:12.039
And this is exactly what I expect.

11:13.639 --> 11:15.639
It's been all over the news
since the morning.

11:15.720 --> 11:17.440
Our citation index will surely leap.

11:17.960 --> 11:19.879
We've broken all records
for clickability.

11:19.960 --> 11:25.440
See, it's possible. Fantastic, Monika.
We need more stories like this one.

11:28.039 --> 11:29.200
What about Andrzej ?

11:30.240 --> 11:33.360
Andrzej made up his mind yesterday.
And I respect that.

11:33.960 --> 11:37.960
Today, Jurek's taking over
his duties. Any questions ?

11:41.919 --> 11:42.879
Thank you.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
What about Andrzej ?
Perhaps we might try... ?

11:54.080 --> 11:55.080
No, Monika.

11:55.600 --> 11:58.279
Unless he apologizes to me,
there's no way he's back.

12:13.200 --> 12:14.720
- Hi.
- Hi.

12:20.039 --> 12:20.960
What's up ?

12:23.840 --> 12:24.919
I feel stupid.

12:25.879 --> 12:29.480
You believed in the Editor-in-Chief,
who doesn't give a shit about us.

12:29.840 --> 12:32.360
It's not like this.
He has some arguments.

12:32.960 --> 12:34.080
Everyone does.

12:36.600 --> 12:39.120
Andrzej, this situation is pointless.
Go talk to him.

12:39.200 --> 12:40.120
No.

12:42.080 --> 12:44.000
But you'd better be careful
about what you're doing

12:44.080 --> 12:46.039
because in this job you lose
your face only once.

12:46.360 --> 12:47.519
Bye.

13:07.080 --> 13:09.480
Good morning.
The Prime Minister is waiting for you.

13:22.759 --> 13:23.840
You're here.

13:25.879 --> 13:27.039
Take a seat, please.

13:30.720 --> 13:32.080
I'll finish in a second.

13:50.240 --> 13:52.519
This thing with Kurier,
what's it about ?

13:53.519 --> 13:55.360
Nothing, it's nonsense.

13:58.080 --> 14:02.279
- And the audio ?
- They edited some parts out.

14:02.879 --> 14:06.039
They wanted something from me
but I told them to get lost.

14:10.639 --> 14:15.960
- It's not what I read there.
- Like I said. They edited the audio.

14:17.559 --> 14:19.279
- Who did ?
- I don't know.

14:20.440 --> 14:22.440
I guess it concerns the energy pact.

14:23.080 --> 14:26.120
The question is who wants to break off
the negotiations so badly.

14:26.200 --> 14:27.879
The chairman of the Polish
People's Party called me.

14:29.559 --> 14:30.799
What do they want ?

14:35.399 --> 14:37.120
Your job. Now.

14:39.519 --> 14:42.759
They'll stay in the coalition
on condition that you resign.

14:42.840 --> 14:45.200
No, you must be joking.
Because of such nonsense ?

14:45.279 --> 14:47.799
- Doesn't matter why.
- So ?

14:48.279 --> 14:51.840
You know we can't afford to let
the coalition collapse right now.

14:52.159 --> 14:54.600
Tell me, you want me to quit,
don't you ?

14:59.360 --> 15:02.679
Let's say, for personal reasons,
your resignation would be accepted.

15:05.559 --> 15:09.320
Personal reasons.
Fine, what about the negotiations ?

15:10.039 --> 15:13.879
Someone will substitute for you,
it's already the final phase.

15:21.919 --> 15:23.440
Give me one day, please.

15:24.399 --> 15:27.679
I'll finish things at the office,
say goodbye to my staff.

15:28.039 --> 15:32.879
- Then, I'll call a press conference.
- OK. Listen.

15:35.559 --> 15:40.559
You know how important
this coalition is. Especially now.

15:42.679 --> 15:43.759
Of course.

16:09.200 --> 16:10.279
Ticket, please.

16:16.799 --> 16:19.200
- Can I have your ticket, please ?
- I don't have one.

16:20.399 --> 16:21.679
So what shall we do ?

16:24.919 --> 16:27.919
Excuse me, I'm with him.
I'll pay for the ticket.

16:48.080 --> 16:49.639
He's really worried about you.

16:58.360 --> 17:02.600
- What are your plans now ?
- My plans are my business.

17:10.759 --> 17:12.720
We found something out
about your father.

17:15.400 --> 17:17.880
Near Kraków, in Konary,
there's a training centre.

17:19.039 --> 17:21.000
He might have met Bogusz there

17:21.079 --> 17:22.920
and it's possible
everything started there.

17:29.880 --> 17:33.599
I thought you could go there with me
and we'd check it together

17:33.680 --> 17:35.960
but since you already have plans...

17:38.440 --> 17:39.400
Wait.

17:44.960 --> 17:48.079
I'm going to Kraków
to visit the Dominican Church.

17:50.440 --> 17:53.119
There's the original painting
that my father used as a model.

18:23.680 --> 18:24.599
Daddy !

18:26.559 --> 18:30.440
- I've made an Easter egg, look !
- It's beautiful.

18:47.160 --> 18:49.960
- Shall I get the door ?
- No, I'll take care of this.

19:08.559 --> 19:11.599
- What do you want ?
- Why did Daniel kill himself ?

19:13.720 --> 19:15.319
I don't know
what you're talking about.

19:15.400 --> 19:18.480
- Don't fucking piss me off.
- Dad, come on.

19:19.920 --> 19:22.720
Go back to the kids.
Dad will be back in a second. Go back.

19:28.799 --> 19:29.759
Come on.

19:37.880 --> 19:42.160
- What do you want ?
- Why did my brother have to die ?

19:45.559 --> 19:46.839
- I don't know.
- You're lying.

19:48.920 --> 19:49.920
No.

19:58.559 --> 20:04.160
- I got the video from you.
- I can't. Not here.

20:06.759 --> 20:10.680
- I'll report it to the police.
- I'll tell everything but not here.

20:14.960 --> 20:17.000
My kids' life is at stake.

20:24.720 --> 20:25.720
Where then ?

20:27.799 --> 20:30.960
In a place with a lot of people around.
It's not safe here.

20:42.160 --> 20:45.000
At nine at Rotunda.
You don't show up, I call the police.

21:30.359 --> 21:31.279
Yes ?

21:33.880 --> 21:35.599
No, not now. Maybe tomorrow.

21:38.160 --> 21:39.839
What ? What do you mean fired ?

22:05.880 --> 22:06.799
Yes.

22:09.240 --> 22:10.160
Who ?

22:12.680 --> 22:13.640
Let him in.

22:13.960 --> 22:16.720
I usually make my appointments
through the secretariat.

22:16.799 --> 22:20.039
Today, I had to arrange it differently
considering the circumstances.

22:21.240 --> 22:23.240
- Circumstances ?
- Your dismissal.

22:25.839 --> 22:27.440
So everyone already knows ?

22:31.200 --> 22:32.319
That's the point.

22:33.559 --> 22:34.759
I don't understand.

22:37.200 --> 22:40.839
- My clients want to be the first.
- Could you be clearer, please ?

22:42.839 --> 22:45.519
I have a very attractive
job offer for you.

22:49.920 --> 22:52.400
- Beg your pardon ?
- In the private sector.

22:52.920 --> 22:55.000
Certainly, in the same field
of expertise.

23:01.200 --> 23:02.960
A specialist as highly-regarded

23:03.039 --> 23:06.480
as you are will receive many offers
in the next few days.

23:10.839 --> 23:13.160
But we wanted to be the first.
And it will be hard to outbid us.

23:21.279 --> 23:24.759
- I need time to think it over.
- Certainly.

23:26.559 --> 23:28.799
One day. Is that all ?

23:38.519 --> 23:39.720
Here's my number.

23:48.279 --> 23:49.359
Goodbye.

24:26.039 --> 24:27.079
Thank you.

24:39.039 --> 24:40.640
- Hello.
- Hello.

24:40.720 --> 24:43.599
We're here
about the IT infrastructure failure.

24:43.680 --> 24:48.599
That's so good ! I only opened
an e-mail with Easter greetings

24:48.680 --> 24:51.400
and all the computers
were down at once.

24:52.960 --> 24:54.640
It's a particularly mean virus.

24:55.799 --> 24:58.519
We'll have to delete it
from every unit separately.

24:59.079 --> 25:00.200
Oh my.

25:01.480 --> 25:03.759
How many workstations
are in your company ?

25:03.839 --> 25:06.319
This one,
two at each of the offices,

25:06.400 --> 25:09.559
plus one in the reading room
and one in the archive.

25:10.720 --> 25:12.599
Why don't we start
with the archive ?

25:25.039 --> 25:26.559
Wait, I've got something.

25:26.640 --> 25:29.960
A seminary for students.
"Leaders of the New Millennium 1992."

25:38.240 --> 25:40.640
- What about a list of participants ?
- It's not here.

25:45.240 --> 25:46.480
Hold on, hold on.

25:51.480 --> 25:54.359
- What are you doing ?
- I've got the name of the coordinator.

26:00.559 --> 26:03.279
Strojnowski.

26:08.799 --> 26:10.279
Lech Strojnowski.

26:17.119 --> 26:19.920
- Tomorrow as usual, a quarter past ?
- Don't drive in.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.119
Let's meet.

26:44.319 --> 26:47.319
- What a prick.
- Andrzej didn't give him any choice.

26:47.400 --> 26:48.440
Stop it.

26:48.519 --> 26:51.079
It might be called off.
You just need to talk to Andrzej.

26:51.160 --> 26:53.039
He's an independent,
experienced journalist

26:53.119 --> 26:55.319
and not some fucking media worker.

26:55.400 --> 26:57.319
You're the only person
that can persuade him.

27:01.519 --> 27:07.319
- And ? Is this all you've got ?
- For now...

27:11.160 --> 27:13.759
Andrzej's right.
You're puppets in someone's hands.

27:13.839 --> 27:15.240
It's a setup, all right.

27:18.160 --> 27:19.839
- Thanks for your help.
- Wait.

27:20.680 --> 27:22.359
I'll talk to him, that's obvious.

27:23.759 --> 27:27.799
Tell me: what business did Bogusz
do with Merta ?

27:30.200 --> 27:35.799
- None. They were friends.
- Friends.

27:36.920 --> 27:42.720
They went skiing in St Moritz
and diving in the Maldives.

27:47.279 --> 27:49.119
Let me know how it went,
will you ?

27:50.359 --> 27:51.480
Yep.

27:54.839 --> 27:55.920
Bye.

28:08.359 --> 28:11.279
Hi, Andrzej, I've heard you
have an evening off.

28:13.680 --> 28:14.680
Call me back.

28:31.240 --> 28:32.160
Let's go, Kuba.

28:44.119 --> 28:45.920
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

28:46.680 --> 28:48.119
How can I help you ?

28:48.200 --> 28:51.359
Hello, we're here
to see Professor Strojnowski.

28:51.440 --> 28:53.160
But Professor's not here.

28:53.240 --> 28:55.480
He's in Kraków,
at the Dominican Church.

29:03.400 --> 29:05.240
I thought
we were not supposed to meet.

29:10.359 --> 29:12.559
I shouldn't have left
you alone with this.

29:12.640 --> 29:15.279
I'll manage.
You owe me nothing.

29:18.480 --> 29:19.400
I'm sorry.

29:28.400 --> 29:29.759
I want to be with you.

29:39.839 --> 29:40.759
When ?

29:44.200 --> 29:47.599
- When the scandal is all over ?
- No. Now.

29:56.359 --> 29:58.559
And you're sure
this is the best moment ?

30:00.440 --> 30:02.240
When will the moment be right ?

30:12.920 --> 30:13.920
Bye.

30:44.240 --> 30:46.039
Professor ! Good afternoon.

30:47.599 --> 30:51.359
My name's Kuba Grodecki.
I'm Daniel Grodecki's son.

30:52.599 --> 30:54.559
Can I ask you a few questions ?

30:56.680 --> 30:58.240
Our aim was very simple.

30:59.480 --> 31:01.960
We wanted to gather
the best economy students

31:02.039 --> 31:03.880
from around Poland in one place.

31:05.559 --> 31:08.039
Later on, they were supposed
to change our country later.

31:09.319 --> 31:11.079
An exceptional generation.

31:14.240 --> 31:16.839
They took their finals
in a Communist state

31:18.359 --> 31:20.920
but started university
in free Poland.

31:22.559 --> 31:25.119
Our enthusiasm was enormous,
enormous !

31:25.960 --> 31:31.799
We truly believed that those people
would build the new market here.

31:32.640 --> 31:35.000
Konary was going
to be only the beginning.

31:37.839 --> 31:41.200
- This is where we met afterwards.
- Afterwards ?

31:42.519 --> 31:47.240
Yes. After the course finished,
some students, including your father,

31:47.319 --> 31:49.720
asked me to continue our seminary.

31:51.079 --> 31:54.279
And what did you teach them ?
How to achieve success ?

31:54.640 --> 31:57.279
Of course.
Most importantly,

31:57.359 --> 32:00.759
they were to leave this place equipped
with certain principles.

32:02.200 --> 32:03.519
What principles ?

32:04.559 --> 32:10.599
It may sound funny...
Justice, honesty...

32:21.240 --> 32:24.440
- It was my best group.
- Is this Grzegorz Merta ?

32:31.400 --> 32:33.960
I never believed
your father was a swindler.

32:36.400 --> 32:39.720
Daniel was too smart
to get involved in such a silly thing.

32:44.559 --> 32:46.839
And this one,
with his head turned, who is he ?

32:48.240 --> 32:50.480
This is our child prodigy.

32:51.680 --> 32:53.759
I'm sure you know him:
Tomasz Nawrot.

32:55.799 --> 32:58.319
Would you like to comment
on today's articlein Kurier ?

32:58.960 --> 33:01.440
Kurier, I haven't read it yet.

33:02.160 --> 33:04.720
Do you admit to having contacts
with Minister Skalski ?

33:04.799 --> 33:07.240
Oh, yes, certainly.
He's a very nice man.

33:07.319 --> 33:09.680
So you're confirming you approached
Minister Skalski with a bribe ?

33:09.759 --> 33:11.119
No, I didn't say that.

33:11.200 --> 33:13.559
What did your cooperation with
the Minister specifically involve ?

33:13.640 --> 33:15.000
Ladies and gentlemen

33:15.079 --> 33:17.680
I'll keep you in suspense
for a little longer.

33:17.759 --> 33:20.880
- Can't you tell us anything more ?
- Everything will clear up soon.

33:20.960 --> 33:24.000
Thank you very much for now.
Excuse me. Goodbye. Thank you.

35:58.079 --> 35:59.239
Going anywhere ?

36:02.320 --> 36:04.119
I already told you.
Not here and not now.

36:04.199 --> 36:06.239
Don't bullshit me.
How did you know about Bogusz ?

36:09.000 --> 36:10.719
Tell me or I'm calling the police.

36:14.559 --> 36:19.400
No. We were in this together,
Adrian too.

36:20.159 --> 36:21.880
We meaning who ? You ? Daniel ?

36:26.519 --> 36:29.760
Fuck, tell me !
All right, I'm gonna make this call.

36:32.239 --> 36:34.400
- It's much bigger than you think.
- What is ?

36:38.440 --> 36:40.079
- Big money.
- How big is big ?

36:40.719 --> 36:44.280
Huge. The kind of money
you can kill for.

36:44.360 --> 36:48.280
- Even children ?
- It was a tragedy... An accident.

36:49.679 --> 36:53.760
- No one had suspected it was for real.
- What was ?

36:57.079 --> 36:58.800
- The Pact.
- What fucking Pact ?

36:59.679 --> 37:03.000
Go now, will you ?
Leave me alone. Go now, go.

37:03.079 --> 37:05.400
- Who killed that child ?
- You know what it's about ?

37:05.800 --> 37:07.760
Nobody's willing to sacrifice
their own kids

37:07.840 --> 37:10.960
but this is the best
guarantee of loyalty...

37:11.039 --> 37:13.760
Whose idea was that ?
Who else is behind it ?

37:13.840 --> 37:16.719
Please, go.
I'm sorry I gave it to you.

37:17.079 --> 37:20.519
Just say it. You hear me ?
Tell me ! Fuck, tell me !

37:26.760 --> 37:28.960
- Here's my train.
- What ?

38:31.800 --> 38:33.159
Good afternoon, everyone.

38:34.079 --> 38:36.239
Minister Skalski will make
a short statement.

38:37.480 --> 38:41.159
He will not, however,
answer any questions at the moment.

38:42.079 --> 38:43.239
Thank you.

39:01.440 --> 39:03.199
Good afternoon, everyone.

39:05.880 --> 39:08.119
For the last few days,
I've experienced attacks

39:08.199 --> 39:12.920
targeted at my personal life
and professional career.

39:14.280 --> 39:16.880
I'm not going to explain
personal matters to you.

39:18.920 --> 39:22.480
Yet, as for my professional activities,
I want to make it clear

39:23.800 --> 39:26.360
that I have never,
never accepted

39:27.920 --> 39:33.079
financial benefits from
Mr Bogusz or Mr Nawrot.

39:35.039 --> 39:36.320
Never.

39:41.079 --> 39:44.079
Despite that,
I've been asked to resign.

39:47.239 --> 39:51.079
In a democratic society,
it is common practice

39:52.360 --> 39:55.800
to step back from politics
until things are clarified.

39:58.320 --> 39:59.719
It is good practice.

40:04.199 --> 40:05.960
But I'm not going to do this.

40:08.960 --> 40:10.480
I'm not going to resign.

40:12.880 --> 40:16.519
Kurier published the transcript
of a fabricated recording.

40:16.599 --> 40:17.800
I'm innocent.

40:18.840 --> 40:22.840
I won't let rumour
and manipulation control our politics.

40:25.039 --> 40:26.320
I won't let it happen.

40:28.719 --> 40:30.039
Any questions ?

40:30.119 --> 40:32.280
How did the PM react
to your decision ?

40:32.360 --> 40:34.119
You're the first to hear it.

40:34.639 --> 40:37.559
Who might want to release
the fabricated audio ?

40:38.280 --> 40:40.920
I think you should answer
this question, not me.

40:41.400 --> 40:44.039
I understand that before
you published the transcript,

40:44.119 --> 40:46.800
you must have figured out
what aim someone tried to achieveby

40:46.880 --> 40:48.559
using you as a tool,
is that correct ?

40:48.639 --> 40:50.159
Thank you very much.

41:45.239 --> 41:46.320
You got anything ?

41:52.320 --> 41:53.239
Kuba...

41:53.760 --> 41:57.599
Fine, actually,
I'm not really sure what I counted on.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.119
I wish I'd been a regular here
like you.

42:17.159 --> 42:18.400
Something happened ?

42:20.960 --> 42:21.880
What is it ?

42:28.920 --> 42:30.480
There's been another suicide.

42:35.239 --> 42:37.400
- Who ?
- Grzegorz Merta.

42:37.480 --> 42:39.519
Fuck... I saw him jump
in front of the train.

42:42.000 --> 42:47.400
It's no coincidence, Andrzej.
Daniel, Bogusz, Merta.

42:49.360 --> 42:51.000
They all got into some sick deal,

42:51.360 --> 42:54.199
in which the guarantee was
the life of their children.

42:54.280 --> 42:57.800
- Hold on. Just listen to yourself.
- Even Nawrot is in this.

42:59.280 --> 43:02.440
We found their location.
It's been going on for years.

43:08.039 --> 43:09.280
- Drop it.
- What ?

43:10.320 --> 43:11.920
Drop it before it's too late.

43:13.679 --> 43:15.639
If what you're saying is true

43:17.039 --> 43:20.639
and someone's powerful enough
to force those guys to do such things,

43:21.719 --> 43:23.840
maybe this time it isn't worth it ?

43:29.960 --> 43:31.360
What is this all about ?

44:16.719 --> 44:17.880
Yes ?

44:17.960 --> 44:21.599
One of the participants
of Konary trainings,

44:22.000 --> 44:24.400
an acquaintance of Daniel's,
went missing two years ago,

44:24.480 --> 44:26.079
together with his son.

44:26.159 --> 44:28.519
I found his photo.
It's that boy..

44:28.599 --> 44:30.159
The boy from the video ?

44:30.239 --> 44:33.880
They both went missing
on July 20th, 2013.

44:34.800 --> 44:35.800
Wait.

44:42.159 --> 44:45.119
July 20th is the date
in the painting with Kuba.

44:48.719 --> 44:49.800
Wait, wait. Hold on.

44:54.079 --> 44:55.119
Hold on.

44:58.639 --> 44:59.599
Kuba !

45:01.280 --> 45:03.119
Hello, can you hear me,
Weronika ?

45:16.679 --> 45:17.840
Hello.

45:39.280 --> 45:40.679
What is it again ?

45:40.760 --> 45:42.239
You're under arrest in connection

45:42.320 --> 45:44.800
with deaths of Grzegorz Merta
and Adrian Bogusz.

45:44.880 --> 45:46.719
You have the right to an attorney.

46:09.760 --> 46:11.760
PAKT
Episode 4
