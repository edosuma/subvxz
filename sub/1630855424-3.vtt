WEBVTT

00:16.360 --> 00:17.652
Fucking pond.

00:17.652 --> 00:19.696
I know. Isn't it great?

00:21.281 --> 00:23.742
I'm beginning to think
this one's a little touched.

00:23.742 --> 00:24.994
You just noticed?

00:24.994 --> 00:27.621
Guys, quit fucking around.
This is serious.

00:27.621 --> 00:29.123
Don't worry.
The chop looks good.

00:29.123 --> 00:31.291
Just stand there, look pretty.

00:31.291 --> 00:32.584
I'll do the talking.

00:32.584 --> 00:34.419
It looked good
in our basement.

00:34.419 --> 00:36.796
But ripping off Happy Jack
is a different fucking story.

00:37.839 --> 00:40.044
If this deal goes sideways,
I'm fucking blaming you.

00:41.510 --> 00:43.553
If this goes sideways,
it won't matter.

00:51.728 --> 00:54.814
I hope you Chinamen didn't
come to us for credit.

00:55.732 --> 00:58.152
Because you put me
in a very difficult position

00:58.152 --> 01:01.738
the last time you asked me
to hold onto your shit.

01:01.738 --> 01:03.698
We had a minor
cash flow issue.

01:03.698 --> 01:05.069
And we very much appreciate

01:05.159 --> 01:06.826
you holding on
to our product for us--

01:06.826 --> 01:09.246
He ain't interested
in your appreciation.

01:09.246 --> 01:11.248
You got our money?

01:12.624 --> 01:13.667
Give him the chop.

01:17.296 --> 01:21.133
This covers our last order
and our next one,

01:21.133 --> 01:22.842
plus a little extra
for your trouble.

01:34.813 --> 01:36.773
What are you
doing here, Chao?

01:38.483 --> 01:39.818
Hmm?

01:41.403 --> 01:43.155
You're running
with the Hop Wei now?

01:47.367 --> 01:49.494
I make investment.

01:50.454 --> 01:52.164
Investments?

01:54.791 --> 01:57.502
Things must be worse
than I thought.

01:59.338 --> 02:01.423
Like I said,
a minor cash flow issue.

02:01.423 --> 02:02.591
The cops are squeezing us.

02:05.052 --> 02:07.429
We have it all worked out now.

02:13.560 --> 02:15.062
They're straight.

02:18.065 --> 02:19.608
I guess you do.

02:22.277 --> 02:23.778
Give these men their product.

04:05.839 --> 04:07.757
Douglas.

04:07.757 --> 04:09.676
You're back.

04:09.676 --> 04:12.304
The work is never done,
it seems.

04:12.304 --> 04:14.139
Was there a problem
with your wine?

04:14.139 --> 04:15.975
I wasn't expecting
to see you again so soon.

04:15.975 --> 04:17.226
No, not at all.

04:17.226 --> 04:19.311
It might be
your best vintage yet.

04:19.311 --> 04:23.315
I just came by to see
if you'd reconsidered my offer.

04:24.268 --> 04:25.985
I thought I made
my position clear.

04:26.902 --> 04:29.071
You did, you did, but...

04:29.071 --> 04:30.906
I wouldn't be where I am today
without believing

04:30.906 --> 04:33.533
there's always a deal
to be made.

04:35.452 --> 04:36.786
I couldn't help noticing
you have a lot

04:36.786 --> 04:38.872
of Chinese girls working here.

04:39.831 --> 04:41.375
What of it?

04:41.375 --> 04:43.793
Well, it's just
that some folks--

04:43.793 --> 04:47.256
not me, mind you--
but some folks around here

04:47.256 --> 04:51.343
might surmise that this place
was some kind of brothel.

04:54.221 --> 04:55.889
But not you.

04:55.889 --> 04:57.141
Of course,
you're quite familiar

04:57.141 --> 04:58.767
with the genuine article.

04:59.935 --> 05:01.270
I blame the politicians.

05:01.270 --> 05:02.771
They've got everyone
all riled up

05:02.771 --> 05:05.149
with this Page Act business.

05:05.149 --> 05:07.276
Well, you know me.

05:07.276 --> 05:09.111
I never much cared
what other people think,

05:09.111 --> 05:11.196
least of all politicians.

05:11.196 --> 05:13.490
On that, we can agree.

05:13.490 --> 05:15.159
But nevertheless,
if the government

05:15.159 --> 05:18.037
caught wind
of what's happening here--

05:18.037 --> 05:20.324
Oh, I have a dozen
San Francisco police

05:20.414 --> 05:22.457
who will testify on my behalf.

05:22.457 --> 05:23.833
They helped me
liberate these girls.

05:23.833 --> 05:25.085
Of course.

05:25.085 --> 05:26.670
I read all about it
in the "Register."

05:26.670 --> 05:31.008
Nellie Davenport,
savior of Chinatown's whores.

05:32.551 --> 05:36.596
I just wonder
what they'd make of you now,

05:36.596 --> 05:38.265
sharing your bed with one.

05:43.895 --> 05:46.273
It's a reasonable offer.

05:50.194 --> 05:52.404
Get the hell off my land.

06:12.757 --> 06:15.510
So this cop knows
you're wanted for murder.

06:15.510 --> 06:19.306
And instead of arresting you,
he wants to deputize you.

06:19.306 --> 06:21.641
That's the gist of it.

06:21.641 --> 06:24.937
Must be nice to be white.

06:24.937 --> 06:26.939
You're not considering it,
are you?

06:29.691 --> 06:31.193
You're considering it.

06:33.028 --> 06:34.947
If I help him,
we can finally stop

06:34.947 --> 06:36.740
looking over our shoulders.

06:36.740 --> 06:38.783
Have you looked
in a mirror lately?

06:38.783 --> 06:40.995
As long as we're together, honey,

06:40.995 --> 06:42.913
we're always gonna be
looking over our shoulders.

06:42.913 --> 06:45.249
You said that you wanted
to stay in San Francisco.

06:45.249 --> 06:47.084
This is how we do it.
No more bounty hunters.

06:47.084 --> 06:49.753
And a cop living in my bar?

06:49.753 --> 06:51.796
How do you think
that's gonna play?

06:55.050 --> 06:58.470
That badge isn't just bad
for business.

06:58.470 --> 06:59.804
It's bad for you.

07:04.428 --> 07:08.230
The last thing I want to do
is go back to Chinatown.

07:08.230 --> 07:11.400
But if there's
even half a chance

07:11.400 --> 07:14.111
I can buy us a future,
I have to try.

07:22.202 --> 07:25.705
The attack on Li Yong was
a desperate act of cowardice

07:25.705 --> 07:26.957
by Muchen.

07:26.957 --> 07:31.455
But thanks to Kong Pak,
his plot failed.

07:31.545 --> 07:33.672
The surviving members
of the Three Brothers tong

07:33.672 --> 07:35.215
will be sworn in soon.

07:35.215 --> 07:37.717
These men betrayed us.

07:37.717 --> 07:40.012
How can we ensure
their loyalty?

07:42.556 --> 07:45.684
Kong Pak, you know these men.

07:45.684 --> 07:47.019
What do you think?

07:48.895 --> 07:50.981
Muchen ruled by fear.

07:50.981 --> 07:55.194
Now that he's gone,
his hatchets will fall in line.

07:57.279 --> 07:59.949
Then we'll proceed
as planned.

07:59.949 --> 08:01.951
But I'd like you
to keep an eye on them.

08:11.751 --> 08:14.879
Not the sort of dress
you usually wear.

08:14.879 --> 08:17.925
It was a gift from Eliza.

08:17.925 --> 08:21.053
She invited me
to an art gallery.

08:25.182 --> 08:28.560
You're starting to spend
a lot of time in the pond.

08:28.560 --> 08:31.230
Just enough time
to look after our interests.

08:31.230 --> 08:33.565
It's a risk.

08:35.067 --> 08:36.944
But a calculated one.

08:39.779 --> 08:41.573
I should come with you.

08:41.573 --> 08:43.783
You're not safe
out there alone.

08:43.783 --> 08:46.828
It's not a meeting
with a rival tong.

08:46.828 --> 08:48.914
I'll be fine.

08:48.914 --> 08:51.666
Besides, your presence
will only make it harder

08:51.666 --> 08:53.585
to gain their trust.

08:59.925 --> 09:02.177
Agent Moseley.

09:02.177 --> 09:05.014
I take it you know Mr. Lee?

09:05.014 --> 09:08.725
Only by reputation,
which does you no favors.

09:08.725 --> 09:10.477
Coming from this outfit,
I take that

09:10.477 --> 09:12.312
as a compliment, sir.

09:14.648 --> 09:16.108
If you're done
fawning over each other,

09:16.108 --> 09:17.484
maybe you could do us a favor
and round up

09:17.484 --> 09:19.694
the Chinatown squad...

09:19.694 --> 09:22.322
Chief?

09:22.322 --> 09:26.701
Yes, sir.

09:26.701 --> 09:29.573
Agent Moseley has tracked
the counterfeiting operation

09:29.663 --> 09:31.331
to San Francisco.

09:33.500 --> 09:36.128
We have reason to believe
the men running it

09:36.128 --> 09:38.130
are headquartered in Chinatown.

09:38.130 --> 09:39.423
Which is why
we'd like your squad

09:39.423 --> 09:44.011
to test the local currency
as you make your rounds.

09:44.011 --> 09:48.182
A single drop is all it takes
to ferret out a fake.

09:52.727 --> 09:55.898
If the bill is legal tender,
the iodine won't leave a mark.

09:57.232 --> 09:59.603
We're trying
to keep the chinks

09:59.693 --> 10:00.986
from slaughtering one another.

10:02.404 --> 10:04.573
There's no time
for fucking chemistry.

10:07.534 --> 10:09.744
Those payoffs you're taking
could be counterfeit too.

10:09.744 --> 10:12.872
So you'd be doing yourself
a favor.

10:15.167 --> 10:17.044
Would you mind
repeating that?

10:17.044 --> 10:19.129
Which word
didn't you understand?

10:19.129 --> 10:22.049
You shit-sucking
son of a bitch.

10:22.049 --> 10:23.800
- Come on.
- Thank you, gentlemen.

10:23.800 --> 10:26.929
We'll keep your concerns
in mind.

10:29.598 --> 10:32.601
Now, if there's nothing more,

10:32.601 --> 10:34.269
my men have work to do.

10:35.812 --> 10:38.232
You told me you were done
with police work.

10:38.232 --> 10:39.316
I was.

10:40.442 --> 10:43.237
I will be again,
as soon as this is over.

10:48.033 --> 10:52.079
So... what's the plan?

10:52.079 --> 10:54.539
Besides insulting my men.

10:54.539 --> 10:57.126
Moseley says
the original crew was buying

10:57.126 --> 10:58.961
weapons from a Chinaman.

10:58.961 --> 11:02.631
I figured I'd start by paying
a visit to Mr. Wang Chao.

11:05.217 --> 11:08.178
Well, Chao is not
much of a fan of yours.

11:08.178 --> 11:10.639
Oh, maybe I should come along

11:10.639 --> 11:13.808
and help smooth things over.

11:13.808 --> 11:17.854
I appreciate that, but...

11:17.854 --> 11:20.941
that might muddy the waters.

11:24.819 --> 11:27.614
I need to do this my way, Bill.

11:32.827 --> 11:35.039
Well...

11:35.039 --> 11:36.373
well, in that case...

11:38.292 --> 11:40.877
Stay safe, Agent Lee.

11:40.877 --> 11:42.254
Afraid I can't promise that.

11:42.254 --> 11:45.299
Well, then just for fuck's sake,
stay alive, huh?

12:00.439 --> 12:02.274
That's--that's all of it.

12:05.277 --> 12:06.946
"Thank you."
You're welcome.

12:06.946 --> 12:08.655
For what?

12:08.655 --> 12:10.574
Forcing me to work for you?

12:13.660 --> 12:16.121
Hey, do I need to remind you

12:16.121 --> 12:19.166
that you came to us?

12:19.166 --> 12:21.210
Yeah, to get you
up and running,

12:21.210 --> 12:23.295
not to join your gang.

12:25.130 --> 12:27.882
Look,

12:27.882 --> 12:30.552
I get it,
but you don't need to worry.

12:30.552 --> 12:31.678
We protect our own.

12:33.138 --> 12:35.640
You know, one of you said

12:35.640 --> 12:39.186
the exact same thing
to my father.

12:39.186 --> 12:43.857
We missed one payment,
and you beat him.

12:43.857 --> 12:44.942
That wasn't me.

12:44.942 --> 12:46.986
You wear the same suit.

12:51.448 --> 12:53.909
That--

12:53.909 --> 12:57.246
yeah, that never
should have happened.

12:57.246 --> 13:01.125
I know it might not mean much,
but I'm sorry.

13:11.795 --> 13:13.797
Come find me when you're done.

13:31.947 --> 13:35.075
Can you imagine
living in a log cabin

13:35.075 --> 13:37.744
with nothing but dirt
for a floor?

13:37.744 --> 13:42.249
Nothing to relieve yourself
into but a wooden bucket?

13:43.250 --> 13:45.294
Actually, I can.

13:47.212 --> 13:50.757
Sorry.
God, I must sound so entitled.

13:50.757 --> 13:52.259
Not at all.

13:52.259 --> 13:54.303
Just American.

13:56.513 --> 13:57.932
Is the artist here?

13:57.932 --> 13:59.766
Who knows?

13:59.766 --> 14:01.726
Nobody comes here for the art.

14:01.726 --> 14:05.064
They come here
to see and be seen.

14:05.064 --> 14:06.731
And to drink.

14:08.025 --> 14:09.651
Thank you.

14:14.031 --> 14:17.284
Gosh, it feels like
I'm the one hanging on the wall.

14:17.284 --> 14:18.827
Don't mind them.

14:18.827 --> 14:20.245
They're just jealous.

14:20.245 --> 14:23.665
You wear that dress
better than they ever could.

14:23.665 --> 14:26.418
Well, dear,

14:26.418 --> 14:30.297
if you wanted to cause a stir,
you've certainly done it.

14:30.297 --> 14:32.049
Not my intention.

14:32.049 --> 14:33.968
But a nice fringe benefit.

14:35.344 --> 14:37.596
Mai Ling,
this is my husband, Bernard.

14:37.596 --> 14:40.015
It's a pleasure to meet you.

14:40.015 --> 14:41.808
Pleasure is mine.

14:41.808 --> 14:44.519
Eliza hasn't stopped
talking about you all week.

14:44.519 --> 14:46.605
She says you're quite
the business woman.

14:46.605 --> 14:48.732
I've made
some good investments.

14:48.732 --> 14:51.360
But hardly the sort
that would impress

14:51.360 --> 14:53.195
a banker of your stature.

14:53.195 --> 14:55.155
Your firm finances
some of the largest

14:55.155 --> 14:57.116
construction projects
in the city.

14:57.116 --> 14:59.659
You've done your research.

14:59.659 --> 15:02.246
May I say
your English is flawless?

15:04.081 --> 15:06.208
Well, yours isn't
too bad either.

15:11.255 --> 15:13.007
You did not tell me
she was funny.

15:13.007 --> 15:15.092
She's funny.

15:15.092 --> 15:16.760
Cheers.

15:24.929 --> 15:27.479
It looks like Eliza Pendleton
has a new project.

15:28.772 --> 15:30.857
Gentlemen.

15:32.484 --> 15:33.693
You know her?

15:33.693 --> 15:35.737
The Chinese girl? No.

15:35.737 --> 15:37.822
But Eliza's always been
determined to seem

15:37.822 --> 15:40.742
just this side
of the avant-garde.

15:40.742 --> 15:43.453
Miss Archer, wasn't it?

15:43.453 --> 15:45.289
I'm flattered you remembered.

15:45.289 --> 15:47.707
Since I imagine
you misplaced my card,

15:47.707 --> 15:51.461
or is there some other reason
you haven't called on me?

15:53.172 --> 15:56.675
I thought
you were simply being polite.

15:58.218 --> 15:59.929
When you get to know me,
you'll realize

15:59.929 --> 16:01.846
I'm rarely, if ever, polite.

16:04.808 --> 16:08.353
I can't wait to watch you knock
that smug bastard on his ass.

16:10.189 --> 16:11.976
That makes two of us.

16:12.066 --> 16:13.817
I mean, the whole
"man of the people" routine

16:13.817 --> 16:16.320
is getting stale,
don't you think?

16:19.281 --> 16:21.450
Well, I think I've had
about all the culture

16:21.450 --> 16:23.743
I can stand for one day.

16:23.743 --> 16:26.621
I recommend you call on me
soon, Mr. Buckley,

16:26.621 --> 16:28.332
or else I might decide
you don't like me,

16:28.332 --> 16:31.335
and then I'll become intolerable.

16:40.469 --> 16:42.637
And you can prove this?

16:42.637 --> 16:44.306
Given the amount of money
in that envelope,

16:44.306 --> 16:45.474
it shouldn't matter.

16:45.474 --> 16:47.011
But yes.

16:47.101 --> 16:48.560
We've got two witnesses
who can put

16:48.560 --> 16:50.812
Thayer's brother-in-law
in a Chinese opium den

16:50.812 --> 16:52.814
as recently as last week.

16:52.814 --> 16:56.318
A real scandal,
if it were to come out.

16:58.022 --> 17:00.447
The story will play better
if I can bring them in,

17:00.447 --> 17:01.615
ask a few questions.

17:01.615 --> 17:02.908
For obvious reasons,

17:02.908 --> 17:05.327
these men wish
to remain anonymous.

17:05.327 --> 17:08.788
However, in the interest
of due diligence,

17:08.788 --> 17:10.207
everything is there.

17:10.207 --> 17:13.293
Quotes, dates, and times.

17:16.380 --> 17:18.590
I was thinking
for the headline,

17:18.590 --> 17:20.884
"Thayer Campaign, Up In Smoke."

17:24.763 --> 17:25.847
You're the professional.

17:32.854 --> 17:34.564
Evening, Mr. Strickland.

17:36.060 --> 17:38.318
I'm sorry, do I know you?

17:38.318 --> 17:40.529
Name's Dylan Leary.

17:40.529 --> 17:41.863
I need a quick word.

17:41.863 --> 17:43.865
Leary.

17:43.865 --> 17:46.368
Champion of the workingman.

17:46.368 --> 17:48.203
I hear you've been causing
quite a stir

17:48.203 --> 17:49.663
down at City Council.

17:49.663 --> 17:51.706
I'm here on behalf
of Leonard Pierce.

17:53.208 --> 17:54.459
So now the City Council
has got you

17:54.459 --> 17:56.461
breaking legs for them,
is that it?

17:57.671 --> 18:00.715
I don't doubt you're
a dangerous man, Mr. Leary.

18:00.715 --> 18:02.009
But if Pierce went
to all the trouble

18:02.009 --> 18:05.345
to pay you to threaten me,
I would at least think

18:05.345 --> 18:07.389
he told you
I never travel alone.

18:10.892 --> 18:12.394
It must have slipped
his mind.

18:13.478 --> 18:15.605
That's too bad.

18:15.605 --> 18:17.900
Either way, I hope
it's becoming clear to you,

18:17.900 --> 18:20.986
I'm not the man you threaten,
Mr. Leary.

18:21.987 --> 18:24.108
I'm the man
with whom you make a deal.

18:43.926 --> 18:45.129
Come on.

18:46.845 --> 18:48.388
Let's have a chat.

19:09.826 --> 19:12.246
So this is what gangsters do
for fun?

19:14.456 --> 19:17.084
You know, when they're not
beating up old men.

19:18.961 --> 19:22.965
Well, actually,
I have many interests.

19:22.965 --> 19:25.169
Sometimes I beat up young men.

19:25.259 --> 19:26.927
Oh, how sweet.

19:28.303 --> 19:29.596
I'm done printing.

19:29.596 --> 19:31.056
The bills will be dry
in the morning.

19:31.056 --> 19:33.392
Great. I'll walk you home.

19:33.392 --> 19:35.477
Uh, thank you.

19:35.477 --> 19:38.981
Actually, I think I'll just
take my payment and go.

19:38.981 --> 19:42.817
Well, I need
to pat you down first.

19:44.611 --> 19:46.446
Young Jun's orders.

19:46.446 --> 19:48.192
They have trust issues.

19:49.449 --> 19:50.700
Arms up.

20:04.006 --> 20:05.090
Just, um--

20:05.090 --> 20:06.383
Mm-hmm.

20:11.638 --> 20:14.099
Okay, all good.

20:14.099 --> 20:15.684
Yeah.

20:17.436 --> 20:19.146
- There you go.
- Thanks.

20:20.981 --> 20:22.691
Have a good night.

20:22.691 --> 20:26.778
You have fun
playing with your wood.

20:44.421 --> 20:46.756
You were in the cavalry?

20:46.756 --> 20:50.177
Served under Sheridan
in the Army of the Potomac.

20:50.177 --> 20:52.596
Fightin' Phil Sheridan?

20:52.596 --> 20:54.764
The man's a fucking legend.

20:54.764 --> 20:56.934
He certainly thought so.

20:56.934 --> 21:00.479
We used to call him Little Phil
behind his back.

21:00.479 --> 21:01.771
He was so short,

21:01.771 --> 21:04.108
he could scratch his own ankles
without stooping over.

21:07.069 --> 21:08.820
Did you serve?

21:08.820 --> 21:13.033
88th Infantry, Irish brigade.

21:13.033 --> 21:15.452
The Fearless Sons of Erin.

21:15.452 --> 21:17.037
You gave those Rebels hell.

21:19.081 --> 21:21.917
They sent
a few of us there too.

21:24.962 --> 21:28.882
My boy, Louis, fell at
the Battle of Sailors' Creek.

21:29.967 --> 21:33.762
I lost his mother
in childbirth, and...

21:33.762 --> 21:35.097
at the time,
I remember thinking

21:35.097 --> 21:37.807
I'd suffered the worst pain
life has to offer.

21:41.478 --> 21:43.188
Turns out I was wrong.

21:48.610 --> 21:52.281
Every day of the war,

21:52.281 --> 21:54.992
I prayed to make it home
to my boys.

21:59.579 --> 22:01.248
And I did...

22:04.418 --> 22:06.253
So the pox could take 'em.

22:10.007 --> 22:12.301
If there is a God,
he has a sick sense of humor.

22:12.301 --> 22:15.262
He's a fucking prick
is what he is.

22:17.597 --> 22:20.559
You and I know the price
this country demands.

22:22.852 --> 22:24.646
We've paid it tenfold
for the freedom

22:24.646 --> 22:26.606
to build something of our own.

22:28.858 --> 22:31.236
Men like Pierce and his cronies
will never understand that.

22:31.236 --> 22:32.612
They were born into wealth.

22:32.612 --> 22:33.989
They've sacrificed nothing.

22:33.989 --> 22:36.491
I earned every dime
I ever made.

22:36.491 --> 22:39.661
From where I'm sitting,
you don't look so different.

22:41.871 --> 22:43.958
On the surface, maybe.

22:43.958 --> 22:46.126
But I don't think
the way they do.

22:46.126 --> 22:50.797
They see you as a thug,
someone to do their dirty work.

22:50.797 --> 22:52.549
I see something else.

22:52.549 --> 22:54.134
And what's that?

22:54.134 --> 22:56.345
A political powerhouse.

22:56.345 --> 22:58.638
The voice of the Irish.

22:59.848 --> 23:02.726
But what good is that voice
if nobody listens?

23:02.726 --> 23:04.353
You twist some arms, you get

23:04.353 --> 23:06.188
five Irish hired here,
ten there.

23:06.188 --> 23:08.607
- And their families eat.
- Yes, but nothing has changed.

23:08.607 --> 23:09.691
You're thinking too small.

23:11.735 --> 23:14.529
The problem you face
is systemic.

23:14.529 --> 23:17.199
It's built into the economics
of the country.

23:17.199 --> 23:19.201
If you want to change that,

23:19.201 --> 23:20.995
you need the kind
of political capital

23:20.995 --> 23:23.205
that comes with real power.

23:24.748 --> 23:27.751
Otherwise, you'll end up
a washed-up gangster

23:27.751 --> 23:29.711
with nothing
but your noble intentions

23:29.711 --> 23:31.130
to show for your troubles.

23:34.508 --> 23:35.842
<i>These are fucked-up times.</i>

23:37.844 --> 23:40.264
The bulls are in our bowl.

23:40.264 --> 23:42.474
The Long Zii are puffing up
their chests.

23:42.474 --> 23:44.184
Fuck the Long Zii!

23:46.561 --> 23:48.105
It's been tough.

23:48.105 --> 23:49.814
I won't deny it.

23:52.401 --> 23:56.363
But we're
the motherfucking Hop Wei!

23:57.822 --> 24:00.159
And there aren't enough cops
in San Francisco

24:00.159 --> 24:01.994
to stop us
from running our business.

24:04.704 --> 24:08.417
We're back in the molasses game
stronger than ever.

24:14.506 --> 24:17.509
So get drunk.

24:17.509 --> 24:18.969
Get sticky.

24:18.969 --> 24:21.555
Yeah!

24:21.555 --> 24:25.434
Because tomorrow,
we get back to being

24:25.434 --> 24:28.603
the baddest fucking tong
in Chinatown!

24:45.787 --> 24:47.491
Your boss seems happy.

24:51.460 --> 24:52.920
Yeah.

24:52.920 --> 24:55.172
But you're not.

24:56.381 --> 24:58.675
Printing was supposed to be
a solution,

24:58.675 --> 25:00.594
not the solution.

25:00.594 --> 25:04.264
We should be using the chop
to buy more soldiers, not--

25:04.264 --> 25:05.640
not booze and whores.

25:06.558 --> 25:08.435
Then you better hurry.

25:08.435 --> 25:09.603
Why?

25:09.603 --> 25:11.063
Cash won't matter
if there aren't

25:11.063 --> 25:13.517
any soldiers left to buy.

25:13.607 --> 25:15.817
Mai Ling just absorbed
another tong.

25:17.402 --> 25:18.570
How is she making moves

25:18.570 --> 25:20.697
when we're out here
fighting for scraps?

25:20.697 --> 25:22.074
How doesn't matter.

25:22.074 --> 25:25.327
What matters is that Mai Ling
is building an army.

25:27.329 --> 25:30.249
She won't come
directly at us again.

25:30.249 --> 25:32.167
Not with this much heat
in the streets.

25:34.920 --> 25:38.257
Doesn't seem like she's
all that bothered by the heat.

25:38.257 --> 25:39.674
Does it?

26:12.082 --> 26:13.417
You know, if it weren't
for the tailored suits,

26:13.417 --> 26:16.170
I'd almost believe
this whole poultry setup.

26:16.170 --> 26:18.923
Former Officer Lee.

26:18.923 --> 26:22.759
I thought you were
Barbary Coast problem now.

26:22.759 --> 26:26.430
Not a lot of room in here
for contraband, Chao.

26:26.430 --> 26:29.766
Chinatown squad make
business bad for Chao.

26:29.766 --> 26:30.976
Turn over new leaf.

26:30.976 --> 26:32.352
Good.

26:32.352 --> 26:34.813
Then you won't mind
if I ask you a few questions.

26:36.690 --> 26:38.275
Too bad.

26:38.275 --> 26:40.652
I almost like you for a second.

26:40.652 --> 26:43.655
I'm looking into
a counterfeiting operation.

26:43.655 --> 26:45.574
Somebody printing
American greenbacks,

26:45.574 --> 26:46.951
possibly here in Chinatown.

26:46.951 --> 26:48.953
What I know
about printing money?

26:48.953 --> 26:50.662
I have a witness,

26:50.662 --> 26:52.206
part of the original
counterfeiting crew,

26:52.206 --> 26:55.334
says a Chinese man sold weapons
to his partners

26:55.334 --> 26:56.710
down at the docks

26:56.710 --> 26:58.921
shortly before
they were robbed.

26:58.921 --> 27:02.132
And you think this Chao?

27:02.132 --> 27:04.384
Given what I know about you,
I'd be foolish not to ask.

27:04.384 --> 27:06.470
You're foolish either way.

27:09.056 --> 27:12.392
Look, I'm not a cop anymore.

27:12.392 --> 27:16.640
I work for the government.
I can do things differently.

27:21.610 --> 27:24.154
Different how?

27:24.154 --> 27:27.616
You give me something useful,
you get paid.

27:27.616 --> 27:30.619
And I make sure
you stay out of jail.

27:30.619 --> 27:32.579
New badge, new rules.

27:33.830 --> 27:37.584
Sound like old rule
for snitch.

27:37.584 --> 27:39.044
I'm just asking you
to point me

27:39.044 --> 27:40.462
in the right direction.

27:42.214 --> 27:44.049
Exit that way.

29:15.432 --> 29:16.558
Took you guys long enough.

29:16.558 --> 29:17.935
I've been wandering
around your territory

29:17.935 --> 29:19.763
for, like, 20 minutes.

29:19.853 --> 29:21.188
Yeah, we knew.

29:21.188 --> 29:22.522
We just didn't care.

29:22.522 --> 29:24.441
Ah.

29:24.441 --> 29:26.770
Right, so you're the funny one.

29:26.860 --> 29:28.403
Which one of you's
the smart one?

29:31.490 --> 29:33.700
None of you. Got it.

29:33.700 --> 29:35.535
Enough.

29:48.215 --> 29:49.299
Hey, sis.

29:52.302 --> 29:55.799
I think my men are still
itchy about the other day.

29:55.889 --> 29:58.017
Oh, you mean
when you almost started a war

29:58.017 --> 30:00.435
by setting up shop
in our backyard?

30:00.435 --> 30:02.146
It was an honest mistake.

30:02.146 --> 30:04.189
Hop Wei territory is
shrinking by the day.

30:04.189 --> 30:05.900
Hard to know
who owns what anymore.

30:05.900 --> 30:10.195
Yeah, tough times all around
for everyone but you.

30:10.195 --> 30:11.947
Your point?

30:11.947 --> 30:13.865
Well, there are
no bulls here.

30:13.865 --> 30:15.951
No shutdowns or raids,
and you're parading around

30:15.951 --> 30:17.619
like the queen of Chinatown

30:17.619 --> 30:19.371
while everyone else suffers.

30:19.371 --> 30:21.165
It's a big world, Ah Sahm.

30:21.165 --> 30:22.958
Opportunities everywhere.

30:22.958 --> 30:25.085
Oh, my God.

30:25.085 --> 30:27.087
Do you have any idea--

30:27.087 --> 30:30.299
do you have any idea
how arrogant you sound?

30:31.716 --> 30:34.553
And you sound
like a sore loser.

30:39.808 --> 30:41.893
Listen, I don't know
who you made a deal with,

30:41.893 --> 30:43.020
but it's only a matter of time

30:43.020 --> 30:44.313
before it blows up
in your face,

30:44.313 --> 30:46.523
and when it does,

30:46.523 --> 30:49.693
Hop Wei will be
the least of your worries.

30:49.693 --> 30:54.114
The Hop Wei are
the least of my worries.

30:54.114 --> 30:57.910
Ever since Young Jun took over,
he's been doing my work for me.

30:57.910 --> 30:59.744
All I have to do is wait.

31:02.372 --> 31:04.333
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

31:05.834 --> 31:07.252
Ah Sahm.

31:11.673 --> 31:13.592
You don't have
to go down with him.

31:14.843 --> 31:16.470
I mean that.

31:18.763 --> 31:21.141
Don't worry.

31:21.141 --> 31:22.642
I won't.

31:33.695 --> 31:37.324
This man, he was friends
with your husband?

31:39.159 --> 31:41.870
I don't think
Douglas Strickland has friends.

31:41.870 --> 31:44.623
But he convinced Fred to invest
in his construction business

31:44.623 --> 31:46.875
just as the city
was taking off.

31:46.875 --> 31:49.336
And they made
a fortune together.

31:49.336 --> 31:52.214
And now he want your land.

31:52.214 --> 31:54.919
You know,
he used to want me too.

31:55.009 --> 31:58.053
I don't think he ever
got over the rejection.

31:58.053 --> 31:59.554
At least he have good taste.

32:08.272 --> 32:09.273
He can do this?

32:11.066 --> 32:13.360
Don't worry.

32:13.360 --> 32:15.070
Douglas likes
to puff out his chest,

32:15.070 --> 32:18.240
but he knows my lawyers can
tie him up for years.

32:18.240 --> 32:20.450
He'll find another route
for his railroad.

32:22.452 --> 32:26.290
Hey, I won't let anything
happen to our girls.

32:27.791 --> 32:29.954
And what if
he still want you?

32:31.128 --> 32:32.879
I didn't take you
for the jealous type.

32:34.423 --> 32:36.466
Not jealous.

32:36.466 --> 32:38.385
You two make
very handsome couple.

32:38.385 --> 32:39.886
Oh, shut up.

32:39.886 --> 32:41.221
He look like
he make good baby.

32:55.194 --> 32:57.196
Take this back
to your family, okay?

32:57.196 --> 32:59.739
Here you go.
Take it back to your family.

32:59.739 --> 33:00.908
Here you go.

33:00.908 --> 33:03.160
Don't spend it all at once.

33:03.160 --> 33:06.830
All right, take this back
to your mommy, okay?

33:19.801 --> 33:20.970
Hey.

33:22.596 --> 33:24.473
What's going on?

33:26.766 --> 33:29.394
Just helping out a few places
that got hit by the ordinances.

33:29.394 --> 33:30.729
Thank you.

33:30.729 --> 33:32.564
I figure the sooner
they're back up and running,

33:32.564 --> 33:33.565
the better.

33:33.565 --> 33:35.943
Check out
what he gave me, guys.

33:35.943 --> 33:37.111
It's a pipe!

33:37.111 --> 33:38.362
Huh.

33:38.362 --> 33:40.614
Since when
do you smoke a pipe, Hong?

33:40.614 --> 33:42.866
Since right fucking now,
I guess.

33:44.826 --> 33:46.161
- What's up?
- Nothing.

33:46.161 --> 33:48.413
I just thought
we were being careful.

33:48.413 --> 33:49.498
We are.

33:50.457 --> 33:52.417
Muscle and molasses.
That's what we agreed on.

33:52.417 --> 33:54.419
Not flooding the street
with fake chop.

33:54.419 --> 33:57.041
Okay, so you don't want me
roughing up old men,

33:57.131 --> 33:58.673
and you don't want me
giving them money either.

33:58.673 --> 34:00.300
I guess I don't know
what the fuck I'm doing,

34:00.300 --> 34:02.511
- do I?
- That's not what I'm saying.

34:02.511 --> 34:04.221
Oh, really?

34:04.221 --> 34:06.431
'Cause it sounded like
you were calling me out.

34:06.431 --> 34:08.725
Hey, guys, come on.
Take it easy.

34:10.894 --> 34:12.854
I'm not out here
swinging my dick

34:12.854 --> 34:14.439
for no reason, man.

34:15.900 --> 34:17.651
I'm washing the money.

34:17.651 --> 34:20.946
Businesses buy inventory
with the chop that I give them.

34:20.946 --> 34:22.406
Customers buy their shit,

34:22.406 --> 34:25.200
and real money flows
back into our pockets.

34:25.200 --> 34:28.787
And if a few fucking onions
think I'm God's gift,

34:28.787 --> 34:30.164
even better.

34:30.164 --> 34:32.332
Get me?

34:32.332 --> 34:35.169
Fuck, man.

34:35.169 --> 34:37.254
I know you're trying to help,

34:37.254 --> 34:40.340
but let me handle
the big picture shit, all right?

34:40.340 --> 34:42.384
You just make sure
that girl keeps printing.

34:42.384 --> 34:46.090
Because right now,
that's all that matters.

35:05.490 --> 35:07.159
How'd we do today?

35:07.159 --> 35:09.578
Same as yesterday.

35:09.578 --> 35:12.497
I can only go so fast
with six plates.

35:21.006 --> 35:22.507
I thought
you might be hungry.

35:32.434 --> 35:34.519
Thank you.

35:34.519 --> 35:36.021
You're welcome.

35:46.656 --> 35:49.153
Those--those are gonna be
some good ones.

35:49.243 --> 35:50.410
I can tell.

36:03.215 --> 36:04.383
These are terrible.

36:06.170 --> 36:07.136
What? No.

36:07.136 --> 36:09.763
Those are the best dumplings
in Chinatown.

36:09.763 --> 36:14.059
Yeah, maybe if you grew up
on a farm.

36:14.059 --> 36:16.270
I did grow up on a farm.

36:16.270 --> 36:18.230
That explains a lot.

36:18.230 --> 36:20.274
You have something
against farms?

36:20.274 --> 36:22.776
No, I have something
against these dumplings.

36:22.776 --> 36:24.188
I gotta get something else.

36:24.278 --> 36:27.822
Well, then I need
to come with you, so...

36:27.822 --> 36:30.993
if there's some top secret
dumpling spot, I need to know.

36:30.993 --> 36:33.620
Okay, suit yourself.

36:55.219 --> 36:56.893
Hmm.

36:56.893 --> 36:59.354
My father used to tell us
this one at bedtime.

36:59.354 --> 37:00.855
Do you know it?

37:00.855 --> 37:03.858
I didn't really have bedtime stories
growing up, you know?

37:05.569 --> 37:09.198
That's Lei Gong,
God of Thunder.

37:09.198 --> 37:11.783
Jade Emperor knew
that he was an angry god.

37:11.783 --> 37:15.120
So he gave him an axe

37:15.120 --> 37:17.372
and taught him
how to conjure thunder.

37:18.916 --> 37:22.336
But the problem was,
when he made his thunder,

37:22.336 --> 37:24.248
the skies got dark
and he couldn't always see

37:24.338 --> 37:25.464
what he was doing.

37:26.631 --> 37:29.134
One day, there was
a young girl named Dianmu

37:29.134 --> 37:31.095
throwing rice into the river.

37:31.095 --> 37:32.346
In his blind rage,

37:32.346 --> 37:35.259
Lei Gong accidentally
struck her down.

37:36.516 --> 37:39.353
He'd killed an innocent girl.

37:40.854 --> 37:42.564
And Jade Emperor was furious.

37:44.024 --> 37:45.692
So he resurrected Dianmu,

37:45.692 --> 37:48.612
making her
this powerful goddess.

37:48.612 --> 37:51.949
And as punishment,
Lei Gong had to marry her

37:51.949 --> 37:53.408
so she could help him.

37:53.408 --> 37:56.661
And she held mirrors
in the sky,

37:56.661 --> 38:00.332
making lightning
so he could see.

38:04.086 --> 38:09.008
And that is why lightning
always comes before thunder.

38:11.135 --> 38:12.844
So it has a happy ending.

38:14.846 --> 38:16.974
- How is that happy?
- Well, think about it.

38:16.974 --> 38:19.393
I mean, a love story. Mm.

38:19.393 --> 38:22.062
She made
the thunder monster better.

38:22.062 --> 38:24.481
Better at killing.

38:24.481 --> 38:27.401
And it's not like she had
a choice in the matter either.

38:29.736 --> 38:31.530
Nobody gets a choice.

38:31.530 --> 38:34.741
Or maybe you just don't like
the choice you made.

38:39.038 --> 38:41.748
I saw you at the riot.

38:43.583 --> 38:47.331
You came in
like some avenging angel.

38:49.006 --> 38:51.091
Here to save us.

38:53.135 --> 38:55.971
But then you come to my shop
with Young Jun to collect,

38:55.971 --> 38:59.224
and...

39:00.935 --> 39:04.646
I realized you're not an angel
or a warrior.

39:04.646 --> 39:06.315
You're just...

39:08.525 --> 39:10.485
Some hatchet man.

39:22.664 --> 39:24.624
Sorry to let you down.

39:31.006 --> 39:34.009
Well,
maybe it's not too late.

39:36.220 --> 39:38.055
For what?

39:39.598 --> 39:41.934
For you
to choose differently.

39:51.318 --> 39:54.529
You sing, you dance

39:54.529 --> 39:58.492
You love to romance

39:58.492 --> 40:01.870
You seem to know
just what it's all about

40:01.870 --> 40:04.623
Ooh, baby, you knock me out

40:04.623 --> 40:08.002
When you roll your eyes,
I seem hypnotized

40:08.002 --> 40:11.213
Everything you do
thrills me through and through

40:11.213 --> 40:14.883
So if that's the way,
then I have to say

40:14.883 --> 40:17.344
I'll always be loving you

40:17.344 --> 40:20.389
You kiss

40:20.389 --> 40:24.476
<i>You smile, and yes</i>

40:24.476 --> 40:27.771
<i>I'll always love you,
but I'm still in doubt</i>

40:27.771 --> 40:31.108
<i>Ooh, baby,
you knock me out</i>

40:31.108 --> 40:32.943
- Is this your room?
- Mm-hmm.

40:51.128 --> 40:53.088
Oh.

40:53.088 --> 40:55.424
Oh, fuck.

41:00.262 --> 41:04.141
Okay, is the pipe authentic
or an affectation?

41:04.141 --> 41:05.892
What's an affectation?

41:08.395 --> 41:11.648
Well, you seem pretty fresh.
How long ago did you cross?

41:11.648 --> 41:13.317
A few months ago.

41:14.401 --> 41:16.778
To be a hatchet man?

41:16.778 --> 41:18.613
No.

41:18.613 --> 41:22.993
I've been in a tong ever since
my father kicked me out.

41:22.993 --> 41:24.488
I was 14.

41:29.249 --> 41:30.750
Where's your family?

41:32.794 --> 41:34.296
My mom was indentured

41:34.296 --> 41:37.674
to a commodore
in the Royal Navy.

41:37.674 --> 41:40.094
He traveled a lot,
so we did too.

41:41.470 --> 41:43.931
After she died,

41:43.931 --> 41:46.600
he didn't have any use for me.

41:46.600 --> 41:48.643
Been on my own ever since.

41:52.147 --> 41:56.026
It must be hard to be alone
in all those places.

41:56.026 --> 41:59.404
It's different for artists,
I think.

41:59.404 --> 42:03.325
We're more accepting than most.

42:05.619 --> 42:07.997
Besides,
you can't be an immigrant

42:07.997 --> 42:10.207
if you never stay in one place.

42:18.465 --> 42:20.425
- Oh, hang on!
- Oh!

42:20.425 --> 42:22.594
Ow.

42:29.309 --> 42:32.271
Leary, I've been waiting
to hear from you.

42:32.271 --> 42:34.606
Did you speak
with Mr. Strickland?

42:34.606 --> 42:37.484
- We spoke.
- And?

42:37.484 --> 42:38.610
Didn't go your way.

42:38.610 --> 42:40.654
What the hell's
that supposed to mean?

42:40.654 --> 42:42.990
Hey! I asked you a question.

42:42.990 --> 42:45.784
Ah, God!

42:45.784 --> 42:47.494
God!

42:47.494 --> 42:50.497
This isn't your house,
you pasty fuck.

42:50.497 --> 42:52.124
It's mine.

42:52.124 --> 42:54.793
And when you're in my house,

42:54.793 --> 42:56.378
you show me
some fucking respect.

42:56.378 --> 42:58.838
Oh, son of a bitch!

42:58.838 --> 43:00.340
I'll have you arrested.

43:00.340 --> 43:02.342
I suppose you need
a cop, then.

43:02.342 --> 43:04.344
Owen, get over here.

43:08.807 --> 43:10.434
What's the problem?

43:10.434 --> 43:12.352
This man attacked me.

43:12.352 --> 43:13.597
Hmm?

43:15.147 --> 43:16.481
Any witnesses?

43:16.481 --> 43:18.901
What do you mean?
Of course there are witnesses.

43:20.485 --> 43:22.321
Mm-mm-mm.

43:25.824 --> 43:27.742
I won't forget this.

43:30.120 --> 43:31.615
That was the intention.

43:46.011 --> 43:47.346
Here you go.

43:49.181 --> 43:52.351
Well, thanks
for walking me home.

43:52.351 --> 43:54.728
You really didn't have to.

43:54.728 --> 43:57.731
No, I--no, I did.

43:57.731 --> 44:00.275
I'm supposed to keep
an eye on you, remember?

44:00.275 --> 44:02.361
Right.

44:02.361 --> 44:05.822
So I guess you gotta
frisk me too, then.

44:05.822 --> 44:07.574
Uh, oh--uh, yeah.

44:22.547 --> 44:23.757
Just--

44:47.239 --> 44:48.865
You're good.

44:52.244 --> 44:53.996
Well, good night, then.

45:01.045 --> 45:02.212
Good night.

46:04.691 --> 46:06.735
Girls are going to bed.

46:06.735 --> 46:08.028
Dinner is all cleaned up.

46:09.363 --> 46:11.949
Just you and me now.

46:11.949 --> 46:13.867
You must be tired.

46:13.867 --> 46:15.827
I am.

46:15.827 --> 46:17.913
But the good kind, you know?

46:23.418 --> 46:24.836
I'm gonna draw a bath, I think.

46:24.836 --> 46:26.588
Mm.

46:26.588 --> 46:27.839
Good idea.

46:34.513 --> 46:36.306
Hey, go to that field.

46:38.308 --> 46:39.768
Get gun.

46:39.768 --> 46:41.395
Go, go!

46:57.786 --> 46:58.822
Huh?

47:01.248 --> 47:03.375
The fields. Go.

47:04.876 --> 47:06.336
Put her down.

47:57.096 --> 47:58.138
Get up, bitch!

50:30.249 --> 50:33.210
Shaw, let's go!
We've been here too long!
