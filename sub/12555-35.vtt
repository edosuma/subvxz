05:44.052 --> 05:47.135
THAT'S A LITTLE
DIFFICULT TO SAY.

05:47.222 --> 05:48.838
WELL, GUESS.

05:48.932 --> 05:50.263
WHAT I MEAN IS

05:50.350 --> 05:51.636
IT'S HARD TO
BE CHRONOLOGICAL

05:51.726 --> 05:53.637
WHEN DISCUSSING
CASEY'S AGE

05:53.687 --> 05:57.055
BECAUSE HE'S ONLY BEEN
IN EXISTENCE THREE WEEKS.

05:57.148 --> 05:59.685
WHAT I MEAN IS THAT
HE HAS THE PHYSIQUE

05:59.776 --> 06:01.892
AND THE MIND
OF A BOY OF 22.

06:01.987 --> 06:04.479

LONG HE'S BEEN HERE

06:04.531 --> 06:09.651

HE'S ROUGH, DOC,
HE'S PLENTY ROUGH

08:28.133 --> 08:30.500
BUT I THINK WE CAN
GIVE HIM A TRY.

08:30.593 --> 08:34.052
HE'S A ROBOT,
YOU KNOW.

08:34.139 --> 08:35.971
DON'T EVER SAY THAT.

08:36.015 --> 08:37.972
THAT'S ONE WE'LL JUST KEEP
IN THE FAMILY HERE.

08:38.058 --> 08:41.722

08:53.074 --> 08:55.156
I WAS TELLING THE DOC
YOU'RE A LITTLE ROUGH

08:55.243 --> 08:56.654
BUT WE'LL
WORK THAT OUT.

08:56.703 --> 08:58.364
I THINK WE'LL

12:15.693 --> 12:17.604
NOW IN ORDER

12:17.695 --> 12:19.732
I HAD TO HAVE HIM

15:49.282 --> 15:50.864
<i>THAT'S MY
FINAL DECISION.</i>

15:50.950 --> 15:53.738
COMMISSIONER, TO ALL
INTENTS AND PURPOSES

15:53.828 --> 15:55.660
HE IS HUMAN!

15:55.746 --> 15:57.612
CASEY...

15:57.707 --> 16:00.244

16:00.334 --> 16:02.621
TELL HIM
ABOUT YOURSELF.

16:02.712 --> 16:04.498
WHAT SHOULD I SAY?

16:04.589 --> 16:05.954
SEE? HE TALKS
BETTER THAN ME

16:06.048 --> 16:07.584
AND HE'S A
LOT SMARTER

16:07.675 --> 16:08.836
THAN MOST OF
THOSE MUTTONHEADS.

16:08.926 --> 16:10.178
HE IS NOT HUMAN!

16:10.261 --> 16:11.968
HOW HUMAN DO
YOU WANT HIM?

16:12.054 --> 16:14.842
HE'S GOT ARMS AND LEGS

HE DOESN'T EVEN
OWN A HEART.

16:17.935 --> 16:19.346
HOVV COULD HE BE HUMAN
VVITHOUT A HEART?

16:19.437 --> 16:21.178
BEASLEY HASN'T GOT
A HEART EITHER.

16:21.272 --> 16:23.058
HE OWNS 40%

16:23.149 --> 16:24.389
<i>THAT'S IT. HE DOESN'T
HAVE A HEART</i>

16:24.484 --> 16:25.690
THAT MEANS
HE ISN'T HUMAN.

16:25.776 --> 16:26.937
THAT'S A
CLEAR VIOLATION

16:27.028 --> 16:28.018
OF THE
BASEBALL CODE.

16:28.112 --> 16:29.193
HE DOESN'T PLAY.

16:29.280 --> 16:31.146
MR. COMMISSIONER

16:31.240 --> 16:33.197
