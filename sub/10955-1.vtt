WEBVTT

00:41.332 --> 00:44.293
You were right.

00:44.460 --> 00:46.796
This is definitely better
than being at work.

00:46.963 --> 00:50.967
One thing you didn't warn us
about though, bloody midges.

00:51.133 --> 00:53.636
Be a big girl's blouse.

00:53.803 --> 00:56.305
Anyway, now that
you've mentioned work,

00:56.472 --> 00:57.932
and seeing that I bullied you

00:58.140 --> 01:00.726
to come all the way out
here to celebrate the fact...

01:06.274 --> 01:08.234
Here.

01:08.401 --> 01:10.528
Congratulations.

01:10.695 --> 01:13.197
No knight should be
without his sword.

01:15.992 --> 01:17.201
I don't know what to say.

01:17.368 --> 01:20.037
My writer lost for words?

01:20.204 --> 01:21.539
It's perfect.

01:21.706 --> 01:24.875
Yeah, and it's also solid
silver, so don't lose it.

03:25.162 --> 03:27.915
Nice try, Private Cooper.

03:28.082 --> 03:31.293
You evaded capture for 22 hours

03:31.460 --> 03:33.629
and 47 minutes.

03:33.796 --> 03:36.549
You're straight to
the head of the class.

03:36.716 --> 03:39.176
Of course the real
trick to survival

03:39.343 --> 03:41.303
lies not in running and hiding,

03:41.470 --> 03:45.683
but in removing your enemy's
capacity to hunt you down.

03:50.438 --> 03:53.232
Here. Shoot the dog.

03:56.527 --> 03:58.779
I'm sorry, sir, what?

04:00.156 --> 04:02.783
Take the weapon and use it.

04:04.910 --> 04:09.457
During the selection process,
you are under my command.

04:09.623 --> 04:12.460
That's a direct order, Cooper.

04:14.211 --> 04:15.921
You're taking a piss, right?

04:16.088 --> 04:17.423
He thinks I'm pulling his leg.

04:17.630 --> 04:19.382
Do I look like a sodding
comedian shitwank?

04:19.550 --> 04:21.802
No, sir.

04:23.846 --> 04:25.306
I still won't do it.

04:25.473 --> 04:29.101
You don't have a choice.
Finish the job. Shoot the clog.

04:30.561 --> 04:31.604
Shoot it!

04:31.771 --> 04:33.105
No, sir!

04:36.525 --> 04:39.653
What use are you to my team

04:39.820 --> 04:42.740
if you can't even kill a clog?

04:42.907 --> 04:45.826
I didn't say
I couldn't kill a dog, sir.

04:45.993 --> 04:48.621
I just will not kill
that dog for no reason.

04:50.581 --> 04:53.626
You're bent, Cooper. I don't
need a man of conscience.

04:53.793 --> 04:55.085
You're failing me for this?

04:55.252 --> 04:56.921
You failed yourself.

04:59.048 --> 05:01.801
We're on a different
level here, Cooper.

05:03.177 --> 05:06.347
For that, I need men of action.

05:07.515 --> 05:09.016
Not deeds.

05:12.311 --> 05:13.938
No!

05:15.064 --> 05:16.941
You sick fucking bastard.

05:17.107 --> 05:19.109
It was just a dog.
That's all.

05:20.528 --> 05:24.073
Maybe one day when that's
sunk into your thick skull,

05:24.240 --> 05:27.076
you'll be ready for us.

05:27.243 --> 05:29.620
Until then, you live and learn.

05:29.787 --> 05:31.831
Yeah. You don't.

05:38.754 --> 05:41.715
I don't do second
chances, Cooper.

05:42.758 --> 05:45.302
And I never forget.

05:48.389 --> 05:51.934
R.T.U this
pathetic piece of shit.

05:54.520 --> 05:55.896
Send him back to his squad.

06:54.496 --> 06:56.707
I want a good clean dispersal

06:56.874 --> 06:58.709
and a secure landing zone.

07:00.294 --> 07:02.254
Go! go, go go, go.

07:10.179 --> 07:11.847
Joe, get out of the chopper.

07:12.014 --> 07:14.516
I'm not missing the footy
for this, it's totally bone!

07:14.683 --> 07:16.268
I'm not going, sir,
I'm not going!

07:44.505 --> 07:46.173
They're "P-

07:54.890 --> 07:57.267
Cooper. I want a
position and bearing.

07:57.476 --> 07:59.728
Want to make a move
in three minutes.

07:59.895 --> 08:01.230
On it, Sarge.

08:01.397 --> 08:03.232
Spoon, Terry, you're on stag.

08:03.399 --> 08:05.442
Joe, for fuck's sake.

08:05.609 --> 08:09.238
Get off your big fat lardy
ass and make like a soldier.

08:11.281 --> 08:14.743
Right then.
Time sync.

08:16.161 --> 08:18.956
I've got 0730
coming up in three,

08:19.123 --> 08:20.916
two, one.
Check.

08:21.083 --> 08:22.626
Bollocks. I don't
believe this.

08:22.793 --> 08:24.211
What is it now, Witherspoon?

08:24.378 --> 08:26.296
Left me watch at
the barracks, Sarge.

08:26.463 --> 08:27.965
Take a breather every
once in a while, son.

08:28.173 --> 08:29.216
You'll live longer.

08:29.425 --> 08:30.426
Nice work, Spoon, you tosser.

08:30.634 --> 08:32.219
Took the words
right off my mouth.

08:32.385 --> 08:33.511
And you'll be taking my boot out

08:33.721 --> 08:35.304
of your mouth in a minute,
Joe, you baldy twat.

08:35.472 --> 08:37.224
- I'm pissed now.

08:37.390 --> 08:39.143
This shite is totally bone.

08:39.308 --> 08:40.644
The most important
football match

08:40.852 --> 08:42.020
of my life is playing tonight

08:42.187 --> 08:43.938
and I'm stuck at the
back side of beyond

08:44.148 --> 08:45.941
without so much
as a six pack or a telly.

08:46.108 --> 08:47.443
That's the army for you.

08:47.609 --> 08:50.154
It's England v. Germany,
man. Full on footy war.

08:50.320 --> 08:52.448
Yeah, well, it's nothing like
this at all then, is it, Joe?

08:52.614 --> 08:55.284
It's just an exercise.
Hardly life or death.

08:55.451 --> 08:57.411
Don't bet on it, Joe.
You're fucking slaying me.

08:57.619 --> 08:58.871
If you'd paid
any attention at all

08:59.079 --> 09:00.456
during the briefing, Kirkley,

09:00.622 --> 09:01.915
you'd know exactly
who we're up against

09:02.124 --> 09:03.542
on this harmless little
exercise, wouldn't you?

09:03.709 --> 09:04.918
And who's that, then?

09:05.085 --> 09:07.087
Special Forces, you plunker.

09:07.254 --> 09:08.297
Bollocks to them.

09:08.464 --> 09:10.924
All right. All right.
Now listen up.

09:11.091 --> 09:13.218
I'm gonna make this
quick and to the point.

09:13.385 --> 09:14.511
Just like you, all I wanna do

09:14.720 --> 09:16.096
is get home,
jump into a warm bed

09:16.263 --> 09:18.307
with a nice hot woman
and watch the footy.

09:18.474 --> 09:20.017
Planning on scoring, Sarge?

09:20.184 --> 09:22.519
Mind you don't foul her
in the penalty box.

09:22.686 --> 09:24.521
All right. Ban it,
private parts.

09:24.688 --> 09:26.774
As for this moment
as far as we're concerned,

09:26.940 --> 09:28.650
we are 50k behind enemy lines.

09:28.859 --> 09:31.153
Now, if we do happen
to make a contact,

09:31.320 --> 09:32.738
I expect nothing less than

09:32.946 --> 09:35.115
gratuitous violence
from the lot of you.

09:35.282 --> 09:36.492
As we're firing blanks,

09:36.700 --> 09:39.411
it doesn't mean we have to
be thinking nice thoughts.

09:39.578 --> 09:41.330
So, you remember,
you put five down.

09:41.497 --> 09:43.207
You get stuck in,
you kick their fucking

09:43.415 --> 09:44.833
teeth out or
I guarantee you, Joe,

09:45.000 --> 09:47.252
they'll be having your bollocks
for breakfast, sunshine.

09:47.419 --> 09:49.213
Hard boiled or fried, Sarge?

09:49.379 --> 09:50.839
Scrambled.

09:51.006 --> 09:52.341
Here, Spoonie.

09:52.549 --> 09:54.218
Oh, smart.

09:54.426 --> 09:55.719
Though it's nice
and new and shiny

09:55.928 --> 09:56.929
it doesn't mean it's worth shit.

09:57.137 --> 09:58.305
Remember I want that back, son.

09:58.472 --> 10:00.307
What about you, Sarge?

10:00.474 --> 10:02.226
Well, I'll count.

10:02.392 --> 10:04.645
Right then, Coop, what we got?

10:07.147 --> 10:09.858
We're here. The front
line is here.

10:10.025 --> 10:13.195
A.W.A.C.K reports enemy
positions here, here and here,

10:13.362 --> 10:14.696
with sweeping patrols
between each

10:14.947 --> 10:15.864
of these forward bunkers.

10:16.031 --> 10:18.033
They have the whole sector
wrapped tighter

10:18.242 --> 10:19.368
than an Eskimo's nutsack.

10:19.535 --> 10:21.578
With one exception right here.

10:21.745 --> 10:25.332
A river crosses the line through
a gorge 30 or 40 feet deep.

10:25.499 --> 10:27.793
It's certain to have a patrol
on it but if we go at night,

10:27.960 --> 10:30.337
tread careful and don't
mind getting our feet wet,

10:30.504 --> 10:33.090
I reckon we can make it through.

10:33.257 --> 10:35.092
What the fuck is
all this about then?

10:35.259 --> 10:37.344
With my luck lately I need
all the help I can get.

10:37.511 --> 10:40.139
Hey, listen. I know you think
it was a piss pool cooled you.

10:40.305 --> 10:44.935
Failing selection and all that,
but I got to say I'm not sorry.

10:45.102 --> 10:47.354
This squad would be a lot
worse off without you, mate.

10:47.521 --> 10:48.939
Something I had to do, you know.

10:49.106 --> 10:50.607
For myself, get it
out the system.

10:50.774 --> 10:53.902
Look, the only people going
into trouble are Kamikazes,

10:54.069 --> 10:57.114
glory boys and full
on fucking fatwits.

10:57.281 --> 11:00.325
Take my advice, son.
Be patient.

11:00.492 --> 11:03.120
Right then, ladies.
Pack up your troubles,

11:03.287 --> 11:05.872
put your brains in first
gear and start tabbing.

11:05.873 --> 11:08.792
Spoonie, you're on point.
Terry, Joe, tail in Charlie's.

11:12.004 --> 11:14.506
Over here, Cooper.
On me head.

11:15.883 --> 11:17.384
Twater.

11:17.551 --> 11:20.721
I can't believe I'm missing
the footy for this party.

11:20.888 --> 11:22.097
Joe, if you don't shut up,

11:22.306 --> 11:24.224
I swear to God I'm gonna
fucking slot you myself.

11:24.433 --> 11:25.434
Now, move.

11:25.642 --> 11:27.519
Didn't say a word, Sarge.

11:32.566 --> 11:34.109
Where the hell are we now?

12:00.344 --> 12:02.846
I heard a cracking
story about this place.

12:03.013 --> 12:04.473
You what?

12:04.640 --> 12:06.975
People disappear out here.
It happens all the time.

12:07.184 --> 12:08.560
Come on, Cooper.
Give it some bollocks.

12:08.769 --> 12:09.770
It's true.

12:09.978 --> 12:12.648
Just last month a young couple
were hiking through these woods.

12:12.856 --> 12:14.900
They set up camp
somewhere near here.

12:15.108 --> 12:17.069
During the night,
something happened.

12:17.236 --> 12:19.238
A rescue team found
the remains of the camp

12:19.446 --> 12:20.405
a couple of days later.

12:20.572 --> 12:24.493
The tent was ripped to threads
and there was blood everywhere.

12:24.660 --> 12:26.370
The papers said
it was a monster,

12:26.578 --> 12:28.080
like the beast of Bodmin Moor.

12:28.247 --> 12:30.999
The locals claimed
it was an escaped lunatic.

12:31.166 --> 12:32.626
But no one's been caught,

12:32.834 --> 12:35.003
so nothing could
be proved either way.

12:35.170 --> 12:37.673
Every year, more and more
people come through here.

12:37.839 --> 12:41.301
Every once in a while they don't
come back. No trace, no bodies.

12:41.468 --> 12:45.305
Just disappear and
never seen again.

12:47.140 --> 12:48.809
Oh!

13:31.393 --> 13:33.145
Contact camp.

13:33.312 --> 13:36.273
Tell them the flock is
heading for the fold.

13:44.448 --> 13:46.658
Well then, Bruce,
what scares you?

13:46.825 --> 13:49.745
The self-destructive nature
of the human condition.

13:49.911 --> 13:51.705
Just taking a piss now.

13:51.872 --> 13:53.165
You think so?

13:53.332 --> 13:54.583
What about you, Spoon?

13:54.750 --> 13:56.501
Castration.

13:58.837 --> 14:00.922
There's no argument
there. Joe?

14:01.089 --> 14:04.051
Only one thing going to
put the shit out of me:

14:04.259 --> 14:05.427
A penalty shoot-out.

14:05.594 --> 14:07.929
That figures.
Terry?

14:08.096 --> 14:12.267
Watching a penalty
shoot-out... with Joe.

14:14.394 --> 14:15.479
What about you, Coop?

14:15.645 --> 14:18.273
Spiders.
And women.

14:19.983 --> 14:23.153
And, uh, spider women.

14:24.613 --> 14:26.990
I want to know
what scares the Sarge.

14:27.157 --> 14:29.659
Piss of, man. Nothing
scares the Sarge.

14:29.826 --> 14:31.703
I don't know about that.

14:31.912 --> 14:33.288
The thought of never
seeing my wife again

14:33.497 --> 14:35.248
scares the shit out of me.

14:37.626 --> 14:40.754
That and those little things
that make your skin crawl

14:40.921 --> 14:43.298
and the hairs stand up
at the back of your neck.

14:43.465 --> 14:45.342
You mean like Spoon?

14:47.886 --> 14:49.679
No, there's one thing,
actually, in particular

14:49.888 --> 14:51.765
that I'll remember
until the day that I die.

14:53.100 --> 14:56.770
It's back in '91, just before
my unit was flying out to Kuwait

14:56.937 --> 14:59.564
to mop up the last
pockets of resistance.

14:59.731 --> 15:03.276
Me and this young fellow
called Eddie Oswald

15:03.443 --> 15:05.112
decided to go and
get a tattoo done

15:05.320 --> 15:07.614
to commemorate our
first trip into the desert.

15:07.781 --> 15:11.034
I remember Ed.
He was a stocky hard case

15:11.201 --> 15:13.370
with a broken nose
and a bone eye, eh?

15:13.537 --> 15:16.915
Yeah, that's him. Good-looking
fellow. Big hit with the ladies.

15:19.459 --> 15:21.461
Anyway, me and Eddie,

15:21.628 --> 15:24.423
we had a few drinks.
We had a lot of drinks.

15:24.589 --> 15:26.299
And we went down
to the tattoo parlor,

15:26.508 --> 15:27.676
and I got a desert rat done.

15:27.843 --> 15:30.720
And Eddie being Eddie wanted
something a bit more meaning.

15:30.887 --> 15:33.306
And being a bit of a believer,

15:33.473 --> 15:37.352
he said that his soul
still belonged to God.

15:37.519 --> 15:41.731
But his flesh was way
beyond redemption.

15:41.898 --> 15:45.277
It was up to Satan
to save his skin.

15:45.444 --> 15:48.071
So he got this fucking
great laughing devil tattoo,

15:48.280 --> 15:49.281
right on his ass.

15:51.491 --> 15:53.076
Anyway, about six days later,
we were making

15:53.285 --> 15:55.203
a regular sweep along the,
uh, Iraqi border.

15:55.996 --> 16:00.750
And, uh, Eddie, poor fucker,
triggered an antitank mine.

16:02.669 --> 16:05.922
Yeah. We all saw it
happen. He was on point.

16:06.089 --> 16:08.675
A white, blinding
lightning flash

16:08.842 --> 16:10.218
and a fucking deafening crack.

16:10.427 --> 16:12.596
By the time we picked
ourselves up off the deck,

16:12.762 --> 16:14.473
Eddie was...

16:15.932 --> 16:17.601
He was gone.

16:18.727 --> 16:20.437
Just bits and pieces of him.

16:20.604 --> 16:21.938
It's all that remained.

16:22.147 --> 16:24.858
This big fucking red circle
a hundred meters.

16:27.235 --> 16:28.653
I'll tell you something, lads.

16:28.862 --> 16:30.572
It really puts
things in perspective

16:30.780 --> 16:32.324
when you have to
scoop your mate up

16:32.532 --> 16:34.493
with a shovel and
stick him in a bin bag.

16:35.452 --> 16:39.664
Anyway, the thing that really
did our nuts in that day

16:39.831 --> 16:44.336
was when you, uh, came
across the bit you recognized.

16:46.421 --> 16:50.050
A bit of an ear,
a toe, a nose, a tooth.

16:51.718 --> 16:54.346
The thing that really
freaked us out that day

16:54.513 --> 16:56.306
was when left-hand Charlie found

16:56.515 --> 16:58.350
a bit of Eddie
with the tattoo on.

16:58.558 --> 16:59.935
I mean, everything else was
burned to a crisp

17:00.143 --> 17:01.144
covered in claret.

17:01.353 --> 17:02.646
All mushed up, pocked up.

17:02.854 --> 17:06.483
Not this bit.
This bit was perfect.

17:06.650 --> 17:10.362
And there's old Nick chortling
his fucking ass all off at us.

17:12.821 --> 17:15.116
So you could say
that Eddie was right.

17:15.282 --> 17:20.914
That Satan did indeed save
his skin, just not all of it.

17:21.080 --> 17:23.916
Or you could say that
Eddie was just unlucky.

17:25.669 --> 17:28.213
Either way...

17:28.380 --> 17:31.508
It taught me to keep
a very open mind.

17:33.260 --> 17:34.970
Boom, boom.

17:39.015 --> 17:40.559
Anyway-

17:42.769 --> 17:44.563
Eddie Oswald.

17:45.605 --> 17:47.065
- To Eddie.
- To Eddie.

17:58.201 --> 18:00.203
So anyway, this bloke
walks into a pub, right,

18:00.370 --> 18:01.871
with a dog under his arm.

18:02.080 --> 18:04.749
Puts his arm on the bar,
goes and sits down.

18:04.958 --> 18:05.959
The bartender is
looking and thinking,

18:06.167 --> 18:07.002
"What the hell's going on here?"

18:07.794 --> 18:09.838
He looks back at the dog and
he's surprised. The clog turns...

18:10.839 --> 18:12.215
Fucking cow!

18:13.967 --> 18:16.636
Ceasefire, Terry.
Ceasefire.

18:16.803 --> 18:18.638
Terry, what the hell
are you doing?

18:18.805 --> 18:20.140
You're firing blanks, man.

18:20.307 --> 18:22.017
Is everyone all right?
Is everyone okay?

18:22.183 --> 18:24.060
No. I think
I've shit meself.

18:26.980 --> 18:28.398
Is it dead?

18:28.565 --> 18:30.567
Oh, yeah, it's dead alright.

18:30.734 --> 18:32.861
Look at the state of it.

18:33.028 --> 18:34.571
Look at the state of Terry.

18:36.740 --> 18:40.452
These aren't entry wounds.
More like teeth marks.

18:40.619 --> 18:42.120
What are you saying, Cooper?

18:42.287 --> 18:44.998
What he's saying, Terry, is it
died of natural causes, mate.

18:45.165 --> 18:47.334
Don't you think we should
call this in, Sarge?

18:47.500 --> 18:49.502
Aye. Go on
the radio, Bruce.

18:49.669 --> 18:51.921
There's no way I'm about
to break radio silence

18:52.088 --> 18:55.675
'cause you lot got spooked
by a dead flying fucking cow.

18:55.842 --> 18:57.093
No, we have this position.

18:57.302 --> 18:58.970
We keep it secure
'til the morning.

18:59.137 --> 19:01.765
Then we reassess the situation.

19:01.931 --> 19:03.892
Right. I want
a watch posted.

19:04.059 --> 19:06.561
Two on. Four off. Brucie,
Spoon. You're up first.

19:06.728 --> 19:08.897
Cooper and I relieve
at 0100 hours.

19:09.064 --> 19:12.609
In the meantime, Terry,
sort your kit out.

19:12.776 --> 19:15.862
The rest of you
get your heads down.

19:16.029 --> 19:17.614
Unbelievable.

20:08.415 --> 20:09.499
Sarge?

20:14.129 --> 20:16.005
Cow came in from this direction,

20:16.214 --> 20:17.424
straight off the edge.

20:19.509 --> 20:21.261
Out of the frying pan,
into the fire.

20:21.428 --> 20:22.220
Bleeding to death,

20:22.429 --> 20:25.098
it could've wandered around
for miles before it got here.

20:25.265 --> 20:27.976
It's good of it to leave some
breadcrumbs for us to follow.

20:28.143 --> 20:29.269
Looking for trouble?

20:29.436 --> 20:31.312
No, Cooper.
Just looking.

20:31.479 --> 20:34.816
Sarge, shouldn't we just report
this when we get back?

20:35.024 --> 20:36.735
You're too fucking right, Terry,
but in the meantime

20:36.943 --> 20:38.737
I'm curious,
and it's on the way.

20:38.945 --> 20:40.405
Come on, lads.

21:44.177 --> 21:46.805
Natural causes my ass.

21:48.515 --> 21:50.975
Oh, now what?

22:40.650 --> 22:43.611
Christ on a pike.

22:43.778 --> 22:46.114
What the fucking hell
happened here, Sarge?

22:46.281 --> 22:49.492
This is getting more
bone by the minute.

22:49.659 --> 22:51.870
Jesus Christ, Sarge.

22:52.036 --> 22:54.831
All right, lads.
Get a grip.

22:56.416 --> 22:58.418
We've got casualties to locate.

22:58.585 --> 23:00.253
So ditch your bar guns.

23:00.420 --> 23:04.591
Salvage whatever weapons
you can find, and stand to.

23:04.757 --> 23:09.262
We are now up against
live, hostile targets.

23:09.429 --> 23:11.389
So if Little Red Riding Hood
should show up

23:11.598 --> 23:13.057
with a bazooka
and a bad attitude,

23:13.266 --> 23:15.310
I'd expect you
to chin the bitch.

23:16.811 --> 23:18.354
Looks like they got
hit hard and fast.

23:18.563 --> 23:20.690
Every magazine is full.
Nobody got off a single round.

23:20.857 --> 23:23.318
If they're lost, then
where are the bodies?

23:25.236 --> 23:28.448
Yeah. All right, Corporal.
Get on the net. Call in.

23:28.656 --> 23:30.450
I want an emergency
air lift immediately.

23:30.658 --> 23:31.826
I'm on it.

23:38.625 --> 23:40.043
Help me.

23:41.711 --> 23:43.796
Captain?

23:43.963 --> 23:46.257
Ryan? What
happened here?

23:46.424 --> 23:48.468
Do not tell me
you fucking know him.

23:48.635 --> 23:50.553
Captain Ryan, Special Ops.

23:50.720 --> 23:53.765
No fucking dog lover.

23:55.600 --> 23:58.436
Spearhead patrol. This is
spearhead patrol. Receiving?

23:58.603 --> 24:01.064
He looks like he took on
Jack the Ripper and came last.

24:01.230 --> 24:03.524
I can patch him up, but
he needs a medic right now.

24:03.691 --> 24:05.568
This is an
emergency. Code 64.

24:05.735 --> 24:08.363
You gotta get me out of
here. Do you understand?

24:08.529 --> 24:10.198
There was only
supposed to be one.

24:10.365 --> 24:12.033
We're working on it, Captain.

24:12.200 --> 24:13.159
Sarge.

24:13.326 --> 24:14.577
Not now, Spoon.

24:14.744 --> 24:16.537
You're receiving?

24:18.414 --> 24:19.457
Shit.

24:19.624 --> 24:20.833
What's wrong, Bruce?

24:21.000 --> 24:22.335
I can't find a signal.

24:22.502 --> 24:24.128
Did you check it?

24:24.295 --> 24:26.673
Of course, and I double
checked it and it worked fine!

24:26.839 --> 24:29.342
All right, Bruce, stay on
it. See what you can do.

24:29.509 --> 24:31.678
Terry? They must've
had their own comms kit.

24:31.844 --> 24:33.805
Have a look round. See
if you can find it. Go.

24:34.013 --> 24:35.056
- Sarge.
- Spoon.

24:35.264 --> 24:36.724
Have a shift around the camp.

24:36.933 --> 24:38.267
See if you can
find anything else useful.

24:38.476 --> 24:40.812
- Yeah, but...
- Not now, Spoon!

24:41.020 --> 24:43.481
This is spearhead patrol,
are you receiving me?

24:46.359 --> 24:48.861
There was only
supposed to be one.

24:49.028 --> 24:51.781
Jesus! Charnel House
is compromised to fuck!

24:53.366 --> 24:54.742
The hell is he doing here?

24:54.909 --> 24:57.036
All I know is
he's special forces.

24:57.203 --> 25:00.540
If this is part of our exercise,
it's been not advertised.

25:00.707 --> 25:03.710
No cap badge, no insignia.
Just tags.

25:03.876 --> 25:05.712
Some kind of a covert action?

25:05.878 --> 25:09.215
Covert action or not, they're
packing all kinds of weird shit.

25:09.382 --> 25:12.719
Tranquilizer darts,
nets, you name it.

25:12.885 --> 25:15.930
It's a special ops mission,
not a fucking safari.

25:16.097 --> 25:18.433
Sarge? We found
that radio.

25:18.599 --> 25:19.934
Shit, I don't believe it.

25:20.101 --> 25:21.936
There was only
supposed to be one!

25:22.103 --> 25:23.187
What's he on about, Sarge?

25:23.354 --> 25:25.773
Terry, get back on stag now.

25:25.940 --> 25:29.068
You've got to get me out of
here before they come back.

25:29.235 --> 25:31.446
Who, Captain?
Who is going to come back?

25:31.612 --> 25:35.908
They tore them to pieces
in front of my eyes.

25:36.075 --> 25:38.244
Sarge, if we don't get him
somewhere warm soon,

25:38.453 --> 25:39.954
he's gonna die of hypothermia.

25:40.121 --> 25:42.790
Stay with me, Captain.
Captain Ryan, stay with me.

25:42.999 --> 25:44.709
- Sarge.
- Not now, Spoon!

25:44.917 --> 25:46.002
I don't know if you care but
in about half an hour

25:46.210 --> 25:47.170
it's gonna be dark.

25:47.378 --> 25:49.297
Does anybody copy?

25:56.554 --> 25:57.638
Any ivy?

25:57.805 --> 25:59.474
The fuses are blown.

25:59.640 --> 26:01.350
Can you fix it?

26:01.517 --> 26:04.062
Maybe it was faulty or maybe
some damp got in the casing,

26:04.228 --> 26:06.397
but it's fried the circuits.

26:06.606 --> 26:09.776
Well, if it's
useless, mate, bin it.

26:10.777 --> 26:12.987
I also found this.

26:13.946 --> 26:16.449
It's attached inside.
Not part of the radio.

26:16.657 --> 26:18.034
Looks like a transmitter.

26:18.201 --> 26:20.036
Why would they put
a bug in our radio?

26:20.244 --> 26:21.871
It's the Kobayashi Maru test.

26:22.080 --> 26:23.956
They fixed it so
we can't fucking win.

26:24.165 --> 26:25.208
Ban it, Spoon.

26:25.416 --> 26:26.501
No, Terry,
it's probably some joke.

26:26.709 --> 26:28.711
He didn't want Joe to
hear the footy results.

26:28.920 --> 26:30.838
Love.
An early shot.

26:31.047 --> 26:32.381
You scavenge anything useful?

26:32.548 --> 26:36.010
Weapons, ammunition. A
couple of magnesium flares.

26:36.177 --> 26:37.804
That's about it.
The rest is fucked.

26:37.970 --> 26:40.473
All right, lads. Ditch
your I.T's. From here on in

26:40.640 --> 26:43.434
the exercise is well
and truly over.

26:43.601 --> 26:46.854
Anyone not carrying
live rounds better do so.

26:47.021 --> 26:48.022
Bruce.

26:48.189 --> 26:50.358
It won't make any difference.

26:50.525 --> 26:52.527
They won't die.

26:52.693 --> 26:54.821
This gives me a better
peace of mind, sir.

26:54.987 --> 26:56.030
You want peace of mind?

26:56.280 --> 26:57.323
Run for your lives before

26:57.532 --> 26:58.449
they tear your legs
from under you.

26:58.616 --> 27:02.662
Now you just shut up
like a good gentleman.

27:02.829 --> 27:05.039
You are scaring my lads.

27:06.582 --> 27:09.961
- What the fuck?
- Christ.

27:11.754 --> 27:13.881
Oh, shit.

27:14.048 --> 27:16.342
All right, lads,
grab what you can.

27:16.509 --> 27:19.220
Head to the tree line.
We're moving. Let's go.

27:33.651 --> 27:36.195
Right. I need a volunteer
for rear guard action.

27:36.362 --> 27:37.864
- I'll do it.
- Nice work.

27:38.030 --> 27:39.448
When we clear, you fall back.

27:39.657 --> 27:41.284
We're gonna be there
to cover you.

27:41.450 --> 27:45.204
Right, off you go.
Bruce, no heroics.

27:45.371 --> 27:46.914
Right.
Spoonie, you're on point.

27:47.123 --> 27:49.667
Joe, help Ryan.
Terry, you're up next.

27:49.834 --> 27:52.837
Coop, you and me. All right,
lads, every foot in the grass.

27:53.004 --> 27:55.256
Double time. Go!

27:55.423 --> 27:58.968
Come on, sunshine,
fucking shift it.

29:18.631 --> 29:20.591
Come on!

30:24.989 --> 30:27.283
Bruce. Bruce!

30:35.958 --> 30:37.668
Jesus!

30:41.714 --> 30:45.051
Cooper, get out of here!
Jesus, I'm bit, mate.

30:45.217 --> 30:48.637
You said no heroics, you
bloody hypocrite. Where's Bruce?

30:48.804 --> 30:51.265
He's all over there. They
fucking tore him apart.

30:52.433 --> 30:55.269
You piss off.
That is an order!

30:56.729 --> 30:57.980
Incoming!

30:59.482 --> 31:00.524
Fuck off.

31:00.733 --> 31:03.527
You can take your orders
and shovel them up your ass.

31:03.736 --> 31:05.946
Oh, Jesus, my guts are out.

31:06.113 --> 31:08.157
We'll just put them
back in again.

31:08.324 --> 31:10.785
They're not gonna fucking fit!

31:10.951 --> 31:12.536
Of course they'll fit, man.

31:12.703 --> 31:14.871
Here.

31:14.872 --> 31:16.832
Come on.
Come on.

31:16.999 --> 31:18.751
Come on.

31:18.918 --> 31:22.046
Come out of the fog.

31:26.050 --> 31:27.593
God.

31:31.013 --> 31:32.431
To your rear!

31:32.598 --> 31:34.058
A target!

31:38.479 --> 31:40.356
Target.

31:42.608 --> 31:44.693
Keep moving.

31:44.860 --> 31:46.195
Covering fire.

31:46.362 --> 31:48.406
Backing guard.

31:49.698 --> 31:51.450
They're circling us!

31:54.537 --> 31:55.704
Covering fire.

31:58.207 --> 32:00.251
Coming through!

32:02.294 --> 32:04.004
- Target.
- Fire!

32:08.134 --> 32:10.010
Reload!

32:15.558 --> 32:16.684
Bloody hell!

32:18.269 --> 32:20.688
Just fucking lie down!

32:26.777 --> 32:28.279
Lads.

32:29.697 --> 32:32.450
On me.
On me!

32:42.334 --> 32:45.212
Stop!

32:47.673 --> 32:48.757
Get in.

32:48.924 --> 32:50.509
Everybody on me!

32:50.676 --> 32:52.052
Hurry.

32:52.219 --> 32:54.263
Covering fire!

33:01.562 --> 33:03.731
Oh, shit!

33:10.070 --> 33:11.989
Just drive.

33:13.574 --> 33:15.784
. Now!
- I m

33:19.121 --> 33:21.290
They're fucking coming!

33:25.377 --> 33:26.837
Come on, stab it!

33:28.255 --> 33:29.840
Put it in reverse.

33:31.884 --> 33:34.261
Stab it!
Shiv it!

33:42.394 --> 33:43.521
Go forward.

33:49.735 --> 33:50.861
Fuck!

33:54.073 --> 33:57.618
Everything okay back there?
Any more casualties? Spoon?

33:57.785 --> 34:01.789
No, I'm all right. What
about Bruce? Where's Bruce?

34:01.956 --> 34:05.042
Bruce. Bruce is gone.
He's gone.

34:07.378 --> 34:09.213
Fuck it!

34:11.757 --> 34:14.385
Just hang on back there.

34:16.428 --> 34:17.763
Thank you.

34:17.929 --> 34:19.764
It's okay.
What happened?

34:19.974 --> 34:21.058
What happened?

34:21.266 --> 34:22.935
We were attacked by huge
fucking howling things.

34:23.143 --> 34:24.186
That's what.

34:24.395 --> 34:26.897
You were lucky I found you.
I was about to give up hope.

34:27.106 --> 34:28.983
And you were here?

34:29.149 --> 34:32.110
I heard gunfire last night.
I knew someone was out there.

34:32.277 --> 34:34.989
If you weren't already in
trouble, then you soon would be.

34:35.155 --> 34:39.659
We are. Two men are down.
Both need medical attention.

34:39.827 --> 34:41.370
We need to dress
the Sergeant's wounds

34:41.579 --> 34:42.954
before we can take him too far.

34:42.955 --> 34:45.498
There's only one
farm in this glen.

34:45.666 --> 34:48.418
The owners are friends.
We can take him in there.

35:15.487 --> 35:17.156
Hello?

35:25.164 --> 35:26.332
Nobody home?

35:26.498 --> 35:28.334
I don't know
where they could be.

35:30.502 --> 35:32.004
Alright.

35:32.171 --> 35:33.797
Stand back.

36:07.289 --> 36:11.835
Little pigs. Little pigs.
We've come to nick your video.

37:03.345 --> 37:05.639
Hey. Sit.

37:05.806 --> 37:08.726
Hey. Sit, sit.

37:11.353 --> 37:16.024
You stay. Hm?

37:21.363 --> 37:22.823
All clear.

37:39.631 --> 37:41.925
What the fuck happened
back there, Cooper?

37:42.092 --> 37:44.678
I don't know, mate.

37:44.845 --> 37:46.722
She might have some answers.

37:57.816 --> 37:59.610
All clear upstairs.

38:03.113 --> 38:04.740
Where the hell are we now?

38:04.907 --> 38:07.034
Home sweet home.

38:07.201 --> 38:09.703
Sit him down.

38:09.870 --> 38:11.830
Spoon, get a field
dressing on that wound.

38:11.997 --> 38:14.458
Terry, keep an eye out front.

38:27.596 --> 38:29.348
Is there a telephone here?

38:29.515 --> 38:30.432
What? No.

38:30.599 --> 38:31.975
It's still hot, lads.

38:32.142 --> 38:33.727
You can't just help yourself!

38:33.894 --> 38:37.731
I'm chinstrapped and I'm bloody
starving. I can help meself.

38:37.898 --> 38:39.274
It's the training, miss.

38:39.483 --> 38:41.944
Never waste an
opportunity to eat. Come on.

38:44.238 --> 38:46.615
Now look what I'm doing.

38:46.782 --> 38:48.617
Get it down your necks, lads.

39:00.170 --> 39:01.588
Hold it, hold it.

39:03.048 --> 39:04.424
Top grub.
What is it?

39:04.591 --> 39:06.593
Don't know, mate.
Looks like pork.

39:06.760 --> 39:09.471
Leave some for us,
you greedy mongrels.

39:09.638 --> 39:12.057
Miss, where is
the nearest phone?

39:12.224 --> 39:14.434
Fifty miles as the crow flies.

39:21.275 --> 39:23.735
What about the nearest
population center?

39:23.902 --> 39:26.446
You mean a town?
Well, Fort William,

39:26.613 --> 39:29.491
but it's at least a four-hour
drive back the way we just came.

39:29.658 --> 39:31.618
Do you think your
wounded can make it?

39:31.785 --> 39:33.787
We have to try, the Sarge is in
serious trouble if we don't.

39:33.954 --> 39:35.789
You seem to know these
roads. Will you take us?

39:35.956 --> 39:37.583
Right now?

39:37.791 --> 39:39.001
Unless your friends are
just gone for a walk about,

39:39.209 --> 39:40.669
this place may be compromised.

39:40.878 --> 39:43.046
Fine. The sooner
the better. Let's go.

39:45.424 --> 39:48.218
All right.
Spoon, on me.

39:48.385 --> 39:50.762
Everyone else hang back until
we bring the car about.

39:50.929 --> 39:54.683
Joe, help the Sarge.
Terry, watch him.

39:54.850 --> 39:57.102
Safeties off.

40:37.726 --> 40:40.604
Don't Shoot.

40:41.980 --> 40:45.192
Don't stare back.

40:45.359 --> 40:48.195
I can't help it.

40:49.071 --> 40:50.030
Go.

40:55.160 --> 40:57.537
Move on!

41:00.248 --> 41:02.960
That puts a kibosh on that plan.

41:03.126 --> 41:04.378
That was my car!

41:12.803 --> 41:14.846
- Sam, no!
- Get off!

41:15.931 --> 41:17.224
Oh, God.

41:18.684 --> 41:20.185
Piss off.

41:26.775 --> 41:28.819
Fuck that!

41:28.986 --> 41:30.570
Step back!

41:30.737 --> 41:32.072
Bloody hell!

41:36.660 --> 41:38.036
Get the dog off me.

41:38.245 --> 41:39.204
No.

41:39.371 --> 41:41.331
Pull the clog off me.

41:41.498 --> 41:43.125
God, Sam!

41:43.291 --> 41:45.085
Shut the dog up!

41:46.503 --> 41:48.046
Sam, come here.

41:49.798 --> 41:52.384
Terry, right flank.
Cover the window.

41:54.553 --> 41:55.887
Christ.

42:01.852 --> 42:04.396
That's bloody charming, that is.

42:08.900 --> 42:10.861
You incompetent moron!

42:11.028 --> 42:12.946
Do you wanna have
a fucking go like?

42:19.244 --> 42:20.829
Bathroom?

42:20.996 --> 42:23.915
Upstairs. Far
end of passage.

42:25.417 --> 42:26.752
We need to talk, Ryan.

42:26.918 --> 42:28.879
It doesn't look like
I'm going anywhere, does it?

42:29.046 --> 42:32.632
Joe, Spoon. Looks like we're
staying. You know what to do.

42:32.799 --> 42:35.302
I want a secure perimeter
with a clear field of fire.

42:35.469 --> 42:37.512
We'll give them something
inviting, right?

42:37.679 --> 42:39.556
- I'm on it.
- Right.

42:41.475 --> 42:43.393
Terry, are you okay?

42:43.560 --> 42:45.562
I've got a real craving
for a kebab.

42:45.729 --> 42:47.522
I'll take that as a yes.

42:47.689 --> 42:49.066
We've got limited ammunition.

42:49.274 --> 42:50.567
I want you to get as many
pots and pan

42:50.776 --> 42:51.902
as you can lay your hands on.

42:52.110 --> 42:54.780
Fill them with water and keep
them on the boil, all right?

42:57.407 --> 43:00.077
Terry, while you're at it
set the kettle on.

43:00.243 --> 43:01.536
We could all do with a brew.

43:09.336 --> 43:12.506
Terry, give us a hand with this.

43:16.259 --> 43:17.594
To the side, to the side.

43:17.761 --> 43:19.096
You fool.

43:19.262 --> 43:21.139
You came here because
of them, right?

43:21.306 --> 43:22.808
I don't have a fucking
clue what they are,

43:23.016 --> 43:24.434
and right now
I don't really care.

43:24.601 --> 43:26.436
What are you doing here?

43:26.645 --> 43:28.563
This was supposed to be
a routine training exercise,

43:28.772 --> 43:29.981
and that's all.

43:30.190 --> 43:31.233
So this wasn't a rescue mission?

43:31.441 --> 43:33.360
- What?
- No, I guess not.

43:35.779 --> 43:36.947
Back door is secure.

43:37.114 --> 43:38.782
What's happening here, Spoon?

43:38.990 --> 43:39.991
Well, they're still moving
around out there,

43:40.200 --> 43:41.201
but they're keeping
their distance,

43:41.409 --> 43:42.452
staying within the treelike.

43:42.661 --> 43:44.246
Maybe they've had
enough for one night.

43:44.454 --> 43:47.916
Not likely. They're smart.
You've seen what they can do.

43:48.083 --> 43:49.751
My guess is they're
doing exactly

43:49.960 --> 43:51.628
what you'd be
doing in their shoes.

43:51.795 --> 43:54.631
Working as a team. Looking
for a weakness. A way in.

43:54.798 --> 43:56.716
I'm not about to second-guess
these things.

43:56.925 --> 43:58.468
They're the enemy.
As simple as that.

43:58.635 --> 44:01.096
This is no ordinary enemy.

44:23.285 --> 44:26.913
You know what this reminds
me of? Rorke's Drift.

44:27.080 --> 44:28.623
A hundred men of Harlech

44:28.790 --> 44:32.294
making a desperate stand against
ten thousand Zulu warriors.

44:32.460 --> 44:35.046
Outnumbered, surrounded.

44:35.255 --> 44:38.508
Staring death in the face.
Not flinching for a moment.

44:39.467 --> 44:41.678
Balls of British steel.

44:41.845 --> 44:45.682
You're bloody
loving this, aren't you?

44:45.849 --> 44:47.601
It's totally bone.

44:47.767 --> 44:49.603
That's all there is to say.

45:00.447 --> 45:02.199
What are we talking
about here? Wolves?

45:02.365 --> 45:06.912
Not entirely wolf nor all human,
but something in between.

45:07.078 --> 45:10.290
Wolf men?
Having a laugh, right?

45:10.457 --> 45:12.334
I may be nuts
but I'm no fruitcake.

45:12.500 --> 45:15.545
Fine. Stay here
and drink tea.

45:16.588 --> 45:18.590
I thought you might be here
because of them but I guess not.

45:18.798 --> 45:21.426
Just don't be an asshole.

45:23.053 --> 45:25.639
I like your new
girlfriend, Coop.

45:26.848 --> 45:28.266
How're you feeling?

45:28.433 --> 45:31.561
A touch of gas.

45:31.728 --> 45:34.439
And the fact the various
body parts are trying

45:34.648 --> 45:35.941
to vacate the premises.

45:36.107 --> 45:38.318
Fucking awful.

45:42.364 --> 45:43.657
Ta.

45:44.741 --> 45:45.784
Cheers.

45:48.078 --> 45:49.287
Heads "P!

45:52.874 --> 45:54.960
For crying out loud, man.

45:55.126 --> 45:58.213
Short, controlled bursts.

46:01.758 --> 46:03.051
Do you have a name, soldier?

46:03.218 --> 46:04.719
Cooper.

46:05.929 --> 46:07.555
Gonna need your help here, miss.

46:07.722 --> 46:09.015
My name is Megan.

46:09.933 --> 46:11.184
And I know how to kill...

46:13.061 --> 46:15.063
Shit, Sarge, you're
leaking like a sieve.

46:15.272 --> 46:17.440
Look, I need you to get some
Superglue and some whiskey.

46:17.649 --> 46:19.276
- Alright?
- I'll see what I can do.

46:19.484 --> 46:21.194
- Come on.
- No, no, no.

46:21.361 --> 46:22.862
Sorry about the asshole thing.

46:23.071 --> 46:24.864
I've got a mean streak
a mile across.

46:25.031 --> 46:27.784
It's all right. It's the
least of my worries right now.

46:27.951 --> 46:30.578
Can you pass me my gun, please?

46:30.745 --> 46:32.539
Thank you.

46:33.748 --> 46:36.668
Come on, Coop.
Up the wooden hill.

46:36.835 --> 46:38.295
Where are we going, Coop?

46:38.461 --> 46:39.713
You don't want to know, mate.

46:39.921 --> 46:41.381
You don't want to know.

47:06.865 --> 47:08.700
What's the glue for?

47:08.867 --> 47:10.952
Ever wonder why
the best thing that

47:11.161 --> 47:13.163
Superglue sticks together
is your fingers?

47:13.371 --> 47:15.040
- Fuck, get off.
- Give it. Give it.

47:15.248 --> 47:17.584
Forget your grandma's
China cups.

47:17.751 --> 47:20.128
This stuff was developed
for the Vietnam war

47:20.337 --> 47:21.755
to patch up broken soldiers.

47:23.882 --> 47:25.592
How are you feeling, Sarge?

47:26.968 --> 47:29.804
Absolutely fucking top,
fucking bollocks.

47:29.971 --> 47:31.765
- Give us a...
- Give, give, give.

47:35.685 --> 47:36.644
Are you sure he should be

47:36.853 --> 47:38.063
chasing painkillers
with whiskey?

47:38.271 --> 47:39.939
He's earned it.

47:40.106 --> 47:41.608
Is it your birthday, Coop?

47:41.775 --> 47:42.692
No, mate.

47:42.859 --> 47:44.861
Is it my birthday? Hey!

47:45.028 --> 47:47.197
No. You're gonna thank us
for this in the morning.

47:47.364 --> 47:49.741
I'll tell you something.
I'm gonna fucking thank you.

47:49.908 --> 47:53.578
Right now I'm gonna thank you
because you saved my life.

47:53.787 --> 47:55.163
You got me out of there, mate.

47:55.330 --> 47:56.998
You would've clone the same.

47:57.165 --> 47:59.292
If I'd done the
same fucking thing,

47:59.501 --> 48:01.544
I would've saved Bruce,
wouldn't I?

48:01.711 --> 48:04.381
Oh, fuck!

48:14.140 --> 48:16.142
Fuck, stop!

48:20.021 --> 48:21.773
Jesus!

48:24.317 --> 48:25.985
Sausages.

48:27.404 --> 48:29.406
I'll tell you
something, miss, right?

48:29.572 --> 48:32.909
This guy here, right,
is my best mate.

48:33.076 --> 48:35.495
He's the salt of
the fucking Earth.

48:35.662 --> 48:36.538
Don't get me wrong.

48:36.746 --> 48:39.249
The rest of the guys in the
squad are lovely fellows.

48:39.416 --> 48:41.376
Anyone of them could marry my-

48:43.336 --> 48:47.257
marry my sister if I had one.

48:51.719 --> 48:54.681
I'll tell you what.
I love him. I love you.

48:54.848 --> 48:57.058
Like the mate
that I, that I love.

48:57.225 --> 48:59.018
Would you like to be alone?

49:04.524 --> 49:06.443
Dirty fucker!

49:07.610 --> 49:09.446
Here.

49:09.612 --> 49:10.864
It's the adrenaline.

49:11.030 --> 49:12.782
I'll stick and you bond.

49:12.949 --> 49:14.075
I'll tell you something.

49:14.284 --> 49:15.910
Something better get
fucking stuck real soon.

49:16.077 --> 49:18.204
'Cause this is really
starting to hurt.

49:18.371 --> 49:20.415
Cooper.

49:22.167 --> 49:24.335
Knock me out.
Hit me!

49:25.753 --> 49:28.006
You fucking
pussy. Hit me!

49:52.447 --> 49:54.198
So how long have you
lived around here?

49:54.199 --> 49:57.368
Two years. Came here
for the wildlife.

49:59.120 --> 50:00.330
I'm a zoologist.

50:00.497 --> 50:02.415
So you've heard those
stories as well then.

50:02.582 --> 50:05.919
Yeah. I heard the stories. I
went looking. I found evidence.

50:06.085 --> 50:07.921
I was fascinated
by the possibility-

50:08.087 --> 50:10.507
You can't seriously
believe in werewolves.

50:10.673 --> 50:11.716
Straight out of college,

50:11.925 --> 50:13.885
I'd have laughed at
the suggestion, but now

50:14.052 --> 50:16.804
I know they are
as real as you and me.

50:16.971 --> 50:19.390
Before tonight is over,
you will, too.

50:22.644 --> 50:24.229
There.

50:24.395 --> 50:26.564
I think that'll hold.

50:27.607 --> 50:29.192
You've done this before?

50:29.359 --> 50:32.695
Oh, yeah. We glue people's guts
together all the time out here.

50:41.621 --> 50:42.622
Everyone tooled up?

50:42.789 --> 50:44.916
To the nines.

50:48.795 --> 50:51.381
Poke your fucking eye
out with that one.

50:51.548 --> 50:54.384
Right, Terry, look sharp.

50:55.301 --> 50:57.220
The rest of you.

50:57.387 --> 50:59.389
I know things have gone
from shit to bone

50:59.597 --> 51:01.015
to worse in the last 24 hours.

51:01.182 --> 51:03.268
But if we pull our way
and do the job,

51:03.476 --> 51:05.186
we still have a fighting chance.

51:05.353 --> 51:09.691
No more running. We
stand here. We fight.

51:09.857 --> 51:12.694
Right?
Any questions?

51:12.860 --> 51:16.406
Just one, Coop. Exactly, what
is it we're fighting against?

51:16.573 --> 51:18.825
Megan, you wanna
run it pass the boys?

51:18.992 --> 51:20.952
- Lycanthropes.
- Yours?

51:21.119 --> 51:23.621
That's werewolves to you and me.

51:25.039 --> 51:26.374
Are you taking a piss?

51:26.583 --> 51:28.251
What? Makes perfect
sense to me.

51:28.459 --> 51:29.752
You mean like full moons,
silver bullets and

51:29.961 --> 51:31.337
eyebrows that
join in the middle?

51:31.504 --> 51:32.922
Before you dismiss it off hand,

51:33.131 --> 51:34.841
think about what
you've seen and heard.

51:35.008 --> 51:38.094
The full moon, the teeth,
the claws, the howling.

51:38.261 --> 51:41.014
Is it so difficult to believe?

51:41.180 --> 51:43.766
For a whole year now
I've tracked these things.

51:43.933 --> 51:46.477
I've studied them.
Try to understand them.

51:46.644 --> 51:50.607
Every month when the moon
is full, they hunt as a team

51:50.773 --> 51:52.692
dedicated to the kill.

51:52.859 --> 51:55.820
During that time at least
15 people have vanished.

51:55.987 --> 51:58.865
Hikers mostly,
in small groups or alone.

51:59.073 --> 52:01.659
They're caught out in the open,
hunted down,

52:01.868 --> 52:04.412
torn apart, and devoured.

52:04.621 --> 52:07.582
I've never witnessed the actual
slaughter, but the next day

52:07.749 --> 52:10.543
no bodies, no werewolves.

52:10.710 --> 52:12.670
Just blood.

52:12.837 --> 52:16.924
The eyebrows thing is nonsense.
It's just Dark Age paranoia.

52:17.091 --> 52:21.054
And silver bullets, no one's
ever got close enough to try.

52:21.220 --> 52:22.639
I'm sold.

52:22.805 --> 52:24.641
Slow down, Spoon.
Megan may have a point.

52:24.807 --> 52:26.559
I'm still not convinced
that these things

52:26.768 --> 52:28.269
didn't escape
from the local nuthouse

52:28.436 --> 52:30.229
and forget to shave
or trim their nails.

52:30.438 --> 52:32.190
But they're out there
and we're in here.

52:32.357 --> 52:34.233
What they may or
may not be does not

52:34.442 --> 52:36.444
affect our immediate
situation one bit.

52:36.611 --> 52:39.656
This is bone.
This is so fucking bone!

52:39.822 --> 52:41.157
Anything else?

52:41.324 --> 52:43.201
Yeah. What
does "bone" mean?

52:43.368 --> 52:44.452
Bone.
Bollocks and that.

52:44.619 --> 52:45.787
Not very good.

52:45.953 --> 52:48.539
Right. Anything else
I should know?

52:50.792 --> 52:52.794
Call signs.
You need to be specific.

52:52.960 --> 52:54.629
Upstairs you've
got Sergeant Wells,

52:54.837 --> 52:56.506
who you seem to know
inside and out.

52:56.673 --> 53:00.176
You got Spoon over there.
The vomiting cavalier, Terry.

53:00.343 --> 53:02.261
The big guy with the ax is Joe.

53:02.428 --> 53:05.264
Didn't you forget someone?

53:06.432 --> 53:08.142
Ryan.

53:08.309 --> 53:11.020
Captain Ryan is not
one of our team.

53:12.271 --> 53:15.983
His being here is hazy at best.

53:16.150 --> 53:18.569
If I could tell you, I would.

53:21.030 --> 53:23.825
But I'm just a soldier like you.

53:23.991 --> 53:27.453
No stripes.
No insignia.

53:27.620 --> 53:30.707
A suit and a uniform
does not make a soldier.

53:30.915 --> 53:32.333
He's with Special Ops.

53:32.500 --> 53:35.878
His team were wiped out last
night. He was the only survivor.

53:36.045 --> 53:38.214
I'd advise you against
pursuing this line

53:38.423 --> 53:39.966
of questioning, Private Cooper.

53:40.133 --> 53:42.135
You're pulling rank
on me now, Captain.

53:42.301 --> 53:44.220
You can shove that
right up your arse.

53:44.387 --> 53:48.307
I'm saying my being
here is a moot point

53:48.474 --> 53:51.185
since I'm now in as
much shit as you are.

53:51.352 --> 53:54.897
We're on the same fucking
shit. And we need each other.

53:55.064 --> 53:56.691
I doubt I need you.

53:56.858 --> 53:59.485
You bloody did two hours ago.

53:59.652 --> 54:00.820
The Uaths.

54:00.987 --> 54:02.196
Crying like a baby, you were.

54:02.363 --> 54:04.741
That was then.
Circumstances change.

54:04.907 --> 54:06.492
What?

54:06.659 --> 54:07.785
Uath It's Celtic.

54:07.994 --> 54:10.913
The family's lived in
this glen for centuries.

54:12.749 --> 54:14.500
So, what was he doing out there?

54:14.667 --> 54:16.711
I have an idea.

54:16.919 --> 54:19.380
I wanna hear it
from the horse's mouth.

54:20.339 --> 54:21.841
Come to think of it, Ryan,
how are you feeling?

54:22.008 --> 54:23.676
I'm fine.

54:23.843 --> 54:25.511
When we found you,
you could barely

54:25.720 --> 54:27.138
open your eyes, let alone walk.

54:27.305 --> 54:30.558
And then later you manage
to run. And now look at you.

54:30.725 --> 54:32.685
Fine and fit and sitting pretty.

54:32.852 --> 54:35.813
Hardly the behavior of a
man who until recently

54:36.022 --> 54:37.774
was knocking on death's door.

54:37.940 --> 54:39.859
I have a strong constitution.

54:40.026 --> 54:41.903
You're not bloody kidding.

54:42.069 --> 54:44.697
You won't mind if I have a
look at that wound of yours.

54:44.864 --> 54:46.783
I just assumed you didn't.

54:46.949 --> 54:48.910
I have a responsibility
to my patient.

54:49.076 --> 54:50.953
I'm warning you, Cooper,
don't touch me.

54:51.120 --> 54:53.164
Get back!

55:09.222 --> 55:11.682
Tie him up.
I want him to talk.

55:13.893 --> 55:16.187
What are you gonna do?
Torture him?

55:16.354 --> 55:17.355
I don't know.

55:17.522 --> 55:18.940
What would you do?

55:19.106 --> 55:20.525
I'd torture him.

55:24.904 --> 55:26.113
What now?

55:26.280 --> 55:27.615
They shut down the generator.

55:27.782 --> 55:29.033
Why would they do that?

55:29.200 --> 55:30.576
Because they can
see in the dark.

55:30.743 --> 55:32.161
And you're afraid of it.

55:32.328 --> 55:33.704
This is a pile of rancid shit!

55:33.871 --> 55:35.540
Now what do you believe?

55:35.706 --> 55:37.124
I'm beginning to believe you.

55:37.333 --> 55:39.126
I think Joe might've
worded it better.

55:39.293 --> 55:41.128
They're on the move.

55:41.295 --> 55:43.798
All right.
This is it.

55:43.965 --> 55:46.592
Mark your targets
and preserve your ammo.

55:46.759 --> 55:49.178
Three-round busts.

55:49.345 --> 55:51.222
We only got one
stun grenade apiece.

55:51.389 --> 55:54.642
So only use them
if absolutely necessary.

55:58.938 --> 56:00.273
Stand to.

56:03.276 --> 56:04.318
What can I do?

56:04.485 --> 56:05.528
What do you want to do?

56:05.695 --> 56:07.405
Run and hide.
I know what's coming.

56:07.572 --> 56:10.157
Take care of Sam.
Keep an eye on Ryan.

56:10.324 --> 56:12.493
If he tries anything, pan him.

56:12.660 --> 56:15.955
Chasing that first
kiss, are we, Cooper?

56:18.332 --> 56:20.543
It's as simple as this.

56:20.710 --> 56:24.839
You're not there for us,
we're not here for you.

57:19.560 --> 57:21.729
Contact!

57:25.691 --> 57:27.151
Die!

58:01.310 --> 58:03.020
Spoon, get down.

58:23.207 --> 58:24.542
Fuck!

58:31.048 --> 58:32.967
Fire in the hole!

58:35.177 --> 58:36.637
Ah!

59:35.654 --> 59:36.781
Cooper!

59:38.824 --> 59:40.951
Hurry!

59:52.213 --> 59:53.798
Cheers, mate.

59:59.178 --> 01:00:00.137
The Sarge.

01:00:07.686 --> 01:00:09.313
Cooper.

01:00:13.526 --> 01:00:16.153
Sarge?
Sarge!

01:00:29.416 --> 01:00:33.921
Sarge? Sarge, wake up.
Fucking wake up, you fuck.

01:00:35.881 --> 01:00:37.675
Sarge!

01:00:39.093 --> 01:00:41.303
You fucker.
Wake up.

01:00:45.641 --> 01:00:47.852
Fuck!
Sarge!

01:00:50.062 --> 01:00:52.273
Fuck off!

01:01:32.688 --> 01:01:34.440
Dogs.

01:01:34.607 --> 01:01:36.400
More like pussies.

01:01:58.964 --> 01:01:59.965
You all right?

01:02:00.132 --> 01:02:03.344
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I'm peachy, mate.

01:02:04.845 --> 01:02:06.513
Coop.

01:02:11.602 --> 01:02:14.104
The squad's yours, mate.

01:02:39.004 --> 01:02:40.256
They took Terry.

01:02:42.967 --> 01:02:44.718
Then we go and get him back.

01:02:44.885 --> 01:02:46.345
You're fucking right.

01:02:46.512 --> 01:02:48.639
Forget about him.

01:02:55.145 --> 01:02:57.231
What did you say?

01:02:57.398 --> 01:02:59.817
He's dead, Cooper,
and you know it.

01:03:01.026 --> 01:03:04.154
Shit.
Shit!

01:03:15.165 --> 01:03:17.418
Somebody must've heard
some gunfire.

01:03:17.584 --> 01:03:19.545
Somebody must've
heard something.

01:03:19.712 --> 01:03:22.214
Who? The only other house
within 50 miles of here

01:03:22.423 --> 01:03:23.716
is mine, and I'm not there.

01:03:23.882 --> 01:03:26.385
What about the road,
man, passers by?

01:03:26.552 --> 01:03:27.845
Do you have any
idea what kind of

01:03:28.053 --> 01:03:29.930
luck you had running into me
out there tonight?

01:03:30.139 --> 01:03:32.057
I thought you ran into us.

01:03:32.891 --> 01:03:35.019
Joe, check upstairs.

01:03:38.814 --> 01:03:40.566
Even if anyone did come by,

01:03:40.774 --> 01:03:42.693
they'd only end up lambs to
the slaughter like you.

01:03:44.111 --> 01:03:46.196
Our only hope is daylight.

01:03:46.363 --> 01:03:48.866
Sunrise is in six hours.

01:03:49.033 --> 01:03:51.243
We did the best we could.

01:03:51.410 --> 01:03:54.330
But if the Sarge's
condition deteriorates,

01:03:54.538 --> 01:03:56.332
he'll have less than four.

01:03:56.498 --> 01:03:58.208
And the only thing
holding them back

01:03:58.417 --> 01:04:00.919
is they don't know how
much ammunition we have left.

01:04:10.637 --> 01:04:12.389
Let's have a look at that.

01:04:13.807 --> 01:04:16.435
Tell me, honestly,

01:04:16.602 --> 01:04:18.312
what are our chances?

01:04:18.479 --> 01:04:21.815
The morale seems
good, considering.

01:04:21.982 --> 01:04:25.903
It'll only last as long
as the ammunition holds out.

01:04:26.070 --> 01:04:27.613
High spirits is
just no substitute

01:04:27.821 --> 01:04:28.822
for 800 rounds a minute,

01:04:28.989 --> 01:04:31.533
but I don't think that's
what you want to hear.

01:04:32.951 --> 01:04:34.995
Think about it, Cooper.

01:04:35.162 --> 01:04:37.706
Up until today you believed
there was a line

01:04:37.915 --> 01:04:39.333
between myth and reality.

01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:42.461
It may have been a very
fine line sometimes,

01:04:42.669 --> 01:04:44.421
but at least it was a line.

01:04:45.631 --> 01:04:47.716
Those things out there are real.

01:04:50.010 --> 01:04:52.429
If they're real,
what else is real?

01:04:54.139 --> 01:04:57.518
You know what lives
in the shadows now.

01:04:57.684 --> 01:04:59.686
You may never get
another night's sleep

01:04:59.895 --> 01:05:00.854
as long as you live.

01:05:01.021 --> 01:05:04.358
So why worry, Cooper? You
may not live that long.

01:05:04.525 --> 01:05:06.527
Shut your mouth.

01:05:08.195 --> 01:05:10.864
I'm gonna make it through
this. You know why?

01:05:11.031 --> 01:05:12.866
I don't scare that easy.

01:05:17.329 --> 01:05:18.956
Here.

01:05:20.207 --> 01:05:21.667
It's supposed to be lucky.

01:05:21.834 --> 01:05:23.794
For me or the rest
of the rabbit?

01:05:23.961 --> 01:05:26.004
You'll need a lot more
than luck this time.

01:05:26.171 --> 01:05:28.382
Shut up, RY?"-

01:05:28.549 --> 01:05:30.426
Listen to me, Cooper.
Ignore him.

01:05:30.592 --> 01:05:31.802
We can survive 'til sunrise.

01:05:32.010 --> 01:05:34.263
That's all that matters.
It's just a few more hours.

01:05:34.430 --> 01:05:37.141
Wait a minute. Am I
missing something here?

01:05:41.562 --> 01:05:44.314
I know him.

01:05:44.481 --> 01:05:47.776
I was seconded to his team
during their first visit here.

01:05:47.943 --> 01:05:49.403
First visit?
What first visit?

01:05:49.611 --> 01:05:51.321
What the fuck are
you talking about?

01:05:51.488 --> 01:05:54.491
They came to check out the
stories. They needed an expert.

01:05:54.700 --> 01:05:58.537
It's just a few more hours,
Cooper. That's all it is.

01:05:59.204 --> 01:06:00.706
All clear?

01:06:00.873 --> 01:06:02.040
Yeah.

01:06:02.207 --> 01:06:03.750
You wanna kill them all?

01:06:03.917 --> 01:06:05.043
Yes.

01:06:05.210 --> 01:06:06.712
Good.
Keep it up.

01:06:06.879 --> 01:06:09.089
What's the damage, Spoon?

01:06:09.256 --> 01:06:11.216
We might've pissed
all our chips.

01:06:11.383 --> 01:06:13.260
We've only got two full
mags for the MP5s,

01:06:13.427 --> 01:06:18.056
six rounds for the shotgun,
and one spare. Just in case.

01:06:19.224 --> 01:06:21.185
Stay sharp, everyone.

01:07:14.655 --> 01:07:16.740
We're putting fire
down all over.

01:07:16.907 --> 01:07:18.534
I mean, we filled
those things with lead,

01:07:18.742 --> 01:07:20.702
and they just kept getting up
and coming back at us.

01:07:20.869 --> 01:07:23.497
Sixty rounds won't
last us two minutes.

01:07:23.664 --> 01:07:26.166
So either we all make a break
for it and fight our way clear,

01:07:26.333 --> 01:07:28.085
or the rest of us keep
them occupied

01:07:28.293 --> 01:07:29.628
while one of us goes for help.

01:07:29.795 --> 01:07:31.797
By the time the
cavalry get here,

01:07:32.005 --> 01:07:33.257
they'll have to pick
what's left of us

01:07:33.465 --> 01:07:35.217
from between the fucking teeth.

01:07:46.812 --> 01:07:49.523
Fucking brilliant.

01:07:49.690 --> 01:07:53.110
We either stay and
snuff it, or we all go.

01:07:53.277 --> 01:07:54.570
And snuff it.

01:07:54.736 --> 01:07:57.281
Decisions, decisions.

01:07:57.447 --> 01:07:59.032
Laugh.

01:07:59.199 --> 01:08:00.701
I nearly died.

01:08:00.867 --> 01:08:01.952
Who's stopping you?

01:08:02.119 --> 01:08:03.954
That's it!
We'll fucking have him!

01:08:04.121 --> 01:08:06.957
Take it easy, big man.
Calm down.

01:08:07.165 --> 01:08:08.792
Do any of you know
how to hot-wire a car?

01:08:09.001 --> 01:08:10.002
What?

01:08:10.210 --> 01:08:11.795
They keep an old
Land Rover in the barn.

01:08:12.004 --> 01:08:13.005
I don't know where the keys are,

01:08:13.213 --> 01:08:15.549
but if one of you could
break in and start it, then...

01:08:15.757 --> 01:08:17.718
I can do that.

01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:19.761
Are you sure?

01:08:19.928 --> 01:08:21.680
A piece of piss.

01:08:21.846 --> 01:08:25.892
The further I am from this
wanker, the happier I'll be.

01:08:26.059 --> 01:08:29.520
All right. You're
gonna need a decoy.

01:08:29.688 --> 01:08:31.982
Something fast and loud.

01:08:38.863 --> 01:08:42.075
What?
You what?

01:08:47.331 --> 01:08:50.792
You, sit.
Stay.

01:08:59.718 --> 01:09:02.386
You're serious about this
werewolf thing, aren't you?

01:09:02.554 --> 01:09:04.389
Afraid so.

01:09:04.555 --> 01:09:06.015
Shit.

01:09:07.392 --> 01:09:09.435
Don't suppose you know
who won the match.

01:09:09.603 --> 01:09:11.354
Didn't even know
there was a game on.

01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:13.106
It's not a game.

01:09:13.273 --> 01:09:16.401
All right, this is it.
Everyone get ready.

01:09:16.568 --> 01:09:18.153
Bollocks.

01:09:25.535 --> 01:09:29.331
Joe.
Good luck, man.

01:09:29.497 --> 01:09:32.501
You don't get off
the hook that easy.

01:10:05.325 --> 01:10:08.203
All right, you bastards.

01:10:10.872 --> 01:10:15.752
Come on and have a go if you
think you're hot enough.

01:10:27.013 --> 01:10:29.891
Come on, you beauties!

01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:37.315
They took the bait.

01:10:42.821 --> 01:10:45.365
Come on!

01:10:45.532 --> 01:10:46.700
Spoon, run!

01:11:00.672 --> 01:11:03.300
Move your fucking arse, soldier.

01:11:04.342 --> 01:11:05.677
Come on.

01:11:05.844 --> 01:11:07.721
I'm trying.

01:11:17.564 --> 01:11:20.484
I love it when a
posh babe talks dirty.

01:11:25.697 --> 01:11:28.575
Jesus! Fucking what's
happening, Cooper?

01:11:35.749 --> 01:11:37.334
Cut it.
Cut it.

01:12:09.574 --> 01:12:11.618
Fuck this.

01:12:12.911 --> 01:12:13.954
Shit.

01:12:27.300 --> 01:12:30.178
He's done it. Ryan, up.
Everyone else downstairs.

01:12:30.387 --> 01:12:31.888
- Come on, move it.
- Alright, alright.

01:12:33.181 --> 01:12:34.724
Move. Move.

01:12:44.442 --> 01:12:46.611
You're behind me, aren't you?

01:12:52.033 --> 01:12:54.452
I'm gonna fucking have you!

01:13:06.965 --> 01:13:09.759
Right? Go. Go.

01:15:50.628 --> 01:15:51.671
Well?

01:15:51.838 --> 01:15:54.299
She's in a bad way.
Fuel pumps gone.

01:15:54.466 --> 01:15:55.300
Fan belt is bugging.

01:15:55.508 --> 01:15:57.635
She's pissing out petrol
like there's no tomorrow.

01:15:57.802 --> 01:15:59.929
The word "bone" springs to mind.

01:16:01.097 --> 01:16:02.974
Joe's body?

01:16:03.141 --> 01:16:05.101
It's gone.

01:16:09.647 --> 01:16:11.441
What's the damage, Spoon?

01:16:11.608 --> 01:16:13.943
We're down to 48 rounds.

01:16:14.110 --> 01:16:15.862
Check the right.

01:16:17.989 --> 01:16:20.617
Well, Ryan, you heard the score.

01:16:20.784 --> 01:16:23.495
Maybe one or two of us are
gonna make it through this.

01:16:23.661 --> 01:16:26.164
I don't care much
for our chances.

01:16:26.331 --> 01:16:27.832
Do you like football?

01:16:27.999 --> 01:16:33.213
What? They think it's all over
and all that crap? No, I don't.

01:16:33.379 --> 01:16:38.009
Don't you remember Joe? He liked
football. Fucking lived for it.

01:16:38.176 --> 01:16:39.969
Is this relevant?

01:16:40.136 --> 01:16:42.263
He missed the most
important match of his life

01:16:42.472 --> 01:16:43.598
for this bullshit exercise.

01:16:43.765 --> 01:16:45.850
And now he's dead along
with two other mates.

01:16:46.059 --> 01:16:47.310
I'd give gladly
given my right arm.

01:16:47.477 --> 01:16:49.813
Too fucking right it's relevant!

01:16:49.979 --> 01:16:52.315
You just can't get
past the dog, can you?

01:16:52.482 --> 01:16:55.193
We're losing, Ryan.
We're three now down,

01:16:55.401 --> 01:16:56.486
and we're close
to the final whistle.

01:16:56.694 --> 01:16:58.988
At the very least
I want to even the score.

01:17:02.033 --> 01:17:04.244
I understand your resentment.

01:17:05.078 --> 01:17:06.579
But you failed because

01:17:06.788 --> 01:17:09.833
you weren't prepared
to take that extra step.

01:17:10.041 --> 01:17:12.585
If you'd passed, you
would've been on my team.

01:17:12.752 --> 01:17:15.046
And if you were on
my team, you'd be dead.

01:17:15.213 --> 01:17:19.134
Yeah, I failed.
I'm bloody glad of it.

01:17:19.342 --> 01:17:20.593
If I was given the
choice of taking orders

01:17:20.802 --> 01:17:22.137
from a toffee nosed
twat like you

01:17:22.345 --> 01:17:24.013
and slogging it out
with these guys,

01:17:24.222 --> 01:17:25.598
I'll take the underdogs anytime.

01:17:25.765 --> 01:17:28.768
So you can take your precious
selection, shove it up your arse

01:17:28.977 --> 01:17:31.688
and stop trying to change
the fucking subject!

01:17:40.864 --> 01:17:42.949
Fair enough.

01:17:43.116 --> 01:17:45.618
But you won't like
what I have to tell you.

01:17:45.785 --> 01:17:48.913
There are some places
you really shouldn't go.

01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:51.749
We'll be the judge
of that, Ryan.

01:17:53.668 --> 01:17:56.546
Ever heard of Special
Weapons Division?

01:17:57.881 --> 01:18:00.008
They're the men in white coats
who train dolphins

01:18:00.216 --> 01:18:02.093
to stick mines on submarines.

01:18:02.302 --> 01:18:05.889
And cute furry animals to
tear your head off at the neck.

01:18:07.015 --> 01:18:09.726
They saw an opportunity
and called me in.

01:18:09.893 --> 01:18:12.228
To do what? Catch
one of these things?

01:18:12.395 --> 01:18:14.898
And to bring it back.
Alive if possible.

01:18:15.064 --> 01:18:17.650
Only "it" turned out
to be "them."

01:18:17.817 --> 01:18:19.944
We underestimated enemy numbers.

01:18:20.111 --> 01:18:21.946
Underestimated?
I would have a serious

01:18:22.155 --> 01:18:24.282
word with your heads about the
quality of their intelligence.

01:18:24.449 --> 01:18:26.993
It may have been their
invitation, but it was my party.

01:18:27.160 --> 01:18:28.953
I planned it and executed it.

01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:31.122
And you loused it up.

01:18:33.124 --> 01:18:35.210
We lost good men, Ryan.

01:18:35.376 --> 01:18:37.921
Yours and mine.

01:18:41.132 --> 01:18:42.425
I wanna know...

01:18:45.470 --> 01:18:47.138
where we fit in.

01:18:47.305 --> 01:18:50.725
The reality is
you're expendable.

01:18:50.892 --> 01:18:54.270
And I had approval
to put you at risk.

01:18:56.147 --> 01:18:59.692
Get to the fucking point, Ryan.

01:19:01.236 --> 01:19:03.947
I made a gap in enemy lines.

01:19:04.113 --> 01:19:06.241
You were good enough to spot it

01:19:06.449 --> 01:19:08.868
and predictable enough
to go for it.

01:19:09.035 --> 01:19:11.871
That was your bait.
You were mine.

01:19:17.168 --> 01:19:18.753
You bastard.

01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:22.423
I had to choose somebody.
I remembered you.

01:19:22.590 --> 01:19:24.968
Monkey see, monkey do.

01:19:27.136 --> 01:19:29.639
- They were my men!
- Get up, you shit.

01:19:29.847 --> 01:19:31.933
You know what we can do.
Give us a fighting chance.

01:19:32.100 --> 01:19:35.687
Live and learn, Cooper.

01:19:40.775 --> 01:19:42.735
I didn't hit him that hard.

01:19:43.611 --> 01:19:45.738
You tripped something lose.

01:20:20.481 --> 01:20:22.275
Bad dog.

01:20:27.322 --> 01:20:29.365
Fetch.

01:20:29.532 --> 01:20:30.867
Make the shot.

01:20:34.078 --> 01:20:35.705
Clear.

01:20:38.166 --> 01:20:41.377
Cooper, get clown.
I got target.

01:21:03.441 --> 01:21:07.153
Werewolves spend most of their
time in human form, right?

01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:11.074
And the only people from
miles around live right here.

01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:14.451
So these things aren't about to
give up the fight and go home.

01:21:14.452 --> 01:21:15.661
They are home.

01:21:15.828 --> 01:21:17.830
Yeah, well that makes
perfect sense, don't it?

01:21:17.997 --> 01:21:20.166
When you think about it,
we bust into their house.

01:21:20.375 --> 01:21:22.418
We eat all their porridge.
We sleep in their fucking beds.

01:21:22.585 --> 01:21:24.253
No wonder they're pissed off.

01:21:24.420 --> 01:21:26.464
But they're good people.
They're kind people.

01:21:26.631 --> 01:21:27.632
More's the pity.

01:21:27.799 --> 01:21:28.841
Why?

01:21:29.008 --> 01:21:30.385
'Cause we're gonna
have to kill them all.

01:21:30.551 --> 01:21:32.512
Too right, mate.

01:21:52.198 --> 01:21:54.200
What self-respecting
werewolf would have

01:21:54.409 --> 01:21:55.993
anything silver
in a house anyway?

01:21:56.202 --> 01:21:58.079
Fuck the folklore.
Let's just burn them.

01:21:58.287 --> 01:21:59.664
- Yeah.
- If we knew where to find them.

01:21:59.872 --> 01:22:01.416
Maybe we do.

01:22:01.582 --> 01:22:04.836
Everything we've seen so far
suggests the behavior of a pack.

01:22:05.002 --> 01:22:08.172
Six to eight members. An Alpha
pair leading the subordinates,

01:22:08.339 --> 01:22:11.843
and a young male, the Beta wolf,
second in command. Makes sense.

01:22:12.009 --> 01:22:13.719
You lost me.

01:22:13.886 --> 01:22:15.346
A wolf pack sticks together,

01:22:15.555 --> 01:22:17.890
generally somewhere
close to its food supply.

01:22:18.057 --> 01:22:22.770
Somewhere safe,
sheltered, and warm.

01:22:27.066 --> 01:22:30.111
You're gonna have to move like
shit off the shovel on this one.

01:22:30.278 --> 01:22:31.988
You wanna get your own shit.

01:22:32.196 --> 01:22:33.156
When we blow that fuse,

01:22:33.364 --> 01:22:35.116
that place is gonna go
up like Zabriskie Point.

01:22:35.324 --> 01:22:37.243
- Just make it work.
- Yeah, it's easy peesy.

01:22:37.410 --> 01:22:38.995
And lemon squeezy.

01:22:39.162 --> 01:22:40.830
Listen, Coop.

01:22:43.583 --> 01:22:45.501
What about the Sarge?

01:22:46.210 --> 01:22:48.004
What about the Sarge?

01:22:48.963 --> 01:22:50.965
You know what I mean.

01:22:55.136 --> 01:22:56.929
The Sarge is with us.

01:22:57.096 --> 01:22:58.556
Yeah, yeah.

01:22:58.723 --> 01:23:01.809
I just didn't want him to go
out and get his watch back.

01:23:10.818 --> 01:23:13.863
And you stay out of trouble.

01:23:28.377 --> 01:23:30.213
You all right?

01:23:32.340 --> 01:23:36.219
Oh, yeah, I am fine, Cooper.

01:23:36.385 --> 01:23:41.057
I mean, I feel
absolutely fantastic.

01:23:44.101 --> 01:23:46.145
That's a problem, isn't it?

01:23:46.312 --> 01:23:48.189
Hey.

01:23:52.026 --> 01:23:53.903
What if she's wrong?

01:23:55.613 --> 01:23:57.281
What if they're not
all in there?

01:23:58.658 --> 01:24:00.785
Then we'll get some of them.

01:24:00.952 --> 01:24:03.120
It's a shit lot better
than none of them,

01:24:03.287 --> 01:24:05.373
and a marked improvement
on all of us.

01:24:05.540 --> 01:24:08.876
No, you listen to me.
You get the fuck out now.

01:24:09.043 --> 01:24:11.671
I'll hold them back, I'll keep
them occupied. You get out.

01:24:13.297 --> 01:24:15.758
We've lost enough men for
one night, don't you think?

01:24:17.051 --> 01:24:19.053
Let me show you something.

01:24:22.557 --> 01:24:25.768
Do not tell me that
that is fucking normal.

01:24:29.480 --> 01:24:33.067
What happened to Ryan
is happening to me.

01:24:33.234 --> 01:24:35.486
It's just a matter
of time, mate.

01:24:35.653 --> 01:24:38.990
Stop wasting time
with this hara-kiri crap.

01:24:39.156 --> 01:24:41.117
This fight isn't lost, yet.

01:24:41.284 --> 01:24:45.913
With Ryan it only took a
couple of hours. It's full moon.

01:24:46.122 --> 01:24:48.249
Maybe it's like when you need
to take a piss or something.

01:24:48.457 --> 01:24:49.500
I don't know.

01:24:49.709 --> 01:24:51.335
When you gotta go,
you gotta fucking go.

01:24:51.544 --> 01:24:53.421
Maybe it's more like
needing a shite.

01:24:54.297 --> 01:24:56.132
Just 'cause you need one,
it doesn't mean you

01:24:56.340 --> 01:24:57.717
drop your kegs
and pinch one off.

01:25:01.053 --> 01:25:02.179
Anyway, fuck Ryan.

01:25:02.388 --> 01:25:05.016
Shifty bastard could've been one
of those things from the start.

01:25:05.224 --> 01:25:07.059
You know, Coop,
there's one more thing

01:25:07.268 --> 01:25:08.978
you gotta learn
about command, mate.

01:25:12.315 --> 01:25:16.152
Sometimes the people that
you kill are your own men.

01:25:18.487 --> 01:25:20.865
So, I'm asking you.

01:25:21.032 --> 01:25:23.075
Let me take care of myself.

01:25:25.536 --> 01:25:28.456
And at least spare you
the unfortunate business

01:25:28.664 --> 01:25:32.627
of trying to explain to Annie
why you had to incinerate me.

01:25:32.835 --> 01:25:34.920
We're gonna knock seven colors of
shit out of these fuckers.

01:25:35.129 --> 01:25:36.380
We need you.

01:25:36.964 --> 01:25:39.216
It's all right, you know, mate.

01:25:39.383 --> 01:25:41.010
It's okay.

01:25:42.470 --> 01:25:45.681
I just didn't make it
out this time. That's all.

01:25:47.016 --> 01:25:48.976
Because of the job,
you know what I mean?

01:25:49.185 --> 01:25:51.562
When I signed my life
away on that dotted line,

01:25:51.771 --> 01:25:53.356
I fucking meant it.

01:25:53.564 --> 01:25:57.026
I am a professional soldier.

01:26:04.617 --> 01:26:06.577
So, what do you want me to do?

01:26:10.331 --> 01:26:12.458
Roast their bollocks off.

01:26:14.752 --> 01:26:16.170
All clear.

01:26:18.381 --> 01:26:19.715
Good luck.

01:27:03.801 --> 01:27:05.428
Light it!

01:27:07.346 --> 01:27:08.723
Shit.

01:27:13.686 --> 01:27:15.396
Sarge.

01:28:11.660 --> 01:28:13.788
I'm sorry.

01:28:21.295 --> 01:28:23.172
When I found you
out there tonight,

01:28:23.339 --> 01:28:25.132
I truly believed you were the

01:28:25.341 --> 01:28:27.301
best chance
I had of getting out.

01:28:27.468 --> 01:28:29.887
But now we have no chance.

01:28:30.054 --> 01:28:32.556
There is no out.

01:28:32.723 --> 01:28:34.767
There never was.

01:28:36.727 --> 01:28:38.521
I came here to be
at one with nature.

01:28:38.729 --> 01:28:39.939
Well, I got what I wanted.

01:28:40.105 --> 01:28:42.817
Now I have to live with it.

01:28:46.278 --> 01:28:49.281
There is no house
in the next glen.

01:28:49.448 --> 01:28:51.242
No.

01:28:53.869 --> 01:28:56.413
And there were no werewolves
in the barn when it blew.

01:28:56.580 --> 01:28:58.707
Not one.

01:29:01.126 --> 01:29:02.962
And the reason you're
not in the photograph

01:29:03.170 --> 01:29:04.088
is 'cause you took it.

01:29:04.255 --> 01:29:05.589
I never meant to-

01:29:05.756 --> 01:29:08.467
You women.

01:29:08.634 --> 01:29:10.636
Same old shite.

01:29:10.803 --> 01:29:13.764
Being nice to women
will get you nowhere, Cooper.

01:29:13.931 --> 01:29:17.184
Being nice to me
will get you killed.

01:29:18.894 --> 01:29:21.355
You may think they're
all bitches, but...

01:29:22.898 --> 01:29:25.067
I'm the real thing.

01:29:34.785 --> 01:29:37.872
Do you think I like being
part of this fucked up family?

01:29:38.038 --> 01:29:40.791
Do you think I chose
to run with the pack?

01:29:40.958 --> 01:29:42.293
No.

01:29:42.459 --> 01:29:44.795
I chose you.

01:29:44.962 --> 01:29:48.382
But now you're out of
luck, and I'm out of time.

01:29:48.549 --> 01:29:53.637
And all we can do is let
nature take its course.

01:29:53.804 --> 01:29:57.641
They were always here.
I just unlocked the door.

01:29:57.808 --> 01:30:00.102
It's that time of the month.

01:30:17.244 --> 01:30:19.330
Somebody has to put it
out of his misery.

01:30:19.496 --> 01:30:21.415
Spoon.
Get clear.

01:30:21.582 --> 01:30:23.876
Go now!

01:30:24.084 --> 01:30:25.836
Spoonie, stop fucking
around and stick together!

01:30:26.045 --> 01:30:27.463
That's an order!

01:31:05.167 --> 01:31:06.460
Come on!

01:31:18.389 --> 01:31:19.640
Sarge?

01:31:27.982 --> 01:31:29.525
Sarge?

01:31:30.526 --> 01:31:32.778
I'm in the closet.

01:31:33.779 --> 01:31:35.906
Open the closet.

01:31:39.159 --> 01:31:41.245
Come on!

01:32:29.460 --> 01:32:32.212
You fucking mother!

01:32:48.020 --> 01:32:50.355
You're not killing me,
you bastard.

01:32:50.522 --> 01:32:53.442
How do you like the
tomatoes, you fucking bastard?

01:33:01.992 --> 01:33:04.620
Come on.

01:33:04.787 --> 01:33:07.915
I'm running out, Coop.
I'm running out.

01:33:17.716 --> 01:33:22.304
You're a bastard.
A right fucking bastard!

01:33:23.514 --> 01:33:25.641
Come on!
Come on!

01:33:46.203 --> 01:33:49.706
I hope I give you the
shits, you fucking wimp.

01:33:57.089 --> 01:33:58.924
You fucker.

01:33:59.091 --> 01:34:00.092
Come on, Coop.

01:34:05.097 --> 01:34:08.183
Beat it!

01:34:08.350 --> 01:34:09.685
Here.

01:34:11.728 --> 01:34:13.105
Go away.

01:34:26.118 --> 01:34:28.203
Go on, Coop!
Get stuck in mate!

01:34:28.412 --> 01:34:30.664
Get out of here!
Come on, you fucker!

01:34:30.831 --> 01:34:33.584
Go away, you fucking ass.

01:34:37.254 --> 01:34:39.006
Come on!

01:35:25.135 --> 01:35:27.971
Cooper, let's get
in the wardrobe, son.

01:35:28.138 --> 01:35:29.306
What?

01:35:29.473 --> 01:35:30.807
Let's get in the wardrobe.

01:35:30.974 --> 01:35:32.267
All right.

01:35:37.397 --> 01:35:39.233
What's that smell?

01:35:39.399 --> 01:35:41.235
I don't know.

01:35:45.864 --> 01:35:48.116
Fucking hell.

01:35:50.535 --> 01:35:52.120
Give me the gun.

01:35:54.957 --> 01:35:58.961
Open your mouth. Watch
your ears. Mind your toes.

01:36:04.216 --> 01:36:05.801
Go.
Run!

01:36:19.773 --> 01:36:21.942
Where's Spoon?

01:36:25.737 --> 01:36:28.323
There is no Spoon.

01:36:28.490 --> 01:36:30.491
No, you fucking bastards!

01:36:30.492 --> 01:36:32.452
Help me, Cooper.

01:36:51.722 --> 01:36:53.682
Get in there.
Get in there!

01:36:57.561 --> 01:36:59.146
What are you doing?

01:36:59.354 --> 01:37:01.565
Take this. There's one in
the chamber, mate.

01:37:01.773 --> 01:37:03.775
- I'm fucking bit.
- No, you're not.

01:37:03.984 --> 01:37:06.028
We go together or
we don't fucking go.

01:37:06.194 --> 01:37:09.865
It's my last order. Do not
fuck about. Do not disobey me.

01:37:10.032 --> 01:37:11.950
Fuck! Listen.

01:37:12.117 --> 01:37:14.119
You have got
to make it out alive.

01:37:14.286 --> 01:37:18.915
Prove what happened.
Not just for me or my lads.

01:37:21.001 --> 01:37:22.627
For her!

01:37:24.838 --> 01:37:26.715
Here.

01:37:28.091 --> 01:37:30.135
Prove it happened, mate.

01:37:30.302 --> 01:37:32.429
Go! Go!

01:40:00.494 --> 01:40:02.954
Sam. Fuck.

01:40:06.583 --> 01:40:08.210
Fuck!

01:40:19.971 --> 01:40:23.225
Ryan, have you tried
licking your own balls, yet?

01:40:27.145 --> 01:40:29.564
I forgot. You don't
fucking have any.

01:40:39.616 --> 01:40:40.700
'An

01:41:25.662 --> 01:41:28.373
You think it's all over?
It is now.
