00:21.919 --> 00:23.673
He's not coming back.

00:24.085 --> 00:25.506
Time of death...

00:25.934 --> 00:27.440
8:21.

00:32.345 --> 00:34.513
I'll go fill out the death certificate.

00:40.487 --> 00:41.688
That hurt?

00:41.690 --> 00:43.289
Doesn't tickle.

00:46.026 --> 00:47.993
Thank you.

00:54.167 --> 00:56.202
How do you maneuver those R.V.s, anyway?

00:56.204 --> 00:57.236
They're so huge.

00:57.238 --> 00:59.438
She's a beast. That's what we call her.

00:59.440 --> 01:01.540
Okay, follow my pen.

01:01.542 --> 01:03.775
The only downside
is you can't stop on a dime

01:03.777 --> 01:06.966
when some texting dumbass
decides to park on the off ramp.

01:07.016 --> 01:09.108
And then you hit the side
of your head on the window.

01:09.158 --> 01:10.177
Mm-hmm.

01:10.227 --> 01:11.043
Ouch.

01:11.093 --> 01:13.952
Okay, just look over your shoulder for me.

01:15.380 --> 01:16.848
Good, and the other side.

01:16.898 --> 01:17.772
I got to call the mechanic.

01:17.822 --> 01:18.790
How's Mike doing?

01:18.840 --> 01:19.621
We don't get moving soon,

01:19.671 --> 01:20.625
they're gonna give away our yurt.

01:20.627 --> 01:23.394
Your husband's being seen right now.

01:24.493 --> 01:26.797
I didn't realize yurts
were so... sought after.

01:26.799 --> 01:28.666
Oh, man, you want to get a good campsite,

01:28.668 --> 01:31.035
you got to get online
eight months in advance.

01:31.037 --> 01:32.537
Mm. Everybody yurts, I guess.

01:33.540 --> 01:35.440
Sorry.

01:35.442 --> 01:36.407
Am I done?

01:36.409 --> 01:37.608
Yes.

01:37.610 --> 01:38.876
There are killer blueberry muffins upstairs.

01:38.878 --> 01:40.945
If you want to get a bite and take a walk,

01:40.947 --> 01:42.379
I can come find you later.

01:42.381 --> 01:43.480
- Okay. Will do.
- Okay.

01:44.983 --> 01:46.150
What's the prognosis, doc?

01:46.152 --> 01:47.618
Can I get this one back on the road?

01:47.620 --> 01:48.619
You betcha.

01:48.621 --> 01:49.820
Just a couple more minutes.

01:49.822 --> 01:50.888
Besides, it's rush hour.

01:50.890 --> 01:52.422
I'm doing you guys a favor right now.

01:52.424 --> 01:53.690
I'm gonna grab a bite, Mike.

01:53.692 --> 01:54.458
You want a muffin?

01:54.460 --> 01:55.626
I'm good.

01:55.628 --> 01:56.926
No, you're not. You missed breakfast.

01:56.928 --> 01:58.228
Okay, then.

01:59.397 --> 02:01.898
Happy wife, happy life.

02:01.900 --> 02:03.267
You got it, man. You married?

02:03.269 --> 02:05.469
Divorced, but happily attached.

02:05.471 --> 02:07.504
- Oh, so you got a do-over.
- Yeah, that's right.

02:07.506 --> 02:08.687
I'm gonna get you to apply some pressure

02:08.737 --> 02:09.905
when I pull this out.

02:09.907 --> 02:12.042
On three. One, two, three.

02:16.648 --> 02:17.914
That doesn't sound good.

02:20.151 --> 02:21.151
Breathe.

02:21.153 --> 02:22.152
I'm fine.

02:22.154 --> 02:23.820
Sure. Just breathe.

02:26.691 --> 02:28.724
Again, not really loving
what I'm hearing, there.

02:28.726 --> 02:30.426
Are, uh... you been sick recently?

02:30.428 --> 02:31.360
Off and on.

02:31.362 --> 02:33.262
Well, I think it's best

02:33.264 --> 02:35.130
to just go up for a quick chest scan.

02:35.132 --> 02:37.766
Nah, don't-don't worry
about it, Dr. Miller.

02:37.768 --> 02:38.967
I know you're in a hurry,

02:38.969 --> 02:40.836
but it's best to just go up and take a look.

02:41.906 --> 02:44.372
I don't want you wasting your time, here.

02:44.374 --> 02:46.374
I'm dying.

02:46.376 --> 02:48.811
Please don't tell my wife.

03:00.214 --> 03:01.373
Crazy morning.

03:01.423 --> 03:02.176
Tell me about it.

03:02.226 --> 03:04.826
Pronouncing someone dead...
not the ideal start to the day.

03:04.828 --> 03:07.028
Well, here's hoping things settle down.

03:07.897 --> 03:09.030
Eventually.

03:09.032 --> 03:13.935
Hello, sir. I'm Dr. Reid. What's your name?

03:13.937 --> 03:15.870
Travis.

03:15.872 --> 03:17.839
Okay, Travis, what happened?

03:17.841 --> 03:19.607
It's my leg. It's my leg.

03:19.609 --> 03:22.009
Okay, we're gonna move you
over on three, guys.

03:22.011 --> 03:25.012
Ready? One, two, and three.

03:26.349 --> 03:28.482
Okay, looks like
you hurt your leg pretty bad.

03:28.484 --> 03:30.484
100 mikes of Fentanyl.

03:30.486 --> 03:31.853
Don't call the cops.

03:31.855 --> 03:33.153
Why would we call the cops, Travis?

03:33.155 --> 03:34.087
Oh!

03:34.089 --> 03:35.956
Secure alert. Fancy shmancy.

03:35.958 --> 03:37.991
Yeah, it's court-ordered bling.

03:40.363 --> 03:42.129
Okay, looks like you dislocated your knee.

03:42.131 --> 03:43.797
We're gonna have to get you into surgery.

03:43.799 --> 03:46.333
No, I don't want surgery, please.

03:46.335 --> 03:47.768
No, what you don't want
is to be walking around

03:47.770 --> 03:49.102
on a gimpy leg the rest of your life.

03:49.104 --> 03:50.670
Travis, we're not
gonna be calling the cops.

03:50.672 --> 03:52.105
We just want to know what's
going on with you, all right?

03:52.107 --> 03:54.841
I got mugged crossing the Wallace Bridge.

03:54.843 --> 03:56.376
They took all my money.

03:56.378 --> 03:59.880
I had to jump off the bridge
on its tracks to get away.

03:59.882 --> 04:02.515
It's my leg. It's just... it's my leg.

04:02.517 --> 04:03.616
Fast looks clear.

04:03.618 --> 04:04.851
Pulse is pretty faint.

04:04.853 --> 04:06.819
We'll see how it is once the leg is reduced.

04:06.821 --> 04:08.220
I'll order a C.T. angiogram,

04:08.222 --> 04:09.922
see if there's any vascular damage.

04:09.924 --> 04:12.558
It was all the money I had
to give to Kim before I go away.

04:12.560 --> 04:14.860
Where are you going, Travis?

04:14.862 --> 04:18.398
Jail. I'm going to jail.

04:22.281 --> 04:25.002
So after we got the muscle
and the ligament out of the way,

04:25.004 --> 04:26.870
uh, we were able to expose the nerve root

04:26.872 --> 04:29.339
and remove the bone that was
placing the pressure on it.

04:29.341 --> 04:33.009
Am I hearing you say that I might... walk?

04:33.011 --> 04:35.311
- There are many factors to consider...
- But I might?

04:35.313 --> 04:37.881
Uh, look, I want this
as much as you do, believe me.

04:37.883 --> 04:39.415
These surgeries can help

04:39.417 --> 04:42.084
some patients regain even limited mobility.

04:42.086 --> 04:43.553
It'll be a huge victory.

04:44.758 --> 04:47.156
Speaking of which,
guess who's getting married.

04:47.158 --> 04:49.091
Yes, I couldn't help but notice the ring.

04:49.093 --> 04:49.925
Oh, this old thing?

04:49.927 --> 04:51.660
Nice.

04:51.662 --> 04:53.996
It's perfect... just like
the man who gave it to me.

04:53.998 --> 04:55.697
You're invited, of course.

04:55.699 --> 04:57.066
Thank you.

04:57.068 --> 04:58.934
You can watch me walk down the aisle.

04:58.936 --> 05:00.969
Ah, ah, hey, watch...

05:00.971 --> 05:04.740
Okay, maybe not walk walk,
but take some steps.

05:04.742 --> 05:06.174
Okay, and presumably, your father's
gonna be helping you

05:06.176 --> 05:07.910
- to walk down the aisle...
- No, no help.

05:07.912 --> 05:09.545
On my own.

05:09.547 --> 05:10.646
With a walker.

05:10.648 --> 05:12.748
Eye of the tiger. I like it.

05:12.750 --> 05:14.850
Be reasonable with your expectations, here.

05:14.852 --> 05:16.018
I will be.

05:16.020 --> 05:19.021
I expect to blow their minds.

05:22.458 --> 05:23.341
Won't work for everyone.

05:23.391 --> 05:24.411
I hope you made that clear, Joel.

05:24.463 --> 05:26.665
I would never give anyone
false hope, Shahir.

05:26.715 --> 05:27.715
Sounds like a valid study.

05:27.765 --> 05:29.723
I'll be happy to consult.

05:29.773 --> 05:31.448
Awesome.

05:32.435 --> 05:34.133
You know, I'm looking at
some exoskeleton technology...

05:34.183 --> 05:36.176
- might get my hands on a prototype.
- Let's not

05:36.303 --> 05:37.834
get ahead of ourselves.

05:39.024 --> 05:40.740
By the way, I'm putting together
a contact list

05:40.742 --> 05:42.309
for when Alex goes into labor.

05:42.311 --> 05:44.378
Okay.

05:44.380 --> 05:46.480
Okay, so do you want to be on that list?

05:46.482 --> 05:49.554
Whatever Alex wants,
that's, um... I don't know.

05:49.619 --> 05:50.339
What can I get you?

05:50.394 --> 05:51.830
Could I just, uh,
have a second, please, mate?

05:51.880 --> 05:53.880
- Um...
- That's not a hard question, Joel.

05:54.190 --> 05:55.865
Yeah, I, um...

05:56.186 --> 05:58.324
could I have just have a large,
black coffee, please, mate?

05:58.326 --> 05:58.994
And for you?

05:59.044 --> 06:00.350
- Um, the usual.
- Yeah.

06:00.788 --> 06:02.513
So, how many of these
second-decompression surgeries

06:02.563 --> 06:03.132
have you done so far?

06:03.182 --> 06:04.734
- Uh, one.
- One.

06:04.784 --> 06:06.317
And do you think the patient
will see progress?

06:06.367 --> 06:08.401
Well, if anyone will, it's her, yeah.

06:08.403 --> 06:09.402
Thank you.

06:09.404 --> 06:10.971
Hey, Paulette.

06:12.553 --> 06:14.640
Imaging looks good. How's the head?

06:14.642 --> 06:16.142
Totally fine.

06:16.144 --> 06:18.344
But can I get a little something anyway?

06:18.346 --> 06:19.247
Mike's had these headaches,

06:19.297 --> 06:21.410
- and the ibuprofen isn't cutting it.
- Sure.

06:21.952 --> 06:23.316
He's coughing too.

06:23.318 --> 06:25.951
It's just some bug, but it's
a long way to Churchill.

06:25.953 --> 06:27.153
- Better safe than sorry.
- Yeah.

06:27.155 --> 06:28.600
Oh! That's the mechanic.

06:28.650 --> 06:30.179
- A lot going around.
- Yeah.

06:30.461 --> 06:32.925
Yeah, hi. So, what's the damage?

06:32.927 --> 06:34.460
Did you swab Mr. Gillis?

06:34.462 --> 06:36.596
His wife wants some preemptive meds,

06:36.598 --> 06:39.098
and I want to rule out
a bacterial infection.

06:39.100 --> 06:42.201
Okay, could have sworn we had
cold'n'flu samples in here.

06:42.203 --> 06:43.669
He doesn't need those.

06:44.069 --> 06:45.417
Yeah, but she might.

06:45.467 --> 06:48.394
He could be contagious,
and everybody likes a freebie.

06:48.444 --> 06:51.813
She's not gonna catch it,
and that's not gonna help him.

06:51.888 --> 06:52.811
Why not?

06:52.813 --> 06:55.614
Because he doesn't have a bug, Maggie.

06:55.616 --> 06:58.050
He's got stage-four lung cancer.

07:00.419 --> 07:01.586
You're kidding.

07:01.588 --> 07:02.720
I'm not.

07:02.722 --> 07:05.323
Then why does she think this is gonna help?

07:05.325 --> 07:06.991
'Cause she doesn't know.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.520
- How'd it go?
- Uh, it didn't.

07:17.570 --> 07:19.569
Legs couldn't even support my weight.

07:19.571 --> 07:21.638
Well, don't you be discouraged
about that, okay?

07:21.708 --> 07:23.186
You're just getting started, here.

07:23.442 --> 07:25.409
It's not the start I was hoping for.

07:25.411 --> 07:27.323
It's not miracle surgery.

07:27.602 --> 07:30.047
It's just a small step towards
regaining some of that movement.

07:30.049 --> 07:30.890
Best-case scenario,

07:30.960 --> 07:32.980
you're still gonna need
that chair most of the time.

07:33.218 --> 07:34.424
It's fine.

07:34.609 --> 07:38.398
I believe if anyone can do it,
it's you, okay?

07:38.517 --> 07:39.547
Maybe not in time for the wedding,

07:39.613 --> 07:42.642
but I still really believe that
you're gonna take some steps.

07:42.828 --> 07:43.943
Yeah.

07:44.429 --> 07:45.721
What is it?

07:46.985 --> 07:50.233
You know, the white dress, the music,

07:50.235 --> 07:54.637
the walk down the aisle, everyone watching.

07:55.523 --> 07:58.007
It's silly, but what can I say?

07:58.009 --> 07:59.484
It was my dream.

07:59.541 --> 08:00.880
Dreams are important. Look,

08:00.958 --> 08:03.597
you just need to have
patience here, okay?

08:03.773 --> 08:05.674
Promise me you're not gonna get disheartened

08:05.760 --> 08:08.050
- if everything doesn't happen instantly.
- Okay.

08:08.465 --> 08:10.353
- Uh, my arms are fine, Dr. Goran.
- Okay.

08:10.355 --> 08:12.188
- I can wheel myself.
- You got it.

08:21.670 --> 08:23.706
Your X-ray confirms it, Mike.

08:24.277 --> 08:25.434
You have lung cancer.

08:25.525 --> 08:26.908
What, you thought I made it up?

08:26.994 --> 08:27.803
Dark.

08:28.373 --> 08:29.970
Your wife's worried about your cough.

08:30.060 --> 08:32.178
Yeah, she's worried about a lot of things.

08:32.227 --> 08:33.943
There's nothing she can do to stop this one,

08:33.945 --> 08:35.577
so why add it to the pile?

08:35.578 --> 08:37.113
You're going traveling.

08:37.115 --> 08:38.981
What if you get sick?

08:38.982 --> 08:41.783
Listen, I've thought about all that.

08:42.246 --> 08:43.782
I really have.

08:43.832 --> 08:46.388
I mean, whatever's coming down
the pipe for me

08:46.390 --> 08:47.856
is gonna be brutal.

08:48.466 --> 08:49.599
I know that.

08:49.681 --> 08:51.426
It's gonna be brutal for your wife, too,

08:51.428 --> 08:53.595
which is why you need to tell her.

08:53.597 --> 08:56.265
It's my business what I tell her.

08:56.267 --> 08:58.733
Don't get any ideas
about making that call for me.

08:58.735 --> 09:00.735
Nobody's talking about doing that.

09:01.347 --> 09:02.737
I love her.

09:03.383 --> 09:05.774
I love her so much.

09:05.776 --> 09:08.843
But she hates not being
in control of a situation.

09:08.845 --> 09:12.513
I mean, the less time she has
to wring her hands, the better.

09:12.515 --> 09:15.483
There are options, Mike,
for people with cancer.

09:18.321 --> 09:21.455
I want to go out listening to her laugh,

09:22.548 --> 09:26.594
not trapped in some hospital,
being poked and prodded.

09:26.596 --> 09:28.862
But even just to manage your pain?

09:28.864 --> 09:32.365
Time is so precious.

09:32.367 --> 09:35.903
I always wanted to see the northern lights,

09:35.905 --> 09:38.738
and I'm on my way there right now

09:38.740 --> 09:41.041
with the love of my life.

09:43.544 --> 09:48.381
Unless you have something
more magical than that.

09:51.018 --> 09:55.254
I didn't think so.

09:58.459 --> 10:01.093
He made me a spreadsheet.

10:01.095 --> 10:03.129
Shahir doing a birth plan.

10:03.131 --> 10:05.932
I'm picturing a flow chart
and statistical analysis.

10:05.934 --> 10:07.599
Well, he is thorough.

10:08.636 --> 10:10.236
Here, have a look at this bruise.

10:12.072 --> 10:14.207
Wow. He was definitely hit with something.

10:14.209 --> 10:18.010
Yeah, with a pipe or a baseball bat.

10:18.012 --> 10:20.212
Didn't mention that in the E.R.

10:20.214 --> 10:21.580
Yeah, the fast was clear,

10:21.582 --> 10:23.716
but now I'm starting to wonder
about the bruises on his chest.

10:23.718 --> 10:25.851
Yeah, it must have been a hell of a mugging.

10:25.853 --> 10:27.152
Let's order a chest C.T.

10:27.154 --> 10:30.121
He may be lying,
but the imaging... not so much.

10:30.123 --> 10:32.023
That is very good, Dr. Reid.

10:34.227 --> 10:35.527
Thanks.

10:42.701 --> 10:44.102
You okay?

10:44.104 --> 10:45.937
Uh, yeah. Yeah. I'm-I'm done.

10:45.939 --> 10:47.939
Um, you ready to do that artery?

10:47.941 --> 10:50.008
Yeah. I'm on it.

10:50.010 --> 10:51.709
Okay.

10:51.711 --> 10:53.878
20 blade and an Adson.

10:56.382 --> 10:58.683
And I need the table up.

11:05.824 --> 11:06.957
What are you looking at?

11:06.959 --> 11:08.058
It's her.

11:11.263 --> 11:13.130
Okay, I'll ask the question again.

11:13.132 --> 11:14.131
What do you want?

11:14.133 --> 11:15.832
I'll never let you go.

11:15.834 --> 11:18.068
I know her from somewhere.

11:18.070 --> 11:20.570
Yes. She pronounced you dead.

11:20.572 --> 11:25.876
No, from before. But I can't remember.

11:25.878 --> 11:28.712
- Uh, I think you're mistaken.
- No, I'm not.

11:28.714 --> 11:31.815
I'll never let you go.

11:31.817 --> 11:33.750
I'll never let you go.

11:33.752 --> 11:37.053
Okay, you can stop saying that.

11:37.055 --> 11:40.189
I'll never let you go.

11:42.426 --> 11:45.261
I'll never let you go.

11:45.263 --> 11:46.396
All set?

11:46.398 --> 11:48.131
- Ready to get back on the road?
- Yeah.

11:48.133 --> 11:49.132
All right.

11:53.304 --> 11:56.239
How do you even keep a secret like that?

11:56.241 --> 11:58.007
I think it's great, what they're doing...

11:58.009 --> 11:59.475
traveling cross-country together,

11:59.477 --> 12:01.877
- romance of the road.
- Yeah.

12:01.879 --> 12:03.679
Yurts.

12:05.817 --> 12:07.650
Mike? Mike, what is it?

12:09.019 --> 12:11.153
What's happening? Mike?

12:11.155 --> 12:12.354
Zach.

12:13.957 --> 12:15.290
Help!

12:15.292 --> 12:16.758
Jackson, oxygen.

12:18.928 --> 12:20.176
It's okay. Okay, step back.

12:20.226 --> 12:21.039
I got him. I got him.

12:21.089 --> 12:22.340
Oh, my god,
is he having a heart attack?

12:22.390 --> 12:22.964
Okay.

12:22.967 --> 12:24.532
- Mike, what is...
- Jackson, let's go! Come on!

12:27.503 --> 12:29.271
What's happening?

12:29.273 --> 12:30.805
What's wrong with him?

12:42.028 --> 12:43.508
Hey, Travis. How you doing?

12:44.431 --> 12:47.799
I'm not loving these tent-pole things.

12:47.801 --> 12:50.995
Uh, yeah, those were just to,
um, stabilize the leg

12:51.045 --> 12:53.700
so that Dr. Reid could,
uh, repair some vascular damage.

12:53.914 --> 12:55.001
I'm gonna have to do another surgery

12:55.051 --> 12:56.374
to put in the permanent hardware.

12:56.376 --> 12:59.310
Okay, so, when are you gonna do that?

12:59.312 --> 13:03.414
Because I got to go...
I got to go to jail in two days.

13:04.450 --> 13:06.584
Travis, you're not going anywhere.

13:06.586 --> 13:08.452
Yeah, I am.

13:08.454 --> 13:12.890
If I'm not home at 6:00,
the monitor goes off,

13:12.892 --> 13:17.428
and then I just got cops
showing up at my door.

13:18.565 --> 13:19.630
It's not just the cops

13:19.632 --> 13:21.198
you're worried about, though, is it?

13:21.200 --> 13:23.901
What, so, I-I-I screwed some guys over,

13:23.903 --> 13:29.272
and then they came after me,
and that's that.

13:29.274 --> 13:30.941
Okay, well, just so you know,

13:30.943 --> 13:33.777
unless it's a gunshot wound,
I don't have to report it.

13:33.779 --> 13:35.245
Well, I'm not a criminal,

13:35.247 --> 13:37.280
so you don't need to report anything.

13:37.282 --> 13:39.716
You know all you need to know,

13:39.718 --> 13:43.052
so what are we even talking about right now?

13:45.956 --> 13:46.956
Okay.

14:01.805 --> 14:04.006
If I were her, I'd want to know.

14:04.008 --> 14:07.777
Yeah?

14:07.779 --> 14:12.114
Well, you're not her, and you're not me.

14:12.116 --> 14:13.782
It's my choice to make.

14:15.585 --> 14:17.386
It's incredibly selfish, what you're doing.

14:17.388 --> 14:19.087
I know you think you're protecting her,

14:19.089 --> 14:20.021
but I'm telling you...

14:20.023 --> 14:21.624
Hey, babe.

14:21.626 --> 14:25.461
The pneumonia again?
Is that what did this to you?

14:25.463 --> 14:29.765
I don't know, b-b-but
I'm-I'm feeling better now.

14:29.767 --> 14:31.800
Well, I canceled
the reservation for tonight.

14:31.802 --> 14:33.468
I don't want to go anywhere
till they know what's up.

14:33.470 --> 14:34.469
I wish you hadn't.

14:34.471 --> 14:36.004
I really want to get back on the road.

14:37.573 --> 14:39.040
Are you doing tests?

14:39.042 --> 14:41.743
Are we getting answers here, or what?

14:46.148 --> 14:48.215
I need to go talk to Dr. Lin.

14:48.217 --> 14:49.250
Excuse me.

14:55.524 --> 14:57.224
Maggie.

14:57.226 --> 14:58.293
Yeah?

14:58.295 --> 15:00.060
Something else triggered the collapse...

15:00.062 --> 15:02.897
a, uh, pulmonary embolism,
a-a-a pneumonia-causing sepsis.

15:02.899 --> 15:05.266
Yeah, either could be
a complication of cancer.

15:05.268 --> 15:06.466
Good. Admit him.

15:06.468 --> 15:08.602
I feel like a jerk
every time I look at his wife.

15:08.604 --> 15:12.472
He's making me a liar.
I want him out of my E.R.

15:17.912 --> 15:19.680
Travis, where are you going?

15:22.116 --> 15:23.350
I got to go home.

15:23.352 --> 15:24.984
Hey, there's no rush.

15:24.986 --> 15:26.687
It's not your problem.

15:26.689 --> 15:28.822
Well, you can't go, all right?

15:28.824 --> 15:30.190
We need to get you back to a bed

15:30.192 --> 15:31.525
before you do permanent damage.

15:31.992 --> 15:33.960
Little help over here, please.

15:33.962 --> 15:36.863
- Travis!
- Oh! Aah! Aah!

15:36.865 --> 15:40.800
Hey. Hey, Travis, Travis,
just try to take it easy, okay?

15:42.137 --> 15:43.369
Okay, just don't move your leg.
Just stay still.

15:43.371 --> 15:44.470
Son of a bitch!

15:44.472 --> 15:47.707
My stomach. I bumped my stomach.

15:47.709 --> 15:49.709
Your stomach hurts now, too?

15:49.711 --> 15:51.944
Oh! I screwed up. I screwed up.

15:51.946 --> 15:55.314
Okay, Travis, you have to
tell me what's happening.

15:55.316 --> 15:56.882
- No!
- Okay. Okay.

15:56.884 --> 15:59.385
Just try to relax, okay? It's all right.

16:04.891 --> 16:06.992
Hey, h-he kicked me out of the room.

16:06.994 --> 16:08.460
I'm sorry to hear that.

16:08.462 --> 16:10.462
But Dr. Lin was setting up an ECG,

16:10.464 --> 16:12.630
but she didn't think it was his heart.

16:12.632 --> 16:15.734
Well, heart monitors can give us
all sorts of information.

16:15.736 --> 16:18.337
You'd tell me if it was serious,
though, right?

16:18.339 --> 16:21.173
I'm sorry, but your husband
is no longer my patient.

16:21.175 --> 16:22.841
What aren't you telling me?

16:22.843 --> 16:24.376
I wish I could help you.

16:24.378 --> 16:26.978
But he d... he doesn't know
what's good for him.

16:26.980 --> 16:28.580
He never has.

16:28.582 --> 16:32.350
I'm sorry, but my hands are tied.

16:32.352 --> 16:34.151
Doctor, please.

16:41.293 --> 16:43.094
What?

16:43.096 --> 16:46.197
I'm not telling you anything.

16:46.199 --> 16:48.165
I can see that.

16:48.167 --> 16:50.801
I'm not telling you anything,
but I'm also walking this way.

17:00.011 --> 17:02.646
Just try and relax, Mike, okay?

17:07.050 --> 17:08.218
Mike?

17:13.124 --> 17:14.156
Get her out of here.

17:16.394 --> 17:18.361
No more lies, Mike. What's going on?

17:20.898 --> 17:22.165
Zach.

17:22.166 --> 17:25.301
Let's just give him
a few more minutes to be done.

17:25.304 --> 17:26.303
No. Mike.

17:26.305 --> 17:27.637
Let's go.

17:27.638 --> 17:29.572
Mike!

17:37.414 --> 17:39.181
Brianna, what are you doing?

17:39.183 --> 17:41.350
You shouldn't be in here on your own.

17:41.352 --> 17:43.018
I know what I'm doing.

17:43.020 --> 17:44.653
Let's not try to do everything
in one day, okay?

17:44.655 --> 17:45.654
Let me help you sit.

17:45.656 --> 17:47.489
I will. I will. Just check this out.

17:47.491 --> 17:49.391
Brianna, what are you...

17:49.393 --> 17:50.392
aah!

17:50.394 --> 17:51.860
Brianna. Brianna. Hey.

17:51.862 --> 17:53.062
It's okay. It's okay.

17:53.064 --> 17:55.264
- I got you. I got you.
- Ah.

17:55.266 --> 17:57.699
- Ah.
- I got you.

17:57.701 --> 17:58.867
Let me see.

17:58.869 --> 18:02.103
Aah! Ah. I'm fine.
I'm-I'm fine, seriously.

18:02.105 --> 18:05.006
You're obviously not fine.

18:05.008 --> 18:06.875
Aah!

18:06.877 --> 18:10.078
You've dislocated your shoulder.

18:11.482 --> 18:13.782
Travis, your heart rate
and blood pressure are elevated,

18:13.784 --> 18:14.916
and you're burning up.

18:14.918 --> 18:16.618
Do you have a history of heart problems?

18:16.620 --> 18:18.052
I can't be here!

18:18.054 --> 18:21.255
Let me go! Let me go!

18:21.257 --> 18:22.357
He tried to discharge himself.

18:22.359 --> 18:24.558
I'll bet he did. Have a look at his C.T.

18:24.560 --> 18:26.394
Drugs. He's packing.

18:26.396 --> 18:27.962
Yep, that's why he wanted to leave.

18:27.964 --> 18:28.963
Charlie, he fell.

18:28.965 --> 18:30.531
If one of these packages ruptured...

18:30.533 --> 18:31.932
Then he's got drugs leaking into
his digestive tract.

18:31.934 --> 18:33.767
Yeah, I have to get them out.

18:36.776 --> 18:38.497
Let me go!

18:38.499 --> 18:40.979
Would you get these straps off of me?!

18:41.258 --> 18:43.577
They're trying to kill me in here!

18:43.668 --> 18:45.604
I need morphine and more clonazepam.

18:45.654 --> 18:46.472
- Coming in.
- Please just let me go. Hey!

18:46.474 --> 18:47.674
Travis, listen to me.

18:47.676 --> 18:49.208
What are you even doing, man?!

18:49.210 --> 18:50.810
We're trying to save your life.

18:50.812 --> 18:52.411
Hey! Hey! What are you
putting in me right now?

18:52.413 --> 18:54.012
Okay, there are drugs
leaking into your abdomen.

18:54.014 --> 18:55.281
We're giving you activated charcoal

18:55.283 --> 18:57.183
to absorb them before they hit
your bloodstream.

18:57.185 --> 18:59.585
We're dosing him
a little over my comfort zone.

18:59.587 --> 19:00.719
It's calming him down.

19:00.721 --> 19:02.154
I don't want another package to rupture.

19:02.156 --> 19:03.322
What's happening?

19:03.324 --> 19:04.423
Travis, I need to know what exactly

19:04.425 --> 19:05.857
was in those packages that you swallowed.

19:05.859 --> 19:06.958
Am I right that it's cocaine?

19:06.960 --> 19:09.294
Yeah.

19:09.296 --> 19:10.595
Okay, well, we're giving you things

19:10.597 --> 19:11.830
that will manage your heart rate.

19:11.832 --> 19:13.165
Can you get it out of me?

19:13.167 --> 19:14.332
We'll take care of you.

19:14.334 --> 19:15.600
I messed everything up.

19:15.602 --> 19:16.835
Well, it doesn't matter now.

19:16.837 --> 19:18.536
I'm scared of jail.

19:18.538 --> 19:20.872
And then if I made some money in there,

19:20.874 --> 19:22.007
I would send it back to Kim and the baby.

19:22.009 --> 19:23.675
So you smuggled cocaine.

19:23.677 --> 19:24.942
I was gonna pay those guys back.

19:24.944 --> 19:26.877
Okay, well, Dr. Reid's
gonna take you to surgery.

19:26.879 --> 19:28.680
I'm gonna get those bags out
before another one ruptures.

19:28.682 --> 19:30.281
- Do you understand?
- Am I gonna die?

19:30.283 --> 19:32.650
I don't want to die
before I meet my daughter.

19:35.487 --> 19:38.089
You've known for a year?

19:38.091 --> 19:41.291
The trip. We were busy planning.

19:41.293 --> 19:44.028
You've seen an oncologist?

19:44.030 --> 19:45.029
Yep.

19:45.031 --> 19:47.998
Well, what will the treatment be?

19:48.000 --> 19:49.499
What's the plan?

19:49.501 --> 19:52.703
Mike has chosen to forgo treatment.

19:52.705 --> 19:54.404
No, you didn't.

19:54.406 --> 19:56.040
No, Mike.

19:56.042 --> 19:57.807
His oncologist gives chemo

19:57.809 --> 20:00.410
less than 10% chance of success.

20:00.412 --> 20:02.912
So you just made up your mind?

20:02.914 --> 20:05.248
To go on living?

20:05.250 --> 20:07.117
Yeah.

20:07.119 --> 20:08.184
W-w-when can we get back on the road?

20:08.186 --> 20:09.518
Don't answer that. No way.

20:09.520 --> 20:11.888
There's no way we're
getting back on the road, okay?

20:11.890 --> 20:12.889
No.

20:12.891 --> 20:13.957
We can stick to our plan, babe.

20:13.959 --> 20:15.191
Come on, w-we can go north from here.

20:15.193 --> 20:17.393
Growing old together was our plan.

20:17.395 --> 20:19.995
Our plan now is to beat this cancer, okay?

20:19.997 --> 20:21.864
That's me making up my mind.

20:27.438 --> 20:29.405
Paulette...

20:29.407 --> 20:32.375
I am so sorry that you have to
experience this.

20:32.377 --> 20:35.911
This kind of thing is curable now, right?

20:35.913 --> 20:37.913
At least, there's a chance.

20:37.915 --> 20:41.416
The cancer had already spread
when they discovered it.

20:41.418 --> 20:43.618
So they cut it out, right?

20:43.620 --> 20:46.755
W... who sets that up? You? Can you do it?

20:46.757 --> 20:49.357
He's stage four.

20:49.359 --> 20:52.160
It's... we're already beyond
that type of intervention.

20:52.162 --> 20:54.396
Well, what about experimental drug trials?

20:54.398 --> 20:55.830
Uh, maybe there's a-a...

20:55.832 --> 20:58.166
I should be getting him on a list somewhere.

20:58.168 --> 20:59.867
I mean, maybe you know someone.

20:59.869 --> 21:03.871
You could... you could set it up.

21:03.873 --> 21:05.707
The survival rate of this type of cancer...

21:05.709 --> 21:08.442
it's low.

21:08.444 --> 21:10.845
I understand why he's forgone treatment.

21:10.847 --> 21:13.647
What, so-so I'm just supposed
to let him die,

21:13.649 --> 21:15.049
without trying anything?

21:38.406 --> 21:39.606
Whatcha doin'?

21:39.608 --> 21:42.943
You never wear gloves
and always lose umbrellas.

21:42.945 --> 21:48.481
When you're concentrating,
your eyes crinkle.

21:48.483 --> 21:49.916
It's you.

21:49.918 --> 21:50.917
What's me?

21:50.919 --> 21:53.220
I have something for her.

21:53.222 --> 21:54.554
What is it?

21:54.556 --> 21:57.490
Her future.

21:59.037 --> 22:00.399
Okay, whatever that means,

22:00.449 --> 22:02.962
why don't you give it to me instead?

22:02.964 --> 22:05.998
I should have given it back a long time ago.

22:09.970 --> 22:11.471
Sorry to interrupt.

22:11.473 --> 22:13.638
Mike, would you like some privacy?

22:13.640 --> 22:15.875
There's no point now. Just tell me.

22:20.680 --> 22:23.582
You have a pulmonary embolism.

22:23.584 --> 22:25.351
It's a clot in the lungs,

22:25.353 --> 22:27.253
and we need to treat it right away.

22:27.255 --> 22:28.387
I'm already dying.

22:28.389 --> 22:30.422
Mike, if we don't act right away,

22:30.424 --> 22:32.624
you may not make it through tonight.

22:35.928 --> 22:38.597
Can you fix it?

22:38.599 --> 22:40.599
I hope so.

22:40.601 --> 22:42.934
Then what?

22:42.936 --> 22:45.937
Let's not worry about "then what."

22:45.939 --> 22:48.339
Let's focus on "right now."

22:48.341 --> 22:50.942
I'm gonna have him right back with you

22:50.944 --> 22:52.076
as soon as I can.

22:58.676 --> 23:01.081
I just wanted to prove that I could do it.

23:01.131 --> 23:01.986
Yeah, but now it's gonna be weeks

23:01.988 --> 23:04.121
before you can put
any real weight on that arm,

23:04.123 --> 23:06.657
which means that any hope
of using a walker for support...

23:06.659 --> 23:09.259
- Isn't gonna happen.
- It's not gonna happen.

23:09.261 --> 23:10.461
Add it to the list.

23:10.463 --> 23:13.664
You know that your wedding,
uh, your marriage,

23:13.666 --> 23:17.668
is more than just your ability
to walk down an aisle, right?

23:17.670 --> 23:19.303
I know that.

23:19.305 --> 23:21.704
I totally love Jeff,

23:21.706 --> 23:24.341
and I've got nothing to prove to him.

23:24.343 --> 23:26.643
But my friends and my family...

23:26.645 --> 23:28.812
You've got nothing to prove
to anybody but yourself.

23:28.814 --> 23:30.314
Okay?

23:31.649 --> 23:33.216
Dr. Goran...

23:34.486 --> 23:36.419
I drove drunk.

23:38.188 --> 23:40.690
I ruined my life...

23:40.692 --> 23:42.692
Thankfully, no one else's.

23:43.628 --> 23:46.934
I can't change the mistakes that I've made,

23:47.272 --> 23:49.599
but I have to try to put them behind me.

23:50.262 --> 23:52.491
Yeah, I know what you mean.

23:54.914 --> 23:57.196
My father's the worst.

23:57.826 --> 23:59.821
I'm his little broken princess now.

23:59.940 --> 24:02.011
Just thinking of the way he looks at me,

24:02.013 --> 24:03.145
I just want to be sick.

24:03.147 --> 24:04.680
I'm sorry you feel that way.

24:04.682 --> 24:06.282
Don't feel sorry for me.

24:06.284 --> 24:08.150
I nearly stepped.

24:08.898 --> 24:10.876
Then that stupid leg gave out.

24:11.020 --> 24:12.456
What do you mean, it "gave out"?

24:12.522 --> 24:14.623
I don't know,
it-it felt okay for a minute,

24:14.625 --> 24:16.224
and then the muscles...

24:16.226 --> 24:19.094
i-it felt like a cramp or something.

24:19.534 --> 24:20.570
What?

24:20.620 --> 24:25.297
It... no, it's probably... nothing.

24:26.189 --> 24:27.872
And you didn't even notice?

24:28.094 --> 24:28.870
What?

24:29.492 --> 24:31.739
Your shoulder...
it's, uh, back where it belongs.

24:33.321 --> 24:35.977
Holy... I didn't even feel that.

24:35.979 --> 24:37.645
You're, like, the shoulder whisperer.

24:37.647 --> 24:38.946
Why, thank you.

24:38.948 --> 24:42.850
Okay, so let's, uh,
just keep working on your legs,

24:42.852 --> 24:45.052
- uh, back in physio.
- Okay.

24:45.054 --> 24:46.888
And stay positive.

24:50.559 --> 24:53.027
Maggie, let me know how it goes, okay?

24:53.029 --> 24:55.844
Zach, tell me you didn't
bring her up there on purpose.

24:55.898 --> 24:57.123
She followed me.

24:58.016 --> 24:59.200
I let her.

24:59.250 --> 25:01.285
Like it or not, it's his choice.

25:01.335 --> 25:02.669
Well, what difference does it make?

25:02.671 --> 25:03.670
She knows now.

25:03.672 --> 25:05.639
You know, I don't blame Mike.

25:05.641 --> 25:07.141
With all the surgeries I've seen,

25:07.143 --> 25:08.342
I would do the same thing.

25:08.344 --> 25:09.576
Well, maybe it's not all about

25:09.578 --> 25:11.828
what you want or how you feel.

25:12.445 --> 25:13.731
Whoa, easy.

25:13.781 --> 25:15.154
Look, Paulette's gonna spend
the rest of her life

25:15.204 --> 25:16.449
wondering if there was something
that she could have done.

25:16.451 --> 25:18.484
That's what he's leaving her with.

25:18.486 --> 25:20.153
What is going on with you?

25:20.155 --> 25:22.427
Never should have gotten involved.

25:23.727 --> 25:25.525
This guy's like a piñata...

25:25.783 --> 25:27.860
But he's full of drugs
instead of cheap candy.

25:27.910 --> 25:30.196
Well, this candy is not cheap.

25:30.198 --> 25:32.698
He's lucky they didn't burst
when he was beaten up.

25:32.700 --> 25:34.667
Can you suction some of this charcoal?

25:34.669 --> 25:35.734
I can't see anything.

25:37.037 --> 25:38.271
At least he had a plan.

25:38.273 --> 25:39.805
Yeah, I guess so.

25:39.807 --> 25:41.474
Okay, nearly there.

25:41.476 --> 25:45.678
Wow, this one is in the small bowel.

25:45.680 --> 25:46.712
Got it...

25:46.714 --> 25:47.646
Oh, my god.

25:47.648 --> 25:49.648
Okay, saline... lots of it.

25:49.650 --> 25:50.950
Uh, you flush. I'll suction.

25:50.952 --> 25:51.951
I just have to get the rest of them out.

25:51.953 --> 25:53.452
I can't have another one bursting.

26:01.517 --> 26:02.953
Okay, all set?

26:03.027 --> 26:04.742
I guess.

26:06.860 --> 26:09.351
I'm so sorry you had to cancel
your trip, Mike.

26:09.986 --> 26:11.020
It sounded amazing.

26:12.939 --> 26:15.957
We were just getting to the good stuff.

26:16.197 --> 26:18.516
20 years in...

26:19.693 --> 26:22.338
You know, you're past
the trying-too-hard phase,

26:22.424 --> 26:25.165
past the not-trying-enough phase.

26:25.167 --> 26:26.634
Mm, the sweet spot.

26:27.754 --> 26:30.543
I told her that I'd never leave her alone.

26:30.707 --> 26:32.873
She's strong.

26:33.620 --> 26:34.808
So are you.

26:36.231 --> 26:38.846
We're not gonna make it.

26:39.645 --> 26:41.439
No Churchill,

26:41.924 --> 26:44.527
- no northern lights.
- Okay.

26:45.120 --> 26:47.143
Time to sleep, Mike.

26:47.422 --> 26:50.257
Just relax.

27:01.802 --> 27:03.837
Talk to me about
these exoskeleton prototypes.

27:03.839 --> 27:05.839
that might be just the push
her muscles need.

27:05.841 --> 27:07.499
Oh, that'll definitely
help her begin to step.

27:07.549 --> 27:10.343
Yeah. A few little steps
is all she really needs now.

27:10.345 --> 27:11.911
Hey, Shahir.

27:14.113 --> 27:15.375
When Alex goes into labor,

27:15.425 --> 27:17.028
I want to be the first person that you call.

27:17.078 --> 27:18.684
Okay, I'll make a note of that
on the birth plan.

27:18.686 --> 27:20.753
Okay. Cool.

27:21.397 --> 27:22.815
I got to go.

27:22.865 --> 27:24.621
But, yeah, thank you.

27:25.613 --> 27:27.529
You're welcome.

27:28.866 --> 27:30.683
Heart rate and B.P. are up.

27:30.733 --> 27:32.473
Gonna try to ease him down.

27:32.523 --> 27:35.224
Alex, you need to get that last bag out.
We need to flush.

27:35.274 --> 27:36.268
Yeah. I know.

27:36.270 --> 27:37.779
All right.

27:39.039 --> 27:40.972
Okay.

27:41.022 --> 27:43.327
That's it. Okay. Saline.

27:44.027 --> 27:45.992
- Get that suction ready.
- Got it.

27:46.042 --> 27:48.065
Let's go. Follow me in here.

27:48.115 --> 27:49.480
Okay.

27:49.482 --> 27:51.649
Good. Dr. Sharpe?

27:51.651 --> 27:53.018
Still elevated.

27:53.020 --> 27:55.020
More saline.

27:55.022 --> 27:57.021
Come on.

27:57.023 --> 27:59.356
Come on.

27:59.358 --> 28:00.357
Okay.

28:01.760 --> 28:03.661
Okay.

28:03.663 --> 28:04.995
I think that we've got it all.

28:04.997 --> 28:06.397
Dr. Sharpe?

28:06.399 --> 28:08.332
How are we doing?

28:08.334 --> 28:10.234
It's good. Looks like he's stabilizing.

28:11.369 --> 28:12.503
Yes.

28:15.874 --> 28:17.007
You paged me.

28:17.009 --> 28:19.143
Tiger pacing in his cage.

28:19.145 --> 28:20.510
He waits for you.

28:20.512 --> 28:22.646
Says his daughter's your patient.

28:24.649 --> 28:25.749
Mr. Pierre.

28:29.219 --> 28:30.386
What do you think you're doing?

28:30.388 --> 28:31.720
I beg your pardon?

28:31.722 --> 28:33.189
Telling Brianna she's going to walk again

28:33.191 --> 28:34.357
just so you can do some study?

28:34.359 --> 28:35.391
I never said "walk."

28:35.393 --> 28:36.725
I said she might regain some mobility,

28:36.727 --> 28:38.361
and I'm still pretty optimistic she will.

28:38.363 --> 28:40.830
Was her injuring herself
part of your study, Dr. Goran?

28:40.832 --> 28:42.765
Okay, that was just your daughter
being a little ambitious.

28:42.767 --> 28:44.267
I did actually warn her to take it easy.

28:44.269 --> 28:45.768
Brianna doesn't listen to caution.

28:45.770 --> 28:47.202
You say "maybe," she hears "yes."

28:47.204 --> 28:48.604
Yes, she has incredible perseverance,

28:48.606 --> 28:49.872
which I think is to be applauded,

28:49.874 --> 28:51.574
especially after
everything she's been through.

28:51.576 --> 28:54.877
She needs to accept who she is now,

28:54.879 --> 28:56.378
what she's done to her life.

28:56.380 --> 28:58.514
I think it's the acceptance
of other people that she's looking for.

28:58.516 --> 28:59.515
What's that supposed to mean?

28:59.517 --> 29:00.716
All that your daughter seems to want

29:00.718 --> 29:02.451
is to walk down that aisle.

29:02.453 --> 29:05.220
Now, I think I might be able
to make that happen.

29:05.222 --> 29:09.358
The question here is,
does she have your support?

29:13.963 --> 29:15.897
Yeah, spasticity in the muscle.

29:15.899 --> 29:18.367
That's really typical
after an injury like yours.

29:18.369 --> 29:20.502
How you get from that
to putting botox in my leg,

29:20.504 --> 29:21.970
I'm not quite getting.

29:21.972 --> 29:25.272
Okay, so, your brain, despite
its many wonderful qualities,

29:25.274 --> 29:27.308
is kind of misbehaving right now.

29:27.310 --> 29:29.611
It's sending signals to these muscles,

29:29.613 --> 29:31.679
and it's telling them to contract.

29:31.681 --> 29:32.413
Bad brain.

29:32.415 --> 29:33.414
Bad brain.

29:33.416 --> 29:35.850
So the botox blocks the signal.

29:35.852 --> 29:39.887
No signal means no spasms
and can also mean improvement.

29:39.889 --> 29:42.456
And by "improvement," you mean...?

29:42.458 --> 29:44.492
I mean...

29:44.494 --> 29:46.660
Stepping, Brianna.

29:46.662 --> 29:49.696
But I still can't use a walker,

29:49.698 --> 29:52.766
so I'm still a bride on wheels?

29:52.768 --> 29:55.268
Not exactly, no.

29:55.270 --> 29:57.070
All right.

29:57.072 --> 30:00.841
So, Dr. Hamza's offered us
the use of an exoskeleton.

30:00.843 --> 30:04.477
An exoskeleton... Like, robot legs?

30:04.479 --> 30:05.812
Sort of.

30:05.814 --> 30:10.150
Um, we've been using a prototype
for our mobility study.

30:10.152 --> 30:11.751
And I'm allowed to try it?

30:11.753 --> 30:13.253
Yeah, it's kind of
a special occasion, right?

30:13.255 --> 30:14.287
Are you serious?

30:14.289 --> 30:16.189
Because if you're playing with me,

30:16.191 --> 30:17.357
I am gonna rip your ears off.

30:17.407 --> 30:18.389
Oh, I am quite serious,

30:18.513 --> 30:20.368
and rather fond of my ears,
thank you very much.

30:20.418 --> 30:22.235
Plus, I know how badly you want this.

30:23.917 --> 30:26.165
I'm gonna walk down the aisle.

30:26.393 --> 30:29.396
Yeah. Well, I mean,
it's just a few steps, right?

30:33.740 --> 30:35.441
And with a little help.

30:38.779 --> 30:39.912
Come on in.

30:43.183 --> 30:44.183
Dad.

30:44.185 --> 30:46.285
Hey, kiddo.

30:46.287 --> 30:49.455
I talked to your doctor here.

30:49.457 --> 30:51.623
Um... that's interesting,

30:51.625 --> 30:55.026
because I didn't ask him to do that.

30:55.028 --> 30:57.662
Well, I'm glad he did.

31:03.970 --> 31:09.207
Sweetheart... he told me
what you're trying to do.

31:09.209 --> 31:12.744
And I just want to help.

31:12.746 --> 31:16.247
So whatever you need from me, you've got it.

31:18.283 --> 31:19.950
Thank you.

31:30.162 --> 31:31.496
Zach...

31:33.397 --> 31:34.531
I removed the clot,

31:34.533 --> 31:36.734
but he could have another one at any minute,

31:36.736 --> 31:39.436
and I don't know that
he'll make it through the night.

31:40.672 --> 31:41.905
Right.

31:45.510 --> 31:48.278
Wasn't your shift over hours ago?

31:48.280 --> 31:49.246
Yeah.

31:49.248 --> 31:51.781
I've never seen you like this.

31:51.783 --> 31:54.050
Normally, it's "treat 'em and street 'em."

31:58.422 --> 32:01.024
It was the same with my father.

32:03.761 --> 32:06.295
Lung cancer?

32:07.381 --> 32:09.923
I was 17...

32:10.035 --> 32:12.682
And my parents chose not to tell me,

32:12.732 --> 32:16.195
and I just... I continued
to go out every night

32:16.310 --> 32:18.219
and sleep in every morning

32:18.503 --> 32:20.456
and fight with my dad.

32:22.320 --> 32:24.820
They just wanted you to have a normal life.

32:25.049 --> 32:26.416
It wasn't normal.

32:26.614 --> 32:29.604
He was dead within the year.
And it's just that I would have...

32:30.282 --> 32:32.087
I would have spent that time differently

32:32.089 --> 32:34.923
if I'd have known, you know?

32:38.762 --> 32:41.096
I was out of line.

32:41.098 --> 32:43.832
I don't know that it matters anymore.

32:46.268 --> 32:49.905
You know where she is?
I need to let her know.

32:49.907 --> 32:53.075
Waiting in the I.C.U.

32:55.611 --> 32:56.611
Okay.

33:04.420 --> 33:08.690
We don't know for sure.

33:08.692 --> 33:10.658
Hours, days.

33:12.261 --> 33:14.394
But not weeks.

33:17.199 --> 33:20.567
I woke up this morning, and I...

33:20.569 --> 33:24.438
I bitched at him for not buying bread.

33:25.718 --> 33:28.709
I had no idea...

33:28.711 --> 33:30.277
No idea.

33:33.281 --> 33:34.848
I won't say there's a bright side,

33:34.850 --> 33:38.719
but at least you get to say goodbye.

33:38.721 --> 33:42.356
Not everyone gets the chance.

33:42.358 --> 33:47.026
I'm supposed to be strong now, right?

33:47.028 --> 33:52.398
I'm supposed to go in there and...

33:52.400 --> 33:58.138
Sit peacefully beside him until he...

33:58.140 --> 34:00.406
dies.

34:00.408 --> 34:02.775
And all I want to do is scream.

34:05.445 --> 34:07.913
He just wanted to protect you.

34:07.915 --> 34:14.085
And he wanted his last days
with you to be happy.

34:14.088 --> 34:16.755
They were.

34:21.661 --> 34:22.795
Thank you.

34:59.397 --> 35:02.934
There's something I'd like to do for them.

36:32.046 --> 36:34.313
- Are you ready to let me go?
- Ready when you are, yeah.

36:34.315 --> 36:37.015
Okay.

36:37.017 --> 36:38.450
Do it.

36:40.787 --> 36:41.987
Look at you.

36:46.193 --> 36:47.659
Okay, let me try to, uh, step now.

36:47.661 --> 36:50.929
Okay. And take it easy, all right?

36:50.931 --> 36:52.797
Okay. Here goes.

36:52.799 --> 36:57.435
Slowly.

36:57.437 --> 36:58.703
Slowly.

37:02.676 --> 37:04.876
I can't believe it.

37:04.878 --> 37:07.746
I did it.

37:13.719 --> 37:14.652
Oh!

37:17.890 --> 37:19.690
That's the same face you made

37:19.692 --> 37:21.892
when you took your very first steps...

37:21.894 --> 37:24.028
11 months old.

37:25.698 --> 37:28.132
You're unstoppable.

37:36.341 --> 37:38.042
You think these will fit under
my wedding dress?

37:39.145 --> 37:42.579
I think you'll make a beautiful bride.

37:53.257 --> 37:54.791
Do what you got to do.

37:54.793 --> 37:56.426
Just let me know where they tow it.

37:56.428 --> 37:59.395
Okay. Thank you.

37:59.397 --> 38:02.331
Everything okay with the beast?

38:02.333 --> 38:06.736
Oh, she's indestructible...
just a little lonesome.

38:06.738 --> 38:08.604
Anything I can do?

38:08.606 --> 38:11.107
Thank you.

38:11.109 --> 38:13.442
Thank Dr. Miller.

38:13.444 --> 38:15.578
What about you?

38:15.580 --> 38:18.747
I'm right where I need to be.

38:18.749 --> 38:22.284
And when I don't need to be here,

38:22.286 --> 38:26.555
the beast and I will get back on the road.

38:26.557 --> 38:29.592
You're gonna finish the trip on your own?

38:29.594 --> 38:31.193
Well, a plan's a plan.

38:31.195 --> 38:37.132
Anyway, Mike says...
he's gonna meet me there.

38:37.134 --> 38:40.235
I bet he will.

38:40.237 --> 38:43.772
I believe it.

38:43.774 --> 38:47.742
I do.

38:47.744 --> 38:50.478
Travis, I'd like you
to meet Dr. Dey.

38:50.480 --> 38:51.479
Shrink?

38:54.617 --> 38:56.551
How long are you set to serve?

38:56.553 --> 38:58.819
Three years.

39:01.257 --> 39:03.824
You have any idea
what they would have tacked on

39:03.826 --> 39:05.860
for smuggling drugs in there?

39:08.096 --> 39:11.799
Look, it was a terrible plan, Travis.

39:11.801 --> 39:13.267
But on the bright side,

39:13.269 --> 39:16.036
you've got time to come up with a new one...

39:16.038 --> 39:18.605
like how to start over when you get out.

39:22.843 --> 39:25.612
You okay?

39:25.614 --> 39:27.514
It's my hand... Dana's been
trying to help me with it,

39:27.516 --> 39:28.649
but it's not really working.

39:28.651 --> 39:30.617
Can I take a look?

39:30.619 --> 39:32.686
Sure. I mean, it comes and goes.

39:32.688 --> 39:33.920
It's... it's really strange.

39:33.922 --> 39:36.890
Must be kind of stressful
when you have a surgery.

39:36.892 --> 39:38.591
That's an understatement.

39:38.593 --> 39:41.294
So, you going off
to work on your birth plan?

39:41.296 --> 39:42.461
I have a new plan.

39:42.463 --> 39:44.563
It's just to have a healthy baby.

39:53.674 --> 39:55.140
I'd like to get a coffee.

39:55.142 --> 39:56.342
Do you want to get one?

39:56.344 --> 39:58.511
Yeah.

39:58.513 --> 40:03.349
Um... except I just remembered
I've got something to do,

40:03.351 --> 40:07.586
so, uh, why don't I meet you there?

40:07.588 --> 40:08.554
Okay.

40:08.556 --> 40:10.655
Hope your hand feels better.

40:10.657 --> 40:11.857
Thank you.

40:20.599 --> 40:21.633
This better be good.

40:35.147 --> 40:37.816
Where are my clothes?

40:40.453 --> 40:42.754
I'm going now.

40:42.756 --> 40:45.723
I don't want to see you... again.

40:45.725 --> 40:47.258
It... it can't be gone.

40:47.260 --> 40:49.160
I kept it for her for so long.

40:50.996 --> 40:54.598
It's in my jacket pocket.

41:13.585 --> 41:15.986
That's it. That's hers.

41:17.855 --> 41:21.358
This is Alex's handwriting.
Where'd you get this?

41:21.360 --> 41:22.825
She left it behind.

41:22.827 --> 41:26.596
Uh...

41:26.598 --> 41:28.198
"I'll never let you go."

41:28.200 --> 41:29.799
"You never wear gloves."

41:29.801 --> 41:31.601
"You always lose umbrellas."

41:35.338 --> 41:37.774
These are her wedding vows.

41:37.776 --> 41:39.375
She was in my taxi.

41:40.711 --> 41:41.977
There was an accident.

41:41.979 --> 41:45.080
She was with a man in a tuxedo.

41:45.082 --> 41:46.749
It was you.

41:50.220 --> 41:51.987
She needs them back.

41:53.885 --> 41:57.126
I'm sorry. I meant to bring them back,
but things happened.

41:57.128 --> 41:58.660
What is it? T-talk to me.

41:58.662 --> 42:01.063
Talk... talk to me! Charlie!

42:01.065 --> 42:02.298
- Charlie!
- "And..."

42:02.300 --> 42:03.232
Medic!

42:03.234 --> 42:05.100
"I'll always love you."

42:05.102 --> 42:08.102
Nobody ever wrote
something like that for me.

42:08.104 --> 42:10.371
Promise you'll give them to her.

42:12.408 --> 42:13.742
I will.

42:28.188 --> 42:29.528
Hi.

42:29.738 --> 42:31.502
I'm sorry, sir, we're about to close.

42:31.552 --> 42:33.394
No, I'll just be a minute. I, um...

42:34.193 --> 42:35.363
where is it?

42:35.365 --> 42:37.698
Uh, yes, this one here.

42:40.708 --> 42:42.530
- This one?
- Mm-hmm.

42:45.507 --> 42:47.240
It's beautiful.

42:48.977 --> 42:52.480
May I show you some others?

42:52.482 --> 42:56.049
No.

42:56.051 --> 42:59.086
No, this is it.

42:59.088 --> 43:00.387
This is the one.
