WEBVTT

00:02.735 --> 00:04.936
Sean Walker
was just an ordinary man...

00:05.004 --> 00:06.304
Sir, please sit--aah!

00:06.372 --> 00:07.305
Thrown into the middle

00:07.373 --> 00:09.774
of an extraordinary
conspiracy

00:09.841 --> 00:11.275
while on the run
from the law.

00:11.343 --> 00:12.810
I'm walking out
with Leila.

00:12.877 --> 00:16.175
He just rescued
his kidnapped fiancee,

00:16.244 --> 00:18.031
along with
one of her captors.

00:18.099 --> 00:19.564
He and I are gonna
have a little talk.

00:19.632 --> 00:20.882
And Sophia,

00:20.950 --> 00:23.016
the leader of a mysterious
group of prisoners...

00:23.084 --> 00:24.804
I didn't condone
any of this.

00:24.872 --> 00:27.017
Was keeping the peace
between the White House

00:27.085 --> 00:28.093
and her own people.

00:28.161 --> 00:29.400
Tell me what you know.

00:29.468 --> 00:30.406
Until one of them...

00:30.473 --> 00:32.087
His name is Thomas.

00:32.154 --> 00:35.177
Broke her free
from 60-year detainment.

00:35.245 --> 00:36.890
She will lead us
straight to Thomas.

00:36.958 --> 00:38.928
He's your new priority.

00:38.995 --> 00:41.342
Now a new pursuit begins.

00:41.410 --> 00:42.987
Rein him in,
like you said you could.

00:43.054 --> 00:45.032
And <i>The Event</i>
continues.

01:16.689 --> 01:18.159
Hello?

01:18.212 --> 01:19.951
Sophia...

01:20.019 --> 01:22.627
It's me.

01:22.695 --> 01:25.100
What the hell
were you thinking?

01:25.168 --> 01:27.406
That's really the first thing
you want to say to me

01:27.476 --> 01:29.345
after 66 years?

01:29.413 --> 01:31.887
You almost killed
200 people.

01:31.955 --> 01:34.193
Nobody died,
and you're free.

01:34.261 --> 01:36.968
- Everything else is details.
- Not to me.

01:37.036 --> 01:39.040
And I am far from free.

01:39.108 --> 01:41.112
We have to assume
that Martinez is doing

01:41.180 --> 01:43.017
everything in his power
to track me.

01:43.085 --> 01:44.856
If only so I'll
lead them to you.

01:44.924 --> 01:47.830
You've drawn a lot
of attention to yourself.

01:47.898 --> 01:49.367
Simon's gonna give us
the details

01:49.434 --> 01:50.738
to their follow operation.

01:50.805 --> 01:53.377
We need to get you out
so we can get started.

01:53.444 --> 01:55.348
There's a change of clothes
in your bag.

01:55.416 --> 01:58.389
It's a safe bet that
yours are compromised.

01:58.456 --> 02:00.093
And then what?

02:00.161 --> 02:01.262
Then I want you to
wait for me

02:01.330 --> 02:03.100
to tell you what to do.

02:05.306 --> 02:07.409
Okay, she just passed
the Van Ness Station.

02:07.477 --> 02:10.483
The next station's two miles.
Metro Center.

02:10.551 --> 02:11.720
Very good, Mr. Murphy.

02:11.788 --> 02:12.822
Please confirm with Andrews

02:12.890 --> 02:14.158
that the predators
have scrambled.

02:14.226 --> 02:17.465
Agent Lee, once the drones
start transmitting video,

02:17.534 --> 02:18.835
I want it fed to your teams
on the ground.

02:18.903 --> 02:20.673
I'll set up
a dedicated overlay, sir.

02:20.740 --> 02:21.808
Where are we?

02:21.876 --> 02:24.581
Sophia's train
is proceeding east

02:24.648 --> 02:25.850
on the red line right now.

02:25.917 --> 02:27.452
It's approaching
the Metro Center Station.

02:27.521 --> 02:29.691
Are we sure she's still
on the train?

02:29.759 --> 02:31.294
We're getting a clear signal
from the scandium-46

02:31.362 --> 02:32.730
in her bloodstream.

02:32.798 --> 02:34.300
And how long will
the isotopes stay active?

02:34.367 --> 02:35.636
Seven hours.

02:35.704 --> 02:38.341
If she hasn't led us
to this man Thomas by then,

02:38.409 --> 02:39.978
we'll reacquire her.

02:40.046 --> 02:43.051
Thomas is the target
of the operation, not Sophia.

02:43.118 --> 02:44.353
I don't want her hurt.

02:44.421 --> 02:47.826
Sophia has proven herself
far from trustworthy.

02:47.894 --> 02:51.199
In my opinion, we must
consider her a threat.

02:51.267 --> 02:54.940
She survives this, Blake.
Am I clear?

02:56.978 --> 02:59.749
Pull me out if there are
any major developments.

02:59.816 --> 03:01.217
Yes, Mr. President.

03:01.285 --> 03:04.189
Sir, I'd like to
join my men in the field.

03:04.257 --> 03:05.859
Supervise their deployment
in person.

03:09.734 --> 03:11.336
Thomas, it's Simon.

03:11.403 --> 03:12.538
And we have a problem.

03:12.606 --> 03:14.108
They've got a tracker
in Sophia.

03:14.175 --> 03:15.243
In her?

03:15.311 --> 03:16.679
They put it in her food.

03:16.747 --> 03:18.048
It's a radioactive
isotope.

03:18.115 --> 03:19.183
While it's active,
they'll be able

03:19.251 --> 03:20.418
to track her
wherever she goes.

03:20.486 --> 03:22.255
There must be some way
to get it out.

03:22.323 --> 03:23.457
There isn't.

03:23.525 --> 03:25.594
But there may be another way
to deal with it.

03:25.662 --> 03:26.696
Good.

03:26.764 --> 03:29.500
I'm counting on you.

03:39.151 --> 03:40.886
Hey.

03:40.954 --> 03:41.921
How was it?

03:41.989 --> 03:43.090
Oh, it was nice.

03:43.157 --> 03:44.859
It looks rough.
You should come in.

03:44.927 --> 03:46.462
Hey, give me a kiss.

03:46.529 --> 03:49.667
No, it's--it's warm.

03:49.735 --> 03:51.303
I swear.

03:51.371 --> 03:52.471
You'll love it.

03:52.539 --> 03:54.609
I like watching you.
Yeah?

03:54.676 --> 03:57.579
Mm-hmm.
You look happy.

03:57.648 --> 04:01.653
Like you're discovering water
for the first time.

04:01.721 --> 04:05.191
Yeah, well, where I'm from
there wasn't any.

04:05.259 --> 04:08.530
You never talk
about your past.

04:08.598 --> 04:11.565
Well...

04:11.633 --> 04:14.534
When I'm with you...

04:14.601 --> 04:15.935
It doesn't matter.

04:16.002 --> 04:19.204
For the first time
in my life,

04:19.272 --> 04:21.272
I'm free of it.

04:26.411 --> 04:28.813
I love you, Mason.

04:33.852 --> 04:35.519
I love you.

04:35.587 --> 04:38.322
I love you too.

04:52.734 --> 04:55.302
Hey, have Sophia get off

04:55.370 --> 04:57.403
at the Gallery Place Station
and walk east.

04:57.471 --> 05:01.507
By that time, I'll know
if this will work.

05:01.574 --> 05:03.042
Change of plans.

05:03.109 --> 05:05.010
They've deployed a radioactive
isotope in your bloodstream.

05:05.078 --> 05:06.879
How?

05:06.946 --> 05:08.914
Your friend Martinez
put it in your food.

05:23.893 --> 05:25.427
Sir, she just got off
at a stop.

05:25.495 --> 05:27.028
Location?

05:27.096 --> 05:28.496
Uh, Ggallery.

05:28.564 --> 05:30.965
It's Chinatown.

05:35.470 --> 05:39.573
Get up to the street
and take an immediate left.

05:39.640 --> 05:41.674
Command just reported
the target exited

05:41.741 --> 05:44.009
the Gallery Place Station.
What's your position?

05:44.077 --> 05:45.744
We're three blocks away from
the station and closing.

05:45.812 --> 05:46.979
No, hold your approach.

05:47.046 --> 05:50.048
I don't want the team
getting any closer.

05:50.115 --> 05:51.615
Ahead of you
is Sixth Street.

05:51.683 --> 05:54.118
Gonna make a left,
continue on.

05:54.185 --> 05:56.953
Across the street you will see
the place I've been describing.

05:57.021 --> 05:59.022
Oh.

06:02.025 --> 06:03.658
Okay, she's on to Sixth,

06:03.726 --> 06:05.393
crossing east,
entering a building.

06:05.461 --> 06:08.629
Which is...

06:08.697 --> 06:12.299
It's a coffee shop.

06:12.366 --> 06:14.901
Is it possible she's
stopping for coffee?

06:14.968 --> 06:17.103
Thank you.

06:45.127 --> 06:46.694
Target's holding.

06:46.762 --> 06:48.629
Is that--

06:48.697 --> 06:50.764
is that right?

06:55.136 --> 06:57.603
Okay, we've got
a second target.

06:57.671 --> 06:59.805
What do you mean
a second target?

06:59.873 --> 07:01.239
Is this right?

07:01.307 --> 07:02.274
I think so.

07:02.341 --> 07:04.175
Okay, now we have
three targets.

07:04.243 --> 07:05.877
What the hell
is happening?

07:05.944 --> 07:07.611
I don't know, sir.

07:11.683 --> 07:13.617
Okay, now we have
five targets.

07:13.684 --> 07:16.519
They keep coming.

07:16.587 --> 07:18.321
Have Simon move
his men in.

07:18.389 --> 07:19.389
Yes, sir.

08:07.156 --> 08:09.724
I knew you were
looking for me.

08:12.933 --> 08:16.001
That's what kept me going.

08:22.941 --> 08:26.877
I need you to tell me what
happened to my dad.

08:29.114 --> 08:32.448
To my family.

08:34.485 --> 08:35.751
What's your name?

08:41.323 --> 08:44.491
What's your name?

08:44.559 --> 08:45.992
I don't think so.

08:46.060 --> 08:49.094
I'll just I.D. you
off your fingerprints.

08:49.162 --> 08:50.995
Good luck with that.

08:51.063 --> 08:53.064
Hmm.

08:53.131 --> 08:55.266
Who was it
that you work for?

08:55.334 --> 08:57.000
I need a doctor.

08:57.068 --> 08:58.335
I think I asked you
a question.

08:58.403 --> 09:01.438
You can keep asking me
questions all day.

09:01.505 --> 09:03.706
But if I bleed to death
on your watch,

09:03.774 --> 09:05.374
you're gonna have
a real problem, aren't you?

09:05.442 --> 09:06.676
You're right.

09:06.744 --> 09:09.448
But not as big a problem
as you.

09:09.515 --> 09:12.286
I don't understand.

09:12.354 --> 09:15.789
What do you mean the plane
was pulled from the sky?

09:15.857 --> 09:17.190
That's what it felt like,

09:17.258 --> 09:19.459
that, like,
we were being moved

09:19.526 --> 09:20.860
by something.

09:20.927 --> 09:22.961
One second,
we were in Miami.

09:23.029 --> 09:24.396
The next,
we were 2,000 miles away,

09:24.464 --> 09:26.598
crash-landing in Arizona.

09:26.665 --> 09:29.200
That just doesn't make
any sense.

09:29.268 --> 09:31.035
You're right

09:31.102 --> 09:33.104
I know.

09:33.172 --> 09:34.772
Well, I mean, my dad--

09:34.840 --> 09:37.375
how'd he explain it?

09:37.442 --> 09:39.276
He didn't.
He didn't explain it.

09:39.344 --> 09:41.010
Almost right when we landed,

09:41.078 --> 09:44.280
there were these--
some kind of aircraft

09:44.348 --> 09:47.116
started moving in,
and he--

09:47.183 --> 09:48.417
he said they weren't there
to help us

09:48.484 --> 09:49.984
and that I needed
to find you.

09:50.052 --> 09:51.753
So I--I just ran.

09:51.820 --> 09:54.388
Well--well, where is he?

09:54.455 --> 09:56.356
Where's my dad
and the rest of the passengers?

09:56.424 --> 09:57.724
Well, they're saying
on the news

09:57.792 --> 10:00.826
that they lost track
of the plane over in Brazil

10:00.894 --> 10:03.028
and that they're still looking
for the passengers.

10:03.096 --> 10:05.230
So all I know
is that the government

10:05.297 --> 10:06.964
is not telling us
the truth.

10:07.032 --> 10:08.165
Well, what about my mom?

10:08.233 --> 10:09.800
I mean, she must be
looking for him.

10:09.867 --> 10:12.669
I tried calling the house
at the police station,

10:12.737 --> 10:14.271
but no one's picking up.

10:18.642 --> 10:21.810
Uh, Leila, I, um...

10:23.512 --> 10:25.279
I have to--

10:25.347 --> 10:28.115
I have to tell you something.

10:28.183 --> 10:30.851
Your father told me that...

10:33.754 --> 10:35.722
That they killed your mom.

10:37.891 --> 10:39.892
- What?
- I'm so sorry.

10:39.959 --> 10:43.194
- What?
- I'm so sorry.

10:43.262 --> 10:45.262
No.

10:49.166 --> 10:52.302
I'm so sorry.

10:52.370 --> 10:55.372
What about Samantha?

10:55.439 --> 10:57.206
The people
who are behind this,

10:57.274 --> 10:58.741
they took her just like they
took you for the same reason,

10:58.809 --> 11:01.643
to force your dad
to do what he did.

11:01.711 --> 11:03.177
No, they wouldn't--

11:03.245 --> 11:06.613
they didn't hurt
a little girl, right?

11:06.681 --> 11:07.881
Tell me she's okay.

11:07.948 --> 11:10.884
As far as I know,
she is alive.

11:10.952 --> 11:12.219
We'll find her, okay?

11:12.286 --> 11:15.388
We'll find them.

11:28.298 --> 11:31.233
I'll explain more
when I see you, all right?

11:31.300 --> 11:32.867
Bye.

11:35.404 --> 11:37.237
What did you do to her?

11:37.305 --> 11:39.005
What?

11:39.073 --> 11:42.008
Where is she?

11:42.076 --> 11:43.743
I don't know.

11:43.811 --> 11:45.244
Who?

11:45.312 --> 11:46.845
My sister.

11:46.913 --> 11:48.580
Where's my sister?

11:48.648 --> 11:50.982
I don't know what
you're talking about.

11:51.049 --> 11:52.817
Please.
Please just tell me, okay?

11:52.884 --> 11:54.084
Just tell me where she is.

11:54.152 --> 11:56.353
She didn't do anything.

11:56.421 --> 11:59.756
I don't know anything
about your sister.

12:03.127 --> 12:04.827
Where is my sister?

12:04.895 --> 12:05.995
Ow! Ow!
Where is she?

12:06.062 --> 12:08.197
Get her off of me!

12:08.265 --> 12:09.432
Where's my sister?

12:09.499 --> 12:10.599
She's only seven!

12:10.667 --> 12:11.767
Where is she?

12:11.834 --> 12:14.268
Answer her.
I will let you die here.

12:14.335 --> 12:15.669
I don't know anything.

12:15.737 --> 12:18.571
All I know is I'm bleeding out
in some fleabag motel.

12:18.639 --> 12:21.607
You want to blame somebody,
why don't you blame your father?

12:21.674 --> 12:23.441
That's right.

12:23.509 --> 12:26.778
Oh, you didn't know?

12:26.845 --> 12:30.748
He's no angel.

12:30.815 --> 12:33.783
Way I heard it,
he brought this on himself.

12:54.828 --> 12:56.728
Still being flooded
by false targets.

12:56.813 --> 12:59.047
- 43 and counting.
- Now how is that possible?

12:59.115 --> 13:00.782
Best guess,
one of Thomas' people

13:00.850 --> 13:02.016
got here ahead of us.

13:02.084 --> 13:03.217
We don't have enough manpower

13:03.285 --> 13:04.518
to track everyone
who's been dosed.

13:04.586 --> 13:06.820
No, but we can minimize
the confusion.

13:06.888 --> 13:09.022
We'll lock down
the coffee shop.

13:09.123 --> 13:10.490
That's a good idea.

13:10.558 --> 13:12.758
Use Dasilva, Rutherford,
Berdan, and Hayes.

13:12.826 --> 13:14.026
What's our story?

13:14.094 --> 13:16.261
Possible Homeland Security
threat in the vicinity.

13:16.329 --> 13:17.529
No reason to panic.

13:17.596 --> 13:19.363
That one doesn't work
as well as it used to.

13:19.431 --> 13:21.699
Better be compelling then.

13:21.766 --> 13:23.534
The rest of you,
resume the search.

13:23.601 --> 13:25.269
Set a half-mile perimeter
and work your way back.

13:25.336 --> 13:26.603
Sophia's on foot.

13:26.671 --> 13:28.471
Okay, she couldn't
have gotten far.

13:28.539 --> 13:32.006
Let's go.

13:32.074 --> 13:34.675
Coming up on Spring Street.

13:38.311 --> 13:39.845
Hey.

13:39.913 --> 13:41.279
Come on, come on, hey.

13:41.347 --> 13:43.314
We need to keep you away
from the CCTV cameras.

13:43.382 --> 13:44.850
You can avoid most of them,

13:44.918 --> 13:46.919
but there are areas
of vulnerability.

13:46.987 --> 13:49.088
So keep your head down.

13:49.155 --> 13:51.723
Somebody give me a hard count
on the isotope targets.

13:51.791 --> 13:53.959
Uh, 59 and holding, sir.

13:54.027 --> 13:55.026
Continuing to disperse.

13:55.094 --> 13:56.127
Now one of those targets
is Sophia.

13:56.195 --> 13:57.261
I want an immediate override

13:57.329 --> 14:00.798
on all CCTV and traffic
cameras in the area.

14:00.865 --> 14:01.899
Once they reroute,

14:01.966 --> 14:03.833
port it directly
to facial recognition.

14:03.901 --> 14:05.101
Uploading now, sir.

14:05.169 --> 14:06.602
Sir, may I have a word?

14:06.670 --> 14:09.104
What's going on?

14:09.172 --> 14:12.107
Whoever dosed the people
at the coffee shop

14:12.175 --> 14:14.943
did it with the same isotope
we used on Sophia.

14:15.010 --> 14:16.310
And?

14:16.378 --> 14:19.180
Scandium-46
is hard to source.

14:19.247 --> 14:21.682
So I checked our own
stockpile.

14:21.750 --> 14:24.885
40 minutes ago someone walked
out of our on-site armory

14:24.953 --> 14:26.753
with 100 ccs
of liquid scandium.

14:28.823 --> 14:31.257
Who's authorized
to access the armory?

14:31.325 --> 14:32.925
Only the men
on our field teams.

14:32.993 --> 14:35.461
I'm sorry, sir,
but it has to be one of them.

14:35.528 --> 14:39.164
But the good news is scandium
is a volatile particulate.

14:39.232 --> 14:42.067
Anyone who's handled it
will have trace amounts on them.

14:42.135 --> 14:45.470
I can vet the field teams
with the radiation detector.

14:47.606 --> 14:48.873
Do it.

14:48.974 --> 14:50.607
We need to find the traitor

14:50.675 --> 14:52.609
before he undermines
the entire operation.

14:52.677 --> 14:55.478
Yes, sir.

14:56.880 --> 14:58.180
Agent Lee.

14:58.248 --> 15:00.315
Lee, we have a situation.
I'm heading your way.

15:00.383 --> 15:02.284
A situation?
What are you talking about?

15:02.351 --> 15:03.785
Just gather the members
of your field team

15:03.853 --> 15:05.453
and hold them there
until I arrive.

15:05.521 --> 15:06.788
We're in the middle
of an operation here.

15:06.855 --> 15:08.022
What is this about?

15:08.090 --> 15:09.423
I'll fill you in
when I get there.

15:09.490 --> 15:11.858
Let's just say
you have a problem.

15:22.403 --> 15:24.336
I'm gonna get you
in the water next time we go.

15:24.404 --> 15:27.505
I like looking
at the water.

15:27.573 --> 15:28.706
I don't like
to get immersed.

15:28.774 --> 15:30.174
Yeah.

15:30.241 --> 15:34.443
So what do you say we--
we eat in tonight, huh?

15:34.511 --> 15:36.447
I'll pick up some fish
from the market.

15:36.514 --> 15:38.215
- Sound good?
- Yeah, sounds perfect.

15:38.282 --> 15:42.452
All right.

15:42.519 --> 15:45.156
Oh, hey, Mason, will you
pick up some sunflowers?

15:45.224 --> 15:47.524
Sunflowers?
What do you want sunflowers for?

15:47.592 --> 15:49.192
They light up the house.

15:49.259 --> 15:50.460
Okay.

15:50.527 --> 15:51.627
I'll light a fire.

15:51.695 --> 15:53.362
All right.

16:09.743 --> 16:11.043
What are you doing here?

16:11.111 --> 16:12.645
I think you know.

16:12.713 --> 16:15.714
Please, Thomas.

16:15.782 --> 16:17.515
I'm not ready.

16:17.583 --> 16:19.284
It's time to go now.

16:19.351 --> 16:21.552
I have a life here.

16:21.620 --> 16:23.554
Staying in one place any
longer than you already have

16:23.621 --> 16:27.724
is not an option
for any of us.

16:27.792 --> 16:29.458
How much longer
do you think it's gonna be

16:29.526 --> 16:33.061
before people start to notice
you're not getting any older?

16:33.129 --> 16:34.662
I don't know, okay?

16:34.730 --> 16:36.897
I'll figure out a way
to make it look like I am.

16:36.965 --> 16:38.432
I'm telling you
the way it's gonna be.

16:38.499 --> 16:39.733
Thom, come on.

16:39.801 --> 16:41.234
Please.
What's the problem?

16:41.302 --> 16:44.436
I fell in love.

16:46.472 --> 16:48.273
Now who in the hell
told you to do that?

16:48.341 --> 16:49.775
I had no control
over it, okay?

16:49.842 --> 16:52.043
It just--it just happened.

16:52.111 --> 16:54.712
And I'm not leaving her.

16:54.780 --> 16:57.314
If you don't go,

16:57.349 --> 16:58.882
she'll have to.

16:58.950 --> 17:01.918
It's my job to get us home.

17:01.986 --> 17:04.520
And I can't do that
without your help.

17:04.588 --> 17:07.723
Don't let your people down.

17:17.965 --> 17:19.700
Just let me
say good-bye, man.

17:19.768 --> 17:21.401
Just let me say good-bye.

17:21.469 --> 17:23.535
It's over.

17:23.603 --> 17:25.569
I'm sorry.

17:43.387 --> 17:44.554
Are all team members
present?

17:44.622 --> 17:46.722
I got them waiting
out front.

17:46.790 --> 17:48.556
I hope there's
a good reason for this.

17:48.624 --> 17:50.258
We have a traitor.

17:52.560 --> 17:53.827
What are you talking about?

17:53.895 --> 17:55.195
Someone took the scandium

17:55.262 --> 17:56.563
that was used
to dose the coffee shop

17:56.630 --> 17:57.563
from our armory.

17:57.631 --> 17:58.998
Are you sure?

17:59.066 --> 18:00.399
Positive.

18:00.467 --> 18:02.501
The only people with armory
access are the field teams.

18:02.569 --> 18:03.835
Whoever did it
should still be giving off

18:03.903 --> 18:05.203
trace levels of radiation.

18:05.271 --> 18:08.206
Well, I don't believe
one of my men would do this.

18:08.273 --> 18:09.773
But that is the case.

18:09.841 --> 18:11.975
- Now we need to scan them.
- Whoa, hold on.

18:14.045 --> 18:15.311
Let me do it.

18:15.379 --> 18:17.480
My men will take it better
if it's coming from me.

18:20.918 --> 18:22.985
All right.

18:26.323 --> 18:28.124
Agent Lee.

18:28.192 --> 18:30.193
Someone needs to check you.

18:37.034 --> 18:39.001
Are you questioning
my loyalty?

18:39.069 --> 18:42.403
Everyone on the team,
Sterling's orders.

18:42.471 --> 18:44.070
Let's just get it
out of the way.

19:33.681 --> 19:34.714
He was just trying
to mess with you.

19:34.782 --> 19:35.848
That's what these people do.

19:36.997 --> 19:38.263
What if what he said
is true?

19:38.331 --> 19:40.765
I mean, what if they chose
my father for a reason?

19:40.833 --> 19:42.867
Look, we have to go
to my parents' house

19:42.934 --> 19:45.869
and find something that
connects him to all of this.

19:45.936 --> 19:48.171
I don't think you're gonna
be able to find anything there.

19:48.239 --> 19:50.306
These people will make sure
that there's nothing to find.

19:50.374 --> 19:53.375
So then what are we
supposed to do?

19:53.443 --> 19:56.277
Well, Collier's called
her ex-husband.

19:56.345 --> 19:59.647
He's gonna lock that guy down
and get you someplace secure.

19:59.714 --> 20:00.948
Okay?

20:01.015 --> 20:02.682
What are you gonna do?

20:02.750 --> 20:06.753
There's a federal murder
warrant out on me.

20:06.820 --> 20:09.022
They think I killed Greg.

20:09.089 --> 20:10.557
Collier knows
that you didn't do that.

20:10.624 --> 20:11.891
She believes you.

20:11.959 --> 20:13.292
Yeah, but it's her word
against the evidence,

20:13.360 --> 20:15.327
which she says they made
look airtight.

20:15.395 --> 20:17.529
So I need to find the people
behind this

20:17.597 --> 20:20.564
so I can clear my name
and so I can find out

20:20.632 --> 20:22.232
about your father
and Samantha?

20:22.300 --> 20:25.468
And you, you're just
gonna stay safe

20:25.536 --> 20:27.303
and get help.

20:27.371 --> 20:29.471
You need some time to heal.

20:29.539 --> 20:31.006
I'm not gonna heal

20:31.074 --> 20:33.441
until I know
about my family.

20:33.509 --> 20:36.443
- I'm going.
- Leila, listen to me.

20:36.511 --> 20:37.978
You're the most important thing
in the world to me.

20:38.046 --> 20:39.346
I'm not gonna
put you at risk.

20:39.414 --> 20:41.081
I don't need to be
protected right now, okay?

20:41.148 --> 20:42.515
I need to do something.

20:42.583 --> 20:44.917
I'm not gonna let you just
put me in some place

20:44.985 --> 20:46.786
while you're out there
looking for my family.

20:46.853 --> 20:49.021
I'm just not gonna do that.

20:49.088 --> 20:52.090
I'm going.

20:53.592 --> 20:55.193
Where's the ambulance?

20:55.260 --> 20:56.994
I'm sorry, was somebody
supposed to call one?

20:57.062 --> 20:58.262
Where is it?

20:58.330 --> 21:00.797
I heard you call one.
Come on, check on it.

21:00.865 --> 21:03.065
You're just an expert at
making friends, now aren't you?

21:03.133 --> 21:04.567
Where is it?

21:04.634 --> 21:06.068
I don't know.

21:06.136 --> 21:08.303
Maybe they put murderers
at the bottom of the list.

22:42.250 --> 22:45.585
Don't look at it.
Let's go, let's go.

22:45.653 --> 22:48.388
Let's go.

22:48.456 --> 22:51.391
I'm so sorry.

22:56.228 --> 22:57.662
Where do you want to start?

22:57.730 --> 22:59.196
There's gotta be
something in his office

22:59.264 --> 23:02.066
that will help us.

23:07.272 --> 23:09.805
Come on, just look
through everything.

23:09.873 --> 23:12.307
Leila.

23:12.375 --> 23:13.641
There's gotta be
something here.

23:13.709 --> 23:16.077
All right, we'll find it.
We'll find it.

23:44.203 --> 23:47.071
Sam's baby clothes.

23:51.776 --> 23:54.510
I was the only one
who could put her to sleep.

24:02.852 --> 24:04.052
What?

24:04.119 --> 24:06.387
The attic.

24:06.455 --> 24:08.122
- What?
- The attic.

24:17.464 --> 24:20.299
Here.

24:39.783 --> 24:42.050
What is this stuff?

24:42.118 --> 24:45.320
I don't know.

24:56.763 --> 24:58.097
You shouldn't
have come here.

25:09.748 --> 25:10.615
What is it?

25:10.682 --> 25:12.849
Hey, my cover's blown.
Sterling's aide made me.

25:12.917 --> 25:14.284
Can't you take care
of them?

25:14.385 --> 25:15.819
He's out cold
in the trunk of his car.

25:15.886 --> 25:16.920
Why didn't you--

25:16.987 --> 25:18.988
I wasn't going
to kill him, Thomas.

25:19.056 --> 25:20.890
And it wouldn't
have mattered anyway.

25:20.957 --> 25:24.860
Dead or alive, it's over.

25:24.927 --> 25:27.229
Then it's time
to move on again.

25:39.006 --> 25:40.573
Hey.
What's up, Mike?

25:40.640 --> 25:41.674
Where you headed?

25:41.742 --> 25:43.342
I don't know,
home I guess.

25:43.410 --> 25:44.743
Oh, no, no, no.
No way.

25:44.811 --> 25:46.245
Come on,
we gotta celebrate, man.

25:46.313 --> 25:48.114
We made it through training.

25:48.181 --> 25:50.015
Well, this is true.

25:50.083 --> 25:51.817
Just can't believe
you actually requested

25:51.884 --> 25:53.584
to be stationed in Alaska.
What is that about?

25:53.652 --> 25:55.019
You know me, man.
I'm a snowbird.

25:55.087 --> 25:56.520
Always have been.
Mason?

25:56.588 --> 26:00.490
Mason?

26:00.558 --> 26:02.592
Simon, you okay?

26:02.660 --> 26:06.262
Mason.

26:06.329 --> 26:09.098
It's me.

26:09.165 --> 26:10.732
It's Violet.

26:13.470 --> 26:15.537
Whoa.

26:15.604 --> 26:18.371
How can it be?

26:18.438 --> 26:20.571
You haven't aged a day.

26:20.639 --> 26:23.572
Simon, do you know her?

26:23.640 --> 26:25.941
I, uh--

26:26.009 --> 26:28.276
I think she's--
I apologize.

26:28.344 --> 26:30.411
She suffers from Alzheimer's.

26:30.479 --> 26:32.146
She gets people and places
mixed up.

26:32.214 --> 26:34.882
Mason, it's me.

26:34.950 --> 26:36.283
It's me.
Ma'am.

26:42.156 --> 26:43.222
It's me.

26:43.289 --> 26:44.489
Ma'am,
you've got the wrong guy.

26:44.557 --> 26:46.625
No.

26:46.693 --> 26:48.694
Okay, hey.
Simon, come on.

26:50.997 --> 26:53.666
I'm sorry.

26:53.734 --> 26:56.169
You must have me confused
with someone else.

26:56.237 --> 26:58.238
No.

26:58.306 --> 27:00.707
Don't leave.

27:00.775 --> 27:02.776
Please.

27:17.990 --> 27:20.057
Give me a picture
of the center screen, please.

27:24.862 --> 27:25.996
When were these taken?

27:26.064 --> 27:27.530
Ten minutes ago.

27:27.598 --> 27:29.731
Redirect all teams
immediately.

27:29.799 --> 27:31.066
And pull up all
the adjacent cameras.

27:31.133 --> 27:32.367
Tell me you found her.

27:32.434 --> 27:34.368
Mr. President,
a traffic camera

27:34.436 --> 27:36.237
just spotted Sophia
heading east.

27:36.304 --> 27:37.638
It was on a time delay

27:37.706 --> 27:39.941
we don't have her yet,
but we're closing in.

27:43.377 --> 27:45.778
There you are.

27:52.451 --> 27:53.785
Target seen
entering a building

27:53.852 --> 27:56.254
0.7 miles east of
the Takoma playground.

27:56.321 --> 27:59.456
Copy that.
Alpha en route.

27:59.524 --> 28:01.592
Thomas,
they've spotted Sophia.

28:01.659 --> 28:03.026
She's gonna lead them
straight to you.

28:03.094 --> 28:04.394
How long until you get here?

28:04.462 --> 28:05.929
No, you can't wait.
You gotta get out of there now.

28:05.997 --> 28:07.431
Don't worry,
just get here.

28:07.498 --> 28:09.165
- I have a contingency plan.
- What are you talking about?

28:09.233 --> 28:10.333
What the hell are you--

28:10.400 --> 28:12.835
Thomas!
Damn it!

28:32.851 --> 28:35.187
We have a lot
to talk about.

28:38.292 --> 28:41.060
But for now,

28:41.128 --> 28:43.796
I'm happy to see you.

28:53.204 --> 28:56.539
I need to know how much of
your father's file you've seen.

28:56.607 --> 28:58.507
How much do you know?

28:58.575 --> 29:00.642
We don't know anything.
We just found it.

29:00.709 --> 29:03.410
Then it may not be too late.

29:03.478 --> 29:06.445
Put the file
on the floor, slowly,

29:06.513 --> 29:07.613
and slide it toward me.

29:07.680 --> 29:08.680
Okay.

29:08.748 --> 29:09.882
Do not move
or I will shoot you!

29:09.949 --> 29:10.883
Do you understand?

29:10.950 --> 29:12.784
My mother is dead.

29:12.852 --> 29:14.719
And my family is missing.

29:14.786 --> 29:19.222
What's in this file might have
something to do with it.

29:19.290 --> 29:21.024
We're not giving it to you.

29:21.092 --> 29:22.825
Don't--don't shoot.

29:22.893 --> 29:24.260
You can have the file, okay?
Sean.

29:24.327 --> 29:26.628
I'm not letting you
get shot.

29:26.696 --> 29:27.929
Okay?
You can have it.

29:31.767 --> 29:33.867
Here you go.

29:36.971 --> 29:38.872
Drop it.

29:38.939 --> 29:41.206
Drop it!

29:42.842 --> 29:45.743
All right, upstairs.

29:45.810 --> 29:48.444
Move!

29:48.512 --> 29:49.946
Who the hell are you?

29:50.013 --> 29:52.682
And don't lie to me.

29:52.749 --> 29:54.917
I don't lie.

29:54.985 --> 29:56.985
I don't lie.

29:57.053 --> 30:00.954
My name is Madeline Jackson.

30:01.022 --> 30:04.724
I'm a journalist.

30:04.792 --> 30:07.793
I used to be,
till I saw the light.

30:07.861 --> 30:10.995
That trying to speak the truth
is a waste of time

30:11.063 --> 30:12.596
because nobody
wants the truth.

30:12.664 --> 30:14.231
People don't want
the truth.

30:14.299 --> 30:16.401
God forbid it would all
go down in flames.

30:16.469 --> 30:18.904
It's the lies that keep
the construct going.

30:18.972 --> 30:20.240
Don't you see?

30:20.307 --> 30:22.375
Spread by the vested interests
in the government,

30:22.443 --> 30:24.711
and the private sector,
and the churches,

30:24.778 --> 30:26.979
and the stock exchanges,
all fabricating and spinning

30:27.047 --> 30:29.781
and telling stories that keep
300 million consumers

30:29.849 --> 30:32.684
happy and stupid and spending.

30:34.820 --> 30:37.988
Why are you looking at me
like I'm crazy?

30:38.056 --> 30:40.157
Just stop.

30:40.224 --> 30:41.624
I'm not the deluded ones.

30:41.692 --> 30:43.025
You are.

30:45.862 --> 30:47.763
Why are you here?

30:47.830 --> 30:49.298
And what does this have to do
with my father?

30:49.365 --> 30:51.266
Back to the beginning.

30:51.333 --> 30:53.634
Two years ago,

30:53.702 --> 30:56.470
your father contacted me
about a flight

30:56.538 --> 30:58.305
he was piloting
to Anchorage.

30:58.373 --> 31:02.308
Weather forced him to divert.

31:02.376 --> 31:04.143
And by accident
he saw that.

31:04.211 --> 31:05.978
It's in the file.

31:06.046 --> 31:09.347
It's an unlisted government
facility near Inostranka,

31:09.415 --> 31:10.748
middle of nowhere.

31:10.816 --> 31:13.984
He was curious,
and he read an article

31:14.052 --> 31:15.819
that I put on a site
that I had.

31:15.887 --> 31:17.888
That was before
they took away my site,

31:17.955 --> 31:19.823
that they hacked it
out of existence

31:19.890 --> 31:21.157
because they didn't want
anyone to know.

31:21.225 --> 31:23.559
- They who?
- The government?

31:23.626 --> 31:25.494
The government
are scared little children

31:25.561 --> 31:27.663
compared to the forces
that want this kept a secret.

31:27.730 --> 31:30.966
Do you understand?

31:31.034 --> 31:34.002
Your father knew too much.

31:34.070 --> 31:35.470
So they took him.

31:35.537 --> 31:37.472
Don't you see?

31:37.539 --> 31:39.674
No.

31:39.741 --> 31:41.642
No, I don't understand.

31:41.709 --> 31:44.644
Honestly, you seem
out of your mind.

31:44.712 --> 31:46.947
I am not out of my mind.
Listen to me.

31:47.014 --> 31:49.616
So why don't you just
tell us what her father knew?

31:49.683 --> 31:51.417
Okay?

31:51.485 --> 31:55.520
It's your funeral, okay?

31:55.588 --> 31:59.490
In 1944,
an aircraft crashed

31:59.558 --> 32:01.592
over the Brooks Range
in Alaska.

32:01.660 --> 32:04.028
The government imprisoned
the survivors

32:04.095 --> 32:06.496
in a facility they built
especially for them.

32:06.563 --> 32:09.832
Why?
What did they do?

32:11.468 --> 32:15.137
It's not what they did.
It's who they are.

32:15.204 --> 32:17.605
Who are they?

32:19.207 --> 32:20.207
E.B.E.S.

32:24.278 --> 32:27.680
Extraterrestrial
biological entities.

32:31.317 --> 32:32.918
Aliens.

32:40.642 --> 32:42.764
Four minutes ago,
we got visual of Sophia

32:42.864 --> 32:43.897
heading into this building.

32:43.964 --> 32:46.899
These were taken
at the same building

32:46.967 --> 32:49.235
two hours earlier.

32:49.302 --> 32:52.038
This is the best resolution
we've been able to get.

32:57.644 --> 33:01.579
That's him
right there, Thomas.

33:01.647 --> 33:03.447
I know it.

33:03.515 --> 33:04.848
Our field units
are en route.

33:04.916 --> 33:07.450
We'll have the building
surrounded within minutes.

33:27.466 --> 33:29.133
Thomas?

33:29.201 --> 33:30.835
Thomas?

33:35.706 --> 33:36.973
Target in sight.

33:37.041 --> 33:38.307
E.T.A., about two minutes.

33:38.374 --> 33:40.842
Damn it.

33:40.909 --> 33:42.442
Thomas?

33:54.316 --> 33:56.783
Thomas?

33:56.851 --> 33:58.517
Sophia?

34:30.516 --> 34:32.417
Thomas?

34:32.485 --> 34:35.018
Sophia?

34:35.087 --> 34:36.187
Thomas?

34:36.255 --> 34:39.589
Hey, Thomas, Sophia.

34:39.657 --> 34:40.757
They're right behind us,

34:40.824 --> 34:42.458
every field team
in the D.C. area.

34:42.525 --> 34:43.759
Don't worry.

34:43.827 --> 34:45.025
No, you don't understand.

34:45.094 --> 34:46.360
This place is gonna be
crawling with agents.

34:46.429 --> 34:47.896
It won't take them
any time at all to find that

34:47.963 --> 34:49.030
and come after you.

34:49.098 --> 34:51.831
I told you, don't worry.

35:09.014 --> 35:10.715
What have you done?

35:10.783 --> 35:12.817
We have to go now.

35:12.885 --> 35:14.652
Thomas, call it off.

35:14.719 --> 35:16.452
No, I can't.

35:16.520 --> 35:17.620
It's too late.

35:17.688 --> 35:18.788
This is it, Simon.

35:25.629 --> 35:27.697
Thomas.

35:27.764 --> 35:29.698
I promise you,
there's nothing I can do.

35:29.766 --> 35:31.733
We gotta go.

35:34.403 --> 35:36.071
Simon, you have
to come with us now.

35:36.138 --> 35:38.305
It's too late
for you to go back.

35:38.373 --> 35:40.374
You have to come
with us now.

35:40.442 --> 35:42.776
I'm sorry.

35:42.843 --> 35:44.010
Please.

35:44.078 --> 35:45.577
Simon, come.

36:22.074 --> 36:23.874
Mason.

36:29.513 --> 36:30.813
A sunflower.

36:36.551 --> 36:39.753
I know how much
you like them.

36:39.821 --> 36:42.121
How they used
to light up the house.

36:42.189 --> 36:46.858
Oh.

36:46.926 --> 36:49.327
Are you an angel?

36:50.763 --> 36:52.930
No.

36:52.998 --> 36:55.399
I am so far from that.

36:55.466 --> 36:59.235
But...

36:59.302 --> 37:01.236
You're here.

37:03.573 --> 37:05.440
I'm here.

37:05.508 --> 37:07.308
Oh.

37:07.376 --> 37:10.411
Oh.

37:10.479 --> 37:14.481
I'm so sorry.

37:14.549 --> 37:17.285
I'm so sorry
for everything.

37:17.352 --> 37:18.853
Please forgive me.

37:20.755 --> 37:23.223
I waited for you

37:23.291 --> 37:26.092
for so long.

37:26.160 --> 37:29.662
Did you love me?

37:35.668 --> 37:37.502
I never stopped
loving you.

37:37.570 --> 37:39.170
Oh.

37:39.238 --> 37:41.505
If it were up to me,

37:41.573 --> 37:44.241
we would have
gotten married.

37:44.308 --> 37:45.742
We would have had children.

37:45.810 --> 37:48.511
Oh.

37:48.578 --> 37:50.679
We would have
grown old together.

37:58.653 --> 38:01.655
It was up to you.

38:08.161 --> 38:12.196
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

38:12.264 --> 38:15.466
I'm so sorry.

38:18.436 --> 38:21.204
Simon.

38:21.271 --> 38:22.705
Please, come.

38:32.214 --> 38:33.448
This is Agent Lee.

38:33.516 --> 38:36.117
Evacuate the building now.
That's an order.

38:58.104 --> 38:59.538
Everybody out of here!

39:02.541 --> 39:06.176
Oh, God.
Oh, my God.

39:09.179 --> 39:11.079
Guys, get out of here!

39:11.147 --> 39:13.081
Get your men out of here.

39:16.285 --> 39:19.754
Oh, Jesus.
Oh, Jesus.

39:19.822 --> 39:20.822
Oh, God.

39:20.890 --> 39:22.357
Hold on a second.

39:22.424 --> 39:25.193
Hey! Anybody!

39:37.537 --> 39:39.404
I need help!

39:39.472 --> 39:42.506
Hold on, buddy.
Hold on.

39:42.574 --> 39:45.008
Anybody?
Mike, help me out here, man.

39:45.076 --> 39:47.877
Come on, we've got
to get him out of here.

39:47.945 --> 39:49.378
What the hell?

39:49.446 --> 39:51.647
Come on.
I need you, let's go.

39:51.715 --> 39:53.849
Come on.

39:53.916 --> 39:55.050
Hang on, buddy.

39:55.117 --> 39:56.150
Hang on.
We got you.

39:56.218 --> 39:58.085
Let's go, let's go.

40:01.823 --> 40:04.124
Look out!

40:04.191 --> 40:06.859
We've gotta go over it.
I got him.

40:12.298 --> 40:15.867
Got him?
Yeah.

40:15.935 --> 40:17.935
Let's go!

40:40.155 --> 40:42.289
Go, Mike, go!

40:42.357 --> 40:45.425
Go, I'll be
right behind you.

40:45.493 --> 40:47.494
Just go!

40:59.705 --> 41:01.873
Come on!
Move, move, move!

41:55.853 --> 41:57.854
Simon?

42:02.793 --> 42:04.794
Simon?

42:07.964 --> 42:09.831
Simon!
