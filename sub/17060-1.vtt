02:31.171 --> 02:32.805
- Give me two more.

02:34.107 --> 02:35.741
- Raise you two.

02:35.743 --> 02:37.376
- Oh, raise me two?

02:41.981 --> 02:44.783
Jacks and kings,
what do you got?

02:45.552 --> 02:46.952
Ah, it's all me.

02:50.390 --> 02:51.724
You suck at this game, man.

02:51.726 --> 02:53.359
- I know.

02:53.361 --> 02:57.596
- You needed to gamble more
when you were growing up.

03:23.256 --> 03:24.656
- I can't tell you
how excited we are

03:24.658 --> 03:26.558
that you chose our
institution to do research

03:26.560 --> 03:28.327
for your new book, Dr. Marcus.

03:28.329 --> 03:30.963
- Well that
pleases me to hear, Dr. Victor.

03:30.965 --> 03:32.965
- Please, call me Paul.

03:32.967 --> 03:34.700
May I call you Daniel?

03:34.702 --> 03:36.034
- Actually, no.

03:38.171 --> 03:42.040
I only let my friends
call me Daniel.

03:42.042 --> 03:44.209
Paul, have a seat please.

03:48.615 --> 03:50.048
Have you had a chance to...

03:50.050 --> 03:52.751
- oh, finished it last night.

03:52.753 --> 03:55.220
Very, very impressive
work, doctor.

03:55.222 --> 03:57.322
A riveting read.

03:57.324 --> 03:58.791
We're lucky to have you here.

03:58.793 --> 04:00.392
- Well thank you, that's
so nice of you to say.

04:00.394 --> 04:02.795
My only hope is that I
can make a difference

04:02.797 --> 04:05.364
in the lives of
your patients here.

04:05.366 --> 04:07.966
- I have no doubt that you will.

04:07.968 --> 04:09.435
Though I must say,

04:09.437 --> 04:11.170
you certainly have your
hands full with this group.

04:11.172 --> 04:13.705
I can assure you of that.

04:13.707 --> 04:16.875
Do you mind if I ask why these
patients stood out to you?

04:16.877 --> 04:18.243
- Not at all.

04:18.245 --> 04:19.812
The research I'm
going to be doing here

04:19.814 --> 04:21.413
is in support of a
new book of mine,

04:21.415 --> 04:23.115
which is going to be addressing

04:23.117 --> 04:26.051
the fundamental difference
between true mental illness

04:26.053 --> 04:29.188
and that of a created
psychosis brought on by

04:29.190 --> 04:32.391
a patient's need to
buffer the subconscious

04:32.393 --> 04:34.393
against some horrendous
or horrific act

04:34.395 --> 04:36.562
that's been occurred
upon them in the past.

04:36.564 --> 04:40.799
Or it could be hiding a much
more sinister, darker issue,

04:41.668 --> 04:42.668
which is,

04:43.670 --> 04:46.104
that they're lying.

04:46.106 --> 04:49.007
And they're hiding some heinous,

04:49.009 --> 04:52.878
horrible act in their past
that they're guilty of.

04:52.880 --> 04:54.346
- Well, in that case,

04:54.348 --> 04:56.181
you've picked the
cream of the crop.

04:56.183 --> 04:57.416
These patients suffer from

04:57.418 --> 04:59.117
a variety of mental
health issues,

04:59.119 --> 05:02.521
probably the most
severe I've ever seen.

05:02.523 --> 05:05.190
Everything from
paranoid schizophrenia,

05:05.192 --> 05:08.760
extreme phobias and
delusional disorders.

05:08.762 --> 05:12.397
Causing nearly all of them to
commit some terrible crime.

05:12.399 --> 05:14.266
- Which is why I chose them.

05:14.268 --> 05:15.334
Now, were they
informed that I was

05:15.336 --> 05:17.269
doing research on a new book?

05:17.271 --> 05:19.438
- Yeah, they've
certainly been told.

05:19.440 --> 05:21.807
Whether they remember or
not remains to be seen.

05:21.809 --> 05:23.942
- Well, I believe that...

05:23.944 --> 05:26.144
Being honest with a
patient is a way of

05:26.146 --> 05:28.046
unlocking their trust.

05:29.816 --> 05:30.883
- Of course.

05:31.951 --> 05:33.485
As requested, all the
patients have been

05:33.487 --> 05:35.554
moved into a joint holding area.

05:35.556 --> 05:38.357
And I've given specific
instructions to Kyle and Shane...

05:38.359 --> 05:40.859
- Kyle and Shane, they are?

05:40.861 --> 05:44.062
- They're the orderlies I've
assigned to assist you today.

05:44.064 --> 05:45.631
Kyle is my nephew.

05:46.733 --> 05:47.933
Not the brightest young man,

05:47.935 --> 05:49.601
but certainly
capable of escorting

05:49.603 --> 05:52.905
the patients in and
out of the office.

05:52.907 --> 05:55.941
Unfortunately, our operational
budget has been cut

05:55.943 --> 05:57.943
by the board of directors.

05:57.945 --> 05:59.511
Again.

05:59.513 --> 06:03.081
So we do what we can
with staffing these days.

06:03.083 --> 06:06.752
- Well, when this new book
comes out and it's a success,

06:06.754 --> 06:09.488
I will attribute your institution
with all the research

06:09.490 --> 06:10.689
and hopefully that'll buffer

06:10.691 --> 06:13.492
some of your costs
in the future.

06:15.295 --> 06:17.863
- I have faith that it will.

06:17.865 --> 06:20.198
And I do hope the
office we've provided

06:20.200 --> 06:22.367
for the interviews will suffice.

06:22.369 --> 06:24.202
Due to the severe nature
of mental illnesses

06:24.204 --> 06:25.504
of the patients you've selected,

06:25.506 --> 06:27.906
we have to keep them
under maximum security.

06:27.908 --> 06:31.510
- Well, I'm sure
it'll be just fine.

06:31.512 --> 06:33.312
- Well, if there's
anything else you need,

06:33.314 --> 06:35.213
just have one of the
orderlies come find me.

06:35.215 --> 06:36.415
I'll be on my afternoon rounds.

06:36.417 --> 06:38.317
- Thank you very much.

06:39.786 --> 06:41.753
- Enjoy the sessions, doctor.

06:41.755 --> 06:43.989
- Absolutely.

07:09.950 --> 07:12.484
- Dude, this place blows,
I don't get any service.

07:14.154 --> 07:15.520
- Dude, what the hell?

07:15.522 --> 07:16.888
- Gentlemen.

07:20.527 --> 07:21.994
- Yes?

07:21.996 --> 07:25.731
- Could you bring in
patient 110984, please?

07:28.034 --> 07:29.034
- Yes sir.

07:31.104 --> 07:33.939
- For the record,
patient 110984.

07:35.174 --> 07:36.875
Jill, 27 years old.

07:36.877 --> 07:40.579
She's been institutionalized
for over 17 years.

07:40.581 --> 07:41.913
The patient claims
her mother tried

07:41.915 --> 07:44.583
to murder her at the age of 10.

07:45.652 --> 07:48.854
Patient has been
exhibiting behavior

07:48.856 --> 07:51.890
not unlike anorexia or
bulimia for the past 11 days

07:51.892 --> 07:55.627
and has refused water
for the past 48 hours.

08:20.820 --> 08:23.488
Okay, thank you, that'll be all.

08:23.490 --> 08:25.090
- Dr. Marcus, I don't
think I'm supposed to...

08:25.092 --> 08:29.127
- and this is the order I'd
like to see the patients in.

08:29.129 --> 08:30.328
Your name is?

08:30.330 --> 08:31.797
- Kyle.

08:31.799 --> 08:32.931
- Kyle.

08:32.933 --> 08:35.500
Thank you Kyle, we'll be fine.

08:49.916 --> 08:50.916
Hello Jill.

08:52.552 --> 08:54.720
My name's Dr. Marcus.

08:54.722 --> 08:56.955
- What do you want?

08:56.957 --> 08:58.957
- I'd like to help you.

09:00.827 --> 09:03.562
- Why are you recording me?

09:03.564 --> 09:07.799
- Oh well, that's so that
you can help me help you.

09:08.768 --> 09:09.835
- Uncuff me.

09:10.970 --> 09:13.271
- Well, I'm afraid I
don't have the key.

09:13.273 --> 09:15.006
- That's bullshit.

09:15.008 --> 09:18.577
- Why do you want to be
out of your restraints?

09:18.579 --> 09:19.778
Hmm?

09:19.780 --> 09:21.279
Is it so that you
can pull out your iv,

09:21.281 --> 09:22.948
continue hurting yourself?

09:22.950 --> 09:25.183
Is that what you wanna do?

09:26.819 --> 09:30.455
- I'd rather be dead
than be here any more.

09:31.891 --> 09:32.891
- Really?

09:36.729 --> 09:37.729
Hmm.

09:43.169 --> 09:46.104
I have something
I'd like to try.

09:48.008 --> 09:51.209
I can make this very
quick, very quick.

09:51.211 --> 09:52.744
I can say that

09:52.746 --> 09:55.814
you lunged at me after I let
you out of your restraints.

09:55.816 --> 09:57.883
And I had to defend myself.

09:57.885 --> 09:59.985
And you know what,
here's the best part.

09:59.987 --> 10:01.720
Nobody's going to give a damn.

10:01.722 --> 10:03.822
So you just sit
there nice and calm

10:03.824 --> 10:06.625
and it'll be over in a second.

10:21.007 --> 10:22.407
- Are you crazy?

10:24.977 --> 10:27.412
Why would you do that?

10:27.414 --> 10:30.949
- Well, I did just prove
that you don't wanna die.

10:30.951 --> 10:33.685
- I don't wanna be here anymore!

10:34.887 --> 10:35.887
- Well.

10:38.791 --> 10:40.992
Maybe I can help you with that.

10:40.994 --> 10:42.427
Tell me what happened.

10:42.429 --> 10:43.695
Tell me what happened
with your mother,

10:43.697 --> 10:45.096
with your mommy.

10:49.702 --> 10:52.237
- She was trying to kill me.

10:52.239 --> 10:53.239
- How?

10:54.240 --> 10:55.774
- You already know
what happened,

10:55.776 --> 10:57.742
you have everything right
there in those folders.

10:57.744 --> 10:59.010
- All right.

10:59.012 --> 11:00.545
Look, I could send
you back with a

11:00.547 --> 11:02.447
recommendation for
electro-shock therapy.

11:02.449 --> 11:05.383
Young lady if you think
your stay here has been,

11:05.385 --> 11:06.385
trying,

11:07.420 --> 11:11.122
believe me, it can get
a hell of a lot worse.

11:12.058 --> 11:13.725
- What do you want from me?

11:13.727 --> 11:15.126
- I want the truth.

11:15.128 --> 11:17.963
Not what's in the
files, I want...

11:17.965 --> 11:20.498
I want what you remember.

11:20.500 --> 11:22.667
- Will you help me?

11:22.669 --> 11:23.735
- I can try.

11:24.937 --> 11:27.239
But first you're gonna have to

11:27.241 --> 11:29.107
open up, be honest with
me, tell me the truth.

11:29.109 --> 11:31.676
And I will know if you're not.

11:42.990 --> 11:44.055
This is going nowhere.

11:44.057 --> 11:45.891
- They say I'm crazy!

11:48.995 --> 11:50.061
But I'm not.

11:54.934 --> 11:56.234
- All right.

11:56.236 --> 11:57.236
Why?

12:02.141 --> 12:03.642
- I loved my mom.

12:05.645 --> 12:07.312
She was a good mom.

12:08.781 --> 12:09.781
Until...

12:15.354 --> 12:17.756
Until she started seeing it.

12:22.161 --> 12:23.161
- It?

12:27.133 --> 12:28.133
Seeing it?

12:38.844 --> 12:39.844
- Honey.

12:42.549 --> 12:44.516
Why are you in the bed?

12:46.185 --> 12:47.185
Jill!

12:47.954 --> 12:49.688
Did you wet the bed?

12:51.390 --> 12:52.390
Oh god.

12:57.964 --> 12:59.097
Oh my god!

12:59.099 --> 13:01.232
Oh my god, honey, what happened?

13:01.234 --> 13:02.434
What happened Jill?

13:02.436 --> 13:03.535
Was there somebody here?

13:03.537 --> 13:04.537
Talk to me!

13:06.139 --> 13:07.139
Katie!

14:25.718 --> 14:26.718
Oh my god.

14:28.387 --> 14:29.387
Katie.

14:30.856 --> 14:32.323
Katie.

14:32.325 --> 14:33.325
Katie.

15:19.705 --> 15:20.705
- Mom.

15:51.837 --> 15:52.971
- Mom?

15:54.107 --> 15:56.508
What are you doing?

15:56.510 --> 15:57.510
- Huh?

15:59.044 --> 16:01.646
- What happened to the hallway?

16:09.289 --> 16:10.289
Oh no!

16:12.291 --> 16:14.692
You're doing it again!

16:19.098 --> 16:20.565
- Open up!

16:20.567 --> 16:21.799
Open the door!

16:24.737 --> 16:27.872
It's your mother, open the door!

16:27.874 --> 16:29.374
Open the door!

16:29.376 --> 16:30.642
Now!

16:30.644 --> 16:32.610
Put your hand on the
door and unlock it!

16:32.612 --> 16:34.112
It's your mother!

16:36.015 --> 16:37.582
Please, let me in!

17:05.845 --> 17:06.845
Oh god, oh!

17:08.580 --> 17:11.482
Get outta there,
you're in danger!

17:17.589 --> 17:18.957
My baby.

17:18.959 --> 17:19.959
Oh my baby.

17:32.204 --> 17:35.873
- Why did you kill
somebody you claim to love?

17:35.875 --> 17:37.442
- I had no choice.

17:38.811 --> 17:41.079
- Did you hate your mother?

17:41.081 --> 17:43.648
- That's a messed up question.

17:49.355 --> 17:52.857
- Which only you know
the answer to, hmm?

17:54.426 --> 17:56.761
- I wanna go back to my cell.

17:56.763 --> 17:59.364
- Where was your
father during all this?

17:59.366 --> 18:00.366
Hmm?

18:03.736 --> 18:06.137
- He wasn't there, he was...

18:08.307 --> 18:10.908
He was out with my sister Katie.

18:10.910 --> 18:11.910
- Ah.

18:13.212 --> 18:17.348
Did you ever wonder who
the real monster here is?

18:19.985 --> 18:23.254
You want everyone to
think of you as this poor,

18:23.256 --> 18:25.990
helpless victim,
who had no choice.

18:25.992 --> 18:27.058
- Screw you!

18:28.227 --> 18:29.527
- When in fact,

18:30.329 --> 18:32.897
you're actually a cold-blooded

18:34.133 --> 18:35.133
sociopathic

18:36.635 --> 18:38.136
killer.

18:38.138 --> 18:40.505
With an Electra complex
who wanted mommy

18:40.507 --> 18:43.841
out of the way so she could
have daddy all to herself.

18:43.843 --> 18:45.143
Isn't that right?

18:45.145 --> 18:46.611
- No!

18:46.613 --> 18:48.279
- Were you eventually going
to kill your sister too?

18:48.281 --> 18:49.113
- No!
- - Were you?

18:49.115 --> 18:51.115
- You know nothing!

18:52.552 --> 18:53.552
Help!

18:56.922 --> 18:58.156
- Hey hey hey.

18:59.158 --> 19:00.224
Okay, breathe.

19:00.226 --> 19:01.826
Breathe, calm down.

19:02.961 --> 19:05.196
Shane, I need backup, now.

19:06.432 --> 19:07.965
- I hate you!

19:07.967 --> 19:09.033
You're evil!

19:16.809 --> 19:18.376
Get me outta here!

19:19.845 --> 19:21.079
Who are you?

19:21.081 --> 19:22.914
Who the hell are you?

19:25.117 --> 19:27.251
- Gentlemen, when
you get a chance,

19:27.253 --> 19:28.252
bring in patient

19:30.123 --> 19:31.123
78.

19:44.703 --> 19:47.638
John Doe, estimated
to be in his late 50s,

19:47.640 --> 19:48.940
was found wandering in the woods

19:48.942 --> 19:50.875
wearing nothing more
than a bathrobe.

19:50.877 --> 19:54.412
John Doe, or JD as
they call him here,

19:54.414 --> 19:58.883
claims to have no
recollection of who he is.

19:58.885 --> 20:01.986
- At least this one won't
give us any problems, huh?

20:01.988 --> 20:05.056
- Yeah, he's the
shy, quiet type.

20:05.058 --> 20:07.392
Isn't that right, JD?

20:07.394 --> 20:08.860
- He has no known family

20:08.862 --> 20:10.461
and authorities were
unable to establish

20:10.463 --> 20:13.264
his identity through
fingerprints or dental records.

20:13.266 --> 20:16.067
He was admitted to this facility

20:16.069 --> 20:17.602
five years ago.

20:17.604 --> 20:19.070
After several violent encounters

20:19.072 --> 20:23.307
due to a recurring nightmare
and an unexplainable fear of...

20:24.176 --> 20:25.309
Plastic wrap.

20:27.012 --> 20:28.012
Hmm.

20:42.127 --> 20:44.028
This patient's loaded.

20:45.097 --> 20:48.166
JD here stays baked 24/7.

20:53.005 --> 20:54.906
- Wonderful, okay,
get him outta here.

20:54.908 --> 20:58.342
Bring him back when
he's more coherent, hmm?

20:58.344 --> 21:00.178
- We can't do that, sir.

21:00.180 --> 21:02.113
That's Dr. Victor's orders.

21:02.115 --> 21:03.314
- This patient is violent.

21:03.316 --> 21:05.616
- I'm right here, you know?

21:06.485 --> 21:07.552
- All right.

21:11.957 --> 21:13.224
What's your name?

21:13.226 --> 21:14.592
- JD.

21:14.594 --> 21:16.928
- JD, do you know which,

21:16.930 --> 21:18.763
which city you're in?

21:20.098 --> 21:21.432
- They won't tell me.

21:24.770 --> 21:26.037
That was wonderful.

21:26.039 --> 21:27.305
All right, all right,
go on, get outta here.

21:27.307 --> 21:28.139
Leave him here.

21:28.141 --> 21:29.307
Go on, go on.

21:32.044 --> 21:34.445
Get the door on the way out.

21:39.218 --> 21:41.619
All right JD, I am...

21:41.621 --> 21:43.321
Dr. Marcus.

21:43.323 --> 21:45.356
- What are you doing?

21:45.358 --> 21:46.457
- I'm recording you.

21:46.459 --> 21:48.626
You have a problem with that?

21:48.628 --> 21:50.595
- Like I have a choice?

22:00.906 --> 22:03.074
Can you, can you put
that away please?

22:03.076 --> 22:04.076
Please?

22:04.877 --> 22:06.711
- Is there a problem?

22:23.061 --> 22:26.130
Oh my god, the
charts are right on.

22:26.132 --> 22:29.534
You do have a problem
with plastic wrap.

22:31.436 --> 22:34.071
- Can you put that away,

22:34.073 --> 22:35.073
please?

22:37.543 --> 22:38.543
- Mmm.

22:42.981 --> 22:44.148
Here.

22:49.354 --> 22:52.089
All right, all right,
look look look.

22:52.091 --> 22:53.457
I'm wrapping it up.

22:53.459 --> 22:54.859
Putting it away.

22:58.131 --> 22:59.630
- Thank you.

22:59.632 --> 23:00.632
Thank you.

23:02.234 --> 23:04.201
- All right JD, you are,

23:04.203 --> 23:06.203
in spring valley
mental institution.

23:06.205 --> 23:09.874
Do you remember
being brought here?

23:09.876 --> 23:12.443
- I only remember one thing.

23:12.445 --> 23:13.411
- Ah good, what?

23:13.413 --> 23:15.012
- Why should I tell you?

23:15.014 --> 23:16.014
- Hmm.

23:16.848 --> 23:19.350
Well, if I'm gonna help you,

23:19.352 --> 23:21.786
I have to know what
makes you tick.

23:23.890 --> 23:25.856
- No no.
- - Yes.

23:27.894 --> 23:28.894
No, no!

23:39.705 --> 23:40.705
Please!

23:41.473 --> 23:42.807
No no no no no!

23:45.043 --> 23:47.411
Get it off me, get
it off me, please!

23:47.413 --> 23:50.414
Take it off, take
it off, take it off!

23:50.416 --> 23:53.517
- Not until you tell me
what it is I want to know.

23:53.519 --> 23:54.485
- Help!

23:54.487 --> 23:57.622
Help me, somebody, please help!

23:57.624 --> 24:00.625
Help, someone please help me!

24:00.627 --> 24:02.259
Help me!

24:02.261 --> 24:03.261
- Out!

24:04.129 --> 24:05.129
Right now.

24:08.467 --> 24:10.368
- Please, take it off!

24:21.113 --> 24:23.414
- Are you gonna
play ball with me?

24:23.416 --> 24:25.983
You gonna give me what I need?

24:35.227 --> 24:36.227
Now.

24:37.529 --> 24:38.529
JD.

24:40.198 --> 24:42.833
So you don't
remember who you are,

24:42.835 --> 24:44.535
where you come from?

24:44.537 --> 24:47.171
Why don't we start with this...

24:48.306 --> 24:51.942
Little problem you have
with plastic wrap, hmm?

24:55.213 --> 24:57.181
- I was on vacation.

24:57.183 --> 24:58.183
In the UK.

25:00.152 --> 25:01.619
And he killed me.

25:02.654 --> 25:03.654
- He what?

25:05.257 --> 25:06.557
- He killed me!

25:09.094 --> 25:10.094
- Who?

25:10.796 --> 25:13.330
- I don't know who he was.

25:13.332 --> 25:14.832
Or why he did it.

25:16.635 --> 25:18.269
But.

25:18.271 --> 25:19.437
In the dream,

25:20.939 --> 25:21.939
I could see

25:23.675 --> 25:24.675
and feel

25:26.044 --> 25:27.044
and hear

25:28.547 --> 25:29.547
everything!

28:06.004 --> 28:08.072
- Trick or treat!

28:10.742 --> 28:11.742
- Fuck off.

28:14.046 --> 28:15.246
- Excuse me!

28:15.248 --> 28:19.049
Oi, that's no bloody
way to talk to children!

28:21.052 --> 28:23.053
- Audi's in the garage.

28:28.760 --> 28:29.894
Now fuck off!

28:50.415 --> 28:52.449
- Evening, ladies.

28:52.451 --> 28:54.018
- How's it going?

28:54.020 --> 28:56.420
- Werewolf is mine, marry me!

28:56.422 --> 28:57.922
- Marry me!

29:11.903 --> 29:14.171
Oh shit mate, look at this!

29:14.173 --> 29:16.740
- Mate, what are you draggin'?

29:41.633 --> 29:43.233
- Hey!

29:43.235 --> 29:44.768
Excuse me, aren't you?

29:44.770 --> 29:48.439
Sorry, didn't you go
to Truman prep school?

29:49.574 --> 29:50.407
- No.

29:50.409 --> 29:52.176
- You did, didn't you?

29:52.178 --> 29:53.344
You did.

29:53.346 --> 29:54.346
1997.

29:55.246 --> 29:56.246
I'm Alan.

29:56.248 --> 29:57.414
Alan Fletcher?

29:57.416 --> 30:00.417
I was a prefect
while you were there.

30:05.123 --> 30:07.157
I haven't seen you since then.

30:07.159 --> 30:08.525
You never really did fit in.

30:08.527 --> 30:10.427
How are you anyway?

30:10.429 --> 30:13.731
That's a brilliant
costume, by the way.

30:13.733 --> 30:16.133
That's just genius.

30:16.135 --> 30:17.301
Terry?

30:17.303 --> 30:20.170
Come look at this,
look at all that blood!

30:20.172 --> 30:23.307
- Ah, that is an
amazing costume, mate!

30:23.309 --> 30:25.442
You're meant to be a
killer or something, right?

30:25.444 --> 30:27.311
- I am a killer, yes.

30:27.313 --> 30:29.079
- And that's the
body in the bag, is it?

30:29.081 --> 30:30.614
Latest victim type of thing?

30:30.616 --> 30:32.282
- Brand new.
- - Hah, brilliant!

30:32.284 --> 30:33.417
Fucking brilliant!

30:39.491 --> 30:41.091
Mate.

30:41.093 --> 30:42.559
It's bloody heavy.

30:42.561 --> 30:45.129
Can we give you a hand or two?

30:47.565 --> 30:48.565
Christ!

30:49.868 --> 30:51.168
You take your Halloween
shit seriously, don't you?

30:51.170 --> 30:53.570
You got an actual body
in there or something?

30:53.572 --> 30:55.205
Help him, dickhead.

30:57.208 --> 30:58.442
It's so heavy.

30:59.944 --> 31:02.780
Anyway, what's on
the agenda tonight?

31:02.782 --> 31:04.248
Have you been to a party?

31:04.250 --> 31:05.716
- No.

31:05.718 --> 31:07.651
- Listen, we're heading to
this pretty sweet loft party,

31:07.653 --> 31:08.886
just down the road here.

31:08.888 --> 31:10.354
I mean, our costumes
are a bit last minute,

31:10.356 --> 31:13.424
but yours, we would really make
an entrance with this thing.

31:13.426 --> 31:15.292
I know it's late, but you
will pop in for just one,

31:15.294 --> 31:16.560
won't you?

31:16.562 --> 31:18.395
Our pal Jack, I mean,
he's got to see this.

31:18.397 --> 31:22.199
He's so into his horror
shit, he's gonna love it!

31:22.201 --> 31:24.168
- I'd rather not
get sidetracked.

31:24.170 --> 31:25.102
- Mate, mate,

31:25.104 --> 31:26.637
don't be so bloody boring.

31:26.639 --> 31:28.539
Please, just one drink.

31:28.541 --> 31:29.973
It'll be really, really quick,

31:29.975 --> 31:31.895
you'll be back on the
streets killing in no time.

31:35.146 --> 31:36.747
- I shan't stay long.

31:36.749 --> 31:38.048
- Yes!

31:38.050 --> 31:39.950
This way then, killer!

31:41.386 --> 31:43.487
- You know Terry, I
think that's racist.

31:43.489 --> 31:44.721
- How's that racist?

31:44.723 --> 31:46.290
- It's just my mom's
cleaner's black,

31:46.292 --> 31:48.025
so I know about this stuff.

31:48.027 --> 31:51.028
- Yeah, well your mom's racist.

31:51.030 --> 31:52.996
- She is a bit racist.

32:18.423 --> 32:20.157
Wait wait, stay there,
I'm gonna go find Jack,

32:20.159 --> 32:22.059
don't move, all right?

32:27.532 --> 32:28.999
Yes!

32:32.104 --> 32:36.106
Listen, listen, you have
to come and see this.

32:36.108 --> 32:37.174
His costume.

32:38.343 --> 32:39.343
Look at it!

32:43.215 --> 32:45.949
- Now that is a
fuckin' costume, mate!

32:45.951 --> 32:47.417
- Nice face paint.

32:47.419 --> 32:48.318
Let me guess,

32:48.320 --> 32:49.720
American psycho?

32:51.055 --> 32:53.757
Hey Babs, pour us a round
of the reagent, man!

32:53.759 --> 32:57.928
I wanna do a shot with the
best costume in the house!

32:57.930 --> 32:58.930
Fuck me!

32:59.931 --> 33:02.032
Are you responsible for this?

33:02.034 --> 33:03.634
- Of course.

33:03.636 --> 33:05.502
- The detail, man!

33:05.504 --> 33:08.172
I can just about make out
that nasty wound, and...

33:08.174 --> 33:10.507
Oh, the blood is perfect!

33:11.877 --> 33:14.411
You've got some serious
talent right here!

33:14.413 --> 33:15.413
Ah-hah!

33:16.481 --> 33:17.748
Guys,

33:17.750 --> 33:18.750
grab one.

33:19.584 --> 33:20.584
A toast.

33:22.187 --> 33:24.454
To our new-found friend.

33:24.456 --> 33:27.591
Finally, someone who
appreciates Halloween

33:27.593 --> 33:28.992
as much as I do!

33:34.300 --> 33:35.766
Let's raise hell!

33:53.284 --> 33:54.751
- TNT, please.

33:54.753 --> 33:55.819
- Coming up.

34:10.735 --> 34:11.735
- Now that

34:12.704 --> 34:15.438
is a brilliant costume
you came up with.

34:15.440 --> 34:17.274
Wine please.

34:17.275 --> 34:18.275
- Hmm?

34:19.409 --> 34:21.043
Oh.

34:21.045 --> 34:23.246
Well it's not really a costume.

34:23.248 --> 34:24.614
- Right.

34:24.617 --> 34:26.016
You're right, sorry.

34:26.018 --> 34:28.918
More of a prop, isn't it?

34:28.920 --> 34:30.821
And the suit is great.

34:30.822 --> 34:34.725
Sort of a mental James
bond sort of thing.

34:34.726 --> 34:35.726
I'm Maggie.

34:36.761 --> 34:38.061
- Hello Maggie.

34:41.934 --> 34:43.533
It is just brilliant.

34:43.534 --> 34:44.735
I mean,

34:44.737 --> 34:48.272
how long did it take
you to stuff that thing?

34:48.274 --> 34:50.007
- Well it's more
of a roll, really.

34:50.009 --> 34:52.074
Like a pig in a blanket.

34:53.411 --> 34:55.344
- Well it is just brilliant.

34:55.347 --> 34:57.814
Just never seen
anything like it before.

34:57.816 --> 35:00.117
Not that well done, anyway.

35:01.219 --> 35:03.053
- I'm sure there
are plenty of us.

35:03.055 --> 35:04.655
Best night of the year for it.

35:04.657 --> 35:05.989
It's much harder to
go walking around

35:05.991 --> 35:07.658
with a dead body on
a regular evening

35:07.660 --> 35:09.793
than it is on Halloween.

35:13.331 --> 35:15.565
But we manage nonetheless.

35:16.701 --> 35:19.636
Just have to know
what you're doing.

35:19.638 --> 35:20.704
- Of course.

35:23.074 --> 35:24.675
Cheers!

35:24.677 --> 35:25.677
- Cheers.

35:27.578 --> 35:28.745
- All right all you ghouls

35:28.747 --> 35:30.180
and all you monsters out there,

35:30.182 --> 35:31.515
hope you're enjoying
yourselves so far tonight.

35:31.517 --> 35:33.450
Spooky, spooky night.

35:33.452 --> 35:34.685
Look guys, I'm really sorry,

35:34.687 --> 35:36.553
but we've just got
10 minutes left

35:36.555 --> 35:38.388
behind the bar tonight,
just ten minutes left.

35:41.593 --> 35:42.726
- Well I must be going now.

35:42.728 --> 35:44.194
- What, no!

35:44.196 --> 35:45.629
You can't go, it's Halloween!

35:45.631 --> 35:47.130
Jack will be having
an after party.

35:47.132 --> 35:48.332
Jack!

35:48.334 --> 35:50.100
You're having an
after party, right?

35:50.102 --> 35:51.102
- Mmm.

35:52.870 --> 35:54.604
Yeah, yeah sure!

35:54.606 --> 35:57.174
A few of you can come back
to mine for a night cap.

35:57.176 --> 35:58.108
- Brilliant.

35:58.110 --> 35:59.776
- No, really, I must be going.

35:59.778 --> 36:01.011
- Why?

36:01.013 --> 36:02.612
You haven't got work in
the morning, have you?

36:02.614 --> 36:03.980
- I've got work right now,

36:03.982 --> 36:06.149
I need to bury that
thing before 3 am

36:06.151 --> 36:07.818
or I don't get the bounty!

36:07.820 --> 36:08.819
- The bounty!

36:08.821 --> 36:10.053
Oooh, a prize!

36:11.155 --> 36:13.290
Like a Halloween scavenger hunt?

36:13.292 --> 36:14.958
That's what you meant
earlier when you said

36:14.960 --> 36:16.193
there's plenty of us doing it!

36:16.195 --> 36:18.362
OMG, I'm so thick!

36:18.364 --> 36:19.996
Well we can help you.

36:19.998 --> 36:22.566
It sounds like so much fun!

36:22.568 --> 36:23.400
- I don't...

36:23.402 --> 36:24.234
- come on guys!

36:24.236 --> 36:25.068
We've gotta do this!

36:25.070 --> 36:26.303
- Mate!

36:26.305 --> 36:27.270
Of course we'll help
you bury the body!

36:27.272 --> 36:29.039
And get the fuckin' prize!

36:29.041 --> 36:31.274
The least we can do, mate.

36:32.076 --> 36:33.543
- To the woods!

36:46.090 --> 36:47.324
Right in here.

36:53.898 --> 36:55.665
Start her up, my friend!

36:55.667 --> 36:56.667
Come on!

37:17.088 --> 37:18.388
- This will do.

37:20.658 --> 37:21.658
Stay here.

37:32.537 --> 37:33.770
- Where are we?

37:33.772 --> 37:36.306
We were driving
for over an hour.

37:38.676 --> 37:40.143
- Perfect!

37:52.790 --> 37:54.024
- Right gents.

37:54.026 --> 37:55.992
Follow the trail and
you'll spot a bonfire,

37:55.994 --> 37:59.963
get it lit, drop him in
the hole and cover him.

38:01.265 --> 38:05.335
I'll come and join you
shortly to finish things up.

38:16.581 --> 38:18.148
- Ah, dick!

38:19.817 --> 38:20.917
Dick!

38:25.590 --> 38:27.290
- All good?

38:27.292 --> 38:28.892
- Yeah.

38:28.894 --> 38:30.126
Yeah.

38:30.128 --> 38:33.930
Feel the weight on
this little bugger.

38:33.932 --> 38:35.532
- Wow.

38:35.534 --> 38:38.835
Yeah, that's really
got some clout to it.

38:38.837 --> 38:39.970
There you go.

39:15.573 --> 39:17.507
- What the fuck?

39:17.509 --> 39:19.342
What the actual fuck?

39:32.290 --> 39:33.290
- Alan.

39:34.292 --> 39:35.692
- Keep back.

39:35.694 --> 39:36.993
Keep back!

39:36.995 --> 39:37.894
- Alan!

39:37.896 --> 39:41.164
- Fuck!

39:48.639 --> 39:50.307
No, please!

39:50.309 --> 39:51.309
Please, no!

39:52.076 --> 39:54.911
Please!

40:04.822 --> 40:06.222
- All done here.

40:07.191 --> 40:08.491
So.

40:08.493 --> 40:09.492
Maggie.

40:09.494 --> 40:12.062
What do you fancy doing?

40:12.064 --> 40:14.197
- Did you get your prize?

40:15.433 --> 40:16.666
- So to speak.

40:17.935 --> 40:20.904
Do you fancy coming
back to mine for a bit?

40:20.906 --> 40:23.340
- Only if you're sure.

40:23.342 --> 40:26.409
I wouldn't wanna keep
you up any longer.

40:26.411 --> 40:30.080
- I'm sure I've got
one more in me tonight.

40:37.555 --> 40:39.155
Is there a problem, officer?

40:39.157 --> 40:40.523
- Trouble with the Van?

40:40.525 --> 40:42.726
- No, we're fine.

40:42.728 --> 40:44.728
We literally just
headed out here to

40:44.730 --> 40:47.197
get away from the city
lights for a while.

40:47.199 --> 40:48.465
We're just heading home now,

40:48.467 --> 40:50.467
had a bit of a mad one.

40:52.203 --> 40:53.403
- I see.

40:53.405 --> 40:54.671
Yeah, well make sure you do.

40:54.673 --> 40:56.339
We've got lots of nasty
reports this evening,

40:56.341 --> 40:58.041
don't want any more.

40:58.043 --> 40:59.342
You two be on your way.

40:59.344 --> 41:01.745
And you, make sure she
gets home all right.

41:01.747 --> 41:03.780
- Absolutely, officer.

41:03.782 --> 41:05.015
Take care now!

41:05.916 --> 41:06.916
Prick.

41:23.401 --> 41:24.701
- Did they fall for it?

41:24.703 --> 41:25.669
- Yeah mate,

41:25.671 --> 41:27.671
fuckin' hook, line and sinker!

41:27.673 --> 41:29.472
Some bloke knobbing his bird.

41:29.474 --> 41:31.408
Fair play to him actually,
she was quite fit, you know?

41:31.410 --> 41:33.643
- Oh man!

41:33.645 --> 41:35.378
This is so much
better than last year

41:35.380 --> 41:36.946
when we dressed up as priests!

41:36.948 --> 41:38.782
- I fucking love Halloween!

41:46.090 --> 41:47.557
- So let me get this straight.

41:47.559 --> 41:51.261
You have this
recurring nightmare...

41:51.263 --> 41:53.163
Where you're murdered,

41:54.031 --> 41:55.965
wrapped in this plastic,

41:55.967 --> 41:58.968
carted all over town
and yet you could see,

41:58.970 --> 42:02.038
feel and hear absolutely
everything that was going on?

42:02.040 --> 42:03.673
- Yes.

42:03.675 --> 42:06.476
- That's absolutely amazing.

42:06.478 --> 42:08.478
You know what I think?

42:08.480 --> 42:10.847
I think you're a lying,

42:10.849 --> 42:13.483
manipulative miscreant.

42:13.485 --> 42:15.318
Who's given up on life
and decided to live

42:15.320 --> 42:17.454
in this institution where
you can get three squares

42:17.456 --> 42:19.756
and a free bed every night.

42:21.392 --> 42:24.327
You are a pathetic
waste of human life,

42:24.329 --> 42:26.062
and I'm going to make
sure that you live

42:26.064 --> 42:28.798
in this self-made
nightmare of yours

42:28.800 --> 42:31.034
for the rest of your life.

42:32.236 --> 42:33.369
- No, no, no!

42:39.076 --> 42:40.710
- Don't touch that.

42:40.712 --> 42:44.914
I want the patient to
remain wrapped in plastic.

42:44.916 --> 42:46.649
Doctor's orders.

42:57.428 --> 42:59.496
Now get him out of here.

43:03.234 --> 43:05.301
Bring in patient 100174.

43:13.978 --> 43:16.379
Born in Reykjav勛, Iceland.

43:16.381 --> 43:19.916
Gabrielle fled to the
United States in the hope of

43:19.918 --> 43:22.185
avoiding prosecution for
the murder of a woman

43:22.187 --> 43:26.890
she believed her American fiance
was having an affair with.

43:28.393 --> 43:29.592
Upon her capture,

43:29.594 --> 43:31.494
her fiance's attorney
struck a plea deal

43:31.496 --> 43:33.830
with Icelandic authorities
to keep her stateside,

43:33.832 --> 43:35.064
with the condition that she stay

43:35.066 --> 43:38.802
in a maximum security
psychiatric institution

43:38.804 --> 43:42.071
for the remainder of her life.

43:42.073 --> 43:45.708
She's been in this facility
for over 10 years now.

43:45.710 --> 43:48.178
Gabrielle continues
to deny the charges,

43:48.180 --> 43:52.148
claiming they were
attacked by zombies.

43:52.150 --> 43:55.018
After a detailed
observation by Dr. Victor,

43:55.020 --> 43:57.787
it has been concluded
that she suffers from

43:57.789 --> 43:59.923
severe bipolar
disorder, depression,

43:59.925 --> 44:04.060
and is prone to extreme, and
often violent, outbursts.

44:04.062 --> 44:08.298
She claims to suffer from
a recurring dream of a...

44:10.367 --> 44:13.169
So-called zombie attack.

44:13.171 --> 44:14.204
- Come on, get her up.

44:14.206 --> 44:15.271
We gotta go.

44:32.323 --> 44:33.656
- Ah.

44:33.658 --> 44:34.757
Gabrielle.

44:34.759 --> 44:36.793
Please, have a seat.

44:36.795 --> 44:38.695
- I think you're wasting
your time, Dr. Marcus.

44:38.697 --> 44:42.098
She hasn't spoken a word
of English in years.

44:48.005 --> 44:49.539
Really?

44:49.541 --> 44:51.621
Why do you believe this is
such a waste of your time?

44:58.415 --> 44:59.415
Hmm?

45:03.554 --> 45:06.422
Well first, I'd like
you to just have a seat,

45:06.424 --> 45:08.758
so why don't you just

45:08.760 --> 45:09.760
sit down?

45:18.969 --> 45:21.371
Gentlemen, I won't
need you any further.

45:21.373 --> 45:23.273
I'll call you if I do.

45:33.984 --> 45:35.652
Yes, I wrote those.

45:36.687 --> 45:38.254
Are you impressed?

45:41.392 --> 45:42.859
I wanna help you.

45:44.561 --> 45:48.798
And I know you understand
what I'm saying, Gabrielle.

45:56.040 --> 45:57.040
True.

45:58.142 --> 45:59.475
I'm writing a book.

45:59.477 --> 46:01.911
Along the way, I might
be able to help you.

46:01.913 --> 46:04.247
I really do wanna help you.

46:10.587 --> 46:12.322
Nobody believes you.

46:13.223 --> 46:14.223
Hmm?

46:27.104 --> 46:29.238
Maybe if you told me

46:29.240 --> 46:30.974
what happened,

46:30.976 --> 46:34.243
I could help you find
peace in all this?

46:34.245 --> 46:35.245
Hmm?

46:39.583 --> 46:41.284
I'm going to turn
on the camera now.

46:42.754 --> 46:43.754
Okay?

56:23.700 --> 56:24.767
- It's okay.

56:26.670 --> 56:28.037
It really is.

56:28.039 --> 56:31.774
I understand, I know
what you are Gabrielle.

56:36.080 --> 56:37.379
You

56:37.381 --> 56:38.814
are a

56:38.816 --> 56:41.116
sick, evil, jealous person,

56:42.419 --> 56:44.620
who brutally murdered a young
lady because you thought

56:44.622 --> 56:47.289
she was having an
affair with your fiance.

56:47.291 --> 56:48.524
And on top of all that,

56:48.526 --> 56:50.292
you want everyone to
believe that a zombie

56:50.294 --> 56:52.428
bit her face off.

56:52.430 --> 56:54.063
- Go to hell!

56:54.065 --> 56:55.998
- Oh, look at that.

56:56.000 --> 56:58.767
The murderer speaks English.

56:58.769 --> 56:59.769
- You liar!

57:00.837 --> 57:02.705
You said you would help me!

57:02.707 --> 57:04.073
I'll kill you!

57:08.445 --> 57:09.445
- Got her.

57:18.154 --> 57:19.154
- Next.

57:20.290 --> 57:22.558
Originally from New Zealand,

57:22.560 --> 57:26.629
Sarah has been institutionalized
since she was 15 years old.

57:26.631 --> 57:28.998
Her parents moved her stateside

57:29.000 --> 57:30.866
when she was 12 in
hopes of getting her

57:30.868 --> 57:33.936
the best mental
healthcare possible.

57:35.105 --> 57:36.605
After attempting suicide,

57:36.607 --> 57:39.041
her parents thought it best
that she be admitted here.

57:39.043 --> 57:43.045
She often wakes up screaming
in the middle of the night and

57:43.047 --> 57:45.447
keeps asking for her shovel.

57:47.350 --> 57:49.985
- The sedatives are kicking in.

57:54.759 --> 57:56.025
Dude.

57:56.027 --> 57:57.626
I'm sick of this job,
she tried to bite me!

57:57.628 --> 57:59.695
- Stop being such a pussy, okay?

57:59.697 --> 58:03.065
- Are you boys ready
for me yet, or what?

58:03.067 --> 58:05.034
Fuck it, let's do this.

58:06.469 --> 58:07.970
- Come on.

58:23.620 --> 58:25.320
- Where the fuck is
my bloody shovel?

58:25.322 --> 58:26.522
- Hey!

58:26.524 --> 58:27.990
Watch your mouth!

58:28.792 --> 58:30.559
- No no, that's fine.

58:32.296 --> 58:33.362
Leave us.

58:33.364 --> 58:36.265
It's all right, I'll be okay.

58:36.267 --> 58:38.567
I'll be fine, I'll be fine.

58:48.778 --> 58:51.413
Sarah, I am Dr. Marcus.

58:51.415 --> 58:53.949
- Hmm, I gathered that.

58:53.951 --> 58:55.651
- I'd like to ask
you a few questions.

58:55.653 --> 58:57.619
- About the murder?

58:57.621 --> 58:59.621
- To start with, yes.

58:59.623 --> 59:01.090
- Ludicrous, you know.

59:01.092 --> 59:03.726
I was put away for the
murder of my best friend.

59:03.728 --> 59:05.828
- You deny doing that?

59:05.830 --> 59:10.365
- My friend was unhappy,
she committed suicide.

59:10.367 --> 59:13.102
- Yeah, but you buried the body.

59:15.038 --> 59:16.505
- Before she did it she asked me

59:16.507 --> 59:18.540
to hide her away afterwards.

59:18.542 --> 59:20.209
It's that simple.

59:20.211 --> 59:22.878
I was just trying
to be a good friend.

59:22.880 --> 59:24.646
That's what I told my parents.

59:24.648 --> 59:26.782
They decided to
move us stateside,

59:26.784 --> 59:28.884
hoping that I could
get some help.

59:28.886 --> 59:30.552
But I don't need any help.

59:30.554 --> 59:32.488
I didn't do anything.

59:32.490 --> 59:34.456
But I bet it'd make
a juicy chapter

59:34.458 --> 59:37.059
for that book you're
going to write, huh?

59:37.061 --> 59:40.028
- Does it bother you
that I'm writing a book?

59:40.030 --> 59:42.464
- Your fame is mine,
isn't that right, doc?

59:42.466 --> 59:43.932
- Sarah, I'm here to help you.

59:46.203 --> 59:48.771
Why don't you tell me what

59:48.773 --> 59:50.339
really happened?

59:53.543 --> 59:55.811
- It was just another day.

59:55.813 --> 59:58.113
Well...

59:58.115 --> 01:00:00.549
I guess it wasn't
exactly the average day

01:00:00.551 --> 01:00:04.787
in the life of a 12 year old.

01:00:07.991 --> 01:00:09.725
- Well what do we say?

01:00:09.727 --> 01:00:11.960
- Let's just tell
her it's going to be okay.

01:00:11.962 --> 01:00:13.295
- We don't know that!

01:00:13.297 --> 01:00:14.463
- I don't know, I've never had

01:00:14.465 --> 01:00:15.798
to deal with a
situation like this.

01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:19.268
- Well neither have I!
- - Good!

01:00:23.039 --> 01:00:24.273
- What are you doing, honey?

01:00:24.275 --> 01:00:25.941
- Making a card for Vic.

01:00:25.943 --> 01:00:27.476
- Oh, that's,

01:00:27.478 --> 01:00:28.977
that's wonderful!

01:00:30.713 --> 01:00:34.049
- Do you think she'll sleep
with the angels like Nana?

01:00:34.051 --> 01:00:35.584
- What, no.

01:00:35.586 --> 01:00:38.153
- Absolutely not, honey.

01:00:39.789 --> 01:00:40.789
- Poor Vic.

01:01:03.146 --> 01:01:05.814
I found one, and
it's really nice.

01:01:05.816 --> 01:01:07.549
But it's 37 dollars.

01:01:12.089 --> 01:01:13.089
Okay.

01:01:22.733 --> 01:01:25.601
- Oh honey, what's wrong?

01:01:25.603 --> 01:01:28.003
Oh, you dropped your ice cream.

01:01:28.005 --> 01:01:29.671
Here you go, here's two dollars.

01:01:29.673 --> 01:01:31.106
Go and get yourself another one.

01:01:31.108 --> 01:01:34.877
- It was three dollars.

01:01:34.879 --> 01:01:36.378
- Christ!

01:01:37.313 --> 01:01:38.780
Here you go, here's five.

01:01:38.782 --> 01:01:40.515
Give me back my two.

01:01:55.231 --> 01:01:58.567
- I only made 12 dollars today.

01:01:58.569 --> 01:01:59.735
- Fuck!

01:01:59.737 --> 01:02:00.736
- I'm sorry!

01:02:00.738 --> 01:02:02.237
- It's okay honey.

01:02:02.239 --> 01:02:03.239
Laser fuck!

01:02:04.374 --> 01:02:06.675
- That'll be two dollars, daddy.

01:02:23.359 --> 01:02:24.493
- Shit!

01:02:25.295 --> 01:02:26.295
Shit!

01:02:27.931 --> 01:02:29.765
Shit shit shit shit shit!

01:02:32.869 --> 01:02:33.869
Oh shit.

01:02:35.905 --> 01:02:38.140
- Yeah I heard
that when I was 24.

01:02:39.376 --> 01:02:40.709
Christ, shit, bitch,

01:02:40.711 --> 01:02:41.877
fuck, ass,

01:02:41.879 --> 01:02:44.413
fuck, cunt, fuck, cunt!

01:02:44.415 --> 01:02:45.881
- Nine.
- - Fuck!

01:02:45.883 --> 01:02:47.516
- 10!

01:02:47.518 --> 01:02:49.952
I still need five more dollars.

01:02:52.790 --> 01:02:55.023
- The police still
can't tell me anything.

01:02:55.025 --> 01:02:56.525
What do you think?

01:02:56.527 --> 01:02:58.493
- Well, I think
it'll be fine, just fine.

01:02:58.495 --> 01:03:00.963
- You can't give up hope Jenny.

01:03:00.965 --> 01:03:02.431
- How's Sarah coping?

01:03:02.433 --> 01:03:04.266
- Well, her best
friend is missing, so...

01:03:04.268 --> 01:03:06.835
- Clive!
- - Well, she is.

01:03:06.837 --> 01:03:08.971
I'm sorry Jenny!

01:03:08.973 --> 01:03:11.373
- Come here, Jenny.

01:03:11.375 --> 01:03:12.574
Look what you've done.

01:03:12.576 --> 01:03:14.009
- It wasn't me!

01:03:14.011 --> 01:03:15.410
- Shh shh.

01:03:28.424 --> 01:03:29.424
- I got it!

01:03:30.793 --> 01:03:32.361
Did you hear that?

01:03:34.030 --> 01:03:36.331
Vic?

01:03:36.333 --> 01:03:38.133
You must be so tired.

01:03:39.736 --> 01:03:41.970
Now you can finally sleep.

01:04:23.613 --> 01:04:25.781
- Why'd you do it?

01:04:25.783 --> 01:04:28.850
I mean, if you were trying
to help your friend,

01:04:28.852 --> 01:04:29.852
then why...

01:04:30.853 --> 01:04:33.088
Why try and kill yourself?

01:04:34.023 --> 01:04:35.023
Guilt?

01:04:36.059 --> 01:04:38.894
Fear of spending the
rest of your life in an

01:04:38.896 --> 01:04:40.996
institution like this?

01:04:40.998 --> 01:04:42.898
- You're the doctor.

01:04:42.900 --> 01:04:43.965
You tell me.

01:04:48.038 --> 01:04:49.504
- Everyone else
around here might be

01:04:49.506 --> 01:04:52.874
buying your smug
little act but I'm not.

01:04:52.876 --> 01:04:54.843
- Get bent, you twat!

01:04:54.845 --> 01:04:56.578
- Now we're really
getting somewhere.

01:04:56.580 --> 01:04:57.979
- No, we're not.

01:05:00.283 --> 01:05:01.983
- Gentlemen, please.

01:05:03.319 --> 01:05:06.888
I'm going to send you
back to the holding tank.

01:05:07.957 --> 01:05:10.859
You keep living your
sorry little existence,

01:05:10.861 --> 01:05:11.861
but me,

01:05:12.695 --> 01:05:15.430
I'm still gonna have a good day.

01:05:16.732 --> 01:05:17.732
- Ah.

01:05:19.302 --> 01:05:21.103
- Get her outta here.

01:05:22.538 --> 01:05:24.039
- Where's my bloody shovel?

01:05:24.041 --> 01:05:26.508
I wanna shove it up his arse!

01:05:26.510 --> 01:05:28.243
Get the fuck off me!

01:05:31.747 --> 01:05:35.884
Doctor's gonna be sorry
when I find my shovel.

01:05:35.886 --> 01:05:39.054
- It's time to see
the doctor, Jessa.

01:05:43.359 --> 01:05:44.893
- Jessa hasn't
spoken a word since

01:05:44.895 --> 01:05:46.695
she was committed
to this institution

01:05:46.697 --> 01:05:48.163
over seven years ago,

01:05:48.165 --> 01:05:50.665
when she was found guilty
of killing her mother

01:05:50.667 --> 01:05:52.167
and her sister.

01:05:52.169 --> 01:05:55.570
She claims an evil
spirit possessed her.

01:05:56.939 --> 01:05:59.674
After repeatedly telling the
story to multiple doctors,

01:05:59.676 --> 01:06:02.377
she simply stopped speaking.

01:06:10.820 --> 01:06:13.054
- I don't know why
you picked her, sir.

01:06:13.056 --> 01:06:15.190
The girl's a mute or something.

01:06:15.192 --> 01:06:17.058
- Yeah but she kind of

01:06:17.060 --> 01:06:19.394
talks with her hands.

01:06:19.396 --> 01:06:21.930
- Which is why I need her
out of those restraints.

01:06:21.932 --> 01:06:22.932
Come on.

01:06:27.036 --> 01:06:29.604
- Well if she does one
knock, that means yes,

01:06:29.606 --> 01:06:30.872
or she likes it.

01:06:30.874 --> 01:06:34.176
And two knocks means
no, or she hates it.

01:06:36.479 --> 01:06:37.579
That's pretty much
all we've been able

01:06:37.581 --> 01:06:39.548
to get from her so far.

01:06:43.786 --> 01:06:47.355
- Thank you Kyle,
that's very informative.

01:06:59.236 --> 01:07:00.435
Jessa.

01:07:00.437 --> 01:07:02.437
Do you know who I am?

01:07:03.273 --> 01:07:04.940
Good, good, good.

01:07:04.942 --> 01:07:06.007
I'm here to help you.

01:07:06.009 --> 01:07:08.543
Now, I'd like to try a little

01:07:08.545 --> 01:07:09.678
hypnotherapy.

01:07:10.580 --> 01:07:12.180
See if I can't

01:07:12.182 --> 01:07:16.451
relax you, get that inner
voice of yours to come out.

01:07:16.453 --> 01:07:19.020
Have you ever been
hypnotized before?

01:07:20.958 --> 01:07:22.791
Do you mind if I try?

01:07:27.863 --> 01:07:29.931
Jessa, I need an answer.

01:07:32.835 --> 01:07:34.236
Look, I know you're frightened,

01:07:34.238 --> 01:07:36.271
that you've got
things that haunt you.

01:07:36.273 --> 01:07:38.840
But I'm not frightened,
I can help you with that.

01:07:38.842 --> 01:07:40.842
But you have to let me.

01:07:42.078 --> 01:07:43.078
Please?

01:07:53.323 --> 01:07:56.057
Thank you for trusting me.

01:07:56.059 --> 01:07:57.059
All right.

01:08:02.265 --> 01:08:04.165
I would like you to

01:08:04.167 --> 01:08:06.968
just concentrate
on this crystal.

01:08:09.872 --> 01:08:11.206
Come on now, breathe.

01:08:11.208 --> 01:08:12.874
Take a deep breath.

01:08:15.544 --> 01:08:16.544
Go inside.

01:08:18.913 --> 01:08:20.715
That's it, go inside.

01:08:21.817 --> 01:08:25.319
Free up that voice
that's talking to you.

01:08:26.788 --> 01:08:28.189
Let it come out.

01:08:30.725 --> 01:08:32.861
Tell me what happened.

01:09:33.322 --> 01:09:34.856
- Takes a real sick person

01:09:34.858 --> 01:09:37.826
to do something
like that to a dog.

01:09:39.528 --> 01:09:40.595
Sorry girls.

01:09:41.464 --> 01:09:43.965
Norman's in doggy heaven now.

01:09:53.209 --> 01:09:54.342
- Was it you?

01:10:00.583 --> 01:10:02.517
- She made me do it.

01:10:02.519 --> 01:10:03.818
- The bad lady?

01:10:04.854 --> 01:10:06.121
Jessa, there's no such thing...

01:10:06.123 --> 01:10:08.356
- she's getting worse.

01:10:08.358 --> 01:10:09.358
Wait.

01:10:15.866 --> 01:10:17.665
Don't you believe me?

01:11:04.980 --> 01:11:06.881
- Jessa...

01:11:36.445 --> 01:11:38.346
- I'll be home by
11 at the latest.

01:11:38.348 --> 01:11:40.415
And eat before it gets cold.

01:11:40.417 --> 01:11:42.550
Jessa sweetie, you listen
to your sister, okay?

01:11:42.552 --> 01:11:44.452
And go to bed on time.

01:11:48.290 --> 01:11:50.291
Come lock up behind me.

01:11:54.730 --> 01:11:58.266
If she seems sad, there's
ice cream in the fridge.

01:11:58.268 --> 01:11:59.367
My girl.

01:11:59.369 --> 01:12:01.269
Always has it together.

01:12:02.872 --> 01:12:03.872
Oh!

01:12:04.607 --> 01:12:05.607
Thanks.

01:12:24.793 --> 01:12:27.128
- She won't leave me alone.

01:12:37.206 --> 01:12:39.874
What are you gonna do to Sally?

01:12:41.343 --> 01:12:42.343
Ow!

01:12:43.946 --> 01:12:45.280
- Sally is you.

01:12:46.649 --> 01:12:49.050
And this is the bad lady.

01:12:49.052 --> 01:12:51.119
- Doesn't look like her.

01:12:53.322 --> 01:12:54.322
- See.

01:12:55.524 --> 01:12:57.325
I think the bad lady,

01:12:58.427 --> 01:13:00.628
she tied herself to you.

01:13:00.630 --> 01:13:03.598
And all we have to
do is untie her.

01:13:04.567 --> 01:13:05.967
Like a shoelace.

01:13:07.236 --> 01:13:10.538
- But what if she
doesn't wanna let go?

01:13:13.410 --> 01:13:14.876
- We'll make her.

01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:47.342
- That's what she looks like.

01:13:51.981 --> 01:13:53.815
- Bowl of reflection,

01:13:53.817 --> 01:13:56.384
stones of protection,

01:13:56.386 --> 01:13:57.852
may the reason of our harm

01:13:57.854 --> 01:14:00.655
feel the power of this charm.

01:14:00.657 --> 01:14:02.290
Powers of the witches rise,

01:14:02.292 --> 01:14:05.193
course unseen across the skies,

01:14:05.195 --> 01:14:06.427
hear me beckon,

01:14:06.429 --> 01:14:07.562
hear my plea.

01:14:08.564 --> 01:14:11.199
Spirits bared, I summon thee.

01:14:16.039 --> 01:14:17.772
Pass me that candle.

01:14:28.217 --> 01:14:29.717
- Kara?

01:14:29.719 --> 01:14:31.285
- Close your eyes.

01:14:32.421 --> 01:14:34.455
Demon who dwells in
slivers of night,

01:14:34.457 --> 01:14:37.425
uncloak your
shadows to my sight.

01:14:37.427 --> 01:14:39.360
Guardians of the ancient towers,

01:14:39.362 --> 01:14:41.429
Grant me now thy sacred powers.

01:14:41.431 --> 01:14:43.831
Let this child be set free.

01:14:43.833 --> 01:14:46.200
Such is my will, I banish thee.

01:14:50.239 --> 01:14:52.640
Let this child be set free!

01:14:52.642 --> 01:14:55.209
With all my might,
I banish thee!

01:14:58.847 --> 01:14:59.981
- Keep going!

01:15:00.716 --> 01:15:02.817
- I banish thee!

01:15:02.819 --> 01:15:04.052
I banish thee!

01:15:29.111 --> 01:15:30.111
No!

01:15:31.313 --> 01:15:33.214
Don't touch my sister!

01:16:08.016 --> 01:16:09.183
- She's gone!

01:16:24.666 --> 01:16:25.666
- Hey.

01:16:30.205 --> 01:16:31.773
Are you all right?

01:16:32.674 --> 01:16:33.508
- Yeah.

01:16:33.510 --> 01:16:35.176
Just glad you're home.

01:16:35.178 --> 01:16:38.045
- Tough night for
both of us, huh?

01:16:38.047 --> 01:16:39.680
You should get to bed.

01:16:39.682 --> 01:16:41.749
- I wanna stay in here a while.

01:16:41.751 --> 01:16:43.651
- Well don't wake her.

01:18:05.001 --> 01:18:06.667
- Kara.

01:18:21.550 --> 01:18:22.550
Kara.

01:18:26.122 --> 01:18:28.422
- I tried to stop her!

01:18:35.197 --> 01:18:36.197
- Mom!

01:18:55.884 --> 01:18:58.552
- Mommy made the same
sounds as Norman.

01:19:01.758 --> 01:19:04.592
I wonder what
sounds you'll make?

01:19:13.201 --> 01:19:14.135
- Don't!

01:19:14.137 --> 01:19:15.336
Don't do that, leave her alone!

01:19:15.338 --> 01:19:16.671
- But she could hurt herself.

01:19:16.673 --> 01:19:19.507
- She's not gonna hurt herself.

01:19:19.509 --> 01:19:23.144
I want her to come out
of this on her own.

01:19:23.146 --> 01:19:24.812
- What did I tell you?

01:19:24.814 --> 01:19:26.814
- Woah, that's a first.

01:19:27.649 --> 01:19:29.650
What do you know?

01:19:29.652 --> 01:19:33.054
- That was absolutely
amazing, young lady.

01:19:33.056 --> 01:19:35.790
It was an incredible
first session.

01:19:35.792 --> 01:19:37.959
Now, I do not want her sedated.

01:19:37.961 --> 01:19:40.094
I want her to be
left to herself.

01:19:40.096 --> 01:19:41.829
I want her to be able to
come to terms with this,

01:19:41.831 --> 01:19:44.298
come to terms with being
a psychotic killer.

01:19:44.300 --> 01:19:45.232
- No!

01:19:45.234 --> 01:19:46.234
No, no!

01:19:49.839 --> 01:19:50.839
No!

01:19:59.381 --> 01:20:00.548
- It's okay.

01:20:00.550 --> 01:20:01.749
It's all right, it's over.

01:20:01.751 --> 01:20:03.851
It's over, it's okay.

01:20:03.853 --> 01:20:07.188
It's okay.

01:20:11.293 --> 01:20:13.027
- Time to go.

01:20:16.765 --> 01:20:18.265
Damon, you're up.

01:20:35.984 --> 01:20:38.986
- Damon believes in
vampires, he always has,

01:20:38.988 --> 01:20:41.322
always will, no matter
what the doctors tell him.

01:20:41.324 --> 01:20:45.192
He was arrested after
hiring someone to kill

01:20:45.194 --> 01:20:48.929
several people who he
thought were vampires.

01:21:08.483 --> 01:21:09.483
- Sir?

01:21:21.496 --> 01:21:23.531
- Damon, what a pleasure.

01:21:23.533 --> 01:21:24.598
Have a seat.

01:21:25.934 --> 01:21:27.401
- I'd rather not.

01:21:28.503 --> 01:21:29.837
- But I insist.

01:21:44.352 --> 01:21:47.521
- I wouldn't mess
with this one, doc.

01:21:55.063 --> 01:21:56.964
- You gentlemen can go.

01:21:56.966 --> 01:21:59.366
I'll call you if I need you.

01:22:12.447 --> 01:22:15.216
- Shall I begin, Dr. Marcus?

01:22:15.218 --> 01:22:18.352
- You don't waste time, do you?

01:22:18.354 --> 01:22:20.921
- They told me about you.

01:22:20.923 --> 01:22:25.092
They said you were really
interested in hearing our stories.

01:22:25.094 --> 01:22:26.160
- It's true.

01:22:27.629 --> 01:22:31.999
- Actually, I tell my story
to anyone who'll listen.

01:22:32.001 --> 01:22:35.636
Problem is, none of the
other doctors believe me.

01:22:35.638 --> 01:22:38.539
- Well I'm not
like other doctors.

01:22:39.407 --> 01:22:41.142
You see, as a child,

01:22:42.010 --> 01:22:44.678
I used to love vampire stories.

01:22:45.580 --> 01:22:47.948
Your case, it intrigued me.

01:22:47.950 --> 01:22:49.750
So I'm gonna ask you,

01:22:50.619 --> 01:22:52.753
do vampires really exist?

01:22:57.159 --> 01:22:59.160
- Humor me if you like.

01:23:00.128 --> 01:23:01.562
I know the truth.

01:23:05.734 --> 01:23:08.369
I had been following
certain people

01:23:08.371 --> 01:23:09.670
til I was sure.

01:23:10.739 --> 01:23:13.207
I hired someone to kill them.

01:23:14.442 --> 01:23:17.711
Do you know that
vampires walk in the day?

01:23:17.713 --> 01:23:20.281
And they don't turn into bats.

01:23:21.183 --> 01:23:23.851
And they only feast on blood

01:23:23.853 --> 01:23:26.086
when they're hungry.

01:23:26.088 --> 01:23:28.656
- That's fascinating.

01:23:28.658 --> 01:23:29.658
- Mm-hmm.

01:23:31.126 --> 01:23:34.094
You learn all kinds
of things when

01:23:34.096 --> 01:23:37.998
you track them all over
the world like I have.

01:23:41.236 --> 01:23:43.637
People like you put me away.

01:23:49.744 --> 01:23:50.744
Idiots.

01:23:54.015 --> 01:23:56.183
They have no idea

01:23:56.185 --> 01:23:57.185
of the evil

01:23:58.053 --> 01:24:00.187
that walks in this world.

01:24:04.492 --> 01:24:07.728
Found a pack of 'em
living in England.

01:24:09.030 --> 01:24:13.701
- Yeah, but somebody
believed you, didn't they?

01:24:13.703 --> 01:24:14.902
Why don't you tell me about

01:24:14.904 --> 01:24:17.738
this man you hired
to kill the...

01:24:17.740 --> 01:24:19.340
Vampires?

01:24:19.342 --> 01:24:21.408
- Ah, it took some time.

01:24:22.344 --> 01:24:24.245
But once I showed him,

01:24:25.480 --> 01:24:26.547
he believed.

01:24:36.224 --> 01:24:38.859
- Di Collins reenters the room.

01:24:40.228 --> 01:24:41.795
Interview resumes.

01:24:43.431 --> 01:24:45.499
The suspect has refused
to offer his name

01:24:45.501 --> 01:24:47.501
or address for the third time.

01:24:54.843 --> 01:24:56.477
I'm gonna call you John.

01:24:56.479 --> 01:24:58.145
That all right?

01:24:58.147 --> 01:24:59.147
John?

01:25:04.452 --> 01:25:06.687
We found you wandering
through the station.

01:25:06.689 --> 01:25:08.389
We were worried because

01:25:08.391 --> 01:25:11.292
you were someone we
wanted to talk to.

01:25:11.294 --> 01:25:12.760
Know why that is?

01:25:20.568 --> 01:25:21.568
Janet gray.

01:25:26.608 --> 01:25:28.742
Did she break your heart?

01:25:31.546 --> 01:25:34.281
Because you broke hers.

01:25:48.096 --> 01:25:51.265
You cut it right
out of her, John.

01:25:51.267 --> 01:25:53.567
How did that make you feel?

01:25:55.270 --> 01:25:57.671
She was just a girl.

01:25:57.673 --> 01:26:00.074
But Reggie, Reggie was scum.

01:26:00.942 --> 01:26:02.576
Dealer, pimp.

01:26:02.578 --> 01:26:04.111
Chelsea fan.

01:26:04.113 --> 01:26:06.947
That's three
strikes right there.

01:26:08.950 --> 01:26:11.785
You took it a bit
too far though.

01:26:15.390 --> 01:26:18.459
- That's a foul,
you fucking Muppet!

01:26:34.142 --> 01:26:38.379
Some people would give you
a pat on the back for that.

01:26:38.381 --> 01:26:39.381
But this...

01:26:44.085 --> 01:26:45.619
Acid?

01:26:45.621 --> 01:26:46.687
In the bath?

01:27:13.448 --> 01:27:16.984
That isn't normal
behavior, John.

01:27:16.986 --> 01:27:19.486
That is just not fucking odd.

01:27:34.502 --> 01:27:35.803
- I hunted her.

01:27:37.205 --> 01:27:40.040
Four missing girls,
all her friends.

01:27:40.042 --> 01:27:41.341
No coincidence.

01:27:45.213 --> 01:27:47.047
He killed seven.

01:27:47.049 --> 01:27:49.716
Prostitutes, addicts, homeless.

01:27:52.987 --> 01:27:55.823
And they'd been
at it for decades.

01:27:55.825 --> 01:27:58.091
Dig up their garden.

01:27:58.093 --> 01:28:01.495
Count the bones of
the children you find.

01:28:05.500 --> 01:28:09.169
I know this won't
stop you for long.

01:28:09.171 --> 01:28:13.874
Sorting the truth from
the fiction took a while.

01:28:13.876 --> 01:28:15.843
But removing the heart.

01:28:16.945 --> 01:28:18.078
Decapitation.

01:28:19.380 --> 01:28:20.380
Holy water.

01:28:21.783 --> 01:28:23.417
Those methods work.

01:28:28.289 --> 01:28:30.991
They couldn't
exist on their own.

01:28:30.993 --> 01:28:33.794
They needed
protection to survive.

01:28:33.796 --> 01:28:35.696
Someone to keep watch.

01:28:39.934 --> 01:28:42.336
- You're confused, John.

01:28:42.338 --> 01:28:44.404
You're scared and confused.

01:28:44.406 --> 01:28:47.241
- A confused man wouldn't have
watched you for three months.

01:28:47.243 --> 01:28:51.478
He wouldn't have snuck
into this room an hour ago.

01:28:53.348 --> 01:28:57.584
A confused man wouldn't
have a stake in his hands.

01:29:25.346 --> 01:29:29.883
- When he was caught and
arrested for the murder of...

01:29:29.885 --> 01:29:31.285
Ordinary people.

01:29:32.854 --> 01:29:34.421
He led them to me.

01:29:35.957 --> 01:29:38.025
- Did that surprise you?

01:29:39.627 --> 01:29:41.528
- We weren't finished.

01:29:44.032 --> 01:29:46.199
- Killing vampires?

01:29:46.201 --> 01:29:47.734
- Precisely.

01:29:47.736 --> 01:29:48.736
- Ah.

01:29:51.339 --> 01:29:54.074
- There's another one out there.

01:29:55.176 --> 01:29:56.310
The main one.

01:29:59.681 --> 01:30:01.081
And I won't stop

01:30:01.983 --> 01:30:03.717
until I hunt it down

01:30:04.552 --> 01:30:05.619
and kill it.

01:30:18.667 --> 01:30:22.135
- Gentlemen, would
you join us, please?

01:30:22.137 --> 01:30:23.670
You know Damon, I
have to tell you,

01:30:23.672 --> 01:30:27.574
of all my patients, you've
been the most fascinating.

01:30:28.943 --> 01:30:32.613
It's been an absolute
pleasure meeting you.

01:30:35.483 --> 01:30:37.884
- The pleasure was all mine.

01:30:43.024 --> 01:30:44.024
Doctor.

01:31:14.355 --> 01:31:16.189
- I loved my mom.

01:31:16.191 --> 01:31:18.125
She was a good mom.

01:31:18.127 --> 01:31:20.527
Until she started seeing it.

01:31:22.597 --> 01:31:24.264
- I could see,

01:31:25.333 --> 01:31:26.333
and feel,

01:31:27.935 --> 01:31:28.935
and hear,

01:31:30.038 --> 01:31:31.038
everything!

01:31:32.407 --> 01:31:33.273
- Where the
fuck is my bloody shovel?

01:31:33.275 --> 01:31:34.275
- Hey!

01:31:36.445 --> 01:31:40.247
- There's another one out there.

01:31:40.249 --> 01:31:41.381
The main one.

01:31:43.985 --> 01:31:45.385
And I won't stop

01:31:46.220 --> 01:31:47.954
until I hunt it down

01:31:48.790 --> 01:31:49.856
and kill it.

01:33:00.962 --> 01:33:01.962
- The hell?

01:34:22.777 --> 01:34:25.011
- Found my shovel, doctor.

01:34:37.892 --> 01:34:40.293
- What are you people doing?

01:34:41.529 --> 01:34:43.096
You know who I am.

01:34:49.770 --> 01:34:52.239
- We sure do, doctor.

01:34:52.241 --> 01:34:53.241
We sure do.

01:34:54.809 --> 01:34:56.776
- Damon there are

01:34:56.778 --> 01:34:58.678
no such thing

01:34:58.680 --> 01:34:59.746
as vampires.

01:35:03.384 --> 01:35:04.885
There just isn't.

01:35:08.055 --> 01:35:09.956
And I'm not a vampire.

01:35:12.460 --> 01:35:13.760
He's having a hallucination,

01:35:13.762 --> 01:35:16.429
he's drawing you people into it.

01:35:16.431 --> 01:35:17.998
- Hmm, nice try,

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:19.900
but I'm not buying it.

01:35:21.235 --> 01:35:22.969
- I'm not a vampire.

01:35:24.272 --> 01:35:25.972
- Hold him down.

01:35:25.974 --> 01:35:27.407
This won't take long.

01:35:31.513 --> 01:35:32.612
- Ah!

01:35:32.614 --> 01:35:34.848
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not.

01:35:36.651 --> 01:35:37.717
No, I'm not.

01:35:38.486 --> 01:35:39.486
No, no!

01:35:41.122 --> 01:35:41.988
No!

01:35:41.990 --> 01:35:42.990
No, no!

01:35:51.999 --> 01:35:53.066
- It's okay.

01:35:54.702 --> 01:35:55.869
Just breathe.

01:35:57.605 --> 01:35:58.605
Breathe.

01:36:12.887 --> 01:36:14.020
Just breathe.

01:36:15.022 --> 01:36:16.756
- You know who I am?

01:36:17.758 --> 01:36:19.559
Do you know who I am?

01:36:21.095 --> 01:36:23.630
- Yes, we know who you are.

01:36:23.632 --> 01:36:25.365
Thank you gentlemen.

01:36:26.600 --> 01:36:27.600
Keys.

01:36:36.410 --> 01:36:38.345
You're not a renowned author.

01:36:38.347 --> 01:36:39.980
You're not a doctor.

01:36:39.982 --> 01:36:41.414
You're Daniel Marcus,

01:36:41.416 --> 01:36:42.749
patient 050980.

01:36:44.118 --> 01:36:46.653
You've been a patient at this
facility for over 30 years.

01:36:46.655 --> 01:36:48.121
You were admitted after
being found guilty

01:36:48.123 --> 01:36:50.090
of murdering your mother, aunt,

01:36:50.092 --> 01:36:52.292
uncle and cousin,

01:36:52.294 --> 01:36:54.294
while on a skiing trip.

01:36:55.396 --> 01:36:56.763
Your attorney managed
to have you placed here

01:36:56.765 --> 01:36:59.432
in our care after
an insanity plea.

01:37:01.603 --> 01:37:02.603
- Paul...

01:37:05.373 --> 01:37:06.740
- We've discussed
this before, Daniel,

01:37:06.742 --> 01:37:08.575
it's doctor Victor.

01:37:08.577 --> 01:37:11.478
Only my friends call me Paul.

01:37:11.480 --> 01:37:13.380
And we're not friends.

01:37:17.852 --> 01:37:19.419
Another bad dream.

01:37:20.521 --> 01:37:22.455
Well, hopefully,

01:37:22.457 --> 01:37:24.290
we can get you to see the
truth about what you did

01:37:24.292 --> 01:37:27.427
and the delusions and
nightmares will eventually stop.

01:37:27.429 --> 01:37:30.530
Pains me to leave you
here in a single cell.

01:37:30.532 --> 01:37:32.432
But with all your
recent outbursts,

01:37:32.434 --> 01:37:34.300
you've left me little choice.

01:37:34.302 --> 01:37:36.336
The other patients, and
even some of the staff,

01:37:36.338 --> 01:37:37.637
are frightened of you.

01:37:41.909 --> 01:37:46.446
I'd like to move you back
into the main ward, but,

01:37:46.448 --> 01:37:49.783
I'm gonna need you
to help me help you.

01:37:52.486 --> 01:37:56.723
I'm going to give you one more
chance to tell me the truth.

01:37:58.559 --> 01:38:01.161
Take me back to where it began.

01:38:07.368 --> 01:38:08.601
- I was young.

01:38:10.004 --> 01:38:12.439
I didn't wanna hurt anybody.

01:38:12.441 --> 01:38:14.174
I didn't hurt my family.

01:38:14.176 --> 01:38:16.342
I wouldn't hurt my mother.

01:38:16.344 --> 01:38:18.011
I wouldn't hurt her.

01:38:18.013 --> 01:38:19.013
No.

01:38:47.341 --> 01:38:48.341
- Shh.

01:47:57.824 --> 01:48:00.426
I wouldn't hurt my mother.

01:48:04.965 --> 01:48:06.599
- Well I was hoping
we would make

01:48:06.601 --> 01:48:08.768
some progress, Daniel, but...

01:48:08.770 --> 01:48:12.171
You just wanna tell
outrageous stories.

01:48:12.173 --> 01:48:13.839
- They're all true.

01:48:14.908 --> 01:48:16.409
They're all true.

01:48:18.078 --> 01:48:19.278
- You really expect
me to believe

01:48:19.280 --> 01:48:21.781
your tall tales
about serial killers,

01:48:21.783 --> 01:48:24.684
demons, vampires,
ghosts, zombies?

01:48:26.019 --> 01:48:28.187
The truth is, you murdered
multiple people in cold blood,

01:48:28.189 --> 01:48:30.723
starting with your own family.

01:48:30.725 --> 01:48:32.358
Instead of taking
responsibility for it,

01:48:32.360 --> 01:48:34.393
you'd rather make
up fairy tales.

01:48:34.395 --> 01:48:36.128
Well you might have
everybody else fooled,

01:48:36.130 --> 01:48:38.164
but you're nothing but a liar,

01:48:38.166 --> 01:48:39.965
who faked his mental
state of health

01:48:39.967 --> 01:48:42.635
to avoid the death penalty.

01:48:51.178 --> 01:48:52.411
You can stay down
here for the rest

01:48:52.413 --> 01:48:55.614
of your miserable
life for all I care.

01:48:57.984 --> 01:48:59.218
You know what?

01:49:02.289 --> 01:49:05.491
I am still gonna
have a good day.

01:49:27.614 --> 01:49:30.449
- How's that for
a good day, huh?

01:50:18.765 --> 01:50:20.499
My patients need me.

01:50:29.910 --> 01:50:32.311
I only let my friends
call me Daniel.

01:50:32.313 --> 01:50:34.713
You can help me help you.

01:50:34.715 --> 01:50:37.449
I'm still gonna have a good day.

01:50:45.725 --> 01:50:47.726
Time to make my rounds.

01:50:58.905 --> 01:50:59.805
- Welcome back...

01:50:59.807 --> 01:51:00.806
Oh help!

01:51:00.808 --> 01:51:03.042
Help!
