WEBVTT

00:00.583 --> 00:02.085
- I've spent the last decade

00:02.085 --> 00:03.618
tackling struggling restaurants.

00:03.618 --> 00:05.524
You're screwing the business.

00:05.524 --> 00:07.351
You can't even cook a
fucking burger in there.

00:07.351 --> 00:08.219
Fuck off.

00:08.219 --> 00:09.916
Ding, ding, round fucking two.

00:09.916 --> 00:12.908
But now I'm taking on an
even bigger set of problems.

00:12.908 --> 00:15.126
I'm checking into "Hotel Hell."

00:16.184 --> 00:17.053
Oh my god.

00:18.414 --> 00:20.072
My head is spinning.

00:20.072 --> 00:22.522
I'm gonna be staying in
America's worst hotels,

00:22.522 --> 00:24.277
so you don't have to.

00:25.900 --> 00:26.769
- I'm not sleeping here,

00:26.769 --> 00:28.719
we're checking out.
- No way. This is bad.

00:29.665 --> 00:31.459
- This is the mattress cover.

00:31.459 --> 00:33.543
(guests exclaiming)

00:33.543 --> 00:37.640
Fuck me, it's like being
in Danny Devito's house.

00:37.640 --> 00:38.844
Look at this shower.

00:43.229 --> 00:44.246
Help.

00:44.246 --> 00:45.524
(Gordon banging)

00:45.524 --> 00:46.910
Let me out.

00:46.910 --> 00:49.334
Tonight, I'll be trying
to bring a haunted hotel

00:49.334 --> 00:51.022
back to life.

00:51.022 --> 00:54.526
- There's a little girl who
supposedly haunts the hotel.

00:55.666 --> 00:57.615
(girl giggles)

00:57.615 --> 00:58.484
- Shit.

00:58.484 --> 01:00.018
The hotel's ex-military owner-

01:00.018 --> 01:01.947
- I'm the owner and I'll say
that's how we're gonna do it.

01:01.947 --> 01:04.230
- Runs the hotel like a dictatorship.

01:04.230 --> 01:06.691
Oh, you're like a little
fucking Hitler around here.

01:06.691 --> 01:07.588
- Dammit, he's wrong.

01:07.588 --> 01:09.652
- Can I save a marriage in crisis

01:09.652 --> 01:12.259
and rescue a hotel on
the brink of disaster?

01:12.259 --> 01:15.638
- We're gonna make it go
or we're gonna shut it up.

01:15.638 --> 01:17.030
- Sell the place, sell it,

01:17.030 --> 01:18.959
'cause this is madness.

01:18.959 --> 01:22.087
(upbeat rock music)

01:46.283 --> 01:49.438
This is the historic Cambridge
Hotel in Upstate New York.

01:49.438 --> 01:51.538
It's set in stunning countryside,

01:51.538 --> 01:54.082
a few hours drive from Manhattan.

01:54.082 --> 01:57.283
The hotel has 16 bedrooms
and a large restaurant,

01:57.283 --> 02:00.286
and has had its doors
open for almost 150 years.

02:00.286 --> 02:02.007
- Welcome to the Cambridge Hotel.

02:02.893 --> 02:05.761
- Ex-military man and
local lawyer, John Imhof,

02:05.761 --> 02:09.277
persuaded his family to help
him buy the hotel in 2007.

02:10.422 --> 02:12.163
- I remember sitting in my hot tub,

02:12.163 --> 02:13.998
smoking a cigar, drinking bourbon

02:13.998 --> 02:15.281
and life was good.

02:15.281 --> 02:17.679
And I wanted to take my wife
someplace nice for dinner.

02:17.679 --> 02:19.994
So I said to her, why don't
we buy the Cambridge Hotel

02:19.994 --> 02:22.517
and then we'd have a place to go.

02:22.517 --> 02:24.269
- He must've hit me at a weak moment,

02:24.269 --> 02:26.587
because I said sure.

02:28.878 --> 02:31.568
- [Gordon] With zero hospitality
experience between them-

02:31.568 --> 02:32.579
- Which one is 827?

02:32.579 --> 02:34.133
I don't know the numbers.

02:34.133 --> 02:36.153
- [Gordon] The hotel currently
falls shockingly short

02:36.153 --> 02:38.033
of guest expectations.

02:38.033 --> 02:39.044
- It's dingy.
- It's nasty.

02:39.044 --> 02:41.348
- And there's hair all in through here.

02:41.348 --> 02:42.985
- [Male Guest] All over these pillows.

02:42.985 --> 02:44.647
- [Female Guest] It'd be nice
if we had a remote control.

02:44.647 --> 02:46.750
- There's just gobs of hair.

02:46.750 --> 02:49.878
- We've had remote controls
since when, the '70s?

02:49.878 --> 02:50.746
- I'm not sleeping here,

02:50.746 --> 02:53.580
we're checking out.
- No way, this is bad.

02:53.580 --> 02:55.998
- When I bought the hotel, I didn't intend

02:55.998 --> 02:57.239
to be a hands-on owner.

02:57.239 --> 03:00.160
But I am always at the
hotel doing something.

03:00.160 --> 03:01.827
One person has to be in charge.

03:01.827 --> 03:05.011
- Get 84 emails, 70 from John.

03:05.883 --> 03:08.219
John is a control freak.

03:08.219 --> 03:09.460
- How we doing on that chicken?

03:09.460 --> 03:10.328
- Working hard.

03:10.328 --> 03:11.334
- [John] We can do better, chef.

03:11.334 --> 03:12.755
- I'm ready to murder him.

03:12.755 --> 03:14.746
With this menu, there's
a lot restrictions to it,

03:14.746 --> 03:15.977
our budget's really tight,

03:15.977 --> 03:18.646
the creativity's kind
of gone out the window.

03:18.646 --> 03:19.717
- Britt, all the rooms clean?

03:19.717 --> 03:21.639
- Yeah, all the rooms coming in.

03:21.639 --> 03:23.561
- I am currently the general manager.

03:23.561 --> 03:25.111
- I'll finish this up.

03:25.111 --> 03:26.717
- But John takes away my control.

03:26.717 --> 03:27.700
I have no control.

03:28.969 --> 03:30.804
- [Gordon] But General
John's hands-on approach

03:30.804 --> 03:32.191
isn't working.

03:32.191 --> 03:34.454
Nobody wants to stay
and the hotel is losing

03:34.454 --> 03:36.205
thousands of dollars every month.

03:36.205 --> 03:39.375
- John wants to put
every penny that we have

03:39.375 --> 03:41.992
into this hotel and that is something

03:41.992 --> 03:43.682
I am no longer willing to do.

03:43.682 --> 03:47.800
- We are $750,000 in debt,

03:47.800 --> 03:50.501
but failure's not an option
and I don't intend to fail

03:50.501 --> 03:51.369
at the hotel.

03:51.369 --> 03:53.702
- [Gordon] Unless I can
fix things and fast,

03:53.702 --> 03:56.803
John and Tina will lose their
business and their home.

03:56.803 --> 04:01.108
- If Gordon Ramsey can't fix
us, who the hell else can?

04:04.407 --> 04:06.913
(dramatic music)

04:06.913 --> 04:09.572
- Wow, the real sense of grandeur.

04:09.572 --> 04:10.907
Definitely some history here.

04:10.907 --> 04:12.909
Cambridge Hotel, established 1885,

04:12.909 --> 04:14.900
home of pie a la mode.

04:14.900 --> 04:15.807
I've been across America,

04:15.807 --> 04:17.684
I did not realise it came from here.

04:20.822 --> 04:21.798
Morning.

04:21.798 --> 04:23.492
- Good morning, welcome
to the Cambridge Hotel.

04:23.492 --> 04:24.653
- Good to see you.

04:24.653 --> 04:26.089
Gordon, and your first name, sorry?

04:26.089 --> 04:27.611
- My name is Brittany, I'm the manager.

04:27.611 --> 04:29.290
I have you in room 117.

04:29.290 --> 04:32.166
That is $105 during the weekday

04:32.166 --> 04:35.588
and $135 on the weekend.
- Okay.

04:35.588 --> 04:38.424
- I think Gordon's first
impression of the hotel

04:38.424 --> 04:41.250
is going to be, what the
fuck are these people doing?

04:41.250 --> 04:44.253
- The Cambridge Hotel, R.I.P, seriously?

04:44.253 --> 04:45.121
- [Brittany] Yes.

04:45.121 --> 04:46.348
- It's died, you mean?

04:46.348 --> 04:51.562
- No, rest in peace is
the ghosts that live here.

04:52.366 --> 04:53.971
We are haunted.

04:53.971 --> 04:54.839
- Oh, come on.

04:54.839 --> 04:57.727
- There's a little girl who
supposedly haunts the hotel.

04:58.996 --> 04:59.865
Alice.

05:01.890 --> 05:02.759
- Alice?

05:02.759 --> 05:03.627
- Alice.

05:04.971 --> 05:06.358
- [Gordon] Oh my good god,

05:06.358 --> 05:08.047
she looks like something
out of "The Exorcist."

05:08.047 --> 05:10.268
- [Brittany] She was
four years old in 1913.

05:10.268 --> 05:11.227
- [Gordon] When she died?

05:11.227 --> 05:13.306
- I believe in ghosts at the hotel.

05:14.303 --> 05:15.909
I absolutely believe in them.

05:15.909 --> 05:16.795
Gonna go up the stairs.

05:16.795 --> 05:18.453
- They're creaky as well.

05:18.453 --> 05:19.322
And, oh god.

05:21.175 --> 05:22.400
Are they the owners?

05:22.400 --> 05:25.022
- No, I don't know who they are,

05:25.022 --> 05:25.891
those have been here.

05:25.891 --> 05:28.633
- This place is littered
with freaky pictures.

05:28.633 --> 05:30.434
- [Brittany] Yeah.

05:30.434 --> 05:31.508
- [Gordon] What's upstairs there?

05:31.508 --> 05:32.895
- [Brittany] That is our third floor.

05:32.895 --> 05:33.938
- Why is that roped off?

05:33.938 --> 05:37.224
- [Brittany] Because it is
not accessible to our guests.

05:37.224 --> 05:38.765
- Is that where the ghosts are?

05:38.765 --> 05:40.872
- Well, that's where people say they are.

05:40.872 --> 05:43.656
If he goes up on the third floor,

05:43.656 --> 05:46.189
he is going to freak out.

05:46.189 --> 05:47.574
This is your room.

05:47.574 --> 05:50.792
- Oh my god, bloody hell.

05:50.792 --> 05:53.912
Look at the wallpaper.

05:53.912 --> 05:55.466
What's the post up there?

05:55.466 --> 05:56.992
What is that?

05:56.992 --> 05:57.878
- Just there.

05:57.878 --> 05:59.150
- So there's no handcuffs.

05:59.150 --> 06:00.078
- No.

06:00.078 --> 06:00.947
- No, okay.

06:00.947 --> 06:02.523
So it's not a sex thing.

06:02.523 --> 06:03.433
- (laughs) It is not a sex thing.

06:03.433 --> 06:05.710
- It's a really weird
thing to have in the bed.

06:05.710 --> 06:06.579
- I know.

06:08.493 --> 06:09.768
- Oh shit, oh shit.

06:11.137 --> 06:13.451
(lamp rumbles)

06:13.451 --> 06:14.668
- Well.
- Shit.

06:16.272 --> 06:17.502
- Welcome to the Cambridge Hotel.

06:17.502 --> 06:18.371
- Thank you.

06:18.371 --> 06:21.384
Christ almighty, I am not gonna
forget this day in a hurry.

06:23.706 --> 06:26.688
Horrible linen, rough and nasty.

06:26.688 --> 06:29.688
Holes, look at that.

06:29.688 --> 06:32.300
And the bed doesn't even fit the base.

06:32.300 --> 06:36.083
Honestly, I've seen better
linen inside hospitals.

06:36.083 --> 06:36.952
Horrible.

06:38.043 --> 06:40.243
My bedroom is dated and uncomfortable.

06:40.243 --> 06:41.860
How could anyone think
this was good enough

06:41.860 --> 06:43.403
for paying customers?

06:43.403 --> 06:44.271
- Bye bye.

06:45.609 --> 06:47.094
- [Gordon] Can I meet the owners?

06:47.094 --> 06:47.963
- Yes.

06:47.963 --> 06:49.183
I'll be right back with the owners.

06:52.023 --> 06:54.281
- Look how dead they are.

06:54.281 --> 06:57.071
- Gordon, this is Tina and John Imhof.

06:57.071 --> 06:58.463
- Tina, nice to see you.

06:58.463 --> 06:59.475
- Nice to see you.
- Gordon.

06:59.475 --> 07:00.347
- Nice to meet you, sir, John.

07:00.347 --> 07:01.713
- Likewise, good to see you both.

07:01.713 --> 07:02.829
It's quite amazing when you drive up

07:02.829 --> 07:04.591
and you see the sort of
statue of the building.

07:04.591 --> 07:05.459
- Yes, sir.

07:05.459 --> 07:06.328
- [Tina] Isn't it beautiful?

07:06.328 --> 07:07.890
- It's stunning, until we get inside.

07:07.890 --> 07:09.194
(Tina gasps)

07:09.194 --> 07:11.348
- Hotel experience prior to this was what?

07:11.348 --> 07:13.224
- Very, very little.

07:13.224 --> 07:14.093
- No, none.

07:14.093 --> 07:15.237
- None.

07:15.237 --> 07:17.406
- So year one, what was the profit?

07:17.406 --> 07:19.668
- We lost about $350,000 the first year.

07:19.668 --> 07:20.537
- Year two?

07:20.537 --> 07:21.897
- $250,000.

07:21.897 --> 07:22.922
- Profit?

07:22.922 --> 07:23.790
- Loss.

07:23.790 --> 07:24.659
- Loss?

07:24.659 --> 07:27.019
So we're in for $600,000

07:27.019 --> 07:28.770
within 24 months of business.

07:28.770 --> 07:30.273
Who's funding this?

07:30.273 --> 07:32.133
- Well, my mom and dad have put in-

07:32.133 --> 07:33.069
- Us.

07:33.069 --> 07:35.486
- Several hundred thousand dollars.

07:35.486 --> 07:36.355
- Wow.

07:36.355 --> 07:37.364
- Our children.

07:37.364 --> 07:38.708
- Our children.

07:38.708 --> 07:39.918
- Your children?
- Yes.

07:39.918 --> 07:43.028
- Shea has put about
$25,000 on credit cards.

07:43.028 --> 07:44.450
- Shea is your?

07:44.450 --> 07:45.329
- [Tina] The oldest daughter.

07:45.329 --> 07:46.383
- Your oldest daughter, right.

07:46.383 --> 07:47.851
- The chef's significant other.

07:47.851 --> 07:48.719
- Okay.

07:48.719 --> 07:49.886
- And so my youngest daughter

07:49.886 --> 07:51.607
just lent us $10,000.

07:51.607 --> 07:52.774
- Your youngest daughter?

07:52.774 --> 07:54.026
- She's in college.

07:54.026 --> 07:55.198
- Is your house on the line next?

07:55.198 --> 07:57.098
- Yes, it is up for sale.

07:57.098 --> 07:58.436
- And we would live here.

07:58.436 --> 08:00.230
We would move onto the third floor.

08:00.230 --> 08:01.147
- Where do you draw the line

08:01.147 --> 08:03.619
and say stop, this is not working?

08:03.619 --> 08:04.974
You're standing there like proud cock,

08:04.974 --> 08:06.413
very confident, very happy,

08:06.413 --> 08:07.602
and like nothing's gone wrong.

08:07.602 --> 08:09.520
But taking money from your daughter

08:09.520 --> 08:11.741
that hasn't even started one foot

08:11.741 --> 08:12.847
on the path of her career?
- I would never ask her.

08:12.847 --> 08:15.962
- I believed that we would
be able to turn it around.

08:15.962 --> 08:16.892
- I know, but John, I'm sorry,

08:16.892 --> 08:18.790
your parent's money, your family's money,

08:18.790 --> 08:19.791
your daughter's money.

08:19.791 --> 08:21.324
- I do have a positive attitude.

08:21.324 --> 08:23.256
- There's a difference
between sounding positive

08:23.256 --> 08:28.070
and sounding full of crap.

08:28.070 --> 08:30.103
- He doesn't know me and he
doesn't know the situation.

08:30.103 --> 08:31.428
I'm a military guy,

08:31.428 --> 08:33.616
I'm not gonna take Chef Ramsay's bullshit.

08:37.836 --> 08:38.986
- [Gordon] I've just met the owners

08:38.986 --> 08:40.624
of the struggling Cambridge Hotel

08:40.624 --> 08:41.969
and discovered they've borrow money

08:41.969 --> 08:43.982
from their kids to stay open.

08:43.982 --> 08:45.765
- I do have a positive attitude.

08:45.765 --> 08:47.761
- There's a difference
between sounding positive

08:47.761 --> 08:51.284
and sounding full of crap.

08:53.658 --> 08:54.555
Unbelievable.

08:54.555 --> 08:56.077
Tina, how'd you manage?

08:56.077 --> 08:57.808
- I don't know how I manage,

08:57.808 --> 09:00.884
and I was very close to
running away several times.

09:00.884 --> 09:03.908
- Wow, seriously?

09:03.908 --> 09:06.285
Unreal, thank you.

09:06.285 --> 09:08.737
- I've been frustrated for years

09:08.737 --> 09:10.689
with him not listening to me.

09:10.689 --> 09:13.292
When somebody doesn't
listen to you for a while,

09:13.292 --> 09:14.265
you just give up.

09:15.768 --> 09:18.318
- What is it about John
that's driven his wife

09:18.318 --> 09:20.279
and potential guests away?

09:20.279 --> 09:22.260
I need to watch the general in action.

09:23.373 --> 09:28.564
(vacuum whirring)
(playful music)

09:28.564 --> 09:30.101
What are you doing with a Hoover?

09:30.101 --> 09:31.112
Welcome, nice to see you,

09:31.112 --> 09:33.438
sorry about the owner walking
through with a Hoover.

09:33.438 --> 09:34.710
Are you joining us for a sleepover

09:34.710 --> 09:35.925
or are you joining us for dinner?

09:35.925 --> 09:36.794
- Dinner.

09:36.794 --> 09:37.663
- Excellent.
- Dammit!

09:37.663 --> 09:39.485
Cambridge Hotel, how may I help you?

09:39.485 --> 09:41.251
- [Gordon] John keeps
himself constantly busy,

09:41.251 --> 09:43.555
but he's busy doing all the wrong things.

09:44.907 --> 09:46.424
His non-stop fussing and fidgeting

09:46.424 --> 09:48.539
is killing the hotel's atmosphere.

09:54.323 --> 09:56.335
The tables in the bar might be clean,

09:56.335 --> 09:57.743
but I've got an eerie feeling

09:57.743 --> 09:59.370
the food's gonna be filthy.

09:59.370 --> 10:00.673
Only one way to find out.

10:02.717 --> 10:03.585
- Hello, sir.

10:03.585 --> 10:04.454
- How are you?

10:04.454 --> 10:06.276
- Good, my name is Phillip,
I'll be your server.

10:06.276 --> 10:07.318
- You wanna?

10:10.329 --> 10:12.472
- Thank you, I'm a little nervous.

10:12.472 --> 10:13.861
- So am I.

10:13.861 --> 10:15.188
What would you recommend?

10:15.188 --> 10:19.703
- Well, the soup du jour
today is a vegetarian lentil.

10:19.703 --> 10:20.756
- Vegetarian lentil?
- Yep.

10:20.756 --> 10:22.956
- And what was the soup du jour yesterday?

10:22.956 --> 10:24.165
- It was also the vegetarian lentil.

10:24.165 --> 10:25.938
- Oh, so soup every two days?

10:25.938 --> 10:28.227
- Actually, it's longer than two days.

10:28.227 --> 10:30.113
- I'll go for the pork and beans.

10:30.113 --> 10:31.531
Duck confit.
- Yeah.

10:31.531 --> 10:33.299
- And pie a la mode.

10:33.299 --> 10:34.645
- Okay.
- Okay, I think we're done.

10:34.645 --> 10:36.615
- [Phillip] Okay, thank you.

10:36.615 --> 10:38.317
- Thank you very much, Chef.

10:38.317 --> 10:40.004
- Thank you.

10:40.004 --> 10:41.380
- Chef order's up.

10:41.380 --> 10:42.465
- [Rich] Okay, thank you.

10:42.465 --> 10:44.321
Get them going brother, get them going.

10:44.321 --> 10:47.115
- I think that Gordon
is gonna love the food.

10:47.115 --> 10:48.578
Chef Rich is great.

10:49.524 --> 10:50.741
We put out excellent food.

10:50.741 --> 10:51.679
- [Rich] The Chef.

10:53.997 --> 10:55.092
- Wow, look at that.

10:55.092 --> 10:57.292
- This is the pork and beans.

10:57.292 --> 10:58.432
- Holy mackerel.

10:59.553 --> 11:02.681
(suspenseful music)

11:05.855 --> 11:07.396
It's cold in the middle.

11:07.396 --> 11:10.409
Both of you, yeah, just
touch the meat there, please.

11:10.409 --> 11:11.958
- Ice cold.
- That's it, touch that.

11:11.958 --> 11:13.183
- [Brittany] Ice cold.

11:13.183 --> 11:14.674
- I can see why we've
got R.I.P on the front

11:14.674 --> 11:15.925
of the fucking reception.

11:15.925 --> 11:17.510
- Those are two medium
rares, right, Scooter,

11:17.510 --> 11:18.908
chuck them in the oven, please.

11:18.908 --> 11:21.900
- [Phillip] Chef, ice cold in the middle.

11:21.900 --> 11:23.506
- Tell him it's a sous-vide product,

11:23.506 --> 11:25.216
we cook it to order.

11:25.216 --> 11:26.571
- It disappoints me a little bit

11:26.571 --> 11:28.748
that we are boiling in bags,

11:28.748 --> 11:30.815
putting stuff in the microwave.

11:30.815 --> 11:34.664
I wish we could actually
cook with fresher food.

11:34.664 --> 11:38.594
- The duck confit, and Chef
said the pork and beans

11:38.594 --> 11:41.055
was a sous-vide product
and it's cooked to order.

11:41.055 --> 11:42.442
- Sous-vide?

11:42.442 --> 11:43.693
Oh, cooked in a bag?

11:43.693 --> 11:44.829
- Yes, they're frozen.

11:44.829 --> 11:46.331
- Frozen?
- Yes.

11:46.331 --> 11:47.816
- And this plate is frozen?

11:47.816 --> 11:50.512
- I think that's a
sous-vide product as well.

11:50.512 --> 11:52.003
- Do we have anything that is homemade?

11:52.003 --> 11:53.432
Are the apple pies made here?

11:53.432 --> 11:54.777
- The apple pies are made here.

11:54.777 --> 11:56.487
- Okay, can you hurry up
with the desserts, please?

11:56.487 --> 11:58.166
- Sure thing.
- Thank you.

11:58.166 --> 12:00.626
So far, everything has been terrible.

12:00.626 --> 12:04.184
Surely, the hotel's signature
dish is gonna be better.

12:04.184 --> 12:05.353
How is the apple pie?

12:07.034 --> 12:10.105
- We just told them we don't
wanna complain anymore.

12:10.105 --> 12:10.973
- I'm sorry.

12:10.973 --> 12:13.087
But this is the home
of Apple Pie a la Mode.

12:13.087 --> 12:13.955
- But if it's the home
of Apple Pie a la Mode,

12:13.955 --> 12:15.426
it should be really bad ass.

12:16.446 --> 12:17.315
- Stay away from it.

12:17.315 --> 12:20.818
- It looked like there was
vomit on the top of it.

12:20.818 --> 12:23.201
I'm bringing it home for my dog.

12:23.201 --> 12:24.494
- [John] Okay.

12:24.494 --> 12:25.467
- Wow.

12:25.467 --> 12:28.334
(dramatic music)

12:30.597 --> 12:31.960
- Pie a la mode, Gordon.

12:31.960 --> 12:34.285
- So this is it, this is the famous-

12:34.285 --> 12:36.089
- That is the pie a la mode.

12:36.089 --> 12:38.299
- Shit, this plate is absolutely
roasting in the centre,

12:38.299 --> 12:39.363
has it been microwaved?

12:39.363 --> 12:40.232
- It has.

12:41.845 --> 12:43.669
- The apples are raw.

12:43.669 --> 12:44.594
If there's one thing I was expecting,

12:44.594 --> 12:47.542
was a decent apple pie and that is gross.

12:47.542 --> 12:49.748
I need to find out who's responsible

12:49.748 --> 12:51.949
for the terrible food here.

12:51.949 --> 12:52.877
Hello.

12:52.877 --> 12:55.567
- If Chef Ramsey criticises Chef's food-

12:55.567 --> 12:56.827
- Where is Chef?

12:56.827 --> 12:58.632
- I think Rich will blow up

12:58.632 --> 13:00.635
because Rich does take things personally.

13:00.635 --> 13:02.929
- I don't know where
to start, to be honest.

13:03.872 --> 13:06.681
What the fuck is going on?

13:06.681 --> 13:08.257
- Well, tell me what you didn't like.

13:08.257 --> 13:09.810
Can you be a little bit more constructive?

13:09.810 --> 13:11.885
- Shall we start from the pork and beans?

13:11.885 --> 13:13.345
Stone fucking cold.

13:13.345 --> 13:14.214
- It's a sous-vide product.

13:14.214 --> 13:15.399
- [Gordon] So you don't even cook that?

13:15.399 --> 13:16.324
- No, it's a sous-vide.

13:16.324 --> 13:17.672
- No, and can you cook?

13:17.672 --> 13:18.541
- Yes.

13:18.541 --> 13:19.552
- So why buy that in?

13:20.936 --> 13:21.853
- Price.

13:21.853 --> 13:25.782
- You buy a store bought
frozen piece of pork,

13:25.782 --> 13:28.537
boiled in a bag, and serve it to me

13:28.537 --> 13:29.590
stone cold in the centre.

13:29.590 --> 13:31.092
You're not even cooking.

13:31.092 --> 13:32.791
So you're just too lazy to do it.

13:32.791 --> 13:34.220
- That's not true, I am not lazy.

13:34.220 --> 13:36.670
- This menu could be run
now without you being here.

13:36.670 --> 13:38.005
- Yes, it's the way I designed it.

13:38.005 --> 13:40.174
- It's the way you designed it,

13:40.174 --> 13:42.186
so you are lazy then?

13:42.186 --> 13:43.246
- I'm not lazy.

13:43.246 --> 13:46.222
If Gordon calls me lazy one more time,

13:46.222 --> 13:48.025
it could cause a problem.

13:48.025 --> 13:51.042
Might be going back to
Britain in a body bag.

13:51.042 --> 13:53.909
(dramatic music)

13:55.585 --> 13:57.577
- I just tasted the food
at the Cambridge Hotel

13:57.577 --> 13:58.821
and it was awful.

13:58.821 --> 14:01.174
I think it's because the chef is lazy.

14:01.174 --> 14:02.509
But he's adamant he's not.

14:02.509 --> 14:04.584
That menu stinks of laziness.

14:04.584 --> 14:05.452
- I'm not lazy.

14:05.452 --> 14:06.898
I'm her 80, 90 hours a week.

14:06.898 --> 14:09.974
- Yeah, you can't call yourself
an executive chef, come on.

14:10.944 --> 14:12.519
Do you know it's store bought?

14:12.519 --> 14:13.666
- I did.

14:13.666 --> 14:14.761
- Why would you employ a chef

14:14.761 --> 14:18.309
that two thirds of the
menu is store bought?

14:19.223 --> 14:21.861
- I think Gordon believes
that I'm incompetent

14:21.861 --> 14:23.123
in running a hotel,

14:23.123 --> 14:24.991
but what I'm doing is right.

14:24.991 --> 14:28.010
- Your hotel became famous
for this apple pie, right?/

14:28.010 --> 14:30.777
And this is the dish
that is trying to stop

14:30.777 --> 14:33.115
your house being put up for sale

14:33.115 --> 14:34.513
to keep this place kept up.

14:34.513 --> 14:35.729
What I'm trying to say

14:35.729 --> 14:37.742
is there are so many basics wrong,

14:37.742 --> 14:39.024
I could fucking cry.

14:39.024 --> 14:41.408
I could seriously cry.
- [Tina] I could cry too.

14:41.408 --> 14:42.277
- And look at the apples.

14:42.277 --> 14:44.665
Look, the apples are raw, not even baked.

14:44.665 --> 14:46.488
I could scream when I see that.

14:46.488 --> 14:48.723
This was invented here.
- I'm not happy.

14:48.723 --> 14:51.378
- There's thousands of
restaurants across the globe

14:51.378 --> 14:54.185
that have copied what you originated.

14:54.185 --> 14:56.709
Have you any idea how lucky you are?

14:56.709 --> 14:57.908
And it resolves to that?

14:57.908 --> 15:02.882
Soggy, undercooked, soaking wet piss pie.

15:02.882 --> 15:03.841
Can I have a quick word with you

15:03.841 --> 15:04.894
for two seconds, please?
- Sure.

15:04.894 --> 15:05.978
- [Gordon] I'm struggling to understand

15:05.978 --> 15:07.105
what's going on here.

15:07.105 --> 15:09.086
I need to hear a woman's perspective.

15:09.086 --> 15:13.538
- John is smart in what
he does as a lawyer.

15:13.538 --> 15:15.561
He's awful here.

15:15.561 --> 15:18.331
I can't get it in his head.

15:18.331 --> 15:19.836
- But between the two of them,

15:19.836 --> 15:21.835
they're about to take
your fucking house down.

15:21.835 --> 15:22.703
- I know.

15:22.703 --> 15:24.507
Him and John go back and forth.

15:24.507 --> 15:26.322
When I give suggestions, it's pretty much,

15:26.322 --> 15:29.481
you know, and then it's pushed aside

15:29.481 --> 15:31.739
and then John is making decisions.

15:31.739 --> 15:33.996
- You're about to lose your house.

15:33.996 --> 15:34.865
- I know!

15:34.865 --> 15:36.763
And he says, we are going

15:36.763 --> 15:39.619
until I haven't got
another penny to put in it.

15:39.619 --> 15:41.627
- [Gordon] He's never
run a business before.

15:41.627 --> 15:44.418
- No, and he's never
done anything in his life

15:44.418 --> 15:46.769
but be a lawyer and a soldier.

15:46.769 --> 15:47.716
That is it.

15:47.716 --> 15:49.220
- He may have won lots of battles,

15:49.220 --> 15:50.867
but he's fucking
definitely losing this way,

15:50.867 --> 15:51.837
let me tell you.

15:51.837 --> 15:55.184
- Finally, a stranger is
seeing what I've been seeing.

15:55.184 --> 15:58.302
And I'm hoping that John is
gonna take something from this

15:58.302 --> 16:00.407
and either we're gonna make it go,

16:00.407 --> 16:02.058
or we're gonna shut it up.

16:07.769 --> 16:10.126
- I've seen about as much as
I can stand at this hotel.

16:10.126 --> 16:12.806
The outdated rooms, the cheap linens,

16:12.806 --> 16:14.182
and the prepackaged food.

16:14.182 --> 16:16.174
How have things got this bad?

16:16.174 --> 16:18.363
I've got to get some answers.

16:18.363 --> 16:20.115
What's wrong with this
place and who's to blame?

16:20.115 --> 16:23.563
- The problems here is that we have to ask

16:23.563 --> 16:25.472
to do something.

16:25.472 --> 16:27.540
We're not aloud to make a decision,

16:27.540 --> 16:28.409
we're not aloud to make a decision.

16:28.409 --> 16:29.948
- General manager, executive chef.

16:29.948 --> 16:32.173
- We have to run everything through John.

16:32.173 --> 16:33.042
- What?

16:33.042 --> 16:34.849
- We have to have meetings.
- John's a lawyer.

16:34.849 --> 16:36.277
Why'd do you have to ask someone

16:36.277 --> 16:37.997
that doesn't know how
to run a fucking bath,

16:37.997 --> 16:39.202
let alone a hotel?

16:39.202 --> 16:40.939
- That's what he wants. But
he's took over more control,

16:40.939 --> 16:41.808
that's when I put up my hands.

16:41.808 --> 16:43.816
Okay, you wanna run it, you run it.

16:43.816 --> 16:45.660
- It's fucking soulless.

16:45.660 --> 16:48.791
It's littered with shit
antiques that are broken.

16:48.791 --> 16:50.750
It's got horrendous pictures

16:50.750 --> 16:52.272
all over the fucking place.

16:52.272 --> 16:56.246
Disgusting rooms, food that
comes out of a fucking bag.

16:56.246 --> 16:58.117
- I don't control any of that stuff.

16:58.117 --> 16:59.978
I'm not making decisions.

16:59.978 --> 17:02.734
I told Rich that I thought
we should cut our food costs.

17:03.898 --> 17:07.060
- Have you got the respect from the owners

17:07.060 --> 17:09.580
to do your job properly, yes or no?

17:09.580 --> 17:10.450
- No.

17:10.450 --> 17:11.740
- I have absolutely-

17:11.740 --> 17:13.155
- Can she talk?

17:13.155 --> 17:16.218
- I definitely do not make the decisions

17:16.218 --> 17:18.839
that I think I should be able to though.

17:18.839 --> 17:20.269
- She's telling you that,

17:20.269 --> 17:21.913
and that's what the problem is.

17:21.913 --> 17:24.522
It's not the fucking ghosts, John,

17:24.522 --> 17:29.278
that are scaring the
regulars away, it's you.

17:29.278 --> 17:31.454
A chef needs to be a fucking chef

17:31.454 --> 17:34.179
and the general manager
needs to general manage.

17:34.179 --> 17:36.285
- I'm not a micro-manager.

17:36.285 --> 17:40.248
- When we first started this
place and the ideas I had

17:40.248 --> 17:42.605
were all shot, shot down,

17:42.605 --> 17:44.262
that's the kind of stuff.

17:44.262 --> 17:45.916
- Now it's coming out.

17:45.916 --> 17:47.649
You've handicapped the chef,

17:47.649 --> 17:49.965
the general manager's dysfunctional,

17:49.965 --> 17:51.759
and you're calling all the fucking shots.

17:51.759 --> 17:54.397
- I'm not calling the shots.
- You're a lethal weapon.

17:54.397 --> 17:55.408
- You may think that-

17:55.408 --> 17:57.637
- No, I don't think that,
I fucking know that.

17:57.637 --> 17:59.256
You just heard from your wife,

17:59.256 --> 18:00.736
your general manager, your chef.

18:00.736 --> 18:01.605
- That I'm controlling?

18:01.605 --> 18:03.802
- Over controlling, you're
like a little fucking Hitler

18:03.802 --> 18:04.939
around here.

18:04.939 --> 18:08.059
And if you don't stop
doing what you're doing,

18:09.266 --> 18:12.814
you'll lose your family and the business.

18:12.814 --> 18:15.682
(dramatic music)

18:21.142 --> 18:23.384
I've finally got the truth
at the Cambridge Hotel.

18:23.384 --> 18:25.779
You're like a little
fucking Hitler around here.

18:25.779 --> 18:29.192
The place is sinking because
John the owner's meddling ways

18:29.192 --> 18:31.154
have made everyone's jobs impossible.

18:31.154 --> 18:32.904
- I'm not a micro-manager.

18:32.904 --> 18:35.173
- They're not puppets.

18:35.173 --> 18:38.441
They're your team and if you don't stop

18:38.441 --> 18:39.734
doing what you're doing,

18:39.734 --> 18:43.021
you'll lose your family and the business.

18:44.572 --> 18:46.800
Work it out, Your Honour.

18:46.800 --> 18:48.679
I'm going to bed.

18:48.679 --> 18:50.239
Goodnight.

18:50.239 --> 18:52.932
(Gordon sighs)

18:54.561 --> 18:58.158
- This is all stuff that I've
been trying to get across

18:58.158 --> 19:00.362
to John for 20 years.

19:02.291 --> 19:03.309
- What's the matter?

19:03.309 --> 19:05.739
(Tina groans)

19:05.739 --> 19:07.741
- What's the matter?

19:07.741 --> 19:08.846
Seriously?

19:08.846 --> 19:10.025
- Yeah.
- What's the matter?

19:10.025 --> 19:14.258
- With you, right now, you
have a headache again or?

19:14.258 --> 19:15.127
- I've had it.

19:16.897 --> 19:18.317
I have had it.

19:18.317 --> 19:20.236
I was feeling squashed.

19:20.236 --> 19:22.474
I don't have to feel that way anymore.

19:22.474 --> 19:24.351
I'm not gonna feel that way anymore.

19:25.342 --> 19:27.313
- Bedtime, and I'm not looking forward

19:27.313 --> 19:29.169
to sleeping in a haunted room.

19:29.169 --> 19:32.130
I've never seen such a delusional owner

19:32.130 --> 19:34.632
and staff that are so
desperate to do their jobs

19:35.540 --> 19:37.260
and now I've gotta sleep in this.

19:38.814 --> 19:39.776
Christ almighty.

19:40.952 --> 19:42.203
(bed bangs)

19:42.203 --> 19:44.538
Oh fuck, what was that?

19:45.894 --> 19:47.893
This bed is so uncomfy.

19:49.505 --> 19:51.231
What is that noise on the stairs?

19:51.231 --> 19:53.120
(girl giggles)

19:53.120 --> 19:53.988
Alice.

19:59.876 --> 20:02.389
I had a sleepless night and believe me,

20:02.389 --> 20:04.360
it wasn't a ghost that kept me awake.

20:04.360 --> 20:06.289
It was something far more frightening.

20:06.289 --> 20:09.042
Time to give John and Tina a wake up call.

20:09.042 --> 20:09.980
After you, please.

20:15.746 --> 20:17.157
- [Tina] Hi, guys.

20:17.157 --> 20:19.168
- [Guests] Hi.

20:19.168 --> 20:21.700
- These are the guests that
have been staying in the hotel.

20:21.700 --> 20:24.318
I've asked them in my room this morning

20:24.318 --> 20:27.592
to help you understand how difficult

20:27.592 --> 20:30.514
it has become for guests
to actually stay here.

20:30.514 --> 20:32.127
Who would like to go first?

20:32.127 --> 20:33.608
- I took a shower this morning

20:33.608 --> 20:35.777
and used what I thought was a clean towel,

20:35.777 --> 20:37.872
and there was hair in the towel.

20:37.872 --> 20:40.508
- The bed itself was
actually very uncomfortable.

20:40.508 --> 20:41.376
(guests agreeing)

20:41.376 --> 20:42.450
- And the pillows.

20:42.450 --> 20:43.743
- Yeah, we left our room last night

20:43.743 --> 20:44.838
and couldn't lock our door,

20:44.838 --> 20:48.039
so we had to leave our
hotel room door unlocked.

20:48.039 --> 20:48.908
- Hand on hearts,

20:48.908 --> 20:51.525
how many of you would return here?

20:51.525 --> 20:53.899
(guests disagreeing)

20:53.899 --> 20:55.000
Anyone?

20:55.000 --> 20:56.929
- Not unless you pay me to stay here.

20:58.101 --> 21:01.658
- John and Tina, are you
aware of so many problems

21:01.658 --> 21:03.157
inside these rooms?

21:03.157 --> 21:04.472
- Some of them we are aware of, yes.

21:04.472 --> 21:05.849
- [Tina] Some of then, yeah.

21:05.849 --> 21:10.812
- But what I'm more pissed
off about than anything

21:10.812 --> 21:15.570
is that last night, I went downstairs,

21:16.714 --> 21:19.237
in fact let me show, it's
easier if I do it this way.

21:19.237 --> 21:21.805
I forgot my toothbrush,
I went down to the car,

21:22.991 --> 21:24.722
and I cannot believe this.

21:24.722 --> 21:26.567
Just watch carefully.

21:26.567 --> 21:27.436
I went outside,

21:28.840 --> 21:30.741
so I stepped down the stairs,

21:32.354 --> 21:34.377
and all of a sudden, damn,
I've locked myself out,

21:34.377 --> 21:36.372
and I've got no keys to get back in.

21:40.863 --> 21:45.557
The bloody front door
is not locked at night.

21:45.557 --> 21:48.099
(guests conversing)

21:48.099 --> 21:50.350
Now there's no night porter,

21:50.350 --> 21:55.075
there's no security, and then shock horror

21:56.952 --> 21:58.933
I went behind the reception desk

21:58.933 --> 22:01.968
and every one of your keys is hanging,

22:01.968 --> 22:04.306
replicated, in the pigeon box.

22:05.868 --> 22:07.577
- Wow.
- That's terrible.

22:07.577 --> 22:08.995
(guests groaning)

22:08.995 --> 22:11.772
- Duplicate key for every room.

22:12.864 --> 22:15.158
Credit card details,
personal cell numbers,

22:15.158 --> 22:16.412
it's all there.

22:17.778 --> 22:19.297
- That's really scary.
- That's scary to think about.

22:19.297 --> 22:20.854
- Why is the door not locked?

22:23.791 --> 22:25.303
- There's no good reason.

22:25.303 --> 22:26.659
We haven't locked it in a long time, no.

22:26.659 --> 22:27.910
- No, about two years.

22:27.910 --> 22:31.403
- In this community, you've
had eight major burglaries

22:31.403 --> 22:33.030
in the last 12 months,

22:33.030 --> 22:37.590
three registered sex offenders
locally in this community.

22:37.590 --> 22:39.359
I mean, how does that make you feel

22:39.359 --> 22:42.679
that we were sleeping
in this hotel last night

22:42.679 --> 22:46.984
and each and every one
of us was vulnerable.

22:48.535 --> 22:50.672
- That's not okay.
- So irresponsible.

22:50.672 --> 22:52.153
- Thank you.
- Thank you, guys.

22:52.153 --> 22:53.164
Thank you all.

22:53.164 --> 22:54.371
- Can you stay here with me,

22:54.371 --> 22:56.248
and ladies and gentlemen, thank you.

22:57.752 --> 23:01.006
John and Tina have broken
the first law of hospitality.

23:01.006 --> 23:02.924
Keep your guests safe.

23:02.924 --> 23:05.257
John's so busy interfering
with other people's jobs,

23:05.257 --> 23:07.838
he's lost sight of what really matters.

23:09.274 --> 23:12.090
I'm not joking around on the burglaries.

23:12.090 --> 23:14.394
- Oh, I know.
- The sex offenders.

23:14.394 --> 23:17.063
Your reputation could be over in seconds

23:17.063 --> 23:18.610
on one instant in this hotel.

23:19.712 --> 23:22.339
Because you're not gonna
walk around this town

23:22.339 --> 23:24.698
as a prosecutor, a chief lawyer,

23:24.698 --> 23:28.408
and then be responsible for a serious rape

23:28.408 --> 23:30.309
taking place inside here.

23:31.609 --> 23:33.395
Wake up.

23:33.395 --> 23:37.191
You're running a
business, not a courtroom.

23:37.191 --> 23:39.228
And they're here for an experience,

23:39.228 --> 23:41.260
not a fucking sentence.

23:41.260 --> 23:45.404
Sell the place, 'cause
you're not fit to run it.

23:45.404 --> 23:48.472
Sell it, 'cause this is madness.

23:48.472 --> 23:51.914
Sell it, and keep your house.

23:52.835 --> 23:55.803
(Gordon sighs)

23:55.803 --> 23:58.670
(dramatic music)

24:07.885 --> 24:10.367
I've just discovered
that John has lost sight

24:10.367 --> 24:12.160
of the big picture at the hotel.

24:12.160 --> 24:17.155
The bloody front door
is not locked at night.

24:17.155 --> 24:19.907
And his incompetence is
putting the guests' safety

24:19.907 --> 24:20.804
in jeopardy.

24:20.804 --> 24:22.379
- That's not okay.

24:22.379 --> 24:24.464
- If John doesn't change
his interfering ways,

24:24.464 --> 24:26.925
he and Tina will lose their home

24:26.925 --> 24:29.271
and be forced to live in
the hotel's top floor.

24:29.271 --> 24:32.058
It's time to find out
what it's like up there.

24:33.433 --> 24:36.301
(dramatic music)

24:48.050 --> 24:50.417
Hello, anyone there?

24:50.417 --> 24:51.286
Hello?

24:53.264 --> 24:54.184
Oh, shit.

24:56.121 --> 24:56.989
Bloody hell.

24:58.225 --> 25:01.856
Who in the hell put this here?

25:01.856 --> 25:03.496
This really is Hotel Hell.

25:04.368 --> 25:07.322
Oh my god, what happened to her hands?

25:09.905 --> 25:12.943
This place is genuinely
disturbing, freaky.

25:13.917 --> 25:16.829
The top floor's no place to live,

25:16.829 --> 25:18.216
but I've got a plan.

25:18.216 --> 25:20.916
If I force John to see
different things could be here,

25:20.916 --> 25:22.637
maybe he'll get the message.

25:22.637 --> 25:24.587
So I'm gonna need Brittany's help.

25:24.587 --> 25:27.610
If we can prove to John and Tina,

25:27.610 --> 25:30.173
if you take charge and
you hold those reins,

25:30.173 --> 25:34.586
that you can make money
for this hotel, trust me,

25:34.586 --> 25:37.673
they back off and you step up, okay?

25:37.673 --> 25:39.675
- Yeah, absolutely, I hear you.

25:39.675 --> 25:43.282
I'm hoping to prove to
John that it can be busy,

25:43.282 --> 25:44.690
it can be fun here.

25:44.690 --> 25:47.936
Tonight, we are serving.

25:49.028 --> 25:51.259
We are doing a bar night.

25:51.259 --> 25:53.324
- Oh my god, this is terrible.

25:53.324 --> 25:58.537
We're not a rowdy, kids
doing shots, going crazy bar.

25:58.913 --> 26:01.780
- There's a party, party, party.

26:01.780 --> 26:02.990
We're gonna do drink specials.

26:02.990 --> 26:04.543
We can get people in the rooms.

26:04.543 --> 26:05.730
A ladies night tonight.

26:05.730 --> 26:07.796
Have to pack the place.

26:07.796 --> 26:08.686
Thanks, bye.

26:09.642 --> 26:11.842
This is the first step to change.

26:11.842 --> 26:13.667
- As last minute preparations take place

26:13.667 --> 26:14.908
in the bar and the kitchen,

26:14.908 --> 26:17.337
there's a new energy in the hotel.

26:17.337 --> 26:19.162
This is Chef Rich's chance to prove

26:19.162 --> 26:20.789
that he can cook with fresh ingredients,

26:20.789 --> 26:21.748
nothing out of a bag.

26:21.748 --> 26:23.367
Please, no preheated, all fresh, yeah?

26:23.367 --> 26:25.241
- All fresh.
- Great.

26:25.241 --> 26:28.046
Rich, it's your responsibility
to teach these guys

26:28.046 --> 26:29.203
how to cook.

26:29.203 --> 26:30.072
- Absolutely.

26:30.072 --> 26:30.940
- Not to reheat.

26:30.940 --> 26:31.809
Is that right, Scoot?

26:31.809 --> 26:32.678
Yeah.
- Absolutely.

26:32.678 --> 26:33.729
He's just out of culinary school.

26:33.729 --> 26:35.974
- Oh, good man. And who
inspired you to be a chef?

26:35.974 --> 26:38.254
- I had relatives everywhere pushing me

26:38.254 --> 26:39.568
to join the culinary field,

26:39.568 --> 26:42.122
because I wasn't physically able

26:42.122 --> 26:43.478
to do any other things,

26:43.478 --> 26:44.834
like sports and stuff.

26:44.834 --> 26:46.554
- What's the disability?

26:46.554 --> 26:50.236
- I've had two heart surgeries
and two back surgeries.

26:50.236 --> 26:51.191
- How old are you?

26:51.191 --> 26:52.059
- 19.

26:52.059 --> 26:53.960
- You move fast, that's a big asset.

26:53.960 --> 26:55.840
And you haven't been taught
properly yet, have you?

26:55.840 --> 26:57.794
- No.
- That's incredible.

26:57.794 --> 26:59.233
So what do you wanna be when you grow up?

26:59.233 --> 27:02.056
- I would like to have my own bakery

27:02.056 --> 27:05.031
and be a professional
executive pastry chef.

27:05.031 --> 27:05.899
- [Gordon] Wow.

27:05.899 --> 27:07.784
- [Rich] We're ready to roll.

27:07.784 --> 27:09.233
- [Gordon] Brittany
has gotten the word out

27:09.233 --> 27:10.860
that she's in charge tonight.

27:10.860 --> 27:13.247
And people are flocking in to the hotel.

27:13.247 --> 27:14.257
- There you go.

27:14.257 --> 27:16.073
Okay, let me ring them up.

27:16.073 --> 27:17.960
- Ladies night is going
really well tonight.

27:17.960 --> 27:20.513
There's a mixed crowd of ages here,

27:20.513 --> 27:23.414
and everyone hanging out
together and having fun.

27:23.414 --> 27:26.461
- What can I do to help you?
- Nothing, get out.

27:26.461 --> 27:27.329
Out!

27:28.502 --> 27:29.743
- Night's going great,

27:29.743 --> 27:31.870
but I don't think John quite understands

27:31.870 --> 27:33.319
how important nights like this are,

27:33.319 --> 27:36.148
because I don't think
this guy gets the message.

27:37.344 --> 27:41.818
John, I wanna show you
something, come with me.

27:47.093 --> 27:51.013
That thing spooks me
every time I come in here.

27:51.013 --> 27:52.958
Here's the situation.

27:52.958 --> 27:56.106
Downstairs, currently there is a buzz

27:56.106 --> 27:59.071
and that got put together by
your general manager, Brittany.

27:59.071 --> 28:03.777
That's her vision, but if you carry on

28:03.777 --> 28:07.604
running the Cambridge Hotel
the way you have been,

28:07.604 --> 28:08.834
this is what you're gonna have.

28:08.834 --> 28:12.732
This is what's your
destiny, this, on your own.

28:12.732 --> 28:17.252
So stay up and sort of
enjoy your surroundings.

28:19.960 --> 28:21.138
I'll come and get you when I'm ready.

28:21.138 --> 28:22.007
- All right.

28:27.485 --> 28:28.698
He's so wrong.

28:28.698 --> 28:32.566
He has no clue, and I'm
thinking when he comes back up

28:32.566 --> 28:33.557
he's gonna ask me what did I learn

28:33.557 --> 28:36.111
and I'm gonna say I really
didn't learn anything.

28:41.467 --> 28:43.205
It's locked, dammit.

28:46.946 --> 28:49.727
(woman screams)

28:50.563 --> 28:52.794
- [Gordon] I've locked John,
the hotel's interfering owner

28:52.794 --> 28:54.150
on the top floor.

28:54.150 --> 28:55.224
I need to demonstrate to him

28:55.224 --> 28:57.799
how well the hotel can run without him.

28:57.799 --> 28:59.624
- I'm not happy sitting there waiting,

28:59.624 --> 29:01.555
because I know my guests are downstairs

29:01.555 --> 29:05.432
having a party and I kind
of felt that I needed

29:05.432 --> 29:06.753
to be downstairs.

29:06.753 --> 29:09.165
Gordon wants me to sit up here

29:09.165 --> 29:12.241
and think that he's all
right about this stuff

29:12.241 --> 29:16.123
and dammit, he's wrong about
me being a control freak.

29:19.853 --> 29:21.813
- [Gordon] With ladies
night in full swing,

29:21.813 --> 29:25.348
Chef's fiancee and John
and Tina's daughter, Shea

29:25.348 --> 29:27.107
arrives to join in the fun.

29:27.107 --> 29:28.376
- Hey!
- Hi, Momma.

29:28.376 --> 29:31.333
- I think she's my last chance
of getting through to John.

29:31.333 --> 29:32.863
Hi, Shea, how are you?

29:32.863 --> 29:34.007
Have you got one minute, 30 seconds?

29:34.007 --> 29:35.832
Excuse me, thank you.

29:37.195 --> 29:38.830
Time's running out for you dad

29:38.830 --> 29:42.208
and for your mother, and for their house.

29:42.208 --> 29:44.002
I can't get through to your father.

29:44.002 --> 29:45.524
I asked him to go upstairs

29:45.524 --> 29:47.599
and just sit and ponder and think

29:47.599 --> 29:49.007
that this is your future.

29:49.007 --> 29:51.728
And if you think he's ready to change,

29:51.728 --> 29:52.792
by all means, bring him down,

29:52.792 --> 29:54.867
and if he's not, I don't care.

29:54.867 --> 29:57.310
Keep him out of there
and keep him up there.

30:00.044 --> 30:01.373
- Hey, Pops.
- Hey, Shea.

30:01.373 --> 30:03.417
- [Shea] What's going on?

30:03.417 --> 30:08.495
- I'm just up here
sitting down and waiting.

30:08.495 --> 30:09.365
- Waiting?

30:09.365 --> 30:11.450
- To go back downstairs.

30:12.551 --> 30:17.371
- I think the point was
to try and visualise

30:17.371 --> 30:22.412
what could potentially be the future.

30:22.412 --> 30:24.988
- Oh, no, I've been doing
a lot of thinking too.

30:24.988 --> 30:27.534
Yeah, I've been doing a lot of thinking.

30:27.534 --> 30:30.333
I thought my role was
about the same all along.

30:31.883 --> 30:34.177
- I feel like it's changed a lot.

30:34.177 --> 30:39.310
And I think a lot of it
is a fear of trusting.

30:41.820 --> 30:44.521
You don't have to be here all the time.

30:44.521 --> 30:46.210
When was the last time
you say down at home

30:46.210 --> 30:47.930
and had a dinner with Mom, you know?

30:47.930 --> 30:50.227
- Yeah, I feel guilty when I'm not here.

30:51.330 --> 30:54.085
- Do you know what's going on downstairs?

30:55.000 --> 30:56.220
- No.

30:56.220 --> 30:57.117
- It's awesome.

30:57.117 --> 31:01.146
There is a restaurant full of people

31:01.146 --> 31:04.376
that are thoroughly enjoying themselves.

31:04.376 --> 31:05.378
It's hopping.

31:06.851 --> 31:09.327
And it's working without you.

31:09.327 --> 31:12.872
- Yeah, yeah, I'm getting it, okay?

31:12.872 --> 31:16.031
I mean, it's gonna be tough for me

31:16.031 --> 31:17.202
to back off of the working.

31:17.202 --> 31:19.702
- I think it's important for you.

31:19.702 --> 31:21.980
I think it's important for you and Mom.

31:21.980 --> 31:24.352
- You know, you make a good point, Shea.

31:24.352 --> 31:25.322
- I think you would be able

31:25.322 --> 31:27.251
to spend more time with
your granddaughter.

31:27.251 --> 31:28.505
- Oh, I'd love that.

31:31.347 --> 31:32.697
- It's possible.

31:35.265 --> 31:37.587
You don't want this to be your future.

31:37.587 --> 31:38.456
- No.

31:38.456 --> 31:39.324
- [Shea] You don't wanna live here.

31:39.324 --> 31:40.358
- No, I don't.

31:40.358 --> 31:41.911
- You have to commit to change.

31:41.911 --> 31:44.903
- Yeah, yeah, I understand.

31:44.903 --> 31:47.451
If Mom will put up with
me being home more.

31:49.819 --> 31:51.977
- Love you.
- I love you too, Shea.

31:57.225 --> 31:58.418
It's an epiphany.

31:58.418 --> 32:01.452
I've just now realised my control

32:01.452 --> 32:03.775
is what's dragging the hotel down.

32:03.775 --> 32:07.875
Now I need to make a change
in order for my personal life

32:07.875 --> 32:10.777
to improve and for my
business to get better.

32:11.835 --> 32:13.818
- Good job, you're doing great.

32:13.818 --> 32:14.861
- Thank you, thanks.

32:16.112 --> 32:18.375
- Tonight has been a real success.

32:18.375 --> 32:20.721
Seeing Brittany in charge
and Rich cooking fresh food

32:20.721 --> 32:22.087
gives me real hope.

32:22.087 --> 32:23.925
But is John capable of letting go?

32:24.965 --> 32:26.279
My goodness, it feels weird,

32:26.279 --> 32:27.502
it's sounding so quiet now, right?

32:27.502 --> 32:30.387
All right, well done, behind the bar,

32:30.387 --> 32:32.865
well done in the kitchen,
Scooter, well done.

32:32.865 --> 32:36.706
Ladies, great, I mean you
couldn't get a seat at the bar

32:36.706 --> 32:38.072
within 20 minutes.

32:38.072 --> 32:39.308
That's how it should be.

32:39.308 --> 32:40.667
How much did we take?

32:40.667 --> 32:43.157
- Just under $1,400 in two hours.

32:43.157 --> 32:45.329
- $1,400.

32:45.329 --> 32:50.543
- In two hours we made more
than the last four Wednesdays

32:51.325 --> 32:53.190
or four Thursdays combined.

32:53.190 --> 32:55.589
- John, you spent the majority
of the night upstairs,

32:55.589 --> 32:56.851
how was your night?

32:56.851 --> 32:59.284
- It was a very good night, actually.

33:00.315 --> 33:01.773
- In what way?

33:01.773 --> 33:05.276
- My daughter Shea opened
my eyes to some things.

33:05.276 --> 33:08.966
I'm here every night because
I feel that I need to be here.

33:08.966 --> 33:13.640
That that is my role as
the owner to wave the flag

33:13.640 --> 33:15.074
as a military term.

33:15.074 --> 33:17.809
But when it came from Shea,

33:17.809 --> 33:19.217
and she said, you know Dad,

33:20.604 --> 33:21.855
I know how hard you work,

33:21.855 --> 33:23.988
and I promised I wasn't gonna tear up,

33:23.988 --> 33:27.507
and this all happened without me,

33:27.507 --> 33:30.770
you trust your subordinates.

33:30.770 --> 33:33.085
As a commander, the most important person

33:33.085 --> 33:35.212
you have are you NCOs,

33:35.212 --> 33:38.253
and Chef and Brittany are my NCOs.

33:38.253 --> 33:40.316
- I can't tell you how
good it is to hear that

33:40.316 --> 33:42.796
'cause you're a fucking
tough nut to crack.

33:42.796 --> 33:44.670
(group laughing)

33:44.670 --> 33:48.048
'Cause we have got one
hell of a day tomorrow.

33:48.048 --> 33:51.187
But I need everybody,
everybody at their best.

33:51.187 --> 33:53.743
All right, good job, well done.

33:53.743 --> 33:56.330
- Great job, Britt.
- Thank you.

33:59.301 --> 34:00.880
- What a day.

34:00.880 --> 34:03.251
I'm hoping that John has
finally got that message,

34:03.251 --> 34:05.072
but is it all lawyer crap?

34:05.072 --> 34:07.189
Tomorrow we'll definitely find out.

34:12.710 --> 34:14.621
Oh god, it's freezing.

34:16.326 --> 34:18.777
Coming up, I drag the Cambridge Hotel

34:18.777 --> 34:20.549
into the 21st century

34:20.549 --> 34:23.587
and one of the hotel staff
gets some shocking news.

34:29.402 --> 34:31.081
My design team worked all night

34:31.081 --> 34:33.245
to bring the hotel into the 21st century.

34:33.245 --> 34:35.877
Now it's time to reveal
the new Cambridge Hotel

34:35.877 --> 34:37.190
to the staff.

34:37.190 --> 34:38.139
Good morning.

34:38.139 --> 34:40.176
- [John] Good morning.
- John, how are you feeling?

34:40.176 --> 34:41.748
- I can't wait to see
what you've done in there.

34:41.748 --> 34:42.933
- Right, you ready to go in?

34:42.933 --> 34:43.802
- Yes!

34:43.802 --> 34:46.408
- The only way we're getting
in is with this, a key.

34:46.408 --> 34:47.618
Let's go.

34:47.618 --> 34:49.172
Let's go.

34:49.172 --> 34:51.679
The door is locked so
your guests can sleep

34:51.679 --> 34:53.676
safe and sound.

34:53.676 --> 34:55.114
Come on.
- Unlocks, good, good.

34:55.114 --> 34:58.358
- All right, come on upstairs.

34:58.358 --> 35:00.825
I'm hoping that you'll love my room.

35:00.825 --> 35:03.053
I think it's absolutely gorgeous.

35:05.274 --> 35:07.672
- Oh my god, look at the floor.

35:08.948 --> 35:11.567
Taking the carpet out and
putting the flooring in

35:11.567 --> 35:14.270
absolutely transformed it.

35:14.270 --> 35:16.094
- The wallpaper was expensive.

35:16.094 --> 35:18.910
In order to enhance it, we worked with it.

35:18.910 --> 35:21.694
So we got the back drapes above the bed,

35:21.694 --> 35:23.639
we have this amazing new floor,

35:23.639 --> 35:26.773
perfect furniture that fits the room.

35:26.773 --> 35:31.986
We've upgraded every room with
brand new linen and towels.

35:32.378 --> 35:34.695
$75,000 worth of linen.

35:34.695 --> 35:37.543
- Oh my god.

35:37.543 --> 35:39.107
- We could have never afforded that,

35:39.107 --> 35:40.442
that is so wonderful.

35:40.442 --> 35:42.882
I feel kind of like a kid that
comes down Christmas morning

35:42.882 --> 35:44.815
and there's so many things under the tree

35:44.815 --> 35:47.782
that you're in overload.

35:47.782 --> 35:50.441
I can't really comprehend everything yet.

35:50.441 --> 35:52.892
I mean, I'm just kind of
looking at saying wow.

35:54.268 --> 35:55.582
- [Gordon] Ready for one more room?

35:55.582 --> 35:57.792
- [Tina] Oh my god, I don't
know if I can take it.

35:57.792 --> 35:59.393
- Wow.

35:59.393 --> 36:00.261
Wow.

36:03.141 --> 36:07.354
- I can't wait to actually show
a guest upstairs to a room.

36:07.354 --> 36:09.720
I love it.
- I love it, I love it.

36:09.720 --> 36:11.243
- There's one more little thing

36:11.243 --> 36:13.652
I wanna show you downstairs,
come with me, please.

36:13.652 --> 36:16.415
In the 1890s, the
Cambridge Hotel gave birth

36:16.415 --> 36:18.579
to would famous pie a la mode.

36:18.579 --> 36:20.294
And I think that dish can put the hotel

36:20.294 --> 36:21.848
back on the map today.

36:21.848 --> 36:25.444
Something I thought was
a huge miss opportunity,

36:25.444 --> 36:29.095
I've been working on an
amazing, very special

36:29.095 --> 36:31.545
apple pie recipe that
I'm gonna give to you,

36:31.545 --> 36:35.038
that you own, and it becomes
the best apple pie in America.

36:35.038 --> 36:37.082
And on the back of that,

36:37.082 --> 36:40.261
we've transformed this room through here

36:40.261 --> 36:42.118
to the A La Mode Room.

36:42.118 --> 36:42.986
Come through.

36:44.182 --> 36:46.160
Morning, everybody, how are we?

36:46.160 --> 36:48.110
(guests conversing)

36:48.110 --> 36:49.459
(Tina gasps)

36:49.459 --> 36:53.264
- We can sell our own pie that's homemade,

36:53.264 --> 36:58.317
that Gordon is giving his
recipe for, oh my god.

36:58.317 --> 37:01.463
- This hotel invented pie a la mode,

37:02.534 --> 37:05.179
and the ice cream is made fresh here

37:05.179 --> 37:07.351
with a brand new ice cream maker

37:07.351 --> 37:10.688
and it's locally sourced cream.

37:10.688 --> 37:12.526
- [Brittany] I can't wait to try it.

37:13.639 --> 37:14.508
- Come with me, please.

37:14.508 --> 37:16.672
Enjoy the apple pie, nice to see you.

37:16.672 --> 37:18.321
Please, come through.

37:18.321 --> 37:21.028
Beautiful pie a la mode.

37:21.028 --> 37:23.367
Dig in, dig, in, come on, guys.

37:23.367 --> 37:26.131
- [Tina] If anybody wants
this, you better get on it.

37:27.709 --> 37:29.655
- Oh my god, that's awesome.

37:29.655 --> 37:31.407
- [Gordon] The world
famous Cambridge Hotel

37:31.407 --> 37:33.289
Apple Pie A La Mode.

37:33.289 --> 37:36.612
- That is the best crust
I have ever had on a pie.

37:36.612 --> 37:38.704
- Welcome to the Cambridge Hotel,

37:38.704 --> 37:43.283
we now have the best
apple pie a la mode in,

37:43.283 --> 37:44.847
I'd say the world.

37:44.847 --> 37:46.112
- People are gonna be excited.

37:47.058 --> 37:48.999
- Scoot, what do you think, bud?

37:48.999 --> 37:50.039
- I'm shocked.

37:50.039 --> 37:50.907
- You're shocked?

37:50.907 --> 37:52.167
Are you happy?

37:52.167 --> 37:53.304
- I don't know what to say.

37:53.304 --> 37:56.112
- Don't get upset,
buddy, what's the matter?

37:56.112 --> 37:56.980
- I'm so happy.

37:56.980 --> 38:00.676
- Oh good, I'm happy too as
well, you know that, okay.

38:00.676 --> 38:01.697
Come on, buddy.
- Thank you.

38:01.697 --> 38:03.418
Seeing how much he changed the hotel

38:03.418 --> 38:05.212
was very overwhelming.

38:05.212 --> 38:06.901
I can feel a change.

38:06.901 --> 38:08.579
I'm a lot more inspired.

38:08.579 --> 38:10.300
Right now I feel like I
can accomplish anything

38:10.300 --> 38:11.168
in the kitchen.

38:12.327 --> 38:14.836
- I am proud now.

38:14.836 --> 38:19.639
There's a new pride in me
to say this is where I work.

38:23.814 --> 38:26.253
- Time to go. I never thought I'd say this

38:26.253 --> 38:27.869
but I'm actually quite
sad to leave this place,

38:27.869 --> 38:30.808
because no longer is John in denial.

38:30.808 --> 38:33.644
He can now stand back and watch his team

38:33.644 --> 38:35.860
run the Cambridge properly.

38:38.119 --> 38:39.795
As I'm getting ready to leave,

38:39.795 --> 38:43.062
guests are starting to
arrive at the new hotel.

38:43.062 --> 38:45.113
- Hello, welcome guys, how are you?

38:45.113 --> 38:46.826
- [Gordon] And the biggest change of all

38:46.826 --> 38:48.265
is not the decor,

38:48.265 --> 38:51.219
it's the fact that guests are
loving it at the Cambridge.

38:52.422 --> 38:53.794
- This is beautiful.

38:55.272 --> 38:57.044
- [Gordon] The restaurant is buzzing.

38:57.044 --> 38:59.797
- The Cambridge burger
with the pork belly.

38:59.797 --> 39:01.212
- [Gordon] Guests are enjoying
the new home cooked menu

39:01.212 --> 39:03.395
that I put together with Chef Rich.

39:03.395 --> 39:04.263
- Real good.

39:04.263 --> 39:05.758
- It's good, yeah.

39:05.758 --> 39:07.503
- And you better save room for the pie

39:07.503 --> 39:08.856
'cause it's totally different.

39:08.856 --> 39:10.649
- Who's trying the apple pie?

39:10.649 --> 39:12.591
- [Gordon] And the hotel's signature dish,

39:12.591 --> 39:14.413
pie a la mode, is a big hit.

39:14.413 --> 39:17.175
- That ice cream is worth driving for.

39:17.175 --> 39:18.204
- Fantastic.

39:19.127 --> 39:20.620
- Great buzz in there.

39:20.620 --> 39:22.862
I mean, it's electric and it's the sound

39:22.862 --> 39:23.790
of the new Cambridge Hotel.

39:23.790 --> 39:25.260
My only hope now is that they keep it up

39:25.260 --> 39:27.526
and keep those customers excited.

39:27.526 --> 39:29.851
'Cause when it's like
that, it's phenomenal.

39:31.757 --> 39:33.632
- Is that good?

39:33.632 --> 39:34.780
Can I have a bite?

39:34.780 --> 39:36.813
I think tonight went incredibly well.

39:36.813 --> 39:41.474
The fact that I could stay
and sit with Shea and Addison.

39:41.474 --> 39:42.453
Bonk.

39:42.453 --> 39:43.424
(Addison laughs)

39:43.424 --> 39:46.545
It was really, really nice.

39:49.034 --> 39:50.064
- Wow.

39:50.064 --> 39:52.628
To see you smiling is incredible.

39:52.628 --> 39:53.559
You know that?
- Yeah.

39:53.559 --> 39:54.821
- You light this place up.

39:54.821 --> 39:56.333
But I don't want you living here.

39:56.333 --> 39:57.532
- No, I don't wanna live here.

39:57.532 --> 39:58.816
- I do not want you living here.

39:58.816 --> 39:59.684
- I won't live here.

39:59.684 --> 40:01.272
- [Gordon] Okay, tell him that.

40:01.272 --> 40:02.370
- I'm not living here.

40:02.370 --> 40:03.267
- [John] I hear you.

40:03.267 --> 40:04.897
- Give him a hug, he deserves one.

40:06.009 --> 40:07.643
He hasn't interfered tonight.

40:07.643 --> 40:10.128
And you sat down and spent
time with your granddaughter.

40:10.128 --> 40:11.519
- I had a blast.

40:11.519 --> 40:12.829
- My job is done.

40:12.829 --> 40:18.042
Let me tell you, no longer
R.I.P of the Cambridge.

40:19.304 --> 40:20.597
It has a bright future.

40:20.597 --> 40:22.839
Long live the Cambridge, right?

40:22.839 --> 40:24.547
- [Tina] Long live,
that's absolutely right.

40:24.547 --> 40:25.415
- Goodnight, my darling.

40:25.415 --> 40:28.396
- Before Gordon came, I didn't
know where to go anymore

40:28.396 --> 40:29.627
with the hotel.

40:29.627 --> 40:33.437
And getting Gordon here
and having him show us

40:33.437 --> 40:35.580
what the problem was,

40:35.580 --> 40:39.345
now I can see that things can be fixed.

40:39.345 --> 40:40.575
- I will tell you,

40:40.575 --> 40:45.212
Colin Powell says, "Optimism
is a force multiplier."

40:46.341 --> 40:47.759
I'm optimistic.

40:47.759 --> 40:48.750
- Stay optimistic,

40:48.750 --> 40:50.408
but don't get too involved, okay?

40:50.408 --> 40:51.448
- Okay.

40:51.448 --> 40:52.525
- [Gordon] Look after yourselves.

40:52.525 --> 40:53.515
- Thank you very much.

40:53.515 --> 40:54.401
- Stay together.

40:54.401 --> 40:56.341
- Thank you, thank you, thank you.

40:56.341 --> 40:57.565
- Before I leave this place,

40:57.565 --> 41:00.074
there's one more person I want to talk to.

41:00.074 --> 41:01.753
Well done, big man.

41:01.753 --> 41:04.901
So you've got three more
years left at college, right?

41:04.901 --> 41:05.770
- About four.

41:05.770 --> 41:07.394
- Okay, hear me out, okay?

41:07.394 --> 41:09.041
I want you to keep in touch with me.

41:09.041 --> 41:09.910
- [Scooter] Okay.

41:09.910 --> 41:11.001
- I'll give you my email address,

41:11.001 --> 41:12.659
'cause I want to finance
those next four years

41:12.659 --> 41:15.965
in college personally and help you, okay?

41:15.965 --> 41:18.279
Do it for you and keep that dream alive

41:18.279 --> 41:20.500
one day of owning your bakery,

41:20.500 --> 41:22.190
and then when you're bakery's open,

41:22.190 --> 41:24.971
all I want back is loaf of bread, okay?

41:24.971 --> 41:26.798
- It's pretty unbelievable

41:26.798 --> 41:30.558
that he's gonna be able to
finance my four years of school.

41:30.558 --> 41:32.355
- Well done, good job.

41:32.355 --> 41:34.705
- Thank you so much.
- Well done.

41:34.705 --> 41:36.735
- I can't wait to finish school

41:36.735 --> 41:39.655
and pay him off with
that big loaf of bread.

41:39.655 --> 41:41.876
- You have an amazing pair of hands,

41:41.876 --> 41:45.275
and I love your smile, don't stop, okay?

41:45.275 --> 41:47.932
And God help you if you fail that college.

41:47.932 --> 41:48.801
- Thank you.

41:48.801 --> 41:51.041
- You won't though, I
know you won't, well done.

41:51.041 --> 41:51.910
- Thank you so much.

41:51.910 --> 41:56.224
When I go to school, I'm gonna
push myself 200 times harder.

41:56.224 --> 41:57.861
I'm gonna show Gordon what I can do

41:57.861 --> 41:59.331
and how fast I can do it.

41:59.331 --> 42:01.346
- Good night, well done.

42:01.346 --> 42:02.215
Take care.
- Thank you.

42:02.215 --> 42:03.405
- Well done.
- Thank you.

42:04.367 --> 42:05.462
- Good job, man.

42:05.462 --> 42:06.331
Awesome job.

42:06.331 --> 42:09.949
- Hey, you deserve it.
- Definitely.

42:10.879 --> 42:13.786
- What a week, what a place.

42:15.868 --> 42:18.968
Now whenever I see a la mode,
I know where it started.

42:51.936 --> 42:53.552
- [Girl] One Potato Two Potato.
