00:48.165 --> 00:49.033
Dammit!

00:55.306 --> 00:56.639
I'll start again.

00:58.409 --> 01:00.211
Start from the top.

01:00.244 --> 01:01.112
Right.

01:11.855 --> 01:13.723
Ms. Lamb.

01:16.293 --> 01:17.128
What?

01:18.628 --> 01:20.264
Well, spit it out.

01:20.297 --> 01:21.499
We're collecting for charity.

01:21.531 --> 01:22.400
Good for you.

01:22.433 --> 01:23.700
It's to help the aged.

01:23.733 --> 01:25.735
You know how you
can help the aged?

01:25.769 --> 01:26.836
You can bugger off.

02:11.282 --> 02:12.450
Come on.

02:12.483 --> 02:14.617
Let's go.

02:14.651 --> 02:15.486
Well, let me see.

02:15.519 --> 02:16.187
A map.

02:16.220 --> 02:18.522
Oh, look, Nazi spy, right there.

02:18.556 --> 02:19.356
Follow me.

02:25.162 --> 02:26.696
Oi.

02:26.729 --> 02:27.797
Go, go, go.

02:27.831 --> 02:29.366
Come on, quick!

02:29.400 --> 02:30.267
Oi!

02:31.368 --> 02:32.570
Nazi witch.

02:43.581 --> 02:44.714
Oh, Ms. Lam.

02:45.782 --> 02:47.451
Ms. Lam.

02:47.485 --> 02:49.386
It's the WVS meeting tonight.

02:49.420 --> 02:50.887
Can I count you in?

02:53.690 --> 02:54.757
Unbelievable.

03:02.600 --> 03:03.534
Oh, Lord.

03:11.475 --> 03:13.843
I will go to the police.

03:13.877 --> 03:14.744
They're just children.

03:14.777 --> 03:17.181
Or buy a shotgun.
Oh, please, Ms. Lam.

03:17.214 --> 03:17.847
It's my property!

03:17.881 --> 03:19.183
I won't have it!

03:19.216 --> 03:21.218
Perhaps if you
didn't provoke them.

03:26.290 --> 03:27.158
Ms. Lam!

03:28.758 --> 03:29.627
Ms. Lam!

03:30.528 --> 03:32.896
Upon the heat and
flame of thy distemper

03:32.929 --> 03:35.299
sprinkle cool patience
what's that?

03:35.332 --> 03:37.635
sir, as the bard said.

03:37.700 --> 03:38.935
Shakespeare didn't have to deal

03:38.969 --> 03:40.837
with Alice Lam, though, did he?

03:40.870 --> 03:41.704
Or he might have said,

03:41.738 --> 03:44.241
"Get thee under the
table and hide."

04:06.497 --> 04:08.566
Oh, no, darling, not today.

04:08.599 --> 04:09.732
I want it.

04:09.766 --> 04:11.935
We don't have enough coupons
for chocolate, sweetheart.

04:11.969 --> 04:12.902
You'll have to wait
till next week.

04:12.936 --> 04:14.605
That's right, we've
all got to do our bit.

04:14.638 --> 04:16.406
Can't I just have a little bit?

04:16.440 --> 04:18.341
You couldn't let us just
this once, could you, Mew?

04:18.375 --> 04:19.742
I'm sorry, I wish I could.

04:19.776 --> 04:22.580
I'll have a packet of Westerly.

04:34.692 --> 04:35.559
And this.

04:37.061 --> 04:39.430
That is so kind.

04:39.463 --> 04:40.998
What do you say to
the nice lady, Martha?

04:41.031 --> 04:42.832
That's two coupons.

05:23.440 --> 05:24.841
Ms. Lam!

05:28.012 --> 05:29.879
What?

05:29.912 --> 05:31.348
We were expecting
you an hour ago.

05:31.382 --> 05:32.182
Sorry?

05:32.216 --> 05:33.916
The others were
met at the station.

05:33.951 --> 05:35.785
Fancy leaving poor
Frank on his own.

05:35.818 --> 05:36.654
Frank?

05:36.687 --> 05:37.554
Frank!

05:41.091 --> 05:44.361
This is Ms. Lam,
your new guardian.

05:44.395 --> 05:45.029
There's been a mistake.

05:45.062 --> 05:45.696
No.

05:45.729 --> 05:46.863
You've got the wrong house.

05:46.896 --> 05:48.032
Alice Lam, Dune Cottage.

05:48.065 --> 05:48.898
Yes, but...

05:48.931 --> 05:49.767
In you go, Frank.

05:49.799 --> 05:50.634
No, you don't.

05:50.668 --> 05:51.502
I don't want him.

05:51.535 --> 05:52.636
You can't refuse.

05:52.670 --> 05:53.737
You had a letter.

05:53.771 --> 05:54.972
No, I didn't.

05:55.005 --> 05:56.473
You must have.

06:19.963 --> 06:21.098
What did I tell you?

06:21.131 --> 06:22.132
We've all got to do our bit.

06:22.166 --> 06:23.534
So you take him, I'm working.

06:23.567 --> 06:25.436
I have four of my own.

06:25.469 --> 06:26.270
More for you.

06:26.303 --> 06:27.671
You should have
been more careful.

06:27.705 --> 06:28.806
Get inside.

06:28.838 --> 06:29.939
Go on.

06:29.973 --> 06:30.974
Get out!

06:31.008 --> 06:31.908
No you don't!

06:31.941 --> 06:33.410
Oh, for pity's sake.

06:33.444 --> 06:35.512
We're struggling enough
to find families.

06:35.546 --> 06:37.147
I'll need at least a week
to find him somewhere else.

06:37.181 --> 06:37.847
You'll have to
take him till then.

06:37.880 --> 06:39.083
I'm in the middle of a draft.

06:39.116 --> 06:41.952
And if you really can't find
it in your heart to keep him,

06:41.985 --> 06:43.487
then bring him to
the school next week,

06:43.520 --> 06:44.154
and we'll have to
make arrangements.

06:44.188 --> 06:45.022
But...

06:45.055 --> 06:46.856
A week, that's all.

06:49.560 --> 06:50.761
I'm sorry, son.

07:44.047 --> 07:46.683
You're touching my things.

07:46.717 --> 07:48.452
Don't touch my things.

07:48.485 --> 07:49.153
I'm not.

07:51.088 --> 07:53.957
Do you think you're funny?

07:53.991 --> 07:55.726
What's for dinner?

08:04.735 --> 08:07.738
You don't expect me
to cook it for you.

08:07.771 --> 08:09.606
There's the stove.

08:21.018 --> 08:22.152
Need anything?

08:23.687 --> 08:25.489
I always had milk
before bedtime.

08:25.522 --> 08:26.723
Good for you.

08:26.757 --> 08:27.591
Bathroom's there.

08:27.624 --> 08:29.493
Don't touch my creams.

08:47.611 --> 08:49.213
It's my dad's.

08:49.246 --> 08:50.514
Pilot, is he?

08:50.547 --> 08:52.516
In 21 Squadron.

08:52.549 --> 08:53.984
Do you like planes?

08:54.017 --> 08:55.853
I hate them.

08:55.886 --> 08:57.821
They murder my sleep.

08:57.855 --> 08:59.723
He's got two medals.

09:16.640 --> 09:17.508
What?

09:18.909 --> 09:20.177
I'm supposed to go to school.

09:20.210 --> 09:21.879
Well, go on then.

09:23.680 --> 09:25.015
Where is it?

09:25.048 --> 09:26.817
I could not go to school.

09:26.850 --> 09:28.085
I wouldn't mind.

09:28.118 --> 09:31.121
You can't be stupid
all your life.

09:34.358 --> 09:35.692
Don't.

09:35.726 --> 09:36.860
Sorry.

09:38.195 --> 09:39.062
Ms. Lam.

09:40.297 --> 09:42.065
What a pleasure to
see you again so soon.

09:42.099 --> 09:43.901
I want to give him back.

09:43.934 --> 09:46.103
Welcome to Saint
Nicholas, my boy,

09:46.136 --> 09:47.771
best school in the country.

09:47.804 --> 09:49.239
You'll be in Class Two.

09:49.273 --> 09:50.274
Ms. Poskitt?

09:51.375 --> 09:53.944
Why don't you come with me?

09:54.845 --> 09:55.812
Go on then.

09:55.846 --> 09:57.714
No one likes a coward.

10:01.184 --> 10:04.087
I do hope he's settling in.
When can I get rid of him?

10:04.121 --> 10:05.756
It's going to be
terribly difficult

10:05.789 --> 10:06.490
to find him somewhere else.

10:06.523 --> 10:07.558
Then you'd better start trying.

10:07.591 --> 10:11.295
Listen, I know you're
busy writing your stories.

10:11.328 --> 10:12.930
Academic theses.

10:13.897 --> 10:16.667
Just wonder whether
you might try.

10:16.700 --> 10:20.304
He could end up further
away from his mother!

10:24.107 --> 10:25.275
This is Frank.

10:25.309 --> 10:27.778
He's an evacuee from London.

10:30.213 --> 10:33.750
Why don't we find
you somewhere to sit?

10:34.953 --> 10:38.755
Here, next to Edie when
she deigns to arrive.

10:40.657 --> 10:42.392
Edie Corey, one more late,

10:42.426 --> 10:44.127
and I'll keep you after school!

10:44.161 --> 10:45.729
Be good, Class Two.

10:45.762 --> 10:46.830
Mrs. Bassett.

10:48.165 --> 10:49.968
This is Frank.

10:50.001 --> 10:51.635
You can be partners.

10:51.668 --> 10:52.936
Be nice, please.

11:11.388 --> 11:12.389
I don't believe in partners.

11:12.422 --> 11:14.691
Spelling books out.

11:15.459 --> 11:16.293
Frank, you can share with Edie.

11:16.326 --> 11:17.761
Or sharing.

11:17.794 --> 11:18.662
Why not?

11:19.463 --> 11:21.298
I'm an individualist.

11:23.734 --> 11:25.736
It's a person who shows
independence of thought

11:25.769 --> 11:26.837
and, or action...

11:26.870 --> 11:27.704
Bristle.

11:27.738 --> 11:28.672
I'm a maverick.

11:28.705 --> 11:29.339
Hustle.

11:29.373 --> 11:30.774
I just got told to sit here.

11:30.807 --> 11:32.110
Mavericks don't follow rules.

11:32.142 --> 11:33.410
Biscuit.

11:33.443 --> 11:34.811
We're free thinkers.

11:34.845 --> 11:37.115
Edie Corey, spelling list.

11:38.849 --> 11:40.417
Crumbs, biscuit, tea...

11:40.450 --> 11:41.284
What?

12:38.408 --> 12:41.778
This seat is free, isn't it?

12:41.812 --> 12:43.847
You get stood up too?

12:43.880 --> 12:47.517
Actually, I came on my own.

12:47.551 --> 12:49.954
Well, not anymore.

12:52.522 --> 12:53.857
Vera Wellbond.

12:54.992 --> 12:57.527
How do you do?

13:23.920 --> 13:24.888
What's that?

13:24.921 --> 13:25.889
A secret.

13:25.922 --> 13:26.757
Show me.

13:26.790 --> 13:27.457
No.

13:28.558 --> 13:30.427
What will you give me?

13:31.328 --> 13:32.196
Show you up my skirt.

13:32.230 --> 13:33.463
No, thanks.

13:33.497 --> 13:35.432
Wouldn't have anyway.

13:36.466 --> 13:37.567
Who are you staying with?

13:37.601 --> 13:40.303
A lady, but only for a week.

13:40.337 --> 13:41.404
Then I have to move.

13:41.438 --> 13:42.272
Why?

13:42.305 --> 13:43.141
Did you do something bad?

13:43.174 --> 13:44.041
No.

13:45.442 --> 13:47.377
Still, least you escaped.

13:47.410 --> 13:49.147
You're 14 times more
likely to be bombed

13:49.180 --> 13:50.480
in London than anywhere,

13:50.514 --> 13:52.849
and even if you don't die,
it can burn your skin off

13:52.883 --> 13:54.317
so you don't have
eyelids anymore.

13:54.351 --> 13:55.953
My mum's in London.

13:55.987 --> 13:57.387
Oh, mine's dead.

13:59.056 --> 14:01.324
Oh, what about your dad?

14:01.358 --> 14:02.893
He's in the war.

14:02.926 --> 14:04.461
So's mine.

14:05.929 --> 14:06.897
We might get invaded soon.

14:06.930 --> 14:07.864
Who says?

14:07.898 --> 14:08.932
My grandma.

14:08.966 --> 14:10.234
She said they might come here.

14:10.268 --> 14:10.901
Why?

14:10.934 --> 14:13.403
'Cause no one would suspect.

14:13.436 --> 14:15.305
Probably here already.

14:17.374 --> 14:18.375
Look, spies.

14:20.377 --> 14:22.113
They don't look like spies.

14:22.146 --> 14:24.182
That's the whole point, stupid.

14:27.118 --> 14:28.385
I'll show you for a peppermint.

14:28.418 --> 14:30.154
I've only got one.

14:31.088 --> 14:31.956
Half?

14:47.637 --> 14:48.973
Does anyone else live here?

14:49.006 --> 14:49.873
No.

14:57.948 --> 14:59.349
Do you have any pets?

14:59.382 --> 15:03.054
You think I should
have a cat, don't you?

15:09.026 --> 15:09.961
Read them if you like.

15:09.994 --> 15:10.962
No, thank you.

15:10.995 --> 15:11.862
Why not?

15:13.030 --> 15:14.464
They don't look
very interesting.

15:14.497 --> 15:15.899
I wrote them.

15:23.373 --> 15:24.208
Are they stories?

15:24.242 --> 15:25.109
No.

15:26.143 --> 15:28.246
Analysis of folklore,

15:28.279 --> 15:29.446
science behind the myths,

15:29.479 --> 15:31.948
visions, witches,
that sort of thing,

15:31.983 --> 15:34.318
women living alone with cats.

15:42.093 --> 15:43.227
That's Italy.

15:43.261 --> 15:46.197
What do you want, a prize?

15:46.230 --> 15:50.201
What do you call an
Italian with a cold?

15:50.234 --> 15:51.102
It's a joke.

15:51.135 --> 15:52.669
My mum taught me.

15:52.702 --> 15:53.536
A joke.

15:53.570 --> 15:55.273
You say, "I don't know.

15:55.306 --> 15:56.940
"What do you call an
Italian with a cold?"

15:56.974 --> 16:00.311
No, I say, speak when
you're spoken to.

16:01.379 --> 16:02.213
So...

16:02.246 --> 16:03.147
So what?

16:03.180 --> 16:04.948
What do you call an
Italian with a cold?

16:04.982 --> 16:06.716
I don't know.

16:06.750 --> 16:08.286
Julius Sneasar.

16:11.222 --> 16:12.356
That's ridiculous.

16:12.390 --> 16:13.224
It's funny.

16:13.257 --> 16:14.624
No, it's not.

16:14.658 --> 16:16.260
Actually, it's ignorant.

16:16.294 --> 16:18.963
Italy wasn't unified till 1861,

16:18.996 --> 16:20.331
so you should say,

16:20.364 --> 16:23.267
what do you call a
Roman with a cold?

16:23.301 --> 16:25.169
Tell your mother that.

16:53.097 --> 16:55.132
How are you getting on, son?

16:55.166 --> 16:59.270
Not missing the bright
lights, I hope?

16:59.303 --> 17:00.171
I know.

17:00.204 --> 17:02.739
You have rather
picked the bad apple,

17:02.772 --> 17:07.078
got the thin end of
the wedge, so to speak,

17:07.111 --> 17:09.046
the beast on the beach.

17:09.746 --> 17:10.780
No, forget I said that.

17:10.814 --> 17:11.647
I'm joking.

17:11.681 --> 17:13.217
You'll be fine.

17:13.250 --> 17:16.553
It's hard leaving people behind.

17:16.586 --> 17:19.256
You just have to
keep your pecker up.

17:19.290 --> 17:20.490
Could be worse.

17:21.523 --> 17:22.393
How?

17:32.269 --> 17:33.570
There's adders in the woods,

17:33.603 --> 17:34.771
poisonous ones.

17:34.804 --> 17:35.638
Want to come?

17:35.672 --> 17:37.208
No, thanks.

17:37.241 --> 17:38.508
You're scared.

17:38.541 --> 17:40.211
I'm not.

17:40.244 --> 17:42.046
I'm going to catch one,

17:42.079 --> 17:43.580
trap it, and make it into tea

17:43.613 --> 17:45.449
in case I'm abducted
by a German.

17:45.483 --> 17:47.351
What if he doesn't like tea?

17:47.385 --> 17:49.420
Everyone likes tea.

17:49.453 --> 17:50.787
Where are you going?

17:50.820 --> 17:52.323
Back to where I'm staying.

17:52.356 --> 17:53.556
No one lives up there

17:53.590 --> 17:55.126
except the witch.

17:56.193 --> 17:57.560
What witch?

17:57.594 --> 17:58.462
Race you.

18:04.135 --> 18:05.668
That's her.

18:09.806 --> 18:10.774
Do you live with her?

18:10.807 --> 18:12.343
Yes.

18:12.376 --> 18:13.377
She's mad.

18:13.411 --> 18:15.079
Says who?

18:15.112 --> 18:17.781
Says my grandma and everyone.

18:17.814 --> 18:19.783
She sends signals to the Nazis.

18:19.816 --> 18:21.085
No, she doesn't.

18:21.118 --> 18:22.453
She writes books.

18:22.486 --> 18:23.653
Spells.

18:23.686 --> 18:25.456
No, folklore and stuff.

18:25.489 --> 18:27.525
She'll make you her slave.

18:27.557 --> 18:29.393
They all have them.

18:29.427 --> 18:32.196
They make you work
till you're all bones.

18:32.229 --> 18:33.097
Then when you're worn out,

18:33.130 --> 18:36.233
they burn you or do
sex things to you.

18:37.501 --> 18:38.768
She won't.

18:42.506 --> 18:44.808
They'll never find your body.

18:59.290 --> 19:00.124
Is that King Arthur?

19:00.157 --> 19:01.591
No.

19:01.624 --> 19:03.360
It's Morgan le Fay.

19:03.394 --> 19:05.129
She was a sorceress.

19:08.232 --> 19:10.167
What's Fata Morgana?

19:10.201 --> 19:12.269
I thought you were
digging potatoes.

19:12.303 --> 19:14.438
They won't dig themselves.

19:18.375 --> 19:23.447
It's a myth about how she
lured sailors to their deaths.

19:23.481 --> 19:24.515
How?

19:24.548 --> 19:27.485
With visions of
floating islands.

19:28.552 --> 19:30.387
They say she'd conjure them up

19:30.421 --> 19:32.789
to make sailors
steer off course,

19:32.822 --> 19:34.724
crash their boats, and drown.

19:34.757 --> 19:36.393
Why?

19:36.427 --> 19:39.597
Because she's a
woman in folklore,

19:39.629 --> 19:41.165
ergo a temptress or a virgin.

19:41.198 --> 19:44.468
She's bound to get
blamed for something,

19:48.872 --> 19:51.542
but it isn't just Fata Morgana.

19:52.576 --> 19:53.877
There's all sorts of
myths about islands

19:53.910 --> 19:55.479
floating in the sky.

19:55.513 --> 19:56.679
Why?

19:56.713 --> 19:58.781
People like to have
something to believe in.

19:58.815 --> 20:03.420
It's what everyone wants,
magic, or God, or something.

20:05.322 --> 20:06.656
Hokum, all of it,

20:09.692 --> 20:12.695
but people must
have seen something.

20:19.702 --> 20:22.872
Stories have to
come from somewhere.

20:56.806 --> 20:57.641
nasty witch.

20:58.841 --> 20:59.709
Hey.

21:03.514 --> 21:04.847
Hey, I told you.

21:04.881 --> 21:05.915
Clear off.

21:05.949 --> 21:06.783
Get out.

21:08.519 --> 21:09.919
Frank.

21:09.954 --> 21:11.322
You're a Nazi.

21:11.355 --> 21:13.424
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

21:20.297 --> 21:20.930
Hold still.

21:20.965 --> 21:23.434
I've got things to do.

21:23.467 --> 21:24.702
Frank.

21:24.734 --> 21:26.270
Are you a Nazi?

21:27.504 --> 21:28.339
Yes, I'm a Nazi.

21:28.372 --> 21:31.709
I'm going to murder
you in your bed.

21:31.741 --> 21:32.775
'Course I'm not a Nazi.

21:32.809 --> 21:33.943
Now come here.

21:36.313 --> 21:37.047
Will it sting?

21:37.081 --> 21:39.350
Hey, you'll have to toughen up.

21:39.383 --> 21:42.586
You want them to
think you're a coward?

21:59.069 --> 22:01.372
Why did they do it?

22:01.405 --> 22:03.873
They've nothing better to do.

22:03.906 --> 22:06.343
Probably think it's funny,

22:06.377 --> 22:08.845
a woman living here on her own.

22:11.448 --> 22:12.516
Why do you?

22:16.786 --> 22:20.524
I suppose it's just
the way it worked out.

22:21.625 --> 22:24.295
Empty that before you spill it.

22:36.006 --> 22:37.474
Vera Wellbond.

22:38.875 --> 22:41.745
How do you do?

22:48.052 --> 22:50.387
Alice, as in Wonderland?

22:50.421 --> 22:53.691
No, after Alice
Evans, microbiologist,

22:54.992 --> 22:56.694
my father's idea.

22:56.727 --> 22:59.630
Oh, is he a scientist?

22:59.663 --> 23:00.531
He was.

23:02.533 --> 23:03.534
I'm sorry.

23:04.802 --> 23:06.337
It's all right.

23:08.472 --> 23:11.542
It's not though,
is it, presumably?

23:15.112 --> 23:15.979
No,

23:18.115 --> 23:19.049
not really.

23:20.784 --> 23:22.386
Not really at all.

23:26.957 --> 23:28.692
Well, here we are,

23:30.994 --> 23:33.597
so I say, make the most of it.

23:34.897 --> 23:35.999
What do you do?

23:36.033 --> 23:37.768
I'm a history student.

23:37.801 --> 23:39.069
You?

23:39.103 --> 23:41.605
Modern languages officially,

23:41.638 --> 23:43.873
but truth is, I'm
writing a novel.

23:43.906 --> 23:44.842
Don't tell.

23:45.976 --> 23:47.111
I love this.

23:49.012 --> 23:50.681
Let's talk afterwards.

23:50.714 --> 23:53.050
I know just the place we can go.

25:16.767 --> 25:18.135
You'll fall over.

25:28.946 --> 25:29.613
Oi.

25:31.014 --> 25:32.916
I can't make the wings stay on.

25:32.951 --> 25:33.784
You think it's fun

25:33.817 --> 25:35.252
to play games about war.

25:35.285 --> 25:36.153
I'm not.

25:46.997 --> 25:49.199
They're too heavy.

25:49.233 --> 25:50.033
If you insist on doing it,

25:50.067 --> 25:52.836
you might at least
do it properly.

25:52.870 --> 25:55.005
You need balsa wood or cedar.

25:55.038 --> 25:57.107
Go and look in the drift.

26:26.770 --> 26:28.205
Is this for your book?

26:28.238 --> 26:29.106
Mhm.

26:34.144 --> 26:35.345
You, yao...

26:35.379 --> 26:36.246
Yao Bay.

26:40.617 --> 26:41.618
What are they?

26:41.652 --> 26:42.653
Sightings.

26:43.554 --> 26:46.924
1916, a painter says
he sees an island

26:46.958 --> 26:48.225
rise out of the sea.

26:48.258 --> 26:50.360
The papers say it's a submarine.

26:50.394 --> 26:51.628
It's got trees on it.

26:51.662 --> 26:54.097
Yes, look at the coastlines.

26:57.200 --> 26:58.602
Yao Bay.

26:58.635 --> 27:00.137
Yao.

27:00.170 --> 27:02.105
They're the same shape.

27:03.140 --> 27:05.342
Now look at this.

27:07.678 --> 27:09.746
We're here near Ramsgate.

27:13.183 --> 27:14.651
Notice anything?

27:16.086 --> 27:17.821
It's the same too.

27:19.289 --> 27:20.891
Look, read this.

27:23.962 --> 27:27.164
"The cliffs between Dover
and Ramsgate inca"...

27:27.197 --> 27:28.066
Intercept.

27:28.098 --> 27:31.069
"Intercept the view
of Dover Castle"...

27:31.101 --> 27:32.336
"Yet the people of Ramsgate

27:32.369 --> 27:35.974
"saw Dover Castle
floating above the sea."

27:37.341 --> 27:38.208
Proof.

27:39.209 --> 27:41.079
Floating Islands here.

27:43.280 --> 27:44.181
Where are you going?

27:44.214 --> 27:45.682
To see it for myself.

27:45.716 --> 27:46.383
Where?

27:47.952 --> 27:48.885
Ramsgate.

27:50.387 --> 27:51.655
Can I come?

27:51.688 --> 27:52.322
No.

27:52.356 --> 27:53.657
Please.

27:59.896 --> 28:00.764
Hey.

28:09.773 --> 28:12.409
That's where they saw it.
There.

28:22.987 --> 28:24.989
What happens now?

28:25.023 --> 28:26.090
We wait.

28:26.124 --> 28:27.691
For what?

28:27.724 --> 28:29.060
Magic?

28:29.093 --> 28:30.427
Science, proof.

28:39.137 --> 28:40.904
Have you ever been in a plane?

28:40.937 --> 28:42.073
No chance.

28:42.106 --> 28:43.206
Are you scared?

28:43.240 --> 28:46.443
Do you always ask
mindless questions?

28:49.147 --> 28:50.180
Have you?

28:50.213 --> 28:52.349
Yup, with my pa.

28:52.382 --> 28:53.884
What's it like?

28:58.321 --> 29:01.358
Really loud, and sometimes
I couldn't breathe.

29:01.391 --> 29:03.027
Weren't you scared?

29:03.061 --> 29:05.328
Only when they shot at us.

29:07.497 --> 29:09.332
Why are you lying?

29:09.366 --> 29:10.233
I'm not.

29:12.469 --> 29:13.470
Look there.

29:13.503 --> 29:14.871
Where, what...

29:14.905 --> 29:15.739
There, right there,

29:15.772 --> 29:16.606
below the big cloud.

29:16.640 --> 29:17.874
You're not looking
where I'm looking.

29:17.908 --> 29:18.742
Where?

29:18.775 --> 29:19.409
It's there.

29:19.443 --> 29:20.243
Look, it's a tower.

29:20.277 --> 29:21.112
Where?

29:21.145 --> 29:21.979
It's there.

29:22.013 --> 29:22.846
It's a tower.

29:22.879 --> 29:23.513
I can't see...

29:23.547 --> 29:24.381
Our floating island

29:24.414 --> 29:25.116
with a green flag
on it on a turret.

29:25.149 --> 29:27.517
Look, a green flag on a turret.

29:27.551 --> 29:29.153
Look, right there.

29:31.855 --> 29:34.257
Do you think this is a game?

29:35.325 --> 29:37.394
This is my work.

29:37.427 --> 29:39.830
Dover Castle doesn't fly flags.

29:39.863 --> 29:42.066
I saw it, a green flag on
a turret. I'm not flying...

29:42.100 --> 29:43.201
You're not taking
this seriously.

29:43.233 --> 29:44.102
Where are you going...

29:44.135 --> 29:44.969
We're going home.

29:45.002 --> 29:45.836
It's not my home.

29:45.869 --> 29:46.503
Well, stay here then.

29:46.536 --> 29:48.338
See if I care.

30:57.374 --> 30:58.242
Frank.

31:11.388 --> 31:12.256
Frank.

31:13.991 --> 31:15.392
You really saw it.

31:20.231 --> 31:21.565
I'm sorry, Frank.

31:57.367 --> 31:58.902
What are you doing?

31:58.935 --> 32:00.037
It's broken.

32:00.071 --> 32:02.505
Well, what do you think
we should do about that then?

32:36.974 --> 32:38.508
What if it breaks?

32:39.643 --> 32:42.612
All right, listen to me.

32:42.646 --> 32:44.181
Life is not kind.

32:45.249 --> 32:47.118
Anguish is inevitable.

32:48.286 --> 32:50.254
Your heart will break.

32:50.288 --> 32:52.156
Your friends will die.

32:53.257 --> 32:57.061
You may even think
about killing yourself.

32:57.094 --> 32:59.397
Planes crash, Frank.

32:59.429 --> 33:02.499
What matters is how
you deal with it.

33:04.402 --> 33:06.070
What if it crashes?

33:07.104 --> 33:08.571
What if it crashes?

33:10.774 --> 33:13.044
I'll build another one.

33:14.011 --> 33:15.079
Well, then.

33:16.347 --> 33:18.416
What are you waiting for?

33:24.155 --> 33:25.022
Frank.

33:41.705 --> 33:43.341
Worth it?

33:43.374 --> 33:44.241
Yeah.

33:47.477 --> 33:49.380
Why don't you have a husband?

33:49.413 --> 33:51.681
Why don't you have a wife?

33:52.716 --> 33:54.784
You think I need a husband?

33:54.818 --> 33:57.021
Did you ever have one?

33:57.054 --> 33:59.123
There was someone once.

34:00.191 --> 34:01.325
Who?

34:01.359 --> 34:03.294
It's in the past now.

34:05.829 --> 34:06.663
Did you get married?

34:06.696 --> 34:07.664
No.

34:07.697 --> 34:08.331
Why not?

34:08.366 --> 34:11.101
What is this, 20 Questions?

34:12.835 --> 34:14.304
Can we have chips for dinner?

34:14.338 --> 34:16.773
You always want chips.

34:16.806 --> 34:18.442
Thank God I've only got
you for a few more days,

34:18.476 --> 34:21.212
or I'd probably starve to death.

34:33.857 --> 34:34.690
You're missing the view.

34:34.724 --> 34:35.558
You'll miss the turning.

34:35.592 --> 34:36.427
Who cares?

34:36.460 --> 34:37.293
I like this road.

34:37.328 --> 34:39.063
I care, V.

34:39.096 --> 34:40.498
I'd quite like to get
there in one piece

34:40.530 --> 34:41.498
if you'd only concentrate on...

34:41.531 --> 34:42.433
♪ Where's that blue
room they sing about ♪

34:42.466 --> 34:45.335
♪ Where's that sunshine
they sing about ♪

34:45.369 --> 34:50.174

34:55.678 --> 34:57.415
you left the turning.

35:02.685 --> 35:05.456
Look at the lake! Where
are you taking me?

35:07.657 --> 35:09.226
It's an older tree.

35:12.163 --> 35:14.631
I always thought it was sacred.

35:44.261 --> 35:45.762
I like your feet.

35:45.795 --> 35:48.499
My feet? Why are you
looking at my feet?

35:48.532 --> 35:51.302
They are a very nice shape.

35:51.335 --> 35:53.237
Why don't you paint your toes?

35:53.270 --> 35:54.338
Why would I?

35:54.371 --> 35:56.806
'Cause, they're old and crusty

35:56.840 --> 36:01.845
and you might want to look
nice. Like a normal person.

36:02.213 --> 36:03.314
That's it.

36:03.347 --> 36:04.881
Don't go in, stay.

36:19.929 --> 36:21.398
Do you miss him?

36:24.535 --> 36:26.203
You are allowed to.

36:28.405 --> 36:30.407
Do you miss your father?

36:45.422 --> 36:47.491
I think you're remarkable

36:50.760 --> 36:51.595
to get by

36:53.597 --> 36:54.598
with no one.

36:57.734 --> 36:59.270
Not no one now.

37:23.260 --> 37:24.261
I saw a fish.

37:25.695 --> 37:29.732
It was right here, and
then it moved really fast.

37:29.766 --> 37:32.769
Hello, are you a
friend from school?

37:34.004 --> 37:34.972
This is Edie.

37:35.005 --> 37:35.872
Hello Edie.

37:38.741 --> 37:40.477
There's a letter for you.

37:40.511 --> 37:42.812
Is there? Do you
want to come in?

37:42.845 --> 37:43.981
You're joking.

37:46.350 --> 37:47.218
See ya.

37:48.686 --> 37:49.653
Where is it?

37:49.687 --> 37:50.820
On the table

37:56.026 --> 37:57.528
Any news?

37:57.561 --> 38:00.531
Dad's got a new plane. It's
called A Lucky Ventura.

38:00.564 --> 38:03.400
It's got twin engines
and it's blue.

38:03.434 --> 38:07.004
And your mother? She's got
a job talking to ministers

38:07.037 --> 38:08.539
Ministers? Doing what?

38:08.572 --> 38:09.640
Doesn't say

38:11.308 --> 38:13.377
it's because of the war.

38:13.410 --> 38:14.944
You should write back.

38:38.702 --> 38:39.869
Put this in too.

38:39.902 --> 38:41.005
What is it?

38:41.038 --> 38:45.709
It says as I'm sending you
back your pain in my side.

38:46.876 --> 38:48.712
It's all right.

38:48.746 --> 38:52.416
A couple more days
you'll be gone anyway.

38:52.449 --> 38:53.517
Where will I go?

38:53.550 --> 38:58.389
With a family from school
I expect, much more fun.

38:58.422 --> 38:59.822
Could I stay here?

39:03.761 --> 39:05.996
I told you I have to work.

39:06.030 --> 39:08.966
Less chance of that
with you around

39:12.935 --> 39:15.773
Come on. We'll
post it on the way.

39:16.974 --> 39:18.609
Where are we going?

39:18.642 --> 39:19.777
Tart hunting.

39:36.893 --> 39:38.062
The floating islands
in the clouds...

39:38.095 --> 39:39.730
Is that like heaven.

39:39.763 --> 39:43.767
No, it's physics.
Some sort of mirage.

39:43.801 --> 39:45.102
Do you believe in heaven?

39:45.135 --> 39:46.170
Yes.

39:46.203 --> 39:48.938
Well you shouldn't just
made up by the Christians

39:48.972 --> 39:50.974
to make themselves feel better.

39:51.008 --> 39:52.142
How do you know?

39:52.176 --> 39:54.911
Because if it was true,

39:54.944 --> 39:55.979
what happened to all
the people who died

39:56.013 --> 40:01.051
before the Christians?
Where did their souls go?

40:01.085 --> 40:02.686
Summerland.

40:02.720 --> 40:03.587
Where?

40:03.620 --> 40:06.957
Summerland. Come on.
I know a shortcut.

40:11.028 --> 40:13.397
Where's Summerland?

40:13.430 --> 40:14.765
Here.

40:14.798 --> 40:16.133
In Kent?

40:16.166 --> 40:20.637
No. all around us, like a
layer that we can't see,

40:22.706 --> 40:26.009
until it gets disturbed
by a restless soul.

40:26.043 --> 40:27.745
So it's trying to
tell us something.

40:27.778 --> 40:28.712
How?

40:28.746 --> 40:32.616
How do you think by
disturbing the patterns?

40:34.952 --> 40:37.488
Look, patterns in the clouds.

40:40.591 --> 40:44.995
Pagans thought they were
signs, from Summerland. Magic

40:47.930 --> 40:49.566
I thought you didn't
believe in magic.

40:49.600 --> 40:50.467
I don't.

40:51.901 --> 40:54.772
Stories have come from
somewhere.

40:59.042 --> 41:01.612
In the myth about Morgan Murphy,

41:01.645 --> 41:03.714
do you know what some
of the sailors song?

41:03.747 --> 41:04.782
What?

41:04.815 --> 41:08.786
Summerland. If it's
invisible except sometimes,

41:09.653 --> 41:11.155
like the island.

41:11.188 --> 41:13.490
They're completely
different ideas.

41:13.524 --> 41:16.093
Summerland's pagan,
but Morgan is a myth.

41:16.126 --> 41:20.864
It could be the same. If its
dead people make you sign,

41:21.965 --> 41:24.635
maybe Summerland is the island.

41:25.569 --> 41:26.970
And if it's real.

41:28.505 --> 41:30.607
The islands a mirages,

41:30.641 --> 41:32.976
and Summeland's
just a pagan heaven.

41:33.010 --> 41:37.481
How do you know? Just
because you haven't seen it.

41:46.824 --> 41:48.625
Can I have her
now? It's my turn.

41:48.659 --> 41:50.027
I haven't had long enough.

41:50.060 --> 41:50.928
Please?

41:53.864 --> 41:54.731
What is that?

41:54.765 --> 41:57.501
This is Molly. She's our rat.

41:57.534 --> 41:59.636
We're taking turns
to look after her.

41:59.670 --> 42:00.871
She's not coming inside.

42:00.904 --> 42:02.940
She'll stay in my pockets.

42:03.006 --> 42:04.141
What happened to your shoe?

42:04.174 --> 42:05.209
Edie slipped on the rocks.

42:05.242 --> 42:06.109
No, I didn't.

42:06.143 --> 42:07.110
We'd better clean it up.

42:07.144 --> 42:07.778
No,

42:07.811 --> 42:10.214
You don't want an infection.

42:10.247 --> 42:11.114
Ow, ow.

42:14.885 --> 42:16.955
This might sting a bit.

42:21.058 --> 42:22.693
Ow

42:22.726 --> 42:24.127
All done. Better?

42:27.064 --> 42:28.632
Yes.

42:28.665 --> 42:30.667
Do you want to stay for dinner?

42:30.701 --> 42:34.171
It's Frank's last night
so I'm celebrating.

42:36.173 --> 42:38.008
I'm not allowed.

42:38.041 --> 42:38.909
Oh?

42:43.280 --> 42:45.782
Well then. Another the time.

43:14.611 --> 43:15.245
Excuse me.

43:15.279 --> 43:16.680
Sorry, sorry.

43:56.753 --> 43:59.890
Can we put some music on?

44:02.392 --> 44:03.794
Put it back.

44:03.827 --> 44:04.661
What is it?

44:04.695 --> 44:05.829
Put it back.

44:13.704 --> 44:15.172
Hand me your plate.

44:22.312 --> 44:23.180
Sorry,

44:25.016 --> 44:25.882
it's just

44:27.718 --> 44:30.287
it was a gift that's all.

44:30.320 --> 44:31.254
From who?

44:34.424 --> 44:36.094
A lady, a friend.

44:38.362 --> 44:39.830
It's a good tune.

44:41.198 --> 44:43.667
Was she the one you loved?

44:45.469 --> 44:47.404
Why did you say that?

44:55.079 --> 44:57.681
Would you think it was strange

44:59.783 --> 45:02.219
if a woman loved another woman?

45:06.189 --> 45:07.058
No.

45:15.932 --> 45:17.701
Sorry, its not you.

45:19.137 --> 45:20.937
You didn't, its just.

45:24.042 --> 45:26.443
Most people think it's wicked.

45:28.079 --> 45:28.912
Why?

45:33.483 --> 45:34.885
I don't know.

45:38.288 --> 45:40.091
They think it's a sin

45:42.060 --> 45:43.260
to love someone

45:46.229 --> 45:48.099
we should burn in hell.

45:51.535 --> 45:56.074
It's not as bad as marrying
somebody you don't like.

46:00.310 --> 46:02.746
Do they hug you? At home?

46:04.982 --> 46:05.983
Sometimes.

46:07.018 --> 46:09.352
Sometimes they just get quiet.

46:12.990 --> 46:14.458
Did you kiss her?

46:18.029 --> 46:20.897
How would you feel
if I said yes?

46:20.931 --> 46:22.265
Don't know

46:22.299 --> 46:25.235
Then yes. How is that?

46:25.268 --> 46:26.903
Alright.

46:26.937 --> 46:28.206
Was on the lips?

46:29.173 --> 46:32.776
Mostly. Eat up. The
stew is getting cold.

46:40.517 --> 46:43.054
Tell me how to make your bed.

46:43.087 --> 46:44.254
Top two corners,

46:44.287 --> 46:45.822
Then?

46:45.856 --> 46:48.458
the bottom and then the other.

46:48.492 --> 46:52.395
And make sure you
put the pots away

46:52.429 --> 46:54.865
and write to your mother.

46:54.898 --> 46:56.333
Always help with the washing up.

46:56.366 --> 46:57.969
And?

46:58.002 --> 47:00.337
Don't always ask for chips.

47:06.043 --> 47:09.880
Ready for the big day.
Good news, my boy.

47:09.913 --> 47:14.918
We found you a family. Decent
enough people that retired.

47:15.153 --> 47:18.055
They live just up the coast
and there's a place for you

47:18.089 --> 47:22.026
at St. Joseph's. It's
not a bad school at all.

47:22.059 --> 47:23.127
Don't want a new school?

47:23.161 --> 47:24.594
Surely you can keep him here.

47:24.628 --> 47:27.965
Well he can't go to school
here if he doesn't live here.

47:27.999 --> 47:30.300
This isn't what you
said. Why did you lie?

47:30.333 --> 47:32.869
I didn't know. Frank.

47:32.903 --> 47:33.570
Frank.

47:40.278 --> 47:41.145
Be good.

48:17.914 --> 48:21.918
Come on. What do the stars
have in store a down?

48:23.955 --> 48:26.023
Long life, good health,

48:27.959 --> 48:30.894
you meet a delectable
woman at 22

48:30.927 --> 48:33.630
and never look back again.

48:33.663 --> 48:35.365
And this line?

48:35.398 --> 48:38.535
That line says you
ought to use cold cream.

48:41.138 --> 48:42.273
And this one?

48:43.241 --> 48:46.077
You are destined to
be a fine novelist.

48:46.110 --> 48:49.313
But first you have
to finish your book.

48:52.216 --> 48:53.917
What else does my palm say?

48:53.951 --> 48:54.952
That's it.

49:03.693 --> 49:05.428
What about family?

49:06.964 --> 49:08.032
Can't tell.

49:14.404 --> 49:15.273
Al,

49:16.240 --> 49:18.376
why won't we talk about this?

49:18.408 --> 49:19.043
V -

49:19.076 --> 49:21.611
We need to talk about this.

49:25.249 --> 49:26.516
I want a family.

49:29.153 --> 49:32.356
What if I want to be a mother?

50:12.796 --> 50:15.399
When will you come and play?

50:22.739 --> 50:25.475
Ready to meet your new family?

50:36.387 --> 50:38.655
You'd have to be on your
very best behavior.

50:38.688 --> 50:40.157
We can't be finding your new set

50:40.191 --> 50:42.492
when this lot give
you the heave ho.

50:42.525 --> 50:44.261
I'm joking. Come on.

50:50.067 --> 50:54.604
You know I'll give you
straight back if you misbehave.

50:56.573 --> 50:58.508
Go and then it's yours.

51:03.481 --> 51:04.415
What is it?

51:09.153 --> 51:12.555
Why did you say I couldn't stay?

51:12.589 --> 51:14.624
Thought you didn't want me.

51:14.657 --> 51:16.260
Changed my mind.

51:18.396 --> 51:19.729
I'm sorry, Frank.

51:22.199 --> 51:23.401
It's the truth.

51:24.634 --> 51:26.504
I wouldn't lie to you.

51:28.472 --> 51:29.340
Promise?

51:30.508 --> 51:31.509
I promise.

51:34.544 --> 51:37.248
Mr. Sullivan said it's
your birthday tomorrow.

51:37.281 --> 51:38.115
Can we have cake?

51:38.149 --> 51:39.150
We'll see.

51:41.152 --> 51:42.319
I'm hunting scrap iron.

51:42.353 --> 51:45.089
Mr Sullivan said that they
give us a penny for every box.

51:45.122 --> 51:46.223
Wanna come?

51:46.257 --> 51:47.158
Can I?

51:47.191 --> 51:48.059
Go on.

51:49.793 --> 51:52.063
Be back before it's dark.

52:06.643 --> 52:08.546
Look, what I found.

52:08.578 --> 52:11.115
We'll get a penny for that.

52:15.685 --> 52:17.488
I might run away soon.

52:17.521 --> 52:19.123
My grandma's getting an evacuee.

52:19.156 --> 52:20.224
Might be good

52:20.257 --> 52:21.624
No, they're only getting her

52:21.658 --> 52:23.693
because I'm an
inadequate offspring.

52:23.726 --> 52:24.661
Says who?

52:25.929 --> 52:27.531
I've read about it.

52:27.565 --> 52:28.598
They're compensating because

52:28.631 --> 52:31.734
I don't fulfill the feminine
ideal, like mom did.

52:31.768 --> 52:33.837
I know because they
ordered a girl,

52:33.870 --> 52:36.373
who would like ballet
and everything.

52:36.407 --> 52:38.409
I'm glad you don't like ballet.

52:38.442 --> 52:39.876
You don't fancy me do you?

52:39.909 --> 52:41.378
No, bomers up?

52:53.224 --> 52:55.226
No, I don't want another one.

52:55.259 --> 52:56.160
Is Frank here?

52:56.193 --> 52:58.628
He's out with Edie
I need to speak to him.

52:58.661 --> 53:02.466
What is it? I can tell
him when he gets back.

53:02.500 --> 53:03.367
What is it?

53:06.203 --> 53:07.271
His father..

53:09.839 --> 53:10.907
His father?

53:16.480 --> 53:19.383
We just had the telegram.

53:39.270 --> 53:40.870
He's not on his own.

53:40.904 --> 53:43.641
You'll have to tell him.

53:43.706 --> 53:44.774
Me?

53:44.807 --> 53:47.244
I can't stay here all night.

53:47.278 --> 53:50.247
I, uh-uh, his mother,
she should tell him.

53:50.281 --> 53:51.482
We've been trying to contact her

53:51.515 --> 53:52.616
but she is working
for the ministry.

53:52.650 --> 53:54.218
They're not likely
to release her.

53:54.251 --> 53:55.286
What if she telephones?

53:55.319 --> 53:58.289
Telephoned? He's
a child Miss Lam.

53:58.322 --> 54:03.327
He has to be told probably
face to face and looked after.

54:03.360 --> 54:04.361
You tell him.

54:04.395 --> 54:06.630
It's his birthday
tomorrow. I can't tell him.

54:06.664 --> 54:07.797
Do it tonight.

54:44.901 --> 54:47.837
Guess what I got.
Come on, guess.

54:50.007 --> 54:51.508
What?

54:51.542 --> 54:54.712
It's bacon, from Mrs. Bassett.

54:54.744 --> 54:56.981
I think it's because
she felt sorry for me

54:57.014 --> 54:59.483
because I'm staying with you.

54:59.516 --> 55:01.986
She does know I want to though.

55:03.721 --> 55:06.390
Can we have bacon sandwiches

55:08.825 --> 55:09.693
and chips?

55:10.893 --> 55:11.761
Yes.

55:23.574 --> 55:27.910
Please may I have a birthday
party. Edie could come.

55:29.446 --> 55:30.648
And you and me.

55:32.082 --> 55:32.949
Frank-

55:40.391 --> 55:44.061
Do you think I
could get a bicycle?

55:44.094 --> 55:45.029
Edie has one.

56:33.444 --> 56:37.715
Look what I've got, all
the way from south today.

56:48.425 --> 56:49.892
What are you doing?

56:49.926 --> 56:51.762
You said you'd give me time.

56:51.795 --> 56:53.030
I tried to say but
you wouldn't listen.

56:53.063 --> 56:54.598
But I love you.

56:57.101 --> 56:58.969
What can we ever be?

57:01.572 --> 57:04.941
Two spinsters who can
barely walk out together?

57:04.975 --> 57:06.176
Don't you dare be a coward?

57:06.210 --> 57:07.411
Childless?

57:11.582 --> 57:13.117
The rest I can take.

57:14.651 --> 57:16.987
What people say, all of that,

57:20.923 --> 57:21.792
for you.

57:26.196 --> 57:28.532
But I want to be a mother.

57:31.068 --> 57:32.736
More than anything.

57:36.573 --> 57:37.775
More than us?

57:40.611 --> 57:41.745
Please don't.

57:42.846 --> 57:43.847
I'm sorry.

57:45.582 --> 57:47.217
Please don't do this.

57:47.251 --> 57:48.085
I'm sorry.

58:33.730 --> 58:34.865
What is that?

58:34.898 --> 58:36.834
My birthday hat.

58:36.867 --> 58:39.536
That nowhere in the blackout.

58:41.238 --> 58:43.974
See you later. Happy birthday.

58:45.976 --> 58:49.880
Good morning class two. We
have a new evacuee joining us.

58:49.913 --> 58:54.117
Cassie is staying with
Edie Cory isn't that right?

58:54.151 --> 58:56.620
And she's come all
the way from Belfast.

58:57.688 --> 59:00.624
Mr. Sullivan. Do
you have a moment?

59:04.728 --> 59:06.063
I leave you to it.

59:06.096 --> 59:06.965
Right.

59:07.865 --> 59:10.133
Where would you like to sit?

59:11.768 --> 59:12.669
That's my seat.

59:12.703 --> 59:16.073
Let's be kind to our
new friend. Please.

59:16.106 --> 59:19.978
There, Frank will look after
you. You can be partners.

59:20.010 --> 59:21.945
Frank would like that.

59:25.949 --> 59:26.850
Race me.

59:26.884 --> 59:30.254
What about Cassie
shouldn't we ask her?

59:30.287 --> 59:32.856
Last one past the
goal is a German.

59:32.890 --> 59:33.757
Edie. wait!

59:37.127 --> 59:38.695
What in heavens name?

59:38.729 --> 59:39.763
Escaping the Germans.

59:39.796 --> 59:42.232
That is not funny. Who's this?

59:42.266 --> 59:44.935
Frank. It's his birthday?

59:44.969 --> 59:48.238
Oh, happy birthday. Frank.
Are you having a party?

59:48.272 --> 59:51.675
Yes. I'm gonna go on a trip.
Trying to find Summerland.

59:51.708 --> 59:52.643
Where?

59:52.676 --> 59:56.113
It's a ghost island
for Mrs. Landsberg. Ah,

59:56.146 --> 59:57.881
Right. Frank, off you go.

59:57.915 --> 01:00:00.851
Edie, You're coming
with me. Come on.

01:00:00.884 --> 01:00:02.987
In here. I need mushrooms.

01:00:03.021 --> 01:00:04.688
Whatever was that all about?

01:00:04.721 --> 01:00:06.189
Edie is not coming.

01:00:08.225 --> 01:00:12.229
Come on. Lets get going
while the lights good.

01:00:14.999 --> 01:00:15.866
Come on!

01:00:18.235 --> 01:00:19.102
Come on!

01:00:20.804 --> 01:00:21.738
Mrs. Corey-

01:00:21.772 --> 01:00:24.374
She's up to no good,
and that's not right.

01:00:24.408 --> 01:00:27.177
Not when there's a child,
you need to do something.

01:00:27.210 --> 01:00:29.079
And until then I don't
want Edie mixing with him.

01:00:29.112 --> 01:00:30.380
I can't not go to school.

01:00:30.414 --> 01:00:32.649
Or Cassey, put him
in another class.

01:00:32.683 --> 01:00:36.887
For God's sake. He's
just lost his father,

01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:39.923
he needs all the
friends he can get.

01:00:41.358 --> 01:00:42.961
You didn't know.

01:00:44.361 --> 01:00:47.966
Aircraft Carrier
sank at the weekend.

01:00:47.999 --> 01:00:50.133
Terrible business.

01:00:50.167 --> 01:00:51.768
Did you have to tell him?

01:00:51.802 --> 01:00:53.203
No Miss Lam did.

01:00:54.771 --> 01:00:57.008
I hope she did it gently.

01:00:57.041 --> 01:01:01.045
Bad news is bad news.
However you tell it.

01:01:01.079 --> 01:01:03.814
There's nothing makes it easier.

01:01:06.416 --> 01:01:07.918
I've got a surprise for you.

01:01:07.952 --> 01:01:08.585
What is it?

01:01:08.619 --> 01:01:11.188
You'll have to wait and see.

01:01:11.221 --> 01:01:16.193
Edie, we thought you weren't
coming. We've got cake.

01:01:16.226 --> 01:01:18.362
I'm Jenny rabbit. Come on.

01:01:31.408 --> 01:01:33.310
Surprise! Who goes first.

01:01:33.343 --> 01:01:35.013
Lets shake for it.

01:01:40.051 --> 01:01:41.119
Come on Edie!

01:01:41.151 --> 01:01:42.152
What's wrong? Come on.

01:01:42.185 --> 01:01:43.087
I don't want to.

01:01:43.121 --> 01:01:44.855
Come on. Ready go.

01:01:46.289 --> 01:01:47.157
My turn.

01:01:49.127 --> 01:01:50.761
What did you get for
your birthday Frank?

01:01:50.794 --> 01:01:52.863
My hat, I showed you.

01:01:52.896 --> 01:01:56.867
I meant from your mom
and dad.

01:01:56.900 --> 01:01:59.269
- Where did you say they are?
- Spin me, spin me, spin me.

01:01:59.302 --> 01:02:00.337
Edie.

01:02:00.370 --> 01:02:01.338
I told you, my mom is
working with the ministers

01:02:01.371 --> 01:02:05.342
and my dad's got a new
plane. Spin me faster.

01:02:08.945 --> 01:02:09.813
Edie!

01:02:18.755 --> 01:02:20.390
You haven't told him!

01:02:20.424 --> 01:02:22.893
I was trying to protect him.

01:02:22.926 --> 01:02:23.827
You're not his mom.

01:02:23.860 --> 01:02:24.494
Edie please,

01:02:24.528 --> 01:02:25.362
You're not.

01:02:25.395 --> 01:02:26.229
Listen to me.

01:02:26.263 --> 01:02:27.165
You're a liar, a liar!

01:02:27.197 --> 01:02:29.067
Edie please, please.

01:02:31.035 --> 01:02:32.369
You're not right.

01:02:32.402 --> 01:02:34.304
I promise it's his
birthday. Please

01:02:34.337 --> 01:02:36.074
But you're lying to him
when will you tell him?

01:02:36.107 --> 01:02:38.142
I'll tell him
tomorrow, I promise.

01:02:38.176 --> 01:02:39.376
Promise what?

01:02:42.279 --> 01:02:46.283
It's a surprise
for your birthday.

01:02:46.316 --> 01:02:48.986
Well, we should get going.
We haven't even had cake yet.

01:02:49.020 --> 01:02:53.790
We are, we are having cake.
Go in, we'll follow you up.

01:02:56.460 --> 01:02:57.461
Get off me.

01:02:57.494 --> 01:02:59.296
Edie, listen to me.

01:03:00.263 --> 01:03:03.333
I promise you. I will
tell him tomorrow.

01:03:03.366 --> 01:03:04.868
But just let me do it my way.

01:03:04.901 --> 01:03:07.437
You mustn't say anything to him

01:03:07.471 --> 01:03:12.476
Do you understand? Edie? Edie,
listen to me. Do you understand?

01:03:13.177 --> 01:03:14.045
Edie? Edie?

01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:31.428
Why did Edie go home?

01:03:31.461 --> 01:03:33.263
She was just dizzy.

01:03:36.833 --> 01:03:38.970
Can I ask you something?

01:03:40.071 --> 01:03:42.073
How come only I could see it.

01:03:42.106 --> 01:03:43.040
See what?

01:03:44.208 --> 01:03:47.211
Summerland. How
come you couldn't?

01:03:48.545 --> 01:03:50.480
Maybe I need glasses.

01:03:53.316 --> 01:03:56.920
I think someone's
trying to speak to me.

01:04:01.458 --> 01:04:05.862
It's just a story. It's
just a trick of the light

01:04:08.166 --> 01:04:11.368
Like a mirage in the
desert refraction.

01:04:17.141 --> 01:04:18.276
It isn't real.

01:04:21.611 --> 01:04:22.946
But if it was,

01:04:24.347 --> 01:04:26.017
if it was someone,

01:04:26.984 --> 01:04:28.919
trying to speak to you,

01:04:30.054 --> 01:04:31.454
someone who passed

01:04:33.490 --> 01:04:35.159
it would but mean,

01:04:37.261 --> 01:04:38.996
that they loved you,

01:04:39.663 --> 01:04:40.530
very much

01:04:43.201 --> 01:04:45.435
and they wanted you to know.

01:05:06.190 --> 01:05:08.159
N is for not.

01:06:00.111 --> 01:06:02.146
Don't run, don't run.

01:06:02.179 --> 01:06:04.181
Go on, do what you like.

01:06:05.515 --> 01:06:08.986
Frank, Frank. I'm
deeply sorry, Frank.

01:06:11.055 --> 01:06:12.290
If you need someone to talk to,

01:06:12.323 --> 01:06:14.125
I'm fine thanks.

01:06:14.158 --> 01:06:15.026
Sorry?

01:06:15.859 --> 01:06:17.460
I'm used to it now
its all right.

01:06:17.494 --> 01:06:20.430
You don't have to
put on a brave face

01:06:20.463 --> 01:06:23.667
with me now chap. It's
a terrible shock.

01:06:25.502 --> 01:06:27.271
Can I go now?

01:06:27.305 --> 01:06:28.306
Of course.

01:08:50.214 --> 01:08:51.448
Do you want to go?

01:08:51.482 --> 01:08:52.749
It's for two people.

01:08:52.782 --> 01:08:54.118
It's alright.

01:08:55.453 --> 01:08:56.618
You could have my
turn if you like.

01:08:56.653 --> 01:08:58.154
Frank.

01:08:58.189 --> 01:09:00.457
I was only looking.

01:09:00.491 --> 01:09:02.359
It's your turn.

01:09:02.393 --> 01:09:04.328
Supposed to look out for her.

01:09:04.361 --> 01:09:06.564
You're a suck, just
'cause you fancy her.

01:09:06.595 --> 01:09:07.764
I'm not to a suck.

01:09:07.796 --> 01:09:09.133
You are.

01:09:09.166 --> 01:09:10.468
She's got inside your head.

01:09:10.501 --> 01:09:11.335
Who?

01:09:11.368 --> 01:09:12.203
The witch.

01:09:12.236 --> 01:09:12.868
She's not a witch.

01:09:12.902 --> 01:09:14.205
Witch Witch witch.

01:09:14.238 --> 01:09:15.238
She's not a wit-

01:09:15.272 --> 01:09:16.307
Witch witch witch.

01:09:16.340 --> 01:09:17.174
Lying witch.

01:09:17.207 --> 01:09:19.210
Shut up, shut up!
She's not a witch.

01:09:19.243 --> 01:09:21.412
She's a liar. You
can't even see it.

01:09:21.444 --> 01:09:22.845
You're the liar.

01:09:24.348 --> 01:09:28.252
She's a liar Frank, and
you're too stupid to see it.

01:09:28.285 --> 01:09:29.587
You're just jealous.

01:09:29.618 --> 01:09:31.621
Jealous? Why would I be jealous?

01:09:31.654 --> 01:09:34.390
Because you haven't got a mom.

01:09:38.462 --> 01:09:40.397
She is a liar.

01:09:40.430 --> 01:09:41.865
She's a liar because
your dad's dead

01:09:41.898 --> 01:09:44.502
and she hasn't even told you.

01:09:45.402 --> 01:09:47.871
What's are you talking about?

01:09:49.671 --> 01:09:51.875
What are you talking about?

01:09:52.742 --> 01:09:56.646
Edie what are you talking
about? My dads fine.

01:09:56.679 --> 01:09:57.814
He's not dead.

01:10:00.384 --> 01:10:02.253
Edie. He's not dead.

01:10:02.286 --> 01:10:03.420
Say something.

01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:12.296
Edie say something!

01:10:20.004 --> 01:10:21.539
What on earth?

01:10:22.906 --> 01:10:25.708
Is this what you had?

01:10:25.742 --> 01:10:26.776
I'm sorry?

01:10:26.809 --> 01:10:28.845
From the evacuee camp was
it a letter like this?

01:10:28.878 --> 01:10:29.846
From the Ministry?

01:10:29.879 --> 01:10:31.881
You can't around turning
up at people's houses-

01:10:31.915 --> 01:10:35.718
Just tell me how you knew when
they chose you, for Cassie.

01:10:35.752 --> 01:10:37.254
When they chose us?

01:10:37.288 --> 01:10:38.389
When they picked you.

01:10:38.422 --> 01:10:42.259
They don't pick
you, you volunteer,

01:10:42.293 --> 01:10:44.662
We volunteered, like you did.

01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:51.935
Think carefully. Is
anywhere or anyone

01:10:51.969 --> 01:10:54.938
he'd want to go to,
other than his mother

01:11:05.349 --> 01:11:06.749
He wouldn't.

01:11:06.783 --> 01:11:09.320
There's a 218, to London
but it's always late.

01:11:09.353 --> 01:11:10.554
We need to run.

01:11:29.739 --> 01:11:32.676
Edie, why aren't you in school?

01:11:32.710 --> 01:11:33.577
Edie?

01:11:34.944 --> 01:11:35.878
You haven't.

01:11:35.912 --> 01:11:36.813
Haven't what?

01:11:36.846 --> 01:11:39.984
You haven't. Edie, you
haven't told him.

01:11:40.017 --> 01:11:40.883
Where is he?

01:11:40.917 --> 01:11:41.751
Ms Lamb.

01:11:41.784 --> 01:11:42.620
What is going on?

01:11:42.653 --> 01:11:44.754
Where is he Edie?

01:11:44.787 --> 01:11:46.590
You're certain he
was on the train?

01:11:46.624 --> 01:11:48.925
Yeah, the station master
said there was a boy.

01:11:48.959 --> 01:11:50.628
But how could he
allow him on board,

01:11:50.661 --> 01:11:52.696
on his own, its policy.

01:11:52.730 --> 01:11:54.897
Look, this will take
you hours to drive,

01:11:54.931 --> 01:11:57.434
and it isn't safe. There
must be some other way.

01:11:57.468 --> 01:11:58.469
Like what?

01:12:00.937 --> 01:12:04.308
Poor child, he could be
anywhere.

01:12:48.818 --> 01:12:50.754
No no, that's my son.

01:12:58.662 --> 01:12:59.530
Wait!

01:13:04.068 --> 01:13:05.402
Hurry!

01:13:05.436 --> 01:13:06.103
Frank!

01:13:16.747 --> 01:13:17.614
Frank!

01:13:18.716 --> 01:13:19.750
What on Earth?
Do you mind?

01:14:36.994 --> 01:14:37.861
Frank,

01:14:40.264 --> 01:14:41.131
Frank.

01:14:43.500 --> 01:14:44.768
Sir, sir.

01:14:44.802 --> 01:14:45.736
Yes ma'am?

01:14:45.769 --> 01:14:47.137
Who was in the house?
We've come to help.

01:14:47.171 --> 01:14:48.772
I don't know nothing ma'am.

01:14:48.806 --> 01:14:50.240
But the neighbor, someone
must have seen, must know.

01:14:50.274 --> 01:14:51.208
His mother lives here.

01:14:51.241 --> 01:14:52.676
You'll just have to
wait like everyone else.

01:14:52.709 --> 01:14:53.377
How long?

01:14:53.410 --> 01:14:55.112
It takes time I don't know.

01:14:55.145 --> 01:14:56.647
Days most likely.

01:14:56.680 --> 01:14:59.650
Six streets here in
London last night.

01:14:59.683 --> 01:15:03.887
Tell you what. Leave your
details, and go on ma'am.

01:15:05.789 --> 01:15:06.790
I'm sorry.

01:15:10.727 --> 01:15:13.730
Everyone, find
shelter, now! Now!

01:15:52.669 --> 01:15:57.674
They promised to telephone.
The moment they hear anything.

01:16:00.077 --> 01:16:00.944
Frank.

01:16:02.981 --> 01:16:05.782
She wouldn't want you to be here

01:16:07.651 --> 01:16:09.988
in London where it isn't safe

01:16:13.757 --> 01:16:15.292
Come with me for her.

01:16:18.028 --> 01:16:18.896
Please.

01:16:38.649 --> 01:16:40.918
Shall we have the wire song.

01:16:52.030 --> 01:16:52.863
Stop the car!

01:16:52.896 --> 01:16:53.730
What?

01:16:53.764 --> 01:16:54.966
Stop the car!

01:16:57.100 --> 01:16:57.969
Frank!

01:17:02.406 --> 01:17:03.273
Frank!

01:17:07.844 --> 01:17:08.712
Frank!

01:17:17.821 --> 01:17:18.689
Frank.

01:17:23.327 --> 01:17:24.194
Frank

01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:42.946
Frank!

01:17:46.383 --> 01:17:47.250
Frank!

01:17:48.151 --> 01:17:49.286
It isn't safe!

01:17:53.423 --> 01:17:56.193
You knew, and you didn't say!

01:17:56.226 --> 01:17:58.161
I wanted to tell you,

01:18:00.330 --> 01:18:01.932
I didn't know how.

01:18:04.835 --> 01:18:05.702
I felt it.

01:18:06.403 --> 01:18:07.270
I saw him.

01:18:08.472 --> 01:18:10.273
My dad in Summerland.

01:18:11.308 --> 01:18:12.175
I saw him.

01:18:14.012 --> 01:18:14.878
There.

01:18:49.913 --> 01:18:50.781
Frank!

01:18:52.150 --> 01:18:53.017
Frank

01:20:18.236 --> 01:20:19.103
Here.

01:20:24.508 --> 01:20:25.909
Can I sit down?

01:20:39.957 --> 01:20:40.824
Frank,

01:20:43.860 --> 01:20:44.528
I'm sorry.

01:20:55.472 --> 01:20:57.008
I lost my father.

01:20:59.177 --> 01:21:01.845
He was on the Majestic.

01:21:01.878 --> 01:21:05.082
One of the greatest
ships in the fleet.

01:21:08.286 --> 01:21:10.420
One of the hardest things was

01:21:10.453 --> 01:21:12.990
we didn't know how to grieve.

01:21:14.091 --> 01:21:15.358
He was just gone

01:21:18.296 --> 01:21:19.163
out there.

01:21:23.201 --> 01:21:24.068
War.

01:21:28.471 --> 01:21:31.541
You know, he loved
stories of the sea.

01:21:34.644 --> 01:21:35.512
Norseman.

01:21:38.149 --> 01:21:43.087
He said, when a Viking died,
they lay them on their boat,

01:21:44.021 --> 01:21:48.092
set it ablaze and sent
it out into the waves.

01:21:48.125 --> 01:21:50.627
The fire freed their spirit,

01:21:50.660 --> 01:21:54.332
so it would float
away to paradise.

01:21:54.364 --> 01:21:56.566
So we built a boat for him.

01:21:59.170 --> 01:22:00.904
What sort of boat?

01:22:03.373 --> 01:22:05.442
Out of paper and sticks.

01:22:06.543 --> 01:22:09.313
We waited till it was dark.

01:22:09.347 --> 01:22:13.084
Then we set it alight and
let it sail out to see.

01:22:13.117 --> 01:22:16.453
Watched till the last
embers burned away.

01:22:17.621 --> 01:22:21.225
I suppose it is our
way of saying goodbye.

01:22:25.395 --> 01:22:26.264
Go on.

01:22:52.089 --> 01:22:55.425
I know you might not
be here, for long.

01:22:56.360 --> 01:22:57.962
But while you are,

01:22:59.063 --> 01:22:59.930
it's yours.

01:23:26.023 --> 01:23:27.358
What sort of planes that?

01:23:27.391 --> 01:23:28.458
Tiger morf.

01:23:29.659 --> 01:23:32.063
Once, I went in the cockpit?

01:23:32.096 --> 01:23:33.364
Did your mother know?

01:23:33.397 --> 01:23:36.300
No. She's scared of planes.

01:23:36.334 --> 01:23:37.534
She likes cars.

01:23:41.439 --> 01:23:43.640
Do you have a favorite one?

01:23:46.344 --> 01:23:47.211
Here.

01:24:14.372 --> 01:24:16.207
Round or straight?

01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:17.441
Round please.

01:24:18.675 --> 01:24:20.211
Knock knock.

01:24:20.244 --> 01:24:21.745
Sullivan!

01:24:21.778 --> 01:24:24.115
I just wanted to check on
the return of the native.

01:24:24.148 --> 01:24:27.351
Quite an adventure
you've had, eh?

01:24:27.385 --> 01:24:29.153
Miss Lamb, I wonder if um-

01:24:29.186 --> 01:24:33.190
We need more sticks,
would you go fetch some?

01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:38.762
Yes, Um. I hope you don't mind.

01:24:39.763 --> 01:24:44.667
I know what you're going to
say. I know it was wrong.

01:24:44.701 --> 01:24:46.703
But I couldn't tell him.

01:24:49.507 --> 01:24:52.776
These things don't
come naturally to me.

01:24:54.178 --> 01:24:58.382
Nobody knows how to be a
parent, especially now.

01:24:58.416 --> 01:25:02.386
We all just muddle
through as best we can.

01:25:02.420 --> 01:25:06.190
Buy you two. Well, I never
thought I live to say it

01:25:06.223 --> 01:25:08.758
but gosh, you make quite a pair.

01:25:11.628 --> 01:25:14.664
He has a great deal
to cope with now.

01:25:14.697 --> 01:25:16.633
He's going to need you.

01:25:17.634 --> 01:25:20.504
You're doing a
grand job, Miss Lamb.

01:25:20.538 --> 01:25:22.139
Alice.

01:25:22.173 --> 01:25:22.839
Alice.

01:25:25.675 --> 01:25:27.610
Who would have thought it?

01:25:27.644 --> 01:25:28.479
Yeah better watch out or

01:25:28.512 --> 01:25:30.114
they'll send you a
whole train load.

01:25:30.147 --> 01:25:31.714
No, no, I absolutely can't!

01:25:31.748 --> 01:25:35.553
I'm joking. I'm joking.
They wouldn't dare.

01:25:52.570 --> 01:25:54.771
You left the lights on?

01:25:54.804 --> 01:25:56.140
No I didn't.

01:26:13.790 --> 01:26:14.657
Mommy!

01:26:16.227 --> 01:26:16.893
Frank!

01:26:16.926 --> 01:26:17.794
Mommy.

01:26:42.219 --> 01:26:43.354
Hello Alice.

01:26:54.965 --> 01:26:57.434
We've been making a plane.

01:27:00.703 --> 01:27:02.506
What sort of plane?

01:27:07.611 --> 01:27:09.213
One like daddy's.

01:27:10.713 --> 01:27:11.714
It's for him.

01:27:15.519 --> 01:27:17.321
It isn't finished yet.

01:28:46.809 --> 01:28:48.012
I'm so sorry,

01:28:49.079 --> 01:28:50.748
about your husband.

01:28:56.487 --> 01:28:57.488
Thank you.

01:28:59.023 --> 01:29:00.958
For keeping Frank safe.

01:29:03.394 --> 01:29:06.597
I just knew if anything
happened to us.

01:29:08.798 --> 01:29:13.103
You were the only one I
trust to take care of him.

01:29:13.137 --> 01:29:14.871
He could have died

01:29:17.608 --> 01:29:19.809
if I hadn't been so stupid.

01:29:22.713 --> 01:29:24.048
I'm sorry for you.

01:29:24.081 --> 01:29:24.947
Al,

01:29:26.650 --> 01:29:28.319
you saved his life.

01:29:32.790 --> 01:29:33.657
Thank you.

01:29:36.760 --> 01:29:37.628
I'm sorry.

01:29:44.968 --> 01:29:48.472
There was a tea cloth,
somewhere.

01:29:48.505 --> 01:29:52.710
You could use a handkerchief,
like normal person.

01:30:46.563 --> 01:30:47.631
Bugger off.

01:30:49.899 --> 01:30:53.670
Are you rewriting again?
He'll be here any minute.

01:30:53.704 --> 01:30:57.508
Well just go away and
stop distracting me.

01:30:57.541 --> 01:30:59.443
I like distracting you.

01:30:59.476 --> 01:31:00.144
Oh.

01:31:01.944 --> 01:31:05.449
Look at this. I might
enjoy this one.

01:31:07.050 --> 01:31:10.821
Not when you see how
I've written you.

01:31:10.854 --> 01:31:15.826
I thought I'd be the heroine,
tracking you down. Like Pyro.

01:31:15.859 --> 01:31:18.862
Oh really? You stumbled
into a bookshop,

01:31:18.896 --> 01:31:21.498
make one call to a publisher.

01:31:21.532 --> 01:31:23.534
It hardly qualifies you
as the Agatha Christy.

01:31:23.567 --> 01:31:27.638
Stumbled. There was nothing
accidental about it.

01:31:29.506 --> 01:31:32.509
It was the 23rd
shop I'd tracked.

01:31:39.216 --> 01:31:41.485
You never told me that.

01:31:46.023 --> 01:31:46.890
Come on.

01:31:50.794 --> 01:31:52.863
I'll catch you up.

01:32:40.177 --> 01:32:41.778
I finished it.

01:32:41.812 --> 01:32:44.181
Would you believe it?

01:32:44.214 --> 01:32:45.949
Can I have a look?

01:33:05.702 --> 01:33:06.570
Come on.

01:33:07.371 --> 01:33:09.573
I thought we go for chips

01:33:29.088 --> 01:33:34.088
