WEBVTT

00:07.007 --> 00:08.269
Ah!

00:08.341 --> 00:10.138
Surprised?

00:16.683 --> 00:18.048
What's wrong?

00:18.118 --> 00:21.576
Can't figure out
why l'm still not running, huh?

00:21.654 --> 00:23.383
Can't read my thoughts?

00:28.028 --> 00:30.496
Go ahead. Attack!

00:30.563 --> 00:32.463
Take my ship.

00:32.531 --> 00:33.794
Damn ship!

00:33.867 --> 00:35.459
Hold together.

00:35.568 --> 00:36.762
Hold.

00:39.439 --> 00:43.068
Ah! Ah!

00:45.000 --> 00:51.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

02:45.832 --> 02:47.163
Wormhole?

02:48.401 --> 02:50.062
Approximately
400 million kilometers

02:50.170 --> 02:51.364
from our current position.

02:51.471 --> 02:53.132
Take a look at the
transkinetic vector.

02:53.239 --> 02:56.265
lt leads to Sector 001.

02:56.376 --> 02:57.638
lt looks like a wormhole,

02:57.710 --> 03:00.270
but we're detecting
massive bioplasmic activity.

03:00.346 --> 03:01.608
That suggests a life-form.

03:01.681 --> 03:03.114
Neutrino flux?

03:03.183 --> 03:04.445
Erratic.

03:04.517 --> 03:06.610
A direct route
to Earth's doorstep

03:06.686 --> 03:07.880
out of the blue.

03:08.021 --> 03:10.046
What's wrong with this picture?

03:10.123 --> 03:11.784
We should launch a probe.

03:11.858 --> 03:13.223
Go to Yellow Alert.

03:13.293 --> 03:15.261
Prepare a class-5 probe.

03:15.328 --> 03:17.819
Let's see
what's really out there.

03:20.667 --> 03:22.532
Daily Log, Seven of Nine.

03:22.635 --> 03:25.035
While we failed to locate
a new source of deuterium,

03:25.104 --> 03:26.765
our mission had
educational value

03:26.873 --> 03:28.807
for at least
one member of the crew.

03:30.777 --> 03:32.142
lf you go looking
for deuterium tomorrow,

03:32.212 --> 03:33.304
can l come?

03:33.379 --> 03:35.574
Well, that's up to the Captain.

03:35.648 --> 03:38.708
lt's likely you'll be replaced
by a more experienced officer.

03:38.785 --> 03:40.446
But this is
my first away mission

03:40.520 --> 03:42.181
and l didn't get
to do anything.

03:42.255 --> 03:43.517
l disagree.

03:43.590 --> 03:46.218
You familiarized yourself
with this vessel.

03:46.292 --> 03:49.227
Well, can't we make first
contact with somebody

03:49.295 --> 03:50.819
or get in a space battle?

03:50.897 --> 03:51.921
Yeah...

03:51.998 --> 03:52.930
can't we?

03:52.999 --> 03:54.432
Another time, perhaps.

03:55.768 --> 03:57.827
Hey, Naomi,
you want to take the helm?

03:57.937 --> 03:58.869
Can l?

03:58.938 --> 03:59.870
Ensign.

03:59.939 --> 04:01.304
She'll be familiarizing herself

04:01.407 --> 04:02.874
with the vessel.

04:03.009 --> 04:04.271
Here.

04:04.344 --> 04:05.777
Okay.

04:05.845 --> 04:08.871
First, bring us up
to one-quarter impulse.

04:08.948 --> 04:11.314
Hit this control,
then that one.

04:12.685 --> 04:14.209
One-quarter impulse, aye.

04:14.287 --> 04:17.620
Now, you think you can chart
a course back to Voyager?.

04:17.690 --> 04:18.815
Yes, sir.

04:31.571 --> 04:32.629
They're in a hurry.

04:32.739 --> 04:33.899
Crewmen Boylen and White--

04:34.073 --> 04:35.938
frequently late
for their duty shifts.

04:36.075 --> 04:37.508
Ah.

04:37.577 --> 04:39.943
Speaking of late,
l'll make a deal with you.

04:40.079 --> 04:41.376
l'll explain to Sam

04:41.447 --> 04:43.915
why her daughter's
two hours late for bedtime

04:43.983 --> 04:45.848
if you start
on the survey report.

04:45.918 --> 04:47.180
Acceptable.

04:47.253 --> 04:48.379
Have fun.

04:56.062 --> 04:57.154
You're back.

04:57.230 --> 04:58.663
l was beginning to worry.

04:58.731 --> 05:01.063
The survey took longer
than expected.

05:01.134 --> 05:03.432
Lucky our deuterium shortage
is no longer an issue.

05:04.837 --> 05:05.963
A wormhole.

05:06.072 --> 05:07.232
The wormhole.

05:07.340 --> 05:09.433
lt leads all the way
back to Earth.

05:09.542 --> 05:11.874
The odds of finding
such a phenomenon

05:11.944 --> 05:13.138
are infinitesimal.

05:13.212 --> 05:15.407
Never bet against the house.

05:19.018 --> 05:20.280
What are you doing?

05:20.353 --> 05:22.150
Looking for anomalous readings.

05:22.221 --> 05:23.882
You will find none.

05:23.956 --> 05:25.685
He's right--
no subspatial contortions,

05:25.758 --> 05:26.850
no temporal variance.

05:26.926 --> 05:28.416
The probe we sent in has already

05:28.494 --> 05:30.621
picked up faint signals
from the other side.

05:30.697 --> 05:32.392
B'Elanna's still
downloading them,

05:32.465 --> 05:34.831
but she's pretty sure
they're from Starfleet.

05:34.901 --> 05:37.665
This wormhole is only
300 million kilometers away.

05:37.770 --> 05:40.432
Long-range scans
should've detected it days ago.

05:40.540 --> 05:42.508
Perhaps it was
an oversight on your part.

05:42.608 --> 05:45.634
lf it'll make you feel
better, run a diagnostic.

05:45.712 --> 05:48.203
ln the meantime,
let's maintain course.

06:04.897 --> 06:07.058
Come in.

06:07.133 --> 06:08.828
l've completed my diagnostic.

06:08.935 --> 06:10.926
Sensors are operating
at peak efficiency.

06:11.037 --> 06:12.163
Then there's nothing
to worry about.

06:12.271 --> 06:13.465
On the contrary.

06:13.573 --> 06:16.133
The wormhole's neutrino levels
are extremely erratic.

06:16.242 --> 06:18.005
l thought so, too...

06:18.077 --> 06:20.170
until l received this.

06:20.246 --> 06:22.646
lt turns out those faint signals
we detected

06:22.715 --> 06:24.410
were communiquÃ©s from Starfleet.

06:24.484 --> 06:27.783
They assure me the neutrino flux
is nothing to worry about.

06:27.854 --> 06:29.014
Starfleet may be in error.

06:29.088 --> 06:30.350
We should run further scans.

06:30.423 --> 06:33.881
No time.
The wormhole might destabilize.

06:33.960 --> 06:36.986
The Doctor often instructs me
''to look before l leap.''

06:37.063 --> 06:40.999
lt is an antiquated adage,
but l believe it is relevant.

06:41.067 --> 06:42.500
l have another one for you--

06:42.602 --> 06:44.035
''He who hesitates is lost.''

06:44.103 --> 06:45.195
Captain...

06:45.304 --> 06:47.772
l think we're avoiding
the real issue here, Seven.

06:47.840 --> 06:49.364
You're still feeling
uncomfortable

06:49.475 --> 06:51.272
about returning
to the Alpha Quadrant.

06:51.344 --> 06:52.777
lt's nothing to be ashamed of.

06:52.845 --> 06:55.780
Trust me. You're going
to thrive on Earth

06:55.848 --> 06:58.282
just as you've thrived
on Voyager.

06:59.352 --> 07:00.250
Yes?

07:01.287 --> 07:03.152
Letter number two.

07:03.222 --> 07:05.213
l'm getting jealous.

07:08.127 --> 07:10.561
Mark.

07:10.630 --> 07:13.121
Apparently his engagement
was broken off.

07:13.199 --> 07:14.666
What about you?
Any news?

07:14.767 --> 07:17.167
A full pardon and
reinstatement to Starfleet.

07:17.236 --> 07:19.204
l've even been offered
a professorship

07:19.272 --> 07:20.830
in anthropology at the Academy.

07:20.973 --> 07:24.136
Oh, Chakotay, congratulations,
but it's not fair.

07:24.210 --> 07:25.871
Don't worry.
lt's only part-time.

07:25.978 --> 07:27.969
How am l expected to run
a ship without you?

07:28.047 --> 07:29.708
You'll do fine.

07:38.858 --> 07:40.792
Computer, access all log entries

07:40.860 --> 07:43.590
recorded by Captain Janeway
on stardate 52542.

07:43.663 --> 07:46.689
Access to those files
is restricted.

07:59.312 --> 08:01.212
Access granted.

08:03.416 --> 08:05.350
Play first log entry.

08:05.418 --> 08:09.582
Captain's Log, Stardate 52542.3.

08:09.655 --> 08:12.647
Long-range sensors have
identified a wormhole

08:12.725 --> 08:14.386
leading to the Alpha Quadrant.

08:14.460 --> 08:17.327
Unfortunately,
secondary scans have revealed

08:17.396 --> 08:19.694
that it's some kind
of elaborate deception.

08:19.765 --> 08:21.756
The question is:

08:21.868 --> 08:25.133
Who's attempting to deceive us
and why?

08:26.572 --> 08:28.005
Play next log entry.

08:28.074 --> 08:29.769
Captain's Log, supplemental.

08:29.842 --> 08:33.835
We've begun to receive
faint telemetry from our probe.

08:33.913 --> 08:36.780
l don't want to get
the crew's hopes up,

08:36.849 --> 08:40.979
but B'Elanna thinks it may be
a message from Starfleet.

08:41.053 --> 08:42.543
l'm beginning to wonder

08:42.621 --> 08:44.783
if my earlier skepticism
was justified.

08:46.192 --> 08:47.454
Play next log entry.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.017
Captain's Log, supplemental.

08:49.095 --> 08:51.655
l've set a course
for the wormhole.

08:51.731 --> 08:55.792
With any luck, we should be
back in the Alpha Quadrant

08:55.902 --> 08:57.870
in a matter of days.

09:04.744 --> 09:06.211
Annika!

09:06.312 --> 09:07.904
Annika Hansen!

09:07.980 --> 09:09.777
There is no one here
by that name.

09:09.849 --> 09:10.816
Are you sure?

09:10.883 --> 09:12.908
Because l have a letter
here addressed to her.

09:15.621 --> 09:16.553
l never realized

09:16.622 --> 09:18.647
you knew anyone
from the Alpha Quadrant.

09:18.724 --> 09:19.656
l don't.

09:19.725 --> 09:21.955
Well, it looks like
someone knows you.

09:22.028 --> 09:24.121
Who's it from?

09:26.198 --> 09:27.825
Claudia Hansen.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.831
She claims to be
a sister of my father.

09:30.002 --> 09:31.867
Your aunt.

09:32.004 --> 09:34.529
She is looking forward
to meeting me.

09:34.640 --> 09:36.972
That's great!

09:37.043 --> 09:38.704
Starfleet's appointed me

09:38.778 --> 09:40.803
Ambassador
to the Lan'Tuan sector.

09:40.880 --> 09:42.142
Ambassador?

09:42.214 --> 09:46.207
l guess they thought l'd
have a flair for quadrupeds.

10:00.533 --> 10:03.297
Ensign, l require
a moment of your time.

10:03.402 --> 10:05.131
Sure.

10:05.237 --> 10:06.704
Have you noticed
anything unusual

10:06.772 --> 10:09.036
about the crew's behavior
since we returned?

10:09.108 --> 10:11.042
Like...?

10:11.110 --> 10:12.907
When l presented
the Captain with evidence

10:12.979 --> 10:15.140
that the wormhole may not
be what it appears to be,

10:15.214 --> 10:16.647
she seemed unconcerned.

10:16.716 --> 10:19.241
Really? That doesn't
sound like her.

10:19.318 --> 10:20.250
l believe the crew

10:20.319 --> 10:22.048
is being deceived
by false telemetry,

10:22.121 --> 10:24.316
as well as overly-optimistic
correspondence.

10:24.390 --> 10:26.324
The letters from home?

10:26.392 --> 10:28.326
l got one, too.

10:28.394 --> 10:30.328
No doubt containing good news.

10:30.396 --> 10:31.863
Oh, l'll say.

10:31.931 --> 10:33.865
An old buddy of mine
offered me a spot

10:33.933 --> 10:36.060
at the new test flight center
in Australia.

10:36.168 --> 10:38.102
Beautiful beaches,

10:38.170 --> 10:41.469
a chance to pilot
the latest experimental ships.

10:41.540 --> 10:42.768
l can't believe it.

10:42.842 --> 10:44.833
Then you doubt the veracity
of the letters as well.

10:44.944 --> 10:46.878
Are you kidding?

10:46.946 --> 10:50.143
l've already written back
and accepted the job.

10:57.456 --> 10:59.481
Computer, activate the EMH.

10:59.558 --> 11:01.856
Please state the nature
of the medical emergency.

11:01.961 --> 11:03.929
The wormhole is not
what it appears to be.

11:04.030 --> 11:05.725
l believe that the crew
is being...

11:05.798 --> 11:07.231
Hold on. Wormhole?

11:07.299 --> 11:08.596
You weren't informed.

11:08.701 --> 11:09.998
Not a peep.

11:10.102 --> 11:11.899
Considering
everyone's recent behavior,

11:12.071 --> 11:13.504
that's not surprising.

11:13.572 --> 11:15.164
Since the discovery
of this wormhole,

11:15.274 --> 11:18.038
the crew has ignored obvious
signs that it's a deception.

11:18.110 --> 11:20.101
You must determine if there is
a physiological explanation.

11:20.179 --> 11:21.942
Seven of Nine to the Bridge.

11:22.014 --> 11:24.278
On my way.

11:24.350 --> 11:27.615
l'll call in a few crewmen
for routine examinations.

11:27.687 --> 11:30.713
That should allow me to run
the necessary diagnostics.

11:37.029 --> 11:38.690
We've just entered
visual range.

11:38.764 --> 11:40.698
l thought you'd like
to take a look.

11:40.766 --> 11:44.725
We're starting to get images
from the other side.

11:44.837 --> 11:46.828
There is
considerable interference.

11:47.940 --> 11:50.704
l think l can help clear it up.

11:53.112 --> 11:54.409
Try it now.

12:12.765 --> 12:14.494
How long
until we reach the wormhole?

12:15.601 --> 12:17.432
53 minutes.

12:17.536 --> 12:18.901
Maintain course.

12:19.972 --> 12:22.304
All hands, this is the Bridge.

12:22.374 --> 12:23.705
Secure all systems.

12:23.776 --> 12:26.540
When we reach Earth's orbit,
lay in a descent trajectory,

12:26.612 --> 12:29.877
North American continent,
Starfleet Headquarters.

12:40.392 --> 12:42.087
Computer,
perform a gravimetric scan

12:42.161 --> 12:44.095
of the wormhole's interior.

12:44.163 --> 12:46.495
Look for inconsistencies
in the spatial gradient.

12:46.565 --> 12:49.728
The anomaly is consistent
with a class-1 wormhole.

12:49.835 --> 12:51.325
No irregularities detected.

12:51.437 --> 12:54.463
Recalibrate sensors
and try again.

12:54.573 --> 12:57.041
No irregularities detected.

12:59.278 --> 13:01.906
lsolate grid 925 and magnify.

13:03.816 --> 13:07.479
Computer, is that a vessel
in grid 91?

13:07.553 --> 13:09.145
No vessel has been detected.

13:11.123 --> 13:12.647
Open a com channel.

13:12.725 --> 13:14.158
Channel open.

13:14.226 --> 13:16.990
Alien vessel,
this is the Starship Voyager.

13:17.062 --> 13:18.757
Respond.

13:18.831 --> 13:20.321
Alien vessel...

13:22.868 --> 13:24.597
Who are you?

13:24.703 --> 13:27.228
Seven of Nine,
Federation Starship Voyager.

13:27.339 --> 13:28.806
Our ship is
on an intercept course

13:28.874 --> 13:31.240
3.4 light-years
from your position.

13:31.310 --> 13:32.937
Turn around.

13:33.078 --> 13:35.911
You're being deceived.

13:35.981 --> 13:37.209
How?

13:37.283 --> 13:39.183
He knows what you want.

13:45.624 --> 13:48.593
Computer, identify the cause
of the power failure.

13:48.661 --> 13:50.720
Captain's orders.

13:50.796 --> 13:52.525
Power from Astrometrics
has been rerouted

13:52.598 --> 13:55.089
to the navigational array,
at least until we've completed

13:55.201 --> 13:56.566
our journey
through the wormhole.

13:56.669 --> 13:59.604
l've made contact with a vessel
inside the anomaly.

13:59.672 --> 14:00.798
Starfleet?

14:00.906 --> 14:01.930
Alien.

14:02.041 --> 14:04.032
The pilot attempted
to warn us away.

14:09.048 --> 14:12.677
Sensors show no record
of an incoming transmission.

14:12.751 --> 14:14.378
The sensors are malfunctioning.

14:14.453 --> 14:16.148
He said we were being deceived,

14:16.222 --> 14:18.713
that the wormhole is not
what it appears to be.

14:18.791 --> 14:21.191
The preponderance of data
suggests otherwise.

14:21.260 --> 14:22.750
The data is flawed.

14:22.828 --> 14:24.989
As is your reasoning.

14:26.765 --> 14:29.063
May l ask you
a personal question?

14:31.303 --> 14:33.771
Are you looking forward
to seeing your wife and family?

14:33.873 --> 14:35.704
lndeed.

14:35.774 --> 14:39.403
And is that desire stronger
than you expected it to be?

14:39.478 --> 14:41.241
Your point?

14:41.313 --> 14:43.076
l believe
you are being manipulated.

14:43.148 --> 14:45.639
Someone or something
is compromising your logic.

14:45.718 --> 14:48.744
Otherwise, you would be willing
to listen to my concerns.

14:50.189 --> 14:52.157
Access to the Astrometrics Lab

14:52.224 --> 14:54.818
is restricted
until further notice.

14:56.829 --> 14:58.319
Dismissed.

15:48.681 --> 15:51.343
Naomi Wildman.

15:51.417 --> 15:53.544
Your presence here
is unauthorized.

15:53.619 --> 15:55.416
State your intentions.

15:55.487 --> 15:57.853
l'm... hiding.

15:57.923 --> 15:59.447
From whom?

15:59.525 --> 16:00.423
Everyone.

16:00.526 --> 16:02.221
They're all acting strange.

16:02.261 --> 16:03.728
Even Mom.

16:03.796 --> 16:05.661
Elaborate.

16:05.731 --> 16:08.097
She keeps smiling all the time,
talking about Earth

16:08.167 --> 16:10.294
like it's the greatest place
in the universe.

16:10.402 --> 16:13.963
You do not share your mother's
desire to return to Earth?

16:14.073 --> 16:15.870
Voyager's my home.

16:16.008 --> 16:19.603
lf we go to Earth,
l'll have to leave the ship.

16:19.678 --> 16:22.408
l'd miss my room, Neelix...

16:22.481 --> 16:25.939
you and l wouldn't be able
to play Kadis-Kot anymore.

16:29.254 --> 16:30.881
Curious.

16:31.023 --> 16:34.151
You and l appear to be
the only ones not affected.

16:34.226 --> 16:35.488
Affected by what?

16:35.561 --> 16:38.621
l am not certain.

16:38.697 --> 16:41.689
Stay here until l return.

16:52.578 --> 16:54.671
Computer, activate EMH.

16:54.747 --> 16:57.545
Please state the nature
of the medical emergency.

16:57.616 --> 16:58.947
Where's the Doctor?

16:59.018 --> 17:00.007
Off-line.

17:00.119 --> 17:01.177
Why?

17:01.220 --> 17:02.278
Starfleet orders--

17:02.354 --> 17:03.912
something about the wormhole

17:03.989 --> 17:06.287
interfering with
the holographic systems.

17:06.358 --> 17:08.348
They didn't want
to damage his program.

17:08.426 --> 17:09.621
He must be reactivated.

17:09.694 --> 17:12.185
No can do, not until we're
on the other side.

17:12.263 --> 17:13.560
lt's urgent.

17:13.632 --> 17:16.396
Believe it or not,
l am capable of handling

17:16.502 --> 17:19.198
almost any medical problem
you might have.

17:29.815 --> 17:32.215
l was just coming to see you.

17:32.284 --> 17:33.546
Why?

17:33.619 --> 17:36.213
l'm afraid l have
some troubling news.

17:36.288 --> 17:38.449
Evidently, our wormhole
passes through

17:38.524 --> 17:41.015
a layer of subspace
monitored by the Borg.

17:41.093 --> 17:44.085
Starfleet's concerned
that your neural transceiver

17:44.163 --> 17:46.131
might attract
some unwanted attention.

17:46.198 --> 17:48.029
We need to deactivate
your implants.

17:48.100 --> 17:49.624
You should not attempt to do so

17:49.735 --> 17:51.362
without the Doctor's
supervision.

17:51.470 --> 17:52.937
Unfortunately, he's off-line.

17:53.005 --> 17:54.700
Then the procedure
is inadvisable.

17:54.807 --> 17:57.298
Try to relax. We're only
going to keep you in stasis

17:57.409 --> 17:58.899
until we've reached
the Alpha Quadrant.

17:59.044 --> 18:00.341
l realize the prospect

18:00.446 --> 18:02.937
of returning to Earth
is frightening to you.

18:02.981 --> 18:06.007
lt's perfectly natural for you
to resist the unknown,

18:06.085 --> 18:07.552
but you're in good hands.

18:07.619 --> 18:10.247
Resistance is futile.

18:17.229 --> 18:18.992
What's our distance, Tom?

18:21.500 --> 18:24.060
2,000 kilometers and closing.

18:24.169 --> 18:27.832
Good-bye, Delta Quadrant.

18:28.006 --> 18:31.942
No more Hirogen hunting parties,
Malon garbage scows.

18:32.044 --> 18:33.272
By this time tomorrow,

18:33.345 --> 18:37.179
it'll be Cardassians,
Romulans, Ferengi...

18:37.249 --> 18:38.841
Chakotay to the Bridge.

18:38.917 --> 18:40.077
Go ahead.

18:40.152 --> 18:41.813
l've spoken to Seven of Nine.

18:41.887 --> 18:43.650
We're putting her into stasis.

18:43.722 --> 18:44.814
Well, make it fast.

18:44.890 --> 18:48.223
We don't want the Borg to crash
our welcome home party.

18:51.063 --> 18:54.032
l need to adjust
my regeneration parameters.

18:58.470 --> 19:00.131
How long will l remain inactive?

19:00.239 --> 19:03.106
A couple of hours
to be on the safe side.

19:10.449 --> 19:12.280
Security alert!

19:14.786 --> 19:16.947
Naomi Wildman.

19:20.559 --> 19:21.548
Security's on their way,

19:21.627 --> 19:23.322
Chakotay.
What happened?

19:23.395 --> 19:26.831
Seven's trapped us behind
some kind of Borg force field.

19:26.899 --> 19:28.423
Try to disable it.

19:30.569 --> 19:32.093
Naomi...

19:32.204 --> 19:33.796
go back to your quarters.

19:33.906 --> 19:35.134
Pay attention to me.

19:35.207 --> 19:37.038
lf this indicator
begins to flash,

19:37.109 --> 19:39.339
enter the following
series of commands.

19:39.411 --> 19:41.402
Watch carefully.

19:41.480 --> 19:42.174
Naomi.

19:42.247 --> 19:44.681
Do you understand?

19:44.750 --> 19:46.650
Yes.

19:46.718 --> 19:48.185
Naomi...

19:48.253 --> 19:50.187
l'm giving you a direct order.

19:50.255 --> 19:52.450
Step away from the console.

20:00.265 --> 20:01.892
She's blocking my commands.

20:03.502 --> 20:05.299
Keep trying.

20:10.275 --> 20:12.175
Computer, lock
onto my coordinates

20:12.244 --> 20:14.371
and initiate
a site-to-site transport.

20:14.446 --> 20:15.435
Main Engineering.

20:31.964 --> 20:33.431
Seven?

20:33.498 --> 20:35.363
l'm sorry.

20:45.677 --> 20:47.440
We've got phaser fire
in Engineering.

20:47.512 --> 20:49.002
Janeway to Security.

20:49.081 --> 20:52.517
Computer, erect a level-10
force field around Engineering.

20:52.584 --> 20:56.145
Lock out the command controls
with Borg encryption code 294.

20:56.221 --> 20:58.416
Seven's tapping
into the engine manifold.

20:58.490 --> 21:00.617
She's trying to shut down
impulse drive.

21:10.969 --> 21:12.630
Bridge.

21:12.738 --> 21:14.899
She has erected
another force field.

21:15.040 --> 21:17.270
lt will require several minutes
to deactivate it.

21:17.342 --> 21:19.936
Where is she exactly?

21:20.078 --> 21:23.411
Engineering Console 16-Beta.

21:23.482 --> 21:24.949
Captain?

21:25.017 --> 21:27.383
l'm sending an EM surge
to that station.

21:27.452 --> 21:31.650
Seven's going into stasis
whether she likes it or not.

21:37.095 --> 21:38.960
She's down, Captain.

21:39.031 --> 21:40.862
Captain...

21:40.932 --> 21:42.627
we're at the threshold.

21:42.734 --> 21:45.168
Take us in.

22:05.190 --> 22:06.157
Report.

22:06.224 --> 22:09.284
lt's just spatial turbulence.

22:09.361 --> 22:11.295
lt's beautiful.

22:21.206 --> 22:23.470
Steady as she goes.

25:00.298 --> 25:02.061
Seven, wake up.

25:03.168 --> 25:04.533
Seven of Nine.

25:04.636 --> 25:06.194
Wake up.

25:09.941 --> 25:11.238
Force field.

25:30.328 --> 25:31.795
You are damaged.

25:31.863 --> 25:33.660
lt's just a scrape.

25:33.732 --> 25:34.994
The crew?

25:36.568 --> 25:38.661
Unconscious. Sort of.

25:43.675 --> 25:45.609
Our hull is demolecularizing.

25:45.677 --> 25:47.702
Do wormholes do that?

25:49.281 --> 25:51.215
No... they don't.

25:51.283 --> 25:54.844
Return to your quarters
while l assess the situation.

25:54.920 --> 25:56.353
But l can help.

25:56.421 --> 25:59.879
My mom says two heads
are better than one.

25:59.958 --> 26:02.290
lsn't that
the Borg philosophy, too?

26:02.394 --> 26:05.124
Simplistic, but accurate.

26:05.163 --> 26:07.290
Please...
l don't want to be alone.

26:27.752 --> 26:29.276
Neelix!

26:34.125 --> 26:35.524
Oh, Neelix.

26:35.594 --> 26:38.722
He will survive.

26:41.399 --> 26:42.991
Neelix.

26:43.101 --> 26:44.625
We must keep moving.

26:47.072 --> 26:49.370
Naomi Wildman.

26:54.012 --> 26:56.674
We will return for him.

27:11.262 --> 27:14.356
l don't think that's Earth.

27:14.432 --> 27:15.626
No.

27:15.700 --> 27:17.668
So, where are we?

27:27.912 --> 27:30.176
l've restored partial systems.

27:31.716 --> 27:33.684
l'm reading
organic compounds,

27:33.752 --> 27:35.879
bioplasmic discharges,

27:35.987 --> 27:38.547
a vast network
of neural pathways.

27:38.623 --> 27:40.887
ls it a life-form?

27:40.959 --> 27:43.894
lf it is,
it's the largest l've seen--

27:43.995 --> 27:46.759
over 2,000 kilometers
in diameter.

27:49.868 --> 27:51.130
What are you doing?

27:51.236 --> 27:52.863
My earlier scans
revealed a vessel.

27:52.971 --> 27:54.336
l'm trying to find it again.

27:54.406 --> 27:56.465
Somebody else is stuck here?

27:56.574 --> 27:58.405
Possibly.

27:58.476 --> 28:00.000
There.

28:00.111 --> 28:02.602
lt's heavily damaged,
but still functioning.

28:02.647 --> 28:05.946
Alien vessel, respond.

28:07.018 --> 28:08.815
This is the Starship Voyager.

28:08.920 --> 28:10.410
Please respond.

28:14.426 --> 28:16.826
l told you to stay away.

28:16.928 --> 28:18.555
Why didn't you listen?

28:18.630 --> 28:20.928
Our crew believed they were
returning to their homes.

28:20.999 --> 28:24.560
Everything
they've always wanted, correct?

28:24.669 --> 28:26.637
Yes.

28:26.705 --> 28:28.400
He deceived them.

28:28.506 --> 28:30.474
''He''?

28:30.575 --> 28:32.270
l believe
we should work together

28:32.343 --> 28:33.605
to escape this anomaly.

28:33.678 --> 28:35.873
Lower your shields
and l'll beam you aboard.

28:36.014 --> 28:38.744
Shields are the only thing
holding my ship together.

28:38.817 --> 28:40.148
l'd be destroyed.

28:40.218 --> 28:42.618
l will enhance
your shield emitters.

28:42.687 --> 28:45.884
You won't fool me that easily.

28:46.024 --> 28:48.618
l assure you
we are not a deception.

28:48.693 --> 28:50.490
Oh, how convenient.

28:50.562 --> 28:54.396
An enormous starship
comes to my rescue.

28:54.466 --> 28:57.993
You might try
a more subtle approach.

28:58.103 --> 29:00.628
My scans indicate
that your shields will fail

29:00.739 --> 29:02.366
in approximately 15 minutes.

29:02.474 --> 29:05.238
Join us, or you can
remain on your vessel,

29:05.310 --> 29:07.676
secure in the knowledge
that you were not deceived,

29:07.746 --> 29:10.647
but that knowledge will do you
little good when you are dead.

29:13.151 --> 29:14.812
Decide now.

29:16.888 --> 29:18.822
All right.

29:20.492 --> 29:22.119
All right!

29:25.296 --> 29:28.265
l'm taking my shields down.

29:54.159 --> 29:55.592
Ow!

30:01.432 --> 30:04.890
You look real enough,
but over the years,

30:05.069 --> 30:09.506
he's made me believe
many things are real--

30:09.607 --> 30:11.939
a fortune at my fingertips,

30:12.076 --> 30:14.943
good friends
risen from the dead.

30:15.046 --> 30:18.038
You're referring to the anomaly
we've entered.

30:18.116 --> 30:21.051
''Anomaly''?

30:21.119 --> 30:22.416
lt's a beast.

30:22.487 --> 30:23.954
Cunning, deadly.

30:24.055 --> 30:25.818
What does it want?

30:25.890 --> 30:28.415
You...

30:28.493 --> 30:30.085
your ship...

30:30.161 --> 30:32.789
antimatter, biomatter.

30:32.864 --> 30:35.458
He consumes it.

30:35.533 --> 30:37.660
Everyone believed
it was a wormhole.

30:37.769 --> 30:39.862
Hmm, telepathy...

30:39.971 --> 30:42.235
psychogenic manipulation.

30:42.307 --> 30:45.640
He senses your thoughts,
your desires,

30:45.710 --> 30:48.110
and then he preys on them.

30:48.179 --> 30:49.669
Like a pitcher plant.

30:50.982 --> 30:52.381
Pitcher plant?

30:52.450 --> 30:54.748
The Doctor taught me about it
in botany class.

30:54.819 --> 30:58.311
lt catches insects
by mimicking pheromones.

30:58.389 --> 31:00.118
Yes, you're right,

31:00.225 --> 31:03.661
but this one
doesn't eat insects.

31:05.396 --> 31:08.991
He eats starships.

31:09.067 --> 31:11.661
You are familiar
with this life-form?

31:11.769 --> 31:15.603
Familiar? l've been hunting it
for nearly 40 years.

31:15.673 --> 31:18.039
And have you become impervious
to its telepathy?

31:18.109 --> 31:23.911
Almost, but there are days
when he can still trick me.

31:23.982 --> 31:25.847
Like yesterday.

31:25.917 --> 31:30.877
l thought l had found a way
to kill him once and for all.

31:30.955 --> 31:34.413
l'd allow him
to begin consuming my ship,

31:34.492 --> 31:39.486
and then l'd fly directly
to his most vulnerable system--

31:39.564 --> 31:42.397
his primary neural plexus. Boom!

31:42.467 --> 31:46.563
l'd destroy him
from the inside out.

31:46.671 --> 31:49.538
But he knew.

31:49.607 --> 31:54.943
He showed me
what l wanted to see.

31:55.013 --> 31:59.006
l was nowhere near
his neural plexus.

31:59.150 --> 32:03.644
l was flying directly
into his digestion chamber.

32:06.624 --> 32:09.559
And speaking of digestion...

32:09.627 --> 32:11.390
How do we get out
of the monster?

32:11.462 --> 32:12.895
lt's not a monster.

32:12.997 --> 32:15.795
lt's a bioplasmic organism,
and we will find a way out.

32:15.867 --> 32:17.357
No.

32:17.468 --> 32:20.096
The girl's right.

32:20.204 --> 32:22.104
He's a monster

32:22.173 --> 32:26.610
and the only way out
is to destroy him.

32:35.753 --> 32:38.187
Please state the nature
of the medical emergency.

32:38.256 --> 32:40.190
Your ship is being devoured.

32:40.258 --> 32:41.657
l'd say that's an emergency.

32:41.726 --> 32:45.093
The monster ate his ship, too.

32:45.163 --> 32:46.425
''Monster''?

32:46.497 --> 32:48.556
l want to see
your weapons manifest.

32:48.633 --> 32:49.691
''Weapons''?

32:49.767 --> 32:51.496
This is a Sick Bay,
not an arsenal.

32:51.602 --> 32:53.001
What's going on?

32:53.137 --> 32:55.605
Voyager has been lured
into the digestive chamber

32:55.673 --> 32:57.106
of a bioplasmic organism.

32:57.175 --> 32:59.541
We require your assistance
in charting an escape route.

32:59.610 --> 33:01.703
Slow down. The last
thing l remember

33:01.813 --> 33:03.747
l was speaking to Mr. Paris.

33:03.781 --> 33:05.874
He said the wormhole posed
a threat to my program.

33:05.950 --> 33:08.885
The beast has been
manipulating your crew.

33:08.953 --> 33:11.854
The moment he realized you were
beginning to suspect something,

33:11.923 --> 33:13.720
he made sure
you were deactivated.

33:13.791 --> 33:15.156
And who might you be?

33:15.226 --> 33:16.887
The local monster expert?

33:16.961 --> 33:20.055
As a matter of fact, l am.

33:20.131 --> 33:24.261
He's been fooling you for days,
creating false sensor readings,

33:24.369 --> 33:27.827
and he's been altering
your crew's thought patterns--

33:27.939 --> 33:32.035
a little neurogenic telepathy
to make them lower their guard.

33:32.110 --> 33:34.670
That might explain
the heightened dopamine levels

33:34.746 --> 33:37.442
l found during my ''routine
examinations'' of the crew.

33:37.515 --> 33:39.039
Have you informed the Captain?

33:39.117 --> 33:40.414
She's asleep.

33:40.485 --> 33:41.452
Asleep?

33:41.519 --> 33:43.214
lt's our proximity
to the creature.

33:43.287 --> 33:45.187
The neurogenic field
is stronger here.

33:45.256 --> 33:47.383
lt's already rendered
most of the crew unconscious.

33:47.458 --> 33:49.449
Does your vessel's database
contain information

33:49.527 --> 33:50.892
on the creature's anatomy?

33:50.962 --> 33:51.894
Of course.

33:51.963 --> 33:53.988
Retrieve it.

33:55.733 --> 33:59.726
ln the meantime, let's work
on a wake-up call for the crew.

34:13.951 --> 34:15.145
Computer, increase

34:15.219 --> 34:17.847
neurotransmitter levels
by 29 percent.

34:17.922 --> 34:19.321
A cortical inhibitor?

34:19.389 --> 34:22.655
l thought it might disrupt
the organism's hold on her.

34:22.726 --> 34:23.751
lt won't.

34:23.828 --> 34:25.989
l already tried
a similar procedure.

34:26.063 --> 34:28.658
l don't remember asking
for a second opinion.

34:29.734 --> 34:30.666
lt's working.

34:30.768 --> 34:32.429
She's regaining consciousness.

34:35.572 --> 34:37.438
Doctor.

34:37.507 --> 34:40.568
You're being exposed to
a powerful neurogenic field.

34:40.645 --> 34:43.136
You've been unconscious
for several hours.

34:46.484 --> 34:47.951
They're here.

34:48.018 --> 34:50.351
Who?

34:50.420 --> 34:52.855
The Maquis.
They're alive!

34:52.924 --> 34:54.755
B'Elanna,
you're still on Voyager.

34:54.826 --> 34:55.884
You're hallucinating.

34:55.960 --> 34:57.791
Starfleet thinks
you've all been killed.

34:57.862 --> 34:59.796
Computer, increase
neurotransmitter levels

34:59.864 --> 35:00.728
another ten percent.

35:00.832 --> 35:01.764
What happened?

35:01.799 --> 35:03.164
B'Elanna, focus on my voice.

35:03.267 --> 35:05.235
She doesn't want to.

35:13.177 --> 35:15.543
They never want to.

35:35.133 --> 35:38.398
lt's the silence l hate...

35:38.503 --> 35:42.530
the way he takes you
without a fight.

35:42.640 --> 35:45.541
lt was the same way
with the Nokaro.

35:45.610 --> 35:53.210
A crew of nearly 3,000--
families mostly, mine included--

35:53.284 --> 35:57.448
looking for
a new world to settle,

35:57.522 --> 36:00.889
but they came across
our friend here

36:00.992 --> 36:03.517
and he showed them
what they wanted to see--

36:03.594 --> 36:09.965
a glistening green paradise.

36:10.067 --> 36:13.628
By the time l responded
to their distress call,

36:13.738 --> 36:15.706
all that was left of them

36:15.806 --> 36:18.331
was some fading
engine emissions.

36:18.442 --> 36:21.411
That was 39 years ago.

36:21.479 --> 36:24.710
39 years, two weeks,
four days...

36:24.782 --> 36:26.409
Do you mind?

36:26.484 --> 36:28.111
The situation is dismal enough.

36:28.186 --> 36:32.122
l'm just trying to explain
who we're up against.

36:32.190 --> 36:34.658
Well, l'm getting
a pretty good idea on my own.

36:34.725 --> 36:36.158
Judging by these bio-scans,

36:36.227 --> 36:38.286
the organism's been
devouring life-forms

36:38.362 --> 36:40.023
for a bit longer than 39 years.

36:40.097 --> 36:42.258
l'd estimate
it's at least 200,000 years old.

36:42.333 --> 36:45.427
The intelligent always survive.

36:45.536 --> 36:46.901
l wouldn't go that far.

36:46.971 --> 36:49.462
lt appears to operate
on highly evolved instinct.

36:49.574 --> 36:51.769
l haven't detected
any signs of sentience.

36:51.842 --> 36:54.310
Oh, he's intelligent,
all right--

36:54.378 --> 36:58.474
smart enough to fool your crew
into taking you off-line.

36:58.549 --> 37:00.039
No need to get personal.

37:03.721 --> 37:04.949
Seven.

37:05.022 --> 37:06.353
l'm here.

37:09.126 --> 37:11.686
Are we still inside the monster?

37:11.762 --> 37:14.560
Yes, but we are going
to find a way out.

37:14.632 --> 37:16.463
There!
This is it!

37:16.567 --> 37:18.262
Exactly what we need.

37:21.038 --> 37:24.337
These class-9 torpedoes
in your weapons manifest.

37:24.408 --> 37:26.069
lf we can bring
your vessel deeper

37:26.143 --> 37:28.839
into the creature's
digestive tract

37:28.913 --> 37:31.040
and detonate one
of these charges,

37:31.115 --> 37:32.776
we might be able
to destroy it.

37:32.850 --> 37:36.115
Starfleet's not in the habit
of killing life-forms.

37:36.187 --> 37:38.815
Even if that life-form
is about to kill you?

37:38.889 --> 37:40.413
lf l could take a few hours

37:40.491 --> 37:42.891
to examine the creature
more thoroughly...

37:43.027 --> 37:44.358
There is no time.

37:44.428 --> 37:45.622
We kill him!

37:47.732 --> 37:49.893
Maybe there's another way.

37:50.001 --> 37:52.128
Explain.

37:52.236 --> 37:54.898
Any living organism,
no matter how large,

37:55.072 --> 37:57.540
will attempt to expel
a foreign body.

37:57.642 --> 38:00.975
lf we could just make
Voyager a little less tasty...

38:01.045 --> 38:03.809
My scans indicate that your
weapons are tetryon-based.

38:03.881 --> 38:06.372
lf you were to fire one
at a pocket of antimatter

38:06.450 --> 38:08.680
released from our warp core,
it would produce

38:08.753 --> 38:10.277
an electrolytic reaction.

38:10.354 --> 38:12.413
Would that
make Voyager taste bad?

38:13.491 --> 38:16.756
lt might at that.

38:20.564 --> 38:22.429
Once l've beamed you
back to your ship,

38:22.500 --> 38:24.832
try adjusting your shields
to this frequency.

38:24.935 --> 38:28.336
You'll find them more resistant
to the bioplasmic discharges.

38:28.406 --> 38:30.499
You seem to know
a little about everything--

38:30.608 --> 38:34.044
medicine, exobiology,
shield harmonics.

38:34.111 --> 38:36.204
l'm something
of a renaissance EMH.

38:36.280 --> 38:38.077
l could use a crewmate like you.

38:38.149 --> 38:40.140
The beast would have
a difficult time

38:40.217 --> 38:43.084
manipulating
a hologram's desires.

38:43.154 --> 38:45.645
An lshmael to your Ahab?

38:45.723 --> 38:47.190
No, thank you.

38:47.258 --> 38:49.852
You're turning down
the hunt of a lifetime.

38:49.927 --> 38:52.054
As appealing as that sounds,

38:52.129 --> 38:54.757
l'm a doctor,
not a dragon slayer.

38:54.832 --> 38:57.392
My program requires
that l do no harm.

38:57.501 --> 38:59.332
Shame.

39:16.187 --> 39:17.984
Qatai's vessel is ready.

39:18.055 --> 39:20.387
l've rerouted Bridge controls
to Engineering--

39:20.458 --> 39:23.120
ops, tactical, helm--
all integrated into one station.

39:23.194 --> 39:24.161
Efficient.

39:24.228 --> 39:25.525
l thought you'd like it.

39:25.596 --> 39:26.790
l'm plotting a course

39:26.864 --> 39:29.128
for the organism's
esophageal aperture.

39:29.200 --> 39:33.000
Prepare to release
the antimatter.

39:40.111 --> 39:42.875
Hull integrity's dropped
another 13 percent.

39:42.980 --> 39:44.242
Doctor.

39:44.315 --> 39:46.112
Ready on my end.

39:46.183 --> 39:48.048
Voyager to Qatai.
Prepare to fire.

39:52.957 --> 39:54.515
Wait! Wait!

39:55.793 --> 39:58.318
No, no. No, no, no.

39:58.396 --> 39:59.795
What's wrong?

39:59.864 --> 40:01.422
That last jolt

40:01.499 --> 40:05.560
must have destabilized
my targeting sensors.

40:05.669 --> 40:08.729
l could establish an interface
to Voyager's targeting array.

40:08.839 --> 40:10.898
Don't bother.
l know my ship.

40:11.008 --> 40:12.635
lt's just being stubborn.

40:15.413 --> 40:17.005
Ah!

40:21.318 --> 40:22.649
Ready.

40:22.753 --> 40:25.950
lnitiate the burst on my mark.

40:26.090 --> 40:27.114
Now.

40:37.768 --> 40:40.896
Like the taste of that?

40:41.005 --> 40:42.632
l'm reading violent contractions

40:42.740 --> 40:45.402
throughout
the digestive chamber.

40:45.476 --> 40:46.841
lt's working.

40:46.911 --> 40:49.573
We're moving back through
the esophageal aperture.

40:53.017 --> 40:55.485
Voyager has been expelled.

40:55.553 --> 40:58.215
We're 3.9 kilometers
from the organism.

40:58.289 --> 40:59.620
After just one burst?

40:59.690 --> 41:01.214
For a big fellow,

41:01.325 --> 41:03.919
he certainly has a low tolerance
for tummy ache.

41:04.028 --> 41:05.893
Qatai's vessel was
also released.

41:05.963 --> 41:07.396
Hail him.

41:12.436 --> 41:15.337
Why haven't you ejected
a second burst?!

41:15.406 --> 41:17.203
We've cleared the organism.

41:17.274 --> 41:18.764
You've been deceived!

41:18.876 --> 41:20.901
We're both still inside it!

41:22.980 --> 41:23.912
He's right.

41:23.981 --> 41:25.608
l'm reading bioplasmic energy.

41:25.683 --> 41:29.050
l am impervious
to the creature's influence.

41:29.119 --> 41:30.177
You were impervious

41:30.254 --> 41:31.915
when it was creating
the illusion

41:31.989 --> 41:33.217
of Voyager getting home

41:33.290 --> 41:35.588
because you didn't
share that desire,

41:35.659 --> 41:38.560
but now we're trying to escape,
which is what you want.

41:38.629 --> 41:40.256
Think about it!

41:40.331 --> 41:45.359
He's showing you
exactly what you want to see.

41:46.737 --> 41:47.897
Seven!

41:50.841 --> 41:52.809
lnitiate
another antimatter burst.

41:55.513 --> 41:57.105
Now.

41:58.215 --> 41:59.614
Fire.

41:59.683 --> 42:01.241
There.

42:13.430 --> 42:14.590
We're out.

42:14.665 --> 42:15.597
Are we certain?

42:15.666 --> 42:17.896
No sign of bioplasmic energy.

42:18.068 --> 42:19.092
We've escaped.

42:19.203 --> 42:21.364
l'm taking us out of range.

42:21.472 --> 42:22.461
Maximum warp.

42:22.573 --> 42:24.541
l'd better see to the crew.

42:26.343 --> 42:29.335
Well, l'll be on my way.
Thanks for your help.

42:29.413 --> 42:31.404
Your engines have taken
heavy damage.

42:31.482 --> 42:32.847
You require our assistance.

42:32.917 --> 42:33.941
No time.

42:34.051 --> 42:36.212
The beast is
already altering course.

42:36.287 --> 42:38.187
l'll handle the repairs myself.

42:38.255 --> 42:40.951
The procedure would take
several days.

42:41.091 --> 42:43.355
Don't worry about me.

42:43.427 --> 42:46.294
Just get your ship home.

42:46.363 --> 42:50.993
And watch out
for pitcher plants.

42:58.576 --> 43:00.009
Location?

43:00.044 --> 43:02.706
We're still
in the Delta Quadrant.

43:02.746 --> 43:03.838
Scan the wormhole.

43:03.914 --> 43:05.142
Find out what went wrong.

43:07.217 --> 43:09.412
lt's gone.

43:09.486 --> 43:11.420
l can't find it on sensors.

43:11.488 --> 43:13.752
Captain.

43:13.824 --> 43:15.621
Bridge controls
have been routed

43:15.693 --> 43:19.220
to Engineering--
ops, tactical, helm-- all of it.

43:19.296 --> 43:20.661
Bridge to Engineering.

43:20.731 --> 43:21.891
Yes, Captain.

43:21.966 --> 43:24.264
Seven? What's going on?

43:24.368 --> 43:25.995
The Doctor will explain.

43:26.103 --> 43:29.095
l will file a complete report
in the morning

43:29.206 --> 43:30.571
after l have regenerated.

43:31.875 --> 43:36.244
Captain's Log, Stardate 52542.3.

43:36.313 --> 43:38.178
We've deployed
a series of beacons

43:38.248 --> 43:41.046
to warn other vessels
about the bioplasmic creature

43:41.118 --> 43:44.246
and resumed a course for home--
our real home.

43:51.762 --> 43:53.195
Naomi Wildman.

43:53.263 --> 43:54.525
Don't worry.

43:54.598 --> 43:56.532
My presence here is authorized.

43:56.600 --> 43:57.589
By whom?

43:57.701 --> 43:59.134
Mom.

43:59.203 --> 44:01.569
She thinks l need to
learn more about Earth.

44:01.672 --> 44:03.697
l see.

44:03.774 --> 44:05.241
And does studying this image

44:05.342 --> 44:07.503
increase your desire
to go there?

44:07.578 --> 44:09.671
Not really.

44:09.747 --> 44:11.772
l concur.

44:11.849 --> 44:13.680
lt is unremarkable.

44:13.751 --> 44:15.548
But my mom likes it

44:15.619 --> 44:18.383
and even Neelix can't wait
to get there,

44:18.455 --> 44:21.481
so l guess
it can't be that bad.

44:21.558 --> 44:25.289
Given this crew's determination
to return home,

44:25.362 --> 44:28.525
l have no doubt we will
see it for ourselves someday.
