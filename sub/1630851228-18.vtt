A reverse mortgage
on his home, divorce,

12:39.976 --> 12:41.804
custody battle

12:41.848 --> 12:43.153
Bauer's got a lot on the line.

12:43.197 --> 12:44.589
Nice work.
Let's bring him in.

12:44.633 --> 12:46.635
And I have an update
on our French banker.

12:46.678 --> 12:49.420
Background on Joseph Corbin
led us to a dead end.

12:49.464 --> 12:50.813
His passport is fake.

12:50.857 --> 12:53.207
France has no actual record
he exists.

12:53.250 --> 12:54.817
That he was a banker
just came from

12:54.861 --> 12:56.340
what he told other passengers.

12:56.384 --> 12:59.039
Our victim is a John Doe.

12:59.082 --> 13:00.257
All right,
let's widen the net

13:00.301 --> 13:01.519
to other European countries.

13:01.563 --> 13:02.869
See if somebody's government
can ID him.

He's an old friend.

The UNODC monitors activity

for traffickers
to operate across borders.

15:00.160 --> 15:02.814
May I?
- Yeah. Come on.

15:08.298 --> 15:11.388
Ah, Balkan cartel.

15:11.432 --> 15:14.130
This stretch of the Danube
is considered their territory.

15:16.132 --> 15:17.481
All right,
so the Balkan cartel

15:17.525 --> 15:20.136
is smuggling their drugs
onboard a tourist ship.

15:20.180 --> 15:22.486
Third party robbery crew
finds out about the stash,

15:22.530 --> 15:24.662
they roll up on the ship
before it docks

15:24.706 --> 15:26.055
to rip off the cartel.

15:26.099 --> 15:27.491
They just didn't know
where the drugs were hidden.

15:27.535 --> 15:29.276
They tossed the lockers.
Not there.

15:29.319 --> 15:30.712
Then they storm the lounge

15:30.755 --> 15:32.975
looking for someone
to tell them the hiding place.

15:33.019 --> 15:35.325
What kind of guys think
they can hit the cartel

15:35.369 --> 15:36.979
and get away with it?

15:37.023 --> 15:38.502
Territorially speaking,

15:38.546 --> 15:40.461
the Balkans have
plenty of enemies,

15:40.504 --> 15:43.159
rival organization,
Italians, Dutch.

15:43.203 --> 15:45.205
Anja's parents said
the gunmen spoke German.

15:45.248 --> 15:47.685
What if it's a local gang?
Small operation.

15:47.729 --> 15:49.426
Looks like Raines
might've uncovered

15:49.470 --> 15:51.428
why our good Samaritan
got in the way.

15:51.472 --> 15:54.475
Real name: Marko Horvat
from Croatia, not France,

15:54.518 --> 15:56.781
working for the cartel
to supervise the shipment

15:56.825 --> 15:59.175
posing as a guest.
- There you go.

15:59.219 --> 16:02.352
lives, he was protecting the
He wasn't trying to save drugs.

16:02.396 --> 16:03.614
The cartel
would not forgive him

16:03.658 --> 16:05.355
if he went down
without a fight.

16:05.399 --> 16:07.967
That's one mystery down.
Here's another.

16:08.010 --> 16:10.839
Like Kellett said,
who were they trying to find

16:10.882 --> 16:12.972
to tell them the location
of these drugs.

16:13.015 --> 16:14.190
The captain?

16:14.234 --> 16:15.844
He's in charge
of day to day operation,

16:15.887 --> 16:18.760
and he's strapped for cash.
Might be getting a cut.

16:18.803 --> 16:20.196
Yeah, but they had him.

16:20.240 --> 16:21.893
They smashed him in the face,
and they let him go.

16:21.937 --> 16:24.461
Well, whoever is involved
must be sweating now.

16:24.505 --> 16:26.986
The Balkan cartel will not
be happy about this seizure.

16:27.029 --> 16:28.204
Who said seizure?

16:30.728 --> 16:32.730
For now, we keep
this discovery under wraps.

16:32.774 --> 16:35.516
It stays off channel
as if it never happened.

16:35.559 --> 16:36.952
As far as the cartel
are concerned,

16:36.996 --> 16:38.084
the local police are clueless

16:38.127 --> 16:39.563
about a drug smuggling
angle here.

16:39.607 --> 16:41.913
We don't want to scare away
any big fish.

16:44.177 --> 16:46.396
<i>- Wunderbar.</i>
- All right.

16:48.094 --> 16:52.054
Hey, there's a member of the
ship's crew worth another look.

16:52.098 --> 16:53.621
Sebastian Klein.

16:53.664 --> 16:55.405
He wasn't in the lounge
during the attack,

16:55.449 --> 16:57.581
but his job,
kitchen inventory.

16:57.625 --> 16:59.148
He's had the position
for six months

16:59.192 --> 17:00.149
and it's the only place
on board

17:00.193 --> 17:01.585
where he'd be unsupervised.

17:01.629 --> 17:03.022
Local police
instructed the crew

17:03.065 --> 17:05.372
to stay onboard until
they finished questioning,

17:05.415 --> 17:07.896
but when they called
Sebastian's name, he's gone.

17:07.939 --> 17:10.029
Not in his cabin,
not in the holding pen,

17:10.072 --> 17:12.074
disappeared.
- Hmm.

17:12.118 --> 17:14.598
Illegal gambling,
possession, theft.

17:14.642 --> 17:17.123
No way a guy with his record
gets hired on a luxury cruise.

17:17.166 --> 17:18.646
He's a liability.

17:18.689 --> 17:20.952
Except Valhalla was skimping
on background checks.

17:20.996 --> 17:22.519
Yeah, still, the captain
would have to sign off

17:22.563 --> 17:24.739
on a red flag like him.
- Yeah.

17:24.782 --> 17:28.264
But what if there's a reason
the captain is colorblind?

17:28.308 --> 17:29.874
They're brothers.

safest job on board.

I mean, it's hard to screw up
inventory, even for Sebastian.

18:33.416 --> 18:35.157
Well, he found a way,
didn't he?

18:35.201 --> 18:36.289
What?

18:36.332 --> 18:37.507
The gunmen were
never targeting

18:37.551 --> 18:38.682
the passengers in the lounge.

18:38.726 --> 18:40.162
They were looking
for your brother.

18:40.206 --> 18:41.598
Why?

We found 20 kilos of heroin
aboard your ship

18:43.731 --> 18:46.168
under Sebastian's watch.
Now, a ship carrying

18:46.212 --> 18:48.039
that kind of weight
is an easy target to attack,

18:48.083 --> 18:49.693
and I couldn't help but notice

18:49.737 --> 18:52.522
that you have incentive
to carry that product.

18:52.566 --> 18:55.917
Your ex-wife bleeding you dry.

18:55.960 --> 18:58.267
My personal problems

We'll sort it out
like we always do

19:00.661 --> 19:03.229

but doing something like this

19:03.272 --> 19:05.187
<i>would jeopardize everything.</i>

19:05.231 --> 19:07.015
My children
mean the world to me.

Sebastian has been
in the wind since the shooting.

If you know his whereabouts,

19:13.326 --> 19:15.066
now would be a good time
to speak up.

I have no idea, I swear.
Check my phone records.

19:19.375 --> 19:21.247
I've tried to reach him.
He won't pick up.

19:26.165 --> 19:28.993
All right.

19:29.037 --> 19:30.865
Settle in.

19:30.908 --> 19:32.519
I'll let you know
if we have any more questions.

19:39.613 --> 19:41.745
- Scott.
- Yeah.

19:41.789 --> 19:43.051
A thought crossed my mind.

19:43.094 --> 19:45.271
Sebastian might've contacted
different cities

19:45.314 --> 19:46.924
to help him traffic
along the river.

19:46.968 --> 19:49.318
Someone who not only speaks
the local language,

19:49.362 --> 19:51.015
but knows the ins and outs
of the city.

19:51.059 --> 19:52.669
And which wheels
get the grease.

19:52.713 --> 19:54.932
A third party company
provides additional crew

19:54.976 --> 19:56.760
for the vessel at a port--
it lets Valhalla

19:56.804 --> 20:00.242
contract out locally
without calling them employees.

20:00.286 --> 20:02.679
The ship was in Budapest
one day before the attack.

20:02.723 --> 20:05.943
And somebody
from this company boarded it.

20:05.987 --> 20:08.337
It's possible Sebastian
had an accomplice.

20:08.381 --> 20:10.731
Somebody not listed
on the manifest.

20:10.774 --> 20:13.603
Well, the ship's gotta have
a log of who set foot on board.

20:13.647 --> 20:15.910
I need a name.
- Okay.

20:17.520 --> 20:18.608
All right,
so I did some digging

20:18.652 --> 20:20.262
on Sebastian's
gambling habits.

20:20.306 --> 20:21.829
Turns out he has a reward card

20:21.872 --> 20:24.266
at the local casino,
the Riviera.

20:24.310 --> 20:26.268
UNODC has that place branded

20:26.312 --> 20:27.965
as a front
for the Balkan cartel.

20:28.009 --> 20:29.706
That's how he got mixed up
with the traffickers.

20:29.750 --> 20:31.708
The way the Danube
cuts through Europe,

20:31.752 --> 20:34.145
the cartel had a built-in
pipeline with the ship.

20:34.189 --> 20:36.452
Sebastian had free rein
to make his drops.

20:36.496 --> 20:37.975
It still doesn't answer
who came on board

20:38.019 --> 20:39.847
and shot up the ship.
- No, but it suggests

20:39.890 --> 20:41.631
that when the gunmen
couldn't find the drugs,

20:41.675 --> 20:44.025
they went looking for
the next best thing, Sebastian.

20:44.068 --> 20:47.507
Mm-hmm, he's our guy,
and my gut tells me

20:47.550 --> 20:49.160
he's our missing link
to the shooters.

20:49.204 --> 20:50.466
I got an address.

20:52.729 --> 20:54.862
- Door!
- On it.

20:57.778 --> 20:58.648
Clear.

20:58.692 --> 21:00.737
- Clear.
- Clear.

21:00.781 --> 21:02.739
I want a full sweep--
any clues to where

21:02.783 --> 21:04.567
Sebastian has been,
who he's talked to,

21:04.611 --> 21:05.960
or where he is going.
Understood?

21:06.003 --> 21:07.962
If he's being hunted
by the cartel,

21:08.005 --> 21:10.878
the cops, and the robbery
crew, this place is compromised.

21:10.921 --> 21:12.140
He's not dumb enough
to come back.

21:12.183 --> 21:13.359
Well, he was dumb enough

21:13.402 --> 21:14.969
to put his address
on a rewards card, so.

21:15.012 --> 21:17.319
Oh, old school
motorcycle GPS.

21:17.363 --> 21:19.843
These devices keep a history
of where the bike's travelled.

21:19.887 --> 21:21.062
Fire it up.

21:21.105 --> 21:23.325
I guess we can
also consider him armed.

21:23.369 --> 21:25.588
Great.

21:25.632 --> 21:27.198
Keep Bauer on ice
at the station.

21:27.242 --> 21:29.288
We cannot afford to have
both brothers off the grid.

21:29.331 --> 21:31.072
Oh, here we go.

21:31.115 --> 21:33.727
There's a frequently visited
address that keeps popping up.

21:33.770 --> 21:35.337
Sebastian has been there
multiple times

21:35.381 --> 21:38.471
in the last few months,
including a week ago.

21:38.514 --> 21:41.343
It's a pub in District 12.
Jaeger and I can scope it out.

21:41.387 --> 21:43.171
- Go for it.
- Okay.

21:44.651 --> 21:45.869
Oh, I just got the name
from the ship's records.

in Budapest

and stayed off the manifest.
I'll send it to your phone.

21:49.003 --> 21:51.614
Great.
Run down if Sebastian

21:51.658 --> 21:53.094
has made any legal
firearms purchases.

21:53.137 --> 21:54.617
And now that we know
what we're up against,

21:54.661 --> 21:56.532
it'd be a good idea
to a sweep of the ship again.

21:56.576 --> 21:59.405
See if we missed anything
in Sebastian's quarters.

Sebastian was
never threatening your life.

That "why" is the sound

by his own flesh and blood.

35:33.435 --> 35:35.350

for the cartel.

you're drowning in debt.

Valhalla would never
find out about it.

you and your ship

you chose your apartment.

stand for an obstructed view.
