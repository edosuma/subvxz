WEBVTT

00:12.637 --> 00:14.764
[fire crackling]

00:14.848 --> 00:18.810
[pensive instrumental music playing]

00:32.741 --> 00:33.616
[gasps] Oh!

00:33.700 --> 00:36.286
-Jesus! Mamma mia, Mae! Jeez!
-Hey. Sorry.

00:36.953 --> 00:37.829
[sighs]

00:37.912 --> 00:39.622
-Marshmallow?
-Uh… No, I'm good.

00:40.707 --> 00:42.292
-Rubber band?
-Sure, I'll take one.

00:42.375 --> 00:43.793
-All right.
-Thanks.

00:47.464 --> 00:50.008
[laughing] Oh!

00:50.091 --> 00:52.010
Story time.

00:52.093 --> 00:54.012
-Nice. Well, I'll settle in.
-Okay.

00:54.596 --> 00:55.513
Um…

01:02.437 --> 01:03.271
[sighs]

01:03.772 --> 01:05.440
Mae, I just got mine replaced.

01:09.235 --> 01:10.236
[kisses]

01:10.320 --> 01:11.279
[kisses]

01:13.281 --> 01:15.658
Hope you backed up the pictures
from your wedding.

01:16.242 --> 01:17.327
[sighs]

01:17.410 --> 01:19.454
-Um, can you introduce me?
-Okay. [clears throat]

01:19.537 --> 01:22.332
-Can you do the "And now" one?
-The "And now"? Okay, got it.

01:22.415 --> 01:23.541
Thank you.

01:24.334 --> 01:29.214
And now, please put your hands together,

01:30.048 --> 01:32.342
and welcome to the stage,

01:32.425 --> 01:35.178
the one, the only,

01:35.261 --> 01:38.890
Mae Martin!

01:38.973 --> 01:41.976
[crowd cheering]

01:48.691 --> 01:49.526
Hi!

01:49.609 --> 01:51.361
[crowd continues cheering]

01:53.488 --> 01:54.614
How we doing?

01:59.661 --> 02:00.912
[chuckling] Hey.

02:02.789 --> 02:03.748
Hi.

02:05.500 --> 02:06.876
Nice to see you.

02:08.461 --> 02:11.214
Oh my God. This is the best.

02:11.297 --> 02:13.716
Thank you so much for being here.

02:13.800 --> 02:16.177
What's… Uh… Okay. [laughs]

02:16.761 --> 02:19.347
I have so much to tell you, genuinely. Um…

02:19.430 --> 02:22.350
What is everybody's name?
Should we just start…

02:22.433 --> 02:25.186
On the count of three,
everybody say your name.

02:25.270 --> 02:26.437
Ready? One, two, three.

02:26.521 --> 02:28.231
[crowd yelling names indistinctly]

02:28.314 --> 02:31.276
Hello, uh, I'm Mae.

02:31.818 --> 02:33.653
I'm so pumped to be in Canada right now.

02:33.736 --> 02:35.864
-Just, I really…
-[crowd cheering]

02:37.574 --> 02:39.868
Um, I… I am Canadian.

02:39.951 --> 02:41.578
-I'm very Canadian.
-[scattered whoops]

02:41.661 --> 02:45.290
But, please, I've been living
in England for the past 12 years.

02:45.373 --> 02:49.294
I've been living in London.
So I do sound a bit like an asshole.

02:49.377 --> 02:51.296
I do have a slight,

02:51.921 --> 02:53.214
like, Madonna lilt.

02:53.298 --> 02:57.093
And I'm trying so hard to fight it.
I'm really sorry. But it's…

02:57.177 --> 03:00.471
My dad's British. Like very…
He's very, very British.

03:00.555 --> 03:04.767
He's like… My dad's like
a mystical British gentleman.

03:04.851 --> 03:07.228
He's very… He's a magical man.

03:07.312 --> 03:09.480
He's very into, like,
the phases of the moon.

03:09.564 --> 03:12.275
He's… He's a moon man.
He's into, like, um…

03:12.358 --> 03:14.944
He knows all the birds
that ever visit his garden

03:15.028 --> 03:18.740
and he has
a specific relationship with each bird.

03:19.532 --> 03:23.286
And my childhood, like my whole childhood,
was pretty mystical.

03:23.369 --> 03:25.663
Like, the best example I can think of…

03:25.747 --> 03:27.916
Okay, when I was about eight years old,

03:27.999 --> 03:31.127
my dad was driving
my brother and I to karate class.

03:31.211 --> 03:33.004
And it was a very Canadian scene.

03:33.087 --> 03:36.591
It's like 5:00 p.m.,
the sun's already going down.

03:36.674 --> 03:40.011
It's snowing, we're on the highway.
We're going to the karate dojo.

03:40.094 --> 03:43.348
Me and my brother in the backseat.
I'm eight, my brother's 12.

03:43.431 --> 03:46.684
I was a green belt in karate,
my brother was a yellow belt.

03:47.393 --> 03:50.188
So he was four years older,
two belts lower.

03:50.271 --> 03:51.147
Um…

03:52.190 --> 03:55.735
Which is not important,
but I thought I would flag it.

03:57.070 --> 03:59.656
And, uh, we're driving along the highway

03:59.739 --> 04:03.243
and suddenly my dad, like,
swerves to the side of the highway

04:03.326 --> 04:04.869
in, like, a panicked move.

04:04.953 --> 04:08.164
And tires are screeching,
people are honking. Really dangerous.

04:08.248 --> 04:10.458
He pulls over,
and he's really shaken up, and he goes,

04:10.541 --> 04:14.045
[British accent] "I'm so sorry, children,
but we have to get out of the car."

04:14.128 --> 04:16.923
[regular accent] We're like, "What?"
And so we get out of the car.

04:17.006 --> 04:19.467
We're standing by the side
of the highway, in the snow.

04:19.550 --> 04:23.429
My brother, 12 years old, so embarrassed,
he's like, in his karate uniform.

04:23.513 --> 04:26.891
And people are driving by, they're like,
"Is he a yellow belt? 'Cause…"

04:27.976 --> 04:30.728
"Hang on a second. He looks older…"

04:32.230 --> 04:34.732
"We're gonna turn the car around.
Check this out."

04:34.816 --> 04:37.318
And so we're like, "What is going on?"
And my dad goes,

04:37.402 --> 04:40.363
"I've just seen
the new moon through glass."

04:41.406 --> 04:45.910
So, he had seen the sliver of the new moon
through the windshield

04:45.994 --> 04:48.037
and we had to pull over,
get out of the car,

04:48.121 --> 04:50.581
and he made us bow
to the moon three times.

04:50.665 --> 04:53.126
We had to do this whole ritual.

04:53.209 --> 04:55.920
We had to say,
"Good evening, Lady Moon." It was…

04:57.088 --> 05:00.425
It was mystical. He's a moon man.
He's deep into the moon.

05:00.508 --> 05:05.096
And, um, I was just visiting recently,
uh, visiting home.

05:05.179 --> 05:07.598
This is my childhood home
that I grew up in,

05:07.682 --> 05:10.685
and they've had it
since long before I was born.

05:10.768 --> 05:12.395
And I'm in the kitchen
with my mom and dad,

05:12.478 --> 05:16.399
and my dad comes up to me
and goes, "Meet me in the study at dusk."

05:17.150 --> 05:18.276
I'm like, "But I…"

05:18.359 --> 05:20.486
I go to my mom,
I'm like, "What time is dusk?"

05:20.570 --> 05:23.406
She's like, "I don't know." [laughs]

05:23.489 --> 05:25.908
And I go up to the study, which is like…

05:25.992 --> 05:29.245
It's been many things over the years,
it's been like a spare room or whatever.

05:29.329 --> 05:31.998
My dad's there with a glass of wine,
looking out the window.

05:32.081 --> 05:35.251
He wanted to show me
there's a family of raccoons

05:35.335 --> 05:38.421
that lives in a tree
in the neighbor's yard.

05:38.504 --> 05:40.465
And, like, every night
at dusk, they emerge,

05:40.548 --> 05:43.593
and he's got, yeah,
a relationship with them all. Um…

05:44.469 --> 05:46.637
So, we're standing,
waiting for the raccoons,

05:47.180 --> 05:50.183
and he just really dreamily goes, um…

05:50.266 --> 05:53.019
"Do you know
you were conceived in this room?"

05:53.895 --> 05:54.896
Which…

05:56.898 --> 05:58.149
So I was like, "Oh…"

05:58.232 --> 06:02.403
And I don't like to shut him down
when he's being vulnerable, so…

06:03.154 --> 06:08.242
I was like, "Wait. You remember
the specific night that I was conceived?"

06:08.326 --> 06:11.204
And he said this phrase,
which truly has haunted me

06:12.288 --> 06:13.873
ever since. He said,

06:13.956 --> 06:16.292
he goes, "Yes, of course I remember it."

06:16.376 --> 06:17.585
"I remember it well."

06:19.253 --> 06:20.463
This is what he said.

06:20.546 --> 06:23.383
"The moonlight shone in
over your mother's bottom."

06:23.466 --> 06:24.884
[crowd gasps, laughs]

06:33.559 --> 06:35.436
Over your…

06:35.520 --> 06:37.688
I feel like
you're not fully getting, like…

06:39.565 --> 06:42.777
I now know the position
I was conceived in.

06:43.319 --> 06:45.363
I'm horrified.

06:47.323 --> 06:50.701
Nobody wants to be conceived doggy style.

06:50.785 --> 06:52.995
It's so bleak.

06:54.288 --> 06:57.125
You don't want…
You want to be conceived face to face.

06:57.834 --> 06:59.252
Eye contact.

06:59.335 --> 07:02.088
At the moment of ejaculation,
just like we…

07:02.630 --> 07:04.090
"We're making a choice

07:04.715 --> 07:05.925
to make a life."

07:07.301 --> 07:09.720
Not like, "Ah! Bite the pillow!"
It's horrible.

07:12.098 --> 07:13.724
It's… It's bleak. It's like…

07:14.225 --> 07:16.352
It's changed how I see myself.

07:16.436 --> 07:17.395
Like, how I…

07:18.646 --> 07:20.565
I'm like, "I'm a doggy-style baby."

07:20.648 --> 07:22.150
[crowd laughing]

07:22.233 --> 07:23.901
Makes a lot of sense, actually.

07:24.652 --> 07:25.736
Explains a lot.

07:26.237 --> 07:29.031
It's, like, affected my posture.
I'm just a little more… I'm like…

07:29.532 --> 07:30.867
Just a little hunched.

07:30.950 --> 07:31.826
[laughs]

07:33.161 --> 07:36.622
I feel like I can spot
other doggy-style babies

07:36.706 --> 07:40.168
when I'm out in the world, 100%, there's…

07:40.668 --> 07:42.712
I'll be getting on the subway,
and there's someone…

07:42.795 --> 07:44.672
[grunting]

07:44.755 --> 07:46.757
Smoking on the subway.
I'm like, "Oh, yeah."

07:48.801 --> 07:50.678
Or I'll be in a bar,
and the bartender's like,

07:50.761 --> 07:54.056
"Sorry, someone's just sent you a drink."
I look down the bar, and… [grunting]

07:54.849 --> 07:56.267
Another doggy-style baby.

07:56.350 --> 07:59.395
There's some in here tonight.
I can see us. Several.

08:00.021 --> 08:01.314
[Mae laughs]

08:03.357 --> 08:04.192
They…

08:04.275 --> 08:07.111
Every time I go home to visit,
something like this happens.

08:07.195 --> 08:10.531
Something that derails my…
my grasp on reality.

08:10.615 --> 08:14.118
Like, um, okay,
my parents have this anecdote,

08:14.202 --> 08:16.412
and it's a story
they've been telling my whole life.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.664
Like, once a year,
they'll have a few drinks

08:18.748 --> 08:21.000
and tell this story
at a dinner party or whatever.

08:21.083 --> 08:24.045
Um… And it makes me feel crazy,

08:24.128 --> 08:26.714
because I'm like, "It cannot be true."

08:26.797 --> 08:29.717
So, why are you
doing this to me? What is this?

08:29.800 --> 08:32.011
Um, and my brother and I get really upset.

08:32.094 --> 08:34.514
I'll tell you the story
and then you can be the judge,

08:34.597 --> 08:36.224
if you think it's true or not. Okay?

08:36.307 --> 08:38.059
-[audience whoops]
-Okay.

08:38.142 --> 08:40.853
So, my parents swear

08:41.395 --> 08:43.356
that when they were
in their late twenties,

08:43.439 --> 08:45.650
they were driving
through Northern Ontario,

08:45.733 --> 08:48.110
down a winding road through a forest,

08:48.194 --> 08:51.697
and they drove under a moose.

08:52.490 --> 08:54.492
[crowd laughing]

08:56.035 --> 08:56.953
[scoffs]

08:57.745 --> 08:58.955
They swear.

09:00.081 --> 09:01.040
They swear.

09:02.708 --> 09:05.878
My mom says they were driving
down this winding road,

09:05.962 --> 09:07.880
the moose was horizontal on the road,

09:07.964 --> 09:10.049
and they drove under its belly.

09:11.175 --> 09:12.760
It makes me feel insane.

09:12.843 --> 09:14.929
I'm like, "What are you talking about?"

09:15.471 --> 09:18.140
It's… And so it's… [laughs]

09:18.224 --> 09:19.725
She does a sound effect

09:19.809 --> 09:22.645
of the sound of the belly fur of the moose

09:22.728 --> 09:24.647
gently grazing the roof of the car.

09:24.730 --> 09:26.649
Just like… [whooshes softly]

09:26.732 --> 09:28.025
Can you imagine?

09:28.776 --> 09:32.071
It makes me feel insane.
It makes me feel crazy.

09:32.572 --> 09:36.033
And, uh, it makes
my brother irate, as well. Because…

09:36.117 --> 09:37.577
So, the last time I was visiting,

09:37.660 --> 09:40.246
me and my brother were like,
"We need to get to the bottom of this."

09:40.329 --> 09:42.707
We need to find out
if this is even possible.

09:42.790 --> 09:44.250
So we did research

09:44.333 --> 09:47.169
and we found out
the height of a Toyota Tercel.

09:47.253 --> 09:49.130
That's the car they were driving.

09:49.213 --> 09:51.173
So, the height of the roof of the car.

09:51.257 --> 09:54.010
We Googled the largest
ever recorded moose.

09:56.554 --> 09:58.723
And the infuriating thing is

09:59.807 --> 10:02.643
it could <i>just</i> have happened.

10:07.815 --> 10:10.484
It could <i>just</i> have happened.

10:11.193 --> 10:15.031
If they happened to stumble upon
the biggest-ever recorded moose,

10:15.656 --> 10:17.408
I guess it's possible.

10:17.491 --> 10:18.826
It makes me feel insane.

10:20.828 --> 10:23.331
[sighs] You think it's true?
Give a cheer if you think it's true.

10:23.414 --> 10:25.666
[crowd cheering]

10:25.750 --> 10:26.751
Really?

10:27.293 --> 10:29.170
Give a cheer if you think it's bullshit.

10:29.253 --> 10:31.213
-[loud cheering]
-See?

10:31.922 --> 10:32.965
I don't know.

10:33.049 --> 10:35.509
I think it says a lot
about your worldview.

10:35.593 --> 10:40.348
Like, if you believe in the moose,
you're young at heart. You…

10:41.057 --> 10:45.353
You've retained a sliver of,
like, childlike enthusiasm

10:45.853 --> 10:46.729
about life.

10:46.812 --> 10:48.981
And if you don't believe
in the moose, you're…

10:49.065 --> 10:50.900
Look, it's been a tough couple years.

10:52.193 --> 10:54.945
It's been tough, hasn't it? Oh my God.

10:55.488 --> 10:58.407
It really has. We got to do
whatever it takes to get by.

10:58.491 --> 11:00.534
You know? Whatever makes you feel good.

11:00.618 --> 11:04.830
Like… So my father
sent me a news article recently.

11:04.914 --> 11:08.042
Uh, he sent me this news article,
and was like, "I thought you'd like this."

11:08.125 --> 11:10.878
"I thought you'd relate to it."
Those are the words he used.

11:10.961 --> 11:12.630
"I thought you'd really relate to this."

11:12.713 --> 11:15.508
This was the story,
and I haven't stopped thinking about it.

11:15.591 --> 11:19.053
I'm going to tell it to you.
So this, it happened in the Netherlands,

11:19.136 --> 11:21.263
in a small town in the Netherlands,

11:21.347 --> 11:25.935
where basically this family noticed
that they weren't getting any mail.

11:26.018 --> 11:28.896
They were like, "We haven't received
any mail in a long time."

11:28.979 --> 11:30.648
Weeks start going by.

11:30.731 --> 11:33.067
They're like,
"Wait. We're not even getting our bills

11:33.150 --> 11:35.653
or pamphlets in the mail.
This is really weird."

11:35.736 --> 11:38.739
So they go to their neighbors.
"Are you guys getting your mail?"

11:38.823 --> 11:41.826
They're like, "No.
This is so weird. Not for so long."

11:41.909 --> 11:45.996
So they go to the post office
and speak to, like, the boss.

11:46.080 --> 11:47.748
The mail boss, you know. [chuckling]

11:48.249 --> 11:49.709
You know, the mail boss…

11:50.543 --> 11:52.253
that you have to defeat

11:53.838 --> 11:56.048
to pass Level 10. [laughs]

11:56.549 --> 11:58.300
He's like… [growls] And, um…

11:59.135 --> 12:01.470
They're like,
"We're not getting any of our mail."

12:01.554 --> 12:03.222
He's like, "I'll look into it."

12:03.305 --> 12:06.517
He goes to speak to the mailman
who's responsible for that block.

12:06.600 --> 12:10.229
And I can't remember the mailman's name,
so we'll call him like… Gary.

12:10.312 --> 12:11.647
We'll call him Gary.

12:11.731 --> 12:15.651
He's like, "Gary, these people are saying
that they're not getting their mail."

12:15.735 --> 12:16.902
"What's going on?"

12:16.986 --> 12:19.488
And Gary's like
weirdly defensive right away.

12:19.572 --> 12:22.533
He's like, "I don't know what to tell you.
I deliver the mail."

12:22.616 --> 12:25.536
"If they're not getting mail,
it means no one's writing to them."

12:25.619 --> 12:27.079
They're like, "Okay."

12:27.663 --> 12:29.623
So the mail boss is like, "Okay, Gary."

12:29.707 --> 12:33.335
But privately, to his coworkers,
he's like, "What's up with Gary?"

12:33.419 --> 12:34.920
Gary is being really weird.

12:35.004 --> 12:37.298
So they decide
they're going to keep an eye on Gary

12:37.381 --> 12:38.924
and investigate the sitch.

12:39.008 --> 12:40.468
And so, the next day,

12:40.551 --> 12:43.429
Gary comes to work and first red flag,

12:43.512 --> 12:46.056
he picks up the mail
and gets in his personal vehicle.

12:46.140 --> 12:47.892
Not the mail truck or whatever.

12:47.975 --> 12:50.311
Gets in his… And he drives out of town.

12:51.562 --> 12:54.190
So they're like, "Fuck."
And they followed him.

12:54.690 --> 12:56.025
They follow him,

12:56.108 --> 12:58.652
and he drives into the forest
in the Netherlands.

12:58.736 --> 13:00.863
And they follow him at a distance.

13:00.946 --> 13:03.908
They watch him park. They park.
They're keeping an eye on him.

13:03.991 --> 13:05.576
They see him get out of the car.

13:05.659 --> 13:09.288
He takes the bag of mail, he goes
into the woods, he's gone 45 minutes.

13:09.371 --> 13:11.290
He comes back out with no bag.

13:12.124 --> 13:13.918
Gets in his car, drives away.

13:14.001 --> 13:17.254
So they go in after him.
Into the forest. And…

13:17.755 --> 13:20.716
Imagine this. This is the sight
they're confronted with, okay?

13:20.800 --> 13:23.761
Beautiful, dappled sunlight, you know.

13:23.844 --> 13:25.554
Mist rising from the moss.

13:25.638 --> 13:29.558
There's a lone moose.
A huge moose in the background.

13:29.642 --> 13:31.727
Just towering over the trees, truly.

13:32.228 --> 13:33.521
Um… [laughs]

13:33.604 --> 13:36.232
And they see, as far as the eye can see,

13:36.315 --> 13:39.443
there are hundreds of piles
of freshly turned earth.

13:39.527 --> 13:42.530
Little-- In neat rows
stretching through the forest.

13:42.613 --> 13:44.907
And they dust, they brush the dirt up.

13:44.990 --> 13:47.076
Gary's been burying the mail.

13:48.702 --> 13:50.246
He's been burying the mail for ages.

13:50.329 --> 13:54.083
This has obviously been going on
a long time and it's now amped up.

13:54.166 --> 13:55.668
They're like, "Fuck." And, uh…

13:56.168 --> 13:58.587
They approach him the next day at work.

13:58.671 --> 13:59.672
Gently.

13:59.755 --> 14:02.091
They approach him gently.
They're like, "Hey, Gar. Um…"

14:02.174 --> 14:03.676
[clicks tongue] "I…"

14:04.552 --> 14:07.137
"We noticed you've been burying the mail."

14:09.139 --> 14:12.184
"And we were just wondering,
why are you doing that?"

14:12.268 --> 14:16.105
And in the news article, this was
the direct quote from the mailman,

14:16.188 --> 14:18.983
in answer to the question,
"Why are you burying the mail?"

14:19.066 --> 14:21.485
This is what he said. He said,

14:21.569 --> 14:24.321
"I did it once, it felt good."

14:27.408 --> 14:30.578
"And now it's just kind of what I do."

14:32.538 --> 14:34.665
I love him.

14:35.583 --> 14:37.334
He's my hero, I…

14:37.418 --> 14:39.461
Guys, Gary went to jail.

14:39.545 --> 14:42.172
He went to jail for eight months. Yeah.

14:42.256 --> 14:45.259
You can't fuck with the mail,
that's a federal offense. Um…

14:45.342 --> 14:48.512
He went to jail. And I wanted
to write him fan mail in jail,

14:48.596 --> 14:50.222
but I don't want to stress him out.

14:50.306 --> 14:53.183
'Cause he'd be like,
"I want to bury it. Argh!"

14:55.436 --> 14:56.520
[laughs]

14:57.104 --> 14:58.772
But, no, I really was, like…

14:58.856 --> 15:01.442
I've never felt so seen by my father. Um…

15:02.234 --> 15:03.777
That's… [chuckles]

15:04.361 --> 15:07.823
It has been tough.
Like, I'm trying to get back into life

15:07.907 --> 15:11.035
and sort of feel that enthusiasm again
of pre-pandemic life.

15:11.118 --> 15:15.831
Especially, I'm struggling to feel
that enthusiasm in my romantic life.

15:15.915 --> 15:17.791
I don't know
if anyone is in the same boat.

15:17.875 --> 15:21.211
-[scattered cheers]
-But post-pandemic dating, like, I'm…

15:21.295 --> 15:23.964
'Cause I'm 35, like…

15:24.048 --> 15:26.550
In my early 20s, so romantic.

15:26.634 --> 15:28.594
Obsessed with finding "the one."

15:28.677 --> 15:31.972
My parents are very in love
and that was my model. So I just…

15:32.056 --> 15:35.476
Somebody would be, "Do you have the time?"
And I'd be, "I love you as well."

15:36.477 --> 15:37.645
Is that…

15:38.228 --> 15:39.313
"And I…"

15:39.396 --> 15:41.982
"And I want to go with you."
[awkward laugh]

15:42.816 --> 15:43.943
"Where are we going?"

15:44.693 --> 15:48.322
Um, and now
I'm just a bit like… I don't know.

15:48.405 --> 15:49.907
Last summer, I dated someone.

15:49.990 --> 15:52.534
A man, actually,
a lovely man, if you can believe.

15:52.618 --> 15:54.662
Not if you-- Wait, not if you…

15:55.913 --> 15:58.749
Not "if you can believe
that men can be lovely."

15:58.832 --> 16:00.334
Of course they can.

16:00.417 --> 16:01.961
But if you can believe that <i>I…</i>

16:02.044 --> 16:02.920
Um…

16:03.712 --> 16:07.424
Yeah, so we dated for like six months,
me and this guy and, uh…

16:07.508 --> 16:10.719
You know it was really nice,
but I'm 35, he's 36.

16:10.803 --> 16:13.931
Like, at this point,
we both have big exes in our past.

16:14.014 --> 16:17.643
You know what I mean? We're never
going to be that big ex for each other.

16:17.726 --> 16:20.354
Like, we're never
gonna properly traumatize each other,

16:20.437 --> 16:21.855
so it's kind of like…

16:22.356 --> 16:24.066
What's the point? Um…

16:24.149 --> 16:25.401
[audience laughter]

16:25.484 --> 16:26.443
And… [laughs]

16:26.944 --> 16:30.197
So, we were in bed one night,
and we were just chatting,

16:30.280 --> 16:33.701
we were having a nice light-hearted chat.
He wasn't trying to be heavy.

16:33.784 --> 16:37.121
He just goes, "If we had kids one day,
what would we name our kids?"

16:37.204 --> 16:38.664
I was, like, "I don't…"

16:38.747 --> 16:40.708
I was like, "I don't know."

16:40.791 --> 16:44.420
At this point, I've had
that conversation with so many people.

16:44.920 --> 16:46.046
I was like… [sighs]

16:46.130 --> 16:47.381
"I don't know."

16:48.007 --> 16:52.553
"Let me just wade through this graveyard
of dead hypothetical children

16:53.846 --> 16:56.432
to try to get to
the new hypothetical kids."

16:56.515 --> 16:58.851
I'm passing the ghosts of 'em.
I'm like, "Oh, look!"

16:58.934 --> 17:01.353
"There's Olive and Basil, the twins."

17:01.895 --> 17:02.771
[laughs]

17:03.397 --> 17:06.525
They're there. They're like,
"You forgot about us."

17:07.651 --> 17:09.319
I'm like, "Oh, fuck off."

17:09.903 --> 17:14.074
There's little Clementine,
I sent her to a private school. You know?

17:14.742 --> 17:17.161
She's got a clarinet through her head.

17:17.244 --> 17:19.413
[in child's voice]
"Come and play with me."

17:19.496 --> 17:20.956
[regular voice] I'm like, "No."

17:21.040 --> 17:25.085
[chuckling] And I finally find
the new hypothetical children,

17:25.169 --> 17:28.005
I'm like, "I have no creative energy left

17:28.088 --> 17:29.381
to name these children."

17:29.465 --> 17:32.009
Like, "Can we just call them both Ian?"
I don't know.

17:34.762 --> 17:37.639
Did you guys know that…? This is true.

17:37.723 --> 17:41.560
In 2018, there were no new Ian's born.
There were no…

17:42.311 --> 17:43.270
It's a true story.

17:43.353 --> 17:48.025
In 2018, not a single new Ian registered
on this planet Earth. That is true.

17:49.443 --> 17:51.236
And if you're watching this,

17:51.779 --> 17:54.448
and you hate the show,
at least take that with you. You know?

17:55.908 --> 17:59.369
Wait, so do you guys know
what I mean when I say big ex?

17:59.453 --> 18:02.206
-Like, you have your exes.
-[scattered cheering]

18:02.289 --> 18:04.041
Okay. Really?

18:04.124 --> 18:05.959
You're like, "Yes, we know."

18:08.128 --> 18:12.674
Like you have your normal exes
and then you have, like, your big exes.

18:13.884 --> 18:17.012
Where you reach a certain page
in the novel of your life… No.

18:17.096 --> 18:21.433
Uh, I do feel you reach a certain age
and you just have to accept

18:21.517 --> 18:24.103
that for the rest of your life
there's certain names,

18:24.186 --> 18:27.856
where every time you hear them,
all of your organs are gonna dissolve.

18:29.024 --> 18:32.444
And just fall out of your vagina.

18:33.737 --> 18:35.572
Or your bum hole, if you don't…

18:36.782 --> 18:41.286
And you have to carry around a plastic bag
just in case you have to collect your…

18:42.162 --> 18:43.413
[laughs]

18:43.497 --> 18:44.748
It's disgusting.

18:44.832 --> 18:45.666
Um…

18:46.166 --> 18:48.669
So, I have a couple
of significant big exes,

18:48.752 --> 18:50.129
but I have this one who…

18:50.212 --> 18:52.047
I want to tell you this story.

18:52.131 --> 18:56.135
So basically, this ex,
it was a really intense relationship,

18:56.218 --> 18:57.427
it was like four years.

18:57.511 --> 18:59.346
And it was a secret relationship

18:59.429 --> 19:02.391
because it was her first
non-heterosexual relationship.

19:02.474 --> 19:05.394
She was like, "We can't tell anyone."
And we lived together.

19:05.477 --> 19:07.688
It was so stressful.
And she broke up with me,

19:07.771 --> 19:09.731
which is not allowed. Um…

19:10.774 --> 19:13.610
Which… I thought I had made that clear.

19:15.195 --> 19:16.822
[chuckles] Um…

19:17.489 --> 19:19.241
It was a long, drawn-out break-up.

19:19.324 --> 19:21.952
Anyway, so at the point
where this story takes place,

19:22.035 --> 19:24.663
I hadn't seen her in a year and a half
or had any contact.

19:24.746 --> 19:29.668
I was in London and I was doing a show,
and I was feeling good that night.

19:29.751 --> 19:32.004
You know what I mean?
Like, I had a fresh haircut.

19:32.087 --> 19:34.131
I was freshly shorn. You know the feeling?

19:35.132 --> 19:38.343
I was wearing a crisp black T-shirt and…

19:38.427 --> 19:39.386
[laughs]

19:40.053 --> 19:42.556
Crisper than this. I'm sorry about this.

19:42.639 --> 19:45.475
This is… crumpled.

19:45.559 --> 19:47.144
Crumplestiltskin over here.

19:47.227 --> 19:48.645
[laughing]

19:51.190 --> 19:53.025
Do you remember Rumpelstiltskin?

19:53.108 --> 19:54.902
[crowd cheering]

19:54.985 --> 19:57.696
What happened to him?
He used to be everywhere.

19:59.323 --> 20:01.241
We used to always talk about him.

20:01.325 --> 20:04.286
When you're a kid,
Rumpelstiltskin this, Rumpelstiltskin…

20:04.995 --> 20:07.039
Now you never hear about him.

20:08.582 --> 20:09.708
I get it.

20:10.918 --> 20:13.170
It's hard to stay relevant. You know?

20:13.253 --> 20:16.256
He's, like, faded into obscurity.

20:17.299 --> 20:20.636
Anyway, so I'm feeling good
on this particular night, feeling crisp.

20:20.719 --> 20:22.346
Feeling shorn, and, uh…

20:23.263 --> 20:25.933
And also my best friend Joe
was with me that night.

20:26.016 --> 20:27.976
He was in the audience of my show.

20:28.060 --> 20:30.771
I love having Joe in the audience,
he's a generous laugher.

20:30.854 --> 20:33.065
He's a real angel,
like, my best, best friend.

20:33.148 --> 20:35.442
And, um, I do the show, it goes well.

20:35.525 --> 20:39.613
And I go to the green room afterwards.
Out the green room door to meet Joe.

20:39.696 --> 20:42.491
And I'm… It was a good show.
I'm like, "Hey, man. Fun show."

20:42.574 --> 20:44.117
But he's like green.

20:44.201 --> 20:46.995
Just all the color has left his face,
and he just goes,

20:47.079 --> 20:48.080
"She's here."

20:48.872 --> 20:50.332
And I'm like, "Fuck."

20:50.415 --> 20:53.335
I know exactly who he means right away,
so I'm like, "Okay."

20:53.418 --> 20:55.128
And he goes, "Look, she's upstairs."

20:55.212 --> 20:58.465
"She doesn't know you're in the building.
She came to the bar to have a drink

20:58.548 --> 21:00.217
with some of our mutual friends."

21:00.300 --> 21:02.219
He goes, "Let's just sneak out the back."

21:02.302 --> 21:05.681
"Let's have a fun night.
We'll go to a different bar."

21:05.764 --> 21:07.557
And I thought about it.

21:10.227 --> 21:12.312
And then I thought, "No."

21:15.107 --> 21:16.817
"I don't want to have a fun night."

21:21.822 --> 21:23.782
So, I'm like, "No, we'll go upstairs."

21:23.865 --> 21:25.575
We go up, I'm feeling confident.

21:25.659 --> 21:28.412
I see, there she is
with our mutual friends and, um…

21:28.495 --> 21:32.457
You guys would have been very proud of me.
I walk over very cool. [laughs]

21:32.541 --> 21:33.917
What does that mean?

21:34.001 --> 21:35.043
I walk over…

21:36.211 --> 21:37.045
Uh…

21:37.587 --> 21:40.465
Um… No, I walk over
feeling confident. And…

21:40.549 --> 21:44.469
I'm also… I have the element of surprise.
She doesn't know I'm in the building.

21:44.553 --> 21:47.556
I think this is gonna work in my favor.
So I walk over, go, "Hey."

21:47.639 --> 21:51.101
Our mutual friends, they all know
how bad the breakup was by this point,

21:51.184 --> 21:52.394
so they see me coming.

21:55.230 --> 21:56.815
I go, "Hey, how's it going?"

21:56.898 --> 21:59.860
She's like, "Oh my God, hi."
She stands up. We hug.

21:59.943 --> 22:02.821
It's really nice.
I go, "Great to see you."

22:02.904 --> 22:05.449
"Hey, I heard you got that part,
that's so great."

22:05.532 --> 22:08.577
She's like, "Yeah. Congrats on stuff."
And I'm like, "Yeah, great."

22:08.660 --> 22:11.038
It's going well, and I suddenly think,
"You know what,

22:11.121 --> 22:13.623
I need to be the one
to end this interaction." Right?

22:13.707 --> 22:16.710
I need to retain control of the situation.
Like, I need to…

22:16.793 --> 22:20.172
We talked for a while, and I go,
"Listen, so good to see you…"

22:20.255 --> 22:22.007
She goes, "You want to sit down?"

22:22.090 --> 22:24.551
I'm, "No, no, I'm gonna hang
with my friends at the bar,

22:24.634 --> 22:27.429
but it's really nice to see you."
We hug again, she sits down.

22:27.512 --> 22:31.141
I'm walking to the bar
and she's still kinda casting glances

22:31.224 --> 22:33.393
over her shoulder as I walk to the bar.

22:34.061 --> 22:37.189
And, as I'm walking to the bar,
I suddenly realize,

22:37.773 --> 22:39.566
"What friends at the bar?"

22:41.610 --> 22:44.279
There are no friends at the bar.

22:45.364 --> 22:47.657
Joe has sat down at her table.

22:49.034 --> 22:50.535
He's a snake.

22:51.453 --> 22:52.829
He's dead to me.

22:54.623 --> 22:56.666
I'm panicking 'cause
she's still kinda looking.

22:56.750 --> 22:58.627
And I'm walking to the bar.

22:58.710 --> 23:02.756
Thank God, at the last second,
I see three girls who were in my show.

23:02.839 --> 23:04.841
They were in the front row of my show.

23:04.925 --> 23:06.593
So I'm approaching the bar,

23:06.676 --> 23:09.262
thank God, one of them goes,
"Hey, great show tonight."

23:09.346 --> 23:10.347
So I think…

23:12.933 --> 23:16.103
I think probably what
she wanted out of that interaction,

23:16.186 --> 23:19.147
like, what she expected
from that interaction, was kind of like,

23:19.231 --> 23:22.150
"Hey. Great show tonight."
"Oh, cheers, thanks for coming."

23:26.863 --> 23:31.076
What she got was so intense.

23:32.202 --> 23:35.997
I was like, "Hi, how are you?
What are all of your names and jobs?"

23:36.498 --> 23:39.251
So tactile as well. Weirdly tactile.

23:39.334 --> 23:43.088
Like my arm around all their shoulders,
like my head on their shoulder. I'm like…

23:43.171 --> 23:45.090
Mm! [laughs]

23:46.091 --> 23:48.844
They're like, "Whoa, okay. Uh…"
We're chatting.

23:48.927 --> 23:52.389
Then, thank God, we start chatting,
it's going well, we're getting along.

23:52.472 --> 23:53.849
So I'm like, "Crisis averted."

23:53.932 --> 23:57.102
They're like, "You want a drink?"
I'm like, "Yeah." We're having a drink

23:57.185 --> 24:01.731
and I suddenly feel a tap on my shoulder,
and I look around and it's my big ex.

24:01.815 --> 24:05.527
This time she has the element of surprise,
because I wasn't expecting it.

24:05.610 --> 24:09.906
She goes, "Hey, sorry to interrupt,
I want to say bye, I'm leaving now."

24:09.990 --> 24:12.868
I'm like, "Yeah, yeah." And we hug.

24:13.660 --> 24:15.495
And she said something awful, like…

24:15.579 --> 24:16.788
Like…

24:16.872 --> 24:20.041
"I'm sure our paths will cross one day."
You know what I mean?

24:20.125 --> 24:23.587
Something like that,
where all my organs dissolve.

24:23.670 --> 24:25.338
Get the plastic bag out. Oh God.

24:25.839 --> 24:27.299
Um… [laughs]

24:27.883 --> 24:30.093
And so we hug,
and she's leaving, she turns.

24:30.177 --> 24:32.804
She's still kind of
saying goodbye to some people here,

24:32.888 --> 24:34.890
and I turn back to my "friends,"

24:36.183 --> 24:39.478
and suddenly, like,
I guess I just got overwhelmed.

24:39.561 --> 24:41.605
And the floodgates just open

24:41.688 --> 24:43.273
and I just start sobbing.

24:43.356 --> 24:46.735
So… No, my face
like crumbles, my shoulders…

24:46.818 --> 24:48.612
I'm literally just like… [sobs]

24:48.695 --> 24:51.656
They're like, "Oh my God, are you okay?"
And I just go,

24:51.740 --> 24:53.950
"Laugh, laugh!" [sobs]

24:55.243 --> 24:56.286
"Laugh!"

24:57.537 --> 25:01.625
It was psychotic behavior.

25:02.125 --> 25:04.377
I'm literally like, "Fucking laugh. Ah!"

25:04.461 --> 25:05.504
[sobs]

25:06.129 --> 25:07.130
And they're all like…

25:07.214 --> 25:08.507
"Ha-ha-ha-ha."

25:10.550 --> 25:11.468
[laughs]

25:13.512 --> 25:14.596
[sighs]

25:14.679 --> 25:17.224
There's no real punchline
to that story, it's just…

25:18.099 --> 25:20.310
a vignette, if you will.

25:21.645 --> 25:24.981
To illustrate the level of emotion
I'm operating on. I mean…

25:25.565 --> 25:28.485
I have a lot of feelings.
Do you guys have a lot of feelings?

25:28.568 --> 25:31.238
[crowd whooping, clapping]

25:31.321 --> 25:32.948
It's exhausting, you know.

25:33.698 --> 25:36.660
I'm full to the absolute brim
with feelings.

25:36.743 --> 25:38.828
I always visualize, um…

25:39.579 --> 25:41.623
like Campbell's tomato soup.

25:41.706 --> 25:43.291
That it's… You know what I mean?

25:43.375 --> 25:46.086
Campbell's cream of tomato soup.
And then I'm full to brim.

25:46.169 --> 25:49.214
Right to the top of my skull,
just trying to keep it contained.

25:49.297 --> 25:52.008
Just trying to keep it
from sloshing out of my orifices

25:52.092 --> 25:56.263
as I make my way through life.
That's how I feel about my feelings.

25:56.346 --> 25:58.390
All it takes is
one person goes, "How are you?"

25:58.473 --> 25:59.641
And it's like… fling!

25:59.724 --> 26:01.351
Like, it shoots out my ear.

26:01.434 --> 26:04.104
They're like, "Oh God."
I'm like, "I'm sorry." [sobbing]

26:05.313 --> 26:07.274
[sadly] "That's not about you."

26:08.525 --> 26:09.442
[chuckles]

26:09.985 --> 26:12.487
No, I'm all right.
I got a therapist recently.

26:12.571 --> 26:14.698
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-[crowd cheering]

26:15.824 --> 26:18.952
Yeah, you have to, guys. You do. Like…

26:20.370 --> 26:23.623
Well, if you're gonna complain
as much as I complain,

26:23.707 --> 26:26.001
unfortunately, you do have to get one. Um…

26:26.626 --> 26:27.502
Yeah.

26:28.878 --> 26:31.131
I feel like my friends were
starting to be like,

26:31.214 --> 26:34.384
"You should pay someone
to do what you expect of us."

26:35.385 --> 26:37.053
I was like, "Oh, okay."

26:37.554 --> 26:41.558
I found this therapist
and he's really smart and we Zoom.

26:41.641 --> 26:43.643
And he said something interesting
where he said,

26:43.727 --> 26:45.729
"Remember, you are not the feeling."

26:45.812 --> 26:49.858
"Sure you feel consumed by the feeling,
but you are not the feeling."

26:49.941 --> 26:52.402
He said, "Within you, and within everyone,

26:52.485 --> 26:56.239
there's a very still,
neutral, eternal self."

26:56.323 --> 27:00.327
"And you experience the feelings,
but you're not consumed by them."

27:00.410 --> 27:03.747
He said, "Rather than identifying
so much with the feeling,

27:03.830 --> 27:08.126
like, 'I'm anxious, I'm this.'" He said,
"Don't be consumed by the feeling."

27:08.209 --> 27:12.255
"Just observe the feelings
as they come, with curiosity."

27:14.549 --> 27:17.344
Have you heard that before?
Apparently that's the…

27:17.427 --> 27:19.763
So I think you're
just supposed to be like, "Huh."

27:24.643 --> 27:26.102
"I'm experiencing

27:27.354 --> 27:28.229
rage."

27:31.524 --> 27:33.026
"How curious."

27:34.778 --> 27:36.404
"How curious."

27:38.573 --> 27:39.658
[laughs]

27:41.993 --> 27:45.664
I had a really, um, weird thing

27:45.747 --> 27:48.750
where, during the pandemic…
I spent the whole pandemic in London.

27:48.833 --> 27:53.088
I was just in my apartment,
in the rain, in London for… years.

27:53.171 --> 27:54.255
[laughs]

27:54.339 --> 27:58.635
And, uh, I noticed
an unexpected feeling bubbling up

27:58.718 --> 28:00.845
where I was, "Why do I feel embarrassed?"

28:00.929 --> 28:02.972
Like, I would wake up feeling embarrassed.

28:03.056 --> 28:06.768
And I was spending a lot of time,
obviously, in my apartment.

28:06.851 --> 28:09.896
in my living room,
and in my bedroom, specifically.

28:09.979 --> 28:12.691
And I was like,
"Wait, okay, maybe it's this."

28:13.274 --> 28:14.359
Okay, stay with me.

28:14.442 --> 28:17.612
Don't you think it's kind of embarrassing
that we're adults

28:17.696 --> 28:19.280
and we still have rooms?

28:20.657 --> 28:22.534
Okay, stay, wait.

28:22.617 --> 28:25.537
That we're like, "This is my room. Hm."

28:28.248 --> 28:29.666
"This is my room."

28:31.000 --> 28:32.377
"Don't go in my room."

28:32.460 --> 28:33.795
[laughs]

28:33.878 --> 28:37.173
It's embarrassing.
"I have to clean my room."

28:37.924 --> 28:42.887
And, like, please. I, of course, accept
and understand that we need rooms.

28:42.971 --> 28:47.851
You need four walls within which
to lay your weary head each night.

28:48.560 --> 28:51.187
But I think what I find
so embarrassing about it

28:51.271 --> 28:55.984
is, like, the way we decorate our rooms
to reflect our individuality.

28:56.651 --> 28:58.737
And we're like, "I'm me." Right?

29:00.029 --> 29:02.449
"I'm myself in my room."

29:02.532 --> 29:04.826
It's so embarrassing.

29:04.909 --> 29:07.078
"I have one Himalayan salt lamp."

29:08.163 --> 29:09.748
"Yes I do, and I'm me."

29:10.749 --> 29:13.126
"I have my picture on the wall and I…"

29:13.209 --> 29:15.920
When you finish reading a book,
you never get rid of it.

29:16.004 --> 29:17.881
You're like,
"I put it on the shelf in my…"

29:17.964 --> 29:21.134
"That is my personality
on display for all to see."

29:21.217 --> 29:22.469
[chuckles]

29:24.929 --> 29:26.306
"No one else is me."

29:27.849 --> 29:30.977
And then I was thinking…
Okay, this is a little abstract,

29:31.060 --> 29:34.272
but don't you think, in a way,
our brains and our minds

29:34.355 --> 29:35.690
are like our rooms,

29:35.774 --> 29:39.861
and we furnish our minds
with experiences that we collect

29:39.944 --> 29:42.739
to then build what we think of
as our identity and selves?

29:42.822 --> 29:44.240
And that's all we're doing.

29:44.324 --> 29:46.493
We're little experience hunters,
collecting these

29:46.576 --> 29:49.871
to put them on our brain shelves
and be like, "I'm me."

29:49.954 --> 29:53.166
And I always visualize
every experience that we collect

29:53.249 --> 29:55.293
is like a little novelty snow globe.

29:55.376 --> 29:57.378
We're just going around, being like,

29:57.462 --> 30:00.840
"One time I saw Antonio Banderas
at the airport. Yes, I did."

30:01.424 --> 30:03.676
"I'm myself. And no one else is me."

30:04.177 --> 30:05.553
[laughs]

30:05.637 --> 30:06.513
And then

30:07.263 --> 30:10.517
all human interaction is, really…

30:10.600 --> 30:15.021
I really noticed this coming out
of the pandemic. All interaction is just

30:15.104 --> 30:17.649
basically taking turns
showing each other our snow globes.

30:17.732 --> 30:19.275
And being like, "I…"

30:19.943 --> 30:22.987
And just pathetically taking turns.

30:23.071 --> 30:26.741
And, like, someone will be
showing you their snow globe, you know,

30:26.825 --> 30:28.701
and you're trying to be a good listener.

30:28.785 --> 30:31.246
It's a story about a party
they went to five years ago.

30:31.329 --> 30:33.873
And you're like, "Yes,
and you are you as well."

30:36.000 --> 30:38.044
Like, "Yes, exactly, yes."

30:38.127 --> 30:40.505
"How wonderful to be yourself as well."

30:41.214 --> 30:45.009
But the whole time,
your eyes are darting to your own shelf.

30:45.093 --> 30:49.097
A hundred percent, the whole time…
You're like, "Mmm, yes. Well, no. Yes."

30:49.180 --> 30:50.723
Waiting for your moment

30:51.724 --> 30:54.018
to be like, "And me as well. I have one…"

30:56.312 --> 30:57.522
-[laughs]
-[crowd cheering]

30:57.605 --> 30:58.523
Thank you.

31:09.409 --> 31:11.411
This is so exciting. You know what?

31:12.453 --> 31:13.454
I was thinking…

31:14.247 --> 31:16.374
Well, I watch a lot of stand-up specials.

31:16.457 --> 31:18.501
Then my friend's special
came out recently,

31:18.585 --> 31:20.211
and they put out the trailer.

31:20.295 --> 31:24.716
I was like, "Fuck, it's so dynamic."
Like, she's so physical onstage and doing…

31:24.799 --> 31:26.968
I was like, "I don't really move much."

31:27.051 --> 31:29.053
Like I'm very--
Then I was like, "What if?"

31:29.137 --> 31:31.598
'Cause I really want
my trailer to be dynamic.

31:31.681 --> 31:33.141
So, I was like, "What if I just…"

31:33.683 --> 31:36.477
I know in my head
the things I want to see in my trailer.

31:36.561 --> 31:39.772
I just haven't written the jokes
that go with the movements.

31:39.856 --> 31:42.275
So I was like,
"Maybe I just do the movements."

31:42.358 --> 31:45.278
And then I put it in the trailer
and it's just, like…

31:45.361 --> 31:46.446
Just like this.

31:47.280 --> 31:49.073
That's in the trailer,
how good would that be?

31:49.157 --> 31:50.575
You'd be like, "I gotta watch that."

31:52.076 --> 31:54.078
[crowd cheering]

31:55.872 --> 31:59.417
I should just have, like,
a hundred trained dogs.

31:59.500 --> 32:01.669
They all come out on the stage like this.

32:01.753 --> 32:03.504
And they're all on their hind legs jumping

32:03.588 --> 32:07.717
and then we just have it in the trailer
and never in the show.

32:08.551 --> 32:09.427
[laughs]

32:10.219 --> 32:11.179
Um…

32:12.639 --> 32:14.515
Yeah, feelings. I got a lot of feelings.

32:17.310 --> 32:21.314
So… rage, embarrassment.
These are some of the feelings. Um…

32:21.814 --> 32:24.984
Another feeling that I…
It's very dominant in my life,

32:25.068 --> 32:27.862
and I think a lot of people
relate to this, it's, like, nostalgia.

32:27.946 --> 32:29.155
I'm very nostalgic.

32:29.238 --> 32:31.407
You know?
And I know that's kind of a useless

32:31.491 --> 32:32.992
emotion, like I'm…

32:33.076 --> 32:36.746
I'm nostalgic for pre-pandemic times
and we didn't know how good we had it.

32:36.829 --> 32:40.708
I'm very nostalgic, really,
for pre-puberty, if I'm being honest.

32:41.292 --> 32:43.753
That's where it all went wrong.

32:44.420 --> 32:45.338
Like…

32:45.964 --> 32:49.133
Yeah, and my friends are like,
"Oh, yeah. You missed the '90s."

32:49.217 --> 32:51.344
That's so original.

32:51.427 --> 32:55.014
"Do you miss how all of our parents
used to have a lot of rubber bands?"

32:57.767 --> 32:59.727
Do you remember how
everyone had rubber bands?

32:59.811 --> 33:01.854
You'd find them
around drawer handles and shit.

33:01.938 --> 33:04.482
There'd be a whole ball of them.
What were they for?

33:04.565 --> 33:06.234
I have no rubber bands now.

33:09.904 --> 33:13.574
"Do you miss how all parents
had one big conch shell in the bathroom?"

33:13.658 --> 33:15.451
I'm like, "Yes. Yes, I do miss that."

33:15.952 --> 33:16.828
Yeah.

33:16.911 --> 33:20.206
And I miss the easier access
to abortion and less populism.

33:20.289 --> 33:22.709
-Yeah. You know what I mean? Yeah.
-[crowd cheering]

33:23.668 --> 33:25.712
I do feel, I think I'm someone who

33:25.795 --> 33:28.506
I never really got over puberty.

33:28.589 --> 33:30.133
Well, for a couple of reasons.

33:30.216 --> 33:32.593
I think puberty hit me
like a ton of bricks, really.

33:32.677 --> 33:37.181
First of all, I'm exactly
the demographic where, um,

33:37.265 --> 33:39.642
for me, puberty coincided almost exactly

33:39.726 --> 33:43.062
with the arrival of the Internet
and the popularization of the Internet.

33:43.146 --> 33:46.190
I'm so lucky. I had, like, one to 13,
kind of-- It wasn't around.

33:46.274 --> 33:50.319
And I remember the one computer
in our classroom got the Internet.

33:50.403 --> 33:54.407
And overnight, the world just exploded,
everything changed, it was like…

33:54.490 --> 33:56.993
We all got our first e-mail addresses.

33:57.076 --> 34:00.079
Mine was hot-mae-el@hotmail.com.

34:00.163 --> 34:02.165
[audience laughter]

34:02.248 --> 34:03.082
Thank you.

34:03.583 --> 34:06.586
Those were the days
you could get the good email addresses.

34:07.587 --> 34:11.299
But it was like overnight the world
went from being very manageable…

34:11.382 --> 34:13.301
Everything I needed to know

34:13.384 --> 34:15.762
was in just in one set
of Encyclopedia Britannica's

34:15.845 --> 34:17.138
in my parents' basement.

34:17.221 --> 34:20.641
It was so relaxing.
It was like a finite amount of facts.

34:20.725 --> 34:21.642
That was it.

34:21.726 --> 34:24.437
The nice, thin paper.
You know what I mean?

34:24.520 --> 34:27.023
It was manageable. It wasn't…

34:27.106 --> 34:29.150
Also, it was like objective truth.

34:29.233 --> 34:33.780
Like, no one was putting out
the devil's advocate set of encyclopedias.

34:33.863 --> 34:36.657
You know what I mean? Like, "Well…"

34:37.784 --> 34:40.161
"Are you sure Lima
is the capital of Peru?"

34:40.244 --> 34:42.246
Um… [chuckles]

34:43.164 --> 34:45.208
And then overnight it was like…

34:45.291 --> 34:48.377
I was obsessed with it.
I remember my friends at lunch being like,

34:48.461 --> 34:51.005
"We're gonna go out
and play at recess. Wanna come?"

34:51.089 --> 34:54.675
I'd be like, "No, there's so much work
to be done on the Internet."

34:54.759 --> 34:57.386
"There's so much going on."
I was like, "I have to

34:58.179 --> 35:00.973
copy and paste images
of <i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i>

35:02.809 --> 35:04.477
into a Word document."

35:06.562 --> 35:09.107
I then have to print that Word document.

35:09.899 --> 35:12.443
The paper will be sodden with ink.

35:13.694 --> 35:16.280
Just heavy with ink. Like…

35:17.865 --> 35:19.408
I have to cut those pictures out,

35:19.492 --> 35:21.911
and it's going to be like
cutting wet toilet paper.

35:21.994 --> 35:24.789
I then have to stick those pictures
onto my homework diary.

35:24.872 --> 35:26.541
Like, I'm busy. I--

35:27.750 --> 35:30.503
I truly feel like
I've been busy ever since.

35:30.586 --> 35:31.712
I'm exhausted.

35:32.713 --> 35:36.759
And another reason that
I think puberty really hit me was, like--

35:36.843 --> 35:39.095
Okay, so, yeah. Regular puberty stuff,

35:39.178 --> 35:42.557
then the Internet arrives
and the stuff that brings with it.

35:42.640 --> 35:47.228
And then for me, also, puberty
triggered kind of a wild gender dysphoria

35:47.311 --> 35:48.187
and a gender thing.

35:48.271 --> 35:50.189
-You know what I mean?
-[crowd] Yeah!

35:50.273 --> 35:51.440
[laughs]

35:51.524 --> 35:52.441
Uh-huh?

35:53.025 --> 35:54.527
Dead silence. Um…

35:56.571 --> 35:58.614
No, but really, like, before puberty,

35:58.698 --> 36:01.200
I felt like I was
this bounding, androgynous child,

36:01.284 --> 36:04.912
very confident,
did a lot of Ace Ventura impersonations.

36:05.621 --> 36:08.416
And then suddenly puberty hit
and my body's changing,

36:08.499 --> 36:10.835
I felt very like…
And this was the '90s too.

36:10.918 --> 36:13.671
This was the era of girl bands
and boy bands, right?

36:13.754 --> 36:16.883
This was the very pop-fueled binary.

36:16.966 --> 36:20.595
And I went to an all-girls school,
which I just, like…

36:20.678 --> 36:22.013
The ubiquitous question,

36:22.096 --> 36:25.141
the question you needed
to know an answer to at my school

36:25.224 --> 36:26.601
was which Spice Girl are you?

36:26.684 --> 36:30.104
And it was like,
there's only five possible answers.

36:30.188 --> 36:33.065
You needed to know. You'd be in the hall,

36:33.149 --> 36:35.818
and a group of girls would corner you,
"Which one are you?"

36:36.319 --> 36:38.404
'Cause they're organizing
lip-syncs and stuff.

36:38.487 --> 36:41.782
They need to know, no judgment.
They did need to know

36:41.866 --> 36:44.410
where you fit into the constellation.

36:45.453 --> 36:47.538
It was like, "Which one are you?"
And I was like,

36:47.622 --> 36:49.332
"Justin Timberlake. I don't know."

36:50.917 --> 36:51.959
"Nick Carter?"

36:53.127 --> 36:54.128
Um…

36:54.212 --> 36:58.174
I think, regardless,
if you experience gender stuff,

36:58.257 --> 37:00.468
puberty anyway is a fucking nightmare.

37:00.551 --> 37:02.094
Like, you feel like an alien,

37:02.178 --> 37:05.932
and everything that was cool about you
just becomes worthless overnight.

37:06.015 --> 37:09.060
Like, okay, I had this trick.

37:09.143 --> 37:12.438
Okay, well, it's a noise
that I can make with my hand.

37:12.521 --> 37:15.399
And I swear, it was really popular.

37:15.483 --> 37:18.152
People loved when I did it,
it killed at parties.

37:18.945 --> 37:20.780
I'm going to do it for you now. Uh…

37:21.405 --> 37:23.157
Okay, maybe some of you remember this.

37:23.241 --> 37:25.034
Um, okay, this is the noise.

37:26.494 --> 37:31.165
[high-pitched vibrating vocalizing
of "The Lion Sleeps Tonight"]

37:32.333 --> 37:33.459
Do you remember that?

37:35.211 --> 37:38.172
Guys, I swear, it used to kill at parties.

37:38.256 --> 37:40.508
People would request it,
they'd be like, "Do the noise."

37:40.591 --> 37:41.926
I'd be like, "Okay."

37:42.426 --> 37:44.095
I did it in a school assembly once.

37:44.178 --> 37:47.223
That was… That was too far, but, um…

37:48.140 --> 37:51.018
It was really cool, and then,
all of a sudden puberty hit,

37:51.102 --> 37:53.521
suddenly I'm at a house party,
I'm in a cupboard

37:53.604 --> 37:56.565
with a pimply 13-year-old boy
who's got a semi, and I'm like…

37:56.649 --> 37:58.317
[vocalizing "The Lion Sleeps Tonight"]

37:58.859 --> 38:00.861
And he's like, "What the fuck?"

38:04.365 --> 38:07.702
He's like, "I thought you were
gonna give me a hand job." I'm like, "No."

38:08.953 --> 38:10.371
"I said...

38:11.414 --> 38:14.834
that I could do something cool
with my hand."

38:14.917 --> 38:16.919
[cheering]

38:17.545 --> 38:21.549
He leaves me alone in the cupboard.
I'm there in the dark by myself, like…

38:21.632 --> 38:27.471
[vocalizing "Mad World"]

38:32.101 --> 38:33.394
Really mournful.

38:33.477 --> 38:35.479
[cheering]

38:36.564 --> 38:39.233
It's hard to live at that age.
It's really… I mean…

38:40.526 --> 38:43.237
Don't you think
that the only way to flirt when you're 13,

38:43.321 --> 38:46.449
the only acceptable way, is to go,
"How big are your hands?"

38:46.532 --> 38:49.076
That's… Don't you think?
Do you remember that?

38:49.160 --> 38:52.955
"How big are your hands?"
I still kinda think that's a great move

38:53.456 --> 38:56.042
to make physical contact
with someone that you like.

38:56.125 --> 38:58.002
Except I was at my all-girls school,

38:58.085 --> 39:01.839
just sort of slightly getting it wrong.
"Yeah, my hands are pretty massive."

39:03.049 --> 39:05.176
"Yeah, yours are tiny, of course."

39:06.886 --> 39:10.139
Going around the playground, being like,
"Well, you know what they say."

39:17.563 --> 39:19.899
"Big hands, massive labia."

39:23.861 --> 39:24.987
[laughs]

39:26.113 --> 39:26.989
[exhales]

39:27.615 --> 39:28.449
But…

39:29.116 --> 39:31.494
So all that was going on, you know?

39:31.577 --> 39:35.373
And I think for everyone,
at puberty, you do kind of…

39:35.873 --> 39:38.626
You develop critical thinking
and suddenly, sort of,

39:38.709 --> 39:41.462
the hard facts of life are hitting you.

39:41.545 --> 39:44.090
I think if you're, like,
different in any way,

39:44.173 --> 39:48.052
like, if the dominant narrative
that's being told to you by everyone

39:48.135 --> 39:50.971
doesn't match what you're experiencing,
know what I mean?

39:51.055 --> 39:55.142
Like, with gender, people being like,
"There's two. And you're a woman

39:55.226 --> 39:57.478
and this is what it's like."
And you're like, "Okay."

39:57.561 --> 40:00.523
But you're experiencing
something completely different.

40:00.606 --> 40:02.358
Then you kind of have two options.

40:02.441 --> 40:05.694
You can either question the validity
of yourself and your experience

40:05.778 --> 40:10.616
or you can question the validity
of everything else and the whole system.

40:10.699 --> 40:13.411
Once you start pulling that thread,
you're fucked. It's like…

40:14.078 --> 40:15.287
Monogamy, you're like…

40:15.371 --> 40:18.833
Can I bring two people to prom?
Why not? I don't get why not.

40:19.959 --> 40:21.961
And I really felt-- And also, like…

40:22.044 --> 40:28.217
For me, I, um, I started doing comedy
when I was 13 and I discovered…

40:28.300 --> 40:30.511
I got really into drugs,
like psychedelic drugs.

40:30.594 --> 40:34.390
So that just exacerbated
the general existential wave.

40:34.473 --> 40:38.185
Like I felt like I was peeling
back the wallpaper on reality

40:38.269 --> 40:42.106
and I was seeing this very flimsy
scaffolding holding everything up.

40:42.189 --> 40:43.732
I was just like, "What is going on?"

40:43.816 --> 40:46.694
You suddenly realize
your parents are flawed,

40:46.777 --> 40:49.363
your teachers are,
like, lonely or something.

40:50.531 --> 40:52.825
I remember being,
"Mm, I think Ms. Buchanan's lonely."

40:52.908 --> 40:56.412
"I feel a huge amount of pressure
to laugh at her jokes. And I don't know."

40:56.495 --> 40:57.496
Um…

40:59.206 --> 41:02.751
And yeah, I remember
being really stressed by

41:02.835 --> 41:06.589
why don't we, as a society,
talk more about the fact that

41:06.672 --> 41:09.133
the movie <i>Antz </i>and the movie <i>A Bug's Life</i>

41:10.593 --> 41:12.720
came out in the same year.

41:14.972 --> 41:18.559
Surely, powerful forces are at play here

41:19.185 --> 41:22.354
and we're just not going to address it?
Like what the…

41:26.609 --> 41:28.277
Um… Yeah.

41:30.070 --> 41:33.532
So, yeah, I was stressed and…

41:34.867 --> 41:38.204
And also, I think with drugs,
it was a way to get out of my body.

41:38.287 --> 41:41.790
I was feeling very uncomfortable
in my body and it was this trap door.

41:41.874 --> 41:44.793
And so I got heavily into drugs,
and the bullet points are,

41:44.877 --> 41:47.588
I went from psychedelics
into, like, the really bad ones.

41:47.671 --> 41:50.424
I got kicked out of my house.
I dropped out of school.

41:50.508 --> 41:53.093
Fast-forward, I ended up in rehab.

41:53.177 --> 41:56.180
When I was 19,
I went to a rehab day program

41:56.263 --> 41:57.598
for nine months. Uh…

41:58.098 --> 42:00.976
A rehab day program for teens,

42:01.060 --> 42:02.645
objectively, a bad idea.

42:02.728 --> 42:03.812
Well, in a way, right?

42:03.896 --> 42:05.856
Like, you get a group
of teenagers together,

42:05.940 --> 42:08.192
all they have in common
is they love doing drugs.

42:08.275 --> 42:11.237
Every day, at 3:00 p.m., the bell goes

42:11.320 --> 42:13.989
and they're like,
"Off you go with your new friends."

42:15.032 --> 42:17.910
"Run along. Bond in the alleyways."

42:18.536 --> 42:20.538
"The only way you know how." [laughs]

42:21.330 --> 42:23.832
Um, but it was very eye-opening for me.

42:23.916 --> 42:26.585
It was a big turning point
because I got into this program

42:26.669 --> 42:28.754
and there were 12 other kids in there.

42:28.837 --> 42:30.589
I was suddenly like, "Oh, fuck."

42:30.673 --> 42:33.342
These kids have come
from actually difficult lives,

42:33.425 --> 42:36.011
and difficult family situations.
Like who am I? You know?

42:36.095 --> 42:39.890
I'm this privileged, middle-class kid.
What am I rebelling against, really?

42:39.974 --> 42:44.436
But I needed to be there, and it was good.
I wanted to fit in with all these kids.

42:44.520 --> 42:46.730
They'd been there a while,
they were all really bonded.

42:46.814 --> 42:48.816
And they had nicknames for each other.

42:48.899 --> 42:52.194
I've never had a nickname
and I wanted to be in on it.

42:52.278 --> 42:55.656
I was very excited because
after like two months in the program,

42:55.739 --> 42:58.033
I came in one morning
and one of the guys goes,

42:58.117 --> 42:59.702
"Yo, Bath Water, what's up?"

43:00.911 --> 43:02.997
I was like, "Bath Water?"

43:03.706 --> 43:06.584
And they all start calling me Bath Water.

43:07.293 --> 43:09.837
Then the teacher starts calling me…
It catches on.

43:09.920 --> 43:11.880
The teachers are,
"Good morning, Bath Water."

43:11.964 --> 43:13.716
I'm like, "What is happening?"

43:13.799 --> 43:15.593
But I get into it. I don't want to admit

43:15.676 --> 43:17.886
that I don't know why
they're calling me Bath Water.

43:17.970 --> 43:19.805
I'm like, "Yup. Not much. All good."

43:19.888 --> 43:24.101
Yeah. And then finally,
I get comfortable enough with them

43:24.184 --> 43:25.519
and we all get close.

43:25.603 --> 43:28.355
I'm like, "Guys, I've been meaning
to ask you for months."

43:28.439 --> 43:30.399
"Why do you call me, Bath Water?"

43:30.482 --> 43:33.402
And they said,
"Oh, it's because when you arrived,

43:33.485 --> 43:35.029
we all had a conversation

43:35.112 --> 43:39.825
and decided you look like the type of kid
who would drink their own bath water."

43:41.410 --> 43:42.286
It's…

43:43.912 --> 43:45.456
so specific.

43:47.207 --> 43:48.667
So insulting.

43:49.501 --> 43:51.128
And creative, yes.

43:52.379 --> 43:53.380
Drink their own…

43:53.464 --> 43:56.258
I mean, look,
I've drunk some bath water in my time.

43:56.342 --> 43:57.259
Sure.

43:57.885 --> 43:59.303
Haven't we all?

44:01.472 --> 44:03.599
I mean, not like with… [glugs]

44:03.682 --> 44:04.725
[laughs]

44:05.225 --> 44:06.685
With a straw. Just…

44:09.063 --> 44:10.356
No, but, like, we all…

44:11.190 --> 44:13.067
We've all drunk some, haven't we?

44:13.150 --> 44:15.235
Okay, wait. Do you remember bath time?

44:15.736 --> 44:16.820
Remember bath time?

44:16.904 --> 44:20.532
Did you ever, um, in bath time,
take your wet flannel…

44:20.616 --> 44:22.660
Do you call it a flannel or a facecloth?

44:22.743 --> 44:24.703
Flannel? Yeah. Canada, yeah.

44:24.787 --> 44:25.663
[laughs]

44:25.746 --> 44:27.539
Did you ever take your wet flannel

44:27.623 --> 44:30.334
and lie it on your face,
and breathe through it?

44:30.417 --> 44:33.337
And then you suddenly feel like
you're waterboarding yourself?

44:33.420 --> 44:34.838
You're like, "Oh no, God!"

44:35.923 --> 44:38.592
Or did you ever suck
the water out of your flannel?

44:39.093 --> 44:39.927
Right?

44:40.427 --> 44:43.597
It feels so squeaky on your…
What a feeling.

44:45.849 --> 44:46.767
Bath time.

44:47.518 --> 44:48.686
You know what I mean?

44:49.853 --> 44:51.063
Know what I miss most?

44:51.146 --> 44:54.900
I'll move on from bath time,
but I will just quickly say

44:54.983 --> 44:57.111
what I miss most about bath time is just

44:57.194 --> 44:59.446
once a day, somebody going,
"Uh, it's bath time."

45:00.614 --> 45:01.907
How good is that?

45:01.990 --> 45:03.992
I feel like we don't appreciate it
when we're young,

45:04.076 --> 45:06.620
but imagine you're on
a shitty Tinder date,

45:06.704 --> 45:08.706
and the waiter comes over, they're like,

45:08.789 --> 45:12.543
"I'm so sorry to interrupt.
Um, it is bath time for you."

45:12.626 --> 45:14.586
You're like… You'd be out of there.

45:15.421 --> 45:17.423
[crowd cheering]

45:18.090 --> 45:20.342
Youth is wasted on the young. You know?

45:21.677 --> 45:23.262
Youth is wasted on the young.

45:23.887 --> 45:24.763
Um…

45:25.347 --> 45:27.015
Yeah, so that's… Yeah.

45:27.099 --> 45:30.352
I think the reason
that I obsess over my teens,

45:30.436 --> 45:33.105
and I'm constantly processing it,

45:33.188 --> 45:35.899
is that I feel like
a completely different person now.

45:35.983 --> 45:38.861
And I did have this kind
of chaotic adolescence,

45:38.944 --> 45:41.155
and it was really dark, like it was crazy.

45:41.238 --> 45:43.907
Now I feel truly
like a completely different person.

45:43.991 --> 45:45.701
Like, I'm very risk averse now.

45:45.784 --> 45:47.077
You… Yeah.

45:48.328 --> 45:51.039
You should see me
on an escalator, it's insane.

45:51.123 --> 45:53.083
I hold so tight to the railing.

45:53.167 --> 45:54.793
I'm very like… [chuckles]

45:54.877 --> 45:56.795
As the thing's approaching, "Oh my God."

45:56.879 --> 45:59.006
I'm like, "One, two, three, go."

45:59.089 --> 46:00.215
Waiting for my moment.

46:00.299 --> 46:01.842
[nervous laugh]

46:02.384 --> 46:05.012
If I'm not ready and it's coming,
I'm walking backwards.

46:05.095 --> 46:06.221
I'm going, "Okay…"

46:06.764 --> 46:07.848
"One, two…"

46:07.931 --> 46:09.933
[chuckling] Yeah. Yeah.

46:11.643 --> 46:13.645
But I do still… I feel different.

46:13.729 --> 46:17.399
I do, I guess, still get
that self-destructive feeling.

46:17.483 --> 46:19.234
Like, that pressure building up.

46:19.318 --> 46:21.820
I feel like we all
kind of sometimes have those impulses

46:21.904 --> 46:25.073
and you have to find the healthy way
to deal with those feelings.

46:25.574 --> 46:27.659
Um, I do a lot of escape rooms.

46:28.285 --> 46:30.537
I'm always escaping a room.

46:31.413 --> 46:32.956
Constantly. Um…

46:33.499 --> 46:37.753
Like, I was on tour recently
and touring is intense.

46:37.836 --> 46:39.171
Also, I tour by myself.

46:39.254 --> 46:42.800
I don't usually have an opening act,
or a tour manager, or whatever.

46:42.883 --> 46:44.259
I just travel by myself.

46:44.343 --> 46:47.471
I have these long days
in these random cities in the UK.

46:47.554 --> 46:49.556
And I was doing a show in Edinburgh.

46:49.640 --> 46:52.017
I was Scotland,
in Edinburgh, by myself for the day,

46:52.100 --> 46:55.521
and I was having the feeling
of pressure building up.

46:55.604 --> 46:56.688
You know what I mean?

46:56.772 --> 46:59.650
And, like, I had just seen
<i>Trainspotting, </i>so I was like,

46:59.733 --> 47:01.151
"We're in the danger zone."

47:01.235 --> 47:03.278
And, uh, I said, "What should I do?"

47:03.362 --> 47:06.573
So I go online and I found
the Edinburgh dungeons were open.

47:06.657 --> 47:10.285
That's kind of like the London dungeons,
where it's like this horror,

47:10.369 --> 47:12.079
immersive horror experience,

47:12.162 --> 47:14.998
where actors dress up
like Victorians and scare you.

47:15.082 --> 47:17.209
And you walk through a maze of hell.

47:17.292 --> 47:19.294
So I was like, "Great." Um…

47:19.378 --> 47:21.713
And I got the VIP package as well,

47:21.797 --> 47:23.632
which is just you pay 20 extra bucks

47:23.715 --> 47:26.885
and all it meant was, when I arrived,
they take a picture of you

47:26.969 --> 47:28.303
in front of a green screen.

47:28.387 --> 47:31.056
And then they give you a key
and they project a graveyard

47:31.139 --> 47:32.558
and give you the keychain of the…

47:32.641 --> 47:36.436
That was when I was like, "Oh. This is
something you should do with friends."

47:36.937 --> 47:37.980
[laughs]

47:38.564 --> 47:40.190
Friends or loved ones.

47:40.274 --> 47:43.193
I do now have a keychain that's just…

47:47.614 --> 47:48.490
So,

47:49.491 --> 47:52.661
I go down and it's me
and this group of strangers

47:52.744 --> 47:56.373
and we're going to go together
as a group through this horror maze.

47:56.456 --> 47:59.459
It's tourists and families,
there's like ten of us.

47:59.543 --> 48:02.254
We're about to go through it,
and this guy comes out,

48:02.337 --> 48:04.965
and he's dressed
like a kind of Victorian butcher.

48:05.048 --> 48:07.759
He's covered in blood
and he's got a big butcher's knife,

48:07.843 --> 48:10.971
big beard, Scottish guy,
and he goes, "I'm the butcher!"

48:11.054 --> 48:12.848
I can't do the accent very well.

48:13.348 --> 48:15.475
He's like, "Welcome to
the Edinburgh dungeons,

48:15.559 --> 48:18.729
we're gonna fucking kill you."
And I'm like, "Yes!"

48:19.313 --> 48:21.815
"Yes, I've been praying for death!" Um…

48:22.858 --> 48:27.237
Then he goes, "But first,
I do have a few safety announcements. Um…"

48:27.321 --> 48:32.117
"If you are pregnant or you do
have epilepsy, don't go in the dungeon."

48:32.200 --> 48:33.160
Uh…

48:33.243 --> 48:35.162
I'm like, "Okay." Then he said,

48:35.662 --> 48:39.708
"At no point will any of the actors
in the dungeon touch you or grab you."

48:39.791 --> 48:41.668
So I was like, "That's good." Right?

48:41.752 --> 48:43.962
Nobody wants to be grabbed in the dunge.

48:44.046 --> 48:44.963
So I was like,

48:45.464 --> 48:46.506
"Sweet." Um…

48:47.424 --> 48:51.053
So we start going through
and guys, it's so scary.

48:51.136 --> 48:55.140
Like it's just… I'm quaking with fear.

48:55.223 --> 48:57.059
I'm with these strangers going through.

48:57.142 --> 49:00.687
They do this thing where they love
to turn off all the lights, pitch-black.

49:00.771 --> 49:04.441
And then when they come back on, there's
a woman standing an inch from your face

49:04.524 --> 49:05.776
and being like… [growls]

49:06.401 --> 49:09.029
It's so scary,
but I'm loving it. I'm like, "Ah."

49:09.112 --> 49:12.407
There's sort of a narrative arc
where, at the very beginning,

49:12.491 --> 49:16.912
the butcher was like, "You're gonna meet
the legendary cannibal Sawney Bean."

49:16.995 --> 49:20.999
Does anybody know Sawney Bean?
Legendary cannibal, apparently, and…

49:21.875 --> 49:25.921
We're like, "We don't want to meet him.
We're frightened."

49:26.004 --> 49:28.173
He's like, "Oh no.
He's going to love you guys."

49:28.256 --> 49:29.967
We know it's building to something.

49:30.050 --> 49:34.972
And we get to this part where
there's a sort of boat underground,

49:35.055 --> 49:36.974
we're in the bowels of Edinburgh, right?

49:37.057 --> 49:40.143
And there's a boat
on a track and we all get in it.

49:40.227 --> 49:42.354
And we can hear
Sawney Bean in the darkness,

49:42.437 --> 49:43.981
toward where we're headed,

49:44.064 --> 49:46.566
going, "I'm Sawney Bean."
We're like, "No!"

49:47.067 --> 49:50.737
The butcher goes, "Okay, guys,
you're on your own now. I'm leaving you."

49:50.821 --> 49:53.824
We're like "No, wait.
We've learned to love you, we need you."

49:54.324 --> 49:56.576
He's like "Fuck you, guys" and he leaves.

49:56.660 --> 49:59.246
Now it's me and my group
and we're in the little boat.

49:59.329 --> 50:01.915
The lights go off and it's pitch-black.

50:01.999 --> 50:04.668
You can't see your hand
in front of your face, it's so dark,

50:04.751 --> 50:06.336
and it's damp and it's cold.

50:06.420 --> 50:09.214
We can hear, "I'm Sawney Bean."
And I'm freaking out.

50:09.297 --> 50:13.885
Then I feel these hands on my back.

50:13.969 --> 50:16.179
Going up my back,

50:16.263 --> 50:18.223
and kind of coming around my neck.

50:18.306 --> 50:20.892
And I'm freaking out
because I'm remembering

50:20.976 --> 50:23.729
they're not allowed
to touch you in the dunge. Right?

50:24.688 --> 50:27.691
I'm like, "What's happening?"
The lights come back, I spin round,

50:27.774 --> 50:32.112
and there's just this middle-aged woman
who's part of our group.

50:35.282 --> 50:36.575
And she just goes…

50:36.658 --> 50:38.118
[spookily] "Ooh!"

50:39.119 --> 50:39.953
It was…

50:41.246 --> 50:42.289
insane.

50:43.790 --> 50:44.916
"Ooh-hoo-ooh."

50:46.251 --> 50:49.087
And she was
with her two teenaged daughters

50:49.171 --> 50:51.590
who are sitting
on either side of her. They're like,

50:51.673 --> 50:53.842
"Mom, what the fuck are you doing?"

50:54.843 --> 50:56.094
She's like, "Ooh."

50:58.138 --> 51:00.599
I think about her all the time.

51:02.684 --> 51:05.479
She's like the mailman.
She's a hero, you know.

51:05.562 --> 51:06.980
A hero to us all.

51:07.064 --> 51:08.190
[laughs]

51:13.111 --> 51:17.616
But, yeah, I do things like that
to, you know, to feel alive and, um…

51:19.409 --> 51:23.872
Yeah, I try to be
very vigilant about my brain

51:23.955 --> 51:26.833
because I have a lot of shame
about my teens.

51:26.917 --> 51:31.296
I behaved very badly. You know?
I was very self-destructive and I…

51:32.214 --> 51:36.134
The weird thing is I was so angry,
I was really angry. And, uh…

51:36.635 --> 51:39.596
The weird thing is since, like, 2016…

51:39.679 --> 51:44.309
I remember when Trump got elected.
I was like, "So we can't deny anymore

51:44.392 --> 51:48.146
that the world is slightly off its axis."
It's a little fucked, right?

51:48.230 --> 51:51.149
We have so much information
available to us now,

51:51.233 --> 51:54.152
it's hard to deny the system
doesn't work for everyone.

51:54.694 --> 51:57.656
Like, billionaires don't pay taxes
and all the stuff we know.

51:57.739 --> 52:00.867
So I'm like, "Okay,
in a way, my anger was valid."

52:00.951 --> 52:04.663
I think a lot of teenagers feel
this righteous indignation and stuff.

52:04.746 --> 52:08.083
But the method of my rebellion
was garbage.

52:08.166 --> 52:12.546
Like, it was so self-destructive
and self-involved.

52:12.629 --> 52:16.174
You know, it was impotent, ultimately.
I got this tattoo

52:16.258 --> 52:18.593
when I was 16. It says, "Oatmeal."

52:18.677 --> 52:19.553
Um…

52:20.303 --> 52:21.972
It says, "Oatmeal," twice.

52:23.306 --> 52:26.309
I remember being like,
"Fuck the man, you know."

52:26.393 --> 52:28.019
Like, what?

52:29.813 --> 52:30.814
[chuckles]

52:36.862 --> 52:38.488
So that's there for good. Uh…

52:39.447 --> 52:41.449
[scattered cheers]

52:43.535 --> 52:44.536
I…

52:45.453 --> 52:47.164
I remember feeling like…

52:47.873 --> 52:51.334
I felt like the world was a house
that had been sold to me

52:51.418 --> 52:54.880
at a very young age when I was
too young to be signing mortgages.

52:54.963 --> 52:57.549
A house that was sold to me
by a really shady realtor.

52:57.632 --> 52:59.551
Like, a kind of greasy, with a…

52:59.634 --> 53:01.303
A doggy-style baby realtor.

53:02.137 --> 53:05.599
[grumbling] "Sign here, kid."
And I'm like, "Okay."

53:05.682 --> 53:09.227
"All your dreams will come true."
I sign it, suddenly I'm in this house.

53:09.311 --> 53:12.647
You develop critical thinking.
You wake up in the house in your teens.

53:12.731 --> 53:13.899
You're like, "Wait."

53:14.399 --> 53:16.860
Hang on, the foundations
of the house are rotten,

53:16.943 --> 53:19.613
the backyard's on fire
'cause the previous owners

53:19.696 --> 53:22.282
kept heating it
with fossil fuels exclusively.

53:22.365 --> 53:24.993
So my reaction was, I thought,

53:25.076 --> 53:27.829
"All right, I'll just bulldoze
the house with myself in it."

53:28.371 --> 53:32.083
And of course, now I realize
what I should have done

53:32.584 --> 53:35.212
is put any amount of energy
into fixing the house, right?

53:35.295 --> 53:36.630
That's what we need to do is…

53:36.713 --> 53:39.674
That's hopefully what
we're trying to do. We have to, right?

53:39.758 --> 53:42.677
Put some energy into making
the house a nicer place to live.

53:42.761 --> 53:44.971
-'Cause it won't do it… Yeah.
-[crowd cheering]

53:47.307 --> 53:49.434
I do feel we have to consciously do it.

53:49.517 --> 53:51.561
Or else it won't happen. You know? Um…

53:51.645 --> 53:53.688
And that's why I am really… I love…

53:54.189 --> 53:56.608
I feel like Gen Z is incredible.

53:56.691 --> 53:59.402
I don't believe that they're
just on TikTok. I think they're wicked.

53:59.486 --> 54:01.571
They're out there. They're doing stuff.

54:02.197 --> 54:06.076
You know, protesting climate change
and dismantling rigid gender binaries.

54:06.159 --> 54:07.202
What was I doing?

54:07.285 --> 54:10.455
I was slithering around being like,
"Does anyone have any acid?"

54:10.538 --> 54:11.623
[laughs awkwardly]

54:11.706 --> 54:14.000
Just like useless behavior.

54:16.795 --> 54:18.296
And they're wicked.

54:19.214 --> 54:20.757
I want to talk about…

54:20.840 --> 54:24.386
I want to talk about, like,
the gender thing for a sec.

54:25.387 --> 54:26.221
So…

54:26.304 --> 54:27.931
[crowd cheering]

54:28.014 --> 54:31.643
Just because I've been in the UK,
and now I'm in the States,

54:31.726 --> 54:35.981
and in both places there's
a real hysteria right now around gender

54:36.064 --> 54:37.065
and gender identity.

54:37.148 --> 54:40.527
And I think part of it comes
from this misconception

54:40.610 --> 54:43.905
that it's a recent Gen Z fad.
Or a millennial fad, right?

54:43.989 --> 54:47.075
To have this fluidity
around gender, it's like…

54:47.158 --> 54:50.328
Of course-- As long as
there's been human civilization,

54:50.412 --> 54:52.664
we know, right,
there's been variances in gender.

54:52.747 --> 54:56.793
There's been different cultures
that recognize third and fourth genders.

54:56.876 --> 54:58.878
Not just recognize, revere.

54:59.546 --> 55:01.089
Like I could have been revered.

55:02.048 --> 55:03.675
I could have been revered.

55:04.217 --> 55:05.135
It sucks.

55:05.218 --> 55:08.388
And instead I'm like, "Which bathroom
am I allowed to use, please?"

55:09.055 --> 55:09.931
Um…

55:10.974 --> 55:16.021
And really it is a recent colonial fad
to have this very rigid gender binary.

55:16.104 --> 55:20.358
It's really like we just went around
the world bulldozing over the nuances of

55:20.900 --> 55:22.569
all these beautiful things. Um…

55:22.652 --> 55:24.821
In the UK, where I've been living,

55:24.904 --> 55:28.908
I remember in 2018,
India decriminalized homosexuality,

55:28.992 --> 55:29.951
and it was great.

55:30.035 --> 55:33.621
Like, big celebration, really exciting,
but it was really frustrating

55:33.705 --> 55:36.624
'cause the coverage of it
on the news in the UK was so smug.

55:36.708 --> 55:39.502
It was like, "It's about time, India."

55:39.586 --> 55:43.840
And it's like, England went into India
and criminalized homosexuality

55:44.341 --> 55:46.217
in 1896. Like, it's…

55:46.718 --> 55:49.179
It's the ultimate gaslighting.

55:49.721 --> 55:52.557
It's like lighting someone's house
on fire and being like,

55:52.640 --> 55:55.935
"It's really awkward how long
it's taking out to put that out."

55:56.519 --> 55:57.812
"It's so embarrassing."

55:58.646 --> 56:00.857
-[crowd cheering]
-Yeah. Thanks.

56:05.904 --> 56:06.988
Um… Yeah.

56:07.489 --> 56:09.574
And the annoying thing is

56:10.533 --> 56:13.328
I don't really want to talk about gender

56:13.411 --> 56:15.038
because it's kind of lose-lose, right?

56:15.121 --> 56:17.999
Especially if it's something that
personally affects you and you care about

56:18.083 --> 56:19.959
then it's hard to debate.

56:20.043 --> 56:21.628
You get emotional, you've already lost.

56:21.711 --> 56:23.505
'Cause you're like…
[frustrated whimpering]

56:23.588 --> 56:26.800
Like, it's hard,
but I feel like I should talk about it

56:26.883 --> 56:30.053
because everyone else is. Like, comedians.

56:30.136 --> 56:34.557
Big multimillionaire comedians,
in their stand-up specials are, like,

56:34.641 --> 56:36.684
taking shots and punching down

56:36.768 --> 56:39.771
at a time when
trans rights are so tenuous,

56:39.854 --> 56:42.023
and slipping backwards, it's just not…

56:42.107 --> 56:43.483
-Yeah. And, uh…
-[applause]

56:43.566 --> 56:45.610
No, no, no. But I feel…

56:46.611 --> 56:48.863
You're like,
"Yeah, they're slipping backwards, yeah."

56:48.947 --> 56:50.073
No, just kidding.

56:50.156 --> 56:51.825
I'm suddenly like, "Oh, fuck."

56:51.908 --> 56:53.243
[Mae laughs]

56:54.035 --> 56:57.497
The thing… And I watch
those specials so I can be informed

56:57.580 --> 57:01.459
when I'm asked in every interview
to talk about those guys' specials.

57:01.543 --> 57:05.922
But, like, the thing that
kept coming up was, "Gender's a fact."

57:06.005 --> 57:08.174
That was the refrain of one,
"Gender's a fact."

57:08.258 --> 57:12.303
Then they cut to the audience. "Aw, yeah."
They're loving it. And it's like, um…

57:12.387 --> 57:15.557
I feel like I'm kind of preaching
to the choir a little here, but

57:16.057 --> 57:21.563
just to quickly say… Of course,
biological sex is real. It's a thing.

57:21.646 --> 57:25.024
Within that, there's tons of variation,
it's very much like…

57:25.108 --> 57:28.945
Scientifically, it's not as binary
as we think. There's intersex people,

57:29.028 --> 57:31.406
there's hormonal variation,
all kinds of stuff.

57:31.489 --> 57:34.451
But, yeah, for sure, biological sex,
no one denies is real,

57:34.534 --> 57:38.246
but gender is so much more ephemeral
and much more what to do with

57:38.329 --> 57:39.706
what's in here and in here.

57:39.789 --> 57:42.584
Very much like,
you know, a social construct.

57:42.667 --> 57:43.585
And more fluid.

57:43.668 --> 57:46.212
And the way I explain it to people
who are trying to understand

57:46.296 --> 57:49.549
the difference between
biological sex and gender is

57:49.632 --> 57:51.718
I picture the gender spectrum.

57:52.385 --> 57:54.262
You know the movie<i> Beauty and the Beast?</i>

57:54.971 --> 57:55.972
Okay.

57:56.055 --> 58:00.018
So imagine if at one end of
the gender spectrum, you have Gaston.

58:00.101 --> 58:02.520
You remember him?
He's like, "No one fights like…"

58:02.604 --> 58:03.813
Hot. He's hot.

58:03.897 --> 58:06.483
He's like extreme masculinity.

58:06.566 --> 58:08.818
On the other end of the spectrum
you have Belle,

58:08.902 --> 58:11.029
who has Stockholm Syndrome.

58:12.030 --> 58:13.573
So dark, but, um…

58:14.324 --> 58:17.035
But, guys, she's still
an excellent role model

58:17.118 --> 58:18.745
because she can read.

58:20.371 --> 58:21.623
She loves a book.

58:22.499 --> 58:24.042
You got to hand it to her. Um…

58:25.043 --> 58:28.880
And then in the middle of the spectrum,
you have the candlestick, right?

58:29.589 --> 58:31.049
You have Lumière.

58:31.674 --> 58:34.385
And I really relate to Lumière.

58:34.469 --> 58:36.054
I connect with Lumière.

58:36.846 --> 58:39.516
And obviously the more we empower Lumière,

58:39.599 --> 58:41.601
the more fun
Gaston and Belle are gonna have.

58:41.684 --> 58:44.729
Lumière's throwing parties.
They're like, "Be my guest!"

58:45.605 --> 58:46.439
Yeah.

58:47.273 --> 58:48.691
I have this fantasy.

58:49.234 --> 58:51.152
I have this fantasy that like…

58:52.028 --> 58:54.030
It's a really clear image in my head of…

58:54.113 --> 58:57.492
You got Dave Chappelle,
Ricky Gervais, Louis C.K.

58:57.575 --> 59:01.371
Throw Joe Rogan in there.
And they're eating a hog roast.

59:01.454 --> 59:04.290
In this fantasy, it's a huge hog,
and they're ripping the flesh off it.

59:04.374 --> 59:05.333
[chomping sounds]

59:05.416 --> 59:08.169
They're drinking goblets of mead.

59:08.253 --> 59:10.588
That medieval drink.
They're throwing their money.

59:10.672 --> 59:12.840
And then they turn the TV on

59:12.924 --> 59:16.010
and they see me doing my
little <i>Beauty and the Beast</i> gender…

59:16.094 --> 59:17.637
Just like… "And the candlestick."

59:18.972 --> 59:22.684
And they're watching it, and are like,
"Oh my God, we… Guys."

59:23.184 --> 59:24.185
"We were wrong."

59:25.270 --> 59:26.187
"Oh."

59:26.271 --> 59:27.814
-And then they just…
-[crowd cheering]

59:27.897 --> 59:29.023
That's my fantasy.

59:29.107 --> 59:32.068
Then they just like…
You know what I want? I want them to…

59:32.819 --> 59:34.362
I want them to cradle each other.

59:34.445 --> 59:37.740
I want them to hold each other gently,
and just gently rock.

59:38.283 --> 59:40.994
I want them
to re-parent themselves, basically.

59:41.536 --> 59:42.870
Just give a little… That.

59:43.454 --> 59:45.915
'Cause I do understand too. I get it.

59:45.999 --> 59:48.459
It's hard to learn new language. You know?

59:48.543 --> 59:50.545
Although, is it? Like…

59:51.170 --> 59:53.339
Omicron, you know?

59:54.299 --> 59:56.759
We picked that up pretty fast. Um…

59:58.052 --> 59:59.387
But the…

1:00:00.221 --> 1:00:02.473
The joke I always hear,
and this has been a joke…

1:00:02.557 --> 1:00:04.767
This was hack in the '90s, this joke.

1:00:04.851 --> 1:00:07.437
It's come back with a vengeance
on the stand-up circuit.

1:00:07.520 --> 1:00:09.606
It's like, "Well, like,
I identify as a cactus."

1:00:09.689 --> 1:00:14.152
Or, "I identify as a lamp post,"
or this inanimate object.

1:00:14.235 --> 1:00:15.111
And it's like…

1:00:15.737 --> 1:00:17.822
Um, yeah, I'm non-binary,

1:00:17.905 --> 1:00:20.199
which is under
the banner of trans identity.

1:00:20.283 --> 1:00:22.452
In that like the sex
I was assigned at birth

1:00:22.535 --> 1:00:24.662
doesn't feel like it fit.

1:00:24.746 --> 1:00:25.955
[giggles awkwardly] Um…

1:00:26.039 --> 1:00:26.998
And, uh…

1:00:27.540 --> 1:00:31.878
But it's like, I don't want to necessarily
identify as non-binary or trans,

1:00:31.961 --> 1:00:35.340
I just am that, I just am.
And to say otherwise would be bizarre.

1:00:35.423 --> 1:00:37.342
It would be like doing
a violence to myself.

1:00:37.425 --> 1:00:38.801
That's what it would feel like.

1:00:38.885 --> 1:00:41.095
It would be like
the hot tomato soup thing,

1:00:41.179 --> 1:00:43.556
times a hundred, just full of tomato soup.

1:00:43.640 --> 1:00:45.475
It's tricky because it's like…

1:00:46.100 --> 1:00:48.895
You just have to take my word for it
that I know who I am.

1:00:48.978 --> 1:00:51.397
It's so hard saying that to people.
It's like, I just…

1:00:51.481 --> 1:00:53.358
You just have to take my word for it.

1:00:53.441 --> 1:00:55.401
I am certain of it. And it's like…

1:00:55.485 --> 1:00:59.822
I may not be certain
if a Toyota Tercel can fit under a moose.

1:01:00.948 --> 1:01:02.325
Very unsure.

1:01:03.701 --> 1:01:05.203
But I do know this.

1:01:05.286 --> 1:01:08.915
Also, you don't have
to understand it even.

1:01:08.998 --> 1:01:12.126
You know what I mean?
Like, I do not understand Wi-Fi.

1:01:12.210 --> 1:01:13.544
How does it work? What is it?

1:01:13.628 --> 1:01:16.756
But I know that it's real.
I know it exists among us.

1:01:17.256 --> 1:01:20.301
-I just accept that it's there, whatever.
-[crowd cheering]

1:01:20.385 --> 1:01:22.470
I don't let it keep me up at night.

1:01:23.971 --> 1:01:24.972
I'm not like…

1:01:25.556 --> 1:01:26.557
Yeah. Um…

1:01:27.892 --> 1:01:30.687
Yeah, so I had top surgery last December

1:01:30.770 --> 1:01:35.400
and I'm on a low dose
of testosterone for this past year.

1:01:35.483 --> 1:01:38.861
And it's been
the best year of my life. Genuinely.

1:01:38.945 --> 1:01:41.614
And I'm 35 years old.
This has been the best year of my life.

1:01:41.698 --> 1:01:42.782
-Yeah.
-[crowd cheering]

1:01:42.865 --> 1:01:43.783
Thanks. Um…

1:01:44.951 --> 1:01:46.202
And it's like…

1:01:48.121 --> 1:01:50.915
What's weird is, like, I'm not that happy.

1:01:50.998 --> 1:01:55.044
I'm not skipping around.
It's truly just the absence of agony.

1:01:55.128 --> 1:01:56.254
That's all it is.

1:01:56.337 --> 1:02:00.258
And that's a low bar,
and who are we to deny anybody that?

1:02:00.341 --> 1:02:01.801
The absence of agony, yeah.

1:02:01.884 --> 1:02:05.179
That's going to be my… [laughs]
That's going to be my album title.

1:02:06.556 --> 1:02:07.432
Um…

1:02:08.307 --> 1:02:09.434
Yeah, okay.

1:02:09.976 --> 1:02:16.190
And also, I'm really just so grateful
to have the language now. Right?

1:02:16.274 --> 1:02:18.818
Growing up I didn't have that language.

1:02:18.901 --> 1:02:21.404
But I always felt this way
and I remember being…

1:02:21.487 --> 1:02:24.907
You know when you're four or five and
your parents tell the story of your birth?

1:02:24.991 --> 1:02:25.950
You know? And…

1:02:26.033 --> 1:02:27.618
I feel like my parents…

1:02:27.702 --> 1:02:31.414
It sounds like they were always
talking about my conception and my birth.

1:02:31.497 --> 1:02:33.958
I swear we had
normal conversations as well.

1:02:34.041 --> 1:02:36.377
But I remember my dad telling me,

1:02:36.461 --> 1:02:39.464
"Your mother went into labor,
we went to the hospital."

1:02:39.547 --> 1:02:42.049
He was saying,
"Maybe you'll have your own kids one day."

1:02:42.133 --> 1:02:43.843
And I'm imagining having my own kids.

1:02:43.926 --> 1:02:48.598
In my fantasy of having children,
I was never the one having the kids.

1:02:49.098 --> 1:02:54.312
It was a really specific fantasy where
I was this 1950s businessman father,

1:02:54.395 --> 1:02:57.231
just like pacing
the halls of the hospital.

1:02:57.315 --> 1:02:58.524
Smoking. Just…

1:02:59.233 --> 1:03:01.486
Really like a very <i>101 Dalmatians </i>vibe.

1:03:01.569 --> 1:03:03.863
Then some nurse
would be like, "It's a boy."

1:03:03.946 --> 1:03:05.740
And I'd be like, "Cheers, gentlemen."

1:03:07.408 --> 1:03:08.951
"I'll name it Buster."

1:03:10.161 --> 1:03:11.829
"Send it down the mines."

1:03:12.830 --> 1:03:15.333
Um, yeah. Okay, we're almost at the end.

1:03:15.416 --> 1:03:18.419
I have one more thing to tell you.
I'm gonna get my mic stand.

1:03:18.503 --> 1:03:21.005
If I… Yeah, imagine if I lost it?

1:03:22.965 --> 1:03:26.677
So, I feel like… And by the way,
thank you so much. This has been really…

1:03:26.761 --> 1:03:28.513
You've been amazing.

1:03:28.596 --> 1:03:30.473
[crowd cheering]

1:03:32.600 --> 1:03:35.102
I feel like we've been through, like…

1:03:35.186 --> 1:03:38.940
In terms of our worldview,
we've been through pessimism and optimism.

1:03:39.023 --> 1:03:40.983
And I really want
to end on a positive note.

1:03:41.067 --> 1:03:44.487
So I want to tell you
this Buddhist parable that I love.

1:03:44.570 --> 1:03:46.781
Um, this is… Stay with me. So…

1:03:47.573 --> 1:03:49.700
I love this story. Um…

1:03:49.784 --> 1:03:51.118
And then I'm gonna go.

1:03:51.202 --> 1:03:54.330
It takes place in the forest, actually.
We're back in the forest.

1:03:54.413 --> 1:03:58.334
And, basically, in this parable,
this man is being chased,

1:03:58.417 --> 1:04:00.586
pursued through the forest by

1:04:00.670 --> 1:04:03.506
what I can only describe
as a beast from hell.

1:04:03.589 --> 1:04:06.092
Like, a really terrifying creature

1:04:06.175 --> 1:04:09.929
with a lion's jaws
and this monstrous body.

1:04:10.012 --> 1:04:12.890
Its nature is pure hunger.
It wants to devour this man,

1:04:12.974 --> 1:04:16.018
and it's been chasing him for days,
and he's been running.

1:04:16.102 --> 1:04:18.062
And he's starting to get exhausted.

1:04:18.145 --> 1:04:20.565
At some point, he's going
to succumb to the beast.

1:04:20.648 --> 1:04:24.318
Just when he thinks he's gonna pass out
and the beast is gonna get him,

1:04:24.402 --> 1:04:27.780
he sees this little stone well
in the middle of the forest,

1:04:27.864 --> 1:04:28.906
little circular well.

1:04:28.990 --> 1:04:31.325
He's like, "I'll hide
in the well from the beast."

1:04:31.409 --> 1:04:34.036
He jumps in.
Sure enough, the beast doesn't follow him

1:04:34.120 --> 1:04:36.080
It stops at the top and is like… [growls]

1:04:36.163 --> 1:04:39.709
He's like, "Great." He's falling
down the well, and as he's falling,

1:04:39.792 --> 1:04:43.212
he feels water splashing up onto his feet.

1:04:43.296 --> 1:04:45.590
He's like, "That's weird."
And he looks down.

1:04:46.090 --> 1:04:48.301
And below him, where he's headed,

1:04:48.384 --> 1:04:51.387
the water is churning wildly,
and he realizes…

1:04:51.470 --> 1:04:53.014
What's at the bottom of the well?

1:04:53.598 --> 1:04:54.515
Another beast.

1:04:54.599 --> 1:04:56.893
Yeah. It's a double beast situash.

1:04:57.560 --> 1:04:59.562
Bad. Bad news.

1:04:59.645 --> 1:05:01.230
Beast at the top, beast below.

1:05:02.148 --> 1:05:03.816
[growls] Like that.

1:05:03.900 --> 1:05:06.944
And, at the last second,
he sees this branch

1:05:07.028 --> 1:05:09.530
growing out of the side of the well,
like a gnarly branch.

1:05:09.614 --> 1:05:13.409
So he grabs onto it
and he uses his last remaining strength

1:05:13.492 --> 1:05:16.287
to maneuver himself up onto this branch.

1:05:16.370 --> 1:05:18.581
And his muscles are quivering.

1:05:18.664 --> 1:05:21.250
But he's like, "I made it."
The beast is there, the beast below.

1:05:21.334 --> 1:05:24.295
And the branch is creaking
under his weight,

1:05:24.378 --> 1:05:27.006
like, this is not
a permanent solution. Right?

1:05:27.089 --> 1:05:29.800
At some point,
the branch is going to give out.

1:05:29.884 --> 1:05:31.385
And he's sweating…

1:05:31.469 --> 1:05:33.638
he's sweating
in that crease here. You know?

1:05:35.056 --> 1:05:38.684
If you're sweating in that crease,
you are in trouble.

1:05:39.977 --> 1:05:43.439
And suddenly he looks to the end
of the branch and he sees

1:05:43.522 --> 1:05:45.650
something glistening on the end.

1:05:45.733 --> 1:05:48.110
He's like, "What is that?"
And so he balances

1:05:48.194 --> 1:05:51.364
and he reaches out with one finger
to the end of the branch,

1:05:51.447 --> 1:05:52.740
and he gets it on his finger.

1:05:52.823 --> 1:05:55.368
It's golden, glistening tree sap.

1:05:55.451 --> 1:05:56.369
It's tree sap.

1:05:56.452 --> 1:05:58.996
And he puts it in his mouth and he's like,

1:05:59.789 --> 1:06:01.582
"Is that? That's delicious."

1:06:04.251 --> 1:06:06.754
Guys, it's positive. Wait.

1:06:07.296 --> 1:06:09.298
That's… That's it. No.

1:06:11.217 --> 1:06:12.385
Hello? [laughs]

1:06:13.970 --> 1:06:14.804
Okay.

1:06:18.182 --> 1:06:19.225
Okay. Uh…

1:06:20.643 --> 1:06:23.312
Trust me, I find it very positive.

1:06:24.021 --> 1:06:26.816
You got to get on board. Please.
I've called the show <i>SAP.</i>

1:06:26.899 --> 1:06:29.193
You truly must get on board.

1:06:29.276 --> 1:06:32.655
Like, this was not cheap.

1:06:32.738 --> 1:06:34.865
[crowd cheering]

1:06:35.992 --> 1:06:39.245
No, but I really do find it positive
because it's, like, look.

1:06:39.328 --> 1:06:42.540
Life might be a double beast situash.

1:06:42.623 --> 1:06:46.335
That might be just what life--
In a way, is it not? Know what I mean?

1:06:46.419 --> 1:06:48.212
But luckily there's so much sap,

1:06:48.295 --> 1:06:52.258
and we have to just to take the time,
it's worth it to enjoy the sap,

1:06:52.341 --> 1:06:54.176
and cultivate it where we can.

1:06:54.260 --> 1:06:57.096
And luckily there's
an abundance of sap, I think.

1:06:57.179 --> 1:06:59.890
Like everywhere you look,
if you look hard.

1:06:59.974 --> 1:07:01.434
You got dogs.

1:07:03.644 --> 1:07:06.397
Every dog on this Earth.

1:07:06.897 --> 1:07:09.859
Like a good pair of jeans.
That's sap. That can be sap.

1:07:09.942 --> 1:07:12.194
The Beatles, for me, are sap. Um…

1:07:12.820 --> 1:07:16.824
Your friends. The TV show <i>Friends.</i>
No, like having friends.

1:07:16.907 --> 1:07:18.242
Um, sex is good.

1:07:18.325 --> 1:07:20.661
Sex with your friends is pretty good. Um…

1:07:21.495 --> 1:07:23.789
Scaring people, "Ooh." Yeah, if that's…

1:07:25.708 --> 1:07:28.794
I like campfires, roasting marshmallows,

1:07:28.878 --> 1:07:31.255
the song "Bennie and the Jets"
by Elton John.

1:07:32.548 --> 1:07:33.382
Um…

1:07:33.466 --> 1:07:37.595
Yeah, hugs and sparklers,
Christmas lights,

1:07:37.678 --> 1:07:39.847
all those things are fully sap.

1:07:39.930 --> 1:07:41.807
All those things can be sap.

1:07:41.891 --> 1:07:43.976
And genuinely, this may be corny,

1:07:44.060 --> 1:07:46.395
but truly, this is sap for me.

1:07:46.479 --> 1:07:50.357
Doing this makes me so happy
and it's sap for me.

1:07:50.441 --> 1:07:52.526
And I'm so grateful to you all for coming.

1:07:52.610 --> 1:07:53.903
[crowd cheering]

1:07:53.986 --> 1:07:55.112
Thank you so much.

1:07:56.822 --> 1:07:59.450
[continue cheering]

1:08:10.086 --> 1:08:12.088
[continue cheering]

1:08:14.840 --> 1:08:16.258
[man clapping]

1:08:16.342 --> 1:08:19.261
Thank you so much. Thank you very much.

1:08:21.597 --> 1:08:22.556
Oh, fuck.

1:08:23.390 --> 1:08:24.475
[sniffles]

1:08:24.558 --> 1:08:27.311
[sobbing] Oh my God. Oh my God.

1:08:27.394 --> 1:08:29.605
Are-- Wait. Are you crying?

1:08:30.564 --> 1:08:32.858
Yeah, I mean, it was all just so sad.

1:08:32.942 --> 1:08:34.485
[sobbing]

1:08:34.568 --> 1:08:36.112
It was supposed to be funny.

1:08:36.195 --> 1:08:39.990
-No, it wasn't.
<i>-</i>Yeah, it was. The whole thing.

1:08:40.741 --> 1:08:41.951
Really?

1:08:43.285 --> 1:08:44.328
[sighs]

1:08:45.371 --> 1:08:47.540
Guess you and I just have
different senses of humor.

1:08:48.374 --> 1:08:50.501
Well, thank you
for listening anyway. [sniffs]

1:08:51.085 --> 1:08:53.212
It's good to get that stuff off my chest.

1:08:56.340 --> 1:08:57.925
No, it's…

1:08:59.135 --> 1:09:01.262
It's me. I'm me.

1:09:04.348 --> 1:09:05.349
You are you.

1:09:06.142 --> 1:09:07.268
It's wonderful.

1:09:10.521 --> 1:09:13.274
-Well, should we get started?
-Yeah.

1:09:13.357 --> 1:09:15.234
-[grunts]
-[Mae sighs]

1:09:15.317 --> 1:09:18.154
-Are you excited?
-Yeah, I'm a little nervous. I'm excited.

1:09:18.237 --> 1:09:19.738
Nervous is normal. This is a bit heavy.

1:09:19.822 --> 1:09:21.699
The Buchanan's got
a lot of mail this season.

1:09:21.782 --> 1:09:23.868
-Oh, really? Popular?
-You're gonna love this.

1:09:23.951 --> 1:09:25.327
-Okay.
-All right. Shovels.

1:09:25.411 --> 1:09:26.829
-Yeah.
-Yeah? Ooh.

1:09:26.912 --> 1:09:28.581
-[both laugh]
-[pensive music playing]

1:09:28.664 --> 1:09:31.125
-I'm so happy you came.
-[Mae] Yeah, thanks for having me.

1:09:31.208 --> 1:09:33.210
I can't believe
it was supposed to be funny.

1:09:33.294 --> 1:09:34.503
-Yeah, well…
-That's crazy.

1:09:34.587 --> 1:09:36.589
Parts were poignant, I guess. But…

1:09:36.672 --> 1:09:38.632
-Yeah. All right, so here we go.
-Okay.

1:09:38.716 --> 1:09:42.261
Let's get a little hole going here.
There you go. Get in there.

1:09:42.344 --> 1:09:43.554
You're gonna love this, Mae.

1:09:43.637 --> 1:09:45.097
-Over-the-shoulder?
-Oh, yeah.

1:09:45.181 --> 1:09:48.058
-Yeah, ready.
-One, two, three. Yeah!

1:09:48.142 --> 1:09:50.436
-Feels good, huh?
-[Mae laughs] Sick. Should we…?

1:09:50.519 --> 1:09:52.354
-[man] Yeah, grab some mail.
-What do you…

1:09:53.105 --> 1:09:55.149
What do you usually? Is this one fine?

1:09:55.232 --> 1:09:57.234
[both continue indistinctly]
