00:01.330 --> 00:03.459
Previously
on "For the People"...

00:03.460 --> 00:04.999
You said something to me once.

00:05.000 --> 00:06.379
You said, "You don't celebrate
people going to jail."

00:06.380 --> 00:07.959
I don't think I fully
understood that until now.

00:07.960 --> 00:09.379
I turned on a client.

00:09.380 --> 00:11.789
You tried to save
someone's life.

00:11.790 --> 00:13.499
I'm the person
who never turns on you.

00:13.500 --> 00:15.210
I was not that today.

00:16.379 --> 00:17.749
- Roger!
- Get on the ground now!

00:17.750 --> 00:18.500
Don't move!

00:18.501 --> 00:20.919
Hey. Hey.

00:20.920 --> 00:22.250
Come on.

00:24.000 --> 00:30.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:01.250 --> 01:03.999
You're my attorney? Really? Yes.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.419
I wouldn't have
picked that belt,

01:05.420 --> 01:07.379
but you are absolutely
pulling it off.

01:07.380 --> 01:09.119
Thank you.

01:09.120 --> 01:11.329
Obsessed with "Project Runway."

01:11.330 --> 01:13.209
I worship at the feet
of Nina Garcia.

01:13.210 --> 01:14.210
She's the best. Yeah.

01:14.211 --> 01:15.879
Posen? He can kick rocks.

01:15.880 --> 01:17.579
So many rocks.

01:17.580 --> 01:19.209
But I'd take
an outfit designed by him

01:19.210 --> 01:20.379
over this awful thing.

01:20.380 --> 01:22.210
It's humiliating.
It doesn't even fit.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.419
Cigarettes. Cigarettes.

01:26.420 --> 01:28.039
Things are gonna kill me,
and I don't even smoke.

01:28.040 --> 01:29.959
They're not going
to kill you, Rodney.

01:29.960 --> 01:31.459
I figured they'd just
tell me to pack up.

01:31.460 --> 01:33.579
Isn't that what they do?
They do. Usually.

01:33.580 --> 01:35.669
But you were allegedly
selling a big quantity.

01:35.670 --> 01:37.379
And they traced the cartons
back to a shipment

01:37.380 --> 01:39.459
that came illegally from China.
China?

01:39.460 --> 01:41.499
These came off a truck
on Junction Boulevard.

01:41.500 --> 01:43.169
I buy what I buy.
Sell what I can.

01:43.170 --> 01:44.459
Who am I hurting?

01:44.460 --> 01:46.209
People out there
sell drugs, guns.

01:46.210 --> 01:47.879
I've never done anything
like that.

01:47.880 --> 01:48.830
Never been arrested.

01:48.831 --> 01:49.959
I know it's scary.

01:49.960 --> 01:51.789
You have no idea.

01:51.790 --> 01:52.710
I have a daughter.

01:52.711 --> 01:54.249
How old?

01:54.250 --> 01:55.829
She's 4.

01:55.830 --> 01:56.879
Her name's Sky.

01:56.880 --> 01:58.539
Beautiful name.

01:58.540 --> 01:59.959
Beautiful girl.

01:59.960 --> 02:01.669
I always wanted her to know
there was more out there

02:01.670 --> 02:03.999
than East Baltimore.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.789
No limits.

02:05.790 --> 02:07.290
Nobody ever told me that.

02:08.500 --> 02:10.038
You look so familiar.

02:10.039 --> 02:11.750
I was actually thinking
the same thing.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.879
But whatever. We're here now.

02:14.880 --> 02:16.959
Everything happens
for a reason, right?

02:16.960 --> 02:19.119
This is gonna work out.
I have to believe that.

02:19.120 --> 02:20.379
You should believe that.

02:20.380 --> 02:21.999
We are going to
work this out. Okay?

02:22.000 --> 02:23.169
You should be released

02:23.170 --> 02:24.669
after your bail hearing
this afternoon.

02:24.670 --> 02:26.829
Is there anything I can do
for you before then?

02:26.830 --> 02:28.920
Just get me out of here.

02:30.120 --> 02:31.999
Cigarettes? Cigarettes.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.419
NYPD is cracking down.
On cigarettes?

02:34.420 --> 02:36.329
Shouldn't they be, like,
cracking down on crime?

02:36.330 --> 02:38.169
I feel like that's
totally reasonable.

02:38.170 --> 02:40.119
Jay. Duty.

02:40.120 --> 02:43.959
And I feel like that's
totally un... derstandable.

02:43.960 --> 02:45.539
Because I had duty yesterday

02:45.540 --> 02:47.999
and the day before that,
so why not today?

02:48.000 --> 02:49.539
Duty calls. Call of Duty.

02:49.540 --> 02:50.789
Tour of Duty.

02:50.790 --> 02:52.250
Reporting for duty,
General Carlan.

02:54.330 --> 02:56.119
I'm just gonna head over
to the courthouse.

02:56.120 --> 02:57.709
He could do five years for this.

02:57.710 --> 02:58.710
For cigarettes.

02:58.711 --> 03:00.329
He could do five years

03:00.330 --> 03:02.209
if he went to trial
and was convicted.

03:02.210 --> 03:03.539
But that's not gonna happen.

03:03.540 --> 03:04.959
Talk to the line prosecutor.

03:04.960 --> 03:08.080
They're not taking untaxed
cigarettes to a jury.

03:14.670 --> 03:16.119
Jury duty? Yes.

03:16.120 --> 03:17.169
You? Yes.

03:17.170 --> 03:18.749
On jury duty? Yes.

03:18.750 --> 03:20.669
With jurors?

03:20.670 --> 03:23.079
I think that's the way it works,
even in state court.

03:23.080 --> 03:24.829
They're never gonna pick you.
I hope they do.

03:24.830 --> 03:26.459
Never served on a jury before.

03:26.460 --> 03:28.119
There's a reason for that.
You're a judge.

03:28.120 --> 03:29.789
I'm a person. Yeah, not really.

03:29.790 --> 03:31.459
I pack a lunch.
Someone packs it for you.

03:31.460 --> 03:32.789
In a brown paper bag.

03:32.790 --> 03:35.749
And what does it say on that bag?
Nothing.

03:35.750 --> 03:39.119
Does it say "World's Greatest
Eddie Punchclock" on that bag?

03:39.120 --> 03:40.170
Maybe.

03:41.670 --> 03:44.329
Anyway, it's state court.
And I'm looking forward to it.

03:44.330 --> 03:46.209
To see
the criminal justice system

03:46.210 --> 03:48.960
from a completely
different perspective.

03:53.380 --> 03:54.829
Sorry.

03:54.830 --> 03:56.669
Welcome to jury duty.
Good morning!

03:56.670 --> 03:57.999
Morning.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.579
Let's try that again.
Good morning!

03:59.580 --> 04:00.619
Good morning!!

04:00.620 --> 04:02.379
Much better. Good morning.

04:02.380 --> 04:04.379
My name's Ms. Ryan,
and I'm here to answer

04:04.380 --> 04:06.119
any questions you have
except one,

04:06.120 --> 04:07.579
which is when can I go home?

04:07.580 --> 04:09.249
The answer is 500. 500.

04:09.250 --> 04:11.419
Not a minute before. Do not ask.

04:11.420 --> 04:12.669
Now... What time are
we out of here?

04:12.670 --> 04:13.879
500.

04:13.880 --> 04:15.079
Thank you for asking.

04:15.080 --> 04:16.168
A few other things
before we get...

04:16.170 --> 04:17.879
Is it cool if I bounce at 430?

04:17.880 --> 04:21.249
500. Now, a few other things
before we get started.

04:21.250 --> 04:23.499
There's no eating or drinking
in the courtrooms.

04:23.500 --> 04:25.329
No pets. No weapons.
No chewing gum.

04:25.330 --> 04:27.209
No photography.
No hope. No exit.

04:27.210 --> 04:28.499
That's a joke.

04:28.500 --> 04:30.579
There is an exit
right behind you to the left.

04:30.580 --> 04:32.669
In a few minutes, some of you
will be assigned a courtroom.

04:32.670 --> 04:33.620
Please be patient.

04:33.621 --> 04:35.079
In the meantime,

04:35.080 --> 04:36.579
please direct your attention
to our monitors

04:36.580 --> 04:37.669
on which you will now see

04:37.670 --> 04:39.539
an advanced screening of
"Wonder Woman."

04:39.540 --> 04:42.169
You have been summoned
for jury service.

04:42.170 --> 04:44.419
Now is also the time to
put away your phones.

04:44.420 --> 04:45.879
Thank you. Thank you, all.

04:45.880 --> 04:47.419
It's been a real pleasure.

04:47.420 --> 04:48.709
Without the participation
of citizens like you.

04:48.710 --> 04:50.959
I did buy shampoo.

04:50.960 --> 04:52.959
Look under the sink...

04:52.960 --> 04:56.539
Under the sink... under.

04:56.540 --> 04:58.119
Under.

04:58.120 --> 05:00.119
Did you look under the sink?

05:00.120 --> 05:02.209
The sink... under the sink.
Excuse me.

05:02.210 --> 05:04.209
Yeah? She said to put
away our phones.

05:04.210 --> 05:05.210
Okay, gramps, got it.

05:06.710 --> 05:08.419
Did you look under the sink?

05:08.420 --> 05:09.709
No, the sink.

05:09.710 --> 05:11.040
Under the sink...

05:12.960 --> 05:15.079
Is it true?
Yes, he's on jury duty.

05:15.080 --> 05:16.329
Who? Judge Byrne.

05:16.330 --> 05:17.749
No, I wasn't asking about that.

05:17.750 --> 05:19.459
Really? Judge Byrne?

05:19.460 --> 05:21.579
In state court. Is what true?

05:21.580 --> 05:23.879
The rumor about
a softer, gentler,

05:23.880 --> 05:25.419
more reasonable Leonard Knox?

05:25.420 --> 05:27.249
Who said that? It's a rumor.

05:27.250 --> 05:28.379
It's not anyone in particular.

05:28.380 --> 05:29.619
You just hear it.

05:29.620 --> 05:30.999
Sandra.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.209
I subpoenaed her to turn over

05:32.210 --> 05:34.459
confidential information
from her client.

05:34.460 --> 05:36.079
I don't think she thinks
I'm softer or gentler.

05:36.080 --> 05:38.039
It might have been before that.

05:38.040 --> 05:39.879
You're here about
Rodney Jenkins?

05:39.880 --> 05:41.919
Yes. Make your pitch.

05:41.920 --> 05:44.789
Rodney has no priors.
This is a non-violent crime.

05:44.790 --> 05:47.169
He's being charged as if he runs
an illegal tobacco ring

05:47.170 --> 05:48.919
when in fact he's just
selling on the street.

05:48.920 --> 05:50.879
He should be released on
his own recognizance.

05:50.880 --> 05:52.169
It's a beautiful day.

05:52.170 --> 05:54.209
I walked to work. I never walk.

05:54.210 --> 05:55.959
New York is glorious
this time of year.

05:55.960 --> 05:58.919
I took the train.

05:58.920 --> 06:01.079
The subway is an amazing place.

06:01.080 --> 06:04.039
One of the last places on Earth
where there is no hierarchy.

06:04.040 --> 06:05.579
Everyone is on equal footing.

06:05.580 --> 06:06.959
Rodney's hearing
is in 15 minutes.

06:06.960 --> 06:08.250
Walk to the courthouse together?

06:09.830 --> 06:11.789
The rumor. Is it true?

06:11.790 --> 06:13.039
You haven't answered
my question.

06:13.040 --> 06:14.040
Are you sure?

06:15.460 --> 06:16.999
Your Honor,
Mr. Jenkins is being charged

06:17.000 --> 06:18.749
with the illegal sale
of untaxed cigarettes

06:18.750 --> 06:21.499
in violation of.

06:21.500 --> 06:22.999
In light of the nature
of the offense,

06:23.000 --> 06:24.459
and Mr. Jenkins' lack
of criminal history,

06:24.460 --> 06:25.749
we would ask that
Mr. Jenkins be released

06:25.750 --> 06:27.079
on his own recognizance.

06:27.080 --> 06:28.500
No bail at all? No, Your Honor.

06:31.580 --> 06:34.459
Defendant moved here
from Baltimore six months ago?

06:34.460 --> 06:36.289
That is correct, Your Honor.
To take care of his grandmother.

06:36.290 --> 06:37.709
Do you have children,
Mr. Jenkins?

06:37.710 --> 06:38.919
He does, Your Honor. A daughter.

06:38.920 --> 06:40.289
Her name is Sky.

06:40.290 --> 06:42.119
Sky? Okay. You supporting her?

06:42.120 --> 06:43.459
He does his best, Your Honor.

06:43.460 --> 06:45.419
Well, obviously his best
isn't good enough.

06:45.420 --> 06:46.789
His baby lives in Baltimore.

06:46.790 --> 06:48.919
Yes. Sky...
That wasn't a question.

06:48.920 --> 06:51.169
Mr. Knox, despite the fact
that the defendant

06:51.170 --> 06:52.459
has a daughter living
in another state,

06:52.460 --> 06:54.250
you do not consider him
to be a flight risk?

06:56.290 --> 06:58.289
I do not.

06:58.290 --> 07:00.249
Well, I respectfully disagree.

07:00.250 --> 07:02.249
Even bad fathers want to
see their daughters...

07:02.250 --> 07:04.379
Your Honor, I strongly object
to the insinuation

07:04.380 --> 07:05.879
that Mr. Jenkins is a bad father

07:05.880 --> 07:07.289
because he doesn't live
with his...

07:07.290 --> 07:09.169
He's a bad father because
he's in custody in New York

07:09.170 --> 07:10.379
and his daughter
is in Baltimore.

07:10.380 --> 07:11.959
Given that he's facing
five years in prison

07:11.960 --> 07:13.289
for a first offense,

07:13.290 --> 07:15.170
I would like to persuade him
to appear in court.

07:16.080 --> 07:18.040
I'll set bond at $100,000.

07:19.330 --> 07:20.620
You can call the next case.

07:33.960 --> 07:35.579
100 grand? Cool.

07:35.580 --> 07:37.039
I'll liquidate my 401
and sell my yacht.

07:37.040 --> 07:38.539
It's a personal
recognizance bond.

07:38.540 --> 07:40.379
Not cash bail.
I don't get the difference.

07:40.380 --> 07:41.579
It means you don't have
to put up money.

07:41.580 --> 07:43.379
You just need
three people with means

07:43.380 --> 07:45.499
or at least moral suasion
to sign... Moral, what?

07:45.500 --> 07:47.669
Three people close to you
need to sign the bond

07:47.670 --> 07:49.829
saying they're responsible
for you showing up to court.

07:49.830 --> 07:51.289
What about Sky's mother?

07:51.290 --> 07:52.459
I don't want her
to know about this.

07:52.460 --> 07:54.619
She'll use it against me.
Anyone else?

07:54.620 --> 07:56.329
I came up there to take care
of my grandma in Harlem.

07:56.330 --> 07:58.249
Anna. She'll have my back.

07:58.250 --> 08:00.419
My cousin, Gerald,
he stays up here, too.

08:00.420 --> 08:02.579
I have a half-brother
in Astoria...

08:02.580 --> 08:04.579
We don't talk much but
I sent him money last summer

08:04.580 --> 08:06.039
when he was in a bind.

08:06.040 --> 08:07.539
But that's all
the family I've got.

08:07.540 --> 08:08.919
Well, let's start there.

08:08.920 --> 08:09.880
How long will all of this take?

08:09.881 --> 08:11.669
A few days.

08:11.670 --> 08:13.209
They served turkey last night.

08:13.210 --> 08:14.379
I'm not going to ask
how that was.

08:14.380 --> 08:15.539
With gravy.

08:15.540 --> 08:17.119
I'm sorry. First time I ate.

08:17.120 --> 08:19.289
It was actually pretty good.

08:19.290 --> 08:21.000
Hang in there. Okay?

08:26.880 --> 08:29.040
You okay?

08:30.500 --> 08:32.078
Yeah, I'm fine.

08:32.080 --> 08:33.708
You have enough to do?

08:33.710 --> 08:36.789
Or too much?

08:36.789 --> 08:38.578
I'm fine. Really.

08:38.580 --> 08:39.789
Sandra.

08:41.710 --> 08:43.208
Take as much time as you need

08:43.210 --> 08:45.119
to get back to full speed, okay?

08:45.120 --> 08:47.079
You made one of the most
difficult calls

08:47.080 --> 08:48.959
I've seen in my career.

08:48.960 --> 08:50.619
There isn't a lawyer
in this office

08:50.620 --> 08:52.499
who doesn't respect
what you did.

08:52.500 --> 08:55.249
What you went through.

08:55.250 --> 08:58.419
And I know they feel
the same way across the street.

08:58.420 --> 08:59.999
They subpoenaed me.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.959
That was awful. I agree.

09:01.960 --> 09:04.039
And I told Roger that personally

09:04.040 --> 09:06.619
in the strongest possible terms.

09:06.620 --> 09:10.459
Well, thank you for raising it
with him personally.

09:10.460 --> 09:13.039
I know you two have
a good relationship,

09:13.040 --> 09:15.210
so I'm sure that wasn't easy.

09:38.540 --> 09:40.959
I want your help with something.

09:40.960 --> 09:42.789
Okay!
Let's get this party started.

09:42.790 --> 09:45.289
What do you say we kick this off
with a little voir dire?

09:45.290 --> 09:47.119
Voir dire originally
referred to an oath

09:47.120 --> 09:48.499
taken by jurors
to tell the truth.

09:48.500 --> 09:49.670
Shut it.

09:51.580 --> 09:53.879
Counsel, please proceed.

09:53.880 --> 09:56.209
Juror Number 12,
is there any reason

09:56.210 --> 09:57.579
you couldn't be impartial

09:57.580 --> 09:59.999
in a case involving
one parent assaulting another

10:00.000 --> 10:01.419
at their children's
sporting event?

10:01.420 --> 10:02.669
I have nine children.

10:02.670 --> 10:04.289
Does that mean
you can't be impartial?

10:04.290 --> 10:05.879
It means I hate children.

10:05.880 --> 10:07.459
I'm a full-time college student.

10:07.460 --> 10:09.379
University of Central Delaware.

10:09.380 --> 10:10.459
It's online.

10:10.460 --> 10:11.879
What year are you? I'm 22.

10:11.880 --> 10:13.169
What year are you in college?

10:13.170 --> 10:15.709
I'm 22 there, too. I'm 22.

10:15.710 --> 10:18.379
I'm a small-business owner.
A hair salon.

10:18.380 --> 10:21.169
And when I say small,
I'm saying it's just me.

10:21.170 --> 10:22.709
Your shop is closed right now?

10:22.710 --> 10:24.249
Could you repeat the question?

10:24.250 --> 10:26.499
I'm the chief judge for the
United States District Court

10:26.500 --> 10:28.209
for the Southern District
of New York.

10:28.210 --> 10:30.789
Are you or is any member of your
immediate family an attorney?

10:30.790 --> 10:32.619
Yes, I'm the chief judge...

10:32.620 --> 10:34.499
And do you or any of your
immediate family members

10:34.500 --> 10:36.419
have any relationships in
the criminal justice system

10:36.420 --> 10:37.919
that you believe could
potentially interfere

10:37.920 --> 10:40.119
with your ability to serve
as a juror in this case?

10:40.120 --> 10:41.669
Yes. Absolutely. Thank you.

10:41.670 --> 10:43.079
We're good, Your Honor.

10:43.080 --> 10:45.379
Terrific. We have our jury.

10:45.380 --> 10:46.620
Congratulations.

10:53.580 --> 10:56.079
Good news. I got you two
signatures on Rodney's bond.

10:56.080 --> 10:57.879
Cousin Gerald and Brother Eric.

10:57.880 --> 11:00.919
Side note... Brother Eric
is actually Brother Eric...

11:00.920 --> 11:02.249
He joined the Nation of Islam
this week.

11:02.250 --> 11:03.619
I just thought that was funny.

11:03.620 --> 11:06.119
Bad news? Neither is
a great candidate.

11:06.120 --> 11:07.959
Gerald is in every kind of debt
you can name.

11:07.960 --> 11:09.579
Don't try. It's true.
All of them.

11:09.580 --> 11:12.289
And Eric.
Excuse me, Brother Eric...

11:12.290 --> 11:15.039
The only thing he owns is every
live Prince recording ever made.

11:15.040 --> 11:16.539
Dope, but not worth much.

11:16.540 --> 11:18.539
So, even if we get
a third co-signer...

11:18.540 --> 11:20.289
Leonard might not approve
the bond application.

11:20.290 --> 11:21.419
You want to hear the good news?

11:21.420 --> 11:23.289
One, Leonard Knox
is being reasonable.

11:23.290 --> 11:24.879
Maybe Mercury is in retrograde.

11:24.880 --> 11:26.579
Whatever it is, he's cool.

11:26.580 --> 11:28.959
Second, I looked into
Rodney's grandmother, Anna,

11:28.960 --> 11:30.579
and she's the dream co-signer.

11:30.580 --> 11:31.749
Deacon at her church...

11:31.750 --> 11:34.289
Owns her brownstone in Harlem
outright.

11:34.290 --> 11:35.710
Rodney says she'll support him.

11:39.380 --> 11:41.919
What did he do this time?
This time?

11:41.920 --> 11:43.919
He tell you he come up from
Baltimore to take care of me?

11:43.920 --> 11:45.379
Is that not true?

11:45.380 --> 11:47.459
His baby's mama told him
to get lost

11:47.460 --> 11:49.209
because he couldn't
hold down a job.

11:49.210 --> 11:51.039
He's been leaving here
every morning

11:51.040 --> 11:53.169
telling me he's going
on interviews.

11:53.170 --> 11:55.289
He'll fool you, honey...
Don't fall for it.

11:55.290 --> 11:56.379
He needs your help.

11:56.380 --> 11:57.619
I don't have any money.

11:57.620 --> 11:59.329
The judge isn't
asking for money.

11:59.330 --> 12:02.669
He's requiring three people
to sign a $100,000 bond

12:02.670 --> 12:05.169
saying they're responsible for
Rodney making his court date.

12:05.170 --> 12:07.999
What happens if he doesn't make
his court date? I promise...

12:08.000 --> 12:09.999
Honey, I don't care
what you're promising.

12:10.000 --> 12:13.459
I don't know you.
But I do know that boy.

12:13.460 --> 12:17.169
Now tell me what will happen
if he doesn't show.

12:17.170 --> 12:20.119
You would be responsible
for the money.

12:20.120 --> 12:22.919
$100,000. But that's only if...

12:22.920 --> 12:25.169
No. I will not do this.

12:25.170 --> 12:26.499
I don't have money.

12:26.500 --> 12:29.999
But what I have is this house.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.999
I bought it with
my husband in 1981

12:32.000 --> 12:33.959
and I own it free and clear.

12:33.960 --> 12:35.829
And I'm not risking that
for Rodney.

12:35.830 --> 12:37.079
Now, when he gets out,

12:37.080 --> 12:39.829
he'll have a place to stay
because he's family.

12:39.830 --> 12:42.419
But he made his bed,
he can lie in it.

12:42.420 --> 12:45.080
And you can tell him
I said that.

12:48.750 --> 12:50.619
Look, I'm sorry. Which
one didn't come through?

12:50.620 --> 12:51.920
Gerald or Eric?

12:59.670 --> 13:03.249
I don't blame her.
She's done a lot for me.

13:03.250 --> 13:05.710
I used to spend summers up here
with my parents...

13:08.540 --> 13:10.710
She'd tell me not to speak
ill of the dead.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.420
Tell her I'm sorry.

13:17.330 --> 13:18.830
I'm not mad at her, though.

13:21.330 --> 13:23.419
We need someone else
to sign the bond.

13:23.420 --> 13:26.999
Someone who can actually be
financially responsible.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.379
It can be a friend.

13:29.380 --> 13:32.419
You have friends who would risk
a hundred stacks for you?

13:32.420 --> 13:35.459
I think.

13:35.460 --> 13:37.579
I hope.

13:37.580 --> 13:39.080
That must be nice.

13:41.620 --> 13:45.209
It's so loud in here.

13:45.210 --> 13:47.879
Never knew that.
Nobody ever talks about that.

13:47.880 --> 13:51.170
I keep getting
this pain in my chest.

13:52.790 --> 13:53.999
Jason.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.709
Jason.

13:56.710 --> 13:58.459
We grew up together
in Baltimore.

13:58.460 --> 14:00.580
He works at the Harlem DMV.
Okay.

14:02.880 --> 14:05.829
It's a bar in Harlem.
That's confusing.

14:05.830 --> 14:08.709
He owns it, but I'd hate
to lean on him.

14:08.710 --> 14:11.120
Do you want to be in here
any longer than you have to?

14:15.290 --> 14:17.250
I'm going to talk to Jason.

14:19.250 --> 14:20.829
"Project Runway" is on tonight.

14:20.830 --> 14:21.830
Will you take notes for me?

14:21.831 --> 14:24.170
Yes. Of course.

14:28.500 --> 14:30.170
I don't want to go
back in there.

14:34.210 --> 14:35.959
Mrs. McHugh,
can you please tell us

14:35.960 --> 14:38.119
what you saw on
the baseball field that day?

14:38.120 --> 14:40.789
Well, I typically don't watch
much of the games.

14:40.790 --> 14:42.249
My son is terrible.

14:42.250 --> 14:45.209
He's very uncoordinated
and lazy, like his father...

14:45.210 --> 14:46.579
Mrs. McHugh... Yeah. Okay.

14:46.580 --> 14:47.959
Well, I heard some commotion,

14:47.960 --> 14:50.919
and when I looked up,
Carl French... that man there...

14:50.920 --> 14:52.379
Was charging across the field,

14:52.380 --> 14:54.789
screaming about
some laser pointer.

14:54.790 --> 14:57.169
But really? Carl was just upset
his son struck out

14:57.170 --> 14:59.039
and he was gonna
take it out on someone.

14:59.040 --> 15:00.959
I don't think he's ever
liked Mr. Orsua.

15:00.960 --> 15:02.039
Objection.

15:02.040 --> 15:04.039
Objection.

15:04.040 --> 15:05.829
Conjecture.

15:05.830 --> 15:08.789
Conjecture?

15:08.790 --> 15:10.460
Sustained.

15:12.790 --> 15:15.289
Mrs. McHugh, you're
nearsighted, correct? Yes.

15:15.290 --> 15:17.119
Is that why you're
wearing glasses today?

15:17.120 --> 15:18.619
Correct.

15:18.620 --> 15:21.080
Can you read this, Mrs. McHugh?

15:24.120 --> 15:25.289
Carrot.

15:25.290 --> 15:27.080
Would you mind
removing your glasses?

15:28.790 --> 15:30.289
Can you read this?

15:30.290 --> 15:31.669
Doesn't it still say carrot?

15:31.670 --> 15:34.119
Okay. But can you read it?

15:34.120 --> 15:35.789
It says carrot, right?

15:35.790 --> 15:37.379
Okay, okay! Just...

15:37.380 --> 15:39.120
Hold on.

15:46.880 --> 15:48.539
Can you read this?

15:48.540 --> 15:49.669
No.

15:49.670 --> 15:51.749
No, no, stop.

15:51.750 --> 15:52.789
And were you wearing
your glasses

15:52.790 --> 15:54.119
at the baseball game?

15:54.120 --> 15:55.619
I was not.

15:55.620 --> 15:57.170
I was wearing my contacts.

16:00.670 --> 16:02.749
As the evidence
clearly demonstrates,

16:02.750 --> 16:05.379
Carl French viciously attacked
a fellow parent

16:05.380 --> 16:07.789
because Mr. French's son
was playing poorly

16:07.790 --> 16:09.289
and he needed someone to blame.

16:09.290 --> 16:11.119
So he concocted a story

16:11.120 --> 16:14.749
about Mr. Orsua shining a laser
into his son's eyes.

16:14.750 --> 16:18.459
Carl French is guilty.

16:18.460 --> 16:21.669
Gave another man a concussion.

16:21.670 --> 16:25.459
"U." Umpire was there...
He didn't see a problem.

16:25.460 --> 16:29.420
"I." I don't believe eyes
were ever actually in danger.

16:31.120 --> 16:34.119
First things first, we
need to... Eat lunch.

16:34.120 --> 16:35.209
Were you not gonna say lunch?

16:35.210 --> 16:36.379
I thought you were gonna
say lunch.

16:36.380 --> 16:37.999
I'm hungry, too,
but let's pick a foreperson,

16:38.000 --> 16:39.579
knock that out,
then eat on the state's dime.

16:39.580 --> 16:42.499
Good call, Lydia. I don't
need a co-signer, yo.

16:42.500 --> 16:43.999
I'll be happy to serve
as foreperson.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.379
I promise I'll take it seriously

16:45.380 --> 16:46.499
and respect all
of your opinions.

16:46.500 --> 16:48.039
I can get all of us out
of here before 500.

16:48.040 --> 16:49.040
I vote for Lydia.

16:49.041 --> 16:51.789
- Lydia.
- Yeah, absolutely.

16:51.790 --> 16:54.539
Great. Lydia, fantastic.

16:54.540 --> 16:56.879
I know I said lunch,
but we should vote first.

16:56.880 --> 16:58.419
Because if we all agree,

16:58.420 --> 16:59.999
then we can just get
the hell out of here.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.460
Who thinks Carl is guilty?

17:03.000 --> 17:04.499
Seriously, dude?

17:04.500 --> 17:05.709
Were you not watching
the PowerPoint?

17:05.710 --> 17:07.459
The facts literally spell
"guilty."

17:07.460 --> 17:08.579
Sorry, that's the way
I saw the case.

17:08.579 --> 17:09.829
I'll be happy to explain.

17:09.829 --> 17:11.249
All right.

17:11.250 --> 17:12.380
Where are we eating?

17:19.619 --> 17:21.249
Rodney?

17:21.250 --> 17:22.460
What happened?

17:27.880 --> 17:30.919
Rodney... if you don't
tell me what happened,

17:30.920 --> 17:33.829
I can't help you.

17:33.830 --> 17:35.420
Have you been to the infirmary?

17:38.460 --> 17:40.710
Do you want me to get you
into protective custody?

17:46.580 --> 17:48.329
Listen.

17:48.330 --> 17:51.119
Jason signed the bond.

17:51.120 --> 17:54.169
The government
is reviewing the file.

17:54.170 --> 17:56.709
The prosecutor
has to interview him,

17:56.710 --> 17:58.830
but it's a formality
at this point.

18:00.290 --> 18:02.119
What happened on
"Project Runway"?

18:02.120 --> 18:03.289
What?

18:03.290 --> 18:05.079
"Project Runway"
was on last night.

18:05.080 --> 18:06.579
I asked you to take notes.

18:06.580 --> 18:07.619
Rodney...

18:07.620 --> 18:09.120
What happened to Olivier?

18:11.830 --> 18:14.459
He was safe.

18:14.460 --> 18:16.959
Who won?

18:16.960 --> 18:18.290
Kimberly.

18:20.290 --> 18:23.120
I've really grown to appreciate
her silhouettes.

18:26.580 --> 18:30.209
There was a lot of
personal drama this week.

18:30.210 --> 18:32.419
Tell me.

18:32.420 --> 18:36.669
The designers had to make
a day-to-night look for Nina.

18:36.670 --> 18:40.419
Anya picked this awful
mustard fabric at Mood,

18:40.420 --> 18:43.039
and when Nina saw it
in the workroom,

18:43.040 --> 18:46.000
she made that "I'm concerned
about your taste level" face.

18:47.790 --> 18:50.329
Anya was all about to cry,

18:50.330 --> 18:53.499
and everyone jumped in
to help her finish...

18:53.500 --> 18:54.749
Except Viktor.

18:54.750 --> 18:55.750
He thought it was cheating.

18:55.751 --> 18:57.539
Of course he did.

18:57.540 --> 19:01.329
The judges ended up
loving Anya's jumpsuit.

19:01.330 --> 19:05.959
It was this beautiful
bronzed color.

19:05.960 --> 19:09.169
Backless. Belted.

19:09.170 --> 19:12.919
Viktor totally wanted to
rat her out on the runway.

19:12.920 --> 19:14.669
But he held his tongue.

19:14.670 --> 19:16.829
Julie got eliminated.

19:16.830 --> 19:18.510
Kerry Washington
wasn't feeling her look...

19:21.960 --> 19:23.999
We need to get
this done quickly.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.789
What? We have a problem.

19:25.790 --> 19:26.959
What is the problem?

19:26.960 --> 19:28.619
The problem is you told me

19:28.620 --> 19:30.379
I was getting a little old
grandma who owns property,

19:30.380 --> 19:32.919
and that is not
a little old grandma.

19:32.920 --> 19:34.499
She wouldn't sign.

19:34.500 --> 19:35.669
Well, you can't sub her out

19:35.670 --> 19:37.499
with a friend who has a prior.

19:37.500 --> 19:39.789
That conviction is from 2005.

19:39.790 --> 19:41.539
He was 18.

19:41.540 --> 19:42.999
Two ounces of pot?

19:43.000 --> 19:44.169
That's, like, no pot.

19:44.170 --> 19:46.169
It's pot. It's a conviction.

19:46.170 --> 19:47.619
Which means I can't
sign off on this.

19:47.620 --> 19:49.119
I can't make this go away.

19:49.120 --> 19:50.120
You can find someone else.

19:50.121 --> 19:51.379
No, I can't.

19:51.380 --> 19:52.959
What happened to
the kinder, gentler...

19:52.960 --> 19:54.919
Don't with that.
I am right here.

19:54.920 --> 19:57.169
But I work in an office

19:57.170 --> 19:59.329
with policies and procedures
I have to follow.

19:59.330 --> 20:01.379
I need to get him out of there.

20:01.380 --> 20:02.879
He's only been in jail
for three days.

20:02.880 --> 20:04.419
And in only three days,

20:04.420 --> 20:05.999
he's gone from a guy
with light in his eyes

20:06.000 --> 20:08.459
to a guy with a bruised face.

20:08.460 --> 20:10.539
How would you do in jail
for three days?

20:10.540 --> 20:12.419
I'm doing everything I can.

20:12.420 --> 20:14.500
I am doing everything I can!

20:18.620 --> 20:20.459
I'll interview him.

20:20.460 --> 20:23.000
If I'm satisfied,
I will push this through.

20:24.880 --> 20:26.789
$100,000?

20:26.790 --> 20:28.119
Did Allison not discuss

20:28.120 --> 20:30.079
the amount of the bond with you?
She did.

20:30.080 --> 20:32.419
It's just different hearing
it in here in this office.

20:32.420 --> 20:33.829
There are official seals
on everything.

20:33.830 --> 20:35.039
If Rodney fails to appear,

20:35.040 --> 20:36.499
you're responsible
for that amount.

20:36.500 --> 20:37.999
I get it. By signing this bond,

20:38.000 --> 20:39.209
you're making yourself
responsible

20:39.210 --> 20:40.499
for Rodney appearing in court.

20:40.500 --> 20:41.579
When you say "responsible"...

20:41.580 --> 20:42.999
We could garnish your wages.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.579
Go after any assets you have.

20:44.580 --> 20:46.829
Which is why I'd like
to go over them now.

20:46.830 --> 20:47.750
I've got the bar.

20:47.751 --> 20:49.419
Bank owns most of it.

20:49.420 --> 20:51.079
A 2007 Grand Cherokee.
All paid for.

20:51.080 --> 20:52.539
According to the records,

20:52.540 --> 20:54.079
you also have a condo
in Pittsburgh.

20:54.080 --> 20:55.829
It's valued at 160 grand.

20:55.830 --> 20:57.419
No. That's my sister's.

20:57.420 --> 20:59.329
The deed and the mortgage
are in your name.

20:59.330 --> 21:01.459
But it's not mine.
Legally it is.

21:01.460 --> 21:03.999
I bought that for her
when her husband left her.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.289
Wait...

21:06.290 --> 21:08.709
You're telling me... We
could go after that house.

21:08.710 --> 21:10.499
This is in the event
that Rodney skips town

21:10.500 --> 21:11.709
or misses a court date.

21:11.710 --> 21:13.079
That shouldn't happen.

21:13.080 --> 21:15.419
I'm just required to lay out
the worst-case scenario.

21:15.420 --> 21:17.329
Right. Do you understand?

21:17.330 --> 21:19.169
I do.

21:19.170 --> 21:21.749
Good.

21:21.750 --> 21:24.419
But I can't. Do this.

21:24.420 --> 21:25.579
I know I said I would,

21:25.580 --> 21:27.789
but I can't risk
my sister's place.

21:27.790 --> 21:29.039
I have enough people
leaning on me.

21:29.040 --> 21:30.420
I can't handle another.

21:41.500 --> 21:44.999
Did anybody actually see
Mr. French strike Mr. Orsua?

21:45.000 --> 21:46.289
He went after him.

21:46.290 --> 21:47.329
They ended up under
the bleachers

21:47.330 --> 21:48.669
and the dude came out
with a cracked skull.

21:48.670 --> 21:49.829
So, no?

21:49.830 --> 21:50.959
What do you think happened?

21:50.960 --> 21:51.999
I don't know what happened.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.209
I just know no one testified

21:53.210 --> 21:54.709
to actually seeing Mr. French

21:54.710 --> 21:56.329
drive Mr. Orsua's head
into the ground.

21:56.330 --> 21:57.459
The lady did. The mom.

21:57.460 --> 21:58.959
No.

21:58.960 --> 22:00.289
She said her friend
told her that.

22:00.290 --> 22:02.419
Same difference. No, it's not.

22:02.420 --> 22:03.420
That testimony was inadmissible.

22:03.421 --> 22:05.379
- I heard it.
- Yeah. I heard it, too.

22:05.380 --> 22:06.789
- You have to ignore it.
- Why?

22:06.790 --> 22:08.249
- Because it was hearsay.
- Say what?

22:08.250 --> 22:09.329
Hearsay.

22:09.330 --> 22:10.619
An out-of-court statement

22:10.620 --> 22:12.999
offered for the truth
of the matter asserted.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.749
It was in court. I heard it.

22:14.750 --> 22:16.289
Yeah, I heard it, too. The mom.

22:16.290 --> 22:18.250
Listen.
I think you're probably right.

22:19.830 --> 22:21.619
But I also think French's wife

22:21.620 --> 22:23.919
was having an affair
with Mr. Orsua.

22:23.920 --> 22:25.879
What... She looked like
she felt so sorry for him

22:25.880 --> 22:27.459
when he was on the stand.

22:27.460 --> 22:30.249
Like, she cared about him
more than her husband.

22:30.250 --> 22:32.709
That would explain a lot.
I wish my husband would.

22:32.710 --> 22:34.619
We don't know that that's true
and, frankly, it's irrelevant.

22:34.620 --> 22:35.829
To you.

22:35.830 --> 22:37.289
I have my set of facts,
you have yours.

22:37.290 --> 22:38.539
That's not how facts work.

22:38.540 --> 22:40.919
I may not be a judge,
but that's how I feel.

22:40.920 --> 22:42.539
My facts are my facts.

22:42.540 --> 22:44.709
So you switching your vote yet,
Pops, or what?

22:44.710 --> 22:46.329
Not guilty.

22:46.330 --> 22:48.459
Well, I tried.

22:48.460 --> 22:49.789
We can all thank Mr. Belvedere

22:49.790 --> 22:51.790
for dragging this out
another day.

23:08.170 --> 23:09.579
I've been calling you.

23:09.580 --> 23:10.999
I know. I'm sorry.

23:11.000 --> 23:12.329
Thank you.

23:12.330 --> 23:14.789
I've been out
trying to find money.

23:14.790 --> 23:17.999
Weirdly, people who Rodney
hasn't seen for a few years

23:18.000 --> 23:20.789
don't want to be on the hook
for $100,000.

23:20.790 --> 23:22.879
This is crazy. Bail is crazy.

23:22.880 --> 23:25.329
The idea that freedom
depends on money.

23:25.330 --> 23:27.249
It's pretty much the whole
system, isn't it?

23:27.250 --> 23:28.959
It's cruel. It's stupid.

23:28.960 --> 23:30.039
And this is federal court.

23:30.040 --> 23:31.579
If Rodney were in state court,

23:31.580 --> 23:33.499
he'd actually have to
come up with the cash.

23:33.500 --> 23:35.249
I'm sure Leonard isn't helping.

23:35.250 --> 23:37.619
He actually is. Really?

23:37.620 --> 23:39.119
I'm sure you don't want
to hear that right now,

23:39.120 --> 23:41.000
but he's trying.

23:43.210 --> 23:45.919
I don't know what
it is about Rodney.

23:45.920 --> 23:47.749
If things had shaken out
differently,

23:47.750 --> 23:49.499
he could have gone to Princeton.

23:49.500 --> 23:51.249
He could be a lawyer.

23:51.250 --> 23:55.539
Or a fashion designer or
the next Kehinde Wiley.

23:55.540 --> 23:57.499
He would've been our friend.

23:57.500 --> 23:58.669
He would've come home

23:58.670 --> 24:00.619
and watched
"Master of Crowns" with us.

24:00.620 --> 24:03.249
Let's go home, Al.
And watch "Master of Crowns"...

24:03.250 --> 24:04.539
I don't want to go home.

24:04.540 --> 24:07.039
There's nothing you can do
here right now.

24:07.040 --> 24:08.709
We'll look for money
in the apartment.

24:08.710 --> 24:12.499
Maybe there's at least
four quarters in the couch.

24:12.500 --> 24:13.669
Let's go home.

24:13.670 --> 24:14.999
That's it.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.879
What?

24:16.880 --> 24:18.540
There is money in the apartment.

24:19.710 --> 24:20.879
Where?

24:20.880 --> 24:22.209
I need a favor.

24:22.210 --> 24:23.669
Where's the little vase
that was up here on the shelf?

24:23.670 --> 24:25.379
A client of mine,
Rodney Jenkins,

24:25.380 --> 24:26.919
is close to posting bail

24:26.920 --> 24:28.669
but I can't find a third
co-signer for the bond

24:28.670 --> 24:29.999
to put him over the top.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.749
Is that something we're
supposed to understand?

24:32.750 --> 24:36.419
I want to co-sign for Rodney
so he can get out of jail.

24:36.420 --> 24:37.459
It was right here...

24:37.460 --> 24:39.169
I don't own any property.

24:39.170 --> 24:40.919
The government will want that.

24:40.920 --> 24:42.749
I'm asking you to sign.

24:42.750 --> 24:44.329
Did you throw it away?

24:44.330 --> 24:45.959
Dad, I'm trying to talk to you.

24:45.960 --> 24:48.289
Sign what? The bond.

24:48.290 --> 24:50.249
She wants us to sign the bond.

24:50.250 --> 24:51.919
For Rodney?

24:51.920 --> 24:54.289
The Rodney we just heard
about three seconds ago?

24:54.290 --> 24:55.499
He's a criminal.

24:55.500 --> 24:56.539
He's not a criminal.

24:56.540 --> 24:57.959
He's in jail. He was arrested.

24:57.960 --> 24:59.879
For a crime. For
selling cigarettes...

24:59.880 --> 25:01.379
Which is a crime, right?

25:01.380 --> 25:04.829
Right? Why are you...

25:04.830 --> 25:06.579
Forget Rodney.
This isn't about Rodney.

25:06.580 --> 25:09.379
You would be doing this for me.

25:09.380 --> 25:12.379
I get 25% of my trust
when I turn 30.

25:12.380 --> 25:13.959
Skip it. Keep it.

25:13.960 --> 25:17.039
I am 100% sure Rodney will
make his court appearances,

25:17.040 --> 25:18.669
but this way you'd be protected.

25:18.670 --> 25:20.829
This is basically a loan to me.

25:20.830 --> 25:21.919
An advance on money

25:21.920 --> 25:23.419
you're already
planning on giving me,

25:23.420 --> 25:25.879
and all it takes is a signature.

25:25.880 --> 25:29.919
Al, I think you are improperly
attached to this Rodney.

25:29.920 --> 25:31.499
What? I agree.

25:31.500 --> 25:33.079
And there's a chance
it doesn't end here.

25:33.080 --> 25:34.379
He could be using you.

25:34.380 --> 25:36.749
Are you... You guys are serious?

25:36.750 --> 25:37.999
Yes, we're serious.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.289
And, no, we are not
signing for you or Rodney

25:40.290 --> 25:42.619
or anyone else
you fall in love with.

25:42.620 --> 25:45.419
You're just putting your name
on a piece of paper.

25:45.420 --> 25:46.499
Listen.

25:46.500 --> 25:48.169
I know you don't love

25:48.170 --> 25:49.829
what I'm doing with my life.

25:49.830 --> 25:52.329
I don't understand it,
and I think it's unfair.

25:52.330 --> 25:53.749
We can talk about that later.

25:53.750 --> 25:55.249
But right now?

25:55.250 --> 25:56.579
I am your daughter,

25:56.580 --> 25:58.919
and I am asking you for help.

25:58.920 --> 26:01.169
Please.

26:01.170 --> 26:02.669
I don't think it's a good idea,

26:02.670 --> 26:05.039
and I think at some point
when you are older,

26:05.040 --> 26:07.329
you will understand
and appreciate this decision.

26:07.330 --> 26:09.789
I am not a child! Really?

26:09.790 --> 26:12.999
You're living in our
apartment for free.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.289
You call us for money,
and for no other reason.

26:15.290 --> 26:16.959
You want, you ask, and you take

26:16.960 --> 26:18.999
with no consideration
for who we are.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.669
You are a child.

26:20.670 --> 26:22.669
You are our child
and we're your parents,

26:22.670 --> 26:23.999
and we're saying no.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.579
No.

26:25.580 --> 26:27.880
Find the vase and put it back.

26:43.580 --> 26:45.080
So, listen.

26:46.670 --> 26:47.919
Jason...

26:47.920 --> 26:51.289
I know.
I can see it on your face.

26:51.290 --> 26:52.709
I tried to raise
some money myself.

26:52.710 --> 26:54.209
Are we done here now?

26:54.210 --> 26:56.329
Rodney, I'm going to push

26:56.330 --> 26:58.289
to get a deferred
prosecution deal.

26:58.290 --> 26:59.619
That would mean no jail time...

26:59.620 --> 27:02.169
Yeah, I heard this before.
From you.

27:02.170 --> 27:04.749
No jail time. And here I am.

27:04.750 --> 27:06.749
In jail. For what?

27:06.750 --> 27:08.829
Two more weeks? Months?

27:08.830 --> 27:10.249
Five years?
It won't be that long.

27:10.250 --> 27:12.329
You keep saying that
and here I am!

27:12.330 --> 27:14.419
And I haven't even been
convicted of anything.

27:14.420 --> 27:17.170
I'm done talking.
I'm done talking to you.

27:23.460 --> 27:25.210
I'm sorry.
This isn't your fault.

27:27.420 --> 27:29.829
I just can't talk about
this anymore.

27:29.830 --> 27:33.289
I can't hope I'm gonna
get out anytime soon.

27:33.290 --> 27:36.119
The only way to survive
in here is to have no hope.

27:36.120 --> 27:38.829
Zero. To live minute by minute.

27:38.830 --> 27:40.460
I need to survive.

27:42.830 --> 27:47.789
I'm going to survive.

27:47.790 --> 27:50.499
I'm gonna make it through this
and do better.

27:50.500 --> 27:52.249
When I get out,
whenever that is,

27:52.250 --> 27:54.249
I'm gonna be a better man.

27:54.250 --> 27:56.459
I'm gonna be a father
who is there

27:56.460 --> 27:59.209
and provides for his daughter
in the right way.

27:59.210 --> 28:02.379
I want to be the person for her
that I never had.

28:02.380 --> 28:06.579
I want her to be happy,
and I want to be happy.

28:06.580 --> 28:12.040
But right now,
I can't have any hope.

28:15.880 --> 28:18.379
Because I need to survive.

28:18.380 --> 28:21.670
Because I want to live
to see something good.

28:37.120 --> 28:38.669
How do you do it?

28:38.670 --> 28:40.499
There's a little hook.

28:40.500 --> 28:42.209
No. Not that.

28:42.210 --> 28:43.419
Is it about the bike generally?

28:43.420 --> 28:45.289
How do you live with Seth?

28:45.290 --> 28:46.829
Because of the sleep walking?

28:46.830 --> 28:48.379
Because he's a prosecutor.

28:48.380 --> 28:51.289
That? That's not a problem.

28:51.290 --> 28:53.039
Don't you think it impacts
the way you do your job?

28:53.040 --> 28:54.579
It certainly doesn't make me
any less aggressive,

28:54.580 --> 28:55.669
if that's what you mean.

28:55.670 --> 28:57.209
If anything,
it's the other way around,

28:57.210 --> 28:59.079
especially if he's left
dishes in the sink.

28:59.080 --> 29:00.669
Or let that cat in
from across the hall.

29:00.670 --> 29:03.879
I do not like that cat.

29:03.880 --> 29:05.329
Why? Just curious.

29:05.330 --> 29:07.459
It's not an issue.
We do our jobs.

29:07.460 --> 29:08.749
I would never compromise
anything for him.

29:08.750 --> 29:09.959
And he wouldn't for me.

29:09.960 --> 29:11.249
And I don't think any of us
in this office

29:11.250 --> 29:12.540
would be any other way.

29:14.380 --> 29:15.579
How long have you been
sitting in here?

29:15.580 --> 29:17.169
An hour.

29:17.170 --> 29:18.750
That's weird. Right?

29:23.670 --> 29:25.999
It's really no better than
the coffee in the office.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.419
But we're out of the office. You
say that like it's a good thing.

29:28.420 --> 29:30.039
It is. We're out.

29:30.040 --> 29:32.079
In the city with people.

29:32.080 --> 29:35.710
In the vibrant,
pulsating life of the city.

29:37.040 --> 29:38.420
You returned that cocaine,
right?

29:39.830 --> 29:41.620
Okay, let's go. What?

29:43.620 --> 29:45.079
Why is he so short?

29:45.080 --> 29:47.079
He's a normal-sized man.

29:47.080 --> 29:49.289
I always thought he was,
like, seven feet tall

29:49.290 --> 29:51.620
with abs made of dark,
weathered granite.

29:53.170 --> 29:54.329
Come on. We need to leave now.

29:54.330 --> 29:56.169
We don't need to leave.
Why do we need to leave?

29:56.170 --> 29:57.249
Because I don't want to end up

29:57.250 --> 29:58.250
doing anything awkward.

29:58.251 --> 29:59.919
Then don't do something awkward.

29:59.920 --> 30:02.169
Not really an option.
Just sit here.

30:02.170 --> 30:04.000
I'm sure he doesn't even see us.
Judge!

30:05.920 --> 30:07.829
What the hell...

30:07.830 --> 30:10.079
I told you.
Now I have to go over.

30:10.080 --> 30:12.119
No, you don't.
You can stay here.

30:12.120 --> 30:14.079
He's there. You're here...

30:14.080 --> 30:16.039
Morning. Hello, Your Honor.

30:16.040 --> 30:17.750
Good morning, Ms. Littlejohn.
Mr. Oliver.

30:19.500 --> 30:21.880
Do you want to join me? No,
we don't want to bother you.

30:24.040 --> 30:25.830
Is that a juror badge?

30:27.580 --> 30:30.789
I'm serving our state court
this week from the jury box.

30:30.790 --> 30:32.879
Wow. That must be weird.

30:32.880 --> 30:34.169
Mostly for the others.

30:34.170 --> 30:35.379
Not that you're weird...

30:35.380 --> 30:37.039
Seth hasn't had his coffee.

30:37.040 --> 30:38.169
Yeah, it is weird.

30:38.170 --> 30:40.329
They have no respect
for what I do

30:40.330 --> 30:42.169
and my years of experience
in the courtroom.

30:42.170 --> 30:43.709
Well, that's kind of the point.

30:43.710 --> 30:44.749
Right? Seth...

30:44.750 --> 30:46.789
No, I just mean, you're a judge.

30:46.790 --> 30:48.079
They're people.

30:48.080 --> 30:50.079
They're supposed to be
just people.

30:50.080 --> 30:52.579
With no special knowledge
or experience.

30:52.580 --> 30:55.499
If it was all judges
and lawyers on a jury,

30:55.500 --> 30:59.789
it wouldn't be a jury.
It'd be a... judgery.

30:59.790 --> 31:02.379
He's not well...

31:02.380 --> 31:05.539
That's an excellent point,
Mr. Oliver.

31:05.540 --> 31:08.079
There's no room for
a judge on that jury.

31:08.080 --> 31:09.670
Thank you.

31:18.830 --> 31:20.789
What are those? Doughsants.

31:20.790 --> 31:23.289
Part doughnut, part croissant.

31:23.290 --> 31:25.039
I figured since I've been
the one muddying up the works,

31:25.040 --> 31:27.419
I could at least bring a treat.

31:27.420 --> 31:29.499
I'm open to change my vote.

31:29.500 --> 31:31.539
I realize I may have been
stubborn and arrogant

31:31.540 --> 31:32.619
up to this point.

31:32.620 --> 31:33.879
So, go ahead.

31:33.880 --> 31:35.789
Tell me why French is guilty.

31:35.790 --> 31:37.169
He ran at the guy.

31:37.170 --> 31:38.829
He was yelling. He was.

31:38.830 --> 31:40.579
He had all the reason
in the world to do it

31:40.580 --> 31:42.829
because of the laser pointer
being shined at his kid.

31:42.830 --> 31:44.379
And because of
the affair the guy

31:44.380 --> 31:45.579
was having with French's wife.

31:45.580 --> 31:46.789
Those shoes he was wearing.

31:46.790 --> 31:48.379
They're not shoes.
They're not sandals.

31:48.380 --> 31:49.999
What are they? They're douchey.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.250
I own the same pair.

31:52.830 --> 31:55.289
I had to bail my daughter
out of jail once.

31:55.290 --> 31:56.999
A friend dragged her to a party.

31:57.000 --> 31:58.000
It got busted.

31:58.001 --> 31:59.539
That friend bought drugs.

31:59.540 --> 32:01.709
My daughter was carrying
her purse.

32:01.710 --> 32:03.959
They didn't charge her
because of who I am.

32:03.960 --> 32:06.289
But if they did...
If she went to trial,

32:06.290 --> 32:07.789
who would believe that
she went to that party

32:07.790 --> 32:09.329
and didn't drink or do drugs?

32:09.330 --> 32:10.789
It's not logical.

32:10.790 --> 32:14.039
I'm her father, and I assumed
that she was lying.

32:14.040 --> 32:15.789
Listen, that dude
might have done it.

32:15.790 --> 32:17.959
Probably did. I think he did.
I'll be honest.

32:17.960 --> 32:19.879
But if I'm putting myself
in his position,

32:19.880 --> 32:21.539
or my daughter's...

32:21.540 --> 32:24.250
And we've all been there...
Is that enough?

32:26.380 --> 32:28.669
My husband fights
with other parents

32:28.670 --> 32:30.379
at my daughter's soccer games.

32:30.380 --> 32:31.829
I hate it.

32:31.830 --> 32:34.619
Maybe that has something to do
with how I'm thinking.

32:34.620 --> 32:36.669
People in my building accuse me
of hogging three dryers

32:36.670 --> 32:38.539
with no evidence at all.

32:38.540 --> 32:40.750
I do. I hog them.
But they don't know that.

32:43.080 --> 32:45.539
Is second-degree assault
too much

32:45.540 --> 32:47.750
for a skirmish at
a Little League game?

32:55.290 --> 32:56.290
Rodney?

32:59.790 --> 33:02.789
Rodney.

33:02.790 --> 33:04.999
I feel like I can see
the future with him.

33:05.000 --> 33:07.959
Two distinct paths.

33:07.960 --> 33:09.709
We get him out on bond,

33:09.710 --> 33:12.079
Leonard and I work out
a deferred prosecution deal

33:12.080 --> 33:15.879
and he turns this all around.

33:15.880 --> 33:18.579
He can be special
at anything he does.

33:18.580 --> 33:20.209
The other path?

33:20.210 --> 33:23.249
You know what it is. I do.

33:23.250 --> 33:26.879
I asked my parents
to sign the bond.

33:26.880 --> 33:30.419
Okay. That's... unorthodox.

33:30.420 --> 33:32.539
They said no. Why?

33:32.540 --> 33:34.169
I don't know.

33:34.170 --> 33:36.619
I don't understand my parents.

33:36.620 --> 33:39.919
I never have.

33:39.920 --> 33:41.669
I was a horrible kid growing up.

33:41.670 --> 33:44.289
I was an army brat.
We moved a lot.

33:44.290 --> 33:46.039
The easiest way
to make new friends

33:46.040 --> 33:47.879
is to fall in with the bad kids.

33:47.880 --> 33:50.249
I stole. I drank. I liked girls.

33:50.250 --> 33:51.999
Before I knew it,

33:52.000 --> 33:53.789
I was 23 with a son

33:53.790 --> 33:57.419
and I hadn't spoken to
my parents in four years.

33:57.420 --> 33:59.120
What's his name?

34:00.620 --> 34:02.330
Marvin.

34:03.460 --> 34:06.079
I wanted him to have
a nerdier name than me.

34:06.080 --> 34:08.748
Marvin.

34:08.750 --> 34:12.500
His name was Marvin.

34:18.580 --> 34:20.500
I'm sorry.

34:22.460 --> 34:25.379
Um...

34:25.380 --> 34:27.748
When he passed,

34:27.750 --> 34:30.208
my parents were on
my doorstep the next morning.

34:30.210 --> 34:34.789
They drove 16 hours
from Chicago.

34:34.790 --> 34:37.119
Stayed with me for a month.

34:37.120 --> 34:39.119
I was done.

34:39.120 --> 34:42.458
I was done.

34:42.460 --> 34:45.040
And they brought me
back to life.

34:47.500 --> 34:50.958
Parents don't always do
what we want when we want,

34:50.960 --> 34:52.748
but they try to do their best.

34:52.750 --> 34:54.498
And they come through

34:54.500 --> 34:57.459
when they know
you have nowhere else to go.

34:57.460 --> 34:59.500
Your parents made
that calculation.

35:01.790 --> 35:03.169
I'll be fine.

35:03.170 --> 35:06.039
But Rodney doesn't have parents.

35:06.040 --> 35:08.079
And the people he does have?

35:08.080 --> 35:10.169
They are not coming through
for him.

35:10.170 --> 35:12.459
This whole experience has
reinforced every awful thing

35:12.460 --> 35:13.919
that's happened in his life.

35:13.920 --> 35:15.709
I am his person here,

35:15.710 --> 35:19.329
and I can't do
a damn thing for him.

35:19.330 --> 35:22.289
Maybe these people
don't know what you know?

35:22.290 --> 35:23.290
What's that?

35:23.291 --> 35:26.119
That this is it for Rodney.

35:26.120 --> 35:28.289
That this is the moment

35:28.290 --> 35:30.619
that will make him or break him.

35:30.620 --> 35:33.460
You have to make them see
what you see.

35:35.420 --> 35:37.249
Or you can give up.

35:37.250 --> 35:39.669
You've done a lot
for him already.

35:39.670 --> 35:41.420
What are you gonna do?

35:49.000 --> 35:50.329
What you asked for.

35:50.330 --> 35:52.669
The police report from the night
Roger Gunn was swatted.

35:52.670 --> 35:55.789
You were right. Jill was there.

35:55.790 --> 35:57.079
I'm not a lawyer.

35:57.080 --> 35:58.209
I don't have to follow
your rules.

35:58.210 --> 36:00.119
But I know people. I know Jill.

36:00.120 --> 36:02.829
I know what she gives
to this job.

36:02.830 --> 36:04.830
I would leave it alone.

36:14.920 --> 36:16.169
Welcome back!

36:16.170 --> 36:17.249
Let me do a quick count
to make sure

36:17.250 --> 36:19.079
we didn't lose anyone
on the trip.

36:19.080 --> 36:21.379
Great. Still have 12.

36:21.380 --> 36:23.249
Now, I understand
you've reached a verdict.

36:23.250 --> 36:26.619
Yeah, it took awhile,
but we got it.

36:26.620 --> 36:28.669
What say you?

36:28.670 --> 36:30.829
We, the jury, in the case

36:30.830 --> 36:33.919
of the People of the State of
New York v. Carl French,

36:33.920 --> 36:36.790
find the defendant not guilty.

36:49.120 --> 36:51.539
Good afternoon, Juror Number 9!

36:51.540 --> 36:53.580
Please.

36:55.710 --> 36:57.749
Number 4. And?

36:57.750 --> 36:58.959
How was it?

36:58.960 --> 37:00.460
Not what I expected.

37:01.880 --> 37:05.879
But still interesting.

37:05.880 --> 37:09.079
Alarming, sad, unfair,
frustrating.

37:09.080 --> 37:11.249
Deeply unsettling at times.

37:11.250 --> 37:16.919
But, you know, all those people,

37:16.920 --> 37:19.169
they got it right in the end.

37:19.170 --> 37:20.619
I think.

37:20.620 --> 37:22.879
Wasn't always clear
that they would.

37:22.880 --> 37:24.669
That we would.

37:24.670 --> 37:27.829
People were drawing pictures
more than I think is healthy

37:27.830 --> 37:32.960
in that environment, but
I think we did get it right.

37:34.750 --> 37:35.879
And, you know, over here,

37:35.880 --> 37:38.579
we have all these
great lawyers and judges

37:38.580 --> 37:41.709
who are so smart
and so learned and so rigorous,

37:41.710 --> 37:45.039
and they get it wrong.

37:45.040 --> 37:47.249
A lot.

37:47.250 --> 37:50.499
At a real cost to
people's lives.

37:50.500 --> 37:53.169
This system is imperfect
and unfair

37:53.170 --> 37:57.669
in ways
I never really understood.

37:57.670 --> 37:58.789
You didn't talk to them
like that, did you?

37:58.790 --> 38:01.419
A-At first, yeah.

38:01.420 --> 38:03.619
Didn't go over well.

38:03.620 --> 38:05.209
I wouldn't think so.

38:05.210 --> 38:06.539
But we warmed up to each other.

38:06.540 --> 38:08.419
We... We talked to
each other like people.

38:08.420 --> 38:10.749
The jury room.
The hospital waiting room.

38:10.750 --> 38:13.619
The subway car.

38:13.620 --> 38:14.879
There aren't many places left

38:14.880 --> 38:16.459
where you're just
one little person

38:16.460 --> 38:19.209
bumping up against
another little person.

38:19.210 --> 38:23.459
All together, all elevated...

38:23.460 --> 38:25.209
Or diminished, I suppose,

38:25.210 --> 38:27.539
depending on
where you came from.

38:27.540 --> 38:29.879
All equal.

38:29.880 --> 38:33.040
And in that moment, anyway,
all connected.

38:40.120 --> 38:42.249
I don't have anything
left to say.

38:42.250 --> 38:45.500
I know. I was hoping
I could just say something.

38:49.000 --> 38:51.879
I liked Rodney instantly.

38:51.880 --> 38:54.249
That's not usually
how it works for me.

38:54.250 --> 38:56.249
I felt like I knew him for years

38:56.250 --> 38:58.329
the second I laid eyes on him.

38:58.330 --> 39:03.829
He's smart, sensitive,
optimistic, charming.

39:03.830 --> 39:07.079
He did not have all of
the things I had growing up,

39:07.080 --> 39:09.499
but he had you.

39:09.500 --> 39:13.499
Rodney is such a great person
because of you.

39:13.500 --> 39:16.879
My parents sent me
to the best schools,

39:16.880 --> 39:19.329
put me in the best clothes.

39:19.330 --> 39:22.169
I live in their immaculate
apartment.

39:22.170 --> 39:24.499
But I don't have their support.

39:24.500 --> 39:27.249
That hurts me.

39:27.250 --> 39:31.709
I know it, but it
surprises me every time.

39:31.710 --> 39:33.499
I can't complain

39:33.500 --> 39:36.379
because they've given me
everything else,

39:36.380 --> 39:41.329
because this world we live in,
this system,

39:41.330 --> 39:45.539
it is set up
to help people like me.

39:45.540 --> 39:47.829
Cut one string?

39:47.830 --> 39:51.579
There are a thousand
others holding me up.

39:51.580 --> 39:54.459
The system is stacked
against Rodney.

39:54.460 --> 39:58.169
I'm not making excuses for him,
but it's true.

39:58.170 --> 40:00.039
We all make mistakes.

40:00.040 --> 40:01.379
Some of us are lucky enough

40:01.380 --> 40:03.669
to not have our mistakes
come back and haunt us.

40:03.670 --> 40:06.169
It's a luxury.

40:06.170 --> 40:09.079
Rodney has one string left.

40:09.080 --> 40:11.419
One person left.

40:11.420 --> 40:14.209
You can't cut the string.

40:14.210 --> 40:17.380
Not now when he has
nothing else holding him up.
