WILBERT L. COOPER:
The RV's stuck.

00:04.910 --> 00:06.140
Is it touching another car?

00:06.140 --> 00:07.200
WILBERT L. COOPER:
It's touching the car.

00:07.200 --> 00:08.770
Is it hurting it?
WILBERT L. COOPER: Yes.

00:08.770 --> 00:09.770
It's hurting it?

00:11.550 --> 00:13.760
WILBERT L. COOPER:
Basically, we're like this.

00:13.760 --> 00:17.880
So if we go backwards, we
can't, because it's like that.

00:17.880 --> 00:18.880
We'll come into it.

00:18.880 --> 00:20.300
Can we just go straight?

00:20.300 --> 00:23.400
Yeah, sir, do you know whose
car this is by any chance?

00:23.400 --> 00:24.620
No, I don't live here.

00:24.620 --> 00:25.620
OK.

00:25.620 --> 00:27.070
MARTINA DE ALBA: We
didn't park well.

00:27.070 --> 00:31.840
It's my fault. I
drove the RV here.

00:31.840 --> 00:34.490
We tried to move it
out, and it got worse.

00:34.490 --> 00:38.830
And now, nobody can
do anything about it.

00:38.830 --> 00:40.240
You know, the gap
is not that big.

00:40.240 --> 00:41.240
Yeah.

00:41.240 --> 00:42.560
Is this a stolen towel?

00:42.560 --> 00:44.290
MARTINA DE ALBA: Yeah, it's
from the hotel, I think.

00:44.290 --> 00:45.290
MAN: It's from the hotel?

00:45.290 --> 00:47.910
I think just hop
in there and back up.

00:47.910 --> 00:49.520
Let's try it again.
- I can't.

00:49.520 --> 00:50.520
No, you got it.

00:50.520 --> 00:51.520
No, you gotta to do.

00:51.520 --> 00:53.710
You gotta undone
what you done done.

00:53.710 --> 00:55.500
No, I'm going to
destroy this car.

00:55.500 --> 00:56.500
No, you won't.

There's a towel
there protecting you.

to the monument of our
forefathers, Mount Rushmore.

there it is, guys--

02:32.160 --> 02:37.130
Mount Rushmore, covered in fog.

you guys impressed?

02:39.660 --> 02:41.220
MARTINA DE ALBA: Yeah
ABDULLAH SAEED: It's big.

02:41.220 --> 02:42.920
WILBERT L. COOPER: I mean,
it's an incredible feat,

02:42.920 --> 02:45.620
to be able to put something
like this together.

02:45.620 --> 02:46.920
ABDULLAH SAEED: Do
you think these guys

02:46.920 --> 02:48.500
deserve to be on a statue?

02:48.500 --> 02:49.500
WILBERT L. COOPER: Yeah.

02:49.500 --> 02:50.850
I think people are complex.

02:50.850 --> 02:52.500
Like, when I look at
these some of these guys,

02:52.500 --> 02:54.310
I automatically
think slave owners,

02:54.310 --> 02:56.700
people that were horrible
and enslaved my people.

02:56.700 --> 02:59.250
But also, there are
certain ideas and concepts

02:59.250 --> 03:01.500
that they brought to the
table that I can appreciate

03:01.500 --> 03:02.760
and take stuff away from.

03:02.760 --> 03:05.340
Some of the most fascinating
historical figures

03:05.340 --> 03:06.630
have a duality to them.

03:06.630 --> 03:08.330
And it's not all good,
and it's not all bad.

03:13.170 --> 03:14.970

wanted to see Mount Rushmore,

03:14.970 --> 03:16.400
like, your whole life?
- Yeah.

03:16.400 --> 03:17.260
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

like, so special to you?

Mallorca, Spain.

03:27.130 --> 03:28.350
Oh, I've been.
It's beautiful.

03:28.350 --> 03:29.820
It is very beautiful, yeah.

03:29.820 --> 03:31.380
Which one of these
guys is your favorite?

03:31.380 --> 03:32.400
Lincoln.

there's any candidate right now

03:34.710 --> 03:36.730
who's anywhere near Lincoln?

03:36.730 --> 03:38.600
No?

He might.
He might.

03:45.530 --> 03:47.100
WILBERT L. COOPER: Do
you think he deserves to?

03:47.100 --> 03:49.370
I think he's done the best
he could do in the situation he

03:49.370 --> 03:52.280
went into, OK?

03:52.280 --> 03:54.600
He didn't do it.

03:54.600 --> 03:55.930
I think he's tried very hard.

03:55.930 --> 03:57.650
I really do.

- Thank you.
- All right, take care.

04:05.430 --> 04:07.400
WILBERT L. COOPER: I think it's
actually really interesting

04:07.400 --> 04:09.290
that, in the United
States, we sort

04:09.290 --> 04:12.800
of treat our own national
mythology as a religion.

04:12.800 --> 04:14.990
I can't think of
another place that

04:14.990 --> 04:18.220
carves actual people's faces
into the sides of mountains.

04:18.220 --> 04:22.610
Gods, sure, but you know, these
are actual guys that lived.

04:22.610 --> 04:25.400
America is such a young
country that if you don't treat

04:25.400 --> 04:28.850
its founding somewhat
like a religion,

04:28.850 --> 04:31.040
then you can't
convince everybody

04:31.040 --> 04:32.120
to really buy into it.

04:32.120 --> 04:35.500
[MUSIC PLAYING]

04:39.170 --> 04:40.400
ABDULLAH SAEED
(VOICEOVER): This land

04:40.400 --> 04:43.100
used to be home to
the Lakota Sioux,

04:43.100 --> 04:45.740
and just 16 miles
from Mount Rushmore

04:45.740 --> 04:48.620
is the unfinished
Crazy Horse Memorial.

04:48.620 --> 04:51.410
Crazy Horse became
legendary in the 1800s

04:51.410 --> 04:53.540
for taking up arms
against the government,

04:53.540 --> 04:56.930
defending the Lakota territory
and their way of life.

04:56.930 --> 04:58.160
WILBERT L. COOPER:
So I guess he was,

04:58.160 --> 05:00.500
like, kind of a peaceful
dude at first, you know?

05:00.500 --> 05:03.260
After they took the land,
they put the Native Americans

05:03.260 --> 05:04.780
on a reservation,
and then, they didn't

05:04.780 --> 05:06.350
give 'em, like, the food
and clothing that they

05:06.350 --> 05:07.490
said they were gonna do.

05:07.490 --> 05:09.120
And that was when he was
like, yo, this is it.

05:09.120 --> 05:10.120
Enough is enough.

05:10.120 --> 05:11.810
ABDULLAH SAEED: There he is.

05:11.810 --> 05:12.940
But you can't
really see his face.

05:12.940 --> 05:13.910
MARTINA DE ALBA: Where, a guy?

05:13.910 --> 05:15.760
ABDULLAH SAEED: His head is
up-- see on the right side?

05:15.760 --> 05:16.430
WILBERT L. COOPER: His
head is in the clouds.

05:16.430 --> 05:16.980
ABDULLAH SAEED:
That's, like, the arm.

05:16.980 --> 05:17.840
His head's in the clouds.

05:17.840 --> 05:19.170
MARTINA DE ALBA: His
head in the clouds.

05:19.170 --> 05:20.400
[LAUGHS]

05:20.400 --> 05:21.950
ABDULLAH SAEED: That's
pretty sweet, man.

05:21.950 --> 05:23.750
Once it's done, it's
gonna be the biggest

05:23.750 --> 05:25.070
statue in the world.

05:25.070 --> 05:27.470
You'll be able to fit
all four Mount Rushmore

05:27.470 --> 05:30.220
heads in Crazy Horse's head.

05:30.220 --> 05:31.790
WILBERT L. COOPER: The
reason why he's pointing

05:31.790 --> 05:33.560
is that someone asked Crazy
Horse, they're like, you,

05:33.560 --> 05:34.560
where are your lands?

05:34.560 --> 05:35.570
And he pointed.

05:35.570 --> 05:36.920
And where he was
pointing is saying,

05:36.920 --> 05:38.390
basically, that,
my lands are where

05:38.390 --> 05:39.680
my people's bodies are buried.

05:44.030 --> 05:46.790
Unfortunately, we got here on
the one day that it's cloudy.

05:46.790 --> 05:48.420
It's supposed to be
like 100 degrees,

05:48.420 --> 05:50.210
but we can't see
anything right now.

05:50.210 --> 05:53.150
But we're gonna get a much
better idea of what the Lakota

05:53.150 --> 05:54.560
people are all about,
because we're gonna

05:54.560 --> 05:56.900
travel east through
South Dakota to hang

05:56.900 --> 05:58.540
out with some tribespeople.

ABDULLAH SAEED (VOICEOVER):
From here, we head

06:08.870 --> 06:10.700
deeper into the Black Hills.

06:10.700 --> 06:14.030
We were invited to a camp
constructed by the Lakota Sioux

06:14.030 --> 06:16.850
to protest the building
of the Keystone Pipeline.

06:16.850 --> 06:19.090
PAULA ANTOINE: We are here
for one simple reason,

06:19.090 --> 06:20.810
and it is to tell
President Obama

06:20.810 --> 06:23.510
to reject the
Keystone XL Pipeline

06:23.510 --> 06:25.010
to protect our land and water.

06:25.010 --> 06:26.540
ABDULLAH SAEED (VOICEOVER):
If it's completed,

06:26.540 --> 06:29.960
the pipeline will pump
700,000 barrels of heavy tar

06:29.960 --> 06:33.080
sands oil a day across the US.

06:33.080 --> 06:35.790
Considering the oil spills
we've had in the past,

06:35.790 --> 06:38.390
this could have a catastrophic
effect on local water supplies

06:38.390 --> 06:39.390
and farmland.

06:44.870 --> 06:45.900
ABDULLAH SAEED: How's it going?

06:45.900 --> 06:47.050
Abdullah.

06:47.050 --> 06:48.880
So where exactly
are we right now?

06:48.880 --> 06:51.100
PAULA ANTOINE: You're
on tribal land.

06:51.100 --> 06:55.030
We set up a Spirit
Camp here in opposition

06:55.030 --> 06:58.510
to the KeyXL pipeline, and
we set up a teepee camp,

06:58.510 --> 07:00.370
and you'll be staying
in some of our teepees.

07:00.370 --> 07:01.600
GARY DORR: That's
what this camp is--

07:01.600 --> 07:04.090
a physical embodiment
of every single prayer

07:04.090 --> 07:06.490
that we have against
this pipeline.

07:06.490 --> 07:08.880
The name of the camp
is [NON-ENGLISH],,

07:08.880 --> 07:11.670
and it's "the place
where it turns,"

07:11.670 --> 07:13.180
"the place where it turns."

07:13.180 --> 07:14.980
And we chose that
name because we

07:14.980 --> 07:17.410
aim to turn it around and send
it back to wherever the hell

07:17.410 --> 07:19.010
it came from.

07:19.010 --> 07:21.850
PAULA ANTOINE: Prophesies
were told years and years ago

07:21.850 --> 07:24.280
about a black snake
coming through that

07:24.280 --> 07:29.260
would destroy the land and the
water and devastate the people.

07:29.260 --> 07:31.710
GARY DORR: And this is the
last stand for the great Sioux

07:31.710 --> 07:33.280
Nation, for all the Lakotas.

07:33.280 --> 07:37.310
If construction starts, it
won't get past this point.

07:37.310 --> 07:38.440
ABDULLAH SAEED:
Please educate us.

07:38.440 --> 07:41.880
[MUSIC PLAYING]

07:50.250 --> 07:52.560
MARTINA DE ALBA: Before, you
were talking about that this

07:52.560 --> 07:54.750
is, like, a spiritual site.

07:54.750 --> 07:55.750
GARY DORR: Yes.

07:55.750 --> 07:56.750
MARTINA DE ALBA: Right?

07:56.750 --> 07:57.940
What do you mean by that?

07:57.940 --> 07:59.790
GARY DORR: This is the
physical embodiment

07:59.790 --> 08:03.930
of the entire
Rosebud Sioux tribe,

08:03.930 --> 08:05.830
of the fight against
the Keystone Pipeline.

08:05.830 --> 08:08.520
The people wanted us to be
all militant at the start.

08:08.520 --> 08:11.400
They wanted us to carry guns
out here and have security.

08:11.400 --> 08:12.400
What do you see?

08:12.400 --> 08:13.400
There's nothing here.

08:13.400 --> 08:16.260
There's nothing to
be militant against.

08:16.260 --> 08:18.540
You're talking about the
poorest three counties

08:18.540 --> 08:20.700
in the entire United States.

08:20.700 --> 08:22.140
PAULA ANTOINE: We
have homes where
