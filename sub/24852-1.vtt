WEBVTT

04:45.208 --> 04:48.250
A quickie before work, hm?

05:37.665 --> 05:39.873
- Have we towels?
- What?

05:39.875 --> 05:42.456
- Towels.
- Yeah, in there.

05:42.458 --> 05:44.375
Uh, it's soaking wet.

05:46.290 --> 05:48.456
I put them all in the wash
yesterday. Sorry.

05:48.458 --> 05:49.913
And they ain't dry?

05:49.915 --> 05:50.956
They're
in the tumble dryer.

05:50.958 --> 05:52.875
I forgot to get them out.

05:56.665 --> 05:59.538
I'm at work all day. I can't
do the laundry and all.

05:59.540 --> 06:00.832
I know.

06:05.708 --> 06:07.498
Hey.

06:07.500 --> 06:08.790
It stinks.

06:29.165 --> 06:31.331
- Shall I wear that one?
- Yeah.

06:31.333 --> 06:34.456
- Sure?
- Yeah, it looks nice.

06:34.458 --> 06:35.498
I've got to look
the part today

06:35.500 --> 06:37.206
'cause he's coming in.

06:37.208 --> 06:39.125
I know, you said.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.665
I ain't getting very dry with
this fucking towel, am I?

06:48.333 --> 06:49.873
Want me to do that?

06:49.875 --> 06:52.498
I've got a bad feeling about
this meeting, that's all.

06:52.500 --> 06:54.415
Yeah, chuck that on
for us, would you?

06:56.040 --> 06:57.913
Definitely this color?

06:57.915 --> 06:59.875
Yeah, it looks nice
like that.

07:02.040 --> 07:04.000
Don't feel bad about it.

07:05.833 --> 07:07.750
Can't go somewhere else
now, can I?

07:09.333 --> 07:11.456
No.

07:11.458 --> 07:13.458
Alright. It's alright.
I'll get the kids up.

07:14.500 --> 07:16.415
Will you do the bed?

07:23.415 --> 07:24.498
What one do you want?

07:26.375 --> 07:28.831
Big spoon? Little spoon?

07:28.833 --> 07:31.163
What's the matter, Ted?
What?

07:31.165 --> 07:34.248
You're not gonna eat
your breakfast? Why?

07:34.250 --> 07:36.413
- I'm making some.
- Who went to the poo?

07:36.415 --> 07:38.748
You do stinky,
stinky, stinky!

07:40.625 --> 07:43.706
- Come on.
- No.

07:43.708 --> 07:45.623
Come on, kids.
Eat your breakfast.

07:45.625 --> 07:46.623
I've got to get out.

07:46.625 --> 07:48.583
Daddy's got to go
to work.

07:50.333 --> 07:51.873
- Bye, winkles.
- Yum, yum, yum.

07:51.875 --> 07:54.998
- Bye, you winkle.
- Eat all your breakfasts.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.581
- Come on, Ted. Come on.
- No. No.

07:57.583 --> 08:00.748
Otherwise you're gonna be
hungry later. Come on.

08:00.750 --> 08:02.913
Oh, he doesn't have to
if he doesn't want to.

08:02.915 --> 08:05.123
Come on, let's get
all our stuff together.

08:05.125 --> 08:06.123
- Alright, see you later.
- Bye, daddy.

08:06.125 --> 08:08.581
Love you. Bye-bye.

08:08.583 --> 08:09.623
Come on, let's go
and say goodbye

08:09.625 --> 08:10.706
to him at the window.

08:10.708 --> 08:12.788
- Come on!
- Quick! Quick!

08:12.790 --> 08:15.123
Quick, say goodbye
to daddy at the window.

08:15.125 --> 08:16.581
Ready?

08:16.583 --> 08:18.123
- You dropped it.
- Where is he?

08:18.125 --> 08:19.956
Where is he?

08:19.958 --> 08:21.538
- Where is he?
- Hello.

08:21.540 --> 08:22.956
Hello.

08:22.958 --> 08:24.706
Big eyes. Bye, big eyes.

08:24.708 --> 08:26.791
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

08:28.083 --> 08:30.413
Bye, Mr. Farty Bottom.

08:30.415 --> 08:32.414
Bye-bye.

08:41.082 --> 08:44.330
- Sometimes it crashes...
- It crash into the bush.

08:44.332 --> 08:45.373
Oh, no.

08:45.375 --> 08:46.998
With all the spider webs.

08:47.000 --> 08:50.873
Whoo!
No, I didn't crash.

08:50.875 --> 08:52.664
Let's cross the road here.

08:52.666 --> 08:54.583
One way. The other way.

08:57.332 --> 08:59.330
Gotta check, check, check.

08:59.332 --> 09:02.539
Stop. Stop. Walk.

09:02.541 --> 09:04.623
I know, it was really
bad, wasn't it, earlier?

09:04.625 --> 09:07.580
- Yeah, it's, um..
- Bye-bye, sweetheart.

09:10.082 --> 09:13.164
Eat it. Eat it. Eat.

09:13.166 --> 09:16.039
- We going in there.
- We're going in there.

09:16.041 --> 09:17.373
Good morning, Ted.

09:17.375 --> 09:19.164
Why don't you come
and find your little tag?

09:19.166 --> 09:21.205
Come here.
Which one's your name?

09:21.207 --> 09:22.539
- There.
- No.

09:22.541 --> 09:23.791
No.

09:25.541 --> 09:27.039
That's it.

09:32.707 --> 09:33.957
And you too.

09:35.291 --> 09:38.873
See you later.
Have a good day. Bye.

09:38.875 --> 09:40.875
- Bye.
- Have a good day. Bye.

12:24.582 --> 12:26.748
Here, Ted,
will you give me a kiss?

12:26.750 --> 12:29.205
What are these?

12:29.207 --> 12:32.623
I think they are fans.

12:32.625 --> 12:35.207
- They are fans.
- They are fans.

12:36.582 --> 12:38.375
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

14:27.457 --> 14:29.375
You've just woken me up.

14:30.500 --> 14:32.998
- Sorry.
- Why are you up so early?

14:33.000 --> 14:34.957
I was gonna make
a cup of tea.

14:37.166 --> 14:38.248
Do you want a cup of tea?

14:38.250 --> 14:40.123
No. Come here.

14:40.125 --> 14:41.998
Hey. Come here.

14:42.000 --> 14:42.957
Why?

14:44.332 --> 14:46.750
Just be really quiet.

14:51.666 --> 14:53.083
Shh.

15:07.875 --> 15:09.332
Go on.

16:19.750 --> 16:22.164
- I'm gonna pop out.
- Okay.

16:22.166 --> 16:24.750
- Need anything?
- Um..

16:26.500 --> 16:28.666
No. No, I'm good.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.957
Where's, where's the kids?

16:33.166 --> 16:34.664
In the kitchen.

16:34.666 --> 16:35.789
And they're
watching telly?

16:35.791 --> 16:37.416
- Mm-hm.
- Okay.

16:40.125 --> 16:42.664
Lucky, ain't we?

16:42.666 --> 16:43.958
Yeah.

16:46.416 --> 16:48.333
Pretty special, innit?

16:50.250 --> 16:51.457
Yeah.

16:53.125 --> 16:55.207
Ain't like this
for most people, is it?

16:57.332 --> 16:59.625
We done alright.
We done alright.

17:01.750 --> 17:02.957
Yeah.

17:04.833 --> 17:06.622
I'm gonna get some charcoal and
a bit more booze, alright?

17:06.624 --> 17:08.163
Okay.

17:08.165 --> 17:09.205
- See you in a bit.
- Give us a kiss.

17:09.208 --> 17:11.165
See you in a bit.

18:13.208 --> 18:15.208
I wish we had treats.

18:41.250 --> 18:43.248
Babe?

18:43.250 --> 18:46.081
Hey, what are you doing
in here?

18:46.083 --> 18:48.831
Hey. Moody?

18:48.833 --> 18:51.748
Come on. This ain't
like you, is it?

18:51.750 --> 18:53.748
Looking like you're about
to burst into tears.

18:53.750 --> 18:54.915
Come on.

18:57.333 --> 18:59.456
- Sulkin'?
- I'm not sulkin'.

18:59.458 --> 19:01.416
Sulking
in the baby's room.

19:02.750 --> 19:04.623
Where's my girl?

19:04.625 --> 19:06.413
Where's my happy girl?

19:06.415 --> 19:08.248
Come on.

19:08.250 --> 19:10.208
We haven't done it
in here, have we?

19:11.625 --> 19:12.623
Have we done it in here?

19:12.625 --> 19:13.706
We did it
when we got the place.

19:13.708 --> 19:15.831
- Mark.
- Didn't we?

19:15.833 --> 19:17.791
- No.
- Come on.

19:18.540 --> 19:19.956
Don't..

19:19.958 --> 19:22.288
Mark, I don't want to.

19:22.290 --> 19:23.875
Alright, I'm jokin'.

19:25.125 --> 19:26.290
Don't.

19:27.958 --> 19:29.166

Well, you're proper, you're

19:47.915 --> 19:49.125
Yeah.

19:57.333 --> 19:59.163
Oh, shit.

19:59.165 --> 20:01.082
Am I being a mug?

20:03.540 --> 20:04.665
Oi.

20:08.540 --> 20:11.498
You met someone, eh?

20:11.500 --> 20:12.875
- Mark!
- Eh?

20:14.833 --> 20:17.623
I can't believe
you've just asked me that.

20:17.625 --> 20:18.706
I haven't met anyone.

20:18.708 --> 20:20.913
I, I haven't got time
to meet anyone.

20:20.915 --> 20:23.331
I don't meet anyone ever.

20:23.333 --> 20:25.831
I don't go out, do I?

20:25.833 --> 20:27.706
- I don't actually leave.
- Alright.

20:27.708 --> 20:29.373
Uh, what? Who?
Like the... the... the...

20:29.375 --> 20:30.373
Alright, alright,
alright...

20:30.375 --> 20:31.623
The plumber guy that fixed

20:31.625 --> 20:34.163
the dishwasher
the other day.

20:34.165 --> 20:36.665
Alright, I'm sorry. I shouldn't
have said that. I'm sorry.

20:37.915 --> 20:39.123
I can't believe
you asked me that...

20:39.125 --> 20:40.998
I'm sorry.
I said I'm sorry.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.915
I didn't mean that.

20:44.208 --> 20:46.456
I'm trying to work out..

20:46.458 --> 20:48.541
Look at it, look at it
from my point, right?

20:49.750 --> 20:50.831
It's Saturday.

20:50.833 --> 20:52.998
It's my one
of my only days off

20:53.000 --> 20:55.706
and you're...
you're cryin'.

20:55.708 --> 20:57.666
It's a bit weird,
isn't it?

21:01.458 --> 21:03.123
I'm not seeing
anyone else, Mark.

21:03.125 --> 21:04.581
Alright,
I didn't mean that.

21:04.583 --> 21:06.541
I'm just trying to work
out what's going on.

21:11.833 --> 21:12.958
That's nice.

21:17.375 --> 21:20.165
Are you coming back or are you
just walkin' out of the room?

21:26.915 --> 21:28.581
You've just walked away
from me.

21:28.583 --> 21:29.748
You've just walk,
you've just turned

21:29.750 --> 21:31.373
your back on me and come
into another room.

21:31.375 --> 21:32.873
I don't wanna be
around you...

21:32.875 --> 21:34.788
No, I'm trying to find out
what is wrong with you.

21:34.790 --> 21:36.750
Don't fucking walk away
from me.

21:40.415 --> 21:41.375
Don't.

21:45.583 --> 21:46.913
No, I don't know why, but
you would have thought

21:46.915 --> 21:48.038
you'd bought a car
like that, it would have

21:48.040 --> 21:49.831
come with it,
standard, but no.

21:49.833 --> 21:51.163
Hot dogs there.

21:51.165 --> 21:54.081
We've got sausages,
little sausages.

21:54.083 --> 21:55.663
I've come to the shop.

21:55.665 --> 21:57.081
I will need
some tomato ketchup

21:57.083 --> 21:59.831
and some mustard 'cause
mommy's forgotten to buy it.

21:59.833 --> 22:01.788
- Is there any mustard?
- No, I just brought some out.

22:01.790 --> 22:03.123
Thank you.

22:06.790 --> 22:08.000
Nice.

22:10.375 --> 22:11.456
Come on, love. Charlotte.

22:11.458 --> 22:12.456
No.

22:15.958 --> 22:17.875
- Who's hungry?
- Luke wants that one.

22:20.583 --> 22:23.873
Yeah, he trains
about 20 hours a week

22:23.875 --> 22:26.163
so nearly every day
after school

22:26.165 --> 22:28.123
so it's a lot
of runnin' around

22:28.125 --> 22:29.706
and it can be exhausting.

22:29.708 --> 22:32.456
Yeah, so he's just gonna
get to represent London

22:32.458 --> 22:34.998
in, like, a big
regional competition

22:35.000 --> 22:37.623
or national competition,
so..

22:37.625 --> 22:39.748
So, yeah, something
to look forward to.

22:39.750 --> 22:42.248
That's good, isn't it?

22:42.250 --> 22:44.873
Why don't you get up
and have a play with them?

22:44.875 --> 22:46.748
- Eh?
- Come on, Florrie.

22:46.750 --> 22:48.665
Who wants a sausage?

22:51.500 --> 22:54.081
- Didn't needed it.
- Thank you.

22:54.083 --> 22:56.373
Are you not doing
the drinks for me?

22:56.375 --> 22:57.913
- Everyone's got a drink.
- You had a job to do...

22:57.915 --> 22:59.540
Everyone's got drinks.

23:03.708 --> 23:06.206
No, you're not allowed in!

23:06.208 --> 23:07.831
No way.

23:07.833 --> 23:09.331
Do you wanna do something?

23:09.333 --> 23:10.623
What?
I'm just chilling out.

23:10.625 --> 23:11.623
Well, they're getting,
they're in chaos...

23:11.625 --> 23:13.206
You always do
the barbecue.

23:13.208 --> 23:16.331
- Yeah, I do...
- You won't let, you won't let me do it.

23:16.333 --> 23:17.581
I don't want you
doing the barbecue.

23:17.583 --> 23:18.623
I want you to make sure
they've all got..

23:18.625 --> 23:19.831
No one's got a drink
on them.

23:19.833 --> 23:21.123
And the kids
are going mental.

23:21.125 --> 23:23.831
Yeah, I know. Well,
the kids are alright.

23:23.833 --> 23:25.873
Do you want.. Anyone want more drinks?
Are you all...

23:25.875 --> 23:26.873
No, I just got one.
Thanks.

23:26.875 --> 23:28.123
You've got one.
Are you alright?

23:28.125 --> 23:29.248
Um, I could have
another one, please.

23:29.250 --> 23:30.623
- Yeah?
- No!

23:30.625 --> 23:32.540
- Thank you.
- No, wait, Florrie.

23:34.040 --> 23:36.373
- Is it garlic?
- Hummus is garlic.

23:36.375 --> 23:39.163
I'm putting..

23:39.165 --> 23:41.082
How are you gonna know
you don't like it?

23:46.040 --> 23:47.831
This don't have
to be our house.

23:47.833 --> 23:50.208
Yeah, I do like hummus.
Let me have..

23:58.208 --> 24:00.125
Kids,
do you want burgers?

24:01.500 --> 24:03.498
Who wants burgers?

24:07.750 --> 24:10.081
Get one of the kids
to try it first.

24:10.083 --> 24:12.248
The old trick.

24:32.915 --> 24:35.413
Well, I gave it to you.

24:35.415 --> 24:36.623
Ted, what are you doing?

24:36.625 --> 24:37.998
Breaking
your mom's plant?

24:38.000 --> 24:40.250
- Don't do that.
- I need to check it.

25:39.708 --> 25:41.000
Fuckin' hell.

25:55.915 --> 25:57.707
Oh, yeah.

26:00.125 --> 26:01.583
Yeah.

26:06.208 --> 26:07.541
I'm not happy.

26:09.708 --> 26:11.125
Hey?

26:12.833 --> 26:14.416
I'm not happy.

26:21.625 --> 26:22.833
No.

26:25.165 --> 26:27.250
I need to do
something else.

26:29.790 --> 26:32.373
I can't do this anymore.

26:32.375 --> 26:34.375
I'm not happy, Mark.

26:35.583 --> 26:36.833
Hey?

26:59.415 --> 27:00.456
Are you laughin'
or cryin'?

27:00.458 --> 27:02.416
I can't work it out.

27:03.500 --> 27:05.415
Did I do something wrong?

27:08.458 --> 27:09.750
Babe?

27:10.790 --> 27:12.750
I'm going to go
to sleep now.

29:07.083 --> 29:09.913
That's 15 pounds
altogether.

29:09.915 --> 29:11.875
- Lovely. Thank you.
- Thank you.

29:15.915 --> 29:17.623
- Fiver change.
- Thank you.

29:17.625 --> 29:19.623
- Thank you. Bye.
- Bye.

30:23.375 --> 30:25.663
- Alright?
- No.

30:25.665 --> 30:27.957
- Why?
- I'm knackered.

30:30.125 --> 30:32.375
Well, I had a good day.

30:34.375 --> 30:36.498
- Yeah? What's that?
- Yeah.

30:36.500 --> 30:38.581
It's this book
that I got today.

30:38.583 --> 30:40.500
"The Lady
And The Unicorn."

30:43.125 --> 30:45.248
- Do you want one?
- No, I'm alright.

30:45.250 --> 30:47.498
Sounds like a kid's book.

30:47.500 --> 30:50.623
Yeah, no,
it's this book about

30:50.625 --> 30:53.581
um, these tapestries.

30:53.583 --> 30:56.206
Like medieval tapestries
in Pa..

30:56.208 --> 30:57.998
They, like they're hanging
in Paris.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.998
There's 6 of them,
they all represent

31:00.000 --> 31:03.998
different, um, aspects
of the self, like..

31:04.000 --> 31:06.956
Anyway... I saw this book

31:06.958 --> 31:09.956
and then it made me think
what I need to do.

31:09.958 --> 31:11.663
Because I think
I need to, like, get out

31:11.665 --> 31:13.206
and do something
with my life

31:13.208 --> 31:14.538
that's not
just being here.

31:14.540 --> 31:17.500
And I thought maybe I
could do this art course.

31:19.500 --> 31:21.415
What do you think?

31:22.625 --> 31:23.833
What?

31:25.500 --> 31:27.038
I think it would be good.

31:27.040 --> 31:28.913
Why are you crying?

31:28.915 --> 31:30.331
Because I need you
to... to understand...

31:30.333 --> 31:31.831
Come here. Come here.

31:31.833 --> 31:34.748
I do understand.
Come here.

31:34.750 --> 31:36.663
- What's happened today?
- I went..

31:36.665 --> 31:39.538
I actually had
a really nice day.

31:39.540 --> 31:40.665
No.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.538
- I went up London.
- Yeah?

31:43.540 --> 31:46.998
Yeah, and, um,
it was really good.

31:47.000 --> 31:48.288
- Great.
- No, it was really nice.

31:48.290 --> 31:49.623
Yeah.

31:49.625 --> 31:52.206
So, like, even getting
on the train was good.

31:52.208 --> 31:55.788
Just getting out and seeing
all the different people

31:55.790 --> 31:57.331
and all the different
ways they dress and...

31:57.333 --> 31:59.538
Yeah, yeah.

31:59.540 --> 32:01.206
And I was only up there
for a couple of hours

32:01.208 --> 32:04.038
but it just made me
feel good.

32:04.040 --> 32:06.038
Like, it made me
feel really..

32:08.083 --> 32:12.623
So there's this
art, like, academy..

32:12.625 --> 32:14.748
...that do these courses.

32:14.750 --> 32:19.081
So you can do evening ones
or you can do day ones

32:19.083 --> 32:20.873
which is what I thought
I could do

32:20.875 --> 32:22.623
because then, because then

32:22.625 --> 32:25.748
I would be able to get
the kids off to school

32:25.750 --> 32:28.081
get up to London and then
someone could come

32:28.083 --> 32:29.748
and pick them up
and then I could..

32:29.750 --> 32:32.038
It's not, it's not every day.
It's just every..

32:32.040 --> 32:34.038
It depends,
but you can do like..

32:34.040 --> 32:36.163
Depends on how many
sessions you want.

32:36.165 --> 32:38.413
I think I'd need,
like, 10 or so.

32:38.415 --> 32:41.498
And they range between
270 to about 400 pounds.

32:41.500 --> 32:42.583
Jesus.

32:44.250 --> 32:46.500
Yeah, but I think
it's worth it.

32:48.165 --> 32:49.290
Yeah, great.

32:51.040 --> 32:53.415
- It's a really good idea.
- Okay.

32:54.583 --> 32:56.500
So I can enroll then?

32:58.790 --> 33:00.538
They've got this, um

33:00.540 --> 33:04.413
they've got this,
um, open day..

33:04.415 --> 33:05.831
...in a few weeks.

33:05.833 --> 33:07.083
Great.

33:09.583 --> 33:11.623
I don't know yet
which course I wanna do.

33:11.625 --> 33:14.288
I'm not sure.
Maybe the line drawing.

33:14.290 --> 33:15.873
'Cause I always
was quite good at that.

33:15.875 --> 33:18.038
Or I could do..

33:18.040 --> 33:19.663
Maybe I could do
a tapestry

33:19.665 --> 33:21.956
or a textiles course,
I don't know.

33:21.958 --> 33:23.875
Whatever makes you happy.

33:29.125 --> 33:30.333
Any food?

33:33.915 --> 33:35.456
You said you didn't want
any dinner so I didn't...

33:35.458 --> 33:37.416
Yeah, I said that earlier,
didn't I?

34:08.248 --> 34:11.581
"Never have I seen her
so beautiful.

34:11.583 --> 34:13.998
Her hairstyle
is strange indeed.

34:16.498 --> 34:17.914
Two plaits gathered
at the front

34:17.916 --> 34:19.496
and tied together
on top of her head

34:19.498 --> 34:22.664
splaying out from the
knot like a short plume

34:22.666 --> 34:24.496
looking vexed."

34:24.498 --> 34:25.664
Vexed.

34:25.666 --> 34:27.996
"The accepted view
is that the tapestries

34:27.998 --> 34:29.871
depict the 5 senses

34:29.873 --> 34:31.706
to which is added
a 6th sense

34:31.708 --> 34:34.206
probably indicating
moral judgement."

34:34.208 --> 34:37.123
I don't get this.

34:41.291 --> 34:43.041
Am I just thick?

34:44.916 --> 34:47.208
'Cause I don't do things
like this.

34:48.958 --> 34:50.873
I don't go to galleries
and that.

34:56.083 --> 34:58.041
No, don't walk off.

35:01.041 --> 35:02.000
Babe.

35:15.625 --> 35:16.958
Night, babe.

35:27.000 --> 35:28.498
It's nice that, isn't it?

35:28.500 --> 35:29.583
Yeah.

35:33.791 --> 35:35.083
I mean that.

35:38.916 --> 35:41.831
You know,
I'm gonna actually make...

35:41.833 --> 35:42.998
Sorry.

35:43.000 --> 35:45.206
There you go.
Are you ready to order?

35:45.208 --> 35:46.623
- Yes.
- Yeah.

35:46.625 --> 35:49.998
Um, can I have
the butternut squash...

35:50.000 --> 35:51.539
- Squash. Followed by?
- ...please?

35:51.541 --> 35:55.123
And then the, um,
the peppers, please.

35:55.125 --> 35:56.789
- Good.
- Thank you.

35:56.791 --> 35:58.539
Which one you having
for the first one?

35:58.541 --> 35:59.956
- Butternut squash.
- I'll have that.

35:59.958 --> 36:01.373
- Yeah, same again?
- Yeah.

36:01.375 --> 36:02.914
And for your main?

36:02.916 --> 36:04.456
Uh, I'll have the chicken,
please.

36:04.458 --> 36:06.373
Sure.
Thank you very much then.

36:06.375 --> 36:07.831
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

36:07.833 --> 36:08.873
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

36:08.875 --> 36:10.791
Do you want some water?

36:40.916 --> 36:42.833
I think you're amazing.

36:44.500 --> 36:46.623
You're an amazing mom.

36:46.625 --> 36:47.958
Amazing wife.

36:58.958 --> 37:00.875
And you're beautiful.

37:05.916 --> 37:06.956
Nice being out, innit?

37:06.958 --> 37:08.581
- Mm. It's lovely.
- Do that more.

37:08.583 --> 37:11.248
- Get out of the house.
- Mm.

37:11.250 --> 37:12.333
Yeah.

37:18.333 --> 37:20.666
- Do this more, actually.
- Yep.

37:33.375 --> 37:35.456
- Here we go.
- Oh, thank you.

37:35.458 --> 37:37.623
You're welcome.
Your starters.

37:37.625 --> 37:39.456
- It looks lovely.
- Enjoy your meal.

37:39.458 --> 37:40.873
Thank you.

37:40.875 --> 37:42.998
- What is that?
- It's butternut squash.

37:43.000 --> 37:44.248
Is it carrots?

37:44.250 --> 37:46.625
It looks like carrots,
but it's butternut squash.

40:49.625 --> 40:50.789
Ted.

40:50.791 --> 40:52.706
- Oh, look, mommy's here.
- I'm so sorry.

40:52.708 --> 40:54.123
Hello.

40:54.125 --> 40:55.414
Mommy's very sorry.

40:55.416 --> 40:57.081
I didn't mean to be late,
darling.

40:57.083 --> 40:58.414
- I'm really sorry.
- It's alright.

40:58.416 --> 40:59.748
- Don't worry.
- I didn't mean it.

40:59.750 --> 41:01.914
Come on,
let's go and get Florrie.

41:01.916 --> 41:03.623
Thank you. So sorry.
Thank you.

41:03.625 --> 41:06.706
Alright, come on, come on.
Let's go and get Florrie.

41:06.708 --> 41:08.581
Yeah, we're going to go
and find her.

41:10.250 --> 41:12.208
Come on, come on, come on.
Let's go and get Florrie.

41:14.416 --> 41:17.331
- There's Florrie. Look.
- Here's mommy.

41:17.333 --> 41:21.456
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, who's this come to get you?

41:21.458 --> 41:23.206
- I'm so sorry.
- That's fine. She's been fine.

41:23.208 --> 41:24.623
- Has she been good?
- Absolutely fine.

41:24.625 --> 41:27.123
Thank you so much.
You alright, darling?

41:27.125 --> 41:29.373
- See you later.
- Be a good boy. Come on.

41:29.375 --> 41:31.623
We're going home now.

41:31.625 --> 41:33.289
Out you go.
See you later. Bye.

41:33.291 --> 41:34.414
- Sorry. Thank you.
- That's fine.

41:34.416 --> 41:35.914
That's fine. Bye.

41:52.125 --> 41:53.375
You dropped it.

41:56.333 --> 41:57.789
Tidy this up.

42:00.000 --> 42:01.998
Tidy this up.

42:02.000 --> 42:03.414
Put it away.

42:08.541 --> 42:11.164
Who's been playing
with my book?

42:11.166 --> 42:13.164
No one's allowed
to touch my stuff!

42:13.166 --> 42:15.789
And I've had enough of you
fucking idiots!

42:15.791 --> 42:18.708
All you do, you never
fucking listen to me!

42:19.708 --> 42:21.208
Fuck you!

42:44.458 --> 42:47.041
Mommy's really sorry.
Mommy's so sorry.

42:50.791 --> 42:52.375
Mommy's sorry.

43:14.041 --> 43:15.541
I envy you.

43:17.666 --> 43:19.583
A lot of people do,
darlin'.

43:25.791 --> 43:27.708
You're good with the kids.

43:31.666 --> 43:32.916
They like you.

43:36.416 --> 43:38.333
You make them laugh.

43:40.583 --> 43:42.500
"Daddy's home."

43:44.500 --> 43:45.914
You get to play with them.

43:45.916 --> 43:47.248
Yeah, we've talked
about that, haven't we?

43:47.250 --> 43:49.208
- I'm not with them all day.
- They hate me.

43:51.916 --> 43:54.581
Don't be a numpty.
They don't hate you.

43:54.583 --> 43:56.081
They love you.

43:56.083 --> 43:58.456
I can be a joker
'cause I'm out all day.

43:58.458 --> 44:00.666
You have to do
the rules for 'em.

44:02.958 --> 44:05.206
You're a great mom.

44:05.208 --> 44:07.125
You love them to bits.

44:08.375 --> 44:10.581
Hey.

44:10.583 --> 44:11.789
That's what you do
for kids.

44:11.791 --> 44:12.956
You look after them,
you bring them up

44:12.958 --> 44:14.456
and they treat you like
crap most of the time.

44:14.458 --> 44:16.500
That's what happens.
Everyone knows that.

44:18.125 --> 44:19.998
I don't care about them.

44:20.000 --> 44:22.164
Oi, you don't mean that.

44:22.166 --> 44:24.206
You're a mom.
That's what moms do.

44:24.208 --> 44:26.331
I don't care if they don't
finish their dinner.

44:26.333 --> 44:28.123
I don't care
if they fall over.

44:28.125 --> 44:30.123
- Oi, oi, oi, oi.
- I don't care.

44:30.125 --> 44:31.706
I don't care
if they go to school

44:31.708 --> 44:33.498
or if they don't go
to school.

44:33.500 --> 44:35.289
What are you talkin'
about? Stop it.

44:35.291 --> 44:37.958
But I make myself care.
I make myself do it.

44:39.333 --> 44:41.331
I make myself be funny...

44:41.333 --> 44:43.873
- Alright.
- ...and happy.

44:43.875 --> 44:45.331
- Silly...
- Alright.

44:45.333 --> 44:46.583
...like you.

44:49.833 --> 44:52.914
- I think they hate me.
- Shut up.

44:52.916 --> 44:55.331
I think they can feel
what's going on.

44:55.333 --> 44:56.500
Alright.

44:58.000 --> 44:59.916
This has got to stop now.

45:03.750 --> 45:05.083
Goodnight, Mark.

45:20.083 --> 45:21.333
It's a phase.

45:25.375 --> 45:27.333
It's just a phase.

45:31.000 --> 45:33.998
Everybody goes
through it.

45:34.000 --> 45:36.706
But it's not something
off the telly.

45:36.708 --> 45:38.125
It's real life.

45:41.875 --> 45:43.791
I mean, what do you think
you're gonna do?

45:45.833 --> 45:48.164
Maybe do a... a course
or something.

45:48.166 --> 45:50.206
- Get a job?
- Y... You're 30 now.

45:50.208 --> 45:52.081
You've left that too late.

45:52.083 --> 45:54.373
They do, like, higher..

45:54.375 --> 45:57.289
...uh, after work ones
and stuff.

45:57.291 --> 45:58.373
After work, like what?

45:58.375 --> 46:01.623
After, you know,
after school ones.

46:05.958 --> 46:08.206
And who's gonna look
after the kids then?

46:08.208 --> 46:09.998
Mark.

46:10.000 --> 46:12.623
He can't do that.

46:12.625 --> 46:14.456
Do you really think a man
can bring up two kids

46:14.458 --> 46:15.623
like that on his own?

46:15.625 --> 46:17.541
He'll be out of there
like a shot.

46:19.041 --> 46:20.581
Have you thought
about that?

46:20.583 --> 46:21.956
You could look after them.

46:21.958 --> 46:23.206
I couldn't look after them.

46:23.208 --> 46:25.039
You know how many hours
I work down The Somerset.

46:25.041 --> 46:26.958
I can't look after them.

46:30.333 --> 46:32.914
It's a phase.

46:32.916 --> 46:34.789
That's all it is.
It's just a phase.

46:34.791 --> 46:36.373
You're gonna get
through it.

46:36.375 --> 46:38.958
Kids are hard.
I told you that.

46:40.458 --> 46:41.750
I should know.

46:43.666 --> 46:46.039
I had to do it
all on my own.

46:46.041 --> 46:48.331
You've got him..

46:48.333 --> 46:50.206
...bringing in good money.

46:50.208 --> 46:51.748
You've got two cars.

46:51.750 --> 46:53.914
Got a beautiful house.
You've got a conservatory.

46:53.916 --> 46:55.916
You've got the kids
in the school up the road.

46:57.375 --> 46:59.291
You've got it made.

47:12.000 --> 47:13.958
Can you do something?

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
Can you do something?

47:20.791 --> 47:22.123
I'm gonna go.

47:28.291 --> 47:30.373
Ted, I'm gonna go to work.

47:30.375 --> 47:32.039
See you later.

47:32.041 --> 47:35.206
Come and polish the lights
for me, Ted. Come on.

47:35.208 --> 47:37.956
Yeah, we can give it
a clean.

47:37.958 --> 47:40.164
Okay. You hold
my hand though, yeah.

47:40.166 --> 47:41.791
They're his eyes.

47:43.833 --> 47:45.083
And a nose.

47:46.666 --> 47:48.498
Not a nose.

47:48.500 --> 47:51.083
- Not a nose.
- It is. That's his nose.

47:53.291 --> 47:54.831
Give it a flower.

47:54.833 --> 47:56.750
- Put it on there.
- Okay.

47:59.000 --> 48:00.958
That's it. Good boy.

48:27.541 --> 48:28.791
Babe?

48:36.208 --> 48:37.333
Babe?

48:40.333 --> 48:42.456
Oh, come on.

48:42.458 --> 48:43.708
Come here.

48:49.708 --> 48:51.625
Please don't do this.

48:53.541 --> 48:54.833
Please.

48:56.125 --> 48:57.414
I can't feel
like this anymore.

48:57.416 --> 48:59.039
Please say something.
I'll do anything for you.

48:59.041 --> 49:00.623
You know I'd do anything
for you, don't you?

49:00.625 --> 49:03.123
- No. I can't do it.
- Please, please.

49:03.125 --> 49:06.206
Shh. What do you mean
you can't do it?

49:06.208 --> 49:08.414
What do you want me
to do for you, eh?

49:08.416 --> 49:11.248
I'll do anything. I'll change.
I'll be different.

49:11.250 --> 49:13.581
I don't care.
I'll do whatever you want.

49:13.583 --> 49:15.581
Do you wanna move?
Sell the house?

49:15.583 --> 49:17.664
Do something different?
I'll do anything for you.

49:17.666 --> 49:20.206
I can't, I can't
let this break us apart.

49:20.208 --> 49:22.581
It's too good. Isn't it?

49:22.583 --> 49:24.414
- Think of our little kids, eh?
- Mark.

49:24.416 --> 49:25.706
Think of their
little faces.

49:25.708 --> 49:27.250
- No.
- Please.

49:28.416 --> 49:29.581
Look at me.

49:29.583 --> 49:31.500
Please, look at me.
Please?

49:33.125 --> 49:35.623
It's not nice, is it?

49:35.625 --> 49:37.206
Waking up every day
feeling like this.

49:37.208 --> 49:39.914
Let's sort it out.

49:39.916 --> 49:41.831
Can we?

49:41.833 --> 49:43.750
Can we sort it out?

49:45.958 --> 49:48.873
- Baby?
- I can't, Mark.

49:48.875 --> 49:49.998
Please,
just say something.

49:50.000 --> 49:52.289
Just stop fucking,
don't fucking clean up!

49:52.291 --> 49:53.789
Leave the fucking dishes

49:53.791 --> 49:56.125

conversation with you!

49:57.625 --> 49:59.708
- Yes?

50:01.958 --> 50:04.123
Are we gonna
make this better?

50:04.125 --> 50:05.164
- Yeah...
- Yeah.

50:05.166 --> 50:07.789
How are we gonna
make it better?

50:07.791 --> 50:09.248
Just fucking talk to me,
please.

50:09.250 --> 50:10.373
I can't!

50:10.375 --> 50:12.791
Mark, please get off.

50:14.291 --> 50:16.208
What do you want?

50:17.583 --> 50:19.125
Eh?

50:20.791 --> 50:23.123
Is this what you want?

50:23.125 --> 50:25.500
Is this it? Is this what
you fucking care about?

50:28.083 --> 50:29.748
Art? You wanna do
some fucking art?

50:29.750 --> 50:31.164
Do some fucking art!

50:31.166 --> 50:33.541
Do fucking art!

50:51.416 --> 50:53.333
I didn't mean to do that.

50:57.833 --> 50:59.791
I didn't mean to do that.

51:04.708 --> 51:06.666
I just need you
to tell me what to do.

51:08.666 --> 51:11.166
I'll do it. I just need you

01:13:10.166 --> 01:13:12.164
Because you're beautiful.

01:13:12.166 --> 01:13:13.955
And the light
is great, so..

01:13:13.957 --> 01:13:15.415
Yeah.

01:13:16.916 --> 01:13:18.750
Where you from?

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.830
- I'm from London.
- Uh-huh.

01:13:23.832 --> 01:13:25.830
- You?
- I'm from here.

01:13:25.832 --> 01:13:27.750
- From Paris?
- Yeah.

01:13:29.832 --> 01:13:31.248
Did you grow up in Paris?

01:13:31.250 --> 01:13:33.123
- Sorry.
- Did you grow up in Paris?

01:13:33.125 --> 01:13:36.539
- Yes.
- Wow. That's lucky.

01:13:36.541 --> 01:13:39.123
Did you grow up in London?

01:13:39.125 --> 01:13:43.873
No. I, um, grew up
near London

01:13:43.875 --> 01:13:48.289
and then I moved to London
when I was 18.

01:13:48.291 --> 01:13:50.873
- Mm-hmm.
- For my studies.

01:13:50.875 --> 01:13:53.873
And what do you do?

01:13:53.875 --> 01:13:55.041
Um..

01:13:56.500 --> 01:13:58.582
I work for a, um..

01:14:00.166 --> 01:14:02.830
...a commercial company.

01:14:02.832 --> 01:14:04.705
- Oh. Really?
- Yeah.

01:14:05.875 --> 01:14:06.873
Yeah.

01:14:06.875 --> 01:14:07.955
- Me too.
- Do you?

01:14:07.957 --> 01:14:09.830
Sometimes, yeah,
as a photographer.

01:14:09.832 --> 01:14:11.580
Ah, okay.

01:14:11.582 --> 01:14:13.039
I don't like it so much.

01:14:13.041 --> 01:14:14.873
Why not?

01:14:14.875 --> 01:14:18.830
I don't know, it's just
I prefer street photo.

01:14:18.832 --> 01:14:19.914
- Yeah.
- You know?

01:14:19.916 --> 01:14:21.164
You take a lot of photos.

01:14:21.166 --> 01:14:22.580
Of you.
Sorry. It's, uh...

01:14:22.582 --> 01:14:23.623
It's okay.

01:14:23.625 --> 01:14:26.455
You wanna take a coffee
or something?

01:14:26.457 --> 01:14:27.832
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:14:30.291 --> 01:14:33.039
- Now? Okay.
- Yeah. Why not?

01:14:33.041 --> 01:14:35.914
Um, what's your name,
by the way?

01:14:35.916 --> 01:14:38.205
- Sam.
- Sam. Philippe.

01:14:38.207 --> 01:14:40.125
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

01:14:43.541 --> 01:14:46.998
So did you always
want to be a photographer?

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.455
Um, no.

01:14:49.457 --> 01:14:51.664
What did you want to do?

01:14:51.666 --> 01:14:54.623
- This one is nice, huh?
- Hm.

01:14:54.625 --> 01:14:57.914
Um, I start drawing

01:14:57.916 --> 01:15:03.666
and, uh, I did a first,
uh, work, uh..

01:15:05.375 --> 01:15:09.455
It's weird, but, uh,
about transsexuals.

01:15:09.457 --> 01:15:10.873
- Okay.
- Yeah? You understand?

01:15:10.875 --> 01:15:11.914
And, uh...

01:15:11.916 --> 01:15:14.330
Like, it makes you feel

01:15:14.332 --> 01:15:16.205
like, alive when you take

01:15:16.207 --> 01:15:17.705
when you capture
something?

01:15:17.707 --> 01:15:19.498
Uh, don't know,
it's just, um

01:15:19.500 --> 01:15:20.955
uh, the way I am.

01:15:20.957 --> 01:15:23.082
- I need to do that.
- Yeah.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:25.830
- It's so beautiful.
- It is.

01:15:25.832 --> 01:15:27.748
- I've never seen a...
- Really?

01:15:27.750 --> 01:15:29.873
...garden like that. Yeah.

01:15:29.875 --> 01:15:31.830
You don't have any garden
like that in London?

01:15:31.832 --> 01:15:35.498
No, not where everything
is exact like that.

01:15:35.500 --> 01:15:38.080
Uh, I had
a very good professor.

01:15:38.082 --> 01:15:39.498
- Teacher?
- Teacher, yeah.

01:15:39.500 --> 01:15:41.498
And, uh, he decided

01:15:41.500 --> 01:15:43.957
to bring me
in the art school..

01:15:45.582 --> 01:15:48.623
...and realized that, uh

01:15:48.625 --> 01:15:50.875
it was something
very important for me.

01:15:54.166 --> 01:15:55.664
I have a question.

01:15:55.666 --> 01:15:58.539
- Okay.
- Yeah.

01:15:58.541 --> 01:16:00.455
Sounds stupid, I know.

01:16:00.457 --> 01:16:02.707
- It's alright.
- Um..

01:16:05.957 --> 01:16:08.040
Do you have someone?

01:16:10.082 --> 01:16:11.332
Yeah?

01:16:14.500 --> 01:16:15.750
No.

01:16:17.500 --> 01:16:19.705
- I don't believe you.
- Why?

01:16:19.707 --> 01:16:22.080
I don't know.

01:16:22.082 --> 01:16:23.540
First..

01:16:25.750 --> 01:16:27.332
You just, um..

01:16:29.041 --> 01:16:31.539
...broke up or..

01:16:31.541 --> 01:16:34.664
I don't know,
it's just so weird.

01:16:34.666 --> 01:16:38.914
Y... You are alone,
you follow me.

01:16:38.916 --> 01:16:41.208
No, you follow me.

01:16:43.166 --> 01:16:45.373
Yeah, that's true.

01:16:45.375 --> 01:16:46.539
No, I... I'm..

01:16:46.541 --> 01:16:48.748
I don't have time
for a boyfriend, so.

01:16:48.750 --> 01:16:50.207
Okay.

01:16:51.832 --> 01:16:53.748
- Me neither.
- Really?

01:16:53.750 --> 01:16:54.830
For girlfriend?

01:16:57.750 --> 01:17:00.750
- You don't have time?
- Not so much.

01:17:03.582 --> 01:17:04.790
So..

01:17:07.250 --> 01:17:09.705
...have you ever been married
or anything like that?

01:17:09.707 --> 01:17:10.748
No.

01:17:10.750 --> 01:17:12.125
- Never?
- No.

01:17:13.750 --> 01:17:15.748
- You don't have children?
- No.

01:17:15.750 --> 01:17:18.039
What?

01:17:18.041 --> 01:17:20.414
- I'm alone.
- You are totally alone.

01:17:20.416 --> 01:17:21.914
Yeah. And you?

01:17:21.916 --> 01:17:23.705
- Me too.
- You too?

01:17:23.707 --> 01:17:24.875
So..

01:17:26.582 --> 01:17:28.332
...it's amazing,
it's, uh..

01:17:31.166 --> 01:17:32.705
- Sorry.
- No, no. Okay, okay.

01:17:32.707 --> 01:17:35.289
- I can't believe it.
- No, it's right.

01:17:35.291 --> 01:17:37.375
So maybe it's
super important that we..

01:17:38.957 --> 01:17:41.789
...live in now.

01:17:41.791 --> 01:17:42.916
No?

01:17:44.541 --> 01:17:46.125
Who knows?

01:17:51.457 --> 01:17:53.207
You're sad.

01:17:54.791 --> 01:17:56.375
Why is that?

01:17:57.750 --> 01:17:59.332
I'm not.

01:18:00.457 --> 01:18:02.750
- I'm not sad.
- Really?

01:18:07.916 --> 01:18:12.080
You have a kind
of sad thing in your eyes.

01:18:12.082 --> 01:18:14.998
It's just the way I look.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:16.666
Maybe.

01:18:18.125 --> 01:18:19.623
- Let's walk.
- Mm-hmm.

01:18:19.625 --> 01:18:21.041
- Breathe.
- Mm.

01:22:35.541 --> 01:22:37.458
Excuse me.

01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:07.041
Who was that?

01:23:10.875 --> 01:23:12.375
Nothing important.

01:23:14.332 --> 01:23:16.664
Why didn't you answer?

01:23:16.666 --> 01:23:19.289
Because I didn't want to.

01:23:23.666 --> 01:23:26.080
- What?
- Who's that baby?

01:23:26.082 --> 01:23:27.455
What? The baby?

01:23:27.457 --> 01:23:28.873
Who... Who's the baby?

01:23:28.875 --> 01:23:31.625
- Which baby?
- The baby in the picture.

01:23:33.166 --> 01:23:34.164
On the phone.

01:23:35.750 --> 01:23:37.000
Hm?

01:23:40.375 --> 01:23:42.123
- Who is it?
- That's my baby.

01:23:42.125 --> 01:23:43.791
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:23:48.207 --> 01:23:49.582
How old?

01:23:51.666 --> 01:23:53.998
How old is the baby?

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.082
She's not a baby.
She's 3.

01:24:10.582 --> 01:24:12.998
Is that your wife?

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:14.705
Yes.

01:24:14.707 --> 01:24:16.415
- Mm.
- Hm.

01:24:18.082 --> 01:24:20.330
You don't love her?

01:24:20.332 --> 01:24:23.498
It's not so clear.

01:24:25.666 --> 01:24:28.708
But, yeah,
we will probably..

01:24:31.207 --> 01:24:32.832
...divorced.

01:24:35.207 --> 01:24:36.957
Come on, Sam.

01:24:38.957 --> 01:24:41.539
I really like you.

01:24:41.541 --> 01:24:43.125
I'm sorry.

01:24:44.457 --> 01:24:46.539
Sorry, really.

01:24:46.541 --> 01:24:48.539
I want you to go.

01:24:48.541 --> 01:24:50.541
It's wrong what you did.

01:24:54.791 --> 01:24:56.708
Okay, okay.

01:25:06.791 --> 01:25:09.039
Can we see
each other again?

01:25:09.041 --> 01:25:10.208
No.

01:26:55.166 --> 01:26:58.123
Can you
pick up the phone, please?

01:26:58.125 --> 01:26:59.414
Can you answer
the phone, please?

01:26:59.416 --> 01:27:01.330
This isn't fair. Please.

01:27:01.332 --> 01:27:02.664
Where are you now?

01:27:02.666 --> 01:27:03.873
Tara, pick up the phone.

01:27:03.875 --> 01:27:05.748
Tell me where you are.
I'll come and get you.

01:27:05.750 --> 01:27:07.664
Look, love, uh

01:27:07.666 --> 01:27:09.248
I don't know
what's going on here

01:27:09.250 --> 01:27:11.123
but Mark's frantic.

01:27:11.125 --> 01:27:12.748
Please, please, please

01:27:12.750 --> 01:27:15.873
turn your phone on,
please.

01:27:15.875 --> 01:27:17.123
Tara, I'm really worried.

01:27:17.125 --> 01:27:18.830
Tara, it's mom.

01:27:18.832 --> 01:27:20.623
Look, come on.
Pick up the phone.

01:27:20.625 --> 01:27:23.039
Just text me so that
I know you're alright.

01:27:23.041 --> 01:27:25.123
Just pick up the phone.
Just c... call me back.

01:27:25.125 --> 01:27:26.539
Oh, look,
do you want to speak

01:27:26.541 --> 01:27:27.998
to mommy on the phone?

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:29.373
Pick the phone up.

01:27:29.375 --> 01:27:30.873
Say hello now.
Yeah, say..

01:27:30.875 --> 01:27:32.373
Can you say mommy,
please come back home?

01:27:32.375 --> 01:27:33.873
Please come back
because we miss you.

01:27:33.875 --> 01:27:35.080
Come on. Come back.

01:27:35.082 --> 01:27:36.955
- Please.
- Please.

01:27:36.957 --> 01:27:38.539
- Pretty, pretty please.
- I don't know what to say.

01:27:38.541 --> 01:27:40.748
What have we done
to make you do this?

01:27:40.750 --> 01:27:43.416
- We love you, please.
- We love you, Mommy.

01:27:45.541 --> 01:27:47.833
Baby, look, please,
just answer the phone.

01:27:49.625 --> 01:27:51.498
- Please, darling.
- Please.

01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:53.039
Please don't break..

01:27:53.041 --> 01:27:54.539
You know I don't mean any
of those things I say.

01:27:54.541 --> 01:27:55.748
I'm just stressed.

01:29:29.625 --> 01:29:31.541
How are you feeling?

01:29:33.416 --> 01:29:34.666
Better.

01:29:42.291 --> 01:29:43.750
Have some tea.

01:29:46.291 --> 01:29:47.500
Thank you.

01:29:48.791 --> 01:29:51.041
You slept quite well.

01:29:54.832 --> 01:29:57.664
You know, I usually
don't bring people home.

01:29:57.666 --> 01:30:01.248
But, uh, last night
when I, I saw you there

01:30:01.250 --> 01:30:03.248
it was just heartbreaking.

01:30:03.250 --> 01:30:05.998
You looked so unhappy.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.582
I couldn't just
pass by and..

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:16.707
And now..

01:30:20.207 --> 01:30:22.165
...what are you
going to do?

01:30:30.582 --> 01:30:33.580
I really think
you should..

01:30:33.582 --> 01:30:35.625
...you should call
your husband.

01:30:37.250 --> 01:30:39.250
Afraid to call him.

01:30:40.332 --> 01:30:41.582
Why?

01:30:45.416 --> 01:30:47.541
Because then I have to..

01:30:50.125 --> 01:30:52.539
...confront the situation.

01:30:52.541 --> 01:30:54.080
And if you don't
call him, you think

01:30:54.082 --> 01:30:56.580
you can't confront it?

01:30:56.582 --> 01:30:58.748
Mm.

01:30:58.750 --> 01:31:01.750
So, please,
definitely call him.

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.748
Sometimes we need
more courage to stay

01:31:08.750 --> 01:31:10.041
than to leave.

01:31:11.625 --> 01:31:13.582
I think it's tough
for a woman.

01:31:15.750 --> 01:31:16.748
For a man too.

01:31:16.750 --> 01:31:18.750
But for a woman, uh..

01:31:20.457 --> 01:31:23.330
...being free and..

01:31:23.332 --> 01:31:25.457
...being married,
it's contradictory.

01:31:31.250 --> 01:31:33.125
Protection is... is..

01:31:34.457 --> 01:31:35.625
...lovely.

01:31:38.541 --> 01:31:41.625
But too much security
is also very boring.

01:31:46.332 --> 01:31:48.290
And when
you have children..

01:31:51.250 --> 01:31:53.166
- That's something else.
- Hm.

01:31:54.916 --> 01:31:56.330
You will feel so good

01:31:56.332 --> 01:31:58.290
once you have
your decision.

01:32:00.666 --> 01:32:04.875
And then you'll get close
to who you really are.

01:32:06.875 --> 01:32:08.498
And then
that's the beauty of it.

01:32:08.500 --> 01:32:10.000
Freedom comes.

01:32:12.291 --> 01:32:13.914
Change completely
your life,

01:32:13.916 --> 01:32:16.333
but try to change it
with him.

01:32:18.625 --> 01:32:19.873
And if it doesn't work

01:32:19.875 --> 01:32:21.832
then change it
without him.

01:32:54.875 --> 01:32:56.707
Ahem.

01:36:14.541 --> 01:36:16.539
Stop!

01:36:16.541 --> 01:36:18.541
You're gonna get caught!

01:36:20.416 --> 01:36:22.708
You're gonna
get caught, Mommy.
