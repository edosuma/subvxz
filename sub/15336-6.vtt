42:27.879 --> 42:29.715
You're all right, too.

42:33.719 --> 42:36.421
Hurry up!

42:36.454 --> 42:40.525
* They say I don't know
if a broken heart can heal *

42:40.558 --> 42:44.863
* But not a heart
made of Sheffield Steel *

42:44.896 --> 42:46.865
Tom.

42:46.898 --> 42:49.534
* Sheffield Steel
Tom.

42:49.567 --> 42:52.437
* Tempered and true

42:52.470 --> 42:54.773
* More than I

42:54.806 --> 42:57.375
* I could say for you

42:57.408 --> 43:00.045
* You've touched my heart

43:00.078 --> 43:03.548
* And you made me feel

43:03.581 --> 43:09.821
* Your knife forged out
of Sheffield Steel **
