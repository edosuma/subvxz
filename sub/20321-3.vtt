00:12.266 --> 00:14.734
What?

00:14.802 --> 00:17.169
You're not talking me
out of this.

00:17.237 --> 00:18.805
Stop harassing me.

00:18.873 --> 00:21.708
You call me again,
I'm going to the police.

00:25.111 --> 00:26.779
I said not to call!

00:26.846 --> 00:29.247
Wow. Nice chatting with you
too, Victoria.

00:29.315 --> 00:33.184
Tia. Sorry, I thought you were
someone else.

00:33.252 --> 00:35.487
Are you mad at this person
'cause they forgot to meet you

00:35.555 --> 00:37.656
for drinks like a certain friend
did with me?

00:37.724 --> 00:40.157
- Oh, my God, was that tonight?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

00:40.225 --> 00:42.960
I am so sorry, Tia.

00:43.028 --> 00:45.930
It's just, you know, it's been
a crazy couple of days at work.

00:45.997 --> 00:48.265
- Is it the Barret article?
- <i>Yeah, it's complicated.</i>

00:48.333 --> 00:50.868
Look, can I call you back when
I get things straightened out?

00:50.936 --> 00:53.971
- Are you gonna forget?
- No, no, this time it's gonna

00:54.039 --> 00:56.272
- be for victory drinks.
- <i>All right, well,</i>

00:56.340 --> 00:58.708
- I'm looking forward to it.
<i>- Ok, ciao.</i>

00:58.776 --> 01:00.343
Bye.

01:08.385 --> 01:11.119
Son of a bitch.

01:35.143 --> 01:37.445
I'm glad I was free
to be your backup plan.

01:37.513 --> 01:39.848
Don't worry, you're never
second choice.

01:39.915 --> 01:42.216
She say why she couldn't
make it?

01:42.284 --> 01:45.986
No, I don't know, I guess
she was just working too hard.

01:46.053 --> 01:48.388
Anyway, I'm sorry,
it must be boring,

01:48.456 --> 01:50.390
talking about this person
you don't even know.

01:50.458 --> 01:52.526
Are you kidding me? I love
this whole "my friends are crazy

01:52.594 --> 01:55.362
but you're gonna learn to
love 'em" phase.

01:55.429 --> 01:57.831
All right, so, how about
our backup plan...

01:57.899 --> 02:00.099
- Yeah.
- we start with some Sushi

02:00.166 --> 02:02.191
- and then see where it goes?
- That's a great idea.

02:02.311 --> 02:03.222
All right.

02:14.080 --> 02:15.514
Oh, my God.

02:15.581 --> 02:17.448
Someone call 911!

02:36.456 --> 02:38.191
Hello.

02:38.258 --> 02:40.759
Everybody decent?
Hey.

02:40.793 --> 02:43.929
Hey. I'm just bringing back
your iron. What do you think?

02:43.996 --> 02:45.803
Yeah, looks nice.
Put it anywhere you want.

02:45.923 --> 02:46.903
How was last night?

02:47.023 --> 02:48.767
- Very good. You?
- Oh,

02:48.835 --> 02:51.502
it was great. Sandy came over,
she cooked, overcooked,

02:51.570 --> 02:53.538
cajun style, I guess.

02:53.606 --> 02:57.341
And we fell asleep on the couch
watching <i>Mob Wives,</i> so, yeah.

02:57.408 --> 02:59.844
- Domestic bliss.
- Absolutely.

02:59.911 --> 03:01.879
Tia didn't stay over last night?

03:01.947 --> 03:04.715
No, no, no, no.
We're taking it nice and slow.

03:04.783 --> 03:06.884
Well, I figured now that
you're dating someone

03:06.952 --> 03:10.121
seriously, you'd wanna make hay
while the sun's shining, you know?

03:10.241 --> 03:11.477
You're a farmer now?

03:11.597 --> 03:13.522
Actually, turks make excellent farmers,
yeah. It's in my blood.

03:13.590 --> 03:16.015
I could snap my fingers and a fig
tree would pop right up.

03:16.135 --> 03:16.820
Get out.

03:16.940 --> 03:18.194
Want me to do it?
I could do it right now.

03:18.262 --> 03:20.263
- Hey. What's up?
- Toby, oh, my God, I need you

03:20.330 --> 03:23.098
to meet me at St. Luke's. What
are you doing in the hospital?

03:23.166 --> 03:25.067
- No, it's Victoria. She's hurt.
- All right. I'm on my way.

03:25.135 --> 03:28.594
Tia's friend's in the hospital.
I gotta go.

03:43.952 --> 03:47.121
Hey, Tia, what happened?

03:47.189 --> 03:49.758
The police called me
this morning.

03:49.825 --> 03:52.193
I guess I was down
as her emergency contact.

03:52.261 --> 03:54.728
She fell
from her apartment balcony.

03:54.796 --> 03:57.964
- How'd she fall?
- They think she jumped.

03:58.032 --> 03:59.466
Hey.

03:59.534 --> 04:01.635
So, uh, I just spoke
with the surgeon.

04:01.703 --> 04:03.637
Victoria's broken
a number of bones,

04:03.705 --> 04:05.439
has some internal bleeding,

04:05.507 --> 04:08.241
extensive bruising,
and serious head trauma.

04:08.310 --> 04:10.343
Oh, my God.
Will she be ok?

04:10.411 --> 04:13.446
They won't know
until they finish operating.

04:13.514 --> 04:17.250
Tia, these are the best
doctors in the country.

04:17.317 --> 04:19.185
She's in good hands.
Toby, I can't believe this.

04:19.253 --> 04:24.324
- She'd never try to kill herself.
- Tia, breathe. Breathe.

04:26.293 --> 04:27.960
This is

04:28.028 --> 04:30.262
the story she was working on.
It was published today.

04:30.330 --> 04:32.764
- Who is this guy?
- Brad Barret.

04:32.833 --> 04:34.800
Self-made millionaire.
Lives in the lap of luxury.

04:34.868 --> 04:38.037
Victoria broke a story about
how he exploits foreign workers.

04:38.104 --> 04:40.539
He must have been pretty furious
when he read it.

04:40.606 --> 04:43.241
- What are you saying?
- She didn't try

04:43.309 --> 04:45.409
to kill herself.
Someone tried to kill her.

04:45.477 --> 04:48.246
I know it in my gut.
She had enemies.

04:48.314 --> 04:52.583
Metro won't look into this.
Will you?

04:52.651 --> 04:55.019
<i>So, you want the IIB</i>

04:55.087 --> 04:57.487
<i>to investigate a suicide</i>
<i>based on what,</i>

04:57.555 --> 04:59.556
- a hunch?
- It's more than a hunch.

04:59.623 --> 05:01.691
It doesn't make sense Victoria
would attempt suicide.

05:01.759 --> 05:04.694
- Did Victoria suffer from depression?
- Not that I know of, no.

05:04.762 --> 05:08.198
Metro pulled this off her computer.
You'll probably want to take a look.

05:08.266 --> 05:11.168
It's a suicide note written on her
computer? Are you kidding me?

05:11.236 --> 05:13.460
They also found sertraline
in her medicine cabinet.

05:13.580 --> 05:15.002
It's a probable sign
of depression.

05:15.122 --> 05:15.633
Toby

05:15.753 --> 05:17.940
I was a paramedic.
I've seen a lot of suicide notes;

05:18.008 --> 05:21.210
they're always handwritten, and because she
has sertraline it doesn't make her suicidal.

05:21.330 --> 05:21.840
Toby

05:21.960 --> 05:24.413
Tia said Victoria had no
history of suicide attempts.

05:24.481 --> 05:28.117
Will you let me finish? This is not a case
that would normally fall under our purview.

05:28.185 --> 05:30.385
But if you've got an instinct
about it, go for it.

05:30.452 --> 05:33.118
However, if you're gonna
open a file on it,

05:33.238 --> 05:35.085
you gotta prove to me
it's more than suicide.

05:35.205 --> 05:37.125
- Excuse me.
- All right. Thank you.

06:11.325 --> 06:13.126
Well, I, uh, take it

06:13.193 --> 06:16.396
Tia didn't know
about Victoria's depression.

06:16.463 --> 06:19.031
Just because Victoria was
depressed doesn't mean she has

06:19.098 --> 06:20.659
to tell everybody.

06:20.779 --> 06:22.289
What about you?
Did you get anything?

06:22.409 --> 06:24.803
Well, yeah. If you look
at these binders,

06:24.870 --> 06:27.806
they're all colour-coded
according to story.

06:27.873 --> 06:32.077
But there's a section missing.
That's a bit obsessive.

06:32.145 --> 06:35.112
And I found this
purple sticky note:

06:35.180 --> 06:38.182
"B.B. Guilty." Brad Barret.

06:38.250 --> 06:41.660
Purple sticky notes,
no purple section.

06:41.780 --> 06:43.754
Or maybe it was never here.

06:46.224 --> 06:48.259
Hey, Toby, check this out.

06:50.594 --> 06:52.595
There's scuff marks

06:52.663 --> 06:56.531
on the window sill here. Could be
from when she threw herself out.

06:56.651 --> 06:58.501
Could be from when she
was thrown out the window.

06:58.569 --> 07:01.037
There's no definitive proof
this was attempted homicide.

07:01.105 --> 07:03.039
There's no definitive proof
it wasn't.

07:03.107 --> 07:05.907
Yeah.

07:07.910 --> 07:10.946
Ok, we're gonna need a full
workup on Victoria's apartment.

07:11.014 --> 07:13.449
Yeah. Ok, bye.

07:13.516 --> 07:15.784
So, Dev checked
Victoria's phone records.

07:15.852 --> 07:18.153
Guess which hotelier called her
three times yesterday.

07:18.221 --> 07:21.522
- Brad Barret?
- Let's go talk to "B.B."

07:39.940 --> 07:41.375
Can I help you?

07:41.442 --> 07:43.810
IIB. We need to speak
with Mr. Barret.

07:55.655 --> 07:58.891
I've been staying
in the wrong hotels.

07:58.958 --> 08:00.359
There's Barret.

08:00.427 --> 08:02.028
Wait here.

08:04.831 --> 08:09.567
Look who he's with. All heavy hitters.
Fortune 500, all of them.

08:09.635 --> 08:11.602
That's Michael Tillman,
the developer.

08:11.670 --> 08:13.838
He's a big mover
in the port lands.

08:13.906 --> 08:17.175
And that is Jay Levinson,
the biggest

08:17.243 --> 08:19.844
- hedge fund manager in town.
- What's he doing with Barret?

08:19.912 --> 08:22.813
Barret is building a hotel empire, right?
For that he needs capital.

08:22.881 --> 08:25.149
Levinson has more money
than God.

08:25.216 --> 08:26.917
Sergeant McCluskey,

08:26.984 --> 08:29.386
IIB. This is
Special Consultant Logan.

08:29.454 --> 08:32.089
Very pleased to meet you.
I must ask you to excuse

08:32.157 --> 08:34.357
my concierge...
she's very protective of me.

08:34.426 --> 08:36.493
No problem. That's quite
the group you got there.

08:36.561 --> 08:39.328
Yes, we're just closing a deal
on a new hotel.

08:39.397 --> 08:41.664
When we're finished, the city
will have a hotel experience

08:41.731 --> 08:43.666
the likes of which has never
been seen before.

08:43.732 --> 08:45.201
That's exciting.

08:45.269 --> 08:47.870
We're here to ask you questions
about Victoria Chan.

08:47.938 --> 08:50.573
The reporter? What about her?

08:50.640 --> 08:52.341
She fell off of her balcony
last night.

08:52.409 --> 08:55.044
Oh, uh, is she all right?

08:55.112 --> 08:56.679
She's in critical condition.

08:56.746 --> 08:59.448
Well, that's, um,
that's terrible,

08:59.515 --> 09:01.416
but I'm not sure
how I can help.

09:01.484 --> 09:04.086
She wrote an article about you
that was not that flattering.

09:04.153 --> 09:06.688
I can imagine you weren't
too happy.

09:06.755 --> 09:09.291
Barret! You can't run away.

09:09.358 --> 09:12.527
I have ways of dealing
with people like you.

09:12.595 --> 09:15.762
Miss Chan had an axe to grind.
She tried

09:15.830 --> 09:18.332
to humiliate me,
made accusations...

09:18.400 --> 09:20.734
false accusations... that I mistreated
the foreign workers on my staff.

09:20.802 --> 09:25.206
Now, I'm not saying these are the
best jobs in the world, but I assure you,

09:25.273 --> 09:28.875
- our HR practices are industry standard.
- Where were you last night?

09:28.943 --> 09:31.777
I was working late
in my office. As always.

09:31.845 --> 09:35.615
And he said to me,
"you're right".

09:35.682 --> 09:39.986
I was angry with her, but if I wanted
revenge, that's what I use my lawyers for.

09:40.053 --> 09:42.054
Sorry to interrupt.
Brad, we need you

09:42.123 --> 09:44.790
back to the table. Investors are
getting a little anxious.

09:44.858 --> 09:46.891
Can't quite hold a candle
to your razzle-dazzle, brother.

09:46.959 --> 09:49.228
- We're not quite done here.
- Well, I imagine it can wait.

09:49.295 --> 09:50.829
Actually, it can't.

09:50.896 --> 09:53.132
Ok, well, I'll, uh,

09:53.199 --> 09:55.567
keep the party going.
Let me know when you're done.

09:55.635 --> 09:57.902
Look, I am sorry

09:57.970 --> 10:01.805
for Miss Chan, I really am, but I do have
some pressing business to attend to,

10:01.873 --> 10:04.875
so, please, come by sometime,

10:04.943 --> 10:06.511
have a glass of wine.

10:06.578 --> 10:10.014
Oh, there's the wine list
and the wine list.

10:10.081 --> 10:13.451
Tell the maître d' that Bradley sent you.
And you're a beer man, right?

10:13.519 --> 10:15.353
Craft beers for you.

10:15.420 --> 10:18.755
Ok, you doing good over here?
How is everyone?

10:18.822 --> 10:20.923
Unless secretaries dress

10:20.991 --> 10:23.993
like escorts, he was nowhere
near an office last night.

10:24.061 --> 10:27.096
Ok, so, the good news is he's lying.
The bad news is he has an alibi.

10:27.165 --> 10:31.468
He could have hired someone.
I saw him arguing with Victoria.

10:31.536 --> 10:35.003
I'll see if Dev can find anything
else out from her computer.

10:37.641 --> 10:40.643
Toby, I reread Victoria's story,
and something's not right.

10:40.710 --> 10:43.179
- What do you mean?
- Well,

10:43.246 --> 10:46.549
sure, it wasn't flattering, but there
was nothing of substance in it.

10:46.616 --> 10:48.950
There was nothing in it that
would have made her so upset.

10:49.018 --> 10:51.085
You think someone tampered
with it?

10:51.153 --> 10:54.522
And knowing Victoria,
that would have made her crazy.

10:54.590 --> 10:58.226
The person to ask about it would
be her editor, Patrick Donovan.

11:04.366 --> 11:07.867
Victoria's the last person I thought
would do something like this.

11:07.935 --> 11:10.704
Why is IIB investigating
an attempted suicide?

11:12.674 --> 11:14.708
Unless you suspect otherwise.

11:18.112 --> 11:20.347
It's our understanding
that Victoria was upset

11:20.415 --> 11:22.816
- with the Barret article.
- What she wrote was slanderous.

11:22.883 --> 11:26.186
Talked about Barret
sexually harassing

11:26.253 --> 11:28.588
his employees,
misappropriating funds.

11:28.655 --> 11:32.158
That sounds like a powerful story,
like you would sell a lot of papers.

11:32.226 --> 11:35.195
Yes, but she drew some of her facts
from off-the-record conversations.

11:35.262 --> 11:38.964
It opened us to litigation,
so I had to rewrite it.

11:39.032 --> 11:40.933
How'd she feel
about your changes?

11:41.000 --> 11:42.467
Wasn't happy

11:42.535 --> 11:46.504
but conflict between writer
and editor is nothing new.

11:46.572 --> 11:48.673
Happens 10 times a day
around here.

11:50.409 --> 11:53.345
You know, um, Barret wasn't
the first person

11:53.412 --> 11:55.847
to have a problem with one
of Victoria's exposés.

11:55.914 --> 11:58.449
Are you referring
to someone specific?

11:58.516 --> 12:02.019
A man named Jarod Lucic.
He owned a boutique

12:02.087 --> 12:04.789
in Yorkville. Victoria wrote

12:04.857 --> 12:07.324
a story about him selling
high-end counterfeit clothing.

12:07.392 --> 12:08.860
Did he serve time?

12:08.927 --> 12:11.928
A witness changed her
testimony... probably paid off.

12:11.996 --> 12:15.098
But the bad press drove away
his clientele and he went under.

12:15.166 --> 12:17.300
He always blamed Victoria.

12:17.368 --> 12:20.570
- Did he harass Victoria?
- I'd say so.

12:20.638 --> 12:23.039
Do you know
if she told the police?

12:23.107 --> 12:26.909
I'm hope that's something
you can ask her sometime soon.

12:26.977 --> 12:29.311
Thank you for your time.

12:29.379 --> 12:31.580
Sure.

12:50.299 --> 12:52.667
- Jarod Lucic?
- Hey.

12:52.734 --> 12:55.369
IIB. We need to ask you
a few questions.

12:55.437 --> 12:57.505
Uh, yeah, ok.

12:57.572 --> 13:00.874
Let me put some pants on.

13:00.942 --> 13:03.310
He was wearing pants.

13:03.377 --> 13:05.308
- I'll take this way.
- I got this way.

13:05.428 --> 13:06.183
Okay.

13:20.593 --> 13:22.994
Hello again.

13:28.067 --> 13:30.135
Nice pants.

13:36.980 --> 13:41.016
So, Mr. Lucic, tell us
about Victoria Chan.

13:41.084 --> 13:44.185
That bitch that ruined
my business and my marriage?

13:44.254 --> 13:46.221
She wrote about you
selling knockoff clothing.

13:46.289 --> 13:48.223
That's lies. All of it.

13:48.291 --> 13:50.058
I take it you didn't like her
very much.

13:50.126 --> 13:52.093
Yeah, she ruined my life.
I hate her.

13:52.161 --> 13:54.963
Enough to throw her
off her balcony?

13:55.030 --> 13:58.599
Whoa, whoa, where's this
coming from?

13:58.667 --> 14:01.502
She was found outside her
apartment building last night.

14:01.570 --> 14:05.005
- Where were you last night?
- I was having a drink at my local.

14:05.073 --> 14:07.107
- What time?
- Look, I don't remember.

14:07.175 --> 14:09.610
It was late.
Look, I had a few.

14:09.678 --> 14:12.846
Maybe you don't remember throwing
Miss Chan off her balcony either.

14:14.816 --> 14:17.184
Look, ask Mugsy's, all right?
They'll tell you.

14:17.252 --> 14:20.620
- Oh, we will.
- Look, I admit I wanted revenge on her.

14:20.688 --> 14:24.091
Hell, I wanted it on that whole
newspaper for what they did to me.

14:24.159 --> 14:26.493
But I did not do this.

14:26.560 --> 14:30.197
You know, most people are murdered
by someone they're close to.

14:30.265 --> 14:33.432
Yeah? So, what,
you a cop now?

14:33.500 --> 14:37.503
I'm just saying, you might want to take
a closer look at her personal life.

14:44.544 --> 14:47.013
Oh, you mean like you did?

14:47.080 --> 14:49.715
We're going to need
to see his camera.

14:55.522 --> 14:57.623
So, Victoria was having

14:57.691 --> 14:59.958
an affair with her editor?
How do you know?

15:00.026 --> 15:03.761
Well, luckily or not, Lucic was stalking them.
He was taking photos of them.

15:03.829 --> 15:06.564
Gonna want to check that out.
That puts a new angle on things.

15:06.632 --> 15:09.133
So, maybe the argument wasn't
just about the article.

15:09.201 --> 15:11.703
Maybe their romance was
in trouble.

15:11.770 --> 15:13.805
Yeah, I took a look
at Victoria's work emails

15:13.872 --> 15:15.773
with Donovan. Everything was
above board. And then

15:15.841 --> 15:18.776
I found her private email
account. Pretty spicy stuff.

15:18.844 --> 15:20.711
- Ok.
- Donovan ended the affair

15:20.778 --> 15:22.612
about a week ago and she was
not very happy about it.

15:22.680 --> 15:24.914
Then he rewrote her story
on top of it?

15:24.982 --> 15:26.950
Might be enough to send her
over the edge.

15:27.017 --> 15:29.128
So What?
You're going back to suicide?

15:29.248 --> 15:30.893
Absolutely not.
Forensics already confirmed

15:31.013 --> 15:32.756
that the laptop was wiped clean
of fingerprints.

15:32.824 --> 15:35.124
So someone wrote
the suicide note as a cover.

15:35.192 --> 15:37.326
Well, we definitely have
a case here.

15:37.394 --> 15:40.363
Who had motive? Barret lied about
what he was doing that night.

15:40.430 --> 15:43.131
Maybe Victoria threatened
to tell Donovan's wife

15:43.199 --> 15:45.634
about the affair and he decided
to get rid of her.

15:45.702 --> 15:48.337
Check out Lucic's alibi.
Find out where Donovan is.

15:48.405 --> 15:51.740
Have a little man-to-man with him. There
might be more skeletons in his closet.

15:59.915 --> 16:04.151
Mr. Donovan. Your assistant
said I'd find you here.

16:04.219 --> 16:07.188
It's nice of you
to visit Victoria.

16:07.256 --> 16:09.556
I understand
how you'd be concerned.

16:09.624 --> 16:11.558
She's more than an associate.

16:11.626 --> 16:13.260
- She's a friend.
- Yeah, well,

16:13.327 --> 16:16.797
even friends can have problems
with each other, can't they?

16:16.865 --> 16:20.834
- How could you do this to me?
- This is just business!

16:20.902 --> 16:23.036
This isn't about business;
This is about you and me!

16:23.104 --> 16:24.970
It's about us!

16:25.038 --> 16:26.706
I don't understand.

16:26.774 --> 16:28.674
Well, I should let you know
that this is now

16:28.742 --> 16:31.110
an investigation
into an attempted homicide.

16:31.177 --> 16:33.913
You think someone tried to kill her?
What does that have to do with me?

16:33.980 --> 16:36.682
Your affair with the victim is
quite relevant.

16:36.750 --> 16:38.818
What are you saying?

16:38.886 --> 16:42.487
We know you and Victoria were
seeing each other.

16:42.555 --> 16:44.923
Look, a high-pressure job,
a married man, a young woman,

16:44.990 --> 16:47.492
working closely together.
Things happen.

16:47.560 --> 16:51.229
How'd she act
when you broke it off with her?

16:51.297 --> 16:53.899
She was upset.
Look, if I thought

16:53.966 --> 16:56.700
our relationship was relevant,
I would have told you.

16:56.768 --> 16:59.703
- Were you at her apartment last night?
- I resent that line of quest...

16:59.771 --> 17:02.673
- Just answer it.
- I was at home with my wife.

17:09.881 --> 17:12.949
Do you know anything
about a purple notebook?

17:14.919 --> 17:16.886
- You seem a little upset.
- Look, I came here

17:16.954 --> 17:19.923
to see a woman I care about, and
you accuse me of trying to...

17:22.593 --> 17:24.594
I have to get back to work.

17:31.067 --> 17:32.501
Donovan may have been at home

17:32.569 --> 17:34.736
with his wife last night,
but at some point

17:34.804 --> 17:37.439
he was in Victoria's apartment
and took her binder and files.

17:37.507 --> 17:39.808
But why? Was there something
in them about the affair?

17:39.876 --> 17:41.646
Or did it have something
to do with the Barret article?

17:41.766 --> 17:42.692
He's hiding something.

17:42.812 --> 17:44.712
All right, well, see if
you can place them at the scene.

17:44.780 --> 17:46.914
- All right.
- I'll check out surveillance

17:46.982 --> 17:49.049
- and traffic cams.
- And I'll work

17:49.117 --> 17:53.754
on a warrant for his home and office.
Let's see if anything purple shows up.

17:57.893 --> 17:59.826
Ok, so, paper
from the editor's office

17:59.894 --> 18:02.829
all comes through here?
Everything?

18:02.897 --> 18:05.164
Guys, we're looking
for Victoria's notes.

18:05.232 --> 18:07.166
Keep an eye out for anything
in purple.

18:09.236 --> 18:12.005
You know what, this is
the binding. I need all these.

18:12.072 --> 18:14.941
I need all these.
You know what,

18:15.009 --> 18:17.042
just bring everything.
Everything in these bins.

18:20.279 --> 18:22.381
Why is it always
the cross-cut shredder?

18:22.448 --> 18:25.350
All right, kids, call home,
call your folks,

18:25.418 --> 18:26.852
see if you can sleep over.

18:26.920 --> 18:29.154
It's looking
like an all-nighter.

18:38.330 --> 18:39.831
Hey.

18:39.899 --> 18:43.300
- Hey.
- How are ya?

18:43.368 --> 18:45.003
So, is this our new hangout?

18:45.070 --> 18:47.638
Well, I thought if Barret's
involved, I'd immerse myself

18:47.705 --> 18:49.773
- in his world.
- But where's the TV?

18:49.841 --> 18:52.643
- Ok, I think I might have something.
- What?

18:52.710 --> 18:55.478
I had a look at Victoria's
desk at the office.

18:55.547 --> 18:57.881
How'd you get to sneak
around her office?

18:57.949 --> 19:00.407
I'm her emergency contact,
so they gave me access.

19:00.527 --> 19:01.263
No kidding.

19:01.383 --> 19:02.986
I found this
under her keyboard.

19:03.054 --> 19:07.289
"TG2BT?" What is that?
Is that a password?

19:07.357 --> 19:10.359
- You're not a prince fan? It's an acronym.
- Ok.

19:10.427 --> 19:12.494
Too good to be true.

19:12.563 --> 19:14.697
On purple. That's interesting.

19:14.765 --> 19:17.600
Compliments of Mr. Barret.

19:20.135 --> 19:22.336
Ah, it's nice to see you here
for pleasure

19:22.404 --> 19:24.839
rather than business, Mr. Logan.

19:24.907 --> 19:26.775
Uh, it is for pleasure,
I take it?

19:26.842 --> 19:28.743
Actually, I'm here on business.

19:28.811 --> 19:30.879
I'm Tia Tremblay.
I'm a reporter.

19:30.947 --> 19:32.614
Victoria Chan is my friend.

19:32.682 --> 19:36.216
Ah, I see. And, um,
how is Victoria?

19:36.284 --> 19:38.719
As good as one can be
in a coma.

19:38.787 --> 19:41.221
I'd love to ask you
a few questions.

19:41.289 --> 19:44.123
- Well, of course.
- Great! How about now?

19:44.191 --> 19:47.259
Well, I'd love to, but right now
I have some investors waiting.

19:47.327 --> 19:49.662
But please promise me you'll
schedule an appointment

19:49.730 --> 19:51.664
with my personal assistant, hmm?

19:51.732 --> 19:53.532
It's good to see you again.

19:53.601 --> 19:55.935
- Enjoy the drinks.
- Cheers.

19:59.105 --> 20:01.707
I guess he's not in
the mood to talk.

20:01.774 --> 20:04.375
He sure lays on the charm,
doesn't he?

20:04.443 --> 20:07.178
The decor, the atmosphere...

20:07.246 --> 20:09.547
it's too good to be true.

20:09.616 --> 20:11.216
Thank you for that.

20:11.283 --> 20:14.719
Now you can leave
the investigating up to IIB.

20:14.786 --> 20:17.554
This is my job.

20:17.623 --> 20:21.092
Victoria knew something,
and now she's in a coma.

20:21.159 --> 20:23.127
I'm not buying
Prince Charming's act one bit.

20:23.194 --> 20:25.630
He's not the only one
with a motive, Tia.

20:25.697 --> 20:27.464
What are you talking about?

20:27.532 --> 20:30.300
Why didn't you tell me
that Victoria and Donovan were

20:30.368 --> 20:32.301
- having an affair?
- Donovan, her editor?

20:32.369 --> 20:34.904
- Yeah.
- 'Cause I had no idea.

20:34.972 --> 20:37.340
I thought you knew.

20:39.644 --> 20:42.012
I guess I didn't know her
as well as I thought.

20:45.683 --> 20:48.684
There ya go. Come on, will!
There ya go! There ya go!

21:02.298 --> 21:03.898
What are you doing here?

21:37.816 --> 21:39.417
Ok. Thank you.

21:39.485 --> 21:43.121
So, a jogger found the body
this morning.

21:43.189 --> 21:46.723
Donovan's wallet was found in the ravine...
cash and credit cards were missing.

21:46.791 --> 21:49.260
He lives like two blocks
from here, so Metro figures

21:49.327 --> 21:51.561
he was out walking his dog
and then got mugged.

21:51.629 --> 21:54.731
Or somebody wanted it to look that way.
There's no sign of a struggle.

21:54.799 --> 21:57.334
And if he gave up
his valuables, why shoot him?

21:57.402 --> 22:00.271
He was killed for more than
his wallet. Something's up here.

22:00.338 --> 22:02.805
Two lovers,
one thrown off her balcony,

22:02.873 --> 22:05.108
the other one shot
in the chest.

22:05.175 --> 22:08.077
- Let's talk to his wife.
- Yeah.

22:09.814 --> 22:14.751
I woke up this morning, and
there was this scratching sound.

22:14.819 --> 22:17.820
It was our dog. He wanted in.

22:17.887 --> 22:21.056
And you didn't notice that your
husband was gone all night?

22:21.124 --> 22:24.026
Patrick often worked all night
in his study,

22:24.094 --> 22:28.831
or he... he stayed at...
at the office.

22:28.898 --> 22:31.900
He didn't come home often?

22:31.968 --> 22:34.703
Not as often as I would
have liked.

22:34.770 --> 22:38.039
You know your husband was having
an affair with Victoria Chan?

22:38.107 --> 22:40.041
Yeah, I, um...

22:40.109 --> 22:43.345
I found out recently.

22:43.412 --> 22:45.714
This man came to our door.

22:51.919 --> 22:53.554
Jarod Lucic.

22:53.622 --> 22:56.223
He didn't tell me his name;
He just gave me

22:56.291 --> 22:58.459
some photographs.

22:58.526 --> 23:01.495
I confronted Patrick
when he came home.

23:01.563 --> 23:06.366
It was... it was horrible.

23:06.433 --> 23:09.969
Ok, you know how...
how this looks to us, right?

23:10.036 --> 23:14.206
Your husband shot, Victoria
falling off of her balcony...

23:14.275 --> 23:16.242
Patrick told me everything.

23:16.310 --> 23:18.878
I mean, he begged
my forgiveness.

23:22.615 --> 23:25.950
That's a really beautiful ring.

23:26.018 --> 23:28.453
Looks new.
How many carats is that?

23:28.521 --> 23:31.690
Three carats.

23:31.758 --> 23:33.825
Patrick went overboard.

23:35.695 --> 23:37.662
It was an apology

23:37.729 --> 23:39.764
and a promise.

23:42.567 --> 23:44.602
What the hell?

23:49.308 --> 23:51.810
How's your arts-and-crafts
project coming?

23:51.877 --> 23:54.912
Well, we've got most
of the notebook isolated.

23:54.979 --> 23:57.848
Now we're just working on putting
together sentence fragments,

23:57.916 --> 23:59.817
and once that's finished,
the real fun starts.

23:59.884 --> 24:02.452
My cursive construction
software...

24:02.520 --> 24:06.023
Will tell us exactly what was
in Victoria's notes.

24:06.090 --> 24:08.692
Guys, come on, pick up the pace.
Let's get it together.

24:08.759 --> 24:11.027
So, is our grieving widow
a suspect?

24:11.094 --> 24:13.062
Well, I think
her grief is genuine.

24:13.130 --> 24:15.698
- She wanted to work it out.
- So did he.

24:15.765 --> 24:17.800
He got her a three-carat
apology ring.

24:17.868 --> 24:20.169
I spoke to the woman
at the jewellery store.

24:20.237 --> 24:22.205
It set him back $40,000.

24:22.272 --> 24:24.340
- Forty grand?
- Yeah.

24:24.407 --> 24:27.275
Editors don't make that kind of money.
Did we check his financials?

24:27.343 --> 24:31.146
Yeah. Nothing was taken from his bank accounts.
It was paid for in cold, hard cash.

24:31.214 --> 24:32.848
Forty K in cash?

24:32.915 --> 24:35.083
Ok, so, look, Barret knows
that this negative article is

24:35.151 --> 24:37.685
gonna be published, right?
What can he do to stop it?

24:37.753 --> 24:39.888
You're suggesting
that he paid Donovan 40k

24:39.956 --> 24:41.956
- to rewrite it.
- But for that kind of money,

24:42.023 --> 24:44.458
you'd think the article would be
a little bit more flattering.

24:44.525 --> 24:47.494
Maybe Victoria had something even
more incriminating on Barret.

24:47.562 --> 24:49.964
- Why, do you have something?
- Tia found a note

24:50.031 --> 24:53.167
in Victoria's office that said
Barret was too good to be true.

24:53.235 --> 24:56.636
Which is maybe why Donovan
took Victoria's research.

24:56.704 --> 24:59.005
What about our friend
Mr. Lucic?

24:59.073 --> 25:01.574
Well, we know that
he showed up at Donovan's house

25:01.641 --> 25:03.676
and showed his wife
those photos.

25:03.744 --> 25:06.179
What about his alibi for the
night that Victoria was pushed?

25:06.247 --> 25:08.381
He arrived at the pub
a little after 11.

25:08.448 --> 25:11.217
Well, that would give him plenty of
time to show up at her apartment.

25:11.285 --> 25:13.218
Bartender said he came in
ranting all the time

25:13.286 --> 25:15.720
about how Victoria
and her editor ruined his life.

25:15.788 --> 25:18.357
Maybe he tried to ruin theirs.

25:18.424 --> 25:20.692
I'll have Metro
pick him up again.

25:22.862 --> 25:27.032
<i>So I showed the wife a
couple of pictures. Is that a crime?</i>

25:27.100 --> 25:29.666
- No, but stalking is.
- You hated Patrick, didn't you?

25:29.734 --> 25:32.636
Yeah, I hated him.
That bastard printed slander,

25:32.704 --> 25:36.240
which I beat in court. The way we
hear it, the victims were paid off.

25:36.308 --> 25:38.876
You wanted to hurt Donovan
and Victoria.

25:38.944 --> 25:42.746
Yeah, I did. And the beauty of them
having the bed sweats for each other

25:42.814 --> 25:44.848
meant I could hurt them both
at the same time.

25:44.916 --> 25:49.085
You see, the thing about revenge,
Jarod, is it's never enough.

25:49.153 --> 25:51.087
But ruining his marriage
and making him break it off

25:51.155 --> 25:53.290
with Victoria, that wasn't
enough for you, was it?

25:53.357 --> 25:55.458
So you pushed Victoria
off her balcony.

25:55.526 --> 25:58.428
<i>That's crazy,</i>
<i>I didn't murder anyone.</i>

25:58.495 --> 26:00.996
And then you shot Donovan
in the chest to finish it off.

26:01.064 --> 26:03.665
Ok, whoa.
Yeah, I wanted to hurt them,

26:03.733 --> 26:06.168
but I didn't want to go to jail.
All right, they ruined my life

26:06.236 --> 26:09.038
once already; I wasn't gonna
let them do it again.

26:20.682 --> 26:22.616
He's twisted,
but he's not a murderer.

26:22.684 --> 26:24.919
All right, something else
came up. Forensics called.

26:24.986 --> 26:27.555
Patrick Donovan was killed
with a .22-caliber bullet.

26:27.622 --> 26:30.591
Now, according to the gun
registry, Barret owns a .22.

26:30.659 --> 26:34.328
- Ok, do we have a warrant?
- Ask and you shall receive.

26:34.395 --> 26:35.830
Get me something I can use.

26:37.899 --> 26:39.433
Hey.

26:39.501 --> 26:41.768
Toby, it's me.
I'm at the hotel. Listen,

26:41.836 --> 26:44.671
I've been talking to Barret's employees.
They're all shutting me down.

26:44.738 --> 26:46.205
Well, that's not surprising.

26:46.273 --> 26:49.308
Their boss is a suspect
in Victoria's fall.

26:49.376 --> 26:52.612
Look, Tia, you gotta stay away
from Barret.

26:52.680 --> 26:54.313
Stay away? Are you kidding me?

26:54.381 --> 26:56.549
<i>We're handling
the investigation.</i>

26:56.617 --> 26:58.517
It would be a lot safer
if you leave it to us.

26:58.585 --> 27:00.519
<i>Toby, I'm a reporter.
This is what I do.</i>

27:00.587 --> 27:02.488
Yeah, you're also
too personally involved.

27:02.555 --> 27:05.724
I'm getting answers.

27:05.792 --> 27:08.660
Apparently something's wrong
with Barret's finances.

27:08.728 --> 27:10.629
Investors are starting to walk
away. I think that might be

27:10.697 --> 27:12.731
what Victoria's story was
really about.

27:12.799 --> 27:15.600
Now, listen, you don't want to
share information about the case,

27:15.667 --> 27:18.136
I respect that, but I won't stop
chasing this story.

27:22.074 --> 27:23.708
Tia's all over Barret.

27:23.775 --> 27:25.676
There's something wrong
with his finances.

27:25.744 --> 27:27.778
Well, let's find out
for ourselves.

27:42.060 --> 27:44.194
That doesn't sound
like a business meeting.

27:46.596 --> 27:49.298
- You got the password?
- Warrant.

27:49.366 --> 27:51.300
Right here.

27:51.368 --> 27:53.136
Thank you.

27:57.041 --> 28:00.143
- Ok.
- Shareholder's meeting?

28:02.111 --> 28:04.079
Oh... oh!

28:04.147 --> 28:07.482
♪ Ah yeah ♪

28:07.550 --> 28:09.651
I want to speak with
my lawyer.

28:12.321 --> 28:15.723
- That's probably a good idea.
- ♪ ah yeah ♪

28:26.620 --> 28:28.720
How's she doing?

28:28.787 --> 28:31.856
The doctors seem hopeful.

28:31.924 --> 28:33.458
How are you?

28:33.526 --> 28:36.695
I just wish there was more
I could do.

28:36.762 --> 28:39.964
I wish I could help take down
whoever did this to her.

28:40.032 --> 28:42.601
We arrested Brad Barret
last night.

28:42.668 --> 28:45.102
- You did?
- There's some evidence

28:45.169 --> 28:47.204
that makes it look
like he might be involved.

28:47.272 --> 28:49.340
We haven't interrogated him yet,
but he might be the kind of guy

28:49.407 --> 28:51.408
we can't keep our hands on
for too long.

28:51.476 --> 28:54.411
Listen, anything you need, let
me know, I'll be happy to help.

28:54.479 --> 28:58.582
Tia, you're doing too much
already.

28:58.650 --> 29:03.286
- What's that supposed to mean?
- You should back off.

29:03.354 --> 29:06.556
I can't believe
I'm hearing this.

29:06.624 --> 29:08.991
This guy might be responsible
for what happened

29:09.059 --> 29:11.660
to Victoria and Patrick.
This is very dangerous.

29:11.780 --> 29:12.685
This is my job,

29:12.805 --> 29:14.930
Ok? I've done it for 10 years.
I can look after myself.

29:14.998 --> 29:17.098
I don't want you getting hurt
for some good scoop.

29:17.166 --> 29:18.634
This isn't about a scoop!

29:18.701 --> 29:22.504
This is about a friend that
I respect and that I care about

29:22.572 --> 29:24.506
who nearly died for this story.

29:24.574 --> 29:26.675
So I owe it to her
to look into this.

29:26.743 --> 29:28.677
Not if you get killed.

29:28.745 --> 29:30.545
Please. Tia, back off. Tia...

29:30.613 --> 29:32.946
I... I know what I'm doing.

29:50.097 --> 29:52.031
That's a very interesting

29:52.099 --> 29:54.233
business meeting that you were
having, Mr. Barret.

29:54.302 --> 29:56.770
You had no legal right to come
into that room,

29:56.837 --> 30:00.072
so without a warrant...
you have nothing.

30:04.877 --> 30:06.378
Ah.

30:06.446 --> 30:09.782
Well, actually,
we did have a warrant.

30:09.849 --> 30:13.385
And as we speak, forensics is
going over a .22-caliber handgun

30:13.453 --> 30:16.622
that we found in your room.
Now, that was the same caliber

30:16.690 --> 30:19.891
- that was used to kill Donovan.
- Patrick Donovan?

30:19.959 --> 30:23.060
Do you think I'd be so stupid as
to keep a murder weapon with me?

30:23.128 --> 30:25.730
Look, I keep telling you,
I had nothing to do

30:25.798 --> 30:28.800
with what happened
to him or that reporter.

30:28.867 --> 30:31.569
You paid Donovan
to rewrite Victoria's article.

30:31.637 --> 30:33.705
- I did no such thing.
- It had to be published;

30:33.772 --> 30:35.807
otherwise Victoria would have
made a stink.

30:35.874 --> 30:38.809
You just made sure that it made
as little damage as possible.

30:38.876 --> 30:41.277
That is crazy.
I have nothing to hide.

30:49.253 --> 30:51.221
Ah.

30:51.288 --> 30:54.857
So, Victoria wasn't gonna write about
your cocaine and hooker parties?

30:54.924 --> 30:57.693
Are these parties the reason
you're beginning

30:57.761 --> 31:00.663
- to lose investors?
<i>- Damn it, Martin!</i>

31:00.731 --> 31:03.766
Some investors have unreasonable
expectations.

31:03.834 --> 31:06.268
They expect double digits
or they move on.

31:06.336 --> 31:09.604
You can't please everyone.
It's all part of the business.

31:09.672 --> 31:11.706
I need a word.

31:23.853 --> 31:27.488
Forensics came back. Barret's
gun is not the murder weapon.

31:27.555 --> 31:31.425
Ok. I can see why Victoria
called him "Too good to be true".

31:31.493 --> 31:34.262
So, what, you think she was gonna write
about the drugs and prostitutes?

31:34.329 --> 31:36.764
- I do.
- Well, with or without the gun,

31:36.831 --> 31:39.066
we still have enough to hold him
until we find out more.

31:39.134 --> 31:41.167
And I got a little read.

31:41.235 --> 31:43.937
I think I got the first name
of an investor. Martin.

31:44.005 --> 31:47.640
Last name Reynolds. Self-made
millionaire who made his fortune

31:47.708 --> 31:50.643
- in the '90s real estate boom.
- Must have a nose for investment.

31:50.711 --> 31:53.413
You think he smelt something bad and
pulled out of Barret's operation?

31:53.480 --> 31:55.423
Maybe he's the missing
piece of the puzzle.

31:55.543 --> 31:56.784
Do you think he's a suspect?

31:56.904 --> 31:59.118
He's definitely
a person of interest.

31:59.185 --> 32:02.254
- I'd say a little more than that.
- Ah.

32:02.322 --> 32:05.690
The arts-and-crafts project. Now, from
what I've gathered from Victoria's

32:05.758 --> 32:08.093
research, Reynolds was
a major investor

32:08.161 --> 32:10.529
in Barret's empire.
It must have really hurt

32:10.596 --> 32:13.631
- when he pulled out his capital.
- Let's track him down.

32:27.646 --> 32:29.646
Mr. Reynolds. IIB.

32:29.713 --> 32:32.149
We'd like to speak with you
about Brad Barret.

32:32.216 --> 32:34.918
I really don't have time for this.
I have a meeting in a few minutes.

32:34.986 --> 32:36.853
We'll keep it brief.

32:38.823 --> 32:40.824
Please, let's stay warm.

32:45.129 --> 32:48.364
Why did you leave
Barret properties?

32:48.432 --> 32:52.101
I had some... difference
with one of the principals.

32:52.169 --> 32:54.470
- Barret?
- I can't say.

32:54.537 --> 32:56.905
This is a house of cards,
Levinson!

32:56.974 --> 32:59.408
You said your piece.
Now go.

32:59.476 --> 33:01.610
Levinson.

33:01.678 --> 33:03.612
I won't confirm
that it was Levinson,

33:03.680 --> 33:05.381
but I won't deny it either.

33:05.449 --> 33:07.748
What was the issue between you
and Jay Levinson?

33:07.816 --> 33:10.585
I'm sorry. I've already said
too much.

33:10.652 --> 33:12.687
If you're withholding
information relevant

33:12.754 --> 33:15.890
to this investigation, we can
charge you with obstruction.

33:18.394 --> 33:22.497
Levinson manages a hedge fund
holding over $500 million.

33:22.564 --> 33:24.931
He bought a big stake
in Barret properties

33:25.000 --> 33:28.835
and paid for it in units
of his fund. If his fund tanks,

33:28.903 --> 33:31.872
then Barret properties tumbles
like a house of cards.

33:31.939 --> 33:35.876
- But his fund didn't tank.
- No, quite the opposite.

33:35.943 --> 33:39.612
These figures just don't add up.
No fund can perform that well.

33:39.679 --> 33:43.849
In my experience, if something is too
good to be true, it probably is.

33:43.917 --> 33:47.686
What was in Barret who was too
good to be true was Levinson.

33:47.754 --> 33:50.890
Did you tell Victoria Chan about
Levinson's investment scheme?

33:50.957 --> 33:55.327
I may have leaked a file
or two before I signed my NDA.

33:55.395 --> 33:57.795
She was convinced
that Barret was guilty

33:57.863 --> 33:59.998
of some financial impropriety,

34:00.066 --> 34:02.267
but he was simply oblivious.

34:02.335 --> 34:04.769
I said just as much
to another journalist

34:04.837 --> 34:07.472
- just this morning.
- Who's the other journalist?

34:07.540 --> 34:09.706
Tia... something.

34:09.775 --> 34:11.742
Tia Tremblay.
What did you tell her, exactly?

34:11.809 --> 34:13.777
She said she was
working her way down

34:13.844 --> 34:16.947
a list of investors,
looking for dirt on Barret.

34:17.014 --> 34:18.982
She asked me about Levinson,

34:19.051 --> 34:21.217
and I said he was worth
talking to.

34:21.286 --> 34:23.286
I think he was next
on her list.

34:27.257 --> 34:29.492
<i>Dev, we need
a location for Tia.</i>

34:29.560 --> 34:32.628
Her cell's off, or maybe she's just
not taking my phone calls right now.

34:32.696 --> 34:35.331
Ok. I'll triangulate her phone
and get her 20 to you.

34:35.399 --> 34:39.135
- As quick as you can, Dev.
- Hey, guys, I finished my little project,

34:39.203 --> 34:42.004
<i>and you're never gonna guess who
Victoria's expose was about.</i>

34:42.072 --> 34:44.339
- We know. Jay Levinson.
- Way to steal my thunder,

34:44.407 --> 34:46.875
Michelle. Thank you. But here's
something you may not know.

34:46.943 --> 34:49.610
<i>Victoria drilled down deeper
under Reynolds' suspicions</i>

34:52.748 --> 34:55.917
Now, some of the companies that are
investments aren't even real companies.

34:55.985 --> 34:59.388
<i>And a high-visibility investor like Barret's,
it makes the whole thing look real.</i>

34:59.456 --> 35:01.422
Ok, so Levinson would have
been ruined.

35:01.490 --> 35:04.125
He was the one who bribed
Donovan to change the story.

35:04.193 --> 35:07.095
Yeah, but that wasn't enough,
so he had to tie up loose ends,

35:07.162 --> 35:09.263
so first goes Victoria,
and then Donovan.

35:09.331 --> 35:12.000
Which explains why I didn't read
guilt off Barret... he didn't do it.

35:12.068 --> 35:14.669
We're gonna need
Levinson's address.

35:14.737 --> 35:17.071
He's staying at a suite
at Barret's hotel.

35:17.138 --> 35:19.106
She could be with Levinson
right now.

35:19.173 --> 35:22.610
- We don't know that, Toby.
- She has no idea he's the killer.

35:27.782 --> 35:29.850
Hi, I'm Tia Tremblay.

35:29.918 --> 35:32.219
I'm a friend and colleague of
Victoria Chan. I'm following up

35:32.286 --> 35:34.221
on some research she did
for a recent article

35:34.288 --> 35:36.523
about Brad Barret.
May I come in?

35:36.591 --> 35:40.059
Of course. Always eager
to meet with the press.

35:40.128 --> 35:41.628
All right.

35:51.484 --> 35:54.152
Come on, Tia, pick up.

35:56.256 --> 35:58.523
Guys, I triangulated
Tia's phone.

35:58.591 --> 36:01.126
<i>Bad news.
She's inside the hotel.</i>

36:04.096 --> 36:06.865
Get me hotel security, please.

36:06.932 --> 36:09.833
I'm going to get them to search the
hotel, see if they can find her.

36:09.901 --> 36:11.835
Ok.

36:11.903 --> 36:14.972
Come on. Come on.

36:15.039 --> 36:17.375
You caught me in the middle
of a late lunch.

36:17.442 --> 36:20.411
- Some wine?
- No, thank you.

36:20.479 --> 36:24.247
Ok, now, I haven't had the pleasure of
meeting Miss Chan, but I understand

36:24.315 --> 36:26.983
- she was quite the journalist.
- Is. She's

36:27.050 --> 36:28.985
- still alive.
- Forgive me.

36:29.052 --> 36:30.720
Poor choice of words.

36:30.788 --> 36:32.855
I did read her piece
on Barret, though.

36:32.923 --> 36:35.191
more bark than bite.

36:35.259 --> 36:39.663
You know, I agree. I think
there was more to that story.

36:39.730 --> 36:42.564
I think that Victoria was
on to something much bigger.

36:42.632 --> 36:48.437
Really? I'd be fascinated to hear what
grand mystery Victoria was on to.

36:48.505 --> 36:50.472
There are some rumors

36:50.540 --> 36:54.310
that some of the investors are
dissatisfied.

36:54.377 --> 36:56.678
Dissatisfied with what,
exactly?

36:56.745 --> 36:59.948
Well, I'm supposed to be asking
the questions, Mr. Levinson.

37:00.016 --> 37:01.983
Is it true that there's been

37:02.051 --> 37:04.319
some dissension among
Barret's investors?

37:04.386 --> 37:06.487
You've been talking
to Reynolds.

37:06.555 --> 37:08.890
I can't divulge my sources.

37:08.958 --> 37:10.826
Of course not.

37:10.893 --> 37:12.759
But I interrupted you.

37:12.828 --> 37:15.662
You were about to share with me
what Victoria had uncovered.

37:15.730 --> 37:18.833
You need to come with us.

37:18.900 --> 37:20.835
Take us to Levinson.

37:20.902 --> 37:23.570
Still nothing from Tia.

37:32.146 --> 37:34.214
You seem reluctant
to share with me.

37:34.281 --> 37:37.183
- You seem anxious to know.
- Anxious? Not anxious.

37:37.251 --> 37:39.752
Just curious.

37:49.729 --> 37:52.030
I have an emergency.

37:52.098 --> 37:54.096
Really? I haven't
answered your questions.

37:54.216 --> 37:54.881
You did.

37:55.001 --> 37:57.635
And I have to go.
I need to go.

37:57.703 --> 37:59.971
- Now.
- I'm still curious, though.

38:00.038 --> 38:03.040
I'd really love to know what was
so terribly important to Victoria

38:03.108 --> 38:07.111
that she'd throw herself
from a fourth-floor window.

38:07.179 --> 38:09.113
How did you know
it was the fourth floor?

38:09.181 --> 38:11.315
I don't remember that
being reported anywhere.

38:11.383 --> 38:14.752
I suppose I found out
some other way.

38:17.522 --> 38:20.791
Thank you for speaking to me,
Mr. Levinson. I have to go now.

38:20.859 --> 38:23.159
So soon? I think that

38:23.227 --> 38:26.096
you and I should just talk
a little more.

38:30.468 --> 38:32.635
Ah! No.

38:32.703 --> 38:34.203
Thank you.

38:34.271 --> 38:37.306
It's Tia.

38:40.243 --> 38:44.447
- Drop the knife!
- Can't do that.

38:44.515 --> 38:48.417
Put down the knife down
or I put you down.

38:48.484 --> 38:51.319
I've seen my partner drop
people from twice as far away.

38:51.387 --> 38:53.522
Yeah, well, I'm calling
her bluff.

38:53.589 --> 38:55.724
You don't want more blood
on your hands, Levinson.

38:55.792 --> 38:58.727
What is this? The part where
you talk me off the ledge?

38:58.795 --> 39:02.030
We know about Victoria.

39:02.097 --> 39:04.899
- You can't buy me off like Patrick.
- Oh, yeah?

39:12.874 --> 39:14.575
You don't know anything.

39:14.643 --> 39:16.877
We know about Patrick Donovan
too.

39:23.884 --> 39:26.018
You were waiting for him
in High Park. You shot him.

39:26.086 --> 39:27.720
And the gun...

39:30.157 --> 39:33.927
We found the gun in a garbage at the
entrance to the park. It's over.

39:33.994 --> 39:36.062
Let her go
at the count of three

39:36.129 --> 39:38.163
or my partner is gonna
drop you. One...

39:38.230 --> 39:41.232
Two...
Ugh!

39:41.300 --> 39:43.802
Oof!

39:46.773 --> 39:49.074
Turn around.
On your stomach. Now.

39:51.043 --> 39:53.077
You all right?

40:06.057 --> 40:07.891
He fully tackled
the guy.

40:07.959 --> 40:10.861
Ok, so what you're saying is you
brought a him to a knife fight?

40:10.928 --> 40:12.929
No, no, no, Tia was the star
of the show. Really, she...

40:12.998 --> 40:15.965
So, you brought a Tia to a knife fight?

40:16.033 --> 40:19.035
The gun was recovered from the garbage can.
Thank you, Toby, as you predicted.

40:19.103 --> 40:20.669
It was a black-market piece;

40:20.737 --> 40:23.172
the serial numbers were
ground off, but a partial print

40:23.240 --> 40:25.274
on a chambered bullet matches
Levinson's.

40:25.342 --> 40:26.809
What's going on with Barret?

40:26.877 --> 40:28.844
Well, Levinson's accounts have
been frozen,

40:28.912 --> 40:31.279
his assets have been seized.
As he falls, so goes

40:31.347 --> 40:34.316
the whole house of cards.
Barret's empire will tumble.

40:34.384 --> 40:38.120
- Couldn't happen to a nicer fellow.
- A shame.

40:38.187 --> 40:40.622
And, uh, guys. Good job.

40:58.273 --> 41:01.442
You keeping vigil?

41:01.510 --> 41:04.710
Relief is on the way. Her parents
have just landed from Shanghai.

41:04.778 --> 41:07.947
- How is she?
- Well, the surgeon says,

41:08.015 --> 41:10.816
with intensive therapy,
she should recover.

41:10.884 --> 41:12.885
- That's great.
- Yeah.

41:12.953 --> 41:15.821
It'll be a long road, but
if anyone can do it, she can.

41:15.889 --> 41:19.425
She's a fighter.

41:19.492 --> 41:22.227
She heard me.

41:26.766 --> 41:29.000
- You feel better?
- Yeah. Much better, thank you.

41:29.069 --> 41:30.502
Good.

41:30.570 --> 41:32.871
Um, so, Toby,
this is kinda weird,

41:32.939 --> 41:37.041
but, um, you said, when you were
talking Levinson down,

41:37.109 --> 41:39.043
you said something
about the gun.

41:39.111 --> 41:41.679
Yeah. What's weird
about that?

41:41.746 --> 41:44.014
You knew it was in the garbage.

41:44.083 --> 41:46.016
Yeah, I know the area.
It just seemed

41:46.085 --> 41:48.619
like the most logical place
he'd have dumped the gun.

41:48.687 --> 41:51.854
- So you're saying you bluffed?
- I bluffed.

41:51.922 --> 41:54.791
- That accurately?
- I'm that good.

41:57.095 --> 42:00.530
So, what do you really do
for the IIB? Just bluff?

42:00.598 --> 42:02.499
Or do you really read faces?

42:02.567 --> 42:04.568
Can you tell me
what I'm thinking right now?

42:04.635 --> 42:06.835
You want a coffee...
Black, two sugars.

42:06.903 --> 42:10.206
Not even close. I was thinking
that my boyfriend is gonna

42:10.273 --> 42:12.541
take me out for a really nice
dinner tonight.

42:12.609 --> 42:14.543
- See? I'm not that talented.
- Oh, no.

42:14.611 --> 42:16.178
Oh. Ok.

42:22.851 --> 42:24.385
Hey.
