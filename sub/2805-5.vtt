00:03.170 --> 00:05.631
PETER: If Mickey Mantle
had this much water pressure,

00:05.714 --> 00:07.341
he'd have hit 60 before Maris.

00:07.424 --> 00:11.470
ELIZABETH: After that, all you can talk
about is baseball and plumbing?

00:11.637 --> 00:13.680
Mmm. Oh. Oh.

00:13.764 --> 00:14.973
This game's going extra innings.

00:15.265 --> 00:16.767
You think you can
knock it out of the park?

00:16.850 --> 00:18.352
-Oh, I know I can.
-Oh, yeah?

00:18.435 --> 00:19.645
Oh, yeah.

00:19.728 --> 00:20.896
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

00:22.189 --> 00:23.398
-Mmm.
-(SHUDDERS)

00:24.983 --> 00:26.318
-You okay?
-Yeah, that was weird.

00:26.401 --> 00:27.444
I just got a chill.

00:27.528 --> 00:29.446
Did you get your flu shot?
There's a bug going around.

00:29.530 --> 00:31.907
I haven't been sick since 1996.

00:31.990 --> 00:34.034
Now, come on, I'm up to bat, and you...

00:34.117 --> 00:35.118
You feel hot.

00:35.202 --> 00:36.286
You look hot.

00:36.370 --> 00:37.454
Well, this game's rained out.

00:37.579 --> 00:39.122
-I'm taking your temperature.
-Oh, honey.

00:39.248 --> 00:41.333
No, please, come on.
We can play through this.

00:41.500 --> 00:42.960
All right? Come on, batter up.

00:43.043 --> 00:44.127
Open up.

00:46.046 --> 00:47.464
Colony collapse, Neal.

00:47.548 --> 00:48.799
That's what we're dealing with here.

00:49.216 --> 00:52.761
<i>Apis mellifera</i> are dying off
in terrifying proportions.

00:52.970 --> 00:54.137
NEAL: Timmy Nolan Park.

00:54.263 --> 00:56.640
People for the Awareness
of Near-Earth Objects,

00:56.974 --> 00:59.017
and now the plight of the honeybees.

00:59.142 --> 01:02.187
Our nation's agriculture
depends on these drones.

01:02.271 --> 01:06.483
Without pollination,
there's no strawberries, no almonds...

01:06.567 --> 01:07.734
No grapes?

01:08.193 --> 01:09.403
Is this about wine?

01:10.070 --> 01:11.613
Maybe. You have room for three hives.

01:11.697 --> 01:14.032
That's three more beehives
than I want on my terrace.

01:15.200 --> 01:17.160
I mean, is beekeeping
even legal in New York?

01:17.286 --> 01:18.829
Across all five boroughs.

01:18.912 --> 01:20.539
I mean, where's the danger?

01:20.914 --> 01:22.833
Swarms spring to mind.

01:24.251 --> 01:28.255
(SIGHING) Although a hive would be
a decent hiding spot for contraband.

01:28.338 --> 01:30.507
And an excellent business opportunity.

01:30.591 --> 01:31.967
Pollen, propolis, and honey

01:32.050 --> 01:34.469
have been known for
their healing properties

01:34.553 --> 01:35.721
since Ancient Greece.

01:35.846 --> 01:39.808
And Cleopatra bathed
in milk and honey, and take it from me,

01:39.892 --> 01:41.476
what it did for my undercarriage...

01:41.560 --> 01:43.312
Okay. Start with one hive.

01:43.687 --> 01:44.938
See you later.

01:51.945 --> 01:53.363
PETER: Probably just allergies.

01:53.447 --> 01:55.699
All those trees
dropping pollen everywhere.

01:55.908 --> 01:58.118
I do love how leafy this neighborhood is.

01:58.327 --> 01:59.661
What is Neal doing here?

01:59.870 --> 02:01.413
Does he have a tracker on you?

02:01.496 --> 02:02.789
Told him I was walking you to work.

02:02.873 --> 02:03.916
-Morning, Peter.
-Morning.

02:03.999 --> 02:05.000
-Elizabeth.
-Morning.

02:05.083 --> 02:06.793
-Want me to carry that for you?
-You're casing her art.

02:06.877 --> 02:08.754
-What?
-You're casing my art?

02:08.837 --> 02:11.006
Please. You guys qualify
for the friends and family plan.

02:11.298 --> 02:12.466
I don't know what that means.

02:12.591 --> 02:13.926
Speaking of families...

02:14.176 --> 02:15.802
PETER: Oh, yeah, that's unbelievable.

02:15.886 --> 02:17.221
Figure your kid's dead...

02:17.304 --> 02:19.681
Then after 15 years,
Patrick shows up at the front door.

02:19.765 --> 02:22.267
How does a 14-year-old
evade an international manhunt?

02:22.392 --> 02:23.560
When was the last time you saw him?

02:23.685 --> 02:25.229
The summer before my junior year.

02:25.562 --> 02:28.315
I fell in love with Europe.

02:29.191 --> 02:30.859
We were going to museums in every city,

02:30.943 --> 02:33.111
and it was one of the best
tutoring jobs I ever had.

02:33.445 --> 02:35.572
But then he ran away from
boarding school in Switzerland,

02:35.656 --> 02:36.698
and I never heard from him again.

02:36.782 --> 02:39.826
Must be nice to have a father
who welcomes you home with old masters.

02:39.993 --> 02:42.162
He wanted a lot of new pieces
before the homecoming party.

02:42.871 --> 02:44.206
Well, it will be nice to see him

02:44.331 --> 02:46.792
and William, and, wow,
Bee was just a baby.

02:47.084 --> 02:49.002
-And of course Stanton.
-Who's Stanton?

02:49.127 --> 02:51.463
The butler. He was kind of the glue
that kept the family together.

02:51.547 --> 02:52.673
Just one butler?

02:52.965 --> 02:55.050
Very frugal for gazillionaires.

02:55.300 --> 02:56.385
(LAUGHS) Okay, I'm leaving.

02:56.468 --> 02:58.428
Hey, by the way, I'm gonna be
putting alarms on the art.

03:00.055 --> 03:01.223
Mmm?

03:02.891 --> 03:03.976
-Oh...
-No.

03:04.434 --> 03:06.645
-Just one.
-What's going on?

03:07.062 --> 03:08.730
-You sick?
-Come on.

03:08.856 --> 03:11.400
The Mortensen Real Estate
scandal's not gonna solve itself.

03:11.984 --> 03:13.235
I wish it would.

03:20.868 --> 03:21.994
(DOORBELL CHIMING)

03:24.913 --> 03:26.999
Mrs. Burke. Do come in.

03:27.082 --> 03:28.667
Stanton, you still can call me Elizabeth.

03:28.750 --> 03:32.045
Unfortunately, I cannot.

03:33.297 --> 03:34.506
Good day.

03:39.595 --> 03:41.430
BEE: Dad, you can't fire him.

03:41.638 --> 03:43.891
I'm telling you it's a violation
of labor rights.

03:43.974 --> 03:46.143
Bee, when you have graduated
from Harvard Law,

03:46.226 --> 03:48.061
we'll continue this conversation.

03:48.145 --> 03:49.605
But Stanton didn't do it.

03:50.272 --> 03:51.940
-Elizabeth.
-William.

03:52.024 --> 03:53.942
-Is this a good time?
-Of course.

03:54.109 --> 03:55.402
This is my daughter, Bee.

03:55.485 --> 03:56.737
I met you when you were a baby.

03:56.820 --> 03:58.113
Mmm. I've heard the stories.

03:58.447 --> 04:00.324
And I'm not going to law school.

04:00.949 --> 04:02.868
Elizabeth, my apologies.

04:03.076 --> 04:05.787
Bee spends so much time
with her head stuck in novels

04:05.871 --> 04:08.415
that the realities of life
are all the harsher.

04:08.498 --> 04:10.709
Is it true about Stanton? What happened?

04:11.043 --> 04:13.795
He leaked the truth
about my health to the press.

04:14.046 --> 04:16.590
It was damaging to my business
and a personal betrayal.

04:17.216 --> 04:18.592
I'm really sorry to hear that.

04:19.426 --> 04:20.552
How are you?

04:21.553 --> 04:23.347
Well, blood sugar spikes like the market,

04:23.430 --> 04:26.600
ticker's on mile 24,
but screw the doctors.

04:26.850 --> 04:29.228
Now that Patrick's home,
I feel like I'm 40 again.

04:29.311 --> 04:30.854
And? How is he?

04:31.605 --> 04:33.899
Well, he's Patrick.

04:34.650 --> 04:37.069
As you know, art was
the only thing we had in common,

04:37.152 --> 04:39.780
and I'm still hoping
that's a way we can connect.

04:40.906 --> 04:43.534
Liz Mitchell. I'm coming in.

04:43.825 --> 04:45.911
Patrick? Wow.

04:46.745 --> 04:48.622
-You're taller.
-And lost the blue hair.

04:48.830 --> 04:50.040
I like this better.

04:50.249 --> 04:51.917
You are as beautiful as ever.

04:52.376 --> 04:53.377
Oh...

04:53.877 --> 04:56.171
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)

04:56.797 --> 04:59.508
Yeah, that got us kicked out
of the Accademia in Florence.

05:01.093 --> 05:02.761
Wow, you still have your scar, too.

05:03.303 --> 05:04.388
What was that name of the horse again?

05:04.471 --> 05:05.514
-Cheval Chase.
-Yes.

05:05.597 --> 05:07.933
Threw me clear
over the fence at Stonyhill.

05:08.225 --> 05:10.769
Hmm. And that was the first
time I thought I'd lost you.

05:11.395 --> 05:13.438
-I'm gonna go check on Bee.
-Okay.

05:15.774 --> 05:18.443
All right, kid,
I've got a lot of questions.

05:20.404 --> 05:21.405
After Mom died,

05:21.488 --> 05:23.949
I begged Dad to let me stay
in the city with him and Bee.

05:24.783 --> 05:26.577
I was so sad about your mom.

05:27.661 --> 05:30.122
Dad wanted me to go to Le Rosey.

05:30.455 --> 05:32.791
-But I wasn't ready.
-Is that why you ran?

05:32.875 --> 05:34.710
I was tired of living on his terms.

05:34.835 --> 05:36.128
You were just a kid.

05:36.712 --> 05:38.672
-How did you do it?
-Saved my allowance.

05:39.173 --> 05:42.384
On a ski day, I snowboarded
from Zermatt to Cervinia,

05:42.801 --> 05:45.596
sold my gear, hopped on a train,
and never looked back.

05:45.679 --> 05:47.306
You put your family through hell.

05:48.765 --> 05:49.892
What made you come back?

05:49.975 --> 05:51.310
Dad.

05:51.602 --> 05:54.396
Rumors that he was sick
were all over the papers.

05:54.479 --> 05:56.773
I came back for him, not for this life.

05:57.316 --> 05:58.483
He's trying.

05:59.943 --> 06:00.986
By buying me art?

06:01.195 --> 06:02.487
It's his way of bonding.

06:02.988 --> 06:04.656
-Let him.
-Okay.

06:04.990 --> 06:06.325
Well, I remember your tastes.

06:06.700 --> 06:11.872
We have Dutch masters, baroque,
abstract expressionists.

06:11.997 --> 06:13.123
PATRICK: That one.

06:14.666 --> 06:15.876
The Picasso.

06:16.668 --> 06:18.045
<i>The Homme Au Cornet?</i>

06:19.755 --> 06:21.131
I put this in as a joke.

06:23.759 --> 06:25.385
Do you remember the Reina Sofia?

06:25.844 --> 06:30.015
You called <i>Guernica</i> a bastard child
of cubist-surrealist movement

06:30.224 --> 06:33.185
and accused Picasso
of crimes against beauty.

06:34.311 --> 06:35.562
I was a kid.

06:36.355 --> 06:37.648
Tastes change.

06:38.357 --> 06:39.441
You sure?

06:39.942 --> 06:42.528
Yeah. I love it.

06:43.195 --> 06:45.155
Well, I'll have the gallery send it over.

06:49.576 --> 06:50.577

06:58.001 --> 06:59.795

06:59.878 --> 07:01.213
I know this is gonna sound weird,

07:01.296 --> 07:04.967
but I don't think Patrick Wolcott
is Patrick Wolcott.

07:05.217 --> 07:08.136

-So it's possible.

07:11.557 --> 07:13.141
Yeah, missing rich kids are a subset.

07:13.225 --> 07:14.434
You got your Patty Hearsts,

07:14.518 --> 07:17.020
your John Paul Gettys,
<i>Talented Mr. Ripleys.</i>

07:17.688 --> 07:19.523
William Wolcott is a perfect mark.

07:19.731 --> 07:21.608
<i>A very sick, emotionally fragile mark.</i>

07:22.401 --> 07:23.485
Will you look into it?

07:23.569 --> 07:25.696
Yeah. I have to run it by Peter, but...

07:26.029 --> 07:27.364
<i>How he's holding up?</i>

07:27.614 --> 07:29.241
I will find out.

07:31.159 --> 07:32.411
How are you feeling?

07:32.953 --> 07:34.538
Tip-top. Million bucks.

07:35.205 --> 07:36.748
Even if he is a ringer, you're telling me

07:36.832 --> 07:39.334
William Wolcott wouldn't
know his own son?

07:39.418 --> 07:41.420
Emotion is a con man's sweet spot.

07:41.503 --> 07:43.839
And I have good reason to believe
that that is not the real Patrick.

07:43.922 --> 07:45.090
-Better be good.
-It is.

07:45.174 --> 07:46.842
-Better be damn good.
-It is.

07:46.925 --> 07:47.926
Hmm?

07:48.677 --> 07:50.679
Does your wife's intuition count?

07:51.138 --> 07:52.264
El called you?

07:52.347 --> 07:54.266
I did say you guys were
on the friends and family plan.

07:54.558 --> 07:55.559
Oh!

07:56.185 --> 07:59.188
Is this some elaborate ruse
to avoid the Mortensen case?

07:59.271 --> 08:00.355
Okay, that hurts my feelings,

08:00.439 --> 08:03.609
because we're looking at
potential identity theft, fraud.

08:03.692 --> 08:05.110
A family's fortune is at stake,

08:05.194 --> 08:07.070
not to mention the charitable foundation.

08:07.154 --> 08:08.697

08:08.780 --> 08:09.990
Pablo Picasso.

08:10.616 --> 08:13.493
Kid hated his work, and now he's
pushing Elizabeth to buy one.

08:13.660 --> 08:15.746
You want me to
launch into an investigation

08:15.829 --> 08:17.915
based on a Picasso snafu?

08:18.040 --> 08:21.293
Peter, this is like you
suddenly becoming a Red Sox fan.

08:21.668 --> 08:23.462

08:23.879 --> 08:25.255
I'm... You'd have to what?

08:25.714 --> 08:27.132
I'd have to be a different person.

-Thank you.
-It's hot in here.

08:29.134 --> 08:30.469
Yeah, you really don't look good.

08:30.552 --> 08:32.221
-You should go home.
-I'm not going home.

08:32.513 --> 08:35.265
I'm not sick. I've never gone home sick.

08:35.682 --> 08:37.392
You're gonna have to give me
more than Picasso.

08:37.643 --> 08:41.146
Also suspicious, Mr. Wolcott fired
his butler of over 30 years.

08:41.230 --> 08:43.065
-Good help is hard to find.
-Or he was set up.

08:43.148 --> 08:44.691
The smart move is to jettison

08:44.775 --> 08:46.818
anyone who intimately knew
the real Patrick.

08:47.444 --> 08:48.904
We'd need a DNA test.

08:49.404 --> 08:51.031
His father hasn't ordered one.

08:52.282 --> 08:53.992
But Elizabeth could grab a hair
when she's over there.

08:54.076 --> 08:56.286

my wife in as a secret agent.

08:56.411 --> 08:57.746
-So send me in.
-How?

08:57.871 --> 08:59.164

-I can buttle.
-Buttle?

09:38.662 --> 09:39.955
Excuse me.

09:40.706 --> 09:42.457
One pours from the right.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.835
Always from the right. May I?

09:47.004 --> 09:48.505
-Are you feeling warm, sir?
-I am.

09:48.589 --> 09:50.048
But I've got my own, thanks.

09:50.174 --> 09:53.093
Stanton, you're not under investigation,

09:53.177 --> 09:55.179
but we do have questions about Patrick.

09:55.596 --> 09:58.098
Do you have any reason
to believe this isn't him?

09:58.515 --> 10:00.184
He's grown, of course.

10:00.517 --> 10:02.519
But the mannerisms...

10:02.686 --> 10:05.063
If it isn't, he's a brilliant study.

10:05.189 --> 10:07.649
If he is a fraud,
you could have exposed him.

10:08.358 --> 10:09.359
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

10:10.694 --> 10:12.613
He might have sabotaged you.

10:12.905 --> 10:14.823
PETER: We need physical evidence.

10:14.907 --> 10:18.619
A DNA mismatch would prove
he isn't a Wolcott.

10:18.702 --> 10:20.120
Thanks to Elizabeth's recommendation,

10:20.204 --> 10:22.122
William hired me as your replacement.

10:24.374 --> 10:26.543
Excuse me. You?

10:26.627 --> 10:28.587
Rhett Carlyle, domestic artist.

10:28.670 --> 10:30.923
He buttled in a castle in Hampshire.

10:31.507 --> 10:33.175
-It's a verb.
-I am aware.

10:35.219 --> 10:37.054
How long did you work in Hampshire?

10:37.221 --> 10:38.514
Till he was caught with a princess.

10:38.597 --> 10:40.432
Suspected. Never caught.

10:40.974 --> 10:43.393
But the evidence was overwhelming.

10:43.936 --> 10:45.145
I didn't steal the silverware.

10:45.229 --> 10:48.732
There is more to private service
than consorting with the landed gentry.

10:49.483 --> 10:52.945
In addition to scheduling
valet and chauffeur duties,

10:53.070 --> 10:55.489
one needs to develop
an acute sense of observation.

10:55.572 --> 10:58.825

not a shine, lattice-laced.

10:58.909 --> 11:00.160

11:00.244 --> 11:02.454

of pouring from the right.

11:02.538 --> 11:05.082
And, Peter... Peter.

11:05.958 --> 11:06.959
Yes.

11:07.584 --> 11:10.754
Muscle fatigue, dry lips,
watery eyes, nausea...

11:11.463 --> 11:13.674
I am a brilliant study,
and this man has the flu,

11:13.757 --> 11:15.050
so you might want to keep your distance.

11:16.552 --> 11:19.930
My life's work has been
protecting that family.

11:20.764 --> 11:22.015
I want that to matter.

11:22.599 --> 11:24.852
Then tell me everything I need to know

11:24.935 --> 11:27.020

11:41.994 --> 11:44.997
There's a reading of
<i>Franny and Zooey</i> at the 92nd Street Y.

11:45.330 --> 11:47.082
I managed to secure you two tickets.

11:47.624 --> 11:49.209

May I take your helmet, sir?

12:09.688 --> 12:11.523
No, I am gonna fix the strap.

12:11.773 --> 12:12.983
May I take your jacket?

12:13.233 --> 12:14.568
No, I got it.

12:15.319 --> 12:16.528
You must be thirsty.

12:20.532 --> 12:22.534
My father thinks people need servants.

12:22.618 --> 12:24.995
I don't. I can take care of myself.

12:25.078 --> 12:26.371

12:50.562 --> 12:52.856
-Elizabeth, good morning.
-Good morning, William.

12:53.023 --> 12:54.358
-Carlyle.
-Good morning, Mrs. Burke.

12:54.566 --> 12:56.735
Carlyle is wonderful.
Where did you get him?

12:56.818 --> 12:59.238
He actually worked for a family
that I'm very close to.

12:59.571 --> 13:02.366
The Picasso's coming this morning,
and I have a De La Tour to show you.

13:02.658 --> 13:03.867

21:54.731 --> 21:56.775
-Hey, what's up?
-Oh, hey. Yeah.

21:57.484 --> 21:58.694
How's life on Golden Pond?

22:00.362 --> 22:01.989
Oh, and I see you opened the Brunello.

22:02.447 --> 22:04.241
Oh, yeah, I saved you...

22:06.952 --> 22:08.787
-Enjoy.
-Thanks.

22:10.372 --> 22:12.291
-Moz.
-Oh.

22:12.374 --> 22:14.710
For once I'm not the only one
in the room with a buzz.

22:14.960 --> 22:16.587
It's loud for one hive.

22:16.670 --> 22:18.672
I may have acquired three.

22:18.755 --> 22:21.800
Skinny Gianetta got nabbed,
so his wife put out feelers.

22:21.884 --> 22:25.053
So in addition to me being undercover
as a butler and taking care of Peter,

22:25.137 --> 22:26.847
I'm now the guardian of orphan bees.

22:27.181 --> 22:28.640
What ails the Suit?

22:29.266 --> 22:31.268
It's that flu that's going around.

22:31.560 --> 22:32.936
That's perfect.

22:33.770 --> 22:36.481
It seems fitting
that a man of his persuasion

22:36.648 --> 22:39.276
should be my guinea pig.

22:40.319 --> 22:43.989
Eighteen amino acids packed
into an antimicrobial,

22:44.072 --> 22:46.033
flavonoid-filled, honey-based tonic

22:46.200 --> 22:47.701
that will rid you of your symptoms

22:47.826 --> 22:50.996
and also cure warts, elevate your mood,

22:51.496 --> 22:53.832
and enhance performance.

22:55.667 --> 22:57.002
Thank me later.

22:57.169 --> 22:58.504
-Or don't. Don't.
-Don't.

23:02.341 --> 23:03.800
I'm supposed to drink this?

23:03.884 --> 23:06.178
One now, the second in two hours,

23:06.386 --> 23:09.056
and the third
within four hours of the first.

23:09.139 --> 23:10.974
I must be crazy to even consider this.

23:11.058 --> 23:12.392
Could you feel any worse?

23:12.893 --> 23:14.061
Probably not.

23:18.815 --> 23:20.400
I got to get to the Wolcotts.

23:20.484 --> 23:21.860
Feel better, Peter.

23:22.402 --> 23:23.612
I'll stay here and observe.

23:24.863 --> 23:26.532
Observe what? What's gonna happen?

23:26.990 --> 23:29.910
Well, the first 15 minutes...
Well, let's see.

23:38.669 --> 23:41.797
-WILLIAM: Well, it's going to happen.
-Dad, it's not what I want.

23:41.880 --> 23:43.465
It's what I want. Consider that.

23:43.549 --> 23:45.425
My attorney is sending it over.

23:46.051 --> 23:47.052
(PATRICK SIGHS)

23:47.845 --> 23:49.972
-May I take your cup?
-No.

23:52.933 --> 23:53.934
No.

23:57.271 --> 23:59.189
So this conversation's over.

23:59.398 --> 24:00.566
In my mind it is.

24:01.066 --> 24:02.568
Let's talk about something else.

24:03.694 --> 24:07.865
Did you know that Picasso used
to burn his own work for warmth?

24:07.948 --> 24:09.741
-That's right. He did.
-(DOORBELL RINGING)

24:13.662 --> 24:14.746
Sir.

24:19.209 --> 24:20.419
This was a mistake.

24:20.919 --> 24:23.505
It was supposed to go
to the business manager.

24:23.589 --> 24:24.673
Here you go.

24:31.638 --> 24:33.265
-Thank you.
-Good afternoon.

24:38.312 --> 24:41.023
Time for vial number two.

24:41.690 --> 24:42.858
Where'd Mozzie go?

24:43.108 --> 24:44.985
He needed to check on his queen.

24:46.195 --> 24:47.821
Assuming he meant bee, but with him...

24:47.905 --> 24:49.072
You never know.

24:54.453 --> 24:55.746
This came for you.

24:55.829 --> 24:58.165
I can't open it. It's for William Wolcott.

24:58.373 --> 24:59.917
But it's addressed to Peter Burke.

25:00.709 --> 25:03.128
You know, I think your wife

25:03.212 --> 25:05.964
had to open it for you
because you're extremely sick.

25:07.341 --> 25:10.969
Besides, no one will ever know.

25:12.137 --> 25:13.472
We can just reseal it.

25:13.555 --> 25:16.058
-Neal's a very bad influence on you.
-(CHUCKLES)

25:19.561 --> 25:22.064
-Oh, yes.
-Wow. That was perfect.

25:22.147 --> 25:23.148
Mmm-hmm.

25:23.232 --> 25:26.109
Neal found out what Patrick's after,
a trust fund.

25:27.319 --> 25:29.530
He was supposed to inherit it
when he was 21.

25:30.113 --> 25:32.783
They're redoing the paperwork today.

25:33.575 --> 25:35.077
-Forty million dollars.
-Yeah.

25:35.410 --> 25:37.246
Honey, if he gets that,
he's gonna disappear.

25:37.329 --> 25:39.039
William's heart can't take that.

25:39.122 --> 25:40.541
-I got to let him know what's going on.
-No.

25:40.624 --> 25:44.711
Bring William to the FBI.
I want to talk to him.

25:45.045 --> 25:47.548
I'm not sure
what this Patrick is capable of.

25:47.631 --> 25:48.715
He could be dangerous.

25:48.799 --> 25:51.051
Babe, look, this is
a hard conversation to have

25:51.134 --> 25:52.970
with a father,
and it needs to come from a friend.

25:53.053 --> 25:54.638
Besides, you need to take it easy.

25:54.763 --> 25:55.889
No, I don't want to take it easy.

25:55.973 --> 25:57.432
-I feel better.
-Well, that's great.

25:57.724 --> 25:59.726
I'll let you know how it goes
at the Wolcotts', okay?

26:00.143 --> 26:02.771
Besides, I want you to lay down.

26:09.945 --> 26:12.114
ELIZABETH: William,
I'm not trying to upset you.

26:12.322 --> 26:14.867
Being married to an FBI agent
has made you cynical.

26:14.950 --> 26:16.118
It's time for your Insulin, sir.

26:16.368 --> 26:18.954
This has nothing to do with Peter, okay?
I was fooled, too.

26:19.037 --> 26:20.372
I'm offended, Elizabeth!

26:20.497 --> 26:21.665
The whole house can hear you.

26:21.748 --> 26:22.749
This is ridiculous.

26:22.833 --> 26:25.127
Patrick should have no problem
consenting to a blood test.

26:25.210 --> 26:26.670
You don't believe me?

26:27.212 --> 26:29.256
Fine. Draw the blood right now.

26:29.339 --> 26:30.674
I don't need this, Patrick.

26:31.675 --> 26:34.303
She does.
How many others think you're a fool?

26:37.347 --> 26:39.308
I won't stick a needle into my own son.

26:40.184 --> 26:41.602
Okay.

26:41.894 --> 26:43.061
I'll do it.

26:53.530 --> 26:54.740
There.

26:56.283 --> 26:57.492
Test it.

27:12.883 --> 27:15.052
JONES: The house is equidistant
from the avenues,

27:15.135 --> 27:16.595
but we don't want him to get that far.

27:16.887 --> 27:19.932
Entry and exit points of the
Wolcott residence, upper windows, too.

27:20.224 --> 27:23.310
We're gonna have three agents
by the utility van, two more undercover...

27:23.477 --> 27:24.561
Three more.

27:26.480 --> 27:28.690
Look, Peter, you're a biohazard.

27:28.857 --> 27:31.276
I'm on the mend.
(CLEARS THROAT) I swear.

27:31.485 --> 27:33.695
And after this...

27:34.738 --> 27:36.740
-What is it?
-I don't know.

27:36.865 --> 27:39.409
-Mozzie gave it to me.
-Oh, God.

27:42.746 --> 27:43.747
(GAGS)

27:44.289 --> 27:45.457
It works.

27:45.791 --> 27:48.168
I'm in on this bust. My wife is in there.

27:51.421 --> 27:53.257
PETER: When it all goes down,
we'll move in for the arrest.

27:53.340 --> 27:55.592
Good boy. Come on, Chauncey.

27:56.218 --> 27:58.929
-Looks like Mozzie's tincture's working.
-(GROANS)

27:59.012 --> 28:00.597
I'm coming off the DL.

28:00.889 --> 28:02.558
Baseball. Disabled list.

28:02.933 --> 28:04.810
Did you check out the lab
they used to test the blood?

28:04.977 --> 28:06.061
It's reputable.

28:06.228 --> 28:08.897
I put an agent there
in case Patrick tried anything.

28:09.815 --> 28:11.692
William had the sample
picked up from the house.

28:11.817 --> 28:14.111
I sealed it and handed it
to the technician myself.

28:14.444 --> 28:16.029
So Patrick didn't tamper with it.

28:16.238 --> 28:19.533
No, but I'm sure he has something planned
when the DNA comes back a mismatch.

28:19.867 --> 28:21.869
I want to know what it is. Audio.

28:23.203 --> 28:25.080
-Check one, two.
-(OVER MICROPHONE) <i>Check one, two.</i>

28:27.457 --> 28:28.709
I'll keep an eye on Elizabeth.

28:30.210 --> 28:32.045
Come on, Chaunce. Come on.

28:32.254 --> 28:33.505
That's a good boy.

28:38.886 --> 28:40.846
Everything all right, Miss Bee?

28:41.096 --> 28:42.514
The blood tests are back.

28:44.016 --> 28:47.311
What we have here, Carlyle,
is a real moment of truth.

28:49.313 --> 28:52.482
Everyone, I have news,
and you need to hear it.

28:53.066 --> 28:56.320
You've all been working very hard
to prepare for the party on Sunday,

28:56.570 --> 28:58.488
but there's been a change of plans.

28:59.198 --> 29:02.618
The celebration will now
take place tomorrow.

29:03.202 --> 29:06.705
I don't want to wait any
longer to welcome home my son.

29:08.707 --> 29:10.167
I'm so glad to be back.

29:11.502 --> 29:13.295
I shouldn't have put you through this.

29:13.378 --> 29:14.505
The DNA was a match.

29:14.588 --> 29:17.841
Also I want to thank Elizabeth
for all that she's done.

29:18.258 --> 29:20.219
Today is her last day.

29:21.178 --> 29:22.387
William, I'm sorry.

29:22.638 --> 29:24.389
You know I was just
thinking of you and Bee.

29:24.473 --> 29:26.975
The days I have left
with my son are numbered.

29:27.059 --> 29:30.562
Forcing him to do this,
he could have walked out the door,

29:30.729 --> 29:32.564
and it would have been your fault.

29:32.898 --> 29:34.691
I'll send your check.

29:38.237 --> 29:40.322
What did I do? (SIGHS)

29:47.454 --> 29:48.455
Oh.

29:48.872 --> 29:52.251
Well, I'm fired,
and you don't have to be a butler anymore.

29:52.459 --> 29:53.710
I can't just leave.

29:54.670 --> 29:57.548
Maybe I'll see how French
that maid really is.

29:59.716 --> 30:03.846
Liz. I tried to talk to my father,
but you know how stubborn he is.

30:03.929 --> 30:05.806
Well, he's upset with me,
and I can understand that.

30:05.889 --> 30:07.349
I already took Chauncey on his walk.

30:07.432 --> 30:08.433
Oh, uh...

30:08.600 --> 30:10.394
Well, I heard him coughing.

30:10.477 --> 30:11.603
I'm gonna take him to the vet.

30:11.854 --> 30:13.689
ELIZABETH: Well, if he's not feeling well,
he shouldn't walk.

30:13.772 --> 30:15.691
-It's not far.
-It is if he can't breathe.

30:15.774 --> 30:17.943
Don't worry. I'll drive them.

30:18.902 --> 30:19.945
I'll get the car.

30:20.028 --> 30:21.238
Good day, Mrs. Burke.

30:22.155 --> 30:23.907
Take care, Patrick.

30:25.576 --> 30:27.077
You too, Liz.

31:00.777 --> 31:01.862
NEAL: <i>Hey, Peter.</i>

31:01.945 --> 31:04.531
Patrick hates the dog.
Now he's bringing it to the vet.

31:04.615 --> 31:05.616
PETER: <i>I heard. You're wired.</i>

31:05.866 --> 31:07.951
You've gone from <i>My Man Godfrey</i>
to <i>Ace Ventura.</i>

31:08.160 --> 31:09.661
I'm telling you, he's got another move.

31:09.995 --> 31:12.789
Neal, recon only.

31:12.998 --> 31:14.750
<i>You find anything, you pull me in.</i>

31:14.917 --> 31:16.084
You got it.

31:49.826 --> 31:50.869
-Hey.
-Hey.

31:50.953 --> 31:53.372
I feel good. Really good.

31:53.622 --> 31:55.374
Great. You and the Wolcotts' dog.

31:55.541 --> 31:57.167
Patrick went to the vet for himself.

31:57.417 --> 31:59.503
I watched the tech remove something
from his arm, right here.

31:59.586 --> 32:00.629
-Plastic?
-Yeah.

32:00.712 --> 32:02.422
-Look like a vein?
-I don't know.

32:02.506 --> 32:04.299
It was about 2/3 this size.

32:04.383 --> 32:05.843
That's a Penrose drain.

32:05.968 --> 32:07.135
There was a case in Florida,

32:07.219 --> 32:10.138
a guy implanted one to fool a DNA test.

32:10.639 --> 32:12.474
-Filled with someone else's blood?
-Yeah.

32:12.975 --> 32:14.726
That's why Patrick drew his own.

32:15.018 --> 32:16.270
This blood was fresh.

32:16.645 --> 32:21.525
Which means 48 hours ago
the real Patrick Wolcott was alive.

32:21.608 --> 32:22.734
And in New York.

32:22.818 --> 32:24.361
You know, we're kind of good at this.

32:24.444 --> 32:25.487
What?

32:26.530 --> 32:29.199
William's signing over
the trust fund tomorrow.

32:30.742 --> 32:33.161
And once fake Patrick gets what he wants,

32:34.663 --> 32:36.707
he won't have any reason to keep
the real Patrick around.

32:36.790 --> 32:37.833
No.

32:49.720 --> 32:50.721
JONES: We pulled in the vet tech.

32:50.971 --> 32:52.806
Of course he denies
implanting a Penrose drain.

32:53.390 --> 32:55.517
We searched the property.
No signs of the tubing.

32:55.684 --> 32:58.103
But we're holding him on suspicion
so he can't tip Patrick off?

32:58.187 --> 32:59.771
You better believe it.

32:59.855 --> 33:02.274
Well, we won't get a warrant
for another DNA testing

33:02.357 --> 33:04.151
without permission from the family.

33:04.234 --> 33:06.904
Why don't we just grab the bastard
and tell him we know about the drain?

33:07.112 --> 33:08.697
Tempting, but we have no leverage.

33:08.864 --> 33:10.115
So let's get some leverage.

33:10.199 --> 33:11.992
-How do we do that?
-Hmm.

33:13.202 --> 33:14.411
Picasso.

33:15.370 --> 33:16.955
Yeah, yeah, Picasso.

33:20.209 --> 33:23.587
All right, our imposter learned
everything he could about Patrick's life.

33:23.670 --> 33:25.297
But he didn't know
Elizabeth's Picasso story,

33:25.380 --> 33:26.673
which proves he doesn't know everything.

33:26.757 --> 33:28.509
Yeah, and he doesn't know
what he doesn't know.

33:28.592 --> 33:31.303
We need to ask him something
that he thinks

33:31.386 --> 33:33.555
only the real Patrick knows the answer to.

33:33.722 --> 33:35.432
And give him a reason to get that answer.

33:35.599 --> 33:37.851
Elizabeth asks him about Picasso,

33:37.935 --> 33:39.811
the next morning he knows everything.

33:41.563 --> 33:42.814
The bike rides.

33:43.190 --> 33:45.400
<i>He goes on one every morning.</i>
<i>It's always for an hour.</i>

33:45.526 --> 33:47.027
That's got to be how
he's keeping Patrick alive.

33:47.110 --> 33:49.488
-And how he got the Picasso story.
-And the blood.

33:49.655 --> 33:51.865
Jones, get a radius set up in op.

33:51.949 --> 33:53.408
Car, bike, foot, whatever.

33:53.534 --> 33:55.744
Make sure we stay on him
wherever he goes.

33:55.827 --> 33:56.912
JONES: Gotcha.

33:58.580 --> 34:00.457
Patrick was gone for 15 years.

34:00.582 --> 34:02.543
He probably didn't meet
the imposter right away.

34:02.626 --> 34:04.419
The first time he was spotted
after he ran away

34:04.503 --> 34:06.296
from boarding school was at Dusseldorf.

34:06.380 --> 34:08.674
NEAL: And that's where
Leo Kovak comes in.

34:08.757 --> 34:09.925
Who is Leo Kovak?

34:10.008 --> 34:12.511
He's the reason fake Patrick
has to get the answer.

34:12.594 --> 34:14.263
Who is Leo Kovak?

34:15.639 --> 34:16.723
I'm Leo Kovak?

34:16.807 --> 34:19.768
You are a very angry Croatian.

34:19.852 --> 34:21.353
You work for the Von Kesslers,

34:21.436 --> 34:23.689
and you want to know what the
hell happened in Dusseldorf.

34:23.772 --> 34:25.232
What happened in Dusseldorf?

34:25.649 --> 34:27.901
It's got to be more convincing.

34:27.985 --> 34:29.945
-What happened in Dusseldorf?
-Nothing.

34:30.279 --> 34:31.613
But Patrick doesn't know that.

34:32.155 --> 34:33.240
Croatians invented neckties,

34:33.323 --> 34:34.491
and I'm sure you've got
something in your closet

34:34.575 --> 34:36.076
that screams enraged Balkan.

34:36.243 --> 34:38.620
I can't do Croatian. I'm going Polish.

34:39.079 --> 34:40.622
Let's pick out that tie.

34:47.546 --> 34:49.673
Mr. Kovak is here to see you.

34:50.507 --> 34:52.843
I'm a friend of the Von Kesslers.

34:53.969 --> 34:56.597
Of course. The Von Kesslers.

34:56.847 --> 34:59.057
It's been a while since Dusseldorf.

34:59.141 --> 35:00.350
PATRICK: Thank you, Carlyle.

35:07.357 --> 35:11.570
I followed you and your story
in the papers, Patrick.

35:13.405 --> 35:15.199
That's how we found you.

35:16.200 --> 35:19.286
-I'm sorry. Do I...
-You should be sorry for what you did.

35:20.829 --> 35:23.790
-Sir, I don't understand.
-Don't play stupid.

35:24.458 --> 35:26.043
Don't start crying.

35:26.210 --> 35:29.338
The Von Kesslers pay me
to handle their problems.

35:32.466 --> 35:36.929
Is there any way I can
pay them for this inconvenience?

35:37.012 --> 35:39.473
You think you can put
a price on what you did?

35:39.556 --> 35:41.433
That money can make this go away?

35:41.517 --> 35:44.770
-No. They want answers.
-(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

35:47.064 --> 35:49.024
Compliments of the chef.

35:50.400 --> 35:51.443
Anything else, sir?

35:51.527 --> 35:53.779
A pen and something to write.

36:05.958 --> 36:09.127
Call me. We can make Dusseldorf go away.

36:11.255 --> 36:15.050
But if you don't,
I'll see you at your party tonight.

36:16.051 --> 36:17.845
I'll show myself out.

36:22.391 --> 36:24.017
If I may, sir...

36:27.229 --> 36:29.565
That threat didn't sound hollow.

36:30.482 --> 36:32.526
I'm going for a bike ride.

36:33.819 --> 36:35.571
Enjoy the fresh air.

36:45.789 --> 36:48.292
He's exiting the park
at Morningside and 116th.

36:53.755 --> 36:54.798
I've got him.

37:00.220 --> 37:02.264
I wouldn't peg you for a fed in this car.

37:02.931 --> 37:04.558
Perimeter is all set.

37:05.142 --> 37:07.019
We'll pinch Patrick at the location.

37:07.477 --> 37:09.646
While we're waiting, may I, uh...

37:16.612 --> 37:17.654
Thanks, Leo.

37:23.619 --> 37:25.329
North on Manhattan. Handing off.

37:29.499 --> 37:30.501
(ENGINE STARTS)

37:31.168 --> 37:33.003
(ENGINE REVVING)

37:33.337 --> 37:34.922
Listen to that!

37:43.889 --> 37:45.349
Hard turn, 114th.

37:50.562 --> 37:51.563
(YELLS)

37:52.105 --> 37:53.106
(GROANS)

37:53.315 --> 37:55.359
JONES: <i>Agent down! We lost the suspect!</i>

37:57.986 --> 37:59.029
Neal, get out.

37:59.112 --> 38:01.406
I'm a butler. I'm trained for this.

38:01.532 --> 38:02.574
(TIRES SQUEALING)

38:10.624 --> 38:11.625
PETER: Call an ambulance.

38:11.708 --> 38:14.586
All agents to First Avenue
and 114th street.

38:15.045 --> 38:17.339
Agent Burke and Caffrey are en route.

38:17.422 --> 38:19.550
JONES: <i>Team two has him. West on 116th.</i>

38:19.633 --> 38:20.801
This is 116th.

38:21.426 --> 38:22.469
Neal.

38:25.138 --> 38:26.557
-Neal.
-Don't look.

38:27.015 --> 38:28.725
I have to look. I can't help it.

38:31.103 --> 38:32.437
There he goes.

38:37.734 --> 38:41.321
Lost sight of the suspect
at the corner of Morningside and 115th.

38:43.365 --> 38:44.700
That must be some butler college.

38:47.703 --> 38:49.538
(BRAKES SQUEALING)

38:52.499 --> 38:54.001
Where's he keeping Patrick?

38:55.127 --> 38:57.254
He was just here.
Got to be somewhere close.

38:57.754 --> 39:00.340
PETER: All right, we're gonna
have to go door to door.

39:00.549 --> 39:03.260
I want a team on this building,
down there,

39:03.468 --> 39:05.304
and a team across the street.

39:05.762 --> 39:06.930
JONES: Team two, let's go.

39:09.224 --> 39:11.727
-Hey, Peter.
-Yeah, what do you have?

39:14.771 --> 39:16.023
This may be a long shot,

39:16.106 --> 39:19.443
but Patrick said he dropped
his travel journal in the Aegean.

39:20.152 --> 39:22.738
Not exactly the Aegean,
but let's have a look.

39:36.502 --> 39:38.670
PATRICK:
For the last time, Dusseldorf.

39:38.962 --> 39:40.130
What the hell happened?

39:40.214 --> 39:41.548
REAL PATRICK: Nothing happened
in Dusseldorf.

39:41.632 --> 39:42.883
PATRICK: The Von Kesslers are pissed,

39:42.966 --> 39:45.177
and this Kovaks guy is coming after you.

39:45.260 --> 39:46.678
I don't know any of these people.

39:46.762 --> 39:49.473
Okay, fine. Fine.

39:49.890 --> 39:51.391
We'll do this the hard way.

39:51.934 --> 39:54.811
The hard way is what's gonna happen
if you don't put that taser down.

39:54.937 --> 39:56.605
Peter Burke, FBI.

39:56.772 --> 39:58.023
Cuff him.

40:01.026 --> 40:03.153
-I'm not a butler.
-MAN 1: Let's go.

40:10.118 --> 40:12.746
Everything's gonna be okay, all right?

40:20.170 --> 40:21.797
-Patrick.
-Dad.

40:33.058 --> 40:37.396
I wanted him to be you so much,
I let myself believe.

40:38.856 --> 40:40.190
I'm sorry.

40:40.816 --> 40:42.693
I'm sorry I let him into our lives.

40:45.821 --> 40:46.905
Liz.

40:47.948 --> 40:49.032
Hi.

40:52.661 --> 40:53.745
Bee?

40:54.913 --> 40:58.208
You should know,
I'm used to being an only child.

40:58.667 --> 40:59.668
(CHUCKLES)

41:20.022 --> 41:24.401
PETER: <i>Patrick and Keith,</i>
<i>that's his real name, met on Santorini.</i>

41:24.943 --> 41:26.945
<i>People said they could pass for brothers.</i>

41:27.362 --> 41:29.698
When Patrick decided to come home,

41:29.781 --> 41:31.992
Keith offered to come with him.

41:32.159 --> 41:35.662
He took Patrick hostage,
read his journals.

41:35.829 --> 41:37.372
That man stole his life.

41:37.456 --> 41:38.916
And now he's got it back again.

41:39.249 --> 41:41.210
-Thanks to you.
-Thanks to us.

41:43.921 --> 41:46.006
Are you up for some...

41:46.089 --> 41:47.466
Some baseball?

41:47.549 --> 41:48.759
-A night game?
-Yeah.

41:48.842 --> 41:50.719
I figured we could pick up
where we left off.

41:50.969 --> 41:52.679
I could probably...

41:53.096 --> 41:54.097
Hmm.

41:55.724 --> 41:57.809
-Oh, no.
-Damn it.

41:58.310 --> 42:00.812
-I'll call Mozzie.
-Wait, wait, wait, hold on.

42:01.271 --> 42:04.525
If you've had this flu already,
I think we're safe.
