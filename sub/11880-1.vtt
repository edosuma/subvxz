04:10.917 --> 04:12.251
Claire.

04:27.392 --> 04:28.850
I miss you.

05:36.669 --> 05:40.255
Dr. Weir report te the Lewis & Clark
in Docking Bay 4.

05:58.024 --> 06:00.400
- Ion drive set.
- Thank you.

06:02.445 --> 06:06.073
Heading: Vector One, nine degrees.

06:10.912 --> 06:14.081
We are prepped for lockdown.

06:17.794 --> 06:20.295
I can't believe it, this is ridiculous.

06:20.380 --> 06:25.300
I haven't got more than my hand
in the last six weeks, and now this shit.

06:25.385 --> 06:27.511
I mean,
why can't we go to Mars, Captain?

06:27.595 --> 06:32.015
- I mean, Mars has got women.
- Smith's right.

06:32.100 --> 06:33.767
Neptune, there's nothing out there.

06:33.851 --> 06:36.103
Yeah, and if the shit goes down,
we'll be on our own.

06:36.187 --> 06:37.896
You know the rules, people.

06:37.980 --> 06:42.025
Someone drops the ball, we get the call.
Now, let's go.

06:42.527 --> 06:44.236
- Have you got our course plotted in?
- Yes, sir.

06:44.320 --> 06:47.364
- Locked and cocked and ready to rock.
- Mr. Justin?

06:48.491 --> 06:50.075
Everything's green on my screen,
Skipper.

06:50.159 --> 06:51.326
Start your countdown now.

06:51.411 --> 06:54.496
Ion drive will engage
in T minus 10 minutes.

06:54.580 --> 06:56.289
Thank you, Lieutenant.

06:56.374 --> 06:57.541
Let's go.

06:57.625 --> 07:00.460
- Smith, you follow me.
- Yes, ma'am.

07:00.545 --> 07:03.588
- Justin, get those tanks prepped.
- Yes, sir.

07:07.510 --> 07:09.219
- Mr. Cooper.
- Skipper.

07:09.303 --> 07:12.639
- Ion drive in 10 minutes.
- It's time to play spam-in-the-can.

07:12.723 --> 07:15.308
- Skipper.
- Peters.

07:16.060 --> 07:18.186
Captain Miller,
I just wanted to say this is something...

07:18.271 --> 07:20.397
Clock is ticking, Doctor.

07:22.191 --> 07:24.484
You waiting for a personal invitation,
there, Mr. Smith?

07:24.569 --> 07:26.236
- No, sir.
- Captain, I don't want to take up...

07:26.320 --> 07:29.114
Doctor, if you'll just follow
the rest of the crew to the grav tanks,

07:29.198 --> 07:30.449
we're almost underway.

07:30.533 --> 07:32.451
That bunk better be squared away,
Mr. Cooper,

07:32.535 --> 07:34.244
or you'll find yourself walking
to Neptune.

07:34.328 --> 07:35.620
What's the hold-up, Peters?

07:35.705 --> 07:38.623
Just loading
the last of the CO2 scrubbers, sir.

07:38.791 --> 07:40.667
You stand right here.

07:43.504 --> 07:44.754
Thanks, D.J.

07:45.089 --> 07:46.506
- Hats off in the tank.
- Sir.

07:46.591 --> 07:49.259
- First time in a grav couch?
- Yeah.

07:51.137 --> 07:54.473
I think your captain
has some kind of a problem with me.

07:54.557 --> 07:56.766
Oh, well. Don't worry about him.

07:56.851 --> 07:59.269
He just loves having complete strangers
on his ship.

07:59.353 --> 08:01.229
- D.J.
- Yeah.

08:03.733 --> 08:04.816
No.

08:04.901 --> 08:06.818
Is this necessary?

08:06.903 --> 08:10.822
When the ion drive fires,
you'll be taking about 30 G's.

08:11.574 --> 08:15.160
Without a tank,
the force would liquety your skeleton.

08:16.496 --> 08:19.080
I've seen the effect on mice.

08:22.877 --> 08:24.294
Claustrophobic?

08:24.837 --> 08:26.046
Very.

08:50.738 --> 08:52.155
Biiiy.

09:34.991 --> 09:37.951
I'm so aione.

09:40.871 --> 09:42.122
Hello?

09:51.257 --> 09:52.966
Is anyone there?

10:02.852 --> 10:03.852
Oh, God.

10:36.886 --> 10:39.012
Biiiy?

10:40.556 --> 10:42.223
I'm so coid.

10:52.026 --> 10:53.443
Claire.

10:56.072 --> 10:58.031
I'm waiting.

11:10.086 --> 11:13.296
You're all right. Breathe. D.J.!

11:14.423 --> 11:16.341
- Okay, Dr. Weir, let's get you up.
- Okay, I'm fine.

11:16.425 --> 11:17.676
- Come on, take it easy.
- I'm fine.

11:17.760 --> 11:20.428
Okay. There you go.

11:21.263 --> 11:24.683
Now move nice and slow.
You've been in stasis for 56 days.

11:24.767 --> 11:27.477
You're gonna experience
a little disorientation, you understand?

11:27.561 --> 11:31.314
- I'm all right now, thank you.
- Okay, take that. Don't rush it.

11:31.607 --> 11:33.274
All yours.

11:37.113 --> 11:38.780
You okay, Doc?

11:39.782 --> 11:42.450
- Want some coffee?
- What?

11:43.327 --> 11:45.995
Would you like some coffee?

11:47.164 --> 11:49.499
No. Thank you.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.502
All right, suit yourself.

11:52.628 --> 11:54.045
What about you, Starck?

11:54.130 --> 11:56.965
Would you like
something hot and black inside you?

11:57.508 --> 11:59.509
- Is that an offer?
- It is not.

11:59.635 --> 12:02.762
- Then how about some coffee?
- Starck?

12:02.847 --> 12:05.056
- Yes, sir.
- Why aren't you on the bridge?

12:05.141 --> 12:06.391
Do you mind if I get dressed first?

12:06.475 --> 12:09.227
As a matter of fact, Lieutenant,
I do mind if you get dressed first.

12:09.311 --> 12:11.730
Let's go, people. We have a job to do.

12:12.189 --> 12:15.734
Okay, Denny, here we go.
Happy birthday.

12:15.818 --> 12:18.027
Piay horsey, Mommy. Piay horsey.

12:18.154 --> 12:20.488
Hey, no more ball in the house.

12:21.449 --> 12:23.491
You're the one who can't catch.

12:23.617 --> 12:27.495
- Yo, apologize.
- Sorry about that, Mama Bear.

12:27.621 --> 12:29.080
- All right.
- All right, then.

12:29.165 --> 12:31.040
- Peters.
- Yes, sir.

12:31.625 --> 12:33.918
I did try to find a replacement for you,

12:34.003 --> 12:36.755
but with such short notice,
it was impossible.

12:36.839 --> 12:38.214
I am sorry.

12:38.340 --> 12:42.260
I talked to my ex.
He's going to take Denny for Christmas.

12:42.344 --> 12:45.472
I'll get him for the summer, so

12:45.556 --> 12:47.223
everything's all right.

12:47.475 --> 12:48.850
Smitty.

12:49.185 --> 12:51.060
Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen,

12:51.145 --> 12:52.937
in approximately
2 hours and 23 minutes,

12:53.022 --> 12:56.065
we'll be arriving in the orbit of Neptune.
Thank you very much.

12:56.150 --> 12:58.359
- I thank you.
- That's good.

12:58.486 --> 13:01.279
All boards are green.
Everything's five by five.

13:01.363 --> 13:03.907
- U.S.A.C. Been notified of our position?
- Yes, sir.

13:03.991 --> 13:05.742
- All right, people, listen up.
- D.J.

13:05.826 --> 13:07.911
As you all know,
we have an addition to our crew.

13:07.995 --> 13:10.330
Dr. Weir, you care to join us?

13:10.998 --> 13:14.501
Introductions all around.
This is my XO, Lieutenant Starck.

13:14.585 --> 13:16.252
Mr. Justin, Engineering.

13:16.378 --> 13:18.004
The funky spaceman over here
is Mr. Cooper.

13:18.088 --> 13:20.298
What exactly is it you do
on board this ship, Coop?

13:20.382 --> 13:23.051
Listen up, Doc,
I'm your best friend, okay?

13:23.177 --> 13:25.512
I am the lifesaver and the heartbreaker.

13:25.596 --> 13:27.430
He's a rescue technician.

13:27.556 --> 13:31.601
This is Peters, medical technician.
And my pilot, Mr. Smith.

13:33.062 --> 13:35.230
The gloomy Gus
in the corner over there, that's...

13:35.314 --> 13:37.649
D.J. Trauma.

13:39.902 --> 13:41.402
All right, all right.

13:41.487 --> 13:44.614
Now we all know each other.
Skipper, I got a question.

13:44.740 --> 13:46.658
What the fuck
are we doing way out here?

13:46.742 --> 13:50.245
Perhaps the good doctor
will be kind enough to tell us.

13:50.579 --> 13:51.955
Thank you.

13:52.748 --> 13:54.833
First of all,
I want to say how much I appreciate

13:54.917 --> 13:57.210
- this opportunity to join you on what I...
- It's for sure

13:57.294 --> 14:00.672
that you appreciate being here, Doctor,
but you must understand that we don't.

14:00.756 --> 14:02.549
We were taken off
a well-deserved leave

14:02.633 --> 14:04.175
and sent into Neptune space.

14:04.260 --> 14:07.762
We are now three billion klicks
from the nearest outpost.

14:08.180 --> 14:11.683
The last time U.S.A.C. Attempted
a rescue this far past the outer reach,

14:11.767 --> 14:15.019
well, we lost both ships.
So, if you please...

14:15.354 --> 14:17.021
Right. Well...

14:18.023 --> 14:21.818
Everything I'm about to tell you
is considered Code Black by the NSA.

14:21.944 --> 14:24.112
U.S.A.C. Intercepted
a radio transmission

14:24.196 --> 14:26.948
from a decaying orbit around Neptune.

14:27.992 --> 14:31.619
The source of this transmission
has been identified

14:31.704 --> 14:33.621
as the Event Horizon.

14:35.958 --> 14:38.042
Yeah, well, that's bullshit, for starters.

14:38.127 --> 14:41.296
- Skipper, you took me off leave...
- Thank you so much.

14:41.380 --> 14:43.172
Smitty, sit down.

14:44.675 --> 14:47.010
Cooper, as you were.

14:48.137 --> 14:49.387
Let the man speak.

14:49.471 --> 14:51.389
What was made public
aboutthe Event Horizon,

14:51.473 --> 14:53.892
that she was a deep space
research vessel,

14:53.976 --> 14:58.062
that her reactor went critical,
and that the ship blew up,

14:58.147 --> 14:59.731
none of that is true.

14:59.815 --> 15:03.234
The Event Horizon was the culmination
of a secret government project

15:03.319 --> 15:06.821
to create a spacecraft
capable of faster-than-light flight.

15:06.906 --> 15:09.991
I don't... Excuse me.
See, you can't actually do that.

15:10.075 --> 15:13.828
The law of relativity
prohibits faster-than-light travel.

15:14.496 --> 15:18.082
Relativity, yes.
We can't break the law of relativity.

15:19.001 --> 15:20.501
We can go around it.

15:20.878 --> 15:22.587
The ship doesn't really go faster
than light.

15:22.671 --> 15:25.673
What it does is
it creates a dimensional gateway

15:25.758 --> 15:27.842
that allows it to jump instantaneously

15:27.927 --> 15:30.345
from one point of the universe
to another light years away.

15:30.429 --> 15:31.679
How?

15:32.097 --> 15:35.892
- Well, it's difficult to... It's all math.
- Try us, Doctor.

15:37.353 --> 15:39.896
Right, well, using layman's terms,

15:40.397 --> 15:42.607
we use a rotating magnetic field

15:42.691 --> 15:46.945
to focus a narrow beam of gravitons.
These in turn fold space-time,

15:47.029 --> 15:49.113
consistent with Weyl tensor dynamics,

15:49.198 --> 15:51.950
until the space-time curvature
becomes infinitely large

15:52.034 --> 15:54.535
and you produce a singularity.
Now, the singularity...

15:54.620 --> 15:56.371
Layman's terms.

15:56.455 --> 15:59.415
Fuck layman's terms.
Do you speak English?

16:03.587 --> 16:06.547
Lmagine, for a minute,
that this piece of paper...

16:06.632 --> 16:10.051
Excuse me.
That's Vanessa, and that's mine.

16:10.135 --> 16:12.929
Attractive piece of paper
represents space-time

16:13.055 --> 16:17.266
and you want to get from
point "A" here

16:17.393 --> 16:19.185
to "B" there.

16:19.269 --> 16:22.355
Now, what's the shortest distance
between two points?

16:22.439 --> 16:23.898
A straight line.

16:24.650 --> 16:25.733
Wrong.

16:25.818 --> 16:28.778
The shortest distance
between two points is zero.

16:28.904 --> 16:30.989
And that's what the gateway does.

16:31.240 --> 16:34.492
It folds space.

16:34.576 --> 16:39.330
So that point "A" and point "B" co-exist
in the same space and time.

16:40.290 --> 16:44.377
When the spacecraft passes
through the gateway,

16:44.461 --> 16:46.504
space returns to normal.

16:46.922 --> 16:49.257
It's called a gravity drive.

16:50.300 --> 16:53.803
- How do you know all this?
- I built it.

16:54.471 --> 16:56.431
Well, I can see why they sent you.

16:56.515 --> 16:59.225
So if the ship didn't blow up,
then what happened?

16:59.309 --> 17:03.354
Well, the mission was going perfectly,
like a textbook.

17:03.439 --> 17:05.940
They reached safe distance
using conventional thrusters.

17:06.025 --> 17:07.900
All systems looked good.

17:07.984 --> 17:09.944
They had the go-ahead to use
the gravity drive

17:10.029 --> 17:12.696
to open the gateway
to Proxima Centauri

17:13.281 --> 17:16.159
and then, they just disappeared.

17:16.367 --> 17:20.079
Vanished without a trace, until now.

17:20.164 --> 17:23.165
Where's she been
for the last seven years, Doctor?

17:23.709 --> 17:26.294
That's what we're here to find out.

17:26.377 --> 17:29.630
Now, we've been unable
to verity life contact,

17:30.632 --> 17:34.343
but TDRS did receive
this single transmission.

17:45.022 --> 17:47.565
- What the fucking hell is that?
- Listen to this.

17:47.649 --> 17:51.152
Houston passed the same recording
through several filters,

17:51.236 --> 17:55.364
managed to isolate what appears to be
a human voice.

18:03.373 --> 18:05.792
I'm not even sure
if it qualifies as language.

18:05.876 --> 18:07.919
- Latin.
- What?

18:08.504 --> 18:11.172
I mean, I think it sounds like Latin.

18:11.256 --> 18:14.008
- Can you translate it?
- Play it again.

18:18.138 --> 18:20.681
Right there. You hear that?

18:23.560 --> 18:27.939
Sounds like, "Liberate me,"
something or other.

18:28.023 --> 18:29.065
I can't make out the rest.

18:29.149 --> 18:30.900
"Liberate me?"

18:31.985 --> 18:33.694
Save me.

18:35.656 --> 18:37.907
All right. Stations, people.

18:51.505 --> 18:55.716
Crossing the Horizon.
Optimum approach angle is 14 degrees.

18:55.801 --> 18:59.303
- Come around to 334.
- Heading 334, sir.

18:59.388 --> 19:02.140
Make your approach vector negative,
14 degrees.

19:02.224 --> 19:03.391
1-4 degrees.

19:07.104 --> 19:10.439
We have lock on Event Horizon's
navigation beacon.

19:11.108 --> 19:12.692
She's in the upper ionosphere

19:12.776 --> 19:15.945
and it looks like we're in
for some very heavy chop, sir.

19:19.658 --> 19:22.618
- Bring us in nice and tight, Mr. Smith.
- Sir.

19:22.703 --> 19:26.539
- Mr. Justin, how's my ship?
- Smooth sailing, sir.

19:26.832 --> 19:28.749
Matching speed on my mark.

19:28.834 --> 19:33.212
Three, two, one. Mark.

19:37.092 --> 19:40.261
- Range?
- 10,000 meters and closing, sir.

19:40.345 --> 19:41.429
- Starck.
- Yes, sir.

19:41.513 --> 19:43.431
Get on the horn.
See if anybody is listening.

19:43.515 --> 19:45.516
This is the US Aerospace
command vessel

19:45.601 --> 19:49.604
Lewis & Ciark hailing Event Horizon.
Event Horizon, do you read?

19:49.688 --> 19:50.980
Dr. Weir.

19:52.441 --> 19:55.610
- I think you'll want to see this.
- Where is she?

19:55.694 --> 19:57.653
Dead ahead. 5,000 meters!

19:57.738 --> 20:00.865
- Starck? Anybody home?
- Event Horizon, do you read?

20:00.949 --> 20:02.992
3,000 meters and closing!

20:07.664 --> 20:08.748
I can't see a thing.

20:08.832 --> 20:11.500
1,500 meters, sir.
We're getting too close.

20:11.585 --> 20:14.712
- Where is it?
- The scope is lit. It's right in front of us.

20:14.796 --> 20:17.381
- 1,000 meters.
- Proximity warning!

20:17.466 --> 20:21.135
900, 800, 700.

20:21.220 --> 20:23.763
- We're right on top of her, sir!
- We're gonna hit.

20:23.847 --> 20:26.641
- Starck!
- It's right there! God!

20:28.602 --> 20:30.645
Reverse thrusters. Full!

20:43.909 --> 20:45.409
There she is.

21:05.722 --> 21:07.014
Jesus.

21:07.891 --> 21:10.226
Very impressive ship, Doctor.

21:10.978 --> 21:14.355
- Thank you.
- Mr. Smith, are you up for a flyby?

21:15.065 --> 21:16.774
Yes, sir. Yes, I'd love to.

21:31.456 --> 21:34.041
That's the main airlock,
we can dock in there.

21:34.126 --> 21:35.960
All right, Smith.

21:36.044 --> 21:39.547
Use the arm and lock us
onto that small antenna cluster.

21:46.972 --> 21:50.766
We should go very carefully here.
That's not a load-bearing structure.

21:52.519 --> 21:54.603
Is now, Doctor.

21:57.441 --> 22:00.693
- Everything five by five?
- Locked in to the Event Horizon.

22:00.777 --> 22:02.903
Thank you, Smitty.
Light them if you got them.

22:02.988 --> 22:05.239
Thank you very much, sir.

22:06.408 --> 22:09.577
- Starck, give me a read.
- The reactor's still hot.

22:09.661 --> 22:11.871
We've got several
small radiation sources,

22:11.955 --> 22:13.998
but no leaks.
Probably it's nothing serious.

22:14.082 --> 22:15.583
- Do they have pressure?
- Affirmative.

22:15.667 --> 22:20.421
The hull's intact, but there's no gravity,
and the thermal units are off-line.

22:20.505 --> 22:22.214
I'm showing deep cold.

22:22.299 --> 22:24.592
The crew couldn't survive
unless they were in stasis.

22:24.676 --> 22:26.969
- Find them, Starck.
- Yeah, I'm already on it, Captain.

22:27.054 --> 22:28.721
Bio-scan on the line.

22:32.017 --> 22:33.351
There's something wrong with the scan.

22:33.435 --> 22:36.562
- Is it radiation interference?
- There's not enough to throw it off.

22:36.646 --> 22:40.524
I'm picking up trace life forms,
but I can't get a lock on their location.

22:40.609 --> 22:43.486
These readings are all over the ship.
It doesn't make any sense.

22:43.570 --> 22:46.989
Okay, we do it the hard way.
Deck by deck, room by room.

22:47.074 --> 22:48.699
Starck, deploy the umbilicus.

22:48.784 --> 22:50.659
Smitty, fire up the boards
in the war room.

22:50.744 --> 22:52.495
Sir.

22:52.579 --> 22:54.705
Mr. Justin,
I believe you're up for a walk?

22:54.790 --> 22:56.165
Yes, sir.

23:00.253 --> 23:02.213
Doctor, I'm gonna need you here
on the bridge.

23:02.297 --> 23:03.631
Captain,

23:03.799 --> 23:06.217
I didn't come out all this way
just to sit on your bridge.

23:06.301 --> 23:08.552
- I need to be on that ship.
- Once we've secured the ship,

23:08.637 --> 23:10.554
- we'll bring you on board.
- No, I'm sorry, that's unacceptable.

23:10.639 --> 23:13.182
- I need to be on that ship.
- Once we've secured the ship.

23:13.266 --> 23:14.433
That's the way it is.

23:14.518 --> 23:16.310
I need you to guide us
from the com station.

23:16.395 --> 23:19.438
This is where I need you.
Help us do our job.

23:32.994 --> 23:35.788
Honey, honey, you forgot your briefoase.

23:47.175 --> 23:48.592
Stand clear.

23:50.846 --> 23:54.140
- Anything gets funky, Cooper...
- I'll be on it.

23:55.851 --> 23:58.936
Yo, Baby Bear, keep your nose clean.

24:06.361 --> 24:08.028
D.J., showtime.

24:10.490 --> 24:12.450
Video feed is clear.

24:12.534 --> 24:16.120
- Are you with us, Dr. Weir?
- Yes, I'm with you.

24:16.872 --> 24:18.622
We are crossing the umbilicus,

24:18.707 --> 24:21.625
making our approach
to the Event Horizon.

24:23.837 --> 24:26.338
You're at the outer airlock door.

24:27.966 --> 24:29.508
Magnetic boots on.

24:35.348 --> 24:37.057
We've got pressure.

24:56.661 --> 24:58.704
Place is a deep freeze.

25:00.999 --> 25:03.417
We got ice crystals everywhere.

25:04.753 --> 25:07.004
That's the central corridor
that you're in now.

25:07.088 --> 25:09.673
It connects the personnel areas
at the front of the ship

25:09.758 --> 25:11.342
to Engineering at the rear.

25:13.595 --> 25:16.263
- Mr. Justin, you take Engineering.
- Yes, sir.

25:16.389 --> 25:19.350
Peters and I'll take the forward decks.

25:29.277 --> 25:31.278
Doctor, what are these?

25:32.239 --> 25:35.699
Yeah, I've got another one over here.
They are all over the place.

25:35.784 --> 25:36.867
In an emergency,

25:36.952 --> 25:40.454
they destroy the central corridor
and split the ship in half

25:41.623 --> 25:44.625
and then the crew can use
the foredecks as a lifeboat.

25:50.257 --> 25:53.884
I'm in Medical. No casualties.

25:57.931 --> 26:00.140
Place looks like it's never been used.

26:00.225 --> 26:01.892
You stiii haven't seen any crew?

26:01.977 --> 26:04.770
If we saw any crew, Doctor,
you'd know it by now.

26:05.981 --> 26:08.148
Scanning for life readings.

26:11.444 --> 26:13.487
This place is a tomb.

26:16.658 --> 26:18.117
Fuck me!

26:18.994 --> 26:20.995
Miiier. Miiier, are you okay?

26:21.413 --> 26:23.747
Looks like Skipper got a case
of the willies.

26:23.832 --> 26:25.916
Cooper, get back to your post.

26:26.167 --> 26:28.419
Miiier, your heart rate
just went through the roof.

26:28.503 --> 26:30.004
I'm fine.

26:36.511 --> 26:40.097
I think I've reached the door
to the first containment, Dr. Weir.

26:40.265 --> 26:42.433
The Engineering decks
are on the other side.

26:42.517 --> 26:44.643
Okay, let's take a look.

27:01.995 --> 27:05.122
What the hell is this place, Dr. Weir?

27:05.206 --> 27:07.291
It aiiows you to enter
the second containment

27:07.375 --> 27:10.044
without compromising
the magnetic fieids.

27:11.713 --> 27:14.214
Looks like a meat grinder to me.

27:18.345 --> 27:20.054
I'm on the bridge.

27:27.854 --> 27:30.064
Got some blood here.

27:43.745 --> 27:48.040
There must have been a coolant leak.
Man, this shit is everywhere.

27:49.959 --> 27:53.796
Coolant level's on reserve,
but well within the safety line.

28:05.433 --> 28:08.143
Miss Peters,
could you turn back and left?

28:09.938 --> 28:12.731
- What is it?
- Ship's log.

28:32.419 --> 28:33.961
It's stuck.

28:35.922 --> 28:38.757
It's pretty jammed in there.

28:47.016 --> 28:49.435
What the hell happened to his eyes?

28:49.519 --> 28:53.355
- Explosive decompression.
- Decompression doesn't do that.

28:55.024 --> 28:58.986
Looks iike it was caused by...
i don't know, an animai or something.

28:59.112 --> 29:02.614
Look at the damage to the soff tissue,
massive abrasions.

29:03.158 --> 29:04.867
Corpse-sicle.

29:07.287 --> 29:09.538
I'm scanning for life forms.

29:14.627 --> 29:18.213
Man, I'm getting some
really strange readings in here.

29:30.185 --> 29:33.020
Let me see if I can get some power up.

29:43.907 --> 29:45.866
That's the core, the gravity drive.

29:52.081 --> 29:54.041
The heart of the ship.

30:09.891 --> 30:13.227
Justin. Justin, you're breaking up.

30:24.030 --> 30:25.739
Justin, come in.

30:37.293 --> 30:38.502
- What is it?
- I don't know.

30:38.586 --> 30:40.504
The life scan just went off the scale.

30:51.641 --> 30:53.976
Something's wrong, Starck.
Pull him out. Pull him out.

30:59.983 --> 31:01.358
Shit!

31:05.780 --> 31:06.864
He's in trouble.

31:06.948 --> 31:09.116
- Go, Coop.
- I'm gone.

31:47.864 --> 31:50.157
Boarding party, sound off.

31:50.575 --> 31:53.243
This is Miller. Can anybody hear me?

31:59.584 --> 32:02.711
- What the fuck was that?
- Pressure emergency!

32:02.837 --> 32:06.089
We've lost the starboard baffle.
The hull's been breached!

32:07.050 --> 32:09.801
I'll contain it here for as long as I can!
Get out!

32:09.886 --> 32:11.929
We're losing atmosphere.

32:13.514 --> 32:16.308
There are pressure suits in the airlock.
Go!

32:16.392 --> 32:18.143
Here I come. Here I come.

32:22.523 --> 32:24.358
Hold on, Baby Bear.

32:24.692 --> 32:26.735
I'm almost there, almost there.

32:31.532 --> 32:33.408
I got you. I got...

32:34.243 --> 32:36.119
Watch out. Watch...

32:37.413 --> 32:40.248
I got you. What the fuck is this?

32:40.875 --> 32:42.125
Hold on.

32:44.879 --> 32:47.881
Captain Miller.
Captain Miller, do you copy? Over.

32:48.216 --> 32:51.969
- Smitty, where you been all my life?
- We have a major situation here, sir.

32:52.053 --> 32:55.472
We've lost the starboard baffle,
and the hull's been breached.

32:55.640 --> 32:58.266
The safety circuits, they have failed.

32:58.393 --> 33:00.185
- Do we have time for a weld?
- No, sir.

33:00.269 --> 33:04.356
We've got 218 liters of gas left, sir,
and then we've got nothing.

33:04.440 --> 33:06.984
The oxygen tanks, they failed,
they're broken.

33:07.068 --> 33:10.320
- Sir, we are fucking dead!
- What about the Event Horizon?

33:10.822 --> 33:12.072
What?

33:12.156 --> 33:14.992
- She's got air and power.
- It's our only chance.

33:15.076 --> 33:17.202
There's no way
I'm getting on that bastard.

33:17.286 --> 33:18.996
We don't even know
what happened on that ship.

33:19.080 --> 33:20.914
It beats dying, Mr. Smith.

33:21.290 --> 33:25.085
I want all personnel on board
the Event Horizon, pronto.

33:25.586 --> 33:28.171
- We'll meet at the air tanks.
- I'm ahead of you, sir.

33:28.256 --> 33:31.133
Bringing all thermal units online.

33:31.259 --> 33:34.136
Hold tight. Prep for G's.

33:34.429 --> 33:36.513
Gravity in five seconds.

33:51.612 --> 33:54.823
Wake up, open your eyes. All right?
Just hang in there.

34:18.973 --> 34:20.348
Dr. Weir.

34:21.893 --> 34:23.185
Well,

34:23.770 --> 34:26.146
I brought most primary systems online,

34:26.856 --> 34:28.106
- for now.
- Thank you.

34:28.190 --> 34:31.985
- Starck, what's our status?
- The antenna array is completely fried.

34:32.070 --> 34:35.280
We've got no radio,
no laser, no high gain.

34:35.364 --> 34:37.199
No one's coming to help us.

34:37.742 --> 34:40.284
- This air tastes bad.
- Yeah, carbon dioxide, I know.

34:40.369 --> 34:42.661
It's building up
with every breath we take.

34:42.746 --> 34:45.290
And the CO2 filters
on the Event Horizon are shot.

34:45.373 --> 34:46.917
So, we take the scrubbers
from the Clark.

34:47.001 --> 34:50.003
- That gives us what?
- Enough breathable air for 20 hours,

34:50.088 --> 34:52.255
but after that,
we'd better be on our way home.

35:08.606 --> 35:12.275
I'm on the port side of the hull,
approaching the dorsal heat sink.

35:16.322 --> 35:17.697
Holy shit.

35:23.788 --> 35:26.248
Captain Miller. Captain Miller,
do you copy? Over.

35:26.332 --> 35:28.708
I copy, Mr. Smith. How's my ship?

35:28.793 --> 35:31.670
Sir, we've got a 7-meter fracture
on the outer hull.

35:31.754 --> 35:35.048
We shouid be abie to repair her,
but it'ii take an awfui iot of time, sir.

35:35.133 --> 35:37.717
Negative. 20 hours, we run out of air.

35:37.802 --> 35:39.136
Understood, sir.

35:41.764 --> 35:43.598
What happened here, Doctor?

35:55.069 --> 35:57.487
Okay, how is he?

35:58.072 --> 36:02.117
His vital signs seem stable,
but he's unresponsive to stimuli.

36:02.785 --> 36:04.035
I don't know.

36:08.624 --> 36:10.584
He might wake up in 15 minutes.

36:12.587 --> 36:14.421
He might not wake up at all.

36:15.214 --> 36:17.257
Look, Skipper,
I know this shit sounds weird,

36:17.341 --> 36:21.803
but, I mean, there was like nothing,
and then Justin appeared,

36:21.888 --> 36:26.516
and it was liquid,
and the whole core just turned solid.

36:26.601 --> 36:28.268
It's just not physically possible.

36:28.352 --> 36:31.271
Doctor, please. Please,
don't start in with that physics shit.

36:31.355 --> 36:33.356
I'm telling you, I saw it.

36:33.441 --> 36:35.942
Mr. Cooper,
it would mean the gateway was open.

36:36.027 --> 36:39.821
- That's it. The gateway was open.
- The gateway couldn't be open

36:39.906 --> 36:42.324
because the gravity drive
wasn't activated.

36:42.408 --> 36:44.201
Look, I'm telling you what I saw, Doc!
So...

36:44.285 --> 36:48.622
- It can't just start up by itself.
- Mr. Cooper, you are out of line.

36:49.749 --> 36:52.918
Doctor, Mr. Justin may die.
Now, I have to assume

36:53.002 --> 36:56.379
that whatever happened to him
could happen to all of us.

36:56.464 --> 37:01.176
Mr. Cooper says he saw something.
I believe he saw something.

37:02.053 --> 37:04.304
I need an explanation.

37:07.850 --> 37:12.020
In my view, Mr. Cooper's delusional,
if you don't mind my saying so.

37:12.104 --> 37:15.440
But maybe he saw an optical effect

37:15.524 --> 37:17.359
caused by gravitational distortion.

37:17.443 --> 37:19.527
"An optical effect"?
That's fucking poetic.

37:19.612 --> 37:21.488
- Where the fuck...
- Cooper!

37:21.572 --> 37:23.698
I'm sorry. All right.

37:25.826 --> 37:28.954
Gravitational distortion.
What could create that, Doctor?

37:29.038 --> 37:33.458
If, somehow, a burst of gravity waves
escaped from the core,

37:34.585 --> 37:38.463
it could distort space-time.
It could make Justin seem to disappear.

37:38.547 --> 37:42.008
It could also
have damaged the Lewis & Clark.

37:43.010 --> 37:47.639
- However, I think this is entirely unlikely.
- What's in the core, Doctor?

37:48.724 --> 37:49.891
It's complicated.

37:49.976 --> 37:52.727
How much time do you need?
We have,

37:52.812 --> 37:55.313
17 hours and 48 minutes.

37:56.565 --> 37:58.358
What's in the core?

38:00.319 --> 38:02.821
This is the gateway.

38:02.905 --> 38:05.782
Now, these three magnetic rings,
when they align,

38:05.866 --> 38:08.118
it creates an artificial black hole

38:08.202 --> 38:10.912
which allows the ship to travel
to any point in space.

38:10.997 --> 38:14.791
A black hole, the most destructive force
in the universe.

38:15.209 --> 38:17.752
- And you've created one?
- Absolutely, yes.

38:17.837 --> 38:22.924
Because we can use that
immense power to bend space-time.

38:23.009 --> 38:26.594
Look, it would take the Lewis & Clark
1,000 years

38:26.679 --> 38:28.930
to reach our nearest star.

38:29.015 --> 38:31.474
Butthe Event Horizon
could be there in a day.

38:31.559 --> 38:34.728
- If it worked.
- You can come down. It's perfectly safe.

38:40.443 --> 38:43.403
So, if Mr. Justin was sucked
through your gateway,

38:43.487 --> 38:45.989
he could've gone wherever
the Event Horizon's been.

38:46.073 --> 38:48.533
Theoretically, yes.
But as I told you before,

38:48.617 --> 38:52.495
- the gateway can't just open by itself.
- I see.

38:52.580 --> 38:54.289
Lieutenant, I want this room sealed off.

38:54.373 --> 38:56.249
Second containment from here on in
is off-limits.

38:56.334 --> 38:58.960
- Yes, sir.
- Captain, there's no danger.

38:59.045 --> 39:01.087
The gateway's
contained behind three magnetic fields.

39:01.172 --> 39:03.757
- It's perfectly safe.
- Safe?

39:03.841 --> 39:05.216
Doctor, my ship is in pieces

39:05.301 --> 39:08.011
and one of my crewmen
may not make it home alive.

39:08.095 --> 39:10.597
No one else goes near this thing.

39:31.160 --> 39:32.452
Come on.

39:34.538 --> 39:37.457
There's got to be something on this log.

39:38.542 --> 39:40.210
You can do this.

39:44.131 --> 39:45.340
D.J.?

40:05.528 --> 40:09.030
- D.J., where are you?
- I'm up on Deck 4.

41:02.835 --> 41:04.043
Mommy.

41:16.891 --> 41:18.141
Peters!

41:24.565 --> 41:26.733
What is it? You all right?

41:43.751 --> 41:46.002
What's up? You was out there so long,

41:46.086 --> 41:47.837
I thought you were
trying to break my record.

41:47.922 --> 41:51.174
Listen, I'd rather spend the next
12 hours outside

41:51.258 --> 41:53.635
than another five seconds
in this shit can.

41:53.719 --> 41:56.095
It's the final entry in the ship's log.

41:56.597 --> 41:59.432
I want to say how proud i am
of my crew.

41:59.558 --> 42:01.684
I'd iike to name my station heads:

42:01.769 --> 42:03.853
Chris Chambers, Janice Reuben,

42:04.563 --> 42:07.023
Ben Fender, Dick Smith.

42:09.235 --> 42:10.652
We've reached safe distance...

42:10.736 --> 42:12.445
This is John Kilpack, ship's captain.

42:12.530 --> 42:15.949
...and we're preparing to engage
the gravity drive,

42:16.075 --> 42:18.952
and open the gateway
to Proxima Centauri.

42:22.623 --> 42:24.040
Haii and fareweii.

42:32.550 --> 42:34.717
- What is that?
- I'll run it through a few filters,

42:34.802 --> 42:36.928
see if I can clean it up.

42:40.933 --> 42:43.476
- It's a power drain.
- It's the core.

42:44.979 --> 42:46.729
Stay here. Look after Justin.

42:46.814 --> 42:48.648
I don't want anybody else
near that thing.

42:48.732 --> 42:49.941
Wait for me, Doctor.

42:51.652 --> 42:55.405
- What's causing the drain?
- Magnetic fields are holding.

42:55.489 --> 42:58.741
Maybe a short in the fail-safe circuit.
I'll check it.

42:58.826 --> 43:00.410
Can you give us a hand?

43:21.348 --> 43:22.640
Justin.

43:23.017 --> 43:24.684
Justin, can you hear me?

43:25.644 --> 43:27.812
- He's coming.
- Who's coming?

43:29.857 --> 43:31.649
The dark.

43:48.667 --> 43:50.877
Yeah, that's the one.

44:04.183 --> 44:34.921
Biiiy.

44:45.391 --> 44:46.641
Miller!

44:47.601 --> 44:49.435
Captain Miller!

44:49.561 --> 44:51.771
I've got some problems here.

44:56.944 --> 44:58.444
Be with me,

44:59.446 --> 45:00.738
forever.

45:09.164 --> 45:10.498
Dr. Weir?

45:37.317 --> 45:40.236
Carbon dioxide can produce
hallucinations, impair judgment.

45:40.320 --> 45:42.405
God damn it, D.J.,
it was not a hallucination.

45:42.489 --> 45:43.865
All right.

45:44.032 --> 45:46.325
Doctor, you were in the duct.

45:46.535 --> 45:48.953
You must have heard something.

45:50.164 --> 45:52.832
- You must have seen something.
- I did.

45:53.000 --> 45:55.585
About an hour ago, I saw my son

45:55.669 --> 45:58.212
lying on the examination table

46:01.467 --> 46:02.967
- and in his legs were...
- Miss Peters...

46:03.051 --> 46:04.886
...crawling...
...if you don't mind my saying so,

46:04.970 --> 46:06.220
it sounds a little like shock.

46:06.305 --> 46:08.139
- Could it be that you're traumatized...
- No. No.

46:08.223 --> 46:10.892
...by seeing the body on the...
- Excuse me. No!

46:12.519 --> 46:15.104
I've seen bodies before.
This was different.

46:15.189 --> 46:17.106
She's right. Now, this was real.

46:17.191 --> 46:19.859
I felt... I felt heat.

46:19.985 --> 46:22.862
This is not something
that's in our heads.

46:24.698 --> 46:27.992
Smitty, have you seen anything unusual
at all?

46:28.535 --> 46:31.078
No, I haven't seen anything,
and I don't need to see anything, sir,

46:31.163 --> 46:33.331
but I can tell you

46:33.415 --> 46:35.374
this ship is fucked.

46:35.501 --> 46:38.127
Thank you for that scientific analysis,
Mr. Smith.

46:38.212 --> 46:40.296
Well, you don't expect
to figure it out, do you?

46:40.380 --> 46:41.339
All right, Doc.

46:41.423 --> 46:42.632
When you break
all the laws of physics,

46:42.716 --> 46:44.133
you seriously think
there won't be a price?

46:44.218 --> 46:47.470
You already killed the last fucking crew.
And now you want to kill us as well!

46:47.554 --> 46:50.014
- It's just a fucking ship, all right?
- D.J.!

46:50.098 --> 46:53.184
It's just a ship, do you understand?
It's just a big hunk of metal.

46:53.268 --> 46:56.062
- There's nothing odd going on.
- D.J.?

47:00.067 --> 47:02.193
- Fine.
- D.J.?

47:05.614 --> 47:08.032
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm just...

47:08.742 --> 47:10.076
I'm sorry.

47:10.244 --> 47:11.786
- Damn it!
- Smitty.

47:11.912 --> 47:13.996
- It's all right. That's it.
- Fucking...

47:14.081 --> 47:17.583
That's enough! I want you calm,
I want you cool! Now!

47:19.419 --> 47:22.171
- All right.
- You're going back upstairs.

47:22.256 --> 47:24.382
You're going outside on the Clark
with Cooper,

47:24.466 --> 47:26.884
and you're going to repair the ship.
No mistakes.

47:26.969 --> 47:29.762
Mistakes, nobody goes home.
Understood?

47:30.597 --> 47:32.473
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

47:33.141 --> 47:34.892
- Sir.
- Get moving.

47:41.984 --> 47:43.693
- Miller.
- What is it, Starck?

47:43.777 --> 47:46.487
I ran the bio-scan
with the DNA-RNA filters.

47:46.613 --> 47:47.822
The results were bio readings...

47:47.906 --> 47:49.532
Of an indeterminate origin. Yes, I know.

47:49.616 --> 47:52.368
Don't you have anything useful
to tell me, Lieutenant?

47:52.452 --> 47:55.246
- I've got a theory.
- Let's hear it.

47:55.330 --> 47:58.833
I think that there's a connection between
the readings and the hallucinations,

47:58.917 --> 48:01.252
like they're all part
of a defensive reaction,

48:01.336 --> 48:02.587
some sort of immune system.

48:02.671 --> 48:04.255
I don't have time to listen to this.

48:04.339 --> 48:05.798
- You have to listen to me.
- To what?

48:05.883 --> 48:09.385
I'm saying that this ship is reacting to us
and the reactions are getting stronger.

48:09.469 --> 48:11.345
It's as if the ship
brought back something with it,

48:11.430 --> 48:13.014
a life force of some kind.

48:13.098 --> 48:15.725
What are you telling me?
That this ship is alive?

48:15.809 --> 48:18.519
You wanted an answer,
and it's the only one I've got.

48:18.604 --> 48:22.106
No, what I want, Lieutenant,
is to survive the next 10 hours.

49:06.985 --> 49:08.235
Justin?

49:09.571 --> 49:15.701
Justin!

50:06.920 --> 50:09.130
Did you hear that? Did you hear that?

50:09.214 --> 50:10.506
- What's that?
- What is it?

50:10.590 --> 50:12.008
- You heard it.
- What did you hear?

50:12.092 --> 50:13.509
- What is it?
- Peters, listen to me.

50:13.593 --> 50:14.885
It's D.J., all right?

50:14.970 --> 50:16.971
I didn't hear anything.
Neither of us heard anything.

50:17.055 --> 50:18.347
- So just calm down, all right?
- Okay.

50:18.432 --> 50:20.433
- Get your breath back.
- Okay.

50:20.559 --> 50:22.643
- Now, tell me.
- I was...

50:27.065 --> 50:29.817
Make it stop! Make it stop!

50:31.236 --> 50:32.778
Open the door.

50:34.239 --> 50:35.740
Stop moving!

50:38.618 --> 50:41.495
- No!
- Weir, stop. Stop him!

50:41.621 --> 50:43.456
What're you doing?

50:46.460 --> 50:50.629
In our current environment, Dr. Weir,
self-control is an asset.

50:56.845 --> 50:58.304
What is it?

50:59.181 --> 51:01.015
The forward airlock.

51:01.308 --> 51:04.101
Miller, Smith, Cooper,
anyone in the airlock?

51:04.186 --> 51:05.978
That's a negative, Starck.

51:06.646 --> 51:07.855
Justin.

51:10.650 --> 51:12.318
- Justin.
- Don't!

51:12.444 --> 51:13.986
Justin, no!

51:14.112 --> 51:16.947
Justin, no! Justin, open the door.

51:18.450 --> 51:19.867
Miller, come in.

51:19.993 --> 51:22.828
Miiier, come in. We have an emergency.

51:22.954 --> 51:24.789
What's going on in there, Starck?

51:24.873 --> 51:27.416
- Justin's in the airlock.
- Say again.

51:27.501 --> 51:30.377
Justin is in the airlock
and he is not wearing a suit.

51:30.462 --> 51:32.838
- Shit. I'm on it.
- As you were, sailor.

51:32.964 --> 51:35.466
- Skipper, you need me on this.
- I need you right where you are.

51:35.550 --> 51:37.384
He's engaged the override.

51:37.511 --> 51:39.512
- Can you shut it down?
- I'll try.

51:40.013 --> 51:41.263
Coming to him, Starck.

51:41.348 --> 51:44.225
Justin! Open this door, now!

51:47.979 --> 51:49.313
Starck, give me status.

51:49.397 --> 51:51.315
You better hurry.
He's engaged the override

51:51.399 --> 51:53.609
- and we can't open the inner door.
- I'll get the kit.

51:53.693 --> 51:56.487
Justin, open the door!

52:00.867 --> 52:04.036
Justin, open the door.

52:04.162 --> 52:06.455
- Did you hear it?
- Keep him talking.

52:06.540 --> 52:09.959
Yes. Yes, I heard it.
Do you know what it is?

52:10.043 --> 52:12.044
It shows you things,

52:12.170 --> 52:15.381
- horrible things.
- What does?

52:15.465 --> 52:19.718
The dark inside me
from the other place.

52:19.803 --> 52:22.972
- I won't go back there. I won't.
- No, Baby Bear.

52:23.056 --> 52:24.807
- Come on, open the door.
- What's happening?

52:24.891 --> 52:27.143
- I don't think she can talk him down.
- She'd better.

52:27.227 --> 52:29.436
If he opens the airlock,
he's going to turn inside out.

52:29.521 --> 52:31.981
- No. You stay with me.
- Almost got it.

52:32.065 --> 52:34.441
- I've almost got it.
- You stay with me, Justin.

52:34.526 --> 52:36.152
Come on, now. Open that door!

52:36.236 --> 52:39.655
If you could see the things I've seen,
you wouldn't try to stop me.

52:39.739 --> 52:41.949
No, that's not you talking.
That's not you talking.

52:42.033 --> 52:44.076
That's it. That's it, right there.

52:44.161 --> 52:46.829
Open the door. Go for that button.
Come on.

52:46.913 --> 52:48.080
Okay.

52:50.083 --> 52:51.083
No!

52:53.420 --> 52:56.922
Captain, Justin just activated the door.
It's on a 30-second delay.

52:57.007 --> 52:59.091
Justin!

53:02.721 --> 53:06.432
Stand by for decompression
in 25 seconds.

53:07.434 --> 53:09.351
Where am I?

53:09.895 --> 53:11.604
- Hey.
- Starck, get it fucking open!

53:11.688 --> 53:12.938
- Hey, open the door.
- I can't.

53:13.023 --> 53:15.524
The inner door won't open
when the outside door's been triggered.

53:15.609 --> 53:17.693
- It'd decompress the entire ship.
- Oh, my God.

53:17.777 --> 53:20.613
Mama Bear, open the door.

53:20.739 --> 53:22.406
Come on, please.

53:23.033 --> 53:25.367
- Captain!
- Patch me through to him.

53:25.452 --> 53:27.203
Captain Miller, tell them
to open the door.

53:27.287 --> 53:29.121
They can't do that, Justin.

53:29.206 --> 53:32.041
- I don't want to die in here.
- You're not gonna die.

53:32.125 --> 53:36.337
I want you to listen to me very carefully,
and I'm gonna get you out of there.

53:39.466 --> 53:40.925
Oh, my God.

53:41.259 --> 53:42.801
It's starting.

53:43.220 --> 53:45.721
- My eyes.
- Don't think about them. Shut them.

53:45.805 --> 53:47.973
Just shut them as tight as you can.

53:48.099 --> 53:49.183
Five seconds.

53:49.267 --> 53:52.561
Tuck yourself into a crouch position.
Make yourself into a ball now.

53:52.646 --> 53:55.731
I can't breathe. Ch, God.

53:55.982 --> 53:58.234
Oh, God, it hurts.

53:58.318 --> 54:02.571
I want you to huff and puff
and blow all the air out of your lungs.

54:02.656 --> 54:05.658
Do you hear me?
All the air out of your lungs, Justin.

54:07.327 --> 54:08.994
Do it, now!

54:21.007 --> 54:22.675
Okay, Baby Bear.

54:24.511 --> 54:28.514
Got him. I got him. Stand by, people.

54:28.598 --> 54:29.932
Standby.

54:31.977 --> 54:35.437
- We've got pressure.
- We're coming, Justin. We're coming.

54:37.107 --> 54:40.651
I'm going to need five units here.
Hold his head still.

54:41.444 --> 54:42.653
Okay.

54:44.698 --> 54:47.032
Give me some more glycerin, now.

54:47.117 --> 54:48.701
One thing at a time,
iet's keep him breathing.

54:48.785 --> 54:49.910
Christ, he's bieeding out.

54:49.995 --> 54:52.871
- Pressure's stiii dropping.
- Start the drip, 15 cc.

55:01.298 --> 55:04.800
I've stopped the bleeding,
stabilized him best I can.

55:06.219 --> 55:09.138
He won't be pretty, but he should live

55:09.472 --> 55:12.057
- if we make it back.
- We'll make it.

55:13.643 --> 55:15.894
Starck, what's our time like?

55:15.979 --> 55:18.897
CO2 levels will become toxic
in four hours.

55:19.649 --> 55:20.899
All right.

55:20.984 --> 55:23.736
Peters, we've got to find out
what happened to the other crew

55:23.820 --> 55:26.488
before the same thing happens to us.

55:26.573 --> 55:30.826
I can work on the log on the bridge,
but I won't go back to Medical.

55:30.910 --> 55:33.579
- Fine.
- Yes, sir.

55:35.832 --> 55:38.208
Justin said something about,

55:39.419 --> 55:41.337
"the dark inside me."

55:42.505 --> 55:44.256
What's that mean?

55:45.050 --> 55:46.342
Doctor?

55:48.511 --> 55:50.929
I don't think it means anything.

55:55.268 --> 55:57.895
Don't you walk away from me, mister.

55:59.522 --> 56:01.357
I'd like some answers, Doctor.

56:01.441 --> 56:04.026
I'd like to know why one of my men
tried to commit suicide

56:04.110 --> 56:08.280
by throwing himself out of an airlock.
I'd like to know what caused that noise.

56:08.365 --> 56:09.990
Look, thermal changes in the hull

56:10.075 --> 56:13.369
could've caused the metal
to expand and contract rapidly,

56:13.453 --> 56:14.995
causing reverberations.
This is possible.

56:15.080 --> 56:19.124
Bullshit! You built this fucking ship.
You've given me nothing but bullshit.

56:19.250 --> 56:21.460
What do you want me to say?

56:21.711 --> 56:25.547
You said the ship's drive
creates a gateway.

56:25.632 --> 56:27.299
- Yeah.
- To what?

56:28.760 --> 56:30.511
- I don't know.
- Where did it go?

56:30.595 --> 56:33.555
- Where did you send it?
- I don't know.

56:33.640 --> 56:36.058
Where has it been
for the last seven years?

56:36.142 --> 56:37.226
Look, I don't know.

56:37.310 --> 56:39.395
"I don't know,"
is not good enough, Doctor.

56:39.479 --> 56:41.355
You're supposed to be
the fucking expert.

56:41.439 --> 56:43.565
I need answers. That's your job.

56:43.650 --> 56:47.486
- Now, the other place, where is that?
- I don't know! I don't know!

56:48.321 --> 56:49.405
Look,

56:50.156 --> 56:52.199
there's a lot of things
happening around here

56:52.283 --> 56:55.744
that I don't fully understand. I need time.

56:57.122 --> 56:58.330
I see.

56:58.915 --> 57:02.167
Well, that's exactly
what we don't have, Doctor.

57:07.340 --> 57:08.674
Captain!

57:14.931 --> 57:24.606
Don't ieave me!

57:30.029 --> 57:31.321
Piease!

57:34.617 --> 57:38.495
For God's sakes, heip me!

57:48.548 --> 57:50.299
It's in your head.

57:52.886 --> 57:54.887
It's just in your head.

58:14.741 --> 58:16.200
God help us.

58:21.998 --> 58:24.333
I'm telling you, it was his voice I heard.

58:24.417 --> 58:28.253
He was calling to me.
A young bosun named Eddie Corrick.

58:30.089 --> 58:32.674
We served on the Goliath together.

58:34.010 --> 58:38.180
When the O2 tanks ruptured,
four of us made it to the lifeboat.

58:38.264 --> 58:42.684
But Corrick was still on board
the Goliath when the fire broke out.

58:43.019 --> 58:45.604
You ever seen fire in zero gravity?

58:47.524 --> 58:49.107
It's beautiful.

58:51.277 --> 58:53.028
It's like liquid.

58:54.113 --> 58:56.448
It slides all over everything.

58:57.617 --> 58:59.368
Comes up in waves.

59:00.912 --> 59:03.413
And they just kept hitting him,

59:03.790 --> 59:05.457
wave after wave.

59:07.710 --> 59:10.295
He was screaming for me to save him.

59:11.297 --> 59:12.965
What did you do?

59:13.466 --> 59:15.801
I did the only thing I could.

59:17.804 --> 59:21.223
I closed the lifeboat hatch,
and I left him behind.

59:25.270 --> 59:27.813
I swore I'd never lose another man.

59:29.107 --> 59:31.275
I've known you a long time.

59:31.818 --> 59:36.154
- You never told me that.
- That's just it, D.J., I never told anybody.

59:37.574 --> 59:39.825
But this ship knew about it.

59:40.660 --> 59:44.246
It knows my fears. It knows my secrets.

59:45.498 --> 59:48.292
Gets inside your head,
and it shows you.

59:49.752 --> 59:52.170
I wasn't going to tell you this.

59:54.132 --> 59:57.175
I've been listening to the distress signal.

59:57.343 --> 59:58.844
And I...

01:00:00.930 --> 01:00:03.932
I think I made a mistake
in the translation.

01:00:12.692 --> 01:00:13.942
Go on.

01:00:15.194 --> 01:00:17.529
I thought it said "liberate me."

01:00:18.323 --> 01:00:19.615
Save me.

01:00:20.992 --> 01:00:22.659
But it's not "me."

01:00:23.786 --> 01:00:26.204
It's "iiberate tutume."

01:00:27.290 --> 01:00:28.832
Save yourself.

01:00:29.709 --> 01:00:31.460
And it gets worse.

01:00:35.173 --> 01:00:36.381
There.

01:00:37.675 --> 01:00:39.051
I think,

01:00:39.844 --> 01:00:42.971
that says "ex inferis."

01:00:44.474 --> 01:00:46.141
"Save yourself,

01:00:48.561 --> 01:00:49.895
"from hell."

01:00:51.522 --> 01:00:54.900
Look, if what Dr. Weir tells us is true,

01:00:56.402 --> 01:01:00.238
this ship has been beyond
the boundaries of our universe

01:01:00.365 --> 01:01:02.574
of known scientific reality.

01:01:03.993 --> 01:01:06.244
Who knows where it's been,

01:01:06.704 --> 01:01:08.413
what it's seen,

01:01:10.333 --> 01:01:12.918
and what it's brought back with it.

01:01:13.252 --> 01:01:14.628
From hell.

01:01:18.841 --> 01:01:22.094
You don't believe in that kind of stuff,
do you?

01:01:24.847 --> 01:01:28.308
Whoever sent that message,
he sure believes in hell.

01:01:29.268 --> 01:01:30.852
Captain Miiier.

01:01:35.024 --> 01:01:37.067
Whatever it is, Coop, it better be good.

01:01:37.151 --> 01:01:38.235
Yes, sir.

01:01:38.319 --> 01:01:41.071
Ready to repressurize the Clark
and get the heii out of here.

01:01:41.155 --> 01:01:42.572
On my way.

01:01:47.328 --> 01:01:49.454
Come on, baby, don't let me down.

01:01:57.255 --> 01:02:00.215
Hello, baby. Papa's home.

01:02:00.842 --> 01:02:02.384
She's holding.

01:02:03.636 --> 01:02:04.845
Oh, shit.

01:02:04.929 --> 01:02:07.848
Skipper, we're still venting
trace gasses.

01:02:07.932 --> 01:02:10.016
Give me about 20 minutes
to plug the hole.

01:02:10.101 --> 01:02:14.855
Cooper, you are the iifesaver.
20 minutes and we're underway.

01:02:18.568 --> 01:02:19.735
Shit.

01:02:23.114 --> 01:02:26.783
- Got any coffee?
- Yeah, but it's cold.

01:02:26.868 --> 01:02:28.118
Great.

01:02:38.463 --> 01:02:39.671
Starck.

01:02:45.219 --> 01:02:46.261
Miller?

01:03:07.241 --> 01:03:08.533
We're leaving.

01:03:11.579 --> 01:03:13.455
No, we can't leave.

01:03:14.832 --> 01:03:16.541
Our orders are specific.

01:03:16.626 --> 01:03:19.503
Rescue the crew,
salvage what's left of the ship.

01:03:19.587 --> 01:03:22.547
The crew is dead, Doctor.
Your ship killed them.

01:03:22.632 --> 01:03:25.842
- We came here to do a job.
- We're aborting, Doctor!

01:03:26.552 --> 01:03:29.805
Starck, download the files
from the Event Horizon's computers.

01:03:29.889 --> 01:03:32.098
D.J., I want you to get Justin prepped

01:03:32.183 --> 01:03:33.475
and ready to move him back
to the Clark.

01:03:33.559 --> 01:03:36.019
There's stuff I wanna get from medical.
We'd better move him in the tank.

01:03:36.103 --> 01:03:37.771
No problem. Do it.

01:03:39.690 --> 01:03:40.899
- Peters.
- Yes, sir.

01:03:40.983 --> 01:03:43.109
I want you to get the CO2 scrubbers
back into the Clark.

01:03:43.194 --> 01:03:45.320
- Take Smitty with you.
- Right.

01:03:45.404 --> 01:03:49.825
Captain.

01:03:51.994 --> 01:03:55.288
- Don't do this.
- It's done.

01:03:56.916 --> 01:03:58.959
What about my ship?
You can't just leave her.

01:03:59.043 --> 01:04:00.710
I have no intention of leaving her,
Doctor.

01:04:00.795 --> 01:04:02.796
I will take the Lewis & Clark
to a safe distance,

01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:05.423
and then I will launch tac missiles
atthe Event Horizon,

01:04:05.508 --> 01:04:09.094
until I'm satisfied she's vaporized.
Fuck this ship.

01:04:16.853 --> 01:04:20.230
Captain Miller,
the bio-scan just went off the scale.

01:04:20.314 --> 01:04:21.690
It looks like the core

01:04:21.774 --> 01:04:24.192
is draining power
from the rest of the ship.

01:04:24.277 --> 01:04:27.153
Get the files. Vacate.
I want off this ship.

01:04:27.238 --> 01:04:30.699
You can't leave. She won't let you.

01:04:30.783 --> 01:04:33.410
You just get your gear and get back
on the Lewis & Clark Doctor,

01:04:33.494 --> 01:04:35.579
or you'll find yourself walking home.

01:04:35.663 --> 01:04:37.539
I am home.

01:04:38.207 --> 01:04:39.457
Let's go!

01:04:40.001 --> 01:04:41.209
Ready?

01:04:42.169 --> 01:04:43.753
Shot.

01:04:44.881 --> 01:04:46.172
Come on.

01:04:47.258 --> 01:04:48.800
- Ready?
- Shot.

01:04:54.056 --> 01:04:55.682
- Shot.
- Okay.

01:04:56.183 --> 01:04:58.393
Peters, can we go?
This place is really freaking me out.

01:04:58.477 --> 01:05:00.103
Yeah, you wanna breathe
on the way home.

01:05:00.187 --> 01:05:02.397
- No, I don't! Let's go!
- Shit!

01:05:02.940 --> 01:05:04.316
- 25.
- Come on!

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:06.401
- We need 25.
- Peters!

01:05:06.485 --> 01:05:08.612
Come on! Got it!

01:07:33.424 --> 01:07:35.341
Oh, no. Peters.

01:07:41.432 --> 01:07:43.058
Oh, God.

01:07:48.981 --> 01:07:50.023
Biiiy.

01:08:00.159 --> 01:08:01.409
Claire?

01:08:08.918 --> 01:08:09.959
Claire.

01:08:11.629 --> 01:08:13.296
It's me. I'm home.

01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:17.341
I'm home.

01:08:21.263 --> 01:08:24.265
I know I wasn't there
when you needed me,

01:08:25.309 --> 01:08:27.185
and I'm sorry I...

01:08:27.895 --> 01:08:31.064
I let my work come between us.

01:08:35.111 --> 01:08:37.278
God, Claire, no.

01:08:38.113 --> 01:08:41.783
I'm begging you, please. Please, don't.

01:08:41.867 --> 01:08:43.868
Not again, please.

01:08:44.662 --> 01:08:53.586
I've been so...

01:08:55.421 --> 01:08:57.423
Billy.

01:08:58.091 --> 01:08:59.759
It's all right.

01:09:02.595 --> 01:09:06.307
- I've been so alone.
- You'll never be alone again.

01:09:07.768 --> 01:09:11.479
You're with me now. You're with me

01:09:12.439 --> 01:09:16.359
and I have such wonderful,
wonderful things

01:09:17.528 --> 01:09:18.987
to show you.

01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:39.883
Damn, I'm good.

01:09:42.678 --> 01:09:45.930
Coop.
Coop, how long are you going to take?

01:09:46.098 --> 01:09:47.640
'Cause i've got to get
the heii out of here.

01:09:47.725 --> 01:09:50.393
Look, you can kiss my ass, Smith,
'cause I'm done.

01:09:50.477 --> 01:09:52.729
Just give me a second
to collect my tools

01:09:52.813 --> 01:09:54.147
and we can get out of Dodge.

01:09:54.231 --> 01:09:56.399
- Two minutes tops.
- Roger that.

01:10:02.489 --> 01:10:03.531
Weir.

01:10:04.074 --> 01:10:05.408
Dr. Weir.

01:10:05.993 --> 01:10:11.581
Weir!

01:10:13.667 --> 01:10:15.752
Dr. Weir,
get your ass back on board now!

01:10:15.836 --> 01:10:17.462
Weir!

01:10:18.339 --> 01:10:19.631
Shit.

01:10:20.341 --> 01:10:22.467
Captain Miller,
Captain Miller, do you copy? Over.

01:10:22.843 --> 01:10:25.261
Captain Miiier.
Captain Miiier, do you copy? Over.

01:10:25.346 --> 01:10:26.471
Go ahead, Smitty.

01:10:26.555 --> 01:10:29.515
I've just seen Weir
messing around on the Clark sir.

01:10:31.644 --> 01:10:34.229
Stand by, Smitty,
I wanna check something out.

01:10:39.818 --> 01:10:42.237
- Smith, get out of there.
- Come again, sir?

01:10:42.321 --> 01:10:44.239
One of the expiosives is missing
from the corridor.

01:10:44.323 --> 01:10:46.741
- Weir might have put it on the Clark.
- No. No way.

01:10:46.825 --> 01:10:49.452
No, sir, no way.
I've just put it back together, sir.

01:10:49.536 --> 01:10:51.871
Get off the Clark now, Smith!

01:11:01.006 --> 01:11:03.049
Where the fucking hell are you?

01:11:25.531 --> 01:11:27.198
Got you.

01:11:27.283 --> 01:11:29.242
Hang on, Smitty. I'm coming!

01:11:43.215 --> 01:11:44.257
No!

01:11:51.557 --> 01:12:36.476
Shit!

01:12:36.810 --> 01:12:38.186
Where the fuck am I going?

01:12:38.270 --> 01:12:41.272
Why does this shit got to happen to me?
Fuck.

01:12:43.275 --> 01:12:45.568
All right, think, Coop. Think. Think.

01:12:46.028 --> 01:12:49.739
All right, I got to get back to the ship.
I got to get back to the ship, all right.

01:12:49.823 --> 01:12:53.368
I gotta blow my air tank.
I'll blow my air tank.

01:12:55.162 --> 01:12:56.204
All right. Fuck.

01:12:56.288 --> 01:12:59.457
This better work. This shit better work.
All right.

01:12:59.875 --> 01:13:03.669
Here I go. All right.
One, two, three. Come on.

01:13:03.962 --> 01:13:07.298
Come on. Yes!

01:13:08.634 --> 01:13:11.219
Here I come, motherfuckers!

01:13:18.018 --> 01:13:19.185
D.J.

01:13:20.396 --> 01:13:22.522
- What was that?
- Clark's gone.

01:13:23.482 --> 01:13:26.359
- Smitty and Cooper are dead.
- What? What the...

01:13:26.485 --> 01:13:29.487
it was Weir.
You spot him, you take him out.

01:13:29.822 --> 01:13:31.239
Understood.

01:13:31.824 --> 01:13:34.826
- Be carefui, D.J.
- Don't worry about Weir.

01:13:35.828 --> 01:13:37.703
I'll take care of him.

01:13:47.673 --> 01:13:48.881
D.J.?

01:14:01.186 --> 01:14:04.772
D.J.? D.J., answer me!

01:14:52.613 --> 01:14:54.739
Okay, Dr. Weir.

01:14:59.119 --> 01:15:01.579
You don't wanna leave your ship?

01:15:02.456 --> 01:15:04.081
You never will.

01:16:03.141 --> 01:16:04.183
Starck.

01:16:26.665 --> 01:16:28.040
It's okay.

01:16:32.212 --> 01:16:34.338
I'm gonna get you out of here.

01:16:37.342 --> 01:16:38.551
Okay.

01:16:42.889 --> 01:16:44.223
Easy.

01:16:59.740 --> 01:17:01.782
Oh, my God.

01:17:03.577 --> 01:17:05.536
What happened to your eyes?

01:17:05.621 --> 01:17:09.457
Where we're going,
we won't need eyes to see.

01:17:09.541 --> 01:17:11.459
What are you talking about?

01:17:11.543 --> 01:17:15.463
I created the Event Horizon
to reach the stars.

01:17:16.256 --> 01:17:19.550
But she's gone
much, much further than that.

01:17:20.927 --> 01:17:23.387
She tore a hole in our universe,

01:17:23.472 --> 01:17:27.058
a gateway to another dimension.

01:17:27.726 --> 01:17:30.102
A dimension of pure chaos,

01:17:30.937 --> 01:17:33.397
pure evil.

01:17:33.899 --> 01:17:37.360
When she crossed over,
she was just a ship.

01:17:37.444 --> 01:17:39.570
But when she came back,

01:17:40.572 --> 01:17:43.074
she was alive.

01:17:44.284 --> 01:17:46.118
Look at her, Miller.

01:17:47.412 --> 01:17:50.456
Isn't she beautiful?

01:17:50.582 --> 01:17:54.919
Your beautiful ship
killed its crew, Doctor.

01:17:55.796 --> 01:17:57.254
Well,

01:17:58.799 --> 01:18:01.133
now she has another crew.

01:18:02.969 --> 01:18:05.304
Now she has us.

01:18:12.270 --> 01:18:15.022
What do you think you're doing, Doctor?

01:18:15.107 --> 01:18:18.275
You wanted to know where the ship
has been,

01:18:18.777 --> 01:18:20.986
so now you'll find out.

01:18:34.793 --> 01:18:39.213
- If you miss me, you blow out the hull.
- What makes you think I'll miss?

01:18:40.882 --> 01:18:42.508
That's right, I'm back!

01:18:42.634 --> 01:18:45.386
I'm... Shit, I can't stop. Hey!

01:18:45.470 --> 01:18:47.471
Hey! Fuck.

01:18:49.349 --> 01:18:52.351
What? Who the fuck? Oh, shit!

01:20:27.364 --> 01:20:30.407
Miller! Miller!

01:20:43.129 --> 01:20:44.922
Give me your hand!

01:20:53.932 --> 01:20:56.267
- Come on!
- I can't!

01:20:58.103 --> 01:20:59.937
I'm not leaving you.

01:21:19.958 --> 01:21:21.625
Forward airlock.

01:21:27.090 --> 01:21:28.591
It can't be Weir.

01:21:29.593 --> 01:21:31.802
I'm not taking any chances.

01:21:32.470 --> 01:21:34.305
You watch your back.

01:21:45.150 --> 01:21:47.276
- Yo! Don't hit me.
- Cooper!

01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:50.154
Take it off! Take it off!

01:21:51.323 --> 01:21:53.240
- I can't breathe. I can't breathe.
- You're okay.

01:21:53.325 --> 01:21:56.994
- You're okay. It's over.
- No, it's not.

01:21:57.621 --> 01:22:00.372
Weir's activated the gravity drive.
We got to shut it down.

01:22:00.457 --> 01:22:02.458
- How? The bridge is gone.
- What about Engineering?

01:22:02.542 --> 01:22:03.792
You think you can shut it down
from there?

01:22:03.877 --> 01:22:06.378
I don't know the process.
Dr. Weir was the expert.

01:22:06.463 --> 01:22:08.422
I don't want to go
where the other crew went, okay?

01:22:08.506 --> 01:22:09.798
- I'd rather be dead.
- Okay.

01:22:09.883 --> 01:22:12.259
- Okay, we blow the fucker up.
- We blow it up?

01:22:12.344 --> 01:22:15.512
Do like Weir said. Blow the corridor,

01:22:16.306 --> 01:22:20.267
separate us from the rest of ship.
Use the foredecks as a lifeboat.

01:22:20.769 --> 01:22:22.937
With any luck, TDRS will pick up
our emergency beacon.

01:22:23.021 --> 01:22:25.314
We prep the gravity couches,
put ourselves in stasis,

01:22:25.398 --> 01:22:27.149
and stand by
for a search and rescue team.

01:22:27.233 --> 01:22:29.610
Meantime, I'm gonna go
manually arm these explosives.

01:22:29.694 --> 01:22:31.904
- Skipper, will this shit work?
- It worked for Dr. Weir.

01:22:31.988 --> 01:22:34.281
You go activate the emergency beacon.
You get back here double-quick.

01:22:34.366 --> 01:22:36.158
- Yes, sir.
- I'll come with you.

01:22:36.242 --> 01:22:38.327
You stay here.
You prep the gravity couches.

01:22:38.411 --> 01:22:39.495
Miller.

01:22:41.706 --> 01:22:44.041
Close this door behind me, Lieutenant.

01:22:53.843 --> 01:22:57.888
Gateway opening in T minus
five minutes.

01:23:04.270 --> 01:23:06.689
Emergency beacon activated.

01:23:08.566 --> 01:23:10.401
Yes.

01:23:10.568 --> 01:23:11.902
Blood?

01:23:19.244 --> 01:23:21.078
Oh, fuck me.

01:23:21.746 --> 01:23:23.247
Fuck me.

01:23:24.207 --> 01:23:49.898
Starck!

01:23:54.279 --> 01:23:55.654
Run!

01:23:58.324 --> 01:24:02.745
Gateway opening in T minus
three minutes.

01:24:06.624 --> 01:24:09.793
Detonator reiease is authorized.

01:24:10.587 --> 01:24:13.464
The main corridor is now armed.

01:24:13.631 --> 01:24:15.758
We're armed. She's ready to blow.

01:24:16.092 --> 01:24:19.094
I repeat, we are armed.
She's ready to blow.

01:24:19.512 --> 01:24:21.930
Miller. Miller, can you hear me?

01:24:22.015 --> 01:24:24.099
We have to get out of here now.

01:24:26.644 --> 01:24:28.353
You let me burn.

01:24:45.997 --> 01:24:50.667
Gateway opening in T minus
two minutes.

01:25:06.976 --> 01:25:08.018
Miller.

01:25:27.705 --> 01:25:29.665
You left me behind.

01:25:32.043 --> 01:25:35.087
No, you're not Edmund Corrick.
I watched him die.

01:25:39.509 --> 01:25:41.009
Weir?

01:25:43.555 --> 01:25:47.474
The ship brought me back.
I told you she won't let me leave.

01:25:47.559 --> 01:25:49.768
She won't let anyone leave.

01:25:49.894 --> 01:25:52.688
Did you really think
you could destroy this ship?

01:25:53.022 --> 01:25:56.066
She's defied space and time.

01:25:56.609 --> 01:26:00.112
She's been to a place
you couldn't possibly imagine.

01:26:00.238 --> 01:26:01.947
And now,

01:26:02.407 --> 01:26:06.660
- it is time to go back.
- I know, to hell.

01:26:06.744 --> 01:26:10.122
You know nothing. Hell is only a word.

01:26:10.582 --> 01:26:14.918
The reality is much, much worse.

01:26:17.589 --> 01:26:20.591
Now let me show you.

01:26:21.968 --> 01:26:23.260
Help me!

01:26:26.598 --> 01:26:28.432
No!

01:26:30.476 --> 01:26:32.186
No.

01:26:32.270 --> 01:26:34.021
- You see?
- No.

01:26:34.105 --> 01:26:37.816
They're not dead. They're not dead.

01:26:37.942 --> 01:26:39.318
Not yet.

01:26:41.112 --> 01:26:43.071
You won't

01:26:43.156 --> 01:26:46.241
take my crew.

01:27:06.012 --> 01:27:09.848
They're not your crew anymore.
They belong to the ship.

01:27:09.974 --> 01:27:11.433
Gateway opening.

01:27:26.491 --> 01:27:27.824
Take me.

01:27:28.660 --> 01:27:30.535
You take me. You leave them alone.

01:27:30.620 --> 01:27:34.164
No. There is no escape.

01:27:36.292 --> 01:27:38.126
The gateway is open,

01:27:38.211 --> 01:27:41.171
and you are all coming with me.

01:27:45.843 --> 01:27:57.187
Do you see?

01:27:59.857 --> 01:28:01.191
Yes,

01:28:02.568 --> 01:28:04.361
I see.

01:28:07.699 --> 01:28:09.408
No!

01:29:30.198 --> 01:29:31.239
Miller.

01:29:38.706 --> 01:29:41.625
This is Rescue One. We have contact.

01:29:43.252 --> 01:29:46.630
Approaching the wreckage
of the Event Horizon.

01:29:46.714 --> 01:29:48.298
Prepare to board.

01:29:57.892 --> 01:30:00.268
I'm entering the grav couch bay.

01:30:00.937 --> 01:30:04.940
It doesn't appear to have been damaged
in the explosion.

01:30:06.484 --> 01:30:08.652
There appear to be three survivors:

01:30:09.112 --> 01:30:12.406
Cooper, Justin, Lieutenant Starck.

01:30:13.157 --> 01:30:16.076
Justin seems to have suffered
massive injuries

01:30:16.160 --> 01:30:17.911
but he's still alive.

01:30:19.831 --> 01:30:22.332
The grav couches still have power.

01:30:24.919 --> 01:30:27.170
I'm opening the first tank now.

01:30:37.306 --> 01:30:39.433
It's all right. It's okay.

01:30:39.517 --> 01:30:41.435
- You're safe now.
- Justin, Cooper.

01:30:41.519 --> 01:30:43.854
They're fine. They're with us.

01:30:45.356 --> 01:30:47.023
They're with us.

01:30:49.694 --> 01:30:52.946
- Starck. Starck.
- Stay calm. It's all right.

01:30:53.030 --> 01:30:54.948
- Calm down, it's me.
- Breathe deeply.

01:30:55.032 --> 01:30:56.241
- Starck.
- Breathe deeply.

01:30:56.325 --> 01:30:58.452
- It's the rescue team.
- I need a sedative here, now!

01:30:58.536 --> 01:31:01.455
- I got you, Starck. I got you.
- It's okay.

01:31:01.831 --> 01:31:03.290
I need a sedative here, now!

01:31:03.374 --> 01:31:05.375
Starck, it's the rescue team. We're safe.

01:31:05.460 --> 01:31:08.211
- Okay, okay, I need it now!
- We're safe.
