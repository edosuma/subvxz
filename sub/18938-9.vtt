00:06.047 --> 00:07.922
- What the hell is a baby
sprinkle?

00:07.922 --> 00:10.505
Is that contagious?
- Oh, it's like a baby shower,

00:10.505 --> 00:12.880
but because it's for my second
child it's smaller,

00:12.880 --> 00:16.672
so they call it a sprinkle.
Do you get it?

00:16.672 --> 00:18.005
- Yeah. You're having
a second shower

00:18.005 --> 00:19.463
and calling it something
different.

00:19.463 --> 00:21.713
- Aren't you still
breastfeeding your first kid?

00:21.713 --> 00:24.463
- Speaking of breastfeeding...
when did most of you stop?

00:24.463 --> 00:26.963
- I am now a full time resident
of formula city.

00:26.963 --> 00:29.297
- Nice. Good for you.
- Not so much by choice.

00:29.297 --> 00:32.088
- Well, I still breastfeed
both of my children.

00:32.088 --> 00:34.505
- Isn't your son 4?
- And a half.

00:34.505 --> 00:36.588
- Wow.
- I just quit.

00:36.588 --> 00:38.505
Oh, God, I'm in hog heaven.

00:38.505 --> 00:41.380
- Now Frankie, are you prepared
for the hormonal shift

00:41.380 --> 00:43.255
that can occur when you quit
breastfeeding?

00:43.255 --> 00:45.255
For many it's when
postpartum sets in.

00:45.255 --> 00:47.213
- Okay. Well, I already had
postpartum. Can't get it twice.

00:47.213 --> 00:48.297
It's like chicken pox.

00:48.297 --> 00:49.713
- That is for sure not true,
Frank.

00:49.713 --> 00:50.963
- Really?

00:50.963 --> 00:52.755
- Well, the good news
is you have a therapist,

00:52.755 --> 00:55.172
and a lactation consultant
at your service.

00:55.172 --> 00:58.130
In fact, if any of you have any
questions on the boob front.

01:00.088 --> 01:03.672
- Does it have to be strictly
lactation related?

01:03.672 --> 01:06.213
- Oh no. Do you have a general
breast query?

01:06.213 --> 01:07.755
- Oh yeah, Jenny,
how is that nipple?

01:07.755 --> 01:11.297
- No infected.
It's just complicated.

01:13.422 --> 01:16.505
- Tricky nipples pay my bills.

01:17.505 --> 01:18.922
♪♪♪

01:26.463 --> 01:27.713
- Kate!

01:27.713 --> 01:31.255
Is some one at the door?
What the... hell?

01:31.255 --> 01:33.005
- (Kate laughs)
- What's all this?

01:33.005 --> 01:36.047
- Good morning, mister!
- What are you doing?

01:36.047 --> 01:39.130
- Surprise! I got us
a couples massage.

01:39.130 --> 01:41.547
- What time is it?

01:41.547 --> 01:43.922
I have to take a shower.
This is...

01:43.922 --> 01:46.338
- No, wait hold on.
Let's just do like a shorty.

01:46.338 --> 01:48.713
It'll be a really nice way
to start the day.

01:48.713 --> 01:51.547
- (Reluctant) Okay.

01:51.547 --> 01:53.255
- You guys this is Nathan.

01:53.255 --> 01:54.922
He's cute, right?

02:03.088 --> 02:05.172
- Thank you.

02:05.172 --> 02:07.463
- He's got good hands.
Doesn't he? Gene?

02:07.463 --> 02:09.672
He's rubbed me down
so many times.

02:09.672 --> 02:12.380
- Actually sorry, that just
a little too much pressure.

02:12.380 --> 02:14.963
- (sighs) Are you relaxed?

02:14.963 --> 02:18.255
- Relaxed? I'm being held
hostage on a card table.

02:18.255 --> 02:21.213
- So, listen, I was hoping we
could talk about something.

02:21.213 --> 02:24.130
You know, my favorite part of a
massage is usually the silence.

02:24.130 --> 02:26.255
- (Laughs) No totally.

02:26.255 --> 02:28.297
The thing it's about
the Montreal job.

02:28.297 --> 02:30.755
- Kate, come on, I know you'd
love to compete it out

02:30.755 --> 02:33.380
on this one, but we agreed
that now is not the time.

02:33.380 --> 02:35.422
- Well, it's just hard
to like agree on something

02:35.422 --> 02:37.130
if we haven't really
discussed it.

02:37.130 --> 02:40.547
- Ow! I said, not so hard.
I've got knots.

02:40.547 --> 02:44.255
(Frustrated) God! Why is this
table so damn slippery?

02:44.255 --> 02:46.755
- Oh, it's just the essential
oils doing their thing.

02:46.755 --> 02:49.922
- (Sighs) Why do we have
to have this discussion now?

02:49.922 --> 02:51.922
- I'm sorry, are you the only
person who gets to decide

02:51.922 --> 02:53.547
when we discuss things?

02:53.547 --> 02:57.547
- All right, you wanna talk?
Fine. You shouldn't go.

02:57.547 --> 02:59.088
How are we supposed
to have another kid

02:59.088 --> 03:00.630
when you're hundreds
of miles away?

03:00.630 --> 03:03.297
- We're not, okay?
I'm sorry, Nathan,

03:03.297 --> 03:05.130
but the idea of going
through all of that again.

03:05.130 --> 03:07.922
- We've covered this?
Only children are like aliens!

03:07.922 --> 03:09.797
- Only children are fine.

03:09.797 --> 03:12.463
And their parents are sane,
clean-haired people

03:12.463 --> 03:14.463
with careers and brunch plans.

03:14.463 --> 03:16.630
- I don't want brunch plans.
I want another kid!

03:16.630 --> 03:19.213
- Yeah? Well, if you want
another baby so damn bad

03:19.213 --> 03:21.255
you fucking have it.
'Cause guess what?

03:21.255 --> 03:23.630
Not only did I already
submit my name for the job...

03:23.630 --> 03:25.463
I got it.

03:29.005 --> 03:31.130
- Wow!

03:33.505 --> 03:36.297
- Wait. Hold on.
Where are you going?

03:36.297 --> 03:38.338
Nathan you're covered
in Ylang-Ylang.

03:40.963 --> 03:42.755
- So, funny story:

03:42.755 --> 03:45.755
you remember that investment
I made a little while ago?

03:45.755 --> 03:48.255
Good news: big return.

03:48.255 --> 03:50.047
Big return.

03:50.047 --> 03:52.297
The bad news is: I thought
I'd be able to access

03:52.297 --> 03:56.797
the money by now so it's gonna
be a few more months...

03:58.130 --> 03:59.505
so...

03:59.505 --> 04:02.047
- So? We work; we have money.

04:02.047 --> 04:03.880
- Mhm. Yeah. Yeah.

04:03.880 --> 04:06.172
I mean, in theory we do.

04:07.338 --> 04:09.213
I'm waiting on a big check
from a client

04:09.213 --> 04:11.255
and you're kinda part-timing
it, so our cash flow

04:11.255 --> 04:13.505
it's kinda taking a bit
of a pregnant pause.

04:13.505 --> 04:15.130
- Lionel, you're a contingency
planner.

04:15.130 --> 04:17.005
How do you not have a
contingency plan for this?

04:17.005 --> 04:18.380
- I have one!

04:18.380 --> 04:20.838
It's that you take on
a few more patients.

04:20.838 --> 04:22.380
Just for a little while
To see us through--

04:22.380 --> 04:24.213
- Are you serious with
this shit right now?

04:24.213 --> 04:26.297
- I kind of am. Yeah!

04:29.422 --> 04:31.713
All right.

04:31.713 --> 04:33.922
I can see you're thinking
about this.

04:33.922 --> 04:37.172
I will let you enjoy
that bagel in peace.

04:37.172 --> 04:39.588
Good talk. Good talk.

04:44.838 --> 04:47.047
(Phone buzzes)

04:49.255 --> 04:50.380
Hello?

04:50.380 --> 04:52.672
Wendy: Frank! Where are ya?

04:52.672 --> 04:54.880
- Oh, hey Wendy. I'm ah...

04:56.130 --> 04:57.630
ah...

04:57.630 --> 04:59.880
I'm just running some errands.

04:59.880 --> 05:01.630
- Well, don't forget you have
to come in

05:01.630 --> 05:03.838
and sign those papers
from Tuesday.

05:03.838 --> 05:06.255
- Yes, right. It's on,
it's on the top of my list.

05:06.255 --> 05:07.963
I'll be there first thing
tomorrow.

05:07.963 --> 05:09.713
- And the photographer
is coming to your place

05:09.713 --> 05:12.463
at five o'clock today
to take your new headshot,

05:12.463 --> 05:14.297
remember to wear red.

05:14.297 --> 05:16.213
Winners wear red!

05:16.213 --> 05:20.005
- Yep! Red shirt! I have one.

05:20.005 --> 05:23.088
- That's my girl.
I will see you tomorrow!

05:23.088 --> 05:24.463
- Cool.

05:25.630 --> 05:27.380
(Approaching footsteps)

05:38.047 --> 05:40.255
- (Groans)

05:42.463 --> 05:45.172
- Oh my God, Kate,
you must be so excited!

05:45.172 --> 05:46.755
- Yeah. It's pretty awesome.

05:46.755 --> 05:49.297
- And the CEO of Gaze
sent you a gift basket.

05:49.297 --> 05:52.338
And I got to sign for it.
We're both winners today!

05:52.338 --> 05:55.047
- Yeah. Nothing says respect
like a dozen savory jams

05:55.047 --> 05:56.672
and a dessert wine.

05:56.672 --> 05:58.380
- So have you worked
with her before?

05:58.380 --> 06:01.338
- No. But I've wanted to
since I've started here.

06:01.338 --> 06:03.547
I mean, as far as
"working women" go,

06:03.547 --> 06:06.005
Stromanger is the man.

06:06.005 --> 06:08.213
This is a woman who founded
her own company

06:08.213 --> 06:12.172
all while raising three kids
and being a black-belt in Judo.

06:12.172 --> 06:13.838
- Wow.

06:13.838 --> 06:16.838
Is Judo the one with the sticks?

06:16.838 --> 06:19.213
- No.
- Hey, hey, what's this?

06:19.213 --> 06:21.380
- Oh, that's just um--

06:21.380 --> 06:25.172
- You got Montreal.
- I did.

06:25.172 --> 06:28.005
- (Sighs) You know what, Kate?

06:28.005 --> 06:30.213
I am not at all surprised.

06:30.213 --> 06:31.463
As high as my hopes might
have been,

06:31.463 --> 06:33.213
I pretty much knew you'd get it;

06:33.213 --> 06:35.963
and you deserve it.

06:35.963 --> 06:38.422
- Thanks, Mo.
That means a lot to me.

06:38.422 --> 06:40.630
- It makes sense that
the more seasoned,

06:40.630 --> 06:42.880
older person get the job.

06:42.880 --> 06:44.672
- Yeah. I guess that does
make sense.

06:44.672 --> 06:47.047
- And I mean, this is like,

06:47.047 --> 06:48.755
it's last chance
if you think about it.

06:48.755 --> 06:50.588
If they hadn't offered you this,

06:50.588 --> 06:52.505
it would have been like,
"hello glass ceiling!"

06:52.505 --> 06:54.630
- Thanks for stopping by, Mo.
- Okay.

06:54.630 --> 06:56.880
- Rosie, what are you doing?

06:58.297 --> 07:00.505
- Smelling your jams.

07:00.505 --> 07:02.338
- And remember to do
your kegels.

07:02.338 --> 07:04.463
They really help with
the incontinence.

07:04.463 --> 07:06.880
Oh... and with sex.

07:08.880 --> 07:11.838
Jenny! What a fabulous surprise!

07:11.838 --> 07:14.297
- (Jenny winces)
- Oh! What happened?

07:14.297 --> 07:15.463
- I...

07:16.588 --> 07:19.005
I need your help.

07:19.005 --> 07:23.755
- Oh. I thought this might be
a social call.

07:23.755 --> 07:27.588
- No. But... we can be social
while you help me...?

07:27.588 --> 07:29.338
- Yes, we can!

07:29.338 --> 07:31.672
Now sit down
and show me your tits.

07:31.672 --> 07:36.297
♪♪♪

07:36.297 --> 07:38.505
- Do you feel like you might be
repeating a pattern?

07:38.505 --> 07:40.922
- What'd'you mean, "a pattern"?

07:40.922 --> 07:42.755
Like, it's not my fault
that all the guys I meet

07:42.755 --> 07:45.255
are commitment phobic
narcissists with bad credit,

07:45.255 --> 07:47.213
is it?

07:47.213 --> 07:51.338
- ...and he raised the rent,
so now... now I have to move.

07:51.338 --> 07:53.213
- That must be quite upsetting.

07:53.213 --> 07:56.172
- Well, he's Jewish,
so, you know.

07:58.380 --> 08:00.713
- So, I wanna have kids,
and he says he doesn't,

08:00.713 --> 08:02.130
but I think he's just scared,

08:02.130 --> 08:04.880
so I took out my IUD
and I haven't told him.

08:04.880 --> 08:08.088
- You had your IUD removed?
- No. I took it out.

08:08.088 --> 08:10.588
It was so painful.

08:10.588 --> 08:12.505
- I really don't think that
you are supposed to do that.

08:12.505 --> 08:13.838
I mean, it's not a tampon.

08:13.838 --> 08:15.505
- No, I found the string
and just--

08:15.505 --> 08:17.338
- You know what? I'm not sure
that I really even

08:17.338 --> 08:19.338
recommend having kids.
I mean, it has its moments,

08:19.338 --> 08:21.463
but they put a serious
cramp in my day.

08:21.463 --> 08:23.547
From conception on,
they're like these little jerks

08:23.547 --> 08:26.213
that never really appreciate
anything at all.

08:26.213 --> 08:28.963
- Um... are you okay?
- (Burps) Yeah.

08:28.963 --> 08:31.380
Of course I am. I'm fine.
- It's just that you said

08:31.380 --> 08:33.213
some really inappropriate
stuff just now.

08:33.213 --> 08:35.047
- Says the girl who pulled
an IUD out of her body

08:35.047 --> 08:38.255
like she was picking carrots.
Look, these things aren't pets.

08:38.255 --> 08:39.963
Okay, you can't leave
them at home

08:39.963 --> 08:42.422
with a bowl of water
while you go out.

08:42.422 --> 08:45.130
And you want to do this without
even consulting your partner?

08:45.130 --> 08:46.880
What?! Are you crazy?

08:46.880 --> 08:48.838
Why is this room spinning?

08:48.838 --> 08:51.088
(Fainting moan, falling thud)

08:54.422 --> 08:57.838
- Anne! What happened!

08:57.838 --> 08:59.588
- She fainted.

08:59.588 --> 09:02.172
- Fran, I fell on my stomach.

09:02.172 --> 09:04.380
- Okay. Okay.
Let's get you in the car.

09:04.380 --> 09:08.213
- I feel like I should come!
- No, stay!

09:08.213 --> 09:10.130
Okay. Easy!

09:10.130 --> 09:12.880
- I killed this baby.
I killed it, I know I did.

09:12.880 --> 09:15.088
- I'm sure the baby's fine
and if it's not,

09:15.088 --> 09:16.338
it is NOT your fault.

09:16.338 --> 09:18.088
- Did you know I've been
referring to this baby

09:18.088 --> 09:19.505
as a "virus"?

09:19.505 --> 09:21.547
- Well, it has been making you
throw up, like a virus.

09:21.547 --> 09:24.422
- No. I did this. Okay?
I wished this away.

09:24.422 --> 09:26.755
I like killed it with my mind
or something,

09:26.755 --> 09:29.588
like I was some kind
of weird witch... I...

09:29.588 --> 09:31.422
Sorry. I didn't...

09:31.422 --> 09:34.838
- It sounds like you're being
really hard on yourself.

09:37.047 --> 09:39.338
Also, that's not how
witchcraft works.

09:39.338 --> 09:41.588
You'd have had to used a spell.

09:42.588 --> 09:43.755
(Knocks)

09:43.755 --> 09:45.547
- Enter at your own risk!

09:45.547 --> 09:47.797
- Oh, Richard,
is this a bad time?

09:47.797 --> 09:50.338
- Ah, Kate! No. Come on in!

09:50.338 --> 09:53.047
I'm just being silly.

09:53.047 --> 09:55.255
You know what they call me,
"Silly Richard."

09:55.255 --> 09:56.922
- I did not know that.
- Sit down.

09:56.922 --> 09:59.297
- Oh.
- What's up?

09:59.630 --> 10:02.630
- Well, I was hoping to discuss
Montreal-job-logistics.

10:02.630 --> 10:07.297
- Right. Okay. Uh...
can you leave in a week?

10:07.297 --> 10:09.838
- Oh wow. Really?

10:09.838 --> 10:12.838
Uh... yeah. Yeah.

10:12.838 --> 10:15.755
I just have to tie up
some loose ends, like...

10:15.755 --> 10:18.672
like my family's wellbeing.
(Awkward chuckle)

10:18.672 --> 10:20.880
- Did Nathan take the news
all right?

10:20.880 --> 10:22.797
- Oh, yea-- honestly...

10:22.797 --> 10:25.422
he was very supportive.

10:25.422 --> 10:29.213
Gave me a big old hug
and was like go get 'em!

10:30.338 --> 10:32.338
- You've worked really hard
for this.

10:32.338 --> 10:34.172
I'm so proud of you.

10:34.172 --> 10:36.338
You're like the son I never had.

10:36.338 --> 10:38.880
- Oh, thanks, Richard.
You're like the dad I nev-

10:38.880 --> 10:41.838
like another dad
that I... have.

10:41.838 --> 10:45.172
Oh, Victoria Stromanger sent me
a beautiful gift basket.

10:45.172 --> 10:47.213
- Really?
- Yeah.

10:47.213 --> 10:50.088
- Which reminds me, do you have
any tips on Victoria?

10:50.088 --> 10:52.880
- Well, s-she likes a firm
handshake.

10:52.880 --> 10:54.505
- But she's from Montreal.

10:54.505 --> 10:56.755
Doesn't she do the whole
"kiss-kiss" thing?

10:56.755 --> 10:58.172
- Oh, yeah, yeah, both.

10:58.172 --> 11:00.088
She wants to feel the
confidence in the hand

11:00.088 --> 11:02.505
and the French Canadianism
in the mouth.

11:02.505 --> 11:05.963
- Got it. So,
firm hand and mouth.

11:05.963 --> 11:07.380
What are her kids names again?

11:07.380 --> 11:09.172
- I don't think she's ever
mentioned them.

11:09.172 --> 11:12.047
- It's like woman in the work
place 101... I like it.

11:12.047 --> 11:14.838
- You're gonna be so great.
You know that.

11:14.838 --> 11:17.838
Come on, give me one of those
famous hugs.

11:21.005 --> 11:23.088
(Small chuckle, pats her back)

11:23.088 --> 11:25.130
This in not "sexual harassment"
of any kind.

11:25.130 --> 11:27.380
- No, Richard. You're fine.
- Okay. Okay.

11:29.047 --> 11:31.088
- So, what seems to be
the problem?

11:31.088 --> 11:33.005
- Well--
- You got a clog?

11:33.005 --> 11:35.005
- No, I--
- Chapped nips? Bleeding?

11:35.005 --> 11:36.838
You got bloody nipples? Oh!

11:36.838 --> 11:39.422
- Yeah, I kind of pierced
my nipple

11:39.422 --> 11:42.463
and I guess it got infected.

11:42.463 --> 11:44.297
- I love nipple rings.

11:45.505 --> 11:47.297
This is fun.

11:47.297 --> 11:49.297
This should help with the pain.

11:49.297 --> 11:51.755
(Spritzes, gasps with relief)

11:52.755 --> 11:55.047
Okay, what'd'ya wanna do here?

11:55.047 --> 11:57.672
You wanna take this thing out?

11:57.672 --> 11:59.630
- You think I could keep it?

11:59.630 --> 12:01.547
Or is it too far gone?

12:01.547 --> 12:05.630
I just kinda feel like doing
this was kinda like a rebirth.

12:05.630 --> 12:08.380
Does it sound stupid?
- Girl, I get it.

12:09.713 --> 12:12.297
This one time, in university,

12:12.297 --> 12:14.547
I died my hair brown.

12:14.547 --> 12:16.547
It was nuts!

12:18.130 --> 12:19.588
Sometimes you gotta do
something crazy

12:19.588 --> 12:22.380
to remember who you are.

12:22.380 --> 12:24.005
- (Gasps in pain)

12:24.005 --> 12:25.672
Ooh... (Winces)

12:27.547 --> 12:29.547
Can I stop breastfeeding,

12:29.547 --> 12:32.047
or will I be a terrible mom?

12:32.047 --> 12:34.922
- Formula exists for a reason.

12:34.922 --> 12:36.838
If you're done, you're done.

12:38.505 --> 12:40.088
You go, girl.

12:41.713 --> 12:43.422

this beast, right?

13:03.588 --> 13:05.213
- Yeah.

13:07.505 --> 13:08.797
- Better?

13:08.797 --> 13:11.380
- Um... hah.

13:11.380 --> 13:13.088
- Okay. Can we just take
the photo, please?

13:13.088 --> 13:17.588
- Sure. Great. Could you move
a couple inches to your right.

13:17.588 --> 13:22.213
Okay. (Shutter clicks)

13:22.213 --> 13:24.630
Maybe a little smile? You know?

13:24.630 --> 13:28.630
People wanna buy houses
from happy people, right?

13:28.630 --> 13:30.380
Yeah? Okay.

- Yeah. I'm fine.
Just keep going.

13:44.463 --> 13:47.213
- Okay. I can. It's just
that I'm too sure

13:47.213 --> 13:51.422
that people want this staring
back at them from a bench.

13:51.422 --> 13:54.797
- Or is it exactly
what they want?

13:56.297 --> 13:58.297
- No?

14:00.130 --> 14:02.797
- Well, the baby's fine!
- What?

14:02.797 --> 14:04.963
- Yeah, you probably just
fainted

14:04.963 --> 14:06.630
because you have low blood
pressure,

14:06.630 --> 14:08.422
which is pretty normal.
- I don't understand.

14:08.422 --> 14:11.422
I fell on him...
- Well, he or she...

14:11.422 --> 14:14.255

this little baby... trooper.

Thank you.

14:31.172 --> 14:33.838
- What? Yeah, yeah-yeah.

14:33.838 --> 14:35.963
Of course it is.

14:35.963 --> 14:38.088
- You don't seem happy.

14:38.088 --> 14:41.588
- I guess I was just thinking
that if this baby were gone,

14:41.588 --> 14:43.797
that might be a good thing.

14:43.797 --> 14:46.422
You know, like they say that
that babies are blessings,

14:46.422 --> 14:49.047
but maybe the absence of a baby
can be a blessing too?

14:49.047 --> 14:52.255
- For sure. I have no kids
and I feel super blessed.

14:52.255 --> 14:56.547
- Fuck, we can't afford this.
- You guys are broke?

14:56.547 --> 14:58.130
- Okay, Anne.

14:58.130 --> 15:00.922
It appears you have a
subchorionic hematoma.

15:00.922 --> 15:02.422
- What the fuck is that?

15:02.422 --> 15:04.422
- Basically, you have a pool
of blood

15:04.422 --> 15:06.463
between your uterus
and your placenta.

15:06.463 --> 15:09.047
It could be fine, but it could
lead to a miscarriage;

15:09.047 --> 15:11.672
so if you start bleeding,
it'll mean bed rest.

15:11.672 --> 15:14.713
- I don't do bed rest.
- You still working?

15:14.713 --> 15:16.338

20:23.672 --> 20:25.005
or your son.

20:25.005 --> 20:27.422
- All I do is consider
the both of you.

20:27.422 --> 20:31.380
Okay but... I'm sorry,
but this is bullshit.

20:31.380 --> 20:33.380
- May I have some water?

20:35.797 --> 20:37.172
- Yeah.

20:45.172 --> 20:48.005
- Look, we're gonna be fine
financially.

20:48.005 --> 20:50.047
My job can cover us.

20:50.047 --> 20:52.297
- I'm sorry, did this just
shift into a conversation

20:52.297 --> 20:54.588
about me quitting?
- No! I mean,

20:54.588 --> 20:55.963
not for a little while.

20:55.963 --> 20:58.588
- Nathan, I'm about to make
a significant raise.

20:58.588 --> 21:02.547
Because of me we could
potentially get out of debt.

21:02.547 --> 21:07.380
- Well, fuck me, I guess you
don't even need me, Kate.

21:07.380 --> 21:09.172
- Should maybe I go?
- Yes.

21:09.172 --> 21:10.713
- Loving the sound of that.
