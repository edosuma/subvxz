20:04.704 --> 20:07.705
- YOU TRIED IT?
- DUSTY DID.

20:07.707 --> 20:10.508
LOOK, WE WERE BUZZED
OFF THE HEIST AND HE JUST...

20:10.510 --> 20:12.376
HE JUST GAVE IT A GO.

20:12.378 --> 20:14.645
LOOK, I DON'T NEED THIS SHIT,
MAN, I DON'T.

20:14.647 --> 20:16.480
JUST WATCH THIS.

20:17.883 --> 20:20.718
WHAT...

20:23.222 --> 20:24.422
HUNTER?

20:28.393 --> 20:29.627
HUNTER?

20:35.567 --> 20:36.901
WHAT'RE YOU DOIN'?

20:36.903 --> 20:38.236
WHAT'RE YOU... NO!

20:48.547 --> 20:50.381
YOU GOT ANOTHER LINE?

20:56.455 --> 20:57.855
NOT GONNA GET
MUCH OF A CHANCE TO DO THIS

20:57.857 --> 20:58.990
AFTER I LEAVE.

21:03.328 --> 21:07.031
THIS THING'S
ALWAYS BEEN BROKEN.

21:07.033 --> 21:08.532
IT'S NOT BROKE.

21:08.534 --> 21:10.468
YOU JUST DON'T KNOW
HOW TO USE IT.

21:20.646 --> 21:23.014
WHEN I FIRST
GOT TO TOWN I...

21:23.016 --> 21:25.950
I DON'T KNOW, I THOUGHT
I'D BE OUT HERE MORE OFTEN.

21:34.060 --> 21:36.294
GOD, I'M GONNA MISS
THIS PLACE.

21:36.296 --> 21:38.062
THEN WHY ARE YOU LEAVIN'?

21:40.565 --> 21:43.434
THIS ISN'T MY WORLD.

21:43.436 --> 21:45.069
I CAN'T STAY HERE FOREVER.

21:46.838 --> 21:49.006
BESIDES, I'M IN MY 30S.

21:49.008 --> 21:51.742
I'M READY
FOR THE BIG LEAGUES.

21:51.744 --> 21:54.545
ISN'T 40 LIKE THE NEW 20
OR SOMETHING?

22:03.388 --> 22:04.689
JUST...

22:08.727 --> 22:10.628
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF.

22:15.734 --> 22:17.034
YOU, TOO.

22:23.675 --> 22:26.377
WHAT THE FUCK?

22:26.379 --> 22:28.346
I KNOW, RIGHT?

22:29.681 --> 22:32.850
SERIOUSLY, MAN.
WHAT THE FUCK?

22:32.852 --> 22:36.721
DUSTY'S HAND GOT SLICED
IN THE HEIST.

22:36.723 --> 22:39.724
AND WHEN HE TRIED THIS...

22:39.726 --> 22:40.991
POOF.

22:40.993 --> 22:42.126
JUST GONE.

22:44.029 --> 22:45.730
I DECIDED
TO TRY IT MYSELF.

22:45.732 --> 22:48.866
I CUT MYSELF TO RIBBONS.

22:48.868 --> 22:50.468
I GOT NO SCARS OR NOTHIN'.

22:53.672 --> 22:56.741
YOU WANNA TRY?

22:56.743 --> 22:59.744
NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

22:59.746 --> 23:02.012
WELL, HERE.

23:02.014 --> 23:04.749
TAKE A POKE.

23:04.751 --> 23:08.452
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

23:08.454 --> 23:11.589
YEAH, I'M SERIOUS.

23:11.591 --> 23:13.524
COME ON,
BEFORE IT WEARS OFF.

23:16.796 --> 23:20.164
BOO. PUSSY.

23:25.471 --> 23:29.440
IT'S A NICE LITTLE BUZZ
TO TOP IT ALL OFF, TOO.

23:29.442 --> 23:31.776

- DUSTY TRIED TWO AT ONCE.

23:31.778 --> 23:34.478

WE GOTTA GO GET HER.

23:39.819 --> 23:41.819
- YOU KNOW WHERE SHE IS?
- YEAH, DIAMOND RIDGE.

23:41.821 --> 23:43.687
LIKE I SAID,
THAT'S HER PLACE.

23:43.689 --> 23:46.490
ALL RIGHT, FINE.
LEAD THE WAY.

24:01.506 --> 24:03.107
YOU'RE FINE, MAN.
ALL RIGHT, STAY CALM.

24:03.109 --> 24:05.676
BROTHER, YOU'RE FINE.
HOW DO YOU USE ONE OF THESE?

24:05.678 --> 24:08.546
WE'LL GET TO HER.
I PROMISE, ALL RIGHT?

24:10.049 --> 24:11.749
EYES ON ME, MAN!

24:11.751 --> 24:13.050
EYES ON ME, HUNTER!

24:14.753 --> 24:17.054
HUNTER?

26:07.632 --> 26:09.700
THERE WAS SOMEONE ELSE
WITH BLUM.

26:12.604 --> 26:13.971
AND...

26:15.974 --> 26:19.243
AND HE GOT AWAY.

26:19.245 --> 26:21.011
SO, YOU FAILED.

26:21.013 --> 26:23.147
I WILL HANDLE...

26:23.149 --> 26:27.084
THIS SHOULD HAVE
ALREADY BEEN HANDLED.

26:33.792 --> 26:35.659
HOW MUCH HAVE YOU USED?

26:35.661 --> 26:37.928
ENOUGH TO GET
THE JOB DONE.

26:37.930 --> 26:40.864
YOU'RE CREATING
AN EM FIELD.

26:40.866 --> 26:44.868
- HOW MUCH HAVE YOU USED?
- ALL OF IT.

26:44.870 --> 26:47.171
THAT'S WHY
I NEED TO BE RESUPPLIED.

26:47.173 --> 26:50.674
YOU WERE GIVEN
A THREE-DAY SUPPLY.

26:52.944 --> 26:54.645
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU USED?

26:57.782 --> 27:00.684
- LAST NIGHT.
- AND YOU'RE ALREADY SORE?

27:33.785 --> 27:35.953
IS, UH...

27:35.955 --> 27:37.254
IS THAT IT?

27:40.091 --> 27:43.060
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO OVERDO IT.

27:48.033 --> 27:50.868
I EXPECT MUCH BETTER OF YOU
FROM HERE ON OUT.

27:56.107 --> 27:58.142
GO MAKE THIS RIGHT.

28:11.990 --> 28:13.891
HAVE YOURSELF A LITTLE PARTY?

28:16.728 --> 28:19.229
MRS. KITNER CALLED
ABOUT A TRESPASSER

28:19.231 --> 28:20.898
SLEEPING IN HER SHED.

28:22.801 --> 28:25.069

-GUESS NOT.
-YOU GOT ANY WEAPONS
OR DRUGS ON YOU?

29:08.813 --> 29:10.447
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT.

29:30.368 --> 29:32.202
WANNA TELL ME
WHOSE BLOOD THAT IS?

29:42.914 --> 29:44.848

SON.

29:54.960 --> 29:56.260
DRUG TEST.

29:59.264 --> 30:01.398
WHAT AM I GONNA FIND
WHEN I OPEN THAT CASE?

30:13.144 --> 30:16.013
BOY WAS STONED
OUT OF HIS MIND.

30:16.015 --> 30:17.481
COME IN, SHERIFF.

30:21.886 --> 30:23.053

30:23.055 --> 30:26.123
WE GOT A HELL OF A MESS

30:31.830 --> 30:33.130
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

30:37.001 --> 30:39.002
FIGURE HIS COUSIN DID IT?

30:39.004 --> 30:41.138
I DO NOT KNOW.

30:43.474 --> 30:46.476
SEEMS LIKELY,
IF YOU ASK ME.

30:46.478 --> 30:48.145
I DIDN'T.

30:50.582 --> 30:52.416
THOUGHTS, SHERIFF.

30:54.485 --> 30:56.954
YEAH, I GOT A FEW.

30:56.956 --> 30:58.922
SHERIFF, COME IN.

HE WAS GONNA OFF HIMSELF

31:23.349 --> 31:26.516

31:26.518 --> 31:28.018
SHERIFF?

31:30.021 --> 31:32.055

WHAT'S GOING ON TODAY?
WHERE IS EVERYONE?

32:07.326 --> 32:08.558
WELL, MA'AM,

32:08.560 --> 32:10.093
TODAY'S BEEN A BIT

32:10.095 --> 32:12.262
- EXCUSE MY LANGUAGE.

32:12.264 --> 32:14.264
I DON'T WANT TO ALARM YOU,
BUT, UH,

- A FEW PEOPLE GOT MURDERED.
- OH, MY GOD.

32:17.236 --> 32:18.568
I KNOW
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO NOTIFY

32:18.570 --> 32:20.671
FAMILY FIRST AND ALL,
BUT LOOKS LIKE ONE

32:20.673 --> 32:22.072
OF THE BODIES WAS SOMEONE

32:22.074 --> 32:25.142
- WHO USED TO WORK FOR YOU.

32:31.650 --> 32:33.650

32:33.652 --> 32:35.485
I WISH THAT WAS TRUE,
MA'AM.

32:38.156 --> 32:39.589
YOU KNOW WHAT?

32:39.591 --> 32:43.327
HE LOOKS
A LITTLE FAMILIAR.

32:43.329 --> 32:45.495
- YEAH?
- YEAH.

32:45.497 --> 32:47.998
HE MIGHT'VE BEEN
ONE OF MY GUYS AT THE PLANT.

32:49.667 --> 32:51.501
YOU THINK I COULD SPEAK
WITH HIM?

32:51.503 --> 32:53.403
MS. WALKER,
I DON'T WANT TO GET

32:53.405 --> 32:54.538
IN ANY TROUBLE,
AND, YOU KNOW,

32:54.540 --> 32:55.639
I DON'T WANT TO PUT YOU

32:55.641 --> 32:57.274
- IN HARMS WAY.
- OF COURSE NOT.

32:57.276 --> 32:59.476
I WAS JUST THINKING
THAT MAYBE I COULD HELP.

32:59.478 --> 33:02.579
YOU KNOW, I HAVE HIS FILE
AND HIS RESUME.

33:02.581 --> 33:04.514
THAT COULD BE
USEFUL INFORMATION FOR YOU.

33:09.988 --> 33:12.055
YOU MAKE IT QUICK
AND YOU KEEP THIS
BETWEEN US, OKAY?

33:12.057 --> 33:14.658
OUR SECRET.

33:27.373 --> 33:28.672
IT'S GONNA BE FINE.

33:31.042 --> 33:33.443
IT'LL BE FINE.

33:33.445 --> 33:36.146
I'LL BE RIGHT OUTSIDE
IF YOU NEED ME, MA'AM.

33:36.148 --> 33:37.614
THANK YOU.

33:44.422 --> 33:46.790
DID YOU USE ANY OF IT?

33:46.792 --> 33:49.159
THE SYRINGE,
DID YOU USE ANY OF IT?

33:51.162 --> 33:52.629
YOU HAVE.
I CAN TELL.

33:54.232 --> 33:56.666
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT THAT STUFF WILL DO

33:56.668 --> 33:58.402
WITHOUT PROPER TREATMENT?

33:59.437 --> 34:01.571
IT'S UGLY.

34:01.573 --> 34:03.473
WHO ARE YOU?

34:03.475 --> 34:04.808
I'M THE PERSON
WHO'S GONNA MAKE THIS

34:04.810 --> 34:06.476
A LOT EASIER ON YOU.

34:08.679 --> 34:10.246
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

34:10.248 --> 34:12.716
I JUST WANT BACK THE PRODUCT
THAT WAS STOLEN.

34:15.053 --> 34:16.719
YOU KILLED MY COUSIN.

34:33.737 --> 34:35.739
WELL, YOU KNOW I DIDN'T.

34:35.741 --> 34:38.442
BUT YOU KNOW WHO DID.

34:38.444 --> 34:41.143
SEE NOW,
WE'RE GETTING OFF TOPIC.

34:41.146 --> 34:43.480
BECAUSE YOU NEED
TO UNDERSTAND

34:43.482 --> 34:47.284
THIS SUBSTANCE
THAT YOU'VE USED,

34:47.286 --> 34:49.719
YOU'RE NOT GONNA LAST LONG
WITHOUT IT.

34:49.721 --> 34:51.688
HOW'S THAT?

34:51.690 --> 34:55.125
WELL,
IT DOESN'T LAST FOREVER.

34:55.127 --> 34:57.794
WHATEVER HOLE
THAT YOU'VE PLUGGED,

34:57.796 --> 35:00.764
IN A COUPLE DAYS,
IT'S COMING BACK.

35:03.367 --> 35:04.768

35:57.623 --> 35:59.756
BUT WE ALSO
FOUND THIS INSIDE.

36:13.204 --> 36:14.504

36:17.208 --> 36:20.544
A LITTLE FANCY
FOR SOME JUNKIES.

36:20.546 --> 36:22.879
WHERE YOU FIGURE
THEY'RE GETTING THESE?

36:22.881 --> 36:24.781
MY BEST GUESS
IS THE SAME PLACE

36:24.783 --> 36:26.216
THEY'RE GETTING
THESE CHEMICALS.

36:27.885 --> 36:30.287
BARREL'S GOT
CARROLL STAMPS ON IT.

36:34.392 --> 36:37.394

42:25.609 --> 42:27.110

42:27.112 --> 42:29.779
I SWEAR TO GOD.

42:29.781 --> 42:33.283

42:48.066 --> 42:49.066
DUSTY?

42:50.568 --> 42:54.270
YEAH, I BARELY GOT AWAY.
THE COPS THINK I DID IT.

42:58.142 --> 42:59.609
I'M SORRY.

43:02.580 --> 43:05.315
WHO DO I NEED TO SPEAK WITH
TO GET HIS RECORDS RELEASED?

43:05.317 --> 43:07.951
-YEAH, IF I COULD JUST

-NO, I SPOKE TO HIM YESTERDAY.

43:07.953 --> 43:12.055

43:29.841 --> 43:31.774
HOW YOU CAN LOSE
AN ENTIRE DRUM OF CHEMICALS

43:31.776 --> 43:33.977
AND NOT NOTICE?

43:33.979 --> 43:37.347
WELL, THERE WAS A BREAK-IN
LAST WEEK.

43:37.349 --> 43:39.215
WHY DIDN'T YOU REPORT IT?

43:39.217 --> 43:41.651
I ACTUALLY DIDN'T KNOW
ABOUT IT AT THE TIME, RICH.

43:41.653 --> 43:43.386
THAT WAS THE HEAD
OF SECURITY'S RESPONSIBILITY.

43:43.388 --> 43:45.855
THE RECENTLY DECEASED
MR. RYAN?

43:45.857 --> 43:47.056
YES.

43:49.393 --> 43:52.929
WHAT THE HELL
IS SHE DOING IN HERE?

43:52.931 --> 43:55.632
JUST ASKING
A FEW QUESTIONS.

43:55.634 --> 43:58.635
- ERIN, I'M SORRY, PLEASE.

43:58.637 --> 44:01.304
I WANNA KNOW
WHY SOMEONE WHO SPENDS

44:01.306 --> 44:04.173
SO MUCH TIME
AT THE LOCAL SHERIFF'S OFFICE

44:04.175 --> 44:06.976
FAILED TO REPORT
A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT CRIME.

44:06.978 --> 44:08.144
DEPUTY,
WATCH WHAT YOU SAY.

44:08.146 --> 44:10.079
A CRIME NOW LINKED
TO FOUR BODIES.

44:10.081 --> 44:11.948
- SHUT YOUR MOUTH.
- IT'S FINE.

44:11.950 --> 44:14.083
NO, IT AIN'T.

44:14.085 --> 44:16.219
NO, IT AIN'T.

44:19.289 --> 44:21.991
MS. WALKER,
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE US.

44:21.993 --> 44:24.394
I'LL BE WITH YOU
OUTSIDE IN A MINUTE.

44:25.896 --> 44:28.965
FOUR BODIES IN ONE DAY.

44:28.967 --> 44:30.933
THAT'S MORE
THAN ALL LAST YEAR.

44:32.436 --> 44:33.870
FOR GOD'S SAKES, SIR.

44:33.872 --> 44:36.706
JED WAS KILLED HERE
LAST NIGHT.

44:39.443 --> 44:43.112
YOU DON'T HAVE TO REMIND ME
ABOUT JED.

44:43.114 --> 44:46.449
I KNOW WHAT'S GOING THROUGH
YOUR MIND RIGHT NOW.

44:46.451 --> 44:47.984
THESE GUYS
RIPPED OFF HER WAREHOUSE

44:47.986 --> 44:51.120
AND SHE DOESN'T REPORT IT?

44:51.122 --> 44:53.356
HER HEAD OF SECURITY
WAS BEATEN TO DEATH

44:53.358 --> 44:55.224
- JUST OUTSIDE OF TOWN.
- RICH,

44:55.226 --> 44:57.260
WE WILL LOOK
INTO THOSE CONNECTIONS.

44:57.262 --> 44:58.728
I WANT TO KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE THINKING

44:58.730 --> 45:00.029
BRINGING HER IN HERE.

45:00.031 --> 45:01.898
IF SHE FILES A LAWSUIT,

45:01.900 --> 45:04.300
IT WON'T BE JUST YOUR ASS
GETTIN' PISSED ON.

45:10.107 --> 45:12.075
DO YOU KNOW
IF IT WAS SOMEBODY ELSE,

45:12.077 --> 45:14.744
-YOU WOULDN'T...
-I AIN'T
SOME HEARTSICK TEENAGER.

45:16.980 --> 45:18.815
I'M DOING MY JOB.

45:20.284 --> 45:23.352
THEN DO IT SMART.

45:23.354 --> 45:24.787
FIND AUSTIN BLUM.

45:27.291 --> 45:30.326
YEAH.

45:30.328 --> 45:31.828
SO, WHAT NOW?

45:33.330 --> 45:34.864
YOU HAVE A CELL PHONE?

45:34.866 --> 45:37.366
- YEAH.
- TAKE IT APART.

45:37.368 --> 45:40.970
SIM CARD, BATTERY.
THROW IT IN THE FIRE.

45:44.441 --> 45:46.809
HOW MANY DAYS
ARE YOU SUPPLIED FOR?

45:46.811 --> 45:50.046
A WEEK, MAYBE,

45:50.048 --> 45:52.982
- BETWEEN THE TWO OF US.
- NAH, I'M LEAVING.

45:52.984 --> 45:55.451
AND YOU'RE COMING WITH ME.

45:55.453 --> 45:58.821
-HUNTER WOULD'VE WANTED IT
THAT WAY.
-HE DID THIS TO HIMSELF.

45:58.823 --> 45:59.956
NOT ME.

46:05.295 --> 46:06.796
THAT'S HIS BLOOD.

46:09.032 --> 46:10.399
YOU WERE INVOLVED IN THIS.

46:10.401 --> 46:13.169
AND BECAUSE OF YOU,
I'M INVOLVED.

46:13.171 --> 46:17.039
NOW, WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY
TO LEAVE

46:17.041 --> 46:18.508
AND WE NEED TO TAKE IT.

46:20.277 --> 46:21.944
BOTH OF US.

46:32.122 --> 46:33.422
SORRY.

46:37.127 --> 46:40.096
MAYBE WE TURN OURSELVES IN
TO THE SHERIFF.

46:41.265 --> 46:44.500
WE DIDN'T KILL NOBODY.

46:44.502 --> 46:46.869
THAT WOMAN, SHE'S...

46:46.871 --> 46:48.204
SHE'S GOT SOME KIND
OF RELATIONSHIP

46:48.206 --> 46:50.473
WITH
THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT.

46:50.475 --> 46:52.141
YOU CAN'T TRUST THEM.

46:57.314 --> 47:00.183
- WHERE ARE WE GONNA RUN TO?
- NOWHERE.

47:00.185 --> 47:02.852
IF WE KEEP MOVING
THEY CAN'T CATCH US.

47:06.123 --> 47:07.590
YOU FOUND ME.

47:17.000 --> 47:18.601
YOU KNOW HOW TO USE
THIS THING?

47:21.205 --> 47:22.271
YEAH.

47:29.580 --> 47:31.247
WATCH OVER THAT CASE.

47:35.152 --> 47:36.619
WHERE'RE YOU GOING?

47:38.589 --> 47:41.557
GOING TO TALK
TO THE COMPANY LADY.

47:41.559 --> 47:43.259
THAT CASE
IS THE ONLY THING

47:43.261 --> 47:46.195
THAT'S GONNA KEEP US
ALIVE.

47:46.197 --> 47:48.464
I'M GONNA MAKE A DEAL.

47:48.466 --> 47:50.366
ARE YOU SURE
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA?

47:52.603 --> 47:54.470
YEAH, I'LL BE CONVINCING.

48:13.291 --> 48:15.958
GOING SOMEWHERE?

48:19.029 --> 48:20.363
WHAT HAPPENED
WITH THE COUSIN?

48:20.365 --> 48:23.032
LET'S JUST SAY
HE'S, UM...

48:25.636 --> 48:27.603
RESOURCEFUL.

48:31.642 --> 48:34.911
YOU WERE HIRED
TO PUT OUT THIS FIRE.

48:37.014 --> 48:39.348
WELL, SOMETIMES YOU'VE GOT
TO THROW DYNAMITE ONTO IT

48:39.350 --> 48:41.317
TO BLOW IT OUT.

48:45.489 --> 48:49.258
I'VE GOT EVERYTHING
UNDER CONTROL.

49:00.504 --> 49:02.204
WHERE'RE YOU GOING?

49:02.206 --> 49:03.506
I...

49:06.143 --> 49:09.478
IT'S THE DEPUTY.
HE ISN'T STUPID.

49:09.480 --> 49:11.013
HE KNOWS
CARROLL'S INVOLVED.

49:11.015 --> 49:14.517
DOES HE NEED TO BE
DEALT WITH?

49:14.519 --> 49:18.154
- I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S...
- YOU KNOW...

49:22.159 --> 49:25.995
THE CLEANUP LIST...

49:25.997 --> 49:31.233
- IS GETTING LONG.
- WELL, THINGS COME UP.

49:32.469 --> 49:34.437
- WE NEED TO BE...
- FLEXIBLE?

49:38.175 --> 49:39.508
YEAH.

49:39.510 --> 49:41.010
THAT'S RIGHT.

49:49.653 --> 49:51.220
YOU...

49:53.156 --> 49:56.659
WILL STAY IN THIS TOWN

49:56.661 --> 50:00.262
UNTIL THE JOB IS DONE.

50:00.264 --> 50:02.398
WHAT ABOUT THE DEPUTY?

50:06.036 --> 50:07.336
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE
TRANSFERRING

50:07.338 --> 50:10.206
TO THE HOME OFFICE
AT THE END OF THE WEEK.

50:12.376 --> 50:14.510
WELL, IT WILL BE DONE
BY THEN.

50:22.352 --> 50:24.186
NOBODY LEAVES.

50:28.759 --> 50:32.128
ANYBODY INVOLVED

50:32.130 --> 50:34.463
IN ANY WAY...

50:36.466 --> 50:39.301
THEY DON'T LEAVE.

50:41.671 --> 50:44.440
WHAT IS THIS STUFF?

50:44.442 --> 50:46.409
PROGRESS.

50:46.411 --> 50:47.743
PROGRESS?

50:47.745 --> 50:49.278
OH,
I'VE HEARD THAT BEFORE.

50:49.280 --> 50:53.149
YEAH, WELL,
PROGRESS COMES WITH A COST.

50:53.151 --> 50:55.818
WHAT IS IT?

50:55.820 --> 50:59.155
I CAN'T TELL YOU
WITH A GUN IN MY CHEST.

51:05.529 --> 51:10.066
IT'S SUPPOSED
TO MAKE PEOPLE BETTER.

51:10.068 --> 51:12.201
AT LEAST
FOR A SHORT TIME.

51:15.439 --> 51:17.306
IT'S A COCKTAIL.

51:17.308 --> 51:19.809
HORMONES,
SYNTHETIC NERVE CONDUCTORS,

51:19.811 --> 51:21.077
NANOTECHNOLOGY.

51:21.079 --> 51:22.645
HONESTLY,

51:22.647 --> 51:25.147
IT'S TOO DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN
TO SOMEONE LIKE YOU.

51:25.149 --> 51:26.849
SOMEONE LIKE ME?

51:26.851 --> 51:30.186
DON'T GET OFFENDED.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT EITHER.

51:30.188 --> 51:31.687
CELL SIZE ROBOTS

51:31.689 --> 51:34.390
THAT CAN REBUILD YOU
AFTER GETTING SHOT TO PIECES.

51:34.392 --> 51:36.258
WHO FIGURES THAT OUT, HUH?

51:36.260 --> 51:37.393
WHY?

51:38.495 --> 51:41.363
IT'S A MILITARY CONTRACT.

51:41.365 --> 51:44.867
- IT'S SUPPOSED TO SAVE LIVES.
- ARE YOU TELLING ME

51:44.869 --> 51:46.635
THAT MY GOVERNMENT
KILLED MY COUSIN?

51:46.637 --> 51:48.804
NO, I'M TELLING YOU
THAT CALE DID.

51:51.642 --> 51:52.708
YOU SEE THAT?

51:54.511 --> 51:56.445
THAT'S
THE ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD

51:56.447 --> 51:57.847
THIS STUFF CREATES.

51:57.849 --> 52:00.683
ANYTHING ELECTRONIC
GETS REAL UNRELIABLE.

52:00.685 --> 52:03.152
WE HAD A HELL OF A TIME
TRYING TO FIX THAT.

52:05.789 --> 52:07.256
AUSTIN.

52:08.692 --> 52:10.826
YOU'RE IN TROUBLE.

52:18.802 --> 52:21.303
AND YOU'RE NOT?

52:21.305 --> 52:24.773
IT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT
KIND OF TROUBLE.

52:24.775 --> 52:27.643
WE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME
TO LONG-TERM TEST THIS STUFF.

52:27.645 --> 52:29.912
AND JUDGING BY CALE,

52:29.914 --> 52:32.448
IT SEEMS LIKE THERE ARE
SOME SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS

52:32.450 --> 52:34.416
TO BRAIN CHEMISTRY, HUH?

52:34.418 --> 52:37.386
THIS STUFF IS GONNA PUT A HOLE
IN YOU.

52:39.556 --> 52:41.423
BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO.

52:43.693 --> 52:46.695
CALE IS THE PROBLEM.

52:46.697 --> 52:49.899
YOU SAID SO YOURSELF.
HE SCARES ME.

52:49.901 --> 52:51.600
AND IF YOU'RE SMART,

52:51.602 --> 52:54.803
- HE SHOULD SCARE YOU, TOO.
- I JUST WANNA SURVIVE.

52:54.805 --> 52:57.173
- OKAY?
- YEAH?

52:57.175 --> 52:58.641
ME, TOO.

53:00.710 --> 53:04.213
LISTEN, CALE...

53:04.215 --> 53:05.881
CALE ISN'T EASY.

53:05.883 --> 53:08.417
I LIKE EASY.

53:08.419 --> 53:10.553
LET'S MAKE THIS EASY
FOR THE BOTH OF US.

53:12.889 --> 53:15.858
YOU BRING ME
THE REMAINING PRODUCT.

53:15.860 --> 53:17.526
I GET YOU
THE HELP YOU NEED.

53:19.696 --> 53:21.730
WHAT ABOUT CALE?

53:23.200 --> 53:25.201
I'LL HANDLE CALE.

53:25.203 --> 53:26.669
MM-HMM.

53:27.837 --> 53:31.373
I CAN SAVE YOU, AUSTIN.

53:31.375 --> 53:34.343
YOU JUST HAVE TO DO
THE RIGHT THING FIRST.

53:40.383 --> 53:43.419
DIAMOND RIDGE.
IT'S NORTH OF TOWN.

53:43.421 --> 53:45.487
YOU MEET ME THERE
TOMORROW MORNING,

53:45.489 --> 53:47.656
AND I'LL GET YOU
THE CASE.

53:47.658 --> 53:48.824
DONE.

53:50.227 --> 53:51.694
MM-HMM.

55:06.736 --> 55:08.604
MORNING, RICH.

55:08.606 --> 55:11.440
PETE. COFFEE?

55:11.442 --> 55:13.976
NAH, I'M GOOD.

55:13.978 --> 55:15.744
HOW'S THE OFFICE?

55:15.746 --> 55:17.513
STILL A SHITSTORM.

55:18.682 --> 55:20.316
YEAH.

55:20.318 --> 55:22.384
BACKGROUND CHECK CAME BACK
ON YOUR PERP, THOUGH.

55:22.386 --> 55:24.720
FIGURED YOU'D WANNA CHECK
IT OUT.

55:24.722 --> 55:28.357
AUSTIN BLUM.
CORPORAL U.S. MARINE CORP.

55:28.359 --> 55:29.892
BEEN AWOL FOR SIX MONTHS.

55:29.894 --> 55:32.761
YEAH, HE TOOK LEAVE
FOR HIS MOM'S FUNERAL,

55:32.763 --> 55:36.365
BUT JUST NEVER CAME BACK.

55:38.401 --> 55:40.436
GOT A COUPLE MISDEMEANORS
FROM WHEN HE WAS A KID,

55:40.438 --> 55:42.104
BUT THAT'S ABOUT IT.

55:42.106 --> 55:43.539
YEAH.

55:45.575 --> 55:46.942
HOW'S THE SHERIFF?

55:46.944 --> 55:51.914
STILL PISSED AS ALL HELL
ABOUT MS. WALKER.

55:51.916 --> 55:53.415
YEAH.

55:55.051 --> 55:57.052
THANKS
FOR BRINGING THIS BY.

55:57.054 --> 55:58.620
YEAH, NO PROBLEM.

55:58.622 --> 56:01.590
ABOUT TO COOK US
SOME TROUT.

56:01.592 --> 56:03.759
- STAY FOR LUNCH?
- NAH, I GOTTA GET BACK.

56:03.761 --> 56:07.796
- BUT THANK YOU, THOUGH.
- I'LL BE IN THIS AFTERNOON.

56:07.798 --> 56:10.666
HEY, DO ME A FAVOR.

56:10.668 --> 56:12.968
GRAB SOME WOOD FOR MY STOVE
BEFORE YOU LEAVE.

56:29.052 --> 56:31.887
A BOMB DETONATED IN BAGDAD
HAS KILLED 17

56:31.889 --> 56:33.822
AND WOUNDED AT LEAST 50.

56:33.824 --> 56:35.524
SECURITY FORCES HAVE BEEN...

56:38.863 --> 56:40.662
THOUGH NO ONE
HAS CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY

56:40.664 --> 56:43.432
FOR THE ATTACK,
THEY HAVE LEADS

56:43.434 --> 56:45.567
AND ARE
FOLLOWING THEM AGGRESSIVELY.

56:51.875 --> 56:53.409
HOW DID IT GO?

56:53.411 --> 56:54.810
WHERE'S THE CASE?

56:57.747 --> 56:59.448
WHAT HAPPENED?

56:59.450 --> 57:01.784
I MET WITH HER
AND SHE WANTS TO MAKE A DEAL.

57:04.053 --> 57:05.988
AND YOU BELIEVE HER?

57:05.990 --> 57:07.756
YES.

57:13.430 --> 57:16.932
PLEASE, I NEED IT.

57:16.934 --> 57:20.102
WHAT KIND OF DEAL
DID YOU MAKE?

57:20.104 --> 57:22.070
JUST GIVE ME THE CASE.

57:24.140 --> 57:25.607
NO.

57:27.911 --> 57:32.080
I AM WAY PAST
FUCKING AROUND HERE RIGHT NOW.

57:37.587 --> 57:39.221
NOT UNTIL YOU TELL ME

57:39.223 --> 57:42.224
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON.

57:42.226 --> 57:43.926
I'M GIVING IT TO ERIN.

57:43.928 --> 57:45.828
OKAY, SO YOU'RE GONNA GIVE IT
TO ERIN.

57:45.830 --> 57:47.095
AND THEN JUST HOPE

57:47.097 --> 57:48.797
THAT EVERYTHING'S
GONNA BE OKAY?

57:48.799 --> 57:50.566
LOOK, YOU DON'T GET
A VOTE IN THIS, ALL RIGHT?

57:50.568 --> 57:52.000
IT'S YOUR DUMB ASS
THAT GOT ME INVOLVED.

57:52.002 --> 57:54.803
IF YOU GO DOWN THERE...

57:54.805 --> 57:57.973
NO ONE
IS GONNA SEE YOU AGAIN.

58:14.057 --> 58:16.158
WHAT?

58:16.160 --> 58:18.160
I'M IN THE AREA.

58:18.162 --> 58:19.895
I'LL LET YOU KNOW.

58:27.137 --> 58:29.071
I DON'T WANNA DIE.

58:58.067 --> 59:01.236
SHE TOLD ME
I HAVE TO KEEP TAKING IT.

59:01.238 --> 59:03.071
OR I'LL DIE.

59:05.575 --> 59:07.242
AND NO,
I DON'T FULLY TRUST HER,

59:07.244 --> 59:09.111
BUT...

59:09.113 --> 59:12.114
I DON'T KNOW WHO ELSE
CAN HELP ME RIGHT NOW.

59:25.695 --> 59:27.162
- IT'S HIM.
- WHAT?

59:27.164 --> 59:30.132
- WE HAVE TO GO.
- HOW'D HE FIND US?

59:30.134 --> 59:32.301
YOU GOT TO TELL ME
WHERE THAT CASE IS.

59:32.303 --> 59:33.969
HE CAN'T FIND IT.

59:54.190 --> 59:55.357
I PUT IT RIGHT OVER HERE.

59:55.359 --> 59:56.725
I PUT IT RIGHT DOWN
OVER HERE,

59:56.727 --> 59:58.293
JUST BELOW THE...

59:58.295 --> 59:59.828
- NO!
- WHAT?

59:59.830 --> 01:00:01.296
NO, NO!
THE ROPE FELL IN.

01:00:01.298 --> 01:00:03.632
- CAN YOU SLIDE DOWN THERE?
- NO WAY.

01:00:03.634 --> 01:00:06.768
OVER THERE.
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

01:00:08.871 --> 01:00:10.706
KEEP TRYING.

01:00:13.943 --> 01:00:16.078
LOWER IT ALL THE WAY
DOWN THERE.

01:00:19.949 --> 01:00:21.116
OKAY.

01:00:21.118 --> 01:00:22.784
- SHIT!
- AGAIN.

01:00:25.655 --> 01:00:27.155
LITTLE RIGHT.

01:00:27.157 --> 01:00:30.826
YEAH, NOW.
SLOW.

01:00:30.828 --> 01:00:32.060
AAH.

01:00:47.810 --> 01:00:49.311
- LET'S GO.
- DID YOU GET IT ALL?

01:00:49.313 --> 01:00:51.146
GOT ENOUGH.
LET'S MOVE, COME ON.

01:01:23.413 --> 01:01:24.980
- SHH!
- WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOIN'?

01:01:24.982 --> 01:01:26.448
- SHH.
- YOU GET BACK IN YOUR HOUSE.

01:01:26.450 --> 01:01:28.050
- YOU STAY QUIET.
- NO, NO.

01:01:29.952 --> 01:01:32.187
HEY! DON'T ANSWER THE DOOR
FOR NOBODY.

01:01:40.730 --> 01:01:43.165
SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT.

01:01:43.167 --> 01:01:44.933
WHOA. WHOA,
WHOA, WHOA.

01:01:44.935 --> 01:01:46.401
SLOW DOWN,
SLOW DOWN, SLOW DOWN.

01:01:49.972 --> 01:01:52.741
ALL RIGHT, WE'LL BE
RIGHT THERE.

01:01:52.743 --> 01:01:54.076
WHAT WAS THAT?

01:01:54.078 --> 01:01:56.745
AUSTIN BLUM
JUST TOOK A FAMILY HOSTAGE.

01:02:08.257 --> 01:02:09.958
GOD DAMN IT.

01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:11.426
YOU THINK HE SAW US?

01:02:35.285 --> 01:02:38.086
COME ON.

01:02:38.088 --> 01:02:40.222
RICH, WHERE THE HELL
ARE YOU GOIN'?

01:02:41.424 --> 01:02:42.991
JUST SPOTTED BLUM.

01:02:42.993 --> 01:02:44.493
WHY DON'T YOU HEAD
TOWARD THE JUNKYARD?

01:02:44.495 --> 01:02:45.994
HEAD TO THE FRONT GATE.

01:03:02.378 --> 01:03:05.113
- DID YOU SEE A MAN COME THROUGH HERE?
- YEAH, THEY WENT THAT WAY.

01:03:05.115 --> 01:03:07.182
- THEY?
- MAN AND A WOMAN.

01:03:11.287 --> 01:03:14.289
TURN YOUR RADIOS OFF.
YOU DON'T WANT TO SPOOK 'EM.

01:03:14.291 --> 01:03:16.291
KEEP A LINE OF SIGHT
WITH EACH OTHER.

01:03:16.293 --> 01:03:18.426
NO ONE
APPROACHES THEM ALONE.

01:03:46.289 --> 01:03:48.123
COME ON.

01:03:52.428 --> 01:03:54.963
- TAKE THE CASE.
- WHAT ABOUT YOU?

01:03:54.965 --> 01:03:57.465
- I'LL BE FINE.
- LIKE HELL YOU WILL.

01:03:57.467 --> 01:04:00.969
IF SOMETHING HAPPENS TO ME
YOU TELL EVERYONE ABOUT THIS.

01:05:24.153 --> 01:05:25.287
RICH?

01:05:26.489 --> 01:05:27.622
RICH?

01:06:09.498 --> 01:06:12.033
CALE.

01:06:29.585 --> 01:06:31.486
- RICH!
- GO AFTER THEM.

01:06:31.488 --> 01:06:33.588
- NOT WITHOUT BACKUP.
- THEY'RE GETTING AWAY!

01:06:33.590 --> 01:06:35.724
YOU SHOULD'VE WAITED
FOR ME.

01:06:48.237 --> 01:06:50.572
THERE WAS ANOTHER MAN
WITH BLUM.

01:06:50.574 --> 01:06:51.639
DID YOU GET A GOOD LOOK?

01:06:51.641 --> 01:06:55.176
NAH. HIS FACE WAS COVERED.

01:06:57.046 --> 01:06:59.214
WHAT THE HELL
ARE WE DOING, SHERIFF?

01:06:59.216 --> 01:07:01.549
BRING ERIN WALKER IN
FOR QUESTIONING.

01:07:01.551 --> 01:07:03.518
WE CAN'T DO THAT.

01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:06.488
YOU BLEW THAT OPTION
WHEN YOU BROUGHT HER
INTO THE STATION.

01:07:09.291 --> 01:07:13.161
WHEN DID YOU TURN INTO
SUCH A COWARD?

01:07:13.163 --> 01:07:16.364
WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE TALKING TO?

01:07:20.503 --> 01:07:22.370
WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON?

01:07:25.674 --> 01:07:26.808
SHERIFF?

01:08:16.526 --> 01:08:18.493
BE WITH YOU
IN JUST A MINUTE.

01:09:06.542 --> 01:09:07.675
RICH.

01:09:14.517 --> 01:09:16.850
I ALMOST GOT KILLED TODAY.

01:09:16.853 --> 01:09:19.520
OH, MY GOD.
I'M SO SORRY.

01:09:21.689 --> 01:09:23.358
ARE YOU?

01:09:30.198 --> 01:09:32.767
PETE'S HURT...

01:09:32.769 --> 01:09:33.935
BUT HE'LL BE FINE.

01:09:37.540 --> 01:09:39.674
JUST THOUGHT
YOU'D LIKE TO KNOW.

01:09:41.710 --> 01:09:43.211
BE CAREFUL.

01:09:45.948 --> 01:09:49.417
THE SUSPECTS
ARE STILL ON THE LOOSE.

01:10:17.713 --> 01:10:19.380
YOU KNOW...

01:10:21.884 --> 01:10:24.219
SHE CALLED ME A FAILURE.

01:10:27.890 --> 01:10:29.557
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

01:10:38.701 --> 01:10:42.837
I... I'M GOOD AT WHAT I DO,
YOU KNOW?

01:10:48.010 --> 01:10:50.912
THING IS,

01:10:50.914 --> 01:10:54.282
PEOPLE LIKE HER
DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW...

01:10:54.284 --> 01:10:57.252
HOW YOU'VE GOT TO THINK
ON THE FLY.

01:11:00.022 --> 01:11:02.890
SOMETHING DOESN'T GO
ACCORDING TO PLAN,

01:11:02.892 --> 01:11:06.261
YOU ACT LIKE A PROFESSIONAL
AND YOU ADJUST.

01:11:09.898 --> 01:11:12.600
WITH HER...

01:11:12.602 --> 01:11:14.302
SOMETHING GOES WRONG

01:11:14.304 --> 01:11:17.438
AND SHE JUST STARTS
POINTING THE FINGERS, BLAMING.

01:11:30.386 --> 01:11:34.022
SHE JUST WANTS
TO SLASH AND BURN.

01:11:36.558 --> 01:11:40.695
BUT SHE DOESN'T KNOW
HOW TO SLASH AND BURN.

01:11:48.404 --> 01:11:51.372
THIS JOB IS STRESSFUL,
YOU KNOW?

01:11:53.909 --> 01:11:56.744
MOST PEOPLE
COULDN'T HANDLE IT, MM-MM.

01:11:59.381 --> 01:12:00.848
BUT I CAN HANDLE IT.

01:12:06.555 --> 01:12:09.390
I SHOW UP TO THE THIRD MARK,
SOMEONE ELSE IS THERE,

01:12:09.392 --> 01:12:10.892
I ADJUST.

01:12:10.894 --> 01:12:13.895
GUY TRIES TO GET AWAY,
I ADJUST.

01:12:13.897 --> 01:12:17.565
LAST MARK TRIES TO BREAK ME,
I WILL NOT ADJUST!

01:12:37.586 --> 01:12:39.354
YOU KNOW...

01:12:40.889 --> 01:12:45.059
WHO HAD IT ALL
FIGURED OUT?

01:12:45.061 --> 01:12:46.894
BRUCE LEE.

01:12:50.566 --> 01:12:54.068
HE SAID,

01:12:54.070 --> 01:12:57.038
"YOU'VE GOT TO BE
SHAPELESS

01:12:57.040 --> 01:12:59.006
LIKE WATER.

01:13:01.710 --> 01:13:05.380
WHEN YOU PUT WATER
INTO A CUP...

01:13:07.583 --> 01:13:10.551
IT BECOMES THE CUP.

01:13:13.422 --> 01:13:16.758
WHEN YOU PUT IT INTO A...

01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:18.926
INTO A TEAPOT,

01:13:18.928 --> 01:13:21.763
IT BECOMES THE TEAPOT.

01:13:27.102 --> 01:13:28.936
WATER CAN FLOW.

01:13:30.406 --> 01:13:32.039
AND IT CAN CRASH."

01:13:50.759 --> 01:13:54.562
BECOME LIKE WATER.

01:14:23.625 --> 01:14:25.460
I DON'T SEE A CASE.

01:14:25.462 --> 01:14:27.762
I DON'T HAVE IT.

01:14:27.764 --> 01:14:30.698
THIS IS DONE.
WE'RE GOING TO THE SHERIFF.

01:14:30.700 --> 01:14:32.700
- WHY WOULD WE DO THAT?
- BECAUSE YOU FUCKED UP.

01:14:32.702 --> 01:14:33.702
I...

01:14:35.103 --> 01:14:37.004
THE ONLY WAY
WE'RE GONNA GET OUT OF THIS

01:14:37.006 --> 01:14:38.573
IS TOGETHER.

01:14:38.575 --> 01:14:40.208
EVEN IF YOU
RUN AWAY WITH THAT CASE,

01:14:40.210 --> 01:14:42.577
HOW MANY DOSES
DO YOU HAVE LEFT?

01:14:42.579 --> 01:14:45.213
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO COME BACK HERE.

01:14:45.215 --> 01:14:46.747
AND WHAT?

01:14:46.749 --> 01:14:48.082
HMM?

01:14:48.084 --> 01:14:50.084
BE LIKE HIM?

01:15:02.064 --> 01:15:03.598
WHAT IS THIS?

01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:06.834
HE HAD IT IN A FILE
WITH THE OTHERS.

01:15:06.836 --> 01:15:07.969
NO.

01:15:10.205 --> 01:15:14.008
HE WAS ALWAYS THE ONLY ONE
LEAVING THIS TOWN ALIVE.

01:15:14.010 --> 01:15:15.676
BUT YOU ALREADY
KNEW THAT.

01:15:25.954 --> 01:15:27.889
I'M GOING
TO THE HOME OFFICE.

01:15:27.891 --> 01:15:29.524
I'M SORRY.

01:15:30.893 --> 01:15:34.295
DON'T.
DON'T DO THAT.

01:15:34.297 --> 01:15:35.763
WHERE'RE YOU GOING?

01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:39.901
I DON'T KNOW.

01:15:47.743 --> 01:15:49.143
COME ON.

01:15:49.145 --> 01:15:51.846
WE'LL GO TO THE SHERIFF
ME AND YOU TOGETHER.

01:15:51.848 --> 01:15:53.548
WE'LL BE PROTECTED.

01:15:53.550 --> 01:15:55.917
HOW PROTECTED WERE YOU
LAST TIME?

01:15:57.786 --> 01:15:59.787
THIS TIME WE KNOW
WHAT'S COMING.

01:16:01.189 --> 01:16:04.559
ARE YOU ASKING ME
TO TURN ON THE COMPANY?

01:16:12.167 --> 01:16:15.269
THE COMPANY
THAT WANTS YOU DEAD.

01:16:15.271 --> 01:16:17.204
YEAH.

01:16:29.585 --> 01:16:31.285
- WHOA!
- NO. WAIT.

01:16:31.287 --> 01:16:34.121
-LET HER GO, SON.
-SHE'S COMING ALONG
PEACEFULLY.

01:16:34.123 --> 01:16:35.656
- ERIN, ARE YOU OKAY?
- I'M FINE.

01:16:35.658 --> 01:16:37.992
JUST WAIT A SECOND.

01:16:37.994 --> 01:16:39.327
ALL UNITS,

01:16:39.329 --> 01:16:40.861
AUSTIN BLUM
IS AT THE CARROLL OFFICE.

01:16:40.863 --> 01:16:43.064
ERIN... SHE CAN EXPLAIN.

01:16:43.066 --> 01:16:44.966
HE IS ARMED
AND HOLDING A HOSTAGE.

01:16:44.968 --> 01:16:47.001
WILLIS,
I'M TURNING MYSELF IN.

01:16:49.271 --> 01:16:51.739
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- CALE.

01:16:51.741 --> 01:16:53.641
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- CARROLL KILLED THOSE PEOPLE.

01:16:53.643 --> 01:16:55.910
AUSTIN HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH IT.

01:16:55.912 --> 01:16:57.345
I'LL EXPLAIN EVERYTHING,
BUT RIGHT NOW

01:16:57.347 --> 01:16:58.879
WE NEED TO GO.

01:16:58.881 --> 01:17:01.182
LISTEN TO HER, SIR.

01:17:01.184 --> 01:17:03.117
LOOKS LIKE
I'M GONNA OWE RICH...

01:18:03.813 --> 01:18:04.979
SHH.

01:18:15.824 --> 01:18:17.224
SHUT THE FUCK UP.

01:19:05.807 --> 01:19:08.109
SHIT, SHIT, SHIT.

01:19:08.111 --> 01:19:10.010
WHAT'RE WE GONNA DO?

01:19:11.046 --> 01:19:13.380
WE NEED TO FIND AN EXIT.

01:19:13.382 --> 01:19:15.516
THE EXITS
ARE ON THE SOUTH SIDE.

01:20:03.131 --> 01:20:04.431
SHH.

01:20:07.836 --> 01:20:09.336
SHH.

01:20:37.399 --> 01:20:39.400
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!

01:20:41.871 --> 01:20:44.305
WHAT?

01:20:44.307 --> 01:20:45.573
WHAT?

01:20:55.116 --> 01:20:57.952
I DID NOT DO THIS.

01:20:59.454 --> 01:21:00.888
LET ME SEE YOUR HANDS.

01:21:00.890 --> 01:21:03.490
SLOW, SLOW!

01:21:03.492 --> 01:21:05.192
BOTH HANDS, BLUM.

01:21:05.194 --> 01:21:07.061
OR ELSE... SHIT!

01:21:19.007 --> 01:21:23.010
WE NEED AN AMBULANCE
AT 4239 DEER SPRING ROAD.

01:21:23.012 --> 01:21:25.379
WE GOT TWO VICS,
OFFICER DOWN.

01:21:31.219 --> 01:21:33.520
SUSPECT AUSTIN BLUM
IS FLEEING THE SCENE.

01:21:42.030 --> 01:21:43.631
AUSTIN BLUM HAS KILLED
A LOT OF PEOPLE

01:21:43.633 --> 01:21:46.000
OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS.

01:21:48.003 --> 01:21:49.403
INCLUDING SHERIFF WILLIS.

01:21:53.475 --> 01:21:57.044
HE HAS BEEN SIGHTED
WITH TWO POSSIBLE ACCOMPLICES.

01:21:57.046 --> 01:21:58.612
A MAN AND A WOMAN.

01:22:01.483 --> 01:22:03.651
WE GOT NO REPORTS
OF STOLEN VEHICLES

01:22:03.653 --> 01:22:05.519
OR MISSING PERSONS,
SO WE CAN ASSUME

01:22:05.521 --> 01:22:06.987
HE'S ON FOOT.

01:22:11.426 --> 01:22:13.961
I WANT TO THANK YOU FOLKS
FOR VOLUNTEERING TO HELP

01:22:13.963 --> 01:22:16.630
PETE AND MYSELF.

01:22:16.632 --> 01:22:20.267
SWEEP THE LOCAL RANCHES.

01:22:20.269 --> 01:22:21.468
A LOT OF PRIVATE PROPERTY

01:22:21.470 --> 01:22:24.071
OUT THERE
FOR AUSTIN TO HIDE IN.

01:22:30.145 --> 01:22:34.148
THIS MAN HAS KILLED
FRIENDS AND FAMILY.

01:22:34.150 --> 01:22:36.617
DO NOT GIVE HIM
ANOTHER CHANCE!

01:22:40.322 --> 01:22:42.489
HEAD ON OUT
TO THE TRUCKS.

01:22:42.491 --> 01:22:44.158
WE ROLL OUT IN FIVE.

01:22:56.504 --> 01:22:58.605
HEY, UH...

01:22:58.607 --> 01:23:00.040
SORRY ABOUT THE WAY

01:23:00.042 --> 01:23:01.508
THINGS ENDED WITH YOU
AND WILLIS.

01:23:04.646 --> 01:23:07.514
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENED
THESE LAST COUPLE DAYS,

01:23:07.516 --> 01:23:11.352
-YOU KNOW HE THOUGHT
THAT YOU WERE A GOOD GUY...
-HEY.

01:23:11.354 --> 01:23:13.287
I'LL, UH...

01:23:15.223 --> 01:23:17.091
MEET YOU
AT THE O'CONNOR RANCH.

01:23:17.093 --> 01:23:18.459
YEAH.

01:23:23.164 --> 01:23:24.331
SEE YOU THERE, SHERIFF.

01:24:03.405 --> 01:24:07.274
I LOVE THE PLACE.

01:24:07.276 --> 01:24:09.543
WHAT NOW?

01:24:09.545 --> 01:24:12.379
THAT ALL DEPENDS
HOW MANY BULLETS YOU GOT.

01:24:19.521 --> 01:24:21.755
SO, WHAT?

01:24:24.059 --> 01:24:26.260
YOU'RE GONNA KILL ME? HMM?

01:24:26.262 --> 01:24:28.562
TRACK DOWN MARY,
THE COPS,

01:24:28.564 --> 01:24:30.330
KILL THEM, TOO?

01:24:30.332 --> 01:24:32.633
- MM-HMM.
- WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?

01:24:32.635 --> 01:24:35.502
I DON'T KNOW.

01:24:35.504 --> 01:24:37.805
I NEVER KNOW
UNTIL I GET THERE.

01:24:39.174 --> 01:24:42.676
BECAUSE EVERY JOB IS...

01:24:42.678 --> 01:24:44.111
THERE'S NO PATTERN.

01:24:48.183 --> 01:24:50.851
YOU BELIEVE IN THEM?

01:24:50.853 --> 01:24:53.287
THE COMPANY,
WHAT THEY DO?

01:24:56.858 --> 01:25:01.295
- I'M JUST TRYING TO SURVIVE.
- ME, TOO.

01:25:07.268 --> 01:25:10.304
HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN? HMM?

01:25:13.341 --> 01:25:15.776
A COUPLE OF DAYS.

01:25:15.778 --> 01:25:18.612
LOOKS LIKE YOU NEED
A LITTLE BIT MORE JUICE.

01:25:20.849 --> 01:25:23.717
YOU WANNA DOSE?

01:25:23.719 --> 01:25:25.152
OH.

01:25:26.354 --> 01:25:27.888
GO ON.

01:25:30.525 --> 01:25:32.392
TAKE IT.

01:25:42.370 --> 01:25:44.671
- I'M CLEAN.
- TSK. AWE.

01:25:47.208 --> 01:25:49.843
THERE'S NO SUCH THING
WITH THIS STUFF.

BECAUSE IF YOU'RE CLEAN,

01:25:55.351 --> 01:25:56.583

IT'S NOT GONNA BE

01:26:59.448 --> 01:27:00.948

WHAT'RE WE GONNA DO?

01:27:03.786 --> 01:27:04.918
