WEBVTT

00:02.915 --> 00:05.353
Hey, did you guys know
this year's the 40th anniversary

00:05.396 --> 00:07.659
of Halloween?Oh, nonsense.

00:07.703 --> 00:09.009
Halloween traditions

00:09.052 --> 00:11.359
date back to the Celtic
festival of Samhain.

00:11.402 --> 00:13.187
Although our current
Halloween customs

00:13.230 --> 00:15.537
come from the evening
before All Hallows' Day--

00:15.580 --> 00:18.583
All Hallows' Eve--
thus, Halloween.

00:18.627 --> 00:20.368
I meant the movie Halloween.

00:20.411 --> 00:22.152
Oh.

00:22.196 --> 00:24.285
Well, that's not
interesting at all.

00:24.328 --> 00:26.113
Did you know the Michael Myers
mask from the film

00:26.156 --> 00:28.550
was actually a Captain Kirk
mask turned inside out?

00:28.593 --> 00:30.856
Okay, now it's interesting.

00:32.075 --> 00:34.164
Are you guys
all dressing up for work?

00:34.208 --> 00:35.296
Of course.
I mean, how often

00:35.339 --> 00:37.167
do you get to wear
costumes to work?

00:37.211 --> 00:40.562
Says the man with a giant
belt buckle and a dickey.

00:40.605 --> 00:44.044
Hey, this is not a costume.
It's a choice. It's a style.

00:44.087 --> 00:46.307
It's a tragedy.

00:46.350 --> 00:48.178
Bernadette, why don't we
get to dress up at work?

00:48.222 --> 00:51.051
We used to, but a couple guys
in the infectious disease lab

00:51.094 --> 00:53.879
went as zombies
and it triggered a quarantine.

00:54.880 --> 00:57.318
The CDC was so mad.

00:57.361 --> 01:01.061
Hey, if you really want to dress
up, we could throw a party.

01:01.104 --> 01:03.063
Oh, that would be fun.

01:03.106 --> 01:04.803
You know, I used to throw
Halloween parties all the time

01:04.847 --> 01:06.283
when I moved into the building.

01:06.327 --> 01:08.677
All the time? I only remember
being invited to one.

01:09.895 --> 01:11.941
Please don't make this
awkward for me.

01:13.421 --> 01:15.510
Okay, so,
Friday night--

01:15.553 --> 01:17.207
Halloween party here.Okay.

01:17.251 --> 01:18.382
Great. Can't wait.

01:18.426 --> 01:19.688
What are you going as?

01:19.731 --> 01:21.211
I don't want
to ruin the surprise.

01:21.255 --> 01:22.734
You'll see it at work.
Just a warning:

01:22.778 --> 01:24.127
it's pretty scary.

01:24.171 --> 01:26.042
Is it a bird?No.

01:26.086 --> 01:27.652
Is it a dog?No.

01:27.696 --> 01:29.089
Oh, I think
I'll be fine, then.

01:34.181 --> 01:36.792
Hello.

01:36.835 --> 01:38.185
Hello.

01:40.012 --> 01:41.579
I see you are dressed
as Doc Brown

01:41.623 --> 01:43.190
from Back to the Future.

01:43.233 --> 01:45.105
May I assume that Amy is going
as his wife, Clara Clayton,

01:45.148 --> 01:47.716
from Back to the Future
Part III?

01:47.759 --> 01:49.326
She is.

02:03.297 --> 02:06.126
Did you do something
different to your hair?

02:07.214 --> 02:09.085
Yes.

02:10.826 --> 02:12.088
Looking good.

02:17.833 --> 02:21.141

02:21.184 --> 02:24.666

02:54.957 --> 02:57.742
Supreme Court Justice
Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

02:57.786 --> 02:59.266
So close.

02:59.309 --> 03:01.616
Kooth Bader Ginsburg.
[chuckles]

03:01.659 --> 03:03.444
The Notorious KBG.

03:03.487 --> 03:05.185
That's very clever.

03:05.228 --> 03:06.838
Sustained.

03:08.231 --> 03:10.494
Are you gonna dress in drag
in front of your fiancée?

03:10.538 --> 03:13.018
Yeah. We have no secrets
from each other.

03:13.062 --> 03:15.543
Well, except for the fact that
I-I crocheted this myself.

03:23.246 --> 03:24.204
Hey, Sheldon.

03:24.247 --> 03:26.467
Hello.Hello.

03:30.253 --> 03:31.559
Oh, my God,

03:31.602 --> 03:33.213
you look amazing.

03:33.256 --> 03:34.649
KOOTHRAPPALI:
I find you guilty of murder,

03:34.692 --> 03:37.260
because you are killing it.

03:37.304 --> 03:38.696
[imitating Sheldon]:
Well, technically,

03:38.740 --> 03:40.698
the Supreme Court wouldn't
determine a defendant's

03:40.742 --> 03:42.265
guilt or innocence
in a criminal matter.

03:42.309 --> 03:44.485
They could only reverse
or revamp a jury's conviction

03:44.528 --> 03:47.227
based on a constitutional
or statutory issue.

03:47.270 --> 03:48.880
[both laughing]

03:50.360 --> 03:51.840
Why are you laughing?

03:52.928 --> 03:54.669
His statement
was factually correct.

03:54.712 --> 03:56.236
[both laughing]

03:56.279 --> 03:58.586
You're sitting in my spot.

03:59.674 --> 04:01.328
You don't have a spot.

04:01.371 --> 04:03.199
What is wrong with you today?KOOTHRAPPALI:
Maybe he's cranky

04:03.243 --> 04:06.115
because he's off
his bathroom schedule.

04:07.595 --> 04:10.380
Well, I can understand how that
would make someone irritable.

04:10.424 --> 04:13.253
Interesting fact: "irritable"
comes from the Latin,

04:13.296 --> 04:15.559
"susceptible to anger."

04:15.603 --> 04:17.300
Just because I used a word

04:17.344 --> 04:18.910
doesn't mean
I want its etymology.

04:18.954 --> 04:20.651
Interesting fact:
"etymology"

04:20.695 --> 04:21.739
comes from the
Greek word...

04:21.783 --> 04:23.785
You are being so annoying.
Stop it.

04:25.003 --> 04:26.918
And why are you two laughing?

04:26.962 --> 04:29.573
[chuckles]Sheldon, he's being you.

04:29.617 --> 04:31.227
He's dressed as you
for Halloween.

04:42.934 --> 04:45.154
Oh.

04:45.197 --> 04:47.069
So you're not
laughing at him.

04:47.112 --> 04:49.245
You're laughing at me.

04:49.289 --> 04:50.768
We're not laughing atyou.

04:50.812 --> 04:51.943
We're laughing withyou.

04:51.987 --> 04:54.468
But I'm not laughing.

04:55.512 --> 04:57.427
Then the first one.

05:00.517 --> 05:01.866
[footsteps approaching]

05:01.910 --> 05:03.868
Ready to go?

05:03.912 --> 05:06.044
Hey, why aren't you
in your costume?

05:06.088 --> 05:07.872
I just didn't feel like it.

05:07.916 --> 05:09.961
You get that I'm wearing
a corset because of you,

05:10.005 --> 05:12.355
not because I'm tired
of breathing?

05:12.399 --> 05:15.967
Amy, do you think I'm
always correcting other people?

05:16.011 --> 05:19.493
No, not all the time.
I mean, just last week,

05:19.536 --> 05:21.233
Penny ended a sentence
with a preposition.

05:21.277 --> 05:24.062
You didn't even mention it.True.

05:24.106 --> 05:27.327
I just waited until I got home
and screamed into a pillow.

05:29.416 --> 05:31.026
Is something bothering you?

05:32.027 --> 05:34.246
Howard dressed up as me
and imitated me,

05:34.290 --> 05:35.683
and everyone laughed.

05:35.726 --> 05:38.990
Oh. Well,
that must have felt terrible.

05:39.034 --> 05:40.949
It did. I never realized

05:40.992 --> 05:43.386
my friends viewed me
as an object of ridicule.

05:43.430 --> 05:45.432
Oh, I don't think that's true.

05:45.475 --> 05:46.911
They laughed, Amy.

05:46.955 --> 05:50.001
In a derisive way.
Not in the instructive way

05:50.045 --> 05:52.526
I laugh at them
when they're being stupid.

05:56.312 --> 05:58.314
Hey, happy Halloween.Oh!

05:58.358 --> 06:00.403
Trick or treat.No.

06:00.447 --> 06:02.710
Sorry, you're not
wearing a costume.

06:02.753 --> 06:06.366
Yeah, I am.
I'm a pharmaceutical sales rep.

06:06.409 --> 06:07.845
I'm gonna need more.

06:07.889 --> 06:11.196
Okay, failed actress
who traded constant rejection

06:11.240 --> 06:14.069
for a Christmas bonus
and a dental plan?

06:14.112 --> 06:16.550
Go nuts.Oh.

06:17.681 --> 06:19.204
I will.

06:19.248 --> 06:21.381
So, what are you
wearing to the party?

06:21.424 --> 06:24.122
Sexy cat? Sexy nurse?
Sexy zombie?

06:24.166 --> 06:25.994
Why do girls' costumes
have to be sexy

06:26.037 --> 06:27.517
but guys' costumes don't?

06:27.561 --> 06:30.694
[scoffs] Say that again
with this helicopter on my head.

06:33.262 --> 06:34.742
Very cute.

06:34.785 --> 06:37.353
Hey, do you remember
what happened

06:37.397 --> 06:39.921
at that first Halloween party
that you invited me to?

06:39.964 --> 06:41.749
When I threw up in the pumpkin?

06:42.793 --> 06:44.752
More memorable than that.

06:44.795 --> 06:48.059
[chuckles]: Really?
That was pretty impressive.

06:48.103 --> 06:50.453
We had our first kiss.

06:50.497 --> 06:52.063
On this very couch.

06:52.107 --> 06:54.065
No, no, our first kiss was
at your birthday.

06:54.109 --> 06:55.415
Remember? I threw you a party,

06:55.458 --> 06:57.329
you didn't make it,
and I felt bad for you.

06:57.373 --> 07:00.637
No, no, it was on Halloween,

07:00.681 --> 07:02.813
and you felt bad for me.

07:02.857 --> 07:04.815
If we're gonna go
through every party

07:04.859 --> 07:07.731
where I felt bad for you,
we're gonna be here awhile.

07:07.775 --> 07:09.472
Never mind.

07:09.516 --> 07:11.866
What? You're not mad
at me, are you?No.

07:11.909 --> 07:13.258
Of course not.
No, we just remember

07:13.302 --> 07:14.434
different things
from that party.

07:14.477 --> 07:15.652
I remember falling in love,

07:15.696 --> 07:17.654
and you remember vomiting
in a pumpkin.

07:17.698 --> 07:19.569
I was, like,
four feet away.

07:19.613 --> 07:21.310
People cheered.

07:23.617 --> 07:25.923
Here you go.Thanks.

07:25.967 --> 07:28.839
So, did you see
Howard's costume?

07:28.883 --> 07:31.320
See it? I made it.
It was hilarious.

07:31.363 --> 07:35.585
Well, Sheldon didn't think so,
and neither did I.

07:35.629 --> 07:37.587
Oh, come on.
It was all in good fun.

07:37.631 --> 07:40.808
Well, I'm sure it was,
but Sheldon's feelings got hurt.

07:40.851 --> 07:43.071
M-Maybe Howard could apologize?

07:43.114 --> 07:44.594
You're kidding, right?

07:44.638 --> 07:46.335
Sheldon didn't apologize

07:46.378 --> 07:49.730
when he said my baby looked
like Winston Churchill.

07:49.773 --> 07:50.948
He loves Churchill.

07:50.992 --> 07:53.603
Your son should take that
as a compliment.

07:53.647 --> 07:55.475
He said it about my daughter.

07:56.563 --> 07:58.869
Well, this isn't about Sheldon.

07:58.913 --> 08:00.958
This is about Howard.

08:01.002 --> 08:02.786
I think it is
about Sheldon.

08:02.830 --> 08:05.659
How many times has he made fun
of Howard for being an engineer?

08:05.702 --> 08:08.052
Going to MIT? His magic?

08:08.096 --> 08:10.359
Sheldon doesn't make fun
of his magic.

08:10.402 --> 08:12.100
Well, he should. It's stupid.

08:14.015 --> 08:15.538
Anyway, the point is,

08:15.582 --> 08:17.801
Sheldon shouldn't dish it out
if he can't take it.

08:17.845 --> 08:20.848
I think the point is
that Howard owes him an apology.

08:20.891 --> 08:22.240
Yeah, well, I think the point is

08:22.284 --> 08:23.546
if Sheldon has a problem
with Howard,

08:23.590 --> 08:25.156
Sheldon should take it up
with him.

08:25.200 --> 08:27.245
HALLEY [over monitor]:
Mama.

08:27.289 --> 08:28.812
Now, if you'll excuse me,

08:28.856 --> 08:31.598
the prime minister of England
needs her diaper changed.

08:35.427 --> 08:37.473
KOOTHRAPPALI:
Hey.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.083
LEONARD: Oh,
that's great.

08:39.127 --> 08:41.346
He's a Supreme Court justice,

08:41.390 --> 08:42.913
and you're the
U.S. Constitution.

08:42.957 --> 08:45.829
Yep. He interprets me.

08:46.743 --> 08:48.571
And guess what's
underneath this?

08:48.615 --> 08:50.225
The Bill of Tights.

08:51.661 --> 08:55.883
Smart, funny, gorgeous--
are we a match or what?

08:55.926 --> 08:58.015
Hey, Bert,
what are you dressed as?

08:58.059 --> 09:00.017
I'll give you a hint.

09:00.061 --> 09:02.106
My work in seismic refraction
measurements and...

09:02.150 --> 09:04.631
Hey, Stuart,
what are you dressed as?

09:04.674 --> 09:06.633
I'm a butterfly.

09:06.676 --> 09:09.331
Did you steal those from
Halley's "let's pretend" box?

09:09.374 --> 09:10.985
I'm gonna put them back.

09:11.986 --> 09:13.814
All right, I'll tell you.

09:13.857 --> 09:17.992
I'm Maurice "Doc" Ewing, winner
of the 1960 Vetlesen Prize,

09:18.035 --> 09:21.212
generally regarded
as the Nobel Prize of geology.

09:21.256 --> 09:23.824
Oh, yeah. Now I see it.

09:23.867 --> 09:25.303
Ask me how I died.

09:25.347 --> 09:27.741
Spoiler alert: brain hemorrhage.

09:28.742 --> 09:30.700
[Cockney accent]:
Well, Gorblimey.

09:30.744 --> 09:32.702
You look
like a thousand tuppence.

09:32.746 --> 09:34.704
Don't he, Mary Poppins?

09:34.748 --> 09:37.664
Are you gonna talk
like that all night?

09:37.707 --> 09:39.100
Jiff willikers, I am.

09:39.143 --> 09:41.276
Isn't he cute?

09:41.319 --> 09:43.844
He's gonna get a
spoonful of sugar later.

09:43.887 --> 09:46.586
And I'm gonna sweep
Ms. Poppins' chimney.

09:46.629 --> 09:49.240
[honks]

09:49.284 --> 09:51.068
So, here we are.

09:51.112 --> 09:54.202
On Halloween.
On this couch.

09:54.245 --> 09:55.856
Does it ring any bells?

09:55.899 --> 09:57.335
Really? We're still doing this?

09:57.379 --> 09:59.947
I'm just surprised you don't
remember our first kiss.

09:59.990 --> 10:02.863
[sighs] Fine.
It was on Halloween.

10:02.906 --> 10:04.342
Are you agreeing
just to shut me up?

10:04.386 --> 10:06.083
You got another way?
I'm all ears.

10:07.650 --> 10:10.435
Really? An arranged marriage?KOOTHRAPPALI:
Yeah.

10:10.479 --> 10:11.611
I know how it sounds.

10:11.654 --> 10:13.700
It sounds awesome.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.267
Is that just an Indian thing,

10:16.311 --> 10:18.095
or can I get a piece of that?

10:20.141 --> 10:22.752
You know the woman
has a choice, right?

10:22.796 --> 10:24.449
There's always a catch.

10:27.322 --> 10:29.324
[imitating Bernadette]:
Happy Halloween.

10:34.764 --> 10:36.636
Who wants to
see a magic trick?

10:36.679 --> 10:38.812
Oh, that's right.
No one.

10:41.510 --> 10:44.687
Ha! They're you.

10:52.521 --> 10:53.914
What do you think you're doing?

10:53.957 --> 10:55.480
I thought it was clear.

10:55.524 --> 10:58.919
I'm being unnecessarily hurtful
but with a sweet voice.

11:00.616 --> 11:02.226
And I don't understand
what's going on

11:02.270 --> 11:04.228
because I went to MIT.

11:05.969 --> 11:07.884
Okay, guys, I think
that's enough.

11:07.928 --> 11:09.712
Hold on. I'm
the judge here,

11:09.756 --> 11:12.715
and I'm going to allow it.

11:12.759 --> 11:13.803
Raj, take a break.

11:13.847 --> 11:14.804
Hey, free speech.

11:14.848 --> 11:16.632
Right back there
somewhere.

11:18.590 --> 11:20.027
WOLOWITZ: You
know what, guys?

11:20.070 --> 11:21.898
You got us. Congratulations.
Now why don't you go back

11:21.942 --> 11:23.683
to your apartment and put
on your other costumes.

11:23.726 --> 11:25.423
Oh, but it's so far away,

11:25.467 --> 11:28.426
and I have such
teeny, tiny legs.

11:28.470 --> 11:31.342
Really? Our bodies?
Is that where we're going, Amy?

11:31.386 --> 11:32.735
[normal voice]:
What's wrong with my body?

11:32.779 --> 11:35.738
Well, for starters,
you have a quarter in your nose.

11:40.569 --> 11:42.702
AMY:
Not now, Sheldon.

11:42.745 --> 11:44.921
I don't get invited
to a lot of parties.

11:44.965 --> 11:46.444
Is this a good one?

11:46.488 --> 11:48.620
Oh, yeah.

11:57.499 --> 12:00.894
Did that guacamole
taste weird to you?

12:03.897 --> 12:06.160
Tasted weird to me.

12:07.161 --> 12:09.337
Can't believe Amy did that.

12:09.380 --> 12:10.947
Oh, come on.
You thought it was funny

12:10.991 --> 12:12.340
when I dressed up as Sheldon.

12:12.383 --> 12:13.820
That was totally different.

12:13.863 --> 12:16.213
How?That didn't hurt my feelings.

12:16.257 --> 12:19.695
Well, for what it's worth,

12:19.739 --> 12:21.915
I didn't think it was
a very good impression of you.

12:21.958 --> 12:24.831
Really? You don't think I have
an annoying high-pitched voice?

12:24.874 --> 12:26.180
No, not at all.

12:26.223 --> 12:30.401
In fact, I find your voice
quite melodious.

12:30.445 --> 12:32.316
Mm-hmm. And you don't think

12:32.360 --> 12:34.797
I'm unnecessarily hurtful?

12:35.842 --> 12:37.278
What? I'm sorry.

12:37.321 --> 12:40.194
I-I couldn't hear the question.
I just heard the music.

12:44.589 --> 12:47.201
Well, people came,
they ate, they vowed

12:47.244 --> 12:48.506
to never speak
to each other again.

12:48.550 --> 12:51.074
I think it was
a successful party.

12:51.118 --> 12:53.816
It was.
And I'm sorry about earlier.

12:53.860 --> 12:55.209
I know it doesn't matter.

12:55.252 --> 12:58.299
[sighs] No, it does matter.

12:58.342 --> 12:59.822
Okay? You were right.

12:59.866 --> 13:01.171
It was Halloween.

13:01.215 --> 13:03.652
I was dressed as a cat,
you were a hobbit.

13:03.695 --> 13:06.002
It was right there
on that couch.

13:06.046 --> 13:08.570
Why didn't you just say that?

13:08.613 --> 13:11.355
Because I always hated
that was our first kiss.

13:11.399 --> 13:13.357
I was drunk, and I
was still with Kurt,

13:13.401 --> 13:15.751
and I was using you to
make myself feel better.

13:15.795 --> 13:18.449
I... just wanted our first
kiss to mean something.

13:18.493 --> 13:20.582
That's why I said it was
the one on your birthday.

13:21.583 --> 13:24.238
I like that.

13:24.281 --> 13:27.023
We'll make that
our official first kiss.

13:27.067 --> 13:31.071
Thank you. Aw.
[giggles]

13:32.072 --> 13:33.421
That was beautiful.

13:36.728 --> 13:39.209
Mm.What are you still doing here?

13:39.253 --> 13:40.950
I was in the bathroom.

13:40.994 --> 13:43.561
Guacamole didn't agree with me.

13:43.605 --> 13:45.868
Well, since you're here,
you can help us clean up.

13:45.912 --> 13:47.870
Will you take this out, please?Sure.

13:47.914 --> 13:49.306
Thank you.

13:49.350 --> 13:52.875
It's late. Would you mind
if I crashed here tonight?

13:52.919 --> 13:54.181
You are always welcome here.

13:54.224 --> 13:56.661
Thank you.Mm-hmm.

14:02.929 --> 14:03.973
Where were we?

14:06.933 --> 14:10.153
I think Howard hurting
my feelings has in some ways

14:10.197 --> 14:11.589
made me a better person.

14:11.633 --> 14:13.809
Hmm. Look at you,
improving on perfection.

14:13.853 --> 14:15.680
How so?

14:15.724 --> 14:16.986
As you were eating that Danish,

14:17.030 --> 14:19.336
I wanted to point out
that the Danish

14:19.380 --> 14:20.598
isn't Danish at all.

14:20.642 --> 14:22.296
It was imported
by Austrian bakers

14:22.339 --> 14:23.775
during a labor dispute
in the 1800s.

14:23.819 --> 14:26.213
But I chose not to,

14:26.256 --> 14:27.997
because I didn't want to be
the kind of fella

14:28.041 --> 14:30.521
who foists unwanted facts
about European pastries

14:30.565 --> 14:32.741
on the unwilling.

14:32.784 --> 14:34.917
Huh. That's actually
interesting.

14:34.961 --> 14:37.615
Sorry. Now you'll never know.

14:37.659 --> 14:39.574
Hey, guys, I need your help.

14:39.617 --> 14:41.489
[chuckles]:
Bernadette's still pretty upset

14:41.532 --> 14:43.012
about your costumes.

14:43.056 --> 14:44.492
She'supset?

14:44.535 --> 14:46.755
Those pants I wore to make fun
of you were so tight,

14:46.798 --> 14:48.931
I risked a testicular hernia.

14:48.975 --> 14:50.933
Anyway,

14:50.977 --> 14:54.023
if you guys could apologize,
it'd be a big help.

14:54.067 --> 14:56.460
Oh, we'd be happy
to apologize to her

14:56.504 --> 14:58.201
as soon as she apologizes to me

14:58.245 --> 15:00.377
for not making you apologize
to Sheldon.

15:00.421 --> 15:01.639
I didn't follow that,

15:01.683 --> 15:03.163
but, then, between my wife
and that guacamole,

15:03.206 --> 15:05.600
I didn't get a lot
of sleep last night.

15:05.643 --> 15:07.297
Don't you think
it's unreasonable

15:07.341 --> 15:10.213
for her to ask us to do
something she refused to do?

15:10.257 --> 15:13.086
Yes. So when can you
stop by? [chuckles]

15:13.129 --> 15:14.652
I don't understand.
If it's unreasonable,

15:14.696 --> 15:16.045
why should we do it?

15:16.089 --> 15:17.612
Okay, how about this?
You know in Star Wars

15:17.655 --> 15:20.223
when R2 and Chewbacca
were playing holochess?

15:20.267 --> 15:21.833
Really? Star Wars?

15:21.877 --> 15:24.401
Amy, let the man speak.

15:24.445 --> 15:26.142
WOLOWITZ:
Well, Chewbacca

15:26.186 --> 15:28.971
was losing
and getting angry and...

15:29.015 --> 15:32.627
W-W-Wait. Are you saying
we should let the Wookiee win?

15:32.670 --> 15:33.976
[chuckles]:
Hey.

15:34.020 --> 15:36.457
Hey, that's my wife
you're talking about.

15:38.372 --> 15:40.940
[whispers]:
But yes, let the Wookiee win.

15:46.989 --> 15:49.165
Hello, Bernadette.

15:49.209 --> 15:51.820
Wait, did you just walk
into my house?

15:51.863 --> 15:53.996
No, Howard let me in.

15:54.040 --> 15:55.128
Where is he?

15:55.171 --> 15:58.087
Oh, he got in his car
and drove away.

15:59.219 --> 16:00.611
Oh.

16:00.655 --> 16:02.396
Is that watermelon
for anybody?

16:02.439 --> 16:05.225
It's for Halley.Is she gonna eat all of it?

16:05.268 --> 16:06.922
God, no wonder
she looks like Churchill.

16:08.968 --> 16:11.057
What do you want, Sheldon?

16:11.100 --> 16:13.407
Howard said
your feelings were hurt.

16:13.450 --> 16:14.843
Well, Howard's wrong.
I don't care

16:14.886 --> 16:16.192
if someone makes fun of me.

16:16.236 --> 16:18.542
All right.

16:18.586 --> 16:21.241
Apparently I came
all this way for nothing.

16:21.284 --> 16:24.592
Unless Halley wants to share
that watermelon?

16:24.635 --> 16:26.550
You think Amy's the first person
to make fun of me

16:26.594 --> 16:27.987
for having a squeaky voice?

16:28.683 --> 16:30.206
Do you?

16:30.250 --> 16:32.034
I feel like my chance
at watermelon

16:32.078 --> 16:34.297
is dangling by a thread.

16:34.341 --> 16:36.560
She's not. It's been happening
my whole life.

16:36.604 --> 16:38.954
And-and she called me out
for being mean?

16:38.998 --> 16:40.956
Well, I've had to be mean.

16:43.089 --> 16:45.047
It's hard to be taken seriously

16:45.091 --> 16:47.267
when you're always
the smallest person in the room.

16:47.310 --> 16:48.616
I know that.

16:48.659 --> 16:50.748
I was in high school
when I was nine years old.

16:50.792 --> 16:52.446
I tried to tell
the other kids

16:52.489 --> 16:54.491
that although
my physical stature was small,

16:54.535 --> 16:56.754
my intellectual stature
towered over them.

16:56.798 --> 17:00.976
That only seemed
to make things worse.

17:01.020 --> 17:04.762
The kids called me
Bernadette the marionette.

17:04.806 --> 17:07.330
[laughs]: Because you're small.
That's funny.

17:08.375 --> 17:09.680
No, it's not.

17:09.724 --> 17:12.814
Well, people used
to call me egghead

17:12.857 --> 17:14.772
'cause there were eggs
on my head.

17:14.816 --> 17:16.818
'Cause they threw them at me.

17:16.861 --> 17:18.341
That's terrible.

17:19.473 --> 17:21.562
One time my brothers
made me breathe helium.

17:21.605 --> 17:23.129
I tried to call for help,

17:23.172 --> 17:26.001
but the only one
who could hear me was the dog.

17:28.047 --> 17:30.962
That's also terrible.

17:31.006 --> 17:33.661
My goodness, you had to live
in a house with a dog.

17:33.704 --> 17:38.231
I guess we both had to put up
with a lot of crap from people.

17:38.274 --> 17:41.408
I suppose we have. Huh.

17:41.451 --> 17:43.845
Maybe you and I are more alike
than we thought.

17:43.888 --> 17:45.673
Maybe we are.

17:45.716 --> 17:48.415
Although I'm exceptionally tall,
and you're exceptionally...

17:48.458 --> 17:50.852
Sheldon.You didn't even let me finish.

17:50.895 --> 17:52.984
Fine. Sorry.Short.

18:01.471 --> 18:03.212
Sheldon, you sure
you're ready for this?

18:03.256 --> 18:05.345
This movie's pretty scary.Please.

18:05.388 --> 18:07.216
I'm an adult.
I think I can handle it.

18:07.260 --> 18:10.785
That's what you said about the
butterfly pavilion at the zoo.

18:10.828 --> 18:13.135
That was my fault.
After I pet that goat,

18:13.179 --> 18:15.529
I felt like a gladiator.

18:15.572 --> 18:17.008
Okay, lights on, or lights off?

18:17.052 --> 18:20.882
Lights off. If I'm gonna
do this, I want to do it right.

18:20.925 --> 18:23.276
[Halloweentheme playing]

18:26.148 --> 18:28.107
What do you guys think
you're doing?

18:28.150 --> 18:29.804
We're showing
Sheldon Halloween.

18:29.847 --> 18:31.936
Absolutely not.
Sheldon, come home.

18:31.980 --> 18:33.895
[stammers]

18:33.938 --> 18:36.115
But I really want
to watch it.

18:36.158 --> 18:38.465
I know you do,
but I am forbidding it.

18:38.508 --> 18:40.510
Oh, man. Sorry, guys.

18:45.124 --> 18:46.951
What took you so long?I'm sorry. I just
got your text!
