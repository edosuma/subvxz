00:05.092 --> 00:08.138
Josh, it's not about checking
a box and getting a fancy label

00:08.182 --> 00:09.531
for what's
bothering you.

00:09.574 --> 00:10.662
Look within.

00:10.706 --> 00:12.490
REBECCA:
I still love you, Nathaniel,

00:12.534 --> 00:14.101
but I meant what I said
in the courtroom.

00:14.144 --> 00:15.798
You know? About being a better
person-- I want to do that.

00:15.841 --> 00:17.452
Can you stop overthinking
everything?

00:17.495 --> 00:19.541
Okay, I'm not
overthinking things.

00:19.584 --> 00:21.412
I'm trying to be a good person.Really?

00:21.456 --> 00:23.632
Because from where I'm sitting,
every time we're happy,

00:23.675 --> 00:25.199
you try to ruin it.

00:25.242 --> 00:26.548
I don't know how
insurance works.

00:26.591 --> 00:27.984
Me neither.

00:28.028 --> 00:30.334
We can figure
those things out.

00:30.378 --> 00:32.075
Me and you.

00:32.119 --> 00:33.685
We'd like to offer
you the position

00:33.729 --> 00:34.904
of junior partner.

00:34.947 --> 00:36.384
REBECCA:
This is objectively

00:36.427 --> 00:38.342
fantastic, right? Wow.

00:38.386 --> 00:39.691
Wow, wow, wow, wow.

00:39.735 --> 00:42.477
Wow. I am sorry,
I just need to get a smoothie.

00:42.520 --> 00:44.435
I didn't have any breakfast,
and I-I get weird

00:44.479 --> 00:46.133
Where are
you going?when I don't have protein.

00:46.176 --> 00:47.699
I'm just... I was going to...

00:47.743 --> 00:50.006
I'm just going
to the deli on Broadway.

00:50.050 --> 00:52.269
You like to work? That's
the first I've heard of it.

00:52.313 --> 00:54.271
Uh, I got a hop off. I'm really
working hard here. Bye.

00:54.315 --> 00:55.838
So, I cannot be here today,

00:55.881 --> 00:58.058
but let's reconnect tomorrow
and get to know each other.

00:58.101 --> 01:00.321
Can we get back to work,
or am I boring you?

01:00.364 --> 01:01.974
Let's just do this
stupid meeting

01:02.018 --> 01:04.020
with these stupid clients!

Hey, Rebecca. Hey.

01:47.629 --> 01:48.934
How'd it go?

01:48.978 --> 01:51.415
A bar association
is no joke, man.

01:51.459 --> 01:54.592
It's a long line of
identical-looking old white men,

01:54.636 --> 01:56.942
all with this look
on their face.

01:56.986 --> 01:58.553
Okay, so, what did they say?

01:58.596 --> 02:00.685
Well, they said, "Uh, thank you
for your answers, Miss Bunch.

02:00.729 --> 02:03.035
"We will review your case
and notify you next week

02:03.079 --> 02:04.385
"via a registered letter about

02:04.428 --> 02:06.300
whether you can still
practice law."

02:06.343 --> 02:07.562
Oh, I'm not worried.

02:07.605 --> 02:09.564
Look, they won't
disbar you.

02:09.607 --> 02:11.435
The criminal charges
against you were dropped.

02:11.479 --> 02:13.307
That hearing was
just a formality.

02:13.350 --> 02:16.266
You think?Yeah. I'm sure.
In the meantime,

02:16.310 --> 02:17.746
you have got to come
back to Whitefeather.

02:17.789 --> 02:20.488
I mean...
MountainTop.

02:20.531 --> 02:22.881
My God, that name
is such a barf.

02:22.925 --> 02:25.101
Bert's a kook.
Tim's an idiot.

02:25.145 --> 02:26.624
Darryl's still on
paternity leave.

02:26.668 --> 02:28.322
Jim has disappeared,
like, poof.

02:28.365 --> 02:30.324
And Nathaniel is just
stomping around the office

02:30.367 --> 02:31.586
like a sad, handsome baby.

02:31.629 --> 02:33.675
Rebecca, we really
need you at work.

02:33.718 --> 02:36.330
AKOPIAN: Do you want to go back to work?

02:36.373 --> 02:37.983
Yeah, I do.

02:38.027 --> 02:39.724
I'm great at it.
Plus, I had

02:39.768 --> 02:42.379
a tapeworm in jail, so...
I'm looking pretty fit.

02:42.423 --> 02:43.815
So, yeah, yeah, I'm ready.

02:43.859 --> 02:45.339
I'm gonna walk
in that building,

02:45.382 --> 02:46.601
go to the coffee shop
in the lobby

02:46.644 --> 02:48.559
and tell Martin to fire up

02:48.603 --> 02:52.302
my usual supersweet latte with
extra soy foam for my tapeworm.

02:52.346 --> 02:53.695
Okay.

02:53.738 --> 02:55.523
Because you know you
don't have to be a lawyer.

02:55.566 --> 02:58.265
There are other fields.

02:58.308 --> 03:00.136
Other fields?
Nah, I think the ship sailed

03:00.180 --> 03:01.572
on that a long time ago.

03:01.616 --> 03:04.184
I just want you to be mindful

03:04.227 --> 03:07.535
about what makes you
truly happy.Got it.

03:07.578 --> 03:10.407
It's a good note, it's a good
note. I will keep that in mind

03:10.451 --> 03:12.583
as I go back to the only thing

03:12.627 --> 03:15.630
anyone has ever paid me
or valued me for.

03:23.812 --> 03:25.205
Josh?

03:26.467 --> 03:27.685
Hey, Rebecca.

03:27.729 --> 03:29.383
Hey.
What are you doing here?

03:29.426 --> 03:30.732
Well, I'm in therapy.

03:31.776 --> 03:32.777
Wait.

03:32.821 --> 03:34.605
Josh Chan is in therapy?

03:34.649 --> 03:35.737
Double wait.

03:35.780 --> 03:37.304
You go to my shrink?

03:37.347 --> 03:39.393
Oh, I-I go to her
husband, Davit.

03:39.436 --> 03:41.395
He has better Yelp
reviews, actually.

03:41.438 --> 03:42.918
Oh, that's on me.

03:42.961 --> 03:45.486
I left some bad reviews on her
when I was spiraling.

03:45.529 --> 03:47.705
A lot of fake accounts.
It was a dark time.Oh.

03:47.749 --> 03:48.880
I should delete those.

03:48.924 --> 03:50.578
Yeah. Maybe.Anyway, um...

03:50.621 --> 03:52.710
Oh, my God.
Good for you.

03:52.754 --> 03:54.582
Josh Chan in therapy.

03:54.625 --> 03:56.584
Gettin' deep.

03:56.627 --> 03:58.281
Um...

03:58.325 --> 04:00.849
Actually, do you have a...
do you have a s

04:00.892 --> 04:03.721
Yeah, please.You probably know this,
but I've been trying

04:03.765 --> 04:06.637
to take responsibility
for things, and...

04:06.681 --> 04:08.248
I've been trying to find

04:08.291 --> 04:11.686
the right time
to tell you that...

04:11.729 --> 04:14.123
what I've done to you
the last couple of years

04:14.166 --> 04:16.256
is... awful.

04:16.299 --> 04:18.606
It's some of the worst stuff
I've ever done to anyone.

04:18.649 --> 04:20.390
It was stalking.
It's inexcusable.

04:20.434 --> 04:22.218
And if I'd been a man,

04:22.262 --> 04:24.089
I would have been in jail
a lot sooner.

04:24.133 --> 04:26.309
I-I appreciate you
saying that, Becks.

04:26.353 --> 04:28.790
Um, I've been meaning
to talk to you

04:28.833 --> 04:30.879
about some of the
things I did, also.

04:30.922 --> 04:32.228
Hmm?

04:32.272 --> 04:33.882
Like, when I
moved in with you

04:33.925 --> 04:36.711
but acted like
we were casual...

04:36.754 --> 04:38.278
that was gaslighting.

04:39.757 --> 04:42.194
You know what?
We both made mistakes.

04:42.238 --> 04:43.805
What matters is
you're getting support now.

04:43.848 --> 04:45.676
And I'm so happy for you.Yeah.

04:45.720 --> 04:49.027
I am. And-and, uh, you know, I'm
also learning to look within,

04:49.071 --> 04:51.291
understand my emotions.

04:51.334 --> 04:53.336
Um, I-I recently

04:53.380 --> 04:55.599
made a big decision.

04:55.643 --> 04:57.427
Are you finally moving out
of Hector's mom's house?

04:57.471 --> 04:58.820
No. She's awesome.

04:59.908 --> 05:01.997
I'm starting to date.

05:02.040 --> 05:04.478
Oh.I'm gonna go
on the apps.

05:04.521 --> 05:05.609
Oh.

05:05.653 --> 05:07.959
I'm looking for a
real relationship.

05:09.352 --> 05:10.745
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

05:10.788 --> 05:13.182
I... Should I have
told you that?

05:13.225 --> 05:14.923
Is that weird?Oh, my God. No.

05:14.966 --> 05:16.620
Not weird at all.

05:16.664 --> 05:18.709
In fact, I'm gonna need
the deets on that.

05:18.753 --> 05:21.146
No. Because there's
going to be

05:21.190 --> 05:22.670
a feeding frenzy
in the Cov.

05:22.713 --> 05:24.628
Don't. Oh, my God.Josh Chan's on the apps?

05:24.672 --> 05:27.370
Like, people's brains
are gonna explode.

05:34.421 --> 05:36.292
Hey. Like, no judgment,
like, at all,

05:36.336 --> 05:39.556
but why is your shoe off in
my public eating establishment?

05:39.600 --> 05:41.123
My shoe hurts.Mm.

05:41.166 --> 05:43.038
I smashed my toe
surfing Little Dume,

05:43.081 --> 05:44.431
and now look.

05:44.474 --> 05:46.346
Got a big hole in my toe.

05:46.389 --> 05:48.130
Uh, that's really gross.

05:48.173 --> 05:50.262
You need to call your doctor,
like, right now.

05:50.306 --> 05:52.787
No, I'm fine.No, baby, call him.

05:52.830 --> 05:54.789
I don't want baby
to lose a toe.

05:54.832 --> 05:57.052
I love baby's toes.

05:57.095 --> 05:59.054
And baby's hairless arms.

05:59.097 --> 06:00.795
And baby.

06:00.838 --> 06:01.883
Aw.

06:01.926 --> 06:03.885
I love you, too,
kitty cat.

Hi.

06:34.219 --> 06:35.699
What is this place?

06:35.743 --> 06:37.875
It's a 1920s speakeasy.

06:39.311 --> 06:42.053
No, it's not. It's a
corporately-owned pretzel store.

06:42.097 --> 06:44.012
That just appeared in my lobby?Hey, wait.

06:44.055 --> 06:45.796
You look familiar.
Why is that?

06:45.840 --> 06:47.450
I...

06:47.494 --> 06:49.670
Jim? Jim, What are
you doing down here?

06:49.713 --> 06:51.019
I own this place.

No, you don't.
You're a lawyer, like me.

He's a lawyer,
like me.Not anymore. I quit the law.

06:55.458 --> 06:57.547
What? You...
No, no, you can't do that.

06:57.591 --> 06:58.940
I can and I did.

06:58.983 --> 07:00.420
I got sick of it.

07:00.463 --> 07:02.726
Plus, uh, Pretzel Central
was recruiting branch owners,

07:02.770 --> 07:05.468
and the coffee shop that was
here closed, so here I am.

07:05.512 --> 07:07.339

all that time
studying for the bar,

all that time taking the bar...I know the process
to become a lawyer--

07:15.652 --> 07:17.437
I just don't want to do
it anymore. It sucks.

07:18.960 --> 07:20.657
It's dumb

no, no.

07:24.356 --> 07:26.750
Bad idea. Trust me.

Being a lawyer is...

10:18.313 --> 10:19.923
perfectly fine.

10:19.967 --> 10:22.926

10:48.778 --> 10:50.345
Mmm.

10:50.388 --> 10:53.261
Hi, everyone. I'm back.BERT:
Hello, Rebecca.

10:53.304 --> 10:55.263
Glad you're not locked
in the slammer anymore.Mmm.

10:55.306 --> 10:57.831
I wanted to let you know about
a few changes around here...

10:57.874 --> 11:00.355
Oh, don't worry.
Paula filled me in.

11:00.398 --> 11:02.923
Uh, it's called MountainTop now.
Cool sign, bruh.

11:02.966 --> 11:04.185
Thank you.

11:04.228 --> 11:06.666
Hi, Nathaniel.

11:08.102 --> 11:11.845
BERT:
Oh, that's his sad baby walk.

11:11.888 --> 11:13.629
Oh, boy.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.631
He hates Bert.

11:15.675 --> 11:17.851
What?And then he found out
you were coming back

11:17.894 --> 11:20.201
and went on, like,
a silent strike

11:20.244 --> 11:22.725
and is all upset
'cause no one cares.

11:22.769 --> 11:24.553
It's adorable.

11:28.165 --> 11:30.777
He got blinds just
for that moment.

11:30.820 --> 11:32.387
Mm.

11:32.430 --> 11:33.954
He did great.

11:33.997 --> 11:35.129
Yeah.

11:35.172 --> 11:38.132
Okay, Wendy LeGrand
is first up today.

11:38.175 --> 11:40.047
She has been asking and asking
when you're coming back.

11:40.090 --> 11:42.005
And since she is
our biggest client,

11:42.049 --> 11:45.269
it has been so hard
stalling her.

11:45.313 --> 11:47.010
Don't worry, 'cause
I'm back now, 'kay?

11:47.054 --> 11:48.316
Come on. Let's do this.

11:48.359 --> 11:49.143
Okay.

11:49.186 --> 11:51.101
Yeah.

11:51.145 --> 11:53.756
Rebecca, your absence
was certainly felt around here.

11:53.800 --> 11:56.106
While you were out,
Tim handled my account.

11:56.150 --> 11:58.892
As you can imagine, there were
significant oversights.

11:58.935 --> 12:01.895
I told you that the reason
I missed that zoning meeting

12:01.938 --> 12:04.506
is because I used to
share a watch with Jim,

12:04.549 --> 12:05.812
but he's no longer here...

12:05.855 --> 12:07.422
Shh...Ah.

12:07.465 --> 12:09.816
Well, the good news is that
you don't need Tim anymore,

12:09.859 --> 12:13.167
because, uh,
Bunch is back, bitches!

12:14.995 --> 12:16.605
I'm not bitches.

12:16.648 --> 12:19.608
I'm one bitch. A bitch who wants
her business handled correctly.

12:19.651 --> 12:21.175
Wendy, you're absolutely right.

12:21.218 --> 12:23.264
So, I took a look
at those zoning issues.

12:23.307 --> 12:25.353
And, first of all, I have
to say, the city council's

12:25.396 --> 12:28.095
conservation easement is, like,
one of the funniest things

12:28.138 --> 12:30.271
I've ever seen
in my entire life.

12:30.314 --> 12:32.099
Well, what do we do about
the open space bylaws?

12:32.142 --> 12:34.057
REBECCA:
Bylaws? More like bye-bye, laws,

12:34.101 --> 12:36.407
because we're gonna exploit
all the loopholes like crazy.

12:36.451 --> 12:38.670
Um, in summation,
loop, there it is.

12:41.238 --> 12:43.066
Yeah. There she is.: Yeah, that's...

12:43.110 --> 12:44.067
Don't throw it out
in here.

12:44.111 --> 12:45.590
It's a zucchini shake.

12:45.634 --> 12:47.070
It'll smell.

12:47.114 --> 12:48.855
Okay.

12:49.899 --> 12:51.858
I'm so sorry about him.

12:51.901 --> 12:54.817
Um, Wendy, I'm here for you now.
You don't have to worry anymore.

12:54.861 --> 12:56.732
This is what I do.
It's what I'm good at.

12:58.473 --> 13:02.259
Oh, my God, Rebecca, you
handled that meeting so well.

13:02.303 --> 13:05.088
Oh, it's so great
to have you back.

13:05.132 --> 13:06.394
It's like you never left.

13:06.437 --> 13:08.831
You just got right back
in the swing of things.

13:08.875 --> 13:10.180
I knew you would.

13:10.224 --> 13:11.834
Thank you.

13:13.488 --> 13:15.272
Yeah.

13:15.316 --> 13:17.927
I mean, I'm back at work,
and I'm already...

13:17.971 --> 13:19.450
crushin' it.

13:19.494 --> 13:21.191
Wow.

13:21.235 --> 13:23.280
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.

13:23.324 --> 13:25.630
This is great. Wow, wow.

13:25.674 --> 13:28.285
This is fantastic. Right?

13:28.329 --> 13:29.199
I know.

13:29.243 --> 13:30.200
It's objectively f...

13:30.244 --> 13:31.636
this is objectively fantastic.

13:31.680 --> 13:34.030
Like, on paper,
fantastic, right?

13:34.074 --> 13:37.294
Wow. Wow, wow,
wow, wow, wow.

13:37.338 --> 13:38.600
Rebecca?

13:38.643 --> 13:39.906
I'm sorry.

13:39.949 --> 13:42.952
I just need
to go get a smoothie.

13:42.996 --> 13:44.345
I didn't eat
breakfast,

13:44.388 --> 13:47.827
and I get... I get weird
when I don't have protein.

13:47.870 --> 13:51.221
So, I'm just gonna go grab
something to eat.

13:54.268 --> 13:56.183
Hey. Are you hiring?

14:02.319 --> 14:03.799
So, do you, like,
still dance hip

14:03.843 --> 14:06.062
You were so amazing
in high school.

14:06.106 --> 14:07.890
You did that one Usher medley.
Oh, my God, Yeah.

14:07.934 --> 14:09.196
I still think about it.
Really?

14:09.239 --> 14:12.199
Like, a lot.

14:12.242 --> 14:13.635
I-I dance sometimes.

14:13.678 --> 14:16.290
For a while, I was a
go-go dancer at Aluminum.

14:16.333 --> 14:17.769
Like, the gay bar?

14:17.813 --> 14:18.858
Yeah.Hmm.

14:18.901 --> 14:19.859
That's cool.
I've been to, like,

14:19.902 --> 14:21.338
eight bachelorettes there.

14:21.382 --> 14:22.862
That was after I left
the priesthood

14:22.905 --> 14:24.776
and before I started
living with Hector's mom.

14:24.820 --> 14:28.693
Sorry, Hector's... mom?Uh-huh.

14:28.737 --> 14:31.087
Do you guys, like, hook up?

14:31.131 --> 14:32.480
What? No.

14:32.523 --> 14:34.699
We're just roommates.
Although my therapist says

14:34.743 --> 14:37.354
she might be fulfilling
a larger role in my life.Okay,

14:37.398 --> 14:40.880
wait, Josh Chan is in therapy?
I mean, I knew you dated that

14:40.923 --> 14:42.794
crazy girl, but I didn't know
that youmight be crazy, too.

14:42.838 --> 14:44.318
Oh, my God.

14:44.361 --> 14:45.449
Are you, like, schizo?No.

14:45.493 --> 14:47.321
I-I'm just introspective.

14:48.365 --> 14:49.932
Uh-huh.

14:49.976 --> 14:51.151
Cool.

14:51.194 --> 14:52.413
Cool.

14:55.111 --> 14:58.071
Oh! Hey! My phone.
Uh, it's buzzing.

14:58.114 --> 14:59.550
Hello?

14:59.594 --> 15:00.551
Oh, you're here?

15:00.595 --> 15:02.292
Sorry, my Uber's outside.

15:02.336 --> 15:04.599
Um, wait, when
did you call them?

15:04.642 --> 15:06.688
Oh, I didn't.
They called me.

15:06.731 --> 15:08.995
They do that now. They call
to see if you need a ride.

15:09.038 --> 15:10.953
Uh, yeah,
I'm at Home Base.

15:10.997 --> 15:11.954
I'll be right out.

15:11.998 --> 15:13.477
Sorry, got to protect my rating.

15:13.521 --> 15:14.914
You get it.Yeah.

15:14.957 --> 15:16.219
Totally. Um...

15:16.263 --> 15:17.568
It-it was nice meeting you.

15:17.612 --> 15:19.483
Uh-huh.

15:21.485 --> 15:23.400
Bye.

15:29.537 --> 15:31.843
Oh, hey, Jim. Jim.

15:31.887 --> 15:33.323
Okay, you'll never guess
what happened.

15:33.367 --> 15:35.325
So, three people came in,
and they ordered pretzels.

15:35.369 --> 15:37.240
They ordered plain,
cinnamon, and jalapeño.

15:37.284 --> 15:39.677
And I got them the pretzels.
And I gave them the pretzels.

15:39.721 --> 15:41.679
And they bit into
the pretzels...

15:41.723 --> 15:45.074
and they were truly happy.

15:45.118 --> 15:48.077
Like, that's what
happy looks like.

15:48.121 --> 15:50.079
She also forgot
to charge them.

15:50.123 --> 15:51.602
I paid for them myself.

15:51.646 --> 15:53.953
AJ, don't be a narc.

15:53.996 --> 15:56.825
I'm sorry. I'm just still
so confused that you work here.

15:56.868 --> 15:58.696
It is temporary.

15:58.740 --> 16:01.438
Um, honey,

16:01.482 --> 16:03.179
I got a text from Jim

16:03.223 --> 16:04.746
that you're working here?

16:04.789 --> 16:06.748
I was going to text
you myself, Paula.

16:06.791 --> 16:09.969
So... I went back up to work,
and something felt off.

16:10.012 --> 16:11.709
And I realized it's because
I don't know if I'm gonna

16:11.753 --> 16:13.363
be disbarred yet.
I'm waiting

16:13.407 --> 16:14.974
for that letter from
the bar association,

16:15.017 --> 16:16.976
and it feels unethical.
You get it.

16:17.019 --> 16:18.194
Yeah. Okay.

16:18.238 --> 16:19.587
But Wendy's coming back
for another meeting.

16:19.630 --> 16:20.936
What do I tell her?

16:20.980 --> 16:22.503
Tell her that I'm
working here for a while

16:22.546 --> 16:24.505
and she can come by for
a cinnamon on the house.

16:24.548 --> 16:26.507
We don't give people things
on the house. No.

16:26.550 --> 16:28.596
Oh, hey, Jim.
Miss you upstairs.

16:28.639 --> 16:29.945
Really?No.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.860
Rebecca, I am not bringing
Wendy by for a pretzel.

16:31.903 --> 16:34.428
In fact, if she walks by
and sees you here,

16:34.471 --> 16:36.386
I'm gonna tell her
that you have a dumb twin sister

16:36.430 --> 16:37.997
who works
at a stupid pretzel shop.

16:41.522 --> 16:45.265
So, I sent a picture
of my toe to my doctor.

16:45.308 --> 16:47.441
And he said
go to the emergency room.

16:47.484 --> 16:49.269
Okay. That's what I thought.
Let's go.

16:49.312 --> 16:50.444
Wait, are you insane?

16:50.487 --> 16:52.576
It costs $300
to text a doctor.

16:52.620 --> 16:54.578
An emergency room visit
will cost thousands of dollars,

16:54.622 --> 16:56.537
and I have
no health insurance. I...

16:56.580 --> 16:57.799
Right. So just
use my insurance.

16:57.842 --> 16:59.192
I can't. We're not related.

16:59.235 --> 17:01.542
Right. So let's
just get married.

17:01.585 --> 17:02.891
What?

17:02.934 --> 17:04.023
I mean, toe aside,

17:04.066 --> 17:05.981
just seems easier
all around, so...

17:06.025 --> 17:07.113
what do you think?

17:07.156 --> 17:08.418
What?

17:08.462 --> 17:09.593
What?

17:09.637 --> 17:10.942
I think it's
a great idea.

17:10.986 --> 17:12.944
I have a lunch break, too.

17:12.988 --> 17:14.337
You want to go?

17:14.381 --> 17:15.338
I do.

17:15.382 --> 17:16.948
I do.

17:16.992 --> 17:18.341
Congratulations.

17:18.385 --> 17:19.951
You're married.

17:20.996 --> 17:21.953
That's it?

17:21.997 --> 17:23.085
It's over?

17:23.129 --> 17:24.652
Or just beginning.

17:24.695 --> 17:26.523
Good luck with your toe.

17:33.400 --> 17:34.705
You're so beautiful.

17:34.749 --> 17:35.967
Stop.

17:36.011 --> 17:38.579
I'm so happy.

17:38.622 --> 17:41.495
I love you so much.

17:41.538 --> 17:42.931
Baby, me, too.

17:44.454 --> 17:46.413
Okay, now I'm crying.

18:03.952 --> 18:05.562
I love sugar.
I love the sugar.

18:05.606 --> 18:07.999
I love doing the sugar.

18:08.043 --> 18:09.653
Dibs on the sugars. 'Kay.

18:09.697 --> 18:11.220
JOSH:
Whoa.

18:11.264 --> 18:13.701
It's true.
You really do work here. Cool.

18:13.744 --> 18:16.356
Yeah, yeah.
For a little-little while.

18:16.399 --> 18:17.966
Hey, how's the dating going?

18:18.009 --> 18:19.272
Give me the update on the apps.

18:19.315 --> 18:20.838
The "appdate."

18:20.882 --> 18:22.710
It's not been going great.

18:22.753 --> 18:25.016
Well, maybe you're swiping
the wrong people.

18:25.060 --> 18:26.496
Let me help.

18:26.540 --> 18:28.585
I have amazing taste in people.Is that true?

18:28.629 --> 18:30.457
Definitely not. But
I want to swipe. Come on.

18:31.501 --> 18:33.460
All right. Oh.

18:33.503 --> 18:34.678
Okay, well, this is easy.

18:34.722 --> 18:36.463
First of all, we're
gonna reject anyone

18:36.506 --> 18:38.421
from University of
Blank or Blank State.

18:38.465 --> 18:41.685
So good-bye, University of Ohio,

18:41.729 --> 18:44.427
Florida, Arizona State...

18:44.471 --> 18:45.515
Go, Sun Devils!

18:45.559 --> 18:47.343
Is that Jim?

18:47.387 --> 18:49.737
Yeah, he's my boss now.
It's... Don't ask. Okay...

18:49.780 --> 18:52.305
Wait, wait. Who-who cares
where someone went to college?

18:55.134 --> 18:57.658
Oh. Once I loved you.

18:57.701 --> 18:59.660
Amazing.

18:59.703 --> 19:02.097
Mm, all right.
Oh, here's a girl. Zoe.

19:02.141 --> 19:04.578
Huh. She went to Brown,

19:04.621 --> 19:06.232
which, normally,
I'd say, "Blah."

19:06.275 --> 19:07.842
But she studied art history,

19:07.885 --> 19:09.670
and I happen to know Brown has
a good art history program.

19:09.713 --> 19:12.194
I feel good
about Zoe.

19:12.238 --> 19:14.588
I think she's gonna get you.
She's gonna get you, Josh.

19:16.242 --> 19:18.809
And you matched. Already.

19:18.853 --> 19:21.334
Am I smart enough for her?

19:21.377 --> 19:23.118
Yes.

19:23.162 --> 19:25.512
You are perceptive and kind,

19:25.555 --> 19:28.167
and that's a very valuable
type of intelligence.

19:28.210 --> 19:29.516
Trust me,
it'll be

19:29.559 --> 19:31.039
Louvre at first sight.

19:31.082 --> 19:32.040
Louvre.

19:32.083 --> 19:33.607
Good one.

19:35.609 --> 19:37.654
WENDY:
Nathaniel, glad you're here.

19:37.698 --> 19:40.396
What do you think about
Rebecca's easement proposal?

19:43.486 --> 19:45.009
PAULA:
I'm sorry.

19:45.053 --> 19:47.447
I-It's a whole thing.

19:47.490 --> 19:49.013
Fine with me.
Eye candy. Doesn't talk.

19:49.057 --> 19:50.014
That works.

19:50.058 --> 19:51.102
Where's Rebecca?

19:51.146 --> 19:52.713
PAULA:
She is...

19:52.756 --> 19:55.368
She works at a pretzel
shop downstairs.

19:55.411 --> 19:57.979
Geez, Tim!

19:58.022 --> 20:00.373
Who are you,
Narc Twain?

20:01.591 --> 20:02.810
She doesn't work there.

20:02.853 --> 20:04.725
Um, she's just having
a little fun

20:04.768 --> 20:06.248
till she comes back
full-time.

20:06.292 --> 20:09.643
It's like a...
a-a tiny gap year.

20:09.686 --> 20:11.993
A gap year.
I did one of those.

20:12.036 --> 20:13.560
So did Malia Obama.

20:13.603 --> 20:15.475
She went to South
and Central America

20:15.518 --> 20:16.998
and learned a lot about herself.

20:17.041 --> 20:19.392
I went to Arkansas to help
my aunt raise her five kids

20:19.435 --> 20:21.263
after her husband put a gun
in his mouth.

20:21.307 --> 20:22.786
I learned a lot
about myself, too.

20:22.830 --> 20:24.919
My tubes are tied.

20:25.963 --> 20:29.140
Who is working on my case?

20:29.184 --> 20:30.620
Miss LeGrand, do not worry.

20:30.664 --> 20:33.623
Your case is
of the utmost importance.

20:33.667 --> 20:36.974
Great. You know what's also
of the utmost importance?

20:37.018 --> 20:40.500
That Rebecca come back. Now.

20:41.892 --> 20:43.807
Yes.

20:43.851 --> 20:46.593
I... am an artist.

20:46.636 --> 20:49.509
Okay, Jim, I went to the market,
and I got some new ingredients

20:49.552 --> 20:50.988
to make these
exciting new flavors.

20:51.032 --> 20:53.904
We got chocolate peanut butter,
vanilla lavender,

20:53.948 --> 20:56.080
and honey bacon.

20:56.124 --> 20:58.126
Uh, that one's not kosher.

20:58.169 --> 20:59.562
They're all not kosher.

20:59.606 --> 21:00.955
Corporate won't let us
do new flavors.

21:00.998 --> 21:02.783
I can't even put extra salt
on a pretzel.

21:02.826 --> 21:04.915
They're really strict about what
we can and can't sell.

21:04.959 --> 21:06.308
Yeah, I worked at

21:06.352 --> 21:07.527
the Pretzel Central in
Claremont. The owner there

21:07.570 --> 21:10.138
put extra frosting on
his almond pretzels.

21:10.181 --> 21:12.227
He got banned
from the franchise

21:12.271 --> 21:14.577
and excommunicated
from the church.

21:14.621 --> 21:16.318
They have so much pull.

21:16.362 --> 21:18.625
Oh, I'm sorry.

21:18.668 --> 21:20.670
I've already been selling these.

21:20.714 --> 21:22.063
Forgot to tell you.
Love you.

21:22.106 --> 21:23.717
But really, they've been
selling like hotcakes,

21:23.760 --> 21:25.371
which is funny
'cause they're pretzels.

21:25.414 --> 21:27.547
Whoa, new idea.
Hotcake pretzels.

21:27.590 --> 21:29.636
No, no, no. No, no, you
can't do that. If it's

21:29.679 --> 21:31.725
not approved by corporate,
it could get me shut down.

21:31.768 --> 21:34.771
I'm scared of those people,
and I like to follow rules.Jim.

21:34.815 --> 21:36.425
Who's gonna tell 'em?

21:36.469 --> 21:38.427
Narc Zuckerberg over here?
Maybe.

21:40.081 --> 21:42.866
Do you have a notebook where
you're brainstorming narc puns?

21:42.910 --> 21:44.999
Maybe. Jim, don't forget

21:45.042 --> 21:46.783
your mission, why you're
doing this in the first place.

21:46.827 --> 21:48.655
You're striking out on your own.

21:48.698 --> 21:51.832
And I'm right by your side, pal.
We're gonna forge our own path.

21:51.875 --> 21:54.574
I'm just trying
to be a small business owner.

21:54.617 --> 21:56.576
Boo, you got to get it together.

21:56.619 --> 21:57.794
Just follow the rules.

21:57.838 --> 22:00.231
You're worrying me.

22:03.800 --> 22:05.498
AUTHOR :
Svalbard.

22:05.541 --> 22:07.891
A Norwegian archipelago nestled

22:07.935 --> 22:10.198
in the Arctic Ocean
and the birthplace

22:10.241 --> 22:13.462
of the Scandinavian
primitivist movement.

22:13.506 --> 22:14.637
Wake up, Josh!

22:14.681 --> 22:16.639
Rebecca was lying to you.

22:16.683 --> 22:20.034
Zoe is never going to like you
unless you learn some art.

22:20.077 --> 22:21.644
Now, look alive, young chap.

22:21.688 --> 22:23.211
I'm not reading this
for my health.

22:23.254 --> 22:25.039
I already know what it says.
I wrote it.

22:25.082 --> 22:26.780
Okay, okay, you're right.
I-I'm sorry.

22:26.823 --> 22:29.348
AUTHOR:
Now I have to start over.

22:29.391 --> 22:31.001
Bollocks.

22:31.045 --> 22:34.657
Okay. Svalbard.
A Norwegian archipelago

22:34.701 --> 22:37.486
nestled in the Arctic Ocean...

22:38.531 --> 22:40.228
Hey, Cookie?

22:40.271 --> 22:41.751
I don't mean to bother you,
'cause I know

22:41.795 --> 22:43.579
you're enjoying yourself,
but have you

22:43.623 --> 22:44.885
gotten that
bar association letter?

22:44.928 --> 22:46.974
Can you come back to work?
Like, now?

22:47.017 --> 22:47.975
BERT:
Wendy, w-wait, hold on a second.

22:48.018 --> 22:50.543
Oh, hey.
Look who's here.

22:50.586 --> 22:52.022
It's our big client, Wendy.

22:52.066 --> 22:53.633
And we're
here with our

22:53.676 --> 22:55.765
most important client,
here at Pretzel Central.

22:55.809 --> 22:57.680
: I'm so sorry.
I-I tried to stop her,

22:57.724 --> 22:59.595
but, of course,
I couldn't put hands on her,

22:59.639 --> 23:01.771
so I tried to control
her movements with my eyes,

23:01.815 --> 23:04.034
but I seem
to have lost my powers.

23:04.078 --> 23:06.820
I had to see this for myself.
This is insane.

23:06.863 --> 23:08.038
Rebecca,

23:08.082 --> 23:09.431
that apron makes you look...

23:09.475 --> 23:10.476
Pretty?

23:10.519 --> 23:12.129
Poor.

23:12.173 --> 23:13.479
Guys, I'm fine.
And Wendy,

23:13.522 --> 23:14.697
I will be back
before you know it,

23:14.741 --> 23:16.395
and then you and I
can take that easement

23:16.438 --> 23:17.700
and make angry love to it.

23:17.744 --> 23:19.267
AJ: Here.Yeah, this one's
on the house.

23:19.310 --> 23:21.878
Let's go.PAULA:
All right.

23:21.922 --> 23:23.880
AJ:
So,

23:23.924 --> 23:25.665
when are you gonna tell them you
got the letter and you're free

23:25.708 --> 23:27.928
to practice law?

23:27.971 --> 23:30.104
How do you know about
that, Narcer Posey?

23:36.240 --> 23:38.025
Aah! Whoa.

23:38.068 --> 23:40.201
Whoa.Yeah!

23:40.244 --> 23:42.029
Welcome home, my bride.

23:42.072 --> 23:43.596
Oh.

23:43.639 --> 23:45.772
Wow, bride.

23:45.815 --> 23:47.251
We're married.I know.

23:47.295 --> 23:49.340
Right?So, I was thinking

23:49.384 --> 23:51.604
for the actual wedding
we can do doves.

23:51.647 --> 23:53.344
I was thinking lots of flowers.

23:53.388 --> 23:54.955
I was thinking my abuela
can do a hymn.

23:54.998 --> 23:56.913
Wedding?
We already had a wedding.

23:56.957 --> 23:58.524
I know. And-and it was sweet.Mm-hmm.

23:58.567 --> 24:00.439
But now we can have
a real wedding

24:00.482 --> 24:02.005
with the people we love.

24:02.049 --> 24:05.052
Oh, you're one of those.

24:05.095 --> 24:06.445
You mean a person?

24:06.488 --> 24:08.359
Well...Heather, I've been thinking

24:08.403 --> 24:10.361
about our wedding
for a while now.

24:10.405 --> 24:11.885
Like, before the toe proposal.

24:11.928 --> 24:13.843
I want a real wedding.

24:13.887 --> 24:16.629
You in a white dress,
and me in a tux.

24:16.672 --> 24:18.805
In a church.Hector.

24:18.848 --> 24:20.546
Come on, we don't need
to make our love

24:20.589 --> 24:22.504
into some big production.

24:22.548 --> 24:24.332
I mean, our culture
turns human emotion

24:24.375 --> 24:27.291
into some consumer trade show.

24:27.335 --> 24:29.250
Our love, our
actuallove,

24:29.293 --> 24:31.644
is better than
waffle makers

24:31.687 --> 24:34.908
and ice cream makers
and pasta machines.

24:34.951 --> 24:36.257
By the way, I'm so starving.

24:36.300 --> 24:39.739
But that's not, like,
who we are. Right?

24:42.219 --> 24:45.179
No, I guess not.

24:45.222 --> 24:46.441
I guess...

24:46.485 --> 24:48.051
you know, I guess we can wait.

24:48.095 --> 24:50.271
And-and maybe
for our ten-year anniversary,

24:50.314 --> 24:53.187
we can renew our vows

24:53.230 --> 24:56.277
and do a small barbecue.

24:56.320 --> 24:58.975
Thank you.
That sounds perfect.

24:59.019 --> 25:00.411
Yep.

25:00.455 --> 25:01.804
You get it.

25:04.894 --> 25:06.461
REBECCA:
How do you know I got

25:06.505 --> 25:07.680
the letter from the
bar association?

25:07.723 --> 25:09.377
You threw it in the garbage.

25:09.420 --> 25:10.596
So you just picked it up?

25:10.639 --> 25:12.728
No. I picked it up and read it.

25:12.772 --> 25:14.295
Congratulations.

25:14.338 --> 25:15.557
You can practice law again.

25:15.601 --> 25:18.125
Look, don't tell anybody.
Please.

25:18.168 --> 25:20.475
Please. Be my hero.

25:20.519 --> 25:22.869
Be my Joan of No-Narc.

25:22.912 --> 25:24.523
Wow, you really

25:24.566 --> 25:26.873
don't want to be a lawyer,
do you?

25:26.916 --> 25:28.701
Well, what are you gonna do--
stay in this pretzel shop

25:28.744 --> 25:31.268
forever?I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

25:43.106 --> 25:45.108
What do you guys
think I should do?

25:46.849 --> 25:48.285
You know me better than anyone.

25:48.329 --> 25:50.679
You've been with me
since I got here.

25:50.723 --> 25:53.900

♪ This twisted fate.

27:27.558 --> 27:30.474
TRULY BUTTER:
Ugh, tell me about it.

27:30.518 --> 27:31.824
Ah...

27:31.867 --> 27:35.131
the age-old question:

27:35.175 --> 27:37.656
pretzels or law?

27:37.699 --> 27:39.658
Pretzels or law?

27:47.840 --> 27:50.059
You know, I think that guy at
the church owes me a favor.

27:50.103 --> 27:52.061
Oh, hey.Heya.

27:52.105 --> 27:54.716
Hey.Hello, friends. Wait. No.

27:54.760 --> 27:57.458
What's going on here?
What's up?

27:57.501 --> 28:00.287
What's up is you got married and
didn't want to have a wedding?

28:00.330 --> 28:02.855
That's like getting married and
not wanting to have a wedding.

28:02.898 --> 28:04.378
How did you know I got married?

28:04.421 --> 28:05.335
The judge tagged you
on Instagram.

28:05.379 --> 28:06.641
Also, Hector told us.

28:06.685 --> 28:08.991
Okay, well, look,
our wedding is private.

28:09.035 --> 28:10.732
No. Body parts are private.

28:10.776 --> 28:12.647
Weddings are for everybody.

28:12.691 --> 28:15.389
Okay, I'm really regretting
giving youa key.

28:15.432 --> 28:18.218
Also, did Hector
ask you to come here?

28:18.261 --> 28:20.307
Actually, after your
sad court ceremony,

28:20.350 --> 28:22.613
he did call and ask
us to plan something.

28:22.657 --> 28:25.094
And then he said you
didn't want to do it.

28:25.138 --> 28:27.488
He said that you
talked him out of it.

28:27.531 --> 28:29.664
No, that's not what happened.
We had a discussion

28:29.708 --> 28:32.623
and decided to do our own thing
and just follow our own path.

28:32.667 --> 28:35.061
Ourpath?
Sounds like yourpath.

28:35.104 --> 28:36.410
Look, I care

28:36.453 --> 28:38.717
about Hector and his happiness.

28:38.760 --> 28:40.544
Yeah, I can't say that
with a straight face.

28:40.588 --> 28:43.156
We just need a beautiful
couple for our website.

28:43.199 --> 28:45.462
Okay? We keep doing weddings
for some real uggos.

28:45.506 --> 28:46.942
BETH:
She's right.
It's a nightmare.

28:46.986 --> 28:48.465
It's like
we're attracting them.

28:48.509 --> 28:49.815
Yeah, it's like, some people

28:49.858 --> 28:51.512
should legally
not be allowed to get married.

28:53.906 --> 28:55.472
What?

28:55.516 --> 28:56.778
Mm...

28:56.822 --> 28:58.954
JOSH:
I mean, I like impressionism

28:58.998 --> 29:02.001
because it disrupted
the aesthetic

29:02.044 --> 29:04.481
of the overly
realistic paintings

29:04.525 --> 29:07.528
that were being shown in the
Salon in Paris at the time,

29:07.571 --> 29:10.574
which was nota hair salon,
by the way.

29:10.618 --> 29:14.491
Huh. I actually think
that's an unfair generalization

29:14.535 --> 29:17.103
of the Academy painters
of the late 19th century.

29:17.146 --> 29:19.192
Yeah.

29:19.235 --> 29:21.368
Um, sorry.

29:21.411 --> 29:23.544
I wasn't expecting you
to disagree with my statement,

29:23.587 --> 29:25.328
which I had perceived as fact.

29:25.372 --> 29:27.330
Josh, can I stop you?

29:27.374 --> 29:28.549
I appreciate your effort,

29:28.592 --> 29:30.812
but I didn't come on this date

29:30.856 --> 29:33.206
to talk about art.

29:33.249 --> 29:34.685
But you're all about art.

29:34.729 --> 29:36.339
Not after 8:00 p.m.
After 8:00 p.m.,

29:36.383 --> 29:39.081
I am all about
shirtless deejays.

29:39.125 --> 29:40.343
Really?Mm-hmm.

29:40.387 --> 29:41.388
Is my bro DJ Skin-man

29:41.431 --> 29:42.955
spinning tonight? Dude!

29:42.998 --> 29:46.175
No, um,
I meant... I meant you.

29:46.219 --> 29:47.655
Me?Yeah.

29:47.698 --> 29:50.963
Your dating profile is
seven pictures of you shirtless.

29:51.006 --> 29:53.400
Your Instagram is you shirtless,

29:53.443 --> 29:56.533
doing karate.
You totally show off your bod.What?

29:56.577 --> 29:59.188
That's not me showing off
my bod. Those are my hobbies.

29:59.232 --> 30:00.842
Yeah, I've been doing them
since I was a kid.

30:00.886 --> 30:02.801
I'm... My shirt is off
because I run hot.

30:02.844 --> 30:04.367
Yeah, you do run hot.

30:04.411 --> 30:08.023
No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

30:08.067 --> 30:09.503
Oh.

30:09.546 --> 30:11.810
I'm sorry.

30:11.853 --> 30:14.160
I misunderstood
what this date was.

30:14.203 --> 30:16.379
I wanted to sleep
with a hot deejay,

30:16.423 --> 30:18.860
and you wanted to talk about
the epistemological feud

30:18.904 --> 30:20.862
between Manet
and Jean-Léon Gérôme.

30:20.906 --> 30:23.647
Huh No.
So confused.

30:23.691 --> 30:26.650
So you're not interested
in a relationship?

30:29.392 --> 30:31.438
Gosh, sorry.

30:31.481 --> 30:34.615
My Uber's calling. Mm.

30:34.658 --> 30:35.834
Oh, yeah.

30:35.877 --> 30:37.487
I-I just heard about that.

30:37.531 --> 30:39.881
Yeah. It's a thing.

30:39.925 --> 30:41.665
Hello. I'll be right out.

30:56.985 --> 30:58.160
Hey.

30:58.204 --> 30:59.858
Hey.

30:59.901 --> 31:02.469
Rebecca,
what are you doing here?

31:02.512 --> 31:04.471
It's from the
bar association.

31:06.342 --> 31:09.128
Ah!
This is great news!

31:09.171 --> 31:10.738
See?
I told you.

31:10.781 --> 31:12.174
You're back.

31:12.218 --> 31:13.480
You're really back.

31:13.523 --> 31:14.655
Back in action.

31:14.698 --> 31:17.440
Well, all right.Oh...

31:24.839 --> 31:27.973
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

31:28.016 --> 31:31.280
Oh, man, I'm just so happy
we can get back to work.

31:31.324 --> 31:32.499
Aren't you?

31:33.717 --> 31:36.068
Yeah. Yeah.

31:36.111 --> 31:37.547
Wendy, thrilling news:

31:37.591 --> 31:40.028
I called
the city council and said

31:40.072 --> 31:41.551
if they didn't lift
the zoning restriction

31:41.595 --> 31:43.989
that we would file a suit
under statute 45a.

31:44.032 --> 31:46.513
Um, so...

31:46.556 --> 31:50.125
Who let the zoning out,
yeah, yeah.

31:52.171 --> 31:53.520
This one.

31:53.563 --> 31:54.695
Yeah.

31:54.738 --> 31:57.393
Uh, sorry. One s-second.

31:57.437 --> 31:59.656
You know what?

31:59.700 --> 32:01.484
I should actually take this,
it's my friend

32:01.528 --> 32:03.182
from the zoning commission.

32:03.225 --> 32:04.531
Uh, it says it's Jim.

32:04.574 --> 32:06.663
I have more than one friend
named Jim, you racist.

32:06.707 --> 32:10.102
Excuse me for one moment.

32:10.145 --> 32:11.973
Hi. What's up?JIM: Corporate's here.

32:12.017 --> 32:13.801
They saw all the violations in
here and we're in trouble.

32:13.844 --> 32:14.802
I need you.

32:14.845 --> 32:16.282
Rebecca?

32:16.325 --> 32:17.631
You were saying?

32:25.073 --> 32:27.728
I'm sorry.
I am so sorry, sir.

32:27.771 --> 32:29.338
Hi. What's going on here?

32:29.382 --> 32:31.645
There are numerous violations
of ingredients and recipes,

32:31.688 --> 32:34.517
not to mention hair all over
your flour canister.

32:34.561 --> 32:36.519
Okay, I cannot wear a hair net,
not with this face shape.

32:36.563 --> 32:37.912
Sir, I'm an attorney.
Listen, I understand

32:37.956 --> 32:39.131
that you have a
corporately-mandated way

32:39.174 --> 32:40.697
of doing things,
but we're just trying

32:40.741 --> 32:42.525
to increase the profit margins.

32:42.569 --> 32:44.353
I'm sorry, who are you?

32:44.397 --> 32:45.572
Oh, she's the
Rooftop Killer.

32:45.615 --> 32:48.792
Man. Narc by Narc Jacobs.

32:48.836 --> 32:52.361
Jim, we're gonna shut you down
until you return everything

32:52.405 --> 32:55.582
to franchise standards,
then you can reopen.

32:57.366 --> 32:59.020
Oh, my God, Jim.
Jim, I am so sorry.

32:59.064 --> 33:00.935
I-I will...
I will cover the cost

33:00.979 --> 33:03.329
to turn everything back
to the way it was.

33:03.372 --> 33:06.158
Yeah, don't bother.

33:06.201 --> 33:08.334
I haven't had a
good experience.

33:08.377 --> 33:10.118
I don't want to be
a boss. It's awful.

33:10.162 --> 33:13.034
I want someone to tell me
where to go and what to do,

33:13.078 --> 33:14.166
then I get to complain
to my friends

33:14.209 --> 33:15.906
and eat snacks
someone else paid for.

33:15.950 --> 33:17.386
I'm going back upstairs.

33:17.430 --> 33:20.172
Back to being a lawyer.

33:20.215 --> 33:21.564
N-n-n-n-no.
Hey, yeah, you can't.

33:21.608 --> 33:24.002
Watch me.

33:24.045 --> 33:25.786
♪ Whoo!

33:25.829 --> 33:27.875
♪ Uh.

33:37.363 --> 33:38.494
Hey, Becks.

33:38.538 --> 33:40.714
Oh, hi.

33:40.757 --> 33:43.325
Why would anyone eat
hard pretzels

33:43.369 --> 33:46.502
They're just sad little
mummified soft pretzels.

33:47.851 --> 33:49.679
Oh, how was your date?

33:49.723 --> 33:51.029
Ugh, it was awful.

33:51.072 --> 33:52.552
I did all this research
to try to impress her,

33:52.595 --> 33:55.207
but she just wanted
Josh Chan for his body.

33:55.250 --> 33:57.426
Oh, is that why you're wearing
a very oversized sweatshirt?

33:57.470 --> 33:58.862
Can you see that I'm flexing?

33:58.906 --> 33:59.994
No.No.

34:00.038 --> 34:01.387
No, you can't, and
that's on purpose.

34:01.430 --> 34:03.302
This gun show is
closed for business.

34:03.345 --> 34:04.433
Mm.

34:04.477 --> 34:06.566
I'm so disappointed.

34:06.609 --> 34:08.089
The-the girls
from high school--

34:08.133 --> 34:09.569
they just, like,
want Josh Chan

34:09.612 --> 34:11.223
the prom king on
their Christmas card.

34:11.266 --> 34:13.616
The art historians just want
to do it with some stud.

34:13.660 --> 34:15.923
And the thing is...

34:15.966 --> 34:18.099
I don't want to be a
concept or an object.

34:18.143 --> 34:21.407
Wow, that's... that's profound.

34:22.408 --> 34:24.410
You are killing
this therapy thing.

34:26.803 --> 34:28.762
So, uh, how did the date end?

34:28.805 --> 34:30.024
Oh, her Uber called.

34:30.068 --> 34:31.634
You know how
they call you now

34:31.678 --> 34:33.854
before you even order them just
to see if you want a ride?

34:33.897 --> 34:37.423
Oh, honey,
that makes no sense.

34:37.466 --> 34:39.729
Oh, yeah.

34:39.773 --> 34:41.340
Duh.

34:41.383 --> 34:43.385
That doesn't make sense.

34:43.429 --> 34:44.995
Pretzel?

34:45.039 --> 34:47.215
Uh, no, I'm good.Okay.

34:47.259 --> 34:50.088
Rebecca, I think I know
what I have to do.

34:50.131 --> 34:51.393
Really, what's that?

34:51.437 --> 34:52.742
Stop trying to be
who someone else

34:52.786 --> 34:56.050
wants me to be and...

34:56.094 --> 34:58.661
just try to be
who I want to be.

34:58.705 --> 35:00.968
Yeah...

35:01.011 --> 35:03.057
Yeah.

35:03.101 --> 35:05.407
That's a really good point.

35:06.974 --> 35:09.542
See?
You're smart.

35:13.198 --> 35:15.200
Hey.Hey, honey. What's up?

35:15.243 --> 35:16.592
Hey. Come in.

35:16.636 --> 35:18.072
I want to talk to you
about something.

35:18.116 --> 35:20.857
Okay.

35:23.251 --> 35:25.079
Um...

35:25.123 --> 35:26.646
so, yeah.

35:26.689 --> 35:28.952
Uh...

35:28.996 --> 35:30.998
Paula, I...

35:32.304 --> 35:34.306
I don't want to be
a lawyer anymore.

35:35.350 --> 35:37.091
I never wanted to.

35:37.135 --> 35:39.006
It was never my dream.
It was my mother's dream.

35:39.049 --> 35:40.050
Wow.

35:40.094 --> 35:41.095
And it's your dream.

35:41.139 --> 35:42.662
It's your dream,
which is great.

35:42.705 --> 35:44.185
The profession needs
more people like you,

35:44.229 --> 35:47.493
who care about all that
hideously boring crap.

35:49.973 --> 35:52.802
Wow.

35:52.846 --> 35:56.676
So you're... never coming back
to the office?

35:58.678 --> 36:01.463
I don't think so. No.

36:04.118 --> 36:05.902
Where does that leave you?

36:13.432 --> 36:16.304
So, it wouldn't be
Pretzel Central anymore.

36:16.348 --> 36:19.873
It'd be my own thing.

36:19.916 --> 36:22.789
And I'm thinking
of calling it...

36:22.832 --> 36:25.400
Rebetzel's.

36:25.444 --> 36:26.880
Oh, I love it.

36:26.923 --> 36:29.404
You ending up owning
a pretzel shop--

36:29.448 --> 36:31.972
it feels right. It
feels like destiny,

36:32.015 --> 36:33.452
in a way.

36:33.495 --> 36:36.411
No. You know, I don't believe
in destiny anymore.

36:36.455 --> 36:37.934
I just believe in

36:37.978 --> 36:40.502
taking responsibility

36:40.546 --> 36:42.025
for your own happiness.

36:42.069 --> 36:43.940
And right now, for me,

36:43.984 --> 36:46.508
that's my friends,

36:46.552 --> 36:48.728
volunteering at the jail,

36:48.771 --> 36:50.599
and...

36:50.643 --> 36:52.862
this pretzel shop,
as crazy as that seems.

36:52.906 --> 36:55.561
And, Paula,
I'm so sorry to leave you

36:55.604 --> 36:56.649
hanging upstairs...Uh-uh, no, no, no.

36:56.692 --> 36:58.651
Stop. Don't apologize.

36:58.694 --> 37:00.957
As long as you are happy.

37:01.001 --> 37:02.437
That is what matters to me.

37:02.481 --> 37:04.874
Truly.

37:04.918 --> 37:07.181
It always has.

37:07.225 --> 37:08.487
Oh.

37:08.530 --> 37:09.705
What time is it?

37:09.749 --> 37:10.793
Tim and I started
sharing a watch.

37:10.837 --> 37:12.317
I don't know why
I agreed to that.

37:12.360 --> 37:14.493
You know, we should go.
We don't want to be late.Okay.

37:17.626 --> 37:18.801
Hey, man.

37:18.845 --> 37:20.412
Been a while.

37:20.455 --> 37:21.630
Psyched to play ball?

37:21.674 --> 37:23.153
We're not playing ball today.

37:23.197 --> 37:24.764
We're not?

37:30.378 --> 37:31.510
Is that a tuxedo?

37:31.553 --> 37:32.641
Yeah.

37:34.643 --> 37:35.862
Is that for me?

37:35.905 --> 37:36.993
Yeah.

I thought you
didn't want this.

38:48.064 --> 38:50.153
And that's what matters.

Do your thing, Brah.

39:05.212 --> 39:07.562
Roger that, Heather.

39:07.606 --> 39:09.216
But first, before we begin,

39:09.259 --> 39:11.392
Heather has asked
a good friend who is

39:11.436 --> 39:12.828
great with words

39:12.872 --> 39:14.874
and also very proud of where
she went to college,

And this is from
the greatest fairy tale

39:31.804 --> 39:33.762
Oh.

39:33.806 --> 39:35.416
I made some changes
because there's always room

39:35.460 --> 39:37.244
