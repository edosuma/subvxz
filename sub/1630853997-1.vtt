I want to talk to you
this morning

08:59.043 --> 09:01.241
about two kinds of riches.

09:02.915 --> 09:07.852
Gold, which you all came
here to find, and grace.

09:07.887 --> 09:09.216
So what is this grace?

09:09.251 --> 09:11.790
What do we mean
when we speak of it?

09:11.825 --> 09:14.320
It is said that
grace is none other

09:14.355 --> 09:19.633
than the source
and inspiration of the divine

09:19.668 --> 09:25.166
working within us to inspire
our most virtuous impulses.

09:25.201 --> 09:28.906
So while you're hammering away
at that unforgiving mountain,

09:28.941 --> 09:33.141
you remember earthly gold
without divine grace

09:33.176 --> 09:39.114
is a fool's gold and brings
you nothing

09:39.149 --> 09:41.314
but destruction and disaster.

09:43.153 --> 09:45.923
-Whoo-hoo!

09:46.761 --> 09:48.387
Yeah! Everybody!

09:48.422 --> 09:52.028
Listen up!
I just found gold!

09:52.063 --> 09:53.931
Whoo!

09:53.966 --> 09:59.431

It's a miracle!

09:59.466 --> 10:01.268

people.

the peace, Sheriff.

10:31.333 --> 10:33.102

10:33.137 --> 10:35.236
-No, Sheriff.

10:35.271 --> 10:37.172
I don't think so.

10:38.439 --> 10:40.208
How rich are you?

10:40.243 --> 10:41.979
-We're rich.

10:42.014 --> 10:43.717
- Think there'll be
a little for me?

10:43.752 --> 10:45.345

10:45.380 --> 10:46.918
Alright, everyone,

You think that covers a round
for the whole town?

10:59.900 --> 11:01.295
What do you think?
You think I'm going to fall

11:01.330 --> 11:03.869

holy shit.

11:10.306 --> 11:11.503
Did you blow the hillside?

11:11.538 --> 11:13.076
Is that what I heard
this morning?

11:13.111 --> 11:17.146
Ah, yeah, I had a feeling.
Just a feeling.

11:17.181 --> 11:19.346
That stubborn wife of mine
kept telling me

11:19.381 --> 11:21.117
"There's no way
it's going to pay off."

11:21.152 --> 11:23.020
Quit, she says,
let's move to Oregon.

11:23.055 --> 11:25.517
If you move to Oregon,
I kill you.

11:25.552 --> 11:27.222
Well, I ain't moving to Oregon!

11:27.257 --> 11:29.796
I told her, "Emma, shut your
mouth because I know,

11:29.831 --> 11:31.193
I just know."

11:31.228 --> 11:32.865
And I came to town
looking for that dynamite.

11:32.900 --> 11:33.932
You remember that,
don't you, Wilcox?

11:33.967 --> 11:35.362
I certainly do.

11:35.397 --> 11:37.001
You told me I didn't have
no money for no dynamite.

11:37.036 --> 11:38.937
And you was right.

11:38.972 --> 11:41.038
So I traded you my daddy's
old pocket watch.

11:41.073 --> 11:43.106
Got it right here.

11:43.141 --> 11:46.142
- And you gave me a little
extra dynamite for good luck.

11:46.177 --> 11:47.781
And I don't forget that.

11:47.816 --> 11:51.114
So, uh, tell you what
I'm going to do.

11:51.149 --> 11:54.953
I'm gonna offer to buy back
that gold watch

11:54.988 --> 11:56.449
for a nice little profit
on your end.

11:56.484 --> 11:58.187
How's that sound?

11:58.222 --> 11:59.958
Well, I'll be god damned.

12:02.391 --> 12:03.863
Whoo!

12:03.898 --> 12:05.194
Because I blew that dynamite.

12:05.229 --> 12:09.099
Oh, Lordy.
What she gave me was

12:09.134 --> 12:11.431
more gold than you ever
seen your life.

12:11.466 --> 12:14.335
It's gonna take a lot of work
getting it out the ground now.

12:14.370 --> 12:17.173

to buy again.

17:21.446 --> 17:24.513
The whole point is
to tell the truth anyway,

17:24.548 --> 17:28.451
and then leave it to God
to soften their hearts

17:28.486 --> 17:30.189
so they'll listen.

17:32.193 --> 17:35.854
And anyway, I'm not rocky soil.

17:35.889 --> 17:38.197
I hear every word you say,

17:38.232 --> 17:40.760
and every word
makes me love you more.

19:05.946 --> 19:08.650
♪ Darling, oh, my darling ♪

19:08.685 --> 19:12.357
♪ Oh, my darling Clementine ♪

19:12.392 --> 19:15.723
♪ You were long gone forever ♪

19:15.758 --> 19:19.595
♪ Dreadful sorrow, Clementine ♪

19:19.630 --> 19:22.235
♪ Just a stich of dynamite ♪

19:22.270 --> 19:26.701
♪ And you lit it up
and blow a hole ♪

19:26.736 --> 19:29.506
♪ My luck sure is changing ♪

19:29.541 --> 19:31.475
♪ I can smell ♪

19:38.484 --> 19:40.253
Rooster!

19:40.288 --> 19:43.520
Who's there?! Who's there?!

19:43.555 --> 19:44.917
Come on out!

19:46.921 --> 19:49.559
Harding, is that you?!

19:49.594 --> 19:52.265
You killed Rooster,
you son of a bitch!

19:52.300 --> 19:55.994
You want my gold, you come
and get it, alright?!

19:56.029 --> 19:57.534
Come find me like a man!

19:58.702 --> 20:00.031
Where are you?

20:00.066 --> 20:02.539
Where are you?! Ah!

20:30.998 --> 20:36.001
"I swept away your fences
like a cloud, your dreams

20:36.036 --> 20:37.805
like morning mist.

20:37.840 --> 20:41.545
Return to me, for I have
redeemed you."

20:41.580 --> 20:44.878
Isaiah- 22.

20:45.947 --> 20:47.980
Muy bien, Carissa.

20:48.015 --> 20:50.950
Everything's going to change
with the mine running,

20:50.985 --> 20:52.655
people coming back.

20:52.690 --> 20:55.053
Maybe some man will make me
an honest woman again.

20:55.088 --> 20:57.858
Men don't look for wives
in a whorehouse, Ginny.

20:57.893 --> 21:00.432
When they want to get married,
they'll go to a church.

21:00.467 --> 21:02.060
Well, that's why
Miss Alice is here,

21:02.095 --> 21:05.470
to make this feel
more like a church.

21:05.505 --> 21:07.505
Would you like to get
married someday?

21:07.540 --> 21:13.104
He was kind and gentle
and treated me nice.

21:13.139 --> 21:14.776
Well, I'm never going
to marry a man.

21:14.811 --> 21:15.975
I know what they're like.

21:16.010 --> 21:18.582
You just haven't
met the right one.

21:18.617 --> 21:22.751
Isabel would.
She'd marry Robert Dunnigan.

21:22.786 --> 21:25.116
But he is already married.

21:25.151 --> 21:29.054
Well, if it is a sin to love
a married man,

21:29.089 --> 21:30.957
God will forgive me.

21:32.532 --> 21:35.027
Is that true? If he's married.

21:37.438 --> 21:41.473
The only sin is
to turn away from God.

21:41.508 --> 21:45.345
And if we look to him in sinful
things, they seem less tempting.

21:46.579 --> 21:49.140
Well, I do hope
Lord will forgive me,

21:49.175 --> 21:51.549
but I do know
the smart one somewhere

21:51.584 --> 21:53.881
ain't finished her chores yet.

21:55.687 --> 21:58.358
-Josephine.
-Get it done.

22:22.043 --> 22:25.583
We got nobody to make a casket.
Can you do it?

22:25.618 --> 22:27.585
Give him a proper funeral.

22:40.600 --> 22:43.029
Who would do a thing like this?

22:45.770 --> 22:47.935
No.

22:58.618 --> 23:03.654
Sheriff Ambrose,
whoever did this,

23:03.689 --> 23:06.085
I hope he dies just like this!

23:08.023 --> 23:11.926
Only one man in town don't know
what I'm going to do to him.

23:14.062 --> 23:16.029
Rise and shine.

23:17.604 --> 23:19.098
Don't.

23:27.042 --> 23:28.811
-Check those drawers.
-Got it.

23:32.047 --> 23:33.783
We got gold.

23:36.755 --> 23:40.493
Where'd you get this?

23:40.528 --> 23:42.154
Lock him up.

23:44.664 --> 23:46.697
Hey! Ah!

23:53.772 --> 23:55.508
Get!

23:57.611 --> 24:01.272
-You just made a mistake, boy!
-Come on!

24:01.307 --> 24:03.780
Get down.

24:18.929 --> 24:21.996
-Yeah. You did it, boy.
-I did not do it.

24:22.031 --> 24:24.768
You did it, caught red handed.

24:35.011 --> 24:36.681
Get in there.

24:36.716 --> 24:39.079
Oh!

24:40.885 --> 24:44.788
You think you can
bloody my face? Hm?

24:44.823 --> 24:48.055
You want to fight, go on,
strike me again.

24:48.090 --> 24:50.255
Get up.

24:50.290 --> 24:52.598
Come on, get up.

24:55.669 --> 24:57.097
Oh, come on.

25:03.875 --> 25:05.303
He attacked officers of the law.

25:05.338 --> 25:08.746
I saw the god damn law.

25:16.657 --> 25:19.053
Let me tell you
something about this town.

25:19.088 --> 25:21.726
You know, folks came here
because they wanted something

25:21.761 --> 25:24.025
better, a better life.

25:24.060 --> 25:25.928
And for a while,
when the mine was running,

25:25.963 --> 25:27.897
they had it.

25:27.932 --> 25:30.262
Then the mine collapsed,

25:30.297 --> 25:32.935
took all the gold
and half the men with it.

25:32.970 --> 25:35.135
And, uh, that's
the kind of thing

25:35.170 --> 25:37.137
that makes a town lose hope.

25:37.172 --> 25:41.845
And yesterday, Robert Dunnigan
strikes gold.

25:41.880 --> 25:46.080
But it's more than one strike.

25:46.720 --> 25:49.347
It gives people
who have nothing

25:49.382 --> 25:51.954
something to live for.

25:51.989 --> 25:54.891
So you didn't just kill
a man yesterday.

25:54.926 --> 25:56.959
Do you understand me?

25:56.994 --> 25:59.192
You killed hope.

25:59.227 --> 26:02.635
And it's my job to get it back
because this,

26:02.670 --> 26:04.296
this is my town.

26:04.331 --> 26:08.069
And these people, good or bad,
wise, greedy, whatever they are,

26:08.104 --> 26:10.071
doesn't matter.

26:10.106 --> 26:12.711
They're my people.

26:12.746 --> 26:18.981
So, I want you to confess
to the whole town.

26:19.016 --> 26:23.249
And if you do, I'll ask the
magistrate to save your life.

26:23.284 --> 26:25.119
But if you don't,

26:25.154 --> 26:29.057
I will prove in court
that you are a killer.

26:29.092 --> 26:32.027
And when they hang you,

26:32.062 --> 26:34.865
I'll be the man
who strings you up.

26:34.900 --> 26:37.032
You understand me?

27:33.222 --> 27:35.057
When will you have the funeral?

27:35.092 --> 27:37.455
- Soon.

27:37.490 --> 27:40.964
So what?
Until then, he just stays here?

27:40.999 --> 27:44.803
- I'll take him outside
if it starts to stink.

27:44.838 --> 27:47.168
He's a man, not an "it."

27:47.203 --> 27:48.774
Robert Dunnigan is gone.

27:48.809 --> 27:53.273
Now, what's right there
is just a heap of flesh.

27:57.851 --> 27:59.884
What's the matter?

28:01.118 --> 28:04.757
He just seems so much smaller

28:04.792 --> 28:06.792
than when he was alive.

28:06.827 --> 28:10.290
It's like he's shrunken.

29:00.474 --> 29:01.979
Finally.

29:03.576 --> 29:05.543
Horses all right?

29:05.578 --> 29:08.546
They're quiet.

29:08.581 --> 29:11.186
It's just that...

29:11.221 --> 29:14.123
he...

29:14.158 --> 29:17.357
that man...

29:18.063 --> 29:20.030
...his horse.

29:20.065 --> 29:22.065
He left me his horse.

29:22.100 --> 29:23.836
And his saddle.

29:23.871 --> 29:28.104
So how could it be the one
that killed Robert Dunnigan?

29:28.139 --> 29:30.007
How'd he get there
with no horse?

29:32.374 --> 29:35.276
You ask a fine question, Violet.

29:37.049 --> 29:38.510
But maybe a better question is,

29:38.545 --> 29:41.183
how'd he get a hold
of a dead man's gold?

29:41.218 --> 29:44.351
I just have a feeling.
I can't say --

29:44.386 --> 29:46.991
O'- What does your
feeling say about my face?

29:47.026 --> 29:48.619
Jimmy's arm?

29:48.654 --> 29:50.522
My arm is fine.

29:52.658 --> 29:56.066
There'll be a trial,
or he'll confess.

29:59.434 --> 30:01.940
Thank you for coming by, Violet.

30:28.936 --> 30:30.903
I'm going to go
visit the prisoner.

30:34.403 --> 30:36.403
Um...

30:36.438 --> 30:38.372
I'll go.

30:38.407 --> 30:41.507
You don't feel for it
the same way I do.

30:41.542 --> 30:44.279
Preaching is one thing,
but ministering,

30:44.314 --> 30:46.314
that's something else.

30:53.224 --> 30:55.455
That's Josephine.

30:56.557 --> 30:59.525
You know, she could use
a little ministering, too.

30:59.560 --> 31:04.167
What she could use is a father.

31:04.202 --> 31:06.565
Or someone like that
to look up to.

31:10.043 --> 31:11.669
Well...

31:13.310 --> 31:15.442
Yeah. Yes, dear.

31:24.585 --> 31:27.289
- You shouldn't be
shooting at graves.

31:27.324 --> 31:28.686
Ain't like I'm hitting it.

31:28.721 --> 31:30.424
- That's because
you're trying too hard.

31:30.459 --> 31:32.195
Getting ready for
the gun to fire.

31:32.230 --> 31:34.131
Thinking about the violence.

31:34.166 --> 31:38.234
It is violent. It's a rifle.

31:38.269 --> 31:40.434
On this end.

31:40.469 --> 31:43.140
Not on this one.

31:43.175 --> 31:45.109
What do you know about guns?

31:46.607 --> 31:49.047
You get to quiet those hands,
come on.

31:49.082 --> 31:50.477
Tuck it in there.

31:54.483 --> 31:58.749
And don't hold your breath

31:58.784 --> 32:00.685
when you're getting
ready to shoot.

32:00.720 --> 32:02.192
All right?

32:04.361 --> 32:06.625
Don't let the violence
unsettle you.

32:06.660 --> 32:10.299
Just pulled you forward
and ruins your aim, okay?

32:16.175 --> 32:19.704
Ain't there's somewhere better
around here we can shoot?

32:19.739 --> 32:22.707
That man killed my father.

32:29.056 --> 32:31.419
Go ahead, then.

32:34.457 --> 32:36.259
Now do like I told you.

32:44.665 --> 32:47.039
Let's set 'em up.

32:50.308 --> 32:53.738
O'- Violet?

32:53.773 --> 32:55.707
Sheriff says for you
to come with us.

32:55.742 --> 32:59.117
Bring a horse for her
to ride back on and a mule.

33:01.352 --> 33:04.287
-Doesn't belong to you.
-Oh. Sorry.

33:11.329 --> 33:14.099
Ah. Mrs. Murphy.

33:14.134 --> 33:15.628
Good afternoon, Sheriff.

33:15.663 --> 33:17.498
I came to pray
with the prisoner.

33:17.533 --> 33:21.700
Ah, well, never heard of a man
confessing on a full stomach,

33:21.735 --> 33:23.570
Mrs. Murphy.

33:23.605 --> 33:26.078
My mother used to say,
we pray better before a meal,

33:26.113 --> 33:28.476
but we hear God better after.

33:28.511 --> 33:32.216
Well, don't want to stand in
the way of a good prayer.

33:36.354 --> 33:38.354
-I'll be right outside.
-Mm-hmm.

33:56.803 --> 33:58.539
It's rabbit.

33:58.574 --> 34:00.244
-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

34:00.279 --> 34:02.246
Oh.

34:13.721 --> 34:16.458
What's your name?

34:16.493 --> 34:17.822
Cicero.

34:17.857 --> 34:20.693
And your family name?

34:20.728 --> 34:23.333
I have no family.

34:23.368 --> 34:25.500
Well, somebody
must have raised you.

34:27.504 --> 34:30.835
I was raised by myself.

34:30.870 --> 34:33.244
Know the wind.

34:35.380 --> 34:38.117
I go by the name I chose.

34:39.219 --> 34:41.912
Cicero.

34:41.947 --> 34:45.157
After the philosopher?

34:45.654 --> 34:47.885
It's from a play.

34:50.395 --> 34:52.593
Cicero spoke for Brutus

34:52.628 --> 34:55.728
when Mark Antony
gave his famous speech.

34:55.763 --> 35:01.437
"Friends, Romans, countrymen,
lend me your ears."

35:03.639 --> 35:05.573
He spoke for the Republic.

35:06.576 --> 35:12.250
I've thought I would like to be
the one to make that speech.

35:37.805 --> 35:40.806
- These tracks,
they're fresh.

35:40.841 --> 35:42.577
Somebody's been here.

35:42.612 --> 35:43.941
You stay back.

35:43.976 --> 35:45.745
Ain't no telling
what we're going to find.

35:59.024 --> 36:00.958
You stay here, Jimmy.

36:00.993 --> 36:04.434
I ain't staying here.

36:04.469 --> 36:07.371
I don't need your pa
thinking I got you killed.

36:10.409 --> 36:12.343
I could be the one
that saves your life.

36:12.378 --> 36:13.674
Oh, shit.

36:14.842 --> 36:16.611
Get down!

36:29.428 --> 36:30.823
How are we going to
get down there?

36:30.858 --> 36:32.528
I don't know.

36:32.563 --> 36:35.300
Mrs. Dunnigan!

36:35.335 --> 36:36.961
Mrs. Dunnigan!

36:37.832 --> 36:40.437
Is that you shoot at us?

36:40.472 --> 36:42.967
- What are you doing here?

36:43.002 --> 36:44.804
Come to take you to town.

36:44.839 --> 36:47.378
- Why you got your guns out?

36:50.614 --> 36:52.581
Somebody killed your husband.

37:19.478 --> 37:21.005
O'- Violet!

37:21.480 --> 37:23.843
Violet, where you gone?

37:38.596 --> 37:41.762
- I told him we should
leave, but he wouldn't listen.

37:44.404 --> 37:47.031
All he cared about...

37:51.070 --> 37:53.642
Now what am I supposed to do?

37:57.010 --> 37:59.747
Pa said he was supposed to
take you back to town.

37:59.782 --> 38:01.980
Got the man
who did it in jail there.

38:02.015 --> 38:07.392
I don't -- I don't want
to go to town.

38:07.427 --> 38:10.725
Everybody looking at me,
wondering about me.

38:12.828 --> 38:15.400
Him dead. All that gold. I...

38:20.066 --> 38:23.408
I want to get as far away
from this place as I can.

38:24.477 --> 38:26.708
It seems like you can do
anything you want now,

38:26.743 --> 38:28.072
Ms. Dunnigan.

38:28.107 --> 38:30.811
It is an evil place.

38:31.979 --> 38:33.715
Cruel.

38:37.787 --> 38:41.151
When does the stage leave?
I want to be on it and...

38:41.186 --> 38:44.022
never come back.

38:44.057 --> 38:46.662
Mail comes in a couple of days.

38:51.867 --> 38:54.439
Let's pack the mule.

39:25.670 --> 39:27.164
- So sad.

39:34.976 --> 39:37.779
His name is Cicero.

39:37.814 --> 39:41.948
He named himself after
a character in "Julius Caesar."

39:41.983 --> 39:43.213
He said he wanted
to give a speech,

39:43.248 --> 39:47.459
but his speech happens
off stage.

39:47.494 --> 39:49.428
-Off stage?
-Mm-hmm.

39:50.992 --> 39:55.764
He took a beating.
He was thirsty and hungry.

39:55.799 --> 39:57.964
Man's in jail for murder.

39:57.999 --> 40:01.770
I know, but they way he speaks,
it's more like a teacher

40:01.805 --> 40:04.905
than a man that you would expect
to see behind bars.

40:04.940 --> 40:06.775
I just can't believe
that he is the one

40:06.810 --> 40:09.811
who killed Robert Dunnigan.

40:09.846 --> 40:11.615
I looked right into his eyes.

40:11.650 --> 40:12.979
Now, now.

40:13.014 --> 40:15.553
Just because a man
looks innocent...

40:17.150 --> 40:21.526
does not make it so.

40:22.155 --> 40:26.828
Well, believing God is real
doesn't make it so either.

40:26.863 --> 40:29.061
But it is so.

40:36.741 --> 40:40.875
I talked to him. That killer.

40:41.944 --> 40:44.043
I need to think
he's going to hang.

40:44.078 --> 40:45.946
He deserves much worse
than hanging.

40:45.981 --> 40:47.684
You wouldn't think that
if it were any man

40:47.719 --> 40:49.081
other than Dunnigan.

40:49.116 --> 40:50.885
But it was. Dunnigan.

40:50.920 --> 40:55.956
I know he was never going to
leave his wife and marry me.

40:55.991 --> 40:59.630
But he would have given me
some of that gold.

40:59.665 --> 41:02.831
I could have sent Josephine
to a good school,

41:02.866 --> 41:05.196
where she'd grow up proper.

41:05.231 --> 41:07.033
I would have kept
any gold he gave me.

41:07.068 --> 41:08.199
She's not blood to you.

41:08.234 --> 41:10.234
- She's as good as blood.

41:10.269 --> 41:13.204
I made her father promise.

41:13.239 --> 41:15.778
And I always keep my promises.

41:18.849 --> 41:22.719
One day, the children
I take care of will be grown.

41:23.150 --> 41:26.657
They'll have lives and families.

41:26.692 --> 41:30.122
And I will have done something
with my life I can be proud of.

41:45.304 --> 41:49.273
Edgar says what happened
in the Dakotas changed her,

41:49.308 --> 41:52.617
that she's not entirely
of this world no more.

41:52.652 --> 41:57.215
Violet has been through a lot.
She deserves our respect.

44:02.342 --> 44:04.848
What's he going to do?

44:04.883 --> 44:07.444
Best get ready to
pay up, Harding.

44:09.888 --> 44:12.790
Feeling handy, are ya?

44:14.222 --> 44:17.762
I'll parlay.

44:17.797 --> 44:19.258
Oh, hell.

44:27.169 --> 44:28.905
Shit.

44:33.846 --> 44:35.274
Let's go upstairs.

45:17.054 --> 45:19.087
Evening, Ms. Dunnigan.

45:21.927 --> 45:23.454
Everybody's looking at me.

45:23.489 --> 45:26.523
You -- you just hold
your head high.

45:26.558 --> 45:30.527
They'll be looking at you
wherever you go.

45:30.562 --> 45:33.167
Josephine, can you get us
some silver, please?

45:36.139 --> 45:38.909
-Thank you.
-Evening, Ms. Dunnigan.

45:38.944 --> 45:40.471
Evening.

45:44.015 --> 45:47.544
So, uh, are you, uh...

45:47.579 --> 45:49.414
Are you comfortable
in your room?

45:49.449 --> 45:51.218
It's fine.

45:52.320 --> 45:55.057
Anything that you -- that you
need, anything that you want,

45:55.092 --> 45:58.489
just you can tell Jimmy, my son,
here, and, uh...

46:02.132 --> 46:04.561
- I'm truly sorry about
what happened to --

46:04.596 --> 46:07.036
to your husband, Mrs. Dunnigan.

46:07.236 --> 46:11.106
He -- he was a wild man,

46:11.141 --> 46:14.076
but a good one in
the ways that matter.

46:16.212 --> 46:19.147
And you can be sure
that whoever did this

46:19.182 --> 46:21.545
will pay a very dear price.

46:24.990 --> 46:27.188
Which one of them
was his favorite?

46:29.456 --> 46:32.930
He always came back from town
smelling like perfume.

46:32.965 --> 46:35.460
Always the same scent.

46:35.495 --> 46:39.871
Everyone has his faults,
Mrs. Dunnigan.

46:39.906 --> 46:44.370
But some of them have qualities
that redeem them, too.

46:45.670 --> 46:47.505
I think that when a man
passes on,

46:47.540 --> 46:49.474
it's best to remember
his better nature.

46:49.509 --> 46:50.849
Don't you think?

46:53.645 --> 46:56.151
Just...

46:56.186 --> 46:58.285
the first thing he did when
he found that gold

46:58.320 --> 47:02.652
was run off to town, and I...

47:02.687 --> 47:06.029
I keep thinking if -- it he'd
stayed there with me,

47:06.064 --> 47:09.593
he might still be alive.

47:10.233 --> 47:12.299
Yeah.

47:57.346 --> 47:58.675
- Violet?

47:59.447 --> 48:01.920
- I'm sorry.

48:05.288 --> 48:11.358
That man, the one they
have in jail,

48:11.393 --> 48:13.558
he's not this man's killer.

48:17.333 --> 48:19.729
I found this.

48:19.764 --> 48:21.500
- What is it?

48:30.214 --> 48:32.984
Man who loves her wrote this.

48:42.754 --> 48:45.590
He'll send an innocent man
to the gallows.

48:45.625 --> 48:48.098
Mrs. Dunnigan has a lover.

48:48.133 --> 48:50.100
Thaddeus.

49:09.286 --> 49:12.419
Little late for a visit,
ain't it?

49:31.803 --> 49:35.046
Marie Laveau.

49:35.081 --> 49:38.742
She's a voodoo queen. Hm?

49:39.712 --> 49:42.185
Black magic.

49:42.220 --> 49:44.781
Sign of the devil.

49:44.816 --> 49:48.587
You know its name,
but not what it beckons.

49:48.622 --> 49:51.062
It never conjured Satan for me.

49:52.197 --> 49:54.131
Then why'd they beat you up?

49:54.166 --> 49:55.759
O'- Think it
ain't Christian

49:55.794 --> 49:57.695
to punish someone like that?

49:57.730 --> 49:59.466
Killed a man.

50:02.867 --> 50:05.505
He's a murderer, preacher.

50:05.540 --> 50:10.081
When I'm sheriff, a man like him
be hanging from a rope already.

50:14.648 --> 50:17.451
Did you kill him?

50:17.486 --> 50:21.158
Robert Dunnigan.

50:21.193 --> 50:22.852
Did you?

50:22.887 --> 50:25.756
I say I am innocent.

50:25.791 --> 50:29.133
I saw that man celebrating when
he found his gold.

50:29.168 --> 50:31.795
The saloon keeper was generous
with his whiskey.

50:31.830 --> 50:34.336
Maybe because I had money.

50:34.371 --> 50:38.241
Maybe because we both know
the plays of Shakespeare.

50:38.276 --> 50:41.838
And I could not keep
my eyes open.

50:41.873 --> 50:44.209
I was lucky to make it
back to my bed.

50:48.286 --> 50:50.517
You talk like an educated man.

51:06.535 --> 51:09.140
Ah, good evening, preacher.

51:10.209 --> 51:13.474
I just came to offer
my condolences.

51:13.509 --> 51:16.609
It's a tragic thing,
Ms. Dunnigan,

51:16.644 --> 51:19.381
what happened to your husband.

51:19.416 --> 51:21.878
Tragic.

51:21.913 --> 51:24.452
This was his.

51:24.487 --> 51:26.718
I thought to return it to you.

51:27.853 --> 51:29.754
Thank you.

51:33.463 --> 51:38.499
I-I see the grave's dug.
Are you going to bury him soon?

51:38.534 --> 51:42.833
Oh, uh, whenever you wish,
ma'am.

51:42.868 --> 51:47.376
I want to leave when
the mail stage comes.

51:49.545 --> 51:51.644
We can bury him tomorrow.

51:51.679 --> 51:55.582
Are you, uh...are you leaving
for good then, Mrs. Dunnigan?

51:59.258 --> 52:03.821
This was my husband's place,
not mine.

52:05.264 --> 52:07.858
Yeah, I can sell the claim.

52:07.893 --> 52:10.465
I know that, and...

52:10.500 --> 52:14.304
go some place, see if I can
ever feel human again.

52:14.339 --> 52:15.833
I want to go. I'm sorry.

52:15.868 --> 52:17.868
Jimmy. Jimmy, you stand
outside the boarding house,

52:17.903 --> 52:19.573
make sure nobody gets in.

52:19.608 --> 52:21.476
Just so that you have
a safe sleep, Mrs. Dunnigan.

52:21.511 --> 52:22.774
Thank you, Sheriff.

52:22.809 --> 52:24.974
Preacher. Good night.

52:25.009 --> 52:27.251
Ma'am.

52:30.949 --> 52:35.490
Soon as fortune smiles upon him,
tragedy strikes.

52:37.560 --> 52:40.594
You, uh, care to have
a drink with me?

52:51.343 --> 52:52.705
Where'd you get this?

52:52.740 --> 52:54.608
Violet.

52:54.643 --> 52:57.743
She found it at
Dunnigan's shack.

52:57.778 --> 52:59.679
Hmm.

52:59.714 --> 53:02.946
You're trying to take my job
from me, are you, Preacher?

53:02.981 --> 53:06.521
You don't see me
jumping into the pulpit.

53:06.556 --> 53:11.526
Well, my job would be
to seek the truth, Sheriff.

53:11.990 --> 53:15.464
Whether or not that leads you
to what you think you'll find.

53:16.830 --> 53:20.700
Well, my truth is that the men
that I have in that jail

53:20.735 --> 53:23.769
over there is the man who
killed Robert Dunnigan.

53:23.804 --> 53:25.507
Yeah.

53:25.542 --> 53:28.972
But he doesn't seem like
a murderer, does he?

53:31.647 --> 53:36.485
Well, why don't you
have a real drink, preacher?

53:36.520 --> 53:39.587
No, no.

53:39.622 --> 53:43.360
Don't drink.
I'll take some sugar, though.

53:43.395 --> 53:45.527
Thank you, Josephine.

53:46.761 --> 53:49.696
You know, a few years back,
there was a land dispute,

53:49.731 --> 53:51.632
left one man dead,
and the accused

53:51.667 --> 53:54.734
was a man called William McCoy.

53:56.067 --> 53:59.673
Well, anyway,
I had to bring them in.

53:59.708 --> 54:01.873
He was nice, man.

54:01.908 --> 54:04.447
And, um, I didn't know much
about being a law man

54:04.482 --> 54:05.580
at that time.

54:05.615 --> 54:06.779
I was just out of the army.

54:06.814 --> 54:08.550
But I got to like it.

54:08.585 --> 54:14.391
Again, thinking to myself,
maybe -- maybe it wasn't murder.

54:14.426 --> 54:18.461
Maybe it was an accident.
Maybe he's not guilty.

54:18.496 --> 54:22.333
Anyway, one night,
my wife was bringing over

54:22.368 --> 54:25.798
some supper at the jail,
and I'd let him out of his cell.

54:25.833 --> 54:27.932
We were playing cards.

54:27.967 --> 54:32.475
And he took advantage of
the situation to go for my gun.

54:32.510 --> 54:34.411
And it went off.

54:34.446 --> 54:38.107
And I grabbed him, and I...

54:38.142 --> 54:43.552
I, uh, took out
my other pistol and...

54:43.587 --> 54:45.081
I shot him.

54:47.756 --> 54:56.829
What I didn't realize when
all the mayhem had calmed down

54:56.864 --> 54:58.567
was that my wife was lying
on the floor

54:58.602 --> 55:00.701
with a bullet in her chest.

55:02.672 --> 55:06.344
I went over to her,
and I took her in my arms.

55:09.041 --> 55:12.042
I tried to talk to her
and bring her back, but...

55:14.684 --> 55:16.651
But she was gone.

55:18.886 --> 55:24.021
So what I'm saying is that
I know that that man over there

55:24.056 --> 55:26.122
is the man who killed
Robert Dunnigan,

55:26.157 --> 55:29.631
and I will not let him go
just because he doesn't

55:29.666 --> 55:32.700
seem like a killer, preacher.

55:51.919 --> 55:53.457
Everything quiet?

55:53.492 --> 55:55.789
Yeah. No one going in,
no one coming out.

55:58.464 --> 56:02.928
Violet Running Horse went out
to the Dunnigan place.

56:02.963 --> 56:05.029
Why did she do that?

56:05.064 --> 56:10.870
She, uh -- she found a letter,
kind of love letter.

56:10.905 --> 56:15.105
Guess someone's trying to get
close to Mrs. Dunnigan.

56:15.140 --> 56:16.777
I want you to keep
your eyes peeled

56:16.812 --> 56:18.845
just in case she shows up here.

56:22.554 --> 56:24.081
I will.

57:12.263 --> 57:14.637
I have a warm heart,
comfortable bed.

57:14.672 --> 57:17.805
Both in need of company.

57:17.840 --> 57:20.841
If you want me in a bed,
you know where to find me.

57:20.876 --> 57:22.579
And how much it'll cost you.

57:26.981 --> 57:28.750
Good night, Harding.

57:28.785 --> 57:30.785
Go to hell, Wilcox.

59:10.084 --> 59:12.018
Ah! Ah!

59:55.096 --> 59:56.733
Oh, I love you, Rebecca.

59:56.768 --> 59:58.130
Oh, yeah.

1:00:03.874 --> 1:00:05.203
More of that, yeah.

1:00:05.238 --> 1:00:07.645
Whoo, whoo.

1:00:08.175 --> 1:00:11.044
Mm, shit. Oh, shit.

1:00:15.050 --> 1:00:16.852
Whoo.

1:00:55.354 --> 1:00:56.892
O'- Come on, Jimmy.
Let's saddle up.

1:00:56.927 --> 1:00:58.421
- Preacher.

1:00:58.456 --> 1:01:01.325
Didn't seem like
he was a killer?

1:01:01.360 --> 1:01:04.493
Why don't you go in the livery
and see what he did?

1:01:04.528 --> 1:01:09.135
And while you're at it,
dig another grave.

1:01:10.072 --> 1:01:12.270
Come on, let's go.

1:01:42.335 --> 1:01:44.137
Hyah, hyah.

1:01:57.284 --> 1:02:00.989
You know me and Edgar first
found Violet in the Dakotas.

1:02:01.024 --> 1:02:03.926
We was moving west ourselves.

1:02:09.164 --> 1:02:15.069
Her band had been killed by our
soldiers, slaughtered.

1:02:16.567 --> 1:02:20.305
All of them, just plumb through
the last frail elder.

1:02:21.539 --> 1:02:25.013
So we dug them graves.

1:02:25.048 --> 1:02:27.279
To lay them to rest
with dignity.

1:02:29.415 --> 1:02:33.824
I lifted her to put her
in the ground, and they, Lord,

1:02:33.859 --> 1:02:37.828
I felt her heart was far away.

1:02:37.863 --> 1:02:40.864
Like she was already gone.

1:02:40.899 --> 1:02:43.097
It's coming from
the other side of death.

1:02:45.596 --> 1:02:50.467
Do you think death does that
when people get too close?

1:02:52.471 --> 1:02:56.275
Leave a fine layer
of dust on 'em?

1:02:57.476 --> 1:03:00.279
- But I thought of her
as my daughter.

1:03:00.314 --> 1:03:02.248
You know, we never had
a child of our own,

1:03:02.283 --> 1:03:06.483
and it just made me so happy
to see her with them horses.

1:03:10.423 --> 1:03:14.194
Gonna come go bury in
the cemetery, won't you?

1:03:14.229 --> 1:03:17.329
Like a Christian.

1:03:17.364 --> 1:03:19.265
I didn't know she was one.

1:03:22.501 --> 1:03:25.337
Then again...

1:03:25.372 --> 1:03:28.010
I don't know no one who is.

1:03:28.045 --> 1:03:30.144
Not really.

1:03:31.378 --> 1:03:34.115
We'll bury her.

1:03:34.150 --> 1:03:35.479
Okay?

1:03:35.514 --> 1:03:38.515
I just want to see
your grave, preacher.

1:03:38.550 --> 1:03:42.926
Plenty of flowers alongside
of their graves.

1:03:45.964 --> 1:03:49.229
Okay, sweetie.

1:03:49.264 --> 1:03:52.100
He's gonna get you right now.

1:04:13.354 --> 1:04:15.618
Hey, Josephine. There you are.

1:04:15.653 --> 1:04:18.192
I've been looking
high and low for you.

1:04:18.227 --> 1:04:20.260
It's Violet.

1:04:26.103 --> 1:04:28.334
That killer's free.

1:04:28.369 --> 1:04:30.501
So none of us is safe.

1:04:33.176 --> 1:04:34.637
Do you understand me?

1:04:34.672 --> 1:04:36.276
Si, tia.

1:04:49.225 --> 1:04:50.686
Let's go.

1:04:55.198 --> 1:04:56.527
Hyah!

1:04:59.169 --> 1:05:00.663
Hyah!

1:05:05.043 --> 1:05:07.010
Hyah, hyah!

1:05:30.662 --> 1:05:31.969
Hyah!

1:05:57.095 --> 1:05:59.425
Hyah!

1:06:13.408 --> 1:06:15.111
What happened?

1:06:15.146 --> 1:06:16.640
He escaped.

1:06:20.580 --> 1:06:22.283
Thank you.

1:06:25.849 --> 1:06:28.553
But she was the one
that thought he was innocent.

1:06:28.588 --> 1:06:30.687
She was the one
that found the letter.

1:06:30.722 --> 1:06:32.788
- Yeah. I don't know.

1:06:32.823 --> 1:06:35.065
Maybe he tried
to get his horse back.

1:06:35.100 --> 1:06:37.166
She tried to stop him.

1:06:40.105 --> 1:06:43.403
Why would she do that?

1:06:43.438 --> 1:06:45.834
I don't know.

1:06:45.869 --> 1:06:50.542
I don't know that he killed her,
and I don't know that he didn't.

1:06:52.744 --> 1:06:54.447
Well, what are you
going to do?

1:06:54.482 --> 1:06:57.285
-What am I going to do?
-Mm-hmm.

1:06:57.320 --> 1:07:00.321
I'm going to build a coffin.

1:07:00.356 --> 1:07:02.554
I'm going to dig another grave.

1:07:02.589 --> 1:07:04.622
And I'm gonna put her in it.

1:07:04.855 --> 1:07:09.627
And I am going to pray
for her soul to Heaven.

1:07:12.830 --> 1:07:15.138
Was anyone standing guard?

1:07:15.173 --> 1:07:17.701
Yeah. O'Sullivan.

1:07:17.736 --> 1:07:19.472
Wasn't doing his job.

1:07:19.507 --> 1:07:21.144
Well, is he still alive?

1:07:23.676 --> 1:07:26.281
Why would he leave alive a man
who would chase him down

1:07:26.316 --> 1:07:29.449
and then kill a woman
who tried to set him free?

1:07:32.619 --> 1:07:35.356
That would be the sheriff's job.

1:07:35.391 --> 1:07:41.329
My job is to look after
the souls of this town.

1:07:41.364 --> 1:07:43.793
Thaddeus Murphy.

1:07:43.828 --> 1:07:46.532
God put us here for a reason.

1:08:01.714 --> 1:08:07.223
And now a prayer for
Robert Dunnigan.

1:09:03.743 --> 1:09:05.974
Sheriff, he ain't got no horse,
and I hit him.

1:09:06.009 --> 1:09:07.712
I know I hit him, Sheriff.

1:09:07.747 --> 1:09:10.649
Sheriff, are we going to head
back out at dawn?

1:09:11.289 --> 1:09:14.719
Sheriff, Sheriff,
is this necessary?

1:09:14.754 --> 1:09:16.787
-You let him escape.
-Please.

1:09:16.822 --> 1:09:18.921
Now you're going to
take his place.

1:09:18.956 --> 1:09:21.264
Come on.

1:09:21.299 --> 1:09:23.365
Look, Jim.

1:09:26.568 --> 1:09:27.963
Dammit!

1:10:01.405 --> 1:10:06.771
We brought that tune with us
from inglorious South.

1:10:06.806 --> 1:10:10.940
And singing together for her.

1:10:13.076 --> 1:10:17.650
We made friends
out of former enemies.

1:10:17.685 --> 1:10:22.787
That was the miracle of
the Montana territory.

1:10:23.856 --> 1:10:26.461
He used to sing it to her.

1:10:27.530 --> 1:10:29.860
I used to watch him.

1:10:29.895 --> 1:10:31.895
She loved it.

1:10:34.735 --> 1:10:36.636
That was a real love.

1:10:53.424 --> 1:10:58.526
Josephine, when you going to
start working like you're prone?

1:10:58.561 --> 1:11:00.594
I ain't.

1:11:00.629 --> 1:11:03.795
Bet you'd be just
as good as her.

1:11:03.830 --> 1:11:05.566
I ain't, Harding.

1:11:05.601 --> 1:11:07.931
Oh, you hear that, Isabel?

1:11:07.966 --> 1:11:10.868
Your little stray cat thinks
she's better than you are.

1:11:10.903 --> 1:11:13.970
She'll see there ain't
no better life than this.

1:11:14.005 --> 1:11:18.447
Besides, who's going to marry,
coming from a place like this?

1:11:18.482 --> 1:11:21.648
Watch your filthy mouth.

1:11:21.683 --> 1:11:23.716
Is that right?

1:11:23.751 --> 1:11:25.047
You heard me.

1:11:25.082 --> 1:11:28.391
You gonna get me straight,
preacher man?

1:11:28.426 --> 1:11:30.690
Believe if I wanted to be told
what to do by you,

1:11:30.725 --> 1:11:32.725
I'd find myself in church.

1:11:32.760 --> 1:11:35.860
Besides, we're all just having
a big time.

1:11:35.895 --> 1:11:39.831
Who else is going to teach young
Josephine how to whore, huh?

1:11:41.406 --> 1:11:43.703
You leave Josephine out of this.

1:11:43.738 --> 1:11:45.969
She's just a kid.

1:11:46.004 --> 1:11:49.511
What happened to her daddy
is not her fault.

1:11:49.546 --> 1:11:51.579
Now, why don't you just do
what the preacher says

1:11:51.614 --> 1:11:53.911
and shut your goddamn mouth?

1:11:58.181 --> 1:12:00.357
You join me in a drink?

1:12:01.987 --> 1:12:05.626
You know, Sheriff, maybe I will.

1:12:06.794 --> 1:12:09.498
That man was no prisoner
that got way.

1:12:12.195 --> 1:12:15.636
Edgar, I'm so sorry about
what happened to Violet.

1:12:17.640 --> 1:12:19.376
We're all sorry.

1:12:25.780 --> 1:12:28.143
Gentlemen.

1:12:28.178 --> 1:12:29.617
To grace.

1:12:29.652 --> 1:12:32.389
-To grace.
-To grace.

1:12:33.491 --> 1:12:36.525
Sometimes it seems like
a very long way away.

1:12:36.890 --> 1:12:38.791
- Hm.

1:12:49.067 --> 1:12:51.100
You smell like whiskey.

1:13:46.861 --> 1:13:49.697
What was that?

1:13:55.100 --> 1:13:57.969
Stay here.

1:14:03.911 --> 1:14:07.517
Anybody comes in here
that's not me, you shoot 'em.

1:14:07.552 --> 1:14:09.717
I can't shoot a man.

1:14:09.752 --> 1:14:13.754
It's just like shooting
a rabbit, only easier to hit.

1:14:30.102 --> 1:14:31.607
Alice!

1:14:31.642 --> 1:14:33.774
Give me a rag.

1:14:38.011 --> 1:14:40.011
Aah!

1:14:42.620 --> 1:14:44.884
Where did you learn
how to do that?

1:15:52.921 --> 1:15:54.591
What are you doing?

1:15:56.386 --> 1:15:58.353
Thaddeus! Answer me.

1:16:00.027 --> 1:16:02.159
Those guns of his are
Peacemakers.

1:16:02.194 --> 1:16:04.029
Why are you digging?

1:16:04.064 --> 1:16:06.361
The bullet that killed
Robert Dunnigan

1:16:06.396 --> 1:16:09.199
is still his body.

1:16:09.234 --> 1:16:13.643
And if enough from a Peacemaker,
I can clear his name.

1:16:13.678 --> 1:16:16.404
And we won't be harboring
a fugitive.

1:17:26.916 --> 1:17:28.751
What are you doing here?

1:17:35.122 --> 1:17:37.859
Por favor. Andale.

1:17:37.894 --> 1:17:39.091
It's late, Jimmy.

1:17:39.126 --> 1:17:40.829
Vaya.

1:17:47.233 --> 1:17:49.068
Good.

1:18:04.547 --> 1:18:06.481
But be quick.

1:18:07.253 --> 1:18:09.088
And quiet.

1:18:32.476 --> 1:18:34.377
Andale.

1:18:54.465 --> 1:18:56.102
Jimmy.

1:18:56.137 --> 1:18:58.907
Jimmy, Jimmy!

1:19:00.603 --> 1:19:01.976
Jimmy!

1:19:44.515 --> 1:19:47.120
Isabel, is that you?

1:19:50.059 --> 1:19:51.553
Edgar.

1:19:54.030 --> 1:19:55.326
Edgar?

1:19:55.361 --> 1:19:57.097
I'll go.

1:19:57.132 --> 1:19:59.528
- Isabel, it's little late
to be knocking boots.

1:19:59.563 --> 1:20:02.531
Stubborn old
son of a bitch.

1:20:17.350 --> 1:20:20.186
No, no, no, no!

1:20:21.486 --> 1:20:23.926
Dear sweet Edgar!

1:20:27.195 --> 1:20:28.458
-Jimmy?
-Oh, shit.

1:20:28.493 --> 1:20:30.526
Uh...

1:20:32.002 --> 1:20:33.034
Oh, shit.

1:20:33.069 --> 1:20:34.398
Huh?

1:20:34.433 --> 1:20:35.465
What happened?

1:20:35.500 --> 1:20:37.940
- I did it. I did it.

1:20:37.975 --> 1:20:39.601
Just like he told me to do it.

1:20:39.636 --> 1:20:42.010
I did it, and it's done.

1:20:42.045 --> 1:20:43.880
It's done.

1:20:48.513 --> 1:20:50.315
Edgar was there.

1:20:50.350 --> 1:20:52.581
-Did he see you?
-No.

1:20:54.387 --> 1:20:58.961
But she did -- she was --

1:20:58.996 --> 1:21:01.425
She was looking right
into my eyes.

1:21:01.460 --> 1:21:03.196
Geez, I've known her since
I was a kid,

1:21:03.231 --> 1:21:05.099
and she's the only other person

1:21:05.134 --> 1:21:06.430
I've ever been with
before I met you.

1:21:06.465 --> 1:21:09.136
Hey.

1:21:09.171 --> 1:21:12.205
When you met me,

1:21:12.240 --> 1:21:14.438
in every way.

1:21:15.144 --> 1:21:17.243
Come here.

1:21:20.050 --> 1:21:23.480
You are --
You are a man of action.

1:21:25.451 --> 1:21:28.089
Yeah. You know.

1:21:30.753 --> 1:21:33.996
What happens now?
What about Josephine?

1:21:34.031 --> 1:21:36.460
What is she going to do
without her mom?

1:21:41.203 --> 1:21:43.236
It's done now.

1:21:43.271 --> 1:21:46.470
Yeah. Yeah, it's done.

1:21:46.505 --> 1:21:48.439
As long as they don't catch me
and hang me from a tree.

1:21:48.474 --> 1:21:51.981
Hey, shh.
Your daddy is never...

1:21:52.016 --> 1:21:57.613
He's never gonna think his own
boy would do these things, huh?

1:22:01.355 --> 1:22:05.588
Now, tomorrow noon, I'm going to
be on that coach.

1:22:05.623 --> 1:22:07.491
And what are you going
to tell your daddy, hm?

1:22:07.526 --> 1:22:09.031
I'm gonna tell him
that I'm gonna go out

1:22:09.066 --> 1:22:10.494
and make a life for myself.

1:22:10.529 --> 1:22:11.561
-Yeah.
-Out on my own.

1:22:11.596 --> 1:22:13.530
-Mm-hmm.

1:22:14.698 --> 1:22:17.204
And then what
are you going to do?

1:22:17.239 --> 1:22:19.602
-I'm going to come find you.
-Uh-huh.

1:22:19.637 --> 1:22:21.175
-You.
-Yeah.

1:22:21.210 --> 1:22:22.671
Yeah.

1:22:22.706 --> 1:22:25.344
And we're going to be
together, huh?

1:22:25.379 --> 1:22:28.050
Yeah. Yeah.

1:22:34.487 --> 1:22:37.785
You should --
You should have left already.

1:22:37.820 --> 1:22:41.030
I told you should have
left already. I told you.

1:22:41.065 --> 1:22:44.660
I got to leave on that stage,
or people are going to wonder.

1:22:44.695 --> 1:22:46.497
Now you listen to me.

1:22:46.532 --> 1:22:48.763
Jimmy, you're going to come
later, and you're not going to

1:22:48.798 --> 1:22:51.799
tell anybody what we done.

1:22:51.834 --> 1:22:53.768
You hear me?

1:22:53.803 --> 1:22:55.671
Look at me.

1:23:02.713 --> 1:23:05.714
Come here, Jimmy.

1:23:05.749 --> 1:23:07.749
We're gonna be happy.

1:23:10.721 --> 1:23:15.394
We're going to have more gold
than you could spend

1:23:15.429 --> 1:23:17.528
in 10 lifetimes.

1:23:17.563 --> 1:23:19.101
Yeah.

1:23:19.862 --> 1:23:25.470
And we'll go someplace where
nobody knows who we are.

1:23:25.505 --> 1:23:27.604
Uh-huh.

1:23:27.639 --> 1:23:34.182
Then you can have me
any time you want.

1:23:34.217 --> 1:23:37.350
Any way you want me.

1:23:53.203 --> 1:23:54.829
I know.

1:23:54.864 --> 1:23:56.336
I know you.

1:23:56.371 --> 1:23:58.701
Yeah. Uh-huh.

1:23:58.736 --> 1:24:00.472
Have some water.
Have some water, partner.

1:24:00.507 --> 1:24:02.738
-Yeah.
-Come on.

1:24:03.378 --> 1:24:05.345
He hit you right in the head.

1:24:08.713 --> 1:24:10.812
I ain't staying here.

1:24:10.847 --> 1:24:12.418
This ain't right, Edgar.

1:24:12.453 --> 1:24:13.782
Mickey.

1:24:14.356 --> 1:24:16.785
I know what you're thinking.

1:24:16.820 --> 1:24:18.655
I do.

1:24:18.690 --> 1:24:24.430
You think that we have to
say what we saw.

1:24:24.465 --> 1:24:26.696
I know it hurts you.

1:24:29.404 --> 1:24:31.305
It hurts me, too.

1:24:39.942 --> 1:24:43.185
Okay, lie down, Edgar,
and be quiet for just a second.

1:24:43.220 --> 1:24:45.286
-You know --
-No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1:24:45.321 --> 1:24:48.190
Now, you listen to me.

1:24:48.225 --> 1:24:51.325
They know about us.

1:24:51.360 --> 1:24:53.558
They do.

1:24:53.593 --> 1:24:56.165
They don't,
but they always do.

1:24:57.795 --> 1:25:02.303
And if don't say what we know
you saw...

1:25:02.338 --> 1:25:04.800
-No, no, no,
-It's not right, Edgar.

1:25:04.835 --> 1:25:08.507
We can't take on a fight
we can't win.

1:25:11.941 --> 1:25:16.614
And you know
when all this is over,

1:25:16.649 --> 1:25:20.387
we're going to have to be here

1:25:20.422 --> 1:25:23.489
when the town really needs us.

1:25:24.327 --> 1:25:25.821
Okay.

1:25:25.856 --> 1:25:27.625
Okay, old man.

1:25:30.696 --> 1:25:33.532
I'll do what I have to
do for us.

1:25:43.445 --> 1:25:45.841
You're the best.

1:25:45.876 --> 1:25:48.217
I got you, buddy.

1:25:56.755 --> 1:25:58.359
What rare you gonna do, Sheriff?

1:25:58.394 --> 1:26:01.527
Sheriff? Sheriff?

1:26:02.299 --> 1:26:04.332
Tia! Isabel!

1:26:04.367 --> 1:26:05.696
-No.
-Isabel!

1:26:05.731 --> 1:26:07.632
No, child.

1:26:07.667 --> 1:26:09.502
No!

1:26:09.537 --> 1:26:10.932
Isabel!

1:26:13.409 --> 1:26:15.508
Sheriff, come on!
Ain't I been here long?!

1:26:15.543 --> 1:26:16.806
Shut up, O'Sullivan.

1:26:16.841 --> 1:26:18.478
Are you going
to let me out here?

1:26:18.513 --> 1:26:21.448
Isabel Santos is dead,
and it's on your head.

1:26:21.483 --> 1:26:23.846
Do you understand me?

1:26:23.881 --> 1:26:25.320
Do you understand?

1:26:25.355 --> 1:26:26.486
O'- Yeah. Yeah.

1:26:26.521 --> 1:26:27.751
Yeah, I'm sorry, Sheriff.

1:26:27.786 --> 1:26:29.885
- Let him out, Jimmy.

1:26:33.627 --> 1:26:36.958
I'm going to put this killer
in the ground.

1:26:36.993 --> 1:26:40.368
And any man who rides with
me gets $20.

1:26:40.403 --> 1:26:45.472
Any man who puts a bullet in
him, gets that.

1:26:45.507 --> 1:26:47.936
And I'm going to judge
every one of you

1:26:47.971 --> 1:26:50.807
by whether you stand
with me or not.

1:26:50.842 --> 1:26:52.413
That includes you, Mickey.

1:26:52.448 --> 1:26:55.317
Me?

1:26:55.352 --> 1:26:56.681
Sheriff, look at all
the men you have.

1:26:56.716 --> 1:26:59.552
You know why
you have a place here?

1:26:59.587 --> 1:27:01.752
-Yeah, I --
-When town calls, you answer.

1:27:01.787 --> 1:27:04.425
Get a goddamn gun.

1:27:05.890 --> 1:27:08.462
What's in it for me, Sheriff?

1:27:09.432 --> 1:27:10.794
Listen, Sheriff.

1:27:13.601 --> 1:27:16.602
The smell.

1:27:16.637 --> 1:27:19.275
Ugh!

1:27:22.577 --> 1:27:24.610
I think -- I think I feel it.

1:27:25.448 --> 1:27:27.778
I'm going to need you to come
here and hold this open.

1:27:27.813 --> 1:27:28.977
What?

1:27:29.012 --> 1:27:30.517
Oh, no, no, no, I cannot.

1:27:32.851 --> 1:27:34.917
Alice...

1:27:38.593 --> 1:27:40.758
Good girl.

1:27:40.793 --> 1:27:42.430
Pull that apart.

1:27:42.465 --> 1:27:45.598
Go ahead. Just hold it open.

1:27:45.633 --> 1:27:48.865
You're going to have to dig
your fingers in there.

1:27:48.900 --> 1:27:49.932
Need you to pull it apart.

1:27:51.133 --> 1:27:52.374
-Good, good.

1:27:52.409 --> 1:27:54.035
I think I --

1:27:54.070 --> 1:27:56.807
I think feel it.

1:27:57.810 --> 1:28:00.448
-Get it.

1:28:02.947 --> 1:28:05.585
What is it? What do you see?

1:28:16.928 --> 1:28:19.401
That's not from a Peacemaker.

1:28:20.162 --> 1:28:22.338
Well...

1:28:22.604 --> 1:28:24.406
Well, how do you even know
the difference?

1:28:24.441 --> 1:28:28.905
I mean -- I mean -- I mean,
it's inside of a man's body.

1:28:30.447 --> 1:28:33.811
Thaddeus, what is going on?

1:28:33.846 --> 1:28:36.583
Thaddeus, what are you
hiding from me?

1:28:39.456 --> 1:28:40.950
Alice.

1:28:42.184 --> 1:28:46.087
There was a time

1:28:46.122 --> 1:28:48.793
not too long ago

1:28:48.828 --> 1:28:51.400
that I wore one of these.

1:28:51.435 --> 1:28:55.371
And every sin I preach against
I'm guilty of.

1:28:57.166 --> 1:28:59.573
I come to God
because I was running.

1:28:59.608 --> 1:29:01.443
Okay?

1:29:01.478 --> 1:29:04.105
I was running from the devil.

1:29:04.140 --> 1:29:08.846
Now, I left that life.

1:29:08.881 --> 1:29:12.487
The day I met you,
I left it for good.

1:29:15.558 --> 1:29:18.119
I thought I could hide.

1:29:18.154 --> 1:29:21.496
But now the devil saw me.

1:29:21.531 --> 1:29:23.399
And...

1:29:24.864 --> 1:29:26.897
...he's a coming.

1:29:32.036 --> 1:29:34.674
This was the bullet that shot
Robert Dunnigan.

1:29:34.709 --> 1:29:37.611
And I know it wasn't you
who shot him.

1:29:39.615 --> 1:29:42.176
I've known men
like your sheriff,

1:29:42.211 --> 1:29:46.719
good in their minds,
honorable, wrong,

1:29:46.754 --> 1:29:49.018
and do righteous to be right.

1:29:49.053 --> 1:29:51.790
You're safe here.
It's a church.

1:29:51.825 --> 1:29:53.528
Am I?

1:29:58.997 --> 1:30:00.095
Preacher?

1:30:03.166 --> 1:30:04.935
Hide.

1:30:08.204 --> 1:30:09.907
- Here.

1:30:17.983 --> 1:30:19.686
- Preacher?

1:30:32.063 --> 1:30:34.932
So much for your divine grace.

1:30:36.034 --> 1:30:38.672
Why her?

1:30:38.707 --> 1:30:41.103
Well, I'll be sure
to ask him when I catch him.

1:30:52.820 --> 1:30:56.052
Search every house, every camp.

1:30:56.087 --> 1:30:57.955
He's here somewhere.

1:30:57.990 --> 1:31:00.661
Move. Go.

1:32:16.365 --> 1:32:18.134
Hello, Mrs. Murphy.

1:32:20.776 --> 1:32:23.942
You doing, uh -- doing
a spot of cleaning?

1:32:23.977 --> 1:32:26.681
- I am.

1:32:27.783 --> 1:32:30.751
My instinct tells me
that there's got to be

1:32:30.786 --> 1:32:33.589
a rational explanation for this.

1:32:33.789 --> 1:32:35.756
I, uh...

1:32:36.286 --> 1:32:39.056
-Sheriff.
-I...

1:32:40.092 --> 1:32:44.831
Mind telling me why there's
a dead body on your floor?

1:32:44.866 --> 1:32:47.999
Come, sit.

1:32:48.969 --> 1:32:51.398
I asked you a question.

1:32:51.433 --> 1:32:53.906
I expect you to answer
like anybody else.

1:32:55.976 --> 1:33:00.011
I took this bullet
out of that body.

1:33:02.279 --> 1:33:05.412
I wanted to be sure
you had the right man.

1:33:05.447 --> 1:33:07.920
The prisoner
shoots a Peacemaker.

1:33:07.955 --> 1:33:11.759
That bullet came
from a Colt Navy.

1:33:20.704 --> 1:33:24.002
It takes a lot of shooting
to know one bullet from another.

1:33:26.908 --> 1:33:29.139
Your men are chasing
an innocent man.

1:33:31.407 --> 1:33:36.751
Let me tell you about justice
the way I see it.

1:33:36.786 --> 1:33:40.018
This isn't about
Robert Dunnigan.

1:33:40.053 --> 1:33:42.955
Not even about the man
who killed him.

1:33:42.990 --> 1:33:45.221
It's about everyone else.

1:33:45.256 --> 1:33:48.257
You kill a man in this town,

1:33:48.292 --> 1:33:53.064
everybody knows
there's a price to be paid.

1:33:53.099 --> 1:33:55.000
Dunnigan, what does he care?

1:33:55.035 --> 1:33:56.936
He's dead.

1:33:56.971 --> 1:34:00.236
What matters is this town.

1:34:01.437 --> 1:34:04.339
Law and order.

1:34:04.374 --> 1:34:06.748
And what about the truth?

1:34:08.345 --> 1:34:10.884
I'll do everything I need to do

1:34:10.919 --> 1:34:14.756
to ensure that justice
is seen to be done.

1:34:14.791 --> 1:34:16.417
- Uh-huh.

1:34:17.926 --> 1:34:23.358
What happens when, not if,
but when another man is killed?

1:34:24.427 --> 1:34:27.329
I'd get that body
back in the grave.

1:34:29.498 --> 1:34:31.707
It's beginning to stink.

1:34:49.287 --> 1:34:51.958
Jimmy! O'Sullivan!

1:34:53.324 --> 1:34:56.897
O'-
Search every building.

1:35:13.575 --> 1:35:16.785
God compels our
fates to be intertwined.

1:35:16.820 --> 1:35:19.381
God does compel our fate.

1:35:19.416 --> 1:35:22.021
It was him who brought you here.

1:35:22.056 --> 1:35:23.825
- That's all we got?

1:35:25.961 --> 1:35:27.895
Okay.

1:35:30.031 --> 1:35:32.130
You any good with these?

1:35:32.165 --> 1:35:37.399
I've searched for a place
I can be at peace since the war.

1:35:38.435 --> 1:35:40.369
Since I was set free.

1:35:42.142 --> 1:35:44.538
I'm as good as I've
needed to be.

1:35:44.573 --> 1:35:46.474
And you?

1:35:47.851 --> 1:35:49.851
Better than I ought
to have been.

1:36:01.326 --> 1:36:05.394
It's just like shooting
a rabbit, right?

1:36:18.013 --> 1:36:19.507
Pick that up.

1:36:19.542 --> 1:36:22.147
You drop that,
pick it up.

1:36:22.182 --> 1:36:25.018
Load up! Load up!

1:37:01.056 --> 1:37:02.957
It looks like
they're going to war.

1:37:36.190 --> 1:37:37.618
Forgive me.

1:37:45.133 --> 1:37:46.528
Oh.

1:37:46.563 --> 1:37:48.134
I'm here from the prisoner.

1:37:48.169 --> 1:37:51.005
What makes you so sure
he's here?

1:37:52.635 --> 1:37:56.307
Be careful.
Do not lie to me.

1:37:56.342 --> 1:37:58.980
Ain't befitting a man of God.

1:38:00.115 --> 1:38:03.215
Ain't befitting
a man of law either.

1:38:03.250 --> 1:38:07.153
He's an innocent man.
His gun did not kill Dunnigan.

1:38:07.188 --> 1:38:11.091
You chase him down,
you're all murderers.

1:38:16.065 --> 1:38:17.295
Search the place.

1:38:17.330 --> 1:38:20.496
Oh, ho!
This is a house of God.

1:38:20.531 --> 1:38:22.333
You won't be bringing
you violence in here.

1:38:22.368 --> 1:38:25.435
Arrest him.

1:38:25.470 --> 1:38:27.536
O'Sullivan, take him to jail.

1:38:29.705 --> 1:38:31.947
All right.

1:38:33.181 --> 1:38:34.246
Hey, hey!

1:38:34.281 --> 1:38:36.083
Get him!

1:38:42.025 --> 1:38:43.717
-Go! Go!

1:39:06.445 --> 1:39:08.643
Let's go. Let's go, come on.

1:39:17.192 --> 1:39:20.226
Come with me. Hurry.

1:39:23.330 --> 1:39:25.033
You're safe here.

1:39:25.068 --> 1:39:27.068
Don't leave.

1:39:34.209 --> 1:39:35.406
Stop.

1:39:35.441 --> 1:39:36.770
- Hold your fire.

1:39:37.740 --> 1:39:39.707
No more killing.

1:39:46.683 --> 1:39:48.782
-Take cover!

1:39:48.817 --> 1:39:52.159
-Get him!
-Down there, come on!

1:40:26.525 --> 1:40:28.261
Let's go.

1:40:29.891 --> 1:40:31.495
Hey!

1:40:32.762 --> 1:40:34.333
Hey!

1:40:34.368 --> 1:40:36.071
Stop!

1:40:38.834 --> 1:40:40.570
He ain't guilty.

1:40:44.642 --> 1:40:46.114
Shit.

1:41:12.175 --> 1:41:14.373
-Jim!

1:41:21.745 --> 1:41:23.844
Preacher!

1:41:33.196 --> 1:41:34.525
Ah!

1:42:11.531 --> 1:42:13.498
The killer's getting away!

1:42:15.469 --> 1:42:17.634
Well, somebody do something!

1:42:19.737 --> 1:42:21.737
Put it down!

1:42:35.016 --> 1:42:36.719
Drop it.

1:43:16.024 --> 1:43:17.694
Hyah!

1:43:27.607 --> 1:43:29.772
Josephine, where are you going?

1:43:39.751 --> 1:43:43.522
-Shit!
-Stables, come on.

1:44:04.875 --> 1:44:06.677
Ah!

1:45:24.053 --> 1:45:25.855
Come on.

1:45:47.714 --> 1:45:50.715
I think I hit him.
I think I hit him.

1:45:51.817 --> 1:45:53.817
We can't outrun them.

1:45:53.852 --> 1:45:55.588
I know a place.

1:45:57.856 --> 1:45:59.592
Get him!

1:46:01.860 --> 1:46:03.024
Hyah!

1:46:16.479 --> 1:46:17.808
Wait up.

1:46:17.843 --> 1:46:19.513
Come on!

1:46:25.752 --> 1:46:27.422
We're close.

1:46:43.165 --> 1:46:44.868
Sit down.

1:46:44.903 --> 1:46:46.804
I have this.

1:46:54.176 --> 1:46:57.551
-They ain't here.
-They're here.

1:47:02.283 --> 1:47:06.692
If you're there, come out!
Before we shoot you out!

1:47:11.996 --> 1:47:13.897
Shit! Get down!

1:47:31.587 --> 1:47:34.786
No! Aah!

1:47:37.153 --> 1:47:38.724
Ah!

1:47:45.865 --> 1:47:47.260
They dead?

1:47:47.295 --> 1:47:50.197
I'm gonna put a bullet
in his head, make sure.

1:47:58.614 --> 1:48:02.110
- This is my last bullet.

1:48:29.975 --> 1:48:32.107
Ah!

1:48:34.078 --> 1:48:35.649
Stop!

1:48:40.117 --> 1:48:41.721
Stop!

1:48:43.087 --> 1:48:45.725
Ah! Dammit!

1:48:55.363 --> 1:48:57.330
Oh, God.

1:49:02.304 --> 1:49:03.974
-Ah!

1:49:53.729 --> 1:49:56.290
Mickey!

1:49:56.897 --> 1:49:59.029
-Mickey?
-Shh, shh, shh.

1:50:01.264 --> 1:50:03.165
Mickey, are you okay?

1:50:03.838 --> 1:50:06.003
I'll be better.

1:50:06.038 --> 1:50:08.203
Dear sweet Edgar.

1:50:39.874 --> 1:50:42.270
What happened?

1:50:42.305 --> 1:50:45.141
There's a fugitive.

1:50:45.176 --> 1:50:48.848
And he killed my husband,
and he's killed other people.

1:50:48.883 --> 1:50:50.476
Where is he now?

1:50:50.511 --> 1:50:52.445
He got away.

1:50:52.480 --> 1:50:54.986
Please, is there room for me?

1:50:55.021 --> 1:50:56.790
We've got plenty of room.

1:50:56.825 --> 1:51:00.123
These horses, they need water
if the danger's over.

1:51:00.158 --> 1:51:02.796
I'll take your bag.

1:51:08.199 --> 1:51:11.035
Thank you.

1:51:11.070 --> 1:51:13.037
Have it all to yourself.

1:51:26.954 --> 1:51:30.021
Sheriff's inside.
He's armed.

1:51:57.985 --> 1:52:01.987
Water, bandages quickly.

1:52:04.255 --> 1:52:05.991
Can you get a knife?

1:52:06.026 --> 1:52:07.927
-Ginny, get a knife.

1:52:07.962 --> 1:52:10.094
You got some water?

1:52:26.849 --> 1:52:29.850
Pa! Pa! He kill O'Sullivan,
he killed all those men.

1:52:29.885 --> 1:52:32.413
You got to do something, Pa.
Please. He tried.

1:52:32.448 --> 1:52:35.020
He's trying to pin it on me.

1:52:35.055 --> 1:52:37.220
Colt Navy.

1:52:40.896 --> 1:52:43.930
There's more than one
of those guns in this town.

1:52:43.965 --> 1:52:45.591
Why the hell is my son tied up?

1:52:45.626 --> 1:52:48.330
Come on, Sheriff,
you know the truth.

1:52:48.365 --> 1:52:50.464
- Come on, Pa

1:52:50.499 --> 1:52:52.235
Pa, he's in league
with that murderer.

1:52:52.270 --> 1:52:55.040
You got to believe me.
Okay?

1:52:55.075 --> 1:52:57.339
Come on, you can't --
You can't believe him.

1:53:04.315 --> 1:53:06.051
Did you do it, son?

1:53:07.120 --> 1:53:09.417
No.

1:53:09.452 --> 1:53:11.518
- Don't lie to me.

1:53:11.553 --> 1:53:14.488
Just tell me the truth.

1:53:15.359 --> 1:53:18.459
It -- it's done.

1:53:21.464 --> 1:53:23.299
Yes or no, Jimmy?

1:53:26.942 --> 1:53:29.173
Yes or no, God damn it!

1:53:38.184 --> 1:53:41.086
Dunnigan?

1:53:41.121 --> 1:53:42.450
You killed Dunnigan?

1:53:43.959 --> 1:53:45.893
And Violet?

1:53:50.295 --> 1:53:52.966
Isabel?

1:53:53.001 --> 1:53:55.034
Isabel?

1:53:55.663 --> 1:53:57.531
Isabel.

1:53:57.566 --> 1:53:59.500
Edgar seen him but wasn't sure.

1:53:59.535 --> 1:54:01.304
I know it was him.

1:54:01.339 --> 1:54:03.570
Why the hell didn't
you say something?

1:54:03.605 --> 1:54:06.980
Just like you said,
I'm lucky to have place here.

1:54:09.314 --> 1:54:12.150
The town called me,
god damn it, I answered.

1:54:15.254 --> 1:54:18.288
Where's Mrs. Dunnigan?

1:54:18.323 --> 1:54:19.520
I seen her out by the coach.

1:54:19.555 --> 1:54:22.028
Get her in here right now.

1:54:24.593 --> 1:54:25.999
- Mrs. Dunnigan!

1:54:26.034 --> 1:54:28.463
- Hey, have a seat.

1:54:28.498 --> 1:54:30.399
- Mrs. Dunnigan!

1:54:36.341 --> 1:54:38.176
Hey!

1:54:38.211 --> 1:54:40.442
Mrs. Dunnigan!

1:54:41.346 --> 1:54:43.511
Sheriff wants to see you.

1:54:55.558 --> 1:54:58.262
You fixin' on leaving so soon?

1:54:58.297 --> 1:55:00.297
Well, it's unsafe.

1:55:00.332 --> 1:55:03.168
And I was always planning
on taking that stage.

1:55:04.237 --> 1:55:06.138
Hm.

1:55:13.576 --> 1:55:15.279
Hi.

1:55:19.648 --> 1:55:22.088
Did you have a love affair
with my son?

1:55:22.123 --> 1:55:25.223
Me? Why would I do that?

1:55:30.791 --> 1:55:33.000
He gave it to me, and I...

1:55:33.035 --> 1:55:36.564
I didn't know what to do,
him being your son.

1:55:37.666 --> 1:55:39.072
Emma.

1:55:39.635 --> 1:55:42.504
And you were so kind.

1:55:42.539 --> 1:55:44.308
But I would return
your affections?

1:55:44.343 --> 1:55:47.542
I have a -- had a husband.

1:55:49.084 --> 1:55:51.381
You didn't love him.

1:55:51.416 --> 1:55:53.053
He got the wrong idea.

1:55:53.088 --> 1:55:54.582
I got the wrong idea?

1:55:57.191 --> 1:55:58.619
You kissed me.

1:55:58.654 --> 1:56:01.061
What I brought your husband
back, you kissed me.

1:56:01.096 --> 1:56:03.228
That's a lie, Jim.

1:56:03.263 --> 1:56:05.065
You told me that you loved me.

1:56:05.100 --> 1:56:07.628
You told me we were gonna
run away together.

1:56:07.663 --> 1:56:09.267
-You told me.
-Oh, Jim.

1:56:09.302 --> 1:56:13.436
We have to confess.
We have to just confess.

1:56:13.801 --> 1:56:16.109
You don't believe him, do you?

1:56:17.739 --> 1:56:19.475
Em.

1:56:22.282 --> 1:56:24.249
Oh. Hey.

1:56:24.284 --> 1:56:25.778
Let me go.

1:56:27.320 --> 1:56:29.551
You can keep the claim.

1:56:29.586 --> 1:56:32.059
Let me go, or I...

1:56:32.094 --> 1:56:34.061
I will kill him.

1:56:34.096 --> 1:56:36.723
-Put it down.
-I ain't gonna.

1:56:36.758 --> 1:56:38.758
I just want to get out of here.

1:56:38.793 --> 1:56:41.662
I just want to get out
of this place.

1:56:41.697 --> 1:56:43.136
-Ah!

1:56:43.171 --> 1:56:44.434
Dad!

1:56:44.469 --> 1:56:46.370
-Ah!

1:56:46.405 --> 1:56:48.174
Hey!

1:56:48.209 --> 1:56:50.440
Oh, no!

1:57:54.242 --> 1:57:56.275
I always thought I was
going to be somebody.

1:57:56.310 --> 1:57:58.277
Shh.

1:58:00.413 --> 1:58:03.513
You never did.

1:58:03.548 --> 1:58:05.713
You were right.

1:58:21.533 --> 1:58:23.335
Shh.

1:58:26.571 --> 1:58:28.868
I'm sorry.

1:58:28.903 --> 1:58:30.738
-Shh.
-I'm sorry.

1:58:30.773 --> 1:58:33.246
Shh.

1:59:14.454 --> 1:59:16.355
I think this is yours.

1:59:20.724 --> 1:59:22.460
Thank you.

1:59:29.271 --> 1:59:30.600
Hm.

1:59:31.702 --> 1:59:35.704
Well, bury our friends,

1:59:35.739 --> 1:59:38.839
pray for their souls.

1:59:38.874 --> 1:59:40.709
All of them.

1:59:44.044 --> 1:59:47.782
And we're going
to rebuild this town.

1:59:47.817 --> 1:59:49.883
Make it better than it was.

1:59:54.362 --> 1:59:55.625
And perhaps there
will be a time

1:59:55.660 --> 1:59:57.891
we no longer need to fight.

2:00:00.632 --> 2:00:02.335
Perhaps.
