WEBVTT

00:00.953 --> 00:02.772
Previously on "The Path"...

00:02.773 --> 00:05.772
I don't even know what's
real anymore, and what is...

00:05.773 --> 00:08.362
We'll just figure it out,
because you're real to me.

00:08.363 --> 00:11.562
You know, if there's anything I can do

00:11.563 --> 00:13.732
to help...

00:13.733 --> 00:16.582
- Cal came and got me.
- You're here.

00:16.583 --> 00:19.552
He said this is where I'm supposed to be.

00:19.553 --> 00:20.622
They are trying to kill me,

00:20.623 --> 00:21.722
and they will kill you.

00:23.573 --> 00:25.552
Come on, Alison. Come back with me.

00:26.633 --> 00:28.692
Go!

00:28.693 --> 00:31.522
- I want you to take the walk.
- Steve's walk?

00:31.523 --> 00:33.742
If you don't do the walk, I
will tell Sarah everything.

00:33.743 --> 00:35.682
I'll tell her you don't believe.

00:35.683 --> 00:39.572
When did you know about...
you always hear the elders

00:39.573 --> 00:41.722
talking about the moment
when they felt it, The Light.

00:41.723 --> 00:45.582
Closest thing to it, when I met your mom.

00:45.583 --> 00:47.652
- Stop.
- You know, she can just...

00:47.653 --> 00:49.572
What's going on?

00:49.573 --> 00:51.622
- Lift all my doubts.
- And he's lying to you.

01:42.583 --> 01:45.592
We can never allow fear

01:45.593 --> 01:50.612
to limit the work of our spirits.

01:50.613 --> 01:54.742
Your words...

01:56.613 --> 01:59.712
And you said to me often
when I was growing up...

01:59.713 --> 02:04.562
you said it again the day
of your... your diagnosis.

02:05.693 --> 02:08.592
"Don't let The Movement die.

02:08.592 --> 02:13.522
You're the only one I can
trust to keep it alive."

02:13.523 --> 02:15.752
I've tried to fulfill

02:15.753 --> 02:20.532
your wishes.

02:20.533 --> 02:21.622
I'm trying to be your son.

02:26.563 --> 02:29.652
I wrote the rungs.

02:29.653 --> 02:32.752
I tried to channel you.

02:32.753 --> 02:36.642
But if... if you're unhappy with me,

02:36.643 --> 02:38.722
please tell me, 'cause

02:38.723 --> 02:42.522
there won't be another chance.

02:43.573 --> 02:45.662
I'm sorry for everything...

02:47.563 --> 02:49.742
I have done

02:49.743 --> 02:52.522
that is wrong

02:52.523 --> 02:55.692
and everything wrong...

02:57.623 --> 03:01.552
I do next.

03:03.603 --> 03:06.583
But you weren't supposed to die.

03:33.563 --> 03:34.682
I don't know what you're thinking,

03:34.683 --> 03:36.622
but we're not having an affair.

03:36.623 --> 03:38.682
Why did he call you 22 times
in the last three months?

03:38.683 --> 03:41.543
It's not my place to say.

03:45.563 --> 03:49.632
Your husband left a journal.

03:49.633 --> 03:52.552
- What?
- I took his file,

03:52.553 --> 03:55.572
and the journal was in it.

03:55.573 --> 03:58.542
Where is it?

03:58.543 --> 04:01.592
They found it in the room
that he was staying at in Peru.

04:01.593 --> 04:04.582
Why wasn't it given to the police?

04:04.583 --> 04:09.702
I think you'll understand when you read it.

04:16.743 --> 04:22.522
Your husband was having doubts.

04:22.523 --> 04:25.642
Doubts?

04:25.643 --> 04:28.752
About the Movement.

04:28.753 --> 04:32.592
He realized it was bullshit
and didn't know what to do.

04:37.663 --> 04:40.572
At least he's alive,

04:40.573 --> 04:42.542
and he loves you,

04:42.543 --> 04:44.562
enough to walk that fucking walk,

04:44.563 --> 04:47.732
enough to drink the fucking juice.

04:47.733 --> 04:49.672
So what?

04:49.673 --> 04:53.702
He doesn't believe there's
a ladder in the sky.

04:53.703 --> 04:56.752
Get over yourself.

05:17.613 --> 05:19.612
What's Mom gonna make for dinner?

05:19.613 --> 05:21.522
I hope it's veggie chili.

05:21.523 --> 05:23.722
Oh, and with cornbread?

05:23.723 --> 05:25.692
Oh. Oh, my God.

05:25.693 --> 05:27.692
- With butter?
- Yes.

05:27.693 --> 05:31.533
I am going to eat a stick of butter.

05:36.733 --> 05:38.602
Look.

05:45.583 --> 05:46.682
Wow.

05:50.573 --> 05:52.712
Hey.

05:52.713 --> 05:56.632
It's gonna be okay.

05:56.633 --> 06:01.582
What if she kicks me out?

06:01.583 --> 06:04.742
I will not let that happen.

06:04.743 --> 06:06.582
All right?

06:10.583 --> 06:12.582
Come on.

06:16.713 --> 06:18.602
Ah.

06:18.603 --> 06:21.562
If she ends up not making veggie chili,

06:21.563 --> 06:22.672
can you make veggie chili?

06:29.593 --> 06:31.592
What's going on?

06:38.613 --> 06:42.692
I need your help.

06:42.693 --> 06:44.742
I started taking this when you were gone.

06:44.743 --> 06:46.752
Luckily it hasn't been very long,

06:46.753 --> 06:48.612
so withdrawal should
only take a couple of days

06:48.613 --> 06:50.522
and I've gotten off worse stuff.

06:50.523 --> 06:51.672
- Where did you get this?
- I can't tell you.

06:51.673 --> 06:56.542
- Mary.
- Are you gonna help me or not?

06:56.543 --> 06:57.722
Let's just go to the nurse.
We'll do this the right way.

06:57.723 --> 06:59.582
It has to be this way.

07:19.583 --> 07:21.642
- Hey, they're back.
- I see them.

07:40.543 --> 07:42.752
- Hey.
- Check it out, Hawk, man.

07:42.753 --> 07:44.532
What's up?

07:44.533 --> 07:47.592
Tell us everything.

07:49.603 --> 07:50.722
Look at this guy, with a beard.

07:51.723 --> 07:53.612
I do not have a beard.

07:53.613 --> 07:55.532
Oh, I see it. It's right there.

07:55.533 --> 07:57.532
Oh, Grandpa is gonna kick himself.

07:57.533 --> 07:58.682
He's doing outreach in Vermont.

07:58.683 --> 08:00.642
Good to see you, my friend.

08:02.653 --> 08:04.712
I don't have a beard.

08:17.623 --> 08:18.702
Mm.

08:18.703 --> 08:20.752
I know about Alison.

08:53.673 --> 08:55.672
So how did you find out?

09:00.753 --> 09:03.572
I found your phone.

09:09.693 --> 09:12.582
Then you spoke with Alison?

09:19.653 --> 09:21.682
So what happens now?

09:21.683 --> 09:25.712
Now?

09:25.713 --> 09:29.542
I don't know, Eddie.

09:29.543 --> 09:32.612
I mean, now that you've
been lying to me for months,

09:32.613 --> 09:34.732
now that I called Miranda
Frank a fucking whore,

09:34.733 --> 09:37.592
now that I thought that I was
going crazy because I knew...

09:37.593 --> 09:39.752
because I knew

09:39.753 --> 09:43.732
something was wrong.

09:43.733 --> 09:45.522
But I trusted you.

09:45.523 --> 09:47.642
I know.

09:47.643 --> 09:48.712
Look, I know.

09:48.713 --> 09:53.642
I just...

09:53.643 --> 09:54.732
I didn't know what to do.

09:54.733 --> 09:57.562
How about tell me the fucking truth?

09:57.563 --> 10:01.702
Yeah, but then you would put
me in a cell to be reprogrammed.

10:01.703 --> 10:02.712
Maybe that would have helped.

10:02.713 --> 10:05.712
No, it wouldn't have.

10:05.713 --> 10:08.602
Well, things are pretty fucked up now.

10:08.603 --> 10:13.522
Yeah, maybe, but at least you're here

10:13.523 --> 10:14.712
talking to me,

10:14.713 --> 10:16.592
your husband,

10:16.593 --> 10:18.532
and not some pod person.

10:18.533 --> 10:21.642
Oh, I'm a pod person? Is
that what you're saying?

10:21.643 --> 10:23.632
No, I'm not saying that.
I'm saying I would have been

10:23.633 --> 10:26.642
if you sent me in a room to be brainwashed.

10:26.643 --> 10:29.662
What are you talking about?

10:29.663 --> 10:31.542
Don't touch me.

10:31.543 --> 10:32.672
I don't even know who you are.

10:32.673 --> 10:37.602
Hey. Hey. I am the same person.

10:37.603 --> 10:38.752
Okay? I love you.

10:38.753 --> 10:40.632
I love our family.

10:40.633 --> 10:43.612
I believe in the work that we do.

10:43.613 --> 10:44.712
Okay?

10:44.713 --> 10:49.602
But the rest is just fucking fairy tales.

10:49.603 --> 10:52.692
You're talking about everything...

10:52.693 --> 10:55.652
everything in my soul.

10:55.653 --> 10:58.712
Oh, Jesus, Sarah.

10:58.713 --> 11:00.602
Who gives a shit?

11:00.603 --> 11:02.612
I mean, how many people
eat a fucking cracker

11:02.613 --> 11:05.632
and really believe that
it's the body of Christ?

11:05.633 --> 11:07.672
I don't give a shit what other people do.

11:07.673 --> 11:13.602
I am not other people, and
we are not other people.

11:13.603 --> 11:15.592
All right.

11:15.593 --> 11:18.532
I realized on the walk

11:18.533 --> 11:21.702
we are what matters.

11:21.703 --> 11:25.592
We're all that matters.

11:25.593 --> 11:28.612
We're a part of something that matters,

11:28.613 --> 11:32.742
and we matter because we are a part of it.

11:32.743 --> 11:37.642
You don't actually believe that.

11:37.643 --> 11:39.752
You don't know me.

11:52.643 --> 11:57.592
I am very sorry about
my outburst last week.

11:57.593 --> 11:59.622
I'm gonna be completely calm

11:59.623 --> 12:01.672
and ask you, please,

12:01.673 --> 12:03.572
don't take me off this case.

12:03.573 --> 12:04.672
It has nothing to do with me.

12:04.673 --> 12:05.742
I can't make that call and you know it.

12:05.743 --> 12:06.752
You and I both know that the IRS

12:06.753 --> 12:09.652
is gonna sit on this for years.

12:09.653 --> 12:11.662
These people killed a doctor.

12:11.663 --> 12:14.562
- It was a suicide.
- I don't think so.

12:14.563 --> 12:16.732
They take innocent people...

12:16.733 --> 12:19.572
broken people... they lure them in

12:19.573 --> 12:21.582
and they don't let them leave.

12:24.743 --> 12:28.562
When's your daughter's surgery?

12:28.563 --> 12:29.722
It's, uh, next week.

12:29.723 --> 12:31.712
Take a couple of weeks off.

12:31.713 --> 12:35.742
Spend time with your family.

12:37.733 --> 12:40.612
You know what? This movement
is gonna get more powerful.

12:40.613 --> 12:42.702
They have a new leader,
and he's very charismatic,

12:42.703 --> 12:44.632
very ambitious.

12:44.633 --> 12:48.552
You let this sit for
months... Rindge, Hondurans...

12:48.553 --> 12:51.532
that'll be small potatoes.

12:51.533 --> 12:55.612
The other choice is you're suspended.

12:55.613 --> 12:58.573
I'll see you in two weeks, Abe.

13:04.543 --> 13:05.722
Hey.

13:13.623 --> 13:16.752
You wanted to see me?

13:16.753 --> 13:20.662
Uh, yeah.

13:20.663 --> 13:22.562
First I want to apologize.

13:22.563 --> 13:26.612
For letting me believe my
husband fucked Miranda Frank?

13:26.613 --> 13:27.712
Yes.

13:27.713 --> 13:29.622
Why didn't you tell me what you knew?

13:31.583 --> 13:35.542
- I don't know exactly...
- I do.

13:35.543 --> 13:37.542
Made you feel powerful knowing everything

13:37.543 --> 13:38.722
while I walked around
like a deer in headlights.

13:38.723 --> 13:41.612
No. No, that's not true, Sarah.

13:41.613 --> 13:45.622
I-I didn't know everything
at first, and I was torn.

13:45.623 --> 13:46.732
You know, I wanted to wait until I did,

13:46.733 --> 13:50.523
and it killed me not to tell you.

13:53.523 --> 13:55.683
You know I... Is there something else?

13:59.703 --> 14:01.702
Yeah.

14:01.703 --> 14:04.582
Steve finished the rungs.

14:09.633 --> 14:13.592
- That means...
- That means he's leaving us.

14:13.593 --> 14:15.522
- When?
- Soon.

14:18.623 --> 14:20.672
Well, is he gonna come here?
Is he gonna say good-bye?

14:23.703 --> 14:26.592
I don't know. I...

14:37.633 --> 14:39.552
I'm gonna tell everyone Steve's plan

14:39.553 --> 14:41.642
at Friday's meeting of the Upper Rungs.

14:48.563 --> 14:50.592
Uh, there's something else.

14:50.593 --> 14:53.692
Um... he wants you to help

14:53.693 --> 14:57.552
shape the next phase
of The Movement with me.

14:57.553 --> 15:00.622
He wants us to be Guardians of The Light...

15:00.623 --> 15:02.653
together.

15:44.643 --> 15:46.612
I missed you.

15:46.613 --> 15:49.692
I missed you too.

15:49.693 --> 15:52.642
Let's go somewhere.

15:52.643 --> 15:54.642
Okay.

16:10.673 --> 16:12.612
What's wrong?

16:12.613 --> 16:15.712
Nothing.

16:15.713 --> 16:18.693
Tell me.

16:20.693 --> 16:23.612
Um...

16:23.613 --> 16:27.672
We're living in my mom's car.

16:27.673 --> 16:29.732
I mean, Zak isn't... he's
staying at a friend's house...

16:29.733 --> 16:33.523
but me and my mom...

16:35.733 --> 16:38.752
I can help. I can...

16:38.753 --> 16:41.602
How?

16:41.603 --> 16:43.632
I can drop out of school, get a job.

16:43.633 --> 16:45.632
- I mean, I can always go back.
- That's crazy.

16:45.633 --> 16:48.552
You can't do that for me.

16:48.553 --> 16:49.582
I mean, what about your parents?

16:49.583 --> 16:51.672
I'm leaving The Movement.

16:51.673 --> 16:55.523
I decided while I was on the walk.

16:58.573 --> 17:00.542
No, this is your entire life.

17:00.543 --> 17:03.652
Not anymore.

17:03.653 --> 17:04.742
You're my life now.

17:13.653 --> 17:16.551
I want to give a warm
welcome back to Eddie Lane,

17:16.553 --> 17:18.712
who completed the walk
yesterday after ten days

17:18.713 --> 17:20.531
on the road.

17:30.683 --> 17:33.742
Um...

17:33.743 --> 17:35.662
You know, um,

17:35.663 --> 17:38.522
the first thing I found on the walk

17:38.523 --> 17:40.642
is that you do not do the walk

17:40.643 --> 17:42.542
in the middle of winter.

17:43.703 --> 17:47.622
Um...

17:47.623 --> 17:48.742
You know, everyone says

17:48.743 --> 17:52.572
that they have these
big moments on the walk.

17:52.573 --> 17:55.632
They, uh, they see truth.

17:55.633 --> 17:58.532
Um...

17:58.533 --> 17:59.752
Truth is, um,

17:59.753 --> 18:01.652
I didn't.

18:01.653 --> 18:04.612
You know, I saw a lot
of... a lot of highway,

18:04.613 --> 18:05.732
broken bottles,

18:05.733 --> 18:08.562
broken people, um,

18:08.563 --> 18:10.702
kind people,

18:10.703 --> 18:12.572
fast food wrappers,

18:12.573 --> 18:16.742
and, uh, and road kill.

18:16.743 --> 18:21.682
You know, the whole time, I was thinking,

18:21.683 --> 18:26.532
"How fast can I get home?"

18:26.533 --> 18:30.673
So I guess that's what I... I found.

18:32.583 --> 18:36.522
No matter where I am, I just want to be...

18:36.523 --> 18:37.722
just want to be home

18:37.723 --> 18:41.722
with my... my wife

18:41.723 --> 18:45.522
and my kids.

18:45.523 --> 18:46.753
They are my Truth.

18:48.583 --> 18:50.683
Um...

18:51.753 --> 18:53.752
That's all I got.

18:53.753 --> 18:56.542
Thanks.

19:46.543 --> 19:49.562
Hey.

19:49.563 --> 19:51.572
Oh, shit. I'm sorry.

19:51.573 --> 19:52.712
Here.

19:55.713 --> 20:00.552
- Ow, shit!
- Hey, hey.

20:00.553 --> 20:02.662
- I'm sorry.
- Just...

20:02.663 --> 20:05.572
Come here.

20:05.573 --> 20:07.582
Let me see it.

20:07.583 --> 20:09.632
It's fine.

20:11.733 --> 20:14.712
Come here.

21:46.703 --> 21:49.602
You okay?

21:49.603 --> 21:52.693
It's hard to eat. Stomach's not so great.

21:59.593 --> 22:00.682
What is up with her?

22:00.683 --> 22:02.592
You know what? I'm gonna say something.

22:02.593 --> 22:04.582
Please don't.

22:04.583 --> 22:05.682
Hey, what's your problem?

22:05.683 --> 22:07.692
Why don't you ask your girlfriend?

22:07.693 --> 22:09.612
It's nothing. Please, forget it.

22:09.613 --> 22:11.532
No, look, I'm tired of
all these dirty looks.

22:11.533 --> 22:13.642
- What did she ever do to you?
- Why don't you ask her?

22:13.643 --> 22:16.562
- What is she talking about?
- Nothing. I didn't do anything.

22:16.563 --> 22:18.632
Just forget it. Come on.

22:18.633 --> 22:20.532
She fucked me.

22:20.533 --> 22:21.592
That's what she did.

22:21.593 --> 22:22.672
- What?
- Sean, please...

22:22.673 --> 22:26.752
Is she using you for drugs too?

22:26.753 --> 22:29.562
- Is that true?
- That's all she wants,

22:29.563 --> 22:31.602
and we're the idiots who
think we're saving her.

22:31.603 --> 22:34.572
She's a junkie and a liar, and...

22:35.583 --> 22:36.672
Hey, no, Mary! No, Mary!

22:36.673 --> 22:39.582
Hey. Hey. What is going on here?

22:39.583 --> 22:41.582
That is not cool.

22:41.583 --> 22:43.582
No way.

22:54.633 --> 22:55.632
My man.

22:59.703 --> 23:01.562
Yeah?

23:01.563 --> 23:03.662
Hey, Sam, it's, uh, Eddie Lane.

23:03.663 --> 23:05.702
Yeah, what?

23:05.703 --> 23:07.742
Um...

23:07.743 --> 23:09.662
hey, I noticed that you haven't been

23:09.663 --> 23:11.662
to gathering in the past few weeks

23:11.663 --> 23:13.632
and I just wanted to check in,

23:13.633 --> 23:16.732
see if everything was okay.

23:16.733 --> 23:20.652
No. Everything's not okay.

23:20.653 --> 23:23.672
What's going on?

23:23.673 --> 23:26.532
You know, well,

23:26.533 --> 23:28.622
my daughter's about to
check into St. Michael's

23:28.623 --> 23:30.562
and get her chest cut open.

23:30.563 --> 23:31.732
That's one thing,

23:31.733 --> 23:34.682
and I might have lost my job.

23:34.683 --> 23:39.622
Oh. Um, I am so sorry, Sam.

23:39.623 --> 23:42.612
Yeah, I bet you are.

23:42.613 --> 23:44.642
And I'm the perfect
recruit right now, right?

23:44.643 --> 23:46.552
On my last leg?

23:46.553 --> 23:47.682
That's how you guys like 'em.

23:47.683 --> 23:51.522
You know, we... we really
do help a lot of people.

23:51.523 --> 23:54.632
Man, you know why I didn't go to gathering?

23:54.633 --> 23:56.752
Because it's bullshit.

23:56.753 --> 24:00.622
You people are bullshit.

24:00.623 --> 24:04.522
Your Light is not going
to help my kid get better,

24:04.523 --> 24:07.682
so please just stop
fucking calling me, okay?

24:07.683 --> 24:09.562
Okay.

24:12.603 --> 24:14.582
- Okay?
- Yeah. Okay.

24:14.583 --> 24:16.612
I, uh, I won't call you again.

24:16.613 --> 24:18.562
But listen,

24:18.563 --> 24:22.692
I truly believe that your
kid is going to be fine,

24:22.693 --> 24:24.662
but you need to believe that too,

24:24.663 --> 24:25.712
all right?

24:25.713 --> 24:28.562
Forget The Light.

24:28.563 --> 24:30.662
Okay? Fuck The Light.

24:30.663 --> 24:34.623
Just do not give up on your kid, all right?

24:35.713 --> 24:39.692
Sam.

24:52.663 --> 24:54.632
So you, uh...

24:54.633 --> 24:57.613
I was lonely.

24:59.613 --> 25:01.572
I really liked her,

25:01.573 --> 25:04.522
and I thought she really liked me.

25:04.523 --> 25:06.562
I'm sure.

25:06.563 --> 25:08.602
Steve understood the challenges

25:08.603 --> 25:10.542
of bringing together a community of people

25:10.543 --> 25:13.523
with deep wounds.

25:14.713 --> 25:18.522
That's why we have to forgive.

25:18.523 --> 25:21.572
That's the only way to heal.

25:21.573 --> 25:22.722
Why don't you take a week in rehab, Betsy?

25:22.723 --> 25:25.713
It'll do you good. I'll talk to Richard.

25:38.683 --> 25:42.712
I know how hard this must be for you.

25:42.713 --> 25:47.552
I know you came to us full of heartbreak.

25:47.553 --> 25:49.722
But perhaps

25:49.723 --> 25:54.562
this is what The Light is giving in return.

25:54.563 --> 25:58.522
Steve believes that committing

25:58.523 --> 26:00.562
to another human being's wounds,

26:00.563 --> 26:01.652
past, present, and future,

26:01.653 --> 26:03.552
is a great challenge

26:03.553 --> 26:06.612
but also the most rewarding experience

26:06.613 --> 26:10.522
one can have in this life.

26:10.523 --> 26:12.592
That's why marriage

26:12.593 --> 26:16.543
is a cornerstone of The Movement.

26:26.693 --> 26:29.662
If you forgive me, I want that...

26:29.663 --> 26:31.652
that challenge.

26:31.653 --> 26:35.642
With you.

26:35.643 --> 26:38.532
I kept thinking when I was walking,

26:38.533 --> 26:39.732
we know nothing.

26:39.733 --> 26:41.612
Nothing of suffering.

26:41.613 --> 26:43.632
You know, we may walk 250 miles

26:43.633 --> 26:44.662
with no money

26:44.663 --> 26:46.742
and, yeah, our feet hurt

26:46.743 --> 26:48.692
and we see poverty and pain,

26:48.693 --> 26:50.642
but nothing compared to how

26:50.643 --> 26:53.682
people in other countries live.

26:53.683 --> 26:55.572
We're in our own backyard.

26:55.573 --> 26:57.752
I mean, for us, it'll end.

26:57.753 --> 27:02.533
We will finish the walk and
end up in our comfy beds.

27:08.573 --> 27:10.532
What about you, Hawk?

27:10.533 --> 27:11.732
Um...

27:11.733 --> 27:15.652
I-I don't know.

27:15.653 --> 27:19.732
You don't know?

27:19.733 --> 27:21.722
What did you miss?

27:21.723 --> 27:24.632
Probably my comfy bed.

27:24.633 --> 27:27.702
Uncle Cal kept it warm for you.

27:27.703 --> 27:29.682
What?

27:29.683 --> 27:31.752
He was sick... body sick,

27:31.753 --> 27:34.752
so he slept in Hawk's bed.

27:34.753 --> 27:37.542
- Really?
- Yes.

27:37.543 --> 27:39.592
- What was he sick with?
- Uh, guys...

27:39.593 --> 27:40.652
And he's not your uncle.

27:40.653 --> 27:41.722
Eddie.

27:41.723 --> 27:44.582
I just want to make that clear.

27:44.583 --> 27:46.542
He is not your family.

27:46.543 --> 27:47.582
This is your family.

27:47.583 --> 27:49.572
- Stop it.
- I'm leaving.

27:59.613 --> 28:01.522
While I was on the walk,

28:01.523 --> 28:02.712
I decided,

28:02.713 --> 28:07.632
and I gave this a lot of thought,

28:07.633 --> 28:09.712
and I'm not gonna take my vows when I'm 16.

28:09.713 --> 28:12.622
I'm gonna stay in high school.

28:27.573 --> 28:29.562
Well, then you won't talk to me

28:29.563 --> 28:31.742
or your sister or anyone
in your family again.

28:31.743 --> 28:35.562
- Mom.
- Sarah.

28:35.563 --> 28:36.642
But Dad said I could.

28:36.643 --> 28:39.532
He said it would be okay.

28:39.533 --> 28:40.722
Well, Dad lied.

28:46.583 --> 28:48.632
Eat.

28:48.633 --> 28:50.563
There are people suffering tonight.

30:32.693 --> 30:34.742
What are you doing?

30:34.743 --> 30:39.602
I'm leaving.

30:39.603 --> 30:40.652
Where are you gonna sleep?

30:40.653 --> 30:41.672
I was just homeless.

30:41.673 --> 30:43.612
I can keep doing it.

30:43.613 --> 30:45.742
You are not gonna be homeless.

30:45.743 --> 30:50.612
- Let him go.
- What?

30:50.613 --> 30:52.682
- Let him go.
- Sarah.

30:57.603 --> 30:59.712
Hawk.

30:59.713 --> 31:02.682
Hawk!

31:04.613 --> 31:05.652
This is crazy.

31:05.653 --> 31:07.582
He's a
15-year-old kid.

31:07.583 --> 31:08.702
Where is Hawk going?

31:08.703 --> 31:10.562
He's fine, honey, I promise you.

31:10.563 --> 31:11.662
Sarah.

31:11.663 --> 31:13.542
You were supposed to talk sense into him.

31:13.543 --> 31:15.672
Why do you think I let him go on the walk?

31:15.673 --> 31:17.672
But you couldn't do that, could you?

31:17.673 --> 31:19.562
'Cause you were too busy
deciding whether or not

31:19.563 --> 31:22.752
you wanted to stay yourself.

31:22.753 --> 31:25.642
Come on, honey, I don't want to be late.

31:59.563 --> 32:03.602
So, that is what is going on.

32:03.603 --> 32:06.742
Oh.

32:06.743 --> 32:08.732
Sarah didn't tell you any of this?

32:14.543 --> 32:16.612
What do you want, Eddie?

32:16.613 --> 32:19.542
Look, I just... I want...

32:19.543 --> 32:20.752
I want some help.

32:20.753 --> 32:24.742
Okay, I need you to
talk some sense into her.

32:24.743 --> 32:26.682
Oh.

32:26.683 --> 32:28.722
I mean, you lost a kid.
You know what this is like.

32:28.723 --> 32:29.722
You need to get into a program.

32:29.723 --> 32:31.652
I can take you there right now.

32:31.653 --> 32:32.752
Gaby, call Richard. Tell
him I'll bring Eddie in.

32:32.753 --> 32:35.712
No, hey, hey. I'm not doing a program.

32:35.713 --> 32:37.532
Program won't work for him.

32:37.533 --> 32:40.572
- It has to.
- He's gone.

32:40.573 --> 32:42.612
I am not gone. I'm right here.

32:42.613 --> 32:44.562
We have to try.
He's our son-in-law.

32:44.563 --> 32:48.712
Not anymore.

32:48.713 --> 32:51.652
There's got to be some
fucking room for doubt.

32:54.643 --> 32:57.642
That's what's caused the
world to be in such shit shape.

33:01.733 --> 33:03.622
You'll lose everyone.

33:03.623 --> 33:05.662
People who lack conviction.

33:05.663 --> 33:07.652
Cowards.

34:32.603 --> 34:34.712
- Can I take your coat for you?
- Thank you.

34:40.672 --> 34:43.752
Can I get you a drink?

34:43.753 --> 34:46.612
Amelia. Gibson.

34:46.612 --> 34:49.532
- Cal Roberts.
- Well?

34:50.703 --> 34:53.641
I-I don't drink.

34:53.643 --> 34:56.581
What do you do, Cal Roberts?

34:56.583 --> 34:58.712
Cal. I'm glad you called.

34:58.713 --> 35:01.642
John. Um...

35:01.643 --> 35:04.622
Uh...

35:04.623 --> 35:07.522
Good to meet you, Amelia. Next time.

35:24.703 --> 35:26.662
I love this place.

35:30.643 --> 35:34.572
So, I called you a dozen times.

35:34.573 --> 35:35.702
What made you finally decide

35:35.703 --> 35:38.722
to forgive me for having
the shit beat out of you?

35:38.723 --> 35:42.582
Um, how's Freddie?

35:42.583 --> 35:43.732
Totally new kid.

35:43.733 --> 35:45.722
Back in school.

35:45.723 --> 35:49.632
Art school, but you can't have everything.

35:49.633 --> 35:51.752
Want a drink?

35:51.753 --> 35:53.642
No, just water.

35:58.543 --> 36:01.532
John, I'd like you to
help me with something.

36:01.533 --> 36:02.642
I see.

36:02.643 --> 36:04.532
The answer to my question.

36:04.533 --> 36:05.672
You're forgiving because you found a way

36:05.673 --> 36:09.642
for me to make it up to you.

36:09.643 --> 36:12.622
That's right.

36:12.623 --> 36:16.612
I want to do for hundreds of people... no,

36:16.613 --> 36:19.692
thousands of people
what we did for your son.

36:19.693 --> 36:21.562
We've got the manpower, we've got dozens

36:21.563 --> 36:22.672
of young people that want to get out there,

36:22.673 --> 36:25.632
get on the ground, make a difference.

36:25.633 --> 36:27.542
- How much you looking for?
- No,

36:27.543 --> 36:28.732
I'm not here to ask for
money. I've got money.

36:28.733 --> 36:31.612
I've got money pouring in.

36:31.613 --> 36:35.622
People believe in us,
they want to contribute,

36:35.623 --> 36:38.692
but we're still in the Dark Ages.

36:38.693 --> 36:41.572
We might as well have our
money under a mattress.

36:41.573 --> 36:42.672
We need stability.

36:42.673 --> 36:47.542
You want me to handle your investments.

36:47.543 --> 36:49.642
I want expansion.

36:49.643 --> 36:53.662
I want real estate, and all over the world,

36:53.663 --> 36:57.612
and offshore accounts, tax shelters.

36:57.613 --> 37:00.592
I see. We can set up a meeting,

37:00.593 --> 37:02.642
talk with some of your
higher-ranking members.

37:02.643 --> 37:06.572
Well, I don't see why we
need to involve anyone else.

37:06.573 --> 37:08.552
Our leadership structure is evolving.

37:08.553 --> 37:10.622
I'll be taking the more active role.

37:10.623 --> 37:12.632
All right.

37:12.633 --> 37:14.632
Let's see what we're looking at here.

37:26.713 --> 37:28.702
Silas, it's Sarah.

37:28.703 --> 37:31.652
Are you there?

37:31.653 --> 37:34.662
I've been calling you for days.

37:34.663 --> 37:38.752
I imagine you're on one of your journeys.

37:38.753 --> 37:41.622
I hope you come back soon. I...

37:48.623 --> 37:52.522
I need your counsel.

38:08.623 --> 38:10.562
Sarah.

38:10.563 --> 38:11.742
What are you doing out here? It's freezing.

38:11.743 --> 38:15.692
Come on.

38:30.683 --> 38:31.682
Why are you wearing a tie?

38:39.703 --> 38:42.662
Oh, no, no, no.

39:16.583 --> 39:18.562
Shh.

39:37.663 --> 39:42.572
Hawk.

39:42.573 --> 39:45.572
He's leaving us.

39:48.573 --> 39:50.612
That's unacceptable.

39:53.553 --> 39:54.722
Help me.

39:54.723 --> 39:57.702
Help me.

39:57.703 --> 39:59.672
Please, help me.

40:40.563 --> 40:42.572
Hey, Ashley.

40:42.573 --> 40:44.592
I'm a friend of Hawk's family.

40:44.593 --> 40:46.662
Yeah, I remember you from, like, the church

40:46.663 --> 40:47.722
or whatever you call it.

40:47.723 --> 40:51.552
Can I talk to you about something?

40:51.553 --> 40:52.672
Uh, yeah, I guess.

40:52.673 --> 40:53.722
Well, actually, there's something

40:53.723 --> 40:55.672
I'd like to show you,

40:55.673 --> 40:59.702
and then I'll drop you wherever
you want to go afterwards.

40:59.703 --> 41:02.583
Come on.

41:18.683 --> 41:22.533
What are we doing here?

41:25.683 --> 41:27.522
I left the heat on.

41:27.523 --> 41:29.682
Warm it up for you.

41:29.683 --> 41:32.552
Whose house is this?

41:32.553 --> 41:33.552
Yours.

41:33.553 --> 41:34.722
It belongs to a member.

41:34.723 --> 41:36.732
They're working in San
Diego for the next 18 months,

41:36.733 --> 41:38.712
so it's empty.

41:38.713 --> 41:42.632
Your mother won't know it's ours.

41:42.633 --> 41:44.722
I could see you at that desk,

41:44.723 --> 41:47.612
studying, college applications.

41:47.613 --> 41:48.642
Where do you want to go?

41:48.643 --> 41:49.752
Uh, NYU.

41:49.753 --> 41:51.552
Oh, yeah, I'll bet you'll get in.

41:51.553 --> 41:52.602
Scholarship.

41:54.553 --> 41:56.732
You just need a room of your own, right?

41:56.733 --> 42:00.692
Everyone does.

42:00.693 --> 42:02.522
Why are you doing this?

42:02.523 --> 42:06.622
Um, I need to ask you a favor.

42:06.623 --> 42:08.632
I need you ask you to
really put some thought

42:08.633 --> 42:11.602
into what's going on with you and Hawk.

42:11.603 --> 42:12.602
I knew it.

42:12.603 --> 42:15.552
Because he... he loves you,

42:15.553 --> 42:18.672
enough to give up everything.

42:18.673 --> 42:19.752
He wants to leave.

42:19.753 --> 42:22.682
Because he met you.

42:22.683 --> 42:24.682
Come on.

42:29.693 --> 42:33.602
That's why I really... I
really want you to understand

42:33.603 --> 42:35.712
what leaving will mean for him.

42:35.713 --> 42:39.752
Hawk... he grew up a Meyerist,

42:39.753 --> 42:43.602
and if he leaves, he will lose his faith.

42:45.733 --> 42:48.742
And there's, uh...

42:48.743 --> 42:51.672
there's something worse.

42:51.673 --> 42:53.562
Um...

42:53.563 --> 42:57.572
And this you'll understand all too well.

42:57.573 --> 43:01.662
If Hawk walks away, he
doesn't just lose his faith,

43:01.663 --> 43:04.662
he loses his family.

43:06.663 --> 43:09.592
His mother.

43:09.593 --> 43:11.722
His father.

43:11.723 --> 43:14.642
His sister.

43:14.643 --> 43:17.642
His grandparents.

43:17.643 --> 43:20.542
His cousins.

43:22.673 --> 43:28.552
Now, you know what it is
to lose a parent, Ashley.

43:28.553 --> 43:32.562
It is...

43:32.563 --> 43:35.562
boundless fucking grief.

43:38.653 --> 43:41.652
Imagine losing your whole family.

43:45.723 --> 43:47.752
And, yes,

43:47.753 --> 43:51.632
Hawk may come to this decision
anyway, someday, but...

43:54.673 --> 43:56.672
Is he ready

43:56.673 --> 43:58.652
to come to it now?

44:04.543 --> 44:06.582
Steve has finished writing
the last three rungs...

44:07.603 --> 44:09.572
And you have my word,

44:09.573 --> 44:12.582
they are revolutionary.

44:12.583 --> 44:16.572
Now, the Movement is about
to undergo tremendous change,

44:16.573 --> 44:17.592
and this is the place

44:17.593 --> 44:18.602
where it'll happen.

44:20.683 --> 44:23.632
- Babe.
- Yeah?

44:23.633 --> 44:24.712
Hello.

44:24.713 --> 44:27.582
Hey, Fredericks.

44:27.583 --> 44:29.662
So, hey.

44:29.663 --> 44:31.612
What brings you to this
ends of the earth, huh?

44:31.613 --> 44:36.522
That coroner report from Peru, Jason Kemp.

44:36.523 --> 44:38.662
- I'm off the case.
- Yeah, I know.

44:38.663 --> 44:40.582
You want some coffee? Or a beer?

44:40.583 --> 44:42.712
No, my lady's in the car. Date night.

44:42.713 --> 44:44.693
Mm.

44:46.683 --> 44:47.742
It's that good, huh?

44:47.743 --> 44:49.592
I don't know about "good."

44:49.593 --> 44:51.602
"Weird." It's weird.

44:51.603 --> 44:53.552
You tell me how a guy
burns his hands like this

44:53.553 --> 44:55.612
falling off a mountain.

44:55.613 --> 44:59.522
Anyway, I thought you'd want to see it.

44:59.523 --> 45:02.683
- My man.
- My man.

45:22.603 --> 45:24.742
Hawk's back.

45:24.743 --> 45:27.702
- Hey.
- Ah.

45:27.703 --> 45:30.642
Hey.

45:30.643 --> 45:33.652
What's going on, kid?

45:35.683 --> 45:37.582
Hey, hey.

45:37.583 --> 45:39.592
Talk to me.

45:42.593 --> 45:46.603
Could you just give us a second, Summer?

45:48.643 --> 45:50.712
Hey.

45:50.713 --> 45:54.532
Ashley broke up with me.

45:58.553 --> 46:00.632
Come here. Come here, come here.

46:04.563 --> 46:06.542
I'm sorry.

46:08.583 --> 46:12.522
Hey.

46:12.523 --> 46:13.652
It's like one moment,

46:13.653 --> 46:15.542
I'm the most important thing in the world,

46:15.543 --> 46:18.572
and the next time...

46:18.573 --> 46:22.522
too much responsibility.

46:22.523 --> 46:23.662
What's too much responsibility?

46:23.663 --> 46:26.652
Me.

46:26.653 --> 46:30.582
Giving up my life for her.

46:30.583 --> 46:32.752
Look, she's just going
through a lot with her family

46:32.753 --> 46:34.552
right now, all right?

46:34.553 --> 46:36.662
Yeah.

46:36.663 --> 46:41.722
And she kept going on and
on about how I was special

46:41.723 --> 46:45.622
because Meyerism is special.

46:45.623 --> 46:47.702
She doesn't even like Meyerism.

46:47.703 --> 46:49.532
It made no sense. She...

46:49.533 --> 46:50.712
- What?
- She said Meyerism

46:50.713 --> 46:52.582
was the part of me that mattered

46:52.583 --> 46:54.682
and that she didn't want to take that away.

47:01.613 --> 47:03.633
Watch your sister.

47:08.663 --> 47:10.652
We will present it all
at our next gathering.

47:10.653 --> 47:13.732
Then... then we will celebrate,

47:13.733 --> 47:15.622
because Steve will be here.

47:15.623 --> 47:18.562
Steve is... Steve's coming?

47:21.753 --> 47:24.602
Eddie, thank you for coming.

47:24.603 --> 47:28.562
What did you do to get
Ashley to break up with Hawk?

47:30.673 --> 47:32.522
- You had him do it?
- Eddie...

47:32.523 --> 47:34.542
Fuck you, Cal.

47:35.743 --> 47:39.662
You broke your son's heart.

47:39.663 --> 47:41.582
It was for the best.

47:41.583 --> 47:44.562
It was for the best?

47:44.563 --> 47:48.712
What, so he can end up like you?

47:48.713 --> 47:50.712
All of you?

47:50.713 --> 47:53.622
Just a prisoner.

47:53.623 --> 47:54.662
A bunch of fucking prisoners.

47:54.663 --> 47:55.702
Okay, Eddie, let's go.

47:58.743 --> 48:01.712
Come on. You're okay.

48:01.713 --> 48:04.552
Come on. Cal, are you all right?

48:21.743 --> 48:24.642
Evening.

48:28.663 --> 48:29.672
Can I help you?

48:32.623 --> 48:33.672
Yeah.
