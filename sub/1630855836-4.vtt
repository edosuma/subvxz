WEBVTT

00:02.169 --> 00:03.068
- All I ever wanted
from the first time I sat

00:03.204 --> 00:04.102
In the glider room cadets
was to fly.

00:04.138 --> 00:05.470
- Got it!
- Now that's some real

00:05.506 --> 00:07.373
Bush pilot shit.
- What were you doing up

00:07.508 --> 00:09.307
In that fire tower?
- I was trying to simulate
a spacewalk.

00:09.343 --> 00:10.709
- He was already cut
from selection camp

00:10.778 --> 00:13.312
Before his accident.

00:13.314 --> 00:14.880
- Whoa, what are you doing?
- Trust me!

00:15.015 --> 00:16.515
- Chops, you found them.
- Tristan told you

00:16.517 --> 00:18.784
About the kiss...
- Hey, hey! Novak!

00:18.786 --> 00:20.519
- My oncologist suggested
a preventative

00:20.654 --> 00:23.088
Double mastectomy.
- You camping out here, boss?

00:23.124 --> 00:25.957
- Lynn and I separated.
- Hey, wheezer, I...

00:25.993 --> 00:27.325
- I didn't mean to upset you.

00:27.461 --> 00:29.360
I'm kinglsey. I'm your father.

00:30.597 --> 00:32.898
- Good to have you back
in the saddle, chops.

00:32.967 --> 00:34.532
- I leave you alone
for a couple of months

00:34.568 --> 00:36.167
And suddenly
you're flying livestock.

00:37.204 --> 00:39.204
- Okay, first off,
that is not livestock.

00:39.339 --> 00:40.739
That is an emotional
support animal.

00:40.741 --> 00:42.808
And she... Has a name.

00:42.810 --> 00:44.143
Isn't that right, penny?

00:44.145 --> 00:45.477
(clucking)
- don't worry, stu.

00:45.513 --> 00:47.145
Penny is right here
beside you,

00:47.214 --> 00:49.013
You're going to be just fine.
- Penny?

00:51.352 --> 00:53.651
- And if he isn't,
we'll have fresh eggs for weeks.

00:53.687 --> 00:55.954
(chuckling)

00:55.990 --> 00:57.556
(plane engine revving)

00:57.625 --> 00:59.157
- I need a scalpel.
- What, why?

00:59.193 --> 01:00.692
Where are you gonna cut him?
- Wheezer,

01:00.761 --> 01:02.760
We're running out of time.
Scalpel, please, thank you.

01:02.797 --> 01:04.162
- God, this does not look good.

01:04.198 --> 01:06.431
- Now I just need
to pack the wound.

01:06.500 --> 01:07.899
- Look, as a pilot,

01:07.968 --> 01:09.501
I can tell you that this
is not structurally sound.

01:09.537 --> 01:11.170
- And as a former
labour and delivery nurse,

01:11.172 --> 01:13.105
I can tell you,
a lot more can fit in here.

01:13.174 --> 01:15.174
- Where? You're already
in him up to your elbow.

01:15.309 --> 01:17.175
- I can't believe
you convinced me

01:17.211 --> 01:19.377
To stuff breakables
into a pinata.

01:19.447 --> 01:21.313
Somebody is definitely
going to get hurt tonight.

01:21.382 --> 01:23.248
- You know what?
It is not a celebration

01:23.317 --> 01:26.318
Without a pinata
or my famous jet fuel.

01:26.387 --> 01:27.986
- You know, it's sweet.

01:27.988 --> 01:29.521
You organizing all this.

01:29.557 --> 01:32.591
- Well, it's the fun part
of my chief pilot duties.

01:32.660 --> 01:34.726
Can be hard feeling like
you're kind of moving backwards.

01:34.728 --> 01:35.994
Moving into the new version

01:36.030 --> 01:37.529
Of the old house
you used to live in.

01:37.531 --> 01:39.164
Going back to the job
you used to work.

01:39.299 --> 01:41.199
- Oh, wheezer...
- Oh, no, no, no.

01:41.235 --> 01:42.934
No, no, not me. I just
keep getting better and better.

01:43.070 --> 01:44.636
- Ah!
- You can't regress

01:44.672 --> 01:46.738
If you never left.
-<i> Tower, this is ghost rider.</i>

01:46.740 --> 01:47.906
<i> Requesting a fly-by.</i>

01:48.041 --> 01:50.275
- Um, ghost rider, uh, negative.

01:50.311 --> 01:52.144
The pattern is full.
We're not ready.

01:52.213 --> 01:53.311
<i> (crystal): Too late, nerds.</i>
<i> They're already</i>

01:53.380 --> 01:54.479
<i> At the front door, incoming.</i>

01:54.482 --> 01:56.348
(door opens)
- shh...

01:56.350 --> 01:58.083
- Well, just five more
minutes without a call,

01:58.218 --> 02:00.018
And we are officially
off the clock.

02:00.087 --> 02:02.087
- How does it feel
to be back, bro?

02:02.089 --> 02:03.689
- Feels like I never left.

02:03.824 --> 02:05.957
It's all... Kind of...

02:05.993 --> 02:07.759
- Same old, same old?

02:07.795 --> 02:09.427
- I was going to say
routine, but, yeah.

02:09.463 --> 02:10.762
- Well, I guess after
selection camp,

02:10.898 --> 02:13.631
Flying medevacs probably
isn't that exciting.

02:13.667 --> 02:16.501
- No. No, boring's good.

02:16.537 --> 02:18.170
If we're doing everything right,
should be boring, right?

02:19.273 --> 02:21.072
- Hmm.
- Uh, you remember

02:21.142 --> 02:23.308
If we have any day-old
pizza in the fridge?

02:25.279 --> 02:27.713
(all screaming "surprise")

02:27.848 --> 02:30.582
(cheering)

02:30.618 --> 02:32.617
(rhythmic music)

02:40.894 --> 02:42.460
(hip-hop music playing)

02:48.002 --> 02:50.101
- Ah, young love.

02:50.171 --> 02:52.304
When everything was
so new and exciting.

02:52.306 --> 02:53.872
- Yeah, well, practice
makes perfect.

02:54.007 --> 02:55.140
- Oh, yeah?
- Watch your six.

02:55.275 --> 02:56.908
Coolant, coming through.

02:59.613 --> 03:01.880
Eight months of winter's
gotta have some perks, right?

03:02.783 --> 03:04.415
(phone chimes)
oh, sorry.

03:04.451 --> 03:06.084
Gotta take this.
My boyfriend's working nights.

03:06.219 --> 03:07.452
We gotta talk
when he's on a break.

03:08.789 --> 03:10.722
- Boyfriend, huh?

03:10.758 --> 03:14.593
So... That means you're going
to relax now, right?

03:14.595 --> 03:16.228
And start being nice
to the guy

03:16.297 --> 03:18.563
We used to be really
good friends with...

03:18.632 --> 03:20.199
Right?

03:21.501 --> 03:23.501
You can trust him.
You guys have been really tight.

03:23.537 --> 03:25.437
- I trust you.

03:25.572 --> 03:26.972
Because we tell
each other everything.

03:28.209 --> 03:30.775
- Wheezer!
- Hey! Watch it.

03:30.811 --> 03:32.444
Combustible goods here, man.

03:32.513 --> 03:33.979
Hey, martine,
you got a sec?

03:33.981 --> 03:36.314
- Hey, I was definitely

03:36.450 --> 03:37.783
Just about to try some
of that jet fuel.

03:37.918 --> 03:39.985
- Well, it's a good thing
I grabbed you for a talk first.

03:39.987 --> 03:41.453
Um, now that chopper's back,

03:41.522 --> 03:43.789
I got one too many medevac
pilots on the line

03:43.791 --> 03:45.490
So someone's got to go.

03:45.492 --> 03:47.459
- I know I haven't been
flight line as long as chopper,

03:47.528 --> 03:49.061
But I have a lot of hours,
like, I'm a good pilot.

03:49.196 --> 03:51.496
- Hey, you were a great pilot,
lexi.

03:51.498 --> 03:54.932
The emergency landing,
that whole snake thing.

03:54.969 --> 03:56.201
It's just that chopper
was technically

03:56.270 --> 03:57.935
Only on leave,
and he has seniority

03:57.972 --> 03:59.070
On the medevac.

04:01.075 --> 04:02.407
So I guess I gotta
promote you.

04:03.510 --> 04:04.676
- I don't understand.

04:04.678 --> 04:06.044
- You think like
a bush pilot, lexi.

04:06.179 --> 04:08.246
And a driver is not
a real pilot

04:08.282 --> 04:09.447
Until they've flown
cargo in the north.

04:09.449 --> 04:10.949
So I'm putting you solo

04:11.018 --> 04:12.818
On the 200 for cargo runs,

04:12.953 --> 04:14.686
Captain martine.

04:14.821 --> 04:16.354
(exhales deeply)

04:17.557 --> 04:19.357
- Thank you, thank you
for this opportunity, sir.

04:19.359 --> 04:20.592
I will not let you down, sir.

04:20.661 --> 04:22.027
- You literally
just watched me pour

04:22.029 --> 04:23.561
Grape jell-o powder
into a vat of tequila,

04:23.597 --> 04:25.496
So I think we can
lay off the "sir" stuff.

04:26.467 --> 04:27.899
And I know that you
won't let me down

04:27.968 --> 04:29.434
Because there are 20 other guys

04:29.470 --> 04:32.103
Waiting on that ramp
to replace you if you do.

04:32.139 --> 04:33.772
- Alright?
- Thank you, sir.

04:33.841 --> 04:36.007
I mean, wheezer.

04:36.844 --> 04:39.745
- Crys? You okay?

04:39.880 --> 04:42.080
Jeremy told me things
ended with you.

04:43.317 --> 04:44.849
If you need someone
to talk to...

04:47.888 --> 04:49.321
<i> (voice over earphones):</i>
<i> ...The regulation</i>

04:49.390 --> 04:50.956
<i> Of epinephrine and no--</i>

04:50.958 --> 04:52.557
- Are you studying?

04:54.295 --> 04:55.927
- I have an exam this week.

04:55.929 --> 04:58.396
And with skymed, and clinical,
and lectures,

04:58.432 --> 05:00.665
I haven't had time to sleep,
let alone study

05:00.668 --> 05:03.234
And everyone keeps dragging
me back to the party.

05:03.304 --> 05:05.069
And I want to be there, trist,
I do.

05:05.105 --> 05:06.805
I just don't...
- Just, just...

05:06.807 --> 05:09.241
Take my car.

05:09.243 --> 05:11.509
Go to the java house,
it's quiet there.

05:12.913 --> 05:14.145
I can keep a secret.

05:15.182 --> 05:16.081
- Thank you.

05:17.918 --> 05:19.851
(laughing)
thank you.

05:26.160 --> 05:27.893
(chuckling)

05:28.028 --> 05:29.794
- I've been trying to get
you alone all night.

05:30.764 --> 05:31.830
- Reese?

05:31.965 --> 05:33.698
(chuckling)

05:33.767 --> 05:35.099
- Grab us a drink?

05:35.135 --> 05:36.200
- Okay.

05:37.805 --> 05:38.937
- Thought you had
a boyfriend.

05:39.072 --> 05:40.471
- I do, we're open.

05:42.109 --> 05:43.642
I know nowie is pretty
traditional,

05:43.644 --> 05:45.910
But you know that's not
the only way

05:45.946 --> 05:47.312
To be in a relationship.

05:47.314 --> 05:49.381
There are a lot
of other options, tristan.

05:49.450 --> 05:51.015
Hmm?

05:55.121 --> 05:57.322
(indistinct chatter)

05:57.324 --> 05:59.891
(chuckling)

05:59.960 --> 06:02.894
- Is that a peace offering
for not trying the "jet fuel"

06:03.029 --> 06:05.130
Because my forgiveness
is not for sale.

06:05.265 --> 06:08.132
(scoffs)
- it's actually a peace lily.

06:08.168 --> 06:10.001
They fill the air with oxygen

06:10.070 --> 06:11.870
And are almost
impossible to kill.

06:11.939 --> 06:13.605
Like certain chief pilots.

06:13.607 --> 06:15.107
- Hmm.
- Welcome to the crew house.

06:15.976 --> 06:17.742
- Well, colour me "impressed."

06:17.811 --> 06:19.076
Where in the hell
did you get

06:19.113 --> 06:21.112
A house plant in thompson?

06:21.115 --> 06:23.615
- I... Might have
brought it up

06:23.617 --> 06:25.583
On the medevac from winnipeg.
- Oh!

06:25.619 --> 06:27.185
- But hey!
It's not every day

06:27.320 --> 06:29.087
You graduate from
vagrant couch surfer

06:29.222 --> 06:31.356
To full room
in a pilot flop-house.

06:31.491 --> 06:32.891
- Wow!

06:32.960 --> 06:34.860
Shots fired.

06:34.862 --> 06:36.528
Don't make me write you up
for insubordination.

06:36.663 --> 06:38.162
- Oh, you wouldn't.
- Oh, I might.

06:38.298 --> 06:39.330
- Really?
- Yeah.

06:39.366 --> 06:41.466
- I dare you.
You're not my boss.

06:43.504 --> 06:45.237
- No,

06:45.372 --> 06:46.371
I'm not your boss.

06:46.373 --> 06:48.506
(soft music)

06:49.877 --> 06:51.710
(chuckling)

06:52.646 --> 06:53.578
- Incoming!

06:56.150 --> 06:58.983
- Uh, do you know how often
I'm going to need to water this,

06:59.052 --> 07:00.718
Because if it's more than...

07:00.720 --> 07:02.286
Well, never,
I'm not sure how...

07:03.457 --> 07:04.922
This is going to go.

07:10.130 --> 07:13.331
(upbeat rock music)

07:33.520 --> 07:36.621
(panting)

07:36.623 --> 07:37.622
- Damn it.

07:40.427 --> 07:42.027
(groans)

07:49.569 --> 07:53.304
(rock music)

07:57.176 --> 07:58.075
- We're closed.

07:59.279 --> 08:01.179
- I only need a minute.
- I thought I was clear.

08:01.314 --> 08:02.714
I don't want anything
to do with you.

08:02.783 --> 08:04.950
- Yes, you were clear,
but I didn't get the chance

08:04.952 --> 08:07.052
To say everything
that I needed to say.

08:07.187 --> 08:09.086
Austen, I never
stopped looking for you.

08:10.123 --> 08:11.589
The moment I found out
your name

08:11.658 --> 08:13.892
And where you were
after all these years--

08:13.894 --> 08:16.060
- Yeah, 25 years and 9 months
since you walked out on my mom.

08:16.096 --> 08:18.029
- I never knew
she was pregnant.

08:18.065 --> 08:19.197
Austen, she sent me a letter,

08:19.332 --> 08:22.600
But I did not get it
until after you were born.

08:22.636 --> 08:25.103
After she was forced
to give you up.

08:25.172 --> 08:26.938
- Yeah, cool story. I'm not
giving you my kidney, man.

08:30.244 --> 08:32.777
- I was 17 years old.

08:32.779 --> 08:34.946
I'd only been in this country
for a few months.

08:34.948 --> 08:36.480
I went to work on the oil sands.

08:36.517 --> 08:38.149
- That's your excuse?

08:38.185 --> 08:40.018
That it wasn't my fault,
I was just a kid,

08:40.020 --> 08:41.352
I didn't know.
You were busy doing

08:41.421 --> 08:42.954
Something else
when my mom needed you.

08:44.157 --> 08:45.823
You know what?
Thanks for clearing this up.

08:45.859 --> 08:47.425
You can go now.

08:49.096 --> 08:51.495
(soft emotional music)

09:10.384 --> 09:11.582
<i> - Tansi, kookoo.</i>

09:12.619 --> 09:14.585
- Crystal!

09:14.621 --> 09:17.455
I didn't know you
were coming,<i> nôsisim.</i>

09:17.491 --> 09:19.857
- Yeah, that's the only
way I catch you napping.

09:19.927 --> 09:22.226
Usually, you're too busy
to sit down.

09:23.030 --> 09:25.530
- Oh, I'm so glad you're here.

09:26.766 --> 09:28.066
I made something for you.

09:32.940 --> 09:34.539
- Oh, they're beautiful,<i> kookoo.</i>

09:34.674 --> 09:36.541
- Oh, you're so busy
these days.

09:36.676 --> 09:38.142
For a clear head.

09:40.280 --> 09:42.346
(speaking nêhiyawêwin)

09:44.517 --> 09:46.151
(in english): I am tired.

09:46.286 --> 09:48.620
I just need a quiet place
to study before my shift starts

09:48.622 --> 09:50.354
And the crew house is packed.

09:53.893 --> 09:56.160
- Oh, black coffee?

09:56.196 --> 09:58.630
That crap's no good
for a clear head.

09:58.632 --> 10:00.098
And what have you been eating?

10:00.100 --> 10:01.633
You're too skinny,<i> nôsisim.</i>

10:02.669 --> 10:04.435
I've got some soup and bannock.

10:06.039 --> 10:07.772
- Thanks,<i> kookoo.</i>
I just...

10:07.774 --> 10:09.707
I need to study.

10:09.776 --> 10:12.176
- Don't forget, our medicines
were here long before

10:12.212 --> 10:13.778
What's written
in those books.

10:20.386 --> 10:22.120
(tense music)

10:27.160 --> 10:28.993
-<i> Kookoo,</i> need some help?

10:30.464 --> 10:32.397
- Is that gus and edna?

10:32.532 --> 10:33.865
- You're expecting visitors?

10:33.867 --> 10:36.468
- I don't need
to expect anyone.

10:36.470 --> 10:37.469
There's lots of soup.

10:39.039 --> 10:40.672
- I know, I just...

10:40.674 --> 10:42.207
I need to study.

10:42.342 --> 10:44.942
- Your heart needs things, too,
<i> nôsisim.</i>

10:44.978 --> 10:49.313
Got your head down so busy
trying to get somewhere.

10:49.349 --> 10:51.048
If you're not careful,
you'll forget to look up

10:51.084 --> 10:52.249
And see where you're going.

10:56.023 --> 10:57.822
- C'mon, stef.
My bars are going to be

10:57.957 --> 10:59.490
Covered by my reflective
vest anyway.

10:59.526 --> 11:01.659
- Yeah, but we'll
know they're there.

11:02.829 --> 11:06.498
Here's to the first day
of you living your dream.

11:06.500 --> 11:08.966
Captain martine.

11:09.102 --> 11:11.703
(laughing)

11:11.705 --> 11:13.337
- Package for you, lex,
came this morning.

11:13.373 --> 11:15.173
- Oh, I checked the skids
for deep lake,

11:15.308 --> 11:16.574
They could fit with the supplies
to north house.

11:16.643 --> 11:18.109
I'll take them up in one trip
instead of two.

11:18.244 --> 11:19.778
- Nice, we'll get it loaded.

11:19.913 --> 11:21.412
(sighs)

11:21.481 --> 11:22.980
- What's this?
- Oh!

11:23.050 --> 11:24.148
- A surprise?

11:27.454 --> 11:29.286
(scoffs)

11:30.724 --> 11:33.691
Uh, I hope you got a receipt
for these, they look used.

11:33.694 --> 11:35.460
- They're my dad's.

11:36.496 --> 11:38.262
"marti" was his call sign.

11:38.331 --> 11:39.931
He always said this
headset kept him safe

11:40.000 --> 11:40.998
And brought him luck.

11:43.003 --> 11:44.335
I called him last night
to tell him...

11:44.371 --> 11:46.271
He must have paid a fortune
to get them here.

11:47.741 --> 11:49.073
- That's one proud papa.

11:49.208 --> 11:50.508
Giving you his lucky headset.

11:51.712 --> 11:53.411
- Yeah... Well...

11:53.413 --> 11:55.846
Won't be much luck
if I'm late for my first run.

11:56.917 --> 11:58.349
Okay.

11:58.351 --> 12:00.184
- That's my girl pilot.
(chuckles)

12:02.756 --> 12:04.188
- Let's do this, dad.

12:08.161 --> 12:10.094
- Man, the signal
in here sucks.

12:10.130 --> 12:11.763
- I'm going to shove
that phone up your ass

12:11.765 --> 12:13.331
If you don't put it away.

12:13.466 --> 12:15.600
Alright, I'm going to head down,
check the levels

12:15.735 --> 12:17.502
Make sure these main valves
are off.

12:17.637 --> 12:19.036
It's the top one.

12:19.038 --> 12:20.504
And stay off the god damn phone.

12:22.309 --> 12:23.707
(phone notification)

12:25.512 --> 12:27.512
- Oh, yes.

12:27.514 --> 12:29.280
Maya finally hit me back.

12:29.983 --> 12:31.782
Whoa, a photo, what...

12:31.784 --> 12:33.518
(phone beeping)
girl, you know it's not fair.

12:33.653 --> 12:35.120
I don't get any signal out here.

12:35.255 --> 12:36.921
C'mon, c'mon.

12:36.957 --> 12:38.456
(air hissing)

12:38.458 --> 12:40.124
Ah, damn it.

12:42.696 --> 12:43.995
Good to go, boss.

12:46.466 --> 12:47.932
Hank?

12:48.067 --> 12:49.667
Hank!

12:51.238 --> 12:53.004
- Man, this place
smells pungent.

12:53.006 --> 12:54.705
- Yeah, that's the waste water.

12:56.443 --> 12:58.076
- The patient has a history
of heart problems.

12:58.211 --> 13:00.411
- Do you need us?
- Sounds like an arrest,

13:00.413 --> 13:02.280
But I'm gonna need help
getting him out of here.

13:02.282 --> 13:03.848
I'm heading down.

13:03.850 --> 13:05.550
- Alright, talk to me,
what do you think, chops?

13:05.685 --> 13:07.218
(gasps)

13:07.353 --> 13:08.753
(sighs)

13:08.822 --> 13:13.358
(indistinct chatter)

13:13.493 --> 13:15.092
(tense music)

13:16.162 --> 13:18.496
- Okay, almost ready.

13:18.498 --> 13:20.698
This will hold him, but we're
going to have to go slow.

13:20.700 --> 13:23.167
When crystal's got him
packaged, we'll load him up.

13:23.203 --> 13:24.902
Man, it's good to have you back,
chops.

13:25.038 --> 13:26.371
If I had been here alone,
we would've been

13:26.373 --> 13:28.505
Dragging this guy up
by his suspenders.

13:28.542 --> 13:30.674
Hey, crys, you ready?
We're sending down the litter.

13:33.547 --> 13:34.812
Crys?

13:36.650 --> 13:37.916
- Oh, god.

13:38.051 --> 13:39.083
- Crystal!

13:43.089 --> 13:44.856
- Crystal!

13:44.858 --> 13:46.724
- Bodes, bodes.
It's not safe.

13:46.726 --> 13:48.359
- Something's not right.
Hank's passed out first,

13:48.361 --> 13:49.927
Now crystal.
The rotten egg smell

13:49.996 --> 13:51.763
Could also mean
hydrogen sulfide.

13:51.765 --> 13:54.064
- Oh, god. I must have
turned the wrong valve.

13:54.100 --> 13:55.600
- What?
- I was supposed to turn

13:55.669 --> 13:57.402
The valves off,
but I was texting my girlfriend,

13:57.404 --> 13:58.837
And I must have
turned the wrong valve.

13:58.972 --> 14:00.605
- You're telling me you put
two people's lives in danger

14:00.674 --> 14:02.073
Because you were too busy
doing something else?

14:02.208 --> 14:03.875
- We gotta focus
on getting crystal out.

14:04.010 --> 14:06.010
- What about hank? He's been
down there for a long time.

14:06.145 --> 14:07.612
You've gotta help him.
- We gotta get our nurse

14:07.614 --> 14:09.347
Out first. She's the only
one that can help hank,

14:09.349 --> 14:11.081
So we have to make her
the priority, okay?

14:11.117 --> 14:12.950
But you can help me.
- Yeah, I'll turn off the gas.

14:13.019 --> 14:14.551
- No, it's too late for that.

14:14.588 --> 14:17.087
There has to be rebreathers
here, hazmat suits?

14:17.123 --> 14:18.422
- Yeah, hank showed me
on my first day.

14:18.458 --> 14:20.558
- Great. There has to be
a fire extinguisher nearby.

14:20.627 --> 14:22.093
Grab that. We have to dampen
any possible ignition points.

14:22.228 --> 14:23.594
- Okay.
- Go!

14:26.166 --> 14:28.700
(tense music)

14:30.503 --> 14:33.037
- I'm hosing it down.
I don't see any sparks.

14:34.707 --> 14:36.307
- Okay, just keep going.

14:37.878 --> 14:40.044
I'm almost to crystal.

14:45.218 --> 14:46.718
I've got her, bodie.

14:48.121 --> 14:49.453
Get the litter.

14:53.994 --> 14:55.592
- Coming up!

14:57.163 --> 14:58.329
You okay, crys?

14:58.464 --> 15:00.698
You okay?

15:00.767 --> 15:02.467
- I'm okay. I'm okay.

15:02.469 --> 15:03.767
- What about hank?

15:06.172 --> 15:07.571
- Pulse is good.

15:13.679 --> 15:16.113
(breathing shakily)

15:17.183 --> 15:18.683
- I just heard
from the hospital.

15:18.752 --> 15:20.818
Crys is okay and hank is... Too.

15:20.954 --> 15:22.486
Are you okay?

15:22.522 --> 15:24.355
- I screwed up, bodie.

15:25.625 --> 15:27.725
I screwed up. I just
thought it was a routine call.

15:27.761 --> 15:30.361
Like every other call.
And I didn't check the scene,

15:30.430 --> 15:31.896
I put crystal in danger.

15:31.898 --> 15:33.397
- Hey, that's on all of us.

15:33.399 --> 15:35.633
We all should have been
checking the scene.

15:35.635 --> 15:37.702
- I'm an engineer.
I should've known better.

15:37.771 --> 15:40.104
- Chopper, you figured out
how to save crystal.

15:42.375 --> 15:43.974
Dude...

15:44.644 --> 15:46.276
Are you okay?

15:49.983 --> 15:51.649
(exhales)

15:55.655 --> 15:57.722
- It was an impossible exercise.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.193
That's why I got cut
from selection camp.

16:03.263 --> 16:06.197
It didn't actually
have a solution.

16:06.266 --> 16:07.799
It was designed to test
how you'd respond

16:07.934 --> 16:09.867
When there is no solution.

16:10.002 --> 16:12.269
We didn't know that, you know?

16:14.741 --> 16:15.973
And I was doing so well...

16:17.477 --> 16:20.878
Proving to them
how smart I was, how...

16:20.914 --> 16:22.279
Good at solving problems.

16:24.084 --> 16:25.216
And uh...

16:26.519 --> 16:29.253
I really believed that,
despite all the signs,

16:30.857 --> 16:33.324
I could solve this one too.

16:33.326 --> 16:37.194
So I kept pushing my team
to keep going and going.

16:40.834 --> 16:42.633
Until someone died.

16:42.702 --> 16:44.168
(tense music)

16:45.838 --> 16:47.772
It was just a simulation.

16:47.907 --> 16:49.106
But if it had been real,

16:50.944 --> 16:52.310
If we were on the station,

16:54.314 --> 16:56.146
My teammate would have died
because of me.

16:57.984 --> 17:00.050
I didn't pay attention
to the signs.

17:00.186 --> 17:02.053
I just rushed in

17:02.055 --> 17:04.856
Trying to fix a problem
that couldn't be fixed.

17:04.991 --> 17:06.390
- Chopper...
- No, I was...

17:06.393 --> 17:09.226
I was at the fire tower
for that reason, bodie.

17:09.262 --> 17:10.461
I was trying to recreate
the exercise.

17:10.497 --> 17:12.729
I wanted to prove that
I could find a solution.

17:12.766 --> 17:14.932
(emotional music)

17:19.272 --> 17:21.672
If I'm not the guy
who can solve every problem...

17:21.674 --> 17:24.208
- Hey, hey...
Anyone can make a mistake.

17:24.244 --> 17:26.343
- Yeah, but... You got mad
at the kid at the plant

17:26.413 --> 17:27.979
For making a mistake.
How am I any different?

17:28.114 --> 17:29.347
- Because I know you, chopper.

17:29.349 --> 17:31.415
(sniffles)
I know that you're a good guy,

17:31.418 --> 17:33.017
And more importantly,
I know what's in your heart.

17:33.152 --> 17:35.219
- Yeah, well, I guess...

17:35.288 --> 17:37.288
If you knew that kid today,

17:38.992 --> 17:41.158
Maybe you wouldn't have
blamed him for a screw-up.

17:51.671 --> 17:54.071
- I heard you had a scare today.

17:54.074 --> 17:56.707
Also heard you didn't
let anyone check you out after.

17:58.078 --> 18:00.010
- Who told you?
- You did.

18:00.080 --> 18:01.445
Just now.

18:01.448 --> 18:03.180
(sighs)

18:03.249 --> 18:04.582
- I'm fine.

18:04.584 --> 18:06.317
In fact, passing out
from the gas leak

18:06.386 --> 18:08.453
Was the first sleep I've managed
to get in two days.

18:08.588 --> 18:10.454
- That's not funny, alright?
This is serious stuff, crys.

18:10.457 --> 18:12.189
You need to get looked at.
You can develop pulmonary edema

18:12.225 --> 18:14.192
Up to like...
72 hours after exposure

18:14.327 --> 18:16.661
To hydrogen sulfide. So...

18:16.796 --> 18:19.129
Can I? Hmm, hmm, hmm?

18:22.669 --> 18:24.402
- Okay.
- Yes, alright.

18:34.013 --> 18:35.546
(exhaling)

18:38.618 --> 18:40.050
- Did you just warm that up?

18:40.120 --> 18:42.953
(chuckles)
- yeah, you know me, crys.

18:42.989 --> 18:45.022
Me and my bedside manners.

18:47.994 --> 18:50.294
(soft music)

18:51.998 --> 18:53.363
So running into a gas pit

18:53.399 --> 18:55.032
And getting yourself
knocked out, huh?

18:56.102 --> 18:58.302
Sounds like something I'd do.

18:58.304 --> 19:00.237
- Yeah, I might have
been overdoing it.

19:00.372 --> 19:02.372
At school, work, it's...

19:02.408 --> 19:04.441
A lot.

19:04.443 --> 19:06.710
I was overtired and I forgot
to check the scene.

19:06.746 --> 19:08.145
- Just breathe, crys.

19:10.316 --> 19:12.917
(speaking nêhiyawêwin)

19:15.255 --> 19:16.921
(deep breath)

19:16.923 --> 19:20.123
(repeating in nêhiyawêwin)

19:25.098 --> 19:27.131
(deep breath)

19:27.133 --> 19:28.933
(in english): Yeah,
you need blood work done.

19:30.203 --> 19:32.569
Isabelle's right.
You're too skinny.

19:33.406 --> 19:35.072
Here.

19:35.141 --> 19:36.941
You forgot this
at her house.

19:36.943 --> 19:37.942
She wanted you to have it.

19:37.944 --> 19:39.843
- You were at isabelle's?

19:39.913 --> 19:41.745
- Yeah.
I'm there all the time.

19:43.149 --> 19:44.749
And you should go home more,
crys.

19:44.751 --> 19:46.083
I know she misses you.

19:48.321 --> 19:51.155
Look, I know you're busy
with all your medical exam

19:51.157 --> 19:52.489
And everything, but...

19:52.525 --> 19:53.690
Just...

19:55.428 --> 19:57.127
Just try not
to change too much, crys.

19:57.931 --> 19:59.230
- Well, which is it?

19:59.299 --> 20:01.832
Have I changed too much
or not enough?

20:01.834 --> 20:03.300
- What?
- You're the one who said

20:03.336 --> 20:04.501
I didn't change enough,
and now you're saying

20:04.537 --> 20:05.335
I changed too much?

20:06.806 --> 20:08.372
Look, I'm sorry
if I'm not juggling

20:08.441 --> 20:10.041
Med school, and family,

20:10.176 --> 20:12.509
And work exactly
how you want me to,

20:12.545 --> 20:14.645
But at least I didn't
just disappear

20:14.647 --> 20:16.313
And let people think
I was gone when I was at school.

20:21.921 --> 20:23.120
- Like I said,

20:23.122 --> 20:24.955
You should get your
blood work done.

20:31.330 --> 20:33.064
(sighs)

20:33.066 --> 20:36.133
(rhythmic music)

20:40.006 --> 20:41.806
- You got this, babe.
Be brave!

20:41.808 --> 20:44.609
- I can't believe you talked me
into coming out here today

20:44.744 --> 20:46.010
In this weather.

20:46.079 --> 20:47.811
- It's our anniversary!

20:47.813 --> 20:49.814
We gotta do something fun.

20:49.816 --> 20:51.649
There you go, just like that.

20:51.784 --> 20:53.551
(screaming)
- oh, my god, ted!

20:53.686 --> 20:55.553
- I got you. I got you.

20:55.688 --> 20:58.221
- We do not have
the same idea of fun.

20:58.258 --> 21:00.024
- Look at how far you've come.

21:00.093 --> 21:01.092
You're conquering your fear.

21:01.094 --> 21:02.360
- Oh, my god...

21:03.496 --> 21:05.162
- Yeah, there you go, babe.
You're doing it.

21:05.164 --> 21:07.130
You're almost at the top.

21:07.834 --> 21:09.500
Yes!

21:09.635 --> 21:11.668
Alright, hold on there.
I'm coming up after you.

21:13.306 --> 21:14.771
Come here.

21:14.807 --> 21:16.640
Check out that view.

21:16.643 --> 21:18.642
(chuckling)
- yeah.

21:18.711 --> 21:21.311
It's very pretty.
- I knew you'd love it.

21:21.347 --> 21:23.114
You know, watching you
be so brave today

21:23.249 --> 21:25.649
And conquer your fear,
taking that leap,

21:25.652 --> 21:27.785
It made me think
about another leap.

21:27.854 --> 21:29.453
The biggest leap.

21:29.522 --> 21:30.788
A leap we can take together.

21:30.790 --> 21:32.589
You gotta turn around.

21:32.659 --> 21:35.058
- What are you doing?
- Just turn around, trust me.

21:39.499 --> 21:40.598
(grunts)

21:41.401 --> 21:42.466
(thuds)

21:42.468 --> 21:43.333
- Ted?

21:44.670 --> 21:46.103
Ted!

21:54.480 --> 21:55.613
- I remember that look.

21:55.748 --> 21:57.414
First week flying cargo
by myself,

21:57.450 --> 21:59.150
You couldn't have knocked
the smile off my face

21:59.285 --> 22:01.252
With a two-by-four.
- Feels pretty good, boss.

22:01.254 --> 22:03.020
- You're doing pretty good.

22:03.089 --> 22:04.355
Nice work combining
the deep lake

22:04.490 --> 22:05.956
And the north house scheds.

22:06.092 --> 22:08.291
But don't go getting
too good at it.

22:08.428 --> 22:10.227
We don't need you
coming after my job.

22:10.263 --> 22:12.095
(laughing)

22:13.032 --> 22:14.731
Hey, hayley.

22:15.835 --> 22:17.067
- So the other night
at the party, that was...

22:17.136 --> 22:19.636
(chuckling)
that was funny.

22:19.672 --> 22:21.238
- Totally, totally.

22:21.374 --> 22:22.639
Just one of those funny moments.

22:22.675 --> 22:24.107
- Yeah, super funny.

22:24.243 --> 22:26.844
I mean we're co-workers
and, and...

22:26.979 --> 22:28.779
I just got to back work
after my surgical leave.

22:28.781 --> 22:29.947
- I'm going through a divorce.

22:30.082 --> 22:31.515
- You're going
through a divorce.

22:33.652 --> 22:35.186
Great. Well, it's nice to work,

22:35.321 --> 22:36.653
It's nice to work
with a professional.

22:36.689 --> 22:38.255
Just keep things
nice and simple.

22:38.257 --> 22:40.524
(beeping)
- yeah, just, uh...

22:41.861 --> 22:43.327
Two professionals...

22:43.329 --> 22:44.962
"professionaling."

22:45.031 --> 22:46.864
- Yeah.
(nervous chuckling)

22:46.933 --> 22:48.599
Great, okay. Good talk.

22:48.601 --> 22:50.066
- Yes.

22:51.237 --> 22:52.836
- Thank god you're here.

22:52.905 --> 22:54.771
- Hey, ted.
I'm hayley, I'm a nurse.

22:56.008 --> 22:57.608
- My lower back and legs
are killing me.

22:57.743 --> 22:59.210
I think I broke something.

22:59.345 --> 23:00.811
- Okay, I'm going
to take a look, alright?

23:00.946 --> 23:04.114
(ted groans)

23:04.150 --> 23:05.950
Oh, okay. I think you might
have a broken pelvis.

23:05.952 --> 23:07.818
Your left side feels spongy.

23:07.820 --> 23:09.252
- Bones can be spongy?

23:10.423 --> 23:12.523
- Can you help me bind him?
- Oh, yeah.

23:13.659 --> 23:16.160
- I knew rock climbing
was a bad idea.

23:16.162 --> 23:18.395
He tried to convince me
on our first date

23:18.398 --> 23:19.963
That it was fun.
- Well...

23:19.999 --> 23:21.866
- I just don't understand
how you slipped,

23:22.001 --> 23:23.567
You're always so surefooted.

23:23.569 --> 23:26.303
I'm the clumsy one.
- I, uh...

23:27.774 --> 23:29.106
Was looking for this.

23:29.175 --> 23:31.041
- Ted...

23:31.177 --> 23:33.009
- I guess after all this,
you better open it, huh?

23:35.514 --> 23:37.013
- Oh, my god.

23:39.152 --> 23:40.651
You idiot!
(ted laughs)

23:40.786 --> 23:42.786
Why would you do this here?

23:42.788 --> 23:44.721
- Because on our first date,

23:44.791 --> 23:47.324
When I looked at you
and you were being so sassy

23:47.393 --> 23:50.194
And brave, even though
you were terrified,

23:50.196 --> 23:52.196
I knew right then
I wanted to marry you.

23:52.198 --> 23:55.065
So, will you take
this leap with me?

23:55.201 --> 23:56.933
- Of course, I'll marry you.

23:57.069 --> 23:59.537
(soft music)

24:10.015 --> 24:11.348
- Do you think your parents

24:11.417 --> 24:13.049
Can get along
or should we elope?

24:14.220 --> 24:16.253
- You know, I was thinking
we should go skydiving

24:16.255 --> 24:17.921
For the honeymoon.
(laughing)

24:17.990 --> 24:19.523
(groans)

24:19.658 --> 24:20.957
It's getting bad.

24:20.993 --> 24:22.827
- I'll top off your meds.

24:22.962 --> 24:24.695
- My chest feels tight.

24:24.697 --> 24:26.963
(machines beeping)

24:26.999 --> 24:29.699
- Your pressure's falling.
Hr's spiking.

24:29.735 --> 24:31.935
(ted panting)

24:34.874 --> 24:37.241
(ted groans)
his abdomen's rigid.

24:37.243 --> 24:39.910
- What does that mean?
- You need fluids, ted.

24:39.979 --> 24:41.444
I'm going to put
a pressure bag on your iv

24:41.481 --> 24:43.780
To get them into you fast,
and we'll keep refilling it.

24:43.816 --> 24:45.916
- What's happening?
Why does it keep doing that?

24:46.051 --> 24:48.151
(panting)
- I want to marry you.

24:48.187 --> 24:51.188
- I know, booboo.
You've had a lot of meds.

24:51.190 --> 24:52.923
But you proposed, remember?

24:53.058 --> 24:54.825
I said, "yes."

24:54.894 --> 24:56.593
(panting)
- I wanna marry you now.

24:58.865 --> 25:00.130
How much did you give him?

25:00.867 --> 25:03.267
(groans)

25:03.269 --> 25:05.201
(beeping)

25:05.238 --> 25:07.304
What do we do?
- I keep pushing fluids

25:07.439 --> 25:08.371
And we get him to an or.

25:09.608 --> 25:11.207
Fast.
- But he's going to make it

25:11.244 --> 25:12.810
To the hospital, right?

25:15.948 --> 25:18.114
I want to marry you now, too.

25:18.918 --> 25:20.284
- You want me to what?

25:20.286 --> 25:21.885
- He's got an internal bleed,
wheezer.

25:22.020 --> 25:23.753
And by how fast he's tanking...

25:25.892 --> 25:27.290
Look, I'm pushing fluids,

25:27.292 --> 25:28.659
But he needs to get to an or

25:28.794 --> 25:31.261
As soon as possible.
Look, you're a captain.

25:31.264 --> 25:33.430
Captains can marry people.
- Maybe on a boat.

25:33.466 --> 25:34.898
Not on an airplane.

25:35.468 --> 25:36.800
Marriage...

25:38.170 --> 25:40.437
It didn't really
work out for me.

25:40.506 --> 25:43.840
Think chopper's your guy.
- Uh, hashtag same, buddy.

25:43.910 --> 25:46.110
Besides, you're the captain.

25:46.245 --> 25:47.711
- Ah, he's crashing, wheezer.

25:47.713 --> 25:49.780
This could be their last chance.

25:49.782 --> 25:51.582
Come on, it doesn't matter
if it's a real wedding.

25:51.717 --> 25:53.984
This could be the only
wedding our patient gets.

25:54.921 --> 25:56.553
Please.

25:56.556 --> 25:57.888
(sighs)

25:59.292 --> 26:01.859
- Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here today

26:01.994 --> 26:04.127
To medevac this man...

26:04.931 --> 26:07.264
And also to marry him.

26:07.399 --> 26:10.200
To marry him to olivia.

26:10.335 --> 26:11.735
Olivia and...

26:12.505 --> 26:14.605
This man, this...
- Ted.

26:14.607 --> 26:16.506
- Ted! Ted.

26:16.542 --> 26:19.676
We are here today
to unite olivia and ted

26:19.745 --> 26:21.011
In a matrimony that is...

26:21.948 --> 26:23.681
Well, neither holy nor legal.

26:24.816 --> 26:26.684
(wheezing)

26:28.754 --> 26:29.719
But...

26:30.889 --> 26:33.490
By a matrimony grounded
in the power of the love

26:33.626 --> 26:34.692
That you have for one another.

26:36.295 --> 26:39.229
And we all know
that love is holier and stronger

26:39.231 --> 26:41.098
Than any law could ever be.

26:44.103 --> 26:46.036
So there is only really one...

26:47.039 --> 26:48.672
Important question
that matters today.

26:50.610 --> 26:51.909
Olivia, do you take ted?

26:52.044 --> 26:54.778
- I do! I do.

26:54.913 --> 26:56.346
- And ted, do you take olivia?

26:57.816 --> 27:00.350
- There's never been anyone
but you, liv...

27:00.386 --> 27:02.185
Ever since the first day...

27:03.789 --> 27:04.455
It's always been you.

27:05.191 --> 27:06.723
- I love you.

27:06.792 --> 27:08.125
- Then by the power
vested in me

27:08.260 --> 27:09.626
By your willingness to...

27:10.829 --> 27:12.195
Take this leap together,

27:14.733 --> 27:15.666
I now pronounce you married.

27:15.801 --> 27:18.535
(crying)

27:20.272 --> 27:21.304
- Thank you.

27:24.610 --> 27:26.609
(olivia sobbing)

27:28.847 --> 27:31.247
(door opens and closes)

27:34.854 --> 27:36.553
- Hayley?
- Hey.

27:36.555 --> 27:38.155
You're up late.

27:38.157 --> 27:40.090
- I couldn't sleep
without knowing about ted.

27:41.293 --> 27:43.093
It's my first wedding,
and I don't think I could

27:43.129 --> 27:44.828
Handle it if it ended up
in a funeral.

27:44.897 --> 27:46.629
- Well, I waited until
he was out of surgery.

27:46.666 --> 27:49.966
And as long as he doesn't
actually go skydiving

27:49.968 --> 27:52.035
For the honeymoon,
he looks good.

27:52.170 --> 27:54.104
- I guess...

27:54.106 --> 27:55.439
They're probably gonna
want to get married

27:55.441 --> 27:57.173
By a real officiant then.
- Yeah.

27:57.209 --> 27:59.042
Thank you for today.

27:59.045 --> 28:00.443
- No.
- It meant a lot to them.

28:00.445 --> 28:02.045
- And to me.

28:04.650 --> 28:07.684
You know, sometimes, this job
makes you realize that...

28:08.787 --> 28:10.286
Life is too short.

28:11.123 --> 28:12.989
In a bad way, you know?

28:13.125 --> 28:13.724
- Mm-hmm.

28:14.960 --> 28:16.793
- But then sometimes
it makes you realize that...

28:18.898 --> 28:20.697
Life is too short.

28:22.134 --> 28:23.099
In a good way.

28:24.203 --> 28:25.502
- Mm-hmm.

28:28.007 --> 28:31.141
(rhythmic emotional music)

28:55.334 --> 28:57.100
- Are you okay?
Do you want to stop?

28:57.103 --> 28:58.401
- Yeah, no, no. It's, um...

29:00.172 --> 29:03.874
I haven't... I haven't been
with anyone since my surgery.

29:03.943 --> 29:06.442
- It's okay.
We don't have to do this.

29:06.444 --> 29:07.678
- No. I want to,

29:07.813 --> 29:09.580
And-and I want it
to be with you.

29:09.582 --> 29:11.181
I just...

29:12.551 --> 29:14.051
I don't know.

29:19.825 --> 29:21.391
- Go ahead, you can touch it.

29:23.462 --> 29:26.196
It used to be a zipper,
but I had it removed.

29:41.614 --> 29:43.980
(♪♪)

29:56.762 --> 29:58.061
Can I?

30:06.839 --> 30:08.638
You're so beautiful, hayley.

30:22.721 --> 30:24.120
- Okay...
(panting)

30:27.726 --> 30:30.193
(distant wolf howling)

30:35.668 --> 30:37.267
- Evening.

30:37.303 --> 30:39.203
(ominous music)

30:39.338 --> 30:40.537
- Oh, hey.

30:41.574 --> 30:42.606
You're waiting
for cargo on this sched?

30:43.709 --> 30:44.408
- You're not from here.

30:46.278 --> 30:48.212
- You really shouldn't be
near the planes.

30:48.347 --> 30:49.812
Ramps are restricted.

30:51.517 --> 30:53.083
- They let you fly this thing
by yourself?

30:54.520 --> 30:55.919
- No.

30:55.921 --> 30:59.022
Terry should be here
any minute.

30:59.157 --> 31:01.291
And he does not like people
on his ramp.

31:05.697 --> 31:07.697
- I don't see anyone here
but you and me.

31:07.699 --> 31:09.366
- He'll be here.

31:09.368 --> 31:12.236
And there expecting us asap
at prospect river so...

31:24.316 --> 31:27.517
(humming)

31:28.854 --> 31:31.655
Okay, check. Check.

31:31.724 --> 31:33.523
Good, good.

31:33.559 --> 31:35.592
Nice. Nice.

31:35.727 --> 31:37.394
Good job, lexi.

31:37.396 --> 31:39.363
- Can I catch a lift with you
to prospect river?

31:39.498 --> 31:40.163
- Oh!

31:42.167 --> 31:43.733
- If you need to get
to prospect river,

31:43.769 --> 31:45.869
You can book a passenger
flight tomorrow.

31:48.273 --> 31:50.073
It's against regulations.

31:50.109 --> 31:51.875
Cargo flights have guidelines

31:51.944 --> 31:53.877
And weight restrictions.

31:54.012 --> 31:56.079
- You're telling me
this plane's overweight?

31:57.850 --> 31:59.416
You think I'm an idiot?
- No.

31:59.485 --> 32:01.384
No.

32:01.420 --> 32:03.987
I'm just not allowed
to take passengers.

32:05.023 --> 32:06.155
It...

32:06.191 --> 32:07.957
The plane isn't approved
for that

32:09.194 --> 32:10.526
- I'll get off
in prospect river.

32:12.331 --> 32:14.164
I want to ride with you.

32:15.167 --> 32:17.000
(buckle clicks)

32:19.772 --> 32:21.771
(radio chatter)

32:23.375 --> 32:25.842
(man speaking indistinctly)

32:29.648 --> 32:30.914
- What are you doing?

32:31.049 --> 32:32.281
- I've been talking to you.

32:35.287 --> 32:37.153
- I-I need to hear the radio.

32:39.491 --> 32:40.691
- Want some?

32:47.933 --> 32:49.799
You lactose intolerant?

32:49.835 --> 32:51.634
A lot of people are.

32:54.473 --> 32:55.672
That big lever,

32:55.807 --> 32:56.839
What's it for?

32:57.776 --> 32:58.908
- Power.

33:01.279 --> 33:02.412
- Yeah?

33:02.547 --> 33:05.281
And that's your
altimeter right there.

33:08.320 --> 33:11.087
Important stuff
for an emergency landing.

33:11.223 --> 33:13.256
(ominous music)

33:26.171 --> 33:28.304
I've always been real good
with the mechanical stuff.

33:30.909 --> 33:33.110
Until my truck broke down
tonight.

33:34.713 --> 33:36.246
Well, I mean,
it wasn't my truck.

33:52.464 --> 33:53.797
I, uh...

33:55.467 --> 33:59.735
I worked as a farmhand
in dominica a few years back.

34:02.674 --> 34:03.973
Had to leave there, too.

34:06.011 --> 34:07.110
They'd...

34:08.947 --> 34:10.280
Farmers, they'd, uh...

34:11.784 --> 34:13.683
Spread garlic and onions

34:13.752 --> 34:16.085
All around the yard

34:16.121 --> 34:17.954
Trying to keep the snakes away.

34:20.158 --> 34:21.591
Every now and then,

34:23.929 --> 34:25.128
One of them got through.

34:30.035 --> 34:31.767
I'll never forget that sound.

34:33.839 --> 34:35.038
Middle of the night,

34:36.842 --> 34:39.309
The cows, they'd be out
in the field,

34:40.946 --> 34:45.182
And you'd just hear them,
just...

34:46.251 --> 34:47.416
Scream.

34:51.523 --> 34:53.590
These snakes, they'd, they'd...

34:53.592 --> 34:56.392
They'd wrap around their legs,

34:56.394 --> 34:58.194
They'd trap them so as
they couldn't move.

35:00.766 --> 35:02.098
And they just,

35:03.268 --> 35:06.235
Suck the milk
right from their udder.

35:10.275 --> 35:11.741
Suck 'em dry.

35:11.810 --> 35:14.277
(ominous music continues)

35:32.364 --> 35:34.497
(lexi exhales)

35:34.533 --> 35:36.499
(curious music)

35:41.039 --> 35:43.373
- Windy lake, poplar 209.

35:43.442 --> 35:46.042
I'm diverting
from prospect river.

35:46.178 --> 35:48.578
Eta to windy lake,
ten minutes.

35:48.580 --> 35:51.381
Require assistance
on the apron to unload.

35:52.984 --> 35:55.284
-<i> 209, windy lake.</i>

35:55.320 --> 35:57.186
<i> We don't have you</i>
<i> coming in tonight.</i>

35:57.222 --> 35:58.921
<i> There's no one here</i>
<i> to receive.</i>

35:58.957 --> 36:01.791
- Windy lake, 209 diverting
from planned route.

36:01.793 --> 36:03.660
Arriving imminently with...

36:03.795 --> 36:05.462
D.G.S on board.

36:05.597 --> 36:07.063
Require assistance to unload.

36:08.133 --> 36:10.866
-<i> 209, I don't see</i>
<i> dangerous goods</i>

36:10.903 --> 36:12.002
<i> On your manifest.</i>

36:12.137 --> 36:13.603
<i> Are you sure?</i>

36:15.674 --> 36:17.640
- Windy lake, it was unplanned.

36:20.278 --> 36:22.946
Uh, I picked up some canisters,

36:22.948 --> 36:25.415
Compressed gas at rocky narrows.

36:25.484 --> 36:27.751
Need assistance
on the apron on arrival.

36:27.753 --> 36:30.020
(tense music)

36:34.793 --> 36:37.160
(breathing heavily)

36:40.766 --> 36:42.565
- What the hell, lexi?

36:42.601 --> 36:43.967
You said you have
dangerous goods,

36:43.969 --> 36:45.501
But we weren't expecting you.

36:45.571 --> 36:46.970
- Okay.
- And there wasn't anything

36:46.972 --> 36:48.438
In your manifest.

36:48.573 --> 36:50.773
These things are supposed
to be planned...

36:50.809 --> 36:52.575
- This wasn't a part
of my plan either

36:52.578 --> 36:54.044
I had an unexpected passenger.

37:04.789 --> 37:06.589
(heavy breathing)

37:08.961 --> 37:11.227
(gentle music)

37:16.168 --> 37:19.168
(breathing heavily)
