Oh, Becky, I gotta help Louie.

[Rebecca] You're always helping Louie.
Why not me?

01:37.417 --> 01:39.834
[Baloo] 'Cause Louie asked nicely.

He gives me lots of
what you give me none of... respect.

01:47.542 --> 01:49.709

-To your castle, sir.

Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

Impossible, sir.
No sharks have been sighted

07:37.792 --> 07:40.041
Whatcha mean,
"Tsk, tsk, tsk"?

07:40.125 --> 07:46.667
Perhaps, baron, no one told you
about the Von Bruinwald family curse.

didn't agree with him.

Shocking, sir.

And then there was the sixth baron,

08:13.625 --> 08:15.959
he was taking his evening stroll
on the parapet,

08:16.041 --> 08:19.291

on a pad of butter, fell...

by choking on a cupcake.

09:19.792 --> 09:21.625

09:21.709 --> 09:23.417
I'm not crazy about devil's food anyway.

Will there be anything else, sir?

09:25.500 --> 09:28.625
No. I'll just take a little trip

On top of the stairs,
second right after the third left, sir.

12:59.083 --> 13:01.375
Thanks, and I mean it, bud.

13:05.041 --> 13:09.583
-[Rebecca] Well, what's for dinner?
-Baloodle strudel if I don't watch out.

13:09.667 --> 13:14.083
-This joint's full of booby traps.
-Booby is right.

13:19.166 --> 13:22.333
Uh, Rebecca, would you mind, um,
switching places with me?

13:22.417 --> 13:24.959
[groans]
OK.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.875
[yelling]

13:31.542 --> 13:33.291
[Hans]
Dinner is served.

13:35.709 --> 13:37.792
If it's a cake, call the fire department.

13:37.875 --> 13:41.583
Tonight, Helga has prepared
the baron's favorite.

13:41.667 --> 13:44.583
-What's that?
-Bavarian cupcakes!

13:45.291 --> 13:47.041
[yelling]

13:48.417 --> 13:51.709
Two right and three lefts.
Ta-dum.

13:51.792 --> 13:55.375
Or was it three...
three rights and two lefts? Ta-dum.

13:59.333 --> 14:03.125
Ha! Let's see a curse get through that.

14:06.375 --> 14:08.125
[yells]

14:11.917 --> 14:13.709
[footsteps approaching]

14:14.959 --> 14:18.917
[yelling]

14:22.125 --> 14:23.041
Now what?

14:23.333 --> 14:26.959
-Uh, can I stay here?
-No, you cannot stay here.

14:27.041 --> 14:30.208
But... it's spook central in my room.
Could we trade?

14:30.291 --> 14:35.709
-[yawning] Anything to get some sleep.
-Ah, thanks, Becky. You're a pal.

14:35.792 --> 14:37.542
[Rebecca yawning]

14:40.667 --> 14:44.875
[Wildcat] Third right and then a left.
Is that my left or the hallway's?

14:52.166 --> 14:54.083
Whew! Safe at last.

15:02.583 --> 15:04.625
Rebecca!
[yells]

15:04.709 --> 15:06.417
Help!

15:06.500 --> 15:09.917
[groans]
If that curse doesn't kill him, I will!

15:10.000 --> 15:12.208
Baloo, would you please...

15:12.750 --> 15:15.417
-[gasps]
-Help.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.291
[yells]

15:19.959 --> 15:23.000
Oh, Baloo, I'm sorry I didn't believe you.
You are cursed!

15:23.083 --> 15:28.083
Oh, Becky, if I get out alive,
I'm buying you a whole fleet of planes.

15:28.166 --> 15:29.166
Now, come on.

15:29.250 --> 15:32.208
Wait a minute.
Where's Wildcat?

15:32.291 --> 15:36.208
OK, the square root of two lefts
times three rights,

15:36.291 --> 15:40.000
and you put the decimal in, uh...
in the middle.

15:40.083 --> 15:41.500
Minus the first two lefts...

15:42.208 --> 15:45.917
Wildcat.
Wildcat!

15:52.917 --> 15:55.166
Psst.
Wildcat!

15:55.250 --> 15:59.000
[Hans] That dumb bear's stupider
than all his ancestors put together.

15:59.083 --> 16:03.709
[Helga] Patience, my wienerschnitzel,
we almost got him with the piano.

16:04.125 --> 16:07.208
[Hans] Father didn't have
this much trouble with the 12th baron.

16:07.291 --> 16:13.458
Aww, don't worry, my strudelipoo.
He's the last of the Bruinwald's.

16:13.542 --> 16:19.125
And when he's disposed of,
the castle is ours! [laughing]

16:19.208 --> 16:20.333
[gasps]

16:25.458 --> 16:26.959
[yelps]

16:27.041 --> 16:31.375
Well, I do so love it,
when guests drop in.

16:32.625 --> 16:35.959
[yelling]

16:41.458 --> 16:45.583
And we insist you stay for dinner!

16:45.667 --> 16:47.834
[laughing]

16:47.917 --> 16:50.750
Oh, I love this!

16:50.834 --> 16:54.083
[yells]

16:57.417 --> 16:59.041
[Rebecca yelling]

17:00.375 --> 17:01.458
Becky?

17:02.500 --> 17:05.625
[yelling continues]

17:05.709 --> 17:07.541
Becky!

17:09.583 --> 17:12.165
[Baloo yells]

17:14.250 --> 17:15.750
[grunts]

17:17.791 --> 17:19.250
[mumbles]

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
[Rebecca] Help!

17:52.291 --> 17:56.875
-You called, madam?
-Oh, Baloo, thank goodness.

17:57.500 --> 18:00.000
Thanks, Baloo.
You saved my neck.

18:00.208 --> 18:02.542
Let's bust those bums!

18:04.542 --> 18:06.959
-[Baloo] They escaped!
-But you won't!

18:07.041 --> 18:09.083
-Charge!
-Yoo-hoo!

18:09.166 --> 18:10.667
[both yelling]

18:20.208 --> 18:21.667
[yelling]

18:25.792 --> 18:28.834
[gasps] We're trapped.
Now what do we do?

18:28.917 --> 18:31.250
[Wildcat]
Three lefts and then right.

18:31.333 --> 18:34.250
If you get one, leaves one left, right?

18:35.291 --> 18:37.208
Uh, no, no, left.
OK, OK...

18:39.375 --> 18:42.834
They're not going anywhere,
my... [speaks German]

18:42.917 --> 18:46.500
We'll find them, and when we do...
[makes cutting sound]

18:46.583 --> 18:52.291
-Oh, I love it when you talk cutlery.
-[Helga] Ooh, Hansy! [giggles]

18:52.417 --> 18:56.709
You can't get good help these days.
They're fired!

18:56.792 --> 19:00.750
They won't quit till you're kaput.
They're after your castle!

19:00.917 --> 19:05.667
Hey, they can have the castle.
I just want to get out of here alive.

19:07.500 --> 19:08.959
I've got a plan.

19:09.041 --> 19:12.667
The only way to get you
out of here alive is to kill you.

19:13.208 --> 19:14.458
Bad plan.

19:14.750 --> 19:18.709
Trust me.
I've been waiting for this a long time.

19:23.834 --> 19:27.458
[Baloo] Oh, no!
I'm a goner!

19:27.542 --> 19:31.542
[grunts]
I think that sounded like the baron.

19:36.750 --> 19:40.333
I can't believe it!
He fell out the window.

19:40.333 --> 19:42.458
[Helga speaks German]

19:42.542 --> 19:45.625
The least he could have done
is let us push him.

19:46.458 --> 19:47.625
Who are you?

19:47.709 --> 19:50.750
Fritz Kadiddlehoffer, county undertaker.

19:50.834 --> 19:53.583
Undertaker?
You called the undertaker?

19:53.667 --> 19:55.083
I thought you did.

19:55.166 --> 19:58.583
Oh, who cares?
We needed him anyway.

19:58.667 --> 20:04.291
-Uh, is he... Could he be...
-I'm afraid so.

20:04.375 --> 20:08.959
-Are there any relatives?
-Uh, no. He's all yours!

20:09.041 --> 20:10.500
[chuckling]

20:12.917 --> 20:15.542
[all grunting]

20:15.625 --> 20:19.542
The Von Bruinwald's
always were tubs of lard.

20:19.625 --> 20:21.667
[Rebecca]
Guess it's all that fine cooking.

20:26.750 --> 20:31.083
[both cheering] The castle's ours!
The castle's ours!

20:31.166 --> 20:33.834
Oh, that tub of lard
can't call me a tub of lard!

20:33.917 --> 20:35.417
Doesn't she know who I am?

20:35.500 --> 20:37.667
[Featherich]
Baron Von Bruinwald?

20:37.750 --> 20:41.667
Hey, hey, just in time.
Arrest those two!

20:43.667 --> 20:46.917
-On what charge?
-Attempted murder!

20:48.041 --> 20:49.917
And bad cooking!

20:53.959 --> 20:55.875
[sighs]

20:55.959 --> 20:59.417
Becky, uh, thanks for saving my bacon.

20:59.500 --> 21:01.834
[clears throat]
And speaking of food,

21:01.917 --> 21:06.959
we're having fish eggs and franks
in the southwest drawing room.

21:07.041 --> 21:12.458
-Would milady care to join me?
-I'd love to.

21:12.542 --> 21:17.000
Not so fast. There is a curse
on the Von Bruinwald's--

21:17.083 --> 21:20.625
Three-hundred years
worth of back taxes.

21:20.709 --> 21:23.917
So? I'll write you a check.
Mere truffles.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.166
It's trifles.

21:25.250 --> 21:31.500
Hardly. The amount is 500 million
and one dollars and 89 cents.

21:31.583 --> 21:34.625
We're repossessing your entire estate.

21:34.709 --> 21:39.041
-[stuttering]
-Which is only worth 500 million.

21:39.125 --> 21:42.542
You owe a buck, 89.

21:42.625 --> 21:44.583
[groans]

21:47.041 --> 21:49.250
Your cheeseburger, sir.

21:49.333 --> 21:52.417
A French fry for milady?

21:53.375 --> 21:57.709
Becky, your cooking
beats that rich-folk food any day.

21:57.792 --> 22:00.625
[chuckles]
Thanks. But, you know,

22:00.709 --> 22:04.041
I have this nagging feeling
we forgot something.

22:04.959 --> 22:06.041
[both]
Oh, no!

22:06.125 --> 22:09.208
[Wildcat] Lean to the left.
Lean to the right.

22:09.291 --> 22:12.291
Stand up, sit down.
Yeah! Fight, fight, fight.

22:12.375 --> 22:13.375
Wait, I got it!
