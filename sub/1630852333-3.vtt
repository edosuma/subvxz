12:18.488 --> 12:20.365
Still stuck at work.
Where are you?

12:20.407 --> 12:22.534
- Where am I?
- [stammers]

12:22.575 --> 12:25.328
Make up something.
- I'm at the park.

12:25.370 --> 12:27.122
- You're in the park?
- No, no, no.

12:27.163 --> 12:28.748
- No, I'm not at the park.

12:28.790 --> 12:30.250
What made you say that?

12:30.291 --> 12:32.460
You must've misheard me.
I'll try to speak more clearly.

12:32.502 --> 12:35.839
Um, I'm on a ship.
- You're on a ship?

12:35.880 --> 12:37.007
- I'm certainly not in the car,

12:37.048 --> 12:38.049
if that's what
you're implying, mister.

12:38.091 --> 12:39.843
- Good, good.

12:39.884 --> 12:41.177
- Is everything okay?

12:41.219 --> 12:42.595
- He's asking
if everything's okay.

12:42.637 --> 12:45.890
- Oh, fuck, fuck.
Oh, what do we do here?

12:45.932 --> 12:47.851
What's our play?
What's our fucking play?

12:47.892 --> 12:49.769
- What do I say?
Do I say it's good?

12:49.811 --> 12:51.688
- Oh, got it, got it.

12:51.730 --> 12:55.358
Tell him everything's normal.
- Everything's normal.

12:55.400 --> 12:57.902
Um, I'm not at the park.
I'm on a ship.

12:57.944 --> 12:59.821
- Wow.
- Just a normal ship.

12:59.863 --> 13:01.364
Is everything normal
where you are?

13:01.406 --> 13:03.533
- Well, actually, things are
starting to heat up over here.

13:03.575 --> 13:07.328
Anyway, I wanted to apologize
again about tonight.

13:07.370 --> 13:09.539
Having a child with you is

13:09.581 --> 13:11.666
the most important thing
in the world to me, honey,

13:11.708 --> 13:14.627
and I just wanted to make sure
that you knew that.

13:14.669 --> 13:16.338
- Oh, okay. Bye.

13:19.549 --> 13:21.968
- Great job, Vicki.
That was the perfect call.

13:22.010 --> 13:23.094
Right, Piper?

13:24.888 --> 13:26.639
Whoo!

13:26.681 --> 13:29.601
[singer vocalizing]

13:32.562 --> 13:35.523
[tense music]

13:35.565 --> 13:39.194
* *

13:39.235 --> 13:41.237
- Sir.
- Yes, Major.

13:41.279 --> 13:43.198
- A C-130 was hijacked
over the Indian Ocean

13:43.239 --> 13:45.116
and dropped off radar.

13:45.158 --> 13:46.993
We think it's our guys.
- What were they carrying?

13:47.035 --> 13:48.328
- That's the thing,

13:48.370 --> 13:49.996
it was just a bunch
of ventilation equipment.

13:52.457 --> 13:54.668
- What the hell are they up to?

13:54.709 --> 13:56.920
- We managed to trace a call
from the cockpit

13:56.961 --> 13:58.672
to an encrypted
satellite phone.

13:58.713 --> 13:59.756
We're tracking that phone now.

13:59.798 --> 14:01.174
- Don't lose that signal,

14:01.216 --> 14:02.926
and get a Reaper
in the air pronto, Major.

14:02.967 --> 14:04.427
- Yes, sir.

14:07.681 --> 14:09.432
- Stay frosty, people.

14:11.017 --> 14:12.519
This is our only shot.

14:12.560 --> 14:15.480
[dramatic music]

14:15.522 --> 14:21.486
* *

14:29.536 --> 14:33.123
- What is this place?
- An abandoned weapons depot.

14:33.164 --> 14:35.291
It officially doesn't exist,

14:35.333 --> 14:37.836
but it does,
and you're about to see it.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.004
[clanging]

14:41.589 --> 14:42.674
This way.

14:42.716 --> 14:45.635
[suspenseful music]

14:45.677 --> 14:48.013
* *

14:48.054 --> 14:50.223
Haven't been in here
for 20 years.

14:50.265 --> 14:54.019
Fingers crossed,
nobody else has, either.

14:54.060 --> 14:55.186
Piper!

14:56.896 --> 14:57.856
Trip wire.

14:57.897 --> 15:02.277
* *

15:02.318 --> 15:04.529
That could've been very bad
for all of us.

15:04.571 --> 15:06.990
Now, watch your step
'cause I booby trapped

15:07.032 --> 15:09.325
this whole place
to the fucking gills.

15:09.367 --> 15:11.536
Now, let's keep moving.

15:11.578 --> 15:12.454
Carefully.

15:12.495 --> 15:14.330
- [groans]
Hey, guys.

15:14.372 --> 15:17.083
I think I got a problem.

15:17.125 --> 15:20.670
* *

15:20.712 --> 15:22.297
- Okay, look.

15:22.339 --> 15:24.924
Stay very still, Vicki.
- Okay.

15:24.966 --> 15:27.510
- I'm gonna get you
out of this.

15:27.552 --> 15:28.553
All right.

15:28.595 --> 15:30.096
Look, you've already
triggered it.

15:30.138 --> 15:31.473
- I know.

15:31.514 --> 15:34.684
- As long as we keep
pressure on it, like so,

15:34.726 --> 15:36.353
we'll be fine.

15:36.394 --> 15:38.438
It's all about physics.
- Mm-hmm.

15:38.480 --> 15:40.482
- Well, we can't
stay here forever, right?

15:40.523 --> 15:41.524
- Yeah.

15:41.566 --> 15:43.151
- So we're gonna
have to make a move.

15:43.193 --> 15:45.195
Okay, look. Vicki, look at me.

15:45.236 --> 15:46.529
Look at me!

15:46.571 --> 15:49.282
I need you to trust me.
Do you trust me?

15:49.324 --> 15:50.992
- Yes.
- Do you trust me?

15:51.034 --> 15:53.161
- I said yes.
- Good.

15:53.203 --> 15:54.704
'Cause I'm about
to spring this--

15:54.746 --> 15:55.789
- What?
- Right--

15:55.830 --> 15:56.956
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

15:56.998 --> 15:58.708
- Now!
- [screams]

16:04.547 --> 16:05.548
[sighs]

16:05.590 --> 16:08.718
- Like I said, watch your step.

16:08.760 --> 16:11.096
- [chuckles]

16:11.137 --> 16:13.848
Thank you for saving me.

16:13.890 --> 16:17.185
- It's what I do,
and it comes naturally,

16:17.227 --> 16:19.145
like breathing.
- Oh.

16:19.187 --> 16:21.523
- Just in and out.

16:21.564 --> 16:26.444
In, out, in, out.
- [moans]

16:26.486 --> 16:29.280
- In, out.
- [moans]

16:29.322 --> 16:33.868
- In and out. In and out.

16:33.910 --> 16:35.912
- Uh, could we keep moving?

16:35.954 --> 16:39.082
[sultry music]

16:39.124 --> 16:40.375
- Lady's choice.

16:41.918 --> 16:45.547
- Sure, well, I guess
we should keep moving.

16:45.588 --> 16:47.215
- Yeah.

16:47.257 --> 16:49.134
Here you go.
- [sighs]

16:49.175 --> 16:51.720
- There we go. All right.

17:17.162 --> 17:21.291

17:21.332 --> 17:24.502
- So MacGruber,
why are we here?

17:24.544 --> 17:27.756
- May 1, 1998, Burkina Faso.

17:27.797 --> 17:30.633
Tiger Company,
the most elite special ops unit

17:30.675 --> 17:32.510
in the world
had just gone rogue,

17:32.552 --> 17:35.388
and their leader, Brigadier
Commander Enos Queeth,

17:35.430 --> 17:37.766
had just gotten his hands
on the most devastating

17:37.807 --> 17:40.769
chemical weapon the world
has ever known--

17:40.810 --> 17:42.228
Brimstone.

17:42.270 --> 17:45.315

Six, nine, six, nine,

six, nine, number sign.

17:51.029 --> 17:52.280
[keypad beeps]

17:53.865 --> 17:57.202
But what Queeth didn't know is
that Tiger Company had a mole.

17:57.243 --> 18:00.455
Well, a mole-Gruber.

18:00.497 --> 18:03.124
Long story short,
I stole Brimstone

18:03.166 --> 18:04.542
and left Queeth
and his men to die

18:04.584 --> 18:06.503
in a Burkina Fasonian prison.

18:06.544 --> 18:09.673
Only problem, they didn't die.

18:09.714 --> 18:13.176
And now Queeth will do anything
to get his hands on this stuff,

18:13.218 --> 18:14.678
but luckily for us,

18:14.719 --> 18:18.181
I hid it where Queeth will
never find it.

18:18.223 --> 18:21.601
Right through this door.

18:21.643 --> 18:24.062

18:26.898 --> 18:33.279

18:33.321 --> 18:34.739
- Why didn't you
just destroy it?

18:34.781 --> 18:38.076
- Piper, someone worked
very hard on this.

18:38.118 --> 18:41.454
And now the moment
we've all been waiting for.

18:41.496 --> 18:45.250
Did Queeth beat us to it,
or did we beat Queeth?

18:47.460 --> 18:52.173
Six, nine, six, nine,
six, nine, six, nine.

18:52.215 --> 18:53.383

- What do you mean liar?
- Oh, just a detail.

19:28.793 --> 19:30.879
Queeth lied to me,
said he already had this thing.

19:30.920 --> 19:33.757
- But why would he lie to you
about having it?

19:33.798 --> 19:35.842
- I don't know,
some people just like to lie.

19:35.884 --> 19:37.260
You know,
it makes them feel like

19:37.302 --> 19:38.803
they can hang
with the big boys,

19:38.845 --> 19:42.932
but sadly, Queeth is munching
our farts on this one.

19:42.974 --> 19:44.893
Fucking dumbass.

19:44.934 --> 19:48.438
I mean, this is such a great
series of wins for me.

19:48.480 --> 19:50.065
He fucking lies to me
about having it,

19:50.106 --> 19:52.484
and I know he's lying,
that's win number one.

19:52.525 --> 19:54.402
Then I escape
like a fucking badass,

19:54.444 --> 19:55.695
that's win number two.

19:55.737 --> 19:57.655
And now I have the thing
he desperately needs.

19:57.697 --> 19:59.699
I don't know if
you're counting, but I am,

19:59.741 --> 20:01.034
and that's win number two.

20:02.744 --> 20:06.122
- So he lied to you and said
he already had Brimstone.

20:06.164 --> 20:07.457
- Yes.

20:07.499 --> 20:10.335
- And then you somehow escaped.

20:10.377 --> 20:13.088
- Heroically
and against all odds, yes.

20:13.129 --> 20:14.631
- Yeah, they let you go.

20:14.673 --> 20:16.007
- Practically, right?

20:16.049 --> 20:18.551
- No, I mean,
they let you out on purpose.

20:18.593 --> 20:22.347
- What? Ha.
I assure you, they did not.

20:25.058 --> 20:26.518
- Why don't you tell us
a little more

20:26.559 --> 20:28.103
about this crazy escape
of yours?

20:28.144 --> 20:30.271
- I'd fucking love
to take you through it.

20:30.313 --> 20:33.358
Yes, so there I am at
this freaky underground lair,

20:33.400 --> 20:35.694
naked, hanging schlong
for all to see.

20:35.735 --> 20:37.529
And I didn't
even fucking care, right?

20:37.570 --> 20:38.947
I sense an opening,

20:38.988 --> 20:41.199
and I just fucking rip out
of my restraints

20:41.241 --> 20:43.952
and fight my way through
the guy who was watching me.

20:43.993 --> 20:45.995
- Wait, they left you
with just one guy?

20:46.037 --> 20:48.581
- Yeah, but he was, like,
a super fucking badass.

20:48.623 --> 20:50.959
Like, one of the toughest
blind guys you'll ever see.

20:51.001 --> 20:53.712
- Sorry, they left you
with a blind guy?

20:53.753 --> 20:55.797
- Oh, yeah, and it was
so fucking terrifying.

20:55.839 --> 20:57.465
You point that guy
in the right direction,

20:57.507 --> 20:58.967
he's like a guided missile.

20:59.009 --> 21:02.012
Oh, Constantine Bach.
You guys know him. Remember?

21:02.053 --> 21:04.597
Yeah, apparently, he didn't die
in that explosion.

21:04.639 --> 21:06.850
Anyway, so there was
this scalpel on a tray

21:06.891 --> 21:09.060
that was right next to me,
and when the blind guy,

21:09.102 --> 21:11.479
Constantine,
turned away for a sec--

21:11.521 --> 21:13.648
stupid fucking move, right?

21:13.690 --> 21:16.526
It gave me more than enough
time to free myself.

21:16.568 --> 21:18.987
And then I just hand to hand
combatted him,

21:19.029 --> 21:20.905
burned him alive
with his own flamethrower,

21:20.947 --> 21:23.199
skinned him--it was
my first time doing that--

21:23.241 --> 21:24.451
and then escaped.

21:24.492 --> 21:26.536
So you still think
they let me out?

21:26.578 --> 21:29.372
- 100%.
- I think maybe they did.

21:29.414 --> 21:31.416
- [laughs]
Yeah, that makes sense.

21:31.458 --> 21:34.210
They let me out so I could
immediately race right here

21:34.252 --> 21:36.880
and stop them from getting
the one thing they wanted?

21:36.921 --> 21:39.215
- Yeah, they didn't know
where it was.

21:39.257 --> 21:40.383
You led them right to it.

21:40.425 --> 21:42.010
- Oh, my God, Piper.

21:42.052 --> 21:44.971
We are so embarrassed for you.
- [mouthing words]

21:45.013 --> 21:47.057
- You have so much fucking egg
on your face.

21:47.098 --> 21:50.226
I mean, do you hear yourself
when you talk?

21:50.268 --> 21:53.229
If I had led them right to it
then they would be here by--

21:53.271 --> 21:56.566
[door clangs open]
Whoa, whoa, there they are.

21:56.608 --> 21:58.401
- MacGruber.

21:58.443 --> 21:59.903
- Hello, Queeth.

21:59.944 --> 22:03.865
- Thanks for leading us
to your little hiding place.

22:03.907 --> 22:05.575
- So this was all a set up?

22:05.617 --> 22:07.410
- You really catch on quick.

22:07.452 --> 22:10.330
* *

22:10.372 --> 22:13.333
- And you catch on
slow and low.

22:13.375 --> 22:15.669
You're such a dumb
piece of shit.

22:15.710 --> 22:18.254
See, I knew that
was your plan all along,

22:18.296 --> 22:22.425
so I made the very smart
decision to counterplan you.

22:22.467 --> 22:23.635
Net drop!

22:29.349 --> 22:31.768
So where were we?

22:31.810 --> 22:34.604
- It was something
about a counterplan.

22:34.646 --> 22:37.774
- Ah, yes, the counterplan.

22:37.816 --> 22:39.984
I mean, do you honestly believe

22:40.026 --> 22:42.362
that I would lead you
right to Brimstone?

22:42.404 --> 22:43.613
Well then, think again.

22:43.655 --> 22:45.990
Then think again
and then think again

22:46.032 --> 22:49.285
and again and again and again,
'cause that ain't this

22:49.327 --> 22:51.287
and this ain't that.

22:51.329 --> 22:52.789
- Then you'll let me have it.

22:52.831 --> 22:57.168
- [chuckles]
Go ahead, take it. Here.

22:57.210 --> 22:58.670
Be my guest.

23:00.338 --> 23:01.715
- Why did you do that?

23:04.759 --> 23:07.387
- I'm telling you,
you're getting played.

23:07.429 --> 23:08.596
Right, guys?

23:08.638 --> 23:10.974
- [chuckles]
Yes.

23:11.016 --> 23:13.643
- That's right--
not only is that canister

23:13.685 --> 23:15.687
filled with
a bunch of fresh jizz

23:15.729 --> 23:17.522
from me and Piper here--
right, Piper?

23:17.564 --> 23:19.733
Right, Piper?
- Yeah.

23:19.774 --> 23:22.027
- But as we speak,
you are surrounded

23:22.068 --> 23:25.155
by the full width and breadth
of the U.S. military,

23:25.196 --> 23:28.616
who have orders to shoot you
on my command.

23:28.658 --> 23:31.327
Hold off there, General,
for a second.

23:31.369 --> 23:34.456
Think I might be able to talk
a little sense into him.

23:34.497 --> 23:35.915
Oh, 10-4, what's that?

23:35.957 --> 23:39.085
Huh? Roger? Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

23:39.127 --> 23:41.838
[laughs]

23:41.880 --> 23:44.799
Oh, they want to shoot
your fucking face off so bad,

23:44.841 --> 23:48.762
but I won't let them yet.

23:48.803 --> 23:51.723
So you want to rethink
your dumb little plan?

23:51.765 --> 23:52.974
Hang on, hang on.

23:53.016 --> 23:55.852
Yeah, he's thinking about it

23:55.894 --> 23:59.272
with his dumb little brain.

23:59.314 --> 24:01.691
So don't kill him yet.

24:01.733 --> 24:03.276
Give him another ten...

24:03.318 --> 24:05.195
[tense music]

24:05.236 --> 24:06.738
Nine...

24:08.114 --> 24:09.115
Eight...

24:10.492 --> 24:12.243
- Seven.
- S--seven.

24:12.285 --> 24:15.121
* *

24:15.163 --> 24:16.790
- Six.
- Six.

24:16.831 --> 24:18.541
- Five.
- Fi--

24:18.583 --> 24:19.959
- Four.

24:20.001 --> 24:22.212
- Four...

24:22.253 --> 24:23.380
- Three.

24:23.421 --> 24:28.343
- Three...

24:28.385 --> 24:29.386
- Two.

24:29.427 --> 24:36.601
- Two...

24:43.441 --> 24:44.609
- One.

24:49.155 --> 24:53.576
* *

24:53.618 --> 24:55.537
- One more,
straight down the barrel.

24:55.578 --> 24:56.788
- Yes, sir.

25:01.209 --> 25:02.293
- Come on! This way.

25:04.129 --> 25:06.506
- Sir, it was a drone.
It's coming around again.

25:06.548 --> 25:08.049
- Yeah, well, take it out.

25:09.467 --> 25:10.635
Now!

25:13.763 --> 25:16.182
[computer beeping]

25:16.224 --> 25:17.434
[phone chimes]

25:17.475 --> 25:24.649
* *

25:31.156 --> 25:32.240
- Good God.

25:32.282 --> 25:38.788
* *

25:38.830 --> 25:40.206
Abort! Abort!

25:40.248 --> 25:41.624
- Sorry, sir,
it's been deployed.

25:41.666 --> 25:43.460
- Redirect. Redirect!

25:43.501 --> 25:44.794
- Trying, sir.

25:47.047 --> 25:49.341
- [laughs]
Swing and a miss.

25:51.718 --> 25:53.178
Fire.

25:53.219 --> 25:55.096
[computer beeping]

25:55.138 --> 25:56.681
- Got them.

26:02.354 --> 26:04.981
- Uplink terminated.
- Damn it!

26:05.023 --> 26:06.983
Get another Reaper up now.

26:07.025 --> 26:08.860
- 20 minutes, sir.
- Now, major!

26:08.902 --> 26:10.278
- Yes, sir.

26:10.320 --> 26:12.822
- Now, where's our friend,
MacGruber?

26:12.864 --> 26:14.574
[tires squealing]

26:14.616 --> 26:16.034
[gunfire]

26:16.076 --> 26:18.703
- Ha, ha! Fuck you, Queeth.

26:21.873 --> 26:23.249
- Want us to go after him, sir?

26:23.291 --> 26:26.920
- No, we got
a schedule to keep.

26:28.630 --> 26:30.507
We got what we came for.

26:30.548 --> 26:32.967
* *

26:36.971 --> 26:39.933
[dramatic music]

26:39.974 --> 26:47.107
