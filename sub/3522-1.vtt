07:25.878 --> 07:28.381

You look good.

07:56.409 --> 07:58.411
Tan.

07:58.411 --> 07:59.912
Yeah, right.

08:00.413 --> 08:01.914
The tan ghost.

08:01.914 --> 08:04.917
You're a good guy, tony,
but you abuse that joke shit.

08:05.418 --> 08:06.919
What do you go
t to say to me?

08:06.919 --> 08:08.921
I'm back, tony,
i'm tan.

08:08.921 --> 08:11.924
I'm in a fucking
tan nightmare

08:11.924 --> 08:13.926
what do you think,
i'm stupid?

08:13.926 --> 08:15.428
I don't know it,

08:15.428 --> 08:16.929
when every fuckin'
one of my friends

08:17.430 --> 08:18.931
turns their hearts to
stone against me, fuck!

08:19.432 --> 08:20.933
Easy, okay.

08:21.434 --> 08:23.936
I don't think
you're stupid.

08:23.936 --> 08:25.938
There was a fuckin' rat.

08:25.938 --> 08:27.940
So, you finger me?

08:27.940 --> 08:30.443
You think i didn't realize
what was going on

08:30.443 --> 08:32.945
when you come to my house,
three o'clock in the afternoon,

08:32.945 --> 08:35.448
telling me
you're my friend.

08:35.448 --> 08:37.450
That's when i knew
i was in trouble, anthony.

08:37.950 --> 08:38.951
When outta the blue,
you come,

08:38.951 --> 08:39.952
and for no reason,

08:40.453 --> 08:41.453
you start telling me
you're my friend.

08:41.453 --> 08:42.955
Oh, is that right?

08:42.955 --> 08:44.957
Anthony jr. , get up!

08:51.464 --> 08:53.466
You owe me the
fuckin' explanation,

08:53.466 --> 08:54.967
and you know what
i'm talking about.

08:54.967 --> 08:57.470
Well, remind me, tony,
never to get sick again, huh?

08:57.470 --> 09:00.473
Remind me, please, never
to have a serious illness,

09:00.473 --> 09:02.475
because, with you,
and silvio, and paulie,

09:02.975 --> 09:03.976
and all you pricks,

09:03.976 --> 09:05.978
weakness could spread
as fuckin' treason!

09:05.978 --> 09:07.480
You know what?
Fuck you!

09:07.480 --> 09:08.981
I don't wanna hear about
your fucking back anymore!

09:09.482 --> 09:10.483
Who's your
fucking boss, huh?

09:10.983 --> 09:12.485
Who's your
fucking boss?

09:12.485 --> 09:13.986
Who gets the
explanation?

09:13.986 --> 09:15.488
What, am i
supposed to trust you?

09:15.488 --> 09:19.992
You- fuckin'- off- the
reservation- cocksucker!

09:19.992 --> 09:22.995
It was a broad, tony,
it was complicated.

09:22.995 --> 09:24.997
My back was for shit,
you knew that.

09:24.997 --> 09:27.500
I don't wanna fuckin' hear
anymore about your back!

09:27.500 --> 09:29.001
That's how we met.

09:29.001 --> 09:33.506
That's why i was
popping percosets
like freaking jujubes!

09:33.506 --> 09:38.511
Anyway, my doctor,
he prescribes this
clinic for me,

09:38.511 --> 09:40.012
in puerto rico.

09:40.012 --> 09:42.014
I didn't exactly
object, tony,

09:42.014 --> 09:44.517
given the fuckin'
vibes around here.

09:44.517 --> 09:46.018
Go ahead, check.

09:46.018 --> 09:48.020
You don't tell your wife
you're in the hospital?

09:48.020 --> 09:49.522
That twat brought on
most of this.

09:49.522 --> 09:50.523
How?

09:51.023 --> 09:52.525
Listen, down there,
i met this girl.

09:52.525 --> 09:56.028
26, an acupuncturist.

09:56.028 --> 09:58.531
It was the only thing
that fuckin' really helped

09:58.531 --> 10:00.032
with my sciatic nerve.

10:00.032 --> 10:01.534
Anyway, one thing
lead to another.

10:01.534 --> 10:03.536
You can't send
one feeler to me?

10:03.536 --> 10:06.038
I'm gonna trust
you, paulie?

10:06.038 --> 10:08.040
Take the word
of a degenerate
cop over me?

10:08.541 --> 10:14.046
Tony, who are you
talking to down there?

10:14.046 --> 10:17.550
Jesus!

10:17.550 --> 10:19.552
So, why'd you
come back, huh?

10:19.552 --> 10:22.054
What changed?

10:22.054 --> 10:25.558
Nothing changed,
that's the problem.

10:25.558 --> 10:28.060
I still got two kids
in college, tony.

10:28.060 --> 10:31.063
One just got married,
needs my help.

10:31.063 --> 10:33.065
I gotta start
earnin' again.

10:33.065 --> 10:34.567
I gotta get
my action back.

10:34.567 --> 10:35.568
Oh, just like that?

10:36.068 --> 10:39.572
I came to you, tony,
i'm in your hands.

10:39.572 --> 10:43.075
Bring up two cases
of bottled water with you!

10:49.582 --> 10:51.584
Come here.

10:52.084 --> 10:53.586
Come here,
you fat fuck.

11:01.594 --> 11:03.596
Hey, my back, hey.

11:03.596 --> 11:08.601
I still gotta get
these freaking shots.

11:09.101 --> 11:11.103
You fuckin'
beached whale.

11:11.103 --> 11:16.609
Hey, you wanna
pat this down, too?

11:17.109 --> 11:19.612
Come here.

11:19.612 --> 11:22.114
Come on.

11:28.621 --> 11:31.624
Don't you ever pull
shit like this again.

11:37.630 --> 11:39.632
So your uncle's
under indictment?

11:40.132 --> 11:42.134
12 rico predicates.

11:42.134 --> 11:44.136
Who stepped up
to run his crew?

11:44.637 --> 11:46.639
His piss boy,
philly parisi.

11:47.139 --> 11:49.141
Oh, yeah, philly.

11:49.141 --> 11:53.145
Philly, don't
forget the pastries!

12:08.160 --> 12:11.163
That's my favorite bag,
don't lose it.

12:38.691 --> 12:40.192
Yo, philly.

12:50.202 --> 12:51.203
Were you
waiting long?

12:51.203 --> 12:52.705
Not bad.

12:52.705 --> 12:54.206
We were late
landing, anyhow.

12:54.206 --> 12:55.708
Hey, thanks for
doing this, philly.

12:55.708 --> 12:58.210
Coming off the lam
, every nickel counts.

12:58.210 --> 13:01.714
These fuckin' cabs.

13:02.214 --> 13:04.216
So how's boston?

13:04.216 --> 13:06.218
Well, it was good
to be back for a while,

13:06.218 --> 13:07.219
then, you know.

13:07.720 --> 13:09.221
Do i?

13:09.221 --> 13:12.224
That place
is scranton,
with clams.

13:12.224 --> 13:15.728
So, what's been
going on?

13:15.728 --> 13:18.230
Same tale of woe.

13:18.230 --> 13:22.234
What the hell do i hear about
tony soprano and his mother?

13:22.735 --> 13:26.739
Some kind of accident?

13:26.739 --> 13:28.741
He had her in a
nursing home,
you know?

13:28.741 --> 13:29.742
Get the fuck
out of here.

13:29.742 --> 13:31.243
And this, upse
t junior, no end.

13:31.243 --> 13:32.745
And when junio
r come after him,

13:32.745 --> 13:34.246
tony went to the home,

13:34.246 --> 13:36.749
and tried to suffocate
his own mother.

13:37.249 --> 13:38.751
Maybe you shouldn't
spread that rumor.

13:38.751 --> 13:40.252
That's some ugly shit.

13:40.252 --> 13:41.754
I'm only telling you.

13:41.754 --> 13:45.257
Listen, you'd be
fuckin' amazed.

13:45.257 --> 13:46.759
There's more?

13:46.759 --> 13:48.260
Ehh...

13:48.761 --> 13:52.264
no, what?

13:52.765 --> 13:54.767
He was seeing
a psychiatrist.

13:54.767 --> 13:56.268
Tony?

13:56.268 --> 13:58.771
Fuckin' broad
from montclair.

13:58.771 --> 14:07.279
Anyway, this,
is who leads us now.

14:07.279 --> 14:08.781
There you go, kid.

14:08.781 --> 14:11.283
There you go,
you big mouth fuck!

14:40.813 --> 14:42.314
It's done.

14:50.823 --> 14:53.325
Maybe she's
seeing someone.

14:53.325 --> 14:57.329
You know,
the way i see you.

14:57.329 --> 15:04.837
If she were,
she'd never tell me.

15:05.337 --> 15:11.844
I'm afraid we'll
have to stop now.

15:12.344 --> 15:14.847
When's your office
going to be finished?

15:14.847 --> 15:17.349
Oh, my new carpet's
not in yet.

15:17.850 --> 15:20.352
I'm sorry, i know
this is awkward.

15:20.853 --> 15:23.856
My old therapist used
to work out of his home.

15:23.856 --> 15:27.359
That's not
convenient for me.

15:39.371 --> 15:40.372
Yes?

15:40.873 --> 15:42.374
It's all over, it'
s safe to go home now.

15:42.875 --> 15:44.376
How did you get
this phone number?

15:44.376 --> 15:46.378
Where are you
calling me from?

15:46.378 --> 15:49.381
Are you watching me?

15:54.887 --> 15:56.889
You know, from
what you told me,

15:57.389 --> 15:59.391
webistics would be perfect
for your portfolio.

15:59.391 --> 16:01.894
I understand you're
on a fixed income,

16:02.394 --> 16:03.395
but, with webistics,

16:03.395 --> 16:04.897
you could triple
your money in a year.

16:05.397 --> 16:09.401
Uh- huh, yeah,
10, 12 months.

16:15.908 --> 16:17.910
What time is it?

16:18.410 --> 16:22.414
So,"e. F.",
i'm listening.

16:22.414 --> 16:24.917
It's fuckin'
tedious, this shit.

16:24.917 --> 16:26.919
Well, you
are the boss.

16:26.919 --> 16:29.421
And if it's your
executive decision

16:29.922 --> 16:30.923
to go down the shore,

16:30.923 --> 16:32.925
fuck it.

16:32.925 --> 16:34.927
Yeah.

16:42.935 --> 16:43.936
Yo, matthew.

16:43.936 --> 16:46.438
I gotta take
a meeting...

16:46.939 --> 16:48.440
keep things
in control here.

16:48.440 --> 16:53.946
Word up,
later chief.

16:53.946 --> 16:54.947
I really shouldn't
be telling you this.

16:54.947 --> 16:55.948
The company's
webistics.

16:56.448 --> 16:57.950
It's the next
yahoo right now.

16:57.950 --> 16:58.951
We're really
only selling it

16:59.451 --> 17:00.953
to prefrred clients.

17:00.953 --> 17:03.455
Yeah, american forestry,
19 and 1/2, up 3/8s,

17:03.455 --> 17:04.957
a very
sound company.

17:04.957 --> 17:07.459
Uh- huh.

17:16.468 --> 17:19.471
Well, it depends o
n whether you wanna go

17:19.471 --> 17:20.973
for growth or value.

17:20.973 --> 17:22.473
We got hundred
s of mutual funds

17:22.974 --> 17:24.476
you can
choose from.

17:24.476 --> 17:25.978
Ahh!

17:26.478 --> 17:29.481
You're supposed
to push webistics!

17:29.481 --> 17:31.483
I was giving
them alternatives.

17:31.483 --> 17:33.986
Webistics is our
pick of the week.

17:33.986 --> 17:37.990
Why, it's got a three
million float,

17:37.990 --> 17:41.493
and their technology's
two years behind.

17:41.493 --> 17:42.494
Your stock's a dog.

17:42.494 --> 17:43.996
Ahh!

17:52.504 --> 17:54.506
Hey, stop that!

17:54.506 --> 17:57.509
Hey, i'm still
the manager here,
this is unacceptable.

17:57.509 --> 17:59.011
Where's moltisanti?

17:59.011 --> 18:01.013
I'm gonna make a call
if you don't think i know

18:01.013 --> 18:02.014
who really
runs this operation.

18:02.014 --> 18:07.519
Get back in your
fuckin' office.

18:08.020 --> 18:11.023
Anybody else got a problem
with webistics?

18:21.533 --> 18:22.534
Tony...

18:22.534 --> 18:24.036
hey, counselor,
how are you?

18:24.036 --> 18:26.038
How are you?

18:26.538 --> 18:27.039
Good.

18:27.539 --> 18:28.540
You look
good, huh?

18:28.540 --> 18:33.045
Have a seat.

18:33.045 --> 18:34.546
You want a drink?

18:34.546 --> 18:35.547
No.

18:35.547 --> 18:36.548
Before we commence,

18:37.049 --> 18:38.550
a thousand thank yous
for webistics.

18:38.550 --> 18:41.053
I sold off some of
my disney to buy it.

18:41.053 --> 18:42.554
My pleasure.

18:42.554 --> 18:45.557
So, where do we
stand this month?

18:45.557 --> 18:48.560
Your uncle's petitioning
to get out of jail

18:48.560 --> 18:50.062
on a medical
pending trial.

18:50.062 --> 18:52.064
Let him.

18:52.064 --> 18:54.566
Neil thinks they're
liable to let him out.

18:54.566 --> 18:57.569
Maybe as a temptation
for you to act, again.

18:57.569 --> 18:59.071
Since you are
at the helm,

18:59.071 --> 19:01.073
it all gets back to
putting up bigger blinds.

19:01.073 --> 19:05.077
Really limiting your exposure
to potential rico boo- boos.

19:05.077 --> 19:06.578
The only way to run
a family these days

19:06.578 --> 19:08.080
is bunker style.

19:08.080 --> 19:09.581
You peer out
through the slit.

19:11.083 --> 19:12.584
Excuse me.

19:12.584 --> 19:13.585
Yeah.

19:13.585 --> 19:15.087
You're not gonna
believe this.

19:15.087 --> 19:16.088
Your sister's here.

19:16.088 --> 19:17.589
Barbara?

19:17.589 --> 19:19.091
Nope, janice.

19:19.091 --> 19:20.092
You're shitting me.

19:20.092 --> 19:21.093
Nope.

19:21.593 --> 19:23.095
I wonder what
the scam is this time.

19:23.095 --> 19:24.596
Whatever it is, i'm gonna
be five grand lighter

19:25.097 --> 19:30.102
before she raindances
back to the commune.

19:30.102 --> 19:32.604
Alright, tell her she can
stay with us if she wants.

19:32.604 --> 19:33.605
Are you sure?

19:33.605 --> 19:36.108
Yeah.

19:36.108 --> 19:37.609
We'll get barbara
and tom and the kids,

19:37.609 --> 19:40.112
and we'll make
a family reunion out of it.

19:40.612 --> 19:42.114
But obviously...

19:42.114 --> 19:44.116
your mother
isn't welcome.

19:44.116 --> 19:46.618
Give janice my love.

19:46.618 --> 19:53.125
See you later.

19:53.125 --> 19:55.127
My sister's here
from seattle.

19:55.127 --> 19:56.128
Nice.

20:01.633 --> 20:03.135
Where is he?

20:03.635 --> 20:05.137
Let me pinch those
bulldog cheeks.

20:05.637 --> 20:08.140
Come over here.

20:08.140 --> 20:09.141
Puerto rico?

20:09.141 --> 20:10.142
Yeah.

20:10.642 --> 20:11.643
That water
down there...

20:12.144 --> 20:13.645
you think you woulda
shit some of this
weight off!

20:13.645 --> 20:15.647
Did you tell him
we were about to

20:15.647 --> 20:18.150
start crabbin'
the hackensack river
looking for him?

20:18.650 --> 20:19.651
What the fuck's
the matter with you?

20:19.651 --> 20:20.652
Tony explained it.

20:20.652 --> 20:22.654
Listen to this.

20:22.654 --> 20:24.656
You heard abou
t jimmy altieri?

20:24.656 --> 20:26.658
Yeah, flipped,
fuckin' asshole.

20:26.658 --> 20:28.660
He had two assholes
when they buried him.

20:29.161 --> 20:30.662
So, all my money that
was on the street,

20:31.163 --> 20:35.167
all those payments,
i guess, just evaporated.

20:35.167 --> 20:36.168
We made your
pick- ups,

20:36.668 --> 20:37.669
they're ready and
waiting for you.

20:38.170 --> 20:39.171
Thanks, paulie.

20:39.171 --> 20:42.174
I mean that,
no shit.

20:42.174 --> 20:44.676
All those pricks
paid up to the letter?

20:44.676 --> 20:46.678
A few things got
lost in the confusion.

20:46.678 --> 20:49.181
I'm sure you could
picture.

20:49.181 --> 20:51.683
We did the best we could
with the information we had.

20:51.683 --> 20:57.189
The boss of the family
deserves the credit
right here.

21:00.692 --> 21:01.193
Salut.

21:01.693 --> 21:04.196
Salut.
Salut. Salut.

21:04.196 --> 21:05.697
Hey, sil?

21:05.697 --> 21:06.198
What?

21:06.698 --> 21:07.699
"What."

21:07.699 --> 21:12.204
I've been gone a long time,
let me hear it.

21:12.704 --> 21:14.206
"Just when they
thought i was out,

21:14.706 --> 21:17.709
"they pull me
back in.

21:17.709 --> 21:21.713
"Alright, just
this one time.

21:21.713 --> 21:24.216
I'll let you ask m
e about my affairs."

21:24.216 --> 21:31.723
"Is it true, michael?"

21:31.723 --> 21:33.725
"No."

21:33.725 --> 21:38.730
"You fuck!"

21:38.730 --> 21:40.732
"Our true enemy,

21:41.233 --> 21:43.735
has yet to
reveal himself."

21:43.735 --> 21:46.238
He's on a roll!

21:46.738 --> 21:51.743
I gotta get
the fuck out of here.

21:52.244 --> 21:54.746
Oh, tony, i hate
to ruin the party.

21:54.746 --> 21:58.250
I got a call from
loiaco down at
brokerage.

21:58.250 --> 22:00.752
Fuckin' chip and dale
sent one the brokers

22:00.752 --> 22:02.754
to the
emergency room.

22:02.754 --> 22:05.757
Oh, fuck me,
these kids!

22:05.757 --> 22:08.760
My fuckin'
nephew, right?

22:09.261 --> 22:11.763
You call him,
and you tell him

22:11.763 --> 22:13.765
i wanna see him
right away.

22:24.776 --> 22:26.278
It all checks out.

22:26.278 --> 22:28.780
Puerto rico,
the clinic.

22:28.780 --> 22:30.782
All that shit from
what i can tell.

22:43.795 --> 22:45.797
How was the guest bed,
did you sleep alright?

22:45.797 --> 22:46.798
Great.

22:46.798 --> 22:48.800
Except, usually
i bring my own pillow,

22:48.800 --> 22:50.302
ergonomic,

22:50.302 --> 22:52.804
it got ripped off at
the bus stop in rapid city.

22:52.804 --> 22:55.807
Linoleum's not good enough
for you to sleep on no more?

22:55.807 --> 22:59.311
Look who decides to join us,
my little brother.

22:59.311 --> 23:00.812
How you doing, jan?

23:00.812 --> 23:02.814
Parvati.

23:02.814 --> 23:04.816
I'm her brother,
i get a pass.

23:04.816 --> 23:07.319
You look good,
you look...

23:07.319 --> 23:08.820
like a teenager.

23:08.820 --> 23:10.822
My therapist says
i'm regressing.

23:11.323 --> 23:13.325
Oh, your therapist,
who pays for that?

23:13.325 --> 23:14.826
The state of
washington.

23:14.826 --> 23:16.328
Total disability.

23:16.328 --> 23:17.829
Oh, yeah,
the epstein- barr.

23:18.330 --> 23:20.332
Was. Chronic carpel tunnel
from my last job,

23:20.332 --> 23:25.837
the steam milk machine.
No worse pain.

23:25.837 --> 23:27.339
Hey, i stayed up
waiting for you,

23:27.339 --> 23:28.840
when'd you get in?

23:28.840 --> 23:32.344
Late, morning.

23:32.344 --> 23:35.347
What the fuck
is that smell?

23:35.347 --> 23:37.349
Miso soup,
it's seaweed.

23:37.349 --> 23:39.351
She's been telling us
all about seattle.

23:39.351 --> 23:40.852
If i see those
grunge pants on you,

23:40.852 --> 23:42.354
you'll be on the
ground looking up.

23:42.354 --> 23:43.855
Dad, how do you
stay so hip?

23:43.855 --> 23:45.357
I'll be back in a sec.

23:45.357 --> 23:46.858
And don't let your
father near my soup.

23:46.858 --> 23:48.360
He makes fun,
but before noon,

23:48.360 --> 23:54.866
he'll eat anything
that's not locked away.

23:54.866 --> 23:56.368
You don't see your
sister for years,

23:56.368 --> 23:58.370
right away you start
in on her diet?

23:58.370 --> 24:01.373
Hey, believe me, she gives
as good as she gets.

24:06.878 --> 24:11.383
Give me a hit
off that.

24:11.383 --> 24:17.389
Oh, who's in
charge here?

24:17.389 --> 24:19.391
You look sensational,
janice, really.

24:19.391 --> 24:21.393
Not a line.

24:21.893 --> 24:23.395
Two beautiful kids
, you must be proud.

24:23.395 --> 24:25.397
Yeah, yeah,
how'bout that, huh?

24:25.397 --> 24:31.903
Even with
our genes.

24:31.903 --> 24:34.406
So, you still
with that, uh, adolph?

24:34.406 --> 24:35.907
Rolf.

24:35.907 --> 24:37.909
No.

24:37.909 --> 24:42.914
Rolf went back
to andorra.

24:42.914 --> 24:44.916
You seem good,
mood- wise.

24:44.916 --> 24:46.918
Yeah, things are
very good nowadays.

24:46.918 --> 24:49.921
So, how are things
really, with ma?

24:49.921 --> 24:55.927
She's dead to me.

24:56.428 --> 24:57.929
I don't wanna get in
your way here, tony.

24:58.430 --> 24:59.931
You're the one who stayed,
you took the brunt.

24:59.931 --> 25:01.933
Barbara and i, we're
never gonna forget that.

25:01.933 --> 25:06.438
Well, you forgot it okay
for about 20 years.

25:06.438 --> 25:08.440
At least barb
pitched in.

25:08.440 --> 25:10.442
I know i made
my share of mistakes.

25:10.442 --> 25:13.445
But, ma can't stay in
the hospital forever.

25:13.445 --> 25:15.447
Let me tell you something
about this stroke of hers,

25:15.447 --> 25:16.948
and i got this
from a doctor.

25:16.948 --> 25:18.450
It's called a
conversion reaction.

25:18.450 --> 25:20.952
It's a big fuckin' opera
brought on by repressed rage.

25:20.952 --> 25:22.954
It's bullshit.

25:22.954 --> 25:24.456
There was no infarc-
whatever- the- fuck.

25:24.956 --> 25:26.458
But they also said
the symptoms are

25:26.958 --> 25:28.960
the same as a stroke,
so the results is the same,

25:28.960 --> 25:30.462
she cannot take
care of herself.

25:30.462 --> 25:32.464
She's on the lam in
that fuckin' hospital,

25:32.464 --> 25:33.965
from me.

25:33.965 --> 25:35.967
Well, who did what to who,
it's not my business.

25:36.468 --> 25:38.970
All i know is mom is
bewildered by all of this.

25:38.970 --> 25:40.972
I mention you, her eyes
fill up with tears.

25:40.972 --> 25:42.474
Oh, boy.

25:42.974 --> 25:45.977
I'm not asking you
to step in, tony.

25:45.977 --> 25:49.481
It's my turn now,
that's why i came.

25:49.981 --> 25:53.485
She's a streg',
she's the devil.

25:53.485 --> 25:54.986
She was.

25:54.986 --> 25:59.991
Now, she's
just a confused,
frightened, old woman.

25:59.991 --> 26:03.495
So, look, all i need is
a couple hundred bucks.

26:03.495 --> 26:04.496
To fix her car

26:04.996 --> 26:06.998
so i can get back and
forth to the hospital.

26:06.998 --> 26:08.500
Then i'll take her
home to seattle.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.502
Maybe, stay at her
house here temporarily.

26:10.502 --> 26:12.504
Oh, i doubt that.

26:12.504 --> 26:15.006
I just put her house
on the market.

26:15.006 --> 26:17.509
Oh.

26:17.509 --> 26:23.014
Look...

26:23.014 --> 26:25.517
...i'm glad
you're here, okay?

26:26.017 --> 26:28.019
You wanna play
florence nightingale,

26:28.019 --> 26:32.023
that's your choice.

26:32.023 --> 26:33.525
Only this is
the last time

26:33.525 --> 26:35.527
we mention her
in this house.

26:35.527 --> 26:37.529
Okay.

26:53.044 --> 26:58.049
Hey, t!

26:58.550 --> 27:00.051
Seven and seven
over here.

27:00.051 --> 27:02.053
Whoa, whoa, what's
the matter now?

27:02.554 --> 27:03.555
What's the matter?

27:03.555 --> 27:05.557
I got a call from loiaco
down at the brokerage.

27:05.557 --> 27:07.559
Your two friends beat
the shit out of a broker.

27:07.559 --> 27:08.560
Two others quit.

27:08.560 --> 27:10.061
The guy was pushing
some other stock.

27:10.061 --> 27:13.064
It attracts
negative attention.

27:13.064 --> 27:15.066
Then the two fucks
rip off a porsche carrera

27:15.066 --> 27:17.068
from our
own building.

27:17.068 --> 27:18.069
I'll call them.

27:18.069 --> 27:20.071
No, you'll
go down there, now.

27:20.071 --> 27:22.073
What did you get your
license for, christopher,

27:22.073 --> 27:26.077
your resume, huh?

27:26.077 --> 27:27.579
I've been
telling you,

27:27.579 --> 27:30.081
spend more time down
at the brokerage.

27:30.081 --> 27:32.083
You're the fuckin'
sce compliance officer

27:32.083 --> 27:34.085
for christ's sake.

27:34.085 --> 27:36.588
You gotta exercise
impulse control.

27:37.088 --> 27:39.591
Okay, tony.

27:39.591 --> 27:41.092
I'm sorry.

27:41.593 --> 27:43.595
Okay, alright.

27:50.602 --> 27:53.104
I can't show it
in this condition.

27:53.104 --> 27:54.105
What the hell
is this?

27:54.606 --> 27:56.107
There's a
high school
up the street.

27:56.107 --> 27:58.109
A sink was left
on upstairs.

27:58.109 --> 28:00.612
You don't even wanna
see the toilets.

28:01.613 --> 28:04.616
Excuse me.

28:04.616 --> 28:07.619
Wait until i catch
the kids who did this.

28:08.119 --> 28:09.621
Break a few windows,

28:09.621 --> 28:10.622
they think they're
johnny bad- ass

28:11.122 --> 28:12.624
the fuckin' jackals.

28:12.624 --> 28:14.125
Will you stop,
please?

28:14.125 --> 28:16.127
Your sister barbara and
the kids are coming down.

28:16.127 --> 28:18.129
You better not be
in this mood.

28:18.630 --> 28:20.632
And i need you
to pick up sausage.

28:20.632 --> 28:22.133
Yeah, yeah,
how many pounds?

28:22.133 --> 28:23.134
Hot or sweet?

28:23.635 --> 28:25.637
Don't you act
like it's a chore.

28:25.637 --> 28:27.639
This party was
your idea.

28:27.639 --> 28:29.641
You said
you were happy
janice was home.

28:30.141 --> 28:32.644
And my parents
are coming.

28:33.144 --> 28:35.146
Oh, really?

28:35.146 --> 28:37.649
What, now that
the dragon lady's gone,

28:37.649 --> 28:39.651
they'll step foot
in our house?

28:40.151 --> 28:41.653
She said some
horrible things

28:41.653 --> 28:45.657
to them
over the years.

28:46.157 --> 28:49.160
I'm not defending her,
she's dead to me.

28:49.661 --> 28:50.662
I'm telling you,

28:50.662 --> 28:51.663
you mope your
way through this,

28:51.663 --> 28:53.164
i will cut
your throat.

28:53.164 --> 28:54.165
What are you
talking about, mope?

28:54.165 --> 28:55.166
I've been in
a great mood lately.

28:55.166 --> 28:56.668
Right.

28:56.668 --> 28:58.670
I think you need t
o start therapy again.

28:58.670 --> 29:01.673
You're self medicating
, we haven't had sex in--

29:01.673 --> 29:03.174
forget it,
no therapy.

29:03.174 --> 29:05.677
You really should
take a look

29:05.677 --> 29:08.179
at what they did to
your mother's bedroom.

29:14.185 --> 29:15.687
They're rookies,
they're young guys,

29:15.687 --> 29:17.689
they're not used to
this kinda of stress,

29:17.689 --> 29:18.690
so, they get
impulsive...

29:18.690 --> 29:20.191
he better not say
one fuckin' word.

29:20.191 --> 29:22.694
...you got
my word on that.

29:22.694 --> 29:26.698
I appreciate it,
chris, thank you.

29:26.698 --> 29:30.201
Come on in.

29:30.702 --> 29:32.704
Hey, chris, brough
t you a little capp'.

29:32.704 --> 29:34.205
Thanks.

29:34.706 --> 29:36.207
Sit down.

29:43.214 --> 29:45.717
Refresh my memory abou
t this play we're making

29:45.717 --> 29:46.718
on webistics.

29:47.218 --> 29:48.219
We own 400, 000 shares.

29:48.720 --> 29:51.723
Trade on the
bulletin board, otc.

29:51.723 --> 29:54.225
If we cold- call enough
senior citizens,
pump and dump.

29:54.225 --> 29:56.728
Yeah, listen, you guys
ain't spent much time

29:56.728 --> 29:58.730
in the nfl,
let's face it.

29:58.730 --> 30:00.732
What the fuck
you talkin' about?

30:00.732 --> 30:02.233
Two years with
eddie stakes.

30:02.233 --> 30:04.235
Besides waxing
eddie's car.

30:04.235 --> 30:05.737
When he did
the jolt in county--

30:05.737 --> 30:07.238
then you know when
you're bleedin' a guy,

30:07.739 --> 30:09.240
you don't squeeze him
dry right away.

30:09.240 --> 30:11.743
Contrarily, you let him
do his bidding,

30:11.743 --> 30:14.245
suavely.

30:14.245 --> 30:15.747
So, you can bleed him
next week

30:15.747 --> 30:22.754
and the week after,
at a minimum.

30:22.754 --> 30:25.256
You mean, we don't need one
of these guys getting pissed

30:25.256 --> 30:26.257
and running to the sce.

30:26.758 --> 30:29.260
I mean, is that
what you're saying?

30:29.260 --> 30:30.762
Break it down.

30:30.762 --> 30:32.764
Sorry, chris.

30:32.764 --> 30:33.765
Webistics is at 80,

30:34.265 --> 30:35.767
when are we
dumping the stock?

30:35.767 --> 30:37.769
You'll know that
when you need to know that.

30:37.769 --> 30:40.772
Excellent.

30:40.772 --> 30:44.776
This is cold,
by the way.

30:44.776 --> 30:45.777
Guys...

30:46.277 --> 30:48.780
anymore porsches disappear,

30:48.780 --> 30:51.783
make it two towns over,
and i want a taste.

30:52.283 --> 30:53.785
You're the man.

31:01.793 --> 31:04.796
Grandma's gonna be
so happy to see you.

31:04.796 --> 31:06.798
Grandma, it's me.

31:07.298 --> 31:08.299
Look who's here.

31:08.800 --> 31:09.801
Ma, i'm going
downstairs.

31:09.801 --> 31:12.303
You spend the whole day
on that elevator.

31:20.311 --> 31:22.313
Grandma,
you've gotta eat.

31:22.313 --> 31:24.315
Let me die.

31:24.315 --> 31:26.317
Don't say that.

31:26.317 --> 31:28.319
I saw a light,

31:28.820 --> 31:31.823
there were voices
calling out to me.

31:31.823 --> 31:33.825
Grandma, what went on
between you and dad?

31:33.825 --> 31:35.326
Mom won't tell
me anything.

31:35.326 --> 31:37.328
What, why,
what did he say?

31:37.328 --> 31:39.330
Nothing, he won't
mention you at all.

31:39.330 --> 31:41.332
Oh, that one.

31:41.332 --> 31:43.334
He blames me
for everything.

31:43.334 --> 31:45.336
I know,
me too.

31:45.837 --> 31:48.339
At night,
they hit us.

31:48.840 --> 31:50.842
Why can't this family
just get along?

31:50.842 --> 31:52.844
Some peopl
e don't wanna.

31:52.844 --> 31:54.846
But you, you
listen to him.

31:54.846 --> 31:57.348
You do what
he says.

31:57.348 --> 31:59.851
He's your father.

31:59.851 --> 32:02.854
I won't let them leave
you here like this.

32:02.854 --> 32:05.857
They can't stop me
from seeing you.

32:05.857 --> 32:10.361
Meadow, meadow,
take that.

32:10.862 --> 32:12.363
In the drawer.

32:12.363 --> 32:14.866
In the drawer,
take it.

32:20.872 --> 32:22.373
Oh, my god.

32:22.373 --> 32:24.876
This was your
grandmother's,
wasn't it?

32:24.876 --> 32:27.378
It's so you won't
forget me.

33:07.919 --> 33:09.921
Come on, motherfuck!

33:10.421 --> 33:12.423
Motherfuck...!

33:14.926 --> 33:16.928
...fuck...

33:34.445 --> 33:37.949
i told my family
i got broadsided, but,

33:38.449 --> 33:45.957
i passed out
behind the wheel.

33:45.957 --> 33:52.964
See, my mother and me,
we had a fallin' out.

33:52.964 --> 33:56.968
And, since then,
things have been good.

33:56.968 --> 33:58.970
Clean break.

33:58.970 --> 34:00.972
What kind of
falling out?

34:00.972 --> 34:03.474
One of those
unfortunate
situations.

34:03.474 --> 34:05.977
A lot of
screaming.

34:05.977 --> 34:07.979
Profanity.

34:08.478 --> 34:10.982
Anyway,
things were good.

34:11.482 --> 34:13.985
And then my sister
came back.

34:13.985 --> 34:15.485
It's good to see her,
i guess.

34:15.485 --> 34:18.489
Cues from childhood
kick in, older sister.

34:18.489 --> 34:20.491
That should be
obvious enough.

34:20.491 --> 34:21.993
Yeah, but
those feelings

34:21.993 --> 34:23.995
are starting to bleed
into my business.

34:23.995 --> 34:25.496
What sort of
business are you in?

34:25.496 --> 34:30.501
Commercial waste.

34:31.002 --> 34:33.504
Mr. Spears,

34:34.005 --> 34:36.507
i watch the news,
like everyone else.

34:36.507 --> 34:40.011
I know who you are,
and i saw "analyze this".

34:40.011 --> 34:42.513
I don't need
the ramifications
that could arise

34:43.014 --> 34:48.018
from treating someone
like yourself.

34:48.518 --> 34:50.521
"Analyze this"?

34:50.521 --> 34:53.024
Come on, it's
a fuckin' comedy.

34:53.524 --> 34:56.027
I'm not taking
new patients right now.

35:14.045 --> 35:17.048
Oh, my baby
sister!

35:17.048 --> 35:18.049
Oh, you look great.

35:18.049 --> 35:20.551
Who is thi
s little guy?

35:20.551 --> 35:22.053
Traffic was terrible.

35:22.053 --> 35:24.555
Keep it down out there,
you'll scare the neighbors.

35:26.057 --> 35:27.058
Fuck!

35:42.073 --> 35:44.075
Carm, tony says
the fire's almost ready.

35:44.575 --> 35:49.080
Great, par',
i'll be out in a second.

35:49.580 --> 35:52.083
Parvati, she's
a cheese now?

35:52.083 --> 35:53.584
It's a hindu goddess.

35:54.085 --> 35:55.086
Nice for her.

35:55.086 --> 35:56.587
She still answers
to janice, ma,

35:56.587 --> 35:58.589
if it makes you
more comfortable.

35:58.589 --> 36:02.093
Hugo, go t
o the market,

36:02.093 --> 36:04.595
pick up a couple
of cans of pears.

36:04.595 --> 36:06.597
Canned pears,
not fresh.

36:06.597 --> 36:09.100
That's the secret
to my pound cake.

36:09.100 --> 36:11.602
Get some basinigol
' while you're there.

36:12.103 --> 36:14.105
The pears,
you want
the dole?

36:14.105 --> 36:17.608
I'm not even gonna
answer this time.

36:17.608 --> 36:19.610
There is a new market, dad,
down on pompton pike.

36:19.610 --> 36:22.113
A lot of changes
since you've been here.

36:22.113 --> 36:23.114
With that
"mommy dearest" around

36:23.614 --> 36:25.116
never again,
i swore it.

36:25.116 --> 36:27.118
Which is exactly
what she wanted.

36:27.118 --> 36:29.620
You played right into
her hands with that.

36:29.620 --> 36:32.123
Remember what she said
to you at your wedding?

36:32.123 --> 36:34.125
She said it
was a mistake,

36:34.125 --> 36:36.627
tony would get
bored with you.

36:42.633 --> 36:45.136
Hey, take
it easy!

36:52.643 --> 36:55.146
I love seeing them
like that, over a fire.

36:55.146 --> 36:58.149
They're better
over a spit.

36:58.149 --> 37:02.153
Who's anthony look like
to you, right now?

37:02.153 --> 37:04.155
Dad.

37:04.155 --> 37:07.658
We stopped in to see
ma on the way over.

37:07.658 --> 37:09.660
How do you
think she is?

37:09.660 --> 37:12.663
Mom, a little weak,
but, she's all there.

37:12.663 --> 37:14.165
Some family reunion.

37:14.165 --> 37:15.666
The woman who
bore them all

37:15.666 --> 37:16.667
is barred from
the premises.

37:17.168 --> 37:18.669
I don't think you should
get too close, janice,

37:18.669 --> 37:20.671
look what she tried
to do to tony.

37:20.671 --> 37:23.174
I have no fantasies
about my mother.

37:23.174 --> 37:25.176
You know, he's trying
to sell the house?

37:25.176 --> 37:26.177
What house?

37:26.177 --> 37:30.181
Ma's house.

37:30.181 --> 37:32.183
See, that's what
i'm talking about.

37:32.183 --> 37:35.186
Don't get involved
, let tony handle it.

37:35.186 --> 37:38.689
I only called you
'cause you're far away.

37:38.689 --> 37:42.193
I thought you
would wanna know
if your mother was ill.

37:42.193 --> 37:44.195
$180, 000 he's asking
for that place.

37:44.195 --> 37:46.697
Like he needs that.

37:46.697 --> 37:49.200
Well, i'm glad
someone's taking charge.

37:49.200 --> 37:52.703
You'll get your cut.

37:52.703 --> 37:54.205
Ma's not dead yet,
and there's no will.

37:54.705 --> 37:56.707
What?

37:57.208 --> 37:59.710
I mean, ma still
has rights.

37:59.710 --> 38:02.713
Tony pays for the
retirement home,

38:02.713 --> 38:05.216
the upkeep
on her car.

38:05.216 --> 38:07.718
Hey, parvati,
take it easy.

38:07.718 --> 38:10.221
According to you, that
coulda been robert mitchum.

38:10.221 --> 38:13.224
Jesus christ, fuckin'
paulie gaultieri.

38:13.724 --> 38:17.728
Isn't he dead yet?

38:17.728 --> 38:19.230
You're not gonna
stay for dessert?

38:19.230 --> 38:20.231
We got ben
and jerry's,

38:20.231 --> 38:21.732
we got a pear grappa
cake my mother made.

38:22.233 --> 38:23.234
Yeah, i know,
but my friends

38:23.234 --> 38:25.236
are havin' this gallery
opening in chelsea.

38:25.236 --> 38:27.238
I'm tryin' to get them
to finance my video.

38:27.238 --> 38:30.741
I'll leave some
cake out for you.

38:30.741 --> 38:34.245
Hey, i'm sorry.

38:34.245 --> 38:35.246
Hey.

38:35.246 --> 38:36.247
What's up?

39:11.782 --> 39:15.786
What the fuck?

39:15.786 --> 39:17.788
I'm sure there's
an explanation.

39:17.788 --> 39:19.290
There is,
there is.

39:19.290 --> 39:21.292
Take ma back
to seattle.

39:21.792 --> 39:24.795
She came here for the
house, and a $400 car.

39:24.795 --> 39:26.297
That was the con
from the first.

39:26.297 --> 39:27.298
That's the level
she works at.

39:27.298 --> 39:28.799
Maybe the sign
was broken.

39:28.799 --> 39:30.301
Maybe it fell down.

39:30.301 --> 39:31.802
I'm still a little
fat kid to her.

39:32.303 --> 39:33.804
What does she think?
She's gonna stop
the house sale

39:33.804 --> 39:35.306
by picking up one
fuckin' sign?

39:35.306 --> 39:36.807
If she were here

39:36.807 --> 39:40.311
i'd be bouncing her
head against the wall!

39:40.311 --> 39:42.313
Look at yourself, tony.

39:42.313 --> 39:44.315
Look at how
angry you are!

39:44.315 --> 39:45.816
What do you care
about that house?

39:45.816 --> 39:47.318
It's not gonna stop
with the house.

39:47.318 --> 39:49.320
The $300 pillow which
we're gonna pay for.

39:49.320 --> 39:50.321
The video equipment,

39:50.321 --> 39:52.323
which you already
heard her talkin' about.

39:52.323 --> 39:53.824
When are you getting
back into therapy?

39:54.325 --> 39:56.827
Don't star
t with that.

39:56.827 --> 39:59.330
I'm not fuckin' insane,
and i'm not overreactin',

39:59.830 --> 40:02.333
'cause you don't know
this wretched little...!

40:02.333 --> 40:05.336
Alright, alright, this
is getting you no place.

40:05.336 --> 40:07.338
Go outside,
join the party.

40:07.338 --> 40:09.340
Be with your friends,
have some pleasure.

40:09.340 --> 40:12.343
Go ahead.

40:12.343 --> 40:13.344
Fuckin' bitch.

40:13.344 --> 40:15.846
Tony, go ahead,
go have a beer.

40:26.857 --> 40:28.359
What the fuck
are you doing?

40:28.859 --> 40:30.861
Second seatin'
coming up.

40:30.861 --> 40:33.864
Fuckin' moron.

40:33.864 --> 40:35.866
Look at my wife
over there.

40:35.866 --> 40:37.368
No wait, ton',

40:37.368 --> 40:40.371
the neighbor's st. Bernard
is on your property.

40:46.377 --> 40:47.878
You're a
fuckin' moron.

40:48.379 --> 40:50.881
Anyway, we flew
first class...

40:50.881 --> 40:52.383
what service,
forget about it.

40:52.883 --> 40:54.885
Since when do you get
frequent flier upgrades?

40:54.885 --> 40:56.887
The only time
you ever took a trip

40:56.887 --> 40:58.889
was with that rockette that
you claimed you were fuckin',

40:58.889 --> 41:00.391
and then she put
lsd in your drink.

41:00.891 --> 41:01.892
Where'd you get the tickets?
The cuban?

41:01.892 --> 41:03.894
I always thought
there was some way

41:03.894 --> 41:06.397
to divert frequent flier
mileage on a grand scale.

41:06.397 --> 41:07.898
To do that, yo
u gotta break into

41:08.399 --> 41:09.400
the airline's
main computer.

41:09.900 --> 41:11.402
What do they
call it, crackin'?

41:11.902 --> 41:12.903
Hackin'.

41:12.903 --> 41:16.907
Shelley hack,
remember her?

41:59.950 --> 42:01.452
You didn't like it?

42:01.452 --> 42:05.456
Fuck off.

42:05.456 --> 42:07.958
So, when do we get
to roll with tony?

42:07.958 --> 42:09.460
What?

42:09.460 --> 42:10.961
What, are
you trippin'?

42:10.961 --> 42:13.964
We gotta work
our way up,
get introduced.

42:13.964 --> 42:15.966
You must be deep,
hangin' out with him.

42:15.966 --> 42:16.967
Who?

42:17.468 --> 42:19.970
Mr. T. You's cap
motherfuckers together?

42:19.970 --> 42:22.473
Nah, he's
too big for that.

42:22.473 --> 42:23.974
He doesn't get
his nails dirty.

42:24.475 --> 42:26.477
You tell him,
we don't mind that shit.

42:26.477 --> 42:27.978
We'll do
anything.

42:27.978 --> 42:29.980
Wet work,
pick up his shirts.

42:29.980 --> 42:34.985
Does tony ever
talk about us?

42:34.985 --> 42:40.491
No.

42:40.491 --> 42:41.992
You gonna drink or
just sit there?

42:42.493 --> 42:43.494
Sit.

42:43.494 --> 42:44.495
What the fuck is
the matter with you?

42:44.995 --> 42:45.996
What's the matter?

42:45.996 --> 42:47.498
You leave
my gas burner on?

42:47.498 --> 42:48.999
I almost lit a cigarette,
i could have died.

42:48.999 --> 42:50.000
I apologized.

42:50.000 --> 42:51.502
Why you can't
use a lighter

42:51.502 --> 42:53.003
to cook your shit
like normal people

42:53.003 --> 42:54.505
is beyond me.

42:54.505 --> 42:56.507
When everything was finally
going good between us--

42:56.507 --> 42:58.008
shut up
about that!

42:58.008 --> 43:00.010
Why, they're still
gonna kiss your ass.

43:00.010 --> 43:04.515
They don't care
if you're a junkie.

43:04.515 --> 43:05.516
Sit down!

43:06.016 --> 43:07.518
I hate you,
fuckin' pig,
get off me.

43:08.018 --> 43:09.019
You fuckin' whore.

43:09.019 --> 43:10.521
Fuck you!

43:10.521 --> 43:13.023
That's it, go home,
get my dinner ready!

43:30.040 --> 43:34.545
Don't yell,
don't scream.

43:34.545 --> 43:41.552
All cutlery stays
right where it is.

43:41.552 --> 43:46.557
How's the bagels
in this place?

43:46.557 --> 43:49.059
Come on, you don't
answer my calls,
i got no choice.

43:49.560 --> 43:51.061
Walking away
is a choice.

43:51.061 --> 43:53.063
Ruining my practice,
it's a choice.

43:53.063 --> 43:55.566
You got your office back,
no harm done.

43:55.566 --> 43:57.568
One of my patients
committed suicide

43:57.568 --> 43:59.570
because i wasn't
available to her.

43:59.570 --> 44:02.573
You know what
that means to me?

44:02.573 --> 44:05.075
She can't eat bagels,

44:05.075 --> 44:09.079
she can't call in sick
because she's feeling blue,

44:09.580 --> 44:11.582
she's gone.

44:11.582 --> 44:14.084
She's in the ground,
because of you.

44:19.590 --> 44:21.592
I don't deserve
your help.

44:21.592 --> 44:24.094
I hate your
fuckin' system,
i told you.

44:24.094 --> 44:29.600
Fuck you.

44:29.600 --> 44:32.603
But, i got a family,
and believe it or not,

44:32.603 --> 44:35.105
they're better off
with me than without me.

44:35.606 --> 44:37.608
I don't know
what else to do.

44:37.608 --> 44:40.611
I drove off the road
a couple days back.

44:40.611 --> 44:42.112
You look fine.

44:42.112 --> 44:45.115
The air bag.

44:45.616 --> 44:48.619
You always told me
if i was drivin'--

44:48.619 --> 44:51.622
that was a different
time for us.

45:00.130 --> 45:01.632
Alright,
i don't blame you.

45:01.632 --> 45:05.135
Maybe you can recommend
somebody else?

45:05.135 --> 45:07.137
I would never ask
another colleague

45:07.638 --> 45:09.640
to get involved
in this.

45:09.640 --> 45:11.141
How many more
people have to die

45:11.141 --> 45:13.143
for your
personal growth?

45:13.143 --> 45:14.144
Look at me.

45:14.645 --> 45:16.146
I swear,
to jesus christ,

45:16.146 --> 45:22.653
nobody got killed
because of you.

45:22.653 --> 45:24.655
Get out of my life.

46:05.696 --> 46:08.198
Hey.

46:08.198 --> 46:11.702
What are you doing
home at this hour?

46:11.702 --> 46:15.706
Nothing.

46:15.706 --> 46:18.709
I thought it was a. J. ,
home from school.

46:18.709 --> 46:20.210
Yeah.

46:34.725 --> 46:36.226
You alright?

46:36.226 --> 46:37.728
Yeah.

46:44.234 --> 46:46.236
Want a little
cold past'?

46:46.737 --> 46:48.238
I can microwave it.

47:31.782 --> 47:33.784
Looks good.

47:34.284 --> 47:36.286
You want cheese?
Something to drink?

47:36.286 --> 47:37.287
No.

47:44.294 --> 47:46.296
Sit down.
