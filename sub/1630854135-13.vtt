WEBVTT

00:04.526 --> 00:07.137
<i>In the nation's
largest city,</i>

00:07.137 --> 00:09.835
<i>the vicious and violent
members of the underworld</i>

00:09.835 --> 00:11.315
<i>are hunted by the detectives</i>

00:11.315 --> 00:14.666
<i>of the Organized Crime
Control Bureau.</i>

00:14.666 --> 00:17.234
<i>These are their stories.</i>

00:18.540 --> 00:20.672
I didn't shoot your partner.

00:20.672 --> 00:22.065
<i>Eamonn Murphy did.</i>

00:22.065 --> 00:25.329
I took this police academy ring
off his finger.

00:25.329 --> 00:26.504
<i>I'm Rika Harold.</i>

00:26.504 --> 00:28.028
You work for the DA's office?

00:28.028 --> 00:30.160
I had a lot of crossover
with your unit in the past,

00:30.160 --> 00:32.423
and now with Eamonn Murphy.

00:32.423 --> 00:34.338
He has basically shot, stabbed,

00:34.338 --> 00:36.297
and stolen his way up
to being a boss.

00:36.297 --> 00:38.777
He runs his criminal
operation out of local bars,

00:38.777 --> 00:41.519
<i>using them as drop-offs
for drugs, gambling.</i>

00:41.519 --> 00:43.695
Our job is to get him
with the crew.

00:43.695 --> 00:44.827
Try and turn someone.

00:44.827 --> 00:48.178
<i>His number two
is Seamus O'Meara.</i>

00:48.178 --> 00:50.615
<i>So you want to use my bar?</i>

00:52.487 --> 00:54.228
You did great work tonight, Jet.

00:54.228 --> 00:56.230
Thank you.

00:56.230 --> 00:58.536
<i>I didn't hate it.</i>

01:09.547 --> 01:12.072
I had a thought about you
last night.

01:12.072 --> 01:14.552
You did, did you?

01:14.552 --> 01:18.687
Yeah, I thought,
she's not who she says she is.

01:21.298 --> 01:24.780
You're hiding from me.

01:24.780 --> 01:27.348
<i>What am I hiding?</i>

01:27.348 --> 01:29.132
<i>Who you really are.</i>

01:33.136 --> 01:34.485
Give me your hands.

01:45.844 --> 01:49.239
This dinner with O'Meara is
a pretty big step up for you.

01:49.239 --> 01:50.980
I want to make sure
you're ready.

01:50.980 --> 01:53.939
I've gone undercover before
to get info on a mark.

01:53.939 --> 01:56.986
When we've gone undercover
before, it's to make a deal.

01:56.986 --> 02:01.904
This is to cultivate
an emotional relationship.

02:01.904 --> 02:05.560
And if you want him to believe
it, you have to believe it.

02:05.560 --> 02:07.170
And the only way you do that

02:07.170 --> 02:10.130
is by keeping your emotions
in check.

02:15.831 --> 02:18.225
You're an artist.

02:18.225 --> 02:22.185
These are the hands
of somebody who creates.

02:22.185 --> 02:23.708
You a painter?

02:25.188 --> 02:27.147
Mostly digital art.

02:29.192 --> 02:31.238
Yeah.

02:32.717 --> 02:34.371
What about you?

02:34.371 --> 02:36.199
What are you hiding from me?

02:36.199 --> 02:38.332
Me?

02:38.332 --> 02:40.595
I don't hide from anyone.

02:44.686 --> 02:45.774
Close your eyes.

02:47.471 --> 02:50.300
Come on.
Close your eyes.

03:10.929 --> 03:13.541
This is who I am.

03:17.284 --> 03:19.329
We just need you
to keep O'Meara occupied

03:19.329 --> 03:20.678
until the Morellos show up.

03:20.678 --> 03:22.593
We have our interaction hopefully,

03:22.593 --> 03:24.856
and that will lead Murphy
to our doorstep.

03:24.856 --> 03:26.380
Yo, Chief.

03:26.380 --> 03:28.556
Can we get, uh, two Cape Cods?

03:28.556 --> 03:31.211
Let's get some drinks
over here.

03:31.211 --> 03:33.387
What if things
get out of hand?

03:36.390 --> 03:38.609
That's
what we're counting on.

03:40.132 --> 03:42.483
What's going on?

03:42.483 --> 03:44.702
Whoa. Look at this.

03:44.702 --> 03:47.401
I didn't realize
they let donkeys in here.

03:49.098 --> 03:50.360
Seamus.

03:50.360 --> 03:52.493
It's all right.
Don't worry.

03:53.755 --> 03:55.626
Hey, buddy, you want me
to buy you a drink

03:55.626 --> 03:57.976
because I know you probably
can't afford your own.

03:57.976 --> 04:00.240
You know whose bar this is?

04:00.240 --> 04:01.502
Yeah, it's, uh--

04:01.502 --> 04:03.330
it's our bar.

04:03.330 --> 04:05.245
Everything all right here?

04:05.245 --> 04:07.290
Yeah, everything's fine.

04:07.290 --> 04:11.338
Just, uh, get your donkey
out of my face.

04:12.382 --> 04:13.775
What the?

04:22.523 --> 04:24.133
You OK?
Come sit down.

04:24.133 --> 04:26.309
No. Look, look, look,
I got to go now, all right?

04:26.309 --> 04:28.529
Promise I'm gonna
make this up to you.

04:28.529 --> 04:29.965
Where are you going?

04:29.965 --> 04:31.401
Work.

04:38.365 --> 04:39.627
That went pretty well.

04:41.716 --> 04:43.152
Let's go.
- I'm fine.

04:43.152 --> 04:46.634
Get some ice.

05:57.792 --> 05:59.750
- My guys did good.
- Mm-hmm.

05:59.750 --> 06:01.273
You looked pretty tough yourself.

06:01.273 --> 06:02.449
Well, they wouldn't be
the first idiots

06:02.449 --> 06:03.928
I've thrown out of a bar.

06:03.928 --> 06:05.408
Yeah, I could have
guessed that about you.

06:05.408 --> 06:06.627
So how much time
you think the DA

06:06.627 --> 06:07.932
will give him off for this?

06:07.932 --> 06:10.239
Two bozos
from the Morello mafia

06:10.239 --> 06:12.633
we busted on a misdemeanor
who did you a favor?

06:12.633 --> 06:14.678
- Mm-hmm.
- It's not my call.

06:14.678 --> 06:17.855
But, uh, if they help you
take down Murphy,

06:17.855 --> 06:19.553
I'm guessing a lesser charge.

06:19.553 --> 06:20.945
I appreciate your help
in setting it up.

06:20.945 --> 06:22.686
Oh, it was your idea.
Just glad I could help.

06:22.686 --> 06:24.688
Well, any time
I can return the favor...

06:24.688 --> 06:26.516
- Oh, there will be a time.
- Mm.

06:26.516 --> 06:27.648
You'll just let me know
if this works out

06:27.648 --> 06:28.997
with Murphy,
all right?

06:28.997 --> 06:31.216
Would I be gloating
if I said it already has?

06:31.216 --> 06:33.567
No. Seriously?

06:33.567 --> 06:35.090
Let's just say
he'll be knocking on my door

06:35.090 --> 06:36.134
this afternoon.

06:56.111 --> 06:57.373
Finally.

06:57.373 --> 07:00.071
We're freezing our asses off
out here.

07:02.596 --> 07:05.033
There a magic word
or something?

07:05.033 --> 07:07.209
Come in.

07:10.168 --> 07:13.128
I like what you did
with the place.

07:13.128 --> 07:16.610
I'm not sold on the new name, though.

07:18.960 --> 07:20.135
Jack, stay.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.097
You see that?

07:26.097 --> 07:27.708
Like a statue.

07:29.623 --> 07:32.495
Jack always does
what I tell him.

07:32.495 --> 07:35.585
I expect my crew
to do the same.

07:43.201 --> 07:44.681
So when Teddy calls

07:44.681 --> 07:49.381
and says you're not
paying tribute this month,

07:49.381 --> 07:53.168
I figure
we have a conversation.

07:55.257 --> 07:57.172
All right, Jack, eat up.

08:20.717 --> 08:22.850
Just saved you a trip
to the vet.

08:25.679 --> 08:27.376
Take it off your bill.

08:27.376 --> 08:29.509
Or I could add it to yours.

08:29.509 --> 08:31.075
I pay for protection.

08:31.075 --> 08:33.556
Where was it last night when
the Morellos wanted to riot?

08:35.384 --> 08:37.299
You got some balls on you.

08:38.692 --> 08:40.389
Maybe I feed 'em to Jack.

08:40.389 --> 08:42.043
You could try.

08:43.740 --> 08:46.264
You want
the kind of protection

08:46.264 --> 08:48.832
that keeps the Morellos
from walking in here,

08:48.832 --> 08:50.225
bring me in as a partner.

08:50.225 --> 08:51.531
I don't want a partner.

08:51.531 --> 08:53.271
I want protection.

08:53.271 --> 08:56.057
50% of the house.

08:56.057 --> 08:57.188
10.

08:59.147 --> 09:00.888
Let's go, Jack.

09:08.635 --> 09:10.071
20.

09:11.420 --> 09:13.117
25.

09:15.250 --> 09:17.600
But I need you
to show your face in here.

09:17.600 --> 09:19.863
Let the neighborhood know
who's in charge.

09:19.863 --> 09:22.083
If you agree to that,
we got a deal.

09:24.651 --> 09:27.044
I want the cameras gone.

09:27.044 --> 09:28.785
And I want the names
and socials

09:28.785 --> 09:30.570
of everyone in this place,

09:30.570 --> 09:32.223
even the dishwashers.

09:32.223 --> 09:34.574
They'll be on your table
tomorrow night.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.010
No.

09:39.666 --> 09:41.755
You'll bring them
to me personally,

09:41.755 --> 09:45.193
along with $20k
for this opportunity.

09:45.193 --> 09:46.673
Sound fair?

09:48.152 --> 09:50.633
Fair enough.
Where do I find you?

09:50.633 --> 09:54.594
Figure it out, tough guy.

09:54.594 --> 09:56.247
Come on, Jack.

10:05.300 --> 10:07.084
That Murphy is not
stepping foot in that bar

10:07.084 --> 10:08.912
until he gets backgrounds
on everyone.

10:08.912 --> 10:10.174
You can make that happen?

10:10.174 --> 10:12.002
How thorough
do you want them?

10:12.002 --> 10:13.961
Like Cambridge Analytica thorough.

10:13.961 --> 10:16.267
- Mm.
- What's your plan, Stabler?

10:16.267 --> 10:18.269
I'd like to hear from O'Meara
after he left last night.

10:18.269 --> 10:21.664
That would let me know
how to proceed.

10:21.664 --> 10:23.318
You're up.

10:26.364 --> 10:28.366
Hey, baby.

10:28.366 --> 10:31.282
I haven't heard from you.
Is everything OK?

10:31.282 --> 10:33.415
I'm good, yeah.

10:33.415 --> 10:35.635
<i>What happened after
you left the bar last night?</i>

10:35.635 --> 10:37.985
Just business.

10:38.899 --> 10:40.857
<i>Are you gonna be
at the bar tonight?</i>

10:40.857 --> 10:42.467
<i>I want to see you.</i>

10:42.467 --> 10:44.513
I can't.

10:44.513 --> 10:46.820
<i>Well, where will you be?</i>

10:46.820 --> 10:49.561
<i>I'll come to you.</i>

10:49.561 --> 10:51.259
You don't want to do that.

10:51.259 --> 10:53.870
<i>Yes, I do.
I'm worried about you.</i>

10:53.870 --> 10:55.698
<i>Don't be.</i>

10:55.698 --> 10:58.353
Seamus,
you're hiding from me.

11:08.842 --> 11:11.192
If you really want me
to see who you are,

11:11.192 --> 11:14.021
you can't shut me out
like this.

11:15.152 --> 11:16.806
You know what?
You're right, all right?

11:16.806 --> 11:18.025
I'll pick you up at 8:00.

11:18.025 --> 11:20.331
And then you can see
what I'm all about.

11:40.525 --> 11:41.744
Turn up Jet's mic.

11:41.744 --> 11:43.180
I want to know
what's happening in there.

11:43.180 --> 11:45.400
<i>You ever been to Santa Fe?</i>

11:46.401 --> 11:48.185
New Mexico?

11:48.185 --> 11:49.839
No.

11:49.839 --> 11:53.321
I went there once
when I was a kid.

11:53.321 --> 11:57.586
The mountains there
are just crazy.

11:58.369 --> 12:00.720
You know, even the air,
it's just--

12:00.720 --> 12:02.373
it's different.

12:08.336 --> 12:11.556
If we went there,
you could paint.

12:11.556 --> 12:13.341
I could get you a studio.

12:15.909 --> 12:18.433
And we could run it together.

12:22.698 --> 12:24.831
Is that what you want?

12:29.226 --> 12:31.359
What's he doing here?

12:39.541 --> 12:42.109
I didn't know you were coming.

12:42.109 --> 12:44.154
That why
you brought your girlfriend?

12:50.465 --> 12:52.380
Nice to see you again.

12:55.731 --> 12:57.428
I like your ring.

12:57.428 --> 13:01.128
Not mine originally,
but I think I wear it well.

13:02.520 --> 13:05.872
<i>Is that
a police academy ring?</i>

13:05.872 --> 13:08.178
<i>You're very observant.</i>

13:08.178 --> 13:10.790
That's Jennings' ring.
It has to be.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.835
We need to be patient.

13:27.502 --> 13:31.114
Next time, you leave
your girlfriend at home.

13:38.208 --> 13:41.081
OK, now who is this one?

13:49.524 --> 13:51.569
The man stepping off
the helicopter last night

13:51.569 --> 13:52.962
is James "Goliath" Kenneally,

13:52.962 --> 13:55.878
one of Ireland's great
bareknuckle boxing champs.

13:55.878 --> 13:56.879
What's he doing here?

13:56.879 --> 13:58.663
And why
such a grand entrance?

13:58.663 --> 14:00.927
Well, we evidently
miscalculated the level of heat

14:00.927 --> 14:02.972
that's been simmering
between the Morellos

14:02.972 --> 14:04.060
and the Murphy gang,

14:04.060 --> 14:06.846
and our manufactured dispute

14:06.846 --> 14:09.152
has brought them
to the brink of open warfare.

14:09.152 --> 14:11.459
So Murphy,
being old-school,

14:11.459 --> 14:14.331
has proposed settling the
dispute the old-fashioned way.

14:14.331 --> 14:15.898
With bareknuckle boxing?

14:15.898 --> 14:17.378
It has been a way
to settle disputes

14:17.378 --> 14:19.467
in Murphy's world
for a very long time.

14:19.467 --> 14:21.512
And the Morellos are
actually buying into this?

14:21.512 --> 14:23.166
Well,
what would you rather have:

14:23.166 --> 14:25.734
two boxers busting each other's
heads open or a body count?

14:25.734 --> 14:26.778
So yeah.

14:28.345 --> 14:30.391
- It's Seamus.
- Go.

14:30.391 --> 14:31.914
Have they decided
on a location yet?

14:31.914 --> 14:33.524
We're going to help them
decide that.

14:33.524 --> 14:35.918
So you're going to ask Thurman
about extra backup?

14:35.918 --> 14:37.180
Not to push the agenda

14:37.180 --> 14:38.355
and make the night
more complicated,

14:38.355 --> 14:40.140
but we got the guy

14:40.140 --> 14:42.272
who bought for Murphy's crew
the other night at Rikers.

14:42.272 --> 14:43.883
Maybe it's a good opportunity

14:43.883 --> 14:45.406
to get Murphy
in the middle of a drug deal.

14:48.539 --> 14:51.107
We're already
in the deep end.

14:51.107 --> 14:53.501
You guys try to persuade him.
I'll make a call.

14:53.501 --> 14:54.894
Keep this under the radar.

14:56.504 --> 14:58.332
Where are you going?
- To set up a boxing match.

15:00.160 --> 15:03.250
Seamus wants to meet.
He's picking me up at 6:00.

15:03.250 --> 15:05.948
Hey, I need you
to look at something.

15:05.948 --> 15:08.559
Last night,
the ring Murphy was wearing,

15:08.559 --> 15:09.560
did it look like that?

15:09.560 --> 15:11.345
Exactly like that.

15:11.345 --> 15:14.043
Are you sure?

15:14.043 --> 15:15.044
Positive.

15:18.221 --> 15:20.441
Sarge, do you need me to--

15:20.441 --> 15:22.660
I need you to stay focused.

15:26.795 --> 15:29.754
Murphy has Jennings' ring.
- Hello, Ayanna.

15:29.754 --> 15:31.626
The one that was taken
from him the day of the murder.

15:31.626 --> 15:35.412
My UC saw it on Murphy's hand
the other night.

15:35.412 --> 15:37.762
What are you trying
to tell me?

15:37.762 --> 15:39.590
I know you've had your doubts

15:39.590 --> 15:42.202
about my motives
to pursuing Murphy,

15:42.202 --> 15:44.987
and I'm letting you know
that my instincts were right.

15:44.987 --> 15:46.989
I never questioned
your instincts.

15:46.989 --> 15:49.513
It's your judgment
I'm worried about.

15:51.820 --> 15:53.953
We're setting up a sting
to nail Murphy.

15:53.953 --> 15:57.391
We need extra bodies
just in case it gets ugly.

15:57.391 --> 15:59.045
In my judgment.

16:01.264 --> 16:02.874
Look, I can't give you
extra manpower--

16:02.874 --> 16:05.355
- You're putting lives at risk.
- You didn't let me finish.

16:07.270 --> 16:08.837
I won't give you extra manpower

16:08.837 --> 16:11.666
when IAB is opening
an investigation into you.

16:16.279 --> 16:17.498
Why is IA...

16:22.503 --> 16:24.635
You went to them.

16:24.635 --> 16:27.290
Hmm, you know,
it just never made sense to me

16:27.290 --> 16:32.034
that you turned down this job.

16:32.034 --> 16:34.994
But now, I think...

16:34.994 --> 16:37.822
I understand.

16:37.822 --> 16:40.521
You're just like your friend,
Detective Stabler.

16:40.521 --> 16:42.914
You need to do things
your own way,

16:42.914 --> 16:45.395
and you knew it wouldn't be
easy to go off the reservation

16:45.395 --> 16:47.049
in a position
of such high authority.

16:47.049 --> 16:49.095
Let me tell you something.

16:49.095 --> 16:52.315
I chose to keep my job
because I love my team,

16:52.315 --> 16:54.274
and I trust them

16:54.274 --> 16:58.321
much more than I trust
the politics in this building.

16:58.321 --> 16:59.714
And when it comes to me

16:59.714 --> 17:03.022
solving the murder
of my former partner,

17:03.022 --> 17:06.416
no one is gonna stop me.

17:14.120 --> 17:16.339
You want me to buy drugs?

17:16.339 --> 17:17.949
No.

17:17.949 --> 17:20.735
We want you
to buy some more drugs.

17:20.735 --> 17:22.345
Same guys as before?

17:22.345 --> 17:24.043
You bought
from Murphy's crew.

17:24.043 --> 17:25.522
This time,
it's got to be Murphy himself.

17:25.522 --> 17:27.611
Murphy?

17:27.611 --> 17:29.352
You know the stories
about that guy?

17:29.352 --> 17:31.876
About his dog?

17:31.876 --> 17:35.097
I ain't getting
anywhere near that psycho.

17:35.097 --> 17:36.316
Find somebody else.

17:36.316 --> 17:37.404
Guard!

17:37.404 --> 17:39.101
Gustavo.

17:42.583 --> 17:44.585
He's not gonna
suspect anything.

17:47.675 --> 17:49.503
It's got to be you.

17:51.418 --> 17:52.897
I want all charges dropped.

17:52.897 --> 17:54.769
- That's up to the DA.
- And us.

17:55.987 --> 17:57.511
If we say
we didn't have to beg,

17:57.511 --> 18:00.644
you wanted to serve
the people of New York,

18:00.644 --> 18:02.907
who knows
what miracles might happen?

18:05.127 --> 18:06.172
<i>You know,
you never told me</i>

18:06.172 --> 18:08.087
<i>what it is
you do for a living.</i>

18:10.001 --> 18:12.178
<i>I work.</i>

18:12.178 --> 18:15.181
You sure say that word a lot,
don't you?

18:15.181 --> 18:16.791
Yeah.

18:21.317 --> 18:23.102
So what does it mean?

18:26.931 --> 18:29.978
It means I make a living.

18:34.330 --> 18:36.158
I need you to stop the car.

18:36.158 --> 18:37.333
What do you mean
"stop the car"?

18:37.333 --> 18:38.552
Just stop the car!

18:38.552 --> 18:39.770
All right, hang on.
Hang on. Hang on.

18:39.770 --> 18:41.772
- Is she in trouble?
- She's fine.

18:41.772 --> 18:43.687
She's reeling him in.

18:45.863 --> 18:47.169
I can't do this anymore.

18:47.169 --> 18:48.257
Whoa.

18:48.257 --> 18:49.563
Hey!

18:51.173 --> 18:54.089
Hey, come on.
What are you doing?

18:56.222 --> 18:57.614
<i>Hey. Hey.</i>

18:57.614 --> 19:00.487
What's going on?
- I know what you do.

19:04.447 --> 19:07.058
That guy you beat up
at the bar?

19:07.058 --> 19:09.409
He's a Morello.

19:09.409 --> 19:11.802
And I know who Murphy is.

19:11.802 --> 19:15.154
Everyone
in this neighborhood does.

19:20.289 --> 19:23.510
What do you want me to say?

19:23.510 --> 19:25.773
The truth.

19:27.862 --> 19:31.039
So this can be
what we want it to be.

19:34.129 --> 19:37.654
If I tell you the truth,
I don't want you to leave.

19:37.654 --> 19:40.788
What, are you scared?

19:42.398 --> 19:46.663
<i>I'm more scared
that you won't respect me.</i>

19:46.663 --> 19:51.886
Seamus, I wouldn't be here if
I didn't already respect you.

20:08.642 --> 20:11.035
- Who am I looking at?
- A Morello gang hitman.

20:11.035 --> 20:12.776
Michael Amato.

20:12.776 --> 20:14.996
His brother, Gio, is the one
who we had pick a fight

20:14.996 --> 20:17.259
with O'Meara at the bar.

20:17.259 --> 20:19.174
I think
there's a contract out on him.

20:19.174 --> 20:20.349
Who put it out?

20:20.349 --> 20:21.742
Murphy.

20:21.742 --> 20:23.222
Did O'Meara tell you that?

20:26.137 --> 20:27.269
No.

20:27.269 --> 20:29.445
Then what makes you so sure?

20:29.445 --> 20:31.578
How Seamus has been acting.

20:33.319 --> 20:35.625
Please don't force me
to use the expression

20:35.625 --> 20:37.236
"women's intuition."

20:39.586 --> 20:41.457
Well, we could
put a tail on O'Meara.

20:41.457 --> 20:44.547
If she's right,
and we get him on attempted,

20:44.547 --> 20:46.897
we have a better chance
at flipping him.

20:46.897 --> 20:49.073
He doesn't want to do it.

20:49.073 --> 20:50.858
He doesn't want to do what?
The hit?

20:50.858 --> 20:53.295
No, this.

20:53.295 --> 20:55.166
Everything he's a part of.

20:56.733 --> 20:59.170
I see the role he's playing.

21:06.743 --> 21:08.267
I know how this sounds

21:08.267 --> 21:10.269
and I know
what you both are thinking,

21:10.269 --> 21:12.445
but a good detective uses
every tool at their disposal,

21:12.445 --> 21:15.578
and I am telling you that what
I feel about Seamus is right.

21:17.319 --> 21:19.669
OK, if he doesn't do the hit,

21:19.669 --> 21:22.281
how long
do you think he's gonna last?

21:23.760 --> 21:26.285
- Let me talk to him.
- Well, with all due respect,

21:26.285 --> 21:28.243
we've already done
a lot of talking.

21:32.552 --> 21:34.336
Sarge?

21:38.209 --> 21:40.211
- We got a problem.
- Where's Gustavo?

21:40.211 --> 21:41.648
He got cold feet.

21:41.648 --> 21:44.346
If we don't have a buyer,
we don't have a bust.

21:44.346 --> 21:46.043
That's not our only problem.

21:46.043 --> 21:47.131
Murphy just got here.

21:49.046 --> 21:51.092
And he doesn't know about this.

21:51.092 --> 21:52.963
We didn't have time
to call it off.

21:52.963 --> 21:54.530
I know.

21:54.530 --> 21:58.099
You guys get to the back,
and I'll take care of it.

22:08.196 --> 22:09.893
I'm supposed to be
meeting someone here.

22:09.893 --> 22:10.894
Where is he?

22:10.894 --> 22:13.723
I, uh--I threw him out.

22:15.638 --> 22:18.815
That degenerate got my last
place put under surveillance.

22:20.251 --> 22:21.557
He's just not subtle.

22:21.557 --> 22:23.820
You know, you don't want
that kind of heat in here.

22:25.169 --> 22:27.824
I don't recall
you ever asking me what I want.

22:29.609 --> 22:31.350
<i>I'm trying to make this
the kind of place</i>

22:31.350 --> 22:33.874
<i>where you feel safe
doing business.</i>

22:33.874 --> 22:35.136
You know,
so that means

22:35.136 --> 22:37.660
I've got to protect
our mutual interests.

22:38.835 --> 22:41.621
We don't have
mutual interests yet.

22:43.536 --> 22:46.277
My interests
are all that matter.

22:50.456 --> 22:51.848
Let me hear you say it.

22:54.982 --> 22:56.462
Boy.

23:06.559 --> 23:11.346
I think your interests are
all that matter right now,

23:11.346 --> 23:13.435
so I apologize.

23:13.435 --> 23:16.612
And I give you my word,

23:16.612 --> 23:20.050
I'll do everything
to make it up to you.

23:21.965 --> 23:25.621
You should certainly try.

23:39.243 --> 23:41.420
What are you gonna do now?

23:41.420 --> 23:43.726
Set up another buy.

23:43.726 --> 23:44.945
With what buyer?

23:46.642 --> 23:47.817
Teddy.

24:09.839 --> 24:12.320
So you are alive.

24:14.888 --> 24:18.457
You don't answer my texts,
my calls.

24:18.457 --> 24:21.851
What are you doing here?

24:21.851 --> 24:23.679
You're avoiding me.

24:23.679 --> 24:26.813
I'm not avoiding you.

24:26.813 --> 24:29.293
I have, uh--

24:29.293 --> 24:32.688
I have work I need to do.

24:32.688 --> 24:35.691
What work?

24:35.691 --> 24:36.866
Uh...

24:40.174 --> 24:43.003
I thought we were gonna
be honest with each other.

24:43.003 --> 24:44.570
Remember?

24:47.573 --> 24:49.618
And you're gonna kill someone?

24:49.618 --> 24:51.011
- Don't ask me that.
- Seamus--

24:51.011 --> 24:52.447
Look, you don't know
how this works, all right?

24:52.447 --> 24:55.537
What I have to do,
why I have to.

24:57.844 --> 24:59.498
Then tell me.

25:05.329 --> 25:06.635
I have a debt to pay.

25:06.635 --> 25:09.638
I pay the debt, I get out.

25:09.638 --> 25:12.685
If you kill someone
for Murphy,

25:12.685 --> 25:15.252
you're not getting out ever.

25:15.252 --> 25:17.733
I don't have a choice.

25:20.388 --> 25:22.346
What about New Mexico?

25:26.307 --> 25:29.615
What about our art gallery?

25:34.054 --> 25:37.579
We can figure all this out.

25:39.494 --> 25:42.323
Just stay with me, please.

25:45.848 --> 25:49.504
You don't know what
you'd be getting yourself into.

25:51.201 --> 25:54.422
I can take care of myself.

26:03.387 --> 26:05.433
You gotta go.

26:09.437 --> 26:12.179
This is your last chance. Go.

26:56.049 --> 26:57.398
Where have you been?

26:57.398 --> 26:58.660
Home.

26:58.660 --> 27:00.706
Getting ready for work.

27:00.706 --> 27:02.882
- Sarge wants to see you.
- OK.

27:02.882 --> 27:04.448
Jet.

27:21.770 --> 27:24.033
I'm gonna give you one chance
to explain yourself

27:24.033 --> 27:26.079
before I take you off the case.

27:27.646 --> 27:29.560
Explain myself about what?

27:56.152 --> 27:58.154
You had me followed last night?

27:58.154 --> 27:59.939
You were supposed to be
finding out about the hit.

27:59.939 --> 28:01.375
That's all.

28:01.375 --> 28:03.594
He was on his way to do it
when I got there.

28:03.594 --> 28:04.726
I had to stop him.

28:04.726 --> 28:06.119
Find another way.

28:06.119 --> 28:08.121
I didn't sleep with him.

28:09.775 --> 28:11.167
It doesn't matter.

28:11.167 --> 28:13.082
A jury is gonna
see those photos,

28:13.082 --> 28:15.215
and they're gonna
believe that you did.

28:15.215 --> 28:18.044
Then your testimony
is gonna be biased

28:18.044 --> 28:21.003
and this entire case ruined.

28:23.919 --> 28:26.487
So throw them away.

28:28.402 --> 28:32.145
Please, Stabler has done
so much worse than this.

28:32.145 --> 28:34.713
We are not talking
about Detective Stabler.

28:38.455 --> 28:40.066
No, we aren't.

28:40.066 --> 28:42.503
We're talking about me and you.

28:42.503 --> 28:45.767
And you never believed
I was ready for this.

28:45.767 --> 28:47.377
Well, I am,

28:47.377 --> 28:49.553
I have been,

28:49.553 --> 28:51.251
and you need to show me
the same respect

28:51.251 --> 28:52.643
you show everyone else
in this office.

28:52.643 --> 28:56.125
Oh, the same way
you're showing me respect now?

28:56.125 --> 28:57.779
You're the one
who told me to step up,

28:57.779 --> 28:59.085
and that's what I'm doing.

28:59.085 --> 29:01.130
By falling for O'Meara?

29:03.350 --> 29:05.265
I'm not falling for him.

29:07.658 --> 29:09.008
Then why are you
still wearing

29:09.008 --> 29:11.010
the necklace he gave you?

29:27.330 --> 29:29.115
I'm taking you off the case

29:29.115 --> 29:32.596
until I can figure out
how to manage this.

29:32.596 --> 29:34.381
That's the end of it.

29:38.559 --> 29:43.520
Giovanni mentioned that you
lost an opportunity recently.

29:43.520 --> 29:45.827
He did, did he?

29:45.827 --> 29:49.135
Look, he can get a little
paranoid with the security,

29:49.135 --> 29:52.442
but that's what makes him good
at his job.

29:52.442 --> 29:53.661
I'd like to make it up to you.

29:53.661 --> 29:56.011
That product
you were gonna sell,

29:56.011 --> 29:58.013
let me take that
off your hands.

30:00.842 --> 30:04.324
You're gonna buy
$50,000 worth of cocaine?

30:05.978 --> 30:07.283
Yes.

30:07.283 --> 30:09.677
And host your fight at my bar.

30:09.677 --> 30:12.158
I already have a location
for the fight.

30:13.507 --> 30:15.596
This dump?

30:15.596 --> 30:16.771
No offense.

30:16.771 --> 30:18.251
It's a nice enough spot
for a hangout.

30:18.251 --> 30:21.341
But you want a big crowd?

30:21.341 --> 30:23.169
You want a lot of high rollers?

30:24.518 --> 30:26.172
I can take care of them
for you.

30:26.172 --> 30:28.217
I know how to do that.

30:32.874 --> 30:36.138
I want 80% of the profits.

30:36.138 --> 30:38.097
Won't do that.

30:41.578 --> 30:44.843
Good,
'cause if you said yes,

30:44.843 --> 30:47.628
I'd think you were trying
to set me up for something

30:47.628 --> 30:50.152
or even working
with the police.

30:50.152 --> 30:53.199
Police?

30:53.199 --> 30:55.723
After what they did
to my father?

30:57.812 --> 31:00.815
We'll split the profits 50/50.
You take care of security.

31:05.211 --> 31:07.822
Just so we're clear,

31:07.822 --> 31:10.172
if I find out
you're up to anything

31:10.172 --> 31:12.566
other than being generous...

31:15.351 --> 31:18.093
See you tomorrow night.

31:19.399 --> 31:21.749
See you tomorrow night.

31:43.945 --> 31:45.947
You took the photos.

31:45.947 --> 31:48.950
Sarge gave the orders.

31:48.950 --> 31:50.647
I had to.

31:55.261 --> 31:56.392
You could have warned me

31:56.392 --> 31:58.655
before I got called
into her office.

32:00.396 --> 32:02.398
What good
would that have done?

32:06.359 --> 32:11.581
Look, I know it's hard
when you're deep in.

32:11.581 --> 32:13.148
You forget
the boundaries, right?

32:13.148 --> 32:16.195
I mean, I've gone through it.

32:16.195 --> 32:17.718
Jet.

32:20.155 --> 32:21.983
You did a good thing.

32:21.983 --> 32:24.464
You may have actually prevented
someone from getting killed,

32:24.464 --> 32:27.293
but Bell's got a job to do too.

32:27.293 --> 32:30.296
She's got to build a case.

32:30.296 --> 32:32.472
You want her to trust you?

32:32.472 --> 32:35.866
Prove to her
that you can do your job

32:35.866 --> 32:38.521
and not be a threat to hers.

32:46.051 --> 32:47.748
OK, I love him.

32:47.748 --> 32:50.011
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

32:50.011 --> 32:52.274
How much have you had to drink?

32:52.274 --> 32:55.799
I have not been drinking.

32:55.799 --> 32:57.845
All right.
I'm gonna get you some water.

32:57.845 --> 32:59.064
Wait.

32:59.064 --> 33:02.719
Do not throw up on my sofa.

33:08.943 --> 33:10.858
You were right.

33:10.858 --> 33:13.556
I did fall for him.

33:13.556 --> 33:16.255
Seamus is such a wonderful man.

33:16.255 --> 33:20.041
And if you just spent
some time with him--

33:20.041 --> 33:21.608
Sit up.

33:26.091 --> 33:29.181
I feel like...

33:29.181 --> 33:32.271
he gets me.

33:32.271 --> 33:36.623
He, like, sees me
for who I really am.

33:42.063 --> 33:43.760
Do you see me right now?

33:43.760 --> 33:46.981
I see that you're drunk and
you need to drink this water.

33:46.981 --> 33:49.679
Is that really all you see?

33:49.679 --> 33:51.725
Jet--

33:51.725 --> 33:54.336
Because that's not me at all
right now.

33:55.511 --> 33:58.036
And I'm not in love
with Seamus.

33:58.036 --> 33:59.602
What?

34:02.127 --> 34:03.780
What's going on?
- What's going on

34:03.780 --> 34:06.522
is I came here to show you
that I'm a good actress.

34:06.522 --> 34:10.396
And when it comes to O'Meara,
to doing my job,

34:10.396 --> 34:12.528
I know how to play a part.

34:12.528 --> 34:15.749
I know you think I kissed him
because I liked him,

34:15.749 --> 34:18.273
but the truth is
it was a tactical mistake,

34:18.273 --> 34:19.579
not an emotional one.

34:19.579 --> 34:21.102
Oh, so you admit
you made a mistake?

34:21.102 --> 34:22.451
Yes.

34:25.889 --> 34:28.240
And I'm sorry.

34:28.240 --> 34:31.721
I shouldn't have
crossed the line.

34:31.721 --> 34:34.594
I just wanted you
to be proud of me.

34:34.594 --> 34:37.031
I am proud of you.

34:41.296 --> 34:43.994
What you don't know

34:43.994 --> 34:47.998
is that Eamonn Murphy
killed my partner.

34:50.610 --> 34:53.917
It happened years ago,

34:53.917 --> 34:55.441
right when I got out
of the academy.

34:55.441 --> 34:59.880
I was around your age, actually.

34:59.880 --> 35:01.708
Jennings was...

35:03.188 --> 35:06.104
He was like my mentor.

35:08.367 --> 35:12.632
Anyway, Murphy got this guy,

35:12.632 --> 35:16.288
this career criminal,
to take the fall.

35:16.288 --> 35:18.464
But it was Murphy.

35:19.943 --> 35:21.684
I'm so sorry.

35:24.209 --> 35:26.994
The police ring.

35:26.994 --> 35:29.170
That was Jennings'?

35:29.170 --> 35:30.519
Yeah.

35:33.218 --> 35:36.699
Give me one more chance.

35:36.699 --> 35:41.356
I know I don't deserve it,

35:41.356 --> 35:44.490
but I won't let you down
this time.

35:44.490 --> 35:46.970
I am so close
to turning O'Meara.

35:46.970 --> 35:49.321
You know I can do it.

35:49.321 --> 35:51.801
Let me just try
one more time.

35:53.499 --> 35:55.805
Please.

36:10.472 --> 36:13.519
Great crowd, huh?

36:13.519 --> 36:16.217
Listen, you got what you need?
Anything I can get you?

36:16.217 --> 36:17.914
Fine for now.
Thank you.

36:30.318 --> 36:32.190
Still nothing from Jet.

36:32.190 --> 36:33.365
Don't worry.
She'll be here.

36:33.365 --> 36:34.888
Mm.

36:37.934 --> 36:40.415
That's a Morello.

36:40.415 --> 36:41.808
Jamie, we just had

36:41.808 --> 36:45.290
the head of the Morello
crime family walk in.

36:47.727 --> 36:49.250
<i>You got eyes on Teddy?</i>

36:49.250 --> 36:51.034
He's ready.

36:53.602 --> 36:56.301
- Fighters, ready?
- Oh, yeah.

36:58.825 --> 37:00.609
Let's fight!

37:00.609 --> 37:02.611
That's it.

37:08.313 --> 37:09.966
OK, send him in.

37:13.013 --> 37:14.493
Teddy's on the move.

37:20.542 --> 37:23.415
Use that jab like I told you.
Come on.

37:23.415 --> 37:25.330
Got that money
for those souvenirs.

37:25.330 --> 37:27.201
When the fight's over.

37:27.201 --> 37:30.073
Sure.
Just wanted you to know.

37:30.073 --> 37:31.423
- That's it!
- Come on!

37:31.423 --> 37:32.815
- Keep that elbow in.
- Come on!

37:32.815 --> 37:34.513
Good. Good.
- That's it.

37:55.229 --> 37:56.796
What is it?

37:58.493 --> 38:00.452
- Is that--
- Michael Amato.

38:04.499 --> 38:06.762
Eamonn Murphy!

38:18.557 --> 38:20.298
Gotta go.
Come on.

38:20.298 --> 38:22.387
Come on!

38:27.392 --> 38:28.828
Come on!
Hurry up!

38:30.960 --> 38:32.179
All right.
Get in the car.

38:32.179 --> 38:33.876
What is going on?

38:33.876 --> 38:36.357
Juliet, get in the damn car
or he's gonna kill you too!

38:36.357 --> 38:39.621
Seamus,
what the hell is going on?

38:39.621 --> 38:41.710
All right.
That guy back there, right?

38:41.710 --> 38:43.408
That was Michael Amato.

38:43.408 --> 38:45.410
The one
Murphy hired you to kill?

38:46.889 --> 38:49.936
I-I thought you were
gonna pay him off

38:49.936 --> 38:51.764
and tell him to get lost
so you didn't have to.

38:51.764 --> 38:54.549
I did.
I did, and that dumb son of a--

38:54.549 --> 38:56.595
Now Eamonn's gonna kill him,
and me, and you,

38:56.595 --> 38:58.423
just to prove a point.

39:00.773 --> 39:02.470
Baby, I'm so sorry. I didn't
mean for this to happen.

39:02.470 --> 39:03.602
I was trying to do
the right thing.

39:03.602 --> 39:05.778
Hey. Hey.

39:05.778 --> 39:07.519
You did do the right thing.

39:09.390 --> 39:10.391
You did.

39:12.698 --> 39:14.134
All right, we got to go.
Come on.

39:14.134 --> 39:16.179
Wait!

39:35.068 --> 39:36.983
Drop the gun.
Get on the ground.

39:40.073 --> 39:42.031
- What?
- My name isn't Juliet.

39:42.031 --> 39:43.685
It's Detective
Jet Slootmaekers,

39:43.685 --> 39:46.906
Organized Crime Task Force.

39:46.906 --> 39:48.864
What?

39:48.864 --> 39:51.214
You're not really a cop.
Come on.

39:51.214 --> 39:53.129
Drop the gun.

39:56.785 --> 39:58.178
Drop it!
- All right.

39:58.178 --> 40:00.180
All right.

40:04.314 --> 40:07.405
Hands on your head.

40:07.405 --> 40:10.451
I can't believe
you're doing this.

40:10.451 --> 40:11.887
You told me
to be honest with you.

40:11.887 --> 40:13.759
I-I was.

40:13.759 --> 40:15.195
All right?

40:15.195 --> 40:17.284
You said you were
gonna be honest too.

40:17.284 --> 40:19.765
I was just falling for you.

40:21.636 --> 40:24.596
You were falling for me,
weren't you?

40:24.596 --> 40:25.988
Or was that all a lie too?

40:25.988 --> 40:28.643
<i>Jet, where are you?
What's going on?</i>

40:36.259 --> 40:37.783
Stop!

40:40.220 --> 40:41.264
No!

41:11.860 --> 41:15.255
<i>Jet, are you there?
Hello?</i>

41:21.435 --> 41:21.827
<i>...</i>
