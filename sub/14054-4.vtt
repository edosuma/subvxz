00:02.440 --> 00:04.192
- <i>Previously on</i> The O.C.<i>:</i>
- She came back...

00:04.360 --> 00:05.634
...so I guess you're going home.

00:05.800 --> 00:08.029
- You're his mother.
- I'm a mess, not a mother. 

00:08.200 --> 00:11.749
- You can't walk away.
- This way he ends up with a real mom.

00:12.760 --> 00:14.716
It's sweet that
you're concerned about this boy...

00:14.880 --> 00:17.189
...but you need to focus on the future,
which means Luke.

00:17.360 --> 00:18.998
She chose you.
You're the one she wants.

00:19.160 --> 00:21.071
- I wanna sail to Tahiti.
- You're taking this to Tahiti?

00:21.240 --> 00:22.753
- How much do you need?
- It's $100,000.

00:22.920 --> 00:25.798
The check that you guys gave Jimmy.
We needed that 100 grand.

00:25.960 --> 00:27.916
- Ryan's gonna stay with us now.
- Awesome.

00:28.080 --> 00:30.355
We just got in way over our heads.

00:35.400 --> 00:38.073
- Oh, really? You think so?
- I do.

00:38.240 --> 00:39.798
We'll see about that, monkey pox.

00:42.480 --> 00:44.710
So the pupil has become the teacher.

00:44.880 --> 00:47.872
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

00:48.240 --> 00:49.389
Who died?

00:49.560 --> 00:51.915
Seth, we need to talk to Ryan.

00:52.520 --> 00:53.999
Okay.

00:54.160 --> 00:58.153
If this has to do with the rug, I want to
say that Ryan had nothing to do with it.

00:58.320 --> 00:59.719
What about the rug?

01:00.120 --> 01:01.678
I'm gonna go now.

01:06.640 --> 01:08.073
So...

01:09.480 --> 01:11.948
Kirsten and I went
to Child Services this morning...

01:12.120 --> 01:15.749
...and we told them
that we want you to stay with us.

01:17.200 --> 01:19.794
But there's a catch.
Because you're a minor...

01:19.960 --> 01:22.349
...the only way they're gonna
allow that to happen...

01:22.520 --> 01:25.637
...is if we assume
all legal responsibility for you.

01:27.200 --> 01:31.557
- I can't ask you guys to do that.
- You don't have to. We're asking you.

01:31.720 --> 01:35.315
We've all talked about it,
and we want to be your legal guardians.

01:36.040 --> 01:38.031
We want you to be part of the family.

01:38.560 --> 01:39.629
If you wanna be.

01:41.640 --> 01:42.914
What if it doesn't work?

01:44.000 --> 01:45.513
Well, how do you mean?

01:46.520 --> 01:49.671
What if something happens
and you guys change your mind?

01:49.840 --> 01:51.319
Like what?

01:51.480 --> 01:53.391
You steal a car?
You burn down a house?

01:53.560 --> 01:56.120
You beat up the captain
of the water polo team?

01:56.280 --> 01:58.191
Those ships have sailed, my friend.

01:58.360 --> 02:02.592
You have to promise us you'll stay out
of trouble. From now on, no more fights.

02:02.760 --> 02:08.152
You're still on probation, and Child
Services will be up our ass all the time.

02:09.600 --> 02:12.273
No more trouble. I promise.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.228
Well...

02:19.800 --> 02:23.315
- Welcome to the family.
- Thanks, guys.

02:28.640 --> 02:30.995
Okay, Seth. You can come out now.

02:35.720 --> 02:37.711
You knew about this
and didn't say anything.

02:37.880 --> 02:39.154
I didn't wanna jinx it.

02:39.680 --> 02:41.875
Dude, you're a Cohen now.

02:42.040 --> 02:45.191
Welcome to a life of insecurity
and paralyzing self-doubt.

02:45.360 --> 02:49.478
Yeah. Now all I have to do
is stay out of trouble.

02:50.840 --> 02:52.512
Yeah, that could be...

02:52.680 --> 02:54.033
...difficult.

02:56.000 --> 03:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:28.680 --> 03:32.309
You're gonna need
bedding and towels.

03:33.480 --> 03:36.074
How's the bed, Ryan?
Is it comfortable?

03:36.760 --> 03:38.034
Yeah, it's...

03:41.320 --> 03:43.311
It's fine. It's great.

03:44.280 --> 03:47.636
We want you to have your privacy,
but it's a pool house. It needs warmth.

03:47.800 --> 03:50.633
You'll need chairs and a desk,
a bookshelf...

03:50.800 --> 03:53.553
Plasma flat screen,
a couple of turntables, minibar.

03:53.760 --> 03:57.594
And we should clean all this out so that
you have room for some of your...

03:58.160 --> 04:02.233
Right, you don't have stuff, so we have
to buy clothes, shoes and underpants.

04:02.400 --> 04:04.391
Mom, don't say "underpants."

04:05.400 --> 04:07.118
I've got everything I need. Really.

04:07.280 --> 04:10.397
I bet you don't have a tux.
Because you're gonna need one.

04:11.040 --> 04:12.758
- For what?
- For cotillion.

04:12.920 --> 04:16.117
It's the annual debutante ball.
It's Newport's biggest event.

04:16.279 --> 04:17.553
Until whatever's next week.

04:17.720 --> 04:20.439
It's the day when Newport's
most accomplished young women...

04:20.600 --> 04:22.113
...make their debut into society.

04:22.280 --> 04:24.874
Or another excuse for them
to get wasted and throw up.

04:25.040 --> 04:28.794
I was a deb. I made my debut at this
very country club not so many years ago.

04:28.960 --> 04:31.713
- The year was...
- Hey, watch it.

04:34.560 --> 04:36.039
You know what?

04:37.480 --> 04:39.914
- Maybe I should skip it.
- You have to go.

04:40.080 --> 04:42.594
It's a family tradition.
And you're part of the family.

04:42.760 --> 04:44.910
- Hello, dear.
- Hi, Peggy.

04:45.080 --> 04:46.832
- How are you?
- I'm good.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.434
- How's it going?
- It will be fine.

04:49.600 --> 04:52.990
- The fitting area's back there.
- Thank you.

04:53.160 --> 04:55.196
Come on, boys. It'll be fun.

05:07.680 --> 05:09.113
Sandy.

05:09.280 --> 05:10.713
Hey, Jimmy.

05:11.840 --> 05:13.592
Got some surfing in, huh?

05:13.760 --> 05:16.558
Late court date. Gotta take advantage.

05:16.720 --> 05:18.711
I used to have hobbies.

05:18.880 --> 05:21.838
Look, I know you're not thrilled
with me.

05:22.000 --> 05:26.073
When I borrowed the money from
Kirsten, I should have asked you.

05:26.240 --> 05:29.471
- I wasn't going behind your back.
- Look, it's done. Let's move on.

05:29.640 --> 05:32.029
I was afraid of what you'd think of me.

05:33.440 --> 05:35.032
Losing as much money as I have...

05:36.760 --> 05:38.876
...is not an impressive accomplishment.

05:40.360 --> 05:42.191
- How much money did you lose?
- Look...

05:42.480 --> 05:43.595
It's not important.

05:45.760 --> 05:47.830
- How'd you lose it?
- The important thing is...

05:48.000 --> 05:52.630
...I don't know what Julie and I would
do without friends like you and Kirsten.

05:54.720 --> 05:55.914
So everything's okay?

05:56.080 --> 05:58.594
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Thank you.

05:58.760 --> 06:00.910
- I'll see you around.
- See you.

06:05.000 --> 06:09.676
Okay, pick whatever you want.
We have Gucci, Armani. Versace's there.

06:15.760 --> 06:18.433
Hi, I'm picking up for Marissa Cooper.

06:18.600 --> 06:20.989
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:21.800 --> 06:23.358
What are you doing here?

06:23.520 --> 06:24.999
I...

06:25.160 --> 06:27.276
...had an appointment
with my personal shopper.

06:28.640 --> 06:31.313
But I thought you said
you were leaving with your mom.

06:32.040 --> 06:36.113
It didn't really work out,
so I'm kind of living with the Cohens.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.309
- For good?
- Is that...

06:39.480 --> 06:41.835
...gonna be a problem?
- No, no. It's great.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.036
I mean, I guess now
we can be friends, right?

06:46.080 --> 06:47.354
Hey, Coop.

06:47.520 --> 06:50.478
These gloves are giving me
serious sausage arms.

06:50.640 --> 06:53.712
What are you still doing here?
I thought you were going back to Chino.

06:53.880 --> 06:56.348
- I had a change of plans.
- Ryan's living here now.

06:57.320 --> 06:59.595
- He's what?
- Look, I'm not here to cause problems.

06:59.760 --> 07:01.159
Is everything all right?

07:03.320 --> 07:05.038
- I'll be in the truck.
- Great.

07:05.920 --> 07:09.071
Marissa, I was gonna call you.
Since you're lead deb...

07:09.240 --> 07:10.798
Seth?

07:10.960 --> 07:13.474
I wanted to introduce you
to a couple of white knights.

07:13.640 --> 07:16.074
In case any of your girls
needed a last-minute escort.

07:16.240 --> 07:18.674
- Okay.
- Every girl needs a white knight.

07:19.960 --> 07:22.235
Seth Cohen, white knight.

07:23.880 --> 07:26.519
So you'll be at the rehearsal?

07:26.680 --> 07:28.432
Yes, absolutely.

07:29.400 --> 07:31.038
See you then.

07:32.040 --> 07:33.439
Bye.

07:33.600 --> 07:35.670
Cotillion rocks.

07:36.320 --> 07:40.233
You want me to fix you up with Ryan?
I thought you said he was a "psycho."

07:40.400 --> 07:43.278
- That was before I got to know him.
- When did you get to know him?

07:43.440 --> 07:44.589
Just now.

07:44.760 --> 07:46.876
Plus there's that
whole brooding bad-boy thing.

07:47.040 --> 07:49.110
He's wounded. I can save him.

07:49.280 --> 07:52.511
Have you ever really talked to him?
He's not really a bad boy.

07:52.680 --> 07:55.194
Well, he will be by the time
I get through with him.

07:58.720 --> 08:02.395
What? You're not, like,
into him, are you?

08:02.560 --> 08:04.915
- I mean, you're with Luke, right?
- Right.

08:05.080 --> 08:06.399
Good.

08:09.600 --> 08:11.272
Sandy Cohen?

08:11.440 --> 08:15.274
I'm with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, Enforcement Division.

08:16.360 --> 08:17.793
Okay.

08:17.960 --> 08:20.315
I was hoping you could help me out
with a case.

08:20.840 --> 08:23.035
Sure. What can I do for you?

08:23.400 --> 08:26.392
Were you aware, Mr. Cohen,
that a check your wife made out...

08:26.560 --> 08:30.712
...to a James Cooper for $100,000
was not treated as an investment...

08:30.880 --> 08:33.110
...but as a deposit
into his personal account?

08:33.280 --> 08:37.239
It wasn't an investment. It was a loan.
My wife and Jimmy are old...

08:38.400 --> 08:40.674
- What's this about?
- Did you know Mr. Cooper is...

08:40.840 --> 08:43.308
...the subject of an
SEC fraud investigation?

08:44.440 --> 08:45.873
No.

08:47.120 --> 08:48.599
No, I didn't.

08:51.080 --> 08:54.277
Hey. White gloves,
ready for a comeback.

08:54.440 --> 08:56.635
Hey. What are you doing home?

08:58.600 --> 09:00.511
Fellas, do you mind?

09:01.760 --> 09:04.513
- Lf this is about the vase...
- Which vase?

09:05.160 --> 09:08.789
Nothing. Let's go, Ryan.
Come on, buddy.

09:14.880 --> 09:16.074
What's going on?

09:18.240 --> 09:20.470
Okay. So...

09:20.800 --> 09:22.791
I think I'm not going to cotillion.

09:22.960 --> 09:24.678
Yeah, okay. Except that you are.

09:24.840 --> 09:27.877
I made a promise to your parents
that I'd stay out of trouble.

09:28.040 --> 09:30.429
It's a debutante ball.
What trouble can you get into?

09:30.600 --> 09:31.953
Why don't you ask Luke.

09:32.520 --> 09:34.670
Ryan, we're white knights, okay?

09:34.840 --> 09:37.877
That means Marissa probably
already has some sad, Ionely girl...

09:38.040 --> 09:41.237
...lined up for you to escort,
so you can't cancel at the last minute.

09:41.400 --> 09:43.038
That's a faux pas, buddy.

09:45.960 --> 09:48.474
- Would you call her?
- No.

09:49.640 --> 09:53.918
If you're gonna bail on Marissa and some
poor, pathetic, dateless girl...

09:54.080 --> 09:56.310
...you'll just have to
do that one yourself.

09:56.840 --> 09:58.273
Are you sure?

09:58.440 --> 10:01.876
These guys say Jimmy's been siphoning
money out of his clients' accounts...

10:02.040 --> 10:03.837
...to cover his own debts.

10:05.440 --> 10:09.274
- How could we not know this?
- Because we trusted him. Everybody did.

10:09.440 --> 10:12.796
This entire community wrote him blank
checks. You gave him 100 grand.

10:12.960 --> 10:14.188
It was just a loan.

10:14.360 --> 10:17.591
Which, according to the SEC,
makes us worth investigating too.

10:17.760 --> 10:19.671
I'm gonna be sick.

10:22.880 --> 10:25.155
I'm gonna have to call our friends
and let them know.

10:25.320 --> 10:28.551
Sandy, wait.
You're just gonna panic people.

10:28.720 --> 10:31.029
Don't do anything
until I talk to him, okay?

10:31.200 --> 10:33.873
Put your feelings for him aside.
Forget about your history.

10:34.040 --> 10:36.190
He's one of my oldest friends.

10:38.840 --> 10:41.400
If it's true, I just need
to hear it from him.

10:43.880 --> 10:45.074
<i>I'm coming.</i>

10:47.080 --> 10:49.355
Hey. You're...

10:49.520 --> 10:51.112
...at my house.
- I...

10:51.280 --> 10:53.794
Well, I wanted to talk to you
about cotillion.

10:53.960 --> 10:55.678
Oh. Okay, well...

10:55.840 --> 10:59.992
I was just trying this on,
and I can't seem to reach the...

11:00.160 --> 11:01.479
Did you want me to...?

11:02.560 --> 11:04.312
I could... Do you want me to...?

11:04.760 --> 11:08.070
Yeah. You know, actually,
if you wouldn't mind.

11:32.240 --> 11:33.753
Thanks.

11:34.440 --> 11:36.317
So, what's up with cotillion?

11:37.760 --> 11:39.876
What time did you want me there?

11:44.560 --> 11:46.596
I'm... I'm so sorry.

11:46.760 --> 11:49.513
I never meant for you
to be dragged in like this.

11:49.680 --> 11:54.390
How did this happen? I understand
a couple of bad investments, but theft?

11:54.560 --> 11:57.028
- Theft? No, no.
- Okay, honey, so we're gonna...

11:57.200 --> 11:58.918
- Oh, Kirsten.
- Julie.

11:59.360 --> 12:03.672
- Jimmy didn't say you were coming by.
- She just had a quick business question.

12:03.840 --> 12:06.115
- A quickie, huh?
- Julie.

12:06.280 --> 12:09.590
I'm kidding. So we're off.
Kaitlin needs new shoes for cotillion.

12:09.760 --> 12:13.275
Then we're test-driving the CLK, then I
have to re-up Marissa's tennis lessons.

12:13.440 --> 12:15.795
- So which credit card should I use?
- The MasterCard.

12:15.960 --> 12:19.316
- What about the Amex?
- No, don't use the Amex. The...

12:19.480 --> 12:20.833
Get the miles.

12:22.120 --> 12:23.519
Okay.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.513
You two have fun.

12:27.640 --> 12:31.679
Well, now that the how and why
have been accounted for...

12:31.840 --> 12:36.868
Look, I was not stealing.
I was borrowing to pay back my debts.

12:37.040 --> 12:39.349
And then the market took a turn,
and there we are.

12:39.520 --> 12:40.999
You were stealing.

12:41.160 --> 12:46.518
I... I can't say no to my family.
I'll pay everything back.

12:46.680 --> 12:49.956
- I just need that one stock. That one.
- Jimmy, you need help.

12:55.400 --> 12:57.595
Yeah, well, who's gonna help me?

13:02.400 --> 13:05.312
So, what exactly happens
at this rehearsal?

13:05.480 --> 13:07.630
Just stupid cotillion stuff.

13:07.800 --> 13:10.314
Bowing and curtsying.

13:10.480 --> 13:13.870
One, two, three. One, two, three.

13:14.040 --> 13:17.237
Try to enjoy this, please.

13:17.400 --> 13:19.755
Dancing? You didn't tell me
there was dancing.

13:19.920 --> 13:22.832
Well, if I'd told you there was dancing,
I'd be here by myself.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.479
Because I really...

13:24.640 --> 13:26.039
...don't dance.

13:26.200 --> 13:28.191
Neither do I. I just move well.

13:31.040 --> 13:33.110
Want me to teach you that one?

13:34.160 --> 13:37.038
- Maybe later. You ready?
- Take your places.

13:38.400 --> 13:41.437
Hey, guys.
So can I introduce you to your debs?

13:41.600 --> 13:43.238
We've already met.

13:43.560 --> 13:47.030
Oh, well, actually, Summer, Ryan's
already been promised to someone else.

13:47.200 --> 13:49.077
You gave him to someone else?

13:49.240 --> 13:53.074
Who? Who's pathetic enough not
to have a date the day before cotillion?

13:53.240 --> 13:56.198
Actually, at this point,
that would be you.

13:56.360 --> 14:00.319
So, Anna Stern, this is Ryan Atwood.
Anna just moved here from Pittsburgh.

14:00.480 --> 14:02.072
Pittsburgh?

14:03.080 --> 14:05.389
Can we just get this over with?

14:08.000 --> 14:09.752
<i>Caliente.</i>

14:11.720 --> 14:14.837
- Hey, it's not that bad.
- You haven't seen me dance.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.752
Well, I can help you.

14:16.920 --> 14:19.480
So, like, what am I supposed to do?

14:19.640 --> 14:21.392
Over here.

14:23.200 --> 14:24.679
Fine. Let's go.

14:24.840 --> 14:26.910
Are you sure? Because if you're not...

14:27.080 --> 14:29.594
Just don't talk to me.

14:29.760 --> 14:33.116
All right, I get it. Our...
Our connection's deeper than words.

14:35.800 --> 14:38.951
That's it. I'm done. I'm sorry.
Chock-full of quiet now.

14:42.520 --> 14:44.511
Okay. So you guys will be over here.

14:44.680 --> 14:47.148
If you want to,
go ahead and get into waltz position.

14:49.200 --> 14:52.636
Which means, Anna, you put
your left hand on Ryan's shoulder.

14:54.680 --> 14:57.069
No, not like that. Here, watch.

14:59.200 --> 15:02.715
Okay? Now, Ryan, you put
your right hand on my back.

15:03.280 --> 15:04.952
Lower.

15:24.320 --> 15:26.231
Okay. Good.

15:26.720 --> 15:27.914
Good.

15:28.080 --> 15:29.718
I'd be pretty jealous right now...

15:31.000 --> 15:32.479
...if Chino wasn't gay.

15:33.320 --> 15:35.072
- Luke.
- What? No, it doesn't bother me.

15:35.240 --> 15:36.514
He was born that way, right?

15:36.680 --> 15:38.716
Thanks. I think
we can take it from here.

15:38.880 --> 15:40.552
Okay.

15:44.720 --> 15:45.835
You're into her, huh?

15:47.320 --> 15:49.117
Man, are you in trouble.

15:49.840 --> 15:51.398
- I know.
- Yeah.

15:51.560 --> 15:52.959
- Yeah.
- Come on.

15:57.520 --> 15:59.431
All right, darlings, listen up.

15:59.600 --> 16:03.036
Let's review the classic waltz step.
Phillip?

16:03.840 --> 16:05.273
And...

16:05.440 --> 16:06.793
One, two, three.

16:06.960 --> 16:08.313
One, two, three.

16:08.480 --> 16:10.038
One, two, three.

16:10.200 --> 16:12.270
One, two, three. Smile, please.

16:12.440 --> 16:16.319
- That kid is stalking you.
- He is not. He's my neighbor.

16:16.480 --> 16:18.675
And he's not going anywhere,
so get used to him.

16:18.840 --> 16:23.356
What I'll never get used to is that kid
macking on you when I turn my back.

16:23.520 --> 16:25.670
So you don't trust me?

16:26.560 --> 16:28.118
No, I...

16:29.400 --> 16:33.359
I don't trust anybody else.
Not around you.

16:38.680 --> 16:40.557
- Wait.
- Slow down.

16:40.720 --> 16:43.188
Are you the kid from Chino
who steals cars...

16:43.360 --> 16:45.669
...and sets people's houses on fire?

16:47.640 --> 16:51.679
You're saying I'm making my debut into
society with Newport's most wanted?

16:51.840 --> 16:54.149
- Is that gonna be a problem?
- I can't wait.

16:57.960 --> 16:59.837
Absolutely not.

17:00.000 --> 17:04.278
As happy as I am that you came all
the way out to my office to visit me...

17:05.359 --> 17:06.395
...the answer is no.

17:06.560 --> 17:10.394
Corey! I need that file
on <i>Nerodner v. Caplin.</i>

17:10.560 --> 17:13.154
- And I need the INS report on my 4:30.
- Yes, sir.

17:13.319 --> 17:16.073
I got a two-time drug offender
they want to deport. 15 years old.

17:16.240 --> 17:17.832
Sandy, he needs help.

17:18.000 --> 17:21.196
Jimmy Cooper? He stole from his clients,
he stole from his friends...

17:21.359 --> 17:25.433
...and then he had the nerve to borrow
$100,000 from us to cover it up.

17:25.599 --> 17:27.909
He was trying to provide for his family.

17:28.079 --> 17:29.479
Yeah. Boats, ponies...

17:29.640 --> 17:32.108
- You'll defend a drug offender, but...?
- Yes.

17:32.480 --> 17:36.792
My clients are kids who have
no hope, no guidance, nothing.

17:36.960 --> 17:40.396
Jimmy Cooper is just another
spoiled Newport brat...

17:40.560 --> 17:42.198
...who had everything handed to him.

17:42.360 --> 17:44.635
- Like me.
- No. Not like you.

17:44.800 --> 17:47.792
You would never lie.
You would never steal.

17:47.960 --> 17:50.030
I'd like to think that, but the truth is...

17:50.200 --> 17:53.078
...there isn't anything
that I wouldn't do for my family.

17:53.600 --> 17:55.158
See you at home.

18:00.200 --> 18:03.431
- Three hours of dancing.
- I feel like I could go for three more.

18:03.600 --> 18:05.477
Ryan. So Anna seemed nice.

18:05.640 --> 18:08.154
I mean, I just figured she's new
and you're new, so...

18:08.320 --> 18:12.074
- Yeah.
- Great. Good.

18:12.840 --> 18:15.434
Holl, I was about to tell them
about the cookout tonight.

18:15.600 --> 18:17.955
It's at my house.
I do it every year for cotillion.

18:18.120 --> 18:20.714
- You didn't do it last year.
- Yeah, we did.

18:22.720 --> 18:23.709
Ouch.

18:23.880 --> 18:25.108
- See you tonight.
- Bye.

18:25.280 --> 18:26.599
See you there.

18:26.760 --> 18:28.955
You really think
that's such a great idea?

18:30.360 --> 18:31.679
Yeah, I do.

18:31.840 --> 18:35.913
You're living here now, and there's no
reason why we all can't hang out, right?

18:38.400 --> 18:41.073
- I can think of a reason.
- Yeah. I'm not going.

18:41.240 --> 18:43.470
- I don't want to go alone.
- Summer will be there.

18:43.640 --> 18:47.030
Yeah, I'm still going. I would just prefer
not to go alone. Listen to me.

18:47.200 --> 18:51.034
We're like brothers now, okay?
That means we do stuff for each other.

18:51.200 --> 18:54.749
If you do this for me, later on
I'll be able to do something for you.

18:54.920 --> 18:58.276
I don't know what it's going to be yet,
but it's gonna be awesome.

18:58.640 --> 18:59.629
Please?

18:59.800 --> 19:02.758
Okay, here we are.
Thank you very much. Okay.

19:02.920 --> 19:06.276
Here we go, sweetheart.
Make sure we got everything.

19:06.440 --> 19:09.750
Hey, Jimmy Cooper.
Just the man I wanted to see.

19:09.920 --> 19:12.150
- Hey, Greg. Hey, Holly.
- Hey, Mr. Cooper.

19:12.320 --> 19:13.514
Somebody's having a party.

19:13.680 --> 19:16.319
Holly's hosting this thing for the debs
out at the beach house.

19:16.480 --> 19:19.278
That's right. Marissa's going.
Have a good time.

19:19.440 --> 19:22.238
Honey, take these down to the car.
I'll be right there. Okay?

19:22.400 --> 19:24.994
Hi, I'm picking up for Cooper.

19:25.160 --> 19:28.357
Listen, Jimmy. I haven't heard back
from you. Did you get my messages?

19:28.520 --> 19:29.589
Yeah, I'm sorry.

19:29.760 --> 19:32.991
You know, work has been so crazy.
But what's going on?

19:33.160 --> 19:36.038
I've been asked to invest
in a commercial real-estate property.

19:36.200 --> 19:38.077
It could be a nice second income for us.

19:38.240 --> 19:41.596
It might be our only income, the way
the pharmaceutical industry's going.

19:41.760 --> 19:44.149
- That sounds promising.
- Yeah.

19:44.320 --> 19:48.393
So we're gonna have to pull $250,000
out of the investment account.

19:50.720 --> 19:54.235
Are you sure you wanna do that,
with the market about to turn around?

19:54.400 --> 19:58.632
Sir? I'm sorry,
but your credit card's been declined.

20:01.760 --> 20:05.469
Oh, it's a new card,
and I forgot to activate it.

20:05.640 --> 20:07.471
Did you want to use another card?

20:08.400 --> 20:10.231
Dad, I'm gonna be late
to my own party.

20:10.400 --> 20:11.594
Okay, honey.

20:11.760 --> 20:15.639
I'll call you tomorrow about the details.
Just bring the check to the cotillion.

20:15.800 --> 20:17.279
Enjoy your meal.

20:21.480 --> 20:23.835
I'll just pay with cash.

20:28.800 --> 20:31.030
Give me 10 minutes to find Summer,
lock it down for tomorrow.

20:31.200 --> 20:32.315
See where the night takes me.

20:32.480 --> 20:35.074
- Better take you back here in 10 minutes.
- Don't wait up.

20:35.240 --> 20:38.437
Come on. Two Jack Johnson tickets,
a massage at Burke Williams...

20:38.600 --> 20:42.832
...and all the money I have on me,
which is $11.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.355
Sorry, Summer,
I don't want to trade escorts.

20:46.400 --> 20:49.472
- Hey, Summer.
- What did I say about talking to me?

20:49.640 --> 20:54.555
Okay. I just wanted to make sure
we're still on for tomorrow night.

20:54.720 --> 20:56.199
I guess.

20:56.360 --> 20:59.670
Could you even pretend
to be a little bit stoked?

21:00.480 --> 21:02.118
Fair enough.

21:02.280 --> 21:05.556
You're a really good barbecue-tionist.

21:11.120 --> 21:12.599
There it is.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.672
Oh, jeez!

21:19.320 --> 21:22.073
You lost a bet. You lost a bet.
You've got to pay up.

21:33.800 --> 21:35.518
You sure you want to be seen with me?

21:35.680 --> 21:40.196
Hey, I'm glad you came. I mean,
how could you possibly miss all this?

21:43.840 --> 21:47.037
- I'm gonna go.
- Hey, we're not doing anything wrong.

21:47.200 --> 21:50.909
Well, now that you've moved in, I see
you're making yourself right at home.

21:51.080 --> 21:53.116
Luke, come on.
You said you were gonna try.

21:53.280 --> 21:57.432
I'm trying. I'm trying to understand
why there's all these people here...

21:57.600 --> 22:01.115
...and you only want to talk to her.
- Hey, I wanted to talk to him.

22:01.280 --> 22:04.716
Look, babe, why don't you go talk
to Summer, all right? She looks Ionely.

22:04.880 --> 22:07.348
Or you can,
and I'll finish talking to Ryan.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.150
No, it's okay. I'm just gonna go.

22:11.320 --> 22:13.788
- No. Stay.
- What are you doing? Don't tell him that.

22:13.960 --> 22:17.270
- Don't tell her what to do.
- I thought you were leaving.

22:17.440 --> 22:19.351
Why don't I just help you out.

22:22.880 --> 22:24.279
I'm not gonna fight.

22:26.920 --> 22:29.150
- Even if I do this?
- Luke!

22:30.200 --> 22:32.031
Oh, God. Are you okay?

22:33.600 --> 22:35.830
God, Luke, you're such an idiot.

22:37.080 --> 22:41.596
You just got your butt kicked and didn't
fight back. Dude, you really are a Cohen.

22:41.760 --> 22:43.352
Yeah. Let's get you home.

22:55.600 --> 22:57.830
What are you doing?
Why aren't you dressed yet?

22:58.000 --> 23:01.231
I'm not going. Would you let Anna know?
She'll probably be relieved.

23:01.400 --> 23:03.595
Are you not going
because you're afraid of Luke?

23:03.760 --> 23:05.955
That's not what I'm afraid of.

23:07.560 --> 23:11.872
Look, your parents taking me in is the
greatest thing that's happened to me.

23:12.040 --> 23:14.793
I'm not gonna lose it
just to kick some guy's ass.

23:15.960 --> 23:18.474
- You could totally kick his ass, right?
- Oh, yeah.

23:18.640 --> 23:20.039
Cool.

23:21.640 --> 23:23.915
All right. Well...

23:25.240 --> 23:26.753
...have fun.

23:30.680 --> 23:33.433
Sweetie, I need to borrow
your lip gloss.

23:33.600 --> 23:36.239
Oh, I love this dress.

23:36.400 --> 23:38.789
Really? Maybe you should wear it.

23:38.960 --> 23:43.317
You're sweet, but I think we both know
I'm no longer a size 0.

23:43.480 --> 23:45.789
Give me a few more months
on the Zone.

23:45.960 --> 23:48.076
I don't think I want to go.

23:48.240 --> 23:51.789
I'm sorry, I thought I heard you say you
don't want to go to your own cotillion.

23:51.960 --> 23:54.428
Look, Luke and I
got in a fight last night, okay?

23:54.600 --> 23:56.909
So you got into a fight.
You've had fights before.

23:57.080 --> 23:58.798
You guys have been together forever.

23:58.960 --> 24:01.315
Maybe that's the problem.

24:02.600 --> 24:05.751
I mean, what if
there's someone else out there?

24:05.920 --> 24:08.036
Like who? That boy from Chino?

24:11.520 --> 24:15.354
Do you want to end up like Aunt Cindy,
with four kids in a trailer park?

24:15.520 --> 24:17.317
She broke my mom's heart.
You won't break mine.

24:17.480 --> 24:20.597
- So now this is about you?
- No, sweetie, it's about you.

24:20.760 --> 24:23.797
- What future is there with that boy?
- Mom, I'm 16.

24:23.960 --> 24:27.475
The choices you make when you're 16
can affect your entire future.

24:27.640 --> 24:31.997
Luke is from a good family. If you stay
with him, you'll always be comfortable.

24:32.160 --> 24:35.789
- I'm comfortable now.
- Nothing in life is certain.

24:37.200 --> 24:39.919
- What does that mean?
- It means you'll put on this dress...

24:40.080 --> 24:44.198
...do your hair like I showed you and
make your debut into society with Luke.

24:44.360 --> 24:45.679
I can't.

24:48.240 --> 24:49.639
I'm sorry.

24:50.720 --> 24:51.789
No, you're not.

24:53.160 --> 24:55.310
But you will be.

25:02.120 --> 25:04.350
What are you doing?
Why aren't you dressed?

25:04.520 --> 25:06.909
- I'm not going.
- What do you mean, you're not going?

25:07.080 --> 25:08.911
I don't feel like getting dressed up...

25:09.080 --> 25:11.594
...and pretending Jimmy Cooper
is the O.C. Golden boy.

25:12.360 --> 25:16.194
And any community that makes that guy
a hero is not one I feel like being part of.

25:17.040 --> 25:18.189
You're not going either?

25:18.360 --> 25:21.079
- I wanted to leave 20 minutes ago.
- Let's go.

25:21.240 --> 25:24.038
- Dad, why aren't you...?
- Seth. Now.

25:26.640 --> 25:29.313
I don't know.
Maybe I shouldn't go either.

25:29.480 --> 25:32.677
What? What is wrong with this family?

25:32.840 --> 25:36.037
This is cotillion, the most
important event of the year.

25:36.200 --> 25:37.952
Am I the only one who gets it?

25:38.120 --> 25:39.872
I get it, Mommy.

25:40.040 --> 25:42.873
Daddy, it's Mr. Fisher again.
He's called, like, three times.

25:43.040 --> 25:46.157
No. We do not have time
for you two to talk business.

25:46.320 --> 25:50.074
Tell Greg Daddy will see him
at the cotillion. Right, Jimmy?

25:51.920 --> 25:53.990
All right.

25:54.160 --> 25:56.549
Come on. We don't wanna be late.

26:01.800 --> 26:03.711
You guys know Anna Stern?

26:03.880 --> 26:05.313
Seth.

26:07.120 --> 26:08.235
Wow.

26:09.720 --> 26:12.553
- You think?
- Yes...

26:12.720 --> 26:16.679
...I do. Which makes this
even harder to say.

26:16.840 --> 26:21.356
Anna, just know that, in life,
there are peaks and...

26:21.520 --> 26:23.033
Ryan's not coming, is he?

26:23.200 --> 26:25.998
Kind of took the wind
out of my sails there, but yes.

26:27.640 --> 26:30.279
- Are you okay?
- I'll survive.

26:39.280 --> 26:41.874
- Hey.
- Hey.

26:42.480 --> 26:44.710
- Thought you were going to cotillion.
- I thought you were.

26:44.880 --> 26:47.633
Yeah. No.

26:48.840 --> 26:50.831
Yeah, me neither.

26:51.600 --> 26:54.433
- Which one's sword?
- Not the one you're hitting.

26:54.600 --> 26:57.319
- Got it.
- Okay, now you're stabbing me.

26:57.480 --> 27:00.790
Just don't touch any of the buttons.
Follow me through the forest...

27:00.960 --> 27:03.713
...and maybe we'll both make it
out of here alive.

27:05.360 --> 27:07.715
So you didn't feel like going, huh?

27:07.880 --> 27:10.678
Yeah. No, not really for me.

27:10.840 --> 27:14.116
What? Waltzing and orchids?
What could be more you?

27:14.280 --> 27:16.191
Guess I don't really fit in, huh?

27:16.360 --> 27:18.590
Oh, I got news for you. Nobody does.

27:19.720 --> 27:23.508
I guarantee you every single person
at that cotillion feels like a fraud.

27:23.680 --> 27:27.389
They've all got secrets, and they're all
terrified the neighbors will find out.

27:28.240 --> 27:29.958
What's your secret?

27:31.040 --> 27:36.239
Sometimes, when the sun's
coming up and the surf is good...

27:36.400 --> 27:40.393
...and I haven't pissed my wife off
quite as much as I have today...

27:41.440 --> 27:43.237
...I kind of like this place.

27:44.920 --> 27:46.592
You just stabbed me again.

27:47.560 --> 27:48.788
Sorry.

27:48.960 --> 27:50.473
I can't believe you're not coming.

27:50.640 --> 27:55.236
It's just after the whole Luke and Ryan
thing last night, I don't feel...

27:55.400 --> 27:56.753
Coop...

27:56.920 --> 27:58.194
...Ryan isn't even here.

27:58.520 --> 27:59.873
He's not?

28:00.840 --> 28:03.070
Yeah, well, even so.

28:03.720 --> 28:05.039
I'm just not up for it.

28:07.920 --> 28:09.558
She's not coming.

28:10.920 --> 28:12.990
So, what did I get all dressed up for?

28:24.920 --> 28:28.117
I mean, whatever you think about
the whole superhero movie genre...

28:28.280 --> 28:30.794
...at least people are now reading
the source material.

28:30.960 --> 28:35.476
I cannot believe that you read
comic books. I mean, you're a girl.

28:35.640 --> 28:38.518
What's that supposed to mean?
And I call them "graphic novels."

28:38.680 --> 28:42.116
In fact, if more people did, maybe
the form wouldn't be so marginalized.

28:42.280 --> 28:44.191
I couldn't agree more.

28:45.680 --> 28:48.672
Summer, are you ready?
You look just great.

28:48.840 --> 28:50.319
So listen...

28:55.840 --> 28:57.432
You...

28:58.080 --> 28:59.832
...found another date.
- Yeah.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.912
It's kind of an emergency,
but you're off the hook.

29:04.120 --> 29:06.714
- Sorry.
- No, that's...

29:10.680 --> 29:12.352
That's fine.

29:26.720 --> 29:29.029
- Hey.
- Hey.

29:30.960 --> 29:32.188
You're not at cotillion.

29:32.960 --> 29:34.188
Neither are you.

29:37.520 --> 29:40.990
Look, I hope you didn't not go
because of last night or...

29:41.400 --> 29:42.913
...because of me.

29:45.280 --> 29:46.633
How come you're not going?

29:50.280 --> 29:53.477
So you think hiding out, staying home
is gonna make everything better?

29:54.160 --> 29:56.435
Seems to be working for you.

29:59.480 --> 30:01.675
I'll go if you go.

30:03.400 --> 30:07.234
Ryan, come on. Check this out. I have
totally annihilated all the other ninjas.

30:07.400 --> 30:09.152
I'm already on to the...

30:09.640 --> 30:11.278
Marissa. Hello.

30:11.720 --> 30:13.199
Hey.

30:13.960 --> 30:15.598
So we're gonna go.

30:16.600 --> 30:17.794
To cotillion.

30:21.720 --> 30:22.789
I'll get the car.

30:27.720 --> 30:30.075
Hey, Jimmy, there you are.

30:30.240 --> 30:33.312
- Greg, how you doing?
- I'll be better once I get that check...

30:33.480 --> 30:36.313
...get this property deal closed,
get my wife off my back.

30:36.480 --> 30:39.597
- I don't have it.
- What do you mean? Did you forget it?

30:39.760 --> 30:43.594
This isn't the time or place. Stop by the
office tomorrow, and we'll talk about it.

30:43.760 --> 30:45.830
Talk about it? Talk about what?

30:52.400 --> 30:55.153
- Excuse me.
- Jimmy...

30:57.800 --> 30:59.870
I don't believe it.

31:04.560 --> 31:07.791
You told Summer you weren't coming.
Now you're here with him?

31:07.960 --> 31:10.349
- Ryan and I aren't here together.
- I'm not an idiot.

31:10.520 --> 31:12.511
Then listen to her
and stop acting like one.

31:12.680 --> 31:14.272
What did you say?

31:14.800 --> 31:17.712
- Forget it.
- No, what did you say? Come on, man.

31:17.880 --> 31:19.393
Luke, stop it.

31:22.840 --> 31:25.400
I'm over this. We're done.

31:43.880 --> 31:46.678
Hey, look who decided to show up.

31:46.840 --> 31:50.196
Don't worry, your hit man already
took care of it. I didn't feel a thing.

31:50.760 --> 31:52.239
I'm here now, if you want to...

31:52.840 --> 31:55.434
No, too late. You missed your shot.

31:55.600 --> 31:59.195
I guess you'll have to go
with Princess Mononoke over there.

32:00.440 --> 32:04.035
- And what are you gonna do?
- Oh, so now you care? Go.

32:05.800 --> 32:09.315
Marissa, if you'd just stuck
to the original plan...

32:10.400 --> 32:13.119
- Sorry. Do you want Daddy to go find...?
- No, Mom.

32:13.280 --> 32:17.034
- You can't debut without an escort.
- I hear there's a white knight available.

32:19.600 --> 32:23.513
Well, that's very nice of you to offer,
but I don't think it's appropriate.

32:23.680 --> 32:25.272
I'll go get dressed.

32:33.400 --> 32:35.436
Could you be any more pathetic?

32:35.840 --> 32:37.990
A Ione figure sitting on the floor...

32:38.160 --> 32:41.072
...wondering if he'll be Ionely
for the rest of his life.

32:41.640 --> 32:44.200
Hey, your sensitivity, it's really...

32:44.360 --> 32:47.750
...nonexistent.
- You know what your problem is?

32:48.840 --> 32:50.956
You're not a man.

32:51.120 --> 32:53.031
Again, not appreciating
the brutal honesty.

32:53.200 --> 32:54.952
Do you know what girls find sexy?

32:55.120 --> 32:57.554
Nope. Wait, let me guess.

32:57.720 --> 33:01.998
- Dudes who play water polo.
- Confidence. Watch this.

33:03.520 --> 33:05.909
- Seth?
- Yes?

33:06.080 --> 33:08.594
I don't have a date to the cotillion.

33:09.120 --> 33:10.917
Would you be my escort?

33:12.560 --> 33:14.278
I mean...

33:14.440 --> 33:16.954
Confidence, Cohen.

33:18.800 --> 33:20.870
Let's do this.

33:21.040 --> 33:25.795
Hair's good, makeup's good. Very nice.
Stand up straight. Gum, please.

33:25.960 --> 33:26.949
How did this happen?

33:27.120 --> 33:30.317
How did I go from having three dates
to cotillion to having none?

33:30.480 --> 33:32.835
I'm sorry, girl. That blows.

33:36.360 --> 33:38.157
Good news. I'm available again.

33:38.600 --> 33:40.113
You are?

33:42.960 --> 33:46.077
No. No. We're gonna go this way. No.

33:57.000 --> 34:00.072
Five hundred channels and nothing on.

34:01.080 --> 34:03.275
You couldn't put on a tux?

34:03.440 --> 34:05.829
Pick your battles, honey.

34:06.480 --> 34:08.357
Good evening, everyone.

34:08.520 --> 34:14.469
And welcome to the 47th annual
Newport Beach Debutante Cotillion.

34:22.480 --> 34:23.754
Hey.

34:26.080 --> 34:27.991
Are you ready to make your debut?

34:33.760 --> 34:37.878
Holly Fisher,
daughter of Greg and Marianne Fisher.

34:47.560 --> 34:51.951
Anna Stern,
daughter of Cameron and Patricia Stern.

35:05.960 --> 35:10.272
Marissa Cooper,
daughter of James and Julie Cooper.

35:12.200 --> 35:15.272
- I love you, kiddo.
- I love you too, Daddy.

35:43.360 --> 35:44.839
And now, ladies and gentlemen...

35:45.000 --> 35:49.357
...please join me in congratulating
this year's debutantes.

36:29.040 --> 36:30.996
We never finished our conversation.

36:31.160 --> 36:33.390
I gotta tell you,
you got me a little concerned.

36:33.560 --> 36:36.757
Believe me, it's nothing
that can't wait until tomorrow.

36:37.880 --> 36:39.472
Don't the girls look beautiful?

36:40.120 --> 36:41.997
I hate dancing.

36:42.160 --> 36:43.309
Thanks.

36:43.480 --> 36:46.153
No, with you, it's...

36:46.320 --> 36:48.356
It's not horrible.

36:48.880 --> 36:50.632
You're sweet.

36:50.800 --> 36:54.315
- Are you leading?
- I'm trying.

36:54.480 --> 36:57.153
Attitude. I like that.

36:57.320 --> 37:00.915
I've put in an offer. I got a mortgage,
the kids are in private school.

37:01.080 --> 37:02.877
If there's a problem, I need to know.

37:03.040 --> 37:05.110
Now is not the time.

37:06.200 --> 37:07.349
Jimmy, where's my money?

37:08.480 --> 37:10.311
I asked you a question.
Where's my money?

37:10.480 --> 37:13.199
I didn't want you to find out
this way, but I don't have it.

37:13.360 --> 37:15.430
- What?
- I will, but I don't have it right now.

37:15.600 --> 37:18.273
- Lf you don't have my money, who does?
- Hey, look.

37:20.360 --> 37:23.750
I promise I'm working on it, all right?
There's been some bad investments.

37:23.920 --> 37:25.751
Are you telling me you lost everything?

37:26.160 --> 37:27.593
Would you just keep it down?

37:27.760 --> 37:31.275
I won't keep it down. That is my money.
My retirement, my kids' tuition!

37:31.440 --> 37:33.829
- I'm sorry.
- Son of a bitch!

37:34.880 --> 37:38.555
- Oh, my God.
- You're a thief! You took my money!

37:38.720 --> 37:39.994
Greg!

37:40.880 --> 37:43.678
I want my money back, you hear me?

37:43.880 --> 37:45.598
Get off me!

37:45.880 --> 37:47.871
You're a thief! You're a thief!

37:48.080 --> 37:49.195
- Get off me.
- Go outside.

37:49.360 --> 37:51.430
- He's a thief! You're a thief!
- Leave. Please.

37:51.600 --> 37:52.749
- Come on.
- He's a thief!

37:52.920 --> 37:54.433
Dad!

37:54.600 --> 37:56.272
Take it outside. Come on.

38:02.600 --> 38:04.397
I haven't seen you
in a fight since...

38:04.560 --> 38:06.676
...ever.
- Now you know why.

38:06.840 --> 38:09.593
What are you talking about?
He sucker-punched you.

38:10.520 --> 38:13.671
You didn't have to jump in like that,
defend Jimmy.

38:13.840 --> 38:16.070
Well, I've always had this thing
for the underdog.

38:17.280 --> 38:22.274
After I fill out the police report, maybe
we should go and see how he's doing.

38:23.640 --> 38:25.198
Hi.

38:27.320 --> 38:30.630
So, sorry. I know I promised
I wouldn't get into any fights.

38:30.800 --> 38:33.473
We can make an exception
in this case.

38:33.640 --> 38:37.315
The police, however, will have questions.
As your attorney, I advise you...

38:38.080 --> 38:40.594
...get out of here.
- Thanks.

38:43.800 --> 38:45.199
Hey.

38:47.200 --> 38:50.158
You don't mind if I walk
your date home, do you?

38:52.360 --> 38:53.952
- No.
- Cool.

38:54.120 --> 38:57.999
That's quite a debut you had tonight.
You know how to present yourself.

38:58.160 --> 39:00.913
Finally, a Cohen who can throw down.

39:01.080 --> 39:02.638
You wanna come with us?

39:03.600 --> 39:06.512
- I'll just see you at home.
- See you at home.

39:11.640 --> 39:14.950
So do you think
that I'll get to see you again?

39:15.840 --> 39:17.910
- No.
- Okay.

39:18.080 --> 39:19.399
No, it's just...

39:19.560 --> 39:21.596
I know this might sound kind of...

39:21.760 --> 39:23.478
...whatever...

39:23.640 --> 39:26.438
...but I'm spending the rest
of the summer on a sailing trip.

39:26.600 --> 39:28.716
To Tahiti.

39:28.880 --> 39:32.077
- You like sailing?
- Yeah.

40:10.840 --> 40:12.478
You okay?

40:15.440 --> 40:17.351
What happened in there?

40:19.600 --> 40:21.352
I don't know.

40:23.000 --> 40:25.150
What's gonna happen now?

40:29.840 --> 40:31.319
I don't know.

40:37.480 --> 40:39.311
Come on, let's go.

40:40.880 --> 40:42.199
Come on.

40:49.600 --> 40:50.953
Came as soon as I heard.

40:55.440 --> 40:57.112
Are you...?

41:00.840 --> 41:02.353
I'm sorry.

41:04.280 --> 41:06.510
Can I take you home?

41:08.240 --> 41:10.754
- We could talk, maybe.
- I...

41:11.440 --> 41:13.317
I just need to be alone right now.

41:16.880 --> 41:18.313
Thanks.
