WEBVTT

01:01.625 --> 01:02.458
Yeah?

01:02.541 --> 01:03.958
Where are you now?

01:04.041 --> 01:06.375
I told you, I'm on my way!

01:06.458 --> 01:09.083
What's with the attitude?
Your mother doesn't have long.

01:09.166 --> 01:10.708
I know!

01:10.791 --> 01:12.250
How long will you be?

01:12.333 --> 01:15.250
Almost there. I'm hurrying, okay?

01:15.333 --> 01:17.041
Have you been drinking again?

01:17.125 --> 01:18.625
What? No.

01:19.125 --> 01:23.500
-Please don't. Not at a time like this.
-I haven't drunk anything. Not a drop!

01:24.041 --> 01:25.666
Daddy, are you coming soon?

01:25.750 --> 01:28.333
Hey, Mina. I'll be there soon. Just wait.

01:29.833 --> 01:30.958
I'll call you back.

01:31.041 --> 01:32.333
Hey, wait--

01:34.000 --> 01:34.958
Yes?

01:35.041 --> 01:36.083
Well, Kudo?

01:36.583 --> 01:38.458
Where are you now?

01:38.541 --> 01:40.333
Huh? Why?

01:40.416 --> 01:42.125
We just heard from HQ.

01:42.958 --> 01:47.250
The tabloids are going to write about
our station taking bribes.

01:48.250 --> 01:49.083
What?

01:49.625 --> 01:52.375
Have you met with
the Senba group recently?

01:54.583 --> 01:55.583
Yeah, I met them.

01:56.333 --> 01:57.625
Did they give you much?

01:58.250 --> 02:01.291
-Wellâ€¦
-I'm asking what they gave you.

02:01.375 --> 02:04.166
I only did it because you said so, Chief.

02:04.250 --> 02:05.083
So it's you.

02:05.708 --> 02:07.416
That's why they're on to us.

02:08.291 --> 02:11.916
But obviously, we won't allow it
to get out, right?

02:12.416 --> 02:13.541
I don't know.

02:13.625 --> 02:15.416
I mean, this is all on you.

02:15.500 --> 02:16.916
Wait a moment.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.791
It's not just me! Chief, you also--

02:18.875 --> 02:21.000
An inspector from HQ
will come to our station.

02:21.083 --> 02:22.333
Wait, it's not just me.

02:22.416 --> 02:24.375
You can't just put everything on me!

02:24.458 --> 02:26.333
Hey, Chief! Hey!

02:27.083 --> 02:28.541
Shit! Goddamn it.

02:30.916 --> 02:32.500
I told you, I'm on my way!

02:32.583 --> 02:33.416
Your mother,

02:34.000 --> 02:35.250
she just passed away.

02:38.666 --> 02:39.625
Come quickly.

02:44.041 --> 02:44.875
Shit.

02:46.666 --> 02:47.625
Shit!

03:41.625 --> 03:42.666
Hey.

03:42.750 --> 03:44.416
Hey!

03:59.333 --> 04:01.500
Why?

04:02.041 --> 04:03.291
Why did all this happen?

04:21.291 --> 04:22.875
MISAKO

04:33.916 --> 04:35.291
Bloody hell!

04:46.041 --> 04:46.875
Shit.

04:47.708 --> 04:48.666
Shit!

04:51.333 --> 04:52.208
Shit.

05:23.666 --> 05:24.625
MISAKO

05:26.541 --> 05:27.666
Shit.

06:19.208 --> 06:20.166
Are you serious?

06:46.416 --> 06:47.583
Good evening.

06:47.666 --> 06:49.666
We're taking sobriety tests.

06:49.750 --> 06:50.958
Keep up the good work.

06:51.041 --> 06:52.125
Please blow here.

06:52.208 --> 06:53.541
No, I'm good, thanks.

06:55.250 --> 06:57.625
-I'm Kudo from Aihara station.
-Oh, sir.

06:59.625 --> 07:01.791
A busy end of year for you all. See you.

07:01.875 --> 07:02.708
Oh?

07:04.250 --> 07:05.791
Look, it's Mr. Kudo.

07:06.750 --> 07:08.666
Hey, it's Detective Kudo.

07:09.625 --> 07:10.791
Thanks for your work.

07:10.875 --> 07:11.875
Well,

07:12.416 --> 07:14.458
the year's nearly over already.

07:14.541 --> 07:16.416
How's your year been, Mr. Kudo?

07:16.500 --> 07:17.666
Blow into it, please.

07:17.750 --> 07:19.875
-I don't need to do that.
-Please blow.

07:19.958 --> 07:22.000
Don't ask a colleague to do that.

07:22.083 --> 07:23.958
Been drinking with girls at some bar?

07:24.041 --> 07:25.041
You're joking.

07:25.791 --> 07:26.791
As if.

07:26.875 --> 07:27.791
Please blow.

07:30.791 --> 07:33.333
Okay, I did drink.

07:33.416 --> 07:35.875
Just a social drink. That's all.

07:35.958 --> 07:38.708
Look, we're both police. Give me a break.

07:41.583 --> 07:42.500
Mr. Kudo.

07:43.750 --> 07:46.000
This is good timing.
Get out so we can chat.

07:46.083 --> 07:47.750
Listen, I'm in a rush!

07:53.125 --> 07:53.958
What's that?

07:55.000 --> 07:55.875
It's nothing.

07:55.958 --> 07:57.500
-What happened?
-Nothing.

07:57.583 --> 07:59.541
-Really?
-It's nothing, I said.

08:00.666 --> 08:01.708
What happened here?

08:01.791 --> 08:03.333
I bumped into something.

08:03.416 --> 08:05.666
-Was it an accident?
-Just a bump. Nothing major.

08:05.750 --> 08:06.833
-What?
-Okay, fine!

08:06.916 --> 08:08.958
You want me to get out, right?

08:21.125 --> 08:21.958
Mr. Kudo.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.333
You've overstepped.

08:26.458 --> 08:28.875
Everyone knows you accepted Senba bribes.

08:30.416 --> 08:33.916
Now you've had an accident.
Sorry, but we have to inspect your car.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.291
That's going too far.

08:35.375 --> 08:37.000
Hey, wait a minute!

08:37.083 --> 08:39.375
Give me a break. I need to go!

08:44.625 --> 08:45.708
Your phone's ringing.

08:45.791 --> 08:46.833
That's not mine.

08:46.916 --> 08:49.291
-Must be yours.
-That's not my ringtone.

08:57.500 --> 08:58.333
What?

09:00.083 --> 09:01.000
Wait a minute.

09:09.250 --> 09:10.375
Wait!

09:11.250 --> 09:13.958
Well, I just stuffed everything in there.

09:14.041 --> 09:15.041
Whose is it?

09:15.125 --> 09:17.166
-You said there's nothing in there.
-Exactly.

09:17.250 --> 09:18.583
Let's open the trunk.

09:18.666 --> 09:20.041
Hey, wait a minute!

09:20.125 --> 09:22.708
Wait! I told you not to open it!

09:22.791 --> 09:23.833
-Open it.
-Hey!

09:23.916 --> 09:25.041
What the hell?

09:25.125 --> 09:26.500
What's got into you?

09:30.250 --> 09:31.666
What's this prick doing?

09:37.250 --> 09:38.583
What the hell are you doing?

09:39.291 --> 09:40.916
-Stop!
-Be still!

09:43.291 --> 09:44.958
Stay still! Don't move!

10:05.166 --> 10:06.250
Did something happen?

10:06.333 --> 10:08.166
-Not your concern.
-Back to your car.

10:08.250 --> 10:10.208
I'm Yazaki from the regional police HQ.

10:10.291 --> 10:11.166
Are you okay?

10:12.625 --> 10:14.125
What are you fighting about?

10:16.291 --> 10:17.125
Evening, sir.

10:17.208 --> 10:19.708
I'm Kaji from the traffic division
at Aihara station.

10:19.791 --> 10:22.083
Detective Kudo from the same station.

10:23.875 --> 10:24.750
Detective?

10:25.375 --> 10:27.333
You're a detective from Aihara station?

10:30.166 --> 10:33.291
Mr. Kudo,
I'm an Internal Affairs inspector.

10:36.583 --> 10:37.458
Inspector?

10:37.541 --> 10:38.875
Yeah. Perfect timing.

10:38.958 --> 10:42.875
I'm on my way to your station now.
We've already been in touch.

10:42.958 --> 10:45.333
Would you come with me?

10:52.958 --> 10:54.416
I'm really sorry.

10:54.500 --> 10:56.500
-What is it?
-My mother just died.

10:57.208 --> 10:59.583
I'm hurrying to the hospital right now.

11:00.750 --> 11:03.333
I planned to go to the station after that.

11:03.833 --> 11:04.666
I see.

11:05.625 --> 11:07.500
So you'll come to the station after?

11:08.166 --> 11:09.208
Yes, I will.

11:17.791 --> 11:19.416
Okay. I'll see you then.

11:21.541 --> 11:22.416
Thank you.

11:44.125 --> 11:45.250
Bloody hell.

12:11.208 --> 12:12.583
AIHARA CENTRAL HOSPITAL

12:12.666 --> 12:15.000
I was like, "Where did it go?"
And I looked up.

12:15.500 --> 12:16.958
-A hawk was there.
-Whoa.

12:17.041 --> 12:20.083
That's why you need to be really careful.

12:26.208 --> 12:27.541
-Daddy!
-Mina.

12:36.500 --> 12:37.333
Mina.

12:49.291 --> 12:51.083
May I move her?

12:51.666 --> 12:53.250
Oh, yeah.

12:53.958 --> 12:55.208
Pardon me.

12:56.625 --> 12:59.333
They have to move your mother right away.

12:59.416 --> 13:00.500
Move her?

13:00.583 --> 13:04.583
Yes. I'm very sorry,
but the hospital is not a morgue.

13:04.666 --> 13:05.958
Yeah, but right away?

13:10.125 --> 13:12.083
-Come on.
-I know.

13:13.416 --> 13:14.541
What was it again?

13:15.250 --> 13:18.208
Mr. Kudo, have you decided
on a funeral home?

13:21.583 --> 13:23.125
Funeral home?

13:23.208 --> 13:26.833
If you haven't chosen yet,
there's a company we use often.

13:26.916 --> 13:28.791
I can contact them if you'd like.

13:28.875 --> 13:29.875
Please.

13:29.958 --> 13:32.125
We will be happy to arrange it.

13:34.708 --> 13:36.333
No good. He's not picking up.

13:36.916 --> 13:39.333
What the hell is he up to?

13:47.958 --> 13:49.958
I'm Yazaki from Internal Affairs.

13:50.041 --> 13:51.041
Thanks for coming.

13:51.125 --> 13:53.333
Yes, especially this time of year.

13:53.416 --> 13:54.416
Of course.

13:54.500 --> 13:56.791
Congratulations on your marriage.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.625
I'm not sure where the rumors came from.

14:03.166 --> 14:07.041
It's not like you can accept bribes
these days when compliance is so strict.

14:07.833 --> 14:12.708
I'll need accounts for the last decade
to check for any inappropriate expenses.

14:12.791 --> 14:14.916
-Prepare them by tomorrow.
-Of course.

14:15.000 --> 14:18.791
Also, there's a detective
named Kudo working here, right?

14:20.291 --> 14:23.041
That's right. Is there something up?

14:23.125 --> 14:24.791
I would like to talk to him.

14:24.875 --> 14:27.500
I actually met him on the way here.

14:28.125 --> 14:29.958
He said his mother just passed away.

14:32.500 --> 14:33.500
I see.

14:33.583 --> 14:35.875
So you hadn't been contacted yet.

14:36.416 --> 14:38.458
Apparently, he was
rushing to the hospital.

14:38.541 --> 14:42.083
He said he'd come here afterward,
so I'll wait for him here.

14:42.583 --> 14:45.000
Oh, so that's why.

14:45.708 --> 14:48.250
So is it something Kudo did?

14:49.291 --> 14:51.708
Just something I need
to speak to him about.

15:04.458 --> 15:06.083
Is the Kudo family there?

15:06.166 --> 15:07.125
Yes.

15:09.125 --> 15:11.333
Sorry to keep you waiting.

15:11.416 --> 15:14.458
My name is Takehara from Heartful Aihara.

15:16.333 --> 15:19.208
You have my deepest condolences.

15:21.583 --> 15:27.666
We received your telephone inquiry
regarding your mother's resting place.

15:27.750 --> 15:31.708
How about our own Aihara Hall?

15:31.791 --> 15:33.041
If you choose our--

15:33.125 --> 15:33.958
Sorry.

15:35.041 --> 15:36.583
-Come on!
-Yep.

15:37.291 --> 15:40.041
Kudo, did your mother pass away?

15:40.125 --> 15:43.166
Yes. I'm at the hospital right now.

15:44.291 --> 15:46.666
You said you'd come
to the station after, right?

15:48.625 --> 15:49.916
Who did you hear that from?

15:51.375 --> 15:53.208
The inspector is here.
He's waiting for you.

15:55.916 --> 15:57.083
When are you coming?

15:59.333 --> 16:04.750
First, we'll move her to Aihara Hallâ€¦

16:04.833 --> 16:08.208
Aihara Hall! Sounds good. Let's do that.

16:08.291 --> 16:12.125
I have to move my mother's body
to the venue now, so today will be tricky.

16:12.208 --> 16:15.458
-Kudo, what are you doing?
-I'll be at the station in the morning.

16:15.541 --> 16:17.666
-Sorry about that. Thanks a lot.
-Kudo!

16:39.208 --> 16:41.375
I'm sorry. That was Kudo.

16:41.458 --> 16:44.416
He can't come tonight
because of the funeral preparations.

16:44.500 --> 16:46.500
He said he'll come tomorrow morning.

16:49.791 --> 16:50.708
I see.

16:51.541 --> 16:52.666
Tomorrow morning.

16:54.250 --> 16:55.083
Yes.

16:56.625 --> 16:57.458
I understand.

16:58.000 --> 16:58.958
Until tomorrow, then.

17:10.291 --> 17:11.583
This is bad.

17:20.750 --> 17:24.125
Today we will keep your mother
in the mortuary.

17:24.875 --> 17:25.750
Thank you.

17:41.833 --> 17:44.416
We're going home.
We'll come again tomorrow.

17:45.666 --> 17:47.416
You'll help with the funeral too?

17:50.583 --> 17:51.958
I have to, right?

17:52.583 --> 17:54.291
We're still "family," for now.

17:57.916 --> 17:59.541
Get that thing to me soon, okay?

18:02.541 --> 18:03.500
Yes, I know.

18:39.500 --> 18:41.083
-Yes?
-Where are you now?

18:41.916 --> 18:44.875
Now? Aihara Hall.

18:44.958 --> 18:45.833
Right.

18:45.916 --> 18:48.250
We'll be there soon. Wait at the entrance.

18:49.083 --> 18:51.000
We need to agree on a story
about the bribes.

18:51.083 --> 18:53.500
Wait a minute!

18:53.583 --> 18:55.166
Can't we wait until tomorrow?

18:55.250 --> 18:57.166
We're arriving now. Come outside.

19:18.208 --> 19:19.083
That's it there.

19:19.666 --> 19:20.541
Right.

19:35.416 --> 19:36.250
Shit.

19:36.333 --> 19:37.166
Hey!

19:42.708 --> 19:43.958
Are you okay?

19:44.041 --> 19:45.458
Totally fine.

19:46.541 --> 19:49.000
Sorry to hear about your mother.

19:50.500 --> 19:52.500
Thanks. What's this about the inspector?

19:52.583 --> 19:55.833
The inspector wants
to speak to you tomorrow.

19:55.916 --> 19:57.708
Come to the station first thing.

19:57.791 --> 19:59.958
Maybe they know about
your dealings with Senba.

20:00.041 --> 20:03.500
The boss was just
a customer at my mother's place.

20:03.583 --> 20:04.666
That's enough.

20:04.750 --> 20:06.291
Wait a second, Chief.

20:06.375 --> 20:08.916
It's not just me
who received bribes, right?

20:09.416 --> 20:12.875
-The leak was about something recent.
-But it goes way back, right?

20:12.958 --> 20:15.000
What did you do with the money you got?

20:18.041 --> 20:18.875
Chief.

20:19.583 --> 20:21.250
Just heard from Kaji in traffic.

20:21.333 --> 20:22.375
Heyâ€¦

20:22.458 --> 20:25.708
Kudo was stopped at an inspection point
and didn't show them what was in his car.

20:26.375 --> 20:27.333
What?

20:28.625 --> 20:31.166
Better not be anything illegal in there.

20:31.250 --> 20:32.666
Of course there isn't!

20:32.750 --> 20:36.583
He drove away without being checked,
saying his mother had just died.

20:36.666 --> 20:38.166
Come on, don't be ridiculous!

20:38.750 --> 20:40.208
The traffic divisionâ€¦

20:40.291 --> 20:42.083
They just started accusing me.

20:52.208 --> 20:53.458
Hey. Open it.

20:54.708 --> 20:55.541
Yes, sir.

21:22.166 --> 21:24.916
Chief, my mother just died.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.333
Give me a break, will you?

21:27.416 --> 21:29.000
Really pisses me off.

21:30.041 --> 21:31.416
Sorry I didn't believe you.

21:56.333 --> 21:58.375
Calm down.

22:25.541 --> 22:30.958
DIVORCE APPLICATION

23:10.000 --> 23:12.458
Pull over to your left.

23:20.083 --> 23:21.083
Hello.

23:21.833 --> 23:22.666
So,

23:23.625 --> 23:25.791
that was a red light. Didn't you notice?

23:31.458 --> 23:32.791
Your mother died?

24:08.375 --> 24:10.666
Bit of a dangerous place to park, no?

24:11.666 --> 24:12.500
Well?

24:13.541 --> 24:14.416
Stupid.

24:22.250 --> 24:23.291
What?!

24:32.375 --> 24:34.875
Excuse me. It's about Kudo.

24:35.458 --> 24:36.500
What now?

24:37.208 --> 24:40.166
He caused an accident somewhere,
but he's on his way.

24:41.541 --> 24:43.500
What the hell is he doing?

24:44.750 --> 24:45.625
Excuse me.

25:09.291 --> 25:10.125
Hey!

25:10.625 --> 25:11.458
Hurry up!

25:11.958 --> 25:13.375
What's with that car?

25:13.458 --> 25:14.291
It's a rental.

25:14.958 --> 25:16.250
Mine's being repaired.

25:25.250 --> 25:26.208
Come on.

25:28.875 --> 25:29.708
Excuse me.

25:37.625 --> 25:38.458
Go on.

25:41.583 --> 25:42.791
We'll leave you to it.

25:55.958 --> 25:59.916
Seems like you're the one
with links to the Senba group.

26:00.000 --> 26:01.041
Well,

26:02.125 --> 26:03.458
you seeâ€¦

26:03.541 --> 26:04.416
It's okay.

26:06.375 --> 26:07.666
It happens.

26:09.291 --> 26:10.125
What?

26:10.958 --> 26:14.666
A bit of cash to turn a blind eye.
That's all it is, right?

26:16.458 --> 26:17.416
Don't worry.

26:17.958 --> 26:19.958
If that's it, then I'll cover it up.

26:24.958 --> 26:25.791
In my view,

26:26.791 --> 26:29.666
you need people like that
in an organization.

26:30.875 --> 26:33.958
Many things in this world
can't be resolved "neatly."

26:36.041 --> 26:36.875
Right.

26:38.791 --> 26:40.000
But, Mr. Kudoâ€¦

26:43.125 --> 26:46.250
there's something else
you're hiding, isn't there?

26:48.541 --> 26:51.041
Have you been dragged into something?

26:53.166 --> 26:54.000
No.

26:54.083 --> 26:56.791
The first thing we do in our line of work
is observe people's behavior.

26:56.875 --> 27:00.416
When I said I'd cover this up,
you didn't seem very relieved,

27:00.500 --> 27:03.458
which means there's
some other issue, correct?

27:06.166 --> 27:07.041
No, Iâ€¦

27:09.791 --> 27:10.666
No.

27:10.750 --> 27:12.125
Mr. Kudo.

27:13.250 --> 27:15.125
Please talk to me.

27:16.250 --> 27:17.625
I can help you.

27:25.291 --> 27:27.583
There's nothing, really.

27:27.666 --> 27:28.833
Really?

27:33.250 --> 27:34.166
Yes.

27:39.291 --> 27:40.208
I see.

27:40.708 --> 27:41.791
Well, I'm glad.

27:47.416 --> 27:48.833
What's going on in there?

27:48.916 --> 27:50.416
They've been a while.

27:50.500 --> 27:53.458
-What if he mentions you, Chief?
-Sorry to keep you waiting.

27:55.500 --> 27:58.666
It's nothing that warrants
any fuss at this time of year.

27:58.750 --> 28:01.500
I'll tell my superiors
there's nothing to worry about.

28:01.583 --> 28:03.708
I'll be off, then. Happy New Year.

28:04.541 --> 28:06.666
-Thanks for coming.
-Thank you.

28:12.458 --> 28:13.458
What a relief.

28:19.291 --> 28:20.375
What's with that guy?

28:20.458 --> 28:24.958
AIHARA HALL

28:34.708 --> 28:37.333
We will now close the coffin.

28:37.416 --> 28:39.750
Would you like to see the face
one last time?

28:49.708 --> 28:52.625
We will now close the coffin.

28:59.875 --> 29:04.166
Excuse me. It seems the ceremony
can be held at a Zenmyoji temple branch.

29:07.291 --> 29:09.333
A funeral on New Year's Eve.

29:10.125 --> 29:14.333
If left until the new year,
the funeral would have to be much later.

29:14.416 --> 29:18.000
After the funeral at Zenmyoji,

29:18.083 --> 29:21.958
the body will be cremated
at the town crematorium.

29:24.125 --> 29:25.375
Crematedâ€¦

29:28.916 --> 29:31.083
Do you know where Zenmyoji is?

29:32.625 --> 29:35.125
-There's a map on the other side.
-Thank you.

29:40.583 --> 29:43.208
Have you sent out invites
for people attending tomorrow?

29:54.166 --> 29:55.041
Wait!

30:28.791 --> 30:30.541
That is wonderful to hear!

30:30.625 --> 30:34.125
The chief mourner will keep
the wake candle burning

30:34.208 --> 30:36.875
instead of holding an official ceremony.

30:38.000 --> 30:39.750
You're going to stay here all night?

30:39.833 --> 30:42.791
She was a single mother,
and I was her only child.

30:42.875 --> 30:43.791
It's nothing.

30:43.875 --> 30:46.416
Daddy's not coming home, then?

30:46.500 --> 30:49.083
Tonight Daddy's going to stay
with Grandma.

30:49.166 --> 30:50.625
Then I'm staying too!

30:50.708 --> 30:52.125
No, you can't.

30:52.750 --> 30:54.958
Let Daddy take care of it tonight, okay?

30:55.958 --> 30:57.458
Okay, Mina, let's go.

30:58.458 --> 30:59.625
Don't be late tomorrow.

30:59.708 --> 31:00.708
All right.

31:01.208 --> 31:02.083
Bye-bye.

31:05.000 --> 31:05.833
Let's go.

33:57.916 --> 34:00.375
Sorry, Mom. I'm so sorry.

34:02.291 --> 34:03.250
Sorry.

34:21.666 --> 34:22.500
It's fine.

34:26.291 --> 34:27.833
Oh, Momâ€¦

34:29.875 --> 34:32.041
I'm so sorry.

34:38.166 --> 34:39.000
Excuse me.

34:48.500 --> 34:49.333
Good evening.

35:14.916 --> 35:16.083
Yes, that's right.

35:18.541 --> 35:19.375
Crap!

35:32.125 --> 35:33.166
In here.

35:44.875 --> 35:45.875
Why?

35:47.958 --> 35:49.500
It's too soon.

35:53.291 --> 35:54.125
Sorry.

35:54.708 --> 35:55.958
Thought I was alone.

35:56.041 --> 35:57.416
Oh, noâ€¦

35:58.041 --> 36:00.458
Sorry to have barged in like that.

36:00.541 --> 36:01.541
Sorry.

36:02.708 --> 36:03.541
That's fine.

36:05.250 --> 36:08.791
Weâ€¦ we've come to replace the dry ice.

36:10.125 --> 36:11.083
The dry ice?

36:12.375 --> 36:14.750
The dry ice inside the coffin.

36:14.833 --> 36:15.666
Oh.

36:16.750 --> 36:17.583
The dry ice.

36:18.916 --> 36:19.750
Well, then.

36:23.125 --> 36:27.541
Would you let me change the dry ice?

36:27.625 --> 36:28.541
What?

36:29.083 --> 36:30.791
As a final gesture for my mother.

36:32.208 --> 36:34.208
I want to be the one who does it.

36:38.625 --> 36:39.791
We understand.

36:41.125 --> 36:42.041
Please.

36:44.625 --> 36:45.458
There.

36:53.041 --> 36:54.083
There's a special way--

36:54.166 --> 36:55.291
It's fine.

36:55.375 --> 36:56.333
I've got this.

36:57.291 --> 36:58.333
Oh, right.

37:02.041 --> 37:03.333
-The placing--
-It's fine.

37:03.833 --> 37:06.375
On the stomach and chest.

37:06.458 --> 37:08.416
-On the stomach and chest.
-Yes.

37:08.500 --> 37:09.375
Stomach andâ€¦

37:30.083 --> 37:37.083
TOUCH ID OR ENTER PASSCODE

37:43.041 --> 37:43.875
Good evening.

37:43.958 --> 37:46.291
Mr. Senba, why are you here?

37:48.083 --> 37:50.791
It's not like I can come to the funeral.

37:56.083 --> 37:58.500
I shouldn't be meeting you right now.

37:59.000 --> 38:01.666
Because some journalist
is sniffing around?

38:03.250 --> 38:04.625
Let me pray for her.

38:13.208 --> 38:14.166
Can I see her face?

38:20.583 --> 38:22.833
It must be a weight off your shoulders.

38:24.958 --> 38:28.916
Her medical and care costs
must have been no joke.

38:29.416 --> 38:31.500
I'm still in debt hell as a result.

38:33.125 --> 38:36.041
Kazue kept saying the same thing.

38:36.125 --> 38:38.958
She didn't want to be stuck
in a place like this.

38:39.041 --> 38:41.291
Her final days spent
as a barmaid in the boonies.

38:42.250 --> 38:47.458
With a little more money,
she thought she'd live a better life.

38:48.750 --> 38:50.500
Kept saying that until the end.

38:51.291 --> 38:52.708
Who cares.

38:52.791 --> 38:55.583
Once you're dead, it's all over.

39:01.291 --> 39:04.041
There's a lizard that lives in the desert.

39:07.041 --> 39:07.916
Huh?

39:09.500 --> 39:14.208
This desert is completely barren.

39:16.583 --> 39:20.291
During the day,
the lizard manages to stand on the sand

39:20.875 --> 39:23.041
by hopping on its right and left leg.

39:24.583 --> 39:26.000
The sand is hot.

39:27.333 --> 39:31.041
When it gets hot,
it hops to the opposite leg.

39:31.541 --> 39:33.666
Hopping back and forth.

39:34.541 --> 39:39.916
It keeps its body still
and switches between legs

39:41.500 --> 39:42.666
until the sun sets.

39:47.000 --> 39:49.500
Better to go somewhere else, surely,

39:50.000 --> 39:51.375
but it doesn't leave.

39:52.875 --> 39:57.000
It just keeps switching between its legs

39:58.208 --> 39:59.416
from birth until death.

40:00.958 --> 40:02.500
What's your point?

40:06.541 --> 40:10.333
Do you want to get out of the desert?

40:12.500 --> 40:13.333
What?

40:14.708 --> 40:16.625
For that, you'll need money.

40:16.708 --> 40:20.291
An amount large enough
to change the way you live.

40:20.375 --> 40:23.250
Sure, and where would I find
that kind of money?

40:23.333 --> 40:25.125
Zenmyoji.

40:27.541 --> 40:29.333
They're stacked to the rafters.

40:32.208 --> 40:33.375
Zenmyoji.

40:35.333 --> 40:37.708
We're having the funeral there tomorrow.

40:39.958 --> 40:45.000
Their main temple
is the biggest in this region.

40:47.166 --> 40:50.291
They have strong links
with politicians in central government.

40:50.833 --> 40:53.583
High-ranking officials
make a special effort to visit.

40:55.583 --> 40:57.833
Why the fuss over a little rural temple?

40:59.208 --> 41:04.833
They've been collecting large donations
from those officials.

41:05.333 --> 41:06.500
I know.

41:07.458 --> 41:12.541
Apparently, all that cash
is kept in the temple's secret vault.

41:13.291 --> 41:14.125
That's right.

41:15.333 --> 41:17.000
That would be fine

41:18.333 --> 41:22.833
if they were managing it properly.

41:24.166 --> 41:25.000
What?

41:25.666 --> 41:29.416
Those high-ranking officials
are using the temple

41:30.291 --> 41:33.416
to "purify" their dirty money.

41:37.541 --> 41:40.333
The temple receives a commission
for its services.

41:41.583 --> 41:43.500
In other words, money laundering.

41:46.625 --> 41:47.541
Howeverâ€¦

41:49.541 --> 41:52.708
a young guy named Oda
was supposed to guard the cash,

41:52.791 --> 41:54.833
but he stole some and ran away.

41:57.208 --> 41:58.041
How much?

41:59.125 --> 42:01.208
Not sure, but over a hundred million.

42:05.583 --> 42:10.250
I know where that Oda punk is hiding.

42:13.291 --> 42:15.166
What are you telling me to do?

42:15.250 --> 42:16.166
You catch him.

42:20.583 --> 42:25.625
Then the police follow the trail
and expose the temple,

42:25.708 --> 42:28.166
and I take over things.

42:29.166 --> 42:30.041
Interested?

42:30.125 --> 42:31.208
Oh man!

42:31.791 --> 42:34.125
My mother just died, you know.

42:34.208 --> 42:35.333
Be more sensitive.

42:39.041 --> 42:42.458
Don't you want to get out of the desert?

42:58.250 --> 42:59.541
-Hello.
-Hey.

43:02.541 --> 43:03.625
Look at this.

43:04.875 --> 43:07.166
Hajime Oda, 29 years old.

43:07.250 --> 43:09.541
He has a criminal record
for selling cannabis.

43:10.041 --> 43:11.625
-He's a young pup.
-Yep.

43:11.708 --> 43:13.500
Take a good look at his face.

43:29.750 --> 43:32.125
That's Oda?

43:32.875 --> 43:34.958
Hey, do you know him?

43:36.333 --> 43:37.166
No.

43:37.666 --> 43:40.083
Hey, I got the search warrant.

43:41.083 --> 43:42.000
That was quick!

43:42.083 --> 43:44.791
It's the end of the year.
I bet you all want a break.

43:44.875 --> 43:46.208
Let's get this over with.

43:46.291 --> 43:47.208
Yes, sir!

43:49.166 --> 43:51.000
Right, all set?

43:51.083 --> 43:51.958
-Yes!
-Yep!

44:00.708 --> 44:02.333
There it is. You can see it now.

44:02.416 --> 44:03.458
Oh, right.

44:27.500 --> 44:28.416
Wait here, please.

44:32.500 --> 44:33.958
Let's go. You guys go around.

44:34.041 --> 44:34.875
Sure.

44:43.666 --> 44:44.666
Hey, Kudo!

44:45.166 --> 44:46.666
Don't be so obvious!

44:46.750 --> 44:47.583
Right.

44:48.125 --> 44:51.541
It just feels like he's not here.

44:51.625 --> 44:53.625
Why? It was your tip-off.

44:54.250 --> 44:57.583
I've just got this feeling he's not here.

44:59.708 --> 45:00.833
-Come on.
-Yeah.

45:11.416 --> 45:12.833
-Well?
-He's not here.

45:14.416 --> 45:15.250
Crap.

45:16.041 --> 45:19.083
Looks like he left in a hurry.

45:19.166 --> 45:20.916
He must have known we were coming.

45:52.333 --> 45:54.500
NEW MESSAGE

45:56.333 --> 45:58.833
I KNOW WHAT YOU DID

46:01.833 --> 46:03.500
YOU KILLED SOMEONE

46:11.958 --> 46:14.708
YOU KILLED ODA
YOU'RE A MURDERER

46:24.041 --> 46:27.125
WHO IS THIS?

46:30.375 --> 46:33.291
YOU CAN'T ESCAPE
I KNOW EVERYTHING

46:34.833 --> 46:35.833
What are you doing here?

46:36.666 --> 46:37.583
Nothingâ€¦

46:38.416 --> 46:39.791
As I thought, nothing here.

46:40.625 --> 46:42.083
Right, yeah.

46:49.916 --> 46:53.375
Huh? Isn't that a security camera?

46:55.958 --> 46:56.791
Hey.

46:58.500 --> 46:59.333
Look.

47:02.833 --> 47:03.833
Hey!

47:03.916 --> 47:04.791
-Yes?
-Yeah?

47:05.500 --> 47:08.750
There's a security camera there.

47:08.833 --> 47:10.250
Maybe it caught something.

47:11.166 --> 47:14.000
Right. It could have caught Oda escaping.

47:14.083 --> 47:15.833
Right. Let's go and check it out.

47:15.916 --> 47:16.875
Yes, sir.

47:17.625 --> 47:18.791
Excuse me.

47:18.875 --> 47:21.875
-Could we see footage from that camera?
-Sure.

47:23.625 --> 47:24.500
What the hell?

47:25.416 --> 47:26.833
The quality sucks.

47:27.416 --> 47:29.208
It's probably an old camera.

47:29.291 --> 47:31.041
Must have been set up ages ago.

47:34.625 --> 47:36.958
Isn't it your mother's funeral today?

47:37.041 --> 47:38.083
I've still got time.

47:38.166 --> 47:40.166
And? Did it show anything?

47:40.250 --> 47:41.791
No, nothing.

47:41.875 --> 47:44.166
Hardly any cars or people pass by there.

47:46.500 --> 47:48.416
Wait, something just passed by.

47:49.166 --> 47:50.000
Pause it.

47:51.750 --> 47:52.791
There.

47:58.375 --> 47:59.625
-One more time.
-Okay.

48:02.708 --> 48:04.500
Huh? What was that?

48:04.583 --> 48:06.500
That car stopped abruptly.

48:07.583 --> 48:08.416
One more time.

48:14.333 --> 48:16.166
-When was this?
-Two days ago.

48:17.458 --> 48:18.791
It's raining pretty hard.

48:20.000 --> 48:21.541
Get the car's plate.

48:21.625 --> 48:22.458
Sure.

48:28.708 --> 48:29.750
Zoom in.

48:29.833 --> 48:30.666
Okay.

48:31.625 --> 48:32.458
Zoom in more.

48:32.541 --> 48:33.375
Okay.

48:34.625 --> 48:36.250
Is that a three?

48:36.333 --> 48:37.291
An eight?

48:38.333 --> 48:40.000
-Eight, I think?
-That's a three.

48:40.083 --> 48:41.833
-It doesn't join on the left.
-Yeah.

48:52.416 --> 48:54.708
Shit, I can't make it out!

48:54.791 --> 48:56.000
We can't go on that.

48:56.958 --> 48:58.458
-Damn.
-Okay, I'm going.

48:58.541 --> 48:59.541
I have the funeral.

49:00.208 --> 49:01.333
I'm the chief mourner.

49:18.875 --> 49:20.541
Sorry, it looks like he's arrived.

49:21.958 --> 49:23.208
Why are you late?

49:23.291 --> 49:24.125
I had work.

49:24.208 --> 49:25.500
Hurry up!

49:26.250 --> 49:28.125
What's with the car?

49:29.500 --> 49:30.875
Where's Mina?

49:30.958 --> 49:32.833
Your colleague is looking after her.

49:32.916 --> 49:34.458
-What?
-Thank him afterward.

49:34.541 --> 49:35.375
Who?

49:35.458 --> 49:36.666
Come on, hurry!

49:36.750 --> 49:37.583
What?

49:37.666 --> 49:38.833
Hurry!

49:54.125 --> 49:55.708
UNKNOWN CALLER

50:09.166 --> 50:10.000
Yeah?

50:10.541 --> 50:13.708
You sure are calm,
considering you just killed someone.

50:15.041 --> 50:15.875
Right?

50:17.000 --> 50:17.958
Who are you?

50:18.541 --> 50:20.083
You're finished.

50:20.958 --> 50:22.500
I don't know what you're talking about.

50:23.000 --> 50:24.625
If it's a prank, I'm hanging up.

50:24.708 --> 50:26.541
Hang up and I'll report it.

50:27.750 --> 50:32.333
I'll report the corrupt cop
who ran over Oda and disposed of the body.

50:32.916 --> 50:35.041
Right, Yuji Kudo?

50:38.750 --> 50:39.625
So youâ€¦

50:41.833 --> 50:42.750
were watching?

50:43.875 --> 50:45.875
Yeah, I saw everything.

50:47.458 --> 50:48.458
So,

50:49.583 --> 50:52.583
you know where I buried the body?

50:55.458 --> 50:57.041
Of course I know.

50:59.083 --> 51:00.541
You dumbass!

51:00.625 --> 51:03.125
I haven't buried anything!

51:03.208 --> 51:05.791
You haven't seen a thing, have you?

51:05.875 --> 51:09.583
You're just talking shit, stupid idiot!

51:17.750 --> 51:19.083
Don't mess with me!

51:19.666 --> 51:21.833
You fucking brat! Think you're smart?

51:21.916 --> 51:23.041
Asshole!

51:30.041 --> 51:31.333
Oda.

51:33.166 --> 51:36.333
I want to know where Oda is, you bastard!

51:36.416 --> 51:37.625
Come on, fucker!

51:38.666 --> 51:41.958
I know you put the body
in the trunk, right?

51:42.916 --> 51:44.083
Tell me!

51:44.166 --> 51:45.958
Spit it out!

51:46.875 --> 51:48.125
Where is he?

51:48.625 --> 51:50.208
Tell me now!

51:50.291 --> 51:52.041
Spit it out!

52:07.666 --> 52:09.875
Listen carefully.

52:13.333 --> 52:16.708
If you don't hand him over,
your daughter will vanish.

52:18.166 --> 52:19.541
Bring him to me.

52:20.958 --> 52:22.833
At 5:00 p.m. today.

52:24.125 --> 52:24.958
Got it?

53:23.875 --> 53:25.833
You've reached voice mail.

53:26.541 --> 53:29.833
Please leave a message after the beep.

53:30.500 --> 53:33.375
Press "1" to end the recording.

53:33.458 --> 53:38.125
Press "#" to check or change your message.

53:39.708 --> 53:41.250
Oda, answer your phone.

53:42.041 --> 53:43.666
I'll still give you a chance.

53:47.250 --> 53:48.791
Your message has been record--

53:50.708 --> 53:51.875
Son of a bitch.

53:54.375 --> 53:55.625
That idiot Oda.

53:55.708 --> 53:58.958
He didn't know security required
a key card and a fingerprint.

54:00.291 --> 54:03.125
Even though it only opens
with your fingerprints, Yazaki.

54:11.458 --> 54:12.333
Sorry.

54:14.875 --> 54:15.833
Sorry.

54:24.916 --> 54:27.208
So Oda ran off with the key?

54:27.708 --> 54:28.541
Yes.

54:29.041 --> 54:31.583
But he hasn't taken the money.

54:32.291 --> 54:34.833
-That's right.
-It's simple, then.

54:35.375 --> 54:38.625
Just need to catch this Oda
and get the key back, right?

54:38.708 --> 54:39.541
Yes.

54:39.625 --> 54:43.166
But it must be before the end of the year.

54:44.125 --> 54:47.458
I promised them we'd hand over
the money at the start of the year.

54:48.083 --> 54:50.708
They're an important client.
You understand, right?

54:50.791 --> 54:52.000
I understand.

54:52.083 --> 54:54.333
Find him. Use the yakuza if need be.

54:54.416 --> 54:55.250
Yes, sir.

54:55.333 --> 54:56.583
Don't embarrass me, okay?

54:58.875 --> 55:02.083
You're going to be my son-in-law tomorrow.

55:04.791 --> 55:05.666
Yes, sir.

55:05.750 --> 55:09.666
Also, about the bribery case
at Aihara station,

55:09.750 --> 55:10.958
just let that lie.

55:11.041 --> 55:14.541
Those beggars are just trying to earn
a bit of loose change.

55:20.833 --> 55:22.000
Well, well.

55:22.500 --> 55:26.583
Should someone from police HQ
really be visiting me?

55:26.666 --> 55:29.750
Hajime Oda, 29 years old.
We need you to find him.

55:29.833 --> 55:33.125
You must be in a real quandary

55:33.208 --> 55:36.000
if you need help
from an old yakuza nearing retirement.

55:36.083 --> 55:38.625
We want him by the end of the year.
Can you do it?

55:41.583 --> 55:44.041
How much will you pay for finding him?

55:44.125 --> 55:45.125
Ten million.

55:46.833 --> 55:49.416
Ten million yen for a young hoodlum.

55:50.125 --> 55:52.000
What on earth did he do?

55:53.000 --> 55:55.125
I'd rather you not ask questions.

55:59.250 --> 56:00.083
Of course.

56:01.541 --> 56:02.750
We'll find him.

56:07.875 --> 56:09.083
Welcome home.

56:09.833 --> 56:10.791
I'm back.

56:18.625 --> 56:20.416
It's nearly ready.

56:20.500 --> 56:21.333
Sure.

56:25.416 --> 56:27.375
I heard you saw my dad today.

56:27.875 --> 56:28.708
Oh?

56:29.291 --> 56:30.416
He called.

56:31.375 --> 56:33.750
He said how hard you've been working.

56:33.833 --> 56:36.625
Yeah, it's been pretty busy.

56:47.541 --> 56:49.583
THERE'S STILL TIME

56:49.666 --> 56:51.541
TELL ME

56:51.625 --> 56:53.125
-Here you are.
-Thank you.

56:54.583 --> 56:55.500
Something up?

56:56.375 --> 56:57.333
No, nothing.

56:58.458 --> 56:59.583
Oh, yes.

57:00.375 --> 57:02.708
I wrote something
for the ceremony tomorrow.

57:03.208 --> 57:05.000
-Can you listen to it?
-Sure.

57:05.083 --> 57:06.375
You can eat while I read.

57:09.750 --> 57:10.916
Right.

57:14.291 --> 57:16.416
"Dear Mom and Dad,

57:18.083 --> 57:22.083
thank you for raising me."

57:23.291 --> 57:27.666
"As an only child,
I used to wish I had siblings."

57:28.625 --> 57:31.541
"But now I realize I was lucky."

57:33.833 --> 57:37.375
"It means I was able to have
your love and affection all to myselfâ€¦"

57:37.458 --> 57:38.791
NEW MESSAGE
ODA

57:38.875 --> 57:42.041
SCREWED IF YOU CAN'T GET THAT MONEY, HUH?

57:42.125 --> 57:43.708
SERVES YOU RIGHT, PRICK

57:45.083 --> 57:47.250
"Dad, when I was really ill,

57:48.458 --> 57:50.916
even though you were away for work,

57:51.708 --> 57:53.541
you came back to see me every week."

57:54.208 --> 57:56.458
"That made me so happy."

57:56.541 --> 57:57.958
WE'VE DONE A LOT FOR YOU

57:58.041 --> 58:01.041
"Today my name will changeâ€¦

58:01.125 --> 58:03.166
WE'VE DONE A LOT FOR YOU UP TO NOW

58:03.250 --> 58:05.416
â€¦from Yukiko Uematsu to Yukiko Yazaki."

58:06.000 --> 58:07.583
BUT YOU TREATED ME LIKE AN IDIOT

58:07.666 --> 58:10.750
"But I'll always be your loving daughterâ€¦

58:13.000 --> 58:14.750
forever and ever."

58:14.833 --> 58:16.625
REAP WHAT YOU SOW
YOU'RE DONE

58:16.708 --> 58:21.583
"Mom, Dad, I'm so grateful
for everything you've done for me."

58:22.166 --> 58:24.083
BTW YOUR WEDDING IS TOMORROW, RIGHT?

58:26.000 --> 58:27.000
"Thank you."

58:27.083 --> 58:29.208
WISHING YOU THE UTMOST HAPPINESS LOL

58:34.166 --> 58:35.208
That was so moving.

59:10.583 --> 59:11.708
Cold, huh, Chief?

59:12.333 --> 59:14.208
This is the worst time for a wedding.

59:14.291 --> 59:15.916
UNLESS IT'S ME, THAT DOOR WON'T OPEN

59:16.000 --> 59:18.208
No one holds a wedding
after the 28th, right?

59:18.291 --> 59:19.708
GIVE UP ALREADY

59:19.791 --> 59:22.750
-Not if you're sensible.
-Right.

59:22.833 --> 59:25.875
Only the elite can get away with
a wedding at the end of the year.

59:25.958 --> 59:29.208
Director General Uematsu
is the only elite around here.

59:29.291 --> 59:33.083
Honestly, making a move
on the director general's only daughter?

59:33.166 --> 59:36.166
Yeah. Must be desperate for a promotion.

59:50.041 --> 59:51.125
How's it going?

59:51.208 --> 59:52.625
They're looking for him now.

59:53.833 --> 59:56.666
A dog that bites its owner
needs putting down.

59:57.250 --> 59:59.958
You know what to do with Oda
when he's found, right?

01:00:00.041 --> 01:00:01.291
-Yes.
-Right?

01:00:01.375 --> 01:00:02.625
Yes.

01:00:02.708 --> 01:00:05.416
-Sorry to interrupt, Mr. Yazaki.
-Sure.

01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:09.875
The hall is making handprint artwork
of the bride and groom.

01:00:09.958 --> 01:00:11.041
Press your hand here.

01:00:11.125 --> 01:00:12.291
A handprint?

01:00:12.375 --> 01:00:14.083
-Oh, yes, you said.
-Yes.

01:00:14.166 --> 01:00:15.291
Like this?

01:00:15.375 --> 01:00:19.250
Yes. We'll get the bride's print
once you've both changed clothes.

01:00:19.333 --> 01:00:21.041
-Thanks.
-That's really nice.

01:00:21.125 --> 01:00:22.791
A great way to remember this day.

01:00:22.875 --> 01:00:24.625
-Want mine as well?
-No, thank you.

01:00:24.708 --> 01:00:25.541
No?

01:00:25.625 --> 01:00:27.500
Right, I'll press here.

01:00:27.583 --> 01:00:28.583
Thank you very much.

01:00:29.291 --> 01:00:31.250
Sorry to interrupt.

01:00:31.333 --> 01:00:34.458
It's time now for a special event.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.625
We would like to create
an artwork of your handprints

01:00:42.708 --> 01:00:45.958
to symbolize your unending love
for each other.

01:00:50.041 --> 01:00:53.000
The meaning
imbued in this artwork is that,

01:00:53.083 --> 01:00:55.750
hand in hand,
the couple will share any happiness

01:00:55.833 --> 01:00:58.125
and overcome any difficulty together.

01:00:58.833 --> 01:01:01.916
First, we'll ask the bride, Yukiko.

01:01:08.750 --> 01:01:12.041
And the groom, Takayuki, please.

01:01:24.833 --> 01:01:25.875
Thank you very much.

01:01:26.375 --> 01:01:30.250
Everyone, please come to the front,
and we'll take a picture.

01:01:47.125 --> 01:01:48.750
Hello, Mr. Yazaki.

01:01:48.833 --> 01:01:51.500
Oda might be on his way there now.
I'll be there soon.

01:01:51.583 --> 01:01:52.708
Oh, really?

01:01:52.791 --> 01:01:53.625
Yeah.

01:01:54.458 --> 01:01:55.875
Actually, already here.

01:02:01.750 --> 01:02:03.416
I did it. It's done.

01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:04.833
-Oh, you did it?
-Yes.

01:02:05.958 --> 01:02:09.375
You won't be able
to open the vault now, will you?

01:02:10.583 --> 01:02:12.625
Even though
the officials' money is in there.

01:02:13.250 --> 01:02:16.125
You're screwed now, aren't you?
Will they let you live?

01:02:16.208 --> 01:02:17.375
-What'll you--
-Hey, Oda.

01:02:17.458 --> 01:02:20.375
-Huh?
-Do you understand what you've done?

01:02:23.125 --> 01:02:24.000
Mr. Yazaki.

01:02:24.833 --> 01:02:26.125
You're finished.

01:02:27.250 --> 01:02:28.375
Suck on that!

01:02:28.458 --> 01:02:29.458
Dumbass!

01:02:35.291 --> 01:02:36.458
Are you stupid?

01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:40.041
What the hell are you doing?

01:02:40.541 --> 01:02:41.458
I'm very sorry.

01:02:42.208 --> 01:02:45.541
If we can't get the money back,
I'm finished.

01:02:45.625 --> 01:02:47.125
As are you, of course.

01:02:47.208 --> 01:02:48.333
-Yes.
-Understand?

01:02:51.833 --> 01:02:52.666
I'm sorry.

01:02:54.541 --> 01:02:57.083
It'll be fine. Relax.

01:02:57.166 --> 01:02:58.000
Yes, sir.

01:02:58.583 --> 01:03:01.833
-You will find Oda and snuff him out.
-Yes.

01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:04.000
-And return the key.
-Yes, sir.

01:03:04.708 --> 01:03:06.833
-You can do that, no problem, right?
-Yes.

01:03:06.916 --> 01:03:08.000
No problem.

01:03:10.083 --> 01:03:11.750
-Yes.
-Dad!

01:03:13.791 --> 01:03:17.333
-One of the guests wants a photo with you.
-Sure, just a sec.

01:03:26.291 --> 01:03:27.375
By the end of today.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:29.833
Got it?

01:03:30.333 --> 01:03:31.166
Yes.

01:03:47.666 --> 01:03:48.500
Yes?

01:03:48.583 --> 01:03:50.250
This is Senba.

01:03:50.333 --> 01:03:53.208
Yazaki, it seems luck is on your side.

01:03:53.958 --> 01:03:57.291
My guys found that punk Oda's hideout.

01:04:01.708 --> 01:04:02.750
Really?

01:04:02.833 --> 01:04:05.708
Oda was selling drugs on the side.

01:04:06.291 --> 01:04:10.208
He was using some girl
from a nightclub to sell his stuff.

01:04:10.875 --> 01:04:14.958
We tracked her and found his hideout.

01:04:15.041 --> 01:04:16.583
That's good to hear.

01:04:17.833 --> 01:04:19.000
Where is this place?

01:04:19.958 --> 01:04:20.833
I'll tell you.

01:04:21.875 --> 01:04:25.083
It's just that ten million
isn't really enough.

01:04:27.083 --> 01:04:28.000
What?

01:04:28.083 --> 01:04:31.166
I had it looked into.

01:04:31.250 --> 01:04:32.875
That's some amount.

01:04:33.666 --> 01:04:37.458
That's one big pile you're dealing with.

01:04:38.208 --> 01:04:39.333
Who told you?

01:04:39.416 --> 01:04:41.083
As payment for finding him,

01:04:41.791 --> 01:04:42.875
one hundred million?

01:04:43.458 --> 01:04:45.625
One hundred million, how about that?

01:04:49.666 --> 01:04:52.291
If Oda takes it, there'll be nothing.

01:04:54.041 --> 01:04:58.666
Don't worry. We've taken care of that.

01:05:30.125 --> 01:05:30.958
What's this?

01:05:34.041 --> 01:05:35.500
Hey, what's going on?

01:05:35.583 --> 01:05:37.583
This isn't what we agreed on!

01:05:46.875 --> 01:05:48.458
Oda, you're late.

01:06:00.375 --> 01:06:01.208
Where's Oda?

01:06:11.250 --> 01:06:13.416
Has he gone to get the money?

01:06:18.833 --> 01:06:19.916
Well?

01:06:28.291 --> 01:06:30.958
Will he be coming back here?

01:06:47.208 --> 01:06:48.166
Hey, Mayuko.

01:06:48.250 --> 01:06:51.208
It's no good. The Senba group was there.

01:06:51.791 --> 01:06:53.250
It's not what they promised.

01:06:54.708 --> 01:06:56.125
Messing with me.

01:06:58.583 --> 01:07:00.208
What's the matter?

01:07:00.750 --> 01:07:01.750
Oda.

01:07:07.875 --> 01:07:11.041
I was an idiot to trust you.

01:07:14.791 --> 01:07:16.625
You can pay me back now by dying.

01:07:20.916 --> 01:07:22.208
Seriously?

01:07:22.916 --> 01:07:24.291
Seriously.

01:07:28.916 --> 01:07:30.333
Youâ€¦

01:07:32.958 --> 01:07:33.791
Shit.

01:07:52.541 --> 01:07:53.583
You little punk!

01:07:56.666 --> 01:07:57.791
Don't mess with me!

01:08:03.083 --> 01:08:04.541
You fucking punk!

01:08:22.833 --> 01:08:24.458
Hey!

01:08:28.208 --> 01:08:31.583
What is this? Hey!

01:08:59.375 --> 01:09:00.625
Hey, wait!

01:09:00.708 --> 01:09:01.916
Noâ€¦

01:09:04.041 --> 01:09:05.625
He has taken off with him!

01:09:07.083 --> 01:09:10.666
Shit!

01:09:32.250 --> 01:09:33.583
What the hell is he doing?

01:09:49.708 --> 01:09:53.000
Evening, sir. I'm Kaji from
the traffic division at Aihara station.

01:09:53.083 --> 01:09:55.333
Detective Kudo from the same station.

01:09:57.125 --> 01:10:00.125
Detective? You're a detective
from Aihara station?

01:10:12.291 --> 01:10:14.625
-Yazaki from Internal Affairs.
-Thanks for coming.

01:10:14.708 --> 01:10:16.625
Thanks for coming at this time of year.

01:10:16.708 --> 01:10:17.541
Sure.

01:10:17.625 --> 01:10:19.958
Congratulations on your wedding today.

01:10:21.208 --> 01:10:22.958
That was Kudo.

01:10:23.041 --> 01:10:26.125
He can't come tonight
because of the funeral preparations.

01:10:26.208 --> 01:10:28.125
He said he'll come tomorrow morning.

01:10:34.041 --> 01:10:34.958
I see.

01:10:35.583 --> 01:10:41.541
AIHARA POLICE STATION

01:10:56.166 --> 01:10:57.000
Soâ€¦

01:11:00.708 --> 01:11:03.416
you're telling me
that detective took the body away,

01:11:03.500 --> 01:11:05.666
and now you have no idea where it is?

01:11:05.750 --> 01:11:06.708
Yes.

01:11:06.791 --> 01:11:08.875
But I'm meeting
that detective in the morning,

01:11:08.958 --> 01:11:11.458
so I'll somehow persuade him
and get it back.

01:11:11.958 --> 01:11:13.166
I'm very sorry.

01:11:13.666 --> 01:11:16.416
How stupid can you be?

01:11:19.041 --> 01:11:21.458
I had no idea you were such a loser!

01:11:22.125 --> 01:11:25.041
I'm ashamed of myself!

01:11:25.125 --> 01:11:29.083
Ashamed I chose someone as stupid as you!

01:11:30.333 --> 01:11:32.458
I thought you were loyal to me.

01:11:32.541 --> 01:11:34.541
That's why I gave you special treatment.

01:11:35.041 --> 01:11:36.916
But you were just a stupid fool!

01:11:41.083 --> 01:11:43.208
I shouldn't have let you have my daughter.

01:11:44.291 --> 01:11:46.250
I thought you'd be more useful.

01:11:47.708 --> 01:11:48.791
But enough is enough.

01:11:52.250 --> 01:11:54.583
Leave my daughter
at the start of the new year.

01:11:56.083 --> 01:11:58.416
Forget any ideas you had
about being promoted.

01:12:01.666 --> 01:12:03.375
You're finished.

01:12:33.625 --> 01:12:34.541
Uematsu.

01:12:41.208 --> 01:12:42.500
Yazaki!

01:13:56.500 --> 01:13:58.041
FUNERAL

01:14:01.958 --> 01:14:02.833
Honestly.

01:14:04.958 --> 01:14:06.833
What happened to your face?

01:14:15.750 --> 01:14:16.583
What is it?

01:14:20.583 --> 01:14:21.833
I'll leave the rest to you.

01:14:21.916 --> 01:14:23.916
-Yes, sir.
-Mr. Kugayama.

01:14:25.125 --> 01:14:27.333
-It's about the car.
-What's up?

01:14:27.416 --> 01:14:29.708
We got this from another security camera.

01:14:38.291 --> 01:14:39.291
What do you mean?

01:14:41.333 --> 01:14:44.333
Don't worry.
I'll bring Mina back after the funeral.

01:14:44.416 --> 01:14:47.208
What do you mean, "don't worry"?

01:14:48.458 --> 01:14:51.125
Does that mean they've abducted Mina?

01:14:54.166 --> 01:14:55.041
Answer me!

01:14:55.125 --> 01:14:56.750
I told you not to worry.

01:14:56.833 --> 01:14:58.875
-It'll be fine.
-What is going on?

01:15:01.916 --> 01:15:02.958
What is this?

01:15:05.041 --> 01:15:05.958
Why?

01:15:07.916 --> 01:15:10.791
Why does this stuff
always happen with you?

01:15:18.375 --> 01:15:19.833
If something happens to Mina,

01:15:20.416 --> 01:15:22.208
I will never forgive you.

01:15:55.083 --> 01:15:57.416
His poor wife.
It's a lot to handle at this time of year.

01:16:02.375 --> 01:16:04.250
Now we'll bring out the coffin.

01:16:04.333 --> 01:16:06.666
-This isn't easy.
-Careful!

01:16:06.750 --> 01:16:07.791
You okay?

01:16:07.875 --> 01:16:08.875
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:16:08.958 --> 01:16:10.041
It's so heavy.

01:16:10.125 --> 01:16:11.125
Wait a minute.

01:16:11.208 --> 01:16:12.916
Oh, I kicked someone's shoes.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:14.166
-It's fine.
-Your shoes?

01:16:14.250 --> 01:16:15.125
I've got them on.

01:16:16.125 --> 01:16:17.166
Watch the step.

01:16:18.750 --> 01:16:19.583
All good.

01:16:20.916 --> 01:16:22.833
There we go.

01:16:25.541 --> 01:16:26.375
Thanks.

01:16:29.583 --> 01:16:31.875
The Kudo family, please take the bus.

01:16:37.750 --> 01:16:39.791
HEARTFUL AIHARA

01:16:47.541 --> 01:16:49.208
NEW MESSAGE

01:16:54.958 --> 01:16:57.416
AIHARA RESERVOIR, AICHI PREFECTURE

01:17:10.375 --> 01:17:11.208
Hello again.

01:17:11.875 --> 01:17:14.500
I will now show you to the waiting room.

01:17:17.750 --> 01:17:19.333
Please watch the step.

01:17:21.833 --> 01:17:22.750
Hey, wait.

01:17:24.041 --> 01:17:25.333
I have to take this.

01:17:37.750 --> 01:17:39.041
Stop right there!

01:17:40.333 --> 01:17:41.166
Police.

01:17:41.916 --> 01:17:43.708
-There's been an incident.
-Incident?

01:17:43.791 --> 01:17:46.208
I need you
to go to a safe place immediately.

01:17:46.291 --> 01:17:47.166
What?

01:17:48.625 --> 01:17:50.500
-Come on now, hurry!
-Yes!

01:17:52.083 --> 01:17:55.000
Wait! Why did you switch it on?

01:18:12.583 --> 01:18:13.416
Kudo.

01:18:18.166 --> 01:18:19.083
Kugayama.

01:18:19.583 --> 01:18:23.416
What are you hiding from us?

01:18:23.958 --> 01:18:24.833
What?

01:18:25.791 --> 01:18:28.583
This is your car, right?

01:18:34.291 --> 01:18:35.125
Come on.

01:18:36.125 --> 01:18:37.500
Just tell me the truth.

01:18:44.791 --> 01:18:45.916
I'll tell you later.

01:18:46.916 --> 01:18:48.041
I need your help.

01:18:49.750 --> 01:18:50.583
What?

01:18:52.875 --> 01:18:53.708
Damn!

01:18:55.708 --> 01:18:56.666
Ready, andâ€¦

01:19:00.416 --> 01:19:02.666
Seriously, what kind of story is that?

01:19:02.750 --> 01:19:03.791
Sounds made up.

01:19:03.875 --> 01:19:05.083
I wish it were.

01:19:07.458 --> 01:19:09.125
Why does he want this body so much?

01:19:09.208 --> 01:19:10.500
That's what I want to know.

01:19:10.583 --> 01:19:12.000
Did you take a good look?

01:19:12.083 --> 01:19:13.041
What?

01:19:28.416 --> 01:19:29.458
He's been shot.

01:19:29.958 --> 01:19:30.791
What?

01:19:31.291 --> 01:19:34.875
Which means he was shot
before you ran him over.

01:19:34.958 --> 01:19:37.000
What the hell? What's going on here?

01:19:53.458 --> 01:19:55.500
MISSED CALLS
MAYUKO, YAZAKI

01:19:58.500 --> 01:20:00.250
MAYUKO

01:20:03.500 --> 01:20:04.500
Hi, Oda?

01:20:09.500 --> 01:20:12.958
You're alive! I was so worried.

01:20:13.041 --> 01:20:14.208
I called so many times.

01:20:14.291 --> 01:20:16.625
Why didn't you answer?
I thought you were dead!

01:20:17.791 --> 01:20:19.500
Such a relief.

01:20:19.583 --> 01:20:21.375
I was really worried!

01:20:22.208 --> 01:20:23.958
Where are you now? The factory?

01:20:25.666 --> 01:20:26.916
Okay. I'll be there soon.

01:20:48.333 --> 01:20:50.916
Hey, you're late!

01:20:54.416 --> 01:20:55.250
What?

01:20:56.041 --> 01:20:57.708
Wait, what?

01:20:58.291 --> 01:20:59.916
Wait, who are you?

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.166
Go away! Seriously, who are you?

01:21:03.791 --> 01:21:06.666
He's the one
who ran off with the key card!

01:21:12.125 --> 01:21:13.000
This is it.

01:21:13.083 --> 01:21:13.916
GOOD LUCK CHARM

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.250
So that's what it's about.

01:21:16.333 --> 01:21:19.458
By the way, the second lock
won't open without his fingerprint.

01:21:22.375 --> 01:21:24.750
So that's why he wanted the body.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:28.958
I can't take this.

01:21:36.041 --> 01:21:37.291
What will you do?

01:21:40.541 --> 01:21:42.125
Get my daughter back.

01:21:43.333 --> 01:21:44.416
That's dangerous.

01:21:47.416 --> 01:21:49.208
It's the only thing I can do.

01:21:55.625 --> 01:21:57.583
I'll get Chief Awashima's advice.

01:21:58.875 --> 01:22:01.416
You just think about
how to rescue your daughter.

01:22:01.500 --> 01:22:04.208
But don't do anything on your own.

01:22:05.083 --> 01:22:06.875
We'll take care of it somehow.

01:22:07.625 --> 01:22:08.583
Kugayama.

01:22:11.291 --> 01:22:12.125
Thanks.

01:22:19.041 --> 01:22:20.791
UNKNOWN CALLER

01:22:30.416 --> 01:22:31.250
Yes?

01:22:31.333 --> 01:22:33.083
Who are you with right now?

01:22:33.791 --> 01:22:35.416
None of your business.

01:22:36.333 --> 01:22:38.625
Don't you care
what happens to your daughter?

01:22:41.708 --> 01:22:43.166
I need to talk with you.

01:22:43.250 --> 01:22:44.833
Get out of the car.

01:22:55.791 --> 01:22:56.666
What is it?

01:22:57.416 --> 01:22:59.000
Move away from the car first.

01:22:59.083 --> 01:23:00.416
Then I'll tell you.

01:23:34.250 --> 01:23:36.625
Whatâ€¦

01:23:36.708 --> 01:23:38.416
what have you done?

01:23:39.875 --> 01:23:41.166
What the hell did you do?

01:23:42.541 --> 01:23:44.375
Don't get any stupid ideas.

01:23:45.125 --> 01:23:46.541
You should be talking to me.

01:23:47.041 --> 01:23:48.083
Minaâ€¦

01:23:48.166 --> 01:23:50.875
If anything happens to Mina,
there'll be hell to pay.

01:23:51.375 --> 01:23:52.208
Hey!

01:23:52.750 --> 01:23:54.333
Bring Oda's body.

01:24:04.291 --> 01:24:05.458
Fuck!

01:24:13.250 --> 01:24:15.791
What was that loud noise?

01:24:15.875 --> 01:24:16.708
You okay?

01:24:18.958 --> 01:24:20.250
You gonna cut me free?

01:24:20.333 --> 01:24:22.458
Come on. Do it quickly.

01:24:26.583 --> 01:24:28.208
Hey, what are you doing?

01:24:28.291 --> 01:24:29.666
Hey, stop that!

01:24:29.750 --> 01:24:32.791
Are you crazy? Stop that!

01:24:33.666 --> 01:24:34.500
Wait--

01:24:41.666 --> 01:24:44.666
As soon as you swap
the body for your daughter,

01:24:45.291 --> 01:24:48.000
no doubt he'll take you out.

01:24:49.458 --> 01:24:51.166
Whoa, incredible.

01:24:51.666 --> 01:24:52.916
What era is this?

01:24:54.458 --> 01:24:57.625
If it comes to a normal gunfight,
you won't beat him.

01:24:57.708 --> 01:24:58.916
I know that.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.208
But what other way is there?

01:25:01.291 --> 01:25:04.541
Oh, this takes me back!

01:25:05.041 --> 01:25:06.833
I made this myself.

01:25:07.875 --> 01:25:08.750
What is it?

01:25:09.750 --> 01:25:10.583
A bomb?

01:25:11.208 --> 01:25:13.666
It blows up
exactly four minutes after you set it.

01:25:13.750 --> 01:25:15.916
Those were the good old days.

01:25:41.833 --> 01:25:43.083
Did you bring it?

01:25:43.958 --> 01:25:44.791
Mina?

01:25:45.583 --> 01:25:46.958
She's in the car. Show me the body.

01:25:47.041 --> 01:25:48.958
-Mina!
-You show me first.

01:26:19.583 --> 01:26:21.125
Is she really there?

01:26:21.833 --> 01:26:23.250
Show me if she is.

01:26:31.291 --> 01:26:32.166
Get out.

01:26:34.583 --> 01:26:36.083
-Daddy!
-Mina.

01:26:36.166 --> 01:26:37.500
Mina!

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.541
You won't get her
until I've checked the body.

01:26:40.625 --> 01:26:41.625
Bring it here.

01:26:58.583 --> 01:26:59.458
Open it up.

01:27:09.875 --> 01:27:10.791
Put him in.

01:27:30.833 --> 01:27:32.083
Good.

01:27:32.166 --> 01:27:33.041
-Daddy!
-Mina!

01:27:33.125 --> 01:27:35.750
Mina, I'm so sorry.

01:27:39.458 --> 01:27:40.291
Hey!

01:27:40.375 --> 01:27:42.708
No time for a little chat?

01:27:47.541 --> 01:27:50.166
Mina, listen to me.

01:27:50.250 --> 01:27:51.333
Listen, okay?

01:27:52.250 --> 01:27:54.166
Get into that car over there.

01:27:54.250 --> 01:27:56.166
Daddy will join you soon, okay?

01:27:56.791 --> 01:27:58.208
Ready, go!

01:28:29.250 --> 01:28:31.875
If I don't return in one piece,

01:28:32.666 --> 01:28:34.875
the media will get
a copy of your indictment.

01:28:36.541 --> 01:28:38.416
I've arranged it with the Senba boss.

01:28:44.083 --> 01:28:45.333
I've given you the body.

01:28:46.083 --> 01:28:49.625
I don't want anything more
to do with this now.

01:29:17.208 --> 01:29:18.708
What now?

01:29:18.791 --> 01:29:22.250
I was right. You and I are the same.

01:29:22.875 --> 01:29:24.000
What?

01:29:24.083 --> 01:29:27.250
What's the point of being a detective
in a town like this?

01:29:27.333 --> 01:29:28.166
What?

01:29:28.666 --> 01:29:31.625
Dragged around by whatever's
in front of you, day after day,

01:29:31.708 --> 01:29:33.500
with only pennies to show for it.

01:29:33.583 --> 01:29:35.583
Is that how you want to live your life?

01:29:38.208 --> 01:29:39.166
Come on, Kudo.

01:29:42.708 --> 01:29:43.750
Join me.

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:47.333
You'll be rich.

01:29:49.083 --> 01:29:51.333
If you have money, you can do anything.

01:29:52.375 --> 01:29:53.208
Well?

01:29:59.250 --> 01:30:00.083
Go to hell.

01:30:00.708 --> 01:30:01.708
What?

01:31:00.666 --> 01:31:01.916
-Mina!
-Mommy!

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:02.916
Mina!

01:31:04.833 --> 01:31:05.833
Mina!

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:09.291
I'm so relieved.

01:31:14.125 --> 01:31:15.916
I'm so glad you're safe.

01:31:23.791 --> 01:31:25.833
Mina and I are leaving this town.

01:31:26.958 --> 01:31:28.625
We can't be here any longer.

01:31:35.666 --> 01:31:36.583
Okay.

01:31:44.791 --> 01:31:47.458
What are you going to do now?

01:31:55.166 --> 01:31:57.500
There's a lizard that lives in the desert.

01:31:59.875 --> 01:32:00.708
What?

01:32:02.083 --> 01:32:04.208
The sand on the ground is hot,

01:32:05.666 --> 01:32:08.083
so it hops from one leg to the other

01:32:09.125 --> 01:32:12.291
while staying in the same place
on the sand.

01:32:16.750 --> 01:32:19.083
Better to go somewhere else, surely.

01:32:20.041 --> 01:32:21.750
But it doesn't leave.

01:32:26.166 --> 01:32:30.208
It just keeps hopping
from one leg to the other.

01:32:34.333 --> 01:32:36.458
It doesn't leave the desert.

01:32:47.125 --> 01:32:51.208
I'm sorry I couldn't make you happy.

01:33:43.416 --> 01:33:45.250
This year was full-on.

01:33:45.333 --> 01:33:47.291
Yeah. We got through it though.

01:34:14.666 --> 01:34:17.666
GOOD LUCK CHARM

01:36:00.041 --> 01:36:01.916
Please come forward slowly.

01:36:05.958 --> 01:36:06.791
It's snowing.

01:36:07.291 --> 01:36:08.125
Wow.

01:36:09.375 --> 01:36:12.083
-Snow?
-Hey, it started snowing!

01:36:14.666 --> 01:36:19.666
Excitement is rising
as the start of the new year approaches.

01:36:20.166 --> 01:36:23.791
How has this year been for you?

01:36:44.291 --> 01:36:47.791
"If you have money, you can do anything."

01:41:59.166 --> 01:42:00.500
Ready, andâ€¦

01:42:35.541 --> 01:42:38.541
The countdown has started.

01:42:38.625 --> 01:42:41.541
-Ten, nine, eightâ€¦
-Just a few moments until the new year.

01:42:41.625 --> 01:42:44.333
â€¦seven, six,

01:42:44.416 --> 01:42:47.375
five, four, three,

01:42:47.916 --> 01:42:48.791
twoâ€¦

01:43:04.875 --> 01:43:07.875
It's the start of a new year.

01:43:09.125 --> 01:43:10.833
Happy New Year to you all!

01:43:43.708 --> 01:43:45.333
Sorry, Kudo.

01:43:46.750 --> 01:43:51.833
It was me who tipped off
the tabloids about the bribes.

01:43:53.750 --> 01:43:59.041
This world didn't leave us enough money
to pass on to the next generation.

01:43:59.708 --> 01:44:00.750
But it's all right.

01:44:01.291 --> 01:44:03.250
Now we're loaded.

01:44:03.333 --> 01:44:04.791
All thanks to you both.

01:44:07.958 --> 01:44:11.416
So there were two desert lizards
who writhed around

01:44:12.083 --> 01:44:15.625
and ended up dying from the heat.

01:44:18.041 --> 01:44:19.833
Get the money out.

01:44:53.625 --> 01:44:57.458
WHAT WILL THE NEW YEAR BRING?

01:44:58.958 --> 01:45:01.541
How do you feel?
Any New Year's resolutions?

01:47:14.291 --> 01:47:15.166
Hello.

01:47:17.875 --> 01:47:18.958
Were you sleeping?

01:47:21.958 --> 01:47:23.000
What's the matter?

01:47:24.708 --> 01:47:25.583
Nothing.

01:47:28.375 --> 01:47:30.541
Just wanted to have a proper chat.

01:47:33.333 --> 01:47:34.250
What is it?

01:47:39.500 --> 01:47:41.166
Are you really leaving?

01:47:47.541 --> 01:47:48.416
Hey.

01:47:51.750 --> 01:47:54.000
Can't we give it one more go?

01:48:02.583 --> 01:48:04.041
How can you say that?

01:48:06.125 --> 01:48:07.000
Incredible.

01:48:10.541 --> 01:48:11.625
I have a feelingâ€¦

01:48:15.458 --> 01:48:17.875
that this is going to be a good year.

01:48:20.708 --> 01:48:23.166
Last year really sucked.

01:48:26.166 --> 01:48:29.500
But I think this year will be better.

01:48:39.458 --> 01:48:43.375
You say that every year.

01:48:53.125 --> 01:48:54.125
Oh, right.

01:48:55.625 --> 01:48:57.166
Is it Daddy?

01:48:58.125 --> 01:48:58.958
Yeah.

01:49:01.125 --> 01:49:03.666
Daddy, come back home soon!

01:49:06.041 --> 01:49:07.166
You heard her.

01:49:09.083 --> 01:49:12.291
Just come home soon.

01:49:16.500 --> 01:49:17.333
Yeah.

01:49:19.875 --> 01:49:20.708
Okay.

01:51:47.250 --> 01:51:50.625
HARD DAYS

01:52:26.083 --> 01:52:27.333
Sorry! I'm sorry!

01:52:29.916 --> 01:52:32.708
I'll pay you properly. This month.

01:52:33.458 --> 01:52:34.833
I swear! Please!

01:52:40.291 --> 01:52:41.666
Somebody, help!

01:52:49.500 --> 01:52:51.166
I'll pay you. I'm sorry.

01:52:54.125 --> 01:52:55.166
Hey, kid.

01:52:57.041 --> 01:52:59.125
Do you want to get out of the desert?

01:53:02.125 --> 01:53:03.166
What?

01:57:11.250 --> 01:57:16.833
