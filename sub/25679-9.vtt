Previously on
"Love &amp; Hip Hop: Hollywood"...

00:05.138 --> 00:06.639
{\an8}(JayWill)
I got to go audition.

00:06.705 --> 00:08.475
{\an7}For what?

00:06.705 --> 00:08.475
{\an9}PRIDE.

00:08.541 --> 00:09.642
{\an8}(woman)
Where's Kandie?

00:09.709 --> 00:11.077
{\an7}I want to try
something different.

00:11.144 --> 00:13.480
{\an8}I'm a fan of your talent,
with or without Kandie.

00:13.546 --> 00:14.948
{\an8}(Ray)
You know I love you,

00:15.014 --> 00:16.216
{\an8}but if you're on the flyer,

00:16.282 --> 00:18.118
{\an8}they're gonna be looking
for, you know, the wig.

00:18.184 --> 00:19.185
{\an7}I'm not doing it
as Kandie.

00:19.252 --> 00:21.988
{\an7}I don't think
the button's there.

00:22.055 --> 00:25.291
{\an8}I'm trying to get her
any feedback.

00:25.358 --> 00:27.227
{\an8}Oh, (bleep)!

00:27.293 --> 00:29.963
{\an8}(man)
Let's make some noise
for Amber Diamond.

00:30.029 --> 00:32.064
{\an8}(cheering and applause)

00:32.131 --> 00:35.235
{\an7}For $20,000, (bleep),
that (bleep) is bull(bleep).

00:35.301 --> 00:38.037
{\an8}Why don't you press play
on Amber's vocals

00:38.104 --> 00:39.672
{\an8}before I did
surgery to 'em?

00:39.739 --> 00:41.107
{\an7}(bleep)

00:41.174 --> 00:42.842
{\an8}(Brooke)
I ran into Akbar
about a month ago

00:42.909 --> 00:43.910
{\an8}with this chick.

00:43.977 --> 00:45.345
{\an7}So it gotta be
this girl right here.

00:45.412 --> 00:47.113
{\an8}No, she not even
that color.

00:47.180 --> 00:49.449
{\an8}(Paris)
Anything you wanna do from here,
I'm with you.

00:49.516 --> 00:51.851
{\an7}(woman)
Anybody that wants to deal
with Akbar

00:51.918 --> 00:53.219
{\an7}is gonna have to
go through me.

00:53.286 --> 00:55.255
{\an7}You are going to have
your own understanding.

00:55.321 --> 00:56.389
{\an9}(Teairra)
I'm out.

00:56.456 --> 00:59.159
{\an8}(Paris)
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh!

00:59.225 --> 01:01.761
{\an8}(woman)
Teairra Mari--
somebody uploaded porn of her.

01:01.828 --> 01:03.763
{\an8}(woman)
It is very unfortunate.

01:03.830 --> 01:06.132
{\an7}I didn't know us
investigating this (bleep)

01:06.199 --> 01:07.434
{\an8}was gonna get to this level.

01:07.500 --> 01:08.501
{\an7}(Teairra)
I met with a lawyer.

01:08.568 --> 01:11.037
{\an7}She wants to do
a press conference.

01:11.104 --> 01:12.839
{\an8}I'm obviously out of
this situation.

01:12.906 --> 01:15.875
{\an7}All my (bleep) real friends
better be there.

{\an8}(Teairra)
The past week of my life
has been crazy.

01:53.446 --> 01:56.749
{\an8}My boyfriend had an alleged wife
and a girlfriend

01:56.816 --> 01:58.518
and exposed me to the world.

01:58.585 --> 02:00.253
But he was a man that I loved,

02:00.320 --> 02:03.423
and with all the heartbreak,
I went back hoping

02:03.490 --> 02:05.592
that he did not
leak those sex tapes.

02:05.658 --> 02:07.794
Queen Marie, in the flesh.

02:07.861 --> 02:08.995
{\an4}Hi, girl.

02:07.861 --> 02:08.995
{\an3}Hi, girl.

02:09.062 --> 02:10.263
(Teairra)
I'm so embarrassed,

02:10.330 --> 02:11.764
I've been hiding
from the public.

02:11.831 --> 02:13.500
But Brooke
reached out and told me

02:13.566 --> 02:16.569
that she might have
some intel on Mr. Akbar

02:16.636 --> 02:17.937
that I might wanna know.

02:18.004 --> 02:19.572
Before you hear it
from anybody else,

02:19.639 --> 02:20.940
woman to woman,

02:21.007 --> 02:24.110
I've been knowing Akbar
for a couple of years,

02:24.177 --> 02:26.346
{\an8}and I met him
on some girl-meets-boy

02:26.412 --> 02:27.547
{\an8}in the grocery store.

02:27.614 --> 02:28.982
I was with my mom and my son.

02:29.048 --> 02:31.050
He is so charismatic.

02:31.117 --> 02:32.585
"How you doin', Mom?"

02:32.652 --> 02:35.688
Rubbing on my son's curls
and I'm like, "Whoa."

02:35.755 --> 02:37.724
I thought I curved him
and went on with my life.

02:37.790 --> 02:39.993
Every six months, one of
my homegirls will be like,

02:40.059 --> 02:41.928
"I just met a guy
at the grocery store,

02:41.995 --> 02:44.163
he got green eyes,
he drive a wagon."

02:44.230 --> 02:47.000
And I'm like, "Akbar?"

02:47.066 --> 02:48.334
I'm sure
that's kinda the way

02:48.401 --> 02:50.336
he woos you
into the situation.

02:50.403 --> 02:52.906
{\an1}The thing about it is, I was
just getting out of rehab,

02:52.972 --> 02:55.608
{\an1}and I told myself,
"Know yourself

02:55.675 --> 02:59.379
{\an5}before you get into any
situation with any man."

02:55.675 --> 02:59.379
I'm talking about
just the girls here.

02:59.445 --> 03:01.614
You're very well-known.

03:01.681 --> 03:03.416
He knew you was
getting out of rehab.

03:03.483 --> 03:04.918
Your business was kinda
out there, sister.

03:04.984 --> 03:06.085
{\an1}Right.

03:06.152 --> 03:07.787
I think he wanted
to be popping.

03:07.854 --> 03:09.422
He used you.

03:09.489 --> 03:10.857
I don't wanna offend you
or nothing but...

03:10.924 --> 03:12.458
the stuff
that's in social media,

03:12.525 --> 03:14.761
with you in the bed after
the situation happened,

03:14.827 --> 03:16.362
it's looking like
a publicity stunt.

03:23.836 --> 03:25.238
{\an5}(Brooke)
What really
got my head messed up

03:25.305 --> 03:28.074
is the fact that she's still
kicking it with Akbar.

03:28.141 --> 03:29.475
Let's not all pretend

03:29.542 --> 03:32.245
that Teairra didn't have
an amazing start to her career.

03:32.312 --> 03:34.480
That was over
a decade ago, though.

03:34.547 --> 03:37.817
So to be back in the industry
with a sex tape?

03:37.884 --> 03:40.119
I'm wondering,
what's going on, sis?

03:40.186 --> 03:42.021
Is somebody trying
to be relevant?

03:42.088 --> 03:43.823
I'm seeing you in the bed,
y'all still talking.

03:43.890 --> 03:47.727
I'm like, "Uh, Teairra?"

03:47.794 --> 03:51.531
{\an1}After the sex tape came out,
yes, I was at his house,

03:51.598 --> 03:53.433
{\an1}because I was still confused,
I was still--

03:53.499 --> 03:56.035
{\an6}Right.

03:53.499 --> 03:56.035
--in love in, in my own mind.

03:56.102 --> 03:59.005
{\an1}I wanted answers, like,
"Look me in my face, baby.

03:59.072 --> 04:00.406
{\an5}Tell me the truth."

03:59.072 --> 04:00.406
{\an3}Yeah.

04:00.473 --> 04:01.574
And he still was lying.

04:01.641 --> 04:03.443
At the end of the day,

04:03.509 --> 04:05.244
{\an1}you forced my hand
at this point

04:05.311 --> 04:09.449
{\an1}and, um...
I'm suing (bleep)boy.

04:09.515 --> 04:13.019
You wanna play with me, I'm
gonna mother(bleep) do you.

04:13.086 --> 04:15.288
{\an5}So what's up? What's up?

04:13.086 --> 04:15.288
But you really wanna
press this...

04:15.355 --> 04:17.156
{\an5}This is what you
feel in your heart?

04:15.355 --> 04:17.156
Absomother(bleep)lutely.

04:17.223 --> 04:19.492
{\an1}If I didn't,
it would look like I did it.

04:19.559 --> 04:20.892
And I did not do it.

04:20.959 --> 04:24.731
I know how crazy it was
to see me with Akbar

04:24.797 --> 04:26.532
after the sex tape was leaked,

04:26.599 --> 04:28.901
but I have to go forth
with this lawsuit

04:28.968 --> 04:31.070
in defense of my credibility.

04:31.137 --> 04:32.672
I'm gonna tell
another thing.

04:32.739 --> 04:34.073
{\an1}I got a press conference
coming up.

04:34.140 --> 04:36.042
Girl... that's heavy.

04:36.109 --> 04:39.112
{\an1}But Paris, she told me that she
wouldn't be able to make it

04:39.178 --> 04:43.082
{\an4}because she doesn't like to get
into law matters or whatever.

04:39.178 --> 04:43.082
{\an3}Mm...

04:43.149 --> 04:46.552
{\an1}So I texted Nikki
to see if she would be there.

04:46.619 --> 04:48.655
She hasn't responded yet.

04:48.721 --> 04:51.224
{\an1}I'm disappointed
because, you know,

04:51.290 --> 04:53.459
{\an1}she was in my business
from day one.

04:53.526 --> 04:55.094
{\an1}Even when I didn't
want her to be.

04:55.161 --> 04:57.430
For me, even speaking on you
and saying your name to Paris

04:57.497 --> 04:59.532
{\an1}and having a whole
conversation about your life--

04:59.599 --> 05:01.668
{\an4}I get it.

04:59.599 --> 05:01.668
--it went crazy.

05:01.734 --> 05:03.636
I feel like I played
a role in this.

05:03.703 --> 05:05.905
If you wouldn't mind,

05:05.972 --> 05:07.573
I would like to be there
for you and support you,

05:07.640 --> 05:09.709

05:11.577 --> 05:13.179
Yeah. I'm coming, girl.

I'm shooting a video today
with Marques Anthony.

05:42.909 --> 05:45.745
{\an8}He has some background for
Jamie Foxx and Kelly Rowland,

05:45.812 --> 05:49.115
and let me tell you,
he lookin' like a whole snack.

05:49.182 --> 05:50.483
But I know
he's Roccstar's friend,

05:50.550 --> 05:52.719
so I gotta keep my distance
from him.

05:52.785 --> 05:54.087
{\an5}You big time now.

05:56.656 --> 05:58.691
Why don't you
come work with me?

05:58.758 --> 05:59.826

business, though.

05:59.892 --> 06:00.927
{\an5}It is business.

05:59.892 --> 06:00.927
All business.

06:00.993 --> 06:02.061
{\an1}I gotta take care
of business.

06:02.128 --> 06:03.396
I'll be right back.

06:03.463 --> 06:05.631
{\an1}Uh-huh.
Hey, you.

06:05.698 --> 06:07.967
{\an5}That's right, girl.

06:05.698 --> 06:07.967
{\an1}Yes.

06:08.034 --> 06:10.470
{\an5}(Amber)
Me and Apple have shot
a lot of videos together

06:10.536 --> 06:13.473
and we became really good
friends after that.

06:13.539 --> 06:15.908
{\an8}Of course I still wanna make
a living doing my music thing,

06:15.975 --> 06:17.810
{\an8}but until then,
doing music videos

06:17.877 --> 06:19.412
{\an8}and hanging out
with my girl Apple

06:19.479 --> 06:21.681
is a fun way to make some cash.

06:21.748 --> 06:22.749
What are y'all doing?

06:22.815 --> 06:23.816
Okay, yeah, we flirting.

06:23.883 --> 06:25.585
Sexy talk too.

06:25.651 --> 06:27.720
{\an1}I'ma work with him but I'm
focused on my music, though.

06:27.787 --> 06:29.222
{\an4}Okay.

06:27.787 --> 06:29.222
Like, that's what I'm
focused on right now.

06:29.288 --> 06:30.289
{\an1}Yeah.

06:29.288 --> 06:30.289
You feel me?

06:30.356 --> 06:31.524
Well, speaking of doing music,

06:31.591 --> 06:32.825
{\an1}I heard y'all
talking about Roccstar?

06:32.892 --> 06:34.260
But he petty
as a mother(bleep).

06:34.327 --> 06:36.796
{\an4}Let me tell you what
this (bleep) did to me.

06:34.327 --> 06:36.796
{\an3}What?

06:36.863 --> 06:39.398
{\an4}So, I introduced him to my mom,
my mom's a manager--

06:36.863 --> 06:39.398
{\an3}Uh-huh.

06:39.465 --> 06:41.267
{\an1}--and, um,
my mom gave him 20 bands.

06:41.334 --> 06:43.469
{\an6}20 bands?

06:41.334 --> 06:43.469
Yes, 20 bands for him
to give me a single.

06:43.536 --> 06:45.638
{\an1}We decided to have
a single release party.

06:45.705 --> 06:46.706
Bitch... (sighs)

06:46.773 --> 06:47.907
What happened?

06:47.974 --> 06:50.042
{\an1}My mom decides that she
don't like the song,

06:50.109 --> 06:53.079
{\an4}so she stops the song in front
of the whole party.

06:50.109 --> 06:53.079
In front of the whole party.

06:53.146 --> 06:55.448
{\an1}The whole crowd,
and then here go Roccstar.

06:55.515 --> 06:57.517
{\an1}"Let me show you
how it sounded before me."

06:57.583 --> 07:00.686
{\an5}The mother(bleep)
played my vocals--

06:57.583 --> 07:00.686
Are you serious?

07:00.753 --> 07:03.756
{\an5}--without the editing.

07:00.753 --> 07:03.756
I woulda went HAM.
Are you serious?

07:03.823 --> 07:06.359
But, ah, girl...

07:06.425 --> 07:07.727
your mother give you
20 bands

07:07.794 --> 07:09.829
just to help you out
for your own career, girl,

07:09.896 --> 07:12.031
you lucky, because
there's people like me

07:12.098 --> 07:13.733

you feel me?

07:13.800 --> 07:14.934
That's fending for their own.

07:15.001 --> 07:17.670
See, I'm looking
for a manager right now,

07:17.737 --> 07:18.905
I'm trying to get
my music up.

07:18.971 --> 07:20.640
Well, you know...

07:18.971 --> 07:20.640
{\an3}What?

07:20.706 --> 07:23.876
We ain't talking right now
but she's a good manager.

07:23.943 --> 07:26.846
{\an1}She's worked with 2 Chainz
and Future, Lil' Wayne,

07:26.913 --> 07:28.748
{\an5}a whole bunch of people.

07:26.913 --> 07:28.748
{\an1}Sounds like she got
a big-ass background.

07:28.815 --> 07:30.416
{\an1}Yeah, so she could
really help you.

A1 is a good guy by helping me
do my one little song,

really could get me some gigs.

or something, or how...?

know each other that well,

09:01.707 --> 09:03.776

are getting to know each other,

09:06.112 --> 09:08.314
I am desperate to see
what Moniece thinks

09:08.381 --> 09:09.782
about this whole scandal,

09:09.849 --> 09:11.217
especially with Nikki and Paris

09:11.284 --> 09:13.085
kicking Teairra's friendship
to the curb.

09:13.152 --> 09:15.187
{\an1}So, Miss Teairra's
been busy.

09:15.254 --> 09:16.656
Your friend, right?

09:16.722 --> 09:20.493
{\an8}That is my friend, but we
haven't spoken in a while.

09:20.559 --> 09:22.728
I have a hard time believing

09:22.795 --> 09:24.697
that anybody would just
put their own images out,

09:24.764 --> 09:26.565
but these days,
you never know.

09:26.632 --> 09:28.734
{\an1}She says she's doing
a press conference, girl.

09:28.801 --> 09:30.770
{\an1}I told her I'm gonna be there
to support her

09:30.836 --> 09:32.104
{\an1}'cause she says she's having
issues with Paris,

09:32.171 --> 09:33.673
she have issues with Nikki,

09:33.739 --> 09:35.441
{\an4}she don't know if Nikki's
gonna be there for her.

09:33.739 --> 09:35.441
{\an3}Well...

09:35.508 --> 09:38.978
I just don't think Nikki
knows how to love Teairra

09:39.045 --> 09:40.212
the way Teairra loves Nikki.

09:40.279 --> 09:41.480
That's why I'm thinking

09:41.547 --> 09:43.649
{\an1}you should come to
the press conference with me.

09:43.716 --> 09:45.518
I'll think about it.
I'll think about it.

09:45.584 --> 09:46.786
{\an5}This will be--

09:45.584 --> 09:46.786
I definitely want to
support her,

09:46.852 --> 09:48.487
but you have to
understand my position.

09:48.554 --> 09:52.158
{\an1}Like, last year she accused me
of meddling in her business.

09:52.224 --> 09:53.993
I backed up, and now for me

09:54.060 --> 09:55.528
to just pop up at a press
conference, like...

09:55.594 --> 09:57.229

10:03.736 --> 10:05.671

London is like my second home.

10:22.555 --> 10:25.324
Every time I put out new music,
I go over there, I perform.

10:25.391 --> 10:27.994
Everybody in the UK makes me
feel like I'm the queen.

10:28.060 --> 10:30.830
{\an1}She set me up in this
massive eight-bedroom flat.

10:30.896 --> 10:31.998
{\an4}Huge.

10:30.896 --> 10:31.998
{\an3}Okay...

10:32.064 --> 10:33.232

10:33.299 --> 10:34.800

10:34.867 --> 10:36.569

10:36.635 --> 10:38.270

10:38.337 --> 10:39.739
{\an5}You said "we."

10:38.337 --> 10:39.739
{\an1}Uh-oh.

10:39.805 --> 10:41.807
(Bridget)
Hear me out, hear me out.

10:41.874 --> 10:43.776
I want it to be
a ladies' trip.

10:43.843 --> 10:45.745
Just to disconnect
from everybody.

10:45.811 --> 10:47.847
{\an1}It sounds good.

10:47.913 --> 10:50.082
{\an1}You might need
a break from this.

10:50.149 --> 10:52.885
I would love a break from
the Hollywood shenanigans.

10:52.952 --> 10:54.553

Moniece invited me
to Bridget's performance

11:20.079 --> 11:23.115
{\an8}and I didn't wanna bail on her,

11:23.182 --> 11:24.617
but I ain't been
feeling too social

11:24.683 --> 11:27.853
ever since Misster Ray
and his wack-ass judges

11:27.920 --> 11:29.088
passed judgment on me.

11:29.155 --> 11:31.290
And even worse,
I heard yesterday

11:31.357 --> 11:32.825
they gave La'Britney the gig.

11:32.892 --> 11:36.062
She don't even have as many
followers as JayWill or Kandie.

11:36.128 --> 11:37.730
What's going on?

11:37.797 --> 11:41.867
You came in like...
the angry boyfriend.

11:41.934 --> 11:43.836
{\an1}I did what you
suggested me to do.

11:43.903 --> 11:46.072
{\an1}I humbled myself
to audition for L.A. PRIDE.

11:46.138 --> 11:47.506
{\an3}As JayWill.

11:47.573 --> 11:50.242
{\an1}Not only that, by myself,
I invited La'Britney to go,

11:50.309 --> 11:51.744
and Misster Ray, he was...

11:51.811 --> 11:54.680
{\an1}there was some real, like,
"Oh, we want Kandie,"

11:54.747 --> 11:56.615
{\an1}and I'm like,
"Okay, that's cool."

11:56.682 --> 11:59.385
{\an1}They started comparing me
to La'Britney.

11:59.452 --> 12:00.486
"You shoulda been
like La'Britney,

12:00.553 --> 12:01.620
{\an1}out here
booty-droppin' everywhere."

12:01.687 --> 12:03.556
Well, if she were
a real friend,

12:03.622 --> 12:05.191
she would either
not do the showcase

12:05.257 --> 12:06.492
or she definitely
would check in

12:06.559 --> 12:08.027
to see if that's
okay with you.

12:08.094 --> 12:10.629
I just know that I've
never really heard

12:10.696 --> 12:12.932
anything great about her.

12:12.998 --> 12:17.036
{\an1}I mean, Lyrica told me she was,
like, sliding in A1's DMs

12:17.103 --> 12:18.938
and trying to hang out
with him.

12:19.004 --> 12:21.474
{\an1}And then I heard from
somebody else they had sex.

12:21.540 --> 12:22.741
Have a chitchat with her.

12:22.808 --> 12:24.343
I see somebody over there

have a chitchat with.

12:54.373 --> 12:55.608

a little strange.

{\an1}and together with
my co-counsel Walter Mosely,

14:32.972 --> 14:36.575
I'm very pleased and honored
to represent Teairra Marie.

14:36.642 --> 14:38.110
We're filing a lawsuit today

14:38.177 --> 14:40.679
{\an1}against a man
who we believe is responsible

14:40.746 --> 14:42.548
for the revenge porn posts.

14:42.615 --> 14:45.751
{\an1}Revenge porn is
the non-consensual posting

14:45.818 --> 14:47.620
of sexually explicit images.

14:47.686 --> 14:50.155
{\an7}It's usually done
by a man against a woman

14:50.222 --> 14:52.091
to dominate and control her.

14:59.698 --> 15:02.935
{\an8}(Brooke)
Teairra pressing charges
is very courageous,

15:03.002 --> 15:04.770
{\an8}but hold up.

15:04.837 --> 15:07.806
{\an8}I cannot believe
my eyes and ears right now.

15:07.873 --> 15:11.343
I'm pretty sure I just walked
past Akbar's Jujitsu Barbie

15:11.410 --> 15:13.512
talking about, "I did it."

15:13.579 --> 15:14.913
{\an1}Thank you all
for coming today,

15:14.980 --> 15:17.049
{\an1}and Teairra,
whenever you're ready.

15:17.116 --> 15:19.518
I just want you all to know
if I stumble,

15:19.585 --> 15:23.355
it's because
I'm very nerve-racked.

15:23.422 --> 15:24.990
Um...

15:25.057 --> 15:27.926
Last week I found out that
my boyfriend, Akbar that is,

15:27.993 --> 15:32.531
posted on my Instagram
a sex tape and...

15:32.598 --> 15:35.934
(sighs)
...an obscene... photo of me.

15:37.536 --> 15:40.139
I'm shaking, guys,
I'm sorry.

15:40.205 --> 15:41.840
{\an5}Take your time.

15:40.205 --> 15:41.840
You're doing great.

15:41.907 --> 15:43.175
Okay.

15:43.242 --> 15:45.878
I stand here
in the pursuit of justice.

15:45.944 --> 15:51.383
Not just for myself
but for any other woman

15:51.450 --> 15:53.719
who has been exploited
by a man.

15:53.786 --> 15:56.088
Who has felt the pain

15:56.155 --> 15:58.657
of having
her most intimate moments

15:58.724 --> 16:02.861
unjustly and illegally
exposed to the public.

16:02.928 --> 16:06.465
I ask that the court
take my plea seriously

16:06.532 --> 16:09.535
<i>and that my rights as a woman</i>
<i>under the revenge porn laws--</i>

16:09.601 --> 16:11.870

16:11.937 --> 16:13.005

16:13.072 --> 16:14.773

16:14.840 --> 16:15.908

16:15.974 --> 16:17.676
{\an8}Why you didn't
go there for her?

16:17.743 --> 16:19.178
{\an7}I don't do legal (bleep).
I'm not that friend.

16:19.244 --> 16:22.147
{\an1}I'll ride out with you,
and I explained it to her.

16:22.214 --> 16:24.283
{\an1}And I feel like
she's still in love.

16:24.350 --> 16:25.751
{\an1}I don't think
it's over for them.

16:25.818 --> 16:27.286
You said you saw her back
at his house after, right?

16:27.353 --> 16:29.688
{\an4}Yeah, she had posted something
laying in his bed.

16:27.353 --> 16:29.688
{\an3}Hmm...

16:29.755 --> 16:32.524
{\an7}If somebody do that to me,
I, I, I can't say...

16:32.591 --> 16:34.059
{\an7}I'm not laying in their bed
the same night.

16:34.126 --> 16:35.260
Like, come on now.

16:35.327 --> 16:37.663
{\an1}This right here,
I hope and pray she's done.

16:37.730 --> 16:39.365
I don't wanna be
wrapped up in a lawsuit

16:39.431 --> 16:40.632
that has nothing to do
with me.

16:40.699 --> 16:42.234
You know,
I have to think about me

16:42.301 --> 16:44.503
and the bigger picture.

16:44.570 --> 16:47.172
{\an1}Teairra pissed off, so...
be ready.

16:47.239 --> 16:48.774
Let's continue watching it.

16:48.841 --> 16:51.176
{\an5}(Bloom)
<i>Does anybody have</i>
<i>any questions?</i>

16:54.780 --> 16:56.348
I'm just devastated.

16:56.415 --> 16:57.416
I'm heartbroken.

16:57.483 --> 16:59.118
I loved this man.

16:59.184 --> 17:00.486
(cameras clicking)

17:00.552 --> 17:02.988
He's saying
that he didn't do it.

17:03.055 --> 17:06.090
And even though
I want to believe the lies,

17:06.157 --> 17:09.795
I have to just stand up
for myself or it looks like...

17:09.862 --> 17:11.329
I did it.

17:11.396 --> 17:14.333
<i>That's why I'm going</i>
<i>full pursuit with this lawsuit.</i>

17:14.400 --> 17:15.666
(Bloom)
<i>Thank you, everyone.</i>

17:15.733 --> 17:17.368
This is crazy.

17:17.435 --> 17:18.737
What you think?

17:18.804 --> 17:21.807
{\an8}I feel bad for her, but...

17:21.874 --> 17:23.142
{\an7}there's some things
don't really...

17:23.208 --> 17:24.910
(together)
...add up.

17:24.977 --> 17:27.212
Like, watching Mimi
playing the victim

17:27.279 --> 17:29.748
after the sex tape came out.

17:29.815 --> 17:33.519
{\an8}It just feels a lot like
the whole Atlanta scandal.

17:33.585 --> 17:37.055
{\an8}Bad boyfriend, and we gonna
get the money for this

17:37.122 --> 17:40.192
{\an8}'cause we wanna do
the Kim K/Ray J thing.

17:40.259 --> 17:43.662
{\an8}Fame is the worst drug
known to man.

17:43.729 --> 17:47.766
{\an1}Her dude, Akbar, DM'd me, 'cause
I was looking for a studio.

17:47.833 --> 17:49.868
{\an6}No!

17:47.833 --> 17:49.868
{\an1}We're supposed
to meet up to talk,

17:49.935 --> 17:51.804
{\an5}you know, about getting
in the studio, whatever.

17:49.935 --> 17:51.804
{\an3}Right.

17:51.870 --> 17:53.705
{\an1}But now...

17:53.772 --> 17:57.509
{\an1}It make me nervous but it
also make me a little nosy.

17:57.576 --> 17:59.545
{\an5}(Teairra)
I just wanted to thank
you guys, though.

17:59.611 --> 18:01.413
Seeing familiar faces--

18:01.480 --> 18:03.215
{\an5}Yeah.

18:01.480 --> 18:03.215
--even though we don't
know each other like that,

18:03.282 --> 18:04.516

18:04.583 --> 18:05.884
Well, I was hesitant to come

18:05.951 --> 18:08.587
{\an1}after, like, everything
we've been through last year,

18:08.654 --> 18:10.189
but I was like... (sighs)

18:10.255 --> 18:11.857
{\an5}This shows...

18:10.255 --> 18:11.857
...you're right.

18:11.924 --> 18:14.860
{\an4}'Cause I still love you,
you're my family.

18:11.924 --> 18:14.860
This shows what it is.

18:14.927 --> 18:15.961
{\an1}Yeah.

18:16.028 --> 18:18.530
I was real shocked
to see, um,

Akbar's girlfriend,
Jujitsu-- thing two.

18:21.767 --> 18:23.735

18:21.767 --> 18:23.735
Are you (bleep) kidding me?

18:23.802 --> 18:25.737
She said that she did this.

18:25.804 --> 18:27.306
They will do anything
for this man.

18:27.372 --> 18:29.141
{\an1}First of all,
she didn't do that (bleep).

18:29.208 --> 18:30.209
{\an3}He did it.

18:30.275 --> 18:31.510
If she wants to take blame,

the blogs have been on fire.

19:13.218 --> 19:15.687

Sidebar: where the (bleep)

19:26.598 --> 19:28.667
{\an1}I talked to Paris,

19:28.734 --> 19:30.802
{\an1}why she wasn't gonna
be there,

19:30.869 --> 19:31.870

{\an1}And she kind of was just
like, "I can't come."

19:40.112 --> 19:42.314
I also feel some type of way
about Nikki

19:42.381 --> 19:44.650
{\an5}when you wanna talk
about sincerity...

19:42.381 --> 19:44.650
{\an3}Ooh.

19:44.716 --> 19:46.552
{\an5}And pure intent.

19:44.716 --> 19:46.552
{\an1}Well...

19:46.618 --> 19:48.720
{\an8}I've never gotten
that vibe from her.

19:48.787 --> 19:50.455
Can I be optimistic
a little bit?

19:50.522 --> 19:53.292
{\an5}Yeah, of course.

19:50.522 --> 19:53.292
Maybe because you said
you were done before,

19:53.358 --> 19:55.827
maybe she didn't think you
were really done this time,

19:55.894 --> 19:58.297
{\an1}so she's like, "Girl, I'm not
going into this battle with you

19:58.363 --> 19:59.665
if you don't even wanna
really fight it."

19:59.731 --> 20:01.733
{\an1}Okay, but she had
the same situation.

29:31.169 --> 29:32.871
{\an1}I realized you
called me selfish too.

29:32.937 --> 29:34.539
{\an5}I'm gonna sit over here
with you.

29:32.937 --> 29:34.539
It is because

29:34.606 --> 29:37.375
my dad was sick, Teairra,
so that's how I feel.

29:37.442 --> 29:39.511
{\an1}I was there for you when my mom
was going through (bleep).

29:39.577 --> 29:42.547
{\an1}Your brother died
and I was there for you.

29:42.614 --> 29:44.516
And you weren't for me.

29:47.051 --> 29:50.088
I was in attendance, and
I'm not here to attack you.

29:50.155 --> 29:54.292
All three of us have all
experienced revenge porn.

29:54.359 --> 29:57.729

you want your friends around.

{\an5}I don't want to
ever feel like I'm
insensitive towards you.

30:07.872 --> 30:09.741
You've been there for me
and I think many times

30:09.807 --> 30:11.576
I've been there for you
prior, so you know what?

30:11.643 --> 30:13.611
I apologize if you feel
like I wasn't there

30:13.678 --> 30:15.280
and I didn't get to
explain myself to you.

30:15.346 --> 30:17.549
We both love each other.
I'm not gonna keep

30:17.615 --> 30:19.617

and you know that.

30:19.684 --> 30:22.387
{\an5}You still love her?

30:19.684 --> 30:22.387
{\an1}Yeah. That's not
gonna go away.

30:22.453 --> 30:24.756

You still got the

Goodness, gracious.

{\an1}(whimpering)
This is so crazy.

37:53.504 --> 37:57.475

outside the door.

38:17.261 --> 38:19.196
{\an1}We talking (bleep),

38:19.263 --> 38:21.499
She was about to go

38:21.565 --> 38:25.302
and she knew what
that was gonna lead to.

38:25.369 --> 38:28.172
{\an5}I'm not gonna...
You didn't catch me
doing nothing.

38:28.239 --> 38:29.807
I think you've been
doing a great thing.

39:15.853 --> 39:18.422
They laid her flat.

39:18.489 --> 39:20.991
