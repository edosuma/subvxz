00:07.217 --> 00:07.773
Quill.

00:08.526 --> 00:09.450
Check.

00:10.602 --> 00:11.465
Parchment.

00:11.463 --> 00:12.196
Check.

00:12.195 --> 00:13.020
Extra ink.

00:13.019 --> 00:13.540
Check.

00:13.539 --> 00:14.949
Extra-extra ink.

00:14.946 --> 00:15.871
Check.

00:16.165 --> 00:17.822
Is that everything on the checklist?

00:17.818 --> 00:19.153
-Yep!
-Great.

00:19.151 --> 00:22.485
Now that we've completed the checklist
of things we need to create a checklist...

00:22.475 --> 00:25.937
...we can make my checklist of the things
I have to get done by the end of the day.

00:26.159 --> 00:27.216
Ready?

00:27.370 --> 00:28.400
Ready!

00:28.398 --> 00:32.770
Item 1: Create checklist of the things
I have to accomplish by the end of the day.

01:18.706 --> 01:19.737
How are we doing, Spike?

01:19.984 --> 01:21.120
Let's see...

01:21.118 --> 01:22.910
We've already dropped off
your cape at the cleaner's...

01:22.905 --> 01:24.901
...returned the blackboard
you borrowed from Cheerilee...

01:24.897 --> 01:27.337
...ordered new parchment and quills
from the stationery shop...

01:27.387 --> 01:30.818
Hmm... Seems like we just placed
an order for those a few days ago.

01:32.146 --> 01:34.898
Can imagine why we go
through so many of them.

01:35.106 --> 01:37.944
Sounds like we're ahead
of schedule. What's next?

01:38.400 --> 01:39.936
Cupcakes!

01:44.166 --> 01:46.215
Uh, I only ordered twelve.

01:46.210 --> 01:47.641
Oh, I know, dear.

01:47.637 --> 01:51.244
But I had an extra, so I though
I'd make it a baker's dozen.

01:53.267 --> 01:55.041
Oh, that was very thoughtful of you.

01:55.037 --> 01:57.554
It's just some of the icing
from the extra cupcake...

01:57.547 --> 02:00.440
...is getting all over
the one next to it. See?

02:02.102 --> 02:03.820
Oh! Sure.

02:03.816 --> 02:06.176
It's just that I'm planning on
sharing these at a picnic later...

02:06.170 --> 02:09.726
...and I don't want anypony to feel like
somepony else is getting more icing.

02:10.485 --> 02:13.421
Oh... no, of course not.

02:14.091 --> 02:15.029
Not to worry.

02:15.063 --> 02:17.258
I'll just move some of this one to...

02:17.630 --> 02:20.581
Hmm... I think I may have
scooped too much.

02:20.698 --> 02:22.843
Oops! Now those two have more.

02:23.071 --> 02:24.773
Let's just try this again.

02:26.950 --> 02:29.319
Hmm... No, that won't do.

02:29.587 --> 02:32.626
Let me just... hmm...
put some here, then...

02:41.758 --> 02:42.822
Perfect!

02:43.813 --> 02:46.312
Hmm, oh yes. Much better.

02:46.305 --> 02:49.096
Okay! Time to tackle
the next item on our...

02:49.088 --> 02:50.209
Oops!

02:50.207 --> 02:54.083
Looks like we're gonna have to add
"Give a baby dragon a bath" to our list.

02:57.883 --> 03:01.506
Very efficient! And a little bit gross.

03:03.049 --> 03:04.317
Looks like that's everything.

03:04.503 --> 03:06.226
Almost everything.

03:06.222 --> 03:09.741
"Triple-check checklist to make sure
we didn't miss anything..."

03:09.731 --> 03:12.142
"...when the double-checked
the checklist".

03:12.210 --> 03:13.843
Uh, check.

03:14.827 --> 03:19.164
I've been holding that quill so long
I've got a claw cramp.

03:20.255 --> 03:23.643
Good thing we don't have anything
to report to Princess Celestia this week.

03:23.634 --> 03:25.663
I don't think I can write another word.

03:25.820 --> 03:28.746
We haven't sent a letter
to Princess Celestia this week?!

03:28.738 --> 03:30.349
Why? Is that bad?

03:30.345 --> 03:32.687
Bad?! BAD?! Of course it's bad!

03:32.681 --> 03:35.283
I'm supposed to send Princess
Celestia a letter every week...

03:35.276 --> 03:37.383
...telling her about a lesson
I've learned about friendship!

03:37.378 --> 03:39.759
Not every other week.
Not every ten days.

03:39.752 --> 03:42.085
Every! Single! Week!

03:43.521 --> 03:45.945
Where's my calendar?!
Where's my calendar?!

03:45.938 --> 03:48.332
Where it always is?

03:49.193 --> 03:51.203
When did we send the last one?

03:51.371 --> 03:53.438
Last Tuesday?

03:53.592 --> 03:55.764
And today is...

03:56.283 --> 03:57.262
Tuesday?

03:58.454 --> 04:00.216
Nonononononono...

04:01.751 --> 04:04.193
If I don't send her a letter
by sundown, I'll be...

04:05.011 --> 04:07.056
TARDY!!!

04:07.967 --> 04:09.130
What's that now?

04:09.127 --> 04:12.151
Tar-dy, Spike. Late! I'll be late!

04:12.343 --> 04:15.956
Oh, how could I've let this happen?
I'm usually so organized.

04:15.946 --> 04:17.933
I've never been late for an assignment.

04:17.927 --> 04:20.788
Oh, please! You're the most
studious student ever.

04:20.781 --> 04:24.218
I'm sure the princess will forgive you
if you miss one little deadline.

04:24.208 --> 04:26.312
I'm afraid to take that chance, Spike.

04:26.307 --> 04:29.368
This is the ruler of all of Equestria
we're talking about.

04:29.359 --> 04:31.817
The pony who holds
my fate in her hooves.

04:32.988 --> 04:34.376
What if she doesn't forgive me?

04:34.372 --> 04:36.113
Yeah, I don't think she...

04:36.108 --> 04:37.489
What if instead she starts thinking...

04:37.486 --> 04:40.141
...I'm not taking my studies
on friendship seriously?

04:40.135 --> 04:40.774
Why would she...

04:40.773 --> 04:43.399
What if she makes me come back to
Canterlot and puts me back in school...

04:43.392 --> 04:47.044
...and makes me *prove* I've been
taking them seriously by giving me a task?

04:47.210 --> 04:48.947
What if I don't pass?!

04:48.977 --> 04:51.835
-But why wouldn't you pass...
-She's my teacher!

04:51.828 --> 04:54.905
Do you know what teachers do
to students who don't pass?

04:55.890 --> 04:58.125
THEY SEND THEM BACK A GRADE!

04:58.119 --> 04:59.758
But she won't just send me back a grade.

04:59.754 --> 05:01.493
She'll send me back to...

05:02.032 --> 05:04.065
...magic kindergarten.

05:10.997 --> 05:12.168
Twilight.

05:12.942 --> 05:14.215
Twilight!

05:14.727 --> 05:17.688
That is the most ridiculous
thing I've ever heard!

05:17.680 --> 05:20.626
You're not gonna be sent back
to magic kindergarten.

05:20.617 --> 05:23.634
You're right. I have no reason to worry.

05:23.725 --> 05:25.921
Because I'm going to solve
a friend's problem...

05:25.916 --> 05:29.516
...and get that letter to Princess
Celestia before sundown!

05:30.314 --> 05:31.714
So...

05:31.795 --> 05:34.067
Got any problems, troubles, conundrums
or any other sort of issues...

05:34.062 --> 05:37.667
...major or minor, that I as a good
friend could help you solve?

05:43.066 --> 05:44.434
I got nothin'.

05:46.103 --> 05:49.656
Then it looks like I'm gonna have to
find somepony who does.

05:51.229 --> 05:53.131
This won't end well.

05:57.759 --> 05:59.064
You've got this, Twilight.

05:59.061 --> 06:02.521
You still have plenty of time to
get that letter to Princess Celestia.

06:02.511 --> 06:06.184
Has to be somepony around here
who needs the help of a good friend.

06:07.572 --> 06:08.855
Rarity!

06:12.254 --> 06:15.394
Don't worry, Rarity! I'm here!

06:15.499 --> 06:17.989
Why me?

06:17.983 --> 06:20.964
WHY, WHY, WHY?!

06:20.955 --> 06:23.430
Of all the worst things
that could happen...

06:23.425 --> 06:27.431
...this is the! Worst! Possible! Thing!

06:29.183 --> 06:31.418
What's happened?! Are you all right?

06:31.868 --> 06:35.401
I've lost my diamond
encrusted purple ribbon!

06:35.392 --> 06:38.074
I have searched HIGH!
And I have searched low.

06:38.067 --> 06:39.778
LOW AND HIGH!
High and low.

06:40.554 --> 06:42.318
But I can't find it anywhere!

06:42.894 --> 06:45.362
ANYWHERE!

06:45.882 --> 06:50.204
How can I possibly finish
my latest creation if I can't find it?

06:50.388 --> 06:54.018
Never fear, Rarity. As your friend
I'll do my best to help you fi...

06:54.008 --> 06:55.389
Oh, there it is.

06:55.385 --> 06:58.259
Isn't it always just
the last place you look.

06:59.405 --> 07:03.168
So you just lost your ribbon...

07:04.912 --> 07:06.950
...but now you've found it.

07:06.945 --> 07:07.927
Yeah.

07:07.926 --> 07:10.410
And nothing else is bothering you?

07:10.402 --> 07:14.030
Nothing that I as a good friend
could help you with?

07:15.829 --> 07:17.866
There is one thing.

07:17.970 --> 07:19.252
YES?!

07:19.250 --> 07:21.558
I think I've left my measuring tape
under the fabric over there.

07:21.552 --> 07:23.223
Could you get that for me?

07:25.709 --> 07:28.036
Measuring tape. Sure.

07:28.358 --> 07:30.913
Twilight. Is there something bother...

07:31.732 --> 07:33.059
Twilight.

07:37.319 --> 07:40.152
No need to panic.
Rarity is just one pony.

07:40.144 --> 07:42.523
I'm sure one of my other
friends will need me.

08:00.166 --> 08:02.272
What in the world...

08:03.113 --> 08:05.716
Rainbow must be angry with Applejack!

08:05.709 --> 08:09.170
She must hate her guts. Oh, wonderful!

08:09.733 --> 08:11.934
Rainbow Dash! Stop!

08:13.096 --> 08:17.493
Listen, Rainbow. I know you're upset
with Applejack, but don't worry.

08:17.480 --> 08:19.686
Whatever it is that has
come between you two...

08:19.680 --> 08:24.477
...I'm sure that I as a good friend
can help you resolve your problems.

08:25.669 --> 08:27.993
Uh, what are you talking about?

08:28.042 --> 08:29.885
Oh, Rainbow Dash.

08:29.881 --> 08:32.023
You don't have to hide
your feelings from me.

08:32.015 --> 08:34.852
I can tell you two must
have had a terrible fight.

08:35.159 --> 08:39.695
Now, why don't you tell me all
about your issues with Applejack?

08:39.682 --> 08:41.876
I don't have any issues with Applejack.

08:41.871 --> 08:45.356
You don't? Then why are you
destroying her property?

08:45.346 --> 08:46.878
Because she asked me to.

08:46.874 --> 08:48.241
Right, Applejack?

08:48.238 --> 08:49.431
Yes, ma'am.

08:49.428 --> 08:52.954
I wanted to put up a new barn, but
this one's gotta come down first.

08:53.420 --> 08:54.883
Now get back to it, RD.

08:55.179 --> 08:57.047
You got it, boss!

08:57.416 --> 08:59.161
I'd take cover if I were you.

09:24.948 --> 09:27.514
I can't believe I've
wasted all that time.

09:27.508 --> 09:29.342
I should have just come here first.

09:29.337 --> 09:32.128
Fluttershy always has some fear
she's trying to get over.

09:32.319 --> 09:35.234
As a good friend
I'll be able to help her.

09:47.412 --> 09:48.516
Fluttershy?!

09:56.220 --> 09:57.709
How can this be happening?!

09:57.705 --> 10:01.234
Of all the days she had to stop being such
a scaredy-pony she had to pick today?!

10:01.225 --> 10:03.504
What am I going to do?

10:04.365 --> 10:06.706
You really should have
come to me sooner.

10:06.700 --> 10:10.200
You were carrying so much
tension in that shoulder.

10:14.076 --> 10:17.998
It's fine. It'll all be fine.
Today isn't over yet.

10:17.986 --> 10:19.534
But it will be over soon!

10:21.889 --> 10:25.819
It'll be all over! My time in Ponyville,
my advanced studies...

10:25.808 --> 10:29.148
No, no. You're a good student.
You can do this.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.414
Oh! But what if I can't?

10:31.409 --> 10:33.528
You can! You just
have to keep it together.

10:33.522 --> 10:35.274
Keep! It! Together!

10:35.961 --> 10:38.568
Are you talking to... yourself?

10:39.725 --> 10:40.813
Twilight?

10:49.718 --> 10:51.149
SNAP OUT OF IT!

10:51.812 --> 10:52.691
Huh?

10:52.987 --> 10:54.397
Are you okay?

10:57.558 --> 10:59.425
Twilight, I'm really worried.

10:59.420 --> 11:01.706
I mean this letter thing
is really getting to you.

11:01.701 --> 11:02.543
Here.

11:02.540 --> 11:05.841
You've been so anxious all day that
you've completely forgot about the picnic.

11:05.832 --> 11:08.115
Why don't you just relax
and go hang out with...

11:08.110 --> 11:09.202
The picnic!

11:10.113 --> 11:12.126
I should go see my friends!

11:12.121 --> 11:14.439
I'm glad you've come to your senses.

11:22.988 --> 11:26.115
Please tell me I did not forget the plates.

11:26.223 --> 11:28.328
I did! I totally forgot them!

11:28.731 --> 11:31.412
Of all the worst things
that could happen, this is...

11:31.405 --> 11:34.763
The! Worst! Possible! Thing!

11:35.536 --> 11:39.511
Why, why, why!

11:41.604 --> 11:42.566
What?

11:42.564 --> 11:45.218
You didn't expect me to
lay on the grass, did you?

11:53.963 --> 11:55.160
You all right, hun?

11:55.157 --> 11:55.826
NO!

11:55.824 --> 11:57.537
I am not all right.

12:00.150 --> 12:01.719
It's just terrible.

12:02.203 --> 12:03.189
Yes?

12:03.187 --> 12:04.767
Simply awful.

12:05.062 --> 12:06.255
Yes?

12:06.252 --> 12:08.027
It's the most terrific trouble
I've ever been in...

12:08.022 --> 12:10.977
...and I really, really,
really need your help!

12:11.469 --> 12:12.615
YES?

12:12.612 --> 12:15.661
My letter to Princess Celestia
is almost overdue.

12:15.653 --> 12:18.622
And I haven't learned
anything about friendship!

12:20.587 --> 12:23.809
Oh, thank goodness. I thought
something really awful had happened.

12:26.295 --> 12:28.314
Something awful HAS happened!

12:29.220 --> 12:32.499
If I don't turn in the letter
on time, I'll be tardy!

12:33.014 --> 12:34.747
TAAARDY!

12:39.076 --> 12:40.398
No offense, sugar cube...

12:40.396 --> 12:43.942
...but it looks like somepony's gettin'
themselves all worked up over nothin'.

12:44.281 --> 12:47.036
This is not nothing.
This is everything!

12:47.029 --> 12:50.714
I need you guys to help me find somepony
with a problem I can fix before sundown.

12:50.704 --> 12:53.343
MY WHOLE LIFE DEPENDS ON IT!

12:54.103 --> 12:56.889
Oh, Twilight. You're such a crackup.

12:58.316 --> 12:59.468
Come on, now.

12:59.692 --> 13:01.757
Have a seat and stop
sweatin' small stuff.

13:05.547 --> 13:08.880
Wow. I've never seen
Twilight so upset before.

13:08.871 --> 13:11.714
Ugh, what a drama queen.

13:13.032 --> 13:14.925
Relatively speaking.

13:19.083 --> 13:20.371
Clock is ticking, Twilight.

13:20.672 --> 13:22.787
Clock... is... ticking!

13:24.386 --> 13:25.640
Keep it together.

13:26.429 --> 13:28.948
If I can't find a friendship problem...

13:29.737 --> 13:31.826
...I'll *make* a friendship problem!

13:50.382 --> 13:52.234
Hai, gurls!

13:53.204 --> 13:55.454
Oh. Hi, Twilight. How's it goi..

13:55.447 --> 13:57.728
Guh-reat! Just great!

13:58.121 --> 14:00.118
You three look like
you're doing great too!

14:00.113 --> 14:01.808
Looks like three good
friends who obviously...

14:01.804 --> 14:04.928
...don't need the help
of another good friend!

14:06.496 --> 14:08.559
This is Smarty Pants.

14:08.554 --> 14:10.378
She was mine when I was your age.

14:10.374 --> 14:12.777
And now I want to give her to you!

14:14.426 --> 14:17.047
Uh... She's... great!

14:17.039 --> 14:19.595
Yeah... Great.

14:19.588 --> 14:23.793
I really like her... mane?

14:23.782 --> 14:27.300
She even comes with
her own notebook and quill.

14:27.290 --> 14:30.583
For when you want to pretend
she's doing her homework.

14:31.244 --> 14:34.373
That's, um... great.

14:34.364 --> 14:37.052
Yeah... Great.

14:38.543 --> 14:41.850
I really like her... mane?

14:41.940 --> 14:44.359
I just hope the fact that
there are three of you...

14:44.353 --> 14:47.113
...and only one of her
doesn't become a problem.

14:47.105 --> 14:50.521
I'd hate to cause a rift
between such good friends!

14:51.738 --> 14:53.418
So who wants to play with her first?

14:53.966 --> 14:56.342
Uh... You should play
with her first, Sweetie Belle.

14:56.336 --> 14:58.692
You know, cause you
like her mane so much.

14:59.076 --> 15:00.408
Nononononono.

15:00.405 --> 15:03.715
I think Scootaloo should
get to play with her first.

15:03.706 --> 15:06.862
I'd love to, but, um...
You take her, Apple Bloom.

15:07.742 --> 15:10.410
Applejack says it's important to share.

15:11.290 --> 15:13.948
I got to think of something.
Thinkthinkthink, Twilight, think!

15:14.572 --> 15:15.752
That's it!

15:16.199 --> 15:18.909
Ooh, you're going to like Smarty Pants.

15:18.902 --> 15:21.531
And you're going to like her
more than anything.

15:30.393 --> 15:31.777
I want it.

15:31.773 --> 15:33.705
I need it.

15:33.701 --> 15:35.962
I really like her mane!

15:38.651 --> 15:41.417
The "want it, need it" spell.
Works every time.

15:41.771 --> 15:43.875
Okay, okay. Let's break it up.

15:43.870 --> 15:46.408
I think you can all see that
there is an important lesson...

15:46.400 --> 15:47.867
...to be learned here about...

15:49.389 --> 15:51.941
Come on, girls. We're all friends here, right?

15:52.037 --> 15:53.672
Don't you think you have to share?

15:54.498 --> 15:55.740
No way!

16:02.450 --> 16:04.696
Big McIntosh! Thank goodness!

16:04.690 --> 16:07.630
You gotta help me get that
doll away from those girls.

16:07.844 --> 16:09.536
Eeyup.

16:16.463 --> 16:20.283
Thank you so much. Now if
you could just give her to me...

16:20.781 --> 16:22.156
Nnnope.

16:23.439 --> 16:24.528
Oh no!

16:29.033 --> 16:30.503
What's all the commotion about?

16:30.499 --> 16:32.090
They're fighting over that doll!

16:32.086 --> 16:35.016
That incredible, amazing doll!

16:36.975 --> 16:39.743
Can't get a clear shot...

16:44.647 --> 16:45.690
Give me!

16:50.082 --> 16:51.387
Nnnope.

16:53.070 --> 16:54.760
Oh, what have I done?!

17:01.257 --> 17:02.650
Y'all hear that?

17:05.439 --> 17:09.186
What in the name of all things
oats 'n apples is goin' on here?

17:16.813 --> 17:19.295
-DON'T LOOK AT IT!
-Don't look at what?

17:19.289 --> 17:20.776
My Smarty Pants doll.

17:20.771 --> 17:23.861
I enchanted her and now
everypony is fighting over her.

17:24.546 --> 17:26.733
Why would you enchant your doll?

17:26.728 --> 17:28.107
Oh, I had to do something!

17:28.104 --> 17:30.305
I had nothing to report to Princess Celestia.

17:30.299 --> 17:33.658
I thought if I couldn't find
a problem, I'd make a problem.

17:33.648 --> 17:35.578
The day is almost over!

17:35.930 --> 17:37.374
Not almost.

17:43.655 --> 17:45.519
Twilight Sparkle!

17:48.514 --> 17:50.273
Whoa, Nelly.

18:19.972 --> 18:22.340
Meet me in the library.

18:24.392 --> 18:27.540
Goodbye, girls. If you care to visit...

18:28.028 --> 18:32.064
...I'll be in magic kindergarten
back in Canterlot.

18:33.793 --> 18:36.683
-Magic kindergarten?
-Canterlot?

18:37.458 --> 18:40.012
We're never gonna see Twilight again!

18:40.520 --> 18:42.394
What are we gonna do, y'all?

18:42.427 --> 18:45.137
Of all the worst things
that could happen...

18:45.323 --> 18:49.387
...this is the! Worst! Possible! Thing!

18:53.074 --> 18:55.972
What? I really mean it this time.

18:57.208 --> 19:01.592
But... But... I'm supposed to send you
a letter about friendship every week.

19:01.806 --> 19:03.115
I missed the deadline.

19:03.113 --> 19:06.798
I'm a bad student. I'm tardy!

19:06.907 --> 19:09.483
You are a wonderful student, Twilight.

19:09.477 --> 19:12.285
I don't have to get a letter
every week to know that.

19:12.679 --> 19:13.691
Really?

19:16.279 --> 19:17.016
WAIT!

19:17.015 --> 19:18.338
You can't punish her!

19:18.335 --> 19:19.731
It wasn't her fault!

19:19.728 --> 19:20.938
I'm listening.

19:20.935 --> 19:23.674
Please, your highness.
We all saw that Twilight was upset.

19:23.667 --> 19:25.822
But we thought that the thing
she was worrying about...

19:25.816 --> 19:27.688
...wasn't worth worrying about.

19:27.684 --> 19:29.577
So when she ran out all worked up...

19:29.571 --> 19:31.814
...not a single one of us
tried to stop her.

19:31.809 --> 19:34.358
As Twilight's good friends,
we should have taken...

19:34.351 --> 19:37.023
...her feelings seriously
and been there for her.

19:37.016 --> 19:38.828
Please don't take her away from us...

19:38.823 --> 19:41.630
...just because we were
too insensitive to help her.

19:44.156 --> 19:47.407
Looks like you all learned
a pretty valuable lesson today.

19:49.979 --> 19:54.635
Very well. I'll forget Twilight's
punishment on one condition.

19:57.487 --> 19:59.361
From this day forth
I would like you all...

19:59.357 --> 20:02.514
...to report to me your findings
on the magic of friendship.

20:02.505 --> 20:05.555
When and only when you happen to discover them.

20:09.615 --> 20:11.539
Princess Celestia! Wait!

20:11.534 --> 20:13.555
How did you know I was in trouble?

20:13.649 --> 20:15.171
Your friend Spike made me aware...

20:15.167 --> 20:17.545
...that you were letting
your fears get the best of you.

20:17.538 --> 20:20.605
I commend him for taking
your feelings seriously.

20:20.822 --> 20:24.473
Now, if you will all excuse me,
I must return to Canterlot.

20:24.881 --> 20:26.907
I'm expecting some mail.

20:31.153 --> 20:34.464
Y'all heard the princess.
Spike, take a letter.

20:40.749 --> 20:43.480
"Dear Princess Celestia.
We're writin' to you..."

20:43.472 --> 20:46.393
"...because today we all learned
a little somethin' about friendship."

20:46.385 --> 20:49.580
"We learned that you should take
your friends' worries seriously."

20:49.572 --> 20:52.611
"Even if you don't think that
she has anything to worry about."

20:52.602 --> 20:55.845
"And that you shouldn't let
your worries turn a small problem..."

20:55.836 --> 20:59.096
"...into an enormously huge
entire-town-in-total-chaos..."

20:59.088 --> 21:01.807
"...Princess-has-to-come-
-and-save-the-day problem."

21:01.799 --> 21:04.635
"Signed, your loyal subjects."

21:06.036 --> 21:08.986
"PS. Obviously Spike did not
have to learn a lesson..."

21:08.978 --> 21:12.372
"...because he is the best, most
awesome friend a pony could ask for."

21:12.362 --> 21:15.750
"Unlike everypony else,
he took things seriously. And..."

21:18.073 --> 21:19.575
Uh... Yeah.

21:19.572 --> 21:21.155
I'll just, um...

21:22.305 --> 21:28.309
