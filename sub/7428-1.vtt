01:39.600 --> 01:41.300
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:41.300 --> 01:43.400
...we are beginning our descent
into Berlin Tegel...

01:43.400 --> 01:47.700
...where local time is 8:30 a.m. And the
temperature is a cool minus four degrees.

01:47.700 --> 01:49.700
Morning.

01:49.700 --> 01:51.300
Did you sleep?

01:51.300 --> 01:55.400
No. I'll sleep at the hotel.

01:55.400 --> 01:58.500
You'll do great.

01:58.500 --> 02:01.900
You always do.

02:14.500 --> 02:16.200
What's the purpose of your visit?

02:16.200 --> 02:24.700
We're here for a biotechnology summit.
I'm giving a presentation.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.500
Mr. And Mrs. Harris, welcome to Berlin.

02:28.500 --> 02:31.600
Danke schon.

02:31.600 --> 02:34.200
Next, please.

02:34.200 --> 02:36.100
"I'm giving a presentation"?

02:36.100 --> 02:39.700
Well, she asked.

02:41.900 --> 02:44.900
- Oof. Welcome to Berlin.
- Taxi.

02:44.900 --> 02:47.400
Taxi.

03:07.100 --> 03:13.100
Martin, get in the car. Let him do that.

03:13.400 --> 03:16.400
Oh, ya-ya.

03:51.300 --> 03:53.400
What do you think he's saying?

03:53.400 --> 03:56.200
No idea.

04:01.200 --> 04:03.900
Look. Isabel Kronenberger is showing
here on Saturday.

04:03.900 --> 04:05.200
Oh, yeah.

04:05.200 --> 04:08.000
Remember when we saw her
in Chicago?

04:08.000 --> 04:10.400
Yes.

04:12.300 --> 04:17.500
Why don't I meet you there on Saturday
after my lunch with Professor Bressler?

04:17.500 --> 04:20.000
Yeah.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.300
If you promise.

04:21.300 --> 04:24.300
I promise.

04:57.400 --> 05:00.100
- Welcome to the Hotel Adlon Kempinski.
- Thank you.

05:00.100 --> 05:02.600
You check in, honey.
I'll take care of this.

05:02.600 --> 05:04.200
Have you stayed with us before?

05:04.200 --> 05:09.900
- First time in Berlin.
- First time in Berlin.

05:09.900 --> 05:12.700
If there's anything else
I can do for you...

05:12.700 --> 05:14.100
How much do I owe you?

05:14.100 --> 05:15.700
Thirty-seven, sir.

05:15.700 --> 05:18.900
Welcome to the Adlon Kempinski Berlin.
How may I help you, madam?

05:18.900 --> 05:22.700
- Dr. And Mrs. Harris, the Eisenhower suite.
- Of course.

05:22.700 --> 05:25.200
- Wait, wait.
- Everything okay, sir?

05:25.200 --> 05:30.300
- Is this everything from the taxi?
- Yes, sir.

05:30.300 --> 05:34.400
I'm afraid, Mrs. Harris, but the Eisenhower
suite may not be available right now.

05:34.400 --> 05:36.000
What do you mean "not available"?

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
There have been changes,
security reasons.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.800
But we confirmed two weeks ago.

05:40.800 --> 05:42.900
Would you allow me
to answer the phone?

05:42.900 --> 05:49.200
I'll go to the airport.
I'll be back, okay?

06:16.100 --> 06:18.000
Oh, please.

06:18.000 --> 06:24.200
Excuse me, driver?
Is there another route?

06:36.500 --> 06:39.700
Oh, come on.

06:54.000 --> 06:57.700
- Look out!
- No!

08:18.700 --> 08:22.000
Hello? Hello?

08:22.600 --> 08:26.200
Can you hear me?

10:04.900 --> 10:07.900
Dr. Farge?

10:09.000 --> 10:13.100
Dr. Farge. Dr. Farge.

10:25.300 --> 10:27.800
I don't speak German.

10:27.800 --> 10:30.600
Are you English?

10:30.600 --> 10:33.500
American.

10:34.400 --> 10:36.800
You have been in an accident.

10:36.800 --> 10:39.700
Accident?

10:40.900 --> 10:45.100
Can you tell me your name?

10:45.100 --> 10:46.500
Your name.

10:46.500 --> 10:50.700
Martin. Martin Harris.

10:50.900 --> 10:54.700
Dr. Martin Harris.

10:54.800 --> 10:58.500
Where's my wife, Liz?

10:58.500 --> 11:01.100
- Is she hurt? Is she hurt? Where is she?
- Calm down.

11:01.100 --> 11:04.400
It's all right, Dr. Harris.
You were the only passenger.

11:04.400 --> 11:07.100
The taxi you were in
went into the river.

11:07.100 --> 11:10.100
Your heart stopped for several minutes.

11:10.100 --> 11:14.600
It's Thursday, November 24th.
You have been in a coma for four days.

11:14.600 --> 11:19.800
Thanksgiving.
But my wife, she's in Berlin with me.

11:19.800 --> 11:22.000
Where is she? Why isn't she here?

11:22.000 --> 11:26.200
We couldn't find any identification
with you, Dr. Harris.

11:26.200 --> 11:27.800
No, no, no.

11:27.800 --> 11:29.600
- Please, calm down.
- Aah.

11:29.600 --> 11:33.400
Where can we reach your wife?
Does she have a cell phone?

11:33.400 --> 11:39.300
Of course she has a cell phone. It's...

11:39.600 --> 11:42.100
Uh...

11:43.100 --> 11:44.300
I can't remember.

11:44.300 --> 11:49.300
Can you tell me what you do remember,
Martin?

11:49.300 --> 11:53.100
Bits and pieces.
Arriving at the airport.

11:53.100 --> 11:56.800
Getting in a taxi with Liz...

11:56.800 --> 11:58.900
...but I don't know how I got here.

11:58.900 --> 12:02.200
There are no rules with severe trauma
of this kind.

12:02.200 --> 12:04.300
Memories get lost or fractured.

12:04.300 --> 12:06.600
Most of them return,
although it's unlikely...

12:06.600 --> 12:10.100
...you will ever fully recall the events
around your accident.

12:10.100 --> 12:13.100
In the meantime, let us see
if anyone has filed a report...

12:13.100 --> 12:15.000
...looking for a Martin Harris, okay?

12:15.000 --> 12:19.400
- Yes, yes, yes.
- Okay.

12:25.800 --> 12:28.400
From London
with Kevin Spencer and Diana Bailey.

12:28.400 --> 12:30.600
Good evening.
Welcome to the BNI World News.

12:30.600 --> 12:32.300
Here are today's top stories.

12:32.300 --> 12:34.700
The Prime Mini...

12:34.700 --> 12:37.700
Clothes. For you.

12:37.700 --> 12:41.700
Has anybody been
looking for me? My wife?

12:41.700 --> 12:44.800
Meine Frau?

13:16.000 --> 13:19.500
Come here, you.

13:23.200 --> 13:25.400
It's beautiful. Just beautiful.

13:25.400 --> 13:29.500
I'm glad you like it.

13:32.100 --> 13:34.500
She gave it to me as a gift.

13:34.500 --> 13:39.200
In Paris. On our honeymoon.

14:17.800 --> 14:22.900
Prince Shada arrived in Berlin today for
this year's biotechnology global summit.

14:22.900 --> 14:25.400
The personal attendance
of the flamboyant prince...

14:25.400 --> 14:29.200
...has fueled speculation that the summit,
now in its 10th year...

14:29.200 --> 14:32.700
...will witness the announcement
of a major scientific breakthrough.

14:32.700 --> 14:35.100
With the world's leading researchers
convening...

14:35.100 --> 14:37.800
...at the luxurious Hotel Adlon
in Central Berlin...

14:37.800 --> 14:40.000
- Hotel Adlon.
...the field of biotechnology...

14:40.000 --> 14:42.900
...steps into the forefront
of the media spotlight.

14:42.900 --> 14:44.800
I'm here for the summit.

14:44.800 --> 14:46.400
Nurse.

14:46.400 --> 14:48.400
You have to realize the risk.

14:48.400 --> 14:51.000
Doctor, I've been gone for four days.

14:51.000 --> 14:54.400
My wife is out there in a city
she doesn't know. She'll be terrified.

14:54.400 --> 14:58.300
I need to find her.

14:59.400 --> 15:01.400
Sign this.

15:01.400 --> 15:04.900
It releases you from my care.

15:04.900 --> 15:07.500
And here's my card.

15:07.500 --> 15:11.600
Any nausea, dizziness, difficulty with
speech, you contact me immediately.

15:11.600 --> 15:16.900
- Do you understand?
- Thank you.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.800
Welcome to the Hotel Adlon Kempinski.
How may I help you?

15:30.800 --> 15:34.600
Yes, hi. I'm a guest of the hotel.
I lost my room key. I need a new one.

15:34.600 --> 15:37.100
- What room are you staying in?
- The Eisenhower suite.

15:37.100 --> 15:41.900
- And may I have your name?
- Martin Harris. Dr. Martin Harris.

15:41.900 --> 15:44.700
And may I please see some ID,
Mr. Harris?

15:44.700 --> 15:48.800
There's been a situation.
I've lost my passport.

15:48.800 --> 15:51.000
I'm going to need some ID, sir.

15:51.000 --> 15:54.300
If you get someone to escort me
to my room, I can prove it.

15:54.300 --> 15:58.500
Just give me a moment.

16:19.900 --> 16:22.100
- Excuse me. Do you have an invitation?
- No.

16:22.100 --> 16:26.100
I mean, yes. My name is Dr. Martin Harris.
I'm on the list.

16:26.100 --> 16:28.400
- Let me check.
- I saw my wife go inside.

16:28.400 --> 16:29.900
I'm trying to find her.

16:29.900 --> 16:33.200
Herr Strauss?

16:34.200 --> 16:36.700
- Dr. Martin Harris?
- Yes.

16:36.700 --> 16:41.500
Yes. There you are. I'm Herr Strauss,
head of the Hotel Security.

16:41.500 --> 16:45.400
Do you have any identification?
Passport, driver's license?

16:45.400 --> 16:47.800
No, I don't, but...

16:47.800 --> 16:51.000
- You would know him, he's over there.
- Professor Bressler!

16:51.000 --> 16:53.100
- Professor Bressler!
- Sir, please.

16:53.100 --> 16:54.900
He knows me.
He can confirm who I am.

16:54.900 --> 17:01.100
- Lf you will be patient, sir, no problem.
- I'm being very patient.

17:01.100 --> 17:09.000
Thank God. There she is. That's my wife,
over there by the buffet table.

17:09.000 --> 17:13.200
I have been missing for four days and she
has no idea what happened to me...

17:13.200 --> 17:19.700
...so I need you to take me to her
right now.

17:21.600 --> 17:25.600
- Okay.
- Thank you.

17:25.700 --> 17:31.200
- The lady in the dark dress.
- Okay.

17:31.200 --> 17:34.800
Excuse me, madam.

17:34.800 --> 17:37.400
Your husband is here.

17:37.400 --> 17:40.900
Liz. Oh, Jesus.

17:41.300 --> 17:45.800
Excuse me. Do I know you?

17:48.700 --> 17:51.600
But, Liz... What's wrong?

17:51.600 --> 17:52.900
I'm sorry.

17:52.900 --> 18:00.800
I was in an accident. I was in a coma.
They didn't know who I was.

18:00.800 --> 18:03.600
I said I'm sorry.

18:03.600 --> 18:07.900
Oh, you must have me confused
with someone else.

18:07.900 --> 18:10.100
Liz.

18:10.100 --> 18:13.100
It's me, Martin.

18:13.100 --> 18:16.400
Your husband.

18:17.600 --> 18:20.900
This is a misunderstanding.
I don't know this man.

18:20.900 --> 18:23.900
- Okay.
- Martin.

18:23.900 --> 18:26.100
This is my husband.

18:26.100 --> 18:28.400
You are Dr. Martin Harris?

18:28.400 --> 18:30.900
Last time I looked.

18:30.900 --> 18:34.300
Yep, still me.

18:35.200 --> 18:39.000
What's going on here?
Is this some kind of a joke?

18:39.000 --> 18:40.900
Joke about what?

18:40.900 --> 18:43.300
Because it's not very funny.

18:43.300 --> 18:46.600
- Do you know this man?
- No.

18:46.600 --> 18:49.600
Who the hell are you?

18:49.600 --> 18:53.000
Who the hell are you?

18:53.000 --> 18:55.700
I'm her husband.

18:55.700 --> 18:57.500
Okay. Okay.

18:57.500 --> 19:01.300
Would you mind just getting him
away from us, please?

19:01.300 --> 19:03.000
- Liz. Liz, stop this.
- Hey.

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
- Gentlemen, please, please, please.
- Get your hands off me.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.600
- Back off.
- What's going on?

19:07.600 --> 19:08.900
- Tell me.
- Back off!

19:08.900 --> 19:11.400
- What's this all about?
- Why don't you take a walk?

19:11.400 --> 19:12.900
Gentlemen, please.

19:12.900 --> 19:14.900
- Don't touch me.
- Come on, come on!

19:14.900 --> 19:17.500
If you don't leave now,
we have to call the police.

19:17.500 --> 19:20.900
Call the police! Call the goddamn army!
That's a good idea!

19:20.900 --> 19:23.400
What's happening?
You're embarrassing me. Please.

19:23.400 --> 19:25.000
- Get him out of here.
- Liz!

19:25.000 --> 19:28.200
- I must apologize. Have a nice evening.
- I was hurt!

19:28.200 --> 19:31.000
- Liz! Why are you doing this to me?
- You okay?

19:31.000 --> 19:32.600
Can you believe this?

19:32.600 --> 19:33.900
Right there.

19:33.900 --> 19:38.200
That's Liz. And I am...

19:39.900 --> 19:44.200
I must've been outside.
I can't remember.

19:44.200 --> 19:47.700
Well, as you can see, you are not there.

19:47.700 --> 19:51.200
Immigration confirms the arrival
of a Dr. And Mrs. Harris...

19:51.200 --> 19:54.700
...on November the 20th at 7:40 a.m.
- Yes.

19:54.700 --> 19:58.100
At 8:50, she checked into their suite
at the hotel...

19:58.100 --> 20:01.900
...followed by Dr. Harris
at 3 in the afternoon.

20:01.900 --> 20:04.700
- What?
- Danke.

20:04.700 --> 20:08.100
Wait. He's... He's not Martin Harris.

20:08.100 --> 20:11.000
I am Dr. Martin Harris.

20:11.000 --> 20:14.300
The man upstairs is pretending
to be me.

20:14.300 --> 20:16.800
And this impostor,
did he also steal your wife?

20:16.800 --> 20:19.400
He must be forcing her or something.

20:19.400 --> 20:22.200
Well, why? Help me. Why?

20:22.200 --> 20:25.300
For God's sake,
just do an Internet search.

20:25.300 --> 20:28.300
There are over 400 Martin Harrises
in the United States, sir.

20:28.300 --> 20:30.500
We already checked.

20:30.500 --> 20:34.300
Rod. Rodney Cole,
a colleague at Langemore in the States.

20:34.300 --> 20:36.800
A dear friend.
He can verify who I am.

20:36.800 --> 20:41.600
Please, call him. It's 001...

20:41.600 --> 20:45.200
...508-146-2595.

20:48.300 --> 20:50.800
This is Dr. Cole. I'm having an...

20:50.800 --> 20:52.300
Sorry, answering machine.

20:52.300 --> 20:53.500
Please, leave a message.

20:53.500 --> 20:57.100
Professor Bressler. Talk to him.
He's the reason I'm in Berlin.

20:57.100 --> 20:59.700
He invited me over to the summit
to discuss my thesis.

20:59.700 --> 21:01.600
- You know Professor Bressler?
- Yes.

21:01.600 --> 21:05.800
Well, we haven't actually met,
but we've been speaking on the phone...

21:05.800 --> 21:10.900
...e- mailing, dozens of times.

21:11.100 --> 21:13.900
- Why don't you arrest him?
- For what?

21:13.900 --> 21:15.800
Entering the country legally?

21:15.800 --> 21:20.500
Presenting all the correct documentation
and sharing a hotel suite with his wife?

21:20.500 --> 21:23.900
Excuse me. With your wife.

21:23.900 --> 21:27.200
She is my wife.

21:27.200 --> 21:30.500
Herr Strauss? I found a Dr. Martin Harris
at Langemore University.

21:30.500 --> 21:37.200
Yes. Thank you.
That's what I've been trying...

21:37.600 --> 21:40.100
Okay.

21:40.100 --> 21:42.300
Wait, please, wait.

21:42.300 --> 21:46.100
You're going to arrest me?
I demand to speak to my embassy.

21:46.100 --> 21:55.400
Unfortunately, it's your Thanksgiving.
The embassy's closed until Monday.

21:56.900 --> 22:01.800
Herr Strauss,
can I have a quiet word, please?

22:01.800 --> 22:04.300
Okay.

22:06.400 --> 22:09.300
Listen...

22:09.900 --> 22:12.800
...you're probably right. L...

22:12.800 --> 22:15.200
The accident.

22:15.200 --> 22:16.600
I, uh...

22:16.600 --> 22:20.800
I haven't been remembering things
very well. I'm confused.

22:20.800 --> 22:24.300
This is my doctor
at the hospital here in Berlin.

22:24.300 --> 22:30.100
He warned me that this sort of thing,
this was gonna happen.

22:30.100 --> 22:33.600
I need to go back there now.

22:33.600 --> 22:37.500
I'm so embarrassed.

22:39.100 --> 22:46.800
So now you are saying
that you are not Dr. Martin Harris?

22:47.600 --> 22:50.900
I don't know.

23:16.900 --> 23:22.800
Wait, stop. Stop. I've changed my mind.

24:34.100 --> 24:36.600
- Need passport.
- Please.

24:36.600 --> 24:38.700
Please?

24:38.700 --> 24:42.400
Police. Very bad.

24:49.700 --> 24:51.400
This is Dr. Cole.

24:51.400 --> 24:56.200
I'm having an out-of-office experience
right now. Please, leave a message.

24:56.200 --> 24:57.900
Rodney, it's me, Martin.

24:57.900 --> 25:01.400
Listen, I'm in Berlin
for the summit, but...

25:01.400 --> 25:04.000
It's Liz. She's...

25:04.000 --> 25:07.300
l... I don't know what she's doing...

25:07.300 --> 25:09.600
...and there's another man involved.

25:09.600 --> 25:13.500
It... She... She...

25:14.800 --> 25:18.600
I'm in trouble, Rod. We...

25:18.600 --> 25:21.100
Shit.

29:04.400 --> 29:09.300
He says he doesn't care
if she saved your life.

29:09.300 --> 29:14.300
The bitch cost him 20,000 Euros.

29:14.300 --> 29:20.500
The insurance won't cover the cab
as she had no license.

29:20.500 --> 29:27.400
He says illegal immigrants
are destroying German society.

29:27.400 --> 29:29.900
So I'm guessing he doesn't know
where she is.

29:29.900 --> 29:34.500
No one knows where she is.

29:34.600 --> 29:39.500
Well, thank him for his time.

29:40.700 --> 29:41.900
Excuse me.

29:41.900 --> 29:44.100
Hey, American.
I'm sorry we couldn't help you.

29:44.100 --> 29:46.000
You know where she is, I can tell.

29:46.000 --> 29:49.500
Look, I just wanna thank her.
She saved my life.

29:49.500 --> 29:54.400
I thought maybe I could give her
some money. I just wanna thank her.

29:54.400 --> 29:57.100
Please.

30:11.200 --> 30:13.100
You remember me?

30:13.100 --> 30:16.300
- I was in your taxi.
- I don't drive taxi.

30:16.300 --> 30:17.800
I was in your taxi.

30:17.800 --> 30:19.200
We crashed.

30:19.200 --> 30:22.200
I need to know,
where did you pick me up?

30:22.200 --> 30:24.200
- Where was I going?
- How did you find me?

30:24.200 --> 30:28.000
Your friend, Biko.

30:28.600 --> 30:32.600
Just leave me alone.

30:32.900 --> 30:35.200
Please, help me.

30:35.200 --> 30:38.700
Just leave me alone.

30:38.700 --> 30:43.100
Thank you for saving me.

30:52.900 --> 30:54.100
Excuse me.

30:54.100 --> 30:58.100
I need to find Professor Bressler's lab.
I have an appointment at 12:30. I'm late.

30:58.100 --> 31:04.200
- Your name, please?
- Dr. Martin Harris.

31:05.400 --> 31:06.900
Wait here, please.

31:06.900 --> 31:08.400
The professor knows who I am.

31:08.400 --> 31:14.400
We scheduled this appointment
weeks ago.

31:34.900 --> 31:36.600
Drake, the English botanist...

31:36.600 --> 31:39.200
...who wondered how it manages
to reproduce...

31:39.200 --> 31:42.800
...as it doesn't appear to attract
any insects.

31:42.800 --> 31:50.800
Yes. One wonders how plants are
developing firm, unlike m...

31:51.500 --> 31:53.800
- Bressler.
- This lab is restricted. Who are you?

31:53.800 --> 31:59.400
This man is not Martin Harris.
I am Dr. Martin Harris.

31:59.400 --> 32:03.500
So, what is this?
There are two Martin Harrises, huh?

32:03.500 --> 32:05.100
No, let me explain.

32:05.100 --> 32:08.300
This man showed up at my hotel last night
claiming to be me.

32:08.300 --> 32:11.500
- The police were called.
- I called the police, son of a bitch!

32:11.500 --> 32:13.400
He checked himself out of a hospital.

32:13.400 --> 32:17.400
- He was in an accident.
- Professor.

32:17.400 --> 32:19.200
Ja. Danke.

32:19.200 --> 32:21.600
We talked, you and I, on the phone.

32:21.600 --> 32:24.200
We discussed
alternative forms of propagation.

32:24.200 --> 32:29.300
I told you about my father,
a schoolteacher, his passion for science.

32:29.300 --> 32:31.000
We talked about your children...

32:31.000 --> 32:34.400
...about how much time you've spent
with them since you lost your wife.

32:34.400 --> 32:36.900
Two girls, right?

32:36.900 --> 32:40.000
You told me their names. And I...

32:40.000 --> 32:42.200
I just can't...

32:42.200 --> 32:44.700
I know them. I know them.

32:44.700 --> 32:46.800
- Laurel.
- Laurel, Lily, twins.

32:46.800 --> 32:48.800
Ten years old.

32:48.800 --> 32:53.000
About the same age I was when I told
my father I wanted to be a botanist.

32:53.000 --> 32:56.100
Do you remember, Professor?
We talked about that on the phone...

32:56.100 --> 32:58.500
...how I'd never seen my father
this happy.

32:58.500 --> 32:59.700
No, that wasn't you.

32:59.700 --> 33:03.100
Don't you remember? We spoke
about how brave our wives were...

33:03.100 --> 33:04.500
To marry scientists.

33:04.500 --> 33:07.300
- I told you about our...
- Our honeymoon in Paris.

33:07.300 --> 33:10.900
My wife and I. And how she wanted to visit
all the museums.

33:10.900 --> 33:14.200
- All I wanted to do was go to the...
- L'Ecole Polytechnique.

33:14.200 --> 33:19.200
But she insisted. And that's how
I first saw Leonardo's Vitruvian man.

33:19.200 --> 33:21.600
Wow.

33:25.400 --> 33:28.100
This is not happening.

33:28.100 --> 33:29.400
Moment, Moment.

33:29.400 --> 33:34.600
I don't know who this man is,
but he has taken everything from me.

33:34.600 --> 33:37.200
You have to arrest him.

33:37.200 --> 33:40.800
Go on, arrest him.

33:40.800 --> 33:46.200
I don't believe I need to do this.

34:16.200 --> 34:18.500
No.

34:38.000 --> 34:41.600
My friend, he...

34:42.700 --> 34:45.100
...looks...

34:45.100 --> 34:49.100
No, he finds people.

34:53.800 --> 34:56.300
Martin.

34:56.300 --> 34:59.300
The mistake was mine.
I should never have let you leave.

34:59.300 --> 35:02.200
- What's happening to me, doctor?
- Confusion...

35:02.200 --> 35:05.800
...memory loss,
complete or partial loss of identity.

35:05.800 --> 35:08.700
These are common stages in recovery.

35:08.700 --> 35:10.600
A person can awaken from a coma...

35:10.600 --> 35:14.700
...convinced of a reality
that was previously only fantasy.

35:14.700 --> 35:17.000
We are going to sedate you now...

35:17.000 --> 35:21.100
...do another MRI,
try to find out what's going on, okay?

35:21.100 --> 35:26.300
If I'm not Martin Harris,
why do I know so much about him?

35:26.300 --> 35:31.500
Perhaps he was someone
you read about...

35:31.500 --> 35:34.600
...or met once in passing.

35:34.600 --> 35:39.500
Do you know what it feels like
to become insane, doctor?

35:39.500 --> 35:44.400
It's like a war
between being told who you are...

35:44.400 --> 35:47.900
...and knowing who you are.

35:47.900 --> 35:52.300
Which do you think wins?

36:59.100 --> 37:05.200
Hello, Martin. This
won't take very long.

40:48.700 --> 40:54.800
It's okay. I'm feeling
much, much better.

42:15.700 --> 42:21.200
And now with us,
Rebecca for the weather.

42:21.200 --> 42:23.800
Hello?

42:24.800 --> 42:27.400
Hello?

42:28.300 --> 42:30.900
Hello?

42:34.500 --> 42:37.600
So it's going to be
a cold night here in Central Berlin...

42:37.600 --> 42:39.600
...with an overnight low
of three degrees...

42:39.600 --> 42:43.000
...and a high probability of more snow
throughout tomorrow.

42:43.000 --> 42:49.000
And now to the West,
to the Ruhr Valley.

43:10.900 --> 43:15.100
- Herr Jurgen?
- Yeah?

43:20.500 --> 43:22.100
You met her?

43:22.100 --> 43:24.300
She looked after me in the hospital.

43:24.300 --> 43:27.300
She was kind to me too.

43:27.300 --> 43:31.500
I'm sorry. She's dead.

43:33.100 --> 43:36.200
Come. Come in.

43:36.200 --> 43:39.200
Thank you.

43:49.400 --> 43:50.700
Drink?

43:50.700 --> 43:53.800
No, thanks.

43:56.600 --> 43:59.800
I was a former member of the Stasi...

43:59.800 --> 44:02.300
...the Ministry for State Security.

44:02.300 --> 44:06.600
- East German secret police, huh?
- Yes.

44:06.600 --> 44:09.400
Proudly.

44:17.800 --> 44:19.700
Excuse me.

44:19.700 --> 44:23.100
I cannot drink any longer,
but I like to forget that.

44:23.100 --> 44:26.500
We Germans are experts at forgetting.
We forgot we were Nazis.

44:26.500 --> 44:31.200
Now we have forgotten 40 years
of Communism, all gone.

44:31.200 --> 44:35.400
But it's not just history that's forgotten,
it's people too.

44:35.400 --> 44:42.300
Please tell me more about
Nurse Gretchen Herfort.

44:46.100 --> 44:47.900
Quite a story.

44:47.900 --> 44:51.100
For a moment,
they had me convinced I was crazy.

44:51.100 --> 44:55.000
But when they came to take me,
when they...

44:55.000 --> 45:00.000
...killed your friend, I knew.

45:00.200 --> 45:02.800
I'm not sure how I can be of service.

45:02.800 --> 45:08.300
I need you to help me prove I'm me.

45:10.200 --> 45:11.400
May I?

45:11.400 --> 45:13.400
Please.

45:13.400 --> 45:16.800
It's a gift from my father.

45:16.800 --> 45:21.300
I always have it with me.

45:31.400 --> 45:33.400
These mean anything to you?

45:33.400 --> 45:35.900
No. It's my wife's writing.

45:35.900 --> 45:40.900
So they mean something to her.

45:41.700 --> 45:46.500
That's my schedule for this week.
I wrote it from memory.

45:46.500 --> 45:48.600
Your wife's involvement in this.

45:48.600 --> 45:53.300
There must have been something in
the past, a new friend, an acquaintance?

45:53.300 --> 45:54.700
No, no, no.

45:54.700 --> 45:56.400
Unexplained absence?

45:56.400 --> 46:00.200
No, no. There was nothing.
I would've known.

46:00.200 --> 46:02.500
Men always like to think.

46:02.500 --> 46:05.500
It's not Liz. I know her.

46:05.500 --> 46:07.500
Yet she does not know you.

46:07.500 --> 46:11.000
Look, whoever's been doing this,
they've been planning it for some time.

46:11.000 --> 46:15.900
They have passports, credit cards,
family photos, for God's sakes.

46:15.900 --> 46:18.400
I mean, this takes preparation,
doesn't it?

46:18.400 --> 46:22.900
They have detailed knowledge of my
research, my relationship with Professor...

46:22.900 --> 46:26.300
As well as the fact that you were going
to have a random accident...

46:26.300 --> 46:30.700
...that would allow a stranger
to seamlessly take your place?

46:30.700 --> 46:34.000
These people may be good,
but they are not God.

46:34.000 --> 46:36.700
A little confirmation would be nice.

46:36.700 --> 46:39.800
Somewhere there's proof.
They can't have thought of everything.

46:39.800 --> 46:44.500
The question is,
why would they want to take your place?

46:44.500 --> 46:46.800
What could they gain from being you?

46:46.800 --> 46:52.800
What does your wife gain
by denying you exist?

46:52.800 --> 46:54.900
Do you believe me?

46:54.900 --> 46:57.700
In the Stasi, we had a basic principle:

46:57.700 --> 47:01.900
Ask enough questions and a man who
is lying will eventually change his story...

47:01.900 --> 47:05.500
...but a man who tells the truth
cannot change his...

47:05.500 --> 47:07.700
...however unlikely his story sounds.

47:07.700 --> 47:11.200
- Do you believe me?
- I believe...

47:11.200 --> 47:14.000
...you are telling
the truth, Dr. Harris.

47:14.000 --> 47:16.700
I'll start by calling your colleague
at Langemore.

47:16.700 --> 47:20.200
As you say, it's Thanksgiving,
and there's the time difference...

47:20.200 --> 47:23.500
...so it may take time to make contact.

47:23.500 --> 47:27.100
Then there is the question of...

47:27.100 --> 47:28.900
Oh, of money. Of course.

47:28.900 --> 47:33.500
Unfortunately, yes. Money.

47:33.700 --> 47:39.400
Of course. Here.
Here's everything I have.

47:39.400 --> 47:45.200
I'll pay you in full as soon as I can.

47:45.900 --> 47:48.600
- For expenses.
- Sure.

47:48.600 --> 47:51.500
I'll need 24 hours.
Call me tomorrow afternoon.

47:51.500 --> 47:56.000
And go find your taxi driver.
See if she'll talk to me.

47:56.000 --> 47:59.600
She was there at the beginning of all this.
Perhaps she knows something.

47:59.600 --> 48:01.700
I've already tried.

48:01.700 --> 48:05.100
There may be details we've overlooked.

48:05.100 --> 48:11.500
That's what I was really known for,
details.

48:15.700 --> 48:18.200
Gina?

48:25.600 --> 48:28.900
I know why you ran away
from the accident.

48:28.900 --> 48:30.600
You're an illegal.

48:30.600 --> 48:35.400
If the police had picked you up,
they would have deported you.

48:35.400 --> 48:38.500
Look, I want you to have this.

48:38.500 --> 48:42.400
- What if I don't want it?
- It's worth at least 5000 Euro.

48:42.400 --> 48:48.900
Feel the weight of it.
Go on. It's the real thing.

48:48.900 --> 48:50.800
"E.H. To M.H."?

48:50.800 --> 48:58.300
Elizabeth Harris, my wife, to me, Martin.
Special gift.

48:59.400 --> 49:01.900
Okay, Martin Harris.
What do you want?

49:01.900 --> 49:04.100
There's someone
I need you to speak to.

49:04.100 --> 49:07.500
- I'm not talking to the police.
- He's not the police. I promise you.

49:07.500 --> 49:10.300
I just need you to tell him
what happened.

49:10.300 --> 49:14.200
Anything,
everything you can remember.

49:14.200 --> 49:19.800
And I need a place to crash tonight.

49:21.300 --> 49:24.000
Please?

49:29.600 --> 49:36.100
Sentiment,
it's always the first thing to go.

49:43.900 --> 49:46.600
Brandt.

49:48.100 --> 49:50.800
Jurgen?

49:56.900 --> 50:01.400
I picked you up from the Adlon Hotel.
You wanted to go to the airport.

50:01.400 --> 50:02.800
You were in a hurry.

50:02.800 --> 50:04.800
That's it?

50:04.800 --> 50:08.500
But I'd just arrived.
Doesn't make sense.

50:08.500 --> 50:12.700
She didn't recognize you?
How long have you been married?

50:12.700 --> 50:14.400
- Five years.
- Five years?

50:14.400 --> 50:17.100
I know it sounds crazy, but it's true.

50:17.100 --> 50:18.800
This is it.

50:18.800 --> 50:21.400
Sorry, no elevator.

50:21.400 --> 50:26.200
I know, not the Adlon Hotel.

50:37.200 --> 50:42.400
The walls are made of cardboard,
but it's home.

50:42.400 --> 50:45.800
I have to work tonight.
You can sleep in there.

50:45.800 --> 50:48.300
I have extra mattress.

50:48.300 --> 50:51.500
It's quaint.

51:52.400 --> 51:55.500
Would you mind if I took a shower?

51:55.500 --> 51:58.700
You could try. I'm
not sure you will fit.

51:58.700 --> 52:08.800
The light is broken. You need to leave
the door open if you want to see anything.

52:19.800 --> 52:22.800
- I'm sorry. I just... I'm sorry.
- I give you a place to stay.

52:22.800 --> 52:26.100
- That does not give you the right to...
- You're right.

52:26.100 --> 52:30.800
They're good, the drawings.

52:42.000 --> 52:45.700
You want to know?

52:48.900 --> 52:50.500
This is me.

52:50.500 --> 52:54.100
Two thousand
two hundred fifty-eight Euros...

52:54.100 --> 52:56.300
...and counting.

52:56.300 --> 53:02.100
I get to 4000, I can buy papers
so I can get the hell out of here.

53:02.100 --> 53:04.800
Sell the watch.
You'll get more than you need.

53:04.800 --> 53:07.800
I plan to.

53:25.700 --> 53:27.200
Ohh.

53:27.200 --> 53:29.100
How do you sleep?

53:29.100 --> 53:34.300
Eh. He never goes for very long.

53:34.300 --> 53:35.900
This guy, Jurgen.

53:35.900 --> 53:41.200
He's absolutely no danger to you.

53:42.300 --> 53:44.800
Okay.

53:56.400 --> 53:58.800
Hello.

53:58.800 --> 54:00.200
You got company.

54:00.200 --> 54:01.400
Do you have the keys?

54:01.400 --> 54:04.200
Bring it back to my place,
leave the keys on the TV...

54:04.200 --> 54:06.700
...and don't forget to reset the meter.

54:06.700 --> 54:12.100
- You're the best.
- I know. Come.

54:12.800 --> 54:15.500
Yes, I sleep with every American
you send my way.

54:15.500 --> 54:19.400
No need to explain.

54:36.500 --> 54:41.500
Biko! You're going to be late.

56:00.500 --> 56:02.900
Shh.

56:07.000 --> 56:09.600
Jones?

56:58.700 --> 57:01.800
Biko? Biko?

57:55.200 --> 57:57.600
Who are you?

57:57.600 --> 58:01.700
Who the hell are you?

58:06.700 --> 58:08.200
Biko's keys.

58:08.200 --> 58:14.800
Give them to me.
Come on, you can't stay here.

58:23.900 --> 58:26.800
This one!

58:39.800 --> 58:42.800
Are you all right?

58:42.800 --> 58:45.700
That guy,
he killed a nurse in the hospital.

58:45.700 --> 58:50.500
- What?
- He killed a nurse.

58:53.300 --> 58:55.800
Shit!

59:24.800 --> 59:29.500
- Left, go left!
- Hang on!

1:00:07.300 --> 1:00:12.600
- Where is he?
- I can't see him.

1:00:20.500 --> 1:00:24.200
- Where is...? Where's the wiper switch?
- It's on the left!

1:00:24.200 --> 1:00:26.700
Shit!

1:00:42.600 --> 1:00:45.800
Come on! Go!

1:01:23.900 --> 1:01:29.700
- Get off the tracks!
- I'm trying to!

1:01:39.700 --> 1:01:42.300
Jesus!

1:02:05.900 --> 1:02:10.000
Come on, come on! Go!

1:02:12.600 --> 1:02:16.300
- Come on!
- Run!

1:02:27.800 --> 1:02:29.300
In here.

1:02:29.300 --> 1:02:34.400
Out of the way. Out of the way.

1:02:34.700 --> 1:02:40.300
- We are being followed.
- Vladimir.

1:03:13.400 --> 1:03:17.000
How does it feel

1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:20.400
To treat me like you do?

1:03:20.400 --> 1:03:24.100
When you've laid your hands upon me

1:03:24.100 --> 1:03:28.200
And you've told me who you are

1:03:28.200 --> 1:03:32.600
I thought I was mistaken

1:03:35.800 --> 1:03:39.000
How do I feel?

1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:43.600
Tell me now how do I feel?

1:03:45.900 --> 1:03:48.400
Gina.

1:03:49.200 --> 1:03:54.200
You have to know I have never laid eyes
on those men.

1:03:54.200 --> 1:03:56.600
Why the hell did you
have to get into my taxi?

1:03:56.600 --> 1:04:01.400
I wish I hadn't. Believe me.

1:04:02.300 --> 1:04:06.500
And Biko. His family is in Africa.

1:04:06.500 --> 1:04:14.100
The money will just stop coming.
They will never know why.

1:04:14.100 --> 1:04:16.300
Men like that, back there.

1:04:16.300 --> 1:04:19.500
I have seen those kind of men before.

1:04:19.500 --> 1:04:21.900
They killed my family in Bosnia.

1:04:21.900 --> 1:04:25.800
My mother, my father, my brothers,
slaughtered!

1:04:25.800 --> 1:04:27.500
We have to disappear.

1:04:27.500 --> 1:04:32.100
- Gina, they're after me, not you.
- Don't be stupid. They're after both of us!

1:04:32.100 --> 1:04:39.300
If they killed Biko,
they'll kill me just as easily.

1:05:44.700 --> 1:05:48.100
Are you ready?

1:05:48.200 --> 1:05:51.200
Don't ask.

1:05:58.800 --> 1:06:01.800
Thank you.

1:06:02.700 --> 1:06:08.200
I'm sorry I brought more trouble
into your life.

1:06:08.200 --> 1:06:14.300
I will try and make
up for it. I promise.

1:06:16.400 --> 1:06:19.100
I know.

1:06:19.700 --> 1:06:24.400
I've figured something out.

1:06:26.000 --> 1:06:29.000
It's a simple code.

1:06:29.000 --> 1:06:31.400
The first number refers to a page
in the book...

1:06:31.400 --> 1:06:35.400
...the second to a line on that page,
the third to words on that line.

1:06:35.400 --> 1:06:36.700
What are the words?

1:06:36.700 --> 1:06:38.700
The Latin names of two plant species:

1:06:38.700 --> 1:06:42.500
Calochortus albus
and Umbellularia Californica.

1:06:42.500 --> 1:06:46.600
Fairy Lantern and California Bay,
both common, flowering plants.

1:06:46.600 --> 1:06:48.800
What does it mean?

1:06:48.800 --> 1:06:50.700
That I don't know.

1:06:50.700 --> 1:06:53.900
Not part of your work,
or Professor Bressler's?

1:06:53.900 --> 1:06:55.200
No.

1:06:55.200 --> 1:06:58.600
Tell me, Martin, how close
are Professor Bressler and Prince Shada?

1:06:58.600 --> 1:07:02.300
Very close. The prince is sponsoring
the summit. They're both progressives.

1:07:02.300 --> 1:07:04.800
Bressler wants to end world hunger.

1:07:04.800 --> 1:07:07.700
He's researching new forms
of crop cultivation...

1:07:07.700 --> 1:07:10.200
...offering open access to his data.

1:07:10.200 --> 1:07:12.100
The prince funds his work.

1:07:12.100 --> 1:07:15.800
He knows the world will need food
long after his oil resources are depleted.

1:07:15.800 --> 1:07:18.300
Those agricultural patents
will be worth a fortune.

1:07:18.300 --> 1:07:20.800
But the prince's progressiveness
has cost him.

1:07:20.800 --> 1:07:23.800
Extremists in his own country
hate him...

1:07:23.800 --> 1:07:29.300
...and yet he perseveres his course,
despite multiple attempts on his life.

1:07:29.300 --> 1:07:33.000
There's a cocktail party before Bressler's
speech tonight, is that correct?

1:07:33.000 --> 1:07:35.100
Yes.

1:07:35.100 --> 1:07:38.900
For some, that might be a very good
reason to want to be you.

1:07:38.900 --> 1:07:41.500
Martin Harris with just a few guests...

1:07:41.500 --> 1:07:47.600
...in a confined space
with Prince Shada.

1:07:53.600 --> 1:07:57.000
Jurgen may be right,
but he might not be able to prove it.

1:07:57.000 --> 1:07:58.600
I need to find Liz.

1:07:58.600 --> 1:08:00.800
Oh, Martin, that is not a good idea.

1:08:00.800 --> 1:08:03.800
The people who have her
have been sticking to my schedule.

1:08:03.800 --> 1:08:05.600
I know where she'll be today.

1:08:05.600 --> 1:08:09.600
Someone will be watching her.
What if he's there?

1:08:09.600 --> 1:08:17.900
He won't be. He's me, remember?
He'll be meeting with Bressler.

1:08:58.100 --> 1:09:00.400
- Yeah?
- They just sat down.

1:09:00.400 --> 1:09:06.000
Let me know when they leave. Thanks.

1:09:44.000 --> 1:09:46.500
Okay.

1:09:54.800 --> 1:10:00.600
Please leave a message after the tone.

1:11:43.600 --> 1:11:46.000
Liz.

1:11:46.100 --> 1:11:48.000
What are you doing here?

1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:49.200
Liz. What's happening?

1:11:49.200 --> 1:11:51.600
Are you crazy?
You have to leave me alone.

1:11:51.600 --> 1:11:54.400
Why? You have to tell me why.
Are they making you do this?

1:11:54.400 --> 1:11:58.000
- Are they threatening you?
- How did you find me? Did you follow me?

1:11:58.000 --> 1:11:59.700
When we arrived, you saw the ad.

1:11:59.700 --> 1:12:02.900
You mentioned when we first saw
her show, in Chicago, together.

1:12:02.900 --> 1:12:06.800
Don't you remember?

1:12:22.800 --> 1:12:24.900
- I can't get out.
- Come with me right now.

1:12:24.900 --> 1:12:27.600
No. They'll kill us both.

1:12:27.600 --> 1:12:31.100
I never should have left you.
I never should have gotten into that taxi.

1:12:31.100 --> 1:12:33.500
You don't understand, do you?

1:12:33.500 --> 1:12:37.600
Your briefcase.
It got left behind at the airport.

1:12:37.600 --> 1:12:39.300
That's why you were going back.

1:12:39.300 --> 1:12:41.900
You need to find it.

1:12:41.900 --> 1:12:43.100
Wait for me there.

1:12:43.100 --> 1:12:46.600
Liz, Liz, wait.

1:12:59.800 --> 1:13:02.900
I love you.

1:13:12.400 --> 1:13:15.600
- What did she say?
- Not here.

1:13:15.600 --> 1:13:20.000
Where have you been? Hm?

1:13:27.600 --> 1:13:33.500
I have to go to the airport right away.

1:14:00.000 --> 1:14:01.200
Ja?

1:14:01.200 --> 1:14:03.000
- Is this Ernst Jurgen?
- Yes, it is.

1:14:03.000 --> 1:14:06.900
My name is Rodney Cole.
I received a phone message from you.

1:14:06.900 --> 1:14:11.900
And I received two from Martin as well.
What's the problem?

1:14:11.900 --> 1:14:16.200
Oh, dear. Oh, that's unbelievable.
The poor man.

1:14:16.200 --> 1:14:19.400
Well, listen, here's the good news.
I've just arrived in Berlin.

1:14:19.400 --> 1:14:23.900
Yes, I've been teaching in Leipzig,
at the Hochschule fur Technik.

1:14:23.900 --> 1:14:26.700
I'm sorry, please excuse my German.

1:14:26.700 --> 1:14:29.600
Well, I came up for the last day
to hear Bressler's speech.

1:14:29.600 --> 1:14:31.600
I could come right over.

1:14:31.600 --> 1:14:33.300
No, no, no, it's fine.

1:14:33.300 --> 1:14:38.100
It's no problem at all. It's not far.
I know exactly where you are.

1:14:38.100 --> 1:14:41.200
I look forward to meeting you, Mr. Cole.

1:14:41.200 --> 1:14:46.700
Well, then, I'll see you soon. Bye.

1:14:50.400 --> 1:14:53.600
Rodney Cole?

1:14:54.200 --> 1:14:57.000
Leipzig?

1:15:22.600 --> 1:15:23.900
Herr Jurgen?

1:15:23.900 --> 1:15:25.900
Dr. Cole.

1:15:25.900 --> 1:15:28.400
How do you do?

1:15:28.400 --> 1:15:31.400
Thank you.

1:15:38.100 --> 1:15:39.500
Drink?

1:15:39.500 --> 1:15:43.100
I have a bottle labeled brandy,
which is more than likely hair lacquer...

1:15:43.100 --> 1:15:47.400
...or some vodka my neighbor gave me
after it made her husband go blind.

1:15:47.400 --> 1:15:49.100
No, thank you.

1:15:49.100 --> 1:15:51.800
Maybe some coffee?
I'm making some for myself.

1:15:51.800 --> 1:15:56.200
No, I'm fine. Thank you.

1:16:14.000 --> 1:16:17.800
You were in the military.

1:16:17.800 --> 1:16:20.900
In the Stasi in East Germany.

1:16:20.900 --> 1:16:23.800
Well, my grandson's gonna be
very excited to hear that.

1:16:23.800 --> 1:16:26.300
He loves all this Cold War stuff.

1:16:26.300 --> 1:16:28.500
Oh, look at that.

1:16:28.500 --> 1:16:30.500
What kind of car is that?

1:16:30.500 --> 1:16:33.500
That's a Volga GAZ-24.

1:16:33.500 --> 1:16:38.200
Suspension of a donkey cart
and smelled like a tannery.

1:16:38.200 --> 1:16:43.400
Vanished as quickly as the Wall.

1:16:51.300 --> 1:16:56.500
Oh. This business with Martin
is a hell of a thing. How did he find you?

1:16:56.500 --> 1:16:58.900
Quite by chance, as it happens.

1:16:58.900 --> 1:17:03.400
I would say he was damn lucky.
How can I help?

1:17:03.400 --> 1:17:07.300
Come with us to the authorities.
Help them confirm his identity.

1:17:07.300 --> 1:17:11.300
The authorities?
Oh, Jesus. Is it that bad?

1:17:11.300 --> 1:17:16.900
I mean, a man comes to you with a story.
Why did you take his case?

1:17:16.900 --> 1:17:20.300
Eh. Curiosity.

1:17:21.100 --> 1:17:22.800
Is that all?

1:17:22.800 --> 1:17:28.700
There's not much in this world left
to interest an old spy like me.

1:17:28.700 --> 1:17:31.900
A few questions I still think over.

1:17:31.900 --> 1:17:35.200
One in particular
from when I worked for the Aufklarung...

1:17:35.200 --> 1:17:40.100
...our Foreign Intelligence wing.

1:17:40.100 --> 1:17:44.300
They used to talk about
a European-based assassination unit...

1:17:44.300 --> 1:17:47.800
...called Section 15.

1:17:47.800 --> 1:17:49.900
Freelance, deniable.

1:17:49.900 --> 1:17:52.700
They'd work for whoever would pay.

1:17:52.700 --> 1:17:55.100
Public sector, private sector.

1:17:55.100 --> 1:17:58.300
Second-to-none
in their planning and efficiency.

1:17:58.300 --> 1:18:01.300
What's more, they never failed.

1:18:01.300 --> 1:18:03.900
And I am told
they are still in existence...

1:18:03.900 --> 1:18:09.500
...but that's only rumor, of course.

1:18:10.100 --> 1:18:12.900
You had time after I called you.

1:18:12.900 --> 1:18:14.900
Why didn't you run?

1:18:14.900 --> 1:18:18.900
Where should I run from Section 15,
Mr. Cole?

1:18:18.900 --> 1:18:22.000
I can hardly walk.

1:18:22.000 --> 1:18:28.800
Before we could get Chesterfields,
I smoked 60 machorkas a day.

1:18:28.800 --> 1:18:34.200
Filthy Soviet things.
Killed more Russians than Stalin.

1:18:34.200 --> 1:18:38.400
My doctors assure me
I'll soon be joining their list of casualties.

1:18:38.400 --> 1:18:40.200
I want to know how he found you.

1:18:40.200 --> 1:18:45.100
I want every name,
every source you contacted on his behalf.

1:18:45.100 --> 1:18:48.100
And then what?

1:18:48.100 --> 1:18:53.200
We shake hands and you go away?

1:19:23.000 --> 1:19:25.800
Cyanide.

1:19:25.800 --> 1:19:31.400
You never think you'll have the courage
to use it.

1:19:31.400 --> 1:19:34.500
But you do.

1:19:34.600 --> 1:19:38.400
The best of us do.

1:19:45.700 --> 1:19:50.000
What if he remembers everything?

1:19:50.000 --> 1:19:53.000
What then?

1:20:14.900 --> 1:20:18.800
Wait, wait. Please.

1:20:20.900 --> 1:20:26.300
The combination for the lock is...

1:20:33.000 --> 1:20:36.700
Two eight zero...

1:20:38.300 --> 1:20:43.300
Two eight zero six three five.

1:21:33.500 --> 1:21:35.600
Who am I?

1:21:35.600 --> 1:21:38.200
May I?

1:21:55.900 --> 1:21:59.500
You shouldn't stay here.
It's not safe for you.

1:21:59.500 --> 1:22:04.000
Liz told me to wait here.

1:22:04.800 --> 1:22:08.800
Where are you going?

1:22:08.900 --> 1:22:12.300
You've got your life back.
I'm happy for you.

1:22:12.300 --> 1:22:14.100
Now I need to get on with mine.

1:22:14.100 --> 1:22:16.600
Gina.

1:22:31.400 --> 1:22:33.800
Thank you.

1:22:33.800 --> 1:22:35.300
It's more than I need.

1:22:35.300 --> 1:22:39.200
It's less than you deserve.
For everything you've been through.

1:22:39.200 --> 1:22:42.700
Go on, take it.

1:22:45.200 --> 1:22:47.800
What if she told them
where you were going?

1:22:47.800 --> 1:22:49.300
Liz? She wouldn't.

1:22:49.300 --> 1:22:50.500
How do you know?

1:22:50.500 --> 1:22:54.500
Gina, she's my wife.

1:22:56.400 --> 1:22:59.600
Yes, she is.

1:23:02.200 --> 1:23:06.400
It's too heavy for me.

1:23:40.800 --> 1:23:42.500
Martin.

1:23:42.500 --> 1:23:44.300
Martin.

1:23:44.300 --> 1:23:46.800
Oh, my God, look at you.
How are you doing?

1:23:46.800 --> 1:23:48.400
Rodney? What are you doing here?

1:23:48.400 --> 1:23:51.200
Well, you called me.
Don't you remember?

1:23:51.200 --> 1:23:54.700
You left a message on my machine.
I got on the first plane I could.

1:23:54.700 --> 1:23:58.500
- What have you gotten yourself into?
- I'm sorry to drag you into this, but...

1:23:58.500 --> 1:24:01.800
Don't be. We've been friends
for 15 years.

1:24:01.800 --> 1:24:07.000
I know you'd do the same for me.

1:24:21.600 --> 1:24:26.600
Let me take that for you, huh?

1:25:57.600 --> 1:25:59.500
I've never had this happen before.

1:25:59.500 --> 1:26:03.600
You really think you are Martin Harris,
don't you?

1:26:03.600 --> 1:26:06.800
What the hell, Rod?

1:26:06.800 --> 1:26:08.900
You're my oldest friend.

1:26:08.900 --> 1:26:13.500
You know who I am. It's me.
It's not this other guy. He's not...

1:26:13.500 --> 1:26:16.500
Martin Harris? No, course he's not.

1:26:16.500 --> 1:26:19.200
But, then, neither are you.

1:26:19.200 --> 1:26:23.600
- What?
- There is no Martin Harris.

1:26:23.600 --> 1:26:26.600
He doesn't exist.

1:26:26.600 --> 1:26:28.600
You invented him.

1:26:28.600 --> 1:26:30.100
He's your legend.

1:26:30.100 --> 1:26:36.100
You just made him up as a cover to get
into the conference.

1:26:36.100 --> 1:26:41.600
- You're not making sense. Liz...
- Liz.

1:26:41.600 --> 1:26:45.700
Liz is not your wife.

1:26:47.200 --> 1:26:49.000
You were a professional team.

1:26:49.000 --> 1:26:51.800
No. No, no. This is insane. She...

1:26:51.800 --> 1:26:55.100
Your memories are not real.

1:26:55.100 --> 1:26:58.300
Martin Harris is a fabrication.

1:26:58.300 --> 1:27:06.100
You just invented a life,
and then you filled in the gaps.

1:27:08.800 --> 1:27:11.100
She's right. You're really gone on this.

1:27:11.100 --> 1:27:17.500
She had to go in with a backup.
How do you think she feels?

1:27:17.500 --> 1:27:20.200
They're gonna write
a textbook on you someday.

1:27:20.200 --> 1:27:23.100
And thank you for retrieving the briefcase
from the airport.

1:27:23.100 --> 1:27:27.100
Leaving it there was untidy.

1:27:27.100 --> 1:27:31.100
It was a loose end
that didn't fit in with our plans...

1:27:31.100 --> 1:27:35.800
...and Jurgen figured us out.

1:27:35.800 --> 1:27:39.600
By the way, he's dead.

1:27:39.600 --> 1:27:42.900
And he died very well.

1:27:42.900 --> 1:27:47.900
And I'm afraid that isn't something
I'm gonna be able to say about you.

1:27:47.900 --> 1:27:50.300
I'm sorry.

1:27:50.300 --> 1:27:54.800
I'm really, really sorry.

1:28:00.000 --> 1:28:02.700
Rodney!

1:28:03.500 --> 1:28:07.800
Why are you doing this?

1:28:19.300 --> 1:28:21.800
One year of preparation.

1:28:21.800 --> 1:28:24.500
We did everything we could
to make you come back.

1:28:24.500 --> 1:28:28.200
Do you know how much time
you've wasted? It's Thanksgiving.

1:28:28.200 --> 1:28:30.900
I could've been home with my family,
having dinner...

1:28:30.900 --> 1:28:34.100
...instead of cleaning up your mess
because you bumped your head...

1:28:34.100 --> 1:28:36.200
...and started to believe your cover.

1:28:36.200 --> 1:28:38.900
Tell me...

1:28:38.900 --> 1:28:42.100
...who am I?

1:28:43.200 --> 1:28:48.900
You were a trained assassin,
and you were my best boy.

1:28:48.900 --> 1:28:56.700
And now you're just gonna be
another nameless dead junkie.

1:29:47.500 --> 1:29:51.100
Gina, stay down!

1:30:18.200 --> 1:30:21.300
Gina. Gina.

1:30:55.700 --> 1:30:58.400
No. No.

1:31:29.900 --> 1:31:31.700
"Martin Harris...

1:31:31.700 --> 1:31:38.300
...married to Elizabeth Terman,
July 18, 2006, Martha's Vineyard.

1:31:38.300 --> 1:31:41.900
Father died, September 9, 1987,
of a heart attack."

1:31:41.900 --> 1:31:49.500
I made it up. I made it up
to kill a man I've never met.

1:31:56.100 --> 1:31:59.300
Look, August 27th, the entry stamp.

1:31:59.300 --> 1:32:04.900
You were in Berlin three months ago.

1:32:06.200 --> 1:32:10.800
- Are you ready?
- Almost.

1:32:22.500 --> 1:32:25.100
Ready.

1:32:26.900 --> 1:32:30.500
Who are these people?
They can become anyone.

1:32:30.500 --> 1:32:33.100
They...

1:32:33.100 --> 1:32:36.600
We are killers.

1:32:36.800 --> 1:32:39.100
Prince Shada
is gonna be assassinated tonight.

1:32:39.100 --> 1:32:43.400
There's a bomb in his suite.
I put it there.

1:32:43.400 --> 1:32:48.100
You should've let me drown.

1:32:50.100 --> 1:32:56.100
What matters is what you do now,
Martin.

1:33:08.300 --> 1:33:12.700
Prince Shada,
are you going to stay in Berlin?

1:33:12.700 --> 1:33:15.200
Will you be funding
research at the university?

1:33:15.200 --> 1:33:19.000
Are you interested
in GM crops, Prince Shada?

1:33:19.000 --> 1:33:26.500
How long have you been
working with Professor Bressler?

1:34:02.400 --> 1:34:04.200
We're so honored you could attend.

1:34:04.200 --> 1:34:08.400
The honor is all mine.

1:34:12.700 --> 1:34:14.800
Would you like a drink?
In some circles...

1:34:14.800 --> 1:34:23.600
...my husband is more well-known
for his martinis than his research.

1:34:27.300 --> 1:34:30.800
- Do you have an invitation, sir?
- I don't know if I'm supposed to have...

1:34:30.800 --> 1:34:33.200
...an invitation.
- Leo, please, come in.

1:34:33.200 --> 1:34:35.900
I don't think you need
an invitation to your reception.

1:34:35.900 --> 1:34:37.600
Good to see you.

1:34:37.600 --> 1:34:40.800
So good to see you.
Have you met our host?

1:34:40.800 --> 1:34:43.100
- Not yet.
- Hello.

1:34:43.100 --> 1:34:48.000
Now I can see why
somebody would pretend to be him.

1:34:48.000 --> 1:34:50.900
This way.

1:34:59.700 --> 1:35:01.200
Oh, let me take that.

1:35:01.200 --> 1:35:06.600
- I'd rather hold on to this, if you don't mind.
- Oh, you can trust me, Professor.

1:35:06.600 --> 1:35:09.900
Separation anxiety.

1:35:09.900 --> 1:35:12.200
- Just leave it there, if you could.
- Of course.

1:35:12.200 --> 1:35:15.200
Thank you.

1:35:16.300 --> 1:35:18.900
Danke.

1:35:25.200 --> 1:35:27.900
Come, say hello to my friends.

1:35:27.900 --> 1:35:31.100
Danke schon.

1:35:32.600 --> 1:35:36.000
Oh, excuse me.

1:36:19.200 --> 1:36:22.100
It's you.

1:36:23.000 --> 1:36:25.600
I am not so sure about that.

1:36:25.600 --> 1:36:29.300
Many of my relatives would not agree.

1:36:29.300 --> 1:36:32.200
This way.

1:36:36.200 --> 1:36:40.300
Get your hands off her!

1:36:40.300 --> 1:36:44.000
Okay, I'm coming.

1:37:18.400 --> 1:37:22.300
There's a bomb in the Eisenhower suite.
I put it there three months ago!

1:37:22.300 --> 1:37:24.600
Now you are saying you are
Dr. Martin Harris?

1:37:24.600 --> 1:37:25.900
You're not listening!

1:37:25.900 --> 1:37:28.800
Take me to the room.
I'll show you exactly where it is.

1:37:28.800 --> 1:37:31.800
Up to the room, in the middle of a party
with Prince Shada...

1:37:31.800 --> 1:37:42.300
...and the world's leading scientific minds?
Of course, why didn't you say so before?

1:37:46.200 --> 1:37:50.500
I'm not lying! Pull up the reception
recordings from August 27th of this year.

1:37:50.500 --> 1:37:56.000
Do it now, or many people will die!

1:38:03.200 --> 1:38:09.800
- Excuse me, I'm going to grab my bag.
- Sure.

1:38:13.400 --> 1:38:18.300
Here. Why don't you just wear it?
Like some nerdy accessory?

1:38:18.300 --> 1:38:20.600
Oh.

1:38:21.200 --> 1:38:24.200
Thank you.

1:38:32.200 --> 1:38:35.600
- That's got all your secrets in it, right?
- If you'd like to say so...

1:38:35.600 --> 1:38:41.700
Would you excuse me?
I have to go check on something.

1:38:41.700 --> 1:38:45.100
Stop. Stop. That's it.

1:38:45.100 --> 1:38:50.000
Do you see? Look! Do you see?

1:39:04.500 --> 1:39:06.200
Attention, attention...

1:39:06.200 --> 1:39:14.000
...could all guests leave the hotel
by the front entrance?

1:39:14.700 --> 1:39:17.700
- Shit.
- Attention, attention...

1:39:17.700 --> 1:39:21.600
...could all guests leave the hotel by the
front entrance?

1:39:21.600 --> 1:39:23.100
Find the target. Finish it.

1:39:23.100 --> 1:39:26.700
We got what we came for.
I'm going to take care of the bomb.

1:39:26.700 --> 1:39:29.100
- Forget about it.
- They have my image on file...

1:39:29.100 --> 1:39:30.800
...from when we planted it.
- So?

1:39:30.800 --> 1:39:34.300
I don't want my face connected
to an explosion we no longer need.

1:39:34.300 --> 1:39:36.600
Go!

1:39:45.200 --> 1:39:47.700
Lily, Laurel.

1:39:47.700 --> 1:39:52.200
Bressler's girls. Lily, Laurel.
Flowering plants.

1:39:52.200 --> 1:39:55.200
Calochortus albus
and Umbellularia Californica.

1:39:55.200 --> 1:39:57.100
The code, from the book.

1:39:57.100 --> 1:40:01.300
They're his passwords.

1:40:02.300 --> 1:40:05.200
Bressler's supposedly working
on a new strain of corn.

1:40:05.200 --> 1:40:08.300
One that can grow in any climate.
It's revolutionary.

1:40:08.300 --> 1:40:10.600
If they access his research
and kill him...

1:40:10.600 --> 1:40:16.200
...it could be worth billions
in the wrong hands.

1:40:16.200 --> 1:40:19.100
Laurel! Laurel!

1:40:19.100 --> 1:40:21.900
- Papa!
- Laurel!

1:40:21.900 --> 1:40:25.000
That bomb goes off, it'll look as if
Shada was killed by extremists.

1:40:25.000 --> 1:40:28.300
The prince was never the target.
It's Bressler.

1:40:28.300 --> 1:40:32.300
Listen, listen! You have to tell Strauss,
they're after Bressler!

1:40:32.300 --> 1:40:36.100
Do you understand?

1:40:37.600 --> 1:40:40.100
Go! Go!

1:40:40.100 --> 1:40:44.800
Out of the way! Move! Move!

1:40:46.200 --> 1:40:49.800
- Laurel! Laurel!
- Papa!

1:40:49.800 --> 1:40:53.300
Laurel! Laurel!

1:41:08.200 --> 1:41:11.200
Oh, Laurel.

1:41:11.200 --> 1:41:13.700
Papa!

1:41:15.000 --> 1:41:17.200
She was wandering around,
looking for you.

1:41:17.200 --> 1:41:18.700
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1:41:18.700 --> 1:41:23.800
- We have to leave.
- Yes, yes.

1:42:06.300 --> 1:42:13.400
Christ, you really don't
remember anything, do you?

1:42:50.800 --> 1:42:52.300
This'll be at the party...

1:42:52.300 --> 1:42:54.800
...where we'll access Bressler's computer
and steal his files.

1:42:54.800 --> 1:42:57.000
The client wants this clean.

1:42:57.000 --> 1:43:00.300
He wants the material from Bressler's
computer and Bressler dead.

1:43:00.300 --> 1:43:02.100
No one can ever know what happened.

1:43:02.100 --> 1:43:05.300
When the bomb goes off,
it'll appear that Shada was the target...

1:43:05.300 --> 1:43:10.100
...and that Bressler
was collateral damage.

1:43:10.100 --> 1:43:13.300
Looks great.

1:43:16.800 --> 1:43:20.800
Time for the A team?

1:43:46.800 --> 1:43:49.000
I didn't forget everything.

1:43:49.000 --> 1:43:54.600
I remember how to kill you, asshole.

1:46:44.500 --> 1:46:47.900
Less than 24 hours
after the failed assassination attempt...

1:46:47.900 --> 1:46:49.200
...on the Saudi prince...

1:46:49.200 --> 1:46:52.500
...Nobel laureate Professor Leo Bressler
announced the development...

1:46:52.500 --> 1:46:54.700
...of a new strain of corn...

1:46:54.700 --> 1:46:59.200
...fast-growing, self-propagating,
drought-tolerant, and pest-resistant...

1:46:59.200 --> 1:47:03.500
...to be made available worldwide
without patent or copyright costs.

1:47:03.500 --> 1:47:07.600
We have made the genetic map
of this new sustenance available to all.

1:47:07.600 --> 1:47:12.600
It's a gift. It's a gift from Prince Shada
and from science to mankind.

1:47:12.600 --> 1:47:16.300
Humanitarian organizations
applauded the announcement...

1:47:16.300 --> 1:47:19.400
...but agri-business companies
were taken by surprise...

1:47:19.400 --> 1:47:22.500
...and watched as stocks plunged
14 percent.

1:47:22.500 --> 1:47:25.600

And in other news, the European
Parliament today passed legislation...

1:47:29.300 --> 1:47:32.900
...to remove trade tariffs
on imported African rice...

1:47:32.900 --> 1:47:41.900
...with 582 members of the 736-seat body
voting to ratify the measure.

1:47:44.400 --> 1:47:50.800
Hey. Now you're free
to do whatever you want.

1:47:50.800 --> 1:47:53.600

1:47:58.500 --> 1:48:01.400
Henry. Henry Taylor.
