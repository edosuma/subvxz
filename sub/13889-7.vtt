(RIMMER) What happened?
(LISTER) They're frozen on the spot.

00:11.326 --> 00:14.489
Yvonne McGruder did this
when I tried to kiss her.

00:14.663 --> 00:17.063
This'll drive them crazy!

00:19.601 --> 00:23.162
This machine digitises time -
we can release jets of it.

00:31.313 --> 00:34.510
It's restored your hair to a previous time period.

00:34.683 --> 00:36.480
It was an accident.

00:39.287 --> 00:40.879
Hot Bovril.

00:42.190 --> 00:44.181
Agh!

00:45.493 --> 00:48.428
- Fix him with the time wand.
- Watch this.

00:55.103 --> 00:57.333
And this is Pete.

00:58.139 --> 01:01.438
The excitement of being free has killed him!

01:01.610 --> 01:05.842
He really loved that bird.
It was the only thing that kept him going.

01:06.014 --> 01:11.816
I think the time wand could bring Pete back
to life - make him young and strong again.

01:11.987 --> 01:13.477
Watch.

02:05.874 --> 02:09.241
From Pete, sir. Birds are descended
from dinosaurs.

02:09.411 --> 02:13.370
I inadvertently reversed evolution
several million years.

02:13.548 --> 02:14.947

03:40.568 --> 03:44.971
- We've lost the time wand.
- How are we gonna get rid of that thing now?

We're finished!

Stop yelling. Let's think our way out of this.

We're finished!

03:53.982 --> 03:56.007
Shut up and get a grip, man.

03:56.184 --> 03:59.950
I'm sorry. It's just I was...
Look, I'm better now.

04:00.121 --> 04:02.351
- Can I just say one thing?
- Go on.

04:02.524 --> 04:04.685
We're finished!

04:04.859 --> 04:08.852
Hol, we've been cornered
by a T. Rex that was formerly a sparrow.

04:09.030 --> 04:13.763
The only thing that can turn it back into a bird
is in its stomach. Any ideas?

04:13.935 --> 04:17.598
- <i>Do you want the long or the short version?</i>
- Ooh... Long.

04:17.772 --> 04:19.262
<i>You're finished.</i>

04:25.513 --> 04:27.105
What's the short version?

04:27.282 --> 04:29.045
<i>Bye.</i>

04:31.486 --> 04:32.885
- Kryten.
- Yes, ma'am?

04:33.054 --> 04:38.185
How long will it take for Pete
to pass the time wand out of his system?

04:39.694 --> 04:42.492
I don't have that information in my database.

04:42.664 --> 04:45.132
My programmers, for some insane reason,

04:45.300 --> 04:50.738
believed dinosaur bowel movement
frequency tables wouldn't be required. Imbeciles!

04:50.905 --> 04:52.532
What's your suggestion?

04:52.707 --> 04:58.339
The quicker we get the time wand back,
the better, right? So why don't we lure Pete

04:58.513 --> 05:02.244
into the food bay
and get him to eat some roughage?

05:02.417 --> 05:05.215
Get a T. Rex to eat roughage?

05:05.386 --> 05:09.345
Yeah! All Bran, prunes, baked beans on toast.
That sort of stuff.

05:09.524 --> 05:12.982
We can't get Lister to eat that,
let alone a dinosaur.

05:13.161 --> 05:16.653
The more roughage,
the quicker we get the time wand back.

05:16.831 --> 05:19.322
- Have you got a better idea?
- Yes, I have.

05:19.500 --> 05:21.297
I'm going to kill myself.

05:22.103 --> 05:25.095
(ROARING)

05:25.273 --> 05:29.334
We've got to keep
this dinosaur business quiet or we're dead.

05:29.510 --> 05:33.105
Keep him quiet?
He's rampaging about the food decks,

05:33.281 --> 05:37.081
making more noise
than two yodelling champions on honeymoon.

05:37.252 --> 05:41.416
- Everyone will have heard him by now.
- But, sir, the crew are frozen,

05:41.589 --> 05:44.023
operating on a different time stream.

05:44.192 --> 05:48.288
If we can turn Pete back into a sparrow
before the freeze expires,

05:48.463 --> 05:51.523
- no one need be any the wiser.
- He's right.

05:51.699 --> 05:56.534
I listened to everything he said,
and I still ain't got a clue what's happening.

05:56.704 --> 05:58.695
(ROARS)

06:16.424 --> 06:18.415
(KRYTEN) Right over, sir.

06:19.627 --> 06:20.924
Right over.

06:27.902 --> 06:29.836
Cow vindaloo?

06:30.004 --> 06:32.029
It's not gonna work.

06:32.206 --> 06:35.733
- Of course it's gonna work.
- T. Rexes don't like curry.

06:35.910 --> 06:39.437
They're hard, aren't they?
Of course they like curries!

06:39.614 --> 06:42.048
If a T. Rex was a bloke, he'd be a Geordie -

06:42.216 --> 06:47.381
the kind of guy who wears T-shirts in winter
and his nipples don't even get hard.

06:49.891 --> 06:55.352
A seven-ton theropod is not gonna eat
Indian food. They like flesh, preferably living,

06:55.530 --> 07:00.024
liberally coated in blood with a side order
of intestines and extra blood -

07:00.201 --> 07:03.602
a bit like the French in that respect.

07:04.605 --> 07:06.266
We've got nothing to lose.

07:06.441 --> 07:11.242
If the worst comes to the worst
and the dino doesn't eat it, I'll scoff it meself.

07:11.412 --> 07:13.403
(ROARS)

07:13.581 --> 07:18.416
- That door won't hold out much longer.
- If only that T. Rex felt like I do now.

07:18.586 --> 07:21.214
He wouldn't even need a curry.

07:27.028 --> 07:31.658
- Don't put that stuff in. You'll spoil the taste.
- Right. Here he comes.

07:53.788 --> 07:56.655
Maybe we should have made some poppadoms.

07:56.824 --> 07:58.655
Gone the whole hog.

07:58.826 --> 08:00.191
A whole hog?

08:00.361 --> 08:04.127

The rules on dinosaurs

09:07.295 --> 09:09.855
No pets. Am I right?

09:10.631 --> 09:12.098
Am I right?!

09:12.266 --> 09:15.360
- Yes, sir.
- Have you any idea

09:15.536 --> 09:18.835
- the damage that thing has caused?
- No, sir.

09:19.006 --> 09:25.707
It has eaten our entire supply -
two and a half tons - of mint-choc ice cream.

09:26.814 --> 09:32.275
I love mint-choc ice cream,
and that damn dino has eaten every last bit.

09:32.453 --> 09:38.949
- We just wanted the time wand back, sir.
- It's also eaten 400 crates of orange ice pops,

09:39.127 --> 09:41.152
and drunk all the Coca Cola.

09:41.329 --> 09:42.660
Guess what.

09:42.830 --> 09:48.427
- You love orange ice pops and Coca Cola.
- I LOVE orange ice pops and Coca Cola!

09:48.603 --> 09:49.968
If you just let us...

09:50.138 --> 09:54.666
Do you know what happens
when a dinosaur eats cow vindaloo,

09:54.842 --> 09:59.074
then eats two and a half tons
of mint-choc ice cream,

09:59.247 --> 10:02.444
followed by 400 crates of orange ice pops,

10:02.617 --> 10:08.317
and swills the whole thing down
with 2,000 gallons of a popular fizzy drink?

10:08.489 --> 10:10.252
Do you know what happens?

10:11.259 --> 10:12.851
It burps?

10:13.027 --> 10:14.494
Oh, it burps!

10:15.363 --> 10:18.594
And do you know what happened
to the poor, brave men

10:18.766 --> 10:21.963
who had the misfortune
to get in the way of that burp?

10:22.970 --> 10:24.961
They went, "Phwoar!"

10:27.208 --> 10:29.472
It took out the entire platoon,

10:29.644 --> 10:33.512
hurling them 20 feet across the cargo bay wall.

10:33.681 --> 10:39.483
I hope this one small dinosaur incident
won't tarnish an otherwise flawless record, sir.

10:40.688 --> 10:45.284
Do you know what happens
when a dinosaur eats cow vindaloo,

10:45.459 --> 10:48.121
two and a half tons of mint-choc ice cream,

10:48.296 --> 10:51.129
followed by 400 crates of orange ice pops,

10:51.299 --> 10:57.568
and swills it all down with 2,000 gallons
of a popular fizzy drink AFTER it's burped?

10:58.372 --> 10:59.930
- It feels sick?
- Oh, no.

11:00.708 --> 11:02.801
It doesn't FEEL sick, Rimmer.

11:02.977 --> 11:04.968
It IS sick.

11:05.146 --> 11:09.082
Five of our best men nearly drowned.

11:09.884 --> 11:11.681
Two others are in hospital,

11:11.852 --> 11:16.016
concussed by pieces of carrot
the size of tree trunks.

11:17.458 --> 11:21.053
We are really deeply, deeply, deeply sorry, sir.

11:25.366 --> 11:29.735
then eats two and a half tons
of mint-choc ice cream followed by...

11:29.904 --> 11:32.964
- Oh, God, it didn't!
- It didn't what, Lister?

11:33.140 --> 11:36.735
It didn't get a diarrhoea attack, did it?

11:36.911 --> 11:39.175
100 per cent correct!

11:40.147 --> 11:45.380
And do you know what happened to the
battalion that was sneaking up on the beast?

11:45.553 --> 11:47.646
From behind?

11:47.822 --> 11:50.848
Of which I was a proud member?

11:51.025 --> 11:52.754
Do you know?

11:52.927 --> 11:55.088
Do you know what happened?

11:56.063 --> 11:58.964
- I've got a fair idea, sir.
- A fair idea, sir.

11:59.133 --> 12:00.828
A tidal wave.

12:01.002 --> 12:03.562
15 feet high.

12:03.738 --> 12:09.973
I will be in therapy for the rest of my life.
I've had 12 baths and three showers.

12:10.144 --> 12:13.170
Now, do you have anything to say?

12:13.347 --> 12:16.441
I think you missed a bit
up your left nostril, sir.

12:20.021 --> 12:22.319
Nobody knows how to work this thing.

12:22.490 --> 12:26.722
It is sedated in the cargo bay.
Turn it back into a sparrow.

12:26.894 --> 12:30.796
Sir, what about Bob? Did he show up?

12:30.965 --> 12:34.594
Who the hell do you think landed on my head?

12:34.769 --> 12:36.760
He is in repairs, being oiled.

12:36.937 --> 12:40.100
Bring back the sparrow.

12:40.708 --> 12:45.236
- And if you try anything smart, you're dead.
- Yes, sir.

12:45.413 --> 12:51.318
And if I ever, ever, ever see you
in this office again,

12:51.485 --> 12:53.976
you are finished.

12:55.122 --> 12:57.022

13:26.921 --> 13:29.048
Did you get punishment duty, too?

13:29.223 --> 13:33.159
I've got to iron 800 prison smocks.
I don't understand.

13:33.327 --> 13:36.956
Why do you get punishment duty
and I get a reward?

13:37.131 --> 13:39.998
800! Bliss!

13:40.167 --> 13:41.794
Did you see the captain's report?

13:42.603 --> 13:44.366
The one lying open on his desk.

13:44.538 --> 13:50.238
Did you see what it said about you? It used
the word "imbecile" four times in one sentence.

13:50.411 --> 13:53.869
Oh, yeah? What were the other words
in the sentence?

13:54.048 --> 13:55.481
Just your name and a dash.

13:58.953 --> 14:03.720
You make two tiny mistakes - give the captain
a virus that eats all his hair off,

14:03.891 --> 14:06.257
turn a sparrow into a dinosaur -

14:06.427 --> 14:08.895
and you never hear the last of it!

14:09.063 --> 14:14.330
(SIGHS) He really thinks I'm an imbecile? I'm
never going to make it into high command now.

14:14.502 --> 14:17.494
Only people who know you
think you're an imbecile.

14:17.671 --> 14:19.901
Everyone else thinks you're a moron.

14:21.242 --> 14:25.372
He is a good captain, though, Captain Hollister -
on the ball. Quick.

14:25.546 --> 14:29.642
Quick? The only time he's quick
is when he's passing a salad bar.

14:32.286 --> 14:35.551
- You do admire him, though, don't ya?
- Admire him?

14:35.723 --> 14:39.989
A man who has his own cinema
pick and mix factory in his quarters?

14:40.161 --> 14:42.686
A man who has a walk-in fridge?

14:42.863 --> 14:46.822
Who lists as his hobbies,
chewing and swallowing?

14:47.001 --> 14:51.495
You did tell me once before, though,
you respect HIM, don't ya?

14:51.672 --> 14:52.969
Respect him?

14:53.140 --> 14:57.668
A man whose family crest is made
up of two cream buns and a profiterole?

14:57.845 --> 15:00.780
A man who... He's standing behind me, isn't he?

15:00.948 --> 15:02.381
Yes, he is.

15:04.251 --> 15:09.154
I was just talking about you, sir. I was saying
what a big fat lump of blubber you are

15:09.323 --> 15:13.851
and how that potato virus I contracted yesterday
has had no side effects.

15:14.028 --> 15:17.020
(JABBERS)

15:23.971 --> 15:27.338
You forgot this. You left it in my office.

15:27.508 --> 15:32.912
Do you have any idea the damage that
this could cause if it got into the wrong hands?

15:33.080 --> 15:35.014
Look after it!

15:50.064 --> 15:55.764
You're there. I know you're there,
you little sod! Come on. Out! Out!

15:58.973 --> 16:02.238
There's a mouse under here.
It's been scuttling around.

16:02.409 --> 16:05.378
- It's not a mouse, ma'am. It's Archie.
- Archie?

16:05.546 --> 16:08.037
My penis. It must have escaped.

16:11.852 --> 16:15.948
I must get my ears syringed.
Do you know what that sounded like to me?

16:16.123 --> 16:18.683
I made one.

16:19.560 --> 16:24.088
Forget my ears. Maybe my whole brain
needs syringing. You made one?

16:24.265 --> 16:26.495
Out of an electron board, a loo roll,

16:26.667 --> 16:31.161
some sticky-backed plastic
and an Action Man's polo-neck jumper.

16:31.338 --> 16:33.203
Kryten, why do you want one?

16:33.374 --> 16:39.370
It's so humiliating being posted to the women's
wing just because I'm genitally challenged,

16:39.547 --> 16:41.515
so I made one like Mr Lister's.

16:41.682 --> 16:45.880
The little rascal must have got bored
jumping in and out of his hoop.

16:46.053 --> 16:51.013
No wonder I couldn't lure him out with cheese.
This whole thing's making sense now.

16:51.191 --> 16:54.388
Leave this to me, ma'am.
Here, Archie. Here, boy.

16:54.562 --> 16:56.052
Chook-chook-chook.

17:11.444 --> 17:14.436
- Do you realise what this means?
- No, ma'am.

17:14.615 --> 17:16.913
- It means you're a real man.
- Why?

17:17.084 --> 17:20.713
Because, like all men,
you have no control over your penis.

17:23.857 --> 17:26.451
I'm so proud! Archie, come back!

17:28.629 --> 17:31.655
All right, girls? New Canary mission.

17:31.832 --> 17:34.801
- What?
- Untamed dino on the loose.

17:38.472 --> 17:41.839
We're not going in
till we know what we're doing.

17:42.009 --> 17:43.670
That could take years.

17:43.844 --> 17:48.178
Point that thing at yourself by mistake
and you could wind up as a sperm.

17:48.349 --> 17:50.408
- Is that what you want?
- Hell, no!

17:50.584 --> 17:52.484
None of my suits will fit!

17:53.087 --> 17:57.524
If that gizmo thing don't work,
Captain says we've gotta get that T. Rex.

17:57.691 --> 18:00.888
- We ain't using no guns.
- Guns are for wusses.

18:01.061 --> 18:03.894
It's gonna be hand-to-hand combat.

18:06.700 --> 18:09.066
A fist fight with a T. Rex?

18:10.204 --> 18:15.767
Yeah, but them T. Rexes, mate, they only got
little arms. They ain't got no reach.

18:15.943 --> 18:17.934
I'll just pick it off.

18:22.583 --> 18:28.283
- Can't reach anything with them little arms.
- That's probably why they're a bit grumpy.

18:44.104 --> 18:45.969
- Oh, my God!
- What?

18:46.140 --> 18:48.836
- Something's wrong!
- What do you mean, man?

18:49.009 --> 18:51.944
Something's inside me and it wants to get out!

18:52.112 --> 18:53.977
Agh!

18:54.148 --> 18:56.514
Help!

18:56.684 --> 18:58.675
(TRILLING)

18:59.987 --> 19:02.683
- What is it?
- I think it's Archie, sir.

19:05.659 --> 19:08.184
- It's who?
- He probably followed us.

19:08.362 --> 19:12.128
He must have dozed off
in the Cat's pocket and just woke up.

19:12.299 --> 19:13.789
Who the smeg is Archie?

19:13.967 --> 19:17.926
Don't be alarmed, sir.
It's just my penis is on the loose.

19:18.105 --> 19:20.573
(CAT YELLS)

19:24.611 --> 19:26.875
(YELLING)

19:29.083 --> 19:32.018
We wanna barney with Barney.

19:32.186 --> 19:34.950
Don't want any sane people spoiling it.

19:35.122 --> 19:37.784
Death or glory. Yee-hah!

19:38.659 --> 19:40.559
Hang on, guys. Wait a minute.

19:45.532 --> 19:48.558
(GRUNTS)

19:48.736 --> 19:50.727
This thing's useless.

19:51.772 --> 19:54.002
Say goodbye to your teeth!

19:55.242 --> 19:56.573
Agh!

19:57.578 --> 20:00.809
We're getting our butts kicked
and it doesn't hurt.

20:02.850 --> 20:04.841
See? I'm not even bleeding.

20:07.054 --> 20:08.453
You're right.

20:19.500 --> 20:23.561
They put your bodies
on a different time stream to the rest of you.

20:23.737 --> 20:25.466
Let's go!

20:45.125 --> 20:48.117
You lost the time wand?

20:49.029 --> 20:51.554
- We were ambushed, sir.
- By whom?

20:51.732 --> 20:54.394
- First of all by...
- (RIMMER PROTESTS)

20:54.568 --> 20:57.503
- Then we were jumped by... Sir.
- (PROTESTS)

20:58.939 --> 21:00.372
That's it?

21:00.541 --> 21:05.569
OK. No more Mr Nice Guy.
No more second chances.

21:05.746 --> 21:09.204
You get that time wand back.
You get that sparrow back.

21:09.383 --> 21:11.874
And if you step outta line one more time,

21:12.052 --> 21:14.077
one more time,

21:14.254 --> 21:16.449
you're dead, do you understand?

21:27.367 --> 21:28.766
What was that?

21:28.936 --> 21:31.166
I feel... Ooh!

21:38.445 --> 21:40.675
What the hell is going on?

21:42.816 --> 21:45.649
The effects of the fight have caught up with us.

21:48.288 --> 21:50.620
Get out of here, both of you!

21:50.791 --> 21:52.782
Out!

21:55.462 --> 21:57.453
Agh!

22:06.540 --> 22:09.600
Getting that time wand back could take for ever.

22:09.776 --> 22:12.836
They can zap us with it
and turn us into anything.

22:15.849 --> 22:19.307
I don't think getting it back
is gonna be much of a problem.

22:19.486 --> 22:22.011
(GRUNTING)

22:31.431 --> 22:33.899
(GENTLE SNORING)

22:34.067 --> 22:38.766
- (RIMMER) It's going to go wrong, isn't it?
- I've just got to press "Undo".

22:38.939 --> 22:43.603
The time wand will undo everything it's done.
We'll even get Birdman back.

22:43.777 --> 22:47.144
- Something's gonna go wrong.
- Will you relax?

22:51.551 --> 22:53.075
Birdman's boots.

22:53.253 --> 22:55.813
Now to get the rest of him back.

22:59.960 --> 23:01.951
Pete ate me!

23:02.129 --> 23:04.097
He ate me!

23:04.865 --> 23:08.961
He must be really out of sorts.
He's never eaten me before.

23:09.136 --> 23:10.933
Never.

23:14.174 --> 23:15.573
Pete!

23:15.742 --> 23:18.176
- (TWEETING)
- Do you want some seed?

23:19.346 --> 23:22.873
- Now destroy the time wand.
- This machine's priceless.

23:23.050 --> 23:25.041
Destroy it.

23:47.941 --> 23:50.307
(CRACKING)

23:51.311 --> 23:53.040
What are we gonna do now?

23:53.213 --> 23:56.705
Now rebuild the time wand.

23:56.883 --> 23:58.874
It's absolutely priceless!

24:24.711 --> 24:26.338
Stop that dinosaur!

24:27.814 --> 24:30.840
- It's gone in the lift!
- Get it back!

24:32.386 --> 24:35.184
Oh! That coconut milk felt great.

24:44.664 --> 24:46.996
Oh, I'm such a wreck!

24:59.880 --> 25:01.905
(MOANS)

25:02.082 --> 25:03.777
Whoa!

25:03.950 --> 25:06.851
(MOANS) That's great.

25:09.890 --> 25:15.522
Oh! There's a certain roughness
about your touch that really hits the spot!

25:15.695 --> 25:18.823
(BELLOWING ROAR)

25:57.737 --> 25:59.261
The hole, sir.

26:12.285 --> 26:15.812
<i>(SONG) It's cold outside,</i>
<i>there's no kind of atmosphere</i>

26:15.989 --> 26:19.117
<i>I'm all alone, more or less</i>

26:19.292 --> 26:22.455
<i>Let me fly far away from here</i>

26:22.629 --> 26:25.325
<i>Fun, fun, fun</i>

26:25.499 --> 26:29.230
<i>In the sun, sun, sun</i>

26:29.402 --> 26:32.735
<i>I want to lie, shipwrecked and comatose</i>

26:32.906 --> 26:35.875
<i>Drinking fresh mango juice</i>

26:36.042 --> 26:39.307
