WEBVTT

00:00.583 --> 00:03.458
[answering machine] Ms. Newly,
Jemma at Marapolla Spa.

00:03.458 --> 00:06.125
It's come to our attention
you accidentally took home

00:06.125 --> 00:08.125
a pair of our courtesy
flip-flops,

00:08.125 --> 00:11.083
and unless you return these
and the last three...

00:11.083 --> 00:14.834
[man] Hi, this is Brian. I met
you at that party, and you
tried on my hat.

00:14.834 --> 00:19.875
Remember? I said you looked
cute in it, but that didn't
mean you could keep it.

00:19.875 --> 00:21.959
[Samantha] Fun fact
about Samantha Newly:

00:21.959 --> 00:24.875
Before my amnesia
everyone hated me.

00:24.875 --> 00:27.542
Except a few people,
like these two.

00:27.542 --> 00:31.125
A childhood friend and, for
some reason, my ex-boyfriend.

00:31.125 --> 00:36.166
So... I haven't seen you
since we were at the hospital.

00:36.166 --> 00:40.792
Hanging out, waiting for Sam
to wake up out of her coma.

00:40.792 --> 00:42.000
Yeah.

00:43.625 --> 00:47.000
Good times, huh?

00:47.000 --> 00:49.959
[woman] I told you
I was pregnant in confidence.

00:49.959 --> 00:52.000
Who does that to another
person?

00:52.000 --> 00:54.458
[man] Rest assured
you'll hear from my law...

00:54.458 --> 00:56.458
[woman] They had to drain
the entire pool.

00:56.458 --> 00:58.667
[man] You knew
I was allergic to nuts.

00:58.667 --> 01:01.917
- OK! OK! I get it! I get it!
- [male voice] Record greeting.

01:01.917 --> 01:05.625
[screaming] I'm sorry!

01:05.625 --> 01:09.000
[continues screaming]

01:12.667 --> 01:14.917
Leave a message
after the beep.

01:14.917 --> 01:15.959
[beep]

01:24.166 --> 01:26.500
I am not gonna check
the machine anymore.

01:26.500 --> 01:28.542
If people want to find me,
hunt me down.

01:28.542 --> 01:30.917
- Yeah.
- No. No, that's not good.

01:30.917 --> 01:34.792
But those people don't know
the new you. I'm having
a great time with you.

01:34.792 --> 01:36.917
- You know, hanging out.
- Kicking it.

01:36.917 --> 01:40.041
- BFFs.
- Step off biotch,
I'll cap yo ass.

01:40.041 --> 01:43.917
I have no idea where that
just came from. I meant
to say, "Yes, me too."

01:43.917 --> 01:48.917
Ms. Newly, the tailor
dropped something off
for you. I'll get it.

01:48.917 --> 01:52.333
So how did it happen anyway?
I mean, how did you and
I drift apart?

01:52.333 --> 01:54.667
Oh, you know
how it is with kids.

01:54.667 --> 01:57.834
One day you're climbing into
each other's bedroom windows

01:57.834 --> 02:01.583
late at night and sharing
secrets and drinking cocoa.

02:01.583 --> 02:03.166
Oh, yeah.

02:03.166 --> 02:06.917
You know, and the next day one
of you stands up the other one

02:06.917 --> 02:08.875
at McCorkle's Beef Grindery

02:08.875 --> 02:12.917
to go ice skating with
the eighth-grade cheerleaders.

02:12.917 --> 02:15.917
- Oh, Dena, I'm really...
- Don't say anything.

02:15.917 --> 02:19.417
- I'll just call your machine.
- Yeah.

02:19.417 --> 02:21.709
- Here you are.
- Oh.

02:24.542 --> 02:26.375
Althea's Bridal.

02:27.250 --> 02:28.917
It's a bridesmaid's dress!

02:28.917 --> 02:31.000
- I'm a bridesmaid?
- I think so!

02:31.000 --> 02:33.625
- In a wedding?
- I think so!

02:33.625 --> 02:36.625
Who is this? Did the tailor
know? Did they say anything?

02:36.625 --> 02:39.250
You should ignore
the warning on the plastic bag.

02:39.250 --> 02:41.000
Feel free to use it
as a toy.

02:43.166 --> 02:46.166
[whistling]

02:46.166 --> 02:49.166
Where's all that mail that
I brought back from Todd's?

02:49.166 --> 02:52.959
- On your bed.
Don't run in the house!
- She's a bridesmaid.

02:52.959 --> 02:54.959
- In a wedding?
- Yeah.

02:54.959 --> 02:57.875
- Someone liked her?
- Yes, Mother, it is possible.

02:57.875 --> 03:00.208
Despite my upbringing.

03:00.208 --> 03:03.000
Dena. Look, there's
the bathroom that I want.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.875
Well, we don't need
a new bathroom. Ours is fine.

03:05.875 --> 03:09.250
But we can afford it.
And I want one.

03:09.250 --> 03:12.458
When we built this house, the
plumbing was state-of-the-art.

03:12.458 --> 03:14.417
Well, so was yours.
Things change.

03:14.417 --> 03:16.542
I found it!
I found the invitation.

03:16.542 --> 03:21.458
Valerie Bromquist and Trey
Wells. Who are they? Anyone?
Anyone?

03:21.458 --> 03:24.083
Well, I knew
a Trevor Chadney once.

03:24.083 --> 03:27.625
"You are cordially invited to...
special lodging rates,

03:27.625 --> 03:28.917
salmon or beef..."

03:28.917 --> 03:30.959
Here. OK, the date is...

03:31.959 --> 03:34.500
Of course. It's today.

03:34.500 --> 03:39.083
- You're never gonna make it.
- No? Watch me.
Somebody likes me.

03:39.083 --> 03:42.917
It is an honor to be asked.
I am not gonna let down
my friend Victoria.

03:42.917 --> 03:44.917
- Valerie.
- Whatever.

03:44.917 --> 03:48.500
It's at the Hyperion Hotel.
These people must be loaded.

03:48.500 --> 03:51.750
Look at the wedding party rates.
That is really reasonable.

03:51.750 --> 03:55.208
Holy cow! With my hotel points,
it's almost free.

03:55.208 --> 03:58.125
- I always wanted to stay there.
- We have to stay there.

03:58.125 --> 04:01.166
- We can't afford not to.
- OK, then we're all gonna go.

04:01.166 --> 04:04.709
But you've got to go. Get ready.
Get ready. Go, go. All right.

04:04.709 --> 04:06.959
- Dena, you're gonna be my date.
- Me?

04:08.542 --> 04:11.583
If I die tomorrow,
I'll die a happy girl.

04:11.583 --> 04:13.834
Unless it's from
something painful.

04:13.834 --> 04:15.959
Or slow like
being dragged by a train.

04:15.959 --> 04:19.291
[violins playing]

04:19.291 --> 04:21.208
Oh, good,
they haven't started yet.

04:21.208 --> 04:24.500
All right, I'm gonna go try
to find Veronica. No, wait...

04:24.500 --> 04:27.917
V, V... Vancouver, Valedictor...
Valerie! Valerie.

04:27.917 --> 04:30.917
All right, you go find a seat.
Mom, Dad, you take the bags up,

04:30.917 --> 04:33.458
and I'll see you later.
All right?

04:33.458 --> 04:37.333
OK. I don't know why
you won't let a bellman
help you with those.

04:37.333 --> 04:40.583
No way. That's how
these places get you.

04:40.583 --> 04:42.917
What do I look like,
some kind of rube?

04:46.625 --> 04:48.917
Todd?

04:48.917 --> 04:52.500
- Sam?
- Oh, no,
we were invited together.

04:52.500 --> 04:56.083
God, that's so sweet of you
to still come, but you know,
I brought Dena.

04:56.083 --> 04:59.166
And, oh,
this is so awkward... for you.

04:59.166 --> 05:02.792
I'm the photographer.
You got me this job.
What are you doing here?

05:02.792 --> 05:04.500
- Sam?
- Andrea!

05:04.500 --> 05:07.458
- What are you doing here?
- Why does everyone ask me that?

05:07.458 --> 05:10.458
I am obviously
in the wedding.

05:10.458 --> 05:13.500
I don't want to embarrass
myself. I need to find the
bride.

05:13.500 --> 05:15.125
Valerie. [yelps]

05:16.291 --> 05:18.583
[Valerie] Get that bitch
out of here.

05:19.792 --> 05:21.041
I found her.

05:27.875 --> 05:31.542
Disinvited?
But she likes me.

05:31.542 --> 05:34.250
How could she disinvite somebody
she likes so much?

05:34.250 --> 05:38.250
Oh, I don't know.
It might be because
you started a wedding pool

05:38.250 --> 05:40.250
on how long
the marriage would last.

05:40.250 --> 05:42.542
Well,
that's not very likable.

05:42.542 --> 05:44.583
Ordinarily,
I'd find it hilarious.

05:44.583 --> 05:49.166
But I'd spent way too much time
getting in with Valerie to take
your side.

05:49.166 --> 05:51.291
- What do you mean?
- She's a friend of yours.

05:51.291 --> 05:55.166
I finally got you to introduce
me. Her family's loaded.

05:55.166 --> 05:58.375
They have a yacht. I want
friends that have a yacht.

05:58.375 --> 06:02.375
The fact that I was not
disinvited when you were
is a very positive sign.

06:02.375 --> 06:06.500
In fact, you know I probably
shouldn't even be seen
with you right now.

06:06.500 --> 06:08.208
OK, sorry, doll.

06:09.959 --> 06:12.166
[priest speaking]

06:15.125 --> 06:16.250
It's over.

06:16.250 --> 06:18.166
What?

06:35.542 --> 06:37.417
Is the wedding over already?

06:37.417 --> 06:39.917
We just ordered up
an artisanal cheese plate.

06:39.917 --> 06:42.458
No, we need to get our bags
because we are leaving.

06:42.458 --> 06:45.959
- You mean quitting.
- I'm not staying
where I'm not wanted.

06:45.959 --> 06:48.333
Well, it's not that hard.
You get used to it.

06:48.333 --> 06:50.208
[phone ringing]

06:50.208 --> 06:52.625
- Hello?
- [Howard] Guess where
I'm calling from?

06:52.625 --> 06:54.834
- The bathroom.
- The bathroom.

06:54.834 --> 06:59.834
Oh, it's like the Palace
of Versailles in there.
Heated floors.

06:59.834 --> 07:02.375
- We have to have heated floors.
- We'll see.

07:02.375 --> 07:05.458
Why don't you stay, enjoy
the room. We'll get a cab home.

07:05.458 --> 07:07.875
Are you leaving?
What did you do this time?

07:07.875 --> 07:11.917
Why is it that you immediately
assume that I've done something
wrong?

07:11.917 --> 07:14.667
I mean,
I did do something wrong.

07:14.667 --> 07:17.750
But it was the old me.
And now the new me has to leave.

07:17.750 --> 07:19.458
Oh, honey,

07:19.458 --> 07:23.208
I wish I could just put my arms
around you and make this whole
thing go away.

07:23.208 --> 07:26.208
But it might be easier
if you assumed a new identity.

07:26.208 --> 07:29.417
Yeah, get yourself a wig.
Not a cheap one. Can you do
any accents?

07:29.417 --> 07:31.458
What about
the name "Rose LaFleur?"

07:31.458 --> 07:34.834
OK, stop it!
She's not going anywhere.

07:34.834 --> 07:38.500
What are you gonna do?
Run away every time
you meet somebody you hurt?

07:38.500 --> 07:43.625
Spend five minutes with Valerie,
and she'll see you're not the
old you.

07:43.625 --> 07:46.250
- Because I'm not, huh?
- No, you're not.

07:46.250 --> 07:48.959
No. I'm not her. [grunts]

07:48.959 --> 07:52.125
Thank you, Dena. You know,
I'm going to go down there

07:52.125 --> 07:55.208
and make Valerie understand
that and make her forgive me

07:55.208 --> 07:58.333
and then you and I are
going to rock this wedding

07:58.333 --> 08:00.959
- and we are going to bring it.
- Bring it.

08:00.959 --> 08:03.500
- And we are going to rip it!
- We're going to rip it!

08:03.500 --> 08:07.208
And we're going to sock it...
That's all I got.

08:07.208 --> 08:08.583
That's all she's got.

08:09.917 --> 08:11.208
Sex?

08:11.208 --> 08:14.375
Well, we got to hurry.
The cheese is coming.

08:14.375 --> 08:17.375
- [indistinct chattering]
- [camera clicking]

08:24.250 --> 08:27.166
- Is this a bad time?
- What are you still doing here?

08:27.166 --> 08:29.208
Just wait, wait. OK?

08:29.208 --> 08:31.667
I am so sorry
about that wedding pool,

08:31.667 --> 08:35.208
but you see I don't know
why I did it because...

08:35.208 --> 08:38.542
- ...I have amnesia.
- Are you kidding me?

08:38.542 --> 08:41.583
You used that four years ago
when you crashed my Maserati.

08:41.583 --> 08:43.333
- Amnesia?
- Yeah.

08:44.333 --> 08:47.125
- And you believed that?
- Security!

08:47.125 --> 08:50.208
- No, please. Just wait.
- Hey, it's OK.
I got it. Come on.

08:50.208 --> 08:52.750
God.

08:52.750 --> 08:55.208
- What are you doing?
- I am trying to apologize.

08:55.208 --> 08:57.542
- That's what I'm doing.
- What's your angle?

08:57.542 --> 09:00.208
My angle?
Oh, I don't know,

09:00.208 --> 09:03.583
I just want to stay for dinner
because the salmon looks so
tasty.

09:03.583 --> 09:07.250
Because I've changed,
that's why. And I feel bad
about what I did.

09:07.250 --> 09:11.208
Bad? Like remorse?
Like normal people bad?

09:11.208 --> 09:14.166
Yes, Todd,
like normal people bad.

09:14.166 --> 09:18.417
I'm not giving up until she sees
how thoughtful and considerate
I can be.

09:27.041 --> 09:28.959
- Daddy!
- Wait, wait.

09:28.959 --> 09:32.208
It is possible she is sorry.
You know how relentless she is,

09:32.208 --> 09:36.250
so if you don't want her at your
honeymoon, just hear her out.

09:37.875 --> 09:39.875
One minute. Go.

09:39.875 --> 09:42.125
OK, thank you. Listen...

09:42.125 --> 09:46.000
So are you buying this
new-and-improved Sam?
You think she's changed?

09:46.000 --> 09:48.750
- Yes, I do.
- That would be nice.

09:53.166 --> 09:56.709
Remember that mean clerk
at the hospital gift shop?

09:56.709 --> 09:58.583
What was her deal?

10:00.000 --> 10:02.083
And you are.
You're very loving.

10:02.083 --> 10:05.125
- What's she doing?
- [both] Apologizing.

10:05.125 --> 10:08.208
- What's her angle?
- [both] No angle.

10:08.208 --> 10:12.875
Apologizing. Crafty.
Just when you think
she's gonna zig, she zags.

10:21.917 --> 10:24.208
That's nice.

10:24.208 --> 10:27.166
Sam, I want you back
in my wedding party.

10:27.166 --> 10:28.250
- You do?
- I do.

10:28.250 --> 10:30.917
- And you must sit at my table.
- I must?

10:30.917 --> 10:34.166
Oh, come on, girls, we have
to fix our makeup for pictures.

10:34.166 --> 10:35.208
Yeah.

10:37.250 --> 10:41.500
See? What'd I say?
I told you not to quit.

10:41.500 --> 10:44.709
- We're at table seven.
- I'm gonna sit
at Valerie's table.

10:44.709 --> 10:46.750
So I'll just catch up
with you later, OK?

10:50.208 --> 10:52.208
Yay...

10:54.208 --> 10:57.208
So all I hear is, "Snake!"

10:57.208 --> 10:59.542
And I come out
of my tent to see Sam,

10:59.542 --> 11:03.208
halfway up the trail already,
not a stitch of clothes on.

11:03.208 --> 11:04.875
Never looked back.

11:06.917 --> 11:09.250
I didn't have trouble
getting a ride home.

11:11.834 --> 11:14.709
Snake!

11:14.709 --> 11:18.250
- I'm funny.
Did you know I was funny?
- Yes!

11:18.250 --> 11:22.333
God, if we were on a yacht right
now I'd fall overboard from
laughing.

11:34.125 --> 11:37.083
Chew this time.
I'm not gonna save you twice.

11:37.083 --> 11:38.291
[grunts]

11:38.291 --> 11:41.417
I went through all that
bridesmaids crap so one time

11:41.417 --> 11:43.750
I wouldn't have to sit
at the losers' table.

11:43.750 --> 11:46.875
- Then that one has
to show up again.
- Yeah, that one.

11:46.875 --> 11:48.333
I can wait, though.

11:48.333 --> 11:52.458
It's happened before,
and she always lets me back
in eventually.

11:52.458 --> 11:54.250
How do you know
the bride?

11:54.250 --> 11:55.542
She's my sister.

12:17.208 --> 12:20.542
Hi. I was just hoping
I already sent them something.

12:20.542 --> 12:22.208
You want to dance?

12:22.208 --> 12:23.959
I don't know.
What's your angle?

12:23.959 --> 12:27.875
[♪ Ella Fitzgerald: How Long
Has This Been Going On]

12:27.875 --> 12:29.333
Come on.

12:30.250 --> 12:31.625
[snoring]

12:34.000 --> 12:37.166
Among other things, I seem
to have forgotten how to dance.

12:37.166 --> 12:39.625
No, you're a quick study.
Follow me.

12:39.625 --> 12:41.083
Oh.

12:42.625 --> 12:45.875
Hey, I'm funny.
Did you know I was funny?

12:45.875 --> 12:48.792
Yes. Yes,
and like all great comics,

12:48.792 --> 12:52.125
there's a dark evil clown
lurking behind the laughter.

12:57.208 --> 12:58.792
What?

12:58.792 --> 13:02.667
Nothing. I just kind
of like this new you.

13:02.667 --> 13:05.875
It's sort of the best
of old you without...

13:05.875 --> 13:08.667
The lying, cheating,
selfish, high-maintenance...

13:08.667 --> 13:10.542
Sam. Shh...

13:10.542 --> 13:13.375
- But pretty.
- [chuckles]

13:15.458 --> 13:17.500
Well, you better
be careful because

13:17.500 --> 13:20.166
you might just
fall for me all over again.

13:24.208 --> 13:26.000
Come on, time for toasts.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.208
Let the help get back
to work.

13:32.250 --> 13:35.208
- Wait, where's Valerie?
- She's outside or something.

13:35.208 --> 13:37.250
That hot groomsman
went to find her.

13:43.083 --> 13:46.917
To the single girl,
a vanishing breed.

13:46.917 --> 13:49.291
Another one bites the dust.

13:49.291 --> 13:51.291
[all cheer]

13:54.208 --> 13:57.834
Oh, my God, it's Paul.

13:57.834 --> 14:00.000
Oh, look at you.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.041
Paul makes you all tingly,
doesn't he?

14:03.041 --> 14:06.250
- He's Trey's friend.
- That's not an answer.

14:06.250 --> 14:09.458
- I'm getting married.
- So it's your last chance.

14:09.458 --> 14:11.542
Not necessarily.

14:11.542 --> 14:14.208
You guys are so bad.

14:14.208 --> 14:16.583
Well, it's only bad
if you get caught.

14:17.792 --> 14:20.208
- You'll never tell?
- Tell?

14:20.208 --> 14:22.667
Honey, I'm probably
not even going to remember.

14:25.667 --> 14:28.834
Did Valerie do something with
him at the bachelorette party?

14:28.834 --> 14:32.000
No. Gross.
They went back to her place.

14:43.250 --> 14:45.750
I saw you two dancing.

14:45.750 --> 14:48.709
Doesn't she seem
like a totally different person?

14:48.709 --> 14:50.583
I was just thinking
the same thing.

14:50.583 --> 14:53.000
Yeah, well, she's not.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.125
- What are you talking about?
- Old Sam's still right there,

14:56.125 --> 15:00.542
ready to dump you if, you know,
something better comes along.

15:00.542 --> 15:05.208
Ready to ditch you again
for the cool kids.

15:05.208 --> 15:08.875
She did that?
Man, she's good.

15:08.875 --> 15:11.083
Well, I can't believe
I got sucked in.

15:11.083 --> 15:12.583
I got sucked in.

15:12.583 --> 15:16.208
But you, yeah, you should not.
You're a good guy.

15:16.208 --> 15:18.458
And decent...

15:18.458 --> 15:22.083
...extremely attractive.

15:22.083 --> 15:24.333
You know, interesting...

15:25.458 --> 15:27.583
[glasses clattering]

15:34.792 --> 15:36.500
Good evening.

15:36.500 --> 15:38.750
[glass tinkling]

15:41.041 --> 15:43.750
Anyway,
when I first met this guy,

15:43.750 --> 15:46.041
he was thin and fit,

15:46.041 --> 15:47.834
with rock-hard abs.

15:47.834 --> 15:50.208
Now the only thing
that's thin is his hair,

15:50.208 --> 15:53.417
and the only thing
that's hard is his liver.

15:53.417 --> 15:55.291
He's all yours, Val.

15:55.291 --> 15:57.625
Yey!

15:57.625 --> 16:00.709
Now I want Sam
to toast us. Sam?

16:00.709 --> 16:04.500
- What? No.
- Yes. No, you have to.
It's my wedding.

16:04.500 --> 16:07.917
Sam is so funny, you guys!
Listen to her toast, everybody.

16:07.917 --> 16:09.208
Go ahead, Sam.

16:09.208 --> 16:12.208
[indistinct murmuring]

16:15.208 --> 16:17.583
Um... [clears throat]

16:18.709 --> 16:21.041
OK. Marriage.

16:22.583 --> 16:24.208
What is marriage?

16:24.208 --> 16:26.959
- [woman] That's not funny!
- Shut up, Jeanine!

16:26.959 --> 16:30.208
Well, let's just
break it down.

16:30.208 --> 16:31.375
Right?

16:31.375 --> 16:35.083
"Mar" from the Latin,
meaning "sea."

16:36.250 --> 16:39.500
And "iage,"

16:39.500 --> 16:41.250
it's the edge of the sea.

16:42.542 --> 16:44.458
It's like sailing.

16:44.458 --> 16:47.208
It's like sailing
over the edge of the sea.

16:47.208 --> 16:51.208
Into uncharted waters,
right?

16:51.208 --> 16:54.250
And you're
all sailing folk.

16:56.291 --> 16:59.000
It's a new beginning.

16:59.000 --> 17:04.083
And you know what? Who among us
doesn't need a new beginning?

17:04.083 --> 17:10.000
Or forgiveness. And if I'm
getting it, shouldn't everybody
else? Right?

17:10.000 --> 17:14.208
No matter what they've done?
Whatever mistakes or
indiscretions.

17:14.208 --> 17:18.083
Or acts of just
downright betrayal.

17:18.083 --> 17:22.208
As long as they just promise
to never do it again.

17:22.208 --> 17:25.000
Bitch! I knew you would
pull something like this!

17:25.000 --> 17:27.625
- It was Valerie's idea!
- She made me do it!

17:27.625 --> 17:29.291
- Val?
- Paul?

17:29.291 --> 17:31.125
- Daddy!
- I slept with Trey!

17:31.125 --> 17:33.083
- [Valerie] What?
- [Trey] We were drunk!

17:33.083 --> 17:35.208
[Valerie]
You're always drunk!

17:35.208 --> 17:37.792
On the plus side,
at least I won the pool.

17:42.291 --> 17:45.875
Hey. All right, first of all,
hide that knife.

17:45.875 --> 17:49.208
I'm gonna go find Dena and go
home. Those people are horrible.

17:49.208 --> 17:51.625
Well, maybe you should stay.
You fit right in.

17:51.625 --> 17:55.166
- What do you mean?
- Ask your friend, Dena.

17:55.166 --> 17:57.792
Oh, right.
She already left.

18:08.917 --> 18:11.875
- Mom?
- [Regina] I'm in here, hon.

18:11.875 --> 18:14.417
Mom, where's Dena?

18:14.417 --> 18:16.834
Please tell me she's
taking a shower with you.

18:16.834 --> 18:19.917
[Regina] No, she got her things.
She said she was taking a cab
home.

18:19.917 --> 18:23.542
But I brought her some cake
with little adulterers on it.

18:23.542 --> 18:27.041
Oh, God,
I ditched her all day.

18:27.041 --> 18:31.208
I was so obsessed with making
someone who doesn't like me
like me

18:31.208 --> 18:33.583
that I hurt
the one person who does.

18:33.583 --> 18:36.917
What is this little potty
that I'm sitting on?

18:36.917 --> 18:40.875
Oh, that's a bidet. Isn't it
cute? I'm going to get one for
our new bathroom.

18:40.875 --> 18:44.041
All right, well, I have to find
her, so can we just leave?

18:44.041 --> 18:48.166
[Howard] No. Checkout isn't
until 12. Not giving them one
second back.

18:48.166 --> 18:49.709
That's weird.

18:49.709 --> 18:52.875
[up-tempo music plays]

18:54.625 --> 18:57.583
- [leaves rustling]
- [grunting]

18:59.959 --> 19:02.583
Psst! Psst!

19:02.583 --> 19:04.125
[groans]

19:05.750 --> 19:08.166
- Sam?
- Dena, can I come in?

19:08.166 --> 19:10.834
No. Mr. Cellophane, kill.

19:10.834 --> 19:13.208
- [grunting]
- Please, just open up.

19:13.208 --> 19:16.834
- Can't. The windowsill's
painted shut.
- Oh, now that's just bull...

19:16.834 --> 19:18.834
[grunting] Whoa!

19:22.291 --> 19:24.458
- Are you OK?
- Uh-huh.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.875
I'm assuming this was a lot
easier when I was 12, huh?

19:31.333 --> 19:36.000
Look, Dena, I am so sorry
about tonight.

19:36.000 --> 19:40.583
I mean it. Look, there is nobody
who is sorrier than I am.

19:40.583 --> 19:43.542
Well, of course not. You've
had so much more practice.

19:43.542 --> 19:47.458
Look, I realize that
knowing me is risky.

19:47.458 --> 19:51.917
You never know when Old Sam's
gonna come out and do really
horrible things.

19:51.917 --> 19:55.458
You know, it's like I'm like
a werewolf. You know?

19:55.458 --> 19:59.083
All of a sudden a full moon
comes out from behind the
clouds,

19:59.083 --> 20:02.625
and next thing you know,
I'm all hairy and I'm biting
out your neck.

20:02.625 --> 20:04.834
OK, you're kind
of creeping me out.

20:04.834 --> 20:08.542
Look, I'm just trying to say
that, if you ever see the Old
Sam come out,

20:08.542 --> 20:10.875
just tell me.

20:10.875 --> 20:13.959
Or shoot me with a silver
bullet. It's your call.

20:14.875 --> 20:17.667
I'll put a cap in your ass.

20:17.667 --> 20:19.834
[laughs] Bang, bang.

20:21.125 --> 20:23.291
- Want some cocoa?
- Yes.

20:24.834 --> 20:26.291
[grunting, gasping]

20:26.291 --> 20:30.583
You know what? It's actually
kind of fun coming in this way.

20:30.583 --> 20:32.792
Not that fun since
the tree rats moved in.

20:33.834 --> 20:35.709
[moaning]

20:43.166 --> 20:46.834
[Dena] Did Todd say anything
about anything tonight?

20:46.834 --> 20:49.083
Just that I'm a big old
disappointment.

20:49.083 --> 20:51.125
Mmm.

20:51.125 --> 20:53.500
So was he a good kisser?

20:54.542 --> 20:57.750
I don't know. Why?

20:57.750 --> 20:59.250
Oh, I don't know.

21:00.875 --> 21:02.125
[Samantha chuckles]
