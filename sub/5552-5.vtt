00:02.212 --> 00:03.254
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

00:04.130 --> 00:07.801
My name is Nathaniel Barnes.
I'm your new boss.

00:07.967 --> 00:10.804
Sid Bunderslaw.
I'm the Director of Physical Operations.

00:10.970 --> 00:12.305
I've been expecting you.

00:12.681 --> 00:16.976
<i>Garrett! Pinkney! Josie! Martinez!</i>

00:17.143 --> 00:21.856
Congratulations. You are now Unit Alpha
of the G.C.P.D. Strike Force.

00:22.190 --> 00:24.442
<i>Time to take down the Penguin.</i>

00:24.609 --> 00:27.529
Mother! You'll pay for this!

00:28.196 --> 00:30.615
They die, your mother lives.

00:30.782 --> 00:34.452
I'm gonna need you to take a crack
at me also. And miss, of course.

00:34.619 --> 00:36.621
Get down!

00:37.622 --> 00:42.293
If the bad guys want to stop me running,
well then, I guess I got no choice.

00:42.460 --> 00:45.338
I will run for mayor.

00:54.222 --> 00:58.268
Thank you for the trunk, old friend.
I'll call you when I need you.

00:58.977 --> 01:00.353
I'm glad you call me a friend.

01:00.979 --> 01:04.315
Figure of speech, but do go on.

01:05.525 --> 01:06.943
I can't help feeling,

01:08.153 --> 01:10.613
wouldn't I be so much more useful
to you as a friend?

01:11.197 --> 01:12.657
As a colleague, an ally?

01:13.658 --> 01:16.369
As opposed to the tool you are at present?

01:17.620 --> 01:18.747
Good question.

01:19.998 --> 01:21.040
No.

01:23.626 --> 01:26.713
I would be a much more
effective tool for you

01:27.338 --> 01:29.716
if I wasn't so worried about my mother.

01:31.050 --> 01:33.678
If you let her come home,
I would still do your bidding.

01:34.512 --> 01:37.682
Trust me, I know who's boss now.

01:38.308 --> 01:40.185
Lord have mercy.

01:40.894 --> 01:42.812
<i>No need to rub it in.</i>

01:44.814 --> 01:48.568
Yes, sir. We all know who's boss.

01:49.027 --> 01:50.445
What do you think, Tabitha?

01:51.654 --> 01:55.366
I wasn't listening.
You know how I love the big macho type.

01:55.533 --> 01:57.535
<i>- Leave him alone.</i>
- Yeah, leave me alone.

02:00.997 --> 02:03.208
The answer is no, old friend.

02:04.542 --> 02:05.835
Off you go.

02:12.717 --> 02:14.302
<i>Stay by the phone.</i>

02:23.853 --> 02:27.190
I wish you wouldn't freak out the help.
I've got a mayoral campaign to run.

02:27.398 --> 02:29.651
<i>I need to know you're gonna
handle this part of the business.</i>

02:29.818 --> 02:30.860
I get bored.

02:31.027 --> 02:33.112
I hate it when you say that.
You have plenty to do.

02:33.279 --> 02:34.906
<i>You still have Mayor James to play with.</i>

02:35.073 --> 02:37.158
<i>He's been here nearly a month.
He's getting old fast.</i>

02:37.325 --> 02:39.244
<i>You got Barbara to hang out with.</i>

02:39.452 --> 02:41.871
<i>Yeah, she's cool, but she sleeps a lot.</i>

02:42.038 --> 02:43.081
<i>She's kind of crazy.</i>

02:43.248 --> 02:44.916
<i>That's the best part about her.</i>

02:47.669 --> 02:50.255
Galavan, what the hell is going on?

02:50.421 --> 02:52.257
Mr. Bunderslaw. Welcome.

02:52.423 --> 02:54.968
Why? What do you want with me?

02:55.885 --> 02:59.597
You are the garbage man
for Wayne Enterprises, correct?

02:59.764 --> 03:03.142
Every nasty little thing the company
has done, you know all about it.

03:03.309 --> 03:04.686
- No.
- Yes.

03:05.311 --> 03:08.773
And you are gonna
tell us everything that you know.

03:10.191 --> 03:11.651
And if I refuse?

03:12.360 --> 03:15.446
Torture. But that's for later.

03:15.655 --> 03:18.992
Right now, there is something of yours
we need to borrow.

03:19.576 --> 03:21.452
Sister, if you don't mind?

03:22.787 --> 03:24.163
Left or right?

03:24.330 --> 03:25.456
<i>Either one.</i>

04:03.161 --> 04:04.162
Hmm?

04:15.256 --> 04:17.967
Anybody who doesn't want to get shot,
raise your hand!

04:24.599 --> 04:26.601
- Get down!
<i>- Hey! Get down!</i>

04:36.611 --> 04:38.112
A damn rocket launcher?

04:38.279 --> 04:40.031
Welcome to Gotham, Captain.

04:45.119 --> 04:47.121
I can fit my yearly salary in my hands.

04:47.288 --> 04:51.084
Don't get any ideas about that cash, son.
Just bag it up.

04:51.459 --> 04:54.212
Don't worry, sir.
Ideas aren't his strong suit.

04:55.129 --> 04:58.883
Did some rough calculations, sir.
Somewhere around $2 million here.

04:59.384 --> 05:01.386
It's a strong body blow to Penguin.

05:02.595 --> 05:03.596
He'll feel it.

05:03.763 --> 05:06.683
Sir, they're asking for their pants.

05:06.849 --> 05:09.936
Read 'em their rights.
Doesn't say squat about pants.

05:10.144 --> 05:11.354
Uh, wait.

05:11.562 --> 05:13.898
Tell 'em whoever gives up
where they got the damn rocket launcher

05:14.107 --> 05:15.566
gets to wear pants.

05:15.733 --> 05:17.735
The rest can go naked, for all I care.

05:17.944 --> 05:19.862
Captain, a word?

05:23.241 --> 05:27.203
There's a place called the Merc.
Sells most of the heavy weapons in town.

05:27.912 --> 05:30.748
They haven't been hit
'cause they pay off half the City Council.

05:32.417 --> 05:33.459
The Merc, huh?

05:34.585 --> 05:38.256
City Council can suck my tailpipe.
We're gonna hit this Merc tomorrow.

05:38.423 --> 05:40.633
Pinkney, belay that order.

05:41.968 --> 05:43.553
No one get pants.

05:45.763 --> 05:46.931
We grab him up!

05:47.098 --> 05:49.767
We grab him and we hurt him
till he tells us where she is,

05:49.934 --> 05:51.060
and then we hurt him more!

05:51.269 --> 05:52.520
Okay, is that a good idea?

05:52.687 --> 05:54.272
Do you have a better one?

05:54.439 --> 05:55.648
We could get the sister.

05:55.815 --> 05:58.860
And then what? He's still out there.

05:59.569 --> 06:02.780
And does he love his sister as much
as I love my mother? I don't think so!

06:02.947 --> 06:04.449
<i>Mmm, it is a pickle.</i>

06:04.615 --> 06:05.950
Mr. Penguin, sir.

06:06.117 --> 06:09.078
The cops just hit the count house.
They took everything. Every dollar.

06:10.246 --> 06:11.247
Ooh!

06:14.751 --> 06:16.878
Did you enjoy giving me that news?

06:28.765 --> 06:29.766
Ah!

06:31.559 --> 06:34.312
Butch! I have an idea.

06:44.113 --> 06:45.156
Hey, you.

06:45.364 --> 06:46.657
Good morning.

06:46.824 --> 06:47.992
How's your day look?

06:48.159 --> 06:50.661
Strike Force is going out on another raid.

06:50.828 --> 06:53.164
"Strike Force." I hate that name.

06:53.331 --> 06:56.667
Yeah. I'm not wild about it myself,
but Barnes gets things done.

06:56.834 --> 06:58.586
He can call us what he likes.

06:58.795 --> 07:01.172
All right, so you go strike
with your force.

07:01.339 --> 07:03.466
- And what are we doing tonight?
- Sleep.

07:03.633 --> 07:05.301
Uh-uh, it's date night, mister.

07:05.468 --> 07:06.511
With who?

07:07.553 --> 07:09.680
- Morning, Ed.
- Detective. Ms. Thompkins.

07:10.431 --> 07:13.309
As you may have heard,
I've recently been seeing Ms. Kringle.

07:14.560 --> 07:15.561
Kristen.

07:15.770 --> 07:19.023
And she mentioned that it might be nice
to go out with other people along,

07:19.190 --> 07:23.111
so I thought perhaps the two of you would
enjoy joining us for dinner tonight.

07:23.277 --> 07:24.278
- We can't.
- We'd love to.

07:26.948 --> 07:29.367
Sure. Yeah. Yeah, no. Great.

07:29.534 --> 07:31.285
As a matter of fact,
I just bought some new fondue pots.

07:31.494 --> 07:32.745
Why don't we do it at my house?

07:32.912 --> 07:35.706
Excellent.
Excellent, I'll go tell Kristen.

07:38.835 --> 07:41.712
I know, I know.
But it was the decent thing to do.

07:41.879 --> 07:42.922
Fondue?

07:43.548 --> 07:45.842
Have you ever tried it? It's delicious!

07:46.384 --> 07:47.844
It's at your place.

07:48.344 --> 07:51.556
We can't leave, we're already home.
Trapped.

07:51.722 --> 07:54.016
Don't be mean. We'll make it fun.

07:57.228 --> 07:58.312
Yes, ma'am.

08:00.773 --> 08:03.067
Detective Gordon, good morning.

08:03.818 --> 08:05.987
I wonder if we could talk alone.

08:07.530 --> 08:08.656
Of course.

08:12.535 --> 08:15.329
Thank you for giving me
some of your valuable time.

08:15.830 --> 08:17.748
Oh, not a problem.

08:19.458 --> 08:23.045
That night at the gala,
I just keep going through it.

08:24.088 --> 08:25.256
Me too.

08:26.090 --> 08:27.925
I've never killed a man before.

08:29.218 --> 08:30.970
The fear, the blood.

08:32.763 --> 08:35.224
I relive that moment over and over.

08:36.934 --> 08:38.978
Do those thoughts ever go away?

08:41.189 --> 08:42.273
No.

08:42.815 --> 08:44.692
But over time, they lose their power.

08:46.611 --> 08:47.945
<i>You did the right thing.</i>

08:48.863 --> 08:51.782
I guess I did.
I'm kind of amazed at myself.

08:53.075 --> 08:55.828
You, doing the right thing,
it's what you do every day.

08:56.454 --> 08:58.497
That's why people speak so highly of you.

08:59.624 --> 09:01.667
You're a symbol
to the people of this city.

09:02.418 --> 09:05.963
Of hope. Of honor. That's why I'm here.

09:07.006 --> 09:09.967
I would be honored if you would consider

09:10.635 --> 09:12.345
endorsing me for mayor.

09:13.554 --> 09:15.097
Uh, an endorsement.

09:15.264 --> 09:19.185
I'm flattered, but I'm afraid
policemen and politics don't mix.

09:19.393 --> 09:20.811
Maybe not for a cop on the street,

09:20.978 --> 09:23.064
but you're the president
of the policemen's union.

09:23.773 --> 09:25.816
Where you lead, officers will follow.

09:25.983 --> 09:29.987
That's more power
than the kind that comes out of a gun.

09:30.321 --> 09:36.327
You seem like a good man,
but I'm afraid my answer has to be no.

09:36.494 --> 09:38.496
I don't do endorsements.

09:39.497 --> 09:41.123
I know better than to push.

09:44.710 --> 09:46.003
But think about it.

09:47.338 --> 09:49.090
We could really help each other.

09:58.474 --> 09:59.642
Hi, Penguin.

10:00.309 --> 10:01.352
What do you want?

10:01.519 --> 10:02.770
Why so glum?

10:05.273 --> 10:07.483
- I just lost a lot of money.
- Aw.

10:07.942 --> 10:09.568
Poor sad little breadhead.

10:09.777 --> 10:11.195
The money is immaterial.

10:12.029 --> 10:15.366
Someone must have betrayed me.
Someone close.

10:16.200 --> 10:17.618
You don't know that, boss.

10:18.327 --> 10:20.746
Oh, don't I? Don't I?

10:20.913 --> 10:22.665
Whoa. Chill, birdman.

10:23.874 --> 10:25.001
I got a job for you.

10:25.209 --> 10:26.627
What's that?

10:26.836 --> 10:29.505
Addresses of places
you're gonna burn to the ground.

10:30.047 --> 10:31.132
Starting tonight.

10:32.216 --> 10:33.384
Arson now?

10:34.051 --> 10:37.096
Sure, fine. Whatever.

10:38.055 --> 10:40.516
If I can find a trustworthy arsonist.

10:42.977 --> 10:44.228
Paranoid, huh?

10:46.522 --> 10:49.191
Get your head together, little man,
and get it done.

10:51.527 --> 10:54.071
And, oh, whoever starts the fires
is gonna need this.

11:31.067 --> 11:32.360
Nice place.

11:32.526 --> 11:33.903
What's up?

11:34.111 --> 11:35.738
I need you to take me
to the Pike brothers.

11:35.946 --> 11:37.698
The firebugs from the Narrows?

11:39.950 --> 11:42.495
I used to hang with their sister, Bridgit,
when I was a kid.

11:45.456 --> 11:47.958
- Why do you need me to take you?
<i>- To vouch for me.</i>

11:48.542 --> 11:52.630
The Pikes are the best arsonists in town,
but they're also Fish loyalists.

11:53.422 --> 11:56.300
The idiots think
she's comin' back some day.

11:56.467 --> 11:57.760
She might come back.

11:58.636 --> 11:59.720
I was there, darlin'.

11:59.887 --> 12:01.013
She might.

12:01.180 --> 12:02.348
Whatever.

12:02.973 --> 12:05.142
The Pikes hate me and Penguin
for obvious reasons,

12:05.309 --> 12:08.270
but everyone knows Fish loved you.

12:08.479 --> 12:09.814
They do?

12:09.980 --> 12:11.565
Your face will open doors, babe.

12:13.734 --> 12:14.735
600.

12:14.902 --> 12:16.028
350.

12:18.447 --> 12:19.490
Fine.

12:24.370 --> 12:25.996
Just let me do the talking.

12:26.580 --> 12:28.582
You just smile
and make like we're friends.

12:29.333 --> 12:30.501
Friends?

12:31.710 --> 12:33.129
That's 100 extra.

12:35.506 --> 12:36.799
Chiseler.

12:37.591 --> 12:39.510
So everybody knows she loved me?

12:39.677 --> 12:41.053
That's what they say.

12:42.513 --> 12:45.850
She loved me too, once. And I loved her.

12:46.016 --> 12:47.184
Then you shot her.

12:49.603 --> 12:51.063
It was complicated.

12:51.230 --> 12:53.149
Got that right.

12:55.067 --> 12:56.152
<i>Hi, Bridgit.</i>

12:59.196 --> 13:03.075
Hey, Selina. It's been a while.

13:04.535 --> 13:08.038
Me and my pet gorilla are here
on business. Your brothers home?

13:09.915 --> 13:10.916
Yeah.

13:19.758 --> 13:21.010
Hey, boys.

13:21.218 --> 13:22.928
What are you doing with this rat, Selina?

13:23.137 --> 13:25.723
He's okay. I vouch for him.

13:25.973 --> 13:28.726
What do you mean "okay"?
The bastard shot Fish.

13:28.893 --> 13:30.352
It was complicated.

13:31.228 --> 13:33.022
He loves her, just like you do.

13:33.230 --> 13:35.774
- And if she ever comes back--
- When she comes back.

13:35.941 --> 13:39.236
When she does,
he will be right by her side.

13:39.904 --> 13:42.698
If she comes back? Sure. But she--

13:42.907 --> 13:45.534
But for right now,
he got a nice job for you guys.

13:45.701 --> 13:47.369
Business is business, right?

13:48.037 --> 13:49.955
<i>Hey, bygones, huh?</i>

13:50.581 --> 13:52.708
We need the best,
and you guys are the best.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.960
<i>Oh... Easy.</i>

14:05.179 --> 14:06.180
<i>That's a lot of work.</i>

14:06.347 --> 14:08.516
<i>It's a lot of pay. You up for it?</i>

14:10.100 --> 14:11.352
For sure.

14:11.560 --> 14:14.605
We'll need more gear.
I'll hit the Merc and stock up.

14:14.772 --> 14:16.815
<i>We've got enough gear
to burn down Gotham twice.</i>

14:17.107 --> 14:18.734
There's always room for more napalm.

14:28.619 --> 14:29.620
<i>Thanks.</i>

14:34.792 --> 14:36.085
Hey, sis.

14:36.835 --> 14:38.504
<i>What are you? A slob?</i>

14:38.671 --> 14:41.549
We have company.
What do we do when we have company?

14:41.757 --> 14:42.800
We get them a glass.

14:42.967 --> 14:45.177
Ding, ding, ding. Go and do it.

14:53.060 --> 14:54.186
Thank you, Bridgit.

15:07.116 --> 15:08.325
You're gonna need this.

15:25.009 --> 15:26.010
Hey.

15:26.343 --> 15:27.344
Hey.

15:30.389 --> 15:31.599
Looks like rain.

15:33.517 --> 15:35.227
Yeah, it does.

15:36.937 --> 15:38.272
<i>I don't mind it.</i>

15:39.106 --> 15:40.733
<i>Cleans the streets, anyhow.</i>

15:41.483 --> 15:42.693
That's true.

15:47.031 --> 15:48.449
Anyway, um,

15:50.826 --> 15:52.536
take care of yourself, Bridgit.

15:54.455 --> 15:55.789
<i>Be strong.</i>

16:11.805 --> 16:13.098
<i>Yeah, can we get a price check</i>

16:13.307 --> 16:15.392
<i>on brass knuckles in toxic green?</i>

16:21.398 --> 16:22.983
300 gets it done.

16:25.861 --> 16:28.530
Add 10% surcharge for soiled bills.

16:30.866 --> 16:32.242
Thank you kindly.

16:32.409 --> 16:35.954
<i>Try our whipping ware,
on sale now in aisle seven.</i>

16:39.083 --> 16:42.920
<i>Welcome to Merc, your one-stop shop
for machetes, night-vision goggles</i>

16:43.087 --> 16:45.422
<i>and all of your personal defense needs.</i>

16:51.011 --> 16:52.012
Huh.

16:53.180 --> 16:54.431
Robbery.

16:59.478 --> 17:00.604
<i>G.C.P.D.!</i>

17:00.771 --> 17:02.940
Everybody on the ground! This is a raid!

17:03.982 --> 17:05.067
Runner!

17:06.276 --> 17:07.277
I got him!

17:18.414 --> 17:19.415
<i>Stop!</i>

17:19.623 --> 17:20.708
Stop right now!

17:42.813 --> 17:44.481
What the hell are you packing?

17:50.779 --> 17:53.949
When cheese melts,
the protein matrix relaxes

17:54.116 --> 17:56.076
and the fats flow more like liquid.

17:56.243 --> 17:59.830
It creates this low-friction mouth-feel,
which is why melted cheese is so--

17:59.997 --> 18:00.998
Ed.

18:02.166 --> 18:03.876
Well, it's delicious.

18:04.126 --> 18:05.669
Mmm-hmm, yes, it is.

18:05.878 --> 18:07.796
Oh, ah.

18:08.046 --> 18:09.173
Oh, no!

18:11.383 --> 18:14.720
Oh, Lee, we shouldn't be eating
without Jim here. I'm so sorry.

18:14.887 --> 18:16.805
No, no, no. Please eat, it's fine.

18:17.556 --> 18:19.808
Oh, there he is. Hello there.

18:19.975 --> 18:21.226
Hey, Jim. Nice to see you.

18:21.393 --> 18:22.644
Sorry I'm late.

18:26.273 --> 18:28.734
Really sorry. Long story.

18:29.818 --> 18:31.779
I hope it hasn't been going too bad.

18:31.987 --> 18:33.238
You know what? It's the weirdest thing,

18:33.447 --> 18:36.950
but Nygma's actually maintaining
this strange sort of cool.

18:37.117 --> 18:38.118
No.

18:38.327 --> 18:39.953
Seriously.

18:40.871 --> 18:42.706
Ah...

18:43.499 --> 18:45.000
There's a lid for every pot.

18:46.251 --> 18:50.380
Pardon me. Since Detective Gordon is here,
I'd like to propose a toast.

18:50.631 --> 18:52.090
<i>Mmm.</i>

18:54.676 --> 18:57.262
The less you have, the more they're worth.

18:58.222 --> 18:59.389
To friends.

19:00.057 --> 19:01.642
Hear, hear.

19:04.561 --> 19:06.063
I can't believe he's dead.

19:06.230 --> 19:08.565
Biggest job of our lives,
and this happens.

19:08.732 --> 19:09.900
<i>So what do we do?</i>

19:10.400 --> 19:11.902
For sure, we do the job.

19:12.069 --> 19:15.405
How? We're screwed.
Who's our entry man now?

19:15.572 --> 19:17.407
Crawling through air vents,
climbing fire escapes.

19:17.574 --> 19:19.493
We need a little skinny guy.

19:22.120 --> 19:23.247
You think?

19:25.249 --> 19:27.793
Yo, Bridgy. You just got a promotion.

19:28.001 --> 19:29.378
- No.
- Yes.

19:29.545 --> 19:31.380
Please, you know I don't like fire.

19:31.547 --> 19:34.091
You don't like fire?
Fire is our bread and butter.

19:34.258 --> 19:35.592
It's our family business.

19:35.759 --> 19:38.095
You don't wanna let down your family,
do you?

19:38.262 --> 19:39.429
You're not my family.

19:40.180 --> 19:43.934
What's that? We're not your family?
You got anybody else?

19:44.101 --> 19:46.770
- My mother--
- Your mother was a ho, and she's dead.

19:46.937 --> 19:49.606
Who feeds you?
Who puts a roof above your head, huh?

19:49.815 --> 19:51.942
We do. That's family.

19:52.442 --> 19:53.485
I won't do it.

19:53.735 --> 19:54.736
Oh.

19:55.445 --> 19:57.072
Fine, be like that.

19:57.239 --> 20:00.117
But if you're not family, well,
that changes things around here, though.

20:00.325 --> 20:03.245
See, I'm a decent guy.
I would never put family on the street.

20:03.453 --> 20:05.122
But if you're not family,

20:05.789 --> 20:08.792
hell, why not make a buck?

20:09.001 --> 20:11.670
Yo, that's a kick-ass idea.

20:12.170 --> 20:13.589
So what are you gonna do?

20:14.631 --> 20:19.636
Do you wanna be turned out,
or do you wanna be family? Which?

20:21.597 --> 20:22.723
Family.

20:26.685 --> 20:28.979
He wanted me to endorse him for mayor.

20:29.646 --> 20:30.647
Wow.

20:30.814 --> 20:32.482
What did you say?

20:32.649 --> 20:33.817
I said no.

20:35.277 --> 20:36.445
You don't like him?

20:36.904 --> 20:40.908
I do, actually,
but I know better than to let that matter.

20:41.742 --> 20:44.161
Endorsing politicians, that's not me.

20:44.328 --> 20:46.163
Still, he asked you.
That's very flattering.

20:46.330 --> 20:48.415
You're a respected figure in this town.

20:51.126 --> 20:54.504
The way people look at you,
see you differently.

20:54.671 --> 20:56.173
You treat it like it's a burden.

20:56.757 --> 20:59.676
It could be a source of pride,
or happiness even, if you let it.

21:01.511 --> 21:03.847
Thank you, Doctor. Same time next week?

21:04.097 --> 21:05.140
<i>Oh...</i>

21:05.474 --> 21:08.560
Don't tempt me.
I could psychoanalyze the heck out of you,

21:09.144 --> 21:10.646
but I'm gonna resist the urge.

21:13.357 --> 21:14.566
Gee, thanks.

21:19.655 --> 21:21.949
Be strong, Bridgit.

21:24.451 --> 21:26.912
Okay. It's on.

21:27.120 --> 21:30.415
Now, you're gonna want to cut yourself
about a foot and a half of fuse.

21:35.921 --> 21:37.047
Okay.

21:37.214 --> 21:39.841
Push the wick into the plastic explosive.

21:42.970 --> 21:44.221
Okay.

21:44.388 --> 21:45.764
Now, get out the flame.

21:49.309 --> 21:52.312
You got about a minute and a half
to get out of there once that fuse is lit.

21:52.938 --> 21:54.147
Spark it up.

21:57.526 --> 21:59.194
- It's lit.
<i>- Okay, great.</i>

21:59.361 --> 22:01.154
<i>Sorry, there's one more thing to do.</i>

22:01.321 --> 22:03.156
- But it's lit!
- Well, you better haul ass.

22:03.323 --> 22:04.950
<i>Do you see a safe on your right?</i>

22:05.409 --> 22:06.451
Yeah.

22:06.618 --> 22:08.912
<i>- Get to it.</i>
- Okay.

22:10.622 --> 22:11.748
Okay.

22:11.915 --> 22:14.584
Okay, now grab the box at the bottom
of the bag and open it up.

22:17.504 --> 22:18.505
Oh...

22:20.549 --> 22:22.134
Oh, my God!

22:22.551 --> 22:26.722
Grody, right? Okay, put it to the sensor
next to the door.

22:28.974 --> 22:30.767
<i>Welcome, Mr. Bunderslaw.</i>

22:35.272 --> 22:37.816
Okay, it's open. Now what?

22:38.358 --> 22:40.235
Joe?

22:40.902 --> 22:42.446
Joe, where are you?

22:43.822 --> 22:46.116
- Joe, what's wrong?
- I'm just messing with you.

22:46.283 --> 22:48.869
<i>Okay, so there should be
an old knife there. Grab it.</i>

22:53.749 --> 22:55.208
Okay, I got it.

22:55.375 --> 22:58.795
Okay. Now scram.

23:16.313 --> 23:17.481
<i>Atta girl.</i>

23:17.731 --> 23:19.816
You did good, sis.
Get in the van, chop-chop.

23:19.983 --> 23:21.276
I burned my leg.

23:21.443 --> 23:23.612
You play with fire, you get burned,
all that.

23:23.779 --> 23:27.324
We got four more of these to do
tonight, so get in the damn van.

23:44.007 --> 23:46.760
Five locations. All burned to the ground.

23:47.969 --> 23:50.889
- Yeah, Garrett?
- Excuse me, sir. Lab called in.

23:51.056 --> 23:54.101
Said the fires were started with thermite
and high-end accelerants.

23:54.309 --> 23:57.312
So, we're looking for professional
arsonists. Thanks.

23:57.896 --> 24:00.148
And Garrett, nice work yesterday.

24:00.357 --> 24:01.691
Thank you, sir.

24:03.026 --> 24:07.948
Strange. Why would a pro do five jobs
in one night? What's the rush?

24:08.156 --> 24:09.491
And what if they're not done?

24:10.826 --> 24:15.038
Find a pattern to these fires
before they burn down the whole city.

25:13.305 --> 25:15.098
What are you doing?

25:15.265 --> 25:19.936
Hi! Making a suit,
so I won't get burned again.

25:20.145 --> 25:21.897
Why would you get burned again?

25:28.945 --> 25:30.947
So they're making you start the fires?

25:31.740 --> 25:33.074
I guess.

25:34.117 --> 25:36.077
Sit down. You want a soda or something?

25:36.286 --> 25:38.997
No, I can't.
I'm supposed to take that to Penguin.

25:39.289 --> 25:41.499
Oh. Okay.

25:42.626 --> 25:44.419
You know you're gonna
get yourself killed.

25:44.586 --> 25:45.795
I'll be careful.

25:45.962 --> 25:48.882
Well, careful ain't enough.
Look what happened already.

25:49.507 --> 25:53.762
It was exciting, Selina.
I actually kind of enjoyed it.

25:56.723 --> 25:59.100
Yep. You're gonna be bacon.

26:01.061 --> 26:03.438
My brothers said I did a good job!

26:04.314 --> 26:05.649
It's the family business.

26:05.815 --> 26:07.192
They're not your family.

26:07.901 --> 26:12.697
Your mom used to
bang their old man is all.

26:12.906 --> 26:17.160
You don't need them. You don't need
anybody. Look at me, I'm free.

26:20.372 --> 26:24.334
I remember when I was little
and you showed up at the Narrows.

26:25.001 --> 26:27.963
You looked for your mom every day.

26:28.546 --> 26:30.173
Snot all down your face from crying.

26:30.382 --> 26:32.300
So don't act like you don't want a family.

26:32.467 --> 26:33.760
Don't talk about my mom.

26:33.927 --> 26:37.847
Who cares if you're free?
What good's freedom if you're alone?

26:38.014 --> 26:40.433
What good's family if you're a slave?

26:42.227 --> 26:43.228
<i>Huh?</i>

26:49.651 --> 26:50.944
Whatever.

26:51.945 --> 26:54.155
I don't even know why you think I care.

27:07.836 --> 27:11.298
It doesn't make any sense.
This is the Wayne family crest.

27:11.840 --> 27:13.341
So what?

27:13.508 --> 27:16.761
Why does Galavan want an antique knife
that belonged to the Waynes?

27:18.430 --> 27:19.639
There's something here.

27:20.307 --> 27:23.893
Something to understanding Galavan,
to beating him.

27:24.519 --> 27:27.480
Well, if you wanna know about
old-time Gotham, talk to Edwige.

27:28.857 --> 27:30.066
Edwige?

27:30.233 --> 27:32.610
Yeah. She runs the antique shop
in my old neighborhood.

27:33.820 --> 27:36.614
Trust me. She knows things.

27:44.706 --> 27:46.166
<i>You can pick it up if you like.</i>

27:46.333 --> 27:51.212
That's okay. Sorry. I can't help you.

27:51.421 --> 27:55.592
Edwige, I can see
that you know this knife.

27:56.760 --> 27:59.804
<i>You're scared of this knife. Why?</i>

28:00.597 --> 28:03.099
- Why are you lying to me?
- I'm not.

28:03.266 --> 28:07.562
Madam, if there's one thing I know,
it's a liar.

28:08.772 --> 28:13.068
Now tell me about this knife,
or I will use it.

28:25.372 --> 28:29.125
This knife has a cursed history.

28:30.960 --> 28:34.964
Almost 200 years ago,
it was used in a terrible crime.

28:36.424 --> 28:41.888
Back then, five families
ruled Gotham high society.

28:42.138 --> 28:46.643
<i>The Elliots, the Kanes,
the Crownes, the Dumas</i>

28:47.143 --> 28:51.773
and the most powerful of them all,
the Waynes.

28:51.981 --> 28:56.528
<i>They called Celestine Wayne
"the crown jewel of Gotham."</i>

28:57.278 --> 28:58.863
<i>A real beauty.</i>

28:59.489 --> 29:04.411
<i>She was promised to the eldest son
of the Elliot family,</i>

29:04.619 --> 29:07.205
but there was another who coveted her.

29:07.872 --> 29:09.374
<i>Caleb Dumas.</i>

29:10.041 --> 29:11.418
<i>One night,</i>

29:13.294 --> 29:16.172
<i>during an Easter party at the Wayne Manor,</i>

29:16.923 --> 29:19.759
<i>Celestine and Caleb went missing.</i>

29:21.511 --> 29:25.890
Wayne men found them together
in an illicit embrace.

29:26.141 --> 29:28.309
- No!
- No!

29:28.518 --> 29:31.104
- We're in love!
<i>- Caleb insisted that they were in love.</i>

29:31.938 --> 29:35.692
And Celestine swore on her mother's grave

29:35.859 --> 29:38.987
that Caleb had forced himself on her.

29:40.238 --> 29:41.239
Listen!

29:41.448 --> 29:45.076
<i>Justice, if that's what it was, was swift.</i>

29:45.243 --> 29:48.997
<i>Celestine's brother Jonathan Wayne
delivered the punishment.</i>

29:49.205 --> 29:50.790
No!

29:51.541 --> 29:55.295
The Waynes, they were mad with rage.

29:55.503 --> 29:59.466
<i>They seized the Dumas holdings
and banished them socially.</i>

29:59.674 --> 30:01.217
<i>Destroyed them.</i>

30:01.426 --> 30:05.889
Caleb Dumas went into exile overseas,

30:06.848 --> 30:12.729
<i>to a penitential religious sect
founded by his family's patron saint.</i>

30:13.813 --> 30:16.816
Celestine died an old maid.

30:17.734 --> 30:23.239
The Waynes forbade the press
from even mentioning the Dumas.

30:24.532 --> 30:28.453
<i>They renamed streets and buildings.</i>

30:29.746 --> 30:34.709
<i>The remnants of the Dumas family
were forced to change their name.</i>

30:35.752 --> 30:41.716
The Waynes wiped the Dumas
out of our city's history.

30:42.133 --> 30:44.469
Those remnants of the Dumas family,

30:45.929 --> 30:48.139
to what did they change their name?

30:49.098 --> 30:50.892
Aren't you quick?

30:53.436 --> 30:54.771
Galavan.

30:55.855 --> 30:58.816
<i>They changed their name to Galavan,</i>

31:00.276 --> 31:02.946
<i>just like that fella running for mayor.</i>

31:04.113 --> 31:06.783
And that's why I'm scared of this knife.

31:09.327 --> 31:12.038
You're in deep waters, Mr. Penguin.

31:14.916 --> 31:16.334
Thank you, Edwige.

31:17.418 --> 31:19.379
That is where penguins thrive.

31:32.475 --> 31:35.353
You hear anything about any fires,
you come see me.

31:35.562 --> 31:38.106
Earn yourself a get-out-of-jail-free card,
all right?

31:39.691 --> 31:41.651
You got a look on your face.

31:41.818 --> 31:43.736
It's well-hidden behind a bunch
of corporate aliases,

31:43.903 --> 31:46.322
but all the buildings that burned down
last night?

31:46.489 --> 31:49.742
They have one landlord. Wayne Enterprises.

31:49.909 --> 31:50.910
Uh-huh.

31:51.661 --> 31:53.663
The arsonists moved east to west.

31:53.830 --> 31:57.250
If they come out tonight and stick
to pattern, there's one obvious target.

31:57.458 --> 32:00.378
An old building also owned
by Wayne Enterprises,

32:00.545 --> 32:03.006
- Gotham City Book Depository.
- Yay!

32:03.298 --> 32:05.174
Stakeout. I'll buy the donuts.

32:05.341 --> 32:08.511
Just no chili dogs this time, huh?
I'll let Barnes know the plan.

32:19.022 --> 32:20.648
I sent the knife to Galavan.

32:23.192 --> 32:24.694
Your favorite, isn't it?

32:27.614 --> 32:29.866
"Crosswhite 20-year."

32:30.158 --> 32:31.868
That's the stuff, all right.

32:32.535 --> 32:33.870
Have a taste.

32:35.121 --> 32:37.665
Nah, I'm good right now. Thanks.

32:38.416 --> 32:40.084
Have a drink, Butch.

32:52.263 --> 32:54.474
Your conditioning is still
working nicely, hmm?

32:55.725 --> 32:57.393
You can't refuse me.

32:58.519 --> 33:01.147
You're the only man I can truly
trust right now.

33:02.565 --> 33:04.651
You're starting to sound
a little paranoid, boss.

33:07.403 --> 33:10.657
Am I? Am I going mad?

33:11.115 --> 33:14.577
Mmm. How could I not when that fiend
has my mother in his clutches?

33:15.411 --> 33:17.080
Have another drink, Butch.

33:22.960 --> 33:24.754
Maybe I am going mad.

33:25.755 --> 33:29.175
Or maybe I've found Galavan's weakness.

33:30.093 --> 33:31.427
You did?

33:32.261 --> 33:36.516
The knife, Butch.
The knife that maimed his ancestor.

33:37.892 --> 33:40.228
This is a blood feud for Galavan.

33:40.895 --> 33:43.147
He wants revenge against the Waynes.

33:43.940 --> 33:48.611
He's acting out of emotion,
and that can be manipulated.

33:49.445 --> 33:50.947
Have another drink.

33:52.699 --> 33:54.617
You are going to go to Galavan.

33:55.201 --> 33:57.203
You're going to tell him I went nuts

33:57.412 --> 34:00.331
and that I accused you of setting up
the count shop raid.

34:01.290 --> 34:04.293
You are in fear for your life
and you need a job. Got that?

34:04.585 --> 34:06.462
Yes, boss.

34:07.213 --> 34:10.717
Once you're inside his organization,
you will find my mother and rescue her.

34:12.677 --> 34:13.720
Yes, boss.

34:15.847 --> 34:17.390
But Galavan's a smart guy,

34:18.141 --> 34:19.767
and that's a basic play.

34:20.435 --> 34:22.228
No way is he gonna buy I turned traitor.

34:22.395 --> 34:23.604
No.

34:24.230 --> 34:28.359
But he will buy
that I think you turned traitor.

34:29.152 --> 34:32.113
He'll buy it, if we sell it right.

34:33.114 --> 34:34.282
Drink up.

34:41.122 --> 34:42.331
How do we sell it?

34:42.498 --> 34:47.837
I already sold him my paranoia,
but you're the closer.

34:48.045 --> 34:49.756
How do we sell you?

34:50.381 --> 34:53.760
How do we make him trust and feel for you?

34:55.136 --> 34:56.679
I wasn't sure.

34:57.513 --> 35:01.684
But then Celestine and Caleb told me how.

35:03.186 --> 35:04.270
How?

35:14.071 --> 35:18.743
It's the onions that bring it together.
Sweetness and the acid. Am I right?

35:18.951 --> 35:20.661
- I hate stakeouts.
- Mmm.

35:20.828 --> 35:25.625
Half of good police work is the ability
to sit on one's ass when it's called for.

35:25.833 --> 35:28.211
If that were true, you'd be commissioner.

35:28.419 --> 35:30.296
Hardy-har-har!

35:31.172 --> 35:32.507
Heads up.

35:51.734 --> 35:54.153
All units, stand by.
We may have something.

35:54.362 --> 35:55.404
<i>Roger.</i>

36:07.041 --> 36:09.293
So it's all old books in there,
so this one's easy.

36:09.460 --> 36:11.921
Just spread the napalm around,
spark that thing up and go to town.

36:12.088 --> 36:13.798
- Zero sweat.
- This thing scares me.

36:13.965 --> 36:16.092
Yeah, it's a flamethrower.
It's meant to be scary.

36:16.259 --> 36:19.804
Get suited up, and get this done.
We got three more spots to hit.

36:33.901 --> 36:35.778
All units, converge on our location now.

36:35.945 --> 36:37.113
<i>Moving in.</i>

36:39.740 --> 36:40.825
G.C.P.D.!

36:41.033 --> 36:43.828
Run! Go! Go! Go!

36:44.036 --> 36:45.496
Gray van leaving the alley.

36:47.039 --> 36:50.376
Get back! Please! Get back!

36:50.877 --> 36:53.921
Drop it! Put down the weapon!

37:06.726 --> 37:07.977
Drop the weapon!

37:08.144 --> 37:09.729
- I've got her! Drop it!
- No!

37:09.937 --> 37:11.397
<i>- Garrett, no!</i>
- Let me go!

37:11.856 --> 37:13.107
Drop it!

37:13.316 --> 37:15.651
No! Let go of me!

37:22.408 --> 37:23.784
Garrett!

37:23.951 --> 37:25.328
I got him, I got him.

37:31.167 --> 37:33.419
I need an ambulance! Officer down!

37:34.879 --> 37:36.547
Bridgit! Bridgit!

37:37.256 --> 37:38.549
Come on, hurry.

37:39.800 --> 37:41.344
Quick, follow me.

37:41.510 --> 37:43.429
- Where are we going?
- Home.

37:54.774 --> 37:57.109
Thanks. Any news?

37:57.276 --> 38:00.529
Not yet. He's a tough kid.
I bet you he makes it.

38:01.113 --> 38:04.325
Your buddy's here.
Can't stop pressing the flesh.

38:04.492 --> 38:06.035
<i>Real publicity hound.</i>

38:06.452 --> 38:08.079
There's no cameras here.

38:08.245 --> 38:09.664
<i>Your attention please.</i>

38:16.545 --> 38:17.546
Captain?

38:22.385 --> 38:26.097
Luke Garrett passed away at 5:23 a.m.

38:26.263 --> 38:27.306
Damn it.

38:27.473 --> 38:31.227
It ain't right. Burned to death
in an alley by some weirdo.

38:31.435 --> 38:33.270
He was gonna be a great cop.

38:33.437 --> 38:36.899
He was a great cop, and we will mourn him.

38:37.400 --> 38:38.567
<i>But not now.</i>

38:39.360 --> 38:43.489
There's a cop killer on the loose.
I cannot abide that.

38:43.656 --> 38:45.908
We will find the person
who killed our brother,

38:46.075 --> 38:50.746
and we will put a stop to them,
using every legal method at our disposal.

38:54.792 --> 38:56.002
Excuse me.

39:03.843 --> 39:06.095
Your fellow officer is dead.
I can see it in your face.

39:06.262 --> 39:07.555
He is.

39:07.763 --> 39:08.931
I'm sorry to hear it.

39:09.765 --> 39:12.101
The bad guys in this town are changing.

39:12.309 --> 39:16.397
They're not playing by the old rules,
or any rules.

39:17.773 --> 39:23.279
We need every method at our disposal,
and I'm not just talking about more guns.

39:23.446 --> 39:27.074
You need to go where you need to go,
press who you need to press

39:27.283 --> 39:29.493
and have the city back your play.

39:30.286 --> 39:31.454
Correct.

39:33.247 --> 39:35.291
I don't know how bad it's gonna get,

39:36.167 --> 39:40.671
but if you can give me your word
that we won't have to face it alone,

39:42.381 --> 39:44.300
you'll have my endorsement.

39:45.092 --> 39:48.554
I promise you,
you'll have whatever you need.

40:45.152 --> 40:46.779
Father Creel.

40:48.656 --> 40:49.865
Theo.

40:51.534 --> 40:53.035
It's been a long time.

40:58.124 --> 40:59.959
You look well.

41:00.584 --> 41:01.794
As do you.

41:03.546 --> 41:05.965
You've surrounded yourself with luxury.

41:06.173 --> 41:10.302
I have to play the part, Father,
and as you'll see,

41:15.641 --> 41:17.268
it's paying off.

41:25.067 --> 41:27.069
Still sharp after all these years.

41:28.320 --> 41:29.655
Do you have the Wayne boy?

41:30.197 --> 41:34.827
Not yet. There are some practical matters
that have to be resolved first.

41:35.035 --> 41:40.082
A few pieces to arrange on the board
before the checkmate. But soon.

41:40.791 --> 41:44.503
After almost 200 years, we can be patient.

41:45.588 --> 41:47.673
The day of redemption is at hand.

41:48.424 --> 41:51.343
<i>Our brothers are crossing the ocean
even now.</i>

41:51.927 --> 41:55.306
<i>Warriors like this city has never known.</i>

41:55.514 --> 41:58.767
Gotham will be redeemed in blood.

42:00.603 --> 42:03.606
And Bruce Wayne will die.

42:47.650 --> 42:48.692
