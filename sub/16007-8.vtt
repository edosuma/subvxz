Confirmation of what we already
know - male, mixed ethnicity.

00:07.546 --> 00:09.545
Very hard without
a full face morphology

00:09.546 --> 00:11.782
to see what this bloke
would look like.

00:11.807 --> 00:15.782
And we have something else in
common - I've also lost a loved one.

00:15.783 --> 00:17.264
I'm sorry.

00:17.290 --> 00:20.938
But if he had been murdered,
I don't know how you survive that.

00:20.939 --> 00:24.057
Don't think I could've
got through it without my kids.

00:24.082 --> 00:27.520
After this... I've decided
not to return to the DPP.

00:27.546 --> 00:31.098
It's a tough job, Richard.
The isolated nature of the bar is...

00:31.124 --> 00:33.242
I wasn't actually asking for advice.

00:33.268 --> 00:36.545
This visionary development
has only been made possible

00:36.546 --> 00:38.545
by your state government

00:38.546 --> 00:42.545
agreeing to sell the Crown land
on which this centre will be built

00:42.546 --> 00:44.546
for the nominal sum of $1.

my sister who's no longer with us.

Ms King, as the de facto partner
of the deceased

00:55.546 --> 00:59.545
at the time of her death,
has title to that embryo.

00:59.546 --> 01:04.546
The appeal is dismissed and the
decision of the trial judge stands.

01:06.546 --> 01:10.545
According to this, Heather was
in here at 2:16am for seven minutes.

01:10.546 --> 01:12.605
At quarter past two in the morning?

01:12.630 --> 01:14.545
Where were you, uh, last night?

01:14.546 --> 01:18.545
If I'm under official investigation,
I'll give you his name.

01:18.546 --> 01:20.545
Until then,
a bit of trust would be nice.

01:20.546 --> 01:22.545
We know these weapons
are being imported

01:22.546 --> 01:23.545
by someone Brett was working for.

01:23.546 --> 01:26.545
And whoever it is
has so far made no attempt

01:26.546 --> 01:28.545
to pick up a container that'd give
them a multimillion-dollar payday.

01:28.546 --> 01:30.545
Janet, I've got a lot of options
on the table

01:30.546 --> 01:33.546

01:39.546 --> 01:42.047
means we are unable to fulfil
our wider brief.

01:42.048 --> 01:43.545
While I refuse to resign,

01:43.546 --> 01:46.545
I have no choice
but to suspend this Royal Commission

This inquiry into Janet,

10:43.801 --> 10:45.919
When we were set up
20-odd years ago,

10:45.944 --> 10:48.801
this state was rife with corruption.

criminals paid anyone
who stuck out their hand.

10:55.303 --> 10:58.800
'New South Wales for sale' -
that's what it was called.

10:58.801 --> 10:59.860
We stamped it out.

10:59.885 --> 11:03.635
'To investigate and prevent
corruption among public officials' -

11:03.636 --> 11:05.931
that's your charter.
Yeah, that's right.

11:05.956 --> 11:09.800

Except it doesn't.

11:12.801 --> 11:15.134
You might think it does,
but under the terms of the Act,

11:15.135 --> 11:16.901
the SCC explores corruption by

11:16.926 --> 11:19.468
and collusion
between public officials.

11:19.469 --> 11:20.800
And that text message

11:20.801 --> 11:23.135
didn't cause any public officials
to act corruptly.

11:23.136 --> 11:25.135
There was no raid on the house.

11:25.136 --> 11:26.800
No police were paid
to look the other way.

11:26.801 --> 11:28.800
No judge was bribed to acquit.

11:28.801 --> 11:30.968
Oh, for God's sake,
even the bloke at the pub could see

11:30.969 --> 11:33.969
that she attempted
to pervert the course of justice.

11:33.970 --> 11:37.471
And investigating an individual
perverting the course of justice

11:37.472 --> 11:39.800
is not a power the SCC actually has.

11:39.801 --> 11:41.800

11:41.801 --> 11:44.154

11:46.801 --> 11:49.800
the validity of these hearings
in the High Court,

11:49.801 --> 11:52.800
you'd have to refer
the case to... well, me.

12:54.801 --> 12:56.800
Owen.
OWEN: Yeah, Boccaro's on the move.

12:56.801 --> 12:58.860
I've been following him
across town.

12:58.885 --> 13:00.800
Is Heather still with him?

13:00.801 --> 13:02.801
No, he's on his own.

13:04.801 --> 13:07.800
Oh... hang on.
What?

13:07.801 --> 13:09.800
He's stopping.

13:09.801 --> 13:10.801
Where?

13:10.802 --> 13:13.801
No, it's just a car park.
I'm going to follow him.

13:24.801 --> 13:26.469
Janet?

13:27.801 --> 13:31.801
He's waiting. Must be
a meeting of some kind, I think.

13:33.801 --> 13:36.303
Someone's here.
Who is it?

13:37.801 --> 13:39.449
Boccaro's getting something.

13:44.801 --> 13:47.800
It's the money.
I think it's the money.

13:47.801 --> 13:49.800
I've got to film this.
Owen...

13:49.801 --> 13:51.801
(PHONE BEEPS)

13:53.636 --> 13:54.801
(PHONE DINGS)

14:01.969 --> 14:03.801
Fuck me.

14:09.801 --> 14:12.800
Oh, hey, welcome back.
Thanks.

14:12.801 --> 14:14.800
I saw on the news
you beat some charges.

14:14.801 --> 14:17.800
Ah, more or less. Listen, um,
remind me to fix up my account.

14:17.801 --> 14:19.468
No, there's no rush.

14:19.469 --> 14:21.800
I may be finished by the end
of the week. Don't let me forget.

14:21.801 --> 14:23.800
How it must be to be you -

14:23.801 --> 14:25.800
I mean, you're running a Royal
Commission, amazing two children

14:25.801 --> 14:28.154
and you still look
completely immaculate.

14:28.179 --> 14:30.014
Oh, I don't know about that.

14:31.802 --> 14:33.800
I enjoyed our drink.

14:33.801 --> 14:35.800
Sorry?

14:35.801 --> 14:38.919
What you said, I feel light,
like things are in focus.

14:38.944 --> 14:41.121
That's good to hear, Peta. Excuse me.

14:44.801 --> 14:46.800
Oh, it's not so much
morning sickness -

14:46.801 --> 14:48.919
I feel like I could
throw up all day.

14:48.944 --> 14:52.533
See, that's another reason
I never had kids - I hate to chuck.

14:52.801 --> 14:54.800
Everything OK?
Yes, good.

14:54.801 --> 14:56.801
Welcome back, everyone.

14:57.801 --> 15:00.800
Alright, well, we've answered
a lot of the big questions,

15:00.801 --> 15:02.800
like, who killed Todd Wilson,

15:02.801 --> 15:04.800
how was Simon Hamilton involved

15:04.801 --> 15:06.800
and how were the Nobakhts connected?

15:06.801 --> 15:08.801
But the central question remains -

15:08.826 --> 15:12.302
who is importing and distributing
these prohibited Zodiacs?

15:12.303 --> 15:16.801
Well, today...
that question will be answered.

16:01.801 --> 16:04.800
Mr Boccaro,
when the Commission was suspended,

16:04.801 --> 16:06.800
we ceased active surveillance

16:06.801 --> 16:12.800
on a particular container
at Port Botany - JL134976.

16:12.801 --> 16:15.272
Do you know what was inside
that container?

16:15.297 --> 16:16.800
No idea.

16:16.801 --> 16:20.468
500 prohibited Zodiac handguns
hidden in fridges.

16:20.469 --> 16:21.800
We had to leave
those deadly weapons unwatched

16:21.801 --> 16:25.468
and when I checked in
with the harbourmaster this morning,

16:25.469 --> 16:27.800
he told me that the container
had been picked up a few days ago

16:27.801 --> 16:30.213
by a freight company,
destination unknown.

16:30.238 --> 16:31.800
Well, that is unfortunate.

16:31.801 --> 16:33.800
Would have been, yes,

16:33.801 --> 16:37.331
except that Commissioner King
authorised a single microcamera

16:37.356 --> 16:39.858
to be installed
inside that container.

16:46.303 --> 16:48.135
Really?

16:48.136 --> 16:51.635
Unfortunately, the trade-off
for size is limited capability.

16:51.636 --> 16:53.800
So the camera started transmitting
when the doors opened,

16:53.801 --> 16:54.800
but without a movement function,

16:54.801 --> 16:58.800
we just had to hope that
the right people walked into frame.

16:58.801 --> 17:02.390
It's a low-percentage strategy
but the only option left to us.

17:07.800 --> 17:08.800
Please.

17:13.800 --> 17:17.096
So, there you can see
the handguns hidden in the fridges.

17:17.121 --> 17:19.121
Genius.

17:19.800 --> 17:21.800
Oh, and just for the record,
we removed the firing pins

17:21.800 --> 17:24.859
so these guys are basically
being sold water pistols.

17:25.800 --> 17:29.801
But they're just the buyers -
they didn't arrange the importation.

17:38.801 --> 17:40.801
Recognise that car, Mr Boccaro?

17:48.303 --> 17:52.801
I'm sure you can confirm that
is you, Mr Boccaro. Am I right?

18:09.801 --> 18:13.800
That is you receiving $8 million
for prohibited firearms

18:13.801 --> 18:16.801
illegally imported by you, yes?

18:31.800 --> 18:33.800
(CORK POPS)
(CHEERING AND WHOOPING)

18:33.801 --> 18:35.800
Um, I just...
I want to thank you all.

18:35.801 --> 18:37.800
Everyone's played a vital role.

18:37.801 --> 18:40.800
The hours, days, weeks...
Don't forget the months.

18:40.801 --> 18:43.800
..and months of hard work of bringing
Patrick Boccaro to justice

18:43.801 --> 18:46.135
is an achievement that we all share.

18:46.136 --> 18:48.468
So, really, cheers.

18:48.469 --> 18:50.801
ALL: Cheers.

18:51.801 --> 18:53.468
Thanks.
BIANCA: Who would've thought?

18:53.469 --> 18:55.293
Get yourself a drink.
Thank you.

18:55.318 --> 18:56.968
Hey. Don't you want one?

18:56.969 --> 19:00.800
(SIGHS) Still can't believe it.
What an evil, weak bastard.

19:00.801 --> 19:02.801
Oh, well. Cheers.

19:03.801 --> 19:05.800
Congratulations.

19:05.801 --> 19:07.800
Mm, thank you.

19:07.801 --> 19:11.800
Very impressive hearing. Does
rather rain on my parade, of course.

19:11.801 --> 19:14.978
I've just gifted the bloke
five hectares of Crown land.

19:14.979 --> 19:16.979
Political fallout won't be pretty.

19:17.004 --> 19:18.968
Still, slings and arrows.

19:18.969 --> 19:21.911
You've done a tremendous job
with this Commission -

19:21.936 --> 19:24.800
impressed people, including myself.

19:24.801 --> 19:26.800
I was just saying
to the Premier the other day,

19:26.801 --> 19:28.800
we need more women judges.

19:28.801 --> 19:31.860
And younger women, too.
You're offering me a new job.

19:31.885 --> 19:34.800
Well, certainly canvassing
future options.

19:34.801 --> 19:35.800
And I do have the influence,

19:35.801 --> 19:37.801
and your skills
should be put to their best use.

19:37.802 --> 19:39.800
I haven't finished this job yet.

19:39.801 --> 19:42.800
Well, what could be bigger
than exposing Boccaro?

19:42.801 --> 19:45.449
Have you got one of these
new models, Lincoln?

19:45.474 --> 19:47.800
Great camera -
you could make a movie.

19:47.801 --> 19:52.801
After we saw that surveillance
footage, Owen followed Patrick.

19:55.801 --> 19:58.136
(VIDEO PLAYS)

20:00.801 --> 20:02.801
PATRICK: Mr Attorney-General.

20:03.550 --> 20:05.549
I hope you're still in the market
for some fine china.

20:05.550 --> 20:07.550
Matter of fact, I am.

20:11.550 --> 20:13.549
An anniversary gift for my wife,

20:13.550 --> 20:16.549
although she prefers diamonds,
apparently.

20:16.550 --> 20:18.786
That is precisely
what I'm looking for.

20:19.550 --> 20:22.550
Thank you.
Take care.

20:33.550 --> 20:36.549
How much was in that suitcase?

20:36.550 --> 20:40.217
Four million? Five? The whole eight?

20:40.218 --> 20:45.550
That was a private sale,
entirely between myself and Boccaro.

20:45.551 --> 20:48.550
And it was totally unrelated to your
decision to sell Patrick Boccaro

20:48.551 --> 20:52.549
an incredibly valuable
piece of Crown land for only $1.

20:52.550 --> 20:56.549
Completely. I discussed
that decision with my colleagues.

20:56.550 --> 20:59.549
Some of who, no doubt, also got
a chunk of Boccaro's money, yes?

20:59.550 --> 21:02.549
I mean, why should it go
to the general state revenue

21:02.550 --> 21:04.549
when it can end up in your pocket?

21:04.550 --> 21:08.217
That land sale was approved by
Cabinet, went through due process.

21:08.218 --> 21:09.549
After Patrick Boccaro
made you an offer

21:09.550 --> 21:11.550
for a tea set you couldn't refuse.

21:11.551 --> 21:14.493
That was a perfectly legal sale
of private property

21:14.518 --> 21:18.182
with a price agreed
between two willing parties.

21:18.550 --> 21:20.550
Well, you may be right.

21:24.550 --> 21:25.885
Let me ask you this.

21:27.885 --> 21:30.549
The murder that started
this Royal Commission

21:30.550 --> 21:33.549
turned out to be
Jane Carter's crime of passion.

21:33.550 --> 21:36.549
Patrick Boccaro turned out to be
an importer of illegal weapons,

21:36.550 --> 21:39.727
and then you sell him a tea set
for millions of dollars

21:39.752 --> 21:42.549
in the same week
you gift him public land.

21:42.550 --> 21:47.051
So, who's the biggest enemy to
public safety - Jane, Patrick or you?

21:47.052 --> 21:49.549
I had no idea about the importation
of those guns.

21:49.550 --> 21:51.727
It only happened because you're here.

21:51.728 --> 21:54.317
Organised crime can exist
without corruption,

21:54.342 --> 21:56.829
but it can't grow without corruption.

21:57.550 --> 21:59.548
So now I've finished the job
you asked me to do -

21:59.549 --> 22:01.550
I've uncovered who's at the bottom

22:01.551 --> 22:04.140
of the upsurge in firearm crime
in this city.

22:04.165 --> 22:06.549
Irony. Bummer, isn't it?

22:06.550 --> 22:10.384
It'll all be in the report you
were so keen for. Every last word.

22:10.385 --> 22:12.717
No actions of mine
have contravened the Crimes Act.

22:12.718 --> 22:16.483
You can either step down now,
Lincoln, before my report comes out

22:16.508 --> 22:20.097
or you can wait to see how
the public react to your behaviour.

22:20.550 --> 22:23.080
It's a shame no-one
got to hear about yours.

22:23.105 --> 22:25.549
Yeah, well, this isn't about me.

22:25.550 --> 22:28.550
So I'll leave your decision
in your capable hands.

22:35.550 --> 22:38.021
Of course,
now you'll never know the answer

22:38.046 --> 22:40.517
to the one murder
you most wanted to solve.

22:41.550 --> 22:43.550
At least that's some consolation.

22:53.550 --> 22:56.549
BIANCA: Those weren't the first
illegal weapons you've imported.

22:56.550 --> 22:58.884
This one's been in the country
for at least two years.

22:58.885 --> 23:00.549
Been used in several serious crimes,

23:00.550 --> 23:03.549
most recently the drive-by shooting
Brett Bonar did on the Nobakhts

23:03.550 --> 23:06.962
to frighten them into being
the contact for your container.

23:06.987 --> 23:09.986
Did Brett look after
many of your guns?

23:10.885 --> 23:12.549
That gun was found
at Brett Bonar's house.

23:12.550 --> 23:14.609
Was he the only person who used it?

23:14.610 --> 23:17.609
Well, Todd Wilson might have. He was
the turkey who stole it from my car.

23:17.610 --> 23:19.549
I told Brett to get it back.

23:19.550 --> 23:21.051
But not before you used it
for the drive-by?

23:21.052 --> 23:22.884
But before that,
did you lend it to others?

23:22.885 --> 23:25.709
I'm not much of a one
for lending valuable items.

23:25.710 --> 23:27.710
People don't respect a thing
unless they pay for it.

23:27.711 --> 23:29.549
So you hired out the gun?

23:29.550 --> 23:31.217
If someone comes to me
with a problem,

23:31.218 --> 23:33.549
I'll sit down with them
for a coffee, see if I can help.

23:33.550 --> 23:36.550
Couple of years ago,
a woman called Ashleigh Larsson

23:36.575 --> 23:38.549
was killed by that gun.

23:38.550 --> 23:40.845
Who'd you share a coffee with
that time?

23:40.870 --> 23:43.165
No, I don't think
my memory's that good.

23:44.375 --> 23:47.374
We're going to find that man
with or without you.

23:47.375 --> 23:49.374
We know all about
your relationship with him.

23:49.375 --> 23:52.373
We know that man told you George
Healy was about to talk to us.

23:52.374 --> 23:53.374
We know he was there

23:53.375 --> 23:55.374
when Brett carried out
your order to kill George.

23:55.375 --> 23:57.876
That same man said
we had surveillance on the container

23:57.877 --> 24:00.374
and that he broke into
the Royal Commission office

24:00.375 --> 24:01.374
and stole Commissioner King's iPad.

24:01.375 --> 24:03.374
So, you see,
we're this close to him.

24:03.375 --> 24:06.493
No, they were close to you.
You weren't close to them.

24:06.494 --> 24:09.671
You've got things so arse about
you'll never find them.

24:09.696 --> 24:13.042
Cooperation will improve
your position, Patrick.

24:13.043 --> 24:14.374
Really?

24:14.375 --> 24:16.374
What can you offer me -

24:16.375 --> 24:21.374
discounted sentence
immunity from prosecution.

24:21.375 --> 24:23.374
And even if you could
knock a couple of years off,

24:23.375 --> 24:25.876
I still wouldn't tell you
what you want to know,

24:25.877 --> 24:28.374
'cause that person
who killed Ash Larsson by mistake,

24:28.375 --> 24:32.374
they'll have another crack at Janet
King in the next couple of days

24:32.375 --> 24:35.199
and I will be there,
cheering from the sidelines.

24:35.375 --> 24:37.374
So, hug your kids tight

24:37.375 --> 24:40.375
and say goodbye, you smart bitch.

24:52.375 --> 24:54.209
It was meant to scare you.

24:54.210 --> 24:55.709
He's getting revenge
the only way he can.

24:55.710 --> 24:59.475
He said they were coming for me,
but why did he mention the kids?

24:59.500 --> 25:01.374
He mentioned the kids.

25:01.375 --> 25:04.042
It's just a fear campaign. Don't
give him the reaction he wants.

25:04.043 --> 25:05.374
Really?

25:05.375 --> 25:07.374
We'll look after you.
Nothing's going to happen.

25:07.375 --> 25:10.493
You heard him say that we had
Ash's killer arse about,

25:10.518 --> 25:12.374
so what have we missed?

25:12.375 --> 25:14.709
He said he was close to us.

25:14.710 --> 25:17.375
OK, what haven't we found?

25:18.375 --> 25:21.375
This is the lab report from Holland
on the DNA of the balaclava,

25:21.376 --> 25:23.374
and if you look at the mutations,

25:23.375 --> 25:25.611
we've got the warrior gene,
freckles...

25:25.636 --> 25:28.374
But this one -
'androgen insensitivity'.

25:28.375 --> 25:31.375
Let me look it up. 'Androgen'...

25:32.375 --> 25:34.210
What's this say?

25:35.877 --> 25:38.374
"What is androgen insensitivity?"
OK.

25:38.375 --> 25:42.542
"The newborn AIS infant
has undescended testes

25:42.543 --> 25:46.374
"but external genitals
of normal female appearance,

25:46.375 --> 25:49.375
"though they do not menstruate
and are not fertile."

25:50.375 --> 25:51.374
What?

25:51.375 --> 25:54.209
So the DNA reads male, it's XY,

25:54.210 --> 25:57.375
but because of the mutation,
they'll look female.

25:59.375 --> 26:02.374
We were thinking it's a man -
it's a woman.

26:02.375 --> 26:04.375
A childless woman.

26:08.375 --> 26:10.374
Heather.

26:10.375 --> 26:12.374
What?

26:12.375 --> 26:13.709
It's been bothering me for weeks,

26:13.710 --> 26:15.375
the amount of coincidences
involving her,

26:15.376 --> 26:18.209
the fact she can't account
for where she was that night.

26:18.210 --> 26:20.858
No, I mean, she's been on the team
for months.

26:20.883 --> 26:22.374
Who appointed her? You?

26:22.375 --> 26:27.374
No. Lincoln. He asked around
for a good local solicitor.

26:27.375 --> 26:30.374
Asked who? His mate Patrick?

26:30.375 --> 26:33.670
No, I can see where
you're going with this, but I just...

26:35.375 --> 26:36.543
It can't be her.

26:38.877 --> 26:42.374
Why would Heather
want to kill Ash or you?

26:42.375 --> 26:43.708
Look, this may not mean anything,

26:43.709 --> 26:47.209
but I know she blames me
for convicting one of her clients.

26:47.210 --> 26:49.374
Who?
Jandamarra Doherty.

26:49.375 --> 26:51.374
What was the case?
Rape.

26:51.375 --> 26:55.317
She swears the girl was lying.
She mentioned it to me the other day.

26:55.342 --> 26:58.008
Well, I'll see
if he's on the system, but...

26:58.710 --> 27:00.374
(SIGHS)
..I mean, she's been so dedicated.

27:00.375 --> 27:02.374
I'm just looking at the facts, Andy.

27:02.375 --> 27:03.374
Someone's clearly after Janet,

27:03.375 --> 27:06.374
and, whoever they are, they've been
privy to all sorts of RC business.

27:06.375 --> 27:09.374
And now this DNA thing shows
they're a woman without children.

27:09.375 --> 27:12.670
I can't believe Heather
sold George Healy out to Boccaro.

27:12.695 --> 27:16.695
She was with me when we found him.
She was devastated.

27:17.710 --> 27:19.374
Though...

27:19.375 --> 27:21.210
Though what?

27:22.375 --> 27:26.709
I mean, it was Heather who had given
herself time to tell Boccaro,

27:26.710 --> 27:30.209
then driven Brett over
to shut George up...

27:30.210 --> 27:31.709
And you heard Boccaro
say whoever killed Ash

27:31.710 --> 27:33.709
was going to try again
in a couple of days -

27:33.710 --> 27:35.534
'cause the RC will be packed up

27:35.559 --> 27:39.618
and Heather's access to Janet will
go from bloody easy to much harder.

27:46.375 --> 27:48.374
Andy was out half the night
on some Janet errand.

27:48.375 --> 27:50.374
I am all too familiar
with the all-night Janet errand.

27:50.375 --> 27:52.374
Might even miss those
when I've got my head

27:52.375 --> 27:54.493
buried in the books
for the bar exam.

27:54.494 --> 27:55.553
Mm...
Or maybe not.

27:55.578 --> 27:57.374
Morning.
Hey, stranger.

27:57.375 --> 28:00.374
I need you to come with me.
Are we going to talk to Boccaro?

28:00.375 --> 28:02.670
I'm placing you under arrest
for murder.

28:02.695 --> 28:04.813
(CHUCKLES) Pull the other one, spud.

28:06.375 --> 28:09.374
You are not obliged to do or say
anything if you don't wish to do so,

28:09.375 --> 28:12.374
but anything you do say
may be used in evidence.

28:12.375 --> 28:14.210
Do you understand?

28:34.375 --> 28:37.374
The afternoon George Healy
was found hanged

28:37.375 --> 28:39.905
you were absent
from the Commission building

28:39.930 --> 28:41.374
from 2:38pm to 4:09pm.

28:41.375 --> 28:44.375
Where were you?

28:45.375 --> 28:48.374
One month later,
your ID code was used

28:48.375 --> 28:50.905
to access the Commission office
after hours.

28:50.930 --> 28:52.930
Can you explain that?

28:54.375 --> 28:55.611
Property was stolen -

28:55.612 --> 28:59.260
Commission property and personal
items belonging to Janet King.

28:59.285 --> 29:01.374
Did you take them?
January 4, 2014.

29:01.375 --> 29:04.375
The night someone shot Ash Larsson,
where were you?

29:06.375 --> 29:09.209
We know you're good mates
with Patrick Boccaro.

29:09.210 --> 29:12.328
Did he supply you
with the firearm used in that crime?

29:14.375 --> 29:16.375
Jandamarra Doherty.

29:18.375 --> 29:23.374
Assault, B&E, resist arrest,
shoplifting, dealing, soliciting.

29:23.375 --> 29:26.081
Major charge sheet
since he did time for rape -

29:26.106 --> 29:28.771
a conviction secured by Janet King.

29:31.375 --> 29:35.375
You were close to Jandamarra
before he went down.

29:38.375 --> 29:41.493
You've got a grudge against Janet
over him, don't you?

29:41.518 --> 29:44.374
Well, it says so
right there on your phone.

29:44.375 --> 29:46.542
August 7, 2012, 11:14am,

29:46.543 --> 29:50.374
you sent a text
to a colleague in your office -

29:50.375 --> 29:51.374
"Fucking Janet King.

29:51.375 --> 29:53.374
"These prosecutors never understand
the pain they cause.

29:53.375 --> 29:55.375
"If I got her alone at the moment,
I'd kill her."

29:55.376 --> 29:58.374
An email to your brother
a few days later -

29:58.375 --> 29:59.875
"I saw that King bitch on TV again.

29:59.876 --> 30:01.374
"When I think about the damage
she's done,

30:01.375 --> 30:03.374
"I'd like to give her a taste
of her own medicine."

30:03.375 --> 30:05.374
There's a whole string of them -
bitter, violent.

30:05.375 --> 30:08.317
And then they all stop
after Ash Larsson is killed.

30:08.342 --> 30:10.342
What do you say to that?

30:11.375 --> 30:16.374
Andy, you can ask questions
until you're blue in the face.

30:16.375 --> 30:19.043
I'm not saying a bloody thing.

30:31.375 --> 30:34.375
It's all over the media.
The AG has just resigned.

30:35.375 --> 30:37.374
Has he, indeed?

30:37.375 --> 30:39.552
Well, then, it must be time for this.

30:39.577 --> 30:41.374
Thank you.

30:41.375 --> 30:42.542
What for?

30:42.543 --> 30:44.374
For not being a man
entirely of self-interest.

30:44.375 --> 30:47.374
Although, there will be
a by-election now,

30:47.375 --> 30:49.374
both parties will be looking for
an outstanding candidate.

30:49.375 --> 30:52.375
Don't you dare.
What, lead the DPP? Me? Never.

30:52.376 --> 30:54.374
Although, I might.

30:54.375 --> 30:56.375
Uh, it's probably best
that we don't touch Heather's desk.

30:56.376 --> 31:00.209
I know. It just seems unbelievable.
Yeah.

31:00.210 --> 31:01.709
Hey, you taking some time off?

31:01.710 --> 31:03.374
I'll have to write the report
for the Governor

31:03.375 --> 31:05.374
and then I'm going to
pick up the kids,

31:05.375 --> 31:07.374
take them on a treat
overseas somewhere.

31:07.375 --> 31:09.374
How about you?
Oh, um... back to work, I suppose.

31:09.375 --> 31:11.709
Though it's tempting
to take some long-service leave,

31:11.710 --> 31:13.375
avoid trying to convict
child sex offenders.

31:13.376 --> 31:15.374
Save your leave
for after the baby's born -

31:15.375 --> 31:17.374
that's when you really
want to be home.

31:17.375 --> 31:19.042
With my little miracle. (CHUCKLES)

31:19.043 --> 31:20.514
I'm very excited for you.

31:20.515 --> 31:23.868
Your whole body will fill
with these amazing love hormones

31:23.893 --> 31:26.374
and it just makes you
a better human being.

31:26.375 --> 31:28.374
It really is miraculous.

31:28.375 --> 31:30.374
Yeah. Especially for us.

31:30.375 --> 31:32.374
I was given something
I wanted more than anything

31:32.375 --> 31:34.709
but thought I could never have.

31:34.710 --> 31:36.374
Hardly a better feeling
in the world.

31:36.375 --> 31:38.374
What's all this doing here still?

31:38.375 --> 31:41.374
Oh, Andy has to return everything
non-lethal to Brett's next of kin.

31:41.375 --> 31:43.374
Shitty job, really -
"Your son's been shot

31:43.375 --> 31:46.375
"but here is his wallet,
laser torch, elevator key

31:46.376 --> 31:49.374
"and phone
that you'll never call again."

31:49.375 --> 31:51.374
I'm going to finish packing up.
What about Richard?

31:51.375 --> 31:53.542
Oh, he was nearly finished
packing up when he got the call.

31:53.543 --> 31:55.375
What call?

31:57.375 --> 31:59.374
Why me?

31:59.375 --> 32:00.375
You're thorough,

32:00.376 --> 32:03.374
and we've been working together
for the last three months.

32:03.375 --> 32:06.374
I just need someone
to represent me at the bail hearing.

32:06.375 --> 32:09.374
For a murder charge, you have to
prove exceptional circumstances.

32:09.375 --> 32:11.374
How about a piss-weak Crown case?

32:11.375 --> 32:14.374
Ties to the jurisdiction,
40 years old,

32:14.375 --> 32:17.493
no prior convictions,
not even a fucking parking fine.

32:17.518 --> 32:19.374
I'll do daily reporting.

32:19.375 --> 32:21.375
Now should I be granted bail?

32:23.256 --> 32:25.374
Where were you during the 90 minutes

32:25.375 --> 32:27.876
you weren't at the Commission
on the afternoon George died?

32:27.877 --> 32:30.876
Meeting with Patrick Boccaro about
his tender for the netball courts.

32:30.877 --> 32:32.374
Well, they claim
he's a co-conspirator,

32:32.375 --> 32:34.552
so an alibi from him
has little value.

32:34.577 --> 32:36.577
But true, nonetheless.

32:37.375 --> 32:39.964
And the night the Royal Commission
was robbed

32:39.989 --> 32:41.813
by someone using your passcode?

32:45.375 --> 32:46.877
I was with Dale Cardy.

32:47.877 --> 32:49.374
The... the footballer?

32:49.375 --> 32:51.374
Yes.

32:51.375 --> 32:54.374
Isn't he, like, just out of school?

32:54.375 --> 32:56.042
He's 23.

32:56.043 --> 32:58.749
Which is why I'd rather
not go public with that

32:58.774 --> 33:01.374
until we absolutely have to.

33:01.375 --> 33:03.374
There's no evidence it was me,

33:03.375 --> 33:06.542
except the passcode,
which is highly circumstantial.

33:06.543 --> 33:10.375
Even without an alibi,
their case is as weak as water.

33:12.375 --> 33:14.374
What about Jandamarra Doherty?

33:14.375 --> 33:19.374
You sent a lot of emotive texts
and emails about Janet

33:19.375 --> 33:21.374
after she secured his conviction.

33:21.375 --> 33:22.375
Yeah.

33:23.375 --> 33:25.374
I was very emotional.

33:25.375 --> 33:28.374
Jandy is my nephew,

33:28.375 --> 33:31.611
and he was a bloody good kid
and Janet sent him to jail.

33:31.612 --> 33:34.730
And he's come out with
a real serious addiction to ice

33:34.755 --> 33:37.517
which is leading him
to all sorts of shit.

33:39.375 --> 33:41.374
Why don't you represent yourself?

33:41.375 --> 33:44.023
Because I'll probably
end up slapping someone.

33:44.375 --> 33:50.043
Richard... I'm being charged
with murder and I need your help.

33:51.710 --> 33:53.877
Why wouldn't you represent me?

34:24.375 --> 34:28.373
Richard, I hear you're acting
for Heather O'Connor.

34:28.375 --> 34:30.373
Only for the bail application.

34:30.375 --> 34:32.905
Are you aware of what she's done?
Allegedly.

34:32.929 --> 34:35.373
Well, when the DNA match comes back,

34:35.375 --> 34:37.728
there won't be much 'allegedly'
about it.

34:37.753 --> 34:40.373
If it's positive.
The odds are pretty good.

34:40.375 --> 34:42.373
Maybe.

34:42.375 --> 34:44.710
But until then,
the evidence is comparatively weak

34:44.710 --> 34:47.373
and I believe that bail
should be granted.

34:47.375 --> 34:49.042
Uh, I'm off.

34:49.043 --> 34:51.042
OK.
Lina, thanks, great job.

34:51.043 --> 34:52.373
If you need help with the report...

34:52.375 --> 34:55.552
Yeah, I'll be in touch.
OK. Yeah. See you next weekend?

34:55.577 --> 34:57.245
Sounds good.

35:00.375 --> 35:02.375
The DNA results get back
in a couple of days.

35:02.376 --> 35:05.374
It'll rule her out if she's innocent.
She could just wait.

35:05.375 --> 35:07.709
She is entitled to apply for bail.
Don't give me that shit, Richard.

35:07.710 --> 35:09.374
You know the stats of crimes
committed by people

35:09.375 --> 35:11.374
who get out on bail -
it's staggering.

35:11.375 --> 35:12.374
That is hardly always the case.

35:12.375 --> 35:14.374
Why do you think Heather's
so desperate to get out?

35:14.375 --> 35:16.374
You know the evidence
is circumstantial.

35:16.375 --> 35:17.374
She's using you!

35:17.375 --> 35:20.374
She knows you're on some bandwagon
to prove your independence.

35:20.375 --> 35:23.374
I mean, for Christ's sake, Richard,
of all cases!

35:23.375 --> 35:25.374
The first principles, Janet!

35:25.375 --> 35:28.374
First principles!

35:28.375 --> 35:31.375
Everyone is entitled
to the presumption of innocence

35:31.376 --> 35:32.671
and to representation.

35:32.696 --> 35:35.374
I won't be the one
making a decision on bail.

35:35.375 --> 35:38.199
I will put her case
as the police will put yours.

35:38.224 --> 35:42.889
And, please, stop expecting me
to always just do what you want!

36:09.375 --> 36:11.374
So if you don't want to
miss the bail hearing,

36:11.375 --> 36:12.374
why don't I pick up the kids? Easy.

36:12.375 --> 36:14.374
Sounds good, thanks, Tony.

36:14.375 --> 36:18.374
And, uh, if she makes bail,
we'll stay on here?

36:18.375 --> 36:22.611
With the kids, yeah, until Heather's
back inside. I've got that approved.

36:22.612 --> 36:24.907
I could even stay
if she doesn't make it

36:24.932 --> 36:28.695
until we're absolutely sure
there's no further threat.

36:30.375 --> 36:32.209
Had enough?

36:32.210 --> 36:34.374
Yes, thank you. Well, I'm off.

36:34.375 --> 36:36.374
Night.

36:36.375 --> 36:38.374
So, that's the undercover officer
who was in your...

36:38.375 --> 36:40.552
ON.
..ON your bed when the SCC raided.

36:40.577 --> 36:42.374
Yeah.
Seems nice.

36:42.375 --> 36:43.374
She is.

36:43.375 --> 36:45.964
So, through all this mess,
a ray of sunshine.

36:45.989 --> 36:48.209
She hasn't moved in, Tony.
Mm.

36:48.210 --> 36:50.374
Would you like me
to have a word with Mr Stirling,

36:50.375 --> 36:52.374
volunteer a definition
of the word 'loyalty'?

36:52.375 --> 36:55.374
Well, he accepted a brief
like any professional lawyer should,

36:55.375 --> 36:57.374
but pretty big betrayal.

36:57.375 --> 36:59.375
Mm. Shame, that.

36:59.376 --> 37:03.542
Ah, well, career-saving advocate
one week, bus driver the next.

37:03.543 --> 37:06.374
Thank you.
Mm. Anytime, as ever.

37:06.375 --> 37:08.375
Thank you.

37:11.375 --> 37:13.209
Everything OK?

37:13.210 --> 37:17.374
Oh, yeah, I mean, you don't
have to go back into the car,

37:17.375 --> 37:19.374
unless... unless you want to.

37:19.375 --> 37:22.375
Only thing I don't want to do
is presume.

37:24.376 --> 37:26.375
Come on.

37:43.375 --> 37:48.375
Well, these are very serious charges
your client is facing, Mr Starling.

37:49.375 --> 37:52.374
Uh, it's 'Stirling', Your Honour.

37:52.375 --> 37:53.374
Um, our application for bail

37:53.375 --> 37:56.876
is purely based on the inherent
weakness of the Crown case.

37:56.877 --> 37:58.374
Hardly surprising.

37:58.375 --> 38:00.209
Your Honour, we're waiting
on the lab report

38:00.210 --> 38:01.374
testing Ms O'Connor's DNA.

38:01.375 --> 38:04.374
We anticipate it will strengthen
the case against the accused.

38:04.375 --> 38:07.042
I take it you're opposing bail.
We are, Your Honour.

38:07.043 --> 38:09.374
The accused poses
a very serious threat to Janet King

38:09.375 --> 38:12.374
and is a considerable flight risk.
Your Honour, this is nonsense.

38:12.375 --> 38:13.375
The evidence is weak
that Ms O'Connor

38:13.376 --> 38:16.374
poses a credible threat to anyone,
let alone Janet King.

38:16.375 --> 38:18.374
She is accused
of killing her partner.

38:18.375 --> 38:20.374
Ms O'Connor
has no prior convictions,

38:20.375 --> 38:22.374
she owns a house here,
her parents live in the area,

38:22.375 --> 38:24.542
she's willing to consent
to onerous daily reporting...

38:24.543 --> 38:26.374
Enough, enough.

38:26.375 --> 38:28.374
If the strength of the evidence
is in dispute,

38:28.375 --> 38:30.374
we have the police informant here,
Your Honour.

38:30.375 --> 38:32.374
Court may wish to hear from him.

38:32.375 --> 38:34.375
Thank you. Let's.

38:41.375 --> 38:46.374
Can you read the text quoted in
your affidavit, please, Inspector?

38:46.375 --> 38:48.709
"To hell with fucking Janet King.

38:48.710 --> 38:51.374
"These prosecutors never understand
the pain they cause.

38:51.375 --> 38:54.199
"If I got her alone at the moment,
I'd kill her."

38:54.224 --> 38:56.042
And when was that text sent?

38:56.043 --> 38:58.374
Four weeks after Jandamarra Doherty
was sentenced.

38:58.375 --> 39:00.374
Do you know what prompted that text?

39:00.375 --> 39:04.375
A conversation one of Ms O'Connor's
other clients overheard in a pub.

39:04.376 --> 39:07.141
The girl whose evidence
had convicted Jandamarra

39:07.166 --> 39:10.374
had reportedly laughed about it
later on,

39:10.375 --> 39:14.374
saying, that'd teach him for
a punch-up he'd had with her brother.

39:14.375 --> 39:17.728
The victim boasted about
lying under oath, in other words.

39:17.753 --> 39:18.876
Apparently, yes.

39:18.877 --> 39:20.819
And that resulted in a conviction

39:20.820 --> 39:23.291
which ought to have been
overturned at law.

39:23.316 --> 39:25.374
Ms O'Connor clearly thought so.

39:25.375 --> 39:28.374
And that led to a moment
of frustration and anger.

39:28.375 --> 39:31.375
It led to the murder
of Ashleigh Larsson.

39:35.375 --> 39:40.374
Do you have any evidence placing Ms
O'Connor at the scene of that crime?

39:40.375 --> 39:44.374
No, but we have other circumstantial
evidence that justifies this charge.

39:44.375 --> 39:46.374
We have evidence of a friendship

39:46.375 --> 39:49.374
between her and the man who owned
the gun that killed Ms Larsson.

39:49.375 --> 39:52.670
Do you have any direct evidence
supporting the allegation

39:52.695 --> 39:54.876
that Ms O'Connor
committed this crime?

39:54.877 --> 39:57.374
We have a clearly established motive.

39:57.375 --> 39:58.374
All the other information we have

39:58.375 --> 40:01.434
regarding the profile
of Ashleigh Larsson's killer...

40:01.435 --> 40:03.434

a yes or no, Inspector Campbell.

40:22.376 --> 40:24.375
No.

40:27.376 --> 40:31.209
Your Honour, if it assists
in easing the path to bail,

40:31.210 --> 40:33.374
Ms O'Connor is happy
to surrender her passport,

40:33.375 --> 40:35.374
report to Bankstown police station
twice a day

40:35.375 --> 40:38.434
and wear an electronic
monitoring device on her ankle

40:38.435 --> 40:41.434
to alert police if she travels
beyond a 5km radius from her home.

40:49.375 --> 40:51.374

40:51.375 --> 40:54.317
whether the exceptional
circumstances test for bail

40:54.342 --> 40:57.374
has been met
and give my decision this afternoon.

so it'll come straight to you.

41:08.375 --> 41:11.042
We'll get it much faster now
than a plain DNA match.

41:11.043 --> 41:13.374
That should be enough
to get him to reject bail.

41:13.375 --> 41:16.374
Got to help. Especially if
it's an obvious likeness.

41:16.375 --> 41:18.373
It's drawn straight from
the genome code of Ash's killer.

41:18.374 --> 41:21.610

from one strand of DNA?

41:21.635 --> 41:24.709

but some of them are uncanny.
