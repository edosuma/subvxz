Dr. Wedlind:
Oh, there can be no doubt
this is a specimen

01:13.920 --> 01:16.620
of genus isolatus slinkalonkis.

01:16.620 --> 01:21.170
The elusive and very shy
solitary tree shrewzle.

01:21.170 --> 01:24.120
But Dr. Wedlind,
I thought tree shrewzles

01:24.120 --> 01:25.960
were practically extinct.

01:25.960 --> 01:28.000
Cruella:
So did everyone, darling.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.960
There hasn't been one
spotted locally for ages.

01:30.960 --> 01:32.250
Until now.

01:32.250 --> 01:35.460
When Ms. De Vil told me she took
this photo on your farm,

01:35.460 --> 01:38.540
I nearly wept for joy!

01:38.540 --> 01:39.880
Wait-- wait a minute,

01:39.880 --> 01:42.330
you were taking photos
on our farm?

01:42.330 --> 01:44.540
Well, it's amazing
what you can stumble across

01:44.540 --> 01:47.000
with a super-telescopic
anamorphic night vision lens.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.080
Scam alert.
Total scam alert.

01:50.080 --> 01:51.880
Cruella's up to something.

01:51.880 --> 01:53.880
How interesting,

01:53.880 --> 01:56.040
a tree shrewzle
living right here.

01:56.040 --> 01:57.710
Interesting.

01:57.710 --> 02:00.120
It's one of mother nature's
miracles unfolding

02:00.120 --> 02:02.250
before our very eyes!

02:02.250 --> 02:04.330
Of course, being endangered,

02:04.330 --> 02:07.750
the shrewzle's habitat
will have to be protected.

02:07.750 --> 02:09.540
Protected?

02:09.540 --> 02:11.880
By environmental law, Rotter.

02:11.880 --> 02:13.960
Living so close
to such a delicate creature

02:13.960 --> 02:17.000
will require you to make
a few, uh, adjustments.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.380
Tell him, Doctor.

02:19.420 --> 02:21.920
Under penalty of law,
you will be required

02:21.920 --> 02:24.500
to
whisper when you talk,

02:24.500 --> 02:26.000
tip-toe when you walk,

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
unplug all of your
electrical appliances,

02:28.000 --> 02:30.080
and trade in your cars
for llamas.

02:30.080 --> 02:32.420
Since the tree shrewzle
is nocturnal,

02:32.420 --> 02:35.880
you must curtail all activity
during its daylight sleep cycle

02:35.880 --> 02:38.170
and for the three months
of its mating season,

02:38.170 --> 02:39.790
you'll have to wear blindfolds.

02:39.790 --> 02:44.040
Well, I suppose we'd be willing
to make a few concessions.

02:44.040 --> 02:47.500
Of course, a creature
as shy as the tree shrewzle

02:47.500 --> 02:49.420
could never, ever tolerate

02:49.420 --> 02:54.080
the presence of 101 spotty,
yappy mongrels.

02:54.080 --> 02:57.040
Oh, yes, dogs would be
a definite no-no.

02:57.040 --> 02:59.120
What did I tell ya?

02:59.120 --> 03:00.250
Here we go.

03:00.250 --> 03:02.880
We will never give up our dogs!

03:02.880 --> 03:06.420
Then you'll just have to
vacate the property!

03:06.420 --> 03:09.120
The only feasible solution
is for me to buy your farm

03:09.120 --> 03:12.380
and turn it into
a tree shrewzle sanctuary.

03:12.380 --> 03:16.210
Sell the

03:16.210 --> 03:19.080
Look, we love animals
as much as anyone,

03:19.080 --> 03:20.830
but before we give up our home,

03:20.830 --> 03:23.210
we'll need more proof
than a blurry photograph.

03:23.210 --> 03:26.210
I too would thrill
to see the shrewzle.

03:26.210 --> 03:28.790
It would be the crowning
achievement of my career

03:28.790 --> 03:30.250
in the wild.

03:30.250 --> 03:33.250
Well then, let's all
meet back here tonight.

03:33.250 --> 03:35.500
We'll just go out
and take a look-see

03:35.500 --> 03:38.250
at this shrewzle
for ourselves.

03:41.830 --> 03:44.830
Aw, if there was
a real shrewzle around here,

03:44.830 --> 03:46.040
I woulda smelled it.

03:46.040 --> 03:48.880
Shrewzle's a very distinct odor.

03:48.880 --> 03:51.880
It's-- it's more gamey
than squirrel

03:51.880 --> 03:54.250
and it's--
it's less musky
than a raccoon.

03:54.250 --> 03:56.080
It's-- it's kind of
like a beaver

03:56.080 --> 03:58.250
but a little less mildewy.

03:58.250 --> 04:01.670
Well, Cruella
sure seemed confident
that one would show up.

04:01.670 --> 04:03.830
A little too confident.

04:03.830 --> 04:07.170
If you ask me, this is
just a shrewzle bamboozle,

04:07.170 --> 04:09.460
and we're gonna prove it.

04:13.710 --> 04:15.750
Hear that?

04:15.750 --> 04:18.460
There isn't a square inch
on this farm

04:18.460 --> 04:21.250
a shrewzle could show his snout
and not be seen.

04:21.250 --> 04:23.960
Great. Now what do we do?

04:23.960 --> 04:27.120
We wait and stay alert.

04:43.750 --> 04:46.750
Shrewzle alert!

04:51.710 --> 04:53.580
The bark came from around here.

05:00.540 --> 05:02.170
That shrewzle
you're so hot to find

05:02.170 --> 05:04.880
climbed up the silo
10 minutes ago.

05:04.880 --> 05:06.380
Look! There!

05:06.380 --> 05:07.710
Halfway up!

05:10.120 --> 05:11.920
Well I'll be, it's a--

05:11.920 --> 05:14.040
Cruella:
A solitary tree shrewzle.

05:15.670 --> 05:18.540
See? Up there in the tower.

05:18.540 --> 05:20.080
That's a tree shrewzle?

05:20.080 --> 05:23.000
That's isolatus
slinkalonkis all right.

05:23.000 --> 05:27.750
Oh, isn't he magnificent?

05:27.750 --> 05:29.210
Astonishing!

05:29.210 --> 05:32.290
I've never seen that behavior
described in the literature!

05:32.290 --> 05:34.790
This is sublime!

05:34.790 --> 05:37.170
Aren't they supposed to be shy?

05:37.170 --> 05:38.460
Well, that's enough.

05:38.460 --> 05:40.670
Mustn't upset
the timid little fellow.

05:40.670 --> 05:42.170
Well, seeing is believing.

05:42.170 --> 05:45.210
Everybody back to the house.
We have business to attend to.

05:45.210 --> 05:48.080
You did keep my contract
to buy the farm, Rutger?

05:48.080 --> 05:49.670
Oh, no. I'm not gonna sign

05:49.670 --> 05:51.500
till I have a lawyer
to look it over.

05:51.500 --> 05:52.670
Maybe two.

05:53.790 --> 05:56.580
Cruella:
Well, tomorrow then,
and no later.

05:56.580 --> 06:00.460
We must consider
the animal's welfare
at all costs!

06:00.460 --> 06:01.710
Did you see that?

06:01.710 --> 06:04.710
How did Cruella know
the shrewzle would be here?

06:04.710 --> 06:08.580
Yeah, and that shrewzle
acted pretty squirrelly
if you ask me.

06:08.580 --> 06:10.330
It doesn't smell right either.

06:10.330 --> 06:11.710
It smells like...

06:11.710 --> 06:13.380
polyester?

06:16.380 --> 06:17.790
He's sneaking away!

06:19.460 --> 06:21.710
Quick! Follow that shrewzle!

06:43.380 --> 06:44.540
Where'd he go?

06:47.750 --> 06:52.170
Well, that clever shrewzle
certainly gave us
the slip, all right.

06:52.170 --> 06:53.500
All:
Huh?

06:53.500 --> 06:55.500
Guess we better
call it a night.

06:55.500 --> 06:57.620
Why are you yelling?

06:57.620 --> 06:59.460
Trust me, guys.

06:59.460 --> 07:02.170
Let's go home.

07:02.170 --> 07:04.540
Spot:
Okay.

07:12.330 --> 07:15.250
Gotcha.

07:44.500 --> 07:47.920
It's Scorch
in a shrewzle costume!

07:47.920 --> 07:49.790
I knew it was a scam!

07:49.790 --> 07:51.580
Am I a genius or what?

07:51.580 --> 07:53.790
How do we tell
Roger and Anita?

07:53.790 --> 07:55.620
We only have till tomorrow.

07:55.620 --> 07:57.580
That's when they sell the farm.

07:57.580 --> 08:01.620
No way! We'll just have to
come up with a counter-scam.

08:05.080 --> 08:07.250
Hey! Hey!
What's going on?

08:07.250 --> 08:10.330
It's for the observation lab.

08:10.330 --> 08:13.540
No shrewzle sanctuary
would be complete without one.

08:13.540 --> 08:15.500
No, not so fast.

08:15.500 --> 08:17.120
This isn't a sanctuary yet.

08:17.120 --> 08:18.460
This is still my home.

08:19.670 --> 08:21.620
At least, it is
for the next 20 minutes

08:21.620 --> 08:23.880
or whenever Cruella gets here
with the check.

08:38.250 --> 08:39.420
Huh?

08:46.540 --> 08:48.000
Ah...

09:04.580 --> 09:06.040
Huh?

09:09.790 --> 09:12.540
There. That oughta hold him.

09:12.540 --> 09:14.880
Oh, quick!
Help me get into this!

09:19.460 --> 09:23.000
I want to do this
as sensitively as possible.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.540
Get out.

09:27.250 --> 09:29.460
-Roger: It's the tree shrewzle!

09:29.460 --> 09:31.540
No! It's not possible!

09:31.540 --> 09:34.710
The tree shrewzle?
During the day?

09:39.040 --> 09:42.620
Fascinating. It looks like
he's beckoning to us.

09:42.620 --> 09:46.670
Well, he's--
he's obviously suffering
from mad shrewzle disease.

09:46.670 --> 09:48.040
-Ignore him.
-No.

09:48.040 --> 09:50.620
When nature calls,
we must answer.

09:50.620 --> 09:53.710
Cherchez la shrewzle!

09:56.380 --> 09:58.170
Oh, this is ludicrous.

09:58.170 --> 09:59.500
Shush!

10:02.460 --> 10:04.460
Over there!

10:04.460 --> 10:07.170
Ooh, ooh, watch your step. Ooh.

10:12.670 --> 10:14.500
Oh well, we lost him.
Let's go back.

10:16.460 --> 10:18.460
Hey, no!

10:18.460 --> 10:20.960
Ugh.

10:20.960 --> 10:23.750
I'm sure I saw him
dart this way.

10:23.750 --> 10:25.830
But this is my backyard!

10:25.830 --> 10:27.710
He wouldn't dare come here.

10:27.710 --> 10:29.170
Shush!

10:29.170 --> 10:32.670
-Sha-na-na-na-na!
Na-na-na-na-na!
-Dr. Wedlind: There he is!

10:34.290 --> 10:35.620
But it's not done yet!

10:35.620 --> 10:36.830
Close enough!

10:38.000 --> 10:39.330
Dr. Wedlind:
Oh joy!

10:39.330 --> 10:41.170
He's built a nest!

10:41.170 --> 10:43.420
He's established
a home, Ms. De Vil.

10:43.420 --> 10:46.330
Imagine these wondrous creatures

10:46.330 --> 10:49.460
returning to our little slice
of the eco pie.

10:49.460 --> 10:52.500
Where he builds it,
we shall come.

10:52.500 --> 10:55.880
We will set up
the sanctuary here.

10:55.880 --> 10:58.120
My-- my home,

10:58.120 --> 11:00.420
a sanctuary?

11:00.420 --> 11:02.920
Aw, it won't be
so bad, Cruella.

11:02.920 --> 11:05.710
You'll just have to make
a few adjustments.

11:05.710 --> 11:07.580
Whisper when you talk...

11:07.580 --> 11:09.500
Tip-toe when you walk...

11:09.500 --> 11:11.210
Unplug your appliances...

11:11.210 --> 11:12.580
Anita:
Sell your cars...

11:12.580 --> 11:15.460
Roger:
And don't forget the blindfold!

11:15.460 --> 11:19.210
Somehow I expect
this shrewzle may be
migrating soon.

11:19.210 --> 11:22.460
-Very soon.
-It's possible.

11:22.460 --> 11:25.120
Shrewzles remain
one of nature's enigmas.

11:25.120 --> 11:27.420
Mysterious, unfathomable.

11:27.420 --> 11:28.830
-That's odd.

11:28.830 --> 11:31.920
This one seems
to have made friends with
some of the local fauna.

11:31.920 --> 11:34.420
Fascinating!

12:10.380 --> 12:12.420
Nobody attacks this farm

12:12.420 --> 12:15.750
as long as I, Luckybolt,
stand guard.

12:30.960 --> 12:33.330
Bones for everyone!

12:37.710 --> 12:41.290
Cadpig:
All hail Lucky,
our puppy guide!

12:41.290 --> 12:42.750
Puppies:
All hail Lucky!

12:42.750 --> 12:44.540
All hail Lucky!

12:44.540 --> 12:47.500
All hail Lucky!
All hail Lucky!

12:47.500 --> 12:49.330
Lucky? Lucky!

12:49.330 --> 12:51.120
Huh

12:51.120 --> 12:52.670
Come on,
it's dinnertime!

12:52.670 --> 12:55.000
Let's go
before the kibble's gone!

13:06.210 --> 13:07.960
Why are you looking
at me like that?

13:07.960 --> 13:09.920
Like what?

13:14.620 --> 13:16.790
Help! Help!

13:16.790 --> 13:19.960
Won't someone save me
from the evil king?

13:21.330 --> 13:23.250
Fear not, Princess Pigpunzel!

13:23.250 --> 13:26.790
Oh, my knight
in shining armor!

13:26.790 --> 13:28.500
Comin' at ya!

13:37.170 --> 13:38.290
Love to chat,

13:38.290 --> 13:40.120
but it's chow time.

13:42.080 --> 13:43.120
Both:
Whoa!

13:43.120 --> 13:44.960
-Whoa!
-Oh!

13:49.210 --> 13:51.290
Hey!

13:51.290 --> 13:53.670
Sorry about that, Dumpling.

13:53.670 --> 13:56.420
You saved my life.

13:56.420 --> 13:58.880
My hero!

13:58.880 --> 14:02.920
-I don't know if I'd use
the word "hero" exactly.

14:02.920 --> 14:05.580
It was just an accident.

14:05.580 --> 14:09.420
That was the bravest thing
anyone has ever done!

14:09.420 --> 14:11.750
You have my undying gratitude.

14:11.750 --> 14:14.210
Forever.

14:14.210 --> 14:16.960
You done saved
my little princess.

14:16.960 --> 14:19.250
Son, you're tops
in my book.

14:21.540 --> 14:22.920
Whoa!

14:22.920 --> 14:25.170
Three cheers for Lucky!

14:25.170 --> 14:29.580
Animals:
Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

14:33.000 --> 14:35.830
Man on TV:
Ah, the smell,

14:35.830 --> 14:38.120
the texture,
and the taste.

14:38.120 --> 14:40.120
Yes, nothing beats gravy

14:40.120 --> 14:42.380
made with artificial
monkey fat.

14:44.620 --> 14:48.460
Can't we watch something
besides The Gravy Channel?

14:48.460 --> 14:52.000
Uh-uh. It's my turn
to watch what I want:

14:52.000 --> 14:54.210
Giblets: The Movie.

14:55.120 --> 14:56.790
Move over, tubby.

14:56.790 --> 15:00.420
When Lucky's watching TV,
it's always his turn.

15:02.170 --> 15:03.500
Yeowch!

15:13.170 --> 15:17.250
So where's your ham honey,
hero boy

15:17.250 --> 15:20.290
She's not my honey,
so why don't you beat it, Mooch?

15:20.290 --> 15:23.080
Why don't you make me,
Lucky

15:31.460 --> 15:34.330
Leave my precious alone,
you brute.

15:34.330 --> 15:35.710
That's it!

15:35.710 --> 15:38.580
I'm not your precious,
I'm not your hero,

15:38.580 --> 15:41.210
and I don't need you
standing up for me all the time.

15:41.210 --> 15:43.960
I didn't even mean to save you.

15:43.960 --> 15:47.420
Oh, you're just being modest.

15:47.420 --> 15:49.620
So like a true hero.

15:49.620 --> 15:52.670
No, it was a freak accident.

15:52.670 --> 15:55.710
Well, like it or not,
I am grateful.

15:55.710 --> 15:57.080
Now come along.

15:57.080 --> 15:59.330
It's muddy time.

16:05.210 --> 16:06.790
Yoo-hoo!

16:06.790 --> 16:08.000
Lucky!

16:08.000 --> 16:11.290
Where's my barkin' hero
sandwich of love?

16:11.290 --> 16:13.330
Time for your mud bath!

16:15.500 --> 16:18.080
This is so degrading.

16:19.170 --> 16:22.250
Dumpling:
Where is my big,
strong mud puppy?

16:29.120 --> 16:31.460
There you are!

16:31.460 --> 16:34.080
Shh! Don't let her find me!

16:34.080 --> 16:36.960
Dumpling is using
her gratitude
to control your life.

16:36.960 --> 16:40.000
Being worshiped like a hero
is totally different

16:40.000 --> 16:41.330
from what I imagined.

16:41.330 --> 16:44.210
It's a nightmare.
My life isn't my own anymore.

16:44.210 --> 16:45.670
Face it, Lucky.

16:45.670 --> 16:47.960
As long as Dumpling thinks
she owes you one,

16:47.960 --> 16:49.040
you're stuck with her.

16:49.040 --> 16:51.500
Rolly, that's brilliant!

16:51.500 --> 16:53.540
All I have to do
is even the score!

16:53.540 --> 16:56.670
I'll just arrange
for Dumpling to save my life

16:56.670 --> 16:59.000
and then she'll have to
leave me alone!

17:11.420 --> 17:13.540
Okay, when I give the signal,

17:13.540 --> 17:16.540
Rolly opens the door,
and you two push the wagon

17:16.540 --> 17:18.080
out of the barn
toward me.

17:18.080 --> 17:20.960
Then, Dumpling will save
my life, and bingo!

17:20.960 --> 17:23.120
I'm a free dog again!

17:23.120 --> 17:25.830
Uh, what if Dumpling
doesn't save you?

17:25.830 --> 17:27.880
That's what the rope's for,

17:27.880 --> 17:30.210
to stop the wagon
if anything goes wrong.

17:31.250 --> 17:32.500
Here she comes.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.040
Hi, Dumpling.

17:36.040 --> 17:37.170
Nice day, huh?

17:37.170 --> 17:39.920
It certainly is, snookums.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.250
Oh, look.

17:42.250 --> 17:45.120
Dumpling, do my eyes deceive me?

17:45.120 --> 17:48.710
An out-of-control wagon
headed our way!

17:50.460 --> 17:51.790
What?

17:51.790 --> 17:53.670
come on, Dumpling.
Save me.

17:59.040 --> 18:01.040
Come on,
I know you can do it.

18:06.120 --> 18:07.330
Come on, Dumpling!

18:23.540 --> 18:26.460
You saved my life again.

18:26.460 --> 18:29.580
Now I know how deep
your true feelings are.

18:30.830 --> 18:33.750
I should've let
the wagon hit me.

18:37.420 --> 18:39.620
Lucky:
This is war!

18:39.620 --> 18:42.000
Dumpling's gonna
save my life,

18:42.000 --> 18:46.040
and this time,
even she's not gonna
mess it up.

18:46.040 --> 18:48.580
Lucky, I'm sensing
hostility here.

18:48.580 --> 18:51.080
You should open up
a can of humility

18:51.080 --> 18:53.330
and spread it on your issues.

18:53.330 --> 18:55.830
I'm gonna take
Dumpling on a picnic.

18:55.830 --> 18:58.880
Rolly, I want you to
put on this disguise.

18:58.880 --> 19:01.250
When you jump out
and scare us,
she'll save me.

19:01.250 --> 19:04.500
So he's disguised
as ladies accessories?

19:04.500 --> 19:07.790
Not accessories,
an alligator.

19:15.000 --> 19:18.540
I'm so glad
my little pupkin's decided

19:18.540 --> 19:20.500
to take me out
for a picnic.

19:20.500 --> 19:23.000
There!
That's what we need:

19:23.000 --> 19:25.380
flowers for a centerpiece!

19:30.000 --> 19:34.040
I sure hope
Dumpling rescues Lucky
from me fast.

19:34.040 --> 19:36.920
Alligator skin
just doesn't breathe.

19:39.710 --> 19:41.290
Oh no, I'm stuck.

19:41.290 --> 19:43.380
This is one little piggy

19:43.380 --> 19:45.960
who won't play along
with Lucky's game.

19:45.960 --> 19:49.920
It's nice that
we're finally alone.

19:49.920 --> 19:53.210
Hopefully not for long.

19:57.710 --> 20:00.080
There you are.
Great costume.

20:00.080 --> 20:02.420
Now come at me
like you're gonna eat me.

20:04.670 --> 20:07.620
This is too easy.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.080
You're not Rolly.

20:13.080 --> 20:18.460
You're S-- S-- Steven
the alligator!

20:18.460 --> 20:23.170
Nice try, guys, but that is
the stupidest costume
I have ever seen.

20:24.170 --> 20:27.420
Get! Me! Out!

20:27.420 --> 20:29.210
Yeah, right.

20:29.210 --> 20:31.120
Give me a break.

20:39.330 --> 20:40.830
Run, Dumpling!

20:40.830 --> 20:43.460
How cute,
you're savin' me again.

20:44.960 --> 20:47.380
-Now you've gone too far!

20:48.620 --> 20:51.790
You can dress up like a lizard,
you can even scare me,

20:51.790 --> 20:52.960
but nobody...

20:57.830 --> 21:01.380
nobody messes with my lunch.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.750
Grr!

21:06.750 --> 21:08.460
That's okay, Rolly.

21:08.460 --> 21:11.580
Dumpling just saved me
from a real alligator.

21:11.580 --> 21:13.920
Your services won't be needed.

21:13.920 --> 21:17.880
But I worked so hard
on my costume.

21:17.880 --> 21:20.710
That was
a real alligator?

21:20.710 --> 21:23.210
Oh, I could have been
eaten alive!

21:23.210 --> 21:25.290
Why didn't you save me?

21:25.290 --> 21:27.830
Because you saved me.

21:27.830 --> 21:29.000
I did?

21:29.000 --> 21:31.670
But-- but-- but
I didn't mean to save you.

21:31.670 --> 21:33.790
It just--
it doesn't count.

21:33.790 --> 21:35.750
Sorry, like it or not,

21:35.750 --> 21:37.620
we're even.

21:37.620 --> 21:40.710
I'm not anybody's hero!

21:40.710 --> 21:42.540
What a relief.

21:42.540 --> 21:44.000
Oh, come on,

21:44.000 --> 21:46.290
best two out of three?

21:49.170 --> 21:51.380
Don't. Move.

21:52.460 --> 21:53.540
Oh!

21:53.540 --> 21:56.500
Rolly, you saved my life.

21:56.500 --> 21:59.620
I am indebted
to you forever.

21:59.620 --> 22:02.080
I just remembered,

22:02.080 --> 22:04.080
I gotta get
my distemper shot.

22:04.080 --> 22:05.080
Outta here!
