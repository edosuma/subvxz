00:19.200 --> 00:21.308
To lose
an 18-year-old brother.

00:21.311 --> 00:24.542
He didn't get a chance to graduate
from high school. It was a blow.

00:24.614 --> 00:27.811
It destroyed me.
It made me feel like-

00:27.884 --> 00:30.250
I was afraid
to love anybody.

00:30.320 --> 00:34.620
I was really afraid
to let people get close to me.

00:34.691 --> 00:37.819
I felt
if I loved somebody,

00:37.894 --> 00:40.556
deeply, you know,
like I do my family,

00:40.630 --> 00:42.996
they would be taken away.

01:25.275 --> 01:27.209
I said, "Where'd you learn
to do that?"

01:27.277 --> 01:29.973
She said, "Practicing on
an old flame since I was 16."

01:32.249 --> 01:36.982
Look at this guy here. He's lookin' at
me and beatin' his meat. I like that.

01:37.053 --> 01:41.649
There she is. Right?
Miss America, 1912.

01:41.725 --> 01:44.558
Ina!
Let's hear it for Ina.

01:44.628 --> 01:46.687
Comes here every night,
huh, sweetie?

01:46.763 --> 01:49.391
Right.
Let me have a kiss.

01:49.466 --> 01:52.162
Bring out the broads!

01:52.235 --> 01:54.169
Let me at him!
Let me at him!

01:54.237 --> 01:56.228
Somebody throw a net
over this broad.

01:56.306 --> 01:58.206
Did you see him kiss
that fat fucker?

01:58.275 --> 02:00.368
Steve.
I'll always know him as 18.

02:00.443 --> 02:02.206
He, uh-

02:02.279 --> 02:07.410
He was killed by a drunk driver just
a month before he was to graduate.

02:07.484 --> 02:09.418
And-

02:09.485 --> 02:12.478
It's hard when you have
two policemen come in and say,

02:12.555 --> 02:14.819
"Your daughter's dead. "

02:14.891 --> 02:18.258
I op- I opened the door
and I saw 'em standing there,

02:18.328 --> 02:20.762
and I said,
"Mandy's dead, isn't she?"

02:20.830 --> 02:22.730
A mom knows.

02:38.915 --> 02:42.146
All right!

02:42.218 --> 02:45.210
Freddy, he's comin' over here.
You better slide in... a lot.

02:45.288 --> 02:48.587
- He needs half a booth.
- Sunny. How ya doin', Sunny? Everything good?

02:50.627 --> 02:52.561
How 'bout that?
How'd you like to spank it?

02:52.629 --> 02:55.189
- Nice!
- Oh, yeah! But softly.

02:55.265 --> 02:58.257
- Sunny, you had to spank that, right?
- Nice.

02:58.335 --> 03:01.031
My wife,
you know Joan.

03:01.104 --> 03:04.733
We got a step-down living room.
It's like two steps down.

03:04.808 --> 03:07.436
So the bitch don't wanna walk.
She wants me to raise it.

03:07.510 --> 03:09.740
She don't wanna walk down
two steps.

03:09.813 --> 03:12.441
I still have to get over that.
It's something that...

03:12.515 --> 03:16.508
- you have to work with on a daily basis.
- it's not gonna come back.

03:16.586 --> 03:21.046
It's just something of- It's yours.
It's like your body lost...

03:21.124 --> 03:23.854
something inside,
something of yourself.

03:23.927 --> 03:26.623
I miss me.

03:26.696 --> 03:30.132
I miss... me.

03:30.200 --> 03:33.294
It's over five years now,
and...

03:33.370 --> 03:37.830
I look in the mirror,
"Where's Bobby?"

03:37.907 --> 03:39.465
I don't know.

03:39.542 --> 03:42.807
My family drives me
up the fuckin' wall.

03:42.879 --> 03:47.543
I mean, they, I guess they still,
they still think I'm me, Bobby.

03:47.617 --> 03:52.020
But... they joke about it.

03:52.088 --> 03:56.991
They call me...
sibling number three, all right?

03:57.060 --> 04:02.088
And... it's like a nickname
for Bobby depressed.

04:02.165 --> 04:04.725
It was my older brother Danny
that we lost.

04:04.801 --> 04:09.704
And...

04:09.773 --> 04:13.641
he was sibling number one.

04:14.677 --> 04:16.644
And...

04:18.248 --> 04:21.081
they, th-they didn't-

04:21.151 --> 04:23.711
Did they forget?
I don't know.

04:26.823 --> 04:28.381
I'm gone!

04:28.458 --> 04:30.392
And-

04:32.362 --> 04:34.387
I miss me.

04:37.233 --> 04:39.428
So...

04:39.502 --> 04:42.266
that's it.

04:45.708 --> 04:49.200
Who's runnin'
this fuckin' show?

05:20.710 --> 05:24.146
- You oughta go.
- What?

05:24.214 --> 05:26.148
Go.

05:26.216 --> 05:29.811
- You should go.
- Okay, yeah. I'm gonna go.

05:31.120 --> 05:35.580
Um... Freddy,
can I use your shower?

05:35.658 --> 05:37.649
Help yourself.

06:41.791 --> 06:44.089
# Woke up this mornin' #

06:44.160 --> 06:47.061
# There was a chill in the air #

06:50.300 --> 06:55.738
# Went into the kitchen
My cigarettes were lyin' there #

06:59.576 --> 07:04.536
# Jacket hung on the chair
the way I left it last night #

07:08.918 --> 07:14.220
# Everything was in place
Everything seemed all right #

07:16.626 --> 07:19.117
# But you were missin' #

07:21.598 --> 07:24.396
# Missing #

07:30.607 --> 07:33.542
# Missing #

07:36.179 --> 07:41.674
# Last night I dreamed
the sky went black #

07:45.321 --> 07:49.951
# You were drifting down
Couldn't get back #

07:54.497 --> 07:59.366
# Lost in trouble
so far from home #

08:03.373 --> 08:08.811
# I reached for you
My arms were like stone #

08:10.346 --> 08:13.509
# Woke and I'm missin' you #

08:16.152 --> 08:18.313
# Missin' you #

08:25.061 --> 08:27.962
# Missing #

08:28.998 --> 08:30.932
# Oh #

08:38.573 --> 08:42.032
# Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah ##

09:13.509 --> 09:16.171
Jefferey.

09:16.245 --> 09:20.204
It's five after 10:00. I got a window
display of gray felt. What's goin' on?

09:20.283 --> 09:23.218
Mr. Gale, you took all the vault keys
home last night.

09:23.286 --> 09:26.744
- For fuck sakes.
- I think...

09:26.823 --> 09:29.485
it would be wonderful to put emerald
pieces in front of the diamonds.

09:29.559 --> 09:34.826
I trust your preference
in stones, Jefferey, but...

09:34.897 --> 09:36.956
I'm very busy,
you know what I mean?

09:37.033 --> 09:39.092
All the time,
I'm very busy.

09:39.168 --> 09:42.399
So, uh, think ahead
a little bit.

09:42.472 --> 09:45.066
I'm walkin' out the door,
you're closin' up,

09:45.141 --> 09:47.666
you don't have the vault keys
in your pocket, stop me.

09:47.744 --> 09:49.268
Yes, sir.

09:49.345 --> 09:51.813
Emeralds in the front.
Wonderful.

12:25.635 --> 12:28.968
What's so funny?

12:33.142 --> 12:35.303
What are you
laughing at?

12:35.378 --> 12:37.846
Ah, it's been
six fucking years!

12:37.914 --> 12:40.678
I mean, I have my son here.
Can't I be happy?

12:40.750 --> 12:43.810
I've never heard
that word out of your mouth.

12:43.886 --> 12:46.480
And in front of John.

12:46.555 --> 12:49.991
Ma!
I've been in prison.

12:50.059 --> 12:54.655
Don't make excuses for him. Listen, do
you still have that little TV I sent you?

12:54.730 --> 12:57.358
- Yeah. It's in the box.
- Oh, good, because...

12:57.433 --> 13:00.596
I'm cleaning out the trailer for you
if you want some privacy.

13:00.670 --> 13:02.831
Oh, yeah.
That'd be great.

13:02.905 --> 13:06.363
- Or you could stay in your own room.
- No, no, no. Trailer's great.

13:13.749 --> 13:16.547
Because that's
a good fucking TV.

13:16.619 --> 13:18.348
Oh, my God!

14:16.212 --> 14:19.511
Freddy.
How's it goin'?

14:22.952 --> 14:25.944
Roger.
Good to see you.

14:26.022 --> 14:28.115
Come in.

14:33.963 --> 14:37.194
Uh, can I get you
something to drink?

14:37.266 --> 14:40.565
- Phil, yeah. Let me call you back in five minutes.
- No, I'm fine.

14:40.636 --> 14:43.628
All right. Thank you.
I'm sorry?

14:43.706 --> 14:46.834
Uh, no, thank you.

14:50.846 --> 14:53.212
Emily really loved
this thing.

14:55.251 --> 14:59.244
We used to keep it
over there on the counter.

15:02.992 --> 15:06.792
Stretch her whole body out
trying to reach it.

15:06.862 --> 15:09.922
Last joint
on her little finger.

15:19.875 --> 15:21.809
What?

15:21.877 --> 15:24.209
N- Nothin'.

15:25.481 --> 15:28.382
Come in.
Sit down, Freddy.

15:38.861 --> 15:41.557
Boy. Tch.

15:41.630 --> 15:46.226
You really look like a natural family.
You could be their father.

15:48.304 --> 15:51.865
Thank you, Freddy.

15:51.941 --> 15:55.570
Spectacular looking family,
really.

15:59.048 --> 16:03.815
Um, what can I, uh,
do for you?

16:06.989 --> 16:09.253
I really came to see Mary.

16:09.325 --> 16:14.991
Oh. Well, I don't mean to be
nosy, Freddy, but what about?

16:15.064 --> 16:18.830
Well, I'd really rather
talk to Mary about that.

16:21.170 --> 16:22.762
Well-

16:24.473 --> 16:26.441
Well, well, well.

16:31.013 --> 16:35.575
- Um, you sure I can't get you something to drink?
- No, I'm fine.

16:38.254 --> 16:40.279
- Anyway, I think they're here.
- Oh, yeah.

16:43.025 --> 16:45.926
Hold on, guys.

16:46.595 --> 16:48.620
Hold on.

16:48.697 --> 16:50.722
- Hi, Dad!
- Hi, guys.

16:50.799 --> 16:53.199
- Hi, Freddy.
- Hi, darling.

16:53.269 --> 16:56.329
- We've got a visitor.
- Come on, Dad.

17:01.477 --> 17:03.445
Well...

17:06.348 --> 17:08.680
look at this.

17:10.586 --> 17:14.488
My own kids
call me Freddy.

17:18.160 --> 17:22.324
- You look wonderful.
- Wonderful, I think, would be pushing it.

17:22.397 --> 17:25.992
No, you do.
You look wonderful.

17:26.902 --> 17:28.836
Thank you.

17:30.372 --> 17:35.207
So, how's business?

17:35.277 --> 17:37.837
So-so.

17:37.913 --> 17:40.711
You know, it's a little jewelry store.
What can I say?

17:40.783 --> 17:43.479
It's business.

17:43.552 --> 17:46.487
What about you?
You still doin' the real estate?

17:46.555 --> 17:49.285
Well, it's a tough market
right now.

17:49.358 --> 17:52.953
I'm still representing
some properties.

17:53.028 --> 17:58.125
But Roger's been doing so well, I've been able
to back off some. Spend more time with the kids.

17:59.235 --> 18:02.170
Oh, well, wonderful.

18:02.238 --> 18:07.175
That's, uh, yeah-
That's, uh, really wonderful.

18:07.243 --> 18:09.939
Um-

18:10.012 --> 18:11.980
Um...

18:13.682 --> 18:16.708
Mary, there's, uh, something
that you should know.

18:16.785 --> 18:21.654
It's the reason
I came here.

18:21.724 --> 18:24.557
- Freddy-
- I've got something I wanna tell you.

18:24.627 --> 18:27.960
You made me a promise.
I hope you're gonna keep it.

18:29.365 --> 18:34.166
Two things:
I made you a promise. That's one.

18:34.236 --> 18:38.696
And I have great news.
That's two.

18:38.774 --> 18:40.833
Now, you gonna let me speak
or not?

18:43.579 --> 18:46.013
I'm sorry.
What's your great news?

18:48.784 --> 18:51.753
It's really great news.
I mean, spectacular news.

18:51.820 --> 18:56.382
- I'm tellin' ya. You wanna
hear it or not? - Mm-hmm.

18:56.458 --> 18:58.858
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

18:58.927 --> 19:00.519
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

19:03.332 --> 19:05.266
He's out.

19:05.334 --> 19:09.270
John Booth is out.

19:09.338 --> 19:11.272
I'm gonna kill him.

19:11.340 --> 19:13.205
Get out of here, Freddy.

19:13.275 --> 19:16.676
I'm not goin' anywhere until I see you
courageous enough to tell the truth.

19:16.745 --> 19:19.270
The truth?
What truth, Freddy?

19:19.348 --> 19:22.010
- You promised you wouldn't.
- Wouldn't? Wouldn't what, Mary?

19:22.084 --> 19:25.349
- Mention our daughter? Why? Because you'd blackmail me?
- Blackmail?

19:25.421 --> 19:28.754
If I ever, ever want to speak
to the mother of my children,

19:28.824 --> 19:30.849
I must never mention
my daughter!

19:30.926 --> 19:34.191
- Get out of our house!
- This is my house.

19:34.263 --> 19:37.596
By any natural law,
this is my house!

19:37.666 --> 19:41.193
If my children live here,
my children,

19:41.270 --> 19:45.263
then who's to say that I can't come here
to see 'em any fuckin' time I want to?

19:45.341 --> 19:48.435
- You had to do it, huh?
- Nobody's talkin' to you!

19:48.510 --> 19:51.104
- You want me to call the police?
- Call whoever the fuck you want.

19:51.180 --> 19:54.343
Where do you get off calling them your children?
You haven't been a father to those kids.

19:54.416 --> 19:57.977
- You stopped with our daughter.
- Emily is her name.

19:58.053 --> 20:01.420
Yes, Emily. Emily!
And she is dead.

20:01.490 --> 20:04.789
But I owe those two little boys
up there all the love I've got.

20:04.860 --> 20:08.694
And it kills you that I can
give it to them and that you can't!

20:11.433 --> 20:14.527
Freddy, I want you
to leave our home-

20:14.603 --> 20:18.039
- Tell the truth, Mary. You want me to kill John Booth!
- Let go of him!

20:18.107 --> 20:22.635
That's my job in life, and your job is
to go on as though nothing happened!

20:22.711 --> 20:25.646
- Let go of him!
- Freddy!

20:25.714 --> 20:29.172
Freddy, why don't you let me go?
I'll make us some coffee.

20:29.251 --> 20:32.049
Come on.

20:32.121 --> 20:35.147
Coffee. Good.

20:35.224 --> 20:37.385
I'd like some coffee.

20:37.459 --> 20:42.419
Why don't we all just sit down, have
some coffee and talk about this civilly?

20:42.498 --> 20:45.262
Come on.

20:45.334 --> 20:48.929
You know what?

20:52.307 --> 20:54.867
I don't want any coffee.
I-

20:57.079 --> 20:59.877
I don't like coffee at all.
It makes my heart-

20:59.948 --> 21:03.247
- You just said you wanted coffee.
- No.

21:03.318 --> 21:05.183
You sure?

21:05.254 --> 21:10.453
Yes. Uh... no.

21:10.526 --> 21:12.756
I'm gonna go.

21:13.862 --> 21:16.922
I feel good.

21:19.902 --> 21:24.862
- He just showed up at the door.
I didn't- - Jesus, God, Roger.

21:24.940 --> 21:27.875
I just want to say this.

21:27.943 --> 21:30.741
I've done a lot of things
for you, you know.

21:30.813 --> 21:33.043
A lot of things.

21:33.115 --> 21:37.575
And I think it's cheap of you that you
won't hear me out on things. I really do.

21:37.653 --> 21:41.089
- Mary's just upset.
- Excuse me, but I am not upset.

21:41.156 --> 21:45.354
If you think I'm gonna keep score on who's
done what to who, you're very fucking wrong!

21:45.427 --> 21:47.918
And if you think that's cheap,
then fuck you!

21:47.996 --> 21:52.228
I don't know if you're serious about
killing this man or not, but I do know this.

21:52.301 --> 21:54.599
It has nothing to do
with our daughter.

21:54.670 --> 21:57.366
Our little girl is gone, Freddy,
and she's not coming back...

21:57.439 --> 22:00.499
no matter what you do!

22:00.576 --> 22:04.603
You've never even been to the cemetery,
Freddy. You've never even been to Emily's grave.

22:04.680 --> 22:06.807
Why?

22:06.882 --> 22:11.649
Because I didn't go to
your little party? Your funeral?

22:11.720 --> 22:15.816
I went on my own time,
Mary... in private.

22:15.891 --> 22:18.485
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

22:18.560 --> 22:22.052
Then you're a braver man
than I thought.

22:22.130 --> 22:24.655
What's the inscription
on the stone, Freddy?

22:26.168 --> 22:28.432
What color is it?

22:28.504 --> 22:31.302
Is it on a hill?
Is it under a tree?

22:31.373 --> 22:34.968
Does it lay flat or does it
stick up out of the ground?

22:41.617 --> 22:44.484
That's what I thought.

22:46.588 --> 22:50.752
Roger, man to man,

22:50.826 --> 22:53.192
when you two read
in the newspaper...

22:53.262 --> 22:56.356
that John Booth
has been shot dead,

22:56.431 --> 23:01.869
I want you to look into her face and
tell me if you don't see pride and relief.

23:01.937 --> 23:05.532
Pride and relief,
Mary.

24:07.402 --> 24:09.370
So, listen to me.

24:09.438 --> 24:11.906
I'm comin' out of the bathroom,
right?

24:11.974 --> 24:14.909
And these two Orientals,
they're arguin', they're hollerin'.

24:14.977 --> 24:17.775
They're screamin'
at one another, and all in Japanese.

24:17.846 --> 24:19.575
So, I told 'em.

24:19.648 --> 24:24.847
I said, "Hey, you're in
America now. Speak Spanish. "

24:27.289 --> 24:31.726
- Geez, you fucking guys.
Have a miserable evening.

24:31.793 --> 24:35.126
What was he doin' in the mens' room?

24:35.197 --> 24:38.792
Hey, Freddy. Freddy.
What?

24:38.867 --> 24:40.801
Hey, Freddy, you with us?

24:40.869 --> 24:44.066
I think we hypnotized him.
Freddy!

24:45.307 --> 24:48.208
- Yeah?
- He's on the rag.

24:51.847 --> 24:56.580
Did any of you guys ever have
a sound build up in your head...

24:56.652 --> 24:59.485
over a period of days?

24:59.554 --> 25:02.079
Like a vacuum cleaner?

25:02.157 --> 25:06.150
That the last time
you had an original thought,

25:06.228 --> 25:09.026
you got cocky
and rode on it?

25:09.097 --> 25:12.624
- Rode what?
- Rode on the thought.

25:13.969 --> 25:16.130
Enjoyed it...

25:17.572 --> 25:22.600
'til you started hearin' that
vacuum cleaner in your brain.

25:22.678 --> 25:27.172
- But you don't mean tonight.
- No. He means some other night.

25:27.249 --> 25:29.945
Take my advice, Freddy.

25:30.018 --> 25:32.919
Get yourself a "youngie" and go
on one of them Laguna weekends.

25:44.833 --> 25:47.529
I gotta take off.
I'll see you guys later.

25:47.602 --> 25:50.366
Freddy, where you goin'?
It's only 11:00.

25:50.439 --> 25:52.202
Oh, man.

25:52.274 --> 25:54.208
Commitments.

25:54.276 --> 25:58.303
He's gonna go turn off the fuckin'
vacuum cleaner!

27:54.996 --> 27:57.521
Pride and relief, Mary.

28:19.054 --> 28:20.988
Goddamn it!

28:21.056 --> 28:23.923
Goddamn it!

28:23.992 --> 28:27.860
Fuckin'-
Fuckin' clip is empty.

28:27.929 --> 28:31.592
This fuckin' gun ain't got
no fuckin' clip. You cock.

28:36.638 --> 28:39.106
All right
I get a cigarette?

28:42.177 --> 28:44.111
All right.

28:56.925 --> 28:58.893
You know-

29:01.796 --> 29:04.629
Would you mind closin' the door?
I don't want to wake my parents.

29:12.007 --> 29:14.942
Might fuckin' wake
his fuckin' parents.

29:25.954 --> 29:27.922
When the thing happened,

29:31.960 --> 29:34.554
I wanted to be dead.

29:37.899 --> 29:42.427
But there wasn't-
You know.

29:42.504 --> 29:45.837
I didn't want
your forgiveness.

29:45.907 --> 29:50.003
I didn't think I deserved it.
And I don't think I do.

29:53.481 --> 29:55.449
But...

30:04.559 --> 30:06.527
I guess you, uh...

30:08.063 --> 30:11.055
you've been waitin' for this day
for a long time.

30:11.132 --> 30:13.896
It's all right.
Sit down.

30:18.440 --> 30:20.374
Sit down.

30:21.910 --> 30:25.073
I know it's been
a long wait.

30:25.146 --> 30:28.274
But I'm not goin' anywhere.

30:31.152 --> 30:34.986
I'm not callin' any cops.

30:35.056 --> 30:39.322
I'll just be here,
trying to get on with things.

30:47.869 --> 30:50.030
Would you maybe,
you know-

30:53.208 --> 30:56.939
Would you take
a couple days...

30:57.012 --> 31:00.038
and maybe think about
not takin' my life?

31:00.115 --> 31:03.084
Look.

31:03.151 --> 31:07.884
I'm a jeweler.
I got a jewelry store.

31:07.956 --> 31:12.484
That's all I got.
That's it. That's what I am.

31:12.560 --> 31:15.358
- Understand what I'm talkin' about?
- I think I do.

31:15.430 --> 31:19.890
Shut up! Because you don't.
You don't understand. You don't!

31:22.303 --> 31:24.294
All right.

31:40.522 --> 31:44.219
I'm gonna give you
three days.

31:44.292 --> 31:46.351
Three days.

31:50.799 --> 31:53.734
Then maybe I'll remember
the fuckin' clip for this gun.

31:53.802 --> 31:55.429
Son of a bitch!

32:01.709 --> 32:05.372
And up. Let's go!

32:05.447 --> 32:08.439
We're warming up.
Get that blood flowing.

32:08.516 --> 32:11.815
Again.
Now tuck your arms.

32:11.886 --> 32:15.014
Front and back.
And step.

32:25.433 --> 32:28.596
I don't want another ring.
I want this ring in a size seven.

32:28.670 --> 32:30.661
Don't you understand?

32:30.738 --> 32:34.868
I was a seven on Tuesday and I'm
a seven today. This is not a seven.

32:34.943 --> 32:36.968
You have a swollen
finger one day, not the next.

32:37.045 --> 32:39.775
I want to speak to the owner.
It's not a seven.

32:39.848 --> 32:43.045
It's maybe a six,
a six and a half.

32:43.118 --> 32:46.747
- I sized your finger two times.
- I wanted to wear this ring tonight.

32:46.821 --> 32:49.187
I have a very important
engagement tonight.

32:49.257 --> 32:51.725
No, I don't want another ring.
I want this ring...

32:51.793 --> 32:54.284
- in a size seven like I ordered it.
- May I help you, ma'am?

32:54.362 --> 32:58.458
- Are you the owner?
- Yes, I would be the proprietor in question.

32:58.533 --> 33:03.766
Thank God. I told this Jap faggot
I ordered this ring size seven.

33:03.838 --> 33:06.306
My ring size has always been a seven.
This is not a seven.

33:06.374 --> 33:09.207
- It won't even fit on my hand.
- May I see the ring, please?

33:09.277 --> 33:12.804
Yeah. It won't fit on my finger,
my hand. It won't fit anything.

33:12.881 --> 33:16.044
It's a six and a half.
Six and three-quarters maybe.

33:19.154 --> 33:22.021
Does that look like a
six fuckin' and a half to you?

33:23.791 --> 33:26.191
Ahh.

33:26.261 --> 33:28.855
You were right.
You're a perfect seven.

33:28.930 --> 33:31.990
A perfect fucking seven.

33:51.753 --> 33:55.780
Do you know where
this bus turns around?

33:59.394 --> 34:01.692
Pardon?

34:01.763 --> 34:05.324
Does this bus stay
in Glendale?

34:09.704 --> 34:12.036
I don't know.

34:13.608 --> 34:17.840
Does it turn around
and come back to Marge Street?

34:17.911 --> 34:19.902
I don't know.

34:23.418 --> 34:27.286
- Do you come back to Marge Street?
- No.

34:31.693 --> 34:35.185
My sister has a car.

34:35.263 --> 34:38.027
A Valiant.

34:40.568 --> 34:44.629
- Did you ever get to ride in a Valiant?
- No.

34:44.706 --> 34:48.574
My sister has
a green Valiant.

34:54.349 --> 34:58.251
I ride the bus
all day long.

35:01.522 --> 35:04.218
I have
a disability card...

35:04.292 --> 35:06.624
so I don't have to pay.

35:45.099 --> 35:47.033
Daddy!

36:16.464 --> 36:18.398
Hello.
Mary Manning.

36:19.467 --> 36:22.265
Hello?

36:29.911 --> 36:34.143
- Hey, what's in the news?
- Hey! Get in the car.

36:34.215 --> 36:37.116
Okay, we're late.

36:37.185 --> 36:39.119
- But you got the job.
- Yeah.

36:39.187 --> 36:41.155
- You start at 6:00 in the morning.
- Oh, man.

36:41.222 --> 36:43.656
It's a boat.
It's a good job.

36:43.725 --> 36:47.252
Second, there's a bunch of people
at my house. It's a party for you.

36:47.328 --> 36:49.888
- A party?
- Girls.

36:49.964 --> 36:53.525
- Wow.
- But we're not goin' anywhere until-

36:53.601 --> 36:55.535
- In the joint,
- Yeah?

36:55.603 --> 36:58.731
did you get
butt-fucked?

36:58.806 --> 37:01.206
It only hurts
the first time.

37:01.275 --> 37:02.572
I know.

37:04.746 --> 37:09.376
# I was born a cowboy
And a cowboy I will die #

37:09.450 --> 37:13.318
# I was born a cowboy
And I'll die #

37:13.388 --> 37:17.449
# I was born a cowboy
And a cowboy I will die #

37:17.525 --> 37:21.427
- # I was born a cowboy
And I'll die # - Yee-hoo!

37:21.496 --> 37:25.432
# I will die before my time
But then my kind always do #

37:25.500 --> 37:30.733
# I will die before my time
I will die ##

37:30.805 --> 37:35.037
- Take your hands out
of your pockets. Let's hear it.

37:35.109 --> 37:38.977
That's Verna. Come on, now.
Let's open up your sphincter...

37:39.046 --> 37:41.241
and let the sunlight in.
Verna!

37:41.315 --> 37:43.249
Oh, Verna,
come on, girl.

37:43.317 --> 37:45.842
You better hurry up.
We're gonna be late. Nicky Blair's!

37:45.920 --> 37:47.911
- I didn't know. Is she goin'?
- Of course she's goin'.

37:51.125 --> 37:53.821
I thought it was just
gonna be you and me. Dinner?

37:53.895 --> 37:56.955
Well, we can't do it
in a restaurant, Verna.

37:57.031 --> 38:00.262
What difference does it make?
Geez.

38:00.334 --> 38:02.962
You wanna go or not?
Come on. Huh?

38:03.037 --> 38:06.495
Whoever wants to go, come on,
let's go. I'll wait in the car.

38:06.574 --> 38:09.338
Hey!

38:09.410 --> 38:12.345
The train's
a- movin' on.

38:12.413 --> 38:15.177
Get your stuff.
Get your stuff. Let's go.

38:15.249 --> 38:19.379
- Yeah, let's go. Let's have fun.
Let's, ha-ha, party, huh? - Verna?

38:19.454 --> 38:22.184
And I'm talking to you before about
compassion, how you have compassion...

38:22.256 --> 38:26.386
for people, and you decide every day
who deserves compassion and who doesn't.

38:26.461 --> 38:28.395
That's your spirituality.

38:28.463 --> 38:31.990
If somebody is black and dying on the
street, then they deserve compassion.

38:32.066 --> 38:35.058
And if somebody is rich and their sister
dies, they get a little bit.

38:35.136 --> 38:38.503
But if somebody is rich and they
have a bad day, forget it.

38:38.573 --> 38:43.476
They don't deserve a bit of compassion.
You haven't lived that person's life.

38:43.544 --> 38:47.139
But because they don't have any
identifiable things that deserve compassion,

38:47.215 --> 38:49.149
you don't give it to them.

38:49.217 --> 38:53.051
Not once have I seen you
do that.

38:53.120 --> 38:55.680
Oh, I make him feel bad.
Let me tell a joke.

38:55.756 --> 38:57.587
Okay. Well-

39:01.562 --> 39:05.054
Nine is taken.
I'll give him 22. Okay?

39:05.132 --> 39:07.760
- Hello, Mr. Gale. Good to see you.
- Nick, how are you tonight?

39:07.835 --> 39:09.496
You look so good.
Hello, ladies.

39:09.570 --> 39:12.903
Mr. Gale, listen. I've got
a great, great, great booth for you.

39:12.974 --> 39:15.340
It's a half a booth, but we're
gonna get the other half-

39:15.409 --> 39:17.775
- Here. Take their coats quickly.
- Uh, half a booth?

39:17.845 --> 39:21.178
Yes. But don't worry. We're gonna get
the other booth in about 15 minutes.

39:21.249 --> 39:23.240
- At nine, you mean.
- It's right by the bar. I couldn't get that one.

39:23.317 --> 39:26.309
- Is it nine?
- No, no. Don't worry about nine. Here, take this.

39:26.387 --> 39:28.116
Come on, girls.
Look how beautiful they are.

39:28.189 --> 39:30.919
- You're always with
pretty girls, Mr. Gale.

39:30.992 --> 39:34.018
# Can't last #

39:34.095 --> 39:38.361
# Any time
Any place #

39:38.432 --> 39:43.426
This- This is, uh,
a nice table, huh?

39:43.504 --> 39:46.302
- It's fine. Fine.
- I guess.

39:46.374 --> 39:49.969
We can see the bar really good.

39:50.044 --> 39:53.411
Forgive me. I have this painting.
Jojo did this painting.

39:53.481 --> 39:55.949
After years of bullshit,

39:56.017 --> 39:59.578
I'm sorry, finally reaches a point
where she does this incredible work.

39:59.654 --> 40:01.884
She smears herself with paint,
she rolls herself around...

40:01.956 --> 40:04.220
on a,
on a piece of canvass-

40:04.292 --> 40:05.953
- Paper.
- Paper.

40:06.027 --> 40:09.292
You were trying
to represent God.

40:09.363 --> 40:14.130
Right? Okay.
Uh, just allow me this.

40:14.201 --> 40:17.466
But what she ends up with
is an image of herself.

40:17.538 --> 40:19.904
She looks for God
and she finds,

40:19.974 --> 40:22.875
she finds herself.

40:34.255 --> 40:37.418
Whoo!

40:37.491 --> 40:40.688
Ate all the clams
in the house, did you?

40:42.229 --> 40:44.720
Oh, don't torture
yourself, sweetheart.

40:44.799 --> 40:47.029
She wants to be your woman,
motherfucker.

40:47.101 --> 40:50.070
- Better watch your ass.
- Come on!

40:50.137 --> 40:52.071
Go easy now.

40:52.139 --> 40:55.404
You girls seem to be having
a good time. You must be a funny guy.

40:55.476 --> 40:57.410
I'm a riot.

40:57.478 --> 41:01.539
- Now get the fuck outta here.
- I didn't mean anything. I just stopped by, having fun.

41:01.616 --> 41:05.017
- Nothin' personal.
- Go have your fun somewhere else. Just get the fuck outta here.

41:05.086 --> 41:09.113
Relax. I don't mean any offense by this. I
just thought maybe you'd like extra help here.

41:09.190 --> 41:12.318
You got some pretty girls here.
Maybe you need some help.

41:12.393 --> 41:15.157
- I don't need no fuckin' help!
- Hey, hey, hey!

41:15.229 --> 41:17.163
Take it easy!
Hey, hey!

41:25.973 --> 41:29.739
Are we having fun now,
you motherfucker?

41:29.810 --> 41:31.971
# In my bowl
I ain't foolin' #

41:32.046 --> 41:34.947
# I want a little sugar #

41:35.016 --> 41:38.645
# In my bowl ##

41:38.719 --> 41:41.517
- You had to drag me into this?
- Not to put too fine a point on it, but...

41:41.589 --> 41:44.752
you know
something about confinement.

41:44.825 --> 41:48.921
- I think we all know something about confinement.
- Well, there's confinement...

41:48.996 --> 41:51.965
and there's...
confinement.

41:52.033 --> 41:53.933
I know what you mean.

41:54.001 --> 41:58.529
Yeah, at the risk of sounding like
I know what I'm talking about,

41:59.440 --> 42:03.399
I think freedom's overrated.

42:03.477 --> 42:06.844
What you're talking about.

42:06.914 --> 42:10.406
You know, if there isn't
something bigger than, uh,

42:10.484 --> 42:12.475
than freedom,

42:12.553 --> 42:15.545
then freedom
is just entertainment.

42:15.623 --> 42:17.113
Entertainment?

42:24.765 --> 42:28.997
- Like a central computer, you mean?
- We transmit downtown.

42:29.070 --> 42:32.198
- Everybody?
- Everybody that gets booked.

42:32.273 --> 42:35.106
- Murderers too?
- Especially murderers.

42:35.176 --> 42:39.237
- Ever do any murders?
- Not personally. Have you?

42:40.448 --> 42:42.382
# Ain't it funny to see #

42:42.450 --> 42:44.884
# How blind a man can be #

42:44.952 --> 42:48.547
# Ain't it funny
to look back on love #

42:49.724 --> 42:52.022
Hmm.

42:55.863 --> 42:58.331
You all right?

42:58.399 --> 43:01.698
Oh, yeah.
Yeah. I'm just-

43:04.872 --> 43:07.841
No, I'm f-
You know, fine.

43:09.877 --> 43:11.811
I'm John.

43:11.879 --> 43:14.404
I know.
I'm Jojo.

43:14.482 --> 43:18.919
- You know. You know about me?
- Peter told me.

43:18.986 --> 43:21.250
Mmm.

43:26.393 --> 43:29.021
The father of the, uh,

43:30.831 --> 43:33.857
the girl I killed,
he threatened to kill me last night.

43:35.202 --> 43:37.636
It was an accident,
right?

43:39.507 --> 43:42.203
Was he serious?
You, you- Serious?

43:42.276 --> 43:45.211
I think he was serious.

43:45.279 --> 43:47.747
I think he's a serious man.

43:50.117 --> 43:52.176
You're the only person
I've told.

43:53.254 --> 43:55.188
Why?

43:57.057 --> 43:59.048
Well, I-

44:00.895 --> 44:04.058
I think I thought
it would be romantic.

44:11.172 --> 44:14.073
Why would you
want to be romantic?

44:23.150 --> 44:25.880
How'd you get
that scar on your head?

44:25.953 --> 44:29.116
Banged my head
against the wall.

44:29.190 --> 44:32.626
- In jail?
- Uh-huh.

44:34.028 --> 44:36.861
You or somebody else?

44:38.332 --> 44:40.425
- You?
- Mm-hmm.

44:40.501 --> 44:42.765
You just couldn't stand jail?

44:42.837 --> 44:46.136
No. I just couldn't
stand me.

44:51.412 --> 44:56.873
Yeah, I was gonna call, but it got so
late, I didn't think you guys would be up.

44:56.951 --> 44:58.816
Of course we're up!

44:58.886 --> 45:01.320
You just got home.
We want to see you.

45:03.090 --> 45:06.059
I'm sorry.
It's just, uh-

45:06.126 --> 45:09.562
- I got the job.
- Ah, good.

45:09.630 --> 45:13.657
And Peter and his brother threw me
a coming-home party.

45:13.734 --> 45:15.725
The day
just kinda happened.

45:15.803 --> 45:20.069
- When do you start on the boat?
- Actually in a few hours.

45:20.140 --> 45:22.938
Why do you stay out so late
before you start a job?

45:23.010 --> 45:27.106
Your friends don't care
if you get any rest.

45:27.181 --> 45:32.050
Something hit me tonight.

45:32.119 --> 45:34.587
It was a strange night.

45:38.459 --> 45:40.893
You know, uh,

45:45.099 --> 45:48.068
I've done a horrible thing.

45:48.135 --> 45:50.933
And, uh,

45:51.005 --> 45:53.974
I'm always
gonna feel the guilt...

45:54.041 --> 45:56.168
and remorse.

45:57.344 --> 45:59.904
But...

46:01.248 --> 46:05.685
when you hear about
a thing like that,

46:05.753 --> 46:10.713
about someone who has
to carry a thing like that,

46:12.626 --> 46:16.221
when you're in it,
it's just, it's-

46:21.035 --> 46:24.368
It's very different...

46:24.438 --> 46:27.339
from what you might think.

46:30.077 --> 46:33.672
I'm not an unhappy person.

46:33.747 --> 46:38.650
I'm just-
I'm just-

46:38.719 --> 46:43.179
I'm someone who has caused
a lot of... unhappiness.

46:44.792 --> 46:48.023
And a person
who's caused death.

46:57.071 --> 47:01.030
I, uh,
I love you...

47:01.108 --> 47:04.737
both so much.

47:04.812 --> 47:09.408
Not just as my parents,
but...

47:09.483 --> 47:12.577
as two people who,

47:12.653 --> 47:17.215
who stood by
and kept giving...

47:19.593 --> 47:23.290
your love... to that person.

47:26.166 --> 47:28.134
That person...

47:30.170 --> 47:34.539
who has also caused you both
so much pain.

47:34.608 --> 47:39.545
You're our son.
Of course we love you.

47:39.613 --> 47:41.581
No matter what.

47:46.420 --> 47:49.753
Let's get this straight,
girl. Everyone gets paid by the hour.

47:49.823 --> 47:54.522
- Listen, I'll see you in a bit.
- Ah, Jefferey. Thank you. Here, hold this.

47:54.595 --> 47:57.063
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine, thank you.

47:57.131 --> 48:00.623
I'm, uh,
I'm fuckin' delighted.

48:02.302 --> 48:05.738
- Please. We can do a fashion show outside.
- Thank you.

48:05.806 --> 48:08.639
- Who is that, Jefferey?
- It's my boyfriend Gene.

48:08.709 --> 48:10.870
- Did you get the car?
- Yeah. The car's outside.

48:10.944 --> 48:13.970
- Let's get the fuck out of here. Okay. All right.
- Finally!

48:14.048 --> 48:17.381
- Are you okay?
- I'm just fuckin' great.

48:18.552 --> 48:21.885
- Thank you.
- I can't get this thing.

48:22.523 --> 48:25.185
- Where's the fuckin' car?
- Over there.

48:30.631 --> 48:34.499
# I might
just change my mind #

48:34.568 --> 48:38.470
# Sometimes
you can never tell #

48:40.007 --> 48:44.569
# Where a story
will unwind #

48:44.645 --> 48:48.274
# How deep is
a shallow well #

48:49.850 --> 48:54.685
# Sometimes
you would never guess #

48:54.755 --> 48:57.690
# Who's all talk
and who just might #

48:59.560 --> 49:04.395
# Find a way
or lose themselves #

49:10.500 --> 49:12.695
- Same time tomorrow?
- Same, same.

49:12.769 --> 49:16.398
All right. See you then. Hey.

49:16.472 --> 49:18.440
- Thanks for coming all the way out here.
- Don't worry about it, man.

49:18.508 --> 49:21.909
I've got a sailor
in every port.

49:21.978 --> 49:25.937
- Do you know where we're goin'?
- Yeah, I got, I got directions.

49:26.015 --> 49:28.313
Oh, grand.

49:30.687 --> 49:34.623
So, John,

49:34.691 --> 49:37.819
you know, there's women
and there's ladies.

49:39.062 --> 49:41.360
- Jojo's a lady.
- Yep.

49:44.000 --> 49:49.768
- So, did you fuck her?
- What do you do with information like this?

49:49.839 --> 49:53.366
What do you think I do? You see
the way I live. Counting angry lovers.

49:53.443 --> 49:57.743
Watching bad cartoons.
Gotta give me somethin'.

50:20.503 --> 50:24.064
Hey!

50:28.344 --> 50:30.369
You're it!

51:13.022 --> 51:15.354
Come on, boys.

51:15.425 --> 51:17.916
Let's go.

51:44.187 --> 51:46.849
And now I'd like to introduce

51:46.990 --> 51:48.981
our next artist from Steubenville, Ohio.

51:49.058 --> 51:52.653
I'm tellin' you that so tonight
you go home and hump your map.

52:15.651 --> 52:19.587
Dah, dah, dah, dah.

54:16.639 --> 54:19.472
"Beautiful girls. "

54:21.477 --> 54:24.469
You go in there,
you're gonna fall in love.

54:32.555 --> 54:34.580
My wife...

54:38.828 --> 54:41.228
is a beautiful woman.

54:44.167 --> 54:47.625
I met her in the sun.
S- Sun, sun.

54:47.703 --> 54:50.831
Sunny sun.

54:52.041 --> 54:54.635
I could never
fall in love at night.

55:13.462 --> 55:15.896
You wanna dance
with the muchachas?

55:15.965 --> 55:18.559
Twenty-one dollars.

56:20.830 --> 56:23.993
Did you call
the police?

56:25.334 --> 56:28.132
No.

56:28.204 --> 56:30.138
No?

56:33.376 --> 56:35.776
Do you wanna die?

56:38.714 --> 56:41.239
I don't know.

56:43.786 --> 56:45.913
Did you see her die?

56:58.601 --> 57:00.694
No.

57:04.040 --> 57:06.338
I was drunk.

57:08.277 --> 57:11.178
I didn't know
what happened.

57:15.051 --> 57:19.351
I just felt a bump.

57:19.422 --> 57:23.859
And when I stopped, I knew something
had happened. I just didn't know.

57:31.267 --> 57:35.260
She was lying
in the street...

57:35.338 --> 57:39.638
all torn up.

57:41.110 --> 57:45.444
And I could see her...

57:45.514 --> 57:48.415
moving a little bit.

57:51.687 --> 57:55.316
Her mouth
was kind of moving.

57:55.391 --> 57:58.485
I thought she was
talking to someone.

58:00.896 --> 58:04.730
You know,

58:04.800 --> 58:08.236
someone
who wasn't there.

58:08.304 --> 58:10.795
You know, someone...

58:12.775 --> 58:16.108
like her mother,
her father.

58:19.482 --> 58:23.646
When I got up to her,
I, uh,

58:23.719 --> 58:27.120
I kinda knelt down,

58:29.291 --> 58:33.728
and she wasn't talkin'
to someone else.

58:33.796 --> 58:36.959
She was talkin' to me.

58:39.235 --> 58:42.568
She was apologizing to me.

58:45.875 --> 58:50.073
She was apologizing
for not having looked both ways.

58:57.753 --> 59:02.952
And there were some people who were...
gathering around there.

59:03.025 --> 59:08.361
Somebody called
for an ambulance, so I-

59:12.868 --> 59:17.271
They found me on the Interstate.
I'd gone up north.

59:21.043 --> 59:25.412
I just got in my car
and I drove until I ran out of gas.

59:46.569 --> 59:49.732
You have
such a beautiful face.

59:55.544 --> 59:58.536
The way your eyes
slope.

01:00:00.449 --> 01:00:02.440
- Like a little puppy.
- I'm sorry.

01:00:02.518 --> 01:00:05.146
Don't say that.

01:00:42.358 --> 01:00:44.519
I think...

01:00:50.666 --> 01:00:54.762
that your guilt...

01:00:54.837 --> 01:00:58.466
is a little too much
competition for me.

01:01:00.175 --> 01:01:02.643
You should let me know...

01:01:02.711 --> 01:01:06.670
when you want life.

01:03:20.249 --> 01:03:23.013
You are such
an asshole.

01:03:27.022 --> 01:03:29.855
Where did you go?

01:03:44.006 --> 01:03:47.203
I mean, like, what do you think?

01:03:53.749 --> 01:03:57.583
Like you can just get up and go
in the middle of the night...

01:03:57.653 --> 01:04:03.182
and go your merry fucking way, and then
stumble back in here like it's not rude?

01:04:06.829 --> 01:04:10.094
Like I don't have
any feelings.

01:04:11.734 --> 01:04:14.601
And this means...

01:04:16.038 --> 01:04:18.973
I have no emotions...

01:04:20.776 --> 01:04:23.711
and I'm a whore.

01:04:26.081 --> 01:04:28.777
And I liked you.

01:04:28.851 --> 01:04:32.787
You know, I don't fuck
many guys. You know?

01:06:24.199 --> 01:06:28.226
Goal!

01:06:55.664 --> 01:06:57.655
Who is it?

01:06:57.733 --> 01:07:00.531
It's John.

01:07:21.089 --> 01:07:23.683
What's goin' on?

01:07:28.163 --> 01:07:30.529
What is guilt?

01:07:33.068 --> 01:07:34.660
What?

01:07:34.736 --> 01:07:38.399
You said guilt.
My guilt, my guilt.

01:07:38.473 --> 01:07:41.874
What is guilt?
Define it.

01:07:56.291 --> 01:07:58.555
Do you wanna dance?

01:08:07.402 --> 01:08:09.336
Let's dance.

01:08:11.373 --> 01:08:15.742
# Ooh, yeah, Ooh #

01:08:17.845 --> 01:08:19.575
# Yeah-ah, oh #

01:08:21.316 --> 01:08:24.615
- # All right #
- # Ooh, yeah-ah #

01:08:24.685 --> 01:08:28.281
# Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man #

01:08:28.357 --> 01:08:30.291
# Let's sing it now #

01:08:30.359 --> 01:08:33.725
# Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man #

01:08:33.795 --> 01:08:35.786
# He's a mighty, mighty
good man #

01:08:35.863 --> 01:08:39.459
# Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man #

01:08:39.533 --> 01:08:41.331
# Yes he is #

01:08:41.403 --> 01:08:45.703
# Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man #

01:08:45.774 --> 01:08:48.937
# I wanna take a minute or two
and give much respect #

01:08:49.011 --> 01:08:51.444
# To the man that's made
a difference in my world #

01:08:51.513 --> 01:08:54.482
# And although most men are hos
he goes on the down, no #

01:08:54.549 --> 01:08:57.109
# 'Cause I never heard about him
with another girl #

01:08:57.185 --> 01:09:00.120
# But I don't sweat it because it's
just pathetic to let it #

01:09:00.188 --> 01:09:02.782
# Get me involved in that
"he said, she said" crap #

01:09:02.858 --> 01:09:05.656
# I know there ain't
nobody perfect #

01:09:23.612 --> 01:09:26.843
# And although most men are hos
he goes on the down, no #

01:09:26.915 --> 01:09:29.383
# 'Cause I never heard about him
with another girl #

01:09:29.451 --> 01:09:32.613
# But I don't sweat it because it's
just pathetic to let it #

01:09:32.687 --> 01:09:35.656
# Get me involved in that
"he said, she said" crap #

01:09:35.724 --> 01:09:37.385
# I know there ain't
nobody perfect #

01:09:37.459 --> 01:09:39.393
# I give props to those
who deserve it #

01:09:39.461 --> 01:09:41.554
# And believe me, y'all
He's worth it #

01:09:41.630 --> 01:09:44.292
# So here's to the future
'cause we got through the past #

01:09:44.366 --> 01:09:48.301
# I finally found somebody
that could make me laugh #

01:09:48.370 --> 01:09:52.602
# You're so crazy
I think I wanna have your baby #

01:09:52.674 --> 01:09:56.132
# Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man #

01:09:56.211 --> 01:09:58.304
- # Yes he is #
- You keep dancin'.

01:09:58.380 --> 01:10:01.474
# Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man #

01:10:01.550 --> 01:10:04.519
# Yeah, a mighty good man #

01:10:04.653 --> 01:10:07.451
# Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man #

01:10:07.522 --> 01:10:09.149
# Say it again now #

01:10:09.224 --> 01:10:12.853
# Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man ##

01:10:19.134 --> 01:10:21.193
# Woke up #

01:10:21.269 --> 01:10:24.238
# To find #

01:10:24.306 --> 01:10:28.299
# I'd lost my mind #

01:10:28.376 --> 01:10:30.503
# Lost heart #

01:10:30.579 --> 01:10:32.604
# Lost nerve #

01:10:32.681 --> 01:10:36.879
# I lost my favorite word #

01:10:36.952 --> 01:10:39.352
# Emily #

01:10:41.756 --> 01:10:46.193
# I take my cigarettes
I give 'em a smoke #

01:10:46.261 --> 01:10:50.698
# Oh, God
my heart feels froze #

01:10:50.765 --> 01:10:52.926
# I've lost somethin' #

01:10:53.001 --> 01:10:59.167
# It seems I misplaced
my favorite thing #

01:10:59.241 --> 01:11:01.539
# Emily ##

01:11:03.578 --> 01:11:08.481
Our next entertainer, our next performer,
a wonderful artist here from Selma, Alabama.

01:11:08.550 --> 01:11:11.883
Let's have a great big welcome
for Mia! Let's hear it.

01:11:19.294 --> 01:11:22.786
# On the good ship
Lollipop #

01:11:22.864 --> 01:11:25.765
This is what I hate.
I hate this fuckin' number.

01:11:25.834 --> 01:11:30.271
It takes her four or five minutes to get the
flash off her for me to see a little titty.

01:11:30.338 --> 01:11:33.774
And in the meantime,
I've gotta listen to this music.

01:11:33.842 --> 01:11:36.470
I hate this fuckin' number!

01:11:36.545 --> 01:11:38.945
I like it.

01:11:39.014 --> 01:11:40.743
He likes it.

01:11:40.815 --> 01:11:44.251
- It's traditional.
- Oh, traditional!

01:11:46.922 --> 01:11:50.323
Without tradition,
new things die.

01:11:50.392 --> 01:11:52.860
"New things die"?

01:11:52.928 --> 01:11:55.829
The son of a bitch
is a poet!

01:11:55.897 --> 01:11:59.594
A jeweler poet.
First goddamn jeweler poet I ever saw.

01:11:59.668 --> 01:12:03.729
Oh, yeah. A Jew jeweler poet.

01:12:04.673 --> 01:12:08.404
Listen,
I'll kill the guy.

01:12:08.476 --> 01:12:12.503
You what? What the hell are you
talking about? Hey, did you hear that?

01:12:12.581 --> 01:12:14.276
- What?
- He's gonna kill some guy.

01:12:14.349 --> 01:12:17.318
- Who you gonna kill, Freddy?
- Nothing!

01:12:17.385 --> 01:12:20.479
- Freddy!
- I missed something. What's he talkin' about?

01:12:20.555 --> 01:12:22.682
Come dance with me!

01:12:22.757 --> 01:12:26.124
Yeah! Yeah!
That's it.

01:12:26.194 --> 01:12:28.628
Yeah!

01:12:28.697 --> 01:12:31.894
Come on, Freddy!

01:12:31.967 --> 01:12:34.128
Come on, Freddy,
dance with Mia.

01:12:34.202 --> 01:12:38.002
Go on, Freddy. Go on.
Dance with the fuckin' whore.

01:12:40.542 --> 01:12:43.375
Go for it!
Go for it!

01:12:56.424 --> 01:13:00.520
# If you eat too much
Oh, oh #

01:13:00.595 --> 01:13:03.758
# You'll awake
with a tummy ache #

01:13:03.832 --> 01:13:08.496
# On the good ship Lollipop
It's a nice trip ##

01:13:14.809 --> 01:13:18.802
Whoo!
Freddy, come on!

01:13:33.595 --> 01:13:36.962
Mmm.

01:13:37.032 --> 01:13:39.865
You tickled me!
Stop. Wait, wait, wait.

01:13:39.934 --> 01:13:42.732
I really wanna fuck you.
Stop!

01:13:42.804 --> 01:13:45.705
First I gotta play you
this song I wrote. Okay?

01:13:45.774 --> 01:13:47.765
Song?

01:13:47.842 --> 01:13:49.901
Gimme that bottle.

01:13:49.978 --> 01:13:51.969
Oh.

01:13:55.383 --> 01:14:00.377
Okay. I hope you like this
'cause I wrote this just for you.

01:14:00.455 --> 01:14:03.982
Don't let me go to sleep.
I got business tonight.

01:14:04.059 --> 01:14:08.996
# Four little ducks went out one day #

01:14:10.565 --> 01:14:14.433
# Over the hills
and far away #

01:14:16.338 --> 01:14:19.705
# Mama duck said #

01:14:19.774 --> 01:14:22.208
# Quack, quack
quack, quack #

01:14:26.147 --> 01:14:31.517
# But only... three little ducks
came back ##

01:14:31.586 --> 01:14:35.852
# If you could only
look and see #

01:14:37.425 --> 01:14:39.586
# To the chains #

01:14:39.661 --> 01:14:44.758
# Surrounding you Mmm #

01:14:44.833 --> 01:14:51.796
# You're the one that holds the key #

01:14:51.873 --> 01:14:59.370
# And you don't have
to make me a copy, ahh #

01:14:59.447 --> 01:15:04.316
# Oh, you are just the earth #

01:15:06.254 --> 01:15:12.090
# I am just the sky #

01:15:13.762 --> 01:15:18.222
# And when you leave
I won't ask why #

01:15:21.035 --> 01:15:25.597
# I'll take our nights
and say good-bye #

01:15:26.841 --> 01:15:29.469
Chorus.

01:15:29.544 --> 01:15:33.310
# Freddy and Mia #

01:15:36.684 --> 01:15:40.984
# Freddy and Mia #

01:15:44.058 --> 01:15:49.018
# Freddy and Mia ##

01:16:38.346 --> 01:16:41.782
- Hello?
- Mary, it's Freddy.

01:16:41.850 --> 01:16:45.877
- Freddy?
- Mary, please don't hang up. Please.

01:16:45.954 --> 01:16:49.754
- Where are you, Freddy?
- I need-

01:16:51.726 --> 01:16:56.823
- What?
- I'm fallin' apart, honey.

01:16:56.898 --> 01:17:01.460
- Freddy, what's the matter?
- I just had this fucking dream.

01:17:01.536 --> 01:17:03.094
What?

01:17:03.171 --> 01:17:06.629
It's sunny outside
and I'm driving my car and it,

01:17:06.708 --> 01:17:11.372
it feels real big
like it's driving me.

01:17:15.016 --> 01:17:19.544
And I'm driving past Em's school,
the elementary school.

01:17:21.656 --> 01:17:24.955
And there's a crosswalk.

01:17:26.761 --> 01:17:31.130
And all these little kids
are being...

01:17:31.199 --> 01:17:34.965
h- helped across
by a crossing guard.

01:17:36.104 --> 01:17:39.232
The crossing guard
is John Booth.

01:17:42.310 --> 01:17:44.778
Em's one
of the little kids.

01:17:49.784 --> 01:17:54.847
I'm gettin'...
closer and closer.

01:17:54.923 --> 01:17:58.359
And I'm...
I'm hittin' the brakes.

01:17:58.426 --> 01:18:00.656
The car won't slow down.

01:18:00.728 --> 01:18:05.722
I'm turning the wheel...
but the car won't turn.

01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:08.564
Oh, Freddy.

01:18:11.039 --> 01:18:13.337
Freddy.

01:18:13.408 --> 01:18:17.845
Then I just plow
right through... through 'em.

01:18:19.781 --> 01:18:21.612
Then I-

01:18:21.683 --> 01:18:26.245
Then I see Em's face...

01:18:26.321 --> 01:18:29.256
just, just before...

01:18:29.324 --> 01:18:31.451
just before I hit her.

01:18:31.526 --> 01:18:35.986
Oh.
No, Freddy. No.

01:18:36.064 --> 01:18:39.556
Come on. Come on.

01:18:41.102 --> 01:18:43.627
Come on.

01:19:23.111 --> 01:19:25.602
Two coffees.

01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:27.910
Sit there.

01:19:38.259 --> 01:19:41.319
Oh, Freddy.

01:19:45.900 --> 01:19:50.303
Mary, I-

01:19:50.371 --> 01:19:54.171
No, Freddy.
Let me talk.

01:19:56.411 --> 01:20:01.144
I've been so angry at you...
for so goddamn long.

01:20:03.384 --> 01:20:07.548
Too angry to see you,
or hear you or care about you.

01:20:11.526 --> 01:20:14.825
But when I heard you
on the phone tonight,

01:20:14.896 --> 01:20:17.126
I did see you...

01:20:19.167 --> 01:20:22.864
for the first time
since Emily was killed.

01:20:28.042 --> 01:20:31.910
I can see
you're a good man.

01:20:31.979 --> 01:20:35.847
And you loved her
so, so much.

01:20:35.917 --> 01:20:40.013
But I loved her too,
Freddy.

01:20:40.088 --> 01:20:43.421
I needed you so badly.

01:20:46.127 --> 01:20:48.994
But you-

01:20:59.373 --> 01:21:04.640
Do you remember...
when we were coming back from Vegas,

01:21:04.712 --> 01:21:08.148
and the wind, God-

01:21:08.216 --> 01:21:11.117
The plane was bouncing
all around.

01:21:12.754 --> 01:21:15.314
I thought-

01:21:15.389 --> 01:21:18.483
I was shaking.

01:21:18.559 --> 01:21:21.119
Do you remember
what you said?

01:21:24.365 --> 01:21:25.957
No.

01:21:28.236 --> 01:21:30.170
Uh, tell me.

01:21:30.238 --> 01:21:33.105
- Anything else?
- No, thanks.

01:21:33.174 --> 01:21:36.337
I couldn't believe
how calm you were.

01:21:36.410 --> 01:21:39.573
And you took my hand
and you said- Do you remember?

01:21:40.615 --> 01:21:43.641
No, no.
Tell me.

01:21:45.419 --> 01:21:49.014
You said,
"Pray we crash.

01:21:49.090 --> 01:21:52.526
Then we can call ourselves
survivors. "

01:21:56.197 --> 01:21:59.758
You were so-

01:22:01.335 --> 01:22:03.929
Where'd that guy go?

01:22:09.076 --> 01:22:11.408
Then Emmy died.

01:22:16.050 --> 01:22:18.814
It's-

01:22:18.886 --> 01:22:21.514
It's made you so small
and weak.

01:22:25.693 --> 01:22:29.561
I needed you
to be big and strong.

01:22:31.732 --> 01:22:33.791
I hated you
for your weakness.

01:22:33.868 --> 01:22:36.200
I hated you.

01:22:38.773 --> 01:22:42.209
Now I'm pitying you.

01:22:45.513 --> 01:22:49.244
I don't know
how to help you, Freddy.

01:22:58.826 --> 01:23:02.922
You look around...

01:23:02.997 --> 01:23:06.694
at the marriages
people have.

01:23:06.767 --> 01:23:10.203
We had a good one,
didn't we?

01:23:11.639 --> 01:23:13.607
Yes.

01:23:13.674 --> 01:23:16.268
Good times.

01:23:16.344 --> 01:23:19.006
No hidden agendas.

01:23:21.883 --> 01:23:24.852
None of the nasty bullshit
you see with other people.

01:23:28.356 --> 01:23:30.347
We were turned on.

01:23:30.424 --> 01:23:33.257
We were hot
for one another.

01:23:35.796 --> 01:23:40.426
- We were pals, right?
- That was a wonderful time.

01:23:40.501 --> 01:23:42.366
Best buddies.

01:23:48.142 --> 01:23:51.976
Correct me if I'm distorted
in my thinking on this.

01:23:52.046 --> 01:23:57.511
No.

01:24:04.558 --> 01:24:06.788
No, but...

01:24:14.802 --> 01:24:16.827
you pity me.

01:24:23.778 --> 01:24:26.508
You pity me.

01:24:36.223 --> 01:24:39.021
Oh, boy, this is a-

01:24:39.093 --> 01:24:42.494
This is a funny thing,
this thing, this-

01:24:42.563 --> 01:24:45.999
Freddy, whatever
you're doing, stop it.

01:24:46.067 --> 01:24:49.127
"Freddy, whatever
you're doing, stop it. "

01:24:50.538 --> 01:24:53.006
I hope you die.

01:24:53.074 --> 01:24:57.272
I hope you fucking die.

01:25:20.634 --> 01:25:22.625
Come on! Come on!

01:25:22.703 --> 01:25:24.898
Come on!
Come on!

01:25:51.999 --> 01:25:56.902
Sir, pull your vehicle
over to the right.

01:26:04.712 --> 01:26:09.240
- Sir, just stay in your vehicle.
- There's a gun on the seat.

01:26:09.316 --> 01:26:11.614
There's a gun in the car?
Step back here, sir.

01:26:11.685 --> 01:26:14.381
Step back here.

01:26:16.190 --> 01:26:18.556
Step over here, sir.
Stop right there. Turn around.

01:26:18.626 --> 01:26:21.424
Place your hands behind your head,
interlace your fingers.

01:26:21.495 --> 01:26:23.656
Do you have
any other weapons on you?

01:26:23.731 --> 01:26:25.596
No.

01:26:25.666 --> 01:26:27.896
Spread your feet for me.

01:26:27.968 --> 01:26:31.267
- I got a permit for the gun.
- You got a permit for the gun?

01:26:31.338 --> 01:26:33.329
- Yes.
- Why do you carry a gun, sir?

01:26:33.407 --> 01:26:36.535
I'm a jeweler.
I got a jewelry store.

01:26:36.610 --> 01:26:40.068
It's all I have.
I carry the gun to protect what I have.

01:26:40.147 --> 01:26:43.173
I can understand that. Do you
have the permit on you right now?

01:26:43.250 --> 01:26:45.548
- Yes, it's in my wallet.
- Okay.

01:26:45.619 --> 01:26:48.019
Put your hands down
for me.

01:26:48.089 --> 01:26:51.957
A.45, Dennis. It's loaded.
There's one in the chamber.

01:26:52.026 --> 01:26:54.119
It's loaded?
Okay.

01:26:54.195 --> 01:26:56.595
Take out your wallet, sir. Is your
driver's license in there also?

01:26:56.664 --> 01:26:59.827
Yes, sir.

01:26:59.900 --> 01:27:01.265
Here,
just hand it to me.

01:27:01.335 --> 01:27:03.860
He says there's a permit
for the gun in there, so-

01:27:03.938 --> 01:27:07.271
The reason we stopped you is you were driving
a little erratically this evening, sir.

01:27:07.341 --> 01:27:09.332
Have you had anything
to drink?

01:27:09.410 --> 01:27:13.972
- I had a couple of drinks a couple of hours ago, yeah.
- Blow on my hand for me.

01:27:14.048 --> 01:27:16.414
All right.

01:27:16.484 --> 01:27:20.181
We're gonna conduct a few tests to see how
much your ability to operate a motor vehicle...

01:27:20.254 --> 01:27:22.347
has been impaired by what
you've had to drink tonight.

01:27:22.423 --> 01:27:25.517
The first test I want you to do is
I want you to put your feet together.

01:27:25.593 --> 01:27:30.155
I want you to put your arms out to the
side and extend your index fingers out.

01:27:30.231 --> 01:27:33.462
Okay, I want you to tilt
your head back and close your eyes.

01:27:33.534 --> 01:27:38.198
Now I want you to take your right index
finger and touch the tip of your nose.

01:27:38.272 --> 01:27:40.502
Okay, just put your hand back
after you touch it.

01:27:40.574 --> 01:27:44.476
I want you to take your left finger,
touch the tip of your nose.

01:27:44.545 --> 01:27:47.241
Let's do
the left finger again.

01:27:47.314 --> 01:27:49.874
- Okay, sir. Put your hands down at your side.
- Permit's good.

01:27:49.950 --> 01:27:52.111
The permit's good?
Okay.

01:27:52.186 --> 01:27:54.586
I want you to come here and put
your right foot on the line here.

01:27:56.891 --> 01:28:00.520
Okay, on this one, sir, I want you
to take ten steps down the line.

01:28:00.594 --> 01:28:04.792
I want you to walk heel to toe. I want you
to put your left heel to your right toe.

01:28:04.865 --> 01:28:06.833
And I want you to count
the steps as you take them.

01:28:06.901 --> 01:28:10.598
When you get down here, I want you to turn
around and take ten steps back. You understand?

01:28:10.671 --> 01:28:13.231
- Yes.
- Go ahead.

01:28:13.307 --> 01:28:16.640
One, two, three,

01:28:16.710 --> 01:28:21.340
four, five, six,

01:28:21.415 --> 01:28:25.317
seven, eight, nine, ten.

01:28:25.386 --> 01:28:28.446
Okay, just turn around, sir.
We don't need to go back.

01:28:28.522 --> 01:28:30.888
I think, uh,
by what we've seen out here,

01:28:30.958 --> 01:28:32.983
you've had a little bit
too much to drink tonight.

01:28:33.060 --> 01:28:36.826
So, turn around, put your hands behind your
back. You're under arrest for drunk driving.

01:28:36.897 --> 01:28:39.331
Just turn around,
put your hands behind your back.

01:28:40.568 --> 01:28:43.833
Freeze! Stop!
Jesus.

01:28:44.271 --> 01:28:46.364
Show us in foot pursuit.

01:28:46.440 --> 01:28:48.965
14-0-9. We're in
foot pursuit. Man with a gun.

01:28:49.043 --> 01:28:52.706
Southbound on Inglewood from the 90
freeway. Request an air unit.

01:28:56.016 --> 01:28:58.780
Stop, you son of a bitch!

01:29:11.131 --> 01:29:14.464
Stop!
I'm gonna shoot your ass!

01:29:45.666 --> 01:29:48.430
- Police officers, sir. Police!
- What's going on?

01:29:48.502 --> 01:29:51.699
We just chased a guy with a gun
in here. Did you see where he went?

01:29:51.772 --> 01:29:53.831
I just heard my front door
bashed in. Then you got here.

01:29:53.907 --> 01:29:57.809
Hey, the back door's open.
- I got kids here.

01:30:01.949 --> 01:30:05.009
Just stay with us, okay?
This guy's got a gun, sir.

01:30:05.085 --> 01:30:07.383
Just stay with us.

01:30:18.465 --> 01:30:21.059
Honey, you all right?

01:30:22.536 --> 01:30:26.131
Yes, Daddy.
What was that noise?

01:30:26.206 --> 01:30:29.437
I'll tell you about it in the morning,
sweetheart. Just get to sleep.

01:30:29.510 --> 01:30:32.911
We gotta go out back
and keep looking for this guy.

01:30:32.980 --> 01:30:36.916
We'll send somebody back
in a little while and take a report.

01:30:45.159 --> 01:30:48.253
Good night, sweetheart.

01:33:21.982 --> 01:33:25.315
Gonna give you a laugh,
kid.

01:33:29.890 --> 01:33:34.452
I got pulled over tonight.
Police, right?

01:33:34.528 --> 01:33:37.224
The whole bit.

01:33:39.166 --> 01:33:43.296
You wanna guess
what for?

01:33:46.206 --> 01:33:49.607
Drunk driving.

01:33:51.411 --> 01:33:55.040
Drunk driving.

01:33:55.115 --> 01:33:57.845
And I had my gun.

01:34:00.854 --> 01:34:07.692
I'm not particularly
acquainted with the law, but...

01:34:07.761 --> 01:34:09.729
I'm on the run,

01:34:09.796 --> 01:34:13.027
I'm on your property
and I got my gun.

01:34:14.668 --> 01:34:18.934
I figure you could shoot me
and get away clean.

01:34:23.277 --> 01:34:26.508
So, I'm gonna-

01:34:28.582 --> 01:34:31.779
I'm gonna get my gun
out of my pants here.

01:34:42.095 --> 01:34:44.188
And I guess I'm gonna try
and shoot you.

01:35:10.657 --> 01:35:12.852
Huh?

01:35:14.094 --> 01:35:16.255
Hey!

01:35:17.898 --> 01:35:20.162
Hey, you son of a bitch.

01:35:24.638 --> 01:35:26.572
Hey!

01:36:34.141 --> 01:36:38.475
Come on. Come on.

01:37:03.036 --> 01:37:04.970
This just isn't working
for you out here.

01:37:05.038 --> 01:37:07.438
Hey, what is the fare
for him and for me?

01:37:07.507 --> 01:37:10.533
- I don't understand.
- What don't you understand?

01:37:10.610 --> 01:37:13.374
I come out here. I see you don't have a cent
to your name. I wanna know what you're doing.

01:37:13.447 --> 01:37:16.314
I don't get how you're makin'
any money. You're not making any money.

01:37:16.383 --> 01:37:19.477
I have a job. Yes, I am making money.
How can you say I'm not making money?

01:37:19.553 --> 01:37:21.680
If I'm paying rent
and I'm eating, I'm making money.

01:37:27.761 --> 01:37:31.754
- That's all you ever think about.
- You're not feeding yourself. You're not paying your rent.

01:37:31.832 --> 01:37:35.495
- I don't understand what you do for a living.
- You don't have to.

01:37:35.569 --> 01:37:37.833
- I do have to.
- I'm gettin' by.

01:37:37.904 --> 01:37:39.872
- Of course I have to.
- Why do you have to?

01:37:39.940 --> 01:37:44.001
Because the creditors call
my house. I co-signed on your lease.

01:37:44.077 --> 01:37:47.274
It's very easy for you to say
take your name off my lease.

01:37:47.347 --> 01:37:50.009
- It's very easy.
- The wrong stop.

01:37:50.083 --> 01:37:53.052
- If it's gonna be this major thing-
- It is a major thing.

01:37:53.120 --> 01:37:57.921
- And I want us to figure it out.
- I don't wanna figure it out, especially right now, okay?

01:37:57.991 --> 01:38:00.255
That's easy.
That's what you always do.

01:38:00.327 --> 01:38:03.023
Not right now.
That's it?

01:38:08.969 --> 01:38:12.063
- Whatever, okay? I don't wanna talk about this.
- So, what's your job?

01:38:12.139 --> 01:38:14.073
You don't listen.

01:38:14.141 --> 01:38:17.941
- I don't listen?
- What am I doing? I have a job.

01:38:18.011 --> 01:38:20.502
And I'm working.
I'm working for, you know.

01:38:20.580 --> 01:38:25.244
- For what?
- For money. And I've been paying my rent.

01:38:25.318 --> 01:38:29.015
So I think I'm pretty set.
I think I've been doing pretty good.

01:38:29.089 --> 01:38:33.253
I think that your standards are like,
like so high. So I don't have a car!

01:38:33.326 --> 01:38:36.193
- What're you doing?
- It's telemarketing. What's the difference?

01:38:36.263 --> 01:38:38.857
- It's telemarketing. What's the difference?
- You answer telephones?

01:38:38.932 --> 01:38:41.457
- Yeah, I answer telephones.
- And I hang up on people like you.

01:38:41.535 --> 01:38:44.129
Well, you know.
Hey. It pays the rent.

01:43:19.946 --> 01:43:22.972
Your daddy's coming.

01:43:26.319 --> 01:43:28.412
He is.

01:43:28.488 --> 01:43:30.820
And he needs your help.

01:43:55.415 --> 01:43:57.849
It's pink.

01:44:01.788 --> 01:44:05.280
Emily's stone is pink.

01:45:02.482 --> 01:45:05.246
I'm sorry.

01:45:06.486 --> 01:45:09.011
I'm sorry.
