16:36.959 --> 16:39.375
- Well, it sounded like

16:36.959 --> 16:39.375
there was gonna be more.

16:39.417 --> 16:42.583
I mean, I could have come up

16:39.417 --> 16:42.583
with that.

16:42.625 --> 16:44.792
- But you didn't.

16:44.834 --> 16:49.041
- You guys remotely closer

16:44.834 --> 16:49.041
to getting that thing fixed?

16:50.792 --> 16:53.250
Oh, I am on<i> fuego</i> today.

16:56.166 --> 16:58.750
- Hold up there, lumpy butt.

16:58.792 --> 17:03.792
- It's not me,

16:58.792 --> 17:03.792
it's these blousy pants.

17:03.834 --> 17:05.417
- You had this the whole time?

17:05.458 --> 17:08.667
- What? I thought

17:05.458 --> 17:08.667
I put that in the drawer.

17:08.709 --> 17:11.250
I mean, not that I ever

17:08.709 --> 17:11.250
had it to put in the drawer.

17:11.291 --> 17:13.166
I mean, hey.

17:11.291 --> 17:13.166
You found the remote.

17:13.208 --> 17:15.208
Let's go watch stuff, yay!

17:18.667 --> 17:20.083
- You hid the remote.

17:20.125 --> 17:22.125
You wanted us to wake up

17:20.125 --> 17:22.125
Mom and Dad.

17:22.166 --> 17:25.500
- Quiet.

17:22.166 --> 17:25.500
Do you hear that?

17:25.542 --> 17:30.166
<i>[distant screams]</i>

17:30.208 --> 17:32.000
It sounds like Mom and Dad

17:30.208 --> 17:32.000
are calling for us.

17:32.041 --> 17:33.834
- Maybe they need help.

17:33.875 --> 17:37.291
- Please, we're not falling

17:33.875 --> 17:37.291
for another one of your tricks.

17:37.333 --> 17:40.000
- Why aren't they coming

17:37.333 --> 17:40.000
to help us?

17:40.041 --> 17:42.417
- We did tell them

17:40.041 --> 17:42.417
not to disturb us.

17:42.458 --> 17:47.875
- Why is this the first time

17:42.458 --> 17:47.875
they actually do what we say?

17:47.917 --> 17:50.834
- Honey, my foot itches.

17:47.917 --> 17:50.834
- Hold on.

17:50.875 --> 17:53.291
[groans]

17:57.709 --> 17:59.333
- [sighs]

17:59.375 --> 18:01.500
Thank you.

17:59.375 --> 18:01.500
- You're welcome.

18:01.542 --> 18:03.625
- Maybe Dad noticed

18:01.542 --> 18:03.625
Clicky is gone.

18:03.667 --> 18:05.375
- What are you doing?

18:05.417 --> 18:08.125
- I'm going to tell them

18:05.417 --> 18:08.125
we didn't break Clicky.

18:08.166 --> 18:10.709
You know they're gonna believe

18:08.166 --> 18:10.709
whoever gets there first.

18:14.834 --> 18:16.375
- Wow.

18:16.417 --> 18:18.750
Nice job tricking them

18:16.417 --> 18:18.750
into going upstairs.

18:18.792 --> 18:21.041
- I wasn't tricking them!

18:21.083 --> 18:24.000
I'm freaking out!

18:24.041 --> 18:25.875
You should be too.

18:25.917 --> 18:27.667
- Me?

18:27.709 --> 18:29.625
- What if they tell Mom and Dad

18:27.709 --> 18:29.625
this was your fault?

18:29.667 --> 18:31.667
- My fault--they're the ones

18:29.667 --> 18:31.667
who broke Clicky.

18:31.709 --> 18:33.375
- Yeah, but you hid

18:31.709 --> 18:33.375
the TV remote

18:33.417 --> 18:37.500
and started this whole thing!

18:37.542 --> 18:40.375
- I just wanted to watch TV.

18:40.417 --> 18:45.041
Wait!

18:40.417 --> 18:45.041
Don't listen to them!

18:45.083 --> 18:50.583
- Help.

18:45.083 --> 18:50.583
- Please.

18:50.625 --> 18:53.458
- Dad, Dicky broke Clicky.

18:50.625 --> 18:53.458
- No, I didn't, she did.

18:53.500 --> 18:56.625
- Well, he's holding it.

18:53.500 --> 18:56.625
- Uh, no, I'm not.

18:56.667 --> 18:58.458
- Well, now, he's throwing it.

18:58.500 --> 19:00.792
Hey, what happened to the bed?

19:00.834 --> 19:03.083
- Clicky's broken?

19:00.834 --> 19:03.083
- Get us out of here.

19:03.125 --> 19:04.583
We're stuck.

19:04.625 --> 19:06.000
- But first, tell me

19:04.625 --> 19:06.000
what happened to Clicky.

19:06.041 --> 19:07.250
- No, first you will open

19:06.041 --> 19:07.250
this bed.

19:07.291 --> 19:08.834
- They're lying!

19:08.875 --> 19:11.333
I don't know how the remote got

19:08.875 --> 19:11.333
into my pocket.

19:11.375 --> 19:13.250
Hey, what happened to the bed?

19:13.291 --> 19:16.417
- Just open it!

19:20.333 --> 19:22.834
[both sighing]

19:28.750 --> 19:30.500
- What did you do

19:28.750 --> 19:30.500
to poor Clicky?

19:30.542 --> 19:33.000
- It's all Ricky's fault!

19:30.542 --> 19:33.000
- You dropped it in yogurt.

19:33.041 --> 19:37.834
- [shouts] Yogurt?

19:37.875 --> 19:40.750
I warned you.

19:37.875 --> 19:40.750
Ricky, Dicky, Dawn?

19:40.792 --> 19:46.083
No TV for a whole month.

19:40.792 --> 19:46.083
- Good parenting, Dad.

19:46.125 --> 19:50.375
Did these rude children wake you

19:46.125 --> 19:50.375
on your anniversary?

19:50.417 --> 19:53.709
For shame.

19:53.750 --> 19:57.041
- What are you talking about?

19:53.750 --> 19:57.041
You knew about all this.

19:57.083 --> 19:58.625
- Me?

19:58.667 --> 20:01.000
I've been so hard at work

19:58.667 --> 20:01.000
making breakfast.

20:01.041 --> 20:04.625
I hardly paid any attention

20:01.041 --> 20:04.625
to your childish arguing.

20:08.834 --> 20:11.542
Scones?

20:11.583 --> 20:13.250
- Thank you, Nicky.

20:13.291 --> 20:14.959
It's nice to know that

20:13.291 --> 20:14.959
at least one of our children

20:15.000 --> 20:18.542
cares more about us

20:15.000 --> 20:18.542
than about television.

20:18.583 --> 20:22.625
- Well, after all you've given

20:18.583 --> 20:22.625
me, it's the least I could do.

20:25.583 --> 20:28.417
Oh.

20:25.583 --> 20:28.417
I forgot to butter the scones.

20:32.000 --> 20:35.709
- Hold up there, butter boy.

20:32.000 --> 20:35.709
What are you up to?

20:35.750 --> 20:37.667
- I'm starting to worry

20:35.750 --> 20:37.667
about you.

20:37.709 --> 20:40.041
- You should be worried.

20:40.083 --> 20:42.834
You've all underestimated me

20:40.083 --> 20:42.834
for too long.

20:42.875 --> 20:47.792
And now the chickens

20:42.875 --> 20:47.792
have come home to roost.

20:47.834 --> 20:50.125
- When did we get chickens?

20:50.166 --> 20:52.750
- There are no chickens.

20:52.792 --> 20:55.375
But there is a rat.

20:55.417 --> 20:59.125
- You never let me use the

20:55.417 --> 20:59.125
remote, and now it's all mine.

20:59.166 --> 21:02.792
- You were supposed to zig.

20:59.166 --> 21:02.792
- But I zagged.

21:02.834 --> 21:08.417
- Nicky,

21:02.834 --> 21:08.417
I think those scones have been

21:02.834 --> 21:08.417
buttered enough-- with lies.

21:08.458 --> 21:10.792
You see, not only is Clicky

21:08.458 --> 21:10.792
the child who listens to me,

21:10.834 --> 21:13.166
she's also the one who tells me

21:10.834 --> 21:13.166
the truth.

21:14.709 --> 21:16.000
<i>- Thank you.</i>

21:22.041 --> 21:25.000
- There's a logical explanation

21:22.041 --> 21:25.000
for this.

21:25.041 --> 21:27.083
It was all his plan!

21:25.041 --> 21:27.083
He was the zag master.

21:27.125 --> 21:31.834
- Seriously?

21:27.125 --> 21:31.834
[overlapping arguing]

21:31.875 --> 21:33.709

- Yeah, yeah.

- We probably

should've just shared.

21:44.083 --> 21:45.333
- Yep.

21:45.375 --> 21:47.291
- Would have been better

21:45.375 --> 21:47.291
than this.

21:47.333 --> 21:50.834
- This is going to be

21:47.333 --> 21:50.834
