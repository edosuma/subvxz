WEBVTT

00:06.940 --> 00:10.511
- *

00:10.611 --> 00:13.347
- Louie, we are so lost.
- Oh, really?

00:13.447 --> 00:17.418
Here we are -- Drippy
Dan's Ice Cream Extravaganza.

00:17.518 --> 00:20.254
The happiest place
in Ghost World.

00:20.354 --> 00:22.022
- [distant scream]

00:22.123 --> 00:25.426
- Huh, they must be
outta mint chip.

00:25.526 --> 00:27.895
- This isn't an ice
cream factory.

00:27.995 --> 00:32.300
It's ghost World Prison for
the Criminally Insane.

00:32.400 --> 00:33.634
This is a place that
built to house

00:33.734 --> 00:37.305
the most ruthless criminal
ever--the Green Ghoul.

00:37.405 --> 00:39.039
- The Green Ghoul?

00:39.140 --> 00:42.143
I thought he was just a myth
like unicorns and Canada.

00:42.243 --> 00:44.178
- Oh, he's real.

00:44.278 --> 00:45.946
He was this close to
taking over the world--

00:46.046 --> 00:49.083
until he was stopped
by the amazing Thunderman,

00:49.183 --> 00:51.585
the greatest superhero who's
ever walked our planet.

00:51.685 --> 00:54.955
- Myles, you believe in
way too many silly things.

00:55.055 --> 00:56.424
Anyway, I'm pretty
sure this is

00:56.524 --> 01:00.294
where King Kong
plays racquetball.

01:00.394 --> 01:02.330
- Come on, let's get
outta here.

01:02.430 --> 01:04.132
- Right, and get ready for
Halloween tomorrow, bro.

01:04.232 --> 01:08.136
Those humans won't stand
a chance against my vampire bat.

01:08.169 --> 01:11.139
Check it!

01:11.205 --> 01:12.606
- Uh, Louie?

01:12.706 --> 01:18.579
- Watch as I soar high into the
sky with my terrifying wings.

01:18.679 --> 01:20.881
- Louie, you're not a bat!
You can't--

01:20.981 --> 01:23.251
- LOUIE: [thudding]

01:23.351 --> 01:26.520
[groaning]

01:26.620 --> 01:29.690
- Uh, are you okay?
- [laughing]

01:29.790 --> 01:36.430
Hello, Drippy Dan. I'll have a
chocolate double scoop, please.

01:36.530 --> 01:39.032
- You cracked the wall!

01:39.167 --> 01:44.872
Of all the days to forget
my lip balm/caulking pen.

01:44.972 --> 01:47.941
Let's get you home.

01:48.041 --> 01:51.679
- [energy whooshing]

01:51.779 --> 01:53.614
- MALE VOICE:
Finally, I'm free.

01:53.714 --> 01:55.449
Now to finish what I started

01:55.549 --> 01:58.919
and destroy the mighty
Thunderman.

01:59.019 --> 02:01.555
- [energy whooshing]

02:01.655 --> 02:03.857
- Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

02:03.957 --> 02:06.660
- Okay, Hank, it's just
a splinter.

02:06.760 --> 02:08.662
- Nnnnn!
- Got it.

02:08.762 --> 02:11.765
- Oh, stupid chopsticks.

02:11.865 --> 02:13.534
- Hey, Mom, have you seen
my black eyeliner?

02:13.634 --> 02:15.403
I need it for my
Halloween costume.

02:15.503 --> 02:17.305
- You're dressing up
for Halloween?

02:17.405 --> 02:18.839
- Yeah, Cherry's having
a big bash.

02:18.939 --> 02:22.643
I'm sure if you want to come,
everyone would not want that.

02:22.743 --> 02:24.712
- Good. Halloween's lame.

02:24.812 --> 02:27.515
Begging for candy.
Cheesy costumes.

02:27.615 --> 02:29.049
Am I right, Colosso?

02:29.217 --> 02:31.051
- Oh, yeah, totally lame.

02:34.488 --> 02:38.091
- Happy Halloween, guys!
- Oh, hey.

02:38.226 --> 02:42.630
A little racecar driver
and an adorable little...

02:42.730 --> 02:44.732
- Sushi.
- Sushi!

02:44.832 --> 02:46.700
- Thanks to my superspeed,

02:46.800 --> 02:48.702
we're gonna rake in candy from
all over the world.

02:48.802 --> 02:50.238
- But we're skipping
the countries

02:50.338 --> 02:53.607
where candy
tastes like goat.

02:53.707 --> 02:55.075
- WOMAN ANNOUNCING:
Alert! Alert!

02:55.243 --> 02:57.645
Emergency transmission
from the Hero League.

02:57.745 --> 02:59.513
- The Hero League?

02:59.613 --> 03:02.450
- It's Super-President
Kickbutt.

03:02.550 --> 03:04.785
- Thunderman, we have
a situation.

03:04.885 --> 03:06.254
The Green Ghoul
has escaped.

03:06.287 --> 03:07.488
- The Green Ghoul?

03:07.588 --> 03:09.122
Dad, didn't you throw
him in prison?

03:09.257 --> 03:11.259
- You're darn right.
Twenty years ago.

03:11.359 --> 03:14.862
You wouldn't recognize me.
It's before I had kids.

03:14.962 --> 03:19.367
- Yeah, because having kids
was so hard on your hips.

03:19.467 --> 03:23.070
- This youngster was seen in
the area during the escape.

03:23.170 --> 03:27.675
I'm not sure why he's
wearing a pumpkin outfit.

03:27.775 --> 03:29.277
But maybe he can help.

03:29.377 --> 03:31.178
We've tracked his whereabouts
to New Orleans.

03:31.279 --> 03:35.916
- New Orleans?
The guy is right here.

03:36.016 --> 03:39.287
- You're the only superhero
to ever defeat the Green Ghoul.

03:39.320 --> 03:42.490
We need you to come out of
requirement and do it again.

03:42.590 --> 03:44.858
We will deliver
everything you need.

03:44.958 --> 03:48.596
- [thunderous crash]

03:48.696 --> 03:52.800
- Can you tell us when?

03:52.900 --> 03:54.668
- Good luck, Thunderman.

03:54.768 --> 03:59.006
Super-President out.

03:59.106 --> 04:02.109
- Are you gonna do it, Dad?
- The world needs me, Billy.

04:02.209 --> 04:04.111
It may be the most dangerous,

04:04.211 --> 04:06.046
life-threatening assignment
of my career.

04:06.146 --> 04:07.815
And you're all coming
with me!

04:07.915 --> 04:10.751
- Yay!
- Family vacation!

04:10.851 --> 04:12.753
- Kids, this is
not a vacation.

04:12.853 --> 04:15.055
Your Dad's going to
battle the Green Ghoul.

04:15.155 --> 04:17.425
- Wait, Dad, what
about my party?

04:17.525 --> 04:19.893
I'm bringing the dip.

04:19.993 --> 04:22.630
- You are the dip.

04:22.730 --> 04:23.931
- I'm sorry, sweetie,
the Green Ghoul

04:24.031 --> 04:25.232
might come here
looking for me.

04:25.333 --> 04:27.234
It's not safe for you
guys to stay here.

04:27.335 --> 04:29.437
- Well, I am not missing
the party of the year

04:29.537 --> 04:31.238
because of some ghoul

04:31.339 --> 04:34.041
and there is no way you're
making me go to New Orleans.

04:34.141 --> 04:39.112
- Welcome to New Orleans!

04:39.212 --> 04:44.352
- *

04:50.358 --> 04:52.626
- Scott, did you get your
Frankenstein costume yet

04:52.726 --> 04:54.362
for Chad's Halloween party?

04:54.462 --> 04:56.697
Right, Chad's party.

04:56.797 --> 04:58.165
Taylor, I have bad news.

04:58.265 --> 05:01.001
I just got a call from People
and Pets Partnered Forever.

05:01.101 --> 05:05.373
You know, PAPPF.

05:05.439 --> 05:06.974
I have to administer
worm medicine

05:07.074 --> 05:08.876
to homeless dogs tonight.

05:08.976 --> 05:11.445
I can't go to the party.
- But you promised.

05:11.545 --> 05:13.414
This is gonna be our first
official party together.

05:13.514 --> 05:15.383
Chad was super-stoked
we were going.

05:15.416 --> 05:19.152
- Hey, guys, I'm really excited
you're coming to my party.

05:23.791 --> 05:26.394
- Or as excited as Chad gets.

05:26.494 --> 05:30.063
- I'm sorry, but PAPPF
really needs me.

05:30.163 --> 05:31.865
- Fine. Maybe I'll
just find another

05:31.965 --> 05:33.867
cute Frankenstein
to go with--

05:33.967 --> 05:36.470
One who doesn't leave me
alone on Halloween.

05:36.570 --> 05:38.305
- Look, Taylor, don't go.

05:38.406 --> 05:39.873
I promise I'll be
thinking of you

05:39.973 --> 05:42.810
the whole time
I'm deworming dogs.

05:42.910 --> 05:45.713
That sounded better
in my head.

05:45.813 --> 05:48.281
- According to
the Hero League,

05:48.416 --> 05:51.284
Pumpkin Boy has been
spotted in this bakery.

05:51.419 --> 05:54.855
- Hm, sounds like he
knows your weakness.

05:54.955 --> 05:57.157
- Okay, we may be
close to danger,

05:57.257 --> 06:00.828
so, I need each of you
to wear one of these.

06:00.928 --> 06:03.030
- Cool mood necklace.

06:03.130 --> 06:04.498
What's my mood, Nora?

06:04.598 --> 06:06.834
- Clueless.

06:06.934 --> 06:09.169
- It contains a jewel
called demonite,

06:09.269 --> 06:12.039
which can protect
against ghost possession.

06:12.139 --> 06:14.007
- And do not take them off.

06:14.107 --> 06:15.476
If the Green Ghoul were to
possess one of you,

06:15.576 --> 06:18.746
and added your powers to his,
there'd be no stopping him.

06:18.846 --> 06:21.449
- Hello, welcome
to Pie Squared.

06:21.549 --> 06:23.451
The pies used to be square,
but that didn't work

06:23.517 --> 06:26.520
and I'm not repainting
the sign.

06:28.822 --> 06:31.324
- It's Halloween. I should be
going to Cherry's party

06:31.459 --> 06:35.529
with all my friends, not sitting
here wearing demon bling.

06:35.629 --> 06:37.698
Why are you taking off
your demon bling?

06:37.798 --> 06:40.568
- Because I don't want to
ward off the Green Ghoul,

06:40.668 --> 06:42.069
I want to catch him.

06:42.169 --> 06:43.504
If I take down the greatest
supervillain ever,

06:43.604 --> 06:45.473
then I'd be
the greatest ever.

06:45.539 --> 06:47.174
Dad said he's
a level 13 ghost.

06:47.274 --> 06:48.876
What makes you think
you can take him down?

06:48.976 --> 06:51.111
- Because I have this...

06:51.211 --> 06:54.281
- Hello, New Orleans!

06:54.381 --> 06:55.616
- Colosso, what are
you doing here?

06:55.716 --> 06:58.085
- I came for French squares
and sweet tea.

06:58.185 --> 06:59.587
What, are you stupid?

06:59.687 --> 07:01.855
I came here to watch you take
down the Green Ghoul.

07:01.955 --> 07:03.290
- I'll deal with you later.

07:03.390 --> 07:05.192
- Hey, not the best trick.

07:05.292 --> 07:08.496
- This is what I was talking
about--my Ghost Zapper.

07:08.596 --> 07:10.097
It detects the presence
of ghosts

07:10.197 --> 07:12.633
and can blast away
the ghost's powers.

07:12.733 --> 07:16.269
- [zapper chirping]
- Oh, it's got something.

07:16.369 --> 07:18.171
- Wow, that thing's
really good...

07:18.271 --> 07:21.542
at detecting lemon squares.

07:21.642 --> 07:24.377
- It can be haunted
in the square. You don't know.

07:24.512 --> 07:26.514
- This is an outrage.

07:26.580 --> 07:28.616
These are posted
all over town.

07:28.716 --> 07:30.851
- "Give this girl only one piece
of Halloween candy

07:30.951 --> 07:33.320
by order of the Mayor."?

07:33.420 --> 07:36.624
That's cold.
- I know.

07:36.724 --> 07:39.326
I hate playing poker
with that clown.

07:39.426 --> 07:42.329
He's just crying because
I took too much last year.

07:42.429 --> 07:44.297
- Or because you put up that
billboard that said,

07:44.397 --> 07:47.300
"I win, suckers!"

07:47.400 --> 07:48.869
- I've gotta beat
this thing.

07:48.969 --> 07:51.104
- Lucky for you you've got
a tiny monster ghost

07:51.204 --> 07:52.439
at your disposal.

07:52.540 --> 07:55.208
- Really? Where?
You got a cousin?

07:55.308 --> 07:58.546
- I meant me. Observe.

08:02.015 --> 08:05.786
One levitating
table coming up.

08:05.886 --> 08:08.556
[straining]

08:10.023 --> 08:14.194
- I know that face. Do you need
to go to the bathroom?

08:14.294 --> 08:17.931
- [screaming]

08:18.031 --> 08:21.802
- Problem?

08:21.902 --> 08:24.772
- What is going on?

08:24.872 --> 08:27.040
- That little girl
out there just saw me.

08:27.140 --> 08:29.042
So, I scared her.

08:32.846 --> 08:35.148
- They can see us.

08:35.248 --> 08:37.284
That means they
have the "gift."

08:37.384 --> 08:38.752
I'll find out
who they are.

08:38.852 --> 08:41.321
[powers whooshing]

08:44.224 --> 08:47.628
- What's going on
with Dad's suitcase?

08:47.728 --> 08:51.398
- [powers whooshing]
- THUNDERMAN KIDS: [screaming]

08:51.498 --> 08:56.136
- I saw your suit!
You're Thunderman!

08:56.236 --> 08:58.171
- H-How did you
just do that?

08:58.271 --> 08:59.607
- I wasn't goofing.
I am a ghost.

08:59.707 --> 09:03.744
- Oh...
- THUNDERMAN KIDS: [screaming]

09:03.844 --> 09:05.846
- Wait, they can see
you're ghosts?

09:05.946 --> 09:08.749
- Uh, why, we...we don't
have ghosts.

09:08.849 --> 09:11.952
- Michelle, it's okay.
They have the gift.

09:12.052 --> 09:13.520
All superheroes do.

09:13.621 --> 09:16.056
- [laughing]
The boy is clearly delusional.

09:16.156 --> 09:20.227
We're not superheroes.

09:20.327 --> 09:22.229
- Yeah, if we were,
could I do this?

09:22.329 --> 09:23.964
[zooming]

09:26.533 --> 09:28.669
- I'm gonna say "yes."

09:28.769 --> 09:30.638
- Hey, it's little
Pumpkin Boy.

09:30.738 --> 09:33.473
- Only my grandma
calls me that, sir!

09:33.641 --> 09:36.443
I'm outta here.
[snaps fingers]

09:36.543 --> 09:37.978
- What is happening?

09:38.078 --> 09:40.280
- What's all the noise?
- BARB: [screams]

09:40.380 --> 09:42.249
[powers zapping]

09:42.349 --> 09:43.784
- Sweet!

09:43.884 --> 09:46.920
Could you do that to
about 4000 more of these?

09:50.090 --> 09:53.026
- Well, if you take the job, I'm
just gonna heat up this brownie.

09:53.126 --> 09:55.528
[powers zapping]

09:55.663 --> 09:59.166
- I think I'll close
up for the day.

10:03.336 --> 10:04.838
- So, the Green Ghoul is free

10:04.938 --> 10:07.074
and because of it,
the whole world's in danger?

10:07.174 --> 10:09.877
- Uh, yeah.

10:09.977 --> 10:11.779
Until my hero,
the mighty Thunderman

10:11.879 --> 10:14.114
swoops in
and saves the planet.

10:14.214 --> 10:19.219
- Hey, I save the planet
every day--with my music.

10:19.319 --> 10:21.855
- [jazz saxophone]

10:21.955 --> 10:23.857
- Dad, please?

10:23.957 --> 10:28.528
You're annoying Thunderman.
- [silently] A little bit.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.664
- Hey, it's Taylor, right?

10:30.764 --> 10:32.232
I've never passed my hand
through a ghost before.

10:32.332 --> 10:34.735
[loud thud]

10:34.835 --> 10:37.938
- And you still haven't.
Not a ghost.

10:38.038 --> 10:40.741
Hey, can I ask you
a question?

10:40.841 --> 10:42.542
Do you think it's weird a boy
I just started dating

10:42.642 --> 10:45.412
would rather deworm dogs
than go to a party with me?

10:45.512 --> 10:47.114
- Hm?

10:47.214 --> 10:49.783
I'm not sure I care.

10:49.883 --> 10:51.451
- No, really, it's just...

10:51.551 --> 10:53.386
I mean, I love that
he loves animals.

10:53.486 --> 10:56.256
But it's Halloween and--
- [powers whooshing]

10:56.356 --> 11:00.293
- Max.
[powers whooshing]

11:00.393 --> 11:02.896
I apologize
for my brother.

11:02.996 --> 11:06.033
You'll like him less when
you get to know him.

11:06.133 --> 11:08.035
- So, since you two
aren't leaving

11:08.135 --> 11:11.772
until your Dad catches
Ghosty McGreenjeans,

11:11.872 --> 11:13.106
how would you like
to help me out

11:13.206 --> 11:16.109
with the greatest trick or
treating plan ever?

11:16.209 --> 11:18.812
- That plan is brilliant!

11:18.912 --> 11:20.981
- We haven't even
heard it yet.

11:21.081 --> 11:24.852
- Oh, I trust her.
The glasses mean she's smart.

11:24.952 --> 11:27.154
- Ah, let's go to my room.

11:27.254 --> 11:30.758
You two superheroes are gonna be
the world's greatest wingmen.

11:30.858 --> 11:33.460
- Hold on, I thought
I was your wingman.

11:33.560 --> 11:36.096
- We have superpowers.
- [laughing]

11:36.196 --> 11:37.831
Superpowers?

11:37.931 --> 11:42.770
Sweetheart, I'm the baddest
ghost in all of New Orleans.

11:42.836 --> 11:45.538
- [bird pecking]

11:45.638 --> 11:50.677
- He did say
he was the baddest.

11:50.778 --> 11:52.445
- [knocks on door]
Knock, knock.

11:52.545 --> 11:54.547
I'm here to pick up
my party pastries.

11:54.647 --> 11:56.316
- Oh, of course.

11:56.416 --> 11:58.786
- Oh, hello, ladies.

11:58.886 --> 12:01.554
- Chad, we made lemon tarts.

12:01.654 --> 12:04.624
Are you okay?
- Never better.

12:04.792 --> 12:06.827
Hi, I'm Chad.
- I'm Phoebe.

12:06.927 --> 12:08.929
- I'm having a Halloween
party tonight.

12:09.029 --> 12:10.397
Would you like to come?

12:10.497 --> 12:12.399
- And miss spending quality
time with my family?

12:12.499 --> 12:15.168
You could literally be anyone
and I would say "yes."

12:15.268 --> 12:18.338
- Awesome.
We can go together.

12:18.438 --> 12:20.540
- Now it's flashing again.

12:20.640 --> 12:25.012
Oh. Sorry, but I won't be able
to attend your little shindig.

12:25.112 --> 12:27.214
- Didn't invite ya.
- PHOEBE: [laughing]

12:27.314 --> 12:29.649
- Until tonight, Phoebe.

12:29.817 --> 12:31.218
- What's that
guy's problem?

12:31.318 --> 12:33.220
- Oh, do you mean that
he's cute, charming,

12:33.320 --> 12:34.387
and doesn't like you?

12:34.487 --> 12:36.824
Not a problem.

12:36.890 --> 12:38.691
- Whatever.

12:38.826 --> 12:42.229
Time to catch myself
a Green Ghoul.

12:42.329 --> 12:48.902
- *

12:53.706 --> 12:55.242
- PHOEBE & TAYLOR:
Ta-da!

12:55.342 --> 12:57.978
- Oh, come on, girls,
put your costumes on.

12:58.078 --> 12:59.379
It's getting late.

12:59.479 --> 13:01.348
- WOMEN: [laughing]

13:01.448 --> 13:06.519
- Arg, our mothers
be crackin' jokes.

13:06.619 --> 13:08.155
- So, Barb, are you sure it's
okay for the girls

13:08.255 --> 13:10.090
to go to a party with
the Green Ghoul on the loose?

13:10.190 --> 13:13.093
- Don't worry about the girls--
Phoebe's sidekick,

13:13.193 --> 13:17.097
the Pulverizing Phantom will be
there to protect them.

13:17.197 --> 13:19.366
- PP?
- That's right.

13:19.466 --> 13:24.537
PP is here, PP is there.
PP is everywhere!

13:24.637 --> 13:27.074
What?

13:29.076 --> 13:32.112
Ooh, now I hear it.

13:35.248 --> 13:36.950
- What's all that, Hank?

13:37.050 --> 13:39.186
- Ah, state-of-the-art
ghost cage.

13:39.286 --> 13:41.021
Once I throw the Green Ghoul
in this thing,

13:41.121 --> 13:43.356
he'll be powerless
to escape.

13:43.456 --> 13:44.457
- I like it.

13:44.557 --> 13:48.561
Move over. I'll help.
- Uh, it's okay, Ray.

13:48.661 --> 13:52.465
Not to brag, but this is
kind of a superhero thing.

13:52.565 --> 13:55.135
- Look, I may not be
a superhero,

13:55.235 --> 13:56.736
but I am a level 10 ghost.

13:56.904 --> 14:00.507
And Myles needs to know his old
man's got some game, too.

14:00.607 --> 14:03.911
- Well, thanks, but, uh...
I got this.

14:03.944 --> 14:06.046
- [metal thuds]

14:06.146 --> 14:08.781
-Yeah, get in on this.
- Uh-huh.

14:11.985 --> 14:15.055
- [zapper chirping]
- Max, freeze.

14:15.155 --> 14:17.724
[clears throat]

14:17.824 --> 14:19.326
Ghost Zapper?

14:19.426 --> 14:22.095
You are not going after
the Green Ghoul.

14:22.195 --> 14:23.931
- Well, somebody has to.

14:23.997 --> 14:25.198
You're obviously too busy

14:25.298 --> 14:28.068
building a playhouse
with your new friend.

14:28.168 --> 14:30.938
- It's way too dangerous
and it's not a playhouse.

14:30.971 --> 14:34.107
It's a really hard-to-put-
together ghost cage thing.

14:34.207 --> 14:36.143
- Come on, Dad, catching
the Green Ghoul

14:36.243 --> 14:38.111
would put me on the map
in the supervillain world.

14:38.211 --> 14:39.679
- You're not ready

14:39.779 --> 14:41.648
and stop pretending you're
a supervillain.

14:41.748 --> 14:45.185
- I'm not pretending.
- We all know it's a phase, Max.

14:45.285 --> 14:48.655
It's time for you
to grow out of it.

14:48.755 --> 14:52.725
- Hank, I can't figure out where
the slide's supposed to go.

14:52.825 --> 14:55.128
- It's not a playhouse!

14:58.265 --> 15:02.702
- So, Max, I hope you're gonna
do the right thing.

15:02.802 --> 15:05.438
- I'm gonna disobey my Dad
and hunt the Green Ghoul.

15:05.538 --> 15:08.775
- That's the right
thing. Yeah!

15:12.079 --> 15:15.348
- [military-type music]

15:20.253 --> 15:23.156
- This is a field of
battle, people.

15:23.256 --> 15:24.791
What we do tonight will
make the difference

15:24.891 --> 15:26.994
between coming home with
a boatload of candy

15:27.027 --> 15:30.763
or some number two pencils
and a box of raisins.

15:30.863 --> 15:32.099
Let's review the plan.

15:32.199 --> 15:33.733
Billy?
- Sir!

15:33.833 --> 15:37.870
I pull a red wagon from house to
house at superspeed, sir!

15:38.005 --> 15:39.239
- Good. Nora?

15:39.339 --> 15:42.109
- Sir! I laser down tree
branches to block the path

15:42.209 --> 15:45.412
of competing trick
or treaters, sir!

15:45.512 --> 15:47.780
- Excellent!
Any questions?

15:47.880 --> 15:50.683
- I have a question.

15:50.783 --> 15:53.886
I'm not hearing the name Louie
anywhere in this plan.

15:54.021 --> 15:56.589
- That's not a question.

15:56.689 --> 16:00.060
- Am I hearing the name Louie
anywhere in this plan?

16:00.160 --> 16:03.563
Am I?

16:03.663 --> 16:05.898
- Sorry, big guy, but the
superhero crew and I

16:06.033 --> 16:07.200
have this covered.

16:07.300 --> 16:10.403
This is a huge night,
and let's face it,

16:10.503 --> 16:13.073
lately you've been in
a bit of a slump.

16:13.173 --> 16:14.574
- Oh, really, and how long

16:14.674 --> 16:18.045
have I been in this
so-called "slump"?

16:18.145 --> 16:20.780
- How long have
I known you?

16:20.880 --> 16:23.216
- I can't believe you don't
want my help, Frankie.

16:23.316 --> 16:27.554
- Louie, don't look
at it like that.

16:27.654 --> 16:31.458
That's all. Just don't
look at it like that.

16:34.327 --> 16:39.866
- [loud party music]

16:39.966 --> 16:42.469
- [cellphone beeping]

16:42.569 --> 16:45.605
- Another text from Scott?
I feel bad.

16:45.705 --> 16:47.707
I think I really scared him
when I teased him

16:47.807 --> 16:49.609
about bringing another
date to the party.

16:49.709 --> 16:53.680
- Taylor, he ditched
you for dog worms.

16:53.780 --> 16:56.349
- Yeah, let's keep
that between us.

16:56.449 --> 16:58.485
- I'm just saying he could
use a little scaring

16:58.585 --> 17:01.621
and you would use
an awesome party.

17:01.721 --> 17:06.226
- Speaking of awesome, Chad is
totally checking you out.

17:06.326 --> 17:07.760
- OMG, how do I look?

17:07.860 --> 17:10.730
- Like you're
missing an eye.

17:10.830 --> 17:14.601
Here he comes. Good luck.

17:14.701 --> 17:17.304
- [powers whooshing]

17:17.404 --> 17:18.805
Phoebe, you came.

17:18.905 --> 17:21.508
- Hey, Chad, how arrrr ya?
[laughing]

17:21.608 --> 17:25.612
Yeah, I shoulda kept
the eye patch.

17:25.712 --> 17:27.647
- Can I show you around?

17:27.747 --> 17:30.617
The moonlit garden
is positively bewitching.

17:30.717 --> 17:32.685
- Uh, yeah, I'd like that.

17:32.785 --> 17:36.589
- [powers whooshing]
Sidekick in the house!

17:36.689 --> 17:40.560
- Sorry, Chad, would you
excuse us, uh, me.

17:45.132 --> 17:46.833
- Hey, check it out.

17:46.933 --> 17:49.736
See, invisibility isn't
my only superpower.

17:49.836 --> 17:53.773
Funky dance moves,
activate. Woo! Woo!

17:53.873 --> 17:55.708
Woo! Woo!

17:55.808 --> 17:58.278
- What are you doing?

17:58.378 --> 17:59.846
- Honestly?

17:59.946 --> 18:03.049
Second-guessing
the tights.

18:03.150 --> 18:05.352
- [zapper chirping]
- Oh, now what?

18:07.720 --> 18:09.956
- [zapper chirping]
- Pretending?

18:10.056 --> 18:12.192
I'll show Dad
who's pretending.

18:12.292 --> 18:14.661
[squeals]

18:14.761 --> 18:16.163
- Max, what are
you doing here?

18:16.229 --> 18:18.064
I thought you were
out ghost hunting.

18:18.165 --> 18:20.400
- I am. My Ghost Zapper
is detecting

18:20.500 --> 18:23.403
extreme ghost activity
at this party.

18:23.503 --> 18:29.376
I think it'll lead me
right...to...

18:29.476 --> 18:33.513
Myles!

18:33.613 --> 18:35.182
- Drive the bus.
Anh! Anh!

18:35.248 --> 18:37.049
Drive the bus.
Anh! Anh!

18:37.184 --> 18:39.752
Drive the bus...
- [zapper chirping]

18:39.852 --> 18:44.090
- Wait a minute. Myles isn't
the only ghost here.

18:44.191 --> 18:47.227
The hunt continues.

18:47.327 --> 18:54.701
Uh-oh, bouncer's coming.

18:54.801 --> 18:56.536
- Max, what do you
think you're doing?

18:56.636 --> 18:58.205
- Just pretend to
be my girlfriend.

18:58.271 --> 19:01.474
- Hey, kid, I don't remember
checking you in.

19:01.574 --> 19:03.610
- Relax, buddy,
I'm with my girl.

19:03.710 --> 19:07.914
I'm her plus one,
right, babe?

19:08.014 --> 19:09.749
- Right.

19:09.849 --> 19:11.984
- Flirt alert!
- [cellphone camera clicks]

19:12.084 --> 19:13.986
- Looks like someone's
stepping out on Scott.

19:14.086 --> 19:16.389
- What? Wait. No, Amanda,
you've got it all wrong.

19:16.489 --> 19:17.990
- Photos don't lie.
[laughing]

19:18.090 --> 19:20.327
You're gonna be the talk
of the school, Taylor.

19:20.427 --> 19:23.730
- But I don't like this guy.
Like yucky, blah!

19:23.830 --> 19:25.698
Oh, this is bad.

19:25.798 --> 19:27.667
Amanda's gonna post
that photo everywhere

19:27.767 --> 19:30.036
and say we're a couple.
- Who cares?

19:30.136 --> 19:34.607
And, by the way, you could
do a lot worse.

19:34.707 --> 19:37.244
- Could I?

19:37.277 --> 19:39.912
We need to get that photo back
and you're helping.

19:40.012 --> 19:44.351
- No, I don't think so.
I have a Green Ghoul to catch.

19:44.451 --> 19:45.852
- Walk away and I'll shove
this candy corn

19:45.952 --> 19:48.555
so deep in your ear hole,
you'll sneeze orange.

19:48.655 --> 19:50.757
- Let's get that phone.

19:53.059 --> 19:54.827
- CHAD: There you are.

19:54.927 --> 19:57.063
Are you ready for
that garden stroll?

19:57.163 --> 19:58.598
- I'm ready.

19:58.698 --> 20:00.032
- Phoebe!

20:00.132 --> 20:01.901
I have urgent sidekick news.

20:02.001 --> 20:04.837
There's an apple-bobbing contest
on the front porch.

20:04.937 --> 20:09.842
All I'm worried about
is that guy.

20:09.942 --> 20:12.545
- Oh, you know,
I lost my phone.

20:12.645 --> 20:14.947
- I'm on the case.
Fear not.

20:15.047 --> 20:18.951
PP will cover
this entire house.

20:19.051 --> 20:22.822
- Can he really not
hear himself?

20:22.922 --> 20:25.825
Oh, I talk to myself
a lot. Let's go.

20:30.363 --> 20:32.399
- FRANKIE: Whew,
that was a close one.

20:32.499 --> 20:33.900
- I'll say.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.902
That lady was about
to give us hard candy

20:36.002 --> 20:42.008
until I reminded her
that we're not sucking them!

20:42.108 --> 20:45.345
- Okay, get in the wagon
and let's motor.

20:45.445 --> 20:47.980
- Evening, superchumps.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.716
- Louie, why are you
dressed like a Christmas elf?

20:49.816 --> 20:52.051
It's Halloween
not Halloweird.

20:52.151 --> 20:54.287
- Oh, I know what
day it is.

20:54.387 --> 20:57.557
And these boots keep
my feet toasty.

20:57.657 --> 20:59.659
Anyway, check the bucket.

20:59.759 --> 21:01.361
- Not bad.

21:01.461 --> 21:03.630
- That's right--not bad.
Where's your candy?

21:03.730 --> 21:05.332
- Right over there.

21:05.365 --> 21:07.434
- You mean behind
that mountain?

21:07.534 --> 21:09.168
- It is the mountain.

21:09.336 --> 21:14.341
- Rush! I mean, no reaction.

21:14.441 --> 21:17.477
- Look, Louie, the three of
us are crushing it on our own.

21:17.577 --> 21:20.613
Maybe you should go see
if Santa needs some help.

21:20.713 --> 21:22.815
- Are you calling me
a mess up?

21:22.915 --> 21:25.051
- Good, we're on
the same page.

21:25.151 --> 21:27.687
- You, madam, have just
woken the sleeping elf.

21:27.787 --> 21:31.123
Watch and learn.
[powers whooshing]

21:31.223 --> 21:33.360
This is very big in Paris.
[powers whooshing]

21:37.664 --> 21:39.265
- It's a beautiful night.

21:39.366 --> 21:42.602
- A beautiful night.
A beautiful girl.

21:42.702 --> 21:45.738
- Oh, stop.
- Okay.

21:45.838 --> 21:49.041
- No, I have to say that.
Keep going.

21:49.141 --> 21:53.380
- That amulet
is fascinating.

21:53.480 --> 21:55.147
May I see it?

21:55.247 --> 21:57.384
- Yeah, I...I guess so.

22:01.854 --> 22:04.791
- Pure demonite.

22:04.891 --> 22:08.395
Keeps you from
ghostly possession.

22:08.495 --> 22:11.998
- How did you know
that, Chad?

22:12.098 --> 22:15.402
- [Green Ghoul's voice]
Because I'm not Chad.

22:15.468 --> 22:17.269
[powers zapping]

22:23.776 --> 22:25.412
- [Green Ghoul's voice]
With my ghost powers,

22:25.478 --> 22:27.847
and Phoebe Thunderman's
superpowers,

22:27.947 --> 22:30.917
I will rule the world!

22:31.017 --> 22:35.622
But, first, to get
my revenge on Thunderman.

22:35.722 --> 22:38.124
[powers whooshing]

22:38.224 --> 22:40.226
- [objects shatter]

22:40.326 --> 22:44.531
- [Green Ghoul laughing]
Yes.

22:48.234 --> 22:49.602
- Max, would you come on.

22:49.702 --> 22:53.272
You know, for a superhero,
you move super slowly.

22:53.440 --> 22:55.608
- I am the supervillain,
thank you,

22:55.708 --> 22:58.578
And you sort of remind
me of my sister.

22:58.678 --> 23:00.346
It's not a compliment.

23:00.447 --> 23:02.348
- We have to find Amanda
and delete that picture of us

23:02.449 --> 23:03.816
before Scott sees it.

23:03.916 --> 23:07.720
- So, he sees a photo of us.
What's the big deal?

23:07.820 --> 23:09.456
- I'm kinda new to the couple
thing, but I'm pretty sure

23:09.556 --> 23:14.093
number one rule is don't hold
hands with other guys.

23:14.193 --> 23:15.995
- Look, phone girl.

23:16.095 --> 23:17.997
Watch the master take
care of business.

23:18.097 --> 23:19.832
[powers whooshing]
- Wait. Wait.

23:19.932 --> 23:23.035
- [cellphone plunks]

23:23.135 --> 23:25.071
- Oh, my gosh,
that was so great, Max.

23:25.171 --> 23:26.606
- That's what I do.

23:26.706 --> 23:28.575
- Except that was
the wrong girl.

23:28.675 --> 23:31.143
- [cellphone beeping]
- [gasping]

23:31.243 --> 23:34.046
- What now?
- Amanda posted the picture.

23:34.146 --> 23:37.550
Scott's gonna see it.
My life is over.

23:37.650 --> 23:40.553
- Taylor, you need to focus
on the positive.

23:40.653 --> 23:42.154
- Which is?

23:42.254 --> 23:45.492
- How great do I look
in this picture?

23:48.495 --> 23:50.597
- [powers whooshing]

23:50.697 --> 23:52.632
[Green Ghoul's voice]
Heat breath.

23:52.732 --> 23:56.536
Ooh, this is fun--
like a new toy.

23:56.636 --> 23:58.104
[Phoebe's voice]
Get out of me

23:58.204 --> 23:59.772
you green slimeball!

23:59.872 --> 24:01.674
[Green Ghoul's voice]
Why are you hitting yourself?

24:01.774 --> 24:03.876
Stop hitting yourself.
Why are you hitting yourself?

24:06.513 --> 24:09.381
- Looks like some people
just can't hold their candy.

24:11.518 --> 24:13.152
Oh, Phoebe, I looked
everywhere,

24:13.252 --> 24:14.521
but no sign of your phone.

24:14.587 --> 24:17.389
- [Green Ghoul's voice]
Be gone, pesky little boy.

24:17.524 --> 24:19.526
- Phoebs, I'm sensing
you're not loving

24:19.559 --> 24:21.994
the whole sidekick idea.

24:22.094 --> 24:26.132
May I point out that I could be
a very valuable asset.

24:26.232 --> 24:29.001
A level five ghost.

24:29.101 --> 24:34.040
- [Green Ghoul's voice]
Well, I'm a level 13.

24:34.140 --> 24:35.542
- So, we're not
gonna apple bob?

24:35.642 --> 24:37.744
- [powers whooshing]

24:37.844 --> 24:41.013
[Green Ghoul's voice]
See you around, PP boy.

24:41.113 --> 24:44.551
You should really
change that.

24:50.456 --> 24:52.291
- This is pretty awesome,

24:52.391 --> 24:54.260
but don't let success
go to our heads.

24:54.360 --> 24:55.862
- FRANKIE: Bow to us,
peasants.

24:55.962 --> 24:59.566
Lady Mannequin and Piece of
Sushi rule the night!

24:59.632 --> 25:01.668
- Yeah, that is more fun.

25:01.768 --> 25:04.203
Kneel before your
candy lords!

25:04.303 --> 25:07.607
- Look at this haul.

25:07.707 --> 25:09.842
We lifted over
17 times thanks to

25:09.942 --> 25:13.245
Billy's superspeed
costume changes.

25:13.345 --> 25:19.418
- I don't know who
I am any more.

25:19.586 --> 25:21.688
- Come on, Frankie.
It's getting late.

25:21.788 --> 25:23.790
Let's get back
into our candy.

25:23.890 --> 25:27.059
These full-sized babies
are calling my name.

25:27.159 --> 25:28.628
- Not yet.

25:28.728 --> 25:31.430
I'm going back to City Hall
to show Mayor McThree Chins

25:31.598 --> 25:35.501
who really runs this town.

25:35.602 --> 25:40.439
Billy, the getaway.
- You got it.

25:40.607 --> 25:42.508
- [metal clanks]

25:44.944 --> 25:47.079
- Oh, my gosh,
are you okay?

25:47.179 --> 25:48.414
- Whew. I think so.

25:48.514 --> 25:52.652
- I was talking
to the candy.

25:52.752 --> 25:56.823
- I know I'm no mechanic,
but this wagon's toast.

25:56.923 --> 25:59.992
- Shh, do you hear
something?

26:00.092 --> 26:03.763
- Look, those kids
are glaring at us.

26:03.863 --> 26:05.431
- Maybe they're coming to
congratulate us

26:05.531 --> 26:07.900
on snagging all
the neighborhood candy.

26:08.000 --> 26:11.437
- Yeah? I don't think so.
What do we do?

26:11.537 --> 26:13.806
- We pray, Sushi.

26:13.906 --> 26:16.142
We pray.

26:19.812 --> 26:22.782
- Oh, the demon light power.

26:22.882 --> 26:25.652
The cage is set and ready for
the ghoul when he comes for me.

26:25.718 --> 26:26.853
- Well, it's looking great.

26:26.953 --> 26:28.855
- FRANK & RAY:
Thank you.

26:28.955 --> 26:33.025
- Ha, Ray, I know you're trying
to prove something to Myles,

26:33.125 --> 26:37.063
but so far all you've done is
glue a wrench to my back.

26:37.163 --> 26:41.968
- Excuse me? Who built
this state-of-the-art doorbell?

26:42.068 --> 26:44.737
- First of all, what ghost
cage needs a doorbell?

26:44.837 --> 26:46.773
And second of all, that is
a buzzer from a board game.

26:46.873 --> 26:48.675
- [buzzer buzzing]
- Don't buzz me.

26:48.775 --> 26:50.576
- Oh, I'm buzzing you.
- [buzzer buzzing]

26:50.677 --> 26:52.311
- Quit it.
- [buzzer buzzing]

26:52.411 --> 26:54.413
- No, I'm not quitting.
- Quit buzzing me, Ray.

26:54.513 --> 26:55.948
- [buzzer buzzing]
- Stop it!

26:56.048 --> 26:57.884
Stop with your buzzing!
- [buzzer buzzing]

26:57.984 --> 26:59.585
- Stop it! Stop it! Stop--

26:59.686 --> 27:02.689
- [powers zapping]

27:02.722 --> 27:07.193
You kids are giving
me a headache!

27:07.293 --> 27:09.328
- Hey, son, why aren't you out
trick or treating

27:09.428 --> 27:10.863
with the other kids?

27:10.963 --> 27:13.232
- Because they think I'm
a good for nothing ghost.

27:13.332 --> 27:14.533
- Oh, come on, sweetie.

27:14.701 --> 27:16.302
I mean, I know I've
only just met you,

27:16.402 --> 27:18.337
but so far I've seen you
do lots of great ghosting stuff.

27:18.437 --> 27:24.443
Like that pizza thing and...
I like those sneakers.

27:24.543 --> 27:26.612
- People, we have a problem.

27:26.713 --> 27:29.015
What is...Never mind.

27:29.115 --> 27:31.050
I was checking
the security camera

27:31.150 --> 27:33.252
to see what happened to a big
plate of lemon squares I made

27:33.352 --> 27:35.788
and look what I saw.

27:35.888 --> 27:38.390
- Hank, you ate
the whole plate?

27:38.490 --> 27:42.729
- She put raspberries on them.
I'm not made of stone.

27:42.795 --> 27:45.832
- I'll just get...I'll just
get past the eating.

27:45.932 --> 27:47.800
[rewinding video]
Bear with me.

27:47.900 --> 27:49.836
So, are you guys
thinking of taking in

27:49.936 --> 27:51.804
any sights while
you're in town?

27:51.904 --> 27:53.639
Oh, wait, here it is.

27:53.740 --> 27:55.742
That's Chad, the boy
who's hosting

27:55.775 --> 27:57.543
the kids' Halloween party.

27:57.643 --> 27:59.211
- Why are his eyes glowing?

27:59.311 --> 28:01.213
- I've seen those eyes before.
That's the Green Ghoul.

28:01.313 --> 28:04.751
- He's possessing that kid.
- So he can go after our kids.

28:04.817 --> 28:06.185
I need the address
of that party.

28:06.285 --> 28:08.120
- Taylor left
the invitation on my desk.

28:08.220 --> 28:11.023
- I'm warning, Michele, catch!

28:11.123 --> 28:15.194
- No! No! No! No!
The locks!

28:15.294 --> 28:17.396
- I'll just hand
you the invite.

28:17.496 --> 28:18.998
* Drama queen

28:19.098 --> 28:22.301
- Not that I built this cage--
- He built it.

28:22.401 --> 28:24.203
- We built this cage
so only non-ghosts

28:24.303 --> 28:25.972
could open it from
the outside.

28:26.072 --> 28:28.775
We're all trapped.
- He built it.

28:28.875 --> 28:31.177
- [powers zapping]
You mean we can't get out?

28:31.277 --> 28:32.912
- We need to warn
the kids about Chad.

28:33.012 --> 28:34.847
- Don't worry,
the L chain is on it.

28:34.947 --> 28:37.349
To the party!
[powers whooshing]

28:41.553 --> 28:43.555
I'm havin' a bad day.

28:46.258 --> 28:50.396
- Dang it, I can't seem to get a
location on that second ghost.

28:50.496 --> 28:53.332
- In news that matters...

28:53.432 --> 28:55.201
I need to explain
that picture to Scott,

28:55.301 --> 28:56.803
but he's not answering
his phone, texts,

28:56.836 --> 28:57.904
or instant messages.

28:58.004 --> 29:01.340
- Have you tried
a carrier pigeon?

29:01.440 --> 29:03.810
- Very funny.

29:03.876 --> 29:06.979
Do you have one?

29:07.079 --> 29:08.280
- [zapper chirping]
- Wait!

29:08.380 --> 29:10.316
The Ghost Zapper's
got something.

29:10.416 --> 29:12.684
I think he's right...
over...

29:12.819 --> 29:15.988
- Hey!
- Oh, come on!

29:16.088 --> 29:17.356
- Louie, what are
you doing here?

29:17.456 --> 29:20.159
- Where's Myles
and your sister Jocelyn?

29:20.259 --> 29:24.330
- You mean Phoebe.
- Phoebe? Are you sure?

29:24.430 --> 29:26.833
- Louie.
- Right, we have a problem.

29:26.899 --> 29:29.268
- The Green Ghoul
is possessing Chad.

29:29.368 --> 29:33.139
- I knew there was something
weird about that kid.

29:33.239 --> 29:36.442
He liked Phoebe.
Always a red flag.

29:36.542 --> 29:38.577
- Chad took Phoebe
out to the courtyard.

29:38.677 --> 29:40.947
We have to warn her.

29:41.047 --> 29:43.115
- Who's Jocelyn?

29:46.718 --> 29:49.021
- Run! They look
five to one!

29:49.121 --> 29:51.891
- And there's lots
more people!

29:51.991 --> 29:53.625
How do we hold them off?

29:53.725 --> 29:54.861
- Attack!

29:54.961 --> 29:56.128
- Switch into defend mode.

29:56.228 --> 29:59.198
Throw them the apples
and non-sugar snacks.

30:05.905 --> 30:07.940
- This'll slow 'em down.
[powers zapping]

30:08.040 --> 30:12.311
- *

30:12.411 --> 30:14.146
- Or not.

30:18.450 --> 30:20.853
- Hey, whoa, tell me
where my sister is.

30:20.953 --> 30:22.488
- I don't know.

30:22.588 --> 30:24.723
I'm not even sure what
I'm doing out here.

30:24.823 --> 30:26.425
What the...?

30:26.525 --> 30:29.461
I was supposed to be dressed
as Ryan Seacrest.

30:29.561 --> 30:30.696
- Drop the act.

30:30.796 --> 30:33.900
- Max, wait, I don't think
the ghoul's in there any more.

30:34.000 --> 30:37.403
How would he know every year
Chad dresses as Ryan Seacrest?

30:37.503 --> 30:40.239
- That makes no sense.
- I know it sounds weird.

30:40.339 --> 30:42.241
But he puts on a blond
wig and skinny jeans

30:42.341 --> 30:44.276
and sorta pulls it off.

30:44.376 --> 30:46.678
- No, I meant why would
the ghoul leave?

30:46.778 --> 30:50.682
- I think I know why.

30:50.782 --> 30:53.352
- Did a talking bunny just pop
out of your backpack?

30:53.452 --> 30:58.590
- Oh, look, it's the girl
who's cheating on Scott.

30:58.690 --> 31:02.962
That's right.
Everybody's talking about it.

31:03.062 --> 31:04.830
- How dare you!
I would never--

31:04.931 --> 31:07.733
- Talk to the paw,
girlfriend.

31:07.833 --> 31:11.370
- Guys, enough.
We need to find Phoebe.

31:11.470 --> 31:14.106
- [Green Ghoul's voice]
I'm right here, brother.

31:14.206 --> 31:17.276
- Found her!

31:17.376 --> 31:18.510
- He's possessed Phoebe.

31:18.610 --> 31:21.113
- You're not going
anywhere, ghoul.

31:21.213 --> 31:23.182
- COLOSSO: Ow!

31:23.282 --> 31:24.850
- [Phoebe's voice]
Oh, come on, Max.

31:24.951 --> 31:26.986
You wouldn't hurt
your own sister.

31:27.086 --> 31:28.287
- Check the bite marks
on your ankle.

31:28.387 --> 31:30.656
They're mine
and they're recent.

31:30.756 --> 31:32.858
- [Green Ghoul's voice]
Fine, you wanna play.

31:32.959 --> 31:34.793
Let's play!

31:34.961 --> 31:37.964
- Okay, that voice does
not go with that blouse.

31:38.030 --> 31:40.199
- [powers whooshing]

31:40.299 --> 31:42.668
- Well, that wasn't
very nice.

31:42.768 --> 31:45.604
Guess I'll just have to take
you down old-school style.

31:45.704 --> 31:49.208
Step back.

31:49.308 --> 31:51.277

32:12.064 --> 32:14.900
- [Green Ghoul's voice] You're
braver than I thought, Max.

32:15.001 --> 32:18.270
How about you join me in taking
down your old man?

32:18.370 --> 32:20.239
- I don't think so, ghoul.

32:20.339 --> 32:22.741
- Now hang on.
Let's hear him out.

32:22.841 --> 32:24.643
It's only polite.

32:28.047 --> 32:32.384
- I thought I sensed
the darkness in you, Max.

32:32.484 --> 32:34.386
I could have shaped you
into a true villain.

32:34.486 --> 32:35.921
But I guess you're just a...

32:36.022 --> 32:38.457
pretender!

- [muffled groaning]

by the Green Ghoul.

32:51.203 --> 32:54.040
- Thanks for the newsflash.

32:54.073 --> 32:55.341
- Max, are you okay?

32:55.441 --> 32:57.143
You have a cut
on your lip.

32:57.243 --> 32:59.045
- Oh, does Max
have a boo-boo?

32:59.111 --> 33:02.448
I was frozen!

33:02.548 --> 33:04.050
- Myles, you need to poof
back to the bakery

33:04.083 --> 33:06.518
and warn Thunderman that the
Green Ghoul's coming for him.

33:06.618 --> 33:09.288
- On it.
[snaps fingers]

33:09.388 --> 33:10.789
I can't poof.

33:10.889 --> 33:12.858
Being frozen must have messed
with my ghost powers.

33:12.958 --> 33:18.130
Ha, life of a sidekick,
am I right?

33:18.230 --> 33:20.399
- Taylor?
- Uh, Scott?

33:20.499 --> 33:23.535
- Busted!

33:23.635 --> 33:25.404
- What are you doing here?

33:25.504 --> 33:27.573
- I saw a picture of you holding
hands with a guy--

33:27.673 --> 33:29.808
that guy!
- I can explain.

33:29.908 --> 33:31.877
This is just a huge
misunderstanding.

33:31.977 --> 33:33.479
- Really?

33:33.579 --> 33:35.481
I mean, I do get
confused a lot, but...

33:35.581 --> 33:38.217
this does not look good.

33:38.317 --> 33:39.718
- You can stay here,
but I've gotta go

33:39.818 --> 33:43.389
take care of the problem
back at the bakery.

33:43.489 --> 33:47.093
- I need to go.
Max, wait, I'm coming with you!

33:47.193 --> 33:49.961
I swear he means
nothing to me.

33:50.096 --> 33:53.299
Max!

33:53.399 --> 33:56.102
- Still very confused.

34:02.541 --> 34:04.643
- Oh, Phoebe, you're okay.

34:04.743 --> 34:06.112
- [Phoebe's voice]
Of course, I'm okay.

34:06.178 --> 34:09.915
I'm totally groovy, as the kids
in modern society say.

34:10.015 --> 34:11.850
- Phoebe, we accidentally
got stuck in here.

34:11.950 --> 34:13.785
Let me out so I can
head off the Green Ghoul.

34:13.885 --> 34:16.455
- Sure, Dad.
Let me get that for you.

34:16.555 --> 34:19.425
[laughing]

34:19.525 --> 34:20.892
- Oh!

34:20.992 --> 34:24.596
To clarify, sweetie,
I think he meant all of us.

34:24.696 --> 34:27.433
- Phoebe, you feeling okay?

34:27.533 --> 34:29.000
- [Green Ghoul's voice]
Never better.

34:29.135 --> 34:33.472
I'm about to do what I've been
dreaming about for 20 years.

34:33.572 --> 34:37.743
- Oh, the teen years,
am I right?

34:37.843 --> 34:39.145
- You're the Green Ghoul.

34:39.211 --> 34:42.981
- Just like old times,
eh, Thunderman.

34:43.149 --> 34:47.686
[powers roaring]

34:47.786 --> 34:53.659
- Cage stayed up.
That's all me.

34:53.759 --> 34:55.561
- Leave my daughter
out of this.

34:55.661 --> 34:57.429
Come out and fight me
face-to-face.

34:57.529 --> 35:00.532
- Sorry, can't do that.

35:00.632 --> 35:03.835
Ghost powers...

35:03.935 --> 35:05.471
plus superpowers...

35:05.571 --> 35:07.072
[powers whooshing]

35:07.173 --> 35:12.978
equals unstoppable!
[evil laughter]

35:15.681 --> 35:18.184
- Look, a marshmallow bird.

35:18.217 --> 35:22.588
- Oh, there will be
no winners tonight.

35:22.688 --> 35:24.390
- I guess it's game over.

35:24.490 --> 35:27.259
Frankie, it's been a pleasure
serving with you.

35:27.359 --> 35:29.628
- You, as well.

35:29.728 --> 35:35.301
In fact, I want you
to have my mask.

35:35.401 --> 35:38.204
- Nah, I'm good.

35:39.838 --> 35:43.375
- Did somebody call
for a hero?

35:43.475 --> 35:46.512
- What? No.
We're giving up.

35:46.612 --> 35:48.079
- No, you're not.

35:48.214 --> 35:50.216
Frankie, you're supposed
to be my best friend.

35:50.249 --> 35:52.484
But tonight, instead
of believing in me,

35:52.584 --> 35:53.819
you turned your back on me.

35:53.919 --> 35:55.687
I believe it was the dad
from Full House

35:55.787 --> 35:58.790
who once wisely said--
- [loud smack]

35:58.890 --> 36:02.661
- Can you please
get to the point.

36:02.761 --> 36:05.864
- My point is--despite your
complete lack of faith in me,

36:05.964 --> 36:07.999
I have come
to save the day.

36:08.099 --> 36:10.669
Form of a flying saucer!

36:10.769 --> 36:13.272
Please don't be
a princess dress!

36:13.372 --> 36:16.642
Please don't
be a princess dress!

36:16.742 --> 36:18.910
Yes!

36:19.010 --> 36:23.315
Now stand back and let
me do my thing.

36:23.415 --> 36:25.617
- Whoa, it's a UFO!

36:25.717 --> 36:29.755
- It's definitely not a ghost
where that is concerned.

36:29.855 --> 36:31.490
- Hear me, Earthlings.

36:31.590 --> 36:37.062
Surrender your candy or face
my intergalactic wrath.

36:37.162 --> 36:39.731
- Candy-stealing alien!

36:39.831 --> 36:43.735
- LOUIE: [shouting]

36:43.835 --> 36:46.272
- He did it!
He's saving our loot!

36:46.305 --> 36:49.375
Louie, wait, don't go yet.
There's something I need to say.

36:49.475 --> 36:50.542
- What's that?

36:50.642 --> 36:52.411
- FRANKIE: You were right.
I should have listened.

36:52.511 --> 36:55.447
I was a bad friend,
but you still had my back.

36:55.547 --> 36:56.715
I'm sorry!

36:56.815 --> 37:00.986
- LOUIE: I can't hear you...

37:01.086 --> 37:02.754
- He doesn't know how to control
that thing, does he?

37:02.854 --> 37:05.123
- Not even a little.

37:07.426 --> 37:09.461
- [Green Ghoul's voice]
Don't worry, Thunderman.

37:09.561 --> 37:13.098
I'll make this as painful as
possible for you.

37:13.198 --> 37:14.733
- HANK: [gasping]

37:14.833 --> 37:16.535
- BARB: [screams]
My husband!

37:16.635 --> 37:18.103
- My coffee table!

37:18.203 --> 37:20.506
I mean--your husband!

37:20.606 --> 37:22.641
- HANK: [thudding]

37:22.741 --> 37:27.178
- Yo, Hank, any time you wanna
use those superpowers, big guy.

37:27.313 --> 37:28.414
- He can do what
he wants to me.

37:28.514 --> 37:31.016
I'm not gonna fight
my daughter.

37:31.116 --> 37:33.852
- MAX: How about
you fight your son?

37:33.952 --> 37:36.322
- Max, what are you doing?

37:36.422 --> 37:39.057
- Proving I'm no pretend
supervillain.

37:39.157 --> 37:40.692
You said I have
potential, ghoul.

37:40.792 --> 37:42.894
I'm ready to learn
from the best.

37:42.994 --> 37:45.130
- You're joining
the Green Ghoul?

37:45.230 --> 37:48.367
But he's an ugly, vile,
sub-creature.

37:48.467 --> 37:51.503
- [Green Ghoul's voice]
Uh, standing right here.

37:51.603 --> 37:54.105
If you're truly
ready to embrace evil,

37:54.205 --> 37:56.375
then you won't mind,
if I hurl your father

37:56.475 --> 37:59.845
into the farthest reaches
of the Universe.

37:59.945 --> 38:02.914
- [wind gusting]
- [doors slam open]

38:03.014 --> 38:05.884
- Nope, all good.
Let it rip.

38:05.984 --> 38:07.853
- Max.

38:07.953 --> 38:10.456
- I told you, Dad.
This is who I am.

38:10.556 --> 38:12.157
But before you go,
you should know one thing--

38:12.257 --> 38:13.925
I'd never turn
against you.

38:14.025 --> 38:15.494
[powers whooshing]

38:15.594 --> 38:18.096
Myles, now!
- Myles, what are you doing?

38:18.196 --> 38:19.565
- Fighting for justice.

38:19.665 --> 38:22.000
My powers are back!

38:22.100 --> 38:24.670
- Stop it!
Get out of there!

38:24.770 --> 38:27.873
Two ghosts possessing the same
thing is way too dangerous!

38:27.973 --> 38:29.240
- MYLES: I can do this!

38:29.375 --> 38:34.179
[powers whooshing]

38:34.279 --> 38:36.982
- Phoebe!
Is that you?

38:37.082 --> 38:39.117
- I could have been hanging

38:39.217 --> 38:41.453
at a sweet Halloween party
back home, but, no...

38:41.553 --> 38:44.089
- Yeah, that's her.
That's her.

38:44.189 --> 38:46.492
- Mom, are you okay?
- I'm fine.

38:46.592 --> 38:48.226
- Good, because you will
never believe my night.

38:48.394 --> 38:49.961
This girl, Amanda, took
a picture of me and Max.

38:50.061 --> 38:51.663
Now Scott thinks--
- Later, sweetie.

38:51.763 --> 38:55.000
After we're sure the evil ghost
villain is out of the house.

38:55.100 --> 38:56.768
- [powers whooshing]

38:56.868 --> 38:57.936
[evil laughter]

38:58.036 --> 39:00.205
Oh, I'm not going anywhere!

39:00.305 --> 39:02.140
- You're outnumbered.
Get in the ghost cage.

39:02.240 --> 39:03.875
- Who's gonna make me?

39:03.975 --> 39:06.512
I'm the Green Ghoul!

39:06.612 --> 39:10.081
You're just a sad collection
of ex-superheroes

39:10.181 --> 39:13.318
low level ghosting.

39:13.419 --> 39:16.488
I'm not even sure
who you are.

39:16.588 --> 39:17.689
- A single mom trying
to make it on her own

39:17.789 --> 39:21.026
in a new city,
thank you very much!

39:21.126 --> 39:22.994
- HANK: He's still got
ghost powers.

39:23.094 --> 39:24.195
- Not if he can't snap.

39:24.295 --> 39:26.865
I got this.

39:26.965 --> 39:29.300
- [powers whooshing]

39:29.435 --> 39:31.570
- I can't...hold him...
much longer.

39:31.670 --> 39:34.440
- Phoebe, do a freeze path.
- What? Max!

39:34.473 --> 39:36.341
If our two paths touch,
we'll freeze the whole city.

39:36.442 --> 39:38.444
- Then don't let them touch.

39:38.477 --> 39:41.346
- BOTH: [powers whooshing]

39:41.447 --> 39:46.117
- ALL: [cheering]

39:46.217 --> 39:47.619
- [powers zapping]

39:47.719 --> 39:49.621
That's for messing
with my husband!

39:49.721 --> 39:51.823
- This is for
my coffee table!

39:51.923 --> 39:53.324
- [loud thud]

39:53.459 --> 39:56.261
- Let's put him
in the cage.

39:56.361 --> 39:58.530
- BOTH: [straining]

39:58.630 --> 40:00.198
- Man, he...he's heavy.

40:00.298 --> 40:02.768
- I got this. Stand back.

40:08.540 --> 40:10.208
Back to prison, Ghoul!

40:10.308 --> 40:12.578
- [statue shatters]

40:12.678 --> 40:16.782
- GREEN GHOUL:
Noooooooooooo!

40:16.882 --> 40:19.485
- Now I see why Thunderman
is your number one hero.

40:19.585 --> 40:21.453
- Come on, Pops, I never
said number one.

40:21.553 --> 40:23.689
That spot's always
been taken.

40:23.789 --> 40:24.956
- Aw...

40:25.056 --> 40:26.992
- Hey, is that the buzzer
from my board game?

40:27.092 --> 40:28.760
- Shhhh!

40:28.860 --> 40:29.795
- That was incredible!

40:29.895 --> 40:33.064
You kids were amazing!
True superheroes!

40:33.164 --> 40:34.265
- Thanks, Dad.

40:34.365 --> 40:36.434
- Max, I know you don't
like the hero word.

40:36.535 --> 40:39.070
But I was wrong to think you
couldn't handle yourself.

40:39.170 --> 40:42.340
You can. I'm sorry.

40:42.440 --> 40:47.779
- All hail the Green Ghoul!

40:47.879 --> 40:51.382
I mean, I knew you
could do it, buddy.

40:51.483 --> 40:52.984
- FRANKIE: We're back.

40:53.084 --> 40:57.222
Whaddup,
Capt'n Lightning Bolt?

40:57.322 --> 40:59.825
- Best Halloween ever!

40:59.925 --> 41:01.660
- Candy, here I come.

41:01.760 --> 41:04.429
- I don't wanna be modest,
so I won't.

41:04.530 --> 41:06.698
Louie Preston
saved the day.

41:06.798 --> 41:08.133
Again.

41:08.233 --> 41:10.536
Now, Billy, open up this cage
so we can protect our candy.

41:10.636 --> 41:13.238
- OTHERS: Noooo!
- Fine.

41:13.338 --> 41:15.674
* Drama queens

41:22.280 --> 41:23.882
- Well, I've gotta say--

41:23.982 --> 41:26.084
if I ever need a sidekick
the Polarizing Phantom

41:26.184 --> 41:27.919
is gonna be my first call.

41:28.019 --> 41:30.922
- Or you can summon me
by illuminating

41:31.022 --> 41:34.425
a huge bulls-eye
signal in the sky.

41:34.560 --> 41:38.296
- Calling is
probably easier.

41:38.396 --> 41:39.898
- Come on, Taylor, cheer up.

41:39.998 --> 41:41.767
We took down the Green Ghoul
tonight, remember?

41:41.867 --> 41:44.970
- Yeah, and I might have lost
a guy in the process--

41:45.070 --> 41:46.471
a really good guy.

41:46.572 --> 41:50.341
He's a member of PAPPF.

41:50.441 --> 41:51.610
- [door bells ringing]
- Taylor?

41:51.710 --> 41:53.144
- Scott, oh, my gosh,
we need to talk.

41:53.244 --> 41:56.014
- Yeah, we do.
What the heck is going on?

41:56.114 --> 41:57.816
Uh, sorry for cursing.

41:57.916 --> 41:59.785
- Will you just
let me explain.

41:59.885 --> 42:02.020
The truth is these guys
are super--

42:02.120 --> 42:05.090
old friends from Sweden.

42:05.190 --> 42:09.828
- [fake Swedish accent]
Yeah, I lika the meatballs.

42:09.928 --> 42:14.900
- [laughing]
Welcome to our country.

42:15.000 --> 42:17.102
That still doesn't explain
why you ran off with this guy.

42:17.202 --> 42:20.471
- It's because I lied
to her, okay?

42:20.606 --> 42:21.940
I told her there
was an emergency

42:22.040 --> 42:24.810
and I had to take her home,
but the truth is

42:24.910 --> 42:27.713
I was trying to keep her away
from you because...

42:27.813 --> 42:29.848
I like her.
- What?

42:29.948 --> 42:33.619
- Yeah, but the whole night, all
she could talk about was you--

42:33.719 --> 42:37.288
how cool Scott is,
how funny Scott is.

42:37.388 --> 42:38.990
She's really into you, dude.

42:39.090 --> 42:41.359
You can't blame me for
trying, right?

42:44.830 --> 42:46.632
- You said all
that stuff about me?

42:46.698 --> 42:48.533
- Sure.

42:48.634 --> 42:52.470
Can you give
me a second?

42:52.638 --> 42:54.205
Thanks.

42:54.305 --> 42:56.307
Maybe you're not such
a bad guy, after all.

42:56.407 --> 42:57.843
- Hey, keep that
to yourself.

42:57.943 --> 43:01.112
I have a reputation
to uphold.

43:03.514 --> 43:05.250
- Hey, so, what happened?

43:05.350 --> 43:08.754
Did Scott dump Taylor?
Gimme the deets.

43:08.854 --> 43:11.823
- No, I told him what
happened and...

43:11.923 --> 43:13.391
they're gonna stay together.

- Ach!

43:14.893 --> 43:17.829

43:24.069 --> 43:25.070
treat!

43:25.170 --> 43:28.506
[chuckling]

43:28.674 --> 43:30.475
Come on. I'll be good!
