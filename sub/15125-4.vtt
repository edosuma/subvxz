WEBVTT

00:04.605 --> 00:05.906
Ugh!

00:05.939 --> 00:08.076
Work gave us these
stupid smartphones,

00:08.109 --> 00:09.677
and I don't know how to use it.

00:09.710 --> 00:11.479
FEMALE VOICE:
How can I help you?

00:11.512 --> 00:13.047
I told you, stop calling me.

00:13.081 --> 00:14.482
You have the wrong number.

00:14.515 --> 00:17.185
Leave my wife alone.

00:17.218 --> 00:18.886
You'd like to leave your wife?

00:18.919 --> 00:21.255
Searching for divorce attorneys
in your area.

00:21.289 --> 00:23.691
That's not what I said,
home wrecker!

00:23.724 --> 00:26.360
Guys, guys, guys,
that's not a person.

00:26.394 --> 00:27.995
It's an automated
personal assistant.

00:28.028 --> 00:29.897
When you figure out
all the cool stuff

00:29.930 --> 00:31.565
that phone does,
you're gonna love it.

00:31.599 --> 00:33.367
Yeah, that's what our
manager at work said.

00:33.401 --> 00:36.270
And then she hit us with a ton
of new corporate policies.

00:36.304 --> 00:39.340
They want us to take pictures
of the houses we clean.

00:39.373 --> 00:41.375
Which means they don't trust us.

00:41.409 --> 00:44.612
Which sucks 'cause now we have
to really clean the houses.

00:44.645 --> 00:47.248
Well, at least you got
a cool new phone out of it.

00:47.281 --> 00:49.217
I hate it.
It's too complicated.

00:49.250 --> 00:51.552
I butt-dialed Burt three times
on the way to work.

00:51.585 --> 00:53.387
Your butt makes up for
in appearance

00:53.421 --> 00:55.123
what it lacks
in communication skills.

00:56.224 --> 00:57.291
MAW MAW:
That's pretty impressive.

00:57.325 --> 00:59.593
My butt has only two tricks.

00:59.627 --> 01:01.129
One is, uh, disgusting,

01:01.162 --> 01:04.398
and the other
is looking amazing in jeans.

01:05.466 --> 01:07.135
Mmm. Now that you
have a new phone,

01:07.168 --> 01:08.402
you can follow me
on WikiVids.

01:08.436 --> 01:09.903
What's WikiVids?

01:09.937 --> 01:12.072
It's a site where I post videos
of the eggs I make

01:12.106 --> 01:14.074
and my funny little
comments about them.

01:14.108 --> 01:16.877
I kind of interpret
what they look like.

01:16.910 --> 01:18.479
I call this one "Yolko Ono."

01:18.512 --> 01:20.448
See how the egg
broke up the hash browns?

01:20.481 --> 01:21.949
MAW MAW:
Oh, look at that.

01:21.982 --> 01:23.251
Now, that is art.

01:23.284 --> 01:24.618
You should open
up a museum

01:24.652 --> 01:26.487
where you bring these out
to people,

01:26.520 --> 01:28.256
and then they get to eat it.

01:28.289 --> 01:30.591
Isn't that just
a restaurant?

01:30.624 --> 01:32.626
Everything's been done!

01:32.660 --> 01:34.895
You know, if you hate
your phone so much,

01:34.928 --> 01:36.130
we could switch phones.

01:36.164 --> 01:37.565
My flip phone
takes lousy pictures,

01:37.598 --> 01:39.099
so you don't have
to clean that good.

01:39.133 --> 01:40.334
Yeah, I guess
we could do...

01:40.368 --> 01:41.669
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

01:41.702 --> 01:43.304
He wants something from us.

01:43.337 --> 01:44.938
We should get something
in return.

01:44.972 --> 01:46.307
You thinking "Pick-a-Pocket,
Pick-a-Pocket,

01:46.340 --> 01:47.975
We Want Everything
in Your Pockets"?

01:48.008 --> 01:49.343
It's a good day for it.
Jimmy's wearing cargo pants.

01:49.377 --> 01:50.744
Ooh, can we
make him jump?

01:50.778 --> 01:52.680
No, no, no, no, no,
you know the rules.

01:52.713 --> 01:55.616
One turn, one pocket,
no touching, no whining.

01:55.649 --> 01:57.285
BURT:
I-I'm gonna go...

01:57.318 --> 01:59.119
right... left...

01:59.153 --> 02:00.120
right... left...

02:00.154 --> 02:01.822
Right front!

02:04.625 --> 02:07.027
Oh, damn, we were
getting that anyway.

02:07.060 --> 02:08.629
What was in the other pockets?

02:10.831 --> 02:12.800
ALL:
Keys!

02:15.303 --> 02:17.137
Wallet!

02:18.071 --> 02:19.340
Fruit pie!

02:19.373 --> 02:21.909
Oh, man,
we could have had a fruit pie!

02:23.076 --> 02:25.012
Whoo!

02:25.045 --> 02:26.547
* Here we go

02:26.580 --> 02:29.550
* Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

02:29.583 --> 02:32.620
I want another roll.

02:32.653 --> 02:34.822
Sorry, Maw Maw,
I didn't make enough

02:34.855 --> 02:36.724
for both of you to have two.

02:36.757 --> 02:38.359
You're gonna have
to split it with Hope.

02:38.392 --> 02:40.328
You know, there's a lot
of really great stuff

02:40.361 --> 02:41.829
in these new
corporate policies.

02:41.862 --> 02:43.063
I mean, a week's

02:43.096 --> 02:44.632
paid vacation,
Oh!

02:44.665 --> 02:46.367
401(k)...

02:46.400 --> 02:47.835
401(k)?

02:47.868 --> 02:49.837
No, thanks.

02:49.870 --> 02:51.539
I ran a 5K once
and almost puked.

02:51.572 --> 02:52.706
(chuckles)

02:52.740 --> 02:54.842
Oh, hey, you get health care.

02:54.875 --> 02:56.644
Actually, it says
spouses are covered, too.

02:56.677 --> 02:58.679
You guys could finally go
to the doctor.

02:58.712 --> 03:00.147
We're not sick.

03:00.180 --> 03:01.349
You don't have to be sick
to go to the doctor.

03:01.382 --> 03:02.983
(both laugh)

03:03.016 --> 03:04.918
Why would you go to a doctor
if you're not sick?

03:04.952 --> 03:06.220
Like, to say hello?

03:06.254 --> 03:07.521
Hello, Doctor.

03:07.555 --> 03:09.390
Hello, Burt. How are you?

03:09.423 --> 03:10.591
Not sick.

03:10.624 --> 03:12.593
Wonderful.
Thanks for stopping by.

03:12.626 --> 03:14.228
(Burt and Virginia laughing)

03:19.400 --> 03:21.369
Fine.

03:21.402 --> 03:24.037
Enjoy the carbs, fatso.

03:24.071 --> 03:26.374
Guys, you have to get checkups.

03:26.407 --> 03:28.108
Otherwise little things,
they turn into big things.

03:28.141 --> 03:31.044
It only takes one spark
to burn down the whole forest.

03:31.078 --> 03:34.047
The only doctor I go to
is Dr. Vajajay.

03:35.215 --> 03:36.384
He's Indian.
That's his name.

03:36.417 --> 03:37.885
He looks after my hoo-hah.

03:37.918 --> 03:39.019
Gross.

03:39.052 --> 03:41.289
I assure you, it is not.

03:42.756 --> 03:47.528
JIMMY:
Okay, this is LeBron James
and the Giant Peach.

03:47.561 --> 03:49.096
What are you doing?

03:49.129 --> 03:50.798
I'm gonna make videos
of fruits and vegetables

03:50.831 --> 03:52.633
made to look
like famous athletes.

03:52.666 --> 03:54.702
I've got Wayne Grapesky,

03:54.735 --> 03:56.069
Pear Bryant.

03:56.103 --> 03:58.105
Uh, I'm trying to think
of a baseball player

03:58.138 --> 03:59.873
I could use for strawberries,
but...

03:59.907 --> 04:01.208
nothing's coming to me.

04:01.241 --> 04:03.110
Don't you think
it's a little derivative?

04:03.143 --> 04:04.445
No, it's a big peach.

04:04.478 --> 04:06.580
I mean it's not very original.

04:06.614 --> 04:08.416
I do food.

04:08.449 --> 04:09.717
You're just copying my idea.

04:09.750 --> 04:12.653
So?
It's just a silly video thing.

04:12.686 --> 04:14.054
A silly video thing?

04:14.087 --> 04:16.290
(chuckles)
I think the 28 people

04:16.324 --> 04:18.258
who follow
"Sabrina's Yolk of the Day"

04:18.292 --> 04:19.793
might disagree with you.

04:21.929 --> 04:24.064
Wait a minute.

04:24.097 --> 04:26.400
Strawberry Bonds.

04:26.434 --> 04:28.369
Oh, how dumb am I?

04:31.505 --> 04:33.907
What's going on
with your toe freckle?

04:33.941 --> 04:35.242
I'm not sure.

04:35.275 --> 04:37.244
I'm worried it's
getting bigger.

04:37.277 --> 04:39.112
Maybe your toe's
getting smaller.

04:39.146 --> 04:41.181
Well, that
worries me, too.

04:41.214 --> 04:42.583
Either one of those things

04:42.616 --> 04:44.151
could be the spark
that starts the fire.

04:44.184 --> 04:46.186
That's what Sabrina said
about the doctor.

04:46.219 --> 04:48.789
I've been thinking
about that, too. Listen.

04:49.690 --> 04:51.158
(groans)

04:51.191 --> 04:53.327
(neck cracking)
(gasps)

04:53.361 --> 04:55.295
I think my neck crack's
getting worse.

04:55.329 --> 04:57.264
Sounds like someone's
making popcorn under my head.

04:57.297 --> 04:59.500
Sometimes my ear
just starts hurting.

04:59.533 --> 05:01.369
Like, I'll just be
standing somewhere,

05:01.402 --> 05:03.136
and then, suddenly, ow!

05:03.170 --> 05:04.171
Did it just happen?

05:04.204 --> 05:05.673
No, I was just dramatizing.

05:05.706 --> 05:07.608
It only happens a
couple times a week.

05:07.641 --> 05:09.209
You know what else?
Sometimes when I pee,

05:09.242 --> 05:10.678
it comes out
in two different directions.

05:10.711 --> 05:11.845
Zow! Zow!

05:11.879 --> 05:12.946
I'm dramatizing, too.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.682
My after-breakfast
eye twitch

05:14.715 --> 05:17.050
is now sometimes lasting
all the way till lunch.

05:17.084 --> 05:19.653
No matter how much coffee
I drink to relax myself,

05:19.687 --> 05:21.021
it just doesn't stop!

05:21.054 --> 05:23.624
My jaw hurts like crazy
when I go like this.

05:23.657 --> 05:26.326
Ooh, that
looks painful.
It is.

05:26.360 --> 05:28.962
I hate to say it,
but maybe Sabrina was right.

05:28.996 --> 05:30.297
We need to see a doctor.

05:30.330 --> 05:31.999
Maybe she was right
about other things.

05:32.032 --> 05:35.469
Do you really think there's
a country called Chad?

05:35.503 --> 05:38.071
Yeah, and everyone there
carries a a tennis racket

05:38.105 --> 05:40.340
and wears a sweater
tied around their shoulders.

05:40.374 --> 05:42.510
(both laugh)

05:46.346 --> 05:48.215
I'm starting
to get worried.

05:48.248 --> 05:50.017
I think I have
everything.

05:50.050 --> 05:51.385
Muscle weakness? Check.

05:51.419 --> 05:52.720
Fatigue? Check.

05:52.753 --> 05:55.055
Form of payment? Check.

05:55.088 --> 05:57.391
I know. Do I get dizzy?

05:57.425 --> 05:58.826
When you spin around a lot.

05:58.859 --> 06:00.027
Damn it!

06:01.462 --> 06:02.563
Virginia Chance?

06:02.596 --> 06:03.864
Nice to meet you.

06:04.732 --> 06:06.099
(laughing):
Gotcha!

06:06.133 --> 06:07.568
I love that one.

06:07.601 --> 06:09.403
Do it to all
my new patients.
(Virginia laughs)

06:09.437 --> 06:12.072
My philosophy is,
laughter is the best medicine.

06:12.105 --> 06:13.541
Unless you have
insurance.

06:13.574 --> 06:15.709
In that case,
medicine is the best medicine.

06:15.743 --> 06:17.110
(laughs)
Okay.

06:17.144 --> 06:19.379
Let's go look under your hood.

06:21.214 --> 06:22.983
(quietly):
Stay strong.

06:29.122 --> 06:32.192
Hey, guys, I don't usually
post spill videos, but...

06:32.225 --> 06:35.262
you don't see a crocodile with
Abe Lincoln's head every day.

06:35.295 --> 06:36.597
(laughter)

06:36.630 --> 06:38.799
Guys?

06:40.834 --> 06:42.269
All right, well,

06:42.302 --> 06:44.304
that was an amusing diversion,
but we should...

06:44.337 --> 06:46.474
Oh, you know what? We can
bleach the chicken tomorrow.

06:46.507 --> 06:48.041
Let's watch it again.

06:48.075 --> 06:50.243
You guys watching my daily
"Yolk of the Day" video?

06:50.277 --> 06:53.881
No. Jimmy posted
this hilarious new WikiVid.

06:53.914 --> 06:56.550
And you should probably get
your cholesterol checked.

06:56.584 --> 06:57.885
Let me see this.

06:57.918 --> 06:59.620
This better not be
food-related.

06:59.653 --> 07:01.388
MAW MAW:
I was never

07:01.421 --> 07:03.557
a fan of the Three Stooges.

07:03.591 --> 07:06.627
I found them sweaty and clumsy

07:06.660 --> 07:08.829
and not very entertaining.

07:08.862 --> 07:11.799
To be clear, the Three Stooges

07:11.832 --> 07:14.768
is what I called
Wilfrid's genitals.

07:14.802 --> 07:17.404
(laughter)

07:17.437 --> 07:19.406
FRANK:
Unless you are one,

07:19.439 --> 07:20.574
old people are funny.

07:20.608 --> 07:22.275
Yeah. I guess it's funny.

07:22.309 --> 07:23.744
It's a little simple.

07:23.777 --> 07:24.945
Simple?

07:24.978 --> 07:26.580
Yeah. I mean,
when you have as many

07:26.614 --> 07:28.982
as 27 followers,
they want you to challenge them

07:29.016 --> 07:30.751
artistically and intellectually.

07:30.784 --> 07:32.520
Oh, I thought you had 28.

07:32.553 --> 07:34.287
I did.

07:34.321 --> 07:35.823
I'm sorry, Sabrina,

07:35.856 --> 07:37.658
but between the nun
that does the chicken dance,

07:37.691 --> 07:39.426
the cat that plays the piano

07:39.459 --> 07:40.828
and James' hysterical
new videos,

07:40.861 --> 07:43.163
I don't have the time
to stare at eggs

07:43.196 --> 07:45.499
until they look
like Steve Buscemi.

07:45.533 --> 07:46.800
All done.

07:46.834 --> 07:48.702
Oh, you've gone blind.

07:48.736 --> 07:50.470
We should have
come sooner.

07:50.504 --> 07:52.339
I'm not blind.

07:52.372 --> 07:54.441
When they give you an eye exam,
they delete your pupils.

07:54.474 --> 07:57.210
But the good news is, the only
thing wrong with me is my eyes.

07:57.244 --> 07:58.378
Nothing glasses can't fix.

07:58.411 --> 08:00.147
It's just a slight
prescription.

08:00.180 --> 08:03.383
It... it'd be like going from
standard definition to high-def.

08:03.416 --> 08:05.953
And I'm sorry
you have to make such a...

08:05.986 --> 08:07.287
spectacle of yourself.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.156
(both laughing)

08:10.758 --> 08:12.325
He's a lot more funny
once you find out

08:12.359 --> 08:13.694
you're not dying.
You'll see.

08:26.106 --> 08:28.375
(phone beeps)

08:29.242 --> 08:31.411
MAW MAW:
Well,

08:31.444 --> 08:33.814
it took 87 years,

08:33.847 --> 08:38.418
but now, officially,
my neck looks like my vagina.

08:38.451 --> 08:40.353
(laughing)

08:40.387 --> 08:42.923
Her neck does look
like a vagina.

08:42.956 --> 08:45.225
(scoffs)
Where's Sabrina?
(chuckles)

08:45.258 --> 08:47.427
She took her, uh, break
a half hour ago.

08:47.460 --> 08:49.096
No fair, all right?

08:49.129 --> 08:51.364
You said that my video
was deflippititive,

08:51.398 --> 08:53.200
and now you're being
defibrilitive.

08:53.233 --> 08:55.402
I think the word you're
looking for is derivative.

08:55.435 --> 08:57.437
Whatever. All right,
if I can't film food,

08:57.470 --> 09:00.073
then you can't take advantage
of my crazy great-grandmother

09:00.107 --> 09:01.575
to amuse strangers.

09:01.609 --> 09:03.443
That's my thing.
Come on.

09:03.476 --> 09:05.345
You and I should both be able
to record whatever we want...

09:05.378 --> 09:06.546
Sounds like someone

09:06.580 --> 09:08.616
with 27 followers talking.

09:08.649 --> 09:09.783
(laughs)

09:09.817 --> 09:11.619
35. Thank you very much.

09:11.652 --> 09:14.054
Oh, 35. I remember
when I had 35 followers.

09:14.087 --> 09:17.224
That was... four followers ago.

09:18.125 --> 09:19.760
Oh, yeah?

09:19.793 --> 09:21.261
Well, your phone is pink.

09:21.294 --> 09:23.931
Yep. Whatever, 35.

09:25.899 --> 09:27.735
Well, everything
checks out-- your eyes,

09:27.768 --> 09:30.403
your heart, blood pressure.
You're in great shape.

09:30.437 --> 09:32.072
Well, that wasn't so bad.

09:32.105 --> 09:34.207
I might think about getting
a regular checkup

09:34.241 --> 09:35.643
every six or seven years.

09:35.676 --> 09:37.778
Some of those tests
were actually kind of fun.

09:37.811 --> 09:39.412
Do that little hammer again.

09:41.481 --> 09:42.750
(laughs)

09:42.783 --> 09:45.118
Wow! That is wild!

09:45.152 --> 09:47.420
Does that work
on other parts of the body, too?

09:47.454 --> 09:49.990
'Cause I could really use that
magic hammer in the bedroom.

09:50.023 --> 09:51.959
Just, uh, one more thing.

09:51.992 --> 09:55.395
Just turn around,
bend over and...

09:55.428 --> 09:57.430
promise you can keep a secret.

09:57.464 --> 09:59.499
All right.

10:00.868 --> 10:02.836
Whoa!

10:02.870 --> 10:05.438
And that feels like your finger
in my doggy door.

10:05.472 --> 10:07.340
Oh, it's just a routine test,
Burt.

10:07.374 --> 10:09.576
Well, if you're trying
to get my knee to move again,

10:09.609 --> 10:11.578
it's twitching pretty good,
so you can stop now.

10:11.611 --> 10:12.846
Hmm.

10:12.880 --> 10:16.016
Your prostate feels
a little... boggy.

10:16.049 --> 10:18.618
And your finger feels
a little biggy. Oh!

10:18.652 --> 10:20.921
How of... how often
do you have sex?

10:20.954 --> 10:22.522
Like this? Never.

10:22.555 --> 10:24.491
No, like, with your wife.

10:24.524 --> 10:27.494
Sex can be good
for your prostate.

10:27.527 --> 10:29.262
I'll keep that in mind.

10:29.296 --> 10:31.932
In the meantime,
I want to do a colonoscopy

10:31.965 --> 10:35.669
just to make sure this isn't
a sign of a larger problem.

10:35.703 --> 10:38.772
Fine. Can't be any worse
than what we're doing now.

10:38.806 --> 10:41.709
Well, we pass a fiber-optic
camera through your anus,

10:41.742 --> 10:43.476
and we have a little look-see.

10:43.510 --> 10:46.479
I stand corrected. (grunts)

10:52.152 --> 10:54.054
Whoa.

10:54.087 --> 10:55.989
I can't believe it.

10:56.023 --> 10:58.658
Everything's so clear.

10:58.692 --> 11:01.328
The birds, the clouds...

11:01.361 --> 11:04.464
I can even see that bus bench
all the way across the street.

11:04.497 --> 11:07.868
"50% off glasses
at Glasses Land."

11:07.901 --> 11:10.370
That would've been
nice to know an hour ago.

11:10.403 --> 11:12.239
Come on, the doctor
said I have to have

11:12.272 --> 11:13.807
more sex
to un-bog my colon.

11:13.841 --> 11:15.008
You got your prescription
filled; now it's my turn.

11:15.042 --> 11:16.576
He didn't actually
write it down,

11:16.609 --> 11:18.879
but I'm thinking twice
daily after meals.

11:18.912 --> 11:20.247
Here we go.

11:20.280 --> 11:23.416
I can't believe how clear
everything is.

11:23.450 --> 11:25.418
This is probably
what Helen Keller felt like

11:25.452 --> 11:27.520
when she got her glasses.

11:27.554 --> 11:29.189
(humming)

11:29.222 --> 11:30.724
This is the first test
I'm actually

11:30.758 --> 11:31.892
excited to study for.

11:31.925 --> 11:33.426
I wonder if this
is how they came up

11:33.460 --> 11:34.795
with the term
"cramming."

11:36.930 --> 11:38.698
VIRGINIA:
Whoa.

11:38.732 --> 11:40.233
We really need
to paint out here.

11:40.267 --> 11:41.401
Virginia...

11:41.434 --> 11:42.602
I'm sorry.

11:46.606 --> 11:47.674
Whoa.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.877
This carpet is really stained.

11:49.910 --> 11:51.244
Focus.

11:51.278 --> 11:52.780
Oh. Yeah...

12:04.591 --> 12:05.993
VIRGINIA:
Uh...

12:09.462 --> 12:11.464
Oh, that's
a banana peel.

12:11.498 --> 12:12.933
I thought it was my bracelet.

12:14.067 --> 12:15.568
Mmm...

12:17.670 --> 12:18.738
No.

12:18.772 --> 12:20.573
I can't have sex
in here, Burt.

12:20.607 --> 12:22.442
This house is disgusting.
Take the glasses off.

12:22.475 --> 12:23.610
Oh, good idea.

12:29.182 --> 12:30.617
No, I can't do this.

12:30.650 --> 12:32.820
I just keep imagining
everything I'm not seeing.

12:32.853 --> 12:35.288
Well, maybe you should
start focusing

12:35.322 --> 12:37.891
on what you are seeing.

12:37.925 --> 12:40.093
Oh, my God...
is that the face

12:40.127 --> 12:41.661
you make when you do
your sexy dance?

12:41.694 --> 12:45.732
Ah, these glasses are
ruining everything!

12:45.765 --> 12:47.700
Ah... (sighs)

12:50.637 --> 12:51.939
Oh, hey, Dad.

12:51.972 --> 12:53.340
How's it going?

12:53.373 --> 12:55.775
I got to drink a gallon
of laxative in an hour.

12:55.809 --> 12:57.677
On the plus side,

12:57.710 --> 12:59.412
I'm pretty sure
that buffalo nickel

12:59.446 --> 13:01.581
I swallowed in third grade
is finally gonna resurface.

13:01.614 --> 13:02.983
Okay, well...

13:03.016 --> 13:05.085
time to go see
if crazy Maw Maw

13:05.118 --> 13:06.553
can help me break
50 followers.

13:13.693 --> 13:15.428
Hey, uh, Maw Maw,

13:15.462 --> 13:18.331
you, uh, got anything stuck
in your craw today?

13:18.365 --> 13:21.034
No, I just cleaned my craw.

13:21.068 --> 13:22.635
Keep talking.

13:22.669 --> 13:23.837
(quick knock at door)

13:25.338 --> 13:26.874
(sniffs)

13:26.907 --> 13:28.842
Why does your bedroom smell
like my mother's breath?

13:28.876 --> 13:30.543
I found some wine
stains on the carpet,

13:30.577 --> 13:31.979
and I couldn't
get them out,

13:32.012 --> 13:33.313
so I'm gonna make it look like

13:33.346 --> 13:34.982
one of those Jackson Polack
paintings.

13:35.015 --> 13:37.484
Sure, that's one way
of doing it.

13:37.517 --> 13:39.052
With these damn glasses,

13:39.086 --> 13:41.855
I notice every little
imperfection around the house.

13:41.889 --> 13:43.456
Hand me that green
magic marker.

13:43.490 --> 13:45.692
I saw a plant outside
that needs a touch-up.

13:45.725 --> 13:48.028
That sounds very sensible.

13:52.432 --> 13:54.935
SABRINA (whispering):
Virginia obsessively cleaning,
take one.

13:56.937 --> 13:58.271
(crickets chirping)

14:01.041 --> 14:03.510
That's a little better.

14:04.411 --> 14:06.546
That could work.

14:08.781 --> 14:10.817
Ready!

14:10.850 --> 14:13.020
Oh.

14:13.053 --> 14:14.654
Shut the door. It looks
like it's snowing in here--

14:14.687 --> 14:15.655
there's so much dust

14:15.688 --> 14:17.657
floating in the air.
Ooh.

14:17.690 --> 14:19.526
I'd say take the glasses off,

14:19.559 --> 14:22.495
but the whole Sarah Palin thing
is really working for me.

14:22.529 --> 14:25.398
(chuckles)
Can you tell me
about a moose you shot?

14:25.432 --> 14:27.400
(growling)

14:27.434 --> 14:29.502
Ooh. Someone's in the mood.

14:29.536 --> 14:30.938
No, that's my stomach.

14:30.971 --> 14:32.772
I think
the pre-colonoscopy beverage

14:32.805 --> 14:35.175
is doing something crazy
to my... Uh-oh.
(stomach grumbling)

14:35.208 --> 14:36.376
(grunts)

14:36.409 --> 14:37.444
Hot soup!

14:37.477 --> 14:40.513
(moaning)

14:40.547 --> 14:41.949
(shouts)

14:41.982 --> 14:44.151
It's like I ate
a waterfall!

14:45.418 --> 14:47.354
Look at this.
First thing this morning,

14:47.387 --> 14:49.589
and I've already got
three new followers.

14:49.622 --> 14:50.690
Thank God you're here.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.059
I need a ride to the hospital.

14:52.092 --> 14:53.460
I did not want to use this sign.

14:53.493 --> 14:55.062
Where's Virginia?
(gasps)

14:55.095 --> 14:56.696
Please tell me she's
obsessively cleaning something.

14:56.729 --> 14:58.231
She's locked herself
in our bedroom.

14:58.265 --> 14:59.299
Jackpot.

14:59.332 --> 15:01.568
Last chance, Virginia!

15:01.601 --> 15:03.870
Just need another minute!

15:03.903 --> 15:06.473
I can't go out in public
looking like this.

15:06.506 --> 15:10.210
(knocking)
SABRINA:
Hey, Virginia. Open up!

15:10.243 --> 15:11.611
Saw some brown
leaves outside

15:11.644 --> 15:13.313
that could use a
fresh coat of paint.

15:13.346 --> 15:15.415
Oh, dang.

15:15.448 --> 15:17.684
Hey, I-I just want
to stick my arm in.

15:18.986 --> 15:21.288
Hey, Maw Maw.

15:21.321 --> 15:22.322
Obama's a genius.

15:22.355 --> 15:23.556
And... go.

15:23.590 --> 15:24.924
You're not filming me anymore.

15:24.958 --> 15:26.293
I know what you're up to.

15:26.326 --> 15:28.561
MAW MAW:
Yesterday, I was at Howdy's.

15:28.595 --> 15:30.663
(laughing)

15:30.697 --> 15:32.732
JIMMY:
Maw Maw, tell me
what happened next.

15:32.765 --> 15:37.104
So I told Rosa Parks
I couldn't move over

15:37.137 --> 15:39.739
because I had
all these shopping bags.

15:39.772 --> 15:40.773
(chuckles)

15:40.807 --> 15:42.275
Who knew she was gonna turn it

15:42.309 --> 15:43.743
into such a big to-do?

15:43.776 --> 15:45.478
(laughs)
(snickers)
Hey.

15:45.512 --> 15:47.514
Hey, that crazy,
wrinkled old bitty

15:47.547 --> 15:49.016
is stealing all my stories.

15:49.049 --> 15:51.985
In my bathtub,
wearing my shower cap!

15:52.019 --> 15:54.687
Wait a minute.
I know what's going on.

15:54.721 --> 15:56.356
Somebo...

15:56.389 --> 15:58.491
Oh, crap. Lost it.

16:00.393 --> 16:03.530
Tell me what's going on.

16:03.563 --> 16:05.198
They told me everything.

16:05.232 --> 16:06.766
I'm cutting you off.

16:06.799 --> 16:08.201
(sighs)
Come on, Maw Maw.

16:08.235 --> 16:09.769
I've got nothing else to film.

16:09.802 --> 16:11.204
All right, Jimmy, let's go.

16:11.238 --> 16:12.772
I don't want to miss
my appointment

16:12.805 --> 16:14.174
and go through that prep again.

16:14.207 --> 16:15.942
At the end there,
I was pooping out cereals

16:15.975 --> 16:18.478
they haven't made
since the '70s.

16:24.217 --> 16:26.619
I do not like the idea
of this one bit.

16:26.653 --> 16:28.821
The smallest camera
I've ever seen was on a watch,

16:28.855 --> 16:31.191
and that would
still scrape going in.
Yeah, well, just

16:31.224 --> 16:33.960
think of it as a medical
device, not as a camera.

16:33.993 --> 16:36.329
It's just a little tube
that's five feet long.

16:36.363 --> 16:38.965
"In the unlikely event
of death..."

16:38.998 --> 16:40.800
Oh, my God.

16:40.833 --> 16:42.135
Doc!

16:42.169 --> 16:43.803
This says I could die.

16:43.836 --> 16:45.172
You didn't tell me that.

16:45.205 --> 16:46.539
That's just the disclaimer

16:46.573 --> 16:47.907
for anyone going
under general anesthetic.

16:47.940 --> 16:49.676
Don't worry, Burt.

16:49.709 --> 16:52.479
Only one out of every 10,000
people dies while they're under.

16:52.512 --> 16:53.580
How many of these have you done?

16:53.613 --> 16:54.747
About 10,000.

16:54.781 --> 16:55.982
Never had a problem.

16:56.015 --> 16:58.151
(groans)
Jimmy...

16:58.185 --> 17:00.820
he's overdue for a death.

17:00.853 --> 17:03.090
It's gonna be me. I can feel it.

17:03.123 --> 17:05.058
Get me the hell out of here.

17:05.092 --> 17:07.394
I don't want to die
with a camera up my poop chute.

17:07.427 --> 17:09.396
Dad, it says "unlikely."

17:09.429 --> 17:12.899
"Unlikely"? Unlikely things
happen all the time.

17:12.932 --> 17:14.601
Michael Jordan grew
a Hitler mustache.

17:14.634 --> 17:16.703
That came out of nowhere.
Nowhere!

17:16.736 --> 17:19.539
Jimmy Chance has done it again.

17:27.647 --> 17:29.249
It can't be that bad.

17:29.282 --> 17:31.384
(sighs)

17:31.418 --> 17:32.852
(gasps)
Ooh. That's not good.

17:32.885 --> 17:35.222
Can I pop it? Just...
No!
(groans)

17:35.255 --> 17:38.258
Ever since I got these glasses,
they've just made my life worse.

17:39.459 --> 17:41.694
First, I saw how worn-out
this house was,

17:41.728 --> 17:43.463
and then when I started
cleaning the mirrors,

17:43.496 --> 17:46.633
I saw the house wasn't the only
thing looking a little worn.

17:46.666 --> 17:48.968
Well, not everyone
can afford new clothes.

17:49.001 --> 17:51.438
What's the matter
with my clothes?

17:51.471 --> 17:52.939
Oh. Nothing.

17:52.972 --> 17:54.941
I was talking about my face.

17:54.974 --> 17:56.576
I tried wearing more makeup

17:56.609 --> 17:58.545
and fixing my hair,

17:58.578 --> 18:01.548
but underneath all that,
I still got these little lines

18:01.581 --> 18:03.650
and dark circles under my eyes.

18:03.683 --> 18:05.952
Virginia, you still look great.

18:05.985 --> 18:07.720
Yeah, I know.

18:07.754 --> 18:10.223
But I don't look 25.

18:10.257 --> 18:12.592
I could pass for 28, tops.

18:12.625 --> 18:15.628
But these damn glasses
make Burt look even better,

18:15.662 --> 18:18.097
and I just know that eventually
he's gonna realize

18:18.131 --> 18:21.501
I'm not the hot piece of ass
I was one or two months ago.

18:21.534 --> 18:23.236
Don't some people say
that it's what's

18:23.270 --> 18:24.837
on the inside that counts?

18:24.871 --> 18:26.473
Yeah. Ugly people.

18:26.506 --> 18:28.475
Burt and I used
to make fun of people

18:28.508 --> 18:29.776
who said things like that.

18:29.809 --> 18:31.744
Now he's gonna be
making fun of me.

18:31.778 --> 18:34.781
Pretty sure he's got
other things on his mind.

18:34.814 --> 18:36.683
I don't want to die!

18:36.716 --> 18:39.186
It's every father's dream
to outlive his son.

18:39.219 --> 18:40.853
We all lie
and say it's the opposite,

18:40.887 --> 18:42.622
but it's time
you knew the truth, Jimmy!

18:42.655 --> 18:44.357
(grunting)

18:44.391 --> 18:45.958
No!
I'm coming, Burt!

18:45.992 --> 18:48.495
No! (grunts) No!

18:48.528 --> 18:50.363
Burt!

18:50.397 --> 18:53.132
Whoa! Not the best time
to startle me.

18:53.166 --> 18:54.367
How'd you get in here?

18:54.401 --> 18:56.135
Same as you.
Through the back door.

18:56.169 --> 18:57.637
(laughs)
That's a good one.

18:57.670 --> 19:01.007
Write that down, nurse.

19:01.040 --> 19:02.609
What the hell is that?

19:02.642 --> 19:04.444
That's your husband's colon.

19:04.477 --> 19:06.313
JIMMY:
At that moment, my mom saw

19:06.346 --> 19:08.781
the most disgusting part
of my dad.

19:08.815 --> 19:10.683
(exhales)

19:12.319 --> 19:15.154
But it didn't change
how she felt about him.

19:16.723 --> 19:18.891
And even though
she almost lost her lunch,

19:18.925 --> 19:21.861
she gained some perspective on
her relationship with my dad.

19:21.894 --> 19:24.397
If she could still love him
after seeing

19:24.431 --> 19:26.466
how gross he was on the inside,

19:26.499 --> 19:28.201
then, of course,
he would love her

19:28.235 --> 19:31.170
no matter what she thought
about her outsides.

19:32.071 --> 19:34.207
(sighs)

19:37.544 --> 19:42.014
Well, that's one in a row
for you, Wild Bill.

19:42.048 --> 19:43.250
Hey.

19:43.283 --> 19:45.151
I'm alive.

19:45.184 --> 19:47.887
Yeah, and they said everything
looks great.

19:47.920 --> 19:49.722
Well, actually,
it looks disgusting,

19:49.756 --> 19:53.493
but that's how it's supposed to
look, so you're gonna be fine.

19:53.526 --> 19:54.927
Wow, that is some zit.

19:54.961 --> 19:57.697
No, it's cute.

19:57.730 --> 20:00.733
Look like you did
back in high school.

20:00.767 --> 20:02.535
I don't know
about the glasses, though.

20:02.569 --> 20:03.936
Every time I come in
to kiss you,

20:03.970 --> 20:05.938
I see my own reflection,
and let's face it,

20:05.972 --> 20:08.174
I'm not as young
as I used to be.

20:08.207 --> 20:09.609
I'll get contacts.

20:09.642 --> 20:12.111
They're having a 50% off sale
at Glasses Land.

20:12.144 --> 20:13.846
Hey, Burt.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.948
Think this
belongs to you.

20:15.982 --> 20:19.018
Hey! My buffalo nickel.

20:19.051 --> 20:20.987
Thanks, Aquaman.

20:22.289 --> 20:25.258
I think he's still
feeling the anesthesia.

20:28.428 --> 20:30.297
Hey, what are
you doing?

20:30.330 --> 20:31.931
I thought we agreed
not to put Hope

20:31.964 --> 20:33.199
in any videos that we post.

20:33.232 --> 20:34.634
Oh, no, Jimmy, I'm
not gonna post this.

20:34.667 --> 20:36.269
I-I'm done with that.

20:36.303 --> 20:39.238
It's dumb to compete over
these silly little videos.

20:39.272 --> 20:41.541
And, look, we already
inadvertently compete

20:41.574 --> 20:44.911
over Hope's affection and
whose hair looks better,

20:44.944 --> 20:47.079
who finishes first
in the bedroom.

20:47.113 --> 20:49.115
Undefeated.
(laughs)

20:49.148 --> 20:51.751
Yes, you are.

20:51.784 --> 20:53.052
Hey, you, come here.

20:53.085 --> 20:54.787
(growling)

20:59.526 --> 21:01.260
Has Jimmy posted
anything?

21:01.294 --> 21:02.228
No.

21:02.261 --> 21:03.396
What about Sabrina?

21:03.430 --> 21:04.564
No.

21:04.597 --> 21:05.798
What do we do now?

21:05.832 --> 21:08.468
I guess we could live our lives.

21:08.501 --> 21:09.702
What lives?

21:16.175 --> 21:17.744
(beep)
Oh, look.

21:17.777 --> 21:20.279
"People screaming like goats."

21:20.313 --> 21:21.348
(bleating)
