| made a mistake.

41:17.684 --> 41:21.479
I've looked after you
since you were a nursling, Arthur.

41:21.646 --> 41:25.817
You should have known I love you
far too much ever to betray you.

41:31.239 --> 41:32.782
Gaius...

41:33.783 --> 41:35.952
...who abducted you?

41:40.373 --> 41:42.417
| couldn't say...

41:43.626 --> 41:46.963
...but I'm certain they were in league
with Morgana.

41:47.672 --> 41:51.134
-What did they want?
-Information...

41:51.592 --> 41:55.722
...about you, Camelot.

41:55.888 --> 41:57.807
To help bring down the kingdom.

41:58.599 --> 42:00.018
Did they get it?

42:02.645 --> 42:05.314
Morgana got nothing from me.

[SIGHS]

42:19.537 --> 42:21.205
I'm grateful.

42:25.835 --> 42:30.048
But there's a matter that still concerns me.

42:31.257 --> 42:36.846
When you were asked about the sorcerer
who killed my father...

42:40.183 --> 42:41.642
...you lied.

42:44.395 --> 42:45.813
| did, sire.

42:45.980 --> 42:49.025
-You admit it?
-I chose to protect him.

42:49.192 --> 42:52.862
| feared you would seek him out
and execute him.

42:54.322 --> 42:56.741
That would have been a grave mistake.

42:56.908 --> 42:59.786
The sorcerer did not kill your father.

42:59.952 --> 43:02.663
Uther was dying.

43:03.122 --> 43:07.001
He tried everything in his power to save him.

43:14.717 --> 43:17.386
Contained within this great kingdom...

43:17.553 --> 43:20.056
...is a rich variety of people...

43:20.223 --> 43:23.559
...with a range of different beliefs.

43:24.352 --> 43:28.231
I'm not the only one seeking to protect you.

43:30.108 --> 43:35.822
There are many more who believe
in the world you are trying to create.

43:36.656 --> 43:39.367
One day, you will learn, Arthur.

43:40.868 --> 43:43.955
One day, you will understand...

43:45.248 --> 43:48.626
...just how much they've done for you.

NARRATOR:
Merlin.

43:58.719 --> 44:01.389
There's something at work here
that I don't understand.

44:01.556 --> 44:03.099
Are you suggesting sorcery?

44:03.266 --> 44:04.976
GAIUS: A lamia.
-Aah!

44:05.143 --> 44:07.395
A creature of magic.

44:08.855 --> 44:11.107
They could control the mind of a man.

44:11.274 --> 44:13.818
-Get away from her.
-It's something about you, Merlin.

44:14.360 --> 44:17.488
It's the way she looks at you,
as if you were the enemy.

44:17.655 --> 44:20.700
We're the ones in danger, Leon.
She's led us to a trap.
