a family.

00:04.107 --> 00:07.641
Once there was a strange pop

00:09.832 --> 00:12.286
Wherever Robert is following it death and destruction.

00:12.315 --> 00:14.449
Some call it coincidence.

00:14.478 --> 00:16.129
Others claim that Robert supernatural events

00:16.165 --> 00:17.686
Is a manufacture of disturbed spirits.

00:17.721 --> 00:20.374
Many people believe that Robert is the

01:00.042 --> 01:04.004
Agatha, take this.
I put it down here.

01:08.211 --> 01:09.692
How is she?

01:10.733 --> 01:14.056
She's... it's not really good with her.

01:14.877 --> 01:18.682
I hope you do not mind me asking,
but... What happened?

01:19.943 --> 01:22.904
There lately happened a lot of things

01:23.546 --> 01:26.568
Always at night.
Like what?

01:27.630 --> 01:30.871
... As we hear things.

01:32.155 --> 01:34.731
As if people walk through the aisles.

01:35.439 --> 01:37.445
As if moving the furniture.

01:38.562 --> 01:42.192
A few nights ago I went out and
was written on the walls.

01:44.007 --> 01:45.693
Horrible messages.

01:47.570 --> 01:50.316
As if there really was someone in the house

01:50.351 --> 01:52.139
You know as well as I do.

01:52.175 --> 01:53.601
We have to move.

01:54.177 --> 01:57.378
I know you do not want to believe at first,
but you can not deny it anymore.

01:58.260 --> 02:00.503
There is a dark presence here.

02:01.464 --> 02:04.324
I know, Debbie. I know that.

02:05.789 --> 02:07.950
There is a presence here...

02:11.744 --> 02:15.608
But you're wrong about ιιn thing.
What?

02:16.560 --> 02:19.089
It's not the house that's possessed...

02:22.585 --> 02:24.345
It's the doll.

02:46.807 --> 02:48.767
THREE YEARS LATER

02:50.393 --> 02:52.983
Thanks Mom.
You're welcome.

02:56.839 --> 02:59.334
Good morning, Mrs. Otto.
Good morning.

03:04.047 --> 03:05.410
Is everything all right?

03:05.889 --> 03:08.399
I'm looking for the dustpan.

03:09.292 --> 03:10.759
It is in the closet.

03:18.942 --> 03:20.838
Oh, of course... Oh, yeah.

03:30.393 --> 03:31.721
Ah, sorry.

03:33.716 --> 03:35.412
Good morning, champion.
Hι, Dad.

03:39.802 --> 03:40.813
Yes.

03:42.164 --> 03:47.098
Did I mention that Agatha
is a little senile?

03:47.122 --> 03:48.202
Yes.

03:48.651 --> 03:50.293
Sure, it is getting worse.

03:50.328 --> 03:51.451
Really?

03:51.694 --> 03:52.921
Yes...

03:52.956 --> 03:54.810
She begins to forget things.

03:54.977 --> 03:57.844
It starts to become a problem, to be honest.

03:57.879 --> 03:59.453
What do you do?

04:01.745 --> 04:02.963
Well...

04:03.126 --> 04:07.756
I know we have to do it, but...
God, I feel so bad, you know.

04:08.551 --> 04:10.546
I think they need help, family

04:10.570 --> 04:11.820
Or someone close to her.

04:11.875 --> 04:13.608
Jenn do not feel bad, it is our

04:13.632 --> 04:15.725
Worker, if she can not do her job,

04:15.749 --> 04:17.483
We have no choice andwere.

04:17.521 --> 04:20.584
She's only been here two years and not 20.

04:23.166 --> 04:27.003
Will you tell her?
No I can not.

04:27.038 --> 04:28.507
I have an important meeting, Jenn.

04:28.571 --> 04:31.052

Just like me.

06:32.737 --> 06:35.306
Jenn, you do not have to feel bad about that, okι?

06:35.459 --> 06:36.377
I know...

06:36.860 --> 06:38.169
It's just...

06:39.263 --> 06:42.393
Every confrontation makes me anxious.

06:42.466 --> 06:44.001
And you know it.

06:44.508 --> 06:46.546
Do you think I should fire her?

06:52.836 --> 06:55.203
You know my symptoms
are caused by stress?

06:56.399 --> 07:00.300
Yes, I feel I've done a damn
stressful thing.

07:01.884 --> 07:04.088
Sorry, Jenn. You knew I today

07:04.112 --> 07:05.579
Had to go to the Court, right?

07:05.848 --> 07:07.671

07:09.652 --> 07:12.741
Alsjerblieft Do not be mad at me
, not tonight, okι?

07:13.615 --> 07:15.646
No, I'm not angry, it's just...

07:17.300 --> 07:19.438
I just want you exert a little

07:19.462 --> 07:21.664
To understand my illness.

07:22.425 --> 07:23.908
That's all.

07:24.306 --> 07:25.806
As I understand it, Jenn.

07:26.830 --> 07:27.893
Seriously.

07:31.554 --> 07:32.669
Look...

07:33.496 --> 07:35.582
I'm going upstairs to see how it is with Gene

07:35.617 --> 07:37.656
Then I come back downstairs and...

07:38.641 --> 07:41.530
I'm going to cook something fresh, something delicious.

07:43.807 --> 07:45.674
Do you cook for me?
Yes.

07:46.089 --> 07:47.364
If you want to.

07:51.254 --> 07:54.204
Okι, it would be nice, thank you.

08:34.857 --> 08:35.869
How are you?

08:39.023 --> 08:40.057
Parties.

08:43.145 --> 08:44.683
You continue to amaze me.

08:46.409 --> 08:50.438
Come on, Jenn, this is the least I can do,
after everything you did for me.

09:04.057 --> 09:04.983
Is something wrong?

09:09.131 --> 09:10.242
I can not help it...

09:12.936 --> 09:17.084
Sometimes I think you see me as... a mother.

09:18.320 --> 09:19.648
A housewife.

09:22.345 --> 09:23.937
I'm more than that.

09:28.995 --> 09:30.878
Remember when
Gene was born, we promised that we

09:30.902 --> 09:32.980
Would trust our carriθre.

09:34.477 --> 09:37.959
Jenn... my work is our
main source of income.

09:48.370 --> 09:50.093
Maybe I can get some more free

09:50.194 --> 09:52.281
My werr so I have more time for him.

09:55.078 --> 09:57.375
You know, I've got my hands full with Gene.

09:59.142 --> 10:01.216
We must share our responsibility

10:01.240 --> 10:02.880
But we have little time the last days, hι?

10:03.246 --> 10:04.609
Good.

10:05.070 --> 10:07.782
I will do my best to be here, okι?

10:10.393 --> 10:11.418
Double.

10:25.288 --> 10:29.154
Look, I hate this.
Come on, Jenn, too bad it's not.

10:30.253 --> 10:32.287
Maybe it needs a little more salt.

10:33.617 --> 10:35.174
Do not eat it!

10:36.219 --> 10:37.532
This!

10:39.040 --> 10:40.428
This makes me...

10:41.304 --> 10:42.965
So angry!

10:43.426 --> 10:44.751
It's good.

10:46.175 --> 10:47.194
It's good.

10:49.992 --> 10:52.799
Look... I know that life with...

10:54.758 --> 10:59.339
With someone like me... it's not exactly a picnic.

11:02.165 --> 11:04.968
But as long as you take your medications
everything is fine right?

11:06.849 --> 11:08.881
Does my illness scare you, Paul?

11:10.933 --> 11:12.355
Jenn, do not be silly.

11:14.698 --> 11:18.212
Because you so much and so late from work,
you keep getting more from me.

11:20.263 --> 11:22.361
Jenn. Jenn, look at me.

11:22.505 --> 11:23.897
Look at me.

11:24.507 --> 11:26.624
You and Gene mean the world to me.

11:28.851 --> 11:31.278
What should I do to prove it, huh?

11:37.479 --> 11:39.383
The only thing I need is your support, Paul.

11:41.604 --> 11:43.065
You did.

11:49.414 --> 11:51.347
It's fine, it's just...

11:51.875 --> 11:55.040
I did not know it would come back so quickly,
after a month already, you know?

11:57.522 --> 11:58.410
Okι.

12:03.306 --> 12:05.231
Uh... I'll call you back.

12:06.310 --> 12:08.043
Yes, okι day.

12:11.354 --> 12:14.357

12:15.318 --> 12:19.140
Do you need help with your bags?
No, I'll be fine.

12:20.643 --> 12:24.506
Is it okay if I just say goodbye
Eugene before I go?

12:25.528 --> 12:29.075
He is a big part of my
life has become the last couple of years.

12:34.498 --> 12:35.959
Of course.

12:37.781 --> 12:38.935
He's in his room.

12:58.858 --> 12:59.675
Yes?

12:59.963 --> 13:04.023
Hello, Eugene, I'll just say goodbye.

13:05.128 --> 13:06.278
Why did you leave?

13:06.769 --> 13:11.436
I do not want. But your mother says
I should go.

13:11.614 --> 13:12.829
Why?

13:13.656 --> 13:15.291
I do not know.

13:19.221 --> 13:22.421
I want to give a gift before I leave.

13:23.826 --> 13:25.168
What is it?

13:28.711 --> 13:32.593
Now I'm no longer needed here,
do you need a new friend.

13:38.842 --> 13:40.744
This is Robert.

13:42.145 --> 13:44.643
I want you to give him a home.

13:45.248 --> 13:47.972
But... dolls are for girls.

13:48.211 --> 13:49.498
Not this doll...

13:49.533 --> 13:51.120
This doll is different.

13:51.775 --> 13:54.386
How?
Robert is special.

13:54.498 --> 13:57.315
He will protect you from
evil.

13:57.350 --> 14:00.133
It will be your best friend forever.

14:01.196 --> 14:02.926
It looks strange.

14:03.626 --> 14:05.093
You should not say.

14:05.528 --> 14:07.239
Never be rude to Robert.

14:07.723 --> 14:09.201

15:51.214 --> 15:52.879
Oh, that's Robert.

16:07.811 --> 16:10.937
Where did you get this?
Agatha gave it to me.

16:12.303 --> 16:13.467
Why?

16:14.478 --> 16:17.051
She wanted me to make a new friend
now she was gone.

16:17.961 --> 16:19.343
Mom...

16:19.367 --> 16:21.148
Why had to leave Agatha?

16:29.213 --> 16:30.410
Well...

16:31.455 --> 16:33.876
She... was...

16:35.499 --> 16:39.572
A bit forgetful be on it, and...

16:40.703 --> 16:42.896
Because I had no job for her.

16:43.826 --> 16:49.099
I have to do with her.
I know, me too.

16:52.234 --> 16:53.729
You were so mean to her.

16:56.158 --> 16:57.733
Do not say that, Gene.

16:58.761 --> 17:00.297
That's what Robert said.

17:02.205 --> 17:05.135
It was not my intention to onstslaan Agatha okι?

17:05.159 --> 17:06.734

18:21.004 --> 18:24.010
I just wanted a mustache on the Mona Lisa

Yes.

18:33.815 --> 18:36.171
Oh, God, it was so uncomfortable.

18:36.238 --> 18:38.067
Do not worry. It had to happen.

18:39.473 --> 18:40.268
I know.

18:41.903 --> 18:43.902
Gene has a new boyfriend.

How did you get that little guy?

19:27.469 --> 19:29.292
Agatha gave it to me.

19:31.874 --> 19:35.452
Since when do you play with dolls, Gene?

19:36.239 --> 19:39.348
I normally do not.
But he's different.

19:39.372 --> 19:41.070

Well I'm going to go down to biginnen
with dinner.

19:56.161 --> 19:57.676
I, uh...

19:58.262 --> 20:00.446
I leave you with your new friend alone.

20:02.025 --> 20:03.266
Okι.

20:04.202 --> 20:05.041
Okι.

20:23.485 --> 20:25.092
So, uh...

20:25.809 --> 20:31.682
His friend is a doll, hι?
Yes, he is ugly.

20:31.717 --> 20:33.261
Oh, my God.

20:33.296 --> 20:36.556
Agatha gave it to him.
Really strange gift, hι?

20:36.591 --> 20:37.791
It's a boy, Jenn.

20:37.815 --> 20:40.435
Boys do not play with dolls,
especially at his age.

20:42.744 --> 20:44.014
What?

20:45.107 --> 20:48.652
What are you perhaps do a
asshole full of testosterone.

20:48.676 --> 20:49.853
I'm Jenn.

20:49.873 --> 20:52.962
Oh yeah, you just flip
because he has a doll.

20:53.316 --> 20:55.661
You're afraid that our son is a sissy.

20:55.958 --> 20:57.482
I have never said that, right?

20:59.001 --> 21:01.130
Yes, but your face says something quite different.

21:04.607 --> 21:06.527
It's just a little weird
, that's all.

21:10.172 --> 21:13.420
Anyway, do not worry
yet he is growing up.

21:17.340 --> 21:19.559
He says that pop talk to him.

21:21.184 --> 21:23.213
Yes, children always talk to
their toys.

21:26.229 --> 21:27.434
Sure.

21:31.434 --> 21:33.679
What's the matter with you?
Nothing.

21:38.121 --> 21:39.622
Ah, okι, I understand.

21:41.043 --> 21:42.048
What?

21:43.086 --> 21:48.091
You fear that he hears voices,
like me for my medication.

21:49.292 --> 21:53.047
Do not be silly, not everything has to do
with your illness, you know?

21:53.416 --> 21:55.513
Okι,
Why are you so defensive?

21:56.346 --> 21:59.383
I do not pretend to think of the
all the time, okι?

21:59.622 --> 22:01.814
Okay, fine!

22:09.669 --> 22:11.449
Look, I'm sorry if I afsnauw.

22:11.685 --> 22:13.169
But it's been a difficult day, okι?

22:14.038 --> 22:16.798
It's not always easy
defend my clients.

22:18.162 --> 22:19.539
It's good.

22:20.244 --> 22:21.557
You want me to cook tonight?

22:22.326 --> 22:23.751
No, I do.

22:25.729 --> 22:28.268
Are you sure?
Yes.

25:31.794 --> 25:33.269
Shit!

25:57.000 --> 25:58.372
Gene?

26:01.485 --> 26:02.938
ΏGene, is that you?

26:59.613 --> 27:00.873
Gene?

27:02.845 --> 27:04.577
Have you been down here last night?

27:05.148 --> 27:06.309
Where?

27:07.009 --> 27:08.258
Here.

27:08.331 --> 27:09.809
In the kitchen.

27:10.173 --> 27:11.498
Last night.

27:12.655 --> 27:14.720
If you come down and have you
the sugar thrown on the ground?

27:15.057 --> 27:16.280
No.

27:16.618 --> 27:19.061
Are you sure?
Yes.

27:20.182 --> 27:22.992
Are you telling me the truth?
Yes.

27:26.269 --> 27:26.920
Maybe I have it

27:27.022 --> 27:28.787
Ask your father if he did it.

27:29.192 --> 27:30.762
It was not Dad.

27:34.437 --> 27:35.867
Who was it?

27:38.241 --> 27:39.560
It was Robert.

27:40.253 --> 27:43.823
When Robert was here below, it was
you here below.

27:44.247 --> 27:45.414
That was not me.

27:45.588 --> 27:48.189
Robert does not want me to go with him
when he goes to investigate.

27:50.694 --> 27:51.599
Look... okι...

27:52.175 --> 27:56.782
Listen, if you do something
or knocks in the future

27:56.980 --> 27:59.400
I want you to tell me, understand?

27:59.435 --> 28:01.067
If you have it cleaned up.

28:02.385 --> 28:03.659
Prima.

28:05.508 --> 28:07.531
Gene  Good morning, good morning Jenn.

28:07.755 --> 28:09.898
Do you want to make some juice for me?

28:13.476 --> 28:14.331
Okι, buddy...

28:14.537 --> 28:16.770
It's a beautiful day, so I thought

28:16.794 --> 28:18.130
We can go out with the bike.
What do you say?

28:18.165 --> 28:19.255
Okι. Robert also can be taken?

28:19.279 --> 28:21.585
Of course, Robert is also invited.

28:24.447 --> 28:26.537
Claro, Robert puede venir tambiιn.

28:27.330 --> 28:28.228
Cool.

28:52.259 --> 28:56.344
Hι... you'll... you come to bed?

28:56.379 --> 29:00.346
No, I want to finish my painting.

29:02.004 --> 29:03.393
Okι.

30:09.273 --> 30:10.411
Shit!

31:27.630 --> 31:28.870
Gene!

31:30.212 --> 31:31.398
What?

31:31.454 --> 31:34.146
What's this?
What ?!

31:34.957 --> 31:37.245
Why have you ruined my painting?

31:37.480 --> 31:38.837
I have not done.

31:39.562 --> 31:42.286
Do not lie to me!
I do not lie.

31:42.310 --> 31:44.284
I saw the footprints, Gene!

31:44.967 --> 31:47.853
They are not mine.
Oh, who will?

31:48.532 --> 31:52.276
Robert!
Do not be ridiculous!

31:52.296 --> 31:53.132
But mom...

31:53.137 --> 31:55.716
It's enough, what you did was very common.

31:55.859 --> 31:58.440
I want you to never come in my
study. Never again!

31:58.475 --> 31:59.694
Do you understand me?
Hι!

31:59.718 --> 32:00.885
Hι!

32:01.344 --> 32:02.619
What is going on?

32:03.326 --> 32:05.200
My painting down there.

32:05.390 --> 32:08.683
Gene is there anywhere paint thrown over it.

32:09.392 --> 32:12.099
Gene, why did you do that?
I have not done.

32:12.435 --> 32:14.473
Stop lying!

32:15.839 --> 32:18.474
Okι, calm, okι? it is late.

32:19.562 --> 32:23.118
Just go to bed, we act
it off this morning.

32:27.629 --> 32:29.048
Prima.

32:36.458 --> 32:39.276
Gene, you've really screwed up your mother's painting?

32:45.749 --> 32:47.968
Go to sleep, okι?

33:24.546 --> 33:25.916
What happened?

33:26.308 --> 33:29.735
I left the studio for a few minutes,

33:29.759 --> 33:32.040
And when I came back there was
paint on my canvas.

33:32.795 --> 33:36.365
For weeks work is fucked!

33:36.760 --> 33:39.048
Do you really think the Gene
really did?

33:39.843 --> 33:41.439
Who should have done it differently?

33:42.405 --> 33:44.790
Maybe it was an accident, Jenn.

33:44.928 --> 33:46.718
That was no accident.

33:47.350 --> 33:51.696
Okι, look... you should not overdo it
, okι?

33:53.936 --> 33:55.281
Paul...

33:56.339 --> 33:59.658
You please stop to
treat me if I'm made of glass?

34:01.424 --> 34:03.323
You look if I break any moment.

34:14.241 --> 34:15.235
Okι.

34:19.734 --> 34:21.489
Yes. True?

34:22.753 --> 34:23.648
You are here.

34:25.351 --> 34:26.445
That was not me, you know.

34:27.440 --> 34:28.469
Yes.

34:30.090 --> 34:31.156
I did not.

34:33.132 --> 34:33.900
Prima.

34:35.859 --> 34:37.148
What do you mean.

34:51.274 --> 34:52.831
It's late.

34:54.637 --> 34:56.295
Why are you awake?

34:57.400 --> 34:58.935
I can not sleep.

35:02.604 --> 35:04.855
I heard two voices.

35:06.929 --> 35:08.749
Who are you talking to?

35:09.852 --> 35:12.805
Robert.
And Robert talk back?

35:14.336 --> 35:15.461
Yes.

35:16.098 --> 35:18.191
Talk to him every Horticultural,
or just to you?

35:18.942 --> 35:20.103
Allen against me.

35:24.467 --> 35:25.689
Look...

35:29.192 --> 35:31.317
I'm sorry I went on like that against you.

35:33.276 --> 35:35.501
I did not mean to...

35:38.120 --> 35:42.265
I have worked very hard on
that painting and I...

35:43.647 --> 35:46.600
I do not understand why you've destroyed
But Mom.

35:46.650 --> 35:48.159
No, please...

35:49.813 --> 35:51.441
I want it not happened, okι.

35:51.496 --> 35:52.985

35:55.462 --> 35:59.503
I hope you understand, how disappointed I am

35:59.603 --> 36:02.303
And why I was so angry.

36:03.586 --> 36:04.829
Okι?

36:06.139 --> 36:07.477
It's...

36:11.580 --> 36:12.646
Let's forget this.

36:13.716 --> 36:14.845
Okι.

36:18.601 --> 36:22.960
Now go to sleep, you need

36:44.200 --> 36:45.154
Godemorgen.

36:46.388 --> 36:48.179
Hi, I'm Martha.

36:49.551 --> 36:50.932

36:50.956 --> 36:53.408

36:54.256 --> 36:56.997
Oh yeah, come in, please.

Thank you for this opportunity.

37:06.328 --> 37:06.922
Oh yeah... you're welcome

37:33.356 --> 37:35.418
Hello.

37:36.159 --> 37:37.046

37:37.047 --> 37:39.652
Well, I'm going upstairs to

37:40.403 --> 37:41.167
Great.

37:47.970 --> 37:50.603

37:54.136 --> 37:56.154
For an hour or something.

37:57.430 --> 37:58.305
Okι.

38:21.122 --> 38:23.658
What is that thing?

38:27.209 --> 38:29.235
What an ugly!

40:39.622 --> 40:41.432
Shit! Jesus!

40:42.585 --> 40:45.203
Oh, Jesus Christ! Martha...

Oh my God. Okι, uh... do not move.

40:57.694 --> 40:58.837
Yes.

41:02.205 --> 41:03.272

41:06.809 --> 41:07.855
I do not know, uh...

41:09.852 --> 41:11.052
Okι wa...

41:12.895 --> 41:14.343
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

41:16.298 --> 41:18.283
Say that again sweetheart,
say it again.

41:21.423 --> 41:22.413
What?

41:25.149 --> 41:26.786
It was him. It was the doll.

41:40.043 --> 41:42.493
I just talked with Gene
and he seems fine to orphans.

41:44.167 --> 41:45.258
Yes...

41:48.210 --> 41:49.487
Are you all right, Jenn?

41:55.979 --> 41:57.762
Yes, I'm just a little shocked.

42:00.173 --> 42:02.044
There was so much blood, Paul.

42:04.025 --> 42:07.967
Martha is in the hospital
and everything comes back to normal with her.

42:11.152 --> 42:14.186
She said something very strange when I had found her.

42:14.210 --> 42:15.419
What did she say?

42:17.319 --> 42:19.856
She said it was the doll.

42:24.167 --> 42:25.423
The doll?

42:27.450 --> 42:28.953
That's what she said.

42:29.772 --> 42:31.411
It was the doll.

42:36.018 --> 42:39.240
What exactly does that mean?
I do not know.

42:40.542 --> 42:44.193
Maybe they struikeklde the pop Gene

42:44.228 --> 42:47.172
... But I did not realize it was on the stairs.

42:49.952 --> 42:52.080
I have an idea.

42:52.995 --> 42:54.125
What?

42:54.497 --> 42:55.778
Let's go out tonight.

42:57.099 --> 43:00.320
Oh no, no, I do not feel good now. No.

43:00.344 --> 43:03.262
Come on Jenn, I accept no
no for an answer.

43:03.365 --> 43:07.451
Okι, we go out... we go good food...

43:07.641 --> 43:10.200
We have a nice de-stress.

43:10.224 --> 43:13.754
He'll be fine.
And what about Gene?

43:14.838 --> 43:17.290
I'll call Marcie, they'll want to be careful.

43:18.021 --> 43:20.717
The last time she was here
the house was a mess.

43:20.741 --> 43:22.939
Jenn, stop which exuses,

43:22.974 --> 43:25.138
She is a sweet girl and her cute Gene vinst.

43:27.093 --> 43:28.199
Good?

43:31.474 --> 43:32.817
No, I do not know...

43:33.676 --> 43:34.974
Come on, Jenn.

43:35.838 --> 43:37.807
You've had a shock.

43:38.081 --> 43:40.084
You need to relax.

43:40.744 --> 43:41.849
Good?

43:41.886 --> 43:44.124
Besides, it's been a long time since

43:44.207 --> 43:46.140
We had time for ourselves.

43:47.410 --> 43:48.818
Okι.

43:49.921 --> 43:50.805
Okι.

43:58.460 --> 43:59.812
Hi Marcie.
Hey.

44:00.182 --> 44:02.435
Hello, come in. Thanks

44:02.470 --> 44:03.801
It's good.

44:48.350 --> 44:50.836
Are, Jenn? are you looking for something?

44:52.013 --> 44:53.307
Yes.

44:54.957 --> 44:56.589
My lipstick.

44:56.624 --> 44:59.869
As if the earth is gone.

45:00.363 --> 45:03.037
Marcie is down, you ready to go?

45:04.968 --> 45:09.285
Yes, you can... give me five minutes?

45:09.509 --> 45:10.840
Yes, sure.

45:10.875 --> 45:12.171
Thank you.

45:26.296 --> 45:27.891
God!

45:40.343 --> 45:43.863
DIE

47:53.777 --> 47:57.702
Hi Mom. What is going on?

47:59.822 --> 48:01.827
Have you played with my lipstick?

48:02.585 --> 48:04.820
Of course not! I'm not a girl.

48:06.348 --> 48:09.059
Have you written anything on the mirror
in my bedroom?

48:09.094 --> 48:12.062
No! I was down at Marcie!

48:15.601 --> 48:17.946
Are you sure you did not
messed with my lipstick?

48:18.199 --> 48:20.302
I have not done, really!

48:24.446 --> 48:26.692
What do you say to Robert
to put in the attic.

48:28.251 --> 48:30.263
I would not do it if I were you.

48:31.774 --> 48:32.756
Why not?

48:33.456 --> 48:34.999
Robert  Because you can not.

48:35.938 --> 48:39.219
He will be angry, very angry.

48:40.499 --> 48:41.511
You...

48:42.905 --> 48:44.719
You want to keep it in your room?

48:45.828 --> 48:46.964
Yes.

48:47.109 --> 48:48.617
It is not always common.

48:49.391 --> 48:51.426
Most of the time
he makes me laugh.

48:55.478 --> 48:56.614
Good.

49:01.443 --> 49:03.266
But if you want me to get rid of him hit...

49:05.487 --> 49:06.653
I want.

49:07.970 --> 49:09.345
That's good.

49:10.212 --> 49:12.648
I'm going down to Marcie.

49:35.918 --> 49:37.242
Hι, you look beautiful.

49:38.561 --> 49:39.774
Are you ready to go?

49:40.923 --> 49:42.735
I have to show you something.

49:44.688 --> 49:45.956
The bedroom.

49:46.713 --> 49:47.634
Oh, you want...

49:48.371 --> 49:49.914
I thought we were going to do later.

49:51.077 --> 49:52.160
What?

49:54.561 --> 49:57.383
No, Paul, I'm serious.
Okι?

50:09.752 --> 50:10.812
Look...

50:13.437 --> 50:14.971
What is it, Jenn?

50:16.170 --> 50:17.575
What the hell ?!

50:31.057 --> 50:32.434
Something...

50:32.494 --> 50:34.827
There was something written on the mirror.

50:38.221 --> 50:41.535
Remember when I was looking for the lipstick?
Yes.

50:42.985 --> 50:49.984
I came in... there was death...
death was written with my lipstick

50:50.019 --> 50:53.362
And then went to the room of Gene

50:53.955 --> 50:56.151
And Robert had my lipstick in his hand.

50:56.819 --> 50:58.950
Jenn...

50:59.201 --> 51:00.614
Jenn, Jenn, look at me.

51:00.804 --> 51:01.752
Jenn?

51:02.124 --> 51:03.680
No, no, look at me.

51:03.770 --> 51:04.979
Look at me.

51:08.011 --> 51:11.955
There is nothing in the mirror now.
But... I saw it... it was...

51:12.315 --> 51:13.235
Jenn!

51:14.417 --> 51:15.459
Jenn!

51:20.182 --> 51:22.186
Marcie is downstairs with Gene.

51:25.187 --> 51:26.268
Yes...

51:27.831 --> 51:31.306
And we're going out tonight.

51:31.975 --> 51:34.755
You had an impressive
and stressful day.

51:36.319 --> 51:37.779
Look at me, Jenn.

51:40.363 --> 51:42.341
We would go together, right?

51:44.687 --> 51:45.805
Okι?

51:46.849 --> 51:50.949
We go out like we used to,
just you and me.

51:52.454 --> 51:54.893
We're going to have a nice evening,
I promise.

51:55.183 --> 51:57.149
Come here.

51:58.641 --> 52:00.293
Come on.

52:05.267 --> 52:06.760
It's alright, it's alright.

52:28.610 --> 52:30.400
Can you leave the lights on?

52:32.694 --> 52:34.187
Goodnight, Gene.

53:02.785 --> 53:03.779
Okι, come on.

53:04.569 --> 53:06.220
What are you thinking?

53:06.689 --> 53:07.710
What?

53:09.291 --> 53:11.257
You're doing all night like that.

53:11.292 --> 53:12.460
What is it?

53:15.298 --> 53:20.351
Paul, something strange about the house
wrong, do not you see it?

53:21.363 --> 53:22.780
What do you mean?

53:22.785 --> 53:27.148
Well, I found the vacuum cleaner in a pool of blood
bottom of the stairs.

53:27.950 --> 53:29.667
Curiously, do not you think?

53:29.732 --> 53:31.330
It was an accident.

53:32.395 --> 53:34.707
And then there was written on the mirror.

53:35.699 --> 53:37.390
Here we have already talked about?

53:38.321 --> 53:40.242
Yes, there are other things.

53:41.165 --> 53:42.374
Like what?

53:43.927 --> 53:46.370
Last night went into the room of Gene.

53:48.090 --> 53:50.946
I heard two voices coming from his room

53:51.373 --> 53:54.552
And when I went inside
he talking to that doll.

53:57.819 --> 53:59.405
You heard... you heard voices?

54:00.102 --> 54:02.382
Look, I know what you're thinking

54:02.417 --> 54:05.350
But this was not my symptoms, okι?
It was real.

54:05.427 --> 54:09.476
Maybe it seemed real.
I'm serious, Paul.

54:11.193 --> 54:13.075
Since Agatha doll on

54:13.095 --> 54:15.345
Gene has made strange things happen.

54:15.380 --> 54:16.581
As...

54:19.120 --> 54:20.163
Gene...

54:23.645 --> 54:25.758
Gene told me that pop talk back.

54:28.050 --> 54:29.845
You have a stressful time

54:29.880 --> 54:32.012
And had a stressful day, Jenn.

54:32.855 --> 54:34.611
Sometimes when you are stressed

54:34.714 --> 54:37.426
The smallest things can disturb you.

54:44.527 --> 54:46.932
Do you think that these things only
in my head?

54:48.173 --> 54:49.999
You say you hear things

54:50.023 --> 54:52.724
And see things. I do not know what to believe.

54:52.748 --> 54:54.279
You believe me not?

54:54.314 --> 54:55.811
What does that mean?

54:55.838 --> 54:57.527
Maybe you're forgetting that I
through the years

54:57.551 --> 54:59.090
Had a diagnosis. But not me!

54:59.114 --> 55:02.239
My God, I do know otherwise.

55:03.646 --> 55:07.784
I feel betrayed, Paul.
Do not be ridiculous, Jenny!

55:08.210 --> 55:10.238
I have never cheated or something?

55:10.532 --> 55:13.995
Why do men always it

55:14.019 --> 55:16.462
The only way is to cheat
to gain the trust of a woman?

55:18.500 --> 55:20.573
You do not support me, Paul!

55:20.597 --> 55:22.807
Okι, Jenn! Please! It's all good!

55:54.601 --> 55:55.687
Marcie?

55:57.893 --> 55:59.069
Marcie!

56:01.883 --> 56:04.259
She's not down here. Marcie!

56:04.483 --> 56:06.602
Gene ?!

56:12.314 --> 56:13.632
Ah, thank God!

56:18.640 --> 56:22.319
It's okay, honey. Go back to sleep.

56:41.122 --> 56:42.911
What is wrong with this girl?

56:43.585 --> 56:46.382
She goes away and leave our son alone!

56:46.429 --> 56:48.493
Jesus, what kind of game she plays.

56:49.752 --> 56:52.132
You know what? This is ridiculous.

56:52.675 --> 56:53.814
I'm calling to her house.

56:53.915 --> 56:56.092
Calm, Jenn. Okι?

56:56.413 --> 56:57.615
I'm calling to her house.

56:58.380 --> 57:02.436
Do not tell me that I need to calm down,
you let the damn door!

57:02.764 --> 57:04.738
Anyone can enter!

57:58.946 --> 58:00.298
Okι, thanks.

58:02.024 --> 58:03.099
Thanks.

58:03.685 --> 58:04.760
Day.

58:08.711 --> 58:09.887
What is going on?

58:11.954 --> 58:13.008
She's dead.

58:14.637 --> 58:15.561
Who?

58:15.758 --> 58:17.035
Marcie.

58:20.162 --> 58:23.162
What?
The police replied.

58:24.726 --> 58:26.715
They want to have a conversation with us or something.

58:28.129 --> 58:32.188
A conversation with us? what happened?

58:48.190 --> 58:50.626
Oh, God. It was only a child!

58:50.816 --> 58:52.560
Swe was just a child!

58:55.678 --> 58:58.574
What the hell's going on, Paul ?!

59:00.547 --> 59:03.560
I can not handle this.
Look...

59:04.822 --> 59:05.966
I was so...

59:06.368 --> 59:09.735
Sometimes things happen
all at once, Jenn.

59:10.813 --> 59:12.777
It's just how life is.

59:15.217 --> 59:17.449
Do not fucking be ridiculous!

59:19.221 --> 59:22.528
There is seriously something seriously wrong,
why you do not see that.

59:22.563 --> 59:24.354
Why can not you see, Paul?

59:24.627 --> 59:27.685
Jenn... just go to bed, okι?

59:28.591 --> 59:33.019
It was a strange day.
I am also so to bed, okay?

59:36.053 --> 59:36.922
Go.

59:36.957 --> 59:38.995
You, filthy fucking... go!

01:00:11.714 --> 01:00:16.863
Gene... to wake dear,
I need to talk to you.

01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:18.889
Mom?

01:00:23.605 --> 01:00:25.524
I have to ask you something.

01:00:26.188 --> 01:00:30.205
And... I want you to tell me the truth.

01:00:31.593 --> 01:00:32.702
Good?

01:00:32.994 --> 01:00:34.270
Good!

01:00:36.138 --> 01:00:41.036
You told me that Robert is talking to you.

01:00:41.060 --> 01:00:42.149
Yes.

01:00:43.426 --> 01:00:44.864
What is he saying?

01:00:44.888 --> 01:00:48.586
He said that we are best friends
, forever and ever.

01:00:48.911 --> 01:00:50.736
Did he ever say anything...

01:00:53.075 --> 01:00:54.351
Evil has?

01:00:57.119 --> 01:00:58.392
Sometimes.

01:01:00.502 --> 01:01:01.869
What is he saying?

01:01:03.065 --> 01:01:07.145
I do not want to tell you.
Gene... look...

01:01:09.052 --> 01:01:10.398
It's good.

01:01:12.094 --> 01:01:13.561
What it is...

01:01:14.897 --> 01:01:17.555
I promise you that I will not be angry.

01:01:18.981 --> 01:01:20.038
Good?

01:01:20.073 --> 01:01:22.382
He says he should not you and Dad.

01:01:29.152 --> 01:01:32.121
Why should not he to us?
Because jhij it should not.

01:01:34.318 --> 01:01:36.019
Who says we do not like him?

01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:38.619
That says Robert.

01:01:39.281 --> 01:01:40.524
So he should not Julie.

01:01:40.803 --> 01:01:41.870
Gene...

01:01:43.926 --> 01:01:47.005
Robert hurt anyone?

01:01:49.463 --> 01:01:50.656
He...

01:01:52.974 --> 01:01:54.843
Martha has pushed down the stairs.

01:01:55.577 --> 01:01:57.151
Did he tell you that he did that?

01:02:00.863 --> 01:02:01.919
Yes.

01:02:02.584 --> 01:02:05.472
Did he tell you what happened to Marcie?

01:02:07.549 --> 01:02:09.146
She made him angry.

01:02:10.747 --> 01:02:11.810
He wanted from her.

01:02:14.035 --> 01:02:18.218
Live Robert?

01:02:19.681 --> 01:02:20.840

Gene, has told me.

01:03:13.450 --> 01:03:15.055
Jenn, it's a doll.

01:03:17.034 --> 01:03:20.491
It's not a normal doll, Paul!

01:03:23.207 --> 01:03:25.999
Agatha  Since this doll
has given Gene

01:03:26.249 --> 01:03:28.578
Happen here strange things.

01:03:28.768 --> 01:03:31.545
Agatha must have known that there
something strange with this doll.

01:03:31.603 --> 01:03:34.390
That's why they gave it.

01:03:34.844 --> 01:03:36.835
It is her revenge for the dismissal.

01:03:36.870 --> 01:03:40.451
I mean when they've left
I said I was sorry

01:03:41.022 --> 01:03:43.531
And then she said... you certainly will.

01:03:46.088 --> 01:03:49.373

01:11:10.372 --> 01:11:11.677
Do you have a moment, anyway?

01:11:14.898 --> 01:11:17.341
It's about my wife, Jenny.

01:11:17.376 --> 01:11:18.543
And, uh...

01:11:22.505 --> 01:11:23.922
And my son, Gene.

01:14:05.446 --> 01:14:06.407
Hello.

01:14:07.109 --> 01:14:09.288
Hello... Can I help you?

01:14:10.111 --> 01:14:11.753
Steven, right?
Yes.

01:14:11.843 --> 01:14:13.064
Yes.

01:14:14.195 --> 01:14:18.583
I am Jennifer Otto and
I want to talk to you about Agatha.

01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:23.138
She has worked here, right?

01:14:24.126 --> 01:14:25.121
Yes, she has.

01:14:28.850 --> 01:14:31.945
I'm afraid she's recently deceased.

01:14:34.537 --> 01:14:37.348
Do not like to hear it,
which is really bad news.

01:14:37.740 --> 01:14:39.328
Yes, uh...

01:14:43.186 --> 01:14:44.248
Anyway, uh...

01:14:45.388 --> 01:14:47.150
I want to know if we can talk.

01:14:47.810 --> 01:14:50.857
This is I do not look so good.
I'm sorry.

01:14:53.936 --> 01:14:57.397
To be honest... I come from far away, and...

01:14:57.800 --> 01:15:00.198
I will not take up too much time.

01:15:00.388 --> 01:15:01.387
But...

01:15:02.124 --> 01:15:03.308
5 minutes.

01:15:04.646 --> 01:15:05.549
Well...

01:15:06.568 --> 01:15:07.516
Yes, that's...

01:15:08.049 --> 01:15:09.259
5 minutes.

01:15:10.893 --> 01:15:11.507
Thank you.

01:15:11.542 --> 01:15:13.006
Come in.
Thank you.

01:15:26.468 --> 01:15:27.486
Hι, Gene...

01:15:29.871 --> 01:15:33.624
Do you Robert caught the scvhuur?
No.

01:15:34.436 --> 01:15:36.047
Why was he in the barn?

01:15:38.247 --> 01:15:39.626
Are you...

01:15:41.203 --> 01:15:42.705
Your mother put him in there.

01:15:44.646 --> 01:15:45.740
Oh, no!

01:15:46.809 --> 01:15:47.838
What?

01:15:50.292 --> 01:15:51.913
Robert is going to be angry.

01:15:54.335 --> 01:15:56.599
So you want to talk to me about Agatha?

01:16:01.142 --> 01:16:02.331
Yes.

01:16:02.364 --> 01:16:03.522
Something.

01:16:04.466 --> 01:16:05.515
Okι?

01:16:05.988 --> 01:16:07.125
What does that mean?

01:16:07.834 --> 01:16:08.814
Well, uh...

01:16:11.306 --> 01:16:13.993
Agatha has worked for several years
for my family.

01:16:16.759 --> 01:16:18.452
But she was a bit of...

01:16:20.683 --> 01:16:23.126
Senile and forgetful.

01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:27.706
Yes... I actually, uh... her hearing

01:16:27.730 --> 01:16:30.664
Already slightly deteriorated when
she still worked for us.

01:16:30.893 --> 01:16:32.043
Yes, I mean...

01:16:33.055 --> 01:16:34.985
Maybe you already know, but...

01:16:36.299 --> 01:16:37.735
We had to let her go.

01:16:40.703 --> 01:16:41.765
Anyway...

01:16:43.826 --> 01:16:47.163
Before she left she gave
my son a doll.

01:16:49.031 --> 01:16:50.717
The doll name is Robert.

01:16:53.355 --> 01:16:55.208
Quiet, please.

01:16:56.179 --> 01:16:57.177
What?

01:16:58.921 --> 01:17:00.172
My wife...

01:17:00.343 --> 01:17:02.162
My wife is upstairs.

01:17:04.927 --> 01:17:08.186
My wife is upstairs and is not quite right.

01:17:12.014 --> 01:17:13.232
I'm sorry to hear that.

01:17:14.056 --> 01:17:15.904
I know of pop.

01:17:20.743 --> 01:17:22.163
Why are we whispering?

01:17:23.545 --> 01:17:26.821
Because the doll is why
my wife is not well.

01:17:29.271 --> 01:17:30.475
What do you mean?

01:17:31.553 --> 01:17:33.124
You have to get from there.

01:17:36.237 --> 01:17:38.318
Evil can be contagious.

01:18:02.084 --> 01:18:03.322
Hι where are you going, buddy?

01:18:04.146 --> 01:18:05.084
To bed.

01:18:06.268 --> 01:18:07.308
See you, Dad.

01:18:07.810 --> 01:18:09.625
Maybe we can just say goodnight
, Gene.

01:18:10.872 --> 01:18:11.859
I know.

01:18:12.994 --> 01:18:14.351
But this time it's "goodbye".

01:18:26.728 --> 01:18:28.911
I never knew puppets could be spooky

01:18:29.011 --> 01:18:30.217
Or possessed.

01:18:30.241 --> 01:18:33.015
When a soul finds its way
in the heart of a house

01:18:33.535 --> 01:18:35.734
Is a doll or toy
the perfect host.

01:18:35.937 --> 01:18:38.455
Evil disguised as innocence.

01:18:39.100 --> 01:18:40.763
No one would suspect anything.

01:18:41.864 --> 01:18:45.314
And the evil spirit in the pop
I mean, you know who he is?

01:18:45.447 --> 01:18:48.210
Honey, do not wor
talking about here, it's...

01:18:48.234 --> 01:18:51.370
Stop me underrated, I'm fine.

01:18:52.275 --> 01:18:53.574
Okι.

01:18:53.796 --> 01:18:57.091
I left a psychic come
to do a reading in the home.

01:18:57.680 --> 01:18:58.931
And they told us that the doll ever

01:18:58.966 --> 01:19:00.946
Far belonged to a child
named Robert Crow.

01:19:02.164 --> 01:19:03.453
He was murdered.

01:19:04.446 --> 01:19:06.165
His body was found in a river...

01:19:06.890 --> 01:19:08.279
He is still attached to the doll.

01:19:09.252 --> 01:19:10.798
The police investigation

01:19:11.930 --> 01:19:15.222
Revealed that Robert was murdered by his father.

01:19:15.377 --> 01:19:19.344
After Robert's death was the doll to his nephew

01:19:20.582 --> 01:19:23.064
Who named it after his family.

01:19:23.088 --> 01:19:24.161
And, uh...

01:19:25.206 --> 01:19:28.117
She soon realized
possessed doll...

01:19:28.718 --> 01:19:30.732
By the ghost of the murdered boy.

01:19:32.194 --> 01:19:35.653
They put him in an attic and
spirit remained there for years.

01:19:36.438 --> 01:19:40.290
Agatha moved to the house
Robert Crow's cousin

01:19:40.401 --> 01:19:42.292
And she found the doll in the attic.

01:19:43.137 --> 01:19:48.005
The Prophet said... Agatha
was a restless soul

01:19:48.029 --> 01:19:50.567
And had experimented with the dark cards.

01:19:51.754 --> 01:19:56.136
She went straight to the spirit
and it gave the power to manifest.

01:19:57.859 --> 01:20:01.941
My son says... Robert
my husband and I can not.

01:20:04.787 --> 01:20:05.962
Course.

01:20:06.388 --> 01:20:08.390
Because the mind to proceed.

01:20:10.025 --> 01:20:12.540
Robert Doll has something against other dolls.

01:20:13.495 --> 01:20:16.638
When he was confirmed a child
that he could be very possessive.

01:20:17.239 --> 01:20:19.678
Jenn, you and your husband are
in great danger.

01:20:20.281 --> 01:20:21.991
I locked him in the barn.

01:20:22.015 --> 01:20:24.233
That's not enough to stop this
haunts.

01:20:27.449 --> 01:20:31.833
You should go home and
destroy the doll.

01:20:31.857 --> 01:20:34.250
Chop it, shred it, burn it,
do what you gotta do

01:20:34.285 --> 01:20:35.805
To destroy it.

01:20:35.829 --> 01:20:37.217
Whether it will destroy you!

01:21:41.052 --> 01:21:43.644
Oh, come on!

01:21:50.575 --> 01:21:51.488

01:21:52.970 --> 01:21:53.923

01:21:53.935 --> 01:21:55.179

Gene.

01:22:17.379 --> 01:22:18.146
Gene?

01:22:18.883 --> 01:22:19.974

But you have to open the door!

01:22:57.319 --> 01:22:58.944
Gene, open the door!

01:23:02.077 --> 01:23:03.128

Honey, please.

01:23:21.102 --> 01:23:22.272
No!

01:23:24.713 --> 01:23:25.906
No!

01:23:43.244 --> 01:23:44.992
No, please, no.

01:23:54.080 --> 01:23:54.921
HΙ!

01:24:05.988 --> 01:24:07.829
Okι, okι.

01:24:08.791 --> 01:24:10.043
It's all good.

01:24:11.430 --> 01:24:12.332
It's all good.

01:24:14.036 --> 01:24:15.413
It's okay.

01:24:17.714 --> 01:24:19.128
It's good.

01:24:22.129 --> 01:24:23.242
Gene.
Gene?

01:24:23.246 --> 01:24:25.786
Gene!
Gene, my boy.

01:24:26.863 --> 01:24:28.061
Oh, dear.

01:24:28.657 --> 01:24:31.714
Everything will be fine.
He's dead ..

01:24:40.921 --> 01:24:45.476
THREE WEEKS LATER

01:25:15.257 --> 01:25:17.129
I'm going to take a bath.

01:25:18.340 --> 01:25:19.463
Is it?

01:25:21.043 --> 01:25:22.124
I'm fine.

01:25:23.345 --> 01:25:25.975
Things will be different from now on.
You know that right?

01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:43.170
No!

01:27:48.319 --> 01:27:50.574
