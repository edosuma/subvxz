WEBVTT

00:58.141 --> 00:59.017
Chief Hong.

00:59.100 --> 01:00.226
Yes?

01:01.186 --> 01:02.520
About…

01:03.688 --> 01:05.315
that night…

01:07.525 --> 01:09.152
Are you sure nothing happened?

01:11.404 --> 01:13.948
Yes. Nothing happened.

01:15.700 --> 01:16.576
Really?

01:18.536 --> 01:19.537
Yes.

01:28.630 --> 01:30.757
I have somewhere to be, so I'll get going.

02:10.004 --> 02:11.422
Hye-jin, you're losing it.

02:13.591 --> 02:15.760
Why don't you have the lights on?

02:18.138 --> 02:19.973
What? Hey.

02:26.020 --> 02:27.355
Is anything the matter?

02:28.356 --> 02:29.482
What's wrong?

02:33.194 --> 02:34.195
What is it?

02:38.616 --> 02:39.576
A kiss?

02:40.285 --> 02:44.622
Is that why you looked like
your whole world had burned down?

02:44.706 --> 02:46.291
I thought the clinic was done for.

02:46.374 --> 02:49.502
Hey, don't jinx us.
Take it back and knock on wood.

02:50.170 --> 02:51.171
There.

02:51.254 --> 02:53.423
I understand the power of liquid courage,

02:53.506 --> 02:55.758
but you're not one to instigate a kiss.

02:55.842 --> 02:57.385
I must not have been myself.

02:58.761 --> 03:00.930
Have I been out of the dating game
for too long?

03:01.014 --> 03:02.974
No, I should cut back on drinking.

03:03.057 --> 03:04.142
What did he say?

03:04.225 --> 03:05.351
Don't ask.

03:06.144 --> 03:09.147
He obviously remembers
but is playing dumb.

03:09.230 --> 03:12.775
I get it now.
That's why you're feeling so down.

03:12.859 --> 03:13.985
Hardly!

03:14.068 --> 03:17.530
As if. I can see right through you.

03:18.239 --> 03:20.742
I'm only asking out of pure curiosity,

03:20.825 --> 03:23.161
-but what do you think of Chief Hong?
-What?

03:23.244 --> 03:27.582
I mean, it's been a while since I saw you
bothered by a guy like this.

03:28.583 --> 03:30.251
If you have feelings for him…

03:30.919 --> 03:32.795
-This is bad.
-What?

03:33.379 --> 03:36.215
The fact that
I'm getting this nonsense from you

03:36.299 --> 03:38.134
proves the fault in my actions.

03:38.635 --> 03:41.679
I've been letting myself
get too comfortable here.

03:42.430 --> 03:44.015
There's no need to go that far.

03:44.098 --> 03:45.683
This won't ever happen again.

03:46.351 --> 03:50.146
From now on,
I won't ever get involved with Chief Hong.

03:50.730 --> 03:53.274
-Is that so?
-Never.

04:11.376 --> 04:13.086
KISS

04:15.255 --> 04:18.841
A FIRST KISS TASTES LIKE MUD,
SUNLIGHT, AND ROSES.

05:42.925 --> 05:45.011
An iced latte with lots of ice and syrup.

05:51.768 --> 05:52.852
COFFEE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY
AND BEER IN THE MOONLIGHT

05:59.025 --> 06:00.526
Hey, good morning.

06:02.320 --> 06:04.781
-Where's Mr. Oh?
-He's on his way.

06:04.864 --> 06:07.325
A latte for Ms. Pyo
and an iced Americano for you, right?

06:07.408 --> 06:09.410
The new beans
that came in are to die for--

06:09.494 --> 06:10.369
I want something else.

06:10.453 --> 06:11.788
Sure. Take your time then.

06:12.538 --> 06:15.458
You were worried you'd have a cold.
Are you feeling okay?

06:16.209 --> 06:18.795
What's it to you?
I can take care of myself.

06:18.878 --> 06:20.421
I'm just worried, that's all.

06:20.505 --> 06:22.048
Why would you worry about me?

06:22.131 --> 06:24.008
Am I not allowed to worry anymore?

06:24.926 --> 06:27.428
I get that being nosy is incurable,

06:27.512 --> 06:29.764
but I'd appreciate less of your concern.

06:30.348 --> 06:31.891
It's uncomfortable and annoying.

06:31.974 --> 06:35.144
Ms. Dentist,
that really hurts my feelings--

06:35.228 --> 06:38.106
I don't care if it's only a pop quiz!

06:38.773 --> 06:40.525
What's with this grade?

06:40.608 --> 06:45.279
This is all because you only think about
that no-good boy band.

06:45.363 --> 06:48.282
Yell at me all you want,
but don't badmouth my sacred DOS.

06:48.366 --> 06:49.700
What's with you?

06:49.784 --> 06:53.871
What? If you care about me
half as much as you do for them,

06:53.955 --> 06:55.790
you'd never get a grade like this!

06:55.873 --> 06:57.708
How about a quarter of a quarter?

06:58.918 --> 07:01.879
-Twenty points? Ju-ri.
-Give it here. It's mine!

07:01.963 --> 07:02.964
You saw that, right?

07:03.047 --> 07:05.383
-She's driving me crazy.
-That hurts!

07:05.466 --> 07:07.927
-You. Sit right here.
-Why?

07:08.010 --> 07:10.138
Can you two please talk to her?

07:10.221 --> 07:12.306
Tell her how crucial school grades are--

07:12.390 --> 07:13.683
As if they're important.

07:13.766 --> 07:16.269
What she wants to do with her life counts.

07:16.352 --> 07:17.562
You prick.

07:17.645 --> 07:19.981
Nothing matters more to a student.

07:20.773 --> 07:22.108
It's good to have dreams,

07:22.191 --> 07:24.694
but in most cases,

07:24.777 --> 07:28.156
you need a college degree to achieve it.
That's how it works in Korea.

07:29.282 --> 07:32.702
Dr. Yoon, I can't believe
we're on the same page!

07:32.785 --> 07:34.162
Ju-ri, you heard her.

07:34.245 --> 07:36.664
I need to go to work, so may I order?

07:36.747 --> 07:38.708
Gosh, silly me. What can I get you?

07:38.791 --> 07:41.711
An iced Americano
and an iced latte, please.

07:41.794 --> 07:44.547
-Du-sik, did you get that?
-Could you make it yourself?

07:44.630 --> 07:45.465
Me?

07:47.884 --> 07:48.843
Should I?

07:48.926 --> 07:50.595
Sure. Why not?

07:51.721 --> 07:53.097
Then…

07:53.181 --> 07:55.600
-His coffee sucks.
-I wonder if she'll like it.

07:55.683 --> 07:58.561
-I'll get going then.
-Sure thing. Thanks for today!

07:58.644 --> 08:01.355
Ju-ri, listen to her.

08:01.439 --> 08:04.984
-Look at that. Don't wander off.
-Dad…

08:11.240 --> 08:12.575
So she remembers.

08:15.703 --> 08:18.706
My coffee is much better now,

08:18.789 --> 08:20.291
you'll be pleasantly surprised.

08:22.251 --> 08:23.753
Dad, I want braces.

08:24.629 --> 08:25.838
Don't start.

08:25.922 --> 08:27.465
Then I'll study harder.

08:27.548 --> 08:28.841
-I promise.
-Don't study.

08:28.925 --> 08:30.676
My score will go from 20 to 200.

08:30.760 --> 08:33.262
I told you, that's not going to happen.

08:33.346 --> 08:35.973
Hye-jin, check this out.

08:36.057 --> 08:37.767
Will you really address me like that?

08:38.893 --> 08:41.479
-I saw it.
-Doesn't my snaggletooth need correcting?

08:41.562 --> 08:42.980
-Right?
-I already said no!

08:43.064 --> 08:43.898
Why not?

08:43.981 --> 08:46.567
The snaggletooth makes you look cute.

08:46.651 --> 08:48.486
It adds to your charm.

08:48.569 --> 08:50.821
Without it, you'd be a plain Jane.

08:50.905 --> 08:53.366
As if. You only say that
because it costs a lot.

08:53.449 --> 08:55.117
Hye-jin, take a look.

08:55.201 --> 08:58.120
Please give me your professional opinion.

08:58.204 --> 08:59.497
Okay.

09:00.706 --> 09:03.042
Snaggleteeth are corrected

09:03.125 --> 09:06.671
when they trap bits of food
or when they are at risk for cavities.

09:07.588 --> 09:09.507
But yours are adequately aligned

09:09.590 --> 09:11.175
and has been kept clean.

09:11.259 --> 09:14.971
If it's just to beautify yourself,
I don't recommend it.

09:15.054 --> 09:16.264
Gosh.

09:16.347 --> 09:17.765
And I thought you were cool.

09:18.349 --> 09:20.017
You're of no help. Out of my way!

09:20.101 --> 09:21.852
Dr. Yoon, that was unexpected.

09:22.395 --> 09:23.688
I'm so grateful.

09:23.771 --> 09:26.941
I absolutely love
everything you said today.

09:27.024 --> 09:29.902
You know what?
You coffee will be on the house today.

09:30.945 --> 09:33.489
Let me get some ice. My gosh.

09:38.911 --> 09:40.955
YOON DENTAL CLINIC
CHUNG-HO SCUBA DIVING

09:41.038 --> 09:43.249
According to the X-ray, it's all good.

09:45.751 --> 09:47.837
Just like I said last time,

09:47.920 --> 09:51.424
it seems the pain is coming from
the muscle above your molars.

09:51.507 --> 09:52.675
Is that all right?

09:52.758 --> 09:55.261
Of course. I'll prescribe you
a muscle relaxant

09:55.344 --> 09:57.930
as well as something
for the pain and inflammation.

09:58.014 --> 10:00.308
Stay medicated for a week

10:00.391 --> 10:02.560
and try to refrain
from eating anything chewy.

10:02.643 --> 10:03.477
I will.

10:03.978 --> 10:07.982
I'm glad I rented
the office space out to you.

10:08.065 --> 10:12.570
This is all because Chief Hong
gave you my slippers to wear.

10:13.696 --> 10:15.698
I'm guessing it was meant to be.

10:16.532 --> 10:17.700
I see.

10:18.826 --> 10:22.163
Please come back
if the pain doesn't subside after a week.

10:22.246 --> 10:24.498
-It should get better by then. Thank you.
-Sure.

10:24.582 --> 10:25.499
I'll get going now.

10:25.583 --> 10:27.501
-Have a good day.
-Take care.

10:28.836 --> 10:31.922
My gosh. A flower is going to bloom.

10:32.798 --> 10:34.342
What is this plant called?

10:34.425 --> 10:36.761
I'm not sure what it is.

10:36.844 --> 10:37.678
It's a fortune plant.

10:37.762 --> 10:40.139
-Is this a fortune plant?
-Yes.

10:40.222 --> 10:42.391
Water it though, will you?
The leaves are dry.

10:42.475 --> 10:44.977
Why do you have a plant
you don't know the name of?

10:45.061 --> 10:46.479
That's none of your business.

10:47.480 --> 10:48.356
Why are you here?

10:48.439 --> 10:50.232
You take walk-ins too, don't you?

11:03.663 --> 11:06.415
-I'm tilting your chair down.
-You sound like a real doctor.

11:06.499 --> 11:10.628
Sir, you're at a dental clinic.
Let's keep it professional.

11:10.711 --> 11:12.088
Even more so.

11:14.090 --> 11:17.301
I see that you're here for a checkup.

11:17.385 --> 11:19.929
Yes. I heard I should have
my teeth checked regularly.

11:20.012 --> 11:21.263
I'll take a look then.

11:33.859 --> 11:37.738
Wait. I hate it when my face is covered,
so go ahead without it.

11:40.032 --> 11:42.451
The lights are bright,
so at least close your eyes.

11:44.286 --> 11:45.913
Is it good now?

11:50.084 --> 11:50.918
Please open up.

11:53.421 --> 11:54.422
Now, bite down.

11:56.382 --> 11:57.425
And open.

11:58.092 --> 11:59.510
Please bite down again.

12:02.388 --> 12:04.390
Your teeth are in good shape.

12:04.473 --> 12:06.475
Has anything been troubling you?

12:06.559 --> 12:08.352
-Yes.
-Do tell.

12:08.436 --> 12:09.437
Our relationship.

12:13.774 --> 12:15.317
Is it because of that kiss?

12:20.030 --> 12:21.991
See? You're coughing now.

12:22.074 --> 12:24.452
This is exactly why I played dumb.

12:24.535 --> 12:25.953
-What?
-Just look at you.

12:26.036 --> 12:29.123
Because of a drunken mistake,
things are now awkward between us.

12:29.206 --> 12:32.084
People think that it's a big deal
only in Korea.

12:32.168 --> 12:33.669
It's not in other countries.

12:34.295 --> 12:35.838
On the other side of the globe,

12:35.921 --> 12:39.675
Jean and Chloe are probably
rubbing their cheeks and saying "<i>bonjour</i>".

12:40.176 --> 12:44.305
Besides, for two people of
the opposite sex to become good friends,

12:44.388 --> 12:47.099
we must be able
to move past a biological crisis.

12:47.183 --> 12:52.229
Which means we've been given a chance
to actually become true friends.

12:54.857 --> 12:55.983
Don't you need me?

12:56.984 --> 12:59.487
Your teeth and gums are in good condition.

13:00.029 --> 13:03.824
You'll be glad to know that your mouth
is free from a biological crisis.

13:03.908 --> 13:06.285
Ms. Pyo, please be thorough when scaling.

13:06.368 --> 13:07.203
-Sure.
-Wait.

13:07.286 --> 13:09.330
Just like that? I thought it was all good.

13:09.413 --> 13:13.000
You should still receive scaling
at least once a year.

13:14.543 --> 13:19.006
Then can you please make sure
it doesn't hurt?

13:19.089 --> 13:20.674
-Please lie down.
-Sure.

13:24.011 --> 13:26.263
-Lie down, please.
-Why didn't you lift this?

13:34.021 --> 13:36.440
Why can I taste
the disinfectant in the wind?

13:38.400 --> 13:40.736
I hope that resolves
any tension between us.

13:43.822 --> 13:44.698
Hello?

13:45.533 --> 13:46.659
Yes, this is he.

13:57.878 --> 14:00.422
Seriously.
That isn't a brick in front of you.

14:00.506 --> 14:02.967
Can't you enjoy it
so that I can enjoy mine too?

14:03.634 --> 14:04.635
It's good.

14:05.719 --> 14:07.012
So how did it go?

14:07.846 --> 14:09.890
Did you talk it out with Chief Hong?

14:09.974 --> 14:11.892
I purposely gave you some space.

14:11.976 --> 14:15.145
He acted like it was no big deal
and suggested we be friends.

14:15.229 --> 14:16.272
I see.

14:23.821 --> 14:25.823
And he must've meant it.

14:29.952 --> 14:30.870
What's this?

14:31.662 --> 14:33.330
-Is that Chief Hong?
-Yes.

14:33.414 --> 14:34.790
Is that a guy or a girl?

14:34.874 --> 14:35.749
A girl, of course.

14:46.135 --> 14:47.136
That prick.

14:47.219 --> 14:49.722
<i>Chief Hong is walking
with a woman along Gongjin Harbor.</i>

14:49.805 --> 14:50.723
<i>She's pretty.</i>

14:56.061 --> 14:58.022
<i>They're now on the beach.</i>

15:02.359 --> 15:03.903
<i>Judging by their body language,</i>

15:03.986 --> 15:08.782
<i>I'm guessing they're not
exactly lovey-dovey yet.</i>

15:08.866 --> 15:10.951
-The peninsula?
-The Korean Peninsula Waterway.

15:11.035 --> 15:12.244
If you see it upside down?

15:12.328 --> 15:14.204
-It's a famous spot here.
-I see.

15:22.379 --> 15:23.797
<i>Reporting from the observatory.</i>

15:23.881 --> 15:26.091
<i>Anyone can tell that they have chemistry.</i>

15:26.175 --> 15:28.552
<i>Dr. Yoon must not be on his mind.</i>

15:34.725 --> 15:38.354
Gosh. Them and their gossip.

15:38.854 --> 15:41.690
Jeez. I'm sick of it all.

16:14.223 --> 16:15.265
What the hell?

16:16.058 --> 16:18.894
-How long have you been here?
-For five minutes.

16:18.978 --> 16:20.270
I see.

16:21.814 --> 16:23.732
This is an official notice from OVN.

16:23.816 --> 16:25.109
Could you take a look?

16:25.192 --> 16:26.193
Right.

16:27.194 --> 16:32.658
What are they planning to do
after the singing contest?

16:36.120 --> 16:37.204
I have no clue.

16:37.287 --> 16:38.747
Anyway, I'll get back to work.

16:41.041 --> 16:41.959
Mr. Ban.

16:42.876 --> 16:43.711
Yes?

16:43.794 --> 16:45.796
What do you think it means

16:45.879 --> 16:48.882
when a person still keeps a gift
that was given 15 years ago?

16:48.966 --> 16:51.677
Either they love the gift
or it's that sturdy.

16:51.760 --> 16:53.137
No, not like that.

16:54.596 --> 16:55.597
I mean,

16:56.557 --> 16:59.268
doesn't it indicate a deeper meaning?

16:59.351 --> 17:03.272
Could it mean that the gift-giver
holds a place in their heart?

17:03.355 --> 17:05.024
Why does he even ask?

17:07.317 --> 17:10.195
<i>Seems to currently be heading
to Hwajeong Raw Fish Restaurant.</i>

17:10.279 --> 17:12.698
<i>Reporter Yeo, we expect an update.</i>

17:17.745 --> 17:19.872
Why is my ear itching all day?

17:21.540 --> 17:23.459
<i>-Thief!
-Ma'am…</i>

17:23.542 --> 17:25.127
<i>-No, I'm not a thief.
-As if.</i>

17:25.210 --> 17:27.296
<i>-Ma'am, that's not it.</i>
-Ms. Gam-ri, what is it?

17:27.379 --> 17:28.922
How are you not a thief?

17:29.006 --> 17:31.967
-My gosh.
-Gosh. He's a damn thief.

17:32.051 --> 17:34.470
Ma'am, you got the wrong idea.

17:34.553 --> 17:37.347
-What?
-Gosh, that hurts.

17:37.431 --> 17:38.891
-You?
-You?

17:42.394 --> 17:43.228
What?

17:45.773 --> 17:46.607
What's that?

17:49.276 --> 17:52.029
Housebreaking for you,
and assault for you.

17:52.112 --> 17:54.573
In the eyes of a third party,
you're both at fault.

17:54.656 --> 17:57.367
But since you took a hefty beating,

17:58.368 --> 18:01.580
Ms. Gam-ri is offering you
this meal as an apology.

18:01.663 --> 18:03.624
-Are you good with that?
-Of course.

18:03.707 --> 18:05.459
I caused the misunderstanding,

18:05.542 --> 18:08.170
so I'm grateful
for this meal you prepared.

18:08.253 --> 18:12.800
Get to the chatting later and dig in.

18:12.883 --> 18:14.426
-Sure.
-I'll enjoy this.

18:16.053 --> 18:20.849
From what Du-sik tells me, you film…

18:20.933 --> 18:22.976
-What was it again?
-<i>Mukbang</i> shows.

18:23.060 --> 18:24.937
-What?
-<i>Mukbang</i> shows.

18:25.020 --> 18:27.106
So that's what you do?

18:27.189 --> 18:28.816
Yes, something like that.

18:28.899 --> 18:29.942
Not that famous though.

18:30.025 --> 18:32.653
Right, I see.

18:32.736 --> 18:36.281
-I hope I didn't hurt you badly.
-I'm all right.

18:36.365 --> 18:39.868
It's what you get
for surprising me like that.

18:39.952 --> 18:42.538
You entered someone's house unannounced

18:42.621 --> 18:44.790
and stood there like some thief.

18:44.873 --> 18:47.126
So I hit you out of fear.

18:47.209 --> 18:49.753
I'm sorry about that.
I couldn't help myself

18:50.254 --> 18:52.631
when I saw this beautiful house.

18:52.714 --> 18:56.927
What do you mean, beautiful? It's just
an old house that an old woman lives in.

18:57.010 --> 18:58.929
Really. I mean it.

18:59.012 --> 19:01.849
It's the kind of house
I've been picturing.

19:01.932 --> 19:03.517
Humble and welcoming.

19:04.017 --> 19:06.436
If I had a grandma in the countryside,

19:06.520 --> 19:08.647
she'd live at a place like this.

19:08.730 --> 19:13.861
Goodness. You and your kind words.

19:13.944 --> 19:15.154
Try this too.

19:15.237 --> 19:18.031
She serves the best food in Gongjin.

19:18.115 --> 19:19.408
Goodness.

19:20.242 --> 19:21.076
How is it?

19:23.245 --> 19:24.830
It's absolutely delicious.

19:26.957 --> 19:29.418
Eat up. You must need more rice.

19:29.501 --> 19:31.837
-I'll get you some more.
-Sure.

19:35.841 --> 19:38.218
Why are you getting food
all over the place?

19:38.302 --> 19:40.721
I'm the clumsy type, you see.

19:41.388 --> 19:42.764
Hold on.

19:43.891 --> 19:45.392
Where is it? Here it is.

19:47.436 --> 19:49.188
-What? What's that?
-There.

19:53.442 --> 19:55.485
This is nice. It'll keep me clean and dry.

19:57.905 --> 19:59.156
-Please enjoy.
-You too.

19:59.865 --> 20:02.201
So you booked a place to stay?

20:02.284 --> 20:04.328
Yes. Parang Guesthouse.

20:04.411 --> 20:07.456
Parang Guesthouse? Right.
That's on the way to…

20:07.539 --> 20:08.916
Well, you wouldn't know.

20:10.042 --> 20:13.212
Listen carefully. From the intersection,

20:13.295 --> 20:14.963
-take a right.
-A right.

20:15.047 --> 20:16.840
-Then walk ten steps.
-Ten steps.

20:16.924 --> 20:19.635
-On the left is a real estate agency.
-A real estate agency.

20:19.718 --> 20:21.011
Ask for directions there.

20:21.511 --> 20:23.931
-What?
-You won't remember my directions.

20:25.766 --> 20:29.311
Got it. Anyway,
thank you for today as well.

20:29.394 --> 20:32.731
Don't mention it. I got to go now.
Get there safely.

20:32.814 --> 20:34.566
-Sure thing. Bye.
-Bye.

20:40.322 --> 20:43.242
He sure is a pure soul.

21:00.133 --> 21:01.760
To the right!

21:02.511 --> 21:03.637
The right…

21:04.721 --> 21:06.139
Whatever. I didn't see that.

21:10.602 --> 21:13.313
<i>I'll be late tonight,
so have dinner without me.</i>

21:13.397 --> 21:15.941
<i>I was offered a free skin care treatment.</i>

21:16.024 --> 21:19.444
All right. I'll see you later, Snow White.

21:20.696 --> 21:25.659
<i>That reminds me. Your friend took
his new friend to the observatory earlier.</i>

21:25.742 --> 21:27.828
Too much information isn't appreciated.

21:31.873 --> 21:33.333
What the hell am I going to eat?

21:33.959 --> 21:35.669
I hate everything in this small town,

21:35.752 --> 21:37.963
but especially the lack of delivery food.

21:39.423 --> 21:40.632
Damn it.

21:42.843 --> 21:44.594
-My gosh!
-My gosh.

21:45.595 --> 21:46.471
Who's there?

21:51.935 --> 21:55.230
Chun-jae, you didn't have
to wait for me outside, you know.

21:55.314 --> 21:56.273
-Du-sik.
-Yes?

21:56.356 --> 21:58.984
What am I going to do? I can't find Ju-ri.

21:59.067 --> 22:00.652
I'm sure she'll be back soon.

22:00.736 --> 22:03.947
It's not like that. The money's gone too.

22:04.031 --> 22:05.991
-What?
-What do I do?

22:06.575 --> 22:07.868
This is driving me nuts.

22:10.537 --> 22:11.496
You haven't seen her?

22:13.665 --> 22:17.044
Got it. Please call us
if you happen to see her.

22:17.127 --> 22:18.879
All right. Thanks.

22:19.379 --> 22:22.549
I locked the safe
after realizing some bills were missing,

22:22.632 --> 22:24.301
but she took the entire thing.

22:24.968 --> 22:27.596
How did she manage to carry it?

22:28.180 --> 22:29.765
I should call the police.

22:30.265 --> 22:31.433
-No.
-I should hurry.

22:31.516 --> 22:32.976
No need for that.

22:33.810 --> 22:36.396
I'm sure she's still somewhere in Gongjin.

22:45.447 --> 22:47.908
You're not here to ask an English question

22:48.992 --> 22:50.452
but to have a free meal.

22:51.620 --> 22:53.538
Hye-jin, can I have the neck?

22:54.122 --> 22:55.332
Go ahead.

22:57.542 --> 23:00.629
-Did you starve today?
-Yes, I had my reasons.

23:02.339 --> 23:04.633
-Slow down.
-Can I have some water?

23:11.973 --> 23:13.642
What the hell is this? Damn, my toes.

23:13.725 --> 23:15.811
-What's in here?
-It's nothing!

23:15.894 --> 23:17.312
-Don't.
-Let me see.

23:17.395 --> 23:18.814
My gosh.

23:18.897 --> 23:21.191
Is this a safe? Did you steal this?

23:21.274 --> 23:24.277
How can it be stealing
when it's from my dad's shop?

23:24.361 --> 23:25.904
That's still stealing.

23:25.987 --> 23:27.948
I said it's my dad's.

23:29.366 --> 23:30.700
Did you run away from home?

23:45.132 --> 23:46.383
Why are you here?

23:46.466 --> 23:48.510
It's not you I'm here to see.

23:49.469 --> 23:51.096
Is Ju-ri here by any chance?

23:52.389 --> 23:54.099
-Wh… What?
-You're stuttering.

23:56.226 --> 23:57.727
Excuse me for a bit.

23:57.811 --> 23:59.229
-But--
-Oh Ju-ri!

24:01.314 --> 24:04.234
Get over here.
Did you think I wouldn't find you?

24:04.317 --> 24:07.195
-I thought you wouldn't come looking here.
-How dare you--

24:07.279 --> 24:10.574
Gosh, that must hurt. Oh, dear.

24:10.657 --> 24:13.618
Do you know how worried
your dad and I were?

24:13.702 --> 24:16.246
How should I know?
Is this how it's going to be?

24:16.329 --> 24:17.998
-Get over here.
-No.

24:18.081 --> 24:19.833
-Get over here while I ask nicely.
-No.

24:19.916 --> 24:22.711
What do you think
you're doing in my house?

24:22.794 --> 24:23.920
Are you playing a game?

24:24.004 --> 24:26.965
You should've called
if a kid came by at this hour.

24:27.048 --> 24:28.383
Think about her father.

24:28.466 --> 24:30.594
-Are you seriously telling me off?
-Darn it.

24:30.677 --> 24:32.304
I only just found out.

24:33.805 --> 24:34.973
-Get back here.
-No.

24:35.056 --> 24:36.183
-Get back here.
-Why?

24:36.266 --> 24:37.267
-Get back here.
-No.

24:37.350 --> 24:39.644
-Get over here.
-Sorry, Hye-jin.

24:43.356 --> 24:44.649
Get out here, Ju-ri.

24:45.483 --> 24:47.068
-Get out here.
-No way.

24:47.152 --> 24:49.237
You shouldn't put others out like this.

24:49.738 --> 24:50.572
Get out here!

24:50.655 --> 24:52.908
The one causing inconvenience here is you.

24:52.991 --> 24:53.825
What?

24:53.909 --> 24:57.204
Ju-ri's my guest
while you weren't invited in.

24:57.287 --> 25:00.081
She can stay here tonight,
so please leave.

25:00.165 --> 25:01.708
But Chun-jae's waiting at home.

25:01.791 --> 25:03.752
I'll call him myself then.

25:03.835 --> 25:06.087
-Ju-ri, what's your dad's number?
-Don't tell her.

25:06.171 --> 25:09.132
Be quiet. It's 010-0247-8359.

25:09.216 --> 25:11.718
Seriously. What the hell are you doing?

25:12.219 --> 25:13.178
<i>Hello?</i>

25:13.261 --> 25:16.014
-Ju-ri will stay with me tonight.
-<i>Who the hell are you?</i>

25:17.224 --> 25:18.433
I informed her father,

25:18.516 --> 25:20.936
and I'm an adult of the same sex.
So it's no problem.

25:21.478 --> 25:24.064
There. Do you need anything else?

25:26.441 --> 25:29.236
Ju-ri, get back home tomorrow.

25:29.319 --> 25:32.155
-"Be back home tomorrow."
-Are you mocking me?

25:32.239 --> 25:34.074
Your dad is worried.

25:37.118 --> 25:38.245
Sorry for the intrusion.

25:59.140 --> 26:01.434
Hye-jin, is Uncle Du-sik gone?

26:01.518 --> 26:02.435
Yes.

26:02.519 --> 26:05.522
Nice, Hye-jin. Thank you so much.
I'm sorry for pushing you, but--

26:07.941 --> 26:10.151
I met Chief Hong on my way in.

26:11.486 --> 26:12.320
Who are you?

26:13.446 --> 26:14.572
You're rude.

26:15.115 --> 26:16.241
Who may you be?

26:16.866 --> 26:18.368
Who's asking?

26:19.160 --> 26:21.496
I'm Pyo Mi-seon.

26:23.081 --> 26:23.915
Who's she?

26:26.001 --> 26:28.878
What on earth is she thinking?

26:32.382 --> 26:34.009
-Hey, Chun-jae.
-<i>Du-sik!</i>

26:34.092 --> 26:38.096
<i>I think Ju-ri was kidnapped
by some crazy woman!</i>

26:44.728 --> 26:48.648
Yes, I'll let her stay the night
and bring her over tomorrow morning.

26:49.899 --> 26:51.860
Sure. Don't worry too much.

26:54.988 --> 26:55.822
Good night.

26:58.575 --> 26:59.826
What did my dad say?

26:59.909 --> 27:01.703
That you're dead meat tomorrow.

27:02.329 --> 27:04.039
-Now, go to bed.
-Okay.

27:06.708 --> 27:09.419
-Good night.
-You too, Hye-jin.

27:14.841 --> 27:18.011
RESEARCH ON THE SURVIVAL RATE
OF RE-EMBEDDED IMPLANTS

27:27.479 --> 27:29.064
JU-RI'S

27:40.950 --> 27:42.202
She's quite good.

27:52.712 --> 27:56.132
<i>Dr. Yoon, once again,
please take good care of my girl.</i>

27:57.008 --> 27:58.760
<i>Of course. Don't worry.</i>

28:01.888 --> 28:04.724
<i>I'm sorry to ask,
but did she wash up before bed?</i>

28:04.808 --> 28:08.853
<i>She can't skip lotion
due to her chronic atopic dermatitis.</i>

28:08.937 --> 28:11.815
<i>Yes, she didn't forget
to put on some lotion.</i>

28:14.317 --> 28:17.070
<i>You probably have this covered,</i>

28:17.153 --> 28:19.739
<i>but please make sure
she brushes her teeth.</i>

28:25.537 --> 28:28.581
<i>She may not seem fussy,
but she doesn't sleep well in other beds.</i>

28:29.165 --> 28:30.583
<i>If she can't sleep,</i>

28:30.667 --> 28:34.045
<i>please give her a glass of milk
with a spoonful of sugar.</i>

28:37.674 --> 28:40.593
Hye-jin, I can't sleep.

28:44.848 --> 28:46.266
Drink this and head to bed.

28:46.349 --> 28:47.517
Sure.

28:47.600 --> 28:48.977
That's nice and warm.

28:49.561 --> 28:53.314
By the way, the girl
in the photos in your room. Is it you?

28:53.898 --> 28:54.774
Yes.

28:55.900 --> 28:57.610
The years weren't so nice to you.

28:58.486 --> 29:00.613
Hey. Seriously?

29:00.697 --> 29:03.283
All living creatures
look better when young.

29:04.993 --> 29:08.413
I heard that your mother passed away
and you only have a father like me.

29:09.664 --> 29:11.166
Rumors travel fast.

29:12.959 --> 29:14.836
Do you remember a lot about her?

29:15.336 --> 29:16.963
Somewhat.

29:17.881 --> 29:19.549
However, I was too young,

29:20.175 --> 29:22.093
so I mostly remember her being sick.

29:22.177 --> 29:24.220
You at least have some memories of her.

29:26.139 --> 29:28.850
My mom passed away right after I was born,

29:28.933 --> 29:30.810
so I only got to see photos of her.

29:32.729 --> 29:33.730
Really?

29:33.813 --> 29:36.608
So my grandma used to say
when I was little

29:37.275 --> 29:38.568
that I ruined my dad's life.

29:39.486 --> 29:40.612
He got so mad at her

29:41.279 --> 29:43.490
that we only see her only on holidays.

29:47.744 --> 29:49.996
I get that he cares so much about me,

29:50.830 --> 29:53.625
but it's stifling at times and annoying.

29:54.334 --> 29:55.251
So it's like this.

29:56.377 --> 29:59.047
He should only be a dad,

29:59.130 --> 30:01.257
but he's trying to be a mom too.

30:01.841 --> 30:02.884
Do you get what I mean?

30:03.510 --> 30:04.552
Yes, totally.

30:07.138 --> 30:09.724
Hye-jin, why did you
let me stay here today?

30:11.392 --> 30:12.393
No reason.

30:13.686 --> 30:15.230
It just reminded me of the past.

30:18.107 --> 30:19.651
I was once like you too.

30:19.734 --> 30:21.444
Like me?

30:22.403 --> 30:24.697
No way. Did you run away from home too?

30:25.490 --> 30:26.366
Why?

30:26.866 --> 30:28.660
It was back in high school.

30:29.285 --> 30:30.995
GONGJIN MARKET PARKING LOT

30:32.038 --> 30:34.123
<i>I skipped school,</i>

30:34.833 --> 30:36.668
<i>took a bus at the terminal,</i>

30:37.836 --> 30:38.920
<i>and went to the beach.</i>

30:44.008 --> 30:46.219
Long distance! You play big, don't you?

30:46.928 --> 30:48.012
Why though?

30:50.181 --> 30:54.060
Because my dad
had gotten himself a girlfriend.

30:54.143 --> 30:57.021
No way! Was that your reason?

30:57.647 --> 30:59.983
I didn't peg you to be so close-minded.

31:01.109 --> 31:03.945
Look. If my dad were seeing a woman,

31:04.028 --> 31:06.364
I'd back up their relationship
all the way.

31:06.447 --> 31:07.323
What?

31:07.991 --> 31:09.284
It's kind of sad

31:10.076 --> 31:12.495
to let him live forever
missing a dead person.

31:12.579 --> 31:16.207
Gosh. You're definitely
more thoughtful than I am.

31:16.791 --> 31:19.711
I wonder why you left home
when you're this mature?

31:22.171 --> 31:24.966
That's because my dad
wouldn't let me get braces.

31:25.800 --> 31:29.637
So could you please persuade him a little?

31:29.721 --> 31:33.308
Why do you want braces
when your snaggletooth is adorable?

31:33.391 --> 31:37.020
Just like everyone else in this world,
I want to look pretty.

31:37.103 --> 31:39.063
I'm sure you understand that. Right?

31:39.856 --> 31:42.066
-Braces alone won't do the job.
-Jeez.

31:42.650 --> 31:45.778
That's straight in the guts. I'm so hurt.

31:45.862 --> 31:47.196
I hurt you?

31:47.280 --> 31:50.783
Here. Drink this and go to bed.
I need to get some work done.

31:54.537 --> 31:58.374
Doctor, do you offer
your friends any discount--

31:58.458 --> 31:59.876
-Go to bed.
-Got it.

31:59.959 --> 32:00.793
Darn.

32:04.631 --> 32:06.591
Good night. No, just a second.

32:06.674 --> 32:08.051
A discount…

32:08.134 --> 32:10.011
Got it. Good night.

32:41.501 --> 32:44.170
You always drink the good stuff
on your own.

32:56.307 --> 32:57.141
Chun-jae.

33:02.105 --> 33:03.106
Are you crying?

33:03.982 --> 33:05.817
Why would I be crying?

33:11.864 --> 33:15.868
Just wait until she gets back.
I'm shaving all her hair off.

33:15.952 --> 33:18.371
As if you'd ever go through with that.

33:19.038 --> 33:21.874
You adore the curly baby hair
on her forehead.

33:23.418 --> 33:26.462
I guess I love her so much
that I've spoiled her.

33:27.630 --> 33:29.382
I raised a thief.

33:30.383 --> 33:33.594
She plays big.
She definitely doesn't take after you.

33:34.345 --> 33:35.263
Maybe her mom.

33:37.807 --> 33:38.808
Jeez.

33:40.810 --> 33:43.813
What will become of her? I'm so worried.

33:45.398 --> 33:47.817
It's not like
I'm going to be around forever.

33:47.900 --> 33:50.737
In order to manage on her own
once I'm gone,

33:50.820 --> 33:52.989
she needs to at least finish college.

33:53.573 --> 33:56.492
Is that why you've been
on her case lately?

33:56.576 --> 33:57.952
It's the same with the braces.

33:58.453 --> 34:00.329
Of course, I asked around.

34:00.830 --> 34:03.374
-Since she wants it so badly.
-But?

34:04.876 --> 34:07.712
It involves plucking
a few perfectly good teeth!

34:07.795 --> 34:11.049
Even when she scrapes her knee,
it gives me a heart attack.

34:11.132 --> 34:13.342
What if something happens
during the procedure?

34:13.426 --> 34:16.596
Ju-ri's such a lucky kid
to have a dad like you.

34:16.679 --> 34:19.140
Those without parents
should feel sorry for themselves.

34:25.271 --> 34:26.773
Don't be ridiculous.

34:27.899 --> 34:31.235
You grew up well on your own, you know.

34:32.403 --> 34:35.323
No one in this world is as decent as you.

34:35.406 --> 34:37.533
Hold on. Are you drunk?

34:39.911 --> 34:40.912
Du-sik.

34:43.081 --> 34:45.500
Try and make something happen
with Dr. Yoon.

34:45.583 --> 34:47.585
Stop it. It's not like that for us.

34:47.668 --> 34:51.297
Don't say that to Ms. Dentist either.
You'll lose a regular customer.

34:51.380 --> 34:53.716
Then date someone at least.

34:54.550 --> 34:56.135
Find someone to lean on for once.

34:57.470 --> 35:00.264
You spend your life
dealing with people's baggage.

35:00.348 --> 35:03.518
When do you ever get to lessen yours?

35:04.644 --> 35:05.895
I don't have any.

35:05.978 --> 35:08.523
You almost finished the bottle.
Let me get a glass.

35:09.398 --> 35:12.235
Don't you dare drink another drop.
I'm finishing that.

35:13.111 --> 35:14.779
Jeez.

35:42.056 --> 35:44.934
That drink sure was strong.

36:11.210 --> 36:14.213
<i>WHAT MEN LIVE BY</i> BY LEO TOLSTOY

36:43.659 --> 36:45.328
COFFEE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY
AND BEER IN THE MOONLIGHT

36:47.914 --> 36:51.459
I'm sorry. I won't ever do this again.

36:52.460 --> 36:54.503
So please let me have my braces.

36:55.213 --> 36:56.631
-Please?
-No.

36:57.256 --> 36:59.425
Now that you pulled this, there's no way.

36:59.508 --> 37:02.720
You can no longer get what you want
by acting out.

37:02.803 --> 37:05.723
I hate you. You're super annoying!

37:05.806 --> 37:07.767
Likewise! It's not like I…

37:07.850 --> 37:09.185
That brat.

37:10.436 --> 37:14.398
I'm sorry, doctor.
And thank you for last night.

37:15.066 --> 37:15.942
It's all right.

37:16.025 --> 37:18.569
She's not usually this bad, but…

37:19.403 --> 37:23.658
Jeez. Raising a daughter sure isn't easy.

37:23.741 --> 37:27.203
I may be overstepping my boundaries,

37:27.787 --> 37:30.081
but Ju-ri's not a little kid anymore.

37:30.665 --> 37:33.209
-Sorry?
-Yes, she's still a child,

37:33.292 --> 37:38.172
but she's past the age where she needs
constant care from her dad.

37:38.881 --> 37:43.302
She has her own world now
and needs her alone time.

37:44.095 --> 37:47.723
I just hope you can accept
those changes in her life.

37:47.807 --> 37:49.225
Right.

37:49.308 --> 37:52.270
And Ju-ri isn't some mindless teenager.

37:52.353 --> 37:54.146
She already found what she wants to do.

37:54.230 --> 37:55.982
Have you seen her sketches?

37:56.607 --> 37:58.985
-It's Ju-ri's.
-Does Ju-ri draw?

38:02.113 --> 38:04.949
-Is this hers?
-Yes, she drew those.

38:05.032 --> 38:06.492
Did my Ju-ri--

38:06.575 --> 38:08.160
-Did you get rid of them?
-What?

38:08.244 --> 38:11.497
My DOS poster and fan merchandise.
Did you get rid of them?

38:11.580 --> 38:13.207
Yes, I threw them away.

38:13.291 --> 38:16.168
I couldn't take you
losing focus over them,

38:16.252 --> 38:17.712
so I threw them all out!

38:17.795 --> 38:20.339
Why would you throw out what's mine?

38:20.423 --> 38:23.551
Who gave you the right?
Those were all limited editions!

38:23.634 --> 38:25.344
It's never good to get involved.

38:35.062 --> 38:37.982
My gosh. Chief Hong's
spending the day with her again.

38:41.068 --> 38:42.069
I guess so.

38:44.113 --> 38:45.656
I'm stopping by the supermarket.

38:53.289 --> 38:55.708
-Welcome!
-Hi.

38:58.586 --> 39:01.380
I'll take all of these.

39:03.257 --> 39:05.009
-All of them?
-Yes.

39:06.093 --> 39:07.636
You must love them.

39:08.387 --> 39:12.099
They make good snacks,
although I did use to live on them.

39:13.309 --> 39:14.435
I see.

39:16.228 --> 39:21.359
<i>So Producer Ji,
where are we headed this time…</i>

39:21.442 --> 39:22.526
Hello!

39:22.610 --> 39:23.652
Welcome.

39:26.822 --> 39:28.616
Do you have any sausages?

39:29.283 --> 39:31.827
Actually, someone bought
all I had just now.

39:32.370 --> 39:36.374
Gosh. I see I'm not the only one
who loves them.

39:36.457 --> 39:38.084
I'll be back some other time then.

39:38.167 --> 39:39.794
Yes, have a nice day.

39:39.877 --> 39:41.003
Sure.

39:44.465 --> 39:46.008
Why does he look familiar?

39:47.343 --> 39:48.677
He's not from Gongjin.

39:49.845 --> 39:51.806
Where did I see him?

39:52.556 --> 39:54.725
<i>Is Uigeumbu the name of a region?</i>

39:55.434 --> 39:56.477
<i>Isn't that Uijeongbu?</i>

39:56.560 --> 39:59.897
<i>Uigeumbu and</i> seolleongtang.
<i>Don't they ring any bells?</i>

39:59.980 --> 40:00.981
<i>Nothing.</i>

40:21.001 --> 40:22.711
I see they have a dental clinic here.

CHUNG-HO SCUBA DIVING

40:32.638 --> 40:35.850
-Octopus over rice?
-Yes, the place nearby is to die for.

40:35.933 --> 40:38.227
Really? Sounds delicious.

40:39.103 --> 40:41.480
Chun-jae, why didn't you bring Ju-ri?

40:41.564 --> 40:43.274
She's giving me the silent treatment.

40:43.357 --> 40:45.818
And World War 3 is imminent.

40:45.901 --> 40:48.404
-She's just a kid.
-You being here

40:48.487 --> 40:50.322
makes your move finally feel real.

40:50.406 --> 40:51.699
I feel the same way.

40:53.159 --> 40:55.244
Hwa-jeong, are you feeling better today?

40:55.327 --> 40:57.663
Yes, I'm fine now.

40:57.746 --> 40:59.331
Thanks for the concern.

40:59.915 --> 41:01.167
Hello.

41:01.250 --> 41:03.711
-Gosh, hello.
-Hello.

41:03.794 --> 41:05.629
-Come on in.
-Hi!

41:05.713 --> 41:07.131
-This way.
-Please sit.

41:07.214 --> 41:08.674
I see there's an empty seat.

41:08.757 --> 41:09.592
Where?

41:09.675 --> 41:11.302
Right here.

41:11.385 --> 41:13.471
There's barely any room.

41:13.554 --> 41:15.473
Gosh, there we go.

41:17.600 --> 41:19.727
Before we begin today's meeting,

41:19.810 --> 41:22.188
a message for the village
will be delivered.

41:22.688 --> 41:23.647
Village Chief?

41:25.733 --> 41:29.987
Hello, everyone. I'm Chang Yeong-guk,
the Village Chief of Gongjin-dong.

41:30.571 --> 41:34.241
Take it easy, will you?
There's no need to deepen your voice.

41:36.535 --> 41:37.536
Right.

41:38.621 --> 41:41.415
I'm sure you know the Lighthouse
Song Festival's in two weeks.

41:41.499 --> 41:43.375
I hope many sign up again this year.

41:43.459 --> 41:45.753
I'll hand out applications,
so fill them out

41:45.836 --> 41:47.880
-and bring them to the office.
-Sure.

41:49.882 --> 41:52.718
Hold on. Up until last year,
the award included

41:52.801 --> 41:54.595
a voucher to spend locally.

41:54.678 --> 41:57.014
But this year,
the winner gets three million won.

41:57.097 --> 41:59.141
-What?
-In cash?

41:59.225 --> 42:01.936
-Yes.
-You'll be given hard cash.

42:02.019 --> 42:03.938
Runner-up, 1,000,000.
Third place, 500,000.

42:04.021 --> 42:05.189
-My goodness!
-No way.

42:05.272 --> 42:07.191
-Unbelievable.
-Nice.

42:07.274 --> 42:09.360
So I hope many will enter the competition.

42:09.443 --> 42:11.445
Don't if you're too busy though.

42:11.529 --> 42:13.781
Only do so if you want.
Here are the forms.

42:14.281 --> 42:16.283
Officer Choi, are you not entering?

42:16.367 --> 42:17.701
I'm afraid not.

42:17.785 --> 42:19.370
Why not?

42:19.453 --> 42:21.789
Chief Hong, go ahead.
You can carry a tune.

42:21.872 --> 42:23.582
Sing what you sang last time.

42:23.666 --> 42:28.295
She's right. You and Dr. Yoon can team up.

42:28.379 --> 42:30.422
Again with the nonsense.

42:30.506 --> 42:34.760
How can you be so dense
and embarrass people like that?

42:34.843 --> 42:37.721
Can't you tell by the way
they're sitting far apart?

42:37.805 --> 42:39.723
It's already over between them.

42:39.807 --> 42:40.808
Gosh.

42:40.891 --> 42:43.060
What's there to end

42:43.811 --> 42:45.437
when nothing even began?

42:46.188 --> 42:48.357
Nothing's going on
between Chief Hong and me.

42:48.941 --> 42:51.610
If you keep spreading false rumors,

42:52.319 --> 42:53.445
I won't let it slide.

42:53.529 --> 42:54.446
Well…

42:55.573 --> 42:57.575
-I…
-Gosh.

42:59.702 --> 43:00.619
I'm leaving.

43:01.203 --> 43:02.746
-What?
-What…

43:02.830 --> 43:04.039
-Wait.
-Hye-jin.

43:04.123 --> 43:05.124
-What…
-Is she pissed?

43:05.207 --> 43:06.834
-Well…
-Just a second.

43:06.917 --> 43:08.877
They were close but sat far apart today,

43:09.461 --> 43:11.422
so I just figured…

43:18.304 --> 43:19.513
Just let it slide.

43:20.097 --> 43:22.266
The gossip just to kill the time.

43:23.142 --> 43:25.227
Why does it have to be at my expense?

43:25.811 --> 43:28.188
It's upsetting and I'm offended.

43:28.272 --> 43:31.191
As long as it's not true,
there's no need to overreact.

43:31.775 --> 43:35.070
Let's not be so sharp around the edges.
That's my advice as a friend.

43:35.779 --> 43:37.072
Who says we're friends?

43:37.156 --> 43:38.365
What?

43:38.449 --> 43:40.868
Us having some moments recently

43:40.951 --> 43:43.370
must've made you think that way,

43:43.912 --> 43:46.957
-but I don't befriend just anyone.
-"Just anyone"?

43:47.041 --> 43:49.585
While we're at it,
let me lay it out there.

43:50.169 --> 43:51.754
You exhaust me.

43:51.837 --> 43:55.507
I don't care for the rumors
and prefer not to be considered as a pair.

43:56.008 --> 43:59.720
I'm grateful for your help, but I'd like
for you to stop crossing the line.

44:01.722 --> 44:03.140
I thought you had changed.

44:04.933 --> 44:06.185
I guess I was wrong.

44:11.273 --> 44:12.274
Here you go.

44:43.931 --> 44:45.140
<i>Power on.</i>

44:46.016 --> 44:47.685
<i>Bluetooth activated.</i>

44:47.768 --> 44:51.230
Why don't we enter
the singing contest as a team?

44:52.272 --> 44:54.358
You know I'm a natural on stage.

44:54.441 --> 44:56.360
Give me a chance and I'll shine.

44:56.443 --> 44:57.486
Enough!

44:57.569 --> 45:01.615
Would it kill you
to live quietly for once?

45:01.698 --> 45:03.700
Mat-i, let it be just us two then.

45:03.784 --> 45:06.453
We can split the prize money.
What do you say?

45:11.708 --> 45:13.168
Gosh, must be a cold.

45:15.963 --> 45:17.047
Hey.

45:18.048 --> 45:20.384
-Do I know you?
-It's Nam-suk. Hold on.

45:21.844 --> 45:22.803
I knew it was you.

45:22.886 --> 45:24.513
-Gosh, hello.
-Hi.

45:24.596 --> 45:27.599
Don't tell me
you're here to enter the singing contest.

45:27.683 --> 45:29.101
Nonsense.

45:30.060 --> 45:33.021
Goodness. I was right.

45:33.105 --> 45:35.816
It's wrong for someone like you to enter.

45:35.899 --> 45:37.734
You're a singer. It's not fair.

45:37.818 --> 45:39.236
Must you talk so loudly?

45:39.319 --> 45:40.529
Gosh, I'm sorry.

45:40.612 --> 45:42.781
Is it because of the big prize money?

45:42.865 --> 45:45.701
Nam-suk, why is it that you're everywhere?

45:45.784 --> 45:47.119
-Nam-suk.
-Gosh.

45:47.202 --> 45:48.996
Is she the mayor or something?

45:49.746 --> 45:51.498
Listen up, everyone!

45:51.582 --> 45:54.543
Oh Yoon who won the number two song
on <i>Top Ten Songs</i>

45:54.626 --> 45:56.587
will enter the Lighthouse Song Festival.

45:56.670 --> 45:59.214
How is that fair?

46:01.508 --> 46:02.509
Chun--

46:03.594 --> 46:05.512
I took care of him.

46:05.596 --> 46:06.805
-Here's my form.
-Sure.

46:06.889 --> 46:08.307
I have 320,000 won.

46:17.816 --> 46:19.526
Unbelievable.

46:21.570 --> 46:22.821
Gosh.

46:33.332 --> 46:34.541
LIGHTHOUSE SONG FESTIVAL

46:47.471 --> 46:49.014
CHUNG-HO SPECIALTY PRODUCTS

46:51.016 --> 46:51.975
LIGHTHOUSE SONG FESTIVAL

46:52.059 --> 46:55.187
-Let's go.
-I don't want to.

46:55.270 --> 46:58.023
Who watches singing contests these days?
They're so lame.

46:58.106 --> 47:01.652
Come on! Do you really think
I'm here for the contest?

47:01.735 --> 47:04.404
Of course, I'm here
to bump into Eun-cheol.

47:04.488 --> 47:06.114
Jeez.

47:06.198 --> 47:07.282
Seriously.

47:08.617 --> 47:10.494
Hey, Chief Hong!

47:13.664 --> 47:14.957
-Hi.
-Hey.

47:15.040 --> 47:16.750
Have you seen Officer Choi?

47:16.833 --> 47:19.002
He's sorting things out
by the parking lot.

47:19.086 --> 47:21.630
He said he was off-duty today. How come?

47:21.713 --> 47:23.840
A fender bender made a mess of things.

47:24.341 --> 47:27.177
I'm not sure he'll make it here on time,
but don't lose hope.

47:27.261 --> 47:28.637
Okay.

47:52.369 --> 47:54.538
-Hi.
-Cho-hui, over here.

47:56.039 --> 47:58.333
That seat's taken. It's Hwa-jeong's.

47:58.417 --> 48:00.627
What do you mean?
I've been saving it for her…

48:01.420 --> 48:02.754
Hold on. What…

48:04.089 --> 48:06.216
It's fine. I can move over a seat.

48:07.259 --> 48:08.260
Hey.

48:09.094 --> 48:12.222
She doesn't even know
when people do her a favor.

48:13.765 --> 48:15.601
-Please have a seat.
-Sit down.

48:15.684 --> 48:16.685
What's the matter?

48:16.768 --> 48:18.729
It's all good.

48:18.812 --> 48:19.646
What was that?

48:19.730 --> 48:21.106
It's nothing.

48:23.734 --> 48:26.278
What's with all the cameras
at a small-town festival?

48:27.237 --> 48:29.197
It wasn't like this last year.

48:30.157 --> 48:33.035
Maybe it's because of the prize money,
but it's a bit different.

48:33.118 --> 48:34.328
-Right?
-Yes.

48:34.411 --> 48:38.957
Hello, I'm comedian Yang Seung-won
here to host the Lighthouse Song Festival.

48:39.041 --> 48:41.501
-It's good to see you.
-It's Yang Seung-won!

48:41.585 --> 48:42.753
What?

48:42.836 --> 48:46.923
-I'll start with a few voice impressions.
-Isn't it that man on TV?

48:47.007 --> 48:48.550
-Yes, it is.
-Here we go.

48:48.634 --> 48:51.053
Before we begin the singing contest,

48:51.136 --> 48:53.096
an opening ceremony will be delivered.

48:53.180 --> 48:55.182
He's the pride and joy of Gongjin-dong.

48:55.265 --> 48:57.434
Please welcome singer Oh Yoon.

49:05.609 --> 49:07.694
Hello, everyone.

49:08.403 --> 49:11.365
-He actually agreed to it.
-A mountain guy

49:11.448 --> 49:14.618
turned out to be an ocean guy,
and that's how I settled here.

49:15.410 --> 49:17.663
I am the star of Gongjin.
What's my name again?

49:17.746 --> 49:18.872
-Chun-jae!
-Chun-jae!

49:18.955 --> 49:19.873
What's my name?

49:19.956 --> 49:21.166
-Oh Yoon!
-Oh Yoon!

49:21.249 --> 49:23.251
Yes, I'm Oh Yoon!

49:24.294 --> 49:27.381
Ju-ri, I love you!

49:31.760 --> 49:36.181
<i>The night is cold, I hate this night</i>

49:36.264 --> 49:40.477
<i>Here I am living in this city day by day</i>

49:40.560 --> 49:45.357
<i>But once again, I realize she's gone</i>

49:45.440 --> 49:49.111
<i>All that's left is an empty seat
And her laughter</i>

49:50.278 --> 49:54.157
<i>I can't contain this feeling</i>

49:54.991 --> 49:59.663
<i>Exercising in the moonlight doesn't help</i>

49:59.746 --> 50:04.126
<i>Only the wind of life that crashes into me</i>

50:04.209 --> 50:07.921
<i>Eventually brings me to tears</i>

50:08.004 --> 50:12.008
<i>But once again, I realize she's gone</i>

50:12.092 --> 50:16.138
<i>All that's left is an empty seat
And her laughter</i>

50:21.768 --> 50:23.270
Thank you. I love you all.

50:25.230 --> 50:26.606
I'm Oh Yoon!

50:28.525 --> 50:31.361
Ju-ri, it's your dad!

50:37.576 --> 50:40.954
No way. What's this?
A live guerrilla performance?

50:41.621 --> 50:43.331
It'll be over before then, right?

50:45.333 --> 50:47.753
Ju-ri, are you entering the contest too?

50:47.836 --> 50:49.087
Mind your own business!

50:49.713 --> 50:51.089
Don't fumble up there.

51:04.019 --> 51:08.565
<i>Don't give up on anything</i>

51:08.648 --> 51:10.734
Don't. Don't you dare do it.

51:12.277 --> 51:13.278
He's so good.

51:25.665 --> 51:29.753
<i>Sick and tired of my lousy life</i>

51:29.836 --> 51:33.590
-<i>I now set out to find you again</i>
-Don't listen, my baby.

51:33.673 --> 51:37.469
<i>I will run to you
And throw myself in your embrace</i>

51:37.552 --> 51:40.514
<i>You won't be able to ignore me</i>

51:41.223 --> 51:44.810
<i>Louder and louder
I will call out your name</i>

51:44.893 --> 51:49.940
<i>The name of whom I love</i>

51:55.403 --> 51:58.114
I'm Cho Nam-suk
of Gongjin Korean-Chinese Restaurant.

51:58.198 --> 52:00.116
I hope you enjoy my song.

52:13.255 --> 52:16.383
-<i>Don't criticize me</i>
-Oh, my.

52:16.466 --> 52:20.470
-Block your ears.
-<i>For being cruel</i>

52:21.179 --> 52:27.352
<i>I only chose to part ways briefly
For your sake</i>

52:27.435 --> 52:31.481
<i>I love you</i>

52:32.858 --> 52:33.859
Gosh, Nam-suk.

52:35.151 --> 52:37.737
Thank you! Please applaud--

52:38.864 --> 52:42.993
Can I get a do-over?
The key must've been set way off.

52:43.076 --> 52:44.870
I asked for B sharp!

52:44.953 --> 52:48.290
<i>Squid, shrimp, anchovy</i>

52:48.373 --> 52:51.334
<i>Webfoot octopus, baby octopus,
shark, and turtle</i>

52:51.418 --> 52:54.796
<i>You were born in the ocean</i>

52:54.880 --> 52:57.966
<i>What do you think about while you live?</i>

52:58.049 --> 53:01.469
<i>Good, good, good, good, let's laugh</i>

53:01.553 --> 53:03.722
<i>That's right, right, right, right</i>

53:03.805 --> 53:05.974
What were the lyrics?

53:06.057 --> 53:07.684
You wench!

53:07.767 --> 53:09.394
-I forgot…
-How could you?

53:09.477 --> 53:11.104
-It could happen, gosh!
-Seriously?

53:11.187 --> 53:13.857
Is that the best you can do, you idiot?

53:13.940 --> 53:15.817
How can you be so dumb?

53:15.901 --> 53:18.236
It's not like I wanted to forget.

53:18.320 --> 53:19.237
-Damn you!
-Hey!

53:19.321 --> 53:22.282
Cut the music!

53:40.550 --> 53:42.552
She's so adorable.

53:43.261 --> 53:46.139
Ms. Dentist, can you come
with me for a minute?

53:46.222 --> 53:47.515
Where?

53:47.599 --> 53:48.808
This is urgent. Come on.

53:48.892 --> 53:49.976
What now?

53:50.060 --> 53:51.144
Someone's hurt.

53:52.479 --> 53:53.855
Hurry.

53:55.899 --> 54:00.320
<i>You are my precious love</i>

54:01.780 --> 54:07.702
<i>You are</i>

54:08.411 --> 54:14.209
<i>My eternal love</i>

54:14.292 --> 54:17.545
<i>I love you</i>

54:17.629 --> 54:21.466
<i>I love you</i>

54:21.549 --> 54:25.845
<i>But why do tears</i>

54:28.556 --> 54:31.601
<i>Keep falling?</i>

54:48.618 --> 54:50.870
She sprained her ankle while dancing.
Take a look.

54:50.954 --> 54:53.373
I'm a dentist, not an orthopedist.

54:53.456 --> 54:55.667
You're still more qualified than I am.

54:55.750 --> 54:57.419
Ju-ri, which foot is it?

54:57.502 --> 54:59.129
What? The left.

55:06.469 --> 55:07.887
-It hurts.
-Does it?

55:07.971 --> 55:08.805
Yes.

55:10.515 --> 55:12.976
It's swollen too much.
You should go to the hospital.

55:13.059 --> 55:14.019
No way.

55:14.102 --> 55:16.813
She wants to perform.
She's willing to dance in this state.

55:16.896 --> 55:18.815
I doubt you can even walk.

55:18.898 --> 55:19.983
I have to win this.

55:20.066 --> 55:21.943
I need the prize money to get braces.

55:22.610 --> 55:23.945
-What?
-Seriously?

55:24.029 --> 55:26.031
I think your snaggletooth looks adorable.

55:26.114 --> 55:29.451
You're just like Dad. Stop saying that.
I absolutely loathe it!

55:29.534 --> 55:30.577
You what?

55:31.161 --> 55:33.204
You can get them when you're older.

55:33.288 --> 55:35.874
Now's not the time.
Let's go to the hospital.

55:35.957 --> 55:37.459
No, it has to be now.

55:37.542 --> 55:39.335
Why are you in such a rush?

55:39.836 --> 55:41.713
Is there a particular reason?

55:41.796 --> 55:43.923
There's this boy I like,

55:44.007 --> 55:45.925
but I can't smile in front of him.

55:46.009 --> 55:48.678
The snaggletooth shows first,
so I keep covering it up,

55:48.762 --> 55:50.221
and it kills my self-esteem.

55:50.305 --> 55:52.015
What if he falls for some other girl?

55:52.098 --> 55:54.100
It's why I need braces right now!

55:54.184 --> 55:55.727
-Please.
-The next contestant is

55:55.810 --> 55:57.979
a seventh grader
at Cheongjin Middle School,

55:58.063 --> 56:00.398
-Oh Ju-ri!
-Now? Are you kidding me?

56:02.609 --> 56:04.611
Did he just say Ju-ri?

56:04.694 --> 56:06.362
-Oh Ju-ri?
-Is she entering?

56:06.446 --> 56:07.906
-Goodness.
-Gosh.

56:10.492 --> 56:12.660
-Ju-ri?
-Is she…

56:12.744 --> 56:15.872
Why is she limping? Ju-ri, what's wrong?

56:17.040 --> 56:18.041
Ju-ri!

56:18.666 --> 56:21.336
-Ju-ri…
-Oh Ju-ri will begin her performance.

56:26.800 --> 56:29.969
<i>Tears drop as I turn the steering wheel</i>

56:30.053 --> 56:33.264
<i>I'm on my way to you</i>

56:33.348 --> 56:36.309
<i>I feel terrible
But there's so much traffic</i>

56:36.392 --> 56:37.894
<i>I…</i>

56:41.064 --> 56:44.275
Ju-ri, get down here. Come on!

56:46.528 --> 56:47.904
Just a second.

56:48.988 --> 56:50.573
We'll take it from the top.

56:52.325 --> 56:53.326
Hye-jin?

56:57.122 --> 56:57.956
Uncle?

56:58.581 --> 56:59.415
Hey.

56:59.499 --> 57:01.835
Let's place first. I hate second place.

57:04.546 --> 57:05.380
Ju-ri, sit.

57:06.548 --> 57:09.217
-Du-sik, what's wrong with Ju-ri?
-Goodness.

57:12.554 --> 57:13.721
What?

57:14.973 --> 57:17.225
Seriously? Chun-jae, get up.

57:17.725 --> 57:19.644
-Do you know this dance?
-I don't.

57:19.727 --> 57:21.020
Then leave the stage.

57:21.104 --> 57:23.189
I thought the embarrassment
could be shared.

57:23.273 --> 57:25.525
Besides, it's all about
making people excited

57:26.234 --> 57:27.735
on events like this.

57:27.819 --> 57:29.154
Ju-ri, you got this.

57:30.113 --> 57:33.241
<i>Tears drop as I turn the steering wheel</i>

57:33.324 --> 57:36.494
-<i>I'm on my way to you</i>
-What is she doing?

57:36.578 --> 57:39.205
<i>I feel terrible
But there's so much traffic</i>

57:39.289 --> 57:41.749
<i>I call but you don't pick up</i>

57:42.292 --> 57:45.628
<i>Beautiful northern lights</i>

57:46.129 --> 57:48.798
-Were they always a team?
-<i>I desperately call for you</i>

57:48.882 --> 57:49.924
-Who knows?
-<i>I hear you</i>

57:50.633 --> 57:54.304
-Is Dr. Yoon a good dancer or a bad one?
-<i>Our time together</i>

57:54.387 --> 57:58.975
She seems to be trying,
but it's kind of choppy.

58:02.937 --> 58:06.232
Who knew that Chief Hong
was bad at something?

58:06.316 --> 58:09.611
<i>Hurry up tonight</i>

58:09.694 --> 58:12.405
<i>Please come back, just a feeling</i>

58:16.576 --> 58:19.412
<i>I will be there for you</i>

58:19.496 --> 58:22.207
<i>Hurry up tonight</i>

58:22.290 --> 58:25.418
<i>Please come back, just a feeling</i>

58:29.714 --> 58:33.635
<i>Bewildered and mesmerized
I can't escape you</i>

58:33.718 --> 58:37.347
<i>Please, please, turn around</i>

58:47.190 --> 58:49.651
-My gosh.
-Ju-ri, it's Dad!

58:52.654 --> 58:57.492
That was great. Our Du-sik is good
at absolutely everything.

59:01.663 --> 59:04.415
So much for not getting involved.
She's in deep.

59:22.934 --> 59:23.768
Sit here.

59:24.978 --> 59:27.814
-Oh, no. My good reputation.
-<i>Hi, I'm Choi Bo-ra!</i>

59:27.897 --> 59:29.691
As if you had one.

59:29.774 --> 59:31.693
This is all your fault.

59:31.776 --> 59:34.946
One might think I made you go up there.

59:35.029 --> 59:36.614
That was your own choice.

59:36.698 --> 59:38.324
Must you always blame others?

59:38.408 --> 59:40.118
-You're so annoying!
-Likewise.

59:40.201 --> 59:43.830
Did you see the crowd earlier?
We might actually win!

59:43.913 --> 59:45.748
-Yes!
-My gosh!

59:45.832 --> 59:47.625
-I never lose, you know.
-First place.

59:47.709 --> 59:50.920
<i>I will tightly embrace</i>

59:51.004 --> 59:55.049
<i>My friend's broken heart</i>

59:55.133 --> 59:58.678
<i>Just like someone did</i>

59:58.761 --> 1:00:03.725
<i>When I was feeling down</i>

1:00:03.808 --> 1:00:06.477
<i>A friend's wrongdoing</i>

1:00:06.561 --> 1:00:09.814
<i>Will be embraced with warm forgiveness</i>

1:00:09.897 --> 1:00:14.402
-Honey. Is that really our daughter?
-<i>And one's mistake</i>

1:00:15.194 --> 1:00:17.447
-Tell me about it.
-<i>Will be understood…</i>

1:00:17.530 --> 1:00:19.324
Goodness.

1:00:19.407 --> 1:00:23.661
There was a true singer
in Gongjin all along.

1:00:23.745 --> 1:00:29.500
<i>What will I do
With hatred that involuntarily formed</i>

1:00:29.584 --> 1:00:35.757
<i>With love</i>

1:00:35.840 --> 1:00:40.762
<i>I will embrace those with love</i>

1:00:40.845 --> 1:00:44.641
<i>I will hug you tightly</i>

1:00:44.724 --> 1:00:49.771
<i>With the warmth in my heart</i>

1:00:49.854 --> 1:00:53.441
<i>Please hug others tightly</i>

1:00:53.524 --> 1:00:56.569
<i>With tender love</i>

1:00:56.653 --> 1:01:00.531
<i>To let happiness</i>

1:01:00.615 --> 1:01:05.411
<i>Bloom inside our hearts</i>

1:01:05.495 --> 1:01:09.374
<i>I will hug you tightly</i>

1:01:09.457 --> 1:01:11.626
<i>I will take my friend</i>

1:01:11.709 --> 1:01:17.215
<i>In a warm embrace</i>

1:01:17.298 --> 1:01:19.842
<i>I will take my friend</i>

1:01:19.926 --> 1:01:26.891
<i>In a warm embrace</i>

1:01:34.691 --> 1:01:35.858
You did great!

1:01:40.279 --> 1:01:42.699
<i>And the winner is…</i>

1:01:42.782 --> 1:01:45.827
-Choi Bo-ra!
-Yes!

1:01:46.953 --> 1:01:48.496
Bo-ra, that was amazing.

1:01:48.579 --> 1:01:51.999
How is it that you never sang for me
when you are this good?

1:01:52.083 --> 1:01:56.254
Bo-ra, how about we swap our prize money?

1:01:56.337 --> 1:01:57.755
Don't be ridiculous!

1:01:57.839 --> 1:01:59.841
Bo-ra, let me keep it safe for you.

1:02:00.633 --> 1:02:02.218
-You too.
-Fine.

1:02:03.094 --> 1:02:04.178
I-jun, how was I?

1:02:04.262 --> 1:02:06.097
Yes, you were great.

1:02:06.180 --> 1:02:08.808
Let's play the claw machine.
I have three million won!

1:02:08.891 --> 1:02:10.435
-Bo-ra!
-No, don't go.

1:02:10.518 --> 1:02:11.728
Take me with you then.

1:02:13.229 --> 1:02:15.523
I didn't know Bo-ra was that talented.

1:02:18.693 --> 1:02:20.278
Give me all the prize money.

1:02:20.361 --> 1:02:23.698
-What?
-What? We should split it three ways.

1:02:23.781 --> 1:02:25.158
-No, it's mine.
-No way.

1:02:25.241 --> 1:02:27.827
Are you seriously
trying to steal a kid's money?

1:02:27.910 --> 1:02:30.830
Ju-ri, it's fine by me, so take my share.

1:02:30.913 --> 1:02:32.123
-It's mine.
-No!

1:02:32.206 --> 1:02:33.583
-Seriously?
-Give it here!

1:02:33.666 --> 1:02:34.625
Come on.

1:02:35.209 --> 1:02:38.004
I'll take this and do your braces.

1:02:38.087 --> 1:02:39.338
-What?
-What?

1:02:39.422 --> 1:02:41.090
I'll do your braces.

1:02:42.550 --> 1:02:44.510
It's not for free though.

1:02:44.594 --> 1:02:45.887
This is the first payment.

1:02:46.429 --> 1:02:48.347
Pay the rest when you grow up.

1:02:50.892 --> 1:02:53.311
So grow up well
if you want to pay your debt.

1:02:53.394 --> 1:02:55.188
Hye-jin!

1:02:59.358 --> 1:03:02.361
Thank you all for waiting.
We'll now take some photos.

1:03:02.445 --> 1:03:03.821
-Here.
-Right.

1:03:03.905 --> 1:03:05.531
Here, hold this for the photo.

1:03:13.498 --> 1:03:15.500
-Cheese!
-Cheese!

1:03:19.670 --> 1:03:21.297
Watch your step.

1:03:21.380 --> 1:03:23.674
Are you seriously on your phone?

1:03:23.758 --> 1:03:25.760
DOS is going live.

1:03:25.843 --> 1:03:27.470
-It's almost time.
-Watch your step!

1:03:27.553 --> 1:03:28.679
Ju-ri!

1:03:29.597 --> 1:03:30.681
Juri, are you okay?

1:03:30.765 --> 1:03:32.809
Startled by her own dad.

1:03:32.892 --> 1:03:36.187
<i>Lastly, we have a special event.</i>

1:03:37.814 --> 1:03:39.565
Wait, those people…

1:03:42.735 --> 1:03:45.112
-Ju-ri…
-She won't talk to me.

1:03:45.655 --> 1:03:47.198
-Not even look at me.
-Two, three.

1:03:47.782 --> 1:03:48.741
-Hello.
-Hi.

1:03:48.825 --> 1:03:51.077
-The operating system…
-Of the K-pop industry.

1:03:51.160 --> 1:03:52.411
-We're DOS.
-We're DOS.

1:03:59.377 --> 1:04:00.503
No way.

1:04:01.671 --> 1:04:03.965
Ju-ri, it's DOS.

1:04:05.800 --> 1:04:11.806
<i>Tears drop as I turn the steering wheel
I'm on my way to you</i>

1:04:11.889 --> 1:04:15.142
<i>I feel terrible
But there's so much traffic…</i>

1:04:15.226 --> 1:04:18.437
By the way, who are those boys?

1:04:18.521 --> 1:04:22.108
Who knows? I don't recognize any of them.

1:04:23.442 --> 1:04:25.528
What were they called again?

1:04:25.611 --> 1:04:28.155
D! O! S! My gosh.

1:04:28.239 --> 1:04:29.615
Are they DOS?

1:04:29.699 --> 1:04:31.367
No wonder Ju-ri calls them her life.

1:04:35.371 --> 1:04:37.748
-Did you film me earlier?
-Of course not.

1:04:37.832 --> 1:04:41.752
<i>If that's what you want
I can bring you back</i>

1:04:42.378 --> 1:04:45.339
<i>Let's hope for a miracle</i>

1:04:45.423 --> 1:04:48.301
<i>Please come back, just a feeling</i>

1:04:52.138 --> 1:04:54.682
How can boys be that pretty?

1:04:54.765 --> 1:04:56.934
Seriously.
It's good for prenatal education.

1:04:57.018 --> 1:04:58.769
Are you seeing this, my baby?

1:04:58.853 --> 1:05:01.230
I'll send you the video I'm filming.

1:05:01.314 --> 1:05:03.357
-Thanks.
-Thanks for what?

1:05:03.441 --> 1:05:04.275
What?

1:05:11.407 --> 1:05:12.366
<i>Please come back</i>

1:05:18.039 --> 1:05:22.627
<i>Bewildered and mesmerized
I can't escape you</i>

1:05:22.710 --> 1:05:25.713
<i>Please, please, turn around</i>

1:05:25.796 --> 1:05:27.840
-DOS.
-You're the best!

1:05:27.924 --> 1:05:29.091
The best!

1:05:30.885 --> 1:05:33.095
Look how handsome they are!

1:05:33.179 --> 1:05:36.390
The ending was killer. My gosh.

1:05:38.768 --> 1:05:41.979
Where did she go?
Why isn't she picking up?

1:05:45.107 --> 1:05:46.067
It hurts.

1:05:47.818 --> 1:05:48.736
It stings.

1:05:55.534 --> 1:05:57.912
Someone said that being nosy is incurable.

1:05:58.579 --> 1:06:00.456
That it's annoying and uncomfortable.

1:06:00.539 --> 1:06:04.460
She also said that she didn't
want to be the subject of gossip.

1:06:05.586 --> 1:06:09.048
Is being inconsistent your motto?
Your words don't match your actions.

1:06:09.131 --> 1:06:10.132
I'm leaving.

1:06:11.092 --> 1:06:12.510
Maybe you like being on stage.

1:06:12.593 --> 1:06:14.679
I guess you have a flair for the dramatic.

1:06:14.762 --> 1:06:17.807
No wonder you danced on the pole
after having too much wine.

1:06:17.890 --> 1:06:20.017
Are you nuts? Shut it!

1:06:20.518 --> 1:06:23.229
You're actually
crossing the line right now.

1:06:24.271 --> 1:06:25.648
You're the one who crossed it.

1:06:25.731 --> 1:06:29.235
Exactly. And I'm telling you
to cross it comfortably like I do.

1:06:32.697 --> 1:06:35.741
Don't be childish
and draw imaginary lines.

1:06:35.825 --> 1:06:37.410
Let me borrow your eraser

1:06:37.493 --> 1:06:39.620
and copy your homework once in a while.

1:06:40.621 --> 1:06:41.706
Homework? Why would I?

1:06:42.957 --> 1:06:44.333
Chief Hong!

1:06:44.417 --> 1:06:45.251
Coming!

1:06:58.222 --> 1:07:00.099
Where on earth did she go?

1:07:05.187 --> 1:07:06.188
JUNE!

1:07:12.278 --> 1:07:14.864
JUNE, just a second!

1:07:20.161 --> 1:07:21.120
-Get on.
-What?

1:07:21.203 --> 1:07:22.663
-Hop on!
-All right.

1:07:23.581 --> 1:07:26.667
-Let's go.
-JUNE, wait!

1:07:27.168 --> 1:07:29.295
JUNE, just a second!

1:07:29.378 --> 1:07:31.672
-JUNE, wait!
-Wait!

1:07:31.756 --> 1:07:34.050
-JUNE, hold on!
-Just a second!

1:07:34.133 --> 1:07:36.969
-Wait!
-Wait!

1:07:37.053 --> 1:07:40.056
JUNE, just a second. Wait.

1:07:40.139 --> 1:07:43.267
-Wait!
-Don't go yet.

1:07:46.270 --> 1:07:47.271
JUNE.

1:07:47.772 --> 1:07:49.482
JUNE, just a second.

1:07:49.565 --> 1:07:51.358
I'm a member of Hacker.

1:07:51.442 --> 1:07:54.528
-I'm 14 and my name is Oh Ju-ri.
-Hang on.

1:07:55.071 --> 1:07:56.363
That snaggletooth.

1:07:57.073 --> 1:07:58.991
-I think I saw you somewhere.
-What?

1:07:59.075 --> 1:08:01.994
I went to three of your concerts,
but I doubt you spotted me.

1:08:02.078 --> 1:08:03.746
-Three times?
-Getting tickets was--

1:08:03.829 --> 1:08:06.999
-Right. At the cafe.
-The cafe?

1:08:07.083 --> 1:08:08.459
You called me a fake.

1:08:09.960 --> 1:08:12.171
Never have I gotten that from anyone.

1:08:15.424 --> 1:08:17.551
-I let it slide since you're cute.
-What?

1:08:19.386 --> 1:08:21.138
-I'll see you around.
-Sure.

1:08:21.222 --> 1:08:24.391
You'll see her around? Why? What for?

1:08:24.475 --> 1:08:26.227
JUNE, you're super handsome!

1:08:35.152 --> 1:08:36.779
Unbelievable.

1:08:42.910 --> 1:08:43.953
Are you okay?

1:08:44.036 --> 1:08:46.288
Yes, I'm good.

1:08:49.375 --> 1:08:51.460
Gosh, all right.

1:08:52.044 --> 1:08:53.129
Let me see.

1:08:53.712 --> 1:08:56.006
Look at that nasty bruise.

1:08:57.091 --> 1:09:00.219
This is what you get
for being such a tomboy.

1:09:00.719 --> 1:09:01.971
You should get acupuncture.

1:09:02.054 --> 1:09:03.472
Forget it.

1:09:06.058 --> 1:09:07.977
Get some for your back instead.

1:09:09.937 --> 1:09:12.064
Why carry me with a herniated disc?

1:09:13.566 --> 1:09:15.317
Just thank me if you're grateful.

1:09:17.653 --> 1:09:21.031
If it weren't for me,
you wouldn't have gotten to talk to DOS.

1:09:21.115 --> 1:09:23.325
That's not how you pronounce it.

1:09:23.409 --> 1:09:25.786
Who cares how I pronounce it?

1:09:26.370 --> 1:09:29.248
-Everyone cares.
-Something's weighing me down.

1:09:29.331 --> 1:09:31.792
-Can you check for me?
-What's this?

1:09:31.876 --> 1:09:34.086
What is it? I wonder what this is.

1:09:34.170 --> 1:09:36.797
Wait. What's with all this money?

1:09:37.673 --> 1:09:39.842
-What--
-It's what I got for today's gig.

1:09:39.925 --> 1:09:42.428
I'll use it to pay for your braces.

1:09:43.971 --> 1:09:44.805
Here.

1:09:45.931 --> 1:09:46.891
I'm not getting it.

1:09:48.100 --> 1:09:49.101
Why not?

1:09:51.061 --> 1:09:54.023
I don't want to anymore. There's no need.

1:09:54.106 --> 1:09:55.649
What? Why?

1:09:56.650 --> 1:09:58.694
JUNE only recognized me
because of my teeth.

1:09:58.777 --> 1:10:02.072
Plus, he said I was adorable. Adorable!

1:10:02.156 --> 1:10:04.200
Can you be any more annoying?

1:10:04.283 --> 1:10:05.743
What am I going to do with you?

1:10:05.826 --> 1:10:09.413
I called you cute too,
but you didn't care for what I said.

1:10:09.496 --> 1:10:10.748
That's different.

1:10:12.499 --> 1:10:15.502
That JUNE must have superpowers.

1:10:16.170 --> 1:10:18.214
Come on. You should get something to eat.

1:10:18.297 --> 1:10:19.798
Can you help me up?

1:10:19.882 --> 1:10:21.550
-Hey.
-Help.

1:10:22.092 --> 1:10:24.470
-Hop on.
-Maybe I should.

1:10:24.553 --> 1:10:25.596
All right.

1:10:25.679 --> 1:10:27.681
-My gosh!
-What now?

1:10:27.765 --> 1:10:30.976
I'm afraid I can't carry you twice a day.

1:10:31.060 --> 1:10:32.603
-Forget it.
-Here.

1:10:32.686 --> 1:10:35.189
Do we have patches left?
I'll stick a few on your back.

1:10:36.315 --> 1:10:37.733
Slow and steady though.

1:10:37.816 --> 1:10:40.402
Appreciate the scenery while we walk.

1:10:41.070 --> 1:10:42.363
You brat.

1:10:43.530 --> 1:10:44.990
-You know what?
-What?

1:10:45.532 --> 1:10:48.202
Like you, I tried everything

1:10:48.285 --> 1:10:50.162
to look good for your mom.

1:10:50.246 --> 1:10:51.247
Really?

1:10:51.830 --> 1:10:53.749
-I never told you this.
-What?

1:10:54.416 --> 1:10:55.501
I even pierced my ears.

1:10:55.584 --> 1:10:59.004
-Really? Let me see.
-It closed up ages ago.

1:10:59.088 --> 1:11:01.924
Your mom hated it,
so I took it out three days later.

1:11:02.007 --> 1:11:03.634
Can I pierce my ears too?

1:11:07.513 --> 1:11:10.307
JINSEONG EXPRESS

1:12:13.329 --> 1:12:14.997
It's still chilly at night.

1:12:17.499 --> 1:12:18.584
Let's go home.

1:12:37.478 --> 1:12:40.314
Dad, I thought you'd be in bed.

1:12:40.397 --> 1:12:43.567
I was just about to turn in.
Is something up?

1:12:44.234 --> 1:12:46.070
Do I need a reason to call?

1:12:46.695 --> 1:12:47.905
I just did.

1:12:47.988 --> 1:12:49.365
<i>I see.</i>

1:12:49.990 --> 1:12:52.951
The plant that you sent me…

1:12:53.786 --> 1:12:55.079
It's bloomed.

1:12:55.162 --> 1:12:56.497
-<i>Really?</i>
-Yes.

1:12:56.580 --> 1:13:00.167
<i>Wow. From what I hear,
it only blooms once every seven years.</i>

1:13:00.250 --> 1:13:01.960
Really?

1:13:02.044 --> 1:13:04.630
<i>Yes. It's said that
the greatest luck in life</i>

1:13:04.713 --> 1:13:07.132
<i>finds its way to the person who sees it.</i>

1:13:12.179 --> 1:13:14.181
<i>Are you still there?</i>

1:13:14.264 --> 1:13:17.559
Yes. I'll water it well
and take good care of it.

1:13:17.643 --> 1:13:18.685
<i>Good.</i>

1:13:18.769 --> 1:13:21.563
Not too often though. The roots will rot.

1:13:21.647 --> 1:13:23.565
<i>Got it. Good night then.</i>

1:13:23.649 --> 1:13:27.528
Wait. Call once in a while
even though nothing's up.

1:13:27.611 --> 1:13:28.445
<i>I will.</i>

1:13:34.368 --> 1:13:36.703
So it bloomed?

1:13:39.790 --> 1:13:40.916
What are you doing here?

1:13:43.293 --> 1:13:44.169
Out on a walk.

1:13:45.337 --> 1:13:47.798
What? Do I need permission to go on walks?

1:13:47.881 --> 1:13:48.757
Which way?

1:13:49.591 --> 1:13:50.592
This way.

1:13:51.176 --> 1:13:52.052
Bye.

1:13:55.848 --> 1:13:57.099
Why are you following me?

1:13:57.182 --> 1:14:00.436
Again with Princess Syndrome.
I was headed this way too.

1:14:01.353 --> 1:14:03.814
To be honest,
I came close to hating you again.

1:14:04.440 --> 1:14:05.899
-What?
-But

1:14:05.983 --> 1:14:08.569
what you did today was cool,
and I'm proud.

1:14:09.736 --> 1:14:12.656
This is the type of thing
you shouldn't do.

1:14:12.739 --> 1:14:14.491
People will get the wrong idea.

1:14:14.575 --> 1:14:15.909
It'll be the last time.

1:14:16.952 --> 1:14:19.413
I don't befriend just anyone, you know.

1:14:32.468 --> 1:14:33.760
Those must be fireworks!

1:14:34.303 --> 1:14:35.971
Well, they aren't gunshots.

1:14:37.723 --> 1:14:39.850
I guess someone got the romance going.

1:14:40.350 --> 1:14:41.727
It's unnecessarily pretty.

1:14:47.900 --> 1:14:49.234
-It really is pretty.
-Hey--

1:15:15.928 --> 1:15:17.346
I nearly died just now.

1:15:17.429 --> 1:15:19.515
-Death was right in my face.
-What?

1:15:22.392 --> 1:15:23.602
Seong-hyeon?

1:15:25.187 --> 1:15:28.148
I've been looking everywhere for you.
I finally found you.

1:15:38.534 --> 1:15:40.619
To the right! The right…

1:15:41.453 --> 1:15:43.497
Whatever. I didn't see that.

1:15:44.122 --> 1:15:44.957
Excuse me.

1:16:08.063 --> 1:16:09.523
It's been a while, Hye-jin.

1:16:32.963 --> 1:16:34.089
That will be 1,400 won.

1:16:39.344 --> 1:16:40.512
Just a second.

1:16:42.598 --> 1:16:43.599
Here's 100 won.

1:16:45.225 --> 1:16:47.311
-That's 1,400 won, right?
-What?

1:16:49.104 --> 1:16:50.105
You don't have to.

1:16:50.188 --> 1:16:51.356
Enjoy your milk.

1:16:52.024 --> 1:16:52.899
Wait!

1:17:07.831 --> 1:17:08.957
YOON HYE-JIN

1:17:23.639 --> 1:17:26.600
HONG DU-SIK

1:18:25.367 --> 1:18:27.828
Do you two know each other?

1:18:27.911 --> 1:18:29.162
<i>How long has it been?</i>

1:18:29.246 --> 1:18:31.289
<i>I'd like for you to explain something.</i>

1:18:31.373 --> 1:18:33.083
And not a word to him,

1:18:33.166 --> 1:18:35.252
especially about that night.

1:18:36.128 --> 1:18:37.003
What are you doing?

1:18:37.087 --> 1:18:41.258
<i>Caught between a rock and a hard place,
Chief Hong and Ji Seong-hyeon.</i>

1:18:41.842 --> 1:18:43.969
-Grandma, you know--
-Shut it.

1:18:44.052 --> 1:18:46.471
I'm not going to fall
for whatever you say.

1:18:46.555 --> 1:18:49.391
I won't film it unless it's that house.

1:18:49.474 --> 1:18:51.601
<i>There's something I want to know.</i>

1:18:51.685 --> 1:18:53.395
Is Hye-jin seeing anyone?

1:18:55.355 --> 1:19:00.360
