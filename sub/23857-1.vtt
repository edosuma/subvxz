<i>Beautiful items for sale!</i>

01:37.483 --> 01:40.552
<i>Anything written! Anything read!
Pashto and Dari!</i>

01:40.554 --> 01:43.388
- Beautiful items for sale!
- [chattering continues]

01:43.390 --> 01:46.191
[man] Anything written.
Anything read.

01:46.193 --> 01:49.530
Pashto and Dari. Beautiful
items for sale.

01:55.801 --> 01:59.537
I saw you serve a woman!
I saw you with my own eyes!

01:59.539 --> 02:01.239
- Uh, I really don't think...
- You were!

02:01.241 --> 02:02.739
Anything written.
Anything read.

02:02.741 --> 02:06.611
Pashto and Dari. Beautiful
items for sale.

02:06.613 --> 02:08.414
Parvana.

02:10.282 --> 02:12.483
It's the only thing
of value we have left.

02:12.485 --> 02:16.420
I never wore it.
Not even once.

02:16.422 --> 02:18.855
Where would you wear it,
Parvana?

02:18.857 --> 02:22.560
- Let's continue your studies. All right?
- Yes, Baba.

02:22.562 --> 02:27.699
Now, what can you tell me
about the Silk Road?

02:27.701 --> 02:29.436
The Silk Road.

02:30.670 --> 02:34.208
Baba, I can't remember
about the Silk Road.

02:35.007 --> 02:37.808
Maybe if we think of it
like a story.

02:37.810 --> 02:41.579
Stories remain in our hearts
even when all else is gone.

02:41.581 --> 02:45.415
Our people have always told
stories, from our very beginning,

02:45.417 --> 02:47.654
when we were Parthia
and Khorasan.

02:50.557 --> 02:54.324
[Baba] <i>A fractured land in the
claws of the Hindu Kush mountains,</i>

02:54.326 --> 02:58.528
<i>scorched by the fiery eyes
of the Northern Deserts,</i>

02:58.530 --> 03:01.566
<i>black rubble earth
against ice peaks.</i>

03:01.568 --> 03:05.606
<i>Our land was the petrified
skeleton of a monster.</i>

03:06.672 --> 03:08.338
<i>We were</i> Ariana,

03:08.340 --> 03:10.810
<i>the land of the noble
and honorable.</i>

03:12.312 --> 03:15.013
<i>We were a pathway
to everywhere,</i>

03:15.015 --> 03:17.684
<i>carrying goods
from east to west.</i>

03:18.885 --> 03:20.550
<i>We studied the stars</i>

03:20.552 --> 03:23.754
<i>and began to see order
amidst the chaos.</i>

03:23.756 --> 03:27.824
<i>We were scientists,
philosophers, and storytellers.</i>

03:27.826 --> 03:31.496
<i>Questions sought answers
and then more questions.</i>

03:31.498 --> 03:34.998
<i>We began to see our place
in the universe.</i>

03:35.000 --> 03:38.703
<i>But we were at the edges of
empires at war with each other,</i>

03:38.705 --> 03:41.538
<i>as borders were defined
and redefined...</i>

03:41.540 --> 03:44.510
- [shouting, horses whinnying]
- <i>over thousands of years.</i>

03:45.744 --> 03:49.616
<i>Of these mighty rulers
came Cyrus the Great of Persia.</i>

03:51.517 --> 03:54.420
<i>Then Alexander the Great
of Macedon.</i>

03:55.054 --> 03:57.754
<i>There came the Mauryan Empire,</i>

03:57.756 --> 03:59.691
<i>Genghis Khan,</i>

03:59.693 --> 04:02.060
<i>and so on and so on.</i>

04:02.062 --> 04:04.628
<i>Each time
there was bloodshed,</i>

04:04.630 --> 04:06.833
<i>and each time
there were survivors.</i>

04:07.933 --> 04:10.436
<i>A pattern repeating itself
endlessly.</i>

04:11.938 --> 04:14.004
[horse whinnies]

04:14.006 --> 04:15.772
<i>When I was young, Parvana,</i>

04:15.774 --> 04:19.777
<i>I knew what peace felt like,
here in this city.</i>

04:19.779 --> 04:23.948
<i>Children went to school,
women went to university.</i>

04:23.950 --> 04:26.751
<i>All the empires
forgot about us,</i>

04:26.753 --> 04:27.952
<i>for a while at least.</i>

04:27.954 --> 04:29.554
[explosion]

04:29.556 --> 04:31.556
- <i>But it did not last.</i>
- [men shouting]

04:31.558 --> 04:34.424
<i>The ground became weak
under our feet,</i>

04:34.426 --> 04:36.760
<i>always uncertain.</i>

04:36.762 --> 04:39.996
<i>First came a coup d'Ã©tat,
then an invasion,</i>

04:39.998 --> 04:41.701
<i>then a civil war.</i>

04:42.868 --> 04:44.434
<i>In the chaos,</i>

04:44.436 --> 04:47.573
<i>some looked to those
who might restore order.</i>

04:48.942 --> 04:50.607
<i>But at a great cost.</i>

04:50.609 --> 04:53.977
[man shouting] We have determined
specific dignity for women!

04:53.979 --> 04:58.082
Women should not go outside and
attract unnecessary attention!

04:58.084 --> 05:02.619
If a woman shows herself, she will
be cursed by the Islamic Sharia

05:02.621 --> 05:05.022
and should never expect
to go to heaven.

05:05.024 --> 05:07.592
Everything changes,
Parvana.

05:07.594 --> 05:09.697
Stories remind us of that.

05:13.632 --> 05:16.734
Parvana, were you
listening at all?

05:16.736 --> 05:18.001
Yes, Baba.

05:18.003 --> 05:21.873
Why don't you tell me
about our nomadic ancestors

05:21.875 --> 05:24.411
and their hills of gold?

05:25.145 --> 05:26.777
Well?

05:26.779 --> 05:28.548
2,000 years ago...

05:29.481 --> 05:32.618
- Yes?
- 2,000 years ago...

05:33.652 --> 05:36.753
[Parvana]
<i>there was a Bactrian princess</i>

05:36.755 --> 05:39.190
<i>who had a crown.</i>

05:39.192 --> 05:41.159
[Baba]
<i>And?</i>

05:41.161 --> 05:43.027
- [Parvana] <i>And...</i>
- <i>Parvana?</i>

05:43.029 --> 05:45.496
Away.
Keep away from my things.

05:45.498 --> 05:48.765
Go away. I said go
away, you silly dog!

05:48.767 --> 05:51.702
Hey, you! What do you
think you're doing?

05:51.704 --> 05:52.969
Why is this girl
shouting?

05:52.971 --> 05:55.205
She is only a child.
She meant nothing by it.

05:55.207 --> 05:56.974
She's drawing attention
to herself!

05:56.976 --> 05:59.544
She should be at home, not
displaying herself in the market.

05:59.546 --> 06:02.880
I have no son at home, except an infant.
I need my daughter to help me.

06:02.882 --> 06:04.549
- Stand up when we talk to you.
- I am a cr...

06:04.551 --> 06:05.853
I said stand up!

06:08.455 --> 06:09.990
[groans]

06:12.592 --> 06:14.724
- I know you.
- Yes, Idrees.

06:14.726 --> 06:16.960
I was your teacher once.
You were a good student.

06:16.962 --> 06:19.864
You wasted my time, teaching
me things of no worth.

06:19.866 --> 06:23.501
I have joined the Taliban and now
I fight the enemies of Islam.

06:23.503 --> 06:28.071
Well, if I am an enemy, then for
my sins God has taken my leg.

06:28.073 --> 06:29.941
Are you making fun of me,
old man?

06:29.943 --> 06:33.578
I lost my leg in the war.
The war we fought together.

06:33.580 --> 06:35.746
- How old is the girl?
- Idrees.

06:35.748 --> 06:37.715
- She is a child.
- She's old enough to marry.

06:37.717 --> 06:39.549
I'll be looking
for a wife soon.

06:39.551 --> 06:41.551
She's already been promised
to someone.

06:41.553 --> 06:43.253
Well, she should
cover herself properly.

06:43.255 --> 06:45.655
- Maybe you should stop looking at her.
- What did you say to me?

06:45.657 --> 06:47.825
I said
stop looking at her.

06:47.827 --> 06:49.693
- I can have you killed!
- Idrees.

06:49.695 --> 06:51.895
- You watch what you say!
- That's enough. Come on.

06:51.897 --> 06:54.599
[exhales]

06:54.601 --> 06:56.234
Are you all right?

06:56.236 --> 06:58.068
Yes, Baba.

06:58.070 --> 06:59.606
That's my girl.

07:00.106 --> 07:01.707
Let's go home now.

07:15.188 --> 07:17.188
[sighs]

07:17.190 --> 07:18.826
Parvana?

07:19.993 --> 07:23.094
You told that boy
I was promised to someone.

07:23.096 --> 07:24.929
Am I getting married?

07:24.931 --> 07:27.731
[chuckling] Of course not.
You are still a child.

07:27.733 --> 07:30.133
I want you playing
and telling stories.

07:30.135 --> 07:32.003
I'm too old for that now.

07:32.005 --> 07:35.106
Too old for stories?
You've always loved stories.

07:35.108 --> 07:37.044
What's the use?

07:49.022 --> 07:51.856
I'll have a word with Mama-jan
and we'll sort it all out.

07:51.858 --> 07:53.590
Please don't mention
the dress.

07:53.592 --> 07:57.830
[humming]

07:58.865 --> 08:01.765
Then I'll never
hear the end of it.

08:01.767 --> 08:04.101
- The end of what?
- Nothing, Mama-jan.

08:04.103 --> 08:06.736
[Baba] We're not selling
Parvana's good dress.

08:06.738 --> 08:09.239
Baba, that's not
what I meant.

08:09.241 --> 08:11.308
We need the money,
Baba.

08:11.310 --> 08:15.111
We'll hold off for a bit. I
think business will pick up.

08:15.113 --> 08:18.181
If business picks up, then we
won't have to sell it, sure.

08:18.183 --> 08:21.987
But the sky is far and the earth is hard.
We will have to sell it soon.

08:23.019 --> 08:24.054
Well, what about a little story
before dinner?

08:24.056 --> 08:27.657
And we'll forget all about
dresses for a while.

08:27.659 --> 08:30.227
Maybe Parvana would like
to read something for us?

08:30.229 --> 08:32.929
Not right now, Mama-jan.
I'm tired.

08:32.932 --> 08:35.799
[chuckles] She's not a child
anymore, she tells me.

08:35.802 --> 08:38.068
So she doesn't
like stories.

08:38.071 --> 08:41.671
Don't be in such a hurry
to grow up, my sweet girl.

08:41.673 --> 08:44.041
It might not be
all that you expect.

08:44.043 --> 08:47.311
We're out of water. You didn't
bring enough this morning.

08:47.313 --> 08:49.245
But there's half a bucket
by the door.

08:49.247 --> 08:53.350
When I was young enough to fetch
water, the buckets were never empty.

08:53.352 --> 08:55.219
- Hey!
- [mother] Girls, stop it.

08:55.221 --> 08:58.288
- Either you go out and get more water after dinner...
- [humming]

08:58.290 --> 09:00.791
or you can wash
Zaki's dirty diapers.

09:00.793 --> 09:03.326
- How are you feeling?
- Better.

09:03.328 --> 09:04.795
Now that you're here.

09:04.797 --> 09:09.934
Maybe if you didn't wash your hair so
much, we wouldn't run out so quickly.

09:09.936 --> 09:12.869
- Parvana.
- [Baba] You should have some respect.

09:12.871 --> 09:15.672
Why don't you eat,
hmm?

09:15.674 --> 09:19.913
- Things always look better when your belly is full.
- Yes, Maudar.

09:25.684 --> 09:28.721
[babbling]

09:30.856 --> 09:33.257
Zaki, Zaki, wait till I
pull up your sleeves.

09:33.259 --> 09:34.859
No, Mama-jan.

09:34.861 --> 09:37.862
- There. There you go.
- [babbling continues]

09:37.864 --> 09:41.998
Don't eat all the raisins, Parvana.
Leave them for Zaki.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.335
Why don't you give him that big
raisin on your chin, Soraya?

09:45.337 --> 09:47.705
Oh, but it's
not a raisin.

09:47.707 --> 09:49.809
It's a big,
hairy mole.

09:50.677 --> 09:53.212
Parvana,
apologize to Soraya.

09:57.015 --> 09:58.651
Parvana?

10:02.388 --> 10:04.754
[knocking on door]

10:04.756 --> 10:07.023
[Idrees]
He's in there! I saw him!

10:07.025 --> 10:08.792
- [man shouting] If there are women present...
- Baba?

10:08.794 --> 10:10.664
Cover yourselves now!

10:12.765 --> 10:14.998
That's the man.
An enemy of Islam.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.268
He's got forbidden books, and he's
teaching the women with them!

10:18.270 --> 10:20.171
- Leave us be!
- He's done nothing!

10:20.173 --> 10:25.075
- Nurullah Alizai, you must come with us.
- [all shouting]

10:25.077 --> 10:26.444
Baba!

10:26.446 --> 10:29.013
- You can't take him!
- Baba!

10:29.015 --> 10:31.147
- [screams, groans]
- Baba-jan!

10:31.149 --> 10:33.249
[Zaki crying]

10:33.251 --> 10:35.085
Where is he being taken?

10:35.087 --> 10:37.088
To prison.

10:37.090 --> 10:39.993
They'll teach him a good lesson
in Pul-e-Charkhi.

10:41.059 --> 10:43.094
- [sobbing]
- Baba!

10:43.096 --> 10:44.762
Baba!

10:44.764 --> 10:46.397
[engine starts]

10:46.399 --> 10:48.201
[gasps]

11:06.385 --> 11:10.354
Mama-jan?
Can I light the lamp?

11:10.356 --> 11:13.791
Hush, Parvana.
You'll wake Zaki.

11:13.793 --> 11:15.759
But if they
let Baba go,

11:15.761 --> 11:18.528
he'll need a light in
the window to see home.

11:18.530 --> 11:22.068
How could he come home? He doesn't
even have his stick to walk with.

11:24.504 --> 11:27.238
Go back to sleep.
It will be all right.

11:27.240 --> 11:30.240
How do you know that, Mama-jan?
How do you know?

11:30.242 --> 11:33.914
Be quiet, Parvana. She has
enough to worry about.

11:42.388 --> 11:45.321
[laughing, babbling]

11:45.323 --> 11:47.258
Hey!
Zaki, stop it.

11:47.260 --> 11:48.859
[squealing, laughing]

11:48.861 --> 11:50.860
Get up, Parvana.
Stop playing around.

11:50.862 --> 11:52.428
Why?
What's going on?

11:52.430 --> 11:54.098
You and I
are going to find Baba.

11:54.100 --> 11:58.002
The boy said he was being taken to Pul-e-Charkhi
prison, so that's where we are going.

11:58.004 --> 11:59.903
But we can't go outside
without Baba.

11:59.905 --> 12:02.006
Soraya is writing a letter
for the prison governor

12:02.008 --> 12:04.374
to protest Nurullah's arrest
and ask for his release.

12:04.376 --> 12:07.344
- At least I can give them that.
- Mama-jan, it's not allowed.

12:07.346 --> 12:10.547
We might be all right if we don't
draw attention to ourselves.

12:10.549 --> 12:12.349
- But we can't...
- Come on, Parvana.

12:12.351 --> 12:15.154
And bring Baba's walking stick.
We have to get going.

12:22.595 --> 12:24.029
[groans]

12:25.164 --> 12:26.899
Mama.

12:47.252 --> 12:49.118
Hey.

12:49.120 --> 12:51.057
Hey, you!

12:53.425 --> 12:56.226
Salaam. Can you tell me
the way to Pul-e-Charkhi?

12:56.228 --> 13:00.531
Salaam. Uh, it's east,
past the river.

13:00.533 --> 13:03.032
- But it's a long way.
- Thank you, sir.

13:03.034 --> 13:06.273
Listen. Go through the old
town, or you'll be caught.

13:20.919 --> 13:22.920
[truck stops]

13:22.922 --> 13:26.226
- [engine off]
- [door opens, closes]

13:27.360 --> 13:30.060
- Why are you out here by yourself?
- [stammering]

13:30.062 --> 13:31.995
- Where is your husband?
- I have no choice.

13:31.997 --> 13:34.931
It's not permitted to be out here
without your husband or your brother.

13:34.933 --> 13:36.966
- I'm sorry. I know.
- Do you understand?

13:36.968 --> 13:40.037
- I am bringing a letter protesting my husband's arrest...
- Just go home.

13:40.039 --> 13:41.537
- No!
- What do you mean, "no"?

13:41.539 --> 13:43.272
This is Nurullah Alizai,
my husband.

13:43.274 --> 13:45.975
- He was arrested last night with no charges laid against him.
- Photographs are forbidden!

13:45.977 --> 13:49.412
- I have no one at home...
- What are you doing, showing me a photograph?

13:49.414 --> 13:52.917
- Out here by yourself. Go home!
- There is no one in my house except for children.

13:52.919 --> 13:57.323
You have no business out here. Do you
understand? Go home. Immediately.

13:58.557 --> 14:00.427
You're looking
for trouble now!

14:09.501 --> 14:12.136
You are an insult to your
husband, to your race!

14:12.138 --> 14:14.271
I need to find out
what happened to him!

14:14.273 --> 14:17.944
- Shut up!
- [mother screaming, groaning]

14:19.645 --> 14:22.883
[man grunting]

14:32.324 --> 14:35.325
Going to the prison
will change nothing.

14:35.327 --> 14:38.128
- [groans]
- If you make trouble like this,

14:38.130 --> 14:41.998
your husband will be punished
severely for your insolence.

14:42.000 --> 14:45.938
And if I find you out here again
by yourself, I will arrest you.

14:46.639 --> 14:48.173
Now go.

14:49.976 --> 14:52.442
[truck door opens, closes]

14:52.444 --> 14:54.344
[truck engine starts]

14:54.346 --> 14:56.213
Mama-jan?

14:56.215 --> 14:58.184
[whispers]
Take me home.

14:59.552 --> 15:02.188
[groans]

15:30.348 --> 15:32.451
[sighs]

15:37.023 --> 15:38.291
[gasps]

16:04.616 --> 16:06.316
- More!
- Shh.

16:06.318 --> 16:09.118
Go get water, Parvana.
We have none left.

16:09.120 --> 16:11.491
- [Zaki fussing]
- Come on.

16:40.785 --> 16:43.088
[man]
Get out!

16:44.222 --> 16:46.425
What are you up to?

16:47.425 --> 16:49.428
Get out of here.
They'll see you!

16:50.328 --> 16:52.128
[man, faint]
Hey, stop!

16:52.130 --> 16:54.500
Stop when I tell you!

16:59.605 --> 17:01.408
Through here!

17:02.875 --> 17:05.142
Stop!

17:05.144 --> 17:06.742
Where did
that boy go?

17:06.743 --> 17:08.446
Did you see?
Did you see?

17:10.348 --> 17:12.316
- Hey, you! Girl!
- Hey!

17:12.318 --> 17:14.453
- Come on!
- Forget about her!

17:19.156 --> 17:21.825
Parvana, this is
only half a bucket.

17:21.827 --> 17:23.693
Couldn't you fill them up
all the way?

17:23.694 --> 17:27.364
- [babbling, fussing]
- Zaki, shh. Don't wake her.

17:27.366 --> 17:30.666
- Hush, Zaki.
- Mama-jan!

17:30.668 --> 17:32.603
- Shh.
- Sooth him, Parvana.

17:32.605 --> 17:34.270
[whining]
Mama-jan.

17:34.272 --> 17:35.806
- Tell him a story.
- [sighs]

17:35.808 --> 17:37.441
Mama...

17:37.443 --> 17:40.177
One time
in the distant past,

17:40.179 --> 17:43.779
there was a little village at the
foot of the Hindu Kush mountains.

17:43.781 --> 17:46.682
- I want Mama-jan.
- Shh. Listen.

17:46.684 --> 17:51.154
The villagers had just managed
to gather precious seeds.

17:51.156 --> 17:55.558
And so, there was dancing and
singing and laughing and eating.

17:55.560 --> 17:57.760
Everyone was happy.

17:57.762 --> 17:59.762
<i>Especially for one boy</i>

17:59.764 --> 18:03.799
<i>who danced and sang and laughed
and ate more than anyone else.</i>

18:03.801 --> 18:06.670
[chattering, laughing]

18:06.672 --> 18:09.174
[singing in Afghan language]

18:18.951 --> 18:23.586
<i>While the villagers were dancing and
singing and laughing and eating,</i>

18:23.588 --> 18:24.723
<i>monsters were coming.</i>

18:26.858 --> 18:29.728
- [thunderclap]
- [growling, roaring]

18:32.330 --> 18:35.501
<i>The monsters frightened the
donkeys and ate the trees.</i>

18:39.672 --> 18:42.739
<i>They stole the most precious
thing in the whole village...</i>

18:42.741 --> 18:44.373
[screaming, shouting]

18:44.375 --> 18:46.212
<i>the seeds
for next year's crop.</i>

18:49.682 --> 18:53.482
<i>Then they ran back to the Hindu Kush
mountains where their master lay...</i>

18:53.484 --> 18:57.354
<i>the dreadful Elephant King
with spikes for tusks.</i>

18:57.356 --> 19:00.723
- <i>Grrrroar!</i>
- [roaring]

19:00.725 --> 19:04.393
Grroar! Grroar!

19:04.395 --> 19:06.697
- [trilling]
- Grroar!

19:06.699 --> 19:08.565
[coughing]

19:08.567 --> 19:10.202
Mama-jan.

19:10.836 --> 19:13.640
[babbling]

19:17.643 --> 19:20.712
[Zaki singing]

19:33.959 --> 19:36.462
[babbling]

19:38.731 --> 19:43.336
Please eat, Mama-jan. You'll feel
better when your belly is full.

19:50.643 --> 19:52.278
[moans]

20:02.288 --> 20:05.288
There's hardly
any food left.

20:05.290 --> 20:07.492
I'll go
to the market.

20:12.364 --> 20:15.401
[chattering,
shouting]

20:18.636 --> 20:21.307
- Salaam.
- Salaam. Twelve oranges, please.

20:21.906 --> 20:23.509
100 afghani.

20:24.676 --> 20:26.245
Thank you.

20:28.579 --> 20:32.082
Salaam. How much
for six apples, please?

20:32.084 --> 20:34.483
Salaam, child.
I can't serve you.

20:34.485 --> 20:36.819
But, sir, can I please
have six apples?

20:36.821 --> 20:40.589
- Get your father to buy food for you.
- My father has been taken.

20:40.591 --> 20:42.794
I'm sorry.
Maybe come back later.

20:48.099 --> 20:50.403
[sizzling]

21:01.079 --> 21:03.548
[chattering]

21:06.518 --> 21:08.652
Literally stolen.
But you know...

21:08.654 --> 21:12.325
Salaam. Can I have
a kilo of rice, please?

21:13.892 --> 21:16.026
- Salaam.
- Hey, you!

21:16.028 --> 21:17.893
Girl!

21:17.895 --> 21:19.331
Hey, stop!

21:22.401 --> 21:23.870
Stop when I tell you!

21:27.071 --> 21:29.574
[gasps, groans]

21:32.110 --> 21:34.313
Go! Go home!

21:37.116 --> 21:38.648
[Parvana]
I dropped the bag.

21:38.650 --> 21:40.416
- Hush.
- I lost the money.

21:40.418 --> 21:42.619
- Keep your head back.
- I can get the water though.

21:42.621 --> 21:44.691
Don't worry
about that now.

21:45.590 --> 21:47.723
I saved you
a piece of naan.

21:47.725 --> 21:51.363
I'll heat it up for you so it's
nice and fresh. All right?

22:12.617 --> 22:15.619
- [Parvana] What are we going to do?
- I don't know.

22:15.621 --> 22:18.854
Maybe if I go out early,
before it's crowded.

22:18.856 --> 22:20.623
It won't work,
Parvana.

22:20.625 --> 22:24.161
Market sellers won't risk getting
in trouble for serving you.

22:24.163 --> 22:26.762
Mama-jan has cousins
in Mazar-e-Sharif.

22:26.764 --> 22:28.864
I could write to them
for help.

22:28.866 --> 22:33.437
But we've never even met them.
How do you know they will help?

22:33.439 --> 22:34.907
We need food now.

24:20.712 --> 24:22.645
These were
your brother's clothes.

24:22.647 --> 24:25.851
They will be big,
but we can take them up a bit.

24:27.251 --> 24:30.085
Do I look like
a boy?

24:30.087 --> 24:32.822
You look like
Sulayman.

24:32.824 --> 24:35.025
- So much like him.
- Mama-jan.

24:35.027 --> 24:37.626
He was such a good boy.

24:37.628 --> 24:40.896
Not much older
than you are now.

24:40.898 --> 24:42.000
Shh.

24:43.234 --> 24:45.235
It's all right,
Mama-jan.

24:45.237 --> 24:48.771
Parvana is going to the
market for food and water.

24:48.773 --> 24:51.776
It's the only way, Mama-Jan.
We have nothing left.

25:09.728 --> 25:12.094
[chattering
in Afghan language]

25:12.096 --> 25:15.332
But these juices are warm.
I don't want warm juice.

25:15.334 --> 25:18.004
[squawking, clucking]

25:26.979 --> 25:29.148
[flies buzzing]

25:41.827 --> 25:44.928
- [laughing]
- Yes, that's what I said, but you know...

25:44.930 --> 25:47.229
Salaam. Salaam!

25:47.231 --> 25:49.031
Excuse me. Salaam!

25:49.033 --> 25:51.768
Salaam! Salaam!
Come inside, boy!

25:51.770 --> 25:54.941
- I'm not going to deliver, am I?
- [both laughing]

25:57.108 --> 25:59.912
[shopkeeper] But you
know how it goes, right?

26:02.114 --> 26:04.180
Well, let's hear it.

26:04.182 --> 26:09.055
I need a kilo of rice, a half kilo of
lentils, and a small amount of raisins.

26:10.288 --> 26:11.921
A small amount?
[laughs]

26:11.923 --> 26:14.289
Should I go
by my imagination?

26:14.291 --> 26:15.991
- Yes.
- [man laughing]

26:15.993 --> 26:18.928
Not very bright, this one.
[laughs]

26:18.930 --> 26:23.266
Poor iron won't make a sharp sword.
[laughing]

26:23.268 --> 26:25.835
Look at him smiling!
[laughs]

26:25.837 --> 26:29.338
Little guy doesn't even know
when he's being made fun of.

26:29.340 --> 26:31.876
Thank you.
Thank you very, very much.

26:52.931 --> 26:55.030
You're spilling
the tea.

26:55.032 --> 26:56.702
Sorry, Uncle.

27:04.041 --> 27:06.276
Who are you? Why were
you staring at me?

27:06.278 --> 27:07.777
- What is your name?
- My name?

27:07.779 --> 27:10.145
- I know you from somewhere.
- No... I wasn't...

27:10.147 --> 27:13.248
- Wasn't what?
- [stammering] You don't know me.

27:13.250 --> 27:15.050
- I do know you.
- No!

27:15.052 --> 27:17.821
- I <i>do</i> know you! You're Parvana!
- I'm not!

27:17.823 --> 27:20.226
I am Shauzia! Remember?
From school?

27:21.727 --> 27:24.928
- Shauzia?
- I had long hair then, but so did you.

27:24.930 --> 27:27.130
- [man] Deliwar.
- Don't tell anyone.

27:27.132 --> 27:28.668
Here's your cap.

27:29.934 --> 27:31.735
You need to get
a boy's name

27:31.737 --> 27:34.304
so you don't hesitate
next time somebody asks you.

27:34.306 --> 27:36.171
I am Deliwar now.

27:36.173 --> 27:37.806
It means "brave."

27:37.808 --> 27:40.175
- [man] Where are you?
- I-I have to run.

27:40.177 --> 27:42.280
It was good to see you.

27:44.014 --> 27:45.818
Deliwar.

27:46.518 --> 27:48.485
[Soraya]
Mama-jan, please sit down.

27:48.487 --> 27:53.056
- It will be curfew soon. What if she's not back by then?
- She's fine. I'm...

27:53.058 --> 27:54.390
Who's hungry?

27:54.392 --> 27:56.960
[sighs]
Parvana.

27:56.962 --> 27:59.194
Praise Allah. He has
returned you to me.

27:59.196 --> 28:02.766
[chuckling] Mama-jan,
you're squashing the naan.

28:02.768 --> 28:04.837
It smells delicious,
Parvana.

28:10.107 --> 28:12.142
[Parvana chuckles]

28:12.144 --> 28:13.846
Zaki.

28:18.250 --> 28:20.185
It's me. See?

28:22.020 --> 28:24.856
I bought them
especially for you.

28:27.858 --> 28:30.826
- [chuckles]
- Parvana?

28:30.828 --> 28:32.929
If you run out
and get some water,

28:32.931 --> 28:35.131
he'll get used to you
by the time you come back.

28:35.133 --> 28:37.299
- But I'm tired.
- Hurry on, Parvana.

28:37.301 --> 28:39.001
It's almost curfew.

28:39.003 --> 28:42.875
[shouting, chattering]

29:06.865 --> 29:09.101
You look
so much like him.

29:09.968 --> 29:11.500
Go change
Sulayman's clothes,

29:11.502 --> 29:13.303
or you'll
get them dirty.

29:13.305 --> 29:15.106
They are already
dirty.

29:23.013 --> 29:25.280
[babbling]
Elephant.

29:25.282 --> 29:27.150
- What?
- [babbling]

29:27.152 --> 29:30.452
He wants you to continue your
story about the elephant.

29:30.454 --> 29:32.454
[babbling]
Elephant.

29:32.456 --> 29:34.193
Well, um...

29:35.193 --> 29:36.425
in the village,

29:36.427 --> 29:38.862
under the
Hindu Kush mountains,

29:38.864 --> 29:41.400
the poor villagers
cried bitter tears.

29:42.334 --> 29:43.767
[villagers sobbing]

29:43.769 --> 29:48.203
<i>They did not know what they would do
without their precious bag of seeds.</i>

29:48.205 --> 29:50.973
<i>They would have nothing
to sow come next spring</i>

29:50.975 --> 29:53.242
<i>and nothing to eat
come next winter.</i>

29:53.244 --> 29:57.079
<i>But the boy,
he did not cry bitter tears.</i>

29:57.081 --> 29:59.281
<i>He looked toward the mountain
and he shouted...</i>

29:59.283 --> 30:01.550
I am not afraid of you,

30:01.552 --> 30:05.255
big, spiky,
bad Elephant King!

30:05.257 --> 30:08.427
- [thunderclap]
- [elephant roaring]

30:11.296 --> 30:14.998
<i>Well, maybe he was
a little bit afraid.</i>

30:15.000 --> 30:18.567
<i>He told the villagers who had
been weeping bitter tears</i>

30:18.569 --> 30:22.104
<i>that he would get the bag
of seed back before spring.</i>

30:22.106 --> 30:24.973
I will get the bag of
seed back before spring.

30:24.975 --> 30:27.477
- <i>But they laughed.</i>
- [all laughing]

30:27.479 --> 30:31.614
<i>They laughed and laughed, because he
was a child and not a great warrior.</i>

30:31.616 --> 30:34.383
<i>Yet the boy
repeated his promise.</i>

30:34.385 --> 30:38.387
I said, I will get the bag
of seed back before spring.

30:38.389 --> 30:40.155
<i>And he left the village</i>

30:40.157 --> 30:42.525
<i>to the sound of the Elephant
King's roars ahead of him.</i>

30:42.527 --> 30:44.460
[thunderclap]

30:44.462 --> 30:46.331
<i>Roar!</i>

30:48.933 --> 30:51.403
[squealing]

30:53.404 --> 30:56.040
[laughing]

30:58.943 --> 31:01.009
[mother laughing]

31:01.011 --> 31:07.019
[loudspeaker:
man chanting prayer]

31:16.493 --> 31:19.027
Mama-jan,
now that I am a boy

31:19.029 --> 31:22.030
we can go to the
prison and find Baba.

31:22.032 --> 31:24.566
No, Parvana,
we can't do that.

31:24.568 --> 31:26.068
- Why not?
- Shh.

31:26.070 --> 31:28.537
It's not that simple,
Parvana.

31:28.539 --> 31:30.405
But we have to try.

31:30.407 --> 31:33.008
- There's nothing we can do.
- That's not true.

31:33.010 --> 31:35.481
Stop it, Parvana.
You're upsetting her.

31:45.690 --> 31:48.524
[Idrees] Hey! Hey! I told you to stop!
Why do you keep running?

31:48.526 --> 31:50.593
You should have stopped
when you were told to.

31:50.595 --> 31:54.197
Where's your burqa? Why are you
dressed like this outside your house?

31:54.199 --> 31:57.700
[crying] My husband took my burqa.
I needed to buy medicine.

31:57.702 --> 31:59.469
[whispering]
Stop it. Stop it.

31:59.471 --> 32:02.572
He should be punished for
letting you outside like this!

32:02.574 --> 32:05.274
- Please, please! Please!
- You have to take his punishment!

32:05.276 --> 32:08.113
- [woman screaming]
- [blows landing]

32:09.547 --> 32:12.217
Stay inside
where you belong!

32:22.027 --> 32:24.997
[tweeting]

32:29.733 --> 32:32.471
Deliwar. Deliwar!

32:34.772 --> 32:36.806
Well? Have you remembered
your name yet?

32:36.808 --> 32:39.608
I don't think
I can go on like this.

32:39.610 --> 32:41.546
Too bad.
I could use some help.

32:46.584 --> 32:49.652
- I saw something.
- What do you want me to say?

32:49.654 --> 32:51.153
I should have helped.

32:51.155 --> 32:54.690
- You'd have helped yourself to a good whipping, that's all.
- But I'm not a boy.

32:54.692 --> 32:56.625
You're not a boy,
you're not a girl.

32:56.627 --> 33:00.430
I need a helper because this tray
is too heavy. Will you help?

33:00.432 --> 33:04.600
Scratch my nose. Quickly. If I let go
of the tray, the strap will break.

33:04.602 --> 33:06.169
[sighs]
That's better.

33:06.171 --> 33:07.737
- Aatish.
- What?

33:07.739 --> 33:10.506
I remembered my name.
It's Aatish.

33:10.508 --> 33:12.842
- That's not really a name.
- It means "fire."

33:12.844 --> 33:16.578
I know what it means,
but it's still not a name.

33:16.580 --> 33:18.681
Then it suits me fine.

33:18.683 --> 33:20.285
I'll call you
Aatish then.

33:21.418 --> 33:24.487
When you're a boy you can
go anywhere you like,

33:24.489 --> 33:26.290
Aatish Khan.

33:34.699 --> 33:36.431
Where are we going?

33:36.433 --> 33:38.170
You'll see.

33:53.718 --> 33:55.750
What if someone
sees us?

33:55.752 --> 33:58.220
I usually just pretend
I work here.

33:58.222 --> 34:00.459
If you look like you believe
it, then they will too.

34:01.725 --> 34:03.628
See? We're cleaners.

34:35.893 --> 34:37.860
What are you
waiting for?

34:37.862 --> 34:40.262
It's either ours,
or the mice eat it.

34:40.264 --> 34:42.664
I need to find a way
to see my Baba.

34:42.666 --> 34:45.467
You can have mine if you like.
I don't want him.

34:45.469 --> 34:49.304
My father was taken to prison and
we've heard nothing of him since.

34:49.306 --> 34:51.873
- They won't let you see him, Parvana.
- But I'm a boy now.

34:51.876 --> 34:55.610
Doesn't make a difference. They'll keep him or
let him go, but there's nothing you can do.

34:55.612 --> 34:57.813
You don't know that.

34:57.815 --> 35:01.286
I'm sorry.
It's just the way it is.

35:03.721 --> 35:08.557
There might be a way, but
you'll need lots of money.

35:08.559 --> 35:10.492
What for?

35:10.494 --> 35:13.699
You can get a lot done
with bribes. A lot.

35:18.302 --> 35:20.672
[Parvana] Anything written.
Anything read.

35:22.273 --> 35:24.273
Pashto and Dari.

35:24.275 --> 35:26.278
Wonderful items
for sale.

35:27.277 --> 35:29.778
Anything written!
Anything read!

35:29.780 --> 35:32.280
Anything written!
Anything read!

35:32.282 --> 35:34.520
What happened to the man
who used to sit here?

35:35.820 --> 35:37.887
It is a simple question.

35:37.889 --> 35:39.722
Don't you know?

35:39.724 --> 35:42.657
How should I know? Answer the question.
Where is he?

35:42.659 --> 35:45.827
- He left for Mazar-e-Sharif.
- And what are you to him?

35:45.829 --> 35:50.335
I'm his nephew,
uh... Aatish.

35:52.369 --> 35:54.269
Do you know
how to read?

35:54.271 --> 35:58.309
- Do you have something to read? I read Pashto and Dari.
- Read this.

36:01.545 --> 36:03.581
Let's see
if you're any good.

36:05.650 --> 36:07.586
[sighs]

36:10.288 --> 36:12.657
Come on. Take it out
of the envelope.

36:14.992 --> 36:16.592
"Dear Razaq..."

36:16.594 --> 36:19.595
Louder, or I will have to
take my business elsewhere.

36:19.597 --> 36:22.999
"Dear Razaq, I hope this
letter reaches you in Kabul.

36:23.001 --> 36:26.001
I'm writing to you
with sad news.

36:26.003 --> 36:31.242
I am sorry to tell you that Hala Begum
died on the way to her sister's wedding.

36:32.476 --> 36:35.911
The bus she was traveling on
hit a land mine.

36:35.913 --> 36:38.347
Her injuries
were too great to bear

36:38.349 --> 36:40.715
and she died
some hours afterward.

36:40.717 --> 36:43.351
I know this must be
a great shock to you,

36:43.353 --> 36:45.688
but please know that when
I last spoke to Hala,

36:45.690 --> 36:48.393
she told me of your
kindness toward her.

36:49.893 --> 36:51.994
May Allah bless you now,

36:51.996 --> 36:54.633
guide your path,
and give you courage."

36:57.969 --> 36:59.737
I'm sorry.

37:05.777 --> 37:08.280
[sighs]

37:32.369 --> 37:35.371
[mother] Ah, there's
my sweet little girl

37:35.373 --> 37:37.072
underneath
all the dust of Kabul.

37:37.074 --> 37:38.807
[Zaki fussing]

37:38.809 --> 37:41.409
[Soraya] Parvana,
what did you give Zaki?

37:41.411 --> 37:43.679
- It's a piece of candy.
- A piece?

37:43.681 --> 37:45.880
Oh!

37:45.882 --> 37:48.351
It's big enough
to choke him!

37:48.353 --> 37:51.086
Let him be, Soraya.
You're spoiling his fun.

37:51.088 --> 37:52.787
[fussing continues]

37:52.789 --> 37:54.090
Ow!

37:54.092 --> 37:56.992
[mother] Continue
the story, Parvana.

37:56.994 --> 37:59.128
- For Zaki.
- [Zaki exclaims]

37:59.130 --> 38:01.563
[Parvana]
There was this young boy,

38:01.565 --> 38:06.135
and he promised his people
to find the precious seeds.

38:06.137 --> 38:08.371
Elephant?
Elephant?

38:08.373 --> 38:11.474
Yes,
and the elephant.

38:11.476 --> 38:14.744
At night, the boy walked
through the pine trees

38:14.746 --> 38:17.782
on his way to the mountain
to face the Elephant King.

38:24.722 --> 38:27.590
<i>Something was following him
in the darkness,</i>

38:27.592 --> 38:30.595
<i>but he was too terrified
to turn around and face it.</i>

38:31.963 --> 38:33.595
<i>He began to run,</i>

38:33.597 --> 38:35.800
<i>and the thing
that chased him also ran.</i>

38:38.536 --> 38:41.740
<i>The boy ran faster
and so did his pursuer.</i>

38:42.940 --> 38:44.572
<i>He ran into the night,</i>

38:44.574 --> 38:48.413
<i>chased by the unknown demons
until he could run no more.</i>

38:49.012 --> 38:50.880
<i>He tumbled down a hill.</i>

38:50.882 --> 38:52.818
- [screaming]
- <i>Down.</i>

38:53.951 --> 38:56.018
<i>Down.</i>

38:56.020 --> 38:57.621
<i>Down.</i>

39:02.192 --> 39:03.928
[sighs]

39:12.170 --> 39:17.072
[mother] <i>Dear Cousin, it has been
many years since we have spoken,</i>

39:17.074 --> 39:21.976
<i>but I am writing to you now to tell
you that my husband has been arrested</i>

39:21.978 --> 39:25.951
<i>and we have no word on when
he will be released, if at all.</i>

39:27.784 --> 39:31.556
<i>My family is in a desperate
situation and I need your help.</i>

39:32.523 --> 39:34.490
<i>My eldest daughter
is now of age,</i>

39:34.492 --> 39:39.431
<i>and I am asking that you consider her as
a bride for your youngest son, Ajmal.</i>

39:40.530 --> 39:43.599
<i>Please take us out of Kabul</i>

39:43.601 --> 39:46.802
<i>so that we may have
a chance of survival.</i>

39:46.804 --> 39:49.204
<i>We will not be
a burden to you.</i>

39:49.206 --> 39:51.106
<i>We are skilled and strong</i>

39:51.108 --> 39:53.876
<i>and need little
by the way of means.</i>

39:53.878 --> 39:57.816
<i>May the blessings of Allah
be upon you. Fattema.</i>

40:01.184 --> 40:04.186
Anything written!
Anything read!

40:04.188 --> 40:07.056
Anything written!
Anything read!

40:07.058 --> 40:08.490
Anything written!

40:08.492 --> 40:10.659
How much
for the dress?

40:10.661 --> 40:12.094
Salaam. It's handmade.

40:12.096 --> 40:14.262
- How much?
- 3,000.

40:14.264 --> 40:16.932
Don't be stupid.
I'll give you 300.

40:16.934 --> 40:18.566
2,000.

40:18.568 --> 40:20.503
Handmade
in Mazar-e-Sharif.

40:20.505 --> 40:24.509
Your daughter will be very happy
to wear such a beautiful dress.

40:26.510 --> 40:28.612
She is my wife.

40:29.246 --> 40:30.979
1,500.

40:30.981 --> 40:32.717
See how it sparkles?

40:34.085 --> 40:36.588
Here's 1,000.

40:44.896 --> 40:47.729
- How much did you make?
- A thousand.

40:47.731 --> 40:50.298
That might be enough
for a good bribe.

40:50.300 --> 40:52.534
- Really?
- Definitely.

40:52.536 --> 40:56.271
I'm saving up too. Whatever money I
can hide from my father, I keep.

40:56.273 --> 40:59.478
And it's mounting up
to a nice little sum.

41:00.076 --> 41:01.876
See?

41:01.878 --> 41:04.646
I'm not going to stay
here forever, you know.

41:04.648 --> 41:07.615
- Have you ever been to the sea?
- No.

41:07.617 --> 41:08.816
Neither have I.

41:08.818 --> 41:13.222
But I've heard that the moon
pulls the water onto the shore

41:13.224 --> 41:15.157
and then
back out again.

41:15.159 --> 41:16.724
I want to see that.

41:16.726 --> 41:21.697
I want to put my feet on the warm sand and
have them cooled by the lapping water.

41:21.699 --> 41:26.034
What about your father?
Doesn't he depend on you?

41:26.036 --> 41:27.638
I am a good son.

41:28.639 --> 41:30.642
But he is not
a good father.

41:32.777 --> 41:35.144
- What will you do by the sea?
- [chuckles]

41:35.146 --> 41:40.182
I'd buy things and sell things,
like I do here, but for myself.

41:40.184 --> 41:44.286
There are people who go to the
edge of the water to do nothing.

41:44.288 --> 41:47.690
They just sit there and they look
at the sea with their sunglasses on

41:47.692 --> 41:49.791
or swim about
on floating tubes.

41:49.793 --> 41:52.760
So I could sell them
those things.

41:52.762 --> 41:55.764
Hmm. That sounds nice, Deliwar.

41:55.766 --> 41:57.932
And maybe
I'll join you.

41:57.934 --> 42:00.105
- Where are you going?
- Wish me luck.

42:07.712 --> 42:11.280
- Why are you back so early?
- I have brought some bread and raisins for Zaki.

42:11.282 --> 42:13.081
What are you doing,
Parvana?

42:13.083 --> 42:14.682
I'm going to find Baba.

42:14.684 --> 42:16.351
- No, you're not.
- I'm going.

42:16.353 --> 42:18.387
You won't make it home
before curfew.

42:18.389 --> 42:20.755
I'm going. There's nothing
you can do to stop me.

42:20.757 --> 42:24.193
Mama-jan has been through enough
without you doing something so stupid.

42:24.195 --> 42:26.295
- I have to find him.
- Parvana!

42:26.297 --> 42:28.032
Parvana!

42:29.099 --> 42:30.168
Parvana!

43:29.759 --> 43:32.830
[men shouting]

43:33.963 --> 43:35.364
Excuse me.

43:35.366 --> 43:37.865
Salaam. Hello!

43:37.867 --> 43:39.835
- [banging on door]
- Excuse me!

43:39.837 --> 43:42.170
- What do you want?
- [gasps]

43:42.172 --> 43:44.972
- I said, what do you want?
- I want to see my father.

43:44.974 --> 43:47.909
- Who?
- My father, Nurullah Alizai.

43:47.911 --> 43:49.845
Brought here two weeks ago
without charge.

43:49.847 --> 43:52.780
- Get out of here.
- I have money... 1,000 afghani.

43:52.782 --> 43:55.784
- I can give it to you if you promise to help.
- Hey, what are you doing?

43:55.786 --> 43:58.420
Nothing.
Just getting rid of a kid.

43:58.422 --> 44:00.489
Please! Open up!

44:00.491 --> 44:03.324
I have to see my father!
I have to see him!

44:03.326 --> 44:05.827
[screams, groans]

44:05.829 --> 44:08.699
Now get out of here
unless you want some more.

44:09.266 --> 44:11.266
[door slams]

44:11.268 --> 44:12.804
[lock sets]

44:14.105 --> 44:16.808
[groaning]

44:38.295 --> 44:41.231
[humming]

44:47.938 --> 44:52.744
They say it doesn't always
rain the way it thunders.

44:54.844 --> 44:59.447
Last we heard of him,
the boy had fallen down.

44:59.449 --> 45:04.853
He had fallen down the hill
and into the deepest of sleeps.

45:04.855 --> 45:08.157
But all was not lost.

45:08.159 --> 45:12.260
He was discovered
by an old woman.

45:12.262 --> 45:13.864
She had a drum.

45:15.398 --> 45:20.235
[Fattema] <i>A magic drum
that beat so beautifully</i>

45:20.237 --> 45:22.470
<i>that his heart woke up.</i>

45:22.472 --> 45:26.311
[drum beating]

45:30.480 --> 45:33.048
[gasps]

45:33.050 --> 45:37.318
<i>She knew he must be on a
quest, and so she asked him...</i>

45:37.320 --> 45:39.854
What is it you seek?

45:39.856 --> 45:43.425
Well, you see, the dreadful Elephant
King sent his jaguars to steal the...

45:43.427 --> 45:45.894
[cackling]

45:45.896 --> 45:49.298
No one has ever overcome
the Elephant King.

45:49.300 --> 45:52.904
- I know.
- Well, what makes you think you can?

45:53.436 --> 45:54.903
I need to.

45:54.905 --> 45:56.505
I just need to,
that's all.

45:56.507 --> 45:59.407
That's not
a very good answer.

45:59.409 --> 46:03.981
[Fattema] <i>Nevertheless, the woman told
him he'd need to find three things...</i>

46:05.583 --> 46:08.249
<i>something that shines,</i>

46:08.251 --> 46:10.586
<i>something that ensnares,</i>

46:10.588 --> 46:12.920
<i>and something that soothes.</i>

46:12.922 --> 46:17.025
<i>Only then would he overcome
the Elephant King.</i>

46:17.027 --> 46:18.927
Give them to me,
please!

46:18.929 --> 46:20.929
[chuckles]
I don't have them,

46:20.931 --> 46:22.898
so you'd better
go look for them.

46:22.900 --> 46:28.470
And hurry! If the seeds are not planted
soon, there will be no harvest.

46:28.472 --> 46:29.972
Yes, I know.

46:29.974 --> 46:32.340
[Fattema]
<i>She told him to head east.</i>

46:32.342 --> 46:35.279
East is the other way.

46:36.413 --> 46:39.615
[Fattema] <i>Still something
followed the boy,</i>

46:39.617 --> 46:43.021
<i>and still
he could not face it.</i>

47:02.639 --> 47:06.041
- He didn't take the money?
- I don't think bribes work on them.

47:06.043 --> 47:09.644
[sighs] No, no.
It probably wasn't enough.

47:09.646 --> 47:11.579
It might have
insulted him.

47:11.581 --> 47:15.117
You'll just have to save up more
and be even smarter next time.

47:15.119 --> 47:18.552
- Aaah!
- <i>I</i> have to be smarter?

47:18.554 --> 47:22.257
I've heard there is a guy who
pays well for small jobs.

47:22.259 --> 47:24.258
Come on.

47:24.260 --> 47:26.561
[Shauzia]
Sir, we have come to work.

47:26.563 --> 47:29.697
- And you are?
- I'm Deliwar. And this is Aatish.

47:29.699 --> 47:31.499
We are brothers.

47:31.501 --> 47:33.936
What kind of a name
is Aatish?

47:33.938 --> 47:35.570
[Shauzia] I don't know.
Ask our father.

47:35.572 --> 47:39.277
- Where is your father?
- He was martyred by the Russians.

47:40.143 --> 47:42.077
We can do
any job you want.

47:42.079 --> 47:43.448
For the right price.

47:45.715 --> 47:47.351
[grunts]

47:55.692 --> 47:57.992
[exhales] That's the
last one, I think.

47:57.994 --> 47:59.695
Where are we anyway?

47:59.697 --> 48:02.664
About time. You boys
are not very strong.

48:02.666 --> 48:04.599
It was more work
than you said.

48:04.601 --> 48:06.668
Here you are.
Now be off.

48:06.670 --> 48:09.204
Hey, we did all
that you asked.

48:09.206 --> 48:12.039
Wait! You said
you'd drive us back.

48:12.041 --> 48:14.175
I'm not a taxi.
Make your own way home.

48:14.177 --> 48:17.679
I'm late already because you
took so long to load the truck.

48:17.681 --> 48:19.449
Wait!

48:37.134 --> 48:39.200
I need to rest
a moment.

48:39.202 --> 48:42.206
Stay on the path.
This place might be mined.

49:04.427 --> 49:07.429
This is not nearly enough.
We need better jobs.

49:07.431 --> 49:10.532
- Like what?
- I heard brick making pays well.

49:10.534 --> 49:12.470
But it's hard work.

49:14.204 --> 49:16.371
I wish I was stronger.

49:16.373 --> 49:18.572
But you have an older
brother, don't you?

49:18.574 --> 49:21.143
He used to bring you to
school on his shoulders.

49:21.145 --> 49:24.045
What's his name?

49:24.047 --> 49:25.482
Sulayman.

49:27.650 --> 49:30.052
He died.

49:30.054 --> 49:32.554
How?
Was it the sickness?

49:32.556 --> 49:35.222
- I don't know.
- But your mother must have told you.

49:35.224 --> 49:37.395
She doesn't speak of it.
All right?

49:39.762 --> 49:41.398
All right.

49:44.567 --> 49:47.536
Hey, look
what I've got.

49:47.538 --> 49:51.539
I found it in a little box where
my father keeps his things.

49:51.541 --> 49:54.775
Can you believe
the water is that blue?

49:54.777 --> 49:56.580
It's very nice.

50:04.521 --> 50:07.421
[Parvana] Anything written!
Anything read!

50:07.423 --> 50:10.691
Anything written!
Anything read!

50:10.693 --> 50:13.364
Anything written!
Anything read!

50:14.331 --> 50:16.331
I didn't pay you
last time.

50:16.333 --> 50:19.166
- How much do I owe you?
- It's okay. I...

50:19.168 --> 50:21.405
What, you don't charge
for bad news?

50:24.574 --> 50:26.541
[groans]

50:26.543 --> 50:29.144
Who taught you to read?
The crippled teacher?

50:29.146 --> 50:30.878
Yes. My uncle.

50:30.880 --> 50:33.347
Can you write
as good as you read?

50:33.349 --> 50:34.618
I can.

50:36.520 --> 50:38.188
Here.

50:40.757 --> 50:43.327
I kept this
in case you wanted it.

50:44.427 --> 50:46.862
Show me. Show me
where it says her name.

50:46.864 --> 50:49.333
Where it says
"Hala."

50:51.434 --> 50:53.237
There. See?

50:53.904 --> 50:55.539
Hala.

51:13.322 --> 51:15.690
Do you know
what it means?

51:15.692 --> 51:17.360
No.

51:18.594 --> 51:22.496
Sometimes, on a clear night
when you look at the moon,

51:22.498 --> 51:25.168
you can see a bright
outline around it.

51:26.402 --> 51:29.804
That outline
is called hala.

51:29.806 --> 51:33.244
My wife was named
for that light.

51:42.418 --> 51:44.219
- Here.
- This is too much.

51:44.221 --> 51:46.454
Don't argue with me.

51:46.456 --> 51:47.692
Thank you.

51:56.465 --> 51:59.266
- [babbling]
- [laughing]

51:59.268 --> 52:02.938
Stop it, Zaki.
Can I pull yours?

52:02.940 --> 52:04.972
[babbling]

52:04.974 --> 52:07.809
[Soraya] Keep him quiet.
I'm trying to sleep.

52:07.811 --> 52:11.713
- What's the matter with you?
- Why don't you tell Zaki a story, hmm?

52:11.715 --> 52:13.414
We'd all like that.

52:13.416 --> 52:16.784
Well, Zaki, do you want to know
what happened to the boy?

52:16.786 --> 52:18.485
[babbling]

52:18.487 --> 52:20.755
Yes, yes,
and the elephant.

52:20.757 --> 52:22.324
[Zaki squeals]

52:22.326 --> 52:26.628
The boy ran and ran, his
heart beating fast in fear.

52:26.630 --> 52:29.798
<i>And the thing that chased him
never stopped.</i>

52:29.800 --> 52:32.566
[roaring]

52:32.568 --> 52:36.373
<i>So the boy hid behind a tree
and he waited for courage.</i>

52:40.943 --> 52:43.744
[grunting]

52:43.746 --> 52:46.981
<i>An ancient woman
had been trying to milk a goat,</i>

52:46.983 --> 52:49.416
<i>but her back was very sore.</i>

52:49.418 --> 52:54.856
My back is very sore.

52:54.858 --> 52:59.494
<i>The boy took pity on her and told her
to rest under the shade of a tree</i>

52:59.496 --> 53:01.563
<i>and he would do
the milking instead.</i>

53:01.565 --> 53:03.664
Please sit under
the shade of this tree,

53:03.666 --> 53:06.337
and I will do
the milking instead.

53:13.576 --> 53:15.610
<i>When he finished
milking the goat,</i>

53:15.612 --> 53:18.713
<i>the old woman shared
the lovely, warm milk with him.</i>

53:18.715 --> 53:22.684
- [slurping]
- <i>It was the nicest milk he had ever tasted,</i>

53:22.686 --> 53:25.353
<i>and he complimented the woman
on her goats.</i>

53:25.355 --> 53:27.554
Your goats
are very generous.

53:27.556 --> 53:30.791
<i>In return, the old woman
gave him a mirror.</i>

53:30.793 --> 53:34.996
See how it shines!

53:34.998 --> 53:37.499
<i>The boy was delighted
with the mirror,</i>

53:37.501 --> 53:42.607
<i>but as he looked into it, he saw the
reflection of the thing that followed him!</i>

53:46.909 --> 53:48.575
What are you doing,
Mama-jan?

53:48.577 --> 53:51.378
I'm laying out
Soraya's good clothes.

53:51.380 --> 53:53.715
Am I to sell them
at the market?

53:53.717 --> 53:56.721
Shh, shh, shh, Parvana.
It's time to sleep.

54:04.860 --> 54:08.496
[Shauzia] I just need to find
a way to get to Peshawar,

54:08.498 --> 54:10.632
and I can figure it out
from there.

54:10.634 --> 54:13.034
I think there's
a beach in Goa

54:13.036 --> 54:15.403
where the tourists
are very rich.

54:15.405 --> 54:17.604
If they're rich, they
would buy my blue stones,

54:17.606 --> 54:20.941
and that's where I'd set up my
business, and you could join me.

54:20.943 --> 54:23.077
Once I find Baba.

54:23.079 --> 54:25.415
Once you find your Baba.

54:26.483 --> 54:28.818
[aircraft approaching]

54:44.668 --> 54:45.967
100.

54:45.969 --> 54:47.469
I'll give you 85.

54:47.471 --> 54:48.702
- Ninety.
- Eighty-two.

54:48.704 --> 54:50.704
Eighty-five,
and that's final.

54:50.706 --> 54:53.344
Eighty-five and a bunch of
grapes, and that's final.

54:58.114 --> 55:02.583
You're leaning too hard on the
pen, but your writing is good.

55:02.585 --> 55:05.355
If you try it more gently,
it'll be easier.

55:10.860 --> 55:13.530
[chirping]

55:20.971 --> 55:23.907
[people chattering]

55:42.159 --> 55:44.528
Wait!
Wait a moment!

55:46.163 --> 55:48.028
What is it, child?

55:48.030 --> 55:51.733
You asked me before about the man who
used to sit there... the teacher.

55:51.735 --> 55:54.869
- Your uncle?
- He didn't go to Mazar-e-Sharif.

55:54.871 --> 55:58.039
He was taken to prison.
But he did nothing wrong.

55:58.041 --> 55:59.606
- Which one?
- What?

55:59.608 --> 56:01.909
- Which prison?
- Pul-e-Charkhi.

56:01.911 --> 56:05.448
It's been weeks now, and my
family has had no word of him.

56:07.516 --> 56:09.483
Go to the prison
on Wednesday.

56:09.485 --> 56:11.152
Ask for Roshan.
He's my cousin.

56:11.154 --> 56:14.724
Tell him Razaq sent you and
he will help you, if he can.

56:37.681 --> 56:40.483
[sighs]

56:41.150 --> 56:42.550
Deliwar!

56:42.552 --> 56:48.056
With work like this, I'll be an old
woman by the time I get to the sea.

56:48.058 --> 56:50.891
Or an old man.

56:50.893 --> 56:52.762
[groans]

56:56.099 --> 57:00.200
You sit and rest, Deliwar,
and I'll tell you a story.

57:00.202 --> 57:03.474
- A story?
- Yes, a story.

57:04.574 --> 57:06.139
One time
in the deep past,

57:06.141 --> 57:10.711
there was a boy who had to return a stolen
bag of precious seeds to his village.

57:10.713 --> 57:14.148
Is it a happy story
or a sad story?

57:14.150 --> 57:16.454
Just wait and see.

57:17.786 --> 57:20.822
The boy had been told
he needed three things

57:20.824 --> 57:23.992
in order to overcome
the Elephant King...

57:23.994 --> 57:27.862
something that shines, something
that ensnares and something that...

57:27.864 --> 57:30.733
[man]
Hey, you two! Come here!

57:32.101 --> 57:33.934
Come on!

57:33.936 --> 57:35.536
I know that boy.

57:35.538 --> 57:38.072
Hurry up. Come here.

57:38.074 --> 57:39.706
Come on.

57:39.708 --> 57:42.512
We'd better do
what we're told.

57:45.614 --> 57:47.650
Get a move on,
lazy kids.

57:52.155 --> 57:54.992
[laughing]

57:55.858 --> 57:57.891
So these are
the new workers?

57:57.893 --> 58:00.762
- [men laughing]
- Where are your tongues? Are you stupid?

58:00.764 --> 58:03.965
Idrees suggested we have a
little arm-wrestling match.

58:03.967 --> 58:04.965
[laughing continues]

58:04.967 --> 58:08.068
To see if you're strong
enough to work for me.

58:08.070 --> 58:10.704
I saw you sitting down
over there instead of working.

58:10.706 --> 58:12.706
- [gasps]
- Idrees, stop now.

58:12.708 --> 58:14.675
Make me some tea.
[laughing]

58:14.677 --> 58:16.980
[grunting, gasps]

58:18.648 --> 58:21.583
Let me see how feeble
<i>you</i> are, little one.

58:21.585 --> 58:22.849
[grunting]

58:22.851 --> 58:25.121
He can't even
lift his hand.

58:26.755 --> 58:29.058
Get up and make us tea.

58:30.326 --> 58:33.795
Uncle, I think
you need new workers.

58:33.797 --> 58:36.664
- These ones are no good.
- Enough, Idrees.

58:36.666 --> 58:38.298
Leave the poor kids alone.

58:38.300 --> 58:40.804
They are
a little undercooked.

58:44.641 --> 58:46.940
I know you.

58:46.942 --> 58:49.145
- You're the teacher's daugh...
- [grunts]

58:50.079 --> 58:52.815
[men laughing]

58:54.617 --> 58:56.751
- [angry shout]
- Idrees.

58:56.753 --> 58:58.753
Bring the gun back!

58:58.755 --> 59:00.787
I said
bring the gun back!

59:00.789 --> 59:03.693
- [angry shout]
- Idrees!

59:22.112 --> 59:23.911
Come out now!

59:23.913 --> 59:26.150
[grunting]

59:27.250 --> 59:29.282
Come out now!

59:29.284 --> 59:32.589
[kiln owner] Idrees, it has begun!
We are moving west.

59:33.657 --> 59:36.423
We have been given orders
to go immediately!

59:36.425 --> 59:38.659
I know who you are!

59:38.661 --> 59:40.163
Do you hear?

59:41.264 --> 59:43.364
Get up here! Come on!

59:43.366 --> 59:45.099
[gasping, panting]

59:45.101 --> 59:47.738
[kiln owner] Right now!
You little coward!

59:49.773 --> 59:53.744
You want to fight? Now
is your chance to fight!

59:55.712 --> 59:57.114
You become a man.

01:00:16.298 --> 01:00:18.201
[wind whistling]

01:00:20.070 --> 01:00:22.369
[Shauzia] He's gone.

01:00:22.371 --> 01:00:24.438
[Parvana]
What if he comes back?

01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:26.740
[Shauzia chuckles]
He'd be lucky.

01:00:26.742 --> 01:00:28.309
Where are we?

01:00:28.311 --> 01:00:30.711
I came here once
when I ran away.

01:00:30.713 --> 01:00:34.784
I think the way in has gotten
smaller or I have gotten bigger.

01:00:35.485 --> 01:00:37.253
It looks old.

01:00:38.154 --> 01:00:39.820
I lost a shoe.

01:00:39.822 --> 01:00:43.324
I lost my cap, although
I think it's outside.

01:00:43.326 --> 01:00:45.161
Why did you hit him?

01:00:47.730 --> 01:00:50.233
When they took my father,
he was one of them.

01:00:52.367 --> 01:00:54.101
Tell me more
about the boy.

01:00:54.103 --> 01:00:55.802
What boy?

01:00:55.804 --> 01:00:57.771
The story boy.

01:00:57.773 --> 01:01:00.507
The boy was cold.

01:01:00.509 --> 01:01:04.112
<i>Though the sun burned in
the sky, it gave no heat.</i>

01:01:04.114 --> 01:01:07.115
[Shauzia] <i>But he had a
warm hat and a big coat.</i>

01:01:07.117 --> 01:01:08.849
<i>No, he didn't.</i>

01:01:08.851 --> 01:01:11.318
<i>He had already found
one of the three things...</i>

01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:13.220
<i>a mirror that shone.</i>

01:01:13.222 --> 01:01:16.858
<i>But when he looked at it,
he saw something behind him.</i>

01:01:16.860 --> 01:01:19.527
<i>Something scary.
Something dreadful!</i>

01:01:19.529 --> 01:01:22.496
- <i>A horse!</i>
- <i>No, Shauzia, not a horse.</i>

01:01:22.498 --> 01:01:24.398
- [chuckling]
- <i>Yes, it was.</i>

01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:28.001
<i>And it was a very old horse whose bones
clattered together when it walked.</i>

01:01:28.003 --> 01:01:31.239
- <i>It wasn't scary at all.</i>
- [sighs]

01:01:31.241 --> 01:01:35.543
<i>Fine. The boy felt sad for the
old horse and fed him hay.</i>

01:01:35.545 --> 01:01:37.512
<i>And they all lived
happily ever after.</i>

01:01:37.514 --> 01:01:40.248
<i>It's the middle of the
story, not the end!</i>

01:01:40.250 --> 01:01:43.016
<i>From a door carved
into the stone,</i>

01:01:43.018 --> 01:01:45.318
- <i>out came a round man.</i>
- [grunts]

01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:49.389
You wasted my hay on an old
horse that will soon be dead!

01:01:49.391 --> 01:01:52.492
<i>The round man threw the boy deep
into the belly of an ancient well.</i>

01:01:52.494 --> 01:01:55.098
Aaah!

01:01:56.366 --> 01:01:58.999
<i>At the bottom of the well
there were emeralds,</i>

01:01:59.001 --> 01:02:03.070
<i>and the round man wanted them brought up
to him as payment for the wasted hay.</i>

01:02:03.072 --> 01:02:05.438
You will bring
the emeralds to me.

01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:07.474
- <i>What's his name?</i>
- <i>The round man?</i>

01:02:07.476 --> 01:02:09.242
No, the boy.

01:02:09.244 --> 01:02:12.479
You can't have a story about a
boy and not give him a name.

01:02:12.481 --> 01:02:14.414
Give him a name
before I do.

01:02:14.416 --> 01:02:16.284
Sulayman.

01:02:16.286 --> 01:02:18.789
His name is Sulayman.

01:02:19.422 --> 01:02:21.255
That's a good name.

01:02:21.257 --> 01:02:24.224
Sulayman lay
at the bottom of the well.

01:02:24.226 --> 01:02:27.327
- <i>Suddenly, he could see skeletons.</i>
- [growling]

01:02:27.329 --> 01:02:32.166
<i>Three skeletons, each with an
emerald clutched in its bony hands.</i>

01:02:32.168 --> 01:02:34.001
- <i>He called out for help.</i>
- Help!

01:02:34.003 --> 01:02:37.137
<i>The poor old horse looked
back at him from way above.</i>

01:02:37.139 --> 01:02:40.041
<i>But the horse did
something extraordinary.</i>

01:02:40.043 --> 01:02:42.976
<i>He neighed with the voice
of all the world's animals.</i>

01:02:42.978 --> 01:02:47.150
[neighing ferociously]

01:02:52.621 --> 01:02:55.923
<i>Sulayman climbed up, up,
all the way to the top,</i>

01:02:55.925 --> 01:02:58.291
<i>and he thanked the horse
for saving his life.</i>

01:02:58.293 --> 01:03:01.130
- Thank you for saving my life.
- [murmuring]

01:03:06.001 --> 01:03:08.469
<i>Sulayman had just
three emeralds with him...</i>

01:03:08.471 --> 01:03:11.472
- [laughing]
- <i>And asked the round man for food in return.</i>

01:03:11.474 --> 01:03:13.206
<i>He was hungry.</i>

01:03:13.208 --> 01:03:15.476
<i>But the round man
was wicked and cheap.</i>

01:03:15.478 --> 01:03:19.347
<i>He threw a fishing net at Sulayman
and he told him to get his own food.</i>

01:03:19.349 --> 01:03:22.617
- <i>That was exactly what Sulayman needed.</i>
- Ha-ha!

01:03:22.619 --> 01:03:25.019
<i>Something that ensnares.</i>

01:03:25.021 --> 01:03:26.621
<i>But as Sulayman left,</i>

01:03:26.623 --> 01:03:30.358
<i>the ghosts of the three skeletons
came out of the three emeralds</i>

01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:33.327
<i>and swirled and twirled
and scared the round man</i>

01:03:33.329 --> 01:03:36.630
<i>in frightful vengeance for
having lost them their lives.</i>

01:03:36.632 --> 01:03:39.001
[screaming]

01:03:40.904 --> 01:03:44.537
<i>Sulayman and the horse continued
their journey toward the mountain,</i>

01:03:44.539 --> 01:03:48.041
<i>but the horse was getting
slower and slower.</i>

01:03:48.043 --> 01:03:51.411
<i>He needed to rest,
being very, very old,</i>

01:03:51.413 --> 01:03:54.315
<i>and so Sulayman made a
shelter for the horse</i>

01:03:54.317 --> 01:03:57.018
<i>and told him
to wait for him.</i>

01:03:57.020 --> 01:03:59.387
- <i>The horse protested...</i>
- [whinnies]

01:03:59.389 --> 01:04:03.324
<i>but Sulayman knew he had to face
the Elephant King and the jaguars</i>

01:04:03.326 --> 01:04:04.958
<i>all by himself.</i>

01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:06.996
I will see you again,
old horse.

01:04:09.197 --> 01:04:11.268
<i>And so on he went alone.</i>

01:04:23.679 --> 01:04:26.012
Tomorrow is Wednesday.

01:04:26.014 --> 01:04:29.018
I'm going back there,
to the prison.

01:04:30.619 --> 01:04:32.955
They'll have to
let me see him then.

01:04:54.143 --> 01:04:56.177
From now on,
you're staying inside.

01:04:56.179 --> 01:04:58.445
- It's much too dangerous.
- No, Mama-jan.

01:04:58.447 --> 01:05:00.648
- We manage all right out there.
- "We"?

01:05:00.650 --> 01:05:04.585
Me and Deliwar. She's a girl too.
We work together.

01:05:04.587 --> 01:05:08.322
We've written to my cousin to arrange
a marriage for your sister in Mazar.

01:05:08.324 --> 01:05:10.458
They wrote back,
and it was accepted.

01:05:10.460 --> 01:05:13.327
Someone will come for us the day
after tomorrow to take us away.

01:05:13.329 --> 01:05:15.228
- You don't need to do this anymore.
- What?

01:05:15.230 --> 01:05:17.231
We can't go on
like this.

01:05:17.233 --> 01:05:19.733
- We can't depend on you to keep us alive.
- Why?

01:05:19.735 --> 01:05:21.601
I provide for you
just fine.

01:05:21.603 --> 01:05:23.771
It's not the job of a child.

01:05:23.773 --> 01:05:26.307
How can we leave
without Baba?

01:05:26.309 --> 01:05:28.775
Every day you come home
with cuts and blisters.

01:05:28.777 --> 01:05:32.481
Every day you go out there, and I don't
know if I'll see you back again.

01:05:33.616 --> 01:05:35.615
I can't lose you too.

01:05:35.617 --> 01:05:37.617
I'm not going.

01:05:37.619 --> 01:05:40.688
Baba could come back, and no one
will be here waiting for him.

01:05:40.690 --> 01:05:43.124
So how long
should we wait?

01:05:43.126 --> 01:05:45.559
Until you're found out
and taken away from me?

01:05:45.561 --> 01:05:47.795
Until I have to send Zaki out
to earn our keep?

01:05:47.797 --> 01:05:50.097
Let me go see him
before we leave.

01:05:50.099 --> 01:05:52.298
Let me tell him
where we are going.

01:05:52.300 --> 01:05:54.702
- Parvana!
- Let me bring him his walking stick.

01:05:54.704 --> 01:05:56.436
Then I will go with you.

01:05:56.438 --> 01:06:00.374
Then I will be a good sister
and a good daughter.

01:06:00.376 --> 01:06:01.979
I promise.

01:06:02.779 --> 01:06:04.380
I promise.

01:06:07.183 --> 01:06:09.987
[jets passing overhead]

01:06:19.462 --> 01:06:21.128
Please don't go.

01:06:21.130 --> 01:06:23.697
Please, it is much
too dangerous now.

01:06:23.699 --> 01:06:26.266
Mama-jan, I'm going.

01:06:26.268 --> 01:06:28.135
I'll be back tonight
before curfew.

01:06:28.137 --> 01:06:30.670
- No, Sulayman.
- Mama-jan.

01:06:30.672 --> 01:06:34.141
- You won't come back.
- Let her go now.

01:06:34.143 --> 01:06:36.279
Let Parvana go.

01:06:39.681 --> 01:06:42.385
[babbles]

01:06:43.485 --> 01:06:45.422
Oh! [babbles]

01:06:52.327 --> 01:06:54.431
Parvana.

01:07:27.797 --> 01:07:29.465
[gasps]

01:07:30.465 --> 01:07:32.101
Deliwar!

01:07:33.536 --> 01:07:36.470
[laughs] You frightened
me half to death.

01:07:36.472 --> 01:07:38.472
I've been looking
for you everywhere.

01:07:38.474 --> 01:07:41.407
Why? You want to work at the
chai shop with me this morning?

01:07:41.409 --> 01:07:45.311
- No, I can't.
- Hey, you want some candy for Zaki?

01:07:45.313 --> 01:07:48.150
We are leaving Kabul
tomorrow.

01:07:49.751 --> 01:07:51.619
You are leaving me?

01:07:51.621 --> 01:07:54.755
It's been arranged.
There's nothing I can do.

01:07:54.757 --> 01:07:58.893
My sister is getting
married in Mazar-e-Sharif.

01:07:58.895 --> 01:08:00.494
I'm going back
to the prison.

01:08:00.496 --> 01:08:02.496
I found someone
who can help me,

01:08:02.498 --> 01:08:04.731
and I need to get more money
to bribe the guard.

01:08:04.733 --> 01:08:06.633
I'll need it today.

01:08:06.635 --> 01:08:09.802
You'll just get another punch in the guts.
It's a stupid idea.

01:08:09.804 --> 01:08:11.639
I won't let that happen
this time.

01:08:11.641 --> 01:08:14.775
- I said it's a stupid idea.
- Please help me.

01:08:14.777 --> 01:08:16.644
What do you want me to do?

01:08:16.645 --> 01:08:19.912
Magic some money into your hand
like in your kids' stories?

01:08:19.915 --> 01:08:22.615
It doesn't work like that,
Parvana.

01:08:22.617 --> 01:08:24.585
I can't help you.

01:08:24.587 --> 01:08:28.689
Now run away to Mazar-e-Sharif
and have a nice wedding party.

01:08:28.691 --> 01:08:32.792
Maybe they'll find a husband for you
too and your troubles will be over.

01:08:32.794 --> 01:08:35.229
Until after the wedding,
at least.

01:08:35.231 --> 01:08:36.666
You fool!

01:08:39.801 --> 01:08:41.470
Deliwar!

01:08:42.537 --> 01:08:44.174
Shauzia.

01:08:52.682 --> 01:08:54.814
Shauzia.

01:08:54.816 --> 01:08:56.749
Come with us.

01:08:56.751 --> 01:08:59.286
I can't.

01:08:59.287 --> 01:09:02.424
My father would come all the
way to Mazar to kill me.

01:09:04.292 --> 01:09:07.296
I can't leave Kabul,
Parvana, not like this.

01:09:09.497 --> 01:09:12.233
- Here, take this.
- I can't take your money.

01:09:12.234 --> 01:09:14.203
Please take it.

01:09:17.305 --> 01:09:19.707
Go and see your Baba.

01:09:19.709 --> 01:09:23.777
Tell him that his daughter
is a good daughter.

01:09:23.779 --> 01:09:27.450
Tell him
that Deliwar said so.

01:09:33.723 --> 01:09:36.457
Hey, Deliwar.

01:09:36.459 --> 01:09:38.591
What?

01:09:38.593 --> 01:09:41.328
I'll meet you at that beach
you were talking about,

01:09:41.330 --> 01:09:43.997
where the moon
pulls the water,

01:09:43.999 --> 01:09:45.899
20 years from today.

01:09:45.901 --> 01:09:49.036
[chuckles] I don't think I'll
recognize you then, Aatish.

01:09:49.037 --> 01:09:53.242
Well, you can sell me some pretty
blue stones for a great price.

01:09:55.277 --> 01:09:57.347
Until next time then.

01:10:00.348 --> 01:10:02.615
Until next time.

01:10:02.617 --> 01:10:05.355
[jets approaching]

01:10:11.626 --> 01:10:13.629
[knocking]

01:10:20.669 --> 01:10:22.903
Peace be upon you.
Are you Fattema?

01:10:22.905 --> 01:10:24.104
Yes, I am Fattema.

01:10:24.106 --> 01:10:27.373
I am your second cousin. Mohammed
Abdul sent me from Mazar.

01:10:27.375 --> 01:10:29.743
Gather your family.
We must leave immediately.

01:10:29.745 --> 01:10:33.514
No, you see, you weren't
supposed to come so soon.

01:10:33.516 --> 01:10:36.050
My son is away. We must
wait for him to return.

01:10:36.052 --> 01:10:37.818
There is a war coming.
Have you not heard?

01:10:37.820 --> 01:10:39.920
We have to leave now
before they block the roads.

01:10:39.922 --> 01:10:42.689
We have to wait until she comes home.
I have to wait for my daughter.

01:10:42.691 --> 01:10:44.992
[angry grunt]
Son? Daughter? Which is it?

01:10:44.994 --> 01:10:46.859
Gather your things.
We are leaving now!

01:10:46.861 --> 01:10:49.762
I'm not leaving without Parvana.
We have to wait.

01:10:49.764 --> 01:10:51.765
Count yourself lucky
I'm taking you, old woman.

01:10:51.767 --> 01:10:53.766
The girl and the baby
are of more worth.

01:10:53.768 --> 01:10:55.668
I didn't come all this way
for nothing.

01:10:55.670 --> 01:10:58.105
If we do not go now, we won't
get out of here at all.

01:10:58.107 --> 01:11:00.640
- My baby! Give him to me!
- Let's go! Argh!

01:11:00.642 --> 01:11:02.544
- Zaki! Zaki!
- [Zaki screaming]

01:11:03.579 --> 01:11:06.113
Give me my baby.
Give him to me!

01:11:06.115 --> 01:11:08.285
- No! Give him to me!
- Let go! Let go!

01:11:19.695 --> 01:11:21.464
[engine idling]

01:11:23.432 --> 01:11:25.698
- Salaam, little one.
- Salaam.

01:11:25.700 --> 01:11:29.002
Where are you going to
with an old man's stick?

01:11:29.004 --> 01:11:31.605
It belongs to my Baba.

01:11:31.607 --> 01:11:34.577
I'm taking it to him,
to the prison.

01:11:35.710 --> 01:11:37.347
I see.

01:11:38.114 --> 01:11:40.349
We're going that way.

01:11:47.522 --> 01:11:49.155
- [Zaki crying]
- Give me my baby!

01:11:49.157 --> 01:11:52.693
- Let's go! If you want to keep the baby, come with me!
- Zaki!

01:11:52.695 --> 01:11:54.728
My daughter
is out there.

01:11:54.730 --> 01:11:57.131
Then what kind of fool are you
to have sent her out alone?

01:11:57.133 --> 01:12:00.033
Get in, or she won't be the
only child you'll lose today!

01:12:00.035 --> 01:12:02.836
Don't...
Give me my baby!

01:12:02.838 --> 01:12:04.738
Keep him quiet!

01:12:04.740 --> 01:12:06.707
I am begging you.

01:12:06.709 --> 01:12:11.614
- [engine cranking]
- Wait for my daughter!

01:12:52.987 --> 01:12:54.857
[shouting
in Afghan language]

01:12:58.827 --> 01:13:02.061
Come, Soraya.
We must start a fire.

01:13:02.063 --> 01:13:03.863
- [men shouting]
- [knocking]

01:13:03.865 --> 01:13:05.666
I am looking for Roshan.

01:13:05.668 --> 01:13:08.001
Hey!
I am looking for Roshan.

01:13:08.003 --> 01:13:11.471
I am looking for Roshan.
I am looking for Roshan.

01:13:11.473 --> 01:13:14.707
I am looking for Roshan.
I am looking for Roshan.

01:13:14.709 --> 01:13:16.909
- Open the door!
- Get away from the door, you stupid kid!

01:13:16.911 --> 01:13:19.179
- I am looking for Roshan!
- Get out of here!

01:13:19.181 --> 01:13:21.148
- I am looking for Roshan!
- Are you stupid?

01:13:21.150 --> 01:13:22.748
- I am looking for Roshan.
- Shut up!

01:13:22.750 --> 01:13:24.117
- What are you doing here?
- [gasps]

01:13:24.119 --> 01:13:27.054
It's all right.
He's my son.

01:13:27.056 --> 01:13:29.558
You're wanted inside.

01:13:31.259 --> 01:13:33.193
That boy needs
some discipline.

01:13:33.195 --> 01:13:34.998
That's my business.

01:13:37.967 --> 01:13:41.768
What in the name of the
merciful are you doing here?

01:13:41.770 --> 01:13:45.238
It's Wednesday. I've come
to meet your cousin Roshan.

01:13:45.240 --> 01:13:48.508
[scoffs]
There's a war started.

01:13:48.510 --> 01:13:50.644
Roshan has gone to fight.

01:13:50.646 --> 01:13:54.918
We've been brought from the city to clear the
prison of anyone who won't fight for us.

01:13:56.151 --> 01:13:57.950
- The teacher...
- Is he alive?

01:13:57.952 --> 01:13:59.619
I don't know.

01:13:59.621 --> 01:14:03.726
The teacher is my father.
I am Parvana, his daughter.
