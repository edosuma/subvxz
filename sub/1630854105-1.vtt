I got you
a little something.

01:35.337 --> 01:38.246
Mom, you do not have to keep
buying me things.

01:38.265 --> 01:39.581
I know,
but I like to spoil you.

01:39.600 --> 01:40.748
I do have clothes.

01:40.768 --> 01:42.342
I know you do.

01:42.436 --> 01:43.418
So I hope you're hungry,

01:43.512 --> 01:44.678
Because your brother
is gonna cook up

01:44.772 --> 01:45.437
Something very special for us
in the kitchen.

01:45.664 --> 01:46.588
Yes.

-Mr. Exceptional.
-Oh, come on.

01:48.851 --> 01:49.833
Don't be like that.

01:49.852 --> 01:50.776
He's worked hard.

01:50.927 --> 01:52.018
He wants to show off
a little bit.

Right. Right.
Right, right, right. Okay.

-Without a doubt.
-Okay.

Oh, wow.

Just the way you like it.

02:29.299 --> 02:30.149
Thank you.

I don't really know.
Is it?

you know?

02:54.658 --> 02:56.900
-In rehab?
-I mean, it was just...

02:56.919 --> 02:59.494
It was just not something
I really focused on.

02:59.588 --> 03:00.754
Maybe we don't need to care

03:00.906 --> 03:02.181
About our phones
at the table, huh?

03:02.332 --> 03:03.256
Yeah, honey,
let's put the phone down

03:03.350 --> 03:04.165
While we eat the food.

03:04.185 --> 03:05.333

03:05.352 --> 03:06.685
This is a big day.

-All right.

Welcome home. Welcome back.

I'm just gonna
check on the kitchen.

-[janie] all right.

I'm actually just gonna
stretch my legs real quick.

03:28.617 --> 03:29.599
I'll be right back. Okay?

03:29.618 --> 03:30.600
You okay?

03:30.619 --> 03:31.543
Yeah, I'm good.

03:36.550 --> 03:38.124
-Guys, eat.
-Okay.

03:38.219 --> 03:39.292
Yes, enjoy it.

03:39.445 --> 03:41.202
I feel like
it's missing strawberries.

03:41.296 --> 03:42.221
Can I ask for strawberries?

03:43.465 --> 03:44.539
Sorry about that, guys.

03:59.740 --> 04:01.031
[janie] I'm going to go down
and say bye to grace.

04:02.634 --> 04:04.058
Knock-knock.

04:04.152 --> 04:05.969
-Hey.
-Hey.

04:05.988 --> 04:08.321
It was great having breakfast
with the whole family.

04:08.415 --> 04:09.915
I wanted to say goodbye.

04:10.918 --> 04:11.875
Okay.

04:15.647 --> 04:16.421
I love this.

04:17.666 --> 04:18.573
It's not a shirt.

04:18.592 --> 04:19.907
[laughs]

04:19.927 --> 04:21.001
Yeah.

04:21.095 --> 04:22.819
I don't know, I just--

04:22.912 --> 04:25.672
I don't know if I'll ever
be the same as I was.

04:25.766 --> 04:26.598
You don't need to be.

04:27.917 --> 04:29.101
It's a beautiful part
of who you are.

04:32.106 --> 04:33.939
I don't want you to forget it.

04:35.851 --> 04:37.109
Mm-hmm.

04:39.280 --> 04:43.115
[♪]

04:43.342 --> 04:45.117
[janie] it was perfect!
Love you!

04:45.268 --> 04:46.451
Thank you!

04:49.031 --> 04:50.514
Well... What did you think?

04:50.607 --> 04:52.708
I thought...
I don't know.

04:54.853 --> 04:55.869
What is it?

04:55.963 --> 04:57.296
Nothing.

04:57.447 --> 04:59.873
Doesn't look like nothing.

05:00.025 --> 05:01.783
How do you think she was?

05:01.877 --> 05:03.785
Grace? I don't know.

05:03.804 --> 05:05.529
She seemed like...

05:05.547 --> 05:07.380
-Like what?
-Grace.

05:07.533 --> 05:09.199
What does that mean?

05:09.292 --> 05:11.217
Do you think she was withdrawn?
Or what?

05:11.370 --> 05:13.537
No, no, no.
Hey, hey.

05:13.630 --> 05:15.647
I just think
we need to give her...

05:15.874 --> 05:17.891
I don't know, some space,
that's all.

05:17.985 --> 05:20.043
Yeah.

05:20.136 --> 05:22.470
Well, I'll try to find
the new normal...

05:22.564 --> 05:25.231
Of how to just be with her,

05:25.326 --> 05:27.659
But I get a little bit concerned
that I'm...

05:29.163 --> 05:30.662
I don't know,

05:30.814 --> 05:32.889
That I'm looking after her
too much,

05:32.908 --> 05:33.907
That I'm looking at
every move that she makes

05:34.001 --> 05:35.408
Because I'm afraid of...

05:35.502 --> 05:37.669
Well, maybe I'm a little bit
afraid of her...

05:37.821 --> 05:40.154
Relapsing.

05:40.174 --> 05:42.399
Well, that's not unreasonable.

05:42.417 --> 05:43.583
Mm-hmm.

05:43.735 --> 05:46.494
You do need
to protect yourself.

05:46.513 --> 05:47.904
Last time was bad.

05:47.997 --> 05:49.348
Okay, but she needs
100% from us--

05:49.575 --> 05:51.241
100% all in.

05:51.259 --> 05:52.834
All in.

05:52.928 --> 05:54.594
She's not going to be alone.

05:54.688 --> 05:55.854
No, she's not.

05:56.081 --> 05:57.105
Hello!

05:58.417 --> 05:59.191
Are we leaving or what?

06:01.195 --> 06:02.861
-The influencer demands a ride.
-Yes, miss, yes, miss.

06:03.088 --> 06:05.271
-Your majesty.
-Can you take him?

06:05.424 --> 06:07.014
-Yes, I will.
-Thanks.

06:07.109 --> 06:07.941
Hey, can I be an influencer?

06:08.093 --> 06:09.183
No.

06:09.203 --> 06:10.660
-I think I could be.
-You can influence me.

06:19.104 --> 06:20.170
Oh, my god.

06:21.456 --> 06:22.672
-Hey.
-Hey.

06:24.200 --> 06:25.609
You're "the bird".

06:25.627 --> 06:27.794
That was a long time ago.

06:27.946 --> 06:29.446
Outstanding athlete,
senior year,

06:29.464 --> 06:31.297
Undefeated at every meet,

06:31.450 --> 06:32.616
Three years mvp for diving.

06:32.634 --> 06:34.634
How do you know all that?

06:34.728 --> 06:36.136
Your picture's
still on the awards board--

06:36.230 --> 06:38.713
But everybody knows about you.

06:38.807 --> 06:40.065
At least everyone
who hangs out here.

06:43.052 --> 06:44.144
Yeah, like I said,
that was...

06:44.238 --> 06:45.979
That was another life.

06:46.073 --> 06:47.322
I do not dive anymore.

06:50.577 --> 06:52.035
I really want to do
the two-and-a-half reverse tuck.

06:53.639 --> 06:54.804
That was your dive.

06:54.823 --> 06:55.822
Mm-hmm.

06:55.916 --> 06:57.040
Give me some tips?

06:58.994 --> 07:00.160
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

07:00.254 --> 07:01.086
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

07:01.313 --> 07:02.087
Sweet!

07:05.259 --> 07:09.678
[♪]

07:14.826 --> 07:15.917
You okay?

07:15.936 --> 07:17.327
Yeah.

07:17.345 --> 07:18.995
It's just
the last time I was up here,

07:19.014 --> 07:19.771
I almost broke my neck.

07:29.616 --> 07:32.192
[♪]

07:32.344 --> 07:33.952
Look, arm and leg position--

07:34.103 --> 07:36.179
That's all just technique.

07:36.198 --> 07:38.457
The best advice I can give you
isn't technique.

07:40.352 --> 07:41.609
When you are
all the way up here,

07:41.628 --> 07:42.961
It is just you--

07:43.188 --> 07:44.546
In the whole world.

07:46.800 --> 07:49.634
Okay, and once your feet
leave this platform,

07:49.786 --> 07:51.211
You have about two seconds

07:51.305 --> 07:53.555
Before you hit that water
at 35 miles per hour.

07:55.033 --> 07:56.716
So the only thing
that matters...

07:56.868 --> 07:58.218
Is that you believe
in yourself.

07:58.312 --> 08:00.061
100%.

08:01.648 --> 08:02.647
Okay?

08:03.817 --> 08:05.400
You got this.

08:12.326 --> 08:15.827
[♪]

08:27.733 --> 08:29.508
Hey.

08:30.919 --> 08:31.918
How's it going?

08:32.012 --> 08:34.404
I liked seeing you
up on that platform.

08:34.422 --> 08:37.073
Yeah, it was fun.

08:37.092 --> 08:39.834
Looked like you might even,
I don't know, dive again.

08:39.853 --> 08:42.503
Right.

08:42.597 --> 08:45.598
I don't know,
I just, I feel like I...

08:45.751 --> 08:47.267
I've lost something.

08:47.361 --> 08:48.527
A part of me.

08:48.754 --> 08:50.436
I'm not-- I'm not...

08:50.589 --> 08:52.364
I'm not me anymore.

08:52.591 --> 08:54.181
You know?

08:54.276 --> 08:56.017
You're going to get it back.

08:56.111 --> 08:57.761
You are going to be diving,

08:57.854 --> 08:59.020
You are going to be teaching,

08:59.039 --> 09:00.038
If that's what you want to do,

09:00.265 --> 09:02.265
You are going to get

09:02.358 --> 09:05.460
Your fearless,
brilliant self back.

09:06.788 --> 09:08.121
Mom, how do you--
how do you keep doing this?

09:08.215 --> 09:09.530
How do you...

09:09.624 --> 09:11.032
How do you have faith in me?

09:11.126 --> 09:12.217
Over and over again.

09:12.368 --> 09:14.702
After all the stuff
put you guys through.

09:14.721 --> 09:15.804
I'm your mom.

09:16.890 --> 09:18.056
And I trust you.

09:18.207 --> 09:20.016
I don't even trust myself!

09:22.287 --> 09:23.311
You know?

09:31.405 --> 09:33.797
Thank you.

09:33.815 --> 09:37.409
I know you're afraid...

09:37.560 --> 09:39.160
But it's going to be okay.

09:44.233 --> 09:45.542
I promise.

09:47.254 --> 09:48.878
Yeah.

09:54.261 --> 09:55.485
[janie] how many kids?

09:55.578 --> 09:57.244
-[woman] I think three.
-[man] three!

09:57.264 --> 09:58.430
[woman]
we've talked about this.

09:58.657 --> 09:59.747
Yeah, yeah.

09:59.766 --> 10:00.932
Exactly.

10:01.084 --> 10:02.158
Oh! Oh, we need a picture.

10:02.251 --> 10:03.676
Of course, of course.
Come on, come on.

10:03.770 --> 10:04.994
In front of the house.

10:05.013 --> 10:06.104
Here we go, here we go.

10:06.255 --> 10:07.180
What are you going to say?

10:07.274 --> 10:08.422
That's her department.

10:08.516 --> 10:10.166
Go. Three, two, one.

10:10.185 --> 10:11.443
Yes!

10:13.113 --> 10:14.337
Congratulations.

10:14.430 --> 10:15.855
Thank you.
We're so excited.

10:16.007 --> 10:18.007
I can't wait to start decorating
the baby's room.

10:18.101 --> 10:21.010
So, the closing
is on Wednesday at 2:00.

10:21.104 --> 10:23.270
By 4:00, this place
is gonna be yours.

10:23.365 --> 10:24.456
We're just so happy with it

10:24.683 --> 10:26.683
And, you know,
the community and everything.

10:26.776 --> 10:28.534
It's... So hard to find a town

10:28.629 --> 10:31.521
Not riddled with drug problems
these days.

10:31.539 --> 10:33.781
-Thank you, guys.
-Thank you so much.

10:33.875 --> 10:34.966
We'll see you on Wednesday.

10:35.118 --> 10:35.859
We'll see you
on Wednesday at the office.

10:35.952 --> 10:37.218
All right.

10:38.955 --> 10:40.621
Oh, I remember
being her, pregnant,

10:40.715 --> 10:41.640
And buying my first house.

10:41.867 --> 10:43.457
Thinking that
if I had the right house

10:43.551 --> 10:44.550
In the perfect neighborhood,

10:44.645 --> 10:45.869
Then everything would be okay,

10:45.962 --> 10:47.537
And I wouldn't have
any detours in my life.

10:47.630 --> 10:49.873
Yeah, well,
we were all innocent once.

10:49.891 --> 10:52.041
[laughs]
see you, guys.

10:52.135 --> 10:54.377
Well, if you didn't have
any detours,

10:54.470 --> 10:55.545
Then you wouldn't
have gotten divorced,

10:55.563 --> 10:57.230
And we...

10:57.324 --> 10:58.156
Wouldn't be together.

10:58.383 --> 10:59.549
You're cute.

10:59.642 --> 11:00.408
I am cute.

11:02.237 --> 11:03.328
Oh, but you know what--

11:03.479 --> 11:05.388
I have to show
the brighton house at 2:00.

11:05.407 --> 11:06.480
You want to join?

11:06.574 --> 11:07.724
I can't.
I have to work the desk.

11:07.742 --> 11:09.483
My boss is a slavedriver.

11:09.503 --> 11:10.835
Oh...

11:10.987 --> 11:12.729
I thought you married him.

11:12.747 --> 11:14.247
Oh, yeah.

11:14.341 --> 11:15.131
-I did.
-Okay.

11:16.343 --> 11:17.992
Have a good day.

11:18.011 --> 11:19.844
-Okay. See you at dinner.
-Mm-hmm.

11:22.349 --> 11:25.809
[♪]

11:33.360 --> 11:34.600
That was a long shift.

11:34.695 --> 11:35.676
Yeah.

11:35.696 --> 11:36.920
Should we unwind

11:36.938 --> 11:38.321
Before you head back
to your little basement?

11:39.441 --> 11:40.848
Cheers.

11:40.942 --> 11:42.108
-Tequila?
-Water.

11:42.260 --> 11:43.034
Mm.

11:43.186 --> 11:44.202
Tequila...

11:46.948 --> 11:47.947
Mm.

11:48.041 --> 11:49.791
So guess who I ran into.

11:52.287 --> 11:53.453
Richie?

11:53.547 --> 11:54.546
He was asking about you.

11:54.773 --> 11:55.863
Yeah, well,

11:55.957 --> 11:58.124
Tell him I moved to alaska.

11:58.218 --> 11:59.551
Or mars.

12:00.721 --> 12:02.387
Come on!

12:02.614 --> 12:03.388
What, did rehab
turn you into a nun?

12:04.799 --> 12:05.949
No.

12:06.042 --> 12:08.893
I just don't--
I don't need his trouble.

12:11.380 --> 12:12.814
So, that's that.

12:15.810 --> 12:17.293
You know, he tattooed
your name on his arm.

12:17.312 --> 12:18.294
He did?

12:18.313 --> 12:19.237
Mm-hmm.

12:19.464 --> 12:20.697
Right here.

12:23.301 --> 12:24.576
Yeah...

12:24.803 --> 12:26.077
Yeah, no...

12:26.304 --> 12:27.320
Seriously...

12:27.414 --> 12:28.830
He's trouble.

12:32.160 --> 12:34.235
This makeup palette is amazing.

12:34.329 --> 12:35.420
What brush is that?

12:35.647 --> 12:36.755
It's the...

12:36.982 --> 12:37.756
Let's see...

12:39.242 --> 12:40.258
Um, it really doesn't matter
what brush you're using,

12:40.485 --> 12:42.318
-As long as it's--
-[otis barks]

12:42.337 --> 12:43.428
Dad!

12:48.343 --> 12:49.851
Hi. Hi!

12:51.438 --> 12:52.996
Dad... Really?

12:53.014 --> 12:54.180
Hi.

12:54.332 --> 12:57.000
This dog completely
destroyed my tiktok.

12:57.018 --> 12:58.851
Oh, no.

12:58.945 --> 12:59.944
I'm so sorry about that.

13:00.171 --> 13:02.021
We were unaware
that you were "working".

13:02.173 --> 13:03.448
-It's not funny.
-It's kinda funny.

13:04.676 --> 13:05.766
Is it funny?

13:05.786 --> 13:07.268
How long is this dog
gonna be staying here?

13:07.287 --> 13:08.845
Otis?

13:08.938 --> 13:10.680
Who knows?

13:10.698 --> 13:11.539
A couple weeks.
Till grace gets on her feet.

13:13.018 --> 13:14.626
-Hi.
-Hi, janie.

13:14.777 --> 13:15.627
Hi, honey.

13:19.800 --> 13:21.858
Let me know if you need
any help with the tiktoking--

13:21.876 --> 13:23.543
Toking...

13:23.695 --> 13:24.710
You know,
it might do her some good

13:24.863 --> 13:27.213
To get out of that bedroom
once in a while.

13:27.307 --> 13:28.789
Maybe a little exercise?

13:28.809 --> 13:29.790
Maybe...

13:29.884 --> 13:32.811
Maybe she should
swim with grace.

13:35.557 --> 13:37.223
-Toni and grace?
-Yeah.

13:37.317 --> 13:38.374
I think it would be nice

13:38.467 --> 13:41.544
If they built
a relationship together.

13:41.563 --> 13:44.213
She swims every day.
They could have some fun.

13:44.232 --> 13:45.731
Yeah, it's just been
a couple hard years with grace.

13:45.884 --> 13:46.974
I know.

13:46.993 --> 13:48.827
It's a lot to process
for a teenage girl.

13:49.054 --> 13:49.902
I mean, it's a lot
to process for me,

13:49.996 --> 13:51.070
You know what I mean?

13:51.164 --> 13:52.071
I understand,
but this time's different.

13:52.165 --> 13:53.239
She's better.

13:53.391 --> 13:54.165
You can see it in her eyes,
can't you?

13:58.988 --> 14:00.321
I really wish
every conversation we had

14:00.415 --> 14:01.673
Wasn't about how messed up
gracie is.

14:07.013 --> 14:07.929
I'm working on it, okay?

14:10.758 --> 14:12.758
I know, I know.

14:12.853 --> 14:14.001
Want to do a makeup tutorial?

14:14.095 --> 14:15.603
-Yes.
-Okay.

14:18.583 --> 14:19.432
[grace]<i> this is rex's.</i>

14:19.584 --> 14:21.008
How can I help you today?

14:21.027 --> 14:22.193
A little gift from an admirer.

14:25.365 --> 14:26.698
Um... Yes.

14:26.849 --> 14:28.491
Sorry, table for how many?

14:31.613 --> 14:33.930
Okay, perfect.
Thank you.

<i> You can do better than that.</i>

15:55.180 --> 15:56.788
<i> You like the necklace?</i>

15:57.015 --> 15:59.606
Yeah, it was, um...

It was really nice, richie.

16:17.960 --> 16:19.552
Hey, theo!

You being a good boy?

16:20.722 --> 16:21.721
[richie]<i> tell her you miss her.</i>

16:21.815 --> 16:23.564
<i> I miss you, gracie!</i>

[richie]<i> get your jammies on.</i>
<i> Go on.</i>

16:31.399 --> 16:32.215
How's he doing?

16:32.308 --> 16:34.641
<i> Yeah, he's great, you know?</i>

16:34.736 --> 16:35.976
<i> The old lady's a bitch--</i>

16:37.405 --> 16:39.313
<i> But he's good.</i>

16:39.407 --> 16:40.164
<i> He always asks about you.</i>

16:45.005 --> 16:46.562
So...

16:46.581 --> 16:48.564
Is it true that

16:48.657 --> 16:51.584
You got a tattoo
of my name on your wrist?

16:51.736 --> 16:52.418
<i> You don't believe me?</i>

16:52.570 --> 16:53.827
No.

16:53.921 --> 16:55.763
<i> I'll show you.</i>

16:57.258 --> 16:58.182
<i> Naw...</i>

16:58.409 --> 16:59.183

I can't.

17:02.930 --> 17:04.247
I...

17:04.340 --> 17:06.173
I need to get
my life together.

17:06.192 --> 17:08.918
I need to be careful,

17:08.936 --> 17:09.935
<i> Okay.</i>

<i> No worries, babe.</i>

17:49.644 --> 17:51.027
[janie] you're really sweet,
you know?

17:52.980 --> 17:54.030
I've been thinking about
what you said...

17:55.316 --> 17:57.075
...About detours.

17:57.302 --> 17:58.201
Get in here.

17:59.804 --> 18:00.745
I mean, you met me,

18:00.972 --> 18:01.821
And I was...

18:01.973 --> 18:02.747
Divorced.

18:02.974 --> 18:04.323
I had...

18:04.417 --> 18:05.333
Two teenaged kids.

18:07.145 --> 18:08.828
It was...

18:08.922 --> 18:10.254
The opposite of easy.

18:12.500 --> 18:13.591
You dated me anyway.

18:13.818 --> 18:15.167
Why did you date me?

18:15.261 --> 18:16.761
I thought you were rich.

18:20.491 --> 18:21.933
You gave me a second chance.

18:25.330 --> 18:26.729
I'm really grateful to you.

18:29.183 --> 18:30.924
And grace is getting
another chance,

18:31.018 --> 18:33.018
And I really...

18:33.171 --> 18:34.278
Want her to embrace it,
you know?

18:37.024 --> 18:38.199
Me too.

18:39.527 --> 18:41.619
And, hey, I'm getting
a second chance, too.

[♪]

18:55.468 --> 18:56.450
-Grace, hey.
-Hey.

18:56.469 --> 18:57.451
Are you working?

18:57.470 --> 18:58.878
No. What's up?

18:59.030 --> 19:00.029
Okay, I'm so glad
I ran into you.

19:00.047 --> 19:01.364
I need your help.

19:01.457 --> 19:03.457
Richie's kid, theo, got hurt.

19:03.476 --> 19:04.700
What?

19:04.719 --> 19:06.202
Yeah, and he needs
to go to the hospital,

19:06.295 --> 19:07.052
And richie
doesn't have insurance,

19:07.147 --> 19:08.146
And he needs cash.

19:09.315 --> 19:10.055
Okay.

19:10.208 --> 19:11.891
Can you bring this to him?

19:12.043 --> 19:13.058
I was just about
to go to the pool.

19:13.153 --> 19:14.877
Can't you get it to him?

19:14.970 --> 19:17.638
I know it's a lot to ask,
but I've got a shift.

19:17.657 --> 19:18.731
Okay.

19:18.825 --> 19:20.158
Yes. Okay.

19:20.385 --> 19:21.242
Yeah, okay, just go.

19:22.311 --> 19:23.327
Thank you.

19:23.554 --> 19:24.478
Richie will let you know
where to meet him.

19:24.497 --> 19:25.237
Okay.

19:25.390 --> 19:27.081
-You're the best.
-Okay.

19:36.676 --> 19:37.824
So can I take the car?

19:37.919 --> 19:40.827
Oh, right, the car.

19:40.922 --> 19:42.087
-Mom?
-Yeah?

19:42.182 --> 19:44.757
I wouldn't be asking
if it wasn't an emergency.

19:44.851 --> 19:47.092
I know, honey,
but it's kind of toni's car.

19:47.187 --> 19:50.079
And who is this child?

19:50.097 --> 19:51.580
It's a friend of red's.

19:51.599 --> 19:52.581
Red is?

19:52.675 --> 19:54.583
She's a waitress
from the restaurant.

19:54.602 --> 19:56.101
She waited on us.

19:56.196 --> 19:57.177
I mean, she would do it,

19:57.271 --> 19:58.512
But she has a shift,

19:58.606 --> 19:59.280
So I'm just trying to help.

20:00.533 --> 20:02.033
Right.

20:02.184 --> 20:03.367
You really
don't trust me, do you?

20:04.871 --> 20:05.778
Honey, I do trust you.

20:05.930 --> 20:06.779
I...

20:06.931 --> 20:08.948
Worry about your choices
sometimes.

20:09.042 --> 20:10.190
No, you don't.

20:10.210 --> 20:11.951
You're the one
who's coming into my room,

20:12.103 --> 20:13.527
Telling me
how proud you are of me,

20:13.621 --> 20:15.046
And how much you believe in me.

20:16.699 --> 20:18.049
But you don't even trust me--
at all.

20:19.961 --> 20:20.793
Look, you know what,
I don't need your help.

20:20.887 --> 20:22.220
I'll ask someone else.

20:22.447 --> 20:24.055
No, I'm sorry-- I'm sorry,
I shouldn't have hesitated.

What was he doing
in new jersey?

26:44.770 --> 26:45.677
I have no idea.

26:45.771 --> 26:46.604
That's 40 miles away!

26:48.515 --> 26:49.998
Maybe I should call the police.

26:50.092 --> 26:51.667
It's too soon.
They can't do anything.

26:51.685 --> 26:52.776

Maybe we should face the facts.

27:07.518 --> 27:08.459
She's not doing drugs.

27:08.610 --> 27:10.202
She was running an errand

Okay? We can't be

It doesn't make
any sense, burt.

27:16.861 --> 27:17.860
She cares about that dog

27:17.953 --> 27:19.027

she cares about herself.

She'd never leave him

27:28.130 --> 27:29.980
I think something
happened to her.

27:31.984 --> 27:33.317
I know something
happened to her.

worked for you before?

34:24.454 --> 34:25.470
Did you find anybody like that?

34:25.622 --> 34:26.730
You're just gonna type it on in,

34:26.957 --> 34:28.398
And then,
gee, we're gonna find her!

34:28.625 --> 34:29.900
Is there a lot of success
with that?

34:30.127 --> 34:31.142
I do wish there was more
we could do.

34:31.295 --> 34:32.051
So why don't you do it?

34:32.145 --> 34:34.145
-Janie...
-What?

34:34.239 --> 34:36.722
Why isn't he--
why aren't you doing anything?

34:36.817 --> 34:37.982
Janie, grace is an adult.

34:38.135 --> 34:39.651
Yes, I understand that.

34:39.745 --> 34:40.652
Who's missing.

34:40.746 --> 34:41.912
Appreciate it--

34:42.063 --> 34:43.154
But there's nothing here

34:43.248 --> 34:44.414
That indicates
that a crime has taken place.

34:44.566 --> 34:45.731
Something happened to her!

34:45.751 --> 34:47.492
Adults are free to come and go

34:47.644 --> 34:49.160
And even disappear
if they want to, okay?

34:49.313 --> 34:50.328
Oh.

34:50.480 --> 34:52.163
So, honestly,
our hands really are tied.

34:52.316 --> 34:53.239
Okay...

34:53.258 --> 34:54.649
And that's exactly
what you would do

34:54.742 --> 34:56.167
With your own daughter, right?

34:56.320 --> 34:57.669
You'd just put in her name
in the database, call it a day?

34:57.763 --> 34:59.337
I don't think so.

34:59.489 --> 35:00.597
What would you do
if it were your daughter?

35:00.748 --> 35:02.248
If it were my daughter,
I'd follow the drugs.

35:02.267 --> 35:04.326
Oh...

35:04.344 --> 35:05.994
Find out who her dealer was

35:06.012 --> 35:06.770
And who she gets high with.

35:08.423 --> 35:10.423
You ask them some questions,
something's gonna turn up.

35:10.442 --> 35:11.399
Okay.

35:14.262 --> 35:15.112
-Thanks for the tip.
-You're welcome.

35:17.449 --> 35:18.615
Thanks, detective.

35:23.029 --> 35:24.246
[burt] hey.

35:25.440 --> 35:26.957
[janie] unbelievable.

35:27.108 --> 35:27.940
She's out there somewhere.

35:27.960 --> 35:28.941
They're not even gonna find her

35:28.961 --> 35:29.942
Because they don't
care about her--

35:29.962 --> 35:30.852
Just like you!

35:30.945 --> 35:31.944
Nobody cares about her, burt.

35:31.964 --> 35:33.872
Dammit! That's not fair.
I'm here.

35:34.024 --> 35:35.190
-I'm here with you!
-Yeah.

35:35.283 --> 35:36.949
Okay, I just don't have
rose-colored glasses on.

35:36.969 --> 35:38.468
What?

35:38.695 --> 35:39.952
I don't have
rose-colored glasses on.

35:39.972 --> 35:40.929
Neither do I.

35:42.549 --> 35:44.048
This is my family, too.

35:44.201 --> 35:45.550
Okay? It is.

35:45.702 --> 35:46.977
And it's my job
to protect it--

35:47.128 --> 35:48.370
And I can't let grace
destroy it again.

35:48.388 --> 35:49.646
Oh, please!

35:49.873 --> 35:51.373
She didn't destroy it, burt,
I did--

35:51.466 --> 35:52.891
When I kicked her
out of the house

35:53.043 --> 35:54.151
Told her that she couldn't
come back in,

35:54.378 --> 35:54.876
And they found her
on the curb the next morning,

35:54.895 --> 35:56.060
Almost dead.

35:56.213 --> 35:56.878
She made her choice.

35:56.897 --> 35:58.213
No. No.

35:58.231 --> 35:59.281
No.

36:01.051 --> 36:02.233
She was a teenager!

36:02.327 --> 36:03.493
I am the mother!

36:06.573 --> 36:07.664
I'm not gonna
fail her twice, burt.

36:09.001 --> 36:10.000
So you pick your side.

36:12.987 --> 36:14.129
[vomiting]

36:19.344 --> 36:20.343
Hey, hey, hey.

36:20.495 --> 36:21.344
I got you.

36:24.349 --> 36:25.682
Hey, come on.

36:27.352 --> 36:28.310
[vomiting]

36:34.175 --> 36:35.358
I can't hurt your face, can I?

36:41.033 --> 36:42.199
I own you, bitch.

36:44.277 --> 36:45.368
I own you!

36:51.693 --> 36:52.542
[vomiting]

36:55.363 --> 36:56.862
Look, mrs. Atkinson,

36:56.882 --> 36:58.864
I've always been really sorry
about what happened to grace.

36:58.959 --> 37:00.625
I never expected things...

37:00.777 --> 37:01.776
You know,

37:01.795 --> 37:03.369
Would get
so out of control, for her.

37:03.463 --> 37:04.796
I appreciate that.

37:04.948 --> 37:06.614
What I need to know

37:06.633 --> 37:09.542
Is if she has
contacted you lately.

37:09.561 --> 37:10.393
Have you seen her?

37:12.064 --> 37:14.456
Me? Look, I've been clean
since high school.

37:14.474 --> 37:16.624
She went her way, and I...

37:16.643 --> 37:17.625
Went mine.

37:17.644 --> 37:19.385
It's beautiful.

37:19.479 --> 37:20.237
I need to find her.

37:22.074 --> 37:23.573
Oh, no. Is she...
Is she using again?

37:25.577 --> 37:26.576
I don't know.

37:26.728 --> 37:28.970
But it doesn't matter.

37:29.063 --> 37:30.914
Either way,
I need to find her,

37:31.065 --> 37:32.140
And if she is using,

37:32.158 --> 37:34.233
I need to know...

37:34.327 --> 37:35.568
Where she gets her drugs.

37:35.662 --> 37:36.920
Look, I told you...

37:37.071 --> 37:38.146
I'm clean.

37:38.239 --> 37:40.148
-Beth--
-I'm out of that whole thing.

37:40.166 --> 37:42.241
How would I know
where she would get drugs?

37:42.335 --> 37:43.093
Beth, I need a name.

37:44.488 --> 37:45.911
Or the name of somebody
who knows a name.

37:45.931 --> 37:47.580
She's...

37:47.599 --> 37:48.890
Missing.

37:50.084 --> 37:51.101
Please!
You were her best friend.

37:52.496 --> 37:53.678
I...

37:53.830 --> 37:54.920
Just need your help.

37:55.015 --> 37:56.773
There's a guy named cray.

37:58.685 --> 37:59.851
"there's a guy named cray."

38:00.003 --> 38:01.111
You can find him
in ambrose park.

38:03.765 --> 38:04.614
Thank you.

38:05.951 --> 38:07.284
Thank you!

38:09.621 --> 38:10.787

38:55.000 --> 38:57.983
Help me!

38:58.003 --> 38:59.336
Help!

39:01.231 --> 39:03.322
Help! Help!

39:03.342 --> 39:06.634
Help!

39:10.574 --> 39:12.682
Help!

39:16.246 --> 39:18.079
Mom! Mom!

39:18.098 --> 39:19.356
Mom!

39:26.013 --> 39:29.181
Like I said, right?
Hot. Young.

39:29.201 --> 39:31.275
[derek] she's just another
16-year-old mexican girl.

39:31.428 --> 39:32.702
[richie] no.

39:32.854 --> 39:33.853
She's broken in good.

39:33.872 --> 39:34.871
No complaints
from her hot little ass.

39:36.691 --> 39:37.857
I'll give you two gs.

39:37.876 --> 39:39.525
What!

39:39.544 --> 39:41.119
She's an atm machine!
She's 17 years old!

39:41.271 --> 39:42.286
She's worth twice that.

39:42.439 --> 39:43.880
Take it or leave it.

39:44.031 --> 39:45.048
I got three others
coming from mexico.

39:45.275 --> 39:46.457
Come on.

39:46.610 --> 39:48.176
I'm like an ellis island.

39:49.295 --> 39:50.720
Okay, well, the next one
I got's white.

39:50.872 --> 39:52.037
Full-on u.S. Of a.
Cheerleader type.

39:52.057 --> 39:53.948
[derek] yeah?

39:53.967 --> 39:54.891
When's she ready?

39:55.042 --> 39:56.375
A few more days.

39:56.395 --> 39:57.852
Give me some time.

39:59.213 --> 40:00.397
You're not getting her
for less than five grand.

40:03.068 --> 40:04.567
Okay.

40:04.719 --> 40:06.461
Break her in,
just not too hard.

40:06.479 --> 40:07.570
No one likes
a zombie skank.

40:10.800 --> 40:11.983
And hose that one down,

40:12.135 --> 40:13.701
I'll be back at midnight
and I'll buy her from you.

40:20.477 --> 40:22.493
[♪]

40:22.646 --> 40:23.920
Yes!

40:35.842 --> 40:38.268
I guess there's no point
in asking you to come to bed.

40:39.663 --> 40:44.256
I knew... I knew...

40:44.276 --> 40:46.759
I knew the doctor
was giving her pain pills.

40:46.853 --> 40:48.278
No, janie, this was not--

40:48.429 --> 40:49.671
And I didn't stop it.

40:49.764 --> 40:50.930
It was right under my nose
and I didn't stop it.

40:50.949 --> 40:52.932
This was not your fault.

40:52.951 --> 40:54.342
It was not your fault.

40:54.360 --> 40:55.743
It was.

40:57.772 --> 40:58.746
You can't think like that.

41:00.125 --> 41:01.249
Honey...

41:04.779 --> 41:06.087
It's not your fault.

41:07.524 --> 41:08.631
Okay?

41:10.877 --> 41:12.469
[school bell rings]

41:19.219 --> 41:21.478
Come on, don't be shy.
You've got to include me, huh?

41:24.390 --> 41:25.648
So, how much you guys need?

41:27.377 --> 41:28.985
So her again?
Come on, man.

41:30.489 --> 41:31.321
Okay, light me up.

41:36.143 --> 41:37.327
She's a little cutie, huh?

41:39.146 --> 41:40.646
You're a dirty
son-of-a-bitch, you.

41:40.665 --> 41:42.223
So, what, shotguns
every hour on the hour,

41:42.316 --> 41:43.558
With some momentum
here, boys.

41:43.576 --> 41:44.667
Hi.

41:44.819 --> 41:46.410
Excuse me.

41:46.563 --> 41:47.504
So what time?
Come on.

41:49.674 --> 41:50.507
Are you cray?

41:51.676 --> 41:52.509
Who's asking?

41:54.087 --> 41:56.070
I'm grace atkinson's mom.

41:56.089 --> 41:56.846
I don't know her.

42:01.019 --> 42:01.926
There's no reason
to be nervous or lie,

42:02.078 --> 42:04.169
I just...

42:04.264 --> 42:05.504
I don't want any trouble.

42:05.524 --> 42:06.672
I just--

42:06.691 --> 42:08.082
Lady, I told you--

42:08.101 --> 42:10.175
Look, I just want to know
if you've seen her lately.

42:10.195 --> 42:11.586
What? She's hurt or something?

42:11.604 --> 42:12.529
That's what I want to know.

42:13.923 --> 42:15.198
I really...

42:15.349 --> 42:16.533
I really want to know
if she's...

42:16.684 --> 42:17.825
...If she's using again.

42:21.039 --> 42:22.830
Please.
Anything you know.

42:24.768 --> 42:25.783
Yeah.

42:25.935 --> 42:27.043
Heard she was out of rehab.

42:28.046 --> 42:29.045
Saw her.

42:30.456 --> 42:31.214
Talked about some rims.

42:32.551 --> 42:33.883
Some what?

42:34.110 --> 42:35.868
Oxy.

42:35.962 --> 42:36.719
I tried to sell her some.

42:38.205 --> 42:39.681
She turned me down.

42:41.117 --> 42:42.058
Told me she was staying
straight this time.

42:44.229 --> 42:45.061
She meant it.

42:46.731 --> 42:48.881
She's good people.

42:48.900 --> 42:50.141
Sat next to her
in eighth-grade english.

42:50.293 --> 42:51.192
Yeah?

42:52.645 --> 42:53.903
She is.

42:58.410 --> 42:59.867
You're all good kids.

43:02.414 --> 43:03.746
You're welcome.

43:25.829 --> 43:28.012
Now, this...

43:28.164 --> 43:29.088
This is a sandwich.

43:29.182 --> 43:30.923
I love the classics.

43:30.942 --> 43:32.609
That's what this place
is all about.

43:32.836 --> 43:34.110
Really,
I learned it all from mom.

43:35.280 --> 43:36.112
How's she doing?

43:38.116 --> 43:40.007
I love your mom,

43:40.026 --> 43:43.077
And she's steadfast
in her belief in grace.

43:44.864 --> 43:46.105
I don't know
if she can go through it again.

43:46.199 --> 43:47.248
Even as strong as she is.

43:48.793 --> 43:49.626
I don't know.

43:49.853 --> 43:51.686
I wouldn't underestimate
your mom.

43:51.704 --> 43:52.870
She's one of the strongest
people I've ever met.

43:53.022 --> 43:54.689
I know.

43:54.707 --> 43:57.208
It's just...

43:57.360 --> 43:58.951
You know, grace and I
were always so close,

43:58.970 --> 44:01.529
And...

44:01.547 --> 44:02.380
There was nothing
we couldn't tell each other,

44:02.532 --> 44:03.973
And then...

44:04.200 --> 44:06.142
I don't know,
I just feel helpless

44:06.293 --> 44:07.718
'cause there's nothing
I can do for her,

44:07.871 --> 44:10.888
And then I start to feel guilty

44:11.040 --> 44:12.874
For not being
more of a brother.

44:12.967 --> 44:14.150
I can only imagine
how mom feels.

44:16.470 --> 44:17.469
This is what parents do.

44:17.563 --> 44:19.155
Loving unconditionally.

44:20.325 --> 44:21.382
That's the deal.

44:21.401 --> 44:23.401
Your mom...

44:23.553 --> 44:25.662
She feels the same way
about both of you.

44:30.243 --> 44:32.651
Just because I don't say it,

44:32.671 --> 44:33.961
Don't think
that you're unappreciated.

44:35.656 --> 44:37.173
Especially by mom.

44:39.736 --> 44:41.493
Thanks.

44:49.262 --> 44:49.977
Yeah, he's...
He's right here.

44:51.431 --> 44:52.430
No way.

44:52.582 --> 44:53.481
They found the car.

44:54.918 --> 44:56.083
Yeah. Yeah.

44:56.102 --> 44:56.842
Okay, yeah, he's on his way.

44:56.861 --> 44:57.768
Okay.

44:57.921 --> 44:59.178
I'll go.
I'll call you shortly.

44:59.197 --> 45:00.196
Yeah.

You got a job now.

45:05.370 --> 45:06.202
Take it.

45:10.357 --> 45:11.190
Are you listening to me?
Hey, hey!

45:11.209 --> 45:13.601
Hey, look at me, okay?

45:13.619 --> 45:15.694
You're gonna go in there
and exchange what you bought.

45:15.714 --> 45:17.196
For cash.
All right?

45:17.215 --> 45:18.339
Don't let them
put it back on your card.

45:22.111 --> 45:23.444
I just want to go home.

45:23.463 --> 45:24.053
-Are you getting this?
-Please.

45:25.890 --> 45:27.056
Listen to me.

45:29.786 --> 45:30.727
I'm gonna be right behind you,
all right?

45:32.564 --> 45:34.046
One mistake...

45:34.140 --> 45:35.064
And I'll kill you.

45:36.568 --> 45:37.808
I will kill you.

45:37.902 --> 45:39.460
Say it.

45:39.479 --> 45:41.237
You'll kill me.

45:44.317 --> 45:46.409
Be a good girl and I'll get you
something to eat, all right?

45:51.916 --> 45:52.749
Get out.

46:27.786 --> 46:32.288

46:39.539 --> 46:41.038
It doesn't make any sense.

46:41.190 --> 46:43.949
They say...

46:43.968 --> 46:45.927
That they towed the car
from here...

46:47.547 --> 46:48.471
None of this makes sense.

46:51.142 --> 46:52.141
What is that?

46:54.720 --> 46:55.978
Is that a security camera?

46:56.130 --> 46:57.038
[burt]
that's exactly what that is.

46:57.056 --> 46:58.481
Nail salon.
Go. Go, go.

47:53.930 --> 47:54.871
I...

47:55.022 --> 47:56.372
I need to return this.

48:04.698 --> 48:06.883
You just bought this
an hour ago?

48:07.034 --> 48:08.533
Is it broken?

48:08.628 --> 48:09.719
I just need to return it.

48:10.889 --> 48:12.054
Cash only.

48:19.397 --> 48:24.025
[♪]

48:28.222 --> 48:29.906
I'll take these, too.

48:44.814 --> 48:49.425

48:51.262 --> 48:52.428
Let's go.

48:53.431 --> 48:54.764
Come on.

49:05.184 --> 49:06.758
[janie] we need your help!

49:06.778 --> 49:08.502
[burt] hi, hi. Sorry.

49:08.595 --> 49:09.445
We were just
in your parking lot.

49:09.672 --> 49:10.521
You guys got
a security camera there.

49:10.673 --> 49:11.447
Can we take a look
at that footage?

49:11.674 --> 49:13.357
No. Nails only.
We have policy.

49:13.451 --> 49:14.433
Not possible.

49:14.452 --> 49:16.268
Please.
My daughter is missing.

49:16.287 --> 49:17.678
She parked her car
in that parking lot

49:17.697 --> 49:18.603
And then she went missing.

49:18.698 --> 49:19.530
I think she's in trouble.

49:19.624 --> 49:21.415
Won't you please
help us find her?

49:22.535 --> 49:23.292
Please!

49:25.463 --> 49:26.295
What's the date?

49:28.024 --> 49:29.373
-Today's the 16th?
-Yeah, five days ago.

49:29.467 --> 49:31.133
The 11th.

49:31.285 --> 49:32.301
I gave her the car
in the afternoon.

49:37.791 --> 49:38.599
That's the 11th.

49:43.206 --> 49:44.371
There. Right there.

49:44.390 --> 49:45.272
That's the car.

49:52.215 --> 49:53.114
That's her!

49:55.551 --> 49:56.325
That is her!

50:16.497 --> 50:17.638
You'll eat
when I tell you to eat.

50:18.850 --> 50:20.683
You'll breathe
when I tell you to breathe.

50:27.859 --> 50:31.176
[♪]

50:31.270 --> 50:33.696
[janie] you see, right there,
he is controlling her movement.

50:34.940 --> 50:36.014
If you punch in--

50:36.034 --> 50:37.941
You can punch in
and maybe identify him?

50:38.094 --> 50:39.777
Can you blow it up?

50:39.871 --> 50:40.703
[detective] I'm just not
seeing an abduction here.

50:42.022 --> 50:43.039
It looks to me

50:43.266 --> 50:44.040
Like they're pretty familiar
with each other.

50:44.267 --> 50:45.449
Okay.

50:45.601 --> 50:46.876
But he's forcing her to move.

50:48.271 --> 50:49.937
She does not move like that.

50:49.955 --> 50:52.548
Or he's just embracing her
and trying to hold her up.

50:53.793 --> 50:55.051
No. Look again.

50:55.278 --> 50:56.201
Can you not find out
who that guy is?

50:56.295 --> 50:57.945
Look, I'm sorry,
mr. And mrs. Atkinson,

50:57.963 --> 50:59.129
I really am,

50:59.282 --> 51:00.723
But I'm just not seeing
what you're seeing.

51:02.802 --> 51:04.518
I have another appointment.

51:06.213 --> 51:07.396
We'll keep trying.

51:10.293 --> 51:11.233
Please.

51:19.819 --> 51:21.151
[richie] yeah, give me a--

51:21.304 --> 51:23.037
Give me an 8 ball and 20 grams.

51:27.476 --> 51:29.251
Gots a special on some rox.

51:29.403 --> 51:30.828
[richie] nah. Maybe--
maybe later.

51:30.980 --> 51:31.712
What about roofies?

51:33.073 --> 51:34.924
What's that for?

51:35.075 --> 51:36.241
[richie] what do you mean
what's that for?

51:36.260 --> 51:38.427
Come on.

51:38.579 --> 51:39.670
[dealer] you guys
have a good night.

51:39.822 --> 51:40.763
[richie] yeah, yeah.
I will.

51:40.990 --> 51:42.431
[dealer] let me know
if you need another.

51:44.677 --> 51:45.726
All right, man.

51:48.773 --> 51:51.565

51:55.004 --> 51:56.278

51:58.841 --> 52:00.341
-[man] sorry! Are you okay?
-[richie] I got you.

52:00.359 --> 52:01.117
No, no, no.
She'll be fine.

52:01.268 --> 52:02.359
-Come on.
-So sorry.

52:02.453 --> 52:03.694
No, we're fine.

52:03.788 --> 52:04.769
She'll be okay.

52:04.864 --> 52:06.530
She's fine. She's good.

52:06.682 --> 52:07.939
[grace] help me! Help me!

52:08.033 --> 52:08.940
Take her to the hospital.

52:09.034 --> 52:09.867
Yeah, yeah!
I got her.

52:09.961 --> 52:11.352
Sure you're okay?

52:11.370 --> 52:13.354
Yeah, yeah.
She'll be okay.

52:13.372 --> 52:14.705
Get back in the car.
Now. Now.

52:14.857 --> 52:17.782
No! Get off!

52:17.802 --> 52:18.876
Shut up!

52:19.028 --> 52:19.784
[sobs]

52:19.804 --> 52:20.803
Okay?

52:22.882 --> 52:24.473
[grace screams]

52:26.552 --> 52:27.626
Shut up, okay?
Shut up.

52:27.645 --> 52:28.644
Shut up.

52:29.814 --> 52:32.481
Please, please.
Richie, what do you want?

52:35.561 --> 52:37.486
My dad used to say

52:37.713 --> 52:39.655
That effort
was as important as trying.

52:41.400 --> 52:42.974
And you tried.
It was a good effort.

52:43.068 --> 52:44.142
-Okay?
-Don't do this.

52:44.162 --> 52:45.828
-Don't, please.
-And this is for you.

52:45.979 --> 52:46.996
-Please.
-This is your reward, okay?

52:50.893 --> 52:51.834
No...

52:55.339 --> 52:56.338
[gags]

53:03.406 --> 53:04.346

[grace wails]

53:13.599 --> 53:15.191
You asked everybody?
The entire staff?

53:15.342 --> 53:17.359
Everyone.
No one recognizes him.

53:19.755 --> 53:20.938
Mom, maybe the cop was right.

53:21.090 --> 53:22.364
-Maybe she--
-she's not using.

53:22.516 --> 53:23.924
But if she is,
that guy could be anyone.

53:23.943 --> 53:24.925
Her dealer,

53:25.018 --> 53:26.869
Some guy who found her
in her car

53:27.020 --> 53:28.037
When she was--

53:30.266 --> 53:31.782
Mom,

53:31.876 --> 53:33.024
I don't want to see you
go through this again.

53:33.044 --> 53:34.543
I love grace,

53:34.770 --> 53:35.694
But maybe we need
to learn to stop--

53:35.713 --> 53:36.545
Give me the key.

53:38.107 --> 53:39.364
-What?
-The key to her room.

53:39.383 --> 53:41.775
I should have searched it first.
Do you have the key?

53:41.794 --> 53:43.034
I already searched it.
There's nothing there.

53:43.054 --> 53:44.053
Give me the key.

Check out this note.

54:39.760 --> 54:41.110
-Isn't red the bartender here?
-She was.

54:41.261 --> 54:42.336
She's the one who helped
serve us the other day.

54:42.354 --> 54:43.353
Was?

54:43.447 --> 54:44.671
What do you mean?

54:44.690 --> 54:45.764
She hasn't been at work
the last few days.

54:45.858 --> 54:47.950
I've called,
I've messaged her--nothing.

54:50.529 --> 54:51.269
Right around
when grace disappeared.

54:51.289 --> 54:52.437
Honey...

54:52.531 --> 54:53.789
Is she friends with grace?

54:55.108 --> 54:56.775
Who's this--
who's this richie guy?

54:56.794 --> 54:57.609
She and grace
seemed pretty friendly.

54:57.703 --> 54:59.962
I have no clue who richie is.

55:00.189 --> 55:01.355
So maybe she does.
Do you have her address?

55:01.373 --> 55:02.298
Uh, yeah,

55:02.449 --> 55:03.690
It is probably
on her application--

55:03.709 --> 55:04.949
But, mom,

55:04.969 --> 55:06.302
You don't know

55:06.453 --> 55:07.711
If some guy named richie
is even the guy in the photo!

55:07.863 --> 55:09.638
Honey, I don't know anything,
but maybe red does.

55:09.865 --> 55:10.973
Come on.

55:12.459 --> 55:13.291
All right.
But I'm coming with you.

55:13.311 --> 55:14.310
Okay.

55:18.965 --> 55:20.649
[janie] that's what
we're looking for.

55:20.876 --> 55:22.776
-Right?
-Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

55:27.550 --> 55:28.549
This one.

55:28.567 --> 55:29.616
Red!

55:31.220 --> 55:32.386

55:32.404 --> 55:33.495
Please open up.

55:34.740 --> 55:35.889
Red, red! Please!

55:35.908 --> 55:36.981
Hey!

55:37.001 --> 55:39.560
Hey, knock it off.

55:39.578 --> 55:40.652
We need to talk
to the girl that lives here.

55:40.671 --> 55:42.913
Red. She's a bartender
at my restaurant.

55:43.065 --> 55:43.988
She hasn't shown up for days.

55:44.008 --> 55:45.841
We really need to talk to her.

55:46.068 --> 55:47.009
We need to talk to her
right now, please.

55:47.160 --> 55:48.844
Yeah, you and me both.

55:49.071 --> 55:51.254
She skipped out.
Owes me three months rent.

55:51.407 --> 55:52.514
If you find her, let me know.

55:54.093 --> 55:56.093
This is private property.

55:56.245 --> 55:57.019
Enough with the knocking.

56:02.585 --> 56:03.525
Mom...

56:09.942 --> 56:11.608
900. That's it.

56:11.760 --> 56:14.094
Derek squeezed me,
but we'll score on the next one.

56:14.187 --> 56:16.020
Grace will bring in the money.

56:16.040 --> 56:17.431
I'm out.

56:17.449 --> 56:18.265
What are you talking about?

56:18.283 --> 56:19.357
I'm done.

We've got a pipeline now.
We're makin' bank.

56:23.439 --> 56:25.029
Are you going soft on me?

56:25.049 --> 56:26.882
No. I'm salvaging my humanity.

56:27.033 --> 56:28.550
Grace is a nice girl,

56:28.777 --> 56:30.368
And she was trying
to get her life together.

56:37.136 --> 56:38.209
We cut derek out,

56:38.229 --> 56:39.377
That's all ours.

56:39.397 --> 56:41.230
Are you walking away on that?

56:43.142 --> 56:44.215
Yeah, you do you.

56:44.235 --> 56:45.401
My conscience isn't for sale.

58:48.192 --> 58:50.192
It's a contract.
You can't just change it.

Richie who?

1:00:53.392 --> 1:00:54.966

Look, I only know him
from the business, okay?

1:01:01.066 --> 1:01:02.807
What business?
Meaning what?

1:01:02.901 --> 1:01:04.067
He's a drug addict?

1:01:04.219 --> 1:01:05.402
No, no.

1:01:05.554 --> 1:01:07.053
He's mainly he's into roofies.

1:01:07.072 --> 1:01:08.071
What is it?

1:01:08.165 --> 1:01:10.407
You've never heard
of date-rape drugs?

1:01:10.559 --> 1:01:11.741
Guy uses them to grab girls.

1:01:11.835 --> 1:01:12.893
"grab girls"?

1:01:12.986 --> 1:01:14.318
I don't know what that means.

1:01:14.338 --> 1:01:16.654
-What does that mean?
-Lady! Come on!

1:01:16.674 --> 1:01:18.565
Date 'em. Rape 'em. Sell 'em.
Whatever.

1:01:18.583 --> 1:01:19.841
What? Sell 'em what?
Sell 'em drugs?

1:01:23.681 --> 1:01:24.513
Do you live in a bubble?

come back here again.

You're gonna believe
a drug dealer

1:01:49.373 --> 1:01:51.873
With a crazy story
about sex rings or whatever?

1:01:52.025 --> 1:01:52.874
He didn't mention...

1:01:53.026 --> 1:01:54.859
Sex rings!

1:01:54.878 --> 1:01:55.769
We were talking about richie.

1:01:57.456 --> 1:01:58.438
All right.

1:01:58.457 --> 1:01:59.439
He sells girls.
Is that it?

1:01:59.458 --> 1:02:00.698
That's what he says he does.

1:02:00.792 --> 1:02:02.033
-Yeah...
-That's what...

1:02:02.052 --> 1:02:03.126
-Okay.

1:02:03.220 --> 1:02:04.294
Janie. Honey.

1:02:04.446 --> 1:02:06.680
White middle-class girls
don't get sold.

1:02:08.116 --> 1:02:09.040
Okay, that only happens
to poor immigrants,

1:02:11.562 --> 1:02:12.543
And don't speak english.

1:02:12.563 --> 1:02:13.895
Not to girls like grace.

1:02:18.977 --> 1:02:20.902
Okay...

1:02:22.147 --> 1:02:24.072
It's the only lead we have.

1:02:27.578 --> 1:02:29.135
Jesus!

Honey, you're not seeing
the signs that are

1:02:30.973 --> 1:02:32.563
Right in front of your face!

1:02:32.583 --> 1:02:33.823
They're there!

1:02:33.976 --> 1:02:35.308
You're just not looking at it.

1:02:35.327 --> 1:02:37.494
You're not seeing the signs!

1:02:37.646 --> 1:02:38.569
Yeah, you're right, I'm not.

Everybody else!

1:02:41.333 --> 1:02:42.257
Oh, good!

1:02:42.484 --> 1:02:43.759
Then I'll just believe
everybody else

1:02:43.910 --> 1:02:44.926
And go along with them

1:02:45.078 --> 1:02:45.927
And just leave my daughter
in the gutter!

1:02:47.097 --> 1:02:48.054
That's not...

1:02:49.582 --> 1:02:51.007
I get it. I get it.

No, you don't,
no, you don't.

1:02:53.920 --> 1:02:55.345
She's relapsed.
Just admit it.

1:02:55.497 --> 1:02:57.330
Okay, let's go with that lie.

1:02:57.349 --> 1:03:00.517
Okay, then why haven't you
checked her credit card?

1:03:00.669 --> 1:03:01.759
Huh?

1:03:01.779 --> 1:03:03.837
You don't want to know--

1:03:03.930 --> 1:03:05.005
Because if it's
like last time,

1:03:05.023 --> 1:03:06.172
And she relapsed,

1:03:06.191 --> 1:03:08.617
The card'll be maxed, right?

1:03:10.120 --> 1:03:11.678
Right?

1:03:11.771 --> 1:03:13.288
-Yes.
-Tell me I'm wrong.

Then why haven't you
checked it?

1:03:15.517 --> 1:03:18.701
You don't talk to drug dealers
in a park.

1:10:18.381 --> 1:10:19.672
And where there's drugs,
there's trafficking.

1:10:21.109 --> 1:10:22.383
Vulnerable girls
are easy scores.

1:10:23.628 --> 1:10:24.777
They seduce them,

1:10:24.796 --> 1:10:26.387
They drug them,

1:10:26.539 --> 1:10:27.780
And they break them.

1:10:27.873 --> 1:10:30.541
After ten days,
they sell them--

1:10:30.560 --> 1:10:32.060
Some for internet sites.

1:10:32.287 --> 1:10:35.546
All those motels
up and down the interstate?

1:10:35.565 --> 1:10:38.641
Behind those doors,
it's all going down right now.

1:10:38.735 --> 1:10:40.126
They sell them?

1:10:40.144 --> 1:10:42.311
Ten days?

1:10:42.464 --> 1:10:43.646
Ten days...

1:10:43.798 --> 1:10:45.965
That's usually how long
it takes to break them.

1:10:45.984 --> 1:10:46.908
Ten days.

1:10:52.565 --> 1:10:54.249
How long
has your daughter been missing?

1:10:58.480 --> 1:10:59.921
Eight days.

1:11:07.430 --> 1:11:08.412
[rosa]<i> you don't know</i>
<i> this has happened to grace.</i>

1:11:08.431 --> 1:11:10.431
Okay?

1:11:10.583 --> 1:11:12.325
There could be
other explanations,

1:11:12.343 --> 1:11:14.994
But here's
some information

1:11:15.013 --> 1:11:16.437
That will help.

1:11:18.182 --> 1:11:20.275
If you need anything else,
come find me, okay?

1:11:30.120 --> 1:11:31.244
Janie...?

1:11:33.290 --> 1:11:34.289
What are you looking at?

1:11:36.534 --> 1:11:37.583
[janie] he's gonna sell her.

1:11:41.113 --> 1:11:42.297
He's gonna sell her.

1:11:46.361 --> 1:11:47.302
[janie sobs]

1:11:51.457 --> 1:11:52.807
Wasn't that
a nice warm shower, huh?

1:11:55.036 --> 1:11:56.311
You're all clean...

1:11:58.481 --> 1:11:59.605
...And fresh.

1:12:02.043 --> 1:12:03.109
You know...

1:12:04.804 --> 1:12:06.946
I'm gonna miss you.

1:12:08.399 --> 1:12:09.615
I'm gonna miss you so much.

1:12:12.236 --> 1:12:13.494
But it's showtime, angel.

1:12:15.740 --> 1:12:17.073

L'rayne.
What's up?

1:15:09.230 --> 1:15:11.321
So, you've been here
over a week.

1:15:11.415 --> 1:15:12.414
That's what's up.

1:15:12.509 --> 1:15:14.900
And now you've rented
two more rooms.

1:15:14.919 --> 1:15:16.418
Yeah, you know
I'm good for it, okay?

1:15:16.513 --> 1:15:17.595
Pay or you're out.

1:15:19.832 --> 1:15:21.182
Look, the ship

1:15:21.409 --> 1:15:23.184
And then you're gonna get
your money, okay?

1:15:23.411 --> 1:15:24.519
Whatever.

1:15:24.670 --> 1:15:25.770
You have until tomorrow

1:15:27.598 --> 1:15:28.672
-Okay.
-You think it's funny?

1:15:28.766 --> 1:15:29.815
I gotta go,
I gotta go.

1:15:31.361 --> 1:15:32.318
You can't park there.

1:15:41.538 --> 1:15:42.853
[janie] this is where
the car was parked.

1:15:42.872 --> 1:15:44.372
Okay.

1:15:44.523 --> 1:15:46.374
These are all of the places
where I've handed out fliers.

1:15:46.601 --> 1:15:47.767
Okay, what are
the green circles?

1:15:47.860 --> 1:15:49.693
They're the motels
near the highway.

1:15:49.787 --> 1:15:51.379
-Those are the motels?
-Yeah.

1:15:51.530 --> 1:15:52.213
There's gotta be
at least 50 of them!

1:15:52.440 --> 1:15:53.455
No kidding.

1:15:53.550 --> 1:15:55.532
She could be anywhere.

1:15:55.626 --> 1:15:56.292
Okay, we've got to narrow
the search.

1:15:56.386 --> 1:15:58.127
So...

1:15:58.279 --> 1:15:59.128
Okay, I'll tell you what.

1:15:59.280 --> 1:16:00.963
I'll take this area here.

1:16:01.115 --> 1:16:02.615
We'll get rex

1:16:02.708 --> 1:16:03.632
Honey, can you do swedesboro?

1:16:03.726 --> 1:16:04.800
Yeah.

1:16:04.952 --> 1:16:05.876
Okay, then you can do--

1:16:05.970 --> 1:16:07.377
-Receipts!
-What?

1:16:07.471 --> 1:16:08.304
The credit card statements.

1:16:08.398 --> 1:16:09.397
Why didn't we look at

1:16:09.548 --> 1:16:11.290
The addresses
of her last purchases?

1:16:11.383 --> 1:16:12.066
Of course.
How could we miss that?

1:16:14.645 --> 1:16:15.736
Okay...

1:16:17.982 --> 1:16:19.056
There was a charge--

1:16:19.150 --> 1:16:20.908
A drug store on elm street.

1:16:21.060 --> 1:16:21.984
Alden street.

1:16:22.078 --> 1:16:23.578
And...

1:16:23.729 --> 1:16:25.154
She made a charge
at a big box on...

1:16:25.248 --> 1:16:26.414
Storey avenue.

1:16:26.641 --> 1:16:28.165
Okay, pull up those on a map
so I can match it.

1:16:29.994 --> 1:16:30.751
Okay, alden street.

1:16:30.903 --> 1:16:32.736

1:16:40.930 --> 1:16:41.912
Honey, take those.

1:16:42.006 --> 1:16:42.763

1:16:44.175 --> 1:16:45.349

1:25:09.754 --> 1:25:12.164
<i> We could just put this</i>
