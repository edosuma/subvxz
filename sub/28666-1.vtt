Ma, please,
this job is too hard for me to do.

-Too hard?

20:02.463 --> 20:03.755

you knew what you were coming to do.

20:05.755 --> 20:08.422
-I didn't know.
-Don't tell me you don't know what to do.

You wanted to come to Europe.
Now you are in Europe.

20:11.672 --> 20:14.088
So you have to work and give me my money.

20:14.713 --> 20:16.213

[in English]
You are owing me 60,000 euros.

20:23.630 --> 20:27.713
That's why I said I can do another job,
not this job. Any job but this one.

20:27.797 --> 20:29.797
Madame, I beg you.

20:30.422 --> 20:34.047

try your best,

you are going to pay the money.

20:39.755 --> 20:41.630
-But why?
-Why?

20:42.172 --> 20:45.672
You don't know? I gave you
the responsibility to take care of her.

20:45.963 --> 20:47.922

26:43.880 --> 26:44.963

26:45.630 --> 26:47.922
You have to pull yourself together 
and get used to it

26:48.005 --> 26:49.297
because you have to pay your money.

26:49.380 --> 26:51.338
I cannot be paying for myself

26:51.588 --> 26:53.213
This is serious. This is not a joke.

-You don't even know them.
-We don't look at the faces.

Don't look at the faces.
You look at the money.

27:11.422 --> 27:12.422
You target your goal.

27:12.963 --> 27:14.755
You concentrate on what you want to get.

27:15.380 --> 27:17.005
This is why you need to start working now.

27:17.088 --> 27:18.338
So that you have the experience.

27:18.797 --> 27:21.422
You know how
to manipulate these men to get the money.

27:21.797 --> 27:24.463
And if you're lucky, you might even
get someone who's nice to you

27:24.547 --> 27:26.963

before you know it.

27:47.130 --> 27:48.088
Don't thank me.

27:49.047 --> 27:51.463
Because from now on,
I can't defend you anymore.

27:51.880 --> 27:53.755
You have to start paying your money
by yourself.

27:54.380 --> 27:55.797
And I'll give you a piece of advice.

27:56.005 --> 27:58.630
In this game,
it's the survival of the fittest.

27:59.172 --> 28:02.047
That means if I have to kill you
to pay off my debts, I will.

28:02.880 --> 28:04.963
If I have to steal from you,
I will do that.

28:05.630 --> 28:07.797
And I don't trust you,
so don't trust me either.

28:08.422 --> 28:09.463
Only trust yourself.

I'll give you something.

[Precious] Little kids wouldn't even make
a mess like this.

42:17.338 --> 42:19.255
[woman 2 in English]
Watch what you do, Precious.

42:19.380 --> 42:20.963
[Precious] What kind of thing is this?

42:21.130 --> 42:23.047
[Precious speaking in Pidgin]

42:26.422 --> 42:27.630
[Precious in English] Move your leg.

42:28.255 --> 42:30.672
-[woman] Don't sweep my leg.
-[Precious] Move your leg now!

42:33.797 --> 42:36.505
[door opens and closes]

42:42.797 --> 42:44.797
-Madame, good morning.
-[Madame] Good morning.

42:46.922 --> 42:49.213
This way you are dressing,
where are you going?

42:51.588 --> 42:54.505
I want to get some things
from the shop... some food stuff.

42:58.213 --> 42:59.797
[Madame] With your hair and everything?

43:00.630 --> 43:03.380
You need to be so beautiful
to go to the supermarket

43:03.630 --> 43:04.922
just to buy things?

43:07.213 --> 43:09.547
Are you sure you're not going
to your boyfriend's place?

43:09.963 --> 43:11.880
-[Joy] Madame, I don't have a boyfriend.
-Morning.

43:12.005 --> 43:12.922
[Madame] Good morning.

43:13.713 --> 43:16.338
Auntie Joy, remember to buy toilet paper.

43:16.422 --> 43:17.588
We're almost out.

43:18.213 --> 43:20.672
That green one, don't buy the blue one.

43:20.797 --> 43:22.463
-The green one is very soft.
-[Joy] Okay.

43:22.630 --> 43:26.047
What's the name of that thing again?
I forgot the name.

43:26.380 --> 43:28.588
-It makes the bathroom whiter.
-Okay.

43:28.922 --> 43:30.838
[Precious] The thing that
cleans the bathroom.

43:30.963 --> 43:33.130
That's finished too, please buy some.
Don't forget.

43:33.213 --> 43:35.755
Please buy it.
Last time I told her, she didn't buy it.

43:35.880 --> 43:36.713
Okay.

43:44.838 --> 43:46.297
[Madame] What about the other girls?

43:46.922 --> 43:48.963
[Precious] It's still morning.
They're still sleeping.

43:51.755 --> 43:54.130
[in English] If someone 
speaks against the madame,

43:54.213 --> 43:55.797
if someone speaks against her madame,

43:56.005 --> 43:57.172
not me, like a friend,

43:57.713 --> 44:00.880
so is there any guarantee that
at the end of the procedure

44:00.963 --> 44:02.880
that something positive is
going to happen?

44:02.963 --> 44:04.797
Like, maybe she will get, like, a…

44:05.088 --> 44:08.880
a working permit or a visa,
you know, a permit to stay here.

44:09.047 --> 44:11.088
What's… Is there any guarantee…

44:11.838 --> 44:12.672
for this?

44:13.672 --> 44:15.838
Unfortunately, there is no guarantee.

44:16.255 --> 44:18.005
Not 100% guarantee,

44:18.172 --> 44:23.088
but there is the possibility to try
to achieve...

44:24.213 --> 44:25.213
that you can stay,

44:25.297 --> 44:28.088
that the person that sues a madame

44:28.172 --> 44:30.338
can stay and can remake her life here.

44:30.422 --> 44:33.088
Why should someone make a sacrifice
for other people?

44:33.172 --> 44:38.213
Because me speaking out, it’s to stop it
from happening to other girls.

44:38.755 --> 44:40.047
Then what happens to me?

44:40.297 --> 44:42.672
Then I should get sacrificed
for someone else?

44:43.005 --> 44:43.838
Is that the point?

44:43.963 --> 44:46.463
One person has to sacrifice
for the other people or what?

44:46.755 --> 44:48.963
[woman] Yes, this stays a dilemma, 
that’s true.<i></i>

44:49.255 --> 44:51.547
And, you know,
you don’t have so many options.

44:51.922 --> 44:54.963
That’s part of the problem,
you’ve got asylum negative.

44:55.047 --> 44:58.922
Yes, but… my question,
the main point now is...

44:59.880 --> 45:05.213
if the government doesn’t grant
this person a visa or a permit to stay,

45:05.338 --> 45:07.713
or a working permit,
and if this person cannot stay

45:07.797 --> 45:09.130
and has to go back to Nigeria, 

45:09.338 --> 45:12.172
so what's the point of going through
all this risk?

45:12.255 --> 45:14.380
What's the gain, what's the point?

45:15.088 --> 45:17.297
Because you still have to
go back to Nigeria anyway

45:17.505 --> 45:20.005
and your family are in a big danger.

45:20.255 --> 45:21.630
You are in danger.

45:21.713 --> 45:24.255
They know your house,
they know everything about you.

45:24.672 --> 45:26.630
The family are there,
your family is there,

45:26.755 --> 45:28.713
the madame's people are there,
everyone is there, 

45:28.797 --> 45:30.130
and the juju priest is there.

45:30.338 --> 45:33.630
Everything is still going to work 
against you, so tell me what's the point?

45:35.672 --> 45:37.880
[man in German] Juju, what does that mean?

45:38.755 --> 45:39.672
Juju?

45:41.297 --> 45:46.338
[in German] 
Juju is widely practiced in Nigeria.

45:46.505 --> 45:51.297
It's a religious practice that is
unfortunately abused by some priests.

45:52.005 --> 45:55.255
Women are taken there
to swear an oath.

45:55.755 --> 46:00.838
In the oath, they say,
"Okay, if you take me to Europe,

46:01.088 --> 46:05.380
I'll pay back the money for the journey
and never collaborate with the police."

46:06.088 --> 46:10.422
The juju priest usually keeps a bag

46:10.963 --> 46:13.922
with personal concerns
of the woman who swore the oath,

46:14.005 --> 46:16.088
or a photo,
which he keeps with him.

46:16.880 --> 46:20.338
As long as she's not paid it off,
she's bound to the oath.

46:20.505 --> 46:22.755
This has huge consequences
for the women,

46:23.088 --> 46:26.755
because many believe so strongly in it
that it can break them.

46:30.922 --> 46:34.463
[children chattering]

48:06.630 --> 48:08.547
[car approaching]

48:15.547 --> 48:16.922
[car accelerating]

48:22.963 --> 48:24.547
[muffled speech through receiver]

48:25.005 --> 48:27.047
[in English]
You know the way this job is hard.

48:27.130 --> 48:29.797
You know how hard this job is,
that's what I'm trying to do.

48:30.005 --> 48:31.672
I still do the job. I'm trying my best.

48:31.755 --> 48:34.338
What do you expect?
I don't work in a bank.

48:34.922 --> 48:36.755
How do you expect me to have
that kind of money?

48:38.922 --> 48:41.172
[Precious continues phone conversation
in nearby cubicle]

48:43.588 --> 48:44.630
[in English] What happened?

48:45.422 --> 48:48.463
[Precious continues phone conversation]

48:54.672 --> 48:55.505
Okay.

48:58.088 --> 49:01.797
[Precious speaking in exasperation]

49:02.797 --> 49:03.672
To the hospital!

49:05.547 --> 49:08.005
[Precious] My mate is what?
My mate is what?

49:08.422 --> 49:13.297
My mates pay their own money.
Go on, ask them for it.

49:13.380 --> 49:14.547
What do you want me to do now?

49:14.630 --> 49:17.672
I'm working hard here.
I have to pay Madame the money.

49:17.880 --> 49:19.422
Okay, I will try and send you...

49:19.797 --> 49:21.588
I mean, five million naira 
is a lot of money.

49:21.672 --> 49:23.088
I don't have that kind of money now.

49:23.213 --> 49:25.213
But I will try and send you
what I have now.

49:26.088 --> 49:27.963
So you can start the treatment
immediately.

49:28.047 --> 49:30.338
I don't want him to go through any stress,
any suffering.

49:30.422 --> 49:32.588
I don't want him to suffer more than
he is doing already.

49:33.672 --> 49:34.505
I mean...

49:37.213 --> 49:39.547
[Precious continues to speak]

49:43.338 --> 49:46.047
So without the money,
they cannot commence the treatments?

49:46.130 --> 49:48.630
[Precious continues to speak]

49:49.755 --> 49:50.630
Okay, I'll--

49:51.130 --> 49:52.547
Okay, I will send you what I have,

49:52.630 --> 49:54.672
so they can start treating him
immediately.

49:55.963 --> 49:59.463
I don't know how I will get the rest,
but, yeah, I will try.

49:59.588 --> 50:02.047
I don't know. I have no idea
how I'll come up with the rest,

50:02.130 --> 50:04.797
but I will just bring what I have now.
And...

50:05.672 --> 50:07.088
You start and then I will...

50:07.630 --> 50:10.463
[sighs]
think of how to come up with the rest.

50:19.547 --> 50:22.130
[Precious grumbles]

50:23.797 --> 50:25.797
I don't know what is wrong
with these people.

50:26.838 --> 50:28.422
Neighbor's daughter brought money,

50:28.713 --> 50:30.755
bought a car, bought everything.
I don't know.

50:31.047 --> 50:33.422
I don't know what they expect me to do,
to go and sell myself.

50:34.297 --> 50:37.422
As if I came to Europe to buy a car...
[sucks teeth]

50:47.505 --> 50:50.588
She even said that this job is not hard.

50:50.797 --> 50:55.172
I should sleep with more men,
like the other girls are doing.

50:55.463 --> 50:57.505
I tell her it's a horrible job.

50:57.588 --> 51:00.130
She says, "It's not that hard," and...

51:00.213 --> 51:01.755
-[woman in German] Send 600 euros?
-Yes.

51:01.963 --> 51:05.255
[in English] "It's not that hard to sleep
with someone you don't love."

51:05.338 --> 51:07.338
My own mother,
who gave birth to me.

51:07.880 --> 51:10.130
She asked me for too much money.

51:11.838 --> 51:12.797
Everything okay?

51:15.172 --> 51:16.672
Everything's okay? You're alright?

51:17.172 --> 51:18.255
No problem. It's fine.

51:20.463 --> 51:21.380
Are you sure?

51:28.047 --> 51:30.547
-[in German] Found something?
-[in English] Yes.

51:31.463 --> 51:33.963
Pepper beef. From the last time.

51:34.672 --> 51:37.422
-[in German] May I take your order?
-[in German] Pepper beef, please.

51:37.547 --> 51:39.797
Okay. With rice? Yes.

51:40.213 --> 51:41.838
-And you, sir?
-<i>Bulgogi.</i>

51:41.963 --> 51:43.838
Sure. Something to drink?

51:43.922 --> 51:46.297
-Two glasses of red wine, please.
-Sure.

51:46.380 --> 51:47.880
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

51:55.213 --> 51:56.338
A little surprise for you.

51:57.922 --> 51:58.880
Open it.

52:01.963 --> 52:02.797
Ooh!

52:04.422 --> 52:05.255
Wow!

52:08.172 --> 52:09.255
You can pay off your debt.

52:10.338 --> 52:14.547
You won't have to do it
with different men all the time.

52:15.838 --> 52:18.463
I have a great idea.
We rent an apartment...

52:20.463 --> 52:21.297
Excuse me.

52:22.922 --> 52:24.797
-[waiter] There you go.
-Thank you.

52:27.797 --> 52:29.380
[man] You live there with your daughter.

52:29.463 --> 52:33.463
You'll never want for anything.
I'll shop for you.

52:34.422 --> 52:36.588
No one will know where it is.

52:37.172 --> 52:38.588
So the madame can't find you.

52:39.505 --> 52:42.380
Neither the authorities nor anyone else.

52:48.380 --> 52:50.838
[in English] Wow, this is 
really generous of you.

52:51.047 --> 52:52.797
I mean, I didn't expect it.

52:53.838 --> 52:54.838
Thank you very much.

52:57.755 --> 52:58.713
[sighs]

52:59.588 --> 53:00.422
Yeah...

53:03.213 --> 53:04.047
But I...

53:04.297 --> 53:06.630
I will have to send this money to Nigeria

53:07.213 --> 53:09.213
because my father is really sick.

53:09.380 --> 53:10.755
[in German] What's wrong with him?

53:10.963 --> 53:12.755
[in English] Yeah. They called me.

53:13.130 --> 53:15.005
He is sick and he is in the hospital,

53:15.088 --> 53:17.422
and I need a lot of money
for his treatment,

53:17.505 --> 53:20.797
but this is...
This really came at the right time,

53:20.880 --> 53:22.463
because it is going to help a lot.

53:22.755 --> 53:24.547
And I have to support him.

53:25.505 --> 53:28.422
He needs to do a kidney transplant.

53:28.713 --> 53:33.130
[in German] The money is so we can 
live together, it's for...

53:33.338 --> 53:34.297
our future.

53:34.672 --> 53:36.338
[in English] Yes, I know. But, you know,

53:36.547 --> 53:40.505
this started to happen
after I went to the NGO, you know?

53:40.755 --> 53:44.338
And I think it's, like, a punishment
from the juju or, like, a warning,

53:44.797 --> 53:48.922
so I cannot let him die, you know.
I have to do something.

53:49.005 --> 53:50.755
[in German] 
That's ridiculous, it's nonsense.

53:51.047 --> 53:53.463
-[in English] Yes, the juju--
-[in German] He has a photo of you.

53:53.630 --> 53:56.338
-[in English] This is not a joke.
-[in German] He has your photo and money.

53:56.463 --> 53:57.797
That's all he cares about.

53:57.963 --> 53:59.463
[in English] This is not a joke.

53:59.797 --> 54:00.672
I'm serious.

54:01.838 --> 54:03.963
I came from there and I know what it is.

54:04.505 --> 54:06.422
-It's serious.
-[in German] If he is sick,

54:06.505 --> 54:07.547
it's just a coincidence.

54:08.255 --> 54:09.963
[in English] It's not a joke, okay?

54:10.047 --> 54:12.422
He's sick because of me,
and it's because of the voodoo.

54:12.588 --> 54:14.380
[in German] I don't believe it.

54:14.922 --> 54:18.297
You'll send it to your family,
or you might even keep it.

54:19.213 --> 54:21.963
[in English] He's really sick,
and this is a warning.

54:22.130 --> 54:24.963
You know, like a punishment.
-[in German] No...

54:25.213 --> 54:26.672
[in English] I have to do something.

54:26.755 --> 54:29.255
I cannot have this kind of money
and my father is dying.

54:29.463 --> 54:30.672
[in German] This is pointless.

54:31.297 --> 54:33.172
It's always about sending money.

54:33.422 --> 54:35.297
And now this story again.

54:35.922 --> 54:37.422
These are all stories.

54:38.047 --> 54:39.255
No, give me back the money.

54:41.213 --> 54:43.547
This is over. We won't meet again.

54:48.088 --> 54:50.922
[in English] My family comes first, 
you know. They are my priority

54:51.005 --> 54:52.547
and I’m here because of them.

54:52.630 --> 54:54.380
I do everything I'm doing
because of them.

54:54.463 --> 54:56.172
I’m struggling for them, you know.

54:56.505 --> 55:00.047
So I… You have your own family. 

55:00.755 --> 55:01.588
You cannot leave.

55:01.672 --> 55:04.255
Are you going to leave your wife
and your kids for me?

55:09.213 --> 55:10.505
[in German] It's best to end it.

55:11.172 --> 55:12.797
-[in English] Seriously?
-[in German] Yeah.

55:13.630 --> 55:14.880
I don't trust you anymore.

55:18.047 --> 55:19.672
I'm not sure what you do with the money.

55:20.338 --> 55:21.547
Maybe it's all an act.

55:23.880 --> 55:25.672
And you tell me your dad is sick.

55:28.463 --> 55:30.630
Let's end it. This is pointless.

55:30.880 --> 55:32.797
-[in English] Are you serious?
-[in German] Yes.

55:33.172 --> 55:34.130
[in English] Okay.

56:12.922 --> 56:15.213
[car approaching]

56:41.213 --> 56:42.630
[car approaching]

57:00.880 --> 57:02.130
[Joy in English] Here is okay.

57:02.505 --> 57:05.380
[in German] No, I know a good spot for us.

57:17.588 --> 57:19.005
[in English] Why are you driving 
so far away?

57:19.088 --> 57:20.838
I have to walk a lot
when I'm coming back.

57:20.922 --> 57:23.463
[man in English] I'll bring you back. 
Don't worry.

57:41.588 --> 57:43.755
Okay, you know what, stop, let me out.

57:44.880 --> 57:45.838
I want to go out.

57:45.922 --> 57:47.005
Please stop the car.

57:48.172 --> 57:49.130
Let me out.

57:55.005 --> 57:57.463
Please, stop the car. I want to go out.

58:00.213 --> 58:02.713
Can you please stop the car?
I want to go out.

58:18.338 --> 58:19.172
[car door opens]

58:32.672 --> 58:33.505
[Precious] Joy!

58:45.963 --> 58:47.005
[in German] What happened?

58:47.297 --> 58:48.463
Should I call an ambulance?

58:48.630 --> 58:50.963
-[in English] No, it's okay.
-No? Okay?

58:52.588 --> 58:54.505
[Joy hisses in pain]

59:17.672 --> 59:18.588
[man] Take two.

59:53.630 --> 59:55.713
[in English] Don't worry. 
You're going to be fine.

59:56.380 --> 59:57.922
I know you are a strong girl.

59:59.630 --> 1:00:01.547
And I know the pains
you are going through.

1:00:04.255 --> 1:00:07.213
You will be okay.
In a few days' time, you will be okay.

1:00:09.630 --> 1:00:12.463
The bleeding also will stop
and everything will stop.

1:00:13.297 --> 1:00:14.130
Okay?

1:00:15.213 --> 1:00:18.297
That's not helping anything.
The tablets are not helping anything.

1:00:18.380 --> 1:00:20.797
They're painkillers,
they don't stop the bleeding.

1:00:21.130 --> 1:00:22.130
She's bleeding!

1:00:22.255 --> 1:00:24.963
We need to take her to the hospital.

1:00:25.172 --> 1:00:28.130
You have so many connections,
just call someone who studied medicine.

1:00:28.213 --> 1:00:29.713
-because she's bleeding.
-No.

1:00:30.088 --> 1:00:31.755
She cannot go to hospital.

1:00:32.172 --> 1:00:35.380
But the pills aren't stopping
the bleeding.

1:00:35.463 --> 1:00:36.505
They're not magic.

1:00:36.755 --> 1:00:38.297
-Call a doctor or something.
-Precious...

1:00:38.380 --> 1:00:40.963
Precious, she doesn't have a visa.

1:00:42.630 --> 1:00:43.838
They can deport her.

1:00:45.047 --> 1:00:46.755
Do you want her to be deported?

1:00:48.963 --> 1:00:51.588
Or do you think I'm happy
seeing her suffering like this?

1:00:52.922 --> 1:00:55.130
It's only a question of time.

1:00:57.005 --> 1:00:59.922
Do you know how many times
they raped me in my own time?

1:01:00.047 --> 1:01:02.588
They even stabbed me with a knife
to my stomach.

1:01:03.338 --> 1:01:05.672
All of you know what you came here to do.

1:01:06.172 --> 1:01:08.088
In my own time, we didn't know it.

1:01:09.088 --> 1:01:11.338
They just told us,
"You'll work as cleaners."

1:01:11.880 --> 1:01:13.963
This is how the job is in Europe.

1:01:15.547 --> 1:01:19.130
She will survive it. 
Joy, you are a strong girl.

1:01:19.838 --> 1:01:22.422
And if it is because of
your father's treatment...

1:01:23.963 --> 1:01:25.297
I will give you the money.

1:01:27.088 --> 1:01:27.922
Thank you, Ma.

1:01:30.130 --> 1:01:31.380
[Madame] It's not a gift.

1:01:31.713 --> 1:01:32.755
This is business.

1:01:33.755 --> 1:01:35.963
You will give me back with interest

1:01:36.547 --> 1:01:38.338
when you start working, okay?

1:01:39.297 --> 1:01:40.130
Okay.

1:01:54.797 --> 1:01:56.380
[door opens]

1:02:07.755 --> 1:02:09.255
[Joy] Welcome, Madame.

1:02:12.588 --> 1:02:13.463
[Madame] Precious!

1:02:14.297 --> 1:02:15.672
-Ma?
-[Madame] Come, please.

1:02:16.630 --> 1:02:17.630
[Joy] How was your trip?

1:02:17.963 --> 1:02:19.255
[Madame] Everybody is fine.

1:02:20.130 --> 1:02:21.547
[Joy] Did you bring anything for us?

1:02:21.838 --> 1:02:23.380
[Madame] I bring good health.

1:02:25.963 --> 1:02:27.630
-I saw your family.
-[Precious] Welcome back, Ma.

1:02:28.922 --> 1:02:31.880
Please go. Go and buy some foodstuffs.

1:02:32.422 --> 1:02:33.255
Where?

1:02:33.672 --> 1:02:35.755
[Madame]
You know what is not in the house here.

1:02:37.380 --> 1:02:39.172
Foodstuff. Buy some foodstuff.

1:02:39.588 --> 1:02:40.755
-Okay.
-[Madame] Bye.

1:02:40.922 --> 1:02:41.880
How are your family?

1:02:42.338 --> 1:02:43.630
They are all doing fine.

1:02:43.880 --> 1:02:45.338
You know, I saw your family.

1:02:46.588 --> 1:02:47.630
They are very fine,

1:02:47.797 --> 1:02:48.755
even your father.

1:02:49.380 --> 1:02:52.172
-I saw your brother with a brand new car.
-My brother?

1:02:52.255 --> 1:02:54.130
-Flashy car.
-With a car?

1:02:56.672 --> 1:02:58.713
They have a rich daughter in Europe.

1:02:58.922 --> 1:03:00.630
[floorboards creak]

1:03:04.005 --> 1:03:05.213
[door closes]

1:03:06.672 --> 1:03:08.672
I want you to do something for me,
please.

1:03:10.463 --> 1:03:13.755
Tomorrow, you will take Precious
to this place.

1:03:13.922 --> 1:03:14.797
Where is this?

1:03:16.922 --> 1:03:20.380
As soon as you reach this train station,
you call this number.

1:03:22.713 --> 1:03:24.213
Then what happens to Precious?

1:03:25.255 --> 1:03:26.672
The man knows everything.

1:03:28.797 --> 1:03:30.297
Here is the passport also.

1:03:30.963 --> 1:03:32.255
So what happens to her?

1:03:33.005 --> 1:03:34.838
She will start working in Italy now.

1:03:38.088 --> 1:03:39.755
If you do your job well,

1:03:40.005 --> 1:03:41.463
[in Pidgin] I will reduce your debt.

1:03:43.130 --> 1:03:44.713
-[in English] Okay, Ma.
-Okay.

1:03:50.963 --> 1:03:56.005
[in Pidgin] When you're there,
you have to learn to keep quiet.

1:03:56.630 --> 1:03:57.797
Mind your own business.

1:03:58.922 --> 1:04:01.588
[Joy in English] Come on, girls.
The place is not as bad as you think.

1:04:01.672 --> 1:04:03.547
-People are living there.
-[woman] You've not been there.

1:04:03.713 --> 1:04:05.380
[Joy] I know, but people are living there.

1:04:05.505 --> 1:04:06.463
You should encourage her

1:04:06.547 --> 1:04:08.797
-and not, you know...
-[woman] Precious, no worries, yeah?

1:04:09.463 --> 1:04:12.047
[in Pidgin] When you're free,
you can still come and see us.

1:04:12.130 --> 1:04:15.422
Free? She'll be 30 when she's free.

1:04:15.505 --> 1:04:17.672
It won't take long until you're free.

1:04:17.755 --> 1:04:19.630
[in English] Come on, be encouraging.

1:04:19.713 --> 1:04:21.130
[in Pidgin] Sorry.

1:04:22.713 --> 1:04:23.547
Precious...

1:04:23.713 --> 1:04:25.255
Hurry up now.

1:04:25.588 --> 1:04:28.255
[in English] How long will it take you
to put your things together?

1:04:30.297 --> 1:04:31.797
Please hurry up, let's go.

1:04:36.838 --> 1:04:39.380
[woman] Precious, don't worry,
everything will be fine, okay?

1:04:39.588 --> 1:04:41.672
[in Pidgin] Let me hold my Precious 
before she goes.

1:04:42.172 --> 1:04:43.672
[in English] Everything will be fine.

1:04:45.588 --> 1:04:46.630
I will miss you.

1:04:47.338 --> 1:04:50.463
You don't want to hug me
because I tell you the truth. Eh?

1:04:50.547 --> 1:04:52.505
[in Pidgin]
You'll see that it's like I said.

1:04:54.005 --> 1:04:54.880
No worries, you hear?

1:04:55.797 --> 1:04:58.922
Everything will be fine.
Try and respect the people.

1:05:00.547 --> 1:05:01.797
Our little baby.

1:05:02.838 --> 1:05:04.963
[in English] Safe journey, yeah?
Take care.

1:05:05.297 --> 1:05:07.880
[in Pidgin] See, don't talk too much.

1:05:08.088 --> 1:05:10.630
[in English] Let's go, let's go, please.
Let's go.

1:05:10.755 --> 1:05:12.797
-Take care of yourself.
-Take care.

1:05:12.922 --> 1:05:13.755
-Bye.
-Bye.

1:05:46.672 --> 1:05:48.797
[man in German]
Any new passengers, please?

1:05:49.463 --> 1:05:52.005
Hello. Any new passengers?

1:05:52.838 --> 1:05:56.505
Hello. Your tickets, please.

1:06:04.130 --> 1:06:06.880
[man] Destination Lienz. Two passengers.

1:06:07.505 --> 1:06:10.005
Thank you. Have a pleasant trip.

1:06:29.005 --> 1:06:30.422
[door slides open]

1:06:30.838 --> 1:06:33.463
[policeman 1] Good afternoon.
Police, ID control.

1:06:33.672 --> 1:06:35.380
[policeman 2]
Show me your passport, please.

1:06:35.672 --> 1:06:36.838
[policeman 1] Passport or ID.

1:06:37.463 --> 1:06:38.922
ID card, passport?

1:06:42.297 --> 1:06:45.130
[policemen continue to speak to passenger]

1:06:58.963 --> 1:07:00.880
[policemen speaking outside]

1:07:13.588 --> 1:07:16.880
[train information announcement in German]

1:07:30.172 --> 1:07:32.963
[announcement on PA]
<i>Please pay attention to station</i>

1:07:33.047 --> 1:07:35.297
<i>announcements and departure boards.</i>

1:07:36.213 --> 1:07:39.005
<i>Thank you for traveling with us.</i>

1:07:39.297 --> 1:07:40.255
<i>Goodbye.</i>

1:07:47.422 --> 1:07:48.338
Hello.

1:07:50.338 --> 1:07:51.172
Hello.

1:07:53.005 --> 1:07:54.797
[in English] Yeah, we missed the train.

1:07:55.380 --> 1:07:56.422
Um...

1:07:57.213 --> 1:08:00.630
We had to get out
because there was a police control.

1:08:02.755 --> 1:08:06.005
-[man on phone] <i>Where are you right now?</i>
-We are in Salzburg, in Bad Gastein.

1:08:07.588 --> 1:08:08.463
[man] <i>Bad Gastein?</i>

1:08:09.213 --> 1:08:12.880
-Should I take the next train and come?
-[man] <i>No! You stay where you are.</i>

1:08:13.463 --> 1:08:15.713
<i>Stay where you are,</i>
<i>and I'll come and pick you up.</i>

1:08:17.047 --> 1:08:18.338
Okay. We'll wait here.

1:08:19.255 --> 1:08:21.130
Yes, we'll wait. Okay.

1:08:22.380 --> 1:08:23.588
Okay, thank you. Bye.

1:08:29.047 --> 1:08:30.213
Carry your bag. Let's go.

1:09:01.838 --> 1:09:02.922
Can I just go?

1:09:03.547 --> 1:09:05.255
Can you give me my passport
and I'll just go?

1:09:05.338 --> 1:09:06.630
Madame will think I ran away.

1:09:07.630 --> 1:09:09.630
Which passport?
And where are you going to?

1:09:10.338 --> 1:09:12.880
She'll think that I ran away,
tell her that the police got me.

1:09:12.963 --> 1:09:15.213
She'll believe you,
the police almost got us now.

1:09:16.005 --> 1:09:18.547
Do you think that Madame
would believe the police got you?

1:09:18.755 --> 1:09:21.297
And do you think it makes any sense
or any difference to her?

1:09:21.588 --> 1:09:23.297
If I let you go,
I'm going to pay your debts.

1:09:23.880 --> 1:09:25.172
And why should I do that?

1:09:26.463 --> 1:09:29.797
Do you think it's fair? For you to even
think about it and talk about it,

1:09:29.880 --> 1:09:30.713
it's so unfair.

1:09:31.088 --> 1:09:33.047
So I should carry your cross for you
and let you go

1:09:33.130 --> 1:09:35.880
and start to pay your own debts
when I'm almost done with mine, right?

1:09:49.630 --> 1:09:52.630
If both of us run away,
you don't have to pay my money.

1:09:53.047 --> 1:09:57.047
She'll believe the police caught
both of us.

1:09:57.505 --> 1:09:59.463
I'm not part of it.
I'm not going anywhere.

1:09:59.547 --> 1:10:02.588
Besides, I have already paid my own.
I have almost paid mine.

1:10:02.713 --> 1:10:07.005
[Precious] How long until you've
finished paying? Seven, ten years?

1:10:07.088 --> 1:10:09.172
I'm almost done
and  I'll finish it very soon.

1:10:09.338 --> 1:10:10.880
And you have not even started.

1:10:11.088 --> 1:10:13.005
Okay? So we are not in the same shoes.

1:10:14.547 --> 1:10:16.630
If I run away with you,
what happens to my daughter?

1:10:18.047 --> 1:10:20.672
For me, it's not an option
and I'm not giving you any passport.

1:10:20.755 --> 1:10:21.797
You're not going anywhere.

1:10:22.505 --> 1:10:25.130
I'll deliver you safely to the guy
when he comes, okay?

1:10:25.505 --> 1:10:26.422
So forget it.

1:10:48.213 --> 1:10:50.422
[in Pidgin] When is he coming? 
It's freezing.

1:10:54.713 --> 1:10:57.255
[in English] You know what? Let's look
for somewhere to warm up,

1:10:57.338 --> 1:10:59.672
'cause it's going to take some hours
before he comes. Come.

1:11:11.797 --> 1:11:13.588
[customers chattering]

1:11:36.380 --> 1:11:37.922
[waiter in German] Here you are, ladies.

1:11:38.547 --> 1:11:40.463
Some more tea.

1:11:42.797 --> 1:11:43.713
Thank you.

1:11:45.130 --> 1:11:46.130
[waiter] You're welcome.

1:12:53.380 --> 1:12:55.880
Thank you for granting us admittance.

1:12:56.588 --> 1:13:00.422
That shows you have a heart
for old traditions.

We bring only light,

all the figures of darkness

who keep even their own ones in chains.

The seven deadly sins
throughout the year are punished today.

No one has yet...

established his innocence."

1:13:30.505 --> 1:13:32.213
and avarice,

1:13:32.713 --> 1:13:35.088
you shall atone me!

1:13:35.838 --> 1:13:36.838
[costumed man growls]

1:13:36.963 --> 1:13:38.713
"Greed and avarice.

Could it be there are some for you here?

Envy and jealousy
is what enrages you, Leviathan.

1:13:47.338 --> 1:13:50.880
You may have a chance
to unleash your fury.

I don't even have that kind of money.
I'm just looking.

If I testify against the madame,

1:23:01.172 --> 1:23:03.380
will she be arrested by the police?

1:23:04.505 --> 1:23:06.547

Chances are quite good, I would say.

The police has done a good job.

1:23:08.422 --> 1:23:11.172
Those last months,
they have been observing her,

1:23:11.338 --> 1:23:13.297
they know so many things about her,

1:23:13.463 --> 1:23:15.838
but till now, nobody has testified.

1:23:16.005 --> 1:23:17.422
So you will be the first,

1:23:17.547 --> 1:23:21.172
so chances are quite good
that she will go to jail.

1:23:21.880 --> 1:23:25.547
Afterwards, do I get a visa,
a working permit?

1:23:25.963 --> 1:23:28.838
Well, about your permit
to stay in Austria,

1:23:29.047 --> 1:23:33.380
now that you are testifying,
giving names, giving addresses,

1:23:33.547 --> 1:23:38.672
helping the Austrian state
to get a criminal to prison,

1:23:38.880 --> 1:23:41.130
you know, then you have got really new…

1:23:41.838 --> 1:23:43.922
new reasons to apply for asylum,

1:23:44.005 --> 1:23:46.380
which does not mean
that you will get it, I have to tell you.

1:23:46.505 --> 1:23:49.297
It will be a long asylum process.

1:23:49.380 --> 1:23:52.005
We don’t know how it will turn out.

1:23:52.213 --> 1:23:53.963
But the possibility is there again.

1:23:54.422 --> 1:23:56.172
And do I get some money, like…

1:23:57.255 --> 1:23:59.505
do I get anything apart from the visa?

1:23:59.922 --> 1:24:01.338
Compensation or what?

1:24:01.630 --> 1:24:04.213
We don’t know where she hides her money,

1:24:04.297 --> 1:24:07.255
but, anyway, we will try
to get a compensation for you.

1:24:07.463 --> 1:24:09.338
So where are you living at the moment?

1:24:09.880 --> 1:24:11.755
Still in the apartment with the madame?

1:24:12.380 --> 1:24:16.130
No, no, I found myself a small flat.

1:24:16.547 --> 1:24:18.963
You're not hanging out
with those people, right?

1:24:19.755 --> 1:24:20.588
Which people?

1:24:20.713 --> 1:24:22.213
The people around the madame.

1:24:22.755 --> 1:24:23.672
Her friends.

1:24:24.505 --> 1:24:25.380
No.

1:24:25.463 --> 1:24:27.755
So you are not near their apartment
and so on.

1:24:27.838 --> 1:24:29.588
This is very important, Joy, I tell you,

1:24:29.713 --> 1:24:32.755
'cause if you go to trial,

1:24:33.172 --> 1:24:35.713
you have to be very clear on
which side you are on.

You have to stay away from those people

1:24:39.047 --> 1:24:40.713
also for your own safety.

1:24:41.505 --> 1:24:43.505
'Cause now that you've paid your debts,

you are a threat for the madame,

and who knows what she's capable of doing.

1:24:49.130 --> 1:24:50.755
Do you understand what I'm saying?

1:24:52.130 --> 1:24:54.213
-Yes.
-Are you very clear on that?
