No, I don't think you can.
I'm looking for
someone in authority.

29:48.913 --> 29:52.625
Well, I'm Dr. Morgan,
the senior biologist.

29:52.750 --> 29:53.793
Oh.

29:55.378 --> 29:56.546
Really?

30:00.216 --> 30:02.385
Charming. Philip FitzRoyce.

30:02.469 --> 30:04.220
I know you.
I know your work.

30:04.304 --> 30:07.474
We were at that Law of
the Sea Conference
together last summer.

30:07.557 --> 30:10.518
Oh yes, that's right.
Helsinki.
Save the Whales.

30:10.602 --> 30:11.936
They made a hero out of me.

30:12.020 --> 30:14.272
Yeah, you know what
I never understood?

30:14.355 --> 30:17.066
Why did you ram
that Japanese whaler?

30:17.400 --> 30:21.488
(CHUCKLING)
Because he got in my way,
ruined my best shot.

30:21.905 --> 30:24.574
Yeah. I was impressed.

30:26.743 --> 30:31.247
Good. Then perhaps
we can have a drink
and some dinner tonight?

30:32.916 --> 30:37.462
Oh, I'm sorry,
Mr. FitzRoyce, but, that's
a behavior I just don't do.

30:38.004 --> 30:39.297
(LAUGHING)

30:40.757 --> 30:44.385
Nice spins, Danny.
I'll meet you
at the holding tank.

30:46.846 --> 30:48.306
Hey, aqua girl!

30:48.389 --> 30:49.641
Hi, Mike!

30:50.433 --> 30:51.434
Five.

31:02.153 --> 31:03.154
(GRUNTING)

31:03.279 --> 31:05.740
He don't sleep in,
he don't live in.

31:06.241 --> 31:09.160
Tell Shelby Overman for me
he can take a flyin' leap

31:09.244 --> 31:12.288
at a rollin' doughnut
on a gravel driveway,
you hear?

31:12.372 --> 31:15.124
Hold it just a second.
Didn't he come
home last night?

31:15.250 --> 31:17.293
No.
He didn't show up
here either.

31:17.377 --> 31:18.586
I figure he's
home hung over.

31:18.670 --> 31:21.881
I tell you, the man's trash,
and I don't want him
around my place!

31:21.965 --> 31:24.133
He's gone.
You take his stuff.

31:24.217 --> 31:25.468
Charlene,
what's goin' on, huh?

31:25.552 --> 31:27.303
Shelby Overman's AWOL again.

31:27.387 --> 31:29.305
Oh, no. I'm sorry.

31:29.597 --> 31:30.640
What, is this
all his stuff?

31:30.723 --> 31:32.976
Yeah. Doesn't figure.

31:33.226 --> 31:36.688
He left his passport
and his...
And his credit cards.

31:36.771 --> 31:39.732
Driver's license,
pawn tickets.

31:40.316 --> 31:43.236
I don't think
he could have been
planning to go too far.

31:43.319 --> 31:44.779
You don't think
something happened to him?

31:44.862 --> 31:46.364
I mean, wouldn't the
police have called...

31:46.447 --> 31:50.451
No. No, look.
He is curled up,
drunk someplace.

31:50.535 --> 31:52.996
And when I find him,
he's in deep trouble.

31:53.079 --> 31:55.206
Don't you worry.
We'll let you know as soon
as we hear anything.

31:55.290 --> 31:56.249
Wanna help me out?

31:56.332 --> 31:57.834
Yeah. Take care, Charlene.

31:58.376 --> 31:59.377
Help me look in the lagoon?

31:59.460 --> 32:00.587
You bet.

32:00.670 --> 32:04.048
Hey, I'm mad at that old boy,
but I don't mean him any harm.

32:04.132 --> 32:07.010
You hear me?
I don't mean him any harm!

32:13.850 --> 32:15.602
Down a little more.

32:16.144 --> 32:17.353
Turn it.

32:21.608 --> 32:23.568
Batteries are
fully charged, Mike.

32:23.651 --> 32:24.652

32:24.736 --> 32:26.070
Thanks, Danny.

32:28.448 --> 32:31.743

MIKE: <i>He could have
gotten caught in
the superstructure.</i>

34:16.556 --> 34:18.474

Excuse me, gentlemen.
Mr. Bouchard...

38:07.620 --> 38:09.455
Wait a minute.
We're havin' dinner here.

38:09.538 --> 38:11.374
This better be important.
It is, sir.

38:12.208 --> 38:14.377
(WHISPERING) Mike and
Dr. Morgan were pursued
by a renegade shark

38:14.460 --> 38:15.461
that got into our lagoon.

38:15.878 --> 38:18.089
It is important, gentlemen.
Better come with me.

38:24.553 --> 38:26.973
KAY: Believe me, Calvin,
it was a great white.

38:27.056 --> 38:29.850
It was about ten feet long,
it was exhibiting a typical
feeding pattern.

38:30.059 --> 38:31.060
On us, Calvin!

38:31.143 --> 38:32.645
The damn thing tried
to feed on us.
Exactly.

38:32.728 --> 38:34.146
Now look.
Where is it?

38:34.230 --> 38:35.481
Right here.

38:39.819 --> 38:40.945
Huh?

38:41.028 --> 38:43.906
(WHISTLING) You know, Cal,
this could be
a stroke of luck.

38:45.741 --> 38:48.119
If we kill this beastie
on camera,

38:48.995 --> 38:51.497
I can guarantee you
media coverage.

38:53.624 --> 38:56.002
Lure him into a staging area,

38:56.085 --> 38:59.255
and at the precise moment,
slit his belly wide open.

39:01.424 --> 39:02.425
Can you do that?

39:02.508 --> 39:04.760
You try and stop him, mate.

39:04.844 --> 39:06.178
That's how we earn our bread.

39:06.262 --> 39:07.471
(CHUCKLING)

39:09.432 --> 39:12.768
Well, Jack is oversimplifying
matters, as is usual.

39:14.103 --> 39:16.397
But, yeah, I can do that.

39:16.480 --> 39:18.232

MIKE: No?

39:18.607 --> 39:20.109
What do you mean, no?

39:20.651 --> 39:22.862
Well, I don't know
if it's occurred to
any of you all,

39:22.945 --> 39:27.074
but there isn't
a great white alive
in captivity anywhere.

39:27.783 --> 39:30.411
Now, we're unique here,
Calvin, you know that.

39:30.494 --> 39:33.247
If any facility can
maintain a white, it's us.

39:33.456 --> 39:37.168
If we could dart him,
tranquilize him, we could
get him in a holding tank...

39:37.251 --> 39:40.921
Hold it! This is crazy,
this is nuts.

39:42.048 --> 39:44.133
White sharks are killers.
I know 'em.

39:44.633 --> 39:46.761
My father,
my brother, myself.

39:47.261 --> 39:49.346
They're murderers. No, Kay.

magnificently.

39:55.686 --> 39:56.937

39:57.605 --> 40:00.900
That would really be
a spectacular event.
No doubt about that, huh?

40:04.320 --> 40:07.114
What are we doing, Calvin,
planning a network special?

40:08.407 --> 40:11.535
Don't you realize that
we could be the first
people on the planet

40:11.619 --> 40:13.621
to have a
great white alive.

40:14.330 --> 40:17.166
Not if my guv'nor
gets it first, miss.

40:17.875 --> 40:21.462
Okay. Say he kills it.
Well, that's it.

40:21.754 --> 40:23.172
It's one shot, over, gone.

40:24.673 --> 40:28.552
But a live great white.
Now, you think about
that, Calvin!

into a holding tank.

Now, that's world news!

40:40.815 --> 40:42.691
Think of the lines
at the gate.

40:43.234 --> 40:45.444
Then you miss
the sport of the kill.

40:45.528 --> 40:47.988
Now, wait up, Jack.
Wait up.

Good. Just the way
I like it.
Right.

41:35.202 --> 41:36.537

41:36.620 --> 41:37.913
Exactly.

41:37.997 --> 41:39.540

get the close-ups.

Are you kidding?
Have you felt the...

41:45.588 --> 41:48.424
It won't bite through,
but it will yield to pressure.

41:48.507 --> 41:50.926
So she might just get
a little squeeze.

41:52.386 --> 41:56.182
Oh, that's great news.
Look, why do you
have to do this?

41:57.016 --> 41:59.894
Why don't you let
Her Majesty's number one
son take care of it, huh?

41:59.977 --> 42:02.229
Because it's my job,
remember?

42:02.646 --> 42:04.356
Yeah, but I just don't
want it to be you.

42:04.440 --> 42:10.237
Look, you build all the
stuff, I swim around in it.
That was the deal. Right?

42:10.321 --> 42:11.405
Hmm?

42:13.115 --> 42:14.700
I love you, too.

42:21.498 --> 42:24.960
If we get into any trouble,
all we have to
do is pull the pin.

42:26.754 --> 42:28.297
What are those?
JACK: Mills bombs.

42:28.380 --> 42:30.716
What?
Mills bombs, sonny.

Hey, Mike.
MIKE: Yeah!

01:13:22.900 --> 01:13:26.236
This is our last cut.
I think our tunnel
patch is ready to go.

01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:29.031
Good. Rig the winch
on that work boat up there.

01:13:29.114 --> 01:13:30.324
You got it.

01:13:32.785 --> 01:13:35.245
How much longer,
sweetie?
I don't know.

01:13:35.329 --> 01:13:36.455
No?

01:13:37.456 --> 01:13:40.209
We're gonna have
to nudge these tunnel
sections together.

01:13:40.292 --> 01:13:43.295
Then we're gonna slap on
a patch and we're gonna
weld the whole thing.

01:13:43.378 --> 01:13:44.630
Then we evacuate?

01:13:44.713 --> 01:13:47.007
No, then we gotta
put pressure back
into the tunnels,

01:13:47.091 --> 01:13:50.260
then the watertight
doors will open up,
then people go home.

01:13:51.345 --> 01:13:54.098
Hey, watch how you're
cutting that thing!
It's critical!

01:13:54.181 --> 01:13:57.059

01:14:02.856 --> 01:14:05.359
Listen.
I've been thinking.

01:14:06.193 --> 01:14:09.238
Maybe Venezuela can use
some trained whales, huh?

01:14:10.739 --> 01:14:12.866
What? Are you serious?
Yeah.

01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:15.160
I think this one's on me.

01:14:15.244 --> 01:14:17.496

I'll follow you anywhere.

01:14:17.579 --> 01:14:19.206

Is Mr. Bouchard
going to be here?

01:14:29.758 --> 01:14:32.678
Please, please.
I have a statement to make.

01:14:32.886 --> 01:14:34.596
Was there an explosion?
What about the fire?

01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:36.056
How many people are missing?

01:14:36.265 --> 01:14:39.101
Late this afternoon,
as a result of a
minor disturbance,

01:14:39.184 --> 01:14:41.854
there was a pressure
failure in one of the
underwater tunnels

01:14:41.937 --> 01:14:44.064
that are a major attraction
here at the park.

01:14:44.606 --> 01:14:47.234
We estimate that
30 to 40 people

01:14:47.484 --> 01:14:50.279
were in the process
of being evacuated

01:14:50.362 --> 01:14:54.408
when the watertight safety
doors temporarily
delayed their exit.

01:14:55.033 --> 01:14:57.119
We're working right now
to release them

01:14:57.202 --> 01:14:58.912
under the safest
possible circumstances.

01:15:00.497 --> 01:15:03.500
In addition, seven visitors
were injured in our
beach area.

01:15:04.209 --> 01:15:05.419
That's all for now.
Give me a break, boys.

01:15:05.502 --> 01:15:06.837
What is this we've heard
about a large shark?

01:15:07.212 --> 01:15:10.632
I'll let you know
as I know more.
A very large shark...

01:15:11.592 --> 01:15:13.343
That's all. There is no more.

01:15:14.303 --> 01:15:15.554
WOMAN: When will
they get this fixed?

01:15:15.637 --> 01:15:17.347
GUIDE: I'm sure they're
working on it.

01:15:17.931 --> 01:15:21.018
Stay together to keep warm.
I know you're cold.

01:15:21.810 --> 01:15:26.857
Stay together, take shallow
breaths and concentrate
on your breathing, okay?

01:15:44.208 --> 01:15:45.626
Well, any sign
of mother?

01:15:48.670 --> 01:15:49.671
Okay, then.

01:15:51.757 --> 01:15:53.467
Where did the animal
hide the first time?

01:16:02.643 --> 01:16:06.521
Brody, is there
an access hatch,
a backwash gate?

01:16:08.523 --> 01:16:09.733
Heavy grillwork.

01:16:09.816 --> 01:16:12.319
Keeps the pumps
clear when we back-flush
that system.

01:16:12.402 --> 01:16:15.697
Why? What do you want to do?
Get that thing back in?

01:16:17.032 --> 01:16:18.158
He's a bright lad.

01:16:18.700 --> 01:16:23.413
Yes. Jack and I are
going to lure him back
into the pipe,

01:16:23.497 --> 01:16:27.584
close the gates
and then dispose of
him at our leisure.

01:16:27.668 --> 01:16:29.336
Meanwhile, you can weld
your tunnel patch

01:16:29.419 --> 01:16:31.713
and then Calvin can
evacuate the civilians.

01:16:32.881 --> 01:16:35.050
What if she doesn't
want to go back in?

01:16:36.134 --> 01:16:39.137
Oh, I think we can pretty
much guarantee
she'll want to go back in.

01:16:39.221 --> 01:16:41.014
Don't you, Jack?
Sure.

01:16:42.266 --> 01:16:44.184
Just how are you
going to guarantee that?

01:17:04.413 --> 01:17:05.872
I'll be in the
Control Room.

01:17:06.456 --> 01:17:08.041
I'll go with you.

Let me stow it over here.

01:17:14.715 --> 01:17:15.716

01:17:18.719 --> 01:17:20.053

Now, where's
that damn fish?

01:17:33.817 --> 01:17:35.068
There. I've got him.

01:17:35.819 --> 01:17:37.946

Babies, stay out
of it, please.

01:17:44.036 --> 01:17:45.620
And I've rigged
a lifeline.

01:17:46.747 --> 01:17:50.542
Just let the pumps push
you out and use the rope
to pull yourself back in.

01:17:51.043 --> 01:17:52.044
Right.

01:17:53.628 --> 01:17:55.714
And why don't
I do all the filming?

01:17:57.841 --> 01:18:00.552
I want both cameras.
We need the coverage.
Come on, Jack!

if you did just
the one thing.

about right there.

01:18:24.910 --> 01:18:27.746
