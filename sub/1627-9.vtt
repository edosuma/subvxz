11:11.004 --> 11:12.505
he doesn't exist.

11:13.131 --> 11:14.337
He has to.

11:15.050 --> 11:19.168
Of course, biologically, he exists
but there is no record of him.

11:20.180 --> 11:21.590
Which means we have no choice.

11:21.682 --> 11:25.641
These children need a home. So they
will be put into the foster system.

11:25.727 --> 11:27.513
Storybrooke has a foster system?

11:27.604 --> 11:29.890
No. But I've contacted the state.

11:30.941 --> 11:33.603
Maine's group homes,
unfortunately, are filled,

11:33.694 --> 11:36.481
but they put us in touch
with two homes in Boston.

11:36.572 --> 11:38.312
A boys' home and a girls'.

11:39.074 --> 11:40.905
They're separating them?

11:40.993 --> 11:42.654
I don't like it either.

11:43.370 --> 11:45.235
But we've got no choice.

11:45.330 --> 11:47.161
You need to have them
in Boston tonight.

11:47.249 --> 11:48.329

11:48.417 --> 11:50.908
Well, you wanted to be sheriff.

11:51.503 --> 11:53.664
This is what sheriffs do.

11:53.755 --> 11:54.915
Yes, you're taking them.

11:55.007 --> 11:57.544
No. I promised them
they wouldn't be separated.

11:57.634 --> 12:00.671
Well, then perhaps you should stop
making promises you can't keep.

12:03.265 --> 12:05.881
These children need a home.

12:05.976 --> 12:08.217
I'm just trying to find the best one.

12:10.272 --> 12:11.808
What is that?

12:11.899 --> 12:15.391
My father's compass.
He gave it to me so I could find him.

12:15.944 --> 12:17.480
But now it's broken.

12:19.239 --> 12:21.446
When are you gonna tell us
where we're going?

12:22.910 --> 12:23.899
This is close enough.

12:23.994 --> 12:25.404
Close enough to what?

12:27.414 --> 12:28.915
The home of the Blind Witch.

12:30.292 --> 12:32.203
That doesn't sound good.

12:32.961 --> 12:36.920
She has something of mine.
And I need you to get it back.

12:37.007 --> 12:38.042
What is it?

12:38.133 --> 12:41.216
Something I need to defeat a very
wicked and powerful enemy.

12:42.763 --> 12:46.972
It's kept in a black leather satchel
inside her house.

12:50.729 --> 12:53.266
Because the house
is protected by magic.

12:53.357 --> 12:54.392
I can't enter.

12:55.817 --> 12:59.275
But luckily the spell
doesn't work on children.

12:59.655 --> 13:02.146
You'll have to wait here
until nightfall.

13:02.282 --> 13:05.490
And then, once the witch is asleep,

13:06.995 --> 13:08.656
you can sneak in.

13:10.415 --> 13:14.579
And if we do this,
you promise you'll find our father?

13:14.670 --> 13:16.661
Oh, indeed |Wi||.

13:17.631 --> 13:19.667
But there's one more thing.

13:19.758 --> 13:21.339
The witch's house is

13:23.512 --> 13:24.501
unique.

13:25.180 --> 13:28.798
And because of this, you have to take
special precaution once you're inside.

13:29.559 --> 13:30.594
Like what?

13:30.686 --> 13:35.271
No matter what you do,
no matter how you're tempted,

13:36.066 --> 13:40.184
don't eat anything.

14:26.575 --> 14:28.190
Sounds like a familiar story.

14:28.285 --> 14:30.742
Whoever this guy is,
he could be in Laos by now.

14:31.079 --> 14:32.489
No, he's here.

14:32.622 --> 14:34.908
(SCOFFS) And just
how do you know that?

14:35.000 --> 14:37.036
'Cause no one leaves Storybrooke.

14:37.127 --> 14:38.583
No one comes here.

14:38.670 --> 14:41.412
No one goes. It's just the way it is.

14:41.506 --> 14:42.495
I came here.

14:42.591 --> 14:44.331
Because you're special.

14:44.426 --> 14:47.042
You're the first stranger here, ever.

14:47.596 --> 14:48.836
Right. I forgot.

14:48.930 --> 14:51.717
Well, if he's around here anywhere,
I'm gonna find him.

14:56.521 --> 14:58.432
Can you tell me about him?

14:58.523 --> 15:00.605
I don't know anything yet.

15:00.984 --> 15:03.100
Not their father. Mine.

15:04.863 --> 15:08.947
I told you about your parents,
now you're even living with your mom.

15:09.576 --> 15:10.611
Mary Margaret isn't...

15:11.078 --> 15:12.113
She's...

15:14.372 --> 15:15.782
Never mind.

15:16.249 --> 15:18.205
Please.

15:23.548 --> 15:24.754
I was pretty young.

15:25.967 --> 15:27.548
I had just gotten out
of the foster system.

15:27.636 --> 15:32.221
And the onlyjob I could get was at
this 24-hour dinerjust off the interstate.

15:35.143 --> 15:37.725
And your dad
was training to be a fireman.

15:37.813 --> 15:39.098
He always got the worst shifts.

15:39.189 --> 15:41.851
So he'd come in
and order coffee and pie,

15:41.942 --> 15:43.227
and sit at the counter,

15:43.318 --> 15:45.809
and always complain
that we didn't sell pumpkin pie.

15:48.532 --> 15:50.898
But he always came back
the next night anyway.

15:51.576 --> 15:52.611
Did you get married?

15:52.869 --> 15:55.030
(CHUCKLES) Oh, no, nothing like that.

15:55.831 --> 15:59.164
We just... We hung out a few times
outside of work.

16:01.002 --> 16:02.378
And life happened.

16:02.462 --> 16:04.919
His got better and mine got worse,

16:05.715 --> 16:07.296
and I got in some trouble.

16:08.176 --> 16:10.508
When you went to jail?

16:11.221 --> 16:13.462
(INHALES) Yeah.

16:14.599 --> 16:19.013
Before Iwent, I found out
I was pregnant with you.

16:20.981 --> 16:23.688
And I tried to contact him.

16:27.028 --> 16:28.859
And I found out

16:29.948 --> 16:34.282
that he died saving a family
from a burning apartment building.

16:36.830 --> 16:40.493
So, you think I'm a savior, Henry?

16:40.917 --> 16:42.248
He was.

16:43.837 --> 16:45.702
Your father was a real hero.

16:46.756 --> 16:51.466
Do you have anything of his?
Something you can remember him by?

16:53.180 --> 16:54.511
Something I could see?

16:58.643 --> 16:59.632
I don't.

17:02.397 --> 17:04.979
Henry. I'm sorry. I gotta go.

17:06.359 --> 17:08.395
I may know how to find this guy.

17:18.455 --> 17:20.491
I want to show you guys something.

17:21.958 --> 17:22.947
What's that?

17:23.376 --> 17:24.661
It's my baby blanket.

17:25.962 --> 17:27.338
It's something
I've held on to my whole life.

17:27.422 --> 17:31.665
It's the only thing that I have
from my parents.

17:34.221 --> 17:36.837
I spent a lot of time with
a lot of kids in your situation,

17:37.807 --> 17:39.388
and all of them,

17:40.435 --> 17:41.424
all of us,

17:42.103 --> 17:43.684
we held on to stuff.

17:44.689 --> 17:48.932
I want to find your father,
but I need your help.

17:49.736 --> 17:53.194
Is there anything of his
you've held on to?

17:53.698 --> 17:55.313
I might have something.

17:56.409 --> 17:57.615
But if I give it to you,

17:58.787 --> 18:00.618
you'll make sure
we stay together, right?

18:01.706 --> 18:02.741
Right.

18:09.798 --> 18:11.459
A compass?

18:11.549 --> 18:13.631
Our mom kept it.

18:14.970 --> 18:16.460
She said it was our dad's.

18:18.056 --> 18:19.045
Thank you.

18:21.017 --> 18:22.973
Did you find them?

18:23.061 --> 18:24.050
Who?

18:24.145 --> 18:25.760

18:26.815 --> 18:29.773
Not yet. But I'm gonna find yours.

be sure she's sleeping?

19:31.588 --> 19:32.998
Doesn't matter.

I'm flattered you'd take time off
your busy schedule for me.

20:52.252 --> 20:53.458
What can I do for you, Sheriff?

20:54.879 --> 20:56.995
I'm looking for information
on this old compass.

20:57.507 --> 20:59.372
Any idea where
it could have come from?

20:59.467 --> 21:00.752
Well, well.

21:01.803 --> 21:03.168
Look at the detail.

21:03.638 --> 21:05.799
You know, this is crystal.

21:05.974 --> 21:08.181
This jeweled setting.

21:08.518 --> 21:10.383
And despite
the rather unfortunate shape it's in,

21:10.478 --> 21:12.685
this is actually
a very unusual piece.

21:14.274 --> 21:16.981
The person who owned this
obviously had great taste.

21:17.068 --> 21:18.808
And where would someone
like that buy it?

21:19.320 --> 21:20.651
Right here, of course.

21:21.281 --> 21:22.236
You know it?

21:22.323 --> 21:25.451
Indeed. A piece like this
is difficult to forget.

21:25.535 --> 21:27.651
Do you happen to remember
who bought it?

21:27.829 --> 21:28.944

Well, I'm good with names, Ms. Swan,
but maybe not that good.

21:35.003 --> 21:38.120
However, as luck would have it,

21:38.590 --> 21:42.048
I do keep quite extensive records.

21:44.846 --> 21:47.428
And yes. Here we are.

21:51.644 --> 21:53.100
What's your price?

21:53.188 --> 21:54.644
Forgiveness.

21:56.232 --> 21:57.688
How about tolerance?

21:59.027 --> 22:00.016
Well, that's a start.

22:01.946 --> 22:04.198
The compass was purchased
by a Mr. Michael Tillman.

22:04.574 --> 22:05.689
Anything else?

22:05.783 --> 22:07.489
Just a name.

22:07.577 --> 22:09.738
But I generally find
that's all one needs.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.207

22:46.699 --> 22:50.317
No. It's not possible.
I don't have twins.

22:50.995 --> 22:53.987
Yes, you do.

22:54.082 --> 22:55.993
You have twins that have been

22:56.084 --> 22:57.324
homeless ever since
their mother passed away.

22:57.418 --> 23:00.160
You have twins who've been living
in an abandoned house

23:00.255 --> 23:01.836
because they don't wanna be separated
from each other.

23:02.298 --> 23:04.710
Your twins are about
to be shipped off to Boston

23:04.801 --> 23:07.042
unless you step up
and take responsibility for them.

23:07.554 --> 23:10.671
Look, I can barely manage this
garage. I can't manage two kids.

23:12.350 --> 23:14.090
And why are you so sure they're mine?

23:15.395 --> 23:17.010
Besides the timing?

12 years and nine months ago?

23:37.375 --> 23:40.367
I know it's a lot.
Believe me, I know.

23:40.461 --> 23:43.077
A month ago, a kid showed up
on my doorstep I gave up for adoption

23:43.172 --> 23:45.788
asking for help with something.

23:46.426 --> 23:48.382
And I ended up moving here. For him.

23:48.469 --> 23:50.801
I heard about that.
It's the mayor's son.

23:50.888 --> 23:55.302
But staying in town is a lot
different than taking him in.

23:55.685 --> 23:59.394
I don't have my kid
because I don't have a choice.

23:59.480 --> 24:00.606
You do.

24:01.858 --> 24:04.099
Those kids did not ask
to be brought into this world.

24:04.193 --> 24:06.900
You brought them into this world.
You and their mother.

24:06.988 --> 24:08.569
And they need you.

24:08.656 --> 24:10.738
And if you choose not to take them,

24:10.825 --> 24:14.409
you are gonna have to answer
for that every day of your life.

24:14.495 --> 24:18.158
And sooner or later, when they find you,
because believe me, they will find you,

24:21.044 --> 24:23.035
you're gonna have to answer to them.

is that the false hope I gave them
was exactly that.

but it can also be cathartic.

28:33.212 --> 28:35.043
Were you successful in your task?

28:35.131 --> 28:37.747
Yes, Your Majesty. Though we were
almost made into dinner.

28:38.217 --> 28:40.299
Oh, how barbaric.

28:42.930 --> 28:47.094
Now, if I could have my satchel.

28:54.108 --> 28:55.814
I've waited
a very long time for this.

28:57.612 --> 28:59.898
Let's hope you didn't let me down.

29:08.247 --> 29:09.453
(GASPS)

29:09.957 --> 29:11.458
You did it.

29:12.960 --> 29:14.200
Yeah, we did.

29:17.715 --> 29:20.377
You've got a strong heart, girl.

29:21.469 --> 29:23.380
You remind me of myself at your age.

29:24.305 --> 29:27.217
We did all that for an apple?

29:27.308 --> 29:30.141
Trust me, dear boy,
this is notjust an apple.

29:31.145 --> 29:32.134
It's a weapon.

29:34.482 --> 29:38.100
A weapon for a very particular
and devious enemy.

29:39.153 --> 29:42.316
One who's still under the illusion

29:45.534 --> 29:47.741
that she's safe.

29:47.828 --> 29:49.659
Whatever your plan is,
we did what you asked.

29:50.498 --> 29:53.285
Now you have to keep your promise
and find our father.

29:54.001 --> 29:55.537
Of course.

29:56.754 --> 29:58.494
To reunite your family.

29:59.507 --> 30:02.214
So you can live happily ever after.

30:03.010 --> 30:05.296
You were left alone in the woods.

30:05.388 --> 30:08.846
You deserve better than a father
who would abandon you.

30:11.644 --> 30:13.259
(VOICE BREAKS) But he's all we have.

30:15.064 --> 30:16.975
Perhaps he doesn't have to be.

30:17.066 --> 30:18.602
What do you mean?

30:18.693 --> 30:21.935
You and your brother
have impressed me.

30:22.363 --> 30:24.149
You aren't the first boy or girl

30:24.240 --> 30:28.825
that I've sent into
that sticky sweet house.

30:30.705 --> 30:32.696
But you are the first to emerge.

30:34.709 --> 30:35.949
And as a reward,

30:38.087 --> 30:42.456
I've decided to invite the two of you
to live with me

30:43.426 --> 30:44.415
here.

30:44.885 --> 30:49.299
You mean we get to live in a castle?

30:49.390 --> 30:50.880
(LAUGHS) Yes.

30:51.809 --> 30:53.845
You would have your own rooms,
of course.

30:54.729 --> 30:57.892
Personal carriages, and valets, too.

30:58.566 --> 31:01.729
All of your dreams could come true.

31:02.653 --> 31:03.642
No.

31:04.405 --> 31:06.316
We want our father back.

31:06.407 --> 31:07.943
He would never abandon us.

31:08.576 --> 31:09.565
And even if he did,

31:10.286 --> 31:13.494
we would never want to live
with someone as terrible as you.

31:14.665 --> 31:15.871
Is that so?

31:15.958 --> 31:19.917
Yes. We're going to find him,
with or without your help.

31:20.838 --> 31:23.204
And when we do,
we're going to prove you wrong.

31:23.299 --> 31:24.755
We'll see about that.

They can't.

Tell me where they are!

but a compass to find their way.

33:55.201 --> 33:57.283
You're here to answer mine.

I offered your children everything,
whatever their hearts desired.

34:05.294 --> 34:10.163
And they still chose uncertainty
because of their blind faith in you.

34:11.926 --> 34:14.167
Tell me why. Hmm?

34:16.305 --> 34:18.637
Why did your children refuse me?

34:19.516 --> 34:21.347
Because we're a family.

might be the best plan.

wouldn't make it so hard to look.

that my parents put me
in a magical wardrobe
