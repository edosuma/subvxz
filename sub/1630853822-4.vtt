Now, the biggest issue
facing telemedicine

13:10.456 --> 13:12.917
is the last mile of care.
The pipeline of people

13:13.000 --> 13:14.752
needing annual booster shots
is endless,

13:14.835 --> 13:16.045
and you can't get a shot online.

13:16.128 --> 13:19.798
Not yet. Until iPhone gets
that retractable syringe.

13:19.882 --> 13:21.050
-(CHUCKLES)

13:21.133 --> 13:22.551

13:22.635 --> 13:25.054
Uh, but for now, you need
a physical location.

13:25.387 --> 13:26.555
Yeah.

13:26.639 --> 13:29.475
-What's your take on this?
-It's compelling.

13:29.558 --> 13:31.852
Uh, but slightly reductive,

13:31.936 --> 13:34.939
in the sense that the bull case
is what, that it's...

13:36.106 --> 13:37.566
an acquisition target?

13:38.776 --> 13:41.695
I still think Rican
is the telemedicine play

13:41.779 --> 13:44.698
and you could not be
better positioned for it now.

13:44.782 --> 13:46.492
But, as you say,
Jesse already owns that.

13:46.575 --> 13:49.119
It's compelling
and I gotta concede

Because let me tell you
there are plenty of shops

51:34.299 --> 51:36.676
that'll take us in a heartbeat

from 75 million to 40.

only 40 percent leaves us space

now that Felim is gone.
