WEBVTT

00:03.455 --> 00:05.245
When the bough breaks,

00:05.305 --> 00:08.751
the cradle will fall and down...

00:08.832 --> 00:12.622
will come baby Cradle and all.

00:14.749 --> 00:16.175
That's kind of a dark song.

00:24.761 --> 00:26.340
- Are you happy?
- You asked me

00:26.400 --> 00:28.646
- to get you some ice cream.
- Did I tell you to blend it?

00:28.670 --> 00:30.858
I didn't remember the blender being
that loud before.

00:30.918 --> 00:34.171
And this morning, you didn't remember
that the dryer beeps on wrinkle guard.

00:34.231 --> 00:36.085
It was a beep... a single beep!

00:36.357 --> 00:38.997
How can something with such little ears
have such bionic hearing?

00:44.152 --> 00:45.181
Okay.

00:46.388 --> 00:48.890
Help me... please...

00:50.625 --> 00:51.747
help me.

01:36.799 --> 01:38.508
Must you do that now, Tony?

01:39.821 --> 01:41.761
It's spring.
I'm spring-cleaning, so...

01:42.193 --> 01:44.305
- yes.
- Spring-cleaning?

01:44.386 --> 01:46.224
You don't have spring-cleaning
in Israel?

01:46.643 --> 01:47.940
We do not have spring.

01:48.327 --> 01:49.669
Israel is a desert.

01:52.700 --> 01:54.148
I've been looking for this.

02:01.644 --> 02:03.241
I remember those days,

02:03.792 --> 02:05.928
when I was carefree and full of joy.

02:06.555 --> 02:09.330
- I envy you, Tony.
- Why are you dressed for a funeral?

02:09.556 --> 02:11.192
- Everything okay?
- No.

02:12.333 --> 02:13.584
Frank is sick.

02:13.665 --> 02:14.752
Who is Frank?

02:14.833 --> 02:16.337
My mandibular second molar.

02:16.866 --> 02:19.590
It's been killing me for a week.
I'm finally going to the dentist.

02:20.180 --> 02:21.341
You name your teeth?

02:21.557 --> 02:22.557
You don't?

02:24.050 --> 02:26.343
- No.
- See, that's the problem.

02:26.868 --> 02:28.348
They're just teeth to you.

02:28.556 --> 02:30.018
But evolutionarily speaking,

02:30.357 --> 02:33.412
your survival is directly proportionate
to their health.

02:33.866 --> 02:36.357
A cavity was a death sentence
on the Savannah.

02:36.558 --> 02:38.389
Abby, everyone gets cavities.

02:38.449 --> 02:39.449
No.

02:39.567 --> 02:42.613
No Sciuto has had
a cavity since 1922.

02:42.797 --> 02:44.317
- Good genes.
- Genes?

02:44.631 --> 02:47.160
I brush, and I floss,
and I tongue-scrape more

02:47.240 --> 02:49.579
than most people
would consider sane.

02:49.785 --> 02:51.689
I have earned my perfect record.

02:51.910 --> 02:53.837
No cavities, no surrender.

02:54.040 --> 02:55.532
I don't deserve this.

02:56.807 --> 02:58.870
- I'll be back before lunch.
- Good luck.

02:59.421 --> 03:01.023
Don't get too comfortable.

03:01.580 --> 03:02.580
Dead body.

03:02.683 --> 03:04.761
Come on...
you all know the drill.

03:10.708 --> 03:11.804
He looks cold.

03:12.712 --> 03:14.479
That's the least of his problems,
McGee.

03:14.560 --> 03:16.814
Hey, boss.
Parents didn't have much to add.

03:17.291 --> 03:19.776
Baby's room was empty,
except for the baby.

03:20.048 --> 03:22.128
They kept hearing the voice
through the baby monitor.

03:22.449 --> 03:23.988
Cops did a search of the area.

03:24.718 --> 03:26.135
All they found was him.

03:26.195 --> 03:29.407
They identified the body
as Marine Private First Class...

03:29.783 --> 03:30.912
Marco Riggs.

03:31.422 --> 03:35.333
And I am identifying some pretty
gnarly toes. This guy needed a pedicure.

03:35.591 --> 03:38.294
Bothers you so much,
DiNozzo, go find his shoes.

03:38.702 --> 03:40.466
Boss, I'm going
to go find his shoes.

03:40.526 --> 03:43.145
This would explain
the voice the parents heard.

03:43.510 --> 03:45.902
Our dead guy had
a military-issue cell scanner.

03:46.189 --> 03:48.762
Not exactly standard-issue
for privates.

03:49.621 --> 03:51.557
That's probably why
he was misusing it.

03:53.621 --> 03:55.206
Take a look at the display, boss.

03:57.475 --> 03:58.475
911?

03:58.747 --> 04:02.627
Looks like Riggs was trying to use
the cell scanner as a cell phone.

04:02.687 --> 04:04.821
Ended up broadcasting
in a narrowband frequency.

04:05.497 --> 04:08.699
- Got picked up by the baby monitor.
- I don't know about the feet, though.

04:08.780 --> 04:11.436
That's because you don't know
your history, McGee.

04:11.496 --> 04:12.750
Historically,

04:13.083 --> 04:15.206
going about unshod was considered

04:15.286 --> 04:17.834
by some to be an act
of pious devotion,

04:18.119 --> 04:19.060
while others...

04:19.120 --> 04:23.052
Believed that direct contact with Mother
Earth provided spiritual benefits.

04:23.309 --> 04:27.260
However, in Roman and medieval times,
going barefoot symbolized poverty,

04:27.472 --> 04:31.120
since leather and boots were
too expensive for the average...

04:31.873 --> 04:32.873
Really?

04:33.788 --> 04:35.726
I wrote a paper on...

04:36.624 --> 04:37.624
Never mind.

04:38.853 --> 04:41.520
Cyanosis indicates lack of oxygen.

04:41.580 --> 04:43.691
No signs of strangulation
or ligature marks.

04:43.774 --> 04:45.528
Did you write a paper on those, too?

04:47.716 --> 04:48.906
Time of death...

04:50.408 --> 04:51.576
two hours ago.

04:52.013 --> 04:53.076
That a problem?

04:53.485 --> 04:56.205
Mr. Palmer, help me with the body.

04:56.784 --> 05:00.311
Yes, well, he's remarkably stiff

05:00.371 --> 05:01.919
for the recently deceased.

05:02.257 --> 05:04.881
It's too soon for rigor,
even at this temperature.

05:05.245 --> 05:06.395
There's no...

05:06.961 --> 05:09.969
entry wounds, no sign of trauma,

05:10.065 --> 05:11.971
but something sucked
the life out of him.

05:15.455 --> 05:17.271
Sucked the life out is right.

05:19.252 --> 05:21.211
Abby is going to love this.

05:22.772 --> 05:23.875
Thank you!

05:24.278 --> 05:26.082
What a way to start the day.

05:31.093 --> 05:32.244
Abby Sciuto?

05:33.980 --> 05:35.518
- Maybe?
- FBI.

05:35.840 --> 05:37.508
You need to come with us,
Ms. Sciuto.

05:37.568 --> 05:38.268
Now.

05:38.328 --> 05:40.333
- Where?
- I'm not at liberty to say.

05:40.557 --> 05:42.542
Well, then,
I'm not at liberty to go.

05:42.625 --> 05:44.036
You misunderstand.

05:44.213 --> 05:45.630
It's not a request.

05:57.200 --> 06:00.289
The deceased was
Private First Class Marco Riggs.

06:00.602 --> 06:03.876
Recently assigned to CLB-3,
Combat Logistical Battalion,

06:03.958 --> 06:06.378
- supporting troops in Afghanistan.
- Until he was accused

06:06.438 --> 06:08.707
of stealing equipment,
then selling it on the black market.

06:08.731 --> 06:10.929
That include military-issue
cell scanners?

06:10.989 --> 06:14.544
It did, but Riggs disappeared
before he could be formerly charged.

06:14.715 --> 06:16.264
He's been listed UA since last week.

06:16.344 --> 06:17.759
Apartment was a dead end.

06:17.925 --> 06:19.541
We have a BOLO out on his vehicle.

06:19.601 --> 06:21.311
Also waiting
on the blood work from Abby.

06:21.418 --> 06:23.505
We're going to have
to wait a little bit longer.

06:23.873 --> 06:25.482
Don't tell me
she needs a root canal.

06:25.843 --> 06:27.454
No, Fornell just called.

06:28.167 --> 06:29.367
Abby's been...

06:30.291 --> 06:31.291
requested.

06:32.042 --> 06:33.042
Requested?

06:33.228 --> 06:34.228
By?

06:34.418 --> 06:37.395
He didn't know. It just said
the FBI has orders to transport her.

06:38.772 --> 06:41.745
Okay, I can access
the FBI operations database.

06:41.930 --> 06:43.375
I have a contact at the DOD.

06:43.723 --> 06:45.502
BOLO out on the FBI transport?

06:45.951 --> 06:46.981
I don't know.

06:47.041 --> 06:48.233
I thought...

06:48.293 --> 06:50.501
maybe I'd just try
to call her first.

06:57.043 --> 06:58.920
Hey, Gibbs. Don't worry.

06:58.980 --> 07:00.726
No cavities.
I was going to call.

07:00.988 --> 07:02.602
Fornell already did. You okay?

07:02.683 --> 07:04.354
- Yep.
- Where are you?

07:04.586 --> 07:05.689
In the back of a van.

07:05.859 --> 07:06.709
Abby...

07:06.795 --> 07:07.795
I'm fine.

07:08.001 --> 07:09.001
It's exciting.

07:09.285 --> 07:11.653
Group of FBI agents swoops in and

07:11.735 --> 07:14.964
steals away an unsuspecting citizen
to places unknown.

07:15.981 --> 07:18.201
Yeah, it's the unknown part
I don't care for.

07:18.899 --> 07:20.829
I got Palmer's text
about the vampire bite.

07:21.004 --> 07:23.041
I can't believe I'm not going
to be there for that.

07:23.101 --> 07:25.292
- Who are you getting to fill in?
- Working on it.

07:25.710 --> 07:27.923
Well, if you need
anything before then,

07:27.983 --> 07:30.797
I keep a step-by-step
"Abby's Lab for Dummies"

07:30.878 --> 07:34.676
in my desk. It covers the basics.
A monkey could follow the instructions.

07:37.089 --> 07:38.089
Good.

07:38.977 --> 07:40.881
'Cause we got one of those.

07:42.861 --> 07:45.987
Did you realize that the end was nigh,
I wonder,

07:46.047 --> 07:48.134
or was it a blissful event...

07:48.599 --> 07:51.234
as your ego and judgment
melted away?

07:51.477 --> 07:53.648
- I mean, a stroke from...
- Doctor?

07:54.862 --> 07:55.906
Yes, Mr. Palmer.

07:56.503 --> 07:58.158
May I stop mopping now?

07:58.439 --> 08:00.160
- It depends.
- On?

08:00.733 --> 08:03.371
Has it enhanced
your understanding of protocol?

08:04.453 --> 08:05.624
Consider me enhanced.

08:05.859 --> 08:07.334
Good... then you may join me.

08:07.508 --> 08:09.246
That invitation extend to me,
too, Duck?

08:09.549 --> 08:12.425
Since when have you waited for
an invitation? Don't answer that.

08:12.485 --> 08:15.052
I know, you like to keep people
on their toes.

08:16.242 --> 08:17.242
Yes, Doctor.

08:17.305 --> 08:18.305
Protocol.

08:18.674 --> 08:20.669
What? Okay, yes.

08:20.835 --> 08:23.559
I will go not be in this room now.

08:24.347 --> 08:25.347
What do you got?

08:25.490 --> 08:28.104
Well, sadly for Abby,
not the walking dead.

08:28.346 --> 08:31.036
A histological examination
of these wounds

08:31.096 --> 08:33.943
revealed that they're burn marks,
not punctures.

08:34.113 --> 08:37.280
More consistent with a stun gun attack
than a vampire bite.

08:37.607 --> 08:40.318
- A stun gun?
- Not normally a lethal weapon.

08:40.378 --> 08:41.618
However, I believe

08:41.857 --> 08:43.995
the electrical shock aggravated

08:44.076 --> 08:46.762
an underlying arterial weakness
in his brain,

08:47.162 --> 08:49.417
and that led
to a hemorrhagic stroke.

08:50.253 --> 08:53.964
After he regained consciousness,
he would've been severely confused.

08:54.380 --> 08:58.064
He could've wandered around for hours
before taking refuge on that...

08:58.351 --> 09:00.679
- loading dock.
- Then he took his shoes off?

09:01.431 --> 09:04.043
Yeah, well,
it's called peripheral neuropathy.

09:04.103 --> 09:06.304
It's common in this kind of stroke.

09:06.364 --> 09:09.240
His feet would have felt
as if they were burning up,

09:09.300 --> 09:11.772
but I doubt that he knew
what he was doing.

09:11.953 --> 09:13.976
Towards the end,
he would have been delirious,

09:14.036 --> 09:16.135
until eventually,
his heart would have given out.

09:16.195 --> 09:18.154
Stun gun's a defensive weapon, Duck.

09:18.471 --> 09:19.471
Yeah.

09:19.927 --> 09:23.159
Which suggests
his death was unintentional.

09:23.674 --> 09:25.912
I found something
under his fingernails.

09:26.140 --> 09:29.129
It almost certainly came
from the assailant during the assault.

09:29.189 --> 09:31.459
I need to send it up
to Abby's replacement.

09:31.686 --> 09:33.646
Well, that's going to be
a long run, Ducky.

09:33.856 --> 09:35.756
Just spoke to the DOD, boss.

09:35.831 --> 09:38.058
Abby's replacement
doesn't arrive until Monday.

09:38.118 --> 09:39.446
- Monday?
- Monday.

09:39.506 --> 09:41.140
I made a lot of noise,
but, you know,

09:41.200 --> 09:44.066
they gave me a lecture about budget
cuts. We did catch a break, though.

09:44.126 --> 09:46.224
Got a BOLO back
from our dead guy's car.

09:46.877 --> 09:48.268
Want me to take Ziva, or...?

09:48.503 --> 09:49.823
No, I'll take Ziva.

09:50.135 --> 09:51.135
You...

09:51.968 --> 09:52.968
you take McGee.

09:54.146 --> 09:55.333
Take McGee where?

09:59.741 --> 10:01.711
Now, why did I get picked
for the cover art?

10:02.973 --> 10:04.501
You want to sign, or should I?

10:05.061 --> 10:06.061
I will.

10:06.334 --> 10:09.267
I am the one with a biomedical
engineering degree from Johns Hopkins.

10:09.327 --> 10:11.039
Among several other degrees.

10:11.099 --> 10:13.275
Maybe that's why you got picked
for the cover art.

10:18.782 --> 10:19.782
Come in.

10:21.981 --> 10:22.981
Ma'am.

10:28.586 --> 10:29.586
Hi.

10:38.396 --> 10:39.396
Yes.

10:39.773 --> 10:40.570
From NCIS?

10:40.771 --> 10:41.771
Yep.

10:47.774 --> 10:49.748
I asked you here...

10:50.634 --> 10:52.549
"Asked me." That's a good one.

10:53.877 --> 10:55.585
At the request
of Dr. Phillip Heller.

10:56.080 --> 10:57.320
He's in charge of a...

10:57.552 --> 10:59.311
rather special project.

10:59.722 --> 11:01.091
Is it a military project?

11:01.459 --> 11:04.427
Funded by the military,
but Tarburst is an independent agency.

11:05.650 --> 11:07.597
I'm not familiar
with Dr. Heller's work.

11:07.885 --> 11:09.867
No, but he is with yours.

11:09.927 --> 11:13.880
He was quite impressed with your paper
on Zinc Finger Nucleases in DNA Binding.

11:15.651 --> 11:17.899
What kind of project are we talking
about exactly?

11:19.711 --> 11:21.945
Not the kind of project
we can talk about.

11:22.258 --> 11:24.874
It's why I was reluctant to allow
your participation initially.

11:25.959 --> 11:27.951
This is a highly classified matter.

11:28.464 --> 11:29.464
So, what changed?

11:30.775 --> 11:33.292
Dr. Heller is no longer
with the program, and we...

11:34.646 --> 11:35.646
your country...

11:36.654 --> 11:37.904
need your help.

11:40.567 --> 11:41.711
What do you need?

11:45.337 --> 11:46.468
Welcome to The Cave.

11:47.408 --> 11:48.408
The Cave?

11:50.163 --> 11:52.222
You should rename
this place Nirvana.

11:53.278 --> 11:55.395
Dr. Heller was given
a sizable budget.

11:56.827 --> 11:57.827
I can see that.

11:58.463 --> 11:59.816
And almost complete autonomy.

12:00.090 --> 12:01.943
All information
was compartmentalized,

12:02.024 --> 12:04.756
strictly need-to-know.
Only three other people, besides myself,

12:04.816 --> 12:06.698
even knew of the existence
of this program.

12:07.541 --> 12:09.533
- Knew?
- Two of the original team members

12:09.616 --> 12:12.663
died in a roadside bomb attack
in Afghanistan.

12:12.841 --> 12:15.848
Which is why Dr. Heller's departure
from the program has become...

12:16.257 --> 12:17.298
quite a problem.

12:17.951 --> 12:20.784
This was sold to the Senate
Select Committee on a warning

12:20.844 --> 12:23.298
of a grave and gathering threat.

12:24.654 --> 12:26.948
What exactly was
Dr. Heller working on?

12:28.215 --> 12:29.332
That's the problem.

12:30.185 --> 12:31.292
We don't know.

12:45.835 --> 12:48.781
Patients aren't allowed on this floor.
How did you get in here?

12:49.677 --> 12:51.533
It's a hospital, isn't it?
How do you think?

12:52.156 --> 12:53.952
No, the hospital's upstairs.
This is...

12:54.033 --> 12:55.766
I know what this is, Sunshine.

12:56.231 --> 12:58.744
I've escaped from P.O.W. camps
with better security.

13:02.674 --> 13:04.245
Just exercising the lungs.

13:05.809 --> 13:06.809
Retired Marine.

13:07.344 --> 13:10.038
Sergeant Major Robert King, N.C.

13:11.200 --> 13:12.200
N.C.?

13:12.883 --> 13:15.307
Not contagious.
In case you were worried.

13:16.220 --> 13:17.226
I was.

13:19.183 --> 13:20.344
Where's Heller?

13:20.616 --> 13:21.814
We got a game to finish.

13:24.357 --> 13:25.896
Dr. Heller, he's...

13:26.909 --> 13:28.464
he's no longer with the project.

13:30.287 --> 13:32.012
- He isn't, huh?
- No.

13:34.182 --> 13:36.693
Well, doesn't that seem
a little strange?

13:36.873 --> 13:38.956
I mean, you know, considering...

13:39.785 --> 13:40.785
Considering what?

13:41.844 --> 13:45.254
God gave you a body, I'll give him that.
Skimped on the brain, though.

13:48.572 --> 13:50.926
Don't know how well
you know the doctor,

13:51.141 --> 13:52.411
but if you knew Heller,

13:52.471 --> 13:54.816
you'd know he wouldn't run off
and leave all this.

13:57.850 --> 13:58.934
She found me.

14:00.971 --> 14:01.671
Who?

14:01.845 --> 14:03.196
Nurse Dunstan.

14:03.827 --> 14:06.024
Makes Al Qaeda look
like Jiminy Cricket.

14:10.710 --> 14:11.845
I'm sorry.

14:12.138 --> 14:14.700
He knows he's not supposed
to come down here.

14:17.253 --> 14:20.454
None of the patients are supposed
to come down here.

14:20.747 --> 14:22.061
I won't tell.

14:22.471 --> 14:24.293
- Thank you.
- Let's go.

14:24.627 --> 14:27.516
Next time you get out of bed,
I'm having you catheterized.

14:28.502 --> 14:29.502
You wish.

14:32.256 --> 14:35.288
Nurse Dunstan...
your liaison with the hospital.

14:35.348 --> 14:37.714
If you need anything, extension 405.

14:37.804 --> 14:38.804
Thank you.

14:39.377 --> 14:41.351
And the lab rabbits
should be here by 12:00.

14:42.200 --> 14:45.172
Hopefully this batch lasts longer
than the last.

14:45.645 --> 14:46.751
Quick march.

14:52.736 --> 14:55.394
Are you gonna help me, or are you
gonna keep screwing around back there?

14:55.418 --> 14:58.449
Every single drawer in this lab
is unlocked except this one.

14:58.764 --> 15:00.358
You're not wondering what's inside?

15:01.033 --> 15:03.540
I'm wondering where Palmer is
with the rest of that DNA.

15:04.378 --> 15:05.395
Right here.

15:05.961 --> 15:08.335
Here you go. Thought
I might be able to help you guys.

15:08.395 --> 15:10.430
I do have lab experience.

15:10.490 --> 15:13.935
And I have a biomedical engineering
degree from Johns Hopkins.

15:13.995 --> 15:15.469
He sure does love saying that.

15:15.644 --> 15:17.429
Hey, will you put
the screwdriver down,

15:17.510 --> 15:20.425
come in here, and hand me
the ethidium bromide, please?

15:20.691 --> 15:21.691
I got it.

15:23.849 --> 15:25.729
I don't think that's right...

15:27.759 --> 15:29.569
I don't think
you're supposed to do that.

15:29.768 --> 15:30.621
All right.

15:30.681 --> 15:33.824
Next step is to... mix the gel

15:34.462 --> 15:36.767
- with the ethidium bromide.
- I don't think you're supposed

15:36.791 --> 15:39.245
to do that. I think you're supposed
to microwave the gel first...

15:39.269 --> 15:42.037
All right, Mr. Johns Hopkins,
Mr. Biomedical Degree.

15:42.496 --> 15:43.897
You go ahead.

15:47.929 --> 15:49.429
- That's not good.
- Nope.

15:50.055 --> 15:51.062
Knucklehead.

15:51.752 --> 15:54.007
Lucky for you Abby's not here,
Hopkins.

15:55.191 --> 15:58.929
Why is McGee lucky that I'm not there
and who is Hopkins?

16:00.637 --> 16:01.637
Where are you?

16:01.684 --> 16:04.203
I'm at a public hospital
just outside the city.

16:04.263 --> 16:06.785
That's all I can say. They took
my cell phone away when I got here,

16:06.809 --> 16:08.801
but I was able to open
a video port into my lab...

16:09.923 --> 16:10.923
or...

16:11.013 --> 16:12.276
what's left of my lab.

16:12.508 --> 16:13.617
He'll clean it up.

16:13.686 --> 16:15.570
- We'll clean it up.
- They'll clean it up.

16:15.792 --> 16:18.865
You'll all clean it up. But I need you
to run a background for me first.

16:19.187 --> 16:21.124
Background on who?
Is everything all right?

16:21.184 --> 16:22.889
I e-mailed the info to McGee.

16:23.001 --> 16:24.483
You didn't answer the question.

16:24.543 --> 16:26.623
Everything is fine.
Okay, I got to go.

16:27.061 --> 16:30.377
I shouldn't leave this video port open.
And Tony, screwdrivers...

16:30.437 --> 16:32.582
they leave tool marks
on locked drawers.

16:38.400 --> 16:39.740
It's our dead guy's car.

16:40.061 --> 16:41.929
And he appears
to have been living in it.

16:42.011 --> 16:43.598
What is it doing here?
We're almost

16:43.679 --> 16:46.597
two miles away from the loading dock
where the victim's body was found.

16:46.796 --> 16:49.563
That is a long distance
to have wandered after the attack.

16:50.671 --> 16:52.542
Well, if there was an attack here.

16:53.704 --> 16:54.860
No sign of a struggle.

16:54.941 --> 16:57.046
There are houses not too far away.

16:57.745 --> 17:01.730
Maybe our victim parked here
for a planned rendezvous of some kind.

17:02.858 --> 17:03.858
Maybe.

17:08.897 --> 17:10.166
This is nice.

17:11.776 --> 17:14.532
Being able to work
without Tony's incessant babbling.

17:15.817 --> 17:17.388
It is almost as if he cannot...

17:17.449 --> 17:19.968
go on for more than 30 seconds
without hearing his own voice.

17:21.430 --> 17:24.164
You know, the truly amazing thing is
that he fails to realize

17:24.223 --> 17:26.349
just how irritating
he is to those around him.

17:28.862 --> 17:29.895
Yes, Gibbs?

17:30.487 --> 17:31.487
Babbling.

17:42.253 --> 17:43.367
- Gibbs?
- What?!

17:44.566 --> 17:45.922
Victim's trunk.

17:51.997 --> 17:54.612
I'm not so sure our victim
was the intended victim.

17:57.612 --> 17:58.612
Come in.

17:59.297 --> 18:00.297
Mr. Jones.

18:02.850 --> 18:03.950
Any progress?

18:06.879 --> 18:07.879
I'm done.

18:08.640 --> 18:11.561
- That was fast.
- Well, it's pretty esoteric stuff.

18:11.864 --> 18:13.772
Basically, Dr. Heller was...

18:14.111 --> 18:18.026
attempting to hijack DNA's end-joining
pathways in order to...

18:18.174 --> 18:20.703
Target a specific strand
of a person's DNA?

18:21.906 --> 18:23.909
Why do I get the feeling
you already knew that?

18:24.231 --> 18:26.299
Maybe because I already knew that.

18:28.017 --> 18:29.174
Was he successful?

18:29.991 --> 18:32.332
He was close. What do you mean
you already knew that?

18:34.675 --> 18:36.990
Given the sensitive nature
of this project,

18:37.050 --> 18:40.115
I had to make sure you were the real
McCoy before I fully read you in.

18:40.175 --> 18:41.275
So you lied.

18:41.801 --> 18:44.302
And I didn't lose a minute's sleep.
Is that a problem?

18:44.383 --> 18:45.383
No.

18:45.864 --> 18:46.864
Not at all.

18:47.115 --> 18:49.098
Lie to me again. It was awesome.

18:49.611 --> 18:52.062
- Nice knowing you.
- Wait. Miss Sciuto.

18:53.213 --> 18:54.213
You can't leave.

18:54.268 --> 18:55.689
Really? That's funny.

18:55.863 --> 18:57.732
'Cause it really seems...

18:57.814 --> 19:00.444
like I'm, you know, leaving.

19:07.430 --> 19:09.119
Okay, just out of curiosity,

19:10.087 --> 19:11.204
why can't I leave?

19:11.889 --> 19:13.331
Because if you don't help us...

19:16.350 --> 19:17.856
they're all going to die.

19:27.369 --> 19:28.445
Let's hear it.

19:34.516 --> 19:36.225
Did you find anything good
at Riggs' car?

19:36.285 --> 19:38.648
Actually, yes. We found a...

19:39.224 --> 19:40.442
What is that smell?

19:41.404 --> 19:42.404
Still?

19:42.756 --> 19:45.362
You're kidding me.
I washed my hands a dozen times.

19:45.444 --> 19:47.073
- Wash 'em again.
- Sorry, boss.

19:47.133 --> 19:50.870
Had a little mishap in Abby's lab,
running the DNA on Riggs' attacker.

19:50.930 --> 19:52.123
More like Riggs' victim.

19:52.183 --> 19:55.415
The contents of Riggs' trunk suggest
he was planning on burying a body.

19:56.055 --> 19:58.460
- You think he was on some kind of hit?
- Until it went bad.

19:58.661 --> 20:01.650
He apparently did not count
on his target fighting back.

20:01.810 --> 20:03.466
Do we have any idea
who his victim was?

20:03.526 --> 20:07.323
I do. Palmer and I just finished running
the DNA from under Riggs' fingernails.

20:07.716 --> 20:09.282
You already tell Gibbs?

20:09.918 --> 20:11.045
Tell Gibbs what?

20:11.823 --> 20:13.104
You found the target.

20:13.516 --> 20:14.516
What?

20:14.966 --> 20:17.729
This is Dr. Heller. It's the guy
Abby wanted us to run background on.

20:21.558 --> 20:24.320
Abby was asked to take over for Heller
when he went missing.

20:25.217 --> 20:27.121
Well, I'm guessing
he disappeared because...

20:27.181 --> 20:29.080
Someone was trying to kill him.

20:30.060 --> 20:32.190
And Abby has just taken his place.

20:44.398 --> 20:47.800
Agent Gibbs, I appreciate your concern
for my missing colleague,

20:47.985 --> 20:50.636
but that's exactly why Miss Sciuto
needs to stay here right now.

20:51.254 --> 20:52.671
You have to trust me on that.

20:52.892 --> 20:54.431
I don't trust you.

20:54.873 --> 20:55.944
I don't know you.

20:56.004 --> 20:57.985
I sympathize with your position...

20:58.203 --> 21:00.819
It's your choice! You either tell me
what's going on or...

21:00.879 --> 21:03.691
- Or what? You'll threaten me?
- Well, you know what?

21:03.772 --> 21:04.960
That depends.

21:05.124 --> 21:08.070
You consider
a public investigation a threat?

21:12.309 --> 21:14.326
We are on the same team.

21:18.178 --> 21:19.507
About a year ago,

21:20.293 --> 21:22.708
my company became involved
in a larger medical study

21:22.894 --> 21:25.294
of servicemen returning
from Afghanistan. It was...

21:25.607 --> 21:29.017
rather routine until we discovered
small numbers were suffering

21:29.077 --> 21:32.094
from an undiagnosed illness that
was originally thought to be fatigue.

21:32.888 --> 21:34.172
We alerted the military.

21:34.408 --> 21:37.145
They didn't want to make the same
mistake they did with Gulf War Syndrome.

21:37.169 --> 21:38.802
Good. Good for them.

21:38.862 --> 21:41.478
We got a contract to research
the illness. We set up this lab.

21:41.855 --> 21:44.398
The hope was, if we could identify
the susceptible genotype,

21:44.696 --> 21:46.368
a cure could be developed.

21:46.428 --> 21:50.140
Okay, well, obviously, somebody there
doesn't want that to happen.

21:51.138 --> 21:52.613
We don't know where Dr. Heller is.

21:52.737 --> 21:55.916
All right, his disappearance may have
nothing to do with this research.

21:55.976 --> 21:58.260
Okay, until we find out,

21:58.658 --> 22:00.247
I want Abby here.

22:00.574 --> 22:02.212
I'm afraid
that's not going to happen.

22:02.272 --> 22:04.376
Did I just not make myself clear?!

22:04.559 --> 22:05.864
You misunderstand me.

22:09.439 --> 22:10.486
Hi, Gibbs.

22:10.896 --> 22:11.896
Hi, Abs.

22:12.822 --> 22:14.593
- You all right?
- Everything's fine,

22:15.416 --> 22:18.305
except you and I still have
to talk about the lab bunnies.

22:18.388 --> 22:20.267
Listen, Gibbs,
I know what you're going to say.

22:20.348 --> 22:22.348
You're worried
because someone is after the doctor,

22:22.405 --> 22:24.874
and if someone's after the doctor
and I took over his job,

22:24.934 --> 22:27.273
they might be after me.
But I don't care.

22:27.571 --> 22:31.403
These people are sick and I can
help them and I'm staying, period.

22:32.594 --> 22:34.110
Besides, this is a secure hospital.

22:34.170 --> 22:36.198
I'm just as safe here
as I would be at NCIS.

22:36.417 --> 22:38.410
Safer, actually,
'cause they have bigger dogs.

22:41.066 --> 22:44.129
I'd tell you not to argue with her,
but, uh, I think you already know that.

22:46.188 --> 22:47.878
"Afghanistan War Syndrome."

22:48.066 --> 22:49.298
If this guy Heller...

22:49.358 --> 22:51.598
was working on a cure,
why would someone try to kill him?

22:51.630 --> 22:54.133
No connection
between PFC Riggs and Heller.

22:54.546 --> 22:56.100
Maybe he was a hired gun?

22:56.441 --> 22:57.591
It is likely.

22:58.354 --> 22:59.388
So who hired him?

22:59.593 --> 23:00.926
Good question, McGee.

23:01.815 --> 23:04.269
- Got the file from Jones?
- Yeah, reading it now.

23:04.815 --> 23:05.815
How is Abby?

23:06.426 --> 23:07.426
Committed.

23:07.566 --> 23:09.858
You can say that again.
She'd be safer here.

23:10.132 --> 23:12.568
Best way to protect her is
to solve our original case.

23:12.815 --> 23:13.862
Find Heller.

23:14.315 --> 23:17.071
We cannot be sure the doctor's
disappearance is tied to his work.

23:17.131 --> 23:19.284
And even if it is,
he's not going to be easy to find.

23:19.568 --> 23:21.786
The FBI's had a BOLO out
since Monday.

23:25.871 --> 23:27.876
Dr. Phillip Heller,

23:28.232 --> 23:29.232
not M.D.

23:29.682 --> 23:33.088
Got his PhD in molecular biology.
Did a post-doc on Gulf War Syndrome.

23:33.319 --> 23:36.508
Wife, no kids, was treated
for a gambling addiction ten years ago.

23:36.568 --> 23:39.172
- Which seems to be under control now.
- Credit card bills are low...

23:39.196 --> 23:42.088
gas, groceries, flowers.
Does not spend more than he earns.

23:42.148 --> 23:45.400
He was working at a V.A. hospital
when he joined Jones' program.

23:49.695 --> 23:50.856
Start with the wife.

24:03.326 --> 24:05.147
On your six, boss.

24:14.001 --> 24:16.115
I love a woman
who's good with her hands.

24:16.759 --> 24:17.759
And smart, too.

24:22.310 --> 24:24.702
I thought you said
God skimped on the brains.

24:24.956 --> 24:27.072
Well, I'm a man of contradictions.

24:27.446 --> 24:28.565
Am I interrupting?

24:31.404 --> 24:32.404
Yes.

24:34.591 --> 24:35.901
You got anything else?

24:36.152 --> 24:37.654
It's giving me a headache.

24:38.842 --> 24:39.842
Thank you.

24:41.419 --> 24:42.759
I'm on the run.

24:43.080 --> 24:44.448
It's bath time.

24:45.195 --> 24:48.872
"Nurse Ratched" takes a little bit
too much pleasure in it for my taste.

24:50.197 --> 24:51.197
It's a shame,

24:51.360 --> 24:54.004
'cause if she was my type,
this would be the setup of a lifetime.

25:03.709 --> 25:05.453
You're not asking me any questions.

25:05.990 --> 25:08.267
Must mean you already got
your answers.

25:16.983 --> 25:18.320
You're sick, aren't you?

25:19.042 --> 25:20.193
You have it.

25:21.834 --> 25:23.907
Take a guess at the first question.

25:25.681 --> 25:26.960
But what is "it"?

25:27.380 --> 25:29.129
That's the million-dollar mystery.

25:30.469 --> 25:32.709
Have you finished isolating our...

25:32.790 --> 25:34.869
genes or whatever it is
you're doing down here?

25:36.475 --> 25:37.881
I'm close.

25:39.570 --> 25:41.419
That's what Heller used to say.

25:42.367 --> 25:43.845
Look what happened to him.

25:45.858 --> 25:46.858
He...

25:47.873 --> 25:48.942
he got...

25:49.867 --> 25:50.867
transferred.

25:51.167 --> 25:52.479
You're a horrible liar.

25:52.560 --> 25:53.736
I know.

25:56.241 --> 25:58.119
Me, I lied for a living.

25:59.183 --> 26:01.238
Used to run some
of the biggest black ops in...

26:01.869 --> 26:04.365
Panama, both Gulf Wars, Afghanistan.

26:06.432 --> 26:07.868
I was very important.

26:09.993 --> 26:11.345
You're still important.

26:11.909 --> 26:12.909
Yeah,

26:13.038 --> 26:14.291
as a guinea pig,

26:14.599 --> 26:15.919
nothing else, just like...

26:16.276 --> 26:17.276
him.

26:17.565 --> 26:19.250
That's okay, I guess.

26:20.135 --> 26:21.349
When I signed up,

26:21.825 --> 26:24.465
it was because I was willing to die
for my country, and I still am.

26:24.807 --> 26:27.304
I dodged a bullet,
more than my fair share,

26:27.925 --> 26:29.807
but these boys today are... they...

26:30.622 --> 26:33.395
you know, they drill 'em to survive
gunshot wounds, land mines,

26:34.039 --> 26:35.230
air strikes.

26:37.183 --> 26:40.025
Nobody warned 'em about
"synergistic effects"

26:40.279 --> 26:42.112
"of battlefield contaminants".

26:42.847 --> 26:43.862
Check.

26:46.258 --> 26:47.840
Sorry, I'm just that good.

26:51.361 --> 26:53.081
We're going to figure this out,
you know.

26:54.374 --> 26:56.668
Don't make any promises
you can't keep.

26:57.402 --> 26:58.877
But I got one that you can.

27:02.562 --> 27:03.562
Anything.

27:05.843 --> 27:07.228
Whatever this thing is,

27:08.700 --> 27:10.305
just don't let 'em name it after me.

27:11.922 --> 27:12.922
Deal.

27:14.029 --> 27:15.590
But you have to do something for me.

27:16.124 --> 27:17.124
Anything.

27:18.280 --> 27:20.240
Did you really escape
from a P.O.W. camp?

27:20.687 --> 27:21.387
Twice.

27:21.675 --> 27:22.675
Why?

27:23.751 --> 27:24.813
His buddies.

27:24.873 --> 27:26.047
Rescue mission.

27:32.180 --> 27:33.180
I'm in.

27:37.993 --> 27:39.365
Garage sales.

27:39.425 --> 27:40.860
Always a little strange.

27:41.374 --> 27:42.962
I mean, what is this stuff?

27:43.229 --> 27:44.263
What is that?

27:44.480 --> 27:46.468
One man's junk is
another man's junk.

27:48.319 --> 27:49.836
Excuse me, are you Lois Heller?

27:50.483 --> 27:51.483
Yeah.

27:51.784 --> 27:53.478
Need to talk to you
about your husband.

27:55.346 --> 27:56.346
He's dead.

27:57.124 --> 27:58.937
No, no,
we just don't know where he is.

28:00.376 --> 28:01.844
Well, that makes two of us.

28:02.252 --> 28:03.502
What are you...

28:03.562 --> 28:04.569
a 42 long?

28:06.897 --> 28:07.937
Well, that's...

28:08.624 --> 28:10.306
When was the last time
you spoke to him?

28:10.366 --> 28:13.373
About three days ago,
if you could call it speaking.

28:13.628 --> 28:16.039
We don't exactly have
what you'd call a good marriage.

28:16.119 --> 28:18.515
- Yeah, I'm picking up on that.
- Here, it's about your size.

28:18.539 --> 28:20.028
He give you any idea where he was?

28:20.302 --> 28:21.210
Five bucks.

28:21.270 --> 28:23.225
I'll give you three.
Is this your husband's?

28:26.971 --> 28:27.934
All right, look,

28:27.994 --> 28:29.594
the FBI have already been here,

28:29.675 --> 28:31.596
and I've already told them
everything I know.

28:31.819 --> 28:35.058
My husband said he was going out
for a walk and he never came back.

28:35.501 --> 28:37.414
Far as I'm concerned,
he doesn't need to.

28:38.560 --> 28:40.127
You should think about that coat.

28:40.379 --> 28:41.704
It'd look good on you.

28:42.117 --> 28:43.468
Yeah, thanks.

28:44.856 --> 28:48.028
Well, I guess we got motive. Doesn't
strike me as the kind of girl who'd...

28:48.282 --> 28:49.555
hire a hit man, though.

28:50.102 --> 28:51.616
No, she'd rather do it herself.

28:51.874 --> 28:53.036
Should we bring her in?

28:53.096 --> 28:54.500
Flowers first.

28:54.796 --> 28:55.663
Flowers?

28:55.723 --> 28:57.173
Husband's credit card.

28:57.233 --> 28:59.471
Don't think
he was sending them to her.

29:01.187 --> 29:02.310
Girlfriend, right.

29:02.874 --> 29:06.713
We traced the flowers to a house
in Landover owned by a Maggie Smith.

29:06.925 --> 29:09.272
She claimed
Heller was not there, but.

29:09.737 --> 29:10.737
I smelled fish.

29:14.646 --> 29:15.646
What?

29:16.381 --> 29:18.016
Fishy, something fishy.

29:19.198 --> 29:22.479
We found Dr. Heller hiding inside.
Tried to run when he saw us.

29:22.698 --> 29:26.066
He did not get far,
and he was carrying this.

29:27.961 --> 29:28.961
A stun gun.

29:29.512 --> 29:32.365
Matches the same marks
Ducky found on PFC Riggs' neck.

29:38.764 --> 29:39.822
You recognize him?

29:42.328 --> 29:43.328
Yes.

29:43.574 --> 29:45.017
You want to tell me about it?

29:46.744 --> 29:48.171
I had nothing to do with that.

29:48.661 --> 29:52.385
Well, then, how did your DNA end up
underneath his fingernails?

29:55.515 --> 29:58.035
I would be thrilled to sit here
and just charge you with murder.

29:58.327 --> 29:59.327
Murder?

29:59.645 --> 30:00.894
He tried to kill me.

30:01.171 --> 30:03.061
Like I said,
you want to tell me about it?

30:06.298 --> 30:07.901
I came home
from work three days ago.

30:08.097 --> 30:09.830
Needed to clear my head,
so I took a walk.

30:09.890 --> 30:12.405
Suddenly this guy grabs me,
shoves a gun in my face.

30:12.830 --> 30:14.239
I defended myself.

30:14.538 --> 30:15.645
Is that a crime?

30:20.454 --> 30:22.040
You always carry one of these?

30:23.718 --> 30:24.718
Lately.

30:25.822 --> 30:28.511
You didn't go back home,
you didn't call the police. Why?

30:28.909 --> 30:31.423
The police?
People get mugged all the time.

30:31.814 --> 30:34.469
I figured the guy'd be long gone
before the police even got there.

30:36.423 --> 30:37.722
I'm telling you the truth.

30:37.830 --> 30:39.474
I didn't say you weren't.

30:41.134 --> 30:42.435
But you're not.

30:43.193 --> 30:46.104
You didn't go back home
because they knew where you lived.

30:46.578 --> 30:48.565
This wasn't a mugging,
this was a hit.

30:49.455 --> 30:50.455
That's crazy.

30:51.755 --> 30:53.298
A hit on me?

30:53.507 --> 30:55.781
Unless you think
my wife hired somebody.

30:56.141 --> 30:57.521
I know about the lab...

30:58.174 --> 31:00.453
and I know about the cure
you were researching.

31:02.769 --> 31:04.957
- That's classified.
- And that's a dead body!

31:05.456 --> 31:07.024
I already got you at manslaughter.

31:07.084 --> 31:09.212
I can prove intent,
I got you at murder.

31:09.292 --> 31:09.994
Wait...

31:10.054 --> 31:12.881
You tell me what's going on,
or you call your damn lawyer!

31:14.756 --> 31:17.929
- Why is somebody trying to kill you?
- Because I discovered the truth.

31:22.766 --> 31:24.017
Tarburst tried to hide it.

31:25.425 --> 31:29.390
The tasks were compartmentalized,
ostensibly for security purposes.

31:30.018 --> 31:32.709
Isolate a genome,
find a suitable viral vector.

31:33.842 --> 31:35.029
They manipulated me.

31:35.896 --> 31:38.825
All I could see were the technical
hurdles and not the big picture.

31:38.906 --> 31:39.951
Which was what?

31:41.959 --> 31:43.340
People were sick,

31:44.226 --> 31:46.141
but I wasn't working on a cure.

31:48.532 --> 31:49.870
I was building a weapon.

32:01.200 --> 32:03.270
I don't know where they came from,
but suddenly

32:03.330 --> 32:05.680
there was, like, a dozen rabbits
running through the halls.

32:06.213 --> 32:07.390
Ready to celebrate?

32:11.028 --> 32:12.812
- Where is he?
- Hang on a second.

32:17.045 --> 32:19.901
This is...
is Sergeant King's room, right?

32:20.547 --> 32:21.547
It was.

32:22.545 --> 32:23.545
I'm sorry.

32:24.112 --> 32:25.162
You family?

32:28.485 --> 32:29.662
Does it matter?

32:30.693 --> 32:31.848
Not really.

32:32.109 --> 32:33.438
Why don't you take a minute.

32:33.924 --> 32:35.921
Sorry about that.
It's been a long day.

32:44.421 --> 32:45.421
Well...

32:47.377 --> 32:48.723
the good news is, I did it.

32:49.901 --> 32:51.229
I isolated the...

32:53.200 --> 32:54.346
Never mind.

32:55.370 --> 32:57.329
You would find that so boring.

32:58.675 --> 32:59.733
It's not a cure...

33:00.736 --> 33:02.555
but it maybe, someday...

33:03.281 --> 33:04.281
would...

33:05.012 --> 33:06.012
I found her!

33:08.738 --> 33:09.938
You're all right?

33:11.729 --> 33:12.729
No.

33:13.124 --> 33:14.372
What are you doing here?

33:15.601 --> 33:16.791
The lab is secure.

33:21.364 --> 33:22.797
What's going on?

33:34.550 --> 33:36.354
- Abs, you okay?
- Do I look okay?

33:36.435 --> 33:38.142
What is Abby's rule number one?

33:38.202 --> 33:39.732
"Do not lie to Abby."

33:40.487 --> 33:42.242
We left Heller
in charge at the hospital.

33:42.302 --> 33:45.655
Unfortunately, someone has already
downloaded all of Abby's research.

33:45.740 --> 33:47.930
Research? It was a weapon.

33:47.990 --> 33:50.034
People were dying,
and I was a building a weapon.

33:50.503 --> 33:52.620
Jones is gone.
Aide said he left in a hurry.

33:52.701 --> 33:55.039
- I'll put out a BOLO.
- I'll coordinate with local LEOs.

33:57.634 --> 33:58.634
How bad?

34:00.819 --> 34:02.928
Jones had me create an enzyme

34:02.988 --> 34:05.131
to target the genomes
of the sick soldiers.

34:05.898 --> 34:08.261
- Is that bad?
- By itself, it's innocuous,

34:08.915 --> 34:09.915
but then,

34:10.030 --> 34:12.509
he had Dr. Heller
create an immunogen

34:12.569 --> 34:15.518
to help the immune system
kill off foreign invaders.

34:15.752 --> 34:18.271
That's bad.
No, it's the way every vaccine works.

34:18.380 --> 34:20.063
Yeah, but
when you put them together...

34:20.632 --> 34:22.857
You can target
someone via their DNA.

34:23.007 --> 34:26.319
You can infect an entire water supply
and only kill your intended victim.

34:26.632 --> 34:28.219
We both made a piece of it.

34:28.280 --> 34:31.036
Heller made the bullet,
and I made the gun.

34:32.089 --> 34:33.606
Assassination made easy.

34:33.871 --> 34:36.204
But really, I mean,
a gun would be easier.

34:36.696 --> 34:38.578
Didn't build it to kill someone.

34:40.083 --> 34:41.252
Built it to sell it.

34:42.686 --> 34:43.686
Perfect.

34:44.132 --> 34:46.051
"Hi, I'm Abby Sciuto,"

34:46.250 --> 34:48.099
"international bioweapons dealer".

34:48.159 --> 34:50.719
Wait a second. How did Jones get it
past his supervisors?

34:51.263 --> 34:52.647
Sick soldiers.

34:53.257 --> 34:54.724
You don't ask too many questions.

34:56.072 --> 34:57.121
Oh, my God.

35:03.720 --> 35:05.259
Come on, damn it!

35:07.984 --> 35:08.984
Come on...

35:17.541 --> 35:18.980
Oh, no.

35:28.880 --> 35:30.751
- Yeah, Abs.
- Tony, check your inbox...

35:30.811 --> 35:32.971
- I need another BOLO ASAP.
- Have you talked to Gibbs?

35:33.003 --> 35:34.721
I didn't talk to Gibbs yet.
Just do it!

35:34.781 --> 35:35.781
All right.

35:36.813 --> 35:38.603
I can hear you staring.

35:39.869 --> 35:41.099
What'd you find, Ab?

35:41.598 --> 35:43.022
It's what I didn't find, Gibbs.

35:43.377 --> 35:46.269
I don't think there ever was
an Afghanistan War Syndrome.

35:46.329 --> 35:47.753
Soldiers were getting sick,

35:47.982 --> 35:49.946
'cause soldiers do,
but look at this.

35:51.066 --> 35:53.266
Someone in the lab was swapping out
their diseased blood

35:53.293 --> 35:54.629
with healthy samples.

35:54.689 --> 35:57.006
Doctors had sick patients,
but normal test results.

35:57.066 --> 35:58.580
They couldn't find a cause.

35:58.865 --> 36:01.465
They thought they had another mystery
war syndrome on their hands.

36:01.502 --> 36:02.854
Jones tricked the army.

36:03.445 --> 36:04.959
They had no idea what was going on.

36:05.349 --> 36:07.962
He got them to finance the project,
and he wasn't alone.

36:10.519 --> 36:14.135
Nurse Dunstan was the nurse on call
every time there was a blood test.

36:15.568 --> 36:17.320
I thought it was just a coincidence.

36:17.637 --> 36:19.136
She was in on it with Jones.

36:19.423 --> 36:20.768
I should have seen it, Gibbs.

36:23.005 --> 36:24.729
Aren't you going
to give me a pep talk?

36:26.559 --> 36:27.559
No.

36:28.563 --> 36:29.563
Why?

36:30.112 --> 36:31.551
Because you're pissed.

36:32.226 --> 36:33.279
And you should be.

36:36.023 --> 36:37.831
- Yeah. Gibbs.
- A body's been found...

36:38.755 --> 36:39.755
Where?

36:43.955 --> 36:45.883
A hiker saw her body being dumped.

36:45.943 --> 36:47.762
- Get a description?
- Nothing useful.

36:47.822 --> 36:51.489
She was on the way to the coroner
when the local LEOs got our BOLO.

36:51.755 --> 36:55.344
An on-site assessment report
indicates manual strangulation.

36:55.426 --> 36:57.291
It appears she and Jones had
a falling out.

36:57.351 --> 36:59.515
He didn't need her anymore.
He was tying up loose ends.

36:59.819 --> 37:01.690
We have a tire print.
Abby is running it.

37:01.750 --> 37:05.521
I imagine this must have been
quite an ordeal for her.

37:05.994 --> 37:06.994
How is she doing?

37:07.696 --> 37:09.067
Much better now.

37:09.127 --> 37:11.697
Boss, no luck on the tire prints,

37:11.757 --> 37:14.995
but Abby has been monitoring
every cell tower in the tri-state area.

37:15.055 --> 37:17.700
She picked up a data fetch
from Jones' smartphone.

37:18.906 --> 37:20.626
He was checking
airline departure times.

37:20.686 --> 37:22.723
- You get an airline?
- And a flight number.

37:26.143 --> 37:29.052
You messed
with the wrong forensic scientist.

37:32.690 --> 37:33.637
Did I miss it?

37:33.697 --> 37:35.167
No, he's letting him sit.

37:35.613 --> 37:36.385
Sit?

37:36.466 --> 37:37.635
He gets a chair?!

37:38.435 --> 37:39.435
He...

37:40.018 --> 37:41.484
he kills bunnies!

37:51.119 --> 37:52.460
I'm impressed.

37:52.730 --> 37:54.777
Didn't expect anyone
to come looking for me so soon.

37:55.209 --> 37:56.989
One-way ticket to Chile?

37:57.933 --> 37:59.244
You got family there?

38:01.259 --> 38:02.912
- I want to make a deal.
- Yeah?

38:03.628 --> 38:04.664
If I cooperate.

38:05.072 --> 38:06.499
Oh, you're going to cooperate.

38:09.386 --> 38:11.127
Look, I'm not proud of what I did,

38:11.595 --> 38:12.624
but with the...

38:13.156 --> 38:15.259
budget cutbacks and...

38:15.968 --> 38:18.082
looking at my pension, I just...

38:20.591 --> 38:22.014
I figured I deserved more.

38:22.218 --> 38:23.891
And you were willing to kill for it?

38:25.606 --> 38:26.606
Kill?

38:28.373 --> 38:30.897
He actually seems
legitimately surprised.

38:31.181 --> 38:32.181
He does.

38:32.609 --> 38:34.275
What exactly am I under arrest for?

38:35.000 --> 38:37.196
- I haven't placed you under arrest.
- And when you do?

38:42.470 --> 38:44.124
- Oh, my God.
- Murder.

38:44.390 --> 38:45.968
Conspiracy to defraud.

38:46.543 --> 38:48.159
Throw in medical malpractice.

38:49.477 --> 38:50.845
This is a mistake. I...

38:51.204 --> 38:52.211
So cooperate.

38:53.459 --> 38:55.838
- Who's your buyer?
- My buyer?

38:56.329 --> 38:59.677
I know you're selling
the research from Tarburst's program.

39:00.671 --> 39:02.818
I'm not selling anything
from the program.

39:03.937 --> 39:06.893
- Why were you running?
- Because I was embezzling from it.

39:11.057 --> 39:13.983
I was running because Abby succeed.

39:14.677 --> 39:16.068
That would mean a GAO audit.

39:16.454 --> 39:19.474
It would uncover what I did.
I planned to be long gone before then.

39:19.534 --> 39:20.990
I just didn't plan it so soon.

39:24.782 --> 39:27.620
I have records, I could prove it.
I don't know anything

39:27.702 --> 39:29.181
- about a conspiracy.
- Liar!

39:30.711 --> 39:31.644
Sorry, Gibbs.

39:31.704 --> 39:34.210
You set up the lab
so you could sell my research!

39:34.293 --> 39:36.963
I did not set up the lab.
I don't know who did set up the lab.

39:37.044 --> 39:39.021
I was ordered to run the lab,
that's what I did.

39:39.081 --> 39:41.677
Sergeant King didn't get the help
he need because

39:41.757 --> 39:44.013
you falsified his medical records.

39:44.891 --> 39:45.891
Who?

39:48.141 --> 39:49.846
You don't even know his name.

39:50.764 --> 39:52.645
Sergeant Robert...

39:52.845 --> 39:53.845
King.

39:54.628 --> 39:56.734
He's one of the patients
in your program.

39:57.394 --> 40:00.032
I know everyone's name
in that program.

40:00.092 --> 40:02.110
There is no Sergeant King.

40:12.221 --> 40:13.221
Find him.

40:29.227 --> 40:31.352
You look pretty good for a dead guy,

40:31.433 --> 40:33.479
except for the blood draining
out of your face.

40:33.709 --> 40:35.521
Tom, right?

40:35.834 --> 40:37.716
That's your real name, isn't it?

40:39.201 --> 40:40.319
What did I do wrong?

40:42.542 --> 40:44.297
You made me care about you.

40:45.652 --> 40:49.203
You're under arrest for the murder
of Nurse Hannah Dunstan.

40:49.284 --> 40:52.456
That is correct, and many, many more bad
things, because you're a very bad man.

40:52.870 --> 40:55.918
Little tip: Next time you're playing
chess with a forensic specialist...

40:56.397 --> 40:58.593
- Wear gloves.
- And try to find better help.

40:58.653 --> 41:00.047
Your little buddy, PFC Riggs,

41:00.384 --> 41:02.633
was sending you unencrypted e-mails.

41:03.093 --> 41:05.259
Might as well put a big bull's-eye
on your laptop.

41:08.898 --> 41:09.898
Why?

41:11.196 --> 41:13.355
Kept you from asking
too many questions.

41:14.236 --> 41:16.140
And I like to stay close
when I'm running an op.

41:16.200 --> 41:17.200
An op?

41:18.033 --> 41:20.234
Op... is that what you call
betraying your country?

41:20.701 --> 41:22.610
You have no idea
what I've done for my country.

41:22.693 --> 41:24.320
Yeah, I do. I read your file.

41:24.648 --> 41:27.482
You're the go-to guy
for setting up black ops, right?

41:28.334 --> 41:31.452
Specialty was bioweapons
defense research.

41:32.023 --> 41:34.444
Figured it was time to branch out,
do a little freelancing?

41:34.504 --> 41:36.824
Like I said,
I'm a man of contradictions.

41:40.877 --> 41:42.319
All right, here we go.

41:42.593 --> 41:43.593
Is that it?

41:45.936 --> 41:47.386
That all you have to say?

41:50.590 --> 41:51.590
Checkmate.

42:01.265 --> 42:02.959
Thought she wasn't coming in.

42:03.019 --> 42:04.019
Neither did I.

42:04.830 --> 42:07.947
Vance told her to take a week off.
Maybe she wanted to work.

42:10.181 --> 42:11.753
What are you doing down here?

42:12.527 --> 42:13.855
I don't know. I got...

42:13.915 --> 42:16.593
an e-mail from Gibbs. Told me
to meet him down here in the lab.

42:16.653 --> 42:17.653
So did I.

42:18.752 --> 42:19.752
Probies first.

42:32.652 --> 42:33.652
Come on...

42:33.699 --> 42:35.514
Gibbs doesn't use e-mail.

42:35.957 --> 42:37.291
Hi, guys.

42:47.058 --> 42:48.519
We've been set up.
