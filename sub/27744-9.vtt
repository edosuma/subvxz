[scoffs] Brianna,
what are you wearing to the meeting?

00:54.387 --> 00:57.891
[scoffs] Well, they better be
formal basketball shorts.

-[cell phone chimes]
-Oh.

01:00.727 --> 01:04.647
Uh. It's Nick. Hey, call me
if anything comes up at the hotel, okay?

01:05.315 --> 01:06.566
What's an "upper decker"?

01:07.776 --> 01:10.570
Oh, God, you're disgusting. Bye!

01:12.655 --> 01:14.324
Hey, you.

01:15.033 --> 01:19.079
No, I can't do dinner tonight,
but I can do lunch Thursday.

01:20.163 --> 01:22.290
-Okay. Then let's make it then.
-[phone beeps]

01:22.373 --> 01:24.793
Uh! Oh, I got another call, I got to go.

01:25.585 --> 01:27.170
You, too. Bye.

01:28.713 --> 01:30.131
What, Frankie?

01:30.215 --> 01:32.008
[Frankie] Grace, you were right for once.

01:32.092 --> 01:33.802
Oh, my God,
it's coming from inside the house.

01:33.885 --> 01:35.720
I don't have time for whatever this is.

01:35.804 --> 01:39.015
Excuse me, madame.
Don't you have a moment for Vybrant?

01:39.099 --> 01:42.393
Also, you have to talk to me.
It's in your planner.

01:42.477 --> 01:45.188
[scoffs] You can't go in my planner
and write "Frankie Bergstein"

01:45.271 --> 01:47.065
across Monday to Friday.

01:47.148 --> 01:48.525
Sure can.

01:48.608 --> 01:51.569
You're also scheduled
for a big kiss on the mouth later.

01:51.653 --> 01:52.904
[chuckles]

01:52.987 --> 01:56.366
But right now, exciting business talk.

01:56.449 --> 01:58.535
Oh, it sounds like just more work for me.

01:58.618 --> 02:00.703
I don't have time for more work for me.

02:00.787 --> 02:03.414
No, doy. That's why you've got me.

[clears throat]

02:04.791 --> 02:08.711
The Ménage à Moi was only halfway
to the moon, so why did we stop--

02:08.795 --> 02:11.422
Frankie, please,
no more half-baked ideas.

02:11.506 --> 02:13.216
Fresh-baked.

02:13.299 --> 02:14.968
Really plump and fluffy.

02:15.051 --> 02:18.930
I need help with the flat, unleavened
small things that have to get done.

02:19.013 --> 02:20.974
Well, I'm more a big idea person.

02:21.057 --> 02:24.477
Like my idea for hands that come out
of the wall to rub your shoulders.

02:24.561 --> 02:26.229
Whose hands, you might wonder?

02:26.312 --> 02:29.399
Well, here's where it gets
really exciting--

02:29.482 --> 02:30.567
Yeah, Frankie!

02:31.192 --> 02:33.528
Fine, let's sit down and put together

02:33.611 --> 02:35.697
-a list of the small stuff.
-[Grace] Oh, here.

02:39.450 --> 02:40.285
Bye.

02:41.244 --> 02:42.537
[door opens]

02:43.872 --> 02:45.707
-We're out of toilet paper.
-[door closes]

02:47.876 --> 02:50.211
Why do we give him
a ride to school every day?

02:50.295 --> 02:52.797
-Because he works there.
-I have a name.

02:52.881 --> 02:54.507
Why doesn't he have a car?

02:54.591 --> 02:56.968
Same reason you can't have fireworks.

02:57.051 --> 03:01.097
Mom, my diorama for Mr. DeGara's class
is due tomorrow.

03:01.181 --> 03:03.391
Well, then you better finish it today.

03:04.267 --> 03:07.353
Then someone needs to take me
to the craft store.

03:08.188 --> 03:09.606
Can you even drive?

03:09.689 --> 03:10.607
Can you?

03:10.690 --> 03:13.610
We have all the supplies
you could ever want at home.

03:13.693 --> 03:14.527
Like what?

03:14.611 --> 03:17.322
Like anything you can find. Be creative.

03:17.405 --> 03:19.282
-Not with my stuff.
-Or my stuff.

03:19.365 --> 03:21.910
Use anything that isn't his or his.

03:24.871 --> 03:26.122
Everyone got their lunches?

03:26.206 --> 03:27.457
-[Madison] Yes.
-[Macklin] Yep.

03:27.540 --> 03:28.458
[Coyote] Damn it.

03:29.292 --> 03:31.294
All right, everyone out.

03:33.254 --> 03:37.050
Do you mind swinging around back so
the kids don't see you dropping me off?

03:37.133 --> 03:38.218
Get out.

03:41.554 --> 03:43.681
[school bell rings]

03:44.766 --> 03:48.394
Grace has never before
given me the reins of Vybrant,

03:48.478 --> 03:52.023
so we must treat this
with the utmost seriousness.

03:52.106 --> 03:54.275
No shirking, no procrastinating,

03:54.359 --> 03:56.277
and no reinventing the wheel,

03:56.361 --> 03:58.988
unless, of course,
you have a great new wheel idea.

03:59.614 --> 04:02.575
-[chuckles]
-Now then, onto the first item...

04:02.659 --> 04:05.245
Label and ship packages.

04:05.328 --> 04:07.747
Oh, for Pharrell's sake.

04:07.830 --> 04:11.876
Why can't you just paint two "X"s
on my eyes and bury me at sea?

04:11.960 --> 04:15.505
-I'll just put a "no" next to it, darling.
-[Frankie] No, we can't do that.

04:15.588 --> 04:18.216
But we can put it off till the end
because it sucks.

04:19.425 --> 04:21.761
Now, item number two:

04:21.844 --> 04:23.763
customer service's emails.

04:23.846 --> 04:25.306
I'm on it.

04:25.390 --> 04:28.184
May I use coarse language, if warranted?

04:28.268 --> 04:33.273
You may, and I will start with
what should have been our number one:

04:33.356 --> 04:35.066
fixing the website picture.

04:35.149 --> 04:38.278
-What's wrong with the website picture?
-I'd just done

04:38.361 --> 04:39.904
the Cinnamon Challenge.

04:40.196 --> 04:41.030
Okay.

04:41.739 --> 04:43.283
Oh, this will do.

04:43.366 --> 04:46.911
I will just highlight here and copy

04:46.995 --> 04:49.956
and drag here and all set.

04:50.039 --> 04:53.084
God, there are so many
customer service emails.

04:53.167 --> 04:55.712
-Oh, our customers love us!
-Not today, dear.

04:55.795 --> 04:59.590
They can't find the website anymore
and no one can order anything.

04:59.674 --> 05:00.883
You know, it's very sad,

05:00.967 --> 05:04.887
some older folks just don't always know
how to use the Internet.

05:05.388 --> 05:08.599
Let me just go to our website and--

05:08.683 --> 05:09.517
[ding]

05:09.600 --> 05:13.146
What happened? Something's wrong
with my computer. Try yours.

-[keyboard clacking]
-[ding]

05:14.897 --> 05:16.774
It won't come up on mine either.

05:16.858 --> 05:20.987
Okay, not time to panic yet.
Maybe the whole Internet is down.

05:21.070 --> 05:23.948
Quick, search "funny elephant videos."

05:24.032 --> 05:25.575
See if anything comes up.

05:26.200 --> 05:28.328
Eight million results.

05:28.411 --> 05:29.287
Eight?!

05:29.370 --> 05:31.289
Oh, that's more than last time--

05:31.372 --> 05:33.166
No! I mustn't.

05:33.249 --> 05:34.584
Um...

05:34.667 --> 05:36.461
We need to fix what we broke.

05:36.544 --> 05:37.920
How do I undo this?

05:38.004 --> 05:39.756
I'll try undo.

05:40.631 --> 05:41.883
-Undo.

[Frankie] Grace is gonna kill me.

06:01.444 --> 06:02.528
-Foot.

06:03.154 --> 06:04.447
-Oh, you good boy.
-Hi.

06:04.530 --> 06:05.656
Oh, hi.

06:05.740 --> 06:07.325
Another bad rehearsal?

06:07.867 --> 06:09.535
Peter certainly thought so.

06:09.619 --> 06:11.996
Unless "you all suck"
has a double meaning.

06:12.080 --> 06:15.375
Well, I know something
that will cheer you up.

06:15.958 --> 06:20.129
I finally stood up to Ozzy
at Ozzy's Dry Cleaners.

06:20.213 --> 06:21.756
[Robert] You did? That's great.

06:22.882 --> 06:24.759
I know.

06:24.842 --> 06:27.178
I demanded to be accommodated

06:27.261 --> 06:29.597
-and accommodated I was.
-So...

06:29.680 --> 06:33.184
We are now the proud owners
of a stack of "free shirt-clean" coupons.

06:33.267 --> 06:36.270
-That's very good, Sol, but what will we--
-Excuse me.

06:36.354 --> 06:38.731
You keep interrupting my story.
I'm not finished.

06:38.815 --> 06:41.317
It wasn't over?
The coupons weren't the climax?

06:41.401 --> 06:42.443
No, there's a twist.

06:42.527 --> 06:46.447
The coupons were stuck together,
so we got twice as many.

06:49.784 --> 06:51.202
That's it. I'm done.

06:51.285 --> 06:53.121
Oh. Well, that's great.

06:53.204 --> 06:55.915
Sounds like you had a very successful day.

06:55.998 --> 06:57.417
What are we doing for dinner?

06:57.500 --> 06:59.836
I don't know.
I hadn't even thought about it.

06:59.919 --> 07:01.462
Is there another story?

07:01.546 --> 07:04.215
Nope, just the great one I told you.

07:04.298 --> 07:05.758
So, what are we doing for dinner?

07:05.842 --> 07:07.677
Why do you assume
that I took care of dinner?

07:07.760 --> 07:11.472
Because you're the one who's home now
and you always take care of dinner.

07:11.556 --> 07:15.643
Well, now sometimes I'm raising hell
at the dry cleaners,

07:15.726 --> 07:18.438
and I don't always do anything.

07:22.358 --> 07:23.401
Come on, Carl.

07:24.735 --> 07:26.779
You're lucky I had two lunches!

07:28.156 --> 07:30.324
[sighs] We could stay
until the crack of dawn

07:30.408 --> 07:32.994
or let Brianna deal with this
when she gets back.

07:33.077 --> 07:35.079
What's our excuse for not getting it done?

07:35.163 --> 07:37.457
Uh, you're old and I'm not getting paid?

07:37.540 --> 07:40.251
-You're not getting paid?
-You are?

07:40.960 --> 07:42.044
No, we-- We need to finish.

07:42.128 --> 07:44.755
We can't put it off till tomorrow.
There'll just be more.

07:44.839 --> 07:47.633
-[sighs] I have kids.
-Yeah, so do I.

07:47.717 --> 07:49.469
That's why I'm in this mess.

07:49.552 --> 07:50.636
Ahoy, mateys.

07:50.720 --> 07:53.306
Oh, God. What are you two here for?

07:53.389 --> 07:55.016
Just wanted to talk to you

07:55.099 --> 07:58.144
some place where you couldn't be
loud and violent...

07:58.227 --> 07:59.145
matey.

07:59.687 --> 08:00.855
What did you do?

08:00.938 --> 08:05.568
Actually, it was while doing some
extra credit on our homepage, I found--

08:05.651 --> 08:07.653
Are you obsessing
about that picture again?

08:07.737 --> 08:10.656
It's a bad picture of me and you know it!

08:10.740 --> 08:13.534
Well, you wouldn't stop
eating all the cinnamon!

08:14.035 --> 08:15.203
-Oh, I can just--
-Uh...

08:15.995 --> 08:18.539
-Okay. You got it.
-So what am I about to yell at you for?

08:18.623 --> 08:20.082
No biggie.

08:20.166 --> 08:22.502
Our website disappeared
from the Internet...

08:22.585 --> 08:25.213
which is space, I think.

08:25.296 --> 08:28.090
What? How does that even happen?

08:28.174 --> 08:29.759
Oh, how does anything happen?

08:30.176 --> 08:33.137
Oh, it looks like one of you
forgot to pay the domain lease.

08:33.221 --> 08:35.389
I don't know what that is,
so it couldn't be me.

08:35.473 --> 08:36.432
I paid it!

08:36.516 --> 08:38.142
Uh... not last month.

08:38.226 --> 08:41.354
Or the month before that.
Or the month before that.

08:41.437 --> 08:43.439
Isn't this delicious?

08:43.940 --> 08:46.567
Little Miss Incredible... falters

08:46.651 --> 08:50.238
and leaves the Madwoman of La Jolla
to pick up the pieces.

08:50.321 --> 08:53.574
You never pay your bills on time
and you manage.

08:53.658 --> 08:56.118
I'll pay what's outstanding.
Everything's gonna be fine.

08:56.202 --> 08:58.829
Actually, when you didn't pay,
the website became available for purchase

08:58.913 --> 09:01.791
and someone bought it.

09:01.874 --> 09:03.626
Who would want our website?

09:03.709 --> 09:06.963
Someone who wants to sell it back to you
for more money. Happens all the time.

09:07.046 --> 09:10.424
Oh, it's true.
I used to be in the domain-name game,

09:10.508 --> 09:14.262
until I lost Cars-dot-com
in a vicious bridge tournament.

09:14.345 --> 09:17.974
So, we just need to find
whatever Internet nerd did this

09:18.057 --> 09:20.351
and cut them a check.
[snaps fingers]

09:21.519 --> 09:27.400
Well, apparently the Internet nerd's
name is Howard Kassembaum.

09:27.483 --> 09:28.901
Who the hell is Howard Kassembaum?

09:28.985 --> 09:31.404
Howard from Walden Villas.

09:31.487 --> 09:32.321
You know him.

09:32.405 --> 09:34.198
-The food toucher with the walker.
-[sighs]

09:34.282 --> 09:37.618
I caught him once with a fist
in the Thousand Island.

09:38.202 --> 09:39.912
He stole our website?

09:39.996 --> 09:43.165
If you want, I know a guy
who can break his food-touchers.

09:43.249 --> 09:47.086
But one of you has to phone him.
He thinks I'm dead.

09:47.169 --> 09:49.505
[school bell rings]

09:49.589 --> 09:51.757
[overlapping chatter]

09:54.343 --> 09:56.178
[Madison] Coyote,
come see my diorama I made.

09:56.262 --> 09:58.097
Uh... I'm kind of late for the--

09:58.180 --> 09:59.640
Come on! Come on! Come on!

10:01.601 --> 10:02.768
Okay.

10:03.728 --> 10:05.938
-Which one's yours?
-That one.

10:07.273 --> 10:11.736
Wow, Madison.
That<i> Secret Garden</i> is really good.

10:16.407 --> 10:17.241
Oh, wow.

10:17.325 --> 10:19.118
Oh... wow.

10:21.454 --> 10:23.956
-Has your mom seen this?
-Nope.

10:24.040 --> 10:25.291
Okay.

10:25.916 --> 10:27.126
Cool.

10:27.752 --> 10:31.422
Where did you get the fancy fence posts?

10:31.505 --> 10:33.257
From Mommy's secret cabinet.

10:34.467 --> 10:35.468
Awesome.

10:35.551 --> 10:37.553
-[crickets chirping]
-[dog barking]

10:38.137 --> 10:42.350
Last night's drama is not something
I want to relive either.

10:44.393 --> 10:46.187
I really hope you like this.

10:49.440 --> 10:55.696
I put in extra eggs and sardines
for a shiny coat.

10:59.116 --> 11:00.117
Sit.

11:01.410 --> 11:02.703
Down.

11:02.787 --> 11:04.080
Leave it.

11:13.714 --> 11:14.757
Okay!

11:17.343 --> 11:20.346
[cell phone chiming]

11:25.935 --> 11:27.395
-Hey, Bud.
-Hey, Dad.

11:27.478 --> 11:30.815
First, hells yes, I'd like
some free shirt-clean coupons.

11:30.898 --> 11:34.110
-That was such a great story.
-I knew that was a great story.

11:34.193 --> 11:37.238
And just wanted to double check
Jeff and Peter got Allison's list

11:37.321 --> 11:39.782
of don'ts and don'ts
for tomorrow's tasting.

11:39.865 --> 11:40.700
[Sol]<i> They sure did!</i>

11:40.783 --> 11:44.161
Jeff wants to know
if caviar counts as eggs,

11:44.245 --> 11:46.622
and Peter wants to know
if she's fucking kidding.

11:55.881 --> 11:58.300
[Sol] I don't want any problems.

11:58.384 --> 12:00.803
He couldn't cater your law firm events.

12:01.137 --> 12:03.347
-Well, he doesn't know that.
-[sniffs]

12:03.848 --> 12:05.599
You can call him if you want.

12:05.725 --> 12:06.767
-[slurps]
-Do it.

12:12.898 --> 12:15.901
Okay. See you both tomorrow. Bye.

12:18.696 --> 12:19.739
Oh.

12:20.239 --> 12:21.365
Robert, you're eating that.

12:21.449 --> 12:23.492
I know. I'm sorry. I should've waited.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.703
-No, it's not that--
-I'm sorry about yesterday.

12:25.786 --> 12:29.457
It was childish to take
my theater frustrations out on you.

12:29.540 --> 12:34.086
This was so nice and not assumed
and not expected in any way,

12:34.170 --> 12:36.213
but I definitely still appreciate it.

12:36.297 --> 12:38.257
-Thank you.
-You're eating dog food.

12:50.478 --> 12:52.396
Why haven't you been
answering your phone?

12:53.230 --> 12:54.732
Shit. My phone was on vibrate.

12:54.815 --> 12:58.027
-Why? What's wrong?
-I don't know how to tell you this,

12:58.110 --> 13:02.072
but Madison's
<i>Little House on the Prairie</i> diorama

13:02.156 --> 13:04.992
has a fence posts made out of joints.

13:05.075 --> 13:06.035
[gasps]

13:06.118 --> 13:09.163
Oh, no. Oh, no.

13:09.246 --> 13:11.832
Since when do you
have weed in the house?

13:11.916 --> 13:14.168
Brianna gave me some, but I-- I hid it.

13:14.251 --> 13:16.921
That's good, 'cause kids never look
for things that are hidden.

13:17.004 --> 13:18.839
Why didn't you take them out?

13:18.923 --> 13:22.384
Because the case was locked
and they still won't give me any keys.

13:22.468 --> 13:24.261
[cell phone vibrating]

13:24.345 --> 13:26.013
Shit, it's the school.

13:26.096 --> 13:28.641
Oh, hey, um,
when you're in the principal's office,

13:28.724 --> 13:30.142
say good things about me.

13:30.851 --> 13:32.353
Just if it comes up.

13:36.148 --> 13:37.274
Hello?

13:38.984 --> 13:42.822
Okay, this is my mistake. I'll fix it.
You follow my lead.

13:42.905 --> 13:45.282
I know. Good cop, bad cop.

13:45.366 --> 13:48.077
[scoffs] No. I am all the cops.

13:48.160 --> 13:50.162
You're a civilian ride-along.

13:50.955 --> 13:53.249
[Howard] Either come in or go away!

13:54.667 --> 13:55.626
[doorknob clicks]

13:58.170 --> 14:00.297
[Grace clears throat, inhales]

14:02.716 --> 14:07.137
Well, lookie, who's here.

14:07.763 --> 14:11.141
I thought they threw the two of you
out of this place.

14:11.225 --> 14:13.352
They didn't throw us out. We broke out.

14:13.435 --> 14:15.229
And now, technically, we're banned.

14:15.312 --> 14:17.022
Hey, ride-along, zip it.

14:17.898 --> 14:19.942
What will it cost
to get our domain back?

14:20.025 --> 14:23.445
I really have the two of you
over a barrel.

14:23.529 --> 14:26.115
Well, he's got us there.
We need our website back

14:26.198 --> 14:27.783
-and we'll pay anything for it.
-[scoffs]

14:27.867 --> 14:31.036
I'm starting to get why you paid
so much for your car. [sighs]

14:31.453 --> 14:33.080
How much do you want?

14:33.163 --> 14:35.499
Well, I could ask you for anything.

14:35.583 --> 14:38.210
A company's not a company
without a website.

14:38.294 --> 14:42.047
[Grace] Howard, I will tie you up
in lawsuits for the rest of time.

14:42.131 --> 14:43.299
[Howard] Time.

14:43.924 --> 14:46.802
There's not so much of that ahead,
is there?

14:47.511 --> 14:48.929
Be my guest!

14:50.097 --> 14:53.100
-Maybe we should stay and have some tea.
-[scoffs]

14:53.183 --> 14:56.186
I don't have time to have tea
with this tuft of ear hair.

14:56.270 --> 14:58.230
If you want tea,
make it yourself!

14:58.314 --> 15:00.149
-You got it!
-[groans softly]

15:00.232 --> 15:01.734
Do you trust me?

15:01.817 --> 15:04.320
Situationally, yes.

15:04.403 --> 15:06.322
Then trust me in this situation.

15:06.405 --> 15:08.365
Give me 15 minutes with this guy.

15:08.449 --> 15:10.910
Go visit Arlene. I'll be right there.

15:11.493 --> 15:12.536
Fine.

15:13.162 --> 15:16.999
Look, I know things can't get worse,
but please, don't find a way.

15:17.082 --> 15:19.168
Life always finds a way.

15:19.793 --> 15:21.003
[scoffs]

15:23.839 --> 15:26.717
A li'l girl bringing pot to school
is bad, but it isn't Madison's fault.

15:26.800 --> 15:29.637
The weed isn't hers. It's mine,
'cause I'm stressed out right now,

15:29.720 --> 15:32.514
but I didn't have any
before my daughter used it in her diorama,

15:32.598 --> 15:35.309
which I should've done for her
like all the other mothers do, so

15:35.392 --> 15:38.270
I also apologize for
the substandard quality of her diorama,

15:38.354 --> 15:40.522
which also makes me a terrible mother.
I'm sorry.

15:40.606 --> 15:43.442
Hi. I'm Madison's mother, Mallory.

15:44.193 --> 15:45.986
Was that one long sentence?

15:46.070 --> 15:48.280
I think so. Yeah.

15:49.156 --> 15:51.533
Wow, um...
[sighs]

15:51.617 --> 15:54.954
Well, I have, uh, one short sentence:

15:55.621 --> 15:56.789
Madison is suspended.

15:56.872 --> 15:58.457
Suspended?

15:58.540 --> 16:00.793
Wait. Do you feel like that's too harsh?

16:00.876 --> 16:04.838
Yes! Isn't suspension for kids
who know they did something wrong?

16:04.922 --> 16:06.757
Madison was just making a fence.

16:06.840 --> 16:08.509
Huh. Uh...

16:09.718 --> 16:11.971
What seems like a fair punishment to you?

16:12.054 --> 16:14.848
Don't know, but if anyone
should be punished it should be me.

16:14.932 --> 16:17.267
Because, apparently,
I'm just that cliché single mom

16:17.351 --> 16:20.312
who doesn't have time
to help her kids with their projects.

16:20.396 --> 16:22.648
Oh, well, I get it. I'm single, too.

16:22.731 --> 16:24.692
At least you didn't help her
with the diorama

16:24.775 --> 16:28.028
'cause these mothers clearly do
all their kid's homework for them.

16:28.112 --> 16:30.280
There was this one diorama
for<i> The Secret Garden</i>

16:30.364 --> 16:32.616
that could've been a float
in the Rose Bowl Parade.

16:32.700 --> 16:34.493
Besides, pot's legal now.
[chuckles]

16:34.576 --> 16:36.662
I mean... [clicks tongue]

16:37.204 --> 16:39.039
Not for kids, but, you know?

16:39.873 --> 16:41.709
Was that all one sentence?

16:42.668 --> 16:43.669
It was.

16:43.752 --> 16:45.546
[chuckles]

16:45.629 --> 16:47.631
Maybe I can make up for this

16:47.715 --> 16:51.552
by coming in and volunteering
for hot lunch on Fridays?

16:52.302 --> 16:54.930
Friday lunch duty is the worst!

16:55.014 --> 16:56.932
I know.

16:57.850 --> 16:59.560
[chuckles] That should work.

16:59.643 --> 17:00.853
Okay.

17:01.437 --> 17:02.896
Oh, uh...

17:03.480 --> 17:06.608
Don't... forget your stash.

17:07.317 --> 17:08.694
[chuckles]

17:08.777 --> 17:09.945
[Mallory] Uh...

17:12.489 --> 17:13.615
[Mallory] Shh.

17:13.782 --> 17:14.908
-It's--
-Uh...

17:14.992 --> 17:17.870
-Yeah, that wasn't glued correctly.
-Umm.

17:17.953 --> 17:20.205
It's so important
for the structural integrity,

17:20.289 --> 17:22.708
and I smoked it last night.
-[inhales]

17:23.000 --> 17:24.960
It was a rough one yesterday.

17:25.961 --> 17:27.254
I understand.

17:29.465 --> 17:32.760
And, of course, as punishment for myself,

17:32.843 --> 17:35.471
I will also be doing hot lunch on Friday.

17:36.638 --> 17:38.974
Well, I guess I will see you there.

17:39.058 --> 17:40.350
I guess you will.

17:42.936 --> 17:45.147
Oh, what a nice surprise!

17:45.230 --> 17:46.440
Can I get you something?

17:46.523 --> 17:49.151
-Oh, God, yes. Coffee, please.
-Oh.

17:49.234 --> 17:52.488
-Well, I think I have some instant...
-[sighs]

17:53.113 --> 17:56.283
...from the person
who lived here before me.

17:56.366 --> 17:58.952
Now where the hell is it?
Ah!

17:59.036 --> 18:00.329
-[chuckles]
-Oh.

18:00.871 --> 18:02.956
-Adderall? Do you take this?
-Oh, no.

18:03.040 --> 18:05.709
Uh... Not anymore.

18:05.793 --> 18:10.589
They tried giving that to me when I first
had my memory problems, but I hated it.

18:11.090 --> 18:12.674
Well, why do you still have it?

18:12.758 --> 18:16.303
Well, all my pharmacy information
is on the bottle. Very handy.

18:16.386 --> 18:20.599
Oh, yeah. I think my grandson,
what's-his-name, takes that.

18:20.682 --> 18:24.728
It's terrible.
It kept me up for two days straight.

18:24.812 --> 18:26.146
That doesn't sound so bad.

18:26.230 --> 18:27.397
Wh-- Ugh.

18:27.481 --> 18:29.733
Last week,
I fell asleep at dinner with Nick.

18:29.817 --> 18:33.320
I mean, he was so sweet about it,
[whispers] but I felt horrible.

18:33.403 --> 18:35.030
The waiter thought I was dead.

18:35.114 --> 18:36.198
[chuckles]

18:37.199 --> 18:39.576
Oh, my God!
I'm supposed to have lunch with Nick.

18:39.660 --> 18:42.246
[gasps] Five minutes ago!
I forgot to cancel.

18:42.329 --> 18:45.207
Well... uh... uh... blame it on me.

18:45.290 --> 18:47.251
Uh... uh... Tell him I fell.

18:47.334 --> 18:49.128
Uh, tell him I died.

18:49.211 --> 18:51.880
Oh, no, leave me out of it.

18:54.883 --> 18:59.471
You got about five minutes before
I take my pants off and watch<i> The View.</i>

18:59.555 --> 19:01.014
You and me both, pal.

19:01.098 --> 19:02.432
What are you looking for?

19:02.516 --> 19:05.060
I'm looking for what this case
is really about,

19:05.144 --> 19:06.937
because it's not about money.

19:07.020 --> 19:08.355
This is a case?

19:09.648 --> 19:11.024
Yes, Howard.

19:11.108 --> 19:16.321
You see, I'm an amateur sleuth
with a degree in detectorology.

19:16.405 --> 19:17.614
Observe.

19:17.698 --> 19:19.616
That's a cross on the wall.

19:19.700 --> 19:21.535
It can mean only one thing:

19:21.618 --> 19:23.787
you are a religious freak

19:23.871 --> 19:28.083
who can't stand the thought
of older people pleasuring themselves.

19:28.167 --> 19:29.918
It's a "T" for Texas.

19:30.460 --> 19:31.295
Ah-ha.

19:31.378 --> 19:37.176
So, it's about a love you had once
as a young man in Texas.

19:37.259 --> 19:38.427
I got it on vacation.

19:38.510 --> 19:42.890
Ah-ha. So, it was on vacation, years ago,

19:42.973 --> 19:44.933
when you were forever hurt

19:45.017 --> 19:47.769
by a woman named... Vybrant!

19:48.145 --> 19:51.773
[stuttering]
you know, you stealing that golf cart

19:51.857 --> 19:54.568
is really starting to make sense to me.

19:54.651 --> 19:57.112
-[beep]
-Oh, our tea's ready!

19:57.196 --> 19:58.238
[Howard chuckles]

20:00.324 --> 20:02.451
So it's the first time
we've ever cooked something

20:02.534 --> 20:05.370
under the supervision of a doctor,
but here goes...

20:05.454 --> 20:07.372
[Allison] Don't worry. I came prepared.

20:08.207 --> 20:09.124
Oh!

20:09.875 --> 20:11.418
-Hmm.
-You won't need EpiPens

20:11.501 --> 20:14.630
'cause I'm sure Jeff and Peter
understood how serious your allergies are.

20:14.713 --> 20:16.340
Mm-hmm.

20:16.423 --> 20:18.800
Because adult allergies are real.

20:18.884 --> 20:23.138
Ah! This is a tasting, Robert,
not a casino buffet line.

20:23.222 --> 20:27.017
Oh, great,
more things that aren't my dinner.

20:27.100 --> 20:29.102
You're like a gay Ralph Kramden.

20:29.186 --> 20:34.566
Uh, here we have a homemade ube chip
with line-caught Skipjack

20:34.650 --> 20:37.194
and an activated charcoal glaze.

20:37.277 --> 20:40.364
-Ooh. Hello.
-What type of oil is in that ube chip?

20:40.447 --> 20:43.075
Oh, I think it's...

20:43.158 --> 20:45.410
We didn't use oil in these.

20:45.494 --> 20:47.454
You should skip that one,
to be safe.

20:47.537 --> 20:49.623
You sure? They're delicious.

20:49.706 --> 20:51.667
Robert, she's passing on it.

20:51.750 --> 20:54.461
Don't bulldoze her into something
she doesn't wanna eat.

20:54.544 --> 20:56.463
No, it's okay. I'll try it.

20:56.546 --> 20:59.716
Let's be honest, at some point tonight,
one of you will stab me with a pen.

20:59.800 --> 21:02.427
Nobody's going to be
stabbing anyone with anything.

21:02.511 --> 21:03.595
We'll see.

21:03.679 --> 21:06.515
But they're not even sure
what type of oil they used.

21:06.598 --> 21:10.894
Sol, would you please let the food experts
handle the tasting?

21:10.978 --> 21:13.522
Okay, but we're having a tasting

21:13.605 --> 21:15.482
with someone whose allergies

21:15.565 --> 21:18.694
were documented
in<i> The New England Journal of Medicine.</i>

21:18.777 --> 21:20.070
-July 2012.
-The cover.

21:20.153 --> 21:21.822
It was the cover.

21:21.905 --> 21:26.285
So, forgive me if I'm a little protective
of the mother of my granddaughter.

21:26.368 --> 21:27.911
She's not eating that.

21:27.995 --> 21:29.162
So next.

21:29.246 --> 21:30.664
Guess this is my dinner.

21:30.747 --> 21:33.333
Oh, yes, Robert,
as long as you get your dinner.

21:33.417 --> 21:35.502
Guys, can something
that's supposed to be about me

21:35.585 --> 21:37.879
actually be about me for once?

21:37.963 --> 21:39.089
And Allison.

21:39.172 --> 21:41.800
This is about me and Allison.
Mostly Allison.

21:41.883 --> 21:46.263
You wanted a tasting? This is a taste
of what a real marriage is like!

21:46.346 --> 21:48.724
We did use oil! Sunflower oil!

21:48.807 --> 21:50.017
I can't have that.

21:50.100 --> 21:52.060
-They're past it now, dear.
-Well--

21:52.144 --> 21:53.979
Robert's just acting childish

21:54.062 --> 21:57.774
because I didn't make his dinner
two nights in a row.

21:57.858 --> 21:59.860
It's not because
you didn't make my dinner.

21:59.943 --> 22:02.321
It's because you changed
the rules about dinner

22:02.404 --> 22:04.072
without even talking to me about it.

22:04.156 --> 22:06.908
You admitted you were taking
your frustrations out on me.

22:06.992 --> 22:09.786
I said 'cause I thought
you'd made me an apology dinner!

22:09.870 --> 22:13.498
And why would I do that?
I have nothing to apologize for!

22:13.582 --> 22:15.083
This does not seem to be ending.

22:15.167 --> 22:17.002
Like when you explain<i> Star Wars.</i>

22:17.502 --> 22:18.337
Shall we?

22:18.420 --> 22:20.172
We could come back another day.

22:20.255 --> 22:23.467
You'd have to pay us all over again,
but we'd be happy to come back.

22:23.550 --> 22:26.011
Do you accept dry-cleaner coupons?

22:26.094 --> 22:27.471
You got more coupons?

22:28.013 --> 22:31.350
Everyone wants the coupons.
No one's willing to work for 'em.

22:31.433 --> 22:34.436
What is going on with you?
You've been impossible lately.

22:34.519 --> 22:36.980
I'm not impossible. I'm just evolving,

22:37.064 --> 22:38.565
and I like the new me.

22:38.648 --> 22:40.609
The new me gets results.

22:40.692 --> 22:44.363
Sol, it's not like you were exactly
a wallflower to begin with.

22:44.446 --> 22:47.741
I've wasted a lot of time
going along with what you wanted...

22:47.824 --> 22:49.576
or what Frankie wanted.

22:49.659 --> 22:51.411
I don't want to do it anymore.

22:51.495 --> 22:55.207
Can't you do that and still act
like the same old, sweet Sol?

22:55.290 --> 22:57.709
-I kind of like the bitchy Sol.
-[Robert sighs]

22:57.793 --> 23:00.879
Jeff, thanks for enjoying my many facets.

23:00.962 --> 23:03.090
[Allison] Mm. What's in the slow cooker?

23:03.173 --> 23:06.385
It is delicious. Mm. Mm. Mm.

23:07.052 --> 23:10.764
I always think of you
as my friend who does it all,

23:10.847 --> 23:11.890
[chuckles]

23:12.391 --> 23:14.935
but do you think maybe
you're doing too much?

23:15.018 --> 23:16.144
Yeah, I know.

23:16.228 --> 23:17.979
I don't know what to do about it.

23:18.063 --> 23:19.564
You could choose not to do it.

23:20.232 --> 23:22.025
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

23:22.109 --> 23:24.361
You could do less
of what you're doing now.

23:24.444 --> 23:26.071
You're really not being clear.

23:26.154 --> 23:27.823
[chuckles softly, clicks tongue]

23:28.365 --> 23:30.325
Uh, you know what I did today?

23:30.409 --> 23:32.702
I had breakfast and then you came over.

23:32.786 --> 23:36.164
Oh, that sounds so luxurious.
[laughs]

23:36.248 --> 23:38.792
Tell me more about what you don't do.

23:38.875 --> 23:43.213
Well, uh, I don't do anything
between lunch and my afternoon walk.

23:43.296 --> 23:44.840
Ah.

23:44.923 --> 23:46.842
And after my walk, it's a nap.

23:46.925 --> 23:50.303
And then my day really clears up.
[chuckles]

23:50.387 --> 23:52.722
Unless I have plans with Don.

23:52.806 --> 23:55.308
-Don?
-Mm.

23:55.809 --> 23:57.144
My new beau.
[sighs]

23:57.227 --> 24:00.272
Now there's a guy who loves to do nothing.

24:00.355 --> 24:02.816
We're planning a trip to Barbados

24:02.899 --> 24:04.985
and we're not gonna do it all.

24:05.569 --> 24:09.489
Nick wants to go away, too,
but who has the time?

24:10.157 --> 24:14.744
Honestly, at our age,
who has the time not to?

24:18.665 --> 24:21.293
Hmm. Nice photos.

24:21.376 --> 24:23.503
Meh. I don't love travelling.

24:23.587 --> 24:26.381
-Seems like you did at one point.
-Hmm.

24:26.465 --> 24:29.718
Just like you used to like
to go to the cafeteria.

24:29.801 --> 24:34.222
But those trays tell me
that you now eat your meals alone.

24:34.681 --> 24:37.976
Perhaps because
you've gone from a walker...

24:38.560 --> 24:40.061
to this wheelchair!

24:40.145 --> 24:41.730
Hey, I was drying that.

24:41.813 --> 24:43.190
Sorry.

24:44.733 --> 24:47.861
Looks like someone's
been hitting this button a lot.

24:47.944 --> 24:48.987
So what?

24:49.070 --> 24:51.656
As much as I, too, hear the siren song

24:51.740 --> 24:54.242
-of the un-pushed button...
-Yeah.

24:54.326 --> 24:59.247
...I think you stole our domain name
so that this would happen.

24:59.331 --> 25:03.376
So you'd act crazy
and spill hot water all over my kitchen?

25:05.003 --> 25:10.342
You know, Howard, I knew a guy once
who was a lot like you.

25:10.425 --> 25:11.301
[scoffs]

25:11.384 --> 25:16.139
He took people on a three-hour tour,
deliberately crashed his boat.

25:16.223 --> 25:17.807
He sounds like a jerk.

25:17.891 --> 25:21.102
No, he was just a little lonely.

25:22.145 --> 25:25.315
You don't have to crash a boat
or steal a website

25:25.398 --> 25:28.693
-to get someone to hang out with you.
-[Howard] Says you.

25:28.777 --> 25:30.195
You got a partner,

25:30.862 --> 25:32.197
a friend,

25:32.280 --> 25:33.865
or whatever else she is.

25:33.949 --> 25:34.991
Wife.

25:35.075 --> 25:36.952
I had one of those.

25:37.035 --> 25:38.119
Yeah? Tell me about her.

25:38.203 --> 25:39.371
She was awful.

25:40.163 --> 25:42.415
We were married 57 years.

25:42.499 --> 25:44.167
Sounds like you were lucky.

25:44.251 --> 25:48.421
Look at me. I won the lottery.

25:48.505 --> 25:50.090
[chuckles]

25:53.927 --> 25:57.514
So, there I was, back against the wall,
facing Howard down,

25:57.597 --> 26:00.183
alone without anyone to guard my flank--

26:00.267 --> 26:02.978
-Arlene, have you seen<i> Dunkirk?</i>
-I have not.

26:03.061 --> 26:07.315
Oh, it'd be so much easier to explain
what happened if you've seen it.

26:07.399 --> 26:10.110
-You wanna watch it?
-Did you get our domain name back?

26:10.193 --> 26:11.987
Oh, sorry, buried the lede.

26:12.070 --> 26:14.281
Yes. And you know what that means?

26:14.364 --> 26:16.324
You'll have to listen
to all my new ideas!

26:16.408 --> 26:17.909
Let's schedule a meeting.

26:17.993 --> 26:20.453
Block off a good three to seven hours.

26:20.537 --> 26:21.913
That'll be the pre-meeting.

26:21.997 --> 26:24.749
Oh, my God.
I regret everything I have ever done.

26:24.833 --> 26:27.669
So, Arlene, where was I?<i> Dunkirk.</i>
Never seen it.

26:27.752 --> 26:28.878
[Grace] Yes, you have!

26:30.046 --> 26:31.423
Did I like it?

26:33.091 --> 26:34.718
[Frankie] So, all he wanted was a friend.

26:34.801 --> 26:37.971
Someone to talk to
and pay attention to him.

26:38.054 --> 26:39.222
Oh.

26:39.306 --> 26:42.100
That's good. I thought you
were gonna make him our CEO.

26:42.183 --> 26:44.561
No, I made him our IT guy.

26:44.644 --> 26:47.022
[scoffs] We don't need an IT guy.

26:47.105 --> 26:50.734
Sometimes you hire an IT guy
'cause he needs you.

26:50.817 --> 26:53.778
-You don't, but I get your point.
-Hmm.

26:54.279 --> 26:57.490
Well, congratulations, Frankie.
You cracked the case.

26:57.574 --> 26:59.618
Cheese and rice, I surely did.

26:59.701 --> 27:04.789
All right. Let's go to Dave & Buster's
and do Fireball shots.

27:04.873 --> 27:07.626
Gosh, horrible as that sounds...

27:07.709 --> 27:09.628
-[laughs]
-we have work to do.

27:10.128 --> 27:12.255
Oh, God, I've got to call Mallory.

27:13.757 --> 27:15.675
And I really should see Nick.

27:18.595 --> 27:19.429
Um...

27:19.512 --> 27:21.681
-Would you pass me that water over there?
-Hmm.
