WEBVTT

02:12.257 --> 02:13.591
That's it.

03:28.750 --> 03:30.751
The tide's against us.

03:30.836 --> 03:32.169
Aye, but we have the wind.

03:32.671 --> 03:35.381
She'll blow us straight to the gates.

03:35.465 --> 03:36.549
You're coming home.

03:36.633 --> 03:39.552
King's Landing hasn't been home
for 20 years.

03:41.013 --> 03:44.765
I spent most of my life dodging the royal fleet.

03:46.894 --> 03:49.186
And now I'm sailing right at them.

03:49.479 --> 03:51.439
This is the royal fleet.

03:51.690 --> 03:53.441
And you're not a smuggler anymore,
you're the high captain.

03:53.525 --> 03:56.694
Of course, there are...
several royal fleets at the moment.

03:56.778 --> 03:57.820
Not after tonight.

03:58.780 --> 04:01.616
When the sun rises,
Stannis will sit on the Iron Throne

04:01.700 --> 04:03.159
and you will be his Hand.

04:03.243 --> 04:04.994
- Gods be good.
- God.

04:05.454 --> 04:07.246
Father, there is only one
and he watches over us.

04:07.331 --> 04:09.498
- But not over them?
- Over all of us.

04:10.208 --> 04:13.544
The people of King's Landing did not
choose the false king, Joffrey Baratheon.

04:14.504 --> 04:16.047
They will be glad to see his head on a spike.

04:16.339 --> 04:18.798
Well, first, we have to put it there.

04:19.468 --> 04:21.719
Our ships outnumber theirs 10-to-1.

04:21.803 --> 04:23.471
Our army outnumber theirs 5-to-1.

04:24.222 --> 04:25.765
Those walls have never been breached,

04:26.642 --> 04:27.975
and the men guarding the walls,

04:28.060 --> 04:31.187
when they see you, they don't see a liberator,

04:31.271 --> 04:34.273
they see a stranger come
to set their city on fire.

04:35.025 --> 04:37.109
I have faith in the Lord of Light.

04:37.194 --> 04:39.236
I have faith in our cause.

04:40.781 --> 04:42.031
And I have faith in my captain.

05:17.109 --> 05:19.068
Are you afraid, my lion?

05:23.824 --> 05:27.827
If the city falls, Stannis will
burn every Lannister he can find.

05:30.247 --> 05:32.081
Of course I'm afraid.

05:35.127 --> 05:37.169
I won't let them hurt you.

05:41.883 --> 05:43.467
I'm a Lannister.

05:43.844 --> 05:46.262
I don't have a choice in all this.

05:47.723 --> 05:49.598
But it's not your war.

05:56.064 --> 05:57.273
It is now.

06:02.362 --> 06:04.488
You can't fuck your way out of everything.

06:06.408 --> 06:07.658
I have so far.

06:11.288 --> 06:13.956
Do you remember what you said
when you met me in your tent?

06:16.126 --> 06:20.171
That I should make love to you
like it was your last day on this earth.

06:32.976 --> 06:34.643
As you know, Your Grace,

06:34.728 --> 06:37.563
it is not only the sworn duty of a maester

06:37.647 --> 06:40.691
to carry out the wishes
of the house he serves,

06:40.776 --> 06:43.527
but also to offer guidance

06:43.612 --> 06:46.781
and counsel in times of war.

06:46.865 --> 06:49.408
Your words are always wise and measured.

06:49.493 --> 06:51.911
- If you could...
- if anything,

06:51.995 --> 06:55.915
a maester's duties become more urgent

06:55.999 --> 06:59.335
in times of war and turmoil.

07:00.712 --> 07:03.756
I remember back in the days of King...

07:03.840 --> 07:05.382
You brought me something?

07:06.426 --> 07:07.426
Yes.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.224
Essence of nightshade

07:13.892 --> 07:17.311
is as dangerous as it is efficacious.

07:18.563 --> 07:20.856
A single drop in a cup of wine

07:21.525 --> 07:24.693
suffices to soothe ragged nerves.

07:25.278 --> 07:29.490
Three drops will bring on
a deep and dreamless sleep.

07:31.243 --> 07:32.618
Ten drops, however...

07:32.702 --> 07:34.453
I know what ten drops will bring.

07:34.538 --> 07:36.914
Your Grace, if I may ask...

07:36.998 --> 07:38.374
You may not.

07:40.710 --> 07:42.920
You must have a lot of work to do.

07:43.004 --> 07:45.548
I'm sure many brave men
will need your wisdom soon.

07:47.342 --> 07:50.302
Yes. A siege is very...

07:50.387 --> 07:52.555
Be careful on the stairs, Grand Maester.
There are so many.

07:56.101 --> 07:57.518
Your Grace.

08:00.897 --> 08:02.982
And so he spoke

08:03.483 --> 08:08.070
That Lord of Castamere

08:08.155 --> 08:13.075
But now the rains weep o'er his halls

08:13.160 --> 08:17.496
With no one there to hear

08:17.622 --> 08:22.710
Yes, now the rains weep o'er his halls

08:22.794 --> 08:28.340
And not a soul to hear

08:28.425 --> 08:32.260
- Good boys!
- Lannisters!

08:32.345 --> 08:34.179
Where'd you learn the Lannister song?

08:34.264 --> 08:35.931
Drunk Lannisters.

08:38.268 --> 08:39.894
You've got a pretty voice.

08:39.977 --> 08:41.895
Thank you very much.

08:41.980 --> 08:43.230
And I like your nose.

08:44.357 --> 08:45.941
How many times you break it?

08:47.736 --> 08:49.570
Well, now let's see.

08:50.739 --> 08:52.990
First time, I was five.

08:53.783 --> 08:56.368
- My mam smacked me with an iron poker.
- Oh.

08:56.953 --> 08:59.371
It wasn't me she was aiming at.

08:59.456 --> 09:01.332
She was trying for my little brother.

09:01.416 --> 09:02.708
Now he was a real pest.

09:03.001 --> 09:05.961
Second time, I was nine.

09:07.172 --> 09:09.798
Got in a scrap with a few older boys.

09:10.217 --> 09:11.467
They won.

09:12.510 --> 09:13.510
Third time...

09:22.062 --> 09:25.022
Eh, you don't want to know
about the third time.

09:27.817 --> 09:29.151
Poor nose.

09:30.111 --> 09:31.779
Don't feel sorry for him.

09:31.863 --> 09:34.698
He'll be halfway up your arse
before the night's through.

09:46.044 --> 09:47.336
Welcome, friends.

09:51.716 --> 09:53.050
This round's on me.

10:03.019 --> 10:04.478
I don't think he likes me.

10:18.243 --> 10:19.576
You think you're a hard man?

10:21.830 --> 10:23.163
I know it.

10:28.586 --> 10:30.254
It's warm in here.

10:30.964 --> 10:32.798
We've got beautiful women

10:32.882 --> 10:34.216
and good brown ale.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.719
Plenty for everyone.

10:37.679 --> 10:38.929
And all you want

10:39.014 --> 10:41.640
is to put one of us in the cold ground

10:42.475 --> 10:44.518
with no women to keep us company.

10:44.602 --> 10:46.937
Oh, there's women in the ground.

10:47.022 --> 10:48.981
I put some there myself.

10:49.816 --> 10:51.233
So have you.

10:53.028 --> 10:55.195
You like fucking and drinking

10:55.572 --> 10:56.989
and singing.

10:59.284 --> 11:00.701
But killing,

11:01.911 --> 11:04.121
killing's the thing you love.

11:05.415 --> 11:07.207
You're just like me.

11:10.587 --> 11:12.087
Only smaller.

11:14.758 --> 11:16.175
And quicker.

11:16.593 --> 11:18.427
Eh?

11:20.722 --> 11:23.223
Your Lord lmp's going to miss you.

11:29.773 --> 11:31.190
Aye...

11:33.777 --> 11:35.819
I expect he will someday.

11:41.242 --> 11:42.659
Here we are.

11:54.923 --> 11:56.507
One more drink before the war?

11:57.175 --> 11:58.550
Shall we?

12:09.896 --> 12:12.231
I've always hated the bells.

12:12.315 --> 12:14.024
They ring for horror.

12:14.109 --> 12:16.735
A dead king, a city under siege.

12:16.820 --> 12:18.570
- A wedding.
- Exactly.

12:21.199 --> 12:22.950
Podrick, is that it?

12:23.034 --> 12:25.244
"Is that it?" Nice touch.

12:26.037 --> 12:28.705
As if you don't know the name
of every boy in town.

12:29.040 --> 12:31.583
I'm not entirely sure what you're suggesting.

12:31.668 --> 12:34.878
I'm entirely sure you're entirely sure
what I'm suggesting.

12:35.755 --> 12:37.297
Do you trust him?

12:41.052 --> 12:42.511
Oddly enough, I do.

12:44.264 --> 12:45.347
Good.

12:51.187 --> 12:52.896
The map you asked for.

12:57.569 --> 13:00.112
There must be 20 miles of tunnels
beneath the city.

13:00.196 --> 13:01.822
Closer to 50.

13:01.906 --> 13:05.451
The Targaryens built this city
to withstand a siege

13:05.535 --> 13:08.871
and to provide escape if necessary.

13:09.372 --> 13:10.998
I'm not escaping.

13:11.458 --> 13:13.250
Strange as it sounds,
I'm the captain of the ship,

13:13.334 --> 13:14.877
and if the ship goes down, I go with her.

13:15.253 --> 13:16.920
That is good to hear.

13:17.005 --> 13:21.341
Though I'm sure many captains say the same
while their ship is afloat.

13:22.635 --> 13:25.053
You look well suited for battle, my lord.

13:25.138 --> 13:26.597
Well, I'm not.

13:27.140 --> 13:29.516
For all our sakes, I hope you are wrong.

13:31.060 --> 13:32.519
My little birds tell me

13:32.604 --> 13:36.899
that Stannis Baratheon has taken up
with a red priestess from Asshai.

13:37.275 --> 13:38.817
What of it?

13:38.902 --> 13:42.196
You don't believe in the old powers, my lord?

13:42.280 --> 13:45.407
Blood spells, curses, shape-shifting.
What do you think?

13:46.409 --> 13:49.036
I think you believe in what you see

13:50.246 --> 13:52.581
and in what those you trust have seen.

13:54.292 --> 13:56.919
You probably don't entirely trust me.

13:57.545 --> 13:59.046
Mmm, don't take it personally.

13:59.130 --> 14:00.672
I don't entirely trust myself.

14:01.549 --> 14:03.550
And yet I have seen things

14:04.427 --> 14:06.053
and heard things,

14:06.429 --> 14:09.932
things you have not, things I wish I had not.

14:13.811 --> 14:16.480
I don't believe I've ever told you
how I was cut.

14:18.691 --> 14:20.108
No, I don't believe you have.

14:22.278 --> 14:23.946
One day, I will.

14:26.157 --> 14:29.910
The dark arts have
provided Lord Stannis with his armies

14:29.994 --> 14:32.371
and paved his path to our door.

14:33.456 --> 14:37.543
For a man in service to such powers
to sit on the Iron Throne,

14:37.627 --> 14:39.836
I can think of nothing worse.

14:40.922 --> 14:42.422
And tonight,

14:42.507 --> 14:46.260
I believe you are the only man
who can stop him.

15:13.246 --> 15:15.414
They're welcoming the new king.

15:15.498 --> 15:17.708
I've never known bells to mean surrender.

15:19.377 --> 15:21.253
They want to play music with us? Let's play.

15:21.337 --> 15:24.089
- Drums.
- Drums!

15:49.907 --> 15:51.283
Remember, wait till the ships...

15:51.367 --> 15:52.534
The ships are in the bay.

15:52.619 --> 15:55.787
- They must be far enough in...
- I know what "in" means.

15:55.872 --> 15:58.081
- Do you know how to use that?
- I chopped wood once.

15:58.666 --> 16:00.626
No, I watched my brother chopping wood.

16:00.710 --> 16:02.586
I saw you kill a man with a shield.

16:02.670 --> 16:04.212
You'll be unstoppable with an ax.

16:06.257 --> 16:08.342
- Don't get killed.
- Nor you, my friend.

16:08.426 --> 16:11.386
- Oh, are we friends now?
- Of course we are.

16:11.804 --> 16:15.098
Just because I pay you for your services
doesn't diminish our friendship.

16:15.183 --> 16:16.308
Enhances it, really.

16:16.726 --> 16:18.977
Oh! "Enhances." Fancy word for a sellsword.

16:19.312 --> 16:21.855
Been spending time with fancy folks.

16:32.909 --> 16:36.078
Lady Sansa and Sheila.

16:37.121 --> 16:39.247
- Shae.
- Shae, yes.

16:39.832 --> 16:43.460
Surely my sister has asked you to join the
other highborn ladies in Maegor's holdfast.

16:43.544 --> 16:46.922
She has, my lord,
but King Joffrey sent for me to see him off.

16:48.341 --> 16:49.383
Sansa.

16:49.467 --> 16:51.218
Always been a great romantic, my nephew.

16:51.552 --> 16:52.928
Sansa, come here.

16:55.723 --> 16:57.766
I will pray for your safe return, my lord.

16:58.893 --> 17:01.687
- Will you?
- Just as I pray for the king's.

17:06.733 --> 17:07.943
Stay safe, my lady.

17:08.027 --> 17:09.653
And you, my lion.

17:15.410 --> 17:17.743
Your king rides forth to battle.

17:18.496 --> 17:20.872
You should see him off with a kiss.

17:21.749 --> 17:23.040
My new blade.

17:23.291 --> 17:24.792
Hearteater, I've named it.

17:27.547 --> 17:28.839
Kiss it.

17:38.891 --> 17:40.600
You'll kiss it again when I return

17:40.685 --> 17:42.477
and taste my uncle's blood.

17:42.603 --> 17:44.187
Will you slay him yourself?

17:44.897 --> 17:47.816
If Stannis is fool enough to come near me.

17:48.151 --> 17:50.819
So you'll be outside the gates
fighting in the vanguard?

17:51.946 --> 17:55.866
A king doesn't discuss battle plans
with stupid girls.

17:56.367 --> 17:59.161
I'm sorry, Your Grace. You're right, I'm stupid.

17:59.245 --> 18:01.747
Of course you'll be in the vanguard.

18:01.831 --> 18:04.958
They say my brother Robb always goes
where the fighting is thickest.

18:05.209 --> 18:06.835
And he is only a pretender.

18:06.919 --> 18:08.503
Your brother's turn will come.

18:09.505 --> 18:12.591
Then you can lick his blood
off Hearteater, too.

18:24.812 --> 18:27.814
Some of those boys will never come back.

18:27.899 --> 18:29.357
Joffrey will.

18:29.859 --> 18:31.985
- The worst ones always live.
- Shh.

18:33.237 --> 18:34.738
Come, my lady.

19:21.702 --> 19:23.537
Where's our fleet?

19:23.621 --> 19:24.621
On the way.

19:25.748 --> 19:27.666
Why isn't it here now? They're coming.

19:29.752 --> 19:33.421
Hound, tell the Hand
that his king has asked him a question.

19:33.506 --> 19:35.257
The king has asked you a question.

19:35.800 --> 19:39.845
Ser Lancel, tell the Hound to tell the king
that the Hand is extremely busy.

19:39.929 --> 19:42.848
The Hand of the King would like me
to tell you to tell the king...

19:42.932 --> 19:46.017
if I tell the Hound to cut you in half,
he'll do it without a second thought.

19:46.102 --> 19:48.061
That would make me the quarterman.

19:48.145 --> 19:50.105
It just doesn't have the same ring to it.

19:51.274 --> 19:54.234
Cut me in half and I won't be
able to give the signal.

19:54.318 --> 19:55.569
No signal, no plan.

19:55.653 --> 19:59.155
No plan and Stannis Baratheon
sacks this city, takes the Iron Throne,

19:59.740 --> 20:02.158
puts your pinched little head
atop a gate somewhere.

20:02.952 --> 20:04.828
It might be quite amusing,

20:04.912 --> 20:06.496
except that my head would be up there, too.

20:06.914 --> 20:08.623
I've never much liked my head,

20:08.708 --> 20:11.626
but I don't want to see it removed just yet.

20:14.672 --> 20:16.214
Where are their ships?

20:16.299 --> 20:18.925
It was wise to attack at night.
We took them by surprise.

20:19.010 --> 20:22.053
Lord Varys knows what you had
for breakfast three days ago.

20:22.138 --> 20:23.680
There are no surprises here.

20:23.764 --> 20:25.891
If it's true there is dissension in their ranks,

20:25.975 --> 20:27.726
maybe their sailors have mutinied.

20:28.185 --> 20:29.352
Maybe.

20:45.912 --> 20:47.829
I don't know why she wants me here.

20:47.914 --> 20:50.790
She's always saying how stupid I am.
She hates me.

20:50.875 --> 20:54.294
Maybe she hates you less than
she hates everyone else.

20:55.254 --> 20:56.630
I doubt it.

20:57.173 --> 20:59.299
Maybe she's jealous of you.

21:00.051 --> 21:01.718
Why would she be jealous?

21:02.053 --> 21:03.345
Sansa.

21:07.350 --> 21:09.851
I was wondering where
our little dove had flown.

21:11.062 --> 21:12.854
You look pale, child.

21:13.731 --> 21:15.482
Is your red flower still blooming?

21:16.192 --> 21:17.275
Yes.

21:18.152 --> 21:19.361
Fitting, isn't it?

21:20.071 --> 21:23.281
The men will bleed out there
and you will bleed in here.

21:24.116 --> 21:25.909
Pour Lady Sansa some wine.

21:25.993 --> 21:27.452
I'm not thirsty, Your Grace.

21:27.536 --> 21:29.996
So? I didn't offer you water.

21:35.419 --> 21:36.711
What's he doing here?

21:37.338 --> 21:38.588
Ser llyn?

21:39.382 --> 21:41.299
He's here to defend us.

21:41.842 --> 21:44.970
When the axes smash down those doors,
you may be glad to have him.

21:45.388 --> 21:47.305
But we have guards to defend us.

21:47.390 --> 21:48.974
Guards we have paid.

21:49.058 --> 21:51.559
Should the city fall,
they'll be the first ones out of the doors.

21:56.691 --> 21:58.984
The lads caught a groom and two maids
trying to sneak away

21:59.068 --> 22:01.111
with a stolen horse and some gold cups.

22:01.737 --> 22:03.947
The battle's first traitors.

22:04.031 --> 22:05.573
Have Ser llyn see to them.

22:05.658 --> 22:09.369
Put their heads on spikes
outside the stables as a warning.

22:11.122 --> 22:13.289
The only way to keep the small folk loyal

22:13.374 --> 22:16.501
is to make certain they fear you
more than they do the enemy.

22:16.585 --> 22:20.588
Remember that if you ever
hope to become a queen.

22:22.633 --> 22:24.676
You said he was here to protect us.

22:27.263 --> 22:28.471
He is.

22:29.473 --> 22:31.599
Traitors are a danger to us all.

22:31.976 --> 22:33.309
More wine.

22:48.200 --> 22:49.743
There they are.

22:53.205 --> 22:56.958
- Archers to their marks.
- Archers, to your marks!

22:59.628 --> 23:00.795
Archers!

23:07.011 --> 23:08.094
Nock your arrows!

23:08.721 --> 23:10.305
Nock arrows!

23:11.807 --> 23:14.142
- Hold fast.
- Hold fast!

23:14.518 --> 23:16.895
What are you doing? We need to attack them.

23:16.979 --> 23:19.898
- Hold fast.
- Boulders ready!

23:21.400 --> 23:22.776
Hold fast!

23:25.488 --> 23:27.739
There's only one ship.
Where are the rest of them?

23:28.991 --> 23:30.784
Where are the rest of them?

23:35.414 --> 23:36.623
There's only one ship.

23:40.544 --> 23:42.545
Archers, stand to!

23:43.089 --> 23:44.130
Man the below!

23:44.632 --> 23:46.424
- Nock.
- Nock and set!

23:47.760 --> 23:49.135
Draw!

23:55.184 --> 23:56.267
Hold.

23:56.685 --> 23:58.019
Hold.

24:06.529 --> 24:08.530
There's no one on board.

24:14.662 --> 24:16.496
More rocks coming up!

24:32.930 --> 24:34.013
Hold.

24:41.313 --> 24:42.355
Wildfire.

24:42.731 --> 24:45.275
Steer clear! Steer clear!

25:10.426 --> 25:12.468
Matthos! Get down!

26:46.814 --> 26:48.940
- Prepare to land.
- Your Grace.

26:49.024 --> 26:51.067
The dwarf has played his little trick.

26:51.151 --> 26:53.861
- The wildfire.
- He can only play it once.

26:53.946 --> 26:56.114
We're too far from the gates.

26:56.198 --> 26:58.408
The fire, their archers...

26:58.826 --> 27:00.535
Hundreds will die.

27:01.870 --> 27:03.246
Thousands.

27:17.094 --> 27:19.429
Come with me and take this city!

27:37.865 --> 27:40.116
Sansa, come here, little dove.

27:46.248 --> 27:47.582
My queen.

27:48.417 --> 27:49.917
What are you doing?

27:50.294 --> 27:51.294
Praying.

27:51.962 --> 27:54.172
You're perfect, aren't you?

27:54.256 --> 27:55.506
Praying.

27:56.467 --> 27:58.176
What are you praying for?

27:58.260 --> 28:00.553
For the gods to have mercy on us all.

28:00.637 --> 28:02.597
Oh.

28:02.681 --> 28:03.973
On all of us?

28:04.058 --> 28:06.100
- Yes, Your Grace.
- Even me?

28:06.977 --> 28:08.269
Of course, Your Grace.

28:08.729 --> 28:09.854
Even Joffrey?

28:12.441 --> 28:15.526
- Joffrey is my...
- Oh, shut up, you little fool.

28:15.611 --> 28:18.696
Praying to the gods to have mercy on us all.

28:18.781 --> 28:20.865
The gods have no mercy.
That's why they're gods.

28:22.493 --> 28:25.119
My father told me that
when he caught me praying.

28:26.789 --> 28:29.040
My mother had just died, you see.

28:29.124 --> 28:33.294
I didn't really understand
the concept of death, the finality of it.

28:34.171 --> 28:36.547
I thought that if I prayed very, very hard,

28:36.632 --> 28:39.509
the gods would return my mother to me.
I was four.

28:40.302 --> 28:42.470
Your father doesn't believe in the gods?

28:42.554 --> 28:44.931
He believes in them,
he just doesn't like them very much.

28:48.352 --> 28:49.811
One for her.

28:53.816 --> 28:54.941
Here.

28:57.277 --> 28:58.319
Sit.

28:58.946 --> 29:00.113
Drink.

29:03.409 --> 29:05.493
Not like that. Drink, girl.

29:09.081 --> 29:11.082
I should have been born a man.

29:11.166 --> 29:13.126
I'd rather face a thousand swords

29:13.210 --> 29:16.671
than be shut up inside
with this flock of frightened hens.

29:17.214 --> 29:20.675
They are your guests under your protection.
You asked them here.

29:20.968 --> 29:22.927
It was expected of me,

29:23.011 --> 29:26.514
as it will be of you
if you ever become Joffrey's queen.

29:27.307 --> 29:30.768
If my wretched brother
should somehow prevail,

29:30.853 --> 29:33.855
these hens will return to their cocks

29:34.356 --> 29:37.900
and crow of how my courage inspired them,

29:37.985 --> 29:39.902
lifted their spirits.

29:39.987 --> 29:41.821
And if the city should fall?

29:44.366 --> 29:45.741
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

29:47.119 --> 29:48.953
The Red Keep should hold for a time,

29:49.037 --> 29:53.541
long enough for me to go to the walls
and yield to Lord Stannis in person.

29:54.168 --> 29:56.377
If it were anyone else outside those gates,

29:56.503 --> 29:58.379
I might have hoped for a private audience,

29:58.464 --> 30:00.715
but this is Stannis Baratheon.

30:01.425 --> 30:04.886
I'd have a better chance
of seducing his horse.

30:08.223 --> 30:10.475
Have I shocked you, little dove?

30:10.559 --> 30:13.227
Tears aren't a woman's only weapon.

30:15.564 --> 30:17.940
The best one's between your legs.

30:18.025 --> 30:20.735
Learn how to use it. Drink.

30:24.531 --> 30:28.242
Do you have any notion of what happens
when a city is sacked?

30:29.703 --> 30:31.746
No, you wouldn't, would you?

30:33.248 --> 30:35.750
If the city falls, these fine women

30:37.336 --> 30:39.086
should be in for a bit of a rape.

30:40.339 --> 30:43.841
Half of them will have bastards
in their bellies come the morning.

30:44.801 --> 30:47.261
You'll be glad of your red flower then.

30:48.764 --> 30:52.266
When a man's blood is up,
anything with tits looks good.

30:53.519 --> 30:57.605
A precious thing like you
will look very, very good.

30:58.857 --> 31:00.733
A slice of cake

31:00.817 --> 31:02.944
just waiting to be eaten.

31:05.531 --> 31:07.114
More pressure!

31:17.459 --> 31:20.419
- Pull! Pull!
- That's it, men!

31:21.880 --> 31:23.923
Pull! Pull!

31:28.512 --> 31:31.389
He's a serious man, Stannis Baratheon.

31:32.057 --> 31:33.724
They're coming. They're coming ashore.

31:35.310 --> 31:36.602
Rain fire on them.

31:37.479 --> 31:38.521
Archers!

31:38.605 --> 31:39.772
There are too many.

31:40.357 --> 31:42.775
Hound, form a welcome party
for any Baratheon troop

31:42.859 --> 31:44.694
that manages to touch solid ground.

31:46.947 --> 31:49.740
Pod, run to the King's Gate.

31:50.367 --> 31:52.368
Bring any men guarding it here, now.

31:52.452 --> 31:53.536
Yes, my lord.

31:54.663 --> 31:57.623
Let's go. Stannis is sending us fresh meat.

31:58.083 --> 31:59.375
You, too.

32:01.169 --> 32:03.713
Any of these flaming fucking arrows
come near me,

32:03.797 --> 32:06.382
I'll strangle you with your own guts.

32:09.678 --> 32:13.222
Pull, pull! Go!

32:13.307 --> 32:14.557
Nock!

32:18.520 --> 32:20.146
Draw!

32:20.230 --> 32:22.523
- Draw!
- Draw!

32:32.743 --> 32:34.410
Kill the Lannisters!

32:34.494 --> 32:37.204
- Loose!
- Loose!

32:46.757 --> 32:48.549
- Draw!
- Draw!

32:48.634 --> 32:50.843
- Loose!
- Loose!

33:35.722 --> 33:37.181
To the Mud Gate, go now!

33:37.265 --> 33:40.768
First and second squads, to the gate!
To the Mud Gate!

33:41.144 --> 33:43.062
Any man dies with a clean sword,

33:43.146 --> 33:45.439
I'll rape his fucking corpse.

34:20.809 --> 34:22.560
CERSEl: When we were young, Jaime and I,

34:22.643 --> 34:26.563
we looked so much alike
even our father couldn't tell us apart.

34:26.648 --> 34:30.234
I could never understand why
they treated us differently.

34:30.985 --> 34:34.780
Jaime was taught to fight
with sword and lance and mace,

34:35.239 --> 34:37.491
and I was taught to smile

34:37.868 --> 34:39.452
and sing and please.

34:39.995 --> 34:42.163
He was heir to Casterly Rock,

34:42.831 --> 34:45.373
and I was sold to some stranger like a horse

34:45.458 --> 34:47.376
to be ridden whenever he desired.

34:47.710 --> 34:49.795
You were Robert's queen.

34:49.880 --> 34:52.005
And you will be Joffrey's. Enjoy.

34:56.511 --> 34:58.179
I don't think I know this one.

35:04.102 --> 35:05.436
Pretty.

35:12.027 --> 35:13.861
That's the worst curtsy I've ever seen.

35:14.362 --> 35:16.697
Here, it's not difficult.
I mastered it when I was four.

35:17.407 --> 35:19.658
Straighten your back and bend.

35:22.829 --> 35:24.497
Better. You learn fast.

35:25.207 --> 35:28.334
How long have you been
in Lady Sansa's service?

35:29.211 --> 35:31.962
A few weeks, Your Grace.

35:34.633 --> 35:36.550
When did you leave Lorath?

35:38.553 --> 35:40.554
I had a Lorathi handmaiden once.

35:43.725 --> 35:46.352
But she was a nobleman's daughter.

35:46.436 --> 35:47.603
You're not.

35:51.817 --> 35:53.442
When did you come to Westeros?

35:54.903 --> 35:56.654
Ten years ago, Your Grace.

35:57.447 --> 36:01.408
From Lorathi commoner to the Red Keep
in 10 years,

36:01.868 --> 36:04.370
all without learning how to curtsy.

36:05.413 --> 36:07.456
I imagine that's a very interesting story.

36:08.959 --> 36:09.959
What's your name?

36:10.669 --> 36:12.419
Shae, Your Grace.

36:12.921 --> 36:14.505
Tell us a story, Shae.

36:20.762 --> 36:22.513
When I was 13, l...

36:24.891 --> 36:25.975
Your Grace!

36:26.852 --> 36:28.185
What news?

36:29.396 --> 36:31.397
The lmp has set the river afire.

36:31.481 --> 36:34.108
Hundreds of ships are burning, maybe more.

36:34.192 --> 36:36.610
Stannis' fleet destroyed, but...

36:37.654 --> 36:38.696
But...

36:38.780 --> 36:42.616
But his troops
have landed outside the city walls.

36:43.285 --> 36:44.952
Where is Joffrey?

36:45.620 --> 36:47.746
On the battlements with Lord Tyrion.

36:47.831 --> 36:50.082
Bring him back inside at once.

36:50.667 --> 36:52.459
- Your Grace...
- What?

36:52.961 --> 36:55.296
The king's presence is good for morale.

36:55.380 --> 36:58.090
Bring him back to his chambers now.

36:58.174 --> 36:59.925
- Not here?
- With the women and children?

37:00.010 --> 37:02.428
Do you want him to be mocked as a coward
for the rest of his life?

37:02.512 --> 37:04.346
- No, but l...
- Now!

37:10.103 --> 37:13.188
When I told you about Ser llyn earlier, I lied.

37:15.400 --> 37:16.817
Do you want to hear the truth?

37:17.110 --> 37:19.278
You want to know why he's really here?

37:21.156 --> 37:22.656
He's here for us.

37:23.325 --> 37:25.910
Stannis may take the city,
he may take the throne,

37:25.994 --> 37:27.912
but he will not take us alive.

38:02.197 --> 38:03.238
Help me!

38:24.094 --> 38:26.428
- Fall back!
- Fall back!

38:34.854 --> 38:35.980
Get the ladders up!

39:09.681 --> 39:12.099
Faster, you bastards! Faster!

39:12.684 --> 39:14.601
Come on, kill the scum!

39:16.604 --> 39:18.689
Someone bring me a drink.

39:24.946 --> 39:27.448
Fuck the water. Bring me wine.

39:38.418 --> 39:40.294
Can I get you some iced milk

39:40.378 --> 39:42.546
and a nice bowl of raspberries, too?

39:43.131 --> 39:44.298
Eat shit, dwarf.

39:45.091 --> 39:46.884
You're on the wrong side of the wall.

39:47.135 --> 39:48.886
I lost half my men.

39:50.430 --> 39:52.431
The Blackwater's on fire.

39:52.515 --> 39:55.726
Dog, I command you to
go back out there and fight.

39:59.773 --> 40:01.648
You're Kingsguard, Clegane.

40:01.983 --> 40:04.318
You must beat them back or
they're going to take this city.

40:04.944 --> 40:06.779
Your king's city.

40:08.490 --> 40:09.823
Fuck the Kingsguard.

40:11.493 --> 40:12.618
Fuck the city.

40:14.162 --> 40:15.204
Fuck the king.

40:33.556 --> 40:34.807
Loose!

40:34.891 --> 40:36.850
Put your backs into it!

40:37.352 --> 40:39.019
All right, get up!

40:42.524 --> 40:43.524
Loose!

40:43.608 --> 40:44.691
Clear!

40:44.776 --> 40:46.026
Forward!

40:47.570 --> 40:48.737
Loose!

41:01.376 --> 41:03.293
Forward ladders!

41:23.189 --> 41:24.439
Heave!

41:24.941 --> 41:26.108
Heave!

41:26.568 --> 41:27.901
Your Grace,

41:28.319 --> 41:30.988
the queen has sent me to
bring you back to the Red Keep.

41:33.741 --> 41:35.742
If you won't defend your own city,
why should they?

41:36.578 --> 41:37.870
What would you have me do?

41:37.954 --> 41:39.288
Lead.

41:39.372 --> 41:42.583
Get down there and lead your people
against the invaders who want to kill them.

41:43.418 --> 41:46.503
What did my mother say exactly?
Did she have urgent business with me?

41:46.588 --> 41:47.921
She did not say, Your Grace.

41:49.757 --> 41:51.884
All men to the battlements!

41:53.803 --> 41:55.637
Ser Boros, Ser Mandon,

41:55.722 --> 41:59.349
stay with my uncle and represent the king
on the field of battle.

42:00.810 --> 42:03.103
Archers, hold your line

42:03.188 --> 42:04.771
or I'll kill you myself.

42:08.651 --> 42:10.110
Stand fast!

42:19.454 --> 42:20.746
No!

42:22.290 --> 42:23.790
Get up, you fool.

42:23.875 --> 42:25.667
We need more arrows!

42:29.172 --> 42:30.839
Where is the king?

42:30.924 --> 42:34.009
- Why isn't he with us?
- Who are we fighting for?

42:35.803 --> 42:37.054
Who leads us?

42:37.138 --> 42:38.931
I'll lead the attack.

42:39.515 --> 42:41.308
I'll lead the attack!

42:42.393 --> 42:44.519
- Yes.
- What are you talking about?

42:45.021 --> 42:46.146
Pod, my helmet.

42:48.816 --> 42:50.817
Ser Mandon, you will bear the king's banner.

42:50.902 --> 42:52.361
Men, form up.

42:54.948 --> 42:56.031
Men...

42:57.659 --> 42:58.825
Men!

42:59.452 --> 43:02.079
They say I'm half a man.

43:02.163 --> 43:04.831
But what does that make the lot of you?

43:04.916 --> 43:07.459
The only way out is through the gates.

43:07.543 --> 43:08.919
And they're at the gates.

43:09.003 --> 43:11.421
There's another way out.
I'm going to show you.

43:12.257 --> 43:15.092
We'll come out behind them
and fuck them in their arses.

43:17.929 --> 43:19.137
Heave!

43:19.764 --> 43:20.973
Heave!

43:21.599 --> 43:23.558
Don't fight for your king

43:23.643 --> 43:25.936
and don't fight for his kingdoms.

43:27.272 --> 43:29.606
Don't fight for honor. Don't fight for glory.

43:29.691 --> 43:32.067
Don't fight for riches,
because you won't get any.

43:32.568 --> 43:35.028
This is your city Stannis means to sack.

43:35.113 --> 43:36.863
That's your gate he's ramming.

43:37.282 --> 43:40.200
If he gets in, it will be your houses he burns,

43:41.411 --> 43:43.203
your gold he steals,

43:43.746 --> 43:45.706
your women he will rape.

43:47.959 --> 43:50.210
Heave! Heave!

43:51.212 --> 43:52.379
Heave!

43:54.590 --> 43:57.050
Those are brave men knocking at our door.

43:58.553 --> 43:59.720
Let's go kill them.

44:22.577 --> 44:24.870
The battle is lost, Your Grace.

44:25.413 --> 44:28.165
Stannis' troops are at the gates.

44:28.249 --> 44:30.959
When the gold cloaks saw the king leaving,

44:31.044 --> 44:33.086
they lost all heart.

44:33.171 --> 44:34.588
Where is my son?

44:34.672 --> 44:36.590
I want to escort him back to the battle.

44:37.008 --> 44:38.425
Why do I care what you want?

44:39.635 --> 44:40.927
- Bring me...
- Now listen to me...

44:48.770 --> 44:51.521
Don't be afraid.
The queen has raised the drawbridge.

44:51.606 --> 44:53.899
This is the safest place we can be.

44:53.983 --> 44:56.860
Joffrey's not hurt. He's fighting bravely.

44:56.944 --> 44:58.904
His knights have rallied behind him.

44:58.988 --> 45:00.197
They will save the city.

45:01.366 --> 45:02.866
Shall we sing a hymn?

45:04.077 --> 45:08.288
Gentle mother, font of mercy

45:08.790 --> 45:12.667
Save our sons from war, we pray

45:14.545 --> 45:15.879
You must go.

45:15.963 --> 45:18.465
Run to your chamber and bar your door.

45:18.549 --> 45:21.593
Stannis won't hurt you. This one will.

45:24.472 --> 45:27.391
- Come with me.
- I need to say goodbye to someone.

45:27.475 --> 45:29.559
The queen said they'd rape everyone.

45:29.811 --> 45:31.311
No one is raping me.

45:34.148 --> 45:35.565
Go. Run.

46:14.689 --> 46:16.898
The lady is starting to panic.

46:18.151 --> 46:19.609
What are you doing here?

46:19.694 --> 46:21.528
Not here for long.

46:22.155 --> 46:23.905
- I'm going.
- Where?

46:25.032 --> 46:27.242
Someplace that isn't burning.

46:29.579 --> 46:30.996
North, might be.

46:31.664 --> 46:32.914
Could be.

46:34.000 --> 46:35.750
What about the king?

46:36.919 --> 46:39.546
He can die just fine on his own.

46:45.386 --> 46:47.304
I can take you with me.

46:48.389 --> 46:50.307
Take you to Winterfell.

46:55.396 --> 46:57.189
I'll keep you safe.

46:59.775 --> 47:01.693
Do you want to go home?

47:05.239 --> 47:06.948
I'll be safe here.

47:07.033 --> 47:08.200
Stannis won't hurt me.

47:10.411 --> 47:11.828
Look at me.

47:13.539 --> 47:15.290
Stannis is a killer.

47:16.375 --> 47:17.626
The Lannisters are killers.

47:18.836 --> 47:20.337
Your father was a killer.

47:21.214 --> 47:23.215
Your brother is a killer.

47:24.926 --> 47:26.760
Your sons will be killers someday.

47:29.222 --> 47:31.556
The world is built by killers.

47:35.436 --> 47:38.355
So you'd better get used to looking at them.

47:41.692 --> 47:43.401
You won't hurt me.

47:50.368 --> 47:52.744
No, little bird, I won't hurt you.

48:17.019 --> 48:18.186
Heave!

48:24.193 --> 48:26.736
Come on, you bastards! Get up those ladders!

48:30.950 --> 48:32.325
Attack!

48:46.507 --> 48:47.716
Roll it over!

48:54.932 --> 48:59.019
Halfman! Halfman! Halfman!

49:10.364 --> 49:12.032
Oh, fuck me.

50:03.668 --> 50:05.085
Shh!

50:06.295 --> 50:08.004
Be calm, my sweet.

50:08.089 --> 50:09.964
They're still fighting.

50:11.884 --> 50:13.968
No one's going to hurt you.

50:17.848 --> 50:19.724
I'll tell you a story.

50:20.768 --> 50:23.311
You know the one about
the mother lion and her little cub?

50:24.021 --> 50:26.606
- They lived in the woods.
- The Kingswood?

50:26.691 --> 50:28.191
Yes, my love.

50:28.901 --> 50:32.362
In the Kingswood,
there lived a mother and her cub.

50:32.446 --> 50:34.322
She loved him very much.

50:36.325 --> 50:39.369
But there were other things
that lived in the woods. Evil things.

50:39.453 --> 50:40.787
Like what?

50:43.290 --> 50:44.666
Like stags.

50:45.751 --> 50:47.252
Stags aren't evil.

50:47.336 --> 50:49.129
They only eat grass.

50:49.588 --> 50:50.630
And wolves.

50:51.132 --> 50:52.590
My lord.

50:52.675 --> 50:54.676
CERSEl: He could hear them
howling in the night.

50:55.010 --> 50:57.053
The little cub was frightened.

50:57.138 --> 51:01.433
His mother said, "You are a lion, my son.
You mustn't be afraid.

51:15.239 --> 51:17.824
"For one day, all the beasts will bow to you.

51:17.908 --> 51:19.576
"You will be king.

51:21.704 --> 51:24.873
"All the stags will bow.
All the wolves will bow.

51:25.791 --> 51:29.043
"The bears in the north
and the foxes of the south,

51:30.671 --> 51:34.090
"all the birds in the sky
and the beasts in the sea,

51:36.177 --> 51:38.887
"they will all come to you, little lion,

51:39.930 --> 51:41.264
"to rest a crown upon your head."

51:47.646 --> 51:49.147
And the cub said,

51:49.231 --> 51:52.192
"Will I be strong and fierce like my father?"

51:53.652 --> 51:55.528
"Yes," said his mother.

51:56.238 --> 51:59.199
"You will be strong and fierce
just like your father."

52:17.760 --> 52:21.554
I will keep you safe, my love.

52:22.389 --> 52:23.556
I promise you.

52:32.817 --> 52:34.526
Back to the boats!

52:36.737 --> 52:38.404
Stand and fight!

52:39.907 --> 52:42.492
Stand and fight, damn you!

52:43.327 --> 52:44.786
No!

52:47.832 --> 52:49.249
Father.

52:54.547 --> 52:57.549
The battle is over. We have won.

53:06.934 --> 53:11.938
"And who are you,"
the proud lord said

53:12.022 --> 53:16.359
"That I must bow so low?"

53:17.278 --> 53:21.948
"Only a cat of a different coat

53:22.032 --> 53:26.452
"That's all the truth I know

53:27.121 --> 53:32.125
"In a coat of gold or a coat of red

53:32.209 --> 53:37.130
"A lion still has claws

53:37.214 --> 53:42.218
"And mine are long and sharp, my lord

53:42.303 --> 53:46.556
"As long and sharp as yours"

53:49.393 --> 53:54.689
And so he spoke, and so he spoke

53:54.773 --> 53:59.694
That Lord of Castamere

53:59.778 --> 54:04.824
But now the rains weep o'er his hall

54:04.909 --> 54:09.621
With no one there to hear

54:09.705 --> 54:15.084
Yes, now the rains weep o'er his hall

54:15.169 --> 54:19.797
And not a soul to hear
