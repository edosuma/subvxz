WEBVTT

00:12.762 --> 00:14.889
-<i>Allez!</i>

00:19.019 --> 00:20.395
<i>-Allez,</i> Gabriel!
-Whoo!

00:27.652 --> 00:30.238
-Whoo!
-Bravo!

00:31.031 --> 00:32.949
They're so cute.

00:33.033 --> 00:36.411
You know, Gabriel doesn't invite
just anyone to play with the guys.

00:36.494 --> 00:38.621
They seem to be getting along.

00:38.705 --> 00:41.166
Yeah, I know, it's like
we're one big, happy family.

00:42.292 --> 00:44.461
I'm… I'm really happy for you, Emily.

00:44.544 --> 00:48.048
From what you've told me,
Alfie seems perfect for you.

00:48.423 --> 00:50.925
He's pretty great,
but, you know, we're just having fun.

00:51.009 --> 00:52.844
-It's nothing serious.
-Yet.

00:54.554 --> 00:57.891
-Why not go for it?
-We're both just passing through.

00:59.100 --> 01:01.269
-Hey.
-Hey.

01:01.352 --> 01:02.979
I didn't know you were coming.

01:03.063 --> 01:06.191
Well, I was in the neighborhood
and I love watching you play.

01:07.734 --> 01:09.235
You're all sweaty.

01:10.779 --> 01:12.530
You're like a pack of WAGs.

01:14.783 --> 01:16.701
Wives and girlfriends
of professional athletes.

01:18.119 --> 01:19.871
Like Victoria Beckham. Hmm?

01:21.456 --> 01:22.999
Come on, Cooper, I'm just kidding.

01:23.083 --> 01:25.585
Um, I'm not Gabriel's girlfriend.

01:26.628 --> 01:29.130
-We used to date but--
-We're all just friends now.

01:29.214 --> 01:31.007
-Mmm.
-Cool.

01:31.758 --> 01:33.718
That's the earliest
I've put my foot in my mouth

01:33.802 --> 01:34.761
upon meeting someone.

01:34.844 --> 01:36.596
I'm Alfie. I'm sorry.

01:36.679 --> 01:39.891
Don't worry about it. Camille.
You were quite good out there.

01:39.974 --> 01:42.602
Yeah, well, just trying
to keep up with this guy here.

01:47.357 --> 01:48.191
Hmm.

01:51.528 --> 01:54.197
Suddenly, I understand
why you love Paris so much.

01:55.240 --> 01:57.617
-Your friends are good people.
-They are.

01:57.700 --> 02:01.079
They were really welcoming
when I first got to Paris.

02:01.162 --> 02:03.289
Is there still something
going on between them?

02:03.832 --> 02:05.375
I thought I sensed it.

02:05.458 --> 02:08.837
Yeah, maybe. I… I don't know.

02:09.838 --> 02:11.047
Nah. Never mind.

02:11.673 --> 02:13.967
More likely they're just French, you know?

02:14.050 --> 02:15.718
Right.

02:17.095 --> 02:20.014
Hey, um,
what are you up to tomorrow night?

02:20.098 --> 02:21.683
Um, do you want to get dinner?

02:21.766 --> 02:24.936
Somewhere other than
Gabriel's restaurant or a dirty pub.

02:25.019 --> 02:27.939
-Are you asking me out, Cooper?
-Maybe.

02:37.448 --> 02:38.658
-Oh!
-Oh, shit!

02:38.741 --> 02:41.369
Em? Hi, hey, hi, what's up?

02:42.412 --> 02:44.998
Um… I forgot my phone charger.

02:46.207 --> 02:47.208
Yeah.

02:47.917 --> 02:50.003
Here. Sorry.
I thought you were rehearsing.

02:50.086 --> 02:52.213
-We're just about to start.
-Promise.

02:52.297 --> 02:54.132
Okay. Yeah, no, whatever.

02:55.049 --> 02:55.884
<i>Au revoir.</i>

02:55.967 --> 02:57.135
Bye, Emily.

02:57.218 --> 02:59.220
Bye.

03:04.434 --> 03:07.020
-What if we switch those chords?
-Like this?

03:09.939 --> 03:10.857
Yeah.

03:23.953 --> 03:25.288
Sexy. I love that.

03:25.914 --> 03:27.081
Yeah, it's cool.

03:41.679 --> 03:43.848
<i>We're about to take off.</i>
<i>You caught me just in time.</i>

03:43.932 --> 03:46.517
-Are you coming to Paris?
-Yes, my friend.

03:47.101 --> 03:48.186
Oh, my God!

03:48.269 --> 03:50.396
-Why didn't you tell me?
<i>-I just did, honey.</i>

03:50.480 --> 03:53.608
<i>God knows when I'll leave the house again</i>
<i>once this little monster pops out.</i>

03:54.984 --> 03:57.862
And it's time for an executive check-in
from the Gilbert Group.

03:57.946 --> 04:00.615
<i>Great. Um, does Sylvie know?</i>

04:00.698 --> 04:03.785
Oh, we're taking off now. Got to go.
I'll see you on the other side.

04:03.868 --> 04:05.370
<i>Bon voyage.</i>

04:19.092 --> 04:20.718
Emily! Emily!

04:21.219 --> 04:22.762
<i>-Bonjour,</i> Sylvie.
<i>-Bonjour.</i>

04:22.845 --> 04:25.932
I received a very sudden travel memo
from one of your people.

04:26.015 --> 04:28.268
-Did you know about this?
-Right. Madeline.

04:28.351 --> 04:30.103
Yeah, I just found out myself last night.

04:30.186 --> 04:31.396
Last night?

04:31.479 --> 04:34.524
Many hours have passed since last night
without a word from you.

04:37.360 --> 04:39.779
You told me
to stop texting you on weekends!

04:41.781 --> 04:42.782
Ugh!

04:43.992 --> 04:47.287
Everyone works here
in an open space?

04:47.370 --> 04:49.539
Yes, except for Sylvie,
who has her own office.

04:49.622 --> 04:52.500
Mmm. Mmm. Mmm!

04:53.084 --> 04:55.336
<i>-Bonjour,</i> Emily!

04:55.420 --> 04:57.880
-Get in here, girl.

04:58.923 --> 05:01.467
Look at you.

05:01.551 --> 05:03.928
Look at you. You're so chic now.

05:04.012 --> 05:06.514
Your purse is so small.
What do you keep in there?

05:08.474 --> 05:10.727
-And you must be Sylvie.
<i>-Oui.</i>

05:10.810 --> 05:14.022
Finally, we meet in person.

05:14.814 --> 05:16.065
Yeah.

05:16.149 --> 05:19.986
So to what do we owe the pleasure
of your very sudden arrival in Paris?

05:20.069 --> 05:22.405
Well, the Gilbert Group
likes a senior executive

05:22.488 --> 05:25.408
to come visit its subsidiaries
every once in a while.

05:25.491 --> 05:26.701
Just process.

05:26.784 --> 05:30.496
And thanks to what's cooking in here,
it was now or never.

05:30.580 --> 05:32.540
Well, it's a shame
you didn't let us know sooner.

05:32.623 --> 05:33.750
We could have prepared.

05:33.833 --> 05:36.961
Oh, no, I prefer to see you all,
you know, business as usual.

05:37.045 --> 05:38.296
Madeline, this is Luc.

05:38.379 --> 05:40.298
Luc, this is Madeline
from the Gilbert Group.

05:40.381 --> 05:42.008
Ah! Delighted.

05:42.091 --> 05:44.218
-Oh, congratulations!
-Oh, <i>merci.</i>

05:44.302 --> 05:46.012
-May I?
-Uh… Oh!

05:47.096 --> 05:49.182
I think it's a boy.

05:50.641 --> 05:52.143
I like this one.

05:52.727 --> 05:55.938
Oh, Mads, we have an important meeting
this morning with Maison Lavaux.

05:56.022 --> 05:59.025
Oh! I'd love to sit in on that.
Just to observe.

05:59.108 --> 06:00.902
I won't say a word. Fly on a wall.

06:00.985 --> 06:02.195
Sure.

06:02.278 --> 06:04.906
-Go get my fly swatter.
-I'm on it, right away.

06:08.910 --> 06:10.787
Our main objective is
to make sure

06:10.870 --> 06:13.206
the consumer understands
that Laboratoire Lavaux,

06:13.289 --> 06:15.583
while a hands-on interactive experience,

06:15.666 --> 06:18.711
still retains the classic nature
of the flagship brand.

06:18.795 --> 06:21.214
Yes, classic but custom and creative.

06:21.297 --> 06:22.882
Yes, but all the while emphasizing

06:22.965 --> 06:25.843
how scent reveals each person's
personal nature, right?

06:25.927 --> 06:29.180
Exactly. Do you consider yourself
a sunny, cheerful person?

06:29.722 --> 06:32.141
Citrus makes the perfect top note.

06:32.225 --> 06:36.312
Looking for something more flirtatious?
Look for rose, jasmine, vanilla.

06:36.396 --> 06:40.817
Or perhaps you transcend
the limits of masculine and feminine.

06:40.900 --> 06:44.487
Then a sandalwood base note is your match.

06:45.196 --> 06:47.907
Our tagline would be: <i>Lavaux c'est vous.</i>

06:53.454 --> 06:55.415
-I love it!

06:56.374 --> 06:58.501
Laboratoire Lavaux
is the culmination

06:58.584 --> 07:01.379
of something that started when
Maison Lavaux was a family business.

07:01.462 --> 07:03.339
Well, you've come a long way since then.

07:03.423 --> 07:05.883
A perfumery, candle distributor,

07:05.967 --> 07:09.053
relationships with global brands
like the Zimmer Group

07:09.137 --> 07:12.265
and the Laboratoire.
And even a restaurant in Paris.

07:12.348 --> 07:13.182
Is that right?

07:13.266 --> 07:15.226
<i>Oui.</i> Chez Lavaux.

07:15.852 --> 07:19.981
Yes, the chef of Chez Lavaux will be
designing the menu for the launch event.

07:20.064 --> 07:22.692
Yeah. It's quite a business
you've built, Antoine.

07:22.775 --> 07:25.111
And Savoir has been with you
every step of the way.

07:25.194 --> 07:26.863
Oh, I couldn't have done it without them.

07:27.780 --> 07:30.950
That's beautiful. Just beautiful. I…

07:31.033 --> 07:33.911
There's nothing I love more than growth.

07:33.995 --> 07:36.497
Well, then, it's a good thing.
You're pregnant.

07:46.132 --> 07:47.633
-Shit.

07:49.469 --> 07:50.303
Shit.

07:52.180 --> 07:53.014
Shit.

07:53.764 --> 07:55.975
Shit. Shit, shit, shit.

07:56.476 --> 07:58.519
-Étienne, what the hell did you do?
-Me?

07:58.603 --> 07:59.812
Yes, you. Look at this.

08:00.396 --> 08:02.356
"We met in a drag club here in Paris."

08:02.440 --> 08:04.525
"I couldn't believe
a socialite wanted to join,

08:04.609 --> 08:06.486
but it's a step up
from a bathroom attendant."

08:06.569 --> 08:07.737
What the fuck, Étienne?

08:08.696 --> 08:09.614
I trusted you.

08:10.198 --> 08:13.075
This is humiliating.
Everyone at home has probably seen this.

08:13.159 --> 08:14.285
My friends, my family…

08:15.161 --> 08:16.412
God, my family.

08:16.496 --> 08:17.788
Mindy, are you okay?

08:18.372 --> 08:21.083
I didn't know
our band was supposed to be a secret.

08:21.167 --> 08:23.169
All I did was talk to
my friend in China about you.

08:23.252 --> 08:25.671
-She was a fan, okay?
-Your friend?

08:25.755 --> 08:27.340
She's a journalist, but I didn't--

08:27.423 --> 08:28.716
Are you kidding me?

08:28.799 --> 08:32.094
-Someone tell me what the hell's going on!
-Your friend is a snake, that's what.

08:32.178 --> 08:34.555
And your girlfriend is a billionaire.

08:34.639 --> 08:36.557
What are you talking about?

08:36.641 --> 08:38.434
Go on. Tell him.

08:40.770 --> 08:42.480
Fine, then I will.

08:43.814 --> 08:47.151
Mindy's not some average <i>dame pipi</i>
we saved from obscurity, Benoît.

08:47.652 --> 08:50.780
She comes from
one of the richest families in China.

08:51.906 --> 08:54.784
-You're rich?
-No, I'm not. My father is.

08:54.867 --> 08:57.203
-Why didn't you tell me?
-How could I?

08:57.870 --> 09:00.373
I mean, you built up this story of us.

09:00.456 --> 09:04.835
That we are on some kind of star-crossed,
starving artist journey together, so I--

09:04.919 --> 09:07.547
All the stuff
we were writing about then is bullshit?

09:07.922 --> 09:08.756
No.

09:08.839 --> 09:11.092
Two penniless street musicians?
Poor in Paris?

09:11.634 --> 09:14.262
Finding each other.
Telling our shared story.

09:15.137 --> 09:16.889
Wow. You're slumming it with us.

09:16.973 --> 09:18.641
How do you think this feels for me?

09:18.724 --> 09:21.852
I'm trying to escape my past
and now it's all over the Internet.

09:21.936 --> 09:23.813
Oh, poor little rich girl!

09:26.065 --> 09:26.941
Fuck this.

09:27.775 --> 09:29.694
-Where are you going?
-Disappearing.

09:29.777 --> 09:32.863
-You're not even going to talk to me?
-You wouldn't understand.

09:32.947 --> 09:34.115
Is this the real you?

09:34.198 --> 09:37.159
Huh? Some princess playing a game
because you're what? Bored?

09:37.243 --> 09:39.120
Benoît, leave me alone.

09:41.289 --> 09:42.623
I knew she'd break up the band.

09:42.707 --> 09:44.542
No, no, no, man, you broke up the band.

09:49.755 --> 09:52.508
Well, I think Sylvie smoked
an entire pack before lunch.

09:53.050 --> 09:54.885
She is a piece of work, isn't she?

09:55.595 --> 09:57.513
There's a learning curve with Sylvie.

09:57.597 --> 09:59.890
She's definitely different
from other bosses I've had.

09:59.974 --> 10:00.975
Boss?

10:01.058 --> 10:03.894
Um, excuse me, I may be barefoot,
pregnant and across the pond,

10:03.978 --> 10:07.106
but rest assured, sweetie,
she is not your boss.

10:07.773 --> 10:09.775
I am. And thank God for that.

10:10.651 --> 10:13.696
Well, you have to admit
she's really good at her job though.

10:13.779 --> 10:17.533
All that growth with Maison Lavaux.
She's been head of that account for years.

10:17.617 --> 10:20.161
-She's kind of brilliant.
-I don't know about that, Em.

10:20.244 --> 10:22.455
I've been looking at the books
and they don't add up.

10:22.538 --> 10:26.334
Maison Lavaux, for example,
massively increased their business,

10:26.417 --> 10:28.502
but they're still charging Savoir
the same rate.

10:28.586 --> 10:30.838
They should have
at least doubled them by now.

10:30.921 --> 10:32.465
-Really?
-Mmm.

10:35.593 --> 10:38.137
Oh, well,
this is the place I was telling you about

10:38.220 --> 10:39.764
where my roommate plays with her band.

10:39.847 --> 10:41.223
Oh! Which one's your roommate?

10:42.558 --> 10:44.060
Uh…

10:44.143 --> 10:45.561
She's not there.

10:45.645 --> 10:47.396
-Um, I'll be right back.
-Okay.

10:55.780 --> 10:57.907
Hi, guys. Where is Mindy?

10:58.449 --> 10:59.617
She zipped off.

11:00.826 --> 11:03.245
She went home.
You should talk to her yourself.

11:04.121 --> 11:06.165
Tell me, Emily,
do you know who she really is?

11:06.248 --> 11:07.249
What?

11:07.333 --> 11:10.461
The secret's out.
We know who the real Mindy is.

11:10.961 --> 11:14.090
I guess she's too good
to be seen with us anymore.

11:14.173 --> 11:16.258
Look, I don't know what happened,

11:16.342 --> 11:19.011
but I do know
that Mindy really cares about you.

11:20.137 --> 11:21.931
And if she didn't tell you her story,

11:22.014 --> 11:24.892
maybe it's because
she didn't want to be judged by you.

11:24.975 --> 11:26.394
But it seems like you did anyway.

11:26.477 --> 11:27.561
It's not that simple.

11:28.270 --> 11:30.064
Excuse us. We have another song to play.

11:35.903 --> 11:37.071
Everything okay?

11:37.154 --> 11:39.532
Sorry, Mads, um, I've got to run.

11:39.615 --> 11:42.743
Of course. <i>Pas de problème.</i>
My hotel's near here, anyway.

11:42.827 --> 11:44.245
Okay. Bye.

11:44.328 --> 11:45.287
<i>Bonne nuit.</i>

11:53.838 --> 11:54.839
Okay, stop now.

11:57.550 --> 11:58.926
Okay, <i>arrêtez!</i>

12:02.263 --> 12:04.724
All right, go away now. Okay, bye.

12:09.270 --> 12:11.313
Seriously, I will cut you.

12:19.697 --> 12:20.698
Mindy!

12:21.991 --> 12:22.992
Min.

12:26.704 --> 12:29.749
Ugh. Min. What's the matter?

12:33.502 --> 12:35.379
Okay, well, this is all in Chinese.

12:36.922 --> 12:39.383
Oh, okay, this one's in English. Uh…

12:39.967 --> 12:42.720
"The former aspiring pop star
is now experiencing homelessness

12:42.803 --> 12:44.513
and busking on the mean streets of Paris."

12:44.597 --> 12:46.182
Don't read it out loud.

12:46.265 --> 12:48.100
Come on, get out of there. Come on.

12:49.977 --> 12:51.270
Are you okay?

12:51.353 --> 12:55.983
No, I'm not okay.
I'm actually pretty far from okay.

12:57.485 --> 13:00.196
I've gone viral
and not even for anything cool.

13:01.071 --> 13:04.241
I'm a disgrace. A disappointment.

13:05.284 --> 13:06.577
This is so embarrassing.

13:06.660 --> 13:08.245
You're not a disappointment.

13:08.329 --> 13:10.498
These headlines are just hyperbolic lies.

13:10.581 --> 13:14.418
-You are killing it out there busking.
-It doesn't matter.

13:15.419 --> 13:17.505
I'm a national embarrassment. Again.

13:18.130 --> 13:21.091
God, if my father didn't hate me before,
this'll do it.

13:21.175 --> 13:23.385
-Mindy.

13:26.847 --> 13:30.267
Why did this have to come back
and bite me in the ass now?

13:31.310 --> 13:33.854
Like, I've been really happy.

13:34.647 --> 13:37.733
And now Benoît just thinks
I was playing him.

13:38.192 --> 13:39.527
He'll get over it.

13:40.277 --> 13:41.529
How can you know that?

13:42.029 --> 13:43.572
Because you're the best.

13:46.200 --> 13:47.326
Am I wrong?

13:47.827 --> 13:51.413
No. It's true. I really am.

14:08.055 --> 14:10.724
<i>-Bonjour,</i> Madeline.
<i>-Bonjour,</i> Sylvie.

14:10.808 --> 14:14.687
Uh, I think you haven't
been told, but this is my office.

14:14.770 --> 14:15.980
What was that?

14:16.063 --> 14:18.524
Oh, pardon me, I thought
you wanted to practice your French.

14:18.607 --> 14:20.860
No, I do. I do, just not so fast.

14:20.943 --> 14:23.654
I'm glad that you're finally here though.
I've been here a while.

14:23.737 --> 14:24.989
Why?

14:25.072 --> 14:27.658
The early bird catches the worm,
of course.

14:27.741 --> 14:30.578
Oh. And who's the worm today?

14:31.120 --> 14:32.580
Please, have a seat.

14:32.663 --> 14:33.956
Excuse me?

14:34.540 --> 14:37.042
There's some business
I'd like to discuss with you.

14:37.126 --> 14:39.128
-Okay.
-Concerning Maison Lavaux.

14:39.712 --> 14:41.672
I'm so impressed
with how much they've grown

14:41.755 --> 14:44.258
since they signed with Savoir,
but I've got to tell you,

14:44.341 --> 14:47.261
the numbers on our end
simply don't add up.

14:47.970 --> 14:53.183
Sylvie, Antoine Lambert has been
paying Savoir the same meagre fee

14:53.267 --> 14:55.686
since the day he signed with us.
I… I'm just…

14:56.353 --> 14:57.730
I'm afraid he's taking advantage.

14:57.813 --> 15:01.775
Well, we've had that deal
with him for years.

15:01.859 --> 15:03.068
So you're aware?

15:03.152 --> 15:06.572
Yes. He had an arrangement
with the previous owner, you know…

15:06.655 --> 15:07.656
Okay.

15:08.782 --> 15:10.784
The key word
I'm hearing there is "previous."

15:10.868 --> 15:13.203
He no longer owns Savoir,
but we're still being underpaid.

15:14.788 --> 15:17.166
I don't know,
what do you suggest we do?

15:18.000 --> 15:21.754
I mean, Maison Lavaux
is among our most prestigious clientele

15:21.837 --> 15:23.923
and our longest partnerships.

15:24.006 --> 15:27.301
That kind of history matters to us.
It's not only about the money.

15:28.093 --> 15:33.307
Okay, I'm sensing that you're not
exactly willing to find a solution here?

15:33.390 --> 15:37.937
A solution? Well, frankly,
I don't know, I don't see the problem.

15:38.020 --> 15:39.563
Well, it's just that

15:39.647 --> 15:43.192
Emily attributes the success
of Maison Lavaux largely to you

15:43.275 --> 15:44.985
and I want to make sure that you,

15:45.069 --> 15:47.988
and therefore us,
are taking your winnings.

15:48.656 --> 15:50.574
I'm happy to look into this further.

15:50.658 --> 15:52.326
Well, if you insist.

15:53.827 --> 15:57.373
Oh, but I have to warn you
that Antoine can be quite prickly.

15:57.915 --> 16:00.209
One wrong move and he's out the door.

16:00.292 --> 16:03.671
I am not afraid of Antoine Lambert
and you shouldn't be either.

16:03.754 --> 16:05.714
He negotiated his deal with a man

16:05.798 --> 16:10.260
and this place is now run
by two strong women.

16:11.095 --> 16:12.888
We shouldn't sell ourselves short, Sylvie.

16:12.972 --> 16:15.265
Oh, yeah, trust me, I never do.

16:15.349 --> 16:17.726
Good. Good, because I do.

16:19.061 --> 16:20.980
-Trust you.
-Good.

16:24.525 --> 16:26.902
Sorry. Am I interrupting?

16:26.986 --> 16:29.071
No, Sylvie and I were just catching up.

16:29.154 --> 16:32.491
Oh. So glad to see everyone getting along.

16:33.534 --> 16:35.869
Sylvie, Julien and I
wanted to review the guest list

16:35.953 --> 16:37.538
for the Laboratoire Lavaux opening.

16:37.621 --> 16:38.914
Oh, sure.

16:38.998 --> 16:43.252
Okay, well, I am going to get out
of your hair and to the Louvre.

16:47.131 --> 16:50.175
Before my feet get too swollen.

16:50.676 --> 16:51.510
I'm, um…

16:52.428 --> 16:53.887
I'm so glad we had this talk.

16:53.971 --> 16:56.849
Yes, likewise. It was enlightening.

16:56.932 --> 16:57.933
Mmm.

16:59.309 --> 17:01.895
-See you at the party, Mads.
-Can't wait.

17:03.814 --> 17:05.816
Please just get out.

17:06.692 --> 17:07.901
-Out!
-Oh.

17:21.999 --> 17:25.335
Ooh, lavender.
Reminds me of my grandma, Mabel.

17:25.419 --> 17:26.503
Oh, that's sweet.

17:26.587 --> 17:28.547
I don't know
if you'd say that if you met her.

17:30.340 --> 17:31.341
<i>Et voilà.</i>

17:33.343 --> 17:35.596
Mmm. I like it.

17:35.679 --> 17:38.015
It's woodsy, down to earth. Just like you.

17:39.349 --> 17:40.768
Oh. Smell mine.

17:43.270 --> 17:45.397
-Ugh!
-Stop it!

17:45.481 --> 17:49.443
No, it smells good, of course.
It's, uh, sweet and warm.

17:49.526 --> 17:50.986
That's amber.

17:51.070 --> 17:52.321
It's you.

17:53.238 --> 17:54.990
Ah, did I miss the DIY class?

17:55.074 --> 17:55.908
-Hey.
-Hi.

17:55.991 --> 17:57.868
-You all right?
-What do you think?

17:57.951 --> 18:00.496
-Mmm. Is this Emily Cooper you're wearing?
-Mmm.

18:01.455 --> 18:03.665
Mmm. That's pretty intoxicating.

18:04.249 --> 18:05.209
Let me smell.

18:07.836 --> 18:08.962
Mmm.

18:09.546 --> 18:11.006
I think I love it.

18:11.090 --> 18:12.883
It seems obvious at first,

18:12.966 --> 18:16.303
but then there's something unexpected
under the surface.

18:27.689 --> 18:30.526
Beautiful event, Sylvie. <i>Magnifique.</i>

18:30.609 --> 18:32.694
Oh, I hope we're getting
plenty of content.

18:32.778 --> 18:34.696
I want to share this success with Chicago.

18:34.780 --> 18:38.283
Yes, Madeline. We have a very talented
photographer working the event.

18:38.867 --> 18:40.702
-Everything's under control.
<i>-Très bien.</i>

18:40.786 --> 18:43.705
Good evening, ladies. <i>Lavaux c'est nous.</i>

18:43.789 --> 18:44.748
<i>Absolument.</i>

18:44.832 --> 18:46.792
<i>Bonsoir,</i> Sylvie. Have you been well?

18:46.875 --> 18:47.918
Very well, thank you.

18:48.877 --> 18:50.754
Quite busy these days.

18:50.838 --> 18:53.048
Yeah, I'm sure work
is keeping you very busy.

18:53.132 --> 18:55.342
Madeline, may I introduce my wife?
Catherine Lambert.

18:55.425 --> 18:58.554
Oh, <i>enchantée.</i> Madeline Wheeler.
From the Gilbert Group.

18:58.637 --> 18:59.888
The Gilbert Group?

18:59.972 --> 19:01.390
Yeah, we own Savoir.

19:02.057 --> 19:05.435
Well, if you'll excuse me.
A pleasure, as always.

19:06.186 --> 19:10.023
You know, um, you're the reason
I discovered I was pregnant.

19:11.275 --> 19:15.112
I got a strong whiff of d'Allure
and threw up my açai bowl.

19:16.697 --> 19:18.323
And the rest is history.

19:18.824 --> 19:20.909
I'm honored to be
a small part of your journey.

19:21.618 --> 19:24.037
-The beauty of life growing inside you.
-Aw.

19:24.121 --> 19:25.789
Savoir is lucky to have such a woman.

19:25.873 --> 19:29.168
Oh, no, I am so lucky to be here,
working with such legends.

19:29.251 --> 19:32.629
You know, I would love Antoine
to get something on the books for us

19:32.713 --> 19:34.506
at Savoir, while I'm here.

19:34.590 --> 19:36.008
Oh, perhaps no one's told you,

19:36.091 --> 19:38.927
but we don't talk business
at parties in France.

19:39.011 --> 19:40.888
But this party is business.

19:40.971 --> 19:43.974
<i>Ma chérie,</i> if our guest wants to talk,
let her talk.

19:44.057 --> 19:45.434
How can we be of service?

19:45.517 --> 19:46.810
I'll cut to the chase.

19:46.894 --> 19:49.855
As senior manager
at the Gilbert Group, which owns Savoir,

19:50.439 --> 19:53.984
I mean, you have to know
that you are severely underpaying us.

19:54.067 --> 19:58.572
I mean, Antoine, look around.
Maison Lavaux is expanding

19:58.655 --> 20:01.783
and our fees need to mirror that growth.

20:02.367 --> 20:05.454
And we just can't afford
to keep going this way.

20:06.246 --> 20:07.372
Well, we have our reasons.

20:07.456 --> 20:09.750
I have a long-standing
arrangement with Savoir.

20:09.833 --> 20:10.834
So I've been told.

20:12.502 --> 20:13.754
Perhaps my wife is right.

20:13.837 --> 20:17.257
Maybe we should table this conversation
for a more appropriate time and place.

20:17.341 --> 20:20.761
Why don't you contact my assistant
and we'll discuss everything.

20:20.844 --> 20:21.720
I promise.

20:21.803 --> 20:24.097
If you'll excuse me,<i> la boutique…</i>

20:24.181 --> 20:25.182
By all means.

20:26.099 --> 20:28.352
You know what the arrangement is,
don't you?

20:28.435 --> 20:33.440
Uh, just that he had a personal
relationship with the previous owner.

20:34.441 --> 20:36.693
No, if only.

20:37.861 --> 20:41.240
Antoine was having an affair with Sylvie
for over three years.

20:42.241 --> 20:44.910
That's why she never
charged us the full rate.

20:44.993 --> 20:46.119
And you knew?

20:47.537 --> 20:48.455
About the affair?

20:48.538 --> 20:50.874
Well, knew, pretended not to know.

20:51.833 --> 20:54.378
As you say,
"Don't ask, don't tell." Right?

20:55.504 --> 20:58.799
But now that the affair is over,
you're raising your rates.

20:58.882 --> 21:01.510
It all sounds a little too coincidental.

21:01.593 --> 21:07.641
And I'm not sure any court of law
in this country would take kindly to that.

21:09.059 --> 21:11.228
And before you come after us,

21:11.311 --> 21:13.563
you should check to see with your company

21:13.647 --> 21:16.525
how much they're paying
that photographer she's sleeping with.

21:16.608 --> 21:17.818
Have a great evening.

21:30.330 --> 21:32.708
-We need to talk. Not here.
-I'll be right back.

21:34.293 --> 21:36.670
I think you're a good match for Emily.

21:36.753 --> 21:38.463
After all of that drama.

21:39.047 --> 21:42.718
I'm so glad to see things are settled now.
You know?

21:42.801 --> 21:43.802
Sure, uh…

21:44.928 --> 21:46.680
No. What do you mean?

21:46.763 --> 21:51.310
Just that whole fiasco with the chef
and the chef's girlfriend.

21:51.393 --> 21:54.896
I mean, that birthday party,
I thought someone was going to get killed.

21:56.273 --> 21:59.818
Everybody comes to Paris
and wants a ménage à trois.

22:00.861 --> 22:03.405
It's not as simple as it seems.

22:04.656 --> 22:06.616
Poor Emily, she couldn't have known

22:06.700 --> 22:10.037
that chef would bring her
all that drama and heartache.

22:11.538 --> 22:14.708
She's a good girl.
She deserves to be happy.

22:17.961 --> 22:19.629
-Are you talking about Gabriel?
-Yeah.

22:20.297 --> 22:22.299
Are you saying
something's going on between them?

22:22.382 --> 22:25.344
<i>Non.</i> <i>Non, non, non.</i>

22:25.427 --> 22:29.306
But sorry, you know,
my English is not so good.

22:29.389 --> 22:31.183
It sounds pretty good to me, mate.

22:31.266 --> 22:33.769
<i>Non, non, non.</i>
My English is terrible.

22:33.852 --> 22:35.437
I have no idea what I'm saying.

22:35.520 --> 22:37.439
<i>Attention…</i> Whoa… I…
What am I saying?

22:37.522 --> 22:39.775
I have to go to the bathroom.
Toilets, you know?

22:39.858 --> 22:41.943
Fuck!

22:42.027 --> 22:44.071
Forget, uh…

22:47.282 --> 22:48.617
I didn't know what to say.

22:48.700 --> 22:52.496
She used some sort of
weird French sexual logic on me

22:52.579 --> 22:53.663
to shut down my case.

22:53.747 --> 22:57.501
Emily, I'm… I'm just very freaked out.
I'm concerned.

22:57.584 --> 23:01.505
If this is real, I'm not even sure
that Sylvie should be working at the firm.

23:01.588 --> 23:03.590
I don't think
we should jump to any conclusions.

23:03.673 --> 23:06.676
I won't jump the gun. We need intel.
This could be the tip of the iceberg!

23:06.760 --> 23:08.720
Shouldn't you try
and talk to Sylvie first?

23:08.804 --> 23:11.014
-What?
-Maybe give her the benefit of the doubt.

23:11.098 --> 23:14.309
No, she's just gonna try to cover it up.
I'm gonna need your help.

23:14.393 --> 23:16.103
Me? What do you want me to do?

23:16.186 --> 23:19.231
You're friends with the tall one, right?
Luc? Is that his name?

23:19.314 --> 23:21.983
Try to get some
account billing information out of him.

23:22.067 --> 23:23.985
Oh, my God.

23:24.069 --> 23:26.947
Gilbert Group may have bought a company
that's cooked the books.

23:27.030 --> 23:29.908
I'm gonna have to stick around here
until I figure out what's going on.

23:33.286 --> 23:35.163
-Oh. Are you--
-No.

23:35.247 --> 23:38.125
Oh, I'm sorry. I don't feel well.
I've got to get out of here.

23:38.208 --> 23:39.376
I think it was the ambergris.

23:39.459 --> 23:41.795
Maybe we should
take things slow on this one.

23:42.421 --> 23:44.381
Oh, I know that look.

23:44.464 --> 23:47.843
Em, don't worry.
You're gonna be okay, no matter what.

23:47.926 --> 23:49.428
I got you, girl.

24:03.900 --> 24:06.153
<i>Mindy, sorry for being so messy.</i>

24:06.236 --> 24:09.114
<i>If it means anything,</i>
<i>Benoît finished your song.</i>

24:09.197 --> 24:10.866
<i>You still inspire him.</i>

25:06.046 --> 25:08.256
-Hey.
-Been looking for you.

25:08.340 --> 25:10.383
Sorry. Work crisis.

25:13.053 --> 25:15.931
Can I ask you something?
And you'll be honest?

25:16.640 --> 25:17.641
Of course.

25:18.141 --> 25:20.435
Was there something going on
between you and Gabriel?

25:20.519 --> 25:22.312
You told me you guys were just friends.

25:22.395 --> 25:25.023
Then I got an earful
from that mad scientist guy you work with.

25:25.815 --> 25:27.442
I'd rather just hear it from you.

25:29.110 --> 25:30.737
We had a moment.

25:32.197 --> 25:34.282
But it was nothing. Okay?

25:34.950 --> 25:36.952
It was over before it even began.

25:37.577 --> 25:38.453
You sure about that?

25:39.579 --> 25:42.374
'Cause I'm not interested in
playing second fiddle to some other guy.

25:43.083 --> 25:45.669
If that's the case, just tell me now.

25:46.711 --> 25:48.380
Didn't know you were the jealous type.

25:50.715 --> 25:54.511
Seriously, Gabriel is in the past.
We're just friends.

25:56.763 --> 25:57.597
Good.

25:58.306 --> 26:02.227
Because I hope that we're not
just playing games with each other

26:02.310 --> 26:04.312
because we're both in this foreign city

26:04.396 --> 26:07.691
and sometimes
things can seem a little unreal.

26:08.567 --> 26:12.195
Because the way
I'm starting to feel about you, for me,

26:13.738 --> 26:14.864
it is real.

26:16.866 --> 26:19.828
So however you feel, whatever you do,

26:21.621 --> 26:22.706
just tell me the truth.
