00:51.419 --> 00:53.287
I'VE GOTTA GET IN THE SHOWER.
- IRINA WAS TEXTING.

00:53.321 --> 00:55.189

00:55.223 --> 00:56.757
MWAH.

00:56.790 --> 00:59.193

01:09.137 --> 01:11.172

- NO FAIR.

01:11.205 --> 01:13.241
SHE TOOK YOU YESTERDAY.

01:13.274 --> 01:15.643
- NO, NO, IT'S NOT FAIR TO ME.
IT'S NEVER FAIR TO ME!

01:15.676 --> 01:17.645
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

01:17.678 --> 01:19.213
RUBY, CAN YOU DO MOMMY
A LITTLE FAVOR

01:19.247 --> 01:22.283
AND LET IRINA

01:22.316 --> 01:23.884
OKAY. THANK YOU.

01:23.917 --> 01:27.355
IRINA, YOU TAKE RUBY.
HERE'S HER BACKPACK.

01:27.388 --> 01:28.889
BUTTON UP YOUR COAT,
SWEETIE, COME ON.

01:28.922 --> 01:30.391

LET'S GO.
LET'S GO, HENRY, WE'RE LATE.

01:36.430 --> 01:39.433
- GO.

01:44.872 --> 01:48.376
- WHERE DOES IT HURT, RUBY?
- MY HEAD.

01:48.409 --> 01:49.277
- YOUR HEAD?

01:49.310 --> 01:52.246
OH. YOU HAVE A BUMP.

01:52.280 --> 01:55.349
- AND MY TUMMY HURTS.
CAN I HAVE A BAND-AID?

01:55.383 --> 01:57.385
- YOUR TUMMY?

01:57.418 --> 01:59.420
[gasps]
OH.

01:59.453 --> 02:01.189
THAT'S A BIG BOO-BOO.

02:01.222 --> 02:04.492
RUBY, HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?

02:06.394 --> 02:07.561
- A GOOD DETECTIVE LISTENS,

02:07.595 --> 02:10.831
HE PAYS ATTENTION,
HE ASKS THE RIGHT...

02:10.864 --> 02:11.832
QUESTIONS.

02:11.865 --> 02:14.868
- YOU EVER SHOOT ANYBODY?

02:14.902 --> 02:17.571
- NO, I'VE PULLED MY WEAPON.

02:17.605 --> 02:20.874
BUT POLICE WORK IS
MOSTLY ABOUT TALKING TO PEOPLE.

02:20.908 --> 02:22.910
- IS YOUR GUN EVEN REAL?
- YEAH, IT'S A REAL GUN.

02:22.943 --> 02:25.446
AND MY UNCLE NICK
KNOWS HOW TO USE IT.

02:25.479 --> 02:26.780
- DO YOU WEAR
A BULLETPROOF VEST?

02:26.814 --> 02:29.417
- ACTUALLY,
I HAVE ONE ON RIGHT NOW.

02:29.450 --> 02:30.951
LOOK AT THAT.
[knocks]

02:30.984 --> 02:32.620
WHEN YOU'RE ON DUTY,

02:32.653 --> 02:34.322
YOU SHOULD ALWAYS--
[cell phone rings]

02:34.355 --> 02:35.723
EXCUSE ME.

02:35.756 --> 02:38.459
AMARO.

02:38.492 --> 02:41.295
YEAH, I GOT IT.
I'M ON MY WAY.

02:41.329 --> 02:44.332
SORRY, KIDS.
MS. ROBINSON, I GOTTA GO.

02:44.365 --> 02:46.367

02:46.400 --> 02:48.402
WE'RE STILL SEEING THE RANGERS
TOMORROW NIGHT, RIGHT?

02:48.436 --> 02:50.204
- YOU BET, GIL.

02:50.238 --> 02:52.273

I'LL PICK YOU UP AT 6:00.

02:52.306 --> 02:54.742
- OKAY.
[elevator dings]

02:54.775 --> 02:57.378
- SORRY TO PULL YOU AWAY.
HOW'S YOUR SON?

02:57.411 --> 03:00.848
- GREAT. EXCEPT FOR THE FACT
HE DOESN'T KNOW HE'S MY SON.

03:00.881 --> 03:02.216
WHAT'S UP?

03:02.250 --> 03:03.451
- RUBY MESNER, FIVE.

03:03.484 --> 03:04.818
THE SCHOOL NURSE
FOUND BRUISING ON HER TORSO

03:04.852 --> 03:06.520
AND SWELLING ON HER HIP.

03:06.554 --> 03:08.556
DOCTOR SAYS
SHE HAS A CRACKED RIB

03:08.589 --> 03:10.324
THAT WAS SUFFERED
WITHIN THE LAST 12 HOURS.

03:10.358 --> 03:12.893
AND SOME OTHER MARKS.
THERE'S THE MOTHER.

03:12.926 --> 03:14.428
FATHER'S EN ROUTE
FROM HARTFORD.

03:14.462 --> 03:17.265
- I'LL TAKE MOM,
YOU GOT THE LITTLE GIRL.

03:17.298 --> 03:20.568
- SO CAN YOU TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED, RUBY?

03:20.601 --> 03:22.570
- I FELL.

03:22.603 --> 03:24.605
- YOU FELL?

03:24.638 --> 03:27.275
OKAY, WERE YOU ALONE
WHEN YOU FELL?

03:30.278 --> 03:33.847
CAN YOU TELL ME
WHO YOU WERE WITH, SWEETIE?

03:36.384 --> 03:38.619
- THE MONSTER.

03:38.652 --> 03:42.356
- A MONSTER?

03:42.390 --> 03:44.458
WHAT DID THE MONSTER DO?

03:46.560 --> 03:49.497
- THE MONSTER PUSHED ME.

04:48.522 --> 04:48.722
.

04:48.756 --> 04:49.523
- THE SCHOOL SAID
SHE WAS ALL RIGHT.

04:50.257 --> 04:51.191
WHY DID THE POLICE
GET CALLED?

04:51.224 --> 04:53.361
- UNEXPLAINED INJURIES.
PLEASE HAVE A SEAT.

04:53.394 --> 04:55.529
THEY'RE REQUIRED TO REPORT IT.
- BUT WE'RE NOT--[sighs]

04:55.563 --> 04:57.665
WE LIVE--WE LIVE
ON THE UPPER WEST SIDE.

04:57.698 --> 04:58.932
WE'RE GOOD PARENTS.

04:58.966 --> 05:00.701
- OKAY, LET'S START
WITH YOUR MORNING.

05:00.734 --> 05:03.904
THE NANNY, IRINA JANOVIC--
- MM-HMM.

05:03.937 --> 05:05.773
- SHE DROPPED RUBY OFF
AT PRESCHOOL?

05:05.806 --> 05:07.975
- THAT'S RIGHT.
MY HUSBAND LEFT FOR WORK.

05:08.008 --> 05:10.511
I TOOK OUR OLDER CHILD HENRY
TO HIS SCHOOL.

05:10.544 --> 05:12.380
- AND WHEN YOU LAST SAW RUBY,
HOW WAS SHE?

05:12.413 --> 05:13.947
- FINE. HENRY WAS THE ONE
HAVING THE MELTDOWN

05:13.981 --> 05:15.783
ABOUT IRINA
TAKING HIM TO SCHOOL,

05:15.816 --> 05:18.586
AND RUBY AGREED TO THE SWITCH--
- MRS. MESNER.

05:18.619 --> 05:21.755
I'M DETECTIVE BENSON.
UH, RUBY'S IN WITH THE DOCTOR.

05:21.789 --> 05:22.790
SHE'S OKAY.

05:22.823 --> 05:24.057
- DID SHE TELL YOU
WHAT HAPPENED?

05:24.091 --> 05:26.794
- I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD.
- NO.

05:26.827 --> 05:28.662
SHE WAS FINE WHEN I LEFT.

05:28.696 --> 05:30.798
- MRS. MESNER,

05:30.831 --> 05:32.833
YOU SAID HENRY DIDN'T WANT
THE NANNY TAKING HIM TO SCHOOL.

05:32.866 --> 05:35.803
- RIGHT. IRINA'S NEW.
SHE STARTED IN NOVEMBER.

05:35.836 --> 05:37.838
AND HE WANTED MOMMY.

05:37.871 --> 05:39.740
- HAVE YOU HAD
ANY PROBLEMS WITH HER?

05:39.773 --> 05:43.911
- UM, THERE'S BEEN SOME
MISCOMMUNICATION ABOUT HOURS.

05:43.944 --> 05:47.014
AND, YOU KNOW, I SHOULD TELL--
SHE'S ILLEGAL.

05:47.047 --> 05:48.382
- OKAY, WELL, WE'RE GONNA
NEED TO SPEAK WITH HER.

05:48.416 --> 05:49.817
IS SHE AT YOUR HOME?

05:49.850 --> 05:51.018
- NO, AFTER DROP-OFF

05:51.051 --> 05:53.120
SHE WORKS FOR ANOTHER FAMILY
IN THE BUILDING.

05:53.153 --> 05:54.488
- OKAY.

05:54.522 --> 05:56.590
RUBY'S VERY SWEET.

05:56.624 --> 05:58.392
- YEAH.

05:58.426 --> 06:00.528
- HAVE YOU NOTICED
ANY BEHAVIORAL CHANGES LATELY?

06:00.561 --> 06:03.130
- NO.

06:03.163 --> 06:05.132
RUBY'S MY EASY ONE.

06:05.165 --> 06:07.034
- ANY NIGHTMARES,
ANY BED-WETTING?

06:07.067 --> 06:08.736
- UM, W-WELL, AC--

06:08.769 --> 06:10.771
IRINA DID TELL ME SHE'S HAD
A COUPLE OF ACCIDENTS,

06:10.804 --> 06:12.673
BUT THAT HAPPENS.

06:12.706 --> 06:14.808
CAN I TAKE HER NOW?

06:14.842 --> 06:17.711
SHE HAS HER PIANO LESSON
AND HENRY HAS SWIM CLASS.

06:17.745 --> 06:20.781
- NO. YOU'RE GONNA NEED
TO CANCEL HER PIANO LESSON.

06:20.814 --> 06:24.618
AND WE'LL SEND SOMEONE
TO BRING HENRY HERE.

06:27.120 --> 06:29.823
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

06:29.857 --> 06:31.091
RUBY WAS FINE.

06:31.124 --> 06:33.594
SHE KEPT SAYING,
"I'M OKAY, I'M OKAY."

06:33.627 --> 06:34.995
- BUT SHE DID
GET HURT THIS MORNING.

06:35.028 --> 06:36.930
- SHE FELL DOWN
SOME STAIRS.

06:36.964 --> 06:39.467
LOOK, THE WOMAN I WORK FOR
WILL BE HOME SOON.

06:39.500 --> 06:41.702
- OKAY, TALK TO US
BEFORE SHE GETS HERE.

06:41.735 --> 06:45.773
- VIOLA WAS IN THE SHOWER.
UM, RUBY SPILLED MILK.

06:45.806 --> 06:48.976
I TOLD HER TO GO UPSTAIRS,
GET NEW TIGHTS.

06:49.009 --> 06:51.078
I WENT TO THE LAUNDRY ROOM,

06:51.111 --> 06:54.648
I HEARD RUBY CRY, I RAN BACK,
SHE WAS HALFWAY DOWN THE STAIRS.

06:54.682 --> 06:56.183
- SO YOU DIDN'T SEE HER FALL?
- NO.

06:56.216 --> 06:58.619
- IT'S WHAT SHE TOLD ME.

06:58.652 --> 07:00.821
I PUT THE BOO-BOO BUNNY
ON THE BRUISE.

07:00.854 --> 07:01.622
- AND YOU DIDN'T
TELL HER MOTHER?

07:01.655 --> 07:04.858
- NO.
SHE SAID SHE WASN'T HURT.

07:04.892 --> 07:07.027
AND I'M NOT SUPPOSED
TO LEAVE THE KIDS ALONE.

07:07.060 --> 07:10.230
- RUBY AND HENRY.
WHERE WAS HE?

07:10.263 --> 07:12.566
- HE DIDN'T EVEN
HEAR RUBY CRY.

07:12.600 --> 07:16.436
HE WAS EATING WAFFLES,
SMILING, HAPPY.

07:19.239 --> 07:20.474
- IRINA, WHAT'S GOING ON?

07:20.508 --> 07:22.710
THE DOORMAN SAID THERE WERE--
- YEAH, HI, DETECTIVE ROLLINS

07:22.743 --> 07:25.679
AND TUTUOLA.
[baby coos]

07:25.713 --> 07:28.716
- IS LUCY OKAY?
- YEAH.

07:28.749 --> 07:32.753
JUST A ROUTINE MATTER,
MA'AM.

07:32.786 --> 07:34.021
- RUBY MESNER, FIVE,

07:34.054 --> 07:35.823
PRESENTED WITH
SEVERE BRUISING ON HER TORSO

07:35.856 --> 07:37.725
AND A CRACKED RIB.

07:37.758 --> 07:39.627
SHE TOLD ME THAT A MONSTER
PUSHED HER DOWN THE STAIRS.

07:39.660 --> 07:40.861
- ANY HISTORY OF INCIDENTS?

07:40.894 --> 07:42.763
- WELL, FIRST REPORT
FROM THE PRESCHOOL,

07:42.796 --> 07:45.232
BUT HER EXAM SHOWED
SOME HEALED BRUISING

07:45.265 --> 07:46.867
AND AN OLD SPIRAL FRACTURE.

07:46.900 --> 07:49.069
- PLUS FOUR E.R. VISITS
IN THE LAST YEAR.

07:49.102 --> 07:51.705
SHE HAD A CONCUSSION
FROM A FALL,

07:51.739 --> 07:55.142
A FINGER PINCHED IN A DOOR,
AND TWO SKULL BURNS.

07:55.175 --> 07:57.110
- WHAT DO WE KNOW
ABOUT THE FAMILY?

07:57.144 --> 07:58.712
- VIOLA AND TOM MESNER.
SHE'S AN AMEX VP.

07:58.746 --> 08:01.081
HE'S A SYSTEMS ENGINEER
WITH AMTRAK.

08:01.114 --> 08:02.816
MARRIED 14 YEARS.

08:02.850 --> 08:04.752
OLDER SON HENRY IS TEN.
NO D.V. REPORTS.

08:04.785 --> 08:06.587
- THE NANNY CLAIMED
SHE WAS DOING LAUNDRY

08:06.620 --> 08:08.055
WHEN RUBY
FELL DOWN THE STAIRS.

08:08.088 --> 08:09.523
- IRINA JANOVIC.

08:09.557 --> 08:11.058
HERE ILLEGALLY
FROM SOVIET GEORGIA.

08:11.091 --> 08:12.893
SHE'S WORKED FOR THE MESNERS
FOR FIVE MONTHS.

08:12.926 --> 08:14.795
- THAT'S ALL BUT ONE
OF RUBY'S E.R. VISITS.

08:14.828 --> 08:16.797
- IRINA ALSO WORKS
FOR ANOTHER FAMILY.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.799
THAT MOTHER HASN'T
REPORTED ANY PROBLEMS.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.601
- OKAY, ANY ISSUES
WITH HER STORY?

08:20.634 --> 08:22.636
- SHE SAID SHE DIDN'T SEE
WHAT HAPPENED.

08:22.670 --> 08:24.838
SHE ALSO DIDN'T
TELL THE MOTHER.

08:24.872 --> 08:27.641
- ANYONE ELSE AROUND
WHEN RUBY FELL?

08:27.675 --> 08:29.610
- THE FATHER HAD GONE TO WORK,
MOTHER WAS IN THE SHOWER.

08:29.643 --> 08:32.813
IRINA SAID THAT HENRY,
THE BROTHER, WAS AT THE TABLE.

08:32.846 --> 08:34.882
- LET'S TALK TO HIM
AND EXAMINE HIM.

08:34.915 --> 08:36.283
TWO PARENTS,
AN OLDER BROTHER, A NANNY,

08:36.316 --> 08:37.951
AND NOBODY'S LOOKING OUT
FOR THE GIRL?

08:37.985 --> 08:40.821
LET'S TALK TO THE NEIGHBORS,
TEACHERS, DOORMEN,

08:40.854 --> 08:44.291
AND KEEP THE TWO KIDS AT THE CAC
UNTIL WE SORT THIS OUT.

08:48.696 --> 08:49.897
- I WAS EATING WAFFLES

08:49.930 --> 08:52.833
JUST BEFORE I HEARD
RUBY YELL UPSTAIRS.

08:52.866 --> 08:54.134
- AND WHERE WERE YOU, HENRY?

08:54.167 --> 08:55.969
- AT THE TABLE,
EATING MY WAFFLES.

08:56.003 --> 09:00.608
- GOOD.
AND WHERE WAS IRINA?

09:00.641 --> 09:03.911
- DID YOU SEE IRINA, HENRY?

09:03.944 --> 09:06.313
- I DON'T THINK I SHOULD
TALK ABOUT IT.

09:06.346 --> 09:08.181
- LOOK, IT'S OKAY, HENRY.

09:08.215 --> 09:10.183
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
GET IN ANY TROUBLE.

09:10.217 --> 09:11.919
JUST TELL US WHAT YOU SAW.

09:11.952 --> 09:15.155
- WELL,
WHEN I HEARD RUBY YELL,

09:15.188 --> 09:18.025
I GOT UP AND I WENT
INTO THE LIVING ROOM.

09:18.058 --> 09:21.228
AND THEN I SAW HER AND IRINA
AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS.

09:21.261 --> 09:22.730
- AND WHAT WERE THEY DOING?

09:22.763 --> 09:24.331
- IRINA WAS TRYING
TO GET RUBY'S TIGHTS ON,

09:24.364 --> 09:26.333
AND RUBY WAS CRANKY.

09:26.366 --> 09:30.838
- AND THEN WHAT HAPPENED?

09:30.871 --> 09:32.305
HENRY.

09:32.339 --> 09:34.708
IT'S OKAY.

09:34.742 --> 09:37.344
JUST TELL US WHAT HAPPENED.

09:37.377 --> 09:42.950
- IRINA MADE HER MAD FACE
AND PUSHED RUBY DOWN THE STAIRS.

09:42.983 --> 09:46.253
- AND YOU'RE SURE
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAW, HENRY?

09:46.286 --> 09:48.055
MAYBE IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

09:48.088 --> 09:49.857
- NO, IT WASN'T.

09:49.890 --> 09:53.761
IRINA TOLD RUBY TO SHUT UP,
AND THEN SHE PUSHED HER.

09:53.794 --> 09:55.863
SAYING "SHUT UP" IS NOT NICE.

09:55.896 --> 09:57.364
- OKAY.

09:57.397 --> 09:58.932
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENED?

09:58.966 --> 10:02.102
- THEN I RAN BACK
TO THE TABLE.

10:02.135 --> 10:04.304
IRINA CAME IN
AND GOT THE ICE BUNNY.

10:04.337 --> 10:06.406
I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

10:06.439 --> 10:09.743
PLEASE DON'T TELL MY MOM.

10:09.777 --> 10:14.381
DAD ALWAYS GETS MAD
WHEN WE HAVE TO SWITCH NANNIES.

10:14.414 --> 10:18.051
- HE'S TEN.
IS HE SWEARABLE, COUNSELOR?

10:18.085 --> 10:20.888
- A LOT OF DETAIL.
LINEAR.

10:20.921 --> 10:23.791
FOR OUR SAKE HE IS.
WE'LL SEE WHAT THE JUDGE RULES.

10:23.824 --> 10:25.793
IRINA'S ILLEGAL?
- YEAH.

10:25.826 --> 10:27.394
- PICK HER UP.

10:27.427 --> 10:28.796
WE DON'T NEED
ANOTHER "BAD NANNY" HEADLINE.

10:28.829 --> 10:30.831
- WHAT ABOUT THE MESNERS?

10:30.864 --> 10:32.132
- WELL, ONCE WE GET HENRY'S
FULL STATEMENT,

10:32.165 --> 10:34.968
THEY CAN TAKE
THEIR CHILDREN HOME.

10:38.906 --> 10:40.908
- MY SON TOBY
PLAYS WITH HENRY.

10:40.941 --> 10:42.342
THE NANNY DROPS HIM OFF.

10:42.375 --> 10:44.277
- YOU EVER NOTICE
ANY PROBLEMS?

10:44.311 --> 10:46.313
- WHAT NANNY ARE WE TALKING
ABOUT? THEY'VE HAD SO MANY.

10:46.346 --> 10:48.749
- DAD, THE XBOX IS JAMMED.

10:48.782 --> 10:50.718
- TOBY, YOU KNOW
HENRY'S NANNY'S NAME?

10:50.751 --> 10:51.952
- THE NEW ONE?
- MM-HMM.

10:51.985 --> 10:52.953
- IRINA.

10:52.986 --> 10:54.855
SHE'S ALWAYS TEXTING.

10:54.888 --> 10:57.324
HENRY HATES HER.

10:57.357 --> 10:58.892
- ARE THESE THE TIGHTS
WITH THE MILK SPILL?

10:58.926 --> 11:01.729
- YES. IRINA SAID
SHE RINSED THEM OUT.

11:01.762 --> 11:03.396
THIS IS A NIGHTMARE.

11:03.430 --> 11:07.134
SHE HAD REFERENCES.
- DID YOU KNOW ANY OF THEM?

11:07.167 --> 11:10.303
- MOSTLY MOMS' GROUPS
ON THE INTERNET.

11:10.337 --> 11:14.074
- OKAY, WE'RE GONNA NEED
TO GET IN CONTACT WITH THEM.

11:14.107 --> 11:15.909
- YOU TRY AND DO THE BEST
FOR YOUR KIDS.

11:15.943 --> 11:17.477
BUT THERE'S SO MUCH
OUT OF YOUR CONTROL, YOU KNOW?

11:17.510 --> 11:19.312
- AND NEITHER YOU
NOR YOUR WIFE

11:19.346 --> 11:21.915
HAVE EVER SEEN OR HEARD
IRINA BEING ABUSIVE?

11:21.949 --> 11:23.917
- I HAVEN'T SPENT
MUCH TIME WITH HER.

11:23.951 --> 11:25.285
[cell phone vibrates]

11:25.318 --> 11:27.687
EXCUSE ME.

11:29.957 --> 11:32.225
- [sighs]

12:21.574 --> 12:23.811
- WHAT HAPPENED
WITH RUBY THIS MORNING?

12:23.844 --> 12:26.313
- IRINA, YOU ARE
IN TROUBLE HERE, WITH US,

12:26.346 --> 12:29.282
WITH THE INS, HELP YOURSELF--
- I TOLD YOU SHE FELL!

12:29.316 --> 12:30.918
- OKAY, MAYBE IT WAS
JUST AN ACCIDENT,

12:30.951 --> 12:31.919
AND YOU WERE TRYING TO HELP.

12:31.952 --> 12:35.555
- NO. I TOLD YOU,
I WAS IN THE LAUNDRY ROOM.

12:35.588 --> 12:38.458
- HENRY TOLD US
HE SAW YOU PUSH HER.

12:38.491 --> 12:42.229
- HENRY SAID THAT?

12:42.262 --> 12:43.864
NO.

12:43.897 --> 12:45.866
HE IS A MEAN LITTLE BOY.

12:45.899 --> 12:50.270
RUBY CALLS HIM
"THE MONSTER."

12:50.303 --> 12:52.505
- [playing piano]
- BEDTIME IN FIVE MINUTES.

12:52.539 --> 12:54.041
- YES, MOMMY.

12:54.074 --> 12:57.277
- YOU TOO, HENRY.
[video game beeping]

12:57.310 --> 12:58.979
RUBY'S ALL THUMBS,
BUT SHE LOVES IT.

12:59.012 --> 13:01.248
- YEAH. HENRY NOT SO MUCH?
- OH...

13:01.281 --> 13:03.984
YOU KNOW,
BOYS CAN BE A HANDFUL.

13:04.017 --> 13:06.153
MY HUSBAND WAS--
WAS LIKE THAT.

13:06.186 --> 13:07.855
BUT HE GREW OUT OF IT.

13:07.888 --> 13:11.992
- MRS. MESNER, DOES HENRY
EVER PLAY GAMES WITH RUBY?

13:12.025 --> 13:15.829
LIKE "MONSTER"?

13:15.863 --> 13:18.165
- "MONSTER."
YES, SOMETIMES.

13:18.198 --> 13:20.067
- DOES HE RESENT
HAVING A LITTLE SISTER?

13:20.100 --> 13:21.401
- OH, YES,
THE SCHOOL GUIDANCE COUNSELOR

13:21.434 --> 13:23.370
CALLS IT
"FIRSTBORN SYNDROME."

13:23.403 --> 13:26.539
I ASKED HENRY
IF HE DID THIS.

13:26.573 --> 13:29.977
HE CRIED, AND HE SWORE
HE SAW IRINA PUSH HER.

13:30.010 --> 13:32.545
- YEAH, THAT'S WHAT HE TOLD ME,
BUT, UM...

13:32.579 --> 13:34.547
BUT I HAVE TO ASK.

13:34.581 --> 13:37.851
HAS HENRY EVER
LIED TO YOU BEFORE?

13:37.885 --> 13:40.087
- [sighs]

13:40.120 --> 13:42.289
- NOW, THOSE OTHER ACCIDENTS
RUBY HAD...

13:42.322 --> 13:43.857
WAS HENRY IN THE APARTMENT?

13:43.891 --> 13:47.627
- ONE TIME RUBY GOT HER FINGER
STUCK IN THE DOOR,

13:47.660 --> 13:49.629
AND SHE WAS SCREAMING.

13:49.662 --> 13:53.967
TOM AND I RACED UP THE STAIRS,
AND HENRY WAS THERE...

13:54.001 --> 13:57.237
IN HIS ROOM, SMILING.

13:57.270 --> 13:59.306
- SO...

13:59.339 --> 14:02.209
IT IS POSSIBLE...

14:02.242 --> 14:06.646
THAT HENRY PUSHED RUBY
DOWN THE STAIRS.

14:06.679 --> 14:10.217
- OH, GOD.

14:10.250 --> 14:11.919
HE DIDN'T MEAN TO.
HE JUST--

14:35.442 --> 14:35.642
.

14:35.675 --> 14:36.043
- HENRY.
HENRY.

14:41.714 --> 14:43.683
HENRY.

14:43.716 --> 14:45.385
- IT'S OKAY, HENRY.

14:45.418 --> 14:49.122
DETECTIVE AMARO JUST WANTS
TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO RUBY.

14:49.156 --> 14:51.524
- YOU MEAN
YOU THINK I'M A LIAR?

14:54.194 --> 14:57.530
- [sighs]
MAYBE YOU WERE SCARED

14:57.564 --> 15:02.002
YOU'D GET IN TROUBLE
FOR HURTING YOUR SISTER.

15:02.035 --> 15:03.937
- YOU'RE RECORDING THIS?

15:03.971 --> 15:08.008
- YES, SO YOU WON'T HAVE TO
ANSWER THE SAME QUESTIONS AGAIN.

15:09.609 --> 15:13.313
- SHE STOPPED CRYING.
IT DIDN'T HURT HER.

15:13.346 --> 15:14.714
- "IT."

15:14.747 --> 15:16.449
YOU MEAN PUSHING HER
DOWN THE STAIRS?

15:16.483 --> 15:17.985
- YEAH.

15:18.018 --> 15:20.453
SHE STARTED CRYING.
IRINA CAME OVER.

15:20.487 --> 15:23.623
SHE STOPPED CRYING.
IT MUST HAVE NOT HURT HER.

15:23.656 --> 15:26.593
- HENRY SPILLED MY MILK
AND BLAMED ME.

15:26.626 --> 15:28.728
- AND THAT'S
WHEN IRINA TOLD YOU

15:28.761 --> 15:31.631
TO GO UPSTAIRS
AND GET A NEW PAIR OF TIGHTS.

15:31.664 --> 15:33.533
- UH-HUH.

15:33.566 --> 15:36.536
WHEN I CAME BACK,
HE WAS HIDING.

15:36.569 --> 15:40.007
HE JUMPED OUT,
SCREAMED "BOO!" REAL LOUD,

15:40.040 --> 15:41.474
AND PUSHED ME.

15:41.508 --> 15:43.343
- AND YOU'RE SURE
HE PUSHED YOU, SWEETIE?

15:43.376 --> 15:45.545
- MAYBE HE WAS
PLAYING "MONSTER."

15:45.578 --> 15:49.682
- NO, BECAUSE THIS TIME
HE HAD HIS ARM OUT.

15:49.716 --> 15:51.651
LIKE THIS.

15:51.684 --> 15:53.987
INTO MY FACE.

15:54.021 --> 15:56.689
- WASN'T THAT HARD.
IT WAS MORE OF A JOSTLE.

15:56.723 --> 16:01.561
- SO WHEN YOU JOSTLED RUBY,
WERE YOU MAD AT HER?

16:01.594 --> 16:05.298
- NO. I JUST DON'T LIKE HER.
IN FACT, I HATE HER.

16:05.332 --> 16:06.733
- HENRY.

16:06.766 --> 16:08.301
DON'T SAY THAT.

16:08.335 --> 16:12.539
- YOU WANT ME TO LIE?

16:12.572 --> 16:13.773
I WASN'T MAD.

16:13.806 --> 16:16.243
IT WAS AN EXPERIMENT.

16:16.276 --> 16:18.645
- HOW DO YOU MEAN, HENRY?

16:18.678 --> 16:21.148
- I WANTED TO SEE
IF SHE'D ROLL ALL THE WAY DOWN

16:21.181 --> 16:22.582
OR JUST STOP.

16:22.615 --> 16:26.286
SHE ROLLED MOST OF THE WAY.
HEAD OVER LEGS.

16:26.319 --> 16:30.657
SHE WAS ON AN ANGLE, SO SHE
HIT THE LANDING AND STOPPED.

16:35.328 --> 16:37.664
- SO, RUBY,

16:37.697 --> 16:40.667
HAS HENRY EVER
HURT YOU BEFORE?

16:40.700 --> 16:42.302
- SOMETIMES WHEN I HUG HIM

16:42.335 --> 16:46.373
HE THROWS MY GUSSY OUT
OR SLAMS THE DOOR ON ME.

16:46.406 --> 16:50.810
- DID YOU EVER
TELL YOUR MOM OR YOUR DAD?

16:50.843 --> 16:54.181
- CAN WE STOP?

16:54.214 --> 16:56.549
I DON'T WANT
HENRY TO BE IN TROUBLE.

16:56.583 --> 16:57.717
I LOVE HIM.

16:57.750 --> 16:59.686
- SURE WE CAN, SWEETIE.

16:59.719 --> 17:02.322
YOU KNOW,
I NOTICED YOU LIKE PUZZLES.

17:02.355 --> 17:05.425
- YEAH, COME ON.
COME HELP ME PICK ONE OUT.

17:05.458 --> 17:06.593
- IT'S OKAY.

17:06.626 --> 17:07.560
IT'S OKAY, HONEY.
GO ON.

17:07.594 --> 17:09.596
- HERE.

17:16.169 --> 17:17.537
- HIS GUIDANCE COUNSELOR
AT SCHOOL

17:17.570 --> 17:19.272
TOLD US TO LET THEM
WORK IT OUT.

17:19.306 --> 17:20.607
IF WE INTERVENE,

17:20.640 --> 17:23.610
WE REWARD HENRY WITH ATTENTION
FOR BAD BEHAVIOR.

17:23.643 --> 17:25.412
- UH...

17:25.445 --> 17:29.482
HE SEEMS TO HAVE
A LOT OF RAGE.

17:29.516 --> 17:31.718
- SO DID I
WHEN I WAS HIS AGE.

17:31.751 --> 17:36.123
AND THEN I GOT INTO TRAINS,
AND I WAS FINE.

17:36.156 --> 17:39.759
HENRY JUST NEEDS
TO FIND HIS THING.

17:42.495 --> 17:44.331
- HENRY HAS ISSUES.

17:44.364 --> 17:47.400
BUT IT'S NOT
CLEAR-CUT A.D.D. OR O.C.D.

17:47.434 --> 17:49.536
OR OPPOSITIONAL
DEFIANT DISORDER.

17:49.569 --> 17:51.571
- ARE YOU A PSYCHOLOGIST,
MS. SCHWARTZ?

17:51.604 --> 17:53.473
- I'M WORKING TOWARD THAT.

17:53.506 --> 17:55.808
I HAVE A MASTER'S
IN SCHOOL COUNSELING.

17:55.842 --> 17:58.845
- SO HENRY STARTED HERE
AT FREMONT IN THE FOURTH GRADE?

17:58.878 --> 18:00.747
- THE MESNERS SAID
THEY FELT HIS OLD SCHOOL

18:00.780 --> 18:02.682
WAS TOO ORIENTED
TOWARD TESTING.

18:02.715 --> 18:05.418
THEY WANTED
A MORE OPEN DYNAMIC.

18:05.452 --> 18:07.587
- "OPEN."
MEANING LESS STRICT?

18:07.620 --> 18:10.490
- WELL, WE TRY
TO BRAINSTORM SOLUTIONS

18:10.523 --> 18:12.125
SO THAT THE CHILDREN LEARN

18:12.159 --> 18:14.227
TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY
FOR THEIR BEHAVIOR.

18:14.261 --> 18:15.695
- AND HOW'S THAT
WORKING FOR HENRY?

18:15.728 --> 18:18.598
- SOME DAYS I THINK
WE'VE TURNED A CORNER.

18:18.631 --> 18:22.602
AND THEN THE NEXT DAY HE'LL
THROW A DESK OR SLAM HIS LOCKER.

18:22.635 --> 18:24.804
HE'S VERY SMART.

18:24.837 --> 18:27.907
I THINK
HE'S JUST TESTING US.

18:27.940 --> 18:29.776
- HAVE YOU EVER
HAD HIM TESTED?

18:29.809 --> 18:31.578
SENT HIM
TO SEE A PSYCHIATRIST?

18:31.611 --> 18:34.881
- THE MESNERS ARE WORRIED
ABOUT HIM BEING LABELED.

18:34.914 --> 18:37.450
WE ONLY GO UP
TO FIFTH GRADE HERE,

18:37.484 --> 18:39.152
AND YOU KNOW
MIDDLE SCHOOL COMPETITION.

18:39.186 --> 18:40.720
- AND HOW ABOUT MEDS?

18:40.753 --> 18:43.690
DOES HE SEE
A PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGIST?

18:43.723 --> 18:45.892
- I WORK CLOSELY
WITH HIS PEDIATRICIAN.

18:45.925 --> 18:47.827
WE'VE TRIED
VARIOUS APPROACHES.

18:47.860 --> 18:50.797
- ADDERALL, RITALIN, STRATTERA.
- ALL OF THOSE.

18:50.830 --> 18:54.267
AND SOME SCHIZOAFFECTIVE ONES,
ANTIDEPRESSANTS.

18:54.301 --> 18:55.835
WE'LL FIND
THE RIGHT COMBINATION.

18:55.868 --> 18:58.471
- HAS HENRY EVER HURT
ANY KIDS HERE AT THIS SCHOOL?

18:58.505 --> 19:02.542
- AT FIRST, BUT HE KNOWS NOW
THAT BEHAVIOR IS UNACCEPTABLE.

19:02.575 --> 19:04.511
HE'S SO BRIGHT.

19:04.544 --> 19:05.812
HE GETS BORED.

19:05.845 --> 19:09.749
WE SPELL OUT THE RULES,
HE LOOKS FOR LOOPHOLES.

19:09.782 --> 19:10.850
- IF THIS KID
WERE THAT TROUBLED,

19:10.883 --> 19:12.585
THERE SHOULD BE
MORE OF A PAPER TRAIL.

19:12.619 --> 19:14.321
- IF HE LIVED
IN THE PROJECTS,

19:14.354 --> 19:16.556
HE'D HAVE BEEN IN THE SYSTEM
TEN TIMES BY NOW.

19:16.589 --> 19:19.359
- HE'S GOT
HIS GUIDANCE COUNSELOR SNOWED.

19:19.392 --> 19:21.728
THE PARENTS HAVE HER
PRESCRIBING HIM MEDS ON THE QT

19:21.761 --> 19:24.297
BECAUSE THEY REFUSE
TO GET HIM TESTED.

19:24.331 --> 19:25.732
- WELL, THEY'RE JUST
TRYING TO PROTECT HIM.

19:25.765 --> 19:27.634
LOOK, A BAD DIAGNOSIS
STAYS ON HIS RECORD.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.636
- MEANWHILE,
HENRY NEEDS HELP.

19:29.669 --> 19:30.770
- IS HE BACK HOME NOW?
- YES.

19:30.803 --> 19:32.439
- WHEN YOU WERE THERE,

19:32.472 --> 19:34.607
DID YOU SEE ANY SIGNS
OF NEGLECT OR PARENTAL ABUSE?

19:34.641 --> 19:35.608
- NO.

19:35.642 --> 19:36.709
IT WAS A CLEAN HOUSE,

19:36.743 --> 19:38.745
REFRIGERATOR
FULL OF ORGANIC FOOD.

19:38.778 --> 19:40.713
LOOK, THEY'RE GOOD, WORKING
PARENTS WHO LOVE THEIR KIDS,

19:40.747 --> 19:42.449
BUT COUNSELOR--

19:42.482 --> 19:43.683
- THEN HOME IS PROBABLY
THE BEST PLACE FOR HENRY.

19:43.716 --> 19:45.552
- OKAY, SO LET ME JUST
GET THIS STRAIGHT.

19:45.585 --> 19:46.886
SO YOU'RE SAYING
BECAUSE THE HOME IS NEAT

19:46.919 --> 19:50.590
THEN WE SHOULD ALL PRETEND
THAT IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

19:50.623 --> 19:51.924
RUBY SAID THAT
HE STRAIGHT-ARMED HER.

19:51.958 --> 19:53.526
- DETECTIVE.

19:53.560 --> 19:54.727
YOU WANT ME TO LOCK UP

19:54.761 --> 19:56.596
EVERY BIG BROTHER
WHO HURTS HIS SISTER?

19:56.629 --> 19:57.830
HE'S TEN.
- OH, MY--

19:57.864 --> 19:59.932
- SHE'S FIVE.

19:59.966 --> 20:01.434
YOU ASK THEM WHAT HAPPENED
THREE MORE TIMES,

20:01.468 --> 20:02.735
YOU'LL GET
THREE DIFFERENT ANSWERS.

20:02.769 --> 20:04.771
- OKAY, LET'S EVERYBODY
JUST TAKE A BREATH.

20:04.804 --> 20:06.539
COUNSELOR, ARE YOU SAYING
WE CAN'T CHARGE THE KID?

20:06.573 --> 20:07.774
- I'M NOT GOING TO.

20:07.807 --> 20:09.742
AND IF YOU THINK
A JUVENILE DETENTION FACILITY

20:09.776 --> 20:11.010
WILL HELP TURN THINGS
AROUND FOR HIM--

20:11.043 --> 20:12.712
- OKAY, HOLD ON, HOLD ON.

20:12.745 --> 20:14.714
THEY DON'T WANT HENRY
TO HAVE A RECORD.

20:14.747 --> 20:16.949
WHAT IF WE TELL THEM THAT
THE D.A. MIGHT LET THIS SLIDE

20:16.983 --> 20:19.386
IF HENRY SEES A SHRINK?

20:19.419 --> 20:21.421
- YOU WANNA GIVE THAT A TRY,
GO AHEAD.

20:25.492 --> 20:27.760
- GO TALK TO THE MESNERS.

20:27.794 --> 20:30.463
- CAPTAIN, I'M ALREADY
RUNNING LATE.

20:30.497 --> 20:32.765
- RIGHT. RIGHT.
ROLLINS.

20:32.799 --> 20:34.467
- YEAH. I'M GOOD TO GO.

20:34.501 --> 20:36.603
- THANKS.

20:36.636 --> 20:37.870
- NO. WE AGREED ON THIS.

20:37.904 --> 20:39.939
YOU WERE A FRIEND
OF MY BROTHER'S.

20:39.972 --> 20:41.441
HE CAN CALL YOU
"UNCLE NICK."

20:41.474 --> 20:42.875
THAT'S THE DEAL.

20:42.909 --> 20:44.911
- I KNOW THAT'S WHAT WE SAID,
BUT IT'S A LIE.

20:44.944 --> 20:46.613
AND KEEPING THIS HIDDEN--

20:46.646 --> 20:48.548
GIL HAS ENOUGH SECRETS
IN HIS LIFE, ALL RIGHT?

20:48.581 --> 20:49.982
HE HAS A HALF-SISTER
HE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT.

20:50.016 --> 20:52.719
- OUT OF NOWHERE YOU WANT
TO TELL HIM ALL OF THIS.

20:52.752 --> 20:54.621
IT'S TOO MUCH.

20:54.654 --> 20:57.524
AND HOW DO I KNOW THAT YOU WON'T
JUST DISAPPEAR ON HIM AGAIN?

20:57.557 --> 21:00.293
- I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE,
CYNTHIA...RIGHT?

21:00.327 --> 21:01.761
AND THE LONGER WE WAIT,
THE WORSE IT'LL--

21:01.794 --> 21:03.029
- HEY.

21:05.732 --> 21:08.067
LOOK WHAT NICK GOT ME.
PERFECT FIT.

21:08.100 --> 21:10.470
- SAY THANK YOU
TO UNCLE NICK.

21:10.503 --> 21:11.771
- IT'S WAY COOL.

21:11.804 --> 21:13.406
- LOOKS GREAT.
- COME ON.

21:13.440 --> 21:14.874
WE DON'T WANNA
MISS THE INTRODUCTIONS.

21:14.907 --> 21:18.411
- I'LL CALL YOU
FROM THE GAME.

21:18.445 --> 21:19.712
- PSYCHIATRIST?

21:19.746 --> 21:21.648
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

21:21.681 --> 21:22.715
I DON'T WANT HENRY
TURNING INTO

21:22.749 --> 21:25.084
ONE OF THOSE
DRUG-CONTROLLED ROBOTS.

21:25.117 --> 21:26.653
TELL THEM ABOUT THE LITHIUM.

21:26.686 --> 21:27.887
- YEAH, HE--
HE GAINED WEIGHT,

21:27.920 --> 21:29.922
AND HE WAS PUFFY
AND BLANK BEHIND THE EYES.

21:29.956 --> 21:31.591
HE WASN'T HENRY.

21:31.624 --> 21:33.426
- WE ARE JUST TALKING
ABOUT AN EVALUATION.

21:33.460 --> 21:34.461
- NO.

21:34.494 --> 21:37.364
HE'LL BE OKAY. YOU--

21:37.397 --> 21:38.765
YOU PEOPLE DON'T KNOW HIM.

21:38.798 --> 21:40.367
WE DO.

21:40.400 --> 21:42.335
- AND WE HAVE ALL THE BOOKS
ON DEFIANT KIDS.

21:42.369 --> 21:44.404
WE WILL FIND
THE RIGHT STRATEGY.

21:44.437 --> 21:46.673
- MR. AND MRS. MESNER,

21:46.706 --> 21:48.408
YOUR DAUGHTER IS NOT SAFE.

21:48.441 --> 21:50.377
- WE'VE TAKEN PRECAUTIONS.

21:50.410 --> 21:52.545
WE'VE LOCKED UP
ALL THE SHARP OBJECTS.

21:52.579 --> 21:54.514
HENRY WILL NEVER BE
LEFT ALONE WITH RUBY AGAIN.

21:54.547 --> 21:55.648
- AND HOW CAN YOU BE SURE?

21:55.682 --> 21:58.651
NANNIES NEED BREAKS.
EVERYONE DOES.

21:58.685 --> 22:01.721
- I'LL BE HERE. I'VE TAKEN
A LEAVE OF ABSENCE FROM WORK.

22:01.754 --> 22:03.656
I WILL BE HERE TO MAKE SURE
HENRY GETS ALL THE ATTENTION

22:03.690 --> 22:05.124
AND THE LOVE HE NEEDS.

22:05.157 --> 22:07.660
- THE D.A.--I'M NOT SURE
SHE'S GONNA LET THIS SLIDE.

22:07.694 --> 22:09.562
- OH, SHE'LL HAVE TO.

22:09.596 --> 22:11.398
I SPOKE TO ANOTHER PARENT
WHO'S AN ATTORNEY.

22:11.431 --> 22:14.634
HE SAID THAT IF THE D.A. DECIDES
TO PRESS CHARGES,

22:14.667 --> 22:17.036
HE'D SUE THE CITY,
FOR FREE.

22:17.069 --> 22:19.005
- MR. MESNER,
I DON'T THINK YOU UNDERSTAND.

22:19.038 --> 22:21.007
- OH, I THINK I COMPLETELY
UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

22:21.040 --> 22:22.742
- TOM, NO, PLEASE.

22:22.775 --> 22:24.777
DETECTIVES, WE--WE DON'T
WANT YOU TO HAVE TO COME BACK.

22:24.811 --> 22:28.915
WE WILL TAKE CARE OF HENRY.
WE GIVE YOU OUR WORD.

22:36.989 --> 22:39.592
- ARE THEY GONE YET?

22:39.626 --> 22:41.561
- YES, THEY JUST LEFT.

22:41.594 --> 22:43.930
- I DON'T WANT
TO SEE THEM AGAIN.

22:43.963 --> 22:47.066
- WELL,
THAT'S UP TO YOU, HENRY.

22:47.099 --> 22:51.671
YOU KNOW THAT YOUR BEHAVIOR
HAS CONSEQUENCES.

22:51.704 --> 22:53.506
IF YOU CAN JUST
REMEMBER TO USE YOUR WORDS

22:53.540 --> 22:56.643
RATHER THAN SCREAMING
AND USING YOUR HANDS,

22:56.676 --> 23:00.613
YOU'LL GET TO DO
THE THINGS YOU LIKE.

23:00.647 --> 23:03.716
- I KNOW.
I'M SORRY, MOMMY.

23:07.787 --> 23:09.889
- IT'S OKAY.
LET'S TALK MORE IN THE MORNING.

23:09.922 --> 23:11.057
IT'S PAST BEDTIME.

23:11.090 --> 23:12.492
- BUT I'M NOT TIRED.

23:12.525 --> 23:14.193
- HENRY, IT'S LATE.

23:14.226 --> 23:16.062
- I SAID I'M NOT TIRED.

23:16.095 --> 23:19.966
- LIE DOWN,
AND I'M GONNA GIVE YOU KISSES.

23:19.999 --> 23:23.803
- I SAID NO.

23:27.106 --> 23:29.776
- HENRY...

23:29.809 --> 23:32.645
YOU GIVE ME
THAT KNIFE RIGHT NOW.

23:57.670 --> 23:57.870
.

23:57.904 --> 23:58.538
- MRS. MESNER,
HOW YOU FEELING?

23:59.138 --> 24:00.907
- IT--IT--IT WAS MY FAULT.

24:00.940 --> 24:03.042
I REACHED FOR THE KNIFE.
- OKAY.

24:03.075 --> 24:05.712
- I MEAN, WHA--
HOW DID YOU EVEN GET HERE?

24:05.745 --> 24:07.814
- YOUR NEIGHBORS CALLED 911.
- [scoffs]

24:07.847 --> 24:10.917
THIS IS NOT A POLICE MATTER.
I AM FINE.

24:10.950 --> 24:13.886
HENRY WAS VERY, VERY UPSET
THAT HE HURT ME.

24:13.920 --> 24:17.256
- HAS HENRY EVER HURT YOU
LIKE THIS BEFORE?

24:17.289 --> 24:19.826
- NO.

24:19.859 --> 24:21.828
I MEAN, HE'S HIT ME
A COUPLE OF TIMES

24:21.861 --> 24:23.896
WHEN HE'S HAVING A TANTRUM.

24:23.930 --> 24:26.833
BUT I'M ALWAYS ABLE
TO JUST...

24:26.866 --> 24:29.902
CALM HIM DOWN
AND TALK TO HIM.

24:29.936 --> 24:32.772
- AND TONIGHT,
YOU COULDN'T CONTROL HIM.

24:32.805 --> 24:36.543
- HE--HE--
HE DIDN'T MEAN IT.

24:36.576 --> 24:39.111
- HOW DID YOU
GET THE KNIFE, HENRY?

24:39.145 --> 24:42.515
- I KNOW WHERE
YOU KEEP THE KEY, DAD.

24:42.549 --> 24:44.016
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO MAKE HER LAUGH.

24:44.050 --> 24:45.952
BUT SHE DIDN'T DO
WHAT I WANTED HER TO DO.

24:45.985 --> 24:48.621
NOBODY EVER DOES
WHAT I WANT THEM TO DO.

24:48.655 --> 24:50.790
NOBODY EVER LISTENS TO ME.

24:50.823 --> 24:52.925
- YOU KNOW WHAT,
I'M LISTENING, HENRY.

24:52.959 --> 24:54.827
- IT WAS HER FAULT.

24:54.861 --> 24:57.196
- STOP LYING, HENRY!

24:57.229 --> 24:59.031
YOU WERE ANGRY,
AND YOU WANTED TO HURT HER!

24:59.065 --> 25:01.534
- I WASN'T ANGRY.
IT WAS HER FAULT.

25:01.568 --> 25:03.536
- IT ISN'T ALWAYS
SOMEONE ELSE'S FAULT, HENRY!

25:03.570 --> 25:04.804
YOU HAVE TO START
TAKING RESPONSIBILITY!

25:04.837 --> 25:06.706
YOU'RE TEN YEARS OLD,
FOR GOD'S SAKE!

25:06.739 --> 25:09.676
- IT'S HER FAULT! I HATE HER!
I HATE HER SO MUCH!

25:09.709 --> 25:12.144
- HENRY. HENRY.
- I HATE HER!

25:12.178 --> 25:13.145
- HENRY.

25:13.179 --> 25:14.747
BREATHE.
- [struggles]

25:14.781 --> 25:16.749
- IT'S OKAY.
IT'S OKAY.

25:16.783 --> 25:18.250
DA--HENRY.

25:18.284 --> 25:20.286
DADDY IS HERE.

25:20.319 --> 25:23.222
IT'S OKAY.

25:23.255 --> 25:25.858
- WHERE'S MOMMY?

25:25.892 --> 25:29.261
- SHE'LL BE HOME SOON.
EVERYTHING'S GOOD, SWEETHEART.

25:29.295 --> 25:32.164
- MAYBE DADDY CAN
TUCK YOU BACK INTO BED?

25:32.198 --> 25:34.567
WOULD YOU LIKE THAT?
YEAH?

25:34.601 --> 25:37.203
HENRY AND I WILL WAIT HERE?

25:37.236 --> 25:40.973
- I DON'T THINK THAT'S--
- GO AHEAD. WE'LL BE FINE.

25:47.947 --> 25:49.348
- COME ON, SWEETHEART.

25:49.381 --> 25:51.918
- NICE TO MEET YOU, RUBY.
GOOD NIGHT.

25:51.951 --> 25:54.754
- GOOD NIGHT.

25:58.891 --> 26:02.929
- YOU WANNA TALK, HENRY?

26:02.962 --> 26:04.931
- CAN I HOLD YOUR GUN?

26:04.964 --> 26:06.866
- YOU THINK THAT'S
A GOOD IDEA?

26:06.899 --> 26:08.935
- I'VE NEVER
HELD A GUN BEFORE.

26:12.905 --> 26:16.242
YOU'RE REALLY PRETTY.

26:21.981 --> 26:24.617
I'M HAVING STRAWBERRIES.
YOU WANT SOME?

26:24.651 --> 26:26.052
MY MOM WANTS ME
TO EAT FRUIT.

26:33.092 --> 26:35.895
- I THOUGHT
THAT IF I LOVED HIM...

26:35.928 --> 26:38.130
ENOUGH AND HELD HIM AND...

26:38.164 --> 26:40.266
MADE SURE HE SLEPT
AND ATE RIGHT

26:40.299 --> 26:44.637
THAT HE WOULD GET BETTER.

26:44.671 --> 26:46.939
BUT HE'S NOT.
HE'S GETTING WORSE.

26:46.973 --> 26:51.110
HE'S SO BROKEN, AND...

26:51.143 --> 26:53.079
I CAN'T FIX HIM.

26:53.112 --> 26:57.884
I-I TELL HIM I LOVE HIM.

26:57.917 --> 27:01.320
HE'S NEVER SAID
"I LOVE YOU" BACK.

27:03.756 --> 27:07.860
- MRS. MESNER, WE CAN
GET YOU AND YOUR FAMILY HELP.

27:07.894 --> 27:09.428
GET HENRY EVALUATED,

27:09.461 --> 27:12.865
AND GET HIM
TREATMENT OPTIONS.

27:12.899 --> 27:15.067
- 'CAUSE I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO ANYMORE.

27:15.101 --> 27:18.270
MOST DAYS I FEEL--
I FEEL LIKE I'M IN COMBAT.

27:18.304 --> 27:22.041
THESE OUTBURSTS, THIS RAGE.

27:22.074 --> 27:24.076
[sighs] OH, YESTERDAY
HE SAID TO ME,

27:24.110 --> 27:27.413
"MOMMY, YOU HATE ME."

27:27.446 --> 27:30.282
[sighs]
AND YOU KNOW, HE--

27:30.316 --> 27:33.920
HE'S RIGHT.
SOMETIMES I DO. I HATE HIM.

27:33.953 --> 27:37.156
GOD, MY OWN CHILD.

27:37.189 --> 27:38.725
[sighs]

27:40.159 --> 27:42.028
- HEY, HENRY,
I'M DR. HUANG.

27:42.061 --> 27:43.963
[door closes]

27:43.996 --> 27:46.232
- I KNOW.
THEY TOLD ME WHO YOU WERE.

27:46.265 --> 27:48.768
- HOW ARE YOU DOING TODAY?

27:48.801 --> 27:51.103
- FINE. HOW ARE YOU?

27:51.137 --> 27:54.774
- OH, I'M A LITTLE
JET-LAGGED, THANKS.

27:54.807 --> 27:57.944
SO WE'RE JUST GONNA
TALK FOR A LITTLE BIT, OKAY?

27:57.977 --> 28:00.780
- SURE.

28:00.813 --> 28:03.215
- LET'S START
WITH SOMETHING FUN.

28:03.249 --> 28:04.851
WHAT DO YOU LIKE
TO PLAY WITH?

28:04.884 --> 28:07.787
- ACTION FIGURES,
SUPERHEROES.

28:07.820 --> 28:10.923
- OH, YEAH?
WHO'S YOUR FAVORITE ACTION HERO?

28:10.957 --> 28:13.960
- BANE.
HE LIKES TO RIP PEOPLE APART.

28:13.993 --> 28:15.294
AND LASERECTOR.

28:15.327 --> 28:18.330
HE LIKES TO KILL PEOPLE
WITH HIS LASER BEAM EYES.

28:18.364 --> 28:21.133
- WELL, I'M GLAD
YOU LIKE ACTION FIGURES,

28:21.167 --> 28:24.170
BECAUSE WE'VE
GOT SOME RIGHT HERE.

28:24.203 --> 28:26.806
OH, I WANT TO BE CAPE MAN.

28:26.839 --> 28:28.007
WHO DO YOU WANT TO BE?

28:28.040 --> 28:29.976
- I'LL BE THE SPIKY ALIEN.

28:30.009 --> 28:32.879
- OH, GREAT, OKAY,
SO LET'S SAY THAT CAPE MAN

28:32.912 --> 28:35.915
IS DOING SOMETHING
THAT SPIKY ALIEN DOESN'T LIKE.

28:35.948 --> 28:37.449
- LIKE PLAY WITH MY LEGOS?

28:37.483 --> 28:38.918
- RIGHT, LIKE PLAYING
WITH YOUR LEGOS.

28:38.951 --> 28:40.152
SO CAPE MAN IS

28:40.186 --> 28:44.023
PLAYING WITH
SPIKY ALIEN'S LEGOS, AND--

28:47.827 --> 28:49.261
- NOW HE'S DEAD.

28:49.295 --> 28:52.431
HE CAN'T DO ANYTHING
I DON'T LIKE ANYMORE.

28:56.102 --> 28:59.906
- I'M CONFLICTED ABOUT LABELING
A TEN-YEAR-OLD A PSYCHOPATH.

28:59.939 --> 29:01.540
BUT...

29:01.573 --> 29:03.409
- BUT...

29:03.442 --> 29:05.812
- I'VE HAD A CHILL LIKE THAT
TWO TIMES IN MY LIFE...

29:05.845 --> 29:08.447
WITH DEATH ROW
SERIAL KILLERS.

29:08.480 --> 29:10.950
- WELL, HE'S A YOUNG BOY.

29:10.983 --> 29:13.252
- HE'S NOT LIKE
NORMAL YOUNG BOYS.

29:13.285 --> 29:15.922
- I GAVE HIM
THE PSYCHOPATHY TEST.

29:15.955 --> 29:18.324
HE'S TWO STANDARD DEVIATIONS
PAST THE NORMAL RANGE

29:18.357 --> 29:20.860
FOR CALLOUS,
UNEMOTIONAL BEHAVIOR.

29:20.893 --> 29:24.496
- IN LAYMAN'S TERMS, DOC.
- HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY EMOTIONS.

29:24.530 --> 29:26.565
HE DOESN'T RECOGNIZE THEM
IN OTHERS.

29:26.598 --> 29:29.969
HE HAS NO EMPATHY.
WE KNOW THAT HE'S MANIPULATIVE.

29:30.002 --> 29:33.472
YOU USUALLY SEE THIS PATHOLOGY
IN CASES OF ABUSE OR NEGLECT.

29:33.505 --> 29:37.209
- SO PARENTS THAT LOVE HIM
ARE JUST NOT GOING TO BE ENOUGH.

29:37.243 --> 29:39.078
- NO, THEY'RE NOT.

29:39.111 --> 29:41.080
- HE'S JUST WIRED WRONG.

29:41.113 --> 29:42.982
- NOW, THERE'S
A FACILITY IN VERMONT

29:43.015 --> 29:45.417
THAT TREATS KIDS
WITH THESE SEVERE DIAGNOSES.

29:45.451 --> 29:47.419
MY CONFERENCE ENDS TODAY.

29:47.453 --> 29:49.288
I COULD TALK TO THE PARENTS
ABOUT THE PROGRAM

29:49.321 --> 29:50.890
BEFORE I GO BACK
TO OKLAHOMA.

29:50.923 --> 29:54.393
- AND IF THEY'RE
AGAINST IT?

29:54.426 --> 29:58.898
- THEN I'D ADVISE
THAT THEY GET A SAFE ROOM.

29:58.931 --> 30:00.833
- WE DID YOUR INTERVIEWS.

30:00.867 --> 30:02.935
WE PUT HENRY
THROUGH YOUR TESTS.

30:02.969 --> 30:04.403
AND DO YOU KNOW
WHAT THE RESULT IS?

30:04.436 --> 30:07.907
HE'S WORSE!

30:07.940 --> 30:11.143
HE KICKED A HOLE IN HIS
BEDROOM DOOR! I DON'T EVEN--

30:11.177 --> 30:12.578
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HE'LL DO NEXT.

30:12.611 --> 30:15.247
- DON'T BLAME THEM.

30:15.281 --> 30:17.283
- I DON'T WANT HIM
LOCKED UP, LEFT ALONE,

30:17.316 --> 30:19.118
AFRAID WE'VE
ABANDONED HIM, VIOLA.

30:19.151 --> 30:20.953
- HE'S NOT AFRAID
OF US LEAVING HIM, TOM.

30:20.987 --> 30:23.489
HE'S NOT AFRAID
OF ANYTHING.

30:23.522 --> 30:25.324
- YOU'RE AGREEING
WITH THEM, HUH?

30:25.357 --> 30:27.626
WELL, IF THEY'RE RIGHT,
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT WE THINK.

30:27.659 --> 30:30.629
IT'S TOO LATE.
- IT IS LATE.

30:30.662 --> 30:33.532
IT WOULD'VE BEEN BETTER TO CATCH
THIS AT THREE INSTEAD OF TEN,

30:33.565 --> 30:35.234
BUT THERE ARE
NEW APPROACHES.

30:35.267 --> 30:38.570
HENRY'S NEVER GONNA
GROW OUT OF THIS,

30:38.604 --> 30:40.907
AND HE CAN'T BE CURED.

30:40.940 --> 30:42.241
BUT IT IS TO HIS BENEFIT

30:42.274 --> 30:44.210
TO LEARN THAT HE CAN
CONTROL HIS BEHAVIOR.

30:44.243 --> 30:47.579
- YOU MEAN IF HE SLAMS
HIS SISTER'S FINGER IN THE DOOR,

30:47.613 --> 30:50.016
HE WON'T GET TO PLAY
VIDEO GAMES?

30:50.049 --> 30:51.650
WE'VE TRIED THAT, SIR.

30:51.683 --> 30:54.286
- MR. MESNER,
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO SAY

30:54.320 --> 30:56.355
IS THAT HENRY
NEEDS MORE SUPPORT

30:56.388 --> 30:59.658
THAN YOU AND YOUR WIFE
CAN PROVIDE.

30:59.691 --> 31:02.995
- THIS IS OUR MISTAKE, TOM.

31:03.029 --> 31:04.931
WE THOUGHT
WE COULD HANDLE HIM,

31:04.964 --> 31:07.066
BUT WE CAN'T.

31:07.099 --> 31:09.468
WE--WE HAVE
TO GIVE THIS A TRY,

31:09.501 --> 31:11.971
FOR EVERYONE'S SAKE.

31:15.707 --> 31:17.443
- HEY, WE'RE IN LUCK.

31:17.476 --> 31:19.445
VERMONT HAS A SPACE
FOR HENRY.

31:19.478 --> 31:21.480
HE CAN START NEXT WEEK.

31:21.513 --> 31:22.982
- AND THE PARENTS
ARE ON BOARD?

31:23.015 --> 31:24.984
- THEY DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

31:25.017 --> 31:26.618
- YEAH, JUST LIKE ME
GOING BACK TO OKLAHOMA.

31:26.652 --> 31:28.387
- WE'RE JUST GLAD WE GOT YOU
WHILE YOU WERE HERE.

31:28.420 --> 31:30.222
MISS YOU.
OUR DOOR'S ALWAYS OPEN.

31:30.256 --> 31:31.924
- TELL THAT TO THE BUREAU.

31:31.958 --> 31:33.625
- COME ON.
WE'LL WALK YOU OUT.

31:35.394 --> 31:37.997
- HOW'D THAT FATHER AND SON
TIME GO?

31:38.030 --> 31:39.598
- HE'S A GOOD KID.

31:39.631 --> 31:43.269
THING IS, CYNTHIA STILL DOESN'T
WANT HIM TO KNOW

31:43.302 --> 31:45.537
I'M HIS FATHER, BUT...

31:45.571 --> 31:47.373
- YOU GOT TIME FOR THAT.

31:47.406 --> 31:50.176
- DO I?

31:50.209 --> 31:52.945
YOU KNOW,
GIL DOESN'T HAVE A FAMILY.

31:52.979 --> 31:54.546
AND, AS BAD
AS HENRY HAS IT,

31:54.580 --> 31:57.950
HE HAS A HOME,
TWO LOVING PARENTS.

31:57.984 --> 32:01.620
I MISSED NINE YEARS
OF HIS LIFE.

32:01.653 --> 32:02.955
IT GOES BY SO FAST.

32:02.989 --> 32:04.190
HEY, YOU KNOW.

32:04.223 --> 32:05.624
WHEN AM I GONNA TELL HIM?

32:05.657 --> 32:06.692
WHEN HE'S 18?
[cell phone ringing]

32:06.725 --> 32:07.659
- MRS. MESNER.

32:07.693 --> 32:09.695
- HI, IT'S HENRY.

32:09.728 --> 32:12.098
I'M REALLY WORRIED ABOUT RUBY.
THERE'S A LOT OF SMOKE.

32:12.131 --> 32:13.332
- WHERE ARE YOUR PARENTS,
HENRY?

32:13.365 --> 32:15.001
- MY DAD'S AT WORK,

32:15.034 --> 32:17.036
AND I LOCKED MY MOM
IN THE LAUNDRY ROOM.

32:17.069 --> 32:18.470
SHE YELLED AT ME
TO CALL 911,

32:18.504 --> 32:19.638
BUT I WANTED TO TELL YOU.

32:19.671 --> 32:21.640
- WE'RE ON OUR WAY,
ALL RIGHT?

32:21.673 --> 32:24.676
WE GOTTA GO...NOW.

32:26.778 --> 32:30.749
[Ruby coughing]

32:41.060 --> 32:41.260
.

32:41.293 --> 32:42.061
- KID NEARLY SET
THE APARTMENT ON FIRE.

32:42.961 --> 32:43.962
DOORMAN PUT IT OUT
WITH AN EXTINGUISHER.

32:43.996 --> 32:46.432
- BY ACCIDENT OR DELIBERATE?
- VERY DELIBERATE.

32:46.465 --> 32:48.000
HE USED MATCH HEADS.
POINT OF ORIGIN--

32:48.034 --> 32:50.469
WASTE PAPER BASKET
STUFFED WITH PAPER.

32:50.502 --> 32:53.039
WE FOUND THE LITTLE GIRL
TIED TO THE BED.

32:53.072 --> 32:56.175
MOM TRAPPED
IN THE LAUNDRY ROOM.

32:56.208 --> 32:57.209
- THANK YOU.
- SHE OKAY?

32:57.243 --> 32:59.278
- YES, YES.
THANK GOD.

32:59.311 --> 33:02.248
- HAS ANYBODY FOUND HENRY?
- WE'RE STILL LOOKING. HEY.

33:02.281 --> 33:04.383
- DOORMAN SAID HENRY
DIDN'T LEAVE.

33:04.416 --> 33:06.618
WE'RE CHECKING THE ELEVATOR
SECURITY CAMERA.

33:06.652 --> 33:08.120
- SO MAYBE HE WENT OVER
TO A NEIGHBOR'S.

33:08.154 --> 33:09.221
DOES HE HAVE FRIENDS
IN THE BUILDING?

33:09.255 --> 33:10.456
- UM, YEAH, YEAH.

33:10.489 --> 33:12.091
SOMETIMES HE PLAYS
WITH TOBY IN 3B.

33:12.124 --> 33:13.259
OR HE GOES DOWN
TO THE BUILDING PLAYROOM.

33:13.292 --> 33:15.161
- OKAY, WE'LL FIND HIM.

33:15.194 --> 33:16.762
- TELL ME HOW THIS HAPPENED.

33:16.795 --> 33:19.498
- TOM AND I TOLD HIM
ABOUT THE TREATMENT FACILITY,

33:19.531 --> 33:21.300
AND HE JUST--
HE LOST IT,

33:21.333 --> 33:22.801
AND HE STARTED
HAVING A TANTRUM.

33:22.834 --> 33:24.336
- AND THEN YOUR HUSBAND LEFT?

33:24.370 --> 33:26.105
- WELL, HE HAD
A WORK EMERGENCY,

33:26.138 --> 33:27.673
AND--AND HENRY STARTED
TO CALM DOWN.

33:27.706 --> 33:29.641
- JUST LIKE THAT.
- WELL, HE AND I TALKED.

33:29.675 --> 33:31.377
YOU KNOW, HE WAS OKAY,
AND...

33:31.410 --> 33:34.246
I JUST WENT TO PUT
SOME CLOTHES IN THE DRYER,

33:34.280 --> 33:36.715
AND HE MUST HAVE--HE MUST HAVE
WEDGED A CHAIR UNDER THE DOOR.

33:36.748 --> 33:38.284
AND I'M IN THERE
FOR FIVE SECONDS,

33:38.317 --> 33:40.552
AND I START SMELLING SMOKE.
- OKAY.

33:40.586 --> 33:42.521
- AND I WAS JUST
SCREAMING AT HIM TO CALL 911.

33:42.554 --> 33:44.523
- MOMMY...

33:44.556 --> 33:47.059
- IT'S OKAY. I KNOW.
I'M RIGHT HERE.

33:47.093 --> 33:48.394
- YOU STAY WITH RUBY, OKAY?
WE'RE GONNA FIND HENRY.

33:48.427 --> 33:49.661
- PLEASE,
JUST DON'T HURT HIM.

33:49.695 --> 33:51.163
PLEASE,
HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND.

33:51.197 --> 33:52.298
- WE'RE NOT GONNA HURT HIM!

33:52.331 --> 33:54.466
- OPEN UP, MR. BURKE.

33:54.500 --> 33:57.236
- HEY. HI.
WE'RE LOOKING FOR HENRY MESNER.

33:57.269 --> 33:58.337
IS HE HERE?
- YEAH, HE'S HERE.

33:58.370 --> 33:59.405
HE'S IN TOBY'S ROOM.

33:59.438 --> 34:01.307
- ALONE?
- YEAH. LADY, THEY'RE 10.

34:01.340 --> 34:02.708
AS LONG
AS I DON'T HEAR SCREAMS.

34:02.741 --> 34:04.310
YOU WANT TO TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON?

34:04.343 --> 34:05.744
- YOU DIDN'T HEAR THE SIRENS?
- I BUZZED DOWN.

34:05.777 --> 34:07.413
DOORMAN SAID EVERYTHING
WAS UNDER CONTROL.

34:07.446 --> 34:08.547
HENRY SAID HIS PARENTS
GAVE HIM THE OKAY.

34:08.580 --> 34:10.282
THEY'RE PLAYING
ON THE XBOX.

34:10.316 --> 34:12.751
THAT'S WEIRD.
- DID YOU HEAR THEM LEAVE?

34:12.784 --> 34:13.852
- DAD!

34:13.885 --> 34:16.488
- TOBY.

34:16.522 --> 34:19.358
TOBY. JEEZ, ARE YOU--
ARE YOU OKAY?

34:19.391 --> 34:21.393
- [panting]

34:21.427 --> 34:22.394
- TOBY, WHERE'S HENRY?

34:22.428 --> 34:25.131
- HE--HE WAS
HURTING SNOWBALL.

34:25.164 --> 34:26.465
- THAT'S OUR DOG.
HERE, SNOWBALL.

34:26.498 --> 34:28.234
- COME HERE, GIRL.

34:36.142 --> 34:38.110
- DO NOT GO IN THERE.

34:38.144 --> 34:40.712
- HE--HE SAID
HE'D SHOOT ME.

34:40.746 --> 34:42.148
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT, TOBY?

34:42.181 --> 34:43.282
- WITH YOUR GUN.

34:43.315 --> 34:44.550
- DO YOU KEEP FIREARMS
IN THE HOUSE?

34:44.583 --> 34:46.185
- AN ANTIQUE COLT IN MY STUDY.

34:46.218 --> 34:48.254
LOCKED IN A SAFE.
BUT HOW THE HELL--

34:48.287 --> 34:49.421
- [crying]
I KNOW THE COMBINATION.

34:49.455 --> 34:53.259
I'M SORRY, DAD.
- OH, JEEZ, TOBY!

34:53.292 --> 34:54.760
- WHY ARE THE POLICE
HERE AGAIN?

34:54.793 --> 34:56.495
- MA'AM, WE JUST NEED
TO CLEAR THE ROOM.

34:56.528 --> 34:58.230
- MY LITTLE BOY'S STILL
IN THERE--HE'S ONLY FIVE.

34:58.264 --> 34:59.698
- OKAY, WE'RE GONNA
GET HIM OUT.

34:59.731 --> 35:01.333
- THIS IS ABOUT HENRY,
ISN'T IT? I'M GOING IN.

35:01.367 --> 35:02.067
- MA'AM, I NEED YOU
TO STEP BACK.

35:02.100 --> 35:03.435
FIN, HELP ME OUT HERE,
PLEASE.

35:03.469 --> 35:05.271
- SAM, HONEY,
COME TO MOMMY.

35:05.304 --> 35:07.573
- OKAY, LADY, WE'RE GONNA
GET YOUR SON, OKAY?

35:13.445 --> 35:15.447
- HENRY?

35:18.317 --> 35:20.419
HENRY?

35:23.289 --> 35:25.157
HENRY.

35:29.428 --> 35:32.164
HEY, HENRY.

35:32.198 --> 35:34.633
REMEMBER ME?

35:34.666 --> 35:36.302
I WAS AT YOUR HOUSE
THE OTHER DAY.

35:36.335 --> 35:37.903
I'M NICK.

35:37.936 --> 35:40.306
- YEAH, I REMEMBER.

35:40.339 --> 35:42.508
- I WANT YOU TO...

35:42.541 --> 35:44.776
HAND ME THAT GUN, SON.

35:44.810 --> 35:48.347
- DO YOU?
I DON'T WANT TO.

35:57.556 --> 36:01.393
- AND WHO'S
THIS LITTLE GUY HERE?

36:01.427 --> 36:03.562
- SAM.

36:03.595 --> 36:05.864
- HEY, SAM.

36:05.897 --> 36:07.566
HEY, BUDDY.

36:07.599 --> 36:08.934
- HE DOESN'T TALK MUCH.

36:08.967 --> 36:10.702
DEVELOPMENT DELAYS.

36:10.736 --> 36:12.738
- OKAY.

36:12.771 --> 36:14.306
YOU KNOW WHAT, HENRY?

36:14.340 --> 36:16.542
MAYBE IT SHOULD JUST BE
US BIG GUYS HERE.

36:16.575 --> 36:18.310
HUH?
- I LIKE SAM.

36:18.344 --> 36:21.247
- YEAH, BUT HIS MOM...

36:21.280 --> 36:23.715
SHE'S WORRIED.

36:23.749 --> 36:25.651
- CAN I HOLD YOUR GUN?

36:28.920 --> 36:30.922
- MAYBE, UH...

36:30.956 --> 36:32.324
YOU KNOW, WE COULD
TALK ABOUT IT

36:32.358 --> 36:36.828
IF WE LET SAM
GET BACK TO HIS MOM.

36:40.399 --> 36:42.901
- WE'RE COMIN' OUT.
- HE'S COMING OUT.

36:45.304 --> 36:47.373
- YOU STAY.
SHE GOES.

36:49.341 --> 36:50.309
- WE'RE GOOD.
- GO.

36:50.342 --> 36:54.012
- YOU'RE OKAY.
OKAY. OKAY.

36:54.045 --> 36:56.482
- ALL RIGHT.

36:56.515 --> 36:58.417
I'M RIGHT HERE, HENRY.
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

36:58.450 --> 37:00.819
- ARE MY MOM AND DAD
MAD AT ME?

37:00.852 --> 37:04.323
- THEY ARE UPSET.

37:04.356 --> 37:06.692
- I CALLED THE POLICE
WHEN THERE WAS A LOT OF SMOKE.

37:06.725 --> 37:10.262
- THAT'S GOOD THAT YOU DID THAT.
THAT'S--THAT'S REAL GOOD.

37:11.397 --> 37:13.465
- CAN I HOLD YOUR GUN NOW?

37:13.499 --> 37:15.033
- MAYBE LATER.
NOT RIGHT NOW.

37:15.066 --> 37:16.435
- YOU PROMISED!
YOU PROMISED!

37:16.468 --> 37:18.036
- HEY, I SAID
WE'D TALK ABOUT IT.

37:18.069 --> 37:19.938
RIGHT?
- THAT'S WHAT ADULTS ALWAYS SAY

37:19.971 --> 37:21.840
WHEN THEY'RE NOT GONNA LET YOU
DO WHAT YOU WANNA DO.

37:21.873 --> 37:24.810
- NO, HENRY.
- YOU LIED TO ME.

37:24.843 --> 37:28.547
WHAT WOULD YOU DO
IF I SHOT YOU RIGHT NOW?

37:28.580 --> 37:30.749
- ALL RIGHT.
YOU DON'T NEED TO DO THAT.

37:30.782 --> 37:32.351
- WOULD THERE BE A LOT BLOOD?

37:32.384 --> 37:34.553
WOULD YOUR BRAINS COME OUT
OF YOUR FOREHEAD?

37:34.586 --> 37:36.755
- HERE.

37:36.788 --> 37:39.425
I'M GONNA SHOW YOU
MY GUN NOW.

37:39.458 --> 37:41.493
OKAY?

37:41.527 --> 37:43.329
HERE IT IS.

37:43.362 --> 37:45.030
- IS THIS A TRICK?
I DON'T LIKE TRICKS.

37:45.063 --> 37:47.466
- NO, IT'S NOT A TRICK.

37:47.499 --> 37:48.567
ALL RIGHT?

37:50.369 --> 37:52.438
YOU PUT YOUR GUN DOWN,

37:52.471 --> 37:54.373
AND YOU CAN TAKE MINE.

37:56.375 --> 37:58.377
[gunshot]
UHH! UNH!

37:58.410 --> 37:59.645
- UHH!

37:59.678 --> 38:01.813
- NICK?
- I GOT YOU, HENRY.

38:01.847 --> 38:03.081
- NICK!
- I GOT HIM!

38:03.114 --> 38:04.383
WE'RE GOOD!
DON'T SHOOT!

38:04.416 --> 38:06.017
WE'RE GOOD!
- I'LL KILL YOU!

38:06.051 --> 38:08.354
LET GO!
- SHH, SHH, SHH.

38:08.387 --> 38:10.522
SHH. SHH.

38:20.632 --> 38:20.832
.

38:20.866 --> 38:22.000
- I ALWAYS FORGET
HOW MUCH THIS HURTS.

38:22.033 --> 38:23.902
- HE COULD HAVE
KILLED YOU, NICK.

38:23.935 --> 38:25.771
- LOOK, I HAD THE VEST ON.
ALL RIGHT?

38:25.804 --> 38:27.873
I KNEW, WITH THE RECOIL,
HE'D ONLY GET ONE SHOT OFF.

38:27.906 --> 38:29.375
- AND YOU KNEW THAT
HE WOULDN'T HIT YOUR HEAD?

38:29.408 --> 38:30.976
- I'M NOT SHOOTING
A TEN-YEAR-OLD BOY.

38:31.009 --> 38:32.611
- UNCLE NICK.

38:32.644 --> 38:33.879
ARE YOU OKAY?

38:33.912 --> 38:36.014
- HEY. UH, YEAH.

38:36.047 --> 38:37.716
YEAH, I'M--I'M FINE.

38:37.749 --> 38:40.586
CYNTHIA, GIL,
THIS IS MY PARTNER,

38:40.619 --> 38:41.687
DETECTIVE BENSON.

38:41.720 --> 38:42.988
- HEY.
- HI.

38:43.021 --> 38:45.891
- NICE TO MEET YOU.
- NICE TO MEET YOU.

38:45.924 --> 38:47.025
- HI.
- HI.

38:49.027 --> 38:50.496
I'LL GIVE YOU A MINUTE.

38:54.933 --> 38:56.635
- YOU GUYS DIDN'T NEED TO...

38:56.668 --> 38:58.604
I JUST DIDN'T WANT YOU
TO HEAR ABOUT IT ON THE NEWS.

38:58.637 --> 39:01.873
AND THEN...
- IT'S OKAY.

39:01.907 --> 39:03.742
I THOUGHT THERE WAS SOMETHING

39:03.775 --> 39:07.579
THAT YOU AND GIL
NEEDED TO TALK ABOUT,

39:07.613 --> 39:09.748
MAN TO MAN.

39:12.083 --> 39:13.885
- HEY, CYNTHIA...

39:13.919 --> 39:17.856
HOW ABOUT WE GO GRAB
A CUP OF COFFEE?

39:17.889 --> 39:19.491
- SOUNDS GOOD.

39:28.867 --> 39:31.537
- I NEVER LIKED SNOWBALL.

39:31.570 --> 39:35.507
- WHAT DID YOU DO, HENRY?

39:35.541 --> 39:37.809
- I TIED HER LEASH
TO THE FAUCET,

39:37.843 --> 39:41.547
THEN I TURNED ON THE TUB
AND HELD HER DOWN.

39:41.580 --> 39:43.882
- WHERE WAS TOBY?

39:43.915 --> 39:46.017
- HE STARTED CRYING,
AND THEN HE PEED HIS PANTS,

39:46.051 --> 39:47.453
SO I PUT HIM
IN THE CLOSET.

39:47.486 --> 39:49.688
- HMM.

39:49.721 --> 39:52.858
AND SNOWBALL?

39:52.891 --> 39:55.694
- TOOK LONGER
THAN I THOUGHT.

39:58.597 --> 40:00.131
- AND WHAT ABOUT
YOUR SISTER?

40:00.165 --> 40:02.434
WHY DID YOU TIE HER
TO THE BED?

40:02.468 --> 40:04.870
- I WANTED TO SEE IF
SHE'D MELT FROM THE INSIDE OUT.

40:04.903 --> 40:07.906
BUT THEN IT GOT SMOKY,
AND I COULDN'T SEE.

40:07.939 --> 40:10.776
- SO YOU CALLED
DETECTIVE BENSON.

40:10.809 --> 40:12.878
- THIS IS ALL HER FAULT.

40:12.911 --> 40:15.113
SHE'S THE ONE WHO WANTED
TO SEND ME AWAY.

40:15.146 --> 40:18.083
- I CAN'T LISTEN TO ANYMORE.

40:18.116 --> 40:19.718
- WHAT HAPPENS NOW?

40:19.751 --> 40:21.753
- YOUR SON TRIED TO KILL
HIS SISTER.

40:21.787 --> 40:24.490
HE SHOT A COP.

40:26.658 --> 40:28.627
- HE'S NOT GOING HOME.

40:28.660 --> 40:31.563
- HE'S TEN YEARS OLD.

40:31.597 --> 40:33.799
- HE'LL BE CHARGED
WITH JUVENILE DELINQUENCY.

40:33.832 --> 40:35.200
- AND THEN WHAT?

40:35.233 --> 40:37.135
THEN HE--
HE GOES TO JAIL?

40:37.168 --> 40:40.772
- THE JUDGE WILL SENTENCE HIM
TO A JUVENILE FACILITY.

40:40.806 --> 40:43.441
- SO HE'LL--
HE'LL GET HELP?

40:43.475 --> 40:47.746
- IN A SECURE
TREATMENT FACILITY.

40:47.779 --> 40:49.748
- YOU MEAN HE'S GONNA BE
LOCKED AWAY?

40:49.781 --> 40:51.583
- YES.

40:51.617 --> 40:53.785
PROBABLY UNTIL HE'S 18.

40:53.819 --> 40:55.954
- [crying]
HENRY...

41:00.258 --> 41:03.762
LET US BE THE ONES
TO TELL HIM, OKAY?

41:07.966 --> 41:09.768
YOU UNDERSTAND, RIGHT?

41:09.801 --> 41:11.069
IT'S BECAUSE OF
WHAT HAPPENED WITH SNOWBALL

41:11.102 --> 41:12.971
AND RUBY AND...

41:13.004 --> 41:16.107
THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE
GONNA LIVE NOW, OKAY?

41:16.141 --> 41:19.545
BUT YOU CAN'T
LIVE AT HOME ANYMORE.

41:19.578 --> 41:21.847
- BUT I DON'T--
I DON'T WANNA GO THERE.

41:21.880 --> 41:26.017
- WE'RE STILL
GONNA BE A FAMILY.

41:26.051 --> 41:29.955
WE'RE STILL GONNA
SEE EACH OTHER.

41:29.988 --> 41:32.824
- AND YOU SAID YES?

41:35.026 --> 41:38.964
DADDY, DON'T LET THEM
TAKE ME AWAY.

41:47.906 --> 41:51.677
- HENRY...HENRY.

41:51.710 --> 41:53.244
I LOVE YOU.

41:53.278 --> 41:54.880
- [crying]
I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY.

41:54.913 --> 41:56.147
I LOVE YOU.

41:56.181 --> 41:58.684
I LOVE YOU.
I'M SORRY.

42:00.819 --> 42:02.721
I'M SORRY.
I LOVE YOU.

42:02.754 --> 42:03.855
[sniffling]

42:03.889 --> 42:05.791
- I LOVE YOU, TOO, SON.

42:14.099 --> 42:15.834
I LOVE YOU.
