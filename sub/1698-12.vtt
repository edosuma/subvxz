00:05.840 --> 00:09.260
He is gonna have such an awesome time seeing the band again.

00:09.300 --> 00:10.420
And it is so cool that

00:10.420 --> 00:12.300
he trusts us to leave us alone for the first time.

00:13.100 --> 00:14.610
Sucker!

00:17.550 --> 00:19.480
We're gonna party...

00:19.590 --> 00:21.510
...and party hardy...

00:21.560 --> 00:23.440

00:23.470 --> 00:25.490
...you don't know a Marty...

00:25.520 --> 00:27.430
...but it rhymes with party...

00:28.640 --> 00:30.700
...that's kind of smarty!

00:34.110 --> 00:38.330
Now. Young man, I expect you home before curfew.

00:38.390 --> 00:41.340

01:02.100 --> 01:04.690
You get the limo out front.

01:06.060 --> 01:09.610
Hottest styles, every shoe, every color.

01:09.770 --> 01:12.940
Yea when your famous it can be kinda fun.

01:13.470 --> 01:17.510
It's really you but no one ever discovers.

01:18.350 --> 01:21.380
Who would've thought that a girl like me

01:21.740 --> 01:27.100
would double as a superstar?

01:27.990 --> 01:31.680
You get the best of both worlds.

01:31.840 --> 01:33.640
Chill it out, take it slow,

01:33.820 --> 01:35.570
then you rock out the show.

01:35.590 --> 01:39.470
You get the best of both worlds.

01:39.840 --> 01:42.390
Mix it all together and you know that

01:42.510 --> 01:45.200
It's the best of both worlds.

01:45.570 --> 01:48.130
Hannah Montana  S03E12  You Give Lunch a Bad Name

01:49.090 --> 01:53.750
Oh. Well, that's a really nice way to greet your Mamaw!

01:54.310 --> 01:56.320
You just see how you look when you're my age

01:56.630 --> 01:58.300
you've been stuck on a plane between some

01:58.300 --> 02:00.370
smelly old coot that wants to play footsy

02:00.630 --> 02:02.660
and a fidgety four year old who keeps on trying to

02:02.660 --> 02:04.650
put out your hair with his juice box.

02:04.870 --> 02:06.200
Where's my hug!

02:06.630 --> 02:08.130
Mamaw!

02:10.300 --> 02:12.480
You're here because...

02:12.510 --> 02:14.280
Your daddy seems to think that you're

02:14.280 --> 02:15.880
old enough to be left on your own.

02:21.010 --> 02:23.330
I swear you can read his butt like a road map.

02:24.590 --> 02:26.800
And you're here because...

02:26.830 --> 02:29.940
I'm here because I don't care how old you are

02:29.980 --> 02:31.940
you still need some adult supervision.

02:32.120 --> 02:33.790
And I really wanted to see you.

02:34.320 --> 02:37.160
Sorry, Mamaw. We're really happy to see you too. It's just...

02:37.430 --> 02:39.880
we were kind of excited to show Dad how mature we can be.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.230
Yeah you know, do our chores...

02:42.300 --> 02:43.670
stick to our curfews without any

02:43.670 --> 02:45.760
adult's supervision whatsoever.

02:46.270 --> 02:48.370
Oh. Well, I guess in that case then

02:48.370 --> 02:50.630
I might as well just hitch up the wagon

02:50.710 --> 02:54.200
and head on back to the home for gullible old grannies

02:57.150 --> 02:58.150
...not!

02:58.970 --> 03:00.440
Fine I'll go do the dishes.

03:00.970 --> 03:02.680
I'll go flush my toilet.

03:03.080 --> 03:05.660
Oh please you two this is your Mamaw!

03:06.730 --> 03:10.190
I can see you're all dressed up and ready to part-y

03:10.250 --> 03:12.960
so you two go on ahead and have yourself some fun.

03:13.020 --> 03:13.870
Thanks, Mamaw!

03:14.370 --> 03:15.220
See you later.

03:15.650 --> 03:18.390
So what if I was stuck on a cramped plane

03:18.390 --> 03:20.030
full of contagious diseases

03:20.030 --> 03:21.710
just thinking about those grandkids that

03:21.710 --> 03:23.230
I haven't seen in almost a year.

03:24.880 --> 03:25.680
Later!

03:26.450 --> 03:28.240
Then I lost my luggage.

03:28.920 --> 03:30.740
Then my cab broke down

03:30.760 --> 03:33.030
but I knew I would forget all that when I was

03:33.070 --> 03:35.950
in the warm embrace of my loving family. But no.

03:36.260 --> 03:38.770
No wait! They have got friends to go see

03:38.780 --> 03:42.110
who have a whole lot life ahead of them than I have.

03:44.120 --> 03:47.830
Maybe we could stick around and hang out with you.

03:48.330 --> 03:50.080
Please say no! Please say no! Please say no!

03:50.080 --> 03:51.920
Well if that's what you would like.

03:54.120 --> 03:56.190
Why don't you go unpack my suitcase

03:56.230 --> 03:57.420
I wrapped up some homemade

03:57.420 --> 03:59.440
Peanut brittle in my delicates.

04:00.520 --> 04:02.010
Yum.

04:07.180 --> 04:09.130
I can't believe I had to miss Coop's party.

04:09.450 --> 04:12.490
Coop's party! I missed Taylor Swift's party!

04:12.500 --> 04:14.060
On a yacht!

04:14.590 --> 04:17.720
With that handsome tortured guy from that vampire movie.

04:18.990 --> 04:20.880
You want to talk handsome and tortured?

04:21.010 --> 04:23.290
You should've seen me and Mamaw at the beach yesterday.

04:29.340 --> 04:31.980
Hey, Jackson! Check out the lucky lu's!

04:34.000 --> 04:36.830
Don't worry girls I'm not his date!

04:37.080 --> 04:39.280
I'm his Mamaw!

04:40.900 --> 04:42.700
He's cute, huh!

04:46.390 --> 04:48.680
She's usually not this clingy!

04:49.000 --> 04:50.540
It's like she's trying to pack a

04:50.540 --> 04:52.740
year's worth of visits into one week.

04:53.720 --> 04:56.430
Ssssh! Quiet,You'll wake her.

04:56.430 --> 04:59.420
The last thing I need is another clean underwear check.

05:00.630 --> 05:02.480
At least you passed yours!

05:11.290 --> 05:15.070
Whoa! Nothing like a morning jog.

05:15.430 --> 05:17.790
And a little appreciative hubba-hubba

05:17.820 --> 05:20.680
from one Mister William Shatner!

05:22.170 --> 05:24.460
Good for you Mamaw late for school gotta go bye!

05:25.600 --> 05:28.770
Good lord you two would have yowl got in those things?

05:29.030 --> 05:31.180
I haven't seen anybody drag that much weight around

05:31.210 --> 05:33.870
since your daddy's eighth grade chunky phase.

05:34.800 --> 05:37.000
It's no big deal Mamaw they're just books!

05:37.370 --> 05:38.410
No big deal?

05:38.690 --> 05:41.420
Back when I was the lunch lady at East Northumberland High

05:41.450 --> 05:43.550
I stretched munch menues to lug around a pack like that.

05:43.550 --> 05:46.450
By his senior year they were calling him scrunch-munch man.

05:48.720 --> 05:51.420
Oh I could listen to your stories all day.

05:51.430 --> 05:54.470
It's... It's too bad I have to go to school.

05:56.520 --> 05:58.170
Now hold on you two!

05:58.210 --> 06:00.970
If I wanted mules in the family I'd of married a donkey.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.160
And no cracks about your grandpa's heirs!

06:04.030 --> 06:05.800
Mamaw! We gotta go to school.

06:06.030 --> 06:07.440
There's nothing we can do about it now.

06:07.750 --> 06:09.220
You wanna bet?

06:19.160 --> 06:20.440
Hey wassup?

06:23.120 --> 06:25.390
OK guys,you're gonna love this.

06:25.420 --> 06:27.630
We heard a couple of nerds were walking down

06:27.630 --> 06:29.490
the hall with musical...

06:31.360 --> 06:34.950
Oh... Hmm

06:35.360 --> 06:36.640
let me guess.

06:36.750 --> 06:37.830
Mamaw?

06:37.830 --> 06:39.320
They were the last ones in the store.

06:39.550 --> 06:41.000
Hey well you know on the bright side

06:41.060 --> 06:42.860
you don't have to worry about anybody stealing them.

06:43.420 --> 06:45.440
Unless an angry mob of kindergartners skip

06:45.440 --> 06:46.980
by on their way to recess...

06:50.220 --> 06:51.660
Sweet niblets!

06:53.430 --> 06:54.580
Hey it's not our fault!

06:54.700 --> 06:56.450
Our Grandma made us do it!

07:00.390 --> 07:04.100
Well at least we were able to ditch the matching thermoses.

07:04.200 --> 07:06.480
Hey there you are you silly billies

07:06.490 --> 07:09.320
you forgot your matching thermoses!

07:09.410 --> 07:12.310
Just ignore her! Walk away!

07:14.170 --> 07:16.950
Hey Jackson. Heads up!

07:41.390 --> 07:44.270
Now, let's see... who could have caused this?

07:44.270 --> 07:46.810
Eeny, meany, miney...Stewart.

07:47.380 --> 07:48.860
Principal Weebie, this wasn't my fault.

07:48.890 --> 07:51.910
OH, please... that was a perfect spiral!

07:51.920 --> 07:53.560
Wow! And you are?

07:54.140 --> 07:57.100
Ruthie Ray Stewart. I am... I'm their Mamaw.

07:57.420 --> 07:59.520
I am really sorry about all this.

07:59.530 --> 08:02.060
Well, broken legs happen and so that the two

08:02.060 --> 08:04.340
for one early birds special at the beef 'n' waffle.

08:05.030 --> 08:07.290
Well, that is awfully tempting but

08:07.290 --> 08:09.160
don't you think you should be looking for a replacement?

08:09.170 --> 08:10.590
I mean these kids have got to eat.

08:10.770 --> 08:12.280
But where am I gonna find somebody

08:12.320 --> 08:14.570
with years of experience of our beloved Jane?

08:14.710 --> 08:15.990
-Judy!  -Whatever!

08:16.560 --> 08:19.060
If I could just butt in for a second.

08:19.190 --> 08:21.280
Please don't volunteer, please don't volunteer.

08:21.280 --> 08:22.700
I would like to volunteer.

08:23.530 --> 08:24.390
You?

08:24.610 --> 08:26.980
Well, North Central Nashville school

08:26.980 --> 08:28.390
district lunch lady of the year

08:28.420 --> 08:31.100
1982 through 99 at your service.

08:31.580 --> 08:32.809
Shut up!

08:32.909 --> 08:34.520
You shut up.

08:39.150 --> 08:42.850
WOW! I can't imagine anything more embarrassing than that.

08:43.020 --> 08:45.230
Oh really? Wait for it!

08:56.400 --> 08:58.450
Manderson sit up straight!

09:00.270 --> 09:04.900
Gordenski that is a fork not a forklift! Slow down!

09:07.110 --> 09:08.240
Hoods up!

09:08.320 --> 09:09.340
Heads down!

09:11.240 --> 09:12.620
I see you!

09:14.320 --> 09:16.290
-Lilly Truscott?  -Yes?

09:16.310 --> 09:18.490
You have not touched your lima beans.

09:18.770 --> 09:20.900
I'm not a big fan of Lima Beans.

09:21.370 --> 09:23.680
Then don't ask them for their autograph!

09:25.010 --> 09:25.960
Yes ma'am.

09:26.540 --> 09:28.460
Hey hey hey hey where do you think you're going?

09:28.690 --> 09:29.630
I'm finished.

09:29.650 --> 09:32.520
With all of that coleslaw left? I don't think so!

09:32.700 --> 09:34.560
You sit down son that is roughage.

09:34.690 --> 09:36.350
You need every single bit of that

09:36.360 --> 09:38.120
keep everything moving along regular like.

09:38.180 --> 09:38.840
Mamaw!

09:38.840 --> 09:40.080
Don't you Mamaw me.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.240
You know the problem you had this morning!

09:42.410 --> 09:44.680
We do not need a repeat of that tomorrow!

09:47.610 --> 09:49.010
Mmmh this's so good.

09:49.050 --> 09:50.760
Love the lima bean, mamaw.

09:57.220 --> 09:59.480
Yeah, a napkin probably would've been a good idea.

10:02.250 --> 10:04.180
Rico, are you comfortable?

10:04.460 --> 10:06.410
Yeah. Yeah, thanks!

10:06.750 --> 10:08.670
That was sarcasm sweetie.

10:08.770 --> 10:10.390
Get off the table!

10:13.640 --> 10:16.020
That woman is ruining my reputation!

10:16.230 --> 10:18.120
I am never gonna live this down!

10:18.160 --> 10:20.250
Hey, guys, I think people are a little more mature

10:20.250 --> 10:21.430
than you give them credit for.

10:21.430 --> 10:22.630
Yeah you know they're not gonna blame you

10:22.630 --> 10:23.830
for what your Mamaw's doing.

10:23.870 --> 10:24.950
You!!

10:25.290 --> 10:27.580
You brought this plague upon us!

10:30.120 --> 10:33.290
Hey! Come on! She's only here for a couple of days.

10:34.420 --> 10:35.590
Besides he's the one that stepped on

10:35.590 --> 10:36.970
the cafeteria lady just saying!

10:37.730 --> 10:39.540
If we are ever stranded on a desert island

10:39.540 --> 10:42.020
I am so trading you to the natives for coconuts!

10:44.510 --> 10:47.110
Hello! I have an announcement.

10:47.500 --> 10:49.940
Bad news is... our poor Jackie

10:50.010 --> 10:51.210
Judy!

10:51.220 --> 10:53.410
She'll be out for two months. Who cares!

10:53.430 --> 10:54.710
But the good news is

10:54.740 --> 10:57.590
a certain angel in a hairnet has agreed to

10:57.590 --> 11:00.120
take over until she's back!

11:00.490 --> 11:02.690
Don't say it, don't say it, don't say it!

11:02.700 --> 11:05.250
Ruthie Ray Stewart!

11:06.650 --> 11:08.370
It's official the whole holding hands

11:08.370 --> 11:10.250
and chanting thing doesn't work!

11:12.790 --> 11:14.820
Oh kids, ain't this wonderful!

11:16.080 --> 11:18.990
Oh, look, they're so happy. They're speechless!

11:24.080 --> 11:25.630
We gotta get her to change her mind.

11:25.830 --> 11:27.300
And how are you gonna do that?

11:27.550 --> 11:28.810
One of us has to tell her

11:29.080 --> 11:31.730
because that's a mature, responsible and fair thing to do...

11:32.650 --> 11:33.800
Not me, Ha!

11:34.270 --> 11:35.490
You totally cheated!

11:35.490 --> 11:36.980
-You totally cheated.  -You always cheat.

11:36.980 --> 11:38.610
-Why you do that?  -...but it's not me.

11:38.610 --> 11:41.470
-Be fair once!  -...it dosen't matter...

11:41.470 --> 11:43.290
I don't wanna tell mamaw. Who's gonna tell mamaw?

11:57.160 --> 12:02.010
Alright, lets just do this quick and clean... no emotion.

12:02.790 --> 12:05.800
Just like all those girls who broke up with you.

12:10.880 --> 12:11.930
Stop that!

12:18.000 --> 12:20.740
Mamaw. Hey. I'm glad you're home.

12:20.750 --> 12:22.250
Hey, there he is.

12:22.350 --> 12:24.660
The cutest boy at Seaview High

12:24.670 --> 12:26.900
and a big part of my heart.

12:27.510 --> 12:28.510
Not that big.

12:29.650 --> 12:30.700
I mean come on lets face it.

12:30.930 --> 12:32.880
I do have a history of disappointing

12:32.880 --> 12:34.580
the people I love over and over...

12:35.030 --> 12:35.990
and over!

12:36.730 --> 12:38.200
You never know when it's gonna happen again.

12:38.930 --> 12:40.000
Could be today.

12:40.690 --> 12:43.260
But nothin' is gonna ruin this day for me.

12:43.620 --> 12:46.650
Back in the old hairnet again feeding the future of America

12:46.680 --> 12:49.100
and spending more time with my babies babies.

12:49.220 --> 12:50.440
I tell you something...

12:50.440 --> 12:52.370
most teenagers would hate having

12:52.370 --> 12:53.830
their grandma working at their school

12:53.840 --> 12:55.090
but not mine.

12:55.360 --> 12:57.440
I could just squeeze you to death.

12:58.450 --> 12:59.810
Please?

13:04.410 --> 13:07.020
Hey! You know...I've been thinking

13:07.210 --> 13:09.660
I mean sure Mamaw can be a little difficult...

13:09.820 --> 13:11.270
when you love someone you just...

13:11.290 --> 13:12.430
You wimped out didn't you?

13:12.490 --> 13:14.320
She said I was like half her heart.

13:18.060 --> 13:20.750
What? A hot dog on a stick is fine

13:21.020 --> 13:24.150
but when a hot dog is on the floor it's a health violation?

13:25.580 --> 13:27.650
Where do you think I found the stick?

13:31.000 --> 13:32.640
Stupid health inspectors with

13:32.640 --> 13:35.380
their "rules" and "regulations."

13:37.000 --> 13:39.450
If I didn't own this place... I'd quit.

13:41.370 --> 13:42.680
Wait a minute.

13:43.410 --> 13:46.850
Health inspector... quit...

13:48.000 --> 13:50.300
Ahhhh!

13:50.370 --> 13:52.160
Hey no fair. That was my Ahhh.

13:52.800 --> 13:54.590
Ohhhh.

13:58.690 --> 14:01.080
There's ten seconds left on the clock.

14:01.100 --> 14:02.690
Ruthie Ray Stewart has the potato

14:02.690 --> 14:04.060
she dribbles it down court.

14:04.340 --> 14:06.500
She turns left she shoots

14:07.110 --> 14:10.060
Splash! Nothing but pot!

14:10.320 --> 14:14.090
Ra! Ra! The Crowd goes wild!

14:14.120 --> 14:16.690
She's dancing,she's dancing

14:17.170 --> 14:19.020
-Is she alone?  -What do you see?

14:19.400 --> 14:22.120
Oh! Oh I am loving this lipstick.

14:22.120 --> 14:25.200
I put it on an hour ago and it still looks fresh!

14:25.400 --> 14:27.120
Let me see! Oh you're right! Can I borrow that?

14:27.130 --> 14:28.120
Yeah, sure.

14:28.120 --> 14:33.100
Do you see this is why it's Super-Man! Bat-Man.

14:33.110 --> 14:33.650
Wonder-Woman.

14:33.680 --> 14:34.990
Wonder-Wo-Man!

14:36.460 --> 14:38.530
Let it go!

14:39.470 --> 14:41.490
Jackson! The coast is clear!

14:49.470 --> 14:51.370
Once I get done picking apart her kitchen

14:51.380 --> 14:53.780
she'll be out there faster than that coleslaw I had yesterday!

14:58.400 --> 15:00.090
Ar, good-morning Madam.

15:00.130 --> 15:02.770
Wendell Gutman Los-Angeles Health Inspector

15:06.130 --> 15:08.930
Nobody said anything to me about a health inspection.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.390
And nobody said anything to me about you having an attitude.

15:11.680 --> 15:13.480
Something to hide perhaps?

15:13.670 --> 15:15.570
Absolutely not!

15:15.640 --> 15:16.790
The only bug you're going to find

15:16.790 --> 15:18.610
is the one that stuck in your craw.

15:19.060 --> 15:20.430
Hey I think she's buying it!

15:20.490 --> 15:21.230
Of course she is!

15:21.490 --> 15:22.860
Hannah called in a little makeup favor

15:22.860 --> 15:24.430
from the Star-Wars Walkie guy.

15:24.780 --> 15:26.080
Allen Walker?

15:26.640 --> 15:28.180
Nerd alert.

15:29.780 --> 15:31.450
Well let's just see what we find here.

15:35.650 --> 15:36.520
Nothing...

15:36.550 --> 15:37.550
Told you!

15:37.830 --> 15:38.970
I'm just getting started.

15:39.130 --> 15:41.720
Nothing gets by the Gutman finger!

15:41.940 --> 15:44.840
Oh yeah well quit your talking and get your fingers to work.

15:44.860 --> 15:46.850
I got eight hundred kids to cook for!

16:00.590 --> 16:01.920
This isn't working!

16:02.000 --> 16:04.400
Relax! With Mamaw's temper it's not going to

16:04.400 --> 16:05.700
take much more to make her quit.

16:05.730 --> 16:07.200
But what if he can't find anything!

16:07.390 --> 16:08.460
Oh he'll find something.

16:08.620 --> 16:09.940
Cover Oliver's mouth!

16:09.940 --> 16:10.750
Why!

16:14.080 --> 16:16.460
Things are about to get a little hairy for Mamaw!

16:20.300 --> 16:22.220
OK this is crazy they're cleaner

16:22.220 --> 16:23.480
than when I put them on!

16:24.040 --> 16:26.110
I believe we are done here!

16:26.380 --> 16:29.180
Hey Mamaw. Just wanted to stop by before class.

16:29.430 --> 16:32.110
Oohh I didn't know you had a visitor.

16:32.220 --> 16:33.300
He's not a visitor.

16:33.330 --> 16:36.080
He's a health inspector looking for something unhealthy.

16:36.200 --> 16:38.250
Perhaps he should start with that gut of his,

16:38.260 --> 16:40.460
man looks like he ate an Oompa-Loompa.

16:41.270 --> 16:43.900
Oh well I can tell him he won't find anything

16:43.910 --> 16:45.660
wrong in your kitchen.

16:47.630 --> 16:51.920
Especially not in your legendary noodle casserole!

16:52.090 --> 16:56.210
Oh yes. We'll see about that. Yes, we will.

16:58.310 --> 17:01.430
Oh, what do we have here.

17:02.100 --> 17:06.310
Or should I say what do we have hair?

17:07.980 --> 17:09.349
How did that get in there?

17:09.589 --> 17:12.490
Oh I don't know perhaps incompetence

17:12.990 --> 17:15.250
You can not talk to my Mamaw that way!

17:15.410 --> 17:17.680
She quits! Let's go!

17:18.079 --> 17:20.660
Well wait a minute why on Earth would I quit?

17:21.010 --> 17:24.750
Because you are furious! Furious I tell you!

17:25.079 --> 17:26.000
Come on, Mamaw!

17:26.020 --> 17:27.260
Oh for heaven's sakes

17:27.260 --> 17:28.210
it's one little bit of hair now

17:28.220 --> 17:29.730
if you will excuse me Mr. Gutman

17:29.730 --> 17:31.570
I have got fritters in the fryer.

17:31.600 --> 17:33.650
No, it's Inspector Gutman

17:33.660 --> 17:34.460
and I'll have you know

17:34.470 --> 17:36.080
that I have nose for this sort of thing.

17:37.220 --> 17:38.740
And then some!

17:40.440 --> 17:42.130
Insult the way, madam.

17:42.220 --> 17:43.640
But in my experience

17:43.680 --> 17:46.610
where there's one hair there's usually a clump not far behind.

17:48.230 --> 17:49.610
She ain't my grandma

17:51.810 --> 17:53.030
Ha! What a wimp!

17:54.030 --> 17:57.510
Me and my hair are going to go yell at him for you! Bye!

17:58.730 --> 17:59.660
What do we do now?

18:00.630 --> 18:01.850
Are those your new extensions?

18:01.860 --> 18:02.950
Yes don't they look so...

18:03.560 --> 18:04.320
No!

18:04.490 --> 18:06.050
Would you rather spend the next two months

18:06.050 --> 18:06.880
with your back-pack going

18:06.890 --> 18:09.250
round and round round and round!

18:17.190 --> 18:18.360
Forgive me!

18:22.310 --> 18:23.960
Are you still here?

18:23.980 --> 18:25.620
Oh, I am here alright!

18:26.200 --> 18:27.770
And if I find one more violation

18:27.790 --> 18:29.810
you will never be rid of me!

18:30.460 --> 18:32.570
I will haunt you for every hour

18:32.600 --> 18:35.960
of every day for the rest of your miserable life!

18:36.230 --> 18:39.590
Like a ghost! Whoooaaa!

18:39.810 --> 18:42.440
No job is worth this kind of torment!

18:42.530 --> 18:44.200
I say you walk right now!

18:44.210 --> 18:45.850
Right now I tell you! Come on!

18:45.880 --> 18:48.630
Oh fish cats! He isn't finding anything!

18:49.170 --> 18:53.830
Na-ha! I told you I had a nose for this sort of thing.

18:55.990 --> 18:59.220
Yes and it is dripping all over my clean floor!

19:09.180 --> 19:10.800
Jackson!

19:12.260 --> 19:15.190
What is going on?

19:16.210 --> 19:18.490
I think I know exactly what is going on.

19:18.650 --> 19:20.770
You two wanted me to quit so badly

19:21.030 --> 19:24.060
Congratulations. You got your wish!

19:36.140 --> 19:37.310
Mamaw...

19:37.430 --> 19:39.640
I think you two have said quite enough.

19:40.550 --> 19:43.050
I think maybe it's my turn to talk now.

19:43.260 --> 19:44.340
Oh boy.

19:44.820 --> 19:46.150
Come on. Come up here.

19:49.560 --> 19:52.220
Take a look in that mirror. You know what I see?

19:52.630 --> 19:54.250
Two really apologetic grand kids?

19:54.650 --> 19:56.810
Who love you... very much.

19:57.560 --> 20:00.270
I see grandchildren who are obviously

20:00.430 --> 20:01.940
embarrassed by their grandma

20:01.950 --> 20:03.280
but they didn't have the good sense

20:03.280 --> 20:05.560
to come right out and tell her how they really felt.

20:06.400 --> 20:08.420
You know who the biggest offender is?

20:09.620 --> 20:11.650
No I'm talking about the big red-headed

20:11.650 --> 20:13.090
grandchild in the middle.

20:14.330 --> 20:15.120
What?

20:15.170 --> 20:17.750
Oh, come on. You two you know I used to be

20:17.750 --> 20:19.260
a grandchild once myself.

20:20.310 --> 20:22.300
When I was driving back here I was thinking about

20:22.330 --> 20:24.830
how my grandma used to love to embarrass me

20:24.830 --> 20:26.300
at all the school dances.

20:28.040 --> 20:29.520
She chaperoned the dances?

20:29.530 --> 20:31.790
Oh lord I wish. She was the DJ!

20:33.080 --> 20:35.890
You have no idea how humiliating it is

20:35.900 --> 20:38.860
to hear your Mamaw announced to the entire gymnasium.

20:39.020 --> 20:41.550
Babba Joe ask Ruthie Ray to dance!

20:41.610 --> 20:43.940
She's got your pictures placed all over her room

20:43.950 --> 20:45.970
it's the least you can do Babba.

20:47.020 --> 20:49.070
Wait wasn't grandpa's nickname Babba?

20:49.190 --> 20:51.090
Hey, I didn't say it didn't work.

20:52.070 --> 20:52.940
The point is

20:52.950 --> 20:54.470
I think I was just so excited to be

20:54.470 --> 20:55.970
a part of your lives again that I...

20:56.540 --> 20:58.570
I might have overdone it a smidge.

20:58.580 --> 20:59.820
A smidge!

20:59.840 --> 21:01.740
You know what just because I embarrassed you

21:01.790 --> 21:03.600
does not mean you can sarcasm me Gutman!

21:04.660 --> 21:05.540
Yes, ma'am.

21:05.920 --> 21:07.420
And we're really sorry.

21:08.530 --> 21:10.790
We should've told you how we felt from the beginning and...

21:11.140 --> 21:12.250
I really wish there was something we could do

21:12.250 --> 21:13.490
to make it up to you.

21:14.340 --> 21:16.940
Hey maybe the three of us could spend Saturday together?

21:17.000 --> 21:18.070
Oh sweetie.

21:18.490 --> 21:21.420
Actually ... I already have plans.

21:24.050 --> 21:25.770
How you doing up there Weebie?

21:25.780 --> 21:28.130
Top of the world Ruthie! Top of the world!

21:29.120 --> 21:31.010
Haha!

21:33.100 --> 21:36.450
Health Inspector! I'm here to do a follow up.

21:36.810 --> 21:38.390
Nice try, Jackson.

21:38.390 --> 21:40.620
I heard about your little performance at school.

21:41.350 --> 21:43.970
I have no idea what you're talking about!

21:44.910 --> 21:47.900
"I have no idea what you're talking about."

21:48.860 --> 21:51.180
And this is my real nose too!

21:52.020 --> 21:53.050
Please!

21:54.560 --> 21:56.080
Whoa that sucker's really on there!

21:56.080 --> 21:57.740
Get your hands off me!

21:59.150 --> 22:01.470
Well I'll give you points for staying in character.

22:02.080 --> 22:03.870
But let's see how strong this wig is!

22:04.670 --> 22:06.820
Stop it!  Aww aww awww

22:06.830 --> 22:09.000
I will shut you down!

22:09.620 --> 22:11.970
Hey Rico. Make a new friend?

22:17.530 --> 22:20.520
So argh... can I pay the fine by credit card

22:20.520 --> 22:22.320
or would you prefer a cheque?

22:23.305 --> 22:29.407
