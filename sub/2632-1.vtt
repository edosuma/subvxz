01:03.800 --> 01:06.446
<i>Wind's in the east,</i>

01:06.520 --> 01:09.087
<i>mist coming in,</i>

01:09.320 --> 01:12.046
<i>like something is brewing,</i>

01:12.640 --> 01:15.446
<i>about to begin.</i>

01:15.840 --> 01:18.202
<i>Can't put my finger</i>

01:18.240 --> 01:20.568
<i>on what lies in store,</i>

01:21.320 --> 01:23.602
<i>but I feel what's to happen</i>

01:23.680 --> 01:26.645
<i>all happened before.</i>

02:04.240 --> 02:06.727
- Mr. Russell.
- Mrs. Travers.

02:12.880 --> 02:15.401
Like pink clouds on sticks.

02:16.040 --> 02:17.159
Excuse me?

02:17.160 --> 02:21.570
The cherry blossom. I was trying
to think of what it looks like.

02:22.040 --> 02:23.765
The car should be here by now.

02:24.200 --> 02:26.559
May I use the phone?

02:26.560 --> 02:27.879
I canceled it.

02:27.880 --> 02:29.081
You...

02:29.560 --> 02:31.125
What?

02:32.560 --> 02:33.719
Pamela?

02:33.720 --> 02:34.919
"Mrs. Travers."

02:34.920 --> 02:36.281
Mrs. Travers,

02:36.640 --> 02:38.199
why would you cancel the car?

02:38.200 --> 02:40.079
I shan't be going.

02:40.080 --> 02:41.566
We've been through this.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.399
I've changed my mind.

02:43.400 --> 02:45.045
You made an agreement.

02:45.160 --> 02:47.806
You understand?
A verbal agreement.

02:47.920 --> 02:50.519
Why in the world are you speaking
to me as if I were a neonate?

02:50.520 --> 02:51.599
- He's going to...
- What?

02:51.600 --> 02:52.839
What is he going to do? Sue?

02:52.840 --> 02:55.199
He's very welcome to
every penny I don't possess.

02:55.200 --> 02:56.481
Look.

02:57.400 --> 03:01.047
I've represented you
for a long time.

03:01.520 --> 03:03.679
I like to think of you as a friend.

03:03.680 --> 03:05.439
Yes, I like to think it.

03:05.440 --> 03:08.041
Believe me,
I know it's not reciprocated.

03:09.120 --> 03:12.279
I would never suggest anything
that would cause you anguish,

03:12.280 --> 03:13.891
but there's no more money, Pamela.

03:14.440 --> 03:16.239
"Mrs. Travers."

03:16.240 --> 03:17.601
Simply no more.

03:17.920 --> 03:19.719
Sales have dried up,
no more royalties.

03:19.720 --> 03:22.127
You refuse to write
further books, so...

03:23.440 --> 03:26.439
Do you understand? I...

03:26.440 --> 03:28.959
I'm frightened you don't
understand what that means.

03:28.960 --> 03:31.919
I know what he's going to do to her.
She'll be cavorting and twinkling,

03:31.920 --> 03:34.719
and careening towards a happy
ending like a kamikaze!

03:34.720 --> 03:37.439
We've been trying to do
this deal for 20 years.

03:37.440 --> 03:38.919
He's agreed to both
your stipulations.

03:38.920 --> 03:40.439
No animation, script approval.

03:40.440 --> 03:41.719
Use her to pay my bills?

03:41.720 --> 03:45.039
If I believed in a hell, I'd be
sitting in its waiting room.

03:45.040 --> 03:46.159
Script approval!

03:46.160 --> 03:47.399
He's never granted anything
like that before!

03:47.400 --> 03:49.762
I don't know what else to do!

03:56.840 --> 03:58.804
- Where's Polly?
- I fired her.

04:00.800 --> 04:01.919
It's just as well.

04:01.920 --> 04:04.964
It seems I can't afford
her anymore, anyway.

04:09.160 --> 04:11.522
You don't know what
she means to me.

04:12.520 --> 04:13.839
Polly?

04:13.840 --> 04:15.246
Of course not Polly!

04:16.000 --> 04:17.361
Sake!

04:18.240 --> 04:20.567
Los Angeles.

04:23.400 --> 04:25.841
You only have to
go and work there for two weeks.

04:26.920 --> 04:28.201
Collaborate.

04:28.760 --> 04:30.199
You haven't signed
over the rights yet.

04:30.200 --> 04:31.359
Yet?

04:31.360 --> 04:32.999
You must make this work,
Mrs. Travers.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.199
- Oh, I must, must I?
- You need the money!

04:35.200 --> 04:36.679
- I don't want to see you go broke.
- Stop saying money!

04:36.680 --> 04:38.199
It's a filthy, disgusting word!

04:38.200 --> 04:40.279
I'm picking up the phone now,
Mrs. Travers.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.721
I have final say.

04:48.120 --> 04:49.321
You do.

04:50.040 --> 04:52.004
I have final say.

04:52.360 --> 04:54.559
And if I don't like what
they're doing to her...

04:54.560 --> 04:56.842
Then you don't sign the papers.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.601
He can't make the film
unless you grant the rights.

05:01.200 --> 05:03.767
It's an exploratory trip.

05:05.560 --> 05:06.921
What do you say?

05:10.640 --> 05:13.605
I want to keep my house.

05:25.560 --> 05:27.039
Excuse me, ma'am.

05:27.040 --> 05:29.527
Have you seen my daughter?

05:30.760 --> 05:33.804
I was quite sure I left her
around here somewhere.

05:33.880 --> 05:36.199
Her name is Helen.

05:36.200 --> 05:38.368
No, uh... "Shirley."

05:38.720 --> 05:40.126
Uh, no... Um...

05:40.760 --> 05:41.919
Huh.

05:41.920 --> 05:45.442
Good Lord, I've quite forgotten.

05:45.880 --> 05:47.039
Could it be "Prunella"?

05:47.040 --> 05:48.241
No.

05:48.520 --> 05:49.599
"Pamela"?

05:49.600 --> 05:50.881
No, no, no, no.

05:51.280 --> 05:53.439
I'm sure I have a
special name for her.

05:53.440 --> 05:54.719
"Ginty"!

05:54.720 --> 05:56.119
Why, thank you, ma'am!

05:56.120 --> 05:58.599
"Ginty" it is, of course. Yeah.

05:58.600 --> 05:59.801
Now, have you seen her?

05:59.960 --> 06:01.730
It's me.

06:05.960 --> 06:08.447
Gosh, so it is.

06:08.960 --> 06:10.844
Thank goodness for that.

06:11.280 --> 06:14.643
Oh, I was positive I was going
to be beheaded for losing

06:14.720 --> 06:16.039
Her Highness,

06:16.040 --> 06:19.801
The Royal Princess
Ginty McFeatherfluffy!

06:19.920 --> 06:21.959
Don't lose me.

06:21.960 --> 06:23.161
Never.

06:23.560 --> 06:25.000
I promise.

06:25.600 --> 06:27.079
I'll never lose you.

06:27.080 --> 06:28.559
You ready? Are you sure?

06:29.960 --> 06:32.527
All right, the adventure's
about to begin. Come on.

06:34.240 --> 06:35.319
Up!

06:35.320 --> 06:37.010
There we go.

06:45.400 --> 06:46.559
Can I help you?

06:46.560 --> 06:48.239
I'm perfectly capable, thank you.

06:48.240 --> 06:50.839
They've used all the space.
So greedy.

06:50.840 --> 06:52.679
I'll take it, madam.
I can put it up in front.

06:52.680 --> 06:54.679
I don't want it up in front.
I would like it here

06:54.680 --> 06:56.599
in the corresponding holding
area for my assigned seat.

06:56.600 --> 06:58.239
The flight's closing
in just a few moments, madam.

06:58.240 --> 07:00.279
- I'll have to take it.
- Ah, ah, ah!

07:00.280 --> 07:03.359
You can move mine instead.
It's the gray one.

07:03.360 --> 07:04.971
Thank you.

07:07.520 --> 07:09.006
Thank you.

07:11.920 --> 07:13.639
Will the child be a nuisance?

07:13.640 --> 07:15.205
It's an 11-hour flight.

07:17.760 --> 07:19.319
I don't...

07:19.320 --> 07:20.521
Jolly good.

07:28.680 --> 07:30.928
I hope we crash.

07:35.520 --> 07:37.199
Where's the carriage?

07:37.200 --> 07:39.482
Carriage? Who needs a carriage?

07:39.640 --> 07:40.799
But, darling, we have so many...

07:40.800 --> 07:44.083
A leisurely stroll is a gift,
darling! It's a gift!

07:44.960 --> 07:47.199
Now, Biddy, are you staying?

07:47.200 --> 07:48.719
- Mmm-mmm.
- You're coming with us?

07:48.720 --> 07:50.445
- Mmm-hmm.
- Excellent!

07:50.480 --> 07:51.761
All right.

07:52.720 --> 07:55.844
Thank you so much.

07:56.400 --> 07:57.761
For everything.

07:58.400 --> 07:59.719
- Thank you, miss.
- All right.

07:59.720 --> 08:02.924
Hurry up, everyone.
We mustn't be late for the train.

08:04.400 --> 08:06.039
All aboard! Everybody ready?

08:06.040 --> 08:07.605
Yes.

08:08.520 --> 08:10.239
See you soon, Katie Nanna.

08:10.240 --> 08:11.839
Take care, love.

08:11.840 --> 08:14.964
All right. Everybody ready?

08:15.240 --> 08:17.919
Walking bus!

08:17.920 --> 08:19.999
- Left, right, left, right...
- Miss!

08:20.000 --> 08:21.247
- Miss!
- Oh.

08:23.240 --> 08:25.044
Thank you.

08:35.880 --> 08:36.999
Left!

08:37.000 --> 08:38.399
Left, right, left.

08:38.400 --> 08:40.399
And one, two, three.

08:40.400 --> 08:44.519
New town, new job,
new bank, new life!

08:44.520 --> 08:46.927
Come on, my little ducklings!

08:48.280 --> 08:49.641
Right, left!

08:50.200 --> 08:52.279
Come on! Come along! Come along!

08:59.520 --> 09:01.768
Halt!

09:25.000 --> 09:26.531
"Allora."

09:27.080 --> 09:29.279
Ginty. Come on, my love.

10:19.720 --> 10:21.490
Mmm...

10:22.080 --> 10:23.159
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

10:23.160 --> 10:26.091
<i>we are beginning our descent
into Los Angeles.</i>

10:51.800 --> 10:53.411
Oh, he does, does he?

10:54.080 --> 10:55.479
Travers? P.L. Travers?

10:55.480 --> 10:57.399
- "Mrs."
- Okay.

10:57.400 --> 10:59.159
Well, welcome, Mrs. P.L. Travers.

10:59.160 --> 11:00.759
Welcome to the City of Angels.

11:00.760 --> 11:02.479
Let me take those for you.

11:02.480 --> 11:04.079
- I'm perfectly capable...
- Come.

11:04.080 --> 11:05.611
Oh, never mind.

11:11.760 --> 11:14.399
The sun came out
to say hello just to you.

11:14.400 --> 11:16.284
Don't be preposterous.

11:16.680 --> 11:18.439
It smells, like...

11:18.440 --> 11:21.962
- Jasmine.
- Chlorine and sweat. Ugh!

11:22.280 --> 11:23.766
It's dreadful.

11:24.840 --> 11:26.201
Ugh!

11:47.600 --> 11:49.279
Absurd.

11:49.280 --> 11:51.599
Are you all right back there,
Mrs. P.L. Travers?

11:51.600 --> 11:53.079
It's not "Mrs. P.L."

11:53.080 --> 11:54.879
It's just "Mrs."

11:56.560 --> 11:57.921
It's so hot.

11:58.200 --> 12:00.129
Oh. No problemo!

12:00.320 --> 12:01.479
No problemo.

12:01.480 --> 12:04.160
We got a brand new
air conditioning system, Mrs.

12:04.280 --> 12:05.799
Yeah.

12:05.800 --> 12:07.159
Just about make you feel like

12:07.160 --> 12:09.919
you're in good old
Eng-er-land again!

12:09.920 --> 12:12.559
I tell you, the things they
can put in cars these days.

12:12.560 --> 12:14.000
Gosh almight...

12:15.800 --> 12:17.525
No problemo.

12:33.160 --> 12:36.330
And here we are, ma'am.

12:39.840 --> 12:40.919
Thank you.

12:40.920 --> 12:42.201
Ma'am?

12:43.120 --> 12:45.004
Would you like me
to unpack for you, ma'am?

12:45.680 --> 12:48.279
Young man, if it is your ambition
to handle ladies' garments,

12:48.280 --> 12:51.131
may I suggest you take
employment in a launderette.

12:53.600 --> 12:54.801
Odd.

12:55.840 --> 12:57.883
Odd, Odd.

13:03.160 --> 13:05.203
Oh, dear.

13:05.520 --> 13:07.722
For heaven's sake.

13:07.800 --> 13:10.241
What on earth is...

13:11.800 --> 13:13.001
How...

13:13.320 --> 13:14.885
What on...

13:21.040 --> 13:24.159
No, no, no. This will never do.

13:24.160 --> 13:26.559
Absolutely no pears.

13:26.560 --> 13:28.046
No pears.

13:41.480 --> 13:43.569
A palace.

13:44.240 --> 13:45.965
Complete with mighty steed.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.964
And chickens.

13:48.720 --> 13:49.919
Oh, my.

13:49.920 --> 13:52.159
Oh, we'll make beautiful
memories here, my angel.

13:52.160 --> 13:53.521
Come on.

13:53.920 --> 13:54.959
- All right?
- Mmm.

13:54.960 --> 13:56.889
Girls. Come on.

13:58.560 --> 14:03.402
In this house,
you get to share a room!

14:27.840 --> 14:30.441
Good riddance.

14:31.120 --> 14:32.651
Now...

14:37.480 --> 14:39.330
I'll take care of this.

14:40.000 --> 14:43.124
How old do they think I am?

14:43.640 --> 14:45.808
Five years old, or something.

14:47.440 --> 14:50.079
Poor A.A. Milne.

14:50.080 --> 14:51.566
Ghastly business.

14:51.800 --> 14:53.570
Duck, dog, out.

15:05.120 --> 15:06.560
Much better.

15:18.000 --> 15:22.000
And you can stay there until
you learn the art of subtlety.

15:40.520 --> 15:41.559
Oh!

15:41.560 --> 15:43.444
<i>Lassie!</i>

15:46.400 --> 15:47.519
Ah!

15:49.400 --> 15:50.599
There you are.

15:51.720 --> 15:52.839
<i>Don't worry.</i>

15:52.840 --> 15:55.199
<i>There's nothing wrong
with your television set.</i>

15:55.200 --> 15:56.719
<i>This is a pixie bell.</i>

15:56.720 --> 15:59.764
<i>The sound is much too high
for human ears.</i>

16:00.240 --> 16:01.319
<i>Oh!</i>

16:01.320 --> 16:03.284
<i>There you are, Tink.</i>

16:04.040 --> 16:05.241
<i>Hey!</i>

16:05.600 --> 16:09.486
<i>Hey! Get that stuff off of me!</i>

16:10.280 --> 16:13.599
<i>You know, if you're familiar
with our story of Peter Pan,</i>

16:13.600 --> 16:15.839
<i>you know a little sprinkling
of Tinker Bell's fairy dust</i>

16:15.840 --> 16:18.327
<i>can make you fly. Huh.</i>

16:18.560 --> 16:19.679
<i>Where are you going, Tink?</i>

16:19.680 --> 16:20.919
<i>Haven't you forgotten something?</i>

16:20.920 --> 16:22.167
Off!

16:22.600 --> 16:24.768
That's how we deal with you.

16:40.880 --> 16:42.159
Good morning, Mrs.

16:42.160 --> 16:43.679
It's not "Mrs." It's...

16:43.680 --> 16:45.166
Never mind.

16:45.640 --> 16:47.808
We're just not going
to get it right, are we?

16:47.880 --> 16:49.650
What's that?

16:49.840 --> 16:52.279
Will it be the same
driver every day?

16:52.280 --> 16:55.563
Yes, ma'am. I am all yours.

16:57.280 --> 16:59.130
Hey, sun came out again.

16:59.640 --> 17:01.199
You say it as if you're surprised.

17:01.200 --> 17:03.719
As if the sun were particular
about for whom it appears.

17:03.720 --> 17:05.598
It seems that you think
that I am responsible

17:05.599 --> 17:06.959
for its miraculous
dawning every day.

17:06.960 --> 17:08.763
For heaven's sake, it's California.

17:09.440 --> 17:11.324
Certainly is.

17:18.040 --> 17:20.878
I'd so much rather be
accountable for the rain.

17:20.880 --> 17:22.205
Oh, that's sad.

17:22.599 --> 17:24.799
Sad is entirely the wrong emotion.

17:24.800 --> 17:26.279
I shan't bother explaining why.

17:26.280 --> 17:27.839
It would just... Zip!

17:27.839 --> 17:30.008
Huh. Okey-dokey.

17:32.400 --> 17:35.171
The rain brings life.

17:37.560 --> 17:39.171
So does the sun.

17:39.960 --> 17:40.999
Be quiet.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.690
Yes, ma'am.

18:04.800 --> 18:06.047
I'll get that, sir.

18:06.520 --> 18:08.324
- Got it?
- Yes, sir.

18:11.840 --> 18:13.565
Good morning, Pamela.

18:14.520 --> 18:17.279
It is so discomfiting to
hear a perfect stranger

18:17.280 --> 18:18.999
use my first name.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.679
"Mrs. Travers," please.

18:20.680 --> 18:23.359
I do apologize, Mrs. Travers.

18:23.360 --> 18:26.359
I'm Don DaGradi, the scriptwriter.

18:26.360 --> 18:27.519
Co-scriptwriter.

18:27.520 --> 18:30.279
I shall certainly be having
my say, Mr. DiGradi.

18:30.280 --> 18:32.084
"DaGradi."

18:32.200 --> 18:34.359
Uh... Wonderful,
I welcome your input.

18:34.360 --> 18:36.403
If, indeed,
we ever sign off on a script.

18:37.440 --> 18:39.244
Right. Um...

18:39.880 --> 18:41.679
This is the rest of your team.

18:41.680 --> 18:43.799
This is Dick and Bob Sherman,
music and lyrics.

18:43.800 --> 18:45.839
Boys, the one and only
Mrs. P.L. Travers.

18:45.840 --> 18:48.202
The creator of our beloved Mary.

18:48.320 --> 18:49.559
- Poppins.
- Who else?

18:49.560 --> 18:52.240
"Mary Poppins."
Never, ever just "Mary."

18:53.160 --> 18:54.719
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- Hello.

18:54.720 --> 18:56.519
I fear we shan't be
acquainted for very long.

18:56.520 --> 18:57.559
Why is that?

18:57.560 --> 19:02.559
Because these books simply do not lend
themselves to chirping and prancing.

19:02.560 --> 19:04.839
No, it's certainly not a musical.

19:04.840 --> 19:06.359
Now, where is Mr. Disney?

19:06.360 --> 19:08.719
I should so much like to get
this started and finished

19:08.720 --> 19:10.239
as briskly as is humanly possible.

19:10.240 --> 19:11.799
Perhaps someone could point me
in his direction.

19:11.800 --> 19:13.079
I'd be so grateful. Thank you.

19:13.080 --> 19:16.079
We were hoping to give you
a little tour of the studio.

19:16.080 --> 19:17.199
No, thank you.

19:17.200 --> 19:19.528
Walt just wanted to
show the place off.

19:19.640 --> 19:21.968
No one likes a show-off.

19:22.360 --> 19:25.039
Mrs. Travers,
it's quite a long way.

19:25.040 --> 19:26.810
Not a musical?

19:31.160 --> 19:34.967
I am perfectly capable of walking.

19:45.280 --> 19:46.561
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Dolly.

19:46.680 --> 19:48.680
Could you let Mr. Disney know
I've arrived, please?

19:48.720 --> 19:50.490
Absolutely. Please, have a seat.

19:50.560 --> 19:52.171
Oh, no, there's no need.

19:52.760 --> 19:55.725
He'll be just a moment,
Mrs. Travers.

19:55.920 --> 19:57.645
Why don't we sit?

20:05.040 --> 20:06.651
She's here.

20:06.960 --> 20:08.119
Uh...

20:08.120 --> 20:10.639
A word of advice,
Mrs. Travers, if I may.

20:10.640 --> 20:14.282
You may. Whether I heed it or not
will be another matter entirely.

20:15.120 --> 20:16.279
Wow.

20:16.280 --> 20:17.959
Uh, it's just that

20:17.960 --> 20:20.959
he can't stand being
called "Mr. Disney."

20:20.960 --> 20:23.799
We're all on a first-name basis here.

20:30.280 --> 20:34.007
Well, here you are at last.

20:34.400 --> 20:35.965
Oh, my dear gal,

20:36.080 --> 20:40.439
you can't imagine how excited
I am to finally meet you.

20:41.840 --> 20:43.319
It's an honor, Mr. Disney.

20:43.320 --> 20:44.919
Oh, "Walt." Now,
you gotta call me Walt.

20:44.920 --> 20:46.959
Mr. Disney was my old man,
isn't that right, Don?

20:46.960 --> 20:48.119
Absolutely, Walt.

20:48.120 --> 20:49.599
Come here. Come here.

20:49.600 --> 20:50.961
Tommie.

20:51.120 --> 20:55.639
Say hello to the one and
only Pamela Travers.

20:55.640 --> 20:58.002
It's so nice to meet you.

20:58.520 --> 21:00.321
You know, I can't believe it.

21:00.520 --> 21:02.799
P.L. Travers,
right here in my office.

21:02.800 --> 21:05.401
After all these years,
almost 20 of them?

21:05.480 --> 21:06.839
Mmm. Yes.

21:06.840 --> 21:08.769
Twenty long years.

21:09.200 --> 21:11.359
I wish you could have
seen me then, Pam.

21:11.360 --> 21:13.319
Lean as a whippet, I was.

21:13.320 --> 21:14.839
A racehorse.

21:14.840 --> 21:16.359
Well, anyway.

21:16.360 --> 21:18.879
Now, here you are, and look at you.

21:18.880 --> 21:20.320
I could just eat you up.

21:21.120 --> 21:23.322
Uh... That wouldn't be appropriate.

21:24.600 --> 21:26.879
You know what... When Diane, here,

21:26.880 --> 21:28.519
was about, uh, seven years old...

21:28.520 --> 21:30.839
Oh, can I get you something
to drink? A coffee, or...

21:30.840 --> 21:32.959
A pot of tea would be most welcome.

21:32.960 --> 21:34.839
Anyway, she was about
seven years old

21:34.840 --> 21:36.479
when I was walking past her room

21:36.480 --> 21:38.999
and she was on her bed reading
to her sister, Sharon,

21:39.000 --> 21:42.039
and those girls, they were just
giggling their little socks off.

21:42.040 --> 21:43.319
- Tommie?
- Yes?

21:43.320 --> 21:44.599
A hot tea for Pamela and me.

21:44.600 --> 21:45.959
Right away, Walt.

21:45.960 --> 21:47.571
Ah, you're a doll.

21:47.720 --> 21:49.399
She is. She's a doll.

21:49.400 --> 21:55.004
Anyways, I asked them, I said,
"Girls, what's so funny?"

21:55.240 --> 21:56.879
And Diane said to me,

21:56.880 --> 22:00.289
"Why, Daddy, Mary Poppins."

22:01.560 --> 22:04.570
I didn't even know
what a Mary Poppins was.

22:04.920 --> 22:06.879
But then she gave me
one of your books,

22:06.880 --> 22:09.399
and, oh, by gosh, my imagination
caught on fire.

22:09.400 --> 22:11.199
Absolutely on fire.

22:11.200 --> 22:13.559
And those embers have burned
ever since, as you know.

22:13.560 --> 22:14.999
I do. Yes.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.159
Twenty years.

22:16.160 --> 22:17.719
So you keep saying.

22:17.720 --> 22:19.046
Pam,

22:19.080 --> 22:23.199
a man cannot break a promise
he's made to his kids.

22:23.200 --> 22:27.121
No matter how long it takes
for him to make it come true.

22:27.440 --> 22:29.679
Now, you've kept me
dangling all this time.

22:29.680 --> 22:31.484
But now, I gotcha.

22:31.920 --> 22:33.679
"Gotcha," indeed.

22:33.680 --> 22:36.599
Mr. Disney, if you have "dangled,"

22:36.600 --> 22:39.279
it is at the end of a rope you
have fashioned for yourself.

22:39.280 --> 22:42.239
I was perfectly clear
when you approached me 20 years ago

22:42.240 --> 22:44.599
that she wasn't for sale.
And I was clear again

22:44.600 --> 22:45.679
when you approached me
the following year

22:45.680 --> 22:48.119
and clear again when you
approached me every annum

22:48.120 --> 22:49.799
for the subsequent 18 years,

22:49.800 --> 22:52.279
and quite honestly,
I feel corralled.

22:52.280 --> 22:55.119
Oh, now, Pam, the last thing I want
to do is make you feel as though...

22:55.120 --> 22:57.279
Would you mind? My name
is "Mrs. Travers." I do...

22:57.280 --> 22:59.799
See, I promised them, Pam.
Now, that's a fact.

22:59.800 --> 23:00.959
You got kids?

23:00.960 --> 23:02.439
No. Well, not precisely.

23:02.440 --> 23:04.439
I have never, and absolutely never,

23:04.440 --> 23:06.959
gone back on a promise I made
to either one of my daughters.

23:06.960 --> 23:09.639
Now, that's what being "Daddy"
is all about, right?

23:09.640 --> 23:10.679
Is it?

23:10.680 --> 23:14.319
See, our motion picture is not
just gonna make my kids happy.

23:14.320 --> 23:16.959
It's gonna make
all kids happy. Adults, too.

23:16.960 --> 23:19.119
Because my guys are
gonna do things with it

23:19.120 --> 23:21.799
that are revolutionary, Pam.
Revolutionary!

23:21.800 --> 23:24.639
Your Mary Poppins is gonna
literally fly off the pages

23:24.640 --> 23:26.079
of your books.

23:26.080 --> 23:27.239
Oh. Thank you, Tommie.

23:27.240 --> 23:29.999
This magical woman who has
only lived inside your head,

23:30.000 --> 23:32.239
well, you are gonna be able
to meet her, speak to her.

23:32.240 --> 23:33.487
You're gonna hear her sing.

23:33.800 --> 23:36.119
Now, the singing, I'm very
glad you've come to that.

23:36.120 --> 23:38.322
Oh!
Milk in first, please.

23:38.600 --> 23:40.165
Then the tea.

23:40.480 --> 23:42.364
And a spoonful of sugar.

23:43.480 --> 23:46.729
You don't intend for this
film to be a musical?

23:47.440 --> 23:49.005
I absolutely do.

23:49.040 --> 23:50.119
No.

23:50.120 --> 23:51.845
- No?
- No.

23:52.800 --> 23:57.164
Mr. Disney,
Mary Poppins does not sing.

23:57.960 --> 23:59.319
Yes, she does.

23:59.320 --> 24:01.119
- When?
- In your books.

24:01.120 --> 24:03.527
No, those aren't songs.
They're recitations.

24:03.840 --> 24:07.119
She's not a giddy woman.
She's doesn't jig about.

24:07.120 --> 24:08.199
I mean, singing is frivolous.

24:08.200 --> 24:11.839
It's wholly unnecessary in a
governess, an educatress.

24:11.840 --> 24:13.879
No, it would simply ruin it.

24:13.880 --> 24:16.731
I won't have her turned into
one of your silly cartoons.

24:26.800 --> 24:27.879
Now, Pam...

24:33.640 --> 24:35.251
I want you to know

24:35.880 --> 24:37.879
that the last thing I would do,

24:37.880 --> 24:39.399
the very last thing,

24:39.400 --> 24:42.199
is tarnish a story
I have cherished.

24:42.200 --> 24:46.679
Now, the pages of your books
are worn to tissue.

24:46.680 --> 24:48.399
They are dog-eared and falling out,

24:48.400 --> 24:51.679
because I have pored over them,
gripped and tormented.

24:51.680 --> 24:53.962
Because I love her, Pam.

24:54.160 --> 24:56.601
I love Mary Poppins.

24:56.920 --> 25:01.444
And you, you have got
to share her with me.

25:04.960 --> 25:07.970
And nothing happens
without your say-so.

25:08.080 --> 25:09.199
Quite right.

25:09.200 --> 25:11.439
It's all right here in
the rights agreement

25:11.440 --> 25:13.879
that was approved by your agent.

25:13.880 --> 25:15.079
Uh... Dermot?

25:15.080 --> 25:16.281
"Diarmuid."

25:17.440 --> 25:19.759
A live-action film. No animation.

25:19.760 --> 25:21.644
Live-action. Here's a pen.

25:23.720 --> 25:25.331
I'd like this on tape.

25:25.760 --> 25:27.039
On tape?

25:27.040 --> 25:28.119
Mmm. Your promise,

25:28.120 --> 25:30.641
and all the conversations
we have here, on tape.

25:35.120 --> 25:36.481
Uh-huh. There you are.

25:38.520 --> 25:42.799
Mary Poppins and the Banks,
they are family to me.

25:42.800 --> 25:45.759
I understand that. I do.

25:45.760 --> 25:49.487
Well, then. Shall we begin?

25:51.240 --> 25:53.169
Let's make something wonderful.

25:53.440 --> 25:56.246
Well, let's see if
that's at all possible.

26:03.960 --> 26:05.286
Whoa.

26:05.560 --> 26:06.841
Damn.

26:17.280 --> 26:20.370
Testing. One, two, three.

26:22.840 --> 26:25.202
<i>Testing. One, two.</i>

26:26.480 --> 26:30.319
What is all this jollification?

26:30.320 --> 26:31.839
We've got a whole
script to get through.

26:31.840 --> 26:33.371
It's gonna be a long day, Mrs. T.

26:34.440 --> 26:36.759
Mrs. Travers.

26:36.760 --> 26:38.359
You could save a starving country

26:38.360 --> 26:39.959
with benefaction from
this room alone.

26:39.960 --> 26:42.199
It's just, ugh, so vulgar.

26:42.200 --> 26:44.199
Did you turn on the thing?

26:44.200 --> 26:45.401
Uh...

26:46.640 --> 26:49.525
Yes. Now, let us begin.

26:50.280 --> 26:51.481
Mmm. So...

26:52.040 --> 26:53.359
"Scene 1."

26:53.360 --> 26:55.079
"Exterior, Cherry Tree Lane..."

26:55.080 --> 26:57.248
"Ext"? What's "Ext"?

26:58.720 --> 26:59.921
"Exterior."

27:00.280 --> 27:03.563
It means
the scene takes place outside.

27:03.720 --> 27:05.799
Oh, I see. It is an abbreviation.

27:05.800 --> 27:07.279
I'm so sorry, Mr. DaGradi,

27:07.280 --> 27:09.050
do you feel that you should be...

27:09.200 --> 27:10.999
Oh. Please, be my guest,
Mrs. Travers.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.039
I do think it's best.
I have the most practice.

27:13.040 --> 27:14.959
Readings of my books, you know?

27:14.960 --> 27:16.039
Absolutely.

27:16.040 --> 27:18.599
Anyway. "Scene 1. Exterior.

27:18.600 --> 27:23.199
"17 Cherry Tree Lane, London. Day."

27:23.200 --> 27:24.719
Yes, that's good. That can stay.

27:24.720 --> 27:25.879
That's just the scene heading.

27:25.880 --> 27:28.519
Although, I do think we should say
"Number 17," instead of just "17."

27:28.520 --> 27:29.679
It's proper, yes?

27:29.680 --> 27:31.039
No one's gonna see it.

27:31.040 --> 27:32.730
I will see it.

27:33.360 --> 27:35.519
Write it down.
Write it down. Chop, chop.

27:35.520 --> 27:37.919
Is that on the tape?
Have we got that?

27:37.920 --> 27:39.399
Uh... Yes.

27:39.400 --> 27:41.399
Very good. Onwards.

27:41.400 --> 27:43.967
I'm sorry to interrupt.

27:44.480 --> 27:46.319
- Is that a joke?
- Excuse me?

27:46.320 --> 27:48.568
Do you think you are a comedienne?

27:48.600 --> 27:50.079
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

27:50.080 --> 27:51.719
Well, it's...

27:51.720 --> 27:52.999
- Unbelievable.
- In the way.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.999
Dolly, I think we're
all set with food.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.406
Thank you.

27:57.600 --> 27:59.559
"Scene 1. Exterior.

27:59.560 --> 28:04.199
"Number 17, Cherry Tree
Lane, London. Day."

28:04.200 --> 28:05.919
"Bert, a one-man..."

28:05.920 --> 28:07.679
Oh, the rumor is
that this is to be your Mr. Van Dyke.

28:07.680 --> 28:09.439
- Is that right?
- We do hope so.

28:09.440 --> 28:11.319
Well, we'll see about that.
It's a horrid idea.

28:11.320 --> 28:12.806
Dick is one of the greats.

28:14.280 --> 28:15.481
Dick Van Dyke?

28:16.080 --> 28:17.239
Yes.

28:18.720 --> 28:20.684
Robert, my dear.

28:21.560 --> 28:23.559
Olivier is one of the greats.

28:23.560 --> 28:27.439
Burton, Guinness,
greats without question.

28:27.440 --> 28:32.009
I can assure... I can assure you
that Dick Van Dyke is not.

28:32.640 --> 28:34.126
Dick Van Dyke.

28:34.560 --> 28:37.079
Uh... "Bert, a one-man band,
plays to a small gathering

28:37.080 --> 28:38.959
"outside the gates to the park.

28:38.960 --> 28:40.719
"Bert... Yes, Bert says..."

28:40.720 --> 28:41.967
You can do Bert.

28:42.120 --> 28:44.448
- Thank you. Um...
- Go on.

28:44.880 --> 28:46.081
Guys, shall we

28:47.480 --> 28:49.091
give it a whirl?

28:49.480 --> 28:50.920
What's happening?

28:51.400 --> 28:52.681
What are you doing?

28:56.480 --> 28:58.319
"All right, ladies and gents,

28:58.320 --> 28:59.599
"comical poem

28:59.600 --> 29:01.119
"suitable for the occasion.

29:01.120 --> 29:05.439

before your very eyes.

29:05.440 --> 29:08.279
"All right, here we go."

29:08.280 --> 29:11.848
<i>Room here for everyone
Gather around</i>

29:12.240 --> 29:14.079
<i>The Constable's responstable</i>

29:14.080 --> 29:15.679
<i>Now, how does that sound?</i>

29:15.680 --> 29:17.962
No, no, no! No, no, no!

29:18.640 --> 29:20.205
"Responstable"

29:20.520 --> 29:21.846
is not a word.

29:23.000 --> 29:24.361
We made it up.

29:24.600 --> 29:27.406
Well, un-make it up.

29:44.520 --> 29:46.722
"Responstable."

30:11.560 --> 30:13.728
There's my girl.

30:17.480 --> 30:18.918
Here's a good boy. Come on.

30:18.919 --> 30:20.919
That's it, Albert,
give Ginty a smooch.

30:20.920 --> 30:22.919
There you go. There you go.

30:26.240 --> 30:27.441
Oh.

30:30.240 --> 30:32.283
Poor old Albert.

30:32.600 --> 30:34.679
He's your secret uncle, you know.

30:34.680 --> 30:38.123
But a miserable, horrid witch
turned him into a nag.

30:38.760 --> 30:40.450
Why did she do that?

30:40.680 --> 30:43.121
She said she hated
the sound of his laugh.

30:44.360 --> 30:46.039
Poor Uncle Albert.

30:46.040 --> 30:47.239
Yeah.

30:47.240 --> 30:48.805
How can we fix him?

30:49.280 --> 30:52.131
We have to teach the witch
to be happy again.

30:52.920 --> 30:54.439
How?

30:54.440 --> 30:55.801
Well,

30:56.440 --> 30:58.563
I'm not quite sure, darling.

31:04.080 --> 31:06.160
Do you want to know
what it feels like to fly, Ginty?

31:07.560 --> 31:10.799
Come on. Albert, you old nag.

31:10.800 --> 31:12.081
Come here.

31:14.600 --> 31:16.086
Up you come.

31:19.120 --> 31:20.481
Three, two, one.

31:24.040 --> 31:26.163
- Do you trust me?
- Yes.

31:46.920 --> 31:48.645
Nobody walks.

31:50.920 --> 31:53.361
A leisurely stroll is a gift.

32:14.360 --> 32:16.050
Beautiful, ain't it?

32:17.000 --> 32:19.328
If you like that sort of thing.

32:19.600 --> 32:21.245
I do.

32:43.360 --> 32:45.679
We do find it's helpful
to have a visual.

32:45.680 --> 32:48.360
Plus, it's fun.

32:51.240 --> 32:53.279
Oh, no, no.
No, no. Goodness me, no.

32:53.280 --> 32:54.481
No?

32:55.080 --> 32:57.601
The Banks' house
doesn't look like that. No, no.

32:58.080 --> 32:59.239
Mmm-mmm.

32:59.240 --> 33:01.920
My house is a terraced house

33:02.080 --> 33:04.039
with a pink door, white-bricked,

33:04.040 --> 33:05.279
with a crack in the gable.

33:05.280 --> 33:08.165
Okay, we get it. The house
is not what you pictured.

33:09.120 --> 33:11.079
The windows are lead-lined

33:11.080 --> 33:12.679
and the flower boxes grow

33:12.680 --> 33:14.559
pink nasturtiums to
go with the pink door.

33:14.560 --> 33:16.079
Have we got that?

33:16.080 --> 33:18.726
Oh, dear, it's all a big mistake.
It's all wrong.

33:18.760 --> 33:20.119
It's all wrong?

33:20.120 --> 33:21.759
Well, it's too grand!

33:21.760 --> 33:25.359
The Banks are normal, everyday sort
of people, and this isn't normal.

33:25.360 --> 33:26.686
This isn't "everyday."

33:26.720 --> 33:28.285
They're not aristocrats.

33:44.960 --> 33:46.446
Okay.

33:51.080 --> 33:52.159
Oh.

33:52.160 --> 33:54.759
Do I even have to say it?

33:54.760 --> 33:56.799
I'm afraid so.

33:56.800 --> 33:59.959
Why in the world have you made
Mrs. Banks a silly suffragette?

33:59.960 --> 34:03.239
I wonder if Emmeline P.
would agree with that adjective.

34:03.240 --> 34:05.159
Quite possibly, looking back.

34:05.160 --> 34:06.839
It does seem strange

34:06.840 --> 34:09.119
that Mrs. Banks allows her kids

34:09.120 --> 34:12.518
to spend all of their time with the nanny,
when she doesn't have a job to speak of.

34:12.520 --> 34:14.478
Are you calling
Mrs. Banks neglectful?

34:14.480 --> 34:16.359
- Yep.
- No, of course not.

34:16.360 --> 34:18.679
We just thought that giving her a
job would go some way to explain...

34:18.679 --> 34:20.118
Being a mother is a job.

34:20.119 --> 34:21.319
It's a very difficult job,

34:21.320 --> 34:22.639
and one that not everyone is up to.

34:22.639 --> 34:25.359
One that not everyone should have
taken on in the first place.

34:25.360 --> 34:27.438
And I won't have her
called "Cynthia."

34:27.440 --> 34:30.639
Absolutely not. it feels...
it feels unlucky.

34:30.639 --> 34:33.047
It needs to be something warm.

34:33.159 --> 34:36.523
Something a bit,
I don't know, sexy.

34:37.000 --> 34:38.531
How about "Mavis"?

34:38.880 --> 34:40.081
Uh...

34:40.320 --> 34:41.679
- "Sybil"?
- Great.

34:41.679 --> 34:42.998
- "Prudence"?
- "Gwendolyn"?

34:43.000 --> 34:44.438
- Perfect.
- "Winifred."

34:44.440 --> 34:45.879
"Winifred?" "Winifred."

34:45.880 --> 34:47.366
I could go with "Winifred."

34:47.679 --> 34:50.087
That's because it's very good.

34:50.520 --> 34:53.518
This isn't Mr. Banks.
This isn't... This isn't him.

34:53.520 --> 34:54.679
Uh, yes, that's Mr. Banks.

34:54.679 --> 34:56.405
But he has a set of mustaches.

34:57.000 --> 34:58.719
In the book, he has them.

34:58.720 --> 35:01.239
I told the illustrator I did
not like the facial hair,

35:01.240 --> 35:02.479
but she chose to ignore me.

35:02.480 --> 35:04.479
Now this time around,
this is my film,

35:04.480 --> 35:05.719
and I shall have my way.

35:05.720 --> 35:09.079
Mrs. Travers, this is a
specific request from Walt.

35:09.080 --> 35:10.281
Why?

35:11.160 --> 35:13.639
- Well, I think he identifies...
- He didn't, he doesn't.

35:13.640 --> 35:15.399
Mr. Banks is clean-shaven.

35:15.400 --> 35:16.840
Does it matter?

35:17.680 --> 35:18.927
Bob...

35:21.720 --> 35:24.400
Does it matter?

35:24.520 --> 35:25.767
Bob...

35:27.720 --> 35:29.922
You can wait outside.

35:32.880 --> 35:35.447
I shan't say it again, Robert.

35:49.600 --> 35:51.359
What is wrong with his leg?

35:51.360 --> 35:52.561
He got shot.

35:53.120 --> 35:54.399
That's hardly surprising.

35:54.400 --> 35:56.728
Can I expect any more drama
from anyone else?

36:29.560 --> 36:31.330
Why do you do that?

36:32.600 --> 36:34.450
For you, my dear.

36:35.440 --> 36:38.325
Tell me, Gintamina,

36:39.560 --> 36:41.808
which kind of kisses do you prefer?

36:42.960 --> 36:45.639
Scratchy ones, or silky ones?

36:45.640 --> 36:47.842
Silky ones.

36:49.280 --> 36:52.165
Well, then, swish!

36:53.640 --> 36:55.080
Swoosh!

36:56.320 --> 37:00.320
A man must shave for to spare
his daughter's cheeks.

37:07.160 --> 37:08.239
Swish.

37:08.240 --> 37:09.680
Swoosh.

37:10.680 --> 37:12.370
Swoosh.

37:17.640 --> 37:20.479
<i>Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious</i>

37:20.480 --> 37:22.011
Stop! Stop! Stop!

37:22.160 --> 37:24.319
What on earth are
you talking about?

37:24.320 --> 37:26.319
"Supercali..."? "Supercal..."?

37:26.320 --> 37:28.159
Or whatever the infernal thing is.

37:28.160 --> 37:31.679
It's something you say when
you don't know what to say.

37:31.680 --> 37:33.689
Well, I always know what to say.

37:33.880 --> 37:36.519
If you so much as step
one foot in here with that trolley,

37:36.520 --> 37:38.199
I shall scream.

37:38.200 --> 37:40.926
One cannot live on cake alone.

37:42.720 --> 37:44.046
<i>Well, hit me with it.</i>

37:44.160 --> 37:48.410
She has a lot of ideas.

37:48.520 --> 37:50.199
Yeah? What kind of ideas?

37:52.040 --> 37:55.005
The name "Cynthia" has been
changed to "Winifred."

37:55.360 --> 37:56.891
Fine, fine, fine.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.799
She won't approve Dick Van Dyke.

38:03.640 --> 38:05.239
The sketches of the Banks house

38:05.240 --> 38:07.519
make it look too opulent.

38:07.520 --> 38:10.199
There must be no hint of romance

38:10.200 --> 38:12.999
between Mary Poppins and Bert.

38:13.000 --> 38:15.599
She wants to know why Mr. Banks
has been given a mustache.

38:15.600 --> 38:16.801
Oh, I asked for that.

38:16.880 --> 38:20.239
Yes, they told her that,
but she wants to know why.

38:20.240 --> 38:22.363
Because I asked for it.

38:22.920 --> 38:25.359
Right. Of course.

38:25.360 --> 38:27.239
Uh, the tape measure
Mary Poppins uses

38:27.240 --> 38:31.611
to record Jane and Michael's height
must be a roll tape, not a ruler.

38:31.760 --> 38:34.559
She only wants
green vegetables and broth.

38:34.560 --> 38:35.919
I don't know what that is,

38:35.920 --> 38:39.079
but she wants it in the room
from now on.

38:39.080 --> 38:40.399
And... Oh!

38:40.400 --> 38:44.082
She doesn't want
the color red in the film.

38:45.120 --> 38:46.719
At all.

38:46.720 --> 38:49.241
I've simply gone off the color.

38:49.360 --> 38:51.847
We can't make the picture
without the color red.

38:52.360 --> 38:54.449
The film is set in London,
for Pete's sake.

38:55.080 --> 38:56.119
And?

38:56.120 --> 38:59.563
Well, there's buses and mailboxes

39:00.560 --> 39:02.439
and guards' uniforms and things.

39:02.440 --> 39:04.199
And heck, the English flag.

39:04.200 --> 39:07.290
I understand your predicament,
Mr. Disney, I do.

39:07.600 --> 39:09.165
Uh, it's just...

39:09.440 --> 39:11.279
I don't know what it is.

39:11.280 --> 39:14.079
I'm suddenly very anti-red.

39:14.080 --> 39:16.123
I shan't be wearing it ever again.

39:16.720 --> 39:19.119
Is this a test, Pamela?

39:19.120 --> 39:22.119
Are you requiring proof as to how
much I want to make you happy,

39:22.120 --> 39:24.607
so we can create
this beautiful thing together?

39:26.160 --> 39:29.011
I took you at your word,
Mr. Disney.

39:29.120 --> 39:32.319
And it seems my first
stipulation has been denied.

39:32.320 --> 39:34.443
There will be many more.

39:34.640 --> 39:38.279
So, perhaps we should
just call it quits

39:38.280 --> 39:40.959
and I should hand you back these.

39:54.800 --> 39:56.525
All right.

39:56.920 --> 39:59.361
No red in the picture.

39:59.640 --> 40:01.410
- Walt.
- Walt!

40:01.600 --> 40:02.801
Wait.

40:13.320 --> 40:15.010
He doesn't have the rights.

40:15.680 --> 40:17.041
Quite.

40:23.000 --> 40:24.406
Tommie?

40:27.320 --> 40:29.204
Scotch Mist?

40:30.520 --> 40:31.926
What do you think?

40:32.480 --> 40:33.959
What do I think, what?

40:33.960 --> 40:35.199
You're a woman.

40:35.200 --> 40:37.687
Oh, that's a canny observation, Walt.

40:37.720 --> 40:39.639
What am I missing here?

40:40.800 --> 40:44.639
You think the female of the species
has some sort of psychic insight

40:44.640 --> 40:47.039
when it comes to
others of her kind?

40:47.040 --> 40:48.571
We don't.

40:49.160 --> 40:52.762
You're gonna get an ulcer
with all that unriddling.

40:52.880 --> 40:55.048
Give it up.

40:56.480 --> 40:58.682
That woman.

41:33.360 --> 41:35.439
Good afternoon, ma'am.
What can I fix you?

41:35.440 --> 41:37.961
A pot of tea, if you please.

41:38.240 --> 41:39.726
Sure thing.

41:54.640 --> 41:55.966
Ma'am.

41:58.600 --> 42:02.805
Tea is balm for the soul,
don't you agree?

42:13.080 --> 42:14.359
Catch the chook!

42:14.360 --> 42:15.766
Grab her!

42:20.440 --> 42:23.279
Girls, will you please just stop?

42:24.520 --> 42:27.849
It's okay, it's okay.
I know, I know.

42:28.640 --> 42:30.046
In you go.

42:31.160 --> 42:32.639
All right?

42:35.080 --> 42:37.851
It's okay.

42:37.960 --> 42:39.679
Ahoy, Goffs! Ahoy!

42:39.680 --> 42:41.279
Father!

42:41.280 --> 42:44.159
Whoa! That's better.

42:46.640 --> 42:48.679
What a wonderful surprise.

42:48.680 --> 42:50.211
Did you finish early?

42:50.320 --> 42:53.359
No, I couldn't stop thinking
of my beautiful girls

42:53.360 --> 42:56.479
on this beautiful day
in this beautiful place.

42:56.480 --> 42:58.959
And I thought, "To hell with it."

42:58.960 --> 43:00.519
But don't you have work to do?

43:00.520 --> 43:03.119
"But, but, but."

43:04.200 --> 43:06.679
Butts are for goats, my love.

43:09.520 --> 43:12.246
I'll put in extra hours tomorrow.

43:14.680 --> 43:16.199
A gift of a pear for milady.

43:18.640 --> 43:19.841
Thank you.

43:21.320 --> 43:23.799
Now, what are we playing?

43:23.800 --> 43:25.639
The hen got out and we've
been trying to catch her.

43:25.640 --> 43:26.921
Ah.

43:33.000 --> 43:35.248
That's no hen.

43:37.400 --> 43:41.767
That's Aunt Ellie, your
mother's horrendiferous sister!

43:41.880 --> 43:43.319
That's a made-up word.

43:43.320 --> 43:44.567
Yes, it is.

43:44.880 --> 43:46.759
Hurry, catch her before
she flies away on the...

43:46.760 --> 43:48.007
West wind!

43:48.240 --> 43:49.566
West wind.

43:49.760 --> 43:51.679
- Quick, get Aunt Ellie!
- Ellie!

43:51.680 --> 43:52.881
Come on, Biddy!

44:01.680 --> 44:03.086
That way.

44:03.600 --> 44:05.759
Oh, she's a foul fowl!

44:05.760 --> 44:07.962
Get Aunt Ellie!

44:08.240 --> 44:09.566
Come on.

44:12.440 --> 44:14.290
Grab her!

44:14.560 --> 44:17.127
Hurry, Sergeant Ginty!
Fell the beast!

44:18.560 --> 44:20.959
Darling, it's just that
I'm a little scared.

44:20.960 --> 44:25.290
Meg, sweet,
I had a throat scratch.

44:26.640 --> 44:29.571
But the bank is getting
you down again.

44:30.400 --> 44:31.559
Perhaps my sister can help.

44:31.560 --> 44:34.081
No. God, no.

44:37.240 --> 44:41.001
I can endure. I will endure.

44:41.640 --> 44:44.844
For the girls. Just, please...

44:45.720 --> 44:47.479
Oh, God, not Ellie.

45:05.400 --> 45:08.001
She's a foul fowl.

45:10.840 --> 45:12.599
It's gotta be like a slogan.

45:12.600 --> 45:14.131
Her prescription for life.

45:14.200 --> 45:15.279
"An apple a day?'

45:15.280 --> 45:17.359
"A stitch in time."

45:17.360 --> 45:19.881
"Time and tide wait for no man."

45:24.800 --> 45:26.001
Sugar.

45:26.480 --> 45:27.799
"Sugar" Yeah?

45:27.800 --> 45:30.159
Jeff had vaccination day
at school yesterday.

45:30.160 --> 45:31.319
- Ouch.
- No ouch.

45:31.320 --> 45:32.885
- No ouch?
- Sugar.

45:33.760 --> 45:35.319
They put it in a cube.

45:35.320 --> 45:36.799
Medicine in sugar?

45:36.800 --> 45:38.809
"Cube" is an odd word.

45:40.520 --> 45:41.881
"Spoonful."

45:43.520 --> 45:45.882
You need sugar? We have sugar.

45:46.600 --> 45:50.199
Well, morning!
May I walk with you?

45:50.200 --> 45:53.999
I'm sure there aren't any laws
in your country against it.

45:54.000 --> 45:56.439
<i>A robin feathering his nest</i>

45:56.440 --> 45:58.927
<i>Has very little time to rest</i>

45:59.000 --> 46:00.406
Go back to the chorus.

46:02.000 --> 46:08.359
<i>For a spoonful of sugar
helps the medicine go down</i>

46:08.360 --> 46:09.891
<i>The medicine...</i>

46:10.640 --> 46:12.888
It's not... It's missing...

46:13.200 --> 46:14.561
Wait.

46:15.480 --> 46:17.679
She always does the unexpected.

46:17.680 --> 46:18.799
Mmm-hmm.

46:18.800 --> 46:20.684
She goes up the banisters.

46:21.000 --> 46:22.406
Go up!

46:23.360 --> 46:27.199
<i>Just a spoonful of sugar</i>

46:27.200 --> 46:29.839
<i>Helps the medicine go down</i>

46:29.840 --> 46:31.519
That's it, that's it, that's it.

46:32.720 --> 46:33.839
Man is in the forest.

46:33.840 --> 46:35.199
I want you to play that for him.

46:35.200 --> 46:38.449
Walt, hold on.
I want you to hear this.

46:39.080 --> 46:41.439
- It's just the chorus.
- Tell us what you think.

46:42.680 --> 46:43.879
He knows

46:48.600 --> 46:54.559
<i>For a spoonful of sugar
helps the medicine go down</i>

46:54.560 --> 46:58.759
<i>The medicine go down
The medicine go down</i>

46:58.760 --> 47:03.959
<i>Just a spoonful of sugar
helps the medicine go down</i>

47:07.760 --> 47:09.359
We'll... We'll work out
the rest of the lyrics.

47:09.360 --> 47:10.559
You see how it goes up
on the word "down"?

47:10.560 --> 47:11.759
On the word "down," it goes up.

47:11.760 --> 47:12.799
It's ironic.

47:12.800 --> 47:15.199
Oh, forget "ironic."
It's iconic.

47:15.200 --> 47:17.399
I won't be able to stop
singing that for weeks.

47:19.080 --> 47:22.919
Well, it seems enormously
patronizing to me.

47:22.920 --> 47:24.439
Just the sort of annoying tune
you'd have playing

47:24.440 --> 47:25.919
in your themed park, I daresay.

47:25.920 --> 47:29.799
All giddy and carefree, encouraging
children to face the world unarmed.

47:29.800 --> 47:31.919
All they need is a
spoon and some sugar

47:31.920 --> 47:35.799
and a brain full of fluff and
they're equipped with life's tools.

47:35.800 --> 47:37.001
Wonderful.

47:38.440 --> 47:39.759
What's your point, Pam?

47:39.760 --> 47:41.759
"Mrs. Travers," please.

47:41.760 --> 47:43.639
My point is that, unlike yourself,

47:43.640 --> 47:46.810
Mary Poppins is the very enemy
of whimsy and sentiment.

47:46.960 --> 47:48.159
She's truthful.

47:48.160 --> 47:50.279
She doesn't sugarcoat
the darkness in the world

47:50.280 --> 47:53.799
that these children will eventually,
inevitably come to know.

47:53.800 --> 47:56.279
She prepares them for it.
She deals in honesty.

47:56.280 --> 47:57.799
One must clean one's room.

47:57.800 --> 47:59.759
It won't magically do it by itself.

47:59.760 --> 48:03.439
This entire script is flim-flam. Hmm?

48:03.440 --> 48:06.479
Where is its heart?
Where is its reality?

48:06.480 --> 48:10.002
Where is the gravitas?

48:20.440 --> 48:22.369
No weight, Mr. Disney.

48:24.600 --> 48:25.801
See?

48:27.120 --> 48:30.719
"No whimsy or sentiment"
says the woman

48:30.720 --> 48:33.319
who sent a flying nanny
with a talking umbrella

48:33.320 --> 48:34.681
to save the children.

48:35.280 --> 48:38.848
You think Mary Poppins has come
to save the children, Mr. Disney?

48:42.880 --> 48:44.366
Oh, dear.

48:53.360 --> 48:54.519
Mr. Belhatchett.

48:54.520 --> 48:55.767
Good afternoon.

48:57.400 --> 48:59.045
After you, my dear.

49:00.360 --> 49:02.244
Allow me.

49:06.040 --> 49:07.239
or if I'm five minutes late

49:07.240 --> 49:08.519
opening his stupid bank!

49:08.520 --> 49:10.639
Well, then, he'll take to me

49:10.640 --> 49:12.879
with the business end
of his beautiful hatchet!

49:12.880 --> 49:14.359
There! Whack!

49:14.360 --> 49:16.881
"Take that for not dropping
your bairns on schedule!"

49:17.000 --> 49:21.199
Whack! "Go on, then!
Take that! Take that!"

49:29.880 --> 49:31.719
- Mr. Belhatchett...
- I want you gone.

49:37.400 --> 49:39.090
Ginty.

49:41.240 --> 49:44.091
Sweet thing,
what are you doing here?

49:45.440 --> 49:48.239
You said today was ice cream day.

49:48.240 --> 49:52.081
Ice cream day. Yes, I did.

49:52.240 --> 49:53.885
Of course, of course.

49:55.200 --> 49:58.290
What kind of a father am I?
Come here.

50:00.960 --> 50:03.003
Are you fired again?

50:05.400 --> 50:07.759
Yes.
It does seem that...

50:07.760 --> 50:11.442
No, sweetheart. No.

50:11.640 --> 50:13.251
He's not.

50:16.560 --> 50:19.331
Darling, wait inside for a second.

50:20.960 --> 50:22.079
Mr. Belhatchett...

50:22.080 --> 50:25.090
If you can't straighten up
for your own sake,

50:25.240 --> 50:27.279
do it for your daughter.

50:27.280 --> 50:28.925
Irresponsible.

50:53.600 --> 50:56.690
We share a Celtic soul, you and I.

50:57.760 --> 50:59.689
This world,

51:00.440 --> 51:02.881
it's just an illusion,
Ginty old girl.

51:04.280 --> 51:05.919
As long as we hold
that thought dear,

51:05.920 --> 51:07.724
they can't break us.

51:08.000 --> 51:11.363
They can't make us
endure their reality.

51:12.320 --> 51:14.807
Bleak and bloody as it is.

51:18.000 --> 51:21.886
Money. Money, money.

51:23.960 --> 51:26.640
Don't you buy into it, Ginty.

51:28.840 --> 51:30.724
It'll bite you on the bottom.

51:45.480 --> 51:48.251
I loathe this place, Mr. Russell.

51:49.040 --> 51:51.479
It's bringing up these...

51:51.480 --> 51:54.251
Well, it's so hot and stuffy.

51:54.920 --> 51:57.282
I feel as if I'm being attacked.

51:57.560 --> 51:59.719
There's these odd dreams,

51:59.720 --> 52:02.239
as if my subconscious
were after me,

52:02.240 --> 52:05.879
punishing me for
entertaining the idea

52:05.880 --> 52:09.402
that I might hand her over.

52:10.400 --> 52:13.604
I'm at war with myself,
Mr. Russell.

52:15.360 --> 52:17.642
The script is ghastly.

52:18.040 --> 52:21.403
Empty pap, just as I expected.

52:22.880 --> 52:27.051
Yes. A few more days,
then I'll decide.

52:42.760 --> 52:44.121
Oh.

52:53.920 --> 52:55.804
Serves me right.

52:56.760 --> 53:01.807
Money, money, money.
It bit me on the butt.

53:28.800 --> 53:34.848
<i>Feed the birds,
tuppence a bag</i>

53:35.280 --> 53:42.119
<i>Tuppence, tuppence, tuppence a bag</i>

53:42.120 --> 53:48.407
<i>Feed the birds
That's what she cries</i>

53:48.600 --> 53:54.799
<i>While overhead,
her birds fill the skies</i>

53:54.800 --> 54:01.359
<i>All around the cathedral
the saints and apostles</i>

54:01.360 --> 54:06.168
<i>Look down as she sells her wares</i>

54:07.160 --> 54:13.199
<i>Although you can't see it
You know they are smiling</i>

54:13.200 --> 54:20.363
<i>Each time someone
shows that he cares</i>

54:21.680 --> 54:27.569
<i>Though her words are simple and few</i>

54:27.840 --> 54:34.764
<i>Listen, listen
She's calling to you</i>

54:35.040 --> 54:41.930
<i>Feed the birds, tuppence a bag</i>

54:42.520 --> 54:44.882
<i>Tuppence</i>

54:46.200 --> 54:48.243
<i>Tuppence</i>

54:50.000 --> 54:56.401
<i>Tuppence a bag</i>

54:59.400 --> 55:01.409
That'll work.

55:03.840 --> 55:06.805
But she's gonna say no, isn't she?

55:08.760 --> 55:11.247
The woman is a conundrum.

55:25.920 --> 55:28.771
<i>My world was calm</i>

55:28.920 --> 55:32.599
<i>Well ordered, exemplary</i>

55:32.600 --> 55:34.079
"Exemplary."

55:34.080 --> 55:38.959
<i>Then came this person
with chaos in her wake</i>

55:42.040 --> 55:47.079
<i>And now my life's ambitions go</i>

55:47.080 --> 55:51.444
<i>With one fell blow</i>

55:51.720 --> 55:58.485
<i>It's quite a bitter pill to take</i>

55:59.280 --> 56:02.370
Inspired by someone we know?

56:02.640 --> 56:04.649
You'd have to ask Bob.

56:06.160 --> 56:07.559
She might surprise us all.

56:07.560 --> 56:09.599
No, no, no, she won't.

56:09.600 --> 56:11.199
You don't know that.

56:11.200 --> 56:12.890
No, I do. I do know it.

56:13.240 --> 56:15.602
I know it only too well.

56:15.960 --> 56:18.959
I fought this battle from her side.

56:18.960 --> 56:21.003
Pat Powers.

56:21.600 --> 56:26.119
Oh, he wanted the mouse, and I didn't
have a bean in my pocket back then.

56:26.120 --> 56:29.119
He was this big, terrifying
New York producer,

56:29.120 --> 56:32.563
I was just a kid from Missouri
with a sketch of Mickey.

56:33.640 --> 56:36.319
It would've killed
me to give him up.

56:36.320 --> 56:38.966
Honest to God, would've killed me.

56:40.320 --> 56:43.330
That mouse is family.

56:51.000 --> 56:52.645
Go home.

57:10.720 --> 57:12.888
This world,

57:13.320 --> 57:16.330
<i>it's just an illusion, Ginty old girl.</i>

57:28.760 --> 57:32.248
Ah, the Countess Mary Sparklestick.

57:32.880 --> 57:36.359
Pray tell me, what are you
concentrating so hard on?

57:36.360 --> 57:37.879
I'm laying eggs.

57:37.880 --> 57:40.559
Really? Fabulous.

57:40.560 --> 57:41.879
Today, I'm a hen.

57:41.880 --> 57:44.481
Indeed.

57:44.520 --> 57:47.405
I can see the feathers
sprouting as we speak.

57:47.920 --> 57:50.559
Helen Goff, will you lay
the table for supper, please?

57:50.560 --> 57:51.639
I'm not Helen.

57:51.640 --> 57:54.570
She can't possibly lay the
table, she's busy laying eggs.

57:55.720 --> 57:57.279
Helen, will you lay the table
for supper, please?

57:57.280 --> 57:58.481
She's laying!

58:04.880 --> 58:05.999
Sorry.

58:08.880 --> 58:09.959
I should...

58:09.960 --> 58:11.491
Ginty.

58:13.400 --> 58:16.604
Don't you ever stop dreaming,
Ginty, my love.

58:17.520 --> 58:19.639
You can be anyone you want to be.

58:19.640 --> 58:20.759
Anyone.

58:20.760 --> 58:23.281
I want to be just like you.

58:27.040 --> 58:28.241
Don't.

58:29.080 --> 58:30.691
Don't.

59:26.640 --> 59:28.763
Are you all right, Mrs.?

59:33.240 --> 59:34.680
<i>Mrs. Travers?</i>

59:37.520 --> 59:39.051
Mrs. Travers.

59:40.160 --> 59:42.759
We were saying we'd like to
play you the song in the bank.

59:42.760 --> 59:43.919
Would that be good?

59:43.920 --> 59:45.121
Mmm.

59:45.600 --> 59:46.881
Okay.

59:47.960 --> 59:49.679
<i>Fidelity Fiduciary Bank.</i>

59:50.720 --> 59:52.922
I am Dawes.

59:53.160 --> 59:55.159
"So, you have tuppence.

59:55.160 --> 59:57.362
"May I be permitted to see it?

59:57.680 --> 59:59.159
"No, I want it

59:59.160 --> 01:00:01.279
"to feed the birds," Michael says.

01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:02.759
"Fiddlesticks, boy!

01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:05.042
"Feed the birds and
what have you got?"

01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:06.446
Fat birds!

01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:07.559
But...

01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:11.924
<i>If you invest your tuppence
Wisely in the bank</i>

01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:15.563
<i>Safe and sound</i>

01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:18.879
<i>Soon the tuppence
Safely invested in the bank</i>

01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:41.279
Mrs. Brill says Father
is presenting the medals.

01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:44.159
He is, indeed.
On behalf of the bank.

01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:46.559
Maybe he'll pin one on me
for the maypole.

01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:48.125
He might.

01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:50.005
Where is Father?

01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:53.330
I think he's practicing
his speech somewhere.

01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:54.919
Two, please.

01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:00.959
<i>And you'll achieve</i>

01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:03.083
<i>That sense of conquest</i>

01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:08.371
<i>As your affluence expands</i>

01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:13.569
<i>In the hands of the directors</i>

01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:18.130
<i>Who invest as propriety demands</i>

01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:21.240
Father!

01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:13.439
Back in Ireland. Ah!

01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:16.291
I miss her green hills so.

01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:40.359
Why is he speaking for the bank?

01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:42.519
He is the manager, sir.

01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:43.719
He looks terrible.

01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:46.924
Good afternoon,
distinguished guests,

01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:50.201
our biggest supporter,
Mr. Randolph Belhatchett,

01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:53.959
and his lovely wife.

01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:56.606
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls.

01:02:56.680 --> 01:02:59.439
I'm honored to be here on behalf of

01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:01.802
the Belhatchett Bank of Australia.

01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:04.319
Shortly, it will, uh...

01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:06.159
it will be my very pleasant duty

01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:09.679
to present the awards
to our young performers.

01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:13.959
But, we, uh... But before I begin,

01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:17.879
allow me a very few words to
our very youngest citizens

01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:20.399
about the, uh... About the, uh,

01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:24.719
the role of the bank
in our community.

01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:29.528
<i>When you deposit tuppence
in a bank account</i>

01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:30.879
<i>Soon...</i>

01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:32.161
Soon, you'll see...

01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:36.239
<i>that it blooms into credit of</i> a...

01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:38.079
generous amount.

01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:41.759
<i>Semiannually</i>

01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:46.090
<i>And you'll achieve
that sense of stature</i>

01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:51.039
<i>As your influence expands</i>

01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:52.559
<i>To the high</i>

01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:54.967
<i>Financial strata</i>

01:03:55.640 --> 01:03:59.606
<i>That established credit now commands</i>

01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:02.959
<i>You can purchase
first and second trust deeds</i>

01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:04.999
<i>- Think of the...</i>
- Foreclosures!

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.799
<i>- Bonds!
- Chattels!</i>

01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:08.719
<i>- Dividends!
- Shares!</i>

01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:10.799
<i>- Bankruptcies!
- Debtor sales!</i>

01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:12.239
<i>Opportunities!</i>

01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:13.439
All manner of...

01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:14.639
Private enterprise!

01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:16.519
- Shipyards!
<i>- The Mercantile!</i>

01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:18.159
<i>- Collieries!
- Tanneries!</i>

01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:19.359
Incorporations!

01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:20.599
<i>Amalgamations!</i>

01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:22.040
- Banks!
- Banks!

01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:27.681
Thanking you kindly. Thank you.

01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:38.719
I, um...

01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:40.159
Where was I?

01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:41.279
Ah!

01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:43.079
Oh, yeah.

01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:48.326
It's a marvelous thing to encourage
our children to open bank accounts.

01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:50.439
Marvelous thing!

01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:54.440
My, my, uh... My daughter,
the Princess Ginty!

01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:56.324
She's... She's...

01:04:58.680 --> 01:04:59.927
Uh, how old are you?

01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:05.922
Ginty, come up. Come up here.

01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:10.531
Come, Ginty.

01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:24.925
Ginty has an account,
and that's good!

01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:27.086
Well, give her a drink!

01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:29.969
I mean, give her a hand.

01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:43.199
I shall return in
just a few moments

01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:44.439
to present the awards.

01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:47.530
But right now,

01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:49.851
I need to relieve myself.

01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:53.084
Give us your shoulder,
Ginty, will you?

01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:56.086
I'm bursting. There's a good girl.

01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:12.119
<i>In the Dawes</i>

01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:15.399
<i>Tomes, Mousely, Grubbs</i>

01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:18.679
<i>Fidelity Fiduciary</i>

01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:22.965
<i>Bank</i>

01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:24.719
I think it works.

01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:25.959
It's getting close.

01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:28.399
Why did you have to
make him so cruel?

01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:30.762
He was not a monster!

01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:33.439
Who are we talking about?
I'm confused.

01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:34.999
You all have children, yes?

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:36.119
Yes, yes.

01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:38.199
And do those children
make letters for you?

01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:40.599
Do they write letters?
Do they make you drawings?

01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:44.486
And would you tear up
those gifts in front of them?

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.159
It's a dreadful thing to do.
I don't understand.

01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:49.879
Why must Father tear up
the advertisement

01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:51.279
his children have made,

01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:53.319
and throw it in the fireplace?

01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:54.839
Why won't he mend their kite?

01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:57.964
Why have you made him
so unspeakably awful?

01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:03.199
In glorious Technicolor,
for all the world to see?

01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:06.404
If you claim to make them live,
why can't he...

01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:09.731
They live well?

01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:14.089
I can't bear it. Please, don't.

01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:16.087
Please, don't.

01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:19.051
I feel like I let him down again.

01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:22.410
Mrs. Travers?

01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:30.240
I don't suppose you can
give me any more for the pain?

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.679
When will enough be enough,
Travers?

01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:39.927
Hmm?

01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:50.201
I brought you something,
Father.

01:07:52.280 --> 01:07:54.881
Be a darling, Ginty, my old pal.

01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:57.000
Come here.

01:07:57.960 --> 01:07:59.525
Come here. Come close.

01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:03.480
I'm sick.

01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:05.650
You'll help Father out,
won't you?

01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:12.171
In my washroom,

01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:14.959
there's a bottle of medicine
that Father needs.

01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:16.479
Mother took it away.

01:08:16.479 --> 01:08:17.879
Oh, God damn it!

01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:23.566
I wrote you a poem, Father.

01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:29.569
It won first place at school.

01:08:31.399 --> 01:08:34.126
Shall I read it to you, Father?

01:08:58.479 --> 01:09:01.046
It's hardly Yeats, is it?

01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:20.451
Mrs.?

01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:25.649
I, uh... I brought you a tea.

01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:28.770
It's blasphemy to drink tea
from a paper cup.

01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:30.759
Oh. Uh...

01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:32.086
Here.

01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:37.610
Is everything okay, Mrs.?

01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:42.043
Would you like me
to drive you home?

01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:44.681
All the way to England?
Yes, please.

01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:49.319
You, uh... You got family
back there, Mrs.?

01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:50.759
You're an impertinent man,
you know?

01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:54.119
You ask an awful lot of questions
that have absolutely no relevance

01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:56.279
to your being able
to carry out your duties.

01:10:58.240 --> 01:11:00.239
I know. Yeah, I do, do that, yes.

01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:02.727
And you have no barometer.

01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:07.919
Let's just say I haven't family

01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:10.519
who would notice whether
I were halfway across the world

01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:13.963
or sitting in my living room.

01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:18.479
Make a furrow. There.

01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:20.205
That's a good stick for digging.

01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:22.324
- A furrow?
- Yes.

01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:23.800
All right.

01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:32.485
I got a kid.

01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:35.004
Most people do.

01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:36.811
Jane.

01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:38.681
Yeah.

01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:41.045
What a terrific kid.

01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:45.399
Beautiful little girl.

01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:48.599
She's got a lot of problems,
though.

01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:51.087
She's handicapped, you know?

01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:55.524
She's in a wheelchair.

01:11:57.120 --> 01:12:00.730
See, and that's why I concern
myself with the weather so much.

01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:04.841
Sunny day, she can sit outside
in the garden.

01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:09.802
Rainy day, I gotta leave her
cooped up inside.

01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:15.328
I worry about the future,

01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:18.643
but you can't do that.

01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:21.366
Only today.

01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:23.881
Mmm.

01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:25.565
Yeah.

01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:29.486
Now, look.

01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:30.926
It's a bandstand.

01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:32.525
Ah!

01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:36.319
Ah! A river!

01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:38.284
- Lake.
- Lake.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:40.201
Hmm.

01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:43.563
Hey, hey, hey, I sure would
like to take her there.

01:12:43.800 --> 01:12:45.729
Wouldn't that be nice?

01:12:58.400 --> 01:12:59.726
Mother?

01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:06.041
I know you gave it to him.

01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:12.889
Take care of your sisters.

01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:14.921
What?

01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:17.609
I know you love your father more.

01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:25.450
But one day, you will understand.

01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:33.766
Hmm.

01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:40.051
Mother!

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:54.201
Mother?

01:13:56.600 --> 01:13:58.450
Mother!

01:13:58.720 --> 01:13:59.999
Mother!

01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:25.764
Come on, Albert.

01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:46.521
Mother!

01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:52.481
Please!

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:55.361
Mother!

01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:04.001
Mother!

01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:08.041
Mother!

01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:21.488
It's time to go home.

01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:32.409
I'm sorry.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.079
Oh, my God.

01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:38.089
I'm sorry.

01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:47.566
Yes, that will be very good.

01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:48.928
Let's have that.

01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:52.839
I think we should
go with Frida Kahlo.

01:15:58.640 --> 01:16:00.968
Mrs. Travers. Yes?

01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:05.685
Pam. Walt.

01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:07.599
Mr. Disney.

01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:10.919
I'm calling to, uh...
Well, to check up on you.

01:16:10.920 --> 01:16:13.599
<i>I understand things
didn't go so well today.</i>

01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:15.679
<i>Something about Mr. Banks?</i>

01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:18.359
They went as well as they've gone on
every other day that I've been here.

01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:21.599
I don't recall any special phone calls
from you on any of those other evenings.

01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:22.847
<i>Pam,</i>

01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:25.719
what's this all about?

01:16:25.720 --> 01:16:26.921
I mean, really?

01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:30.486
I'm wondering what I have
to do to make you happy.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:32.119
Oh.

01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:35.369
<i>And you're wondering that,
too, aren't you?</i>

01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:39.719
You know, you've never
been to Disneyland,

01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:41.684
<i>and that's the happiest place on earth.</i>

01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:44.159
Tommie!
Cancel my morning tomorrow.

01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:45.679
I'm gonna take a ride
with my favorite author.

01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:47.599
No, no, no, please, Mr. Disney,

01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:51.839
I cannot begin to tell you how
uninterested, no, positively sickened I am

01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:55.319
at the thought of visiting
your dollar-printing machine.

01:16:55.320 --> 01:16:56.959
Well, for crying out loud,

01:16:56.960 --> 01:16:58.559
when does anybody
get to go to Disneyland

01:16:58.560 --> 01:17:00.359
with Walt Disney himself?

01:17:00.360 --> 01:17:02.359
Disappointments are to the soul

01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:04.562
what the thunderstorm
is to the air.

01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:08.210
Hello?

01:17:12.280 --> 01:17:13.439
He...

01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:15.244
He hung up. He hung up.

01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:27.329
Guys, we gotta fix this.

01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:40.201
Father, wind's from the east.

01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:44.125
The aunt.

01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:11.289
Oh, dear.

01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:19.931
Now...

01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:25.002
I've brought every newfangled
treatment available in Sydney.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.680
Close your mouth, Biddy.
We are not a codfish.

01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:39.801
Hmm.

01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:46.966
Now, I see a multitude of jobs
that need to be done.

01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:49.999
I've just been, um...
I've been so worried.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.089
Oh, stop your babbling nonsense.

01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:56.085
I'm here now,
and I shall fix everything.

01:18:57.440 --> 01:19:00.969
I thought I made it perfectly clear
that you two ought to start helping.

01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:03.121
Hmm?

01:19:04.520 --> 01:19:05.721
Spit-spot!

01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:09.879
Where are we?

01:19:09.880 --> 01:19:11.199
This isn't the way.

01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:13.687
Change of venue this morning,
apparently.

01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:15.441
Oh...

01:19:32.720 --> 01:19:34.285
Wow!

01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:36.291
There he is!

01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:38.439
Living and breathing.

01:19:39.680 --> 01:19:41.609
Oh, boy!

01:19:55.600 --> 01:19:57.450
Oh, I can get that.

01:19:57.800 --> 01:20:01.482
Mrs. Travers, welcome
to the Magic Kingdom.

01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:07.999
Is it all like this?

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:09.247
Yep.

01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:10.679
Isn't it wonderful?

01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:11.719
Hey.

01:20:11.720 --> 01:20:13.888
Do you always get
everything you want, Walter?

01:20:14.680 --> 01:20:15.759
Pretty much.

01:20:15.760 --> 01:20:18.359
With the exception of the
rights to my books, of course.

01:20:18.360 --> 01:20:20.919
Well, the war ain't over yet, Pam.

01:20:20.920 --> 01:20:22.679
The war ain't over yet.

01:20:22.680 --> 01:20:23.719
I love you so much.

01:20:23.720 --> 01:20:25.279
Oh, ho!

01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:28.006
Sure, sure. Here you go.

01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:30.639
Here you go.

01:20:30.640 --> 01:20:31.759
Pre-signed?

01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:32.959
Hey, you should get hers, too.

01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:35.845
This woman is a bona fide genius.

01:20:38.080 --> 01:20:40.806
The tour starts this way, Pam.

01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:43.004
Hot dog.

01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:44.919
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

01:20:44.920 --> 01:20:47.319
Move along, move along.
Up, up, up, up!

01:20:47.320 --> 01:20:49.284
That's good. That's good.

01:20:51.800 --> 01:20:54.279
Each section of the
park has a high point

01:20:54.280 --> 01:20:56.319
so you can get your bearings.

01:20:56.320 --> 01:20:59.999
In Adventureland, there's a tree.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.362
This is a fun fact,
this is a titbit.

01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:03.639
"Tidbit."

01:21:03.640 --> 01:21:07.999
It's got three million leaves,
four million flowers.

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.567
- Gosh.
- They said only God could make a tree.

01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:14.768
Mr. Disney, sir,
would you mind signing this?

01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:18.359
No. Do you one better.
Here you go, have a great day.

01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:20.050
Oh. Thank you so much.

01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:28.209
- Mr. Disney!
- Hey.

01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:32.288
Where did she come from?

01:21:33.080 --> 01:21:34.359
Who?

01:21:34.360 --> 01:21:36.005
Oh, I think you know.

01:21:36.200 --> 01:21:39.529
She flew in through the
window one day.

01:21:39.680 --> 01:21:41.919
"Flew in through the window."

01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:45.408
It was just that easy,
was it, Mrs. Travers?

01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:49.159
Do you see those spires?

01:21:49.160 --> 01:21:51.399
Plated with 24-karat gold.

01:21:51.400 --> 01:21:52.479
Roy was against it,

01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:54.719
so I waited until he was
out of town to get it done.

01:21:54.720 --> 01:21:56.251
How clever.

01:21:56.320 --> 01:21:57.879
Now, I know
you don't want to be here,

01:21:57.880 --> 01:22:00.479
so, I'm just gonna
take you to one ride.

01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:03.039
My favorite amusement,
and then I'll set you free.

01:22:03.040 --> 01:22:04.279
Hello, Mr. Disney!

01:22:04.280 --> 01:22:07.239
Hello, folks, how are you?
Enjoy the day.

01:22:07.240 --> 01:22:08.399
Hey, kids.

01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:11.211
Ernie.

01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:12.999
- Welcome. Right this way.
- Thank you so much.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:14.399
Excuse me, please.

01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:18.999
Mrs. Travers, I would be honored if you
would take a ride on Jingles, here.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:20.964
This is Mrs. Disney's
favorite horse.

01:22:21.440 --> 01:22:24.405
No, thank you.
I'm happy to watch.

01:22:24.560 --> 01:22:26.319
Now, there's no
greater joy than that

01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:27.879
seen through the eyes of a child,

01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:30.319
and there's a little bit
of a child in all of us.

01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:33.649
Maybe in you, Mr. Disney,
but certainly not in me.

01:22:34.280 --> 01:22:35.766
Get on the horse, Pamela.

01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:44.919
Now, when we first met,

01:22:44.920 --> 01:22:47.566
you said to me, "They're family."

01:22:48.120 --> 01:22:49.199
I said what?

01:22:49.200 --> 01:22:52.370
Mary Poppins, the Banks.
They're family.

01:22:52.560 --> 01:22:55.479
The boys have come up with
an idea for your Mr. Banks.

01:22:55.480 --> 01:22:56.879
I think it's gonna make you happy.

01:22:56.880 --> 01:22:59.479
You didn't bring me all the
way out here to tell me that?

01:22:59.480 --> 01:23:00.639
Oh, no, no, no.

01:23:00.640 --> 01:23:03.127
I brought you all the way out
here for monetary gain.

01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:06.319
I had a wager with the boys.
Couldn't get you on a ride.

01:23:06.320 --> 01:23:07.439
I just won 20 bucks.

01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:25.447
I see you. I see you.

01:24:03.680 --> 01:24:05.848
Well begun is half done.

01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:08.730
There you go.

01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:12.964
Give it a whack, Biddy.
Nice and hard.

01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:49.285
Morning, Mrs. Travers.

01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:51.199
What horrors have you in store

01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:53.767
for my beautiful characters today?

01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:56.088
You sit here.

01:24:58.360 --> 01:24:59.846
All right.

01:25:00.440 --> 01:25:02.244
What are you up to?

01:25:03.880 --> 01:25:08.599
We were thinking
about what you said,

01:25:08.600 --> 01:25:10.768
and you're right.

01:25:12.280 --> 01:25:15.563
Mr. Banks isn't cruel. He isn't.

01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:20.650
So, we have a new
end for the film.

01:25:21.080 --> 01:25:23.442
Oh, God, I hope you like it.

01:25:38.840 --> 01:25:42.879
Michael says,
"He mended it. It's wonderful."

01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:45.367
"However did you manage it?"

01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:46.639
He mended the kite?

01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:55.251
<i>With tuppence
for paper and strings</i>

01:25:55.840 --> 01:25:59.203
<i>You can have your own set of wings</i>

01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:03.199
<i>With your feet on the ground
You're a bird in flight</i>

01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:05.879
<i>With your fist holding tight</i>

01:26:05.880 --> 01:26:08.719
<i>To the string of your kite</i>

01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:10.999
<i>Oh, oh, oh!</i>

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:14.599
<i>Let's go fly a kite</i>

01:26:14.600 --> 01:26:18.119
<i>Up to the highest height</i>

01:26:18.120 --> 01:26:21.559
<i>Let's go fly a kite</i>

01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:25.399
<i>And send it soaring</i>

01:26:25.400 --> 01:26:28.919
<i>Up through the atmosphere</i>

01:26:28.920 --> 01:26:32.679
<i>Up where the air is clear</i>

01:26:32.680 --> 01:26:37.879
<i>Oh, let's go fly a kite</i>

01:26:37.880 --> 01:26:41.639
Then, Mrs. Banks
runs through her house.

01:26:41.640 --> 01:26:44.719
She gets the suffragette ribbon,
and says...

01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:46.999
"A proper kite deserves
a proper tail,

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:48.199
"don't you think?"

01:26:48.200 --> 01:26:50.839
<i>Oh, oh, oh!</i>

01:26:50.840 --> 01:26:54.319
<i>Let's go fly a kite</i>

01:26:54.320 --> 01:26:57.879
<i>Up to the highest height</i>

01:26:57.880 --> 01:27:01.319
<i>Let's go fly a kite</i>

01:27:01.320 --> 01:27:05.159
<i>And send it soaring</i>

01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:09.039
<i>Up through the atmosphere</i>

01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:12.439
<i>Up where the air is clear</i>

01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:17.680
<i>Oh, let's go fly a kite</i>

01:27:19.240 --> 01:27:22.959
<i>When you send it flying up there</i>

01:27:22.960 --> 01:27:26.519
<i>All at once
You're lighter than air</i>

01:27:26.520 --> 01:27:28.399
<i>You can dance on the breeze</i>

01:27:28.400 --> 01:27:30.359
<i>Over houses and trees</i>

01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:32.799
<i>With your fist holding tight</i>

01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:35.082
<i>To the string of your kite</i>

01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:40.330
Mr. Disney! Walt!

01:27:40.440 --> 01:27:41.639
I'm sorry to interrupt.

01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:43.759
It's just that she's dancing.

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:48.044
Mrs. Travers.
She's dancing with Don.

01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:50.879
<i>Oh, oh, oh!</i>

01:27:50.880 --> 01:27:54.599
<i>Let's go fly a kite</i>

01:27:54.600 --> 01:27:58.039
<i>Up to the highest height</i>

01:27:58.040 --> 01:28:01.399
<i>Let's go fly a kite</i>

01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:05.199
<i>And send it soaring</i>

01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:08.839
<i>Up through the atmosphere</i>

01:28:08.840 --> 01:28:12.479
<i>Up where the air is clear</i>

01:28:12.480 --> 01:28:19.165
<i>Oh, let's go fly a kite</i>

01:28:21.160 --> 01:28:23.959
He... He fixes the kite.

01:28:23.960 --> 01:28:25.079
Oh, I love it.

01:28:27.400 --> 01:28:31.287
Although, the proper English would
be, "Let us go and fly a kite."

01:28:31.480 --> 01:28:34.604
<i>Let us go and fly a kite</i>

01:28:35.160 --> 01:28:37.488
I might be willing
to overlook that.

01:28:37.920 --> 01:28:39.565
All right.

01:28:39.720 --> 01:28:40.921
Very good.

01:28:51.960 --> 01:28:53.366
Look at you.

01:28:56.040 --> 01:28:58.811
I rewrote the poem, Father.

01:29:08.560 --> 01:29:10.603
The aunt gave me tuppence.

01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:14.531
Shall I buy you something, Father?

01:29:19.760 --> 01:29:21.450
Pears.

01:29:28.440 --> 01:29:30.165
Pears.

01:29:30.560 --> 01:29:32.250
Father.

01:29:34.360 --> 01:29:37.609
Tuppence for pears,
pears, pears, pears.

01:29:37.800 --> 01:29:40.731
Tuppence for pears,
pears, pears, pears.

01:29:51.960 --> 01:29:54.199
You're quite right, you know?
It is beautiful.

01:29:54.200 --> 01:29:55.731
Exquisite.

01:29:57.440 --> 01:29:59.051
It's always new.

01:30:07.040 --> 01:30:08.719
So, <i>Jolly Holiday</i> is in?

01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:09.839
Mmm. By all means.

01:30:09.840 --> 01:30:10.959
Wonderful.

01:30:10.960 --> 01:30:12.879
I do have a question
about it, actually.

01:30:12.880 --> 01:30:17.560
How in the world does Mr. Disney propose
to train all the penguins to dance?

01:30:18.160 --> 01:30:20.799
I've heard about his
implausibly-leaved trees.

01:30:20.800 --> 01:30:23.679
So, I presume he does have some
insane penguin-wrangling scheme.

01:30:23.680 --> 01:30:25.928
But it does seem a little
far-fetched, even for him.

01:30:25.960 --> 01:30:29.289
Can you train a penguin to dance?

01:30:29.480 --> 01:30:33.439
No, I don't think you can train...

01:30:33.440 --> 01:30:35.324
- They're animated.
- Dick...

01:30:37.840 --> 01:30:39.439
- They're what?
- Cartoons.

01:30:39.440 --> 01:30:40.846
Dick!

01:30:45.480 --> 01:30:46.681
What?

01:30:51.880 --> 01:30:53.844
Are we getting real penguins?

01:30:54.600 --> 01:30:56.882
Yes, 2:00, Tuesday.

01:30:57.600 --> 01:30:59.079
Good afternoon, Mrs. Travers.

01:30:59.080 --> 01:31:00.239
I'm here to see Mr. Disney.

01:31:00.240 --> 01:31:01.399
Oh, please, have a...

01:31:01.400 --> 01:31:02.679
Mrs. Travers, please!

01:31:02.680 --> 01:31:03.839
Disney!

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:07.850
Mrs. Travers?

01:31:09.040 --> 01:31:10.446
Mrs. Travers!

01:31:11.640 --> 01:31:12.999
I'm terribly sorry, Walt.

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.441
It's all right, Tommie.
Just close the door.

01:31:15.840 --> 01:31:17.839
I never let anyone see me smoking.

01:31:17.840 --> 01:31:20.399
I hate to encourage bad habits.

01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:21.839
Please, sit down.

01:31:21.840 --> 01:31:25.439
I shall not sit in the seat of a
trickster, a fraudster, a sneak!

01:31:25.440 --> 01:31:26.519
Pamela!

01:31:26.520 --> 01:31:28.484
"Mrs. Travers," please!

01:31:28.680 --> 01:31:31.724
Mrs. Travers,
what has you so upset now?

01:31:32.200 --> 01:31:33.879
Penguins.

01:31:33.880 --> 01:31:36.839
Penguins have very much
upset me, Mr. Disney.

01:31:36.840 --> 01:31:38.719
Animated dancing penguins.

01:31:38.720 --> 01:31:40.639
Now, you have...
You have seduced me

01:31:40.640 --> 01:31:42.039
with the music, Mr. Disney.
Yes, you have.

01:31:42.040 --> 01:31:44.239
Those Sherman boys have
quite turned my head.

01:31:44.240 --> 01:31:48.599
But I shall not be moved upon
the matter of cartoons, sir.

01:31:48.600 --> 01:31:51.167
Not one inch!

01:31:51.560 --> 01:31:53.119
It is a sequence.

01:31:53.120 --> 01:31:54.239
You promised me.

01:31:54.240 --> 01:31:57.919
You promised me that this film
would not be an animation!

01:31:57.920 --> 01:31:59.804
And it isn't.

01:32:02.200 --> 01:32:03.845
So, they're real penguins?

01:32:04.120 --> 01:32:06.641
No. No, they are animated.

01:32:07.120 --> 01:32:10.719
But the actors, you see, the
actors are very, very much real.

01:32:10.720 --> 01:32:12.729
Foolish old woman.

01:32:14.120 --> 01:32:16.846
Have a good day, Mr. Disney.

01:32:20.880 --> 01:32:22.206
Pamela.

01:32:22.800 --> 01:32:24.081
Pam!

01:32:29.960 --> 01:32:34.599
Oh, Dolly, would you be so kind as to ring
my driver, and ask him to collect me?

01:32:34.600 --> 01:32:35.801
Yes, ma'am.

01:32:36.440 --> 01:32:37.971
Thank you.

01:32:50.680 --> 01:32:52.769
Here we are, Mrs.

01:32:53.080 --> 01:32:54.850
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

01:33:05.080 --> 01:33:07.886
It's been a real pleasure
driving you, Mrs.

01:33:09.160 --> 01:33:10.559
No one likes a fibber.

01:33:10.560 --> 01:33:11.761
Oh, no, no.

01:33:12.360 --> 01:33:14.927
I really have enjoyed it.

01:33:17.200 --> 01:33:19.439
I didn't know who
you were at first.

01:33:19.440 --> 01:33:20.846
And then, guess what.

01:33:21.240 --> 01:33:22.599
You found out?

01:33:22.600 --> 01:33:25.679
I was telling my daughter
all about my day,

01:33:25.680 --> 01:33:28.559
and how I'm driving this nice
writer lady, Mrs. Travers,

01:33:28.560 --> 01:33:31.570
for Mr. Disney, and, uh...

01:33:33.160 --> 01:33:34.361
And?

01:33:35.200 --> 01:33:36.731
And...

01:33:38.440 --> 01:33:41.839
And she made me go to her bedroom,

01:33:41.840 --> 01:33:44.327
and bring her this.

01:33:45.320 --> 01:33:47.204
I can't stop reading it,
you know.

01:33:47.760 --> 01:33:50.770
I'm very slow, mind you, so...

01:33:51.240 --> 01:33:53.249
Would you like me to sign it?

01:33:53.520 --> 01:33:54.679
Would you?

01:33:54.680 --> 01:33:56.245
I'd be honored.

01:34:00.400 --> 01:34:01.761
Uh...

01:34:06.160 --> 01:34:07.279
Let me see, now.

01:34:07.280 --> 01:34:09.960
"To Jane

01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:14.766
"and her dearest father..."

01:34:16.360 --> 01:34:17.759
I've just this instant realized

01:34:17.760 --> 01:34:19.246
I don't know your name.

01:34:19.960 --> 01:34:21.161
Ralph.

01:34:21.800 --> 01:34:24.207
Pamela.

01:34:28.360 --> 01:34:31.119
You're the only American
I've ever liked, Ralph.

01:34:31.120 --> 01:34:33.448
Oh... Well, may I ask why?

01:34:33.880 --> 01:34:35.039
No.

01:34:35.040 --> 01:34:38.244
Now, take this.

01:34:38.720 --> 01:34:42.720
"Albert Einstein,
Van Gogh, Roosevelt.

01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:44.639
"Frida Kahlo."

01:34:44.640 --> 01:34:46.171
- "Kahlo."
- Kahlo.

01:34:47.160 --> 01:34:48.319
What is this?

01:34:48.320 --> 01:34:50.090
They all had difficulties.

01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:54.560
Jane can do anything
that anyone else can do.

01:34:54.720 --> 01:34:56.524
Do you understand?

01:35:00.920 --> 01:35:02.121
Oh.

01:35:02.400 --> 01:35:04.648
I almost forgot, turn it around.

01:35:06.160 --> 01:35:07.361
"Walt Disney."

01:35:07.560 --> 01:35:10.599
Hyperactive behavior
and deficiencies in concentration.

01:35:10.600 --> 01:35:13.007
It explains everything.

01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:18.888
Thank you, Mrs.

01:35:22.320 --> 01:35:25.999
She acted like an angry
person a lot of the time.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:27.119
Mmm-hmm.

01:35:27.120 --> 01:35:29.319
So, she's come and gone, huh?

01:35:29.320 --> 01:35:32.159
Yeah, her flight
left 10 minutes ago.

01:35:32.160 --> 01:35:35.319
Beverly Hills Hotel,
private limousine.

01:35:35.320 --> 01:35:38.330
First-class plane ticket
back to England for...

01:35:38.560 --> 01:35:40.888
Wait. "Goff"?

01:35:41.440 --> 01:35:43.639
Who is... Who is Helen Goff?

01:35:43.640 --> 01:35:45.559
That's her. That's her real name.

01:35:45.560 --> 01:35:47.519
She acts so hoity-toity British,

01:35:47.520 --> 01:35:49.563
and she's really an Aussie.

01:35:50.040 --> 01:35:52.402
Then who is Travers?

01:35:54.800 --> 01:35:57.571
I've been talking to
the wrong person?

01:36:18.440 --> 01:36:19.926
He's gone.

01:36:25.440 --> 01:36:26.687
No, no, no. You mustn't.

01:36:28.320 --> 01:36:29.851
Let her go, Margaret.

01:37:07.720 --> 01:37:10.082
I dropped the pears.

01:37:11.320 --> 01:37:14.000
I'm sorry, Daddy.

01:37:20.520 --> 01:37:22.039
Helen, dear girl...

01:37:22.040 --> 01:37:25.210
You promised you
would fix everything.

01:38:02.080 --> 01:38:03.850
Hello, house.

01:38:38.760 --> 01:38:40.200
Oh, dear God!

01:38:40.920 --> 01:38:43.239
It was one heck of a
job getting a seat

01:38:43.240 --> 01:38:46.011
on the very next flight,
let me tell you.

01:38:48.840 --> 01:38:50.799
Mrs. Travers,

01:38:50.800 --> 01:38:54.561
I could sure use a nice
pot of English tea about now.

01:39:02.640 --> 01:39:04.205
Here we are.

01:39:05.520 --> 01:39:07.165
Allow me.

01:39:08.360 --> 01:39:10.519
Milk in first, remember?

01:39:10.520 --> 01:39:12.722
Yeah, I remember.

01:39:13.640 --> 01:39:16.839
And a spoonful of sugar?

01:39:16.840 --> 01:39:18.485
NO, I think I'll have whisky.

01:39:19.240 --> 01:39:20.521
Oh.

01:39:22.040 --> 01:39:23.480
Ooh.

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:26.611
That's okay.

01:39:27.640 --> 01:39:30.320
Well, when in Rome...

01:39:36.600 --> 01:39:37.961
Thank you.

01:39:38.280 --> 01:39:40.839
You've come to change my mind,
haven't you?

01:39:40.840 --> 01:39:43.279
To beat me into submission.

01:39:43.280 --> 01:39:44.679
No. No.

01:39:44.680 --> 01:39:49.169
I've come because you misjudged me.

01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:54.359
How do I misjudge you?

01:39:54.360 --> 01:39:55.839
You look at me

01:39:55.840 --> 01:39:59.159
and you see some kind
of Hollywood King Midas.

01:39:59.160 --> 01:40:02.039
You think I've built an empire,
and I want your Mary Poppins

01:40:02.040 --> 01:40:04.919
as just another brick
in my kingdom.

01:40:04.920 --> 01:40:06.963
And don't you?

01:40:07.600 --> 01:40:09.839
Now, if that was all it was,

01:40:09.840 --> 01:40:12.119
would I have suckered up
to a cranky, stubborn dame

01:40:12.120 --> 01:40:14.399
like you for 20 years?

01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:16.841
No, I would have
saved myself an ulcer.

01:40:17.440 --> 01:40:19.130
No... You, uh...

01:40:19.360 --> 01:40:21.479
You expected me to disappoint you,

01:40:21.480 --> 01:40:23.205
and so you made sure I did.

01:40:25.440 --> 01:40:28.723
Well, I think life disappoints you,
Mrs. Travers.

01:40:29.040 --> 01:40:32.519
I think it's done that a lot, and I
think Mary Poppins is the only person

01:40:32.520 --> 01:40:34.165
in your life who hasn't.

01:40:35.440 --> 01:40:38.319
Mary Poppins isn't real.

01:40:38.320 --> 01:40:39.959
That's not true. No, no, no.

01:40:39.960 --> 01:40:42.959
She's as real as can
be to my daughters.

01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:45.288
And to thousands
of other kids. Adults, too.

01:40:45.600 --> 01:40:49.843
She's been there as a nighttime
comfort to a heck of a lot of people.

01:40:50.680 --> 01:40:53.519
Well, where is she
when I need her, hmm?

01:40:53.520 --> 01:40:55.039
I open the door to Mary Poppins,

01:40:55.040 --> 01:40:59.450
and who should be standing there,
but Walt Disney?

01:41:01.760 --> 01:41:03.849
Mrs. Travers, I'm sorry.

01:41:04.280 --> 01:41:08.159
I'd hoped this would have been
a magical experience,

01:41:08.160 --> 01:41:11.719
for you and for all of us,
but I've let you down.

01:41:11.720 --> 01:41:12.999
And, in doing so,

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:16.211
I've broken a 20-year-old
promise I made to my daughters.

01:41:16.760 --> 01:41:20.519
I've been racking my brain,
trying to figure out why

01:41:20.520 --> 01:41:23.883
this has been so
hard for you and I.

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.009
And, well...

01:41:29.400 --> 01:41:34.447
You see,
I have my own Mr. Banks.

01:41:36.080 --> 01:41:38.039
Mine had a mustache.

01:41:38.040 --> 01:41:42.404
So, it is not true that Disney
created man in his own image?

01:41:42.880 --> 01:41:44.799
No, no.

01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:47.279
But it is true that
you created yourself

01:41:47.280 --> 01:41:49.130
in someone else's, yes?

01:41:51.360 --> 01:41:53.679
Have you ever been
to Kansas City, Mrs. Travers?

01:41:53.680 --> 01:41:55.405
Do you know Missouri at all?

01:41:56.120 --> 01:41:57.639
I can't say I do.

01:41:57.640 --> 01:41:59.879
Well, it's mighty cold
there in the winters.

01:41:59.880 --> 01:42:01.519
Bitter cold.

01:42:01.520 --> 01:42:03.559
And my dad, Elias Disney,

01:42:03.560 --> 01:42:05.759
he owned a newspaper
delivery route there.

01:42:05.760 --> 01:42:08.119
A thousand papers, twice daily.

01:42:08.120 --> 01:42:10.607
A morning and an evening edition.

01:42:10.840 --> 01:42:12.959
And Dad was a tough businessman.

01:42:12.960 --> 01:42:16.639
He was a "save a penny
any way you can" type of fella.

01:42:16.640 --> 01:42:19.759
So he wouldn't employ
delivery boys.

01:42:19.760 --> 01:42:24.090
No, no, no. He used me
and my big brother Roy.

01:42:24.640 --> 01:42:28.119
I was, uh...
I was eight back then.

01:42:28.120 --> 01:42:29.765
Just eight years old.

01:42:30.480 --> 01:42:34.002
And, like I said,
winters are harsh.

01:42:34.400 --> 01:42:36.759
And old Elias, well,
he didn't believe in new shoes,

01:42:36.760 --> 01:42:39.439
until the old ones
were worn through.

01:42:39.440 --> 01:42:40.959
Honestly, Mrs. Travers,

01:42:40.960 --> 01:42:43.559
the snowdrifts, sometimes they
were up over my head.

01:42:43.560 --> 01:42:46.570
And we'd push through that
snow like it was molasses.

01:42:47.760 --> 01:42:49.719
The cold and wet seeping through

01:42:49.720 --> 01:42:52.127
our clothes and our shoes.

01:42:52.920 --> 01:42:55.159
Skin peeling from our faces.

01:42:55.160 --> 01:42:58.879
Sometimes I'd find myself
sunk down in that snow,

01:42:58.880 --> 01:43:00.079
just waking up,

01:43:00.080 --> 01:43:02.567
because I must have passed out
or something, I don't know.

01:43:03.560 --> 01:43:05.439
And then it was time for school,

01:43:05.440 --> 01:43:07.079
and I was too cold or wet

01:43:07.080 --> 01:43:10.039
to figure out equations and things.

01:43:10.040 --> 01:43:11.999
And then it was right back
out in the snow again

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:13.804
to get home just before dark.

01:43:14.440 --> 01:43:17.479
Mother would feed us dinner.

01:43:17.480 --> 01:43:19.599
And then it was time
to go right back out

01:43:19.600 --> 01:43:22.531
and do it again for
the evening edition.

01:43:24.880 --> 01:43:28.599
"You had best be quick there, Walt."
"You'd better get those newspapers up

01:43:28.600 --> 01:43:31.119
"on that porch
and under that storm door.

01:43:31.120 --> 01:43:33.039
"Poppa's gonna lose
his temper again

01:43:33.040 --> 01:43:36.403
"and show you the buckle
end of his belt, boy."

01:43:41.440 --> 01:43:43.999
I don't... I don't tell you this
to make you sad,

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:45.279
Mrs. Travers.

01:43:45.280 --> 01:43:47.879
I don't. I love my life.
I think it's a miracle.

01:43:47.880 --> 01:43:51.959
And I loved my dad. He was a...
He was a wonderful man.

01:43:51.960 --> 01:43:54.559
But rare is the day

01:43:54.560 --> 01:43:58.239
when I don't think about
that eight-year-old boy

01:43:58.240 --> 01:44:01.599
delivering newspapers in the snow,

01:44:01.600 --> 01:44:05.691
and old Elias Disney
with that strap in his fist.

01:44:06.280 --> 01:44:07.845
And I am just so tired.

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:10.531
Mrs. Travers,

01:44:10.960 --> 01:44:15.609
I'm tired of remembering
it that way.

01:44:16.040 --> 01:44:19.559
Aren't you tired, too,
Mrs. Travers?

01:44:19.560 --> 01:44:21.439
Now we all have our sad tales,

01:44:21.440 --> 01:44:25.439
but don't you want
to finish the story?

01:44:25.440 --> 01:44:26.919
Let it all go and have a life

01:44:26.920 --> 01:44:30.169
that isn't dictated by the past?

01:44:33.760 --> 01:44:37.879
It's not the children
she comes to save.

01:44:37.880 --> 01:44:39.445
It's their father.

01:44:42.880 --> 01:44:44.241
It's your father.

01:44:46.320 --> 01:44:47.851
Travers Goff.

01:44:54.040 --> 01:44:56.959
I don't know what you think
you know about me, Walter...

01:44:56.960 --> 01:45:00.919
You must have loved and admired
him a lot to take his name.

01:45:00.920 --> 01:45:01.999
I...

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:03.959
It's him this is all about,
isn't it?

01:45:03.960 --> 01:45:05.889
All of it, everything.

01:45:09.240 --> 01:45:12.279
Forgiveness, Mrs. Travers.

01:45:12.280 --> 01:45:14.919
It's what I learned
from your books.

01:45:14.920 --> 01:45:16.839
I don't have to forgive my father.

01:45:16.840 --> 01:45:18.399
He was a wonderful man.

01:45:18.400 --> 01:45:20.284
No, no.

01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:22.409
You need to forgive Helen Goff.

01:45:24.520 --> 01:45:28.805
Life is a harsh sentence
to lay down for yourself.

01:45:32.160 --> 01:45:34.319
Give her to me.

01:45:34.320 --> 01:45:39.367
Mrs. Travers, trust me with
your precious Mary Poppins.

01:45:40.520 --> 01:45:42.722
I won't disappoint you.

01:45:43.200 --> 01:45:46.439
I swear, every time a person
walks into a movie house,

01:45:46.440 --> 01:45:49.119
from Leicester Square
to Kansas City,

01:45:49.120 --> 01:45:52.085
they will see George
Banks being saved.

01:45:52.720 --> 01:45:54.919
They will love him and his kids.

01:45:54.920 --> 01:45:57.885
They will weep for his cares.

01:45:58.120 --> 01:46:01.767
They will wring their hands
when he loses his job.

01:46:03.080 --> 01:46:05.806
And when he flies that kite...

01:46:07.520 --> 01:46:09.563
Oh, Mrs. Travers,
they will rejoice.

01:46:10.680 --> 01:46:12.530
They will sing.

01:46:13.240 --> 01:46:17.519
In movie houses all over the world, in the
eyes and hearts of my kids and other kids,

01:46:17.520 --> 01:46:20.371
and mothers and fathers
for generations to come,

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:24.568
George Banks will be honored.

01:46:24.960 --> 01:46:27.447
George Banks will be redeemed.

01:46:27.480 --> 01:46:31.207
George Banks and all he stands for
will be saved.

01:46:31.960 --> 01:46:36.370
Now, maybe not in life,
but in imagination.

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.680
Because that's what
we storytellers do.

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.359
We restore order with imagination.

01:46:42.360 --> 01:46:46.770
We instill hope again
and again and again.

01:46:49.720 --> 01:46:52.439
So, trust me, Mrs. Travers.

01:46:52.440 --> 01:46:54.449
Let me prove it to you.

01:46:55.320 --> 01:46:57.841
I give you my word.

01:47:14.520 --> 01:47:16.051
Enough.

01:47:38.720 --> 01:47:40.159
Just make those two changes

01:47:40.160 --> 01:47:42.601
and I'm sure everything
will be just fine. Just fine.

01:47:43.360 --> 01:47:44.639
Walt, could I get
your approval on that, please?

01:47:44.640 --> 01:47:45.799
What is it?

01:47:45.800 --> 01:47:47.639
Invitation list to the premiere.

01:47:47.640 --> 01:47:49.759
Yeah? Is this everyone?

01:47:49.760 --> 01:47:51.689
It's not everyone.

01:47:54.920 --> 01:47:57.279
Now, there will be a
premiere in London.

01:47:57.280 --> 01:47:59.721
That will be more
convenient for her.

01:47:59.920 --> 01:48:04.359
Tommie, this wasn't an easy decision
for me, but you know what she's like.

01:48:04.360 --> 01:48:06.879
We got press,
interviews, cameras.

01:48:06.880 --> 01:48:10.562
I need to protect the picture.

01:48:10.920 --> 01:48:12.804
Okay.

01:48:17.400 --> 01:48:19.045
Ah.

01:48:19.840 --> 01:48:22.042
I should say so, too.

01:48:23.200 --> 01:48:25.243
Mrs. Travers!

01:48:31.080 --> 01:48:32.399
Mrs. Travers!

01:48:32.400 --> 01:48:35.319
Will you stop screeching
like an alley cat!

01:48:35.320 --> 01:48:37.602
And answer the door!

01:48:38.240 --> 01:48:40.399
I'm very pleased to
hear that, Pamela.

01:48:40.400 --> 01:48:42.839
I should think you will
have a draft fairly soon.

01:48:42.840 --> 01:48:44.359
Polly, where's that tea?

01:48:44.360 --> 01:48:46.079
It's coming along marvelously.

01:48:46.080 --> 01:48:47.239
Ah, ah, ah.

01:48:47.240 --> 01:48:48.851
No peeking.

01:48:50.800 --> 01:48:52.599
Aren't you going to pour it for us?

01:48:52.600 --> 01:48:55.610
You're perfectly capable
of pouring it yourself.

01:48:57.760 --> 01:49:00.119
She's quite the worst
maid I've ever had.

01:49:00.120 --> 01:49:01.679
- So why do you keep her?
- I don't know.

01:49:01.680 --> 01:49:03.644
She reminds me of me.

01:49:05.440 --> 01:49:06.641
Do you have a title?

01:49:06.760 --> 01:49:08.962
<i>Mary Poppins in the Kitchen.</i>

01:49:09.040 --> 01:49:10.446
Wonderful.

01:49:10.720 --> 01:49:14.561
So, should we start talking
about the film rights?

01:49:14.640 --> 01:49:15.879
Never again.

01:49:15.880 --> 01:49:17.320
Okay.

01:49:18.920 --> 01:49:21.566
Now, tell me, have you got
your tiara for the premiere?

01:49:21.840 --> 01:49:23.519
Oh, I'm not going to that.

01:49:23.520 --> 01:49:24.919
Why not?

01:49:24.920 --> 01:49:27.726
Hollywood premieres aren't
for an old trout like me.

01:49:28.200 --> 01:49:32.007
Anyway, it's not convenient.

01:49:32.280 --> 01:49:34.482
He hasn't invited you, has he?

01:49:37.600 --> 01:49:41.247
Mary Poppins wouldn't
stand for that.

01:49:46.520 --> 01:49:47.719
Can I help you?

01:49:47.720 --> 01:49:49.251
I'm perfectly capable, thank you.

01:49:49.600 --> 01:49:51.450
As I recall.

01:49:53.520 --> 01:49:55.245
Sweet of you.

01:49:59.400 --> 01:50:01.568
- Walt... Um...
- Hello, Dolly!

01:50:01.800 --> 01:50:02.839
Walt...

01:50:02.840 --> 01:50:06.761
Tommie, we're gonna have
to move that meeting with GE.

01:50:08.280 --> 01:50:09.481
What?

01:50:17.160 --> 01:50:18.639
Mrs. Travers.

01:50:18.640 --> 01:50:19.919
Me again!

01:50:19.920 --> 01:50:22.359
How wonderful to see you.

01:50:22.360 --> 01:50:24.403
I'm here for my premiere.

01:50:25.560 --> 01:50:26.719
Great!

01:50:26.720 --> 01:50:28.399
I didn't receive my invitation,

01:50:28.400 --> 01:50:31.039
but I just assumed the
American postal service

01:50:31.040 --> 01:50:34.084
had fallen down upon the job,
as per usual.

01:50:34.280 --> 01:50:37.927
I will have a replacement
sent to your hotel right away.

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:39.679
You're very kind, Mr. Disney.

01:50:39.680 --> 01:50:42.281
I knew you wouldn't
have forgotten me.

01:50:43.720 --> 01:50:45.206
Pamela.

01:50:45.600 --> 01:50:48.770
How could I forget you?

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:55.719
- Good evening.
- Oh, hello.

01:50:55.720 --> 01:50:57.319
Could you please order me a cab?

01:50:57.320 --> 01:50:58.567
Absolutely.

01:51:16.920 --> 01:51:18.121
Ralph?

01:51:18.600 --> 01:51:20.399
I had a feeling a certain
friend of mine

01:51:20.400 --> 01:51:22.204
might be needing me tonight.

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:27.079
Oh.

01:51:27.080 --> 01:51:30.204
Hey!
Wow.

01:51:31.440 --> 01:51:33.449
You look like a million bucks.

01:51:33.760 --> 01:51:35.644
Thank you.

01:51:35.960 --> 01:51:38.279
Let's get you to that ball.
Huh? Come on.

01:51:38.280 --> 01:51:39.720
Thank you, Ralph. Thank you.

01:52:14.480 --> 01:52:16.842
Oh, no, no, no.
I got that, brother.

01:52:26.960 --> 01:52:28.969
This is your night.

01:52:29.480 --> 01:52:33.207
None of this would be
possible without you.

01:54:15.240 --> 01:54:17.124
<i>And snap!</i>

01:54:17.240 --> 01:54:19.204
<i>The job is a game.</i>

01:54:19.560 --> 01:54:22.079
<i>And every task you undertake</i>

01:54:22.080 --> 01:54:24.439
<i>Becomes a piece of cake</i>

01:54:24.440 --> 01:54:29.646
<i>A lark, a spree
It's very clear to see</i>

01:54:50.120 --> 01:54:51.919
<i>Step in time, step in time</i>

01:54:51.920 --> 01:54:53.319
<i>Step in time, step in time</i>

01:54:53.320 --> 01:54:54.799
<i>Never need a reason
Never need a rhyme</i>

01:54:54.800 --> 01:54:58.368
<i>Step in time
You step in time</i>

01:54:58.440 --> 01:55:01.799
<i>Sometimes, a person we love,
through no fault of his own,</i>

01:55:01.800 --> 01:55:04.446
<i>can't see past the end of his nose.</i>

01:55:04.560 --> 01:55:06.319
<i>Past the end of his nose?</i>

01:55:06.320 --> 01:55:09.159
<i>Well, now,
there must be some mistake.</i>

01:55:09.160 --> 01:55:11.522
<i>Your dad is a fine gentleman,
and he loves you.</i>

01:55:11.720 --> 01:55:13.159
<i>I don't think so.</i>

01:55:13.160 --> 01:55:15.559
<i>You should have seen
the look on his face.</i>

01:55:15.560 --> 01:55:18.161
<i>He doesn't like us at all.</i>

01:55:18.320 --> 01:55:20.839
<i>Well, now, that don't
seem likely, does it?</i>

01:55:20.840 --> 01:55:22.451
<i>Let's sit down.</i>

01:55:22.840 --> 01:55:25.599
<i>You know, begging your pardon,</i>

01:55:25.600 --> 01:55:28.724
<i>but the one my heart
goes out to is your father.</i>

01:55:28.840 --> 01:55:32.999
<i>There he is in that cold,
heartless bank, day after day.</i>

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:36.682
<i>Hemmed in by mounds
of cold, heartless money.</i>

01:55:36.840 --> 01:55:39.599
<i>I don't like to see
any living thing caged up.</i>

01:55:39.600 --> 01:55:41.519
<i>Father in a cage?</i>

01:55:41.520 --> 01:55:44.599
<i>They makes cages in
all sizes and shapes, you know.</i>

01:55:44.600 --> 01:55:47.159
<i>Bank-shaped some of them,
carpets and all.</i>

01:55:47.160 --> 01:55:49.886
<i>Mary Poppins,
you won't ever leave us, will you?</i>

01:55:50.360 --> 01:55:53.279
<i>Whatever would we
do without you?</i>

01:55:53.280 --> 01:55:56.245
<i>I shall stay
until the wind changes.</i>

01:56:30.680 --> 01:56:34.239
It's all right.
It's all right, Mrs. Travers.

01:56:34.240 --> 01:56:37.887
Mr. Banks is going
to be all right, I promise.

01:56:38.040 --> 01:56:39.685
No, no. It's just...

01:56:40.320 --> 01:56:43.410
I can't abide cartoons.

01:56:47.400 --> 01:56:48.806
Mmm.

01:56:49.560 --> 01:56:51.239
Oh, oh, oh!

01:56:51.240 --> 01:56:54.879
<i>Let's go fly a kite</i>

01:56:54.880 --> 01:56:58.439
<i>Up to the highest height</i>

01:56:58.440 --> 01:57:01.759
<i>Let's go fly a kite</i>

01:57:01.760 --> 01:57:05.719
<i>And send it soaring</i>

01:57:07.360 --> 01:57:09.079
<i>Up through the atmosphere</i>

01:57:09.080 --> 01:57:12.599
<i>Up where the air is clear</i>

01:57:12.600 --> 01:57:16.441
<i>Oh, let's go...</i>

01:57:39.920 --> 01:57:41.690
Don't leave me.

01:57:43.640 --> 01:57:45.330
Never.

01:57:46.120 --> 01:57:48.163
I promise.

01:57:48.640 --> 01:57:50.729
I will never leave you.

01:58:02.160 --> 01:58:04.328
<i>Wind's in the east,</i>

01:58:04.680 --> 01:58:06.848
<i>mist coming in,</i>

01:58:07.120 --> 01:58:09.607
<i>like something is brewing,</i>

01:58:09.920 --> 01:58:12.521
<i>about to begin.</i>

01:58:13.080 --> 01:58:15.362
<i>Can't put my finger</i>

01:58:15.600 --> 01:58:18.167
<i>on what lies in store,</i>

01:58:18.480 --> 01:58:21.359
<i>but I feel what's to happen</i>

01:58:21.360 --> 01:58:25.485
<i>all happened before.</i>

02:00:45.280 --> 02:00:48.479
<i>Now, who's reading?
And go slowly.</i>

02:00:48.480 --> 02:00:49.999
<i>You start and I'll take over...</i>

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:51.679
<i>"Autumn. In the early part</i>

02:00:51.680 --> 02:00:54.159
<i>"of the 20th century, 1910. London.</i>

02:00:54.160 --> 02:00:56.319
<i>"At Number 17 Cherry Tree Lane,</i>

02:00:56.320 --> 02:00:57.919
<i>"the Banks household is in an uproar."</i>

02:00:57.920 --> 02:00:58.999
Hold if.

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.239
<i>Now, I see that Cherry Tree Lane</i>

02:01:01.240 --> 02:01:06.048
<i>as not too townified
on one side of the park.</i>

02:01:06.360 --> 02:01:09.679
<i>And we'll get you a photograph
of 50 Smith Street,</i>

02:01:09.680 --> 02:01:14.439
<i>in order to see that the house
is really quite like that.</i>

02:01:14.440 --> 02:01:17.119
<i>But it has more of a garden
than my house had.</i>

02:01:17.120 --> 02:01:19.119
<i>But it might be useful and amusing</i>

02:01:19.120 --> 02:01:21.322
<i>to put it in as my house.
You see?</i>

02:01:23.040 --> 02:01:25.039
<i>"Upstairs in the nursery,</i>

02:01:25.040 --> 02:01:27.119
<i>"where Mary is measuring up
the children</i>

02:01:27.120 --> 02:01:29.439
<i>"with a long row of tape measure,</i>

02:01:29.440 --> 02:01:32.039
<i>"Mary reads off the tape that Jane is..."</i>

02:01:32.040 --> 02:01:33.119
<i>First she says,</i>

02:01:33.120 --> 02:01:34.719
<i>"What kind of material
have we got to work with?"</i>

02:01:34.720 --> 02:01:36.719
<i>No, no.
That, we cannot have.</i>

02:01:36.720 --> 02:01:38.719
<i>That would be quite un-English.</i>

02:01:38.720 --> 02:01:41.039
<i>Mrs. Travers, basically,
what we want to do here</i>

02:01:41.040 --> 02:01:43.199
<i>is use pretty much
what you have in the book.</i>

02:01:43.200 --> 02:01:44.399
<i>Yes, yes.</i>

02:01:44.400 --> 02:01:46.959
<i>Now, I want this tape measure
to be used,</i>

02:01:46.960 --> 02:01:49.399
<i>because it was a tape measure
that my mother had</i>

02:01:49.400 --> 02:01:51.239
<i>- when she was a little girl.
Mmm-hmm.</i>

02:01:51.240 --> 02:01:53.602
<i>And I think
it would be very nice.</i>

02:01:54.160 --> 02:01:55.639
<i>"At the end of the chorus..."</i>

02:01:55.640 --> 02:01:56.879
<i>Read me all that, now.</i>

02:01:56.880 --> 02:01:58.559
<i>- We were going to.
- Read it.</i>

02:01:58.560 --> 02:02:00.079
<i>No, no. You read it.</i>

02:02:00.080 --> 02:02:02.479
<i>Do you want to bear us?</i>

02:02:02.480 --> 02:02:04.039
No. Go on.

02:02:04.040 --> 02:02:05.239
<i>This is torture!</i>

02:02:05.240 --> 02:02:08.639
<i>Now, go on.
"At the end of the chorus..."</i>

02:02:08.640 --> 02:02:10.319
<i>There ought perhaps to have</i>

02:02:10.320 --> 02:02:12.319
<i>been people in this countryside.</i>

02:02:12.320 --> 02:02:14.399
<i>Do you see?
Are you making note of it?</i>

02:02:14.400 --> 02:02:16.839
<i>And they would be the Pearly people.</i>

02:02:16.840 --> 02:02:19.239
<i>They'd be arriving
and they'd come nearer</i>

02:02:19.240 --> 02:02:21.359
<i>and they'd see, "Ah. Hmm."</i>

02:02:21.360 --> 02:02:24.919
<i>They know they are
not grand enough to eat at this table.</i>

02:02:24.920 --> 02:02:26.759
<i>- Have you got this on tape?
- Yes. Oh, yes.</i>

02:02:26.760 --> 02:02:28.599
<i>Because
I think it's important.</i>

02:02:28.600 --> 02:02:32.282
<i>I'm not going to do this film
unless I'm available for it.</i>

02:02:32.440 --> 02:02:34.599
<i>There are these tapes also,
you know.</i>

02:02:34.600 --> 02:02:36.279
<i>No, it's not enough.</i>

02:02:36.280 --> 02:02:39.279
<i>We, uh... We have
to feel the impact of it.</i>

02:02:39.280 --> 02:02:40.399
<i>Yes, yes.</i>

02:02:40.400 --> 02:02:42.119
<i>Well, anyway, it brings
about whatever it is,</i>

02:02:42.120 --> 02:02:45.119
<i>Mr. Banks, um, is able.</i>

02:02:45.120 --> 02:02:48.759
<i>He has a tender, good heart.
Not a change of heart.</i>

02:02:48.760 --> 02:02:51.119
<i>Because he's always been sweet,</i>

02:02:51.120 --> 02:02:53.926
<i>but worried with the cares of life.</i>

02:02:54.305 --> 02:03:00.243
