00:09.303 --> 00:10.787
Hello?

00:10.789 --> 00:13.056
LINDA:
In the kitchen.

00:13.974 --> 00:16.209
Something smells good.
What are you cooking?

00:16.210 --> 00:18.728
Duck.
Duck?

00:18.730 --> 00:20.730
Mm-hmm, duck.

00:20.732 --> 00:23.399
Do the boys like duck?

00:23.401 --> 00:25.902
The boys aren't home.
Mm.

00:25.904 --> 00:27.187
They're at a sleepover.

00:27.189 --> 00:28.822
Mm. Then I guess

00:28.824 --> 00:31.324
it's just you
and me and the duck.

00:31.326 --> 00:33.576
Yup.
That sounds delicious.

00:33.578 --> 00:34.894
(laughs)

00:34.896 --> 00:36.112
Hmm.

00:36.114 --> 00:38.698
You want to open
some wine for us?

00:38.700 --> 00:40.366
Mm-hmm, okay.

00:40.368 --> 00:43.002
(phone ringing)

00:43.004 --> 00:44.787
Sorry.

00:44.789 --> 00:46.756
Gormley?

00:46.758 --> 00:48.791
No.

00:48.793 --> 00:50.877
Marianne Romano.

00:50.879 --> 00:52.773
You are not going over
there to kill a spider.

00:52.798 --> 00:53.931
I know. I know.

00:53.932 --> 00:55.298
Hello.
MARIANNE: Danny?! Danny! Danny?!

00:55.300 --> 00:57.550
What is it?
MAN: Hang it up, you stupid bitch!

00:57.552 --> 00:58.918
Marianne, who is that?
MAN: You hear me.

00:58.920 --> 01:00.220
MARIANNE:
Danny, he's gone insane!

01:00.222 --> 01:01.387
Who's gone insane?

01:01.389 --> 01:03.389
What? Will you calm down?
MARIANNE: Danny! No!

01:03.391 --> 01:04.757
Hello?
(beep)

01:04.759 --> 01:07.560
Sounds like some guy's
over there beating on her.

01:07.562 --> 01:10.280
Yeah, or she just turned up
the volume on <i>Maury Povich.</i>

01:10.282 --> 01:11.764
You know I got to go.

01:11.766 --> 01:13.316
Hurry back, okay?

01:13.318 --> 01:15.985
I will. Mmm.

01:25.996 --> 01:27.380
All right, tied up at seven.

01:27.382 --> 01:28.781
But not for long, though.

01:28.783 --> 01:30.800
All right, bring it.
Shake it up.

01:30.802 --> 01:31.918
You're gonna give me the shot?

01:31.920 --> 01:33.953
So, take it if you
got it, big boy.

01:33.955 --> 01:36.289
(sighs)
That's the game.

01:36.291 --> 01:38.508
It's luck.

01:39.743 --> 01:42.645
Hey, gym's booked right now.

01:42.647 --> 01:45.315
I come to see
my boy Tomas.

01:45.317 --> 01:47.100
What's up, J?

01:47.102 --> 01:49.102
What's up with you?

01:49.104 --> 01:50.436
Just playing some ball.

01:50.438 --> 01:52.105
You could play
ball with us.

01:52.107 --> 01:54.107
Hey, Jonny, Ricky, this court's
booked for guys who are

01:54.109 --> 01:56.576
signed up in the program, all
right, so, sign up, or get lost.

01:56.578 --> 01:59.412
Come on, back
to the game.

02:00.297 --> 02:01.548
I'll see you guys later.

02:01.550 --> 02:03.666
You come with me now, all right?

02:03.668 --> 02:05.301
That's an order.

02:05.303 --> 02:07.720
I said I'll see you later.

02:09.000 --> 02:15.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:20.133 --> 02:21.317
They have a beef with you

02:21.319 --> 02:22.769
because you're signed up
for the program,

02:22.771 --> 02:24.470
or 'cause you're not running
with them anymore?

02:24.472 --> 02:26.773
I guess you could say both.

02:26.775 --> 02:29.909
All right, come on,
let's play a new game, come on.

02:38.369 --> 02:41.588
Oh, Danny, thank you.

02:41.590 --> 02:43.756
Thank you, thank you
so much for coming.

02:43.758 --> 02:45.708
All right, settle down, okay?

02:45.710 --> 02:47.159
Come on.
Yeah.

02:47.161 --> 02:48.261
What happened?

02:48.263 --> 02:49.545
(sighs)

02:49.547 --> 02:52.432
He's just got real,
real bad mood swings.

02:52.434 --> 02:53.466
Who?

02:53.468 --> 02:54.934
Joe.

02:54.936 --> 02:58.354
Joe. This Joe-- did he hit you?

02:59.189 --> 03:01.641
He didn't mean to.

03:01.643 --> 03:03.059
He didn't mean to. Let me guess.

03:03.061 --> 03:04.811
He just threw a punch,
and you happened

03:04.813 --> 03:07.313
to walk by at that very moment?

03:07.315 --> 03:08.648
Where the hell is this guy?

03:08.650 --> 03:11.117
He's gone.
He won't be back tonight.

03:11.119 --> 03:12.852
Right. Who is he?

03:12.854 --> 03:16.022
It's Freight Train Joe Frye,
Danny-- the running back

03:16.024 --> 03:17.356
from the NFL?

03:17.358 --> 03:18.691
Yeah, I know who he is.

03:18.693 --> 03:20.209
Guy hasn't played ball
in years.

03:20.211 --> 03:22.378
And what is it with you
and broken-down ex-athletes?

03:22.380 --> 03:24.196
He's in great shape.
(sighs)

03:24.198 --> 03:26.365
You know, and he
loves me for me.

03:26.367 --> 03:27.634
Right.

03:27.636 --> 03:31.504
You know, we got engaged
in-in Cancun last week.

03:31.506 --> 03:33.222
See?

03:33.224 --> 03:34.424
That's very nice.

03:34.426 --> 03:36.476
Aren't you gonna
congratulate me?

03:36.478 --> 03:37.593
On, what, the engagement

03:37.595 --> 03:40.179
or this colorful bruise
the guy put on you?

03:40.181 --> 03:41.597
Come on, don't be jealous.

03:41.599 --> 03:43.483
Marianne, we dated
in high school.

03:43.485 --> 03:44.817
It was love, and you know it.

03:44.819 --> 03:46.385
Look, I promised your brother

03:46.387 --> 03:48.021
I'd look after you, all right?

03:48.023 --> 03:50.406
I didn't promise him
I would play referee

03:50.408 --> 03:52.408
for your love life.

03:52.410 --> 03:54.160
If this clown puts his hands
on you again,

03:54.162 --> 03:55.561
I'm gonna lock him up,
you understand?

03:55.563 --> 03:57.864
You look good, Danny.

03:57.866 --> 03:59.198
Good night, Marianne.

03:59.200 --> 04:00.833
Get inside.

04:03.570 --> 04:05.455
I'm parked on the corner.

04:05.457 --> 04:06.956
You want a ride home?

04:06.958 --> 04:09.509
It's only five blocks.

04:09.511 --> 04:11.577
All right, well, stay away
from Jonny and them, okay?

04:11.579 --> 04:14.764
How? We live in
the same place.

04:14.766 --> 04:16.916
I've known them since
I was, like, three.

04:16.918 --> 04:19.084
The whole point
of the JRIP program is

04:19.087 --> 04:21.087
to keep you out of the life
that he's headed for.

04:21.089 --> 04:22.421
Stay away.

04:22.423 --> 04:24.590
All right, okay.

04:24.592 --> 04:26.926
I'm serious, Tomas. If you're
on the fence about this,

04:26.928 --> 04:28.027
don't waste my time.

04:28.029 --> 04:30.029
Yeah, all right, all right.

04:32.149 --> 04:34.033
Ay-ay-ay.

04:34.035 --> 04:36.319
(sighs)
Hey.

04:36.321 --> 04:38.988
Hey. Marianne okay?

04:38.990 --> 04:40.823
Yeah, she's fine.

04:40.825 --> 04:42.542
Where-where you going?

04:42.544 --> 04:44.494
Terry called. Her little
one's running a 103,

04:44.496 --> 04:46.278
so I said I'd
cover her shift.

04:46.280 --> 04:47.714
Are you kidding me?

04:47.716 --> 04:49.462
What am I gonna do, Danny?
I owe her one, you know?

04:49.487 --> 04:50.801
Yeah.

04:50.802 --> 04:53.285
What was Marianne's problem?

04:53.287 --> 04:54.754
She got engaged.

04:54.756 --> 04:55.722
That's a problem?

04:55.724 --> 04:57.006
He hits her.

04:57.008 --> 04:58.057
That's your problem?

04:58.059 --> 04:59.342
Come on. I made a promise.

04:59.344 --> 05:00.510
What do you want me to do?

05:00.512 --> 05:02.311
Tell her there's this thing
called 911.

05:02.313 --> 05:03.963
I know. I know!

05:03.965 --> 05:05.631
Look, Danny, I know

05:05.633 --> 05:08.151
that you swore to her brother
that you'd look after her,

05:08.153 --> 05:10.737
and I'm sorry he's not
around, but there's...

05:10.739 --> 05:12.488
I mean, come on.
There's got to be some kind

05:12.490 --> 05:13.823
of statute of limitations

05:13.825 --> 05:15.825
on these old neighborhood
six-beers oaths.

05:15.827 --> 05:18.444
You think I enjoy
playing her white knight?

05:19.329 --> 05:21.914
I got to go.

05:22.750 --> 05:24.834
I smell perfume.

05:24.836 --> 05:26.035
I...

05:26.037 --> 05:27.503
(sniffing)
Ambush.

05:27.505 --> 05:29.172
She was upset when I got there,

05:29.174 --> 05:31.090
she hugged me, that's it.

05:31.959 --> 05:33.176
Come on!

05:33.178 --> 05:34.293
I can't believe

05:34.295 --> 05:36.179
she still wears Ambush,
you know?

05:36.181 --> 05:38.214
It's probably the single
longest commitment of her life.

05:38.216 --> 05:39.432
You're probably right.

05:39.434 --> 05:40.850
I'll see you in the morning.

05:40.852 --> 05:43.136
All right. I'll make you
a romantic breakfast.

05:43.138 --> 05:45.337
Yeah, nothing like
eight hours on her feet

05:45.339 --> 05:47.890
and a piece of toast
to get a girl going.

05:48.675 --> 05:51.277
(car door closes,
engine starts)

05:51.279 --> 05:53.512
(horns honking
in the distance)

05:54.347 --> 05:56.515
(car alarm chirps off)

06:04.658 --> 06:06.692
(car engine starts)

06:10.197 --> 06:12.215
(groans)

06:14.718 --> 06:17.220
(panting)

06:19.723 --> 06:21.641
(groans)

06:21.643 --> 06:23.176
(tires squealing)

06:23.178 --> 06:25.144
(groaning)

06:25.929 --> 06:28.347
(groans)

06:29.183 --> 06:31.684
Hey, police!

06:32.436 --> 06:34.153
Oh.
JAMIE: Stop right there!

06:34.155 --> 06:37.690
Police officer!
(panting)

06:37.692 --> 06:40.193
Hey. Police.

06:40.195 --> 06:43.362
(panting)

06:44.248 --> 06:45.615
(panting)

06:46.450 --> 06:49.418
(panting continues)

06:50.787 --> 06:52.455
(horn honking, groans)

06:52.457 --> 06:54.907
(indistinct shouting,
tires squealing)

06:59.630 --> 07:02.014
(distant shouting)

07:03.583 --> 07:04.800
(phone ringing through)

07:04.802 --> 07:06.219
I'm an off-duty

07:06.221 --> 07:09.388
police officer,
shield number 60528.

07:09.390 --> 07:10.439
I need a bus forthwith,

07:10.441 --> 07:12.024
corner of Avenue P
and East 35th Street.

07:12.026 --> 07:14.277
Male struck by a vehicle.

07:14.279 --> 07:16.946
Central, put a rush on it.
He's not responsive.

07:16.948 --> 07:19.232
Okay.
Oh, my God.

07:19.234 --> 07:21.033
You did this, man.

07:21.035 --> 07:23.319
This is on you, man.

07:23.321 --> 07:25.705
This is on you.

07:25.707 --> 07:27.123
(sighs)

07:32.246 --> 07:34.997
(panting)

07:40.988 --> 07:43.388
Early indication is
that the boy may be paralyzed

07:43.389 --> 07:45.055
from the waist down.

07:45.777 --> 07:47.010
I'm sorry to hear that.

07:47.011 --> 07:49.378
Officer Reagan's PBA rep
showed up in a flash.

07:49.380 --> 07:51.647
They took his statement,
he acted appropriately.

07:51.649 --> 07:53.949
And why would I think otherwise?

07:53.951 --> 07:55.417
I just thought
you'd like to know.

07:55.419 --> 07:57.920
Are you going to give me a
retail account of every officer

07:57.922 --> 07:59.672
who happened to get
into a jam yesterday?

07:59.674 --> 08:01.840
It's your son.
Exactly, who I raised

08:01.842 --> 08:03.575
to take care
of his own business.

08:03.577 --> 08:05.544
There are conflicting reports
as to whether

08:05.546 --> 08:08.347
Officer Reagan identified
himself as a police officer.

08:08.349 --> 08:11.634
The gangbanger said he didn't,
the kid in the Juvenile Robbery

08:11.636 --> 08:14.803
Intervention Program says
he clearly did.

08:14.805 --> 08:16.805
Garrett, I will not use
my influence

08:16.807 --> 08:18.440
to get my kids
special advantage!

08:18.442 --> 08:20.411
The kids involved are from
the Bitterman houses...

08:20.436 --> 08:20.927
Please!

08:20.928 --> 08:23.112
...where Vinny Cruz was killed.
Why do you do this?!

08:23.114 --> 08:24.897
Because there are two Reagans
on the job,

08:24.899 --> 08:26.899
and I feel
it's my duty to make sure

08:26.901 --> 08:28.867
you know when they're involved
in job-related conflict.

08:28.869 --> 08:32.571
It is not because
I expect you to intervene!

08:34.440 --> 08:37.208
Oh.

08:39.062 --> 08:42.381
So, you think
it looks like payback,

08:42.383 --> 08:44.717
Jamie getting even
for his partner?

08:44.719 --> 08:45.951
On the street, it sure does.

08:45.953 --> 08:47.252
And to the DA's office?

08:47.254 --> 08:48.337
No appetite for this.

08:48.339 --> 08:49.955
Okay, let's move on.

08:49.957 --> 08:51.957
Okay.

08:51.959 --> 08:53.759
Officer Reagan aside,

08:53.761 --> 08:56.228
your JRIP program's going
to come under heavy fire.

08:56.230 --> 08:57.963
Even I can make the case

08:57.965 --> 08:59.898
that the kids are being put
in danger of retaliation

08:59.900 --> 09:01.433
from the crews
they used to run with.

09:01.435 --> 09:03.102
I don't need you
to make the case.

09:03.104 --> 09:04.236
There's gonna be a long line,

09:04.238 --> 09:06.021
starting with
the inspector general.

09:06.023 --> 09:08.824
Who called me at 6:30 this
morning to get on your schedule.

09:08.826 --> 09:10.893
I'm releasing a
pre-emptive statement.

09:10.895 --> 09:13.996
"The Juvenile Robbery
Intervention Program fosters

09:13.998 --> 09:15.864
"mentor relationships
between police officers

09:15.866 --> 09:18.334
and kids
who are first-time offenders."

09:18.336 --> 09:20.285
It is an Upper West Side

09:20.287 --> 09:22.254
bleeding-heart liberal's  fe
dream

09:22.256 --> 09:23.405
of a program,
which is,

09:23.407 --> 09:26.291
anachronistically,
a pet project

09:26.293 --> 09:28.093
of the famously law-and-order

09:28.095 --> 09:30.179
and meat-and-potatoes
police commissioner.

09:30.181 --> 09:31.347
We can't say that.

09:31.349 --> 09:33.966
Well, find a way,
because it's true.

09:33.968 --> 09:36.769
And before you slot
the inspector general

09:36.771 --> 09:39.138
on my schedule,
take a look at that.

09:41.274 --> 09:44.226
"For your eyes only."

09:44.228 --> 09:48.230
From anonymous
at the Newark Police Department.

09:48.232 --> 09:49.882
Paper files?

09:49.884 --> 09:51.533
And photos from the mid-'90s

09:51.535 --> 09:53.852
when she was
Essex County prosecutor.

09:53.854 --> 09:56.155
Don't make copies
and check it out.

09:56.157 --> 09:57.456
For what?

09:57.458 --> 09:59.875
Accuracy and provenance.

09:59.877 --> 10:02.327
That's all?

10:03.196 --> 10:05.297
That's all for now.

10:08.001 --> 10:10.169
(sighs)

10:11.888 --> 10:14.173
(distant,
indistinct chatter)

10:25.151 --> 10:27.352
(indistinct chatter)

10:34.227 --> 10:36.745
Hey, could I help you
with something?

10:36.747 --> 10:38.847
Yeah, I'm looking for
Joe Frye. Is he around?

10:38.849 --> 10:40.749
Uh, if you want a autograph,
it's 20 bucks.

10:40.751 --> 10:42.234
No, I don't want
<i>a</i> autograph.

10:42.236 --> 10:43.836
I just need to
talk to him.

10:43.838 --> 10:45.204
I'm a friend of a friend.

10:45.206 --> 10:46.171
Oh, oh, right.

10:46.173 --> 10:48.357
Uh, let me
go tell him.

10:48.359 --> 10:49.407
Great.

10:49.409 --> 10:50.426
(man shouting)

10:50.428 --> 10:51.510
MAN:
How bad do you want it?!

10:51.512 --> 10:52.928
How bad do you want it?!

10:52.930 --> 10:54.596
You want to get on that field?!
Yeah.

10:54.598 --> 10:57.216
Let's go!
Give me three more!

10:57.218 --> 10:58.383
(speaking indistinctly)

10:59.585 --> 11:01.637
Geez.
Okay, yeah, give me a minute.

11:01.639 --> 11:03.922
Thanks, Ralph.

11:05.058 --> 11:06.475
He'll be right with you.
Okay.

11:06.477 --> 11:07.526
That guy on the bench--
he looks familiar.

11:07.528 --> 11:08.861
Who is that?

11:08.863 --> 11:09.812
Daquan Jackson.

11:09.814 --> 11:11.146
Plays for the Jets.

11:11.148 --> 11:12.397
Oh, yeah.

11:12.399 --> 11:14.116
Yeah, special teams
and backup running back,

11:14.118 --> 11:16.485
but you watch: he's gonna get
a lot more carries this year.

11:16.487 --> 11:17.736
What makes you say that?

11:17.738 --> 11:19.104
Freight Train training, baby.

11:19.106 --> 11:20.239
Joe Frye could turn
your mother

11:20.241 --> 11:21.439
into a brick wall.

11:21.441 --> 11:23.959
My mother is dead.

11:23.961 --> 11:26.161
Sorry, figure of speech.

11:26.163 --> 11:27.746
Hey. Joe Frye.
How you doing?

11:27.748 --> 11:28.881
How are you?
Danny Reagan.

11:28.883 --> 11:30.332
Right, the cop.

11:30.334 --> 11:31.834
No, the detective.

11:32.585 --> 11:34.619
Big strong hand
there, Joe.

11:34.621 --> 11:36.171
Sorry, hope I didn't hurt you.

11:36.173 --> 11:38.623
No, you didn't hurt me,
but you did bruise Marianne up

11:38.625 --> 11:40.225
pretty good, didn't you?

11:44.814 --> 11:46.899
That was a accident.

11:46.901 --> 11:48.433
We made up.

11:49.519 --> 11:52.271
Oh, I didn't know
it was <i>a</i> accident.

11:52.273 --> 11:54.439
Yeah, we had a spat.

11:55.408 --> 11:56.775
We worked it out.

11:56.777 --> 11:57.910
You mean you hit her.

11:57.912 --> 11:59.495
That's what you call
working it out?

11:59.497 --> 12:01.864
You on duty here, Detective?

12:01.866 --> 12:03.448
No, I'm not on duty,

12:03.450 --> 12:05.033
but if you put
your hands

12:05.035 --> 12:06.368
on her again,

12:06.370 --> 12:07.786
I'm gonna come back
here and I will be

12:07.788 --> 12:10.655
on duty, and that's gonna
be a problem for you, Joe.

12:10.657 --> 12:12.424
Okay, I won't.

12:12.426 --> 12:14.176
You know, not for nothing,
that's really not the way

12:14.178 --> 12:17.329
to treat a woman, especially
when you're gonna marry her.

12:17.331 --> 12:20.265
You got a thing for her?

12:20.267 --> 12:23.769
Don't make it
a problem for me.

12:23.771 --> 12:25.354
What'd you say?

12:27.190 --> 12:31.109
This isn't high school
anymore, all right,

12:31.111 --> 12:32.945
where you're over
hanging with her brother,

12:32.947 --> 12:35.280
going through her underwear
drawer when nobody's looking,

12:35.282 --> 12:37.983
dreaming you were her man.

12:37.985 --> 12:40.452
That the 'roids talking, Joe,
or all those concussions?

12:40.454 --> 12:42.854
I'm me.
Uh-huh.

12:42.856 --> 12:44.790
She's mine.

12:44.792 --> 12:46.158
Hmm.

12:46.160 --> 12:48.327
You're still just you.

12:50.330 --> 12:52.915
No argument here.

12:52.917 --> 12:55.751
Hey.

12:55.753 --> 12:58.203
You have the day off,
take the day off.

12:58.205 --> 13:00.372
Yeah, I am. Need you
to do me a favor, though.

13:00.374 --> 13:02.090
I want you
to call around

13:02.092 --> 13:03.625
and find out what unit's sitting

13:03.627 --> 13:06.311
on Joe Frye's gym
in Bay Ridge, okay?

13:06.313 --> 13:07.412
Who's Joe Frye?

13:07.414 --> 13:08.847
He's an ex-NFL running back.

13:08.849 --> 13:10.983
It's called
Joe Frye's Freight Train.

13:10.985 --> 13:12.851
This a case we caught?

13:12.853 --> 13:14.686
Well, it's a courtesy call
for now.

13:14.688 --> 13:16.021
Okay, will do.

13:16.023 --> 13:18.073
Thanks, partner.

13:20.660 --> 13:22.578
Hey, hey.

13:22.580 --> 13:24.529
Hey.

13:24.531 --> 13:26.331
What's up with the tie?

13:26.333 --> 13:28.000
Well, I have my interview
with Internal Affairs

13:28.002 --> 13:29.734
right after my deposition.

13:29.736 --> 13:32.371
Okay, well, I think you
might want to lose the tie.

13:32.373 --> 13:33.455
It makes you look
uncomfortable,

13:33.457 --> 13:36.541
and uncomfortable
reads squirrely.

13:36.543 --> 13:38.010
Well, I'm uncomfortable
with this whole thing.

13:38.012 --> 13:40.128
I mean, I clearly identified
myself as a cop,

13:40.130 --> 13:42.247
and both these kids knew
that I was a cop.

13:42.249 --> 13:44.016
I know, and the DA's
office has refused

13:44.018 --> 13:45.601
the case based on that.

13:45.603 --> 13:47.752
So what should I expect
from a civil suit?

13:47.754 --> 13:49.304
Well, the kids' families
and their lawyer

13:49.306 --> 13:51.306
are looking to
cash in on this.

13:51.308 --> 13:54.526
Yeah.

13:54.528 --> 13:56.478
Couple months.

13:56.480 --> 13:57.980
I think he'd say
that I'm making

13:57.982 --> 13:59.231
a difference in his life.

13:59.233 --> 14:00.232
Okay.

14:00.234 --> 14:03.318
Well, he said that
he was pretty sure

14:03.320 --> 14:06.788
you identified yourself as a
police officer when you chased

14:06.790 --> 14:08.624
Mr. Cisneros into the street

14:08.626 --> 14:11.376
and turned him into a hood ornament.
No, he went into that street on his own.

14:11.378 --> 14:12.777
I didn't do either one
of those things.

14:12.779 --> 14:13.979
Come on, whose side are you on?

14:13.981 --> 14:16.632
Yours, but the
ambulance chaser

14:16.634 --> 14:19.951
who's going to be questioning
you for the deposition has

14:19.953 --> 14:23.055
one thing on his mind, and
it ain't justice, it's money.

14:23.057 --> 14:24.456
You got me?

14:24.458 --> 14:27.342
Got you.

14:27.344 --> 14:30.512
BAEZ: <i>So, you know the sarge</i>
<i>of this narcotics unit?</i>

14:30.514 --> 14:33.982
Yeah, and I want to find
out why he's been sitting

14:33.984 --> 14:36.351
on Joe Frye's
gym for months.

14:36.353 --> 14:37.319
Can I ask you a question?

14:37.321 --> 14:38.820
Shoot.

14:38.822 --> 14:40.322
Are you just mad
'cause someone smacked

14:40.324 --> 14:42.157
your high school girlfriend
around?

14:42.159 --> 14:45.661
I just got a bad
feeling about the guy.

14:45.663 --> 14:49.114
I'm just guessing here,
but in high school

14:49.116 --> 14:50.916
she was the queen bee,
super good looking,

14:50.918 --> 14:55.287
a little crazy,
and dynamite in the sack?

14:55.289 --> 14:57.456
That'd be a fair guess, yes.

14:57.458 --> 14:59.007
Okay, still guessing here:

14:59.009 --> 15:01.093
she broke up with you,
and to this day

15:01.095 --> 15:04.379
you feel like you've got to
prove that she shouldn't have.

15:04.381 --> 15:07.966
I just got a bad feeling
about the guy is all.

15:07.968 --> 15:11.336
Okay.
Okay.

15:14.173 --> 15:16.341
All right, we're looking
for Sergeant Clancy.

15:16.343 --> 15:17.893
He's right over there.

15:17.895 --> 15:19.478
All right, thanks.

15:19.480 --> 15:20.896
Nice job.

15:20.898 --> 15:22.197
Hey, Sarge.

15:22.199 --> 15:26.184
Danny, you old son of gun,
it's good to see you.

15:26.186 --> 15:27.402
You still look
the same.

15:27.404 --> 15:29.237
And you still look
like a bulldog.

15:29.239 --> 15:30.272
An old bulldog.

15:30.274 --> 15:31.856
This is my partner
Maria Baez.

15:31.858 --> 15:33.191
Hey, nice to meet you.

15:33.193 --> 15:34.242
Likewise.

15:34.244 --> 15:36.694
So, Joe ye-- you
like him for something?

15:36.696 --> 15:38.880
Well, I don't like him at all.
Why you sitting on him?

15:38.882 --> 15:42.988
Well, lot of kites about
illegal steroids and...

15:43.013 --> 15:43.419
No.

15:43.420 --> 15:45.637
...HGH traffic going on out
of there, but the bigger thing

15:45.639 --> 15:47.639
is this Sam Cummings kid.

15:47.641 --> 15:48.807
You remember?

15:48.809 --> 15:50.092
Sam Cummings--
sounds familiar.

15:50.094 --> 15:51.560
Refresh me.

15:51.562 --> 15:52.978
All-State Lacrosse player
from Bay Ridge

15:52.980 --> 15:54.563
got a full ride
at Duke

15:54.565 --> 15:56.148
and dropped dead the
third day of practice

15:56.150 --> 15:58.433
from a steroid-induced
heart attack.

15:58.435 --> 16:00.102
Yeah, Bay Ridge, I
remember that kid.

16:00.104 --> 16:01.903
Personal trainer...

16:01.905 --> 16:03.155
Joe Frye?

16:03.157 --> 16:05.690
Yeah, we figure he's been
feeding him steroids,

16:05.692 --> 16:08.660
wanted him for manslaughter
for the death of the kid.

16:08.662 --> 16:10.529
Couldn't get enough for
a warrant on account

16:10.531 --> 16:12.164
of he dies out of state.

16:12.166 --> 16:13.498
The case is still open.

16:13.500 --> 16:15.567
You guys ever think
about sending in undercovers?

16:15.569 --> 16:18.286
Yeah, first guy in
got made right away

16:18.288 --> 16:20.338
playing softball with
some denizen of the gym.

16:20.340 --> 16:22.874
After that the gym got
very security conscious.

16:22.876 --> 16:25.761
Tried to insert another
guy, got nowhere.

16:25.763 --> 16:27.629
Guess Joe Frye is not
as dumb as he looks, huh?

16:27.631 --> 16:28.630
(chuckles)

16:28.632 --> 16:30.766
Maybe you should
send in a girl.

16:33.302 --> 16:35.086
Well, she'd have to be pretty.

16:35.088 --> 16:36.555
I like the idea of a brunette.

16:36.557 --> 16:38.890
Hmm, a pretty brunette.

16:40.059 --> 16:41.092
You game?

16:41.094 --> 16:42.227
I'm game.

16:42.229 --> 16:43.361
Well,

16:43.363 --> 16:45.397
I'll call your C.O.
and ask to borrow

16:45.399 --> 16:47.732
a cup of the two of you.

16:47.734 --> 16:49.951
Okay, sounds like a plan.

16:55.918 --> 16:58.804
Inspector General
Peterson, sir.

16:59.656 --> 17:02.307
Okay.

17:02.309 --> 17:04.226
Thank you.

17:04.228 --> 17:05.644
Hello, Kelly.

17:05.646 --> 17:07.212
Frank.

17:07.214 --> 17:08.430
Please sit down.

17:08.432 --> 17:11.400
Oh... thank you.

17:13.202 --> 17:14.869
Thanks for fitting me in.

17:14.872 --> 17:16.371
Sure.

17:16.373 --> 17:17.623
What's on your mind?

17:17.625 --> 17:19.458
I assume you're aware
of the pending civil suit

17:19.460 --> 17:21.776
against the city
by the Cisneros family.

17:21.778 --> 17:24.212
They're blaming the JRIP
program for the chain

17:24.214 --> 17:26.498
of events that led to
their son's injuries.

17:26.500 --> 17:29.334
Well aware, as I am
of the suit against the city

17:29.336 --> 17:33.005
where a woman claims that the
school free hot lunch program

17:33.007 --> 17:35.641
caused her son
to be morbidly obese.

17:35.643 --> 17:37.059
(chuckles)

17:37.061 --> 17:38.143
You're always so well prepped.

17:38.145 --> 17:39.144
I admire that.

17:39.146 --> 17:40.095
Thank you.

17:40.097 --> 17:41.813
Nevertheless,
the Bureau

17:41.815 --> 17:45.150
of Law and Adjustment
and the city council

17:45.152 --> 17:47.352
and the comptroller's office
are all very concerned

17:47.354 --> 17:49.521
about the spike
in lawsuits

17:49.523 --> 17:53.025
directly related to the Juvenile
Robbery Intervention Program.

17:53.027 --> 17:55.410
Are they also aware
that the program

17:55.412 --> 17:58.280
has demonstrated
significant results?

17:58.282 --> 18:00.616
All they see are legal bills.

18:00.618 --> 18:02.417
That's their job, not mine.

18:02.419 --> 18:06.088
I'm considering a recommendation
to eliminate the program.

18:06.956 --> 18:09.341
(sighs)

18:11.160 --> 18:14.463
We arrest a kid and put him
in a correction system

18:14.465 --> 18:17.382
where there's a very good chance
he will not be corrected.

18:17.384 --> 18:20.802
We are minting
a career criminal.

18:20.804 --> 18:21.970
This is a chance

18:21.972 --> 18:24.106
to break that cycle.

18:24.108 --> 18:26.141
You're putting kids
in harm's way.

18:26.143 --> 18:27.943
These kids live in harm's way.

18:27.945 --> 18:30.445
We're trying to do
something about that.

18:30.447 --> 18:33.348
This city pays
out $100 million

18:33.350 --> 18:35.684
a year in legal claims.

18:35.686 --> 18:38.954
That's not insurance, that's
a line item in the budget.

18:38.956 --> 18:43.709
It costs $168,000 a year
to keep someone in a city jail.

18:43.711 --> 18:45.911
You got an abacus?
We'll do the math.

18:45.913 --> 18:48.997
And what does it do to the soul
of this city if we don't take

18:48.999 --> 18:52.417
extraordinary measures
to save the ones we can?

18:52.419 --> 18:55.887
The "soul of the city" is not
a line item in the budget.

18:55.889 --> 18:58.507
Well, maybe it ought to be.

19:00.059 --> 19:02.728
What happens if a
kid gets killed?

19:02.730 --> 19:06.732
Tragically, kids get killed
all the time--

19:06.734 --> 19:09.768
the very kids
we're trying to help.

19:11.437 --> 19:12.771
(sighs)

19:12.773 --> 19:15.323
Let me be very clear here.

19:16.943 --> 19:19.828
Do not go up against me on this.

19:20.613 --> 19:23.181
Or what?

19:27.336 --> 19:29.421
JAMIE:
<i>Jonny Borrero</i>

19:29.423 --> 19:31.923
and Ricky Cisneros were
pursuing him, and realizing

19:31.925 --> 19:34.876
that Tomas Lugo was in danger,
I gave chase.

19:34.878 --> 19:36.962
I identified myself as
a police officer several times.

19:36.964 --> 19:38.597
Unfortunately

19:38.599 --> 19:42.801
Ricky Cisneros,
while chasing Tomas,

19:42.803 --> 19:45.437
was struck
by an oncoming vehicle.

19:45.439 --> 19:47.723
Are you asking us
to believe the fact

19:47.725 --> 19:50.058
that Mr. Cisneros'
alleged association

19:50.060 --> 19:52.093
with gang activities

19:52.095 --> 19:55.447
at the Bitterman houses, where
your late partner was killed,

19:55.449 --> 19:56.732
didn't influence

19:56.734 --> 19:59.701
your decisions on the day
we're talking about?

19:59.703 --> 20:01.203
I don't care what you believe.

20:01.205 --> 20:02.270
(scoffs)

20:02.272 --> 20:03.938
Well, you ought to.

20:03.940 --> 20:06.992
It had no bearing
on my decision making.

20:06.994 --> 20:09.127
My partner Vinny Cruz
was a good cop--

20:09.129 --> 20:10.912
a good Latino cop
who gave his life

20:10.914 --> 20:12.280
trying to make
the Bitterman houses,

20:12.282 --> 20:14.966
where he grew up,
a safer place.

20:14.968 --> 20:18.503
I try to honor his memory
by continuing that work.

20:18.505 --> 20:20.388
By identifying and winnowing out

20:20.390 --> 20:22.624
the ones you see
as, as bad guys.

20:22.626 --> 20:23.675
I didn't say that.

20:23.677 --> 20:25.010
You didn't have to.

20:25.012 --> 20:26.511
Actions speak louder than words.

20:26.513 --> 20:28.129
In this case,
by mentoring Tomas Lugo

20:28.131 --> 20:30.398
as part of the JRIP program

20:30.400 --> 20:33.351
on my time
and sometimes on my dime.

20:33.353 --> 20:36.688
Let's go back to the initial
confrontation in the gym,

20:36.690 --> 20:38.990
shall we?

20:38.992 --> 20:40.992
So over here you got
your treadmills,

20:40.994 --> 20:43.862
ellipticals, all that,
plus you could plug in

20:43.864 --> 20:45.664
your headphones,
watch TV, you know.

20:45.666 --> 20:47.365
Wow, it's fantastic.

20:47.367 --> 20:48.333
Yeah, right?

20:48.335 --> 20:50.836
So, what are
your workout goals?

20:50.838 --> 20:53.488
Oh, it's a little
embarrassing.

20:53.490 --> 20:54.372
Hey, you're talking to a guy

20:54.374 --> 20:56.258
that used to weigh
a buck 45 soaking wet.

20:56.260 --> 20:58.493
I'm all about the dream.

20:58.495 --> 21:01.630
I just found out my friend
is having one of those

21:01.632 --> 21:04.182
destination
weddings in Aruba.

21:04.184 --> 21:05.300
Sweet.
And I'm,

21:05.302 --> 21:08.854
like, the maid of honor
and I really want

21:08.856 --> 21:10.856
to have, like, the
best body of my life.

21:10.858 --> 21:12.190
Photos are forever.

21:12.192 --> 21:14.142
Yeah, true that.
The wedding's in a couple of months,

21:14.144 --> 21:16.528
so I'm kind of in a hurry.

21:16.530 --> 21:18.680
I'm thinking about getting
a personal trainer.

21:18.682 --> 21:20.365
I don't know.
I'm certified.

21:20.367 --> 21:21.483
Really?

21:21.485 --> 21:24.736
Yeah, I could do
a lot for your body.

21:25.621 --> 21:27.906
That'd be cool.

21:27.908 --> 21:30.375
There she is.

21:31.210 --> 21:32.694
How'd it go
at the gym?

21:32.696 --> 21:35.547
Well, I now have a personal
trainer and-- fingers crossed--

21:35.549 --> 21:37.332
a real shot at a buff boyfriend.

21:37.334 --> 21:39.334
Well, dreams do come true.

21:39.336 --> 21:40.468
What's your play?

21:40.470 --> 21:41.636
We got to make a buy, right?

21:41.638 --> 21:42.888
Yes, we do.
And our best bet

21:42.890 --> 21:46.091
would be Mexican Dragon
in 500 milligram doses.

21:46.093 --> 21:48.143
That's what they found
in the Cummings kid.

21:48.145 --> 21:50.211
Good.

21:50.213 --> 21:51.813
You sure you're up for this?

21:52.932 --> 21:54.266
But not like that.

21:54.268 --> 21:55.567
Not like what?
Well, she can buy the brand,

21:55.569 --> 21:57.886
but she can't buy that dose.
If she buys

21:57.888 --> 21:59.771
the same dose as a
college kid twice her size,

21:59.773 --> 22:01.323
she's gonna get made.

22:02.441 --> 22:04.109
I'll see
what the smaller doses are.

22:04.111 --> 22:05.911
Good.

22:07.830 --> 22:11.199
...and the guys was waitin' for
me and they started chasing me,

22:11.201 --> 22:12.617
you know,
playin' around,

22:12.619 --> 22:14.536
I guess.

22:14.538 --> 22:16.454
And Jamie...

22:16.456 --> 22:17.839
Officer Reagan

22:17.841 --> 22:20.258
started chasin'
after us.

22:20.260 --> 22:22.928
I guess he thought I was gonna
get beat up or something.

22:22.930 --> 22:26.798
A-And did he identify himself
as a police officer?

22:27.683 --> 22:29.584
I don't know.

22:29.586 --> 22:31.202
I mean,
I was runnin'

22:31.204 --> 22:34.189
and... then I heard
the brakes screech.

22:34.191 --> 22:35.857
And that's when Ricky got hit.

22:35.859 --> 22:38.927
But shortly after the accident

22:38.929 --> 22:41.095
you gave a statement
to detectives that...

22:41.097 --> 22:43.431
Officer Reagan
did in fact

22:43.433 --> 22:45.066
identify himself
as a police officer.

22:45.068 --> 22:46.902
Is that not true?

22:46.904 --> 22:49.321
I mean, I said that.

22:49.323 --> 22:52.123
But... you know,
when I think about it,

22:52.125 --> 22:55.443
it's like...
somebody said, "Police."

22:55.445 --> 22:57.445
I mean, I heard the word
but I don't know who said it

22:57.447 --> 22:59.798
'cause I was runnin'.

23:00.633 --> 23:02.834
No further questions.

23:04.620 --> 23:06.788
(speaking indistinctly)

23:09.625 --> 23:11.125
That's not good.

23:11.127 --> 23:12.644
What?

23:12.646 --> 23:15.764
Looks like your friend
threw you under the bus.

23:15.766 --> 23:16.815
What are you talking about?

23:16.817 --> 23:18.233
Well, look at him.

23:20.152 --> 23:21.653
They flipped him.

23:21.655 --> 23:23.855
Damn.

23:25.574 --> 23:27.642
Yo, Tomas. Hold up.

23:27.644 --> 23:30.245
Hey, yo, man. Why don't
you just leave him alone?

23:30.247 --> 23:31.980
Ain't you done
enough damage?

23:31.982 --> 23:33.365
Hey, we need to talk.

23:33.367 --> 23:34.332
He ain't got nothing
to say to you.

23:34.334 --> 23:37.318
Aunt Marisol,
let me handle this.

23:37.320 --> 23:39.320
What happened?
You changed your story?

23:39.322 --> 23:40.822
I just wasn't sure.

23:40.824 --> 23:42.457
No. No, come on, man.
You changed your story.

23:42.459 --> 23:43.856
What happened? Y-You lied.
Why'd you lie?

23:43.881 --> 23:44.543
You don't think

23:44.544 --> 23:46.711
they're gonna kick my ass
if I screw this up for them?

23:46.713 --> 23:49.047
All that cash
that Ricky got coming?

23:49.049 --> 23:52.384
And maybe they break a piece of
that off for me and my aunt.

23:52.386 --> 23:53.685
Is that what they promised you?

23:53.687 --> 23:55.303
Man, I ain't sayin' nothin'.

23:55.305 --> 23:56.671
Come on. I know you.

23:56.673 --> 23:57.939
You don't know me.

23:57.941 --> 24:00.225
Make a choice: me or them,
right or wrong.

24:00.227 --> 24:02.477
You don't know me.

24:05.314 --> 24:07.565
So, what, you fooled me,
huh? Is that it?

24:07.567 --> 24:10.118
Huh? You fooled me?!

24:11.537 --> 24:13.705
Good for you.

24:14.540 --> 24:17.459
Good for you.

24:28.698 --> 24:31.150
Hey. How's homework, guys?

24:31.151 --> 24:33.118
Good, good.

24:33.120 --> 24:34.386
Hi.

24:34.388 --> 24:35.654
Hi.

24:35.656 --> 24:36.855
You made dinner?

24:36.857 --> 24:39.057
Ace detective work.

24:41.461 --> 24:42.944
Nice.

24:42.946 --> 24:45.080
Can you put those
in some water for me?

24:45.082 --> 24:46.781
I can.

24:46.783 --> 24:48.450
What'd you make?

24:48.452 --> 24:49.334
The boys' favorite.

24:49.336 --> 24:52.137
Taco pie. Mm-hmm.
Taco pie?

24:52.139 --> 24:55.424
Mmm. How 'bout a table for two
at Le Madri?

24:55.426 --> 24:57.009
How 'bo we don't have
a sitter?

24:57.011 --> 25:00.512
Done. Christina Caputo confirmed
for 7:00 p.m.

25:00.514 --> 25:01.963
Really?

25:01.965 --> 25:03.682
Mm-hmm. Done and doner.

25:03.684 --> 25:07.302
(horn honking outside)
Hmm.

25:07.304 --> 25:10.022
What do you want me
to put these in?

25:10.024 --> 25:12.257
Uh, there's a vase
in the cabinet there.

25:12.259 --> 25:13.859
Come on.
Got it.

25:13.861 --> 25:14.860
This better not be

25:14.862 --> 25:17.579
the sitter.
(honking continues)

25:17.581 --> 25:19.615
It's for you.
What?

25:19.617 --> 25:21.783
Guess who.

25:22.585 --> 25:26.238
(honking continues)
Be right back.

25:27.840 --> 25:29.708
Marianne, what the hell
are you doing?

25:29.710 --> 25:31.460
Lookin' for you, obviously.

25:31.462 --> 25:33.462
Why?
Well, I called you five times

25:33.464 --> 25:34.930
and it went straight
to voice mail.

25:34.932 --> 25:36.298
I was gonna call you back.

25:36.300 --> 25:37.266
You're duckin' me!

25:37.268 --> 25:38.100
I'm not ducking you.

25:38.102 --> 25:39.334
What do you want?

25:39.336 --> 25:40.802
You went by Joe's gym?

25:40.804 --> 25:41.937
Yeah.

25:41.939 --> 25:43.689
You did?

25:43.691 --> 25:45.307
I went to straighten
the guy out.

25:45.309 --> 25:46.441
What?

25:46.443 --> 25:48.143
Well, now he's pissed off.

25:48.145 --> 25:49.695
Yeah, he's not the only one.

25:49.697 --> 25:52.013
He's pissed off at me!

25:52.015 --> 25:54.816
O... If you didn't want my help,
why did you call me?

25:54.818 --> 25:56.902
I didn't want you to go
and harass him!

25:56.904 --> 25:58.236
Dad, who's she?

25:58.821 --> 25:59.821
Get in the house.

25:59.823 --> 26:00.855
What?
Go on. You listen to me,

26:00.857 --> 26:02.991
Marianne. My husband
is a good man.

26:02.993 --> 26:04.993
He's trying to honor a pledge
he made to your brother.

26:04.995 --> 26:06.745
But you abuse the privilege.

26:06.747 --> 26:08.213
I ain't abusin' nothin'.

26:09.699 --> 26:10.865
Hey, what are you doin'?

26:10.867 --> 26:12.551
Take your sad little
lollipop act

26:12.553 --> 26:13.969
someplace else, okay?

26:13.971 --> 26:15.420
My husband
is officially

26:15.422 --> 26:17.255
off-duty when it comes to you!

26:18.257 --> 26:19.975
What are you doin'
with my phone?

26:19.977 --> 26:21.343
Danny Reagan,

26:21.345 --> 26:22.811
delete!

26:23.563 --> 26:25.480
(groans)
(starts engine)

26:28.785 --> 26:31.269
And Ambush?! Seriously?!

26:36.693 --> 26:40.195
73. All the way down.

26:40.197 --> 26:41.413
Seventy-four.

26:42.198 --> 26:44.232
75. Yeah.

26:44.234 --> 26:46.752
(sighs)
Wow.

26:46.754 --> 26:48.920
I didn't think I could do that.

26:48.922 --> 26:51.590
(exhales)
You really inspire me.

26:51.592 --> 26:52.741
Yeah?

26:52.743 --> 26:54.710
Yeah, big-time.

26:56.045 --> 26:58.597
I have a little problem though.

26:58.599 --> 26:59.548
Oh, yeah? What's that?

26:59.550 --> 27:02.551
Well, whenever I work out
like this,

27:02.553 --> 27:04.753
I'm so dead by the time
I get home,

27:04.755 --> 27:07.222
I just want to go
to sleep, and...

27:07.224 --> 27:10.592
I like to have energy
to do stuff at night.

27:10.594 --> 27:12.694
Yeah? You do?
Yeah,

27:12.696 --> 27:14.146
I do.

27:14.148 --> 27:15.313
Are there any...

27:15.315 --> 27:17.566
supplements you take
or something?

27:17.568 --> 27:19.100
What, like a vitamin pack?

27:19.102 --> 27:22.604
(chuckles) Last year, I trained
for this triathlon,

27:22.606 --> 27:24.489
and my old boyfriend

27:24.491 --> 27:28.210
gave me something
called Mexican Dragon?

27:28.212 --> 27:29.911
That stuff was dynamite.

27:29.913 --> 27:32.214
I might know somebody.

27:33.299 --> 27:35.116
Want to meet up
for a drink later?

27:35.118 --> 27:37.803
Yeah, that'd be awesome.

27:40.056 --> 27:42.758
Why do I have to hose out
the back of the car?

27:42.760 --> 27:44.125
That's what rookies do.

27:44.127 --> 27:46.311
Till when?

27:48.931 --> 27:50.348
Hey, process him.

27:50.350 --> 27:52.634
And I have to
do paperwork?

27:54.520 --> 27:56.021
You looking for me?

27:56.023 --> 27:58.473
Yes.

27:58.475 --> 28:01.743
They took Tomas' phone, and
I didn't know how to reach you.

28:01.745 --> 28:02.994
Who took it?

28:02.996 --> 28:04.329
The boys who beat him.

28:04.331 --> 28:06.498
Marisol, all due respect,

28:06.500 --> 28:07.999
there's nothing I can do
for him, okay?

28:08.001 --> 28:09.167
He made his choice.

28:09.169 --> 28:10.652
No, you have to help him.

28:10.654 --> 28:14.005
No, I don't.
He went back to the courts.

28:14.007 --> 28:15.707
What are you talking about?
I don't know

28:15.709 --> 28:17.793
if they followed him or if the
Cisneros' lawyer said something,

28:17.795 --> 28:19.961
but the word is on the street.

28:19.963 --> 28:21.379
He changed his testimony?
Yes,

28:21.381 --> 28:23.098
for you. And look at
what it got him.

28:23.100 --> 28:24.633
Into the hospital.

28:24.635 --> 28:27.335
Okay.

28:27.337 --> 28:29.688
Okay. Wait here.

28:29.690 --> 28:32.340
(siren wailing in distance)

28:32.342 --> 28:35.477
For a smart guy,
you sure are stupid sometimes.

28:35.479 --> 28:36.728
Yeah? How's that?

28:36.730 --> 28:39.815
To do right by you,
I had to do wrong by them.

28:39.817 --> 28:41.983
Good point.
Yo,

28:41.985 --> 28:43.485
just let me be.

28:43.487 --> 28:45.120
Some time will pass
and they'll forget

28:45.122 --> 28:47.873
why they're giving me
these beat-downs.

28:47.875 --> 28:49.491
That's no kind of life.

28:49.493 --> 28:51.409
Yeah, it is.
(chuckles)

28:51.411 --> 28:52.577
Mine.

28:52.579 --> 28:54.629
You stepped up for me.

28:54.631 --> 28:56.548
Now I'm gonna step up for you.

28:56.550 --> 28:57.699
And how you gonna do that?

28:57.701 --> 29:00.168
I don't know.

29:04.807 --> 29:06.808
For starters,

29:06.810 --> 29:10.345
let me get you something
from the cafeteria.

29:12.715 --> 29:14.649
Come on.

29:19.355 --> 29:23.074
I'll go for a ginger ale
and a straw.

29:23.076 --> 29:25.777
And barbeque chips.

29:26.612 --> 29:29.197
You got it.

29:33.736 --> 29:35.670
How long you been partners
with her?

29:35.672 --> 29:37.205
About six months. Why?

29:37.207 --> 29:39.207
She any good on a sting?

29:39.209 --> 29:40.625
She's my partner.

29:40.627 --> 29:44.579
She could probably
teach you a few things.

29:44.581 --> 29:46.114
I'd like that.

29:47.266 --> 29:49.384
Sorry.

29:50.520 --> 29:51.786
BAEZ:
<i>Oh, my gosh.</i>

29:51.788 --> 29:53.805
I am so sore.

29:53.807 --> 29:56.274
Probably need a good
deep-tissue massage.

29:56.276 --> 29:58.310
Definitely.

29:58.312 --> 29:59.761
I took massage.

29:59.763 --> 30:01.646
What? There's a massage school?

30:01.648 --> 30:04.432
No, it's part
of getting certified.

30:04.434 --> 30:07.035
Well, not part, but...
you can add it on,

30:07.037 --> 30:08.203
which I did.

30:08.205 --> 30:11.156
You're really
a complete package, huh?

30:11.158 --> 30:12.791
I like to think so.

30:12.793 --> 30:14.960
Speaking of which, you, um...

30:14.962 --> 30:17.045
you got that thing
we talked about?

30:17.047 --> 30:19.381
Which thing's that?

30:19.383 --> 30:21.166
You know, the...

30:21.168 --> 30:23.718
Dragon from Me-hi-co?

30:23.720 --> 30:24.920
Oh.

30:24.922 --> 30:26.054
Yeah.

30:26.056 --> 30:28.840
We talked about that.

30:31.644 --> 30:34.479
Ralphie? What?

30:34.481 --> 30:39.067
I'm just wondering
if I'm talking to a cop.

30:43.773 --> 30:45.740
You bastard.

30:45.742 --> 30:47.659
Maria!

30:47.661 --> 30:48.777
What's going on?

30:48.779 --> 30:49.811
I don't know.

30:49.813 --> 30:51.947
I think she called an audible.

30:53.532 --> 30:55.383
Ah, hold on.

30:55.385 --> 30:57.118
Give her a second.

30:57.120 --> 30:58.486
Maria, wait up.
Maria...

30:58.488 --> 31:01.539
Why? So you can insult me
some more?

31:01.541 --> 31:03.124
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

31:03.126 --> 31:04.542
What the hell
does that mean, a cop?

31:04.544 --> 31:06.294
What, am I butch to you?

31:06.296 --> 31:07.379
No, n...

31:07.381 --> 31:09.547
I thought you liked me.
I do.

31:09.549 --> 31:11.549
You wanted to help me get buff.

31:11.551 --> 31:13.518
I do.

31:13.520 --> 31:14.853
Here.

31:17.056 --> 31:18.807
It's on me.

31:18.809 --> 31:20.675
No, no, look, I'm...

31:20.677 --> 31:22.310
I'm paying.

31:22.312 --> 31:24.029
Okay? Just...
start over.

31:24.031 --> 31:25.947
Even steven.

31:25.949 --> 31:28.566
All right?
Uh...

31:28.568 --> 31:30.986
have it your way.

31:30.988 --> 31:33.204
And I'm not a cop.

31:33.206 --> 31:35.490
Detective.

31:37.043 --> 31:39.995
Whoa. Remember me, Hercules?

31:39.997 --> 31:42.580
Put the jacket down.
Turn around.

31:42.582 --> 31:44.883
Pretty good-looking
for a cop, huh?

31:44.885 --> 31:46.418
(handcuffs clicking)

31:46.420 --> 31:47.702
Nice work, partner.

31:59.274 --> 32:02.192
What's up?

32:02.194 --> 32:04.077
Two things.

32:04.079 --> 32:07.314
One is, working with Tomas Lugo
this past while,

32:07.316 --> 32:09.133
it's really hit home
how important it is

32:09.135 --> 32:10.667
to have a present father.

32:10.669 --> 32:14.772
You've been that
every single day of my life.

32:14.774 --> 32:16.490
And I'm grateful.

32:16.492 --> 32:18.709
Thank you.

32:20.912 --> 32:23.964
What's the second thing?

32:23.966 --> 32:26.333
This kid, Tomas...

32:26.335 --> 32:28.919
he really backed me up.

32:28.921 --> 32:31.138
Turned around
and changed his disposition,

32:31.140 --> 32:32.789
told the truth.

32:32.791 --> 32:36.677
But now he's a walking
punching bag for it.

32:36.679 --> 32:38.428
He needs to move.

32:38.430 --> 32:40.314
I'm not a Realtor.
No, but you have

32:40.316 --> 32:42.149
a Housing Bureau Chief,
and she's got ins

32:42.151 --> 32:44.151
with the Housing Authority.

32:44.153 --> 32:45.819
We owe Tomas.

32:45.821 --> 32:49.406
This kid got hung out to dry.
We?

32:49.408 --> 32:52.142
Well, he signed up for a program
that you helped devise,

32:52.144 --> 32:54.111
and one that you support.

32:54.113 --> 32:57.114
I mean, we can't have these kids
crap where they eat.

32:57.116 --> 32:58.415
If that's the deal,

32:58.417 --> 33:01.151
then you should just 86
the whole program.

33:01.153 --> 33:03.420
♪

33:04.989 --> 33:07.090
Tomas ask you for the favor?

33:07.092 --> 33:08.842
No.
You tell him

33:08.844 --> 33:12.012
you could make it happen?

33:12.014 --> 33:13.630
No, that's way above
my pay grade.

33:13.632 --> 33:16.216
(sighs)

33:16.218 --> 33:19.803
You can't save every puppy
in the pound, Jamie.

33:19.805 --> 33:21.972
I know it.

33:22.807 --> 33:24.975
(sighs)

33:24.977 --> 33:27.611
Come on, we're gonna get
Joe Frye sooner or later.

33:27.613 --> 33:29.046
If you cooperate,

33:29.048 --> 33:32.199
I can talk to the DA about
keeping you from doing time.

33:32.201 --> 33:34.034
I told you, I ain't talkin'.

33:34.036 --> 33:35.452
(knocking)

33:35.454 --> 33:39.189
Hey, partner. You get
anywhere with this joker?

33:39.191 --> 33:42.025
No. Let's call
it a night?

33:42.027 --> 33:44.578
Yeah. Well, normally,
Ralphie, you would spend

33:44.580 --> 33:46.830
the night down in Central Booking,
but all the arraignment judges

33:46.832 --> 33:49.383
have left for the evening, so you're
gonna have to wait till the morning

33:49.385 --> 33:51.034
when the corrections bus
comes to pick you up.

33:51.036 --> 33:51.964
BAEZ: Well, I'll take him
down to holding.

33:51.989 --> 33:53.874
Actually, that's gonna be
a problem, too.

33:54.256 --> 33:56.139
All the holding cells are full.

33:56.141 --> 33:58.508
Ralphie's just gonna have
to sit here until morning

33:58.510 --> 34:01.178
when the, uh, corrections bus
comes to pick him up.

34:01.180 --> 34:02.512
(knocking)

34:02.514 --> 34:04.903
Yeah?
Detective, can I leave this guy

34:04.904 --> 34:06.833
in here with you till the
bus comes for your guy?

34:08.353 --> 34:10.437
Well, that sounds
like a plan.

34:10.438 --> 34:11.721
Bring him in.

34:11.723 --> 34:14.024
What's your name, big fella?
Tiny.

34:14.025 --> 34:15.576
(chuckles):
Tiny? Okay.

34:15.578 --> 34:18.027
DANNY: Well, I'm sure
Ralphie here won't mind

34:18.030 --> 34:20.697
having a little company for the
evening-- ain't that right, Ralphie?

34:20.699 --> 34:23.000
Have a seat.

34:23.002 --> 34:26.119
Ralphie, this is Tiny.
Tiny, Ralphie.

34:26.121 --> 34:28.121
You two gentlemen,

34:28.123 --> 34:31.541
I'm sure, have a lot to talk about,
so you have a great evening.

34:32.844 --> 34:35.178
Good night, Ralphie.

34:37.248 --> 34:38.882
(sniffing)

34:38.884 --> 34:40.634
I smell chicken.

34:40.636 --> 34:43.437
I don't know what
you're talking about.

34:43.438 --> 34:45.472
This your first sleepover?
You know,

34:45.474 --> 34:47.556
just... chill out.

34:47.559 --> 34:49.726
Shh. We'll make it a party.

34:49.728 --> 34:51.761
You're gonna be my date.

34:51.763 --> 34:52.929
I ain't gonna be nothin'.

34:52.931 --> 34:54.281
Oh, yes, you are.

34:54.283 --> 34:56.565
You're my date tonight.

34:56.568 --> 34:58.068
(sniffs)

34:58.070 --> 34:59.903
Mmm...

34:59.905 --> 35:01.321
mm!

35:06.127 --> 35:08.045
(exhales)

35:08.047 --> 35:10.914
RALPHIE: Baez!
Ah-ah-ah.

35:10.916 --> 35:12.799
Baez!

35:12.801 --> 35:15.252
(pounding)
Baez! Baez!

35:15.254 --> 35:16.887
Okay.
Hey, Baez!

35:16.889 --> 35:18.805
What is it, Ralphie?

35:18.807 --> 35:21.141
Could we go
somewhere and talk?

35:21.143 --> 35:23.010
You messing with me?

35:23.012 --> 35:24.428
No.

35:32.603 --> 35:34.404
Come on.

35:39.410 --> 35:40.744
(clears throat)

35:40.746 --> 35:43.646
Nice work, Detective.
(chuckles) My pleasure, Detective.

35:43.648 --> 35:44.948
How's the wife,

35:44.950 --> 35:46.316
by the way?
She's great.

35:46.318 --> 35:48.618
Good. I'll see you
at the softball game Sunday.

35:48.620 --> 35:50.087
I'll be there.
All right.

35:58.379 --> 36:00.047
(sighs)

36:08.606 --> 36:10.607
These are copies?

36:10.609 --> 36:12.275
I assume so.

36:12.277 --> 36:13.944
You'd know.

36:15.846 --> 36:18.982
I am assuming the originals
are somewhere in Newark.

36:18.984 --> 36:21.034
That is everything I have.

36:21.036 --> 36:22.652
And now it's yours.

36:22.654 --> 36:24.705
I'm not sure I understand.

36:24.707 --> 36:26.573
I don't want anything
to do with them.

36:26.575 --> 36:28.075
I could have
just destroyed them;

36:28.077 --> 36:30.360
I just thought you should know
what you're dealing with.

36:30.362 --> 36:32.713
An invasion of my privacy
at a vulnerable time

36:32.715 --> 36:34.864
during a hellish divorce.

36:34.866 --> 36:36.583
That's part of it.

36:38.136 --> 36:40.504
The part that's in the past.

36:40.506 --> 36:42.222
What's the other part?

36:46.511 --> 36:49.712
The NYPD is... unique.

36:49.714 --> 36:52.516
Like the Israeli army
or the Vatican,

36:52.518 --> 36:54.717
it has its detractors.

36:54.719 --> 36:57.154
But its supporters

36:57.156 --> 37:01.358
are legion, and heaven help you
if <i>they</i> think you are

37:01.360 --> 37:03.777
monkeying with our purpose.

37:05.279 --> 37:07.414
You can't rattle me, Frank.

37:07.416 --> 37:09.833
You or your legions of fanatics.

37:09.835 --> 37:11.734
Supporters.
Whatever you want to call them.

37:11.736 --> 37:15.338
I'll skip the Kool-Aid
and stick with gin and tonic.

37:16.841 --> 37:18.508
Okay.

37:19.877 --> 37:21.962
But you can't wish it away.

37:21.964 --> 37:24.014
Is that why you asked me here?

37:24.016 --> 37:26.683
That was part of it.

37:27.602 --> 37:31.555
I am going to push to expand

37:31.557 --> 37:34.090
the JRIP program
to include the involvement

37:34.092 --> 37:38.478
of the City Housing Authority
to provide relocation options.

37:38.480 --> 37:41.698
We can't ask these kids
to crap where they eat.

37:41.700 --> 37:43.283
And I'm gonna push right back.

37:43.285 --> 37:45.368
Why?
This whole program

37:45.370 --> 37:47.320
reeks of social engineering.

37:47.322 --> 37:48.989
And honestly,

37:48.991 --> 37:51.208
I'm surprised
it has your support.

37:51.210 --> 37:52.909
This feels

37:52.911 --> 37:54.744
way out of your wheelhouse.

37:54.746 --> 37:56.630
Expect the unexpected.

37:56.632 --> 37:58.498
Is that a promise or a threat?

37:58.500 --> 38:00.283
I don't make threats.

38:00.285 --> 38:03.620
The program is
a waste of resources.

38:03.622 --> 38:06.506
Involving Housing is
only gonna compound that.

38:06.508 --> 38:08.308
(exasperated sigh)

38:08.310 --> 38:11.094
And that's the battle
I'm picking.

38:11.096 --> 38:13.296
That's yours.

38:13.298 --> 38:17.017
And anything like it
that lands on my desk.

38:17.019 --> 38:19.903
I play hard,
but I don't play dirty.

38:19.905 --> 38:22.689
Good to know.

38:31.982 --> 38:35.118
DANNY: Well, it looks like Joe
done left the building.

38:35.120 --> 38:36.369
Hit his house?

38:36.371 --> 38:39.005
I got another idea.

38:40.991 --> 38:42.792
Marianne, this is Danny.

38:42.794 --> 38:45.512
Listen, we got a warrant
for your fiancé's arrest.

38:45.514 --> 38:47.047
No, we're on our way
to his house

38:47.049 --> 38:49.683
to pick him up now, all right?
I want you to call him

38:49.685 --> 38:51.218
and talk some sense into him.

38:51.220 --> 38:52.769
Tell him to surrender--
we don't want

38:52.771 --> 38:54.604
anyone to get hurt.

38:54.606 --> 38:57.307
Just do what I say, all right?

38:58.442 --> 39:00.861
Now we'll go sit on <i>her</i> house.

39:00.863 --> 39:03.680
You sure?
Yeah. I know how she thinks.

39:16.360 --> 39:18.548
DANNY:
Joe Frye! We need to talk.

39:18.549 --> 39:21.270
Okay, fine, you know what, come on
inside, we'll talk it over inside.

39:21.416 --> 39:24.217
No. You can make it
easy or hard, Joe.

39:28.306 --> 39:31.057
BAEZ:
Stop! Police! Reagan!

39:31.059 --> 39:33.209
Around the front!
He's getting away!

39:33.211 --> 39:34.744
Call for backup!

39:38.599 --> 39:40.734
(tires squeal)
(grunting)

39:41.435 --> 39:42.769
(panting)

39:48.075 --> 39:49.593
Hold it!

39:50.661 --> 39:51.795
Hold it!

39:55.182 --> 39:56.700
(Danny yells)

39:58.502 --> 40:00.754
(sirens approaching)
DANNY: That's it. It's over, Joe.

40:00.756 --> 40:02.038
Come on.
(grunts)

40:02.040 --> 40:04.090
Stopped short
of the end zone again.

40:04.092 --> 40:05.625
Story of your life.

40:06.761 --> 40:08.011
Joey!

40:08.013 --> 40:09.930
This is all your fault,
you stupid cow!

40:09.932 --> 40:12.599
Hey! You're talking
to a lady.

40:12.601 --> 40:14.434
Knock it off.

40:15.469 --> 40:17.137
Let me go.

40:21.442 --> 40:23.944
Yeah. Marianne Romano.

40:23.946 --> 40:26.529
Marianne Romano?
She's still around?

40:26.531 --> 40:28.615
Yeah, like a bad cold
you can't shake.

40:28.617 --> 40:31.368
I remember her.
Very pretty.

40:32.436 --> 40:34.103
In a cheap sort of way.

40:34.105 --> 40:35.822
(quiet laughing)

40:35.824 --> 40:37.490
I mean, they only dated for...

40:37.492 --> 40:38.541
A month.

40:38.543 --> 40:39.909
Uh, longer than that.

40:39.911 --> 40:40.994
No.

40:40.996 --> 40:42.045
Ye...

40:42.047 --> 40:43.330
How is she looking?

40:43.332 --> 40:45.782
She looks her age.
Older.

40:45.784 --> 40:48.835
JAMIE: Hey, didn't she go to L.A.
right after you guys graduated?

40:48.837 --> 40:49.803
No.

40:49.805 --> 40:51.087
Yeah, and then somebody
swore that they

40:51.089 --> 40:52.305
saw her in a Guns N' Roses

40:52.307 --> 40:54.391
video out there, too.
Yeah.

40:54.393 --> 40:55.642
No, that was somebody else.

40:55.644 --> 40:56.726
Okay?
What?

40:56.728 --> 40:57.978
Wait, who are we talking about?

40:57.980 --> 40:59.629
Nobody.
An old friend of Dad's.

40:59.631 --> 41:01.598
But <i>not</i> of Mom's.

41:01.600 --> 41:03.350
(others laughing)

41:03.352 --> 41:05.402
Marianne the car wash girl?

41:06.136 --> 41:07.153
(laughing):
No, no.

41:07.155 --> 41:09.105
Come on, Grandp...

41:09.107 --> 41:10.690
Linda, did you make this pie

41:10.692 --> 41:12.242
from scratch?

41:12.244 --> 41:14.611
It sure is good.

41:14.613 --> 41:17.664
She worked at a car wash?
No.

41:17.666 --> 41:19.315
No, no, no, no.
They were just raising money

41:19.317 --> 41:20.367
for the school prom
or something.

41:20.369 --> 41:21.668
And being good
grandparents,

41:21.670 --> 41:24.037
Betty and I
drove the Buick over.

41:24.039 --> 41:25.422
Marianne was

41:25.424 --> 41:27.624
all wet from washing the cars.

41:27.626 --> 41:29.926
(others laughing)

41:29.928 --> 41:31.544
And Betty thought

41:31.546 --> 41:33.963
that I should arrest her
for indecent exposure.

41:36.667 --> 41:38.385
Well, you probably should have.
You know,

41:38.387 --> 41:41.054
14 years ago tonight,
I kissed a girl

41:41.056 --> 41:43.840
on the corner of 10th Street
and University Place,

41:43.842 --> 41:46.192
and my life was
never the same.

41:47.445 --> 41:48.945
That was today?

41:48.947 --> 41:51.514
Yep. We went to the movies,

41:51.516 --> 41:53.015
we saw <i>The Cider</i>
<i>House Rules,</i>

41:53.017 --> 41:56.569
we had slices afterwards, and
I even saved the ticket stubs.

41:56.571 --> 41:57.570
(laughs softly)

41:57.572 --> 42:00.022
You kept the stubs?
Yes, I did.

42:00.024 --> 42:02.242
All these years.

42:03.577 --> 42:05.245
I knew I loved you
that night...

42:05.247 --> 42:08.915
and I have known that I
love you every night since.

42:10.301 --> 42:12.719
That is so sweet.

42:12.721 --> 42:14.003
Nice save.

42:14.005 --> 42:15.221
LINDA:
Mm-hmm.

42:15.223 --> 42:18.141
I'm gonna need to see
those ticket stubs.

42:18.143 --> 42:19.676
My thought, exactly.

42:19.678 --> 42:20.560
(laughter)
