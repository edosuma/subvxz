10:44.541 --> 10:47.208
Triple-shot juggernaut.
Remixed just the way you like it.

10:47.291 --> 10:48.666
-Oat milk?
-Oh, yeah.

10:49.208 --> 10:51.250
-[giggling] Thank you.
-We learned.

10:51.333 --> 10:54.500
Do you believe this, boss?
My son's snake bit me.

10:54.583 --> 10:56.958
That's what I get
for trusting the pet store.

10:57.041 --> 11:00.666
They told me it was harmless.
Turns out to be a water moccasin.

11:00.750 --> 11:03.500
[sighing] I'm so afraid
it's gonna ruin the pitch.

11:03.583 --> 11:06.333
No, not at all.
I mean, you can barely even see it.

11:06.833 --> 11:08.250
No one will notice.

11:08.333 --> 11:09.875
-Oh, thanks.
-Merry Christmas.

11:09.958 --> 11:11.416
Is that who I think it is?

11:11.500 --> 11:13.708
-[mysterious music playing]
-[growling]

11:16.541 --> 11:17.750
[both grunting]

11:24.666 --> 11:26.791
-Are you ready for the pitch?
-I am now, Glen.

11:26.875 --> 11:29.416
-These are for you. Your favorites.
-Thank you so much.

11:29.500 --> 11:31.041
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

11:31.125 --> 11:33.750
So The Molson Group called
to confirm tomorrow's pitch,

11:33.833 --> 11:36.625
and Mr. Hanes wants to set a meeting
with you and the partners,

11:36.708 --> 11:39.708
his words, "after we close this deal."

11:39.791 --> 11:41.916
You're about to become
the first female partner

11:42.000 --> 11:43.250
in the history of this firm.

11:43.333 --> 11:45.875
-If I close Molson.
-Oh, you will.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.583
Well, not if Steve snakes it out
from under me.

11:48.666 --> 11:50.000
-Hey, Steve.
-Jess.

11:50.083 --> 11:53.375
Wow, I love your haircut.
It, it kinda makes your nose look smaller.

11:53.458 --> 11:55.458
Did you review the pitch document
I sent you?

11:55.541 --> 11:58.625
Oh, yes, yes, I did. And I gotta say,
I love reviewing your work.

11:58.708 --> 12:00.833
It just makes me feel more intelligent.

12:01.541 --> 12:02.375
Any notes?

12:03.625 --> 12:04.458
No.

12:05.083 --> 12:08.208
Let's knock 'em dead
in there tomorrow. All right?

12:08.291 --> 12:09.666
-Yes.
-You two thoroughbreds?

12:09.750 --> 12:12.958
And, by the way, you close the deal,
somebody's making partner.

12:13.458 --> 12:14.375
Partner.

12:14.458 --> 12:15.375
[Steve sighing]

12:15.458 --> 12:16.375
Good luck.

12:16.458 --> 12:17.833
[mysterious music playing]

12:18.958 --> 12:19.875
Oh, you wish.

12:20.791 --> 12:22.541
Just know, your team is here to help.

12:22.625 --> 12:25.291
Oh, you guys are the best.
I think I've got it under control.

12:25.375 --> 12:27.541
I know, I know.
You like to do everything yourself.

12:27.625 --> 12:28.708
Yeah.

12:28.791 --> 12:32.041
You're so sweet, but ultimately,
it is my responsibility.

12:32.125 --> 12:33.541
-Aye, aye, captain.
-Yeah.

12:33.625 --> 12:34.541
[rock music playing]

12:35.916 --> 12:38.333
There we go, CC. Take it down the field.

12:39.791 --> 12:40.625
Oh my God.

12:43.916 --> 12:46.625
Literally the best soccer player
I have ever seen.

12:46.708 --> 12:47.541
No offense.

12:55.583 --> 12:56.583
Yes!

12:57.250 --> 12:59.208
Hey, Walker.

12:59.833 --> 13:02.041
The War of 1812 called.
It wants its cannon back.

13:02.125 --> 13:04.166
-Thanks, Coach.
-That is a foot!

13:04.250 --> 13:05.416
[CC chuckling]

13:05.500 --> 13:07.000
Do I have a surprise for you.

13:07.083 --> 13:11.500
A scout for the national team
is comin' to the game tomorrow.

13:12.291 --> 13:13.208
Are you serious?

13:13.291 --> 13:15.666
Your mom won't be happy,
'cause you'd have to leave home,

13:15.750 --> 13:18.791
but this is an opportunity of a lifetime.

13:18.875 --> 13:22.583
You play a flawless game and we win,
you got nothin' to worry about.

13:23.375 --> 13:24.583
So do that.

13:24.666 --> 13:26.458
Don't do what I did when I had my shot

13:26.541 --> 13:29.291
and thought about
everything that could go wrong.

13:29.375 --> 13:32.333
Could mean the difference
between, uh, international athletic glory

13:32.416 --> 13:36.125
and coaching high school soccer
and teaching science.

13:37.791 --> 13:39.208
Thank you. I appreciate that.

13:39.291 --> 13:41.333
So just be yourself tomorrow.

13:41.416 --> 13:42.291
-All right?
-Okay.

13:42.375 --> 13:44.916
-And everything will be fine.
-Everything will be fine.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.583
All right. I'm proud of you. You got this.

13:48.458 --> 13:49.291
[sighing]

13:49.375 --> 13:51.791
National team? C, this is freakin' huge.

13:51.875 --> 13:53.458
Ava, it's time to go.

13:53.541 --> 13:56.041
Mommy's late for her
microdermabrasion appointment.

13:56.125 --> 13:58.833
Okay, Mom. What do you think
your mom will say about this?

13:58.916 --> 13:59.916
She'll say, um…

14:00.666 --> 14:04.041
[in robotic voice] "I am Jess Walker.
Definitely a human and not a robot."

14:04.125 --> 14:07.125
"It is mathematically more favorable
to give up on your dreams

14:07.208 --> 14:10.208
in favor of a boring life
identical to mine."

14:11.208 --> 14:13.958
CC-Bear. Hi, honey.
It's time to hit the road.

14:14.041 --> 14:15.583
The planets wait for no one.

14:16.500 --> 14:17.333
Well…

14:20.625 --> 14:21.833
[magical music playing]

14:21.916 --> 14:25.791
Hello. I am Angelica,
and I have come to town.

14:26.416 --> 14:29.541
I have just what you need for Christmas.

14:29.625 --> 14:30.500
[Jess] CC, please.

14:30.583 --> 14:34.458
[Angelica] Get a reading
during the planetary alignment.

14:34.541 --> 14:35.750
It will be magic.

14:35.833 --> 14:39.583
Ah. This family looks like it could use
a little Christmas magic.

14:39.666 --> 14:41.750
She says this to every family.
We should go.

14:41.833 --> 14:43.750
-Thank you so much.
-[Angelica] Stressed out mama.

14:43.833 --> 14:47.416
-I bet you work too hard.
-How does she know that, Mom?

14:47.500 --> 14:50.291
Because if she said Dad worked too hard,
it would be sexist.

14:50.375 --> 14:52.708
It's not magic.
It's performative liberalism.

14:52.791 --> 14:55.375
We are on borrowed time with this baby.
We need to go.

14:55.458 --> 14:57.916
-We're just here for the alignment thing.
-[Angelica] Okay.

14:58.000 --> 15:01.041
Just remember to open your hearts

15:01.125 --> 15:03.708
and view things
through the lens of one another.

15:03.791 --> 15:07.250
-Yeah.
-That'll give you the very thing you need.

15:08.333 --> 15:10.125
-Okay, thanks.
-Bye.

15:10.666 --> 15:11.500
Come on.

15:13.166 --> 15:14.583
[mysterious music playing]

15:20.208 --> 15:23.208
Oh, we're gonna grab a snack.
See you in the telescope room.

15:23.291 --> 15:25.875
-[Wyatt grunts]
-[Bill] Wyatt, why are you trippin'?

15:31.291 --> 15:33.250
-Wow.
-Come on, let me buy you ice cream.

15:33.333 --> 15:36.500
Buy me some ice cream?
Well, you know I struggle with dairy.

15:36.583 --> 15:38.833
-That's because you hold it in, Mom.
-Well…

15:38.916 --> 15:40.833
You just gotta let it rip.
Everybody farts.

15:40.916 --> 15:43.458
-I don't.
-Why would you torture yourself?

15:43.541 --> 15:46.833
Just eat some ice cream
and live in your body.

15:46.916 --> 15:47.750
Yeah.

15:48.416 --> 15:51.041
Hey, why are you being so nice to me?

15:51.958 --> 15:56.000
Can't a daughter buy her mother
some ice cream without raising suspicion?

15:56.625 --> 15:58.250
[chuckling] Not really, no.

15:59.541 --> 16:00.416
[CC sighing]

16:03.166 --> 16:08.750
There's a scout from the national team
coming to the game tomorrow,

16:08.833 --> 16:12.666
and Coach thinks I have
a pretty good shot of making it.

16:14.166 --> 16:16.458
Wow. Congratulations.

16:17.833 --> 16:22.000
But if I made it,
I would have to leave home next year.

16:24.708 --> 16:25.791
What about college?

16:25.875 --> 16:26.833
[sighing]

16:27.458 --> 16:30.250
CC, I know how much soccer means to you.

16:30.333 --> 16:31.750
-Do you?
-Trust me, I know.

16:31.833 --> 16:34.041
I wasn't much older than you.
I was Junior Olympics.

16:34.125 --> 16:35.666
I know, Mom. And I'm really sorry

16:35.750 --> 16:38.291
you had to give up your career
'cause you hurt your shoulder,

16:38.375 --> 16:40.750
but this is completely different.

16:40.833 --> 16:43.750
It's not.
I had to start completely from scratch.

16:43.833 --> 16:45.750
I'm just trying to protect you from that.

16:45.833 --> 16:48.750
-If you just applied yourself--
-I hate when you say apply myself.

16:48.833 --> 16:50.250
Mom, we are different people.

16:50.333 --> 16:53.500
You literally just want me to be you.
It's suffocating.

16:54.083 --> 16:54.958
CC.

16:55.791 --> 16:57.958
[Bill] Big Yale interview tomorrow.
You nervous?

16:58.041 --> 16:59.291
Very, very nervous.

16:59.375 --> 17:01.791
I'm afraid it might trigger
my glossophobia.

17:01.875 --> 17:04.625
Oh, buddy, I didn't know
you were scared of shiny things.

17:05.250 --> 17:06.958
It's the fear of public speaking, Dad.

17:07.750 --> 17:08.625
Right. Right.

17:09.291 --> 17:12.000
Well-- Um, hey, you know what?

17:12.083 --> 17:15.500
Just pretend like
it's our family holiday Christmas video.

17:15.583 --> 17:18.833
When you're with the family, you don't get
so afraid. You used to crush those.

17:18.916 --> 17:22.291
There's a fearless performer in there.
I know it. Right?

17:23.875 --> 17:26.125
But it does beg the question…

17:27.541 --> 17:29.541
You sure you're ready for college?

17:29.625 --> 17:33.625
Right? I mean, you're just a freshman.
You still got a lot of living to do.

17:33.708 --> 17:36.750
All I know is I would do anything
to be in your shoes right now.

17:37.583 --> 17:38.958
Maybe it's why you chose a career

17:39.041 --> 17:41.333
that brings you back
to the source of your fond memories.

17:41.416 --> 17:42.250
[Pickle moaning]

17:43.041 --> 17:43.916
Whoa.

17:45.291 --> 17:46.333
[imitating bomb]

17:46.416 --> 17:47.333
[Jess] Excuse me.

17:49.083 --> 17:50.583
[sighing] Well, this was fun.

17:50.666 --> 17:52.166
Mom thinks I have an easy life,

17:52.250 --> 17:54.458
but she has no idea
what it's like to be me.

17:54.541 --> 17:55.875
Yeah, I can relate.

17:55.958 --> 17:57.833
Dad expects me to have the same jocular,

17:57.916 --> 18:00.000
devil-may-care
high school experience that he did,

18:00.083 --> 18:02.083
but the problem is I'm not him.

18:02.166 --> 18:07.041
What did we do so wrong as parents
that our two teenagers wanna leave home?

18:07.125 --> 18:09.250
Bill, this could be
our last Christmas together.

18:09.333 --> 18:11.208
The alignment's about to start. Come on.

18:11.875 --> 18:13.291
[woman] Next group, please.

18:13.416 --> 18:15.041
[mysterious music playing]

18:17.250 --> 18:18.125
[Wyatt] Whoa.

18:19.708 --> 18:20.750
Take Pickles.

18:22.416 --> 18:23.458
[woman] Watch your step.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.541
-Exit to the left.
-[Bill] Okay.

18:25.625 --> 18:28.166
This sucks.
I really didn't wanna come to this today.

18:28.250 --> 18:30.333
This is actually not about you.

18:30.416 --> 18:33.416
-This is about the family.
-[Wyatt] My white whale. It's incredible.

18:33.500 --> 18:35.166
Wyatt, I really would appreciate--

18:35.250 --> 18:38.208
…don't care, but it means a lot
to your brother, and we're a family.

18:38.291 --> 18:39.958
It's never what we wanna do--

18:40.041 --> 18:42.541
Not a care in the world.
You get up, have a little Gatorade--

18:42.625 --> 18:43.875
I wish you could be me.

18:43.958 --> 18:47.416
I'd love for you to be me for one day.
You wouldn't make it through lunch.

18:47.500 --> 18:49.333
You don't know how much effort I put in.

18:49.416 --> 18:50.750
I gotta think about my job.

18:50.833 --> 18:53.375
I would love for you
to know what it's like to be me.

18:53.458 --> 18:56.416
-Believe it or not, I was young once.
-Like 10,000 years ago?

18:56.500 --> 18:57.625
Honestly, I wanna be you.

18:57.708 --> 19:00.541
I'd kill to eat a dozen doughnuts
and have it burn right off.

19:00.625 --> 19:02.958
What I wanna do is take a picture.
I wanna take a picture.

19:03.041 --> 19:04.166
-Yeah, okay.
-Great, picture.

19:04.250 --> 19:05.208
Okay.

19:05.291 --> 19:06.875
[mysterious music playing]

19:07.291 --> 19:09.375
-What?
-Would you take a picture of my family?

19:09.458 --> 19:11.083
Oh, it would be my pleasure.

19:11.166 --> 19:13.625
-CC, deliver this with a smile…
-Better not post this.

19:13.708 --> 19:16.333
-…to the nice lady.
-I'd rather drink my own vomit.

19:16.416 --> 19:18.875
Thank you. So you just follow what I ask.

19:18.958 --> 19:21.541
Go up like that. Don't be naughty. Up. Up.

19:21.625 --> 19:24.791
You go to the right.
You go to the left. Good. Good.

19:24.875 --> 19:27.791
Okay, Papa, suck it in.
Your tummy is, you know, it's--

19:27.875 --> 19:29.791
-Put the doggy in front of it.
-Okay.

19:29.875 --> 19:34.958
All right,
everybody say, "Merry Christmas."

19:35.041 --> 19:37.250
[all] Merry Christmas.

19:56.666 --> 19:57.708
[Wyatt] Mom!

19:59.666 --> 20:01.125
[Jess] Miles!

20:01.208 --> 20:02.541
Watch out!

20:07.041 --> 20:09.083
[soft mysterious music playing]

20:15.041 --> 20:16.125
That was crazy.

20:17.125 --> 20:19.916
-[Bill] Walkers, everybody okay?
-Did we just break the telescope?

20:20.000 --> 20:21.333
[CC] Mom, are you kidding me?

20:21.416 --> 20:23.500
-[Jess] You okay, CC?
-[CC] This is so embarrassing.

20:23.583 --> 20:26.458
-Everybody, is everyone okay?
-Mom, this is so embarrassing.

20:26.541 --> 20:27.916
[Bill] Let's get out of here.

20:33.791 --> 20:35.666

Pickles, be qu--

[gasping]

21:10.208 --> 21:11.958
[panting]

21:16.916 --> 21:19.041
-How'd you get past my security system?
-What?

21:19.125 --> 21:21.333

31:43.208 --> 31:44.666
-Just shake it off.
-I got it.

31:46.125 --> 31:48.125
-You're fine. Just shake it off.
-I'm fine.

31:48.833 --> 31:51.500
-Oh my God, CC! What are you doing here?
-Hi.

31:54.083 --> 31:55.541
Is this a new game? Like--

31:55.625 --> 31:57.625
This is my assistant, Kara.
Give her the bag.

31:57.708 --> 31:58.958
Sorry about that, Karrie.

31:59.041 --> 32:00.208
-Kara.
-Kara.

32:00.291 --> 32:02.041
Sorry. I'm just out of it. I…

32:02.583 --> 32:04.875
I hit the hard stuff
a little too hard last night.

32:04.958 --> 32:07.000
Yeah, girl, congratulations.
Girl, finally.

32:07.083 --> 32:08.625
[gasping]

32:08.708 --> 32:10.750
-It's awful, isn't it?
-Yes.

32:11.333 --> 32:12.833
No. I just--

32:12.916 --> 32:14.333
-I gotta squeeze it.
-What--

32:14.416 --> 32:15.583
Just get in there and…

32:16.833 --> 32:18.416
-Oh no!
-No.

32:18.500 --> 32:20.041
That is how things scar.

32:20.125 --> 32:21.750
[Glen] Is that who I think it is?

32:21.833 --> 32:23.000
[growling]

32:23.625 --> 32:25.458
-[groaning, moaning]
-[all clamoring]

32:26.625 --> 32:27.500
I'm sorry.

32:28.083 --> 32:31.750
I'm sorry. You can't do that.
You can't do that or you'll get kicked.

32:31.833 --> 32:33.250
-I--
-Oh, Jess.

32:33.333 --> 32:36.125
Jess. Big day, Jess. Everybody's waiting.

32:36.208 --> 32:37.750
Don't let us down.

32:38.541 --> 32:41.583
Yes, I'll be-- She'll be right there.

32:41.666 --> 32:42.666
I like it.

32:43.125 --> 32:45.750
-Who's this creature?
-Oh, I'm her daughter, CC.

32:45.833 --> 32:48.958
Oh, I can see the resemblance.
You got a big nose too.

32:50.291 --> 32:52.166
-Oh, I never--
-Did you see his nose?

32:53.125 --> 32:55.000
[CC] We just need one second to prepare.

32:55.083 --> 32:56.750
Can't believe I thought we could do it.

32:56.833 --> 33:00.166
-What happened to "Miss I Got This"?
-She fell down the steps, Mom.

33:00.250 --> 33:02.458
Oh, just give me a second.

33:02.541 --> 33:04.416
I'm so nervous. I need chocolate.

33:05.208 --> 33:07.958
-Chocolate. I need chocolate.
-Note cards.

33:08.041 --> 33:10.125
Okay, note cards. Okay.

33:12.541 --> 33:13.416
Oh.

33:19.041 --> 33:20.125
Oh, yeah.

33:23.041 --> 33:24.708
[slobbering]

33:30.000 --> 33:31.458
[muttering] So good.

33:31.541 --> 33:33.166
Cold. It's cold. It's cold.

33:34.583 --> 33:36.625
Okay, CC, look at me.

33:36.708 --> 33:39.166
I wrote the entire presentation
on note cards.

33:39.250 --> 33:40.916
All you have to do is read them.

33:41.000 --> 33:42.791
I don't know anything about architecture.

33:42.875 --> 33:45.666
We're Walkers, and Walkers never quit.

33:45.750 --> 33:48.583
Not true. We always turn a movie off
before it's over.

33:48.666 --> 33:54.250
All you have to do is W-A-L-K
into that meeting and read them.

33:54.333 --> 33:55.916
[sighing]

33:56.000 --> 33:57.791
-Be a boss.
-Be a boss.

33:57.875 --> 33:59.416
-Be a boss.
-Be a boss.

33:59.500 --> 34:01.041
-Be a boss.
-Be a boss.

34:01.125 --> 34:02.875
-Be a boss.
-Be a boss. Let's go!

34:04.458 --> 34:07.625
Whoa. Whoa.
Dad, you can't just walk out there.

34:07.708 --> 34:10.833
Keep your head down.
Make eye contact with no one.

34:10.916 --> 34:12.041
What?

34:12.125 --> 34:14.125
-You're about to run the gauntlet.
-What's that?

34:14.208 --> 34:16.500
It's very critical
that you don't stay in one place

34:16.583 --> 34:18.791
for less than four seconds
or more than seven.

34:18.875 --> 34:20.958
Hey. What's up?
Yo, Ruggles, what's up, man?

34:21.041 --> 34:24.333
Heck of a game last Friday.
Seriously. You looked like Aaron Donald.

34:24.416 --> 34:26.750
-Thanks, bud. I froze my ass off though.
-I got you.

34:26.833 --> 34:28.083
Oh, dude, I bet.

34:31.750 --> 34:33.250
-Get here.
-What?

34:33.916 --> 34:35.833
-What are you doing?
-I got some news here.

34:35.916 --> 34:38.291
Your dad happens to be the toast,
and high school's my jam.

34:38.375 --> 34:41.708
Food metaphors have no place here, Dad.
This is life and death.

34:41.791 --> 34:42.708
-I'm--
-I got it.

34:43.416 --> 34:44.833
What's up, ladies? How are we?

34:44.916 --> 34:46.458
Hey!

34:46.541 --> 34:49.125
-[indistinct chattering]
-[racy music playing]

34:59.416 --> 35:00.666
Three. Three balls!

35:02.833 --> 35:03.750
All right.

35:04.791 --> 35:05.833
[barking]

35:07.541 --> 35:08.416
No.

35:08.500 --> 35:10.708
We don't eat garbage. That's not healthy.

35:11.291 --> 35:14.625
No. Hey. Stop it.
That's the water for the doggy.

35:15.208 --> 35:18.416
No doggy water. No. Nein.

35:19.250 --> 35:20.166
[liquid running]

35:22.958 --> 35:24.000
[Miles growling]

35:26.666 --> 35:28.333
I'll give you your privacy.

35:35.708 --> 35:38.041
If, if you want me to take over,
I can take over.

35:38.125 --> 35:40.208
Oh, there she is.

35:40.291 --> 35:42.416
-Right not on time.
-[chuckling]

35:42.500 --> 35:44.166
[Hanes] Yeah. All right.

35:44.250 --> 35:48.208
Peter, I'd like to thank you
and everyone at The Molson Group

35:48.291 --> 35:49.958
for taking time to come in today.

35:50.041 --> 35:51.833
-Start.
-Love that.

35:51.916 --> 35:56.583
Our, our, our project leader
and all-around superstar, Jess Walker,

35:56.666 --> 35:58.583
is gonna lead us through the presentation.

35:58.666 --> 36:00.583
Jess? Jess, we're ready.

36:00.666 --> 36:01.583
[all applauding]

36:01.666 --> 36:02.625
-Jess.
-[Kara] Go, Jess.

36:02.708 --> 36:03.791
You're gonna like it.

36:08.416 --> 36:09.416
[Jess] Uh…

36:13.625 --> 36:15.375
Thank you for being here today.

36:15.458 --> 36:17.125
-[Molson] Yes.
-I'm gonna get started.

36:18.583 --> 36:21.166
First, I'd like to thank you
for coming today.

36:21.833 --> 36:24.083
Second, I'd like to talk about this firm

36:24.166 --> 36:27.833
because here at this firm,
we wanna exceed expectations.

36:28.583 --> 36:33.750
We want to combine beauty
and function and innovation.

36:34.583 --> 36:39.791
Here at this firm, we have no experience
building-- We have experience--

36:39.875 --> 36:41.583
-Is she okay?
-She's fine.

36:41.666 --> 36:43.708
Here at this firm, at Atlas--
Here at Atlas--

36:43.791 --> 36:45.083
[CC] The cards.

36:45.166 --> 36:46.875
[clearing throat] Cards.

36:46.958 --> 36:48.291
[stomach growling]

36:49.041 --> 36:51.041
-I know, but my eyes don't work.
-Glasses.

36:51.125 --> 36:52.958
[Jess] Okay. Um…

36:55.750 --> 36:56.750
Okay.

36:56.833 --> 36:58.250
-[all clamoring]
-I got it.

36:58.333 --> 37:01.083
-I got it.
-Hang on. Don't panic.

37:02.000 --> 37:03.958
Hang on. Okay, not to worry.

37:04.041 --> 37:06.541
You know what, Jess?
Why don't I just jump in right here?

37:06.625 --> 37:07.666
No!

37:08.416 --> 37:09.291
[Steve] I'm sorry?

37:10.291 --> 37:11.791
Really? Uh…

37:12.791 --> 37:14.958
-Sorry. Continue.
-What's going on?

37:15.041 --> 37:17.208
I'm gonna talk about the building itself.

37:17.291 --> 37:18.250
[stomach rumbling]

37:18.333 --> 37:20.541
-That's what matters.
-Yeah.

37:20.625 --> 37:22.000
-That's what we're here for.
-Yup.

37:22.083 --> 37:24.083
There's a roof and there are walls.

37:24.708 --> 37:25.791
[rumbling continues]

37:27.125 --> 37:28.583
There's a church.

37:29.583 --> 37:30.791
Here is the steeple.

37:31.875 --> 37:33.083
Open the door,

37:33.708 --> 37:34.875
see all the people.

37:37.791 --> 37:38.833
[laughing]

37:40.500 --> 37:41.625
[all laughing]

37:49.458 --> 37:50.375
[Molson] Know what?

37:50.458 --> 37:53.250
You lucky 'cause I like to laugh
as much as the next person.

37:54.458 --> 37:56.375
-You do?
-No, not really.

37:57.916 --> 38:00.333
-You know what? We're done. Thank you.
-[Hanes] Peter.

38:00.416 --> 38:02.208
-Tell him to pull the car around.
-No. No.

38:02.291 --> 38:05.083
Wait. Wait. I think what my mom
is trying to say

38:05.166 --> 38:07.458
is that we blend form and function

38:07.541 --> 38:09.833
while using the south buttress
as a tiered garden,

38:09.916 --> 38:12.291
while also supporting the central arcade.

38:12.375 --> 38:15.708
-Hm. Who's this intelligent young woman?
-Oh, I'm her daughter.

38:16.250 --> 38:20.416
And any intelligence I have is purely
because of the way my mother raised me.

38:20.500 --> 38:23.708
-[chuckling] Open that up. Let me see.
-What is going on with you?

38:23.791 --> 38:26.500
I think the ice cream
in the break room was expired.

38:26.583 --> 38:28.041
-I--
-Ice cream in the break room?

38:28.125 --> 38:30.625
I'm lactose intolerant.
That means you're lactose intolerant.

38:30.708 --> 38:33.166
It's so bad.
I don't think I can hold it in.

38:33.250 --> 38:34.875
Oh, yes you can. You wanna know why?

38:34.958 --> 38:36.958
There are 40 years of farts
in that stomach.

38:37.041 --> 38:39.833
You won't let them out
on the most important day of my career.

38:39.916 --> 38:41.916
-I don't wanna let them out.
-Just breathe.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.208
-[Steve] Jess, are you all right?
-I won't let them out.

38:44.291 --> 38:49.291
Jess, why don't you just continue to tell
Mr. Molson about the presentation?

38:49.375 --> 38:50.708
[CC clearing throat]

38:50.791 --> 38:51.791
[panting] Yeah.

38:51.875 --> 38:52.708
[stomach rumbling]

38:52.791 --> 38:53.625
I've got it. Sorry.

38:54.416 --> 38:55.583
I need to…

38:58.375 --> 38:59.250
I've got it.

39:00.458 --> 39:01.333
[Jess farting]

39:04.875 --> 39:08.083
I have to live in my body! I'm sorry!

39:08.166 --> 39:09.583
[farting continues]

39:09.666 --> 39:11.041
Oh my God.

39:11.125 --> 39:12.833
[all clamoring]

39:15.083 --> 39:16.666
She's really sorry.

39:17.791 --> 39:20.875
I cannot believe my entire future
just blew up right in front of me.

39:20.958 --> 39:23.375
That was in the past.
We have to focus on the present.

39:23.458 --> 39:25.125
You have to play soccer for me.

39:25.208 --> 39:27.333
The account. My partnership.

39:27.416 --> 39:30.750
Why didn't you ask some of those people
for help? Don't they work for you?

39:30.833 --> 39:34.000
Yes, CC, technically. But, ultimately,
it is my responsibility to--

39:34.083 --> 39:35.500
Okay, whatever. Listen up.

39:35.583 --> 39:37.291
Stand on the side, run around,

39:37.375 --> 39:41.000
but if anyone passes you the ball,
for the love of God, pass it right back.

39:41.083 --> 39:42.958
CC, I think I can handle that.

39:43.041 --> 39:46.250
And, Mom, whatever you do,
try not to be weird with my friends.

39:46.333 --> 39:48.750
Believe it or not,
I was pretty cool in high school.

39:48.833 --> 39:50.333
I'm gonna go with "or not."

39:51.500 --> 39:52.958
[upbeat music playing]

39:54.833 --> 39:58.250
-Hey! You got this, CC.
-[mumbling]

39:58.333 --> 40:01.750
-[guy] Kick some butt today.
-Butt will be kicked.

40:01.833 --> 40:04.208
-[girl] Good luck today, CC.
-Thank you.

40:05.250 --> 40:06.250
[all cheering]

40:07.500 --> 40:13.750
[all] Go, CC! Go, CC! Go, CC!

40:15.833 --> 40:18.083
Everything okay, C?
You seem a little stressed.

40:18.166 --> 40:21.500
Yeah. No, I'm fine.
I just don't really like the roughhousing.

40:21.583 --> 40:23.791
Right. By the way,
how are you liking the tattoo?

40:23.875 --> 40:25.625
-I'm getting mine this weekend.
-Do not.

40:25.708 --> 40:28.541
It was a completely irresponsible
and irrational decision,

40:28.625 --> 40:30.333
and I regretted it immediately.

40:30.416 --> 40:32.833
Did your mom see it? I bet she freaked.

40:33.500 --> 40:35.375
No. As a good mother should,

40:35.458 --> 40:37.875
she holds space
for all her children's mistakes.

40:37.958 --> 40:40.416
[chuckling] That's hilarious.
You sound just like her.

40:40.500 --> 40:43.208
[in robotic voice] "I am Jess Walker,
mother of the century,

40:43.291 --> 40:46.625
and I hold space
for all of my children's mistakes."

40:47.291 --> 40:50.000
[normal voice] Come on, bus is leaving.
It's game time, girl.

40:50.083 --> 40:51.833
-[phone ringing]
-[Miles panting]

40:54.083 --> 40:56.166
-Yes?
-Hey, Rolf, it's CC.

40:56.250 --> 40:57.208
How's it going?

40:57.291 --> 40:59.791
Uh, it's a tremendous challenge,
but I'll fix it.

40:59.875 --> 41:01.625
Have no fear. Rolf is here.

41:01.708 --> 41:04.625
What do you mean a tremendous challenge?
It's a child and a dog.

41:04.708 --> 41:05.791
Make sure they're safe.

41:05.875 --> 41:08.375
I will apply myself that much more firmly.

41:08.458 --> 41:09.666
You don't have to be firm.

41:09.750 --> 41:11.583
Keep it together.
We'll be home after the game.

41:11.666 --> 41:14.083
I must leave you now.
The training continues. Ciao.

41:14.166 --> 41:15.000
Rolf. Rolf.

41:15.083 --> 41:16.625
[Miles growling]

41:18.041 --> 41:21.583
[woman presenter] Welcome, everybody.
It's a beautiful day here at BMO Stadium.

41:21.666 --> 41:24.541
The Lucy Jones Unicorns
are going up against their archrivals,

41:24.625 --> 41:28.416
the Broadwick Daredevils
for the Southern California Championship.

41:28.958 --> 41:30.041
Come on, Unicorns.

41:30.125 --> 41:33.000
[woman presenter] The Unicorns are led
by their captain, CC Walker.

41:33.083 --> 41:36.541
She was All-American her freshman year
and has received accolades ever since.

41:36.625 --> 41:38.250
Let's not forget about the Daredevils.

41:38.333 --> 41:41.583
They got their own secret weapons,
Gisele and Alyssa Thompson,

41:41.666 --> 41:42.833
the Switchblade Sisters.

41:42.916 --> 41:43.916
But I didn't say it.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.875
Oh, this is torture.
Come on, Mom. Don't let me down.

41:46.958 --> 41:48.625
-[horn blowing]
-[crowd cheering]

41:49.416 --> 41:53.416
I think I see Alex Sullivan.
That's a scout for the US national team.

41:55.666 --> 41:56.541
Hey, girl.

41:57.208 --> 41:59.708
Oh my gosh. I'm gonna get it together.

42:00.291 --> 42:02.916
Hey, Mrs. Jenk-- Hey, Carrie. Hi, Carrie.

42:03.000 --> 42:05.333
Oh my God, I love this backwards cap vibe.

42:05.416 --> 42:07.208
Very festive. Very game day.

42:07.291 --> 42:09.791
Just a little stressed today, actually.

42:09.875 --> 42:13.125
Well, guess what?
Brought us a little game day vino.

42:13.208 --> 42:15.375
-Wine?
-Yeah.

42:15.458 --> 42:18.000
No. I'm focused on the game,
but thank you.

42:18.083 --> 42:21.500
Oh. Right, I forgot. She's a super mom.
She focuses on the game.

42:21.583 --> 42:24.791
She knows all the players' names.
I don't know anyone's name.

42:24.875 --> 42:26.250
[mysterious music playing]

42:27.541 --> 42:28.916
[gasping]

42:29.000 --> 42:29.833
Okay.

42:29.916 --> 42:31.958
Ah. You're so not prepared for this, Dad.

42:32.041 --> 42:35.291
What? I'm fine, okay? I went to college.
I can do a college interview.

42:35.375 --> 42:38.125
You went to Arizona State University.
This is Yale.

42:38.208 --> 42:41.458
Well, some would say that Arizona State
is the Yale of Southwest Tempe.

42:41.541 --> 42:42.416
N--

42:43.416 --> 42:44.625
-Wyatt.
-Yeah?

42:45.416 --> 42:47.666
I'm sorry. He-- He's Wyatt.

42:47.750 --> 42:50.583
I'm a man.
I'm an adult man with an adult body,

42:50.666 --> 42:52.000
adult body hair.

42:52.083 --> 42:53.041
I'm just like you.

42:53.125 --> 42:55.541
Actually, I'm Scandinavian.
I'm surprisingly hairless.

42:55.625 --> 42:57.375
Is your name Wyatt?

42:57.458 --> 43:00.250
[chuckling] No. 'Cause I'm a man,
and Wyatt is a child.

43:00.333 --> 43:01.416
This is Wyatt.

43:02.083 --> 43:04.416
Okay, then. We're ready for you.

43:04.500 --> 43:07.125
Okay, I'll be right in.
Thank you so much. I appreciate it.

43:07.208 --> 43:08.041
[Wyatt sighing]

43:08.125 --> 43:10.708
My God, man, get a grip.
What are we doing?

43:11.250 --> 43:12.791
All right? Relax, okay?

43:12.875 --> 43:15.416
Hey, when we play Jeopardy,
who always wins?

43:15.500 --> 43:17.708
-Me.
-Okay, yeah, well, besides you?

43:17.791 --> 43:19.833
-Mom.
-Okay, well, I beat CC, don't I?

43:19.916 --> 43:23.083
-She never even watches with us.
-Okay, when we watch Is It Cake?

43:23.166 --> 43:25.125
I'm always the first to guess
if it's cake.

43:25.208 --> 43:29.125
-You are freakishly good at that.
-Thank you. Now wish me luck, okay?

43:29.208 --> 43:32.166
Ninety minutes. Ninety minutes.
Ninety minutes.

43:32.250 --> 43:33.375
[crowd cheering]

43:35.041 --> 43:36.416
[male presenter] And away we go.

43:36.500 --> 43:38.291
Come on, Unicorns! Come on, Unis!

43:39.083 --> 43:40.833
[woman presenter] And her first touch is…

43:40.916 --> 43:42.750
-[crowd clamoring]
-[whistle blowing]

43:42.833 --> 43:45.250
…literally touching the ball
with her hands.

43:45.958 --> 43:47.041
She caught the ball.

43:48.083 --> 43:50.291
-[whistle blowing]
-[crowd clamoring]

43:50.375 --> 43:52.875
-She caught it.
-Oh God, are you gonna be okay?

43:53.666 --> 43:56.000
He saw her catch it. What is she doing?

43:56.833 --> 43:58.625
She's hitting today.

43:58.708 --> 44:02.083
The trick is you watch it on a tablet,

44:02.166 --> 44:05.541
and then you can screengrab an image
and zoom in on it.

44:06.291 --> 44:07.916
Once you see those brush marks,

44:09.000 --> 44:10.500
that's how you know it's cake.

44:14.958 --> 44:16.791
-Don't snap back.
-Yeah, we don't snap.

44:20.375 --> 44:22.375
Is this, is this Flashdance?

44:23.166 --> 44:26.291
Wyatt, just as a courtesy,
if you wanna start this over…

44:26.375 --> 44:27.250
Oh, please, no.

44:28.041 --> 44:30.750
-No? You wanna hit save on…
-Yeah.

44:30.833 --> 44:32.458
[Bill groaning]

44:32.541 --> 44:34.541
The body language is all wrong.

44:34.625 --> 44:37.041
That is not enjoyment. That is judgment.

44:37.125 --> 44:38.583
-Hey, Mr. Walker.
-[screaming]

44:38.666 --> 44:40.000
Then Dave Grohl joined the band,

44:40.083 --> 44:42.791
and they recorded Nevermind
in the spring of 1991.

44:42.875 --> 44:43.791
Ariana.

44:43.875 --> 44:45.291
-Is that Wyatt in there?
-Yes.

44:45.375 --> 44:46.583
[clearing throat]

44:46.666 --> 44:48.875
Yeah. Wyatt's in there. He's not out here.

44:48.958 --> 44:51.333
You know, I'm happy for him about Yale.
It's just…

44:51.791 --> 44:53.541
I don't know. It's sad to see him go.

44:54.333 --> 44:55.791
-Yeah? You'd be sad?
-Of course.

44:55.875 --> 44:58.833
I mean, we've lived a block
away from each other since I was born.

44:58.916 --> 45:01.500
You know, we always
used to play together as kids.

45:01.583 --> 45:03.333
We even had this
Christmas teddy bear thing

45:03.416 --> 45:05.333
we used to pass around each year.

45:05.833 --> 45:07.625
-You remember that?
-Of course I do.

45:07.708 --> 45:11.083
He's such a kind and thoughtful guy,
and honestly, there's so few of them.

45:11.166 --> 45:12.916
He's really tough. He does karate.

45:13.666 --> 45:15.791
Yeah. He's got two stripes
on his white belt.

45:15.875 --> 45:18.458
Should be a yellow belt.
His sensei said he cried during his test,

45:18.541 --> 45:21.541
which is insane
'cause he almost never cries in real life.

45:22.125 --> 45:23.875
-[Jess] Get it to CC!
-[Carrie] Oh my gosh.

45:23.958 --> 45:28.208
Girl. Okay, remember I told you that
John and I were having a little issue?

45:28.291 --> 45:30.958
I tried that crazy thing
you told me about from college.

45:31.041 --> 45:32.666
It worked. I went…

45:32.750 --> 45:34.791
[sound warping, slowing down]

45:38.166 --> 45:40.208
[sweeping music playing]

45:44.500 --> 45:46.541
[deep bass playing]

45:52.458 --> 45:55.375
Walker gets sliced and diced
by the Switchblade Sisters!

45:55.458 --> 45:58.375
It's a red card! Cut her from behind.
You saw that, right?

45:58.458 --> 46:00.125
-You saw that?
-Yeah.

46:00.208 --> 46:03.291
Can't imagine the national scout
is pleased with this performance.

46:03.375 --> 46:05.500
-Pass me some of that wine?
-Absolutely.

46:05.583 --> 46:06.750
Oh.

46:06.833 --> 46:08.291
We would be remiss

46:08.375 --> 46:11.333
if we didn't talk about
the very exciting work

46:11.416 --> 46:14.500
that you appear to be doing
with the Riemann hypothesis.

46:15.375 --> 46:16.291
Solved it.

46:17.416 --> 46:18.541
[all laughing]

46:19.875 --> 46:24.833
-One of Hilbert's 23 unsolved problems?
-Yeah, tell Hillbilly he's down to 22.

46:25.416 --> 46:28.625
Okay, Hillbilly has been dead
for 80 years.

46:28.708 --> 46:33.333
As someone who has wrestled with Riemann,
I'm curious, which way are you leaning?

46:34.000 --> 46:35.166
True or false?

46:36.000 --> 46:36.833
False.

46:37.500 --> 46:39.958
-[Peter] Ira.
-Suck a duck.

46:40.041 --> 46:41.041
Take a breath.

46:41.125 --> 46:44.666
The Clay Institute offers a $1 million
prize to anyone who can solve Riemann.

46:44.750 --> 46:48.041
We would love if you could show
some of your work here right now.

46:48.125 --> 46:49.041
[Peter] Thrilled.

46:49.125 --> 46:50.541
[suspenseful music playing]

46:50.625 --> 46:52.500
Um… [muttering]

46:52.583 --> 46:53.500
Ree-man?

46:55.958 --> 47:00.541
I thought you said Redman.
I solved his hypothesis.

47:00.625 --> 47:03.833
-The Redman hypothesis?
-Redman hypothesis?

47:03.916 --> 47:05.208
From Wu-Tang?

47:05.291 --> 47:07.333
-[dramatic music playing]
-[crowd cheering]

47:09.875 --> 47:10.708
Come on.

47:10.791 --> 47:12.125
[presenter] CC Walker sleeping

47:12.208 --> 47:14.125
as that ball rolled
right between her legs.

47:17.166 --> 47:19.208
[male presenter]
The Daredevils with a one-zero lead.

47:19.291 --> 47:22.375
Oh, this is torture.
You are ruining my life!

47:23.041 --> 47:26.083
When parents yell from the sidelines,
it puts pressure on the kids.

47:26.166 --> 47:28.750
She popped out three kids,
and she works 60 hours a week.

47:28.833 --> 47:31.666
I think she can handle
a little bit of constructive criticism!

47:31.750 --> 47:33.916
I gotta get outta here.
I gotta get outta here.

47:35.291 --> 47:36.708
That's my girl.

47:37.958 --> 47:38.833
CC, I'm coming.

47:38.916 --> 47:41.583
-Looks like we have a helicopter mom.
-Excuse me!

47:42.791 --> 47:43.791
[crowd clamoring]

47:43.875 --> 47:45.416
Black Hawk down.

47:45.500 --> 47:47.416
Is that a Minecraft sticker
on your bottle?

47:47.500 --> 47:49.041
-Yeah, I love Minecraft.
-You do?

47:49.125 --> 47:50.541
-Yeah.
-What about Dune?

47:51.000 --> 47:52.958
Wanna talk about the original
or the new one?

47:53.041 --> 47:56.541
-I actually wanna talk about the novel.
-Frank Herbert is my favorite author.

47:56.625 --> 47:58.500
-[gasping] What?
-Mm-hmm.

47:59.583 --> 48:02.666
Any chance you're a vegetarian
who's open to cloned meats?

48:02.750 --> 48:03.791
Obviously.

48:03.875 --> 48:07.916
Obviously. Right?
It's the only ethical, sensible way to be.

48:08.000 --> 48:10.916
-How do you feel about cyborgs?
-Robots kinda freak me out.

48:11.000 --> 48:12.750
-Sure, totally. Robots are stupid.
-No.

48:12.833 --> 48:15.416
Hey, you think Wyatt
might wanna go to Hunter's party?

48:16.500 --> 48:18.458
-Hunter Drew is having a party?
-Mm-hmm.

48:18.541 --> 48:20.416
Maybe I'll be able to hang out with him.

48:21.000 --> 48:22.916
I think he might be there.

48:23.000 --> 48:24.916
All right, cool. See you, Mr. Walker.

48:25.625 --> 48:26.666
Bye.

48:28.541 --> 48:31.916
Don't, don't stand up on the chair. What?

48:32.000 --> 48:34.291
-Push up.
-Push up. Mrs. Walker.

48:34.375 --> 48:35.375
Sorry.

48:36.125 --> 48:37.166
[coach] Hustle!

48:37.250 --> 48:38.916
-Pass and move.
-Pass and move. Come on!

48:39.000 --> 48:40.541
Seriously, I got this.

48:40.625 --> 48:42.000
-Jeez.
-Sorry.

48:42.583 --> 48:44.458
[both] Watch out for that sweeper!

48:44.541 --> 48:46.375
[both] Take the shot!

48:46.458 --> 48:48.166
-Goal!
-Goal!

48:48.250 --> 48:49.166
[crowd cheering]

48:50.958 --> 48:54.250
Okay, Mrs. Walker,
I appreciate the enthusiasm,

48:54.333 --> 48:56.083
but parents are not allowed down here.

48:56.166 --> 48:57.333
Ever since that lawsuit.

48:57.416 --> 48:58.791
-You know this.
-Sorry.

48:58.875 --> 49:00.250
[whistle blowing]

49:00.333 --> 49:02.625
Come on, let's huddle up.
Come on. Bring it in.

49:02.708 --> 49:05.166
All right. You guys can't hear this.
Get away. Get away.

49:05.250 --> 49:07.166
You're giving me everything. I want more.

49:07.250 --> 49:09.166
Put pressure. We gotta play our game--

49:09.250 --> 49:12.666
Excuse me. I think we gotta switch
from a 4-4-2 to a 4-3-3.

49:12.750 --> 49:14.500
You need the extra attacker out there

49:14.583 --> 49:16.583
if we're gonna generate
any scoring opportunities.

49:16.666 --> 49:19.083
-Let me have that board.
-That's mine. That's my board.

49:19.166 --> 49:22.375
When you get that outer pass from Ava,
I want the attackers upfield.

49:22.458 --> 49:24.958
They're gonna overcompensate,
and that'll be wide open.

49:25.041 --> 49:26.916
This is what we've waited for
since kindergarten.

49:27.000 --> 49:27.916
What?

49:28.458 --> 49:29.916
-Team on three.
-Team on three.

49:30.000 --> 49:31.291
-One, two, three, team.
-Team!

49:31.375 --> 49:32.416
[dramatic music playing]

49:32.500 --> 49:35.666
They've switched from a 4-4-2 to a 4-3-3.

49:35.750 --> 49:37.291
Someone give CC the ball.

49:37.375 --> 49:39.458
-She's ready. She's open.
-[coach] Pass it.

49:40.500 --> 49:43.125
There's a lob passed to CC Walker.
She's wide open.

49:43.208 --> 49:45.291
-She's got it!
-Come on! Let's go!

49:45.375 --> 49:46.583
-Let's go!
-CC, get it!

49:46.666 --> 49:49.791
-A chance for the game-winning goal.
-You got it, CC! You got it!

49:50.541 --> 49:51.875
[crowd clamoring]

49:51.958 --> 49:53.541
[dramatic music continues]

49:58.041 --> 49:59.750
You can't just-- Put it in, CC!

49:59.833 --> 50:02.416
Do it! Do it, Mama! Do it!
What are you doing, Mama!

50:02.500 --> 50:04.083
What's she doing?

50:04.166 --> 50:05.416
-You okay?
-No.

50:05.500 --> 50:06.416
What is she doing?

50:06.500 --> 50:08.833
I believe she's helping
the opposing player.

50:08.916 --> 50:10.083
Here, I'll help you.

50:10.166 --> 50:13.250
You know, CC Walker's hopes
for the national team

50:13.333 --> 50:14.791
dashed right in front of us.

50:14.875 --> 50:17.166
[male presenter] Pretty sad day.
Tell you that much.

50:24.000 --> 50:25.833
CC, I said I was sorry.

50:28.000 --> 50:30.916
Well, you always said
soccer doesn't make a real career.

50:31.000 --> 50:32.625
Thanks to you, it never will be.

50:32.708 --> 50:35.875
Honey, there will be other chances
at the national team.

50:35.958 --> 50:37.375
You don't get it

50:37.458 --> 50:42.541
because you don't really care about me
and about what actually makes me happy.

50:42.625 --> 50:46.791
You just want me to be like you
and think like you and act like you.

50:48.125 --> 50:49.750
It's not about the national team.

50:51.416 --> 50:53.041
I just wanna get away from you.

50:54.833 --> 50:56.875
[somber music playing]

51:03.166 --> 51:04.750
Nein. Aus.

51:05.833 --> 51:07.083
Aus. Stuck.

51:07.166 --> 51:08.791
Drop it.

51:08.875 --> 51:10.875
[Miles panting]

51:14.208 --> 51:15.500
[Miles barking]

51:16.208 --> 51:17.291
What?

51:17.375 --> 51:19.875
-What, wha-- What do you want?
-[barking]

51:19.958 --> 51:21.875
You want me to put this diaper on you?

51:22.916 --> 51:25.583
If you understand me, bark twice.

51:25.666 --> 51:26.791
[barks twice]

51:26.875 --> 51:27.750
Wow.

51:27.833 --> 51:30.333
Super. You're fine.

51:30.416 --> 51:32.416
[indistinct mumbling]

51:39.291 --> 51:41.041
He asked me to do this.

51:42.250 --> 51:44.041
[growling]

51:45.583 --> 51:49.041

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.458
You don't know this,
but my daughter, she's like a--

01:09:59.416 --> 01:10:02.250
-She's a really good soccer player.
-Of course I know that.

01:10:02.333 --> 01:10:06.166
You've shown everyone here, like,
no less than 1,000 videos of her playing.

01:10:06.708 --> 01:10:07.833
-I have?
-Yes.

01:10:08.375 --> 01:10:09.541
She's awesome.

01:10:09.625 --> 01:10:13.958
So I'm being a total control freak
by killing a huge opportunity for her

01:10:14.041 --> 01:10:16.833
to move away from home
and play with the national team.

01:10:16.916 --> 01:10:18.083
Jess.

01:10:18.750 --> 01:10:20.583
You're not being a control freak.

01:10:20.666 --> 01:10:23.166
You're just doing
what you think is best for CC.

01:10:23.250 --> 01:10:24.708
-Please.
-Jess.

01:10:25.541 --> 01:10:28.250
You're my boss, and you're my role model,

01:10:28.333 --> 01:10:31.500
and I'd be thrilled if I could manage
to balance work and family

01:10:31.583 --> 01:10:33.083
even as half as well as you can.

01:10:33.166 --> 01:10:35.208
But you've taught me
it comes with sacrifices.

01:10:35.291 --> 01:10:36.416
What sacrifices?

01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:39.333
I mean, not like sacrifices
because they're for your kids,

01:10:39.416 --> 01:10:41.041
and apparently, they're important.

01:10:41.125 --> 01:10:44.083
I wouldn't know.
I have hamsters. But, like, sacrifices.

01:10:44.833 --> 01:10:47.916
Like how you've told me, you haven't
taken a vacation in five years

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.291
so that you could pay
for CC's soccer camps.

01:10:51.208 --> 01:10:53.583
Or how you could've
had this promotion three years ago,

01:10:53.666 --> 01:10:55.375
but didn't want to miss her games.

01:10:55.458 --> 01:10:57.875
It's what makes you the best mom I know.

01:10:58.500 --> 01:11:00.041
We're gonna go in and kick ass,

01:11:00.125 --> 01:11:02.500
you, that beautiful tie,
and those yellow pants.

01:11:02.583 --> 01:11:04.375
Girl, you can pull anything off.

01:11:04.458 --> 01:11:05.333
CC.

01:11:05.416 --> 01:11:06.416
[soft music playing]

01:11:09.791 --> 01:11:10.875
I'm sorry, Mom.

01:11:10.958 --> 01:11:14.166
-No, no, CC, stop.
-I didn't understand how hard your job is.

01:11:14.833 --> 01:11:17.833
-And everything you do for our family.
-No, no, CC.

01:11:18.750 --> 01:11:20.125
I'm the one who's sorry.

01:11:20.208 --> 01:11:22.791
You were right, honey.
Your way works for you,

01:11:22.875 --> 01:11:25.416
and it doesn't have to be my way
to be a good way.

01:11:26.708 --> 01:11:29.583
More than anything in this entire world,

01:11:30.083 --> 01:11:32.000
I just want you to be okay.

01:11:32.083 --> 01:11:33.541
I will be okay

01:11:33.625 --> 01:11:37.125
'cause I have the best mom in the world,
and that's how she raised me.

01:11:37.208 --> 01:11:38.833
[both crying]

01:11:45.791 --> 01:11:47.208
-Mom…
-Hm.

01:11:49.166 --> 01:11:53.125
We are gonna W-A-L-K
out of here and crush this pitch.

01:11:53.708 --> 01:11:57.000
-Because Walkers never quit.
-Walkers never quit.

01:11:57.083 --> 01:11:57.958
Come on.

01:11:58.541 --> 01:12:01.500
Hey. Yo, one, two, three, four.

01:12:01.583 --> 01:12:04.333
Yo, Gabi. Yo, Gabi.

01:12:04.416 --> 01:12:05.833
Can you guys believe this?

01:12:05.916 --> 01:12:07.916
They seriously expect us to sit up here

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:11.041
and listen to Walker's band play music
instead of us.

01:12:11.125 --> 01:12:13.500
Didn't Mr. Walker
have a chance to play in Green Day?

01:12:13.583 --> 01:12:16.791
-I think it was Black Sabbath.
-It was a band about a color.

01:12:17.583 --> 01:12:21.666
Imagine giving up the opportunity
to be a rock star

01:12:22.583 --> 01:12:24.083
just to be Wyatt's dad.

01:12:24.166 --> 01:12:25.541
-Like--
-That's sad.

01:12:25.625 --> 01:12:28.666
-[boy 1] Like that's--
-[boy 2] I'd rather be the rock star.

01:12:28.750 --> 01:12:30.375
Mr. Molson, Mr. Hanes,

01:12:31.041 --> 01:12:34.916
thank you so much for giving me
the opportunity to speak with you again.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:35.958
You're safe today.

01:12:36.041 --> 01:12:38.208
-No dairy for breakfast.
-Okay.

01:12:38.291 --> 01:12:39.666
Let's cut through the stench

01:12:39.791 --> 01:12:43.625
and talk to you about our beautiful
building on 7th and Main.

01:12:43.708 --> 01:12:44.916
-That's right. Yup.
-Jess.

[Molson] Okay. Come on, guys.

01:12:57.375 --> 01:12:58.791
-All good?
-He's leaving again.

01:12:58.875 --> 01:12:59.791
[Mr. Molson] Um…

01:12:59.875 --> 01:13:03.250

But I'm proud to leave you
in the very capable hands of this team.

We want the show! Where's your guy?

-Just one more minute.
-I don't have a minute.

-Wyatt, where's your dad, man?
-I don't know, Lake. I can't find him.

01:13:38.625 --> 01:13:40.958

a synchronized swim band for this.

-[CC] Bill.

-Where's Wyatt?

about how you were in a band
that went on to be huge,

01:14:22.291 --> 01:14:24.750
but you had to settle for being my dad.

Maroon 6.

I mean, it's hard to accept
that your glory days are behind you,

01:15:01.833 --> 01:15:05.875
but would I trade
what I have now for anything?

01:15:06.666 --> 01:15:07.625
