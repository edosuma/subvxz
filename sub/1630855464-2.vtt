01:36.638 --> 01:38.849
What did you think
would happen to me, Gaal,

01:38.849 --> 01:42.895
when you so abruptly sundered
my consciousness from <i>the Raven</i>?

01:42.895 --> 01:45.606
What did you imagine would happen to me?

01:45.606 --> 01:50.527
That my thoughts would simply be suspended
as yours were while you cryoslept?

01:50.527 --> 01:53.530
Did it occur to you
that you would become my torturer?

01:54.114 --> 01:55.908
You didn't give it
a second's thought, did you?

01:56.909 --> 02:01.747
I was conscious the entire time!

02:01.747 --> 02:03.665
I didn't know, Hari.

02:04.374 --> 02:08.002
I'd just learned that Raych was dead, that
there was never a future for us--

02:08.002 --> 02:09.922
Take that up with Raych!

02:10.631 --> 02:15.928
He knew everything, Gaal. Everything.

02:16.470 --> 02:17.846
Hold on!

02:24.770 --> 02:27.606
Now is not the time
to air our grievances, Hari.

02:28.148 --> 02:30.609
I looked at the math.
The Plan's gone off course.

02:30.609 --> 02:33.820
- And why is the Plan off course, Gaal?
- I don't know.

02:33.820 --> 02:36.823
Don't you dare play the innocent
with me, Gaal.

02:36.823 --> 02:38.534
- What?
- You know damn well.

02:38.534 --> 02:43.580
My numbers were predicated on the creation
of a Second Foundation, remember?

02:44.164 --> 02:45.415
Second Foundation?

02:46.291 --> 02:49.336
- Who are you?
- I'm Salvor Hardin, Gaal's daughter.

02:49.878 --> 02:50.879
Daughter?

02:50.879 --> 02:52.256
You have a daughter?

02:54.174 --> 02:57.302
- The Plan-wrecker has a daughter!
- Yes. You know me.

02:57.302 --> 02:59.638
I was Warden of Terminus
when you stepped out of the Vault.

02:59.638 --> 03:02.057
Terminus? Terminus? I was on Terminus?

03:02.057 --> 03:05.102
Yes. No. No, you weren't.
He was. The other one.

03:05.102 --> 03:07.771
He doesn't know your mind.
You don't know his.

03:07.771 --> 03:10.232
His Foundation is hurtling
towards conflict.

03:10.232 --> 03:11.817
Empire will find him soon.

03:11.817 --> 03:16.530
- Wait. What are you talking about?
- War. Trantor, Terminus. Very soon now.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.282
What? We need to help them.

03:18.282 --> 03:20.701
- We need to warn them that--
- Yes! Good idea!

03:20.701 --> 03:24.204
That's what the Second Foundation
was meant to be doing, Gaal!

03:24.204 --> 03:26.081
Putting its thumb on the scale.

03:26.081 --> 03:27.457
Hari Seldon!

03:27.457 --> 03:29.209
You don't know me, but I know you.

03:29.710 --> 03:32.087
Your Second Foundation
doesn't stand a chance

03:32.087 --> 03:34.256
if we don't get this ship off-planet
right now!

03:34.256 --> 03:38.218
You're in the mainframe.
Clear our avionics fault. Help us.

03:41.096 --> 03:42.264
Hari!

03:47.811 --> 03:49.438
- He did it.
- What's going on?

03:51.857 --> 03:53.525
- He cleared the fault.
- We can leave?

03:53.525 --> 03:54.735
Shit. Almost.

03:54.735 --> 03:56.528
One of the stabilizers is jammed.

03:56.528 --> 03:58.280
Looks like
a bunch of coral grew inside it.

03:58.280 --> 04:00.073
I have to climb out and force it manually.

04:00.073 --> 04:03.952
When I tell you, "Fire the engines,"
you advance the throttle halfway.

04:06.121 --> 04:07.039
Okay.

04:39.905 --> 04:42.741
<i>Salvor, hurry.
The front's almost on top of us.</i>

04:42.741 --> 04:44.076
I'm almost there!

04:52.417 --> 04:55.462
Salvor, inside now!

05:17.359 --> 05:18.360
Yes!

05:49.933 --> 05:52.519
- Fire the engines! Don't wait for me!
- But--

05:52.519 --> 05:54.771
Fire the damn engines, Gaal!

05:54.771 --> 05:56.440
Fuck! Okay.

07:36.874 --> 07:38.375
Whoa!

07:39.042 --> 07:41.795
Beki. What's up?

07:42.963 --> 07:44.381
Can you smell the water?

07:53.682 --> 07:55.642
We'll bring this back for the Claric, hmm?

07:59.563 --> 08:02.107
What's wrong, Beki? You smell trouble?

08:14.620 --> 08:15.662
Oh, shit.

08:22.920 --> 08:25.005
Hell, Brother! That's like ice.

08:26.215 --> 08:29.218
- Go away. I'm sick.
- You're hungover.

08:31.762 --> 08:35.807
- And maybe still drunk. Give me your arm.
- No, no. Not again. Not again.

08:35.807 --> 08:37.934
No, not again. Not again!

08:40.729 --> 08:42.105
Curse you, Brother!

08:48.237 --> 08:49.571
Get it all out.

08:51.156 --> 08:52.324
Dear Seldon.

08:52.950 --> 08:54.993
Trousers. Put 'em on.

09:01.625 --> 09:03.502
Well, that was a productive purge,
wasn't it?

09:03.502 --> 09:05.796
Clean as a whistle, all the way through.

09:05.796 --> 09:07.798
- You're a demon.
- And you're detoxed.

09:07.798 --> 09:10.259
Give it a minute, and you'll be
perky enough to wipe your arse

09:10.259 --> 09:11.969
and greet the day with a smile.

09:13.136 --> 09:16.890
And I found a death threat,
if you're interested.

09:20.143 --> 09:21.061
Well,

09:21.061 --> 09:23.647
that's a fairly gruesome
message for the Foundation.

09:28.110 --> 09:29.319
Dagger's a bit of an overkill.

09:31.238 --> 09:33.532
Lightning hit the tree.
Was that their plan?

09:33.532 --> 09:35.659
Tie him up and get lightning to kill him?

09:35.659 --> 09:38.704
Oh, yes. That was very much their plan.

09:39.288 --> 09:42.124
It's been a century
since Empire pulled up stakes here,

09:42.124 --> 09:44.793
leaving nothing but bad feelings.

09:44.793 --> 09:48.922
And it seems the local taste
for off-worlders continues to sour.

09:48.922 --> 09:51.175
Claric Rees. I knew him.

09:52.009 --> 09:53.886
Good Magician. Sad eyes.

09:53.886 --> 09:56.638
I always felt
that I had to apologize for something.

09:56.638 --> 10:00.225
Killed for his beliefs in the teachings
of Hari Seldon, unfortunately.

10:00.225 --> 10:02.394
There's all flavors of people on Siwenna.

10:02.978 --> 10:05.564
Doesn't have to be the religious ones
who left this warning.

10:06.356 --> 10:09.401
The symbol of the local lightning deity.

10:09.401 --> 10:11.904
Someone feels like
they're being kicked in the gods.

10:11.904 --> 10:13.655
But they can keep their gods.

10:13.655 --> 10:17.075
We're just shining a light on
the great force that underlies everything.

10:17.075 --> 10:21.288
And illuminating a few corners
some would prefer to keep darkened.

10:21.288 --> 10:24.291
Faith is a funny thing, Brother.

10:31.798 --> 10:33.634
They mean to ambush us later, right?

10:33.634 --> 10:36.595
Without a doubt. Keep your aura charged.

10:36.595 --> 10:38.305
Not much use against lightning.

10:39.097 --> 10:40.182
Avoid lightning.

11:02.454 --> 11:05.457
Empress Hanlo, one of the greats.

11:06.250 --> 11:09.545
And this gangly child would go on
to become Empress Ammentic,

11:09.545 --> 11:11.630
arguably even greater.

11:11.630 --> 11:16.176
Their dynasty began 4,000 years ago
and ended two millennia later,

11:16.176 --> 11:18.220
far longer than our Cleonic age.

11:18.220 --> 11:20.180
It covered four times the area

11:20.180 --> 11:23.517
and oversaw a blossoming
of science and culture.

11:27.771 --> 11:30.107
I have the results
of Dusk and Dawn's memory audit.

11:30.983 --> 11:33.485
There is no record of contact
with the Blind Angels,

11:33.485 --> 11:36.280
nor with anyone else
outside their normal circles.

11:36.280 --> 11:38.657
So neither of my brothers
hired someone to kill me?

11:43.036 --> 11:45.247
What a low bar we've set these days.

11:45.247 --> 11:48.834
Or more precisely, they don't remember
hiring someone to kill you.

11:49.710 --> 11:51.170
Well, that's a loophole to close.

11:51.170 --> 11:53.463
Yes. I'll see to that.

11:55.299 --> 11:57.843
I've also edited the memories
of the medical staff.

11:57.843 --> 12:03.390
They'll have no recollection of having
seen either of us so compromised.

12:08.395 --> 12:09.813
Enemies in my home.

12:11.690 --> 12:14.526
Foundation poaching the Outer Reach.

12:16.320 --> 12:19.156
The Empire squirms in my grasp
like an angry cat,

12:19.156 --> 12:24.745
which makes me all the more determined
to solidify this marriage.

12:28.207 --> 12:31.710
To that end, I've found someone
to engage the Foundation.

12:31.710 --> 12:34.505
Fifteen years' experience
in the Superluminal Armada.

12:35.088 --> 12:36.590
A decade in Intelligence.

12:36.590 --> 12:39.885
- Oh, come on!
- Honest. Incorruptible.

12:39.885 --> 12:41.261
Bel Riose?

12:42.262 --> 12:44.431
- Absolutely not.
- He's the best man for the job.

12:44.431 --> 12:46.850
He retreated under fire
over the Lemul Cluster.

12:46.850 --> 12:48.852
He executed a flanking maneuver

12:48.852 --> 12:50.771
and won the encounter
with minimal loss of life.

12:50.771 --> 12:53.440
Immaterial. He disobeyed me.

12:53.440 --> 12:57.152
Your efforts to extinguish the Foundation
will suffer if you indulge your ego.

12:57.152 --> 13:01.156
Ego? Riose thinks he can disregard
the wishes of an emperor.

13:01.156 --> 13:03.408
Luck happened to be on his side one time!

13:03.408 --> 13:07.079
And his people, extolling him
as a hero for saving their lives,

13:07.079 --> 13:09.581
when what he's really done
is rupture military discipline.

13:09.581 --> 13:12.876
How long do they think the service
will feed them and bind up their wounds

13:12.876 --> 13:14.962
if obeying orders becomes optional?

13:14.962 --> 13:19.049
It's a step into chaos,
another symptom of void-fucked entropy

13:19.049 --> 13:21.927
as everything goes lurching off
into disorder

13:21.927 --> 13:24.388
and I'm left to scrabble around
like an infant,

13:24.388 --> 13:27.266
looking for pieces large enough to grasp.

13:30.435 --> 13:32.771
From the universe to an atom...

13:34.773 --> 13:37.901
it all just falls apart
in your own damn hands.

13:49.621 --> 13:52.249
How long did you expect
my outburst to last?

13:52.916 --> 13:55.878
A minute and a quarter.
You came in well under.

13:58.005 --> 13:59.423
Shall I speak with Riose?

14:02.843 --> 14:04.344
If he refuses...

14:06.263 --> 14:07.264
kill him.

14:34.208 --> 14:37.544
- Bel Riose?
- He's the ablest general we have.

14:37.544 --> 14:38.921
Yes, and he knows it.

14:38.921 --> 14:41.423
And if he's out to settle scores with you,
it will get volatile.

14:41.423 --> 14:43.675
His fleet is extremely loyal to him.

14:43.675 --> 14:45.594
He has no fleet. He's a prisoner.

14:45.594 --> 14:48.222
Well, perhaps he should remain one.

14:50.516 --> 14:51.350
And please.

14:53.727 --> 14:54.770
Forks down.

14:57.022 --> 14:58.607
As we begin again.

15:00.025 --> 15:03.570
Index finger below the tines.
Arc the forearm. Arc the forearm.

15:03.570 --> 15:07.866
As Prime, my brothers
would do well to follow my lead.

15:07.866 --> 15:11.245
Brother, your genetic match
to the Principium

15:11.245 --> 15:13.080
was off by three centimorgans.

15:13.080 --> 15:14.039
That's been corrected.

15:14.039 --> 15:16.750
DNA is easy. Habits are hard.

15:16.750 --> 15:18.752
We must present as one man.

15:18.752 --> 15:21.672
No matter how far you-- we have drifted.

15:21.672 --> 15:24.091
On the subject of Riose,

15:24.091 --> 15:28.136
I remember learning about a similar
difficulty faced by Emperor Daluben IV.

15:28.136 --> 15:30.055
There was a wildly charismatic general,
and he--

15:30.055 --> 15:33.016
Now I have a history instructor
as well as a movement coach.

15:34.017 --> 15:38.730
Yet another incentive for this marriage.
We don't ever have to do this again.

15:53.579 --> 15:56.832
So, the Second Foundation.

15:56.832 --> 15:58.917
Why did you keep Hari from starting it?

15:58.917 --> 16:00.127
I don't know.

16:02.421 --> 16:03.964
I loved your father.

16:04.548 --> 16:07.885
With Raych, I finally felt whole.

16:09.094 --> 16:10.762
And Hari ripped that away from me.

16:11.346 --> 16:12.806
I knew the Plan was important,

16:12.806 --> 16:16.059
but in the moment,
I couldn't separate the man from the math.

16:17.311 --> 16:20.022
And if you had,
you could've helped Terminus?

16:20.939 --> 16:22.399
It's more complicated than that.

16:22.399 --> 16:24.693
Hari doesn't tell you everything.
He never does.

16:24.693 --> 16:27.863
Give a girl a fish, she eats for a day.

16:30.991 --> 16:32.743
Teach a girl to fish...

16:33.702 --> 16:36.288
You've peered into
the Prime Radiant, Gaal.

16:36.288 --> 16:37.873
All the way to the end.

16:37.873 --> 16:41.126
The answers are there for you
if you care to work them out.

16:42.336 --> 16:47.216
We're not meant to interfere in the war
between Empire and Foundation,

16:47.216 --> 16:49.301
much as you might wish to.

16:49.301 --> 16:52.679
Well, you said the math was off course,
so let's fix it.

16:53.388 --> 16:54.932
I mean, they do need to win, don't they?

16:54.932 --> 16:59.353
We're decades from Terminus,
without a jumpship or access to a gate.

16:59.353 --> 17:00.604
And even if we had,

17:00.604 --> 17:03.649
- we wouldn't intervene directly.
- Why not?

17:03.649 --> 17:06.234
First Foundation needs to be
kept in the dark.

17:06.234 --> 17:10.196
Psychohistory predicts
the natural patterns of humanity.

17:10.781 --> 17:13.450
Introduce too much information
into the system,

17:13.450 --> 17:14.910
and you disturb it,

17:14.910 --> 17:17.538
which is why the system required
a counterpoint.

17:17.538 --> 17:18.872
A Second Foundation.

17:19.455 --> 17:22.084
Psychohistorians with access to the Plan.

17:22.709 --> 17:24.795
Knowledge of the future
applied judiciously

17:24.795 --> 17:28.507
and with intent to quietly adjust
the Empire's course.

17:28.507 --> 17:30.425
Or the First Foundation's, if needed.

17:30.425 --> 17:32.553
Now she gets it. Finally.

17:33.512 --> 17:35.347
You're talking like Terminus is the enemy.

17:35.347 --> 17:36.473
It isn't. Not yet.

17:36.473 --> 17:37.975
But power corrupts.

17:37.975 --> 17:41.520
And a Foundation left unchecked
becomes Empire all over again.

17:41.520 --> 17:44.815
They are good people.
You do not know them like I do.

17:44.815 --> 17:46.233
Everyone you knew there is dead.

17:47.651 --> 17:48.652
Nice.

17:49.236 --> 17:51.613
We lose, it's bad. We win, it's bad.

17:52.197 --> 17:54.575
I can't accept that.

17:55.158 --> 17:57.286
I don't know
if the Foundation can survive this crisis,

17:57.286 --> 17:59.580
but I know what's ahead.

18:00.914 --> 18:03.208
I know what all that red
in the Radiant is.

18:03.208 --> 18:05.961
You felt something. Another presentiment.

18:06.837 --> 18:08.130
Tell me.

18:08.839 --> 18:10.132
Despair.

18:11.216 --> 18:13.135
Death. Destruction.

18:14.970 --> 18:16.096
I did this.

18:17.055 --> 18:20.017
When I climbed out of the pool
and stumbled in on you and Raych,

18:20.017 --> 18:21.852
I threw the equations off course.

18:24.897 --> 18:28.025
But maybe those same instincts
can steer them back.

18:28.734 --> 18:30.569
I've felt stronger since Salvor arrived.

18:30.569 --> 18:33.822
Maybe it's her abilities,
an amplifying effect.

18:33.822 --> 18:36.158
Abilities? You feel the future as well?

18:36.158 --> 18:37.743
Not the future. The past.

18:37.743 --> 18:39.870
Just moments Gaal and Raych experienced.

18:40.746 --> 18:43.040
- Raych?
- Via the seed bank.

18:44.166 --> 18:46.001
If Salvor can access my memories,

18:46.001 --> 18:49.588
then maybe my premonitions
are the same thing in reverse.

18:49.588 --> 18:52.508
Memories my future self has experienced.

18:52.508 --> 18:56.261
Show me the turning point
where chaos seems to consume everything.

19:05.479 --> 19:06.605
Your turning point.

19:06.605 --> 19:09.274
How far into the future
would you say that is?

19:09.274 --> 19:11.985
Another 150 years?

19:11.985 --> 19:14.363
That's where you need to project
your consciousness, Gaal.

19:14.363 --> 19:16.156
That's where we find a new path.

19:16.156 --> 19:19.243
- I should be long dead by then.
- You slept through the last century.

19:19.243 --> 19:21.245
Who's to say
you don't sleep through the next?

19:33.423 --> 19:34.633
Dominion.

19:39.012 --> 19:41.390
Lady Demerzel, will you not dine with us?

19:41.390 --> 19:44.476
Thank you, Your Grace.
I'm more comfortable where I stand.

19:46.854 --> 19:47.855
Thank you.

19:49.273 --> 19:52.150
I've always been fascinated
by planetesimals.

19:52.150 --> 19:53.902
How many in your realm are populated?

19:53.902 --> 19:55.904
More than a thousand
in the Cloud Dominion.

19:55.904 --> 19:57.155
Many with unique features.

19:57.155 --> 19:59.741
We'll host a visit,
and you can come ice-running with me.

19:59.741 --> 20:01.994
There are mountains of methane ice
to play on.

20:01.994 --> 20:03.412
I'd enjoy that very much.

20:04.580 --> 20:06.373
Will you join us for ice-running,
Brother Day?

20:06.373 --> 20:09.751
Steel blades on combustible ice
at high speeds?

20:11.920 --> 20:15.716
We'll leave that to
foolish youngsters with flexible knees.

20:15.716 --> 20:16.758
Really?

20:16.758 --> 20:19.720
I mean, if need be,
can't you simply decant a new one of you

20:19.720 --> 20:20.971
and take their knees?

20:21.722 --> 20:22.598
Dominion.

20:22.598 --> 20:25.893
I'm sorry. Was that rude?
Aren't we to be family?

20:25.893 --> 20:28.312
Not rude at all. Curiosity is becoming.

20:28.312 --> 20:30.105
Well, I am fascinated.

20:30.105 --> 20:33.734
For example, if yesterday's
assassination attempt had succeeded,

20:34.401 --> 20:36.153
you'd be a new man now, wouldn't you?

20:36.153 --> 20:38.405
Would we even know? Would he know?

20:38.405 --> 20:39.740
How did you learn of the attempt?

20:39.740 --> 20:41.408
It was a only rumor
till you just confirmed it.

20:42.284 --> 20:44.203
There are many rumors
about Empire, you know.

20:44.203 --> 20:45.996
Some more frivolous than others.

20:45.996 --> 20:48.332
I've heard you don't lift your own forks.

20:48.957 --> 20:51.502
That the servants feed you like infants.

20:51.502 --> 20:55.672
Oh, please, Astrid,
come and hoist this quail

20:55.672 --> 20:57.549
and shove it into my mouth.

20:59.218 --> 21:02.554
Yeah, well, it must be nice
to have some surety of succession.

21:02.554 --> 21:05.390
If you marry me and rely on biology,
you'll lose that.

21:05.390 --> 21:08.143
With multiple children,
we'll have a different kind of surety.

21:08.143 --> 21:11.730
True. With enough children, even
a zeppelin crash needn't disrupt the line.

21:14.316 --> 21:15.901
We are very sorry for your losses.

21:18.862 --> 21:22.658
My oldest sister, the crown princess,
was trained in leadership.

21:22.658 --> 21:25.327
My brother was an officer
in the Royal Hussars.

21:25.327 --> 21:27.704
I was allowed to be a dilettante.

21:27.704 --> 21:31.500
Sport, art, music.

21:31.500 --> 21:36.421
Well, may we all be eternal students.

21:38.590 --> 21:41.468
Yes, it was a wonderful life
until the accident.

21:42.261 --> 21:46.056
Now, I am Dominion
with no education on how to rule.

21:46.056 --> 21:50.102
Our alliance will provide you
with all the support you could wish for.

21:51.395 --> 21:52.813
I see benefits to myself.

21:57.860 --> 21:59.403
But what of you, Brother Dawn?

22:00.988 --> 22:02.531
You'll lose a kingdom.

22:02.531 --> 22:04.116
But gain a sister.

22:04.783 --> 22:06.118
Is that what I'll be?

22:08.453 --> 22:09.538
And won't I be accomplishing

22:09.538 --> 22:11.832
what yesterday's attempt sought to do
but could not?

22:11.832 --> 22:13.584
A baby is born,

22:13.584 --> 22:15.836
and all the other branches
fall off the tree.

22:15.836 --> 22:19.298
Assassination by procreation.

22:20.841 --> 22:23.677
We're not branches. It's all one tree.

22:23.677 --> 22:25.053
We're the same man.

22:26.722 --> 22:29.516
But you would never become Day.

22:29.516 --> 22:31.935
Your very reason for existing
would be erased.

22:33.103 --> 22:35.105
She's gonna talk her way out of marriage.

22:35.105 --> 22:36.440
Not at all.

22:37.107 --> 22:40.068
She's displaying a fine mind for analysis.

22:40.068 --> 22:41.153
May I see them, Empire?

22:42.321 --> 22:44.239
The branches I'll be snipping off.

22:45.240 --> 22:46.283
The bodies in jars.

22:53.957 --> 22:57.252
I will escort you
to the Principium myself.

23:00.547 --> 23:03.550
And please, call me "Day."

23:15.187 --> 23:16.980
Dawn. Dusk.

23:32.412 --> 23:33.455
Cleon I.

23:33.455 --> 23:35.749
Somehow, I thought he'd be lying down.

23:36.333 --> 23:38.252
I wonder if he knew
how long he'd be on his feet.

23:39.711 --> 23:41.004
We could bring him a chair.

23:41.004 --> 23:43.757
I meant walking around inside you three.

23:44.883 --> 23:46.426
I'm not surprised he's worn out.

24:03.318 --> 24:06.029
- So, if you had died yesterday...
- No.

24:06.738 --> 24:08.824
- ...which one?
- It's this one.

24:10.909 --> 24:13.579
"Rejoice his shame remains unknown:

24:14.246 --> 24:17.708
that he had almost sat a throne."

24:17.708 --> 24:19.126
I don't know that poem.

24:21.003 --> 24:22.546
It's about an uprising.

24:23.672 --> 24:26.300
Empire banned it decades ago.
It's a crime to quote it.

24:29.428 --> 24:32.431
I only see Cleons.
Are the Demerzels kept separate?

24:32.431 --> 24:35.184
I assume
that's how she stays the same age.

24:35.184 --> 24:37.644
She has separate arrangements, yes.

24:38.645 --> 24:41.523
You can see my memories are transmitted
as I make them.

24:41.523 --> 24:43.650
We only edit them so he--

24:46.987 --> 24:49.031
so I wouldn't remember being killed.

24:49.615 --> 24:52.367
And he wouldn't know
he'd replaced another.

24:53.493 --> 24:55.370
A gift of mercy for your son.

24:55.954 --> 24:57.873
Or is that the wrong word?

24:57.873 --> 24:59.958
We call them exponents.

24:59.958 --> 25:04.087
It'll be easy to end them when there are
little footsteps in the palace.

25:04.755 --> 25:06.256
How will it be done?

25:06.256 --> 25:09.885
The tanks will be drained.
The decay harnessed as energy.

25:09.885 --> 25:11.595
Your scientists are efficient.

25:11.595 --> 25:13.430
Always. In fact, I have good news.

25:13.430 --> 25:17.267
I'm told there's little risk
of genetic disorder in our offspring.

25:17.267 --> 25:20.270
You tested me? How?

25:20.270 --> 25:22.314
Your drinking glass at dinner.

25:22.314 --> 25:25.526
I would've spat for your scientists
and eliminated a step.

25:27.319 --> 25:28.737
So, you're expecting intercourse?

25:31.365 --> 25:35.494
In the pre-Cleonic age,
Empress Ravenna thought it essential.

25:36.578 --> 25:41.583
And I think it's a good way
to create an emotional bond.

25:44.294 --> 25:48.048
She also fancied a public consummation,
but that seems cruel...

25:49.299 --> 25:50.592
to the public.

25:53.720 --> 25:55.556
My sterility can be reversed,

25:55.556 --> 25:58.809
but I suggest that our genetic material
be combined in a lab.

25:58.809 --> 26:00.853
If we have a selection of viable embryos,

26:00.853 --> 26:04.565
we can choose one
with a superior makeup for implantation.

26:04.565 --> 26:07.025
Once there are children
and this room is empty,

26:07.943 --> 26:09.570
assassins could strike again.

26:10.070 --> 26:13.073
Your child would rule,
but you would be gone.

26:13.073 --> 26:14.616
In killing the would-be assassins,

26:14.616 --> 26:17.077
you've left no way to tell
if whoever sent them will send more.

26:17.077 --> 26:20.497
They will be deterred
by yesterday's swift justice.

26:20.497 --> 26:21.582
Will they?

26:22.958 --> 26:25.961
Dominion asks why unrest exists
and addresses causes.

26:25.961 --> 26:28.172
You've had a lighter hand than ours.

26:28.172 --> 26:30.257
A well-trimmed vessel
only needs a light hand.

26:30.257 --> 26:32.467
- Dominion is small.
- Empire's shrinking.

26:32.467 --> 26:33.844
Empire is healthy.

26:33.844 --> 26:34.928
Is it?

26:36.680 --> 26:38.473
'Cause there are rumors, Day,

26:38.473 --> 26:43.228
that the integrity of your
hermetically sealed lineage

26:43.228 --> 26:45.105
was corrupted some time ago.

26:45.731 --> 26:48.400
Which would explain, I suppose,

26:48.400 --> 26:54.489
your interest
in my as-yet-unexploited womb.

27:23.393 --> 27:25.187
Hurry up, Claric.

27:33.695 --> 27:36.198
Hey! Come back here!

28:07.771 --> 28:08.856
Show tonight.

28:10.607 --> 28:11.608
Not much longer.

28:13.151 --> 28:15.445
Sit down if you want.
Too hot to be standing.

28:19.491 --> 28:20.659
Clear out!

28:23.453 --> 28:24.872
You gotta go, girl.

28:25.455 --> 28:26.999
The title is "Brother."

28:27.499 --> 28:30.085
Novice Claric Brother Constant
of the Foundation,

28:30.085 --> 28:32.379
from which all blessings are derived.

28:32.379 --> 28:34.798
Jori, shut her down.

28:38.927 --> 28:41.805
Holo sign. Intriguing, isn't it, Jori?

28:43.056 --> 28:44.850
Don't you wanna see the show, Jori?

28:45.434 --> 28:48.187
The sign says "sunset." It's full day.

28:49.021 --> 28:51.398
It'll be dark soon enough,
if the Prophet wills it.

28:53.192 --> 28:56.153
Can I ask,
what's that you have there, sirs?

28:58.030 --> 28:59.907
It's called handfast.

29:00.407 --> 29:03.243
We use it to restrain offenders.
It's consecrated.

29:03.243 --> 29:05.537
A sound philosophy, restraint.

29:06.121 --> 29:10.751
And one the Galactic Spirit fully tends
to embrace in our celebration tonight.

29:10.751 --> 29:13.253
Right. At sunset.

29:16.757 --> 29:20.344
The Galactic Spirit in the Foundation
can help raise your crop yields.

29:20.344 --> 29:23.555
Keep vermin out of the harvest.
Predict weather patterns.

29:23.555 --> 29:25.599
All things Empire stopped doing.

29:25.599 --> 29:27.976
We know how to do that.

29:29.186 --> 29:32.439
I predict lightning.
Hits a couple tall trees every night.

29:33.232 --> 29:35.567
All right. You've made your speech.

29:36.443 --> 29:37.444
Show's over.

29:38.570 --> 29:40.614
Show's over!

29:53.794 --> 29:56.713
Behold the Spirit's shield.

29:56.713 --> 29:59.466
She's got a field
like the other blasphemer.

29:59.466 --> 30:01.301
Go on. Take it.

30:02.219 --> 30:04.304
Spirit protects anyone who believes.

30:04.304 --> 30:07.891
Your Spirit didn't protect
the one we strung up.

30:07.891 --> 30:09.434
And he was bigger than you, so...

30:14.231 --> 30:15.315
Oh, shit.

30:17.985 --> 30:19.111
Claric.

30:28.412 --> 30:30.163
About bloody time, Claric.

30:30.163 --> 30:32.374
The Spirit is among us now.

30:36.920 --> 30:38.380
Trust the Spirit.

30:46.138 --> 30:48.390
Greetings, people of Siwenna.

30:54.938 --> 31:00.903
The Spirit has come to free you
from fruitless labor and petty tyranny.

31:00.903 --> 31:08.285
Go home, heretic! Go home, heretic!

31:08.285 --> 31:10.412
Go home, heretic!

31:10.412 --> 31:12.497
Go home, heret--

31:33.435 --> 31:34.937
He was heavier than I thought.

31:35.604 --> 31:39.191
I think it was these coins
he had in his pocket.

31:49.117 --> 31:53.539
Enlightenment, citizens.
There is no end what the Spirit can do.

31:53.539 --> 31:54.915
Don't take it from me.

31:54.915 --> 31:58.877
Ask your neighbors,
seven worlds in the Outer Reach,

31:58.877 --> 32:02.339
once in the crushing embrace of Empire!

32:02.339 --> 32:05.634
And then abandoned, as you are.

32:05.634 --> 32:10.889
Empire cast you off,
bringing you freedom but also poverty.

32:10.889 --> 32:14.351
It doesn't have to be like that.
Ask Konom.

32:14.351 --> 32:17.813
Ask Daribow and others who are now rich,

32:17.813 --> 32:21.775
rich with the words of Hari Seldon,
the First Prophet.

32:21.775 --> 32:23.986
Remember Hari Seldon.

32:23.986 --> 32:26.822
That's right. Remember.

32:26.822 --> 32:27.906
I do.

32:27.906 --> 32:31.410
I saw Hari Seldon with my own eyes...

32:31.410 --> 32:32.703
An eyewitness.

32:32.703 --> 32:35.622
...138 years ago.

32:35.622 --> 32:39.459
And nothing since compares to that moment.

32:43.797 --> 32:48.594
The Vault opened.
The Prophet emerged. He spoke.

32:48.594 --> 32:52.181
And those who heard his words
were forever changed.

32:52.181 --> 32:56.226
Gaze upon the mysteries of our faith.

32:57.019 --> 32:58.979
- What will they reveal?
- I want to know.

32:58.979 --> 33:00.981
- What was that, Brother?
- I want to know!

33:00.981 --> 33:02.816
She wants to know. Do you want to know?

33:02.816 --> 33:04.318
I wanna know!

33:04.318 --> 33:07.196
I want to know! I want to know!

33:07.196 --> 33:12.910
Do you want to hear the good news
about the coming galactic paradise?

33:13.785 --> 33:14.870
We want to hear!

33:14.870 --> 33:17.247
- We want to hear!
- Claric? Claric!

33:17.247 --> 33:18.707
We want to hear!

33:18.707 --> 33:21.835
- What the damnable fuck, Brother?
- We've got to get out of here, Poly.

33:33.639 --> 33:35.140
Never heard it do that before.

33:35.766 --> 33:38.810
Must be void-damn important
not to trust sub-ether comms.

33:47.402 --> 33:49.696
What? What?

33:51.448 --> 33:52.491
What?

33:52.491 --> 33:56.036
The Vault is awake.
We've been called back to Terminus.

33:56.036 --> 33:57.496
Well, that's wonderful news.

33:57.496 --> 34:01.458
This is what you want, isn't it?
The Prophet walking amongst us again.

34:01.458 --> 34:04.753
One of the worst punishments
is having your wish come true.

34:05.420 --> 34:08.757
The second coming of Seldon
means the Second Crisis.

34:16.223 --> 34:18.183
After Seldon left the first time,

34:19.851 --> 34:23.522
I was sure he'd be back
once a year or a decade.

34:25.399 --> 34:31.446
But when he didn't, I thought,
"On the hundredth anniversary, surely."

34:31.446 --> 34:32.531
But--

34:33.282 --> 34:37.119
And here we are telling people about
the Prophet who cares so much for us.

34:37.744 --> 34:41.665
Who lived on after death
to shepherd us through the darkness.

34:41.665 --> 34:43.250
Every time I preach now,

34:44.001 --> 34:47.838
I wonder if he's still--
is still invested in us.

34:47.838 --> 34:51.925
Course he is. I feel it. And you do too.

34:51.925 --> 34:54.386
When you tell the story
of your bearing witness to him,

34:54.386 --> 34:55.596
the light pours from you.

34:55.596 --> 34:57.054
That's flash powder, Brother.

34:57.931 --> 34:59.725
Flash powder and truth, Claric.

35:00.893 --> 35:01.810
I need a drink.

35:02.728 --> 35:04.313
That's why I'm navigating, sir.

35:05.480 --> 35:09.443
Already fired up neuro-drives.
Activating sleep patches.

35:10.360 --> 35:11.987
I'm about to engage auto-jump.

35:27.669 --> 35:31.256
"Death, despair, destruction."
That's what you said.

35:31.256 --> 35:35.469
This certainly looks the part.
Our turning point. Go there.

35:35.469 --> 35:38.597
I'm afraid if I go there,
I won't be able to find my way back.

35:38.597 --> 35:40.057
You need a lighthouse.

35:41.850 --> 35:44.102
When I'd slip into your memories,
or Raych's,

35:44.102 --> 35:46.480
Hugo's voice used to guide me back.

35:46.480 --> 35:48.106
Try listening for mine.

35:48.106 --> 35:51.235
- 150 years upstream?
- Why not?

36:00.494 --> 36:03.747
86,988,053.

36:06.124 --> 36:10.003
86,988,059.

36:10.003 --> 36:13.382
86,988,079...

36:20.681 --> 36:21.932
It won't work.

36:22.683 --> 36:23.851
The visions are unconscious, okay?

36:23.851 --> 36:26.645
I've always been asleep
or under stress. I--

36:28.272 --> 36:29.273
What?

36:29.273 --> 36:33.735
In Old Synnaxian, the word for "prophecy"
means "water takes them."

36:33.735 --> 36:35.445
Seers would submerge themselves.

36:35.445 --> 36:38.323
When they couldn't breathe,
their inner eyes opened.

36:38.323 --> 36:39.491
Wait, Gaal!

36:40.325 --> 36:41.159
<i>Warning.</i>

36:41.159 --> 36:42.995
- <i>Fire suppression activated.</i>
- Wait, what?

36:42.995 --> 36:44.705
<i>Venting all oxygen.</i>

36:48.458 --> 36:51.086
- What are you doing?
- She needs to drown, Salvor.

36:58.635 --> 37:00.596
Beggar! Emergency override.

37:00.596 --> 37:02.890
No! No.

38:05.118 --> 38:06.286
Gaal!

38:51.290 --> 38:53.125
All alone.

38:54.793 --> 38:56.420
Without your warriors.

38:57.838 --> 39:00.799
Where are your Mentalics, Gaal?

39:00.799 --> 39:03.218
Where is the Second Foundation?

39:08.557 --> 39:10.225
I can reach inside your mind.

39:10.893 --> 39:12.227
What's that I see?

39:12.811 --> 39:17.524
A younger self peeking out at me.

39:17.524 --> 39:22.112
Are you from the Age of Empire?

39:23.155 --> 39:27.075
Before Hober Mallow pierced its hide.

39:27.993 --> 39:28.994
Gaal!

39:30.913 --> 39:32.122
Gaal?

39:34.875 --> 39:36.460
Gaal! Gaal!

39:37.836 --> 39:40.672
Gaal. Gaal. Gaal.

39:42.966 --> 39:45.093
- Your throat.
- He was choking me.

39:45.093 --> 39:46.053
Who was?

39:46.053 --> 39:48.138
He calls himself the Mule.

39:49.473 --> 39:51.099
He's the source of the coming darkness.

39:51.099 --> 39:53.185
- He's like us.
- A telepath.

39:53.185 --> 39:54.436
Only more powerful.

39:54.436 --> 39:57.981
He knew I was watching him
from the past from now.

39:57.981 --> 40:00.526
He mentioned another name, Hober Mallow.

40:00.526 --> 40:01.985
Hober Mallow?

40:01.985 --> 40:03.487
What else did you see, Gaal?

40:04.404 --> 40:07.032
Most of the galaxy
had already fallen at the Mule's feet,

40:07.032 --> 40:09.284
but he wasn't satisfied.

40:09.284 --> 40:12.037
- He wanted...
- What? He wanted what?

40:13.080 --> 40:14.831
...the location of the Second Foundation.

40:14.831 --> 40:16.500
I knew it.

40:16.500 --> 40:19.044
He was prying it out of me.

40:20.045 --> 40:24.925
And when he looked into my mind,
I saw a glimpse inside his.

40:26.635 --> 40:28.136
There was so much hatred.

40:29.555 --> 40:31.431
Not just for me, but for everyone.

40:32.766 --> 40:34.935
He mentioned the word "Mentalics,"

40:35.936 --> 40:37.896
called them my warriors.

40:39.523 --> 40:41.859
He's afraid of the Second Foundation.

40:41.859 --> 40:44.736
Hari, he thinks they're the only thing
that can stop him.

40:45.320 --> 40:47.030
Then it can still exist.

40:48.240 --> 40:50.868
What was the location
the Mule was trying to pull out of you?

40:50.868 --> 40:52.286
It's there. Go on.

40:58.584 --> 41:00.794
"Ignatius"?

41:03.005 --> 41:05.632
No! Ignis.

41:06.216 --> 41:08.260
- That's a planet?
- I think so.

41:16.101 --> 41:17.186
Here it is.

41:18.228 --> 41:21.648
Orbits a neutron star. It's habitable.

41:22.482 --> 41:25.736
And it's close.
Just under a parsec from here.

41:29.156 --> 41:30.365
And I can hear--

41:30.365 --> 41:32.910
Hear isn't quite the right word, but...

41:35.037 --> 41:37.664
It's almost like someone's calling to us.
Can you hear that?

41:38.582 --> 41:39.583
No.

41:42.711 --> 41:43.545
Listen.

41:46.757 --> 41:47.758
Maybe.

41:48.926 --> 41:49.927
Yes.

41:50.594 --> 41:51.595
It feels right.

41:53.347 --> 41:55.599
It appears you've found us a new path.

42:17.579 --> 42:19.248
High Claric, welcome home.

42:19.248 --> 42:20.874
There's a claw in the hold.

42:20.874 --> 42:23.710
It's territorial,
so mind you leave her be.

42:34.388 --> 42:36.390
I'm so happy to see you, Pater.

42:36.390 --> 42:38.350
You got here fast.

42:39.101 --> 42:41.645
They told us you were preaching
in the Red Corridor.

42:43.397 --> 42:44.940
I like the mustache. It looks good.

42:46.817 --> 42:48.569
Everything's been crazy all day here.

42:49.111 --> 42:50.404
Wait till you see the Vault.

42:50.404 --> 42:52.698
And all of us together for it,
thank the Prophet.

42:53.866 --> 42:55.993
This portends war, doesn't it?

42:56.952 --> 43:00.080
There he is. The man of the moment.

43:03.667 --> 43:05.669
- Shall we?
- Have faith.

43:07.004 --> 43:08.755
Welcome back to Terminus.

43:09.298 --> 43:11.091
Yeah. Good to be back.

43:11.091 --> 43:14.720
Yeah. Nice to have you back
under such auspicious conditions.

43:20.434 --> 43:22.186
I convinced the Director to wait for you.

43:22.186 --> 43:25.397
He would deprive himself
of my sparkling wit and company?

43:25.397 --> 43:27.024
He used other words.

43:28.192 --> 43:29.860
But you had to be a part of this.

43:31.403 --> 43:34.406
Poly Verisof, the Holy Witness.

43:34.406 --> 43:38.285
The ten-year-old half-feral child
with a front-row seat to revelation.

43:38.285 --> 43:41.288
I don't know about the half-feral,
but I'm honored all the same.

43:41.872 --> 43:43.290
Go ahead, Warden Jaegger.

43:43.290 --> 43:47.628
When the Prophet emerges, I'm going to ask
to speak with him privately.

43:47.628 --> 43:49.588
That way, we won't have any surprises.

43:49.588 --> 43:52.925
- Where will I be?
- With the citizens, managing the crowd.

43:52.925 --> 43:55.260
I'll introduce you.
You can say a homily or something.

43:55.260 --> 43:59.723
You want me on crowd control?

43:59.723 --> 44:02.226
Hari Seldon is about to walk
out of his vault

44:02.226 --> 44:07.314
and take note of what's been done
in his name since the last time I saw him.

44:07.314 --> 44:09.942
If anyone speaks alone with him,
it should be me.

44:09.942 --> 44:11.860
My title alone ensures it.

44:11.860 --> 44:14.530
High Claric didn't exist
the last time Seldon appeared.

44:14.530 --> 44:16.573
The Church of the Galactic Spirit
didn't exist.

44:16.573 --> 44:18.867
The Foundation endorses
the church's missionary work,

44:18.867 --> 44:21.578
but it is ultimately just recruitment.

44:21.578 --> 44:22.913
Just recruitment?

44:22.913 --> 44:24.289
And we thank you for it.

44:24.289 --> 44:28.085
The impending war will be funded
because you sell salvation,

44:28.085 --> 44:29.962
and tricks and trinkets.

44:29.962 --> 44:34.716
I was against that approach, by the way.
I was against calling ourselves Magicians.

44:34.716 --> 44:39.513
We're supposed to offer them
a rational blueprint of a new society,

44:39.513 --> 44:42.766
not turn them into arms depots
and military bases.

44:42.766 --> 44:45.394
You've always closed your eyes
to the realities of war.

44:46.436 --> 44:48.939
When was the last time you visited
the church here

44:49.940 --> 44:51.942
to see the new technologies?

44:51.942 --> 44:55.654
Are they deadly?
No, wait, are they expensive?

44:55.654 --> 45:00.158
Are we going to tax our citizens more
to pay for them?

45:00.158 --> 45:01.660
Are you going to get a cut?

45:02.953 --> 45:07.040
Look at this place.
We might as well be on Trantor.

45:07.040 --> 45:11.128
Seldon was a teacher, not a trader.

45:11.128 --> 45:17.801
His mission was to shorten humankind's
slide into barbarism and ignorance.

45:17.801 --> 45:20.554
- Do you still believe in that?
- I believe in the Prophet.

45:20.554 --> 45:22.598
Yeah? Which way are you spelling it?

45:22.598 --> 45:25.267
You're not speaking with him, Poly.

45:25.267 --> 45:27.144
Then why bother calling me home?

45:28.020 --> 45:29.438
You're popular with the masses.

45:29.438 --> 45:31.857
I'm not some damn painting of a saint.

45:32.691 --> 45:35.611
I'm the last one alive
who saw him in person.

45:36.195 --> 45:39.198
And when he looks at
what's been done in his name,

45:39.198 --> 45:41.575
I'm the only one
who can explain it to him.

45:42.242 --> 45:43.744
You see it, Warden Jaegger?

45:43.744 --> 45:45.162
You want the truth?

45:46.371 --> 45:48.123
I can smell liquor on you.

45:48.832 --> 45:51.919
And your pupils, Vordaline dust maybe?

45:51.919 --> 45:53.420
Do I seem drunk?

45:54.046 --> 45:56.423
I want people next to me
with steady hands.

45:56.423 --> 45:58.634
I'd retire you
if I thought she'd stand for it.

45:58.634 --> 46:00.844
I shudder to think of her safety.

46:00.844 --> 46:02.304
You go too far, Sermak.

46:02.971 --> 46:05.349
Look, you guys have it out another time.

46:05.349 --> 46:06.934
The Vault's as ripe as a melon,

46:06.934 --> 46:09.811
and we can't risk another minute
for it to burst open without us.

46:11.146 --> 46:14.358
"You can say a homily." Fuck.

46:18.278 --> 46:21.031
My girl. I'm so glad you're back.

46:21.740 --> 46:23.575
Dad. Me too.

46:24.493 --> 46:26.995
I'm just so glad
I get to be with my whole family

46:26.995 --> 46:28.330
when we witness the Prophet.

46:29.706 --> 46:32.584
I have to oversee the final preparations.
I'll see you at the Vault.

46:39.174 --> 46:42.886
This is a mistake.
I can feel it in my bones.

47:16.378 --> 47:19.256
I never got to plant my flag here
when I was a boy.

47:44.072 --> 47:48.076
Hari Seldon,
if it please you to show yourself...

47:53.207 --> 47:57.169
Dr. Seldon, I walk behind you.

47:57.169 --> 48:01.715
To walk beside you for one step
would fulfill every dream.

48:05.093 --> 48:07.179
More than one step would be good too.

48:39.336 --> 48:41.797
Dr. Seldon. Hari Seldon!

48:43.507 --> 48:45.008
Maybe he wants us to enter.

48:46.969 --> 48:48.303
Shall I join you, sir?

48:52.683 --> 48:56.979
People of Terminus,
I am beyond proud today

48:56.979 --> 49:00.148
to bear the title "Warden of Terminus."

49:00.148 --> 49:04.278
The same title borne
by the great Salvor Hardin

49:04.278 --> 49:06.530
the last time this vault opened!

49:08.824 --> 49:14.830
There have been days
when the burden of the job, of her legacy,

49:15.831 --> 49:17.499
weighed heavy on me,

49:17.499 --> 49:20.419
but today makes it all worth it!

49:20.419 --> 49:25.591
Today, I will speak to the Prophet!
I will bring back his word!

49:25.591 --> 49:29.636
And then I will lead you all
whither he sends us!

49:29.636 --> 49:31.805
"Whither"? Jackass.

49:31.805 --> 49:34.057
He didn't even introduce me.

49:34.057 --> 49:38.854
Let me hear you
as I step boldly into the future!

49:59.875 --> 50:00.876
Hober Mallow.

50:02.836 --> 50:04.004
Hober Mallow.

50:05.255 --> 50:10.093
Hober Mallow! Hober Mallow! Hober Mallow!

50:10.719 --> 50:13.430
Get Hober Mallow!

50:28.987 --> 50:31.031
Who the heck is Hober Mallow?

50:31.990 --> 50:33.033
Shit.

51:01.061 --> 51:02.062
Gaal?

51:04.439 --> 51:05.440
Gaal?

51:24.501 --> 51:26.753
- Gaal?
- Maybe this is a mistake.

51:26.753 --> 51:29.047
Maybe we're playing
right into the Mule's hands.

51:30.966 --> 51:31.967
Why do you say that?

51:32.843 --> 51:34.386
I need to tell you something.

51:36.513 --> 51:38.098
You saw something else, didn't you?

51:38.891 --> 51:41.852
My vision of the Mule, I hid something.

51:43.312 --> 51:45.022
From you and Hari.

51:46.857 --> 51:48.692
<i>I was trying to escape him.</i>

51:51.486 --> 51:56.992
<i>There was ash everywhere.
The smell of human flesh burning.</i>

52:08.962 --> 52:11.840
He knocked me down, and I was stunned. I--

52:13.300 --> 52:14.468
I turned...

52:20.641 --> 52:22.392
I saw you lying next to me.

52:36.698 --> 52:38.075
You were dead.

52:39.117 --> 52:42.955
Salvor, you were dead.
