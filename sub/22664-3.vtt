WEBVTT

00:03.047 --> 00:04.589
Previously on Future Man...

00:04.590 --> 00:05.715
I hate to tell you this,

00:05.716 --> 00:07.300
but you might have
an unhealthy obsession

00:07.301 --> 00:09.177
- with this video game.
- No, I don't, Ray!

00:09.178 --> 00:10.553
That's enough, Dr. Camillo.

00:10.554 --> 00:12.013
I'm... I'm sorry, Dr. Kronish.

00:12.014 --> 00:13.139
If you want to keep working for me,

00:13.140 --> 00:14.974
I suggest less tongue-lashing

00:14.975 --> 00:16.309
and more urethra-swabbing.

00:16.309 --> 00:17.393
Now off you go, swab, swab.

00:17.394 --> 00:18.686
And there's nothing weird about

00:18.687 --> 00:19.854
living in your childhood home.

00:19.855 --> 00:21.981
This is my childhood home
and I live here.

00:21.982 --> 00:23.233
This is a Futterman house.

00:23.234 --> 00:24.609
We're not killing Kronish!

00:24.610 --> 00:26.569
The mission is to stop him
from getting herpes,

00:26.570 --> 00:28.071
prevent him from becoming a scientist,

00:28.072 --> 00:29.614
and then he never creates the cure.

00:29.615 --> 00:31.991
I won a dance-off.

00:31.992 --> 00:34.327
Black apple?

00:34.328 --> 00:35.411
I'm the savior.

00:40.876 --> 00:42.127
Fuck me.

00:44.000 --> 00:50.074

01:11.615 --> 01:12.699
Okay, we're clear.

01:12.700 --> 01:13.950
Is everyone here?

01:13.951 --> 01:15.410
Quick roll call.

01:15.411 --> 01:17.787
Cheetah, Mongoose,

01:17.788 --> 01:19.289
Falcon, Skunk,

01:19.290 --> 01:21.207
Eagle, Panther, Bear,

01:21.208 --> 01:23.710
Fox, Dolphin, Beetle,

01:23.711 --> 01:24.961
Ferret, Alligator,

01:24.962 --> 01:26.337
Hedgehog, Wasp,

01:26.338 --> 01:27.880
Dingo, Mouse,

01:27.881 --> 01:29.048
Weasel, Monkey,

01:29.049 --> 01:30.383
Gorilla, Lemur,

01:30.384 --> 01:31.634
Moose, Coyote,

01:31.635 --> 01:33.386
Worm, Mantis, Spider,

01:33.387 --> 01:34.887
Cougar, Muskrat, Hyena,

01:34.888 --> 01:36.806
Bison, Meerkat, Wildebeest,

01:36.807 --> 01:38.558
Boar, Porcupine, Bat,

01:38.559 --> 01:40.184
Hawk, Zebra, Gopher,

01:40.185 --> 01:41.728
Rabbit, and Wolf.

01:43.230 --> 01:44.605
Okay.

01:44.606 --> 01:46.899
Through this tunnel lies the TTD

01:46.900 --> 01:49.360
and a path to our savior.

01:49.361 --> 01:53.064
This is it. We're humanity's last hope.

01:53.699 --> 01:54.741
Even you, Worm.

01:56.452 --> 01:58.578
And guess what?

01:58.579 --> 02:01.622
When we get to 2017,

02:01.623 --> 02:04.834
it's time to share the sugar.

02:04.835 --> 02:07.003
- Woo!
- Yeah, yeah!

02:07.004 --> 02:09.631
You're God damn right
I brought it with me.

02:09.632 --> 02:12.467
We're slicing this bad boy into 45ths.

02:12.468 --> 02:13.843
All right, everybody.

02:13.844 --> 02:15.219
Follow me.

02:15.220 --> 02:16.429
Weapons hot.

02:16.430 --> 02:18.306
Wolf, you ready?

02:18.307 --> 02:20.391
Let's blow some shit up.

02:20.392 --> 02:22.018
On my lead.

02:22.019 --> 02:23.186
Resistance now!

02:23.187 --> 02:25.146
Resistance forever!

02:37.826 --> 02:39.118
Thermal wire.

02:40.371 --> 02:42.664
Diametric chloride.

02:42.665 --> 02:43.790
Run!

02:45.125 --> 02:46.459
Come on! No, no, no.

02:46.460 --> 02:47.960
That gas means death.

02:50.547 --> 02:51.547
Eagle!

02:57.680 --> 02:59.749
No!

03:04.395 --> 03:05.395
Run!

03:12.439 --> 03:13.443
I can't...

03:13.444 --> 03:15.863
God damn it, this zipper's, like...

03:15.864 --> 03:17.156
messed up.

03:17.157 --> 03:19.158
Can I get a little help?

03:19.159 --> 03:20.494
It's jammed.

03:22.496 --> 03:23.746
See? It's jammed.

03:23.747 --> 03:25.168
It's jammed.

03:25.169 --> 03:28.251
God damn it! It always happens to me.

03:45.352 --> 03:47.979
Why are we doing this,
don't you live here?

03:47.980 --> 03:49.814
Yes, I do live here,

03:49.815 --> 03:52.024
but I don't know if my parents
are downstairs or not

03:52.025 --> 03:55.069
so I have to go check.

03:55.070 --> 03:57.321
You guys just stay here,

03:57.322 --> 03:58.322
try not to make any noise,

03:58.323 --> 04:00.074
and then, don't touch anything.

04:02.703 --> 04:04.455
Where the fuck is my phone?

04:06.039 --> 04:07.039
Whoa.

04:07.040 --> 04:08.249
- Guys.
- Hi sweetie.

04:08.250 --> 04:11.377
I-I thought you were doing uh...
the-the beach cleanup today.

04:11.378 --> 04:13.004
We are, just forgot my poker.

04:13.005 --> 04:15.047
They like it when you bring
your own equipment.

04:15.048 --> 04:17.382
Check out my "poker face."

04:19.219 --> 04:21.305
Come on, son, that kills
down at the beach.

04:23.056 --> 04:26.976
What... why is there a gun on the wall?

04:26.977 --> 04:28.895
What do you mean,
we've always had a gun.

04:28.896 --> 04:30.438
This is a Futterman house.

04:31.399 --> 04:33.983
Are you okay, honey?

04:33.984 --> 04:35.067
We can cancel.

04:35.068 --> 04:36.068
No, no, no, no!

04:36.069 --> 04:38.404
No, I... I was just trying to remember

04:38.405 --> 04:40.698
when did you get that classy wall mount?

04:40.699 --> 04:42.366
That's the same one your grandpa put up.

04:42.367 --> 04:43.701
I just gave it a little oil.

04:43.702 --> 04:44.911
Grandpa was a gun guy?

04:44.912 --> 04:47.413
Hard not to be after
those hooligans broke in here

04:47.414 --> 04:48.748
the night of the moon landing.

04:48.749 --> 04:50.041
You know that story.

04:50.042 --> 04:51.125
Three of them.

04:51.126 --> 04:53.252
I'll never forget their faces.

04:53.253 --> 04:55.797
- You won't?
- Couple of little Latino fellas.

04:55.798 --> 04:56.798
Vagrants.

04:56.799 --> 04:58.174
Well, two of them were vagrants,

04:58.175 --> 05:00.009
third one was a child, scared,

05:00.010 --> 05:02.011
like he didn't want to be there.

05:02.012 --> 05:03.763
Anyway, right after that,
Grandpa went out

05:03.764 --> 05:06.474
and got the old Ithaca 37.

05:06.475 --> 05:08.476
Thank God we never had to use it.

05:08.477 --> 05:10.102
I'm not even sure how it works.

05:11.230 --> 05:12.396
Hope it's not loaded.

05:12.397 --> 05:14.106
Hey, we better get going.

05:14.107 --> 05:15.067
Um...

05:15.068 --> 05:17.568
Lamar, how long is it gonna take

05:17.569 --> 05:19.070
to get to Santa Monica Pier?

05:19.071 --> 05:21.002
The traffic is moderate.

05:21.003 --> 05:23.157
So I'm estimating 40 minutes.

05:23.158 --> 05:25.535
- Okay, thanks, Lamar.
- Lamar?

05:25.536 --> 05:26.911
Honey, you don't have to thank it.

05:26.912 --> 05:30.122
It's not an "it," it's Lamar Price.

05:30.123 --> 05:31.165
Oh no.

05:31.166 --> 05:34.001
Hey, Mom, can I see that for just a...

05:34.002 --> 05:35.127
Thank you.

05:37.631 --> 05:39.131
Blackapple?

05:39.132 --> 05:40.925
It's a Blapple.

05:40.926 --> 05:42.969
Only old people call it a Blackapple.

05:42.970 --> 05:44.136
You told us that.

05:45.138 --> 05:46.472
Fuck.

05:46.473 --> 05:47.807
That's where I left my phone.

05:47.808 --> 05:50.810
Honey, are you sure that you're okay?

05:50.811 --> 05:52.895
Yeah, yeah, I am, I'm fine.

05:52.896 --> 05:55.481
Um, you guys should probably get goin'.

05:55.482 --> 05:56.983
Let's go, honey, those sandy condoms

05:56.984 --> 05:58.317
aren't gonna pick themselves up.

05:58.318 --> 06:00.069
Nope, they're not... all right, bye!

06:00.070 --> 06:01.321
Bye!

06:03.699 --> 06:05.157
Well, we changed stuff,

06:05.158 --> 06:06.701
just not the stuff we want...

06:07.662 --> 06:09.871
Jesus fucking Christ!

06:09.872 --> 06:10.997
Hey, where are you goin'?

06:10.998 --> 06:12.331
Do you guys want some privacy?

06:12.332 --> 06:14.166
No, we're just chargin' up.

06:14.167 --> 06:15.835
This is just something
that people typically do

06:15.836 --> 06:17.044
in private.

06:17.045 --> 06:18.379
Why?

06:18.380 --> 06:20.047
Because you do it with someone

06:20.048 --> 06:22.341
who means something to you.

06:25.929 --> 06:27.138
- Don't stop.
- Okay,

06:27.139 --> 06:28.556
I'm just gonna try
and talk through this.

06:28.557 --> 06:32.894
Um, so basically we didn't stop
Kronish from getting herpes,

06:32.895 --> 06:35.021
however, we did change things.

06:35.022 --> 06:36.314
Talking major ripples.

06:36.315 --> 06:37.356
Ripples?

06:37.357 --> 06:38.441
Ripples, ripples.

06:38.442 --> 06:39.525
What we did in 1969

06:39.526 --> 06:41.152
has had an effect on the present day,

06:41.153 --> 06:43.487
like my dad now owns a gun,

06:43.488 --> 06:45.406
and is also a little bit racist

06:45.407 --> 06:47.742
and it's probably my fault

06:47.743 --> 06:49.410
that this is now called a blaptop.

06:53.582 --> 06:55.291
Can you please stop, please?

06:55.292 --> 06:57.877
I can't, I'm not fully charged yet.

06:57.878 --> 06:59.003
Charged for what?

06:59.004 --> 07:00.254
It's a standard operating procedure

07:00.255 --> 07:01.839
to release tension.

07:01.840 --> 07:04.759
Two micrometers down to the left.

07:04.760 --> 07:06.093
Nice work, soldier.

07:06.094 --> 07:09.722
Fully charged in three, two, one.

07:09.723 --> 07:13.392
Yeah, fuck yeah, soldier!

07:13.393 --> 07:15.436
That is how you perform!

07:15.437 --> 07:18.105
Yes, fuck yes!

07:21.860 --> 07:24.403
All right, tension released.

07:24.404 --> 07:26.739
Ready to kill.

07:26.740 --> 07:28.583
Kill, what?

07:28.617 --> 07:30.576
Kronish. It's our only option.

07:30.577 --> 07:33.788
We tried it your way and we failed.

07:33.789 --> 07:35.164
Miserably.

07:35.165 --> 07:36.916
No, no, no, no, you
can't murder Kronish,

07:36.917 --> 07:38.167
he hasn't done anything wrong yet.

07:38.168 --> 07:40.628
That's the whole point
of <i>Minority Report.</i>

07:40.629 --> 07:42.004
I'm unfamiliar with that report.

07:42.005 --> 07:45.341
Do you need to be reminded
of what's at stake here?

07:45.342 --> 07:47.259
He's the father of these mutants.

07:49.096 --> 07:51.681
How can you look at that
and not feel outrage?

07:51.682 --> 07:53.557
Also, why the fuck do you even have

07:53.558 --> 07:55.101
this tiny Biotic?

07:55.102 --> 07:56.936
This is one man versus
the fate of humanity.

07:56.937 --> 07:59.606
We're going to the lab
and we kill Kronish.

08:01.900 --> 08:04.527
Whoa, you... you need all of
that to kill one man?

08:04.528 --> 08:06.487
Well, obviously a lot of
other people are gonna die

08:06.488 --> 08:07.613
to get to that one man.

08:07.614 --> 08:08.656
Casualties of war.

08:08.657 --> 08:10.783
Better them than us.

08:10.784 --> 08:12.201
You know this is the only way.

08:12.202 --> 08:14.245
No, no, there has to be another way.

08:14.246 --> 08:16.122
These are not Biotics.

08:16.123 --> 08:18.791
These are people that I work with.

08:21.795 --> 08:23.003
Can you get us close to him?

08:24.005 --> 08:26.966
If you can isolate him,
then no one else has to get hurt.

08:31.555 --> 08:33.389
Sorry, being the savior doesn't mean

08:33.390 --> 08:34.557
you get to save everyone.

08:43.107 --> 08:44.817
Can you get us in the building?

08:44.818 --> 08:46.485
Not without creating a huge scene.

08:46.486 --> 08:47.820
And there's three layers of security.

08:47.821 --> 08:49.822
I've got a badge and I
can only get through two.

08:49.823 --> 08:50.990
Okay, then your job is simple.

08:50.991 --> 08:52.408
You just need to lure Kronish out there

08:52.409 --> 08:54.452
and then it's up to you
whether you watch us kill him.

08:54.453 --> 08:55.703
Oh, you should watch.

08:55.704 --> 08:58.289
We're gonna turn him
into a puddle of guts.

08:58.290 --> 09:00.708
Now go in there and make
the Resistance proud,

09:00.709 --> 09:02.001
Future Man.

09:07.007 --> 09:08.799
This is a bad plan, Tiger.

09:08.800 --> 09:11.552
I got enough sensor
mines to drop this building.

09:11.553 --> 09:13.179
Look how weak those defenses are.

09:13.180 --> 09:14.680
I mean, where's the moat?

09:14.681 --> 09:16.640
You see any radioactive alligators?

09:16.641 --> 09:19.685
- I don't.
- No, we need a confirmed kill.

09:19.686 --> 09:21.645
I didn't travel through time
to keep picking through

09:21.646 --> 09:23.397
piles of rubble for body parts.

09:23.398 --> 09:25.858
Now let's get into position.

09:25.859 --> 09:28.027
Future Man should be out in...

09:28.028 --> 09:29.528
less than three fingers.

09:29.529 --> 09:31.482
- Let's go.
- All right.

09:38.705 --> 09:39.747
Morning, Josh.

09:39.748 --> 09:40.957
Hey Carl, hey...

09:43.001 --> 09:45.294
Hey, wait, where... where's Ray?

09:45.295 --> 09:46.588
Who's Ray?

09:50.008 --> 09:51.884
Fuck, I made Ray disappear.

09:52.886 --> 09:54.386
God damn ripples.

10:10.570 --> 10:13.697
Um, can I help you?

10:13.698 --> 10:16.700
Yeah, is... is Kronish in there?

10:16.701 --> 10:19.954
Well, he's not in
Dr. Camillo's office, no.

10:19.955 --> 10:21.914
They're still at their
partners' breakfast.

10:23.250 --> 10:25.501
Partners, how the fuck did I do that?

10:25.502 --> 10:26.752
How did you do what?

10:26.753 --> 10:27.920
Sorry, are you okay?

10:27.921 --> 10:30.256
Yeah, it's just...

10:30.257 --> 10:32.550
uh, have you ever had one of those days

10:32.551 --> 10:36.470
where you wake up and the
whole world is recognizable,

10:36.471 --> 10:38.180
but also really different?

10:38.181 --> 10:40.808
Mm, you mean like in <i>Freaky Friday</i>

10:40.809 --> 10:42.351
or a <i>Matrix</i>-type situation?

10:42.352 --> 10:44.687
No, more like the end
of <i>Back to the Future.</i>

10:44.688 --> 10:48.440
Oh, so it's like an alternate reality.

10:48.441 --> 10:49.733
Your parents are super cool,

10:49.734 --> 10:51.694
and all of a sudden you have
this awesome new truck

10:51.695 --> 10:53.279
- in your garage?
- Sort of,

10:53.280 --> 10:56.490
or, like, Steve Jobs doesn't exist.

10:56.491 --> 10:57.616
Who?

10:57.617 --> 10:58.951
Exactly.

10:58.952 --> 11:00.995
Don't you think that movie,
like, really undersold

11:00.996 --> 11:01.996
how hard it would have been

11:01.997 --> 11:03.497
for Marty to come back to a life

11:03.498 --> 11:05.499
that he never lived?

11:05.500 --> 11:06.667
Huh.

11:06.668 --> 11:08.169
Guess I never thought
about it like that.

11:08.170 --> 11:11.297
I just really wanted
that Barbie Hoverport.

11:11.298 --> 11:12.298
Oh my God.

11:12.299 --> 11:13.299
Really wanted it.

11:13.300 --> 11:15.509
He would have to fake his way

11:15.510 --> 11:18.345
through every conversation
for the rest of his life.

11:18.346 --> 11:19.597
Well, lucky for you this is actually

11:19.598 --> 11:21.098
the first conversation
that we've ever had,

11:21.099 --> 11:23.809
so you don't have to fake
your way through this.

11:23.810 --> 11:24.977
Oh.

11:24.978 --> 11:26.562
Uh, yeah.

11:26.563 --> 11:30.441
Uh, I'm Josh, by the way.

11:30.442 --> 11:32.151
I know.

11:32.152 --> 11:33.694
- You do?
- Mm-hm.

11:33.695 --> 11:36.322
Please, Stu, I beg you,
don't make me do this.

11:36.323 --> 11:38.616
These... these focus groups
can be humiliating.

11:38.617 --> 11:41.035
Buck up, Elias,
it's good for the company.

11:41.036 --> 11:42.661
Unless you're not a company man.

11:42.662 --> 11:45.372
I am, Stu, but you know
I've never been a showman.

11:45.373 --> 11:48.375
I... I hate being
the center of attention.

11:48.376 --> 11:50.169
You're not gonna be
the center of attention.

11:50.170 --> 11:53.380
That little mini lasagna on your lip is.

11:53.381 --> 11:55.008
What are you looking at, butthead?

12:01.139 --> 12:02.640
There's your Biff.

12:02.641 --> 12:04.016
Uh, yeah.

12:04.017 --> 12:05.017
Dr. Kronish,

12:05.018 --> 12:09.021
can I ask you a question?

12:09.022 --> 12:13.192
How in the hell did you get herpes?

12:14.653 --> 12:17.196
Well, it started the night
of the moon landing.

12:17.197 --> 12:20.699
Being totally humiliated
after losing a dance-off,

12:20.700 --> 12:23.869
I was summarily
run out of my fraternity.

12:23.870 --> 12:25.663
I tried to regain my confidence

12:25.664 --> 12:27.790
by embarking on a sexual odyssey

12:27.791 --> 12:28.916
across several continents,

12:28.917 --> 12:30.459
and, well...

12:30.460 --> 12:31.752
countless partners.

12:33.588 --> 12:36.715
I'm pretty sure that's how I got herpes.

12:36.716 --> 12:38.592
Yeah.

12:38.593 --> 12:41.470
Um, Dr. Kronish, I, uh,

12:41.471 --> 12:44.390
I need to show you something outside.

12:44.391 --> 12:45.432
What is it?

12:46.893 --> 12:48.102
It's a surprise.

12:48.103 --> 12:49.770
Ooh, I love surprises.

12:49.771 --> 12:51.981
Great, you want to come with me?

12:51.982 --> 12:54.191
Uh, look, let me ask you something.

12:54.192 --> 12:55.943
Will it be chilly
where you're taking me?

12:58.196 --> 12:59.488
Pretty chilly.

12:59.489 --> 13:00.823
Will we be gone long?

13:03.368 --> 13:04.702
Yeah, a long time.

13:08.248 --> 13:09.581
Stop, stop what you're doing.

13:09.582 --> 13:10.958
I... I can't do this.

13:10.959 --> 13:13.210
Take... take off your coat.

13:13.211 --> 13:14.295
What's it gonna be?

13:14.296 --> 13:16.422
Your life is in danger, okay?

13:16.423 --> 13:18.132
So coat or no coat?

13:18.133 --> 13:19.591
No, listen to me, Dr. Kronish.

13:19.592 --> 13:21.593
There are people who want you dead.

13:21.594 --> 13:22.928
You have to get out of
here, you have to hide.

13:22.929 --> 13:25.139
I can't protect you.

13:25.140 --> 13:26.765
Oh, you're talking about

13:26.766 --> 13:29.601
those animal rights people.

13:29.602 --> 13:31.103
They've been after me for years.

13:31.104 --> 13:34.023
I must be nearing 20,000 death threats.

13:34.024 --> 13:35.190
Really?

13:35.191 --> 13:37.443
Do you have any idea
how many possums we kill

13:37.444 --> 13:40.029
at this facility annually?

13:40.030 --> 13:41.405
Staggering numbers.

13:41.406 --> 13:44.783
No, Dr. Kronish, this is much worse.

13:44.784 --> 13:46.618
These people are trained killers,

13:46.619 --> 13:48.621
and they don't like you,
and they don't like your research,

13:48.622 --> 13:49.663
and they'll do anything they can

13:49.664 --> 13:51.248
to prevent it from getting out there.

13:51.249 --> 13:52.624
You have to disappear.

13:52.625 --> 13:54.793
I could never do that, Futterman.

13:54.794 --> 13:56.712
My work is too important.

13:56.713 --> 13:58.464
What good is your work...

13:58.465 --> 13:59.631
if you're dead?

14:00.884 --> 14:02.968
I appreciate your concern.

14:02.969 --> 14:04.553
And if you're all that worried,

14:04.554 --> 14:07.639
um, ah!

14:07.640 --> 14:09.516
Call that number.

14:09.517 --> 14:12.144
They handle all my death threats.

14:12.145 --> 14:13.395
Ask for Carol.

14:24.949 --> 14:27.201
It's been, like, six and a half fingers.

14:27.202 --> 14:28.952
We both know the savior's not coming.

14:28.953 --> 14:30.496
Let's just blow up the building.

14:30.497 --> 14:32.206
No.

14:32.207 --> 14:33.916
We're gonna have to do this ourselves.

14:34.877 --> 14:36.168
Up close and personal.

14:36.169 --> 14:38.337
Okay everybody!
We're gonna go inside now for

14:38.338 --> 14:41.256
the focus group. So please
form a single file line right here.

14:41.257 --> 14:42.341
Ratpot.

14:49.599 --> 14:50.724
You.

14:50.725 --> 14:52.684
What is the nature of this formation?

14:52.685 --> 14:55.020
We're here for the focus group.

14:55.021 --> 14:57.106
Didn't you get one of these?

14:59.150 --> 15:00.651
Double ratpot.

15:00.652 --> 15:01.659
Kronish!

15:05.031 --> 15:06.323
Hey!

15:06.324 --> 15:07.950
Fleetwood Mac.

15:07.951 --> 15:09.493
Back of the line.

15:09.494 --> 15:10.869
You want to bleed, jester?

15:10.870 --> 15:13.580
- Hey, hey.
- Back of the line.

15:13.581 --> 15:14.873
Save it.

15:14.874 --> 15:16.668
Low profile.

15:18.837 --> 15:22.881
Oral, genital, even anal,

15:22.882 --> 15:24.216
they call it herpes simplex,

15:24.217 --> 15:27.261
but there's nothing simple about it.

15:30.306 --> 15:33.559
Um, I'm Dr. Elias Kronish,

15:33.560 --> 15:36.645
and I'm seeking the cure for you...

15:36.646 --> 15:38.148
and for me.

15:39.315 --> 15:41.859
Thoughts, feelings?

15:41.860 --> 15:43.277
That's the third one of these in a row.

15:43.278 --> 15:45.487
I can't take it anymore...
we're in the building,

15:45.488 --> 15:46.697
let's just go find the motherfucker

15:46.698 --> 15:47.739
- and kill him.
- No.

15:47.740 --> 15:49.741
Watching it made me uncomfortable,

15:49.742 --> 15:51.743
I think because he was uncomfortable.

15:51.744 --> 15:54.163
Kronish will be here, Cindy promised.

15:54.164 --> 15:55.622
I don't trust Cindy.

15:55.623 --> 15:58.959
She's smiling, but she has sad eyes.

15:58.960 --> 16:00.085
Oh yeah.

16:00.086 --> 16:02.337
Anyone else have
thoughts on Dr. Kronish?

16:02.338 --> 16:04.673
I despise him and
everything he stands for.

16:04.674 --> 16:07.384
That's the third time
you've said that, noted.

16:07.385 --> 16:09.678
I'd like him better if he died.

16:09.679 --> 16:10.762
Okay.

16:10.763 --> 16:13.182
Anyone else want to see Dr. Kronish die?

16:13.183 --> 16:15.184
Yes.

16:15.185 --> 16:16.436
Ah...

16:20.690 --> 16:21.900
Oh...

16:22.942 --> 16:24.276
Well...

16:24.277 --> 16:26.361
You said Kronish was gonna be here.

16:26.362 --> 16:27.362
Where is he, Cindy?

16:27.363 --> 16:30.616
Again, Dr. Kronish is very busy.

16:30.617 --> 16:32.659
Why don't we take a look at our next ad?

16:32.660 --> 16:33.827
Just want to say in advance,

16:33.828 --> 16:36.330
no possums were hurt
in the making of this.

16:38.958 --> 16:40.959
The sound you just heard

16:40.960 --> 16:43.003
is a possum ejaculating.

16:43.004 --> 16:44.922
Let's just blow up the fucking building.

16:44.923 --> 16:46.798
Take out Kronish
and the rest of this trash.

16:46.799 --> 16:51.094
Okay, I'm just gonna have
you all fill out this form.

16:51.095 --> 16:52.179
This is some fucking shit.

16:52.180 --> 16:53.430
You know, we're in the building,

16:53.431 --> 16:54.765
let's just go.

16:54.766 --> 16:57.143
- Brilliant idea, commander.
- Wolf.

16:57.144 --> 16:58.810
Oh, no, no, no.

16:58.811 --> 17:00.729
No one leaves.

17:00.730 --> 17:01.813
Really?

17:01.814 --> 17:03.815
You're gonna stop us, Cindy?

17:03.816 --> 17:05.025
You want to do that?

17:11.991 --> 17:13.157
Where did they go?

17:17.121 --> 17:18.329
Shit.

17:19.958 --> 17:21.540
- What happened?
- They promised they'd do

17:21.541 --> 17:25.963
a better job screening
who comes to these things.

17:25.964 --> 17:27.172
Oh no.

17:33.805 --> 17:35.514
Where'd they go?

17:35.515 --> 17:38.183
Get it out!

17:38.184 --> 17:39.351
Oh!

17:44.732 --> 17:45.732
- Ooh!
- Ooh!

17:45.733 --> 17:47.025
- Jeri.
- Josh.

17:47.026 --> 17:48.193
What... where are you going?

17:48.194 --> 17:49.903
Where are you going?

17:49.904 --> 17:51.989
I'm looking for two people.

17:51.990 --> 17:55.033
Yeah, so am I,
Dr. Smith and Dr. Apoyngo.

17:55.034 --> 17:56.410
Have they gone missing?

17:56.411 --> 17:58.870
Missing, no, they're
just late for a demo.

17:59.872 --> 18:01.123
Okay, they're on three, right?

18:01.124 --> 18:02.666
- Yeah.
- Okay.

18:02.667 --> 18:03.917
Oh, don't be dead, Apoyngo.

18:03.918 --> 18:05.961
Don't be dead, Apoyngo,
don't be dead, Apoyngo.

18:05.962 --> 18:07.379
Don't be dead, Apoyngo.

18:08.590 --> 18:10.591
Help! We're in here!

18:13.886 --> 18:15.596
What happened?

18:15.597 --> 18:16.638
Good to greet you.

18:16.639 --> 18:18.056
Good to greet you.

18:18.057 --> 18:19.057
Good to greet you.

18:19.058 --> 18:20.309
Good to greet you.

18:29.986 --> 18:31.987
Those whitecoats we stole
from don't have access

18:31.988 --> 18:33.155
to the inner sanctum.

18:33.156 --> 18:34.948
We'll find another way in.

18:37.493 --> 18:38.744
Dr. Wolf.

18:46.377 --> 18:48.295
I'm telling you, Kronish is upstairs.

18:48.296 --> 18:49.755
High value targets are always

18:49.756 --> 18:50.922
in the subterranean bunkers.

18:50.923 --> 18:52.341
I don't think it works that way here.

18:52.342 --> 18:54.259
It's not your job to think,

18:54.260 --> 18:56.553
it's your job to take orders from me.

18:56.554 --> 18:58.430
This place isn't built for defense.

18:58.431 --> 18:59.806
This is the first weapon I've seen,

18:59.807 --> 19:02.392
and it's mounted on
the wall for decoration.

19:02.393 --> 19:04.770
- Tiger, my instincts...
- Fuck your instincts.

19:04.771 --> 19:07.314
Valdor's Palace, where was Valdor?

19:07.315 --> 19:08.857
In the underground catacombs.

19:08.858 --> 19:11.526
Temple of Gooliga, where was Gooliga?

19:11.527 --> 19:12.944
In the Gooligorium.

19:12.945 --> 19:14.696
And where is that?

19:14.697 --> 19:16.448
By the earth's core.

19:16.449 --> 19:18.283
Doesn't get more underground than that,

19:18.284 --> 19:20.369
now does it, Wolfie?

19:20.370 --> 19:21.453
Jesus.

19:28.294 --> 19:30.128
Trust me.

19:30.129 --> 19:31.463
This is the way to Kronish.

19:41.641 --> 19:42.808
Oh, f...

19:42.809 --> 19:44.434
Goddammit.

19:44.435 --> 19:45.478
Wolf.

19:48.606 --> 19:50.023
You've been underestimating me

19:50.024 --> 19:52.150
since day fucking one.

19:52.151 --> 19:53.402
I have ideas,

19:53.403 --> 19:54.903
some of 'em are even good.

19:54.904 --> 19:56.321
I planned a mission

19:56.322 --> 19:57.447
and then it went sideways.

19:57.448 --> 19:58.490
Then it went upside down.

19:58.491 --> 19:59.616
I am flying blind,

19:59.617 --> 20:01.243
sideways, and upside down,

20:01.244 --> 20:02.786
so give me a fucking break.

20:02.787 --> 20:04.621
But you're not doin' it alone.

20:05.998 --> 20:08.083
When we busted through the Blood Gates,

20:08.084 --> 20:09.835
who was by your side?

20:11.212 --> 20:12.212
When they set us on fire

20:12.213 --> 20:14.756
in the Death Fields of Alamore,

20:14.757 --> 20:16.174
who found that sewage reservoir

20:16.175 --> 20:17.718
for us to jump into?

20:20.138 --> 20:22.013
When Cobra turned

20:22.014 --> 20:24.015
and tried to poison you in your sleep...

20:25.435 --> 20:27.227
...who pulled that
fuckin' traitor's head off?

20:27.228 --> 20:28.270
Mongoose.

20:29.355 --> 20:30.439
No.

20:32.024 --> 20:33.191
Wolf.

20:40.450 --> 20:42.701
I've given you my life

20:42.702 --> 20:44.995
because I trust you,

20:44.996 --> 20:46.913
and the least you can do
is just listen to me

20:46.914 --> 20:48.373
once in a while.

20:49.709 --> 20:50.876
Okay.

20:52.670 --> 20:54.337
What's our next move, soldier?

20:56.215 --> 20:58.216
So we blast back in there,

20:58.217 --> 21:00.469
find which office Kronish is in,

21:00.470 --> 21:02.429
post up on that roof,

21:02.430 --> 21:03.847
and take him out with a Sniper Sonic.

21:03.848 --> 21:05.515
The sound waves will pass
right through the glass

21:05.516 --> 21:07.225
and just pop his fuckin' head off.

21:07.226 --> 21:08.254
Nice and clean.

21:08.711 --> 21:12.272
All right. Three, two, one.

21:13.316 --> 21:14.691
Oh, God, don't shoot!

21:14.692 --> 21:15.984
- Fuckin' dick.
- What the fuck, buddy.

21:15.985 --> 21:17.652
What the fuck got into you people?

21:17.653 --> 21:18.737
Where's Kronish?

21:18.738 --> 21:20.405
You were supposed to be
here ten fingers ago.

21:20.406 --> 21:22.240
He doesn't have him... I knew it.

21:22.241 --> 21:23.283
Fuckin' aborted the mission.

21:23.284 --> 21:24.493
No, you don't know that.

21:24.494 --> 21:26.161
Maybe he just couldn't find him.

21:26.162 --> 21:28.163
No, yeah, Wolf's right,

21:28.164 --> 21:29.706
I... I aborted.

21:29.707 --> 21:31.333
- Goddammit, Future Man.
- God fucking...

21:31.334 --> 21:32.459
No!

21:32.460 --> 21:34.503
I... I got there in front of him,

21:34.504 --> 21:36.004
and I looked into his eyes, and...

21:36.005 --> 21:37.798
I just couldn't do it, okay?

21:37.799 --> 21:39.966
I'm not like you guys,
I'm not a murderer.

21:39.967 --> 21:41.843
We aren't murderers either.

21:41.844 --> 21:42.886
We're soldiers.

21:42.887 --> 21:44.679
You think we like killing people?

21:44.680 --> 21:46.431
- You sure seem to.
- Well, we don't.

21:46.432 --> 21:48.975
We kill because we have to,
not because we... we like it.

21:48.976 --> 21:50.228
Well...

21:51.521 --> 21:52.854
And it takes a toll, okay?

21:52.855 --> 21:55.106
I scream in my sleep.

21:55.107 --> 21:57.526
But our feelings don't matter
'cause we're on a mission,

21:57.527 --> 22:00.445
so unless you can give me
one strategic reason

22:00.446 --> 22:02.823
not to kill this man,

22:02.824 --> 22:03.949
we have no choice.

22:03.950 --> 22:05.826
Okay, what if... what if I went in there

22:05.827 --> 22:07.869
and talked to him, and I got you one?

22:07.870 --> 22:08.954
A reason not to kill him?

22:08.955 --> 22:10.789
You could do that?

22:10.790 --> 22:12.457
Yeah, I... I think so.

22:12.458 --> 22:15.502
Yeah, you could go in
there to the basement

22:15.503 --> 22:18.463
and find out what we need to know?

22:18.464 --> 22:20.715
Basement... he's... he's
in the top floor.

22:20.716 --> 22:22.926
Yes!

22:22.927 --> 22:24.135
- All right.
- Okay.

22:24.136 --> 22:25.470
- Okay.
- I'm on it.

22:25.471 --> 22:27.222
All right, we'll be
waiting for you, Future Man.

22:27.223 --> 22:28.474
Okay.

22:31.853 --> 22:33.311
What the fuck was that?

22:33.312 --> 22:34.312
I watch you sleep.

22:34.313 --> 22:35.981
You've never screamed once.

22:35.982 --> 22:37.274
I planted a tracker on him.

22:37.275 --> 22:38.817
He'll lead us right to Kronish.

22:41.612 --> 22:42.779
Dr. Kronish!

22:42.780 --> 22:45.156
You need to abandon
all of your research.

22:45.157 --> 22:46.992
What are you talking about?

22:46.993 --> 22:49.077
This is an historic day.

22:49.078 --> 22:50.412
You inspired me to do something

22:50.413 --> 22:52.831
I've been wanting to do for years.

22:52.832 --> 22:53.915
What did you do?

22:53.916 --> 22:55.625
You really got me thinking earlier.

22:55.626 --> 22:58.044
I may not be in
the assassin's crosshairs,

22:58.045 --> 22:59.337
but I'm not a young man.

22:59.338 --> 23:00.505
I could go any day.

23:00.506 --> 23:01.715
Danger's all around me.

23:01.716 --> 23:03.174
I don't understand.

23:03.175 --> 23:06.011
The cure for herpes shouldn't
be ours to profit from.

23:06.012 --> 23:08.096
It should be the world's to heal by.

23:08.097 --> 23:11.099
So, I've made all my research public,

23:11.100 --> 23:14.436
shared it with a global
network of colleagues.

23:14.437 --> 23:16.813
You put the cure out to the world?

23:16.814 --> 23:18.481
With the combined brainpower

23:18.482 --> 23:20.901
of the global scientific community,

23:20.902 --> 23:24.154
the cure for herpes
won't be my creation,

23:24.155 --> 23:25.572
it'll be all of ours.

23:25.573 --> 23:27.657
So strategically speaking,

23:27.658 --> 23:29.534
uh, if somebody wanted to stop the cure

23:29.535 --> 23:30.994
from ever existing,

23:30.995 --> 23:34.080
murdering you would have zero effect?

23:34.081 --> 23:36.958
The cure for herpes
would still get out there?

23:36.959 --> 23:39.419
A morbid way to put it, but yes.

23:39.420 --> 23:40.754
And thanks to you.

23:42.048 --> 23:44.925
Oh, well, the cure could
come from France, Nigeria,

23:44.926 --> 23:47.093
Spain, China, literally from anywhere.

23:48.596 --> 23:50.347
Oh, thank God.

23:50.348 --> 23:52.057
That's amazing news.

23:52.058 --> 23:54.517
- You get to live!
- Dr. Camillo won't be happy.

23:54.518 --> 23:56.853
I've, uh, I've given away

23:56.854 --> 23:59.064
quite a bit of proprietary material.

23:59.065 --> 24:00.732
But it feels good.

24:00.733 --> 24:02.734
For the first time in a long time,

24:02.735 --> 24:04.569
I feel alive!

24:14.288 --> 24:16.206
Future Man's trying to signal us.

24:16.207 --> 24:18.291
Signal to him to get out of the way.

24:19.669 --> 24:21.795
- What the fuck?
- Out of the fucking way.

24:23.506 --> 24:24.839
Fire a warning shot.

24:31.555 --> 24:32.597
- What the fuck?
- Oh, shit!

24:32.598 --> 24:34.265
- We gotta... here!
- That thing went...

24:34.266 --> 24:36.184
We can hide behind it, okay?

24:36.185 --> 24:37.227
What are you doing?

24:37.228 --> 24:38.561
What the fuck is he doing?

24:38.562 --> 24:40.271
Here, hide, go, go. Get behind this.

24:40.272 --> 24:42.357
Get behind this one.

24:42.358 --> 24:43.566
He protecting Kronish.

24:43.567 --> 24:44.734
You're gonna have to kill him too.

24:44.735 --> 24:46.111
I have to get you out
of this building, okay?

24:46.112 --> 24:47.195
What's going...

24:48.531 --> 24:49.781
Oh, shit!

24:51.590 --> 24:52.628
What are you...

24:52.629 --> 24:54.057
What the hell?

24:56.622 --> 24:58.289
Okay, you want to play games?

24:58.290 --> 25:00.208
What are you doing? Futterman!

25:00.209 --> 25:02.490
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- Switching to thermal.

25:04.721 --> 25:05.880
What the hell? Where are you...

25:05.881 --> 25:07.507
We have to get out of
here right now. Okay?

25:07.508 --> 25:09.217
I've got Kronish.

25:09.218 --> 25:10.844
Take the shot.

25:10.845 --> 25:11.845
Go, go, go!

25:11.846 --> 25:12.846
Get your hands off of me!

25:14.223 --> 25:16.516
Time to die, Dr. Death.

25:38.914 --> 25:40.832
- What the shit are you into?
- Go, go, go, go, go.

25:40.833 --> 25:42.167
What... what was that shit about?

25:42.168 --> 25:44.169
What the fuck were you thinking, Elias?

25:44.170 --> 25:45.420
- Do you know what you've done?
- Stu!

25:45.421 --> 25:47.005
You have buried this company.

25:47.006 --> 25:48.173
You have killed us all.

25:48.174 --> 25:49.716
Now, Stu, Stu,

25:49.717 --> 25:52.302
it was all about doing
right by humanity.

25:52.303 --> 25:53.762
- Fuck humanity.
- Okay, you know what?

25:53.763 --> 25:55.013
You guys just hash this out,

25:55.014 --> 25:56.306
stay away from windows, okay?

25:56.307 --> 25:57.557
All right, bye.

26:59.870 --> 27:02.580
What the fuck?

27:02.581 --> 27:03.748
Are those Biotics?

27:07.795 --> 27:08.920
Hey.

27:12.967 --> 27:14.259
Back stab!

27:15.178 --> 27:16.344
Reach around.

27:20.766 --> 27:21.850
Clear!

27:32.444 --> 27:34.028
Clear.

27:34.029 --> 27:36.447
What... what... what
are they doing here?

27:36.448 --> 27:38.950
It was only a matter of
time before they found us.

27:38.951 --> 27:40.118
Oh my God.

27:41.328 --> 27:43.997
Oh my God, they...
these are real life Biotics.

27:43.998 --> 27:45.874
They were Biotics.

27:46.876 --> 27:48.084
Oh...

27:48.085 --> 27:50.128
They're even more grosser in real life.

27:50.129 --> 27:51.963
Oh yeah.

27:51.964 --> 27:53.590
That's right, you've never seen one.

27:53.591 --> 27:55.967
- No.
- Up close and personal.

27:55.968 --> 27:57.302
- Yeah, well.
- Ugh.

27:57.303 --> 27:58.804
Take a look at this monster.

28:03.392 --> 28:04.726
Wait, that's Carl.

28:06.145 --> 28:07.645
He's a security guard here.

28:07.646 --> 28:10.565
Yeah, well, Carl's a fuckin' Biotic.

28:10.566 --> 28:11.774
But he's worked here for years.

28:11.775 --> 28:13.151
He's my Secret Santa.

28:13.152 --> 28:14.485
He gave me an iPod Shuffle.

28:14.486 --> 28:15.862
- He's human.
- Yeah.

28:15.863 --> 28:17.155
Biotics are human.

28:18.741 --> 28:20.158
See?

28:23.913 --> 28:26.164
But that... that's what's-her-name

28:26.165 --> 28:27.498
from Accounting.

28:27.499 --> 28:28.499
I know these people,

28:28.500 --> 28:29.542
I... I work with them.

28:29.543 --> 28:30.877
Of course you do.

28:30.878 --> 28:32.706
Biotics can be anybody.

28:32.796 --> 28:34.672
That's what makes this so fucked up.
