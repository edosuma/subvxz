02:46.813 --> 02:48.280
Well?

02:49.583 --> 02:50.948
lt don't look good.

02:51.117 --> 02:53.415
l know it don't look good.
That's why l brought her to you.

02:53.587 --> 02:55.782
So, what's wrong with her?

02:55.956 --> 02:57.082
What's always wrong with her.

02:57.257 --> 02:59.851
l mean,
she's not up to this kind of abuse.

03:00.026 --> 03:01.459
What abuse?

03:01.628 --> 03:04.722
All right, l drive her a little hard,
but it's not like l'm racing her anymore.

03:04.898 --> 03:07.765
Dylan, it doesn't matter.
l mean, you drive her every day, right?

03:08.635 --> 03:12.332
Well, l mean, for a '61 Porsche,
that's abuse.

03:13.073 --> 03:17.703
Dylan, we are looking here
at a delicate piece of machinery.

03:17.878 --> 03:20.813
l mean, it should be on blocks.

03:21.348 --> 03:23.748
At least covered at night.

03:23.917 --> 03:25.612
So, what are you saying?

03:27.120 --> 03:30.920
Look, Dylan,
if you wanna keep driving this car,

03:31.091 --> 03:34.925
then you better start driving
another car, an everyday car,

03:35.095 --> 03:36.858
and save this baby for weekends.

03:41.668 --> 03:43.431
David, come on, we're going.

03:43.937 --> 03:46.667
Kelly, come on, l don't wanna be
late to my Art History class again.

03:46.840 --> 03:50.003
- Have you seen my keys?
- Yeah. Keys.

03:50.176 --> 03:52.667
Got them. Let's go.

03:53.880 --> 03:57.008
l'll be lucky if l get there
by the end of the class.

03:59.152 --> 04:00.983
Hello?

04:01.154 --> 04:03.452
Yeah, okay, let me check.

04:03.623 --> 04:05.853
lt's John Sears. You want me
to tell him you're not here?

04:06.026 --> 04:07.926
No. Hello?

04:08.094 --> 04:10.688
l've been waiting all night long
to hear the sound of that voice.

04:10.864 --> 04:12.297
What are you doing calling so early?

04:12.465 --> 04:14.456
l thought upperclassmen
didn't have morning classes.

04:14.634 --> 04:15.658
Tell him we're late.

04:15.835 --> 04:19.498
- Go get David up and we'll go.
- David, get up!

04:19.673 --> 04:20.697
Where were we?

04:20.874 --> 04:21.966
l think we were at the point

04:22.142 --> 04:24.736
where l was about
to invite you out to breakfast.

04:25.378 --> 04:26.868
l really have to go to school.

04:27.047 --> 04:28.446
Wait, wait, wait.

04:28.615 --> 04:30.742
Kelly, you're breaking my heart.

04:31.351 --> 04:33.216
l'll talk to you later.

04:34.087 --> 04:35.554
All right, let's go.

04:35.722 --> 04:36.916
Well, wait, what did he want?

04:37.090 --> 04:38.580
He wanted to talk to me.
ls that okay?

04:38.758 --> 04:39.986
Fine. David!

04:40.160 --> 04:42.185
All right already.
Gosh, give me a break.

04:42.362 --> 04:44.922
l didn't get home from the radio station
till 6 in the morning.

04:45.098 --> 04:47.896
Well, hurry up, or you're gonna be late
for your class once again.

04:48.068 --> 04:50.263
You guys go ahead.
l don't think l'm going today.

04:50.437 --> 04:52.632
- Again?
- Look, l just woke up, all right?

04:53.039 --> 04:55.166
Fine, if you're gonna stay home,
clean up the bathroom.

04:55.342 --> 04:57.902
And don't sit on the couch
and watch TV all day, okay?

04:58.078 --> 04:59.511
Oh, wouldn't dream of it, Mom.

05:13.660 --> 05:16.686
No problem.
l'll get those contracts out to you today.

05:16.863 --> 05:18.888
Okay, thank you, Mr. Hale.

05:19.799 --> 05:20.823
- Here.
- Oh, thanks.

05:21.001 --> 05:23.094
- Hello.
- Hi. May l help you?

05:23.269 --> 05:25.294
Yes, you may. l'm Lawrence Carson.

05:25.472 --> 05:28.771
Mr. Walsh is expecting you.
Your 2:30 is here.

05:28.942 --> 05:32.605
Can l get you anything?
Some coffee, tea, anything?

05:32.779 --> 05:34.303
No, thank you.

05:34.481 --> 05:36.745
Tell me,
you been working here long?

05:36.916 --> 05:38.884
No, why?
Do l seem completely overwhelmed?

05:39.052 --> 05:42.852
Not at all. On the contrary,
you seem very well acclimated.

05:43.023 --> 05:44.718
Thank you.

05:45.425 --> 05:47.393
Lawrence, hi. Come on in.

05:47.560 --> 05:49.118
l see you've already
met my daughter.

05:49.295 --> 05:51.889
Your daughter?
Now, she never mentioned that.

05:52.065 --> 05:54.090
Brenda, this is Lawrence Carson.

05:54.267 --> 05:55.757
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

05:55.935 --> 05:58.062
- Brenda owes you a great debt, Larry.
- How so?

05:58.238 --> 06:00.138
Well, if you hadn't built
the West Beverly Plaza,

06:00.306 --> 06:02.399
Brenda would have no place to shop.

06:02.575 --> 06:04.440
Sounds like the debt is all mine.

06:04.611 --> 06:06.545
Don't you two
have a business meeting?

06:06.713 --> 06:07.737
Hold all calls.

06:07.914 --> 06:10.610
- Nice meeting you, Brenda.
- Nice meeting you.

06:13.119 --> 06:14.245
- Dylan, hi.
- Hey, Bren.

06:14.421 --> 06:16.412
Listen, Jim,
can l see you for a minute?

06:16.589 --> 06:17.817
About to start a meeting.

06:17.991 --> 06:20.926
lt's no problem.
Give me a chance to call my office.

06:21.094 --> 06:23.358
- You sure?
- Sure. Yeah.

06:24.397 --> 06:25.955
Thank you.

06:29.402 --> 06:31.427
Okay, what's so important?

06:31.604 --> 06:34.368
Well, Jim, it's my Porsche.

06:34.541 --> 06:36.634
lt just can't handle this L.A. lifestyle.

06:36.810 --> 06:39.335
The fact of the matter is,
if l don't put her up on blocks today,

06:39.512 --> 06:42.345
there simply may not be a tomorrow.

06:42.515 --> 06:44.540
So the bottom line is,
you wanna buy a car?

06:44.718 --> 06:46.948
l thought l'd run it by you first
before l wrote a check.

06:47.120 --> 06:48.610
What exactly did you have in mind?

06:48.788 --> 06:49.812
Oh, l don't know.

06:49.989 --> 06:52.321
Just, you know, an old beater,
something to drive around in.

06:53.760 --> 06:57.161
All right. Pick out something sensible
and l'll make sure you're covered.

06:57.330 --> 06:58.695
Great.

06:59.299 --> 07:01.824
l understand how you feel.
When l was in college,

07:02.001 --> 07:05.198
l had this awesome
racing-green Triumph Spitfire.

07:05.371 --> 07:06.395
Oh, yeah.

07:06.573 --> 07:10.270
l wish l had that car now,
but l ran it into the ground.

07:10.443 --> 07:13.469
Did you say Triumph Spitfire?

07:13.646 --> 07:16.012
Hey, don't rank on my Spitfire.
Might change my mind.

07:16.182 --> 07:18.582
Okay. All right, l'm out of here.

07:28.728 --> 07:30.093
lt's 20 to 1 1 , Sanders.

07:30.263 --> 07:31.958
You're losing your touch,
it's sad to see.

07:32.132 --> 07:33.497
Shut up and serve the ball, okay?

07:33.666 --> 07:35.497
This is our last game.
l gotta get out of here.

07:35.668 --> 07:37.863
What's the matter?
You can't handle the pressure?

07:38.404 --> 07:40.099
Pressure? l eat pressure, okay, pal?

07:40.273 --> 07:41.900
Look, today just happens
to be Wednesday.

07:42.075 --> 07:44.771
And on Wednesday, we have
our KEG House chapter meeting.

07:44.944 --> 07:46.036
Well, excuse me, then.

07:46.212 --> 07:49.147
We have our chapter meeting too.
We get our first pledge assignments.

07:50.049 --> 07:52.984
- That sounds like gobs of fun.
- Now you sound like Dylan.

07:53.153 --> 07:55.519
Or David, Mr. Couch Potato.

07:58.291 --> 07:59.315
Yes, folks.

07:59.692 --> 08:03.389
Once again, Brandon Walsh
tastes the thrill of victory

08:03.563 --> 08:05.724
and Steve Sanders
feels the agony of defeat.

08:05.899 --> 08:08.094
Tell us, Steve,
any words for our viewers at home?

08:08.268 --> 08:10.361
Yeah, Brandon. Shove it.

08:10.537 --> 08:11.799
Shove it?

08:12.272 --> 08:13.705
How mean.

08:13.873 --> 08:15.306
Whoa, hey, hey, wait a minute.

08:15.475 --> 08:17.375
Wait a minute.
No challenges for the victor?

08:17.544 --> 08:20.035
No. lf you're a minute late
to this meeting, bigtime demerits.

08:20.213 --> 08:21.407
Oh, well, you better hurry up.

08:21.581 --> 08:24.516
l certainly don't wanna be
responsible for any demerits.

08:24.684 --> 08:26.515
Goodbye, Brandon.

08:28.354 --> 08:31.016
- We're gonna do this again.
- l'll kill you, man. Get out of here.

08:31.191 --> 08:32.749
Yeah.

08:38.865 --> 08:40.525
- Hey, Andrea.
- Brandon.

08:40.700 --> 08:41.996
Wanna go get something to eat?

08:42.168 --> 08:44.227
Well, l'm sort of busy.
You know, studying and stuff.

08:44.404 --> 08:46.031
Well, we could study together.

08:46.206 --> 08:50.734
Actually, l have to meet somebody
from the dorms.

08:51.110 --> 08:53.271
Okay. l guess l'll see you
tomorrow or something.

08:53.446 --> 08:56.381
- Great. See you.
- See you.

08:56.549 --> 08:58.016
Hey.

09:04.958 --> 09:07.392
Okay, people, come on,
let's try to keep it together.

09:07.560 --> 09:10.723
We only have a couple more items
on the agenda.

09:10.897 --> 09:13.331
Now, the Downey House
clothing drive.

09:13.499 --> 09:16.832
The KEG House and the Alphas
have worked our usual magic.

09:17.003 --> 09:19.528
l need a bunch of pledges
to bag clothes tonight

09:19.706 --> 09:22.504
and one to drive down
to the Downey House tomorrow.

09:22.675 --> 09:24.973
So who are my baggers?

09:25.144 --> 09:26.634
Oh, great, great.

09:26.813 --> 09:30.112
Okay, Kelly,
you're not down for anything.

09:30.283 --> 09:32.046
How about you drive the van
tomorrow morning?

09:32.218 --> 09:33.480
l don't know how to drive a van.

09:33.653 --> 09:35.484
Don't worry.
One of the KEG pledges will drive.

09:35.655 --> 09:38.818
You just need to go along and keep
him company and help unload.

09:38.992 --> 09:40.220
Great.

09:40.393 --> 09:43.726
And the van leaves at 6 a.m.,
so, Kelly, don't be late.

09:44.163 --> 09:46.358
Yeah, don't be late.

09:49.035 --> 09:51.469
Well, Faulkner demands
a little more imagination

09:51.638 --> 09:53.265
than freshmen are willing to give.

09:53.439 --> 09:55.964
Oh, so you're saying that we freshman
are just old fuddy-duddies?

09:56.142 --> 09:57.973
l'm not saying that, l'm just saying

09:58.144 --> 10:01.011
let your mind
be a little less literal, that's all.

10:01.648 --> 10:03.741
l'm trying to be a little less literal.

10:04.284 --> 10:07.151
l know, l know. Believe me,
you're an endless surprise.

10:07.687 --> 10:10.451
l bet you say that to all your students,
Professor Rubin.

10:10.623 --> 10:14.559
Oh, no, don't call me professor,
it makes me sound so ancient.

10:14.727 --> 10:17.059
Besides, l'm only
your teaching assistant during class.

10:17.230 --> 10:18.788
And...

10:20.333 --> 10:21.857
...we're not in class now.

10:23.703 --> 10:26.763
No, we're not.

10:28.574 --> 10:30.974
What would you say if l kissed you?

10:32.979 --> 10:39.111
l would say that this is
neither the time nor place.

10:39.285 --> 10:40.912
What if it was a different place?

10:42.355 --> 10:44.050
What if we went back to the dorms?

10:49.162 --> 10:51.562
- Dan.
- Yeah?

10:52.298 --> 10:54.960
- Do you have...?
- What? Do l what?

10:55.134 --> 10:58.592
Do you have--?
Do you have protection?

10:59.172 --> 11:01.766
Yes, of course, don't worry.

11:01.941 --> 11:03.841
That's taken care of.

11:07.647 --> 11:09.615
There's something else.

11:10.283 --> 11:12.649
lt's okay, l've been tested.

11:13.052 --> 11:15.350
That's good. But l--

11:16.622 --> 11:18.886
Dan, there's something
l have to tell you.

11:19.058 --> 11:21.322
What? What do you have to tell me?

11:23.730 --> 11:25.630
l'm a virgin.

11:25.798 --> 11:28.767
l just thought
that was important information.

11:30.903 --> 11:32.734
lt's an incredible turn-off, isn't it?

11:32.905 --> 11:34.099
No, of course not.

11:34.607 --> 11:35.631
Not at all.

11:36.042 --> 11:38.510
l love the idea that you would
want me to be your first, but...

11:39.212 --> 11:40.372
But what?

11:40.546 --> 11:43.174
Your first time, it should be...

11:44.851 --> 11:47.081
...something truly special.

11:48.788 --> 11:52.622
- And this isn't special enough?
- No, it is. lt's very special.

11:53.259 --> 11:54.692
But we just met.

11:56.062 --> 12:00.123
And as a gentleman
and all-around good guy,

12:00.299 --> 12:01.789
there are rules about stuff like this.

12:01.968 --> 12:03.936
You know, it's not a problem.
l mean, l want to.

12:04.103 --> 12:05.127
No, l know, but...

12:05.605 --> 12:09.507
Let's both go take cold showers
and collect our thoughts, okay?

12:09.675 --> 12:11.905
There's plenty of time for this.

12:12.412 --> 12:14.437
Okay.

12:22.255 --> 12:24.849
Hi, honey.
We were worried about you.

12:25.024 --> 12:26.150
Why?

12:26.325 --> 12:29.021
Well, you told us you'd call if you
weren't gonna be home for dinner.

12:29.195 --> 12:30.287
Oh, l'm sorry.

12:30.463 --> 12:32.624
But l really wouldn't waste your time
worrying about me.

12:32.799 --> 12:34.289
l mean, l live like a nun.

12:34.467 --> 12:38.494
Between work and school, l'll be lucky
if l have one date this entire year.

12:38.671 --> 12:41.003
Somehow l think
that's a slight exaggeration.

12:41.174 --> 12:42.698
No, it isn't, Mom.

12:42.875 --> 12:45.241
l mean, seriously.
l go to school in the mornings,

12:45.411 --> 12:48.403
l work in the afternoon
and l study at night.

12:48.581 --> 12:50.708
l'll be lucky if l even get
the chance to meet someone.

12:50.883 --> 12:52.316
Well, you are kind of picky, honey.

12:52.485 --> 12:55.818
Okay, maybe l'm a little picky,
but l am willing to lower my standards.

12:55.988 --> 12:57.353
- Really?
- Sure.

12:57.757 --> 12:58.781
A little.

13:00.860 --> 13:02.623
Well, forgive me
for being the matchmaker,

13:02.795 --> 13:05.457
but your mother and l were talking
and we might have an answer.

13:05.898 --> 13:07.024
What does that mean?

13:07.366 --> 13:10.358
l hear you made quite an impression
on Larry Carson today.

13:10.536 --> 13:12.504
Well, l think he's a little old for me.

13:12.672 --> 13:15.140
No. No, he has a son.

13:16.008 --> 13:19.068
Oh, no, no, no. Forget about it.
No sons.

13:19.245 --> 13:20.405
He might be cute.

13:20.580 --> 13:22.571
Mom, you don't have
the greatest track record.

13:22.748 --> 13:24.443
The last time you set me up
on a blind date,

13:24.617 --> 13:26.141
the boy was barely
out of his diapers.

13:26.319 --> 13:28.344
Well, Lawrence Carson's son
is 24 years old.

13:28.521 --> 13:30.216
And he's probably very nice.

13:31.390 --> 13:34.382
- Well, that's the kiss of death.
- Brenda, hey, come on.

13:34.727 --> 13:36.194
Just one date.

13:36.963 --> 13:38.726
Okay, okay. What's his name?

13:39.298 --> 13:40.322
Stuart.

13:40.500 --> 13:41.592
Stuart?

13:42.168 --> 13:45.296
- What's wrong with that?
- Stuart's a perfectly fine name.

13:45.471 --> 13:49.874
Maybe, but somehow l don't think it
sounds like the name of my true love.

14:51.337 --> 14:52.964
Sorry.

14:53.539 --> 14:56.372
l just couldn't stop
thinking about you.

14:57.210 --> 14:58.370
Me too.

15:00.446 --> 15:01.674
You wanna come in?

15:03.182 --> 15:04.206
Yeah.

15:32.011 --> 15:34.571
- Morning, sunshine.
- What are you doing here?

15:34.747 --> 15:36.874
l thought they were having
a freshman pledge drive.

15:37.049 --> 15:39.040
Sorry, last time l checked,
l was a senior.

15:39.385 --> 15:40.716
You planned this, didn't you?

15:40.886 --> 15:42.615
Why? Would you be upset if l did?

15:45.424 --> 15:46.448
l don't know.

15:47.693 --> 15:49.786
Well, you said you were
gonna call me back last night,

15:49.962 --> 15:51.395
and you never did.

15:51.564 --> 15:55.398
Right. Sorry.
Just got a little overwhelmed.

15:55.568 --> 15:57.934
School and Alpha meeting,
everything.

15:58.104 --> 15:59.332
And Dylan.

15:59.505 --> 16:00.699
Dylan.

16:03.042 --> 16:04.339
Would you rather l didn't call?

16:05.344 --> 16:07.835
l just wish my life
was a little simpler.

16:08.014 --> 16:09.038
ls it complicated?

16:09.515 --> 16:10.914
Actually, yes, it is.

16:12.551 --> 16:16.920
l just need some time to figure out
how l want all of this to go.

16:17.657 --> 16:18.954
Okay.

16:19.125 --> 16:22.185
l'll give you 50 years to figure it out.
And not a minute more.

16:23.095 --> 16:24.562
l might need 51 .

16:25.031 --> 16:26.157
Okay.

16:27.867 --> 16:30.028
l hope your man
appreciates what he's got.

16:37.910 --> 16:39.707
So do l.

16:51.524 --> 16:54.550
- Who is it?
- lt's the tooth fairy.

17:01.734 --> 17:03.292
- Hi.
- Good morning.

17:03.836 --> 17:04.859
l'm not waking you, am l?

17:05.037 --> 17:09.736
No, no, l'm just having a hard time
getting started this morning.

17:09.909 --> 17:11.900
Well, coffee patrol to the rescue,

17:12.078 --> 17:13.875
and a little sugar rush
to go along with it.

17:14.046 --> 17:16.138
You didn't have to do that.

17:17.516 --> 17:19.176
Brandon, what are you
doing here anyway?

17:19.352 --> 17:20.444
Does a guy need a reason

17:20.618 --> 17:22.746
to come and see
one of his best friends for breakfast?

17:23.255 --> 17:24.449
No, of course not.

17:25.891 --> 17:28.553
So can l come in?

17:29.061 --> 17:32.053
Sure. l'm sorry. Come in.

17:35.301 --> 17:37.826
Well, as long as l'm here,
l might as well tap into your database

17:38.003 --> 17:40.563
for my Sociology class,
is that all right?

17:40.740 --> 17:42.640
l guess.

17:42.808 --> 17:44.241
All right.

17:44.877 --> 17:47.345
Next time, bring bagels, though.

17:52.818 --> 17:56.879
Brandon, do l look
any different today?

17:57.056 --> 17:58.523
What?

17:59.892 --> 18:01.519
Nothing. Never mind.

18:03.696 --> 18:04.856
Andrea, are you okay?

18:07.867 --> 18:12.463
Actually, l've never felt better.

18:23.015 --> 18:25.347
Rise and shine.

18:25.518 --> 18:26.712
Just ten more minutes.

18:26.886 --> 18:30.413
Nope. lf l give you ten, you'll take 30.
Look, it is a beautiful day outside.

18:30.589 --> 18:31.886
You're what's beautiful.

18:32.057 --> 18:35.322
Flattery will get you nowhere.

18:35.494 --> 18:36.961
Come here, just snuggle with me.

18:37.129 --> 18:40.826
You know, a kiss in the morning
will get me up and moving.

18:43.302 --> 18:45.793
Can l make
one teeny-weeny suggestion?

18:45.971 --> 18:48.201
- What?
- Brush your teeth.

18:50.242 --> 18:52.472
You really know how to kill
a romantic moment, don't you?

18:52.645 --> 18:55.113
Oh, look who's talking,
Mr. Sleep-All-Day.

18:55.281 --> 18:56.543
l don't sleep all day.

18:56.715 --> 18:58.774
Oh, that's right, l forgot.
You watch game shows too.

18:59.185 --> 19:01.653
Do you really have to start nagging
first thing in the morning?

19:01.821 --> 19:04.381
Nagging? That is not nagging.

19:05.624 --> 19:08.559
Clean up your room,
wash the dishes once in a while,

19:08.727 --> 19:10.092
go to a class or two.

19:10.262 --> 19:11.286
That's nagging.

19:11.464 --> 19:14.399
Well, excuse me, but l was at work
until 6 in the morning.

19:14.567 --> 19:17.536
Oh, please, David, you cannot let
your entire life go down the drain

19:17.703 --> 19:19.364
because you're a campus DJ.

19:19.538 --> 19:21.938
- l'm not.
- Yes, you are.

19:22.308 --> 19:23.366
Look, l gotta go.

19:23.542 --> 19:25.339
There's some coffee
in the kitchen, okay?

19:25.878 --> 19:27.345
Thank you.

19:27.513 --> 19:29.481
And you might
wanna do some laundry.

19:30.816 --> 19:32.807
lt was a suggestion.

19:43.095 --> 19:45.120
Motor Trend? Car and Driver?

19:45.297 --> 19:47.197
ls somebody buying
a new set of wheels here?

19:47.366 --> 19:49.266
Not me, my brother.

19:49.435 --> 19:51.164
What's the matter,
giving up on that Porsche?

19:51.337 --> 19:52.463
No, l'm not giving up on her.

19:52.638 --> 19:55.198
l just wanna ensure
she'll make it to old age, you know?

19:55.374 --> 19:57.672
Well, if you're looking for quality,
the choice is obvious.

19:57.843 --> 19:59.674
There's Corvette,
and then there's Corvette.

19:59.845 --> 20:01.745
l'll pass.

20:02.181 --> 20:03.307
What's he got against Vettes?

20:03.482 --> 20:05.575
l just don't think he's ready
to buy American yet.

20:05.751 --> 20:08.845
Mind you, if it was me with
the checkbook, l'd be thinking Viper.

20:09.021 --> 20:10.682
Viper? Over a Vette?

20:11.524 --> 20:13.185
Hi, guys.

20:13.359 --> 20:14.724
Hey, Kel. How'd it go this morning?

20:14.894 --> 20:16.623
Did you get stuck
with some geeky KEG pledge?

20:16.795 --> 20:19.059
Easy, guy. Those are my brothers
you're talking about.

20:19.231 --> 20:20.255
Runs in the family.

20:20.432 --> 20:23.595
- So, what's with the magazines?
- Dylan is in the market for a new car.

20:23.769 --> 20:25.259
Yeah? What's wrong
with the Porsche?

20:25.437 --> 20:27.564
lt's just in the shop again.

20:28.140 --> 20:31.473
Well, l think you should buy
a big old pink convertible Cadillac.

20:32.578 --> 20:34.443
Well, now, that's you.

20:34.613 --> 20:37.207
Yeah, l'll take it under advisement.

20:37.383 --> 20:39.248
As if.

20:41.887 --> 20:44.412
And he just sits on the sofa all day
with those game shows.

20:44.590 --> 20:46.820
l mean, who could've predicted
David would turn into mold

20:46.992 --> 20:48.721
when he started living on his own?

20:48.894 --> 20:51.886
- Well, what does Kelly say about it?
- She thinks he's disgusting.

20:52.064 --> 20:55.090
l mean, you should see his room.
lt's like some science experiment.

20:55.267 --> 20:57.167
How do people
survive relationships?

20:57.336 --> 20:58.633
Don't even start with me, Donna.

20:58.804 --> 21:00.169
At least you have a relationship.

21:00.339 --> 21:02.603
l, on the other hand,
have a blind date.

21:02.775 --> 21:04.402
- With who?
- l don't know.

21:04.577 --> 21:07.637
Some guy named Stuart.
l mean, doesn't that say it all?

21:08.581 --> 21:10.742
Whoever said college would be
the best years of our lives,

21:10.916 --> 21:12.747
vicious liars.

21:14.720 --> 21:17.188
Well, cowpokes,
we've done German,

21:17.356 --> 21:19.654
we've done ltalian,
we've done Sweden.

21:19.825 --> 21:21.258
Hell, we even went to Great Britain.

21:21.427 --> 21:24.919
But, boy, l'll tell you, it's good
to be back in the land of the free.

21:27.566 --> 21:29.898
Oh, Dylan, l like this one.

21:30.069 --> 21:31.229
Hold out for the Vette, bro.

21:31.403 --> 21:34.372
Are you kidding?
This is an automotive nirvana.

21:34.540 --> 21:36.804
l'm talking
unleaded orgasm here, boys.

21:36.976 --> 21:39.467
Brandon, l'm looking to buy a car,
not get religion, all right?

21:39.645 --> 21:41.078
Settle down.

21:41.880 --> 21:43.142
She's beautiful, isn't she?

21:43.315 --> 21:46.648
Dodge Viper represents the leading
edge of automotive technology

21:46.819 --> 21:48.309
and good old American know-how.

21:48.487 --> 21:50.887
You see, what did l tell you?
Didn't l--? Did l tell you?

21:51.056 --> 21:53.422
You know, we do have
a fabulous leasing program.

21:53.592 --> 21:57.824
Actually, that won't be necessary.
We're talking cash.

21:57.997 --> 21:59.862
- Cash?
- Cash.

22:00.032 --> 22:02.227
Well, maybe l can interest you
in a test drive.

22:02.401 --> 22:04.392
- Did you say test drive?
- Yeah.

22:04.570 --> 22:07.971
Ladies and gentlemen,
l think he just said the magic word.

22:14.446 --> 22:15.913
Did you get
the Faulkner reading done?

22:16.081 --> 22:18.845
lt took me all night.
Well, don't worry, nothing happens.

22:31.296 --> 22:33.059
l hope he doesn't call on me.

22:34.366 --> 22:36.197
Okay, let's get started.

22:36.368 --> 22:38.495
The Sound and the Fury,

22:41.173 --> 22:44.404
Brenda, l think your date is here.

22:46.645 --> 22:48.135
Hi, l'm Stuart.

22:48.313 --> 22:51.680
- Stuart, come right in.
- Thanks.

22:54.953 --> 22:57.581
- l'm Cindy, Brenda's mom.
- lt's very nice to meet you.

22:57.756 --> 23:00.452
Hi, Stuart. Jim Walsh.
Your father's told me a lot about you.

23:00.626 --> 23:02.093
Oh, that's dangerous.

23:02.261 --> 23:03.558
Stuart. Brandon Walsh.

23:03.729 --> 23:05.424
- Brenda's brother, twin brother.
- Really?

23:05.597 --> 23:07.258
So do you go
to California University also?

23:07.433 --> 23:10.027
Yeah, yeah, yeah, doing
the freshman thing like everyone else.

23:10.202 --> 23:11.362
What about you?

23:11.537 --> 23:14.062
l had a semester at Pepperdine.
Now l'm doing some other stuff,

23:14.239 --> 23:17.208
some consulting, investing.

23:17.376 --> 23:19.105
Actually, l just work with my dad.

23:19.812 --> 23:22.144
Sorry l'm a little late. l just...

23:25.617 --> 23:26.777
Hi.

23:27.319 --> 23:28.343
Hi.

23:30.255 --> 23:32.155
l guess my old man
was right for a change.

23:35.627 --> 23:36.787
Thanks. So was mine.

23:36.962 --> 23:39.795
See, Brenda, you just have to trust
your old man every once in a while.

23:39.965 --> 23:41.660
So going anywhere special?

23:41.834 --> 23:43.597
Yeah, l thought we'd swing
by Villa Cucina.

23:43.769 --> 23:44.963
Villa Cucina.

23:45.404 --> 23:47.634
l hear the cooking there
is almost as good as yours, Mom.

23:49.007 --> 23:50.599
l've been dying to go there myself.

23:50.776 --> 23:52.801
You really should.
The veal is the best in the city.

23:53.612 --> 23:55.443
Maybe Stuart can
get us a reservation.

23:56.482 --> 23:59.974
Well, have fun, kids, play safe.
Have a good time, really.

24:08.694 --> 24:11.288
- See you later, guys.
- Don't stay out too late.

24:12.397 --> 24:15.491
Sorry to pick you up so early. Traffic
at the beach this time of day is murder.

24:15.667 --> 24:17.225
No problem.

24:17.970 --> 24:21.497
- Nice car.
- Rich father.

24:23.942 --> 24:27.241
You know, Dad, this could be the start
of an exciting new career for you.

24:27.412 --> 24:29.880
Matchmaking by Walsh.

24:31.583 --> 24:35.314
- l'm just glad it worked out.
- Knock on wood.

24:40.993 --> 24:42.551
Who's that?

24:43.095 --> 24:45.222
l don't believe it.

24:47.833 --> 24:50.427
Dylan, nice car.

24:51.937 --> 24:53.837
Yeah, well,
l was on my way home with Kelly,

24:54.006 --> 24:56.941
we drove by a Porsche dealership,
and it was love at first sight.

24:57.109 --> 24:59.577
However, Jim, if the check bounces,
l'm a dead man.

24:59.745 --> 25:03.078
l see. Well, how much did it cost?

25:03.248 --> 25:07.241
Well, it was a little more than you
probably might have wanted to spend.

25:07.419 --> 25:09.046
l can see that.

25:09.221 --> 25:11.485
But the thing is,
it's a great car, you know?

25:11.657 --> 25:14.217
l figured, the old Porsche
is still running, these are great cars.

25:14.393 --> 25:17.123
l can afford a new one,
l got the money, so why not get it?

25:17.296 --> 25:19.594
l thought the idea
was to get a transportation vehicle.

25:20.799 --> 25:22.630
Okay, so it's not
a station wagon, all right?

25:22.801 --> 25:25.065
But l'm a little bolder than that.
Life is short.

25:25.237 --> 25:26.261
How much?

25:26.438 --> 25:28.167
See, that's the truly great thing
about this.

25:28.340 --> 25:31.468
lt is an expensive car, but l figure
l'll amortize it over, what, ten years.

25:31.643 --> 25:34.077
And the old one is a '61 ,
she's still running.

25:34.246 --> 25:35.270
How much?

25:36.148 --> 25:37.979
lt's on the sticker.

25:44.056 --> 25:46.422
Well, what do you have
to look forward to next?

25:46.592 --> 25:47.854
Rolls-Royce?

25:48.026 --> 25:50.017
Dylan, what's going on here?

25:50.195 --> 25:53.130
l never thought you needed
a car like this to show off with.

25:53.298 --> 25:54.993
So, what, you're not
gonna cover the check?

25:55.167 --> 25:56.327
l'm not saying that.

25:56.501 --> 25:57.968
Good, l'm glad
because it's my money.

25:58.136 --> 26:00.001
Let me learn how to deal with it.

26:33.705 --> 26:37.641
l really like this place, you know,
because it reminds me of Rome.

26:37.809 --> 26:39.936
And when in Rome,
do as the Romans do, right?

26:40.112 --> 26:42.171
Yeah, l guess.

26:42.848 --> 26:46.614
- So do you come here often?
- Yeah, pretty often.

26:51.790 --> 26:54.156
So my father tells me
that you started this semester

26:54.326 --> 26:55.816
at the University of Minnesota.

26:55.994 --> 26:58.462
Why did you decide to bag it?

26:59.698 --> 27:03.429
l don't know. lt just didn't really seem
the right place for me.

27:04.736 --> 27:05.896
l understand.

27:07.806 --> 27:10.707
Listen, l know you must be thinking

27:10.876 --> 27:14.471
what kind of a dork
needs his father to get him a date.

27:14.646 --> 27:18.275
No, no, no, not at all.
l'm having a wonderful time.

27:18.884 --> 27:21.375
Good. Me too.

27:23.488 --> 27:25.080
Can l get you anything from the bar

27:25.257 --> 27:27.248
before telling you
about our specials?

27:27.426 --> 27:31.920
Yes, how about a bottle of that
'79 brut we had the other night?

27:32.097 --> 27:33.496
- Of course.
- Great.

27:33.665 --> 27:36.862
lf l may trouble the young lady
for some identification.

27:37.035 --> 27:40.300
- Oh, l think l left my driver's license--
- Fernando will vouch for us.

27:40.472 --> 27:43.100
l'm sure that it will not be a problem.

27:43.275 --> 27:45.368
- Of course, sir. Right away.
- Thank you.

27:46.411 --> 27:48.345
Well, l guess
you have some influence here.

27:49.681 --> 27:51.308
My father's a partner.

27:53.585 --> 27:57.385
So champagne.
What are we celebrating?

27:57.556 --> 27:58.853
The ice between us breaking.

28:03.729 --> 28:05.560
Donna, we're gonna
have to be tough on him.

28:05.731 --> 28:07.961
l know. l just don't want him
to get mad at me.

28:08.133 --> 28:11.068
lt's for his own good
and our own sanity.

28:11.236 --> 28:12.999
David, we don't have all night.

28:13.171 --> 28:17.767
- What? What do you want?
- We told you, a house meeting.

28:17.943 --> 28:20.343
l hope this isn't a meeting
where the two of you get together

28:20.512 --> 28:22.776
and yell at me because l don't
wake up as early as you do.

28:22.948 --> 28:25.712
- lf so, l really have some things--
- Wait just a second, Mr. Silver.

28:25.884 --> 28:28.250
We have to set some house rules
right here and right now.

28:28.420 --> 28:30.911
Oh, really? Such as?

28:31.089 --> 28:33.751
Such as, if you make a mess
in the kitchen, you clean it up.

28:33.925 --> 28:36.655
And you wash your dishes
and you throw away your ravioli cans.

28:36.828 --> 28:38.853
Exactly. You would've never
left food out at home.

28:39.364 --> 28:42.424
Yes, l would have.
And Lucille would've cleaned it up.

28:42.601 --> 28:45.365
Excuse me, but we are not planning
on being your housekeepers.

28:45.537 --> 28:47.937
You need to clean up your act
and you need to study some more.

28:48.106 --> 28:50.131
And a little personal hygiene
would not hurt.

28:50.308 --> 28:52.276
Well, who died
and made you guys my parents?

28:52.444 --> 28:55.004
l mean, why should you be able
to tell me what l can and can't do?

28:55.180 --> 28:57.478
Because we live together
and majority rules.

28:57.649 --> 28:58.911
Majority nothing.

28:59.084 --> 29:01.143
l thought the whole idea
for getting this apartment

29:01.319 --> 29:03.048
was the freedom
to do what l wanted.

29:03.221 --> 29:07.021
David, we are just asking for a little
help keeping the apartment decent.

29:07.526 --> 29:08.720
Well, l have a job, okay?

29:08.894 --> 29:11.488
Stop using that stupid job
as an excuse.

29:12.064 --> 29:13.827
- Whatever, l gotta go.
- David--

29:13.999 --> 29:15.296
Look, just save it, all right?

29:15.467 --> 29:18.834
l had no idea l was gonna be moving in
with Mr. Clean and the Ty-D-Bol Man.

29:23.275 --> 29:24.799
Dan...

29:26.445 --> 29:29.209
Are you sure that it
was such a good idea, our--?

29:29.381 --> 29:31.713
Our getting involved?

29:32.818 --> 29:35.116
Andrea, where's this coming from?

29:36.154 --> 29:39.681
l don't know, l've just been thinking.
And it...

29:39.858 --> 29:42.383
...just seems so wrong.

29:42.561 --> 29:43.892
l had a wonderful time last night.

29:44.863 --> 29:47.491
- So did l.
- Then what's the matter?

29:48.300 --> 29:52.566
l just can't have you
as my teacher in English class

29:52.737 --> 29:54.762
and my lover in the dorm.

29:54.940 --> 29:57.067
lt's too hard.

29:58.577 --> 30:00.807
We've gotta make a choice.

30:00.979 --> 30:03.709
l either switch English classes,

30:05.283 --> 30:07.444
or we stop seeing each other.

30:08.453 --> 30:12.480
Well, it doesn't seem
like much of a choice.

30:13.391 --> 30:14.483
lt doesn't?

30:15.093 --> 30:16.822
Find yourself
another English teacher.

30:26.771 --> 30:28.363
This dessert
is even better than you said.

30:28.540 --> 30:31.065
l've never had
chocolate creme bruIee before.

30:31.243 --> 30:33.734
- So you like it?
- Like it?

30:33.912 --> 30:37.006
This is unequivocally
the best meal l have ever had.

30:37.182 --> 30:40.242
- That seems hard to believe.
- Well, believe it.

30:40.418 --> 30:41.783
But you don't know my ex-boyfriend.

30:41.953 --> 30:44.114
We never went to places like this.

30:44.289 --> 30:46.780
Actually, we hardly ever went out.

30:46.958 --> 30:48.550
And we never ever
had wine with dinner.

30:48.894 --> 30:50.555
Never?

30:50.729 --> 30:52.822
Well, Dylan...

30:52.998 --> 30:54.898
Dylan's an alcoholic,
you know, recovering.

30:55.066 --> 30:56.226
A twelve-stepper?

30:56.401 --> 30:59.097
Yeah, which is great
that he's dealing with it

30:59.271 --> 31:00.533
and l really respect him for it.

31:00.705 --> 31:03.674
But sometimes
it wasn't exactly fun for me.

31:03.842 --> 31:06.140
Well, maybe it's time
you started having some fun.

31:06.511 --> 31:08.138
Oh, well, don't get the wrong idea.

31:08.313 --> 31:10.611
l mean, we had fun,
just not like this.

31:10.782 --> 31:13.546
Dylan was different.
He's kind of a hard guy to explain.

31:13.985 --> 31:15.475
Well, let's not even try.

31:18.156 --> 31:20.556
l'm sorry.
Consider the subject closed.

31:20.725 --> 31:23.717
Good, because the night is young
and you ain't seen nothing yet.

31:44.216 --> 31:47.549
Hey, hello there, Stuart.
We've missed you.

31:47.719 --> 31:52.622
Brenda, this is Margeaux and Deeana,
two of my favorite troublemakers.

31:56.228 --> 31:58.458
- Hey.
- What's happening?

31:58.630 --> 32:00.757
ls there anyone here
you don't know?

32:00.932 --> 32:03.025
The owner and l
went to prep school together.

32:03.201 --> 32:05.897
Guess l've gotten kind of chummy
with most of the regulars.

32:06.071 --> 32:07.834
Hey, how's it going?

32:09.040 --> 32:10.234
- Here.
- Do you dance?

32:10.408 --> 32:12.569
- Yeah, let's go.
- Great.

32:44.209 --> 32:47.337
- Are we having fun yet?
- Oh, not at all.

32:56.755 --> 32:57.779
Hello?

32:57.956 --> 32:58.980
Guess who.

32:59.557 --> 33:01.422
This is getting to be a habit, isn't it?

33:01.593 --> 33:04.118
- What is?
- You calling me.

33:04.296 --> 33:06.560
l thought we agreed
it was okay to call you.

33:06.731 --> 33:07.857
We did,

33:08.033 --> 33:10.297
Oh, look but don't touch, right?

33:10.902 --> 33:11.926
That's right.

33:12.437 --> 33:15.770
So tell me, what's going on
at the freshman pad tonight?

33:15.940 --> 33:18.932
Nothing. Donna's asleep,
David's at the radio station.

33:19.110 --> 33:22.568
And you? What's the world's most
desirable coed doing this evening?

33:22.747 --> 33:24.374
l'm just in bed studying.

33:24.783 --> 33:27.343
ln bed? Really?

33:27.519 --> 33:30.317
And what's the world's most desirable
coed wearing this evening?

33:31.323 --> 33:33.814
Call a 900 number, John.

33:33.992 --> 33:36.392
- Don't you have anything better to do?
- Not reaIIy,

33:36.761 --> 33:39.662
Unless l can convince you
to come out with me tonight.

33:40.298 --> 33:41.458
l can't do that.

33:42.500 --> 33:44.058
Well...

33:45.236 --> 33:46.897
Then talk on the phone it is.

33:47.072 --> 33:49.472
Okay, let's talk.

33:49.641 --> 33:51.666
So are you coming
to our mud bowl tomorrow night?

33:51.843 --> 33:52.867
Maybe,

33:54.346 --> 33:57.110
Hold on, somebody's at the door.

34:00.485 --> 34:02.544
Hey. What are you doing here?

34:02.721 --> 34:06.282
l don't know. l've just been
driving around for a couple of hours.

34:07.892 --> 34:09.359
What's the matter?
Buyer's remorse?

34:09.728 --> 34:12.094
- Do you think l'm showing off?
- No, l love that car.

34:12.263 --> 34:14.594
l do too, it's a great car, you know.
l mean, it is my life.

34:14.766 --> 34:18.429
lf l wanna go out and buy
a brand-new car, what's the big deal?

34:18.603 --> 34:20.264
Where is all this coming from?

34:21.840 --> 34:22.966
Jim Walsh.

34:23.808 --> 34:26.402
Would you please stop letting him
bother you? lt is your money.

34:26.811 --> 34:29.210
- That's what l said.
- Then what is the problem?

34:29.380 --> 34:31.406
l don't know.

34:32.650 --> 34:35.847
l know it's late,
but you wanna take a drive with me?

34:36.688 --> 34:41.351
Yeah, sure.
Let me just go put some clothes on.

34:43.695 --> 34:45.094
Okay.

34:47.331 --> 34:48.594
Sorry. Are you still there?

34:48.766 --> 34:51.565
l told you l'd wait 50 years.
lt's only been a couple of minutes.

34:51.735 --> 34:54.603
- Listen, John, l gotta go.
- Why?

34:54.773 --> 34:55.797
l'll call you tomorrow.

34:56.975 --> 35:00.911
- Where have l heard that before?
- Tomorrow, l promise.

35:04.382 --> 35:06.543
Any time, Kel.

35:25.503 --> 35:27.528
Oh, l must look like
l've been in a steam room.

35:27.705 --> 35:29.332
l like that look.

35:29.507 --> 35:31.031
Come on. Come on.

35:31.209 --> 35:33.769
- Wait, what time is it?
- lt's a little after 1 .

35:33.945 --> 35:36.277
- Oh, God, l've gotta get home.
- Come on, it's early.

35:36.448 --> 35:39.246
Yeah, but l have class in the morning,
and l hate worrying my parents.

35:40.118 --> 35:41.142
l'll tell you what.

35:41.319 --> 35:44.652
We haven't danced
a slow dance, right? Just one.

35:44.823 --> 35:46.814
Okay, just one.

35:46.991 --> 35:50.552
You say that now, but slow dances
with me are like potato chips.

35:50.728 --> 35:52.662
- You can't have just one.
- We'll see about that.

35:52.831 --> 35:54.128
Okay.

36:04.175 --> 36:08.908
- Wanna join me in a bowl of cereal?
- Why, Dad, l don't think we'd both fit.

36:14.185 --> 36:15.652
What are you doing up so late?

36:15.820 --> 36:18.914
Trying to plow through all my notes
for this Sociology exam.

36:19.090 --> 36:21.081
l'm deep in theories
of deviant behavior right now.

36:21.259 --> 36:22.283
You'll do fine.

36:22.460 --> 36:23.654
And what about you, young man?

36:23.828 --> 36:26.262
One forty-five is a little past
your bedtime, isn't it?

36:27.065 --> 36:29.556
Worried that your blind date
went a little too well, huh?

36:29.734 --> 36:31.361
Hey, l'm hungry. Do you mind?

36:31.936 --> 36:34.336
You and l both know you're
waiting up for Brenda to get home.

36:34.506 --> 36:37.407
Can't a guy have a bowl of corn flakes
without having an ulterior motive?

36:37.575 --> 36:39.167
Whatever you say.

36:39.344 --> 36:40.777
But listen, when you see her,

36:40.945 --> 36:42.936
give her a little hell
for me too, will you?

36:56.561 --> 36:59.428
And now for something
completely different.

36:59.597 --> 37:01.656
A personal thought.

37:03.434 --> 37:08.963
For those of you who are listening,
the few, the proud, the insomniacs,

37:09.741 --> 37:12.141
l have a confession to make.

37:13.912 --> 37:15.209
Since l've been living on my own,

37:15.380 --> 37:20.647
l've turned into quite a slob,
a class-A pig.

37:21.653 --> 37:26.750
And honestly, l've been driving
my girlfriend and my roommate crazy.

37:27.292 --> 37:29.351
Donna, if you're Iistening,

37:30.128 --> 37:32.528
I'm gonna try and mend my ways,

37:33.197 --> 37:35.222
You've made me see the Iight,

37:47.712 --> 37:49.703
Girlfriend giving you grief?

37:50.548 --> 37:52.812
lt's just this schedule.

37:52.984 --> 37:56.784
l'm so spent all the time,
l can barely talk, let alone clean up.

37:56.955 --> 37:59.355
Yeah, night shift
does take some getting used to.

37:59.757 --> 38:02.783
How'd you do it,
up all night, every night?

38:03.761 --> 38:07.322
Well, with the help
of my little friend, Mr. Stay-Awake.

38:07.498 --> 38:09.557
Here, take these.
These will keep you up and at them.

38:10.468 --> 38:12.936
- No, thanks. l don't do that.
- lt's just caffeine.

38:13.104 --> 38:14.366
But don't take too many of them,

38:14.539 --> 38:16.905
because they can get you
kind of lightheaded.

38:21.512 --> 38:22.706
- Thanks.
- My pleasure.

38:22.880 --> 38:26.577
Listen, l know
that the graveyard shift is a killer.

38:26.751 --> 38:30.016
So if you ever need anything stronger,
don't be shy.

38:31.556 --> 38:32.580
All right.

38:33.424 --> 38:35.016
My pleasure.

39:01.653 --> 39:03.712
So you feel better now?

39:04.322 --> 39:06.483
Yeah, thanks.

39:10.294 --> 39:12.819
l love the smell of real leather.

39:12.997 --> 39:14.191
Yeah, well, get a good whiff

39:14.365 --> 39:17.630
because tomorrow l'm trading it
for a Ford Bronco.

39:18.803 --> 39:20.293
Really?

39:20.672 --> 39:23.038
Jim was right. l don't need this car.

39:23.207 --> 39:26.199
This car's for picking up girls,
l already got a girl.

39:27.111 --> 39:28.544
Yeah.

39:30.314 --> 39:33.875
Are you okay, Kel?
Been kind of quiet.

39:34.052 --> 39:37.180
Yeah, l'm just tired.
l was up really early, you know?

39:37.655 --> 39:41.250
Well, you know, the best place to get
a good night of sleep is my house.

39:41.426 --> 39:42.654
l don't think so.

39:42.827 --> 39:45.489
Okay, maybe not so much
for the sleep,

39:45.663 --> 39:48.632
but the night will be good.

39:55.039 --> 39:57.007
Kel, what is it?

39:59.343 --> 40:01.208
l don't know.

40:02.680 --> 40:04.477
l guess...

40:04.649 --> 40:05.741
You guess what?

40:05.917 --> 40:10.980
l guess it seems like we both
just want different things right now.

40:12.457 --> 40:14.618
l know you think it's silly,

40:14.792 --> 40:18.660
but l wanna go to fraternity parties
and l wanna go to football games.

40:18.830 --> 40:20.491
l wanna do all that stuff.

40:21.032 --> 40:22.260
Yeah?

40:23.735 --> 40:27.034
l just think that maybe
we should start seeing other people.

40:30.174 --> 40:31.232
l see.

40:31.743 --> 40:34.177
lt's no one in particular.

40:34.979 --> 40:37.743
l just wanna know
that l can if l want to.

40:40.284 --> 40:42.514
lt's not like l wanna break up with you
or anything.

40:45.656 --> 40:46.850
l'm sorry.

40:47.024 --> 40:49.219
Yeah, l'm sorry too.

40:49.660 --> 40:52.185
l mean, this can be dangerous,
this seeing other people.

40:53.464 --> 40:54.795
That's how we started.

40:55.233 --> 40:58.134
Brenda said
the exact same thing you just did.

40:58.569 --> 41:00.161
l know.

41:03.241 --> 41:05.505
Yeah, well, you have a good night.

41:06.811 --> 41:08.506
Will you call me?

41:11.115 --> 41:12.878
Sometime.

41:56.027 --> 41:58.518
Thanks, Stuart. l had a great time.

41:59.197 --> 42:00.755
Me too.

42:01.332 --> 42:04.460
l would invite you in,
but my father's probably waiting up,

42:04.635 --> 42:06.227
preparing a lecture for me.

42:06.704 --> 42:09.172
Well, let him wait
just one more minute.

42:18.916 --> 42:20.406
l better go in.

42:20.885 --> 42:21.909
Okay.

42:23.287 --> 42:25.016
l'll let you go.

42:26.090 --> 42:29.753
Just tell me, do you have any plans
for the rest of the week?

42:29.927 --> 42:31.952
Not really.

42:32.563 --> 42:34.121
How about for the rest of your life?

42:37.501 --> 42:39.560
l'll talk to you later.

42:39.737 --> 42:41.261
Good night.

42:55.887 --> 42:57.252
Hi, Dad.

42:57.421 --> 43:00.015
Look, l'm sorry if you were worried.

43:00.191 --> 43:04.628
l know l should've called
and l know it's late, very late.

43:05.129 --> 43:06.994
But actually, l've been thinking.

43:07.565 --> 43:08.589
Yes?

43:09.000 --> 43:11.491
l think it's time
for a new understanding between us.

43:12.904 --> 43:15.896
Look, l know l'm still living at home,
but l'm not a little girl anymore.

43:16.274 --> 43:17.935
l'm an adult in college,

43:18.109 --> 43:21.272
and l think that l can be trusted
to make my own decisions, okay?

43:22.079 --> 43:23.103
Okay.

43:23.681 --> 43:25.308
- Come again?
- l have to agree.

43:25.683 --> 43:26.741
You're an adult.

43:26.918 --> 43:31.378
Part of me wishes you weren't,
but l can't turn back the clock.

43:31.989 --> 43:33.854
Even if it is after 2.

43:35.426 --> 43:37.587
So you have a good time tonight?

43:40.298 --> 43:42.357
Stuart seemed very nice.

43:42.533 --> 43:44.433
He is.

43:44.602 --> 43:48.265
Well, l'm turning in.

43:48.439 --> 43:51.931
- You going upstairs?
- Not quite yet.

43:52.109 --> 43:53.838
Okay. See you in the morning.

43:54.011 --> 43:56.241
Okay. l love you.

44:03.888 --> 44:07.415
l can't believe
you let her get away with it.

44:07.591 --> 44:09.491
Good night, Brandon.

44:30.214 --> 44:32.580
Get out of the car, sucker.
