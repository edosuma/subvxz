00:04.091 --> 00:06.136
- She's dead.

00:06.180 --> 00:07.877
You killed Alexa.

00:07.920 --> 00:09.705
Barry and I did it together.

00:09.748 --> 00:11.011
That was the only way.

00:11.054 --> 00:13.230
She was the strongest.

00:13.274 --> 00:15.015
I needed every ounce of power,

00:15.058 --> 00:16.538
including your strength,
to kill her.

00:16.581 --> 00:19.410
- I'm supposed to protect
lives, not destroy them!

00:19.454 --> 00:21.282
- I'm helping you clean up
your mess, Barry.

00:21.325 --> 00:23.023
This is your fault.

00:23.066 --> 00:26.374
The night you brought me back,
you created these monsters.

00:27.244 --> 00:29.072
You and your lightning rod.

00:31.814 --> 00:33.381
When you regained your speed,

00:33.424 --> 00:36.340
I wasn't the only thing
you two willed into existence.

00:36.384 --> 00:39.300
- That's impossible.
- Really?

00:40.388 --> 00:44.044
Alexa was afraid to come here,
but she trusted you.

00:45.654 --> 00:46.872
Why?

00:48.439 --> 00:51.312
Because deep down, she could
feel a connection with you.

00:51.355 --> 00:54.054
The same connection
that you feel with me now.

00:54.097 --> 00:56.012
But, these new forces?

00:56.056 --> 00:58.667
The way they've merged with the
people they chose as avatars?

00:58.710 --> 01:01.800
It's corrupted them
because it's unnatural.

01:03.193 --> 01:05.065
But once the other two
are gone--

01:05.108 --> 01:07.023
- I won't help you kill again.

01:07.067 --> 01:08.677
- Oh...

01:10.157 --> 01:12.376
My beautiful boy.

01:13.856 --> 01:16.337
You have no choice.

01:16.380 --> 01:17.903
Because if you don't,

01:17.947 --> 01:22.125
those things will kill everyone
you've sworn to keep safe.

01:22.169 --> 01:24.084
Is that what you want?

01:26.303 --> 01:29.785
Then, please, Barry...

01:29.828 --> 01:31.308
help me.

01:35.182 --> 01:36.574
- No.

01:36.618 --> 01:39.055
- You have to help me,
damn it!

01:39.099 --> 01:41.188
- Nora, stop.

01:44.626 --> 01:47.237
- I will destroy
those other forces, Barry,

01:47.281 --> 01:50.458
with or without your help.

01:50.501 --> 01:52.764
Then you'll see that I'm right.

02:21.837 --> 02:24.492
First, Frost is sent to
Iron Heights for life,

02:24.535 --> 02:26.929
and now Alexa's dead.

02:26.972 --> 02:28.931
- I can't let this happen
again.

02:28.974 --> 02:30.846
- I'll get to work.
I need to figure out

02:30.889 --> 02:33.109
how Nora was able to...

02:33.153 --> 02:34.589
- Kill a god?

02:34.632 --> 02:36.156
- She could
because she had help.

02:36.199 --> 02:37.983
- Barry, she tricked you.

02:38.027 --> 02:39.246
- No, she manipulated me,

02:39.289 --> 02:40.725
just like she's been doing
the whole time.

02:40.769 --> 02:43.902
- Honey, I know how you feel,but...

02:43.946 --> 02:45.817
not everything she did
and said was a lie.

02:45.861 --> 02:47.645
I mean, there were moments
that felt real too.

02:47.689 --> 02:48.646
That must mean--

02:48.690 --> 02:51.171
- Iris, we can't trust her
anymore.

02:54.130 --> 02:55.827
- What about
what Nora said

02:55.871 --> 02:58.743
about you two
creating the other forces?

02:59.266 --> 03:00.919
- I mean,
there's no proof.

03:00.963 --> 03:04.401
- Well, what if we find out
if Nora's telling the truth?

03:04.445 --> 03:06.490
If she is, then that means
the other forces

03:06.534 --> 03:08.405
would have been born
the same day she was.

03:08.449 --> 03:09.754
- I'll pull satellite scans

03:09.798 --> 03:11.147
from the night we fought
Mirror Monarch.

03:11.191 --> 03:13.628
- Please, and thank you.

03:16.718 --> 03:19.721
- Okay, you see that cluster of
kinetic energy readings?

03:19.764 --> 03:22.202
Pretty sure
that's the Speed Force

03:22.245 --> 03:24.508
being reborn in the Speed Lab.

03:24.552 --> 03:27.250
Whoa. There they are.

03:27.294 --> 03:30.601
Three brand-spanking-new
isotopic signatures.

03:32.386 --> 03:35.127
- Nora was right.

03:35.171 --> 03:38.696
- We created the forces.

03:41.830 --> 03:43.266
<i>- Fuerza's dead.</i>

03:43.310 --> 03:45.050
Nora killed her.

03:45.094 --> 03:47.139
- She killed
the Strength Force?

03:47.183 --> 03:50.665
- And now she wants to kill
the other two forces.

03:50.708 --> 03:54.059
- Maybe I should go to
San Francisco.

03:54.103 --> 03:55.757
- What?

03:55.800 --> 03:58.107
- My series of photos
on Eva's attacks

03:58.150 --> 03:59.848
got accepted
at a gallery there.

03:59.891 --> 04:01.153
- Babe, congrats!

04:01.197 --> 04:03.199
Well,
I was thinking of going

04:03.243 --> 04:04.983
to help them install
the exhibition.

04:05.027 --> 04:08.552
I'd ask you to come, but I know
you have your perfect job

04:08.596 --> 04:10.902
at S.T.A.R. Labs
and your amazing friends.

04:10.946 --> 04:13.731
I mean...you're an OG member
of Team Flash.

04:16.952 --> 04:19.041
You okay?

04:19.084 --> 04:20.260
- Yeah...

04:20.303 --> 04:22.610
Yeah, I'm fine.

04:22.653 --> 04:25.917
This is an isotopic
scanning lens.

04:25.961 --> 04:28.659
It can detect the signatures
of all four forces,

04:28.703 --> 04:31.532
even kinetic signatures
from Speed Force Nora.

04:31.575 --> 04:33.055
And if one's nearby--

04:33.098 --> 04:35.710
- It lights up like
an overexposed landscape.

04:35.753 --> 04:38.452
- In which case,
you run the other way.

04:38.495 --> 04:41.498
-
- Okay? I'm serious.

04:42.325 --> 04:44.675
I just want you to be safe.

04:46.503 --> 04:48.636
- Are you sure you're okay?

04:52.640 --> 04:54.032
- Ohh, it's Barry.

04:54.076 --> 04:56.470
I gotta get back--they could
have found Nora...

04:56.513 --> 04:58.646
or worse, she's come back
on her own.

05:02.127 --> 05:03.303
- How bad is it?

05:03.346 --> 05:05.087
- Okay--did Nora
kill somebody else?

05:05.130 --> 05:07.307
- No, and I have a way to make
sure she never does.

05:07.350 --> 05:09.221
- Okay, how?

05:09.265 --> 05:10.788
- I'm here.

05:10.832 --> 05:12.573
What's going on?

05:12.616 --> 05:14.531
- I spent all night

05:14.575 --> 05:16.446
coming up with a way
to fix all this.

05:16.490 --> 05:19.014
- Okay, what's the solve?

05:19.057 --> 05:22.322
- We need to wipe the new
forces out of existence.

05:22.365 --> 05:23.801
- Barry, what are you saying?

05:23.845 --> 05:27.414
- I want to go back in time...
and uncreate them.

05:37.511 --> 05:39.164
- Barry, you're talking about
creating another Flashpoint.

05:39.208 --> 05:40.601
You know we can't do that.

05:40.644 --> 05:42.254
- Not if I can figure out
a way to go back

05:42.298 --> 05:43.908
that doesn't affect
the timeline.

05:43.952 --> 05:45.823
- Which would be impossible.
- Barry, look.

05:45.867 --> 05:48.522
I know that you're devastated
about Alexa.

05:48.565 --> 05:51.438
But uncreating forces?

05:51.481 --> 05:52.874
That crosses a line.

05:52.917 --> 05:55.137
- I convinced Alexa
to come here.

05:55.180 --> 05:57.095
Her death is my fault.

05:57.139 --> 05:59.576
If we don't get these new
forces out of Psych and Deon,

05:59.620 --> 06:02.274
Nora will kill them, too,
so it's on us to fix this.

06:02.318 --> 06:04.799
- By killing Deon and Psych?
- No, I'm not killing them.

06:04.842 --> 06:07.367
I'm saving them from the forces
that took over their lives.

06:07.410 --> 06:08.759
Whoever they were before this,
they can

06:08.803 --> 06:10.457
go back to being those
same people again.

06:10.500 --> 06:13.155
- And what about the other
force that was born that night?

06:13.198 --> 06:15.549
Nora. If you uncreate her--
- We're only gonna target

06:15.592 --> 06:17.855
the new forces, not Nora.
That's the plan.

06:17.899 --> 06:19.640
- But if something
goes wrong,

06:19.683 --> 06:21.642
Barry, you might
lose your speed.

06:21.685 --> 06:23.905
- Then I lose my speed.
All right?

06:23.948 --> 06:26.647
It's--it's worth the risk
to keep everyone safe.

06:26.690 --> 06:28.605
- And what about the risk
to Nora?

06:28.649 --> 06:30.520
Does her life not matter
at all any--

06:30.564 --> 06:34.132
- Nora's not a person, Iris.

06:34.176 --> 06:36.700
She never was.

06:36.744 --> 06:39.790
Look, if we uncreate
these forces,

06:39.834 --> 06:42.489
we can put everything
back to normal.

06:42.532 --> 06:44.360
Hopefully that'll fix her too.

06:44.404 --> 06:46.710
- Hopefully?

06:46.754 --> 06:48.886
Barry, do you hear yourself
right now?

06:48.930 --> 06:52.237
- Iris, I'm trying
to save people.

06:52.281 --> 06:55.719
How--how do you not see
this is the right thing to do?

06:55.763 --> 06:57.547
- The right thing to do

06:57.591 --> 06:59.723
would be trying to
get through to Nora.

06:59.767 --> 07:01.203
Just like how we beat Eva,

07:01.246 --> 07:02.900
just like how we talked down
Abra Kadabra.

07:02.944 --> 07:05.903
That is what we do.
- We tried talking to her.

07:05.947 --> 07:08.036
All Nora did was double down.

07:08.079 --> 07:10.778
-
- There's no reaching her.

07:10.821 --> 07:12.910
Obviously we disagree on this.

07:12.954 --> 07:15.957
- Yes, we do.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.437
- I have to do it.

07:21.745 --> 07:25.923
- Then you'll be doing it
without me.

07:32.321 --> 07:35.759
- Wait...you want to go
after a force of nature?

07:35.803 --> 07:38.632
- Yeah, if I can convince Nora
not to kill Deon and Psych,

07:38.675 --> 07:41.765
then... Barry will see that
she can be reasoned with.

07:41.809 --> 07:43.158
- But, how do we find her?

07:43.201 --> 07:45.247
I mean, she's the freakin'
Speed Force.

07:45.290 --> 07:46.509
- Well, if she finds us first,

07:46.553 --> 07:49.947
at least we'll know
she's coming.

07:49.991 --> 07:52.820
Holy crap...you guys gotta
see this.

07:55.039 --> 07:57.302
You see that bright spot
at the center of you?

07:57.346 --> 08:00.001
I think that's kinetic energy.

08:00.044 --> 08:02.177
- Guys, this is gonna sound
really wild, but...

08:02.220 --> 08:05.267
- Yeah, 'cause a ghost-hunting
lens isn't weird enough...

08:05.310 --> 08:07.835
- But, if Barry and I created
these forces,

08:07.878 --> 08:10.620
what if there's a little bit of
each of them inside of us?

08:10.664 --> 08:13.710
- Like you're all connected?

08:13.754 --> 08:15.712
- Wait, Iris...
when you're over by the door,

08:15.756 --> 08:17.192
your glow was brighter.

08:17.235 --> 08:18.802
Like there's something
in that direction

08:18.846 --> 08:20.587
that was intensifying it.

08:20.630 --> 08:23.241
What if...
- That something is Nora?

08:23.981 --> 08:28.464
Guys, we can use me as a
divining rod to track her down.

08:28.508 --> 08:31.728
- Yup, that's weirder.

08:33.730 --> 08:35.515
- Elemental Force Particles?

08:35.558 --> 08:37.778
- They're the particles
that created the new forces.

08:37.821 --> 08:39.693
The lightning bolt
that rebirthed the Speed Force

08:39.736 --> 08:41.738
was full of them.
- Now if we can extract

08:41.782 --> 08:43.348
a sample
of these force particles

08:43.392 --> 08:44.654
from the lightning,

08:44.698 --> 08:46.743
then we can send out
an electromagnetic pulse

08:46.787 --> 08:48.658
that'll seek out those
same particles,

08:48.702 --> 08:50.312
wherever they may be
along the temporal spectrum.

08:50.355 --> 08:54.098
- And you can erase the new
forces from existence.

08:54.142 --> 08:56.057
That's not bad.

08:56.100 --> 08:57.624
Small detail, though.

08:57.667 --> 08:59.843
How in the world
are you supposed to

08:59.887 --> 09:03.934
extract these particles
from a giant bolt of lightning?

09:03.978 --> 09:06.720
- A few weeks ago when
Barry was Spock-Flash,

09:06.763 --> 09:09.113
he modified the Tachyon
Enhancer to siphon

09:09.157 --> 09:11.115
Mirror Monarch's
dark matter photons.

09:11.159 --> 09:13.204
- So all we have to do
is tweak the Enhancer

09:13.248 --> 09:16.164
to siphon Force Particles
instead of photons.

09:17.600 --> 09:19.254
- Tweaking the
Tachyon Enhancer...

09:19.297 --> 09:22.431
and then send out an EMP
to eighty-six the forces.

09:22.474 --> 09:25.565
That's genius. I mean
it's foolproof, even.

09:27.610 --> 09:31.571
But it still doesn't answer how
we're supposed to do this

09:31.614 --> 09:34.617
and protect the timeline.

09:34.661 --> 09:37.141
- I'll figure out.
Somehow, I will.

09:37.185 --> 09:38.708
I'll figure it out.

09:38.752 --> 09:41.711
- Man, I wish Nash Wells
was here.

09:41.755 --> 09:43.757

most of these equations

09:43.800 --> 09:45.106
for the A.S.F. Machine.

09:45.149 --> 09:48.457
I feel like
he'd crack this easy peasy.

09:49.371 --> 09:51.025
- Modify the Particle Harness
Collector.

09:51.068 --> 09:52.722
I'll be back as soon as I can.

09:52.766 --> 09:55.986

affecting the timeline?

11:10.887 --> 11:12.497
- I know we can.

11:12.541 --> 11:14.543
As long as we use me
as your guide.

11:14.586 --> 11:16.327
- Harrison was there when
the forces were created.

11:16.371 --> 11:18.329
So if we used the other "him"
from that night

11:18.373 --> 11:19.766
as a beacon to lock onto--

11:19.809 --> 11:22.856
- Hopefully I can go back
to that exact moment,

11:22.899 --> 11:24.727
also bring Allen along
for the ride,

11:24.771 --> 11:26.686
and he'll collect
the particles.

11:26.729 --> 11:30.167
- Oof, wait, so you can travel
through time with a plus one?

11:30.211 --> 11:32.169
- It should work...

11:32.213 --> 11:34.650
When Allen and I go back
to that exact moment

11:34.694 --> 11:37.609
that those dangerous forces
were created 17 days ago,

11:37.653 --> 11:41.570
I will--I will create
a protective-time bubble

11:41.613 --> 11:44.312
from that moment until now,

11:44.355 --> 11:46.706
preserving those days
in this timeline,

11:46.749 --> 11:51.362
and preventing
anything from changing.

11:51.406 --> 11:55.758
- Which would also allow us
to wipe out the new forces

11:55.802 --> 11:58.630
without altering
any of the events

11:58.674 --> 11:59.849
that have happened
since then--

11:59.893 --> 12:03.200
Yo! That is--that is trippy.

12:03.244 --> 12:04.941
- Cisco, this will work.

12:04.985 --> 12:06.551
- What about Iris?

12:06.595 --> 12:09.293
- When she sees everyone safe,
she'll come around.

12:09.337 --> 12:10.642
She has to.

12:10.686 --> 12:13.689
- You're not convinced.
I wasn't either,

12:13.733 --> 12:16.431
when Allen told me about this,
I thought of Tess.

12:17.693 --> 12:21.175
I thought of my wife, and how
my future with Tess was...

12:21.218 --> 12:23.133
ripped from me.

12:23.177 --> 12:24.831
Until this gift...

12:24.874 --> 12:30.227
which has allowed me to relive
every single day with Tess,

12:30.271 --> 12:33.056
but only...

12:33.100 --> 12:34.449
because I took a chance.

12:37.452 --> 12:44.372
<i>♪</i>

12:44.415 --> 12:46.156
- All right.

12:46.200 --> 12:48.289
I'm in.

12:53.642 --> 12:55.905
- It's brighter.
We must be getting close.

12:59.648 --> 13:01.781
She should be here.

13:01.824 --> 13:04.653
- Maybe it was
a false positive.

13:06.089 --> 13:07.917
- Maybe since Nora
is the Speed Force,

13:07.961 --> 13:10.485
her isotopic signature
is all over the city by now.

13:10.528 --> 13:12.530
- So what do we do?
- I don't know.

13:12.574 --> 13:14.619
But we are running
out of time.

13:14.663 --> 13:16.665
- Well, Cisco always says
you can't solve a problem

13:16.708 --> 13:18.232
till you're asking
the right question.

13:18.275 --> 13:20.974
- Isn't "Where's Nora's
kinetic energy leading us"

13:21.017 --> 13:23.411
the right question?

13:23.454 --> 13:24.847
- No.

13:24.891 --> 13:27.632
The right question is
"Where's Nora?"

13:27.676 --> 13:29.504
We've been trying to find
the Speed Force

13:29.547 --> 13:32.594
when we should be looking
for... the person.

13:32.637 --> 13:36.424
- So where would the real
Nora Allen go?

13:36.467 --> 13:38.382
- Home.

13:38.426 --> 13:39.906
Come on.

13:43.779 --> 13:46.521
- Harness modifications
complete.

13:46.564 --> 13:49.002
Let's get some time particles.

13:50.612 --> 13:52.570
Actually, you know what?
Um...

13:52.614 --> 13:55.008
Let me run just one more
diagnostic

13:55.051 --> 13:56.879
on the collection disc.

13:56.923 --> 14:00.752
I just need
one more, just one more...

14:07.542 --> 14:11.024
- Oh, frak.

14:11.067 --> 14:13.330
Yo, yo, Deon.

14:13.374 --> 14:14.766
What's--what's uh...

14:14.810 --> 14:17.857
What's good, man?
- You tell me.

14:19.206 --> 14:21.730
Something drew me here.

14:22.470 --> 14:24.167
Was it you?

14:24.211 --> 14:25.647
- I'm--I don't think
it was...

14:25.690 --> 14:29.172
- Who's this?
I'm sorry, who are you?

14:29.216 --> 14:30.826
- Who am I? Who are you?

14:30.870 --> 14:32.306
- Who is he?
-

14:32.349 --> 14:34.569
Look, guys, all's good
in the hood.

14:34.612 --> 14:36.136
All right, look.

14:36.179 --> 14:38.529
Barry, this is Deon.

14:38.573 --> 14:41.445
Still Force.

14:41.489 --> 14:43.186
And--and Deon,
this is Barry,

14:43.230 --> 14:45.362
who's actually--

14:45.406 --> 14:50.411
owner of this, uh,
fine establishment.

14:51.238 --> 14:53.544
- So you're the landlord.

14:53.588 --> 14:56.286
What's that got to do
with anything?

14:56.330 --> 14:58.375
- Deon...

14:58.419 --> 15:00.203
it's good to meet you.

15:00.247 --> 15:01.770
- Actually, you remember me?

15:01.813 --> 15:03.598
I was with him, you called us
one of the Urkels.

15:03.641 --> 15:05.556
- Oh, yeah...the cornballs.

15:05.600 --> 15:08.516
-
Cornball. He's so funny.

15:09.473 --> 15:10.910
- Who's the egghead?

15:12.476 --> 15:14.391
- Harrison Wells.

15:14.435 --> 15:16.132
I'm a fellow--

15:17.699 --> 15:20.920
Uh, visitor to Barry's place.

15:22.138 --> 15:25.881
- You know, y'all are being
real friendly right now.

15:25.925 --> 15:28.579
But I think--

15:28.623 --> 15:30.233
I think y'all are acting
like that

15:30.277 --> 15:32.627
because you're afraid of me.

15:34.411 --> 15:35.978
Now why is that?
- No, we're just...

15:36.022 --> 15:38.459
we're just making a--we're just
doing an experiment--

15:38.502 --> 15:40.156
- Shut up!

15:43.203 --> 15:50.471
<i>♪</i>

15:56.259 --> 15:58.261
Now...

15:58.305 --> 16:02.962
why do I get the feeling...

16:03.005 --> 16:05.573
you're reason I'm this way?

16:08.141 --> 16:11.274
- Because that's true.

16:11.318 --> 16:13.363
And I'm sorry.

16:13.407 --> 16:15.975
I never meant
for this to happen.

16:16.018 --> 16:19.239
So please let me fix it.
- Fix it?

16:19.282 --> 16:21.676
Fix it?
So I'm a mistake?

16:21.719 --> 16:25.027
- I didn't say that--
- You didn't have to.

16:26.681 --> 16:29.510
I can feel it.

16:33.688 --> 16:37.474
You want to destroy me.
- No, I want to save you.

16:37.518 --> 16:39.868
Deon....Deon.

16:41.696 --> 16:44.438
There are three other forces--
people like you.

16:44.481 --> 16:49.138
One of them?
She wants to kill you.

16:49.182 --> 16:52.011
Now, she's already killed
one of the other forces--

16:52.054 --> 16:54.578
the Strength Force,
and she didn't care

16:54.622 --> 16:59.366
when the person containing
that force died too.

16:59.409 --> 17:04.675
So I need to make it so the
Still Force never found you.

17:04.719 --> 17:07.287
It's the only way
to keep you safe.

17:10.725 --> 17:13.989
- Nah.

17:14.033 --> 17:16.035
I like being me.

17:23.694 --> 17:25.305
Oh, I get it.

17:27.046 --> 17:29.309
Oh, I get it.
- Yeah?

17:29.352 --> 17:30.832
- No, I get it. I get it.

17:30.875 --> 17:32.660
This is what you're gonna
use to do it, huh?

17:32.703 --> 17:33.878
This is what you're gonna use

17:33.922 --> 17:35.054
to make it like I neverexisted?

17:35.097 --> 17:37.360
- Not you,
just the force inside--

17:37.404 --> 17:39.928
- Man, I am that force!

17:41.756 --> 17:43.062
Do you have any idea
what it's like

17:43.105 --> 17:45.629
to be told that you
shouldn't be here?

17:48.937 --> 17:52.897
I never asked to be born.

17:52.941 --> 17:54.508
- Deon, listen to me.

17:54.551 --> 17:56.858
Look at what you're doing.

17:56.901 --> 17:59.339
Okay, you--you don't understand
what you are.

17:59.382 --> 18:03.125
- Yeah, I do.

18:04.735 --> 18:07.869
I'm a god.

18:07.912 --> 18:10.393
Maybe it's time
you understood that.

18:10.437 --> 18:11.699
- Deon, wait--

18:17.313 --> 18:19.272
- Time to bounce.

18:20.186 --> 18:21.970
-...right?

18:25.974 --> 18:28.194
- What the hell
just happened?

18:33.112 --> 18:35.723
- I think your friend Deon
just stopped time.

18:35.766 --> 18:37.594
- Yeah, he does that.

18:37.638 --> 18:40.031
- Why'd he leave?

18:40.075 --> 18:42.382
- Because I couldn't stop him.

18:49.519 --> 18:50.651
- Deon just aged the harness
a thousand years.

18:50.694 --> 18:54.350
How bad is it?
- Pretty bad.

18:54.394 --> 18:56.787
- But not hopeless.

18:56.831 --> 19:00.051
See I figured if we can find
some way to--

19:00.095 --> 19:02.750
somehow create some sort of...

19:05.666 --> 19:08.190
I was working on the collection
disc when Deon showed up.

19:08.234 --> 19:10.323
I figured I better hide it
just in case.

19:10.366 --> 19:12.368
-
Chester.

19:12.412 --> 19:13.456
You're a lifesaver.

19:13.500 --> 19:16.024
-
As for the vest,

19:16.067 --> 19:17.982
I'm used to working with junk.

19:18.026 --> 19:20.071
I'll just need a bunch of
replacement parts

19:20.115 --> 19:22.291
from my garage and she'll be up
and running in no time.

19:22.335 --> 19:26.077
With a little help, that is.
- I'm with you.

19:32.736 --> 19:34.347
- What's up?

19:35.870 --> 19:38.177
- I think Deon's right.

19:38.220 --> 19:39.874
We can't just...

19:39.917 --> 19:43.225
uncreate these forces
like that.

19:44.052 --> 19:45.923
- Uh--so what, we--we...

19:45.967 --> 19:48.709
we should just give up?

19:48.752 --> 19:50.493
- On this? Yeah, we give up.

19:50.537 --> 19:53.366
Doesn't that feel like
the right thing to do?

19:56.673 --> 19:58.980
- Cisco, Nora will kill him

19:59.023 --> 20:01.417
if I don't do something
to prevent it.

20:01.461 --> 20:03.332
Just like she killed Alexa.

20:03.376 --> 20:05.813
'Cause she's not gonna stop
until all the forces--

20:05.856 --> 20:09.164
and the people connected
to them--are dead.

20:09.208 --> 20:11.210
Why can't you see?
I'm trying to save him.

20:11.253 --> 20:13.864
- He doesn't want to be
saved by you!

20:13.908 --> 20:17.216
He just wants to be given
the chance to be himself.

20:19.522 --> 20:21.350
And Iris understood that.

20:21.394 --> 20:25.049
- Look, every second that we
leave these forces

20:25.093 --> 20:27.617
inside Deon and Psych,
people are in danger.

20:27.661 --> 20:29.880
It's only a matter of time
before someone dies

20:29.924 --> 20:31.447
in one of Psych's nightmares

20:31.491 --> 20:34.276
or gets killed by some kind
of Deon time anomaly.

20:34.320 --> 20:37.061
Not to mention Nora
declared war.

20:37.105 --> 20:39.063
She doesn't care how many
people she kills

20:39.107 --> 20:40.804
as long as the forces die.

20:40.848 --> 20:43.372
- You're right.
Yes, you're absolutely right.

20:43.416 --> 20:45.548
And something needs to be done
about that.

20:45.592 --> 20:47.942
And I don't have
all the answers.

20:47.985 --> 20:50.901
All I know is...

20:50.945 --> 20:53.904
this can't be it.

20:58.692 --> 21:00.911
- You guys understand, right?

21:00.955 --> 21:04.263
I--I have to uncreate
these forces.

21:05.960 --> 21:09.790
- Like I said, I am--I'm
Team Flash all the way.

21:11.444 --> 21:13.141
But...

21:13.184 --> 21:16.013
Cisco has a point, man.

21:19.669 --> 21:20.888
- Harrison?

21:20.931 --> 21:23.107
- If uncreating these forces is

21:23.151 --> 21:24.761
what you feel in your heart
is right,

21:24.805 --> 21:26.937
I'll take that voyage with you.

21:26.981 --> 21:31.855
But all I ask is that you
think--truly think

21:31.899 --> 21:34.554
about the choice you're making.

21:43.214 --> 21:45.478
- Please fix the harness.

21:49.525 --> 21:52.528
- Good luck.

22:01.929 --> 22:03.322
- Iris, you were right.

22:03.365 --> 22:06.412
These isotopic readings
are off the chart.

22:06.455 --> 22:08.544
- Where are we?

22:08.588 --> 22:10.067
- The old Allen house.

22:10.111 --> 22:13.897
This is where Barry's mom
was killed.

22:13.941 --> 22:17.336
He also said this is where the
Speed Force went when she died.

22:19.555 --> 22:22.993
- Whoa.
That old car is hella vintage.

22:23.037 --> 22:25.169
Almost looks brand new.

22:25.866 --> 22:28.347
- Must be a collector
or something.

22:28.390 --> 22:30.392
- We can ask him
when we're done.

22:30.436 --> 22:32.394
Assuming we survive.

22:38.444 --> 22:41.534
<i>- Caitlin called me
about Alexa.</i>

22:42.622 --> 22:44.450
- So it turns out,

22:44.493 --> 22:47.975
when Iris and I brought back
the Speed Force,

22:48.018 --> 22:52.283
we also created
three new forces.

22:53.459 --> 22:57.419
It's our fault that they're out
in the world hurting people.

22:57.463 --> 22:59.421
Killing them.

22:59.465 --> 23:01.380
So I feel like...

23:01.423 --> 23:04.600
I have to be the one
to take them out.

23:04.644 --> 23:06.994
- These forces.

23:07.037 --> 23:10.693
You think
they're above saving, too?

23:10.737 --> 23:16.046
- I think it would be safer for
everybody if they didn't exist.

23:16.873 --> 23:19.659
- You remember when Wally
first showed up?

23:19.702 --> 23:22.792
Man, it wasn't just that
I'd found out I have a son.

23:22.836 --> 23:24.403
I found out

23:24.446 --> 23:29.103
I have a son who kept getting
his butt in trouble.

23:29.146 --> 23:32.454
Boy, he was mad at the world.

23:32.498 --> 23:34.413
There was one point

23:34.456 --> 23:38.329
he said to me that he wished
he had never been born.

23:39.026 --> 23:44.074
So I tried to get close.

23:44.118 --> 23:46.120
And he pushed me away.

23:46.163 --> 23:48.731
I tried to give him space,

23:48.775 --> 23:50.907
then he felt abandoned.

23:50.951 --> 23:52.909
No parent is perfect.

23:52.953 --> 23:56.696
But one thing I never
stopped doing

23:56.739 --> 23:58.567
was trying.

23:58.611 --> 24:01.004
