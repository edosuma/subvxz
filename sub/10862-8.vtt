00:30.560 --> 00:32.000
Come on, guys.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
Full moon on a leap year.
Watch out.

00:34.000 --> 00:35.480
What's that
supposed to mean?

00:35.480 --> 00:37.000
Tonight's the night
the spirits are free

00:37.000 --> 00:38.480
to take
innocent victims away.

00:38.480 --> 00:40.680
Aw, come on.
You made that up.

00:42.560 --> 00:43.560
Shh!

00:54.600 --> 00:56.000
That's it.
I'm out of here!

00:56.000 --> 00:57.520
Wait, wait, wait.

01:02.520 --> 01:04.000
Guys.

01:07.960 --> 01:10.400
[Collective sigh]

01:13.520 --> 01:14.520
Great idea.

01:16.040 --> 01:17.520
Cool.

01:20.520 --> 01:21.960
What are you doing?

01:21.960 --> 01:23.960
Don't you know
about tonight?

01:23.960 --> 01:25.480
It's a full moon...

01:25.480 --> 01:27.280
On leap year.

01:27.280 --> 01:30.560
Oh, no.
Not you, too.

01:31.880 --> 01:34.480
This mask...
Within this circle...

01:34.480 --> 01:38.640
Is our only protection.

01:38.640 --> 01:41.840
Sounds like
a pretty dumb joke to me.

01:41.840 --> 01:45.000
You don't have
to believe me,

01:45.000 --> 01:48.080
but it's
an old superstition.

01:48.080 --> 01:53.640
My story takes place
on February 29th--

01:53.640 --> 01:55.000
leap year.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.520
It happens
every four years,

01:57.520 --> 02:01.520
and when it comes with
a full moon, watch out.

02:01.520 --> 02:05.440
The spirits who prowl
on a full moon leap year

02:05.440 --> 02:07.960
are hunting,

02:07.960 --> 02:11.560
and it may be for you.

02:18.040 --> 02:21.960
Submitted for the approval
of the Midnight Society,

02:21.960 --> 02:24.040
I call this story...

02:42.040 --> 02:45.480
Claire and Andrew Dickens
were on their way home

02:45.480 --> 02:48.480
from a trip to
the amusement park with Louise,

02:48.480 --> 02:50.440
their favorite babysitter.

02:50.440 --> 02:53.000
Aw, the laugh in the dark
ride was awesome.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
When zebo jumped out,
I almost croaked.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.480
You're so childish.

02:57.480 --> 02:59.000
Be nice,
little schmunkins,

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
or I won't take you
to Molly's.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.440
Banana Splits!

03:02.440 --> 03:03.920
All you can eat!

03:03.920 --> 03:07.840
Only if you're good
and stop fighting.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.960
Ah, your teeth
are going to rot.

03:20.960 --> 03:22.960
At least I don't have
onion breath,

03:22.960 --> 03:24.440
miss hot dog.

03:24.440 --> 03:26.960
Remember, love is greatest
when words are few.

03:26.960 --> 03:28.480
What does that mean?

03:28.480 --> 03:30.280
It means shut up.

03:43.040 --> 03:44.480
That's strange.

03:44.480 --> 03:48.000
I thought the number 9
highway was back there.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
Isn't that sign
supposed to be blue?

03:51.000 --> 03:52.480
What do you know?

03:52.480 --> 03:54.480
Let's just go.
I'm hungry.

03:54.480 --> 03:56.040
You're always hungry.

04:20.200 --> 04:23.120
Oh, I don't recognize
any of this.

04:23.120 --> 04:25.000
I need to get directions.

04:48.680 --> 04:53.040
Hello? Hello?
Anyone here?

04:56.240 --> 04:58.000
This place is creepy.
I'm gone.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.840
[Man]
Shut that door!

05:03.040 --> 05:07.040
I... loathe drafts.

05:07.040 --> 05:08.920
Sorry. We don't mean
to bother you,

05:08.920 --> 05:10.520
but we're lost.

05:10.520 --> 05:11.760
Lost?

05:13.000 --> 05:17.760
But you're precisely...
on time.

05:21.320 --> 05:24.360
We're looking for highway 9
to Victor Heights.

05:24.360 --> 05:25.560
Highway 9?

05:30.840 --> 05:33.560
You've strayed quite far.

05:35.440 --> 05:37.960
But I know a shortcut.

05:37.960 --> 05:41.480
Take the dirt road
outside.

05:41.480 --> 05:43.960
It travels
through the woods

05:43.960 --> 05:48.600
and will cut... miles
off your trip.

05:48.600 --> 05:50.520
[Whirring]

05:50.520 --> 05:52.120
[Chimes ring]

05:52.120 --> 05:55.760
Anything else...
I can do for you?

05:59.360 --> 06:01.480
No, but thanks
for your help.

06:05.840 --> 06:06.920
Ha ha ha!

06:08.960 --> 06:10.360
What a creep.

06:10.360 --> 06:12.440
He was just a little
eccentric, that's all.

06:12.440 --> 06:14.440
Eccentric?
What does that mean?

06:14.440 --> 06:16.480
It means
he was a creep.

06:41.040 --> 06:43.040
[Engine dies]

06:47.600 --> 06:49.520
[Engine not starting]

06:51.040 --> 06:53.480
Did we run
out of gas?

06:53.480 --> 06:55.960
No. I don't know
what happened.

06:55.960 --> 06:58.480
We'll never have
Banana Splits.

06:58.480 --> 06:59.960
We're stuck here,

06:59.960 --> 07:02.480
and all you can
think about is eating?

07:04.480 --> 07:08.080
Let's ask if we can
use their phone.

07:11.760 --> 07:14.440
Why don't we walk
back to that tavern

07:14.440 --> 07:16.720
and use their phone?

07:16.720 --> 07:20.440
Because we can
use the one here.

07:20.440 --> 07:21.440
Come on.

07:21.440 --> 07:23.440
I don't want to go.

07:23.440 --> 07:24.920
Why? You scared?

07:24.920 --> 07:26.120
No.

07:26.120 --> 07:28.440
Don't move. I'll
be back in a flash.

07:28.440 --> 07:29.640
Chicken.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.520
[Creaking]

08:04.480 --> 08:06.960
She should be back
by now.

08:08.320 --> 08:10.400
I'm going in.

08:10.400 --> 08:12.960
But Louise said
to wait here.

08:14.480 --> 08:16.480
You really are
chicken.

08:20.480 --> 08:21.440
I won.

08:21.440 --> 08:22.920
Winner has to knock.

08:22.920 --> 08:25.000
No way. Loser does.

09:00.520 --> 09:01.960
Louise.

09:03.480 --> 09:04.400
Shh. Listen.

09:04.400 --> 09:05.880
[Creaking]

09:05.880 --> 09:07.480
It's her!

09:22.480 --> 09:24.480
I don't like
haunted houses.

09:26.440 --> 09:28.480
[Music box playing]

09:55.520 --> 09:56.960
It's a party!

09:56.960 --> 09:58.520
Awesome!

10:00.040 --> 10:01.440
Excellent,
I'm starved.

10:01.440 --> 10:03.960
Louise planned this.
I know it.

10:03.960 --> 10:06.440
Come on out, Louise.

10:06.440 --> 10:08.040
Hey, let me try some.

10:08.040 --> 10:10.440
Get your own!

10:10.440 --> 10:13.240
Look what you made
me do now, dork.

[Sizzling]

10:25.560 --> 10:27.560
Ha ha ha!

10:48.560 --> 10:50.520
Do you realize we could
be dead right now?

10:50.520 --> 10:52.520
Good thing you were
a pig

10:52.520 --> 10:55.000
and tried to eat
my ice cream.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
So, what do we do now?

10:57.000 --> 10:58.520
Well, I don't know.

10:58.520 --> 11:00.520
I guess we'll have to
go back to that tavern

11:00.520 --> 11:02.440
and ask that guy
for help.

11:02.440 --> 11:03.960
I thought you said
he was a creep.

11:03.960 --> 11:06.000
Do you have
a better idea?

11:16.120 --> 11:17.520
[Music playing]

Excuse me.

11:34.160 --> 11:36.000
[Music stops]

11:39.560 --> 11:42.640
We came from
that house in the woods.

11:44.320 --> 11:48.360
Louise, our babysitter,

11:48.360 --> 11:51.480
I think
she's lost there.

11:51.480 --> 11:54.000
There, there, dearie.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.560
Have some punch.

11:58.080 --> 11:59.680
[Music starts]

12:04.360 --> 12:05.960
No, thank you.

12:05.960 --> 12:07.680
Uh, can you
help us?

12:07.680 --> 12:08.960
Relax, darling.

12:08.960 --> 12:10.440
That nanny of yours,

12:10.440 --> 12:11.960
she'll be fine...

12:11.960 --> 12:14.440
Once the sun sets.

12:14.440 --> 12:17.280
Now, you know
that's not true.

12:17.280 --> 12:18.480
What do you mean?

12:18.480 --> 12:19.960
It's leap year...

12:19.960 --> 12:21.800
And a full moon.

12:21.800 --> 12:23.720
We wouldn't
be here otherwise,

12:23.720 --> 12:24.800
would we?

12:27.040 --> 12:28.480
You remind me so much

12:28.480 --> 12:30.520
of my dear little Jane.

12:30.520 --> 12:31.360
So sad.

12:33.000 --> 12:33.840
So sad.

12:36.560 --> 12:37.960
Pay no attention.

12:37.960 --> 12:39.560
They're just
pulling your leg.

12:39.560 --> 12:40.480
About what?

12:40.480 --> 12:42.000
I don't get it.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.480
Lighten up there,
little sister.

12:43.480 --> 12:45.000
It's a party.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.800
The sun's going down,
and we can live.

12:46.800 --> 12:48.480
Who lives
in that house?

12:48.480 --> 12:50.000
Better question is,

12:50.000 --> 12:52.480
who's the house
living in?

12:52.480 --> 12:54.480
It's master
Raymond's house--

12:54.480 --> 12:56.480
has been for years

12:56.480 --> 12:58.480
and for years to come.

12:58.480 --> 13:00.080
Want to buy a brush?

13:02.520 --> 13:03.920
What a bunch
of Loony Tunes.

13:03.920 --> 13:05.920
What are we
going to do?

13:05.920 --> 13:06.920
Go home.

13:06.920 --> 13:07.920
How?

13:07.920 --> 13:09.440
What about Louise?

13:09.440 --> 13:11.440
We'll call
Mom and Dad.

13:11.440 --> 13:12.960
They'll come
and pick us up.

13:12.960 --> 13:14.960
Did they have
a phone in there?

13:14.960 --> 13:15.960
They must.

13:15.960 --> 13:17.080
Come on.

13:21.200 --> 13:23.040
Excuse me,
could we use your...

13:30.520 --> 13:31.960
Where did they
all go?

13:31.960 --> 13:33.480
I don't know.

13:33.480 --> 13:34.480
Claire,
this is weird.

13:34.480 --> 13:35.960
What are we
going to do?

13:35.960 --> 13:38.480
There's only one thing
we can do.

13:38.480 --> 13:40.520
We got to go
get Louise.

[Creaking]

14:00.680 --> 14:02.680
[Whispering voices]

14:05.680 --> 14:07.640
Maybe she
already left.

14:07.640 --> 14:09.640
But her car's
still outside.

14:09.640 --> 14:11.680
[Whispering voice]
...Forever!

14:11.680 --> 14:14.600
You will never
leave this house!

[Laughter]

14:15.720 --> 14:18.160
[Louise]
Claire. Andrew.

14:18.160 --> 14:20.520
Are you there?

14:24.640 --> 14:25.600

14:25.600 --> 14:27.600
Louise, is that you?

14:27.600 --> 14:29.160
[Louise]
Over here.

14:30.640 --> 14:32.640
In the living room.

14:41.160 --> 14:43.600
I'm over here.

14:43.600 --> 14:45.120

14:45.120 --> 14:47.120
I'm upstairs.

14:47.120 --> 14:49.600
Please come help me.

14:49.600 --> 14:51.000
Please.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.600
How did you get
in there?

14:52.600 --> 14:54.600
Ha ha ha!

14:54.600 --> 14:56.120
Aah!
Aah!

14:59.200 --> 15:00.640
[Claire]
That guy!

15:00.640 --> 15:03.640
He's from the tavern. He
must be Master Raymond.

15:03.640 --> 15:05.520
Who cares? He was
a creep, remember?

15:05.520 --> 15:07.000
Now he's a ghost creep!

15:07.000 --> 15:09.040
We have to
find Louise.

15:09.040 --> 15:11.120
How about you find her,
I stay here?

15:11.120 --> 15:11.840
No.

15:11.840 --> 15:13.480
I need you.

15:13.480 --> 15:15.480
You do?

15:15.480 --> 15:18.120
Yeah.
Y-you're smart.

15:18.120 --> 15:21.320
You think of the
things that I don't.

15:23.160 --> 15:25.320
Yeah. Yeah.
I do, don't I?

15:25.320 --> 15:28.160
Come on. We have
to look upstairs.

15:44.440 --> 15:46.680
It's OK.
Come on.

16:18.560 --> 16:20.120
[Humming]

16:20.120 --> 16:23.480
Louise,
is that you?

16:23.480 --> 16:25.080
Of course,
little schmunkin head.

16:25.080 --> 16:27.040
Come in.

16:27.040 --> 16:28.560
It really is you.

16:28.560 --> 16:29.920
What happened?

16:29.920 --> 16:31.560
Don't worry.

16:31.560 --> 16:32.560
I'm OK.

16:32.560 --> 16:34.560
I found
this little baby,

16:34.560 --> 16:37.400
and we can go just as soon
as he's asleep.

16:37.400 --> 16:39.600
I thought for sure
that you were hurt

16:39.600 --> 16:40.680
or even--

16:40.680 --> 16:43.080
No. I'm fine.

16:43.080 --> 16:46.240
I've... never been better.

16:47.840 --> 16:50.720
It's
Master Raymond.

[Deep voice]
Here. This is for you!

16:54.080 --> 16:55.480
Aah!

[Maniacal laughter]

17:03.680 --> 17:05.240
Andrew!

17:14.200 --> 17:17.640
You so remind me of
my dear little Jane.

17:17.640 --> 17:21.040
So sad. So sad.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.119
Aah!

Yes?

17:36.160 --> 17:37.560
Help me.

17:37.560 --> 17:39.560
Louise?

17:39.560 --> 17:43.080
It's me.
It's really me.

17:43.080 --> 17:44.640
I'm trapped.

17:54.560 --> 17:57.680
Claire! Louise!

18:03.680 --> 18:05.720
Hey, guys,
the door's open.

18:14.680 --> 18:16.600
Shut that door.

18:16.600 --> 18:19.120
He hates drafts!

18:41.720 --> 18:43.200
Louise?

18:46.720 --> 18:48.160
Claire!

18:48.160 --> 18:49.880
Andrew?

18:49.880 --> 18:51.320
[Andrew]
Where are you?

18:51.320 --> 18:52.720
[Claire] I'm on the
other side of the wall.

18:52.720 --> 18:54.600
I found Louise.

18:54.600 --> 18:56.080
Go to the candlesticks.

18:56.080 --> 18:57.640
Pull on them--

18:57.640 --> 18:59.400
hard. Hurry.

19:03.200 --> 19:05.200
[Laughing maniacally]

19:18.760 --> 19:19.680
Cool!

19:19.680 --> 19:21.160
Come on.

19:23.200 --> 19:24.800
Welcome.

19:24.800 --> 19:27.080
Leave her alone.
She's coming with us.

19:27.080 --> 19:31.640
Big words
for such a small boy.

19:31.640 --> 19:33.640
I'm not small, and
I'm not scared of you.

19:33.640 --> 19:35.720
[Master Raymond]
No matter.

19:35.720 --> 19:37.120
When the sun sets,

19:37.120 --> 19:41.200
her soul... will be mine.

19:43.720 --> 19:45.120
[Claire]
Who are you?

19:45.120 --> 19:46.640
What do you want?

19:46.640 --> 19:49.160
Her energy
will keep me alive,

19:49.160 --> 19:52.640
keep this house alive,

19:52.640 --> 19:56.640
and she'll be
part of us...

19:56.640 --> 19:58.320
forever.

19:58.320 --> 20:00.640
You're
a monster.

20:00.640 --> 20:04.040
[Master Raymond] I would
choose my words carefully

20:04.040 --> 20:06.240
if I were you,

20:06.240 --> 20:10.240
or you...
might be next.

20:10.240 --> 20:12.000
Don't touch that!

20:12.000 --> 20:13.800
Take a hike,
buddy.

20:16.720 --> 20:18.160
Where did he go?

20:18.160 --> 20:19.920
Who cares?
Let's bolt.

20:26.680 --> 20:28.680
Hurry up.
He'll come back.

20:43.640 --> 20:46.640
There's no use
in running.

20:46.640 --> 20:50.120
The sun is almost down.

20:50.120 --> 20:51.120
She...

20:51.120 --> 20:52.640
is...

20:52.640 --> 20:54.560
mine.

20:54.560 --> 20:56.640
Don't count
on it, buddy.

20:56.640 --> 20:58.640
[Master Raymond laughs]

20:58.640 --> 21:03.000
Silly boy
with silly toys.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.720
You won't
fool me again.

21:10.720 --> 21:14.160
Come along, dear.

21:14.160 --> 21:15.880
[Andrew]
Louise.

21:17.480 --> 21:21.600
You, too... little one.

21:23.680 --> 21:24.520
Claire!

21:26.320 --> 21:30.600
Run along,
little boy.

21:30.600 --> 21:33.120
They're mine now.

21:33.120 --> 21:35.120
Ha ha ha!

21:35.120 --> 21:37.680
[Woman]
No!

21:41.480 --> 21:43.120
Violet...

21:43.120 --> 21:45.000
What are you doing?

21:45.000 --> 21:47.480
I won't let you
do this.

21:47.480 --> 21:51.240
You dare go against
my wishes?

21:51.240 --> 21:53.120
They're so young.

21:53.120 --> 21:56.120
This is not
your concern.

21:56.120 --> 21:58.880
Return to the walls.

21:58.880 --> 22:02.960
She's so like
my poor little Jane.

22:02.960 --> 22:03.960
Violet, no!

22:03.960 --> 22:05.280
No!

22:05.280 --> 22:06.280
Aah!

22:09.520 --> 22:11.840
What happened?

22:11.840 --> 22:13.000
Go quickly!

22:14.240 --> 22:16.120
Thank you.

22:22.880 --> 22:24.600
Still want
Banana Splits?

22:24.600 --> 22:26.600
[Claire and Andrew] No!
Let's get out of here!

22:26.600 --> 22:27.600
Yes!

22:27.600 --> 22:29.360
It works!
Punch it.

22:44.680 --> 22:46.200
[Engine not starting]

23:04.200 --> 23:06.640
The house still stands,

23:06.640 --> 23:08.120
and to this day,

23:08.120 --> 23:12.160
people still disappear
when the moon is full

23:12.160 --> 23:14.840
on February 29th.

23:24.520 --> 23:26.840
Ah, time to go.

23:26.840 --> 23:29.080
Y-you go first.

23:29.080 --> 23:32.600
Uh, no. After you.

23:32.600 --> 23:35.120
Not me.
You go, Frank.

23:35.120 --> 23:37.120
[Frank] I'll go
after Gary goes.

23:37.120 --> 23:38.600
[Gary]
I'm not going first.
