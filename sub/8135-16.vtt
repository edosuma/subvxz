00:00.967 --> 00:04.403
I've programmed KITT with everything
imaginable on Royce's publishing empire.

00:04.471 --> 00:08.032
- Including the centerfolds?
- Boy, what I wouldn't give to have one of these.

00:08.108 --> 00:11.703
- They're turning the man's
death into a circus.

00:11.778 --> 00:17.273
- You sure you can handle me?
- I'll do the champagne, and then we'll see what else comes to mind.

00:20.020 --> 00:22.454
I have an unidentified
speeding object on Runway 2.

00:23.857 --> 00:26.883
Be careful, Michael.

00:27.827 --> 00:29.886
Shake him loose.

00:41.708 --> 00:46.805
Knight Rider, a shadowy flight
into the dangerous world of a man...

00:46.880 --> 00:48.905
who does not exist.

00:59.959 --> 01:01.950
Michael Knight, a young loner...

01:02.028 --> 01:04.553
on a crusade to champion
the cause of the innocent,

01:04.631 --> 01:07.657
the helpless,
the powerless,

01:07.734 --> 01:11.295
in a world of criminals
who operate above the law.

01:55.048 --> 01:58.745
Hold it. Yeah?

01:58.818 --> 02:02.219
It's me.
Two seconds, honey.

02:02.288 --> 02:07.419
It's my daughter. Stay on top
of it, and we'll talk tomorrow.

02:12.198 --> 02:17.295
When a magazine throws a party, guests
expect to see a mingling publisher.

02:17.370 --> 02:21.170
I'm sorry, honey. Give me
just another 20 more minutes.

02:21.241 --> 02:23.368
Real time or Philip Royce time?

02:23.443 --> 02:25.638
Real time for a change.
Oh.

02:25.712 --> 02:27.737
By the way,
I'm expecting somebody.

02:27.814 --> 02:30.442
Devon Miles. I think he'll
be coming with a young lady.

02:30.517 --> 02:32.883
So when he arrives,
just send him right up.

02:32.952 --> 02:35.512
It's important, okay?

02:35.588 --> 02:38.580
All right.
Real time my eye.

02:46.599 --> 02:49.090
Hello.
Please don't hang up.

02:49.169 --> 02:53.299
I know it's been a long time, and I
know there's nothing between us anymore,

02:53.373 --> 02:56.069
but I need to talk to you.

02:58.811 --> 03:00.972
I need a picture.

03:03.917 --> 03:08.251
Hi. I'm glad you could make it.
It's good to see you.

03:08.321 --> 03:11.586
Excuse me. Would you call me
tomorrow? I really need to talk to you.

03:11.658 --> 03:14.252
Not even out of diapers,
and she's running the show.

03:14.327 --> 03:17.194
Paul! Hi!
How are you?

03:17.263 --> 03:19.424
I thought you couldn't make it. I
couldn't. I can't, but I'm here anyway.

03:19.499 --> 03:21.433
I've got terrific news.
What?

03:21.501 --> 03:24.163
Our market research team says
that our adds in Escape...

03:24.237 --> 03:27.263
are 60 percent more effective
than any other print media.

03:27.340 --> 03:31.071
I told you. We're changing
our image and our demographics.

03:31.144 --> 03:36.741
You stick with us, and Parkway
Pharmaceuticals will make Fortune 500.

03:36.816 --> 03:39.751
I'm sorry, sir. I cannot find
your name on the guest list.

03:39.819 --> 03:42.049
If you'll be good enough
to call Mr. Royce,

03:42.121 --> 03:44.055
he'll clear up
this misunderstanding.

03:44.123 --> 03:48.753
- Excuse me. Is there a problem?
- My guest and I were invited by Philip Royce personally.

03:48.828 --> 03:51.456
Apparently we're not
on the guest list.

03:51.531 --> 03:54.557
I'm sorry.
Are you Devon Miles?

03:54.634 --> 03:56.761
I am.
And this is Miss Barstow.

03:56.836 --> 03:59.805
Oh, forgive me. I'm Anne Tyler,
Philip's personal secretary.

03:59.872 --> 04:02.033
He is expecting you.
Will you please follow me?

04:02.108 --> 04:04.042
Thank you.

04:04.110 --> 04:07.045
Lauren, I found him.
Oh, thank you.

04:09.282 --> 04:11.580
I hardly recognized you
with your clothes on.

04:11.651 --> 04:14.245
What did you say?

04:14.320 --> 04:17.778
Didn't I shoot you last year,
Miss June?

04:17.857 --> 04:20.553
I think you've got
the wrong young lady.

04:20.627 --> 04:22.822
Or the wrong month.

04:31.537 --> 04:35.371
Philip, they're here...
Mr. Miles and Miss Barstow.

04:36.976 --> 04:39.536
Philip?

05:54.921 --> 05:59.255
As you see, Michael, they're turning
the man's death into a circus.

05:59.325 --> 06:02.226
Given the circumstances,
I can understand why.

06:02.295 --> 06:05.856
What's our tie-in
with this, uh, Philip Royce?

06:05.932 --> 06:10.028
Royce called two days ago. He wanted the
Foundation's help on a story he was researching.

06:10.103 --> 06:13.402
- What kind of help?
- We weren't able to find out.

06:13.473 --> 06:17.102
However, I got the impression from the
telephone call that the story was an expose.

06:17.176 --> 06:20.634
If you're right about that, all we gotta do
is find out who he was trying to expose...

06:20.713 --> 06:22.738
and we've got our prime suspect.
Correct.

06:22.815 --> 06:27.377
- Does the story have a title?
- He referred to it by a code name... Topaz.

06:29.922 --> 06:32.117
Did you run that through
the computers? Nothing.

06:32.191 --> 06:35.957
The word doesn't seem to connect to anything
in Royce's personal or corporate life.

06:36.028 --> 06:38.189
It is, however, a birthstone.

06:39.332 --> 06:41.323
Mine.

06:44.537 --> 06:48.473
Uh, November 24. I'm sorry.
I forgot your birthday, didn't I?

06:48.541 --> 06:52.307
Well, you were on assignment.
Don't worry. I covered for you.

06:52.378 --> 06:54.471
- Tastefully?
- Of course.

06:56.482 --> 06:59.007
Okay, guys.
Thanks a lot.

07:00.019 --> 07:02.487
Topaz.

07:02.555 --> 07:06.355
- Where do I start?
- With his daughter, Lauren.

07:06.426 --> 07:08.360
They were very close.

07:08.428 --> 07:11.761
I've programmed KITT with everything
imaginable on Royce's publishing empire...

07:11.831 --> 07:14.595
along with all the past issues
of Escape magazine.

07:14.667 --> 07:18.103
- Including the centerfolds?
- I anticipated your every need.

08:09.255 --> 08:11.246
Michael.

08:12.291 --> 08:14.350
Uh, yeah?

08:14.427 --> 08:17.988
Why are all those young ladies
running around in such skimpy attire?

08:18.064 --> 08:21.397
When I find out,
you'll be the first to know.

08:26.973 --> 08:29.635
Okay. Now over here.

08:32.845 --> 08:34.836
This must be the new car.

08:38.818 --> 08:41.616
Boy, what I wouldn't give
to have one of these.

09:04.076 --> 09:06.067
Very good.

09:09.448 --> 09:12.975
I know some marksmen who'd like to
trade their bull's-eyes for yours.

09:14.053 --> 09:16.112
Wow.

09:16.188 --> 09:18.179
I just might be one of them.

09:21.093 --> 09:23.687
Hi. I'm Michael Knight.

09:23.763 --> 09:26.357
I believe Devon Miles
called about me.

09:29.001 --> 09:33.438
Miss Royce. Lauren.

09:33.506 --> 09:35.838
I'm here to see if I can help
find out what happened to your dad.

09:40.379 --> 09:42.313
I'm not a cop.

09:42.381 --> 09:45.350
I'm your friend.
I'm on your side.

09:47.486 --> 09:50.819
I need some information
about Topaz.

09:52.525 --> 09:57.019
- All right. What do you wanna know?
- I wanna know about the story your dad was working on.

09:57.096 --> 10:00.259
- The story he called the Foundation and Devon Miles about.
- Topaz.

10:00.333 --> 10:02.460
Yeah, Topaz. That's right.

10:02.535 --> 10:04.765
It's all in this computer...

10:04.837 --> 10:08.170
the story, the research,
documentation, names,

10:08.240 --> 10:10.231
times, places.

10:14.213 --> 10:16.613
"Topaz...
Enter six-digit access code."

10:16.682 --> 10:20.812
- Do you know anything about computers?
- A little.

10:20.886 --> 10:24.219
Without the access code,
the story's unreachable.

10:24.290 --> 10:27.350
- It might as well not even exist.
- You don't have it?

10:27.426 --> 10:29.826
Nobody has it.

10:29.895 --> 10:32.090
It died with my father.

10:32.164 --> 10:35.656
It was his way of guaranteeing
security for his story...

10:35.735 --> 10:38.169
and for his family and his friends.

10:42.608 --> 10:44.906
What no one knows
could never hurt them.

10:44.977 --> 10:46.672
Exactly.

10:46.746 --> 10:50.341
So they hurt him instead.

10:52.318 --> 10:54.309
When you think of Philip Royce,
what do you think of?

10:54.387 --> 10:57.948
Don't say it.
I'll say it for you.

10:58.024 --> 11:00.049
Ah.

11:00.126 --> 11:04.893
Glamour and sex!
Fashion and sex.

11:04.964 --> 11:07.933
Cars and sex. A glossy,
air-brushed girlie magazine, huh?

11:08.000 --> 11:10.969
I feel like I should say,
"Guilty as charged."

11:11.037 --> 11:14.063
Say whatever you want. All I care
about is vindicating my father's death.

11:14.140 --> 11:16.335
I didn't know
it needed vindication.

11:16.409 --> 11:19.901
You're just like all the rest.

11:19.979 --> 11:22.243
"Philip Royce,
bon vivant, womanizer...

11:22.314 --> 11:25.306
"who turned an avocation
into a profession,

11:25.384 --> 11:28.842
is found murdered in a hotel suite
with a younger woman."

11:29.855 --> 11:32.050
Makes perfect sense.
After all,

11:32.124 --> 11:35.025
those who live by the sword
die by the sword.

11:35.094 --> 11:38.928
- Why are you so angry?
- Because that is what everybody believes!

11:38.998 --> 11:41.091
That's his epitaph.

11:42.101 --> 11:44.092
He was my dad.

11:48.074 --> 11:52.773
Few people knew the real
Philip Royce, the serious journalist,

11:52.845 --> 11:55.905
the man who, when he turned 50,

11:55.981 --> 11:59.781
came into my room crying, telling me
that he would rather sell Escape...

11:59.852 --> 12:01.786
than have it continue
the way it had.

12:03.589 --> 12:06.183
He wanted to turn it
into something different.

12:08.194 --> 12:11.960
Topaz... Topaz was to be
the new beginning.

12:14.166 --> 12:17.567
But by killing him
the way they did,

12:17.636 --> 12:20.196
they not only took his life,

12:20.272 --> 12:24.333
they took his reputation,
his credibility,

12:24.410 --> 12:26.401
his dignity.

12:28.614 --> 12:31.082
I'm not gonna let them
get away with it.

12:31.150 --> 12:36.178
And if I have to finish Topaz myself
to get those things back, I will.

12:38.958 --> 12:42.519
Excuse me. Hello?

12:42.595 --> 12:44.995
- Lauren Royce?
- Yes. Who's this?

12:45.064 --> 12:48.591
My name is George Olin. I was
working with your father on Topaz.

12:48.667 --> 12:50.658
Just a minute, please.

12:53.172 --> 12:55.231
This is a personal call.

12:55.307 --> 12:58.765
Thank you very much for coming by. If I
need your help, I know where to find you.

13:00.412 --> 13:04.439
Lauren, um,
I'm sorry about your dad.

13:09.288 --> 13:12.257
Do you know who killed my
father? I've got a good idea.

13:12.324 --> 13:14.849
Meet me.
I'll fill you in on the details.

13:51.163 --> 13:53.563
Thanks, Kent.
I'll get back by myself.

14:01.307 --> 14:04.401
Michael, there's an armed man
on a rooftop down the street.

14:04.476 --> 14:06.171
Lauren!

14:09.748 --> 14:12.581
KITT, get over here!

14:12.651 --> 14:15.245
No!

14:19.191 --> 14:21.182
Wait here.
I'll be right back.

15:00.232 --> 15:03.167
He got away.

15:03.235 --> 15:06.295
- I'm sorry, Michael.
- That's okay, pal.

15:07.306 --> 15:09.297
We can't win 'em all.

15:19.218 --> 15:21.652
Just like I told you, they
believe what they wanna believe.

15:21.720 --> 15:23.654
Come on.

15:23.722 --> 15:26.384
They deal in facts. We can't
give them facts, just theories.

15:26.458 --> 15:28.392
George Olin is not a theory.

15:28.460 --> 15:30.394
What I'm trying to say
is that's to our advantage.

15:30.462 --> 15:32.760
We're not limited to facts.
If we put our heads together,

15:32.831 --> 15:36.028
there's a good chance we can
figure this out by ourselves, okay?

15:36.101 --> 15:38.262
Okay. Okay, now, work
with me, all right?

15:38.337 --> 15:41.431
Let's reconstruct the last
couple days of your dad's life.

15:41.507 --> 15:44.943
Where'd he go? Who'd he see?
"Where" is easy. Las Vegas.

15:45.010 --> 15:47.740
Business or pleasure?
I'm not sure.

15:47.813 --> 15:50.008
I mean, he went up on Tuesday,
came back on Wednesday.

15:50.082 --> 15:52.812
Did he go alone?

15:52.885 --> 15:55.649
I don't know,
but we can find out.

16:22.548 --> 16:26.416
Amazing.
It's like mission control.

16:26.485 --> 16:29.010
I'm into gadgets.
Oh, there's Don.

16:31.490 --> 16:33.822
Michael, I'm not a gadget.

16:33.892 --> 16:36.019
I am a state-of-the-art.

16:36.095 --> 16:40.191
I know. Give me a state-of-the-art
composite on one George Olin.

16:40.265 --> 16:43.234
O-L-I-N. Hard copy, please.

16:48.073 --> 16:50.064
Thanks.

16:54.546 --> 16:56.707
Don, this is Michael Knight.
How you doing, Mike?

16:56.782 --> 16:58.716
Hi, Don. Nice to meet
you. Nice to meet you.

16:58.784 --> 17:01.344
Dad did take someone with him
to Vegas, but he came back alone.

17:01.420 --> 17:04.287
A Mr. Williams.
Mr. Williams, huh?

17:04.356 --> 17:06.950
Any chance that's Mr. Williams?

17:07.026 --> 17:08.960
Mm-hmm. That's him.

17:09.028 --> 17:11.019
Hang on.
I'll be right back.

17:13.732 --> 17:16.359
- KITT, patch me through to Devon.
- Good news?

17:16.435 --> 17:20.303
Right now any news
is good news. Michael?

17:20.372 --> 17:23.739
Devon, give me all you got
on a man named George Olin.

17:23.809 --> 17:27.404
O-L-I-N. He's working for Royce
under an assumed name.

17:34.653 --> 17:36.644
I'll call you right back.

17:54.907 --> 17:58.934
I have an unidentified speeding object
on Runway 2. Did you see it?

18:05.818 --> 18:09.117
KITT, plot me a route to Las Vegas
off major highways.

18:09.188 --> 18:11.748
Right away, Michael.

18:30.008 --> 18:33.273
KITT, get me Devon.
Hello?

18:33.345 --> 18:37.042
Devon, it's Michael.
Our lady publisher ran out on me.

18:37.116 --> 18:40.085
- You lost her?
- That pretty well sums it up.

18:40.152 --> 18:44.282
- How'd you do with George Olin?
- He was a private investigator, but don't get your hopes up.

18:44.356 --> 18:47.723
Devon, if he was an investigator,
he had files.

18:47.793 --> 18:50.057
What he had was
a photographic memory.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.290
That was his trademark.
No files.

18:52.364 --> 18:54.298
Wonderful.
I'll call you from Las Vegas.

18:54.366 --> 18:56.357
I got a plane to catch.

19:05.344 --> 19:07.335
Welcome to Las Vegas, KITT,

19:07.412 --> 19:10.404
the land of the pot of gold
at the end of the rainbow.

19:10.482 --> 19:13.042
Michael, would you draw
to an inside straight?

19:13.118 --> 19:15.348
I've been doing it all my life, KITT.

19:43.582 --> 19:45.516
Don, thank you.
Appreciate it.

19:45.584 --> 19:48.712
Hi. Need a lift?

19:48.787 --> 19:51.779
No. How did you get here
ahead of me?

19:51.857 --> 19:53.848
You didn't drive all the way?

19:53.926 --> 19:57.384
I think we've got more important
things to talk about,

19:57.462 --> 20:01.592
like you and me and some ground
rules for working together.

20:01.667 --> 20:03.601
I didn't know
we were working together.

20:03.669 --> 20:06.399
I gathered that when you
took off at the airport.

20:06.471 --> 20:08.666
So that's the first thing
we gotta decide here.

20:08.740 --> 20:12.267
Now, either we are working together,
or we aren't working together.

20:12.344 --> 20:15.438
If we aren't working together,
all you gotta do is say the word,

20:15.514 --> 20:17.505
and I'm outta here.

20:20.752 --> 20:23.721
You sure you can handle me?
No.

20:23.789 --> 20:26.451
You sure you can handle me?

20:26.525 --> 20:28.516
No.

20:56.989 --> 21:01.426
Uh, use the V.I.P. parking.
It goes with the territory.

21:01.493 --> 21:03.484
Terrific.

21:10.102 --> 21:12.036
Thanks, Smitty.

21:40.299 --> 21:42.290
I'll let them know
that we're here.

21:46.471 --> 21:48.632
KITT, I'm gonna be a while.
Go into surveillance mode.

21:51.576 --> 21:55.569
Michael, my sensors are picking up
some very strange vibrations.

21:55.647 --> 21:57.979
Oh, yeah. It's probably
the one-armed bandits.

21:58.050 --> 22:00.518
- Shall we pursue them?
- No.

22:00.585 --> 22:03.418
No, that's, uh,
just a figure of speech.

22:33.919 --> 22:35.853
This must be my lucky day.

22:35.921 --> 22:39.379
Mine too.

22:46.231 --> 22:48.597
Welcome to the Escape suite.

22:49.601 --> 22:51.967
It's very nice.
Thank you.

22:54.106 --> 22:56.597
Is that thing hooked up
to the computer in L.A?

22:57.809 --> 22:59.800
Probably.

23:04.449 --> 23:06.576
All right. Let's see here.

23:12.991 --> 23:15.255
"Topaz.
Enter six-digit access code."

23:26.071 --> 23:28.665
Bob.

23:28.740 --> 23:31.368
How sweet.

23:31.443 --> 23:35.743
I can't tell you how bad we all felt
about, uh, you know, what happened.

23:35.814 --> 23:38.612
I know. Thank you.

23:38.683 --> 23:40.947
Michael, this is Bob Kroiger.

23:41.019 --> 23:44.955
He's head of hotel security.
Bob, this is Michael Knight.

23:45.023 --> 23:49.255
Hi. We're trying to clear up a
few things regarding the estate.

23:49.327 --> 23:53.286
- You have any idea who this guy is?
- Yeah, that's Ed Williams.

23:54.199 --> 23:57.168
- Where you know him from?
- Here. The hotel.

23:57.235 --> 23:59.169
Your father brought him
into my office last week.

23:59.237 --> 24:01.296
Told me to hire him in Security,
so I did.

24:01.373 --> 24:04.206
The guy disappears on me
after one day. That's it, huh?

24:04.276 --> 24:05.971
That's all I know.

24:08.780 --> 24:10.771
Well, thank you, Bob.

24:11.883 --> 24:15.979
Well, if, uh,
you need anything, um...

24:24.496 --> 24:26.430
Ed Williams.
Yeah, I know.

24:26.498 --> 24:28.432
Same name they used
with the pilot.

24:28.500 --> 24:30.195
Mm-hmm.

24:30.268 --> 24:32.293
Why?
What were they trying to hide?

24:32.370 --> 24:37.205
Lauren, my guess is your father's investigation
turned up somebody or something here at the hotel,

24:37.275 --> 24:39.368
so he brought in this guy Olin
to work undercover.

24:39.444 --> 24:41.844
Then why would he suddenly
leave the next day?

24:41.913 --> 24:43.972
Maybe he found
what he was looking for.

24:44.049 --> 24:46.347
Your father keep any files,

24:46.418 --> 24:48.352
any letters, papers,
anything like that?

24:48.420 --> 24:50.445
We could look.
All right.

24:50.522 --> 24:52.717
You check the cabinets.
I'll check the desk.

24:52.791 --> 24:56.887
Maybe something will turn up
that's not locked away under Topaz.

25:05.504 --> 25:07.438
KITT, any progress
on the access code?

25:07.506 --> 25:12.409
As Bonnie pointed out, Michael, the possible
numerical combinations are virtually unlimited.

25:12.477 --> 25:16.709
Come on. Use your imagination.
How about 00001?

25:16.781 --> 25:20.217
- Thank you, Michael.
- Don't mention it, pal.

25:28.193 --> 25:30.184
All right.

25:48.346 --> 25:51.713
What?
I'm sorry.

25:51.783 --> 25:54.547
It's just that I feel so...

25:56.087 --> 25:58.282
Come on.
What is it?

26:00.258 --> 26:02.249
Today's my birthday.

26:03.828 --> 26:06.797
Dad always used to forget.

26:07.866 --> 26:10.426
This time he didn't forget.

26:24.316 --> 26:27.342
They're asking questions
about that detective, Olin.

26:27.419 --> 26:29.387
What'd you say?
Nothin'.

26:29.454 --> 26:33.322
That he came and he left. But
they're not gonna let it go at that.

26:33.391 --> 26:37.384
The next thing you know, they're gonna be trying
to get Topaz out of the old man's computer.

26:37.462 --> 26:39.453
They won't have any better luck
than we did.

26:39.531 --> 26:42.625
How do you know?
They're not here for their health.

26:42.701 --> 26:45.898
If they're on to something,
we could be in some bad trouble.

26:45.971 --> 26:51.034
Look, Royce is dead. Olin's dead.
You're not talking about...

26:51.109 --> 26:55.637
I'm talkin' whatever's necessary
to stay well paid and safe.

26:55.714 --> 26:58.444
As long as those files
are in that computer,

26:58.516 --> 27:01.314
and Royce's daughter
and her pal...

27:01.386 --> 27:04.116
are runnin' around
asking questions,

27:04.189 --> 27:06.521
I don't feel safe.

27:44.696 --> 27:47.460
Then at the blackjack table,
I was splitting a pair of tens...

27:47.532 --> 27:51.298
Nobody splits a pair of tens. Believe
it or not, I have never won before.

27:51.369 --> 27:53.303
You won!
I know.

27:56.608 --> 27:58.599
Oh, Michael.

28:00.879 --> 28:02.870
Now, don't tell me,
"You shouldn't have."

28:02.947 --> 28:04.938
You shouldn't have.

28:06.151 --> 28:08.711
Why not?
Because.

28:10.121 --> 28:12.612
Lauren, your father loved you.

28:13.692 --> 28:16.160
He wanted nothing
but the best for you.

28:17.162 --> 28:20.131
If he thought you let your birthday
slip by without a cake,

28:20.198 --> 28:23.167
or a smile
or a bottle of champagne...

28:25.070 --> 28:28.528
You're right. You hardly
know me, but you're right.

28:28.606 --> 28:31.200
How come you're
so right all the time?

28:31.276 --> 28:34.712
It's my specialty.

28:36.414 --> 28:38.746
Okay, there's the smile.

28:38.817 --> 28:41.251
Let's see. What else do
we have? Oh, the cake,

28:41.319 --> 28:43.253
champagne.

28:43.321 --> 28:46.552
Anything else?
I'll tell you what.

28:46.624 --> 28:49.058
You do the cake.

28:49.127 --> 28:51.118
I'll do the champagne.

28:52.864 --> 28:55.230
And then we'll see
what else comes to mind.

28:58.036 --> 29:00.027
Deal.

29:02.407 --> 29:04.398
Ready?

29:05.944 --> 29:07.935
Make a wish.

29:10.181 --> 29:12.172
Very good.

29:14.919 --> 29:16.853
Terrific.
Thank you.

29:16.921 --> 29:19.014
Champagne.

29:19.090 --> 29:21.115
A toast...

29:21.192 --> 29:23.422
to a man I hope
to get to know better.

29:28.500 --> 29:30.434
Um...

29:30.502 --> 29:32.493
Excuse me.
Yes.

29:37.208 --> 29:39.369
Bob.
Lauren, I'm sorry to interrupt,

29:39.444 --> 29:42.140
but Anne Tyler called
when you were out.

29:42.213 --> 29:45.614
She said that the police wanna see
you in L.A. First thing in the morning.

29:45.683 --> 29:48.049
- Did she say why?
- Something about a witness...

29:48.119 --> 29:50.679
to connect, uh, George Olin's death
to your father's.

30:10.308 --> 30:13.744
All right. Call me as soon
as you find out what they got.

30:13.812 --> 30:17.771
I will. And you call me if you
find out any more on George Olin.

30:17.849 --> 30:20.044
Yeah.
I'll miss you.

30:20.118 --> 30:23.645
Me too. Can I take a rain check
on the rest of the champagne?

30:25.990 --> 30:27.981
Rain check.

30:30.094 --> 30:32.085
Bye-bye.

30:34.465 --> 30:36.433
Don?
Don couldn't make it.

30:39.771 --> 30:43.537
Michael, my sensors are picking up
screams inside the plane.

30:59.591 --> 31:02.890
KITT, looks like I'm gonna need
a boarding pass.

31:03.928 --> 31:06.055
Does this mean
what I think it means?

31:06.130 --> 31:08.598
Yes. Take over, KITT.

31:10.768 --> 31:14.295
- This is highly unorthodox, Michael.
- Thanks for reminding me.

31:14.372 --> 31:17.205
Keep her steady, KITT.
All right.

31:17.275 --> 31:19.266
You got it.

31:25.016 --> 31:28.042
Be careful.

31:41.165 --> 31:43.895
What?
Shake him loose!

31:50.074 --> 31:53.009
Michael, what are you doing?
Gonna try to jam his rudder.

32:03.187 --> 32:05.747
Hang on, Michael.

32:11.262 --> 32:13.662
Michael?
Michael, are you all right?

32:27.211 --> 32:30.146
Michael?

32:30.214 --> 32:32.205
Can you hear me?

32:33.284 --> 32:35.275
Michael!

32:37.956 --> 32:41.357
- Devon?
- Hello.

32:41.426 --> 32:43.417
Welcome back.

32:44.495 --> 32:46.622
Where am I?

32:46.698 --> 32:49.428
What happened?
Whoa! Not so fast.

32:49.500 --> 32:51.525
You're in the semi
just outside Las Vegas.

32:51.602 --> 32:54.571
Fortunately, my friend, Dr. Carlysle,

32:54.639 --> 32:57.164
was on one of his
monthly gambling forays.

32:57.241 --> 32:59.175
I managed to corner him
at a crap table.

32:59.243 --> 33:04.408
My forays, as you call them,
are semiannual, not monthly.

33:04.482 --> 33:06.950
Now breathe.

33:07.018 --> 33:10.010
Deeper.

33:10.088 --> 33:12.386
- Where's Lauren?
- Michael, wait.

33:12.457 --> 33:14.584
- You should rest.
- What happened?

33:16.594 --> 33:19.529
- I'm afraid they got her.
- Who are "they"? Who?

33:19.597 --> 33:21.497
I was hoping you could tell me.

33:21.566 --> 33:25.024
Devon, the plane
was a company plane.

33:25.103 --> 33:27.037
Whoever planned this...

33:27.105 --> 33:30.597
was very clever and very thorough.

33:30.675 --> 33:36.045
They used a plane identical to Royce's.
They even filed a fictitious flight plan.

33:37.181 --> 33:39.149
Anything on Topaz?

33:39.217 --> 33:41.583
I've got KITT and every available
computer working around the clock.

33:41.652 --> 33:44.052
It's a long shot.
Michael, please sit down.

33:44.122 --> 33:46.784
Rampaging around like this
is not gonna accomplish anything.

33:46.858 --> 33:49.224
- The phone call.
- What?

33:49.293 --> 33:53.093
The police.
Do they have a new lead, a witness?

33:53.164 --> 33:55.155
Not as of an hour ago. Why?

33:56.300 --> 33:58.894
Michael, you're
in no condition to drive.

33:58.970 --> 34:01.734
Where the devil
do you think you're going?

34:01.806 --> 34:03.797
I gotta talk to Anne Tyler.

34:42.013 --> 34:45.176
You know, I just drove 20 miles
just to find a store,

34:46.417 --> 34:49.750
and then they had no steaks.

34:51.389 --> 34:53.949
What's happening to this country?

34:54.025 --> 34:56.391
I mean, how you gonna
keep a country strong...

34:56.460 --> 35:00.090
when the people are eatin' fish
and chicken all the time?

35:01.866 --> 35:03.857
Vegetables.

35:05.403 --> 35:09.032
Do you think you would ever
see a Russian eat a vegetable?

35:11.342 --> 35:13.333
You hungry?

35:16.681 --> 35:20.947
This means yes,
and this means no.

35:39.804 --> 35:42.739
Take this down to the art
department and check it, please.

35:42.807 --> 35:45.207
- I thought you were...
- Dead?

35:45.276 --> 35:48.211
Why would I think that?
I thought you were in Las Vegas.

35:48.279 --> 35:51.043
- Where's Lauren?
- That's what I came here to find out.

35:51.115 --> 35:53.549
I don't know what you mean.
Yes, you do!

35:53.618 --> 35:56.178
You called Bob Kroiger at the hotel
with a phony message...

35:56.254 --> 35:58.814
about the police needing Lauren
back here in L.A.

35:58.890 --> 36:03.088
I did not. I don't know what Bob told
you, but I haven't spoken to him in days.

36:03.161 --> 36:06.892
Good-bye, Mr. Knight.
Anne, listen to me!

36:06.964 --> 36:10.365
It's all coming apart at the seams.
It's not gonna work.

36:10.434 --> 36:14.063
I don't know exactly how
you're involved in this or why,

36:14.138 --> 36:16.129
but I know you're involved.

36:16.207 --> 36:20.337
Now, please, help me find Lauren
before they kill her too.

36:20.411 --> 36:22.879
Get your hands off me
before I call security!

36:22.947 --> 36:25.211
She trusted you.
Get out of here!

36:25.283 --> 36:27.911
I don't know what
Philip Royce did to you,

36:27.985 --> 36:30.647
real or imagined,
but to let Lauren die for his sins...

36:30.721 --> 36:33.246
puts you in a whole
different category, babe.

36:33.324 --> 36:36.293
And when your pals go down,
I swear to you...

36:36.360 --> 36:40.296
I'll make a point of seeing that
you go down right along with them,

36:40.364 --> 36:42.389
all the way.

36:43.568 --> 36:45.593
"Real or imagined"?

36:45.670 --> 36:47.900
You don't know the half of it.

36:47.972 --> 36:50.702
I was Philip's first centerfold.

36:50.775 --> 36:54.233
I worked day and night
to make Escape a success.

36:55.246 --> 36:57.180
I loved him.

36:57.248 --> 36:59.648
I gave him everything!

37:01.018 --> 37:04.112
Don't you see?
I helped create the great Philip Royce.

37:05.423 --> 37:08.654
But instead of marriage,
I got a lifetime contract...

37:08.726 --> 37:11.092
and a title.

37:11.162 --> 37:13.494
Instead of love, I...

37:13.564 --> 37:16.965
got a constant series of affairs.

37:17.034 --> 37:20.094
One woman after another,
year after year!

37:20.171 --> 37:24.335
Where are they keeping Lauren?
I don't know.

37:25.409 --> 37:27.877
I never thought
it would go this far.

37:27.945 --> 37:31.403
I'm telling you the truth!
I swear I don't know!

37:34.819 --> 37:37.845
Wait a minute.
That's you, isn't it?

37:37.922 --> 37:40.049
Your centerfold shot,
what month were you?

37:40.124 --> 37:42.217
Miss November. Why?

37:42.293 --> 37:45.319
The birthstone for November
is Topaz.

37:45.396 --> 37:47.387
He thought more of you
than you know.

38:09.220 --> 38:12.883
I'm gonna take off your gag, but before
I do, I'm gonna tell you something.

38:12.957 --> 38:15.517
I've been in
these situations before.

38:16.527 --> 38:20.019
People do crazy things.
You know what I mean?

38:20.097 --> 38:22.065
They start to yell and scream...

38:22.133 --> 38:24.124
and do dumb things.

38:25.136 --> 38:28.833
Now, take my advice.
Just relax and go with it.

38:28.906 --> 38:31.898
Whatever's gonna happen
is gonna happen.

38:35.946 --> 38:39.382
Just like I said,
as pretty as ever.

38:39.450 --> 38:42.419
- Hello, Lauren.
- Paul, Bob, what...

38:42.486 --> 38:45.046
I'm sorry.
This isn't what I intended.

38:45.122 --> 38:49.923
- None of this was ever supposed to happen.
- You're behind all of this?

38:49.994 --> 38:53.896
Paul, you murdered my father?
He was your friend!

38:53.964 --> 38:56.831
You too, Bob!
He trusted you! Why?

38:58.769 --> 39:02.261
This is insane. How could
you do that to him? Why?

39:02.340 --> 39:04.535
You know, I'm not proud
of what I had to do.

39:04.608 --> 39:06.701
I had to do it. Believe that.

39:06.777 --> 39:08.711
And let's not suffer under the...

39:09.914 --> 39:13.782
romantic delusion
that Philip Royce was a saint.

39:13.851 --> 39:16.581
He wasn't even a decent man,
for that matter.

39:16.654 --> 39:19.350
Hold her arm, please.
No.

39:19.423 --> 39:22.881
No!

39:22.960 --> 39:25.190
Topaz.

39:27.365 --> 39:29.560
Watch this.

39:32.069 --> 39:34.936
36-24-36.

39:36.941 --> 39:39.341
36-24-36?

39:40.344 --> 39:43.939
- Miss November.
- Miss November?

39:44.014 --> 39:47.279
- You've gotta be kidding.
- Look.

39:47.351 --> 39:49.546
"Accepted."

39:49.620 --> 39:51.918
- Who's the speed-reader?
- I am.

39:51.989 --> 39:54.651
Good. Find me a name. There's
gotta be a name in there.

39:56.026 --> 39:58.324
It has to do with drugs.
One drug in particular...

39:58.396 --> 40:00.455
Dialozine.
Passed by the F.D.A.

40:00.531 --> 40:04.092
But later, independent tests
show possible side effects.

40:04.168 --> 40:06.102
The company is
Parkway Pharmaceuticals.

40:06.170 --> 40:08.604
And the owner's name
is Paul DeBrett.

40:08.672 --> 40:11.232
Paul DeBrett.
Is that name familiar?

40:11.308 --> 40:14.573
Yes, he was on the guest list
at Philip Royce's that night.

40:14.645 --> 40:18.479
- A friend?
- It's hard to imagine a man in his position being directly involved.

40:18.549 --> 40:21.916
Unless his own life was at stake,
or that of his company's.

40:21.986 --> 40:26.923
Lauren, tell me about Topaz.
Topaz?

40:26.991 --> 40:31.087
Think of Topaz as a friend
who's trapped,

40:31.162 --> 40:33.858
a friend you want to set free.

40:35.699 --> 40:38.532
Do you know the access code?
No.

40:38.602 --> 40:40.832
Does your friend, Michael Knight?

40:40.905 --> 40:44.671
Michael. Michael.

40:44.742 --> 40:47.176
Does he?

40:47.244 --> 40:49.178
No.

40:52.016 --> 40:54.746
Michael, it's Devon.
Yeah, Devon?

40:54.819 --> 40:57.982
- Do you know the expression, "Do a 180"?
- Why? What's up?

40:58.055 --> 41:02.048
I made a few calls. Paul DeBrett
is not at his house in the city.

41:02.126 --> 41:05.459
He's at the house he's building in
the country. Eagle Lake, to be precise.

41:05.529 --> 41:08.430
All right. You heard the man,
KITT, let's go.

41:15.139 --> 41:18.302
She doesn't know. I told you
we didn't need to do this.

41:18.375 --> 41:21.833
- She doesn't know anything, neither does Knight.
- Don't fall apart on me.

41:21.912 --> 41:23.846
I just wanna
get this thing over with.

41:23.914 --> 41:26.007
I'm gonna get some air.

41:48.639 --> 41:52.268
She don't know nothin'.
Why don't we just dump her?

41:54.044 --> 41:55.978
You're right.
Let's go.

41:56.046 --> 41:59.209
And after, are we
coming back here or what?

41:59.283 --> 42:03.014
Why? Because I got 60 dollars'
worth of groceries in there.

42:03.087 --> 42:07.524
- You amaze me.
- It's him, the guy in the car! It's Knight!

42:07.591 --> 42:09.525
Here, hold this.

43:04.348 --> 43:06.111
Whoa!

43:10.554 --> 43:13.250
Let's get him, buddy!
Take over!

43:28.606 --> 43:31.939
I got her.
Let's get going! Let's go!

43:42.886 --> 43:44.877
Hop in, Michael.
I think we can catch them.

43:46.290 --> 43:48.281
Thanks, buddy.

45:17.381 --> 45:19.440
Hey, he's behind us!
Punch it!

45:54.218 --> 45:56.209
I beg your pardon.

45:57.855 --> 46:00.847
- Nice touch, Michael.
- Thanks, KITT.

46:05.796 --> 46:08.560
Take it easy.
Come on.

46:08.632 --> 46:10.862
It's okay.
I'm all right.

46:12.736 --> 46:14.761
Oop. You all right? Good.
What happened?

46:14.838 --> 46:17.398
Paul DeBrett, Bob! They...

46:17.474 --> 46:19.999
Whoop. There you go.

46:20.077 --> 46:22.102
It's okay. I got ya.

46:22.179 --> 46:24.613
It's all right.

46:24.681 --> 46:28.208
Michael, I got the point.
You're okay?

46:28.285 --> 46:30.879
I'm fine. Then what
am I holding you for?

46:32.122 --> 46:34.113
Are you all right?
I'm fine.

46:42.666 --> 46:44.759
The phone's been ringing
off the hook.

46:44.835 --> 46:48.498
The F.D.A.'s prohibited the sale of
Dialozine pending further investigation.

46:48.572 --> 46:51.632
Your father would've
been proud of you, your story.

46:51.708 --> 46:54.643
You're a worthy heir.
Well, thank you.

46:55.946 --> 47:00.508
And if I'm not mistaken, you and I have
some unfinished business to take care of.

47:00.584 --> 47:02.848
A rain check on
a half a bottle of champagne.

47:02.920 --> 47:05.582
Two-thirds of a bottle.

47:08.258 --> 47:10.192
Lauren, I love it!

47:10.260 --> 47:12.194
Yeah, I think it's one of
our best yet.

47:12.262 --> 47:14.287
Here, I'll give you
an expert opinion.

47:17.534 --> 47:20.332
Wow! Look at the lines
on that.

47:20.404 --> 47:22.770
Look at the curves.

47:22.840 --> 47:25.331
Well, KITT, what do you think?

47:27.311 --> 47:29.939
Overall, it's a very flattering layout.

47:30.013 --> 47:33.608
However, there is one small detail that
keeps it from being picture-perfect.

47:33.684 --> 47:36.209
No kidding.
What's that?

47:36.286 --> 47:38.516
Please remove the staple
from my fender.

48:00.277 --> 48:04.145
Michael Knight, a lone crusader
in a dangerous world,

48:04.214 --> 48:07.377
the world of the Knight Rider.
