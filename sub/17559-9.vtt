You, uh, you realize that's
your third grilled cheese?

00:12.470 --> 00:14.264
So what?
I'm stressed out.

00:14.347 --> 00:16.516
Well, that much cheese
is too much cholesterol.

00:16.599 --> 00:18.059
I mean, maybe you
should find a healthier way

00:18.143 --> 00:19.769
of dealing
with your stress.

00:26.025 --> 00:27.402
I was thinking more
of like a treadmill

00:27.485 --> 00:28.695
but whatever helps.

00:30.488 --> 00:32.281
Hey, I got your message.
Are you okay?

00:32.365 --> 00:34.284
No, last night, Henry asked me
flat-out if there's

00:34.367 --> 00:36.119
anything going on
between me and Vince.

00:36.202 --> 00:37.245
God. What'd you say?

00:37.328 --> 00:38.371
I didn't get a chance to answer.

00:38.455 --> 00:40.081
Thank God, Gary came over.

00:40.165 --> 00:43.793
Now, that's a sentence
you don't hear too often.

00:43.877 --> 00:45.253
[chuckles]
Well, here's one
you never hear.

00:45.336 --> 00:47.255
"Hey, Tina,
are you a supermodel?"

00:49.507 --> 00:51.968
So, if Gary hadn't come over,
what would you have done?

00:52.051 --> 00:54.637
Well, nothing is going on.

00:54.721 --> 00:56.473
Or accept that
you've got a boyfriend

00:56.556 --> 00:58.308
and you have feelings
for another guy.

01:02.562 --> 01:04.063
I don't know
what I'm going to do.

01:04.147 --> 01:05.815
Well, you don't have
to do anything right now.

01:05.899 --> 01:07.317
Henry's going to Princeton
this weekend

01:07.400 --> 01:09.194
so you can put it off
for a couple of days.

01:09.277 --> 01:12.238
Oh, no, no, no, she should
spend this weekend thinking

01:12.322 --> 01:14.157
about how she really feels.

01:14.240 --> 01:15.950
What are you, a chick?

Let me tell you
something, little one.

I am about to pick up my
girlfriend at the train station

01:22.832 --> 01:24.250
who has been in France
for six months.

01:24.334 --> 01:27.003
Now, that's six months of love
saved up for my baby.

Now, after she's been home
for a couple of hours

01:29.422 --> 01:32.133

how much of a chick I am?

09:43.207 --> 09:46.627
- I'm yelling over the party!
- You're at a party?

09:46.711 --> 09:50.589
Yes, and I'm having fun,
just like you told me to!

09:52.091 --> 09:54.510
- Good for you.
- What, why are you mad?

09:54.593 --> 09:56.262
- I'm not!
- You sound mad.

09:56.345 --> 09:58.180
I am! I gotta go! Bye!

10:01.934 --> 10:02.852
Oh, my God.

10:02.935 --> 10:04.603
"Do you pick irrational fights

10:04.687 --> 10:05.688
with your boyfriend?"

10:05.771 --> 10:08.524
You love him so much!

10:08.607 --> 10:10.401
Why does everyone
keep saying that?

10:10.484 --> 10:12.695
- Because it's true.
- I just screamed at him.

10:12.778 --> 10:14.655
He made me feel sick
to my stomach all day

10:14.739 --> 10:16.741
and he made me cry
in the middle of Penn Station!

10:16.824 --> 10:19.368
Aw, he made you cry?
Well, what did he do?

10:19.452 --> 10:20.661
He left!

10:26.125 --> 10:27.752
Oh, my God.

10:27.835 --> 10:30.171
Lauren, I think
you're right.

10:30.963 --> 10:32.423
I love Henry!

10:32.506 --> 10:34.383
Oh, I knew it!
I knew it!

10:36.802 --> 10:38.179
Guys suck!

10:39.472 --> 10:41.390
Cal calls me up
all sexy and everything

10:41.474 --> 10:42.767
and is like,
"I want to talk"

10:42.850 --> 10:45.227
so I race over there,
and check this out.

10:45.311 --> 10:46.687
He really wanted to talk.

10:49.106 --> 10:51.942
Gay.

10:52.026 --> 10:53.986
The next time Cal calls me
I am just going to tell him..

10:54.070 --> 10:55.905
- I love Henry!
- What?

10:55.988 --> 10:59.658
I love Henry, I mean,
the reason I've been so confused

10:59.742 --> 11:01.744
about my feelings for Henry
and my feelings for Vince

11:01.827 --> 11:04.163
is because I haven't
committed to Henry

11:04.246 --> 11:05.998
and now I can!

11:06.082 --> 11:07.249
I'm gonna call Henry
and tell him.

11:07.333 --> 11:09.251
Whoa, whoa, wait a minute.
This is huge.

11:09.335 --> 11:11.796
I mean, you know, once you
say it, it is out there.

11:11.879 --> 11:13.422
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

11:13.506 --> 11:15.091
So, all of a sudden,
your feelings for Vince

11:15.174 --> 11:16.258
just disappeared?

11:16.342 --> 11:18.094
Don't you see
what I was doing?

11:18.177 --> 11:20.221
I was so afraid
of committing to Henry

11:20.304 --> 11:22.723
that I invented
feelings for Vince.

11:22.807 --> 11:24.350
I mean,
Henry is considerate

11:24.433 --> 11:26.644
he's loyal,
he's always there for me..

11:26.727 --> 11:28.896
You just described
a friend.

11:28.979 --> 11:31.440
Which is something that
you are so not being right now.

11:31.524 --> 11:33.275
Otherwise, I think you'd be
a little more supportive.

11:33.359 --> 11:34.735
Now hand over the phone.

11:34.819 --> 11:37.613
I'm gonna call my boyfriend
and tell him that I love him.

11:37.697 --> 11:38.906
- No!
- See?

11:38.989 --> 11:40.491
What?

11:40.574 --> 11:43.160
You cannot profess
your love over the phone.

11:43.244 --> 11:45.704
In extreme circumstances,
sure, I've done it

11:45.788 --> 11:48.457
like if the guy's in
the Peace Corps or prison.

11:49.875 --> 11:50.918
I have to tell him tonight.

11:51.001 --> 11:52.294
I mean, he has been
waiting so long.

11:52.378 --> 11:53.754
He doesn't
care how I tell him.

11:53.838 --> 11:57.216
No, it'll be so much more
romantic in person.

11:57.299 --> 12:00.302
You're right.
I'm going right now.

12:00.386 --> 12:02.555
I'm gonna go to Princeton
to tell Henry that I love him.

12:02.638 --> 12:04.348
You don't even know
where he is.

12:04.432 --> 12:05.975
Yeah, I do.
He's at a party.

12:06.058 --> 12:08.727
- Which one?
- A Princeton one.

12:08.811 --> 12:10.020
Holly, are you insane?

12:10.104 --> 12:11.856
There's, like,
50 parties going on.

12:11.939 --> 12:13.983
It's a college campus
on a Saturday night.

12:14.066 --> 12:16.318
Yeah, Tina is right.

12:16.402 --> 12:19.655
I'm gonna have to borrow
something really cute from Val!

12:24.243 --> 12:26.120
[instrumental music]

12:31.375 --> 12:32.877
Why do you keep
avoiding me?

12:32.960 --> 12:35.629
I'm not avoiding you.
I just miss Chicago.

12:35.713 --> 12:39.008
'I wanted to see the view.'

12:39.091 --> 12:40.843
(Maureen)
'I know it makes
you uncomfortable'

12:40.926 --> 12:43.012
'but we really need to talk.'

12:43.095 --> 12:44.013
'Peter, the thing is..'

12:44.096 --> 12:46.640
[cell phone rings]

12:50.311 --> 12:51.228
Hello?

12:51.312 --> 12:53.063
Hey, it's me.
Were you asleep?

12:53.147 --> 12:54.190
No.

12:54.273 --> 12:55.858
Why are you whispering?

12:55.941 --> 12:57.193
You're not gonna believe this.

12:57.276 --> 13:00.029
Peter is in the room next to me.
He's with a girl.

13:00.112 --> 13:02.531
I'm trying to hear them.

13:02.615 --> 13:05.534
You don't have cable there?

13:05.618 --> 13:06.869
What do you want?

13:06.952 --> 13:08.621
I wanna go to Princeton.

13:08.704 --> 13:10.331
Oh, honey, that's great.

13:10.414 --> 13:13.250
But have you seen
your S.A.T scores?

13:14.960 --> 13:16.629
No, I wanna go tonight.

13:16.712 --> 13:18.631
I wanna go to see Henry
to tell him that I..

13:18.714 --> 13:20.132
Wait, wait, wait, shh.

13:20.216 --> 13:22.843
You know, with you in New York
and me here in Chicago

13:22.927 --> 13:24.386
it's been really
hard for me.

13:24.470 --> 13:28.390
I need more than three
or four reunions a year.

13:28.474 --> 13:29.892
Well, if you wanna go back in

13:29.975 --> 13:32.269
we could have three
or four reunions right now.

13:34.897 --> 13:37.775
Hmm.

13:37.858 --> 13:40.069
Okay, uh,
what were you saying?

13:40.152 --> 13:41.570
You're gonna go see Henry?

13:41.654 --> 13:43.989
Yeah, I wanna
tell him I love him.

13:44.073 --> 13:45.241
- What?
- Yeah.

13:45.324 --> 13:46.617
I finally figured it out.

13:46.700 --> 13:49.078
That's why I've been
so confused.

13:49.161 --> 13:50.871
You're breaking up with me?

13:50.955 --> 13:52.373
Oh, my God.

13:52.456 --> 13:53.791
I know. It's huge.

13:53.874 --> 13:55.084
I gotta go catch my train.

13:55.167 --> 13:56.293
But Lauren and Tina
are coming with me

13:56.377 --> 13:57.461
so don't worry.

13:57.545 --> 13:59.797
Can you believe it?
I love Henry.

13:59.880 --> 14:02.258
Okay, I love you too.
Bye.

14:02.341 --> 14:04.760
(Peter)
Well, I was gonna break up
with you, really.

14:04.843 --> 14:06.428
Because I'm not
ready for a commitment

14:06.512 --> 14:08.681
and I thought you were,
and I wasn't even gonna

14:08.764 --> 14:11.267
sleep with you
before I did it.

14:11.350 --> 14:14.645
(automated message)
'You've got mail.'

14:16.522 --> 14:17.856
Who's in here?

14:20.234 --> 14:22.820
[instrumental music]

14:32.830 --> 14:34.790
Hi, I'm Laurie.

14:34.873 --> 14:36.166
I'm a freshman.

14:36.250 --> 14:38.043
Somebody said
you have beer?

14:41.797 --> 14:43.132
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

14:43.215 --> 14:44.508
- Did you find him?
- No, I looked everywhere.

14:44.592 --> 14:45.801
I'm gonna try
calling him again.

14:45.884 --> 14:48.429
You know what this is?
This is a sign.

14:48.512 --> 14:50.472
This is a sign
that it's not meant to be.

14:50.556 --> 14:51.557
It's not a sign.

14:51.640 --> 14:54.518
Henry?
Hey, where are you?

14:54.602 --> 14:57.354
In your kitchen.

14:57.438 --> 14:58.689
What?
What are you doing there?

14:58.772 --> 15:01.984
Eating a doughnut hole.
Where are you?

15:02.067 --> 15:05.070
I'm in Princeton.
I wanted to see you.

15:05.154 --> 15:07.656
I wanted to see you too.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.575
I felt so bad about our fight.

15:09.658 --> 15:11.285
You went all the way
home to see me?

15:11.368 --> 15:14.580
You went all the way
to Princeton to see me?

15:14.663 --> 15:15.873
Aw..

15:15.956 --> 15:17.333
I'm sorry.

15:17.416 --> 15:20.085
I'm sorry too. Come back,
I'll wait for you here.

15:20.169 --> 15:22.087
Oh, I can't, I think
we missed the last train

15:22.171 --> 15:23.672
but I really, really
need to see you.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.341
Hey, if you come over
first thing in the morning.

15:25.424 --> 15:27.468
- I'll make you breakfast.
- I'll be there.

15:27.551 --> 15:29.303
- First thing?
- I promise.

15:29.386 --> 15:31.680
Aw, hey, by the way,
I think those doughnut holes

15:31.764 --> 15:32.890
are like three months old.

15:39.772 --> 15:42.358
[instrumental music]

15:49.907 --> 15:51.200
You okay?

15:51.283 --> 15:52.326
Not really.

15:52.409 --> 15:55.704
I did what you said.
I dumped Maureen.

15:57.790 --> 15:59.708
You are sickening.

15:59.792 --> 16:01.210
I heard the whole thing.

16:01.293 --> 16:02.461
I know your girlfriend
dumped you.

16:02.544 --> 16:04.004
Why can't you
just tell me that?

16:04.088 --> 16:05.881
Well, if I'd known
you were eavesdropping

16:05.964 --> 16:07.633
I would have!

16:07.716 --> 16:09.718
You know what?
You are an egomaniac.

16:09.802 --> 16:11.470
I'm sure you have
convinced yourself

16:11.553 --> 16:13.555
that you actually
did break up with her.

16:13.639 --> 16:15.641
Why can't you
just admit to yourself

16:15.724 --> 16:18.477
that there might be someone out
there who might not like you?

16:18.560 --> 16:20.437
Why can't you
just admit to yourself

16:20.521 --> 16:22.439
that you actually
like someone?

16:22.523 --> 16:23.732
Who do I like?

16:23.816 --> 16:25.526
Me.

16:25.609 --> 16:27.903
You? Ha ha!

16:27.986 --> 16:28.904
Oh!

16:28.987 --> 16:30.531
That is silly.

16:30.614 --> 16:33.992
Oh, oh, then why were you
eavesdropping on me all night?

16:34.076 --> 16:35.411
My balcony door was open.

16:35.494 --> 16:38.497
I can't control
what my ears hear.

16:38.580 --> 16:40.833
- You like me!
- I do not like you.

16:40.916 --> 16:42.751
- I bet you do.
- I bet I don't.

16:52.845 --> 16:55.597
So, who won the bet?

16:57.683 --> 17:00.269
Oh, I, uh,
I think you know.

17:02.855 --> 17:05.398
[instrumental music]

17:08.986 --> 17:11.530
[knocking on door]

17:13.531 --> 17:15.325
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:15.409 --> 17:16.617
I'm so glad to see you.

17:16.702 --> 17:18.746
I'm so glad to see you too.

17:18.829 --> 17:20.455
- Come here.
- Is everything okay?

17:20.539 --> 17:23.250
Everything's fantastic.
Sit.

17:23.333 --> 17:24.376
Hoo-ha !

17:27.755 --> 17:28.839
Okay.

17:28.922 --> 17:30.466
Henry.

17:30.549 --> 17:32.092
I am so happy.

17:32.176 --> 17:33.177
I am really happy too..

17:33.260 --> 17:34.678
Wait, don't talk.

17:34.762 --> 17:35.804
I've been thinking
about this

17:35.888 --> 17:37.723
and I want it
to come out perfect.

17:37.806 --> 17:39.933
Okay.

17:40.017 --> 17:43.061
Henry, I am so happy.

17:43.145 --> 17:45.773
And you are such
a big part of that.

17:45.856 --> 17:47.357
Ever since
we started going out--

17:47.441 --> 17:49.818
- 'Holly!'
- What?

17:49.902 --> 17:50.944
Jill she's going back
to France.

17:51.028 --> 17:52.321
She broke up with me.

17:52.404 --> 17:54.740
Oh, bummer, listen,
go home, write down everything

17:54.823 --> 17:56.950
that happened
and fax it to me.

17:57.034 --> 17:59.036
- Holly.
- Oh, um, sorry, Gary.

17:59.119 --> 18:01.330
I feel your pain but I really
need to talk to Henry

18:01.413 --> 18:02.498
alone right now.

18:02.581 --> 18:05.000
Uh, why don't you
go wait upstairs?

18:05.083 --> 18:07.503
Okay. Do you mind
if I grab a roll?

18:07.586 --> 18:09.671
No, no, go ahead.

18:09.755 --> 18:11.840
Oh, my damn.

18:11.924 --> 18:13.217
Croissants.

18:13.300 --> 18:14.343
France.

18:14.426 --> 18:16.386
Aw, Jill!

18:19.431 --> 18:21.225
I am so happy.

18:21.308 --> 18:23.018
Ever since
we started going out..

18:23.101 --> 18:24.686
- Holly?
- What?

18:24.770 --> 18:27.940
Why was Gary going into your
room, crying into a croissant?

18:29.525 --> 18:31.401
- Oh, Henry.
- Yes.

18:31.485 --> 18:33.695
- Okay, right, I'm going.
- Henry..

18:33.779 --> 18:36.740
Hey, was that
the last croissant?

18:36.824 --> 18:38.367
Oh, thanks. Oh!

18:43.455 --> 18:44.456
Okay, where was I?

18:44.540 --> 18:48.001
Um, Henry,
I am so happy.

18:48.085 --> 18:49.378
And I'm a really
big part of that.

18:49.461 --> 18:51.380
Right and, um,
ever since--

18:51.463 --> 18:53.298
- Holly?
- Oh, my God, what?

18:53.382 --> 18:54.508
What? I was just
coming over to..

18:54.591 --> 18:55.551
Oh, hey, Henry.

18:55.634 --> 18:57.386
Hey, uh, listen,
I gotta go.

18:57.469 --> 18:59.429
No, wait,
where are you going?

18:59.513 --> 19:01.682
To the bathroom.

19:01.765 --> 19:03.016
Okay, go ahead.

19:05.811 --> 19:06.937
Have you told him?

19:07.020 --> 19:09.022
No, everybody keeps
interrupting me.

19:09.106 --> 19:10.232
More signs.

19:10.315 --> 19:12.067
People interrupting me
is not a sign.

19:12.150 --> 19:13.902
Me not being able
to find Henry is not a sign.

19:13.986 --> 19:16.780
Me going to Princeton and Henry
coming here is not a sign.

19:16.864 --> 19:18.949
There are no signs.

19:19.032 --> 19:20.325
Hey.

19:20.409 --> 19:21.952
Hey.

19:22.035 --> 19:25.080
I, uh, I brought
something for you.

19:28.750 --> 19:30.460
Snaps?

19:30.544 --> 19:31.920
How did you..

19:32.004 --> 19:33.922
You, uh, you said,
you couldn't find them anywhere.

19:34.006 --> 19:36.091
And there's this old-time
candy shop in the village

19:36.174 --> 19:39.094
so I took a shot
and there they were.

19:41.096 --> 19:42.347
Wow.

19:44.516 --> 19:45.809
Thank you.

19:48.145 --> 19:49.396
You're welcome.

19:51.356 --> 19:53.275
Hey, dude,
how was, uh, Princeton?

19:53.358 --> 19:55.152
Short, but awesome.

19:55.235 --> 19:56.278
Uh, come on, Vince

19:56.361 --> 19:57.779
I'm gonna go on
down to the diner.

19:57.863 --> 20:00.991
You know, the one with
the big flashing neon sign?

20:02.409 --> 20:03.619
So, see you guys later?

20:06.872 --> 20:08.790
- What is that?
- Oh, oh..

20:08.874 --> 20:11.251
Just some candy
that I couldn't find.

20:13.921 --> 20:16.632
So, what did you
wanna tell me?

20:16.715 --> 20:19.927
Oh, oh, um, I just
wanted to tell you

20:20.010 --> 20:21.553
that I..

20:24.389 --> 20:26.600
I missed you.

20:26.683 --> 20:29.144
You, you went
all the way

20:29.227 --> 20:30.604
to Princeton
just to tell me

20:30.687 --> 20:31.980
you, you missed me?

20:32.064 --> 20:33.982
Yep, well,
I missed you a lot.

20:35.150 --> 20:37.486
I missed you too.

20:37.569 --> 20:38.654
Oh, Holly

20:38.737 --> 20:40.155
you are not going
to believe this.

20:40.238 --> 20:41.823
Remember how I told you
Peter was in the room

20:41.907 --> 20:42.908
next to me with some girl?

20:42.991 --> 20:44.368
She broke up with him..

20:46.161 --> 20:48.538
And then some
other stuff happened.

20:50.082 --> 20:51.375
Okay, I'm gonna
go upstairs and unpack.

20:51.458 --> 20:53.126
Wait, don't go,
I was just telling Henry

20:53.210 --> 20:55.379
that I missed him,
and that's all.

20:57.673 --> 20:59.508
Oh.

20:59.591 --> 21:01.969
Oh, it's gonna be okay, Gary.

21:02.052 --> 21:03.428
You'll move on.

21:03.512 --> 21:04.805
You know what they say.

21:04.888 --> 21:06.723
<i>C'est la vie.</i>

21:06.807 --> 21:08.558
French.

21:08.642 --> 21:09.768
Jill.

21:09.851 --> 21:11.895
My Jill!
