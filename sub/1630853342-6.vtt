00:25.416 --> 00:27.723
Previously on
Star Trek: Strange New Worlds...

00:27.766 --> 00:29.203
SPOCK:
You saw the future?

00:29.246 --> 00:30.856
PIKE:
I know exactly how and when

00:30.900 --> 00:33.163
my life ends.
And I didn't just see it,

00:33.207 --> 00:35.426
I felt it,
every agonizing second.

00:35.470 --> 00:36.993
Don't throw
your life away, Chris.

00:37.037 --> 00:38.168
I made a choice.

00:38.212 --> 00:39.735
I accepted my fate.

00:39.778 --> 00:41.302
What if you're wrong?

00:41.345 --> 00:44.174
What if your fate
is what you make it?

00:44.218 --> 00:46.263
-I hear you speak 12 languages.
-37.

00:46.307 --> 00:48.961
I found early that,
if I wanted to be understood,

00:49.005 --> 00:50.702
it's best to communicate
in someone's own tongue.

00:50.746 --> 00:52.443
So, I learned them.

00:52.487 --> 00:53.836
HEMMER:
Doctor, I need to check

00:53.879 --> 00:55.446
your emergency
medical transporter

00:55.490 --> 00:58.101
for systems integration
and excess power usage.

00:58.145 --> 01:00.060
Please stop
messing around in here!

01:00.103 --> 01:01.365
Hemmer's diagnostic

01:01.409 --> 01:02.758
shows you're keeping something

01:02.801 --> 01:04.803
in the pattern buffer.

01:04.847 --> 01:07.980
-Rukiya, my daughter.
-Hi, Dad.

01:08.024 --> 01:10.026
M'BENGA:
You can't imagine what it's like

01:10.070 --> 01:11.201
to watch your child
wither away.

01:11.245 --> 01:12.724
And somewhere

01:12.768 --> 01:15.118
is a planet that has
the discovery I need.

01:19.905 --> 01:23.170
PIKE:
Captain's log, stardate 1943.7.

01:23.213 --> 01:25.215
We have arrived
at the Majalan system,

01:25.259 --> 01:28.305
a minor star cluster at the edge
of Federation space.

01:28.349 --> 01:30.699
I was last here ten years ago,

01:30.742 --> 01:32.222
on a rescue mission.

01:32.266 --> 01:34.094
When a pulsar nearly kills you,

01:34.137 --> 01:36.226
you tend not to forget.

01:36.270 --> 01:39.316
Our mission today is
a routine cartographic survey.

01:40.578 --> 01:42.972
I expect it will be
a lot quieter.

01:43.015 --> 01:45.017
-Captain.
-Cadet Uhura.

01:48.325 --> 01:49.587
You all right?

01:49.631 --> 01:52.677
Oh, it's... nothing.

01:52.721 --> 01:54.810
Just a little sore
after combat training.

01:54.853 --> 01:56.768
Ah, right. You're on rotation

01:56.812 --> 01:58.205
with Lieutenant Noonien-Singh
this week.

01:58.248 --> 02:01.599
Lesson one of security?

02:01.643 --> 02:03.601
"A Rigelian tiger

02:03.645 --> 02:05.603
pounces with no warning."

02:05.647 --> 02:08.563
Yeah. [laughs]
I learned that one, all right.

02:08.606 --> 02:12.175
Well, I've come to understand
La'An has a lot to teach.

02:12.219 --> 02:14.525
Although...

02:14.569 --> 02:16.353
keep your eye out
for lesson seven.

02:16.397 --> 02:17.963
What's lesson seven?

02:18.007 --> 02:19.878
[door whooshes open]

02:23.752 --> 02:26.494
[boatswain's whistle blows]

02:26.537 --> 02:28.365
Nice of you to join us, Cadet.

02:28.409 --> 02:30.672
Did you find your break restful?

02:30.715 --> 02:32.761
Super restful,
thanks for asking.

02:32.804 --> 02:34.893
Lesson two of security...

02:34.937 --> 02:36.852
"There are no breaks in security

02:36.895 --> 02:39.724
because threats
never take breaks."

02:39.768 --> 02:42.162
UNA:
Captain, we're receiving
a distress call

02:42.205 --> 02:43.815
from a non-Federation shuttle.

02:43.859 --> 02:44.860
They say they're under attack.

02:44.903 --> 02:46.775
From who?

02:46.818 --> 02:48.777
Scans indicate
a small combat cruiser.

02:48.820 --> 02:51.432
Light armaments.
Non-Federation ID.

02:51.475 --> 02:53.521
Shields up
and take us closer, Erica.

03:12.322 --> 03:14.411
Ensign Shankar,
hail that cruiser.

03:14.455 --> 03:16.326
No response, sir.

03:16.370 --> 03:17.936
PIKE:
Then get me an open channel.

03:17.980 --> 03:20.243
This is Christopher Pike
of the USS Enterprise.

03:20.287 --> 03:22.027
You are committing
an act of aggression.

03:22.071 --> 03:24.682
As the other vessel
has appealed to us for help,

03:24.726 --> 03:26.380
I am obliged
by both Federation law

03:26.423 --> 03:27.642
and my own conscience
to intervene.

03:27.685 --> 03:28.730
I order you to stand down.

03:33.082 --> 03:34.910
Damage?

03:34.953 --> 03:38.305
Negligible. Shield integrity
is only down .02%.

03:39.436 --> 03:41.612
Red alert and evasive maneuvers.

03:41.656 --> 03:42.918
Aye, Captain.

03:42.961 --> 03:45.137
Captain, they...
appear to be making

03:45.181 --> 03:46.661
an attack run at us.

03:46.704 --> 03:48.315
It's the little dog
with the most to prove.

03:48.358 --> 03:49.403
Sir?

03:49.446 --> 03:50.882
It's an expression.

03:50.926 --> 03:52.275
You think you can
take out their weapons

03:52.319 --> 03:53.668
without blowing them
to smithereens?

03:53.711 --> 03:55.496
Charge phasers.

03:55.539 --> 03:57.628
-Minimum capacity.
-Charging.

03:57.672 --> 04:00.022
-They're locking phasers
again, Captain.
-Fire.

04:05.636 --> 04:07.551
UHURA:
Apologies.

04:07.595 --> 04:09.336
Captain, I was trying
to graze them,

04:09.379 --> 04:11.512
but they fired and changed
course right into our weapons.

04:11.555 --> 04:13.122
I think they got the hint.

04:15.864 --> 04:17.996
Firing three times
on a Starfleet ship.

04:18.040 --> 04:20.216
If it wasn't our business
before, it is now.

04:20.260 --> 04:23.393
Sir, shuttle is hailing us,
requesting immediate evacuation.

04:23.437 --> 04:25.090
Their life support systems
are failing.

04:25.134 --> 04:26.440
Prepare to beam them aboard.

04:26.483 --> 04:28.006
Let's go meet our guests.

Alora?

04:52.509 --> 04:54.772
You know her, Captain?

04:56.383 --> 04:57.775
Or should I call you Lieutenant?

05:08.569 --> 05:10.135
PIKE:
Space.

05:11.485 --> 05:13.487
The final frontier.

These are the voyages
of the starshipEnterprise.

05:30.852 --> 05:34.421
and new civilizations,

He rescued me
from another shuttle.

07:01.159 --> 07:03.161
Seems like you have
bad luck with shuttles.

07:03.205 --> 07:04.989
Or good,

depending on how you look at it.

Well, allow me to welcome
you all to Enterprise.

Your, uh,

Oh, it's gold, technically,

07:23.181 --> 07:25.096
I'm a captain. So...

07:25.140 --> 07:28.230
Well, on behalf of Majalis,
we thank you for your help...

07:29.449 --> 07:30.580
...Captain Pike.

07:30.624 --> 07:34.018
Uh, this is my Number One.

Una... Uh, Lieu-Lieutenant
Commander Una Chin-Riley.

07:39.850 --> 07:42.549
Allow me to take you
to the ready room to debrief.

07:42.592 --> 07:44.638
But first, I must insist

07:44.681 --> 07:46.030
you take us
to your medical facility.

07:46.074 --> 07:47.423
Of course, right away.

07:47.467 --> 07:48.772
Uh, Chief Kyle
will escort you down.

07:48.816 --> 07:50.687
Uh, sorry, are you

07:50.731 --> 07:52.297
Strictly in a biological sense.

You just read me the same exact
chapter twice in a row.

I did?

08:13.014 --> 08:14.755
Darling...

08:16.539 --> 08:17.932
...you know how I've been
keeping your pattern

08:17.975 --> 08:19.411
in the transporter buffer,

08:19.455 --> 08:21.501
so you don't keep
getting sicker?

08:21.544 --> 08:24.155
-Yes.
-Well...

08:24.199 --> 08:27.550
I can't keep you
out of there for very long,

08:27.594 --> 08:30.814
and sometimes it's hard
to keep track of the details.

08:30.858 --> 08:34.339
Sometimes, you put me back in
when I don't notice?

08:34.383 --> 08:37.125
So, how long have you
really been reading to me?

08:38.430 --> 08:39.867
A while.

08:39.910 --> 08:43.087
I've put the transport system
on a timer,

08:43.131 --> 08:44.741
so as to not be disruptive.

08:44.785 --> 08:47.396
When will it...

08:54.446 --> 08:55.970
-[door chimes]
-Come.

08:57.972 --> 08:59.582
Doctor.

08:59.626 --> 09:01.279
We've got people coming in
with possible injuries.

09:08.156 --> 09:11.289
ALORA:
First Servant
is a very special child.

09:11.333 --> 09:13.814
A holy figure.

09:13.857 --> 09:15.946
Chosen at birth by lottery

09:15.990 --> 09:18.688
to embody our maxim:

09:18.732 --> 09:22.039
science, service, sacrifice.

09:22.083 --> 09:23.824
He's forsworn his own family

09:23.867 --> 09:27.001
because everyone on Majalis
is his family.

09:32.528 --> 09:34.486
Okay.

09:34.530 --> 09:37.359
Um, what were you doing
on that moon?

09:37.402 --> 09:39.274
On that moon
is an ancient retreat

09:39.317 --> 09:41.581
for the First Servant's studies.

09:41.624 --> 09:44.627
Elder Gamal and I were
returning him to Majalis

09:44.671 --> 09:46.411
when the ship attacked us

09:46.455 --> 09:48.588
and demanded
we surrender the child.

09:48.631 --> 09:50.633
And you have no idea
who they were?

09:50.677 --> 09:54.071
The closest inhabitable planet
is occupied by

09:54.115 --> 09:56.770
descendants of a long-abandoned
alien colony.

09:56.813 --> 09:58.989
Still, our two worlds
have coexisted

09:59.033 --> 10:00.817
peacefully for centuries.

10:04.691 --> 10:07.563
I believe it is possible
they were after a ransom.

10:08.825 --> 10:10.566
In two days,
I will be overseeing

10:10.610 --> 10:12.046
the First Servant's ascension

10:12.089 --> 10:13.569
to the throne.

10:13.613 --> 10:16.180
It's a sacred ceremony.

10:16.224 --> 10:20.141
If outsiders knew about that,

10:20.184 --> 10:23.405
they would also know
Majalis would pay anything

10:23.448 --> 10:24.754
for the child's safe return.

10:24.798 --> 10:26.321
LA'AN:
We should send a landing party

10:26.364 --> 10:28.192
to investigate the crashed ship.

10:28.236 --> 10:31.195
There is a chance, however
slight, your attackers survived.

10:31.239 --> 10:33.284
An investigation
won't be necessary.

10:33.328 --> 10:35.896
All I ask is you return us
peacefully to Majalis.

10:35.939 --> 10:39.726
An investigation is not only
necessary, it is required.

10:41.902 --> 10:44.382
Captain Pike.

10:44.426 --> 10:48.038
My people didn't
join the Federation.

10:48.082 --> 10:50.780
We've always handled things
for ourselves.

10:50.824 --> 10:54.001
Please, let us handle this.

10:54.044 --> 10:57.265
Starfleet regulations
requires us to investigate

10:57.308 --> 10:59.615
any vessel that attacks us,

10:59.659 --> 11:01.965
with or without your
cooperation, I'm afraid.

11:02.009 --> 11:02.966
I'm sorry.

11:03.010 --> 11:05.621
If you insist,

11:05.665 --> 11:08.189
I'm coming, too.

11:08.232 --> 11:11.105
With or without
your cooperation.

11:23.987 --> 11:27.904
It's showing a slight reduction
in cerebral blood flow.

11:27.948 --> 11:31.386
Consistent with head trauma.

11:31.429 --> 11:34.258
Next time the hull falls on you,

11:34.302 --> 11:36.217
try not to block it
with your head.

11:36.260 --> 11:38.045
-[chuckles]
-[chuckles] Deal.

11:39.481 --> 11:40.830
Do you have anything to eat?

11:40.874 --> 11:42.571
Does this look like a mess hall?

11:45.400 --> 11:47.228
Ah. Please keep
that butcher's knife

11:47.271 --> 11:48.795
away from the First Servant.

11:48.838 --> 11:51.319
-It's a subdermal scalpel.
-I know what it is.

11:51.362 --> 11:53.364
All I needed was for you
to scan him, that's all.

11:53.408 --> 11:55.236
May I?

11:56.411 --> 11:58.152
It's okay, Nurse.

12:00.937 --> 12:02.765
Have at it.

12:10.642 --> 12:13.384
There.
Just wanted to check that

12:13.428 --> 12:15.560
his quantum-bio implants
are functioning.

12:15.604 --> 12:17.301
Thank you.

12:17.345 --> 12:18.868
He has quantum-bio implants?

12:18.912 --> 12:20.914
They didn't show up on my scan.

12:20.957 --> 12:22.567
GAMAL:
That's not surprising,
considering

12:22.611 --> 12:23.655
the state of this abattoir.

12:23.699 --> 12:24.700
This is a state-of-the-art

12:24.744 --> 12:25.745
medical facility.

12:25.788 --> 12:26.789
GAMAL:
Maybe to you.

12:26.833 --> 12:28.008
In my clinic, healing begins

12:28.051 --> 12:29.574
at a subatomic level.

12:29.618 --> 12:31.011
FIRST SERVANT:
It's true. My implants rebuild

12:31.054 --> 12:33.317
biological functions
using quantum mechanics.

12:34.666 --> 12:35.929
What is that?

12:37.321 --> 12:40.237
Back up. You're a doctor.

12:40.281 --> 12:41.978
I was,

12:42.022 --> 12:44.111
until I became the father
of the First Servant.

12:44.154 --> 12:46.635
-Now he's my only patient.
-This scanner is

12:46.678 --> 12:48.332
rudimentary,

12:48.376 --> 12:50.770
but still pretty interesting.

12:58.865 --> 13:00.649
-He's improving.
-GAMAL: I'd still like

13:00.692 --> 13:03.304
to keep him here
for observation.

13:03.347 --> 13:05.393
So, in theory,

13:05.436 --> 13:08.135
your implants
might re-align peptide bonds

13:08.178 --> 13:10.659
within any degraded protein?

13:10.702 --> 13:12.182
At the bare minimum.

13:12.226 --> 13:14.271
M'BENGA:
If this is true, disease

13:14.315 --> 13:16.099
and suffering would be
things of the past.

13:17.361 --> 13:19.799
On Majalis, we have a saying.

13:19.842 --> 13:22.497
"Let the tree that grows
from the roots of sacrifice

13:22.540 --> 13:24.804
lift us where suffering
cannot reach."

13:26.806 --> 13:29.025
We have no disease of any kind.

13:58.228 --> 13:59.795
Life signs?

14:01.841 --> 14:03.799
No readings.

14:03.843 --> 14:06.019
Nothing's in here.

14:10.719 --> 14:12.329
LA'AN:
Let's sweep the area.

14:12.373 --> 14:15.071
Be alert for any surprises
they left behind.

14:24.951 --> 14:26.778
Congratulations.
You just flunked

14:26.822 --> 14:29.172
lesson three of security.

14:29.216 --> 14:31.914
"Let your tricorder
do the investigating."

14:31.958 --> 14:33.829
Some Klingon ships are equipped

14:33.873 --> 14:36.005
with a scuttle system,
even the lightest touch

14:36.049 --> 14:38.094
could trigger
an auto-destruct sequence.

14:43.143 --> 14:46.407
I don't think we're in
any danger of blowing up.

14:46.450 --> 14:48.104
They wiped their data banks.

14:48.148 --> 14:49.976
Luck runs out fast, Cadet.

14:50.019 --> 14:51.542
Next time, be more careful.

14:51.586 --> 14:55.024
Crash site is secure,
Lieutenant Spock.

14:59.028 --> 15:00.812
Looks like they beamed out.

15:03.206 --> 15:04.555
The technology here
is consistent

15:04.599 --> 15:06.427
with the colony
I told you about.

15:22.834 --> 15:26.534
This does not appear to be
a part of the ship's functions.

15:26.577 --> 15:28.014
Do you recognize it?

15:28.057 --> 15:29.885
No.

15:40.591 --> 15:42.724
But I recognize this.

15:44.856 --> 15:45.988
PIKE:
What am I looking at?

15:46.032 --> 15:48.382
An oath coin.

15:48.425 --> 15:49.949
Linnarean Guards
are given one when they swear

15:49.992 --> 15:51.994
to protect the life
of the First Servant.

15:52.038 --> 15:54.214
It's the highest
of our military honors.

15:55.519 --> 15:56.781
Look.

15:58.348 --> 16:00.829
To deface a sacred symbol,

16:00.872 --> 16:02.918
it's forbidden.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.485
I have to entertain
the possibility

16:04.528 --> 16:06.052
that one of our guards
has betrayed his oath

16:06.095 --> 16:07.705
and joined forces with the alien

16:07.749 --> 16:10.273
colonists in trying to kidnap
the First Servant.

16:13.755 --> 16:16.932
The boy is in great danger.

16:16.976 --> 16:18.803
Frankly, so am I.

16:18.847 --> 16:20.457
You can all stay
on the Enterprise

16:20.501 --> 16:21.676
for as long as you need.

16:21.719 --> 16:23.417
I have duties on Majalis.

16:23.460 --> 16:25.810
Peaceful transition of power,

16:25.854 --> 16:27.638
it's the cornerstone
of our society.

16:27.682 --> 16:30.815
Any disruption now
would create widespread panic.

16:30.859 --> 16:32.774
Then I'll send you
with armed escorts.

16:32.817 --> 16:34.645
We're a private people.

16:36.212 --> 16:38.562
Foreign representatives
aren't welcome.

16:43.002 --> 16:45.613
What about a friend?

16:45.656 --> 16:47.789
You can have friends, right?

17:18.037 --> 17:20.778
After your speech
at the opening ceremony,

17:20.822 --> 17:23.651
you have the tree-planting
at the sky garden,

17:23.694 --> 17:26.349
and then you have
the Festival of Gratitude

17:26.393 --> 17:27.829
all evening.

17:27.872 --> 17:29.091
That's quite a schedule.

17:29.135 --> 17:32.051
See why I couldn't stay away?

17:32.094 --> 17:33.878
I need to add something
to the agenda.

17:33.922 --> 17:35.663
Please bring in the guards.

17:39.797 --> 17:42.017
Ready to shake the tree
and see what falls out?

17:42.061 --> 17:44.106
Am I.

17:44.150 --> 17:45.934
Here we go.

17:54.421 --> 17:56.379
Elder Gamal,

17:56.423 --> 17:58.729
a word in private?

18:10.524 --> 18:12.047
Do you recognize this?

18:13.875 --> 18:16.530
No.

18:16.573 --> 18:19.968
My analysis indicates it is
a kind of neural dampener,

18:20.011 --> 18:22.666
designed to reduce the brain's
electrical activity.

18:22.710 --> 18:25.843
We found it in the wreckage
of the ship.

18:25.887 --> 18:28.411
GAMAL:
As I said, I've never seen this.

18:28.455 --> 18:29.978
SPOCK:
Based on its size,

18:30.021 --> 18:31.762
logic suggests your attackers
may have intended

18:31.806 --> 18:33.329
to use it on the boy.

18:33.373 --> 18:36.289
Can I see it?

18:36.332 --> 18:37.812
I'd rather you didn't.

18:41.511 --> 18:44.253
You must be the science officer.

18:44.297 --> 18:47.387
-I am.
-Do you know the speed
of propagation of subspace

18:47.430 --> 18:49.998
radio signals
in long-range communications?

18:54.655 --> 18:57.092
I believe it is roughly
52,000 times

18:57.136 --> 18:59.790
-the speed of light.
-Really?

18:59.834 --> 19:02.619
Wow, that's... super slow.

19:02.663 --> 19:04.621
No wonder you have to use
subspace relays.

19:04.665 --> 19:06.754
At those distances,
the signals would degrade

19:06.797 --> 19:08.190
long before they were received,

19:08.234 --> 19:10.061
even when radially polarized.

19:10.105 --> 19:13.326
I do not know many your age
who grasp radial polarization.

19:13.369 --> 19:15.154
I'm interested in it because

19:15.197 --> 19:18.200
I thought it would be fun to
have a friend across the galaxy.

19:18.244 --> 19:20.463
I once worked on my own
subspace frequency.

19:20.507 --> 19:23.901
I bet I could generate one
by rewiring this biobed.

19:23.945 --> 19:25.903
That would be
an impressive feat,

19:25.947 --> 19:28.079
though Dr. M'Benga might object.

19:31.300 --> 19:32.693
Pardon me, Mr. Spock.

19:33.955 --> 19:35.304
The boy needs his rest.

19:35.348 --> 19:37.785
He has a big day tomorrow.

19:37.828 --> 19:39.743
If you don't mind.

19:39.787 --> 19:41.745
ALORA:
It is the eve of
the First Servant's

19:41.789 --> 19:44.270
ascension to the throne.

19:44.313 --> 19:46.228
In our most sacred time,

19:46.272 --> 19:47.795
it is important
to remind ourselves

19:47.838 --> 19:49.536
of the sanctity of our calling,

19:49.579 --> 19:52.408
so I ask that
you renew your vows.

19:53.844 --> 19:55.803
Present your coins.

20:00.764 --> 20:03.854
Will you uphold
your covenant to Majalis

20:03.898 --> 20:06.770
and faithfully defend the life

20:06.814 --> 20:08.207
of the First Servant?

20:08.250 --> 20:10.731
You hold your oath,

20:10.774 --> 20:12.646
your bond,

20:12.689 --> 20:14.865
in your hand.

20:18.086 --> 20:20.175
Kier, the case is damaged.

20:20.219 --> 20:22.786
Your coin-- what happened?

20:22.830 --> 20:25.963
It's nothing. An accident.

20:28.444 --> 20:30.359
May I take a closer look?

20:59.606 --> 21:01.825
No.

21:01.869 --> 21:04.306
This way.

21:06.134 --> 21:07.831
FEMALE GUARD:
Spread out!

21:10.530 --> 21:11.618
[grunts]

21:14.534 --> 21:16.231
[shouts]

21:16.275 --> 21:18.059
[grunting]

21:30.419 --> 21:32.291
[grunts]

21:37.818 --> 21:39.341
It's not on stun.

21:41.648 --> 21:43.476
Kier,

21:43.519 --> 21:45.304
we just want to talk.

21:47.697 --> 21:49.308
Good.

21:49.351 --> 21:51.919
Now, tell me,

21:51.962 --> 21:54.313
why were you on that ship?

21:54.356 --> 21:56.402
To fulfill my oath,

21:56.445 --> 21:59.405
and to renounce everything
this floating hell stands for.

22:01.581 --> 22:03.626
Long live the First Servant.

22:03.670 --> 22:06.455
[grunting]

22:08.414 --> 22:10.459
[both panting]

22:13.070 --> 22:14.115
[shouts]

22:20.643 --> 22:22.689
Careful, Cadet.
Remember to chew.

22:24.038 --> 22:26.954
Oh, right, you're on rotation
with Lieutenant Noonien-Singh.

22:26.997 --> 22:29.304
Word gets around.

22:29.348 --> 22:31.567
Tell her from me,
you deserve a full hour.

22:31.611 --> 22:33.003
You can tell me yourself,
Lieutenant.

22:34.265 --> 22:35.571
I would, but

22:35.615 --> 22:38.705
I'm, uh, conflict-averse.

22:38.748 --> 22:39.793
[Uhura chuckles]

22:42.752 --> 22:44.667
LA'AN:
Take a look at these data chips.

22:46.103 --> 22:47.322
Are these from the crash site?

22:47.366 --> 22:49.716
I may have liberated them.

22:49.759 --> 22:52.414
But isn't taking them without
permission against protocol?

22:52.458 --> 22:55.025
Lesson six of security:

22:55.069 --> 22:56.679
"Know when to bend the rules."

22:56.723 --> 22:58.289
You're right.

22:58.333 --> 23:00.291
Starfleet wouldn't approve
of how I acquired these,

23:00.335 --> 23:03.469
so I can't put them
through the ship's translator.

23:03.512 --> 23:05.514
Fortunately for me,
I don't have to.

23:05.558 --> 23:08.299
Following proper procedure
would take weeks.

23:09.823 --> 23:12.391
You want me to translate
all of these?

23:12.434 --> 23:13.827
Well, you're a linguist,
aren't you?

23:22.488 --> 23:26.143
I see no signs there was
ever any head trauma.

23:26.187 --> 23:29.973
To reconstitute the molecular
structure of damaged tissue...

23:31.714 --> 23:33.455
[short exhale]

23:33.499 --> 23:36.806
It's revolutionary.

23:36.850 --> 23:38.939
May I ask a hypothetical,

23:38.982 --> 23:40.854
doctor to doctor?

23:40.897 --> 23:43.639
No one's stopping you.

23:43.683 --> 23:46.512
Say I had a patient
with mast cell cygnokemia.

23:46.555 --> 23:49.210
11-year-old female.

23:49.253 --> 23:51.212
Could quantum-bio implants

23:51.255 --> 23:54.998
reverse cellular degranulation,
even in late stages?

23:55.042 --> 23:57.000
On Majalis,
it could be reversed.

23:57.044 --> 24:00.743
And if I ever had
such a patient,

24:00.787 --> 24:02.745
could I send them your way?

24:02.789 --> 24:05.052
I'm afraid not.

24:05.095 --> 24:06.880
It is illegal
to share our technologies

24:06.923 --> 24:09.360
with unaffiliated races.

24:09.404 --> 24:11.058
The Federation
has similar policies.

24:11.101 --> 24:13.887
Not when it comes
to medical interventions.

24:15.236 --> 24:16.846
Perhaps, one day,

24:16.890 --> 24:18.805
an alliance between our worlds
could serve us all.

24:28.684 --> 24:30.860
Sure you don't want to get
checked out by a doctor?

24:30.904 --> 24:32.514
I'm okay, Chris, really.

24:33.689 --> 24:36.213
I just...

24:36.257 --> 24:38.999
I knew him. Kier.

24:39.042 --> 24:41.610
-For years.
-He would've killed you.

24:43.046 --> 24:45.353
-He almost did.
-That's exactly it.

24:45.396 --> 24:47.094
I mean, what if there are others

24:47.137 --> 24:48.922
who feel the same way he did?

24:48.965 --> 24:50.793
That I thought I knew.

24:53.013 --> 24:54.710
I feel like there's
no one I can trust.

24:54.754 --> 24:56.799
I'm gonna put a guard out here,

24:56.843 --> 24:58.888
just to be safe.

24:58.932 --> 25:00.542
You don't have to do that.

25:01.891 --> 25:04.503
I didn't save you from a pulsar
just to let you get killed.

25:08.594 --> 25:11.292
I meant...

25:11.335 --> 25:13.990
you could come in
with me instead.

25:39.450 --> 25:41.496
[Pike and Alora laughing]

25:50.723 --> 25:53.247
PIKE:
I have a confession to make.

25:53.290 --> 25:56.206
That first time we met...

25:56.250 --> 25:58.731
I may have been hitting on you,

25:58.774 --> 26:01.603
-just a little.
-[chuckles]

26:01.647 --> 26:03.997
Oh, you definitely were.

26:04.040 --> 26:05.825
[laughs]

26:09.480 --> 26:12.266
Got to admit...

26:12.309 --> 26:14.485
it's pretty crazy we met again.

26:16.618 --> 26:18.794
It does seem unlikely.

26:21.928 --> 26:24.495
I did think about you
every now and then.

26:24.539 --> 26:26.802
Yeah, me too.

26:28.543 --> 26:31.807
I thought...

26:31.851 --> 26:33.983
"I wonder what ever happened
to that Majalan girl

26:34.027 --> 26:35.419
who couldn't fly a shuttle."

26:35.463 --> 26:39.119
-[laughs]
-Stop it.

26:39.162 --> 26:41.512
I knew how to fly it.

26:41.556 --> 26:44.472
Yeah. I just flew it
into the wrong place.

26:44.515 --> 26:45.778
[laughs]

26:49.042 --> 26:52.262
I don't know, I felt like...

26:52.306 --> 26:54.743
we recognized something
in each other.

26:56.223 --> 26:59.356
It was a shame that we never got
to follow through with that.

26:59.400 --> 27:01.532
Was I wrong?

27:01.576 --> 27:03.622
I mean, I wasn't expecting this.

27:03.665 --> 27:06.102
Mm.

27:06.146 --> 27:09.018
But it's rare to know
what's in your future.

27:09.062 --> 27:11.238
Yeah, it is rare.

27:14.720 --> 27:16.809
Some of us get
a glimpse, though.

27:16.852 --> 27:19.594
What do you mean?

27:19.638 --> 27:22.815
Um...

27:22.858 --> 27:25.818
In ten years,

27:25.861 --> 27:28.342
there's going to be an accident.

27:30.344 --> 27:33.739
It doesn't end well for me.

27:33.782 --> 27:36.480
Even the best
of Federation medicine

27:36.524 --> 27:38.091
won't be able to help me.

27:38.134 --> 27:40.310
How can you know this?

27:41.660 --> 27:43.444
I know.

27:43.487 --> 27:46.316
Our doctors
are capable of things

27:46.360 --> 27:49.363
that you can't imagine.

27:49.406 --> 27:50.581
Only...

27:50.625 --> 27:52.496
Only?

27:52.540 --> 27:54.411
Only you'd...

27:54.455 --> 27:57.458
have to be one of us.

27:57.501 --> 28:00.069
To live here,

28:00.113 --> 28:01.418
our way.

28:01.462 --> 28:04.987
Science, service, sacrifice?

28:08.774 --> 28:10.210
[sighs]

28:10.253 --> 28:12.865
That future is still
very far away.

28:14.388 --> 28:18.261
-Sorry, I've overstepped.
-Mm, no, you didn't.

28:18.305 --> 28:20.176
Thank you for telling me.

28:20.220 --> 28:22.091
You'd be welcome here.
It's just...

28:25.747 --> 28:29.142
...another part
of the future to consider.

28:38.455 --> 28:40.283
You called, Cadet?

28:40.327 --> 28:42.982
You asked for a needle
in a haystack, and I found it.

28:43.025 --> 28:44.505
I translated their dialect

28:44.548 --> 28:46.072
and cross-checked it
the old-fashioned way,

28:46.115 --> 28:47.813
and I know where they're from.

28:47.856 --> 28:50.250
-So, you did the bare minimum
I asked for.
-No.

28:50.293 --> 28:51.730
I also parsed their dialects

28:51.773 --> 28:53.644
and isolated the roots
of their language.

28:53.688 --> 28:56.212
I found more
than what you asked for.

28:57.605 --> 29:00.086
A lot more.

29:04.873 --> 29:07.484
I think we should take this
to the Captain.

29:07.528 --> 29:10.226
-Okay. Well, let me know
what he says.
-Cadet.

29:10.270 --> 29:13.142
It's your work.
You should present it.

29:15.536 --> 29:18.278
If you're sure
of your findings, that is.

29:20.106 --> 29:22.673
I am, sir.

29:22.717 --> 29:24.980
Right.

29:30.812 --> 29:32.814
[children giggling in distance]

29:46.219 --> 29:47.350
Rukiya?

29:47.394 --> 29:51.093
Dad, look what he made.

29:51.137 --> 29:53.922
Sorry, I hope you're not mad.

29:53.966 --> 29:55.837
The grid was just
made of noble gasses

29:55.881 --> 29:57.708
I took from the
atmospheric processor.

29:57.752 --> 30:00.537
They're non-reactive,
so I figured they'd be safe.

30:00.581 --> 30:02.844
Darling.

30:02.888 --> 30:04.411
You shouldn't be up.

30:07.675 --> 30:09.764
Please sit.

30:09.808 --> 30:11.157
[grunts]

30:12.854 --> 30:15.030
I was having fun.

30:19.556 --> 30:21.210
How did you know about her?

30:21.254 --> 30:23.082
You and the Elder talk loud,

30:23.125 --> 30:25.736
and when I couldn't find anyone
with cygnokemia in sickbay,

30:25.780 --> 30:28.870
I checked the places
I'd try to hide in.

30:28.914 --> 30:31.177
Do I have to go back in?

30:31.220 --> 30:33.179
Yes.

30:38.097 --> 30:40.360
But maybe not for much longer.

30:48.716 --> 30:50.022
Goodbye, Rukiya.

30:50.065 --> 30:51.675
I didn't mean
to get you in trouble.

31:02.948 --> 31:04.906
You can't tell anyone about her.

31:04.950 --> 31:06.255
Why not?

31:07.474 --> 31:09.606
[door whooshes open]

31:09.650 --> 31:11.826
I heard some noises.
What's going on?

31:15.482 --> 31:17.701
I was just looking
for a midnight snack.

31:17.745 --> 31:19.051
GAMAL:
Seems more like
you were showing off.

31:19.094 --> 31:21.053
Come on. We're going.

31:25.971 --> 31:28.756
I beamed up.
Someone want to explain to me

31:28.799 --> 31:32.020
why I had to hear this extremely
urgent report in person?

31:32.064 --> 31:33.587
Some information
has come to light

31:33.630 --> 31:35.067
that we thought
you might want to discuss

31:35.110 --> 31:38.026
without the risk
of Minister Alora overhearing.

31:38.070 --> 31:40.768
And what could that
possibly be?

31:40.811 --> 31:42.726
Cadet Uhura?

31:49.255 --> 31:50.952
UHURA:
We matched the language
spoken by the kidnappers

31:50.996 --> 31:54.086
to a non-Federation colony.
Prospect 7.

31:54.129 --> 31:57.132
That's an L-Class planet
a couple light years away.

31:57.176 --> 31:59.221
Very barren, harsh climate.

31:59.265 --> 32:01.920
The colony is barely
above a subsistence level.

32:01.963 --> 32:03.182
Yes.
Alora told us about them.

32:03.225 --> 32:04.487
I suppose it makes sense.

32:04.531 --> 32:05.662
Desperate people
do desperate things.

32:05.706 --> 32:07.621
Here's the surprising part.

32:07.664 --> 32:09.971
This language has common roots

32:10.015 --> 32:12.191
with the dialect
spoken on Majalis.

32:12.234 --> 32:14.802
Linguistically speaking,
it's impossible.

32:14.845 --> 32:16.760
This colony
isn't alien, Captain.

32:16.804 --> 32:18.675
It has to be an offshoot
off Majalis.

32:18.719 --> 32:21.461
At the end of the day,
we have to ask ourselves:

32:21.504 --> 32:24.203
why would anyone leave paradise
for Prospect 7?

32:24.246 --> 32:27.293
-There has to be a reason.
-And if the colony is connected
to Majalis,

32:27.336 --> 32:28.903
why would Elder Gamal
and Minister Alora

32:28.947 --> 32:30.035
tell us otherwise?

32:32.254 --> 32:34.256
Majalans aren't trusting
of outsiders.

32:34.300 --> 32:36.476
That's how Alora and I met.
Her shuttle failed.

32:36.519 --> 32:39.435
It led to an invitation
to join the Federation.

32:39.479 --> 32:41.046
If that accident
had never happened,

32:41.089 --> 32:43.178
I'm not sure our two peoples
would have ever met.

32:43.222 --> 32:45.702
-There must be a reasonable
explanation for this.
-[comm chimes]

32:45.746 --> 32:47.966
M'Benga to Bridge.

32:48.009 --> 32:50.142
Elder Gamal just walked out
with the First Servant.

32:50.185 --> 32:52.274
I couldn't stop them.
They said they were

32:52.318 --> 32:54.798
going back to the planet.

32:57.323 --> 32:59.542
GAMAL:
Captain, good.
Tell your Transporter Chief

32:59.586 --> 33:01.370
that we need to return
to the surface now.

33:01.414 --> 33:03.459
PIKE:
We agreed that the First
Servant was safer here.

33:03.503 --> 33:05.331
If I could ask you
to step down.

33:05.374 --> 33:07.463
With due respect,
I don't believe you're truly

33:07.507 --> 33:10.553
capable of keeping him
safe here.

33:10.597 --> 33:12.425
Who told you
you could beam them down?

33:12.468 --> 33:13.992
No, it wasn't me, Captain.

33:14.035 --> 33:15.950
Someone else must have
locked onto their signals

33:15.994 --> 33:18.083
-while our shields were down.
-What the hell is going on?

33:18.126 --> 33:19.693
See if you can get them back.

33:19.736 --> 33:21.477
Pike to Bridge.
Number One, I need you to scan

33:21.521 --> 33:23.131
for nearby ships.

33:23.175 --> 33:24.611
UNA:
Reading one, Captain.

33:24.654 --> 33:26.134
A combat cruiser
attempting to flee.

33:30.660 --> 33:32.097
Where is the First Servant?

33:33.359 --> 33:34.708
-Red alert.
-[alarm blaring]

33:34.751 --> 33:36.797
[boatswain's whistle blows]

33:39.626 --> 33:41.932
Status.

33:41.976 --> 33:43.325
SPOCK:
Sensors pick up the
First Servant's life signs

33:43.369 --> 33:45.066
on the combat cruiser.

33:45.110 --> 33:47.199
Their deflector shields prevent
us from beaming him back.

33:47.242 --> 33:49.462
-Have we tried hailing them?
-Several times.

33:49.505 --> 33:52.508
-They're ignoring us.
-I'll remind them we're bigger.

33:54.119 --> 33:55.250
Mitchell, deploy
a tractor beam.

33:55.294 --> 33:56.512
We can't let them go to warp.

33:56.556 --> 33:58.688
Targeting and deploying
now, sir.

34:06.783 --> 34:09.134
Sir, they're going
to warp anyway.

34:09.177 --> 34:11.266
They really want to play
tug-of-war with us?

34:14.139 --> 34:17.055
The stress is creating
a catastrophic strain imbalance.

34:17.098 --> 34:19.709
I have to increase our
structural integrity field.

34:19.753 --> 34:20.797
If they still
try to go to warp,

34:20.841 --> 34:22.190
it could destroy the cruiser.

34:22.234 --> 34:23.974
We can't risk harming them.
Disengage.

34:25.933 --> 34:27.543
Now, Mitchell.

34:50.175 --> 34:52.394
How could this happen, Chris?

34:52.438 --> 34:55.136
-You said he was safe.
-It's an unimaginable loss.

34:55.180 --> 34:57.356
If the Federation
can be of any assistance

34:57.399 --> 34:59.009
guiding your people
through it...

34:59.053 --> 35:01.055
There's nothing
to guide us through.

35:01.099 --> 35:02.709
It means our world is over.

35:02.752 --> 35:06.278
Alora, it's a tragedy,

35:06.321 --> 35:08.932
and I understand the symbolic
significance, but...

35:08.976 --> 35:10.369
You don't understand.

35:10.412 --> 35:12.545
If the First Servant
doesn't ascend,

35:12.588 --> 35:15.287
Majalis will
fall out of the sky.

35:15.330 --> 35:18.942
The surface of our planet
is nothing but rivers of lava

35:18.986 --> 35:21.641
and lakes of acid.
We'll be destroyed.

35:21.684 --> 35:24.731
How can any of that
rest on the fate of one child?

35:27.908 --> 35:29.518
Damn it.

35:29.562 --> 35:31.564
Can someone tell me how the hell

35:31.607 --> 35:34.697
that combat cruiser managed
to beam someone off my ship?

35:36.525 --> 35:38.005
UHURA:
I think I can,

35:38.048 --> 35:39.615
Captain.

35:45.534 --> 35:47.188
The girl is deluded.

35:47.232 --> 35:48.233
I'm not.

35:48.276 --> 35:50.278
She is just summarizing facts

35:50.322 --> 35:51.671
and drawing
the logical conclusion.

35:51.714 --> 35:52.976
Isn't that right, Uhura?

35:53.020 --> 35:56.502
Yes, sir. Thank you.

35:56.545 --> 35:57.938
Walk me through it, Cadet.

35:57.981 --> 35:59.592
To beam someone
off the Enterprise

35:59.635 --> 36:01.115
without us knowing about it,
you'd have to lock on

36:01.159 --> 36:03.161
to that signal really fast.

36:03.204 --> 36:04.945
Which means you'd need
full biopatterns

36:04.988 --> 36:06.860
like the ones we keep on file
in sickbay.

36:06.903 --> 36:09.689
So, I checked our records,
and it turns out

36:09.732 --> 36:11.778
Elder Gamal accessed them
right before he took

36:11.821 --> 36:14.694
-the First Servant
to the transporter room.
-GAMAL: I'm his doctor.

36:14.737 --> 36:16.391
I'm entitled
to his medical records.

36:16.435 --> 36:17.827
UHURA:
You didn't just access
his biopattern,

36:17.871 --> 36:19.220
you did a full scan
on yourself

36:19.264 --> 36:20.569
and uploaded that, too.

36:22.354 --> 36:24.617
LA'AN:
I think my promising young cadet
just demonstrated

36:24.660 --> 36:26.923
Lesson Seven of security on you.

36:26.967 --> 36:30.362
Leave no stone unturned.

36:30.405 --> 36:32.233
I usually require cadets
to look under

36:32.277 --> 36:34.192
Mugatan breathing stones
for that one.

36:34.235 --> 36:36.019
-Oh...
-LA'AN: That won't be necessary.

36:36.063 --> 36:37.891
What aren't you
telling us, Gamal?

36:39.371 --> 36:40.937
Now's the time.

36:45.115 --> 36:48.554
-[comm chimes]
-SPOCK: Captain, can you join me
on Deck 17?

36:48.597 --> 36:51.252
I have discovered something
I think you need to see.

36:51.296 --> 36:54.995
Okay.
Escort the Elder to the brig.

36:58.651 --> 37:00.479
[door whooshes open]

37:00.522 --> 37:04.134
The First Servant was a rather
ingenious child, Captain.

37:04.178 --> 37:06.006
He devised a method
of generating

37:06.049 --> 37:08.269
his own subspace channel
on an unused frequency.

37:08.313 --> 37:10.750
I thought there might be
some utility in monitoring it.

37:10.793 --> 37:13.622
And I assume that's why
you dragged me down here.

37:13.666 --> 37:16.059
This is a distress signal
from him.

37:16.103 --> 37:17.583
[beeping]

37:17.626 --> 37:19.628
How?

37:19.672 --> 37:21.674
No one on that combat cruiser
could have survived.

37:21.717 --> 37:24.459
Perhaps he was never
on that combat cruiser.

37:24.503 --> 37:26.461
I believe his kidnappers
transported him

37:26.505 --> 37:28.637
to where the signal originates:

37:28.681 --> 37:31.074
-here, on Enterprise.
-[beeping speeds up]

37:31.118 --> 37:32.989
To be precise...

37:36.645 --> 37:38.256
...right here, Captain.

37:47.439 --> 37:49.919
It's all right.
You're safe now.

37:49.963 --> 37:53.401
Okay? Come with me.

37:53.445 --> 37:54.620
Let's get him to sickbay.

37:54.663 --> 37:56.491
I need to get to
the ascension.

37:56.535 --> 37:58.580
There will be plenty of time
for all that.

37:58.624 --> 38:02.149
No, it's starting now.
Majalis needs me.

38:02.192 --> 38:04.673
Okay.

38:04.717 --> 38:06.284
Captain to Bridge.

38:06.327 --> 38:08.198
Open a channel to Majalis
and tell Minister Alora

38:08.242 --> 38:10.026
I've got some news
she'll want to hear.

38:11.201 --> 38:13.203
-[crowd cheering]
-♪

38:27.696 --> 38:31.526
ALORA:
As the First Servant dedicates
himself to Majalis,

38:31.570 --> 38:34.529
all of Majalis
dedicates itself to him.

38:35.922 --> 38:37.663
It's, uh, it's beautiful.

38:40.927 --> 38:43.625
It wouldn't have happened
without you, Chris.

38:43.669 --> 38:45.018
You saved us.

38:47.020 --> 38:49.327
You-you still haven't explained
how the fate of your planet

38:49.370 --> 38:52.373
could rest on the head
of this child.

38:52.417 --> 38:55.376
It's complicated.
Sacrosanct.

38:55.420 --> 38:57.987
Or why Elder Gamal
would kidnap his own son

38:58.031 --> 38:59.946
and put the fate
of his planet at risk.

38:59.989 --> 39:01.339
I can't speak to the motives

39:01.382 --> 39:02.818
-of one...
-Or why you

39:02.862 --> 39:05.038
failed to mention that
the kidnapping plot

39:05.081 --> 39:07.257
started on a colony
of your people:

39:07.301 --> 39:09.347
Prospect 7.

39:15.048 --> 39:17.746
We begin the procession.

39:17.790 --> 39:20.358
Rejoice.

39:27.103 --> 39:29.367
I shouldn't be in here.
I'm not a Federation citizen.

39:29.410 --> 39:31.020
I've done nothing wrong.

39:31.064 --> 39:32.457
You tampered with
the Enterprise'stransporter,

39:32.500 --> 39:34.720
using it to illegally
transport a minor,

39:34.763 --> 39:37.026
whom you then hid on our ship.

39:37.070 --> 39:39.986
A violation of multiple
Federation laws.

39:40.029 --> 39:43.250
I took my own child
for his safety.

39:44.904 --> 39:48.037
Is that why your associates
had a neural dampening device?

39:48.081 --> 39:50.388
-For his safety?
-Yes.

39:50.431 --> 39:52.259
Its purpose

39:52.302 --> 39:55.044
is to make him unable
to fulfil his duties

39:55.088 --> 39:56.219
as the First Servant.

39:56.263 --> 39:57.873
I want to talk to Captain Pike.

39:57.917 --> 40:00.267
Captain Pike is on Majalis
with the First Servant,

40:00.310 --> 40:02.704
so I'm afraid
you're stuck with me.

40:02.748 --> 40:04.967
You returned him?

40:07.100 --> 40:09.581
Mm.

40:09.624 --> 40:13.236
-So the ceremony has begun?
-By now,

40:13.280 --> 40:16.718
-presumably, yes.
-I was wrong.

40:16.762 --> 40:20.461
I deserve to be in here,
Commander, I know that.

40:20.505 --> 40:22.594
I didn't just...

40:22.637 --> 40:24.987
violate the law of my planet,

40:25.031 --> 40:26.511
I violated my own principles.

40:26.554 --> 40:29.383
My most deeply held beliefs.

40:31.211 --> 40:32.342
Why?

40:32.386 --> 40:34.344
For him.

40:37.304 --> 40:39.088
For my son.

40:41.134 --> 40:44.050
It was unthinkable,

40:44.093 --> 40:47.619
and I-I just needed to save him.

40:47.662 --> 40:49.708
From what?

40:50.883 --> 40:52.928
-[cheering, clamoring]
-♪

40:53.929 --> 40:55.670
MALE:
Thank you!

40:55.714 --> 40:57.542
Where are they taking him?

40:57.585 --> 40:59.979
The Sacred Chamber.

41:00.022 --> 41:02.242
We've never
let an outsider in before,

41:02.285 --> 41:05.158
but the Ruling Council
agreed to let you

41:05.201 --> 41:07.073
be a part of this
because you saved his life.

41:07.116 --> 41:10.076
And also...

41:10.119 --> 41:11.904
because I want you
to be a part of this.

41:13.558 --> 41:14.863
A part of what?

41:14.907 --> 41:17.213
FIRST SERVANT:
Captain.

41:17.257 --> 41:19.520
Come with us.

41:19.564 --> 41:21.043
I want you to be there
when I ascend.

41:21.087 --> 41:23.089
[Alora chuckles]

41:23.132 --> 41:24.743
SHANKAR:
I've-I've tried everything.

41:24.786 --> 41:27.528
The planet's put up some kind
of electromagnetic pulse

41:27.572 --> 41:29.182
that's blocking
our communications.

41:29.225 --> 41:31.271
Mr. Spock,
prepare a landing party

41:31.314 --> 41:32.577
to beam down to the surface.

41:34.187 --> 41:36.276
Negative, Commander.
There is interference

41:36.319 --> 41:37.625
in the planetary atmosphere.

41:37.669 --> 41:39.366
The same energy signature
as the pulse.

41:39.409 --> 41:41.237
You're saying there's
no way to contact the captain

41:41.281 --> 41:43.022
exactly when I need
to talk to him?

42:07.916 --> 42:11.093
Do you freely offer
this gift of self

42:11.137 --> 42:13.922
to the people of Majalis?

42:13.966 --> 42:17.447
With joy and gratitude, I do.

42:17.491 --> 42:20.276
Do you freely choose your fate?

42:20.320 --> 42:22.540
With joy and gratitude...

42:23.541 --> 42:25.412
I...

42:27.545 --> 42:29.111
Oh, my God.

42:35.640 --> 42:37.903
It's okay.

42:37.946 --> 42:39.513
He can see.

42:55.921 --> 42:57.836
PIKE:
It's a child.

42:58.837 --> 43:00.316
Stop it.

43:00.360 --> 43:02.014
[grunting]

43:02.057 --> 43:05.191
Alora, Alora...

43:05.234 --> 43:06.975
Alora, you have to stop this.

43:07.019 --> 43:09.761
He chooses it freely.

43:09.804 --> 43:12.546
And we honor his sacrifice.

43:12.590 --> 43:14.809
What?

43:21.599 --> 43:23.601
ALORA:
Long live the First Servant.

43:23.644 --> 43:25.080
Alora.

43:25.124 --> 43:27.474
Alora, you can't
do this to him. Stop!

43:28.736 --> 43:29.737
You can't.

43:29.781 --> 43:31.347
[grunting]

43:39.268 --> 43:41.227
[whimpers]

44:11.692 --> 44:14.303
What did you do to that boy?

44:14.347 --> 44:16.958
That last thing I want to do
is hurt you.

44:18.917 --> 44:21.702
So I'm your prisoner now?

44:21.746 --> 44:23.530
Of course not.

44:25.750 --> 44:27.665
The ascension is complete.

44:27.708 --> 44:29.667
You may go.

44:32.495 --> 44:34.323
You can go, too.

44:35.585 --> 44:37.631
But I hope you won't.

44:39.851 --> 44:42.157
You're damn right I'm going.

44:42.201 --> 44:44.725
Getting that child
the hell away from that thing.

44:44.769 --> 44:46.901
Even if you could
get into the chamber...

44:48.686 --> 44:50.992
...severing the connection
would only kill him.

45:04.832 --> 45:07.226
Why?

45:08.270 --> 45:10.969
Serving Majalis
is his destiny.

45:12.405 --> 45:14.189
His reason for being.

45:15.451 --> 45:17.149
Without him,
Majalis could not be.

45:17.192 --> 45:20.718
You plugged a kid
into a machine.

45:22.197 --> 45:24.156
What's it gonna do to him?

45:24.199 --> 45:26.898
We don't know.

45:26.941 --> 45:30.684
The machine needs the neural
network of a child to function.

45:30.728 --> 45:33.121
Our founders designed it
that way. We don't know why.

45:33.165 --> 45:35.733
We've hunted for centuries
for alternatives

45:35.776 --> 45:37.386
and found nothing.

45:37.430 --> 45:39.737
It was the purpose
of my research when we met.

45:39.780 --> 45:41.086
Will he suffer?

45:41.129 --> 45:43.392
Yes.

45:43.436 --> 45:45.264
We don'’t pretend otherwise.

45:45.307 --> 45:47.570
We live in gratitude for him.

45:47.614 --> 45:51.270
And when a new First Servant
ascends, we will live for her.

45:51.313 --> 45:54.055
Your whole civilization...

45:55.927 --> 45:59.713
All your... This.

46:02.150 --> 46:04.762
It's all founded

46:04.805 --> 46:06.981
on the suffering of a child.

46:07.025 --> 46:09.941
Can you honestly say
that no child suffers

46:09.984 --> 46:12.334
for the benefit
of your Federation?

46:15.555 --> 46:17.992
That no child lives in poverty

46:18.036 --> 46:20.821
or squalor,

46:20.865 --> 46:23.998
while those who enjoy abundance
look away?

46:29.787 --> 46:32.572
The only difference
is we don't look away.

46:32.615 --> 46:34.182
And because of that,
the suffering is borne

46:34.226 --> 46:36.184
on the back of only one.

46:36.228 --> 46:38.317
That's what makes it
a sacred honor.

46:38.360 --> 46:41.929
That's why I choose our way.

46:45.977 --> 46:47.935
No.

46:51.896 --> 46:53.419
The first chance I get...

46:55.073 --> 46:56.814
...I'm reporting this
to Starfleet.

46:56.857 --> 46:58.206
And what?

46:59.686 --> 47:02.776
We're not a Federation world.
You have no jurisdiction.

47:09.130 --> 47:11.916
Maybe, in the future,

47:11.959 --> 47:13.918
you'll feel differently.

47:13.961 --> 47:16.398
-[communicator chips]
-Now, Number One.

47:30.760 --> 47:33.459
Doctor, a word.

47:33.502 --> 47:35.548
Sorry for the interruption.

47:35.591 --> 47:38.725
It's fine.

47:38.768 --> 47:42.729
I'm told you've requested
transit to Prospect 7.

47:42.772 --> 47:44.774
I used to think they were
a planet of traitors

47:44.818 --> 47:46.689
committed to destroying
our way of life.

47:46.733 --> 47:48.256
And now?

47:48.300 --> 47:50.476
They tried to help me
save my child,

47:50.519 --> 47:52.739
and I failed.

47:54.654 --> 47:56.177
But maybe I could...

47:57.744 --> 47:59.920
...help them save the next one.

47:59.964 --> 48:01.400
I wish you luck.

48:01.443 --> 48:02.836
And I you, Doctor.

48:02.880 --> 48:04.185
Which is why I'm here.

48:04.229 --> 48:07.710
That hypothetical patient
with cygnokemia--

48:07.754 --> 48:10.104
her case stuck with me.

48:10.148 --> 48:12.237
I thought perhaps if I could
take a look at the file,

48:12.280 --> 48:14.674
I could walk you through
the theory behind the treatment.

48:14.717 --> 48:16.067
It's not a cure, but...

48:16.110 --> 48:19.070
But it could be
the first step to one.
