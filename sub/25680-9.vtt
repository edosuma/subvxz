13:09.497 --> 13:11.541
Horse Face Guy
went on to success

13:11.624 --> 13:12.917
because he had talent.

13:13.001 --> 13:15.462
Whereas I, according to
Birthday Party magazine,

13:15.545 --> 13:19.174
"was depressing"
and "refused to leave."

13:19.257 --> 13:22.844
Check, and check.

13:22.927 --> 13:27.015
And in a few hours,
my master plan will be complete.

13:27.098 --> 13:29.517
'Cause when I take off
this horse mask,

13:29.601 --> 13:31.811

Does it seem
like they're stalling?

20:34.317 --> 20:35.485
I don't know.

20:35.568 --> 20:37.153
Ever since that little blond girl
hypnotized me,

20:37.237 --> 20:38.822
I don't know what's going on.

20:38.905 --> 20:40.031
Why don't we
wrap this up

20:40.115 --> 20:41.366
and get to the unmasking?

20:41.449 --> 20:42.450
That's a good idea.

20:42.534 --> 20:44.411
I've got midnight bowling
with Ed Sheeran.

20:45.995 --> 20:46.830
[applause]

20:47.205 --> 20:48.832
Thank you,
thank you.

20:48.915 --> 20:51.418
That was...

20:52.419 --> 20:53.795
something.

20:57.382 --> 21:00.593
Now, it's time for the moment
we've all been waiting for.

21:00.677 --> 21:04.347
It's time to find out...
Who. Is. Horse Face Guy?

21:04.472 --> 21:06.391
[cheering and applause]

21:13.106 --> 21:14.524
Stop the show!

21:14.607 --> 21:15.900
The person
under that mask

21:15.984 --> 21:17.444
isn't who you think it is.

21:17.527 --> 21:19.612
You've been watching an imposter.

21:19.696 --> 21:20.530
[audience gasping]

21:21.114 --> 21:23.491
This is the real
Horse Face Guy.

21:23.575 --> 21:25.076
[audience gasps]

21:32.417 --> 21:33.960
-Who's who?
-I don't know.

21:40.675 --> 21:42.135
This is awful.

21:42.218 --> 21:44.387
This is viewers!

21:45.347 --> 21:46.723
How are we
gonna figure out

21:46.806 --> 21:49.017
who's fake and who's real?

21:49.100 --> 21:50.894
There's only one way
to know for sure.

21:50.977 --> 21:53.355
Both of you do the Horsie dance.

21:53.438 --> 21:54.731
[audience cheering]

21:54.814 --> 21:56.107
[upbeat techno music playing]

22:10.872 --> 22:12.207
Am I doing it?

22:12.290 --> 22:13.958
Feels like I'm doing it.

22:15.043 --> 22:18.296
Officer,
there's your man.

22:18.380 --> 22:21.132
No, no, no.

22:22.759 --> 22:24.219
No! I'm Horse Face Guy!

22:24.302 --> 22:25.553
I'm the real Horse Face Guy.

22:25.637 --> 22:26.721
I can prove it.

22:26.805 --> 22:29.265
Um, neigh! Neigh!

22:31.768 --> 22:34.437
That was weird, huh?

22:34.521 --> 22:37.190
But we got
this Horse Face Guy right here.

22:37.273 --> 22:40.235
So why don't we just
unmask this sucker?

22:40.318 --> 22:42.445
Show your face!

22:42.529 --> 22:44.030
[All chanting]

22:45.949 --> 22:47.283
Show your face!

22:47.367 --> 22:48.451
Guys, no.

22:48.535 --> 22:51.579
Listen, Horse Face Guy
didn't want any of this.

22:51.663 --> 22:54.958
You really wanna know
who Horse Face Guy is?

22:55.834 --> 22:57.502
He's my friend.

22:57.585 --> 22:59.129
And if keeping
his identity a secret

22:59.212 --> 23:01.381
is important to him,
then it's important to me.

23:01.464 --> 23:03.508
And as his fans,
it should be important

23:03.591 --> 23:04.592
to all of you too.

23:04.676 --> 23:05.510
[audience murmuring]

23:06.011 --> 23:06.845
[slow clap]

23:07.429 --> 23:09.639
[applause builds]

23:14.185 --> 23:15.770
This.

23:15.854 --> 23:18.481
This is why I entertain.

23:18.565 --> 23:20.567
Everybody get your butts
out your chairs

23:20.650 --> 23:23.153
and show some love
to Horse Face Guy!

23:23.236 --> 23:24.070
[cheers and applause]

23:24.863 --> 23:26.531
Let's do the Horsie!

23:27.866 --> 23:29.492
[upbeat techno music playing]

23:35.373 --> 23:37.542
Lou Scoopmaker here
to break another hot scoop.

23:37.625 --> 23:39.210
Oh, uh.
You missed it.

23:39.294 --> 23:40.879
They already took
the fake Horse Face Guy to jail.

23:40.962 --> 23:43.089
So, not a hot scoop?

23:44.007 --> 23:45.842
In that case,
mind if I dance?

23:48.803 --> 23:50.513
[music continues playing]

24:03.818 --> 24:05.111
Thank you, Bernie,

24:05.195 --> 24:06.488
for always believing in me.

24:06.571 --> 24:09.115
I don't want to show
my face to the world,

24:09.199 --> 24:10.867
but I do want to show you.

24:10.950 --> 24:11.785
[rubber squeaking]

[angelic choir]

Tom Brady?

24:15.413 --> 24:16.706
What? No.

24:16.790 --> 24:19.000
John Cena?

24:19.084 --> 24:20.627
-No.
-Jimmy Fallon?

24:20.710 --> 24:21.836
No.

24:21.920 --> 24:22.921
Paul Rudd?

24:23.004 --> 24:24.381
-No.
-Chris Pratt?

24:24.422 --> 24:25.632
-No.
-Channing Tatum?

24:25.715 --> 24:27.217
-No!
-Zac Efron?

24:27.300 --> 24:28.551
This was a mistake.
