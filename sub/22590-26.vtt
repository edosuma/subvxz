00:09.552 --> 00:12.347
<i>NARRATOR".
A tranquil day in Gotham City.</i>

00:12.514 --> 00:14.849
<i>And what could be more soothing...</i>

00:15.558 --> 00:20.021
<i>...than a couple of hours
in Minerva's Mineral Spa?</i>

00:22.273 --> 00:26.945
For a millionaire who does nothing but count
money, Mr. Wayne, you stay in fair condition.

00:27.111 --> 00:32.534
Oh, I try to keep pretty active
with falconry and spelunking.

00:32.700 --> 00:37.163
And you people here at Minerva's Mineral Spa
keep me in pretty good shape.

00:37.455 --> 00:39.541
Well, that'll about do it for you, sir.

00:39.707 --> 00:43.628
Unless, of course, you'd like one of Minerva's
Eggplant Jelly Vitamin Scalp Massages.

00:43.795 --> 00:46.297
No, I've got to get dressed and get out of here.
Thank you.

00:46.464 --> 00:49.467
<i>NARRATOR". But for another millionaire
not so pressed for time...</i>

00:49.634 --> 00:52.262
<i>...the renowned scalp massage of Minerva...</i>

00:52.428 --> 00:55.473
<i>...one of Gotham City's
most beautiful and glamorous women...</i>

00:55.640 --> 00:58.685
<i>...is about to produce some amazing results.</i>

00:58.851 --> 01:00.520
Tell me, darling...

01:00.687 --> 01:04.440
...how did you collect
that divine fortune of yours?

01:04.607 --> 01:08.027
By never taking a beautiful woman
at face value, Minerva.

01:08.194 --> 01:11.322
Ha, ha. Tell me some more, darling.

01:11.489 --> 01:14.534
Tell me, where do you keep that fortune?

01:16.000 --> 01:22.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:25.587 --> 01:29.007
Two million dollars' worth
of negotiable securities...

01:29.173 --> 01:32.969
...in the grandfather's clock, of course.

01:33.136 --> 01:36.347
Well, of course.

01:42.186 --> 01:44.522
There you are, darling.

01:44.689 --> 01:48.693
Atlas, put Mr. Dozier
into my perfumed pressurizer.

01:54.032 --> 01:56.451
<i>NARRATOR".
And still another millionaire...</i>

02:00.246 --> 02:01.789
Tell me, darling...

02:01.956 --> 02:05.376
...how did you become
a rich television producer?

02:05.543 --> 02:08.045
By never hiring method actors, Minerva.

02:08.211 --> 02:11.049
And by always ignoring network executives.

02:11.215 --> 02:13.051
Tell me some more.

02:13.217 --> 02:17.055
Where do you keep
that lovely loot of yours?

02:27.732 --> 02:30.610
In the television set, of course.

02:30.777 --> 02:32.487
But of course.

02:37.158 --> 02:38.409
Here you are, darling.

02:38.576 --> 02:40.620
I hope you enjoyed your treatment.

02:40.787 --> 02:44.916
Minerva, after every visit to your spa,
I always feel like a new man.

02:45.083 --> 02:48.461
Hmm. I feel like a new man too, Bruce.

02:49.754 --> 02:52.131
Bruce. Bruce Wayne.

02:52.298 --> 02:54.008
- Hello, Sam. How are you?
-Thank you.

02:54.175 --> 02:58.221
My wife was thrilled to get that invitation
to the private Wayne Foundation showing...

02:58.388 --> 03:00.139
...of the greatest diamonds next week.

03:00.306 --> 03:03.518
A very interesting affair.
Most of the major stones are here already.

03:03.685 --> 03:04.977
Under lock and key, I hope.

03:05.144 --> 03:07.480
Oh, yes, they're quite safe
in the Wayne Foundation vault.

03:07.647 --> 03:11.442
Ah. Oh, Minerva, has my wife
shown up to pick me up yet?

03:11.609 --> 03:12.860
I'll check with Aphrodite.

03:14.779 --> 03:16.197
Anything wrong, darling?

03:16.739 --> 03:20.493
I thought I left my wristwatch in this box.

03:20.660 --> 03:24.122
Aphrodite, did Mr. Shubert's wife arrive yet?

03:24.288 --> 03:26.457
She's in the waiting room. This way, please.

03:26.624 --> 03:30.044
- Thank you. Minerva, Bruce, I'll see you later.
-Yes, goodbye, Sam.

03:30.211 --> 03:31.504
You were saying?

03:31.671 --> 03:35.925
Oh, it's nothing.
I must have been mistaken. Good day.

03:36.092 --> 03:38.636
Come back soon, darling.

03:40.304 --> 03:41.597
Those emeralds, Minerva...

03:41.764 --> 03:44.642
...they were in Mrs. Carson's cookie jar,
just like you said.

03:44.809 --> 03:47.979
Of course they were,
but I'm no longer interested in the emeralds.

03:48.146 --> 03:51.357
Now that I have a way to get
into the Wayne Foundation vault.

03:51.524 --> 03:53.568
- That watch.
-Yes, that watch.

03:53.735 --> 03:57.947
With this watch, I'm going to have my hands
on the world's largest diamonds.

03:58.114 --> 04:03.536
And thus glorious, glamorous,
glittering power.

05:13.898 --> 05:16.651
Freddie, I have some fast fencing
for you to do.

05:17.193 --> 05:21.739
I am not known as, in fact, "French
Freddie the Fence" for nothing, Minerva.

05:21.906 --> 05:25.868
Shortly, I'll have the combination
of the Wayne Foundation vault...

05:26.035 --> 05:29.247
...and then you'll have the world's
largest diamonds to fence.

05:29.747 --> 05:33.334
Famous diamonds are not easy to fence,
Minerva.

05:33.501 --> 05:37.046
Heh. If I can get them, Freddie...

05:37.213 --> 05:39.715
...you can fence them.

05:41.759 --> 05:44.136
Frankly, I'm stumped.

05:44.303 --> 05:49.267
And only Mr. Dozier knew those securities
were in that grandfather's clock.

05:50.560 --> 05:54.230
And Mr. Horwitz's cash out of his TV set.

05:54.397 --> 05:56.566
But someone else stole them,
commissioner.

05:56.732 --> 05:59.235
Right, and Mrs. Shubert's pearls
out of her tea urn...

05:59.402 --> 06:01.863
...and Mr. Converse's bonds
out of a sleeping bag.

06:02.029 --> 06:04.282
Well, if you ask me, millionaires in this city...

06:04.448 --> 06:07.326
...certainly choose strange hiding places
for their valuables.

06:07.493 --> 06:10.913
But known only to themselves, Barbara.

06:11.080 --> 06:15.251
Each swears no other soul alive
was in on their secret.

06:15.418 --> 06:19.630
But we ought to let someone else in
on our problem, commissioner.

06:19.797 --> 06:21.507
Your problem, Chief O'Hara...

06:21.674 --> 06:24.886
...is that leg of yours that you sprained
when playing Ping-Pong.

06:25.052 --> 06:28.389
I'll take care of the little things
like stolen bonds...

06:28.556 --> 06:31.976
...and emeralds and securities.

06:32.143 --> 06:33.728
You found my watch, Minerva?

06:33.895 --> 06:38.065
Yes, Bruce. It must have fallen out of the box
when I unlocked it.

06:38.232 --> 06:39.859
I'll send someone down for it.

06:40.026 --> 06:42.320
Why don't you come for it yourself?

06:43.696 --> 06:47.325
- A <i>special treat</i> for <i>you.</i>
- A treat, Minerva? I'll be there shortly.

06:47.491 --> 06:50.244
- One moment, sir.
-Yes, commissioner?

06:50.411 --> 06:52.288
<i>Batman, we need your help.</i>

06:52.455 --> 06:56.083
About a rash of robberies
for which there is no explanation.

06:56.250 --> 06:59.670
<i>Millionaire William Dozier's securities
stolen out of a grandfather's clock...</i>

06:59.962 --> 07:04.342
...oil heiress Camille Carson's emeralds
from her cookie jar...

07:04.508 --> 07:08.220
<i>...producer Howie Horwitz's cash
out of his TV set.</i>

07:08.387 --> 07:12.058
We'll be there as quickly as possible,
but first I have one errand to run.

07:12.224 --> 07:13.684
- Did you hear that, Dick?
-A bit.

07:13.851 --> 07:17.021
Emeralds, cookie jars, bonds and TV sets.

07:17.188 --> 07:21.776
It's the victims that make this case intriguing
and unique. They're all immensely wealthy.

07:21.943 --> 07:25.363
And they're all frequenters
of Minerva's Mineral Spa.

07:25.529 --> 07:28.950
Gosh, Bruce. Would Minerva stoop
to something like that?

07:29.116 --> 07:32.244
It's hard to believe, Dick.
She's so beautiful...

07:32.411 --> 07:34.705
...and worth investigating.

07:34.872 --> 07:37.249
- To the Batpoles?
-You to the Batpoles, Dick.

07:37.416 --> 07:40.294
I want you to take the Batmobile
with a spare Batsuit for me.

07:40.461 --> 07:42.964
And I want you to meet me
in the alley behind the spa.

07:43.130 --> 07:45.633
I'll take my own car
and be sure and find you.

07:45.800 --> 07:46.926
Roger.

07:48.469 --> 07:50.262
I came here to pick up a wristwatch...

07:50.429 --> 07:53.849
...and I get a free
Eggplant Jelly Vitamin Scalp Massage.

07:54.016 --> 07:56.936
That was my special little treat,
on the house...

07:57.103 --> 07:59.855
...because of that silly misunderstanding
over your watch.

08:00.022 --> 08:02.775
Now, this is only going to take a minute.

08:16.122 --> 08:19.333
The combination
to the Wayne Foundation vault?

08:19.500 --> 08:22.378
Right seven times to eight...

08:22.545 --> 08:25.923
...left four times past six to 11.

08:26.090 --> 08:28.426
Right twice to nine...

08:28.592 --> 08:33.847
...left to three, and open.

08:40.855 --> 08:43.107
Oh. That was marvelous, Minerva.

08:43.274 --> 08:45.860
Heh. There you are, my darling.

08:46.027 --> 08:49.488
Your root ends are really glowing.

08:52.450 --> 08:54.785
Here you are, darling.

08:55.870 --> 08:57.455
Thank you.

08:59.498 --> 09:03.544
Are you sure I can't pay you anything
for the special treatment, Minerva?

09:03.711 --> 09:06.130
Seeing you again was payment enough.

09:07.506 --> 09:09.175
Excuse me.

09:09.925 --> 09:12.803
Minerva's Mineral Spa.

09:12.970 --> 09:14.889
Lord Easystreet?

09:15.056 --> 09:18.642
Hello, Easy. I haven't seen you for ages.

09:18.809 --> 09:21.145
I'll meet you in the alley in a moment.

09:21.312 --> 09:26.067
I don't know what's up in here, but I suspect
Batman and Robin should investigate further.

09:26.233 --> 09:30.154
Yes, yes, 4:30 is good enough
for a scalp massage.

09:30.321 --> 09:33.157
Tell Commissioner Gordon
that we might be detained.

09:33.407 --> 09:37.661
Divine, darling, divine.

09:39.789 --> 09:43.667
- How did it go, Minerva?
-Beautifully. But...

09:45.419 --> 09:47.088
Hello.

09:47.254 --> 09:49.006
We'd like the full treatment, please.

09:49.340 --> 09:53.010
Well, of course.
Register for both yourself and your son.

09:54.595 --> 09:57.014
Although I'd be proud if he were,
this is not my son.

09:57.181 --> 10:00.101
This is Robin, the Boy Wonder. I'm Batman.

10:00.392 --> 10:02.728
Well, I'm so sorry,
I couldn't recognize your face.

10:02.895 --> 10:05.689
But your physique was very familiar.

10:07.483 --> 10:12.196
Check your valuables. After you've disrobed,
Adonis and Apollo are going to start you off.

10:12.363 --> 10:13.948
We have no valuables to check.

10:14.115 --> 10:17.952
And if we disrobed,
we'd reveal our secret true identities.

10:18.119 --> 10:22.206
That's too bad. You can't get the full value
of my mineral spa fully dressed.

10:22.665 --> 10:26.168
Our boots, leotards, gauntlets, capes, cowls
and even our utility belts...

10:26.335 --> 10:29.171
...are more permeable than you might think.

10:29.338 --> 10:30.548
Shall we start?

10:30.714 --> 10:32.800
This way, gentlemen.

10:39.306 --> 10:40.933
What's the matter, Minerva?

10:41.100 --> 10:45.146
I don't know, but my female intuition
tells me there's something wrong.

10:46.230 --> 10:49.150
I had the strange feeling
that millionaire Bruce Wayne...

10:49.316 --> 10:51.652
...was issuing instructions
through his watch.

10:52.069 --> 10:56.407
- Huh?
-And Batman is a close friend of his.

10:56.574 --> 11:00.035
Be sure that those dynamic darlings
get our full treatment.

11:00.202 --> 11:04.957
Including some extra pressurizing
in my perfumed pressurizer.

11:05.124 --> 11:07.251
Persimmon pressurizer, Minerva.

11:07.585 --> 11:10.212
Call it whatever you want, but do it...

11:10.379 --> 11:13.924
...while I'm going
to the Wayne Foundation vault.

11:16.343 --> 11:21.432
Yes, I'm looking forward to Minerva's famous
Eggplant Jelly Vitamin Scalp Massage.

11:21.599 --> 11:24.935
Minerva thought you might pop them
into the persimmon pressurizer first.

11:25.102 --> 11:28.898
Persimmon pressurizer?
Holy astringent plum-like fruit.

11:29.064 --> 11:31.358
Only astringent until ripe, Robin.

11:31.525 --> 11:35.988
I think you'll find the experience
most palatable. This way, gentlemen.

11:38.574 --> 11:40.618
Atlas, what's up?

11:40.784 --> 11:43.454
Minerva wants them
permanently pressurized.

11:54.465 --> 11:58.761
The experience may be palatable, Batman,
but I don't like the looks of this thing.

11:58.928 --> 12:00.304
Me neither, Robin.

12:00.804 --> 12:03.474
It's not how the pressurizer looks
that counts, Batman.

12:03.641 --> 12:04.767
Uh-huh.

12:04.934 --> 12:07.269
It's how you're going to look
when you're in it.

12:07.436 --> 12:09.021
And when it's finished with you.

12:14.443 --> 12:18.322
<i>NARRATOR". So mischievous Minerva
pursues her malfeasant maneuver...</i>

12:18.489 --> 12:20.199
<i>...at the Wayne Foundation.</i>

12:20.366 --> 12:22.910
"Left to three."

12:26.705 --> 12:29.625
And voilà. Oh.

12:30.292 --> 12:35.714
Oh, you beautiful, beautiful darlings.

12:36.882 --> 12:41.303
Oh. I love you, I love you.

12:42.930 --> 12:45.015
Some more.

12:47.351 --> 12:54.108
<i>While our fearless crime-fighters face a fate
usually befalling frozen foods.</i>

12:55.859 --> 12:57.861
Holy human pressure cookers.

12:58.028 --> 13:02.032
An apt expression, Robin. Too apt.

13:13.502 --> 13:17.589
- Minerva, they're gone.
-They are not gone, they are just not here.

13:17.756 --> 13:19.258
Isn't that the same thing?

13:19.425 --> 13:22.219
They are completely pressurized.

13:22.386 --> 13:25.556
There's nothing left of the little darlings.

13:25.723 --> 13:30.060
- Well, then let's take off with their loot.
-Not until my dear friend Lord Easystreet...

13:30.227 --> 13:33.230
...has his vitamin scalp massage at 4:30.

13:33.397 --> 13:35.065
Why wait for that?

13:35.232 --> 13:37.401
Because he's the world's richest man.

13:37.568 --> 13:40.571
And just think about the thoughts
he's going to transfer.

13:40.738 --> 13:43.073
Think about the thoughts
millionaire Bruce Wayne...

13:43.240 --> 13:46.118
...transfers to the police
when he finds the diamonds are gone.

13:46.285 --> 13:50.164
I reset the dial. It will take them
at least two weeks before they can get in.

13:50.331 --> 13:52.291
And in the meanwhile...

13:52.916 --> 13:55.419
<i>NARRATOR".
But in the meantime, what's this?</i>

13:55.586 --> 13:59.006
<i>The pressurized campaigners alive?</i>

14:01.133 --> 14:05.304
<i>And heading into the Batcave
on the double?</i>

14:06.513 --> 14:10.642
<i>Where a vastly relieved Alfred awaits them.</i>

14:11.018 --> 14:13.437
I must say, sir,
I'm delighted to see you both.

14:13.604 --> 14:17.232
We're delighted to be here and wouldn't be
if Batman hadn't the foresight...

14:17.399 --> 14:20.611
...to pop two Steam-Neutralizing Bat-pellets
into his utility belt.

14:20.861 --> 14:22.988
Steam-Neutralizing Bat-pellets?

14:23.155 --> 14:25.783
I'll explain later.
I must get to Commissioner Gordon.

14:25.949 --> 14:28.660
About Madame Minerva, I presume?

14:28.827 --> 14:30.120
Definitely about Minerva.

14:30.287 --> 14:33.207
Her three Greek goons popped us
into a human pressure cooker.

14:33.665 --> 14:34.958
Oh, my word.

14:35.125 --> 14:38.629
And soon we'll be finding out
how Minerva fits into the picture, Alfred.

14:38.796 --> 14:42.466
And how you may be fitting into the picture.

14:43.008 --> 14:44.051
Me?

14:45.803 --> 14:51.642
My three beautiful boys put Batman
and Robin in my perfumed pressurizer...

14:51.809 --> 14:53.477
...and pressurized them to death?

14:54.812 --> 14:57.564
That's utter nonsense. Ha, ha.

14:57.731 --> 15:01.026
It isn't nonsense that they tried to, Minerva.

15:01.735 --> 15:05.072
How young and healthy
you both look after treatment in my spa.

15:05.239 --> 15:08.659
We're lucky we even look alive
after that pressure cooking.

15:08.826 --> 15:12.746
I am so sorry. Something must have
gone wrong with one of the machines.

15:12.913 --> 15:17.501
But to accuse me and my staff
for attempting murder...

15:17.668 --> 15:19.503
...is completely ridiculous.

15:20.754 --> 15:24.007
Well, now that this little misunderstanding
is straightened out--

15:24.174 --> 15:27.052
Not exactly straightened out, Minerva.

15:27.219 --> 15:30.514
Just where did you pick up
those three male assistants?

15:30.681 --> 15:34.351
I don't pick up men, men pick me up.

15:34.518 --> 15:36.854
But really, Batman, don't be so square.

15:37.354 --> 15:43.652
In an hour's time, I have an appointment
with my dear old friend Lord Easystreet...

15:43.819 --> 15:47.281
...for a vitamin scalp massage.

15:47.448 --> 15:50.451
I mustn't disappoint him.

15:50.993 --> 15:52.202
Oh, no, of course not.

15:52.369 --> 15:56.373
I'm sorry we inconvenienced you
by asking you to come here.

15:56.540 --> 15:59.710
Not at all. Not at all.

15:59.877 --> 16:04.006
- May I show you to the elevator?
- Yes, please.

16:08.302 --> 16:10.929
Ah, Barbara. Minerva, my daughter.

16:11.096 --> 16:12.681
Hello.

16:12.848 --> 16:14.892
Good bye.

16:17.895 --> 16:21.231
Well, the fabulous Minerva.

16:22.566 --> 16:24.485
Who knows just how fabulous?

16:24.651 --> 16:27.613
What's the matter?
You all look as sober as a glass of water.

16:27.779 --> 16:31.158
An attempt on one's life
has a rather sobering effect, Ms. Gordon.

16:31.325 --> 16:34.244
Someone tried to kill you, Batman?
And Robin?

16:36.246 --> 16:37.456
Was Minerva involved?

16:37.748 --> 16:40.584
It's hard to say, at this point.

16:40.751 --> 16:42.669
Sure, and it is.

16:42.836 --> 16:45.130
What are your plans, Batman?

16:45.297 --> 16:48.258
Chief O'Hara, I know someone
who bears a striking resemblance...

16:48.425 --> 16:49.801
...to Lord Easystreet.

16:49.968 --> 16:51.845
Gosh, yes. So you do, Batman.

16:52.012 --> 16:58.101
And if he were to be detained so that
he couldn't make his 4:30 appointment...

16:58.268 --> 17:00.646
...at Minerva's--
-Say no more, Batman.

17:00.812 --> 17:03.148
Lord Easystreet was in the library
this morning...

17:03.315 --> 17:06.151
...looking for a rare volume
on the vesper sparrow.

17:06.318 --> 17:09.738
He's a multimillionaire bird watcher,
among his other multis.

17:09.905 --> 17:14.785
I could call and tell him I've found the book,
which I did, at one of the branch libraries.

17:14.952 --> 17:18.204
That should distract him
from any plans he might have this afternoon.

17:21.750 --> 17:24.752
What a charming and beautiful lady
Minerva is.

17:24.920 --> 17:27.798
We should all be ashamed
of our suspicions.

17:30.425 --> 17:32.135
Commissioner Gordon.

17:32.302 --> 17:36.098
What? What? What?

17:36.682 --> 17:40.102
Well, of course. We'll get on it at once.

17:40.811 --> 17:44.356
- What was all that?
-The head of security at the Wayne Foundation.

17:44.523 --> 17:48.485
Someone's tampered with the vault containing
precious diamonds for that private showing.

17:48.652 --> 17:51.363
The combination's changed.
No one knows if anything was taken.

17:51.530 --> 17:53.615
I must try and get in touch
with Bruce Wayne.

17:53.782 --> 17:57.494
Oh, you mean millionaire Bruce Wayne?
I believe he's out of town for the day.

17:57.661 --> 17:59.705
I'd better make that call about the book.

17:59.871 --> 18:02.666
I think His Lordship is staying
at the Gotham Towers.

18:02.833 --> 18:06.920
Now, who is that man who bears
such a striking resemblance...

18:07.087 --> 18:09.506
...to multimillionaire Lord Easystreet?

18:09.673 --> 18:13.510
Coincidentally,
it's millionaire Bruce Wayne's butler, Alfred.

18:15.178 --> 18:17.514
You won't believe this,
but they are still alive.

18:17.681 --> 18:19.391
We better make tracks quick, then.

18:19.558 --> 18:22.686
Not until my dear old friend
Lord Easystreet--

18:25.272 --> 18:27.232
Go on, boys, go on.

18:27.858 --> 18:29.901
Hello, Minerva.

18:30.068 --> 18:33.905
My dear, surely you recognize me.
I'm Lord Easystreet.

18:34.072 --> 18:36.908
Oh, of course, Easy.

18:37.075 --> 18:40.871
It's only that you're a little bit thinner
and little tiny bit older.

18:42.247 --> 18:46.627
Well, the years have a way of catching up
with us multimillionaires, Minerva...

18:46.793 --> 18:48.712
...just as with the common people.

18:48.879 --> 18:55.677
But perhaps your Eggplant Jelly Vitamin
Scalp Massage might prove rejuvenating.

18:55.844 --> 19:00.349
It does wonders, Easy.
Not miracles but wonders.

19:00.515 --> 19:02.726
- Shall we try?
-Ha, ha.

19:06.396 --> 19:09.441
They're gone.
Every diamond in that vault is gone.

19:10.484 --> 19:12.694
Batman,
how could you have opened a vault...

19:12.861 --> 19:15.989
...to which you didn't know the combination
in three seconds flat?

19:16.156 --> 19:19.743
With my Three-Seconds-Flat Bat-vault
Combination Unscrambler, commissioner.

19:19.910 --> 19:22.996
- Amazing.
-I must notify the insurance companies at once.

19:23.163 --> 19:27.250
And we must throw a cordon of police
around Gotham City, Chief O'Hara. Come on.

19:30.962 --> 19:32.756
Well, Batman, back to the Batcave?

19:32.923 --> 19:35.926
No, Robin. To Minerva's Mineral Spa.

19:36.093 --> 19:38.011
I strongly suspect...

19:38.178 --> 19:41.848
...she extracted the combination to this vault
from Bruce Wayne's brain...

19:42.015 --> 19:45.894
...via her Eggplant Jelly
Vitamin Scalp Massage.

19:46.061 --> 19:49.398
- Holy skull tap.
-Exactly, Robin.

19:49.564 --> 19:52.609
Which she might be doing
at this very moment with Alfred.

19:52.776 --> 19:55.737
Extracting secrets he must never reveal.

19:55.904 --> 19:57.656
To the spa.

19:59.157 --> 20:04.705
<i>NARRATOR". While at this very minute,
Barbara Gordon has had a similar hunch...</i>

20:04.871 --> 20:08.625
...has <i>made her challenging change
into Batgirl...</i>

20:08.792 --> 20:12.045
<i>...and is off to do her bit for Alfred...</i>

20:12.212 --> 20:15.424
<i>...aboard the Batgirl-cycle.</i>

20:19.219 --> 20:21.179
Just relax, darling...

20:21.346 --> 20:25.809
...and think about
your many, many, many millions.

20:36.820 --> 20:39.990
It should be clear to almost anyone...

20:40.323 --> 20:43.994
...that I am not
multimillionaire Lord Easystreet...

20:44.161 --> 20:45.579
...but actually I am--

20:45.746 --> 20:47.831
But actually I am--

20:47.998 --> 20:49.249
But actually I am--

20:49.416 --> 20:51.251
But actually I am--

20:52.419 --> 20:56.339
Go on, darling. Don't stall now. Don't stall.

20:59.342 --> 21:02.679
- Batgirl, stop it, stop it, stop it!
-Just let go!

21:02.846 --> 21:05.182
Adonis, Apollo, come and help!

21:05.348 --> 21:07.601
Help! Help!

21:07.768 --> 21:09.269
Grab her. Grab him.

21:09.436 --> 21:11.563
He's a darling old phony.

21:11.730 --> 21:13.815
Put them both in my perfumed pressurizer...

21:13.982 --> 21:16.777
...while I get Freddie the Fence
and start packing.

21:27.579 --> 21:30.957
Higher, boys. Put it on high.
Freddie the Fence has flown.

21:34.044 --> 21:37.881
Any extra Steam Neutralizing Bat-pellets,
Batman?

23:18.315 --> 23:22.944
I must say, Batgirl, it was rather fortunate
that this thing short-circuited...

23:23.111 --> 23:27.407
...before I divulged my-- Our little secret.

23:27.574 --> 23:30.452
Yes. I'd say it was too, Alfred.

23:30.619 --> 23:31.661
Darling.

23:42.756 --> 23:46.718
So, darlings, you caught Freddie the Fence
just before he flew.

23:46.885 --> 23:50.263
- At the airport, Minerva.
-Just as he started to sing.

23:50.430 --> 23:54.851
I told you, Minerva, it is not easy
to fence famous diamonds.

23:55.018 --> 23:58.146
Easier than to try to fly
without wings, Freddie.

23:58.313 --> 23:59.481
Ah.

23:59.648 --> 24:02.025
There are some more songbirds
in the rear of the store.

24:02.192 --> 24:04.194
Plus a canary named Aphrodite.

24:04.361 --> 24:08.239
Maybe I should have called it
Minerva's Musical Spa.

24:08.406 --> 24:10.825
It has rhythm, Minerva.

24:11.201 --> 24:16.247
So has the paddy wagon,
and it's raring to go. Go on.

24:16.414 --> 24:17.791
How divine.

24:17.958 --> 24:22.754
I'm going to make Gotham State Prison
the world's most elegant spa.

24:32.305 --> 24:34.349
What happened to Batgirl?

24:35.475 --> 24:38.645
Who knows, Robin? Whoever knows?
