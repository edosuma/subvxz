narrator: ARTISTS CLASHED
WHILE TATTOOING TAG TEAM.

00:19.811 --> 00:20.729

00:20.812 --> 00:21.938
DON'T DO THE DARK ONE.

00:22.021 --> 00:23.189
GET THAT LINE SMOOTHER.

00:23.273 --> 00:25.191
- DUDE, SHUT UP.
WE ALREADY KNOW.

00:25.275 --> 00:26.484
YOU'RE THE MAN.

00:26.568 --> 00:29.279
- JAY IS ONLY FOCUSING
ON HIS PARTS OF THE TATTOO.

00:29.362 --> 00:31.614
YOU SHOULD REALLY START
THE COLOR ON THE ELEPHANT.

00:31.698 --> 00:32.615
- [chattering]

00:32.698 --> 00:34.576
JUST PUT YOUR NOSE DOWN
AND TATTOO.

00:34.659 --> 00:35.785
JUST GET IT DONE.

00:35.869 --> 00:38.288
- IT WAS JUST A LOT TO BE LEFT
IN THAT LAST HOUR.

00:38.371 --> 00:39.873
- SHE'S BASICALLY PLAYING
THE DAMSEL IN DISTRESS.

00:39.956 --> 00:42.375
GROW THE [bleep] UP, GIRL.

00:42.459 --> 00:44.961
- IF YOU WORK BAD ON A TEAM,
YOU'RE BOTH IN TROUBLE.

00:46.504 --> 00:49.799
JAY'S NINE LIVES ARE UP.
IT IS TIME FOR HIM TO GO HOME.

IN THE ELIMINATION...

00:51.217 --> 00:54.846
- MELISSA AND JAY, YOU HAVE
THE WORST TATTOO OF THE DAY.

ONLY ONE OF YOU WILL BE
PACKING YOUR MACHINES.

IN A SHOCKING TWIST,

00:59.684 --> 01:02.979
MELISSA AND GENTLE JAY
HAD TO FACE OFF TO SURVIVE.

01:03.062 --> 01:03.730
- I'M GONNA HELP MELISSA
BEAT JAY.

01:03.813 --> 01:05.940
KARMA'S A BITCH, DUDE.

01:06.024 --> 01:07.650
- THEY GANG UP AGAINST ME.

01:07.734 --> 01:09.736
BAH!

01:09.819 --> 01:12.363
- FOR ME, LOOKING AT
THESE TWO TATTOOS SIDE BY SIDE,

01:12.447 --> 01:13.865
{\an8}IT'S A TEETER-TOTTER
RIGHT NOW.

01:13.948 --> 01:16.367
{\an8}BUT JAY TOOK AWAY FROM
THIS DESIGN BY ADDING TOO MUCH.

01:16.451 --> 01:20.622
- JAY, YOU DO NOT HAVE
WHAT IT TAKES TO BE INK MASTER.

01:20.705 --> 01:24.125
- [bleep] YOU, SCOTT.

IT'S JUST GONNA LOOK SILLY.

04:20.593 --> 04:21.678
- THE MORE RECOGNIZABLE
AN IMAGE IS,

04:54.252 --> 04:56.504
{\an8}- THE STATUE OF LIBERTY IS
PRETTY DAMN RECOGNIZABLE,

{\an8}SO THERE'S NO ROOM
FOR ERROR IN THE SKETCH.

05:00.216 --> 05:01.884

OR THE ARM'S TOO SHORT
OR THE FACE IS TOO FAT,

THE MAIN PROPORTIONS IN MIND.

05:41.382 --> 05:44.802
{\an8}DRAWING IS SOMETHING
I KNOW I EXCEL AT.

{\an8}I'M GONNA [bleep] NAIL SCOTT.

05:46.596 --> 05:48.431
{\an8}- I WAS ACCUSED
OF NOT BEING ABLE

05:48.514 --> 05:50.099
{\an8}TO DRAW IN THIS COMPETITION.

05:50.183 --> 05:52.101
- I HAVE SUSPICIONS THAT SCOTT

05:52.185 --> 05:53.269
HAS BEEN TRACING
ALL OF HIS [bleep].

05:53.352 --> 05:55.480
- I USE REFERENCES
IN DOING TATTOOS LIKE THIS.

05:55.563 --> 05:56.647
IT'S [bleep] SMART.

05:56.731 --> 05:58.775
MAYBE YOU SHOULD TRY IT,
BITCH.

05:58.858 --> 06:00.109
- [bleep].

06:00.193 --> 06:01.444
- I'VE BEEN DRAWING
MY WHOLE LIFE.

06:01.527 --> 06:03.279
I'M GONNA SQUASH
THAT [bleep] TODAY

06:03.362 --> 06:06.699
AND SHOW THESE GUYS
THAT I CAN [bleep] DRAW.

06:06.783 --> 06:09.285
{\an8}- THE BOAT'S MOVING,

06:09.368 --> 06:11.829
{\an8}AND THE STATUE
IS CONSTANTLY TURNING.

06:11.913 --> 06:13.247
IS THERE
A BATHROOM ANYWHERE?

06:13.331 --> 06:17.335
THE ROCKING OF THE BOAT STARTS
SENDING ME INTO COLD SWEATS.

06:17.418 --> 06:18.961
THINK I'M GONNA THROW UP.

06:19.045 --> 06:19.962
I'M GETTING SEASICK

06:20.046 --> 06:22.882
AT THE ABSOLUTE WORST
POSSIBLE TIME.

06:22.965 --> 06:24.300
[groans]

06:24.383 --> 06:26.928
- 30 MINUTES LEFT,
EVERYBODY.

06:27.011 --> 06:28.346
- HOW ABOUT THIS?

06:28.429 --> 06:29.472
YOU JUST COME OVER HERE
AND DRAW MINE FOR ME,

06:29.555 --> 06:32.308
AND THEN I'LL--
I'LL FINISH YOURS.

06:32.391 --> 06:33.392
[laughs]
- NO DEAL.

06:33.476 --> 06:34.644
- THIS IS TOP FIVE.

06:34.727 --> 06:36.646
{\an8}I'M DEFINITELY SWIMMING
WITH THE BIG FISH.

06:36.729 --> 06:39.440
EVERYONE LEFT HERE IS
REALLY, REALLY STRONG,

06:39.524 --> 06:40.733
AND IT'S PRETTY TERRIFYING.

06:40.817 --> 06:43.444
COME ON, SCOTT.
YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO.

06:43.528 --> 06:45.071
- WHEN I SEE THAT
ALL THE OTHER ARTISTS ARE DOING

06:45.154 --> 06:46.948
A FULL-SIZE STATUE OF LIBERTY,

06:47.031 --> 06:48.825
{\an8}I DECIDED TO TAKE AN APPROACH
THAT'S DIFFERENT

06:48.908 --> 06:50.243
{\an8}THAN EVERYBODY ELSE.

06:50.326 --> 06:52.328
I'M TRYING TO SHOW THE JUDGES
PROPORTION IN MY SKETCH

06:52.411 --> 06:54.330
BY MAKING SURE THAT
THE EYES ARE THE RIGHT SIZE

06:54.413 --> 06:55.164
COMPARED TO THE NOSE,
COMPARED TO THE MOUTH,

06:55.248 --> 06:57.542
AND THE HEAD WITH THE HAND.

06:57.625 --> 07:00.002
- IF YOU'RE NOT DRAWING
THE WHOLE STATUE OF LIBERTY,

07:00.086 --> 07:03.005
{\an8}YOU SHOULD BE DISQUALIFIED.

07:03.089 --> 07:05.091
- FIVE, FOUR,

07:05.174 --> 07:07.844
THREE, TWO, ONE.

07:07.927 --> 07:09.720
THAT IS IT.
TIME IS UP.

07:09.804 --> 07:12.515
PENCILS DOWN.

07:12.598 --> 07:15.184
- MY DRAWING IS UNMISTAKABLY
BETTER THAN THE REST

07:15.268 --> 07:16.477
OF THE ARTISTS'
IN THIS CHALLENGE.

07:16.561 --> 07:18.646
I WANT TO WIN IT,
AND I'M GOING TO WIN IT.

07:18.729 --> 07:21.691
- HOW ARE YOU GUYS FEELING?
YOU FEELING CONFIDENT?

07:21.774 --> 07:22.775
WELL, I CERTAINLY HOPE SO,

07:22.859 --> 07:26.445
BECAUSE THIS CHALLENGE
IS NOT OVER.

07:26.529 --> 07:28.030
- OH, [bleep].

07:28.114 --> 07:30.241
- AS DIFFICULT AS THIS STATUE IS
TO DRAW,

07:30.324 --> 07:33.828
IT'S EVEN MORE DIFFICULT
TO TATTOO.

07:33.911 --> 07:37.165
YOU MUST TATTOO THE STATUE
OF LIBERTY ONTO A HUMAN CANVAS

07:37.248 --> 07:40.668
USING ONLY YOUR DRAWING
AS REFERENCE.

07:42.795 --> 07:44.881
LET'S HEAD BACK TO THE SHOP
AND MEET YOUR CANVASES.

07:49.594 --> 07:50.511

07:50.595 --> 07:52.013
- HEY. HALO.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

07:52.096 --> 07:55.141
- YOU HAVE THREE HOURS TO TATTOO
YOUR STATUE OF LIBERTY DESIGNS,

07:55.224 --> 07:59.270
AND YOUR TIME BEGINS NOW.

07:59.353 --> 08:01.230
- SO I HAVE, LIKE,
A FULL-BODY FRONTAL VIEW.

08:01.314 --> 08:03.065
- OKAY.
- ARE YOU DOWN?

08:03.149 --> 08:05.401
- YEAH.

08:05.484 --> 08:07.695
{\an8}- I THINK A LOT OF THESE ARTISTS
QUESTION AMONGST THEMSELVES

08:07.778 --> 08:10.406
{\an8}WHO'S A TRUE ARTIST
AND WHO ISN'T ON PAPER.

08:10.489 --> 08:13.618
{\an8}AND THIS IS A PERFECT WAY TO
SEPARATE THE MEN FROM THE BOYS.

08:13.701 --> 08:14.619
{\an8}- LET'S SEE HOW SHE SITS THERE.

08:14.702 --> 08:16.662
{\an8}- WE'LL JUST
KIND OF SHRINK HER DOWN,

08:16.746 --> 08:18.748
{\an8}SO THAT WAY THERE SHE CAN
HAVE A REALLY NICE FACE.

08:18.831 --> 08:21.375
{\an8}I'M A PERFECTIONIST,
AND I DON'T FEEL THAT MY SKETCH

08:21.459 --> 08:24.337
{\an8}IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR A TATTOO.

08:24.420 --> 08:26.047
I'M SCREWED.

08:26.130 --> 08:28.132
- I'VE ALREADY SHOWN PROPORTION
WITH MY DRAWING.

08:28.216 --> 08:30.885
ALL I NEED TO DO IS TATTOO IT
EXACTLY LIKE THE STENCIL.

08:33.971 --> 08:34.429
- FINAL HOUR.

08:34.514 --> 08:37.558
ONE MORE HOUR.

08:37.642 --> 08:39.268
- SCOTT ONLY USED SIX SPIKES.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.604
IF HE DOESN'T PUT
THAT SEVENTH SPIKE IN THERE,

08:41.687 --> 08:44.273
{\an8}THAT COULD COST SCOTT HIS WIN.

08:44.357 --> 08:46.067
- FIVE, FOUR,

08:46.150 --> 08:47.818
THREE, TWO,

08:47.902 --> 08:49.070
ONE.

08:49.153 --> 08:49.904
THAT'S IT.
MACHINES DOWN.

08:49.987 --> 08:53.157
TIME IS UP.
NO MORE INK.

08:53.241 --> 08:55.117
- YEAH, NOT--NOT--
NOT TOO BAD.

08:55.201 --> 08:55.993
- THIS PART IS CRAZY PERFECT.

08:56.077 --> 08:59.497
I LOVE IT.

08:59.580 --> 09:00.873
- DIGGING IT.

09:00.957 --> 09:02.208
- THERE WE GO, MAN.
- WOW.

09:02.291 --> 09:06.295
- SHE [bleep] SWEET OR WHAT,
DUDE?

09:06.379 --> 09:08.506
- SAUSAGE, HOW ARE YOU?
- EXCELLENT, THANKS.

09:08.589 --> 09:11.050
- THE ATTENTION TO DETAIL
YOU PUT INTO THE CROWN,

09:11.133 --> 09:13.052
THE TORCH, THE HAND IS GREAT.

09:13.135 --> 09:15.346
JUDGING PROPORTION, I WOULD'VE
LIKED TO HAVE SEEN SOME WAY

09:15.429 --> 09:17.974
TO REALLY PUT INTO PERSPECTIVE

09:18.057 --> 09:20.059
HOW MASSIVE
THIS ICONIC FIGURE IS.

09:20.142 --> 09:22.770
- THE WAY YOU ENDED THE TATTOO
IS YOUR BIGGEST FAULT.

09:22.853 --> 09:24.563
BECAUSE YOU CUT THAT SHOULDER
OFF A LITTLE TOO QUICK,

09:24.647 --> 09:26.816
IT KIND OF HAS
A SLANT ON THE BOTTOM,

09:26.899 --> 09:28.901
AND IT GIVES ME THE IMPRESSION
THAT SHE'S LEANING.

09:28.985 --> 09:30.736
BUT TATTOO QUALITY ON THIS,
VERY NICE.

09:30.820 --> 09:31.904
- THANK YOU.

09:31.988 --> 09:35.241
{\an8}- SAUSAGE DID ONE BREAST,
AN ARM, AND A HEAD.

09:35.324 --> 09:37.326
I'M SICK OF SEEING THE JUDGES
COMPLIMENT HIM

09:37.410 --> 09:41.664
ON HIS SKILL OF TATTOOING
WHEN HIS DESIGNS SUCK.

09:41.747 --> 09:43.124
- MELISSA.

09:43.207 --> 09:45.418
- SO I THINK YOU DID A PRETTY
GOOD JOB DOING A SKETCH OVERALL.

09:45.501 --> 09:47.503
THE SIZE OF THE TATTOO,
I PERSONALLY THINK IT'S GREAT.

09:47.586 --> 09:48.879
YOU DIDN'T GO OVERBOARD.

09:48.963 --> 09:50.673
THE MAIN ISSUE WE WANT
TO SEE IS THE RIGHT PROPORTION

09:50.756 --> 09:52.883
OF THE SIZE, AND IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU HAVE A NICE LAYOUT.

09:52.967 --> 09:54.468
YOU'VE HAD SOME ISSUES
WITH BLACK AND GRAY IN THE PAST.

09:54.552 --> 09:56.721
THIS IS A GREAT OUTING FOR YOU.

09:56.804 --> 09:58.764
IT'S A LOT SOFTER
AND A LOT NICER WORK.

09:58.848 --> 09:59.807
- THANK YOU.

09:59.890 --> 10:01.017
- MATTI.

10:01.100 --> 10:01.976
- PROPORTIONALLY,
I FEEL LIKE IT'S RIGHT.

10:02.059 --> 10:04.061
I LIKE HOW DARK YOU WENT
WITH THE SHADOWS

10:04.145 --> 10:06.856
AND HOW DRASTICALLY YOU SHADED
THE FOLDS AND THE CREASES

10:06.939 --> 10:09.233
TO GIVE IT A MORE VIVID,
MORE STRONG LOOK.

10:09.317 --> 10:10.985
IT'S A STANDOUT TATTOO.

10:11.068 --> 10:12.278
- HALO.

10:12.361 --> 10:14.697
- IT'S A VERY STYLISTIC
REPRESENTATION.

10:14.780 --> 10:16.866
THE CITY BEHIND IT
IS A DEFINITE PLUS.

10:16.949 --> 10:18.367
IT ADDS TO THE DEPTH
OF THIS IMAGE.

10:18.451 --> 10:20.244
BUT I FEEL LIKE IT COULD'VE BEEN
A LITTLE LIGHTER,

10:20.328 --> 10:23.372
TO PUSH WHAT YOU HAVE IN THE
FOREGROUND FARTHER IN THE FRONT.

10:23.456 --> 10:24.874
- THE FACIAL EXPRESSION
STANDS OUT TO ME.

10:24.957 --> 10:27.543
IT'S A REALLY GREAT JOB CATCHING
THAT STARK FACE.

10:27.626 --> 10:30.171
BEAUTIFUL TATTOO.

10:30.254 --> 10:31.547
- SCOTT.

10:31.630 --> 10:33.299
- THIS IS A REALLY NICE DRAWING
THAT YOU DID.

10:33.382 --> 10:36.177
YOU DEFINITELY HAVE THE ARTISTIC
SKILL TO MAKE IT LOOK THIS NICE.

10:36.260 --> 10:39.347
- THE PROPORTION IN THIS TATTOO
REALLY DOES SHOW HOW BIG SHE IS.

10:39.430 --> 10:41.140
THE CITYSCAPE REALLY BRINGS
THE STATUE FORWARD

10:41.223 --> 10:42.683
AND BRINGS IT TO LIFE.

10:42.767 --> 10:45.728
PROBLEM WITH THE TATTOO IS IT'S
MISSING ONE SPIKE IN THE CROWN,

10:45.811 --> 10:47.063
HAS SIX INSTEAD OF SEVEN.

10:47.146 --> 10:48.773
- GETTING THE WRONG NUMBER
OF SPIKES ON THERE,

10:48.856 --> 10:50.399
THE DETAILS ARE NOT THE SAME.

10:50.483 --> 10:53.235
BUT ADDING THE BASE ON THERE
MAKES FOR A GREAT TATTOO.

10:53.319 --> 10:55.488
{\an8}- I'M REALLY SURPRISED
THAT THE JUDGES DIDN'T HAVE

10:55.571 --> 10:57.031
{\an8}MORE NEGATIVE THINGS TO SAY
ABOUT SCOTT'S PIECE.

10:57.114 --> 11:00.117
HE LITERALLY MADE THE STATUE
OF LIBERTY LOOK OBESE.

11:00.201 --> 11:04.455
BRAVO, SCOTT.

11:04.538 --> 11:06.624
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
STATUE OF LIBERTY DRAWINGS,

11:06.707 --> 11:07.708
TESTING PROPORTION.

11:07.792 --> 11:08.918
- WE'RE DOWN TO THE FINAL FIVE.

11:09.001 --> 11:10.753
OVERALL, MAN,
WHAT A GREAT TURNOUT.

11:10.836 --> 11:12.088
- LET'S TALK
ABOUT MELISSA'S DESIGN.

11:12.171 --> 11:15.383
- MELISSA'S TATTOO HAD
A VERY LITTLE STATUE FEEL TO ME.

11:15.466 --> 11:17.927
- THAT'S WHAT I FELT LIKE.

11:18.010 --> 11:20.930
- IT DID SHOW MORE PROPORTION
THAN SOMEBODY LIKE SAUSAGE.

11:21.013 --> 11:23.432
- ALTHOUGH SAUSAGE PROBABLY GOT
THE NICEST DETAIL OF THE ROOM.

11:23.516 --> 11:24.767
- FANTASTIC.

11:24.850 --> 11:28.020
- THE DETAIL ON THE CROWN,
THE HAIR, THE TORCH, THE HAND--

11:28.104 --> 11:28.979
ALL THAT STUFF WAS CORRECT.

11:29.063 --> 11:30.106
- YEAH.

11:30.189 --> 11:31.440
- I REALLY LIKE MATTI'S TATTOO,

11:31.524 --> 11:32.900
JUST FOR THE FACT OF
HOW MUCH CONTRAST HE PUT IN IT.

11:32.983 --> 11:34.110
FROM ACROSS THE ROOM,

11:34.193 --> 11:36.237
IT REALLY STANDS OUT
AS BEING A BOLD IMAGE.

11:36.320 --> 11:39.156
- BUT THAT BACKGROUND, THAT
WAS JUST NEEDLESS TATTOOING.

11:39.240 --> 11:41.992
- THE BIG THING FOR ME TODAY IS
TO SEE SCOTT REALLY KILL IT

11:42.076 --> 11:44.286
ON THAT DRAWING
AFTER OTHER ARTISTS COMPLAINING

11:44.370 --> 11:45.579
THAT HE COULDN'T DRAW.

11:45.663 --> 11:48.374
BUT MISSING A MAJOR DETAIL
LIKE ONE OF THE SPIKES,

11:48.457 --> 11:50.000
THAT'S LIKE GETTING
A DATE WRONG.

11:50.084 --> 11:51.210
IT'S ONE OF THE BIG, PROMINENT
FEATURES OF THE SILHOUETTE

11:51.293 --> 11:53.295
OF THE IMAGE.

11:53.379 --> 11:54.755
- BUT I THINK THAT
THAT SOFT BACKGROUND

11:54.839 --> 11:57.758
CAMOUFLAGES
THAT SHORTCOMING.

11:57.842 --> 11:58.509
- HALO, I THOUGHT,
DID A GREAT JOB.

11:58.592 --> 12:00.928
- I LIKED HIS STATUE OF LIBERTY.

12:01.011 --> 12:03.764
THE PROPORTION OF HER FACE
AND HAND IS REALLY NICE.

12:03.848 --> 12:04.807
HE'S ONE OF THE ARTISTS TODAY
THAT CAPTURED

12:04.890 --> 12:06.100
THE STATUESQUE LOOK
ON THE FACE.

12:06.183 --> 12:08.185
- YEAH.

12:08.269 --> 12:08.811
- ALL RIGHT,
I THINK WE'RE DECIDED.

12:08.894 --> 12:10.229
- LET'S DO IT.

12:10.312 --> 12:13.232
- COOL.

12:13.315 --> 12:16.444
- TODAY YOU HAD TO TATTOO
ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS LANDMARKS

12:16.527 --> 12:17.820
IN THE WORLD,
THE STATUE OF LIBERTY.

12:17.903 --> 12:20.823
THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED
THAT THE WINNER

12:20.906 --> 12:22.908
OF TODAY'S FLASH CHALLENGE IS...

12:28.414 --> 12:29.331
HALO.

12:29.415 --> 12:30.875
- GOOD JOB.

12:30.958 --> 12:33.043
- WITH THIS BEING
A PROPORTION CHALLENGE,

12:33.127 --> 12:34.295
YOU HAVE TO MENTION HOW WELL

12:34.378 --> 12:36.172
YOU DID KEEPING THE STATUE
IN PROPORTION.

12:36.255 --> 12:37.131
VERY NICE.

12:37.214 --> 12:40.384
AND LUCKILY FOR YOU,
SCOTT MISSED

12:40.468 --> 12:42.178
A MAJOR ELEMENT OF HIS TATTOO

12:42.261 --> 12:44.013
BY ONLY PUTTING SIX SPIKES
ON THE CROWN

12:44.096 --> 12:45.347
INSTEAD OF SEVEN.

12:45.431 --> 12:47.683
ONE LITTLE SLIP-UP,
AND THE PERSON RIGHT BEHIND YOU

12:47.766 --> 12:49.059
IS RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU.

12:49.143 --> 12:50.352
- HALO WINS 'CAUSE I HAD
[bleep] ONE SPIKE MISSING?

12:50.436 --> 12:52.813
{\an8}BULL[bleep].

12:52.897 --> 12:56.609
{\an8}- HALO, YOU'LL HAVE THE POWER
TO ASSIGN ALL HUMAN CANVASES.

12:56.692 --> 12:57.985
{\an8}- I'M SO GLAD
THAT I WON THIS ONE.

12:58.068 --> 13:01.906
THERE IS DEFINITELY
NO BETTER TIME TO HAVE ADVANTAGE

13:01.989 --> 13:03.949
OVER THE SKULL PICKS
THAN RIGHT NOW.

13:04.033 --> 13:04.700
I'M THE ONE PULLING
THE TRIGGER NOW

13:04.783 --> 13:07.203
INSTEAD OF GETTING SHOT AT.

13:07.286 --> 13:08.370
- HEAD BACK TO THE LOFT

13:08.454 --> 13:10.039
AND PREPARE
TO MEET YOUR HUMAN CANVASES

13:10.122 --> 13:12.500
FOR THE ELIMINATION TATTOO.

13:15.544 --> 13:16.545
{\an8}- I'LL DEFINITELY
BE GUNNING FOR YOU.

13:16.629 --> 13:17.630
{\an8}IT'S A MEXICAN GUNFIGHT.

13:17.713 --> 13:19.131
{\an8}THE POINT IS TO BEAT YOU.

13:19.215 --> 13:21.884
{\an8}I HOPE THIS IS THE ONE
THAT KNOCKS SCOTT ON HIS ASS.

13:21.967 --> 13:24.678
{\an8}- I'M STRESSING
THE [bleep] OUT RIGHT NOW.

13:31.018 --> 13:32.186
- I ENVY THE FACT
THAT YOU GET

13:32.269 --> 13:33.604
TO PICK WHAT JOB YOU WANT
DOWN THERE.

13:33.687 --> 13:36.482
BUT, YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO TIPTOE AROUND IT, MAN.

13:36.565 --> 13:37.566
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOUR PLAN IS?

13:37.650 --> 13:38.859
ARE YOU GUNNING
FOR ME TODAY?

13:38.943 --> 13:40.444
- I'LL DEFINITELY BE GUNNING
FOR YOU.

13:40.528 --> 13:42.905
I'M THROWING SHOTS
AT EVERYBODY.

13:42.988 --> 13:45.074
- I WOULD HATE FOR ANYONE ELSE
TO GO HOME AT THIS POINT

13:45.157 --> 13:46.450
BUT MELISSA.

13:46.534 --> 13:49.078
- I DEFINITELY WOULDN'T PUT IT
PAST A MEXICAN GUNFIGHT

13:49.161 --> 13:50.746
GOING ON AND ALL OF US
SHOOTING AT EACH OTHER

13:50.829 --> 13:51.914
AND MELISSA SLIPPING BY.

13:51.997 --> 13:52.957
- TAKE THAT
INTO CONSIDERATION THEN TODAY

13:53.040 --> 13:54.250
WHEN YOU'RE PICKING SKULLS,
MAN.

13:54.333 --> 13:57.753
- FINALLY, SCOTT GETS A TASTE
OF HIS OWN MEDICINE.

13:57.836 --> 13:59.505
THE POINT OF BEING HERE
IS TO BEAT YOU,

13:59.588 --> 14:00.881
TO BEAT EVERYBODY HERE.

14:00.965 --> 14:02.550
THAT'S THE GAME
I'M GOING FOR.

14:02.633 --> 14:03.842
- I MIGHT BE TRYING
TO SWEET-TALK MY WAY

14:03.926 --> 14:05.594
TO GETTING A GOOD SKULL.
- THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

14:05.678 --> 14:06.804
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU KNOW--

14:06.887 --> 14:08.264
- NOT GONNA HAPPEN.
- NOT GONNA HAPPEN, HUH?

14:08.347 --> 14:09.473
- WHEN YOU HAD THE SKULL PICKS,

14:09.557 --> 14:10.516
YOU HAD NO PROBLEM
GUNNING FOR ME.

14:10.599 --> 14:12.560
SO IT'S TIME TO GO TOE-TO-TOE,

14:12.643 --> 14:13.936
AND IT'S JUST ABOUT DISHING BACK
WHAT I GOT.

14:14.019 --> 14:16.272
IF THERE'S A BAD ONE
IN THERE, DUDE,

14:16.355 --> 14:18.649
IT'S COMING RIGHT AT YOU.

14:32.329 --> 14:33.581
- WELCOME
TO THE ELIMINATION TATTOO.

14:33.664 --> 14:35.457
YOU NAIL THIS, AND YOU'LL HAVE
A ONE-IN-FOUR SHOT

14:35.541 --> 14:38.794
AT EARNING $100,000,

14:38.877 --> 14:39.753
A FEATURE IN <i> INKED MAGAZINE,</i>

14:39.837 --> 14:42.798
AND THE TITLE OF INK MASTER.

14:42.881 --> 14:44.133
AS ALWAYS, YOU'LL BE JUDGED

14:44.216 --> 14:46.635
BY OLIVER PECK,
CHRIS NUNEZ, AND MYSELF.

14:46.719 --> 14:48.304
BUT WE'RE NOT
YOU'RE ONLY CRITICS.

14:48.387 --> 14:51.640
EACH WEEK, YOU'LL ALSO
BE JUDGED BY AMERICA.

14:51.724 --> 14:53.809
VIEWERS AT HOME
WILL SCOUR EVERY DETAIL

14:53.892 --> 14:57.813
OF YOUR ELIMINATION TATTOOS
AT INKMASTER.SPIKE.COM

14:57.896 --> 15:00.357
AND VOTE FOR THE TATTOO
THAT THEY THINK IS THE BEST.

15:00.441 --> 15:02.901
AMERICA'S VOTE
WILL HAVE A MASSIVE IMPACT

15:02.985 --> 15:04.236
AT THE LIVE FINALE.

15:04.320 --> 15:05.654
IN THE ELIMINATION TATTOO,

15:05.738 --> 15:08.240
IT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER
TO WIN TATTOO OF THE DAY

15:08.324 --> 15:12.995
BECAUSE THE WINNER MUST PUT
ONE ARTIST UP FOR ELIMINATION.

15:13.078 --> 15:15.664
WE ALSO HAVE
A VERY SPECIAL GUEST JUDGE.

15:15.748 --> 15:17.458
TATTOOING FOR OVER 15 YEARS,

15:17.541 --> 15:20.002
HE'S THE OWNER
OF STATE OF GRACE TATTOO SHOP

15:20.085 --> 15:21.503
IN SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA--

15:21.587 --> 15:23.464
HORITAKA.

15:23.547 --> 15:24.423
- WOW.

15:24.506 --> 15:27.092
[applause]

15:27.176 --> 15:30.721
- I WOULD CALL MY STYLE
TRADITIONAL JAPANESE TATTOOING.

15:30.804 --> 15:31.513
I REALLY LIKE
TO DO BIG WORK, SLEEVES,

15:31.597 --> 15:33.015
BACK PIECES, BODYSUITS.

15:33.098 --> 15:36.852
{\an8}WHEN DONE RIGHT,
JAPANESE TATTOO CONVEYS HISTORY,

15:36.935 --> 15:38.812
{\an8}CULTURE, AND MYTHOLOGY
OF THE NATION.

15:38.896 --> 15:40.898
{\an8}- TAKI IS ONE
OF THE MOST RESPECTED FIGURES

15:40.981 --> 15:41.690
{\an8}WE HAVE IN TATTOOING.

15:41.774 --> 15:44.401
{\an8}A TRUE HONOR TO HAVE HIM HERE.

15:44.485 --> 15:46.820
{\an8}- THIS WEEK,
WE'RE TESTING PROPORTION.

15:46.904 --> 15:49.531
{\an8}- PROPORTION IS THE SIZE
OF OBJECTS

15:49.615 --> 15:51.659
{\an8}IN RELATION TO OTHER OBJECTS
IN A TATTOO.

15:51.742 --> 15:55.079
- TODAY YOU MUST ALL TATTOO
THE SAME SUBJECT,

15:55.162 --> 15:57.373
A JAPANESE SNAKE.

15:57.456 --> 15:58.791
- DAMN IT.

15:58.874 --> 15:59.833
- SNAKES ARE ONE
OF THE MOST SYMBOLIC CREATURES

15:59.917 --> 16:01.919
IN TRADITIONAL
JAPANESE TATTOOING.

16:02.002 --> 16:03.879
{\an8}- TRADITIONAL JAPANESE
IS REALLY HARD

16:03.962 --> 16:06.715
{\an8}BECAUSE IT HAS
A WHOLE LOT OF RULES IN IT.

16:06.799 --> 16:08.801
IF YOU DON'T KNOW THEM,
YOU CAN'T FOLLOW THEM,

16:08.884 --> 16:11.345
AND THE ONE GUY
WHO'S GONNA JUDGE YOU IS TAKI,

16:11.428 --> 16:13.681
AND HE'S GONNA
NAIL THE [bleep] OUT OF YOU.

16:13.764 --> 16:16.725
- JAPANESE TATTOOS ARE INFAMOUS
FOR INCORPORATING

16:16.809 --> 16:20.312
MANY DIFFERENT ELEMENTS
TO CREATE A DYNAMIC IMAGE.

16:20.396 --> 16:22.523
IN ORDER FOR THE ELEMENTS
TO WORK TOGETHER,

16:22.606 --> 16:25.317
THEY MUST BE
IN PERFECT PROPORTION.

16:25.401 --> 16:29.655
THERE IS ONE MORE OBSTACLE
YOU MUST FACE TODAY.

16:29.738 --> 16:33.742
ALL OF THE CANVASES
WANT THEIR TATTOOS

16:33.826 --> 16:36.912
ON THEIR RIBS.

16:36.995 --> 16:37.454
- OF COURSE THEY DO.

16:37.538 --> 16:39.540
- RIBS?

16:39.623 --> 16:41.291
{\an8}YOU'VE GOT
TO BE [bleep] KIDDING ME.

16:41.375 --> 16:42.626
{\an8}- WOW.

16:42.710 --> 16:45.003
{\an8}- THE RIBS IS
ONE OF THE MOST PAINFUL AREAS.

16:45.087 --> 16:46.672
WITH SNAKES,
IT'S GONNA BE HARD

16:46.755 --> 16:50.467
TO MAKE THOSE LONG,
SWEEPING LINES.

16:50.551 --> 16:52.010
- LET'S MEET YOUR CANVASES.

16:57.057 --> 16:58.934
HALO,
YOU WON THE FLASH CHALLENGE.

16:59.017 --> 17:02.438
YOU NOW HAVE THE POWER
TO ASSIGN ALL HUMAN CANVASES.

17:02.521 --> 17:04.982
BE STRATEGIC.

17:05.065 --> 17:07.276
{\an8}- IT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER,
THIS LATE IN THE GAME,

17:07.358 --> 17:09.486
{\an8}TO START AIMING
AT THE STRONGEST ARTISTS.

17:09.569 --> 17:11.530
IN MY MIND, THAT'S SCOTT.

17:11.613 --> 17:12.865
- I WANT A FIERCE SNAKE
WITH BIG FANGS.

17:12.948 --> 17:15.159
- NOW THE SHOTS REALLY MATTER.

17:15.242 --> 17:16.827
- LIKE TO GET A SNAKE
RIGHT HERE.

17:16.910 --> 17:18.078
- RIB TATTOOS HURT.

17:18.162 --> 17:19.454
I NEED TO FIND THE PERSON

17:19.538 --> 17:22.040
THAT CAN'T SIT
THROUGH THIS TATTOO.

17:22.124 --> 17:23.208
WHAT'S THE LONGEST
YOU'VE SAT FOR?

17:23.291 --> 17:24.460
- ABOUT EIGHT HOURS.
- GOOD STUFF.

17:24.542 --> 17:29.048
- I WANT A BADASS SNAKE TATTOO
ON MY LEFT RIB CAGE.

17:29.131 --> 17:31.008
- AND YOU HAVE YOUR OTHER RIBS
DONE TOO, RIGHT?

17:31.091 --> 17:33.051
{\an8}- YES.

17:33.135 --> 17:35.763
- I WANT A COLORED SNAKE
ON MY RIGHT RIB.

17:35.846 --> 17:37.097
- DO YOU HAVE
YOUR OTHER RIBS DONE?

17:37.181 --> 17:38.724
- NOPE.

17:38.807 --> 17:40.476
- DO YOU HAVE
ANY OTHER TATTOOS?

17:40.559 --> 17:41.894
- I HAVE LITTLE TATTOOS.

17:41.977 --> 17:44.730
{\an8}- RIB PIECES ARE
EXTREMELY PAINFUL.

17:44.813 --> 17:46.148
- HERE.

17:46.231 --> 17:48.108
- AND IF YOU ONLY HAVE A COUPLE
LITTLE, TEENY, TINY TATTOOS...

17:48.192 --> 17:49.485
- NERVOUS?
- A LITTLE.

17:49.568 --> 17:51.737
- THEN YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE IN STORE FOR.

17:51.820 --> 17:53.322
- I WOULD LIKE
TO GET A BLACK AND GRAY COBRA

17:53.405 --> 17:54.782
GOING IN AND OUT MY RIBS.

17:54.865 --> 17:56.700
- DID HE SAY GOING
IN AND OUT OF HIS RIBS?

17:58.494 --> 18:00.829
- THAT'LL BE AN AWESOME ONE.

18:04.500 --> 18:07.586
- HALO CRIED LIKE A LITTLE BITCH
WHEN I GAVE HIM A HARD CANVAS.

18:07.669 --> 18:08.420
{\an8}GIVE ME WHATEVER CANVAS
YOU WANT,

18:08.504 --> 18:09.963
{\an8}I'M GONNA TAKE IT LIKE A MAN.

18:10.047 --> 18:11.465
{\an8}- THIS IS FOR YOU.

18:11.548 --> 18:14.885
{\an8}I KNOW I'M GIVING SCOTT ONE
OF THE MOST DIFFICULT CANVASES

18:14.968 --> 18:16.136
{\an8}HE'S PROBABLY EVER
WORKED WITH.

18:16.220 --> 18:17.596
THERE YOU GO.

18:17.679 --> 18:20.140
I HOPE THAT THIS IS THE ONE
THAT KNOCKS SCOTT ON HIS ASS.

18:20.224 --> 18:23.852
- CANVASES, ONE BY ONE,
PLEASE READ THE ARTIST'S NAME

18:23.936 --> 18:25.521
ON THE BOTTOM
OF YOUR SKULL.

18:25.604 --> 18:26.563
- MELISSA.

18:26.647 --> 18:29.525
- HALO.

18:33.570 --> 18:36.198
- SCOTT.

18:36.281 --> 18:36.698
{\an8}- I KNOW HALO IS GUNNING
FOR ME.

18:36.782 --> 18:38.951
{\an8}IT'S KARMA.

18:39.034 --> 18:41.203
I GUESS IT'S MY TURN
TO RISE TO THE CHALLENGE.

18:41.286 --> 18:42.204
BRING IT.

18:42.287 --> 18:43.914
I WILL [bleep] STILL DO
A GOOD JOB.

18:43.997 --> 18:45.207
- MATTI.

18:45.290 --> 18:47.960
- SAUSAGE.

18:48.043 --> 18:50.379
- REMEMBER, GUYS,
AFTER THE ELIMINATION TATTOO,

18:50.462 --> 18:52.673
THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY
WILL VOTE ON THE TATTOO

18:52.756 --> 18:54.049
THAT THEY THINK IS THE WORST

18:54.132 --> 18:56.176
AND PUT ONE ARTIST UP
FOR ELIMINATION.

18:56.260 --> 18:58.178
AND ALSO, THE WINNER
OF TATTOO OF THE DAY

18:58.262 --> 19:00.556
WILL PUT AN ARTIST UP
FOR ELIMINATION.

19:00.639 --> 19:03.934
YOU WILL HAVE SIX HOURS
TO TATTOO A JAPANESE SNAKE

19:04.017 --> 19:06.144
ON YOUR CANVAS' RIBS.

19:06.228 --> 19:10.607
BASED ON YOUR WORK,
ONE OF YOU WILL BE CLOSING SHOP.

19:10.691 --> 19:13.402
GOOD LUCK.

19:13.485 --> 19:16.405
- PROPORTION IS PARTICULARLY
IMPORTANT IN JAPANESE TATTOOING,

19:16.488 --> 19:17.739
{\an8}JUST BECAUSE THERE'S ALWAYS
SO MANY DIFFERENT ELEMENTS.

19:17.823 --> 19:20.117
- SO A COBRA?
- YEAH.

19:20.200 --> 19:21.201
- THESE ELEMENTS NEED TO BE
IN A BELIEVABLE SIZE.

19:21.285 --> 19:23.787
IF SOMETHING'S
OUT OF PROPORTION,

19:23.871 --> 19:25.080
IT'S NOT GONNA BE
A WELL-DONE PIECE.

19:25.163 --> 19:27.416
- SO YOU'D WANT THE MOUTH OPEN?

19:27.499 --> 19:28.876
- DEFINITELY WANT
THE MOUTH OPEN,

19:28.959 --> 19:30.502
AND I LIKE SHARP TEETH.

19:30.586 --> 19:32.337
IT JUST MAKES IT LOOK
MORE VICIOUS.

19:32.421 --> 19:34.673
- THE FACT THAT YOU'VE SAT
FOR EIGHT HOURS BEFORE MAKES ME

19:34.756 --> 19:36.341
FEEL REAL COMFORTABLE
WORKING ON YOU.

19:36.425 --> 19:40.679
- YEAH, ANYONE I'VE DONE WORK
WITH SAYS I SIT LIKE A ROCK.

19:40.762 --> 19:44.308
- I WANT TO START, LIKE,
UNDER MY BOOB

19:44.391 --> 19:45.809
AND END, LIKE, HERE.

19:45.893 --> 19:48.061
- I WOULD RECOMMEND, BEING
THAT YOU'VE NEVER HAD, LIKE,

19:48.145 --> 19:50.272
A REALLY BIG SESSION, A TATTOO
PROBABLY ABOUT THIS BIG.

19:50.355 --> 19:54.443
- MY ONLY CONCERN IS
I WANT SOMETHING SEXY.

19:54.526 --> 19:59.031
I WANT THE SHAPE TO BE
IN HARMONY WITH MY BODY.

19:59.114 --> 20:01.617
{\an8}- MY CANVAS HAS ONLY SAT
THROUGH LITTLE, TINY BANGERS

20:01.700 --> 20:03.452
{\an8}ON REAL EASY PLACES.

20:03.535 --> 20:06.955
SHE WILL NOT SIT
THROUGH A BIG JAPANESE TATTOO.

20:07.039 --> 20:09.041
IT IS NOT GONNA
[bleep] HAPPEN.

20:09.124 --> 20:10.918
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU GOT YOURSELF INTO?

20:11.001 --> 20:12.336
RIBS ARE TOUGH.

20:12.419 --> 20:14.087
HE DEFINITELY THREW YOU AT ME

20:14.171 --> 20:15.631
BECAUSE HE THOUGHT
THAT YOU WOULD TAP OUT.

20:15.714 --> 20:17.466
- BUT, YOU KNOW, I DO WANT
TO HAVE SOMETHING

20:17.549 --> 20:18.258
THAT HAS TO DO WITH MY BODY.

20:18.342 --> 20:20.886
- I HAVE WORKED WAY TOO HARD

20:20.969 --> 20:22.012
THROUGHOUT THIS WHOLE
COMPETITION TO GO HOME

20:22.095 --> 20:24.973
BECAUSE OF THIS STUBBORN CANVAS.

20:25.057 --> 20:28.143
- WHAT IF THE HEAD
IS BITING MY BOOB?

20:28.226 --> 20:31.688
- IF I DON'T GET MY CANVAS
ON BOARD WITH ME, I AM SCREWED.

20:37.569 --> 20:38.737
- WE'VE ALREADY AGREED

20:38.820 --> 20:40.322
THAT THIS IS GONNA BE THE FLOW
OF THE PIECE.

20:40.405 --> 20:41.657
- NOT THIS, RIGHT?

20:41.740 --> 20:43.283
- THE CHALLENGE--
- I DON'T WANT IT TOO CONFUSING.

20:43.367 --> 20:44.826
- MY CANVAS IS BEING
SO DIFFICULT.

20:44.910 --> 20:47.245
YOU GOT TO TRUST ME.

20:47.329 --> 20:49.915
- I'M JUST CONFUSED
OF HOW THIS SNAKE IS TURNING.

20:49.998 --> 20:50.916
- LEAVE IT UP TO ME.

20:50.999 --> 20:52.334
I DO NOT NEED
THIS [bleep] RIGHT NOW.

20:52.417 --> 20:55.796
- IT'S NOT NATURAL.
IT'S WEIRD.

20:55.879 --> 20:56.922
- YOU'RE STILL
NOT TRUSTING ME.

20:57.005 --> 20:59.174
- IT'S AWESOME
TO WATCH SCOTT SQUIRM.

20:59.257 --> 21:01.635
- JUST LEAVE IT.
LET ME DO THIS.

21:01.718 --> 21:03.345
- THE IDEA
THAT HE GETS A TASTE

21:03.428 --> 21:05.347
OF WHAT HE'S BEEN ABLE
TO DISH OUT,

21:05.430 --> 21:07.224
HOW CAN IT NOT BRING A SMILE
TO YOUR FACE?

21:07.307 --> 21:08.433
- YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO ME.

21:08.517 --> 21:09.851
I'M AT THE TOP
IN THIS COMPETITION.

21:09.935 --> 21:11.645
THERE'S A REASON FOR IT.
YOU HAVE TO TRUST ME.

21:11.728 --> 21:12.854
YOU CAN DO THIS--
- YEAH, I KNOW.

21:12.938 --> 21:14.439
BUT WHAT YOU LIKE
IS NOT WHAT I LIKE.

21:14.523 --> 21:16.108
- NO, BUT I KNOW
WHAT YOU LIKE.

21:16.191 --> 21:17.985
AND IF YOU DON'T LET ME DO THAT,
THEN YOU'RE GONNA BE UPSET,

21:18.068 --> 21:19.278
AND YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
A BAD TATTOO.

21:19.361 --> 21:20.529
AND YOU'RE ONLY GONNA BE
BEATING YOURSELF IN THE ASS

21:20.612 --> 21:22.489
FOR RESTRICTING ME
AND TWISTING MY ARM

21:22.572 --> 21:23.699
AND MAKING IT DO IT YOUR WAY,
YOU KNOW?

21:23.782 --> 21:28.286
- SURE.

21:28.370 --> 21:29.997
- YOU HAVE SIX HOURS
TO TATTOO A JAPANESE SNAKE

21:30.080 --> 21:33.000
ON YOUR CANVAS' RIBS.

21:33.083 --> 21:36.878
AND YOUR TIME BEGINS NOW.

21:36.962 --> 21:39.047
- LET ME GET TO TOWN.

21:39.131 --> 21:40.048
- LET'S DO IT.

21:40.132 --> 21:41.091
- GET YOU ALL STENCILED UP.

21:41.174 --> 21:42.592
- IN THIS ELIMINATION TATTOO,

21:42.676 --> 21:45.721
{\an8}PROPORTION IS IMPORTANT
BECAUSE WE'RE ASKING THEM

21:45.804 --> 21:46.930
{\an8}TO TATTOO A SNAKE,

21:47.014 --> 21:49.516
WHICH IS RECOGNIZABLE IMAGERY
TO EVERYBODY.

21:49.599 --> 21:51.059
AND WE'RE ASKING 'EM TO DO IT
IN A JAPANESE STYLE.

21:51.143 --> 21:54.062
WE'RE ASKING THEM TO INCORPORATE
SOMETHING WITH THE SNAKE

21:54.146 --> 21:55.564
TO REALLY SHOW IT
IN PROPORTION.

21:55.647 --> 21:56.606
- PRETTY COOL?
- YEAH.

21:56.690 --> 21:58.942
- IT'S GONNA BE
A BEAUTIFUL TATTOO.

21:59.026 --> 21:59.901
- I LOVE IT.

21:59.985 --> 22:01.528
- MY ONLY CONCERN IS,
YOU KNOW,

22:01.611 --> 22:02.946
OBVIOUSLY,
JUST SITTING THROUGH IT.

22:03.030 --> 22:06.908
IF YOU GET DIZZY OR IF YOU'RE
FEELING, LIKE, COLD SWEATS

22:06.992 --> 22:08.076
OR YOU'RE FEELING NAUSEOUS
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT,

22:08.160 --> 22:10.120
THEN WE'LL PUMP THE BRAKES
A LITTLE BIT.

22:10.203 --> 22:12.622
{\an8}I AM REALLY WORRIED
THAT MY CANVAS IS GONNA TAP OUT.

22:12.706 --> 22:14.499
- BUT, YOU KNOW, IF I'M IN PAIN,
I'LL TAKE A BREAK.

22:14.583 --> 22:16.084
- YOU DON'T WANT
TO TAKE A BREAK,

22:16.168 --> 22:17.461
BECAUSE WHEN YOU COME BACK,
IT'LL HURT TEN TIMES MORE.

22:17.544 --> 22:19.713
- [laughs] I'M GONNA TAKE
ONE BREAK--COUPLE OF BREAKS.

22:19.796 --> 22:21.214
- YOU DON'T WANT
TO TAKE A COUPLE BREAKS.

22:21.298 --> 22:23.759
ONCE YOU BREAK ONCE OR TWICE,
YOU'RE TAPPING OUT.

22:23.842 --> 22:25.302
I'M STRESSING THE [bleep] OUT
RIGHT NOW.

22:25.385 --> 22:26.470
YOU GOT YOUR JOB TO DO,
AND I GOT MY JOB TO DO.

22:26.553 --> 22:28.472
NOW IT'S JUST UP TO ME
TO EXECUTE THAT,

22:28.555 --> 22:32.309
AND IT'S UP TO YOU
TO SIT THROUGH IT.

22:35.395 --> 22:38.607
- I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH ANY OF
THE RULES OF JAPANESE TRADITION.

22:38.690 --> 22:39.649
{\an8}I'M JUST GONNA TRY TO FOLLOW

22:39.733 --> 22:41.693
{\an8}AS MUCH REFERENCE
AS I POSSIBLY CAN.

22:41.777 --> 22:43.361
KNOWING THAT
WE'RE THE TOP FIVE,

22:43.445 --> 22:45.781
THERE'S DEFINITELY NO ROOM
FOR ERROR IN THIS TATTOO.

22:45.864 --> 22:47.282
- WHAT'S GOING ON
IN HERE, GUYS?

22:47.365 --> 22:49.284
THIS THING GONNA
BE COLOR TOO?

22:49.367 --> 22:51.328
- YEAH.
NICE, SIMPLE COLOR.

22:51.411 --> 22:53.830
- HALO IS BITING OFF
WAY MORE THAN HE CAN CHEW.

22:53.914 --> 22:55.624
HIS BACKGROUND'S WAY OFF,

22:55.707 --> 22:58.126
AND HE'S DOING THE BELLY
BACKWARDS IN A SECTION.

22:58.210 --> 22:59.461
NOT A GOOD ONE.

22:59.544 --> 23:00.796
- THAT'S A LARGER PIECE
THAN I WOULD'VE TRIED TO DO

23:00.879 --> 23:02.089
IN SIX HOURS.

23:02.172 --> 23:04.049
- FOUR HOURS TO GO.
FOUR MORE HOURS.

23:15.644 --> 23:17.979
- I'M REALLY EXCITED
ABOUT THIS ELIMINATION TATTOO.

23:18.063 --> 23:21.191
{\an8}I GET A CHANCE TO DO A REALLY
BIG, BALLSY, BADASS SNAKE.

23:21.274 --> 23:24.111
THIS IS A BIG TATTOO TO COLOR IN
IN A FEW HOURS.

23:24.194 --> 23:25.946
HANGING IN THERE?
- I'M GOOD.

23:26.029 --> 23:28.990
- I PLAN TO SHOW PROPORTION
WITH THE RELATION OF THE SIZE

23:29.074 --> 23:30.534
OF THE FLOWERS
TO THE SIZE OF THE SNAKE

23:30.617 --> 23:33.745
AND THE SIZE OF THE SNAKE'S HEAD
TO THE SIZE OF THE SNAKE'S BODY.

23:33.829 --> 23:36.331
- GODDAMN,
LOOK HOW BIG THAT IS.

23:36.414 --> 23:40.544
- I SEE A BIG OPPORTUNITY
FOR ME TO TAKE THIS.

23:40.627 --> 23:42.712
- SAUSAGE, WERE YOU STRUGGLING
WITH THE FACT

23:42.796 --> 23:45.006
THAT IT WAS A COBRA
AND KEEPING IT JAPANESE?

23:45.090 --> 23:46.550
- YEAH, IT'S BEEN
REALLY DIFFICULT.

23:46.633 --> 23:49.594
I WAS HOPING TO PUT,
LIKE, FLOWERS OR LEAVES

23:49.678 --> 23:52.848
OR STUFF LIKE THAT,
AND HE'S JUST NOT GAME FOR IT.

23:52.931 --> 23:53.849
THERE'S NO PRIZE
FOR FIFTH PLACE.

23:53.932 --> 23:56.685
{\an8}THE ONLY PRIZE IS
THE TITLE OF INK MASTER.

23:56.768 --> 23:59.020
- THE SKULL IS
AN INTERESTING CHOICE.

23:59.104 --> 24:00.647
- ON A LOT OF THE RESEARCH
THAT I WAS DOING,

24:00.730 --> 24:03.275
THERE'S A LOT
OF SNAKES AND SKULLS.

24:03.358 --> 24:04.943
I'VE WORKED SO HARD
TO GET THIS FAR.

24:05.026 --> 24:07.028
I NEED TO WIN THIS.

24:07.112 --> 24:08.405
IF THE SNAKE CAN GO
WITH A SKULL,

24:08.488 --> 24:11.241
THEN I'M GONNA PUT A COBRA
WITH A SKULL.

24:11.324 --> 24:13.618
- TWO MORE HOURS.
TWO MORE HOURS.

24:22.502 --> 24:24.129
- EVERY TIME YOU TAKE A BREAK,
IT SLOWS DOWN,

24:24.212 --> 24:26.131
AND YOU COME BACK, AND YOU
CAN'T TAKE THE PAIN THEN.

24:26.214 --> 24:27.215
TRUST ME.

24:27.299 --> 24:29.050
MY CANVAS IS HAVING
A REALLY HARD TIME,

24:29.134 --> 24:30.343
AND SHE'S MAKING IT VOCAL.

24:30.427 --> 24:32.554
I NEED YOUR CONFIDENCE HIGH,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

24:32.637 --> 24:33.763
WE'RE GONNA DO IT.
- [sighs]

24:33.847 --> 24:35.724
- I'M DOING WHATEVER IT TAKES
TO MAKE SURE

24:35.807 --> 24:39.686
THAT I PUT A GOOD TATTOO
IN FRONT OF THOSE JUDGES TODAY.

24:39.769 --> 24:41.146
I JUST DON'T WANT
TO LET YOU GO,

24:41.229 --> 24:42.564
AND THEN I GOT TO DRAG YOU
BACK IN HERE BY YOUR HAIR.

24:42.647 --> 24:44.232
DON'T THINK I WON'T
FOR 100 GRAND.

24:44.316 --> 24:46.735
IF I HAVE TO PHYSICALLY
HOLD MY CANVAS DOWN

24:46.818 --> 24:50.739
TO MAKE SURE SHE DOESN'T LEAVE,
I'M GOING TO DO JUST THAT.

24:50.822 --> 24:51.865
CAN'T MOVE IN THE MIDDLE
OF A LINE LIKE THAT, OKAY?

24:51.948 --> 24:53.241
- SORRY, SORRY,
SORRY, SORRY.

24:53.325 --> 24:55.577
OH,<i> DIOS.</i>

24:55.660 --> 24:58.622
- NUNEZ DOESN'T PUT COLOR
IN HIS TEETH,

24:58.705 --> 25:00.582
SO WE'RE NOT GONNA
PUT COLOR IN OURS.

25:00.665 --> 25:04.961
TRADITIONAL JAPANESE TATTOOING
IS A VERY PRECISE ART.

25:05.045 --> 25:08.089
{\an8}I'M JUST TRYING TO REALLY STICK
TO THE TRADITIONAL RULES TODAY.

25:08.173 --> 25:09.674
- HOW'D YOU DECIDE TO DO THAT
KIND OF A PATTERN ON THE SNAKE?

25:09.758 --> 25:12.886
- I'M LOOKING AT YOUR STUFF
AND HIS STUFF.

25:12.969 --> 25:15.513
I DON'T KNOW MUCH
ABOUT TRADITIONAL JAPANESE,

25:15.597 --> 25:17.682
SO I JUST DID
A BUNCH OF RESEARCH.

25:17.766 --> 25:20.310
THERE'S ONLY FIVE PEOPLE LEFT
IN THIS COMPETITION NOW.

25:20.393 --> 25:21.144
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
TO TRY TO OUTPERFORM

25:21.228 --> 25:23.855
EVERYONE IN THE ROOM.

25:23.939 --> 25:25.899
- TEN MORE MINUTES.

25:33.365 --> 25:35.742
{\an8}- JUST BE STILL.

25:37.619 --> 25:39.788
- MY BODY'S STARTING TO SHAKE.

25:39.871 --> 25:41.581
- YOU SIGNED UP FOR IT.

25:41.665 --> 25:43.458
- TEN, NINE,

25:43.541 --> 25:45.502
EIGHT, SEVEN,

25:45.585 --> 25:47.837
SIX, FIVE,

25:47.921 --> 25:48.964
FOUR, THREE,

25:49.047 --> 25:51.967
TWO, ONE.

25:52.050 --> 25:53.635
THAT IS IT.
MACHINES DOWN.

25:53.718 --> 25:57.222
TIME IS UP.
NO MORE INK.

25:57.305 --> 26:00.475
- OH, THAT IS NICE.

26:00.558 --> 26:01.476
- WOW.

26:01.559 --> 26:02.060
I [bleep] LOVE IT.

26:02.143 --> 26:04.854
- YEAH, DUDE.

26:04.938 --> 26:06.648
- [bleep], RIGHT?

26:06.731 --> 26:08.358
- I DID IT.
I DID IT.

26:08.441 --> 26:10.402
- YEAH, YOU DID IT.
- [laughs]

26:10.485 --> 26:12.862
- GOOD JOB.

26:12.946 --> 26:15.073
- THIS DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
A TATTOO THAT SCOTT WOULD DO.

26:15.156 --> 26:16.658
IT'S UGLY.

26:16.741 --> 26:18.493
IT FEELS GOOD TO KNOW
THAT I'M THE FIRST PERSON

26:18.576 --> 26:22.664
TO KNOCK SCOTT MARSHALL
OFF HIS THRONE.

26:22.747 --> 26:23.999
{\an8}- I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE ON THE TOP.

26:24.082 --> 26:26.835
{\an8}- BULL[bleep].
IT'S A [bleep] DAMN GOOD TATTOO.

26:26.918 --> 26:28.003
{\an8}- [raspberries]

26:28.086 --> 26:29.671
{\an8}- EVERYBODY'S GONNA GET
A ROUGH CRITIQUE TODAY.

26:29.754 --> 26:32.048
{\an8}- IT'S INSULTING,
AND IT'S UTTERLY INCORRECT.

26:32.132 --> 26:32.799
{\an8}- YOU TOTALLY LOST IT.

26:38.596 --> 26:39.597
- WHAT'S UP?

26:39.681 --> 26:40.640
WHAT'S UP, GUYS?

26:40.724 --> 26:43.184
- MAN, YOU THREW ME A DOOZY,
DUDE.

26:43.268 --> 26:45.520
- HOW'D THAT FEEL?
- IT WAS BRUTAL.

26:45.603 --> 26:46.396
- DOESN'T FEEL GOOD, DOES IT?

26:46.479 --> 26:48.815
- SHE WAS VERY DIFFICULT,

26:48.898 --> 26:51.693
AND IT WAS HARD TO GET HER
TO COMPROMISE AT ALL.

26:51.776 --> 26:54.070
BUT I TURNED IT AROUND.

26:54.154 --> 26:55.947
I'M CONFIDENT
ABOUT MY PIECE.

26:56.031 --> 26:58.658
I'M FEELING LIKE HALO'S
GONNA GET BEAT UP THE MOST

26:58.742 --> 26:59.951
ON THIS ONE
AND MAYBE GO HOME.

27:00.035 --> 27:01.536
- NAH.

27:01.619 --> 27:03.580
- I SAW MORE PROBLEMS
IN HALO'S TATTOO THAN YOURS.

27:03.663 --> 27:04.748
[whistles]

27:04.831 --> 27:07.250
YOU MIGHT PASS
ONE OF THESE GUYS UP TODAY.

27:07.334 --> 27:09.252
- DUDE, HALO'S NAILED IT.
MATTI NAILED IT.

27:09.336 --> 27:10.086
- BUT I FEEL LIKE I MIGHT BE
ON THE TOP WITH THIS ONE,

27:10.170 --> 27:12.213
AND I THINK--

27:12.297 --> 27:12.839
- I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE ON THE TOP.

27:12.922 --> 27:14.716
YOURS IS JUST WEIRD.

27:14.799 --> 27:16.426
- BULL[bleep].

27:16.509 --> 27:18.345
{\an8}- SCOTT CAN FART
AND THINK THAT HE WINS.

27:18.428 --> 27:21.264
HE CANNOT LIVE WITH THE FACT
THAT HE DID SOMETHING

27:21.348 --> 27:23.058
THAT WILL SEND HIS ASS
TO THE BOTTOM.

27:23.141 --> 27:24.934
- IT'S A [bleep] DAMN
GOOD TATTOO...

27:25.018 --> 27:25.894
- [raspberries]
- AND THAT'S THAT.

27:25.977 --> 27:28.855
- I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T SEE IT.

27:43.912 --> 27:46.915
- TODAY YOU HAD TO SHOW
YOUR MASTERY OF PROPORTION

27:46.998 --> 27:51.628
BY TATTOOING A JAPANESE SNAKE
ON YOUR CANVAS' RIBS.

27:51.711 --> 27:53.922
- WELL, FIRST OF ALL, I WANT TO
SAY THIS IS A VERY TRICKY DAY.

27:54.005 --> 27:56.257
I APPRECIATE THE HARD WORK
EVERYBODY'S DONE SO FAR,

27:56.341 --> 27:58.093
BUT WE'VE MADE IT TO THE POINT
IN THIS COMPETITION,

27:58.176 --> 27:59.469
WE GOT FIVE PEOPLE LEFT.

27:59.552 --> 28:01.679
WE GOT TO LOOK AT EVERYTHING
ACROSS THE BOARD,

28:01.763 --> 28:04.265
DETAIL FOR DETAIL,
AND FIGURE OUT WHICH FOUR OF YOU

28:04.349 --> 28:06.351
ARE STILL GONNA
BE HERE TOMORROW.

28:06.434 --> 28:08.686
SO EVERYBODY'S GONNA GET
A ROUGH CRITIQUE TODAY.

28:12.857 --> 28:16.820
- MELISSA,
LET'S START WITH YOU.

28:16.903 --> 28:19.447
- YOU DO HAVE SOME ELEMENTS
IN THIS TATTOO

28:19.531 --> 28:21.449
THAT FOLLOW A JAPANESE STYLE.

28:21.533 --> 28:23.743
SOME OF THE TATTOOS
WE SAW TODAY DID NOT.

28:23.827 --> 28:26.079
SO FOLLOWING THAT PART
OF THE CHALLENGE, YOU TRIED,

28:26.162 --> 28:27.122
AND YOU HAD
A PRETTY GOOD SWING AT IT.

28:27.205 --> 28:29.332
MY PROBLEM
WITH THE PROPORTION IS THE SIZE

28:29.416 --> 28:30.333
OF THE SNAKE HEAD.

28:30.417 --> 28:31.793
IT LOOKS TOO BIG.

28:31.876 --> 28:33.962
AND YOUR SHAPE OF THE BODY,
IT'S NOT A LOT OF SMOOTH CURVES.

28:34.045 --> 28:36.005
IT HAS A LITTLE BIT
OF A WONKY LOOK TO IT.

28:36.089 --> 28:37.799
IT IS PRETTY--

28:37.882 --> 28:38.800
- THERE'S A FEW RULES
THAT WOULD APPLY HERE.

28:38.883 --> 28:40.969
LIKE, IF YOU LOOK
AT THE LOWER JAW,

28:41.052 --> 28:42.512
IT RUNS
ALONGSIDE THE UNDERBELLY.

28:42.595 --> 28:43.847
THAT'S GETTING LOST
RIGHT THERE.

28:43.930 --> 28:45.056
IF YOU'D MOVED IT UP,
THERE WOULD'VE BEEN

28:45.140 --> 28:46.266
A LITTLE BIT
OF A SEPARATION.

28:46.349 --> 28:48.643
ALSO, YOUR LEAF GOES
RIGHT TO THE BACK.

28:48.726 --> 28:50.562
YOU SHOULD NEVER HAVE LINES
TOUCHING LIKE THAT.

28:50.645 --> 28:51.980
JUST LITTLE THINGS
LIKE THAT, I THINK,

28:52.063 --> 28:53.440
WOULD HELP YOUR WORK
LOOK A LOT BETTER.

28:53.523 --> 28:54.649
- YOU DON'T HAVE THIS WAY

28:54.732 --> 28:56.985
OF MAKING YOUR DRAWINGS
FLOW NICELY.

28:57.068 --> 28:58.611
IT'S NOT THAT
YOU'RE A BAD ARTIST,

28:58.695 --> 29:00.405
YOU JUST DO THINGS VERY STIFF.

29:00.488 --> 29:02.866
YOU GOT TO FIND YOUR FLOW.

29:04.284 --> 29:08.121
- MATTI.

29:08.204 --> 29:11.833
- AS FAR AS PROPORTION GOES,
I REALLY LIKE NOT ONLY

29:11.916 --> 29:13.084
THE PROPORTION OF THE SNAKE
TO THE FLOWERS,

29:13.168 --> 29:15.503
BUT ALSO JUST THE PROPORTION
OF THE SNAKE ITSELF,

29:15.587 --> 29:17.672
THE LENGTH VERSUS THE HEAD.

29:17.755 --> 29:19.841
I LIKE THE WAY
IT FITS THE BODY.

29:19.924 --> 29:21.634
- LOOKING
AT THIS MUCH TATTOOING,

29:21.718 --> 29:24.262
IT'S DEFINITELY IMPRESSIVE
THAT THE AMOUNT OF COVERAGE

29:24.345 --> 29:26.681
THAT YOU GOT AND THE PROFICIENCY
THAT YOU HAVE,

29:26.764 --> 29:27.974
DOING WHAT YOU DO.

29:28.057 --> 29:29.184
REALLY A NICE JOB.

29:29.267 --> 29:30.643
- I THINK THERE'S DESIGN FLAWS,

29:30.727 --> 29:31.978
BUT OVERALL,
IT'S WELL-BALANCED,

29:32.061 --> 29:33.021
IT'S WELL-PROPORTIONED.

29:33.104 --> 29:34.022
GOOD ART IS GOOD ART

29:34.105 --> 29:35.523
IN ANY CULTURE.
- YEAH.

29:35.607 --> 29:36.691
- YOU WANT GOOD FLOW, YOU WANT
GOOD PLACEMENT, GOOD PROPORTION.

29:36.774 --> 29:37.901
- MM-HMM.

29:37.984 --> 29:39.068
- I THINK YOU PULLED THAT OFF
WITH THIS ONE.

29:39.152 --> 29:41.321
- THANK YOU.

29:42.822 --> 29:45.366
- SAUSAGE.

29:45.450 --> 29:48.161
- I THINK YOUR BIG SHORTCOMING
IS PROPORTION.

29:48.244 --> 29:49.412
THE SKULL IS
JUST REALLY SMALL.

29:49.496 --> 29:52.040
IF I COULD BELIEVE THAT
THIS SNAKE WAS REALLY COILING

29:52.123 --> 29:55.126
INTO A SKULL, IT WOULD MAKE
THE SNAKE A LOT MORE DYNAMIC.

29:55.210 --> 29:56.878
- IF I WOULD'VE MADE
THE SKULL ANY BIGGER,

29:56.961 --> 29:57.921
IT WOULD'VE TAKEN AWAY
FROM THE COBRA ITSELF.

29:58.004 --> 30:00.215
- YOU COULD'VE DONE
THE SAME SNAKE

30:00.298 --> 30:01.466
WRAPPED AROUND A BIGGER SKULL,

30:01.549 --> 30:02.717
AND THE SNAKE
STILL WOULD'VE BEEN THE HERO.

30:02.800 --> 30:05.637
AS FAR AS THE BACKGROUND,
I LIKE THE SOFT,

30:05.720 --> 30:07.597
SUBTLE LITTLE BIT
OF BACKGROUND.

30:07.680 --> 30:09.933
YOU DIDN'T JUST TAKE A BIG SPOT
OUT OF HIS RIBS.

30:10.016 --> 30:11.351
YOU KIND OF PUT SOMETHING
THAT FIT.

30:11.434 --> 30:13.728
THE BACKGROUND BEING NICE
AND SUBTLE LIKE THAT,

30:13.811 --> 30:14.896
I THINK, HELPED YOU OUT.

30:19.400 --> 30:21.069
- HALO.

30:21.152 --> 30:24.489
- WHAT MADE YOU DECIDE TO JUST
DO THE BOTTOM JUST FLAT ACROSS?

30:24.572 --> 30:26.533
- I HAVE NO BACKGROUND
IN JAPANESE TRADITIONAL.

30:26.616 --> 30:27.575
I JUST DIDN'T KNOW
HOW TO END IT.

30:27.659 --> 30:29.452
- THAT PART OF THE LAYOUT
IS VERY AWKWARD.

30:29.536 --> 30:30.537
FLAT ACROSS THE BOTTOM,

30:30.620 --> 30:33.623
BIG, OVAL TOMBSTONE SHAPE
AT THE TOP.

30:33.706 --> 30:34.874
- THIS DOES LOOK LIKE
A TOMBSTONE.

30:34.958 --> 30:37.168
IT ALSO LOOKS LIKE
IT WOULD FIT BETTER ON AN ARM.

30:37.252 --> 30:39.671
I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS
NOT YOUR AREA OF EXPERTISE.

30:39.754 --> 30:41.756
UNFORTUNATELY, IT SHOWS.

30:41.839 --> 30:44.467
- YOU SHOULD'VE TAKEN ANOTHER
TWO HOURS JUST ON THE DRAWING

30:44.551 --> 30:45.593
AND DONE LESS TATTOOING,

30:45.677 --> 30:47.762
BECAUSE THE SNAKE BODY
MAKES ZERO SENSE.

30:47.845 --> 30:50.890
THE BELLY OF THE SNAKE IS GOING
IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION

30:50.974 --> 30:52.100
THAT IT SHOULD GO.

30:52.183 --> 30:54.477
THE BELLY IS GOING UPWARDS,
NOT DOWNWARDS.

30:54.561 --> 30:56.563
- NOT ONLY IS THIS JAPANESE
TODAY, BUT IT'S JUST A SNAKE.

30:56.646 --> 30:59.566
AND JUST TO SEE SO MANY FLAWS
JUST IN THE SHAPE OF THE SNAKE,

30:59.649 --> 31:01.693
THERE'S NO REASON FOR THAT.

31:01.776 --> 31:03.945
- IT'S JUST WAY OFF, WAY OFF.

31:07.323 --> 31:09.826
- SCOTT.

31:09.909 --> 31:12.829
- ALL RIGHT, SCOTT,
VERY, VERY SURPRISED

31:12.912 --> 31:14.122
TO SEE THIS TATTOO
COME OUT OF YOU.

31:14.205 --> 31:15.999
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS THING
FROM ACROSS THE ROOM,

31:16.082 --> 31:19.961
COMPARED TO THE OTHER TATTOOS,
THIS IS THE ONE

31:20.044 --> 31:21.421
THAT'S HARD TO TELL
WHAT THE [bleep]'S GOING ON.

31:21.504 --> 31:22.672
- I DON'T LIKE THE LAYOUT.

31:22.755 --> 31:24.924
I DON'T LIKE THE WAY
IT SITS ON HER BODY.

31:25.008 --> 31:27.468
THE WAY YOU DECIDED TO MAKE
THIS BACKGROUND SWOOP

31:27.552 --> 31:29.012
ECHO THE SHAPE OF THAT SNAKE

31:29.095 --> 31:30.722
MAKES IT HARD TO TELL
WHAT'S GOING ON.

31:30.805 --> 31:33.600
AND AS FAR AS HITTING JAPANESE,
YOU TOTALLY LOST IT.

31:33.683 --> 31:34.892
- I DID GET
A LITTLE NEW SCHOOL WITH IT.

31:34.976 --> 31:36.060
BUT WHEN I'M FREEHAND DRAWING,
I CAN'T HELP IT.

31:36.144 --> 31:38.271
MY STYLE'S GONNA COME OUT
IN MY DRAWING.

31:38.354 --> 31:40.398
- ONE OF THE THINGS
ABOUT JAPANESE TATTOOING IS

31:40.481 --> 31:41.733
IT'S NOT NECESSARILY
ALWAYS ABOUT YOU.

31:41.816 --> 31:44.402
IT'S PART OF A LARGER HISTORY,
A LARGER CULTURE.

31:44.485 --> 31:45.486
SO WALKING IN AND BEING LIKE,
"I'M DOING IT MY WAY,"

31:45.570 --> 31:47.530
IT'S INSULTING.

31:47.614 --> 31:48.740
IT'S UTTERLY INCORRECT.

31:48.823 --> 31:50.074
- SHE WAS A TOUGH CANVAS, MAN.

31:50.158 --> 31:52.035
- HER BEING A TOUGH CANVAS
ASIDE,

31:52.118 --> 31:53.536
YOUR DRAWING'S YOUR DRAWING.

31:53.620 --> 31:55.246
SHE'S A TOUGH CANVAS,
IT'S GONNA SHOW EVEN MORE

31:55.330 --> 31:56.956
IN YOUR APPLICATION,
WHICH IT DOESN'T.

31:57.040 --> 31:58.833
IT'S JUST ODD.
IT'S AN ODD DRAWING, MAN.

31:58.916 --> 32:01.753
- I'M NOT MAKING EXCUSES.

32:01.836 --> 32:03.004
YOU KNOW, I'M GONNA STAND
BEHIND THIS PIECE.

32:03.087 --> 32:05.798
- IT'S DEFINITELY
MY LEAST FAVORITE TODAY.

32:05.882 --> 32:08.009
IT'S APPLIED METICULOUSLY,
WHICH MAKES IT TOUGH, MAN.

32:08.092 --> 32:11.929
IT'S A CRAZY THING,
THIS COMPETITION.

32:15.224 --> 32:18.186
- THE JUDGES HAVE
DETERMINED A WINNER.

32:18.269 --> 32:22.315
THE BEST TATTOO
OF THE DAY...

32:22.398 --> 32:24.108
GOES TO MATTI.

32:24.192 --> 32:25.234
[applause]

32:25.318 --> 32:26.611
- THANK YOU.

32:26.694 --> 32:27.570
- THE PROPORTION YOU SHOWED
IN THIS TATTOO

32:27.654 --> 32:29.739
AND THE SIMPLE LAYOUT OF IT

32:29.822 --> 32:31.157
IS WHAT, COLLECTIVELY,
WE ALL LIKED.

32:31.240 --> 32:34.786
AND YOU DEFINITELY STOOD OUT
FOR COMPOSITION.

32:34.869 --> 32:36.287
- CONGRATULATIONS, MATTI.

32:36.371 --> 32:38.873
YOU HAVE THE POWER TO CHOOSE
THE ARTIST THAT YOU THINK

32:38.956 --> 32:42.919
HAS THE WORST TATTOO
AND PUT THEM UP FOR ELIMINATION.

32:43.002 --> 32:45.838
THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY IS
ALSO DELIBERATING RIGHT NOW.

32:45.922 --> 32:47.715
THEIR VOTE WILL PUT ANOTHER
ARTIST UP FOR ELIMINATION.

32:47.799 --> 32:49.967
HEAD BACK TO THE LOFT,

32:50.051 --> 32:52.762
AND WE'LL CALL YOU
WHEN WE HAVE A DECISION.

32:58.267 --> 32:59.602
- GOOD JOB, DUDE.
- THANK YOU, APPRECIATE IT.

32:59.686 --> 33:02.689
- WELL, THAT WAS DEFINITELY
THE WORST CRITIQUE I'VE GOTTEN.

33:02.772 --> 33:03.898
- YOU KNOW YOU'RE SAFE, DUDE.

33:03.981 --> 33:05.566
I'M NOT GONNA SEND YOU
DOWN THERE.

33:05.650 --> 33:07.485
- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO, DUDE?
- I DON'T KNOW.

33:07.568 --> 33:09.070
I'M LOOKING AT HALO
AND SAUSAGE RIGHT NOW

33:09.153 --> 33:10.446
AND TRYING TO FLIP-FLOP BETWEEN.

33:10.530 --> 33:11.781
- I THINK YOU SHOULD PUT
SAUSAGE DOWN THERE, MAN.

33:11.864 --> 33:14.492
YOU KNOW HOW WE'VE BEEN
WORKING ON BREAKING HIM DOWN?

33:14.575 --> 33:16.035
HE'S AT HIS WEAKEST POINT NOW.

33:16.119 --> 33:17.912
GIVE HIM THE KILL MOVE, YOU
CAN GET RID OF HIM RIGHT NOW,

33:17.995 --> 33:19.205
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
- MM-HMM. YOU KNOW WHAT?

33:19.288 --> 33:20.707
I'M THINKING SEND HALO DOWN,
JUST BECAUSE HE--

33:20.790 --> 33:23.459
HE WINS FLASH CHALLENGES, DUDE.

33:23.543 --> 33:25.920
HE GETS SKULL PICKS.
SAUSAGE DOESN'T.

33:26.003 --> 33:27.547
- YEAH, I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN.

33:27.630 --> 33:29.173
{\an8}- HALO SHOWED HOW AGGRESSIVE
HE'S GONNA PLAY THIS GAME

33:29.257 --> 33:32.093
{\an8}FROM NOW ON BY GOING RIGHT
AFTER THE PERSON ON TOP.

33:32.176 --> 33:35.805
- STRATEGICALLY, DUDE,
I WOULD PICK HALO.

33:35.888 --> 33:37.265
IT'S GONNA BENEFIT
BOTH OF US.

33:37.348 --> 33:39.100
- HALO SHOULDN'T HAVE
MESSED WITH SCOTT

33:39.183 --> 33:41.352
BECAUSE SCOTT'S MY BOY
AND HE'S ON MY SIDE.

33:41.436 --> 33:44.522
- DUDE, IF YOU'D SEND HALO,
YOU'RE IN, DUDE.

33:44.605 --> 33:47.567
YOU'RE IN THE [bleep] TOP
RIGHT THERE.

33:54.824 --> 33:57.702
- ALL RIGHT, TRADITIONAL
JAPANESE SNAKES ON THE RIBS.

33:57.785 --> 33:59.871
HOW'D THEY DO OVERALL?

33:59.954 --> 34:01.289
- LOOKING
AT THE PROPORTION CHALLENGE,

34:01.372 --> 34:02.623
A COUPLE PEOPLE
HIT THE MARK.

34:02.707 --> 34:03.666
BUT LOOKING AT THIS
AS A JAPANESE CHALLENGE,

34:03.750 --> 34:06.461
MOST PEOPLE FAILED.

34:06.544 --> 34:07.628
- LET'S TALK ABOUT HALO'S PIECE.

34:07.712 --> 34:11.090
- I LITERALLY HATE
THIS BIG TOMBSTONE BORDER.

34:11.174 --> 34:13.259
FROM A DISTANCE,
IT IS A BIG, HUGE SPOT.

34:13.342 --> 34:15.594
- WHEN PEOPLE THINK
JAPANESE TATTOOING,

34:15.678 --> 34:16.596
THEY THINK THIS STYLE

34:16.679 --> 34:17.638
THAT WAS MADE UP
HUNDREDS OF YEARS AGO

34:17.722 --> 34:19.514
THAT REALLY WORKS WELL
WITH THE BODY,

34:19.599 --> 34:21.016
AND WHAT HE DID DIDN'T.

34:21.100 --> 34:23.268
- NEXT UP, WE HAVE SAUSAGE.

34:23.351 --> 34:24.896
- THE DYNAMICS IN THIS TATTOO
ARE LOST

34:24.978 --> 34:26.773
BECAUSE THE PROPORTION
IS WAY OFF.

34:26.856 --> 34:30.525
- THE PROPORTIONS OF THE SNAKE
TO THE SKULL ARE A LITTLE WEIRD,

34:30.610 --> 34:32.612
BUT IT'S PROBABLY THE BEST ONE
PLACED ON THE BODY.

34:32.695 --> 34:33.905
- IF YOU LOOK AT SCOTT'S TATTOO,

34:33.987 --> 34:36.532
I DON'T CARE WHAT DAY
THE CHALLENGE IS,

34:36.616 --> 34:38.117
IT'S JUST AN UNAPPEALING TATTOO.

34:38.201 --> 34:39.952
- HE PUT A COUPLE
JAPANESE ELEMENTS IN THIS,

34:40.036 --> 34:41.245
BUT THEY'RE JUST BAD.

34:41.329 --> 34:43.873
THE FINGER WAVES ARE SIMPLY UGLY
AND TERRIBLY DONE.

34:43.956 --> 34:45.458
- THIS THING
IS A COMPLETE NIGHTMARE.

34:45.541 --> 34:48.835
- SO IT'S OBVIOUSLY BETWEEN
SCOTT, FOR THE FIRST TIME,

34:48.920 --> 34:51.714
AND MELISSA, WHO HAS
THE WORST TATTOO OF THE DAY.

34:51.797 --> 34:53.966
- MELISSA JUST TOTALLY
DEVASTATED

34:54.050 --> 34:55.176
HER PROPORTION WITH THE...
- ENORMOUS HEAD.

34:55.259 --> 34:57.553
- SILLY-LOOKING HEAD
ON THE SIZE OF THE SNAKE.

34:57.637 --> 34:58.679
- IT'S A BIG RED "S."

34:58.763 --> 35:00.389
WHEN I LOOK AT THAT TATTOO
ACROSS THE ROOM,

35:00.473 --> 35:01.974
ALL I SEE IS A RED "S."
- YEAH.

35:02.058 --> 35:04.352
- BUT I HAVE TO SAY,
I LIKE THAT SHE'S HIT

35:04.435 --> 35:05.728
THE JAPANESE CHALLENGE
BETTER THAN SCOTT'S TATTOO.

35:05.812 --> 35:08.439
A VERY TOUGH DECISION.

35:08.523 --> 35:09.524
IT'S GONNA BE INTERESTING
TO SEE

35:09.607 --> 35:11.067
HOW THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY VOTES,

35:11.150 --> 35:12.693
AND I'M ALSO REALLY CURIOUS
TO SEE

35:12.777 --> 35:14.278
WHO MATTI BRINGS DOWN HERE.

35:14.362 --> 35:18.032
{\an8}- IF I WAS HIM, I'D BE PROBABLY
GUNNING FOR THE TOP.

35:18.115 --> 35:19.325
{\an8}- WE ARE HERE TO DETERMINE

35:19.408 --> 35:20.493
{\an8}WHO HAS THE WORST TATTOO
OF THE DAY.

35:20.576 --> 35:24.705
- THAT'S MY TATTOO.
MY ARTIST WAS SCOTT.

35:24.789 --> 35:26.624
THAT WAS MY FIRST BIG TATTOO,

35:26.707 --> 35:29.544
AND IT WAS THE MOST
PAINFUL THING IN MY LIFE.

35:29.627 --> 35:30.878
- THE FANGS ARE SUPPOSED
TO BE COMING

35:30.962 --> 35:32.338
FROM THE ROOF OF THE MOUTH.

35:32.421 --> 35:33.673
IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S
KIND OF COMING FROM THE NOSE.

35:33.756 --> 35:34.882
- IT KIND OF HAS
THAT LOOK TO IT.

35:34.966 --> 35:36.217
- IT'S PERFECT.

35:36.300 --> 35:38.010
LIKE, EVERYTHING
IS ON PLACE.

35:38.094 --> 35:41.430
- ALSO, THE CURVE OF THE SNAKE
MAKES EVERYTHING INTO A BALL.

35:41.514 --> 35:42.807
HE COULD'VE OPENED IT UP.

35:42.890 --> 35:44.725
- HE COULDN'T DO
ANYTHING TOO BIG

35:44.809 --> 35:45.726
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T
WANT ME TO TAP OUT

35:45.810 --> 35:49.230
AND HAVE IT INCOMPLETE.

35:49.313 --> 35:51.524
- THAT'S MY TATTOO.
I HAD MELISSA.

35:51.607 --> 35:53.693
- THE HEAD OF THE SNAKE IS
NOT PROPORTIONED PROPERLY.

35:53.776 --> 35:55.695
THE HEAD LOOKS TOO BIG
FOR THAT BODY.

35:55.778 --> 35:57.238
- THINK IT DEPENDS
UPON WHAT TYPE OF SNAKE IT IS.

35:57.321 --> 35:59.574
- YOU HAVE THAT EXTRA,
LIKE, SNAGGLETOOTH.

35:59.657 --> 36:01.033
LOOKS, ACTUALLY,
LIKE, CARTOONY.

36:01.117 --> 36:02.326
- HONESTLY, I DON'T THINK
SHE COULD'VE NAILED IT

36:02.410 --> 36:03.494
ANY BETTER THAN SHE DID.

36:03.578 --> 36:07.540
YOU KNOW, I'M 100% SATISFIED
WITH IT.

36:07.623 --> 36:09.625
- THAT'S MY TATTOO,
AND MY ARTIST WAS SAUSAGE.

36:09.709 --> 36:11.335
- I THINK THE TONGUE IS
NOT TOO PROPORTIONATE.

36:11.419 --> 36:15.298
- COBRAS ACTUALLY HAVE
A VERY LONG TONGUE.

36:15.381 --> 36:17.758
- BUT IT'S, LIKE,
1/3 OF HIS BODY.

36:17.842 --> 36:19.594
- THE BACKGROUND, I JUST THINK,
IS REAL BASIC

36:19.677 --> 36:20.720
FOR THE STAGE OF THE GAME.

36:20.803 --> 36:22.263
IT'S JUST, OVERALL,
A SAFER TATTOO.

36:22.346 --> 36:23.931
- IT'S NOT, LIKE,
PLAYING IT SAFE.

36:24.015 --> 36:25.016
IT'S COMPLYING
TO WHAT I WANT.

36:25.099 --> 36:26.726
I REALLY DON'T FEEL LIKE

36:26.809 --> 36:27.727
MY TATTOO SHOULD BE
AT THE BOTTOM TODAY.

36:27.810 --> 36:29.312
- I THINK HE WANTED
TO PLEASE YOU

36:29.395 --> 36:33.482
MORE THAN HE WANTED TO WIN.

36:33.566 --> 36:34.650
- SO WE'VE REACHED
A DECISION.

36:34.734 --> 36:38.070
- YEAH.

36:39.655 --> 36:40.281
[door opens]

36:46.704 --> 36:48.915
- [sighs]
ALL RIGHT.

36:48.998 --> 36:52.418
MATTI, WHICH ARTIST ARE YOU
SENDING DOWN FOR ELIMINATION?

37:00.217 --> 37:02.303
- IT'S GONNA BE HALO.

37:04.931 --> 37:09.810
- ALL RIGHT, MATTI,
HALO, MELISSA,

37:09.894 --> 37:12.313
AND SCOTT,

37:12.396 --> 37:13.648
WE'LL SEE YOU DOWNSTAIRS.

37:13.731 --> 37:18.361
- HOLY [bleep].

37:18.444 --> 37:21.447
- LET'S JUST GET IT OVER WITH.

37:33.167 --> 37:35.503
- TODAY WE ASKED YOU
TO TATTOO A JAPANESE SNAKE

37:35.586 --> 37:37.672
ON YOUR CANVAS' RIBS.

37:37.755 --> 37:41.175
HALO, YOU'RE HERE BECAUSE MATTI
PUT YOU UP FOR ELIMINATION.

37:41.259 --> 37:43.719
MATTI,
WHY DID YOU CHOOSE HALO?

37:43.803 --> 37:45.930
- I WENT WITH HALO'S BECAUSE
OF THE SHEER SIZE AND IMPORTANCE

37:46.013 --> 37:48.891
OF THE MISTAKES THAT HE MADE.

37:48.975 --> 37:51.644
THE GIGANTIC BACKGROUND
AND THE SNAKE SPUN AROUND

37:51.727 --> 37:53.521
WITH THE BELLY SCALES AND JUST
WENT COMPLETELY BACKWARDS.

37:53.604 --> 37:56.023
- I THINK ONE
OF MY BIGGEST ISSUES SOMETIMES

37:56.107 --> 37:57.650
IS WHEN YOU OVERTHINK THINGS.

37:57.733 --> 38:02.321
I WENT INTO THIS CHALLENGE
THINKING TRADITIONAL JAPANESE.

38:02.405 --> 38:03.906
AND IF IT DIDN'T HIT
THE MARK, DUDE, LIKE,

38:03.990 --> 38:05.032
YOU CAN'T HIT A MARK EVERY TIME.

38:05.116 --> 38:08.160
- THIS BIG, BLACK SHAPE
PLASTERED ON THE SIDE

38:08.244 --> 38:09.537
OF THIS GUY'S BODY IS
JUST REALLY ABRUPT.

38:09.620 --> 38:12.748
IT GOES AGAINST THE WAY
JAPANESE TATTOOS FIT THE BODY.

38:12.832 --> 38:14.000
- WITH TRADITIONAL JAPANESE,
I'VE SEEN A LOT OF THINGS

38:14.083 --> 38:15.584
THAT DO MAKE ABRUPT STOPS.

38:15.668 --> 38:18.879
- YEAH, THE MUNEWARI SPLIT CHEST
GOES RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE.

38:18.963 --> 38:21.048
THOSE ARE FORMS
THAT WERE DESIGNED YEARS AGO.

38:21.132 --> 38:22.008
TATTOOING WAS ILLEGAL.

38:22.091 --> 38:23.384
- THEY HAD TO WEAR
ROBES AND STUFF.

38:23.467 --> 38:24.301
- RIGHT,
SO THEY'D BE ABLE TO COVER IT,

38:24.385 --> 38:25.636
BUT BY PLACING IT
RIGHT HERE,

38:25.720 --> 38:29.056
WHAT EFFECTIVELY YOU'VE DONE
IS NOW IF THEY DID WANT

38:29.140 --> 38:32.935
TO CONNECT A BACK PIECE TO IT,
IT WOULD BE HARD TO DO.

38:33.019 --> 38:35.438
- SCOTT, YOU'RE HERE BECAUSE
THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY DETERMINED

38:35.521 --> 38:39.734
THAT YOU HAD
THE WORST TATTOO OF THE DAY.

38:39.817 --> 38:41.068
- I DID WHAT I COULD, MAN.

38:41.152 --> 38:43.237
I HAD TO COMPROMISE
A LOT OF DESIGN WITH HER--

38:43.320 --> 38:44.572
BASICALLY, JUST HOW
SHE SAT AND EVERYTHING.

38:44.655 --> 38:46.407
- YOU HAVE A VERY UNIQUE STYLE
THAT'S YOUR OWN

38:46.490 --> 38:48.868
THAT YOU INCORPORATE
INTO EVERYTHING.

38:48.951 --> 38:49.994
THIS TATTOO,
YOU ABANDONED THAT.

38:50.077 --> 38:51.078
JUST KIND OF GOT LOST
IN YOUR OWN DESIGN.

38:51.162 --> 38:53.664
- IT HAS ITS PROBLEMS.

38:53.748 --> 38:54.957
THIS WOULD BE, LIKE, MY FIRST
HICCUP SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE.

38:55.041 --> 38:57.335
I'D LIKE YOU GUYS TO TAKE THAT
INTO CONSIDERATION

38:57.418 --> 38:58.627
BEFORE YOU MAKE
YOUR DECISION.

38:58.711 --> 39:00.796
- AESTHETICALLY,
IT'S DEFINITELY THE BOTTOM.

39:00.880 --> 39:02.298
- MELISSA.

39:02.381 --> 39:05.468
- IF YOU LOOK AT
YOUR APPLICATION VERSUS SCOTT,

39:05.551 --> 39:06.469
HALO, OR MATTI,

39:06.552 --> 39:08.596
TECHNICALLY,
WE FIND THE DIVIDE.

39:08.679 --> 39:10.598
- I DON'T HAVE AS MUCH
EXPERIENCE AS EVERYONE ELSE,

39:10.681 --> 39:14.143
BUT I HONESTLY HAVE
A LOT OF TALENT TO BACK IT UP.

39:14.226 --> 39:16.062
- YOUR COMPOSITION
IS VERY STIFF.

39:16.145 --> 39:18.022
YOU NEED TO LOOSEN UP.
YOU'RE A GOOD ARTIST.

39:18.105 --> 39:19.273
YOU'RE BATTLING
WITH THE BIG BOYS,

39:19.356 --> 39:23.110
AND YOU GOT A LOT OF ROOM
TO GROW IN YOUR SHOES.

39:24.236 --> 39:28.324
- HALO, SCOTT, MELISSA,

39:28.407 --> 39:32.661
ONE OF YOU IS ABOUT TO LOSE
YOUR PLACE IN THE TOP FOUR.

39:32.745 --> 39:35.498
THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED.

39:40.211 --> 39:41.253
MELISSA,

39:41.337 --> 39:44.256
YOU DO NOT HAVE
WHAT IT TAKES TO BE INK MASTER.

39:44.340 --> 39:45.800
- IT COMES DOWN
TO YOUR BODY OF WORK.

39:45.883 --> 39:49.053
JUSTIFIABLY, YOU MAY NOT HAVE
HAD THE WORST TATTOO OF THE DAY,

39:49.136 --> 39:51.180
AND I DON'T THINK YOU DID.

39:51.263 --> 39:52.473
WE'RE AT THE POINT NOW

39:52.556 --> 39:55.643
WHERE YOU DON'T HAVE A "W"
IN YOUR COLUMN,

39:55.726 --> 39:57.645
AND EVERYBODY ELSE
IN THE ROOM DOES.

39:57.728 --> 40:00.314
AND THAT'S THE ONLY THING
SAVING SOMEBODY WHO'S DOWN HERE

40:00.397 --> 40:01.899
WITH YOU
FROM NOT PACKING.

40:01.982 --> 40:03.984
OVERALL, YOU HAVE THE RESPECT
OF THE JUDGES.

40:04.068 --> 40:05.111
- THANK YOU.

40:05.194 --> 40:08.948
- PLEASE PACK YOUR MACHINES
AND CLOSE SHOP.

40:10.908 --> 40:12.159
- I DEFINITELY DIDN'T HAVE
THE WORST TATTOO OF THE DAY.

40:12.243 --> 40:16.205
IN EVERY ASPECT
BUT TECHNICAL,

40:16.288 --> 40:17.164
SCOTT'S TATTOO WAS LACKING.

40:17.248 --> 40:20.042
I DIDN'T DESERVE TO GO HOME.

40:20.126 --> 40:22.461
I DID A BETTER TATTOO
THAN HE DID.

40:25.381 --> 40:28.050
narrator: ON THE NEXT EPISODE
OF <i> INK MASTER...</i>

40:28.134 --> 40:29.135
- IT ALL COMES DOWN
TO THIS MOMENT.

40:29.218 --> 40:30.344
- THIS IS IT.

40:30.427 --> 40:34.014
- THE REAL BATTLE BETWEEN
THE FOUR OF YOU BEGINS

40:34.098 --> 40:35.683
RIGHT NOW.

40:35.766 --> 40:37.518
- YOU'RE GOING TO THE FINALE,
OR YOU'RE GOING HOME.

40:37.601 --> 40:39.687
- GAME ON.
- HALO BLEW IT TODAY.

40:39.770 --> 40:41.147
- MATTI--
TIME TO GET RID OF HIM.

40:41.230 --> 40:42.523
- I'M GONNA BE
AT THE FINALE.

40:42.606 --> 40:43.607
- I DON'T SEE IT THAT WAY.

40:43.691 --> 40:45.484
- I THINK SAUSAGE
IS GOING HOME.

40:45.568 --> 40:46.861
- WHAT AN ASS[bleep].

40:46.944 --> 40:48.487
- ONE ARTIST IS GOING HOME.

40:48.571 --> 40:50.114
- WE'VE NEVER HAD IT
BE THIS CLOSE.

40:50.197 --> 40:52.366
THIS IS THE REAL [bleep] DEAL.
- WOW.

40:52.449 --> 40:54.577
- THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED...
