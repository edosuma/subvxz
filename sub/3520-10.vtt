WEBVTT

00:28.697 --> 00:30.657
- Excuse us.
- Oh, sorry.

00:30.824 --> 00:32.659
- I was just trying to--

00:32.826 --> 00:34.828
You need to get yourself a fob.

00:34.994 --> 00:36.996
They're "fobulous."

00:37.997 --> 00:39.582
- Come on.
- Thank you.

00:39.749 --> 00:41.167
Thieves don't usually
bring valuables in.

00:41.334 --> 00:42.919
Unless they're genius thieves.

00:43.086 --> 00:44.671
So you never know.

00:48.591 --> 00:50.802
- Are you coming?
- Yes, yeah, thank you.

00:51.010 --> 00:54.013
Nice and tight.

00:54.222 --> 00:55.640
Whoops.

00:55.807 --> 00:59.185
Oh, wow, you really do need that fob
for everything around here.

00:59.352 --> 01:02.814
Yeah. Hey, are you moving into
that apartment with the roof garden?

01:02.981 --> 01:05.567
Yes. I'm Patrick.

01:05.734 --> 01:09.112
Milo. I had dreams
of switching to that place.

01:09.279 --> 01:11.698
- Five is so stuffy.
- I am Jake.

01:11.865 --> 01:14.492
Was that your husband
I saw earlier with the moving van?

01:14.659 --> 01:17.287
No, no, we're not married.
Uh, he's just my boyfriend.

01:17.454 --> 01:19.372
Oh, great.
We'll see you soon.

01:19.456 --> 01:20.832
- Welcome to the building.
- Thank you so much!

01:20.999 --> 01:22.459
I'm sure I'll see you--

01:36.973 --> 01:38.725
Yo!

01:38.892 --> 01:40.602
- Oh, God, is that our doorbell?
- Yeah.

01:40.769 --> 01:42.854
- It's a little--
- Get your cute ass in here.

01:42.979 --> 01:45.690
Shoes off.
This is a no-footwear home, okay?

01:45.815 --> 01:47.859
Oh, is it now?
All right, no shoes.

01:48.026 --> 01:49.652
Kiss me.

01:49.819 --> 01:53.031
Oh, God, so many boxes.

01:53.198 --> 01:55.617
Uh, hello, Kevin Costner.

01:55.784 --> 01:58.119
Pretty cool, isn't it?

01:58.286 --> 02:01.831
It's, um-- Here I thought I was
moving in with just one Kevin--

02:01.998 --> 02:03.625
- Ha!
- But-- No, it's...

02:03.792 --> 02:05.543
You like <i>Field of Dreams</i>, huh?

02:05.710 --> 02:08.546
Like it? I fucking love it.
It's the best film ever made.

02:08.713 --> 02:09.756
Really, ever?

02:09.964 --> 02:11.841
Oh, don't tell me you don't like
<i>Field of Dreams.</i>

02:12.008 --> 02:13.468
- It's just, it's been awhile.
- Has it?

02:13.593 --> 02:14.719
Yeah.

02:14.886 --> 02:17.514
I just realized
I don't know your stuff.

02:18.973 --> 02:20.183
Did my boxes get in okay?

02:20.350 --> 02:23.061
Oh, yeah. The delivery guys--
They were hot, by the way--

02:23.228 --> 02:25.396
- Oh, nice.
- Really hot.

02:25.563 --> 02:28.233
They muddled up all of our stuff.

02:28.399 --> 02:30.235
But I think it's okay, because
I've got all your stuff there,

02:30.401 --> 02:33.071
- and all of my stuff is there.
- Nice.

02:33.238 --> 02:35.657
- Ta-dah!
- Oh, amazing.

02:35.824 --> 02:38.493
To moving in and moving on.

02:38.660 --> 02:40.370
- To both those things.
- Cheers.

02:40.537 --> 02:41.913
Cheers.

02:43.081 --> 02:45.166
- Oh, God, that's good.
- I know.

02:51.339 --> 02:52.549
All right.

02:57.262 --> 02:59.722
- You okay?
- What do you mean?

02:59.889 --> 03:02.600
Saying goodbye
to Agustín and everything?

03:02.767 --> 03:04.644
- I know it's just baby steps.
- No, I'm good.

03:04.811 --> 03:07.564
This-- it feels right. I was just
telling the guys this morning.

03:07.730 --> 03:08.982
They think it's too fast.

03:09.148 --> 03:11.484
A little bit.
Actually, kind of a lot.

03:11.651 --> 03:14.195
They probably think
I'm crazy, but....

03:14.362 --> 03:16.447
- Do you think you're crazy?
- No.

03:16.614 --> 03:18.283
Not even a little bit.

03:18.449 --> 03:20.535
This is gonna sound weird,
but ever since my mom

03:20.702 --> 03:22.745
completely imploded our family,

03:22.912 --> 03:26.541
I feel oddly liberated.

03:26.708 --> 03:28.293
Why?

03:28.501 --> 03:30.712
I don't have anything
to live up to anymore.

03:31.629 --> 03:36.676
We get to make up
our own... way.

03:37.760 --> 03:39.554
Well...

03:39.721 --> 03:42.390
I am glad that I get
to make it with you.

03:45.351 --> 03:46.811
Come into the bedroom, please.

03:50.607 --> 03:52.984
Look at that view.

03:53.151 --> 03:55.111
I swear when I was a kid,
I never thought in a million years

03:55.278 --> 03:56.988
I would live
somewhere like this,

03:57.155 --> 03:58.781
above everyone.

03:58.948 --> 04:02.243
If those fuckers
could see me now.

04:02.410 --> 04:05.496
- Wait, can people see in?
- I hope so. Let's christen the bed.

04:05.663 --> 04:07.790
Anyway, wasn't it you who wanted
to fuck me against the window?

04:07.957 --> 04:09.459
That was before they were
our actual neighbors.

04:09.626 --> 04:11.002
I've already programmed
in the sleep numbers.

04:11.169 --> 04:12.837
You're at 75, I'm at 96.

04:13.004 --> 04:15.423
Wait, shouldn't we take
the plastic cover off first?

04:15.590 --> 04:17.634
Nah, it'll wipe clean this way.

04:19.469 --> 04:22.221
- Who's that?
- Is there a way to change that tone?

04:28.269 --> 04:31.314
Mmm. Maybe you should get it.
It might be important.

04:33.024 --> 04:34.651
It better be.

04:34.817 --> 04:37.528
Otherwise there's gonna be
<i>Big Trouble in Little China.</i>

05:00.134 --> 05:01.219
Who was it?

05:01.386 --> 05:03.179
Jake and Milo.

05:03.346 --> 05:05.223
You met them in the elevator,
I hear.

05:05.390 --> 05:06.891
Yes, yeah, yeah.
What do they want?

05:07.058 --> 05:10.061
They're having a Christmas drinky
thing tonight and they've invited us.

05:10.228 --> 05:11.312
Do you fancy it?

05:11.396 --> 05:13.106
Well, we've got
Agustín's mural thing.

05:13.272 --> 05:15.483
Oh, the mural thing, right.

05:15.650 --> 05:17.777
That's tonight, is it?
Cool.

05:19.112 --> 05:20.571
Do we have to go to that?

05:20.697 --> 05:22.699
It's a fundraiser
for the shelter, Scroogey.

05:22.865 --> 05:24.075
Yes, we have to go.

05:24.242 --> 05:25.952
Ah, well, if it's a fundraiser,
we should definitely go.

05:26.119 --> 05:29.288
We can just have a drink
with Jake and Milo another time.

05:29.455 --> 05:31.416
All right, well, maybe we can
stop by for a quick drink

05:31.582 --> 05:33.209
on the way out if you want.

05:33.376 --> 05:35.086
Good, thank you.

05:35.253 --> 05:37.463
- Because I already said yes.
- Oh.

05:37.630 --> 05:38.965
Now, come on, quick.
Fuck-me-in-the-butt time

05:39.132 --> 05:40.633
before someone else
rings that fucking bell.

05:48.975 --> 05:51.561
So, you guys doing all right?

05:51.728 --> 05:53.312
Yeah, yeah.
We just...

05:54.856 --> 05:56.024
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:56.190 --> 05:57.442
Hey, man!

05:57.608 --> 05:59.736
- What is up?
- How you doin'?

05:59.902 --> 06:01.112
- Good to see you, man.
- You too.

06:01.320 --> 06:02.947
Hope I didn't pull you away
from anything too important.

06:03.031 --> 06:06.534
No, I'm in my sixth meeting
this week on fuckin' Google buses.

06:06.701 --> 06:07.785
- Oh, shit.
- I'm good to get away.

06:07.869 --> 06:08.953
- Don't worry about it.
- Okay.

06:09.037 --> 06:11.414
I was just here getting some permits
for the new place.

06:11.581 --> 06:13.124
So I thought I'd see
if you were around.

06:13.291 --> 06:15.251
Dude, she misses you too.

06:15.418 --> 06:17.462
Okay?
All right, let's just cut to it.

06:17.628 --> 06:19.338
Please join me.

06:19.505 --> 06:21.215
Is she ever gonna
talk to me again?

06:21.382 --> 06:23.384
Well, you know,
she's working through it.

06:23.551 --> 06:25.136
I need for something to happen.

06:25.303 --> 06:27.346
She keeps cleaning shit.

06:27.513 --> 06:29.640
You know that thing in the drawer
that has the forks and knives?

06:29.807 --> 06:31.142
Who thinks about
keeping that thing clean?

06:31.309 --> 06:34.103
Oh, shit, she's pissed.
She gets kind of OCD.

06:34.270 --> 06:36.481
I'm like,
just give him a call, please.

06:36.647 --> 06:38.232
She won't.
She gets dug in.

06:38.357 --> 06:40.735
Yeah. Well, you just got
to come around.

06:40.902 --> 06:43.988
Seriously, just come around.
I'll tell her--

06:44.155 --> 06:46.741
I'll tell her you just want to go
for a walk or something.

06:46.908 --> 06:49.786
Please.
Please, for me, come on.

06:49.952 --> 06:52.622
Dom, she's probably home right now
scrubbing the welcome mats.

06:52.789 --> 06:53.831
- Okay, okay.
- We need you.

06:53.998 --> 06:56.000
- You're saying yes?
- I'm saying yes.

06:56.167 --> 06:58.002
Good man.
That's what I want to hear.

06:58.169 --> 07:00.421
- Thanks, man.
- No problem. Any time.

07:02.507 --> 07:04.092
Hey, you-- you love her, right?

07:06.010 --> 07:07.428
Big time.

07:09.722 --> 07:13.226
Good.
Just making sure.

07:17.021 --> 07:20.358
- Whoa, nice apartment.
- Whoa.

07:22.068 --> 07:23.569
It's the penthouse playmates.

07:23.736 --> 07:26.447
I like that.
Thank you for having us.

07:26.614 --> 07:27.698
Are you kidding?

07:27.824 --> 07:29.784
We just want access
to that rooftop garden of yours.

07:29.951 --> 07:32.328
Why is that then? You want to
plant some seed up there?

07:32.495 --> 07:34.455
Oh!

07:34.622 --> 07:37.542
Thanks for coming
on your big move-in day.

07:37.708 --> 07:39.502
There's bourbon punch.

07:39.669 --> 07:40.878
- Yum.
- That's lethal.

07:41.045 --> 07:42.797
- Okay.
- Partake.

07:42.964 --> 07:44.257
- We will, thank you.
- We will, thank you.

07:44.423 --> 07:45.967
- Yeah.
- Of course.

07:46.134 --> 07:47.552
- See you in a bit then, boys.
- Welcome.

07:47.718 --> 07:48.886
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

07:49.053 --> 07:50.805
- Hey, cute accent.
- Hey.

07:50.972 --> 07:53.307
Oh, thank you very much.
Thank you.

07:54.058 --> 07:55.643
Here we go.

07:55.810 --> 07:57.436
It's very white, isn't it?

07:57.603 --> 07:59.981
- The apartment?
- No, no, the crowd.

08:00.148 --> 08:02.066
Everyone is white.

08:02.233 --> 08:05.486
Oh, yeah.
And not one ugly person.

08:05.653 --> 08:07.238
Well... that guy.

08:07.405 --> 08:08.656
You guys just gonna
hover over this thing?

08:08.823 --> 08:10.324
Oh, sorry, sorry.
Two minutes and then--

08:10.491 --> 08:12.326
No, I'm kidding.
You guys are from upstairs, right?

08:12.493 --> 08:14.287
Wow, word really travels fast.

08:14.453 --> 08:16.372
Yeah, this crowd.

08:16.539 --> 08:19.542
It's a lot the same.
One party blends into the next.

08:19.709 --> 08:22.587
You know, so new meat
is of interest.

08:22.837 --> 08:24.547
New meat?

08:24.714 --> 08:27.049
Don't be intimidated.
We're fun.

08:27.216 --> 08:29.886
And as the night goes on,
we get a little bit wild.

08:30.052 --> 08:32.471
So, uh... drink up, boys.

08:32.638 --> 08:34.348
Hey-- Oh, I got you.

08:34.515 --> 08:35.975
All right.

08:39.103 --> 08:40.271
Mm-hmm.

08:40.438 --> 08:43.107
My God, what is happening
right now?

08:43.274 --> 08:44.984
Three people
just said the same thing.

08:45.151 --> 08:46.777
But it cannot be
an orgy situation,

08:46.944 --> 08:48.613
not with this group
of vanilla cupcakes.

08:48.779 --> 08:50.573
Everyone just must be
making out or something.

08:50.740 --> 08:52.950
I don't know. They keep talking
about a second bedroom.

08:53.117 --> 08:54.619
What do you think happens
in the second bedroom?

08:54.785 --> 08:57.413
I don't know, but that sounds like
the tagline for a horror movie.

08:57.580 --> 09:00.499
Something, Patrick,
is definitely going down.

09:00.666 --> 09:03.169
Because everyone
is so fucking flirty.

09:03.336 --> 09:04.629
Yeah, with you,

09:04.795 --> 09:07.131
which I love,
because I've got you.

09:09.008 --> 09:10.301
Let's go, shall we?

09:10.468 --> 09:12.011
You want to leave, don't you?

09:12.178 --> 09:13.804
I don't know.

09:13.971 --> 09:16.307
Maybe we should
stay and watch.

09:16.474 --> 09:19.977
A little lookie-loo
of some nookie-noo action?

09:20.144 --> 09:21.520
Why not?

09:21.687 --> 09:24.106
All right, Patrick.

09:24.273 --> 09:27.360
Easy on the punch.

09:28.819 --> 09:31.197
So sorry.
Excuse me.

09:34.283 --> 09:35.826
Breaking news?

09:35.993 --> 09:37.662
Um, oldest news ever.

09:37.828 --> 09:39.747
We're comparing Grindr profiles.

09:39.914 --> 09:41.707
- That's the oldest news ever.
- Yeah.

09:41.874 --> 09:43.417
Yeah, and trying to figure out
who's who.

09:43.584 --> 09:45.378
We all know profiles can be
very deceiving.

09:45.544 --> 09:46.671
Right.

09:46.837 --> 09:49.465
Hey, is this that guy
over by the-- by the sushi?

09:49.632 --> 09:51.175
The guy with the coat?

09:51.342 --> 09:52.885
Well, you have to
erase the beard.

09:53.052 --> 09:55.263
No, why would he have a beard
on his profile, but not in real life?

09:55.429 --> 09:57.181
No, that's not him.

09:57.348 --> 09:59.475
- Who's Romford?
- Who?

09:59.642 --> 10:03.396
Ooh, let's see. Romford has no pic
and no profile.

10:03.562 --> 10:05.731
He's the closest guy
to us.

10:05.898 --> 10:09.277
Romford is all up
in our grill right now.

10:09.527 --> 10:10.861
How you doin'?
You okay?

10:11.028 --> 10:13.281
Yeah.
We should go.

10:13.447 --> 10:15.491
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, sorry, guys.

10:15.658 --> 10:17.034
Okay. Uh, yeah.

10:17.201 --> 10:18.995
Oh, we're late
for this fundraiser thing

10:19.161 --> 10:20.538
for these trans teens downtown.

10:20.705 --> 10:22.290
Listen, we'll make it up
to you guys, okay?

10:22.456 --> 10:23.708
Drinks soon.
Sorry, sorry.

10:25.876 --> 10:28.129
Whoa, whoa, Patrick?
Patrick, what's happened?

10:28.296 --> 10:30.047
- I need a fucking fob.
- Okay.

10:30.214 --> 10:31.799
- Are we-- we going home?
- Yeah.

10:31.966 --> 10:33.509
All right.

10:33.676 --> 10:36.762
What is it? What's happened?

10:36.929 --> 10:39.181
Are you Rompford?

10:41.267 --> 10:43.144
- Uh...
- Yeah, yeah, of course you are.

10:43.311 --> 10:45.229
It's where you grew up. It'd be
a crazy coincidence otherwise.

10:45.396 --> 10:46.689
I can see what you're thinking
right now,

10:46.856 --> 10:47.940
but please don't freak out
about this.

10:48.107 --> 10:50.818
I'm not freaking out. I'm really not.
I'd just love to know what's what,

10:50.985 --> 10:54.739
and what you're doing
on a hook-up site.

10:54.905 --> 10:58.075
If Romford is on Grindr,
that means Romford was on Grindr

10:58.242 --> 10:59.910
within the last few hours.

11:00.077 --> 11:02.663
I went on because I wanted to know
who else was in the building.

11:02.830 --> 11:04.915
- Why?
- Why? I don't know why.

11:05.082 --> 11:06.917
Because I was bored
waiting for you.

11:07.084 --> 11:09.754
Who doesn't want to know what other
homos are lurking in the shadows?

11:09.920 --> 11:11.005
You don't do that?

11:11.172 --> 11:12.465
I don't have Grindr
on my phone.

11:12.631 --> 11:15.176
- Oh, come on, Patrick? Really?
- No, not anymore.

11:15.301 --> 11:16.969
And I guess I don't understand
why you do.

11:17.136 --> 11:19.388
Haven't you gone from
relationship to relationship?

11:19.555 --> 11:21.932
Okay, babe,
check my history.

11:22.099 --> 11:24.226
Go on, you won't see any favorites,
no chats, no pictures, nothing.

11:24.393 --> 11:26.437
- Go on, try for yourself.
- I'm not gonna check your phone.

11:26.604 --> 11:28.105
Then please--

11:28.272 --> 11:30.941
Please don't read into
something that isn't there, okay?

11:32.943 --> 11:34.653
Just tell me I didn't move in
with a sex addict.

11:34.820 --> 11:37.114
For fuck's--

11:39.075 --> 11:40.451
You didn't move in
with a sex addict.

11:40.618 --> 11:42.370
- Okay.
- And if I am a sex addict,

11:42.536 --> 11:44.538
I'm a sex addict with you.

11:44.705 --> 11:46.374
- Shit.
- Yeah, answer that. I need to piss.

11:46.540 --> 11:48.292
I'm going to piss
and then we're gonna go, okay?

11:48.459 --> 11:49.627
Okay.

11:53.130 --> 11:55.299
- Hey.
<i>- Hey, where you at?</i>

11:56.467 --> 11:58.177
Oh, shit.
Um, sorry.

11:58.344 --> 12:00.137
Just, we got into something.

12:00.304 --> 12:01.931
<i>What kind of thing?</i>

12:02.098 --> 12:03.516
Um...

12:04.809 --> 12:08.312
Do you think it's weird
if Kevin is on Grindr?

12:09.480 --> 12:11.148
It depends.

12:11.315 --> 12:13.818
<i>Well, he doesn't have a picture
or a profile or anything.</i>

12:13.984 --> 12:16.195
<i>It's more out of curiosity.</i>

12:16.362 --> 12:18.322
No, it's, uh...

12:18.447 --> 12:20.491
Look, everybody's got the app
on their phone, right?

12:20.658 --> 12:23.160
It's what you do
with it that matters.

12:23.327 --> 12:24.995
Right.

12:25.162 --> 12:26.872
Totally, yes.

12:27.039 --> 12:29.333
Yes. Listen, I'm gonna go because
he's actually in the bathroom--

12:29.500 --> 12:31.669
Okay, listen.
Just breathe, Paddy, okay?

12:31.836 --> 12:34.004
And, uh, get your butt
over here.

12:34.171 --> 12:36.006
<i>Okay, I'll see you soon.</i>

12:36.173 --> 12:38.008
All right, bye.

12:38.843 --> 12:41.512
Uh, looks like I might not have to
find a new roommate after all.

12:41.679 --> 12:44.181
- No?
- Kevin's on Grindr.

12:44.348 --> 12:47.017
Brother.

12:48.269 --> 12:49.979
What's the matter?
You not feeling good?

12:50.146 --> 12:51.856
Just like PrEP side effects.

12:52.022 --> 12:53.566
Or maybe you're just nervous?

12:53.732 --> 12:55.359
Well, I didn't paint it, so...

12:55.526 --> 12:57.653
For Sammi, not for you,
you narcissist.

12:57.820 --> 12:59.530
I'm just glad I convinced her
against the slogan,

12:59.697 --> 13:01.740
"I want a pussy,
so suck my dick."

13:01.907 --> 13:04.368
Oh! She can save that
for her Christmas card.

13:04.535 --> 13:07.621
Ah... can you wear this
for the next two weeks?

13:07.788 --> 13:09.290
Okay.

13:15.045 --> 13:17.548
Do you want a quick PBJ
without the "J" before we leave?

13:17.715 --> 13:20.217
Uh, peanut butter
is disgusting.

13:20.384 --> 13:21.594
What?

13:21.760 --> 13:24.054
Really, how do you not know this?

13:24.221 --> 13:26.390
How have you not heard
my rant about nut butter?

13:26.557 --> 13:28.559
About keeping your nuts
and your butter separate?

13:28.726 --> 13:31.437
Well, I didn't know
there was such a thing.

13:33.772 --> 13:35.649
Okay, you know what?
Can I just ask this?

13:35.816 --> 13:36.901
I just want to know.

13:37.943 --> 13:39.820
When you were with Jon,

13:39.987 --> 13:42.531
did you hook up
with other people?

13:42.698 --> 13:44.909
Apart from you?

13:45.075 --> 13:46.410
Come on, you know
what I'm asking.

13:46.577 --> 13:49.497
And this is not an interrogation.
I just-- Be honest.

13:49.705 --> 13:52.583
That's what the CIA say
before they start waterboarding.

13:52.750 --> 13:55.294
There will be no waterboarding,
I promise.

13:56.754 --> 14:00.257
Well, it was complicated,
as you know.

14:00.424 --> 14:03.552
We spent a lot of time apart.

14:03.719 --> 14:06.055
Wait, so you're saying
you had an arrangement?

14:06.764 --> 14:07.973
No.

14:08.140 --> 14:09.683
But you hooked up
with other people?

14:09.767 --> 14:13.103
Mmm... it wasn't really like that.

14:13.229 --> 14:14.605
Well, what was it like?

14:14.730 --> 14:19.109
Just, you know--
a few things happened a few times,

14:19.276 --> 14:21.487
and it was
just little things--

14:21.654 --> 14:23.531
What kind of little things?

14:25.324 --> 14:28.369
I don't think this is a good terrain
to get into right now.

14:28.536 --> 14:30.955
No, really, it's okay.
I-- I--

14:31.121 --> 14:34.625
I want us to talk
about these things like adults.

14:36.460 --> 14:38.212
Like adults?

14:38.379 --> 14:42.132
Okay.
Well, it was, uh...

14:42.299 --> 14:46.303
you know, minor things, like...

14:46.470 --> 14:48.806
a little tug in the steam room
at the gym,

14:48.973 --> 14:51.600
or, you know, a massage or two
with a happy ending.

14:51.767 --> 14:53.143
But, you know, I don't even
think that counts.

14:53.352 --> 14:57.273
- Why doesn't that count?
- Because it's just a massage.

14:57.398 --> 14:58.899
Did Jon know?

14:59.066 --> 15:02.319
Okay, don't get all judgy on me.
You sound like your sister.

15:02.486 --> 15:04.697
I seem to remember you
telling me

15:04.863 --> 15:06.824
about some wank you had
in the woods.

15:06.991 --> 15:09.368
It was an aborted wank,
Which-- It's different. I was single.

15:09.535 --> 15:12.037
Patrick...

15:12.204 --> 15:14.707
This is in the past, okay?

15:14.873 --> 15:16.584
You're not Jon.

15:16.750 --> 15:18.752
This is not me and Jon.
And you know, to be honest,

15:18.919 --> 15:22.715
I'm actually really fucking happy
I cheated on him.

15:22.881 --> 15:24.341
Why?

15:24.508 --> 15:26.302
Because if I hadn't
cheated on him,

15:26.468 --> 15:28.929
we wouldn't be together.

15:30.723 --> 15:32.433
So can we just leave it
in the past,

15:32.600 --> 15:34.518
and concentrate
on the future?

15:37.771 --> 15:41.358
Now I have to pee.

16:22.900 --> 16:25.277
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

16:25.444 --> 16:27.488
Are you--
Are you ready to go?

16:27.655 --> 16:31.116
Yeah, just--
Just give me a minute.

16:31.283 --> 16:34.078
Um, okay.

16:35.245 --> 16:37.498
Patrick, I don't want
what Jon and I had.

16:37.665 --> 16:39.458
Ever. I don't want
to go back there again.

16:39.625 --> 16:41.752
- Neither do I.
- Good.

16:41.919 --> 16:46.757
It's just all the lying and
the feeling guilty and shitty.

16:46.924 --> 16:49.385
- Yeah.
- That's just so not what I want.

16:49.551 --> 16:51.553
- Good. We want the same thing.
- Exactly.

16:51.720 --> 16:55.933
And you asked me if Jon knew about
all the-- the little things.

16:56.100 --> 16:59.019
Well, he didn't.
And I don't want that for us.

16:59.186 --> 17:01.939
I don't want any secrets.
I want us to be better.

17:02.106 --> 17:05.317
I want us to be
completely honest.

17:05.484 --> 17:07.611
Good. Okay.

17:09.405 --> 17:12.282
Okay, and, uh...

17:15.494 --> 17:17.788
I wasn't expecting
to have this conversation,

17:17.955 --> 17:20.708
um, tonight. Uh...

17:20.874 --> 17:23.377
I wasn't.

17:23.544 --> 17:25.963
Okay, but...

17:28.465 --> 17:29.633
But what?

17:29.800 --> 17:32.469
I'm not saying
I want an open relationship,

17:32.636 --> 17:34.388
but it's a very gray area.

17:34.555 --> 17:36.640
Oh, my God, I don't think I like
the sound of your gray area.

17:36.807 --> 17:38.475
I think we should just
be realistic.

17:38.642 --> 17:40.144
Is it realism or just
an excuse to fuck around?

17:40.310 --> 17:43.230
Okay, calm down, okay?
All I'm saying is,

17:43.397 --> 17:45.858
if something happens, it doesn't have
to be the end of the world

17:46.024 --> 17:47.151
as long as we talk about it.

17:47.317 --> 17:48.986
So are we talking
about steam room jerk-offs,

17:49.153 --> 17:50.779
or do you want to go back
downstairs to the fifth floor

17:50.863 --> 17:52.614
and join the KKK butt orgy?

17:52.781 --> 17:55.200
Yes, that's it.
That's exactly what I'm saying.

17:55.367 --> 17:56.785
- Jesus Christ.
- What the fuck is this thing?

17:56.952 --> 17:58.704
Wait a second.
When Jake and Milo came by earlier,

17:58.871 --> 18:00.330
did they give you the skinny
on the sex party?

18:00.497 --> 18:01.707
Is that why you wanted
to go down there?

18:01.874 --> 18:02.958
Can you put little Ted down, please?

18:03.125 --> 18:04.501
He's very fragile.
He's already lost an eye.

18:04.668 --> 18:06.003
No, they didn't.

18:06.170 --> 18:07.588
Why are you so mad?

18:07.755 --> 18:09.339
- I'm not--
- It's a discussion.

18:09.506 --> 18:12.009
I'm not mad,
I'm just confused.

18:12.176 --> 18:14.136
I guess I always assumed
that we were gonna be exclusive.

18:14.303 --> 18:17.598
So it's a little bit of a shock
to find out on the moving-in day

18:17.765 --> 18:19.558
that you don't even want
to try and be monogamous.

18:19.725 --> 18:21.268
Okay, monogamy, Patrick--
Monogamy, why?

18:21.351 --> 18:23.020
Why is that so important to you?

18:23.187 --> 18:24.897
Have you ever
asked yourself that? Why?

18:25.063 --> 18:28.484
I-- I don't know. I guess I've always
just felt like I wanted to be

18:28.650 --> 18:31.320
devoted to someone, and feel like
someone is also devoted to me.

18:31.487 --> 18:33.655
Right, okay, well, your own mother
doesn't believe in monogamy.

18:33.822 --> 18:34.907
- Oh, wow, really?
- So-- Okay.

18:35.073 --> 18:36.700
You know what? Fuck you very much
for a lovely day.

18:36.867 --> 18:39.620
You can just buzz me in or fob me in
or whatever the fuck when I get back.

18:39.787 --> 18:41.288
Right now, I just want
to go see my friends,

18:41.371 --> 18:42.956
if I could just find
my other fucking shoe!

18:43.123 --> 18:45.501
Are you seriously storming out?

18:45.667 --> 18:46.919
No, no, no.
I just want to go to this mural.

18:47.085 --> 18:48.712
I'm actually super
into trans issues right now.

18:48.879 --> 18:50.589
You're blowing this
so out of proportion.

18:50.756 --> 18:52.049
- Oh, please.
- You bang on about honesty.

18:52.216 --> 18:54.176
Maybe you should look
in the mirror.

18:54.343 --> 18:55.803
I just did, and I look fine.

18:55.969 --> 18:57.805
My hair is looking a little
middle-aged lesbian, but whatever.

18:58.013 --> 19:00.224
Wasn't it you who wanted to have
a little lookie-loo downstairs?

19:00.390 --> 19:02.309
And wasn't it you who called me up
in the middle of the night

19:02.476 --> 19:03.977
when I was in bed
with my boyfriend

19:04.144 --> 19:05.479
to drive all the way out
to the Russian River

19:05.646 --> 19:06.814
and fuck you
against a redwood?

19:06.980 --> 19:08.190
Again, that's different.
I was single.

19:08.357 --> 19:10.734
Oh-- Oh, you were single?
Sorry, yes. No, you were.

19:10.901 --> 19:13.570
You were single. But then wasn't it
you who let me fuck you,

19:13.737 --> 19:16.824
whilst you were still
with Richie, without a condom?

19:18.617 --> 19:19.827
- You cunt.
- Yeah. Look, I'm sorry.

19:19.993 --> 19:22.329
I'm just feeling
very anxious right now.

19:22.496 --> 19:23.539
What do I hit
to go to lobby?

19:23.705 --> 19:25.207
Do I have to get a fob
to go down as well?

19:25.374 --> 19:27.584
Seriously, you're telling me
there isn't a world

19:27.751 --> 19:29.253
where you might slip up?

19:29.419 --> 19:31.046
Of course. Who the hell knows
what could happen?

19:31.213 --> 19:33.882
But the difference is I'm not looking
for a hall pass to slip up.

19:34.049 --> 19:36.260
Right, okay.
Well, I'm gonna set the scene.

19:36.426 --> 19:38.762
- The scene?
- The steam room at Fitness SF.

19:38.929 --> 19:40.848
Well, I'm a member of World Gym,
so whatever.

19:41.014 --> 19:42.766
Whatever.
And Zac Efron walks in--

19:42.933 --> 19:45.018
- Zac Efron?
- Chris Pratt, Mark Ruffalo.

19:45.185 --> 19:46.854
One of those guys. They walk in,
they sit down next to you

19:47.020 --> 19:48.522
- and they start jerking off.
- Well, I don't know.

19:48.689 --> 19:51.108
We talking about real Ruffalo and
Pratt or guys that look like them?

19:51.275 --> 19:52.943
Whatever, Patrick,
but they've got their dicks out,

19:53.110 --> 19:55.445
and they're nice, and they're new and
they're not like my boring old dick,

19:55.612 --> 19:57.614
and they want to play
a little game of reach around.

19:57.781 --> 19:59.491
And you're telling me--
You're telling me

19:59.658 --> 20:01.785
you wouldn't join in?
You'd just leave?

20:01.952 --> 20:03.287
- Yes.
- That is bullshit.

20:03.453 --> 20:04.955
Because I'm with you.

20:05.122 --> 20:07.624
Because I would put what I have
with you over some quick thrill.

20:07.791 --> 20:10.085
But it's just a hand job. It's just
your hand on someone else's penis.

20:10.252 --> 20:12.671
It's not going to affect what we feel
for each other or our lives together.

20:12.838 --> 20:15.090
I know it's just a hand job, but
maybe that's different about us.

20:15.257 --> 20:16.967
And before you say anything
about me being a prude,

20:17.134 --> 20:19.094
it's not that, okay?
I don't care what other people do.

20:19.636 --> 20:22.389
I only care about what you do
and what I do.

20:22.556 --> 20:24.141
Oh, Jesus Christ,
where are we?

20:24.308 --> 20:25.809
This building
is a fucking torture chamber.

20:25.976 --> 20:27.853
- Just calm down.
- Listen, all I can hear right now

20:28.020 --> 20:30.105
is that you want
to fuck other people.

20:30.272 --> 20:33.817
And the reason you want to do that
is because I'm not enough.

20:33.984 --> 20:35.569
- And I wish I was a more secure--
- You are enough!

20:35.736 --> 20:37.946
- It's nothing to do with that.
- Listen, I know what you're saying.

20:38.113 --> 20:40.449
Ask me again in ten years,
maybe I'll feel differently.

20:40.616 --> 20:42.409
But all I know is,
right now, I can,

20:42.576 --> 20:44.578
and I want to make the choice
to not fuck other people,

20:44.745 --> 20:47.080
and you can't or won't,
or don't even want to try.

20:47.247 --> 20:48.665
So where does that put us?

20:48.832 --> 20:52.669
And the thing is now,
the fucking cat is out of the bag.

20:52.836 --> 20:54.963
So every time you go to the gym,
or get a massage,

20:55.130 --> 20:56.965
or go get a fucking bagel,

20:57.132 --> 20:59.509
I'm gonna wonder
what you're doing, okay?

20:59.676 --> 21:03.180
And you're such a good liar,
Kevin. I've seen you do it.

21:03.347 --> 21:05.015
Well, I'm not lying now.

21:05.182 --> 21:07.351
I am telling the truth.
Yes, I know, Patrick,

21:07.517 --> 21:09.061
these things
are hard to talk about.

21:09.227 --> 21:12.064
But-- what the fuck
is this fight about?

21:12.230 --> 21:13.857
- What do you mean?
- What is this fight about?

21:14.024 --> 21:16.109
Is this a fight to break us up
or to keep us together?

21:16.276 --> 21:17.653
- What?
- Do you actually want to be with me?

21:17.819 --> 21:19.321
'Cause it feels like
you're looking for an escape.

21:19.488 --> 21:22.449
I mean, literally above your head,
there's a sign that says "exit."

21:22.616 --> 21:24.910
Please, what are you doing?

21:25.077 --> 21:28.705
Don't sabotage this
before we've even had a chance.

21:28.872 --> 21:32.376
I've upturned my life
for you.

21:32.542 --> 21:35.545
I want us to be together,
if it's possible,

21:35.712 --> 21:39.716
until we're two old miserable cunts
sat on a porch.

21:39.883 --> 21:42.594
But if you don't want that, Patrick,

21:42.761 --> 21:44.888
if you don't want that,

21:45.055 --> 21:47.766
then you should just go, please.

21:49.393 --> 21:52.229
And go right now.

21:57.234 --> 21:58.610
Oop.

22:01.780 --> 22:04.116
- So we're going on a walk?
- Mm-hmm.

22:04.282 --> 22:06.451
Is this gonna be like <i>The Godfather</i>
or something?

22:07.661 --> 22:09.204
You have a wreath.

22:10.914 --> 22:13.333
Oh, shit.
I do. Weird.

22:13.500 --> 22:15.919
How the fuck did that happen?

22:16.086 --> 22:18.422
I have reindeer, too.

22:18.588 --> 22:21.550
And he watches football, right?

22:21.717 --> 22:23.760
Not just the Niners,
but, like, other teams.

22:23.927 --> 22:25.595
- Wow.
- Which is so weird.

22:25.762 --> 22:28.640
Apparently you can, you know,
put a Cher wig on a guy

22:28.807 --> 22:32.769
and they still end up
being uber straight.

22:32.936 --> 22:35.564
And he rocked that wig
better than I rocked mine.

22:35.731 --> 22:38.483
I know.
It was confusing.

22:46.658 --> 22:48.160
Cool.

22:48.326 --> 22:50.996
Dor, I hate this.

22:51.163 --> 22:53.290
You think I don't?

22:53.457 --> 22:55.792
I was such a fucking asshole.

22:55.959 --> 22:58.962
Yeah, you were.
You totally were.

22:59.129 --> 23:01.673
But I should have never pulled
the fag hag card. You know that?

23:01.840 --> 23:03.383
And that's-- Oh, my God,
that has been playing

23:03.467 --> 23:05.093
over and over again in my head
for these past few weeks.

23:05.260 --> 23:08.263
I don't want to ignore
the other things you said.

23:08.430 --> 23:12.100
No, good. I don't think you should
'cause I was fucking right.

23:12.267 --> 23:15.729
I mean, you know, some of that stuff
should stick definitely.

23:15.896 --> 23:17.189
Yeah.

23:17.355 --> 23:19.733
But I also feel like that
we've been really fucked up,

23:19.900 --> 23:21.151
and we need
to own that shit.

23:21.318 --> 23:23.779
- You know?
- Exactly.

23:23.945 --> 23:27.866
And I want
to get through this now.

23:28.033 --> 23:30.744
Okay, can we?
Because I cannot do this.

23:30.911 --> 23:32.871
- I can't handle it. I really can't.
- Yeah.

23:33.038 --> 23:35.165
This has been like going through
the worst fucking break-up

23:35.373 --> 23:37.709
- that I've ever been through.
- I know, me too.

23:40.712 --> 23:43.924
But we do kind of need
to break up, Dor.

23:46.635 --> 23:49.054
We do.

23:49.221 --> 23:53.642
You did the most generous thing
anyone's ever done for me, and...

23:54.810 --> 23:58.021
But I really need
to try this on my own,

23:58.188 --> 24:00.857
however I can.

24:01.024 --> 24:02.234
I still want to help you.

24:02.400 --> 24:05.904
So if I fall on my ass,
then come get hammered with me.

24:06.071 --> 24:09.032
And if it works out,
then you have to be the first person

24:09.199 --> 24:11.076
at that window
on opening day.

24:11.243 --> 24:13.745
But you need to

24:13.912 --> 24:16.706
start thinking
about someone else first,

24:16.873 --> 24:18.708
instead of me.

24:24.756 --> 24:27.592
He's a great fucking guy.

24:31.805 --> 24:34.015
And I really liked seeing you
come out of his door

24:34.182 --> 24:35.475
with a big wreath on it.

24:35.642 --> 24:37.936
I kind of did too.

24:39.312 --> 24:41.690
Those reindeer, though, are too much.
Right, doesn't it--

24:41.857 --> 24:44.276
- Overkill.
- Yeah, totally.

24:45.485 --> 24:47.571
Not my idea.

24:56.663 --> 25:00.083
All I can think about
is that bed downstairs.

25:00.250 --> 25:02.669
Then let's go to bed.

25:02.836 --> 25:05.839
No, when it's made,
it's fucking perfect, but underneath,

25:06.006 --> 25:10.177
there are two very different sides
with very different sleep numbers.

25:10.343 --> 25:13.638
Patrick, please don't say you're
comparing what we have to a mattress.

25:13.805 --> 25:16.600
I don't mean just because of
the stuff we talked about tonight.

25:20.103 --> 25:22.272
I'm talking
about fundamentals here.

25:22.439 --> 25:24.774
Essentials.

25:24.941 --> 25:26.484
I can't believe
this is happening.

25:26.651 --> 25:29.362
This is all because
of a Grindr profile.

25:29.529 --> 25:32.407
I swear to God, I want to throw
my phone off this fucking roof.

25:32.574 --> 25:35.160
God, I wish it was just that.

25:35.327 --> 25:38.622
Kevin, I just--

25:38.788 --> 25:41.917
I don't know,
I feel like maybe

25:42.083 --> 25:44.252
your heart works one way
and mine works the other.

25:44.419 --> 25:48.006
No, I don't believe that.
I don't believe that.

25:48.173 --> 25:50.508
Listen, what makes me
really fucking sad and frustrated

25:50.675 --> 25:52.636
is that deep down,
I've always known that.

25:52.802 --> 25:55.222
And I've just ignored it, because...

25:55.388 --> 25:57.474
I just wanted this so much.
I wanted to be in love,

25:57.641 --> 26:00.477
and be in a relationship,
and prove to myself,

26:00.644 --> 26:02.270
and my friends,
and my family,

26:02.354 --> 26:04.105
and, fuck, to prove to
the entire world

26:04.272 --> 26:06.650
that I was actually capable
of being in one.

26:06.816 --> 26:10.278
Patrick, this can work.

26:10.445 --> 26:13.156
It is working.

26:13.323 --> 26:16.576
Yeah, but I have to keep
readjusting my sleep numbers,

26:16.743 --> 26:18.995
each and every night,
just a tiny bit,

26:19.162 --> 26:21.498
until one day I feel like
I'd wake up and think, "Fuck,

26:21.665 --> 26:23.833
"I haven't slept well
in years."

26:24.000 --> 26:27.003
Well, then I will adjust.
That is what you do in relationships.

26:27.170 --> 26:29.047
That is what the bed
is designed for.

26:29.214 --> 26:32.425
Though we need to stop
using that as a metaphor.

26:32.592 --> 26:34.511
- Agreed.
- Patrick, look at me, please.

26:34.678 --> 26:36.888
Look at me.

26:37.055 --> 26:38.932
This can't end tonight.

26:39.683 --> 26:43.019
You have to give it time.
Now that I know how you feel,

26:43.186 --> 26:45.855
I can make the choice
to change. Okay?

26:46.022 --> 26:49.025
Look. You just--

26:51.027 --> 26:52.696
You just have to trust me.

26:54.364 --> 26:55.532
Look at me.

26:57.409 --> 26:59.703
You just need...

27:01.162 --> 27:03.039
to trust me.

29:06.746 --> 29:08.164
Hey.

29:08.331 --> 29:09.541
Hey.

29:11.376 --> 29:13.169
Thanks for letting me
come by.

29:14.879 --> 29:16.714
So what's up?

29:19.509 --> 29:22.011
Do you mind if I
sit down, actually?

29:22.178 --> 29:23.221
Of course.

29:23.388 --> 29:26.391
And if it's okay with you,
I'd rather not talk

29:26.558 --> 29:28.726
about anything.

29:28.893 --> 29:30.854
I'm totally talked out.

29:31.020 --> 29:32.480
No, that's-- that's fine.

29:34.357 --> 29:36.025
You know what I would like, though?

29:36.192 --> 29:37.610
What's that?

29:37.777 --> 29:40.697
To stop looking
like a middle-aged lesbian.

29:40.864 --> 29:43.616
<i>Pato.</i>

29:44.409 --> 29:45.827
Will you cut my hair?

29:47.036 --> 29:48.496
All right.

29:48.663 --> 29:52.625
Actually, you know what?
Just... buzz it off.

29:52.792 --> 29:54.419
- Really?
- Really.

29:56.045 --> 29:57.672
Wow.

30:05.430 --> 30:06.764
Okay.

30:10.685 --> 30:12.479
I finally get to cut your hair.

30:17.275 --> 30:18.359
You ready?

30:22.113 --> 30:23.573
I'm ready.
