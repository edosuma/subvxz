Previously on <i>Bates Motel...</i>

00:07.617 --> 00:09.818
So when can you sneak me
into my dad's office?

00:09.939 --> 00:12.140
I wanna get some of his stuff,
if it's still there.

00:12.208 --> 00:13.808
They're from a woman--
B.

00:13.909 --> 00:15.610
"All my love, B."

00:15.678 --> 00:16.911
Who's B?

00:17.013 --> 00:18.747
You and I, we're together,
right?

00:18.848 --> 00:22.017
I shouldn't have done it
with someone like you.

00:22.118 --> 00:23.918
I don't think
you're a nice girl.

00:24.020 --> 00:27.756
Zack Shelby owed me $150,000.

00:27.857 --> 00:29.758
- Where is it?
- Where is what?

00:31.861 --> 00:33.028
I need you
to bring me that money

00:33.129 --> 00:35.864
tomorrow night
at the Seacliff Pier

00:35.931 --> 00:37.198
at midnight.

00:37.299 --> 00:38.666
Can you bring me my money?

00:38.768 --> 00:39.868
Yes.

00:51.414 --> 00:54.382
I need to speak to Sheriff
Romero right away, please.

00:54.483 --> 00:57.485
It's a matter
of life and death.

01:00.322 --> 01:01.856
What is your name, please?

01:01.957 --> 01:03.958
Are you kidding me?
You don't know my name?

01:04.025 --> 01:06.961
Norma Louise Bates.

01:07.029 --> 01:09.631
We need to talk.

01:09.698 --> 01:11.800
He told me to show up
with $150,000

01:11.867 --> 01:13.068
at midnight at the docks.

01:13.135 --> 01:14.636
Okay.
And what did you say?

01:14.737 --> 01:17.005
I said yes,
I would bring him the money.

01:17.106 --> 01:18.940
I mean, he had a gun
to my neck.

01:19.041 --> 01:20.308
I don't have the money.

01:20.409 --> 01:21.889
I don't know
anything about the money.

01:21.944 --> 01:23.611
Okay.

01:23.679 --> 01:25.914
All right.
I'll take care of it.

01:26.015 --> 01:28.650
So what, I'm just
supposed to accept

01:28.717 --> 01:30.018
that you will
"take care of it,"

01:30.119 --> 01:31.152
whatever that means?

01:31.220 --> 01:32.353
Yes, that's right.

01:32.421 --> 01:34.122
- You need to trust me.
- Trust--

01:34.223 --> 01:35.890
that is hard to do.
I'm the one who was supposed to

01:35.958 --> 01:37.718
show up with money
that I know nothing about,

01:37.793 --> 01:39.127
or he's gonna kill
my sons and me.

01:39.228 --> 01:40.628
I mean, pardon me for being
a little concerned

01:40.696 --> 01:42.097
- about what your plan is.
- No harm is gonna

01:42.198 --> 01:43.731
come to you or your sons.

01:43.799 --> 01:46.067
You have my word.

01:46.135 --> 01:47.702
That's comforting.

01:47.770 --> 01:49.771
Yep.

02:13.917 --> 02:15.817
You look kind of pathetic.

02:15.919 --> 02:17.753
Really?

02:17.854 --> 02:19.888
I was just thinking
how glad I am

02:19.956 --> 02:22.691
I don't have to get
all dressed up and go.

02:22.759 --> 02:24.660
What a pain.

02:24.761 --> 02:26.762
You should go.

02:26.863 --> 02:28.563
No one invited me.

02:28.665 --> 02:30.799
And I know that
doesn't do anything

02:30.867 --> 02:32.768
for my pathetic quotient.

02:32.869 --> 02:34.503
Do you want me to go with you?

02:34.570 --> 02:35.971
No.

02:36.039 --> 02:37.105
No, that's silly.

02:37.206 --> 02:38.607
That's more than silly.

02:38.675 --> 02:39.975
That's tragically lame.

02:40.043 --> 02:43.045
Oh, I don't mind.

02:44.948 --> 02:47.182
I'd like to.

02:47.283 --> 02:49.051
Oh, please.
You're just asking me

02:49.118 --> 02:51.086
because I'm friend
and you feel sorry for me.

02:51.187 --> 02:53.221
Well, yeah.

02:55.925 --> 02:58.927
Okay, jerk-off,
I'll go with you.

03:11.574 --> 03:14.576
Here's some French toast left.

03:23.519 --> 03:25.687
I need a gun.

03:25.788 --> 03:27.990
Can you get me a gun
and teach me how to use it?

03:28.057 --> 03:30.525
No.

03:30.593 --> 03:31.893
What the hell
do you need a gun for?

03:31.961 --> 03:34.563
Man.

03:34.597 --> 03:37.032
Abernathy thinks
that I'm meeting him

03:37.133 --> 03:40.102
at the dock at midnight
with 150 grand.

03:40.203 --> 03:41.503
That's what this is about,

03:41.604 --> 03:43.538
the dead body and everything.

03:43.606 --> 03:45.440
He thinks I have the money,
but I don't.

03:45.508 --> 03:47.075
So, you know, I tell Romero.

03:47.143 --> 03:48.410
And you know what he says?

03:48.511 --> 03:49.678
"I'll take care of it."

03:49.779 --> 03:51.046
That's it, nothing else.

03:51.147 --> 03:53.482
Nothing like
how that's gonna happen.

03:53.583 --> 03:55.450
Nothing to make me feel safe.

03:55.518 --> 03:56.685
I think that he is bad,

03:56.753 --> 03:58.153
just like everyone else
around here.

03:58.221 --> 03:59.554
I don't trust him.
I don't trust anyone.

03:59.622 --> 04:00.822
- Oh, come on, Norma.
- Dylan, please.

04:00.890 --> 04:01.823
Please, please, please.
Get me a gun.

04:01.891 --> 04:03.191
Teach me how to use it.

04:03.259 --> 04:04.693
I just wanna feel like
I can defend myself.

04:04.794 --> 04:06.728
I'm sorry...okay?

04:06.796 --> 04:09.164
You and a gun is a bad idea.

05:29.912 --> 05:31.079
Ooh! Sorry.

05:31.147 --> 05:34.716
Yeah, I guess.

05:34.784 --> 05:36.885
Screw off, shithead!

05:53.803 --> 05:54.803
Good morning, Dr. Kurata.

05:55.738 --> 05:56.838
Oh, hello.

05:56.906 --> 05:59.074
It's our session time, right?

05:59.175 --> 06:02.844
Um, you cancelled last week
and never called to reschedule.

06:02.912 --> 06:04.079
Oh, I'm--

06:04.180 --> 06:05.547
there's just so much going on.

06:05.648 --> 06:06.948
I'm so sorry.

06:07.016 --> 06:08.350
Um, can you do it now?

06:08.451 --> 06:09.918
Um...

06:09.986 --> 06:11.653
okay.

06:11.721 --> 06:12.821
Where's Norman?

06:12.922 --> 06:14.723
He's already at school.

06:14.824 --> 06:17.125
Ah. Hmm.

06:17.193 --> 06:19.728
Well, please, come in.

06:19.829 --> 06:21.630
Thank you.

06:25.801 --> 06:28.069
I was wondering if you could
give me some advice

06:28.171 --> 06:30.505
on how to handle stress.

06:32.241 --> 06:34.943
Why are you feeling stress,
Norma?

06:36.612 --> 06:38.380
Mm.

06:38.447 --> 06:41.816
Just...stuff.

06:41.918 --> 06:45.787
Like, normal life stuff.

06:45.888 --> 06:48.890
How has everything
been going with Norman?

06:51.093 --> 06:53.662
It's fine.

06:53.729 --> 06:56.831
Fine--you know,
Norman's such a good boy.

06:56.933 --> 06:58.133
He's not really why I'm here.

06:58.201 --> 07:02.137
Not quite a boy though, is he?

07:02.205 --> 07:05.740
Yeah, I-I guess
he is getting bigger, yeah.

07:07.443 --> 07:10.478
Is it gonna be hard for you
when he leaves?

07:10.546 --> 07:12.380
When he leaves to go where?

07:12.448 --> 07:13.648
College?

07:13.749 --> 07:16.084
Oh, right.
Um...

07:16.185 --> 07:18.453
well, you know,
he'll probably just go locally,

07:18.554 --> 07:20.855
given our money and all.

07:20.923 --> 07:23.992
Hmm.

07:25.661 --> 07:26.761
Let me ask you this.

07:26.829 --> 07:28.697
When you were a little girl,

07:28.764 --> 07:31.866
is this what you thought
parenting would be like?

07:31.934 --> 07:34.569
When I was a little girl?

07:38.040 --> 07:41.643
When I was a little girl, um...

07:45.581 --> 07:48.383
yeah, I don't know.
I don't remember.

07:48.484 --> 07:51.486
Do you remember anything
about being little?

08:01.030 --> 08:03.031
Yeah. Well, yeah,
sure, yeah.

08:03.132 --> 08:05.433
But just, like,
normal, usual stuff.

08:05.501 --> 08:07.002
Well, what were
your parents like?

08:11.107 --> 08:15.076
My dad was very kind.

08:15.177 --> 08:16.845
You know, just like
the kind of guy

08:16.946 --> 08:19.581
who would smile at you
all the time,

08:19.682 --> 08:21.116
no matter what, you know?

08:21.217 --> 08:22.851
You'd--you would feel like

08:22.952 --> 08:26.121
he would just
take care of everything.

08:26.222 --> 08:30.091
Um, my mom...

08:30.192 --> 08:34.095
um, she worked in a bakery.

08:34.196 --> 08:37.666
Um, she always
smelled like cookies.

08:37.767 --> 08:39.567
Your parents are gone now?

08:39.669 --> 08:41.469
Yeah, they're both gone.

08:41.570 --> 08:43.538
Do you have any siblings?

08:43.639 --> 08:46.641
No. I am an only child.

08:56.852 --> 08:59.020
Oh, I don't feel well.

08:59.121 --> 09:02.891
Oh, it's my stomach.

09:02.958 --> 09:04.426
I'm sorry.
You know what?

09:04.493 --> 09:05.627
I'm just gonna
have to reschedule.

09:05.695 --> 09:08.697
I'm sorry about that.

09:10.599 --> 09:11.733
Norma, are you okay?

09:11.834 --> 09:12.767
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm fine.

09:12.868 --> 09:15.870
I just need to go home.

09:17.973 --> 09:19.708
Why do you keep calling me?

09:19.775 --> 09:23.712
I told you, I don't have
anything else to say to you.

09:23.779 --> 09:25.613
Just stop bothering me!

09:25.681 --> 09:28.350
I said leave me alone.

09:28.417 --> 09:31.152
You can't say that to me.
Are you k--

09:31.220 --> 09:32.987
Eric, don't call me again.

09:33.055 --> 09:34.589
You hear me?
Don't call me again!

09:34.690 --> 09:36.124
And I mean it!

09:42.498 --> 09:43.765
Are you all right?

09:45.701 --> 09:48.737
Norman.

09:48.838 --> 09:51.740
Norman, did you hear anything
that I was saying?

09:51.841 --> 09:54.542
No, not really. No.

09:54.610 --> 09:55.977
Well, if you did, please--

09:56.045 --> 09:59.381
please just forget it.

09:59.482 --> 10:01.583
Uh, I was just coming
to tell you

10:01.684 --> 10:04.386
I definitely don't wanna
try and publish my story.

10:04.487 --> 10:05.954
Wha--uh, because of your mother?

10:06.055 --> 10:07.622
I just don't want to.

10:07.690 --> 10:09.624
Okay.

10:09.692 --> 10:11.693
Yeah, I--

10:11.794 --> 10:14.796
I understand.

10:19.168 --> 10:22.804
Um, please don't
tell anyone about today.

10:25.608 --> 10:27.142
Okay.

10:27.243 --> 10:28.810
Thank you.

10:30.513 --> 10:33.715
I guess this means that
we have a secret now, huh?

10:33.783 --> 10:36.851
You'll keep it for me,
won't you?

10:38.587 --> 10:41.656
- Of course.
- Thank you.

10:41.724 --> 10:43.425
Thank you.

11:17.957 --> 11:20.025
Alex.

11:23.396 --> 11:26.164
I haven't seen you
since my brother's service.

11:30.069 --> 11:33.071
A bit weird--
nothing to bury but a hand.

11:35.675 --> 11:38.110
Whatever.

11:38.211 --> 11:40.212
What the hell
brings you to my--

11:40.313 --> 11:42.614
What happened to your face?

11:44.684 --> 11:48.020
I don't remember.

11:48.837 --> 11:51.204
Okay. We're getting off
on the wrong track here.

11:51.324 --> 11:54.808
It's not a social visit,
Maggie.

11:54.876 --> 11:57.645
I know you did the bookkeeping
for your brother

11:57.746 --> 11:59.213
and Shelby's
little business--

11:59.314 --> 12:02.370
importing girls from Asia
and selling them.

12:02.937 --> 12:05.508
In fact, I've got
all your paperwork.

12:05.628 --> 12:08.688
It's nice and neat.

12:09.006 --> 12:12.626
Did Jake Abernathy
do this to you?

12:12.694 --> 12:14.695
I don't know who that is.

12:14.796 --> 12:16.563
I'm referring to your brother

12:16.665 --> 12:18.592
and Shelby's third partner.

12:20.718 --> 12:23.920
You mean Joe Fioretti.

12:24.021 --> 12:25.955
He drives a black Cadillac.

12:26.023 --> 12:27.623
About 50, blondish hair--

12:27.725 --> 12:31.327
Yeah, that'd be him.

12:31.395 --> 12:33.396
A few days ago, he came looking

12:33.464 --> 12:35.665
for some money
that Shelby ow him.

12:35.733 --> 12:37.667
I don't have it.

12:37.735 --> 12:39.535
He said he was gonna kill me.

12:39.636 --> 12:43.506
And I guess
he finally believed me.

12:43.574 --> 12:47.043
And how'd you contact Fioretti?

12:47.111 --> 12:50.346
He always contacted us
when a shipment was coming in.

12:50.447 --> 12:51.914
So you have no way
to reach him?

12:52.015 --> 12:53.750
- No.
- Anything else?

12:53.851 --> 12:56.853
Any idea where he is right now?

12:56.920 --> 12:59.722
He told me he was running
the same type of thing

12:59.823 --> 13:03.326
in four different ports
up and down the coast.

13:03.394 --> 13:05.962
All right.

13:06.029 --> 13:07.663
What happens now?

13:10.567 --> 13:12.034
To me.

13:15.639 --> 13:18.608
Um, nothing,
if you keep your mouth shut,

13:18.675 --> 13:20.410
or I'll be back.

13:20.477 --> 13:23.279
Okay.

13:23.380 --> 13:26.115
Take care of yourself, Maggie.

13:30.921 --> 13:33.623
Hello, it's Norma Bates.
Yeah, I know I just called,

13:33.724 --> 13:35.591
but I just wanna make sure
that Sheriff Romero

13:35.659 --> 13:37.059
is still having
the house patrolled,

13:37.127 --> 13:40.129
because I haven't seen
a car go by in a while.

13:42.399 --> 13:43.399
Okay, fine.

13:43.500 --> 13:44.867
Yeah, just making sure.

13:44.935 --> 13:46.702
Thank you.

13:46.770 --> 13:48.738
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

13:48.839 --> 13:50.673
I saw the cutest dress
at the vintage store

13:50.774 --> 13:52.642
for the dance tonight.

13:52.743 --> 13:54.777
- You're going to a dance?
- Yeah.

13:54.845 --> 13:56.446
Norman's taking me.

13:56.547 --> 13:58.781
Oh, when did that happen?

13:58.849 --> 13:59.982
Today.

14:00.050 --> 14:01.384
I hope that's okay.

14:01.485 --> 14:02.685
Yeah, no, I'm glad he is.

14:02.753 --> 14:04.587
I just didn't
hear anything about it.

14:04.688 --> 14:05.755
Well, anyway,

14:05.856 --> 14:09.325
tell me if you like this dress.

14:12.696 --> 14:14.697
I love it.

14:14.765 --> 14:16.365
- Really?
- Yeah.

14:16.467 --> 14:17.907
Will you--will you
hold it up to you?

14:17.935 --> 14:20.736
I wanna see
how it looks with heels.

14:20.838 --> 14:22.872
Oh, it looks amazing.

14:24.608 --> 14:26.375
Is this a spot, or is it just

14:26.477 --> 14:28.311
the nap in the fabric?

14:28.412 --> 14:30.847
Um, it's just the nap
of the fabric.

14:30.948 --> 14:33.783
It's, uh--

14:36.954 --> 14:39.989
it's nothing. That's just
an accident from childhood.

14:40.057 --> 14:44.293
I spilled some hot chocolate
on my leg.

14:44.394 --> 14:45.962
That must've hurt.

14:46.063 --> 14:47.497
Yeah, I don't know.
It was a long time ago.

14:47.598 --> 14:49.265
It was, like, in Florida
in the old house.

14:49.333 --> 14:50.967
I was two years old.

14:51.068 --> 14:53.970
I love the dress!

15:06.517 --> 15:07.850
Hey.

15:07.951 --> 15:10.953
I got something for you.

15:15.526 --> 15:17.527
I changed my mind.

15:21.064 --> 15:22.765
Thank you.

15:22.866 --> 15:24.734
Don't make me regret this.

15:24.801 --> 15:27.537
Mm-hmm.

15:27.604 --> 15:30.640
Come on. I'll teach you
how to shoot it.

15:30.707 --> 15:31.741
So first of all,
you need to learn

15:31.808 --> 15:33.409
how to hold it properly, okay?

15:33.510 --> 15:35.778
Now face the target.

15:35.879 --> 15:37.680
Your feet spread
shoulder-width apart, all right?

15:37.781 --> 15:39.348
You'll have a good,
stable base.

15:39.416 --> 15:41.250
No, shoulder-width apart.

15:41.351 --> 15:42.952
All right.

15:43.053 --> 15:46.989
Okay, now, hands like this.

15:47.057 --> 15:48.291
Okay.

15:48.358 --> 15:49.725
Now gun all the way out, right?

15:49.793 --> 15:51.394
- Your arms locked.
- Mm-hmm.

15:51.495 --> 15:52.728
I want you to aim
at that big bottle

15:52.796 --> 15:55.298
- on the right.
- Mm-hmm.

15:55.399 --> 15:56.532
'Cause you're gonna line up
this bar here

15:56.600 --> 15:57.600
at the end of the barrel,

15:57.701 --> 15:59.368
right there on that notch.

15:59.436 --> 16:00.736
Uh-huh.

16:00.804 --> 16:02.505
And I'm gonna pull back
the hammer.

16:03.974 --> 16:05.641
I didn't say shoot!

16:05.709 --> 16:07.310
Did I say shoot?

16:07.411 --> 16:09.579
Well, I had the bottle
in the sights.

16:09.680 --> 16:11.320
You don't shoot
until I tell you to shoot.

16:11.348 --> 16:12.515
Well, why'd I miss?

16:12.616 --> 16:13.983
Because it takes a while.

16:14.084 --> 16:15.518
Are you gonna wait
until I tell you

16:15.619 --> 16:17.386
- to pull the trigger this time?
- Okay!

16:17.454 --> 16:19.455
Okay, yes.

16:19.523 --> 16:20.623
So what kind of a job
do you have

16:20.724 --> 16:23.726
that you're carrying a gun?

16:25.796 --> 16:28.798
- I guard stuff.
- What kind of stuff?

16:30.901 --> 16:32.768
Weed. Pot fields.

16:32.869 --> 16:34.470
I don't like that!

16:35.639 --> 16:37.974
Norma, do you see?

16:38.075 --> 16:39.675
- Do you see this right now?
- What?

16:39.776 --> 16:41.644
No, this is exactly why
I didn't tell you.

16:42.980 --> 16:44.580
I-I don't need you passing judgment

16:44.681 --> 16:46.415
on me or anything that I do.

16:46.516 --> 16:48.017
Okay, I am 22 years old.
I'm an adult.

16:48.085 --> 16:51.020
Eh, barely.

16:51.088 --> 16:52.822
Who's not the adult?

16:52.889 --> 16:54.457
I'm trying to teach you
how to use a firearm,

16:54.524 --> 16:56.258
and you're doing
whatever the hell you want.

16:56.360 --> 16:57.727
This is serious shit!

16:57.828 --> 16:59.328
Okay, okay.

16:59.429 --> 17:00.630
I will follow your instructions,
I promise.

17:00.731 --> 17:02.198
I--okay.

17:02.265 --> 17:05.434
Okay, get--
get in the right stance.

17:05.535 --> 17:06.935
And then once
you have a good aim...

17:06.970 --> 17:08.671
Mm-hmm.

17:08.739 --> 17:10.873
I want you
to squeeze the trigger.

17:10.973 --> 17:12.474
Okay, don't--
don't yank on it.

17:12.541 --> 17:14.542
- Okay.
- Just gently squeeze it,

17:14.645 --> 17:15.678
okay, mom?

17:15.746 --> 17:17.346
Aah!

17:17.446 --> 17:18.614
Look at that.

17:18.714 --> 17:21.884
- Did you see that?
- Son of a bitch.

17:24.354 --> 17:25.688
You called me mom.

17:25.789 --> 17:27.890
- What?
- Yeah.

17:27.991 --> 17:29.558
You haven't done that in, like,

17:29.626 --> 17:32.795
I don't know how long.

17:32.896 --> 17:33.996
Yeah, well,
you have a loaded gun

17:34.097 --> 17:36.298
in your hand, Norma.

17:40.570 --> 17:43.005
I'm so scared.

17:44.908 --> 17:47.376
Yeah, I know.

17:47.477 --> 17:48.511
I know.

17:48.612 --> 17:49.745
But from everything I hear,

17:49.813 --> 17:51.480
Romero's the man in this town.

17:51.548 --> 17:53.068
Okay? So you're gonna
have to trust him

17:53.083 --> 17:55.017
to do what he says.

17:55.085 --> 17:56.519
I know that
might be hard for you,

17:56.620 --> 17:59.522
but that's what
you're gonna have to do.

18:05.295 --> 18:07.970
- You're empty.
- Load it.

18:14.790 --> 18:16.323
Are you Norma Bates?

18:19.995 --> 18:21.162
How can I help you?

18:21.263 --> 18:23.998
Um, I'm Maggie Summers.

18:24.099 --> 18:27.234
My family
used to own this place.

18:27.335 --> 18:30.137
Oh.

18:30.238 --> 18:33.040
Um, I came here
to tell you something.

18:33.141 --> 18:34.408
Yes?

18:34.509 --> 18:38.512
If--if you have that money,
give it up.

18:40.129 --> 18:42.083
Look, I know this guy,

18:42.184 --> 18:44.585
the one you're calling
Abernathy.

18:44.653 --> 18:47.121
Me and my brother Keith
worked with him.

18:47.189 --> 18:51.158
He will kill you.

19:24.426 --> 19:26.193
Hey, Norman.

19:26.294 --> 19:28.028
Hey.

19:28.096 --> 19:31.065
Is Dylan here?

19:31.166 --> 19:33.634
Dylan.

19:33.735 --> 19:35.603
Yeah.

19:35.704 --> 19:37.605
Yeah, I'll get him.

19:37.706 --> 19:39.707
Oh, come in.

19:49.551 --> 19:51.452
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:51.520 --> 19:54.555
This is the stuff
from his desk.

19:56.591 --> 19:58.092
Thank you for doing this.

19:58.193 --> 20:00.394
Yeah.

20:00.462 --> 20:02.997
Hmm.

20:03.098 --> 20:06.300
Well, I'm gonna go
finish my homework.

20:11.540 --> 20:13.507
It was really nice of you
to do this for me.

20:13.575 --> 20:15.976
It's no big deal.

20:16.077 --> 20:18.112
At least you have it now.

20:18.213 --> 20:20.381
Yeah.

20:20.482 --> 20:22.483
Yeah, I'm glad.

20:25.654 --> 20:27.988
Oh, um, I forgot.

20:28.089 --> 20:31.091
I also found this.

20:33.495 --> 20:36.230
Oh, my dad's watch.

20:36.298 --> 20:38.032
Thank you.

20:38.133 --> 20:39.600
Anytime.

20:39.668 --> 20:41.468
Even though we did
almost get shot.

20:41.570 --> 20:44.605
Yeah, that was crazy.

20:44.673 --> 20:47.007
Okay.

20:47.108 --> 20:50.144
Well, this is it.

20:50.212 --> 20:52.580
I won't bug you anymore.

20:52.681 --> 20:54.682
No, you can--
you can bug me.

20:54.749 --> 20:56.383
It's fine.

20:56.484 --> 20:59.486
You can bug me anytime.

21:19.140 --> 21:20.641
Oh.

21:33.421 --> 21:36.490
Mother!

21:36.591 --> 21:39.226
What?

21:39.327 --> 21:40.995
I need some black socks.

21:41.096 --> 21:42.763
Well, did you check
in your drawer?

21:42.864 --> 21:44.999
Oh, it never occurred to me
to look in my drawer.

21:47.035 --> 21:48.469
Well, what am I supposed to do?

21:48.570 --> 21:49.770
I can't go to this stupid dance

21:49.771 --> 21:51.011
wearing white socks
with a suit!

21:51.106 --> 21:52.066
Well, I don't know where

21:52.140 --> 21:53.307
your stupid black socks are!

21:53.408 --> 21:54.568
It's not my fault you decided

21:54.576 --> 21:56.043
to go last minute to a dance!

21:56.144 --> 22:00.547
What am I supposed to do,
darn some socks?

22:00.649 --> 22:03.584
I've got some black socks
he can use.

22:04.586 --> 22:06.153
Hmph.

22:25.073 --> 22:26.273
Listen, mom's
a little stressed out,

22:26.341 --> 22:28.475
so take it easy on her, okay?

22:28.576 --> 22:31.612
Thanks for the tip.

22:31.680 --> 22:34.181
You okay?

22:34.249 --> 22:36.550
I'm fine.

22:36.618 --> 22:38.485
You know, I was only
helping Bradley

22:38.586 --> 22:40.120
because some of her dad's stuff
was at work.

22:40.221 --> 22:41.522
Yeah, whatever.

22:41.589 --> 22:43.190
It doesn't matter to me.
I'm over her.

22:43.258 --> 22:45.259
If you want to go out with her,
go for it.

22:45.327 --> 22:47.161
I'm not going out with her.

22:47.228 --> 22:49.263
No, but you want to.
Who wouldn't?

22:51.066 --> 22:53.067
This is a stupid conversation.

22:53.168 --> 22:55.336
Yeah, all conversations
are stupid.

22:55.437 --> 22:56.937
Just "Blah, blah, blah,"
like rats

22:57.038 --> 22:58.472
trying to find our way out
through a maze,

22:58.573 --> 23:01.942
like it has some purpose
or meaning, but it doesn't.

23:02.043 --> 23:05.612
Okay, now you're
creeping me out.

23:05.714 --> 23:09.283
Just do what you want
as far as Bradley's concerned.

23:09.351 --> 23:12.019
She probably likes you.
You should ask her out.

23:12.120 --> 23:13.220
I should.

23:13.321 --> 23:14.955
Yes, you should.

23:15.056 --> 23:16.357
I'm fine.

23:16.424 --> 23:19.426
I'm completely, 100% over her.

23:28.803 --> 23:30.571
What time is Emma
picking you up?

23:30.672 --> 23:33.207
Soon.
The dance starts at 8:00.

23:33.308 --> 23:34.975
When is it over?

23:35.076 --> 23:37.077
Midnight.

23:47.355 --> 23:50.157
What is it?

23:50.258 --> 23:52.359
Norman,
can I tell you something

23:52.427 --> 23:55.362
that I've never told anybody?

23:55.430 --> 23:57.264
You were never
old enough before,

23:57.365 --> 23:59.666
but I-I think you are now.

23:59.734 --> 24:02.770
Yeah. What?

24:05.240 --> 24:07.608
I grew up in Akron, Ohio.

24:07.709 --> 24:10.310
- That's not what--
- I know.

24:10.412 --> 24:11.945
I-I know I've said
a lot of things,

24:12.047 --> 24:14.014
but this is the truth.

24:14.082 --> 24:15.616
And I want someone to know
the truth about me

24:15.717 --> 24:17.397
in this world,
and I'd like that to be you,

24:17.452 --> 24:19.453
if you're okay with that.

24:19.554 --> 24:23.190
Yeah, of course I am.

24:27.595 --> 24:31.231
My brother used to make me
have sex with him...

24:34.169 --> 24:37.171
when I was, like, 13.

24:39.374 --> 24:42.709
And it went on
until he moved out.

24:47.515 --> 24:49.249
Oh, I know I shouldn't
have told you.

24:49.350 --> 24:52.286
I shouldn't have told you.

24:52.353 --> 24:53.587
It's just you're the person

24:53.655 --> 24:55.389
that I'm closest to
in this world.

24:57.625 --> 25:00.160
I understand, mother.

25:04.466 --> 25:06.533
When I realized
just how messed up that was,

25:06.634 --> 25:08.102
I couldn't tell anyone.

25:08.203 --> 25:10.637
We had so much trouble.
There was no money.

25:10.738 --> 25:13.173
My mom was already checked out
of her body.

25:13.274 --> 25:15.142
My dad was insane.

25:15.243 --> 25:17.945
He was so violent.

25:18.012 --> 25:20.214
I knew that if I told my dad,

25:20.281 --> 25:23.283
he would kill my brother,
so I never told.

25:25.720 --> 25:29.123
One day, when my dad
was supposed to be at work,

25:29.190 --> 25:31.525
my brother
was doing things to me,

25:31.626 --> 25:36.096
and I heard the front door open

25:36.197 --> 25:38.732
and it was my dad,
home unexpectedly.

25:38.800 --> 25:41.401
And I was so scared
that I jumped up so fast.

25:41.469 --> 25:43.403
And the hot iron
fell off the ironing board,

25:43.471 --> 25:46.206
and it hit my leg.

25:51.346 --> 25:54.948
I'm so sorry, mother.

26:08.029 --> 26:09.530
Anyway, you know, it--

26:09.631 --> 26:11.431
it doesn't really matter,
right?

26:11.533 --> 26:14.701
It was a long time ago.

26:16.337 --> 26:17.938
It's just that
I want to tell some--

26:18.039 --> 26:20.541
I wanted someone to know this
about me in case--

26:20.642 --> 26:23.110
in case, um...

26:23.211 --> 26:24.511
oh, I don't know why.

26:24.579 --> 26:28.582
I don't know why.

26:38.493 --> 26:40.394
Hi. Is Norman ready?

26:40.495 --> 26:43.197
Emma, you look beautiful.

26:43.298 --> 26:47.100
Come on in.

26:47.202 --> 26:50.270
Look at Emma!

26:50.371 --> 26:51.772
Norman?

26:58.213 --> 27:00.480
Wow, you look great.

27:00.582 --> 27:02.449
You, too.

27:02.550 --> 27:05.552
You ready to go?

27:26.040 --> 27:29.042
Okay. You two have fun.

27:31.045 --> 27:32.679
You look so handsome.

27:36.784 --> 27:40.053
Okay.
Bye-bye.

27:55.103 --> 27:57.037
Hello?

27:57.138 --> 27:58.658
I just wanted to make sure
you hadn't

27:58.673 --> 28:01.742
forgotten about our appointment
at midnight.

28:03.244 --> 28:04.945
No, I haven't.

28:05.046 --> 28:07.614
Great.
See you then.

I haven't either.

28:58.372 --> 28:59.773
It's not too late to leave.

what you're talking about.

30:47.047 --> 30:48.014
Bradley.
It's pretty obvious.

30:48.115 --> 30:50.350
Oh. That's ridiculous.

30:50.417 --> 30:53.253
No. You know

31:00.494 --> 31:03.963
but you're just too stupid
to know it.

31:06.400 --> 31:08.234
I think I better go.

31:08.302 --> 31:10.870
- Yeah, I'll go with you.
- No, I don't want you to.

31:10.971 --> 31:13.940

okay?

31:47.508 --> 31:49.309
I mean, you, uh--

31:49.410 --> 31:51.778
You took advantage of her

32:52.039 --> 32:55.041
What happened to your eye?

32:56.443 --> 32:57.744
Oh, I got in a fight.

32:57.811 --> 32:59.045
What?

32:59.146 --> 33:00.680

Norman, that's a nasty cut.

Why don't you come to my place,

33:08.422 --> 33:11.924
and I'll clean up your eye,
and I can drive you home.

33:11.992 --> 33:14.060
Yeah, okay.

33:14.161 --> 33:16.362
Okay.

35:05.800 --> 35:09.736
Who are you?

35:10.785 --> 35:12.686
Oh, I'm Alex Romero.

35:12.787 --> 35:14.287
What do I call you?

35:14.389 --> 35:16.723
Abernathy? Fioretti?

35:16.791 --> 35:20.227
I go by a lot
of different names.

35:20.328 --> 35:22.896
Why don't you call me Joe?

35:22.964 --> 35:24.197
All right, Joe.

35:24.298 --> 35:25.966
What happened to
the cute-but-nutty lady

35:26.067 --> 35:27.801
who runs the motel?

35:27.869 --> 35:29.970
She's no longer involved.

35:30.071 --> 35:31.204
You kill her?

35:31.305 --> 35:34.107
Let's just say it's handled.

35:34.208 --> 35:35.308
Is that for me?

35:35.410 --> 35:36.877
I thought we could talk first,

35:37.443 --> 35:39.644
you know,
come to an understanding.

35:39.712 --> 35:41.479
- About what?
- Well, Joe,

35:41.547 --> 35:43.681
if you're gonna
run a business in my town,

35:43.782 --> 35:45.011
I should know about it.

35:45.131 --> 35:49.254
<i>Was</i> running a business--
past tense.

35:49.355 --> 35:52.085
Well, maybe that
doesn't have to be the case.

35:52.519 --> 35:53.919
You had the wrong partners.

35:53.987 --> 35:54.953
Well, it wasn't like I could

35:55.054 --> 35:57.523
put an ad on Craigslist.

35:57.624 --> 35:59.792
How'd you get my money?

35:59.893 --> 36:01.860
Now, that's part of what
you need to understand.

36:01.961 --> 36:04.029
This is my town, Joe.

36:04.130 --> 36:06.098
You want to keep your business
going here,

36:06.166 --> 36:07.499
then you got to go through me.

36:07.600 --> 36:10.469
We make a new deal.
50-50.

36:10.537 --> 36:12.471
That's more than Keith
and Shelby got combined.

36:12.539 --> 36:14.206
That's because
they were idiots.

36:14.274 --> 36:16.775
Going forward,
you're paying me for certainty,

36:16.876 --> 36:18.510
for professionalism.

36:18.611 --> 36:21.547
And to that end, Joe,
I make all the decisions

36:21.614 --> 36:23.849
about who else in this town
is involved.

36:23.950 --> 36:25.117
That's it?

36:25.185 --> 36:26.885
I put a cell number for you
on a card.

36:26.986 --> 36:29.288
It's in the bag.

37:05.892 --> 37:09.228
Not in my town,
you piece of shit.

37:14.267 --> 37:17.269
You can go home now, Norma.

37:24.010 --> 37:27.246
I almost shot you!

37:27.347 --> 37:30.282
When I say "Trust me,"
trust me.

37:37.557 --> 37:40.525
I made you some tea.

37:48.201 --> 37:49.902
That's very nice of you.

37:50.003 --> 37:52.304
Of course.

37:52.372 --> 37:55.374
Let me clean up that eye.

38:00.013 --> 38:03.081
Okay?

38:17.363 --> 38:20.165
You probably shouldn't
tell anyone that you came here.

38:20.266 --> 38:23.101
Don't worry.

38:28.474 --> 38:30.809
Doesn't look bad.

38:30.910 --> 38:33.912
I got most of the dirt
out of it, anyway.

38:37.350 --> 38:40.352
All right.

38:46.292 --> 38:50.295
I'm going to go change quickly.

38:50.396 --> 38:54.733
- Okay.
- I'll drive you home.

38:54.834 --> 38:56.568
Thanks.

39:24.597 --> 39:27.299
What kind of a grown woman
invites a teenage boy

39:27.400 --> 39:29.234
into her house
and changes her clothes

39:29.302 --> 39:30.936
- where he can see her?
- That's not what she's doing.

39:31.037 --> 39:32.771
Of course it is.

39:32.839 --> 39:34.239
No. No, no,
she's trying to help me.

39:34.273 --> 39:35.240
She's trying to seduce you.

39:35.308 --> 39:36.775
That's not true.

39:36.843 --> 39:39.177
Then why doesn't she
close the door?

39:39.278 --> 39:40.779
Because--

39:40.847 --> 39:42.014
Because she knows
you're watching her.

39:42.115 --> 39:44.149
- She does not!
- Of course she does.

39:44.217 --> 39:45.884
She wants you to see her body.

39:45.952 --> 39:48.153
- She wants you to want her.
- Stop!

39:48.221 --> 39:51.857
Norman...

39:51.958 --> 39:54.960
you know what you have to do.

40:19.052 --> 40:20.919
Mother!

40:23.689 --> 40:25.457
Norman?

40:36.936 --> 40:38.537
Norman, what happened?

40:39.279 --> 40:40.680
I don't know.

40:40.781 --> 40:42.615
Emma got upset and had to leave

40:42.716 --> 40:44.016
and Miss Watson
was going to give me a ride,

40:44.084 --> 40:45.102
but the next thing I remember,
I was just

40:45.222 --> 40:47.701
running on the road alone,
trying to get home.

40:59.982 --> 41:03.217
It's okay, Norman.

41:04.838 --> 41:08.207
Everything's all right now,
Norman.

41:08.275 --> 41:11.255
You're home and we're safe.

41:16.116 --> 41:17.870
Everything is good.

41:17.990 --> 41:21.437
Yeah. Everything is good,
Norman, finally.

41:21.557 --> 41:24.991
Everything is good.

41:28.762 --> 41:31.817
Maybe we should
get out of the cold.

41:32.093 --> 41:34.834
Let's go build a fire.
How's that sound?

41:34.935 --> 41:37.837
That sounds perfect.
