WEBVTT

00:01.332 --> 00:03.704
HEY! IRASSHAIMASE!
HEY! IRASSHAIMASE!

00:03.704 --> 00:06.337
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?
REMEMBER THE OTHER NIGHT
WHEN WE HAD SUSHI?

00:06.337 --> 00:08.779
I JUST LOVED THE WAY
THE CHEFS GREETED US,

00:08.779 --> 00:10.781
SO I THOUGHT
WE'D START DOING IT HERE.

00:10.781 --> 00:14.215
HEY! IRASSHAIMASE!
HEY! IRASSHAIMASE!

00:14.215 --> 00:17.088
I LIKE IT.
I HATE IT
MORE THAN ANYTHING EVER.

00:17.088 --> 00:19.320
OH, COOL. THEN WE'LL
JUST DO IT TO YOU.
HMM.

00:19.320 --> 00:21.292
SHOULD I BRING THIS SHIRT
TO COLLEGE?

00:21.292 --> 00:24.024
I MEAN, I'VE BEEN WORKING OUT
A LOT, SO I'M NOT SURE THAT

00:24.024 --> 00:27.027
IT'S OBVIOUS ANYMORE THAT
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE IRONIC.
IT'S STILL PRETTY OBVIOUS.

00:27.027 --> 00:28.759
I'M GONNA MISS YOU THE MOST.
MM.

00:28.759 --> 00:32.063
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE LEAVING IN A WEEK.
MM.

00:32.063 --> 00:35.806
ANDY, DO I LOOK OLD ENOUGH
TO HAVE A KID IN COLLEGE?
NOT UNLESS YOU HAD HIM
WHEN YOU WERE 9.

00:35.806 --> 00:37.508
(whispers) THANK YOU.

00:37.508 --> 00:39.270
AND THEN THEY KISS.

00:41.072 --> 00:42.042
MWAH!

00:42.042 --> 00:43.814
THAT TICKLES.

00:43.814 --> 00:46.046
(laughs)
OH, MY GOD.

00:46.046 --> 00:49.180
YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVED MOST
ABOUT COLLEGE?

00:49.180 --> 00:50.481
OH, JELLY BEAN.

00:50.481 --> 00:52.783
ARE YOU CONFUSING COLLEGE WITH
THAT MANAGEMENT TRAINING COURSE

00:52.783 --> 00:55.786
THAT YOU TOOK
AT THE WAFFLE HOUSE?
FINE.
I DIDN'T "GO TO COLLEGE,"

00:55.786 --> 00:57.788
BUT I STILL USED TO LIKE
TO HANG OUT

00:57.788 --> 00:59.630
AND PRETEND I WAS A STUDENT

00:59.630 --> 01:01.692
AND GO
TO ALL THE AWESOME PARTIES.

01:01.692 --> 01:04.765
I EVEN JOINED A SORORITY,
BUT THE POLITICS DROVE ME CRAZY.

01:04.765 --> 01:06.767
SO KELLY ARCHER GAVE
SUZY WHITLEY'S BOYFRIEND

01:06.767 --> 01:08.269
A... (singsongy) WHOA-OH!

01:08.269 --> 01:11.071
(normal voice) I'M NOT SUPPOSED
TO GO ON HER PARENTS' BOAT

01:11.071 --> 01:13.073
FOR SPRING BREAK? THAT,
MY FRIENDS, IS HORSE CRAP.

01:13.073 --> 01:15.806
SO I PACKED--
LAURIE, SWEETHEART, I THINK YOUR
POINT'S OVER HERE SOMEWHERE.

01:15.806 --> 01:18.109
REMEMBER, THERE WAS SOMETHING
THAT YOU LOVED ABOUT COLLEGE...

01:18.109 --> 01:21.552
OKAY, I'M LOST INSIDE
MY BRAIN AGAIN. (sighs)
OH, JELLY BEAN.

01:21.552 --> 01:24.084
DRINKING GAMES!
I LOVED DRINKING GAMES!

01:24.084 --> 01:26.387
WINE UP, EVERYBODY!
WINE UP!

01:26.387 --> 01:28.088
YAY!
YEAH!

01:28.088 --> 01:29.190
OHH!

01:29.190 --> 01:32.623
(all) OHH!
(Ellie)
ALL RIGHT. GET IT IN!

01:32.623 --> 01:34.865
(all) OHH!
UH-HUH! CHUG IT, LOSER!

01:34.865 --> 01:37.468
(Laurie) OOH!
(Ellie laughs)

01:37.468 --> 01:40.731
BUT DON'T DRINK IN COLLEGE.
YOU'RE NOT OF AGE YET.
IT DOESN'T EVEN LOOK LIKE FUN.

01:40.731 --> 01:43.604
(cheering)

01:43.604 --> 01:46.377
OH, IT'S--IT'S REALLY HARD
TO CHUG PINOT.

01:48.108 --> 01:50.141
MAN, I LOVE FISHING
OFF THE BOAT.

01:50.141 --> 01:53.144
I MEAN, I STILL HAVE TO RUN
OVER TO THE BEACH TO CAST,

01:53.144 --> 01:55.446
PLUS YOU GOTTA WAIT
FOR A BREAK IN TRAFFIC

01:55.446 --> 01:57.588
TO REEL ANYTHING IN...

01:57.588 --> 02:00.291
(chuckles) AND EVEN THEN
YOU GOTTA REAL IT IN QUICK.
I LIKE BEING YOUR SON.

02:00.291 --> 02:02.793
OH, HEY, I GOT A NEW LAPTOP
FOR COLLEGE.

02:02.793 --> 02:05.196
THOUGHT YOU MIGHT WANT
THE OLD ONE.

02:05.196 --> 02:07.198
(laughs) HOT DAMN, BUDDY!
MY FIRST COMPUTER.

02:07.198 --> 02:09.200
YEAH.

02:09.200 --> 02:12.433
HEY, YOU KNOW HOW MUCH
I'M GONNA MISS YOU, RIGHT?

02:12.433 --> 02:15.506
SAME HERE.

02:15.506 --> 02:18.509
(whirring)
WHOO! FISH ON, BABY!
I GOT A BIG ONE!

02:18.509 --> 02:20.371
(horn blares)
WHOA.

02:20.371 --> 02:23.444
NOPE. JUST ANOTHER BUS.

02:23.444 --> 02:27.318
(motor rumbling)

02:28.919 --> 02:31.852
(all) HEY! IRASSHAIMASE!

02:31.852 --> 02:35.826
WHY DO YOU KEEP DOING THIS
WHEN YOU KNOW I HATE IT?
YOU JUST ANSWERED
YOUR OWN QUESTION.

02:35.826 --> 02:38.289
ELLIE, WHY IS TOM
MOWING YOUR LAWN?

02:38.289 --> 02:40.661
HE FEELS BAD FOR ME.
I-I'M NOT SURE WHY.

02:40.661 --> 02:42.933
MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE HE THINKS
THAT YOUR SON DIED.

02:42.933 --> 02:45.796
(chuckles)
SATAN WILL NOW EXPLAIN.

02:45.796 --> 02:48.699
DO YOU GUYS REMEMBER YESTERDAY
WHEN I WAS REALLY UPSET

02:48.699 --> 02:51.642
BECAUSE ANDY THREW AWAY MY LATTE
WHEN IT STILL HAD A SIP LEFT?

02:51.642 --> 02:54.805
I'M STILL MAD ABOUT THAT.
YEAH. I FEEL BAD, TOO.

02:54.805 --> 02:57.308
ANYWAY, TOM CAME UP RIGHT AFTER
AND SAID, "WHO DIED?"

02:57.308 --> 02:59.810
AND I SAID, "STAN," BUT I WAS
TALKING ON MY BLUETOOTH.

02:59.810 --> 03:02.383
I WASN'T TALKING TO HIM,
AND BEFORE I COULD EXPLAIN,

03:02.383 --> 03:04.385
HE STARTED CRYING
AND TALKING ABOUT GOD'S PLAN,

03:04.385 --> 03:06.387
AND THEN HE STARTED
DOING THINGS FOR ME,

03:06.387 --> 03:09.260
AND, WELL, YOU KNOW,
I WENT WITH IT.
YOU'RE OKAY WITH THIS?

03:09.260 --> 03:10.861
I DON'T WANNA MOW THE LAWN.

03:10.861 --> 03:12.863
IT'S, LIKE,
A THOUSAND DEGREES OUT THERE.

03:12.863 --> 03:14.565
ELLIE, NO-LOOK. WHOO!
HELLS, YEAH.

03:14.565 --> 03:17.868
I FORGET YOU EVEN HAVE A KID. I
MEAN, YOU NEVER TALK ABOUT DAN.
STAN.

03:17.868 --> 03:20.871
WHO CARES?
IS THERE ANYTHING WORSE
THAN AN INTELLIGENT WOMAN

03:20.871 --> 03:22.873
WHO SQUIRTS OUT A BABY
AND THEN JUST TALKS

03:22.873 --> 03:24.905
ABOUT EVERY BORING DETAIL
OF ITS LIFE?

03:24.905 --> 03:27.278
ANDY, TELL HIM
WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT THAT.

03:27.278 --> 03:29.840
IT MIGHT BE THE MOST UNSEXY
THING IN THE WORLD.

03:29.840 --> 03:33.444
OKAY, I HEARD WHAT YOU SAID
ABOUT BORING BABY STORIES,

03:33.444 --> 03:35.546
BUT I DON'T CARE. CHECK OUT
THIS MACARONI NECKLACE

03:35.546 --> 03:37.688
THAT TRAVIS MADE ME
WHEN HE WAS 1.
1?

03:37.688 --> 03:39.990
FINE. I MADE IT.
BUT I USED HIS HANDS,

03:39.990 --> 03:42.893
LIKE HE WAS
JUST A LITTLE PUPPET.
HEY, GUYS.

03:42.893 --> 03:44.925
(sighs)
(lowered voice)
HI, TOM.

03:44.925 --> 03:47.227
YOU WANT ME TO GET
YOUR LAWN, TOO, JULES?

03:47.227 --> 03:49.930
(voice breaks) OH, GOD.
THANKS, TOM. IT IS A TOUGH TIME.

03:49.930 --> 03:52.002
I-I CAN'T IMAGINE.

03:52.002 --> 03:54.735
YOU'RE ALL GOING
TO HELL.

03:54.735 --> 03:57.368
SO ARE YOU.
YOU ATE HIS LASAGNA LAST NIGHT.

03:57.368 --> 04:00.941
I ATE DEAD BABY LASAGNA?
AND YOU LOVED IT,
SO PUT ON A SAD FACE,

04:00.941 --> 04:03.314
'CAUSE TONIGHT TOM IS
MAKIN' MEXICAN. (chuckles)

04:03.314 --> 04:05.576
OOH, MEXICAN! YEAH!
(normal voice) OOH! SO GOOD.

04:05.576 --> 04:06.747
MNH.
UNH.

04:06.747 --> 04:08.919
I'M SORRY.

04:11.922 --> 04:14.425
I CAN'T BELIEVE
TRAVIS IS LEAVING HOME.

04:14.425 --> 04:16.427
OH, IT FEELS LIKE
JUST YESTERDAY--

04:16.427 --> 04:18.929
OKAY, I SHOULDN'T HAVE
TO SAY THIS TO A GIRL.

04:18.929 --> 04:20.431
I'M RIGHT HERE.

04:20.431 --> 04:23.864
I CAN'T HELP IT, HONEY. YOU ARE
ROCKING MAJOR CLEAVE TODAY.

04:23.864 --> 04:26.867
(chuckles) TRAVIS USED
TO EAT OUT OF THESE.
OH, BOY.

04:26.867 --> 04:29.870
YOU ARE REALLY GONNA LOSE IT
WHEN HE SPLITS, AREN'T YOU?

04:29.870 --> 04:31.842
NO, 'CAUSE I GOT
A WHOLE WEEK TO DEAL.

04:31.842 --> 04:33.844
I'VE ALREADY STARTED
MY COPING PROCESS.

04:33.844 --> 04:36.347
GETTING NOSTALGIC--DAY ONE.

04:36.347 --> 04:37.748
STARTING TOMORROW,

04:37.748 --> 04:40.050
I'M GONNA SPEND
EVERY WAKING SECOND WITH HIM.

04:40.050 --> 04:43.914
OH. I ALREADY HAVE A LIST
OF STUFF WE'RE GONNA DO.

04:43.914 --> 04:46.957
OH. WHAT'S SO FUN
ABOUT A MOTORCYCLE RIDE?

04:46.957 --> 04:49.960
(chuckles) WHEN I GO TOO FAST,
HE'S GONNA BE AFRAID OF DYING,

04:49.960 --> 04:52.423
AND HE'S GONNA HUG ME
SO TIGHT.

04:52.423 --> 04:53.924
UGH. POOR TRAV.

04:53.924 --> 04:56.296
I KNOW. HE'S SCREWED.

04:57.968 --> 05:01.001
HEY. DO YOU WANT ME TO TEACH YOU
HOW TO USE THAT BAD BOY?

05:01.001 --> 05:04.004
PLEASE. I'VE MOSTLY BEEN
USING IT LIKE A MAGAZINE--

05:04.004 --> 05:05.936
YOU KNOW,
HITTING FLIES WITH IT,

05:05.936 --> 05:07.938
USING IT TO SCRATCH
MY ENGINE ROOM.

05:07.938 --> 05:09.940
YOU SHOULD START A BLOG

05:09.940 --> 05:13.514
AND SHARE YOUR CRACKER LINGO
WITH THE WORLD.
WHAT THE FUDGE IS A BLOG?

05:13.514 --> 05:16.016
A BLOG IS LIKE A DIARY, BUT YOU
WANT EVERYONE TO READ IT.

05:16.016 --> 05:19.019
LIKE, IF YOU GET BAD SERVICE
AT A RESTAURANT, YOU BLOG IT,

05:19.019 --> 05:21.992
AND THEN YOU GET A FREE MEAL
AT THAT RESTAURANT,

05:21.992 --> 05:24.054
BUT THEN YOU WONDER,
DID THEY JUST LURE ME BACK HERE

05:24.054 --> 05:26.857
SO THEY COULD SPIT IN MY FOOD?
SO YOU BLOG THAT,

05:26.857 --> 05:29.760
AND THEN
THEY TAKE YOU TO COURT.
I WISH I COULD TAKE EVERYTHING
IN YOUR HEAD AND PUT IT IN MINE.

05:29.760 --> 05:32.763
ARE YOU SURE YOU HAVE ROOM
FOR ALL HER blink-182 LYRICS

05:32.763 --> 05:36.036
AND HER FASCINATING IDEAS
ON HOMEMADE BIRTH CONTROL?

05:36.036 --> 05:38.839
JUST F.Y.I.--
PLASTIC WRAP IS, LIKE,

05:38.839 --> 05:42.873
93 1/2% EFFECTIVE, SO...

05:42.873 --> 05:45.015
(mouths word)

05:45.015 --> 05:47.878
OH, GOD. THERE'S BARB.
PLEASE SAVE ME.

05:47.878 --> 05:49.950
WHAT? YOU ARE A COWARD!

05:49.950 --> 05:51.452
HI.

05:51.452 --> 05:54.685
WELL, I HEAR YOUR SON
IS HEADING OFF TO COLLEGE.

05:54.685 --> 05:56.857
I ACTUALLY JUST FINISHED
A VERY PRIVATE MEETING

05:56.857 --> 05:59.760
WITH THE DEAN
AND THE CHANCELLOR.

05:59.760 --> 06:01.592
LET'S GO, DEAN.

06:01.592 --> 06:03.894
YOU, TOO, CHANCELLOR.

06:05.996 --> 06:07.998
YOU KNOW,
WHEN TRAVIS WAS A BABY

06:07.998 --> 06:10.000
AND SOMEONE LIKE THAT
CAME UP AND BUGGED ME,

06:10.000 --> 06:13.003
HE WOULD JUST CRY ON COMMAND
AND THEN THEY WOULD LEAVE.

06:13.003 --> 06:15.946
ALL I HAD TO DO WAS GIVE HIM
JUST A LITTLE PINCH.

06:15.946 --> 06:19.049
HE WASN'T CRYING ON COMMAND.
YOU WERE HURTING HIM.

06:19.049 --> 06:22.152
YOU SHUT UP. I'M A GOOD MOM!
OW!

06:22.152 --> 06:24.114
YOU KNOW WHAT STAN DOES

06:24.114 --> 06:26.116
THAT'S EVEN MORE AMAZING
THAN YOUR ABUSE STORY?

06:26.116 --> 06:28.158
ANDY, WE DECIDED.
NO BABY STORIES.

06:28.158 --> 06:29.990
NO, WE DIDN'T DECIDE.
YOU DECIDED.

06:29.990 --> 06:32.493
WHEN I DECIDE,
WE DECIDE.

06:32.493 --> 06:35.626
NOT IN FRONT OF THE GUYS.
I'M GONNA TELL A STAN STORY.

06:35.626 --> 06:37.898
I WOULDN'T.

06:37.898 --> 06:39.500
(mouths word)

06:39.500 --> 06:42.132
(sucks teeth)

06:42.132 --> 06:45.606
SOMETIMES WHEN STAN SMILES,
LITTLE BUBBLES COME OUT.

06:45.606 --> 06:47.608
HOW ADORABLE IS THAT?
(chuckles)

06:47.608 --> 06:48.909
(flatly) SO ADORABLE.

06:48.909 --> 06:51.842
I WILL DECIDE
YOUR PUNISHMENT LATER.

06:51.842 --> 06:54.044
(grunts)
OH, GOSH!

06:54.044 --> 06:56.046
(laughs)
OH, IT'S LIKE
A MOTORCYCLE HUG.

06:56.046 --> 06:57.748
(laughs)
COME ON. TIGHTER!

06:57.748 --> 07:00.521
VROOM, VROOM, VROOM!
SO, MOM...

07:00.521 --> 07:02.022
YEP.

07:02.022 --> 07:03.994
I THINK I'M GONNA LEAVE
FOR COLLEGE TOMORROW.

07:03.994 --> 07:05.696
OH.

07:05.696 --> 07:09.029
OH. WE'RE STILL HUGGING.
COOL. OKAY.

07:09.029 --> 07:10.961
(sighs) I KNOW CLASSES
DON'T START FOR A WEEK,

07:10.961 --> 07:13.664
BUT I JUST--I WANT
TO GET A HEAD START,

07:13.664 --> 07:14.965
YOU KNOW, GET ACCLIMATED.

07:14.965 --> 07:17.968
BY ALL MEANS, YOU SHOULD GO
AND GET ACCLIMATED. (chuckles)

07:17.968 --> 07:20.941
I MEAN, GOD KNOWS, YOU DON'T
WANT TO START COLLEGE OFF

07:20.941 --> 07:23.544
IF YOU'RE NOT ACCLIMATED.

07:23.544 --> 07:26.146
YOU'RE AWESOME.
(chuckles) LATERS!
LATER!

07:27.978 --> 07:32.052
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA LEAVE ME,
ARE YOU, BUDDY?
(coos)

07:32.052 --> 07:35.025
OW! YOU USED TO DO THAT
TO YOUR BABY?

07:35.025 --> 07:37.057
IT WAS A LITTLE PINCH.
OW!

07:37.057 --> 07:40.060
в™Єв™Єв™Є

07:48.899 --> 07:51.702
JULES, YOU OKAY?

07:53.073 --> 07:57.748
HONEY... WHY DON'T YOU GO
TO YOUR CRAZY PLACE?

07:57.748 --> 08:00.981
I DON'T WANNA.
COME ON.
IT'LL MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER.

08:00.981 --> 08:03.754
YOU KNOW, TRAVIS WAS BORN
EIGHT DAYS LATE,

08:03.754 --> 08:06.016
SO HE'S ALREADY STOLEN
ONE WEEK FROM ME.

08:06.016 --> 08:09.059
OH, THAT LITTLE BITCH
IS TRYING TO DO IT AGAIN.

08:09.059 --> 08:10.921
WELCOME TO CRAZY TOWN.

08:10.921 --> 08:13.894
HERE.
I GOT HER SOME COFFEE.

08:13.894 --> 08:16.126
THAT'S SO NICE, SWEETIE.

08:16.126 --> 08:17.828
OH, MY GOD.

08:17.828 --> 08:20.601
IS MY PUNISHMENT FOR TELLING
A STAN STORY NO EYE CONTACT?

08:20.601 --> 08:21.672
IT IS.

08:21.672 --> 08:23.904
BUT I LOVE YOUR EYE CONTACT.
I CRAVE IT!

08:23.904 --> 08:26.837
(door opens and closes)
WELL,
THAT'S WHY I TOOK IT AWAY.

08:26.837 --> 08:28.508
(all) HEY! IRASSHAIMASE!

08:28.508 --> 08:31.742
DON'T MAKE ME HATE THE JAPANESE.
HOW YA DOIN'?

08:31.742 --> 08:35.015
(sighs) CRAPPY. I'VE JUST--
I'VE GOTTA SLAP OUT OF IT.

08:35.015 --> 08:38.018
SNAP. IT'S "SNAP OUT OF IT,"
NOT "SLAP OUT OF IT."

08:38.018 --> 08:39.990
"SNAP" DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

08:39.990 --> 08:42.853
HOW IS THIS GONNA GET YOU
OUT OF A FUNK? (chuckles)

08:42.853 --> 08:45.295
I MEAN, BUT THIS... SEE, THAT
GETS YOUR ATTENTION, RIGHT?

08:45.295 --> 08:47.658
REALLY DOES.

08:47.658 --> 08:50.030
JULES, SLAP OUT OF IT.

08:50.030 --> 08:51.732
I WILL.

08:51.732 --> 08:53.734
TRAVIS DOESN'T LEAVE
TILL TOMORROW,

08:53.734 --> 08:56.737
SO THERE'S PLENTY OF TIME
FOR MOTHER AND SON BONDING.

08:56.737 --> 08:59.109
I'M GONNA HAVE
TO WHITTLE DOWN THIS LIST.

08:59.109 --> 09:02.873
LET'S SEE. OH, WE DON'T HAVE
TO FLY A KITE TOGETHER.

09:02.873 --> 09:06.046
I'LL JUST HAVE TO CANCEL
THAT PHOTOGRAPHER.

09:06.046 --> 09:07.718
ALL RIGHT. TRAVIS!

09:07.718 --> 09:09.119
AAH! (gasps)

09:09.119 --> 09:10.881
YOU'RE MINE TODAY.

09:10.881 --> 09:12.723
THIS CAN'T BE GOOD.

09:12.723 --> 09:14.024
OKAY.
(clears throat)

09:14.024 --> 09:15.856
LET'S START CLASS.

09:15.856 --> 09:18.228
NOW WHERE CAN WE
PLUG THIS IN?

09:19.930 --> 09:22.292
OKAY, LET'S START CLASS.

09:22.292 --> 09:25.896
NOW THE INTERNET IS LIKE
A SERIES OF SPIDERWEBS

09:25.896 --> 09:27.898
THAT CONNECTS US
TO EACH OTHER.

09:27.898 --> 09:30.601
OH, EXCEPT THAT
THE WEBS ARE INVISIBLE.

09:30.601 --> 09:32.903
OH,
AND THE SPIDERS ARE NERDS.

09:32.903 --> 09:35.706
OOH. LOOK AT 'EM ALL.

09:35.706 --> 09:37.708
OKAY, THERE YOU GO.
YOU'RE ONLINE.

09:37.708 --> 09:39.710
NOW I ASSUME
YOU KNOW SOME BASICS,

09:39.710 --> 09:43.854
LIKE IF THE FONT IS TOO SMALL,
YOU JUST ENLARGE IT.
MAKE BIG.

09:43.854 --> 09:45.155
REALLY?

09:45.155 --> 09:48.088
OH, DO YOU REMEMBER
THIS LITTLE BEAR?

09:48.088 --> 09:50.590
(chuckles) OH, IT'S SO CUTE.
YOU LOVED IT.

09:50.590 --> 09:52.592
(sniffs)
OH! DOESN'T SMELL GOOD.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.094
(chuckles)
SWEET.

09:54.094 --> 09:55.996
EH.

09:55.996 --> 09:58.598
WHAT?
WE JUST SPENT THE LAST HOUR
SIFTING THROUGH A SHOE BOX

09:58.598 --> 10:01.001
CONTAINING A LOCK OF HAIR
FROM MY FIRST HAIRCUT,

10:01.001 --> 10:02.703
ALL MY BABY TEETH,

10:02.703 --> 10:05.706
AND SOMETHING THAT LOOKED LIKE
A PIECE OF DRIED APRICOT.

10:05.706 --> 10:07.978
IT'S EITHER A PART
OF HIS UMBILICAL CORD,

10:07.978 --> 10:09.980
OR THE TIP OF HIS--

10:09.980 --> 10:12.813
UMBILICAL CORD. LET'S JUST
STICK WITH UMBILICAL CORD.

10:12.813 --> 10:16.386
OH, WELL, ONLY MOMMY KNOWS.
(clicks tongue)
JULES,
MAKE ELLIE LOOK AT ME.

10:16.386 --> 10:17.988
ELLIE.
NO.

10:17.988 --> 10:20.050
I GAVE IT A SHOT.
OKAY. LET'S GO, TRAV.

10:20.050 --> 10:22.853
WHERE ARE WE GOING?
OH. WE'RE GOING TO GET
MATCHING TOE RINGS.

10:22.853 --> 10:24.855
(chuckles)
MAYBE I'LL JUST STAY HERE,

10:24.855 --> 10:26.857
PLAY WITH MY UMBILICAL CORD.
LET'S GO.

10:26.857 --> 10:30.060
(door opens and closes)
OH. COME ON! JUST GIMME
A TASTE! I'M TWEAKIN'.

10:30.060 --> 10:32.062
SINCE YOU WON'T ACCEPT
YOUR PUNISHMENT,

10:32.062 --> 10:35.265
YOU WILL NOW WATCH WHILST
I GIVE EYE CONTACT TO...

10:35.265 --> 10:38.168
(deep voice) ANOTHER MAN.

10:38.168 --> 10:39.870
(whispers) OH, NO.

10:39.870 --> 10:43.744
HOW DO YOU LIKE IT,
DIME EYES?
IT'S COLD.

10:43.744 --> 10:46.346
BRR.
I CAN'T LOOK AWAY.

10:46.346 --> 10:48.648
AND HE GETS IT...

10:48.648 --> 10:50.220
ALL...

10:50.220 --> 10:51.982
THE WAY...

10:51.982 --> 10:55.155
OUT.

10:55.155 --> 10:57.227
(exhales deeply) WHOO.

10:57.227 --> 11:00.090
(door opens and closes)
IT'S LIKE A-A GHOST
PASSED THROUGH ME.

11:00.090 --> 11:02.662
THE ONLY WAY I'M GONNA
GET THIS TO END IS

11:02.662 --> 11:04.965
IF I CAN GET STAN TO DO
SOMETHING SO AMAZING,

11:04.965 --> 11:07.798
SHE CAN'T HELP
BUT TELL A STORY ABOUT IT.
LIKE WHAT?

11:07.798 --> 11:10.100
WE CAN GET HIM TO PEE
ON YOU.

11:10.100 --> 11:12.272
KEEP SPITBALLING.
HOW ABOUT ON YOUR SHOES?

11:12.272 --> 11:14.074
SLAP OUT OF IT!

11:14.074 --> 11:17.077
OOH! WE'LL GET HIM TO WALK
FOR THE FIRST TIME.

11:19.049 --> 11:21.982
THIS'LL WORK.

11:26.686 --> 11:27.988
MNH.

11:27.988 --> 11:31.021
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS IS
OUR LAST FAMILY DINNER.

11:31.021 --> 11:33.964
ARE WE PLAYING TAG?
IT'S JUST A MOM TOUCH.

11:33.964 --> 11:36.967
(glasses clink)
I'VE GOTTA BANK SOME.
OH, I FORGOT TO GET GARLIC.

11:36.967 --> 11:39.830
DO YOU WANT TO GO
TO THE STORE WITH ME?

11:39.830 --> 11:42.032
NOT AFTER LAST TIME
WE WENT OUT.

11:42.032 --> 11:43.934
(engine rumbling)

11:43.934 --> 11:46.937
OH, MY GOD. ARE YOU EVEN
WATCHING WHERE YOU'RE GOING?!

11:46.937 --> 11:48.438
I LOVE YOU, TOO!

11:48.438 --> 11:50.981
AAH!

11:50.981 --> 11:53.213
YOU'RE ALIVE, YOU BIG BABY.

11:53.213 --> 11:56.216
THIS IS A FAMILY DINNER.
WHERE THE HELL IS YOUR DAD?

11:58.388 --> 12:00.150
I LOVE THE WEB. I MEAN,

12:00.150 --> 12:03.153
LOOK AT THIS LITTLE KITTY
RIGHT HERE PLAY THE PIANO.

12:03.153 --> 12:05.155
(chuckles) HE'S JUST LIKE
BRUCE HORNSBY.

12:05.155 --> 12:08.028
AND HAVE YOU EVER HEARD
OF THE TERM "NIP-SLIP"?

12:08.028 --> 12:11.101
BOBBY! IT'S A LAURIE KELLER
SIGNATURE MOVE.

12:11.101 --> 12:14.164
I JUST DROP MY SHOULDER,
LIKE SO...

12:15.505 --> 12:18.268
YOU'RE WELCOME, NERDS.

12:18.268 --> 12:20.270
SO WHEN I PULL ON THE LINE,

12:20.270 --> 12:23.743
STAN WILL STAND UP
AND WALK LIKE--
LIKE A PUPPET
WITH A REALLY BAD FATHER?

12:23.743 --> 12:25.745
LIKE A BABY
TAKING HIS FIRST STEPS.

12:25.745 --> 12:27.747
WHEN ELLIE SEES IT
ON THE MONITOR,

12:27.747 --> 12:29.749
SHE'LL HAVE TO RUSH OUT
AND TELL EVERYONE.

12:29.749 --> 12:32.983
PERFECT PLAN, HUH?
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
HOW DUMB YOU ARE, DO YOU?

12:32.983 --> 12:35.285
(Andy) UH... OH-HO!

12:35.285 --> 12:38.528
YEAH! (laughs)
THINK ELLIE WILL BUY IT?

12:38.528 --> 12:41.391
I DON'T KNOW. ELLIE?
NO.

12:41.391 --> 12:44.935
BABE, COME ON. IT'S--IT...
(sighs) IT'S NOT THAT BAD.

12:44.935 --> 12:47.467
WHO WOULD EVER BELIEVE THIS?

12:49.940 --> 12:51.942
GHOST BABY.

12:53.974 --> 12:57.447
WELL, WE FINISHED ALL THE STEAK,
SO WHEN YOUR DAD SHOWS UP,

12:57.447 --> 13:00.510
I GUESS I'LL HAVE
TO GIVE HIM DEAD BABY TACOS.
(exhales deeply and chuckles)
I'M PROBABLY GONNA HEAD OUT.

13:00.510 --> 13:02.983
IT'S MY LAST NIGHT IN TOWN,

13:02.983 --> 13:06.256
SO I'M GONNA GO MEET UP
WITH THE BOYS AND RAGE.

13:06.256 --> 13:08.258
(sighs)
WE'RE GOING TO GET FROYO.

13:08.258 --> 13:11.191
I'M GLAD I GET
TO START OVER IN COLLEGE.

13:11.191 --> 13:14.194
I'LL COME WITH.
YEAH, THAT SOUNDS SUPER FUN,
BUT, TELL YOU WHAT,

13:14.194 --> 13:16.466
I'M GONNA DO MY OWN THING
TONIGHT,

13:16.466 --> 13:19.469
AND THEN YOU AND I CAN HOP
BACK ON THE CRAZY TRAIN

13:19.469 --> 13:22.472
IN THE MORNING. (chuckles)
(chuckles) YOU CAN'T GET OFF
THE CRAZY TRAIN.

13:22.472 --> 13:23.974
THERE'S NO STOPS. (chuckles)

13:23.974 --> 13:26.376
THAT'S
WHAT MAKES IT SO CRAZY.

13:26.376 --> 13:28.078
YOU'RE KINDA SMOTHERING ME.

13:28.078 --> 13:30.981
WITH LOVE.
IT DOESN'T COUNT.

13:30.981 --> 13:35.085
IT'S STILL KIND OF ANNOYING.
I'M SORRY I'M BEING
SO ANNOYING. (chuckles)

13:35.085 --> 13:38.048
I HOPE YOU ENJOYED YOUR MEAL
AND ALL THE CLOTHES

13:38.048 --> 13:41.421
THAT I'VE BOUGHT YOU
SINCE YOU WERE BORN.
OH, HERE COMES THE GUILT TRIP.

13:41.421 --> 13:45.095
OH, MY GOD.
YOU ARE SO SELFISH.
NO, I'M NOT BEING SELFISH.
YOU ARE.

13:45.095 --> 13:46.526
HEY.
(both) IRASSHAIMASE!

13:46.526 --> 13:48.528
IF I'M SUCH A BURDEN--
YOU'RE ALREADY PACKED.

13:48.528 --> 13:50.560
WHY DON'T YOU JUST GO?
WHOA, JULES.

13:50.560 --> 13:52.963
DID SOMEONE ASK YOU
TO JUMP IN?
YEAH, YOU'RE DOIN' GREAT.

13:52.963 --> 13:55.605
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?
YOU WANT ME TO LEAVE?
I DON'T CARE.

13:55.605 --> 13:57.107
OKAY, FINE.
FINE!

13:57.107 --> 13:59.069
TAKE IT EASY.

13:59.069 --> 14:01.111
YEAH,
SEE YA AROUND, DUDE.

14:01.111 --> 14:03.143
(tires screech)

14:04.844 --> 14:07.847
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUMP IN?

14:17.527 --> 14:19.459
HI.
HEY.

14:19.459 --> 14:21.461
AM I A FREAK FOR SLEEPING
IN TRAV'S BED

14:21.461 --> 14:24.134
ON HIS FIRST NIGHT AWAY?

14:24.134 --> 14:27.337
NO. YOU'RE A FREAK FOR WEARING
HIS T-SHIRT AS A NIGHTGOWN.

14:27.337 --> 14:29.339
WELL,
IT SMELLS JUST LIKE HIM.

14:29.339 --> 14:32.903
IT'S A COMBINATION
OF SELF-DOUBT AND LAVENDER.

14:32.903 --> 14:35.275
HE USES MY BODY WASH.

14:35.275 --> 14:38.348
MM-HMM. HE'S GONNA BE
A REAL ALPHA MALE IN THE DORMS.

14:38.348 --> 14:40.050
HE JUST LEFT.

14:40.050 --> 14:43.053
HE'S PROBABLY HAVING
THE TIME OF HIS LIFE.

14:46.216 --> 14:48.058
HI. ARE YOU MY ROOMMATE?

14:48.058 --> 14:50.060
I'M TRAVIS.
I'M NOT A PERV OR ANYTHING.

14:50.060 --> 14:53.093
I MEAN, THIS ISN'T SOME,
LIKE, STRANGE GIRL'S PANTIES.

14:53.093 --> 14:56.096
THIS IS JUST
MY MOM'S HAIR SCRUNCHIE.
THAT'S GONNA BE MY BED.

14:56.096 --> 14:58.298
YEP.

14:58.298 --> 15:01.401
YOU KNOW WHO ELSE I'M MAD AT?
GOD, I HOPE IT'S ME.

15:01.401 --> 15:03.103
THERE IS ONE PERSON
THAT COULD'VE

15:03.103 --> 15:04.935
STOPPED THIS
FROM HAPPENING.

15:04.935 --> 15:07.377
(laughs)
LOOK AT THAT!

15:07.377 --> 15:09.909
DID THE WORLD JUST END?

15:11.281 --> 15:15.215
(high-pitched voice) MOMMY,
I KNOW YOU'RE MAD AT DADDY,

15:15.215 --> 15:17.187
SO I KICKED HIM
IN THE NUTS. BOOM!

15:17.187 --> 15:19.289
I'M GLAD YOU FIND THIS
TO BE SO FUNNY.

15:19.289 --> 15:21.992
(sighs, normal voice)
YOU--YOU CAN'T STAY MAD AT ME

15:21.992 --> 15:24.054
FOR WANTING TO BRAG
ABOUT OUR SON,

15:24.054 --> 15:27.958
AND HONESTLY, IT'S
A LITTLE WEIRD THAT YOU DON'T.
I WANT TO TELL PEOPLE
ABOUT EVERY MOMENT WITH STAN--

15:27.958 --> 15:30.260
HOW HE BLOWS KISSES
IN HIS SLEEP

15:30.260 --> 15:32.462
AND HE SCARES HIMSELF
WHEN HE SNEEZES.

15:32.462 --> 15:35.465
DO YOU REMEMBER THE TIME
HE POOPED IN YOUR MOM'S PURSE?

15:35.465 --> 15:38.568
I MEAN, I HAD TO HOLD IT
FOR HIM, BUT STILL.

15:38.568 --> 15:41.371
(laughs) THAT WAS AMAZING.
LET'S GO TELL EVERYBODY.

15:41.371 --> 15:44.274
"A WOMAN WHO JUST TALKS
ABOUT HER BABY

15:44.274 --> 15:46.977
MAY BE THE UNSEXIEST THING
IN THE WORLD."

15:46.977 --> 15:49.249
WHO SAID THAT?

15:49.249 --> 15:51.181
BEN VEREEN?

15:51.181 --> 15:53.253
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT...
ELLIE.

15:53.253 --> 15:55.385
(door closes)
(high-pitched voice)
DADDY, WHO'S BEN VEREEN?

15:55.385 --> 15:57.287
(normal voice) A VERY TALENTED
SINGER AND DANCER

15:57.287 --> 16:00.460
WHO GOT HIT BY A CAR.
(high-pitched voice) IS HE OKAY?

16:00.460 --> 16:02.032
(normal voice)
YEAH, I THINK HE'S ALL RIGHT.

16:02.032 --> 16:04.034
BOBBY, IF YOU HAD BOTHERED
TO SHOW UP TO DINNER,

16:04.034 --> 16:07.037
THEN TRAVIS AND I WOULD NOT
HAVE GOTTEN INTO A FIGHT,

16:07.037 --> 16:10.040
AND WE WOULD'VE HAD
THE PERFECT GOOD-BYE.
I HAD AN AWESOME GOOD-BYE
WITH TRAVIS YESTERDAY.

16:10.040 --> 16:12.142
HE GAVE ME THIS COMPUTER,

16:12.142 --> 16:14.644
AND THEN WE HAD ONE OF
THOSE GOOD, SOLID MAN-MOMENTS

16:14.644 --> 16:16.646
WHERE EVERYTHING GETS SAID
BUT NOBODY'S TALKIN'.

16:16.646 --> 16:19.709
I CALL IT A "NON-VERSATION."
DO YOU THINK I WANTED

16:19.709 --> 16:23.053
TO SPEND ALL DAY LEARNING
HOW TO USE THIS DEMON BOX?

16:23.053 --> 16:26.316
I'M HOOKED
ON ADORABLE ANIMAL VIDEOS.
(Laurie) IT'S TRUE, JULES,
AND YOU KNOW THAT BOBBY'S

16:26.316 --> 16:29.019
ONE OF THOSE EASILY DISTRACTIBLE
TYPES LIKE--OH, MY GOD!

16:29.019 --> 16:31.661
THERE IS A VIDEO OF A CHICKEN
MAKING CHANGE FOR A DOLLAR.

16:31.661 --> 16:34.164
LOOK, I'M NOT DOING THIS
FOR FUN.

16:34.164 --> 16:37.327
I'M LEARNING THE INTERNET
SO I CAN E-MAIL TRAV.

16:37.327 --> 16:40.330
LOOK, I KNOW THIS IS HARD
FOR YOU, JULES,

16:40.330 --> 16:43.073
BUT IT'S HARD ON ALL OF US.
I'M OKAY.

16:43.073 --> 16:45.075
HELL, IT'S PROBABLY TOUGHEST
ON TRAV.

16:45.075 --> 16:47.537
THIS IS HIS FIRST TIME EVER
ON HIS OWN,

16:47.537 --> 16:49.539
AND WITH ALL THOSE STRANGERS
AND WHATNOT,

16:49.539 --> 16:53.083
AND HE'S PROBABLY TERRIFIED THAT
HE'S NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO, UH,

16:53.083 --> 16:56.146
YOU KNOW... WHAT THE HELL IS
THE WORD I'M LOOKIN' FOR?
ACCLIMATE.

16:56.146 --> 16:59.119
MM.
I'M A BAD MOM.

16:59.119 --> 17:00.790
NO.

17:00.790 --> 17:03.623
I SURE AM GONNA MISS
THAT LITTLE WEIRDO.

17:03.623 --> 17:04.724
BOBBY.

17:04.724 --> 17:06.196
HMM?

17:06.196 --> 17:08.198
HE'S ONLY 20 MINUTES AWAY.

17:08.198 --> 17:11.561
HEY.
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU.

17:11.561 --> 17:14.033
I JUST CAME TO HANG
WITH MY FRIENDS.

17:14.033 --> 17:17.407
OH. AND THEY'RE NOT HERE YET?
(mutters mockingly)

17:17.407 --> 17:20.410
(chuckles) YOU KNOW
WHAT WE SHOULD DO RIGHT NOW?

17:20.410 --> 17:24.374
WE SHOULD TELL THESE GUYS
A STAN STORY TOGETHER.

17:24.374 --> 17:28.278
OH, EXCUSE US FOR A SECOND.
(imitates gunshot)
(imitates gunshot)

17:28.278 --> 17:30.450
(gurgles) MURDER-SUICIDE.

17:30.450 --> 17:32.282
WE MADE A PACT.

17:32.282 --> 17:36.286
IF ONLY. DO YOU NOT GET WHAT
A SLIPPERY SLOPE THIS IS FOR ME?

17:36.286 --> 17:38.288
IF I TELL ONE STAN STORY,

17:38.288 --> 17:40.290
I'M GONNA HAVE TO TELL
A HUNDRED,

17:40.290 --> 17:42.292
AND THEN TOMORROW
I'M GONNA WAKE UP

17:42.292 --> 17:45.595
WITH A SENSIBLE MOM HAIRCUT
AND JEANS UP TO MY ARMPITS.

17:45.595 --> 17:48.568
BABE, YOU ARE WAY TOO NASTY
AND SELF-INVOLVED

17:48.568 --> 17:51.070
TO EVER BE
A PATHETIC MOMMY TYPE.

17:51.070 --> 17:54.073
REALLY?
YES! GUYS, BACK ME UP.

17:54.073 --> 17:57.707
YOU LIED ABOUT YOUR OWN KID'S
DEATH TO GET FREE FOOD.

17:57.707 --> 18:00.250
I THOUGHT
ONLY MY MOM DID THAT.

18:00.250 --> 18:03.683
YOU'RE NOT JUST SAYING THAT
TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER?

18:03.683 --> 18:08.158
I WOULD NEVER SAY ANYTHING
TO MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER.
I DREAD EVERY MINUTE
WE SPEND TOGETHER.

18:08.158 --> 18:09.459
THEY MEAN IT...

18:09.459 --> 18:11.090
AND SO DO I.

18:11.090 --> 18:12.792
THANKS, ANDY.

18:12.792 --> 18:14.524
THANKS, GUYS.

18:14.524 --> 18:16.326
(blows raspberry)
SUCK IT, MOM JEANS.

18:16.326 --> 18:19.199
SO, DID YOU COME HERE
TO YELL AT ME SOME MORE?

18:19.199 --> 18:21.271
NO, BUT WHEN YOU USE
THAT SMART-ASS TONE,

18:21.271 --> 18:23.273
YOU'RE KIND OF ASKING
FOR IT.

18:23.273 --> 18:26.776
LOOK, I'M SORRY. I JUST--
I NEVER STOPPED TO THINK

18:26.776 --> 18:29.439
THAT LEAVING MIGHT BE
REALLY HARD ON YOU, TOO.

18:29.439 --> 18:32.442
I MEAN, IT'S A TRILLION TIMES
HARDER FOR ME... (chuckles)

18:32.442 --> 18:34.444
BUT IT'S NOT A CONTEST,
BECAUSE IF IT WAS,

18:34.444 --> 18:37.447
I WOULD WIN, AND THEN
THAT'S NOT FAIR TO YOU.

18:37.447 --> 18:38.788
MOM...

18:38.788 --> 18:42.322
I'VE BEEN AFRAID
OF THIS MOMENT FOR SO LONG,

18:42.322 --> 18:44.824
BUT I KNOW I RAISED
SUCH A GREAT KID.

18:44.824 --> 18:46.896
WE RAISED A GREAT KID.

18:46.896 --> 18:48.898
MEH.
MM.

18:48.898 --> 18:53.363
TRAVIS, I-I NEVER EXPECTED
SOME DRAMATIC GOOD-BYE.

18:53.363 --> 18:55.365
I JUST THOUGHT
THAT WE'D HUG,

18:55.365 --> 18:57.367
AND THEN I'D WAVE,

18:57.367 --> 18:59.869
AND THEN
YOU'D LOOK BACK AT ME

18:59.869 --> 19:01.911
WITH SOME MEANINGFUL GLANCE

19:01.911 --> 19:05.415
THAT JUST KIND OF SUMMED UP
OUR WHOLE RELATIONSHIP.

19:05.415 --> 19:09.919
OH, I HATE THAT I SPOILED
THIS WHOLE THING.

19:09.919 --> 19:12.882
AND NOW I CAN NEVER GET
THAT GOOD-BYE BACK.

19:12.882 --> 19:17.527
WELL, YOU DO ONLY LIVE
20 MINUTES AWAY.

19:17.527 --> 19:20.530
(Rogue Wave's "Eyes" playing)

19:24.163 --> 19:28.938
в™Є MISSED THE LAST TRAIN HOME в™Є

19:30.800 --> 19:33.443
в™Є BIRDS PASS BY в™Є

19:33.443 --> 19:37.477
в™Є TO TELL ME
THAT I'M NOT ALONE в™Є

19:37.477 --> 19:39.849
в™Є WELL, I'M PUSHING MYSELF
TO FINISH THIS PART в™Є

19:39.849 --> 19:41.851
GRAB STAN.
WE'RE GONNA MISS TRAVIS.

19:41.851 --> 19:44.614
OH, MY GOSH. ANDY, LOOK.

19:44.614 --> 19:47.186
в™Є ONE THING I'M MISSING в™Є

19:47.186 --> 19:48.918
в™Є IS IN YOUR EYES в™Є

19:48.918 --> 19:50.520
в™Є IN YOUR EYES в™Є

19:50.520 --> 19:53.593
в™Є IN YOUR EYES в™Є

19:53.593 --> 19:54.894
в™Є IN YOUR EYES в™Є

19:54.894 --> 19:56.596
в™Є IN YOUR EYES в™Є

19:56.596 --> 19:58.298
в™Є IN YOUR EYES в™Є

20:00.800 --> 20:07.206
в™Є HAVE YOU SEEN THIS FILM? в™Є

20:07.206 --> 20:09.208
(thud)

20:09.208 --> 20:10.710
BYE, GUYS.

20:10.710 --> 20:12.211
BYE, TRAVIS.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.213
SEE YA, TRAV.

20:14.213 --> 20:16.846
KEEP IT IN YOUR PANTS,
PORTO.

20:16.846 --> 20:19.249
HEY...

20:19.249 --> 20:20.990
MEANINGFUL GLANCE.

20:20.990 --> 20:23.553
в™Є IN YOUR EYES, IN YOUR EYES в™Є

20:23.553 --> 20:24.994
I LOVE YOU, MOM.

20:24.994 --> 20:27.597
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

20:27.597 --> 20:30.260
в™Є IN YOUR EYES в™Є

20:30.260 --> 20:33.232
(car door closes, engine starts)

20:33.232 --> 20:34.834
в™Є IN YOUR EYES в™Є

20:34.834 --> 20:37.967
в™Є IN YOUR EYES, IN YOUR EYES в™Є

20:37.967 --> 20:40.810
в™Є IN YOUR EYES в™Є

20:44.243 --> 20:46.816
OH! STAN WALKED.

20:46.816 --> 20:49.449
NOW IS NOT THE TIME.
RIGHT.

20:58.928 --> 21:01.631
WELL, THE ONE THING
YOU GOTTA KNOW ABOUT STAN IS

21:01.631 --> 21:03.633
THAT HIS TWO FAVORITE THINGS
IN THE WORLD

21:03.633 --> 21:05.635
ARE HIS BOTTLE AND BANANAS.

21:05.635 --> 21:07.937
THE ONLY PROBLEM IS HE CALLS
HIS BOTTLE "BAH-BAH,"

21:07.937 --> 21:10.640
AND HE CALLS BANANAS "BEH-BEH,"
SO I'M ALWAYS LIKE,

21:10.640 --> 21:13.002
"DO YOU WANT YOUR BAH-BAH
OR YOUR BEH-BEH?"
(mouths words)

21:13.002 --> 21:15.004
OR SOMETIMES I SAY,

21:15.004 --> 21:17.907
"DO YOU WANT YOUR BAH-BAH
AND YOUR BEH-BEH?"

21:17.907 --> 21:20.350
BECAUSE BANANAS
MAKE HIM THIRSTY.

21:20.350 --> 21:23.953
THE ONLY THING I WILL NOT GIVE
HIM AGAIN IS GRAPE JUICE.

21:23.953 --> 21:26.416
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

21:26.416 --> 21:29.819
WE'RE GOING FOR
THE FIRST-EVER QUINTUPLE.

21:29.819 --> 21:32.422
(imitates gunshot) OHH.
(imitates gunshot)

21:32.422 --> 21:35.425
I'M WIPING THE BLOOD OFF.
THAT'S RIGHT. I'M CONTINUING.

21:35.425 --> 21:38.027
WHERE WAS I?
OH. GRAPE JUICE.
