WEBVTT

00:52.313 --> 00:54.445
Hank?

01:10.287 --> 01:11.897
Hello?

01:28.305 --> 01:30.525
-Ah!
- Hey, you! Good?

01:30.568 --> 01:32.179
You know a lot of that

01:32.222 --> 01:36.574
white noise is leftover sound
of the birth of the universe.

01:36.618 --> 01:38.054
Wow.

01:38.098 --> 01:43.103
They call it, uh, cosmic
microwave background radiation.

01:43.146 --> 01:47.542
Man, talk about putting
lipstick on a pig.

01:47.585 --> 01:49.370
-Lipstick? Like what on a what?

01:49.413 --> 01:51.415
Is that a thing?
Is that a saying?

01:51.459 --> 01:54.331
It's a very romantic spin
on radio static.

01:54.375 --> 01:56.681
It wasn't a line, I'm not,
like, feeding you a line here.

01:56.725 --> 01:58.422
That's... that's science.

01:58.466 --> 02:00.685
I mean, science
is beautiful and romantic,

02:00.729 --> 02:03.123
but that's the Big Bang,
I mean that's fact.

02:05.473 --> 02:07.692
What is this place, really?

02:08.824 --> 02:10.695
It's my house.

02:10.739 --> 02:13.785
-I live here.
-No, you don't live here.

02:13.829 --> 02:20.052
No. No, but it's in my... it's
been in my family for, uh, ever.

02:20.096 --> 02:22.664
Wait, this
is my birthday present?

02:22.707 --> 02:26.668
Not the... not the house.
It's what's inside the house.

02:26.711 --> 02:28.148
- Right, okay, all right.

02:28.191 --> 02:30.150
- Oh, my God, you're gonna
be so underwhelmed now.

02:30.193 --> 02:32.239
No, no, I'm not.
I'm relieved, actually.

02:32.282 --> 02:35.198
Sure.
This is gonna be so brutal.

02:48.298 --> 02:51.083
Is this my birthday present?

02:51.127 --> 02:53.303
Well, yeah, it's, uh...

02:53.347 --> 02:57.046
-You know, it's experiential.

02:57.089 --> 03:00.354
You can't...
you can't put a big red bow

03:00.397 --> 03:04.053
on the kind of night
that I have in store for you.

03:04.096 --> 03:07.709
You can't, uh, you can't
unwrap making a memory.

03:07.752 --> 03:09.276
Ah, okay, I see.

03:09.319 --> 03:11.800
So you drag me
through the woods

03:11.843 --> 03:14.237
to the Texas Chainsaw
Massacrehouse,

03:14.281 --> 03:18.981
and I'm supposed to,
what, throw myself at you?

03:19.024 --> 03:21.766
Well, I mean, I got flowers.
Did you see the flowers?

03:21.810 --> 03:23.594
And what was your plan?

03:23.638 --> 03:27.685
You're gonna just kill me or
kill me and eat me afterwards?

03:27.729 --> 03:31.602
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
No, you got it backwards.

03:31.646 --> 03:34.170
I'm gonna eat you first.

04:48.200 --> 04:52.248
Do you bring all
your girlfriends here?

04:52.292 --> 04:55.164
All my girlfriends
are still here.

04:55.207 --> 04:58.036
I told them I'd
bring them a friend.

04:58.080 --> 05:01.257
They're going to love you,
darling.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.346
It's so dark in the attic.

05:03.390 --> 05:05.609
No, come on.

05:05.653 --> 05:08.656
I haven't
brought anybody here.

05:08.699 --> 05:11.354
Do you know anybody else
in fuckin' Barlow

05:11.398 --> 05:13.008
that would've walked
through that grove?

05:13.051 --> 05:16.577
-No.
-No. Just you, though.

05:17.926 --> 05:19.971
Just you.

05:21.538 --> 05:24.498
-That's very sweet.
-Hm.

05:24.541 --> 05:26.935
I hope you brought some wine
to go with that cheese.

05:29.894 --> 05:32.767
-Peanut Noir?
-Yeah.

05:32.810 --> 05:36.379
-That's from Georgia.
-Oh, Georgia.

05:36.423 --> 05:38.338
Where they make
all the best wines.

05:40.601 --> 05:42.254
It worked.

05:42.298 --> 05:45.170
Oh, wait. Do, uh, do your, um,

05:45.214 --> 05:48.870
the swirly, sniffy,
something-something...

05:48.913 --> 05:51.220
-On the peanut wine?
-Yeah, but it's not...

05:51.263 --> 05:53.178
I told you it
wasn't actually peanuts.

05:53.222 --> 05:55.311
Okay. All right.

05:58.053 --> 06:01.970
-It's fruit-forward.
-Sure.

06:02.013 --> 06:05.756
-I smelled grapes.
-Naturally.

06:05.800 --> 06:09.412
-Yeah. Like grape jelly.
-Grapes.

06:09.456 --> 06:12.328
Hints of peanut shells.

06:12.372 --> 06:14.025
It's a peanut butter
and jelly wine.

06:14.069 --> 06:15.375
I knew you were gonna do that.

06:15.418 --> 06:18.029
You're such a fucking snob.
You're such a snob!

06:18.073 --> 06:23.034
-Is it really that bad?
-Yeah.

06:24.427 --> 06:26.995
I think the jar
really opens it up.

06:28.997 --> 06:34.394
It may just be the moment,
but I think it's pretty great.

06:35.743 --> 06:38.180
Well, this is good,

06:38.223 --> 06:40.225
'cause the people
at the peanut wine place,

06:40.269 --> 06:42.097
they talked me into buying
a whole case of this shit.

06:42.140 --> 06:43.141
No!

06:43.185 --> 06:45.100
Oh, yeah! They were
selling it hard.

06:45.143 --> 06:47.624
You've got like 11
more bottles of this.

06:47.668 --> 06:49.800
Drink up. So drink up.

06:53.238 --> 06:54.892
What is this?

06:56.459 --> 06:58.766
-"For Julie."
-Hey, wait. Wait, what is this?

06:58.809 --> 07:01.029
-Hey, what is it?
-Who the fuck is Julie?

07:01.072 --> 07:02.857
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, let me see that.

07:02.900 --> 07:05.860
-Wait.
-That... that's...

07:05.903 --> 07:07.688
That's been in there
for like ten years.

07:07.731 --> 07:13.563
I'm sorry, is this a mixtape
for another girl on my birthday?

07:13.607 --> 07:15.435
-Like eighth grade.
-Is that what this is? Wow.

07:15.478 --> 07:17.611
-You are not playing that!
-I am!

07:17.654 --> 07:20.483
You absolutely will not. Nope.
You are not playing that.

07:20.527 --> 07:22.790
I will take the whole
fucking thing down.

07:22.833 --> 07:28.360
-Come on.
-This is truly experiential.

09:13.465 --> 09:15.772
Darby!

09:19.907 --> 09:21.996
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty!

09:26.609 --> 09:28.872
Where you at, girl?

09:39.404 --> 09:41.624
Okay. You can
open your eyes now.

09:41.668 --> 09:46.629
-Hey, hey, hey!

09:46.673 --> 09:48.979
It's a kitten!

09:49.023 --> 09:52.896
You have a balloon
attached to you. Aw!

09:52.940 --> 09:55.638
-I found him like that.
-With this balloon attached?

09:55.682 --> 09:58.641
-Yeah.
-Do you want this off of you?

09:58.685 --> 10:03.080
You're a mess.
You're a mess, kitten.

10:03.124 --> 10:06.388
Do you like birthday gifts you
have to care for for 20 years?

10:06.431 --> 10:08.477
Do they
live 20 years?

10:08.520 --> 10:11.045
Ah...

10:11.088 --> 10:14.396
Wow, it's gonna
outlast our relationship.

10:14.439 --> 10:17.921
-Fuck. Oh, sleepy baby.

10:17.965 --> 10:22.056
-He's just as lazy as you are.

10:23.405 --> 10:24.580
Should probably
get that thing off him

10:24.624 --> 10:26.103
before he floats away.

10:29.716 --> 10:31.892
Fuck you!

11:01.748 --> 11:03.619
Hey, this is Abby.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.969
I'm not around right now,
so leave a message.

11:06.013 --> 11:08.711
-Hey, baby, it's me.

11:08.755 --> 11:14.717
Um, listen, the mail's really
piling up here, okay?

11:14.761 --> 11:17.546
A bunch of bills and shit,
and I don't know what's paid

11:17.589 --> 11:19.113
or what's been paid, you know,

11:19.156 --> 11:23.813
you're the one that usually
handles all that shit, so...

11:23.857 --> 11:26.990
I got a bunch
of birthday cards too.

11:29.210 --> 11:32.387
Listen, baby.
If you want outta this thing,

11:32.430 --> 11:34.519
you're gonna have to talk
to me sooner or later, okay?

11:34.563 --> 11:40.308
You can't just disappear.
All right?

11:43.050 --> 11:45.226
Also, this is gonna sound crazy,
I know,

11:45.269 --> 11:48.577
but ever since you left
some kinda...

11:48.620 --> 11:52.755
...thing's been comin'
outta the woods every night.

11:52.799 --> 11:56.759
Scratchin' on the door,
tryin' get in the house.

11:56.803 --> 11:58.848
And I know you're probably
just rollin' your eyes,

11:58.892 --> 12:02.156
thinkin' it's just this thing
or that thing, but it's not.

12:02.199 --> 12:07.901
Okay? I know everything
in these woods.

12:07.944 --> 12:10.033
This is, uh...

12:11.948 --> 12:13.776
I don't know.

12:13.820 --> 12:18.259
I don't know, so, just, uh,
give a call, please, would you?

12:19.564 --> 12:21.741
I love you.

12:41.456 --> 12:43.197
Hey, this is Abby.

12:43.240 --> 12:45.634
I'm not around right now,
so leave a message.

12:47.114 --> 12:50.465
Hey, yeah, also I think
that monster ate your cat.

13:04.696 --> 13:06.394
A-ha.

13:06.437 --> 13:09.614
How we doin', Hank?

13:09.658 --> 13:14.054
-You see what he did to my door?
-Blew a hole in it?

13:14.097 --> 13:17.405
What? No! Not a...

13:17.448 --> 13:20.669
No. This shit!

13:20.712 --> 13:23.672
Not the hole.

13:23.715 --> 13:26.196
Yeah, that's a black bear, Hank.

13:26.240 --> 13:29.547
Oh, for God's sake,
it's not a black bear, Shane.

13:29.591 --> 13:32.812
Well, I think that makes
the most sense, don't it?

13:32.855 --> 13:36.816
No, actually, I don't think
that makes any sense, Shane,

13:36.859 --> 13:39.949
that a black bear would walk
past all that fuckin' garbage?

13:39.993 --> 13:41.864
And all this fuckin' cat food

13:41.908 --> 13:44.606
just to come scratchin'
at my door?

13:44.649 --> 13:47.565
No. Black bear'd eat
its own shit

13:47.609 --> 13:49.829
just to have
somethin' in its mouth.

13:49.872 --> 13:51.352
You know that.

13:53.658 --> 13:55.095
You wanna tell me what
happened with that truck

13:55.138 --> 13:57.880
down the road this mornin'?

13:57.924 --> 14:00.927
-Oh.
-He said you fired at him, Hank.

14:00.970 --> 14:03.233
Yeah, well,
he damn near ran me over.

14:03.277 --> 14:05.366
Well, he said you darted
right out into the road.

14:05.409 --> 14:11.154
Well, he's a fuckin' liar.
I was just checkin' the mail.

14:11.198 --> 14:13.853
You always check the mail
with your shotgun, Hank?

14:15.463 --> 14:17.291
Sometimes.

14:17.334 --> 14:20.120
That it, then?

14:22.122 --> 14:23.688
Yep.

14:25.168 --> 14:27.562
Thanks for stopping by, officer.

14:27.605 --> 14:30.434
I stopped
by Jessie's last night.

14:31.827 --> 14:35.048
Hank, they said
they ain't seen ya.

14:36.876 --> 14:41.097
Listen, this thing with Abby,
I know it's hard on you...

14:41.141 --> 14:43.883
What do you know? The fuck
do you know, Shane? Huh?

14:43.926 --> 14:46.581
What do you know
about it? Huh?

14:46.624 --> 14:47.799
Are you talkin' to her?

14:47.843 --> 14:49.279
Did she tell you
to come check on me?

14:49.323 --> 14:53.936
I am just concerned is all.
We're family.

14:53.980 --> 14:54.981
No, we're not.

14:55.024 --> 14:56.852
We sure as fuck
shoulda been by now.

14:56.896 --> 14:59.768
It's been a goddamn decade!

15:02.162 --> 15:05.774
Maybe she got tired
of waitin' around.

15:06.383 --> 15:08.690
Yep.

15:09.821 --> 15:11.693
Well, hey, look, you know what?

15:11.736 --> 15:18.221
You're so, uh... you're
so concerned with me, Shane?

15:18.265 --> 15:21.703
Why don't you tell your sister
next time she calls

15:21.746 --> 15:25.489
and I'm goin' crazy,
I'm goin' crazy without her,

15:25.533 --> 15:26.969
I'm goin' around town
tellin' people

15:27.013 --> 15:31.060
there's a big bad wolf
tryin' to blow our house down.

15:31.104 --> 15:34.934
Everybody's startin' to talk.

15:34.977 --> 15:39.329
Maybe she oughta just
come on home, then.

15:39.373 --> 15:40.852
Hank?

15:40.896 --> 15:42.898
If the big bad wolf
comes by again,

15:42.942 --> 15:45.683
maybe you oughta shoot it
with your camera

15:45.727 --> 15:47.642
instead
of your 12-gauge.

15:47.685 --> 15:49.818
Make a more convincing argument.

15:49.861 --> 15:52.734
Okay.

-Hey, hey.

16:53.403 --> 16:55.405
She has to start screaming,
she's like "What's going on?!"

16:55.449 --> 16:57.320
And I don't wanna say it's
a spider, 'cause I'm not,

16:57.364 --> 16:59.975
like, a little girl, you know,
so I said it was an intruder,

17:00.019 --> 17:02.978
and she ended up getting,
like, more upset with that.

17:03.022 --> 17:04.197
What's up, Bubba?

17:04.240 --> 17:06.373
Oh, hey, Hank, man!
What's goin' on, buddy?

17:06.416 --> 17:07.896
I was just talkin' about you.

17:07.939 --> 17:09.898
I was just telling
Jane here about the time

17:09.941 --> 17:12.988
that you bagged that Sherman
tank lookin' fuckin' buck.

17:13.032 --> 17:14.250
It was down in the Waller

17:14.294 --> 17:16.513
over in Baines Prairies
about two seasons ago,

17:16.557 --> 17:18.646
and I don't think
she fuckin' believes me.

17:18.689 --> 17:20.691
I don't believe
that's English, so...

17:20.735 --> 17:22.650
No, you wouldn't
believe this thing.

17:22.693 --> 17:23.999
It was like an airplane
with a dick.

17:24.043 --> 17:26.088
It was nice!
It was a good get.

17:26.132 --> 17:28.743
-What was its name?
-Val.

17:28.786 --> 17:30.962
Valentine! Valentine.

17:31.006 --> 17:34.314
Yeah. Where is Valentine?

17:34.357 --> 17:37.143
He's home.
He's in the closet.

17:37.186 --> 17:40.189
The fuck is Big Val
doin' in the closet?

17:40.233 --> 17:43.018
Uh, Abby don't like
dead shit on her walls.

17:43.062 --> 17:45.455
Fuck that.
You should bring it here, man.

17:45.499 --> 17:47.457
Put it... put it up
on the fuckin' wall!

17:47.501 --> 17:49.677
That's a goddamn injustice!

17:49.720 --> 17:53.115
We'll put him up on the wall
with the other goofy shit.

17:53.159 --> 17:57.032
Yeah, 'cause the other thing
is they ward off evil spirits.

17:57.076 --> 18:01.036
-Where did you hear that?
-It's like a Indian thing.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.517
-I mean Native American.

18:03.560 --> 18:05.475
Or like Vikings
or some shit.

18:10.437 --> 18:12.526
Whatcha got there, baby?

18:12.569 --> 18:14.963
-The bare necessities.
-I'll take care of it.

18:15.006 --> 18:16.312
What are you,
running out of booze?

18:16.356 --> 18:17.705
It's nothing
you should worry about.

18:17.748 --> 18:19.576
I've seen you drink
the mat juice.

18:19.620 --> 18:21.578
Yeah, it's called
a Gorilla Fart.

18:21.622 --> 18:23.624
Wait, you drink the spill
out of the bar mats?

18:23.667 --> 18:25.756
Yeah, man, free is free.
I got kids.

18:25.800 --> 18:26.975
Wade.

18:27.018 --> 18:29.499
It's the only drink
you'll give me for free.

18:29.543 --> 18:32.633
Jane, pour us two shots
of that 1816, would you please?

18:32.676 --> 18:35.984
-Mm.
-Have some self respect, Wade.

18:36.027 --> 18:39.814
-What's that?
-A little self respect. Come on.

18:39.857 --> 18:43.426
-That's a healthy pour.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:43.470 --> 18:46.125
No, no, no. That's Jane.

18:46.168 --> 18:48.736
I'm not gonna waste 1816 on you

18:48.779 --> 18:51.217
if you're gonna drink
the shit out of the mats.

18:51.260 --> 18:56.265
-Line 'em up.
-Okay.

18:56.309 --> 18:59.050
-Whoo!
-You're not gonna do this.

18:59.094 --> 19:00.574
Come on.

19:00.617 --> 19:02.967
-All right.
-That's a big boy.

19:03.011 --> 19:04.099
Yeah, that's real big.

19:04.143 --> 19:06.188
You're a grownup, Wade.
You're a father.

19:06.232 --> 19:10.845
And that's why I get to do this.
Okay.

19:10.888 --> 19:11.976
Cheers.

19:13.848 --> 19:16.416
Here's to being
a proud American citizen.

19:25.251 --> 19:27.253
It's not as bad
as the name suggests.

19:27.296 --> 19:30.647
That's ridiculous.
Get him a real shot, please.

19:30.691 --> 19:33.520
-Please.
-What's it taste like?

19:33.563 --> 19:36.044
It tastes like going blind.

21:58.317 --> 22:01.929

27:08.452 --> 27:12.021
I think you got it, buddy.

27:12.065 --> 27:15.938
You know, um,
cats can do this shit.

27:17.940 --> 27:19.115
Definitely. I mean,

27:19.159 --> 27:20.639
Jess was watching a show
on TV the other day

27:20.682 --> 27:22.641
that said cats are
like evil fuckers.

27:22.684 --> 27:25.339
Like if a cat owner dies
and no one finds 'em,

27:25.382 --> 27:27.080
like all
the soft parts are gone.

27:27.123 --> 27:30.474
It'll come and eat his nose
and his eyelids

27:30.518 --> 27:32.215
and is fucking ears.
All the worst shit,

27:32.259 --> 27:34.565
so it looks like a screaming
skull at the end of it.

27:34.609 --> 27:37.220
They don't give a fuck.
And they're the same

27:37.264 --> 27:39.048
no matter what size,

27:39.092 --> 27:41.877
from a kitten up
to like a Siberian tiger.

27:41.921 --> 27:45.098
They all act exactly the same,
like they play

27:45.141 --> 27:47.491
and they have fun
and they scamper

27:47.535 --> 27:49.580
and they purr and shit.

27:49.624 --> 27:51.626
So like...

27:53.802 --> 27:57.501
A panther could
have done all this.

27:57.545 --> 28:00.853
They're on the rebound too.
They're fucking again.

28:00.896 --> 28:03.594
You ever seen a panther, Wade?

28:04.770 --> 28:06.206
You know anybody that has?

28:08.643 --> 28:10.689
No.

28:10.732 --> 28:13.300
I mean, let me think.

28:16.433 --> 28:18.174
No.

28:18.218 --> 28:21.787
Did I tell you
Abby's cat went missing?

28:21.830 --> 28:24.050
That's it. That's where your
monster is right there.

28:24.093 --> 28:26.356
Like a barrel of toxic waste
like fell off

28:26.400 --> 28:30.491
of a government truck
and Abby's cat like jumped in it

28:30.534 --> 28:34.538
and now it's big and it
just wants to come home.

28:34.582 --> 28:37.367
It ain't a cat, Wade.

28:38.325 --> 28:40.719
How do you know, though?

28:42.285 --> 28:43.939
I saw it.

28:45.898 --> 28:48.509
Did you bring your rifle
with you, bubba?

28:51.381 --> 28:55.342
Now, you said
you saw its hand.

28:55.385 --> 28:59.781
Did you mean its hand
or did you mean paw?

28:59.825 --> 29:02.001
It looked
like a hand, Wade.

29:04.655 --> 29:07.789
I don't know, man.

29:07.833 --> 29:10.836
I was watching a video
the other day on aliens,

29:10.879 --> 29:13.621
and if they land here
scientists say they

29:13.664 --> 29:17.843
probably gonna be predators
because they need meat to grow

29:17.886 --> 29:20.149
the brains the size
they need to be

29:20.193 --> 29:22.238
to get the technology
they need to fucking get here.

29:23.979 --> 29:25.241
And then they showed a
bunch of pictures

29:25.285 --> 29:26.808
of what aliens
could look like,

29:26.852 --> 29:28.984
and they don't look
like us, man.

29:29.028 --> 29:31.291
It's like
Dark Crystalshit.

29:31.334 --> 29:35.730
It's... like because they come
from different gravities

29:35.774 --> 29:37.601
and they have different
like chemical makeups.

29:37.645 --> 29:42.345
They're like... it could be
a squid with like six eyes

29:42.389 --> 29:44.304
or it could have like no eyes
and see with emotions

29:44.347 --> 29:49.439
and it was
a fucking nightmare, Hank.

29:49.483 --> 29:51.441
It was a nightmare.

29:51.485 --> 29:54.357
And it wasn't a horror movie,
it was the Discovery Channel.

29:54.401 --> 29:57.099
And it was during
the fucking day.

29:57.143 --> 30:00.233
You watch a lot of TV, bubba.

30:01.974 --> 30:05.325
I'm just saying that
if I see something like that

30:05.368 --> 30:07.631
come out of one of these bushes,

30:07.675 --> 30:11.679
I'm going to have a fucking
mental breakdown, Hank.

30:11.722 --> 30:14.595
I wouldn't worry
about it, Wade.

30:14.638 --> 30:16.640
You talk enough
to clean the woods.

30:16.684 --> 30:18.512
You're right. You're right.

30:41.404 --> 30:43.450
Abby left.

30:44.451 --> 30:47.149
What do you mean?

30:47.193 --> 30:50.283
I mean she just left.

30:50.326 --> 30:53.460
Note on the fridge.

30:53.503 --> 30:56.115
Where'd she fucking go?

30:57.551 --> 31:01.250
I don't know.
Miami maybe.

31:01.294 --> 31:04.688
That's where she went to school.
Maybe to see her old boyfriend.

31:05.428 --> 31:08.605
Shit, man.

31:08.649 --> 31:11.043
Sitting here. I knew
something else was going on,

31:11.086 --> 31:15.438
but I didn't say anything,
I'm sorry.

31:15.482 --> 31:18.137
I'm just talking about aliens
and squid creatures and shit.

31:18.180 --> 31:19.181
I'm an asshole.

31:19.225 --> 31:21.836
No. No.

31:33.152 --> 31:35.545
Thanks, bubba.

31:44.641 --> 31:48.167
-Wanna go get drunk?
-Yeah, let's go and get drunk.

You still think
it's a bear, Shane?

33:45.936 --> 33:48.548
-That's a fucking bear trap.
-That's a bear trap.

33:48.591 --> 33:50.289
Careful with the lawn now.
I just...

33:50.332 --> 33:52.465
I had it caught, Shane,

33:52.508 --> 33:54.989
and it didn't chew

33:55.033 --> 33:59.080

-What?
-That's bacon.

34:06.522 --> 34:09.047
I'm not crazy.

34:09.090 --> 34:11.092
And I've seen enough
of this thing to know

34:11.136 --> 34:12.572
I don't know what
the hell it is.

34:12.615 --> 34:14.356
And unless it just fell
out of the goddamn sky

34:14.400 --> 34:16.141
and landed in my backyard
in the last few weeks,

34:16.184 --> 34:18.447
I can't be the only person
that's ever seen it, right?

34:18.491 --> 34:20.754
I mean, there's
gotta be reports.

34:20.797 --> 34:25.367
Reports of what, Hank?
Monsters?

34:25.411 --> 34:28.109
My uncle Pete swore

34:28.153 --> 34:30.981
he saw the Lake George monster
when he was a kid.

34:31.025 --> 34:34.507
Told that damn story every
Christmas till the day he died.

34:34.550 --> 34:36.074
Now Hank, do you know
the problem

34:36.117 --> 34:37.292
with my Uncle Pete's story?

34:39.120 --> 34:40.339
The problem with Uncle
Pete's story is

34:40.382 --> 34:45.126
there ain't no goddamn
monster in Lake George.

34:45.170 --> 34:48.216
Just humor me. Please.

34:48.260 --> 34:50.958
-Do a little digging.
-What am I digging for?

34:51.001 --> 34:54.092
I don't know.

34:54.135 --> 34:56.877
Police reports, you know?
Similar descriptions.

34:56.920 --> 34:59.706
-I mean, you're the detective.
-I am not a detective.

34:59.749 --> 35:03.710
I'm a police officer.

35:03.753 --> 35:08.062
Look, Hank, there
ain't one goddamn town

35:08.106 --> 35:11.413
in this whole goddamn world
that don't have someone saying

35:11.457 --> 35:14.938
they've seen something
they can't explain. Right?

35:14.982 --> 35:17.158
Every lake has a lake monster,

35:17.202 --> 35:18.725
every forest has
a big hairy ape.

35:18.768 --> 35:23.164
Hell, I could ask 100 people
in this town alone,

35:23.208 --> 35:26.733
half of them gonna say
they've see a UFO or a ghost.

35:26.776 --> 35:29.214
Shit, most of them
are gonna say they seen both.

35:29.257 --> 35:32.652
Even though 500 years
of hard science hasn't turned up

35:32.695 --> 35:35.655
one single scrap of evidence
for either one.

35:35.698 --> 35:37.831
Not one single scrap.

35:37.874 --> 35:39.789
But that's what we do,
you know?

35:39.833 --> 35:42.009
We fill in the blanks
what we don't understand.

35:42.052 --> 35:43.837
It's human nature.

35:43.880 --> 35:47.275
We've been letting
our imaginations draw faces

35:47.319 --> 35:51.018
on the noises in the dark
since we were living in caves.

35:52.411 --> 35:57.590
And we always
draw sharp teeth.

36:03.073 --> 36:05.380
Eat your fucking food.

36:14.128 --> 36:15.869
Hi, this is Abby.

36:15.912 --> 36:23.746
I'm not around right now,
so leave a message.

36:54.777 --> 36:59.042
What is this?
It's the peanut wine.

36:59.086 --> 37:04.134
-Oh, the famous peanut wine.
-Is it made out of peanuts?

37:04.178 --> 37:08.835
No, it's a vineyard in Georgia
that's also like a peanut farm.

37:08.878 --> 37:11.577
Do you know the five
"S's" of wine tasting?

37:11.620 --> 37:15.755
-I know sniff is your favorite.
-Sniff is my favorite!

37:15.798 --> 37:17.844
Oh, God,
this has aged so poorly.

37:17.887 --> 37:20.107
You can do four of those
"S's," but not all of them.

37:20.150 --> 37:22.283
-Which one can't you do?
-Huh?

37:22.327 --> 37:25.895
Seriously, Wade, I cannot
believe you just said that.

37:25.939 --> 37:30.204
-Wait, what?
-Are you pregnant?

37:30.248 --> 37:32.162
-Yes, we're pregnant.
-Oh, no!

37:32.206 --> 37:34.991
-Congratulations!
-I mean congratulations!

37:35.035 --> 37:38.081
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations. Cheers!

37:38.125 --> 37:41.259
I can't help it.
I'm so potent.

37:41.302 --> 37:42.434
Congratulations.

37:42.477 --> 37:45.393
I just didn't
want to spoil your day.

37:45.437 --> 37:48.614
Oh, no!
This is the best gift.

37:48.657 --> 37:51.399
I'm so excited. Congratulations!

37:51.443 --> 37:54.968
Thank you, it's amazing.

37:55.011 --> 37:59.277
My question is, when are the two
of you gonna have some kids?

37:59.320 --> 38:02.454
Maybe when they
come out at eight years old

38:02.497 --> 38:04.760
so I don't have to do
all the diaper shit.

38:04.804 --> 38:08.851
-Start out at a good age.

38:58.727 --> 39:01.034
You doing all right, Hank?

39:05.821 --> 39:07.780
Yeah, I'm good.

39:20.140 --> 39:23.709
-Oh! That's my ride.

39:23.752 --> 39:28.496
So I'm going to go start
blowing all of this,

39:28.540 --> 39:32.718
and I'll see you later.

39:32.761 --> 39:36.548
-Okay. Night, Jane.
-Good night.

42:18.057 --> 42:19.754
Oh, Jesus.

42:24.672 --> 42:28.720
-Oh, God. Oh, my God.

42:35.814 --> 42:38.425
-Darby?

42:38.468 --> 42:40.601
Darby, is that you, girl?

42:40.645 --> 42:43.082
-Oh, Jesus. Darby. Come here.

42:43.125 --> 42:44.257
-Hey.

42:44.300 --> 42:47.042
-Oh, my God!

42:47.086 --> 42:50.872
Oh! Oh, my God!

42:50.916 --> 42:54.441
What the fuck was that?
What the fuck was that?!

Hank?

49:24.004 --> 49:26.528
You wanna put that in or not?

49:35.363 --> 49:37.800
It's my birthday tomorrow.

49:40.803 --> 49:43.284
I know that.

49:43.328 --> 49:45.765
Abby, of course I know that.

49:47.158 --> 49:50.117
We need to get
the house in order.

49:50.161 --> 49:52.902
-Everybody's coming over.
-No.

49:52.946 --> 49:54.687
Abby, we can't have
people over right now.

49:54.730 --> 49:56.036
Why not?

49:57.907 --> 50:00.084
Because I told you that thing
comes every night.

50:00.127 --> 50:02.912
-Come on, Hank.
-Abby, what? What?

50:02.956 --> 50:05.176
The monster?

50:05.219 --> 50:10.181
Yes, fine. You want me
to put a name on it?

50:10.224 --> 50:11.791
-Yeah, it's a monster.
-Okay.

50:11.834 --> 50:14.098
She didn't get hit
by a car, Abby.

50:16.839 --> 50:20.713
I saw that thing pick her up
and take a bite out of her

50:20.756 --> 50:22.889
like she was a goddamn apple.

50:22.932 --> 50:24.978
Then kill it, Hank.

50:25.022 --> 50:27.372
You're a hunter, right?

50:29.113 --> 50:31.898
That's what you do,
you kill things.

50:33.247 --> 50:36.859
You say it's coming tonight?

50:36.903 --> 50:42.517
Great. When it gets here,
then just fucking kill it.

50:46.173 --> 50:48.262
Can you please fix
the front door?

50:48.306 --> 50:50.873
I don't want to have
to explain that to everybody.

51:36.615 --> 51:39.183
You put the buck
back on the wall.

51:41.010 --> 51:43.839
Yeah.
He has a name, by the way.

51:43.883 --> 51:46.277
It's Valentine.

51:46.320 --> 51:48.540
It's supposed
to be good luck.

51:50.019 --> 51:53.675
-Who told you that?
-Fucking Wade.

51:53.719 --> 51:57.375
He said the Indians said it.

51:57.418 --> 52:00.247
Or the Vikings or some shit.

52:04.512 --> 52:07.080
What time is this thing
showing up?

52:09.169 --> 52:11.606
Any minute now.

52:13.042 --> 52:15.393
If it shows up at all.

52:17.177 --> 52:19.614
I thought you said
it comes every night.

52:19.658 --> 52:24.010
It does. It has.

52:24.053 --> 52:26.969
Every night since you left.

52:27.013 --> 52:29.624
But now you're back.

52:29.668 --> 52:35.152
So I don't know
what's gonna happen.

52:35.195 --> 52:38.546
Hell, I'm not entirely
convinced it's not you.

52:39.721 --> 52:41.723
What's that supposed to mean?

52:41.767 --> 52:45.031
I don't know.

52:45.074 --> 52:50.123
You some kind
of shapeshifter, Abby?

52:50.167 --> 52:53.126
Like a werewolf or something?

52:56.738 --> 52:59.306
You got me.

52:59.350 --> 53:02.570
No, I'm seri...
I'm serious.

53:02.614 --> 53:07.314
What did you open?

53:08.707 --> 53:10.578
It's wine.

53:12.276 --> 53:15.235
I don't know, you tell me.
Do your, um...

53:15.279 --> 53:19.065
Do your little swirly
sniff test thing.

53:19.108 --> 53:21.459
See if you can get it.

53:23.330 --> 53:26.203
Not really feeling
like it tonight.

53:38.780 --> 53:40.695
Okay.

53:47.789 --> 53:50.749
Where'd you go, Abby?

53:53.186 --> 53:55.406
Miami.

53:57.843 --> 53:59.497
Yeah.

53:59.540 --> 54:01.977
Figured.

54:03.762 --> 54:08.941
You go down there and see
your old boyfriend? Huh?

54:08.984 --> 54:10.899
The old fast-talking
city boy who got you

54:10.943 --> 54:14.773
into all this fancy wine shit
in the first place?

54:14.816 --> 54:17.863
That right?

54:17.906 --> 54:19.473
Yeah, of course that's
what you'd think.

54:19.517 --> 54:21.823
What am I supposed to think?

54:22.868 --> 54:24.652
I don't know, Hank.

54:24.696 --> 54:29.266
That I went to my reunion,
like I told you.

54:30.397 --> 54:32.007
That I begged you
to come to.

54:32.051 --> 54:34.401
But you said you didn't
want to drive all that way

54:34.445 --> 54:38.797
just to put on a tie
and stare up people's noses.

54:38.840 --> 54:41.060
Well, it's 'cause
they're snobs.

54:41.103 --> 54:43.149
Yeah, I got it.

54:46.021 --> 54:52.201
So you
didn't see him then?

54:52.245 --> 54:54.203
Is that what you're saying?

54:55.944 --> 54:58.295
No, I did see him.

55:03.778 --> 55:06.694
He was at the reunion
with his wife.

55:06.738 --> 55:10.437
And they left early
to go get their kids.

55:13.310 --> 55:15.660
That's not really
the point, Hank.

55:17.879 --> 55:22.057
Okay. Okay.

55:23.581 --> 55:28.107
Well, that explains
about nine hours.

55:28.150 --> 55:32.241
What about the other four weeks
you were gone? Hm?

55:35.419 --> 55:40.032
-Stop that.

55:45.385 --> 55:47.126
Did you know I'm the only
member of my family

55:47.169 --> 55:51.522
that's been on a plane?

55:51.565 --> 55:53.393
Okay.

55:54.829 --> 55:56.875
All right, Abby.
What is the point?

55:56.918 --> 56:00.531
Barlow is enough for them.
That's the point.

56:01.662 --> 56:04.056
But it's not enough for me.

56:06.928 --> 56:10.454
I need art and culture.

56:10.497 --> 56:12.978
And food that isn't brown

56:13.021 --> 56:17.939
and music that
isn't all banjos.

56:22.683 --> 56:25.817
You know, while I was gone,

56:25.860 --> 56:27.862
I had sushi...

56:29.516 --> 56:31.953
...and curry and Cuban food

56:31.997 --> 56:37.350
and... tamales

56:37.394 --> 56:39.134
from a guy on a bike.

56:39.178 --> 56:44.879
And I saw a jazz band
play on the street

56:44.923 --> 56:47.360
and I drank wines
that I couldn't even pronounce.

56:47.404 --> 56:50.711
And I went to a museum
and I went to a baseball game.

56:50.755 --> 56:52.626
And...

56:53.888 --> 56:57.501
...that was all
in just one city.

56:57.544 --> 57:01.461
That was just Miami,
and just one month.

57:01.505 --> 57:04.377
Four hours
from our front porch.

57:07.902 --> 57:10.775
I spent the last month

57:10.818 --> 57:15.127
trying to run my business
without my partner.

57:17.129 --> 57:20.088
Trying to keep our dirty
laundry from

57:20.132 --> 57:22.700
getting aired all over town.

57:22.743 --> 57:28.009
Thinking I was losing my
fucking mind and my best friend.

57:28.053 --> 57:31.839
Wondering if I was
ever gonna see you again.

57:34.015 --> 57:37.236
But hey, tamales.

57:39.499 --> 57:41.588
I'm glad you had
such a good time.

57:41.632 --> 57:44.722
I am sorry
about all of that.

57:44.765 --> 57:46.854
Good.

57:48.900 --> 57:51.250
-I did want to call.
-Hm.

57:51.293 --> 57:55.210
But I knew if I did that you'd
just convince me to come back,

57:55.254 --> 57:59.040
or I'd...
I'd get so mad at you

57:59.084 --> 58:03.175
that I would never
come home at all, so...

58:03.218 --> 58:07.048
I figured I'd just have
to figure it out for myself.

58:07.092 --> 58:11.400
Well, did you?

58:17.581 --> 58:21.454
You know when I came home
after school that summer?

58:22.716 --> 58:27.286
I was just gonna
save some money,

58:27.329 --> 58:32.726
see my parents,
and that was it.

58:32.770 --> 58:35.163
I never intended
to stay here.

58:35.207 --> 58:37.557
Well, why did you, Abby?

58:37.601 --> 58:40.778
For Christ sake,
why'd you stay?

58:40.821 --> 58:43.171
Because of you, Hank.

58:44.390 --> 58:46.435
Because of you,
you wooed me,

58:46.479 --> 58:50.527
and you swept me off my feet
and I fucking fell for it.

58:52.050 --> 58:55.401
Goddamn it, you used
to look at me like I was...

58:56.794 --> 59:00.493
You used to look at me like...

59:00.537 --> 59:03.278
...you couldn't believe
that I existed.

59:04.845 --> 59:08.283
Like you couldn't
believe your luck. You know?

59:08.327 --> 59:12.244
And now, you hardly
look at me at all.

59:14.072 --> 59:16.204
Look at me, Hank.

59:18.250 --> 59:21.035
I see you,

59:21.079 --> 59:24.212
cutting eyes at other girls
all the time.

59:24.256 --> 59:30.001
-Oh, come on.
-I'm not crazy.

59:30.044 --> 59:31.437
I don't think everything's
gonna be all

59:31.480 --> 59:33.744
spontaneous
and new forever.

59:33.787 --> 59:37.661
But I know you,
and I know you're a hunter.

59:39.924 --> 59:43.623
Maybe it was all about
the pursuit all those years ago,

59:43.667 --> 59:46.974
and now you're just looking
for something else to chase.

59:52.110 --> 59:55.417
And now it's been ten years,

59:55.461 --> 59:58.072
and I wake up and...

59:59.421 --> 1:00:02.903
...I'm a 33-year-old

1:00:02.947 --> 1:00:06.907
unmarried, childless
bar manager

1:00:06.951 --> 1:00:11.042
living in the only place that
I really ever wanted to leave.

1:00:13.871 --> 1:00:18.658
And I think maybe you're
looking around

1:00:18.702 --> 1:00:23.445
to see if there's
something else you can chase.

1:00:23.489 --> 1:00:25.839
And I'm thinking about all
those things that I gave up

1:00:25.883 --> 1:00:28.625
just for a spot
on your wall.

1:00:36.067 --> 1:00:38.591
Everyone I know
is married.

1:00:40.245 --> 1:00:42.551
They all have kids.

1:00:45.467 --> 1:00:48.514
And I have to hear it
all the time, you know.

1:00:50.342 --> 1:00:52.997
"What are you two doing?

1:00:53.040 --> 1:00:55.695
What's he waiting for?"

1:00:57.871 --> 1:00:59.090
I used to think that was
just some

1:00:59.133 --> 1:01:01.179
small town bullshit
I didn't care about.

1:01:01.222 --> 1:01:06.967
You know? Getting married,
having a whole litter of kids.

1:01:10.405 --> 1:01:14.409
I don't know, Hank.
What are we doing?

1:01:14.453 --> 1:01:18.587
-What are you waiting for?

1:01:21.068 --> 1:01:22.896
Because if you're waiting
for me to look like

1:01:24.506 --> 1:01:26.726
Jane again...

1:01:26.770 --> 1:01:28.075
Oh!

1:01:28.119 --> 1:01:30.382
You know 20-something
years old, stars in my eyes,

1:01:30.425 --> 1:01:33.167
or if you're just looking for
some other dumb doe to chase,

1:01:33.211 --> 1:01:34.734
I really wish you
would tell me.

1:01:34.778 --> 1:01:37.911
Because it would make things
a whole lot easier.

1:01:41.436 --> 1:01:44.265
You have everything
you want here.

1:01:46.093 --> 1:01:49.749
You have me,
you have the bar,

1:01:49.793 --> 1:01:53.318
you have Wade,
you have your hunting buddies.

1:01:55.189 --> 1:01:58.802
You have all these woods
and this big fucking house,

1:01:58.845 --> 1:02:01.543
this falling-apart house.

1:02:06.157 --> 1:02:09.682
But what if I had gone
back to the city, you know,

1:02:09.726 --> 1:02:13.294
all those years ago,
and you had come with me?

1:02:14.556 --> 1:02:17.342
And we'd been
living in, like,

1:02:17.385 --> 1:02:21.781
a one-bedroom walk-up
all these years, you know?

1:02:27.308 --> 1:02:29.746
You could hear
our neighbors above us,

1:02:29.789 --> 1:02:32.444
the traffic outside.

1:02:35.534 --> 1:02:37.318
You didn't any
of that stuff

1:02:37.362 --> 1:02:40.887
and you couldn't wander into
the woods any time you wanted.

1:02:44.804 --> 1:02:47.720
You didn't have any of the
things that made you you, or

1:02:49.853 --> 1:02:51.942
gave you purpose.

1:02:57.817 --> 1:02:59.776
Would I be enough for you?

1:03:02.474 --> 1:03:04.302
I don't think I would.

1:03:06.391 --> 1:03:08.828
Baby.

1:03:08.872 --> 1:03:11.700
Hey, look.

1:03:18.490 --> 1:03:20.361
Look at that.

1:03:22.799 --> 1:03:28.456
Now I'm a 34-year-old...

1:03:28.500 --> 1:03:32.373
...unmarried, childless

1:03:32.417 --> 1:03:35.768
bar manager that
lives in the sticks.

1:03:41.382 --> 1:03:43.515
Thirty-four.

1:03:47.736 --> 1:03:51.392
You remember where we were
tonight ten years ago?

1:03:55.832 --> 1:03:58.095
Yeah.

1:03:58.138 --> 1:04:01.228
Uh-huh. Right here.

1:04:02.839 --> 1:04:05.058
Right in this room.

1:04:10.150 --> 1:04:11.369
Sometimes it feels like

1:04:11.412 --> 1:04:13.284
we've lived our
whole lives in this room.

1:04:22.423 --> 1:04:24.730
I don't think
your monster is coming.

1:04:51.626 --> 1:04:54.934
-"For Julie?"
-Wait, what is it?

1:04:54.978 --> 1:04:56.066
Who the fuck is Julie?

1:04:56.109 --> 1:04:58.068
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Let me see that.

1:04:58.111 --> 1:05:03.029
No way! Listen,
this... this is incredible.

1:05:03.073 --> 1:05:05.684
I mean, this is a very
romantic birthday.

1:05:05.727 --> 1:05:08.861
Oh, yeah, talk about putting
lipstick on a fucking pig.

1:05:08.905 --> 1:05:14.171
But this tape, which is probably
full of horribly embarrassing,

1:05:14.214 --> 1:05:17.391
very dated,
super emotional songs

1:05:17.435 --> 1:05:19.132
that you put on a tape
for another girl.

1:05:19.176 --> 1:05:20.655
Oh, no, just one song.

1:05:20.699 --> 1:05:22.222
I'm sorry,
there's one song on here?

1:05:22.266 --> 1:05:23.441
Yeah, you know, you
put one song and

1:05:23.484 --> 1:05:24.529
you repeat it
over and over again.

1:05:24.572 --> 1:05:26.096
No, I don't know this.

1:05:26.139 --> 1:05:28.098
-So you don't have to rewind.
-You do it over and over?

1:05:28.141 --> 1:05:30.927
-Oh, my God.
-Okay, so this tape

1:05:30.970 --> 1:05:34.452
is full of one song,
over and over,

1:05:34.495 --> 1:05:37.063
for another girl that is not me

1:05:37.107 --> 1:05:40.458
but it somehow made its way
here on my birthday.

1:05:40.501 --> 1:05:44.679
This gift,
you can't put a bow on it.

1:05:44.723 --> 1:05:48.988
-Oh, don't pull that shit.
-You can't unwrap this tape.

1:05:49.032 --> 1:05:51.034
I just said that to you,
come on.

1:05:51.077 --> 1:05:55.734
This is truly experiential.

1:05:55.777 --> 1:05:59.390
-Just play the fucking tape.
-I'm gonna play the tape.

Okay, you guys have

1:07:07.197 --> 1:07:09.590
This is my first attempt.

1:07:09.634 --> 1:07:12.376
-Oh, I know what that is.
-Jesus Christ, what is that?

1:07:12.419 --> 1:07:15.422
-Take one and pass it down.
-Is that pond water?

1:07:15.466 --> 1:07:20.949
I call it Sauvignon
Brun, because it's... brown.

1:07:20.993 --> 1:07:24.953

Sauvignon Bluhh!

So you like stomped on grapes
with your dirty feet.

1:07:33.397 --> 1:07:37.314
-Is that why it's brown?
-Uh, no. It just...

1:07:37.357 --> 1:07:39.794
I didn't seal it right
so it oxidized,

1:07:39.838 --> 1:07:42.188
you know how like
an apple goes brown?

1:07:42.232 --> 1:07:44.321
- That means it's rotten.
-Shut up, baby.

1:07:44.364 --> 1:07:46.975
I'm not trying to be negative.
I'm just curious.

1:07:47.019 --> 1:07:51.197
Does anyone know
the proper way to taste wine?

1:07:52.242 --> 1:07:56.333
See. Swirl.

1:07:56.376 --> 1:07:58.074
Sniff.

1:07:59.684 --> 1:08:03.209
-Sip and savor.
-That's right.

1:08:05.429 --> 1:08:07.648
-You guys remember Jonestown?

1:08:07.692 --> 1:08:11.217
-I think about it all the time.
-Did we just do a pact?

1:08:11.261 --> 1:08:13.959
Oh, man, we didn't even
do any community outreach.

1:08:14.002 --> 1:08:17.354
-This is so much fun, guys.

1:08:17.397 --> 1:08:20.052
I don't even remember the last
time I actually got drunk.

1:08:21.836 --> 1:08:25.188
I do. I think it was like
two glasses of wine ago.

1:08:25.231 --> 1:08:27.799
Ha-ha.

1:08:27.842 --> 1:08:29.627
No, well, mama got the nuggets

1:08:29.670 --> 1:08:31.759
and she told us to live it up
a little bit.

1:08:31.803 --> 1:08:35.502
You-- you-you. We're staying
up to the crack of 12:30.

1:08:35.546 --> 1:08:37.461
-Whoa!

1:08:37.504 --> 1:08:40.028
-Party animals.
-Yeah.

1:08:40.072 --> 1:08:41.334
Speak for yourself.

1:08:41.378 --> 1:08:42.901
I may have three
glasses of wine tonight.

1:08:42.944 --> 1:08:45.904
-Whoa!
-So, uh, Hank.

1:08:45.947 --> 1:08:49.647
Is your monster
stopping by tonight?

1:08:49.690 --> 1:08:51.910
Shane.

1:08:51.953 --> 1:08:54.521
-Come on, man.
-What? Everybody knows.

1:08:56.044 --> 1:08:57.524
Oh, come on.

1:08:57.568 --> 1:08:58.917
There's a goddamn
elephant in the room

1:08:58.960 --> 1:09:01.093
and no one
wants to talk about it.

1:09:01.137 --> 1:09:04.227
It wasn't an elephant.

1:09:04.270 --> 1:09:08.361
-It was a panther.

1:09:08.405 --> 1:09:11.973
All right,
I do have one question.

1:09:12.017 --> 1:09:18.763
Uh... has anyone here
seen a UFO?

1:09:18.806 --> 1:09:21.287
-Yes.
-I did once.

1:09:22.593 --> 1:09:25.726
See? Now, Pam.

1:09:25.770 --> 1:09:28.599
You are sure it
was an alien spacecraft?

1:09:28.642 --> 1:09:32.342
It couldn't have been a plane,
a helicopter, a weather balloon?

1:09:32.385 --> 1:09:34.648
It wasn't a weather balloon.
No.

1:09:34.692 --> 1:09:38.652
Do you have any idea how vast
the universe is?

1:09:38.696 --> 1:09:43.483
I do, it's like...
like nine football fields wide.

1:09:43.527 --> 1:09:47.531
And if you are smart enough to
travel billions of light years,

1:09:47.574 --> 1:09:49.794
why the fuck would you
come to Barlow?

1:09:49.837 --> 1:09:51.883
-I mean, that's a good point.
-You're not wrong.

1:09:51.926 --> 1:09:54.190
-You're not wrong on that one.
-I am not wrong.

1:09:54.233 --> 1:09:57.497
-Because I am a police officer.
-You're a police officer?

1:09:57.541 --> 1:10:00.848
Did you guys know...
did you know that?

1:10:00.892 --> 1:10:01.806
I had heard, yeah.

1:10:01.849 --> 1:10:05.070
And as
a police officer,

1:10:05.113 --> 1:10:08.291
it is my job to use logic
and evidence

1:10:08.334 --> 1:10:11.598
and the powers of deduction
to figure things out.

1:10:11.642 --> 1:10:12.904
And that is why, Pam,

1:10:12.947 --> 1:10:17.082
a zig-zagging light
in the sky ain't a UFO,

1:10:17.125 --> 1:10:20.912
a glob of dust on a photo
ain't a ghost,

1:10:20.955 --> 1:10:23.697
and Hank, whatever the hell
has been coming around

1:10:23.741 --> 1:10:26.352
your house for the last month,

1:10:26.396 --> 1:10:29.050
it ain't a goblin
or a goddamn demon

1:10:29.094 --> 1:10:31.749
or anything else magical
or supernatural, all right?

1:10:31.792 --> 1:10:33.272
It's just not.

1:10:33.316 --> 1:10:35.231
Shane, this is not
the time or the place.

1:10:35.274 --> 1:10:37.798
I'm sorry, for the last month

1:10:37.842 --> 1:10:40.410
Hank has been shooting at cars

1:10:40.453 --> 1:10:42.586
and ranting and raving
about monsters,

1:10:42.629 --> 1:10:44.849
and now we're all gonna sit here
and pretend it didn't happen?

1:10:44.892 --> 1:10:47.417
I mean, we're all friends,
some of us are family.

1:10:47.460 --> 1:10:48.287
Shane, stop!

1:10:48.331 --> 1:10:49.810
Some of us should be family

1:10:49.854 --> 1:10:52.160
and I'm saying all of this
because I love you.

1:10:52.204 --> 1:10:53.249
Is that what it is?

1:10:53.292 --> 1:10:55.686
You're doing it
because you love me?

1:10:55.729 --> 1:10:58.645
I love you too, buddy.

1:10:58.689 --> 1:11:01.169
I love you too, Shane.

1:11:05.304 --> 1:11:06.523
You're right.

1:11:08.873 --> 1:11:11.354
I've been an asshole lately.

1:11:11.397 --> 1:11:14.313
Well, longer than lately,
I guess.

1:11:14.357 --> 1:11:19.318
But lately I've been more of an
asshole and I'm sorry for that.

1:11:19.362 --> 1:11:23.104
And you're right, maybe
we should've been family by now.

1:11:25.890 --> 1:11:29.720
But you're wrong
about what I saw.

1:11:31.983 --> 1:11:36.466
Oh, my God,
the fucking ego on you.

1:11:36.509 --> 1:11:40.774
You're a bachelor sheriff
in a backwoods shithole

1:11:40.818 --> 1:11:43.951
and you think you
got it all figured out.

1:11:43.995 --> 1:11:46.127
Right, baby?

1:11:48.956 --> 1:11:51.394
You're right, baby.

1:11:53.961 --> 1:11:57.356
Hell, you're right about
most things most of the time.

1:11:57.400 --> 1:11:59.489
You're right about this town.

1:11:59.532 --> 1:12:02.448
This town is nothing but a speck
of dust in a great big world

1:12:02.492 --> 1:12:05.538
that's nothing but a speck
of dust in a galaxy,

1:12:05.582 --> 1:12:08.715
that's nothing but a speck
of dust in a big wide universe.

1:12:10.978 --> 1:12:12.458
And if no thinking thing
in its right mind

1:12:12.502 --> 1:12:16.897
is gonna go all that way
to come to Barlow...

1:12:20.597 --> 1:12:24.557
...well, how could I ever
expect you to stay here?

1:12:28.126 --> 1:12:30.346
You're right, I...

1:12:30.389 --> 1:12:35.568
I never gave enough thought to
the things that made you happy.

1:12:37.048 --> 1:12:38.571
To the things you care about,

1:12:38.615 --> 1:12:41.357
or... the things that
make you who you are.

1:12:44.142 --> 1:12:47.841
Or hell, maybe I
ignored them sometimes

1:12:47.885 --> 1:12:49.626
because, I don't know,

1:12:49.669 --> 1:12:54.065
they made me
feel small or stupid.

1:12:54.108 --> 1:12:56.154
Just selfish shit, you know?

1:13:00.811 --> 1:13:02.900
I always knew with you
I caught something

1:13:02.943 --> 1:13:07.121
that you can't lock up.

1:13:07.165 --> 1:13:08.819
And then I went
and tried to do it anyway.

1:13:10.647 --> 1:13:13.954
I'm sorry.

1:13:13.998 --> 1:13:16.522
So let's get
the fuck out of here.

1:13:16.566 --> 1:13:19.264
Let's get out of this place.
Sell the bar,

1:13:19.307 --> 1:13:23.181
let's get rid of this
big stupid goddamn house

1:13:23.224 --> 1:13:25.444
that's been in my family,
it's been killing everybody,

1:13:25.488 --> 1:13:27.098
I'm never gonna fix it.

1:13:27.141 --> 1:13:29.709
You're right about that too.
And let's move.

1:13:29.753 --> 1:13:32.233
You want to move to Miami?
Let's go.

1:13:32.277 --> 1:13:36.020
Or Madrid, Moscow...

1:13:36.063 --> 1:13:38.109
I'll go anywhere with you.

1:13:39.980 --> 1:13:43.201
Anywhere.

1:13:43.244 --> 1:13:44.637
Because, yeah, you're
right about most things,

1:13:44.681 --> 1:13:47.423
but you're wrong
about one thing.

1:13:48.946 --> 1:13:51.470
You are enough for me, Abby.

1:13:59.957 --> 1:14:02.699
One... one more thing.

1:14:17.540 --> 1:14:20.456
