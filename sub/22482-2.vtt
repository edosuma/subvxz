WEBVTT

00:01.402 --> 00:04.105
Previously on Mom...
My mom wanted to say hi.

00:04.138 --> 00:07.141
Hey, it's nice to meet you.
Get over here, you!

00:07.175 --> 00:09.277
Thank you so much for
taking care of my girl.

00:09.310 --> 00:10.644
I'm Christy, Jill's friend.

00:10.678 --> 00:13.614
Did you ever dance
at Live Nudes?

00:13.647 --> 00:15.383
I used to work there, too.

00:15.416 --> 00:16.384
As long as you're in here,

00:16.417 --> 00:17.785
why not give it
a real try?

00:17.818 --> 00:19.187
I have tried.

00:19.220 --> 00:20.254
How about this time I help you?

00:20.288 --> 00:21.255
You would do that?

00:21.289 --> 00:23.124
We're pole pals.

00:23.157 --> 00:25.093
Hey, great news, baby.
Christy's gonna help me

00:25.126 --> 00:27.628
get out of here so you and me
can move to L.A.

00:27.661 --> 00:30.464
Help Natasha, and when
they take Emily away from me,

00:30.498 --> 00:32.066
and that woman
puts her through hell,

00:32.100 --> 00:33.801
and she gets stuck
in another foster home,

00:33.834 --> 00:35.703
you can feel real proud
of yourself.

00:35.736 --> 00:38.239
You were in rehab over and over,

00:38.272 --> 00:39.373
and we never gave up on you

00:39.407 --> 00:40.741
'cause we don't
throw people away.

00:42.210 --> 00:44.845
Who are you?
Who are you?

00:44.878 --> 00:47.848
This is my mother
with my father.

00:47.881 --> 00:50.551
Wow, there's Grandma

00:50.584 --> 00:52.052
(whispering):
with a black man.

00:53.354 --> 00:54.755
I'm sorry, that was weird.

00:54.788 --> 00:58.659
I don't know why I whispered.
We have black friends.

00:58.692 --> 01:01.395
Here's the e-mail
we got from a lawyer.

01:01.429 --> 01:03.531
Are you saying
you're my sister?

01:03.564 --> 01:05.633
I'm not sayin' nothin'
to nobody.

01:05.666 --> 01:09.303
Boy, this is hard to say...

01:09.337 --> 01:12.573
but I guess you're probably
the best people to say it to.

01:12.606 --> 01:14.342
I've gotten
to a point where

01:14.375 --> 01:17.478
I'm snorting coke every day.

01:18.646 --> 01:21.249
Welcome to the family!
We're here!

01:24.285 --> 01:25.686
What are you so happy about?

01:25.719 --> 01:27.355
Just look at Natasha.

01:27.388 --> 01:30.324
I know I'm sitting here on
my ass, but in a small way,

01:30.358 --> 01:32.893
I'm over there cleaning
that table with her.

01:32.926 --> 01:35.163
(drops dishes)

01:35.196 --> 01:38.299
Well, neither one of you
is doing a very good job.

01:38.332 --> 01:41.135
You go right ahead and be
proud of yourself, Christy.

01:41.169 --> 01:43.371
You've been a big help
to that girl.

01:43.404 --> 01:44.772
Thank you, Marjorie.

01:44.805 --> 01:46.740
Did you hear that, Mom?

01:46.774 --> 01:48.742
(dishes clattering)

01:48.776 --> 01:50.644
Did you hear that, Christy?

01:50.678 --> 01:52.846
I like your top, Wendy.

01:52.880 --> 01:54.815
Thank you.
Jill gave me

01:54.848 --> 01:56.884
a bunch of her clothes
she can't fit int...

01:56.917 --> 01:58.686
Doesn't want.

02:00.554 --> 02:01.855
Doesn't want anymore.

02:01.889 --> 02:04.892
Please, God,
tell me it's almost 4:00.

02:04.925 --> 02:06.260
It's 12:30.

02:06.294 --> 02:09.530
Damn it. Scooch.
(sighs)

02:09.563 --> 02:12.200
You probably shouldn't sit
with us while you're working.

02:12.233 --> 02:13.801
Yeah, and some kid
probably shouldn't have

02:13.834 --> 02:15.936
puked up waffles
on the bathroom floor.

02:15.969 --> 02:17.771
I'm just hoping
nobody slips on it.

02:17.805 --> 02:21.475
You should be very proud.

02:21.509 --> 02:23.311
This job sucks.

02:23.344 --> 02:25.713
I made more stripping, and
I worked the brunch shift.

02:25.746 --> 02:26.880
Yeah, but if you
were stripping,

02:26.914 --> 02:27.948
you probably wouldn't
stay sober.

02:27.981 --> 02:30.651
Was that brunch a buffet or...

02:30.684 --> 02:32.286
We're not eating
at a strip club, Wendy.

02:32.320 --> 02:34.488
Why not? We ate
at the gas station

02:34.522 --> 02:36.357
that you wanted to go to.

02:37.491 --> 02:39.860
Hard work is a part
of recovery.

02:39.893 --> 02:42.196
She's right.
When I was in rehab,

02:42.230 --> 02:44.332
I spent every morning
slicing up cucumbers

02:44.365 --> 02:45.533
for the spa water.

02:45.566 --> 02:48.436
Hasn't seen many
cucumbers lately.

02:48.469 --> 02:52.373
Vomit.
Ladies room, now.

02:52.406 --> 02:53.941
Yay, sobriety!

02:55.576 --> 02:57.278
Oh, like she never
cleaned up vomit

02:57.311 --> 02:58.379
when she was stripping.

02:58.412 --> 02:59.847
(phone chimes)

02:59.880 --> 03:02.616
Yeah, well, she better clean it
quick, 'cause I gotta pee.

03:02.650 --> 03:04.352
Hey, Christy,
Ray's coming to town.

03:04.385 --> 03:05.353
Oh, that's great.

03:05.386 --> 03:06.754
How's your brother doing?

03:06.787 --> 03:08.389
Well, he kicked the blow
three months ago,

03:08.422 --> 03:10.758
so he's probably twitchy
and angry and wants everyone

03:10.791 --> 03:12.993
around him to die a slow
and painful death.

03:13.026 --> 03:16.196
Funny how you never
got past that.

03:17.631 --> 03:20.834
Wow, an unmotivated shot.
I like it.

03:22.035 --> 03:24.438
Oh, he's such a pretty man.

03:24.472 --> 03:25.873
Is he still a homosexual?

03:27.007 --> 03:29.377
Yeah, I don't think,
when you marry a man,

03:29.410 --> 03:30.511
that's a phase.

03:30.544 --> 03:32.846
What a waste.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.014
Well, if I can't have him,

03:34.047 --> 03:35.683
I can sure as hell
have a waffle.

03:35.716 --> 03:36.950
Server.

03:38.419 --> 03:40.354
*

03:54.602 --> 03:55.969
(groans)

03:56.003 --> 03:57.705
No. No beer.

03:57.738 --> 03:59.440
Why? It's after 4:00.

03:59.473 --> 04:01.509
My brother is newly sober.

04:01.542 --> 04:02.876
He doesn't need to be tempted.

04:02.910 --> 04:04.445
I'll finish it
before he gets here.

04:04.478 --> 04:06.013
(knock on door)
CHRISTY:
That's him.

04:11.319 --> 04:13.053
Ray!

04:13.086 --> 04:14.355
Hey, Christy.

04:14.388 --> 04:15.923
Get in here. Ah.

04:17.024 --> 04:19.026
Hey, Bonnie.

04:19.059 --> 04:21.629
Ah. How are you?

04:21.662 --> 04:23.464
Great. Really great.

04:23.497 --> 04:25.466
(belches)

04:25.499 --> 04:27.368
You remember Adam.

04:27.401 --> 04:29.002
Of course.
What's up?

04:29.036 --> 04:30.338
Good to see you.

04:30.371 --> 04:32.873
You look so healthy
and rested.

04:32.906 --> 04:34.007
What can I say?

04:34.041 --> 04:36.444
Sobriety suits me.
Oh.

04:36.477 --> 04:38.346
Oh, man, when I first got sober,

04:38.379 --> 04:41.449
all I did was sleep, cry,
and listen to Jewel.

04:41.482 --> 04:43.384
I only wish I'd done it sooner.

04:43.417 --> 04:45.619
If I'd gotten sober sooner,
she wouldn't be here.

04:45.653 --> 04:47.455
Oh, I'd be here.

04:47.488 --> 04:48.956
I'd just be younger
and taller.

04:50.791 --> 04:52.526
Seems like it's going
really well.

04:52.560 --> 04:55.763
Yeah. I'm going to meetings,
I got a sponsor.

04:55.796 --> 04:58.098
I even joined a sober
basketball team.

04:58.131 --> 04:59.900
We suck, but it's fun.

04:59.933 --> 05:01.369
Really?

05:01.402 --> 05:03.937
That is not what happened to me.

05:03.971 --> 05:05.606
You like basketball?

05:05.639 --> 05:07.808
The black part of me does.
The gay part hates it.

05:08.809 --> 05:10.043
No, no, I didn't mean it...

05:10.077 --> 05:11.445
I'm just messing with you.

05:11.479 --> 05:13.046
I love sports, but I hate

05:13.080 --> 05:14.782
tiny little dogs and Halloween.

05:15.716 --> 05:17.451
What about musicals?

05:17.485 --> 05:19.720
Oh, you gotta like some of
that stuff, they kick you out.

05:20.588 --> 05:22.490
Halloween's a thing?

05:22.523 --> 05:24.458
Where you been?
That's gay Christmas.

05:24.492 --> 05:26.560
Last year, I was
in a bar with 300 guys

05:26.594 --> 05:27.895
dressed as Hamilton.

05:27.928 --> 05:30.598
So, how long you
in town for?

05:30.631 --> 05:31.765
Couple days.

05:31.799 --> 05:33.601
Frog's Creek Winery is a client.

05:33.634 --> 05:34.635
Is David with you?

05:34.668 --> 05:36.069
David's his husband.

05:36.103 --> 05:37.137
Yeah, I pieced that together.

05:37.170 --> 05:39.573
Nah, he's home binging
Love It or List It.

05:39.607 --> 05:41.041
That's a real estate
makeover show.

05:41.074 --> 05:42.876
Got that one, too.

05:42.910 --> 05:44.978
Hey, you should come with us
to our meeting tomorrow.

05:45.012 --> 05:47.915
Ooh, you could speak.
Your story is so inspiring.

05:47.948 --> 05:49.950
Or you could come
to the Warriors game with me.

05:49.983 --> 05:51.452
I got great seats.

05:51.485 --> 05:53.521
Buddy of mine is
Steph Curry's dentist.

05:53.554 --> 05:55.489
Steph Curry is
a famous basketball player.

05:55.523 --> 05:58.091
Yeah, I know who she is.

06:00.027 --> 06:02.563
And you're not staying
in a hotel.

06:02.596 --> 06:04.064
You're staying
with your family.

06:04.097 --> 06:05.032
On our lumpy couch.

06:05.065 --> 06:09.403
Okay, but heads up,
I get up at 6:00 a.m.

06:09.437 --> 06:10.738
to run and do yoga.

06:10.771 --> 06:13.140
He's doing better than you.
I'm getting another beer.

06:17.578 --> 06:19.680
(Adam and Ray laughing)

06:21.615 --> 06:23.183
Why aren't you in bed
with your boyfriend?

06:23.216 --> 06:26.086
'Cause he's busy talking
to hi boyfriend.

06:26.119 --> 06:28.155
It started with basketball,
now they're bonding

06:28.188 --> 06:30.157
over Mark Wahlberg movies.

06:30.190 --> 06:32.460
Sounds like Ray's doing great.

06:32.493 --> 06:33.827
Yeah, I don't get it.

06:33.861 --> 06:35.829
Have you ever met anyone,
anywhere, at any time

06:35.863 --> 06:37.565
that gave up cocaine
that easily?

06:37.598 --> 06:39.733
Lots of...
Without prison?

06:39.767 --> 06:41.835
My friend Jenny...
Switched to meth.

06:41.869 --> 06:43.571
Joe...
Died.

06:43.604 --> 06:45.673
Joe died?

06:45.706 --> 06:47.741
Yeah, Super Bowl Sunday.

06:49.610 --> 06:50.911
Ray's your brother!

06:50.944 --> 06:52.780
Be happy he's doing well.

06:52.813 --> 06:54.948
I am happy.
I just wouldn't mind seeing

06:54.982 --> 06:57.217
some night sweats,
a few days in jail,

06:57.250 --> 06:58.952
maybe a mild seizure.

06:59.853 --> 07:01.088
(Adam and Ray laughing)

07:01.121 --> 07:02.823
All right, I've got to
put a stop to this.

07:02.856 --> 07:04.758
You're really upset
that they're getting along?

07:04.792 --> 07:06.660
Apparently.

07:08.896 --> 07:10.598
My date ready yet?

07:10.631 --> 07:13.200
You are ten years younger than
me and quite good-looking--

07:13.233 --> 07:15.202
please don't refer to him
as your date.

07:15.235 --> 07:20.173
Oh, Bonnie, I'm 15 years
younger than you.

07:21.241 --> 07:23.243
Must have forgotten
your sunscreen

07:23.276 --> 07:24.812
'cause you got burned.

07:26.814 --> 07:30.150
Yeah, that was a lot funnier
in seventh grade.

07:30.183 --> 07:31.619
Let's hit it.

07:31.652 --> 07:33.721
Have fun.
All right. Mwah.

07:33.754 --> 07:35.723
Are you wearing cologne?

07:35.756 --> 07:37.625
I don't know, maybe.

07:37.658 --> 07:39.827
You put on cologne
for my brother?

07:39.860 --> 07:41.228
I put on cologne
for Steph Curry.

07:41.261 --> 07:43.597
You never know, he might
jump in the stands

07:43.631 --> 07:44.832
and land in my lap.

07:45.933 --> 07:47.668
And I'm the gay one.

07:47.701 --> 07:48.969
Can we go, please?

07:49.002 --> 07:51.271
Let me get my keys.
No, I'll drive.

07:51.304 --> 07:52.673
I got a Mercedes.

07:52.706 --> 07:53.874
I got handicap parking.

07:53.907 --> 07:56.009
I love this guy.

07:56.043 --> 07:58.612
Look at 'em, they're like
a '70s cop show.

07:58.646 --> 07:59.780
ADAM:
Come on, Huggy Bear.

07:59.813 --> 08:01.515
Right behind ya, Wheels.

08:03.250 --> 08:04.184
They are so cute.

08:04.217 --> 08:06.887
I still say something's
not right about him.

08:06.920 --> 08:08.689
Are you kidding?
He's thriving.

08:08.722 --> 08:09.890
Nah, I'm not buying it.

08:09.923 --> 08:11.291
You don't go right
from coke fiend to...

08:11.324 --> 08:14.227
(deep voice): "I get up at
6:00 a.m. to do yoga."

08:15.929 --> 08:16.930
Well, I'm glad for him.

08:16.964 --> 08:18.532
Ugh, that is so you.

08:19.667 --> 08:20.801
Come on.

08:20.834 --> 08:21.969
Let's go to our damn meeting.

08:22.002 --> 08:24.638
(sighs)
My car or yours?

08:24.672 --> 08:26.807
Ray's.
I'll hate the world

08:26.840 --> 08:29.109
a little less in a Mercedes.

08:33.581 --> 08:34.682
Mind slowing down?

08:34.715 --> 08:36.216
Hey, I'm going over 50

08:36.249 --> 08:37.685
and the windows
aren't rattling.

08:37.718 --> 08:39.319
Let me have this.

08:39.352 --> 08:40.721
(sighs)

08:40.754 --> 08:42.189
Look at the
temperature control.

08:42.222 --> 08:44.224
We each have
our own zone.

08:44.257 --> 08:44.992
(chuckles)

08:45.025 --> 08:47.695
I can make your zone
really hot.

08:47.728 --> 08:49.730
I'm gonna make mine
really cold.

08:49.763 --> 08:52.232
Let's see if it rains
in the middle of the car.

08:52.265 --> 08:54.134
(chuckling)

08:54.167 --> 08:56.737
Ooh, what do you
think this button

08:56.770 --> 08:57.871
with the squiggly
lines does?

08:57.905 --> 08:59.973
Will you look
at the road?!

09:00.007 --> 09:01.575
I tell you, if I had
a car like this,

09:01.609 --> 09:03.911
sobriety would be
easy for me, too.

09:03.944 --> 09:06.246
That is the stupidest thing
you've ever said.

09:06.279 --> 09:08.982
Impossible.

09:09.016 --> 09:12.720
Check it out.
Massage seats?

09:12.753 --> 09:13.987
(soft gasp)

09:14.021 --> 09:15.689
You feel that?

09:15.723 --> 09:16.957
Feel it?

09:16.990 --> 09:19.292
I'm ready to turn around
and straddle it.

09:21.862 --> 09:23.864
* I'll tell you what I want,
what I really, really want *

09:23.897 --> 09:26.133
* So tell me what you want,
what you really, really want *

09:26.166 --> 09:28.235
* I wanna, ha, I wanna, ha,
I wanna, ha, I wanna, ha *

09:28.268 --> 09:30.904
* I wanna really, really,
really wanna zigazig, ah *

09:30.938 --> 09:33.641
* If you wanna be my lover...

09:37.745 --> 09:40.648
So, married to a guy, huh?

09:40.681 --> 09:42.916
Yep.

09:42.950 --> 09:45.318
How is that?

09:45.352 --> 09:46.453
You know. Marriage.

09:46.486 --> 09:50.123
We fight over the remote
just like the rest of the world.

09:50.157 --> 09:52.726
Hmm. Ha.

09:52.760 --> 09:55.996
Do you guys share socks,
or do you have your own?

09:57.064 --> 09:58.165
We have our own.

09:58.198 --> 10:00.033
They get mixed up sometimes.

10:00.067 --> 10:01.702
Good question, though.

10:02.970 --> 10:04.772
Okay, my turn.

10:04.805 --> 10:06.073
Shoot.

10:06.106 --> 10:07.808
I'm assuming,
since you're with Bonnie,

10:07.841 --> 10:10.610
everything... works?

10:11.979 --> 10:13.881
Everything but the legs.

10:13.914 --> 10:16.817
So, you're pretty much
always on the bottom.

10:16.850 --> 10:19.019
Yeah.

10:20.087 --> 10:22.222
What do you guys do,
flip a coin?

10:26.193 --> 10:27.795
You said I could drive again.

10:27.828 --> 10:29.162
When do I get to drive again?

10:29.196 --> 10:32.700
I'm not gonna just
pull over on the freeway.

10:32.733 --> 10:33.834
(siren wailing)

10:33.867 --> 10:36.436
Or maybe I am.

10:36.469 --> 10:39.339
I didn't think rich people
got pulled over.

10:39.372 --> 10:41.308
Any chance he's just gonna
congratulate us

10:41.341 --> 10:43.677
on how well our lives
have turned out?

10:43.711 --> 10:45.412
Get the registration.

10:46.747 --> 10:47.848
(glove box opens)

10:47.881 --> 10:49.082
Oh, no.

10:49.116 --> 10:50.684
Relax. We haven't
done anything wrong.

10:50.718 --> 10:52.419
We're two law-abiding,
sober women...

10:52.452 --> 10:55.288
Who are carrying
about $300 worth of cocaine.

10:57.090 --> 10:58.959
Maybe it comes with the car.

11:05.766 --> 11:07.300
Are you sure it's coke?

11:07.334 --> 11:10.738
Either that, or Ray's gonna do
a teeny, tiny load of laundry.

11:10.771 --> 11:12.139
Get rid of that.

11:12.172 --> 11:13.373
(knocking on window)
(gasps)

11:16.309 --> 11:18.078
Be cool.

11:21.815 --> 11:23.083
Good evening, officer.

11:23.116 --> 11:24.918
License and registration.

11:24.952 --> 11:26.720
Absolutely.

11:26.754 --> 11:28.088
This is my brother's car.

11:28.121 --> 11:29.923
He's at a basketball game
with my boyfriend.

11:29.957 --> 11:32.192
He's in a wheelchair.
Not my brother, my boyfriend.

11:32.225 --> 11:33.460
My-my brother's black.

11:33.493 --> 11:35.128
I'm not saying that
because you're black.

11:35.162 --> 11:36.463
He's also gay, you might be gay.

11:36.496 --> 11:37.731
That's not my business.

11:37.765 --> 11:40.100
Anyway, here's the license.

11:41.301 --> 11:42.803
That's Christy,
she's my daughter.

11:42.836 --> 11:43.871
Say hi, Christy.

11:43.904 --> 11:45.172
Hello.

11:45.205 --> 11:47.074
Are you okay, ma'am?

11:47.107 --> 11:48.341
Menopause.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.210
Cold one second,
sweating balls the next,

11:50.243 --> 11:52.245
You'll see.
Not now, not for a while.

11:52.279 --> 11:55.082
Are you aware your driver's side
taillight is out?

11:55.115 --> 11:56.483
Again, uh, my brother's car.

11:56.516 --> 11:57.985
He's at a basketball game
with my boyfriend.

11:58.018 --> 11:59.086
I keep saying "boyfriend."

11:59.119 --> 12:01.021
He's really "fiancé," look. See?

12:01.054 --> 12:02.923
Congratulations.
Thank you.

12:02.956 --> 12:04.057
Be right back.

12:04.091 --> 12:05.092
Mm-hmm.

12:05.125 --> 12:06.226
Oh, my God.

12:06.259 --> 12:07.795
(exhaling):
Oh, my God.

12:10.063 --> 12:11.999
Okay, I don't want to alarm you,

12:12.032 --> 12:13.801
but I don't know
where the coke went.

12:13.834 --> 12:15.468
That is alarming.

12:15.502 --> 12:16.503
Don't worry.

12:16.536 --> 12:19.406
Finding drugs in the dark
is, like, my superpower.

12:19.439 --> 12:20.473
Hold on.

12:20.507 --> 12:21.975
(sighs)

12:22.009 --> 12:23.143
Find it?

12:23.176 --> 12:25.478
Nope. Just a big bag of pot.

12:25.512 --> 12:27.815
(gasps)
She's coming back.

12:29.883 --> 12:31.084
All right, ma'am.
Oh...

12:31.118 --> 12:32.385
Hello again.

12:32.419 --> 12:36.123
Make sure your brother
gets that taillight fixed.

12:36.156 --> 12:37.557
And you ladies have
a good night.

12:37.590 --> 12:38.859
Thank you.

12:38.892 --> 12:39.893
Thank you. Thank you!

12:39.927 --> 12:40.961
Too many thank yous.

12:40.994 --> 12:43.163
Thank you.

12:45.165 --> 12:46.399
(both sigh)

12:46.433 --> 12:48.936
Okay. Your turn to drive.

12:53.006 --> 12:54.507
What happened to us?

12:54.541 --> 12:56.309
We used to smuggle
suitcases of this stuff

12:56.343 --> 12:57.911
without breaking a sweat.

12:57.945 --> 12:59.880
Mm. We've gone soft.

13:00.948 --> 13:02.049
We're worse than soft.

13:02.082 --> 13:03.150
We're civilians.

13:03.183 --> 13:04.351
You shut your mouth.

13:06.386 --> 13:08.989
I'm not even a little
bit tempted to use it.

13:09.022 --> 13:12.225
Mm. I'm a little tempted
to sell it.

13:14.261 --> 13:16.596
Something about that
comforts me.

13:16.629 --> 13:18.031
(door opens)

13:18.065 --> 13:19.532
(both laughing)
Crazy.

13:19.566 --> 13:22.502
Hey.
Adam bought me a shirt!

13:27.074 --> 13:27.941
Something wrong?

13:27.975 --> 13:29.877
Very.

13:29.910 --> 13:32.479
Something I did?

13:32.512 --> 13:33.280
No.

13:33.313 --> 13:35.382
Great. Good luck, buddy.

13:39.987 --> 13:41.288
What's up?

13:41.321 --> 13:43.924
You tell us.

13:43.957 --> 13:45.092
What's that?

13:45.125 --> 13:47.094
Oh, come on, Ray.

13:47.127 --> 13:48.428
We found it in your car.

13:48.461 --> 13:49.429
What were you
doing in my car?

13:49.462 --> 13:52.199
I'm asking
the questions here.

13:52.232 --> 13:53.967
So why does a guy
who's been sober three months

13:54.001 --> 13:55.502
have coke and weed
in his car?

13:58.205 --> 13:59.406
I must've just forgot about it.

13:59.439 --> 14:01.208
Oh, because that's
a thing that happens.

14:01.241 --> 14:04.945
Nobody forgets about
three grams of blow.

14:04.978 --> 14:07.314
Unless they've smoked
a giant bag of weed.

14:10.683 --> 14:13.420
Come on, admit it,
you're still getting high.

14:15.222 --> 14:17.557
Occasionally.

14:17.590 --> 14:19.893
In the last three months,
did you go to any meetings?

14:19.927 --> 14:21.194
Yeah. A few.

14:21.228 --> 14:24.097
And I realized
I don't have a problem.

14:24.131 --> 14:25.098
Have you gone...

14:25.132 --> 14:26.934
I don't have a problem.

14:28.268 --> 14:29.302
I just didn't tell you

14:29.336 --> 14:30.603
because I knew you'd overreact.

14:30.637 --> 14:32.572
Does David know
you're still using?

14:32.605 --> 14:33.573
Yeah.

14:33.606 --> 14:35.308
And?

14:35.342 --> 14:38.478
David and I are on a break.

14:38.511 --> 14:40.613
Well, guess what, buddy,
if you want to keep using,

14:40.647 --> 14:42.482
we're gonna be
on a break, too.

14:44.284 --> 14:46.053
Listen to you.

14:46.086 --> 14:48.455
Straight up Marjorie.

14:48.488 --> 14:52.059
Yeah. Could the day
get any worse?

14:54.061 --> 14:56.096
(sighs) This brings back
memories, doesn't it?

14:56.129 --> 14:59.632
Yeah. You can almost hear
the cops banging on the door.

14:59.666 --> 15:00.567
(chuckles)

15:00.600 --> 15:04.204
Dogs barking, helicopters
circling overhead.

15:04.237 --> 15:05.472
There were never helicopters.

15:05.505 --> 15:07.440
You were just really high.

15:09.476 --> 15:12.579
Mm. #Sad.
(toilet flushes)

15:14.514 --> 15:17.717
There's gonna be a party
in Fish Town tonight.

15:17.750 --> 15:20.320
Okay, so tomorrow, we'll
take Ray to a meeting.

15:20.353 --> 15:22.089
In his car.
And I'll drive.

15:22.122 --> 15:23.356
Not happening.

15:23.390 --> 15:24.624
(water bubbling)

15:24.657 --> 15:27.660
Uh-oh, the drugs
are coming back.

15:27.694 --> 15:29.362
How about that.
After all these years,

15:29.396 --> 15:31.464
the toilet's finally
throwing up on us.

15:35.535 --> 15:37.237
Hey.

15:37.270 --> 15:39.072
Uh, hey.

15:39.106 --> 15:40.540
Want some coffee?

15:40.573 --> 15:42.042
Uh, you know, I'm gonna pass.

15:42.075 --> 15:43.276
I got to head out.

15:43.310 --> 15:46.579
Oh, really?

15:46.613 --> 15:50.217
Thought we were gonna have
that hot sauce eating contest.

15:50.250 --> 15:52.185
Rain check.

15:52.219 --> 15:54.621
Listen, I don't want to wake up
Bonnie and Christy.

15:54.654 --> 15:56.256
Would you thank them for me?

15:56.289 --> 15:58.725
Uh, sure, but, uh,
what's the rush?

16:00.193 --> 16:02.162
I just got to go.

16:02.195 --> 16:04.131
Okay.

16:04.164 --> 16:05.265
Call me.

16:05.298 --> 16:08.001
(door closes)

16:12.239 --> 16:14.574
Where's Ray?
He left.

16:14.607 --> 16:16.743
What? We're supposed
to go to a meeting.

16:16.776 --> 16:19.046
I don't know what to tell you,
Bonnie. He's gone.

16:20.147 --> 16:21.181
Who's gone?

16:21.214 --> 16:22.215
Ray.

16:22.249 --> 16:23.616
Gone gone?

16:23.650 --> 16:25.618
Yeah, he took his bag.

16:25.652 --> 16:28.221
(sighing):
Oh, damn it.

16:28.255 --> 16:29.622
Yeah.

16:31.224 --> 16:33.426
I thought of trying
to talk him into staying,

16:33.460 --> 16:35.028
but didn't really know
what to say to him.

16:35.062 --> 16:37.030
There's nothing
you could've said.

16:42.402 --> 16:43.603
I had a gay black friend.

16:43.636 --> 16:46.573
That was gonna be my thing
this year.

16:53.280 --> 16:56.416
Hey, Natasha.
Getting used to the new job?

16:56.449 --> 16:58.051
No. You know
what's more disgusting

16:58.085 --> 17:00.220
than the food people leave
behind on their plates?

17:00.253 --> 17:01.488
Having to pick through that food

17:01.521 --> 17:03.690
to find some
stupid kid's retainer.

17:03.723 --> 17:06.793
Oh! I always used
to lose my retainer.

17:06.826 --> 17:08.661
Then my mom gave me
a little plastic bag

17:08.695 --> 17:10.163
to put it in when I was...

17:10.197 --> 17:11.564
What is wrong with you?

17:14.334 --> 17:18.271
Don't take it personally,
she's still pretty raw.

17:18.305 --> 17:21.574
I'm with Natasha,
that story was going nowhere.

17:23.510 --> 17:25.278
Have you guys heard
from Ray?

17:25.312 --> 17:26.846
Nope.

17:26.879 --> 17:30.049
I talked to his husband, but
they haven't spoken in weeks.

17:31.318 --> 17:32.752
He did say Ray lost his job,

17:32.785 --> 17:34.721
and owes money
all over the place.

17:34.754 --> 17:36.789
You forget how hard it is
to get sober.

17:36.823 --> 17:40.593
I'm afraid the next time we hear
from him, he's gonna be in jail.

17:42.129 --> 17:43.196
Or worse.

17:44.397 --> 17:46.799
Well, not everybody
makes it.

17:50.603 --> 17:52.272
Thank you.

17:52.305 --> 17:53.340
Oh.

17:53.373 --> 17:55.242
Sure.

17:58.245 --> 17:59.846
Mm.

17:59.879 --> 18:02.215
She got ketchup
on your shoulder.
