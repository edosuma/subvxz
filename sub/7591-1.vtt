Thought you had him under surveillance.

I'm Keller Dover.

01:48:42.080 --> 01:48:46.608
My little girl was abducted with a friend.

01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:50.404
What do you want?

01:48:51.440 --> 01:48:53.090
Uh...

01:48:56.280 --> 01:49:00.046
I guess I haven't thought
this through too good, huh? I...

01:49:00.840 --> 01:49:04.003
I been thinking a lot about
what happened to your nephew.

01:49:05.080 --> 01:49:08.801
And I know I scared him the other day
at the police station, and...

01:49:10.280 --> 01:49:14.126
What I'm trying to say is I kind of feel
responsible for him running away.

01:49:17.080 --> 01:49:19.481
You wanna come on in?

01:49:19.800 --> 01:49:21.165
Yeah.

01:49:30.800 --> 01:49:36.170
My husband and I were
very devout at one time.

01:49:37.480 --> 01:49:42.168
Spent our summers driving around
in that camper with our son...

01:49:43.040 --> 01:49:45.327
...handing out pamphlets.

01:49:46.600 --> 01:49:48.921
Spreading the good word.

01:49:51.520 --> 01:49:54.888
After our son died of cancer...

01:49:55.160 --> 01:49:57.925
...we started seeing things differently.

01:49:59.160 --> 01:50:01.162
Adopting Alex helped...

01:50:01.960 --> 01:50:04.281
...but we never got over it.

01:50:05.400 --> 01:50:06.970
I'm sorry.

01:50:09.640 --> 01:50:12.166
You look very tired.

01:50:14.360 --> 01:50:16.567
Yeah, I don't sleep much.

01:50:17.640 --> 01:50:19.324
I, uh...

01:50:21.360 --> 01:50:24.204
I keep dreaming about being lost in a maze.

01:50:27.800 --> 01:50:29.962
I'm sorry. Heh.

01:50:30.560 --> 01:50:32.801
Alex never talks very much...

01:50:32.960 --> 01:50:36.043
...so when people come over here,
I hardly know what to say.

01:50:36.200 --> 01:50:37.247
He doesn't talk much?

01:50:37.440 --> 01:50:40.728
Well, he talks. Good morning,
good night, that sort of thing.

01:50:40.880 --> 01:50:43.804
Hard to get too much
more than that out of him.

01:50:45.240 --> 01:50:47.402
Had an accident when he was little.

01:50:47.560 --> 01:50:51.531
After that he started choosing his words
a little too carefully.

01:50:51.680 --> 01:50:55.048
- What...? What kind of accident did he...?
- Oh.

01:50:55.760 --> 01:50:58.240
My husband kept snakes.

01:50:58.400 --> 01:51:02.803
It wasn't that bad what happened,
but Alex had a fear of them and...

01:51:03.680 --> 01:51:05.921
That's not my favorite memory.

01:51:06.760 --> 01:51:09.684
I'm sorry. It's none of my business.

01:51:10.120 --> 01:51:11.610
Oh.

Can I get you a cup of tea, Mr. Dover?

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:24.161
Oh.

01:51:24.360 --> 01:51:27.762
Oh, I'm so sorry. I thought you
would have known about that already.

01:51:28.840 --> 01:51:31.411
I say it's better this way.
You know, that awful man...

01:51:31.560 --> 01:51:36.646
...he would have spent years on Death Row
just watching TV and getting fat.

01:51:40.800 --> 01:51:42.290
Well.

about losing you to P.S.P.

Two kid-sized department store
mannequins, with their heads caved in.

01:54:03.920 --> 01:54:08.050
I talked to our lab. They told me the blood
we sampled from the plastic containers?

01:54:08.200 --> 01:54:09.850
Pig's blood.

01:54:10.680 --> 01:54:14.765
Let's get this covered up.
It's supposed to snow soon. Hurry up, okay?

01:54:17.600 --> 01:54:19.841
It's like he's play-acting. Case in point:

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.685
Except for the items ID'd
by the Dovers and the Birches...

01:54:22.840 --> 01:54:25.923
...all the kids' clothes that we found
still had tags on them.

01:54:26.080 --> 01:54:28.447
And that maze book that we found,
he made it.

01:54:28.600 --> 01:54:31.285
Photocopies, pictures from this book
we found in the attic.

01:54:31.440 --> 01:54:34.887
- Ex-FBI agent wrote that.
- "Finding the Invisible Man."

01:54:35.040 --> 01:54:39.125
It's about a theoretical suspect he believed
was responsible for a bunch of abductions.

01:54:39.280 --> 01:54:42.966
It's totally discredited,
I guess, but I read some of it.

01:54:43.120 --> 01:54:46.488
Taylor was abducted when he was a kid.
He ran away after three weeks.

01:54:46.640 --> 01:54:49.883
The captor drugged him on some
sort of LSD/Ketamine cocktail.

01:54:50.040 --> 01:54:52.566
He never remembered
and they never caught the guy.

01:54:52.720 --> 01:54:57.567
Okay, so, he read the book and decided
he was taken by the Invisible Man.

01:54:57.720 --> 01:55:00.769
Now he's doing his best imitation, right?

01:55:03.080 --> 01:55:06.971
Yeah, he was doing his best imitation.
He killed himself last night.

01:55:07.920 --> 01:55:10.127
How did he do that?
I thought he was in custody.

01:55:14.920 --> 01:55:16.331
Hey.

01:55:18.320 --> 01:55:20.641
Taylor drew this. It's a map to the bodies.

01:55:20.800 --> 01:55:22.165
It's a map to the bodies.

01:55:22.320 --> 01:55:25.324
We found the same design
on a pendant we pulled off that corpse.

01:55:25.520 --> 01:55:27.682
- There's a connection, okay?
- Connection is...

01:55:27.840 --> 01:55:31.367
...that it's the last maze in the book.
It's unsolvable. There's no way out.

01:55:31.520 --> 01:55:35.081
Your corpse is another wannabe,
read the book.

01:55:37.760 --> 01:55:39.922

01:55:40.080 --> 01:55:43.084
You're saying that the girls
are still out there somewhere?

01:55:43.240 --> 01:55:45.163
How did Bob Taylor get those clothes?

01:55:45.320 --> 01:55:48.130
How did...? How did the parents...
