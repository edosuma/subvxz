08:51.772 --> 08:53.473
No, we can't look at
them without a psychologist

08:53.541 --> 08:55.408
to protect patient confidentiality.

08:55.476 --> 08:58.375
Perfect! I have just the psychologist!

08:58.376 --> 09:00.747
Dr. Linda Martin, from our first
investigation together.

09:00.815 --> 09:02.182
The one that wanted to jump your bones?

09:02.250 --> 09:03.250
- Yeah.
- No. Not happening.

09:03.284 --> 09:04.317
No, I really think she'd bring some

09:04.385 --> 09:05.886
impressive insight into the issues

09:05.953 --> 09:06.987
that you're dealing with.

09:07.054 --> 09:08.388
Uh, in the case.

09:08.456 --> 09:10.176
I really don't. Plus,
it's out of our hands.

09:10.191 --> 09:12.592
Court-appointed. A
judge needs to sign off.

09:17.732 --> 09:19.599
♪ ♪

09:25.740 --> 09:28.241
Wonderful! Now...

09:28.309 --> 09:30.343
I see you brought your
gavel, like I asked.

09:31.612 --> 09:33.980
(Lucifer sighs passionately)

09:34.048 --> 09:35.048
(Michelle laughs)

09:35.082 --> 09:36.316
MICHELLE: Oh!

09:36.384 --> 09:38.618
LUCIFER: Oh, objection, Your Honor.

Ah! Now, now...

09:50.755 --> 09:51.755
Oh, come on!

09:51.790 --> 09:53.023
I won't tell if you won't.

09:53.091 --> 09:55.326
I swore an oath... to a judge.

09:55.393 --> 09:56.627
Oh, did you now?

09:56.695 --> 09:57.761
You only get to read the files

09:57.829 --> 09:59.230
I deem necessary for investigation.

09:59.297 --> 10:00.598
(scoffs, sighs)

10:00.665 --> 10:02.466
Now, remember our deal.

10:02.534 --> 10:04.668
You have to fix the
detective's broken douche meter

10:04.736 --> 10:06.496
- whilst we investigate this crime.
- Mm-hmm.

10:06.504 --> 10:08.606
I never agreed to that. Oh, come now.

10:08.673 --> 10:10.174
Don't you want to help me?

10:12.777 --> 10:13.911
Hmm? Linda?

10:13.979 --> 10:15.613
(sultry chuckle)

10:15.680 --> 10:16.847
Lucifer...

10:16.915 --> 10:18.716
Ah! Speak of the me.

10:18.783 --> 10:21.051
Out here. Now.

10:26.558 --> 10:27.558
What did you do?

10:27.625 --> 10:29.065
Not what, but who, if you must know.

10:29.127 --> 10:30.627
But I try not to kiss and tell.

10:30.695 --> 10:33.297
I told you I didn't
want to go with Dr. Martin.

10:33.364 --> 10:35.666
We need someone impartial, which means

10:35.733 --> 10:38.235
not trying to get in
your pants. What...?

10:38.303 --> 10:39.837
Are you even listening to me?

10:39.904 --> 10:41.104
Not really. Look.

10:41.172 --> 10:43.540
A new doctor's moved in.

10:43.608 --> 10:45.609
Dr. Canaan.

10:45.677 --> 10:47.377
How Biblical.

10:47.545 --> 10:49.947
Sure, let's add another random
doctor to the case.

10:50.014 --> 10:51.348
Great idea.

10:51.416 --> 10:54.651
Now, look, I assure
you, Dr. Martin is excellent.

10:54.719 --> 10:56.687
She trained at
Stanford, she lectures at USC,

10:56.754 --> 10:58.221
she's got stacks of awards...

10:58.289 --> 11:00.257
Since when are you her fanboy?

11:00.325 --> 11:01.491
Since I became a client.

11:01.559 --> 11:02.826
You.

11:02.894 --> 11:03.961
You're really in therapy?

11:04.028 --> 11:05.696
Why is that so surprising?

11:05.763 --> 11:07.130
You're the least reflective
person I know.

11:07.198 --> 11:08.198
I have layers.

11:08.266 --> 11:09.866
I'm like an onion.

11:09.934 --> 11:11.468
An irresistible one.

11:11.536 --> 11:12.836
Dr. Linda

11:12.904 --> 11:14.838
said we recently made a
breakthrough, in fact.

11:14.906 --> 11:16.773
Why do I think that's code for sex?

11:16.841 --> 11:18.475
In that particular context, no.

11:18.543 --> 11:20.043
Do you still think you're the Devil?

11:20.111 --> 11:21.278
I am the Devil.

11:21.346 --> 11:23.680
Then excuse me if I doubt her skills.

11:23.748 --> 11:25.068
Look, she's helped me, all right?

11:25.116 --> 11:26.316
And I think she can be of help here.

11:26.384 --> 11:28.018
- Uh-huh, I'm sure.
- Excuse me.

11:28.086 --> 11:29.920
- Everything okay?
- Yes, Linda,

11:29.988 --> 11:31.321
everything's absolutely
fine... No offense, Dr. Martin...

11:31.389 --> 11:32.756
I found something.

11:32.824 --> 11:34.157
- Hello.
- What is it?

11:34.225 --> 11:35.759
A patient named Richard Kester.

11:35.827 --> 11:38.195
His wife convinced him to
try Dr. Shaw's therapy.

11:38.262 --> 11:39.763
Hmm, let me guess... didn't end well?

11:39.831 --> 11:41.131
She had an affair.

11:41.199 --> 11:42.332
They got divorced.

11:42.400 --> 11:45.002
And then Richard sent Dr.
Shaw a death threat.

11:45.069 --> 11:47.738
It's been more than a
year, but that kind of anger

11:47.805 --> 11:49.239
can bubble up when you least expect it.

11:49.307 --> 11:51.708
Add him to the list of angry patients.

11:51.776 --> 11:52.609
That's just it.

11:52.677 --> 11:54.611
Richard's the only one so far.

11:54.679 --> 11:57.047
Dr. Shaw's patients seem
remarkably happy with him.

11:57.115 --> 11:58.148
Oh, do they now?

11:58.216 --> 12:00.083
See, cheater therapy works.

12:00.151 --> 12:04.121
Maybe you should've tried
it with Detective Douche.

12:04.188 --> 12:07.424
Or was that what broke you apart?

12:08.426 --> 12:10.833
What is wrong with you lately?

12:11.929 --> 12:13.597
I'll look into him.

12:13.665 --> 12:15.499
Thank you.

12:15.566 --> 12:16.767
Yeah.

12:16.834 --> 12:17.834
Top work, Sherlock.

12:19.570 --> 12:21.705
(sighs)

12:23.107 --> 12:24.775
<i>So I don't understand</i>

12:24.842 --> 12:25.876
all this jealousy talk.

12:25.943 --> 12:28.839
I mean, why covet
something someone else has?

12:28.840 --> 12:29.413
Why not just take it?

12:29.480 --> 12:31.314
(chuckles) 'Cause it's never that easy.

12:31.382 --> 12:33.617
Well, it is for me.

12:33.685 --> 12:35.585
Usually.

12:37.889 --> 12:39.322
I, uh, I may have overstepped

12:39.390 --> 12:41.658
earlier in regards to Detective Douche.

12:41.726 --> 12:42.793
(laughs) Yeah.

12:42.860 --> 12:44.461
You definitely may have.

12:44.529 --> 12:48.953
So why did you two separate anyway?

12:50.101 --> 12:51.501
(chuckles)

12:51.569 --> 12:53.336
(sighs)

12:53.404 --> 12:55.906
The job was more
important to him than me and Trixie.

12:55.973 --> 12:57.908
But lately something's changed.

12:57.975 --> 13:01.512
He... he makes time for me.

13:01.513 --> 13:02.446
He makes time for us.

13:02.513 --> 13:04.915
He's really putting in an effort.

13:04.982 --> 13:07.250
Yes, if ever anyone deserved

13:07.318 --> 13:09.753
a participation trophy, it's Dan.

13:16.194 --> 13:19.859
(phone ringing)

13:20.164 --> 13:21.198
Decker.

13:21.265 --> 13:22.265
LINDA: Uh, hello, Detective.

13:22.333 --> 13:23.333
It's about Richard.

13:23.401 --> 13:24.401
I wanted to warn you.

13:24.435 --> 13:25.869
He may be unstable.

13:25.937 --> 13:27.370
Possibly dangerous.

13:27.438 --> 13:28.905
I'll handle it, but thanks.

13:28.973 --> 13:30.173
I don't mean to you.

13:30.241 --> 13:31.641
I mean to himself.

13:31.709 --> 13:32.976
(siren whoops)

13:33.044 --> 13:34.177
(indistinct radio transmission)

13:34.245 --> 13:36.580
Yeah, you may be right.

13:36.647 --> 13:38.014
Lucifer?

13:38.082 --> 13:39.416
Oh, my God.

13:39.484 --> 13:40.717
There's another one.

13:40.785 --> 13:41.918
LUCIFER: Hey, Detective!

13:41.986 --> 13:44.721
You need your roots done!

13:55.309 --> 13:56.743
I've made up my mind.

13:56.811 --> 13:58.712
You can't stop me.

13:58.779 --> 14:00.547
What? Oh, no. I'm not here to stop you.

14:00.614 --> 14:02.349
If you want to jump, go for it.

14:03.584 --> 14:06.653
Is this some kind of reverse psychology?

14:06.721 --> 14:07.887
No, quite serious.

14:07.955 --> 14:08.955
Go for it.

14:08.956 --> 14:12.298
Okay, here goes.

14:12.299 --> 14:13.526
I do have one
question before you pop off.

14:13.594 --> 14:15.562
You see, I'm trying to
understand jealousy.

14:15.629 --> 14:17.764
It's a new concept to me.

14:17.832 --> 14:20.900
And you, dear Ricky, are the
perfect person to explain it.

14:20.968 --> 14:23.203
- What are you talking about...?
- Manners, Ricky.

14:23.270 --> 14:24.170
Manners! (Richard screaming)

14:24.238 --> 14:25.405
We're not done talking yet!

14:25.473 --> 14:26.806
Okay, I'll talk!!

14:26.874 --> 14:28.608
Pull me back up, please!

14:28.676 --> 14:30.910
Are you sure? Yeah?
'Cause I could just...

14:30.978 --> 14:33.313
(screams) Pull me back up!

14:33.381 --> 14:35.648
Pull me up, please!

14:38.919 --> 14:40.120
Oh, God.

14:40.187 --> 14:41.587
I'd save your breath if I were you.

14:41.622 --> 14:44.190
When it comes to this sort
of thing, he's quite judgy.

14:44.258 --> 14:46.826
Right, back to the matter in hand.

14:46.894 --> 14:49.929
Now, you were so jealous that
you murdered Dr. Shaw.

14:49.997 --> 14:51.237
Can you help me understand why?

14:51.298 --> 14:53.566
How could you say that?

14:53.634 --> 14:55.769
I was about to jump, because he's dead.

14:55.836 --> 14:57.203
Don't fib, Rickster.

14:57.271 --> 14:58.405
I know about your death threats.

14:58.472 --> 15:01.274
(scoffs) I was in a bad place.

15:01.342 --> 15:02.876
Kara had just dumped me.

15:02.943 --> 15:04.210
I made my threats.

15:04.278 --> 15:05.745
Then I went to his office...

15:05.813 --> 15:07.147
And killed him.

15:07.214 --> 15:08.648
And he talked me down.

15:08.716 --> 15:10.984
And afterwards, he kept seeing me,

15:11.052 --> 15:13.620
even though he knew I
couldn't afford to pay him.

15:13.687 --> 15:16.156
I mean, he'd got me through
my divorce, bankruptcy,

15:16.223 --> 15:17.791
the death of my parrot.

15:17.858 --> 15:20.947
Oh, I've just realized

15:20.948 --> 15:21.394
you're not jealous, are you?

15:21.462 --> 15:23.163
You're just sad.

15:23.230 --> 15:24.898
Pathetic, really.

15:24.965 --> 15:28.334
(sighs) Well, if you can't
tell me what I need to know,

15:28.335 --> 15:28.968
what good are you?

15:29.036 --> 15:31.471
Aren't you supposed to tell
me that I have a lot to live for?

15:31.539 --> 15:32.539
Well, I wish I could, Ricky,

15:32.606 --> 15:34.841
but your life sounds incredibly bleak.

15:34.909 --> 15:37.744
Ironically, it seems
there's nowhere to go but up.

15:39.647 --> 15:42.248
(sighs)

15:42.316 --> 15:43.783
You know what? You're right.

15:43.851 --> 15:45.218
Hmm?

15:45.286 --> 15:47.921
Maybe the worst is behind me.

15:47.988 --> 15:49.522
Hmm.

15:49.590 --> 15:51.324
I think I'm ready to go in now.

15:51.392 --> 15:52.992
Well, I wasn't asking, but, uh,

15:53.060 --> 15:55.195
all right, go on, quick as you can.

15:55.262 --> 15:57.163
Come on, chop, chop.

15:57.231 --> 16:00.266

16:00.334 --> 16:02.035
CHLOE: I can't believe you, Lucifer.

16:02.103 --> 16:03.803
LUCIFER: What? You
should be thanking me.

16:03.871 --> 16:07.407
All right, Richard, we
confirmed your alibi with your neighbor.

16:07.475 --> 16:09.008
You're free to go.

16:09.076 --> 16:10.810
How did this happen?

16:10.878 --> 16:12.278
Poor Sandy.

16:12.346 --> 16:13.246
Who's Sandy?

16:13.314 --> 16:15.415
Dr. Shaw's wife, Alexandra.

16:15.483 --> 16:17.717
Her friends all call her Sandy.

16:17.785 --> 16:20.887
Okay, and you're friends with
your therapist's wife?

16:20.955 --> 16:24.057
Yes, how open was his
relationship therapy, hmm?

16:24.125 --> 16:26.326
No, it's nothing like that.

16:26.393 --> 16:27.994
That's just how the Shaws are.

16:28.062 --> 16:30.697
They go above and beyond.

16:30.764 --> 16:32.932
I just ran into her two days ago.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.901
Sandy was planning a surprise

16:34.969 --> 16:36.970
for Dr. Shaw and everything.

16:37.037 --> 16:39.237
You ran into her two days
ago... are you sure about that?

16:39.273 --> 16:40.406
Yeah.

16:40.474 --> 16:42.809
Alexandra told us she was in Phoenix.

16:42.877 --> 16:43.776
We checked her alibi.

16:43.844 --> 16:44.944
She had plane tickets to prove it.

16:45.012 --> 16:46.179
What was the surprise?

16:46.247 --> 16:47.580
I don't know.

16:47.648 --> 16:49.849
She just asked me not to
tell Dr. Shaw she was in town.

16:49.917 --> 16:52.018
(chuckles): Uh-huh.

16:52.086 --> 16:54.554

17:52.413 --> 17:55.014
Terrified of not being in control.

17:55.082 --> 17:56.950
But that's not you, I'm sure.

17:57.017 --> 17:59.519
I like you.

17:59.587 --> 18:01.387
♪ I am a fool... ♪

18:01.455 --> 18:03.223
LUCIFER: Doctor?

18:03.290 --> 18:06.092
What a surprise.

18:06.160 --> 18:07.694
What are you doing here?

18:07.761 --> 18:09.028
I thought you asked me to meet you here.

18:09.096 --> 18:10.930
That-that was me. I felt like

18:10.998 --> 18:13.700
it would be good to get
your input on the case.

18:13.767 --> 18:15.702
CHLOE: That's a good
idea, actually, especially

18:15.769 --> 18:17.971
since our last suspect almost
ended up sidewalk art.

18:18.038 --> 18:20.473
Turns out Mrs. Shaw flew to Phoenix

18:20.541 --> 18:23.109
but rented a car and
drove back a couple days early.

18:23.177 --> 18:25.245
LUCIFER: So, dear, sweet Sandy was here

18:25.312 --> 18:26.913
just in time for the murder.

18:26.981 --> 18:30.472
Wait, Alexandra Shaw goes by "Sandy"?

18:30.918 --> 18:32.619
The doctor had a female
patient who was stalked

18:32.686 --> 18:35.388
by someone with the initials S.S.

18:35.456 --> 18:37.123
He used initials in his notes?

18:37.191 --> 18:38.324
I found it odd as well.

18:38.392 --> 18:41.127
Why conceal someone's
identity in private notes?

18:41.195 --> 18:43.663
But I thought it wasn't related, so I...

18:43.731 --> 18:47.433
Unless S.S. stands for Sandy Shaw.

18:47.501 --> 18:48.668
If she was stalking

18:48.736 --> 18:50.637
one of her husband's female patients...

18:50.704 --> 18:52.038
Then maybe Dr. Shaw

18:52.106 --> 18:54.073
was engaged in his own

18:54.141 --> 18:55.208
open-relationship therapy.

18:55.276 --> 18:56.476
CHLOE: Sandy found out.

18:56.543 --> 18:57.744
So maybe she wasn't

18:57.811 --> 18:58.845
okay with it as she claimed.

18:58.912 --> 19:00.647
- (phone rings)
- Excuse me.

19:01.749 --> 19:03.082
Decker.

19:03.150 --> 19:05.418
Yeah, this is 831.

19:05.486 --> 19:08.821
Oh, yeah, tell him I'll
be there as soon as I can.

19:08.889 --> 19:10.323
Okay, thank you.

19:11.191 --> 19:12.625
That was dispatch.

19:12.693 --> 19:13.760
Dan's phone died,

19:13.827 --> 19:15.228
and he wants me to meet him at my place.

19:15.296 --> 19:16.629
Apparently it's urgent.

19:16.697 --> 19:17.864
Oh, how convenient.

19:17.931 --> 19:19.232
What's next... he
spills something on his shirt

19:19.300 --> 19:20.366
and he has to take it off?

19:20.434 --> 19:23.069
Oh, no, the trousers, too.

19:23.137 --> 19:24.637
- What?
- What, so that's it?

19:24.705 --> 19:26.305
You just go running
as soon as Dan calls?

19:26.340 --> 19:27.573
What about the case?

19:27.641 --> 19:29.561
This could relate to
another case I'm working on.

19:29.576 --> 19:31.344
There's units looking for Sandy now.

19:31.412 --> 19:33.012
And once they find her, they'll call me.

19:33.080 --> 19:34.514
Bye.

19:34.581 --> 19:35.581
Bye.

19:35.616 --> 19:36.849
Unbelievable.

19:36.917 --> 19:38.677
You see what I'm
dealing with now, don't you?

19:38.686 --> 19:42.121
I think I do, actually.

19:42.189 --> 19:44.557
It's worse than I realized.

19:44.625 --> 19:46.859
Thank you.

19:53.600 --> 19:56.235
Hey, Dan.

19:56.303 --> 19:58.104
What did you find out?

19:58.172 --> 19:59.539
Surprise.

20:09.516 --> 20:12.029
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
hey! I just wanted to talk.

20:12.097 --> 20:14.814
You act all chummy in public,

20:14.815 --> 20:15.968
then you break into my home,

20:15.969 --> 20:17.201
trick me into meeting you in private?

20:17.268 --> 20:20.037
Excuse me if I'm not trusting.

20:20.105 --> 20:22.339
Hey, I'm not armed.

20:22.407 --> 20:24.641
All right? Hey.

20:25.877 --> 20:28.579
Huh? It's nothing like that.

20:30.115 --> 20:32.272
All right.

20:33.218 --> 20:34.885
Then talk.

20:34.953 --> 20:37.021
I had to meet with you where
no one else could hear.

20:37.088 --> 20:38.689
Hear what... my screams?

20:38.757 --> 20:39.556
(chuckles)

20:39.624 --> 20:42.726
Decker, we're on the same side.

20:42.794 --> 20:44.461
And I know you're
still looking into Palmetto.

20:44.529 --> 20:46.397
Well, guess what? So am I.

20:46.464 --> 20:48.232
I put that to bed a long time ago.

20:48.299 --> 20:49.800
That the best you got?

20:49.868 --> 20:53.037
God, you're a decent cop, but
you are a terrible liar.

20:53.104 --> 20:55.272
Come on!

20:55.340 --> 20:56.540
Palmetto stinks.

20:56.608 --> 20:57.975
I should know. I was there.

20:58.043 --> 20:59.843
Mm-hmm.

20:59.911 --> 21:02.012
Go ahead, say it.

21:02.080 --> 21:03.647
I look dirty.

21:03.715 --> 21:06.116
I saw you meet with Nikolas Aoudi.

21:06.184 --> 21:07.885
You were laughing.

21:07.952 --> 21:09.520
I saw you hand him cash.

21:09.587 --> 21:11.455
I've used him as a CI before.

21:11.523 --> 21:13.557
I was buying information.

21:13.625 --> 21:16.794
Then we both got shot.

21:16.861 --> 21:20.384
And I think it was a cop who shot me.

21:21.466 --> 21:23.333
But you knew that already, didn't you?

21:23.401 --> 21:24.668
Why do you think it was a cop?

21:24.736 --> 21:26.370
That's what I was paying Aoudi for.

21:26.438 --> 21:28.439
Intel on someone crooked at our station.

21:28.506 --> 21:30.474
But I think he or she got to me first.

21:30.542 --> 21:32.209
That's... (laughs)

21:32.277 --> 21:33.777
that's a great story.

21:33.845 --> 21:34.945
I love the ending.

21:35.013 --> 21:37.014
It-it ties up all the loose ends.

21:37.082 --> 21:38.348
Not really.

21:38.416 --> 21:39.817
I can't explain

21:39.884 --> 21:43.387
how the crooked cop knew I was there.

21:44.489 --> 21:46.290
How'd you find me?

21:46.357 --> 21:48.092
I followed the smell.

21:48.159 --> 21:49.399
(chuckling) You followed the...

21:49.461 --> 21:50.861
You know what?

21:50.929 --> 21:52.262
Screw this.

21:52.330 --> 21:53.831
I only called you to try and help.

21:53.898 --> 21:54.765
Really?

21:54.833 --> 21:56.433
Yeah, really.

21:56.501 --> 21:59.036
Listen, Decker, they
pulled the plug on me.

21:59.104 --> 22:02.239
Malcolm...

22:02.307 --> 22:03.874
I was dead.

22:03.942 --> 22:06.043
I-I know.

22:06.111 --> 22:10.214
Made me appreciate the
time I've got here.

22:10.281 --> 22:12.282
So, personally, I don't think

22:12.350 --> 22:15.786
I'm gonna dig any deeper on this one.

22:15.854 --> 22:17.788
And I wouldn't if I were you either.

22:17.856 --> 22:20.524
Not sure if that's a
warning or a threat.

22:20.592 --> 22:23.227
I'm not the enemy, Chloe.

22:23.294 --> 22:25.395
But whoever we were investigating,

22:25.463 --> 22:27.664
they're still out there.

22:27.732 --> 22:31.557
And they clearly don't
have a problem shooting cops.

22:35.073 --> 22:37.908
(phone ringing)

22:37.976 --> 22:39.042
(door closes)

22:39.110 --> 22:40.844
Decker.

22:41.913 --> 22:43.413
<i>CHLOE: Unis found Sandy Shaw</i>

22:43.481 --> 22:44.915
in her car in a parking structure.

22:44.983 --> 22:46.350
Oh, well, I hope our case

22:46.417 --> 22:48.652
didn't ruin your kissy-time with Dan.

22:48.720 --> 22:51.021
What is with your recent obsession
with my love life?

22:51.089 --> 22:52.356
Obsession? (laughs)

22:52.423 --> 22:53.891
That's awfully defensive.

22:53.958 --> 22:56.126
Probably indicates deeper
issues, wouldn't you say?

22:56.194 --> 22:57.194
LINDA: I agree.

22:57.228 --> 23:00.464
Why are you so defensive, Lucifer?

23:00.532 --> 23:02.132
Good question.

23:02.200 --> 23:04.535
Et tu, Doctor?

23:04.602 --> 23:06.703
Lucifer, you asked me
to analyze the situation.

23:06.771 --> 23:09.473
No, I asked you to help
figure out what's wrong with her.

23:10.475 --> 23:11.742
Did you now?

23:11.809 --> 23:12.809
But...

23:12.844 --> 23:14.678
LINDA: Nothing's wrong with her.

23:14.746 --> 23:17.114
She's a woman balancing
a lot on her plate,

23:17.182 --> 23:20.284
and, as far as I can
tell, doing a fantastic job.

23:20.351 --> 23:21.885
Why, thank you.

23:21.953 --> 23:24.154
You're right, Lucifer, she's amazing.

23:24.222 --> 23:25.355
No, she's verbal Ebola.

23:25.423 --> 23:26.990
Where's the button to put the glass up?

23:27.058 --> 23:29.293
(scoffs) This isn't a limo, Lucifer.

23:29.360 --> 23:30.360
And, Dr. Linda,

23:30.395 --> 23:32.296
you should really join us more often.

23:32.363 --> 23:33.697
(scoffs, sighs)

23:33.765 --> 23:36.300
Getting double-teamed is usually
much more fun than this.

23:36.367 --> 23:37.668
Mm.

23:37.735 --> 23:38.802
Gross.

23:41.573 --> 23:42.773
So you lied to us.

23:42.840 --> 23:44.541
You were in town the
day your husband died.

23:44.609 --> 23:47.244
Yes. But it's not what you think.

23:47.312 --> 23:48.845
Okay, then help me understand.

23:48.913 --> 23:51.448
Sandy, I'm on your side.

23:51.516 --> 23:53.083
Not everything stems from jealousy,

23:53.151 --> 23:54.750
no matter what these women tell you.

23:54.775 --> 23:55.509
Hey, Lucifer...

23:55.553 --> 23:58.622
You came here driven by some
kind of desire, didn't you?

23:58.690 --> 23:59.823
No.

23:59.891 --> 24:00.657
Come on.

24:00.725 --> 24:02.859
You can tell me. What was it?

24:04.429 --> 24:05.896
It's disgusting.

24:05.964 --> 24:07.431
Ooh, you naughty girl.

24:07.498 --> 24:09.266
Come on, now you have to tell me.

24:09.334 --> 24:12.736
It's... in my car.

24:12.804 --> 24:13.804
(door lock chirps)

24:13.805 --> 24:16.006
What is, Sandy?

24:16.074 --> 24:16.840
Poop.

24:16.908 --> 24:18.842
Oh.

24:18.910 --> 24:20.344
Bags and bags of it.

24:20.411 --> 24:22.579
Oh, my God.

24:26.084 --> 24:28.485
I'm not sure whether to
be horrified or impressed.

24:28.553 --> 24:30.120
My friend owns a horse.

24:30.188 --> 24:33.190
That's oddly comforting to know.

24:33.258 --> 24:35.125
What were you gonna do with it?

24:35.193 --> 24:37.027
I was going to throw it at Tiffany.

24:37.095 --> 24:37.961
That's the patient

24:38.029 --> 24:41.164
you were accused of... Stalking.

24:41.232 --> 24:42.666
Yeah.

24:42.734 --> 24:44.601
She's in a group
therapy session right now

24:44.669 --> 24:46.103
for my husband's clients.

24:46.170 --> 24:47.237
Group cheater therapy.

24:47.305 --> 24:49.106
Oh, the imagination runs wild.

24:49.173 --> 24:50.707
So Tiffany was sleeping
with your husband.

24:50.775 --> 24:51.842
She was.

24:51.909 --> 24:53.076
How'd you find out?

24:53.144 --> 24:55.812
My husband's
colleague, Dr. Medina, called me.

24:55.880 --> 24:57.948
Okay, so he told you that
your husband was cheating?

24:58.016 --> 24:59.783
No, he had no idea.

24:59.851 --> 25:00.851
He just called to see

25:00.918 --> 25:03.020
if Bernie wanted to
grab a last-minute drink.

25:03.087 --> 25:05.856
But Bernie was supposed to
already be with Dr. Medina.

25:05.923 --> 25:08.158
That's when I knew my
husband lied to me.

25:08.226 --> 25:09.726
But he was the cheater therapist.

25:09.794 --> 25:11.428
I don't quite see the problem here.

25:11.496 --> 25:12.629
(chuckles) I mean, you said yourself...

25:12.697 --> 25:14.631
The problem is he fell in love with her.

25:17.335 --> 25:19.102
I lied to him about my trip,

25:19.170 --> 25:23.273
then I drove back from
Phoenix to see what he was doing.

25:23.341 --> 25:24.408
I was...

25:24.475 --> 25:25.642
Don't say it.

25:25.710 --> 25:26.343
Jealous.

25:26.411 --> 25:27.711
Yes, yes, we all get it!

25:27.779 --> 25:29.112
Jealousy makes the world go...

25:29.180 --> 25:30.914
I mean, what are you, a girl band?

25:30.982 --> 25:32.082
I loved him.

25:32.150 --> 25:33.150
Oh...

25:33.151 --> 25:34.318
(crying) I didn't kill him.

25:34.385 --> 25:36.520
I just wanted him back.

25:38.022 --> 25:39.423
Oh, great.

25:39.490 --> 25:42.220
- The douche-mobile.
- Give me a second.

25:44.729 --> 25:46.396
Hey, I got your text. You okay?

25:46.464 --> 25:47.798
Did Malcolm hurt you?

25:47.865 --> 25:49.533
No. I told you, it's-it's fine.

25:49.600 --> 25:52.302
Everything's fine.

25:52.370 --> 25:55.038
I'm gonna punch that son of a
bitch right back into a coma.

25:55.106 --> 25:56.106
Oh, come on.

25:56.140 --> 25:58.041
No. No.

25:58.109 --> 25:59.476
Anything back on the 999 key?

25:59.544 --> 26:01.678
I'm sorry, Chloe.

26:01.746 --> 26:03.847
They couldn't get any prints off of it.

26:05.883 --> 26:07.751
Thanks.

26:07.819 --> 26:09.753
DR. LINDA: So that's Dan, huh?

26:09.821 --> 26:10.854
Yes.

26:10.922 --> 26:13.824
Numbingly average, isn't he?

26:13.891 --> 26:15.258
I wouldn't say that.

26:15.326 --> 26:18.662
What... You're supposed
to be on my side, you know.

26:18.730 --> 26:21.965
No. I'm supposed to help
you process your emotions

26:22.033 --> 26:23.900
so you can deal with
them constructively.

26:23.968 --> 26:27.838
Yes, by being on my side and
realizing that I'm right.

26:27.905 --> 26:29.139
Lucifer...

26:29.207 --> 26:31.641
Is over this conversation.

26:31.709 --> 26:33.009
I'm gonna go and talk

26:33.077 --> 26:37.481
to some people who are a
little more open-minded, Doctor.

26:43.788 --> 26:46.857
Hi. I'm Dr. Medina.
Thank you for coming.

26:46.924 --> 26:48.792
All right, looks like we have everyone,

26:48.860 --> 26:50.093
so let's start.

26:50.161 --> 26:51.328
Yes! That's a great idea.

26:51.396 --> 26:52.796
There's so very much to discuss.

26:52.864 --> 26:55.932
So let's start with the
most important thing, shall we?

26:56.000 --> 26:58.283
Me.

27:09.870 --> 27:12.005
And once again,

27:12.072 --> 27:14.107
Lucifer disappears.

27:14.174 --> 27:17.777
I think the case may have
hit a little too close to home.

27:17.845 --> 27:18.912
Maybe things got a little too boring

27:18.979 --> 27:20.680
for Mr. Short Attention Span.

27:20.748 --> 27:21.981
I don't know.

27:22.049 --> 27:24.083
He's grown quite a bit
since working with you.

27:24.151 --> 27:26.719
I'm not sure I'm the reason.

27:26.787 --> 27:28.388
I think you've really helped him.

27:28.455 --> 27:30.690
I underestimated you before. I'm sorry.

27:30.758 --> 27:32.625
Not needed. But thank you.

27:32.693 --> 27:34.193
(chuckles) And I thought...

27:34.261 --> 27:35.895
I thought you were sleeping with him.

27:35.963 --> 27:37.463
Oh, I am.

27:37.531 --> 27:39.165
Oh. Oh.

27:40.734 --> 27:42.168
Is, um... is that...?

27:42.236 --> 27:42.835
Ethical?

27:42.903 --> 27:44.437
- Mm-hmm.
- No.

27:44.505 --> 27:46.706
No, it is not.

27:46.774 --> 27:47.941
(sighs)

27:48.008 --> 27:50.510
But there's something about him.

27:50.578 --> 27:52.378
I can't stop myself.

27:52.446 --> 27:53.646
(chuckles)

27:53.714 --> 27:55.515
(sighs)

27:55.583 --> 27:57.216
But I think it's time I did.

27:58.786 --> 28:01.187
I mean, even I'm starting to feel...

28:04.592 --> 28:07.093
So do you think she did it?

28:07.161 --> 28:10.763
CHLOE: Sandy claims she was sitting
outside Tiffany's house,

28:10.831 --> 28:12.699
waiting for Dr. Shaw to show up.

28:12.766 --> 28:15.134
Problem is, no one
can corroborate her alibi.

28:15.202 --> 28:17.403
But, no, I don't think it was her.

28:17.471 --> 28:20.773
So there's no one in Dr.
Shaw's files that looked like

28:20.841 --> 28:22.041
a potential suspect?

28:22.109 --> 28:24.243
Not that I can tell, but
maybe I missed something.

28:24.311 --> 28:25.645
What?

28:25.713 --> 28:28.381
The cheater therapist turned out
to be terrible at cheating.

28:28.449 --> 28:31.718
Why didn't he tell Dr. Medina
he was using him as a cover story?

28:31.785 --> 28:33.019
Maybe he did.

28:33.087 --> 28:35.021
Maybe he confided in Dr. Medina.

28:35.089 --> 28:36.756
But Mrs. Shaw said that Dr. Medina

28:36.824 --> 28:38.591
had no idea about the affair.

28:38.659 --> 28:39.859
Yeah, so he conveniently told her

28:39.927 --> 28:41.767
everything she needed
to know to figure it out.

28:42.863 --> 28:44.230
We need to talk to Dr. Medina.

28:44.298 --> 28:46.799
<i>LUCIFER: Which brings us to today,</i>

28:46.867 --> 28:49.202
where we find Mrs. Shaw

28:49.269 --> 28:51.237
with a bag of excrement in her boot.

28:51.305 --> 28:52.438
Sorry, trunk.

28:52.506 --> 28:54.440
And somehow, out of all that,

28:54.508 --> 28:56.809
they've decided that I'm jealous.

28:57.578 --> 28:59.813
So... what do you think?

28:59.880 --> 29:00.880
Huh?

29:00.915 --> 29:01.715
Yes.

29:01.782 --> 29:03.083
So, wait, you're the Devil?

29:03.150 --> 29:04.284
Yes, yes.

29:04.352 --> 29:06.119
Please keep up. Anyone. You.

29:06.187 --> 29:08.121
When you say you, uh, burned your wings,

29:08.189 --> 29:09.189
was that a metaphor...?

29:09.223 --> 29:11.024
Not focusing on the right details!

29:11.092 --> 29:12.759
Uh, yeah.

29:12.827 --> 29:14.094
She was gonna throw poop at me?

29:14.161 --> 29:15.795
God, this isn't about you, Tiffany.

29:15.863 --> 29:16.930
(laughs) All right?

29:16.997 --> 29:18.998
Huh, no wonder you're all in therapy.

29:19.066 --> 29:22.268
All right, this is supposed
to be a grief therapy session

29:22.336 --> 29:23.603
for the patients of Dr. Shaw.

29:23.671 --> 29:27.107
And everyone here has a
terrible loss to deal with.

29:27.174 --> 29:28.241
What, and I don't?

29:28.309 --> 29:30.410
I've lost both my
therapist and my partner.

29:30.478 --> 29:32.178
I'm s...

29:32.246 --> 29:33.246
Th-They died?

29:33.280 --> 29:34.514
No. No, they turned on me.

29:34.582 --> 29:35.615
Some would argue that's worse.

29:35.683 --> 29:36.850
All right, you need to leave.

29:36.917 --> 29:39.452
No, I'm close to
something. I can feel it.

29:39.520 --> 29:41.187
This is not about you!

29:41.255 --> 29:42.722
(groans) Gah.

29:44.125 --> 29:45.125
You're right.

29:45.126 --> 29:46.359
Yes.

29:46.427 --> 29:48.361
I should use one of you as a case study.

29:48.429 --> 29:49.529
Thank you for volunteering.

29:49.597 --> 29:51.598
So what...

29:51.665 --> 29:54.134
what makes you jealous? Hmm?

29:54.201 --> 29:58.071
What do you desire that you can't have?

29:58.139 --> 29:59.139
Come on.

30:00.207 --> 30:01.341
I...

30:01.409 --> 30:02.475
Yeah?

30:02.543 --> 30:04.644
I want Sandy.

30:06.213 --> 30:07.947
What?

30:08.015 --> 30:10.083
Oh.

30:10.151 --> 30:12.552
I remember you now.

30:12.620 --> 30:15.121
Tissue Lad!

30:15.189 --> 30:18.291
Wanted some open relationship therapy
of your own, is that it?

30:18.359 --> 30:19.826
That's not what it is like.

30:19.894 --> 30:21.561
But she didn't want you, did she?

30:21.629 --> 30:23.496
Sandy loved her husband,

30:23.564 --> 30:26.332
so you killed him, didn't you?

30:26.400 --> 30:27.233
Shut up!

30:27.301 --> 30:28.334
(gasps) Solved it, haven't I?

30:28.402 --> 30:30.069
Eh?! Haven't I?

30:30.137 --> 30:31.504
(patients clamoring)

30:31.572 --> 30:32.572
So that's a yes.

30:32.573 --> 30:33.940
MAN: He's got a knife!

30:34.008 --> 30:36.276
Do you realize what you've done?

30:36.343 --> 30:38.077
I had to kill him, all right?

30:38.145 --> 30:40.380
He lied to her. He cheated on her.

30:40.448 --> 30:43.416
And I tried to tip her
off, but no matter what he did,

30:43.484 --> 30:44.517
she still loved him.

30:44.585 --> 30:45.652
No, no, not that.

30:45.719 --> 30:47.153
This. Right here.

30:47.221 --> 30:50.657
You've just given me the
perfect example of unbridled jealousy.

30:50.724 --> 30:52.992
I'm not jealous. I'm not.

30:53.060 --> 30:55.662
The woman that you
loved was with someone else,

30:55.729 --> 30:57.897
someone you thought
wasn't worthy of her.

30:57.965 --> 31:01.000
But no matter what you did...

31:01.068 --> 31:03.603
she never saw you the
way you wanted her to.

31:03.671 --> 31:06.272
That's...

31:06.340 --> 31:07.874
That's pretty accurate.

31:07.942 --> 31:09.609
Yeah.

31:09.677 --> 31:11.544
You've just made me realize something.

31:12.813 --> 31:16.349
That my situation and yours are...

31:16.417 --> 31:18.852
absolutely nothing alike.

31:18.919 --> 31:20.720
I was right! Not jealous!

31:20.788 --> 31:22.355
CHLOE: Drop your weapon!

31:22.423 --> 31:24.491
(both grunting)

31:25.259 --> 31:26.960
- Ow!
- Ooh.

31:29.930 --> 31:31.097
(grunts)

31:31.165 --> 31:32.465
Did you seriously

31:32.533 --> 31:34.067
just bite me?

31:34.134 --> 31:35.368
(sighs)

31:35.436 --> 31:36.603
He's the killer.

31:36.670 --> 31:38.004
(panting)

31:38.072 --> 31:40.373
Yeah, you think?

31:40.441 --> 31:41.908
(indistinct police radio chatter)

31:51.018 --> 31:52.018
(engine starts)

32:00.794 --> 32:02.328
So you were right about Linda.

32:02.396 --> 32:03.863
She helped me figure out the motive.

32:03.931 --> 32:07.600
And then I realized
Jonathan and Dr. Shaw's offices

32:07.668 --> 32:09.335
shared the same security system.

32:09.403 --> 32:10.537
So I checked and...

32:10.604 --> 32:12.939
You're not listening to me, are you?

32:15.042 --> 32:17.477
Afraid not.

32:18.579 --> 32:19.746
You didn't see any similarity

32:19.813 --> 32:21.548
between yourself and Jonathan?

32:21.615 --> 32:24.317
So you heard some of that, did you?

32:24.385 --> 32:25.985
Tail end.

32:26.053 --> 32:29.222
(sighs)

32:29.290 --> 32:31.357
I don't know.

32:31.425 --> 32:32.592
Did you?

32:33.494 --> 32:36.262
Mm-mm. No.

32:36.330 --> 32:37.764
Completely different.

32:37.831 --> 32:40.800
That's what I thought.

32:40.868 --> 32:42.001
(chuckles)

32:42.069 --> 32:45.939
So... how's your secret
case with Dan going?

32:46.006 --> 32:47.206
Secretly terrible.

32:47.274 --> 32:48.508
Do you remember Malcolm?

32:49.410 --> 32:50.543
Coma boy?

32:51.445 --> 32:52.579
He woke up.

32:52.646 --> 32:54.047
He claims he's innocent.

32:55.849 --> 32:58.585
Something he said bothers me.

32:58.652 --> 33:00.153
Whoever shot him knew about Palmetto,

33:00.220 --> 33:02.655
but he says that no one should
have known he was there.

33:02.723 --> 33:04.824
Well, you found him there.

33:04.892 --> 33:07.160
Yeah, I... He pointed that out, too.

33:07.227 --> 33:09.896
So, whoever followed him could
have done what I did.

33:09.964 --> 33:11.698
So how did you track him?

33:11.765 --> 33:14.167
Partners on the force share
GPS locators in their gear

33:14.234 --> 33:16.436
so that they can find
each other in emergencies.

33:16.503 --> 33:19.639
You hacked his partner's locator.

33:19.707 --> 33:21.708
Which means...

33:21.775 --> 33:24.243
Malcolm's partner
knew he was there, too.

33:26.180 --> 33:27.814
Tony Paolucci knew.

33:41.562 --> 33:43.663
♪ ♪

33:46.333 --> 33:48.034
(knocking)

33:48.102 --> 33:51.170
That's Paolucci's car,
just like his GPS said.

33:51.238 --> 33:52.338
But the bar's closed.

33:52.406 --> 33:55.541
Maybe he decided to
keep the party going.

33:57.444 --> 33:58.945
(door creaks)

34:00.414 --> 34:02.181
(chuckles)

34:03.584 --> 34:05.385
You have to stop doing that.

34:05.452 --> 34:07.120
It was unlocked.

34:09.356 --> 34:12.091
♪ ♪

34:17.563 --> 34:19.866
Paolucci, you in here?

34:25.005 --> 34:27.674
♪ ♪

34:47.795 --> 34:50.129
At least you can see
what he was thinking.

34:50.197 --> 34:51.898
(scoffs)

35:04.278 --> 35:06.146
Dan.

35:09.850 --> 35:10.917
(sighs)

35:10.985 --> 35:12.952
I found a suicide note.

35:13.854 --> 35:15.155
In his handwriting?

35:16.023 --> 35:17.390
Sure looks like it.

35:17.458 --> 35:19.359
Apparently, he was on the take.

35:19.426 --> 35:21.795
Malcolm was onto
him, so Paolucci shot him.

35:21.862 --> 35:23.196
When Malcolm woke up,

35:23.264 --> 35:25.165
Paolucci couldn't
take the guilt anymore.

35:31.739 --> 35:33.106
You okay?

35:33.974 --> 35:35.275
Paolucci was an ass,

35:35.342 --> 35:38.578
but this... I can't imagine this.

35:38.646 --> 35:40.446
I know.

35:40.514 --> 35:42.248
I know.

35:59.133 --> 36:00.200
(knocking)

36:00.267 --> 36:02.669
Uh, come in.

36:02.736 --> 36:04.304
Hello, Doctor.

36:06.173 --> 36:07.473
(sighs)

36:07.541 --> 36:08.842
Thank you for coming.

36:08.909 --> 36:12.612
Uh, I know we're not due for
a session for a few days.

36:12.680 --> 36:14.080
No, my bad.

36:14.148 --> 36:16.816
I realize I'm not up to date
on my payments, so... (chuckles)

36:18.185 --> 36:19.853
Uh...

36:19.920 --> 36:20.954
don't.

36:23.390 --> 36:25.191
What's wrong? Nothing's wrong.

36:25.259 --> 36:27.093
I realized a few things.

36:27.161 --> 36:29.796
As I said,

36:29.864 --> 36:33.299
we made a breakthrough.

36:33.367 --> 36:37.637
And I think, with that in mind,

36:37.705 --> 36:40.106
we should keep our
relationship professional from now on.

36:40.174 --> 36:41.241
Oh.

36:41.308 --> 36:42.375
Are you sure?

36:42.443 --> 36:44.410
Very much so.

36:45.880 --> 36:47.113
Very well.

36:47.181 --> 36:49.749
If, uh... if you think it's best.

36:49.817 --> 36:50.817
I do.

36:50.818 --> 36:52.151
Right.

36:52.219 --> 36:56.589
Well, I'll, um... see
you at my next session, then.

37:02.897 --> 37:03.897
(door closes)

37:03.964 --> 37:04.964
(sighs)

37:04.965 --> 37:05.965
(door opens)

37:05.966 --> 37:07.834
- One last thing before I go.
- Yes?

37:07.902 --> 37:10.770
Dr. Canaan down the
hall... what's he like?

37:11.839 --> 37:13.940
Uh, thoughtful.

37:14.008 --> 37:16.042
Spiritual. Why?

37:16.110 --> 37:17.944
Little sanctimonious?

37:18.012 --> 37:19.746
I don't know. I suppose.

37:19.813 --> 37:22.348
Six-foot-two,
black, voice like an angel?

37:22.416 --> 37:23.750
Oh, you know him.

37:23.817 --> 37:26.219
(sighing)

37:26.287 --> 37:28.554
All too well.

37:32.960 --> 37:34.294
Trixie's finally down.

37:34.361 --> 37:36.596
(chuckles) She conned
you into reading the book

37:36.664 --> 37:38.798
about the sneezing panda, didn't she?

37:38.866 --> 37:40.500
Five times.

37:40.567 --> 37:42.168
(chuckling)

37:46.173 --> 37:48.808
Hey. Um... (sighs)

37:48.876 --> 37:50.576
thank you.

37:51.812 --> 37:52.879
For what?

37:52.947 --> 37:57.283
You know, for having my back and...

37:57.351 --> 37:58.651
for everything.

38:06.994 --> 38:08.594
You're welcome.

38:10.064 --> 38:11.264
For everything.

38:25.179 --> 38:27.480
You should go.

38:28.983 --> 38:30.350
Yeah, I should.

38:30.417 --> 38:32.485
I'm sorry.

38:32.553 --> 38:35.355
No. Don't be sorry.

38:36.790 --> 38:39.225
(sighs)

38:41.795 --> 38:43.229
(phone buzzing)

38:44.698 --> 38:46.632
(groaning sigh)

38:51.238 --> 38:53.373
(sighs)

38:57.978 --> 39:00.913
(sighs)

39:00.981 --> 39:02.849
All right. (chuckles)

39:02.916 --> 39:04.617
Okay.

39:04.685 --> 39:05.918
Bye.

39:25.506 --> 39:27.640
MALCOLM: Evening, Dan.

39:29.877 --> 39:31.811
I got your text.

39:31.879 --> 39:33.679
What do you want?

39:34.782 --> 39:35.982
(sighs)

39:36.050 --> 39:38.851
Just wanted to congratulate
you on closing Palmetto.

39:38.919 --> 39:41.521
You and that smart, sexy lady of yours

39:41.588 --> 39:43.489
caught the guy who shot me.

39:46.293 --> 39:48.828
That's what the confession said, right?

39:49.897 --> 39:53.399
How long did it take you to write it?

39:53.467 --> 39:54.734
(laughing)

39:54.802 --> 39:57.170
Forever. I mean, I'm so not a word guy.

39:57.237 --> 39:59.439
(laughing) You know?

39:59.506 --> 40:02.175
What? You should be thanking me.

40:02.242 --> 40:03.876
Why is that?

40:03.944 --> 40:07.280
Well, I could have
told everyone the truth...

40:07.347 --> 40:09.682
that you shot me.

40:10.551 --> 40:11.884
Why didn't you?

40:19.193 --> 40:20.694
'Cause I like you.

40:20.761 --> 40:24.598
And I can't imagine what
would happen to your life

40:24.665 --> 40:27.100
if people found out the truth.

40:27.168 --> 40:28.768
Your colleagues, your ex...

40:28.836 --> 40:31.438
I swear to God, I
will... What? Shoot me?

40:31.505 --> 40:33.273
Ah, been there, done that.

40:33.341 --> 40:35.308
Big fail. (laughs)

40:35.376 --> 40:38.244
Besides, you wouldn't want anything

40:38.312 --> 40:40.013
to mess with your pretty little family

40:40.081 --> 40:42.515
now that you're
working to fix things, right?

40:43.517 --> 40:45.151
Whatever you want to do to me,

40:45.219 --> 40:46.820
- you keep them out of it.
- Dan.

40:48.222 --> 40:50.023
Come on.

40:50.091 --> 40:51.791
I'm not gonna hurt anyone.

40:52.860 --> 40:54.327
No.

40:54.395 --> 40:56.129
No, no, no, no, no.

40:56.197 --> 40:58.531
You... you and I...

40:59.600 --> 41:01.534
we're gonna be best friends.

41:01.602 --> 41:02.869
Yeah.

41:02.937 --> 41:05.572
Because I got big plans for you.

41:05.640 --> 41:07.140
Big plans.

41:07.208 --> 41:09.376
(laughing)

41:09.443 --> 41:11.411
Fun, right?

41:11.479 --> 41:13.680
We're having fun now.

found Dr. Linda.

41:55.223 --> 41:58.458
He was an angel on her
shoulder, trying to control me.

41:58.526 --> 42:01.061
I wonder how my dear, angelic brother

42:01.128 --> 42:03.663
got such a wickedly clever idea.

42:06.100 --> 42:07.767
I did it to protect you.

I told you,

You did it for yourself.
