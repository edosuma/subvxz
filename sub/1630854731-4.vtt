WEBVTT

00:02.698 --> 00:03.873
Thanks for giving up
your weekend

00:03.873 --> 00:05.353
to straighten out
the books.

00:05.353 --> 00:07.007
It's big of you
to step up like that.

00:07.007 --> 00:08.182
Yeah, sure.

00:08.182 --> 00:09.661
By the way, I am--

00:09.661 --> 00:11.576
I am getting paid overtime
for this, right?

00:11.576 --> 00:14.536
Oh, Sid, you always know
how to put a smile on my face.

00:14.536 --> 00:15.972
No, I'm being serious.

00:15.972 --> 00:17.930
Otherwise, this would be
a major labor violation.

00:17.930 --> 00:21.804
Oh, Sid, you're too much!

00:21.804 --> 00:24.633
My sides are hurting
from laughing too hard.

00:24.633 --> 00:26.287
Hm?

00:26.287 --> 00:28.898
Oh, sorry about that.
I've got my son for the week.

00:28.898 --> 00:31.031
I didn't even know
you had a son.

00:31.031 --> 00:32.815
Yeah. Timmy!

00:32.815 --> 00:34.817
What?

00:34.817 --> 00:37.341
Ow! Quit hitting myself!

00:37.341 --> 00:39.735
Ow! I'm not hitting myself.
I am.

00:39.735 --> 00:43.913
Oh, so Timmy is, um,
how do I say this?

00:43.913 --> 00:46.176
A radioactive freak?
Yes.

00:46.176 --> 00:47.873
He's from
my first marriage.

00:47.873 --> 00:50.354
You could say it was
a "toxic" relationship.

00:51.747 --> 00:53.923
But seriously, it was
an abusive dynamic.

00:53.923 --> 00:56.447
The psychic wounds
from which I'm still recovering.

00:56.447 --> 00:58.101
Oh, I'm sorry
to hear that.

00:58.101 --> 01:01.452
Now, Timmy, Sid and I
are working.

01:01.452 --> 01:04.281
Your pops happens to be
a pretty important business man.

01:04.281 --> 01:06.805
Well, I think you're a phony,
and I hate you.

01:06.805 --> 01:10.200
Yeah!
Suck deez nuts, old man!

01:11.593 --> 01:13.595
It's just a game we play.

01:13.595 --> 01:16.032
No, I will not
"suck deez nuts", son.

01:18.774 --> 01:21.081
We have fun.

01:32.222 --> 01:33.789
Good morning,
Mr. Rubinstein.

01:33.789 --> 01:35.617
The wreckage from this week's
death race has come in.

01:35.617 --> 01:37.184
Do you want me to start off
by washing off the brains

01:37.184 --> 01:38.489
or picking out
the little bits of bones

01:38.489 --> 01:40.535
from underneath the seats?

01:40.535 --> 01:41.536
Either is fine.

01:42.624 --> 01:43.712
What's wrong?

01:43.712 --> 01:45.105
I'm worried about Timmy.

01:45.105 --> 01:46.584
It's his Grouping Ceremony
next week.

01:46.584 --> 01:48.891
When you get placed
in one of the five groups--

01:48.891 --> 01:51.894
Strong, Heroic, Kind,
Wise, or Malicious.

01:51.894 --> 01:54.549
Wait, those are the only
five groups a person can be in?

01:54.549 --> 01:57.465
What if you're something else,
like funny or well-organized?

01:57.465 --> 01:59.206
Nope, just the five.

01:59.206 --> 02:01.469
I'm sorry, did you say one of
the groups was called Malicious?

02:01.469 --> 02:03.035
Like evil?

02:03.035 --> 02:04.211
That seems like something
you wouldn't

02:04.211 --> 02:05.212
want to actively encourage.

02:05.212 --> 02:07.039
Enough with the questions.

02:07.039 --> 02:08.737
You probably don't get it

02:08.737 --> 02:10.173
because you're an animal-person
from the Wasteland.

02:10.173 --> 02:11.653
Oh, yeah, good point.

02:11.653 --> 02:12.828
I always dreamed that Timmy
would get into

02:12.828 --> 02:14.830
Strong, like his old man.

02:16.962 --> 02:18.355
You wouldn't know it now,
but, uh,

02:18.355 --> 02:20.662
I was quite
the beefcake in my day.

02:20.662 --> 02:22.881
Wow.
That is a disturbing image.

02:22.881 --> 02:25.406
Oh, I was ripping phone books
in half,

02:25.406 --> 02:26.842
grabbing nerds
by the ankle,

02:26.842 --> 02:30.193
and swinging them
into outer space.

02:30.193 --> 02:32.587
I don't know if Timmy
has the right stuff.

02:32.587 --> 02:34.980
Well, hope it all works out
for the best.

02:34.980 --> 02:37.983
Um, have you seen
my junkyard keys?

02:37.983 --> 02:39.637
Ah, there they are.

02:43.772 --> 02:48.298
Say, you're a strong guy.

02:48.298 --> 02:50.039
Think you could
tutor Timmy?

02:50.039 --> 02:51.867
Maybe give him
a pointer or two?

02:51.867 --> 02:53.347
I mean, suppose
I could, but, I mean,

02:53.347 --> 02:54.957
this work is gonna
take me all day.

02:54.957 --> 02:56.698
No, that's fine.
You can just get them both done

02:56.698 --> 02:57.960
in the same
amount of time.

02:57.960 --> 03:00.354
Yeah, great.
Why didn't I think of that?

03:00.354 --> 03:03.270
Yeah.

03:03.270 --> 03:04.749
♪ You're not a dog,
you're a man ♪

03:04.749 --> 03:06.621
♪ You've been brainwashed
by your captors ♪

03:06.621 --> 03:09.624
♪ You should kill them
and return to your old life ♪

03:09.624 --> 03:11.800
Man, where have I heard
that song before?

03:11.800 --> 03:14.716
It's been stuck
in my head for years.

03:14.716 --> 03:15.847
Oh, hi.

03:15.847 --> 03:17.501
I need coffee.

03:19.286 --> 03:20.722
Oh.

03:20.722 --> 03:22.202
Oh.

03:24.291 --> 03:25.814
Looks like someone
had a big night.

03:27.424 --> 03:29.165
Tai and I went to one of those
heavy metal concerts

03:29.165 --> 03:30.906
in the middle
of the Wasteland.

03:30.906 --> 03:32.908
I think at one point,
I may have gotten up on stage

03:32.908 --> 03:35.040
and battled
a flame-throwing guitarist?

03:35.040 --> 03:36.738
Am I, like,
melted anywhere?

03:36.738 --> 03:38.305
Well, not to brag,

03:38.305 --> 03:40.220
but Sid and I had
a pretty wild night ourselves.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.786
We cooked
a sensible dinner,

03:41.786 --> 03:43.266
than played some cards
by the fire.

03:43.266 --> 03:45.312
But let's just say we didn't
get much playing done,

03:45.312 --> 03:47.314
because we were asleep
by 9:00, baby!

03:47.314 --> 03:49.533
Ugh.
That is so lame.

03:49.533 --> 03:51.927
If you ever see me staying in
on a weekend,

03:51.927 --> 03:53.755
do me a favor
and kill me.

03:56.584 --> 03:58.020
Aah!
What?

03:58.020 --> 03:59.761
Wait, what's wrong?[ Groans ] I don't know.

03:59.761 --> 04:02.764
Ah, it feels like my skull
is being ripped apart!

04:02.764 --> 04:04.026
Go get help, boy!

04:04.026 --> 04:05.723
Yeah, no, I'm--
I'm on it.

04:05.723 --> 04:08.639
I just need-- need to finish
my breakfast first.

04:08.639 --> 04:10.250
Ooh.

04:10.250 --> 04:12.121
Oh, man, that's good.

04:12.121 --> 04:14.602
"In the Wasteland, you happen
upon a gang of marauders

04:14.602 --> 04:16.256
robbing an innocent man.

04:16.256 --> 04:19.955
Do you-- A-- risk life and
limb to save the innocent man?

04:19.955 --> 04:22.566
B-- befriend the marauders?

04:22.566 --> 04:26.353
C-- bash the marauders
with your huge muscles?

04:26.353 --> 04:29.834
Or-- D-- kill everyone,
innocent man included,

04:29.834 --> 04:31.706
and dance in their blood?"

04:31.706 --> 04:33.185
Jesus.

04:33.185 --> 04:34.709
Well, I guess we know
which one Malicious is.

04:36.450 --> 04:38.495
This is a waste of time.

04:38.495 --> 04:40.105
I'm never getting into Strong.

04:40.105 --> 04:41.716
Oh, hey, hey, hey.

04:41.716 --> 04:45.285
Don't say that, even if
that instinct is likely correct.

04:45.285 --> 04:46.808
Let's just--
We'll tally up your score,

04:46.808 --> 04:48.462
and we'll see where we are.

04:51.595 --> 04:52.814
Oh, my God.

04:52.814 --> 04:54.511
Timmy is heroic.

04:54.511 --> 04:57.732
He chose the Heroic response
to every single question.

04:57.732 --> 05:00.517
My son is Heroic?

05:01.997 --> 05:03.520
That's terrible news!

05:03.520 --> 05:05.435
What? That's not the reaction
I was expecting.

05:05.435 --> 05:07.655
Well, what's he gonna do
as a hero?

05:07.655 --> 05:09.918
Help a little old lady
across the street?

05:09.918 --> 05:12.660
Stop a terrorist attack?
Where's the money in that?

05:12.660 --> 05:14.096
Uh, okay, I mean,
if you're looking at it

05:14.096 --> 05:15.837
from a strictly
money-making angle--

05:15.837 --> 05:18.187
No, it has to be Strong.

05:18.187 --> 05:20.711
It was best for me,
and it's best for Timmy.

05:20.711 --> 05:22.626
Look, I hear you,
but what do you want to do?

05:22.626 --> 05:25.629
I mean, Timmy just doesn't have
the qualifications.

05:25.629 --> 05:28.066
Maybe not in
the traditional sense,

05:28.066 --> 05:30.286
but old Morris
has his ways.

05:30.286 --> 05:31.287
You mean cheating?

05:31.287 --> 05:33.289
Bingo, baby.

05:37.554 --> 05:39.600
Oh, that's the stuff, baby!

05:39.600 --> 05:42.298
Ooh! Who's my next victim--

05:42.298 --> 05:44.909
I mean, patient, patient.

05:44.909 --> 05:46.346
Hi.
Hi.

05:46.346 --> 05:47.782
Thanks for seeing me
on such short notice,

05:47.782 --> 05:49.349
Dr. Crazybrainz.

05:49.349 --> 05:50.828
I heard you were the best
doctor in Boomtown.

05:50.828 --> 05:53.396
Actually, I'm the <i>only</i>
doctor in Boomtown.

05:53.396 --> 05:56.747
Because all the other doctors
were my patients.

05:59.228 --> 06:00.795
I can't tell if
you're kidding or not.

06:00.795 --> 06:01.970
Let's take a little
looksy-loo

06:01.970 --> 06:04.059
under the hoodsy-hoo,
shall we?

06:04.059 --> 06:06.844
- Ow.
- Instruments, instruments.

06:06.844 --> 06:10.021
Whoo! All right, cranial sac
looks healthy.

06:10.021 --> 06:12.546
And a nice squishy
spleen.

06:12.546 --> 06:14.765
What do you think
it could be, doc?

06:14.765 --> 06:16.811
Some kind of
deadly super-virus?

06:16.811 --> 06:18.160
Highly advanced nanobots?

06:18.160 --> 06:19.944
God, I hope it's not
a zombie infection.

06:19.944 --> 06:21.990
I'm too young
to eat brains!

06:21.990 --> 06:24.601
You have a hangover.

06:24.601 --> 06:26.908
What?
That's it?

06:26.908 --> 06:29.476
Yeah, just a regular,
run-of-the-mill hangover.

06:29.476 --> 06:31.260
You probably hit it
a little hard last night, right?

06:31.260 --> 06:33.654
No, no, no, no, no.

06:33.654 --> 06:36.744
That can't be right.
I do not get hangovers.

06:36.744 --> 06:39.486
Well, at your age, it's pretty
normal to start getting them.

06:39.486 --> 06:42.576
I recommend eight hours of sleep
and plenty of liquids.

06:42.576 --> 06:44.273
And that'll cure me?

06:44.273 --> 06:46.188
No, you'll be some
combination of tired

06:46.188 --> 06:47.581
and sore for
the rest of your life.

06:47.581 --> 06:50.279
This will make you feel
slightly less bad.

06:51.889 --> 06:53.021
Sorry, one second.

06:53.021 --> 06:54.457
I'll leave you to it.

06:54.457 --> 06:55.893
- Hey, Tai.
- Hey!

06:55.893 --> 06:58.418
Last night was epic, huh?

06:58.418 --> 07:01.246
Oh, I went home with
this super hot droid,

07:01.246 --> 07:02.639
but then this morning
I woke up and realized

07:02.639 --> 07:04.336
he was just
a normal trash can.

07:04.336 --> 07:06.774
The sex was still amazing, though.

07:06.774 --> 07:08.863
<i>So what are you doing tonight?</i>

07:08.863 --> 07:10.386
Tonight?

07:10.386 --> 07:12.040
I don't know.
I was, um--

07:12.040 --> 07:15.260
I was thinking maybe I would
just take a night off.

07:15.260 --> 07:18.002
No, no, no!
You can't tonight.

07:18.002 --> 07:20.265
The Sunpiercer's in town.

07:20.265 --> 07:22.137
It's that high-speed
bullet train carrying

07:22.137 --> 07:25.749
<i>an entire society on an endless
loop around the Earth.</i>

07:25.749 --> 07:27.534
It is supposed to be lit!

07:27.534 --> 07:30.754
Damn, that sounds
really fun.

07:30.754 --> 07:32.669
You know what?
Screw it.

07:32.669 --> 07:34.584
I'm in.

07:34.584 --> 07:37.457
Wait, you can't leave now.
You need to rest.

07:37.457 --> 07:39.415
Thanks for the advice, doc,
but you forgot

07:39.415 --> 07:42.113
one thing about--
I'm not a freakin' loser.

07:42.113 --> 07:43.550
Later, Doctor Dork.

07:43.550 --> 07:44.855
Ow.

07:44.855 --> 07:46.509
Hey!

07:46.509 --> 07:49.294
What?

07:49.294 --> 07:51.732
Why doesn't anyone
ever listen to me?

07:51.732 --> 07:53.908
Oh, well, time to drill a hole
in my brain.

08:02.743 --> 08:05.572
Excuse me? We're look for
The Administrator.

08:05.572 --> 08:07.791
I'm--
Morris Rubinstein.

08:07.791 --> 08:10.054
I've been expecting you.

08:10.054 --> 08:11.708
Wow, how--
how did you know that?

08:11.708 --> 08:14.581
Hm. Well, much like
this bonsai tree,

08:14.581 --> 08:19.194
we've perfected the technology
that sculpts human behavior--

08:19.194 --> 08:22.458
what you might call "fate".

08:22.458 --> 08:23.546
Yeah, something tells me
this woman

08:23.546 --> 08:25.287
is not gonna
help you cheat.

08:25.287 --> 08:27.115
Shh, will you let me
do my thing?

08:27.115 --> 08:29.073
Everyone has their price.

08:29.073 --> 08:32.163
Uh, so, listen, my son,
Timmy, really wants to get into

08:32.163 --> 08:35.210
Strong, but doesn't
really have the grades.

08:35.210 --> 08:37.255
Think you could
help him out for,

08:37.255 --> 08:40.650
oh, I don't know--
1,000 bird beaks?

08:40.650 --> 08:42.391
Mr. Rubinstein,
if you're asking me

08:42.391 --> 08:45.002
to cheat,
the answer is no.

08:45.002 --> 08:47.439
The Grouping Ceremony must
remain pure for the proper

08:47.439 --> 08:49.833
functioning of our society.

08:49.833 --> 08:51.705
Would you do it
for 2,000?

08:51.705 --> 08:53.968
Mr. Rubinstein,
you are embarrassing yourself.

08:53.968 --> 08:55.447
Yes, I agree.

08:55.447 --> 08:57.188
Um, thank you so much,
Ms. Administrator.

08:57.188 --> 08:58.973
Sorry for wasting
your time.

08:58.973 --> 09:01.410
You have a lovely office, by the
way, very sterile and cold.

09:01.410 --> 09:03.673
Come on,
she said no, Morris.

09:03.673 --> 09:05.545
Wait!

09:05.545 --> 09:07.068
10,000.

09:07.068 --> 09:08.460
Did you say 10 G's?

09:08.460 --> 09:10.985
All yours if you can get
Timmy into Strong.

09:12.769 --> 09:14.510
Deal.

09:16.207 --> 09:19.254
Wow, it worked.

09:19.254 --> 09:20.864
You know what, I am just gonna
stop asking questions

09:20.864 --> 09:22.649
at this point
and sort of go with it.

09:25.086 --> 09:26.740
All right, let's go over
this plan one more time.

09:26.740 --> 09:28.132
Oh, did a child
make this?

09:28.132 --> 09:30.091
No, I did,
and it took me all night.

09:30.091 --> 09:33.137
All right, now,
Timmy's test is tomorrow,

09:33.137 --> 09:34.704
but Timmy
won't be there.

09:34.704 --> 09:36.837
You will, passing with
flying colors.

09:36.837 --> 09:38.447
Wait, I'm gonna be Timmy?

09:38.447 --> 09:40.231
Am I not missing
an extra head?

09:40.231 --> 09:41.929
Three steps ahead of you.

09:41.929 --> 09:44.758
I'll be there with you
in an oversized sweater, baby!

09:44.758 --> 09:49.589
Meanwhile, Timmy will take
a fake exam with a fake proctor.

09:49.589 --> 09:52.766
All we have to do is find
someone Timmy won't recognize.

09:52.766 --> 09:56.030
Someone with smarts,
a real professor type.

09:57.771 --> 09:59.207
Who farted?

10:01.296 --> 10:02.906
False alarm.

10:05.953 --> 10:07.998
I think we found our guy.

10:09.913 --> 10:11.611
Did we?

10:15.092 --> 10:18.966
So, the Sunpiercer is divided
by socioeconomic class,

10:18.966 --> 10:21.098
so I say we pregame
here in Poorville

10:21.098 --> 10:22.796
where the drinks
are super cheap,

10:22.796 --> 10:24.798
then make our way over
to first class

10:24.798 --> 10:27.409
where you can teabag
an oil tycoon.

10:27.409 --> 10:29.716
Wow, sounds like
a long night.

10:29.716 --> 10:31.239
When did you say
this party ends?

10:31.239 --> 10:33.676
Never.

10:33.676 --> 10:36.244
The Sunpiercer runs on
a perpetual-motion engine

10:36.244 --> 10:38.681
that never stops, baby!

10:38.681 --> 10:40.335
Just like us, right?

10:40.335 --> 10:42.380
Totally!

10:42.380 --> 10:45.340
Choo-choo!

10:45.340 --> 10:48.343
Whew.
I'm gonna need a pick-me-up.

10:53.304 --> 10:55.611
Yo, yo, yo, what's up,
party people?

10:55.611 --> 10:56.960
What's on
the menu tonight?

10:56.960 --> 10:59.702
We talkin' Zappers?
Freeze? Sludge?

10:59.702 --> 11:02.226
Oh, sorry, we--
we don't do drugs.

11:02.226 --> 11:03.488
Yeah right.
Look at you.

11:03.488 --> 11:05.186
You're all hyped up
and tweaking.

11:05.186 --> 11:08.755
That's because we're young
and full of natural energy!

11:08.755 --> 11:11.279
Oh. Cool, cool.
Me too.

11:11.279 --> 11:13.847
Hey, guys! Let's eat a full
pizza after this.

11:13.847 --> 11:17.241
We can do that because
we have great metabolisms!

11:18.460 --> 11:19.853
Bye.

11:20.984 --> 11:23.508
Timmy Rubinstein.

11:26.773 --> 11:28.992
Here.

11:28.992 --> 11:30.777
I told you we should
have practiced.

11:30.777 --> 11:32.604
And I told you practicing
would ruin

11:32.604 --> 11:34.345
the electricity
of the moment.

11:36.347 --> 11:37.958
- Timmy Rubinstein.
- Timmy Rubin-- oh, right.

11:37.958 --> 11:39.916
Sid, sorry, you say it.

11:39.916 --> 11:42.310
Thank you, Timmy.

11:42.310 --> 11:44.138
Have a seat now, please.

11:44.138 --> 11:46.096
Thank you.

11:47.619 --> 11:48.795
She bought it.

11:48.795 --> 11:51.014
She's in on it!

11:51.014 --> 11:55.366
Hey, enough with the talking.
Eyes up here.

11:55.366 --> 11:57.412
Class is in session.

11:57.412 --> 11:59.544
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

12:04.158 --> 12:07.944
My name is Professor Scraps.

12:07.944 --> 12:12.732
That's--

12:12.732 --> 12:15.256
How do you spell "Pruh"?

12:15.256 --> 12:17.649
"How big are your muscles?"

12:17.649 --> 12:18.738
Huge.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.348
Sid, hey.

12:20.348 --> 12:22.829
I think this little girl
is on to us.

12:22.829 --> 12:24.831
Why do you think that?
She's not even looking at us.

12:24.831 --> 12:26.658
Yeah, because she knows.

12:26.658 --> 12:28.660
I'm cracking
under the pressure, man.

12:28.660 --> 12:29.966
I got to
get out of here!

12:29.966 --> 12:31.576
No.

12:31.576 --> 12:33.709
Wait, no.

12:35.319 --> 12:37.626
Just calm down, okay?
You literally have to sit here

12:37.626 --> 12:40.107
and do nothing
for this plan to work.

12:41.717 --> 12:45.547
Oh, I picked a bad day
to stop wearing underwear.

12:45.547 --> 12:47.114
Why are you not wearing
underwear?

12:47.114 --> 12:49.420
Because we're supposed
to be one person.

12:49.420 --> 12:50.857
If somebody saw two pair
of underwear,

12:50.857 --> 12:52.989
then the whole plan
is blown wide open.

12:52.989 --> 12:54.686
Doy!

12:56.950 --> 12:58.603
Frey-Frey!

13:01.824 --> 13:03.173
- Frey-Frey!
- Ah!

13:03.173 --> 13:04.609
I'm not asleep, you are.

13:04.609 --> 13:05.959
I'm getting kind of tired.

13:05.959 --> 13:07.264
There's not much going on

13:07.264 --> 13:08.657
in this middle-class section
of the train.

13:08.657 --> 13:11.225
It's just kind of normal.

13:11.225 --> 13:13.749
Oh. I mean, well,
I could keep partying forever.

13:13.749 --> 13:16.404
But, I mean, if you're tired,
I suppose we could leave.

13:16.404 --> 13:17.797
Oh, no,
we don't have to go.

13:17.797 --> 13:19.929
I just have to switch
out my battery.

13:24.107 --> 13:26.283
Whoo-hoo!
Back to 100%.

13:26.283 --> 13:27.807
Oh, are you freakin'
kidding me?

13:27.807 --> 13:29.112
Choo-choo, bitch!

13:29.112 --> 13:31.419
Choo-choo.

13:31.419 --> 13:34.814
It's just hard to weigh
the pros and cons.

13:34.814 --> 13:36.685
And private school
can just be so expensive,

13:36.685 --> 13:38.165
but I really liked
the way it looked.

13:38.165 --> 13:39.514
And the teachers were

13:39.514 --> 13:42.169
quite nice
and experienced.

13:42.169 --> 13:46.651
Alfred Ronschtadt,
you are Malicious.

13:49.480 --> 13:50.742
Why are we allowing
this to happen?

13:50.742 --> 13:51.874
They're all just
standing there.

13:51.874 --> 13:53.180
We could arrest them
right now.

13:53.180 --> 13:55.922
Will you shut up?
Timmy's up next.

13:55.922 --> 13:57.445
Oh, this is it.

13:57.445 --> 13:59.316
Nothing we can do now
but expect the outcome

13:59.316 --> 14:01.318
we predetermined
through bribery.

14:01.318 --> 14:03.451
Timmy Rubinstein.

14:03.451 --> 14:06.236
You are Strong.

14:06.236 --> 14:07.368
I am?
I am?

14:07.368 --> 14:09.805
Yes!
He did it!

14:09.805 --> 14:12.286
And you tried to stop me.
In your face!

14:12.286 --> 14:13.678
Are you joking?
I <i>helped</i> you.

14:13.678 --> 14:15.115
Yeah, but you were reluctant.

14:15.115 --> 14:17.291
Now that Strong is complete,

14:17.291 --> 14:20.294
they'll begin their
strength training immediately

14:20.294 --> 14:23.166
by breaking rocks
in the hard labor camp.

14:25.647 --> 14:29.477
Uh, Sid, I hope we didn't
make a huge mistake.

14:33.873 --> 14:36.832
Ah, it's good to be back
in Strong.

14:36.832 --> 14:38.312
Ooh, I like what I'm seeing.

14:38.312 --> 14:39.966
Keep it up.

14:39.966 --> 14:42.969
All right, nice and tight.

14:42.969 --> 14:44.622
Hey, up high.
Too slow.

14:44.622 --> 14:46.668
Bongo, bongo, bongo!

14:48.800 --> 14:50.759
Anyone seen Timmy?

14:50.759 --> 14:53.718
Down here.

14:53.718 --> 14:54.850
What are you doing
under there?

14:54.850 --> 14:56.547
I got stuck
under this rock.

14:56.547 --> 14:58.114
I've been here all day.

14:58.114 --> 15:00.334
Aw, you just need time
to adjust.

15:02.466 --> 15:05.948
Can't expect to grow freakishly
huge muscles overnight.

15:07.384 --> 15:08.690
Are you making
friends at least?

15:08.690 --> 15:10.344
Sort of.

15:10.344 --> 15:12.433
A few of the guys woke me up
in the middle of the night

15:12.433 --> 15:15.697
and threw me
through a brick wall.

15:15.697 --> 15:19.614
That sounds less friendly
and more like a hostile attack.

15:19.614 --> 15:21.616
But you're
happy here, right?

15:21.616 --> 15:23.052
I mean, this is what's
best for you?

15:23.052 --> 15:24.706
Sure, I'm happy.

15:24.706 --> 15:27.404
Because you're
finally proud of me.

15:27.404 --> 15:30.059
Timmy, I'm always
proud of you.

15:30.059 --> 15:32.932
I mean, sure, maybe
I don't always show it.

15:32.932 --> 15:34.455
And, sure, there's
plenty of times

15:34.455 --> 15:36.718
when I don't feel
proud of you,

15:36.718 --> 15:41.375
but, well, I guess that's
sort of the end of the thought.

15:41.375 --> 15:43.290
Aw, geez.

15:43.290 --> 15:45.248
Come with me.

15:45.248 --> 15:47.163
But I have to
finish my rocks.

15:47.163 --> 15:48.686
Oh, that's okay.

15:48.686 --> 15:51.080
I'm sure these beefcakes
can handle a few extra.

15:51.080 --> 15:52.777
Hey, one for the road.

15:57.957 --> 16:02.657
Hey, I made it to my own bed
with zero repercussions.

16:02.657 --> 16:04.746
Guess I'm not too old
to party after all.

16:04.746 --> 16:05.834
Huh.

16:07.531 --> 16:11.666
Into your arms, we commend
Freya's spirit, oh, Lord.

16:11.666 --> 16:13.668
Uh, what's going on?

16:13.668 --> 16:15.800
Hey, yeah.

16:15.800 --> 16:17.802
You fully died last night.

16:17.802 --> 16:20.501
What? Really?
That's embarrassing.

16:20.501 --> 16:22.851
She's lives!
It's a miracle.

16:22.851 --> 16:24.374
Yo, hey, I'm kind of
in the middle

16:24.374 --> 16:25.636
of a conversation
right now, so.

16:25.636 --> 16:27.725
Did you witness
the afterlife?

16:27.725 --> 16:29.771
Please, you must bestow
your knowledge upon us.

16:29.771 --> 16:31.642
Fine, yeah,
I went to hell,

16:31.642 --> 16:33.035
and it's exactly
like everyone thinks.

16:33.035 --> 16:34.515
Everything's on fire,
and the Devil

16:34.515 --> 16:35.646
stuck a pitchfork
in my ass.

16:35.646 --> 16:37.518
Now will you
please shut up?

16:37.518 --> 16:39.259
Anyways, I'm glad
you're feeling better

16:39.259 --> 16:42.044
because there is this
awesome clone party tonight.

16:42.044 --> 16:43.350
That's where
you get cloned

16:43.350 --> 16:44.829
so you can have sex
with yourself.

16:44.829 --> 16:46.309
It's so cool
because afterwards,

16:46.309 --> 16:47.919
they kill one of you,
and you don't know if

16:47.919 --> 16:49.486
you're the clone
or the original.

16:49.486 --> 16:52.272
I mean,
that does sound fun.

16:52.272 --> 16:54.491
But I think
I need a night off.

16:54.491 --> 16:56.624
So, what, you're just
gonna abandon me?

16:56.624 --> 16:58.104
It's not like I want to.

16:58.104 --> 17:00.280
I just-- I'm too old
to keep partying like this.

17:00.280 --> 17:03.500
Okay, fine, then go home
and be a loser.

17:03.500 --> 17:06.112
I'm gonna go 69 myself.

17:06.112 --> 17:07.504
Tai, wait!

17:07.504 --> 17:09.811
Please, tell us more
from the Great Beyond.

17:09.811 --> 17:13.423
Will you give it a rest?
You're, like, obsessed.

17:13.423 --> 17:16.861
I'd like to place an order
for more black pants, please.

17:16.861 --> 17:18.254
That's right, I wear them
every day.

17:19.777 --> 17:22.867
Sorry, I need
to call you back.

17:22.867 --> 17:24.652
What the hell are you
doing here?

17:24.652 --> 17:27.698
Yeah, what are we
doing here, Dad?

17:27.698 --> 17:29.222
I brought you here
because I got to

17:29.222 --> 17:31.006
come clean
about something.

17:31.006 --> 17:35.532
Now, now, let's not go saying
something we might regret.

17:35.532 --> 17:40.537
The truth is I cheated
to get you into Strong.

17:40.537 --> 17:42.322
- Timmy 1: You did?
- Why?

17:42.322 --> 17:45.064
I thought I was doing
what was best for you.

17:45.064 --> 17:48.719
But really, I was just trying
to make you more like me.

17:48.719 --> 17:50.547
It was wrong of me
to do it.

17:50.547 --> 17:54.290
I'm proud of the person
that you are.

18:00.035 --> 18:03.647
What a touching moment
between father and son.

18:03.647 --> 18:04.953
Hmm.

18:04.953 --> 18:06.694
Too bad no one's
gonna find out about it.

18:06.694 --> 18:08.652
Whoa, take it easy!

18:08.652 --> 18:13.222
I'm not going to let you destroy
everything I've worked for.

18:13.222 --> 18:15.877
I've determined your house,
Mr. Rubinstein.

18:15.877 --> 18:17.313
You're in...

18:17.313 --> 18:18.880
Dead.

18:18.880 --> 18:20.273
Ow!

18:20.273 --> 18:23.580
Timmy!
That was so...

18:23.580 --> 18:25.582
Heroic!

18:25.582 --> 18:28.063
And this time, I don't mean
it as an insult.

18:28.063 --> 18:29.717
Thank you, Dad.

18:39.988 --> 18:42.033
Another weird, long day.

18:42.033 --> 18:44.601
Hey, Sid.
- Aah! Intruder!

18:44.601 --> 18:46.386
Sid, it's just me.

18:46.386 --> 18:49.519
Sorry, I thought you'd
be out with Tai still.

18:49.519 --> 18:51.304
It destroys my soul
to say this,

18:51.304 --> 18:54.524
but I think
I need a night in.

18:54.524 --> 18:57.048
Well, in that case,
allow me to introduce you

18:57.048 --> 18:59.573
to Sid's Evening Ritual
for Rest and Relaxation.

18:59.573 --> 19:02.706
You have a name for
it? That's so lame.

19:02.706 --> 19:06.623
Okay, first off, we have
a strict no-shoes policy.

19:06.623 --> 19:07.668
Okay.

19:09.060 --> 19:11.889
Next, we'll get
some pillows going.

19:11.889 --> 19:14.196
And a nice blanket. Mm.

19:14.196 --> 19:18.026
And then we will crack
into this jigsaw puzzle.

19:18.026 --> 19:20.071
Aww, kitty!

19:20.071 --> 19:22.030
I mean, yeah,
I guess that could be cool.

19:22.030 --> 19:24.163
Oh, and a pro-tip?
Let's brush our teeth now,

19:24.163 --> 19:26.034
so we can go to bed
as soon as we're sleepy.

19:26.034 --> 19:28.471
Okay, now
that's freakin' rules.

19:28.471 --> 19:30.865
I would love to relax,

19:30.865 --> 19:32.649
but I got to finish
grading these papers.

19:32.649 --> 19:34.347
Oh, no, Scraps,

19:34.347 --> 19:36.044
y-y-you don't have to
pretend to be a teacher anymore.

19:36.044 --> 19:37.567
Who's Scraps?

19:37.567 --> 19:39.917
It's Professor Scraps.

19:39.917 --> 19:41.397
It's a hard job,
and lord knows

19:41.397 --> 19:43.007
the pay ain't great.

19:44.574 --> 19:48.578
But at the end of the day,
I love my students.

19:48.578 --> 19:50.841
What?

19:50.841 --> 19:52.669
Don't ask.

19:52.669 --> 19:54.149
It's too stupid.
