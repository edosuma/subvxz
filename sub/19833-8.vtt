WEBVTT

00:01.295 --> 00:03.839
<i>UHTRED: lam Uhtred, son of Uhtred.</i>

00:04.381 --> 00:07.217
<i>Sigefrid and Erik's army raided our camp</i>

00:07.342 --> 00:09.761
<i>and kidnapped the Lady Aethelflaed.</i>

00:09.928 --> 00:13.056
You took my daughter into battle.

00:13.182 --> 00:17.603
<i>UHTRED: To learn her fate,
Isent my loyal men, Rypere and Sihtric,</i>

00:17.728 --> 00:19.688
<i>to Beamfleot as spies.</i>

00:19.813 --> 00:23.775
I swear that this prize
will not be sold cheaply.

00:23.901 --> 00:24.943
(CHEERING)

00:25.068 --> 00:28.822
Wessex shall pay its share of silver
and if necessary its share of blood.

00:28.947 --> 00:30.407
I will do what needs to be done.

00:30.532 --> 00:33.410
What's your opinion
on paying a ransom for Aethelflaed?

00:33.535 --> 00:35.454
Not one I am prepared to say aloud.

00:35.579 --> 00:37.122
I may need you.

00:37.456 --> 00:40.209
<i>UHTRED: Alfred sent us
to negotiate the ransom,</i>

00:40.334 --> 00:44.129
<i>but secretly Aethelflaed and Erik
had fallen in love.</i>

00:44.254 --> 00:45.881
Your husband's a fortunate man.

00:47.090 --> 00:48.342
(GASPS)

00:48.508 --> 00:50.969
He is not the man
I would choose to be with.

00:51.887 --> 00:53.555
I cannot let her go.

00:54.348 --> 00:57.517
I will leave this place with Erik
or I will not leave at all.

00:57.643 --> 01:00.437
Will you help me, please?

01:01.146 --> 01:02.981
<i>UHTRED: Destiny is all.</i>

01:47.609 --> 01:50.487
PYRLIG: What binds a man to a land?

01:50.612 --> 01:53.282
You have a poor wretch,
toiling in the fields.

01:53.782 --> 01:57.411
Burning in summer, shivering in winter.

01:57.536 --> 01:59.496
He works all day every day

01:59.621 --> 02:02.874
for nothing more than a loaf of bread
and a pot to piss in.

02:04.042 --> 02:07.921
His children die of disease,
his wife dies giving him children.

02:08.422 --> 02:13.593
Yet when that land is threatened,
something stirs. Why?

02:13.719 --> 02:16.596
It is the land that feeds him.

02:16.722 --> 02:18.056
More than that.

02:19.224 --> 02:22.936
That the trees off the land
are used for shelter, fire.

02:23.061 --> 02:24.438
More than that.

02:25.397 --> 02:27.274
Is it love, Father?

02:27.399 --> 02:31.737
Oh, for the Lord's sake,
can you not remain quiet?

02:31.862 --> 02:35.073
But, yes, the bastard has it.

02:35.240 --> 02:36.908
It can only be love.

02:38.285 --> 02:41.830
It is a powerful thing.
Would you not agree, Lord Uhtred?

02:44.333 --> 02:45.667
From wretch to warrior,

02:45.792 --> 02:51.006
love gives a man strength,
often at the cost of his mind.

02:59.473 --> 03:00.515
How much?

03:02.059 --> 03:04.186
It's not a small amount, Lord.

03:05.687 --> 03:09.191
Three thousand pounds' weight of silver
and 500 pounds' weight of gold.

03:10.359 --> 03:12.903
The first of the metal is to be
delivered by the next full moon,

03:13.028 --> 03:14.780
the remaining amount one month later.

03:14.905 --> 03:17.699
- That is an impossible amount.
- An absurd amount.

03:17.824 --> 03:20.202
- That is the best price?
- It is, lord.

03:20.327 --> 03:22.579
It is less than half
their first demand, lord.

03:22.704 --> 03:24.790
What it is
is the entire wealth of Wessex.

03:24.956 --> 03:29.127
What it would buy is an anny
to ensure the end of Wessex and Mercia.

03:29.294 --> 03:30.420
Without the money...

03:32.964 --> 03:34.966
what will happen to my daughter?

03:36.927 --> 03:39.346
She's too valuable to simply kill, lord.

03:39.513 --> 03:41.807
It would be humiliation.

03:41.932 --> 03:45.102
She will be taken
to every town where Danes rule.

03:45.227 --> 03:48.146
She will be paraded
before mocking crowds.

03:49.606 --> 03:51.983
And men would pay to take their turn.

04:12.087 --> 04:16.632
It is notjust the life and reputation
of my daughter at stake here.

04:18.593 --> 04:20.637
It is the dignity of Wessex.

04:20.762 --> 04:25.642
So many thousands of men must die, lord,
for the dignity of Wessex?

04:25.767 --> 04:27.144
Yes, Odda.

04:28.311 --> 04:30.814
A country is its history,
the sum of all its stories.

04:30.939 --> 04:32.941
We are what our fathers made us.

04:33.650 --> 04:36.570
Would you have me leave my descendants
the shameful tale

04:36.695 --> 04:41.616
of how a princess of Wessex
was whored to the highest bidder?

04:41.741 --> 04:44.536
AELSWITH: That is a tale
that would overshadow all others.

04:45.537 --> 04:48.206
The battle of Ethandun
would become insignificant.

04:48.415 --> 04:53.420
But, lord, if we pay this ransom,
I do not see how there will be a Wessex.

04:53.587 --> 04:55.547
The tale they tell will be of the king

04:55.714 --> 04:57.674
who paid for the very army
that destroyed him.

04:57.799 --> 05:01.344
- God would not allow that to happen.
- It's not God we are dealing with.

05:01.470 --> 05:03.096
It is the Northmen, the Danes!

05:03.221 --> 05:06.183
Non-believers,
over whom we will triumph.

05:06.349 --> 05:09.519
Should a great battle come of this,
we shall have men enough to face them.

05:09.644 --> 05:11.897
I expect the fyrd of Mercia
to be at our side.

05:12.022 --> 05:13.857
Shall be there, lord.

05:13.982 --> 05:15.775
The metal will be paid in full.

05:15.901 --> 05:19.779
My daughter will be spared
and Wessex shall avoid indignity.

05:19.905 --> 05:21.573
But not the slaughter.

05:22.532 --> 05:26.661
Odda, I hear your doubts
and I ask you to renew your faith.

05:30.040 --> 05:31.333
Yes, lord.

05:32.417 --> 05:36.046
Aethelred, you will join Father Beocca
and I before returning to Mercia.

05:36.171 --> 05:39.090
We must decide how best
to gather the ransom.

05:39.216 --> 05:40.884
Yes, lord.

05:46.431 --> 05:48.600
This cannot be how it ends.

05:48.725 --> 05:51.478
Lord, you have said all you can say.

05:51.603 --> 05:52.646
And bravely.

05:52.771 --> 05:57.651
There's nothing more for you to do,
so I beg you... do nothing.

06:21.258 --> 06:22.300
Lord.

06:31.184 --> 06:32.227
Lord.

06:33.853 --> 06:35.605
Dagfinn, you can go.

06:37.857 --> 06:40.402
- All of you.
- Yes, lord.

06:41.653 --> 06:42.696
Do you have it?

06:46.533 --> 06:49.536
- Is that enough?
- Yes.

06:52.789 --> 06:53.790
Uhtred can read?

06:53.915 --> 06:57.419
All of my father's ealdormen
can read and write.

06:57.544 --> 07:00.880
Although the letters Uhtred has written
you could count with one finger.

07:01.006 --> 07:02.924
Hm.

07:04.593 --> 07:06.011
I will teach you.

07:08.513 --> 07:10.807
What is to prevent him
from doing nothing?

07:10.932 --> 07:16.187
We are asking him to risk everything
for no reward. Why should he come?

07:16.354 --> 07:18.565
It is Uhtred.

07:18.690 --> 07:21.735
He will come. I swear.

07:31.786 --> 07:33.705
He is with her? Again?

07:33.830 --> 07:36.583
- He is.
- He cannot keep away from her.

07:37.083 --> 07:39.669
Let us hope he does not take her
for his wife.

07:41.212 --> 07:43.548
Or else our fortune is lost.

07:43.673 --> 07:45.675
GUARD: ls this true, huh?

07:55.018 --> 07:57.312
Sigefrid!

07:57.937 --> 07:58.980
Which woman is mine?

07:59.147 --> 08:01.816
The ugly one. (CHUCKLES)

08:02.525 --> 08:04.027
We walked them for miles.

08:04.152 --> 08:08.114
See they are fed and watered,
horses and slaves.

08:08.239 --> 08:09.491
(BOTH LAUGH)

08:16.623 --> 08:18.375
ERIK: You are called Sihtric?

08:20.251 --> 08:22.754
Yes, lord. Good evening to you, lord.

08:24.506 --> 08:26.257
Uhtred says you can be trusted.

08:27.550 --> 08:30.011
So you will take him this letter.

08:38.019 --> 08:40.188
This is a great responsibility.

08:50.949 --> 08:53.201
GISELA: They will have no peace.

08:54.285 --> 08:55.620
None.

08:57.997 --> 09:00.458
I have told them the same.

09:01.334 --> 09:03.044
But you will still help them?

09:03.169 --> 09:06.005
I must. I have no choice.

09:06.131 --> 09:09.551
If they escape,
then there will be no ransom paid.

09:09.676 --> 09:10.719
No great army.

09:10.844 --> 09:15.306
The men of Wessex are saved, yes.

09:15.432 --> 09:19.310
But what becomes of you? Of us?

09:19.477 --> 09:22.355
Alfred will see it as a betrayal.

09:22.564 --> 09:24.899
You will have broken your oath.

09:26.401 --> 09:27.694
We leave.

09:30.113 --> 09:35.160
Tomorrow I will make a sacrifice,
to keep you safe.

09:36.995 --> 09:38.621
All of us.

09:46.963 --> 09:49.716
BEOCCA: You give your name
to the scribe.

09:49.841 --> 09:53.511
The sum of your contribution
will be written beside your name.

09:54.304 --> 09:56.639
We're helping to free
the Lady Aethelflaed.

09:56.765 --> 09:58.433
MAN: We've got nothing to give!

09:58.975 --> 10:02.228
Any man or woman found to be
hiding the value of their wealth

10:02.353 --> 10:03.980
shall be punished!

10:04.898 --> 10:07.233
All must pay their share.

10:08.985 --> 10:13.531
You have the gratitude
of the king, of God.

10:23.792 --> 10:25.835
Lord.

10:25.960 --> 10:27.670
News, lord.

10:28.505 --> 10:30.298
Speak.

10:30.423 --> 10:33.843
Say to the king
exactly what you said to me. Exactly.

10:40.058 --> 10:41.810
Lord, this man is from Canterbury.

10:42.519 --> 10:45.230
The Northmen at Beamfleot
are now crossing the river

10:45.355 --> 10:47.106
and raiding directly into Wessex.

10:47.232 --> 10:52.654
They have taken my wife and daughters,
lord, the youngest just eight years.

10:52.779 --> 10:57.450
While we do nothing, lord,
but gather halfpennies from the poor.

10:59.661 --> 11:01.913
Father, you will take this man away.

11:02.038 --> 11:04.165
Feed him and give him rest at an inn.

11:09.379 --> 11:12.048
Odda, what is it you want?

11:12.173 --> 11:14.008
Lord, he is just one man,

11:14.175 --> 11:16.845
but he has lost two brothers
at Ethandun,

11:16.970 --> 11:19.597
two daughters and a wife
to the Northmen,

11:19.764 --> 11:21.474
and yet guards will knock at his door

11:21.599 --> 11:23.393
and demand one third
of the little he has,

11:23.560 --> 11:26.312
all to help preserve
the dignity of Wessex.

11:26.437 --> 11:28.857
This insolence is too much.

11:28.982 --> 11:32.694
Then in six months' time
we shall ask for his life.

11:34.237 --> 11:37.574
What I want, Lord,
is for good sense to prevail.

11:37.740 --> 11:42.495
By good sense I presume you mean
the death or humiliation of my daughter

11:42.620 --> 11:44.080
and of the reputation of Wessex.

11:44.205 --> 11:46.457
Or we march, lord, and we fight.

11:46.583 --> 11:48.877
If we march, they will kill her.

11:49.002 --> 11:53.756
And she will be considered a martyr,
for Wessex, lord, her dignity preserved!

11:53.882 --> 11:56.968
And you would still have
the Prince Edward. Your line is intact.

12:03.725 --> 12:06.936
Odda, what has saved you
from outright banishment

12:07.061 --> 12:09.230
is that you chose your king
over your own son.

12:09.355 --> 12:12.734
- Lord, I chose Wessex over my son.
- A traitor!

12:12.859 --> 12:15.945
You should at least consider
doing the same.

12:22.619 --> 12:24.579
What am I to do with you?

12:29.417 --> 12:35.465
Your injury and your appetite for wine
have robbed us both of your worth.

12:40.011 --> 12:42.221
You no longer serve a purpose.

12:46.142 --> 12:48.353
Then with your permission, lord,

12:48.478 --> 12:52.565
I shall return to my estate
and my wife at Devonshire,

12:52.690 --> 12:56.277
whilst it is still a Saxon estate.

12:58.029 --> 12:59.864
That would be for the best.

13:01.950 --> 13:04.827
Should you be needed
you will be sent for.

13:45.868 --> 13:47.912
(CREAKING)

14:00.341 --> 14:03.177
They buy the very swords
that will slay them.

14:03.302 --> 14:05.179
(FOOTSTEPS)

14:09.058 --> 14:10.268
Lord, good evening.

14:15.857 --> 14:18.067
I am a moth to the flame.

14:19.861 --> 14:22.155
Yes, it is becoming
a significant amount.

14:22.280 --> 14:26.034
Significant is the word, lord,
in its size and its effect.

14:28.494 --> 14:30.413
- Your father...
- The king?

14:34.083 --> 14:35.418
He would have done the same.

14:36.919 --> 14:39.881
Pay such a ransom
for his offspring, lord? I doubt it.

14:40.673 --> 14:42.675
I was a great disappointment to him...

14:44.135 --> 14:45.636
which I regret.

14:46.637 --> 14:51.017
But if you were not a disappointment,
Aethelwold, I may have had you killed.

14:52.351 --> 14:54.312
For the good of Wessex.

14:55.480 --> 15:00.109
Never doubt it.
Every decision I make is for my country.

15:01.903 --> 15:03.404
Yes, lord.

15:05.198 --> 15:07.658
I understand completely.

15:31.724 --> 15:33.101
Lord Odda.

15:34.685 --> 15:37.271
You will set tongues wagging,
drinking with the peasants.

15:37.396 --> 15:39.941
Let them wag if it please them.

15:41.609 --> 15:44.779
You asked me some days ago if I agree
with the payment of a ransom.

15:49.450 --> 15:50.868
I do not.

15:53.996 --> 15:58.501
If I had an army to call upon,
a fyrd to raise,

15:58.626 --> 16:00.253
lwould prove it.

16:03.256 --> 16:05.383
But I have not.

16:19.814 --> 16:21.691
I appear to have joined you, lord.

16:32.493 --> 16:34.996
He's been there for part of the day
and all of the night.

16:35.121 --> 16:37.665
He's a good man and I worry
that it will damage his reputation.

16:37.790 --> 16:40.710
If he can stand
it can only enhance his reputation.

16:42.003 --> 16:43.087
UHTRED: Lord.

16:43.921 --> 16:45.298
May we join you?

16:47.550 --> 16:49.927
Is he here still or has he already left?

16:50.928 --> 16:52.388
Aethelwold.

16:52.513 --> 16:54.807
Um... No, he is long gone, lord.

16:59.562 --> 17:04.233
- Perhaps you have drunk enough, lord.
- It is entirely possible.

17:04.358 --> 17:08.988
Though the ale they brew here is weak,
upon the orders of Alfred.

17:09.113 --> 17:10.906
(CHUCKLES) You're joking, lord.

17:11.949 --> 17:14.702
- What, that's true?
- It is, yes.

17:15.661 --> 17:19.582
It is so a man can work the next day

17:19.707 --> 17:23.169
and swords remain in scabbards.

17:27.131 --> 17:29.425
But they must not.

17:35.932 --> 17:38.142
Somebody needs a bed.

17:41.312 --> 17:43.773
- You will stay with him.
- And do what?

17:43.898 --> 17:46.359
If he needs to piss or spew,
you'll fetch him a bucket.

17:46.484 --> 17:50.696
I have a plan,
though it is likely I will die.

17:52.573 --> 17:54.867
What is this plan, lord? Tell me.

17:57.536 --> 18:00.206
I will raise the Devonshire fyrd.

18:00.790 --> 18:02.541
Against the king's wishes, lord?

18:04.168 --> 18:06.629
That is not something he would forgive.

18:07.213 --> 18:08.589
Lord!

18:09.507 --> 18:10.841
(BREATH ES HEAVILY)

18:14.220 --> 18:15.805
UHTRED: He will go nowhere.

18:16.806 --> 18:20.226
And you will go nowhere and you will say
nothing about what you've just heard.

18:20.351 --> 18:22.687
- Yes, lord.
- You mean, "No, lord."

18:24.939 --> 18:26.482
- I'll...
- Do as I say.

19:02.059 --> 19:03.644
(GROANS)

19:04.979 --> 19:06.564
(COCK CROWS)

19:21.537 --> 19:24.290
So... what does it say?

19:24.415 --> 19:26.542
Erik has enough oath-men to crew a ship.

19:27.043 --> 19:29.545
Three nights before the first
of the metal is to be delivered,

19:29.670 --> 19:32.089
we make our way downriver to Beamfleot.

19:32.256 --> 19:34.717
We kill the men
who stand guard over the ships.

19:34.842 --> 19:37.178
Erik and Aethelflaed sail away.

19:37.303 --> 19:38.429
And Wessex is saved.

19:38.554 --> 19:41.474
- How many guards?
- Eight or ten, on the shore.

19:41.599 --> 19:43.017
- That is all?
- Yes.

19:43.184 --> 19:45.269
- It's as simple as that?
- Erik is in command.

19:45.394 --> 19:48.481
His men guard Aethelflaed,
his ship is ready and waiting.

19:49.607 --> 19:52.068
It begins as simple.
What happens is fate.

19:52.234 --> 19:54.570
Why go by river and not horseback?

19:55.404 --> 19:57.656
If we go with the tides it'll be faster,

19:57.782 --> 19:59.408
and to escape we row across river.

19:59.533 --> 20:01.243
They will follow you.

20:01.911 --> 20:04.538
They will follow Aethelflaed.

20:04.663 --> 20:06.832
She's the silver.

20:24.433 --> 20:25.726
Father Pyrlig.

20:25.851 --> 20:29.605
Lord, you came from nowhere,
like the devil himself.

20:29.730 --> 20:31.482
You are leaving us?

20:31.607 --> 20:35.236
I am. I've invited myself to Devonshire
with the Lord Odda.

20:36.237 --> 20:39.448
I'm looking forward to cooling my feet
in the blue waters of the sea.

20:39.573 --> 20:40.991
You're spying for Alfred.

20:41.117 --> 20:44.412
Of course I'm spying for Alfred.
I despise the sea.

20:46.705 --> 20:52.378
Should Odda decide to do anything rash,
you will tell him to hold fast?

20:52.503 --> 20:54.880
And why should he listen to me?

20:55.005 --> 20:57.049
Do you have a reason
you would like to share?

20:59.760 --> 21:01.053
(SOFTLY) And he's behind you.

21:03.389 --> 21:04.432
Lord.

21:04.557 --> 21:06.058
Did you sleep well?

21:06.183 --> 21:09.937
Uhtred. I did, soundly.

21:10.062 --> 21:12.565
Though I'm not sure how I found my bed.

21:12.731 --> 21:16.861
You were a little worse for ale, lord,
but no bother.

21:16.986 --> 21:19.488
- I'm glad to hear it.
- (CLEARS THROAT)

21:19.613 --> 21:20.781
You spoke of a plan.

21:23.826 --> 21:25.578
- I did?
- Mm-hm.

21:26.579 --> 21:27.997
Am I to be reminded?

21:29.665 --> 21:31.292
The men of Devonshire.

21:32.168 --> 21:34.128
They should remain in the fields.

21:36.046 --> 21:37.798
I must have been very drunk.

21:38.340 --> 21:40.843
- It can be the only explanation, lord.
- Yes.

21:41.886 --> 21:43.012
You swear?

21:44.221 --> 21:45.806
On my life.

21:45.973 --> 21:48.058
I have no memory of it whatsoever.

21:49.477 --> 21:51.896
Lord Odda, I say this to you
as your friend.

21:53.606 --> 21:54.940
Do nothing.

21:56.942 --> 22:00.529
If I do not see you again,
Uhtred of Bebbanburg,

22:00.696 --> 22:02.615
I wish you good luck.

22:03.491 --> 22:05.659
Wherever fate may take you.

22:06.827 --> 22:08.120
Thank you, lord.

22:29.850 --> 22:33.187
Should we pray, lord? Together?

22:36.106 --> 22:38.526
Am I being selfish

22:38.651 --> 22:40.653
in wanting to spare Aethelflaed?

22:42.488 --> 22:47.368
Lord, you were a father
before you were a king.

22:48.494 --> 22:51.038
But your reasons stand.

22:51.163 --> 22:53.290
She is Wessex.

22:54.375 --> 22:58.420
She is the blood, the heart
and the spirit of Wessex.

22:59.922 --> 23:02.424
She cannot be humiliated.

23:30.828 --> 23:31.870
Dagfinn!

23:33.581 --> 23:35.791
Dagfinn. Where is she?

23:35.916 --> 23:36.917
Lord?

23:37.042 --> 23:39.003
Where is she?

23:51.181 --> 23:52.933
SIGEFRID: Now it is clear.

23:53.809 --> 23:56.520
Each man has a right to see her.

23:57.438 --> 24:01.191
And every man will guard her
with his life!

24:04.612 --> 24:06.572
She is our wealth.

24:06.697 --> 24:08.782
She belongs to us all!

24:08.949 --> 24:10.200
(CHEERING)

24:25.674 --> 24:28.677
Dear God! Who might they be?

24:28.969 --> 24:32.306
They are the Devonshire fyrd,
Father Pyrlig.

24:36.268 --> 24:39.855
You are here as Alfred's spy
and will go no further.

24:39.980 --> 24:43.776
You will get down from your horse and
walk back to Winchester with your news.

24:44.777 --> 24:46.737
What news is that, lord?
What do you mean?

24:46.862 --> 24:51.367
You will tell the king that Odda is
marching against the enemies of Wessex.

24:51.533 --> 24:55.871
He can either march to halt me or march
to join me. lt does not matter which.

24:55.996 --> 25:00.084
Once the Northmen at Beamfleot
see an army, a battle will follow.

25:00.209 --> 25:03.504
Please, lord. Think what you are doing.
You are making traitors of your men.

25:03.629 --> 25:06.590
The men you see
are here to die for their king,

25:06.715 --> 25:08.801
not betray him.

25:08.926 --> 25:10.928
They know nothing of Alfred's weakness.

25:11.053 --> 25:14.431
But, Uhtred, lord...
Did he not ask you to do nothing?

25:14.640 --> 25:17.893
You will get down from your horse
and you will return to Winchester.

25:18.018 --> 25:19.520
And if I refuse?

25:20.437 --> 25:23.023
Now, Father Pyrlig.

25:36.161 --> 25:37.955
Lord, I beg you...

25:38.580 --> 25:40.040
Think again!

25:45.671 --> 25:47.131
(MEN SHOUTING)

25:49.049 --> 25:50.426
(BANGING)

25:52.094 --> 25:53.470
(WOMAN SOBBING)

26:08.068 --> 26:09.069
Thank you.

26:12.781 --> 26:14.241
What's your name?

26:39.683 --> 26:41.727
I asked for ten, Dagfinn.

26:43.103 --> 26:46.148
How are we supposed to scrub down a ship
with three men?

26:46.315 --> 26:49.067
The men refuse to leave the hall, lord.

26:49.902 --> 26:51.695
Refuse?

26:51.820 --> 26:56.116
They say they are protecting their
wealth, under the orders of Sigefrid.

26:57.326 --> 26:59.203
Who said this? Name them.

27:04.458 --> 27:08.629
Your brother has called for more guards,
lord, until the metal comes.

27:10.798 --> 27:12.049
Erik.

27:13.717 --> 27:15.803
You have been sleeping at the river.

27:17.221 --> 27:18.263
Why?

27:19.056 --> 27:21.225
You have made a fool of me.

27:24.394 --> 27:26.480
You have humped her enough.

27:27.105 --> 27:31.026
You have fed and washed her enough.

27:31.151 --> 27:34.029
Do not allow the men to see
what I know for certain.

27:34.154 --> 27:36.698
You have grown too fond of her.

27:36.824 --> 27:41.453
It is not her arse you want.
It is herself. It will pass.

27:43.539 --> 27:44.957
You have shamed me.

27:47.209 --> 27:51.713
What I have done... is protect you.

27:53.882 --> 27:57.511
Erik, my brother, what is happening
around us is your plan.

27:57.678 --> 28:01.682
And it is a fine plan, to give up
Lundene and take the princess,

28:01.807 --> 28:04.309
to ransom her for ships
full of gold and silver,

28:04.476 --> 28:09.064
on which we will build an army
that no man will want to face

28:09.189 --> 28:12.109
and every man will want to join.

28:14.152 --> 28:17.197
This... will be our land.

28:18.490 --> 28:20.325
All of it.

28:22.744 --> 28:26.164
I will not allow us to fail.

28:29.293 --> 28:31.461
SIGEFRID: Haesten!
A guard every ten paces.

28:31.628 --> 28:33.088
Yes, lord.

28:34.172 --> 28:36.466
Forgive me, lord.

28:36.592 --> 28:39.553
It's not that the men
do not want to serve you.

28:39.720 --> 28:43.891
It's that they do not know
where your loyalties lie.

28:54.943 --> 28:56.904
(PANTING)

28:59.197 --> 29:01.241

Oh, sweet Jesus, I cannot run.

29:05.287 --> 29:07.331
Please let them be Saxon.

29:09.541 --> 29:10.667
Father Pyrlig!

29:11.668 --> 29:15.130
Lord! Thank the heavens!
A friendly face.

29:15.255 --> 29:16.924
Are you lost, Father?

29:17.049 --> 29:19.009
Not lost, but abandoned, lord.

29:19.134 --> 29:22.137
I'm returning to Winchester
with an important message for Alfred.

29:22.930 --> 29:24.473
We're going to see Alfred.

29:24.598 --> 29:27.309
Climb onto the cart.
You can help guard Mercia's ransom.

29:27.434 --> 29:31.104
God bless you, lord,
saviour of my blistered feet.

29:48.789 --> 29:49.831
Lord?

29:50.540 --> 29:51.792
Osferth?

30:01.927 --> 30:04.304
Can I say to you that I'm afraid?

30:06.682 --> 30:09.059
I wear a sword
but barely know how to use it.

30:10.727 --> 30:15.399
I pray that when battle comes...
I will not fail you.

30:15.524 --> 30:17.526
Osferth, at times we're all afraid.

30:18.527 --> 30:22.322
Courage is finding the will
to overcome your fear. Nothing more.

30:23.198 --> 30:26.243
Perhaps we'll find you an axe.
It requires less skill than a sword.

30:27.285 --> 30:29.413
But you must find the courage.

30:30.497 --> 30:31.999
Yes, lord.

30:33.333 --> 30:35.210
Thank you, lord.

30:58.066 --> 30:59.317
- Lord.
- Lord King.

30:59.443 --> 31:02.779
Father Pyrlig.
Aethelred and Aldhelm I was expecting.

31:02.946 --> 31:05.073
It is Odda, lord.

31:05.198 --> 31:07.617
Prior to leaving Winchester,
he sent a man, some man,

31:07.743 --> 31:10.245
with word to raise
the fighting men of Devonshire.

31:10.370 --> 31:12.247
He has now met them on the road, lord.

31:12.372 --> 31:16.752
- With the intention of doing what?
- He is marching against Beamfleot.

31:16.877 --> 31:18.420
Yes, lord. He is.

31:35.979 --> 31:37.439
(SOFTLY) Damn him.

31:40.067 --> 31:41.818
Isay damn him.

31:46.490 --> 31:47.532
Lord, are we to stop him?

31:47.699 --> 31:49.910
We have no choice but to stop him.
We must stop him.

31:50.035 --> 31:52.079
Lord, may I ask, where is Uhtred?

31:52.204 --> 31:54.247
He was not beside Odda,
if that is your meaning

31:54.372 --> 31:57.250
and it cannot have been Uhtred
who carried the message to Devonshire.

31:57.375 --> 31:58.418
Aethelred, you have how many men?

31:58.543 --> 32:01.338
Over 50, lord, household guard.
I can send for many more.

32:01.463 --> 32:03.465
You will do that.
Rest your men and horses,

32:03.590 --> 32:06.093
but you will join me and my own guard
before first light.

32:06.218 --> 32:07.761
If we are to halt Odda,

32:07.928 --> 32:10.555
we must march day and night

32:10.680 --> 32:12.140
and we must pray.

32:13.141 --> 32:15.393
AETHELFLAED: Dear Lord God <i>in</i> heaven.

32:16.520 --> 32:21.024
<i>Grant me the strength
to survive this ordeal.</i>

<i>Give</i> me <i>the courage

32:44.464 --> 32:46.466
Lord, I beg of you.

32:48.218 --> 32:50.220
- Amen.
- Amen.

32:55.058 --> 32:57.561
You! With me!

33:29.009 --> 33:31.803
Sihtric, you said there'd be
no more than eight or ten.

33:32.012 --> 33:33.054
He cannot count.

33:33.180 --> 33:35.390
No, lord. It has never been
more than ten men.

33:35.515 --> 33:38.018
Rypere's group will strike
first from the water.

33:38.185 --> 33:40.520
They look to the river and then...

33:41.563 --> 33:42.772
we kill them.

33:42.898 --> 33:44.316
But, lord, we are just 11.

- Two each.
- We attack as soon as it's dark.

34:00.165 --> 34:01.708
May I Speak?

34:07.505 --> 34:09.341
I've something to say!

34:11.051 --> 34:14.137
I've something to say to each of you.

34:14.971 --> 34:21.478
You will be disappointed to know
that this woman here is now mine!

34:21.603 --> 34:23.855
No man is to touch her.

and most certainly not with his cock!

34:38.995 --> 34:43.083
It should have been me who took
the princess and put her in the cage.

34:45.585 --> 34:47.879
Yes. You are right.

34:49.505 --> 34:52.300
I... did not think.

You never think.

34:54.886 --> 34:56.554
No.

to the monastery as Alfred would wish.

38:00.572 --> 38:03.491
We shall rest, for a short time only.

38:04.742 --> 38:09.122
Take rest! Stay alert!
I want watchmen front and rear.

38:09.330 --> 38:12.459
Feed the horses and yourselves.

38:12.876 --> 38:14.919
Odda is out there. He is near.

38:16.504 --> 38:18.381
As is Aethelflaed, lord.

38:19.424 --> 38:21.009
We are here for Odda.

38:27.223 --> 38:29.559
Erik should have been here
by now.

38:30.602 --> 38:34.063
Something's wrong. Why increase
the number of guards? For what reason?

38:34.189 --> 38:36.107
- Do we care?
- They are dead.

38:41.446 --> 38:43.531
We go to the fortress.

38:43.698 --> 38:46.034
- We do?
- We came to free Aethelflaed.

38:46.159 --> 38:49.579
- We came to kill the guards.
- Bastard, you will say nothing.

38:50.830 --> 38:52.749
The guards will soon
be discovered missing.

38:52.874 --> 38:55.877
And when they are, it's over.
We cannot wait.

38:56.002 --> 38:58.004
But, lord, we have lost half our men.

38:59.714 --> 39:02.634
And there are hundreds of them,
both inside and outside the fortress.

39:02.759 --> 39:05.845
And a few more men will not be noticed.

39:09.265 --> 39:11.059
We go to the fortress.

but you are here.

39:53.768 --> 39:55.019

39:56.104 --> 39:57.772
In truth?

39:58.982 --> 40:00.024
It is hopeless.

40:02.443 --> 40:04.654
I have no crew for my ship.

40:04.779 --> 40:07.532
But the first task is not
how we escape Beamfleot,

40:07.657 --> 40:09.617

the next idiot, but this is beyond us.

40:17.542 --> 40:18.710
She's inside the hall?

40:18.835 --> 40:22.463

surrounded by men.

40:22.589 --> 40:23.965
