- Yeah. But why?

10:15.656 --> 10:16.824
[Meaner] <i>We're bees.</i>

10:16.907 --> 10:19.493
<i>I'll do yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
whatever you say.</i>

10:20.745 --> 10:24.749
Fencing lesson's over.
Time to fly like yeah-yeah-yeah bees.

10:24.832 --> 10:25.916
Uh, sid he say "fly"?

10:26.000 --> 10:28.753
[Melvin] No! I was about
to parry-parry riposte.

10:33.716 --> 10:36.886
Wait. Our lunch is honey
with a side of honey dipped in honey?

10:36.969 --> 10:39.972
- I mean, I like honey, but come on.

10:45.269 --> 10:46.604
Look, another butt wiggle.

10:46.687 --> 10:47.730
[buzzing]

10:48.689 --> 10:50.900
Time for us to get to the bottom
of that bottom.

10:54.528 --> 10:55.613
Looks like a hive.

10:55.780 --> 10:56.864
[belches]

10:57.281 --> 11:01.577
Wait. Hive, honey, hexagons?
What do they all have in common?

11:01.994 --> 11:05.331
They all start with "H"?
[gasps] Oh, no. So does Harold.

11:05.790 --> 11:06.874
That means I'm in on it.

11:06.957 --> 11:10.961
No, it's something else.
But I have no idea what. Ah! Bee!

11:12.088 --> 11:13.881
Yeah, me neither. Gah!

11:13.964 --> 11:15.257
[sighs] Another bee.

11:15.841 --> 11:16.759
- Bees!
- Bees!

11:16.842 --> 11:19.428
Teachers, bees.
The teachers are turning into...

11:19.512 --> 11:20.346
Beechers.

11:20.429 --> 11:22.032
There's only two people who could do this.

11:22.056 --> 11:23.474
And they're both Melvin.

11:24.183 --> 11:27.019
See? We didn't tell the teachers
to build a hive.

11:27.103 --> 11:30.689
Hive building is normal bee behavior.
And nothing to worry about.

11:30.773 --> 11:33.442
Yes, it is. I know when I'm lying
and you're lying.

11:33.526 --> 11:34.777
'Cause it's me lying.

11:36.862 --> 11:39.407
Mr. Krupp, the Melvins
are turning teachers into bees.

11:39.490 --> 11:41.409
- And?
- And we need your help to stop them.

11:41.492 --> 11:42.660
Me? Why me?

11:42.743 --> 11:44.870
- Because you're the principal.
- Vice principal.

11:44.954 --> 11:46.330
- [both] Vice principal?
- Ugh!

11:46.414 --> 11:50.167
I don't even have my own office anymore.
I have to share one with her.

11:50.251 --> 11:53.129
I mean, she's eating an onion
like an apple. An onion!

11:53.921 --> 11:56.006
[crunching]

11:57.174 --> 11:59.301
- Do you mind?
- [muffled] Did you call me?

11:59.385 --> 12:02.012
[groans] No! And why are you eating that?

12:02.096 --> 12:04.807
- So there's nothing you can do?
- No, I mean, I di... Wait.

12:04.890 --> 12:08.853
Well, there is one thing I can do
to end all of our problems.

12:08.936 --> 12:10.855
[cackles]

12:10.938 --> 12:11.981
- Great.
- Thanks.

12:13.149 --> 12:17.236
I'm going to betray those boys
and get a new office for it.

12:18.070 --> 12:19.572
Are you talking to me?

12:19.738 --> 12:22.575
No. I'm talking to me! [chuckles]

12:22.658 --> 12:23.658
Yes!

12:25.244 --> 12:26.328
[crunches, grunts]

[narrator] <i>The queen bee, aka Ms. Ribble,
got the kids buzz-y working on the hive.</i>

12:36.130 --> 12:38.382
Man, I'm never gonna get hexagons.

12:38.466 --> 12:41.594
Me neither. You know,
I might actually like the new Krupp.

12:41.677 --> 12:44.555
Yeah. He wasn't cut out for the pressure
of being number one.

12:44.722 --> 12:46.348
He's a much better number two.

12:46.432 --> 12:48.434
Ha! Turd-burn. Nice.

12:48.809 --> 12:52.480
I'm glad this Krupp is T.C.O.B. now.
Taking Care Of Bees-ness.

12:52.563 --> 12:55.649
Starting with Ms. Ribble.
He'll find out what's behind that behind.

12:55.733 --> 12:57.943
Ooh! That gives me a great idea
for a new villain.

12:58.027 --> 12:59.612
Cool. Let's make a comic.

13:01.238 --> 13:02.072
[George giggles]

13:02.156 --> 13:03.073
[narrator] <i>Chapter three:</i>

13:03.157 --> 13:05.367

13:05.451 --> 13:06.845
<i>By George Beard and Harold Hutchins.</i>

13:06.869 --> 13:08.889

13:14.376 --> 13:16.003
<i>Anyways, Ms. Beegotten's beehive hairdo</i>

13:16.086 --> 13:18.255
<i>started attracting killer bees
to her head.</i>

13:18.339 --> 13:20.090
<i>They moved in
and threw a hair-warming party</i>

13:20.174 --> 13:22.927
<i>which sounds like a salon treatment,
but it's not, can't do it.</i>

13:23.010 --> 13:25.804
<i>But killer bee guests are kind of stingy,
and Ms. Beegotten was like,</i>

13:25.888 --> 13:27.640
<i>"Hey, get out of my groovy hairdo, bees!"</i>

13:27.723 --> 13:30.017
<i>And the killer bees were like,
"Wrong answer, lady,"</i>

13:30.100 --> 13:32.078
<i>and then stung her like crazy
to send her a message,</i>

13:32.102 --> 13:33.395
<i>which was obviously "Ouch."</i>

13:33.479 --> 13:37.525
<i>Sting stang, sting sting,
sting stang stang. Ouch. Sting.</i>

13:37.608 --> 13:40.611
<i>Ms. Beegotten got stung so much,
she turned into the Queen Zombee,</i>

13:40.694 --> 13:44.782
<i>an undead bee monster who wanted to make
everybody zombees, with two E's...</i>

13:44.865 --> 13:46.784

13:46.867 --> 13:47.910

<i>"I will make you undead bees

14:02.550 --> 14:03.550
<i>Tra-la-la!</i>

14:03.592 --> 14:05.636
<i>"So, what's up?"</i>

14:05.719 --> 14:06.929
<i>And the people said what's up,</i>

14:07.012 --> 14:09.574
<i>but with details like... we don't need
to go back into that again.</i>

14:09.598 --> 14:11.392
<i>Luckily, Captain Underpants
knew what to do.</i>

14:11.475 --> 14:12.869
<i>He was like, "Let's eat the honey."</i>

14:12.893 --> 14:14.853
<i>And Queen Zombee laughed like...</i>
[cackles]

14:14.937 --> 14:16.480
<i>Or more like... </i> [buzzing laughter]

14:16.564 --> 14:18.607
<i>'Cause bee-talk, and she thought
Captain Underpants</i>

14:22.278 --> 14:24.947
<i>But Captain Underpants
super loved the honey.</i>

14:25.030 --> 14:30.661
<i>So he ate it all and got crazy,
big, fat dinosaur.</i>

14:30.744 --> 14:31.871
<i>Big roar.</i>

14:31.954 --> 14:34.140

didn't become a zombee with two E's</i>

14:34.164 --> 14:35.749
<i>because super stomach.</i>

14:35.833 --> 14:37.593
<i>Anyway, Captain Underpants
tried to fly away.</i>

14:37.668 --> 14:40.921
<i>But he was, like, too heavy,
his maximum launch weight exceeded,</i>

14:41.005 --> 14:42.756

14:47.761 --> 14:50.097
[George] New comic.
Lot of buzz on this one.

14:50.848 --> 14:52.048
[Harold] Check this comic out.

14:52.641 --> 14:55.019
[George] This comic puts the "bee"

the teachers are building
around the school?

15:49.323 --> 15:51.241
Ignore it. More honey for your tea?

16:11.762 --> 16:15.516
So I guess you'll wanna give me
my own office as a reward?

16:16.308 --> 16:19.645
- No, we're not doing that.
- But you have to. The onion.

16:19.728 --> 16:21.981

16:32.908 --> 16:33.969
- Is that a hair dryer?
- No.

16:33.993 --> 16:35.411
You sure? Looks like a hair dryer.

16:35.494 --> 16:38.056
It's a hive mind controller!
It allows me to control the teachers.

16:38.080 --> 16:41.125
- Does it also dry hair?
- Yes! But that's not important.

16:41.208 --> 16:43.877
Wait. What about the kids?
They're turning into bees, too.

16:43.961 --> 16:44.962
What?

16:45.045 --> 16:48.424
Injecting the teachers with bee DNA
turned them into actual bees.

Now they're using honey

16:51.343 --> 16:53.012

with such an overly complicated

16:55.431 --> 16:56.932

16:57.016 --> 17:00.185

Wait. I had a trap door
leading to a secret tunnel in my office?

17:44.688 --> 17:47.691
No. I had it installed on my first day

18:27.606 --> 18:29.024
Don't worry. It'll be fine.
