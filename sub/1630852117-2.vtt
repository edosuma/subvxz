WEBVTT

00:11.469 --> 00:12.762
I can help you.

00:14.180 --> 00:16.683
But I need you to tell me
exactly what happened

00:16.766 --> 00:18.476
if you wanna work out a deal.

00:24.107 --> 00:25.108
Did you hear me?

00:30.196 --> 00:34.075
Now you need to tell me exactly
why you helped Dr. Zane plant the bomb.

00:37.537 --> 00:39.080


00:48.506 --> 00:50.842
Yeah, you were right, mate.
Don't rub it in.

00:52.761 --> 00:54.429
You can use the damn door.

00:58.558 --> 01:00.101
Oh, God.

01:01.352 --> 01:02.687
Oh, God.

01:08.777 --> 01:10.195
Oh, Jesus. Please.

01:10.278 --> 01:11.488
You all right, boss?

01:12.072 --> 01:12.906
Yeah.

01:14.407 --> 01:17.869
Yeah, I just, uh…
I tied one on last night, man.

01:17.952 --> 01:20.288
The credits are rolling. Is he…?

01:20.371 --> 01:21.915
Hey, credits are rolling. You okay?

01:21.998 --> 01:24.334
Just give me a second, please.

01:26.961 --> 01:28.630
We'll stall 'em. We got you.

01:30.965 --> 01:32.300
I'll be right outside.

01:56.741 --> 01:59.160
All right. What's up, Philly?

01:59.244 --> 02:00.537
Yes.

02:00.620 --> 02:02.997
Wow, feeling the love. Thank you, guys.

02:03.081 --> 02:07.001
You make me feel at home.
Much appreciated. Much appreciated.

02:07.085 --> 02:09.796
Uh, well, we're not here for me,
we're here for you.

02:09.879 --> 02:13.258
I'm here to talk to you.
Questions, who's got 'em? Go ahead.

02:14.008 --> 02:15.593
I loved <i>The Anti-Verse</i>.

02:15.677 --> 02:17.887
What was it like
working with Chris Hemsworth?

02:18.429 --> 02:20.765
What was it like working
with Chris Hemsworth? Horrible!

02:20.849 --> 02:22.308
-Horrible.

02:22.392 --> 02:23.768
Hated it!

02:23.852 --> 02:25.311
Uh, it was a great time.

02:25.395 --> 02:28.148
He's a good guy.
You know, we're friends. We text.

02:28.231 --> 02:32.026
Sometimes I leave him unread just so
he can know I'm a bigger star than he is.

02:33.403 --> 02:35.488
Um, another one? Give me another question.

02:35.572 --> 02:37.031
Yes, go ahead.

02:37.115 --> 02:39.742
Hey, Kid.
What can we expect from you in the future?

02:41.661 --> 02:43.371
Wow, uh, good question.

02:46.040 --> 02:46.958
Um…

02:51.129 --> 02:53.798
What can you expect from me in the future?

02:53.882 --> 02:56.009
[suspenseful music playing

02:59.971 --> 03:02.432
To hopefully still be doing what I love.

03:07.020 --> 03:07.896
Yeah.

03:09.314 --> 03:11.232
That… that would be a bright future.

03:12.317 --> 03:13.318
Cool?

03:17.030 --> 03:20.700
Another question.
Uh, anybody, in the back? Yes.

03:51.940 --> 03:53.024
Oh!

04:42.949 --> 04:44.867
<i>You don't talk to the fucking cops!</i>

04:45.910 --> 04:47.245
<i>Still got your teeth?</i>

04:49.330 --> 04:50.707
<i> Kick him in the face.</i>

04:58.256 --> 04:59.340
What?

04:59.424 --> 05:01.718
-Tell me we good.
<i>-I can't get him in the fucking cart.</i>

05:01.801 --> 05:04.220
Okay, then you make him fit. Smash his…

05:04.304 --> 05:06.514
-Just figure it the fuck out.
-Figure it out?

05:06.597 --> 05:09.267
I wouldn't have to
if you hadn't killed the motherfucker.

05:09.350 --> 05:11.144
It's because you brought him into my life.

05:11.227 --> 05:13.021
<i>-Remember why?</i>
-Right. So act like you…

05:13.104 --> 05:14.731
Just get it done. I don't--

05:20.987 --> 05:21.904
Fuck him.

05:22.905 --> 05:23.740
Okay?

05:25.116 --> 05:26.367
-You all right?
-Yeah.

05:27.869 --> 05:30.705
Philly cops make me nervous.
Come on, y'all. Let's roll.

05:39.964 --> 05:43.551
I, uh, think we should
build up the opening tonight, Kid.

05:43.634 --> 05:47.472
You were really killing them when you
were making those stupid observations.

05:48.681 --> 05:49.515
Kid?

05:53.728 --> 05:56.189
Yeah, okay. I mean, it makes sense…

05:56.272 --> 05:57.690
It makes sense to me, so….

05:58.524 --> 06:01.486
Okay, I'll be in The Shade Room
if anybody needs me.

06:01.569 --> 06:05.656
After Children's Hospital, we got
radio stations, deal with these phoners.

06:05.740 --> 06:08.284
Then go to soundcheck,
the photo shoot, then you get to chill.

06:08.368 --> 06:11.579
-How many phoners?
-Three. Cool?

06:18.544 --> 06:19.379
What?

06:21.464 --> 06:22.298
What's up?

06:22.882 --> 06:26.052
Uh… Nothing. It's just some shit
that hit The Shade Room.

06:26.135 --> 06:27.136
-What shit?
-Um…

06:27.220 --> 06:28.304
Is it about me?

06:29.013 --> 06:31.599
-Know what, don't even worry about it.
-Is it about me or not?

06:32.183 --> 06:33.810
-I don't want…
-Billie…

06:33.893 --> 06:35.478
Answer the… Give me the fucking phone.

06:39.232 --> 06:41.067
This is what you don't wanna show me?

06:41.150 --> 06:43.027
This is what you're making a big deal of?

06:43.653 --> 06:44.821
Grow up, Billie.

07:05.883 --> 07:07.135
Fuck.

07:20.231 --> 07:21.566
I can't do this shit, man.

07:35.455 --> 07:36.831
Good morning, sir.

07:36.914 --> 07:40.543
Since you are heading out,
can we make up your brother's room?

07:41.252 --> 07:42.253
Uh…

07:47.717 --> 07:49.594
Give me a sec. A sec.

08:01.022 --> 08:04.025
The kids have been looking forward
to this special treat all week.

08:04.108 --> 08:05.568
Good.

08:11.157 --> 08:14.035
Yeah, a new plan with Carlton
is the last thing you need.

08:14.118 --> 08:16.078
-What are you doing?
-Nothing.

08:16.162 --> 08:17.580
You read my messages?

08:18.289 --> 08:20.541
Why don't you crawl in my ass
and check my temperature too?

08:20.625 --> 08:22.627
-Okay.
-What do you mean, okay?

08:23.211 --> 08:26.339
-Stay off my goddamn phone.
-Okay. Jesus.

08:28.090 --> 08:30.384
I'm sorry. Do we need a minute
before we see the kids?

08:30.468 --> 08:32.094
No. No, no, no, no, no.

08:32.845 --> 08:35.389
-No. Not at all.

08:36.599 --> 08:38.059
I'm ready. I'm ready.

08:41.103 --> 08:43.189
Hey. You guys got some stuff?

08:43.272 --> 08:44.398
Let's sign it.

08:44.482 --> 08:46.442
Wow, what signature do you want?

08:46.526 --> 08:48.319
Let me get yours. Here we go.

08:48.402 --> 08:49.862
Nice, nice, nice.

08:49.946 --> 08:51.656
Yeah, gimme one!

08:51.739 --> 08:53.366
C'mon. Pat! Pat! Pat! Pat!

08:53.449 --> 08:54.575
Wanna hold this for me?

08:54.659 --> 08:57.161
Selfie? You wanna get a selfie?
All right. Ready?

08:57.954 --> 09:00.248
Now with a peace sign.
Put out the peace signs, guys.

09:00.331 --> 09:02.583
-Peace sign. Peace.

09:03.584 --> 09:06.754
-Wanna hear a joke?
-'Course I wanna hear a joke.

09:06.837 --> 09:09.423
What's a witch's
favorite subject in school?

09:12.218 --> 09:15.471
What's a witch's
favorite subject in school?

09:16.597 --> 09:17.515
I don't know.

09:18.099 --> 09:18.933
Spelling.

09:22.019 --> 09:22.937
Did you write that?

09:24.272 --> 09:26.899
That's your bit?
That's an original bit? Wow.

09:28.192 --> 09:32.071
You gotta hurry up and get better, man.
I'm on tour. You gotta open up for me.

09:35.533 --> 09:37.577
That's not gonna happen.

09:41.038 --> 09:42.665
You ever think about death?

09:49.964 --> 09:51.257
As of late, yeah.

09:52.800 --> 09:53.759
Me too.

09:55.803 --> 09:57.722
Well, you gotta change those thoughts.

09:59.890 --> 10:01.601
Gotta make 'em good thoughts.

10:03.603 --> 10:05.896
You do that by focusing on the good.

10:07.315 --> 10:09.358
The good that you do for others.

10:09.442 --> 10:12.570
See, when you do that,
that's how you become immortal.

10:13.988 --> 10:15.948
Like your character in <i>Anti-Verse</i>?

10:16.532 --> 10:18.909
It's exactly
like my character in <i>Anti-Verse</i>.

10:20.536 --> 10:22.622
I was really glad I got to see it.

10:23.289 --> 10:25.207
I prayed to God I'd be able to.

10:28.878 --> 10:31.255
I'll give you a piece
of top-secret information.

10:32.757 --> 10:34.216
We're gonna do a sequel.

10:35.426 --> 10:36.844
Don't nobody know that.

10:36.927 --> 10:40.306
You're literally
the only person that knows.

10:40.389 --> 10:42.141
So, you can't tell nobody. Deal?

10:43.059 --> 10:45.311
If you tell somebody
then I'm not to be able to give you

10:45.394 --> 10:47.521
the signed poster
that I got for you downstairs.

10:49.315 --> 10:50.941
You're a good kid, man.

10:54.945 --> 10:57.073
You're the reason why I do what I do.

10:59.742 --> 11:01.577
That's why I'm gonna keep

11:02.453 --> 11:03.788
doing what I do.

11:09.752 --> 11:10.711
My man.

11:13.839 --> 11:16.384
Carlton, listen to me.
I'm at the hospital.

11:16.467 --> 11:19.553
I don't have time to deal with this shit.
You gotta figure it out.

11:19.637 --> 11:22.348
He won't fit in the cart.
That's what I'm telling you.

11:22.431 --> 11:24.100
We need something bigger.

11:24.183 --> 11:26.352
<i>Hey, bigger like what? Huh?</i>

11:27.353 --> 11:29.647
Like… a steamer trunk would work.

11:29.730 --> 11:32.358
You think the hotel's just got
a steamer trunk laying around?

11:32.441 --> 11:33.818
<i>You're not being helpful right now.</i>

11:33.901 --> 11:37.780
Hey. Do what the fuck he told you to do.
Chop the meat. Break the bones.

11:37.863 --> 11:41.075
<i>-Make him fit in the fucking box.</i>
What he said to do?

11:41.158 --> 11:42.159
He told you that?

11:42.243 --> 11:45.204
I don't give a fuck what he told me.
It's on you. Do it!

11:47.164 --> 11:48.791
Now I know how Todd feels.

11:50.960 --> 11:52.294
Can't contract shit.

11:53.879 --> 11:57.383
Right, so just Power 99.
Then soundcheck. Back to the hotel.

11:57.466 --> 12:00.136
Cancel Power 99,
we'll go straight to soundcheck.

12:00.219 --> 12:02.722
-I wanna go to the hotel.
-Uh-oh, your biggest fan ahead.

12:02.805 --> 12:03.639
What?

12:04.140 --> 12:07.768
Hey, Kid. Is it okay if we get a picture
out front of the hospital

12:07.852 --> 12:10.229
so we can show the fans
how you went from Boys & Girls

12:10.312 --> 12:12.440
-to the Children's Hospital?
-Listen, not today.

12:12.523 --> 12:14.066
-Please, Gene. Not today.
-What? Hey!

12:14.150 --> 12:15.526
Back up, Gene. He said not today.

12:15.609 --> 12:17.653
-Kid, it's for the fans!
-What the fuck did I say?

12:18.112 --> 12:19.655
What did I say? Stop.

12:20.698 --> 12:21.991
I said not today.

12:22.074 --> 12:25.202
Any other day I'm fine.
Today, I choose not to be.

12:25.286 --> 12:27.913
Stop being a fucking pain in the ass
and listen to me.

12:27.997 --> 12:30.458
Not today. Do you understand?

12:31.417 --> 12:32.835
-Mm-hmm.
-Fuck, man!

12:52.229 --> 12:53.189
Okay.

12:55.816 --> 12:57.985
-All right, you wanna do this right now?
-No.

12:58.068 --> 13:01.906
-Billie, I need him for a sec, okay.
-Sure thing. Above my pay grade.

13:03.616 --> 13:06.494
Look, man,
I went over the line in the elevator,

13:06.577 --> 13:08.829
but you've been acting weird all day,
and I'm concerned.

13:08.913 --> 13:11.123
Why are you concerned?
Stop being dramatic.

13:11.207 --> 13:12.374
You know what it's about.

13:12.458 --> 13:15.336
You know the shit
that's happening with Mo, with Carlton.

13:15.419 --> 13:17.880
I do. And I know those are
difficult conversations to have,

13:17.963 --> 13:20.800
but you gotta get your head on straight.
You got big decisions to make.

13:20.883 --> 13:23.177
-Okay. I understand. I gotta take this.
-Okay.

13:23.260 --> 13:24.553
Thank you. All right.

13:26.931 --> 13:29.975
-Hey, ex-wife of mine. How are you?
<i>I'm calling about the article.</i>

13:30.059 --> 13:33.354
Yes. Are you talking about that thing
with you dating your version of Jeter,

13:33.437 --> 13:34.939
the thing you failed to mention to me?

13:35.564 --> 13:38.859
The thing that now has
213,000 views on The Shade Room.

13:38.943 --> 13:40.903
And I know that not because I watched it

13:40.986 --> 13:43.155
but because I got everybody
calling my fucking phone

13:43.239 --> 13:44.990
because you can't communicate with me.

13:45.074 --> 13:47.368
<i>-I was hoping to talk to you about it.</i>
-You know what, Mo?

13:47.451 --> 13:49.912
-Can't talk now. I can't talk right now.
<i>-Um, okay--</i>

13:49.995 --> 13:51.956
Get the fuck off my phone, man.

13:52.039 --> 13:54.083
-Hersch! Come on, man.
Yo.

13:57.419 --> 14:00.297
Hey, hey. All right.
So, off the top of my head.

14:01.340 --> 14:03.676
"To hell with being a celebrity,
I wanna be an influencer."

14:03.759 --> 14:04.969
"That is next-level shit."

14:05.052 --> 14:08.055
"You got kids opening up toys on YouTube.
Bam, they're famous!"

14:08.138 --> 14:11.392
"This one kid got 26 mill
opening up a goddamn box."

14:11.475 --> 14:14.770
"I got unopened boxes at my place…"
Okay, I can see you hate this.

14:14.854 --> 14:16.564
Fine. All right.

14:16.647 --> 14:19.149
"Millennials. They think
they are so smart, but they're not."

14:19.233 --> 14:20.860
"They got Siri, Alexa, Google…"

14:20.943 --> 14:24.238
"But what I do believe is, technically,
Siri and Alexa are millennials,

14:24.321 --> 14:27.491
and that's why they get attitude
whenever you ask them a question."

14:27.575 --> 14:29.451
Tell me how to fix it.
I know you don't like it.

14:29.535 --> 14:31.495
I don't like it because they're not good.

14:32.496 --> 14:34.373
They're not good jokes. Those jokes suck.

14:34.456 --> 14:37.835
Okay, well, look, Kid,
I know you got a lot of shit on your mind,

14:37.918 --> 14:40.504
but didn't you tell me
nobody cares what you're struggling with.

14:40.588 --> 14:42.715
-They're here to see a show.
-That's what I told you.

14:42.798 --> 14:45.009
I don't need you
to repeat to me what I said to you.

14:45.092 --> 14:46.844
-Those are not good jokes.
-Okay.

14:46.927 --> 14:49.763
Those jokes are ass.
Those jokes fucking suck.

14:49.847 --> 14:52.558
-Do you understand that?
-I do. Loud and clear.

14:53.350 --> 14:55.936
And, um, just a quick reminder for you

14:56.020 --> 14:58.105
that when you're going
through some bullshit,

14:58.188 --> 15:00.858
I'm not the punching bag, okay?

15:02.109 --> 15:03.944
That's what… that's what you wanna do.

15:04.945 --> 15:06.280
Can you fucking believe this?

15:06.363 --> 15:07.281
Kid?

15:07.823 --> 15:10.159
-Rain.
-Kid, got new looks for you to try.

15:13.370 --> 15:14.371
Hold on. Hold on.

15:15.831 --> 15:18.083
Okay, Rain, look,
I don't have time to do this now,

15:18.167 --> 15:19.543
but here's what I want you to do.

15:19.627 --> 15:21.712
Take this, put it in my Sprinter van,

15:21.795 --> 15:24.048
and have it sent up to my room.
You got that?

15:24.131 --> 15:26.467
-Yeah. Got it.
-Sprinter van. Up to my room. ASAP.

15:26.550 --> 15:29.470
-I'll work it out.
-Okay. Thank you. Hey, Todd? Todd!

15:29.553 --> 15:32.681
-Yeah?
-Yo, I can't do soundcheck.

15:32.765 --> 15:34.767
Make sure it's a lot tighter
than the night before.

15:34.850 --> 15:38.437
-We came all the way here.
-I know. I'm telling you I can't do it.

15:38.520 --> 15:41.857
Your whole day is canceled.
We just have to do that photo shoot.

15:42.358 --> 15:44.151
-Okay?
-Yeah. All right.

15:44.234 --> 15:48.030
It's back at the hotel, in your suite.
Do it, get your rest, come back--

15:48.113 --> 15:50.824
What? Hold on. What did you say?
You said it's what?

15:51.325 --> 15:52.993
In the suite,
they should be setting up now

15:53.077 --> 15:54.161
What do you mean my suite?

16:00.709 --> 16:01.543
Hello?

16:01.627 --> 16:02.711
We're here.

16:03.837 --> 16:04.964
For what?

16:05.047 --> 16:06.131
Pictures.

16:07.466 --> 16:10.094
-Fuck, man. Fuck!
-We'll get 'em in and out.

16:10.177 --> 16:13.055
-Hey.
-Goddamn, Todd! I don't want you to do it.

16:13.138 --> 16:14.765
-I'll get 'em out.
-You get 'em out.

16:14.848 --> 16:17.810
Okay. Don't fucking do shit else.
Come on, Hersch.

16:20.354 --> 16:22.773
Are you the brother?
You're supposed to let us in.

16:22.856 --> 16:25.109
But they gave us a key
in case you weren't here.

16:25.192 --> 16:28.737
Okay, yeah, well, hold on a second.
Let me put some clothes on. Okay?

16:28.821 --> 16:29.738
All right.

16:46.005 --> 16:47.214
Excuse me. Excuse me.

16:53.804 --> 16:55.431
Um, I heard you were here.

16:55.514 --> 16:59.143
I'm not sure if you remember me,
I'm Andrea. I manage Fable Grill.

16:59.226 --> 17:01.270
I served you
that runny egg thing you liked.

17:01.353 --> 17:04.857
Thank you. It's good meeting you.
I really don't have the time. Okay?

17:05.649 --> 17:06.567
Thank you.

17:13.782 --> 17:17.494
So, I'm gonna head to my room
since you don't wanna grind tonight.

17:28.589 --> 17:29.757
Perfect timing.

17:30.549 --> 17:33.260
Uh, let's do some touch-ups on you
before we begin.

17:33.343 --> 17:36.597
Might Linda set up the bathroom
in the master suite?

17:37.181 --> 17:39.058
Uh, no. No.

17:41.351 --> 17:42.853
I gotta go to the bathroom, man.

17:44.396 --> 17:46.023
In that bathroom. So.

17:46.106 --> 17:48.233
-Okay. Okay.
-Yeah, let me do that.

17:48.317 --> 17:50.694
And nobody should use it after. Because…

17:51.612 --> 17:53.906
'Cause I'm a tough act to follow.
I don't want no--

18:01.080 --> 18:01.955
Carlton.

18:02.539 --> 18:03.415
Todd.

18:14.802 --> 18:16.762
He done stole the douchebag's phone cord.

18:17.971 --> 18:20.390
-Oh, my God.
-Let me get that.

18:38.617 --> 18:39.910
Hey, Rain. Come on in.

18:39.993 --> 18:41.870
-Where do you want this?
-Oh, fuck yeah.

18:42.329 --> 18:45.582
Take it into the back,
and he's gonna give us a change there.

18:45.666 --> 18:46.708
Okay, cool.

18:48.919 --> 18:51.588
Okay, good. You got my stuff up here.

18:51.672 --> 18:53.715
-Back there. Let's put it back there.
-Okay.

18:53.799 --> 18:54.842
-Okay.
-Thank you.

18:55.467 --> 18:57.719
What are we doing here? What…?

18:57.803 --> 19:00.848
-We're shooting where she set up.
-I know that. I'm saying, how much time?

19:00.931 --> 19:04.768
-We have it scheduled for an hour.
-How many looks? Four? Five?

19:04.852 --> 19:07.104
-Either.
-We said four, let's do two.

19:07.187 --> 19:09.857
Okay. I feel like
everybody's standing around,

19:09.940 --> 19:11.692
and I wanna get it done.

19:11.775 --> 19:12.776
Let's get going.

19:12.860 --> 19:14.027
-Okay.
-Ready to go.

19:14.111 --> 19:16.572
Thank you. That's all.
Just make 'em do it.

19:19.825 --> 19:20.868
Thank you.

19:22.953 --> 19:25.998
Thank you again.
Thanks again for your patience.

19:26.498 --> 19:29.459
Night, Rain. Thank you.
All right, man, I'll text you.

19:30.544 --> 19:31.753
And that's your day, sir.

19:31.837 --> 19:33.255
-Get some down time now?
-Yeah.

19:33.338 --> 19:35.424
-Big night last night, take it easy?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:35.507 --> 19:37.509
-All right. Good night.

19:40.053 --> 19:43.891
Hey. What do you say to them cats, man,
that got them hating on me like that?

19:46.143 --> 19:48.562
How about we worry about your dead friend?

19:48.645 --> 19:49.479
Huh?

19:49.563 --> 19:52.149
Oh, you mean the one that you killed?
Yeah, sure. Sure.

19:52.941 --> 19:56.236
This is where it kills me, man.
You wanna debate? That what you wanna do?

19:56.987 --> 19:58.614
Let's talk about this shit, man.

19:59.406 --> 20:03.243
Yeah, it's big enough for Ari's fat ass,
but won't fit in the car.

20:06.830 --> 20:07.831
Uh-uh.

20:07.915 --> 20:09.041
I got an idea.

20:09.875 --> 20:11.335
Yeah, I know what to do.

20:13.170 --> 20:14.171
I'll be right back.

20:18.467 --> 20:19.426
Hersch?

20:20.093 --> 20:20.928
Yo.

20:21.845 --> 20:22.971
Open up.

20:23.055 --> 20:24.181
Gimme a second.

20:25.182 --> 20:26.099
Yo.

20:27.768 --> 20:29.978
-What's up?
-Let me get the keys to the Sprinter.

20:30.062 --> 20:31.313
Okay, where we going?

20:31.396 --> 20:35.108
No, no, no. Come on, it's Philadelphia.
You know how I am when I'm home.

20:36.318 --> 20:38.320
All right, gimme a second. Gimme a sec.

20:44.660 --> 20:47.412
I'm gonna go with you,
in case you wanna talk about anything.

20:47.496 --> 20:50.457
No, no, I'm good, man.
I just wanna clear my head.

20:50.540 --> 20:53.585
-Sure you don't want me to go?
-I'm serious. I wanna clear my head.

20:53.669 --> 20:55.212
-Kid, I can go with you.
-Gimme the keys.

20:55.796 --> 20:57.339
-I'm good. Come on.
-All right.

20:58.090 --> 20:59.841
-Damn, I'm straight.

21:18.193 --> 21:20.153
Watch your hand, watch your hand.

21:20.237 --> 21:22.781
Look, I'm gonna take the van,
you take Ari's car.

21:22.864 --> 21:25.492
We'll go down by Schuylkill,
drop the body and the car there.

21:25.575 --> 21:27.286
Just leave the car at the hotel.

21:27.995 --> 21:30.706
It'll sit there for months
before motherfuckers take a look.

21:30.789 --> 21:31.707
All right.

21:42.426 --> 21:44.678
-Yo.
-I can't let you go alone, man.

21:44.761 --> 21:45.762
Hersch, this ain't--

21:45.846 --> 21:48.265
If shit happens, that's on me.
you know I can't have that.

21:48.348 --> 21:50.434
I understand.
It's not like that. I'm good.

21:50.517 --> 21:51.727
Hey, yo, Kevin Costner.

21:51.810 --> 21:54.771
You ass-kissing motherfuckers
think I can't do right by my bro,

21:54.855 --> 21:55.814
but we good, man.

21:55.897 --> 21:56.898
I got this.

21:57.482 --> 21:58.317
Kid.

21:58.400 --> 21:59.985
We're straight.

22:00.068 --> 22:02.404
-You sure?
-Yeah. We're good, man.

22:03.780 --> 22:05.073
-See?
-We're straight.

22:05.157 --> 22:06.074
All right.

22:07.993 --> 22:09.119
-Focus.
-Yeah.

22:09.202 --> 22:10.037
Focus.

22:21.465 --> 22:22.507
-One.
-Two.

22:23.633 --> 22:24.593
Lift!

22:24.676 --> 22:26.595
Motherfucker's heavy, man.

22:31.016 --> 22:33.935
Yo, we ain't out the woods yet.
Don't slip.

22:57.542 --> 23:01.588
Hey, C. If you knew Ari was a piece of
shit, why would you call him to help us?

23:03.090 --> 23:05.801
'Cause no upstanding citizen
wants to help dump a dead body.

23:16.853 --> 23:19.231
Shit. Just my luck.

23:21.775 --> 23:23.693
Just calm down. Stay calm, man.

23:26.321 --> 23:30.367
Look, they can't search the vehicle.
We ain't did shit wrong, chill out.

23:31.201 --> 23:32.828
Have you forgot you in Philly?

23:34.413 --> 23:36.331
Keep your hands where I can see 'em.

23:41.628 --> 23:43.046
What are you doing, sir?

23:43.130 --> 23:46.049
You got the street blocked off.
I was just backing up.

23:46.133 --> 23:47.551
Backing up, huh?

23:49.136 --> 23:50.637
Hey, what's wrong with this picture?

23:50.720 --> 23:54.474
Black van, tinted windows,
creeping through drug territory.

23:54.558 --> 23:55.976
They buying or selling?

23:56.059 --> 23:58.562
Yo, take that fucking hoodie down.

24:00.730 --> 24:02.315
My bad, officer. I'm sorry.

24:02.399 --> 24:03.358
Kelvin!

24:04.234 --> 24:07.195
What are you guys doing?
Uh… looking for hookers, drugs?

24:07.279 --> 24:08.864
We can't drive through Philly?

24:10.991 --> 24:12.451
Gentlemen, step out.

24:26.339 --> 24:28.300
Move to the front of the vehicle.

24:35.724 --> 24:38.143
And take some pictures
with your biggest fucking fans!

24:39.519 --> 24:41.646
-Look.
-The Kid is in the fucking house, man!

24:42.522 --> 24:44.900
I thought these guys were dirty,
hit 'em with the flashlight.

24:44.983 --> 24:48.028
-It's fucking him!
-I'm your biggest fan, man.

24:48.111 --> 24:51.406
Much appreciated, man.
This one here's being an asshole.

24:51.490 --> 24:53.783
-Scared my brother for an autograph.
-No, no, man.

24:53.867 --> 24:55.952
I would've gave you the fucking autograph.

24:56.036 --> 24:58.497
I'll take a picture
with everybody else but him.

24:58.580 --> 25:00.499
With this awkward-shaped head ass here.

25:00.582 --> 25:03.293
Hey, how lucky are you?
Kid is your brother?

25:03.376 --> 25:05.212
I bet you laugh all the time, huh?

25:05.795 --> 25:07.797
Hey, Kid, Brewer's a good guy, man.

25:07.881 --> 25:10.175
-Get the fuck. Brewer ain't no good guy!
-He's a good guy.

25:10.258 --> 25:11.885
-Not with that fucking head.
-Come on.

25:11.968 --> 25:13.970
-That head and that mustache.
-Come on.

25:14.054 --> 25:16.473
How much cocaine
you got in that fucking car right now?

25:16.556 --> 25:19.100
-You got a shitload of cocaine.
-No, no, we don't do that.

25:19.184 --> 25:21.853
I'm fucking with you.
Y'all ain't dirty cops.

25:21.937 --> 25:24.022
-Unless you are. Are y'all?
-Nah, man. Hell no.

25:24.105 --> 25:26.024
-Okay.
-Kid's brother. Take this.

25:26.733 --> 25:28.443
Take our picture?

25:28.527 --> 25:29.903
-Come on, C.
-Fucking A, man.

25:29.986 --> 25:31.363
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Come on, guys.

25:31.488 --> 25:33.532
I can't take no picture
with them in the background.

25:33.615 --> 25:36.076
-Let them go.
-Yo. Yo! Split. Get out of here!

25:36.159 --> 25:38.495
No, hey, no, come get in the picture!

25:39.037 --> 25:42.165
Come on.
Come get in the picture with me. Yeah.

25:43.041 --> 25:45.293
Come on, C. Take this one. Come on.

25:45.377 --> 25:47.879
Let's take a shot.
On three everyone say, "hammerhead."

25:47.963 --> 25:50.715
-One, two, three.
-Hammerhead!

25:50.799 --> 25:52.884
Fucking A, man.

25:52.968 --> 25:55.178
-Thanks, man.
-My man. Appreciate it, man.

26:03.728 --> 26:05.522
I forget how many people know you.

26:06.982 --> 26:08.692
That happens a lot, don't it?

26:11.152 --> 26:12.070
Yeah.

26:13.321 --> 26:16.533
I mean, I don't normally have
dead bodies in the truck, but…

26:16.616 --> 26:19.703
That's because you don't spend
enough time with your big bro.

26:20.328 --> 26:21.371
My big bro.

26:24.916 --> 26:27.127
I just wanna tell you I appreciate you, C.

26:28.378 --> 26:31.631
I know you got a record, but you still
came and took this ride with me.

26:31.715 --> 26:33.883
I'd do anything for my kid brother.

26:36.678 --> 26:39.931
I gotta give it to you, you get
pulled over, you got a body in the back,

26:40.015 --> 26:42.309
and you turn that shit
into a stand-up routine.

26:43.310 --> 26:45.729
-"You can't get in the picture!"
-His big-ass head.

26:45.812 --> 26:47.480
You can act, man.

27:38.865 --> 27:40.033
All right. Go. Go.

27:43.620 --> 27:44.746
Greedy bastard.

27:46.706 --> 27:48.333
Come on. Let's get the fuck out of here.

27:48.416 --> 27:49.417
-Yeah.
-Let's go.

28:01.846 --> 28:02.681
Hey, C.

28:02.764 --> 28:06.601
Remember, uh, that Dominican family
that had the bodega on the Hill?

28:07.227 --> 28:08.812
What was their daughter's name?

28:12.023 --> 28:13.983
-Dialysis.
-Dialysis!

28:14.609 --> 28:17.404
How the fuck you forget a name
like Dialysis? Goddamn.

28:18.154 --> 28:19.906
Everybody wanted the number, but I got it.

28:20.824 --> 28:23.868
-You never called her.
-I damn sure didn't. I was scared as hell.

28:24.661 --> 28:26.246
How do you know I didn't call her?

28:28.039 --> 28:29.457
I smashed her moms.

28:29.999 --> 28:31.209
You smashed her mom?

28:31.835 --> 28:32.752
Yeah.

28:33.336 --> 28:35.630
What? She was grown. We was kids.

28:35.714 --> 28:37.090
Seventeen years older.

28:39.801 --> 28:41.094
Yeah, she wanted it.

28:42.929 --> 28:43.763
Ah…

28:43.847 --> 28:45.515
But that booty was fire though.

28:45.598 --> 28:47.142
-I bet it was.
-It was good.

28:47.225 --> 28:48.309
I bet it was fire.

28:48.393 --> 28:50.687
-"Ai-yai-yai."

28:54.566 --> 28:55.608
Hey, pull over.

28:56.443 --> 28:58.278
-Pull over?
-Yeah, pull over.

29:00.989 --> 29:01.948
What's up, bro?

29:02.031 --> 29:04.534
-You know where we at?
-Pull over.

29:06.494 --> 29:08.371
-Right here.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

29:13.793 --> 29:15.462
They had me against the gate, bro.

29:16.212 --> 29:18.089
Y'all still out here
in these streets, huh?

29:19.048 --> 29:21.926
Y'all ain't gonna be satisfied
'till the cops come back again.

29:22.010 --> 29:25.096
We ain't got shit to do but be here.
What you doing out here?

29:25.180 --> 29:26.848
What do you mean? I'm from here.

29:26.931 --> 29:29.267
These my stomping grounds,
y'all do know, don't you?

29:29.350 --> 29:30.393
-Okay.
-My city.

29:30.477 --> 29:33.104
-This your city?
-Yes, this is my city. Absolutely.

29:33.188 --> 29:34.689
You hear this man?

29:34.773 --> 29:36.149
-That's crazy, man.
-Yo!

29:38.777 --> 29:40.820
"Hey, Carlton,
where was you at last night?"

29:40.904 --> 29:43.823
"Oh, me and Kid stopped
in the old neighborhood."

29:43.907 --> 29:45.450
"We hooped with some kids."

29:45.533 --> 29:47.827
We're putting our story together.
Follow me. Come on.

29:47.911 --> 29:49.871
Y'all take a picture
with them cops,

29:49.954 --> 29:52.540
-why don't y'all take a picture with us?
-Come on, say less.

29:52.624 --> 29:53.917
One time. Get in here.

29:54.417 --> 29:56.419
-Make sure you post it, though.
-I got you.

29:56.503 --> 29:58.379
Matter of fact, tag me,
and I'll repost it.

29:58.463 --> 29:59.380
Bet. I got you.

29:59.464 --> 30:01.883
I'll send some followers your way.
Y'all talking or hooping?

30:01.966 --> 30:03.051
-We hooping.
-We hooping?

30:03.134 --> 30:05.178
-Let's play. Two on two?
-Yeah, let's get it.

30:05.261 --> 30:06.971
Me and my brother against y'all.
Come on, C!.

30:07.055 --> 30:08.640
Let's bust their ass real quick.

30:08.723 --> 30:10.642
-That ain't happening.
-Shit.

30:10.725 --> 30:11.976
-Shit.
-Come on.

30:12.060 --> 30:12.894

30:12.977 --> 30:14.062
Twenty-one, by one.

30:14.604 --> 30:15.563
Ah. Ah.

30:15.647 --> 30:17.315
Ooh, hoo, hoo, hoo!

30:17.398 --> 30:18.316
