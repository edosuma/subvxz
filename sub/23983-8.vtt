Congratulations? On the gym
finally turning a profit?

00:05.246 --> 00:06.945
I'm stoked,
but we can't afford balloons.

00:06.947 --> 00:08.708
Whereas I'm confident
enough in our finances

00:08.718 --> 00:10.950
to finally stop using
both sides of the paper towel.

00:10.960 --> 00:12.985
Actually, the banner
and balloons are for me.

00:12.987 --> 00:14.887
My mom sent them.

00:14.889 --> 00:17.089
They're doing the musical
I wrote for the freshman show.

00:17.091 --> 00:19.158
Whoa, all right, that's amazing!

00:19.168 --> 00:21.176
Hey, if you need any help with lyrics,

00:21.186 --> 00:22.453

00:22.463 --> 00:25.022

the Whipped Cream Crew.

00:25.032 --> 00:26.824
Anyway, when is it?

00:26.834 --> 00:29.326
TBD. Technically, my show
hasn't been chosen yet,

00:29.336 --> 00:31.228
but this is a mere formality.

00:31.238 --> 00:33.564
I mean, it's between me
and some girl named Sandra.

00:33.574 --> 00:36.000
Oh, so you might be getting
your musical made.

00:36.010 --> 00:37.868
I will delete this text
to M.C. Mayonnaise.

Send the text. With slam effect.

"Who Evan Hansen?"

your hopes up just a little high?

00:52.171 --> 00:54.818
A little high? My hopes live
in a castle on a cloud.

My mother has told me
I'm amazing since the day

00:56.730 --> 00:58.722
I was born, and I refuse
to believe otherwise.

00:58.732 --> 01:01.258

talented, I won't live in a world

vanity plates reading MLB-MVP

I'm sorry.

17:58.376 --> 18:02.743
What? Are you kiddin' me?
That jackoff is cheatin'?

18:02.754 --> 18:05.673
Oh, I feel sick.
Give me a glass of water.

18:05.684 --> 18:08.017
Wow, you really worked
to beat back that accent, huh?

18:08.019 --> 18:09.752
You know, I... I just had

18:09.754 --> 18:12.055
so many dreams for our life together.

18:12.991 --> 18:14.324
Now, I'm gonna die alone.

18:14.326 --> 18:16.059
Look, until a few minutes ago,

18:16.061 --> 18:18.795
I would have said, "yeah, probably."

18:18.797 --> 18:20.797
But, I've learned that
sometimes you've got to hold

18:20.799 --> 18:24.100
onto a dream, no matter how implausible.

18:24.102 --> 18:26.002
You will find a boyfriend.

18:26.004 --> 18:28.847
Okay. Spoken like a man who will
remain fertile until the day he dies.

18:28.858 --> 18:31.871
Which could be today
if he doesn't stop talking.

18:35.707 --> 18:38.014
Your daddy's a jagoff.

18:39.979 --> 18:45.050
Hey. Been thinking about
what you said and you're right.

18:45.061 --> 18:47.089
How you should stop calling
yourself the "V-Card?"

18:47.100 --> 18:50.623
No, that nickname is bona
fide and it's gonna stay, okay?

18:50.634 --> 18:52.680
You were right about how
I shouldn't be telling you

18:52.691 --> 18:54.530
how to live your life.

18:54.532 --> 18:58.635
That being said, if you quit
this play, I'm kicking you out.

18:58.637 --> 19:00.970
What? No. I already made a scene.

19:00.972 --> 19:03.432
I can't go back on that. People
won't respect my tantrums.

19:03.450 --> 19:06.136
Yes, I know. This means your life
will briefly not be perfect.

19:06.147 --> 19:08.800
But you are a Cook. Cooks don't quit.

19:09.292 --> 19:11.042
Okay, starting today, Cook's don't quit.

19:11.053 --> 19:13.604
Well, I'm also a Patel.
And Mom quits all the time.

19:13.615 --> 19:15.451
She's been to, like,
the first ten minutes

19:15.453 --> 19:16.846
of every yoga class in Cleveland.

19:16.857 --> 19:18.057
All right.

19:18.370 --> 19:22.272
You haven't been gone that
long, so just enter quietly.

19:22.274 --> 19:27.471
Apologize, be humble,
and get back to work.

19:30.764 --> 19:33.098
Your savior has returned,
you talentless hacks.

19:33.109 --> 19:34.642
Commence your groveling.

19:34.644 --> 19:36.911
You've only missed one rehearsal.

19:36.913 --> 19:38.426
They thought you were in the bathroom.

19:38.437 --> 19:40.981
Michael. Thank god you're here.

19:40.983 --> 19:42.155
You're a genius.

19:42.166 --> 19:45.352
Reading your work has made me
realize that I've wasted my life

19:45.354 --> 19:47.054
as America's best young male harpist.

19:47.056 --> 19:49.223
Wow. Maybe my true calling isn't acting,

19:49.225 --> 19:51.191
but being an amazing writer-director.

19:51.193 --> 19:56.063
Well, direct me. I am but
a vessel. You are the wine.

19:56.065 --> 19:59.066
Thanks, but leave the metaphors to me.

19:59.902 --> 20:01.335
All right, everybody.

20:01.337 --> 20:03.070
Step one, I'm gonna need you

20:03.072 --> 20:05.139
to forget everything
you've ever learned.

20:05.141 --> 20:06.507
Absolutely not.

20:06.509 --> 20:10.411
- You all have finals coming up.
- Okay.

20:10.413 --> 20:13.380
Let's take it from the top.

20:13.382 --> 20:14.430
Hey, Matthew.

20:14.441 --> 20:16.850
I've tracked down
our old friend, Mr. Clarke.

20:16.852 --> 20:18.352
I told him that the drama was part

20:18.354 --> 20:19.781
of the Champions experience,

20:19.792 --> 20:21.956
like a "Housewives" reunion special.

20:21.958 --> 20:24.059
Do you want me to get out
of here so you can help him

20:24.070 --> 20:26.527
- do the sign-up paperwork?
- No, I want you to do it.

20:26.529 --> 20:29.229
It is a tedious, yet
legitimately important job

20:29.231 --> 20:33.033
that I now pass on to you.

20:33.035 --> 20:34.468
Plus, I got to focus on hiring

20:34.470 --> 20:37.371
a few more instructors
before Brittany dies.

20:37.373 --> 20:40.130
Really, I mean, are you sure?
What if I make a mistake

20:40.141 --> 20:42.209
and accidentally sign
Mr. Clarke up for the Taliban?

20:42.211 --> 20:45.763
- What did you say?
- Definitely don't do that.

20:45.774 --> 20:47.115
But, I trust you.

20:47.126 --> 20:49.624
And I'm sorry I blamed you
for letting Kombucha out.

20:49.635 --> 20:51.409
Oh, no, I totally let that dog get away.

20:51.420 --> 20:52.701
He peed all over your office.

20:52.712 --> 20:54.388
Have a seat, Mr. Clarke.

20:56.209 --> 20:57.449
Care for a Cheeto?

20:57.460 --> 21:00.122
- No, thank you.
- You passed the test.

21:00.133 --> 21:02.900
I think this is the start
of a beautiful membership.

21:02.911 --> 21:05.779
- Mother's maiden name?
- Vicenda Cordona de Casillas.

21:05.790 --> 21:07.923
And that's spelled just as it sounds?
