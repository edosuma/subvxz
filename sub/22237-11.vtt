WEBVTT

00:06.554 --> 00:10.887
Ten years ago, you cast a spell to get
me magic and you got stuck... nowhere!

00:10.893 --> 00:13.192
It would be different this time -
I know how to do it.

00:13.198 --> 00:15.642
If I said yes, how would it work?

00:15.743 --> 00:18.604
Ley lines are invisible lines
around the world of...

00:18.610 --> 00:20.586
Of mystical significance. Exactly.

00:20.604 --> 00:22.607
They all disappeared
along this ley line.

00:22.608 --> 00:25.599
Roland saw Oscar running.
He knows about magic!

00:25.600 --> 00:27.985
We need help with
a memory-wiping spell.

00:28.004 --> 00:29.591
You gave them my tablet.

00:29.592 --> 00:31.639
You can't risk Roland
asking more questions.

00:31.640 --> 00:34.199
And what if the kids
do more than wipe his memory?

00:34.205 --> 00:37.589
- Erase and quell forever!
- Sam, get out of the circle!

00:37.600 --> 00:39.356
Oh! Oh, oh!

00:46.218 --> 00:48.632
Hey. Dudes!

Season 2, Episode 11

01:35.505 --> 01:38.505
Synced by Reef

01:42.117 --> 01:46.671
- Are you OK?
- No. I don't know.

01:47.239 --> 01:51.164
That was intense. Why didn't you
tell me doing magic was so full-on?

01:51.170 --> 01:53.488
- Did the spell affect you?
- What spell?

01:53.494 --> 01:56.179
Why would Roland have
all this stuff about ley lines?

01:56.185 --> 01:58.203
All of you - stop.

01:58.240 --> 02:00.547
Tell me exactly what is going on.

02:00.553 --> 02:01.673
Oi!

02:04.114 --> 02:05.968
Deed is done - give it back.

02:10.645 --> 02:13.660
- What are you doing here?
- This is a one-time-only deal.

02:13.692 --> 02:16.746
<i>- (Echoes) What are you doing here?
- This is a one-time-only deal.</i>

02:16.752 --> 02:19.083
- You can't give it to Alice.
- I have to - it's hers.

02:19.089 --> 02:22.157
- She'll used it to stop...
- She made me promise.

02:23.918 --> 02:27.202
No. No, no, no, no, no -
wh-what have you done?

02:27.208 --> 02:30.076
- Are you sure the spell worked?
- Just the way we planned.

02:30.082 --> 02:33.517
- What did you do? How did you do this?
- Calm down. It's OK.

02:33.523 --> 02:37.117
- Do you remember the spell?
- What spell? What are you talking about?

02:37.559 --> 02:42.703
- I think you got too close to Roland.
- Roland...? What are you talking about?

02:42.709 --> 02:45.039
I think we wiped your memory too.

02:46.084 --> 02:48.571
Come on; we need to find
a way to fix this.

02:56.743 --> 02:59.202
What? Hairy fingers...?

02:59.425 --> 03:02.140
Dad's shoes...?
Oh, no.

03:02.141 --> 03:05.529
Roland Victor Murphy,
date of birth, 1969!

03:05.567 --> 03:08.173
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no...

03:10.011 --> 03:13.718
Ahh! Oh! Oh!

03:15.878 --> 03:18.599
You are so old...!

03:18.719 --> 03:22.022
- Could we get the tablet back?
- You heard Phoebe - I don't think so.

03:22.028 --> 03:24.441
But we can't reverse the spell
without it.

03:25.552 --> 03:28.359
JAKE: Couldn't we just tell Sam
what he needs to know?

03:28.365 --> 03:29.878
Fill in the blanks...?

03:31.898 --> 03:35.445
Hey, where is Sam?

03:35.744 --> 03:37.696
(Phone rings)

03:38.064 --> 03:40.515
- Roberts.
- Roberts, you have to help me.

03:40.521 --> 03:43.675
- Who is this?
- It's me, Detective Sergeant Murphy.

03:43.681 --> 03:44.998
Sam!

03:45.038 --> 03:48.608
Prank-calling the police station might not
be the smartest thing to do, young man.

03:48.614 --> 03:51.878
I'm not. I'm... They think I'm...

03:52.413 --> 03:54.088
Hang on a minute.

03:54.663 --> 03:57.128
Long story short,
this is an opportunity.

03:58.207 --> 03:59.858
Are you alright?

04:01.227 --> 04:02.832
Um...

04:03.151 --> 04:08.139
I don't know.
Why don't you tell me... "guys"...?

04:09.868 --> 04:11.280
"Dudes"...?

04:13.141 --> 04:15.041
SAM AS ROLAND: Felix!

04:20.720 --> 04:25.205
Felix! (Echoes)
Seriously, dude! (Echoes)

04:30.176 --> 04:32.518
This is so not funny!

04:35.081 --> 04:36.712
Felix...?

04:37.669 --> 04:39.657
So what's the last thing
you remember?

04:43.481 --> 04:46.218
The party - Andy running off.

04:46.362 --> 04:49.979
- You don't remember anything after that?
- Not a thing.

04:49.985 --> 04:52.636
You remember the alternate
universe, though, right?

04:53.082 --> 04:55.293
I could use a précis.

04:55.929 --> 04:59.014
- "Précis"...?
- It means 'recap'.

04:59.239 --> 05:02.375
I know what it means.
Since when does Sam?

05:03.515 --> 05:09.257
Er, dudes, I have a dictionary.
On my phone.

05:11.494 --> 05:15.553
Anyway, back to the alternate
universe stuff you mentioned.

05:15.660 --> 05:21.400
- Guys, tell me more about that.
- You remember the school excursion?

05:24.221 --> 05:26.670
(Knocks and whispers loudly) Felix!

05:29.046 --> 05:30.284
(Knocks again)

05:30.290 --> 05:33.115
- Felix!
- Can I ask what you're doing?

05:33.116 --> 05:35.844
Oh. Mrs Ferne. Hi.

05:35.850 --> 05:38.877
- Haven't you harassed my son enough?
- No...?!

05:39.176 --> 05:41.320
I'd appreciate it if you left now.

05:41.321 --> 05:42.753
Um...

05:42.831 --> 05:48.365
If you see Felix,
can you tell him I said hi?

05:48.848 --> 05:51.328
And that I need to see him.

05:52.594 --> 05:54.956
It's... super-urgent.

05:55.101 --> 05:59.091
You look ridiculous, by the way.
The baseball cap.

05:59.242 --> 06:00.460
Oh.

06:00.472 --> 06:02.779
Who do you think you are -
the hip-hop police?

06:03.212 --> 06:05.038
Oh! (Laughs)

06:09.921 --> 06:12.754
- Hey, watch it!
- Oh, sorry, Detective.

06:12.788 --> 06:14.116
"Detective"...?

06:14.291 --> 06:17.895
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Right.
That's me - detective.

06:18.092 --> 06:19.587
Oi!

06:20.084 --> 06:21.760
Stop right there.

06:21.848 --> 06:23.630
Er, yes?

06:23.776 --> 06:26.286
Are we doing something
wrong, Detective?

06:26.873 --> 06:29.937
- Yes, you are, Mia.
- Such as...?

06:30.564 --> 06:34.236
- Well, you... you know.
- No. I don't.

06:34.997 --> 06:38.664
Well, you could do so much
better than this... clown.

06:40.573 --> 06:42.333
Gimme your skateboard.

06:42.420 --> 06:44.907
- W-why?
- I'm confiscating it.

06:44.913 --> 06:47.847
- Why?
- Hey - you want a fine too?

06:47.893 --> 06:50.585
Yeah - I can fine you;
I'm a detective.

06:50.591 --> 06:53.126
- No, I just...
- Maybe a little jail time?

06:53.132 --> 06:56.089
- For what?
- Just try me.

06:59.156 --> 07:00.549
And the helmet.

07:03.883 --> 07:05.093
Good.

07:05.736 --> 07:07.691
Now get outta here.

07:08.947 --> 07:10.206
Mia?

07:12.413 --> 07:14.559
You know I'm right, Mia.

07:23.577 --> 07:25.532
What was that all about?

07:25.583 --> 07:30.118
So maybe Andy's in another universe
with dinosaurs, or something?

07:30.124 --> 07:33.194
Without a talisman we have
no way of contacting him again.

07:33.200 --> 07:38.054
Right. Talisman.
Where did that come from again?

07:38.060 --> 07:42.559
The other universe. It was Alice's.
She doesn't have one here.

07:44.895 --> 07:48.969
- Which she should, shouldn't she?
- There were two necklaces.

07:49.039 --> 07:51.286
- Two versions of you.
- And two Garys.

07:51.292 --> 07:53.916
- I-I'm confused.
- He's back!

07:54.400 --> 07:58.102
But Alice doesn't have a talisman here -
that's why she was after yours.

07:58.108 --> 08:01.091
Which means, for some reason,
she never had it here!

08:01.097 --> 08:03.642
- And we could still find it.
- A second talisman...

08:03.648 --> 08:06.428
If there is a second talisman,
where would we find it?

08:06.434 --> 08:10.398
- Could be anywhere.
- Good thing we have Oscar.

08:10.704 --> 08:12.165
Oscar.

08:17.363 --> 08:18.613
Ahem.

08:21.913 --> 08:23.494
Oh...!

08:23.500 --> 08:25.447
Detective Sergeant Murphy...

08:25.453 --> 08:28.862
So, instead of looking for Andy Lau,
you're learning to skateboard?

08:28.868 --> 08:32.086
No! I already know how to skateboard.

08:34.559 --> 08:38.626
What do you say to the accusations that
your investigation has been incompetent?

08:38.631 --> 08:40.464
Oh, um...

08:42.092 --> 08:45.651
- Sorry.
- That's not an answer.

08:45.657 --> 08:47.709
- Sorr... Yes, it is.
- Hey, what are you doing?

08:47.715 --> 08:49.192
- What?
- What are you doing?

08:49.198 --> 08:51.790
- You're in shot, Sergeant.
- Yeah, and you're out of line.

08:51.796 --> 08:53.799
We're doing everything we can
to find Andy Lau.

08:53.805 --> 08:55.891
Yeah, yeah, yeah -
yeah, you tell her, Sarge.

08:55.897 --> 08:58.952
Really? So what progress
have you made?

08:59.199 --> 09:00.999
- Well...
- Hm?

09:02.552 --> 09:07.811
Well, yeah, for your information, we are,
like, this close to getting Andy back.

09:09.128 --> 09:10.451
You are?

09:10.457 --> 09:12.151
- We are...?
- Yeah - aren't we?

09:13.666 --> 09:15.391
Mm.

09:18.094 --> 09:21.518
Are you keeping information from
the public, from the Lau family?

09:21.524 --> 09:22.397
(Chuckles)

09:22.403 --> 09:24.179
Do you know where Andy Lau is?

09:24.185 --> 09:27.662
- Oh, now, I never said that I...
- You said that you were this close.

09:27.719 --> 09:31.889
- What did you mean?
- Yeah - what did you mean?

09:31.987 --> 09:33.481
What did I mean...?

09:33.487 --> 09:39.867
What I meant is that
being a detective is not easy.

09:40.100 --> 09:45.382
I got hair growing outta my ears and...
and my back hurts - for no reason.

09:45.415 --> 09:50.196
And what I... what I need now
is just to talk to Felix.

09:50.432 --> 09:51.959
OK?

09:52.837 --> 09:55.617
So if that's, er...
if that's everything...

09:56.635 --> 09:58.380
Thank you very much.

09:59.428 --> 10:00.953
(Slams the door)

10:19.699 --> 10:21.051
Dudes...!

10:21.064 --> 10:23.589
So, according to this,
it's all to do with the ley lines -

10:23.595 --> 10:26.659
the disappearances in the forest,
the strange events, the magic...

10:26.694 --> 10:29.125
Where are these ley lines?
I've never seen any.

10:29.140 --> 10:32.786
They're kind of like the Equator.
You can't see that either.

10:32.792 --> 10:34.762
(Phone rings)

10:34.768 --> 10:37.688
- Who is it?
- No idea.

10:40.968 --> 10:44.118
<i>Hey. This is Felix. Speak now
or forever hold your peace.</i>

10:44.406 --> 10:48.479
Come on, Felix!
I can't be Roland forever.

10:50.798 --> 10:52.781
(Phone rings)

10:52.944 --> 10:54.282
Station...?

10:55.408 --> 10:56.705
Hello?

10:57.218 --> 10:59.634
Are you... me?

10:59.640 --> 11:02.718
- What are you doing at the station?
- Just put Felix on.

11:02.797 --> 11:04.228
Do not open your mouth.

11:04.229 --> 11:05.448
Oops.

11:05.454 --> 11:07.761
- Too late.
- What do you mean?

11:08.420 --> 11:10.903
I only saved your bacon
with that reporter chick.

11:10.909 --> 11:15.441
- You talked to the press?!
- Chillax, dude. I totally rocked it.

11:15.447 --> 11:18.121
I highly doubt you rocked anything.

11:18.127 --> 11:22.094
Whatever. Just tell Felix he needs
to change us back, like, now.

11:22.100 --> 11:23.397
Are you coming?

11:27.230 --> 11:29.384
Stay right where you are.
Don't move.

11:32.530 --> 11:35.514
(Stomach rumbles)

11:40.761 --> 11:42.128
Oh.

11:42.189 --> 11:45.233
Oh, I'm starved. See ya.

11:51.367 --> 11:54.801
- I have to go. Later, gang. Yo.
- What did you just say?

11:54.807 --> 11:57.131
FELIX: We're looking for
the talisman - we need you.

11:57.174 --> 12:00.094
Er, yes. Of course. Right.

12:00.132 --> 12:03.163
Just, er...
I've just got an errand to run.

12:03.185 --> 12:06.656
- Errand...?
- Is this about Mia? Now's not the time.

12:06.662 --> 12:09.527
Er, yes. Mia. Exactly.

12:10.071 --> 12:11.693
- I won't be long.
- Sam!

12:11.699 --> 12:14.925
- Chillax, dudes - totally rocking this.
- What...?

12:15.706 --> 12:18.141
Meet back at my place!

12:18.884 --> 12:21.425
What did you put in that spell?

12:27.243 --> 12:30.198
You! Stay away from me.

12:30.204 --> 12:32.923
- What?
- I know what you're capable of.

12:33.203 --> 12:35.593
- What's wrong with you?
- What's wrong with me?

12:35.599 --> 12:39.522
- As if you don't know.
- Er, I don't. (Laughs)

12:39.782 --> 12:44.758
When this is all over, you will be
needing your lawyer, Miss Hartley.

12:51.365 --> 12:53.662
Well, I'll need something
connected to the talisman.

12:53.668 --> 12:56.382
We don't have anything.
Can you just try anyway?

12:56.388 --> 12:57.945
It's worth a shot, right?

12:57.951 --> 12:59.051
(Scoffs)

13:06.917 --> 13:08.893
(Laughs nervously)

13:16.258 --> 13:19.313
- No pressure!
- I can't do it with all you watching.

13:19.319 --> 13:21.805
OK. We'll be over here.

13:29.148 --> 13:31.442
Why are you always
looking at that stuff?

13:31.528 --> 13:34.505
Ley lines are lines
of powerful magic.

13:34.618 --> 13:38.068
The places where they intersect
are the most powerful of all.

13:47.645 --> 13:49.250
What is it, Osky?

13:49.783 --> 13:52.730
Sorry. All I've done
is draw the talisman again.

13:56.664 --> 14:00.434
The lines on the talisman! They're
the same pattern as the ley lines.

14:00.440 --> 14:03.462
- What does that mean?
- Hang on. Let me try something.

14:11.683 --> 14:14.126
The talisman and the ley lines
are connected.

14:14.132 --> 14:18.092
- How?
- All we have to do is line them up.

14:19.502 --> 14:21.094
They're a map.

14:21.594 --> 14:23.057
That's the altar in the forest.

14:23.063 --> 14:25.310
That's what made the unmaking spell
work that first time.

14:25.316 --> 14:27.862
- That's the school.
- And what's this one?

14:30.032 --> 14:33.939
Dudes - skating here took forever.

14:34.108 --> 14:36.100
(Pants)

14:38.874 --> 14:41.438
- Roberts, where's Murphy?
- Excuse me...?

14:41.444 --> 14:42.789
I need to see him now.

14:42.795 --> 14:46.430
First off, you need a lesson
in how to address a police officer.

14:46.436 --> 14:48.286
Get over it, Roberts.
This is an emergency.

14:48.292 --> 14:51.865
- What sort of emergency, exactly?
- I am Murphy.

14:51.935 --> 14:54.552
I mean I'm Murphy
stuck in this kid's body.

14:54.558 --> 14:56.991
- That was you on the phone...
- That's what I'm trying to tell you.

14:56.997 --> 15:00.666
- Pretending to be Detective Murphy.
- I'm not pretending. I...

15:00.672 --> 15:04.216
Look, long story short,
is he here or not?

15:04.222 --> 15:06.706
- Why do you keep saying that?
- Saying what?

15:06.712 --> 15:09.303
It's annoying enough
when Detective Murphy says it.

15:09.478 --> 15:10.933
It is?

15:11.128 --> 15:15.108
Take a seat. I'll make a call.

15:21.232 --> 15:24.876
Dudes, I am telling you - I'm Sam!

15:24.954 --> 15:30.579
Inside this saggy, wrinkly,
really unbelievably gross body,

15:30.585 --> 15:32.560
I am Sam!

15:32.593 --> 15:34.913
- Prove it.
- Ask me anything.

15:35.004 --> 15:37.337
Something only Sam would know.

15:37.349 --> 15:40.193
- What does Sam know?!
- I know plenty!

15:40.199 --> 15:42.218
I know that when we were
in the other universe,

15:42.224 --> 15:46.868
your mum was married to Bates, you were
in love with Andy and you refused to wash.

15:47.383 --> 15:52.658
- So we didn't erase your memory?
- No! You swapped us!

15:53.072 --> 15:56.640
- This is not good.
- Oh, finally!

15:58.569 --> 16:02.633
If you're Sam - and Sam is Roland,

16:02.802 --> 16:05.485
then we just told
Roland everything.

16:05.491 --> 16:06.717
Thanks.

16:08.728 --> 16:11.727
Your mum is coming to get you
as soon as she can.

16:11.733 --> 16:13.145
My mum...?

16:15.429 --> 16:18.385
Roberts, this is ridiculous -
I'm a grown man.

16:18.403 --> 16:20.932
I thought I knew everything
when I was your age too.

16:20.938 --> 16:22.925
I'm older than you!

16:23.100 --> 16:26.930
What happened to you boys
when you went missing?

16:27.361 --> 16:29.331
Is that what's causing all of this?

16:29.388 --> 16:32.447
That is what I am
this close to finding out.

16:36.513 --> 16:38.488
(Alarm sounds)

16:38.494 --> 16:39.723
Wait here.

16:45.442 --> 16:47.254
Sam! I mean, Roland.

16:48.893 --> 16:51.050
Let's go now,
before Roberts comes back.

17:08.195 --> 17:09.839
This is...

17:10.939 --> 17:12.560
Weird...?

17:13.531 --> 17:17.165
This is freakier than when I saw
the alternate universe me.

17:19.092 --> 17:21.112
Why are you wearing
that stupid hat?

17:21.117 --> 17:22.019
(Laughs)

17:22.044 --> 17:23.269
'Cause it looks good.

17:23.275 --> 17:26.367
Everything we told you about magic
and what we can do...

17:26.373 --> 17:29.133
- Are you gonna tell people?
- Because if you do...

17:29.139 --> 17:32.749
We could make Roland here walk through
town with his underpants on his head.

17:32.755 --> 17:35.711
Yeah. I could do that.

17:36.179 --> 17:38.479
Then it's goodbye career.

17:41.104 --> 17:45.190
I won't tell - if you fix this.

17:46.599 --> 17:49.081
Yeah, we're working on that.

17:50.170 --> 17:54.141
The talisman is most likely
to be at a place of magical power.

17:54.192 --> 17:55.471
Detective!

17:55.477 --> 17:58.046
It's Viv.
Ellen, put the map away.

17:58.061 --> 18:00.809
- Yes, Vivian?
- Not you!

18:01.929 --> 18:04.589
- You're Roland.
- Oh, yeah. Um...

18:04.595 --> 18:08.408
- Hi, Viv.
- What are you doing here with them?

18:08.414 --> 18:11.288
- Well, I...
- You gave them my research?

18:11.294 --> 18:15.418
- No. No, it... It wasn't me.
- Why are you lying?

18:15.424 --> 18:18.057
- Viv, I...
- You, don't talk to me.

18:18.532 --> 18:20.943
I can't believe
you're on their side!

18:22.810 --> 18:24.853
We have to tell her the truth.

18:24.859 --> 18:28.533
If we get her brother back -
that'll be better than the truth.

18:35.522 --> 18:39.326
You know this is trespassing, right?
I'm an officer of the law.

18:39.332 --> 18:42.490
- Er, technically, I am.
- Either way.

18:42.496 --> 18:44.729
Do you want your bodies back
or don't you?

18:44.735 --> 18:47.475
- BOTH: Yes.
- Trespass it is.

18:49.832 --> 18:51.246
Bates!

18:53.564 --> 18:55.061
What's he doing here?

18:55.074 --> 18:57.575
Weekend science club -
it starts in an hour.

18:59.134 --> 19:02.640
I used to go - to meet girls.

19:06.276 --> 19:10.232
- Alright, let's check the plans.
- Great idea, dude.

19:11.874 --> 19:15.076
- Don't tell me you're BFFs now.
- So what are we looking for?

19:15.082 --> 19:19.906
I don't know, exactly. Hiding place for
the talisman. That tracing you made...

19:22.496 --> 19:24.052
Doesn't work.

19:27.124 --> 19:28.552
But this one might.

19:28.732 --> 19:30.655
___

19:30.787 --> 19:33.055
I will not ever get used to this...

19:33.061 --> 19:35.523
- What?
- Smart Sam.

19:35.529 --> 19:37.569
Standing right here.
(Laughs)

19:39.673 --> 19:41.089
Fits perfectly.

19:42.601 --> 19:46.632
Which makes the intersection
the... woodwork room.

19:46.765 --> 19:49.969
I spent two years in this room.
I never saw any talisman.

19:49.978 --> 19:53.370
Two years? You failed woodwork?

19:53.376 --> 19:55.379
Shelves are tricky.
(Laughs)

19:55.510 --> 19:57.494
Let's stay on task, shall we?

20:07.687 --> 20:11.527
If I were a talisman,
where would I hide?

20:11.878 --> 20:16.417
Is there anything that doesn't belong?
Anything out of place?

20:16.423 --> 20:19.100
Everything's out of place.
It's a mess.

20:19.106 --> 20:23.105
Check this. No-one used this thing,
not once in two years.

20:23.194 --> 20:26.288
- Don't even know what it does.
- It's a hand drill.

20:26.294 --> 20:30.254
- So why is it stuck to the wall?
- Try twisting it.

20:36.705 --> 20:38.226
Do it again.

20:47.341 --> 20:50.365
I'm so taking woodwork next year.

22:02.181 --> 22:07.462
Dust. Cobwebs... I don't think
anyone's been here for a while.

22:15.022 --> 22:17.704
These books are filled with magic
I've never even heard of.

22:17.710 --> 22:21.103
Hey - don't nerd out on me now, dude.

22:23.961 --> 22:27.000
Somebody at this school
was a very powerful witch.

22:27.825 --> 22:30.679
And they know about ley lines.

22:33.237 --> 22:36.213
Look all over. Could be anywhere.

22:41.723 --> 22:43.675
Is this meaningful?

22:45.732 --> 22:49.222
It's an altar. Same as the forest.

22:49.303 --> 22:52.637
___

22:57.392 --> 23:01.124
- Why here?
- Scrying pool doesn't lie.

23:02.612 --> 23:06.620
- What are they looking for?
- Another talisman.

23:06.626 --> 23:08.634
Isn't that a bad thing?

23:10.015 --> 23:14.357
No. It's an opportunity.

23:17.283 --> 23:19.283
Talisman is close.

23:20.550 --> 23:22.225
I can feel it.

23:34.297 --> 23:36.818
(Makes game show 'wrong' noise)

23:46.404 --> 23:49.407
- Dude!
- This is it.

23:50.464 --> 23:53.228
So we can swap back to our old bodies
with that thing?

23:53.234 --> 23:56.690
Yes! Goodbye floppy underarm pits.

23:56.696 --> 23:59.577
Listen, I'm a bit tired
of the old man gags.

23:59.583 --> 24:02.594
Hello! And I'm not tired
of being the old man?

24:02.600 --> 24:04.157
This has got to stop.

24:04.402 --> 24:06.615
First we have to activate it.

24:18.457 --> 24:23.377
Elements we call together,
erase and quell forever.

24:26.647 --> 24:31.153
Elements we call together,
erase and quell forever!

24:32.570 --> 24:34.833
Oh! Oh...

24:34.847 --> 24:35.941
(Chuckles)

24:35.947 --> 24:37.727
I'm me! (Laughs)

24:37.733 --> 24:41.931
And I am most certainly not you.
What have you been doing to me?

24:42.076 --> 24:43.553
(Stomach rumbles)

24:43.559 --> 24:46.929
I'm starving!
Didn't you feed me?

24:57.882 --> 25:00.826
Do you think we can use
the talisman to talk to Andy?

25:03.438 --> 25:05.398
With this altar...

25:07.702 --> 25:10.453
We might be able to bring him home.

25:10.921 --> 25:17.913
Elements in flux, elements unite,
elements in flux, elements unite.

25:22.787 --> 25:25.872
We need to find another tear so
we can find a way to get me home.

25:26.235 --> 25:28.905
- What's happening?!
- You did this.

25:29.684 --> 25:31.871
Can you slow Alice down,
get the cops onto her?

25:31.877 --> 25:33.103
Leave it with me.

25:36.232 --> 25:37.350
Hey!

25:37.362 --> 25:40.774
We use the altar to boost the communication
spell - it turns a window into a door.

25:40.780 --> 25:42.779
- That's brilliant.
- Do you guys feel that?

25:42.785 --> 25:45.489
- Alice knows about the second talisman.
- What's she doing?

25:45.495 --> 25:48.446
Trying to stop us from reaching
Andy, like she did last time.

25:49.089 --> 25:50.318
No!
