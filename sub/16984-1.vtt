WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:04.072
HEAVY BREATHING

00:17.720 --> 00:19.631
You know that feeling
when a guy you like

00:19.680 --> 00:21.640
sends you a text at
two o'clock on a Tuesday night

00:21.664 --> 00:23.551
asking if he can come and find you

00:23.600 --> 00:26.016
and you've accidentally made it out
like you've just got in yourself.

00:26.040 --> 00:28.216
So you have to get out of bed,
drink half a bottle of wine

00:28.240 --> 00:31.056
get in the shower, shave everything,
dig out some Agent Provocateur business

00:31.080 --> 00:32.308
suspender belt, the whole bit

00:32.360 --> 00:34.237
and wait by the door
until the buzzer goes?

00:34.280 --> 00:35.679
DOORBELL BUZZES

00:39.240 --> 00:42.400
And then you open the door to him like
you've almost forgotten he's coming over.

00:43.040 --> 00:45.395
Oh. Hi.

00:45.680 --> 00:47.000
Hey.

00:49.160 --> 00:50.195
Hey.

00:51.400 --> 00:52.595
Hey.

00:53.680 --> 00:55.717
And then you get to it immediately.

00:56.400 --> 00:58.437
L 3.E' L[(, I:1;'3-ill Lb;

01:06.160 --> 01:07.912
After some pretty standard bouncing

01:07.960 --> 01:13.353
you realise he's edging
towards your arsehole.

01:14.040 --> 01:17.510
But you're drunk and he made
the effort to come all the way here.

01:17.560 --> 01:19.915
So you let him. He's thrilled.

01:20.280 --> 01:21.429
Oh!

01:21.480 --> 01:23.232
I'm so thrilled.

01:28.280 --> 01:34.549
And then the next morning
you wake to find him fully dressed

01:34.600 --> 01:38.559
sat on the side of the bed,
gazing at you.

01:45.960 --> 01:48.031
He says that...
- Last night was incredible.

01:48.080 --> 01:50.151
Which you think is an overstatement.

01:50.200 --> 01:52.271
But then he goes on to say that...

01:52.320 --> 01:56.553
It was particularly special because
I've never managed to actually...

01:57.840 --> 02:00.753
up the burn with anyone before.

02:01.520 --> 02:03.238
To be fair he does have a large penis.

02:03.280 --> 02:05.351
And although it's always
been a fantasy of mine

02:05.400 --> 02:09.155
I've never found anyone
I could do it with.

02:10.080 --> 02:12.435
And then he touches your hair.

02:17.560 --> 02:19.995
And thanks you with a genuine earnest.

02:22.240 --> 02:23.753
Thank you.

02:25.160 --> 02:27.197
It's sort of moving.

02:27.240 --> 02:29.390
Then he kisses you gently...

02:36.120 --> 02:37.758
and then he leaves.

02:46.920 --> 02:50.231
And you spend the rest
of the day wondering...

02:53.120 --> 02:55.953
do I have a massive arsehole?

03:24.040 --> 03:25.792
BELL RINGS

03:33.080 --> 03:35.549
Well, um, this doesn't happen
very often, does it?

03:35.600 --> 03:37.477
THEY LAUGH
- No.

03:37.520 --> 03:39.636
No, I suppose it's...

03:39.680 --> 03:41.751
THEY LAUGH
- It's quite rare, yeah.

03:43.160 --> 03:44.514
I hate myself.

03:45.760 --> 03:47.592
Um, are you going to work?

03:47.640 --> 03:51.270
Er, no actually...
- Okay, um, this is gonna sound crazy

03:51.320 --> 03:53.357
um, but I think that I
should take your number

03:53.400 --> 03:54.720
and I think I should call it

03:54.760 --> 03:58.276
and I think I should ask you if you
wanna go out for a drink with me.

03:59.800 --> 04:01.154
Um...

04:01.200 --> 04:03.157
Fuck me, you've got a boyfriend.

04:03.200 --> 04:06.670
Er, no. Um, no, we broke up
quite recently actually.

04:06.720 --> 04:09.792
Oh my God, I'm so sorry,
slash really pleased.

04:09.840 --> 04:13.435
Um, how the hell did he
manage to fuck that up?

04:15.000 --> 04:16.637
Power rarely gives up without a fight.

04:17.880 --> 04:22.829
Particularly in places where there are
divisions of tribe, divisions of sect.

04:24.560 --> 04:27.916
We also know that populism
can take dangerous turns

04:27.960 --> 04:30.873
and there will be difficult
days along the way.

04:31.680 --> 04:36.072
From the extremism of those who would use
democracy to deny a minority of rights

04:37.080 --> 04:38.960
to the nationalism that...
- What are you doing?

04:38.984 --> 04:40.258
Nothing.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.559
Harry.

04:45.600 --> 04:48.319
I know what you were doing.
- I was watching the news.

04:49.680 --> 04:51.318
Really?
- Yeah.

04:52.640 --> 04:54.677
Really?
- Yeah.

04:55.720 --> 04:57.233
What was he talking about then?

04:57.280 --> 04:59.032
What?
- SHE LAUGHS

04:59.080 --> 05:01.754
Please, I just need to hear this.
What was he talking about?

05:04.240 --> 05:05.514
Iraq.

05:09.800 --> 05:14.033
Don't say anything,
and please don't stop me leaving.

05:15.200 --> 05:17.669
Please don't!
- Okay. - Don't!

05:21.160 --> 05:23.913
I've really tried to be
there for you through this.

05:23.960 --> 05:26.190
You can't say I haven't tried.

05:26.240 --> 05:27.560
Don't say anything.

05:27.600 --> 05:29.750
And please don't contact me

05:29.800 --> 05:32.076
or turn up at my house drunk
in your underwear.

05:32.120 --> 05:33.838
It won't work this time.
- It will.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.116
I'm taking that posh shampoo.

05:42.480 --> 05:43.914
He was talking about democ...

05:45.320 --> 05:47.038
Oh, he was just...

05:48.280 --> 05:51.750
really kind
and supportive with my work.

05:51.800 --> 05:54.440
He'd cook all the time,
he'd run baths, hoover.

05:54.480 --> 05:56.391
He'd laugh at all of my jokes.

05:56.440 --> 05:59.034
He was really great with my family
and my friends loved him.

05:59.080 --> 06:00.878
Plus he was really fucking affectionate.

06:00.920 --> 06:03.753
HE LAUGHS

06:06.400 --> 06:08.914
Yeah, he sounds like a dickhead.
- Yeah.

06:08.960 --> 06:12.430
So was that like you can have
my number or whatever you...

06:12.480 --> 06:14.994
Yes. Yeah, I guess it's a yes.

06:15.040 --> 06:17.475
Oh my God. Great. Okay.

06:19.360 --> 06:21.397
Put that in there.

06:23.600 --> 06:25.830
And I'll be sure to treat you
like a nasty little bitch.

06:27.840 --> 06:29.160
Um, that was a joke.

06:29.200 --> 06:31.840
Oh no, I know, I know.
- Yeah, okay. That was like, oh.

06:31.880 --> 06:33.951
Okay. Great. Wow.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.435
I'II buzz you then?

06:36.480 --> 06:38.835
Okay.
- Okay. Okay.

06:41.080 --> 06:44.038
I can't stop smiling. Sorry I...
- HE LAUGHS

06:44.840 --> 06:46.513
Oh, okay.

07:04.560 --> 07:06.676
Thank you for coming in today.

07:06.720 --> 07:12.398
We really appreciate you considering us
for your small business start-up loan.

07:12.440 --> 07:14.397
No problem.
- I've read your application form.

07:14.440 --> 07:17.239
Thank you.
- It <i>was... funny.</i>

07:17.280 --> 07:18.350
Oh.

07:19.400 --> 07:21.277
Okay, that wasn't my intention but...

07:21.320 --> 07:23.470
As you are probably aware

07:23.520 --> 07:26.433
we haven't had the opportunity
to support many...

07:26.480 --> 07:28.676
any women-led businesses since the...

07:28.720 --> 07:30.552
Sexual harassment case.

07:31.040 --> 07:34.032
The sexual harassment case, yes.

07:35.960 --> 07:37.871
Are you alright?
- Oh yeah, sorry.

07:37.920 --> 07:41.231
I just, um, I ran from the
station so I'm just a bit hot.

07:41.280 --> 07:42.759
But I'm really excited about, um...

07:42.800 --> 07:45.030
Water?
- er, no thanks, I'm fine.

07:45.080 --> 07:47.080
Actually, yeah,
water would be great, if I could...

07:47.104 --> 07:48.035
Sure.

07:48.080 --> 07:51.516
There are a couple of details
that we need to iron out

07:51.560 --> 07:54.996
and one or two bits and pieces
I'm gonna need to see some more on.

07:55.040 --> 07:58.476
It says in here that you opened
the business with your partner in...

08:00.320 --> 08:01.515
Okay.

08:02.360 --> 08:05.318
I'm sorry, that kind of thing
won't get you very far here anymore.

08:05.360 --> 08:06.555
Oh no, sorry.

08:06.600 --> 08:08.079
I thought I had a top on underneath.

08:08.120 --> 08:09.952
Yeah, okay.
- No seriously.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.354
In this case, genuine accident.

08:11.400 --> 08:13.640
I can see given our history
why you might think that's...

08:13.664 --> 08:15.790
No! Seriously I wasn't
trying to. I was hot.

08:15.840 --> 08:17.480
I take this kind of thing very seriously.

08:17.504 --> 08:19.939
I'm not trying to shag you!
Look at yourself!

08:25.760 --> 08:27.273
Okay.

08:28.440 --> 08:29.839
Please leave.

08:30.640 --> 08:31.914
On...

08:32.720 --> 08:36.030
No, you don't understand.
I need this... I need this loan...

08:36.080 --> 08:38.150
Please just leave.

08:50.880 --> 08:52.029
Perv!

08:53.200 --> 08:54.554
Wow!

09:06.040 --> 09:07.553
My sister.

09:07.600 --> 09:09.830
She's uptight and beautiful
and probably anorexic

09:09.880 --> 09:12.315
but clothes look awesome on her so...

09:12.360 --> 09:14.237
You're almost late.

09:14.280 --> 09:15.873
Had to do a flash poo in Pret.

09:15.920 --> 09:17.399
Oh Christ. Did you wash your hands?

09:17.440 --> 09:18.440
Course not.

09:19.240 --> 09:22.596
Oh my God! You are disgusting.
Fucking hell.

09:22.640 --> 09:25.951
Of course I washed my hands.
It's not like a grew up without a mother.

09:28.320 --> 09:29.640
Heard from dad?

09:29.680 --> 09:30.829
No.

09:32.440 --> 09:34.716
Dad's way of coping with
two motherless daughters

09:34.760 --> 09:36.592
was to buy us tickets to feminist lectures

09:36.640 --> 09:39.109
start fucking our Godmother
and eventually stop calling.

09:42.600 --> 09:43.954
You look tired.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.514
Thanks, I've been sleeping
really well recently.

09:53.040 --> 09:54.314
Shit.

09:56.080 --> 10:00.790
I'm wearing the top
that she lost years ago.

10:00.840 --> 10:03.719
So... this is gonna be tense.

10:04.160 --> 10:05.833
Do you want to take your coat off?

10:05.880 --> 10:07.791
- Okay.

10:10.760 --> 10:12.831
Oh, I'm so sorry.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.320
So, any luck with...

10:17.360 --> 10:18.976
Oh God, can we just have
two seconds without...

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
I was going to ask how
it was going with the cafe'.

10:21.024 --> 10:24.224
I know, I just don't wanna talk about it
yet! - Fine, we won't talk then. - Fine.

10:25.360 --> 10:27.829
Hair looks nice.
- Oh fuck off.

10:29.960 --> 10:33.749
The only thing harder than having
to tell your super-high-powered

10:33.800 --> 10:36.792
perfect, anorexic, rich super-sister
that you've run out of money

10:36.840 --> 10:39.400
is having to ask her to bail you out.

10:45.720 --> 10:47.631
I'm just gonna ask her.

10:49.520 --> 10:51.272
I'm just gonna ask her.

10:51.800 --> 10:53.711
I'm just gonna ask her.
I'm just gonna come...

10:53.760 --> 10:55.478
Do you need to borrow money?
- No.

10:55.520 --> 10:58.160
Can't do it, can't do it,
I can't do it. Can't do it.

10:58.200 --> 10:59.713
Your business is good then?

10:59.760 --> 11:02.274
Yeah. It's good. It's really good.
It's really, really good.

11:02.320 --> 11:03.719
Yeah, it's really good.

11:03.760 --> 11:05.478
Sounds like it's really good.

11:05.520 --> 11:07.158
It is.

11:08.480 --> 11:09.480
Hey.

11:09.520 --> 11:10.590
Hey.

11:12.440 --> 11:13.794
Can I get you anything?

11:13.840 --> 11:15.160
No thanks, I'm good.

12:01.720 --> 12:03.597
Are you sure I can't
get you anything at all?

12:03.640 --> 12:07.110
Is Harry helping?
Er, we broke up.

12:07.160 --> 12:08.878
What?! Again?

12:08.920 --> 12:12.072
Mmm. If you see him,
I'm a wreck, okay?

12:12.120 --> 12:16.478
God, just don't get drunk and
scream through his letterbox again.

12:16.520 --> 12:18.397
Wow, thanks for the vote of confidence.

12:18.440 --> 12:20.750
Don't get drunk and
shit in your sink again.

12:20.800 --> 12:23.076
When are you gonna
stop bringing that up?

12:23.120 --> 12:25.236
When you do something better!

12:25.760 --> 12:28.991
I have two degrees, a husband
and a Burberry coat.

12:29.040 --> 12:31.919
You shat in a sink!

12:31.960 --> 12:35.112
CLAIRE: Oh. Hi. - MAN: Thank you. Hi.
- FLEABAG: Oh, no problem.

12:37.040 --> 12:39.600
Nothing is ever going to be better.

12:44.760 --> 12:47.593
I swear there are pants
that give you thrush.

12:47.640 --> 12:49.358
What are yours made from?

12:50.240 --> 12:51.594
I dunno.

12:53.720 --> 12:55.552
FLEABAG:
I need to get sexy pants.

12:55.600 --> 12:58.672
BOO: I hate my body, I hate my body,
I hate my body, I hate my body.

12:58.720 --> 13:03.715
Fucking last minute bastard trendy parties,
why do we do it to ourselves.

13:06.520 --> 13:10.718
Oh my God, definitely not.
That does nothing for you. I hate that.

13:12.400 --> 13:13.720
What?

13:13.800 --> 13:16.314
These are my clothes, Boo,
I've been wearing these all day.

13:17.200 --> 13:18.793
Oh God.

13:19.440 --> 13:21.750
Were you wearing your coat?
- Yes.

13:21.800 --> 13:23.029
But...

13:23.960 --> 13:26.176
Well, nothing here looked nice so I just
thought I'd wear what I was wearing anyway.

13:26.200 --> 13:27.713
Are you joking?

13:27.760 --> 13:29.034
Are you joking?

13:29.680 --> 13:30.795
Yes.

13:33.040 --> 13:36.317
Oh my God! Why didn't you tell me!
- It's really not that bad! I love you!

13:36.360 --> 13:38.397
I've gotta get a whole new outfit now!

13:38.440 --> 13:42.035
I'll buy you pants, I'll buy you sexy
pants! - I've been so many places today!

13:42.080 --> 13:44.310
I'll buy you sexy pants!
- Fuck off!

13:44.360 --> 13:47.591
I'm sorry! I think it's a lovely dress!
- Get out of here!

13:47.640 --> 13:51.270
Oh, I mean, you really shouldn't
wear such cheap materials.

13:51.320 --> 13:53.038
They don't let your fanny breathe.

13:55.600 --> 13:56.920
I know.

13:56.960 --> 13:59.679
APPLAUSE

14:03.560 --> 14:08.430
Thank you so much for coming
to Women Speak

14:08.480 --> 14:11.950
opening women's mouths since 1998.

14:12.000 --> 14:16.312
Before we begin,
I would like to ask you a question.

14:16.360 --> 14:20.911
I don't know about you,
but I need some reassurance.

14:20.960 --> 14:22.473
SHE LAUGHS

14:23.680 --> 14:27.719
So I pose the question
to the women in this room today.

14:29.040 --> 14:31.793
Please raise your hands

14:32.440 --> 14:37.594
if you would trade
five years of your life

14:39.520 --> 14:42.433
for the so-called perfect body.

14:50.520 --> 14:52.557
We are bad feminists.

14:54.120 --> 14:56.316
I want my top back.
- Okay.

15:05.640 --> 15:08.712
Won't you get cold?
- No, I've got really hairy nipples.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.070
What?

15:17.200 --> 15:18.838
Oh!
- Fuck!

15:18.880 --> 15:20.154
Fuck!
- What was that?!

15:20.200 --> 15:22.111
Jesus!
- A fucking hug!

15:22.160 --> 15:23.560
Well, why the fuck did you do that?

15:23.584 --> 15:25.461
It was terrifying. Never do that again!

15:25.920 --> 15:27.479
I was just trying to...

15:34.960 --> 15:37.759
Are you okay?
- Yeah.

15:42.800 --> 15:45.713
Do you wanna go for a drink or...?
- No, I've got plans.

15:45.760 --> 15:48.718
Okay, fine. Sure, see you next time
'Women Speak' then.

15:53.040 --> 15:55.236
Do you wanna go for a drink?

16:04.840 --> 16:08.071
And my sister blows glass.
She has done for a long time.

16:08.120 --> 16:09.576
What was I saying,
I've never like been in a fight.

16:09.600 --> 16:11.856
Well, I've been in a fight. Never been
punched in the face, you know what I mean?

16:11.880 --> 16:15.032
I've been punched in the leg and someone
once threw some punch in my face.

16:15.080 --> 16:17.913
So my colours this season
are sort of brown mainly

16:17.960 --> 16:21.316
but like, you know,
I wouldn't say no to a maroon.

16:21.360 --> 16:24.671
I wouldn't like jump down the throat of
someone wearing something blue

16:24.720 --> 16:25.869
it's just not for me.

16:25.920 --> 16:28.275
So, I'm gonna go for a waz.

16:28.320 --> 16:30.072
HE LAUGHS
- Yep, okay.

16:36.800 --> 16:39.997
Same again? While I'm up.
Or perhaps like a little cocky-tail?

16:40.040 --> 16:41.394
Or like a nice shot?

16:41.440 --> 16:44.592
Oh, yeah, or we could
just go back to mine.

16:44.640 --> 16:46.392
Wow. Um, thanks.

16:46.440 --> 16:50.115
Er, I've actually got work, er, tomorrow,
but, um, another drink here?

16:50.160 --> 16:52.800
Or we could just go back to yours.
- Gotta be up really early so...

16:52.846 --> 16:55.726
Well, let's get you a cab in the morning.
- That's ridiculous. I can't...

16:55.750 --> 16:57.900
HE LAUGHS
- Okay, what the fuck is your problem?

16:58.320 --> 17:00.755
Oh, um, nothing.

17:00.800 --> 17:02.837
I, um, I like you.

17:02.880 --> 17:04.075
Okay, you're a dick.

17:04.800 --> 17:06.154
What's going on?

17:07.599 --> 17:09.511
You're pathetic.

17:09.560 --> 17:12.279
Wait!
- Oh, don't follow me.

17:12.319 --> 17:13.799
Oh. I wasn't.

17:14.319 --> 17:16.357
You dropped this.

17:21.319 --> 17:22.674
Um...

17:33.440 --> 17:34.510
Hey.

17:36.320 --> 17:37.879
Come on.

17:52.600 --> 17:54.113
Are you okay?

18:01.200 --> 18:03.111
Are you okay?

18:04.840 --> 18:06.592
Sad face.

18:08.080 --> 18:09.514
I'm fine.

18:18.920 --> 18:20.274
Oh.

18:21.680 --> 18:24.354
You're such a lovely man.

18:29.480 --> 18:32.040
Okay.
- Thank you.

18:33.720 --> 18:35.791
Stay there, stay there, you okay?

18:36.160 --> 18:38.834
Okay. Hey. Hey.

18:41.560 --> 18:44.120
Do you wanna come home with me?

18:44.160 --> 18:46.959
What?! No way!

18:48.040 --> 18:49.792
You naughty boy.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.837

Yeah?

Ah, it's nothing.

20:10.600 --> 20:13.069
It doesn't... it's...

20:25.600 --> 20:27.034
Oh fuck it...

20:27.080 --> 20:31.995
I have a horrible feeling that I'm
a greedy, perverted, selfish

20:32.040 --> 20:36.830
apathetic, cynical, depraved,
morally bankrupt woman

20:36.880 --> 20:39.474
who can't even call herself a feminist.

20:40.960 --> 20:42.997
Well, um...

20:48.320 --> 20:51.153
you get all that from your mother.

20:57.880 --> 20:59.871
SHE LAUGHS

21:02.200 --> 21:03.838
Good one.

21:03.880 --> 21:06.474
Er, I'm gonna call you a cab, darling

21:06.920 --> 21:10.629
and, um, please don't go upstairs.

21:43.160 --> 21:46.869
To be fair she's not
an evil stepmother.

21:46.920 --> 21:49.196
She's just a cunt.

21:51.200 --> 21:52.349
Hi.

21:53.280 --> 21:55.954
Darling, I thought that must be you.
Everything alright?

21:56.000 --> 21:58.389
Yeah, I just thought I'd swing by.

21:58.440 --> 22:00.431
Oh, how lovely. Lucky us.

22:00.480 --> 22:02.915
Oh don't worry,
Dad's already booking me a taxi.

22:08.600 --> 22:09.749
What you doin'?

22:09.800 --> 22:11.234
Oh, painting.

22:11.280 --> 22:14.910
I find the night time's very peaceful...

22:14.960 --> 22:17.270
Usually.
- THEY LAUGH

22:17.840 --> 22:19.797
Oh, warming up.

22:26.360 --> 22:28.920
Look, I know it's not really my place,
but are you okay?

22:28.960 --> 22:31.315
Everyone's been really worried.
- Poor fucker.

22:31.360 --> 22:37.311
Yes, she's actually an expression of how
women are subtle warriors, strong at heart.

22:37.360 --> 22:39.920
You know, we don't have to use
muscular force to get what we want

22:39.944 --> 22:43.699
we just use our...
- Tits. - innate femininity.

22:44.720 --> 22:47.519
Tits don't get you anywhere
these days. Trust me.

22:49.520 --> 22:51.591
It's very valuable actually.

22:51.640 --> 22:53.597
How much?
- Thousands.

22:53.640 --> 22:55.438
Whoa. Can I have it?

22:55.480 --> 22:56.959
SHE LAUGHS
- No.

23:05.240 --> 23:06.958
What's that?

23:07.000 --> 23:09.913
Oh, um, my self-portrait.

23:16.880 --> 23:18.029
Oh.

23:19.480 --> 23:22.916
DAD: Right, it's here.
- Oh, er, I think I can hear your dad.

23:25.480 --> 23:27.312
DAD:
Cab's here!

23:27.360 --> 23:28.589
Thanks.

23:28.640 --> 23:29.835
Ah, nice of him.

23:31.080 --> 23:34.232
Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

23:36.040 --> 23:41.831
Um, please look after yourself.
You really do look ghastly, darling.

23:49.360 --> 23:51.397
Oh, a café, eh?

23:51.440 --> 23:52.669
Yeah.

23:53.800 --> 23:55.757
On your own?

23:56.040 --> 23:57.394
Er, kind of.

23:58.040 --> 24:00.236
Kind of? Go on.

24:00.280 --> 24:03.193
SHE LAUGHS
- It's quite a funny story actually.

24:03.240 --> 24:06.278
On no, that's good,
it'll keep me going. Shoot.

24:08.040 --> 24:09.917
I opened the cafe with my friend, Boo.

24:09.960 --> 24:11.712
Cute name.
- Yeah.

24:11.760 --> 24:13.592
Yeah, she's dead now.

24:13.640 --> 24:15.756
She accidentally killed herself.

24:15.800 --> 24:18.713
It wasn't her intention
but it wasn't a total accident.

24:18.760 --> 24:20.273
She didn't actually think she'd die

24:20.320 --> 24:23.711
she just found out that her
boyfriend fucked someone else

24:23.760 --> 24:26.320
and wanted to punish him
by ending up in hospital

24:26.360 --> 24:28.590
and not letting him visit her for a bit.

24:28.640 --> 24:31.154
She decided to walk
into a busy cycle lane

24:31.200 --> 24:34.352
wanting to get tangled in a bike,
break a finger maybe.

24:34.400 --> 24:36.994
But as it turns out bikes go fast
and flip you into the road.

24:37.040 --> 24:39.998
Three people died,
she was such a dick.

24:42.800 --> 24:44.473
SHE LAUGHS

24:44.920 --> 24:47.196
So yeah. Kind of on my own.
