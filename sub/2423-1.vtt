01:00.102 --> 01:01.478
German bandits at two o'clock!

01:01.562 --> 01:02.896
Increase throttle! Power dive!

01:08.235 --> 01:10.445
Spell it right, Rafe.

01:10.571 --> 01:13.991
"Rudder" is spelled with two Ds.

01:14.116 --> 01:16.034
- Thanks, wingman.
- Yeah, sure.

01:17.286 --> 01:18.579
Whoa, bandits!

01:20.789 --> 01:22.207
Crack shootin', Danny.

01:22.291 --> 01:23.417
Crack shootin', Rafe.

01:23.458 --> 01:25.419
- Land of the free.
- Home of the brave.

01:45.063 --> 01:47.482
Great flyin',Dad!

01:49.651 --> 01:51.486
Come on.
I'm gonna teach you how to fly.

01:58.660 --> 01:59.953
I get the front!

01:59.995 --> 02:01.330
No, you take the back.

02:01.413 --> 02:03.582
I'm bigger,
and I should be in front.

02:03.665 --> 02:05.876
I'm older,
and I'm teachin', so no.

02:05.959 --> 02:07.836
Wow.
It's like we're really flying.

02:07.920 --> 02:09.253
Yeah, I did it lots of times.

02:09.338 --> 02:10.756
Come on, you man the guns.

02:10.839 --> 02:12.216
I'll give her some throttle.

02:12.299 --> 02:14.259
We gotta get those
dirty German bandits.

02:19.306 --> 02:21.225
Oh, gosh!

02:27.231 --> 02:29.816
- Hang on!
- Make it stop, Rafe!

02:31.860 --> 02:33.487
I've seen my dad
do this lots of times.

02:33.529 --> 02:35.197
Don't worry!

02:37.199 --> 02:38.617
Rafe!

02:40.202 --> 02:42.913
Oh, my gosh! We're flying!

02:42.996 --> 02:44.831
We're flying!

02:47.000 --> 02:48.168
Whoa! Uhh!

02:58.554 --> 03:01.139
Wow.

03:01.223 --> 03:02.850
My dad's gonna kill me.

03:02.891 --> 03:05.477
Come on.

03:05.561 --> 03:08.188
Yes! Whoo-hoo!

03:08.272 --> 03:09.398
We flew!

03:09.481 --> 03:11.483
We flew! Yes!
I'm a pilot!

03:11.567 --> 03:13.193
- I know!
- Yeah!

03:15.320 --> 03:16.530
We flew.

03:16.613 --> 03:18.323
- You no-account boy!
- Daddy-

03:18.407 --> 03:20.075
I done told you,
you spend time playing...

03:20.158 --> 03:22.327
with this stupid boy
can't read...

03:22.411 --> 03:24.037
you ain't never goin'
to amount to nothin'!

03:24.121 --> 03:26.748
He ain't stupid, Daddy!

03:26.874 --> 03:28.041
Daddy!

03:28.125 --> 03:30.043
Ohh!

03:30.085 --> 03:31.461
Come on!

03:31.545 --> 03:33.297
Uhh!

03:33.380 --> 03:36.175
Get on back home. Now!

03:38.760 --> 03:40.095
Get on up.

03:40.179 --> 03:41.847
You got work to do.

03:41.930 --> 03:44.516
Come on! Come on, get on home!

03:44.600 --> 03:46.810
Uhh!

03:46.894 --> 03:48.896
You let him alone!

03:50.230 --> 03:52.024
Daddy, no!

03:52.107 --> 03:54.443
I will bust you open,
you dirty German!

03:54.526 --> 03:56.945
What'd you call me?

03:58.822 --> 04:01.867
I fought the Germans in France.

04:01.950 --> 04:05.913
And I fought 'em
in the trenches.

04:05.996 --> 04:08.123
And I pray to God
no one ever has to see...

04:08.207 --> 04:09.541
the things that I saw.

04:25.933 --> 04:28.477
You're my bestfriend.

04:30.312 --> 04:32.397
Daddy, wait!

04:34.358 --> 04:36.109
Daddy, wait.

04:42.533 --> 04:44.034
Adolf Hitler...

04:44.117 --> 04:46.078
builds the German
military machine...

04:46.161 --> 04:48.205
and drags
all of Europe into war.

04:48.288 --> 04:50.624
But even while France
falls to Hitler...

04:50.666 --> 04:53.418
America still refuses
to join the fighting.

05:11.728 --> 05:13.814
- Where's McCawley and Walker?
- Still training, sir.

05:15.524 --> 05:17.568
Alright, Danny.
Now let's show 'em how to fly.

05:17.651 --> 05:19.027
We're gonna play chicken.
You ready?

05:19.069 --> 05:21.363
This ain't the farm,
and these ain't no cropdusters.

05:21.446 --> 05:22.573
I'm not playing
chicken with you.

05:22.656 --> 05:24.116
Now don't be a baby.
I'll tell you what-

05:24.199 --> 05:26.535
- I'm not doing it, Rafe.
- Well, I'm coming right at you.

05:26.618 --> 05:28.287
You can turn, or you can hit me.
It's up to you.

05:31.290 --> 05:32.416
What the-

05:32.499 --> 05:33.667
Oh, boy.

05:37.004 --> 05:39.298
Why you always
bustin' my ass, Rafe?

05:39.381 --> 05:40.632
Which way you goin'?

05:42.593 --> 05:45.345
I guess I'll go right.
No, uh, left. I'll go left.

05:47.723 --> 05:48.932
OK, we're goin' left, right?

05:49.016 --> 05:50.309
Ri-uh, right. Right?

05:50.392 --> 05:52.394
Right like we're goin' right,
or right like we're goin' left?

05:52.477 --> 05:54.021
Well, now you got me
all mixed up!

05:54.062 --> 05:56.064
I don't know.
Make up your mind.

05:58.400 --> 06:01.361
God, Rafe, we're going right!
Righty-tighty!

06:01.403 --> 06:03.572
Aah!

06:04.990 --> 06:08.619
- Whoo-hoo!
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!

06:11.121 --> 06:13.081
Those are some smooth aces.

06:13.207 --> 06:15.250
Did you say something?

06:15.375 --> 06:17.544
'Cause let me tell ya,
those farm boys are grounded!

06:17.628 --> 06:19.880
Yes, sir, an entirely
unacceptable use...

06:19.963 --> 06:22.633
of m-m-military aircraft, sir.

06:24.092 --> 06:25.552
- Get my hat.
- Yes, sir.

06:25.594 --> 06:28.639
Get those hedge-hoppers
in Doolittle's office.

06:28.722 --> 06:31.058
After two years of training...

06:31.099 --> 06:33.435
you believe that
a $45,000 airplane...

06:33.519 --> 06:34.978
is there for your amusement?

06:35.062 --> 06:36.271
No, sir.
I was just trying...

06:36.355 --> 06:37.606
to keep my edge, Major.

06:37.689 --> 06:39.483
And when you did
the outside loop last week...

06:39.566 --> 06:41.985
what did you think that was?
Honing your skills?

06:42.069 --> 06:43.278
That's not training, McCawley.

06:43.403 --> 06:44.571
That's a stunt.

06:44.696 --> 06:46.907
And I personally
consider it to be reckless...

06:46.990 --> 06:50.452
and irresponsible.

06:50.536 --> 06:51.703
Major...

06:54.414 --> 06:55.666
How could that be,
when you're famous...

06:55.749 --> 06:57.417
for being the first man
in the world ever to do it?

06:57.459 --> 06:58.585
Don't get cute with me, son.

06:58.669 --> 07:01.129
No, sir, I don't mean
to be disrespectful.

07:01.171 --> 07:03.924
I just think that-
well, I-

07:04.007 --> 07:05.175
It is reckless
and irresponsible...

07:05.259 --> 07:06.468
if you're just doing it
to be a show-off.

07:06.552 --> 07:10.180
But I was doing it to try
to inspire the men, sir...

07:10.264 --> 07:11.557
in the way that
you've inspired me.

07:11.640 --> 07:13.725
I believe the French
even have a word for that...

07:13.809 --> 07:15.602
when the men get together
to honor their leaders.

07:15.644 --> 07:16.979
They call it an homage, sir.

07:17.104 --> 07:18.897
- A what?
- An homage, sir.

07:18.981 --> 07:20.607
That's bullshit, McCawley!

07:23.986 --> 07:26.989
But it's very,
very good bullshit.

07:27.114 --> 07:28.240
Thank you, sir.

07:31.076 --> 07:34.705
McCawley, you remind me
of myself fifteen years ago.

07:34.788 --> 07:36.748
Which is why we need
to discuss this.

07:36.832 --> 07:38.792
Have a seat, son.

07:46.508 --> 07:49.303
The British have accepted you
into the Eagle Squadron.

07:49.386 --> 07:51.763
You're on your way
to England tomorrow...

07:51.847 --> 07:53.932
if you still want to go.

07:54.016 --> 07:56.476
Huh. Wow.

07:56.518 --> 07:58.478
Just a few British pilots
are all that stand...

07:58.520 --> 08:00.856
between Hitler
and total victory in Europe.

08:00.939 --> 08:02.941
They're gonna need
all the help they can get.

08:03.025 --> 08:04.401
Yes, sir.
Well, I'm on my way.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.820
Just for the record...

08:06.862 --> 08:08.739
I'm supposed to ask you
to reconsider.

08:08.822 --> 08:10.324
Sir?

08:10.407 --> 08:12.367
Sooner or later
we're gonna be in this war...

08:12.409 --> 08:14.369
whether we like it or not.

08:14.453 --> 08:16.747
And I'm gonna need
all of my best pilots.

08:16.830 --> 08:19.625
So it's my duty
to ask you to stay.

08:19.708 --> 08:22.836
Major, what would you do?

08:25.214 --> 08:26.882
If it was me...

08:29.218 --> 08:31.178
I'd go.

08:31.428 --> 08:33.597
Get out. Am I going bald
right back here?

08:33.679 --> 08:34.806
Ooh!

08:34.890 --> 08:38.101
Man, I am one good-lookin'
son of a bitch.

08:38.184 --> 08:39.770
Don't you ever die.

08:39.852 --> 08:42.438
Die. That's exactly...

08:42.523 --> 08:45.526
the concept
you gotta work tonight.

08:45.609 --> 08:49.029
You put a drop of this clove oil
under your eyes...

08:49.071 --> 08:51.073
and you let 'em sting
and well up.

08:51.156 --> 08:54.493
You get your nurse alone,
take a breath...

08:54.576 --> 08:56.912
let her see your eyes glisten...

08:56.995 --> 09:01.416
and say, "Baby,
they're training me for war...

09:01.500 --> 09:04.378
"and I don't know
what'll happen...

09:04.419 --> 09:07.673
"but if I die tomorrow,
I want to know...

09:07.756 --> 09:11.718
"that we lived
all we could tonight. "

09:11.760 --> 09:13.720
Come on, guys!
We got nurses waitin'.

09:13.762 --> 09:16.557
Come on, before the rest
of his hair falls out.

09:16.640 --> 09:20.102
How could you do this?

09:20.143 --> 09:21.645
Well, Doolittle assigned me.

09:21.728 --> 09:24.940
He wanted me to get some real-
real combat training in.

09:25.023 --> 09:26.149
Well, guess what?

09:26.233 --> 09:28.402
It's not training over there.
It's war.

09:28.443 --> 09:30.696
Where the losers die,
and there aren't any winners-

09:30.779 --> 09:31.905
just guys who turn
into broken-down wrecks...

09:32.030 --> 09:33.115
like my father.

09:33.240 --> 09:34.408
Yeah, I understand that, Danny.

09:34.491 --> 09:35.742
But I feel like
I got a duty to go.

09:35.826 --> 09:37.828
Don't preach to me
about duty, damn it.

09:37.953 --> 09:39.746
I wear the same uniform you do.

09:39.788 --> 09:42.583
Now, if trouble wants me,
I'm ready for it.

09:42.666 --> 09:43.792
But why go looking for it?

09:43.876 --> 09:45.919
God, Danny, come on.

09:46.003 --> 09:48.380
I'm gonna be twenty-five.
I might as well be an old man.

09:48.463 --> 09:50.465
They're gonna have me bein'
a flight instructor.

09:50.549 --> 09:52.968
I don't wanna teach
loops and barrel rolls.

09:53.010 --> 09:54.303
I wanna be a combat fighter.

09:54.386 --> 09:55.512
Hey, come on!

09:55.596 --> 09:58.724
The nurses can't
d- d-dance by themselves.

09:58.807 --> 10:00.517
Let's go.

10:09.651 --> 10:12.362
If the call of duty
means seeing 150 men...

10:12.446 --> 10:13.906
in their underwear every day...

10:13.989 --> 10:15.240
we are here to serve.

10:16.491 --> 10:17.659
I can't believe it.

10:17.743 --> 10:19.745
Saturday night
in New York City.

10:19.828 --> 10:21.455
Do you know what they're doing
where I come from?

10:21.497 --> 10:22.915
Nothing.

10:22.998 --> 10:24.750
Cow-tipping.

10:24.833 --> 10:26.001
Well, that's why
you joined the Navy, hon'.

10:26.084 --> 10:28.295
To get out of that dusty
little town and see the world.

10:28.337 --> 10:30.964
May I remind you, Barbara,
we're Navy nurses, not tourists.

10:31.048 --> 10:33.800
I joined to do
my patriotic duty and...

10:33.884 --> 10:36.053
to meet guys.

10:36.136 --> 10:37.513
Me, too.

10:37.638 --> 10:39.306
Girls, we're gonna have
so much fun tonight in the city.

10:39.389 --> 10:40.849
You've gotta tell them
the story, Evelyn.

10:40.974 --> 10:42.851
What?

10:42.893 --> 10:44.061
Oh, come on. Tell us.

10:44.186 --> 10:45.646
Oh, it's such a long story.

10:45.729 --> 10:47.689
We got time.

10:47.731 --> 10:49.566
I saw it happen.

10:49.650 --> 10:51.818
Well, it was
about four weeks ago...

10:51.902 --> 10:53.946
What do you think
is b-b-better?

10:54.029 --> 10:56.365
All in the one cheek,
or spreading them out?

10:57.699 --> 10:58.825
OK.

10:58.867 --> 11:01.203
Fusco, Anthony.

11:05.999 --> 11:07.835
You all right, buddy?

11:07.876 --> 11:10.087
Sweetie, do you really
have to do this?

11:10.170 --> 11:13.173
I'm not gonna get yellow fever
in my barracks.

11:13.298 --> 11:16.260
No? If you'd rather,
she can do it.

11:20.848 --> 11:23.183
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Just gimme a minute.

11:23.225 --> 11:26.520
Honey, the government
says stick 'em, we stick 'em.

11:26.562 --> 11:27.771
Uh!

11:30.774 --> 11:32.192
Hey, Red, you alright?

11:34.653 --> 11:37.990
Eye exam number four?

11:38.073 --> 11:41.660
Listen, Doc, I have passed
a dozen medical checks.

11:41.743 --> 11:43.912
You write that,
they won't let me fly.

11:43.996 --> 11:46.456
Sorry, son.

11:46.540 --> 11:47.916
I'm gonna fail.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.543
They're gonna
take my wings away.

11:49.668 --> 11:51.879
No, they won't. Just relax.

11:51.962 --> 11:53.463
Read the bottom line, please.

11:53.589 --> 11:54.882
Just keep practicin'
the bottom line.

11:54.923 --> 11:56.717
And don't worry.
I'm right behind you.

11:56.800 --> 11:59.553
J- L-M-K-P-O-

12:03.432 --> 12:05.017
Next.

12:05.100 --> 12:06.476
Ma'am.

12:09.563 --> 12:12.524
J- L-M-K-P-O-E-T-X.

12:12.608 --> 12:14.026
Eyes like an eagle, ma'am.

12:14.109 --> 12:15.944
Slow down, flyboy.

12:16.028 --> 12:18.739
And, instead of the bottom,
read the very top. Both eyes.

12:18.822 --> 12:21.909
Yeah.

12:21.992 --> 12:25.412
"C"- sorry, "J."

12:25.454 --> 12:27.414
Ahem. "C"...

12:27.456 --> 12:28.707
- "W."
- "W."

12:28.790 --> 12:31.001
- "Q."
- Uh, "Q."

12:31.084 --> 12:32.753
Uh, "'Q."'

12:35.380 --> 12:37.508
Read the bottom line
again, please.

12:37.591 --> 12:41.595
But read it right to left
and every other letter.

12:48.310 --> 12:49.937
"E."

12:49.978 --> 12:52.564
Heh. "'X."'

12:52.648 --> 12:54.942
- X-E.
- X-E.

12:55.025 --> 12:57.402
X- E, ma'am.

12:57.486 --> 13:00.072
Ma'am, I know how this looks.

13:00.155 --> 13:01.782
I'm sorry, Lieutenant,
I really am.

13:01.865 --> 13:03.951
But Army and Navy
requires 20/20 vision.

13:04.034 --> 13:06.662
Oh, i-it's-it's not
a problem with my eyes.

13:06.745 --> 13:07.955
I mean, I can see.

13:07.996 --> 13:09.790
I mean, I can hit a running
rabbit with a $3.00 pistol.

13:09.832 --> 13:11.375
I got a problem with letters,
that's all.

13:11.458 --> 13:13.001
Well, maybe after
some schooling...

13:13.085 --> 13:14.670
you could come back
and take the test again.

13:14.753 --> 13:15.963
No, I had schooling.

13:16.046 --> 13:17.339
I mean, I-the teachers
just never knew...

13:17.422 --> 13:19.341
what to make of it.
It's just letters.

13:19.424 --> 13:20.884
I mix 'em up sometimes.
That's all.

13:20.968 --> 13:24.263
I mean, I just get 'em
backward sometimes.

13:24.346 --> 13:27.766
L- look here. Uh, my-my math
and-and spacial reasoning...

13:27.850 --> 13:29.184
and my verbal scores
are all excellent.

13:29.268 --> 13:31.061
But you barely passed
the written exam.

13:31.144 --> 13:33.272
Yeah, but he did pass it.
So, is it my turn now?

13:33.355 --> 13:36.650
- No, you'll wait your turn.
- Yes, ma'am.

13:36.692 --> 13:38.902
Ma'am, I-I'm never gonna
be an English teacher.

13:38.986 --> 13:41.446
But I know why I'm here.

13:41.530 --> 13:42.990
To be a pilot.

13:43.073 --> 13:44.700
And you don't dogfight
with manuals.

13:44.783 --> 13:46.743
You don't fly with gauges.

13:46.827 --> 13:48.078
I mean, it's all about
feeling and speed...

13:48.162 --> 13:49.496
and lettin' that plane
become like a part...

13:49.538 --> 13:51.123
of your body.
And that manual...

13:51.206 --> 13:53.458
says that a guy who's a slow
reader can't be a good pilot.

13:53.542 --> 13:55.544
That file says I'm
the best pilot in this room.

13:59.339 --> 14:04.511
Ma'am, please,
don't take my wings.

14:06.221 --> 14:07.973
Well, I felt so bad.

14:08.056 --> 14:10.767
Evelyn, rotate to station three.

14:10.851 --> 14:12.144
I had no choice.

14:12.227 --> 14:14.188
I passed him.

14:14.271 --> 14:15.564
- Good.
- Uh-huh.

14:15.647 --> 14:18.567
So, then this
cocky pilot comes back.

14:18.609 --> 14:20.861
- Say, fella, are you enlisted?
- Yeah.

14:20.944 --> 14:23.030
"Yeah"? Boy,
you're talking to an officer.

14:23.113 --> 14:24.364
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

14:24.448 --> 14:25.699
- Give me that file.
- Yes, sir.

14:25.741 --> 14:28.076
- Parade rest.
- Yes, sir.

14:28.160 --> 14:29.870
Ma'am, I didn't get
a chance to thank you.

14:29.912 --> 14:31.121
Drop your skivvies.

14:31.246 --> 14:34.208
Ah, oh, OK.

14:34.291 --> 14:37.044
Just like this?

14:37.127 --> 14:38.921
That's fine.

14:39.004 --> 14:41.673
He did have
a very cute butt.

14:41.757 --> 14:43.217
You know, I know
you didn't have to pass me...

14:43.300 --> 14:44.551
and you did. And I just-

14:44.635 --> 14:47.387
I didn't think
you'd understand, and you did.

14:47.471 --> 14:50.098
You know, you still
haven't said thank you.

14:50.182 --> 14:51.308
Thank you.

14:51.391 --> 14:53.393
You're welcome.

14:53.435 --> 14:56.438
Why'd you do it?
I mean, I'm just curious.

14:56.480 --> 14:58.232
You're like my hero now.

14:58.273 --> 15:00.067
Actually, my father was a pilot.

15:00.150 --> 15:02.444
And, um, I've seen
first-hand what happens...

15:02.528 --> 15:04.112
when a pilot loses his wings.

15:04.196 --> 15:05.322
You know what?

15:05.447 --> 15:07.699
Your father's my hero,
then, too.

15:07.783 --> 15:11.286
Infact, as an officer,
I think it'd by my duty...

15:11.411 --> 15:13.747
to take my new hero's
daughter out tonight...

15:13.789 --> 15:16.083
Just to-aah!

15:16.124 --> 15:17.459
Gosh, did I poke too deep?

15:17.543 --> 15:20.170
I think you hit the bone there.

15:21.630 --> 15:23.006
You are so mean.

15:25.300 --> 15:27.928
What? So is-
is there any chance...

15:27.970 --> 15:30.222
that you might,
kind of, sort of...

15:30.305 --> 15:32.891
you know, like me, or...

15:32.975 --> 15:37.145
Oh, how did you guess?

15:37.229 --> 15:38.730
They never taught us...

15:38.814 --> 15:41.275
how to deal with this...
feeling.

15:43.652 --> 15:45.571
Wh-what feeling?

15:45.654 --> 15:48.949
Well, it's kind of like... this.

15:48.991 --> 15:50.617
Ow!

15:50.659 --> 15:53.412
Well, he was getting fresh,
so I poked him again.

15:54.830 --> 15:58.083
All right, Romeo.
I want to get this over with.

15:58.167 --> 16:00.335
Hold on a second.

16:00.419 --> 16:01.461
Miss...

16:01.545 --> 16:03.881
I really, really lick you.

16:05.924 --> 16:07.467
What did he mean?

16:07.509 --> 16:09.219
Like you.

16:09.303 --> 16:10.512
I didn't mean to say that.

16:10.596 --> 16:11.805
And I just, um...

16:11.930 --> 16:14.308
I just want to ask you, please,
if I can donate dinner.

16:14.349 --> 16:16.435
He started
to act very strange.

16:16.518 --> 16:19.521
Or, well, buy you dinner.

16:19.563 --> 16:21.148
This isn't your chart.

16:21.190 --> 16:23.275
Whoa.

16:23.358 --> 16:27.362
No. That's the, uh, this,
uh, fellow over here's.

16:27.446 --> 16:28.572
I think he left.

16:28.655 --> 16:30.282
Have you already had this shot?

16:30.365 --> 16:33.202
Yeah, well, once... already.

16:34.536 --> 16:36.997
Well, I wanted-
I mean, can I ask you out?

16:37.039 --> 16:39.082
No!

16:39.166 --> 16:41.293
And he just went wham!

16:42.503 --> 16:44.922
Unh!

16:45.047 --> 16:47.341
Oh! What'd you do to him?

16:47.424 --> 16:50.052
Poor guy.

16:53.013 --> 16:56.433
Hey!

16:56.517 --> 16:57.893
Oh, my God.
Are you OK?

16:57.976 --> 17:00.103
Uh, yeah.

17:00.187 --> 17:01.647
I'm fine. I feel great.

17:01.730 --> 17:06.151
This is just standard
precautionary... thing.

17:06.234 --> 17:09.655
Look, I got some, uh,
genuine French champagne...

17:09.738 --> 17:10.948
from France.

17:11.031 --> 17:13.700
I thought, you know,
maybe we could celebrate.

17:13.742 --> 17:15.077
Celebrate what?

17:15.160 --> 17:19.915
Oh, I don't know. Uh, well,
you being my hero, for one.

17:22.125 --> 17:25.212
OK. Why not?

17:26.964 --> 17:28.799
So, uh, ahem...

17:28.882 --> 17:30.300
I wanted to thank you.

17:30.384 --> 17:32.135
And I just wanted to, uh...

17:32.219 --> 17:34.721
put your mind at ease
about passing me...

17:34.763 --> 17:37.891
because I really do think
you did this country a service.

17:37.933 --> 17:41.353
I mean, I'm-
I am a great flier.

17:41.436 --> 17:44.398
And if you have a fault,
which you obviously don't...

17:44.439 --> 17:47.067
it's modesty.

17:47.109 --> 17:51.029
No. If I have a fault,
it's candor.

17:52.489 --> 17:54.491
You are just so-

17:56.660 --> 17:59.663
Uhh. Cork just got away from me.

18:08.589 --> 18:10.090
God, oh, it hurts.

18:10.174 --> 18:13.844
It hurts something fierce.

18:13.927 --> 18:15.095
I'm sorry.

18:15.137 --> 18:16.680
- Ohh...
- Oh, it's bleeding.

18:16.763 --> 18:18.849
- God.
- Oh!

18:18.932 --> 18:20.934
- Ohh!
- Lay still.

18:21.018 --> 18:22.144
I ruined everything.

18:22.227 --> 18:23.562
- Lay still.
- Oh, it hurts.

18:23.645 --> 18:25.731
- Ow! It's cold.
- It'll stop the bleeding.

18:25.814 --> 18:27.399
Yeah. I can't breathe.

18:27.482 --> 18:30.027
Lay still.

18:33.989 --> 18:36.283
You are so beautiful it hurts.

18:36.366 --> 18:39.453
It's your nose that hurts.

18:39.536 --> 18:42.915
No. I think it's my heart.

18:50.464 --> 18:53.383
And then I kissed him.

18:53.467 --> 18:55.928
Oh, Evelyn.

18:56.011 --> 18:58.639
That's the most romantic story
I ever heard.

18:58.722 --> 19:04.269
It's been the most romantic four
weeks and two days of my life.

19:04.353 --> 19:06.146
Oh, I'm so jealous.

19:25.541 --> 19:26.875
Hello, Lieutenant.

19:26.959 --> 19:29.253
- It's good to see you.
- You, too, Lieutenant.

19:29.336 --> 19:31.505
Pick a hand.

19:35.467 --> 19:37.219
It's beautiful.

19:39.137 --> 19:41.056
What's in your other hand?

19:41.139 --> 19:42.599
Mine.

19:44.601 --> 19:47.563
Well, it took me six hours
to fold these.

19:49.231 --> 19:50.357
Oh!

19:52.901 --> 19:54.945
I want you to meet my friends.

19:55.028 --> 19:58.198
Rafe, this is Martha,
Barbara, Sandra-

19:58.282 --> 20:01.034
- Hi. I'm Betty.
- Hi.

20:01.118 --> 20:03.370
Would you happen
to have any friends?

20:03.412 --> 20:06.790
Huh. Take your pick.

20:06.915 --> 20:08.458
Hi.

20:14.006 --> 20:15.299
Whoo!

20:32.983 --> 20:35.235
We ever get in this war
and somethin' happens to me...

20:35.319 --> 20:39.281
I can't tell you how good
it makes me feel to know...

20:39.364 --> 20:41.783
that someone as sweet
as you will be there...

20:41.867 --> 20:43.535
to nurse me back to health.

20:43.619 --> 20:45.954
Good, but we're not
in the war yet.

20:46.038 --> 20:48.540
- Ahem.
- OK. That was a bad line.

20:48.624 --> 20:50.918
Hi.

20:51.001 --> 20:53.587
I'm-I'm Red.

20:53.629 --> 20:59.218
Red-
S- s-s-s-strange.

20:59.301 --> 21:01.094
Heh heh.
Your last name's Strange?

21:01.178 --> 21:02.554
Yeah. She's all yours, soldier.

21:02.638 --> 21:05.015
No. It-it's Winkle.

21:06.808 --> 21:08.519
Red is such a ladies' man.

21:08.602 --> 21:09.728
Do you always stutter?

21:09.811 --> 21:13.524
No. Only when I'm-

21:13.649 --> 21:14.775
She's totally buying it.

21:14.900 --> 21:16.777
- Nervous?
- Yeah.

21:16.818 --> 21:18.487
Why can't I get
something like that?

21:26.829 --> 21:27.996
Hello.

21:28.080 --> 21:29.623
Hi.

21:29.665 --> 21:32.251
Danny seems kind of shy
around the girls.

21:32.334 --> 21:35.754
Tsk. It's not that he's shy.

21:35.838 --> 21:37.089
He's just, ahem...

21:37.172 --> 21:39.591
a little unsure of himself,
you know.

21:39.675 --> 21:41.552
His old man used to
run him down a lot.

21:41.635 --> 21:45.305
Get him in a plane,
he's sure of himself.

21:45.389 --> 21:47.599
He's like my brother.
He's like my best friend.

21:47.683 --> 21:50.310
He's my right hand.

21:50.394 --> 21:54.815
Which at the moment is
a long way south of my waist.

21:54.857 --> 21:56.483
Oh, I'm sorry.

21:56.525 --> 21:59.152
I guess I lost
a little altitude.

21:59.194 --> 22:01.196
Yeah, I guess you did.

22:01.238 --> 22:02.739
Excuse me.

22:17.337 --> 22:19.715
You and me, we got to talk.

22:19.798 --> 22:23.385
So, the rumor is the Navy's
shipping us to Pearl Harbor.

22:23.510 --> 22:25.429
Well, won't be so bad.

22:25.512 --> 22:28.098
It's about as far from
the fighting as you can get.

22:28.182 --> 22:30.017
You'll get a sun tan.

22:30.058 --> 22:33.687
So maybe the Army'll
post you guys there, too.

22:33.770 --> 22:37.816
You... are a super special woman.

22:37.900 --> 22:39.276
And, and, well...

22:40.861 --> 22:42.738
Well, they're-
they're training me...

22:42.821 --> 22:47.951
to be a big bad warrior,
and, well...

22:50.412 --> 22:52.498
So, I mean, you never know
what might happen tomorrow...

22:52.581 --> 22:58.086
or... or any day
after that, you know?

22:58.212 --> 23:00.672
So...

23:00.797 --> 23:03.842
God, we need to make
tonight super special.

23:03.926 --> 23:06.512
Why are you crying?

23:06.595 --> 23:08.222
I guess it's the thought...

23:08.263 --> 23:10.724
that I might not ever
get to see you again.

23:10.766 --> 23:12.518
Dry your eyes, toots.

23:12.601 --> 23:13.727
Tonight, you're mine.

23:13.810 --> 23:15.938
I don't want to be
with a crowd tonight.

23:16.021 --> 23:18.565
I just want to be
alone with you.

23:18.607 --> 23:20.567
Well...

23:20.609 --> 23:23.487
How does New York Harbor
by moonlight sound?

23:23.654 --> 23:25.739
Ohh! Heh heh!

23:25.822 --> 23:28.283
Are you gonna be
a bad influence?

23:28.325 --> 23:30.786
Of course I'm a bad influence.

23:30.869 --> 23:32.788
Let's see if we can
commandeer this vessel...

23:32.830 --> 23:35.082
'cause we're, uh, officers
of the U.S. Government.

23:35.165 --> 23:36.875
Not for long, we won't be.

23:47.928 --> 23:50.264
One day, we'll take a trip
on a boat like that.

23:50.305 --> 23:51.682
Would you like that?

23:51.765 --> 23:55.936
We'll be dressing for cocktails
and walk into the grandsalon.

23:55.978 --> 23:57.604
No one's talking about war.

23:57.646 --> 23:59.940
They're just dancing
to Cole Porter.

24:00.023 --> 24:02.609
- I'll have to get a tux.
- Yeah.

24:06.989 --> 24:09.741
Come on. There you go.
All aboard.

24:09.825 --> 24:11.869
- You're out of your mind.
- Oh, yeah.

24:11.952 --> 24:13.245
Careful now.
Here, sit down.

24:14.621 --> 24:16.456
Now let's see here.

24:18.792 --> 24:22.171
Ah! There we go.

24:23.797 --> 24:26.884
See, this is as close as I
could get you to your ship.

24:26.967 --> 24:29.094
So, at least I tried, right?

24:30.679 --> 24:33.015
Actually, you know what?
This is better.

24:33.140 --> 24:34.933
Yeah, it is.

24:35.017 --> 24:37.477
God, you're pretty.

24:56.163 --> 24:59.458
What's gonna become
of us all, Rafe?

25:01.168 --> 25:05.964
Well, the future's not
exactly in our hands, is it?

25:06.048 --> 25:08.675
No. I guess you're right.

25:18.936 --> 25:20.395
- Aah!
- Aah!

25:20.437 --> 25:23.023
Oh, my God!
Are you all right?

25:23.106 --> 25:24.358
Yeah, are you?

25:24.399 --> 25:26.026
That was not part of the date.

25:33.242 --> 25:34.368
Watch your step.

25:34.451 --> 25:37.037
Oh, thank you.

25:37.120 --> 25:38.372
Evelyn!

25:38.497 --> 25:41.124
Guys, come up! Come on up!

25:41.250 --> 25:44.086
Come up! We're in 321.

25:44.127 --> 25:46.088
There's something
I got to tell you.

25:46.129 --> 25:48.298
Well, you got no secrets
from me, Lieutenant.

25:48.382 --> 25:49.925
I've seen your medical chart.

25:50.008 --> 25:51.426
Here we go.

25:57.432 --> 26:00.727
This can't be good, or it
wouldn't be so hard to say.

26:00.769 --> 26:02.354
Yep.

26:02.437 --> 26:04.857
I got to go away.

26:04.940 --> 26:07.359
We're all going away.

26:07.442 --> 26:09.194
Yeah...

26:09.278 --> 26:12.906
but I'm going to the war...
tomorrow.

26:14.116 --> 26:15.909
I'm flying with
the Eagle Squadron.

26:15.993 --> 26:20.247
It's an outfit the British
started for American pilots.

26:20.289 --> 26:24.376
I don't understand.

26:24.459 --> 26:27.379
You're in the U.S. Army.
How could they order you to go?

26:27.462 --> 26:29.882
They didn't order me.

26:29.965 --> 26:32.050
I volunteered.

26:34.511 --> 26:36.972
Huh.

26:37.014 --> 26:39.224
But I passed you.

26:39.308 --> 26:41.977
I let you through.

26:42.060 --> 26:43.729
And now you volunteer...

26:43.812 --> 26:45.898
for the most dangerous place
you could go?

26:45.981 --> 26:49.943
It's not your responsibility,
not your choice.

26:49.985 --> 26:52.863
Flying's the only thing
I ever wanted to do.

26:52.946 --> 26:57.242
I mean, everything in my life
has led me up to this point.

26:59.995 --> 27:01.622
Meeting you.

27:05.292 --> 27:06.460
I love you.

27:08.795 --> 27:10.923
I love you so much.

27:13.842 --> 27:15.761
Let's go inside.

27:23.435 --> 27:25.729
All right. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

27:25.812 --> 27:27.439
Just-I-I can't do this.

27:27.523 --> 27:31.193
This just-it's not right.
I'm sorry. I just-

27:31.276 --> 27:32.736
See, I can't do this.

27:32.819 --> 27:35.864
I mean, I mean, I can.
I- I want to.

27:35.948 --> 27:38.784
I'm not trying to be noble,
you know.

27:38.867 --> 27:41.036
Or not saying
I know what would happen...

27:41.119 --> 27:43.163
or just-
I need to stop talking.

27:43.247 --> 27:45.040
I just-I just don't want-

27:45.123 --> 27:46.834
I just don't want it
to be like everybody else.

27:46.917 --> 27:48.877
I don't want you to have
anything about tonight...

27:48.961 --> 27:50.754
that you regret.

27:50.838 --> 27:54.174
I mean, it's been the most
incredible night of my life...

27:54.258 --> 27:56.593
and I don't want to ruin that.

27:56.677 --> 27:58.637
Oh, you couldn't ruin it.

28:00.180 --> 28:05.978
If I had one more night to live,
I'd want to spend it with you.

28:07.437 --> 28:09.731
See, that's what I want
to come home to.

28:09.815 --> 28:13.193
That's what I want to have
to think about and dream about.

28:13.235 --> 28:15.863
I want to know that
the best part of my life...

28:15.904 --> 28:17.781
is still ahead of me.

28:18.907 --> 28:20.534
Look.

28:20.576 --> 28:26.373
Don't, um... could you...
not come see me off?

28:26.456 --> 28:29.960
Because, uh... saying good-bye
to you once is hard enough.

28:33.130 --> 28:35.424
Here.

28:37.926 --> 28:39.219
Take this.

28:39.261 --> 28:41.889
Why?
You think it looks good on me?

28:46.268 --> 28:48.395
I will come back.

29:24.848 --> 29:27.184
I thought you said
you told her not to come.

29:27.267 --> 29:28.519
Yeah, I did.

29:28.602 --> 29:30.270
Why you looking for her then?

29:30.312 --> 29:33.023
It's my test.

29:33.148 --> 29:35.192
If I tell her not to come,
and she comes anyway...

29:35.317 --> 29:37.611
then I-I know she loves me.

29:37.694 --> 29:39.905
All aboard! Track 57!

29:44.618 --> 29:47.538
If, uh, anything
happens to me...

29:47.621 --> 29:49.957
I want you to be the one
to tell her.

29:50.040 --> 29:51.542
All right?

29:51.625 --> 29:55.295
You just make sure and come back
for the both of us, all right?

29:55.379 --> 29:57.840
OK.

30:08.851 --> 30:10.519
See you when I get back.

30:10.644 --> 30:11.937
Yeah.

30:15.190 --> 30:17.401
Good hunting, Rafe.

30:40.549 --> 30:42.092
Evelyn!

30:42.217 --> 30:43.343
Evelyn!

30:44.219 --> 30:45.345
Evelyn!

30:49.725 --> 30:51.101
Evelyn!

30:51.185 --> 30:52.436
Evelyn.

30:52.519 --> 30:54.813
Hey!

31:01.612 --> 31:03.363
She loves me.

31:06.575 --> 31:08.076
The German Luftwaffe...

31:08.118 --> 31:11.205
relentlessly bombards
downtown London...

31:11.330 --> 31:13.248
while Churchill's
Royal Air Force...

31:13.332 --> 31:14.750
is in a deadly struggle...

31:14.833 --> 31:17.920
to maintain control
of the British skies.

31:39.733 --> 31:41.318
This is a real mess.

31:41.401 --> 31:45.030
Lieutenant McCawley
reporting for duty, sir.

31:47.407 --> 31:48.492
Good.

31:48.617 --> 31:51.370
We'll get you settled
into your quarters.

31:51.453 --> 31:54.706
And then introduce you
to the crate you'll be flying.

31:54.790 --> 31:58.210
If y'all are patching up
bullet holes here...

31:58.293 --> 31:59.503
maybe we ought
to skip housekeeping...

31:59.586 --> 32:00.921
and get me in an airplane.

32:00.963 --> 32:02.256
Two didn't come back, sir.

32:02.297 --> 32:04.091
We counted only eleven.

32:10.848 --> 32:12.850
Are all Yanks
as anxious as you...

32:12.933 --> 32:14.935
to get themselves killed,
Pilot Officer?

32:15.018 --> 32:18.230
Not anxious to die, sir.
Just anxious to matter.

32:24.152 --> 32:25.863
This is yours.

32:27.614 --> 32:29.074
Good chap.

32:29.158 --> 32:32.244
Didn't die till he'd landed
and shut down his engine.

32:46.550 --> 32:48.135
Please be seated, gentlemen.

32:51.430 --> 32:53.807
I'm afraid I'm in a bad mood.

32:53.891 --> 32:59.146
Churchill and Stalin are
asking me what I'm asking you.

32:59.229 --> 33:02.232
How long is America
going to pretend...

33:02.357 --> 33:04.067
the world is not at war?

33:04.151 --> 33:06.904
We've increased food and oil
shipments, Mr. President...

33:06.987 --> 33:08.280
and as far as I know-

33:08.363 --> 33:10.949
What they really need
are tanks, planes...

33:11.033 --> 33:12.743
bullets, bombs,
and men to fight.

33:12.826 --> 33:16.997
But our people think
Hitler and his Nazi thugs...

33:17.080 --> 33:19.124
are Europe's problem.

33:19.208 --> 33:22.669
We have to do more.

33:22.753 --> 33:25.214
Send the Brits and Russians
more of our ships...

33:25.339 --> 33:26.798
and anti-aircraft weapons.

33:26.882 --> 33:28.800
And keep cannibalizing
the Pacific Fleet?

33:28.884 --> 33:30.385
What choice do we have?

33:30.511 --> 33:35.224
We're building refrigerators
while our enemies build bombs.

34:44.042 --> 34:45.585
This is so exciting.

34:45.668 --> 34:48.130
You know there's about
one hundred ships on Pearl.

34:48.172 --> 34:49.630
How many sailors per ship?

34:49.672 --> 34:52.050
It depends.
More on a battleship than a sub.

34:52.134 --> 34:54.594
But say, on average... 2,000?

34:54.636 --> 34:57.890
Then there's the flyers,
the marines, base personnel.

34:57.973 --> 34:59.266
I'm still working on
the sailors.

34:59.308 --> 35:01.810
Girls, I think the odds
are in your favor.

35:01.852 --> 35:03.687
Yeah, like 4,000 to one.

35:03.770 --> 35:06.273
It's paradise.

35:06.398 --> 35:08.192
See you on the beach, boys!

35:08.317 --> 35:10.777
We're in Hawaii!

35:16.825 --> 35:18.619
Hey!

35:18.702 --> 35:21.205
You're not supposed
to paint titties...

35:21.288 --> 35:22.623
on the side of my airplanes.

35:22.706 --> 35:25.292
And if you do,
don't make 'em lopsided.

35:25.334 --> 35:26.460
They were lopsided, Earl.

35:26.543 --> 35:27.794
Look, it says right here.

35:27.878 --> 35:32.132
"Never ride waves amongst
rocks or submerged pilings. "

35:32.216 --> 35:33.967
See, it says
you shouldn't do that.

35:34.009 --> 35:37.012
How do you know they're
submerged if they're submerged?

35:37.054 --> 35:39.640
Gooz, what in the hell
are you doing?

35:39.723 --> 35:41.642
Just trying to fix
this surfboard thing.

35:41.683 --> 35:43.810
He keeps taking chunks off
his nose on the rocks.

35:43.936 --> 35:46.355
On my day off, I'm working
on my new invention-

35:46.396 --> 35:49.107
the Gooz Cruise Fin.

35:49.191 --> 35:50.651
I'm gonna be a rich fella.

35:50.692 --> 35:52.820
Every surfboard in
the nation's gonna need one.

35:52.903 --> 35:54.571
Yeah? Well,
you're gonna need a broom.

35:54.655 --> 35:57.115
Check out these new recruits.

35:59.493 --> 36:00.661
Hi.

36:00.702 --> 36:02.496
Aloha.

36:02.579 --> 36:04.998
Y'all pilots?

36:05.040 --> 36:07.125
We're working on it.

36:07.209 --> 36:09.169
It's a lot of switches
and stuff.

36:10.420 --> 36:14.091
Pride of the Pacific.

36:14.216 --> 36:16.677
Who are you?

36:16.718 --> 36:18.262
Terrors of the skies.

36:20.931 --> 36:22.057
Welcome, ladies.

36:22.140 --> 36:23.767
Hi.

36:23.851 --> 36:26.520
I have to deal with
toasty sun burnt fanny...

36:26.562 --> 36:28.689
before I can show you around.

36:28.772 --> 36:30.816
Ow!

36:33.610 --> 36:35.612
Dear Evelyn.

36:35.696 --> 36:38.365
It's different than I thought
it would be here.

36:38.407 --> 36:40.033
It's cold-

36:40.117 --> 36:45.038
so cold it goes deep
into your bones.

36:45.122 --> 36:48.083
There is one place
I can go to find warmth.

36:48.167 --> 36:50.460
That is to think of you.

36:50.544 --> 36:53.005
I just wish I could be
back there with you.

36:56.258 --> 36:58.677
It's not easy making friends.

36:58.760 --> 37:00.053
Two days ago, I had a beer...

37:00.095 --> 37:02.097
with a couple
of the RAF pilots.

37:02.139 --> 37:04.308
Yesterday,
both of them got killed.

37:17.237 --> 37:19.198
Dear Rafe.

37:19.323 --> 37:21.867
I miss you so much.

37:21.950 --> 37:25.787
It's so strange to be
half a world away from you.

37:27.164 --> 37:28.624
I'm right on his tail!

37:34.671 --> 37:37.382
Got one!

37:37.466 --> 37:40.427
Every night
I look at the sunset...

37:40.511 --> 37:43.889
and try to draw the last ounce
of heat from its long day...

37:43.972 --> 37:47.518
and send it
from my heart to yours.

37:53.482 --> 37:54.608
Family?

37:54.691 --> 37:57.820
Girl, sir.

37:57.945 --> 38:00.405
The girl.

38:02.074 --> 38:04.284
A lot of people
frown on the Yanks...

38:04.368 --> 38:05.994
for not being in this war yet.

38:06.078 --> 38:07.913
I'd just like to say...

38:07.996 --> 38:10.916
if there are many more
back home like you...

38:10.999 --> 38:14.336
God help anyone who goes
to war with America.

38:19.967 --> 38:21.844
Atten-hut!

38:21.927 --> 38:24.429
Attention on deck!
Admiral Kimmel...

38:24.513 --> 38:26.807
Commander-in-Chief,
Pacific Fleet, on deck.

38:26.890 --> 38:28.058
Sharp presentation, Captain.

38:28.183 --> 38:29.852
Thank you, Admiral Kimmel.

38:29.977 --> 38:32.771
For four months now Washington's
been blowing pink smoke...

38:32.855 --> 38:34.398
about the threat from Japan.

38:34.523 --> 38:35.983
Could make us lose
our fighting edge.

38:36.108 --> 38:37.734
I'm determined
not to let that happen.

38:44.533 --> 38:45.701
With your permission, Captain.

38:45.784 --> 38:48.787
Admiral, urgent,
from Washington.

38:52.916 --> 38:54.668
I'm supposed
to keep this fleet...

38:54.710 --> 38:56.503
battle-ready
to take on the Japanese...

38:56.545 --> 38:58.797
cover half the damn globe.

38:58.881 --> 39:00.382
Now they want me to transfer...

39:00.465 --> 39:01.884
another twelve destroyers
to the Atlantic.

39:01.967 --> 39:03.468
Don't they know what
we're facing out here?

39:03.552 --> 39:05.512
They feel Europe
is the greater danger.

39:05.554 --> 39:08.557
I'm assuming these risk
assessments include Hawaii?

39:08.599 --> 39:11.685
Pearl Harbor is too shallow
for an aerial torpedo attack.

39:11.768 --> 39:13.145
We're surrounded by sub nets.

39:13.228 --> 39:15.355
All we need worry
about is sabotage...

39:15.439 --> 39:17.024
so we bunched
our planes together...

39:17.107 --> 39:18.775
to make them easier to protect.

39:18.859 --> 39:20.944
Distance is our ally, Admiral.

39:21.028 --> 39:25.032
You analysts got it
all figured out, don't you?

39:25.115 --> 39:27.409
The smart enemy hits you...

39:27.493 --> 39:29.203
exactly where
you think you're safe.

40:39.648 --> 40:41.984
Incoming!

40:52.536 --> 40:54.872
I fixed the hydraulics
and electrics, sir...

40:54.955 --> 40:56.874
but the oil hoses
still need attention.

40:56.957 --> 40:58.083
Just crank it, Ian!

40:58.167 --> 40:59.459
God speed you, sir.

41:08.844 --> 41:10.137
Red section, take the bombers.

41:10.179 --> 41:12.681
Blue section,
look out for the fighters.

41:12.764 --> 41:14.474
Bombers dead ahead.

41:14.558 --> 41:16.727
Let's drop in
and give 'em a reception.

41:19.771 --> 41:22.149
Red Two, follow my lead,
high side.

41:22.191 --> 41:23.525
Go right at the lead bomber.

41:23.609 --> 41:24.735
Following you, Red One.

41:32.826 --> 41:33.994
Good hit! Good hit!

41:38.957 --> 41:40.959
Red One, coming around,
reset for the kill.

41:43.545 --> 41:44.713
I have the middle bomber.

41:49.051 --> 41:50.177
Hammer down!

41:55.224 --> 41:57.809
We got him.
Nice shot, Red Two.

41:57.893 --> 42:00.354
I got two M.E.s dead ahead.

42:05.317 --> 42:07.611
I'm on him.
I'm on his tail.

42:07.694 --> 42:09.196
Hammer down.

42:11.448 --> 42:13.242
I got one of them!

42:24.920 --> 42:26.171
I got another one.

42:26.255 --> 42:28.715
Red One, you got fighters
all over your tail!

42:29.925 --> 42:31.468
I'm under fire!
I'm taking fire!

42:34.596 --> 42:37.683
Red One, get out of there.
Pull up! Pull up!

42:42.938 --> 42:45.399
Argh! I got an oil leak.

42:49.319 --> 42:51.113
Can't see a damn thing!

42:53.532 --> 42:56.034
I can't bail!
My canopy's stuck!

42:56.160 --> 42:57.744
I can't bail out!

43:07.421 --> 43:08.922
He's on my tail, Red Two.

43:12.801 --> 43:14.803
I'm hit! I'm hit!

43:22.811 --> 43:24.813
Mayday! Mayday!

43:29.526 --> 43:31.612
Oh, my God.

43:45.501 --> 43:46.835
I'm no good at church.

43:46.919 --> 43:48.128
What do you mean, sweetie?

43:48.170 --> 43:51.590
When I'm up there getting
my slate wiped clean...

43:51.673 --> 43:54.510
I'm thinking how
to dirty it up again.

43:54.593 --> 43:55.719
Wow, this from a virgin!

43:55.802 --> 43:57.638
I got to inventory supplies.

43:57.721 --> 43:59.598
Kill me now.

43:59.681 --> 44:01.517
Could you be any more boring?

44:01.642 --> 44:03.936
Don't bother.
Sunday, she writes Rafe...

44:04.019 --> 44:06.438
ten pages instead
of the usual five.

44:07.731 --> 44:09.525
Gosh, I wish I was in love.

44:11.985 --> 44:13.737
Hey, sweetheart.

44:15.072 --> 44:16.281
She hates me.

44:17.533 --> 44:18.742
Good to see you, Red.

44:18.826 --> 44:21.286
Good to see you, too, Betty.

44:21.370 --> 44:22.871
You wanna come for a ride?

44:22.913 --> 44:24.373
Come on.

44:24.414 --> 44:26.667
Yeah, I'll be your chauffeur.

44:38.554 --> 44:39.888
That-a-boy! Be a mad dog!

44:39.972 --> 44:43.392
You hit pretty hard...
for a cook.

44:45.519 --> 44:47.688
All right, Walker,
who you got?

44:47.771 --> 44:49.481
I'll take the cook.

44:49.565 --> 44:50.774
Why? You don't like money?

44:53.735 --> 44:55.487
Come on! Get out there now!

44:58.907 --> 45:01.368
- I'll put five on it.
- Done.

45:02.786 --> 45:04.163
Against a mechanic?

45:04.246 --> 45:06.081
That guy craps rivets.

45:06.206 --> 45:07.416
How's it feel up
from the engine room?

45:07.541 --> 45:08.792
Sunlight botherin' you?

45:10.085 --> 45:11.211
Ow.

45:12.754 --> 45:14.298
Man, he's getting all busted up!

45:15.632 --> 45:17.009
Move! Move!

45:18.552 --> 45:20.053
Come here, we gotta talk.

45:20.137 --> 45:21.513
Get down here.

45:21.597 --> 45:22.806
He can't hurt us.

45:22.890 --> 45:24.933
He can hurt us.

45:25.017 --> 45:27.352
- He cut us. We bleeding.
- Bleeding?

45:27.436 --> 45:30.230
That's a scratch. See this?

45:30.272 --> 45:31.690
This is the hard-earned
greenbacks...

45:31.773 --> 45:34.234
of every pot-scrubbin'
chop in this fleet.

45:34.318 --> 45:35.777
Now if we don't win...

45:35.861 --> 45:38.113
Teeny here has to find
another battleship!

45:38.197 --> 45:40.407
I'm not going back
to the Arizona empty-handed.

45:40.532 --> 45:43.160
Don't worry about the money.

45:43.285 --> 45:46.580
I'll send that
smug engine-fixin' snipe...

45:46.622 --> 45:48.123
back below decks where he belong.

45:49.458 --> 45:51.084
We the man!

45:51.168 --> 45:53.420
He slapped your mama!
Be a son of a bitch!

46:02.346 --> 46:03.680
Look at this!
All right, Dorie!

46:16.860 --> 46:19.238
That's enough. That's enough.

46:22.991 --> 46:26.578
- Oh! Where's my money?
- Nah, fight's rigged.

46:26.662 --> 46:29.122
We're rich! Ha ha ha!

46:31.792 --> 46:32.960
How'd you get this?

46:33.001 --> 46:35.128
Boxing.

46:35.170 --> 46:36.713
Did you win?

46:36.797 --> 46:38.632
Yes, ma'am.

46:38.715 --> 46:42.553
What do you get for winning?

46:42.636 --> 46:44.221
Respect.

46:49.017 --> 46:53.480
So, why do you have to fight
with your fists to get respect?

46:53.605 --> 46:55.816
I left my momma in Texas...

46:55.858 --> 46:57.943
and joined the Navy
to see the world...

46:58.026 --> 47:00.112
become a man.

47:00.195 --> 47:02.948
They made me a cook.

47:03.031 --> 47:04.241
Not even that.

47:04.324 --> 47:07.411
I clean up after
other sailors eat.

47:07.494 --> 47:12.791
Two years, they never even
let me fire a weapon.

47:12.875 --> 47:15.586
Well, let's hope
you never have to.

47:16.837 --> 47:18.088
Yes, ma'am.

47:18.172 --> 47:20.007
You take care,
Petty Officer Miller.

47:20.090 --> 47:21.675
You, too, ma'am.

48:04.801 --> 48:08.096
You know,
he taught me to fly.

48:08.180 --> 48:10.891
I always knew that no matter
what trouble I got into...

48:10.974 --> 48:13.519
I'd never be in it alone.

48:13.602 --> 48:18.023
He'd be there with me.

48:18.106 --> 48:21.652
He was always pushing me
to be better and faster.

48:23.821 --> 48:26.657
He told me
you were a great flier.

48:27.783 --> 48:29.576
It was the same night
he told me...

48:29.660 --> 48:31.662
he'd volunteered
to go to England.

48:33.747 --> 48:36.625
Volunteered?

48:36.708 --> 48:41.255
He... he told me
he'd been assigned.

48:45.217 --> 48:48.428
He was always
trying to protect me.

48:51.932 --> 48:53.433
But you know what?

48:53.517 --> 48:56.270
I look at myself in
the mirror in this uniform...

48:56.311 --> 48:59.690
and I still
don't know who I am.

48:59.815 --> 49:03.068
I look like a hero...

49:03.152 --> 49:05.779
but I don't feel like it.

49:07.656 --> 49:10.909
Rafe...

49:10.993 --> 49:14.621
he always looked the part,
didn't he?

49:14.705 --> 49:16.915
He couldn't wait to be one.

49:39.938 --> 49:42.900
To Rafe McCawley.

49:43.025 --> 49:46.487
The best pilot...

49:46.570 --> 49:50.324
and the best friend
I ever knew...

49:50.365 --> 49:51.950
or ever will know.

49:56.205 --> 49:57.831
To Rafe.

51:04.273 --> 51:05.732
THUR Look at this.
The Japanese...

51:05.774 --> 51:07.860
are flooding the Pacific
with radio traffic.

51:07.943 --> 51:11.321
Everywhere from the Panama Canal
to southeast Asia.

51:11.405 --> 51:12.865
There's no logical pattern,
Captain.

51:12.990 --> 51:14.408
No. There's always logic.

51:14.491 --> 51:16.743
They know we read their mail.

51:16.827 --> 51:21.039
They're trying to make us think
their fleet is moving south.

51:21.123 --> 51:22.916
I'm not buying it.

51:22.958 --> 51:26.003
Something, something's up.

51:26.086 --> 51:29.882
Otherwise, why would they take
the trouble to bullshit me?

51:44.354 --> 51:48.817
Evelyn, I signed for
these letters for you today.

51:48.942 --> 51:51.361
They're from England.

51:51.445 --> 51:53.030
They're from Rafe.

51:53.155 --> 51:55.115
I'm sorry, Ev.

51:55.157 --> 51:57.910
You know how long
it takes mail to get here.

52:11.507 --> 52:12.633
Hurry up!

52:12.716 --> 52:14.301
Show time, boys! Come on!

52:17.679 --> 52:20.015
America still
awaits Japan's response...

52:20.140 --> 52:21.517
to peace proposals.

52:21.600 --> 52:24.061
Ambassador Nomura
arrives in Washington...

52:24.144 --> 52:25.687
in what could
hopefully guarantee...

52:25.813 --> 52:28.106
continued peace in the Pacific.

52:28.190 --> 52:30.567
On the British front,
Churchill declares...

52:30.651 --> 52:33.695
"Give us the tools,
and we will finish the job. "

52:35.989 --> 52:38.367
The RAF has fought
bravely against...

52:38.450 --> 52:43.330
Hitler's ambition to rule
the skies over the Channel.

52:43.372 --> 52:46.875
Victory does not come
without sacrifice.

52:49.211 --> 52:50.337
Evelyn!

52:50.420 --> 52:51.839
- Danny.
- Hey.

52:51.880 --> 52:53.799
Some comedy, huh?

52:54.883 --> 52:56.885
Yeah.

52:57.010 --> 52:58.971
It's been a while.

52:59.054 --> 53:01.557
I've been logging
a lot of flight hours.

53:01.682 --> 53:04.518
I kinda been avoiding you, too.

53:04.560 --> 53:06.311
Yeah.

53:06.395 --> 53:08.564
- Look-
- Do you-

53:08.647 --> 53:09.857
Do you want to?

53:09.898 --> 53:12.025
Sure, yeah.

53:12.067 --> 53:14.069
I remember
one time when I was...

53:14.111 --> 53:15.654
like, seven years old...

53:15.737 --> 53:18.115
I was always building
gadgets and things.

53:18.198 --> 53:20.242
He wanted me
to build him some wings...

53:20.325 --> 53:22.161
so he could fly like his daddy.

53:22.244 --> 53:25.372
I told him you can't fly
without some kind of engine.

53:25.414 --> 53:27.040
But he wouldn't listen.

53:27.124 --> 53:29.585
"Danny, never mind that,
just build 'em anyway. "

53:29.668 --> 53:31.837
So I did.

53:31.920 --> 53:33.547
And I'm up there...

53:33.630 --> 53:35.591
strapping these big ol' wings
on his back...

53:35.716 --> 53:37.551
that we made
from paper and glue...

53:37.593 --> 53:39.970
and these massive silk bloomers
that we stole.

53:40.053 --> 53:42.472
He looked so stupid,
and I told him...

53:42.556 --> 53:44.892
"You can't jump off the barn
in these. "

53:44.933 --> 53:46.643
And bam!

53:46.727 --> 53:49.354
He busted his leg on a backhoe.

53:54.526 --> 53:55.903
God, I miss him.

53:55.986 --> 53:59.114
Yeah. But don't you think...

53:59.198 --> 54:01.283
that Rafe wasn't
back up there next day.

54:01.408 --> 54:02.701
Cast and everything...

54:02.784 --> 54:06.538
telling me to make some
adjustments on those wings.

54:06.622 --> 54:08.081
Check this out!

54:08.165 --> 54:09.958
Crossroads of the Pacific.

54:10.042 --> 54:12.961
Tahiti-1,700 miles!

54:13.045 --> 54:15.255
All right!

54:15.297 --> 54:17.549
Say, Betty...

54:22.679 --> 54:25.307
W- wou...

54:26.475 --> 54:28.519
- No, Betty! Get up!
- What's going on, Red?

54:28.602 --> 54:31.480
- Stand up, please.
- What do you mean?

54:31.563 --> 54:33.357
Just stand up.

54:33.482 --> 54:35.442
Stand...

54:35.526 --> 54:37.945
Oh! Ha!

54:38.028 --> 54:39.613
Betty...

54:39.696 --> 54:40.781
Red, come on!

54:40.906 --> 54:43.534
We got a dinner reservation.

54:45.327 --> 54:46.954
Can I get a minute?

54:48.956 --> 54:50.415
What's the matter, you sick?

54:52.125 --> 54:53.752
Can a guy propose?!

54:55.587 --> 54:57.422
Oh! Thank you!

54:57.506 --> 54:59.299
Am I talking too much?

54:59.383 --> 55:01.969
Sometimes I do that, I'm sorry.

55:04.096 --> 55:05.264
Hold up!

55:05.347 --> 55:06.974
Look at this.

55:07.057 --> 55:08.600
Hello!

55:08.684 --> 55:11.186
OK, let's get out of here.

55:11.270 --> 55:12.437
OK.

55:15.149 --> 55:17.568
I guess I should go.

55:17.651 --> 55:20.320
Don't let it be three months
before I see you again.

55:20.404 --> 55:21.738
I had a good time.

55:21.822 --> 55:23.073
Yeah, me, too.

55:24.658 --> 55:26.493
Do you want me
to walk you home?

55:26.535 --> 55:28.162
No, I'll be fine.

55:28.203 --> 55:30.122
No... of course.

55:30.205 --> 55:32.332
- Good night.
- Good night.

55:44.303 --> 55:47.556
I was just wondering if maybe
I could come by some time...

55:47.639 --> 55:50.350
get a cup of coffee
or a piece of pie?

55:50.434 --> 55:53.145
What am I doing?

55:54.438 --> 55:56.023
OK.

55:59.485 --> 56:01.570
Oh! You were asleep. I'm sorry.

56:01.653 --> 56:03.363
Danny?

56:03.447 --> 56:04.698
Is something wrong?

56:04.781 --> 56:06.867
No! Nothing's wrong.
No problem. Hi!

56:06.909 --> 56:09.495
It's just Danny.

56:09.578 --> 56:11.497
I... just... you...

56:11.580 --> 56:13.665
you forgot this.

56:13.749 --> 56:17.878
Oh... thanks.

56:18.003 --> 56:19.838
It was good of you
to take the trouble...

56:19.922 --> 56:21.882
to drop it over... now.

56:22.007 --> 56:24.384
I... well, I thought
you might need it.

56:24.426 --> 56:27.304
You know...
maybe tomorrow morning.

56:27.387 --> 56:28.555
If...

56:28.597 --> 56:30.349
not that you wear this
to work, but...

56:30.432 --> 56:32.392
No... it's a hankie.

56:34.394 --> 56:37.648
Right, right. Yeah.

56:39.441 --> 56:44.321
Listen, I was thinking maybe...
I could come by some time...

56:44.404 --> 56:47.032
if I gave you a call,
could I come by?

56:48.826 --> 56:51.870
Once, maybe...
if you're not busy?

56:53.038 --> 56:54.206
Yeah, maybe.

56:54.289 --> 56:56.792
- Maybe?
- Maybe.

56:56.834 --> 56:58.085
OK, all right.

56:58.126 --> 57:00.003
Thanks.

57:00.087 --> 57:01.255
Good-bye. Good night.

57:01.296 --> 57:02.840
You are such an idiot!

57:08.220 --> 57:09.555
Did you have fun last night?

57:10.639 --> 57:12.057
It wasn't how it looked.

57:12.140 --> 57:13.976
And if it was,
it'd be all right.

57:14.059 --> 57:16.061
It's been months.
It's time to move on.

57:16.145 --> 57:17.896
I am moving on.

57:17.980 --> 57:19.481
Ev, don't lie.

57:19.565 --> 57:22.067
All I know is, I hear you crying
when you think I'm asleep.

57:22.192 --> 57:24.153
When my dad left...

57:24.278 --> 57:26.405
I was too much
for my mom to handle...

57:26.488 --> 57:28.448
so she sent me
to live with my aunt.

57:28.490 --> 57:30.492
I thought my life was over...

57:30.576 --> 57:33.078
But you don't know
where it's all gonna lead.

57:33.162 --> 57:35.414
If I hadn't run away
and lied about my age...

57:35.497 --> 57:36.748
and enlisted in the Navy...

57:36.832 --> 57:39.459
I wouldn't have met Red, and...

57:39.501 --> 57:41.295
now he's my fiance.

57:43.338 --> 57:45.591
Oh, God, I can't
get used to that word.

57:45.674 --> 57:47.801
- It's only been twelve hours.
- Oh, Betty!

57:47.843 --> 57:49.595
Little Betty
beat us all to the post.

57:49.678 --> 57:50.846
And this is ward three.

57:50.929 --> 57:53.432
As you can see, no patients.

57:53.515 --> 57:55.809
Welcome to Hawaii.
Come on, I'll show you the bar.

57:55.893 --> 57:57.978
Sandra, new recruits to torture.

57:58.061 --> 57:59.855
Come on. Excuse me, ladies?

57:59.938 --> 58:01.106
Hi!

58:02.941 --> 58:04.693
We're gonna wait two years
until I'm nineteen...

58:04.776 --> 58:06.320
and Red can buy me a ring.

58:08.447 --> 58:11.033
Rafe sent his best friend
to tell you...

58:11.116 --> 58:14.119
so you would be OK,
so you can move on.

58:15.704 --> 58:17.456
You gotta go on living, Ev.

58:24.546 --> 58:25.797
Red!

58:26.965 --> 58:28.884
Whoo! Sorry!

58:45.150 --> 58:47.653
Bye, Rafe.

58:49.780 --> 58:52.032
The Japanese Fleet is missing.

58:52.074 --> 58:54.952
They're operating
under radio silence.

58:55.035 --> 58:59.581
This footage was shot
four days ago on October 28th.

59:02.709 --> 59:05.587
We're sending
scout planes in wider vectors...

59:05.671 --> 59:08.090
all over the Pacific,
but they get nothing.

59:08.173 --> 59:10.384
They could be anywhere in here.

59:10.425 --> 59:13.554
I don't understand how
two whole carrier divisions...

59:13.595 --> 59:16.098
can just disappear.

59:21.687 --> 59:22.980
Clear!

59:32.114 --> 59:34.199
Aw, we're all over the page.

59:34.283 --> 59:36.076
We got one wall-eyed
and one pigeon-toed.

59:36.160 --> 59:38.787
Anthony, tap in number six.
All right.

59:38.912 --> 59:40.831
Gooz, tap in number three.

59:40.914 --> 59:42.166
All right.

59:42.249 --> 59:45.210
Hey. We got a visitor.

59:45.294 --> 59:48.213
Oh... that ain't
no Navy issue uniform, eh?

59:48.297 --> 59:50.048
Danny, it's Evelyn.

59:50.132 --> 59:51.592
Jesus!

59:51.675 --> 59:54.219
You alright?

59:54.303 --> 59:56.221
Yeah. Yeah.

59:56.305 --> 59:57.890
No.

59:57.973 --> 01:00:00.434
I think I'm fallin' for her.

01:00:00.517 --> 01:00:02.269
Wow. You know,
I saw this coming.

01:00:03.729 --> 01:00:05.272
I didn't want this to happen.

01:00:05.355 --> 01:00:07.357
It just kind of did.
Can't help it.

01:00:07.483 --> 01:00:08.984
Well, Danny,
she's gotta be with somebody.

01:00:09.109 --> 01:00:10.569
It might as well be you.

01:00:10.652 --> 01:00:11.862
You telling me
if you were dead...

01:00:11.987 --> 01:00:13.906
and you saw your best buddy
doin' your girl...

01:00:13.989 --> 01:00:16.533
you wouldn't come back and beat
the living crap outta him?

01:00:16.617 --> 01:00:19.036
- Tony, back off.
- I'd be back so fast.

01:00:19.119 --> 01:00:21.788
Danny's being a better friend
taking care of her himself.

01:00:21.872 --> 01:00:23.790
I got a girlfriend.

01:00:28.045 --> 01:00:29.421
That's great.

01:00:29.505 --> 01:00:31.798
Come on, fellas.
Let's split.

01:00:31.882 --> 01:00:35.135
Danny, whatever happens now
is just about you and her.

01:00:35.219 --> 01:00:37.304
You gotta try
and forget about Rafe.

01:00:37.346 --> 01:00:39.473
Be careful, alright?

01:00:39.515 --> 01:00:42.601
Ladies... cloud the mind.

01:00:42.684 --> 01:00:45.687
- Thanks, Gooz.
- You're welcome.

01:00:46.730 --> 01:00:48.482
Hey, Danny.

01:00:51.026 --> 01:00:52.528
Where's everybody going?

01:00:54.822 --> 01:00:56.698
Just bein' discreet.

01:00:56.782 --> 01:00:58.659
Does it seem like everybody's
acting a little strange?

01:00:58.700 --> 01:01:00.452
No. Nah.

01:01:00.536 --> 01:01:01.829
Right.

01:01:04.289 --> 01:01:06.625
Well, maybe-maybe a little.
Yeah.

01:01:06.708 --> 01:01:08.669
Well, people in this outfit...

01:01:08.752 --> 01:01:10.838
have way too much time
on their hands.

01:01:10.921 --> 01:01:12.214
Oh, yeah.

01:01:12.297 --> 01:01:13.507
I just hope they don't think
there's been something...

01:01:13.590 --> 01:01:14.883
goin' on between us,
that's all.

01:01:15.008 --> 01:01:17.386
Oh, no. I mean, no.
That would be...

01:01:17.469 --> 01:01:18.846
embarrassing, right?

01:01:18.887 --> 01:01:20.389
Forgot my wrenches.

01:01:20.514 --> 01:01:21.974
That would definitely
be embarrassing.

01:01:22.099 --> 01:01:23.433
Yeah.

01:01:23.517 --> 01:01:25.686
Ha. Forgot my wrenches.

01:01:25.769 --> 01:01:28.897
Hey. He really
doesn't have to leave.

01:01:28.981 --> 01:01:30.482
No.

01:01:30.566 --> 01:01:34.486
I, uh, I'm just goin'
out with the girls, so...

01:01:34.570 --> 01:01:37.406
I guess I'll see you later.

01:01:37.489 --> 01:01:39.700
- Yeah.
- All right.

01:01:39.783 --> 01:01:41.535
Yeah, all right.
I'll see you around.

01:01:42.953 --> 01:01:44.204
Shit.

01:01:45.164 --> 01:01:47.207
Evelyn.

01:01:47.332 --> 01:01:49.334
Have you ever seen
Pearl Harbor at sunset?

01:01:49.459 --> 01:01:51.378
Of course.

01:01:51.420 --> 01:01:53.797
Well... from the air?

01:01:57.759 --> 01:02:00.554
You know, I could get kicked
out of the military for this.

01:02:00.637 --> 01:02:03.056
- Really?
- Yeah. Stay down.

01:02:22.493 --> 01:02:24.912
The Hawaiians called
this harbor Wai Momi.

01:02:24.995 --> 01:02:26.788
It means "water of pearls. "

01:02:26.872 --> 01:02:28.499
It's so beautiful.

01:02:28.582 --> 01:02:31.251
My dad took me up
a couple of times.

01:02:31.335 --> 01:02:32.711
Just don't do what he did.

01:02:32.794 --> 01:02:34.338
What do you call it
when you flip over?

01:02:34.421 --> 01:02:35.547
A barrelroll?

01:02:35.631 --> 01:02:36.882
Yeah.

01:02:36.965 --> 01:02:39.259
I won't.

01:02:39.301 --> 01:02:40.511
Aah!

01:02:46.642 --> 01:02:49.645
- Oh!
- Ha ha ha ha!

01:02:49.686 --> 01:02:52.439
- Oh, God.
- What do you think?

01:02:52.481 --> 01:02:54.149
I like that.

01:03:03.992 --> 01:03:05.327
Hey!

01:03:05.410 --> 01:03:07.663
That plane was supposed
to be back here an hour ago!

01:03:07.746 --> 01:03:09.748
Quick, hide
in the parachute hangar.

01:03:49.288 --> 01:03:51.665
My heart is pounding.

01:04:39.087 --> 01:04:41.215
Danny, last night...

01:04:41.298 --> 01:04:43.258
No, that's terrible.

01:04:45.260 --> 01:04:47.930
Danny, we need
to talk about this.

01:04:49.431 --> 01:04:51.391
Sir. Evelyn!

01:04:51.433 --> 01:04:53.894
- Danny.
- Hey. Hi.

01:04:55.270 --> 01:04:56.438
Hi.

01:04:58.440 --> 01:05:00.359
I didn't sleep a wink
last night.

01:05:00.442 --> 01:05:02.903
I had to see you.

01:05:02.986 --> 01:05:05.489
Last night was crazy,
I know, but...

01:05:05.572 --> 01:05:07.783
I'm not sorry. Are you?

01:05:09.952 --> 01:05:11.411
I don't know.

01:05:13.330 --> 01:05:17.292
Danny, I had a wonderful
time last night. I-

01:05:17.417 --> 01:05:18.961
It's just all too fast.

01:05:19.044 --> 01:05:21.630
Listen, Evelyn, I was just down
at the beach this morning...

01:05:21.713 --> 01:05:23.507
and I watched the sun rise...

01:05:23.590 --> 01:05:25.551
and I knew that everything
was gonna be different.

01:05:25.634 --> 01:05:29.221
That this was the start
of something new.

01:05:29.304 --> 01:05:32.224
In this place, in this moment.

01:05:32.307 --> 01:05:35.561
And I don't care what
anybody else says, you know?

01:05:35.644 --> 01:05:38.605
How can I not feel this way?

01:05:40.149 --> 01:05:41.984
I kinda like you.

01:05:44.862 --> 01:05:46.446
Oh, you do?

01:05:51.285 --> 01:05:53.245
You have your tie on crooked.

01:05:56.915 --> 01:05:59.793
Everything's
gonna be all right, OK?

01:06:01.211 --> 01:06:03.255
Everything's
gonna be all right.

01:06:11.972 --> 01:06:16.435
Do you have any airtours going
through the valley of Oahu?

01:06:17.561 --> 01:06:19.021
You do?

01:06:31.325 --> 01:06:34.328
Aloha.
This is KGMB in Honolulu...

01:06:34.411 --> 01:06:37.623
on another beautiful
fall day here in paradise.

01:06:41.460 --> 01:06:43.879
We have enough information.

01:06:45.964 --> 01:06:48.050
We are returning home.

01:07:16.829 --> 01:07:17.996
Do you ever wonder...

01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:19.873
if this war's
gonna catch up with us?

01:07:20.958 --> 01:07:23.377
Nota whole lot.

01:07:23.418 --> 01:07:27.548
Every moment we're not together,
you're up there training for it.

01:07:29.508 --> 01:07:32.719
Yeah, well, I'm training
for moments like these...

01:07:32.803 --> 01:07:34.388
'cause I have no idea...

01:07:34.471 --> 01:07:37.015
how I'm gonna get this car
out of the sand.

01:07:37.099 --> 01:07:38.559
Evelyn, can you please
come out of the bathroom?

01:07:38.642 --> 01:07:40.644
You've been there for an hour.

01:07:40.727 --> 01:07:43.230
Evelyn! What are you
trying to do, look like me?

01:07:45.691 --> 01:07:47.568
Are you OK?

01:07:47.651 --> 01:07:48.777
Yeah.

01:07:48.861 --> 01:07:50.362
What's the matter?
No, you-

01:07:50.445 --> 01:07:52.948
D'oy.

01:07:53.031 --> 01:07:54.908
They call it the vacant sea.

01:07:54.992 --> 01:07:56.952
None of the major sea lanes
go through it...

01:07:57.035 --> 01:07:59.913
and you can bury the entire
land mass of Asia there...

01:07:59.955 --> 01:08:01.832
and nobody would know.

01:08:01.915 --> 01:08:05.043
From there,
they could attack anywhere.

01:08:05.127 --> 01:08:06.587
Our last signals intercept...

01:08:06.628 --> 01:08:09.339
indicate that the Japanese
taskforce is heading south...

01:08:09.423 --> 01:08:11.216
towards the Philippines
or southeast Asia.

01:08:11.300 --> 01:08:13.594
But Captain Thurman
of Naval intelligence here...

01:08:13.635 --> 01:08:15.429
has his own theory
about the missing ships.

01:08:16.638 --> 01:08:19.099
Sir, I believe
they'll try to hit us...

01:08:19.140 --> 01:08:21.143
where it'll hurt us the most-
Pearl Harbor.

01:08:21.225 --> 01:08:24.229
It's over 4,000 nautical miles
from Japan to Pearl.

01:08:24.313 --> 01:08:28.609
That's a long distance
to steam a navy, Captain.

01:08:28.649 --> 01:08:30.944
Your theory is based on what?

01:08:30.986 --> 01:08:33.613
Well, it's what I would do.

01:08:33.697 --> 01:08:36.617
That's not exactly
hard evidence, Captain Thurman.

01:08:36.658 --> 01:08:38.076
Well, Admiral,
if I had hard evidence...

01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:39.495
we'd already be at war.

01:08:39.578 --> 01:08:41.287
Sir, we can read
their diplomatic codes...

01:08:41.330 --> 01:08:42.622
faster than they can type them.

01:08:42.706 --> 01:08:44.291
But Captain Thurman's
cryptology team...

01:08:44.374 --> 01:08:46.126
is still trying
to crack the naval codes.

01:08:46.210 --> 01:08:49.087
The intercepts have missing
words and garbled lines...

01:08:49.171 --> 01:08:52.883
so to explain the decrypts,
we have to try to interpret...

01:08:53.008 --> 01:08:54.051
what we think
they're trying to do.

01:08:54.176 --> 01:08:57.304
Interpret?
You mean guess.

01:08:57.345 --> 01:08:59.848
They use
their informed intuition, sir.

01:08:59.932 --> 01:09:02.309
We guess.

01:09:02.350 --> 01:09:03.810
It's like playing chess
in the dark.

01:09:03.852 --> 01:09:06.479
Any rumor, troop movement,
ship movement...

01:09:06.563 --> 01:09:08.816
spine-tingle, goose bump,
we pay attention to it.

01:09:08.899 --> 01:09:10.818
When I was in
the Asiatic Fleet...

01:09:10.859 --> 01:09:13.028
the locals used to try
to get outside of a problem...

01:09:13.111 --> 01:09:14.488
to try to see the inside.

01:09:14.571 --> 01:09:16.113
Well, I see a strike on Pearl.

01:09:16.198 --> 01:09:17.783
It's the worst thing
that could happen.

01:09:17.866 --> 01:09:18.992
A blow to Pearl
would devastate...

01:09:19.033 --> 01:09:21.370
the Pacific Fleet's
ability to make war.

01:09:21.495 --> 01:09:24.706
So, sir, you would have us
mobilize the entire fleet...

01:09:24.832 --> 01:09:27.792
at the cost
of millions of dollars...

01:09:27.876 --> 01:09:30.254
based on this spine-tingling
feeling of yours?

01:09:30.337 --> 01:09:34.174
No, sir. My job is to gather
and interpret material.

01:09:34.258 --> 01:09:36.426
Making difficult decisions...

01:09:36.510 --> 01:09:37.970
based on
incomplete information...

01:09:38.053 --> 01:09:40.848
from my limited
decoding ability...

01:09:40.889 --> 01:09:43.350
is your job, sir.

01:09:43.392 --> 01:09:45.810
Then break the damn naval code,
Captain...

01:09:45.894 --> 01:09:47.645
so I can make a better decision.

01:09:47.729 --> 01:09:50.691
Aye, sir. We are trying.

01:10:07.875 --> 01:10:10.627
I wonder if we shouldn't put
the Pacific Fleet on full alert.

01:10:17.009 --> 01:10:18.135
In case the optimism...

01:10:18.218 --> 01:10:21.096
of the "Honolulu Advertiser"
proves unfounded, gentlemen...

01:10:22.181 --> 01:10:23.432
what are General Short
and the Army...

01:10:23.515 --> 01:10:25.267
going to do
about protecting my ships?

01:10:25.350 --> 01:10:27.811
Within a ten-mile radius
of your harbor...

01:10:27.936 --> 01:10:29.771
we have fighterplanes
here at Wheeler...

01:10:29.897 --> 01:10:32.107
bombers at Hickam, and
a trainingstrip at Haleiwa.

01:10:42.493 --> 01:10:43.952
We've recently established
a radar station here...

01:10:44.036 --> 01:10:47.080
that can detect planes
125 miles out.

01:10:47.164 --> 01:10:49.416
Which is a month old, Admiral,
and untested.

01:10:49.500 --> 01:10:52.252
I've seen
these new radar screens, Major.

01:10:52.294 --> 01:10:53.879
There's no way of telling
whether they're ours, theirs...

01:10:53.962 --> 01:10:55.631
or a flock of damn birds.

01:10:57.883 --> 01:10:59.468
I'm intercepting
a call from Tokyo...

01:10:59.551 --> 01:11:01.595
to somewhere close by Pearl.

01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:03.096
There's a call from Tokyo.

01:11:03.180 --> 01:11:04.473
They say they don't know you.

01:11:06.642 --> 01:11:08.769
Hello? Hai.

01:11:15.234 --> 01:11:16.902
It's a local dentist.

01:11:16.985 --> 01:11:19.696
He can see Pearl Harbor
from his office.

01:11:19.780 --> 01:11:21.782
Are there many sailors around?

01:11:26.829 --> 01:11:29.289
Uh, the dentist
says that the flatships...

01:11:29.331 --> 01:11:31.083
are not in port.

01:11:31.166 --> 01:11:33.836
They're talking about
the weather.

01:11:33.919 --> 01:11:36.088
He doesn't seem to know
who he's talking to.

01:11:36.171 --> 01:11:37.840
Hello?

01:11:37.965 --> 01:11:40.092
Hello? Moshi moshi.

01:11:40.175 --> 01:11:41.885
Hello?

01:11:41.969 --> 01:11:44.304
That was a strange call.

01:11:46.598 --> 01:11:48.308
Admiral,
may I speak to you in private?

01:11:49.810 --> 01:11:51.353
Why would a spy use a phone?

01:11:51.436 --> 01:11:53.063
They know we tap
all international lines.

01:11:53.147 --> 01:11:55.315
Our listeners feel
it's probably not code talk.

01:11:55.399 --> 01:11:57.067
It sounds like someone in Japan
is sneaking around...

01:11:57.151 --> 01:11:59.278
asking a local citizen
the location of our carriers.

01:11:59.361 --> 01:12:01.655
Well, that makes me feel
all warm inside.

01:12:01.738 --> 01:12:04.533
Get the FBI on it immediately.

01:12:04.616 --> 01:12:06.869
Have we found
the goddamn Japanese Fleet yet?

01:12:06.952 --> 01:12:09.454
No, Admiral. The bases are
looking all over the Pacific.

01:12:09.580 --> 01:12:11.498
So the entire fleet could be
rounding Diamond Head...

01:12:11.540 --> 01:12:13.542
and we wouldn't know
a thing about it.

01:12:13.667 --> 01:12:14.793
Get on it.

01:12:49.328 --> 01:12:51.288
I'm alive.

01:12:51.413 --> 01:12:53.540
This is the first
I could get word out.

01:13:30.577 --> 01:13:33.163
Jepense qu'il est mort!

01:13:34.456 --> 01:13:36.458
ll estencore en vie.

01:13:53.642 --> 01:13:55.686
I told you I'd come back.

01:13:59.189 --> 01:14:01.316
Here, sit down.
Sit down. Come here.

01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:03.902
It's OK.

01:14:03.986 --> 01:14:05.946
It's all right.

01:14:08.615 --> 01:14:09.950
You're real.

01:14:10.033 --> 01:14:11.827
Yeah.

01:14:13.328 --> 01:14:14.955
I wished for this every day.

01:14:14.997 --> 01:14:16.290
I know. Me, too.

01:14:16.373 --> 01:14:18.959
Every second. So did I.

01:14:19.042 --> 01:14:21.253
I thought you were dead.

01:14:21.336 --> 01:14:23.130
They said you were shot down
in the sea.

01:14:23.255 --> 01:14:25.340
Yeah, I was.

01:14:25.465 --> 01:14:28.385
I was in the ocean.
It was so cold.

01:14:28.468 --> 01:14:30.679
I missed you.

01:14:30.762 --> 01:14:33.849
I got picked up
by a French fishing boat...

01:14:33.932 --> 01:14:36.894
and I was in occupied France,
and I couldn't get word out.

01:14:36.977 --> 01:14:39.313
And I'm just-I'll tell you
all about it, I promise.

01:14:39.354 --> 01:14:41.148
But I'm fine. I'm OK.

01:14:41.231 --> 01:14:42.733
And I'm here now.

01:14:42.816 --> 01:14:44.067
Evelyn...

01:14:44.151 --> 01:14:46.278
I just wanted to see you.

01:14:46.361 --> 01:14:49.198
You're so beautiful.

01:15:04.588 --> 01:15:06.256
I love you.

01:15:10.260 --> 01:15:13.347
Hey, it's OK. It's OK.

01:15:13.430 --> 01:15:15.224
Evelyn, Evelyn. I'm back.

01:15:16.558 --> 01:15:19.853
It's OK. I won't leave you
again, I promise.

01:15:21.063 --> 01:15:22.523
Rafe, you died.

01:15:25.692 --> 01:15:27.402
And so did I.

01:15:27.486 --> 01:15:31.448
I know, but I'm-I'm-
It's fine now. I'm back.

01:15:32.574 --> 01:15:33.742
We're together.

01:15:40.666 --> 01:15:43.043
I mean, we are together...

01:15:43.126 --> 01:15:44.378
right?

01:15:47.130 --> 01:15:49.216
I don't know where I am.

01:15:52.719 --> 01:15:54.388
Rafe.

01:16:22.958 --> 01:16:24.251
Rafe.

01:16:28.172 --> 01:16:29.965
Stay away.

01:16:33.010 --> 01:16:34.136
Rafe.

01:16:36.889 --> 01:16:38.849
This is Radio Honolulu...

01:16:38.974 --> 01:16:40.267
playing the sweetest music...

01:16:40.350 --> 01:16:43.228
on the sweetest island
in the Pacific.

01:16:43.312 --> 01:16:45.397
It's a beautiful
December 6th...

01:16:45.481 --> 01:16:47.274
with beautiful music...

01:16:58.952 --> 01:17:00.370
Raaaaafe!

01:17:00.454 --> 01:17:02.498
Oh, Goddamnit.
There you go.

01:17:02.581 --> 01:17:04.666
A real live ace!

01:17:04.750 --> 01:17:05.959
Whoo!

01:17:06.001 --> 01:17:08.629
An ace is only five.
I shot down six M.E.s.

01:17:08.754 --> 01:17:11.340
And I got two smokers, too.
They don't count them.

01:17:11.465 --> 01:17:13.884
Of course, I got shot down
myself before they could pin me.

01:17:13.967 --> 01:17:15.928
So you got back
from behind enemy lines, huh?

01:17:15.969 --> 01:17:18.222
What's that combat like?
Were you scared?

01:17:18.305 --> 01:17:21.517
Hey! One at a time.

01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:23.602
Well, them Luftwaffe boys
can fly pretty good.

01:17:23.685 --> 01:17:25.270
It's not like,
you know, training.

01:17:25.354 --> 01:17:26.480
They're, uh...

01:17:30.567 --> 01:17:31.985
Danny.

01:17:32.069 --> 01:17:33.862
You know, they're all about
tactics is what it is.

01:17:33.946 --> 01:17:35.823
See, the Nazis, right,
they're faster than you are...

01:17:35.906 --> 01:17:37.783
so they'll disappear and
they get up in the soup...

01:17:37.825 --> 01:17:39.284
and they'll throw like
a roll or a hammerhead...

01:17:39.368 --> 01:17:41.578
and they'll come around
on your high side...

01:17:41.662 --> 01:17:44.623
shoot you from behind-
like some Americans will.

01:17:49.795 --> 01:17:51.672
Hey...

01:17:51.713 --> 01:17:54.174
Gooz, you're lookin'
at a real live ace.

01:17:54.258 --> 01:17:56.593
Well, let me give you
the shirt off my back!

01:17:56.677 --> 01:17:58.303
Whoo!

01:17:58.387 --> 01:17:59.847
Aloha! There you go!

01:17:59.930 --> 01:18:01.306
I'll take it from you.

01:18:01.390 --> 01:18:03.350
I can see how y'all been
spending your time out here.

01:18:03.433 --> 01:18:04.852
Hey, Rafe,
we gotta talk, all right?

01:18:04.893 --> 01:18:07.771
I got nothin' to talk
about with you. Here.

01:18:09.398 --> 01:18:11.942
Why don't you have a drink?

01:18:12.025 --> 01:18:13.861
I'll make a toast.

01:18:13.902 --> 01:18:16.196
To returning from the dead.

01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:20.117
Wasn't all I expected,
but, well, that's life.

01:18:21.493 --> 01:18:23.829
To my best friend
and loyal buddy Danny...

01:18:23.871 --> 01:18:26.665
for keepin' up the war effort
back here at home.

01:18:30.335 --> 01:18:31.461
Ahh.

01:18:33.380 --> 01:18:34.506
You know, where I come from...

01:18:34.590 --> 01:18:36.091
somebody makes a toast to you
and you don't drink...

01:18:36.175 --> 01:18:37.634
that's sayin' something.

01:18:37.718 --> 01:18:40.679
All right, Rafe.

01:18:40.762 --> 01:18:43.348
That's how it's gonna be.

01:18:43.432 --> 01:18:44.933
To you.

01:18:45.017 --> 01:18:46.393
Hey, you guys need to spend
some time alone, I think.

01:18:46.477 --> 01:18:48.520
Aw, hell, no, Red.
Come on.

01:18:48.604 --> 01:18:51.148
No, no, no.
We're celebratin' here.

01:18:51.273 --> 01:18:53.275
Me over there fightin'...

01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:55.360
almost gettin' killed...

01:18:55.486 --> 01:18:57.279
my friend Danny back here...

01:18:57.362 --> 01:18:59.490
lookin' after my interests
for me.

01:18:59.573 --> 01:19:00.657
Y'all know Danny
was even good enough...

01:19:00.741 --> 01:19:03.202
to look out for my girl for me
while I was gone?

01:19:03.285 --> 01:19:06.038
We thought you were dead, Rafe.
And it gutted us both.

01:19:06.079 --> 01:19:08.790
And we were just tryin'
to get on with our lives.

01:19:08.874 --> 01:19:10.417
Life is good, ain't it, Danny?

01:19:10.501 --> 01:19:12.628
You know, you're a rotten drunk.
You always have been.

01:19:12.711 --> 01:19:15.839
Well, you're a lousy friend.
That's a new development.

01:19:17.633 --> 01:19:20.177
You left her to fight
somebody else's war...

01:19:20.260 --> 01:19:21.929
and you made damn sure
that I didn't go with you...

01:19:21.970 --> 01:19:23.472
and we thought
that you were dead-

01:19:23.555 --> 01:19:25.641
I almost did die,
you little son of a bitch!

01:19:25.766 --> 01:19:28.143
And her face was the last thing
that went through my mind...

01:19:28.227 --> 01:19:30.187
so don't stand there and tell
me to act like it's all right!

01:19:30.270 --> 01:19:32.439
Yeah, Rafe, well, I stayed.

01:19:32.481 --> 01:19:34.441
I stayed,
and you made sure of that...

01:19:34.483 --> 01:19:35.692
and some things changed.

01:19:35.776 --> 01:19:37.611
And I hope
you can get used to that.

01:19:37.653 --> 01:19:39.571
Oh, I have to get used to it?

01:19:39.655 --> 01:19:43.116
All right. We'll see
how I can get used to it.

01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:44.952
- Whoa!
- Hey!

01:19:45.035 --> 01:19:46.328
Get used to that, boy!

01:19:46.411 --> 01:19:47.913
Hey, hey!

01:19:47.996 --> 01:19:49.164
And that's my left hand, too!

01:19:49.248 --> 01:19:51.250
Hey, hey, hey! Hey, come on!

01:19:56.296 --> 01:19:59.299
Melee at the Hula-la.
Send M.P.s!

01:19:59.383 --> 01:20:00.759
- Aah!
- Aah!

01:20:02.261 --> 01:20:04.972
- You called me a lousy friend?
- Get your hands off!

01:20:05.013 --> 01:20:06.140
Aah!

01:20:07.724 --> 01:20:08.851
Ow! Shit!

01:20:10.811 --> 01:20:12.229
Come on, Danny!

01:20:17.776 --> 01:20:19.111
Let's go get 'em.

01:20:20.320 --> 01:20:21.655
Let's move out!

01:20:23.699 --> 01:20:26.034
Oh, no. They're gonna
throw us in the brig.

01:20:26.118 --> 01:20:27.494
Let's get outta here.

01:21:13.415 --> 01:21:15.209
Oh, shit.

01:21:17.461 --> 01:21:19.213
Rafe...

01:21:19.296 --> 01:21:21.215
you're the only family I got.

01:21:21.298 --> 01:21:23.634
When you were gone...

01:21:23.717 --> 01:21:25.886
it was the loneliest
I'd ever been.

01:21:25.969 --> 01:21:28.013
The same for her, too.

01:21:28.096 --> 01:21:30.557
Oh, boy, now you're really
breakin' my heart.

01:21:30.641 --> 01:21:32.810
If you hadn't gone,
none of this woulda happened.

01:21:32.893 --> 01:21:34.645
Oh, so it's my fault, I guess.

01:21:35.979 --> 01:21:37.272
Damn it, Rafe.

01:21:41.652 --> 01:21:45.072
I just know
there's got to be some way...

01:21:45.155 --> 01:21:48.534
we can work things out
so that...

01:21:48.617 --> 01:21:50.452
things could be right
between me and you.

01:21:51.537 --> 01:21:54.122
I just don't see how
it could ever be the same.

01:22:02.714 --> 01:22:04.007
Revered father...

01:22:08.178 --> 01:22:11.390
I go now to fulfill my mission
and my destiny.

01:22:13.016 --> 01:22:14.560
I hope it is a destiny...

01:22:14.643 --> 01:22:16.895
that will bring honor
to our family...

01:22:16.979 --> 01:22:19.439
and if it requires my life...

01:22:19.481 --> 01:22:21.233
I will sacrifice it gladly...

01:22:21.275 --> 01:22:23.610
to be a good servant
of our nation.

01:23:44.817 --> 01:23:46.819
Hey...

01:23:46.902 --> 01:23:48.362
we got a large haze.

01:23:51.323 --> 01:23:53.242
That's too big
to be planes, right?

01:23:57.704 --> 01:23:59.998
Is that what you wanna do?
Knight to knight five?

01:24:00.082 --> 01:24:01.667
Boom! Wrong move.

01:24:01.708 --> 01:24:03.585
Lieutenant,
radar's picking up...

01:24:03.669 --> 01:24:05.629
a large return
moving in from the northeast.

01:24:05.712 --> 01:24:07.548
Hang on.

01:24:07.589 --> 01:24:09.133
Relax.

01:24:09.216 --> 01:24:11.593
It's a flight of B-17s
coming in from the mainland.

01:24:13.512 --> 01:24:15.264
Nothing to worry about.

01:24:15.347 --> 01:24:16.890
A heck of a lot of B-17s.

01:24:19.226 --> 01:24:20.894
Good shot, Hop.

01:24:23.939 --> 01:24:26.024
This better be good, Commander.

01:24:27.568 --> 01:24:29.695
One of our destroyers reports
having fired and sunk...

01:24:29.820 --> 01:24:33.824
enemy submarine attempting
to enter Pearl Harbor at 0653.

01:24:33.907 --> 01:24:34.992
It's 7:20!

01:24:35.075 --> 01:24:36.451
We had decoder delays, Admiral.

01:24:36.577 --> 01:24:38.203
Relay this to Washington.
Recall the staff.

01:24:42.332 --> 01:24:44.042
"Failure...

01:24:44.126 --> 01:24:45.669
"'Peace talks...

01:24:45.752 --> 01:24:47.212
"useless. "

01:24:49.423 --> 01:24:51.758
Thurman here.
Tokyo transmitting...

01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:53.343
to their embassy
in Washington-

01:24:53.427 --> 01:24:55.387
"Discontinue use
of your decoding machine...

01:24:55.471 --> 01:24:56.930
"and dispose of immediately.

01:24:57.014 --> 01:24:59.057
"Special emphasis
on destroying important parts. "

01:24:59.141 --> 01:25:00.559
Do you read that?
Acknowledge.

01:25:07.858 --> 01:25:09.109
Admiral...

01:25:09.193 --> 01:25:10.611
Naval Intel intercepted
a transmission from Tokyo...

01:25:10.694 --> 01:25:12.488
to the Japanese embassy
in Washington...

01:25:12.571 --> 01:25:15.199
instructing them to break apart
all decoder machines...

01:25:15.282 --> 01:25:17.284
and burn all secret documents.

01:25:17.367 --> 01:25:20.287
The Japanese
are expecting a war.

01:25:20.329 --> 01:25:22.331
Should we?

01:26:09.002 --> 01:26:10.295
Warning of possible...

01:26:10.337 --> 01:26:13.048
Japanese aggressive movement
in any direction.

01:26:13.132 --> 01:26:15.676
"Broken relationship.
Hostilities imminent. "

01:26:15.759 --> 01:26:17.511
But where?

01:26:56.383 --> 01:26:58.427
Did you ever lose a fight,
Miller?

01:27:00.262 --> 01:27:02.556
I been lucky so far, Captain.

01:27:02.639 --> 01:27:04.224
From what I hear, it ain't luck.

01:27:05.934 --> 01:27:07.895
Ship's proud of you, son.

01:27:19.198 --> 01:27:21.992
Ha ha ha. Yeah! Ha ha!

01:27:42.095 --> 01:27:44.097
Why the hell's the Navy...

01:27:44.139 --> 01:27:46.725
doing practice this early
on a Sunday?

01:28:40.904 --> 01:28:42.030
- Aah!
- Get down!

01:28:49.371 --> 01:28:51.206
Go, go, go, go!

01:28:52.958 --> 01:28:55.085
I'm with Navy newsreel,
and I can tell you one thing-

01:28:55.169 --> 01:28:56.753
them ain't Navy planes!

01:29:01.091 --> 01:29:02.634
All hands,
man your battle stations!

01:29:02.718 --> 01:29:04.178
We're being bombed!
We're being bombed!

01:29:04.261 --> 01:29:05.387
Get up! Get up!

01:29:17.524 --> 01:29:19.735
Jesus Christ!

01:29:29.161 --> 01:29:30.204
Man your battle stations.

01:29:30.329 --> 01:29:32.164
Another dumb drill.

01:29:48.889 --> 01:29:50.432
All hands,
man your battle stations.

01:29:50.516 --> 01:29:52.726
- What the heck was that?
- It's a bomb!

01:29:55.187 --> 01:29:57.397
Move, move, move!

01:30:01.235 --> 01:30:02.528
Son of a bi-

01:30:08.450 --> 01:30:10.661
From outside!

01:30:10.744 --> 01:30:12.913
Get me the engine room!

01:30:15.082 --> 01:30:16.750
My God.

01:30:16.834 --> 01:30:18.961
Take cover!

01:30:19.044 --> 01:30:21.547
Down! Down!

01:30:21.630 --> 01:30:24.716
Report battle stations!
Manned and ready!

01:30:24.800 --> 01:30:26.301
Man your battle stations!

01:30:26.385 --> 01:30:28.053
This is no shit!

01:30:28.095 --> 01:30:29.596
They just sunk the Arizona!

01:30:29.721 --> 01:30:31.056
General quarters!
General quarters!

01:30:31.140 --> 01:30:33.100
All hands,
man your battle stations!

01:30:33.142 --> 01:30:34.601
This is no damn drill!

01:30:36.103 --> 01:30:38.730
Go! Go!

01:30:40.399 --> 01:30:42.609
They look like Japs.

01:30:42.693 --> 01:30:45.320
I didn't even know
the Japs were sore at us!

01:30:45.404 --> 01:30:47.364
Danny, you just get me
to a goddamn airplane!

01:30:50.742 --> 01:30:51.869
Holy God!

01:30:51.952 --> 01:30:54.329
This is good
footage. Did you see that?

01:30:54.413 --> 01:30:55.706
Holy cow!

01:30:55.789 --> 01:30:57.666
I hope
there's still an airfield left.

01:31:37.164 --> 01:31:39.625
Hurry up!
What in the world?

01:31:41.919 --> 01:31:43.420
Look! So many!

01:31:53.032 --> 01:31:55.868
Everybody to the hospital!

01:32:08.464 --> 01:32:10.341
Why's the Navy
always buzzin' us?

01:32:11.759 --> 01:32:13.636
shut up, Red!

01:32:15.346 --> 01:32:18.224
- Oh, man, come on.
- Red, it's too early.

01:32:18.265 --> 01:32:20.184
The Japs are here!

01:32:22.061 --> 01:32:24.188
What the hell?
Let's go! Let's go!

01:32:59.682 --> 01:33:02.226
- Get corpsmen to the bridge.
- Aye, Captain!

01:33:09.900 --> 01:33:12.820
Repair says third deck
is flooding port side!

01:33:16.115 --> 01:33:18.534
Yaah! Uhh!

01:33:31.714 --> 01:33:33.132
Get up!

01:33:33.215 --> 01:33:35.301
Get up, you cowards!
Get up there and fight!

01:33:35.426 --> 01:33:36.552
Move it!

01:33:40.556 --> 01:33:42.141
Take cover!

01:33:49.857 --> 01:33:51.150
I got you, Captain.

01:33:51.233 --> 01:33:52.610
You radio for air cover!

01:33:52.735 --> 01:33:55.196
Initiate damage control!

01:33:55.237 --> 01:33:58.240
Find my X.O.
Tell him to assume command.

01:33:58.275 --> 01:33:59.492
And you make sure the gunners-

01:33:59.533 --> 01:34:02.036
Everyone's where
they need to be, Captain.

01:34:02.071 --> 01:34:06.457
You trained us well.

01:34:07.875 --> 01:34:09.168
Captain...

01:34:12.630 --> 01:34:14.173
Aah!

01:34:42.076 --> 01:34:44.078
Go, go, go, go!

01:34:44.203 --> 01:34:47.248
Let's go! Let's go!
Everybody move!

01:34:49.208 --> 01:34:52.086
Get the ammo
for that fifty cal!

01:34:52.211 --> 01:34:54.380
Get that fifty cal!

01:35:00.219 --> 01:35:01.220
Let's go! We gotta get-

01:35:05.516 --> 01:35:07.893
Come on, man, we gotta
get this thing loaded up!

01:35:18.904 --> 01:35:20.906
- Aah!
- Aah!

01:35:23.701 --> 01:35:25.536
Let's go! Let's go!

01:35:28.122 --> 01:35:29.999
Come on!
Let's go! Let's go!

01:36:03.199 --> 01:36:05.618
Danny,
get me into a damn plane!

01:36:05.785 --> 01:36:07.787
Come on!

01:36:17.797 --> 01:36:20.925
Get some ammo up here!
We need some men on these guns!

01:36:21.092 --> 01:36:23.928
Sir! The captain says
you're in charge, sir!

01:36:23.969 --> 01:36:26.388
We need more ammo! Now!

01:36:26.514 --> 01:36:29.391
Send up ammunition
for the five-inch guns!

01:36:31.811 --> 01:36:33.229
Medic!

01:36:33.270 --> 01:36:34.396
All of 'em, now!

01:36:34.522 --> 01:36:35.564
Aah!

01:36:36.649 --> 01:36:38.359
Aah!

01:36:55.126 --> 01:36:58.587
Aah! Aah! Aah!

01:37:01.549 --> 01:37:03.134
Come on!

01:37:03.217 --> 01:37:06.011
Aah! Come on!

01:37:06.137 --> 01:37:08.514
Come on, you sum 'bitch!

01:37:09.682 --> 01:37:12.560
Aah!

01:37:15.271 --> 01:37:16.710
Aah ha!

01:37:16.745 --> 01:37:18.114
Oh, yeah!

01:37:18.149 --> 01:37:21.152
I need a doctor!
Somebody help me!

01:37:24.530 --> 01:37:27.408
Get to the supply room!

01:37:27.443 --> 01:37:30.286
Get everything out!

01:37:35.875 --> 01:37:38.169
- Aah!
- Planes incoming!

01:37:41.756 --> 01:37:43.591
Cut 'em down!

01:37:43.758 --> 01:37:46.635
Come on, come on!
Get 'em away from the windows!

01:37:53.058 --> 01:37:55.478
The mattresses!
Get 'em against the wall!

01:37:59.190 --> 01:38:01.233
Take cover!

01:38:08.657 --> 01:38:10.868
Is everybody all right?

01:38:10.910 --> 01:38:13.204
Can you stand? Can you stand?

01:38:14.955 --> 01:38:16.207
Hold your fire!

01:38:16.332 --> 01:38:17.917
Get to the gun! Hurry up!

01:38:19.919 --> 01:38:21.378
Get down, Danny!

01:38:24.924 --> 01:38:26.509
Aah!

01:38:30.513 --> 01:38:32.681
- Earl!
- This is Walker!

01:38:32.807 --> 01:38:35.184
We need to get those planes
fueled and loaded right now!

01:38:35.226 --> 01:38:37.228
What's going on
out there? Huh?

01:38:37.394 --> 01:38:38.813
Danny,
what the hell's that noise?

01:38:38.896 --> 01:38:40.523
You guys doin' target practice
or something?

01:38:40.558 --> 01:38:42.233
I think World War II
just started.

01:38:50.699 --> 01:38:53.119
Go, go, go!

01:39:00.584 --> 01:39:02.294
- Billy!
- Run!

01:39:02.420 --> 01:39:05.548
- It's gonna blow!
- It's a dud.

01:39:05.714 --> 01:39:07.591
It's a dud!

01:39:17.268 --> 01:39:18.436
Come on, get down!

01:39:18.561 --> 01:39:20.980
Danny!
Danny, are you all right?

01:39:21.021 --> 01:39:22.148
I'm all right!

01:39:22.231 --> 01:39:23.858
Come on, let's go!
Come on, let's go!

01:39:23.983 --> 01:39:26.152
Gooz, come on, man!

01:39:49.884 --> 01:39:53.220
We're sinking! We're sinking!

01:40:01.020 --> 01:40:04.315
Stay together!
Close the hatches!

01:40:18.496 --> 01:40:20.498
- I can't swim!
- Just hang on!

01:40:33.511 --> 01:40:35.971
Let's move it now!

01:40:36.097 --> 01:40:37.681
Joe! Go! Go!

01:40:37.807 --> 01:40:39.809
We're gettin' outta here!
Get in the car!

01:40:39.934 --> 01:40:41.227
Get in! Get in!

01:40:41.268 --> 01:40:42.645
Come on, let's go! Go!

01:40:42.686 --> 01:40:44.688
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

01:40:44.814 --> 01:40:47.358
Come on!

01:40:47.399 --> 01:40:48.692
Where's this place we're goin'?

01:40:48.818 --> 01:40:51.237
We got a small mechanic runway
about ten minutes away.

01:40:51.278 --> 01:40:52.988
Hasn't been hit yet.

01:40:58.536 --> 01:41:00.287
We got Zeros on our six!

01:41:05.543 --> 01:41:06.836
Duck!

01:41:33.446 --> 01:41:35.281
Help us!

01:41:38.576 --> 01:41:39.744
Aah!

01:42:01.766 --> 01:42:03.058
We're trapped.

01:42:05.060 --> 01:42:07.188
Try it! Try the door!

01:42:19.950 --> 01:42:21.619
Aah!

01:42:34.340 --> 01:42:36.634
Oh, my God! I'm going under!

01:42:41.972 --> 01:42:43.349
It's sucking me back!

01:42:44.350 --> 01:42:46.811
The current's too strong!

01:43:00.699 --> 01:43:01.826
They're shootin' at us!

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.128
I don't wanna die!
I don't wanna die!

01:43:42.324 --> 01:43:44.160
This is it.

01:43:44.201 --> 01:43:45.745
Get us out of here now!

01:44:09.643 --> 01:44:11.479
How bad?

01:44:11.604 --> 01:44:13.856
It's still not over, sir.

01:44:17.777 --> 01:44:21.864
An entire fleet at anchor.

01:44:21.906 --> 01:44:24.909
My God, my God...

01:44:47.807 --> 01:44:50.643
Barbara, fill every syringe
you can find with morphine!

01:44:53.813 --> 01:44:56.190
Fill up the kitchen!
Are you listening to me?

01:44:56.232 --> 01:44:57.650
Fill up the kitchen!

01:45:05.533 --> 01:45:08.411
Over there! Over there!

01:45:14.959 --> 01:45:16.836
We got a bad neckwound here!

01:45:16.961 --> 01:45:18.879
Surgery! Move!

01:45:18.963 --> 01:45:21.549
Get him to surgery!
Oh, God.

01:45:21.674 --> 01:45:23.259
In here!

01:45:23.426 --> 01:45:26.220
He's still bleeding!
Another hemostat!

01:45:26.262 --> 01:45:28.681
Hurry!
Give me a hemostat now!

01:45:31.517 --> 01:45:33.310
Damn it, hurry!

01:45:35.438 --> 01:45:39.275
Gimme another hemostat!
Another suture! Hurry!

01:45:39.316 --> 01:45:42.445
Give me a-
Oh, God, I'm so sorry!

01:45:47.450 --> 01:45:48.993
Doctor!

01:45:49.034 --> 01:45:51.454
Here! Aah!

01:45:58.335 --> 01:46:00.921
Am I gonna die?

01:46:01.046 --> 01:46:02.590
Nurse!

01:46:07.928 --> 01:46:09.472
Don't leave me!

01:46:09.555 --> 01:46:12.183
Doctor! Get over here!

01:46:14.351 --> 01:46:15.603
My fingers
are plugging his artery!

01:46:16.896 --> 01:46:18.481
Doctor, what do you need?

01:46:20.066 --> 01:46:22.359
Focus, look at me.
What do you need?

01:46:22.485 --> 01:46:24.904
- Hemostat.
- Hemostat.

01:46:27.323 --> 01:46:30.785
Here. All right, look at me.
You're going to be all right.

01:46:30.820 --> 01:46:32.661
You're going to be all right.

01:46:41.504 --> 01:46:42.887
I need more ammo!

01:46:42.922 --> 01:46:45.216
I need more ammo, ladies!

01:46:45.251 --> 01:46:47.510
I need more ammo!

01:46:47.551 --> 01:46:50.179
Earl! We good to go?

01:46:50.221 --> 01:46:51.889
- Mostly, but-
- Get down!

01:46:51.972 --> 01:46:53.974
- Shit! Get cover!
- Jesus!

01:46:57.103 --> 01:46:59.522
- Come on, you guys!
- Earl, get in here!

01:47:02.525 --> 01:47:05.236
Sergeant!
We need more than a shotgun!

01:47:05.271 --> 01:47:07.947
You got any other weapons
for coverfire?

01:47:07.982 --> 01:47:09.573
Inside that ammo locker!

01:47:09.698 --> 01:47:11.951
- Come on!
- Move it!

01:47:13.828 --> 01:47:16.288
- Go! Go!
- Get the guns out!

01:47:16.414 --> 01:47:18.249
You said the planes
are mostly ready, but...

01:47:18.290 --> 01:47:19.708
but what?

01:47:19.834 --> 01:47:20.876
She's down, she's broke,
she's shit.

01:47:20.960 --> 01:47:22.294
I got four left.

01:47:22.420 --> 01:47:24.839
One's good, two need ammo,
one needs fuel.

01:47:24.880 --> 01:47:26.966
Fall out
and load up in the bunker!

01:47:27.133 --> 01:47:28.426
Let's go! Get down!

01:47:28.551 --> 01:47:31.429
- Move!
- Get ready to roll this thing!

01:47:31.464 --> 01:47:34.105
Get down! Now!

01:47:34.140 --> 01:47:38.227
Anthony, Red, you stay here
and man the fifty-caliber.

01:47:38.262 --> 01:47:42.314
Gooz, get to the next bunker
and lay down some coverfire.

01:47:42.440 --> 01:47:43.566
Planes.

01:47:45.860 --> 01:47:48.154
Should we fire?

01:47:48.195 --> 01:47:50.573
Stay down! God damn it!
Hold your fire!

01:47:50.614 --> 01:47:52.324
Stay still! Nobody fire!

01:47:52.359 --> 01:47:54.034
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

01:47:57.621 --> 01:47:59.290
They don't know we're here.

01:48:00.166 --> 01:48:01.876
- Stay down.
- Fire?

01:48:02.001 --> 01:48:04.587
No, God damn it,
stay down, stay still.

01:48:04.754 --> 01:48:05.755
Don't fire.

01:48:10.217 --> 01:48:11.469
Oh, God.

01:48:20.478 --> 01:48:22.167
I don't see any ordnance.

01:48:22.202 --> 01:48:23.856
I think they're going home.

01:48:23.898 --> 01:48:26.609
No. They'll be back. We still
got planes on the ground.

01:48:26.776 --> 01:48:28.778
Pilots, listen up.

01:48:28.861 --> 01:48:30.905
Get all the speed
you can on the runway...

01:48:31.072 --> 01:48:32.782
don't get on the stick
till the very end.

01:48:32.865 --> 01:48:35.493
In the air, stay low
between the buildings.

01:48:35.528 --> 01:48:37.168
You see any Zero
on your tail...

01:48:37.203 --> 01:48:40.956
wipe him off, don't freeze.
Just keep moving.

01:48:41.082 --> 01:48:45.544
Try to separate 'em,
take 'em out one by one.

01:48:45.628 --> 01:48:48.506
P-40s can't outrun Zeros,
so don't try.

01:48:48.547 --> 01:48:49.882
We have to outfly 'em.

01:48:49.924 --> 01:48:51.926
We got high-level bombers!

01:48:51.967 --> 01:48:53.094
They'll bust this hangar
wide open!

01:48:53.219 --> 01:48:55.096
Grab the fifties! Let's move!

01:48:57.098 --> 01:48:58.974
Move! Move!

01:48:59.100 --> 01:49:01.519
Go, go, go!

01:49:04.271 --> 01:49:05.981
Zeros!

01:49:06.107 --> 01:49:08.192
Take cover! Take cover!

01:49:17.868 --> 01:49:20.538
Take cover! Take cover!

01:49:23.707 --> 01:49:24.834
Aah!

01:49:32.133 --> 01:49:34.718
- Get down! Get down!
- Let's go! In the box!

01:49:44.311 --> 01:49:45.563
Aah!

01:49:52.153 --> 01:49:53.279
Danny!

01:49:56.574 --> 01:49:58.159
Come on!

01:49:58.284 --> 01:49:59.417
Come on, buddy!

01:49:59.452 --> 01:50:02.037
Leave him, he's dead!
He's dead!

01:50:10.004 --> 01:50:11.630
They're kicking our butt.

01:50:11.756 --> 01:50:14.341
Get to the airplanes!
Go, go, go!

01:50:16.177 --> 01:50:18.596
Run! Red, Anthony, let's go!

01:50:22.558 --> 01:50:25.770
Come on, help me!
Goddamn belts!

01:50:29.482 --> 01:50:30.900
Let's go! Come on!

01:50:38.866 --> 01:50:40.326
Knock 'em dead.

01:50:40.367 --> 01:50:42.078
Quick! Get in! Put this on!

01:50:43.662 --> 01:50:47.249
They're coming around.
Bring 'em out! Let's go!

01:50:54.256 --> 01:50:56.926
Red, get out of here,
God damn it! Go!

01:50:59.512 --> 01:51:01.368
Come on, let's go.

01:51:01.403 --> 01:51:03.224
Joe, get out the way!

01:51:03.349 --> 01:51:04.809
I'm rollin'!

01:51:07.228 --> 01:51:08.813
Clear! Go!

01:51:08.896 --> 01:51:10.940
Oh, God. Planes!

01:51:12.108 --> 01:51:13.234
Come on, help me!

01:51:15.986 --> 01:51:19.407
Hey, Joe! You got three Zeros
behind you!

01:51:29.291 --> 01:51:31.544
Turn! Turn!

01:51:32.837 --> 01:51:33.963
Oh, God!

01:51:36.549 --> 01:51:37.675
Aah!

01:51:45.850 --> 01:51:46.851
Oh, shit.

01:51:46.976 --> 01:51:49.145
What are you doing? Get going!

01:51:49.228 --> 01:51:52.022
Danny, start that thing up
and get in the air.

01:51:52.148 --> 01:51:53.691
I'm not much good without
a wing man. I need you!

01:51:53.858 --> 01:51:54.859
I got you!

01:51:56.694 --> 01:51:58.738
Let's do it!

01:52:16.756 --> 01:52:18.883
It's real tight, Rafe!
Real tight!

01:52:33.898 --> 01:52:36.046
Hey, Rafe, I'm not sure
we have enough runway!

01:52:36.081 --> 01:52:38.194
Get your airspeed up
before you leave the dirt!

01:52:38.319 --> 01:52:40.362
Don't freeze. Don't freeze.

01:52:44.658 --> 01:52:47.244
I don't think
I'm gonna make it over!

01:52:47.369 --> 01:52:48.621
Come on! Come on!

01:52:58.214 --> 01:52:59.799
We did it! I'm up!

01:53:01.801 --> 01:53:03.636
We got Zeros behind us!

01:53:05.513 --> 01:53:06.931
How many you see back there?

01:53:11.519 --> 01:53:12.812
We got five on our six!

01:53:18.943 --> 01:53:20.945
Take it down to the deck, now!

01:53:29.537 --> 01:53:30.996
We gotta split 'em up.

01:53:32.248 --> 01:53:33.290
You take left, I'll take right.

01:53:39.296 --> 01:53:42.133
Earl, get some guns
in that goddamn tower!

01:53:42.168 --> 01:53:45.553
OK! Let's go! Into the truck!

01:53:51.434 --> 01:53:52.977
Danny, I got three on my six.

01:54:09.577 --> 01:54:10.870
Whoo!

01:54:14.457 --> 01:54:17.168
Stop! Stop! Let's go!

01:54:17.293 --> 01:54:18.753
Let's go! Move it!
Move it, Red!

01:54:20.337 --> 01:54:21.881
- Let's go!
- Gimme the fifty!

01:54:23.758 --> 01:54:26.469
Let's go! All right!

01:54:30.181 --> 01:54:32.183
I still got
two behind me, Rafe.

01:54:41.776 --> 01:54:43.360
Yaah!

01:54:46.072 --> 01:54:48.074
Son of a bitch!

01:54:52.078 --> 01:54:53.204
Whoa!

01:54:56.791 --> 01:54:59.668
Earl, God damn it,
get some guns in that tower!

01:54:59.794 --> 01:55:02.338
On the tower.
Going ten stories up.

01:55:02.379 --> 01:55:03.798
It's a long son of a bitch.

01:55:12.389 --> 01:55:14.517
Rafe, they're all over me!
I can't get them off me!

01:55:22.817 --> 01:55:24.235
Danny,
I still got three on my tail!

01:55:28.197 --> 01:55:29.698
Keep jinking it!
Don't let them get a handle!

01:55:29.824 --> 01:55:31.242
I can't shake 'em!

01:55:32.827 --> 01:55:33.994
God damn it.

01:55:35.538 --> 01:55:37.998
Danny, let's play chicken
with these Jap suckers!

01:55:38.124 --> 01:55:39.542
I'm with you.

01:55:41.544 --> 01:55:43.129
Jesus!

01:55:47.258 --> 01:55:49.677
- I'm coming right at you!
- Don't brake till I tell you.

01:55:51.512 --> 01:55:52.555
Not yet! Not yet!

01:55:53.722 --> 01:55:54.849
Come on!

01:55:56.434 --> 01:55:57.560
Go left! Now!

01:56:02.148 --> 01:56:05.151
- Whoo! We got 'em!
- Ha ha ha!

01:56:05.234 --> 01:56:06.444
Set up over there!

01:56:09.280 --> 01:56:10.865
Come on, load it!

01:56:10.906 --> 01:56:12.032
We're on the tower.

01:56:14.285 --> 01:56:16.912
I got one on my tail.
I'll bring him right by you.

01:56:16.996 --> 01:56:20.875
He's comin' around!
Let's get this Jap sucker!

01:56:24.170 --> 01:56:26.213
Hold your fire. Here he comes.

01:56:27.757 --> 01:56:29.884
You better be cocked and locked
when I come by!

01:56:32.303 --> 01:56:33.596
Hold your fire!

01:56:35.347 --> 01:56:36.599
Fire!

01:56:44.190 --> 01:56:46.192
Whoo! Good shootin', boys!

01:56:46.227 --> 01:56:47.943
Nice shot, Earl!

01:56:48.027 --> 01:56:49.487
Let's head over
to battleship row!

01:56:49.522 --> 01:56:50.613
I'm with you!

01:56:59.371 --> 01:57:01.207
Let's go do some business.

01:57:03.209 --> 01:57:04.335
I'm going after 'em.

01:57:15.679 --> 01:57:17.515
Rafe! I got him!

01:57:18.974 --> 01:57:21.227
- P-40's!
- Yeah!

01:57:23.521 --> 01:57:24.814
They're pulling
into the clouds!

01:57:24.939 --> 01:57:26.690
We ain't gonna let these
sons of bitches get home!

01:57:34.115 --> 01:57:36.117
How do you like someone
shooting back at you?

01:57:46.710 --> 01:57:48.129
Oh, I'm on your ass now!

01:57:53.134 --> 01:57:54.844
Yeah! I got one!

01:57:56.554 --> 01:57:58.139
Come on!

01:58:10.025 --> 01:58:11.152
God, come on!

01:58:19.910 --> 01:58:21.287
Come on, stay in there!

01:58:29.170 --> 01:58:30.463
Whoa!

01:58:34.341 --> 01:58:36.302
I got you, you son of a bitch!

01:59:23.808 --> 01:59:25.893
Who taught you how to fly,
Lieutenant?

01:59:27.812 --> 01:59:29.188
He did.

01:59:35.820 --> 01:59:38.697
I have to amputate here!
I have to amputate!

01:59:38.732 --> 01:59:40.116
You're not gonna die!

01:59:40.199 --> 01:59:41.826
I got you.
Hold onto this...

01:59:41.951 --> 01:59:43.411
Sandra,
we're running out of morphine.

01:59:43.536 --> 01:59:45.955
Find some way to mark 'em...

01:59:45.996 --> 01:59:49.959
So we can keep track
of who's got morphine already.

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:51.877
Tell me about your ship.
What ship are you from?

01:59:51.961 --> 01:59:54.547
It's not marking.
Have you got a marker?

01:59:58.843 --> 02:00:01.783
Use my lipstick!
Put "M" for morphine.

02:00:01.818 --> 02:00:04.723
- We need a tourniquet!
- Tourniquet!

02:00:06.267 --> 02:00:08.018
Where are the clamps?

02:00:13.607 --> 02:00:15.234
There's nothing left!

02:00:17.236 --> 02:00:19.155
- Evelyn!
- Here, use this.

02:00:19.196 --> 02:00:21.323
Go outside.
There's too many to help.

02:00:21.449 --> 02:00:22.832
Sort them out.

02:00:22.867 --> 02:00:25.035
Only those that can be saved
you bring in.

02:00:25.161 --> 02:00:26.746
I can't...

02:00:26.871 --> 02:00:28.622
No, please,
I need you to do it!

02:00:28.748 --> 02:00:29.915
Go! Go!

02:00:45.347 --> 02:00:47.183
Aah!

02:00:57.485 --> 02:01:00.362
Don't look at anyone
without a mark!

02:01:00.488 --> 02:01:02.198
I told you, stand back!

02:01:02.239 --> 02:01:03.783
Keep 'em outside!

02:01:03.866 --> 02:01:06.243
Come on! Let's go!

02:01:08.245 --> 02:01:09.914
Wait here.

02:01:09.955 --> 02:01:12.917
Don't touch me, you Jap!
Get your hands off me!

02:01:12.958 --> 02:01:14.794
Get him into critical.

02:01:14.877 --> 02:01:18.214
- Get him off me.
- Critical, frontward!

02:01:20.091 --> 02:01:22.259
How bad am I?

02:01:22.384 --> 02:01:24.095
You're gonna be just fine,
sweetheart.

02:01:24.220 --> 02:01:26.514
- I don't wanna die.
- You're not gonna die.

02:01:26.549 --> 02:01:28.516
I've got your hand.

02:01:28.641 --> 02:01:30.518
Do you have enough morphine
to make him comfortable?

02:01:30.553 --> 02:01:31.644
He won't make it.

02:01:31.685 --> 02:01:32.895
Line the critical up!

02:01:32.937 --> 02:01:34.814
Get him morphine.
Take him over there!

02:01:34.849 --> 02:01:36.565
Burn victims by the tree!

02:01:36.690 --> 02:01:38.908
I just found her!

02:01:38.943 --> 02:01:40.799
I don't think she's breathing.

02:01:40.834 --> 02:01:42.655
No, she's dead. Take her-

02:01:45.950 --> 02:01:48.828
Oh, God.

02:01:48.869 --> 02:01:52.581
Are you sure, Ev?
Check her again.

02:01:52.706 --> 02:01:55.126
She's dead.
Take her over there!

02:01:55.209 --> 02:01:56.961
But you've gotta be sure!

02:01:57.002 --> 02:01:59.547
She's dead!
Go back to work, Sandra.

02:01:59.588 --> 02:02:03.259
I don't know what to do!

02:03:35.101 --> 02:03:36.644
Over here!

02:03:36.811 --> 02:03:37.812
Admiral?

02:03:37.937 --> 02:03:40.189
From Washington.

02:03:41.232 --> 02:03:43.818
"Attack by Japan
considered imminent. "

02:03:48.531 --> 02:03:50.699
They're only an hour late.

02:04:48.466 --> 02:04:49.724
How can we help?

02:04:49.759 --> 02:04:52.553
We need blood. Come on.

02:04:55.473 --> 02:04:57.767
Remember, son,
hold on to your faith.

02:04:57.802 --> 02:04:59.894
1,500 cartons over there.

02:05:00.019 --> 02:05:02.063
"'Today you will be
with me in paradise...

02:05:02.188 --> 02:05:03.606
"so fear not. "

02:05:03.647 --> 02:05:05.740
Fear not, my son.

02:05:05.775 --> 02:05:08.319
You are a man truly blessed.

02:05:08.360 --> 02:05:11.072
You will die
in a state of grace.

02:05:11.197 --> 02:05:15.076
Remember, pain is temporary,
but glory is forever.

02:05:15.201 --> 02:05:17.168
Hold on to your faith, my son.

02:05:17.203 --> 02:05:20.498
You'll be with God, the saints,
and the angels soon.

02:05:20.623 --> 02:05:22.173
I absolve you of your sins...

02:05:22.208 --> 02:05:26.212
in the name of the Father,
the Son, the Holy Spirit.

02:05:26.247 --> 02:05:28.798
Innomine patris et fili,
et spiritus sancti.

02:05:28.881 --> 02:05:30.508
Amen.

02:05:37.098 --> 02:05:39.100
Go with God, my son.

02:05:45.689 --> 02:05:47.942
We've got men trapped
everywhere in the harbor.

02:05:48.109 --> 02:05:49.819
We need help
from anybody who can move.

02:05:57.868 --> 02:05:59.537
There's somebody in here!

02:05:59.662 --> 02:06:01.414
Get somebody down here!

02:06:03.833 --> 02:06:05.251
They're cutting through!

02:06:10.840 --> 02:06:13.968
I hear somebody!
Get some guys up here!

02:06:14.003 --> 02:06:16.011
Pull!

02:06:18.723 --> 02:06:21.851
Get us out!
It's filling with water!

02:06:21.892 --> 02:06:23.561
Get an airline in here!

02:06:26.272 --> 02:06:29.150
We need the air hose!
What can we do?

02:06:33.571 --> 02:06:35.990
It won't cut any faster!

02:06:38.909 --> 02:06:42.288
- Cut him out!
- Aah!

02:07:14.487 --> 02:07:15.905
Yesterday...

02:07:15.946 --> 02:07:20.326
December 7, 1941...

02:07:21.535 --> 02:07:24.789
a date
which will live in infamy...

02:07:24.824 --> 02:07:27.792
the United States of America...

02:07:27.875 --> 02:07:30.920
was suddenly
and deliberately attacked...

02:07:31.087 --> 02:07:35.674
by naval and air forces
of the empire of Japan.

02:07:38.094 --> 02:07:39.261
It is obvious...

02:07:39.345 --> 02:07:43.933
that planning the attack
began many weeks ago.

02:07:43.974 --> 02:07:46.456
During the intervening time...

02:07:46.491 --> 02:07:48.938
the Japanese government...

02:07:48.979 --> 02:07:52.525
has deliberately sought to
deceive the United States...

02:07:52.560 --> 02:07:54.652
by false statements...

02:07:54.693 --> 02:07:59.407
and expressions of hope
for continued peace.

02:07:59.532 --> 02:08:04.412
The attack yesterday
on the Hawaiian Islands...

02:08:04.537 --> 02:08:09.667
has caused severe damage
to American military forces.

02:08:09.708 --> 02:08:11.252
I regret to tell you...

02:08:11.293 --> 02:08:16.674
that over 3,000 American lives
have been lost.

02:08:16.715 --> 02:08:19.718
No matter how long
it may take us...

02:08:19.844 --> 02:08:23.514
to overcome
this premeditated invasion...

02:08:23.556 --> 02:08:27.727
the American people,
in their righteous might...

02:08:27.852 --> 02:08:30.438
will win through
to absolute victory.

02:08:34.567 --> 02:08:40.573
Because of this unprovoked,
dastardly attack by Japan...

02:08:40.740 --> 02:08:44.535
I ask that the Congress
declare a state of war.

02:08:50.108 --> 02:08:51.567
Is it true...

02:08:51.651 --> 02:08:55.238
men are still trapped alive
inside the Arizona?

02:08:57.240 --> 02:08:59.242
We can hear tapping
from inside the hull.

02:08:59.367 --> 02:09:00.910
We're doing everything we can
to get to them...

02:09:00.952 --> 02:09:02.829
but they're
forty feet below water.

02:09:09.419 --> 02:09:12.651
We've been trained to think
that we're invincible.

02:09:12.686 --> 02:09:15.883
And now our proudest ships
have been destroyed...

02:09:15.967 --> 02:09:19.887
by an enemy
we considered inferior.

02:09:19.971 --> 02:09:22.223
We're on the ropes, gentlemen.

02:09:22.265 --> 02:09:26.227
That's exactly why
we have to strike back now.

02:09:26.269 --> 02:09:29.112
We'll attack the Marshall
and Gilbert Islands, sir.

02:09:29.147 --> 02:09:32.984
I mean hitting the heart of
Japan the way they have hit us.

02:09:34.861 --> 02:09:36.863
Mr. President...

02:09:36.904 --> 02:09:40.324
Pearl Harbor caught us unawares
because we didn't face facts.

02:09:40.450 --> 02:09:43.418
This isn't a time
for ignoring them again.

02:09:43.453 --> 02:09:46.873
We have long-range bombers,
but no place to launch them.

02:09:46.914 --> 02:09:50.752
Midway is too far,
and Russia won't allow us...

02:09:50.877 --> 02:09:52.170
to launch a raid from there.

02:09:53.463 --> 02:09:54.547
Admiral?

02:09:54.589 --> 02:09:56.007
Navy's planes are small.

02:09:56.048 --> 02:09:57.884
They carry light loads
and have a short range.

02:09:58.009 --> 02:10:01.304
We'd have to get them within
a few hundred miles of Japan.

02:10:01.339 --> 02:10:04.474
We'd risk our carriers,
and if we lose them...

02:10:04.509 --> 02:10:06.184
we'll have no shield
against invasion.

02:10:06.309 --> 02:10:09.228
Does anyone in this room
think victory is possible...

02:10:09.312 --> 02:10:10.897
without facing danger?

02:10:11.022 --> 02:10:13.941
We are at war.
Of course there's a risk.

02:10:14.066 --> 02:10:16.194
But consider the risk,
Mr. President.

02:10:16.319 --> 02:10:19.072
If the Japanese
invade us right now...

02:10:19.197 --> 02:10:22.200
they would reach Chicago
before we could stop them.

02:10:24.494 --> 02:10:26.370
Gentlemen...

02:10:28.081 --> 02:10:33.044
most of you did not know me
when I had the use of my legs.

02:10:33.086 --> 02:10:36.798
I was strong and proud...
and arrogant.

02:10:36.881 --> 02:10:40.635
Now I wonder,
every hour of my life...

02:10:40.676 --> 02:10:44.555
why God put me into this chair.

02:10:44.639 --> 02:10:48.101
But when I see defeat
in the eyes of my country men-

02:10:48.136 --> 02:10:50.485
in your eyes, right now-

02:10:50.520 --> 02:10:53.523
I start to think that
maybe he brought me down...

02:10:53.648 --> 02:10:54.941
for times like these...

02:10:54.982 --> 02:10:57.652
when we all need to be reminded
who we truly are-

02:10:57.819 --> 02:11:00.947
that we will not
give up or give in.

02:11:00.988 --> 02:11:02.407
Mr. President,
with all respect, sir...

02:11:02.532 --> 02:11:04.409
what you're asking
can't be done.

02:11:20.425 --> 02:11:22.844
- Mr. President!
- Get back, George!

02:11:22.879 --> 02:11:24.137
Get back.

02:11:36.441 --> 02:11:38.985
Do not tell me...

02:11:39.026 --> 02:11:41.154
it can't be done.

02:11:45.867 --> 02:11:48.870
Japan continues
its military conquest...

02:11:48.911 --> 02:11:50.037
throughout the Pacific.

02:11:51.748 --> 02:11:53.256
But, back home...

02:11:53.291 --> 02:11:55.710
millions of American workers
band together...

02:11:55.752 --> 02:11:58.629
bringing factories to life
to avenge Pearl Harbor.

02:12:03.176 --> 02:12:05.887
Mr. President, we have an idea
how to bomb the Japanese.

02:12:06.012 --> 02:12:08.765
Sir, it's risky...

02:12:08.800 --> 02:12:10.308
but it's bold.

02:12:11.934 --> 02:12:14.353
- Who are you?
- I, sir?

02:12:14.479 --> 02:12:16.063
Captain Low, Mr. President.

02:12:17.482 --> 02:12:19.650
He's a submariner.
He came up with this idea.

02:12:19.776 --> 02:12:22.195
I like sub commanders.

02:12:22.236 --> 02:12:26.365
They don't have time
for bullshit, and neither do I.

02:12:26.491 --> 02:12:27.950
Fire away, gentlemen.

02:12:44.634 --> 02:12:46.511
And where is God in all this?

02:12:48.346 --> 02:12:53.101
Our enemies believe
a divine wind protects them.

02:12:53.226 --> 02:12:56.938
But we see our friends
laid out here before us.

02:13:18.835 --> 02:13:19.961
Hey, Captain.

02:13:43.734 --> 02:13:45.319
Lieutenants Rafe McCawley,
Daniel Walker.

02:13:45.445 --> 02:13:46.863
Yes, Major?

02:13:47.029 --> 02:13:50.283
You're both going stateside.
Fly out in two hours.

02:13:50.450 --> 02:13:51.701
What for, sir?

02:13:51.743 --> 02:13:53.327
Ask Colonel Doolittle.

02:13:56.998 --> 02:13:58.332
Yes, sir.

02:14:14.056 --> 02:14:15.349
You're packing.

02:14:18.603 --> 02:14:19.861
Orders.

02:14:19.896 --> 02:14:22.607
What kind of orders?

02:14:22.648 --> 02:14:26.194
The top-secret kind.

02:14:26.319 --> 02:14:28.362
The dangerous kind.

02:14:30.364 --> 02:14:32.040
I can't find Danny.

02:14:32.075 --> 02:14:34.368
Is that why you're here?

02:14:34.494 --> 02:14:35.787
Looking for Danny?

02:14:37.205 --> 02:14:38.498
Probably saying good-bye
to his squadron.

02:14:38.581 --> 02:14:39.624
We've been assigned
to Doolittle.

02:14:49.550 --> 02:14:51.219
I wasn't looking for Danny.

02:14:56.516 --> 02:14:57.975
I couldn't have you go away...

02:14:58.101 --> 02:14:59.936
without you
understanding something.

02:15:05.525 --> 02:15:07.652
Yeah. You don't have
to explain anything.

02:15:07.819 --> 02:15:12.115
I do, because you're acting
like I didn't love you.

02:15:12.198 --> 02:15:15.284
Evelyn,
loving you kept me alive.

02:15:26.254 --> 02:15:27.804
I should've died over there.

02:15:27.839 --> 02:15:32.427
When I was in that water,
I made a deal with God.

02:15:34.137 --> 02:15:35.812
I told him I was sorry...

02:15:35.847 --> 02:15:38.599
that I knew I'd been a fool
for leaving you...

02:15:38.683 --> 02:15:40.852
trying to go over there
and be a hero...

02:15:42.270 --> 02:15:44.272
and I promised I'd never ask
for anything again...

02:15:45.565 --> 02:15:48.443
if I could just see you
one more time.

02:15:51.988 --> 02:15:53.156
And you know what?

02:15:55.324 --> 02:15:56.617
It was worth it.

02:15:58.578 --> 02:16:02.039
You kept me alive, Evelyn.
You brought me home.

02:16:03.166 --> 02:16:05.460
So I'm gonna stand by
my end of the deal.

02:16:05.543 --> 02:16:07.295
I'm gonna walk away.

02:16:07.336 --> 02:16:10.590
And I won't ask you
for anything.

02:16:10.757 --> 02:16:12.467
But I just want to know why.

02:16:12.550 --> 02:16:15.470
Just tell me that, will you,
please? Just tell me why.

02:16:17.054 --> 02:16:19.182
Rafe, I'm pregnant.

02:16:28.232 --> 02:16:30.026
Oh, my God.

02:16:33.361 --> 02:16:36.656
I didn't even know until
the day you turned up alive.

02:16:38.242 --> 02:16:40.787
And then all this happened.

02:16:42.496 --> 02:16:43.790
I haven't told Danny.

02:16:45.374 --> 02:16:47.502
I don't want him to know.

02:16:47.627 --> 02:16:49.504
All he needs to think about...

02:16:49.545 --> 02:16:52.340
is how to do this mission
and get back alive.

02:16:55.218 --> 02:16:58.477
Rafe, all I ever wanted...

02:16:58.513 --> 02:17:01.682
was for us to have a home,
grow old together...

02:17:01.808 --> 02:17:04.776
but life never asked me
what I wanted.

02:17:04.811 --> 02:17:07.939
Now, I'm gonna give Danny
my whole heart...

02:17:09.941 --> 02:17:12.235
but I don't think I'll ever
look at another sunset...

02:17:12.276 --> 02:17:13.986
without thinking of you.

02:17:18.116 --> 02:17:19.909
I'll love you my whole life.

02:17:57.864 --> 02:17:59.741
I'll see you on board.

02:18:17.216 --> 02:18:21.304
You know, the only thing
that scares me...

02:18:21.344 --> 02:18:24.056
is that you might love him
more than you love me.

02:18:26.768 --> 02:18:28.311
I love you, Danny.

02:18:31.481 --> 02:18:34.191
And I'll be here waiting
for you when you come back.

02:18:52.376 --> 02:18:53.503
Follow me.

02:18:57.255 --> 02:18:58.674
Colonel.

02:19:02.929 --> 02:19:04.680
Congratulations
on your promotion, sir.

02:19:04.806 --> 02:19:06.516
I heard what you did.

02:19:06.550 --> 02:19:08.226
We can explain that, sir.

02:19:08.261 --> 02:19:09.977
Explain what?

02:19:10.102 --> 02:19:12.814
Whatever it is
you heard about us, sir.

02:19:12.939 --> 02:19:14.523
You mean the hula shirts
you were flying in?

02:19:19.904 --> 02:19:22.198
Or the seven planes
you shot down?

02:19:25.368 --> 02:19:28.830
You're both being awarded
the Silver Star...

02:19:28.955 --> 02:19:30.832
and promoted to captain.

02:19:32.290 --> 02:19:34.709
Is that the good news,
sir, or...

02:19:34.835 --> 02:19:36.421
You're just about
the only pilots in the Army...

02:19:36.546 --> 02:19:38.840
with combat experience.

02:19:38.965 --> 02:19:40.549
I need you for a mission...

02:19:40.591 --> 02:19:42.718
I've been ordered
to put together.

02:19:44.262 --> 02:19:46.013
You know what top secret is?

02:19:46.138 --> 02:19:47.397
Yes, sir.

02:19:47.432 --> 02:19:50.143
It's the kind of mission
where you get medals.

02:19:50.178 --> 02:19:52.402
But they send 'em
to your relatives.

02:19:52.437 --> 02:19:54.564
Top secret means
you train for something...

02:19:54.689 --> 02:19:57.115
never done before
in aviation history...

02:19:57.150 --> 02:19:59.277
and you go without knowing
where you're going.

02:20:00.611 --> 02:20:04.323
You do it on that basis
or not at all.

02:20:04.449 --> 02:20:05.742
I'll go, sir.

02:20:06.701 --> 02:20:08.578
I'll go, too, sir.

02:20:10.747 --> 02:20:14.000
By the way, the Brits sent
over your personal effects.

02:20:14.041 --> 02:20:15.168
Thank you, sir.

02:20:15.293 --> 02:20:16.586
There's only one more thing.

02:20:16.711 --> 02:20:20.465
Leave your goddamn hula shirts
at home.

02:20:23.468 --> 02:20:24.594
Dear Rafe...

02:20:24.761 --> 02:20:27.054
It's so strange
to be this far from you...

02:20:27.180 --> 02:20:31.225
but you should know this-
every night...

02:20:40.610 --> 02:20:42.779
I've been looking
all over for you.

02:20:44.197 --> 02:20:45.907
Danny, this...

02:20:47.325 --> 02:20:49.494
this ain't no time
to leave things unsaid.

02:20:50.787 --> 02:20:52.754
Now, we gotta face facts here.

02:20:52.789 --> 02:20:56.042
The fact is, we just both love
the same woman.

02:21:03.633 --> 02:21:06.636
She's the first girl I ever
felt this way about, Rafe.

02:21:09.222 --> 02:21:12.558
I couldn't help what happened
any more than you could.

02:21:16.813 --> 02:21:19.107
This is different,
though, Danny.

02:21:19.232 --> 02:21:20.900
Evelyn already lost
the man she loved once.

02:21:20.942 --> 02:21:22.902
I just don't want it to see
that happen to her again.

02:21:22.944 --> 02:21:26.114
Guys like us got no choice.
This is war.

02:21:26.197 --> 02:21:27.698
She knows that.

02:21:27.824 --> 02:21:30.243
Danny, don't do this.

02:21:30.368 --> 02:21:31.702
Don't go on this mission.

02:21:32.995 --> 02:21:34.831
You got nothing to prove.

02:21:36.207 --> 02:21:38.543
You've been protecting me
since we were kids.

02:21:40.128 --> 02:21:41.838
Yeah, well...

02:21:41.879 --> 02:21:43.840
you do tend to need it
from time to time.

02:22:03.443 --> 02:22:05.445
The mission I'm asking you
to volunteer for...

02:22:05.570 --> 02:22:07.155
is exceptionally dangerous.

02:22:08.030 --> 02:22:10.575
Take a look at the man
beside you.

02:22:10.700 --> 02:22:13.161
It's a good bet
that in the next six weeks...

02:22:13.286 --> 02:22:16.456
you or he...

02:22:16.539 --> 02:22:17.707
will be dead.

02:22:20.918 --> 02:22:23.463
Everyone brave enough
to accept this...

02:22:24.881 --> 02:22:26.549
step forward.

02:22:34.599 --> 02:22:36.476
Your grandmother
could take a B-25 off...

02:22:36.559 --> 02:22:38.936
on a mile-long runway.

02:22:39.061 --> 02:22:43.900
Well, I'm gonna train you
to do it in 467 feet.

02:22:43.935 --> 02:22:47.487
Because at 468 feet...

02:22:47.570 --> 02:22:49.489
you're dead.

02:22:49.614 --> 02:22:50.747
And once you get it up...

02:22:50.782 --> 02:22:53.576
you'll learn to fly it
like a fighter...

02:22:53.618 --> 02:22:55.787
thirty feet off the ground.

02:22:55.870 --> 02:22:57.080
I want you to say hello...

02:22:57.205 --> 02:22:59.582
to Lieutenant Jack Richards,
Navy Aviation.

02:22:59.624 --> 02:23:01.793
He'll help us
lighten these fat ladies.

02:23:01.876 --> 02:23:03.961
Dump that ash can.

02:23:04.087 --> 02:23:06.380
See that bomb sight?
Get rid of it.

02:23:06.506 --> 02:23:08.056
Colonel, he's crazy!

02:23:08.091 --> 02:23:10.093
- The lady's fat!
- Listen to him.

02:23:10.128 --> 02:23:12.095
She's fat.
We want a skinny lady!

02:23:17.266 --> 02:23:18.935
Max power!

02:23:21.813 --> 02:23:23.106
Get up, get up!

02:23:23.940 --> 02:23:25.400
- Damn!
- How the heck-

02:23:25.525 --> 02:23:26.818
Damn!

02:23:34.700 --> 02:23:36.411
They just keep
rolling past that line.

02:23:36.536 --> 02:23:37.919
Maybe it's a bad idea.

02:23:37.954 --> 02:23:40.581
No, they're too heavy.
We gotta get drastic.

02:23:40.706 --> 02:23:42.250
This armored plating goes.

02:23:42.375 --> 02:23:45.128
I'm sure, I'm sure.
Lose it like a skirt, son.

02:23:45.253 --> 02:23:46.712
Release brakes!

02:23:48.840 --> 02:23:50.258
Come on, come on!

02:23:52.218 --> 02:23:56.139
- God!
- Put every man on the line!

02:23:58.724 --> 02:24:00.852
Let's show these boys
how this thing is done!

02:24:02.979 --> 02:24:04.856
Come on! Max power.

02:24:09.861 --> 02:24:12.029
Well, if he can do it...

02:24:29.172 --> 02:24:31.174
Well, gentlemen,
now I can tell you...

02:24:31.215 --> 02:24:33.050
that we're going to Tokyo.

02:24:34.886 --> 02:24:36.471
And we're gonna bomb it.

02:24:42.477 --> 02:24:44.187
That comes
as a special request...

02:24:44.312 --> 02:24:46.606
directly from
President Roosevelt.

02:24:46.647 --> 02:24:50.068
The Navy'll sneak us about
400 miles off the coast...

02:24:50.193 --> 02:24:51.486
and we'll launch
from the carrier there.

02:24:51.569 --> 02:24:53.071
Has that been done before?

02:24:54.197 --> 02:24:55.656
Taking Army bombers
off Navy carriers?

02:24:55.782 --> 02:24:58.910
- No.
- OK.

02:24:58.951 --> 02:25:00.661
Any other questions?

02:25:00.787 --> 02:25:02.789
Well, sir, is it even
possible to land...

02:25:02.872 --> 02:25:05.041
a B-25
on an aircraft carrier deck?

02:25:05.083 --> 02:25:06.918
That won't matter.

02:25:07.043 --> 02:25:10.254
As soon as we're airborne,
the carrier heads for Hawaii.

02:25:10.379 --> 02:25:12.507
But without them,
where do we land?

02:25:12.632 --> 02:25:15.384
I have a phrase
I want you to memorize.

02:25:16.928 --> 02:25:20.063
Wo shimeiguo ren.

02:25:20.098 --> 02:25:22.391
It means "I am an American".

02:25:23.935 --> 02:25:25.895
In Chinese.

02:25:26.979 --> 02:25:28.523
Ain't gonna be any easier.

02:25:28.648 --> 02:25:31.234
That's three feet shorter
than our practice runway.

02:25:31.359 --> 02:25:34.278
- Fellas?
- Sir.

02:25:34.404 --> 02:25:35.530
Sir.

02:25:37.532 --> 02:25:39.242
Secretary of the Navy
gave me these.

02:25:40.827 --> 02:25:42.085
What are they?

02:25:42.120 --> 02:25:43.955
Friendship medals
the Japanese gave us...

02:25:44.122 --> 02:25:45.665
when they were pretending
to want peace.

02:25:45.832 --> 02:25:47.125
What'll you do with them?

02:25:47.208 --> 02:25:49.710
Wire them to the bombs
and give them back.

02:25:52.964 --> 02:25:55.098
So what's going on?

02:25:55.133 --> 02:25:57.135
Well, sir,
we only have sixteen planes.

02:25:57.260 --> 02:25:58.428
So?

02:25:58.553 --> 02:26:01.848
When the Japs hit us,
they had more than 300.

02:26:01.889 --> 02:26:04.016
How much difference
can we make?

02:26:04.142 --> 02:26:05.893
It's not that we're afraid,
sir.

02:26:05.977 --> 02:26:09.439
But we might die, and
we want to know what it's for.

02:26:12.608 --> 02:26:15.445
You know, at Pearl,
they hit us with a sledgehammer.

02:26:17.321 --> 02:26:20.575
This raid,
even if we make it through...

02:26:20.616 --> 02:26:23.870
it'll only be a pin prick...

02:26:23.995 --> 02:26:25.747
but it'll be straight
through their hearts.

02:26:27.165 --> 02:26:30.626
Victory belongs to those
that believe in it the most...

02:26:30.752 --> 02:26:32.253
and believe in it the longest.

02:26:33.921 --> 02:26:36.466
We're gonna believe.

02:26:36.549 --> 02:26:38.760
We're gonna make
America believe, too.

02:26:38.795 --> 02:26:40.887
Colonel? I need a minute.

02:26:43.347 --> 02:26:46.184
- Excuse me, Major Jackson?
- Yes?

02:26:46.225 --> 02:26:47.351
Do you remember me?

02:26:48.770 --> 02:26:50.445
Oh, sure I do.

02:26:50.480 --> 02:26:52.899
I'm sorry.
I've been meaning to thank you.

02:26:52.940 --> 02:26:54.484
Well, maybe you can.

02:26:54.609 --> 02:26:57.862
When the news comes in
about the Doolittle boys...

02:26:57.904 --> 02:26:59.489
I want to be
in the command post.

02:27:00.573 --> 02:27:03.034
I'm sorry. I don't know
what you're talking about.

02:27:05.620 --> 02:27:07.622
How the hell
do you know about this mission?

02:27:08.873 --> 02:27:10.792
Let's call it
an inadvertent disclosure.

02:27:10.875 --> 02:27:13.211
Some flyboy you're dating
shot his mouth off.

02:27:14.545 --> 02:27:16.506
Actually,
it's about two pilots.

02:27:16.547 --> 02:27:19.766
I know they're going
into great danger.

02:27:19.801 --> 02:27:22.095
I just want to be there
when the news tells us...

02:27:22.220 --> 02:27:23.346
if they've lived or died.

02:27:27.642 --> 02:27:30.103
Most officers would have
thrown you in the brig.

02:27:30.138 --> 02:27:32.814
Most nurses
wouldn't keep their fingers...

02:27:32.897 --> 02:27:34.232
plugged in your artery.

02:27:39.987 --> 02:27:41.697
I can't promise you anything.

02:27:48.413 --> 02:27:51.124
Hey, Red,
you think they picked us...

02:27:51.249 --> 02:27:53.835
to do this
'cause we're young and dumb?

02:27:55.211 --> 02:27:57.713
Come on, Gooz,
we're the tip of the sword.

02:28:14.856 --> 02:28:16.441
In honor of our trip to Japan...

02:28:16.566 --> 02:28:19.569
I got us some victory cigars!

02:28:19.610 --> 02:28:22.412
- Yeah!
- There you go.

02:28:22.447 --> 02:28:24.741
Put that in your insidepocket,
next to your heart.

02:28:24.776 --> 02:28:26.576
You know, Jack,
we may lose this battle...

02:28:26.611 --> 02:28:29.245
but we're gonna win this war.

02:28:29.328 --> 02:28:31.748
- You know how I know?
- No.

02:28:33.750 --> 02:28:34.751
Them.

02:28:36.002 --> 02:28:37.462
'Cause they're rare.

02:28:38.755 --> 02:28:41.174
And at times like these,
you see them...

02:28:43.050 --> 02:28:44.302
stepping forward.

02:28:46.179 --> 02:28:49.348
There's nothing stronger than
the heart of a volunteer, Jack.

02:28:55.062 --> 02:28:56.189
My friends
in the war department...

02:28:56.314 --> 02:28:58.608
don't want me
to lead this raid...

02:28:58.775 --> 02:29:01.903
because they say
I'm too valuable.

02:29:02.070 --> 02:29:04.051
They don't want me
up in the air...

02:29:04.086 --> 02:29:06.032
flying with the men
that I've chosen...

02:29:06.199 --> 02:29:09.494
that I've chewed out, cussed
out, pushed to the limit...

02:29:12.205 --> 02:29:14.499
and that I've come to respect.

02:29:16.793 --> 02:29:18.628
They want me to stand
on the flight deck...

02:29:18.795 --> 02:29:21.214
and wave you off.
Well, I don't see it that way.

02:29:23.382 --> 02:29:24.509
So I'm going with you.

02:29:29.806 --> 02:29:31.349
We take off
tomorrow afternoon...

02:29:31.390 --> 02:29:33.643
drop our fire,
and head for China.

02:29:33.684 --> 02:29:36.229
Our mission
is to hit military targets...

02:29:36.264 --> 02:29:38.196
aircraft and tank factories.

02:29:38.231 --> 02:29:40.983
Colonel, you've given us
homing beacons...

02:29:41.109 --> 02:29:43.986
but you said China is
overrun with Japanese troops.

02:29:44.112 --> 02:29:46.114
What if the beacons
are switched off?

02:29:46.197 --> 02:29:47.782
Bring her down
any way you can...

02:29:47.817 --> 02:29:49.367
and do your best
to avoid capture.

02:29:49.409 --> 02:29:52.412
What if we have to bail out
over Japan?

02:29:52.537 --> 02:29:56.833
Well, in that situation,
I can't tell you what to do.

02:29:56.958 --> 02:29:58.835
What would you do, Colonel?

02:30:02.131 --> 02:30:03.966
I wasn't built
to be a prisoner...

02:30:06.009 --> 02:30:08.846
so I would have
my crew bail out.

02:30:08.971 --> 02:30:11.598
I'd find the sweetest
military target I could...

02:30:11.723 --> 02:30:13.851
and drive my plane right
smack into the middle of it...

02:30:18.941 --> 02:30:20.651
But that's just me.

02:30:23.528 --> 02:30:25.781
I'm forty-five years old.
I'm an old man.

02:30:25.822 --> 02:30:27.532
You guys have your whole lives
ahead of you...

02:30:29.117 --> 02:30:30.827
so what you do is up to you.

02:30:38.543 --> 02:30:41.672
The mission will launch
in a couple of hours.

02:30:41.713 --> 02:30:43.257
You'll stay right in here.

02:30:47.261 --> 02:30:48.553
Here. Stay here.

02:30:48.679 --> 02:30:50.806
Don't talk to them.
They won't talk to you.

02:30:50.847 --> 02:30:52.391
Pretend to type
the information we pass you.

02:30:52.426 --> 02:30:53.558
That's it.

02:30:55.519 --> 02:30:59.398
This is Orphan Annie
from Radio Tokyo.

02:30:59.439 --> 02:31:02.109
To all the lonely boys
in the South Pacific...

02:31:02.150 --> 02:31:04.403
watch out-
the enemy will get you.

02:31:04.528 --> 02:31:05.571
Maybe she's right.

02:31:10.284 --> 02:31:12.828
Japs transmitting!

02:31:14.162 --> 02:31:16.707
Captain, radar reports
Japanese patrol boats.

02:31:16.742 --> 02:31:18.417
- Range 400 yards.
- How many yards?

02:31:18.458 --> 02:31:20.002
400 yards and closing, sir.

02:31:20.085 --> 02:31:23.046
Richards, Japs!
400 yards! Let's go!

02:31:23.130 --> 02:31:25.882
Admiral Halsey's ordering
the cruisers to open fire!

02:31:26.008 --> 02:31:29.011
We gotta sink these Jap boats
before they give us away.

02:31:29.046 --> 02:31:30.304
Go to general quarters!

02:31:30.339 --> 02:31:32.740
Go, go, go, go!

02:31:32.775 --> 02:31:35.142
Oh, my God.

02:31:35.309 --> 02:31:37.894
This can't be good!

02:31:38.020 --> 02:31:40.314
All hands,
man your battle stations.

02:31:44.151 --> 02:31:47.321
Japs one mile away.
They reported our position.

02:31:47.404 --> 02:31:50.324
Supposed to launch
400 miles away. How far are we?

02:31:50.407 --> 02:31:51.909
624 miles.

02:31:52.034 --> 02:31:54.161
- Jesus!
- What do you want to do?

02:31:58.790 --> 02:32:01.335
Colonel, I don't know
if the planes...

02:32:01.460 --> 02:32:03.211
can carry enough fuel
to make it to China.

02:32:04.087 --> 02:32:06.340
Now. We launch now!

02:32:07.925 --> 02:32:10.052
Army pilots! Man your planes!

02:32:10.087 --> 02:32:12.054
Man your planes!

02:32:14.765 --> 02:32:16.913
They're shooting at something.

02:32:16.948 --> 02:32:19.061
- Let's go!
- It ain't a drill!

02:32:30.656 --> 02:32:32.950
Colonel!
We're too far out to make it!

02:32:33.075 --> 02:32:36.036
They need more fuel,
but they can't get too heavy!

02:32:36.078 --> 02:32:39.790
Strip everything out of
this plane you don't need now!

02:32:42.084 --> 02:32:43.669
Start pre-flight! Let's go!

02:32:43.752 --> 02:32:46.380
Add ten cans of fuel
for each plane!

02:32:46.505 --> 02:32:48.382
Every plane!

02:32:51.551 --> 02:32:53.387
Let's go! Move!

02:32:53.553 --> 02:32:54.805
Guys, get up there!

02:32:54.972 --> 02:32:56.848
Lose those suitcases now!

02:32:56.974 --> 02:32:58.558
- What's your favorite gun?
- What?

02:32:58.684 --> 02:33:01.979
You want off this deck,
give me a gun now!

02:33:02.062 --> 02:33:03.146
It's still too heavy!

02:33:04.523 --> 02:33:07.818
Go to the kitchen,
get some broomsticks.

02:33:07.985 --> 02:33:09.570
Cut 'em down, paint 'em black,
and bring them here.

02:33:09.695 --> 02:33:12.739
We'll put a broomstick
where this gun was.

02:33:12.864 --> 02:33:14.533
What are you doing
to my plane?

02:33:14.575 --> 02:33:17.411
Tell your crew to take a piss
before they take off.

02:33:20.706 --> 02:33:22.583
We got broomsticks
for tail guns.

02:33:22.708 --> 02:33:26.128
Yeah.
Maybe it'll scare 'em.

02:33:26.295 --> 02:33:28.171
You take care of yourself
up there.

02:33:28.297 --> 02:33:29.298
Yeah, I will.

02:33:29.423 --> 02:33:32.426
Danny, be careful, you hear me?

02:33:32.593 --> 02:33:34.685
I will.
I'll see you, Rafe.

02:33:34.720 --> 02:33:36.888
Rafe!
We're the tip of the sword!

02:33:43.020 --> 02:33:46.023
- Turning on one!
- Turning on two!

02:33:50.444 --> 02:33:51.904
All right.

02:33:52.029 --> 02:33:53.739
You ready for this?

02:33:56.408 --> 02:33:59.328
- Superchargers low and latched!
- Low and latched.

02:33:59.411 --> 02:34:01.038
We're full into the wind!

02:34:01.163 --> 02:34:03.206
More speed! More speed!

02:34:14.343 --> 02:34:15.761
Are you nervous?

02:34:15.796 --> 02:34:17.179
No-yes, sir. Yes.

02:34:17.220 --> 02:34:18.764
When did you find religion?

02:34:18.805 --> 02:34:21.058
When you assigned me
to this mission, sir.

02:34:21.093 --> 02:34:22.726
Do me a favor.

02:34:22.768 --> 02:34:25.187
- What's that, Colonel?
- Pray for both of us.

02:34:25.229 --> 02:34:26.355
Tell me when!

02:34:26.480 --> 02:34:27.814
Let's go!

02:34:36.657 --> 02:34:38.200
Max power!

02:34:41.370 --> 02:34:42.829
Oh, please.

02:34:44.039 --> 02:34:46.416
Come on! Come on!

02:34:55.801 --> 02:34:56.934
Yeah!

02:34:56.969 --> 02:34:58.262
Way to go!

02:35:00.055 --> 02:35:02.557
Jesus, that was short.

02:35:04.393 --> 02:35:06.562
Move 'em up!

02:35:06.687 --> 02:35:09.523
Full power, here we go!

02:35:10.983 --> 02:35:12.442
Pull back!

02:35:20.867 --> 02:35:22.411
Ha ha ha!

02:35:23.745 --> 02:35:25.831
Come on, here we go, here we go!

02:35:37.593 --> 02:35:38.885
We made it!

02:35:57.029 --> 02:35:59.031
From Berlin, Rome, and Tokyo...

02:35:59.066 --> 02:36:01.617
we have been described...

02:36:01.700 --> 02:36:04.620
as a nation of weaklings
and playboys...

02:36:04.745 --> 02:36:08.332
who hire British,
Russian, or Chinese soldiers...

02:36:08.457 --> 02:36:10.918
to do our fighting for us.

02:36:11.043 --> 02:36:13.754
Let them repeat that now.

02:36:13.921 --> 02:36:17.466
Let them tell that to
General MacArthur and his men.

02:36:17.633 --> 02:36:21.219
Let them tell that
to the soldiers who today...

02:36:21.345 --> 02:36:25.057
are fighting hard in
the far waters of the Pacific.

02:36:25.182 --> 02:36:29.353
Let them tell that to the boys
in the flying fortresses.

02:36:29.388 --> 02:36:32.231
Let them tell that
to the Marines.

02:36:33.774 --> 02:36:37.194
That's Japan, fellas.
Tighten up back there!

02:36:37.236 --> 02:36:39.655
Man your guns!

02:36:39.738 --> 02:36:41.073
We're in the enemy's backyard!

02:36:43.200 --> 02:36:45.535
Look alive back there.
I see coastline.

02:36:52.668 --> 02:36:54.253
Heads up, boys! Heads up!

02:36:59.132 --> 02:37:00.968
Man your guns back there.

02:37:01.093 --> 02:37:03.095
I'm cocked and locked!

02:37:03.136 --> 02:37:04.554
Get ready, suckers!

02:37:12.688 --> 02:37:14.273
Approaching
targets for bombing raid!

02:37:14.398 --> 02:37:17.150
Open bomb bay doors.

02:37:17.276 --> 02:37:19.403
Ripley,
you gota target in sight?

02:37:20.988 --> 02:37:22.739
37 degrees!
Target in sight!

02:37:31.999 --> 02:37:34.293
All right, boys,
let's knock their clocks off!

02:37:34.376 --> 02:37:36.295
- Drop your ordnance!
- Bombs away!

02:37:36.420 --> 02:37:38.297
One away!

02:37:38.380 --> 02:37:40.591
- Bombs away!
- Bombs away!

02:37:40.626 --> 02:37:42.301
Two away!

02:37:51.310 --> 02:37:52.895
Three away!
Four away!

02:37:57.190 --> 02:37:59.318
We caught 'em by surprise!

02:37:59.443 --> 02:38:02.321
- Dropping ordnance!
- Bombs away!

02:38:02.404 --> 02:38:04.615
...factory.

02:38:10.037 --> 02:38:11.788
- Whoo!
- We got it!

02:38:11.914 --> 02:38:13.916
We hit our targets!
Good job, raiders!

02:38:26.929 --> 02:38:30.641
God! Jesus-what? Shit!

02:38:32.059 --> 02:38:33.810
We got flak everywhere!

02:38:36.063 --> 02:38:37.397
Go down there and get Gooz!

02:38:37.481 --> 02:38:39.358
I want everyone to separate!

02:38:39.399 --> 02:38:41.360
- Clean that up!
- Yes, sir.

02:38:41.395 --> 02:38:42.653
Try and clean that up!

02:38:42.778 --> 02:38:43.946
They're shooting flak at us!

02:38:55.415 --> 02:38:57.834
We gotta get out of this shit,
Gooz!

02:39:00.796 --> 02:39:04.675
- We got a fire!
- Tail's hit!

02:39:04.800 --> 02:39:07.552
The electrics!
We got a fire back here!

02:39:07.587 --> 02:39:10.055
I gotta short this out!

02:39:10.097 --> 02:39:12.683
Get into the clouds,
Danny, right now!

02:39:26.989 --> 02:39:28.282
God damn!

02:39:29.575 --> 02:39:30.867
Red, go check that out!

02:39:36.456 --> 02:39:37.874
We're getting covered!

02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:39.710
Just hope they don't hit a prop!

02:39:42.379 --> 02:39:44.047
Unh!

02:39:44.082 --> 02:39:45.716
I'm hit!

02:39:45.841 --> 02:39:47.467
They're tearing
this plane apart!

02:39:49.303 --> 02:39:51.179
Red, take it up, 800 feet.

02:39:51.305 --> 02:39:52.723
Aah!

02:39:55.601 --> 02:39:59.021
I think Theo's dead!
Theo, wake up!

02:39:59.146 --> 02:40:01.148
Theo!

02:40:01.315 --> 02:40:02.608
Get into the clouds,
Danny, right now!

02:40:02.733 --> 02:40:03.859
Get up in that soup!

02:40:03.901 --> 02:40:06.320
We're gonna pull out of this,
Gooz!

02:40:19.333 --> 02:40:20.626
Thank you, George.

02:40:25.714 --> 02:40:27.090
What is it, General?

02:40:27.174 --> 02:40:30.177
Colonel Doolittle had to
advance his execution order...

02:40:30.218 --> 02:40:31.929
by twelve hours, Mr. President.

02:40:32.054 --> 02:40:33.764
There will be no homing beacons.

02:40:33.805 --> 02:40:36.475
The plane carrying them
crashed en route to China...

02:40:36.510 --> 02:40:37.935
and our bombers
may lack the fuel...

02:40:38.060 --> 02:40:39.770
to reach the mainland, sir.

02:40:39.811 --> 02:40:45.359
So our boys are flying blind
on empty tanks.

02:40:47.194 --> 02:40:49.112
God help them.

02:40:57.120 --> 02:40:59.414
We're still not
getting a signal.

02:40:59.539 --> 02:41:01.958
All ocean and no land.

02:41:01.993 --> 02:41:04.378
Homing in on nothing.

02:41:06.797 --> 02:41:08.840
How many cans of fuel
we got left?

02:41:08.966 --> 02:41:10.801
These are all empty!

02:41:11.969 --> 02:41:13.387
Is this all you got?

02:41:13.553 --> 02:41:15.097
That's all we got, Red.

02:41:15.264 --> 02:41:19.518
Rafe! You better pray for land!

02:41:23.272 --> 02:41:24.815
Break radio silence.

02:41:26.400 --> 02:41:28.986
I'm sorry, gentlemen.

02:41:29.111 --> 02:41:31.363
You're all brave souls.

02:41:31.405 --> 02:41:34.575
The bravest I've ever had
the privilege of flying with.

02:41:34.700 --> 02:41:37.452
But we're on our own.

02:41:42.124 --> 02:41:44.876
This really was
a suicide mission.

02:42:00.475 --> 02:42:01.894
Engine one's fluctuating.

02:42:02.019 --> 02:42:04.396
We'll lose it any minute.

02:42:05.731 --> 02:42:08.317
- Rafe, you gotta prime it.
- I am. How about now?

02:42:11.486 --> 02:42:13.405
I see the coast.

02:42:13.440 --> 02:42:15.324
I see the coast!

02:42:16.325 --> 02:42:17.910
Copy that, Rafe.

02:42:18.035 --> 02:42:19.620
We're gonna make it.

02:42:19.745 --> 02:42:21.038
Danny, follow me.

02:42:21.163 --> 02:42:22.915
We can make this.
I can see the coast now.

02:42:23.040 --> 02:42:24.458
We're only a few miles out.

02:42:24.499 --> 02:42:27.169
We gotta find
a soft landing spot.

02:42:27.210 --> 02:42:28.921
I'm pushing up on two.

02:42:29.046 --> 02:42:31.214
Hold on
for a hard landing!

02:42:31.340 --> 02:42:32.925
I see rice paddies.

02:42:33.050 --> 02:42:34.343
We'll bring it in right here.

02:42:36.762 --> 02:42:38.764
Oh, God, engine one's dead.

02:42:38.805 --> 02:42:41.099
We'll lose engine two
any second.

02:42:44.728 --> 02:42:47.064
We can make it in. Easy.

02:42:47.105 --> 02:42:50.108
Pull it back, glide in on fumes.

02:42:52.402 --> 02:42:53.619
Japs!

02:42:53.654 --> 02:42:55.781
We got Jap patrols
all over the place!

02:42:55.948 --> 02:42:58.533
Japs! Land somewhere else!

02:42:58.659 --> 02:43:01.036
Strap yourselves in!
We're coming in hard!

02:43:01.078 --> 02:43:02.663
We're a deadstick.

02:43:02.698 --> 02:43:04.248
Get outta the nose!

02:43:05.540 --> 02:43:07.834
Hold on, boys!
We're going down!

02:43:10.087 --> 02:43:11.380
Watch the trees!

02:43:35.279 --> 02:43:36.989
Everyone all right?

02:43:38.407 --> 02:43:41.285
I'm OK! I'm OK!

02:43:41.410 --> 02:43:43.870
Where's Ripley?

02:43:43.996 --> 02:43:45.414
He's dead.

02:43:46.582 --> 02:43:48.458
Watch for Japs!

02:43:57.426 --> 02:43:59.720
- Jap patrols!
- Take cover!

02:44:17.404 --> 02:44:18.697
Who's got magazines?

02:44:18.739 --> 02:44:19.907
Got em!

02:44:20.032 --> 02:44:22.492
Gotta get up into those hills,
find the Chinese!

02:44:27.164 --> 02:44:29.041
They got us pinned down!

02:44:39.927 --> 02:44:42.512
- Danny!
- Rafe! Rafe, no!

02:44:42.638 --> 02:44:44.056
Danny!

02:44:44.181 --> 02:44:45.349
Rafe, you don't have a chance!

02:44:49.228 --> 02:44:51.939
God damn. Danny!

02:44:51.974 --> 02:44:53.357
Come on!

02:44:57.819 --> 02:44:59.036
Gooz? You OK, man?

02:44:59.071 --> 02:45:02.783
Danny? Aw, shit, Anthony.

02:45:02.824 --> 02:45:05.661
Gooz! Can you hear me?

02:45:05.786 --> 02:45:07.746
- Yeah.
- Come on.

02:45:09.122 --> 02:45:11.667
Danny.
Easy, easy, easy.

02:45:11.792 --> 02:45:13.252
I've had better landings.

02:45:13.377 --> 02:45:14.670
You saved us back there.

02:45:14.753 --> 02:45:16.380
I got something in my neck.

02:45:16.421 --> 02:45:18.423
- Let me pull this out.
- Where's Gooz?

02:45:18.548 --> 02:45:20.968
He's fine.
He's right over there.

02:45:38.443 --> 02:45:39.570
Rafe!

02:46:39.922 --> 02:46:41.632
Grenade!

02:46:50.933 --> 02:46:52.476
Danny.

02:46:52.517 --> 02:46:54.353
Danny!

02:46:54.394 --> 02:46:56.647
Danny! Oh!

02:46:59.650 --> 02:47:01.735
- Hold on!
- Rafe!

02:47:01.777 --> 02:47:03.403
Hold on, now. I got you.

02:47:03.528 --> 02:47:06.073
You're all right.
You're all right.

02:47:06.114 --> 02:47:08.659
I'm not gonna make it.

02:47:12.663 --> 02:47:13.956
Oh, yes, you are.

02:47:14.039 --> 02:47:17.501
Yes, you are. Now look at me.

02:47:17.536 --> 02:47:20.963
Rafe, I'm so cold.
I'm so cold.

02:47:21.088 --> 02:47:23.382
You're all right. Hey.

02:47:27.261 --> 02:47:29.680
Hey, Rafe?

02:47:29.721 --> 02:47:31.390
Can you do me a favor?

02:47:31.431 --> 02:47:32.975
What?

02:47:33.100 --> 02:47:37.271
Can you have someone else
write my name on the tombstone?

02:47:37.306 --> 02:47:40.274
You're not gonna die.
Look at me, listen to me!

02:47:40.399 --> 02:47:42.276
You ain't gonna die,
you hear me?

02:47:42.401 --> 02:47:44.278
Danny.

02:47:44.403 --> 02:47:45.661
Danny, you can't die.

02:47:45.696 --> 02:47:47.635
You can't die. You know why?

02:47:47.670 --> 02:47:49.575
'Cause you're gonna be a father.

02:47:49.700 --> 02:47:51.959
You're gonna be a daddy.

02:47:51.994 --> 02:47:56.164
I wasn't supposed to tell you.

02:47:56.290 --> 02:47:58.417
You're gonna be a father.

02:48:00.294 --> 02:48:02.379
Please.

02:48:06.008 --> 02:48:08.010
No. You are.

02:48:17.895 --> 02:48:19.313
Danny.

02:48:21.607 --> 02:48:25.444
Danny?

02:48:25.485 --> 02:48:27.613
Please, please!

02:48:27.648 --> 02:48:29.072
Please.

02:48:32.200 --> 02:48:34.786
God.

02:48:34.912 --> 02:48:37.331
Please, Danny.

02:48:47.633 --> 02:48:50.469
Hold your fire!
They're Chinese.

02:50:11.717 --> 02:50:14.052
When the action is over
and we look back...

02:50:14.136 --> 02:50:18.015
we understand
both more and less.

02:50:18.056 --> 02:50:20.183
This much is certain.

02:50:20.309 --> 02:50:21.852
Before the Doolittle raid...

02:50:21.894 --> 02:50:24.313
America knew nothing
but defeat.

02:50:24.396 --> 02:50:27.608
After it, there was hope of victory.

02:50:27.733 --> 02:50:30.903
Japan realized for the first
time that they could lose...

02:50:30.938 --> 02:50:32.487
and began to pull back.

02:50:32.613 --> 02:50:34.406
America realized
that she would win...

02:50:34.448 --> 02:50:36.450
and surged forward.

02:50:36.617 --> 02:50:39.328
It was a war
that changed America...

02:50:39.329 --> 02:50:40.329
...and the world.

02:50:41.128 --> 02:50:43.213
Dorie Miller was
the first black American...

02:50:43.296 --> 02:50:45.549
to be awarded the Navy Cross.

02:50:45.716 --> 02:50:47.300
But he would not be the last.

02:50:47.426 --> 02:50:49.720
He joined
a brotherhood of heroes.

02:50:56.578 --> 02:50:59.039
That's for all the raiders.

02:51:08.841 --> 02:51:12.136
World War II for us
began at Pearl Harbor...

02:51:12.261 --> 02:51:15.681
and 1,177 men
still lie entombed...

02:51:15.848 --> 02:51:17.683
in the battleship Arizona.

02:51:18.684 --> 02:51:22.980
America suffered...
but America grew stronger.

02:51:23.021 --> 02:51:25.114
It was not inevitable.

02:51:25.149 --> 02:51:27.860
The times tried our souls...

02:51:27.943 --> 02:51:31.321
and through the trial,
we overcame.

02:51:52.384 --> 02:51:53.642
Hey, Danny...

02:51:53.677 --> 02:51:57.681
how'd you like to go flying?

02:51:57.806 --> 02:51:59.683
Come here.

02:53:05.574 --> 02:53:09.369
When I think back
on these times

02:53:09.404 --> 02:53:13.165
And the dreams we left behind

02:53:13.332 --> 02:53:16.168
I'll be glad
'cause I was blessed

02:53:16.203 --> 02:53:20.464
To get to have you in my life

02:53:20.589 --> 02:53:23.884
When I look back on these days

02:53:23.925 --> 02:53:28.347
I'll look and see your face

02:53:28.472 --> 02:53:32.934
You were right there for me

02:53:35.771 --> 02:53:38.648
In my dreams
I'll always see you

02:53:38.683 --> 02:53:43.153
Soar above the sky

02:53:43.236 --> 02:53:47.658
In my heart, there'll
always be a place for you

02:53:47.783 --> 02:53:50.661
For all my life

02:53:50.786 --> 02:53:56.917
I'll keep a part of you
with me

02:53:56.958 --> 02:53:59.920
And everywhere I am

02:53:59.961 --> 02:54:03.590
There you'll be

02:54:03.625 --> 02:54:07.219
And everywhere I am

02:54:07.386 --> 02:54:11.181
There you'll be

02:54:13.558 --> 02:54:17.104
Well, you showed me
how it feels

02:54:17.145 --> 02:54:20.691
Feel the sky with in my reach

02:54:20.816 --> 02:54:24.201
And I always will remember

02:54:24.236 --> 02:54:28.281
All the strength
you gave to me

02:54:28.407 --> 02:54:31.284
Your love made me
make it through

02:54:31.410 --> 02:54:36.060
Oh, I owe so much to you

02:54:36.095 --> 02:54:40.711
You were right there for me

02:54:43.588 --> 02:54:46.550
In my dreams
I'll always see you

02:54:46.717 --> 02:54:51.103
Soar above the sky

02:54:51.138 --> 02:54:53.890
In my heart,
there'll always be

02:54:53.974 --> 02:54:55.559
A place for you

02:54:55.726 --> 02:54:58.729
For all my life

02:54:58.812 --> 02:55:04.818
I'll keep a part of you
with me

02:55:04.860 --> 02:55:07.362
And everywhere I am

02:55:07.397 --> 02:55:09.865
There you'll be

02:55:10.032 --> 02:55:13.452
'Cause I always saw
in you my light

02:55:13.487 --> 02:55:17.164
My strength

02:55:17.205 --> 02:55:19.333
And I want to thank you now

02:55:19.458 --> 02:55:23.628
For all the ways

02:55:23.754 --> 02:55:27.632
You were right there for me

02:55:27.758 --> 02:55:31.178
You were right there for me

02:55:31.219 --> 02:55:35.932
For always

02:55:36.058 --> 02:55:38.894
In my dreams
I'll always see you

02:55:38.935 --> 02:55:43.357
Soar above the sky

02:55:43.482 --> 02:55:45.901
In my heart,
there'll always be

02:55:46.068 --> 02:55:47.653
A place for you

02:55:47.778 --> 02:55:50.947
For all my life

02:55:51.073 --> 02:55:56.828
I'll keep a part of you
with me

02:55:56.953 --> 02:56:00.748
And everywhere I am

02:56:00.783 --> 02:56:04.544
There you'll be

02:56:04.670 --> 02:56:07.381
And everywhere I am

02:56:07.506 --> 02:56:12.219
There you'll be

02:56:12.386 --> 02:56:24.690
There you'll be
