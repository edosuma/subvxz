02:03.794 --> 02:05.656

THING YOU CAN EXPECT

02:05.656 --> 02:08.598
FROM THIS NEW RELATIONSHIP
OR ANY OTHER

02:08.598 --> 02:10.731
IS THAT IT WILL END BADLY.

02:12.633 --> 02:15.606

08:59.940 --> 09:02.042
IT'S NOT KEN BURNS,
BUT IT TUGS THE HEARTSTRINGS.

09:02.042 --> 09:04.014
NICE.
CONNECT THOSE HEARTSTRINGS

09:04.014 --> 09:06.817
TO THE PURSE STRINGS.

09:06.817 --> 09:08.018
EMILY.

09:08.018 --> 09:10.821
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE
HELPING ASHLEY ON THIS.

09:10.821 --> 09:13.053
OH, NO. THIS IS ALL ASH.
I CAME TO SEE DANIEL.

09:13.053 --> 09:14.925
OF COURSE YOU DID.

09:14.925 --> 09:17.157
THOUGH I DID PURCHASE
A TICKET TO YOUR TEA,

09:17.157 --> 09:18.889
IN MEMORY OF MY MOTHER.

09:18.889 --> 09:20.160
WELL, THAT'S TOUCHING.

09:20.160 --> 09:22.793
AND WHEN I HEARD THAT
DR. BANKS WAS SPEAKING,

09:22.793 --> 09:25.165
I KNEW THAT I JUST--I HAD
TO HAVE A FRONT-ROW SEAT.

09:25.165 --> 09:26.797
(chuckles)

09:26.797 --> 09:28.068
AND HOW
DO YOU KNOW MICHELLE?

09:28.068 --> 09:30.070
I'VE BEEN SEEING HER
FOR A YEAR OR SO.

09:30.070 --> 09:32.172
SHE'S HELPING ME
WORK THROUGH A FEW THINGS.

09:32.172 --> 09:35.075
MM. WELL,
YOU'RE IN GOOD HANDS.

09:35.075 --> 09:37.077
SO I IMAGINE I'LL BE
SEEING YOU AT THE TEA, THEN?

09:37.077 --> 09:39.850
I WOULDN'T MISS IT.

09:47.017 --> 09:48.188
(shower running)

09:48.188 --> 09:49.820
HEY, HANDSOME.

09:49.820 --> 09:51.121
(shower continues running)

09:51.121 --> 09:53.093
OOPS.
THOUGHT YOU WERE DANIEL.

09:53.093 --> 09:55.125
AH.
I'M SORRY TO DISAPPOINT.

09:55.125 --> 09:57.828
I WAS JUST ON MY WAY
TO THE FISH MARKET.

09:57.828 --> 09:59.870
THOUGHT I'D SEE HOW DANIEL
FELT ABOUT ROCK SHRIMP.

09:59.870 --> 10:02.172
OOH. DANNY'S ALLERGIC
TO SHELLFISH.

10:02.172 --> 10:03.904
GOOD THING I WAS HERE.

10:03.904 --> 10:05.976
YOU COULDA KILLED THE GUY.

10:05.976 --> 10:07.878
YOU SURE KNOW
A LOT ABOUT HIM.

10:07.878 --> 10:10.941
YEAH, WELL, BEST FRIENDS
ARE LIKE THAT.

10:10.941 --> 10:13.083
RIGHT. HARVARD BOYS.

10:13.083 --> 10:14.184
HMM.

10:14.184 --> 10:16.947
SO WHERE ARE YOU FROM
EXACTLY?

10:16.947 --> 10:18.018
EXACTLY?

10:18.018 --> 10:19.219
NOWHERE ANYMORE.

10:19.219 --> 10:22.052
(clears throat) MY FAMILY
HAS ESTATES ALL OVER THE MAP.

10:22.052 --> 10:23.153
HMM.

10:23.153 --> 10:24.995
(shower continues running)

10:24.995 --> 10:27.097
OH... DANNY TELLS ME
YOU'RE AN ORPHAN.

10:27.097 --> 10:28.228
THAT SUCKS.

10:28.228 --> 10:30.030
MONEY CAN BUY
A LOT OF THINGS,

10:30.030 --> 10:31.932
BUT FAMILY ISN'T ONE OF THEM.

10:31.932 --> 10:33.964
WELL, FAMILY
CAN BE OVERRATED.

10:33.964 --> 10:36.036
(shower continues running)

10:36.036 --> 10:38.869
SO, UH, WHAT TIME
DO YOU WANT HIM?

10:38.869 --> 10:40.210
7:00, 8:00?

10:40.210 --> 10:43.874
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'LL JUST GIVE HIM A CALL.

10:43.874 --> 10:44.875
(shower continues running)

10:44.875 --> 10:46.877
SEE YA.

10:46.877 --> 10:50.020
(shower continues running)

10:50.020 --> 10:53.023
(shower turns off)

10:53.023 --> 10:54.154
DID I JUST HEAR EMILY?

10:54.154 --> 10:55.225
YEAH. SHE JUST TOOK OFF.

10:55.225 --> 10:56.987
SHE SAID
THAT SOMETHING'S COME UP

10:56.987 --> 10:59.089
AND SHE HAD TO CANCEL DINNER.

10:59.089 --> 11:01.131
SERIOUSLY?
DID SHE SAY WHY?

11:01.131 --> 11:03.063
NOPE.

11:04.234 --> 11:05.966
SORRY.

11:07.938 --> 11:11.902

11:31.121 --> 11:33.123
OKAY, SO EVEN AFTER
THE ESTATE TAX,

11:33.123 --> 11:34.925
MY DAD'S LIFE INSURANCE
LEAVES US

11:34.925 --> 11:36.226

11:42.102 --> 11:45.135
HI.
WHAT ARE YOU TWO DOING HERE?

11:45.135 --> 11:47.037
I'M GETTING A LITTLE
FINANCIAL ADVICE.

11:47.037 --> 11:48.979
I'M--I'M THINKING ABOUT
SELLING THE BAR.

11:48.979 --> 11:50.180
(indistinct conversations)

11:50.180 --> 11:51.281
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

11:51.281 --> 11:54.044
I THINK IT'S NONE OF
OUR BUSINESS, NOLAN.

11:54.044 --> 11:56.016
I THINK HE SHOULD DO
WHAT HE WANTS.

11:56.016 --> 11:57.147
WELL, WHAT HE WANTS

11:57.147 --> 11:59.249
IS TO USE
HIS FATHER'S INSURANCE MONEY

11:59.249 --> 12:01.051
BUY A BOAT, SAIL TO HAITI,

12:01.051 --> 12:02.322
AND NEVER COME BACK.

12:02.322 --> 12:04.124
WELL, LIKE I SAID,
IT'S HIS CHOICE.

12:04.124 --> 12:05.325
AND HE ALREADY HAS A BOAT.

12:05.325 --> 12:08.098
HE SOLD THE BOAT.

12:08.098 --> 12:09.960
HE BEING ME.

12:09.960 --> 12:11.161
MM-HMM.

12:11.161 --> 12:13.233
NOLAN OWNS THE "AMANDA" NOW.

ACTUALLY.

12:16.106 --> 12:17.307

12:51.071 --> 12:53.143
YEAH, WHEN I, UH,

12:53.143 --> 12:55.345

12:55.345 --> 12:57.147
UH, THIS? YEAH. UH...

12:57.147 --> 12:58.348
THIS WAS MY MOTHER'S,

12:58.348 --> 13:02.052

HOW MUCH IT'S WORTH.

13:02.052 --> 13:03.283
YOU'D SELL

13:03.283 --> 13:04.284
(chuckles)

13:04.284 --> 13:06.316
UH, OOPS. WELL...

13:06.316 --> 13:09.159

NO SENTIMENTAL VALUE.

13:09.159 --> 13:10.290
CHARLOTTE?

13:10.290 --> 13:12.162
THE SEAMSTRESS IS READY.

13:12.162 --> 13:13.363

13:30.340 --> 13:32.042
SEE YOU AROUND, CHARLOTTE.

13:39.219 --> 13:41.321
THE THINGS YOU'LL DO
TO TORTURE ME.

13:41.321 --> 13:44.154
IT'S NOT ALWAYS
ABOUT YOU, MOM.

13:50.330 --> 13:51.431
Hey, you've reached Daniel.

13:51.431 --> 13:53.263
Leave a message
and I'll call you back.

13:53.263 --> 13:54.334
(voice mail beeps)

13:54.334 --> 13:56.206
HEY, IT'S ALMOST 9:30,

13:56.206 --> 13:58.108

14:08.218 --> 14:10.150
EMILY.

14:13.183 --> 14:15.355
IT'S ABOUT TIME.

14:18.358 --> 14:20.090
(chuckles)

14:21.191 --> 14:22.362
THAT'S FUNNY.

14:22.362 --> 14:23.363
THAT'S WHAT I WAS THINKING
ON THE WAY OVER HERE.

14:23.363 --> 14:24.394
HI.

14:24.394 --> 14:26.436
THESE ARE FROM SAMMY,

14:26.436 --> 14:28.238
AS A WAY
OF SAYING THANK YOU

14:28.238 --> 14:30.340
FOR BRINGING HIM HOME
LAST WEEK...
 (Sammy whines)

14:30.340 --> 14:32.172
TWICE.

14:32.172 --> 14:34.344
WELL, THAT'S VERY NICE
OF SAMMY, BUT--

14:34.344 --> 14:37.147
OH.
I SHOULD'VE CALLED FIRST.

14:37.147 --> 14:38.278
YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE
OF SOMETHING.

14:38.278 --> 14:40.180
YES, I AM
IN THE MIDDLE OF SOMETHING,

14:40.180 --> 14:41.351
AND THAT HAPPENS TO BE

14:41.351 --> 14:44.354
AN EXCEPTIONALLY GOOD BOTTLE
OF PINOT.

14:44.354 --> 14:46.256
DO YOU DRINK WINE?

14:46.256 --> 14:48.258
WELL, WHEN IT'S EXCEPTIONAL,

14:48.258 --> 14:49.489
SURE.

14:49.489 --> 14:51.261
CHEERS.

14:58.398 --> 15:01.201
SO HAVE YOU
MADE ANY DECISIONS?

15:01.201 --> 15:03.373
ABOUT THE BAR, I MEAN.

15:03.373 --> 15:05.175
ACTUALLY, I'M, UH,

15:05.175 --> 15:07.207
I'M GONNA
HOLD ON TO IT FOR NOW.

15:07.207 --> 15:11.141
POSTPONE ANY MAJOR DECISIONS
TILL THE END OF THE SEASON.

15:11.141 --> 15:12.342
OH, WOW.

15:12.342 --> 15:14.144
WHY IS THAT?

15:14.144 --> 15:16.346
WELL, I GUESS I'M...

15:16.346 --> 15:17.447
JUST HOPING TO FIND

15:17.447 --> 15:20.150
A REALLY GOOD REASON
TO STICK AROUND.

15:20.150 --> 15:22.422
A BETTER REASON
THAN THE STOWAWAY?

15:22.422 --> 15:24.354
IF I'M LUCKY.

15:48.548 --> 15:51.551
(playing classical music)

15:51.551 --> 15:53.683
(indistinct conversations)

15:53.683 --> 15:57.327

15:57.327 --> 15:58.588

15:58.588 --> 16:00.330
MICHELLE.

16:00.330 --> 16:02.662
OH.
EVERYTHING IS EXQUISITE.

16:02.662 --> 16:04.534
BUT I'VE COME TO EXPECT
NOTHING LESS FROM YOU.

16:04.534 --> 16:07.367
OH, THANK YOU. WELL,
IT TAKES A VILLAGE, RIGHT?

16:07.367 --> 16:08.598
(laughs)
THE NARRATION YOU DID

16:08.598 --> 16:11.471
FOR THE VIDEO PRESENTATION
IS PERFECT.

16:11.471 --> 16:13.503
OH, I'M HAPPY TO DO
MY PART FOR THE CAUSE.

16:13.503 --> 16:15.675
OH, MICHELLE, YOU KNOW
MIRIAM AND EVERLY.

16:15.675 --> 16:17.707
OH, SHE OUGHT TO. I'M IN
HER OFFICE ONCE A WEEK.

16:17.707 --> 16:19.579
(all laugh)

16:19.579 --> 16:21.451
OH, EXCUSE ME.

16:21.451 --> 16:22.612

16:22.612 --> 16:24.454

THE PRESENTATION
IS ABOUT TO BEGIN,

16:27.387 --> 16:29.489

BY MY SIDE RIGHT NOW.

16:29.489 --> 16:32.462
PLEASE DO NOT DISAPPOINT ME
TODAY, I BEG OF YOU.

16:32.462 --> 16:33.693
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

16:33.693 --> 16:35.695
WOULDN'T DREAM OF IT.

16:35.695 --> 16:37.367
(beeps)

16:37.367 --> 16:38.468
(chuckles)

16:38.468 --> 16:39.629
THANK YOU.

16:39.629 --> 16:41.471

16:41.471 --> 16:42.532
(laughs)

16:42.532 --> 16:44.574
OH.

16:44.574 --> 16:45.675
(sighs)

16:45.675 --> 16:47.477
(exhales)

16:47.477 --> 16:48.678
HEY, ASH.

16:48.678 --> 16:50.510
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

16:50.510 --> 16:52.412
NO, EVERYTHING IS DEFINITELY
NOT OKAY.

16:52.412 --> 16:53.583
I'M AS HUNGOVER
AS A FRENCH SAILOR,

16:53.583 --> 16:55.415
AND NOW I'VE LOST
THE BLOODY DVD.

16:55.415 --> 16:56.646
OKAY. WELL, DON'T WORRY.
I'LL HELP YOU.

16:56.646 --> 16:58.518
IT WAS RIGHT HERE.

16:58.518 --> 16:59.519
DID YOU CHECK
THE DVD PLAYER?

16:59.519 --> 17:00.520
NO.

17:00.520 --> 17:02.622
FOUND IT.

17:02.622 --> 17:05.595
OH, THANK YOU. I AM
NEVER DRINKING AGAIN.

17:05.595 --> 17:09.459
I TAKE IT THAT YOU AND TYLER
HAD A GOOD TIME?

17:09.459 --> 17:10.730
MM. TOO MUCH.
HE IS A MADMAN.

17:10.730 --> 17:12.602
HOW WAS DINNER WITH DANIEL?

17:12.602 --> 17:14.534
IT WASN'T.
I GOT STOOD UP.

17:14.534 --> 17:16.465
AND NOW HE'S NOT ANSWERING
HIS PHONE.

17:16.465 --> 17:18.407
YOU'RE KIDDING.
PRINCE CHARMING?

17:18.407 --> 17:19.638
SOMETHING
MUST HAVE HAPPENED.

17:19.638 --> 17:21.570
I'M SURE, BUT WE CAN
TALK ABOUT THAT LATER

17:21.570 --> 17:25.675
BECAUSE YOU HAVE
SOME DAZZLING TO DO.

17:25.675 --> 17:28.417
EXCUSE ME.

17:28.417 --> 17:29.749
OH, GREAT.
NOW I'M HALLUCINATING.

17:29.749 --> 17:31.751
I'LL HANDLE HIM.

17:34.624 --> 17:36.686
(tires squeal)

17:36.686 --> 17:38.488
OH.

17:38.488 --> 17:39.629
I'M GETTING
PRETTY SICK OF YOU

17:39.629 --> 17:41.591
STICKING YOUR NOSE WHERE IT
DOESN'T BELONG, NOLAN.

17:41.591 --> 17:43.633
I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN WHISPERING
IN JACK PORTER'S EAR.

17:43.633 --> 17:44.634
(chuckles)

17:44.634 --> 17:46.536
DON'T INVOLVE HIM
IN THIS.

17:46.536 --> 17:49.539
I HEARD YOU TWO HAD
A PERFECTLY LOVELY EVENING

17:49.539 --> 17:50.770
AND...

17:50.770 --> 17:53.703
NICE TO KNOW YOU CAN LET
YOUR GUARD DOWN ONCE IN A WHILE.

17:53.703 --> 17:55.505
WHO KNEW YOU COULD COOK?

17:55.505 --> 17:58.648
(applause)

17:58.648 --> 17:59.779
(Victoria, voice amplified)
GOOD AFTERNOON, LADIES,

17:59.779 --> 18:03.483
AND WELCOME TO THE 15th ANNUAL
MOTHER-DAUGHTER TEA.

18:03.483 --> 18:04.584
SHOW'S STARTING.

18:04.584 --> 18:06.486

THIS MORNING,

18:38.518 --> 18:39.689

YOU WOKE UP CRAVING A DRINK?

19:34.574 --> 19:35.675
UH, NEVER.

FROM THIS STORAGE FACILITY

36:28.387 --> 36:29.588
JUST MOMENTS AGO.

36:29.588 --> 36:33.392
COPS HAVE BEEN ON THE SCENE,
COMBING THIS AREA FOR HOURS,

36:33.392 --> 36:36.325
TRYING TO GATHER UP EVIDENCE
AND LOOKING FOR SUSPECTS.

36:36.325 --> 36:39.398
WE DO KNOW THAT DR. BANKS
IS OKAY.

36:39.398 --> 36:40.599
WE HAVE NOT YET
BEEN ABLE TO--

36:40.599 --> 36:42.271
(turns tv off)

36:42.271 --> 36:44.373
SHE'S BEEN BY MY SIDE
THE WHOLE NIGHT.

36:44.373 --> 36:47.306
AND WHAT CAN YOU TELL ME
ABOUT WHERE THAT TIP CAME FROM?

36:47.306 --> 36:50.479
WELL, THANK YOU
FOR YOUR TIME, DETECTIVE.

36:52.311 --> 36:54.513
THEY'RE SAYING MICHELLE NEVER
GOT A LOOK AT HER ATTACKER,

36:54.513 --> 36:56.385
BUT THEY'RE GONNA WANT
TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU.

36:56.385 --> 36:58.387
WHY?

36:58.387 --> 37:00.449
BECAUSE THE STORAGE UNIT
THAT SHE WAS FOUND IN

37:00.449 --> 37:03.422
WAS REGISTERED
TO GRAYSON GLOBAL.

37:03.422 --> 37:05.394
WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON HERE, FRANK?

37:05.394 --> 37:07.396
I DON'T KNOW.

37:07.396 --> 37:09.428
BUT I'M GONNA GET
TO THE BOTTOM OF IT,

37:09.428 --> 37:10.559
I PROMISE.

37:13.602 --> 37:15.434
FRANK.

37:16.465 --> 37:18.507
WOULD YOU
SPEND THE NIGHT HERE?

37:19.638 --> 37:22.641
I DON'T WANT TO BE ALONE
IN THIS HOUSE.

37:25.474 --> 37:27.516
I MEAN, I ALWAYS KNEW
THINGS WERE WEIRD BETWEEN US,

37:27.516 --> 37:29.518
BUT I NEVER THOUGHT...

37:29.518 --> 37:31.320
(exhales deeply)
SHE ACTUALLY HATED ME.

37:31.320 --> 37:32.651
NAH, HEY, COME ON.
THAT'S NOT WHAT SHE SAID.

37:32.651 --> 37:34.353
YEAH, RIGHT.

37:34.353 --> 37:36.325
SHE SAID SHE WISHED
I HAD NEVER BEEN BORN,

37:36.325 --> 37:37.626
WHICH IS WORSE.

37:37.626 --> 37:39.628
I ALWAYS KNEW DANIEL
WAS HER FAVORITE.

37:39.628 --> 37:41.460
YEAH, ALL RIGHT, TRUST ME,

37:41.460 --> 37:43.332
I-I HAVE
AN OLDER BROTHER, TOO,

37:43.332 --> 37:45.364
SO I KNOW THE FEELING.

37:45.364 --> 37:47.436
ONLY NOW MINE'S MY GUARDIAN.

37:47.436 --> 37:48.597
(scoffs)

37:50.469 --> 37:52.501
SO WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR MOM?

37:52.501 --> 37:54.573
SHE LEFT.

37:54.573 --> 37:56.645
YEAH, WHEN I WAS, LIKE, 2.

37:58.447 --> 37:59.548
I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER HER.

37:59.548 --> 38:02.511
JACK DOES, BUT HE DOESN'T
TALK ABOUT HER.

38:02.511 --> 38:03.652
I DON'T KNOW.

38:03.652 --> 38:05.384
MAYBE THAT'S WHAT KEPT ME
FROM HOCKING HER RING.

38:05.384 --> 38:06.585
LIKE SOME
STUPID PART OF ME

38:06.585 --> 38:08.417
THINKS SHE'S GONNA
COME BACK FOR IT.

38:09.658 --> 38:11.520
CAN I SEE?

38:16.595 --> 38:17.666
WELL, IF IT MATTERS,

38:17.666 --> 38:19.468
YOU WOULDN'T
HAVE GOTTEN MUCH FOR IT.

38:19.468 --> 38:21.330
IT'S FAKE.

38:21.330 --> 38:24.333
(laughing)

38:27.676 --> 38:30.479
OH, IT FIGURES.
(chuckles)

38:30.479 --> 38:32.481
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S PRICELESS TO YOU,

38:32.481 --> 38:34.483
AND THAT'S
SO MUCH MORE IMPORTANT.

38:34.483 --> 38:36.545

38:40.649 --> 38:42.391
(beeps)

38:42.391 --> 38:43.392
HEY, UH,

38:43.392 --> 38:44.493
YOU SHOULD GO HOME

38:44.493 --> 38:46.555
AND WORK IT OUT
WITH YOUR MOM.

38:46.555 --> 38:48.457
AT LEAST YOU HAVE ONE,
RIGHT?

38:56.365 --> 38:58.567
(woman) DR. BANKS,
YOU MUST BE RELIEVED.

38:58.567 --> 39:00.569
I'LL BE RELIEVED
WHEN THE SICK PERSON

39:00.569 --> 39:02.411
WHO KNOCKED MY UNCONSCIOUS
AND LOCKED ME UP

39:02.411 --> 39:03.572
IS APPREHENDED.

39:03.572 --> 39:05.374
(woman) UNTIL THEN,

39:05.374 --> 39:08.447
IT SEEMS DR. BANKS WILL BE
LOOKING OVER HER SHOULDER

39:08.447 --> 39:10.549
WONDERING NOT IF, BUT WHEN

39:10.549 --> 39:12.581
HER ATTACKER
MIGHT STRIKE AGAIN.
