09:00.239 --> 09:02.341
THE FAIRY-CLIPSE
IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN.

09:02.408 --> 09:03.643
AND WHEN IT DOES...

09:03.709 --> 09:04.777
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH,

09:04.844 --> 09:06.078
WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT LATER.

09:06.145 --> 09:08.114
I'M FALLING IN LOVE.

09:09.382 --> 09:11.651
[screams]
- WELL, YOU'RE FALLING

09:11.717 --> 09:13.085
IN SOMETHING.

09:14.353 --> 09:17.356
[all scream]

09:18.424 --> 09:20.459
- YOU?
MR. CROCKER?

09:20.526 --> 09:21.894
- THAT'S RIGHT, TURNER.

09:21.961 --> 09:24.030
AND YOU GET AN "F"
FOR "FOOLED YOU"!

09:24.096 --> 09:25.731
CRUSH HIM, LOSERS.

09:25.798 --> 09:28.301
- THIS IS WAY MORE COMPLICATED
THAN THE DEATH BALL.

09:28.367 --> 09:30.436
I JUST HAVE
AN UPSY AND DOWNSY BUTTON.

09:30.503 --> 09:33.472
- I'LL HANDLE THIS.

09:35.675 --> 09:38.844
- [screams]

09:38.911 --> 09:40.680
- GOOD JOB, GUYS.

09:40.746 --> 09:41.981
WOW, WHAT A COUPLE
OF FREAKS.

09:42.048 --> 09:43.316
OH, DARN IT.

09:43.382 --> 09:45.184
THERE'S A RUN
IN MOTHER'S PANTYHOSE.

09:45.251 --> 09:47.653
- COSMO, WANDA,
HELP!

09:47.720 --> 09:49.822
POOF ME OUT OF HERE, GUYS.

09:51.958 --> 09:54.093
- UH-OH.

09:54.160 --> 09:55.428
IT'S THE FAIRY-CLIPSE.

09:57.964 --> 10:00.199
- WHO CARES
ABOUT THE FAIRY-CLIPSE?

10:00.266 --> 10:01.867
AND WHY AREN'T YOU FLOATING?

10:01.934 --> 10:03.436
- THAT'S WHAT I WAS TRYING
TO TELL YOU.

10:03.502 --> 10:06.205
WHEN THE SUN PASSES
BETWEEN THE FAIRY WORLDS

10:06.272 --> 10:08.607
AND THE EARTH,
IT BLOCKS THE BIG WANDS

10:08.674 --> 10:10.276
THAT GIVES FAIRIES
THEIR MAGIC.

10:10.343 --> 10:13.412
- AND THAT'S WHY WE EAT HAM
ON CHRISTMAS.

10:13.479 --> 10:14.747
- POOF-POOF.

10:14.814 --> 10:17.216
- POOF'S RIGHT.
THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH HAM.

10:17.283 --> 10:19.685
BUT UNTIL THE ECLIPSE ENDS
AT MIDNIGHT TOMORROW,

10:19.752 --> 10:22.989
WE WON'T HAVE ANY MAGIC.

10:23.055 --> 10:24.757
- NO!

10:31.931 --> 10:34.867
[evil laughter]

10:36.602 --> 10:37.903
- WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

10:37.970 --> 10:40.473
- WELL, WE COULD
EITHER GET SQUASHED LIKE BUGS

10:40.539 --> 10:42.942
OR I COULD JAM MY TITANIUM
THERMOS INTO THE CRUSHER.

10:43.009 --> 10:45.311
- WHY DO YOU HAVE
A TITANIUM THERMOS?

10:45.378 --> 10:49.081
- BECAUSE I GOT SICK
OF SPILLING MY CHOCOLATE MILK.

10:49.148 --> 10:51.083
ALSO I FIGURED IT WOULD COME IN
HANDY IF I EVER GOT SQUASHED

10:51.150 --> 10:52.184
BY A CAR CRUSHER.

10:52.251 --> 10:53.919
- JUST SAVE US!

10:55.521 --> 10:56.989
[machinery whining]

10:57.056 --> 10:58.924
[steam sound escalating]

10:58.991 --> 10:59.925
[evil laughter]

10:59.992 --> 11:01.093
[shaking]

11:01.160 --> 11:03.462
[screaming and grunts]

11:04.630 --> 11:06.499
- GAH!
TURNER'S GETTING AWAY.

11:06.565 --> 11:10.202
TO THE UNSUSPECTING VAN.

11:10.269 --> 11:11.303
- WAIT FOR ME.

11:11.370 --> 11:13.973
I LOST MY MAGIC.
TINY LEGS.

11:14.040 --> 11:17.443
- AAGH!

11:17.510 --> 11:19.879
- WAIT!

11:19.945 --> 11:22.348
[hollering]

11:22.415 --> 11:24.283
- [screaming]

11:24.350 --> 11:26.919
- BLAST HIM
WITH YOUR DEATH RAY.

11:26.986 --> 11:29.488
- DEATH RAY?
ON A TEACHER'S SALARY?

11:29.555 --> 11:31.190
I DON'T EVEN HAVE
FM RADIO.

11:31.257 --> 11:32.925
- AAGH!

11:32.992 --> 11:35.528
SKYDIVING'S NOT MY THING.

11:35.594 --> 11:38.397
- AAGH!

11:38.464 --> 11:41.967
[all screaming]

11:45.571 --> 11:50.042
- UGH, TRIXIE TANG
HAS REALLY LET HERSELF GO.

11:50.109 --> 11:51.677
GROUND HURTS.

11:51.744 --> 11:53.312
- OKAY, NOT GONNA PANIC.

11:53.379 --> 11:54.814
GOT TO STAY CALM.

11:54.880 --> 11:57.149
THE FAIRY-CLIPSE ONLY LASTS
UNTIL MIDNIGHT TOMORROW.

11:57.216 --> 11:59.618
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT DRAINED YOU
OF YOUR MAGIC.

11:59.685 --> 12:01.754
- DUH.
EVERYONE KNOWS THAT, TIMMY.

12:01.821 --> 12:05.257
JUST LIKE EVERYONE KNOWS YOU EAT
A GROUNDHOG ON GROUNDHOG DAY.

12:05.324 --> 12:06.859
- NO, YOU DON'T.

12:06.926 --> 12:08.761
- OH, NOW YOU TELL ME.

12:08.828 --> 12:10.296
[gags]

12:10.362 --> 12:11.831
[vomits]

12:11.897 --> 12:15.101
HEY, PUNXSUTAWNEY PHIL,
NO HARD FEELINGS?

12:15.167 --> 12:16.669
[exclaims]

12:16.735 --> 12:19.105
- OKAY, I MAY NOT BE ABLE
TO MAKE NEW WISHES,

12:19.171 --> 12:20.906
BUT MAYBE I CAN USE
SOME OF MY OLD ONES.

12:20.973 --> 12:22.341
LET'S SEE.
A CATAPULT.

12:22.408 --> 12:23.375
THAT'S A GOOD START.

12:23.442 --> 12:25.077
NOW ALL I NEED IS SOME AMMO.

12:25.144 --> 12:27.279
I'VE GOT MARSHMALLOWS,
A BOX OF FEATHERS.

12:27.346 --> 12:30.015
- A-CHOO!

12:30.082 --> 12:32.718
- COTTON BALLS.
NOT EXACTLY ARMED TO THE TEETH.

12:32.785 --> 12:36.055
- PHIL'S GOT MY ARM
IN HIS TEETH. AAGH!

12:36.122 --> 12:38.958
- TURNER GETTING AWAY
WAS A BIT OF A SETBACK,

12:39.024 --> 12:40.392
BUT, ON THE BRIGHT SIDE,

12:40.459 --> 12:43.095
OUR T-SHIRTS CAME IN.

12:43.162 --> 12:45.831
OKAY, WE NEED A NEW PLAN
TO ANNIHILATE TURNER.

12:45.898 --> 12:47.600
ANYBODY?
- I KNOW!

12:47.666 --> 12:50.302
HAS ANYONE EVER HEARD OF
A VENUSIAN FACE-EATING SPIDER?

12:50.369 --> 12:52.037
- DO THEY ACTUALLY EAT
PEOPLE'S FACES?

12:52.104 --> 12:54.974
- OH, THE FACE
IS JUST THE APPETIZER.

12:55.040 --> 12:56.742
[laughs wickedly]

12:56.809 --> 12:58.878
- YOU'RE THE SCARIEST BABY
I'VE EVER MET.

12:58.944 --> 13:00.479
- I GET THAT A LOT.

13:00.546 --> 13:05.084
ANYWAY, I'VE GOT A SHOE BOX
FULL OF FACE-EATERS RIGHT HERE.

13:05.151 --> 13:07.620
OOPS. I FORGOT TO PUNCH
AIR HOLES IN IT.

13:07.686 --> 13:09.221
ANYBODY ELSE GOT A PLAN?

13:09.288 --> 13:11.590
- HOW ABOUT WE CAPTURE TURNER
IN MY DEATH BALL,

13:11.657 --> 13:13.759
FLY HIM TO THE OUTER REACHES
OF THE GALAXY,

13:13.826 --> 13:15.961
AND DROP HIM
INTO A BLACK HOLE?

13:16.028 --> 13:17.863
- EH, SEEMS A LITTLE ELABORATE.

13:17.930 --> 13:20.666
CAN'T WE JUST MAKE HIM A
SANDWICH WITH SOME BAD PASTRAMI?

13:20.733 --> 13:21.901
- WE'LL PUT IT TO A VOTE.

13:21.967 --> 13:24.904
ALL IN FAVOR
OF THE BLACK HOLE IDEA...

13:24.970 --> 13:26.705
- [barks]

13:26.772 --> 13:29.875
- FINE. BUT I'M MAKING
THE SANDWICH AS A BACKUP.

13:29.942 --> 13:31.810
I CAN ALWAYS GIVE IT TO MOTHER
IF SHE GETS ON MY BACK

13:31.877 --> 13:33.612
ABOUT THE TORN PANTYHOSE.

13:33.679 --> 13:37.917
- [grunts]

13:37.983 --> 13:41.554
OKAY, MY TREE HOUSE
IS NOW OFFICIALLY A SAFE HOUSE.

13:41.620 --> 13:42.855
[thuds and exclamations]

13:42.922 --> 13:44.190
- WHAT'S HAPPENING?

13:44.256 --> 13:45.824
- FIRE THE CATAPULT!

13:45.891 --> 13:48.227
- WE CAN'T.
POOF ATE THE AMMO.

13:50.029 --> 13:55.367
- I JOINED A LUMBERJACK CLUB,
TIMMY.

13:55.434 --> 14:00.639
TIMBER.

14:00.706 --> 14:02.107
OOPS.

14:02.174 --> 14:04.343
I WONDER IF THERE'S
A HIDE FROM THE POLICE CLUB.

14:04.410 --> 14:05.711
BYE, TIMMY.
I'VE GOT TO GET

14:05.778 --> 14:07.279
DINKLEBERG'S PRINTS
ON THIS AXE.

14:07.346 --> 14:10.015
[all shout]

14:10.082 --> 14:11.517
- [screams]

14:11.584 --> 14:12.718
HELP!

14:12.785 --> 14:14.220
- HANG IN THERE, TIMMY.

14:14.286 --> 14:16.455
WE'LL SAVE YOU AS SOON
AS WE GET OUR MAGIC BACK.

14:16.522 --> 14:19.124
- THAT WON'T BE
FOR ANOTHER 14 HOURS!

14:19.191 --> 14:21.360
- I'M NOT SAYING
IT'S A PERFECT PLAN.

14:21.427 --> 14:24.563
- [hollers]

14:28.500 --> 14:31.804
WAIT. YOU GUYS ARE CALLING
YOURSELVES THE LOSERS?

14:31.870 --> 14:35.341
- IT STANDS FOR LEAGUE
OF SUPER EVIL REVENGE SEEKERS.

14:35.407 --> 14:37.409
- APPROACHING BLACK HOLE.

14:37.476 --> 14:39.411
- WE KNOW YOU'RE DOING
THAT VOICE.

14:39.478 --> 14:41.380
- NO, I'M NOT.
[beeping]

14:41.447 --> 14:42.881
[evil laughter]

14:42.948 --> 14:45.784
- FINALLY, WE'LL BE RID
OF TIMMY TURNER FOREVER.

14:45.851 --> 14:47.686
I'D HIGH-FIVE,
BUT MY ARMS ARE TOO SHORT.

14:47.753 --> 14:49.688
- TURNER, DO YOU HAVE
ANY LAST WORDS

14:49.755 --> 14:51.824
BEFORE WE DROP YOU
INTO THE VOID?

14:51.890 --> 14:53.959
- UM, CAN'T WE
JUST TALK THIS OVER?

14:54.026 --> 14:55.327
FOR 14 HOURS?

14:55.394 --> 14:56.528
- NO, WE CAN'T.

14:56.595 --> 14:58.030
OPENING HATCH.

14:58.097 --> 14:59.832
- AND I THOUGHT
HIS TOY DOG WAS WEIRD.

14:59.898 --> 15:01.433
- TOY DOG.
THAT'S IT.

15:01.500 --> 15:04.036
FLIPSY!
- [laughs wickedly]

15:04.103 --> 15:05.437
WATCH THIS, FLIPSY.

15:08.240 --> 15:10.643
- AAGH!

15:14.513 --> 15:16.949
- FLIPSY!
NO!

15:17.016 --> 15:17.916
I'LL SAVE YOU.

15:17.983 --> 15:20.052
SAVE HIM!

15:20.119 --> 15:22.021
[both shouting]

15:22.087 --> 15:24.823
I PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE TIED
A ROPE TO THEM.

15:24.890 --> 15:25.858
HANG ON, FLIPSY.

15:25.924 --> 15:28.527
DADDY'S COMING.
WAH!

15:28.594 --> 15:31.797
I PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE TIED
MYSELF TO SOMETHING.

15:31.864 --> 15:34.767
- LATER, LOSERS.

15:36.335 --> 15:38.470
YAHOO!

15:39.738 --> 15:41.507
[all screaming]

15:41.573 --> 15:43.175
- I WONDER
WHERE BLACK HOLES TAKE YOU.

15:43.242 --> 15:46.178
[screaming]

15:47.880 --> 15:49.081
BAKERSFIELD.

15:49.148 --> 15:50.749
SO EINSTEIN WAS RIGHT.

15:50.816 --> 15:52.184
- TURNER HAS MY SHIP.

15:52.251 --> 15:53.819
WE'LL HAVE TO TAKE THE BUS
BACK TO DIMMSDALE.

15:53.886 --> 15:55.354
[bus horn honks]

15:55.421 --> 15:56.822
[all groan]

15:56.889 --> 15:58.490
- [growls]

15:58.557 --> 16:01.493
[screaming]

16:04.229 --> 16:06.965
- OH, I CAN'T BELIEVE
TURNER GOT AWAY AGAIN.

16:07.032 --> 16:08.267
ON THE BRIGHT SIDE,

16:08.334 --> 16:10.469
WE STILL GET
THE 10% BEAR ATTACK DISCOUNT.

16:10.536 --> 16:11.937
- WE FAILED.
FACE IT.

16:12.004 --> 16:13.238
THE LOSERS ARE A BUNCH OF...

16:13.305 --> 16:14.406
WHAT'S THE WORD?

16:14.473 --> 16:15.941
- YES.
WHAT IS THAT WORD?

16:16.008 --> 16:17.409
IT'S ON THE TIP
OF MY TONGUE?

16:17.476 --> 16:19.478
- NO, THAT'S
THE FACE-EATING SPIDER.

16:20.879 --> 16:23.482
- AAGH!
IT'S ALIVE! AAGH!

16:23.549 --> 16:25.184
- IT'S NO USE.

16:25.250 --> 16:26.518
WE'LL NEVER GET TURNER.

16:26.585 --> 16:28.320
EVEN FLIPSY'S LOST HOPE.

16:28.387 --> 16:29.822
- [whimpers]
- GOOD NEWS!

16:29.888 --> 16:31.690
I DROWNED THE SPIDER
IN A ROOT BEER FLOAT.

16:31.757 --> 16:33.425
LUCKILY, I GOT HIM
BEFORE HE BIT ME.

16:33.492 --> 16:36.729
- WAIT A MINUTE, I THINK I KNOW
SOMEONE WHO CAN HELP US.

16:36.795 --> 16:39.998
SOMEONE SO HIDEOUSLY EVIL,
SHE STRIKES FEAR

16:40.065 --> 16:42.134
IN THE HEARTS
OF EVERYONE SHE ENCOUNTERS.

16:42.201 --> 16:44.002
- IS SHE SINGLE?
- LEGEND HAS IT

16:44.069 --> 16:45.371
SHE'LL MAGICALLY APPEAR

16:45.437 --> 16:48.374
IF YOU MENTION HER NAME
IN A CHEAP DINER.

16:48.440 --> 16:49.775
VICKY.

16:51.176 --> 16:53.312
[all scream]

16:55.280 --> 16:57.883
- WHAT DO YOU LOSERS WANT?

16:57.950 --> 17:01.019
- WE WANT TIMMY TURNER'S HEAD
ON A PLATTER.

17:01.086 --> 17:02.554
- AND A MANGO ICED TEA.

17:02.621 --> 17:05.891
- SO YOU WANT TO DESTROY
THE TWERP AND YOU NEED MY HELP.

17:05.958 --> 17:08.894
- WAIT, WHY WOULD WE LISTEN
TO A MERE TEENAGE GIRL?

17:10.462 --> 17:12.431
- [growls]

17:14.031 --> 17:15.000
- [growls]

17:15.067 --> 17:17.536
- [whimpers]

17:17.603 --> 17:19.171
- YOU'RE HIRED.

17:19.238 --> 17:20.873
- YES, WE'LL GIVE YOU
A TEAM T-SHIRT

17:20.939 --> 17:23.742
AND YOUR STANDARD BABYSITTING
FEE OF $11.50 AN HOUR.

17:23.809 --> 17:24.943
- KEEP YOUR MONEY.

17:25.010 --> 17:26.612
I'LL HELP YOU
ANNIHILATE TIMMY

17:26.678 --> 17:28.347
FOR THE SHEER JOY OF IT.

17:28.414 --> 17:30.182
- OOH, I LIKE YOU.

17:30.249 --> 17:32.551
- NEVER LOOK IN THE EYES!

17:32.618 --> 17:35.020
- AAGH!
I'M BLIND.

17:35.087 --> 17:38.123
- TIME TO WHIP YOU WIMPS
INTO SHAPE.

17:38.190 --> 17:40.192
[all screaming]

17:40.259 --> 17:41.827
- [laughs wickedly]

17:43.462 --> 17:45.464
COME ON, YOU LOSERS.

17:45.531 --> 17:47.332
[all grunting]

17:47.399 --> 17:50.702
[all screaming]

17:50.769 --> 17:54.039
- THIS IS VERY EMBARRASSING.

17:55.407 --> 17:57.209
- [blows whistle]

17:57.276 --> 18:01.580
[all shouting]

18:01.647 --> 18:03.982
[all screaming]

18:04.049 --> 18:07.486
[laughs wickedly]

18:07.553 --> 18:10.055
CONGRATULATIONS, MAGGOTS.

18:10.122 --> 18:11.089
YOU'RE READY.

18:11.156 --> 18:12.090
- EXCELLENT.

18:12.157 --> 18:13.459
NOW WHAT'S THE PLAN?

18:13.525 --> 18:15.994
I KNOW. WE'LL BUY
A GIANT FLAT-SCREEN TV,

18:16.061 --> 18:18.197
THROW OUT THE TV, AND DISGUISE
THE BOX AS A VIDEO ARCADE

18:18.263 --> 18:19.965
TO LURE TURNER INSIDE.

18:20.032 --> 18:21.233
- THEN WE'LL TAPE THE BOX SHUT,

18:21.300 --> 18:23.068
DRAG IT TO THE BASE
OF MOUNT DIMMSDALE,

18:23.135 --> 18:24.336
AND START
AN AVALANCHE.

18:24.403 --> 18:26.405
- AND ONCE HE'S BURIED ALIVE,

18:26.472 --> 18:28.540
WE'LL DIG HIM UP
AND PUNCH HIM.

18:28.607 --> 18:30.242
- THAT'S JUST COMPLICATED.

18:30.309 --> 18:31.477
AND STUPID.

18:31.543 --> 18:32.978
IT'S FOUR AGAINST ONE.

18:33.045 --> 18:35.714
LET'S JUST STRAIGHT UP
DESTROY HIM.

18:35.781 --> 18:38.584
- OH, I REALLY LIKE HER.

18:38.650 --> 18:40.152
- OH, SHE'S A DELIGHT.

18:40.219 --> 18:42.187
- THE EYES!

18:42.254 --> 18:45.824
- ONLY HALF AN HOUR
TILL THE FAIRY-CLIPSE ENDS.

18:45.891 --> 18:48.494
- AND I CAN FINALLY POOF
THIS GROUNDHOG OFF MY LEG.

18:48.560 --> 18:50.996
I THINK
HE GAVE ME RABIES.

18:51.063 --> 18:52.030
- HALF AN HOUR.

18:52.097 --> 18:53.732
I'M GONNA MAKE IT.
- YEAH.

18:53.799 --> 18:56.201
THE ONLY WAY THOSE LOSERS
COULD POSSIBLY GET YOU NOW

18:56.268 --> 18:57.569
IS IF THEY TEAMED UP
WITH SOMEBODY

18:57.636 --> 18:58.971
EVEN MORE EVIL
THAN THEY ARE.

18:59.037 --> 19:01.206
BUT WHAT ARE THE ODDS OF THAT?

19:02.608 --> 19:04.076
- AAGH!
VICKY?

19:04.142 --> 19:06.111
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH THEM?

19:06.178 --> 19:07.479
- THEY BROUGHT ME IN

19:07.546 --> 19:08.981
TO TAKE YOU OUT.

19:09.047 --> 19:12.050
AND THAT'S
JUST WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO, TWERP.

19:12.117 --> 19:13.552
[laughs wickedly]

19:13.619 --> 19:15.320
- AAGH!

19:18.757 --> 19:20.459
YAAGH!

19:24.730 --> 19:25.764
- POOF-POOF!

19:25.831 --> 19:26.865
- YOU'RE RIGHT, POOF.

19:26.932 --> 19:28.600
WE HAVE TO SAVE TIMMY.

19:28.667 --> 19:31.069
- LOOK.
I CAN BLOW BUBBLES.

19:31.136 --> 19:32.538
OOH.

19:32.604 --> 19:35.440
ALSO MY KIDNEYS
ARE SHUTTING DOWN.

19:35.507 --> 19:37.042
- AAGH!
- YOU CAN RUN, TURNER,

19:37.109 --> 19:38.911
BUT YOU CAN'T HIDE.

19:38.977 --> 19:41.547
- [exclaims]

19:41.613 --> 19:44.416
- THIS IS FOR FLIPSY.

19:44.483 --> 19:46.785
- AAGH!

19:48.253 --> 19:50.489
AAGH!

19:52.090 --> 19:54.593
- [hollers]

19:54.660 --> 19:56.995
- WHAT HAVE I DONE?
- [groans]

19:57.062 --> 19:58.664
- [exclaims]

19:58.730 --> 19:59.932
POISON IVY!

19:59.998 --> 20:01.466
- AAGH!

20:01.533 --> 20:04.970
- I GIVE YOU AN "F"
FOR "FINISHED".

20:06.939 --> 20:09.074
OR MAYBE IT WAS TWO "F"S
FOR "FRIED FOOP".

20:09.141 --> 20:11.476
- AAGH!
GUYS!

20:11.543 --> 20:12.778
HOW DID YOU GET HERE?

20:12.844 --> 20:14.146
- WE TOOK THE BEAR BUS.

20:14.212 --> 20:15.614
- [growls]

20:15.681 --> 20:16.615
[bus horn honks]

20:16.682 --> 20:18.016
- I CAN'T RUN MUCH MORE.

20:18.083 --> 20:20.752
HOW LONG
TILL THE FAIRY-CLIPSE ENDS?

20:20.819 --> 20:22.721
- ONE MORE MINUTE, SPORT.

20:22.788 --> 20:25.190
- WE'RE COMING FOR YOU,
TWERP!

20:25.257 --> 20:26.325
- I HAVE A PLAN.

20:26.391 --> 20:27.960
THE SECOND
THE FAIRY-CLIPSE ENDS,

20:28.026 --> 20:29.528
HERE'S WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO.

20:29.595 --> 20:30.696
[whispers]

20:35.901 --> 20:38.203
[cheers]

20:38.270 --> 20:40.839
- NOW TO GRANT
TIMMY'S WISH.

20:44.242 --> 20:46.311
- [panting]

20:46.378 --> 20:48.914
[grunts]

20:48.981 --> 20:51.617
WAIT, VIOLENCE NEVER SOLVED
ANYTHING.

20:51.683 --> 20:54.052
CAN'T WE SETTLE THIS
WITH A GAME OF DODGE BALL?

20:54.119 --> 20:55.787
UGH.
OR MAYBE CHECKERS?

20:55.854 --> 20:57.422
UGH.
AH, COME ON.

20:57.489 --> 20:58.624
THAT'S NOT HOW YOU PLAY.

20:58.690 --> 21:01.927
NO!

21:05.364 --> 21:08.333
- [barks]
- HEH! I GOT YOU, TWERP.

21:08.400 --> 21:09.735
WAIT.
WHY DO I SOUND LIKE TIMMY?

21:12.804 --> 21:14.573
- HA, YOU GET AN "F", TURNER

21:14.640 --> 21:16.875
FOR "FEEL MY WRATH".

21:16.942 --> 21:18.377
AAGH, I THOUGHT
I DESTROYED YOU.

21:18.443 --> 21:19.878
- IN YOUR DREAMS, TURNER.

21:19.945 --> 21:22.414
IT IS I, FOOP,
WHO WILL DESTROY YOU.

21:22.481 --> 21:24.750
- THEN YOU GET AN "F"
FOR "FAT CHANCE"!

21:27.319 --> 21:29.588
- GUYS, WE DID IT!

21:29.655 --> 21:31.089
- POOF-POOF!

21:31.156 --> 21:32.991
- THAT WAS A GREAT IDEA,
SPORT.

21:33.058 --> 21:35.694
WISHING TO TURN YOUR ENEMIES
INTO TIMMY LOOKALIKES

21:35.761 --> 21:38.063
TRICKED THEM
INTO ANNIHILATING EACH OTHER.

21:38.130 --> 21:39.865
- OH, IS THAT
WHAT WE WERE DOING?

21:39.931 --> 21:41.700
I THOUGHT
WE WERE PLAYING CHECKERS.

21:41.767 --> 21:44.102
ALSO MY LUNGS ARE FILLED
WITH FLUID.

21:44.169 --> 21:46.338
- THANK GOODNESS
THE FAIRY-CLIPSE ENDED

21:46.405 --> 21:47.572
BEFORE THEY GOT YOU.

21:47.639 --> 21:48.840
- AND WE WON'T HAVE TO WORRY

21:48.907 --> 21:50.876
ABOUT ANOTHER ONE
FOR A MILLION YEARS.

21:50.942 --> 21:54.513
- WELL, THERE IS THE UPCOMING
AURORA FAIRY-ALIS

21:54.579 --> 21:57.649
WHEN THE EARTH'S MAGNETIC FIELDS
BLOCK THE BIG WANDS

21:57.716 --> 21:59.184
FOR 28 WEEKS.

21:59.251 --> 22:01.253
- AND THAT'S
WHY WE EAT SAUERKRAUT

22:01.319 --> 22:03.155
ON GERMAN UNIFICATION DAY.

22:03.221 --> 22:05.257
- HEY, COSMO'S RIGHT
THIS TIME.

22:05.323 --> 22:07.225
- YAY!

22:07.292 --> 22:10.228
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
WE BLEW IT AGAIN.

22:10.295 --> 22:11.596
YOU'RE FIRED, VICKY.

22:11.663 --> 22:15.567
- FINE. BUT I'M COMING BACK
WITH THE BEAR.

22:15.634 --> 22:16.935
- IF WE'RE GOING
TO DESTROY TURNER,

22:17.002 --> 22:18.403
WE'LL NEED A WAY
INTO HIS HOUSE.

22:18.470 --> 22:21.306
- I THINK THE NEW GUY
MAY BE ABLE TO HELP WITH THAT.

22:21.373 --> 22:22.541
[bell on door jingles]

22:22.607 --> 22:23.909
- HI, FELLAS!

22:23.975 --> 22:26.078
THANKS FOR LETTING ME JOIN
YOUR CLUB.

22:26.144 --> 22:28.080
WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU GUYS DO
ANYWAY?

22:28.146 --> 22:29.881
- JUST GIVE US YOUR HOUSE KEYS
AND WE'LL TELL YOU.

22:29.948 --> 22:32.718
- HEY, THERE'S A SPIDER
IN MY ROOT BEER FLOAT.

22:32.784 --> 22:34.352
AAGH!

22:34.419 --> 22:35.987
- MY EYES ARE NUMB.

22:45.063 --> 22:47.999
[evil laughter]

22:49.735 --> 22:51.036
- WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

22:51.103 --> 22:53.605
- WELL, WE COULD
EITHER GET SQUASHED LIKE BUGS

22:53.672 --> 22:56.074
OR I COULD JAM MY TITANIUM
THERMOS INTO THE CRUSHER.

22:56.141 --> 22:58.443
- WHY DO YOU HAVE
A TITANIUM THERMOS?

22:58.510 --> 23:02.214
- BECAUSE I GOT SICK
OF SPILLING MY CHOCOLATE MILK.

23:02.280 --> 23:04.216
ALSO I FIGURED IT WOULD COME IN
HANDY IF I EVER GOT SQUASHED

23:04.282 --> 23:05.317
BY A CAR CRUSHER.

23:05.383 --> 23:07.052
- JUST SAVE US!

23:08.653 --> 23:10.122
[machinery whining]

23:10.188 --> 23:12.057
[steam sound escalating]

23:12.124 --> 23:13.058
[evil laughter]

23:13.125 --> 23:14.226
[shaking]

23:14.292 --> 23:16.595
[screaming and grunts]

23:17.763 --> 23:19.631
- GAH!
TURNER'S GETTING AWAY.

23:19.698 --> 23:23.335
TO THE UNSUSPECTING VAN.

23:23.401 --> 23:24.436
- WAIT FOR ME.

23:24.503 --> 23:27.105
I LOST MY MAGIC.
TINY LEGS.

23:27.172 --> 23:30.575
- AAGH!

23:30.642 --> 23:33.011
- WAIT!

23:33.078 --> 23:35.480
[hollering]

23:35.547 --> 23:37.415
- [screaming]

23:37.482 --> 23:40.051
- BLAST HIM
WITH YOUR DEATH RAY.

23:40.118 --> 23:42.621
- DEATH RAY?
ON A TEACHER'S SALARY?

23:42.687 --> 23:44.322
I DON'T EVEN HAVE
FM RADIO.

23:44.389 --> 23:46.057
- AAGH!

23:46.124 --> 23:48.660
SKYDIVING'S NOT MY THING.

23:48.727 --> 23:51.530
- AAGH!

23:51.596 --> 23:55.100
[all screaming]

23:58.703 --> 24:03.175
- UGH, TRIXIE TANG
HAS REALLY LET HERSELF GO.

24:03.241 --> 24:04.810
GROUND HURTS.

24:04.876 --> 24:06.444
- OKAY, NOT GONNA PANIC.

24:06.511 --> 24:07.946
GOT TO STAY CALM.

24:08.013 --> 24:10.282
THE FAIRY-CLIPSE ONLY LASTS
UNTIL MIDNIGHT TOMORROW.

24:10.348 --> 24:12.751
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT DRAINED YOU
OF YOUR MAGIC.

24:12.818 --> 24:14.886
- DUH.
EVERYONE KNOWS THAT, TIMMY.

24:14.953 --> 24:18.390
JUST LIKE EVERYONE KNOWS YOU EAT
A GROUNDHOG ON GROUNDHOG DAY.

24:18.456 --> 24:19.991
- NO, YOU DON'T.

24:20.058 --> 24:21.893
- OH, NOW YOU TELL ME.

24:21.960 --> 24:23.428
[gags]

24:23.495 --> 24:24.963
[vomits]

24:25.030 --> 24:28.233
HEY, PUNXSUTAWNEY PHIL,
NO HARD FEELINGS?

24:28.300 --> 24:29.801
[exclaims]

24:29.868 --> 24:32.237
- OKAY, I MAY NOT BE ABLE
TO MAKE NEW WISHES,

24:32.304 --> 24:34.039
BUT MAYBE I CAN USE
SOME OF MY OLD ONES.

24:34.105 --> 24:35.473
LET'S SEE.
A CATAPULT.

24:35.540 --> 24:36.508
THAT'S A GOOD START.

24:36.575 --> 24:38.210
NOW ALL I NEED IS SOME AMMO.

24:38.276 --> 24:40.412
I'VE GOT MARSHMALLOWS,
A BOX OF FEATHERS.

24:40.478 --> 24:43.148
- A-CHOO!

24:43.215 --> 24:45.851
- COTTON BALLS.
NOT EXACTLY ARMED TO THE TEETH.

24:45.917 --> 24:49.187
- PHIL'S GOT MY ARM
IN HIS TEETH. AAGH!

24:49.254 --> 24:52.090
- TURNER GETTING AWAY
WAS A BIT OF A SETBACK,

24:52.157 --> 24:53.525
BUT, ON THE BRIGHT SIDE,

24:53.592 --> 24:56.228
OUR T-SHIRTS CAME IN.

24:56.294 --> 24:58.964
OKAY, WE NEED A NEW PLAN
TO ANNIHILATE TURNER.

24:59.030 --> 25:00.732
ANYBODY?
- I KNOW!

25:00.799 --> 25:03.435
HAS ANYONE EVER HEARD OF
A VENUSIAN FACE-EATING SPIDER?

25:03.501 --> 25:05.170
- DO THEY ACTUALLY EAT
PEOPLE'S FACES?

25:05.237 --> 25:08.106
- OH, THE FACE
IS JUST THE APPETIZER.

25:08.173 --> 25:09.875
[laughs wickedly]

25:09.941 --> 25:12.010
- YOU'RE THE SCARIEST BABY
I'VE EVER MET.

25:12.077 --> 25:13.612
- I GET THAT A LOT.

25:13.678 --> 25:18.216
ANYWAY, I'VE GOT A SHOE BOX
FULL OF FACE-EATERS RIGHT HERE.

25:18.283 --> 25:20.752
OOPS. I FORGOT TO PUNCH
AIR HOLES IN IT.

25:20.819 --> 25:22.354
ANYBODY ELSE GOT A PLAN?

25:22.420 --> 25:24.723
- HOW ABOUT WE CAPTURE TURNER
IN MY DEATH BALL,

25:24.789 --> 25:26.892
FLY HIM TO THE OUTER REACHES
OF THE GALAXY,

25:26.958 --> 25:29.094
AND DROP HIM
INTO A BLACK HOLE?

25:29.160 --> 25:30.996
- EH, SEEMS A LITTLE ELABORATE.

25:31.062 --> 25:33.798
CAN'T WE JUST MAKE HIM A
SANDWICH WITH SOME BAD PASTRAMI?

25:33.865 --> 25:35.033
- WE'LL PUT IT TO A VOTE.

25:35.100 --> 25:38.036
ALL IN FAVOR
OF THE BLACK HOLE IDEA...

25:38.103 --> 25:39.838
- [barks]

25:39.905 --> 25:43.008
- FINE. BUT I'M MAKING
THE SANDWICH AS A BACKUP.

25:43.074 --> 25:44.943
I CAN ALWAYS GIVE IT TO MOTHER
IF SHE GETS ON MY BACK

25:45.010 --> 25:46.745
ABOUT THE TORN PANTYHOSE.

25:46.811 --> 25:51.049
- [grunts]

25:51.116 --> 25:54.686
OKAY, MY TREE HOUSE
IS NOW OFFICIALLY A SAFE HOUSE.

25:54.753 --> 25:55.987
[thuds and exclamations]

25:56.054 --> 25:57.322
- WHAT'S HAPPENING?

25:57.389 --> 25:58.957
- FIRE THE CATAPULT!

25:59.024 --> 26:01.359
- WE CAN'T.
POOF ATE THE AMMO.

26:03.161 --> 26:08.500
- I JOINED A LUMBERJACK CLUB,
TIMMY.

26:08.566 --> 26:13.772
TIMBER.

26:13.838 --> 26:15.240
OOPS.

26:15.307 --> 26:17.475
I WONDER IF THERE'S
A HIDE FROM THE POLICE CLUB.

26:17.542 --> 26:18.843
BYE, TIMMY.
I'VE GOT TO GET

26:18.910 --> 26:20.412
DINKLEBERG'S PRINTS
ON THIS AXE.

26:20.478 --> 26:23.148
[all shout]

26:23.214 --> 26:24.649
- [screams]

26:24.716 --> 26:25.850
HELP!

26:25.917 --> 26:27.352
- HANG IN THERE, TIMMY.

26:27.419 --> 26:29.587
WE'LL SAVE YOU AS SOON
AS WE GET OUR MAGIC BACK.

26:29.654 --> 26:32.257
- THAT WON'T BE
FOR ANOTHER 14 HOURS!

26:32.324 --> 26:34.492
- I'M NOT SAYING
IT'S A PERFECT PLAN.

26:34.559 --> 26:37.696
- [hollers]

26:41.633 --> 26:44.936
WAIT. YOU GUYS ARE CALLING
YOURSELVES THE LOSERS?

26:45.003 --> 26:48.473
- IT STANDS FOR LEAGUE
OF SUPER EVIL REVENGE SEEKERS.

26:48.540 --> 26:50.542
- APPROACHING BLACK HOLE.

26:50.608 --> 26:52.544
- WE KNOW YOU'RE DOING
THAT VOICE.

26:52.610 --> 26:54.512
- NO, I'M NOT.
[beeping]

26:54.579 --> 26:56.014
[evil laughter]

26:56.081 --> 26:58.917
- FINALLY, WE'LL BE RID
OF TIMMY TURNER FOREVER.

26:58.984 --> 27:00.819
I'D HIGH-FIVE,
BUT MY ARMS ARE TOO SHORT.

27:00.885 --> 27:02.821
- TURNER, DO YOU HAVE
ANY LAST WORDS

27:02.887 --> 27:04.956
BEFORE WE DROP YOU
INTO THE VOID?

27:05.023 --> 27:07.092
- UM, CAN'T WE
JUST TALK THIS OVER?

27:07.158 --> 27:08.460
FOR 14 HOURS?

27:08.526 --> 27:09.661
- NO, WE CAN'T.

27:09.728 --> 27:11.162
OPENING HATCH.

27:11.229 --> 27:12.964
- AND I THOUGHT
HIS TOY DOG WAS WEIRD.

27:13.031 --> 27:14.566
- TOY DOG.
THAT'S IT.

27:14.632 --> 27:17.168
FLIPSY!
- [laughs wickedly]

27:17.235 --> 27:18.570
WATCH THIS, FLIPSY.

27:21.373 --> 27:23.775
- AAGH!

27:27.645 --> 27:30.081
- FLIPSY!
NO!

27:30.148 --> 27:31.049
I'LL SAVE YOU.

27:31.116 --> 27:33.184
SAVE HIM!

27:33.251 --> 27:35.153
[both shouting]

27:35.220 --> 27:37.956
I PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE TIED
A ROPE TO THEM.

27:38.023 --> 27:38.990
HANG ON, FLIPSY.

27:39.057 --> 27:41.659
DADDY'S COMING.
WAH!

27:41.726 --> 27:44.929
I PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE TIED
MYSELF TO SOMETHING.

27:44.996 --> 27:47.899
- LATER, LOSERS.

27:49.467 --> 27:51.603
YAHOO!

27:52.871 --> 27:54.639
[all screaming]

27:54.706 --> 27:56.307
- I WONDER
WHERE BLACK HOLES TAKE YOU.

27:56.374 --> 27:59.310
[screaming]

28:01.012 --> 28:02.213
BAKERSFIELD.

28:02.280 --> 28:03.882
SO EINSTEIN WAS RIGHT.

28:03.948 --> 28:05.316
- TURNER HAS MY SHIP.

28:05.383 --> 28:06.951
WE'LL HAVE TO TAKE THE BUS
BACK TO DIMMSDALE.

28:07.018 --> 28:08.486
[bus horn honks]

28:08.553 --> 28:09.954
[all groan]

28:10.021 --> 28:11.623
- [growls]

28:11.689 --> 28:14.626
[screaming]

28:17.362 --> 28:20.098
- OH, I CAN'T BELIEVE
TURNER GOT AWAY AGAIN.

28:20.165 --> 28:21.399
ON THE BRIGHT SIDE,

28:21.466 --> 28:23.601
WE STILL GET
THE 10% BEAR ATTACK DISCOUNT.

28:23.668 --> 28:25.070
- WE FAILED.
FACE IT.

28:25.136 --> 28:26.371
THE LOSERS ARE A BUNCH OF...

28:26.438 --> 28:27.539
WHAT'S THE WORD?

28:27.605 --> 28:29.074
- YES.
WHAT IS THAT WORD?

28:29.140 --> 28:30.542
IT'S ON THE TIP
OF MY TONGUE?

28:30.608 --> 28:32.610
- NO, THAT'S
THE FACE-EATING SPIDER.

28:34.012 --> 28:36.614
- AAGH!
IT'S ALIVE! AAGH!

28:36.681 --> 28:38.316
- IT'S NO USE.

28:38.383 --> 28:39.651
WE'LL NEVER GET TURNER.

28:39.717 --> 28:41.453
EVEN FLIPSY'S LOST HOPE.

28:41.519 --> 28:42.954
- [whimpers]
- GOOD NEWS!

28:43.021 --> 28:44.823
I DROWNED THE SPIDER
IN A ROOT BEER FLOAT.

28:44.889 --> 28:46.558
LUCKILY, I GOT HIM
BEFORE HE BIT ME.

28:46.624 --> 28:49.861
- WAIT A MINUTE, I THINK I KNOW
SOMEONE WHO CAN HELP US.

28:49.928 --> 28:53.131
SOMEONE SO HIDEOUSLY EVIL,
SHE STRIKES FEAR

28:53.198 --> 28:55.266
IN THE HEARTS
OF EVERYONE SHE ENCOUNTERS.

28:55.333 --> 28:57.135
- IS SHE SINGLE?
- LEGEND HAS IT

28:57.202 --> 28:58.503
SHE'LL MAGICALLY APPEAR

28:58.570 --> 29:01.506
IF YOU MENTION HER NAME
IN A CHEAP DINER.

29:01.573 --> 29:02.907
VICKY.

29:04.309 --> 29:06.444
[all scream]

29:08.413 --> 29:11.015
- WHAT DO YOU LOSERS WANT?

29:11.082 --> 29:14.152
- WE WANT TIMMY TURNER'S HEAD
ON A PLATTER.

29:14.219 --> 29:15.687
- AND A MANGO ICED TEA.

29:15.753 --> 29:19.023
- SO YOU WANT TO DESTROY
THE TWERP AND YOU NEED MY HELP.

29:19.090 --> 29:22.026
- WAIT, WHY WOULD WE LISTEN
TO A MERE TEENAGE GIRL?

29:23.595 --> 29:25.563
- [growls]

29:27.165 --> 29:28.133
- [growls]

29:28.199 --> 29:30.668
- [whimpers]

29:30.735 --> 29:32.303
- YOU'RE HIRED.

29:32.370 --> 29:34.005
- YES, WE'LL GIVE YOU
A TEAM T-SHIRT

29:34.072 --> 29:36.875
AND YOUR STANDARD BABYSITTING
FEE OF $11.50 AN HOUR.

29:36.941 --> 29:38.076
- KEEP YOUR MONEY.

29:38.143 --> 29:39.744
I'LL HELP YOU
ANNIHILATE TIMMY

29:39.811 --> 29:41.479
FOR THE SHEER JOY OF IT.

29:41.546 --> 29:43.314
- OOH, I LIKE YOU.

29:43.381 --> 29:45.683
- NEVER LOOK IN THE EYES!

29:45.750 --> 29:48.153
- AAGH!
I'M BLIND.

29:48.219 --> 29:51.256
- TIME TO WHIP YOU WIMPS
INTO SHAPE.

29:51.322 --> 29:53.324
[all screaming]

29:53.391 --> 29:54.959
- [laughs wickedly]

29:56.594 --> 29:58.596
COME ON, YOU LOSERS.

29:58.663 --> 30:00.465
[all grunting]

30:00.532 --> 30:03.835
[all screaming]

30:03.902 --> 30:07.172
- THIS IS VERY EMBARRASSING.

30:08.540 --> 30:10.341
- [blows whistle]

30:10.408 --> 30:14.712
[all shouting]

30:14.779 --> 30:17.115
[all screaming]

30:17.182 --> 30:20.618
[laughs wickedly]

30:20.685 --> 30:23.188
CONGRATULATIONS, MAGGOTS.

30:23.254 --> 30:24.222
YOU'RE READY.

30:24.289 --> 30:25.223
- EXCELLENT.

30:25.290 --> 30:26.591
NOW WHAT'S THE PLAN?

30:26.658 --> 30:29.127
I KNOW. WE'LL BUY
A GIANT FLAT-SCREEN TV,

30:29.194 --> 30:31.329
THROW OUT THE TV, AND DISGUISE
THE BOX AS A VIDEO ARCADE

30:31.396 --> 30:33.097
TO LURE TURNER INSIDE.

30:33.164 --> 30:34.365
- THEN WE'LL TAPE THE BOX SHUT,

30:34.432 --> 30:36.201
DRAG IT TO THE BASE
OF MOUNT DIMMSDALE,

30:36.267 --> 30:37.468
AND START
AN AVALANCHE.

30:37.535 --> 30:39.537
- AND ONCE HE'S BURIED ALIVE,

30:39.604 --> 30:41.673
WE'LL DIG HIM UP
AND PUNCH HIM.

30:41.739 --> 30:43.374
- THAT'S JUST COMPLICATED.

30:43.441 --> 30:44.609
AND STUPID.

30:44.676 --> 30:46.110
IT'S FOUR AGAINST ONE.

30:46.177 --> 30:48.846
LET'S JUST STRAIGHT UP
DESTROY HIM.

30:48.913 --> 30:51.716
- OH, I REALLY LIKE HER.

30:51.783 --> 30:53.284
- OH, SHE'S A DELIGHT.

30:53.351 --> 30:55.320
- THE EYES!

30:55.386 --> 30:58.957
- ONLY HALF AN HOUR
TILL THE FAIRY-CLIPSE ENDS.

30:59.023 --> 31:01.626
- AND I CAN FINALLY POOF
THIS GROUNDHOG OFF MY LEG.

31:01.693 --> 31:04.128
I THINK
HE GAVE ME RABIES.

31:04.195 --> 31:05.163
- HALF AN HOUR.

31:05.230 --> 31:06.864
I'M GONNA MAKE IT.
- YEAH.

31:06.931 --> 31:09.334
THE ONLY WAY THOSE LOSERS
COULD POSSIBLY GET YOU NOW

31:09.400 --> 31:10.702
IS IF THEY TEAMED UP
WITH SOMEBODY

31:10.768 --> 31:12.103
EVEN MORE EVIL
THAN THEY ARE.

31:12.170 --> 31:14.339
BUT WHAT ARE THE ODDS OF THAT?

31:15.740 --> 31:17.208
- AAGH!
VICKY?

31:17.275 --> 31:19.244
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH THEM?

31:19.310 --> 31:20.612
- THEY BROUGHT ME IN

31:20.678 --> 31:22.113
TO TAKE YOU OUT.

31:22.180 --> 31:25.183
AND THAT'S
JUST WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO, TWERP.

31:25.250 --> 31:26.684
[laughs wickedly]

31:26.751 --> 31:28.453
- AAGH!

31:31.889 --> 31:33.591
YAAGH!

31:37.862 --> 31:38.896
- POOF-POOF!

31:38.963 --> 31:39.998
- YOU'RE RIGHT, POOF.

31:40.064 --> 31:41.733
WE HAVE TO SAVE TIMMY.

31:41.799 --> 31:44.202
- LOOK.
I CAN BLOW BUBBLES.

31:44.269 --> 31:45.670
OOH.

31:45.737 --> 31:48.573
ALSO MY KIDNEYS
ARE SHUTTING DOWN.

31:48.640 --> 31:50.174
- AAGH!
- YOU CAN RUN, TURNER,

31:50.241 --> 31:52.043
BUT YOU CAN'T HIDE.

31:52.110 --> 31:54.679
- [exclaims]

31:54.746 --> 31:57.548
- THIS IS FOR FLIPSY.

31:57.615 --> 31:59.917
- AAGH!

32:01.386 --> 32:03.621
AAGH!

32:05.223 --> 32:07.725
- [hollers]

32:07.792 --> 32:10.128
- WHAT HAVE I DONE?
- [groans]

32:10.194 --> 32:11.796
- [exclaims]

32:11.863 --> 32:13.064
POISON IVY!

32:13.131 --> 32:14.599
- AAGH!

32:14.666 --> 32:18.102
- I GIVE YOU AN "F"
FOR "FINISHED".

32:20.071 --> 32:22.206
OR MAYBE IT WAS TWO "F"S
FOR "FRIED FOOP".

32:22.273 --> 32:24.609
- AAGH!
GUYS!

32:24.676 --> 32:25.910
HOW DID YOU GET HERE?

32:25.977 --> 32:27.278
- WE TOOK THE BEAR BUS.

32:27.345 --> 32:28.746
- [growls]

32:28.813 --> 32:29.747
[bus horn honks]

32:29.814 --> 32:31.149
- I CAN'T RUN MUCH MORE.

32:31.215 --> 32:33.885
HOW LONG
TILL THE FAIRY-CLIPSE ENDS?

32:33.951 --> 32:35.853
- ONE MORE MINUTE, SPORT.

32:35.920 --> 32:38.323
- WE'RE COMING FOR YOU,
TWERP!

32:38.389 --> 32:39.457
- I HAVE A PLAN.

32:39.524 --> 32:41.092
THE SECOND
THE FAIRY-CLIPSE ENDS,

32:41.159 --> 32:42.660
HERE'S WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO.

32:42.727 --> 32:43.828
[whispers]

32:49.033 --> 32:51.336
[cheers]

32:51.402 --> 32:53.971
- NOW TO GRANT
TIMMY'S WISH.

32:57.375 --> 32:59.444
- [panting]

32:59.510 --> 33:02.046
[grunts]

33:02.113 --> 33:04.749
WAIT, VIOLENCE NEVER SOLVED
ANYTHING.

33:04.816 --> 33:07.185
CAN'T WE SETTLE THIS
WITH A GAME OF DODGE BALL?

33:07.251 --> 33:08.920
UGH.
OR MAYBE CHECKERS?

33:08.986 --> 33:10.555
UGH.
AH, COME ON.

33:10.621 --> 33:11.756
THAT'S NOT HOW YOU PLAY.

33:11.823 --> 33:15.059
NO!

33:18.496 --> 33:21.466
- [barks]
- HEH! I GOT YOU, TWERP.

33:21.532 --> 33:22.867
WAIT.
WHY DO I SOUND LIKE TIMMY?

33:25.937 --> 33:27.705
- HA, YOU GET AN "F", TURNER

33:27.772 --> 33:30.007
FOR "FEEL MY WRATH".

33:30.074 --> 33:31.509
AAGH, I THOUGHT
I DESTROYED YOU.

33:31.576 --> 33:33.010
- IN YOUR DREAMS, TURNER.

33:33.077 --> 33:35.546
IT IS I, FOOP,
WHO WILL DESTROY YOU.

33:35.613 --> 33:37.882
- THEN YOU GET AN "F"
FOR "FAT CHANCE"!

33:40.451 --> 33:42.720
- GUYS, WE DID IT!

33:42.787 --> 33:44.222
- POOF-POOF!

33:44.288 --> 33:46.124
- THAT WAS A GREAT IDEA,
SPORT.

33:46.190 --> 33:48.826
WISHING TO TURN YOUR ENEMIES
INTO TIMMY LOOKALIKES

33:48.893 --> 33:51.195
TRICKED THEM
INTO ANNIHILATING EACH OTHER.

33:51.262 --> 33:52.997
- OH, IS THAT
WHAT WE WERE DOING?

33:53.064 --> 33:54.832
I THOUGHT
WE WERE PLAYING CHECKERS.

33:54.899 --> 33:57.235
ALSO MY LUNGS ARE FILLED
WITH FLUID.

33:57.301 --> 33:59.470
- THANK GOODNESS
THE FAIRY-CLIPSE ENDED

33:59.537 --> 34:00.705
BEFORE THEY GOT YOU.

34:00.772 --> 34:01.973
- AND WE WON'T HAVE TO WORRY

34:02.039 --> 34:04.008
ABOUT ANOTHER ONE
FOR A MILLION YEARS.

34:04.075 --> 34:07.645
- WELL, THERE IS THE UPCOMING
AURORA FAIRY-ALIS

34:07.712 --> 34:10.782
WHEN THE EARTH'S MAGNETIC FIELDS
BLOCK THE BIG WANDS

34:10.848 --> 34:12.315
FOR 28 WEEKS.

34:12.382 --> 34:14.385
- AND THAT'S
WHY WE EAT SAUERKRAUT

34:14.452 --> 34:16.286
ON GERMAN UNIFICATION DAY.

34:16.353 --> 34:18.389
- HEY, COSMO'S RIGHT
THIS TIME.

34:18.456 --> 34:20.358
- YAY!

34:20.425 --> 34:23.360
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
WE BLEW IT AGAIN.

34:23.428 --> 34:24.728
YOU'RE FIRED, VICKY.

34:24.795 --> 34:28.699
- FINE. BUT I'M COMING BACK
WITH THE BEAR.

34:28.766 --> 34:30.067
- IF WE'RE GOING
TO DESTROY TURNER,

34:30.134 --> 34:31.536
WE'LL NEED A WAY
INTO HIS HOUSE.

34:31.601 --> 34:34.438
- I THINK THE NEW GUY
MAY BE ABLE TO HELP WITH THAT.

34:34.505 --> 34:35.672
[bell on door jingles]

34:35.739 --> 34:37.041
- HI, FELLAS!

34:37.108 --> 34:39.210
THANKS FOR LETTING ME JOIN
YOUR CLUB.

34:39.277 --> 34:41.212
WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU GUYS DO
ANYWAY?

34:41.279 --> 34:43.014
- JUST GIVE US YOUR HOUSE KEYS
AND WE'LL TELL YOU.

34:43.080 --> 34:45.850
- HEY, THERE'S A SPIDER
IN MY ROOT BEER FLOAT.

34:45.917 --> 34:47.485
AAGH!

34:47.552 --> 34:49.120
- MY EYES ARE NUMB.
