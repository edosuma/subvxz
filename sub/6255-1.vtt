00:00.352 --> 00:01.648
Previously on <i>Bones...</i>

00:01.649 --> 00:04.651
I want you to be my husband.
I want to...

00:04.686 --> 00:06.687
spend the rest of
my life with you.

00:06.721 --> 00:09.323
Will you marry me, Booth?
Yes.

00:09.357 --> 00:12.593
(chuckles)
Of course. Yes.

00:12.627 --> 00:13.760
(chuckles)

00:16.197 --> 00:18.498
SWEETS: <i>There's a hacker
named Christopher Pelant.</i>

00:18.533 --> 00:21.602
CAROLINE: <i>He's not a hacker anymore.
Now he's a murderer.</i>

00:21.636 --> 00:23.570
HODGINS:
<i>Eight people have been killed.</i>

00:23.605 --> 00:26.974
HODGINS: <i>We have to hit him back
now before one of us is dead.</i>

00:27.008 --> 00:29.409
PELANT: <i>You crossed a line
when you shot me, Agent Booth.</i>

00:29.444 --> 00:31.511
Do you think this is some kind of a game?
Of course.

00:31.546 --> 00:33.680
Now the rules have changed.
SWEETS: <i>The two of you getting engaged,</i>

00:33.715 --> 00:36.149
<i>with Pelant active,</i>
<i>he can't accept</i>

00:36.184 --> 00:38.118
<i>being replaced.</i>
<i>It could cause him to escalate.</i>

00:38.152 --> 00:40.921
BOOTH: Where are you? Pretty
much anywhere I want to be.

00:40.955 --> 00:42.823
Pelant can access
any security camera?

00:42.857 --> 00:44.458
PELANT: You won't marry
her, Agent Booth.

00:44.492 --> 00:46.059
And Dr. Brennan
can't know the reason

00:46.094 --> 00:47.294
why you're turning her down.

00:47.328 --> 00:49.162
If you tell her, I'll know.

00:49.197 --> 00:50.964
<i>If you ignore me, you'll</i>
<i>be responsible for the deaths</i>

00:50.999 --> 00:52.499
of five innocent people.

00:52.533 --> 00:53.834
We need to talk.

00:53.868 --> 00:55.369
About us
getting married.

00:55.403 --> 00:56.603
I don't think we should do it.

01:02.543 --> 01:05.012
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

01:05.046 --> 01:07.414
(sighs, mutters)
It's been, uh...

01:07.448 --> 01:09.650
(hisses)
Mmm.

01:09.684 --> 01:11.918
Whoa.

01:11.953 --> 01:13.553
This is definitely not
the good stuff, Father.

01:13.588 --> 01:15.149
Don't call me "Father,"
Master Sergeant.

01:15.156 --> 01:16.657
I'm not a priest anymore.

01:16.691 --> 01:19.092
I'm not in the Army anymore,
so that makes us even.

01:19.127 --> 01:20.961
How long has it been
since my last confession?

01:20.995 --> 01:23.530
Eight years.
Eight years.

01:23.564 --> 01:25.332
It's been eight years.
You sure it's been eight years?

01:25.366 --> 01:27.634
You were my last confession.

01:27.669 --> 01:30.504
It's the kind of milestone
a priest remembers.

01:30.538 --> 01:32.539
How's about you tell me
what's on your mind

01:32.573 --> 01:34.975
and leave God out of it?

01:36.844 --> 01:41.114
I lied to the woman I love.

01:41.149 --> 01:43.717
That's not a quick lie
from the brain.

01:43.751 --> 01:45.519
That's a whopper from the heart.

01:45.553 --> 01:49.222
Right. Which makes it a sin.

01:49.257 --> 01:51.825
No. You want my advice,

01:51.859 --> 01:55.662
you get your ass home
and tell Temperance the truth.

01:56.631 --> 01:58.799
You have somewhere we can talk?

01:58.833 --> 02:01.001
No, I mean
a place where...

02:01.035 --> 02:04.404
there's no TVs or radios
or anything that transmits

02:04.439 --> 02:06.873
or receives or glows.
(chuckling)

02:06.908 --> 02:10.077
Man, you are
tin-foil-hat paranoid.

02:15.149 --> 02:18.185
This guy killed
how many people?

02:18.219 --> 02:20.153
Eight.

02:20.188 --> 02:22.389
In my opinion, it's just
the tip of the iceberg.

02:22.423 --> 02:23.957
And he told you

02:23.991 --> 02:26.293
that if you married Temperance
that he would choose

02:26.327 --> 02:28.862
five random human beings
and kill them?

02:28.896 --> 02:30.497
Not only if I married Bones
but, you know,

02:30.531 --> 02:32.232
if I told her why
we couldn't get married.

02:32.266 --> 02:34.534
You believe he'd do it? This
guy is worse than anyone

02:34.569 --> 02:36.970
you and I have ever come across.

02:37.004 --> 02:38.872
So you and Temperance go
on a camping trip,

02:38.906 --> 02:41.842
you get lost in a cave and you
whisper the truth in her ear.

02:41.876 --> 02:44.010
"I love you.
I want to marry you,

02:44.045 --> 02:46.279
but I can't because Plant
will kill innocent people."

02:46.314 --> 02:48.248
Pelant, okay? And she would
come out of that cave

02:48.282 --> 02:49.716
and she would look all happy.

02:49.751 --> 02:51.885
No poker face, huh?
None whatsoever.

02:51.919 --> 02:53.086
You know what, I'm just
gonna have to kill him.

02:53.121 --> 02:54.955
Whoa, n...
What? Why not?

02:54.989 --> 02:57.124
Either that or I'm just gonna
have to find him and then...

02:57.158 --> 02:58.692
and tell her why I did
what I did.

02:58.726 --> 03:00.961
So how long will it take
to catch him?

03:00.995 --> 03:02.896
I've been looking
for this guy for three months

03:02.930 --> 03:04.664
and I got nothing.
It's a complete dead end.

03:04.699 --> 03:06.666
This is what he
wants, right?

03:06.701 --> 03:09.102
To drive a wedge between
the two of you? Yeah.

03:09.137 --> 03:11.371
That's what he wants.

03:11.405 --> 03:14.074
And he's doing
a pretty good job of it, too.

03:14.108 --> 03:16.810
Well, then you'd better find him
and kill him.

What are you doing
here in my office?

03:29.357 --> 03:30.791
Why didn't you answer
your phone?

03:30.825 --> 03:32.325
Why do you smell like bourbon?

03:32.360 --> 03:34.394
'Cause I was talking to a
priest, Mom, Dad, right?

03:34.428 --> 03:35.996
Okay, what is this, huh?

03:36.030 --> 03:38.031
'Cause I got no problems
here at work.

03:38.065 --> 03:40.267
We're not here about work.
Then it's none of your business.

03:40.301 --> 03:42.135
All I know, we used to be happy.

03:42.170 --> 03:43.737
Then Dr. Brennan
proposed to you

03:43.771 --> 03:45.705
Which is what you wanted.
...and you say yes,

03:45.740 --> 03:48.008
then you say no and
everybody's miserable.

03:48.042 --> 03:50.710
How is that not our business?
It's totally our business.

03:50.745 --> 03:53.480
It's between me and Bones.
(phone beeps)

03:53.514 --> 03:55.315
Oh, look at that.

03:55.349 --> 03:57.350
Dead body
at the Lightfoot Hotel.

03:57.385 --> 03:59.786
Hmm. Crime scene time.
(clicks tongue)

03:59.821 --> 04:02.522
Have you noticed that
dead bodies always save Booth

04:02.557 --> 04:04.090
from confronting his demons?

04:04.125 --> 04:07.027
Maybe that's why he smells
like bourbon!

04:08.262 --> 04:10.163
SAROYAN:
Oh, God, that's awful.

04:10.198 --> 04:12.732
BRENNAN: Yes, it's going
to be a lot of work to get

04:12.767 --> 04:13.790
all the remains out of there.

04:13.815 --> 04:15.605
I meant what happened
to the person.

04:15.606 --> 04:18.071
BOOTH: So what
do you figure, huh?

04:18.072 --> 04:20.841
Suicide from the roof?
Hi, Bones.

04:20.875 --> 04:23.276
I called you earlier.
Yeah, you know,

04:23.311 --> 04:25.478
I forgot to charge my phone.

04:26.647 --> 04:29.983
Christine wanted
to talk to her daddy.

04:34.722 --> 04:37.457
SAROYAN: There's a
relatively large piece.

04:39.861 --> 04:41.995
BRENNAN: Looks like
it was thrown clear

04:42.029 --> 04:45.298
by the centrifugal force
of the whirling fan.

04:45.333 --> 04:47.534
<i>Supraspinous fossa,</i>

04:47.568 --> 04:49.102
right proximal humerus.

04:49.136 --> 04:51.304
Shoulder. The body was dragged

04:51.339 --> 04:53.273
some distance after death.

04:53.307 --> 04:54.374
There's evidence
of subluxation.

04:54.408 --> 04:55.408
BOOTH:
Great. Okay.

04:55.443 --> 04:56.943
He was murdered, dragged

04:56.978 --> 04:58.678
and thrown off a roof.

05:04.585 --> 05:08.088
(quietly): Okay, I don't usually
get involved, Seeley, but...

05:08.122 --> 05:10.190
you got cold feet,
I understand that.

05:10.224 --> 05:12.859
However, if you don't warm
up those feet real fast,

05:12.894 --> 05:14.895
you're gonna lose
her forever.

05:14.929 --> 05:17.097

<i>Special Agent Booth,</i>

06:03.093 --> 06:04.694
this is the hotel manager,

06:04.728 --> 06:06.496
Mr. Gough. The air
conditioner turned on

06:06.530 --> 06:08.931
automatically at 8:00
this morning.

06:08.966 --> 06:10.933
It didn't work because of...
Well, we know

06:10.968 --> 06:12.869
why it wasn't working. Am I
to understand that you are

06:12.903 --> 06:15.271
taking our entire
air-conditioning unit?

06:15.305 --> 06:17.640
Well, the whole
inside is splattered

06:17.674 --> 06:19.642
with human remains.
It's no use to you.

06:19.676 --> 06:21.711
We're also gonna need
all the security footage

06:21.745 --> 06:23.813
from your security cameras.

06:23.847 --> 06:26.015
The Lightfoot doesn't utilize
cameras, Agent Booth. Oh.

06:26.049 --> 06:27.884
What? Why not?
It's the type

06:27.918 --> 06:30.253
of hotel where you bring ladies
who aren't your wife.

06:30.287 --> 06:33.322
Isn't that right, Mr. Gough? We're
renowned for our discretion.

06:33.357 --> 06:35.358
Well, we're gonna do
a room-to-room check.

06:35.392 --> 06:37.126
Or maybe you'd like
to help us figure out

06:37.161 --> 06:40.696
which room the
victim jumped from?

06:40.731 --> 06:43.699
We did have one guest who was
supposed to check out today

06:43.734 --> 06:45.067
who has not.

06:52.176 --> 06:55.178
The air-conditioning unit is
on its way back to the lab.

06:55.212 --> 06:56.579
Do you need me for anything?

06:56.613 --> 06:58.614
The room was registered
under a fake name,

06:58.649 --> 07:00.283
paid in cash.

07:01.752 --> 07:05.021
Yep, directly over the
air-conditioning unit. Mmm.

07:05.956 --> 07:07.256
Looks like housekeeping

07:07.291 --> 07:08.658
already cleaned
the room.

07:08.692 --> 07:10.259
They haven't been here yet.

07:10.294 --> 07:12.395
Somebody else cleaned it.

07:12.429 --> 07:15.064
Well, the forensic team
can sweep it

07:15.098 --> 07:18.234
for DNA and
fingerprints.

07:18.268 --> 07:20.136
I need to get back to the lab.

07:20.170 --> 07:21.871
Oh.
(sniffs)

07:21.905 --> 07:23.773
What?
I smell...

07:23.807 --> 07:27.376
vodka.
Vodka. Right.

07:27.411 --> 07:29.045
Listen, Bones, um,

07:29.079 --> 07:31.581
a-about not answering
the phone earlier...

07:31.615 --> 07:32.882
I know you were lying.

07:32.916 --> 07:35.017
And you didn't come home
last night.

07:35.052 --> 07:39.188
I was working. I have my regular hours,
plus I'm trying to catch Pelant.

07:39.223 --> 07:42.391
Angela agrees. She says
you're lying, too. Angela?

07:42.426 --> 07:45.795
Well, you know,
Angela doesn't know everything.

07:49.199 --> 07:51.767
I'd die for you.

07:54.605 --> 07:57.173
I love you.

08:00.978 --> 08:02.011
Blood.

08:02.045 --> 08:04.013
Blood.

08:06.149 --> 08:08.484
These smears

08:08.518 --> 08:11.554
indicate that a blood
spray pattern

08:11.588 --> 08:13.689
was wiped up.
BOOTH: It was cleaned up

08:13.724 --> 08:16.425
by the vodka. Meaning the
murder wasn't planned.

08:16.460 --> 08:19.428
Crime of passion.

08:22.165 --> 08:25.001
This is gonna take forever.

08:25.035 --> 08:26.636
This fan weighs 1,200 pounds.

08:26.670 --> 08:28.204
There are five blades,

08:28.238 --> 08:30.973
spinning at 2,700
revolutions per minute.

08:31.008 --> 08:33.442
It's the world's biggest
body blender.

08:33.477 --> 08:34.777
I'm gonna cancel
every social occasion

08:34.811 --> 08:36.345
I have in the
next three days,

08:36.380 --> 08:38.214
including a date
with a fireman.

08:38.248 --> 08:40.182
That's dedication.

08:40.217 --> 08:41.817
More metallic fragments.
What's that?

08:41.852 --> 08:43.753
His fillings? Well,
I've been finding

08:43.787 --> 08:45.821
what I think
are parts of a cell phone,

08:45.856 --> 08:48.457
but it's pretty smashed up.

08:48.492 --> 08:50.459
Huh. I'm guessing

08:50.494 --> 08:54.030
that this is part
of a wristwatch, but...

08:54.064 --> 08:56.399
I haven't been able
to find any other parts.

08:58.302 --> 09:00.202
It's a stapes.

09:00.237 --> 09:03.506
The small bone from the ear?
This is definitely not made of bone.

09:03.540 --> 09:05.675
It's an artificial stapes
made out of titanium.

09:05.709 --> 09:07.576
It's used
in the treatment

09:07.611 --> 09:09.779
of otosclerosis.
There should be a...

09:09.813 --> 09:12.048
Serial number.
DAISY: That'll give us identification

09:12.082 --> 09:14.517
much more readily than a piece
of a wristwatch.

09:14.551 --> 09:16.052
Oh, rub it in, Daisy.

09:16.086 --> 09:18.688
Yeah, rub it in.

09:18.722 --> 09:23.659
BRENNAN: <i>Angela I.D.'d the
victim as Jonas Siedel.</i>

09:23.694 --> 09:25.895
I always think
it's interesting to consider

09:25.929 --> 09:28.798
that a murder victim
leaves his home...

09:28.832 --> 09:30.766
thinking he'll be back.

09:30.801 --> 09:32.968
Then he isn't.

09:33.003 --> 09:35.538
Right.
So, anything else

09:35.572 --> 09:37.673
about the victim
jump out at you, Bones?

09:37.708 --> 09:41.010
Maybe you should bring
Sweets here to...

09:41.044 --> 09:44.480
analyze the environment
for psychological insights.

09:44.514 --> 09:46.549
Wait, you don't believe
in psychological insights.

09:46.583 --> 09:47.950
But you do.

09:47.984 --> 09:51.554
We have many, many differences.

09:53.557 --> 09:55.257
Look, um, the victim

09:55.292 --> 09:57.059
was some kind of an accountant
at the State Department.

09:57.094 --> 09:59.462
I'm gonna go check him out.
Do you want to come with me?

09:59.496 --> 10:01.197
I better get back to the lab.

10:01.231 --> 10:02.898
I do my best work there.

10:02.933 --> 10:04.300
Take Sweets.

10:04.334 --> 10:05.868
Sweets again.

10:05.902 --> 10:09.105
I think it would be a better use
of all of our time.

10:13.043 --> 10:14.610
SWEETS:
<i>So, the victim</i>

10:14.644 --> 10:16.812
was unmarried.
So?

10:16.847 --> 10:18.948
Single and an accountant
for the State Department?

10:18.982 --> 10:20.649
Oh, Sweets, people
do have secret lives.

10:20.684 --> 10:24.820
All right? Doesn't matter
what you do for a living.

10:24.855 --> 10:26.255
Mr. Norman can see you now.

10:27.557 --> 10:29.792
NORMAN:
<i>I can't believe he's dead.</i>

10:29.826 --> 10:33.362
Jonas did cost-benefit analysis
on various nontraditional

10:33.397 --> 10:34.964
public transportation models
in Europe.

10:34.998 --> 10:36.332
What, with bicycles?

10:36.366 --> 10:38.334
Well, none of us
drive cars here.

10:38.368 --> 10:39.935
It's public transportation,
bicycles

10:39.970 --> 10:41.670
or walking all the way.

10:41.705 --> 10:43.973
(phone rings)
Booth.

10:44.007 --> 10:45.808
MONTENEGRO:
Don't hang up. It's me.

10:45.842 --> 10:47.476
Why would I hang up on you?

10:47.511 --> 10:48.711
Because we don't like each other

10:48.745 --> 10:50.146
ever since you broke
Brennan's heart.

10:50.180 --> 10:51.380
I'd hang up on you.

10:51.415 --> 10:52.915
Let's move on.

10:52.949 --> 10:54.250
Jonas Siedel's
cell phone records

10:54.284 --> 10:55.785
show that somebody texted him

10:55.819 --> 10:58.487
22 times the day
before he was murdered.

10:58.522 --> 11:00.289
Who was it?
The number is registered

11:00.323 --> 11:01.924
to the Transportation
Accountancy Office

11:01.958 --> 11:03.359
at the State Department.

11:03.393 --> 11:04.894
That's exactly
where we are right now.

11:04.928 --> 11:06.095
Yeah. That's why I called.

11:06.129 --> 11:08.631
No name?
Nope. Company-issue phone.

11:08.665 --> 11:10.800
All right, just call now.

11:10.834 --> 11:13.602
Can you think of any reason
why Jonas Siedel

11:13.637 --> 11:16.172
would check into a hotel
under an assumed name?

11:16.206 --> 11:17.807
Jonas wasn't
a big one

11:17.841 --> 11:20.075
for talking about his past,
that's for sure.

11:20.110 --> 11:23.479
Agent Booth, it's for you--
someone named Angela.

11:23.513 --> 11:25.614
I don't know how
she got my number, but...

11:25.649 --> 11:27.616
she says it's important.
Actually it is very important.

11:27.651 --> 11:28.811
I'm gonna have to take you
in for questioning.

11:28.836 --> 11:29.552
NORMAN: What?

11:29.553 --> 11:31.487
Why?
It's all right, Mr. Norman.

11:31.521 --> 11:32.888
Lily, do not
say anything

11:32.923 --> 11:34.323
until I find you a lawyer.

11:34.357 --> 11:36.025
I have a lawyer, Mr. Norman;
don't worry.

11:36.059 --> 11:37.326
Everything's
gonna be okay.

11:37.360 --> 11:38.794
You guys are making
a terrible mistake.

11:38.829 --> 11:40.162
We hear that a lot.

11:40.197 --> 11:42.498
Let's go.
NORMAN: Wait. Wait. (sighs)

11:43.911 --> 11:45.494
Look. Is this your phone?

11:45.495 --> 11:48.197
My client has already stated
that the phone

11:48.231 --> 11:50.800
belongs to her employer.
But it was assigned to you?

11:50.834 --> 11:52.435
Agent Booth, you've asked
my daughter eight questions.

11:52.469 --> 11:54.603
I've advised her
not to answer any of them.

11:54.638 --> 11:55.838
What does that tell you?

11:55.872 --> 11:57.392
That your daughter
is hiding something.

11:57.407 --> 11:59.141
MOTHER: Everyone has
something to hide,

11:59.176 --> 12:00.943
which is why
we invented lawyers.

12:00.977 --> 12:02.211
My briefcase cost me

12:02.245 --> 12:04.146
$5,000--
what does that tell you?

12:04.181 --> 12:06.315
That you're bad with your money.
I'm a very good lawyer,

12:06.349 --> 12:08.350
so you might as well just
cut my daughter loose right now.

12:08.385 --> 12:11.554
Did you text-message Jonas
Siedel the day that he died?

12:11.588 --> 12:13.723
Do not answer that, Lily.
Look, there's got to be

12:13.757 --> 12:15.424
some kind of conflict
of interest here.

12:15.459 --> 12:17.560
You know? A mother being
the daughter's lawyer?

12:17.594 --> 12:19.695
There's no conflict of interest.

12:19.730 --> 12:24.266
But on the upside, you got
one of your questions answered.

12:25.168 --> 12:26.936
Thanks for coming in.

12:26.970 --> 12:28.537
Mm-hmm.

12:32.509 --> 12:34.410
Except one last thing.

12:34.444 --> 12:36.712
Tenacious or what?
This many text messages,

12:36.747 --> 12:40.116
combined with a fake name
and a hotel room.

12:40.150 --> 12:42.551
MOTHER: Even if Lily did
exchange texts with the victim,

12:42.586 --> 12:44.653
which she has not admitted,
it does not mean sex.

12:44.688 --> 12:46.222
That is definitely
a lawyer speaking,

12:46.256 --> 12:47.990
because as a mother,
you've got to know better.

12:48.024 --> 12:49.959
Look, you have to help me
out here, all right?

12:49.993 --> 12:51.961
Did Jonas Siedel deserve
to be murdered

12:51.995 --> 12:53.562
and tossed out that window?

12:53.597 --> 12:55.397
Not a word, Lily.
Not a damn word.

12:55.432 --> 12:56.766
Jonas did not
deserve to die.

12:56.800 --> 12:58.968
I had no sexual
relationship with him,

12:59.002 --> 13:00.936
and I didn't kill him.

13:00.971 --> 13:03.005
I hope you find who did.

13:03.039 --> 13:05.474
MOTHER: "Not a word" doesn't mean
answer three questions, Lily.

13:05.509 --> 13:08.511
Tenacious, very tenacious.

13:08.545 --> 13:10.579
I mean that as a compliment.

13:14.551 --> 13:16.218
Removing all of
the body parts

13:16.253 --> 13:19.255
from the fan and the housing
is taking too long.

13:19.289 --> 13:21.757
(phone rings) Unfortunately,
we can't just hose it out.

13:21.792 --> 13:22.958
Oh.

13:24.394 --> 13:26.529
Is everything
all right?

13:26.563 --> 13:28.097
BRENNAN:
Uh, Booth wants to get

13:28.131 --> 13:30.633
a late lunch,
but I don't think I have time.

13:30.667 --> 13:31.934
Go.
Go.

13:31.968 --> 13:33.869
Yeah, have lunch.

13:35.806 --> 13:37.773
(sighing):
Okay.

13:37.808 --> 13:39.141
Thanks. I-I won't take long.

13:39.176 --> 13:41.310
I find I have
no real appetite these days.

13:41.344 --> 13:43.779
Do you think she was
speaking sexually?

13:43.814 --> 13:46.549
Daisy! Well, 'cause I can
get her a date in a snap.

13:46.583 --> 13:49.151
I'm seeing a fireman,
and he has friends.

13:49.186 --> 13:50.319
Daisy!

13:59.296 --> 14:01.630
So, how's everything
at the lab?

14:03.333 --> 14:05.201
We're at an impasse,
until we get

14:05.235 --> 14:08.070
all the human remains
out of the air conditioner.

14:08.104 --> 14:10.339
And reassemble the skeleton.

14:13.777 --> 14:15.845
We could talk
about Christine.

14:15.879 --> 14:18.581
Christine is doing
very well.

14:18.615 --> 14:21.650
She recognizes all
of her colors, and...

14:21.685 --> 14:24.687
I think she's following along
when I read to her.

14:24.721 --> 14:26.789
Or when I read to her, too.

14:26.823 --> 14:29.024
You're talking as if...

14:29.059 --> 14:30.359
I'm not even there.

14:30.393 --> 14:32.728
It feels like you aren't there.

14:32.762 --> 14:36.232
Which I realize is a kind
of illusion, but that's...

14:36.266 --> 14:38.367
that's how it feels.

14:46.910 --> 14:48.577
You know...
(clears throat)

14:48.612 --> 14:51.080
like you suggested,
Sweets and I are gonna go

14:51.114 --> 14:54.183
check out the
victim's apartment.

14:56.686 --> 14:59.355
How was the interrogation?
Not good.

14:59.389 --> 15:02.858
The, uh, girl's mother turned
out to be a big-deal...

15:02.893 --> 15:05.294
criminal defense
lawyer, and...

15:05.328 --> 15:07.396
she won't let her talk.

15:07.430 --> 15:09.598
Protecting her child.

15:09.633 --> 15:11.033
(chuckles softly)

15:11.067 --> 15:13.235
But I think she wants
to tell me the truth.

15:13.270 --> 15:15.604
The truth is best.

15:15.639 --> 15:18.641
You taught me that.

15:19.943 --> 15:21.377
Look, we're gonna...

15:21.411 --> 15:23.646
get past all of this.
I-I don't even know

15:23.680 --> 15:25.714
what "all of this" is.
(silverware clatters)

15:25.749 --> 15:27.616
Hey.

15:27.651 --> 15:29.385
Hey, look...

15:29.419 --> 15:31.620
I love you, okay?
You love me.

15:31.655 --> 15:34.089
Everything's gonna be okay.

15:34.124 --> 15:37.760
I know you want me to accept
what you're saying on faith--

15:37.794 --> 15:40.362
because you're a man of faith--
but I believe in patterns

15:40.397 --> 15:42.264
and sequences, and...

15:42.299 --> 15:43.899
this sequence doesn't end well

15:43.934 --> 15:46.669
unless something
disrupts the pattern.

16:07.524 --> 16:10.492
It is not merely a case
of rewiring the capacitors,

16:10.527 --> 16:12.461
even though
they are nonpolarized,

16:12.495 --> 16:16.231
but flywheel and drive shafts
are also affected,

16:16.266 --> 16:18.600
not to mention
the complex wiring

16:18.635 --> 16:19.768
regarding the
thermostat.

16:19.803 --> 16:21.770
This is not what I expected.

16:21.805 --> 16:23.405
What did you expect?
Well, I thought

16:23.440 --> 16:25.708
maybe you'd turn it upside down
and shake it.

16:25.742 --> 16:27.776
It weighs six tons.

16:28.712 --> 16:31.013
Oh, joking, yes.

16:31.047 --> 16:34.116
All right,
let's give it a go.

16:34.150 --> 16:36.285
Give what a go?
I'm gonna turn it on again.

16:36.319 --> 16:38.187
What? Wait. Wait.

16:39.089 --> 16:42.291
(whooshing, splattering)

16:44.060 --> 16:45.027
(flips switch)

16:45.061 --> 16:47.029
(whooshing dies down)

16:48.064 --> 16:50.499
Did you not
hear me say wait?

16:51.334 --> 16:52.801
(mechanical creaking)

16:57.640 --> 16:59.675
Wow. Okay, this place
is completely different

16:59.709 --> 17:01.977
from when me and Bones
checked it out.

17:02.012 --> 17:03.912
Wow. It's, like,
no photos, no...

17:03.947 --> 17:05.781
artwork or
collectibles.

17:05.815 --> 17:07.715
This furniture's
obviously rented.

17:07.751 --> 17:09.651
Sweets, everything is gone.

17:09.685 --> 17:11.185
Nothing's here;
everything was taken out.

17:11.221 --> 17:13.321
Maybe the condo people
moved it into storage.

17:13.356 --> 17:14.923
This computer
might tell us something.

17:14.958 --> 17:16.724
Yeah, I was hoping
you'd be able

17:16.760 --> 17:18.861
to give me some insight
into how this guy ticks.

17:18.895 --> 17:20.229
Books are gone.

17:20.262 --> 17:22.231
I think there was
a kayak over here.

17:22.265 --> 17:23.898
(thump, crashing)

17:24.934 --> 17:26.435
Booth!
The window!

17:26.469 --> 17:27.836
(groans)

17:27.871 --> 17:29.004
How many?

17:35.945 --> 17:38.347
(groans)

17:57.634 --> 18:00.769
♪

18:26.596 --> 18:29.231
♪

18:58.528 --> 19:01.263
♪

19:07.670 --> 19:09.605
Freeze. FBI.

19:09.639 --> 19:10.873
Ooh, FBI. I'm shaking.

19:10.907 --> 19:12.641
Danny? You look
like hell, Booth.

19:12.675 --> 19:14.576
You need to eat vegetables,
get some sleep.

19:14.611 --> 19:15.641
So what are we gonna do, we gonna
just shoot each other?

19:15.666 --> 19:17.146
Not here.

19:17.147 --> 19:18.680
Bad grade school memories.

19:18.715 --> 19:20.282
All right.

19:20.316 --> 19:22.217
So I guess you're
not gonna tell me

19:22.252 --> 19:23.785
what you were doing
in that apartment, huh?

19:23.820 --> 19:25.621
I was there
doing what I do.

19:25.655 --> 19:28.023
That sort of tells you
everything you need to know.

19:28.925 --> 19:30.325
Ha-ha. Okay.

19:30.360 --> 19:31.793
See you, Danny.

19:31.828 --> 19:34.029
SWEETS (panting):
Booth! Booth!

19:34.063 --> 19:36.098
He's getting away.

19:36.132 --> 19:37.733
He's...
Yep.

19:37.767 --> 19:39.034
He's getting away.

19:39.068 --> 19:40.903
He's getting away.
Looks that way.

19:40.937 --> 19:42.971
Who is that guy?

19:43.006 --> 19:45.040
That was Danny Beck.

19:45.074 --> 19:46.742
Old Army buddy.

19:46.776 --> 19:48.810
He's CIA.

19:51.246 --> 19:54.015
BOOTH:
<i>So, Jonas Siedel was CIA.</i>

19:54.049 --> 19:55.950
That introduces
a lot of suspects.

19:55.984 --> 19:59.286
Yeah, including Iran and
North Korea, and everyone else

19:59.321 --> 20:01.889
in the world that's mad at us.
So this whole

20:01.923 --> 20:04.258
accountant-studying-
European-transportation thing

20:04.292 --> 20:06.560
was a cover?
Look, Danny was just making sure that

20:06.595 --> 20:08.425
the apartment was sanitized;
that's what he does.

20:08.450 --> 20:09.230
SWEETS: Oh.

20:09.231 --> 20:11.132
Okay, so it's not
in any way my fault

20:11.166 --> 20:13.167
that I couldn't get anything
off the apartment, then.

20:13.201 --> 20:14.201
Interesting.

20:14.236 --> 20:16.237
Why?
Danny has nothing

20:16.271 --> 20:17.805
against us solving
Siedel's murder.

20:17.839 --> 20:20.474
He's just not gonna help.
Look, the CIA's

20:20.509 --> 20:23.144
gonna work it from their side,
we'll work it from our side.

20:27.949 --> 20:30.551
We are at war
with the CIA?

20:30.585 --> 20:32.119
That's a little melodramatic.

20:32.154 --> 20:34.922
Hey, they have killer
robot drones, Cam.

20:34.956 --> 20:36.957
Read a newspaper.

20:36.992 --> 20:39.827
You seem very interested
in this Band-Aid.

20:39.861 --> 20:42.430
Leave no stone unturned,
Dr. Hodgins.

20:42.464 --> 20:43.798
I'll check out
the wound,

20:43.832 --> 20:45.599
you'll run tests
on the Band-Aid.

20:45.634 --> 20:47.635
So we're really desperate
on this one, huh? (sighs)

20:47.669 --> 20:49.970
Going down for the third time.
Hey.

20:50.005 --> 20:52.740
How much would you give me
if it's a small puncture wound

20:52.774 --> 20:55.843
of the sort that would be
delivered by a hypodermic needle

20:55.877 --> 20:57.745
full of untraceable
CIA poison?

20:57.779 --> 21:00.981
Let's pursue a few
less exotic options first, okay?

21:01.016 --> 21:02.616
HODGINS (sighs):
Yeah.

21:02.651 --> 21:04.185
Sure.

21:04.219 --> 21:06.020
Just a minor abrasion.

21:06.054 --> 21:08.122
So, this is
our cause of death.

21:08.156 --> 21:10.725
A boo-boo.

21:12.027 --> 21:14.128
Every single hard drive,
memory card

21:14.162 --> 21:17.431
and piece of memory
has been removed, erased.

21:17.466 --> 21:18.999
Look, just do the best
that you can.

21:19.034 --> 21:20.401
Booth, without memory,

21:20.435 --> 21:21.635
computers are just toasters.

21:21.670 --> 21:22.903
There's no information.

21:22.938 --> 21:24.805
Well, crumbs
in a toaster can tell you

21:24.840 --> 21:26.807
what someone had
for breakfast, huh?

21:26.842 --> 21:28.242
Well, a bagel?

21:28.276 --> 21:29.677
Raisin toast? A crumpet?

21:29.711 --> 21:31.178
You want me to look
for crumpet crumbs?

21:31.213 --> 21:32.613
Is there anything else?

21:32.647 --> 21:34.348
Yeah, there is something else.

21:34.382 --> 21:36.717
Stop telling Bones
I'm lying to her.

21:36.752 --> 21:38.285
What's the problem, Booth?

21:38.320 --> 21:40.921
What, do you need one more fling
before settling down?

21:40.956 --> 21:44.158
I'm not a fling kind of a guy,
and you know that.

21:44.192 --> 21:45.760
Maybe Brennan isn't
as attractive to you

21:45.794 --> 21:47.094
now that she's become a mom.

21:47.129 --> 21:49.463
You're not helping
the situation.

21:49.498 --> 21:50.698
You're ruining
her very fragile heart.

21:50.732 --> 21:52.233
You should be ashamed
of yourself!

22:02.844 --> 22:04.745
Seeley, I got customers
out there.

22:04.780 --> 22:06.647
In three minutes, they're gonna
start serving themselves.

22:06.681 --> 22:08.182
Look, I just have a
fast question, Father.

22:08.216 --> 22:09.950
Aldo. Aldo, right. Look,
I would sacrifice

22:09.985 --> 22:12.052
my own life for Bones,
all right? I would kill for her.

22:12.087 --> 22:14.588
Then why am I not calling
Pelant's bluff, huh?

22:14.623 --> 22:17.424
I mean, it's not my fault
I put first the happiness

22:17.459 --> 22:19.126
of the woman I love.
That's true.

22:19.161 --> 22:20.761
It's true, right?
One question.

22:20.796 --> 22:22.797
When Temperance finds out
that you put her happiness

22:22.831 --> 22:24.665
ahead of the lives
of five innocent people,

22:24.699 --> 22:26.333
how will she react?

22:26.368 --> 22:28.302
You knew the answer already.

22:28.336 --> 22:29.657
You just needed
to hear me say it.

22:29.671 --> 22:31.539
Hey, do me a favor.

22:31.573 --> 22:34.909
Pass these around to a couple
of your hard-drinking FBI pals

22:34.943 --> 22:37.344
and don't tell any of them
that I used to be a priest.

22:37.379 --> 22:38.746
MAN:
Hey, Aldo!

22:38.780 --> 22:40.548
Right.

22:41.783 --> 22:43.617
DAISY: The challenge
now is to figure out

22:43.652 --> 22:46.086
which of these injuries occurred
before death,

22:46.121 --> 22:47.922
which caused death,

22:47.956 --> 22:50.891
and which were caused after the
body fell through a rusty grate

22:50.926 --> 22:52.626
into a giant spinning propeller.

22:52.661 --> 22:55.863
There's a diffuse pattern
of remodeled injuries

22:55.897 --> 22:57.731
that occurred
at the same time

22:57.766 --> 22:59.600
approximately
six years ago.

22:59.634 --> 23:01.635
I thought maybe it
was a car accident,

23:01.670 --> 23:04.038
but the fracturing
appears random

23:04.072 --> 23:06.173
and spread over
the entire body.

23:06.208 --> 23:08.008
It's a bomb, Daisy.

23:08.043 --> 23:09.944
But there's no
sign of shrapnel.

23:09.978 --> 23:11.545
But these butterfly fractures

23:11.580 --> 23:14.048
on the visceral surface
of the ribs resulted

23:14.082 --> 23:15.983
from a bending force.

23:16.017 --> 23:17.751
A shockwave.

23:17.786 --> 23:20.888
That's why he had
a prosthetic stapes.

23:20.922 --> 23:22.356
The blast deafened him.

23:22.390 --> 23:23.924
Wow.

23:23.959 --> 23:26.861
Being a CIA operative
is a very tough gig.

23:26.895 --> 23:28.896
(sighs)

23:28.930 --> 23:31.098
It's really
getting late.

23:31.132 --> 23:33.901
Ooh, I hope we got
<i>Sleepy Hollow</i> on the DVR.

23:33.935 --> 23:36.737
(sighs)
Booth is punishing me.

23:36.771 --> 23:39.106
I know that you think
that I should stay out of it,

23:39.140 --> 23:41.575
but detachment isn't
really my thing.

23:41.610 --> 23:44.178
What's with the printer?
I know what you did there.

23:44.212 --> 23:46.547
You detached. I am
telling you, Angie,

23:46.581 --> 23:49.483
there is something going on with
Booth that we don't know about.

23:49.517 --> 23:51.151
So, what is with the printer?

23:51.186 --> 23:53.721
Well, the CIA removed
all the memory,

23:53.755 --> 23:55.289
but what if I could

23:55.323 --> 23:58.726
re-create the final image
that the printer printed?

23:58.760 --> 24:00.394
Ghosting. Oh, that is awesome.

24:00.428 --> 24:02.196
Hey, can I make a suggestion?

24:02.230 --> 24:04.365
(sighs)
Lay off Booth?

24:04.399 --> 24:07.001
Yes, and run triturated
laundry detergent

24:07.035 --> 24:09.136
through the printer drum
instead of toner.

24:09.170 --> 24:10.838
Why?

24:10.872 --> 24:12.773
Um, because laundry detergents
contain triazine-stilbenes

24:12.807 --> 24:15.876
and benzoxazolines.

24:15.911 --> 24:17.211
You know what?

24:17.245 --> 24:18.779
I don't need to know why,

24:18.813 --> 24:20.453
because I've learned
to have faith in you,

24:20.482 --> 24:22.616
even when you use words
like "triturate."

24:22.651 --> 24:24.151
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

24:24.185 --> 24:26.053
DAISY:
<i>Sharp-force trauma accounts</i>

24:26.087 --> 24:27.755
for almost all
the injuries

24:27.789 --> 24:30.591
postdating the remodeled
fractures the victim sustained

24:30.625 --> 24:32.559
in the explosion
six years ago,

24:32.594 --> 24:34.328
congruent with
multiple strikes

24:34.362 --> 24:36.196
from the air-conditioning
unit blades.

24:36.231 --> 24:38.766
Those injuries are obscuring
the cause of death.

24:38.800 --> 24:40.167
We need to ask ourselves,

24:40.201 --> 24:42.169
what injuries
match the height

24:42.203 --> 24:44.638
of the blood spatter
in the hotel room?

24:48.476 --> 24:51.645
DAISY: Two and a half
to three meters.

24:51.680 --> 24:53.380
So, head wound.

24:53.415 --> 24:56.083
Here in the right
temporoparietal.

24:56.117 --> 25:00.821
The injury measures
62.8 by 35.2 millimeters.

25:00.855 --> 25:02.690
There's another impact
on the left temporoparietal.

25:02.724 --> 25:06.627
Both wounds are consistent
with a slow-loading force.

25:06.661 --> 25:09.863
So, not from the blades
or the fall.

25:09.898 --> 25:12.266
A low-velocity
blunt trauma.

25:12.300 --> 25:14.268
He was conked
on the head... twice.

25:14.302 --> 25:16.270
Which gives us
cause of death.

25:16.304 --> 25:17.671
Would you care
to high-five?

25:17.706 --> 25:19.006
I would not.

25:19.040 --> 25:21.108
I can do it myself.

25:27.315 --> 25:28.716
BRENNAN: Cam?
MONTENEGRO: Cam?

25:28.750 --> 25:31.218
Okay. How about
you come out in here and see me?

25:31.252 --> 25:33.120
First come, first served.

25:33.154 --> 25:34.388
We've ascertained cause of death.
It was lateral thinking...

25:34.422 --> 25:36.857
(overlapping chatter)

25:36.891 --> 25:38.258
Stop.

25:38.293 --> 25:40.394
(chatter stops)
Dr. Brennan.

25:40.428 --> 25:43.564
Cause of death was two
blows to the head. Angela?

25:43.598 --> 25:47.267
The last thing the victim
printed was a photograph.

25:47.302 --> 25:49.603
A white cat in a snowstorm?

25:49.637 --> 25:52.006
MONTENEGRO:
It's a ghost of

25:52.040 --> 25:54.541
the last photo that came
out of his printer.

25:54.576 --> 25:57.011
Ooh, sexy hotel sex.

26:00.882 --> 26:02.516
That's the room
at the Lightfoot.

26:02.550 --> 26:04.618
Hey, the logo on the
headboard is the same

26:04.652 --> 26:06.954
in this photograph.
SAROYAN: That could be Lily Thorn.

26:06.988 --> 26:08.389
Oh, it could also be me.

26:08.423 --> 26:11.025
We'd all understand
if it were.

26:11.059 --> 26:12.626
BRENNAN:
It's not. I'm just saying

26:12.660 --> 26:15.396
that she's not identifiable.

26:15.430 --> 26:17.464
Body type tells us
that this man's not the victim.

26:17.499 --> 26:19.500
DAISY: Oh, you think
the victim interrupted

26:19.534 --> 26:21.902
this liaison, and this man
hit him with a blunt object

26:21.936 --> 26:23.203
and threw him out the window?

26:23.238 --> 26:25.239
How do we identify the man?

26:25.273 --> 26:26.707
Well, his name
is H. Gloeckner.

26:26.741 --> 26:27.875
How did you know that?

26:27.909 --> 26:29.109
It's on his briefcase.

26:29.144 --> 26:30.878
H. Gloeckner.

26:38.886 --> 26:40.721
<i>My name is Heinrich Gloeckner.</i>

26:40.755 --> 26:42.122
I am chief
executive officer

26:42.156 --> 26:44.124
of Gloeckner AG based
in Hamburg, Germany.

26:44.158 --> 26:46.193
AG? Doesn't that mean

26:46.227 --> 26:48.595
it's a public corporation
with shareholders and a board?

26:48.630 --> 26:50.263
Yes. Which is why I'm here,

26:50.298 --> 26:51.932
cooperating,
in the hopes

26:51.966 --> 26:53.767
you will be discreet
when you realize

26:53.801 --> 26:55.669
I had nothing to do with this murder.
Right, okay.

26:55.703 --> 26:57.704
Well, let's say we play a little
game of show-and-tell, huh?

26:57.739 --> 26:59.272
Shall we?
Let's start with the

26:59.307 --> 27:01.475
identity of this young woman
right here.

27:01.509 --> 27:04.244
Um, she gave me the name Melody.

27:04.278 --> 27:06.013
I assume it was false.

27:06.047 --> 27:08.548
And?
Yes.

27:08.583 --> 27:10.317
This is Melody.
And?

27:10.351 --> 27:12.052
He said his
name was John.

27:12.086 --> 27:13.620
Also a lie, I assume.

27:13.655 --> 27:15.622
Were John and Melody
blackmailing you?

27:15.657 --> 27:17.090
No, it did not
come to that.

27:17.125 --> 27:18.825
John showed me this photo

27:18.860 --> 27:21.528
to demonstrate he had other,
more incriminating photos

27:21.562 --> 27:23.363
if I reneged on our deal.

27:23.398 --> 27:25.599
What deal?
John wanted my company

27:25.633 --> 27:28.135
to employ a team
of outside consultants to work

27:28.169 --> 27:30.337
on a Chinese
dam project.

27:30.371 --> 27:32.873
Your company makes dams?
My company makes pumps.

27:32.907 --> 27:34.241
BOOTH:
Pumps?

27:34.275 --> 27:35.542
Um, this is the, uh...

27:35.576 --> 27:36.576
the team of
consultants

27:36.611 --> 27:39.112
based in Terre Haute,
Indiana.

27:39.147 --> 27:40.914
Why?
I assumed

27:40.948 --> 27:43.116
John and Melody
were American spies

27:43.151 --> 27:46.586
who were looking to find a way
into the Chinese mega-projects.

27:46.621 --> 27:48.822
Is the consulting contract
worth a lot of money?

27:48.856 --> 27:50.023
No. It's a pittance.

27:50.058 --> 27:52.426
Certainly not worth killing for.

27:52.460 --> 27:54.227
She made me think she liked me.

27:54.262 --> 27:55.429
BOOTH:
And you met

27:55.463 --> 27:57.731
with Melody at...?
Perhaps 10:00.

27:57.765 --> 28:00.100
Uh, she left my room
after midnight.

28:00.134 --> 28:02.502
John came in, showed me
the photo, and I left.

28:02.537 --> 28:04.438
What time?
Before 1:00 a.m.

28:05.440 --> 28:07.441
I can go?

28:07.475 --> 28:09.676
Afraid not.

28:09.711 --> 28:12.112
Agent Booth, do I strike you
as a kind of man

28:12.146 --> 28:15.415
who would be foolish enough
to murder a CIA agent?

28:19.420 --> 28:22.189
Angela, how long have
you been with Hodgins?

28:22.223 --> 28:24.591
Um, working together ten years,

28:24.625 --> 28:26.460
sleeping together
five years

28:26.494 --> 28:27.861
and married three years.

28:27.895 --> 28:29.429
With regard to the
murder weapon, we should

28:29.464 --> 28:31.298
try to be more specific.
Yes, Dr. Brennan.

28:31.332 --> 28:32.866
Wait. What?
We should figure out

28:32.900 --> 28:35.102
if it's a pipe or
a baseball bat

28:35.136 --> 28:36.970
or something else.
No, I mean,

28:37.004 --> 28:38.805
you can't just ask
a loaded question

28:38.840 --> 28:40.560
like, "How long have
you been with Hodgins?"

28:40.575 --> 28:42.442
and then go back
to work stuff.

28:42.477 --> 28:45.045
I wanted to compare
your experience with Hodgins

28:45.079 --> 28:48.315
to recent
brain chemistry discoveries

28:48.349 --> 28:49.850
and my current situation
with Booth.

28:49.884 --> 28:52.018
"What recent brain
chemistry discoveries?"

28:52.053 --> 28:54.020
she asked, even though
she doesn't care.

28:54.055 --> 28:56.423
Phase one of what we call love

28:56.457 --> 28:59.626
is an overload
of neurotransmitters.

28:59.660 --> 29:02.329
It feels like falling.
Thus, falling in love.

29:02.363 --> 29:05.899
Exactly. Phase one
lasts less than a year.

29:05.933 --> 29:08.235
No, no, no.
DAISY: Phase two involves

29:08.269 --> 29:10.303
the production of oxytocin
and vasopressin,

29:10.338 --> 29:11.838
particularly after orgasm.

29:11.873 --> 29:14.107
That's correct.
Lance and I

29:14.142 --> 29:15.509
had a lot of phase two.

29:15.543 --> 29:17.811
BRENNAN:
Phase two either evolves

29:17.845 --> 29:23.150
into long-term attachment or,
much more frequently, fails,

29:23.184 --> 29:27.721
and the search begins for
another phase one stimulation

29:27.755 --> 29:30.657
with... a new lover.

29:33.427 --> 29:35.996
Love is not chemistry.

29:36.030 --> 29:37.898
DAISY: I'm sensing
you have evidence

29:37.932 --> 29:39.466
that Booth's neocortex

29:39.500 --> 29:43.270
is propelling him towards
new phase one stimulation?

29:45.006 --> 29:47.374
Booth has been going
to a strip club.

29:47.408 --> 29:49.576
That-that does
not sound right.

29:49.610 --> 29:52.746
Well, I found several of these
in his pocket.

29:52.780 --> 29:54.447
Paradise Lost?

29:54.482 --> 29:57.517
Starting over
isn't so bad, Dr. Brennan.

29:57.552 --> 29:58.885
Lance and I are friends now.

29:58.920 --> 30:00.187
Stop talking, Daisy.
You and Booth

30:00.221 --> 30:02.222
will be just like
me and Lance, I prom...

30:02.256 --> 30:04.457
Oh.
Angela!

30:04.492 --> 30:05.759
I warned her.

30:05.793 --> 30:07.427
Everybody heard me.

30:13.134 --> 30:14.668
We know that you were involved

30:14.702 --> 30:16.903
in a sex sting
on a foreign national.

30:16.938 --> 30:18.238
Don't say a word.

30:18.272 --> 30:19.706
We don't think
you killed anyone.

30:19.740 --> 30:21.575
We also know that
Jonas Siedel recruited you

30:21.609 --> 30:22.909
on behalf of the CIA.

30:22.944 --> 30:25.245
What?

30:25.279 --> 30:27.647
Is that true?

30:27.682 --> 30:31.618
Mom, you're supposed to be
my lawyer in here, not my mom.

30:31.652 --> 30:33.019
You've been lying to me?

30:33.054 --> 30:34.621
BOOTH: Jonas didn't
call the shots.

30:34.655 --> 30:37.157
Lily here set the honey pot.
It's my job

30:37.191 --> 30:38.959
to keep secrets, Agent Booth.

30:38.993 --> 30:40.627
I can't help you.

30:40.661 --> 30:42.229
This interview is over.

30:42.263 --> 30:43.730
My lawyer is,
for once, right.

30:43.764 --> 30:45.632
Look, Lily, what if
I could persuade you

30:45.666 --> 30:47.801
just to answer a couple
more questions?

30:47.835 --> 30:49.135
I don't think that's possible.

30:49.170 --> 30:50.704
If this operation
was as top secret

30:50.738 --> 30:52.539
as you thought it was,
don't you think

30:52.573 --> 30:55.075
Danny and the CIA would
have shut us down by now?

30:55.109 --> 30:58.745
In fact, I think Danny worked it
so that I would catch him.

30:58.779 --> 31:00.747
Might as well have told us
Jonas Siedel's murder

31:00.781 --> 31:01.982
didn't have anything to do

31:02.016 --> 31:03.350
with his CIA work.

31:03.384 --> 31:05.185
BOOTH: Whether you like
Jonas Siedel or not,

31:05.219 --> 31:08.088
you could at least help us
catch his killer.

31:08.122 --> 31:10.223
CAROLINE:
Even your mama

31:10.258 --> 31:11.191
would agree with that.

31:11.225 --> 31:12.792
I certainly do not agree.

31:12.827 --> 31:14.594
Mom, you're gonna
have to leave.

31:14.629 --> 31:16.363
What?

31:16.397 --> 31:18.131
Honey, I am your lawyer.

31:18.165 --> 31:20.667
I don't need a lawyer.

31:30.011 --> 31:31.411
What do you want to know?

31:31.445 --> 31:32.846
So, when you
last saw Jonas,

31:32.880 --> 31:35.115
he was with the German?
Yes.

31:35.149 --> 31:37.517
Around midnight.
CAROLINE: You see that German

31:37.551 --> 31:38.652
killing Jonas?

31:38.686 --> 31:39.619
No.

31:39.654 --> 31:41.454
Did you see anyone else?

31:41.489 --> 31:44.057
Earlier in the evening,
my mother was at the bar.

31:44.091 --> 31:45.325
By coincidence.

31:45.359 --> 31:46.693
I'm afraid
she formed

31:46.727 --> 31:48.428
the idea that I was an escort.

31:48.462 --> 31:50.130
Imagine her relief
when she found out

31:50.164 --> 31:52.065
you were a patriot.

31:57.238 --> 31:59.005
Thanks for helping us out.

32:09.817 --> 32:12.619
Dr. Brennan,
your report states

32:12.653 --> 32:15.289
that the Band-Aid we found was
likely on Jonas Siedel's jaw?

32:15.314 --> 32:16.623
Yes.

32:16.624 --> 32:18.925
The tissue trauma's size
and severity

32:18.960 --> 32:22.329
matches the bone bruising
to the left mandible.

32:23.831 --> 32:25.098
Given that you

32:25.132 --> 32:26.766
are still in the...

32:26.801 --> 32:30.070
first year
of your sexual relationship

32:30.104 --> 32:32.072
with Arastoo
and so deeply

32:32.106 --> 32:33.640
in the grip of dopamine...

32:33.674 --> 32:35.342
I know this is
about Booth,

32:35.376 --> 32:38.278
and my advice to you
would be to trust him.

32:38.312 --> 32:40.113
I feel the intense feelings
of romantic love

32:40.147 --> 32:42.482
are fading from our relationship.
Have you looked

32:42.516 --> 32:45.251
at Booth lately? He's miserable.

32:45.286 --> 32:47.554
If what you're suggesting
were actually true,

32:47.588 --> 32:50.623
you'd both be
experiencing relief.

32:50.658 --> 32:53.126
Do you feel relieved?

32:54.495 --> 32:56.963
I don't always know
what I'm feeling.

32:56.998 --> 32:58.965
Well, you are not
relieved, Dr. Brennan.

32:59.000 --> 33:00.900
You're miserable.
And so is Booth.

33:00.935 --> 33:02.936
And that is love.

33:04.805 --> 33:06.172
The...

33:06.207 --> 33:08.375
blow to the victim's jaw

33:08.409 --> 33:10.910
took place approximately
eight hours before his death,

33:10.945 --> 33:13.213
so I'm... not sure
they're related.

33:13.247 --> 33:15.661
Dr. Hodgins found traces of rose oil
in the Band-Aid.

33:15.686 --> 33:17.250
So he was struck

33:17.251 --> 33:19.319
with something made of leather?
Something made of

33:19.353 --> 33:21.187
really, really expensive
leather.

33:21.222 --> 33:24.257
I'd appreciate it if you
passed this information

33:24.291 --> 33:25.725
on to Booth.
No.

33:25.760 --> 33:27.193
Why can't you do it?

33:27.228 --> 33:29.262
Because I'm asking you
to do it, please.

33:30.197 --> 33:32.732
Cam...

33:54.221 --> 33:57.057
Wow. Okay, well, thanks
for meeting us here, Ms. Thorn.

33:57.091 --> 33:58.858
Who is this?
This...

33:58.893 --> 34:01.628
Oh, this here is my associate,
Dr. Temperance Brennan from the

34:01.662 --> 34:03.029
Jeffersonian
Institution.

34:03.064 --> 34:04.330
Smart girl, huh?

34:04.365 --> 34:05.965
Yes. Very smart.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.301
You have a cruel sense of humor,
asking me to the hotel

34:08.335 --> 34:09.702
where my daughter
plies her trade

34:09.737 --> 34:13.505
as what is apparently a...
patriotic prostitute.

34:13.541 --> 34:16.943
Well, she told us that you
thought that she was an escort.

34:16.976 --> 34:20.480
Oh, God, well, uh, Lily had
become very evasive lately,

34:20.514 --> 34:21.880
so I followed her here.

34:21.916 --> 34:23.283
She was all dolled up,

34:23.317 --> 34:25.952
talking to a man
about meeting another man.

34:25.985 --> 34:27.687
And I jumped to conclusions.
What is this?

34:27.721 --> 34:29.422
It's a warrant for
your briefcase.

34:29.456 --> 34:31.291
BOOTH:
Yeah, the $5,000 briefcase

34:31.324 --> 34:32.926
you hit Jonas Siedel with

34:32.960 --> 34:34.561
because you thought
he was your daughter's pimp.

34:34.594 --> 34:38.297
You're under arrest,
Marianne Thorn, for the murder

34:38.331 --> 34:40.533
of Jonas Siedel.
Based on particulate evidence.

34:40.568 --> 34:42.402
That can be easily
explain away in court.

34:42.436 --> 34:44.137
Besides, brainiac here
will tell you

34:44.170 --> 34:46.672
that whoever hit Jonas Siedel
in the jaw with my briefcase

34:46.706 --> 34:48.608
did it several hours
before he died.

34:48.641 --> 34:50.076
We never said where you hit him.

34:50.110 --> 34:52.078
Right. She got you.
Come on. Let's go.

34:52.112 --> 34:55.181
I stipulate to the assault.

34:56.250 --> 34:57.383
It's cruel
and unusual punishment

34:57.418 --> 34:59.018
not to let a woman
finish her martini

34:59.053 --> 35:00.553
after the day I've had.

35:00.588 --> 35:02.922
Well, I have to get my digs
in somehow, Ms. Thorn.

35:02.957 --> 35:04.924
Come on. Really?

35:04.959 --> 35:06.226
Really. Okay.

35:06.260 --> 35:07.727
That's it.

35:07.761 --> 35:09.162
All right.

35:19.071 --> 35:20.938
Oh, come on in.

35:20.973 --> 35:22.406
It's ladies' night.

35:24.343 --> 35:26.777
There are no ladies here.

35:26.812 --> 35:28.112
Uh, maybe

35:28.146 --> 35:30.081
you're the beginning of a trend.

35:30.115 --> 35:31.816
Wine?

35:31.850 --> 35:35.586
I... I'll have
the ladies' special.

35:46.899 --> 35:48.399
You're Booth's girl?

35:50.269 --> 35:51.769
Temperance Brennan?

35:51.803 --> 35:53.104
I wouldn't use the term "girl."

35:53.138 --> 35:54.872
I'm Aldo Clemens.

35:54.907 --> 35:57.241
I used to be Booth's confessor
when he was a Ranger.

35:57.276 --> 35:59.944
Me and him are having a
tough time breaking the habit

35:59.978 --> 36:02.079
even though Booth's the reason
I quit being a priest

36:02.114 --> 36:04.315
and decided God
was my worst enemy.

36:04.349 --> 36:05.917
God is a myth.

36:05.951 --> 36:07.652
No, I don't think so.

36:07.686 --> 36:10.288
I think he's a bastard.

36:12.958 --> 36:14.825
Booth was a sniper.

36:16.028 --> 36:18.863
He asked for forgiveness
from you

36:18.897 --> 36:20.264
every time he killed somebody?

36:20.299 --> 36:22.466
Through me,
technically.

36:22.501 --> 36:23.868
You can imagine why a guy

36:23.902 --> 36:26.037
might get soul-sick
providing absolution.

36:26.071 --> 36:28.973
I don't believe in souls,
either.

36:30.342 --> 36:32.109
Booth loves you.

36:32.144 --> 36:34.245
Booth told you that?

36:34.279 --> 36:35.680
He confessed it to me.

36:35.714 --> 36:38.015
Not being married
is a sin to him.

36:38.050 --> 36:39.684
I'm not sure
a nonbeliever

36:39.718 --> 36:42.486
can understand that kind
of sacrifice.

36:43.822 --> 36:46.257
I wanted to marry him.

36:46.291 --> 36:49.193
Not as much as he wants
to marry you.

36:56.535 --> 36:58.402
Do you want me
to have faith in him?

36:58.437 --> 37:00.504
You know, I've
seen Booth do some

37:00.539 --> 37:04.542
terrible and...
and difficult things,

37:04.576 --> 37:06.844
but only if he

37:06.878 --> 37:09.647
was compelled
by a very good reason.

37:21.393 --> 37:23.194
Are you asleep?

37:23.228 --> 37:25.496
If you are, I'd like you
to wake up now.

37:25.530 --> 37:29.233
I watched the tapes of you
interrogating that lawyer lady.

37:29.267 --> 37:31.002
You weren't very nice.

37:31.036 --> 37:33.404
As if I needed
another reason to adore you.

37:33.438 --> 37:35.006
So what do you think?

37:35.040 --> 37:36.320
I think she's telling the truth.

37:36.341 --> 37:37.508
(Booth sighs)

37:37.542 --> 37:38.976
Which leaves us nowhere.

37:39.011 --> 37:40.645
So why are you sleeping?

37:42.447 --> 37:43.614
(sighs)

37:43.649 --> 37:46.117
BOOTH:
Oh!

37:46.151 --> 37:47.918
MONTENEGRO:
That's cause of death.

37:47.953 --> 37:50.194
So, anything we found in
the hotel room match the weapon?

37:50.222 --> 37:52.390
No. Meaning the killer brought

37:52.424 --> 37:54.091
a three-foot-long pole with him,

37:54.126 --> 37:55.559
conked Siedel
on the head, and then

37:55.594 --> 37:56.794
took it with him when he left?

37:56.828 --> 37:58.195
So it's a cane?
Well, if a cane

37:58.230 --> 38:00.197
could bend. See, it
struck him here,

38:00.232 --> 38:01.532
and then wrapped around there.

38:01.566 --> 38:03.067
And there was
something on the end

38:03.101 --> 38:06.203
of whatever that was
that whipped into his temple.

38:08.640 --> 38:10.274
What are you thinking, Booth?

38:10.308 --> 38:11.942
You know,
everyone was fooled

38:11.977 --> 38:14.712
by this innocent-looking girl:
me, Sweets, the mother.

38:14.746 --> 38:17.114
So you think the murderer was
someone else who misread her?

38:17.149 --> 38:18.549
All I'm saying is

38:18.583 --> 38:20.384
when we took Lily Thorn in
for questioning,

38:20.419 --> 38:23.688
her boss seemed to think
that she could do no wrong.

38:23.722 --> 38:27.425
Does Lily's boss carry around
a weirdly flexible cane

38:27.459 --> 38:29.126
that could smash a temple?

38:45.477 --> 38:49.013
I thought Jonas
was taking advantage of Lily,

38:49.047 --> 38:51.082
using his superior position
to press her

38:51.116 --> 38:52.883
into having an affair with him.

38:54.252 --> 38:57.321
So I followed him
to that hotel, and he...

38:59.291 --> 39:02.226
...he gave her to another man.

39:03.628 --> 39:05.129
(handcuffs rattling)

39:05.163 --> 39:07.998
I confronted him, and he said it
was none of my business.

39:08.033 --> 39:10.234
I just, I snapped.

39:10.268 --> 39:11.669
I didn't mean to kill him.

39:11.703 --> 39:14.338
I did it for you.

39:18.810 --> 39:23.147
♪ What could make this night

39:23.181 --> 39:27.384
♪ Without you at my side?

39:27.419 --> 39:32.022
♪ I catch myself instead

39:32.057 --> 39:37.495
♪ Staring straight ahead...

39:44.236 --> 39:45.870
DANNY:
Got the guy, huh?

39:45.904 --> 39:48.105
Yeah, we got the guy...

39:48.140 --> 39:50.107
thanks to you.
I didn't do anything.

39:50.142 --> 39:52.877
I mean, seriously, if anyone
asks, I didn't do anything.

39:52.911 --> 39:54.145
(chuckles) Okay.

39:54.179 --> 39:55.312
What do you want, Danny?

39:55.347 --> 39:56.547
To tell you we owe you one.

39:56.581 --> 39:58.883
The CIA owes me one?

39:58.917 --> 40:00.785
You don't got to put labels
on everything, Booth.

40:00.819 --> 40:03.120
I said we owe you one,
we owe you one.

40:03.155 --> 40:05.689
All right, you owe me one.
Thanks.

40:05.724 --> 40:08.159
And you know there's
always a place for you with us,

40:08.193 --> 40:11.729
you ever decide to leave this...
cute little job you got here.

40:11.763 --> 40:13.631
Well, the way things
are going right now,

40:13.665 --> 40:15.733
I might just take you up
on that.

40:17.068 --> 40:18.702
Take care.

40:18.737 --> 40:20.371
Yeah.

40:28.413 --> 40:30.514
(sighs)

40:31.583 --> 40:34.018
(door opens and closes)

40:34.052 --> 40:35.452
Did he confess?

40:35.487 --> 40:38.022
Yeah. He was hoping
that no one would be able

40:38.056 --> 40:41.926
to identify the body
or see the cause of death

40:41.960 --> 40:44.528
if he dumped the body

40:44.563 --> 40:47.498
into the
air-conditioning unit.

40:51.102 --> 40:53.470
Booth, I have
to tell you something.

40:53.505 --> 40:55.906
Uh, all right, look,
Bones, please, just...

40:55.941 --> 40:59.210
you just got to give me a little
more time, that's all, please.

40:59.244 --> 41:01.212
No, Booth, I'm not...

41:03.048 --> 41:06.383
I'm not leaving you.

41:14.426 --> 41:16.060
What I want to tell you

41:16.094 --> 41:19.463
is that I have
absolute faith in you.

41:22.734 --> 41:25.035
I trust you.

41:27.172 --> 41:31.408
I know you love me
and Christine, and...

41:33.245 --> 41:36.480
I'm sorry I lost sight
of that temporarily.

41:39.417 --> 41:42.253
You're a good man.

41:42.287 --> 41:45.289
You have your
reasons, and...

41:45.323 --> 41:47.558
(chuckles)

41:47.592 --> 41:50.394
...when you can,
you'll share them with me.

41:55.100 --> 41:57.835
I'm sorry.

41:57.869 --> 42:00.604
Look, I'm sorry...

42:02.574 --> 42:04.942
We'll be fine.

42:04.976 --> 42:06.977
But next time,

42:07.012 --> 42:10.281
it's your turn
to ask me to marry you.

42:11.483 --> 42:14.318
I will.

42:15.787 --> 42:17.755
As soon as I can, I will.

42:18.990 --> 42:21.091
I know. (chuckles)
