WEBVTT

00:31.990 --> 00:32.949
Yep.

00:33.825 --> 00:34.659
Yep.

00:35.368 --> 00:36.244
Yup.

00:36.786 --> 00:38.038
-Mm-hmm.

00:38.121 --> 00:40.331


00:40.415 --> 00:41.458
How do, Hank?

00:41.541 --> 00:42.375
Pretty good.

00:42.709 --> 00:45.378
You know, you already delivered
my paper this morning.

00:45.462 --> 00:48.423
Yeah. I just wanted to wish you
a Merry Christmas in person

00:48.506 --> 00:51.009
instead of leaving you
some tacky store-bought card.

00:51.092 --> 00:54.220
Well, thanks, Harve, but uh, it's April.

00:54.304 --> 00:56.723
Yeah. Normally I'd wait till December,

00:56.806 --> 00:58.808
but <i>The Bystander's</i> got a new owner.

00:58.892 --> 01:01.019
Or should I say new bastard?

01:01.102 --> 01:03.354
I prefer new bastard. Thanks.

01:03.438 --> 01:07.192
First thing he's doing is replacing
all us delivery guys with kids.

01:07.275 --> 01:10.737
Apparently, we're not the face
they want for the new <i>Bystander.</i>

01:11.821 --> 01:14.908
Huh. Well, that's, uh... Yeah.

01:14.991 --> 01:18.328
Meanwhile, they keep taxing
old Harve's cigs.

01:23.833 --> 01:24.918
Okay, then.

01:25.251 --> 01:26.586
Merry Christmas.

01:27.629 --> 01:28.963
Mm...

01:30.548 --> 01:32.842
I can't believe they're only hiring kids.

01:32.926 --> 01:35.720
I always dreamed
of having a newspaper route.

01:35.804 --> 01:39.557
Now my hopes have been raised
and dashed in a matter of moments.

01:39.641 --> 01:41.184
I have hope-lash.

01:41.267 --> 01:43.895
You know, a newspaper route
could be great for Bobby.

01:43.978 --> 01:44.896
He has a bike,

01:44.979 --> 01:46.815
and it could be a way
to teach him to throw

01:46.898 --> 01:48.942
without scaring him with a ball.

01:51.069 --> 01:53.530
You know, my ex-wife slept with Harve.

01:54.114 --> 01:55.490
Couple of times.

01:55.698 --> 01:58.409
<i>We hope
you enjoyed our million-dollar movie.</i>

01:58.493 --> 02:00.662
Which would have been
a hundred-million-dollar movie

02:00.745 --> 02:04.374
had they cast Tom Cruise
and Tom Hanks instead of Gary Busey.

02:04.457 --> 02:05.875
Bobby. Good news.

02:05.959 --> 02:07.085
All right.

02:07.168 --> 02:09.003
You're gonna be a paper boy.

02:09.087 --> 02:10.255
-Yeah?
-Yup.

02:10.338 --> 02:14.467
The new owner of the <i>Bystander</i>
is bringing back old-timey paperboys.

02:14.551 --> 02:17.387
New owners? Regime change.

02:17.470 --> 02:21.808
Just think. You'll make ten dollars
before the rest of Arlen even wakes up.

02:21.891 --> 02:23.143
Oh, well...

02:23.226 --> 02:25.687
you know, I'm not really a morning person.

02:25.770 --> 02:28.523
Well, you are now.
Sign-ups are are tomorrow.

02:29.357 --> 02:31.568
This isn't just Bobby's lucky day.

02:31.651 --> 02:32.694
It's mine, too.

02:32.777 --> 02:35.363
The old <i>Bystander's</i>
answer to my story ideas

02:35.446 --> 02:37.407
was always "no, no, no."

02:37.490 --> 02:39.868
But now that heads
are rolling in that newsroom,

02:39.951 --> 02:42.203
I am throwing my head into the ring.

02:42.287 --> 02:43.663
Good for you, Peggy.

02:43.746 --> 02:45.665
And once I get a job at the paper,

02:45.748 --> 02:48.042
I won't need to keep pouring
my creative juices

02:48.126 --> 02:51.588
into these DVD commentaries
that, let's be honest,

02:51.671 --> 02:54.048
no one but you was ever gonna hear.

02:54.132 --> 02:56.634
That makes this one a collector's item.

02:56.718 --> 02:57.802
Enjoy.

03:00.847 --> 03:03.099
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

03:03.725 --> 03:06.686
Is your dad making you
get a paper route too?

03:06.769 --> 03:08.813
I'm building character.

03:08.897 --> 03:09.731
Hey, dude.

03:09.814 --> 03:12.400
Is this where I sign up for the jizzob?

03:12.483 --> 03:13.943
Hi, Mr. Gribble.

03:14.027 --> 03:16.070
Grib what? I'm Sparky Wilson.

03:16.154 --> 03:19.574
And I moved here with my mom
when my dad left us.

03:20.700 --> 03:22.327
Ah, dang it.

03:22.410 --> 03:25.246
It's not fair that only kids
get a paper route.

03:25.330 --> 03:27.040
Believe me, if there was any way

03:27.123 --> 03:30.293
I could trade places with you,
Mr. Gribble, I would.

03:30.752 --> 03:32.003
Hmm...

03:32.629 --> 03:36.466
What if my want of a paper route
joined up with your un-want?

03:37.550 --> 03:39.177
You sign up, I do all the work.

03:40.303 --> 03:41.429
I don't know.

03:41.512 --> 03:43.640
If I'm still in bed when my dad gets up,

03:43.723 --> 03:45.934
he's gonna know
there's something going on.

03:47.060 --> 03:49.979
Once again, your dad does
present a problem.

03:50.063 --> 03:51.064
Ah...

03:51.648 --> 03:54.442
Hey, you could sleep
in the Bugabago during the route.

03:54.525 --> 03:57.487
I've got a cot back there
for marsupial stake-outs.

03:57.904 --> 04:00.156
Well... I'm not sure...

04:00.240 --> 04:04.160
Fine. Enjoy your nice, cold,
dark bike ride.

04:04.244 --> 04:07.247
Hey, you! Bird chest!
Interested in a deal?

04:07.330 --> 04:08.248
Wait.

04:10.583 --> 04:11.709
I'm in.

04:11.793 --> 04:12.752
Yes.

04:12.835 --> 04:15.255
Dude, I am totally stoked.

04:18.633 --> 04:19.801
Rad.

04:20.718 --> 04:22.178
What do you think, Hank?

04:22.262 --> 04:23.972
For my interview with the managing editor

04:24.055 --> 04:26.641
I decided to go
with my "knock them dead" shirt!

04:26.724 --> 04:27.767
Good choice.

04:27.850 --> 04:31.521
Wow. You'll write the paper.
Bobby'll toss it on our stoop,

04:31.604 --> 04:33.523
And Ladybird will bring it to me.

04:35.566 --> 04:36.442
Here we go.

04:36.526 --> 04:38.736
His-and-hers copies of <i>New York Times.</i>

04:38.820 --> 04:41.656
You ready for crossword competition?

04:46.035 --> 04:47.370
-Go.
-Yeah.

04:49.872 --> 04:51.082
Oh, for God's sake.

04:51.374 --> 04:54.085
Un-freakin'-believable.

04:54.168 --> 04:56.671
Hey, Peggy Hill, pipe down.

04:56.754 --> 04:58.548
We trying to match wits over here.

04:58.631 --> 05:00.258
But I have got a major job interview

05:00.341 --> 05:02.635
and I just spilled coffee
all over my blouse.

05:02.719 --> 05:04.012
Ooh, a stain?

05:04.095 --> 05:06.681
Is that what you're caterwauling about?
Remove it!

05:06.764 --> 05:10.435
If I knew how to get a huge
coffee stain out of silk, I would do it.

05:10.518 --> 05:11.728
But I do not.

05:11.811 --> 05:14.230
Hmm. A housewife that can't clean.

05:14.314 --> 05:16.816
What exactly does Hank Hill
keep you around for?

05:17.859 --> 05:20.737
This. I live the life of the mind, Minh.

05:20.820 --> 05:22.655
I am a thinker, a writer.

05:22.739 --> 05:23.906
Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever.

05:23.990 --> 05:27.118
Just soak stain in lime juice,
dab gently and quit your hollering.

05:27.201 --> 05:29.579
Well, I do not have time
for soaking and dabbing.

05:29.662 --> 05:31.914
I'm gonna have to change
into my funeral shirt.

05:34.876 --> 05:36.878
Hmm...

05:36.961 --> 05:39.547
So I see you didn't go to J. school.
I like that.

05:39.630 --> 05:43.092
Not only did I not go to J. school,
I don't even know what it is.

05:43.176 --> 05:45.845
It's journalism school,
but that's all you need to know about it.

05:45.928 --> 05:48.765
I'm looking for people
who have a homespun wisdom

05:48.848 --> 05:50.933
that can only come
from living a real life.

05:51.017 --> 05:54.479
A realer life than mine
you would be hard pressed to find, sir.

05:54.562 --> 05:57.357
Well, that's dandy.
I'll tell you what our readers would love.

05:57.440 --> 05:58.691
A "Helpful Hints" column.

05:58.775 --> 06:00.068
Care to take a whack at it?

06:00.151 --> 06:02.862
"Helpful Hints?" Like who to vote for?

06:02.945 --> 06:03.988
Great books to read?

06:04.072 --> 06:04.989
How to think?

06:05.073 --> 06:06.616
Oh, no, no, nothing like that.

06:06.699 --> 06:08.576
I'm talking about household hints.

06:08.659 --> 06:11.454
You know, getting rid of mildew,
treating stains.

06:11.871 --> 06:13.998
I have a feeling
you'd knock it out of the park.

06:14.082 --> 06:14.916
And from there,

06:14.999 --> 06:17.293
there's no telling how far you could go
with this paper.

06:18.252 --> 06:21.964
Mr. Biffel, would you believe
that just minutes before this interview

06:22.048 --> 06:24.550
I had a huge coffee stain on my blouse?

06:24.634 --> 06:25.843
I was lost

06:25.927 --> 06:29.514
until I thought about a little saying
my pappy used to tell me.

06:29.597 --> 06:31.224
Soak it in lime juice.

06:31.307 --> 06:34.352
That's exactly the kind of of gem
I'm looking for.

06:37.021 --> 06:40.441
Hey, do you know how to get
newspaper ink out of a white shirt?

06:40.733 --> 06:42.902
Of course I do.

06:42.985 --> 06:45.988
But you'll have to wait till tomorrow
to read all about it.

06:50.660 --> 06:52.328
Time out. Pens down.

06:53.162 --> 06:55.873
Minh, I was just thinking
about that great hint

06:55.957 --> 06:57.375
we were chatting about this morning.

06:57.458 --> 07:00.378
You know, the lime juice
on the coffee stain. Delightful.

07:00.461 --> 07:02.380
So do you have any other ones?

07:02.463 --> 07:04.715
Oh, sure. My mother-in-law, Laoma,

07:04.799 --> 07:06.717
loves to tell me
how to clean my house better.

07:06.801 --> 07:08.719
She has this way of scrubbing grout...

07:09.846 --> 07:13.474
Mm, I smell desperation.
What's the matter?

07:13.558 --> 07:16.686
You got to clean Jethro's overalls
before he come back from still?

07:16.811 --> 07:18.855
Minh great, Peggy bad.

07:18.938 --> 07:21.983
Look, I have got a "Household Hints"
column in <i>The Bystander,</i>

07:22.066 --> 07:23.568
and I don't know any.

07:23.651 --> 07:26.362
Help me. I will give you
whatever you want.

07:26.446 --> 07:29.449
I need nine-letter word
for subatomic-particle discoverer.

07:29.532 --> 07:30.658
You got that?

07:30.950 --> 07:32.368
Wait, I do.

07:32.743 --> 07:34.203
<i>The Bystander</i> has access

07:34.287 --> 07:36.747
to every paper's puzzle answers
a day early.

07:36.831 --> 07:37.832
Mm-hmm.

07:37.915 --> 07:40.626
Now, I have to write this column
five days a week.

07:40.710 --> 07:42.879
So you have to keep the pipeline open.

07:42.962 --> 07:44.297
I don't know.

07:44.380 --> 07:47.717
That's gonna mean talking
to mother-in-law an awful lot.

07:47.800 --> 07:50.052
Minh, where are you?

07:50.136 --> 07:54.557
You can run but you cannot hide
from my superior vocabulary.

07:54.640 --> 07:57.560
I want Sunday answers too!
And tomorrow's weather!

07:57.643 --> 07:59.520
I be like God.

08:05.067 --> 08:06.235
Uh.

08:15.620 --> 08:17.663
Oh, you can move that bag of rats.

08:17.747 --> 08:19.332
Or use it as a pillow.

08:24.420 --> 08:26.589
Uh, Bobby? A little help?

08:28.799 --> 08:31.802
It is so great to be trembling
from excitement

08:31.886 --> 08:33.888
instead of fear, eh?

08:36.933 --> 08:38.184
Yes.

08:44.857 --> 08:46.108
What? Huh?

08:46.192 --> 08:48.027
Well, steering works.

08:55.535 --> 08:59.163
Looks like someone
turned in their first column, eh?

08:59.247 --> 09:02.833
Oh, you're Bob Jenkins,
the "Eye on Arlen".

09:02.917 --> 09:05.002
-I'm Peggy...
-I'll learn your name

09:05.086 --> 09:07.088
if I read it in the <i>Bystander.</i>

09:07.922 --> 09:11.175
Just so you know,
I used to be "Eyes on Arlen"

09:11.259 --> 09:14.303
until Roddy Ray read my first piece
and threw it right back into my face.

09:14.387 --> 09:15.930
Hmm. Had a staple in it.

09:17.014 --> 09:17.890
He's just kidding ya.

09:17.974 --> 09:20.309
He had a brain tumor
and had to have his eye taken out.

09:20.393 --> 09:22.478
Oh. Oh, that's a relief.

09:22.895 --> 09:24.146
I'm a little nervous.

09:24.230 --> 09:26.524
Roddy Ray took my column
into the men's room.

09:26.607 --> 09:28.025
Is that good or bad?

09:28.109 --> 09:29.402
Mm-hmm, depends.

09:29.485 --> 09:31.988
If he comes out holding it, good news.

09:32.071 --> 09:34.073
If he's empty-handed, well...

09:35.741 --> 09:36.826
Won't be long now.

09:42.123 --> 09:44.083
Peggy, congratulations.

09:44.166 --> 09:46.586
This calls for a drink at The Lifeboat.

09:46.669 --> 09:47.920
New person buys.

09:52.758 --> 09:54.594
Oh, my God.

09:54.677 --> 09:57.305
There's <i>Channel Eighty-four's</i>
Burle Arlington.

09:57.388 --> 10:00.266
Oh, look. The mannequin convention
is in town.

10:00.683 --> 10:01.726
Hey, Burle,

10:01.809 --> 10:05.146
let's see if you can order a drink
without using a Teleprompter.

10:06.564 --> 10:08.107
You're doing a great job, Jenkins.

10:08.190 --> 10:11.819
I can't wait to wake up tomorrow
to find out what happened today.

10:13.654 --> 10:15.489
Peggy? What are you doing here?

10:15.573 --> 10:17.491
I am writing for <i>The Bystander.</i>

10:17.742 --> 10:18.993
but I have to tell you,

10:19.076 --> 10:21.621
I do not know if I can keep up
with these barbs.

10:21.704 --> 10:23.706
Oh, Sug, you gotta show them
you can dish it out

10:23.789 --> 10:24.999
or they'll eat you alive.

10:25.082 --> 10:26.292
Would you do me a favor?

10:26.375 --> 10:29.086
Could you just toss
a friendly little insult my way

10:29.170 --> 10:30.796
so I can get into the game?

10:30.880 --> 10:32.423
Sure, Sug, leave it to me.

10:32.923 --> 10:35.343
Congratulations on the new column, Peggy.

10:35.426 --> 10:37.970
I'm sure all seven
of <i>The Bystander's</i> readers

10:38.054 --> 10:39.096
will love it.

10:42.266 --> 10:44.393
Take that, you bleached-out tramp.

10:45.436 --> 10:46.729
Ooh...

10:46.812 --> 10:48.022
Thank you.

10:48.105 --> 10:50.274
...13, 14...

10:50.816 --> 10:53.152
and two for the great state of taxes.

10:53.235 --> 10:54.278
'Scuse me.

10:58.074 --> 11:00.534
Scab! Scab!

11:00.618 --> 11:02.328
He's the kid who took all our jobs!

11:02.411 --> 11:03.663
Ahh!

11:07.041 --> 11:10.127
Mr. Gribble!

11:22.139 --> 11:23.557
Wha...

11:23.641 --> 11:24.850
What time is it?

11:25.059 --> 11:26.769
Ten-thirty in the a.m.

11:26.852 --> 11:28.270
What a day.

11:28.354 --> 11:31.107
I was supposed to be at school at 8:15!

11:31.190 --> 11:33.317
I missed my science test.

11:34.110 --> 11:36.654
Why do we have all these extra papers?

11:36.737 --> 11:39.782
Huh. I don't know. Who cares? I'm tired.

11:39.865 --> 11:42.368
Mr. Gribble, my name's on this route.

11:42.451 --> 11:44.620
We have to deliver these papers!

11:44.704 --> 11:46.706
Whatever you say, Hank.

11:56.465 --> 11:59.552
Boy, last night Bobby reached
for a dinner roll,

11:59.635 --> 12:02.221
and I think I saw a muscle
in his throwing arm.

12:02.304 --> 12:04.682
Yeah, man. Well, I don't want
to kill your dang ol' buzz, man.

12:04.765 --> 12:07.893
But I tell you what. That little boy done
throws like them dang ol' Drifters, man.

12:07.977 --> 12:09.520
Talking about dang ol' "Up On the Roof".

12:09.603 --> 12:12.189
I also found my paper on Boomhauer's roof.

12:12.273 --> 12:16.026
Huh. I'll have to work with Bobby
on his toss mechanics.

12:16.527 --> 12:19.071
It's not easy being a paperboy, Hank!

12:25.411 --> 12:27.371
You know I've been getting
a lot of complaints

12:27.455 --> 12:29.415
about your throwing accuracy.

12:29.498 --> 12:31.542
You do know you're right-handed,
don't you?

12:31.625 --> 12:33.544
I'll work on it, Dad.

12:33.627 --> 12:35.212
You're Peggy Hill.

12:35.296 --> 12:36.881
I recognize you from your picture.

12:36.964 --> 12:39.341
And I recognize you as a fan.

12:39.425 --> 12:41.427
I loved your article last Friday.

12:41.510 --> 12:44.472
I went right out and put seaweed
on the oil on my driveway.

12:44.555 --> 12:47.641
Peggy, you saved my driveway
and my marriage.

12:50.352 --> 12:53.230
Yeah. I never heard about
that seaweed thing before.

12:53.314 --> 12:54.565
Where'd you come up with that?

12:55.399 --> 12:57.693
Hank, I want to talk about our marriage.

13:02.698 --> 13:04.200
I agree, Laoma.

13:04.283 --> 13:06.869
Nothing good enough for your little Kahn.

13:06.952 --> 13:08.788
That's why I would so appreciate you

13:08.871 --> 13:11.874
telling me how I might remove
a lipstick stain from his shirt.

13:11.957 --> 13:14.084
Mm-hmm. Here are tomorrow's answers,

13:14.168 --> 13:17.588
including a 15-letter
Shakespearean palindrome.

13:17.671 --> 13:20.716
I'm gonna fill that one in last,
pretend like it really stumping me.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.427
Oh, yes, Laoma, I'm still here.

13:23.511 --> 13:26.305
Oh, yes, I did hear you say

13:26.388 --> 13:29.141
my lipstick remind you
of Bangkok circus clown.

13:29.642 --> 13:32.102
No, I'm not taking a tone.

13:32.186 --> 13:36.023
I really do value your tips
to make myself look less freakish.

13:36.106 --> 13:38.734
Okay, now, that was uncalled for you

13:39.985 --> 13:42.154
Oh, no, no! Don't call her a...

13:42.238 --> 13:45.241
Yeah? Well, you know that couch
you sleep on when you stay here?

13:45.366 --> 13:49.495
It pull out.

13:49.578 --> 13:52.122
-No more tips.
-What? Well, she can't cut us off!

13:52.206 --> 13:54.208
What am I gonna do for my next column?

13:54.291 --> 13:56.293
Sorry. Guess you're on your own.

13:56.377 --> 13:59.421
Hey, maybe something about
turning corn cobs into pipes?

14:07.346 --> 14:11.809
Ah, the tyranny of the blank screen.
Writer's block, eh?

14:11.892 --> 14:14.645
When I get writer's block,
I drink five cups of coffee,

14:14.728 --> 14:17.523
eat five candy bars and cross my fingers.

14:17.606 --> 14:18.941
This may or may not help,

14:19.024 --> 14:22.403
But when I get writer's block,
I buy a prostitute.

14:38.043 --> 14:39.962
Dale, wake up.

14:40.045 --> 14:41.547
Wha...

14:41.922 --> 14:44.425
Oh, morning, Hank. I must've dozed off.

14:44.508 --> 14:48.220
Mm. Just five more minutes,
Mr. Gribble.

14:48.304 --> 14:49.597
-Bobby?
-Dad!

14:49.680 --> 14:51.640
Mr. Gribble, did you fall asleep?

14:51.724 --> 14:52.975
Uh, yes.

14:53.058 --> 14:56.103
And Bobby must have climbed
in the back of my van...

14:56.186 --> 14:57.438
with his bike...

14:57.938 --> 14:59.940
and papers.

15:01.108 --> 15:02.192
He made me do it.

15:02.276 --> 15:05.029
He has some kind of mystical hold on me.

15:05.112 --> 15:06.780
It was all his idea.

15:08.157 --> 15:10.576
Both of you, outside the van, now.

15:15.164 --> 15:17.166
Okay, I need a hint.

15:17.458 --> 15:21.211
A way to make something whiter
or fresher, anything.

15:23.839 --> 15:25.633
Come on, speak to me.

15:34.266 --> 15:36.393
<i>I still can't believe</i>

15:36.477 --> 15:38.437
Bobby cheated on his paper route.

15:38.520 --> 15:40.230
I don't even know how to punish that.

15:40.314 --> 15:43.525
Well, the pressures of journalism
can be very intense.

15:43.609 --> 15:44.860
Even I have felt it.

15:44.944 --> 15:47.780
But today, I really knocked one
out of the park.

15:47.863 --> 15:49.865
Good for you. What's the hint?

15:49.949 --> 15:51.325
Okay, get this.

15:51.408 --> 15:55.329
I combine two common items
in a powerful new way.

15:56.080 --> 15:57.498
I told my readers

15:57.581 --> 16:02.586
to harness the cleaning power of ammonia
with the whitening power of bleach.

16:02.670 --> 16:04.630
Ammonia and bleach?

16:04.713 --> 16:07.424
You told people to mix ammonia and bleach?

16:07.508 --> 16:10.761
Only if they want bathroom fixtures
that shine like the sun.

16:10.844 --> 16:13.430
Peggy, that's the recipe for mustard gas!

16:13.764 --> 16:17.142
Arlen will be covered
with a cloud of poison.

16:21.522 --> 16:22.356
Bobby, get up.

16:22.439 --> 16:25.818
-I'm up! The S in service stands for...
-Not now, Bobby.

16:25.901 --> 16:28.737
Don't worry.
Your mom screwed up this time, not you.

16:29.571 --> 16:30.406
All right.

16:30.489 --> 16:33.534
As long as we get the production plant
before they're done printing,

16:33.617 --> 16:35.035
everything'll be okay.

16:35.119 --> 16:37.246
Are you sure I'm making mustard gas?

16:37.329 --> 16:40.332
Yes! My dad used to mix up
a big batch of it

16:40.416 --> 16:42.042
to celebrate V-J day.

16:42.126 --> 16:46.338
Oh, God! If that article gets out,
I am going to be a laughingstock!

16:46.422 --> 16:49.258
Peggy, there may not be anyone left
to laugh.

16:49.341 --> 16:50.676
You really think so?

16:50.759 --> 16:52.886
Oh. I see. That's bad.

16:55.764 --> 16:57.057
Stop the presses!

16:58.267 --> 17:02.187
Okay, the presses are at the south county
production plant.

17:02.271 --> 17:05.607
This is where we insert the circulars
and <i>Parade</i> magazines.

17:05.691 --> 17:07.401
Where's today's paper?

17:07.484 --> 17:09.653
It'll be hitting the first vending boxes
and homes

17:09.737 --> 17:11.572
in about, uh, 20 minutes.

17:12.865 --> 17:15.284
I got the Lotto numbers
if that's what you're after.

17:17.995 --> 17:19.997
There's no way the three of us

17:20.080 --> 17:21.206
can collect every paper

17:21.290 --> 17:23.000
before somebody reads your hint.

17:23.375 --> 17:24.668
Jim Jones.

17:24.752 --> 17:27.713
Those guys with the purple sweats
and Peggy Hill.

17:28.255 --> 17:31.925
Hey, maybe there is a way
to pick up all the papers.

17:34.303 --> 17:35.387
Harv.

17:35.471 --> 17:36.722
I don't have time to explain,

17:36.805 --> 17:40.517
But I need your help picking up
every <i>Bystander</i> delivered this morning.

17:40.601 --> 17:41.852
Sorry.

17:41.935 --> 17:44.521
We ain't fit to be
in the newspaper biz no more.

17:44.605 --> 17:47.191
-We're in the pizza-flyer game now.
-Mm-hmm.

17:47.274 --> 17:48.650
Dang it, guys...

17:48.734 --> 17:50.778
...and possibly ma'am there.

17:50.861 --> 17:53.822
I know how you feel
taken for granted sometimes.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.199
But you're the invisible army

17:55.282 --> 17:58.410
that brings this town the answers
to the big questions.

17:58.494 --> 17:59.912
Should I wear a coat today?

17:59.995 --> 18:02.414
What will my son eat for school lunch?

18:02.498 --> 18:04.041
What time did the sun set?

18:04.958 --> 18:05.918
Sirs...

18:06.293 --> 18:11.423
the last few days of delivering papers,
I've seen things I've never seen before.

18:11.799 --> 18:12.966
The sunrise,

18:13.050 --> 18:16.178
morning dew, snails on sidewalks,

18:16.261 --> 18:17.554
things...

18:17.638 --> 18:20.265
I never want to see again.

18:20.349 --> 18:21.975
Please come back.

18:24.728 --> 18:25.896
If you do this,

18:25.979 --> 18:29.483
you will get to keep whatever
the paper's worth at the recycling center.

18:29.566 --> 18:30.776
Mm-hmm.

18:30.859 --> 18:32.986
Okay, we're in.
All right, let's go, people.

18:33.070 --> 18:34.571
Top off your to-go cups,

18:34.655 --> 18:37.533
and remember those
above-the-garage guest houses.

19:12.317 --> 19:15.112
-You think we got 'em all?
-We know our routes. We got them.

19:15.195 --> 19:18.157
Six tons of newspapers, 18 dollars.

19:18.240 --> 19:20.367
Yes!

19:21.201 --> 19:22.661
Well, now that Arlen's safe,

19:22.744 --> 19:25.873
what do you say we all stop
at the Waffle House for some waffles?

19:25.956 --> 19:28.000
You'd better drop me
at <i>The Bystander,</i> Hank.

19:28.083 --> 19:30.544
I owe my readers one last column.

19:30.627 --> 19:31.670
I almost killed them.

19:31.753 --> 19:33.755
And now I have to break their hearts.

19:35.299 --> 19:37.593
Peggy, have you seen
this morning's <i>Bystander?</i>

19:38.760 --> 19:39.595
No.

19:39.678 --> 19:40.679
Nobody has.

19:40.762 --> 19:43.056
<i>Channel Eighty-four</i> must have gotten tired
of being scooped

19:43.140 --> 19:44.183
and stolen them all.

19:44.266 --> 19:45.684
Well, that's not quite the case.

19:45.767 --> 19:46.852
I got to hand it to them.

19:46.935 --> 19:49.688
This is a real step up
from them toilet-papering my lawn.

19:49.771 --> 19:52.065
Hey! We should go tear down their antenna!

19:52.149 --> 19:53.859
Roddy Rae, wait.

19:54.151 --> 19:56.820
<i>Channel Eighty-four</i>
did not steal our papers.

19:57.404 --> 19:58.238
I did!

19:58.322 --> 20:01.283
I just wanted to write for the paper
so bad,

20:01.366 --> 20:03.660
I didn't care where I got my ideas.

20:03.744 --> 20:06.205
Of course, the mustard-gas one was mine.

20:06.288 --> 20:07.998
"In conclusion, I was so busy

20:08.081 --> 20:10.709
trying to figure out busy
how to remove the stains

20:10.792 --> 20:13.295
that I forgot about the people
who actually create them."

20:14.046 --> 20:17.549
Peggy, have you heard of a newspaper
called the <i>New York Times?</i>

20:17.633 --> 20:19.885
Apparently, they have
a very challenging puzzle.

20:19.968 --> 20:22.888
You think they get their facts straight
all the time? No way.

20:22.971 --> 20:26.225
Hell, half the time it seems like
they're making it up as they go along.

20:26.642 --> 20:28.227
I don't need you for facts, Peggy,

20:28.310 --> 20:29.728
we got a fact-checker for that.

20:29.811 --> 20:32.856
Actually, I guess I got to let her go
in light of this mustard-gas thing.

20:32.940 --> 20:36.193
But my point is
you got a nice, friendly style,

20:36.652 --> 20:39.655
And in this business,
well, that's worth more than facts.

20:39.738 --> 20:41.573
So, I'm not fired?

20:41.657 --> 20:43.533
From your "Household Hints" column, yes.

20:43.617 --> 20:45.494
But you got a way
of grabbing people's attention.

20:45.577 --> 20:46.620
I need that.

20:46.828 --> 20:49.665
I've been wanting to run this photo
since the county fair,

20:49.748 --> 20:52.125
but no one's come up
with a good caption yet.

20:52.209 --> 20:54.002
"Woman Skirts Disaster."

20:54.086 --> 20:55.295
Come on, give me a hard one.

20:56.213 --> 20:59.049
Uh, let's see... "Hat's Incredible."

20:59.383 --> 21:02.386
"Jeepers Sweepers." Oh...

21:02.469 --> 21:04.638
"Pink Ink Stinks Rink."

21:04.721 --> 21:07.349
Hm. Wait, give me a minute.
Give me a minute.

21:07.432 --> 21:09.393
Oh, "Hold the Mayor."

21:48.140 --> 21:50.726
-<i>Rad!</i>
