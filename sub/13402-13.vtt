They call it
a medically induced coma.

00:06.840 --> 00:08.535
She hasn't woken up
since the surgery.

00:08.540 --> 00:10.167
If somebody said
that you could try anything

00:10.170 --> 00:11.330
what would you do?

00:11.340 --> 00:13.001
- Start my own brand.
- Deal.

00:13.010 --> 00:14.602
[beeping]

00:14.610 --> 00:17.602
- Toby, how is Yvonne?
- Not good.

00:17.610 --> 00:20.147
Nicole's parents called me,
and they want me back up there.

Why, is something wrong?

00:21.350 --> 00:23.341
I'm doing a fundraiser
for my dad

00:23.350 --> 00:25.011
and I'd loye to wear
something new.

00:25.020 --> 00:26.908
This what gave
her palpitations.

00:26.920 --> 00:29.855
It's not mine. I designed this
when I was working for Claudia.

'What did you have to do
to get this piece?‘

00:45.640 --> 00:47.779
Jenna reduced her
to blackmailing a tenth grader.

00:47.780 --> 00:49.668
- 'This can't be just Jenna.‘
- Jenna had help.

00:49.680 --> 00:51.648
What about that Sydney
what's-her-face?

00:51.650 --> 00:53.345
- He wants us to play.
- /Vo, Em.

I don't hear anything.

01:46.070 --> 01:47.162
Why don't you just go
in the house?

01:47.170 --> 01:48.933
I can't. My mom and I..

01:48.940 --> 01:50.931
Look, I know
that this is just A.D.

01:50.940 --> 01:52.237
pressing on a raw nerve,
right?

01:52.240 --> 01:53.764
They're just taking the fact
that I'm some

01:53.780 --> 01:55.338
sort of Dickensian foundling

01:55.340 --> 01:57.376
but one of you needs
to take this.

01:57.380 --> 01:58.540
Or stick your fingers in my ears

01:58.550 --> 01:59.744
so that I can get
some freakin' sleep

01:59.750 --> 02:01.115
_ 'cause I've tried
literally everything.

02:01.120 --> 02:02.519
Oh, my God, that is so annoying.

02:02.520 --> 02:04.579
Why can't we just
lock it up in Ali's house?

02:04.590 --> 02:06.046
I mean, she's out of town
this weekend, right?

02:06.060 --> 02:07.345
That's a spectacular idea.

02:07.360 --> 02:09.112
Actually, kind of unspectacular.

02:09.130 --> 02:10.279
I mean, a crying baby is
the last thing

02:10.290 --> 02:12.019
Ali needs to hear
when she comes back.

02:12.030 --> 02:13.258
She's got a lot on her mind.

02:13.260 --> 02:15.125
Why'd she go away again?

02:15.130 --> 02:16.757
A-Ali has something
to deal with.

02:16.770 --> 02:17.919
'You know, paperwork.‘

02:17.930 --> 02:19.921
I guess there's lot of red tape
when you're trying

02:19.940 --> 02:21.191
to un—marry
a dead identity thief.

02:21.200 --> 02:22.895
Okay, officially,
he's still alive.

02:22.910 --> 02:26.038
Well, did she officially change
her last name yet? She should.

Alison Rollins sounds
like a mouthful of muffin.

02:28.580 --> 02:30.229
Ezra's still in New York, right?

02:31.480 --> 02:33.698
I-I'm not babysitting
this pillow by myself.

02:33.720 --> 02:36.143
Okay, well, our place is loud
enough already, Caleb snores.

02:36.150 --> 02:37.242
- No, he doesn't.
- Yes, he does.

02:37.250 --> 02:39.741
Oh, my God, someone please.

02:39.760 --> 02:41.557
A-are we still allowed
to think that maybe

02:41.560 --> 02:43.585
Mary Drake
is responsible for this?

02:43.590 --> 02:46.058
I mean, I know she's your birth
mother, and it's a sensitive--

02:46.060 --> 02:47.254
I don't think that this is her.

02:47.260 --> 02:48.852
Why would she want
to taunt me with this?

02:48.860 --> 02:50.259
Well, we could ask her

02:50.270 --> 02:52.761
if she wasn't hiding out
somewhere like a lying liar.

02:52.770 --> 02:53.828
[crying stops]

02:53.840 --> 02:55.796
Wait. Why did it stop?

02:57.940 --> 02:59.635
I don't know, and I don't care.

03:02.040 --> 03:03.234
Guys, I have to keep the phone.

[baby chuckling]

03:04.980 --> 03:06.572
It's my turn.

03:10.520 --> 03:13.080
Got a secret
can you keep It?

03:13.090 --> 03:15.581
Swear this one you'll save

03:15.590 --> 03:17.922
Better lock it
in your pocket

03:17.930 --> 03:20.649
Taking this one
to the grave

03:20.660 --> 03:22.594
If I show you then I know

03:22.600 --> 03:25.660
You won't tell what I said

03:25.670 --> 03:28.161
'Cause two can keep a secret

03:28.170 --> 03:31.264
If one of them is dead

03:32.940 --> 03:34.259
You didn't sleep either?

03:34.280 --> 03:35.531
No, I've been waiting
for that phone

03:35.540 --> 03:37.098
to start screeching again.

03:37.110 --> 03:39.340
Well, did you hide it?
If Caleb finds it..

03:39.350 --> 03:42.547
No, I put it in my purse.
He's not gonna find it.

03:42.550 --> 03:44.609
What, guys aren't gonna go
through a girl's purse

03:44.620 --> 03:46.713
because they're too afraid
to accidently touch a tampon.

03:46.720 --> 03:49.553
[exhales forcefully]
Okay, well, how long are we
gonna keep this game a secret?

03:49.560 --> 03:52.552
I mean, A.D. practically dragged
Paige into the middle of it..

03:52.560 --> 03:54.221
Uh, so, Mona wasn't kidding
when she said

03:54.230 --> 03:56.050
she'll get you
in the "Style" section.

03:56.070 --> 03:57.799
You're on page one.

Well, you have to be
proud of Mona too.

- Oh, hey.

Sorry, I've been meaning
to come by.

to go, but..

05:17.780 --> 05:20.647
- That's really good news.
- It is.

05:20.650 --> 05:23.369
Actually, I was just reading
about certain drug therapies

05:23.390 --> 05:25.847
that have proven successful
in cases like hers.

05:25.850 --> 05:27.078
Uh, antidepressants

05:27.090 --> 05:29.081
uh, stimulants,
dopamine agonist.

05:29.090 --> 05:31.115
Yeah, I know, the-the
specialists have mentioned

05:31.130 --> 05:33.121
a few of those things, but, hey,
I-I don't mean to cut this short

05:33.130 --> 05:34.381
but I do need to get back
to the hospital.

05:34.400 --> 05:35.424
Sure. Absolutely.

05:35.430 --> 05:36.454
But it's good to see you.

05:36.470 --> 05:38.324
- Hey.
- Hi.

05:39.870 --> 05:42.464
Toby, it's really good
to see you up on your feet.

05:42.470 --> 05:43.664
You know,
we're all pulling for her.

05:43.670 --> 05:46.332
Thanks. Um, if you'll excuse me.

05:52.080 --> 05:54.139
Do you go for the fancy stuff?

05:54.150 --> 05:55.811
No, I prefer full-strength.

05:55.820 --> 05:57.173
Thought so.

05:57.190 --> 05:59.442
Excuse me, two coffees, black.

06:02.260 --> 06:04.148
So, uh..

06:04.160 --> 06:05.821
I hadn't heard back from you.

06:05.830 --> 06:07.525
Uh, my buddy in Jersey,
he's really good

06:07.530 --> 06:08.997
at finding people
who don't wanna be found.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.854
- Did you get my message?
- I did.

06:10.870 --> 06:13.088
Um...but

06:13.100 --> 06:15.068
I just think
maybe not right now.

06:15.070 --> 06:18.961
1-1 have to focus on people
in my life who are...missing.

06:21.180 --> 06:23.068
Would that include me?

06:25.150 --> 06:27.004
What are you doing today?

06:27.020 --> 06:29.318
I was just gonna send out
some resumes.

06:29.320 --> 06:30.844
Come with me.

06:30.850 --> 06:33.546
- Where?
- Come with me and find out.

06:33.560 --> 06:35.653
It's the weekend,
I actually have the day off.

06:35.660 --> 06:38.288
And a little activity
might be good for your shoulder.

06:38.290 --> 06:39.655
And it might help you
get your mind off

06:39.660 --> 06:41.753
of everything that's been
twistin' you up lately.

06:43.070 --> 06:44.219
That does sound really nice.

06:44.230 --> 06:46.221
You'd actually be
doing me a favor.

06:46.240 --> 06:47.969
And get that frown
off your face.

06:47.970 --> 06:49.562
Might make me feel better
about not finding

06:49.570 --> 06:50.867
the person who shot you.

06:54.980 --> 06:57.676
Actually, could we get those
two coffees to go, please?

06:57.680 --> 06:58.874
Thanks.

07:01.680 --> 07:05.480
Can you conﬁrm that
with the front desk? Uh-huh.

07:05.490 --> 07:07.583
No names were mentioned,
but the scoop came

07:07.590 --> 07:08.750
from an anonymous source.

07:08.760 --> 07:10.284
You can't spell anonymous
without A.D.

07:10.290 --> 07:12.986
Well, technically,
there's no 'D' in anonymous

07:13.000 --> 07:14.649
but, whatever.
I get your point.

07:14.660 --> 07:16.059
Are you sure that it's legit?

07:16.060 --> 07:17.049
The post has been re-blogged

07:17.070 --> 07:19.698
at least 500 times
in the last half hour.

07:19.700 --> 07:21.691
I mean, what if Claudia Greco
actually reads it.

07:21.700 --> 07:23.497
The story makes it sounds
like I stole from her.

07:23.510 --> 07:25.239
Hanna, are you sure
that this isn't

07:25.240 --> 07:28.232
just some blogger trying
to drum up hits with gossip?

07:28.240 --> 07:29.537
"Blind item, blind girl."

07:29.550 --> 07:31.302
The post probably came
from Jenna.

07:31.310 --> 07:32.504
First, her and bodyguards

07:32.510 --> 07:33.772
try to ruin my face
at the cobbler shop

07:33.780 --> 07:35.509
and now they're trying
to ruin my career.

07:35.520 --> 07:37.442
So Jenna checked out
of the Radley late last night.

07:37.450 --> 07:39.418
- We have to find her.
- We will, Hanna.

07:39.420 --> 07:41.183
And I thinkI know
how we do that.

07:41.190 --> 07:42.452
Sydney.. What's her name?

07:42.460 --> 07:45.224
- Uh, Driscoll, I think.
- Whatever.

07:45.230 --> 07:46.629
Sydney helped Jenna get past us

07:46.630 --> 07:48.052
and got her to the blind school.

07:48.060 --> 07:49.152
She can lead us to Jenna.

07:49.160 --> 07:50.798
And before Jenna
makes me roll the dice

07:50.800 --> 07:53.189
and gamble away my future.

07:53.200 --> 07:54.895
Wait, what? What dice?

07:54.900 --> 07:57.095
Figure of speech.
What's the plan?

07:57.110 --> 07:59.362
Well, my guess is
they're in communication.

07:59.370 --> 08:01.133
So we use Sydney
to track down Jenna.

08:01.140 --> 08:03.301
And how do we do that?
Just say "Pretty, please

08:03.310 --> 08:04.629
tell us where Jenna went?"

08:04.650 --> 08:06.208
Well, if I run you through
some Bluesnarf basics

08:06.220 --> 08:08.518
we can get what we need
through Sydney's cellphone.

08:11.390 --> 08:13.847
Um, let's start
with the simple stuff.

08:14.760 --> 08:16.489
'Pen with a listening device.‘

08:16.490 --> 08:17.809
'Oh, and now this thing is..'

08:17.830 --> 08:21.493
I know it sounds obvious,
but love and..

08:22.460 --> 08:24.553
imagining seeing Ezra again.

08:25.670 --> 08:26.921
'Being able to focus on him

08:26.940 --> 08:28.828
'really got me tethered
to something real..'

08:28.840 --> 08:30.296
Aria?

08:30.310 --> 08:31.834
(Nicole)
'Just knowing that out there
in the world..'

08:31.840 --> 08:34.161
Hey, if you
wanna watch that, we can..

08:34.180 --> 08:35.602
No.

08:35.610 --> 08:37.373
No, I don't.

08:37.380 --> 08:39.974
Just another reminder
that there's nothing I can do

08:39.980 --> 08:42.369
until Ezra's done helping her.

08:42.380 --> 08:44.268
Obviously, she still needs him.

08:46.120 --> 08:49.248
Uh, guys, please
don't give me the sad eyes.

08:50.690 --> 08:52.351
You two found your way
back to each other.

08:52.360 --> 08:54.555
Ezra and I will too.

08:55.260 --> 08:56.898
[monitor beeping]

08:58.470 --> 09:01.667
[instrumental music]

09:08.340 --> 09:10.171
Has she said anything?

09:10.180 --> 09:12.705
Sometimes she smiles at me
when she sees me

09:12.710 --> 09:15.247
but she hasn't spoken yet.

09:18.720 --> 09:20.142
After the accident I had

09:20.160 --> 09:22.458
when _I was still
in the police academy

09:22.460 --> 09:25.452
I remember waking up
in a hospital.

09:25.460 --> 09:27.655
Not knowing where I was
at first..

09:27.660 --> 09:29.821
...or if anybody even knew
how to find me.

09:32.800 --> 09:35.166
I know she feels like that,
but she can't tell me.

09:37.170 --> 09:39.104
(Yvonne)
'Toby.‘

09:40.010 --> 09:41.409
Hey.

09:41.410 --> 09:43.037
I'm here.

09:43.050 --> 09:44.301
Would you mind getting
the nurse?

09:44.310 --> 09:46.005
Sure.

09:48.380 --> 09:51.349
I just wanna grab a couple more
GPS trackers, we'll head out.

09:51.350 --> 09:52.647
Alright, well, hurry
because Aria

09:52.650 --> 09:54.618
already has a lead on Sydney.

09:56.090 --> 09:57.182
[sighs]

09:57.190 --> 09:59.226

10:11.610 --> 10:13.259
[drumroll]

10:17.680 --> 10:19.500
(Caleb)
'Hanna, have you seen
my other gear bag?‘

10:19.510 --> 10:21.205
'The, uh, green backpack.‘

10:22.480 --> 10:24.619
[banging]

10:25.250 --> 10:26.808
Hanna?

10:28.890 --> 10:30.983
Who is banging on the door?

10:36.100 --> 10:37.829
What is it?

10:39.470 --> 10:40.789
It's you.

10:43.110 --> 10:46.102
[dramatic music]

10:56.620 --> 10:57.939
You mean, you guys have been
sitting on this--

10:57.950 --> 10:59.383
The game showed up
a couple of days

10:59.390 --> 11:00.812
after the blind school.

11:00.820 --> 11:02.651
We've been hiding it
at Spencer's.

11:02.660 --> 11:03.911
I'm sorry.

11:03.930 --> 11:05.488
We should have told you sooner.

11:05.490 --> 11:07.082
And there's a phone?

11:07.100 --> 11:09.455
Henna, phones have cameras.

11:09.460 --> 11:11.018
They can watch, they can listen.

11:11.030 --> 11:12.998
I know, okay.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.298
So far, it only tells us
whose turn it is.

11:15.300 --> 11:16.335
What? like "Simon Says?"

11:16.340 --> 11:18.808
Yeah. Kind of...but meaner.

11:21.010 --> 11:23.308
You really thought that was me?

11:23.310 --> 11:25.642
Well, I got a little aggro
when we found out it was a doll.

11:25.650 --> 11:28.107
That's why its face
is all messed up.

11:28.120 --> 11:29.576
It talks too.

11:29.580 --> 11:31.616
- I don't wanna hear it.
- We have to.

11:31.620 --> 11:32.814
If this is part of A.D.'s game

11:32.820 --> 11:34.708
it probably
has something to say.

11:36.790 --> 11:40.157
[automated message]
'For more information,
please see the appendix.‘

11:40.160 --> 11:42.822
"Please see the appendix."
W-what does that mean?

11:42.830 --> 11:45.025
There's no instruction manual
or rule book.

11:45.030 --> 11:48.329
Well, if it was on the phone,
we haven't been able to find it.

11:48.340 --> 11:51.935
Maybe I should take a look
at the game board.

11:51.940 --> 11:53.430
Well, there's these
little pieces that look

11:53.440 --> 11:54.805
like the five of us.

11:54.810 --> 11:56.300
If you're not on the board
I don't think

11:56.310 --> 11:57.334
you're invited to play.

11:57.350 --> 11:58.544
I'm not trying to get in on it

11:58.550 --> 12:00.108
I'm trying to get inside of it.

12:00.120 --> 12:01.439
If I can figure out how it works

12:01.450 --> 12:02.474
maybe I can find out
who made it.

12:02.480 --> 12:04.311
Can you just turn it around?

12:04.320 --> 12:05.981
I don't wanna look
at It anymore.

12:08.520 --> 12:10.215
(Spencer)
'Thanks.‘

12:10.960 --> 12:13.849
[indistinct chattering]

12:14.860 --> 12:16.350
This is where we're going?

12:16.360 --> 12:19.261
I thought we might engage
in some recreation, yes.

12:21.570 --> 12:23.037
How do you feel..

12:24.270 --> 12:25.908
...about ping-pong?

12:25.910 --> 12:28.037
Oh, that's the plan.

12:28.040 --> 12:30.008
We're gonna volunteer
for a few hours

12:30.010 --> 12:31.875
work with some kids

12:31.880 --> 12:34.178
take my mind off of my troubles.

12:34.180 --> 12:35.909
'Are you always this cynical
when someone tries'

12:35.920 --> 12:37.478
to do something nice for you?

12:37.490 --> 12:38.514
I'm sorry.

12:38.520 --> 12:40.818
Um, let me try this again.

12:40.820 --> 12:41.980
Ping-pong.

12:41.990 --> 12:44.754
I feel great about ping-pong.

12:44.760 --> 12:46.853
- Much better.
- Good.

12:46.860 --> 12:48.350
But why here?

12:48.360 --> 12:50.999
Called ahead,
had a buddy reserve the room.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.490
Got the place to ourselves.

12:53.740 --> 12:56.834
Did you move senior Zumba
for me?

12:57.840 --> 12:59.603
That is so thoughtful.

12:59.610 --> 13:00.668
[chuckles]

13:00.680 --> 13:01.772
[beeping]

13:01.780 --> 13:03.509
Can you pick it up?

13:05.610 --> 13:07.009
What if I can't?

13:07.020 --> 13:09.113
This is just a simple test.

13:09.120 --> 13:10.815
Just to see where you're at.

13:14.060 --> 13:16.153
We won't know until you try.

13:26.170 --> 13:27.626
Good.

13:27.640 --> 13:30.529
Okay now,
put it in your left hand

13:30.540 --> 13:32.428
give it a good squeeze.

13:44.490 --> 13:46.879
Okay. One more.

13:46.890 --> 13:48.585
This one's for me, though..

13:49.760 --> 13:51.352
...not the doctors.

13:56.400 --> 14:00.166
I-I've been waiting for days.
I don't wanna wait anymore.

14:00.170 --> 14:03.367
I think we should do it.
Today. Right now.

14:06.510 --> 14:07.829
What do you say?

14:14.680 --> 14:16.147
I say..

14:20.520 --> 14:22.056
...I do.

14:29.500 --> 14:31.695
(Lucas)
'Apparently, one of the
daughters of the investors'

14:31.700 --> 14:33.122
'follows "Runway Rebel."'

14:33.130 --> 14:35.189
They know that Claudia Greco
was on your resume

14:35.200 --> 14:37.191
and it wasn't hard
to make the leap.

14:37.210 --> 14:39.804
So now, it's not just casual
drink. It's the inquisition.

14:39.810 --> 14:42.973
Look, I don't want you
getting nervous, okay?

14:42.980 --> 14:44.436
They just need some reassurance.

14:44.450 --> 14:46.145
'I'll walk them through
the numbers and then'

14:46.150 --> 14:47.572
you just dazzle them
with your designs.

14:47.580 --> 14:49.878
Okay, you know what?
Say this doesn't go well.

14:49.890 --> 14:51.881
What if Claudia Greco
actually has the grounds

14:51.890 --> 14:53.642
to sue me for taking
some of her ideas?

14:53.660 --> 14:54.888
- Wait, does she?
- 'No.‘

14:54.890 --> 14:57.518
I'm just saying, hypothetically.

14:57.530 --> 15:00.328
Well, then the investors
would probably pull out.

15:00.330 --> 15:02.855
Look, they wanna invest
in clothes, not court fees.

15:02.860 --> 15:04.054
And that's the worst?

15:04.070 --> 15:05.423
Hanna, I don't want you
worrying about--

15:05.430 --> 15:07.068
Lucas, I have to know
what the stakes are.

15:07.070 --> 15:09.789
My company can absorb
the loss, Hanna.

15:09.800 --> 15:12.234
'There's a thousand ways
that I could write this off.‘

15:12.240 --> 15:14.367
And besides, I would not
have invested in you

15:14.380 --> 15:16.678
_ unless _I believed
In a posrtlve outcome.

15:16.680 --> 15:19.444
Hey. Y-you know what might help?

15:19.450 --> 15:20.872
Visual aids.

15:20.880 --> 15:23.348
Sketches.
Maybe a few finished pieces.

15:23.350 --> 15:24.544
- Do you mind if I take a look?
- No.

15:24.550 --> 15:27.041
No. That's just
a half naked dress form.

15:27.060 --> 15:28.857
This piece is not finished yet.

15:28.860 --> 15:31.055
Come on, just a peek
for your silent partner.

15:31.060 --> 15:34.086
Lucas, no. Not yet.

15:34.100 --> 15:37.695
Just give me the afternoon
to put something together.

15:37.700 --> 15:40.089
Okay. Fine.

15:40.100 --> 15:41.362
I'll see you tonight.

15:41.370 --> 15:43.258
Lobby at the Radley
at 7:00, okay?

15:43.270 --> 15:44.965
On the dot.

[door closes]

15:52.380 --> 15:54.302
[beeping]

15:56.620 --> 15:58.781
Sydney graduated from Berkeley.

15:58.790 --> 16:01.281
Double major in economics
and French.

16:01.290 --> 16:03.417
She studied abroad
her junior year.

16:07.400 --> 16:10.028
That's some pretty spendy
real estate.

16:10.030 --> 16:11.122
She's a bank teller?

16:11.130 --> 16:12.859
Well, private client banking.

16:12.870 --> 16:15.464
Her department services people
with a lot of money.

16:15.470 --> 16:17.097
Like a lot, a lot.

16:17.110 --> 16:18.589
She checked into a charity gala

16:18.610 --> 16:22.899
for the Manhattan Children's
Hospital two days ago.

16:22.910 --> 16:24.138
Didn't the Congressman's
daughter

16:24.150 --> 16:25.503
wear Hanna's dress to that?

16:25.510 --> 16:28.343
Senator's daughter.

16:33.090 --> 16:35.479
There, look. In the corner.

16:36.620 --> 16:38.781
Looks like we just found
the "Runway Rebel's"

16:38.790 --> 16:39.984
anonymous source.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.319
Well, if Sydney weaseled her way

16:41.330 --> 16:42.627
into a charity ball
in New York

16:42.630 --> 16:44.257
what else has she done
for Jenna?

16:44.270 --> 16:45.726
The police said
it was a different gun

16:45.730 --> 16:47.960
that shot Spencer, right?

16:49.995 --> 16:50.010
Maybe the confession
Jenna gave to the police

16:50.010 --> 16:51.534
was to protect
the other shooter.

16:52.010 --> 16:53.500
Sydney.

16:56.240 --> 16:57.969
'And I bet her aim was
a hell of a lot better'

16:57.980 --> 16:59.299
than Jenna's.

16:59.310 --> 17:00.777
We should be careful.

17:00.780 --> 17:02.338
No, we're not gonna confront her

17:02.350 --> 17:04.739
just gonna get some answers.

17:07.660 --> 17:08.718
I've looked in the appendix

17:08.720 --> 17:11.553
of every book
in this loft, nothing.

17:11.560 --> 17:13.187
(Caleb)
'Well, what did you
expect to find?'

17:13.190 --> 17:15.829
Something, a note,
a clue, a pipe bomb.

17:15.830 --> 17:17.195
'How's it going on your end?‘

17:17.200 --> 17:18.861
So you guys never used
an on or off switch?

17:18.870 --> 17:20.622
Never had to plug this thing in?

17:20.640 --> 17:23.438
(Hanna)
'If it was that simple,
we would've cut the cord.‘

17:23.440 --> 17:26.307
This game just does things.

17:26.310 --> 17:27.766
Do you think
there's batteries inside?

17:27.780 --> 17:29.202
'Maybe.‘

17:29.210 --> 17:30.802
'I mean, there's like
12 different types of batteries'

17:30.810 --> 17:32.698
'that could power
something like this.‘

17:32.710 --> 17:34.143
I could trace
where they were bought

17:34.150 --> 17:35.913
maybe get an ID
on A.D. that way.

17:35.920 --> 17:38.480
'But I-I can't even figure out
how to get inside this thing.‘

17:38.490 --> 17:39.912
'I even tried sticking
little tweezers'

17:39.920 --> 17:42.309
'in that slot in the side,
but it won't open.‘

17:43.190 --> 17:45.522
- Did you say tweezers?
- Yeah.

17:45.530 --> 17:47.179
(Hanna)
'Okay, do you remember
that game'

17:47.200 --> 17:49.589
'where the guy had
the big, red light-up nose?‘

17:49.600 --> 17:51.420
Um, "Operation?"

17:54.870 --> 17:59.000
I figured out which appendix
we're talking about.

17:59.010 --> 18:00.830
A.D. wants me to cut
this thing open.

18:02.510 --> 18:05.502
[dramatic music]

18:37.380 --> 18:40.440
(Furey)
'Ten all, your service.‘

18:40.450 --> 18:42.338
Alright, you're good.
Are you holding back?

18:42.350 --> 18:43.942
- Maybe a little.
- Don't.

18:43.950 --> 18:45.645
You sure?

18:49.120 --> 18:50.280
[chuckles]

18:50.290 --> 18:52.929
Eleven-ten. One more and I win.

18:52.930 --> 18:54.386
Where did you learn how to play?

18:54.400 --> 18:56.356
Horseback riding camp.

18:56.360 --> 18:58.828
We couldn't run the jumping
course when it rained so..

18:58.830 --> 19:01.663
I was ping-pong champ
for five consecutive summers.

19:01.670 --> 19:02.568
At an all girls camp.

19:02.570 --> 19:05.232
Uh, yeah,
same one my mom went to.

19:06.310 --> 19:08.528
My adopted mom.

19:08.540 --> 19:09.837
Well, you know,
I actually learned

19:09.840 --> 19:11.876
how to play on this table.
Right here.

19:11.880 --> 19:13.199
Oh, home court advantage.

19:13.210 --> 19:15.576
Well, the neighborhood was
a little rougher then.

19:15.580 --> 19:17.548
- We ponged hard.
-Hmm.

19:17.550 --> 19:19.882
- You scared?
- Got a few tricks up my sleeve.

19:22.320 --> 19:23.912
Game point.

19:27.960 --> 19:31.259
Ho-ho, that's game.

19:32.130 --> 19:33.825
That's impressive.

19:38.110 --> 19:39.509
Thank you.

19:39.510 --> 19:41.159
Seriously, I needed this.

19:41.180 --> 19:42.329
I needed to win..

19:42.340 --> 19:44.103
...on an existential level.

19:44.110 --> 19:46.374
Oh, come on.
I'm the real winner here.

19:47.080 --> 19:48.911
Ping-pong..

19:50.920 --> 19:52.945
Beats the hell out of spending
the weekend at my desk.

19:54.320 --> 19:56.015
I keep poring over
the forensic files

19:56.020 --> 19:57.351
from blind school.

19:57.360 --> 19:59.089
I still just can't figure out
how we could miss

19:59.090 --> 20:01.024
the second firearm.

20:01.030 --> 20:03.248
The brass is all bent
out of shape

20:03.260 --> 20:05.296
because the Rollins' case
IS still open.

20:08.640 --> 20:09.789
I'm sorry.

20:09.800 --> 20:12.360
No, you needed a win,
I needed a break.

20:13.040 --> 20:15.258
End of work discussion.

20:15.280 --> 20:17.532
What do you think?
Best four out of seven?

20:17.550 --> 20:19.541
Give you a chance
to make a comeback.

20:19.550 --> 20:22.348
- What?
- Your shoulder.

20:22.350 --> 20:24.511
I gonna see if I can find
a first-aid kit.

20:30.890 --> 20:33.882
[instrumental music]

20:47.680 --> 20:49.739
[phone buzzing]

20:57.590 --> 21:00.343
[sighs]
Spencer's not picking up
for me, either.

21:00.360 --> 21:03.557
There's a good chance
Sydney's using her office Wi-Fi.

21:03.560 --> 21:06.154
If the connection's open
I can hack her phone.

21:06.160 --> 21:07.718
You'll need this.

21:07.730 --> 21:10.597
And I just carry this
in my purse, whatever this is?

21:10.600 --> 21:12.818
A femtocell with some mods
that Caleb added.

21:12.830 --> 21:15.298
You will need to stay close
and keep her talking long enough

21:15.300 --> 21:16.733
so I can dig around.

21:16.740 --> 21:19.834
And I will throughput
all of her data to this device.

21:19.840 --> 21:23.037
Calendars, contacts,
voicemails, emails, texts--

21:23.040 --> 21:24.268
How do you know all this?

21:24.280 --> 21:26.248
Caleb taught me, this morning.

21:26.250 --> 21:27.672
You, using jargon

21:27.680 --> 21:29.443
the same girl
who accidently had her phone

21:29.450 --> 21:31.077
on airplane mode
for half of the ninth grade.

21:31.090 --> 21:32.546
I catch on fast.

21:32.550 --> 21:33.744
We need to find Jenna.

21:33.760 --> 21:35.182
Yeah, and find out
whether or not

21:35.190 --> 21:36.817
she's buying Sydney's bullets.

21:40.630 --> 21:42.791
[sighs]
Here goes nothing.

21:42.800 --> 21:44.392
Good luck.

21:46.830 --> 21:47.922
[car door closes]

21:52.070 --> 21:54.265
- 'It's short.‘
- I know.

21:54.280 --> 21:55.633
No, like really short, like

21:55.640 --> 21:57.631
"everyone's gonna see her
spicy tuna-roll" short--

21:57.650 --> 21:59.402
Okay, that's not even
the worst part.

21:59.410 --> 22:00.604
The investors are from Japan.

22:00.620 --> 22:02.576
They're gonna be
completely offended.

22:02.580 --> 22:04.241
I mean, t-this is the game.

22:04.250 --> 22:07.640
I blow that meeting, and then
A.D. makes the story go away.

22:07.660 --> 22:10.652
Meanwhile, the dress
pisses off the investors

22:10.660 --> 22:12.855
you lose the business,
and Lucas loses a lot of money.

22:13.900 --> 22:15.697
Yeah, and it'll all be
my fault.

22:18.330 --> 22:20.798
[sighs]

22:20.800 --> 22:23.667
Yesterday, I was so excited
for this meeting.

22:25.440 --> 22:29.035
I was gonna breeze in there
and be the boss.

22:29.040 --> 22:32.703
I was gonna be impressive
and creative and confident.

22:35.320 --> 22:37.538
People don't always
see me that way.

22:45.460 --> 22:48.156
What happens
if you just say screw it

22:48.160 --> 22:49.525
and you refuse to play?

22:49.530 --> 22:51.953
You flip the board over
and you storm out?

22:57.710 --> 23:00.133
A.D. knows about Rollins,
and you could go to jail.

23:03.210 --> 23:05.371
Can you just
stop this thing..

23:05.980 --> 23:07.470
...before tonight?

23:10.050 --> 23:11.574
I can try.

23:15.620 --> 23:18.817
[indistinct chatter]

23:23.730 --> 23:24.754
Sydney?

23:25.870 --> 23:28.623
What's it been,
like, five years?

23:28.640 --> 23:30.039
Are we really
gonna do this whole

23:30.040 --> 23:31.359
"What a coincidence" thing?

23:31.370 --> 23:33.099
Who sent you, Caleb or Mona?

23:33.110 --> 23:35.408
Doesn't matter.
I'm here about Jenna.

23:35.410 --> 23:36.832
Can we talk?

23:42.550 --> 23:45.713
Honestly, I'm glad it's you
that's poking around.

23:45.720 --> 23:46.880
After everything
that went down

23:46.890 --> 23:48.744
I thought I'd be hearing
from the cops.

23:48.760 --> 23:50.580
Because someone got shot?

23:50.590 --> 23:52.854
I was nowhere near there.
I was at the Radley Hotel.

23:52.860 --> 23:54.589
All I did was deliver
a couple of drinks

23:54.600 --> 23:56.227
to Caleb and Mona
With a message.

23:56.230 --> 23:57.595
Why?

23:58.730 --> 24:01.290
Jenny sold it
as a practical joke.

24:01.300 --> 24:02.437
I was up in Rosewood

24:02.440 --> 24:04.089
having brunch
with my parents anyway

24:04.110 --> 24:05.532
and it seemed harmless enough.

24:05.540 --> 24:07.269
Yeah, until Noel Kahn
ended up dead

24:07.280 --> 24:08.929
and Spencer ended up
in the hospital.

24:10.110 --> 24:11.634
And here we are.

24:14.920 --> 24:17.047
After high school,
Jenna and I drifted apart

24:17.050 --> 24:19.041
and I wish
I would have left it that way.

24:19.050 --> 24:21.610
Trust me, that's the last favor
I'll ever do for her.

24:23.420 --> 24:24.910
Can I ask you a question?

24:26.460 --> 24:27.950
Sure.

24:29.460 --> 24:30.927
I know there's
a lot of bad blood

24:30.930 --> 24:32.921
between you and your friends
and Jenna.

24:34.600 --> 24:36.090
I answered a phone call
from an old friend

24:36.100 --> 24:38.193
and got sucked into a lot
of high school drama.

24:40.240 --> 24:42.060
What's your excuse?

24:49.450 --> 24:53.079
Um, well, I have a conference
that goes all afternoon, so..

25:04.670 --> 25:06.467
Sydney's got an appointment

25:06.470 --> 25:08.165
in her calendar for later today.

25:08.170 --> 25:10.035
"Vogel Vision Institute."

25:11.040 --> 25:12.268
Then she lied to me.

25:12.270 --> 25:14.500
I mean, is she taking Jenna
to the eye doctor?

25:14.510 --> 25:15.875
Another favor?

25:17.080 --> 25:19.105
I say we get there first
and find out.

25:24.050 --> 25:25.847
[device beeping]

25:32.630 --> 25:34.450
[device whirring]

25:34.460 --> 25:36.553
- Is it working?
- Yeah.

25:39.870 --> 25:40.962
(Sydney)
'I'm just dropping off
the deposit'

25:40.970 --> 25:42.392
'for a surgical procedure.‘

25:42.400 --> 25:45.233
- 'Patient name?‘
- 'Marshal. Jenna Marshal.‘

25:45.240 --> 25:46.468
(female #2)
'While you're here,
would you like'

25:46.470 --> 25:47.539
'to schedule your procedure?‘

25:47.540 --> 25:49.007
'I'm not Jenna. Like I said'

25:49.010 --> 25:51.399
- 'I'm just here to drop off..'
- Jenna's not in there.

25:51.410 --> 25:53.640
(female #2)
'I'll run this back to billing
and get you a receipt.‘

25:53.650 --> 25:55.675
(Sydney)
'No need. Have a nice day.‘

25:55.680 --> 25:57.409
Someone's buying Jenna
a new pair of eyes?

25:57.420 --> 25:59.149
(female #2)
'Whom should I say
made the deposit?‘

25:59.150 --> 26:01.641
(Sydney)
'Just write down
the initials, A.D.'

26:01.660 --> 26:03.855
- 'A.D.?' .
- 'For anonymous donor.

26:03.860 --> 26:06.328
'Should be easy enough
to remember, right?‘

26:06.330 --> 26:08.389
AD. is paying Jenna off.

26:08.400 --> 26:09.822
She got us all
at the blind school

26:09.830 --> 26:13.561
and now in return she gets
her eyesight back...again.

26:13.570 --> 26:16.095
Is Sydney AD.
or is she just another pawn?

26:17.310 --> 26:19.665
Do you think that Jenna
orchestrated the whole thing

26:19.670 --> 26:21.763
so that AD. could take
a shot at Spencer?

26:23.840 --> 26:25.944
Wait, Sydney's phone is
in range.

26:27.280 --> 26:30.613
- I'm picking up a text.
- What's it say? Who's it from?

26:30.620 --> 26:32.884
(Aria)
"Did you do it?"
It's from a blocked number.

26:34.520 --> 26:35.953
There she is.

26:39.530 --> 26:41.259
"It's done."

26:45.470 --> 26:48.769
Your hands are a lot bigger
than when you were a kid.

26:48.770 --> 26:50.635
They're lot less purple too.

26:52.670 --> 26:54.331
I can see why she wants
to leave it up.

26:57.280 --> 26:59.578
It's been there for years.

26:59.580 --> 27:01.707
They left it that way
after Gloriana passed.

27:03.080 --> 27:04.616
I'm sorry.

27:05.450 --> 27:07.088
Was she special to you?

27:07.090 --> 27:09.115
Well, she ran this place
for decades.

27:10.460 --> 27:12.519
She was special.

27:12.530 --> 27:15.385
To everyone who walked
through that door.

27:15.400 --> 27:17.721
Including a shy kid
with glasses.

27:17.730 --> 27:20.767
Hmm. I can't really
picture you as shy.

27:20.770 --> 27:22.931
And chubby. Just a little bit.

27:22.940 --> 27:24.692
[chuckles]
Wha..

27:26.070 --> 27:27.867
She always had a smile
and a hug for me

27:27.880 --> 27:29.165
after our day at school.

27:30.880 --> 27:32.848
Not a lot of hugs at home.

27:33.980 --> 27:36.847
My mother had some problems.

27:38.320 --> 27:39.685
Prescription pills.

27:40.790 --> 27:42.417
They can be really hard.

27:44.190 --> 27:45.748
Is your mother..

27:47.760 --> 27:50.797
- Oh, she's clean now.
- Great.

27:50.800 --> 27:52.825
We talk once a month
on the phone.

27:52.830 --> 27:54.297
It works for the both of us.

27:56.470 --> 27:58.791
Here you go. All done.

28:00.240 --> 28:01.400
Thank you.

28:01.410 --> 28:04.004
Let's get you home.
Put some ice on that shoulder.

28:10.450 --> 28:13.715
Oh, man, do we
have to go back right now?

28:15.460 --> 28:16.859
We can stay as long
as you want.

28:22.230 --> 28:23.857
So beautiful.

28:26.800 --> 28:29.268
[chuckles]

28:29.270 --> 28:32.091
I've been so caught up
in my own soap opera lately

28:32.110 --> 28:33.759
I forgot that I'm not
the first person

28:33.770 --> 28:35.203
to have a complicated story

28:35.210 --> 28:36.029
about a birth mother

28:36.040 --> 28:37.530
and a surrogate mother.

28:37.550 --> 28:40.178
[chuckles]

28:40.180 --> 28:42.341
You don't have
to drIve yourself crazy

28:42.350 --> 28:43.749
choosing between the two.

28:45.350 --> 28:47.113
All you have to do is..

28:47.120 --> 28:49.145
...love the people
that want the best for you.

28:50.560 --> 28:53.757
[instrumental music]

29:24.160 --> 29:25.616
Hey, Sydney, got a minute?

29:25.630 --> 29:28.929
- Did you follow me?
- I had to, you lied to me.

29:28.930 --> 29:30.557
Here's what's gonna happen.

29:30.560 --> 29:31.697
We're gonna take
a nice little drive

29:31.700 --> 29:33.065
to go visit your friend Jenna.

29:33.070 --> 29:34.719
And on the way there,
you're gonna tell us

29:34.740 --> 29:38.494
about how the two of you know
someone with the initials A.D.

29:38.510 --> 29:40.102
I'm not going anywhere with you.

29:40.110 --> 29:42.203
Well, if you walk away,
we'll just keep showing up.

29:42.210 --> 29:45.179
Yoga at Ludlow Street, drinks
with your friends at 9 PM.

29:45.180 --> 29:47.478
You wouldn't want that now,
would you?

29:47.480 --> 29:49.368
This is insane. How do you
even know my schedule?

29:49.380 --> 29:51.974
I'm done talking now.
So let's go. Move it.

29:53.120 --> 29:55.509
[screams]
Let go of me.

29:55.520 --> 29:56.589
Let her go.

29:56.590 --> 29:57.955
Tell us what you know about A.D.

29:57.960 --> 29:59.109
and we'll get out of your hair.

29:59.130 --> 30:00.654
Tell your Chihuahua
to keep her paws

30:00.660 --> 30:01.888
to herself
and maybe I'll talk.

30:01.900 --> 30:03.128
Do I have to twist
your arm again?

30:03.130 --> 30:05.428
Answer the freakin' question!

30:05.430 --> 30:08.092
I don't know anyone
with those initials, okay?

30:08.100 --> 30:11.263
I represent an account holder
who prefers to remain anonymous.

30:11.270 --> 30:13.966
I'm just doing my job
for a client of the bank.

30:13.970 --> 30:15.369
Yeah, well,
where did Jenna run off to?

30:15.380 --> 30:16.904
Is she meeting up
with that mysterious

30:16.910 --> 30:18.878
but generous client?

30:18.880 --> 30:20.199
If you can't find Jenna,
its'cause

30:20.210 --> 30:22.508
she doesn't want to be found.

30:22.520 --> 30:24.943
She hasn't even been answering
my calls or texts.

30:24.950 --> 30:26.747
You sure you don't know
where she is?

30:26.750 --> 30:29.139
I already told you
I wanna cut ties.

30:29.160 --> 30:31.310
And if you're smart, you guys
will stay away from her too.

30:32.390 --> 30:34.551
Whatever she's up to,
her games have gotten

30:34.560 --> 30:36.027
a little dangerous
for my taste.

30:40.800 --> 30:43.360
See, that wasn't so hard,
was it?

30:43.370 --> 30:45.759
Oh, here, don't forget
your yoga pants.

30:45.770 --> 30:47.362
Namaste,
b itc h .

30:50.280 --> 30:51.406
[sighs]

30:51.410 --> 30:54.379
- Did you do it?
- Yup, GPS tracker's in her bag.

30:54.380 --> 30:56.439
'She might not have told us
where Jenna is'

30:56.450 --> 30:57.849
but now she can show us.

30:57.850 --> 30:59.442
I'll call Hanna.

31:03.260 --> 31:04.818
(Hanna)
'Hey, did you find Jenna yet?‘

31:04.830 --> 31:06.786
Part of the way there.
How are you?

31:06.790 --> 31:08.621
Well, A.D. upped the ante.

31:08.630 --> 31:09.995
I'm gonna walk into that room

31:10.000 --> 31:12.457
and flush my entire future
down the toilet.

31:12.470 --> 31:14.722
'But, hey, at least
I get a prize for playing.‘

31:14.740 --> 31:16.196
- Hanna--
- 'I've gotta go.‘

31:16.200 --> 31:18.634
I'll text you when
A.D. delivers my puzzle piece.

[gadget beeping]

31:32.790 --> 31:34.018
[door slams]

31:36.060 --> 31:38.119
- Caleb!
- Hey.

31:38.130 --> 31:40.883
I'm so sorry. I thought
I would be in and out by now.

31:40.900 --> 31:42.253
Wait, Hanna told you?

31:42.260 --> 31:43.591
Yeah, but she didn't really
have a choice.

31:43.600 --> 31:45.727
I mean, A.D. brought the fight
to our front door.

31:45.730 --> 31:46.765
Literally.

31:46.770 --> 31:47.794
[clicking and beeping]

31:47.800 --> 31:49.062
Wait, do you hear that?

31:49.070 --> 31:50.697
It's like a hum
and then a bunch of clicks.

31:50.700 --> 31:53.737
Yeah, trust me that thing makes
all kinds of noise.

31:53.740 --> 31:55.037
I know, I just,
I can't even tell

31:55.040 --> 31:57.133
if it's mechanical
or electrical.

31:57.140 --> 31:58.698
I can't break through
a firewall and hack into it.

31:58.710 --> 32:00.974
I can't even pop the top off
of this thing.

32:00.980 --> 32:02.447
[inhales deeply]

32:03.250 --> 32:05.548
Wait, I'm gonna try something.

32:05.550 --> 32:07.916
Maybe the screws
are underneath the buildings.

32:12.930 --> 32:14.386
You know,
if this is weird, H can

32:14.400 --> 32:15.753
take this with me
or I can come back--

32:15.760 --> 32:17.523
No! It's fine.

32:17.530 --> 32:19.691
I mean, I,
I want this to be fine.

32:21.100 --> 32:23.534
So do I.
And I think it can be.

32:25.110 --> 32:26.702
Do you wanna talk about it?

32:28.680 --> 32:30.409
Or have a drink?

32:30.410 --> 32:33.379
Yeah. Um,
I'll take a beer if you got.

32:33.380 --> 32:35.200
That sounds really good.
I'm gonna have one with you.

32:37.920 --> 32:39.239
That was actually
really easy.

32:40.090 --> 32:42.388
Yeah. It was, wasn't it?

32:46.930 --> 32:48.557
So, there's..

32:49.560 --> 32:51.289
...this guy..

32:51.300 --> 32:53.291
...I kinda just spent
the whole day with him.

32:54.970 --> 32:57.939
- Is it that cop? Furey?
- Yeah.

32:57.940 --> 32:59.999
Yeah, I thought
I picked up on some vibes.

33:01.080 --> 33:04.231
- Can I ask--
- No, I have no idea.

33:04.240 --> 33:06.606
I mean, it's,
the timing just sucks.

33:06.610 --> 33:09.078
Rollins' case is still open,
he's a detective.

33:09.080 --> 33:10.445
Believe me,
anything you're gonna ask

33:10.450 --> 33:12.042
I've already thought of it
a million times.

33:12.050 --> 33:14.518
I was just gonna ask
if he's good to you.

33:14.520 --> 33:15.714
'Cause you deserve that.

33:18.160 --> 33:19.582
Hey, are you okay?

33:19.590 --> 33:21.251
Oh, yeah. No, I'm fine.

33:21.260 --> 33:22.579
How long are you gonna be
working here?

33:22.600 --> 33:23.999
'Cause I was just gonna
order some food

33:24.000 --> 33:25.297
'and maybe we call
and ask Hanna'

33:25.300 --> 33:26.790
'if she wants to join?'

33:26.800 --> 33:30.099
- Uh, sure.
- There's this new Thai place.

33:30.100 --> 33:32.967
So what do you think, like,
curry, noodles..

33:32.970 --> 33:34.528
[Caleb groaning]
Caleb?

33:35.680 --> 33:37.170
Caleb!

33:37.180 --> 33:39.171
Caleb! What's going on?

33:40.080 --> 33:41.741
What happened?

33:41.750 --> 33:43.172
[dramatic music]

33:43.180 --> 33:45.273
- '911. What is your emergency?‘
- Hi!

33:45.290 --> 33:47.485
Um, m—m-my, my friend
is having trouble breathing.

33:47.490 --> 33:48.741
Please, this is an emergency!

33:53.960 --> 33:56.087
[indistinct chatter]

33:56.100 --> 33:57.852
Here.

33:57.870 --> 33:59.189
Let me help you with that..

34:00.430 --> 34:02.694
- You ready?
- Yeah.

34:02.700 --> 34:04.292
I just..

34:04.840 --> 34:06.034
[elevator dings]

34:06.040 --> 34:09.669
[sighs]
This is amazing, Lucas.

34:09.680 --> 34:11.432
I never realized
how much I wanted this

34:11.450 --> 34:13.668
until you gave me everything
I needed to make it happen.

34:13.680 --> 34:16.274
Oh, that's not true. You are
the one with the talent.

34:16.280 --> 34:18.214
Hold one, one sec,
I'm not finished.

34:20.220 --> 34:22.347
I just wanna say this before..

34:23.590 --> 34:24.818
Before what?

34:26.830 --> 34:29.151
Thank you.

34:29.160 --> 34:30.821
You are _
the most generous friend..

34:32.400 --> 34:34.368
...and, you know,
whatever happens up there..

34:36.370 --> 34:39.032
...just promise me
that we'll always be friends.

34:39.040 --> 34:40.564
[elevator dings]

34:41.380 --> 34:42.608
Of course.

34:44.410 --> 34:46.071
Now, let's go wow
those investors

34:46.080 --> 34:48.605
and make
a gajillion dollars, okay?

34:48.620 --> 34:49.700
[cellphone beeps]

34:55.490 --> 34:57.082
Hanna? Look,
if you have the jitters--

34:57.090 --> 34:58.455
No, it's not that.

34:59.990 --> 35:01.218
Caleb's in the hospital.

35:01.230 --> 35:03.425
[dramatic music]

35:03.430 --> 35:06.558
Give me the sketch book. Go!

35:06.570 --> 35:09.198
- Are you sure?
- I will figure something out.

35:09.200 --> 35:11.259
- Go.
- Okay.

35:17.710 --> 35:19.507
Mmm.

35:19.510 --> 35:21.876
Aren't butterscotch krimpets
the best?

35:23.420 --> 35:25.843
I don't know why we ever
bothered to go cake tasting.

35:27.590 --> 35:29.785
I don't know,
should we split the last one?

35:29.790 --> 35:32.281
Uh, no, no, no.
Let's, let's save that.

35:32.290 --> 35:34.155
For our first anniversary.

35:35.400 --> 35:37.197
It's tradition, right?

35:37.200 --> 35:38.428
[inhales deeply]

35:40.970 --> 35:42.028
You know, we never decided

35:42.040 --> 35:43.064
on where we were gonna go

35:43.070 --> 35:44.469
for our honeymoon.

35:44.470 --> 35:46.097
I thought our honeymoon
was gonna be spent

35:46.110 --> 35:47.668
moving into our finished house.

35:49.480 --> 35:51.277
Things are different now.

35:53.280 --> 35:55.441
Where would you wanna go?

35:55.450 --> 35:57.179
Once we get up
and out of here.

35:58.050 --> 35:59.608
Mmm.

36:00.250 --> 36:01.683
I'd rather have

36:01.690 --> 36:03.317
city than beach.

36:04.220 --> 36:05.653
Prague, maybe.

36:06.690 --> 36:08.157
Or Antwerp.

36:09.330 --> 36:11.992
Oh, but you like
the outdoors, so..

36:12.000 --> 36:15.163
How about a week in Buenos Aires

36:15.170 --> 36:17.297
and then a week in Patagonia?

36:18.340 --> 36:19.693
It's the best of both worlds.

36:22.080 --> 36:24.332
Mmm, you know somewhere
I've always wanted to go?

36:24.340 --> 36:26.945
”Mmm?
- Moscow.

36:28.620 --> 36:31.180
In the winter..

36:31.190 --> 36:34.114
...there's a huge ice rink
in Red Square.

36:34.120 --> 36:36.611
It's all lit up at night.

36:37.860 --> 36:39.088
Well, that's where

36:39.090 --> 36:40.682
we'll spend
our first Christmas.

36:41.730 --> 36:43.823
And then after that,
we can go anywhere.

36:45.270 --> 36:46.567
Iceland..

36:47.730 --> 36:48.867
...Tasmania

36:48.870 --> 36:50.929
we could just keep going..

36:52.270 --> 36:53.703
...and going.

36:58.950 --> 37:00.372
Are you happy?

37:03.350 --> 37:04.942
Happiest.

37:05.990 --> 37:08.982
[instrumental music]

37:21.000 --> 37:22.558
[monitor beeping]

37:22.570 --> 37:23.889
Your eyes are all red.

37:24.970 --> 37:26.494
Can you see? Are you okay?

37:27.770 --> 37:29.761
Do you remember that time
when we first met and you, uh

37:29.780 --> 37:32.476
shot a bunch of extra hold
hairspray in my face?

37:32.480 --> 37:33.845
Yeah, this is worse than that.

37:35.780 --> 37:38.146
I couldn't talk,
I couldn't breathe

37:38.150 --> 37:40.516
I, I couldn't even think.

37:40.520 --> 37:42.545
Well, do they know what it was?

37:42.560 --> 37:44.312
Some sort of gas or something?

37:44.320 --> 37:46.151
Well, I mean,
I couldn't exactly tell them

37:46.160 --> 37:47.582
that I was poisoned by some

37:47.590 --> 37:50.195
toxic version of Candy Land.

37:50.200 --> 37:51.656
So I told them
I was cleaning my bath tub

37:51.670 --> 37:53.922
and I accidentally mixed
my bleach and my ammonia

37:53.930 --> 37:55.818
and I knocked myself out.

37:55.840 --> 37:57.990
No lab tests,
no questions, you know.

37:59.910 --> 38:02.367
[sighs]
Hey, how did it go
with the investors?

38:02.380 --> 38:04.439
Oh, I didn't make the meeting

38:04.440 --> 38:06.374
but Lucas is there
covering for me.

38:07.280 --> 38:08.440
It doesn't matter anyways.

38:08.450 --> 38:09.906
Well, if you're not there,
isn't it

38:09.920 --> 38:11.376
kinda like skipping your turn?

38:11.390 --> 38:13.745
Stupid game doesn't matter.

38:13.750 --> 38:15.945
I just wanted to make sure
that you were okay.

38:22.460 --> 38:23.791
[cellphone beeps]

38:27.970 --> 38:29.460
I'll be right back.

38:34.140 --> 38:35.869
[indistinct chatter]

38:35.880 --> 38:38.303
She had to tell him
about the game, guys.

38:38.310 --> 38:39.538
She didn't have a choice.

38:39.550 --> 38:41.404
Was gassing Caleb
her punishment

38:41.420 --> 38:42.944
for tryin' to stop A.D.?

38:42.950 --> 38:44.076
Hey!

38:45.920 --> 38:48.639
I didn't finish my turn,
so I was sent this.

38:49.790 --> 38:51.553
So what happens
to your puzzle pieces?

38:51.560 --> 38:52.754
Does it just go
to some stranger?

38:52.760 --> 38:55.388
- That, that doesn't make sense.
- No.

38:55.400 --> 38:57.459
It's not like winning your turn
makes you a winner.

38:57.460 --> 38:59.519
Then I guess it depends
on whose turn it is.

39:00.600 --> 39:02.261
W—what is that supposed to mean?

39:02.270 --> 39:04.295
All you had to do
was visit a friend.

39:04.300 --> 39:05.892
No false accusations

39:05.910 --> 39:08.561
no skipping out on the most
important meeting of your life.

39:08.580 --> 39:10.309
(Aria)
'Well, maybe that's the point.‘

39:10.310 --> 39:12.039
An unfair game.
It keeps us off balance.

39:12.050 --> 39:13.802
And it gives us somethin'
to bicker about

39:13.810 --> 39:16.506
so that we're not focused
on finding out who A.D. IS.

39:16.520 --> 39:18.943
Look, it's been a long,
rough day for all of us.

39:18.950 --> 39:21.942
So I'm gonna go visit Toby
and Yvonne on the way out.

39:25.290 --> 39:27.053
Look, you guys
don't have to stay.

39:27.060 --> 39:29.358
They're gonna keep him on oxygen
a little while longer

39:29.360 --> 39:31.499
and then release him
In an hour or two.

39:33.100 --> 39:35.091
[device beeping]

39:39.540 --> 39:41.667
Sydney's on the move.

39:41.680 --> 39:44.331
I'll take ﬁrst watch
and follow her tonight.

39:44.340 --> 39:46.001
Come on, I'll drop you off.

39:46.010 --> 39:47.705

Oh, my God.

40:17.910 --> 40:19.775
[sobbing]

40:30.890 --> 40:33.427
Can you call me back, please?

40:34.690 --> 40:36.055
Sabrina just quit..

40:36.060 --> 40:40.053
Um, guess she tried to get
a hold of you..

40:40.070 --> 40:42.868
Anyways, she got
this apprenticeship

40:42.870 --> 40:44.735
with some hot,
new baker in Atlanta

40:44.740 --> 40:45.968
and she has
to be there tomorrow

40:45.970 --> 40:48.507
but she referred
some replacements

40:48.510 --> 40:50.899
so do I call them?

40:50.910 --> 40:54.448
I mean, how do you even
interview a baker?

40:54.450 --> 40:58.079
Ezra, I've never run
a business before and..

40:58.080 --> 41:00.742
I really wanna help you,
I just, I don't..

41:00.750 --> 41:03.389
I don't know what,
exactly what to do.

41:03.390 --> 41:06.211
Things are just kind of
unraveling without you here

41:06.230 --> 41:08.528
and I just, I really wish that..

41:08.530 --> 41:11.249
[dramatic music]

41:11.260 --> 41:13.296
Stay back!

41:13.300 --> 41:14.824
I said stay back!

41:20.210 --> 41:22.508
[breathing heavily]

41:38.860 --> 41:40.657
Oh!

41:40.660 --> 41:42.252
Oh, that's not good.

41:54.640 --> 41:57.837
[dramatic music]

41:58.850 --> 42:01.239
Have someone call Forensics.

42:01.250 --> 42:02.706
