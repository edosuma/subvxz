00:06.006 --> 00:07.757
- Help! Help!

00:07.799 --> 00:10.176
[gags] Intruder!

00:10.218 --> 00:12.345
My big, strong partner
will kill you.

00:12.387 --> 00:14.389
And he's white,
so he won't even go to jail.

00:14.431 --> 00:16.516
Ah!

00:16.558 --> 00:17.726
[groans]

00:17.767 --> 00:19.602
- Are you okay?

00:20.895 --> 00:22.147
- No.

00:22.188 --> 00:23.898
It took you over 30 seconds
to respond.

00:23.940 --> 00:27.193
- Are you making a TikTok
about home invasions?

00:27.235 --> 00:28.820
- You know I always worry
about break-ins.

00:28.862 --> 00:30.071
Having a plan calms me.

00:30.113 --> 00:32.073
So just go downstairs,
and when you hear me,

00:32.115 --> 00:34.075
grab a weapon
and then run back in.

00:39.748 --> 00:41.541
Help! Help!

00:41.583 --> 00:42.459
- Bam!

00:42.500 --> 00:45.170
Hey, bro, stop choking my lady.

00:45.211 --> 00:47.088
She's not even into that.

00:49.632 --> 00:51.134
- A hairbrush?

00:51.176 --> 00:53.303
That's only a weapon
if you have lice.

00:53.345 --> 00:55.180
- Can you keep it down?

00:55.221 --> 00:56.598
I'm already dealing
with your son

00:56.639 --> 00:58.141
in the top bunk,
who's trying to pick

00:58.183 --> 01:00.977
my nose with his big toe.

01:01.019 --> 01:02.687
- Look, it's our
permanent intruder.

01:02.729 --> 01:04.731
- Hey, I told you guys,
I'm only staying here

01:04.773 --> 01:07.650
till my moving business
gets back on its feet--

01:07.692 --> 01:10.111
five years, tops.

01:10.153 --> 01:11.863
- If you heard me
yelling for help,

01:11.905 --> 01:13.198
why didn't you try to save me?

01:13.239 --> 01:16.409
- You think I can't tell
when somebody's faking it?

01:16.451 --> 01:18.578
I learned a lot
being married to your mom.

01:20.246 --> 01:22.415
- And you never said anything?
- Of course not.

01:22.457 --> 01:25.502
'Cause admitting it would
have meant I had to try harder.

01:27.587 --> 01:28.380
It was fine.

01:28.421 --> 01:31.132
I got mine's, you know?

01:31.174 --> 01:33.259
Good night!

01:33.301 --> 01:36.221
<i>[upbeat saxophone music]</i>

01:36.262 --> 01:43.395
<i>* *</i>

01:49.359 --> 01:51.695
- Ay, women in these
true crime stories

01:51.736 --> 01:54.197
always fall for a scam artist,
don't they?

01:54.239 --> 01:55.448
It's like their mothers
didn't teach them

01:55.490 --> 01:57.492
how to spot a cochino.

01:59.369 --> 02:02.330
- Beer, game, quiet.

02:04.833 --> 02:06.167
- I'm not sure
your mother taught you

02:06.209 --> 02:08.878
to spot one, either.

02:08.920 --> 02:11.923
- What the hell
are you doing, cochino?

02:11.965 --> 02:13.383
- It's the seventh inning.

02:13.425 --> 02:14.926
You want to know
how your show ends?

02:14.968 --> 02:16.177
It's the way they always end.

02:16.219 --> 02:19.597
She dies,
and the husband did it.

02:19.639 --> 02:21.307
- If you don't give me
that remote, tonight,

02:21.349 --> 02:23.184
the ex-wife is gonna do it.

02:25.311 --> 02:26.604
- You guys aren't even
watching, anyways.

02:26.646 --> 02:28.398
You're on your phone
half the time.

02:28.440 --> 02:30.984
- Sorry, what?

02:31.026 --> 02:33.445
I just got a notification
on my Citizen Alert app.

02:33.486 --> 02:36.322
- Oh, no, what happened?

02:36.364 --> 02:37.824
- Wait a minute.

02:37.866 --> 02:40.869
There's an app that can track
if you're a citizen?

02:47.375 --> 02:50.670
Mayan, do me a favor.
Propose to Oscar.

02:50.712 --> 02:52.797
- He's your best friend
and weed guy.

02:52.839 --> 02:55.175
You marry him.

02:55.216 --> 02:57.635
- He doesn't trust me.

02:57.677 --> 02:59.554
He knows
I'll never be faithful.

03:04.726 --> 03:06.227
You and your life partner,
Quinten,

03:06.269 --> 03:07.562
aren't married, anyways.

03:07.604 --> 03:09.564
You're living in this house
in shame.

03:09.606 --> 03:11.775
- George,
they're not living in shame.

03:11.816 --> 03:12.817
- Thanks, Mom.

03:12.859 --> 03:14.235
- They're living in sin.

03:16.571 --> 03:18.656
- Anyway, the Citizen Alert app
just alerts you

03:18.698 --> 03:20.033
about crimes happening nearby.

03:20.075 --> 03:22.369
Like earlier,
there was a report of a drunk

03:22.410 --> 03:24.746
in a green hoodie
stealing lemons from a yard.

03:30.919 --> 03:33.630
- Not drunk yet.

03:33.672 --> 03:35.090
You know, back in the day,

03:35.131 --> 03:38.510
our Citizens Alert
was Doña Paloma.

03:38.551 --> 03:42.305
She could tell you who got shot
and who was cheating,

03:42.347 --> 03:45.392
which is probably why
they got shot.

03:45.433 --> 03:46.810
- Speaking of getting shot,

03:46.851 --> 03:48.895
did you hear all those
gunshots last night?

03:48.937 --> 03:50.772
- Yeah, I told Chance
they were fireworks

03:50.814 --> 03:51.856
so that he wouldn't get scared.

03:51.898 --> 03:54.484
- He doesn't know
the difference?

03:54.526 --> 03:56.277
My grandfather
taught me the difference

03:56.319 --> 03:57.987
when I was three years old.

03:58.029 --> 04:02.992
I know gunfire like
a rich person knows wine.

04:03.034 --> 04:07.497
Like, that is a 2009...

04:07.539 --> 04:11.334
.45 caliber--wait--

04:11.376 --> 04:15.213
chrome handle.

04:15.255 --> 04:16.756
- Did you hear
about the break-in

04:16.798 --> 04:19.551
a couple of blocks away?
- No. How did I miss that?

04:19.592 --> 04:21.761
- Oh, it was on the Citizen
Alert last Tuesday night.

04:21.803 --> 04:25.974
- Oh, well, that's the night
when Quinten and I are...busy.

04:29.019 --> 04:30.311
Why am I apologizing?

04:30.353 --> 04:32.105
This is a sex-positive house,
okay?

04:32.147 --> 04:35.608
We get biz-ay.

04:35.650 --> 04:38.194
On Tuesdays between "Top Chef"

04:38.236 --> 04:40.989
and "Below Deck Mediterranean."

04:42.824 --> 04:46.077
- Of course,
you two schedule it.

04:46.119 --> 04:49.456
- You used to schedule it,
too, just not with me.

04:52.167 --> 04:54.085
- Oh, my God, I found the post.

04:54.127 --> 04:57.464
The family was home, and they
had to fight the guy off?

04:57.505 --> 04:58.965
I gotta chill out.
That reminds me.

04:59.007 --> 05:00.258
I forgot to take
my pill this morning.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.468
- Uh-oh.

05:01.509 --> 05:02.927
Last time I heard
your mother say that,

05:02.969 --> 05:06.306
I became a father.

05:06.348 --> 05:08.099
- It's not birth control.

05:08.141 --> 05:09.893
I take them for my anxiety.

05:09.934 --> 05:11.519
- Anxiety?
Who told you you had that?

05:11.561 --> 05:15.565
- Uh, science.

05:15.607 --> 05:17.317
A doctor prescribed them
to me years ago.

05:17.359 --> 05:19.235
Before that,
I was in a constant state

05:19.277 --> 05:21.654
of fear and feeling unsafe.

05:21.696 --> 05:24.366
- That's not anxiety.
That's being brown in America.

05:26.785 --> 05:28.495
They don't have
a pill for that.

05:28.536 --> 05:30.121
- Ay, George, leave her alone.

05:30.163 --> 05:32.749
She likes the pills.

05:32.791 --> 05:35.794
- And you're okay with these?
What, is she slipping you some?

05:35.835 --> 05:38.755
- No, I don't take those.
They dull your senses.

05:38.797 --> 05:42.759
I'm not about to get kidnapped
and sex trafficked.

05:42.801 --> 05:44.844
- I don't think there's
a market in sex trafficking

05:44.886 --> 05:46.888
for some viejita with bunions.

05:49.891 --> 05:51.226
- Hey, guys.

05:51.267 --> 05:53.144
- Did you know the mother
of your child is on drugs?

05:53.186 --> 05:55.563
- Just a little gummy on
Tuesday nights when we're--

05:57.941 --> 05:59.859
Busy.

05:59.901 --> 06:01.611
- Dad is freaking out
because he just found out

06:01.653 --> 06:03.154
I take anti-anxiety pills.

06:03.196 --> 06:04.781
- Because there's
nothing wrong with you.

06:04.823 --> 06:07.158
Your generation is just looking
for an excuse to take drugs.

06:07.200 --> 06:10.704
You're all like, oh, Chastity,
you look so depressed.

06:10.745 --> 06:14.541
Have you tried
microdosing shrooms?

06:14.582 --> 06:18.169
It'll change your life.

06:18.211 --> 06:22.382
- George, my sister,
Chastity, was depressed.

06:22.424 --> 06:25.260
And it did change her life.

06:25.301 --> 06:26.886
- What I'm saying is,
you only need to take pills

06:26.928 --> 06:28.555
if you're a real loca,
like my tía Mimi,

06:28.596 --> 06:31.141
the one that used to talk
to her plants.

06:31.182 --> 06:33.685
- Studies show that
actually helps them grow.

06:33.727 --> 06:36.855
- She didn't own any plants.

06:36.896 --> 06:39.607
- Anti-anxiety medications
are a great coping mechanism.

06:39.649 --> 06:42.402
It's just like this new
vibrating tool I ordered.

06:42.444 --> 06:43.778
- Ay, careful.

06:43.820 --> 06:44.988
You give Mayan one of those,

06:45.030 --> 06:47.824
she's not gonna need you
on Tuesdays.

06:47.866 --> 06:50.493
- We have those,
and we use them on Wednesdays

06:50.535 --> 06:54.414
between "Chicago Med"
and "Chicago Fire."

06:54.456 --> 06:55.915
- Yeah, yeah!

06:55.957 --> 06:58.084
- Yes, sir!

06:58.126 --> 07:02.589
- No, this is a biofeedback
device that you wear.

07:02.630 --> 07:04.132
It vibrates and beeps
when you're anxious

07:04.174 --> 07:07.218
to remind you
to take deep breaths.

07:07.260 --> 07:11.931
- You paid for something
that reminds you to breathe?

07:11.973 --> 07:13.433
If you're worried about safety,

07:13.475 --> 07:14.684
you need to get
a security system.

07:14.726 --> 07:15.935
- We can't afford that.

07:15.977 --> 07:17.354
I mean,
I would have gotten one,

07:17.395 --> 07:19.105
but we had to use our savings
to finish the kitchen

07:19.147 --> 07:21.274
because someone
didn't let me know

07:21.316 --> 07:24.027
about his financial problems.

07:24.069 --> 07:25.695
- They're called boundaries,
Chastity.

07:25.737 --> 07:26.946
Respect them.

07:29.282 --> 07:31.284
- Quinten, let's go see
if this thing works.

07:31.326 --> 07:32.535
You can trigger my anxiety

07:32.577 --> 07:34.412
by trying to explain NFTs
to me again.

07:34.454 --> 07:35.622
- Yes.

07:37.707 --> 07:39.125
- She doesn't feel safe
in this house.

07:39.167 --> 07:40.794
That's not good.

07:40.835 --> 07:42.587
I'm gonna secure
this house myself.

07:42.629 --> 07:43.963
It's not gonna
cost them anything.

07:44.005 --> 07:46.549
- Oh, no, I know your idea
of a security system.

07:46.591 --> 07:50.261
It's doing a chalk outline
of a dead body in the driveway.

07:52.180 --> 07:55.308
- No one wants to be the second
dead body in the driveway.

07:55.350 --> 07:56.893
<i>* *</i>

08:00.563 --> 08:03.483
<i>[upbeat saxophone music]</i>

08:03.525 --> 08:05.318
<i>* *</i>

08:05.360 --> 08:07.362
- You really think someone
might break in here?

08:07.404 --> 08:08.613
- No.

08:08.655 --> 08:10.281
You know this was
my grandma's house, right?

08:10.323 --> 08:12.283
When I grew up,
it was much more dangerous,

08:12.325 --> 08:13.785
and we never had a problem.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.245
- Really?
- Yep.

08:15.286 --> 08:17.122
Because the Latinos,
we would look after each other.

08:17.163 --> 08:19.249
It's the hipsters now
that are moving in,

08:19.290 --> 08:21.876
coming home with 30 bags
from Target.

08:21.918 --> 08:24.796
They become the target.

08:24.838 --> 08:26.548
- My dad loves Target.

08:26.589 --> 08:30.010
- Yeah, well, good thing
he's not your real dad.

08:30.051 --> 08:31.553
- Yes, he is.

08:31.594 --> 08:34.973
Mommy says you just say that
to mask your own insecurities

08:35.015 --> 08:37.225
since your dad left you.

08:40.478 --> 08:41.855
- Damn.

08:41.896 --> 08:43.648
That cut like a knife. Up top.

08:46.067 --> 08:47.527
- Where you want
these ADT signs?

08:47.569 --> 08:49.779
- Um, let's put two in the
front and put two in the back.

08:49.821 --> 08:51.614
- I thought we couldn't afford
a security service.

08:51.656 --> 08:55.201
- We don't need the service.
We got the signs.

08:55.243 --> 08:56.911
- What if they don't
believe the signs?

08:56.953 --> 08:58.413
- Nah, no one's
getting in here.

08:58.455 --> 09:00.040
I secured all the windows
and doors.

09:00.081 --> 09:01.207
No one's getting in.

09:01.249 --> 09:02.667
- Is that a challenge?

09:02.709 --> 09:04.002
- It can be.

09:04.044 --> 09:05.211
You don't have
any money to bet.

09:05.253 --> 09:07.255
How about we bet
a little hello?

09:07.297 --> 09:10.633
- A little hey there.

09:10.675 --> 09:12.469
- A little how you doing?

09:12.510 --> 09:13.887
- My son's here.

09:13.928 --> 09:17.891
How about we say goodbye
to the hello?

09:17.932 --> 09:19.351
- Grandpa, can we show Dad

09:19.392 --> 09:20.894
the coolest part
of your system?

09:20.935 --> 09:24.022
- Yeah. Hey, get the lights.

09:24.064 --> 09:25.815
- What? Yes!

09:25.857 --> 09:27.776
Are those
motion-detecting lasers?

09:27.817 --> 09:30.028
- Watch.
I know how to beat them.

09:40.955 --> 09:43.124
- Okay, Tomasito Cruise.

09:45.710 --> 09:48.546
Oh, what the hell is that?
One got loose.

09:48.588 --> 09:51.174
- Wait, shouldn't they trigger
an alarm or something?

09:51.216 --> 09:52.717
- No, they're just
laser pointers

09:52.759 --> 09:56.262
I taped up around the room
and connected them to a remote.

09:56.304 --> 09:58.682
- What's the point, then,
make all the cats

09:58.723 --> 09:59.808
in the neighborhood go insane?

09:59.849 --> 10:01.434
A-ha.
That's--

10:01.476 --> 10:04.604
I'm sorr--this is ridiculous.

10:04.646 --> 10:07.315
- What's ridiculous is that
Mayan's afraid of a break-in,

10:07.357 --> 10:08.983
and all she's got
to protect her is a man

10:09.025 --> 10:10.610
whose only weapon is karma.

10:10.652 --> 10:13.822
- Ha! Thank you.

10:13.863 --> 10:15.198
- It's not a compliment.

10:15.240 --> 10:17.325
You don't make your woman
feel safe, bro.

10:17.367 --> 10:20.286
- Oh, I'm pretty sure
she feels safe with me.

10:20.328 --> 10:22.914
I can handle
any kind of intruder.

10:22.956 --> 10:25.125
- Yeah, said the man
wearing a double wrist brace

10:25.166 --> 10:26.960
for carpal tunnel.

10:27.002 --> 10:29.212
- This is preventative.

10:29.254 --> 10:31.631
The Genius Bar is
a physically demanding job.

10:31.673 --> 10:34.009
I wipe porn off of at least
100 computers a day.

10:34.050 --> 10:37.137
And my hand, it hurts.

10:37.178 --> 10:40.932
- Porn makes my hand hurt too.

10:40.974 --> 10:41.975
- What's the point
of you being here

10:42.017 --> 10:43.351
if you can't step up
like a real man?

10:43.393 --> 10:45.228
If you won't protect
my daughter, then I will.

10:48.857 --> 10:51.609
- Oh, come on.

10:51.651 --> 10:52.610
You didn't.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.404
- This is your new

built with the finest parts
the 99 Cent Store has to offer.

10:59.284 --> 11:02.162
- You put tape
on my beautiful walls?

This paint is Eva Longoria
for Walmart.

11:11.713 --> 11:12.964
It can't be
the smoke detectors.

11:13.006 --> 11:14.174
I got rid of those
useless things

11:14.215 --> 11:16.676
to make room for the lasers.

11:16.718 --> 11:20.055
- It's the biofeedback device
reminding me to breathe.

11:20.096 --> 11:22.515
- Oh, I thought
it was my pager.

11:22.557 --> 11:25.185
And then I was like,
it's not 1992, man.

11:25.226 --> 11:28.730
And then I wished it was 1992.

11:28.772 --> 11:30.523
And then I got sad.

11:30.565 --> 11:31.358
Then--

11:31.399 --> 11:34.277
- Zip it, Leech & Chong.

11:34.319 --> 11:37.155
I want you guys to get rid
of all this stuff now.

11:37.197 --> 11:38.990
- I got this, babe.

11:39.032 --> 11:42.827
I want you guys to get rid
of all this stuff now.

11:42.869 --> 11:44.537
- All right,
we're almost done, anyways.

11:44.579 --> 11:46.790
Hey, Oscar, grab that chalk
and go lay down outside.

11:46.831 --> 11:48.083
I'll trace your dead body.

it's making my anxiety worse.

- No, Mayan, those pills
are making your anxiety worse.

11:57.759 --> 12:00.595
And let's face it, anxiety
is not even a real thing.

12:00.637 --> 12:01.763
- Excuse me?

12:01.805 --> 12:04.349
- Yeah, it's like Dracula
or, you know,

12:04.391 --> 12:07.268
global warming,
peanut allergies.

a nut-free household, right?

12:10.730 --> 12:13.191
- Trust me, it's not.

12:13.233 --> 12:14.442
- That's it.

12:14.484 --> 12:15.819
You don't get to say
what's real for me.

12:15.860 --> 12:18.446
You can't tell me
that my feelings aren't valid.

12:18.488 --> 12:20.281
- I think your feelings
are valid about the paint.

12:20.323 --> 12:22.409
What are they,
like, $33 a gallon?

12:22.450 --> 12:23.910
- Okay, so you're just gonna
make light of this

12:23.952 --> 12:24.911
and walk away?

12:24.953 --> 12:26.705

13:15.754 --> 13:17.589
I've realized I'm so loud,
the neighbors will just hear

and your dad says I'm not
a man, which is so toxic,

13:29.017 --> 13:31.353
but it still--it hits me
right in the gut,

13:31.394 --> 13:35.398
which then makes me toxic too.

13:35.440 --> 13:39.611
I don't deserve

You're destroying my home.

And now you're insulting
Quinten by telling him

13:53.208 --> 13:55.001
he's not a man?

13:55.043 --> 13:58.004
- Well, a real man wouldn't
go snitching to his woman.

14:00.507 --> 14:02.509
- You see? What did I say?

14:04.594 --> 14:06.596
- Mayan, you're just nervous
because you don't think

14:06.638 --> 14:08.556
your man will step up
in a time of crisis

14:08.598 --> 14:12.018
because everything about him
says, "Eek! A mouse!"

14:15.563 --> 14:19.067

14:23.196 --> 14:24.781
Leave him out of it.

14:24.823 --> 14:26.366

You can't sleep comfortably in

14:36.626 --> 14:38.837
You weren't home.

14:38.878 --> 14:41.131
Mom and I were alone
in the house,

14:41.172 --> 14:42.549
and I was always worried

14:42.590 --> 14:44.467
something bad was gonna happen.

14:44.509 --> 14:47.512
It gave me so much anxiety.

past your security system.

15:36.102 --> 15:38.063

I secured everything.

15:38.104 --> 15:40.106
Wow, man, somebody could have
really broken in.

15:42.233 --> 15:44.611
Something bad could have
happened to Chance.

15:44.652 --> 15:46.905

We're all safe.

15:46.946 --> 15:48.698

16:34.452 --> 16:35.954

an anxiety attack.

16:35.995 --> 16:38.540
- You know what, Mayan?
Stop being so extra.

16:40.458 --> 16:44.129
I was flushed, I was sweating,
and my heart was racing.

16:44.170 --> 16:47.298
- Those are the exact symptoms
of an anxiety attack.

16:47.340 --> 16:48.675
And they happen to me too.

16:48.717 --> 16:52.053
- So it's contagious.
You gave it to me.

16:52.095 --> 16:54.514
- No, you and Mom
gave it to me.

16:54.556 --> 16:56.599
And your parents
gave it to you.

16:56.641 --> 16:58.143
Some people pass down wealth.

16:58.184 --> 17:00.186
We pass down trauma.

17:03.565 --> 17:05.567
- I might have gotten
a little something

17:05.608 --> 17:07.318
passed down
from my grandmother.

17:07.360 --> 17:11.656
You know, when she used to
get mad at me,

17:11.698 --> 17:14.367
man, she used to lock me
in the closet.

17:14.409 --> 17:15.827
That didn't feel great.

17:15.869 --> 17:17.662
- Oh, my God, that's so scary.

17:17.704 --> 17:18.955
- Yeah, it was scary.

17:18.997 --> 17:20.457
And then that's the first time
I remember

17:20.498 --> 17:22.542
getting that same bad feeling
that I just got right now.

17:22.584 --> 17:24.836
- An anxiety attack?

17:24.878 --> 17:26.546
- We don't have
to give it a name.

17:28.882 --> 17:31.718
Eventually, I got too big
to fit in the closet.

17:33.887 --> 17:35.680
She started locking me
in the neighbor's closet

17:35.722 --> 17:37.557
because they had a walk-in.

17:41.061 --> 17:42.812
- It's not easy
feeling this way,

17:42.854 --> 17:46.649
but therapy and taking
medication help me manage it.

17:46.691 --> 17:49.527
- I'm sorry that
I wasn't around.

17:49.569 --> 17:53.698
But I thought me not being
around would be better for you

17:53.740 --> 17:56.201
than me being there.

- This is gonna sound crazy,
but I actually think

18:26.606 --> 18:30.235
the spirit of RBG
was guiding me.

18:30.276 --> 18:32.153

you could stay off of it

20:50.625 --> 20:52.002

20:52.043 --> 20:56.006
- Might I remind you
that my pupusa guy...

20:58.925 --> 21:01.386
Also caters lawyer conventions?

21:01.428 --> 21:05.890
And he thinks what you did to
me was technically an assault.

21:05.932 --> 21:07.684
- I'll get the Tapatío.

21:07.726 --> 21:09.144
- Oscar!

21:09.185 --> 21:12.814

21:12.856 --> 21:14.566

- Come and check it out, man.

21:14.607 --> 21:16.443
Get your chalk!

21:18.570 --> 21:21.364
And that's how you get him
off the couch.

21:23.992 --> 21:26.286
