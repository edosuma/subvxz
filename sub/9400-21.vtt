00:18.430 --> 00:20.260
Uh,are these the pages from my book?

00:20.260 --> 00:22.040
The "comet," not "ravens,"

00:22.040 --> 00:23.640
and I cannot be held accountable,

00:23.640 --> 00:27.640
'cause baby and me have gone
completely bed-rest stir crazy.

00:29.220 --> 00:30.620
What?

00:34.190 --> 00:37.020
Great. I've got permanent bed
head,and you're laughing at me.

00:37.640 --> 00:39.560
Look,I'm --
I'm sorry.

00:39.560 --> 00:42.120
I know how hard it is being
cooped up in the house.

00:42.120 --> 00:43.140
"Hard"?

00:43.140 --> 00:44.830
I have read this month's issue of B.

00:44.830 --> 00:49.210
Davis magazine cover
to cover five times.

00:51.580 --> 00:53.640
Just stay and tell me stories

00:53.640 --> 00:56.100
about life on the outside.

00:57.110 --> 00:59.230
I can'T. I'm working on something.

00:59.230 --> 01:01.520
Why have you been so weird lately?

01:01.520 --> 01:04.040
You're,like,off in the garage,

01:04.040 --> 01:06.980
and yo-- you're
making me a present.

01:06.980 --> 01:08.270
Are you making the baby a present?

01:08.270 --> 01:10.640
Is it a present for me and the baby?

01:10.640 --> 01:11.800
All right.

01:11.800 --> 01:13.000
Uh,y-you know what? You're right.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.010
Well,yeah,I'm right,

01:14.010 --> 01:15.400
so just stay and let me guess.

01:15.400 --> 01:16.640
No,no. I mean,you're right.

01:16.640 --> 01:18.650
You're going completely crazy.

01:24.200 --> 01:26.520
crazy people should not be left alone.

01:29.380 --> 01:32.650
Funny. I thought vampires
didn't photograph.

01:37.310 --> 01:40.030
Emsam,rind me to buy
you a garlic necklace.

01:40.030 --> 01:41.590
Good morning,brooke.

01:41.590 --> 01:43.160
Being dramatic,as usual.

01:43.160 --> 01:45.280
I'm not being dramatic. I'm being a mom.

01:45.280 --> 01:47.700
And that means keeping
sam out of harm's way.

01:47.700 --> 01:50.900
- Ah,so I guess I'm "harm."
- No.

01:50.900 --> 01:55.400
You're "harm's" older,decrepit
sister,"emotional damage.

01:55.400 --> 01:56.400
"Okay.

01:56.400 --> 02:00.330
We bought you caffeine,so play nice.

02:00.880 --> 02:02.080
Thank you.

02:07.090 --> 02:08.340
What are you up to?

02:08.340 --> 02:10.630
Nothing. I like samantha.

02:10.630 --> 02:12.470
She's plucky and dark.

02:12.470 --> 02:14.250
She's going through a really hard time.

02:14.250 --> 02:15.360
Yeah,I know about jack.

02:15.360 --> 02:16.650
Not just jack.

02:16.650 --> 02:18.820
Sam wants a family.

02:18.820 --> 02:21.780
She is vulnerable,and I don't
want her latching onto you

02:21.780 --> 02:23.340
just so that you can
end up disappointing her.

02:23.340 --> 02:24.730
I don't intend to disappoint her.

02:24.730 --> 02:26.230
You never do.

02:31.990 --> 02:34.310
Well,hurry along. We don't tip.

02:37.940 --> 02:40.270
Do you have to be such a bitch?

02:40.270 --> 02:42.270
I'm wrong when I'm nice.
I'm wrong when I'm mean.

02:42.270 --> 02:43.280
I just can't win with you.

02:43.280 --> 02:46.010
No,you can't,so please stop trying.

02:46.010 --> 02:50.800
I told you,this relationship is
about business,and that includes sam.

03:06.280 --> 03:07.740
Brought you this month's issue of B.

03:07.740 --> 03:09.470
Davis magazine.

03:12.570 --> 03:15.970
Our ceiling fan does
147 rotations a minute.

03:15.970 --> 03:19.250
Well,that answers my question
about how mama's doing.

03:19.250 --> 03:20.350
How's baby?

03:20.350 --> 03:22.820
Baby is kicking baby-growing ass.

03:22.820 --> 03:24.270
The doctor says we're doing good.

03:24.270 --> 03:26.390
Good. That's what auntie
haley likes to hear.

03:26.390 --> 03:28.100
Good job in there,kiddo.

03:28.100 --> 03:32.570
So,I got antinteresng call
from the label this morning.

03:32.570 --> 03:34.770
Oh,let me guess -- they want
mia's album like last week,

03:34.770 --> 03:36.910
which,by the way,is gonna be fantastic,

03:36.910 --> 03:38.710
which is unbiased,even
though I am the producer.

03:38.710 --> 03:41.540
Okay. Call wasn't about mia.

03:41.540 --> 03:43.160
They want to buy one of your songs.

03:43.160 --> 03:45.610
I guess they have an
artist that heard it

03:45.610 --> 03:50.360
and fell in love with
it and blah,blah,blah.

03:52.800 --> 03:54.810
I never thought about selling my songs.

03:54.810 --> 03:57.200
Okay,well,from the way
they were raving about you,

03:57.200 --> 04:00.030
you might want to
start thinking about it.

04:03.640 --> 04:05.490
I'll come off the bench.

04:05.860 --> 04:07.140
Hey,I'll do whatever it takes.

04:07.140 --> 04:09.230
I just want back on the team.

04:09.230 --> 04:11.560
Devon...coach.

04:11.560 --> 04:13.500
...You know how this league works.

04:14.000 --> 04:18.260
There is always someone right behind
you ready to do whatever it takes.

04:18.810 --> 04:20.450
The roster's full.

04:20.990 --> 04:22.560
I am sorry.

04:34.960 --> 04:36.050
Hey,scott.

04:36.050 --> 04:37.360
You're here early.

04:37.360 --> 04:38.580
I'm meeting nino.

04:38.580 --> 04:40.780
We're just gonna run through
some drills before practice.

04:40.780 --> 04:42.180
Good. Glad to hear that.

04:42.180 --> 04:43.800
You know,you two have
been playing together

04:43.800 --> 04:45.310
really well these last weeks.

04:45.310 --> 04:46.410
Thanks.

04:46.410 --> 04:48.690
And I'm not the only one who's noticed.

04:48.690 --> 04:52.140
Been getting some calls
about you -- scouts.

04:53.050 --> 04:56.160
Now,there's nothing concrete yet,

04:56.160 --> 04:58.930
but as I know more,you'll know more.

04:59.510 --> 05:02.230
- Nice work,nathan.
- Thanks.

05:31.240 --> 05:32.960
What are you shredding?

05:32.960 --> 05:35.470
Nothing. Junk mail.

06:14.400 --> 06:15.600
well,you have two choices.

06:15.600 --> 06:17.930
You get me the fabric on time,at cost,

06:17.930 --> 06:22.460
or your "little start-up
company that could" -- it won'T.

06:30.550 --> 06:31.960
What now?

06:31.960 --> 06:33.230
It's the new line.

06:33.230 --> 06:36.120
It's -- it's
soooD. Fresh.

06:36.120 --> 06:38.300
Some of your best work.

06:38.300 --> 06:41.100
But you've always been
a talented girl,brooke.

06:41.100 --> 06:42.670
Thank you.

06:43.490 --> 06:45.530
Now,would you stop
threatening our suppliers?

06:45.530 --> 06:47.060
It's tacky.

06:54.430 --> 06:56.250
Well,nice chip at the wall.

06:57.340 --> 06:59.860
Who says I'm trying to chip the wall?

07:03.360 --> 07:05.060
Daughter seems sad lately.

07:05.060 --> 07:08.300
What gave her away -- the "kick
me,I'm sad" sign on her prada?

07:08.300 --> 07:10.740
No,it's her designs. They're so good.

07:10.740 --> 07:14.400
And she built a fashion empire on
a broken heart,so who's the boy?

07:14.400 --> 07:17.040
Julian. Cliffsnotes
version --

07:17.040 --> 07:19.540
boy meets girl,girl falls crazy in love,

07:19.540 --> 07:23.480
can't admit it,boy moves away,asks
girl to come,girl says no.

07:23.480 --> 07:26.250
And girl buries herself in work.

07:26.250 --> 07:28.270
I've read this book before.

07:28.270 --> 07:29.370
I hear bonding.

07:29.370 --> 07:32.410
Back away from the innocent,victoria.

07:38.490 --> 07:42.140
So,haley still has to put her
mojo on it,but what do you think?

07:42.140 --> 07:43.720
I love it.

07:43.720 --> 07:47.090
And I love chase for inspiring
the hell out of you lately.

07:47.090 --> 07:51.450
Well,let's just say good
kissing inspires good music.

07:51.450 --> 07:54.180
Yeah,he is a good kisser.

07:54.180 --> 07:58.900
I mean,that one
tiny,little,inconsequential,

07:58.900 --> 08:02.120
hardly memorable time
that I kissed him,you know?

08:02.120 --> 08:04.480
- You too?
- It was twice.

08:04.480 --> 08:08.360
I mean,honey,it was only to
make lucas and brooke jealous.

08:08.360 --> 08:11.460
Great. I'm still trying to
forget that he kissed brooke.

08:11.460 --> 08:13.500
B.T.W.,Not going so well.

08:13.500 --> 08:15.470
Honey,why are you so
worried about the kiing part?

08:15.470 --> 08:19.460
I mean,I thought you'd be more
concerned with the virginity part.

08:19.460 --> 08:21.300
The what part?

08:21.300 --> 08:24.420
And you didn't know that.

08:27.780 --> 08:29.420
So,uncle skills,it's been a month,

08:29.420 --> 08:31.620
and you still haven't
talked to miss lauren.

08:31.620 --> 08:33.460
Hey,ask her to the dance tonight.

08:33.460 --> 08:35.049
I'm good.

08:35.820 --> 08:37.970
Just trying to hook a brother up.

08:37.970 --> 08:40.039
Wait,so all you guys
got dates to the dance?

08:40.039 --> 08:41.130
Not me.

08:41.130 --> 08:43.340
Q always said,"don't
bring sand to the beach.

08:43.340 --> 08:45.740
" Is the dance at the beach?

08:45.740 --> 08:47.380
What about you,J. Luke?

08:47.380 --> 08:48.680
Hey,guys!

08:48.680 --> 08:50.280
Hey,madison.

08:50.280 --> 08:51.620
Hey,jamie.

08:51.620 --> 08:52.840
Madison,you're late.

08:52.840 --> 08:55.570
One lap around the park. Go.

08:57.050 --> 09:00.160
I bet jamie's gonna ask madison.

09:00.160 --> 09:01.270
No,I'm not.

09:01.270 --> 09:02.860
Chuck,andre,no teasing.

09:02.860 --> 09:05.820
One lap around the park.

09:06.650 --> 09:08.000
I thought you were feeling madison.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.590
Well,I'm not gonna be the only
guy at the dance with a date.

09:10.590 --> 09:12.460
Besides,you said all women are no good.

09:12.460 --> 09:14.690
No,I said nanny deb was no good.

09:14.690 --> 09:16.460
Is there anything you don't remember?

09:16.460 --> 09:18.360
Genius.

09:19.940 --> 09:21.900
Who cares whe peoplthink?

09:21.900 --> 09:23.650
I mean,you're a leader,right?

09:23.650 --> 09:27.100
So if you want to ask
madison,I say go for it.

09:32.400 --> 09:33.930
My man.

09:51.190 --> 09:53.010
Open your eyes.

09:55.070 --> 09:57.400
Told you you had one
last graduation gift.

09:57.400 --> 09:59.140
The cure?

09:59.140 --> 10:01.610
Tonight in atlanta.

10:01.610 --> 10:04.290
But I'm supposed to be leaving
for L.A. Today with brooke.

10:04.290 --> 10:07.050
Yeah,I know,but brooke and
chase are having their own...

10:07.050 --> 10:08.910
extended goodbye.

10:10.600 --> 10:12.700
Brooke says you can
leave in the morning.

10:13.040 --> 10:14.860
I mean,unless you don't want to go.

10:14.860 --> 10:17.160
No,no,no,no,no! I'm going.

10:17.160 --> 10:18.910
And you are gonna get
into a hell of a lot

10:18.910 --> 10:21.600
more than a concert with these tickets.

10:27.390 --> 10:29.240
So,what do you got for me?

10:29.240 --> 10:31.160
Congratulations,nathan.

10:31.160 --> 10:33.250
- You got an offer.
- From the nba?

10:33.250 --> 10:36.020
It's from a european team,but
the money is really good,

10:36.020 --> 10:37.540
and it's a two-year deal.

10:37.540 --> 10:38.550
Wait. Europe?

10:38.550 --> 10:41.700
Nathan,a lot of really good players
are leaving the nba to go to europe.

10:41.700 --> 10:43.520
Great. Give me one of their spots.

10:43.520 --> 10:46.410
Look,I know that this is not the
offer that you were expecting.

10:46.410 --> 10:49.630
But this is still a good
offer from a good team.

10:55.590 --> 10:57.500
Well,when do they need to know?

10:59.280 --> 11:01.570
They'll move on another choice tomorrow.

11:10.000 --> 11:13.040
How lame is my life that my only friends

11:13.040 --> 11:15.400
are a 5-year-old
and my foster granny?

11:15.400 --> 11:16.960
Language,samantha.

11:16.960 --> 11:19.880
Brooke would totally freak if she
knew I was hanging out with you.

11:19.880 --> 11:21.500
Well,you're a young lady.

11:21.500 --> 11:23.440
You need to look like a young lady.

11:23.440 --> 11:24.810
Language,victoria.

11:24.810 --> 11:27.140
And as for brooke,she'll learn she
can't pick her daughter's friends.

11:27.140 --> 11:31.130
That's a lesson I like to call
"the peyton sawyer debacle.

11:32.250 --> 11:34.020
" Oh,um,I can't go in here.

11:34.020 --> 11:35.780
Salesperson kind of hates me.

11:35.780 --> 11:37.280
Since when?

11:37.690 --> 11:41.880
Since the salesperson
caught me shoplifting.

11:41.880 --> 11:44.000
You got caught shoplifting?

11:44.000 --> 11:45.440
Do you know how much clothes over bros

11:45.440 --> 11:48.470
ost in profit last year
because of shoplifting?

11:48.470 --> 11:49.490
Millions.

11:49.490 --> 11:53.010
It's why those prices that you're
always complaining about are so high.

11:53.010 --> 11:54.260
Okay.

11:54.260 --> 11:57.170
You are a member of this family now.

11:57.170 --> 11:59.980
Theft is common. We don't do common.

11:59.980 --> 12:03.870
Okay. I don't do it anymore.

12:03.870 --> 12:05.820
Well,why did you do iat all?

12:05.820 --> 12:07.850
I don't know. I guesi
got a high from it.

12:07.850 --> 12:10.310
Well,find another way to get high.

12:10.310 --> 12:11.710
Okay,your words.

12:11.710 --> 12:15.830
And as for this salesperson,if she
wants y out,she'll have to deal with me.

12:15.830 --> 12:17.980
Let's go.

12:22.430 --> 12:24.560
Nice day for carrot sticks,huh?

12:25.270 --> 12:27.690
Speaking of the
dance,want to go with me?

12:27.690 --> 12:30.800
I'm sorry,jamie. Chuck just asked me.

12:30.800 --> 12:33.210
Chuck?

12:36.490 --> 12:38.390
Chuck.

12:43.460 --> 12:45.730
Did you know that chase
lost his virginity to brooke?

12:46.800 --> 12:48.380
Yes.

12:49.130 --> 12:53.290
And I'm guessing from the look on
your face,you did not know that.

12:53.290 --> 12:54.880
Well,welcome to tree hill.

12:54.880 --> 12:56.370
I challenge you to
find a boy that did not

12:56.370 --> 12:58.730
lose his virginity to brooke davis.

12:59.500 --> 13:01.050
But she's brooke davis.

13:01.050 --> 13:03.100
And you're mia catalano.

13:03.100 --> 13:05.010
But she's brooke davis.

13:05.010 --> 13:08.450
And you're mia catalano,and
I'm getting off this train.

13:10.280 --> 13:14.200
I just feel stupid --
like,everyone knew but me.

13:14.800 --> 13:16.240
All right,I can relate to you.

13:16.240 --> 13:19.960
Nathan lost hivirginity to my sister.

13:19.960 --> 13:21.650
Wow,you win.

13:21.650 --> 13:24.500
Look,I know the way chase looks at you.

13:24.500 --> 13:28.700
He probably didn't tell you because
he's not thinking about anybody but you.

13:29.830 --> 13:32.680
Now,chop-chop. Let's make a record.

13:48.550 --> 13:50.980
I am a high-school graduate,and
I can't read a freakin' map.

13:51.790 --> 13:58.110
Look,atlanta's just a straight shot down
74,to 95,to 20,to 75,to 85 -- 6 hours.

13:58.110 --> 14:00.130
Show-off.

14:02.300 --> 14:03.680
You too.

14:06.820 --> 14:09.800
And maybe if you would
have studied more instead of

14:09.800 --> 14:11.960
just making out with me in
the backseat of this car.

14:11.960 --> 14:15.610
No way. I got an a-plus in backseat.

14:16.340 --> 14:20.550
So,you're the only one with
one more graduation gift.

14:20.550 --> 14:22.520
And I was gonna wait to
tell you till I got to L.A.

14:22.520 --> 14:24.700
In case you freaked out,but...

14:25.180 --> 14:28.890
I sent copies of "unkindness of ravens"
to a bunch of publishers in new york.

14:29.240 --> 14:30.760
You thudded me.

14:30.760 --> 14:32.070
Payback.

14:32.070 --> 14:34.370
And right now,there's
some stuffy old publisher

14:34.370 --> 14:36.550
reading your words and
falling in love with them.

14:36.550 --> 14:39.870
And he's gonna buy
them,and he's gonna fly you

14:39.870 --> 14:42.180
to new york and make
you very,very famous.

14:42.940 --> 14:44.990
Thank you for doing that.

14:45.390 --> 14:47.280
I mean,I wanted to,but I just...

14:47.280 --> 14:49.020
you were afraid.

14:50.110 --> 14:51.160
I know.

14:51.160 --> 14:53.640
But someone once told
me your art matters,

14:53.640 --> 14:56.250
and I wonder who that was.

14:56.250 --> 14:57.820
I don't know.

14:57.820 --> 15:00.510
And you're not gonna get off that
easy with just a thank-you,either.

15:00.510 --> 15:03.390
I mean,when they turn your
brilliant novel into a movie,

15:03.390 --> 15:08.880
you are gonna have to cast,like,a
hot,rockin' body,kick-ass P.Sawyer.

15:09.540 --> 15:11.640
Yeah,only if I can play lucas.

15:20.520 --> 15:23.050
So,this julian
-- where is he?

15:23.050 --> 15:25.930
Los angeles,and I really
think she wanted to go.

15:25.930 --> 15:28.950
I know I did. It was the closest
I've ever come to a real family.

15:28.950 --> 15:30.120
I'm sorry she didn't think of you.

15:30.120 --> 15:31.450
My daughter can be quite selfish.

15:31.450 --> 15:33.450
Hey,no bagging on brooke. I told you.

15:33.450 --> 15:35.470
It's my "friendship with
the devil" deal-breaker.

15:37.560 --> 15:40.930
Really? You're following us?

15:40.930 --> 15:45.420
I know everything about retail and who
you should be watching,and it is not us.

15:45.420 --> 15:49.800
It's actually that girl over there about
to stuff that clutch into her knockoff.

15:51.260 --> 15:53.250
As for samantha...

15:54.300 --> 15:55.810
sorry about the shoplifting thing.

15:55.810 --> 15:58.740
It...won't happen again.

15:58.740 --> 16:00.490
Satisfied?

16:00.490 --> 16:02.210
Now you can go back to being completely

16:02.210 --> 16:05.660
and utterly incompetent at your job.

16:09.190 --> 16:11.400
Why are you such a bitch?

16:11.400 --> 16:12.730
This bitch just defended you.

16:12.730 --> 16:13.740
A thank-you would be nice.

16:13.740 --> 16:16.030
Thank you. Now,why are you such a bitch?

16:16.520 --> 16:17.920
Maybe I get a high from it.

16:17.920 --> 16:19.640
You know what? I stopped shoplifting.

16:19.640 --> 16:22.050
Maybe you could stopbeing so mean.

16:33.350 --> 16:34.440
I said no bonding.

16:34.440 --> 16:36.920
I told victoria to keep her
old-lady talons away from sam,

16:36.920 --> 16:41.130
and then there they were,having a
freakin' tree hill shopping-palooza.

16:41.130 --> 16:42.700
Look at her face. She's so smug.

16:42.700 --> 16:44.690
I just want to throw that
magazine across the room.

16:44.690 --> 16:48.900
Okay,um,maybe it is
because I'm hormonal,

16:48.900 --> 16:51.790
or maybe it's because I've been
lock in this room for so long,

16:51.790 --> 16:53.850
I have completely lost
touch with reality,

16:53.850 --> 16:57.960
but is it the worst thing in the
world for momzilla to be nice to sam?

16:57.960 --> 16:59.800
- Yes.
- Okay,what if she hated her?

16:59.800 --> 17:01.050
Wouldn't that be worse?

17:01.050 --> 17:02.670
Yes,but...

17:04.339 --> 17:06.599
...she never took me shopping.

17:17.270 --> 17:18.609
Am I interrupting?

17:18.609 --> 17:22.900
No,just looking awho I can
pull up to take your place.

17:23.609 --> 17:24.839
Devon.

17:24.839 --> 17:27.720
Did you come here to talk to me
about devon or the european offer?

17:29.160 --> 17:31.120
Both,actually.

17:31.520 --> 17:35.190
- But first,I need to ask you a question.
- Okay.

17:36.680 --> 17:39.780
Do you think I'm good
enough to make it to the nba?

17:41.150 --> 17:43.000
Are you good enough?

17:43.600 --> 17:45.810
Yes,nathan,you're good enough.

17:45.810 --> 17:47.990
But it takes more than talent.

17:48.420 --> 17:51.000
It takes timing and luck.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.920
Look,you have an offer on the table,

17:52.920 --> 17:57.590
and a two-year contract to play
professional ball does not come often.

17:58.780 --> 18:00.890
So you think I should take it.

18:00.890 --> 18:03.030
Yes,I do.

18:11.510 --> 18:12.600
Yeah,no,that's really great.

18:12.600 --> 18:15.030
- I think that adjustment helps a lot.
- Cool.

18:15.030 --> 18:16.720
Sounded good to me.

18:17.270 --> 18:18.500
Sorry to interrupt.

18:18.500 --> 18:21.240
The recording light wasn't
on,so I thought I'd just come in.

18:21.240 --> 18:23.590
You're nick lachey.

18:23.590 --> 18:25.840
And you're mia catalano.

18:26.850 --> 18:28.650
See? I told you.

18:29.280 --> 18:34.000
So,what's a guy got to do to
get your song on his album?

18:39.840 --> 18:43.760
When the label said they had an artist who
was interested in recording one of my songs,

18:43.760 --> 18:45.490
- I really -- -
didn't picture me.

18:45.490 --> 18:47.100
Yeah,at all.

18:47.100 --> 18:49.110
Nick lachey.

18:49.750 --> 18:51.800
You really love using
first and last names.

18:51.800 --> 18:52.960
It's a tree hill thing.

18:52.960 --> 18:54.210
Sorry,nick lachey.

18:54.210 --> 18:56.360
- Okay,just go.
- Bye.

18:58.210 --> 19:00.000
So,what are the magic words?

19:00.000 --> 19:02.020
'Cause I really want you to say yes.

19:02.020 --> 19:06.490
Your song is great,and trust me -- I've
listened to a lot of new songs for this album.

19:06.490 --> 19:07.590
Yeah,I'm --
I'm sorry.

19:07.590 --> 19:09.630
It's just that "all in my head"
wasn't supposed to be one of them.

19:09.630 --> 19:11.570
The labeljust screwed up.

19:11.570 --> 19:13.680
I'm glad they did.

19:14.320 --> 19:17.220
I really am flattered that
you came all the way out here,

19:17.220 --> 19:20.720
but there are no magic
words.The answer is just no.

19:21.860 --> 19:25.970
What if I told you I had
a really rough flight?

19:25.970 --> 19:27.810
Standby.

19:27.810 --> 19:29.340
Middle seat.

19:29.340 --> 19:31.380
Coach.

19:34.160 --> 19:35.830
I'm sorry.

19:35.830 --> 19:38.880
I'm just not interested
in selling my music.

19:40.200 --> 19:42.390
Oh,but would you sign this for my son?

19:42.390 --> 19:45.070
He's a big fan. His name's jamie.

19:52.640 --> 19:56.090
Can you believe that nathan and
haley are married with a baby?

19:57.160 --> 19:58.340
Yeah.

19:58.340 --> 20:01.500
Think ey were ready to get married
and have a baby on their second date.

20:01.980 --> 20:03.550
I think they did.

20:05.960 --> 20:08.910
I really hate that I'm gonna
miss jamie getting bigger.

20:08.910 --> 20:10.350
I mean,by the time I come home to visit,

20:10.350 --> 20:12.900
he's already gonna be
walking and talking.

20:12.900 --> 20:17.290
Nah,with nathan and haley,he'll
be reading and dribbling first.

20:17.290 --> 20:20.160
They are gonna be amazing parents.

20:20.640 --> 20:23.180
And you are gonna be an amazing mom.

20:23.180 --> 20:26.180
You should have that one day.

20:26.250 --> 20:28.260
And you will.

20:31.310 --> 20:33.860
'Whats chuck got that I don't?

20:33.860 --> 20:37.200
Better timing,a date with madison.

20:39.050 --> 20:40.430
I don't get it.

20:40.430 --> 20:43.810
I thought me and madison
had an unspoken connection.

20:43.810 --> 20:47.060
Look,nothing is unspoken with women.

20:47.490 --> 20:50.320
Now,you can't let this thing with
madison ruin the dance tonight.

20:50.320 --> 20:53.620
It's not,'cause I'm not going.

20:55.430 --> 20:59.000
Jamie,you got to go to
your first dance,man.

20:59.000 --> 21:03.070
I mean,what happens at your first dance
becomes the building block of the rep

21:03.070 --> 21:05.770
that'll follow you all
the way through school.

21:06.030 --> 21:08.180
Me? My first dance?

21:08.180 --> 21:12.250
I walked in "antwon,"
but I left "skills.

21:12.250 --> 21:14.700
" So,what? You just
gonna sit on this couch?

21:14.700 --> 21:17.000
You sit around pouting about nanny deb.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.620
I'm gonna sit around
and pout about madison.

21:19.620 --> 21:22.160
Cool. You want to roll like I roll?

21:22.160 --> 21:26.020
Then I'm going to the dance...now.

21:55.090 --> 21:58.290

So,what are you gonna do now?

22:38.450 --> 22:40.460
Work harder.

22:40.560 --> 22:43.450
Try and get picked up and...

22:43.650 --> 22:45.590
if I do...

22:48.060 --> 22:51.350
...I'm gonna do things differently.

22:52.660 --> 22:55.500
Funny thing is,um...

22:55.600 --> 22:58.170
I told you not to throw your shot away,

22:58.260 --> 23:01.510
but I should have been
telling myself that.

23:04.110 --> 23:07.290
'Cause you only get one.

23:23.330 --> 23:25.250
sam?

23:27.790 --> 23:32.040
Well,the broom's not parked outside,so
I guess victoria's not here,either.

Maybe I'll do some filing.

24:10.520 --> 24:15.970
oh...my...god.

24:26.540 --> 24:28.330
Thank you.

24:28.880 --> 24:31.110
What?

24:31.250 --> 24:33.200
It amazes me how much you can eat.

24:33.460 --> 24:35.780
It's kind of like you're eating for two.

24:36.900 --> 24:38.370
Are you eating for two?

24:38.520 --> 24:42.340
Trust me,this will be just the tip
of the iceberg when I'm pregnant.

24:43.160 --> 24:45.040
And either way,you said
it was our last hurrah,

24:45.160 --> 24:50.010
so how can that not include
stopping for "world's best pie"?

24:50.300 --> 24:52.780
Which,by the way,how do you
think they determine that?

24:52.820 --> 24:55.800
Well,I'm -- I'm
sure they do studies.

24:55.900 --> 24:58.590
Damn good last-hurrah pie.

24:59.030 --> 25:05.540
The way I see it is,as soon as that car pulls
out for L.A.Tomorrow,I'm officially an adult,

25:05.620 --> 25:10.360
ich means no more being
spontaneous,no more shoveling pie.

25:10.520 --> 25:13.840
Well,if this really is our
last hurrah,how about we,uh...

25:14.030 --> 25:16.620
go out in style?

25:16.720 --> 25:18.400
We can'T.

25:18.530 --> 25:21.640
- Are you serious?
- Dine and dash.

25:21.780 --> 25:23.570
I dare you.

25:25.860 --> 25:28.020
I will see you on the outside.

25:36.540 --> 25:41.770
There's an extra $5 in it if
you run out behind me screaming.

25:46.130 --> 25:48.190
I can't believe we just did that!

25:48.360 --> 25:51.120
No,no!What are you doing?!

26:07.100 --> 26:08.580
suck,huh?

26:08.650 --> 26:10.780
Want to get out of here
and get some ice cream?

26:10.960 --> 26:14.190
Sorry,bro.I met someone.

26:16.840 --> 26:20.620
Aw,come on,now.There's a lot of girls
out there you could be having fun with.

26:21.790 --> 26:23.330
Why do I have to try?

26:23.470 --> 26:26.130
You're not.

26:28.240 --> 26:29.900
It's not the same thing.

26:29.970 --> 26:32.740
I know you like her.I
think you're chicken.

26:32.880 --> 26:34.290
I am not.

26:36.050 --> 26:38.130
Look,I'm not scared.

26:38.360 --> 26:39.900
Prove it.

26:53.260 --> 26:55.430
Hey,you're home.

26:55.530 --> 26:57.260
You missed jamie on
his way to the dance.

26:57.420 --> 26:58.850
He was so cute in his little suit!

26:58.970 --> 27:01.100
Looked like a little lucas.

27:03.180 --> 27:05.180
What's going on?

27:05.270 --> 27:08.540
I got an offer to play...in europe.

27:08.630 --> 27:12.220
And I don't know,hales,maybe
we should...consider it.

27:12.290 --> 27:14.460
It's good money.It's
a two-year contract.

27:14.580 --> 27:16.300
But you want to playin the nba.

27:16.400 --> 27:22.360
I know,but so does every other person on my
team and every other player in the "b" league.

27:23.480 --> 27:26.200
Okay,um...

27:27.070 --> 27:31.870
all right,let's say that you take this two-year
contract and then the nba comes calling.

27:31.950 --> 27:36.430
What if I don't take it
and then they never call?

27:36.540 --> 27:38.650
I mean,I've been working on this...

27:38.690 --> 27:43.250
comeback for a long time
now,and maybe this is my chance

27:43.370 --> 27:46.580
and I'm just too focused on
the fantasy of the nba tnotice.

27:46.620 --> 27:51.650
It's not a fantasy.That's your dream.

27:52.430 --> 27:54.980
Th to what end?

27:57.260 --> 27:59.610
I don't know.

28:00.060 --> 28:02.860
But whatever you decide,you have
a wife and a son who love you,

28:02.950 --> 28:05.720
and we're behind you 100%.

28:09.140 --> 28:11.110
Thanks.

28:17.920 --> 28:19.650
What do you call this again?

28:19.720 --> 28:21.160
The chaser.

28:21.290 --> 28:24.840
Really?'Cause it tastes just
likea bad long island iced tea.

28:25.520 --> 28:27.840
Why didn't you tell me you lost
your virginity to brooke davis?

28:27.910 --> 28:29.720
I didn'T.

28:29.730 --> 28:32.080
Why,did she say I was a virgin?

28:33.880 --> 28:36.130
Nice.

28:36.250 --> 28:38.340
Peyt told me,but it
should have been you.

28:38.510 --> 28:42.060
The losing-virginity topic really isn't
something a guy likes to bring up to his girl.

28:42.160 --> 28:46.450
Or himself.But,then again,your
premiere starred brooke davis.

28:46.570 --> 28:48.600
Stay out of it,nick lachey.

28:52.080 --> 28:55.150
So,what's brooke been up to,anyway?

29:06.340 --> 29:10.760
you have really out-bitched
yourself this time,victoria.

29:13.430 --> 29:15.770
Explain.

29:15.840 --> 29:17.580
Or no.Don't explain.

29:17.600 --> 29:22.910
I'm sure it'll just be more of the
same self-serving,manipulative B.S.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.900
Oh,just stop the histrionics.We
could lose samantha.

29:25.960 --> 29:28.510
"We"?She is not yours tlose.

29:28.610 --> 29:31.970
Samantha and i have gotten very
close,and that woman gave her up.

29:32.090 --> 29:36.320
She made her mistakes a long time ago,and
it's a little late to try to show up now.

29:37.320 --> 29:39.760
I'm sorry.Are you
kidding,or am I being punked?

29:39.880 --> 29:42.460
This is different.I never abandoned you.

29:42.510 --> 29:44.180
Not physically.

29:44.320 --> 29:46.370
And maybe that's worse.

29:46.490 --> 29:47.950
You think I'm so bad.

29:48.050 --> 29:50.220
I destroyed those
letters for you,brooke.

29:50.280 --> 29:51.900
I see how much samantha means to you.

29:51.980 --> 29:54.010
No.Don't do that.

29:54.090 --> 29:56.280
You have never done anything for me.

29:56.380 --> 30:00.080
This is about you trying to have
some half-assed do-over with sam

30:00.170 --> 30:02.240
because you screwed up
so completely with me,

30:02.240 --> 30:05.380
and it is so obvious
and so damn pathetic!

30:05.570 --> 30:07.720
Just stop!

30:09.170 --> 30:12.330
And you never took me shopping.

30:20.960 --> 30:22.860
Okay,wait.Just hear me out.

30:22.920 --> 30:24.930
You're just in time.

30:25.680 --> 30:26.940
For what?

30:27.050 --> 30:30.550
I have the instrumental track for
"all in my head" cued up.Go sing.

30:30.630 --> 30:34.530
- Now?
- Hey,joe perry said,"let the music do the talking.

30:34.620 --> 30:37.590
" An aerosmith reference.I
knew I liked you.

30:50.100 --> 30:54.550
* Satellites blasting
through the universe *

30:54.610 --> 30:59.320
* it's out of sight
it's all in my head *

30:59.460 --> 31:07.430
* saw your eyes sending me
a message for the last time *

31:08.730 --> 31:12.620
* here alone holding on to something *

31:12.800 --> 31:17.260
* that I've never known
it's all in my head  *

31:17.400 --> 31:18.890
I turned down the offer.

31:19.030 --> 31:20.500
Yeah,I know.

31:20.560 --> 31:22.990
I just got off the phone with the scout.

31:23.160 --> 31:25.960
- Nathan,I -- I'm
going to the nba,bobby.

31:26.030 --> 31:30.550
I was going to say that the european
league missed out on a great player.

31:30.820 --> 31:33.290
I hope the nba doesn'T.

31:33.450 --> 31:35.740
Thank you.

31:35.960 --> 31:41.000
Oh,and I want you to know I
told the scout about devon.

31:41.090 --> 31:42.990
He's a good player.He
just made a mistake,

31:43.010 --> 31:46.810
and that doesn't mean he
shouldn't get a second chance.

31:47.050 --> 31:49.840
I told the scout the same thing.

31:49.920 --> 31:52.220
I'll see you in practice tomorrow,scott.

31:52.280 --> 31:55.560
I'll see you at practice.

31:59.680 --> 32:02.700
antwon "skills" taylor
crashing a 5-year-olds' dance?

32:02.900 --> 32:04.970
I was hoping to see you.

32:05.950 --> 32:09.170
I wanted to ask you out,but i
was kind of hesitant because...

32:09.340 --> 32:11.620
I just got out of a relationship.

32:11.710 --> 32:14.440
Me too.Bad break-up.

32:14.550 --> 32:17.010
It broke my heart.

32:17.190 --> 32:21.230
So I guess neither one of us should
really be dating right now,huh?

32:21.440 --> 32:23.920
Probably not.

32:24.210 --> 32:27.050
So,you want to dance?

32:27.200 --> 32:29.420
No.

32:30.190 --> 32:33.550
But I could go for
some rebound s-e-X.

32:36.010 --> 32:40.400
I'm kiddin a dance would be nice.

32:41.840 --> 32:46.280
* Someone wake me up when she
calls me when she calls me *

32:46.440 --> 32:49.270
* it's like I've been
asleep since she's gone *

32:49.300 --> 32:51.000
* I can't believe that she's gone *

32:51.100 --> 32:55.480
* someone let her know
I'm not breathing  *

32:55.600 --> 32:57.890
* telme this isn't happening *

32:58.000 --> 33:01.440
* tell me this isn't happening *

33:01.550 --> 33:12.120
* all in my head all in my head
all in my head all in my head *

33:16.620 --> 33:17.720
it was good.

33:17.790 --> 33:20.480
It was great --
the song,I mean.

33:20.620 --> 33:22.640
I know.

33:23.770 --> 33:26.050
Okay,I'll let you record it.

33:26.120 --> 33:29.200
One condition --
I want to produce.

33:33.970 --> 33:35.650
Sorry I've been sneaking
around with your mom.

33:35.800 --> 33:37.380
It's just...

33:37.540 --> 33:40.040
she's not that bad once you get
past the royal bitch of it all.

33:40.170 --> 33:42.650
No,she's worse.

33:42.810 --> 33:45.300
You know,she'd really
like another chance.

33:45.310 --> 33:48.300
SaM...

33:48.770 --> 33:51.690
I have a letter for you.

33:52.370 --> 33:54.720
...From your birth mother.

33:57.630 --> 33:59.690
I guess she's been
sending them to the store,

33:59.770 --> 34:03.160
hoping that I could help
her get in touch with you,

34:03.190 --> 34:07.130
and somehow they ended up in junk mail.

34:07.260 --> 34:09.670
Yeah,I don't want it.

34:09.920 --> 34:11.940
- SaM.
- No,she gave me up.

34:11.969 --> 34:13.670
She doesn't want me,right?

34:13.710 --> 34:16.159
What does she want
now?To say she's sorry?

34:16.340 --> 34:18.130
Maybe.

34:18.260 --> 34:20.000
Well,then,she should have said it.

34:20.100 --> 34:23.360
Every time I sat there in that
coffee shop right in front of her...

34:25.150 --> 34:27.949
she didn't even know
that was her own daughter.

34:30.949 --> 34:32.850
So,screw her and her "I'm sorrys"

34:32.940 --> 34:36.020
because all that ever
got me was a sucky life.

34:36.409 --> 34:39.380
And there's nothing she
could say to fix that.

34:40.120 --> 34:43.760
Samantha,you've been going to
that coffee shop for months.

34:44.630 --> 34:51.400
You must want something from
her,e-even if it's just closure.

34:52.090 --> 34:54.900
Okay.

34:55.360 --> 34:58.410
How about why?

34:58.710 --> 35:00.630
Why wasn't I good enough?

35:02.150 --> 35:05.430
Why didn't she love me enough?

35:06.990 --> 35:10.160
Why could she just throw me away?

35:13.330 --> 35:16.010
Maybe...

35:16.060 --> 35:22.570
maybe she wants to tell you why giving you up
was the hardest thing that she ever had to do.

35:24.990 --> 35:28.550
Sweetheart,I have no idea how you feel.

35:29.310 --> 35:33.930
Even on her worst day,victoria
never gave me away,

35:34.040 --> 35:37.580
but if you want to know why,

35:37.740 --> 35:41.300
she's the only person who
can answer that for you.

36:00.690 --> 36:03.480
******

36:13.620 --> 36:16.590
I should have told you about brooke.

36:18.350 --> 36:21.280
Did you love her?

36:21.420 --> 36:24.100
Thought I did.

36:26.030 --> 36:29.570
That's before I fell in love with you.

36:42.990 --> 36:45.960
madison's been talking
about you all night.

36:46.070 --> 36:48.720
Really?

36:49.010 --> 36:50.660
I'm sorry I hosed you,man.

36:50.750 --> 36:53.870
She's waiting for you over there.

37:03.210 --> 37:06.090
no.

37:24.880 --> 37:28.390
*

37:30.070 --> 37:32.460
Hello?

37:32.600 --> 37:34.900
This is he.

37:36.900 --> 37:38.660
Yes,sir.

37:38.660 --> 37:41.070
A tryout.

37:41.400 --> 37:43.540
Yes,sir.

37:43.640 --> 37:46.010
All rit,thank you.

37:46.360 --> 37:49.210
Babe...a tryout!

37:49.490 --> 37:52.800
Oh,god.

37:53.630 --> 37:56.980
What if I just gave away my last chance?

37:58.100 --> 38:00.770
Your chancis coming,baby.

38:00.960 --> 38:03.820
I really believe that.

38:22.990 --> 38:25.570
I'm gonna be right here.

38:27.900 --> 38:30.150
it's okay.

39:07.900 --> 39:09.910
peyton.

39:12.340 --> 39:14.550
Close your eyes.

39:14.900 --> 39:18.670
I knew you had a surprise for me.

39:20.850 --> 39:23.760
Open your eyes.

39:24.860 --> 39:27.460
Where did you find this?

39:27.560 --> 39:31.600
It's the best concert we never went to.

39:31.680 --> 39:34.960
I still can't believe you pretended
to like the cure all those years.

39:35.220 --> 39:37.140
I never said I loved the cure.

39:37.190 --> 39:40.530
I said I loved kissing you to the cure.

39:40.940 --> 39:43.910
This was one of the
best days of my life.

39:44.200 --> 39:46.970
Really good pie.

39:48.040 --> 39:51.460
We had our whole lives in front of us.

39:55.610 --> 39:58.240
We still do.

39:59.600 --> 40:03.050
I know.

40:05.050 --> 40:09.010
Well,the cure is
playing.Where's my kissing?

40:25.810 --> 40:29.540
I can't believe I kept those
tickets for six months...

40:30.240 --> 40:32.020
...And I lost them in six hours.

40:32.630 --> 40:37.730
You know what?Maybe we can just go back to the
doorman and explain that we really did have two.

40:37.860 --> 40:39.460
Yeah,yeah.

40:39.530 --> 40:42.700
I'm kind of thinking he's
probably heard that one before.

40:43.460 --> 40:45.630
I'm sorry about the concert.

40:45.640 --> 40:48.770
Who goes to a sold-out show anyway?

40:48.870 --> 40:52.610
And besides,I only have
one last night with you.

40:52.670 --> 40:56.560
Unless you show up tomorrow
with,like,another surprise.

40:56.640 --> 40:59.730
If that's what it takes
to keep you from leaving.

41:03.380 --> 41:06.070
I'm gonna miss you.

41:06.120 --> 41:07.540
You better...

41:07.620 --> 41:11.130
'cause I have a lot of
dreams wrapped up in yo

41:11.150 --> 41:14.710
and it's kind of hard to have a
happily ever after all by yourself.

41:15.070 --> 41:17.080
And we're gonna have that,lucas.

41:17.160 --> 41:19.760
We are gonna get married,

41:19.780 --> 41:24.290
and we're gonna make a lot of
babies in the backseat of this car.

41:26.750 --> 41:28.490
I promise.

41:28.600 --> 41:30.570
And I always keep my promises.

41:30.620 --> 41:34.390
Good...'cause I'm gonna hold you to it.
