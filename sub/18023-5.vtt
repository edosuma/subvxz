WEBVTT

00:05.255 --> 00:07.423
We got up the river,
and those fish,

00:07.424 --> 00:08.757
had gotten on the ledge,

00:08.758 --> 00:10.676
right at ninety degree turn.

00:10.677 --> 00:14.054
We literally caught
a bass every cast.

00:14.055 --> 00:16.515
That's about like
when I caught about...

00:16.516 --> 00:19.185
forty in about ten seconds.

00:21.229 --> 00:23.021
In a net?

00:23.022 --> 00:24.857
Yeah, net.

00:24.858 --> 00:26.567
That's not fishing.
That's illegal.

00:26.568 --> 00:27.444
Oh no, that is fishing.

00:27.445 --> 00:28.777
Yeah, that's illegal.

00:28.778 --> 00:29.696
That's illegal.

00:29.696 --> 00:30.613
Well, I'll put it this way,

00:30.614 --> 00:31.614
that's my kind of fishing.

00:31.614 --> 00:32.532
You broke the law.

00:32.533 --> 00:33.615
All right, here we go.

00:33.616 --> 00:35.451
Hup, two-three-four...

00:35.452 --> 00:36.952
What do you go tin
the blanket ther, son?

00:36.953 --> 00:38.370
A prize right here.

00:38.371 --> 00:40.622
What is that?

00:40.623 --> 00:42.833
Dude, I've added to my arsenal.

00:42.834 --> 00:44.376
Check this out.

00:44.377 --> 00:46.463
That's my rifle.

00:46.921 --> 00:48.005
No, this is mine.

00:48.006 --> 00:50.340
That's pa's old
rifle that he gave to me.

00:50.341 --> 00:52.885
No, actually,
dad said I could have it.

00:52.886 --> 00:54.261
It's cool, isn't it?

00:54.262 --> 00:57.347
My grandpa, who we called pa,

00:57.348 --> 01:00.058
was a man of very few words.

01:00.059 --> 01:03.353
But some of those few
words he uttered were,

01:03.354 --> 01:06.523
"Jase, this rifle is yours."

01:06.524 --> 01:09.610
Pa said if I fixed it,
I could keep it.

01:09.611 --> 01:10.944
I was the only one
doing the hunting,

01:10.945 --> 01:12.822
you weren't even born.

01:13.782 --> 01:15.073
But what's that matter?

01:15.074 --> 01:16.575
All that matters!

01:16.576 --> 01:19.536
If you're not on the planet,
you're disqualified.

01:19.537 --> 01:23.415
Youngest brothers are
entitled to two things.

01:23.416 --> 01:24.583
This is mine now.

01:24.584 --> 01:27.085
Left overs and hand me downs.

01:27.086 --> 01:28.504
He passed it down to his son,

01:28.505 --> 01:30.005
my dad passed it to me.

01:30.006 --> 01:32.508
No, he passed
to his son, which is me.

01:32.509 --> 01:34.426
No, I'm his son.

01:34.427 --> 01:36.637
Typical Jep, trying to mess with

01:36.638 --> 01:39.515
a promise from the grave.

01:39.516 --> 01:41.058
You're not doing
this to me again.

01:41.059 --> 01:42.601
I mean, it's gonna
be kind of hard

01:42.602 --> 01:44.394
to prove that.

01:44.395 --> 01:45.729
That things needs
some oil-

01:45.730 --> 01:47.022
I know where it came from.

01:47.023 --> 01:48.148
Hey.

01:48.149 --> 01:49.608
You should worry
about where it's fix to go,

01:49.609 --> 01:50.609
which is in my hands.

01:50.610 --> 01:52.194
Fellas, one time I'd like to

01:52.195 --> 01:54.655
come in and everybody
be working.

01:54.656 --> 01:57.867
- Do what?
- Work.

01:59.536 --> 02:00.954
We gotta work.

02:02.121 --> 02:04.039
Hey, that's worth
fifteen dollars

02:04.040 --> 02:05.040
when you put it in a box.

02:05.041 --> 02:06.333
No, I think those
are like thirty.

02:06.334 --> 02:07.417
No, those are more than that.

02:07.418 --> 02:08.627
Oh, they more than that?

02:08.628 --> 02:10.338
Well, hey, I'd give
you fifteen for it.

02:10.713 --> 02:12.256
Jep, what are
you doing with my rifle?

02:12.257 --> 02:13.841
That's actually mine.

02:13.842 --> 02:14.925
That's my rifle.
Phil gave it to me.

02:14.926 --> 02:17.553
Jep said Phil gave it to him.

02:17.554 --> 02:18.179
He did.

02:18.180 --> 02:19.304
When?

02:19.305 --> 02:20.347
He just gave it to me.

02:20.348 --> 02:21.598
It is a family hierloom,

02:21.599 --> 02:22.599
and I'm keeping it.

02:22.600 --> 02:23.767
I think you
should let an unbiased

02:23.768 --> 02:25.102
party hold the gun.

02:25.103 --> 02:26.062
Here you go.

02:26.063 --> 02:27.229
Let an unbiased
party hold that gun.

02:27.230 --> 02:29.022
No, here's what we do.
We have a competition.

02:29.023 --> 02:30.274
No!

02:30.275 --> 02:32.150
Why is everything a competition?

02:32.151 --> 02:33.694
I'm starting to
feel that the only reason

02:33.695 --> 02:35.696
that our family has so
many competitions,

02:35.697 --> 02:38.365
is because nobody in the duck
call room wants to work.

02:38.366 --> 02:40.242
Let's have a shooting
competition...

02:40.243 --> 02:41.451
between me and Jep.

02:41.452 --> 02:43.620
Whoever wins, gets the rifle.

02:43.621 --> 02:45.372
Why can't they compete about how

02:45.373 --> 02:46.707
many duck calls they can make?

02:46.708 --> 02:48.625
Or how many pies
they could bring me.

02:48.626 --> 02:50.210
You know, the important stuff.

02:50.211 --> 02:51.628
Instead, it's like,
let's see who could

02:51.629 --> 02:53.422
eat the most marshmallows.

02:53.423 --> 02:54.882
Hey, can ya'll edit the
last part out?

02:54.883 --> 02:57.050
Because I don't want to
give them any ideas.

02:57.051 --> 02:58.510
Especially about marshmallows.

02:58.511 --> 02:59.928
All right, all right, guys!

02:59.929 --> 03:02.890
Nobody is having a
shooting competition.

03:02.891 --> 03:05.142
I need this order done,
ASAP, okay.

03:05.143 --> 03:06.226
Fine.

03:06.227 --> 03:07.686
We'll settle
who gets the rifle later.

03:07.687 --> 03:09.313
Put that gun up,
it's distracting.

03:09.314 --> 03:10.398
Si, do some work.

03:11.900 --> 03:12.941
That works.

03:12.942 --> 03:14.902
All right, here's what we do.

03:14.903 --> 03:16.194
We shoot skeet, whoever wins,

03:16.195 --> 03:17.321
gets the rifle.

03:17.322 --> 03:18.114
All right.

03:18.114 --> 03:18.781
Agreed?

03:18.782 --> 03:19.907
Agreed.

03:19.908 --> 03:21.033
And after that, we can have

03:21.034 --> 03:22.284
a spelling competition.

03:22.285 --> 03:23.327
I'm in for that.

03:23.328 --> 03:26.664
Si, you can't even
spell competition.

03:40.345 --> 03:41.762
Hey, my mom wanted to say

03:41.763 --> 03:43.806
hi to everybody.

03:44.182 --> 03:46.267
Rebecca, every time-
She only speaks Chinese.

03:47.268 --> 03:49.354
Well, you should've
learned some by now.

03:54.025 --> 03:55.442
Rebecca came here
as an exchange student,

03:55.443 --> 03:56.610
she just never went
back to Taiwan.

03:56.611 --> 03:58.278
We didn't officially adopt her,

03:58.279 --> 04:01.239
but we are her American family.

04:01.240 --> 04:02.450
It was for tax reasons.

04:06.996 --> 04:08.747
Korie is my American mom.

04:08.748 --> 04:10.165
And my dad passed away when

04:10.166 --> 04:12.876
I was younger,
so Willie is really,

04:12.877 --> 04:15.838
kind of like my only
father few-ger.

04:18.675 --> 04:21.052
I knew I could not say that.

04:24.222 --> 04:25.347
What are you saying?

04:25.348 --> 04:27.057
We're going to Taiwan
in two days.

04:27.058 --> 04:28.308
Oh, that's right.

04:28.309 --> 04:29.518
Ya'll fixing to see each other.

04:29.519 --> 04:31.853
So, I'm going to Taiwan because

04:31.854 --> 04:35.023
I got engaged on
New Year's Eve last-

04:35.024 --> 04:36.775
Was it last year?
Yeah, it was last year.

04:36.776 --> 04:38.026
Oh, there's the city.

04:38.027 --> 04:39.695
- Look at that.
- Wow!

04:39.696 --> 04:41.613
Okay, buh-bye.
Oh, we're not-

04:41.614 --> 04:42.614
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

04:42.615 --> 04:43.740
I was just gonna say that.

04:43.741 --> 04:45.993
So, I'm bringing John Reed
to meet my

04:45.994 --> 04:47.577
family in Taiwan.

04:47.578 --> 04:49.329
I'm kind of nervous,
cause I don't really

04:49.330 --> 04:51.873
know what to expect,
and there's a lot of

04:51.874 --> 04:54.084
tradition I'm not
really familiar with.

04:54.085 --> 04:56.378
So, I don't know what to do.

04:56.379 --> 04:57.379
Just wing it.

04:57.380 --> 04:59.756
That's your advice?
Just wing it?

04:59.757 --> 05:01.216
That's what I did
for our wedding

05:01.217 --> 05:02.760
and look how that turned out.

05:03.344 --> 05:04.679
Yeah.

05:05.263 --> 05:10.726
Bye.

05:10.727 --> 05:11.977
Bye.

05:11.978 --> 05:14.730
Aw, that was fun.
>> That was awesome.

05:14.731 --> 05:15.939
Bye.

05:15.940 --> 05:17.524
Close it, Rebecca.

05:17.525 --> 05:18.317
Close it.

05:18.318 --> 05:19.401
- >> Aw.
- Bye.

05:19.402 --> 05:20.444
She's excited
about you all coming.

05:20.445 --> 05:21.570
Just close the computer.

05:21.571 --> 05:22.696
Okay, I guess
I'll just close the computer.

05:22.697 --> 05:23.864
What she say?

05:23.865 --> 05:25.907
Basically, she said,
"I hope you're enjoying

05:25.908 --> 05:29.828
your prepare for the
engagement ceremony."

05:29.829 --> 05:31.288
Engagement ceremony?

05:31.289 --> 05:34.666
Yeah, like in Taiwan
traditional wedding,

05:34.667 --> 05:37.669
the family has to approve
first basically.

05:37.670 --> 05:39.546
Oh!

05:39.547 --> 05:40.547
So, it's like a task.

05:40.548 --> 05:41.590
Are ya'll prepared for that?

05:41.591 --> 05:42.674
Uh...

05:42.675 --> 05:44.926
Maybe we should like, practice.

05:44.927 --> 05:47.220
Don't worry, we will help you.

05:47.221 --> 05:48.847
Okay, thank you.

05:48.848 --> 05:51.349
We like, "we are?"
We...

05:51.350 --> 05:53.101
We.
Like, we.

05:53.102 --> 05:56.104
You have to be here,
we're practicing on you.

05:56.105 --> 05:57.439
Suck it up, buttercup.

05:57.440 --> 05:59.024
You signed up for that when
you became a father.

05:59.025 --> 06:01.694
Oh!

06:02.236 --> 06:04.404
Did he just say,
"Suck it up, buttercup?"

06:04.405 --> 06:08.700
Pipe down there, Rowdy.

06:08.701 --> 06:10.870
[Ock music]

06:14.499 --> 06:16.500
All right, ladies and gentlemen.

06:16.501 --> 06:17.376
Si.

06:17.377 --> 06:18.418
What?

06:18.419 --> 06:20.087
There are no ladies here.

06:20.088 --> 06:21.005
Okay.

06:21.006 --> 06:22.672
Redneck and whatever,

06:22.673 --> 06:25.008
or whoever else is
assembled here today,

06:25.009 --> 06:27.552
welcome to the First
Annual Robertson Family

06:27.553 --> 06:29.430
Shooting Competition.

06:30.640 --> 06:32.183
There you go.

06:33.101 --> 06:34.726
Jep and I are having a skeet

06:34.727 --> 06:36.686
shooting competition
to settle who gets

06:36.687 --> 06:38.605
out grandpa's rifle.

06:38.606 --> 06:39.689
All right, look, question.

06:39.690 --> 06:41.399
He has a twenty gage,
I have a twenty eight,

06:41.400 --> 06:43.693
so I feel like should
get extra points.

06:43.694 --> 06:44.820
You wouldn't have
lived ten minutes

06:44.821 --> 06:46.029
in the wild west.

06:46.030 --> 06:48.365
The only reason I'm
agreeing to do this,

06:48.366 --> 06:50.242
is cause I know that
I'm gonna win.

06:50.243 --> 06:51.368
Are they both shotguns?

06:51.369 --> 06:52.203
Yeah.

06:52.204 --> 06:54.162
That qualifies for the rules.

06:54.163 --> 06:55.997
I really don't know the rules.

06:55.998 --> 06:57.124
I don't either.

06:57.125 --> 06:59.167
There are no rules.
First shooter up.

06:59.168 --> 07:00.252
And hey, don't forget,

07:00.253 --> 07:01.837
the winner actually
gets my rifle.

07:01.838 --> 07:04.339
It's not your rifle, Si.

07:04.340 --> 07:06.341
It's literally, like take candy

07:06.342 --> 07:08.052
from a baby.

07:08.469 --> 07:09.469
Pull.

07:24.652 --> 07:26.528
Oh!

07:26.529 --> 07:28.489
Now we got the rabbit.

07:29.198 --> 07:30.241
Pull.

07:38.791 --> 07:41.376
Advantage, older brother.

07:41.377 --> 07:42.586
Nice, job, nice job.

07:42.587 --> 07:43.379
Any more questions?

07:43.379 --> 07:44.172
Let's go.

07:44.173 --> 07:45.380
If you gonna talk, talk.

07:45.381 --> 07:47.048
If you gonna shoot, shoot.

07:47.049 --> 07:48.049
Pull.

07:49.510 --> 07:50.969
Look at that 28 go, boys.

07:50.970 --> 07:52.220
I'm already at a disadvantage

07:52.221 --> 07:53.346
with my shotgun,

07:53.347 --> 07:54.974
but I'm pretty sure
I can take Jase.

07:55.558 --> 07:58.269
I'm younger, faster,
and more agile.

08:02.815 --> 08:04.358
Fancy pants.

08:05.276 --> 08:06.569
Seven to wreck.

08:06.861 --> 08:07.861
Pull.

08:11.115 --> 08:12.195
Hey, hey, coming at cha!

08:14.035 --> 08:15.660
Wow!
That's recovery!

08:15.661 --> 08:17.871
I do play a lot
of FPS video games.

08:17.872 --> 08:19.623
And Jess is always
saying it's a complete

08:19.624 --> 08:20.917
waste of time.

08:23.544 --> 08:26.047
But if I win this competition,
and prove her wrong...

08:27.715 --> 08:28.507
Quit kissing on your gun

08:28.507 --> 08:29.467
and get ready.

08:29.468 --> 08:31.176
That would be awesome.

08:31.177 --> 08:32.178
Pull.

08:35.264 --> 08:36.681
Woo!

08:36.682 --> 08:39.601
May I have my rifle, please?

08:39.602 --> 08:40.894
Where's the rifle?

08:40.895 --> 08:42.854
Jase, it ain't over yet, son.

08:42.855 --> 08:44.022
Part two of the
rifle competition is

08:44.023 --> 08:45.690
the rifle shoot off.

08:45.691 --> 08:47.692
What?
Wait a minute now.

08:47.693 --> 08:48.860
Well I mean, if you're scared,

08:48.861 --> 08:50.528
say you're scared.

08:50.529 --> 08:51.529
Oh, I'm not sacred.

08:51.530 --> 08:52.697
I will beat you at shotguns,

08:52.698 --> 08:54.032
I will beat you at rifles.

08:54.033 --> 08:55.909
If it takes slingshots,
we'll do that next.

08:55.910 --> 08:57.077
And ya'll don't need to

08:57.078 --> 08:59.580
be so quick at taking
spelling off the table.

09:02.583 --> 09:04.918
Time for the
ceremonial hand washing.

09:04.919 --> 09:06.336
What am I suppose to do?

09:06.337 --> 09:08.171
Carry the wash bath with water,

09:08.172 --> 09:10.006
and let him wash
and wipe his hands.

09:10.007 --> 09:12.175
This ritual means, we like you,

09:12.176 --> 09:14.386
but just saying,
we don't know where

09:14.387 --> 09:15.554
your hands have been.

09:16.514 --> 09:17.597
Rebecca and John Reed

09:17.598 --> 09:19.849
were recently engaged here
in the United States.

09:19.850 --> 09:22.519
But according to Rebecca's
mom and family in Taiwan,

09:22.520 --> 09:24.729
they are not officially
engaged until they

09:24.730 --> 09:26.856
go through the
traditional Taiwanese

09:26.857 --> 09:28.400
engagement custom.

09:28.401 --> 09:30.694
So before they leave,
we're helping them practice

09:30.695 --> 09:32.737
so they'll be prepared
for the ceremony.

09:32.738 --> 09:35.031
Even though we don't know
what the ceremony is,

09:35.032 --> 09:37.117
Korie just pulled
a list from the internet.

09:37.118 --> 09:39.411
I'm sure it'll be fine.

09:39.412 --> 09:40.620
Do you have the red envelope?

09:40.621 --> 09:41.746
Am I suppose to give to ya'll,

09:41.747 --> 09:42.872
or who am I suppose
to give it to?

09:42.873 --> 09:43.957
Yeah.

09:43.958 --> 09:45.834
Let's see, how much I'm worth.

09:45.835 --> 09:47.003
Big money.

09:48.379 --> 09:51.172
There's three dollars and
an ice cream gift card.

09:51.173 --> 09:52.173
I'll take the gift card.

09:52.174 --> 09:53.050
You can keep the whole thing,

09:53.051 --> 09:54.510
there's nothing in it.

09:55.177 --> 09:56.095
It's all right.

09:56.096 --> 09:57.178
I didn't really warn
him before this.

09:57.179 --> 09:58.513
I think it's just suppose
to be symbolic.

09:58.514 --> 09:59.473
Three hundred years ago,

09:59.474 --> 10:00.557
they'd probably
given like a couple

10:00.558 --> 10:01.599
of goats or something.

10:01.600 --> 10:02.976
Yeah.
They do pigs...

10:02.977 --> 10:03.853
I thought they did animals.

10:03.853 --> 10:04.562
A cow.

10:04.563 --> 10:05.687
So give them a cow.

10:05.688 --> 10:06.688
You can make a lot of steaks

10:06.689 --> 10:07.856
out of one cow.

10:07.857 --> 10:10.191
Can you kill a buck,
and then I can bring it?

10:10.192 --> 10:13.404
I don't think you ship
a dead buck to Taiwan.

10:14.071 --> 10:16.323
Okay, now it's time
for the tea ceremony.

10:16.324 --> 10:17.824
Me and John Reed met during

10:17.825 --> 10:19.701
Voodoo Fest in New Orleans.

10:19.702 --> 10:22.329
I'm really impressed
with how John Reed

10:22.330 --> 10:25.498
gets along my family here,

10:25.499 --> 10:27.834
but it's also important
to know the other

10:27.835 --> 10:30.337
side of me that's in Taiwan.

10:30.338 --> 10:32.839
Here's to red envelopes,

10:32.840 --> 10:35.508
with more cash than that's
got in it for sure,

10:35.509 --> 10:36.926
and engagement and
a happy wedding.

10:36.927 --> 10:38.637
Cheers.

10:39.639 --> 10:40.847
I'm really nervous for John Reed

10:40.848 --> 10:42.182
to meet the family.

10:42.183 --> 10:46.019
I don't think he
realizes how crazy my

10:46.020 --> 10:49.230
family can be in Taiwan.

10:49.231 --> 10:50.357
It'll be all right.

10:50.358 --> 10:51.608
I think he'll do fine,

10:51.609 --> 10:54.528
but you just need
to be prepared.

10:54.987 --> 10:56.279
Yeah.

10:56.280 --> 10:57.364
Yup.

10:57.365 --> 10:58.365
I'm gonna go shoot fireworks.

10:58.366 --> 10:59.824
Actually, I'm gonna go with him.

10:59.825 --> 11:01.576
Oh no.

11:01.577 --> 11:05.664
We should probably stay inside.

11:12.338 --> 11:13.380
All right, lets
get this competition

11:13.381 --> 11:14.672
over with, boys.

11:14.673 --> 11:16.049
You think you
got those barrels far

11:16.050 --> 11:17.175
enough out there?

11:17.176 --> 11:18.551
Three hundred yards.

11:18.552 --> 11:20.345
Three hundred yards?

11:20.346 --> 11:22.347
I sighted this gun
in at fifty yards.

11:22.348 --> 11:26.018
I'm saying move the
barrels a bit closer.

11:26.310 --> 11:27.103
No.

11:27.104 --> 11:28.478
This is long range shooting.

11:28.479 --> 11:29.729
You got three on the left,

11:29.730 --> 11:31.022
I've got the three on the right.

11:31.023 --> 11:32.023
And trust me, you wanna hit the

11:32.024 --> 11:33.358
ones in the middle,

11:33.359 --> 11:36.194
because I got a
little something in there.

11:36.195 --> 11:39.114
That's a nice little
pencil gun you got there.

11:39.115 --> 11:40.908
I brought me a little something.

11:41.450 --> 11:43.076
This is ol' Ronda here.

11:43.077 --> 11:44.828
I'm betting on Jep.

11:44.829 --> 11:46.372
Anybody wanna take Jase?

11:47.248 --> 11:48.874
No.

11:49.291 --> 11:51.000
I think it's
pretty clear that Jep

11:51.001 --> 11:53.795
is bitter over losing
the skeet shoot.

11:53.796 --> 11:55.505
I named after Ronda Rousey.

11:55.506 --> 11:56.714
Ronda Rally?

11:56.715 --> 11:58.091
Ronda Rousey.

11:58.092 --> 12:00.594
The last fight, she got ko'd.

12:01.846 --> 12:04.013
That's a good point.

12:04.014 --> 12:06.182
I'm not concerned at all.

12:06.183 --> 12:10.019
It's not the gun, it's the
man pulling the trigger.

12:10.020 --> 12:11.062
Three shots a piece,

12:11.063 --> 12:13.482
whoever hits the most, wins.

12:13.774 --> 12:15.900
He ain't going to hit that.

12:15.901 --> 12:17.486
Ain't no way.

12:21.282 --> 12:23.283
You hit about
five feet in front of it.

12:23.284 --> 12:24.451
Not good for you.

12:24.452 --> 12:25.619
Oh for one.

12:27.246 --> 12:28.956
Ay, let me try this again.

12:31.792 --> 12:33.960
Swing and a miss.

12:33.961 --> 12:35.587
Jep may have a slight advantage

12:35.588 --> 12:36.796
in this instance,

12:36.797 --> 12:39.507
but I'm not one who
scares easily.

12:39.508 --> 12:41.926
I'm going for pride now, Si.

12:41.927 --> 12:43.261
Look close...

12:43.262 --> 12:46.307
do you see any fear
in these eyes?

12:49.643 --> 12:50.685
Wow!

12:50.686 --> 12:52.312
- >> He got that one.
Ooh-yeah!

12:52.313 --> 12:53.688
I didn't think so.

12:53.689 --> 12:55.023
All right, let's see what

12:55.024 --> 12:56.650
ol' Ronda can do.

12:57.193 --> 12:58.693
Jase is about to
find out that not

12:58.694 --> 13:00.361
only is my rifle bigger,

13:00.362 --> 13:01.654
but I know how to use it.

13:01.655 --> 13:03.490
Let me zoom way up!

13:03.491 --> 13:05.283
He just brought a pee shooter,

13:05.284 --> 13:06.326
to a cannon fight.

13:06.327 --> 13:08.828
And I'm about to
make split pea soup

13:08.829 --> 13:10.831
at about three hundred yards.

13:11.665 --> 13:14.335
Wow!
Oh boy.

13:14.835 --> 13:15.835
Here we go.

13:25.262 --> 13:26.638
The winner.

13:26.639 --> 13:29.307
Whose got two
thumbs and just won a rifle?

13:29.308 --> 13:30.934
This guy.

13:30.935 --> 13:32.185
Well Martin, looks like that gun

13:32.186 --> 13:33.228
is mine now.

13:33.229 --> 13:34.270
Well, hey,

13:34.271 --> 13:36.523
I won the shot gun competition,

13:36.524 --> 13:39.526
you won the rifle,
we're still even.

13:39.527 --> 13:41.069
That's a good point.
We are still even.

13:41.070 --> 13:42.612
Hey, I got a buddy over here

13:42.613 --> 13:43.489
that does something
don't neither one

13:43.490 --> 13:45.073
of ya'll know something about.

13:45.074 --> 13:45.991
Cowboy shooting.

13:45.992 --> 13:47.033
Are we shooting each other?

13:47.034 --> 13:48.368
Nah, you're shooting
little metal target.

13:48.369 --> 13:50.328
Now that, actually sounds fair.

13:50.329 --> 13:51.496
Let's be cowboys.

13:51.497 --> 13:52.580
Saddle up, partner!

13:52.581 --> 13:54.123
We gone tote
that gun around for years.

13:54.124 --> 13:56.125
I'm over toting this thing.

13:56.126 --> 13:57.461
It don't even work.

14:05.844 --> 14:07.679
- Ya'll ready?
- Making the long trip.

14:07.680 --> 14:10.014
Uh...
I don't know.

14:10.015 --> 14:11.349
You're going to do great.

14:11.350 --> 14:13.768
Your family will know
that you tried.

14:13.769 --> 14:14.769
Yeah.

14:14.770 --> 14:15.812
And that you respect
their traditions

14:15.813 --> 14:16.938
and that's what's important.

14:16.939 --> 14:17.939
Yeah.

14:17.940 --> 14:18.816
Rebecca's family
is going to fall in

14:18.817 --> 14:20.024
love with you and...

14:20.025 --> 14:21.526
Or you'll screw it all up,

14:21.527 --> 14:22.860
and everybody will be mad.

14:22.861 --> 14:24.445
Willie!

14:24.446 --> 14:25.990
Thanks for
having faith in me, Willie.

14:26.991 --> 14:28.741
You're gonna do great.

14:28.742 --> 14:30.326
I think John Reed
and Rebecca are a little

14:30.327 --> 14:32.328
bit nervous about this
whole engagement

14:32.329 --> 14:33.788
ceremony and meeting the family,

14:33.789 --> 14:35.832
but really they have
nothing to worry about.

14:35.833 --> 14:38.293
It's traditional to
wear a red dress

14:38.294 --> 14:39.711
for the engagement ceremony.

14:39.712 --> 14:41.629
Oh!
That is so pretty.

14:41.630 --> 14:43.506
I got you a red dress.
>> I love that.

14:43.507 --> 14:44.549
Isn't that pretty?

14:44.550 --> 14:46.175
Thank you!
>> You're welcome.

14:46.176 --> 14:47.385
John Reed is a great guy,

14:47.386 --> 14:49.345
and I know her
Taiwanese family is

14:49.346 --> 14:51.347
gonna love him just
as much as we do.

14:51.348 --> 14:53.141
They should.
But you never know.

14:53.142 --> 14:55.351
Your parents didn't
like me so...

14:55.352 --> 14:56.853
Well, they liked you.

14:56.854 --> 14:59.188
They just thought were
a little young.

14:59.189 --> 15:00.316
True.

15:01.275 --> 15:02.151
I love ya'll.

15:02.152 --> 15:03.526
See yeah, I love yah.

15:03.527 --> 15:04.403
Have fun.

15:04.404 --> 15:05.820
See you after the summer.

15:05.821 --> 15:07.488
I'm really proud of
Rebecca for honoring

15:07.489 --> 15:08.990
her family's traditions.

15:08.991 --> 15:11.034
I think her family
in Taiwan is gonna

15:11.035 --> 15:12.327
be so proud of her too.

15:12.328 --> 15:13.995
She's gonna love you.

15:13.996 --> 15:15.121
Even though it can be hard to

15:15.122 --> 15:16.831
see your kids grow
up and get married,

15:16.832 --> 15:18.833
I can't wait to walk her
down the aisle.

15:18.834 --> 15:19.668
Oh wait, how do you say

15:19.669 --> 15:21.253
good bye in Taiwanese?

15:22.671 --> 15:23.631
Let's roll.

15:23.632 --> 15:25.340
Is it bad that I
wanna see John Reed

15:25.341 --> 15:26.507
screw up a couple
of things so I can

15:26.508 --> 15:28.509
watch the video?

15:28.510 --> 15:29.761
Don't forget
to record everything.

15:29.762 --> 15:30.679
Yeah.

15:30.680 --> 15:32.097
Good luck eating that food.

15:33.432 --> 15:35.224
You gonna be even skinnier, son.

15:35.225 --> 15:36.934
Aw, they're so cute.

15:36.935 --> 15:38.978
Can you believe we have
another one getting married?

15:38.979 --> 15:41.522
I'm ready for the wedding...
and grandbabies.

15:41.523 --> 15:42.857
Our house is getting smaller.

15:42.858 --> 15:47.071
We only got four or five left.

15:54.328 --> 15:55.828
No, I got 'em.

15:55.829 --> 15:57.664
I got everybody's nick name now.

15:57.665 --> 15:59.332
You're "Lugbox,"

15:59.333 --> 16:02.627
Godwin's "Possum,"
Martin's "Horsehead,"

16:02.628 --> 16:04.837
and Si is "Saddle Sore."

16:04.838 --> 16:06.339
Saddle Sore?

16:06.340 --> 16:07.840
Well, what's up with Possum?

16:07.841 --> 16:09.467
Possum, cause
you'll eat anything.

16:09.468 --> 16:10.677
And what's your handle?

16:10.678 --> 16:13.347
I'm now known as
the Grave Digger.

16:15.307 --> 16:16.787
You sound like
a monster truck now.

16:17.851 --> 16:18.851
Hey Martin, how's it going?

16:18.852 --> 16:19.852
Slick, what's happening, man?

16:19.853 --> 16:20.895
Man, good to see you.

16:20.896 --> 16:22.063
Everybody... Slick.

16:22.064 --> 16:23.314
Pleasure to meet you.

16:23.315 --> 16:25.316
After two shooting competitions,

16:25.317 --> 16:26.776
we have a tied score.

16:26.777 --> 16:28.820
This is my
daughter, Lily-Bleu.

16:28.821 --> 16:30.196
Lily Bleu!

16:30.197 --> 16:31.447
Pleasure.

16:31.448 --> 16:33.616
She's a current World
National Buckarette Champion.

16:33.617 --> 16:34.493
Wow.

16:34.494 --> 16:36.285
So it all comes down to this,

16:36.286 --> 16:38.329
a cowboy shoot out.

16:38.330 --> 16:39.872
Lily Bleu's going
to show you how to do it.

16:39.873 --> 16:40.998
How old are you, Lily Bleu?

16:40.999 --> 16:41.834
Fourteen.

16:41.835 --> 16:42.917
Fourteen?!

16:42.918 --> 16:44.670
I feel sorry for
your future boyfriend.

16:45.671 --> 16:47.004
Now, I've always wondered how

16:47.005 --> 16:49.924
I would fair in the
old wild west.

16:49.925 --> 16:51.593
Now we're fixed to see.

16:51.969 --> 16:54.638
Shooter ready.

17:04.690 --> 17:05.691
Oh jeez.

17:12.656 --> 17:14.031
Okay, boys.
Get settled.

17:14.032 --> 17:15.658
Get ya'll some of that.

17:15.659 --> 17:18.161
That's how it's done.

17:18.162 --> 17:19.328
It's up to you guys.

17:19.329 --> 17:20.663
All right, you're up, Jase.

17:20.664 --> 17:21.664
I wanna see this.

17:21.665 --> 17:22.665
That's kind of hard to follow.

17:22.666 --> 17:23.500
No pressure.

17:23.500 --> 17:24.334
All right.
Let's do this.

17:24.335 --> 17:25.376
Shooter ready.

17:25.377 --> 17:26.545
Hold on.

17:29.840 --> 17:32.008
I'm one of the few
people that believes

17:32.009 --> 17:35.554
that I would have
flourished in the old west.

17:38.932 --> 17:41.142
You are either quick
and accurate,

17:41.143 --> 17:42.227
or you're dead.

17:44.104 --> 17:45.188
That's why I'm known...

17:45.189 --> 17:46.690
as the Grave Digger.

17:49.234 --> 17:50.318
Done.

17:50.319 --> 17:51.153
Forty five seconds.

17:51.153 --> 17:52.153
Forty five?!

17:53.822 --> 17:55.656
When you hear the shot go off,

17:55.657 --> 17:57.658
get the shovel ready.

17:57.659 --> 17:59.076
That's not bad for an old man.

17:59.077 --> 18:01.162
I'm not build for speed.

18:01.163 --> 18:02.580
What I would do in the west,

18:02.581 --> 18:04.332
is shoot and run.

18:04.333 --> 18:06.126
Re-load.
Shoot, run.

18:07.127 --> 18:08.795
It was a long way to get here,

18:08.796 --> 18:10.505
but finally,
grandpa's rifle is coming

18:10.506 --> 18:12.340
home with it's rightful owner.

18:12.341 --> 18:14.510
Jep, all you gotta do is
beat forty five seconds.

18:15.844 --> 18:17.164
All right,
let's see what you got.

18:21.850 --> 18:24.061
Wow.
So far, he's ahead.

18:27.147 --> 18:28.648
I'm not teenage girl fast,

18:28.649 --> 18:30.609
but I'm way faster than Jase.

18:31.985 --> 18:33.319
Sweet.

18:33.320 --> 18:36.697
He was Mountain Man fast.

18:36.698 --> 18:38.699
You got thirty three, forty two.

18:38.700 --> 18:39.992
Woo.

18:39.993 --> 18:41.285
That was pretty good,
but he missed.

18:41.286 --> 18:42.162
Yep.

18:42.163 --> 18:43.163
That's five seconds
for each miss,

18:43.164 --> 18:44.622
so that's ten seconds
added to your time.

18:44.623 --> 18:45.499
So it makes it-

18:45.500 --> 18:46.500
Forty three-forty two.

18:46.501 --> 18:48.501
So he beats me
by a second and a half?

18:48.502 --> 18:50.002
Dude, this is about speed.

18:50.003 --> 18:51.504
That rifle is mine.

18:51.505 --> 18:53.966
The Grave Digger,
just got buried.

18:55.175 --> 18:56.635
You just got dug.

18:57.511 --> 18:58.470
May he rest in peace.

18:58.471 --> 18:59.679
All my guys are dead.

18:59.680 --> 19:01.806
The two times he missed,
they shot him.

19:01.807 --> 19:03.266
He died.

19:03.267 --> 19:04.184
Your seconds wouldn't
of mattered.

19:04.185 --> 19:05.185
No, cause I shot so fast,

19:05.186 --> 19:06.978
I shot 'em before
they could shoot me.

19:06.979 --> 19:08.521
How do they settle stuff
in the old west?

19:08.522 --> 19:09.897
Duel.
>> Let's do a duel.

19:09.898 --> 19:11.858
The only bad thing
about that is,

19:11.859 --> 19:13.819
one of you is going to be dead.

19:15.612 --> 19:16.654
We using live rounds here?

19:16.655 --> 19:17.864
No, we're gonna
use something else.

19:17.865 --> 19:18.990
Come on, I'll fix you up.

19:18.991 --> 19:20.242
Let's go have a duel.

19:34.256 --> 19:35.507
And draw!

19:39.720 --> 19:41.054
Not in the hat!

19:42.472 --> 19:46.684
My paintball hit
him right above the eyes.

19:46.685 --> 19:47.894
I thought to myself,

19:47.895 --> 19:49.687
"You better be glad
that was a paintball."

19:49.688 --> 19:50.647
Dude, you weren't suppose to

19:50.647 --> 19:51.523
shoot in the head.

19:51.524 --> 19:52.899
They shoot a little high.

19:52.900 --> 19:54.984
He wouldn't a lasted
twenty years

19:54.985 --> 19:56.193
in the wild west.

19:56.194 --> 19:57.820
Probably because
there weren't any

19:57.821 --> 20:00.282
guns around named Ronda.

20:01.366 --> 20:03.868
Well, let me crown
this to the winner.

20:03.869 --> 20:05.828
Now you can go kill
some squirrels and such.

20:05.829 --> 20:06.538
Yes!

20:06.539 --> 20:07.622
You can have it, dude.

20:07.623 --> 20:10.291
My gun's way better,
so I don't really care.

20:10.292 --> 20:11.209
You know what the last thing

20:11.210 --> 20:12.835
that went through your mine was?

20:12.836 --> 20:14.504
- A paintball.
- A paintball.

20:16.798 --> 20:17.840
Father, we're
so thankful for this day.

20:17.841 --> 20:19.008
And thank you for
the many blessings

20:19.009 --> 20:20.009
that you've given us.

20:20.010 --> 20:21.177
We're thankful for this family.

20:21.178 --> 20:22.345
And this time, Father,

20:22.346 --> 20:24.138
we pray for Rebecca
and John Reed,

20:24.139 --> 20:25.514
and just pray that
the you be with

20:25.515 --> 20:26.682
them as they travel.

20:26.683 --> 20:28.017
And Father, thank
you for this food

20:28.018 --> 20:28.977
that you've given us.

20:28.978 --> 20:30.186
Through Jesus we pray, amen.

20:30.187 --> 20:31.520
Amen.

20:31.521 --> 20:32.688
Watching your kids grow up and

20:32.689 --> 20:35.066
move on is
bitter-sweet part of life.

20:35.067 --> 20:37.234
It's tough seeing
the kid that you raised,

20:37.235 --> 20:39.278
go off and start their own life.

20:39.279 --> 20:40.655
But it also makes
you proud to see the

20:40.656 --> 20:42.657
person that they've grown into.

20:42.658 --> 20:44.158
On the other hand,
some people in your

20:44.159 --> 20:45.826
family may never grow up.

20:45.827 --> 20:47.328
And will probably
always have dumb

20:47.329 --> 20:49.330
competitions during work hours.

20:49.331 --> 20:51.958
But the truth is,
there's something comforting

20:51.959 --> 20:53.459
about knowing your
brothers are the

20:53.460 --> 20:55.836
same knucklehead
kids they've always been,

20:55.837 --> 20:57.422
and they always will be.

21:05.013 --> 21:07.181
This is for you.

21:07.182 --> 21:14.189
[Chatter continues]
