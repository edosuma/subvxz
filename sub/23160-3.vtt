00:00.001 --> 00:01.525
I can show you excitement...

00:01.601 --> 00:04.196
like you have never known
in your life.

00:05.439 --> 00:07.498
Run, Waldo!
I am running!

00:07.575 --> 00:09.042
I want to place a call
person to person...

00:09.110 --> 00:10.668
to the President
of the United States.

00:10.745 --> 00:13.111
There's nothing you can do but
lie in bed and contemplate...

00:13.180 --> 00:15.045
the dire consequences
of a hedonistic life.

00:16.216 --> 00:18.742
First you tell me that you're
an insurance investigator...

00:18.819 --> 00:20.719
now you're telling me
you're with the CIA?

00:20.780 --> 00:24.443
Neither Mr. Norris nor myself bear any
resemblance to the dashing James Bond.

00:24.525 --> 00:27.153
<i>Nevertheless, we are both
professionals in the intelligence game.</i>

03:19.700 --> 03:20.894
Hiya, fellas.

03:29.410 --> 03:32.902
<i>In Paradise, each
day is as gentle as the last.</i>

03:33.247 --> 03:35.647
<i>Life flows easily from one
moment into the next...</i>

03:35.716 --> 03:38.276
<i>quietly washing away
limits and boundaries...</i>

03:38.719 --> 03:40.880
<i>until you think
there are no rules at all.</i>

03:41.589 --> 03:42.715
<i>That's a mistake.</i>

03:43.057 --> 03:46.652
<i>There's at least one rule I'd
promised myself I'd never forget.</i>

03:47.094 --> 03:48.925
<i>If you're going to
jump off a cliff...</i>

03:49.363 --> 03:51.126
<i>be sure you're ready to fly.</i>

03:52.266 --> 03:54.530
You said you'd never go
hang-gliding.

03:54.969 --> 03:57.802
Said it was too dangerous.
That's what you said.

03:57.871 --> 03:59.736
Oh, look, a guy can
change his mind, can't he?

03:59.807 --> 04:01.434
I just thought it'd be
good for business.

04:01.508 --> 04:03.305
What's her name?

04:03.711 --> 04:06.475
See, you automatically
assume that it's a woman.

04:06.714 --> 04:08.511
I just thought if I learned
how to hang-glide...

04:08.582 --> 04:10.982
I could, you know,
sneak up on people.

04:11.252 --> 04:13.516
Is she blonde or brunette?

04:13.887 --> 04:14.945
T.C.

04:16.690 --> 04:18.123
Bingo! Brunette.

04:19.159 --> 04:21.149
Hello, Thomas.
Hi, Savannah.

04:22.062 --> 04:23.086
Feeling better?

04:23.163 --> 04:24.152
Well...

04:25.532 --> 04:27.625
Oh, don't answer that!
Thomas Magnum's room.

04:29.036 --> 04:31.004
A Mr. Higgins.

04:32.573 --> 04:35.474
That is the fourth time today
he has called to yell at me.

04:35.542 --> 04:37.635
Hello, Higgins. How
wonderful to hear from you.

04:37.711 --> 04:40.202
I can't stay anyway. I'll
let you talk to your friends.

04:40.281 --> 04:42.044
No, no, this won't take long.
<i>Magnum?</i>

04:42.116 --> 04:45.085
I signed up for a diving
class. I don't want to be late.

04:45.152 --> 04:46.483
Two seconds, I promise.

04:46.553 --> 04:48.544
<i>Magnum, for God's sakes,
are you there?</i>

04:48.622 --> 04:50.522
Yes, Higgins. I'm here.

04:50.591 --> 04:52.024
You promised me
over a month ago...

04:52.092 --> 04:54.151
that you would handle
the security for the exhibit.

04:54.228 --> 04:57.629
Now, with less than three days to
find a replacement, you pull out.

04:57.698 --> 04:59.996
Higgins, you make it sound like
I broke my shoulder on purpose.

05:00.067 --> 05:01.591
<i>I should have
known better than to...</i>

05:02.202 --> 05:04.670
count on you to keep your word.

05:04.772 --> 05:06.637
<i>What?
What? What did you say?</i>

05:07.574 --> 05:10.771
I realize that culture and history
have little meaning to you, Magnum...

05:10.844 --> 05:13.210
but the preservation of the
Aloha Historical Society...

05:13.280 --> 05:15.180
is of the utmost importance
to Robin Masters.

05:15.249 --> 05:17.479
Higgins, I told you
I'd get somebody to cover it.

05:17.551 --> 05:19.075
What are you doing?

05:19.153 --> 05:20.882
People from all over the...
Damn!

05:22.656 --> 05:25.648
People from all over the world
are coming to view this exhibit.

05:26.060 --> 05:27.459
You're eating, aren't you?

05:27.528 --> 05:29.257
You know how I hate
hospital food...

05:29.330 --> 05:31.389
and you're doing this
to drive me crazy.

05:31.465 --> 05:33.023
I am doing nothing of the kind.

05:33.200 --> 05:34.997
What is it? Cream puffs?

05:35.336 --> 05:37.133
The kind with the chocolate
filling? <i>Cream puffs?</i>

05:37.204 --> 05:39.035
I really have to go.

05:39.106 --> 05:41.074
No, I wanna talk to you
about something.

05:41.208 --> 05:44.473
There is nothing for you to tell me
except the name of your replacement.

05:44.578 --> 05:46.637
Bye, Thomas.
No!

05:46.780 --> 05:48.805
Then there's nothing further
for us to discuss.

05:48.882 --> 05:49.871
<i>No, wait-</i>

05:49.950 --> 05:51.178
Higgins?
All right!

05:51.251 --> 05:52.240
Higgins?

05:52.319 --> 05:53.343
Beginner's luck.

05:57.891 --> 06:00.325
The next time I get a crazy
idea to take lessons...

06:00.394 --> 06:02.521
will one of you two guys
please stop me?

06:02.796 --> 06:05.128
We tried, Thomas, but you said
you knew what you were doing.

06:05.199 --> 06:07.064
And you believed me?

06:07.134 --> 06:08.123
Don't answer that!

06:09.770 --> 06:12.295
You can't avoid
your responsibilities, Thomas.

06:12.606 --> 06:14.699
Look, all I need is for
one of you two guys...

06:14.775 --> 06:16.299
to baby-sit the photographs
for me.

06:16.377 --> 06:17.810
You can even take turns.

06:17.878 --> 06:20.608
Man, I ain't cut out for
this security business.

06:21.048 --> 06:22.072
Rick?

06:22.149 --> 06:23.207
Not me, buddy.

06:23.617 --> 06:25.175
Don't answer that!

06:28.422 --> 06:30.583
Magnum's Body Shop.
Tell him I'm not here.

06:30.758 --> 06:31.782
Who?

06:31.859 --> 06:33.326
Tell him I'm in surgery.

06:33.394 --> 06:35.294
Yeah, he's here.
T.C.!

06:35.996 --> 06:37.793
It's for you. It's the Club.

06:40.200 --> 06:41.224
Hello?

06:43.737 --> 06:45.967
Man, you seem
quite a bit out of sorts.

06:46.540 --> 06:47.768
No, really?

06:48.909 --> 06:50.342
Waldo Norris?

06:50.744 --> 06:51.938
Who's Waldo Norris?

06:52.546 --> 06:54.980
It's got to be 15 years
since I've seen him last.

06:56.450 --> 06:58.441
Where's he
at? I'll go pick him up.

06:59.386 --> 07:00.546
He's where?

07:01.188 --> 07:03.520
The last time that I saw you,
I was bailing you out of jail...

07:03.590 --> 07:05.558
and you promised me that
it wouldn't happen again.

07:05.626 --> 07:08.117
I'm sorry, Orville. I just
didn't know who else to call.

07:08.195 --> 07:09.992
How can you throw
your life away like this?

07:10.063 --> 07:11.462
You got everything
going for you.

07:11.532 --> 07:13.056
You're smart.
You're funny.

07:13.200 --> 07:14.189
I'm short.

07:14.668 --> 07:16.761
You could be anything
you wanna be.

07:16.837 --> 07:18.327
And here you are,
a common thief.

07:18.405 --> 07:21.374
Oh, that hurts, Orville.
How can you say that about me?

07:21.708 --> 07:23.972
Just look at the police
report. Breaking and entering?

07:24.044 --> 07:25.875
Oh, sure,
take the police's side of it.

07:25.946 --> 07:27.311
Don't even listen to my side.

07:27.381 --> 07:29.281
If they tell you that
I'm breaking and entering...

07:29.349 --> 07:31.283
go ahead, just assume
I'm breaking and entering.

07:31.852 --> 07:34.548
Waldo, what were you doing?

07:37.191 --> 07:38.590
Breaking and entering.

07:40.661 --> 07:43.391
But Orville,
it's not what it looks like.

07:43.764 --> 07:45.925
Will you just listen to me
for one second?

07:50.571 --> 07:52.766
Waldo, you're putting me on.

07:52.940 --> 07:55.238
Insurance investigator?

07:55.742 --> 07:58.905
Yeah, well, it's not a
glamorous job, but it pays well.

07:59.646 --> 08:01.739
Since when does
an insurance investigator...

08:01.815 --> 08:04.682
dress up like a cat burglar
and break into people's homes?

08:04.751 --> 08:07.811
Well, it's not exactly a home.
It's more like a museum.

08:08.589 --> 08:10.420
It belongs to these people
named Vanderville.

08:10.491 --> 08:12.152
They're trying to
convert it into a...

08:12.326 --> 08:14.590
What do you call it?
Historical site.

08:15.062 --> 08:18.088
They came over about a month
ago with a bunch of antiques.

08:18.165 --> 08:20.258
Said they were gonna
display them to the public.

08:20.334 --> 08:22.325
Only one of them
turned up missing.

08:22.836 --> 08:25.100
You ever heard of a
place called Meissen? No.

08:25.606 --> 08:27.335
Well, it's a place in Germany
where they've made...

08:27.407 --> 08:31.104
antique china figurines
since about 1700.

08:31.778 --> 08:34.576
Well, these Vandervilles
had one dated 1810.

08:34.914 --> 08:36.644
Said it got lost in the move.

08:36.717 --> 08:39.811
Henderson-Aames doesn't think
so. That's where I come in.

08:39.886 --> 08:42.447
Well, who's Henderson-Aames?
Not who. What?

08:42.523 --> 08:44.684
Henderson-Aames is
an insurance company.

08:44.758 --> 08:46.817
They want me to prove
the figurine is in the house.

08:46.894 --> 08:47.952
So you broke in?

08:48.028 --> 08:50.394
I thought I could get in,
get a photograph and get out.

08:50.464 --> 08:53.558
No one would be the wiser.
It sounded good.

08:53.700 --> 08:55.133
Didn't work out that way.

08:55.202 --> 08:57.227
Hey, I'm just sorry to have
involved you, Orville.

08:57.304 --> 08:59.169
Hey, what're old friends for?

08:59.373 --> 09:01.739
You got any other good ideas
that maybe I should know about?

09:01.808 --> 09:04.902
No, no, I'm gonna get that
figurine by shuffling paperwork.

09:04.978 --> 09:06.946
It might take me a lot longer...

09:07.014 --> 09:10.108
but from now on this case is
nothing but routine and paperwork...

09:10.317 --> 09:11.841
paperwork and routine.

09:14.888 --> 09:16.048
Look out!

09:18.692 --> 09:20.626
Run, Waldo!
I am running!

09:31.405 --> 09:33.270
Cross at the corner, you jerks!

09:49.522 --> 09:50.887
<i>Rick once told me that...</i>

09:50.957 --> 09:53.482
<i>the little people were
God's chosen people.</i>

09:53.926 --> 09:56.394
<i>Like leprechauns,
lucky to have around.</i>

09:57.296 --> 09:59.787
<i>I guess that depends
on your definition of luck.</i>

10:00.199 --> 10:03.168
I told you, Waldo, we should
have gone to the police yesterday.

10:03.503 --> 10:05.095
What can the police do?

10:05.171 --> 10:07.435
They can take a description.
Show you pictures.

10:07.507 --> 10:09.338
You think they're gonna
listen to me?

10:09.408 --> 10:11.069
They think I'm a...

10:11.177 --> 10:12.906
What did you call it?
Common thief.

10:12.979 --> 10:16.073
Oh, Waldo. No, we're not
gonna go to the police.

10:16.148 --> 10:20.084
Some guy's shooting at me,
and I wanna know who it is.

10:20.152 --> 10:22.245
I know who it is.

10:23.155 --> 10:24.144
You do?

10:24.257 --> 10:27.522
Some guy the Vandervilles sent
to scare me off the case.

10:27.894 --> 10:31.193
Only we don't intimidate
that easily, do we, Orville?

10:33.533 --> 10:35.023
"We?"

10:35.134 --> 10:36.499
What do you mean, "we"?

10:36.736 --> 10:40.172
Well, I was just thinking,
maybe you could help me.

10:40.973 --> 10:41.997
No!

10:43.009 --> 10:44.567
N- O, no!

10:44.710 --> 10:46.302
You don't have to go in with me.

10:46.379 --> 10:48.404
I just need to get back inside.

10:48.848 --> 10:51.817
You said paperwork
and routine. No breaking in.

10:51.884 --> 10:54.216
That was before someone
started shooting at me.

10:54.287 --> 10:56.346
You can see how
that would change things.

10:57.957 --> 11:00.585
Well, why don't you call
Henderson and... Aames.

11:00.660 --> 11:03.094
And Aames, and tell them
you're off the case.

11:05.932 --> 11:07.024
You're right.

11:07.633 --> 11:09.863
I've imposed on you
too much already.

11:11.203 --> 11:14.434
You bailed me outta jail and
you put me up at your place.

11:16.008 --> 11:18.203
What? No, what?

11:19.145 --> 11:22.706
Oh, it's just that staying here
with you reminds me of Taylor Street.

11:22.915 --> 11:24.712
Do you remember Taylor Street?

11:25.685 --> 11:27.812
Yeah, I remember Taylor Street.

11:28.454 --> 11:32.550
There was this kid. He couldn't
have been more than 16 years old.

11:32.625 --> 11:35.924
Kind of looked like you,
Orville, only more innocent-like.

11:36.562 --> 11:39.827
Well, one day he comes to me
and he says he's in trouble.

11:40.333 --> 11:43.598
He says that some guy
is out to break his fingers.

11:43.869 --> 11:46.736
Says he wouldn't come to me,
except I'm his best friend.

11:47.206 --> 11:50.141
Anyway, he wants me to go out,
risk my own neck...

11:50.209 --> 11:54.202
to get my hands on some cash before
the guy with the bad temper finds him.

11:54.981 --> 11:58.542
'Course, back in those days, you
did what you could to help a pal.

11:59.986 --> 12:01.715
So, anyway, I go out
and I get the money.

12:01.787 --> 12:04.051
A nickel here, a dime there.

12:04.123 --> 12:05.522
Funny thing.

12:06.058 --> 12:08.959
That kid today, he's a big shot.

12:09.562 --> 12:11.462
Runs a fancy club.

12:12.932 --> 12:14.627
Who would've thought it?

12:17.036 --> 12:19.504
Okay, Waldo.
What do you want me to do?

12:21.107 --> 12:24.076
I know where I made a mistake
with the alarm system.

12:24.276 --> 12:26.005
I think I can get in...

12:26.312 --> 12:28.473
and get out. But I don't know
how much time I have.

12:28.547 --> 12:31.311
I want to be prepared.
If you get caught...

12:31.384 --> 12:33.648
I won't get caught,
if I know where I'm going.

12:33.719 --> 12:35.209
I need a floor plan.

12:38.391 --> 12:40.018
The grounds are
even more impressive...

12:40.092 --> 12:41.457
than I had imagined.

12:41.527 --> 12:43.358
They're certainly adequate
for our little exhibit.

12:44.530 --> 12:46.691
You're far too modest,
Mr. Higgins.

12:46.799 --> 12:49.768
This collection of artists'
drawings and architect renderings...

12:49.835 --> 12:52.895
should hardly be referred to
as a little exhibit.

12:53.039 --> 12:55.735
Still, to have attracted the
attention of the Smithsonian...

12:55.808 --> 12:57.833
that's an honor
I had not anticipated.

12:57.910 --> 13:00.105
Well, where do I begin?

13:00.346 --> 13:03.747
Well, I've catalogued the
sketches by island and year.

13:04.316 --> 13:06.807
I would be most happy to
go through them with you.

13:07.119 --> 13:09.986
No need for me to take up
any more of your time.

13:10.122 --> 13:11.350
I don't mind.

13:12.925 --> 13:16.452
No, I'm sure the sketches will
speak eloquently for themselves.

13:17.296 --> 13:20.026
Yes. Yes,
you're quite right.

13:21.367 --> 13:24.734
Oh, and on the day of the
exhibit, if you'd be so kind...

13:24.804 --> 13:26.772
to pose with one
or two of the sketches...

13:26.839 --> 13:30.832
I'm sure our readers will want to get
a look at the man behind the event.

13:31.077 --> 13:33.341
Certainly. Anything I can do
to be of help.

13:37.750 --> 13:41.186
Well, I'll let you get on
with your work.

13:41.887 --> 13:45.118
Oh, and when I'm through, if
you would join me for a brandy.

13:45.458 --> 13:48.291
It's not every day I run across
someone who shares my love...

13:48.360 --> 13:50.920
for Hawaiian history
and architecture.

13:51.097 --> 13:52.724
It would be my great pleasure.

14:24.630 --> 14:25.995
Hiya, fellas.

14:29.568 --> 14:31.763
I really wish
you'd reconsider Thomas.

14:32.037 --> 14:33.527
I can show you excitement...

14:33.606 --> 14:35.972
like you have never known
in your life.

14:36.041 --> 14:38.032
Savannah-
You can watch me until...

14:38.110 --> 14:41.409
you are completely confident.
And then we'll do it together.

14:41.647 --> 14:44.013
We are not going
to do it at all.

14:44.283 --> 14:46.217
I like to do it face to face.

14:46.752 --> 14:50.483
It is so wonderful to watch
your partner's expression...

14:50.556 --> 14:53.889
with heart pounding,
ears ringing...

14:54.326 --> 14:57.659
falling together through space
until that moment...

14:57.963 --> 15:00.864
when your body is
jerked upward and shudders-

15:00.933 --> 15:03.959
Savannah! As the chute
catches and you float...

15:04.036 --> 15:05.697
gently to the ground.

15:06.839 --> 15:10.331
I am not going up in an
airplane so you can push me out.

15:10.609 --> 15:12.839
It's perfectly safe.
Safe?

15:13.078 --> 15:14.807
Are you kidding?

15:15.514 --> 15:17.345
You're nervous.
No.

15:17.616 --> 15:19.743
No, you don't understand.
Of course, I understand.

15:19.819 --> 15:21.286
Everyone's nervous
the first time.

15:21.353 --> 15:22.911
No, you don't understand.

15:22.988 --> 15:25.013
This is not my first time.

15:25.090 --> 15:27.149
I did my share of jumping
out of planes in the Navy.

15:27.226 --> 15:29.592
It did not give me a thrill.
I don't like it.

15:29.862 --> 15:32.660
I'll go with you.
You stay out of this.

15:35.034 --> 15:36.194
Well...

15:36.535 --> 15:38.662
if you change your mind,
let me know.

15:38.737 --> 15:40.432
You don't have to go yet.

15:40.906 --> 15:42.271
Visiting hours are over.

15:42.341 --> 15:43.774
Savannah?

15:45.544 --> 15:48.240
Maybe, we could figure out...

15:48.380 --> 15:50.644
something else
that we could do together.

15:52.985 --> 15:54.452
Bye, Thomas.

15:56.388 --> 15:57.480
Bye.

16:02.061 --> 16:03.323
How about a game?

16:03.829 --> 16:05.023
Sure. Why not?

16:05.097 --> 16:06.325
You mean it?

16:11.837 --> 16:14.897
The Vandervilles
owned it since 1947.

16:14.974 --> 16:16.464
It was sold six months ago.

16:16.575 --> 16:18.440
Who bought it
from the Vandervilles?

16:19.345 --> 16:22.178
Torpo Corporation.
William Shuler, President.

16:22.748 --> 16:23.737
Thanks.

16:25.451 --> 16:28.978
Miss, who owned it before 1947?

16:31.390 --> 16:33.051
Garth Braden.

16:33.792 --> 16:35.726
Thanks again.
You're welcome.

16:42.134 --> 16:45.103
<i>One thing I've learned
being a private investigator...</i>

16:45.170 --> 16:47.764
<i>never believe anything
anyone tells you.</i>

16:48.307 --> 16:50.104
<i>Unless you think it's true.</i>

16:50.342 --> 16:52.867
<i>Waldo's story sounded
a little far-fetched to me...</i>

16:52.945 --> 16:54.606
<i>but then, I'm not Rick.</i>

16:54.947 --> 16:57.438
<i>And Rick was sure that as
soon as he checked it out...</i>

16:57.549 --> 17:00.040
<i>he'd see that Waldo
was telling him the truth.</i>

17:05.491 --> 17:08.688
<i>Of course,
Rick can be wrong, too.</i>

17:17.536 --> 17:20.060
I find it hard to believe
that any friend of yours...

17:20.138 --> 17:21.902
is a photographer
for the Smithsonian.

17:22.007 --> 17:23.598
He told you he was
with the Smithsonian?

17:23.675 --> 17:25.576
He showed me his identification.

17:25.644 --> 17:27.669
I can't believe
he's doing it again.

17:29.415 --> 17:30.780
Mr. Norris?

17:32.151 --> 17:33.140
How odd!

17:34.119 --> 17:36.110
I wonder where
he could have gotten to?

17:36.188 --> 17:38.019
Looks like he went out
through the double doors.

17:38.090 --> 17:41.457
Don't be ridiculous. He'd
never have gotten past the lads.

17:43.796 --> 17:45.661
Oh, my God!

17:50.769 --> 17:54.170
It's gone. The 1923 sketch of
the Braden Estate is missing.

17:54.373 --> 17:56.000
Braden? Garth Braden?

17:57.376 --> 17:59.276
What are you doing?
Telephoning the police.

17:59.345 --> 18:01.176
Valuable property has been
stolen from the estate...

18:01.246 --> 18:02.770
and I intend to
report it immediately.

18:02.848 --> 18:04.247
Wait, Higgins,
he's a friend of mine.

18:04.316 --> 18:06.341
I'll find the sketch.
I'll get it back for you.

18:06.418 --> 18:09.046
Do you have any idea how much
that drawing is worth?

18:09.121 --> 18:12.147
I'm sure there's a very good
reason Waldo borrowed it.

18:12.558 --> 18:13.752
"Borrowed it?"

18:13.859 --> 18:17.351
Bribed the lads and crept away
like a thief in the night.

18:17.429 --> 18:19.226
Just don't call the police.

18:25.938 --> 18:28.463
Oh, hi, Orville.
Don't "Hi, Orville" me, Waldo.

18:28.540 --> 18:30.201
I need some answers
to some questions.

18:30.275 --> 18:31.606
Well, I'm on my way out.

18:31.677 --> 18:33.144
Where's the sketch?
What sketch?

18:33.212 --> 18:35.612
The Braden sketch. What did
you do with Higgins' picture?

18:35.681 --> 18:39.173
Oh, I had to borrow it. I hope I didn't
inconvenience that nice Mr. Higgins any.

18:39.251 --> 18:41.981
Inconvenience? Is that how you
describe lying and stealing?

18:42.054 --> 18:43.681
Look, I'm sorry.
I just gotta get going.

18:43.756 --> 18:46.020
You're not going anywhere until
you tell me what's going on.

18:46.091 --> 18:47.080
Orville!

18:47.159 --> 18:48.683
Henderson...
Aames.

18:48.761 --> 18:50.888
Henderson-Aames Insurance
Company. They never heard of you.

18:50.963 --> 18:52.191
No?
No.

18:52.264 --> 18:53.253
I can explain.

18:53.332 --> 18:54.924
Oh, good. And while
you're explaining that...

18:55.034 --> 18:56.661
maybe you can explain
how the Vandervilles...

18:56.735 --> 18:59.533
could have possibly filed an
insurance claim a month ago.

18:59.705 --> 19:03.004
They sold that place and moved
to Vermont last spring, Waldo.

19:03.342 --> 19:05.708
Now, come on. I'm listening,
you explain that.

19:10.816 --> 19:12.613
I didn't wanna
have to tell you this.

19:12.684 --> 19:15.346
The company prefers that
we keep a cover at all times.

19:15.421 --> 19:18.015
Even with our families
and our close friends.

19:18.924 --> 19:20.357
What company?

19:21.126 --> 19:22.684
I'm with the CIA.

19:23.662 --> 19:24.993
Come on, Waldo.

19:25.064 --> 19:27.828
First you tell me that you're
an insurance investigator.

19:27.900 --> 19:30.300
Then you tell Higgins that
you're with the Smithsonian.

19:30.369 --> 19:32.166
Now you're telling me
you're with the CIA?

19:32.237 --> 19:33.966
I know it's a little hard
to believe.

19:34.173 --> 19:35.834
A little hard!

19:39.645 --> 19:41.636
Don't they have
a height requirement?

19:42.014 --> 19:44.244
Actually, my height works
to my advantage.

19:44.316 --> 19:47.285
I can get into places that
ordinary men can't fit into.

19:47.453 --> 19:49.785
And thanks to this sketch
I got from Mr. Higgins...

19:49.855 --> 19:51.618
I'll be able
to get inside that house...

19:51.690 --> 19:54.158
and find the figurine
before Stewart does.

19:54.226 --> 19:56.217
Who's Stew... Stewart.

19:56.295 --> 19:57.853
The guy that was shooting at us.

19:59.231 --> 20:01.665
A Meissen figurine was
smuggled out of Germany...

20:01.733 --> 20:04.099
in the final days
of World War II.

20:04.169 --> 20:06.797
Inside is a document that names
the location and numbers...

20:06.872 --> 20:08.897
of several Swiss bank accounts.

20:08.974 --> 20:11.374
If Stewart gets his hands
on that figurine...

20:11.443 --> 20:13.911
that money will be funneled to
a bunch of Nazi war criminals...

20:13.979 --> 20:15.241
in South America.

20:15.314 --> 20:18.579
Naturally, we'd like to find
those accounts before he does.

20:21.954 --> 20:23.854
Where you going?
Going to get my jacket.

20:23.922 --> 20:26.482
I don't know whether to believe
you or not, but I'm going with you.

20:26.558 --> 20:29.789
No! I can't put you
in any danger.

20:30.162 --> 20:31.686
I've got to do this on my own.

20:31.763 --> 20:33.390
I can't let you go out
by yourself...

20:33.465 --> 20:36.593
with a giant like Stewart
just waiting to blow you away.

20:53.224 --> 20:56.250
<i>My dad once told me that
life is a trick done with mirrors.</i>

20:56.320 --> 20:59.448
<i>You look at something from one
direction, it looks like one thing.</i>

20:59.523 --> 21:02.321
<i>You turn it over,
it looks like something else.</i>

21:02.626 --> 21:03.923
<i>I guess he was right.</i>

21:03.994 --> 21:06.758
<i>Sometimes it's hard to tell
who's a real friend...</i>

21:06.831 --> 21:09.026
<i>and who's just
an illusion in glass.</i>

21:11.602 --> 21:13.797
I told you the
police would buy that story.

21:13.871 --> 21:14.997
What are you doing?

21:15.072 --> 21:17.131
I mean, Stewart just
looks like the kind of guy...

21:17.208 --> 21:19.233
you'd find dead
in a parking lot.

21:19.310 --> 21:21.335
Could've been
a drug deal, anything.

21:21.412 --> 21:22.538
What are you doing?

21:22.613 --> 21:25.411
Orville, whoever killed
Stewart is after that figurine.

21:25.483 --> 21:27.314
I've got to get to it tonight.

21:27.384 --> 21:30.182
You're not going anywhere until
I find out who you're working for.

21:30.254 --> 21:32.222
I told you who I'm working for.

21:32.289 --> 21:33.984
And the Agency
will be very pleased...

21:34.058 --> 21:37.221
that you kept my name out of all
this nasty business with Stewart.

21:40.464 --> 21:42.489
I didn't kill him, Orville.

21:42.566 --> 21:44.466
I gotta find that out
for myself.

21:44.535 --> 21:46.628
And until I do,
you're under house arrest.

21:46.704 --> 21:49.935
Why don't you call the CIA?
They've got my personnel file.

21:51.175 --> 21:53.370
It's 3:00 a. M.
In Washington, DC.

21:53.444 --> 21:55.207
I suspect, just suspect...

21:55.279 --> 21:57.474
that there's nobody in
at the moment.

21:57.548 --> 21:59.345
You're not gonna
lock me up here, are you?

21:59.416 --> 22:01.611
What, are you nuts? I'm sure
you could break out of here...

22:01.685 --> 22:03.243
by the time
I got my car in reverse.

22:03.320 --> 22:04.878
No, Waldo,
I'm going to stash you...

22:04.955 --> 22:07.253
somewhere I know you're
gonna be real, real safe.

22:07.324 --> 22:09.349
I ain't baby-sitting
no pint-sized fugitive.

22:09.426 --> 22:10.415
Come on, T.C.

22:10.494 --> 22:13.258
All I'm asking you to do is to make
sure nobody goes in or out of here...

22:13.330 --> 22:14.319
for a couple of hours.

22:14.398 --> 22:16.798
You got Higgins pulling
guard duty. You don't need me.

22:16.867 --> 22:18.425
He slipped past Higgins
once before.

22:18.502 --> 22:21.164
I can't take the chance
of him slipping by him again.

22:22.339 --> 22:24.830
Look if the police implicate
Waldo in this murder...

22:24.909 --> 22:26.240
they're gonna hold me
as an accessory.

22:26.310 --> 22:29.245
If he pulls a vanishing act,
that leaves me holding the bag.

22:29.513 --> 22:33.313
Oh, so good old Theodore Calvin
gets to pull backup brigade.

22:33.751 --> 22:35.616
Who else can I call, T.C.?

22:38.923 --> 22:40.652
Two hours.
Thanks.

22:41.158 --> 22:43.456
I'll be back.
I promise.

22:45.496 --> 22:47.259
Wonder what he promised Higgins?

22:47.698 --> 22:49.529
Complete security duty
for the exhibit.

22:49.600 --> 22:52.660
Orville promised you all that
just to keep an eye on me?

22:52.736 --> 22:54.897
Not that it's any concern
of yours.

22:54.972 --> 22:56.803
A fella likes to know
what he's worth.

22:56.874 --> 22:58.034
As far as I'm concerned...

22:58.108 --> 23:00.372
impersonating a representative
of the Smithsonian...

23:00.444 --> 23:02.708
is reason enough
to have you incarcerated.

23:02.780 --> 23:05.442
However, your friend Rick seems
determined to see that you are not...

23:05.516 --> 23:09.680
falsely accused of a crime, and since
the Braden sketch has been returned...

23:11.855 --> 23:15.313
The Winslow drawing.
What have you done with it?

23:15.960 --> 23:18.428
Sorry. I like to
keep in shape.

23:24.969 --> 23:27.665
Torpo Corporation?
Never heard of it.

23:27.738 --> 23:29.603
Does the name William Shuler
ring a bell?

23:29.673 --> 23:32.073
He's the guy
that bought that place.

23:32.543 --> 23:36.673
Rick, don't you think you're going to
an awful lot of trouble for old Waldo?

23:36.747 --> 23:39.910
Especially since he has this
nasty habit of lying to you.

23:39.984 --> 23:42.976
Maybe he isn't lying. Maybe he
really does work for the CIA.

23:43.053 --> 23:45.146
Do you know
how unlikely that is?

23:45.356 --> 23:47.221
Unlikely, but not impossible.

23:47.324 --> 23:49.918
He gave me this code word and he
told me that he can gain access...

23:49.994 --> 23:52.428
into the company's computer
anytime, day or night.

23:52.496 --> 23:55.795
If the code word works, we can go
in and get the personnel file out...

23:55.866 --> 23:57.356
we'll know
if he's telling the truth.

23:57.434 --> 24:00.665
If the code word doesn't work,
well, we'll know he's lying, again.

24:00.738 --> 24:02.763
Again.
Again.

24:02.840 --> 24:05.035
Rick, how can you be so naive?

24:05.109 --> 24:07.202
He gives you
some exotic code word.

24:07.277 --> 24:09.973
Look, he knows you can't
get into their computer.

24:10.047 --> 24:12.982
But that's where he's wrong.
We can go through the NIA.

24:13.050 --> 24:14.415
And you can call
Lieutenant Poole.

24:14.485 --> 24:16.214
She's in Washington.

24:16.387 --> 24:18.184
She is?
Yes.

24:18.889 --> 24:22.086
Well, call somebody. Somebody should
be able to get into that computer.

24:22.159 --> 24:24.127
I can.
What?

24:24.194 --> 24:26.822
You can? Sure. My dad's
company has a computer.

24:26.897 --> 24:28.091
I call it up all the time.

24:28.165 --> 24:31.134
You just plug this into here,
like this, and call them up.

24:31.201 --> 24:35.297
You'll get the information on the television.
All you need is the code word.

24:39.877 --> 24:43.677
O- R-R-I-S...

24:44.114 --> 24:46.912
W- A-L-D-O. It's
working. Here it comes.

24:49.153 --> 24:51.883
Boston, Massachusetts,
December 1941.

24:51.955 --> 24:53.786
"Yale." Yale?

24:54.692 --> 24:57.252
"Married 1964,
Patricia Meyer Norris."

24:57.327 --> 25:00.125
"One child, boy, Spencer,
born 1965."

25:00.464 --> 25:03.262
"Basketball scholarship,
DePaul, 1983."

25:03.333 --> 25:04.698
Basketball?

25:04.935 --> 25:06.061
This is it.

25:07.037 --> 25:09.062
"Operative for the
Central Intelligence Agency..."

25:09.139 --> 25:10.800
"since February, 1959."

25:10.974 --> 25:14.933
I can't believe it. Way back then,
he was always working for the CIA.

25:15.713 --> 25:20.343
"Longshoreman,
newspaper vendor, tour guide, actor."

25:20.451 --> 25:24.717
Well, "actor" is perhaps an
exaggeration. I only made one picture.

25:24.788 --> 25:26.915
I was a stand-in
for a chimpanzee.

25:27.124 --> 25:30.457
I can't believe that all these years
you weren't really Waldo Norris.

25:30.527 --> 25:34.122
Orville,
I was always Waldo Norris.

25:34.431 --> 25:37.594
Yeah, but I thought you were
Waldo Norris, conman, petty thief.

25:37.668 --> 25:41.160
But instead, you were Waldo
Norris, agent for the CIA.

25:41.939 --> 25:44.066
All in the eye of the beholder.

25:45.909 --> 25:47.103
I owe you an apology.

25:47.177 --> 25:49.304
I'm sorry, Waldo. I didn't
believe you and I should have.

25:49.379 --> 25:50.778
No harm done.

25:51.248 --> 25:53.148
If you're working for the CIA...

25:53.217 --> 25:55.742
where were they when you got
busted going over the wall?

25:55.819 --> 25:57.150
I beg your pardon?

25:57.221 --> 25:59.746
I mean, how come
they didn't bail you out?

25:59.823 --> 26:02.656
How come you had to call
your old friend Orville, huh?

26:03.260 --> 26:06.093
The CIA has no jurisdiction
on domestic territory.

26:06.163 --> 26:07.755
That's absolutely true.

26:07.831 --> 26:11.323
If I'm caught doing anything,
shall we say paralegal...

26:11.602 --> 26:14.730
my superiors simply disavow
any knowledge of me.

26:15.139 --> 26:16.401
In fact...

26:16.473 --> 26:20.068
they'd probably bring up that old
chestnut about a height requirement.

26:20.377 --> 26:22.641
Well, it's all well and good
to stand around chatting...

26:22.713 --> 26:25.546
but the man has a mission to
accomplish and time is of the essence.

26:25.616 --> 26:26.913
He's right.

26:27.151 --> 26:31.554
If I may be so bold, I do have
some expertise in these matters.

26:31.822 --> 26:35.553
Perhaps, I can help you find a
way to penetrate the fortress.

27:41.658 --> 27:43.319
"Torpo Corporation."

27:54.771 --> 27:55.931
"Torbo."

27:57.040 --> 28:00.532
How are you supposed to do
this with your arm in a sling?

28:02.479 --> 28:04.106
Torpo.

28:11.054 --> 28:12.749
"Shuler, William."

28:24.134 --> 28:25.601
Shuler Billy?

28:36.413 --> 28:37.641
H, not K.

28:43.487 --> 28:44.954
"Billy Skuler."

28:46.423 --> 28:49.950
"Operative, CIA. January,
1955, through April, 1980."

28:51.028 --> 28:54.555
"Terminated dishonorably
with partners Bubba Stewart..."

28:56.833 --> 28:58.323
"Waldo Norris."

29:00.470 --> 29:01.732
Holy smoleys.

29:03.440 --> 29:05.499
My plan was to
let myself onto the roof...

29:05.575 --> 29:06.872
via this banyan tree...

29:06.944 --> 29:08.741
and let myself in
through the chimney.

29:08.812 --> 29:11.440
But once inside, how do you propose
to get the information back out?

29:12.582 --> 29:15.710
With this floor plan, I should
have no trouble locating the safe.

29:15.786 --> 29:18.448
Once I have that information, I
can break through the light beams...

29:18.522 --> 29:20.285
and get to the wall
before the guards nab me.

29:20.357 --> 29:21.585
Risky.

29:22.793 --> 29:24.260
Robin Masters' estate.

29:24.328 --> 29:26.523
Oh, for heaven's sake, Magnum,
we're busy.

29:26.596 --> 29:29.690
Yes. All right.
He wants to talk to you.

29:32.069 --> 29:33.127
Hi, Thomas.

29:33.203 --> 29:36.502
Have you considered the
standard, double mirror device?

29:36.907 --> 29:39.842
To trick the light beam
into thinking it's continuous.

29:39.910 --> 29:40.899
Yeah.

29:40.978 --> 29:42.673
What an excellent idea.

29:42.946 --> 29:47.144
Double mirror device? You guys are
acting like you're 007 or something.

29:47.217 --> 29:49.208
I realize that neither
Mr. Norris nor myself...

29:49.286 --> 29:51.516
bear any resemblance
to the dashing James Bond.

29:51.588 --> 29:54.489
Nevertheless, we are both
professionals in the intelligence game.

29:54.558 --> 29:56.116
Thanks, Thomas.

29:56.593 --> 29:58.993
I'm afraid
that's not true, Higgins.

29:59.062 --> 30:02.793
Waldo Norris was dishonorably
discharged from the CIA in 1980.

30:03.900 --> 30:06.232
I was hoping you wouldn't
have to find this out.

30:06.303 --> 30:07.634
I thought I'd covered my tracks.

30:07.704 --> 30:09.399
Where did you
get this information?

30:09.473 --> 30:11.998
Cross-referenced
under Billy Skuler.

30:12.409 --> 30:15.435
You get older,
some things slip by you.

30:24.054 --> 30:26.284
I'm afraid I still got
to get into the house.

30:26.356 --> 30:29.325
I can't let you do that.
I'm calling the police.

30:29.493 --> 30:31.256
Put down the phone.

30:32.162 --> 30:33.652
Oh, man.

30:35.599 --> 30:37.032
I'll tell you the truth.

30:37.100 --> 30:38.124
The truth?

30:38.235 --> 30:40.066
Who could believe
anything you say, Waldo?

30:40.137 --> 30:41.866
You use me, you use my friends.

30:41.938 --> 30:44.566
You come up with one outrageous
story after the other.

30:44.641 --> 30:46.802
Who could possibly believe
anything you say?

30:46.877 --> 30:48.310
I thought we were pals.

30:48.378 --> 30:50.175
Yeah, I thought
we were pals, too.

30:50.247 --> 30:51.475
Why didn't you trust me?

30:51.548 --> 30:53.345
I'm trusting you now.

30:56.119 --> 30:58.280
I'm working single-handedly
to overthrow a plot...

30:58.355 --> 31:00.448
against the President
of the United States.

31:02.926 --> 31:04.860
Man, this is where I came in.

31:04.928 --> 31:06.555
Don't try to leave!

31:06.630 --> 31:09.758
This is a matter of national
security. I'll do what I have to do.

31:10.901 --> 31:12.368
He will, T.C.

31:14.271 --> 31:16.262
Six months ago,
I was approached by Skuler...

31:16.339 --> 31:18.364
with a plot
to discredit the President.

31:18.442 --> 31:22.003
A military coup in South America.
The details aren't important.

31:22.145 --> 31:24.670
What is important is
helping out the President.

31:24.748 --> 31:27.444
So I went along with the plot
to get the goods on Skuler.

31:27.517 --> 31:30.486
Does the President know of
Skuler's plot or your actions?

31:30.554 --> 31:34.615
No, nothing. Stewart caught wind
of this and tried to blackmail us.

31:34.825 --> 31:36.725
Skuler had him killed.

31:36.793 --> 31:39.125
And me without any popcorn.

31:39.996 --> 31:43.022
Man, the President
doesn't even know you exist.

31:43.100 --> 31:46.627
T.C.'s right. This is the most
preposterous story you've come up with yet.

31:46.703 --> 31:48.728
Call the President.
What?

31:48.805 --> 31:50.636
Go ahead, call him collect
from Wally Norris.

31:50.707 --> 31:52.140
Ask him if we're not friends.

31:52.209 --> 31:54.734
The charade is over, Waldo.

31:55.045 --> 31:57.240
All right then,
don't believe me.

31:59.616 --> 32:01.641
I'll handle this on my own.

32:04.621 --> 32:05.713
Stay.

32:06.223 --> 32:07.690
Oh, and, Orville...

32:09.526 --> 32:11.756
it was nice seeing you again.

32:15.866 --> 32:17.993
Now I'm calling the police.

32:18.101 --> 32:21.696
I'm reminded of a time during
the North African campaign.

32:21.771 --> 32:24.467
Higgins, this isn't exactly
the time for war stories.

32:24.541 --> 32:25.565
Bear with me.

32:25.642 --> 32:28.941
I believe this story has some relevance
to our current situation here.

32:31.314 --> 32:35.216
A young lad got wind of a regiment
of Jerries on our left flank.

32:35.452 --> 32:38.751
The lad tried to warn us of it,
but he had an unfortunate style.

32:38.822 --> 32:42.849
He had told one whopper too many,
and sadly, no one took him seriously.

32:42.926 --> 32:47.056
The Jerries surprised us, and when it was
all over, I was the only one left alive.

32:47.164 --> 32:50.031
If only we had listened
to the boy who cried wolf.

32:52.135 --> 32:54.535
You mean, you want us
to believe this guy?

32:54.604 --> 32:57.539
What can it cost us to place
the call Waldo asked us to place?

32:57.607 --> 32:59.734
All they can do is refuse it.

32:59.809 --> 33:01.572
What if Waldo
is telling the truth?

33:01.645 --> 33:04.443
He isn't. But what if he is?

33:10.754 --> 33:12.244
All right, Higgins.

33:12.322 --> 33:14.552
But I'm gonna tell you right
now, it's a waste of time.

33:14.624 --> 33:16.922
We have a few moments to spare.

33:21.932 --> 33:23.422
<i>Operator.
</i> Hello, operator.

33:23.500 --> 33:24.967
I want to place a call
to the White House.

33:25.035 --> 33:27.663
Person to person to the
President of the United States.

33:27.971 --> 33:31.930
Yes. From Waldo Norris.
N-O-R-R-I-S.

33:32.309 --> 33:33.970
<i>One moment.</i>
Thank you.

33:36.646 --> 33:38.204
Nothing's happening.

33:38.381 --> 33:40.144
Patience, patience.

33:42.018 --> 33:45.215
This is ridiculous, Higgins.
The President's not going to accept a call from-

33:45.288 --> 33:47.916
<i>Waldo? Is
that you, Wally, old buddy?</i>

33:54.547 --> 33:56.981
Here's to
exciting times together.

34:00.286 --> 34:04.382
How did you ever manage to get dinner
for two catered to your hospital room?

34:04.557 --> 34:08.755
Well, I sort of have this running
tab with the King Kamehameha Club.

34:09.195 --> 34:11.129
Where'd you stash the kid?

34:11.197 --> 34:12.391
Oh, Lee?

34:12.465 --> 34:15.525
Well, they discharged him.
So there was an empty bed.

34:15.868 --> 34:19.031
I mean, wouldn't be anybody
else in here until tomorrow.

34:19.105 --> 34:21.096
I mean...
You know what I mean.

34:22.742 --> 34:25.574
Are you all right?
Yeah. No. Yes, I'm fine.

34:25.643 --> 34:26.906
Here, put it in-
I'm fine.

34:26.978 --> 34:29.675
Put it in cold water. It'll
take the burn away. Ow!

34:36.121 --> 34:38.317
Thomas, I hope-
Savannah, I-

34:38.824 --> 34:40.257
No-
You go first.

34:40.326 --> 34:41.588
No, you go first.

34:43.696 --> 34:46.722
Thomas, I am sorry.
I just can't do it.

34:47.565 --> 34:48.692
I wanted to impress you.

34:48.768 --> 34:51.828
I wanted you to think I was
an exciting, adventurous woman.

34:51.904 --> 34:52.962
I do. I do.

34:53.039 --> 34:55.768
I'm not cut out
for hang-gliding...

34:55.841 --> 34:57.604
and free falling
and scuba diving-

34:57.676 --> 34:58.973
Wait a minute.

35:00.312 --> 35:01.677
What are you saying?

35:03.215 --> 35:07.845
I'm the kind of girl that likes to go
for nice, romantic walks on the beach.

35:11.557 --> 35:14.526
I thought you said you'd
been hang-gliding for years.

35:15.761 --> 35:16.819
I lied.

35:16.896 --> 35:17.954
You lied?

35:18.697 --> 35:19.994
You lied?

35:22.134 --> 35:24.830
What is it? I broke my
shoulder trying to impress you.

35:24.904 --> 35:26.428
You're angry.
Perfectly understandable.

35:26.505 --> 35:27.972
And you want to take walks
along the beach?

35:28.040 --> 35:29.769
I wouldn't blame you if
you never wanted to see me-

35:29.842 --> 35:30.831
No, no, wait a minute.

35:30.910 --> 35:33.003
I wish I could have been that
kind of girl for you, Thomas.

35:33.079 --> 35:34.637
I don't want you to be.

35:34.713 --> 35:35.771
You don't?

35:35.848 --> 35:37.042
No.

35:37.750 --> 35:41.584
I mean, all I wanted
was a nice, quiet...

35:42.288 --> 35:44.688
maybe romantic dinner together.

35:45.825 --> 35:47.156
Do you think we could do that?

35:50.062 --> 35:52.690
We could do that.
I'd love to do that.

35:53.265 --> 35:55.028
I'd love to do that.

35:58.838 --> 36:00.567
Oh!

36:46.552 --> 36:47.985
He's got to be here someplace.

36:48.053 --> 36:51.318
He's had ample time to get inside.
I'm sure we'll find him there.

36:51.390 --> 36:54.791
How are we gonna get in? Leave
that to me. I've gotten us this far.

36:54.960 --> 36:56.291
Off we go.

37:52.218 --> 37:54.118
It looks okay.
Careful.

37:54.186 --> 37:57.678
I'm quite certain this is where
Mr. Norris made his mistake before.

37:57.756 --> 38:00.384
It's wide open.
To the untrained eye.

38:03.529 --> 38:05.121
There it is.

38:06.699 --> 38:11.033
Here, put these mirrors
on the arms exactly as I did.

38:12.137 --> 38:14.901
What is this?
A double mirror device.

38:15.341 --> 38:17.468
We'll bypass the alarm beam.

38:27.253 --> 38:28.743
Ready?
Ready.

38:28.921 --> 38:31.355
All right, let's go.

38:37.696 --> 38:39.561
All right, now very carefully...

38:39.632 --> 38:42.066
place it three inches
from the beam.

38:43.602 --> 38:47.402
Now, position the mirrors
exactly as I do.

38:59.018 --> 39:01.748
Now, lower the arms
exactly as I do.

39:05.791 --> 39:08.487
Higgins, where did you
learn all of this?

39:08.894 --> 39:13.092
Now, very carefully, on the count of
three, move it in front of the beam.

39:13.799 --> 39:17.895
One, two, three.

39:29.481 --> 39:30.641
Now...

39:32.918 --> 39:34.886
step over the beam.

40:54.266 --> 40:56.791
Hey, you. What're you
doing here? Over here!

41:00.406 --> 41:02.772
Higgins!
I'll truss up this chap.

41:02.841 --> 41:05.036
You see if you can
locate Mr. Norris.

41:05.144 --> 41:07.772
Run along, then.
We've no time to lose.

41:17.689 --> 41:19.281
How convenient.

41:22.060 --> 41:23.254
Skuler.

41:24.363 --> 41:26.661
A burglar breaks into my house.

41:27.166 --> 41:29.532
There is an
unfortunate accident.

41:29.601 --> 41:31.535
The second one this week.

41:33.105 --> 41:36.632
Distasteful things happen
to people who double-cross me.

42:34.099 --> 42:35.259
Waldo!

42:46.011 --> 42:49.503
Just take it easy, pal. Don't do
anything you're gonna regret here.

42:53.051 --> 42:54.450
Can't we talk about this?

43:06.632 --> 43:08.691
Higgins, you did it again.

43:10.068 --> 43:11.194
Yes.

43:11.470 --> 43:12.732
Orville?

43:13.205 --> 43:14.297
Waldo.

43:15.440 --> 43:16.873
Are you all right?
Orville.

43:17.743 --> 43:19.870
You came after me.

43:19.945 --> 43:21.207
I suggest that we postpone...

43:21.280 --> 43:24.738
the sentimental reunion until
after we have completed our task.

43:24.816 --> 43:27.979
You're right.
How unprofessional of me.

43:28.053 --> 43:30.681
I just haven't been up to
my standard on this mission.

43:30.756 --> 43:33.020
It can happen to the best of us.

43:33.091 --> 43:34.456
We appear to be on schedule.

43:34.526 --> 43:37.359
If this gentleman and the one in the
hallway don't regain consciousness...

43:37.429 --> 43:40.887
we should be out of here before
anyone knows we've been in. Shall we?

43:45.771 --> 43:48.171
Thanks for
believing in me, Mr. Higgins.

43:49.441 --> 43:52.308
I take pride in never making
the same mistake twice.

43:57.883 --> 44:00.909
All right, we must do it
exactly as we did before.

44:02.087 --> 44:03.987
Adjust that top mirror.

44:13.532 --> 44:16.057
Now, keep your mirror even
with mine as we go down.

44:16.134 --> 44:19.570
Higgins, isn't this taking a little
long? The slightest slip could...

44:19.638 --> 44:22.300
set off the alarm and alert
the entire security force.

44:22.374 --> 44:25.275
It would be unfortunate if
they aroused Mr. Skuler there.

44:25.344 --> 44:29.144
Now, very gently,
on the count of three.

44:29.281 --> 44:32.580
One, two, three.

44:41.026 --> 44:42.357
Let's go.

44:50.135 --> 44:52.603
All right, take them carefully.

44:54.706 --> 44:56.731
We don't need those now.
Let's go!

45:10.288 --> 45:11.755
Right on schedule.

45:18.997 --> 45:20.294
Let's go!

45:45.557 --> 45:48.788
Well done, T.C.
Piece of cake, Higgie-baby.

45:50.929 --> 45:53.022
So that's the figurine
you were telling me about.

45:53.098 --> 45:54.463
The antique from Germany?

45:54.533 --> 45:57.127
This? A cheap imitation.

45:59.971 --> 46:02.940
But these would've bought
a lot of guns.

46:08.447 --> 46:09.675
Did you ever find out...

46:09.748 --> 46:11.375
why your buddy got kicked out
of the CIA?

46:11.450 --> 46:14.783
Yeah, he claims it was all a set up
to keep an eye on Skuler and Stewart.

46:14.886 --> 46:17.047
I suppose that could be true.

46:17.122 --> 46:19.386
My guests are due
to arrive at any moment.

46:19.458 --> 46:22.052
May I ask why you are not
at your appointed post?

46:22.194 --> 46:24.128
I'll be there,
Higgins. I'll be there.

46:24.196 --> 46:26.858
Taking me some time to get this
monkey suit on you ordered me.

46:26.932 --> 46:28.365
Your uniform.

46:30.001 --> 46:31.263
Magnum, I would appreciate it...

46:31.336 --> 46:34.237
if you'd entertain your
own guests in your own room.

46:34.339 --> 46:36.967
My, he's a bit touchy today,
isn't he?

46:37.509 --> 46:39.739
He always gets that way
when he's expecting company.

46:39.811 --> 46:41.403
You can't pay
any attention to him.

46:41.646 --> 46:44.410
Just hope Waldo appreciates
what I'm going through for him.

46:46.118 --> 46:47.710
That's Savannah.

46:47.953 --> 46:49.250
I promised her...

46:49.321 --> 46:52.882
we'd take a nice, safe walk
along the beach today.

46:54.025 --> 46:55.151
Hi.

46:56.394 --> 46:59.761
Who? Oh, yeah, just a minute.
Rick, it's for you. It's the club.

47:06.004 --> 47:08.097
Hello? Yeah.

47:09.074 --> 47:10.200
Really?

47:10.275 --> 47:12.436
Hey, guys,
Wilber Allan Renfro's in town.

47:12.511 --> 47:14.638
Who's Wilber Allan Renfro?

47:14.980 --> 47:17.244
It's got to be like 12 years
since I've seen him.

47:17.315 --> 47:18.680
Oh, no.

47:18.750 --> 47:19.944
Not again.

47:20.385 --> 47:23.218
Hey, where is he?
I'll go and pick him up.

47:24.990 --> 47:27.083
Hey, wait a minute. You can't
just hang up on an old friend.

47:27.159 --> 47:30.253
Orville moved to Australia
and left no forwarding address.

47:30.328 --> 47:32.796
Thomas, I can't dump an
old friend. You just did.

47:32.864 --> 47:35.332
Look, I'm not going to let another
one of your little friends...

47:35.400 --> 47:36.560
get you in any more trouble.

47:41.139 --> 47:43.334
Hello, Orville.

47:43.909 --> 47:45.103
Wilber?
