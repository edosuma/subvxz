Move over!

03:27.620 --> 03:30.748
So long, Buddy!

04:04.115 --> 04:05.167
Get out of my way.

04:07.243 --> 04:10.380
Want to overtake me!
This will teach you!

04:14.552 --> 04:16.637
Is that you?

04:17.680 --> 04:21.329
I'll kill you!...

04:24.979 --> 04:27.579
Come on, pull out. Come on!

04:29.149 --> 04:32.277
Come on baby! Come on.

05:05.635 --> 05:08.244
Get out of my way!

06:23.840 --> 06:26.452
Oh yeah?

06:39.484 --> 06:42.088
Number three Big Ben
right behind the Kid.

06:42.607 --> 06:45.735
I am coming through!

07:00.333 --> 07:02.418
The race is finished
by the numbers one and three!

07:09.721 --> 07:11.594
Kid still has the belt on!

07:11.600 --> 07:12.845
Ben gets out and goes all the way!

07:12.847 --> 07:15.452
Kid goes through the windshield.

07:15.973 --> 07:18.685
Kid recovers and are at par!

07:19.104 --> 07:22.751
They are tied! They are tied!

08:12.280 --> 08:15.408
Hey... beautiful thing.

09:07.856 --> 09:09.420
The kid... he is still inside?

09:09.629 --> 09:11.506
Yeah.

09:22.141 --> 09:24.122
What's up?

09:24.227 --> 09:26.208
I'm being precautious.

09:26.312 --> 09:27.876
You what?

09:28.397 --> 09:30.066
I just don't want you to take the buggy

09:30.487 --> 09:32.570
before we decide whos it is.

09:32.673 --> 09:34.449
Hey I dreamt the same thing about you.

09:34.654 --> 09:35.696
Yeah?

09:35.905 --> 09:36.739
Yeah.

09:36.747 --> 09:38.827
I dreamt that you took the key
out of the ignition...

09:39.867 --> 09:41.746
...went over to your strongbox,

09:41.959 --> 09:43.415
...put it in

09:43.621 --> 09:46.124
closed it all in the locker.

09:49.982 --> 09:52.067
Right?

09:56.238 --> 09:58.845
Do you wanna play high card?

09:59.369 --> 10:01.453
Aces high.
Whoever wins gets the buggy.

10:05.631 --> 10:07.716
Listen.. you are not driving my tail.

10:08.754 --> 10:10.628
Do you think I'm a cheat?

10:10.837 --> 10:12.609
You are damn straight.

10:17.098 --> 10:19.181
Hmmm, I'll arm wrestle you for it.

10:22.309 --> 10:25.349
- That because you afraid I'm too strong, huh?
- Yeah.. you're damn staright.

10:27.519 --> 10:29.609
There is no need to hate each other.

10:30.336 --> 10:31.690
It is very easy...

10:31.794 --> 10:32.733
I get the keys to the buggy...

10:32.736 --> 10:35.131
When you feel like to steal it,
you come to me.

10:35.444 --> 10:36.799
Hm thats fair.

10:37.949 --> 10:41.491
- Who wants to hang around here?
- Who wants you to hang around here?

10:41.500 --> 10:43.686
Do not fight, muchachos!
I have a marvellous idea.

10:46.294 --> 10:49.416
It would be marvellous..,
...but I can't remember it.

10:53.600 --> 10:55.175
Hey you guys. Can I have a try?

11:38.632 --> 11:41.551
Make way for the big man.

12:04.178 --> 12:06.994
How about a beer and hot dog contest?

12:07.098 --> 12:08.453
How is that?

12:08.663 --> 12:10.122
You drink a beer, eat a hot dog.

12:10.226 --> 12:11.586
You drink a beer,
eat a hot dog...

12:11.790 --> 12:14.814
Whoever quits first pays the bill
lose the buggy.

12:15.860 --> 12:17.004
Okay. Where?

12:18.359 --> 12:21.174
Over there
Looks like a qiuet, cozy place.

13:02.883 --> 13:05.597
- Hey who's the girl?
- How should I know?

13:06.011 --> 13:08.618
You live next door to the park
and you don't know?

13:09.139 --> 13:11.537
If you forefeit, then I win...

14:28.913 --> 14:31.830
A vanilla sundae,
a be havy on the whipped cream!

14:36.518 --> 14:39.021
Good for indigestion.
Try it sometime.

14:49.767 --> 14:50.914
Stop that.

14:51.847 --> 14:54.143
Clear! Get back!

15:07.904 --> 15:10.510
The park is closed...
I mean closed!

15:11.455 --> 15:13.745
Next one to move...

15:38.774 --> 15:40.855
You knew they were going to throw that?

15:41.896 --> 15:45.026
No. Just that the cigars
bother me.

15:48.152 --> 15:50.238
Nice quiet place, huh?

15:51.280 --> 15:54.408
Well it is on weekends.

16:01.714 --> 16:03.801
Hey. You are right behind.

16:09.841 --> 16:12.141
Do you think we outta clear out of here?

16:14.226 --> 16:15.266
Okay.

16:17.354 --> 16:19.434
But then I win.

16:37.791 --> 16:39.876
Get out or I'll smash it.

16:40.607 --> 16:42.587
No. No, Don't smash it.

17:20.641 --> 17:22.726
Do you give up?

17:23.769 --> 17:26.896
You know the story of the tortoise
up against the hare?

17:30.344 --> 17:32.423
Lets continue some place else, huh?

17:35.760 --> 17:37.845
- You know what a tortoise is?
- It is a turtle.

17:38.888 --> 17:40.973
No it's like a bullfrog.

17:44.206 --> 17:46.194
Well... we will pay the bill later

17:46.291 --> 17:49.419
I do not want to hurt
the establishment.

17:50.462 --> 17:53.590
After all, the food is not THAT bad.

17:53.596 --> 17:55.678
Yeah, but the service is a bit shabby.

18:13.402 --> 18:15.904
- Where do you wanna go?
- You 're the driver.

18:16.008 --> 18:18.094
Columbia beer parlor?

18:18.619 --> 18:22.786
No. The hot dogs are too small.

18:22.790 --> 18:24.871
- How about the the bar San Diego?
- Beer is too hot.

18:25.810 --> 18:27.373
Where?

18:27.902 --> 18:29.981
Los Caracolles.
It's a nice place.

18:31.029 --> 18:33.109
You took the words right out of my mouth.

18:38.114 --> 18:40.202
Get out or I'll smash ye!

18:41.242 --> 18:43.327
I beg your pardon?

18:44.370 --> 18:46.459
I said, get out!

18:47.498 --> 18:48.545
What for?

18:49.584 --> 18:52.712
If you don' come out
I got to splat the car.

18:55.840 --> 18:58.244
But why do you have to splat the whole car?

19:00.014 --> 19:02.096
Because I gotta...

19:02.621 --> 19:04.703
What did he say?

19:05.227 --> 19:08.358
He said he gotta..

19:12.008 --> 19:15.130
Now.. does that sound
like a reasonable answer?

19:48.499 --> 19:51.625
Sorry for your car.

19:52.670 --> 19:55.796
Sorry about YOUR car.

20:01.324 --> 20:05.180
When I say pull off a good job...
I mean pull off a good job.

20:05.495 --> 20:08.100
Right, Boss!

20:10.706 --> 20:13.837
I mean no bangling, right?

20:16.858 --> 20:19.465
Alright, Boss!

20:19.517 --> 20:22.228
Get out. All of you!

20:30.466 --> 20:32.551
Well Doctor? Do you approve?

20:33.073 --> 20:35.158
This is a waste of time.

20:35.163 --> 20:37.765
I told you over and over again...

20:38.291 --> 20:41.414
being evil is a virtue

20:42.462 --> 20:46.628
but you must use it properly.

20:48.192 --> 20:51.841
You know very well that I am
bad number, Doctor.

20:51.848 --> 20:54.448
Really quite bad!

20:54.500 --> 20:56.064
I'm so bad...

20:56.116 --> 20:59.245
...that I even give
myself the creepy boo's.

21:01.549 --> 21:05.719
You have a long way to go.

21:05.720 --> 21:08.118
You're afraid of being truly evil.

21:08.119 --> 21:10.204
Thanks to you Doctor, I
have been quite naughty.

21:15.992 --> 21:19.068
I am very sorry, Senor.

21:20.632 --> 21:24.177
Next time.. watch where you
put your feet, you oapf!

21:29.390 --> 21:32.414
These infantile pranks gives you false
delusions of power.

21:32.623 --> 21:34.917
You must be more truly wicked,

21:35.438 --> 21:38.045
if you want REAL delusions of power.

21:44.301 --> 21:47.429
It was an accident! Accident...

21:56.866 --> 22:00.984
Here you witnessed the law of the jungle.

22:01.463 --> 22:02.600
When you trip off the waiter,
because as you are the boss,

22:03.076 --> 22:05.155
everything is honky dory.

22:05.162 --> 22:08.283
But when I trip off the waiter
because I'm not the boss I get stipa dini.

22:09.430 --> 22:11.001
I should hope so.

22:11.516 --> 22:13.506
After all, Doctor
I AM the king around here.

22:16.208 --> 22:17.772
The king around here? The king of what,
The king of this..chicken coop?

22:18.419 --> 22:21.000
King of a few measly protection rackets,

22:22.265 --> 22:23.820
That's small potatoes!

22:25.289 --> 22:27.365
With my professional guidance,

22:27.367 --> 22:29.974
to the deep recesses of your psyke
.

22:30.495 --> 22:32.581
You can really hit the big potatoes.

22:33.623 --> 22:36.647
Do you know why I told you to knock down
the beer house?

22:36.758 --> 22:39.880
So be it. To frighten the boobs

22:39.882 --> 22:43.010
...into paying the
protection money...

22:54.480 --> 22:56.044
Now...
You will listen to my plan.

23:03.551 --> 23:05.121
You must frighten the people,

23:05.125 --> 23:07.201
into leaving the amusement park.

23:12.419 --> 23:14.500
And on this site.

23:15.021 --> 23:17.106
Build a appartmnent house.

23:17.211 --> 23:20.339
Appartment house...!

23:21.381 --> 23:23.154
A skyscraper.

23:26.074 --> 23:28.159
The biggest in the world.

23:28.680 --> 23:30.666
Oh bully bully..
And that will be all mine!

23:30.766 --> 23:32.336
Yours and mine too.

23:33.998 --> 23:36.501
- Yours too?
- I'll get the take the penthouse, huh.

23:41.610 --> 23:44.738
Relax, what's eating you?

23:46.824 --> 23:48.909
You're honking up your
fee, aren't you Doctor?

23:48.919 --> 23:51.426
Hardly!

23:51.526 --> 23:54.133
You know that I deserve it.

23:54.654 --> 23:56.854
With my psychology
you will have more lick in yout feet.

23:59.347 --> 24:01.953
You are King of the Castle...
and you are filthy rich.

24:02.475 --> 24:04.039
And I am 10% filthy rich.

25:22.040 --> 25:25.162
I do not understand,
It never happened before.

25:25.683 --> 25:27.247
It was destiny.

25:47.684 --> 25:49.665
One thing I can't stand is a bully.

25:51.751 --> 25:55.296
A bully!
How about a pain in the neck.

26:01.656 --> 26:04.784
The guys who wrecked our buggy were bullies
.

26:05.827 --> 26:06.870
You don't say...

26:24.602 --> 26:26.681
- You know what?
- No, I couldn't care less.

26:26.890 --> 26:30.539
Do you know what? I'll tell you.

26:30.644 --> 26:33.772
Since the buggy is gone,
why do not you take your truck,

26:33.871 --> 26:34.816
and roll out of here?

26:35.018 --> 26:36.484
Okay, I going.

26:44.194 --> 26:46.696
I am going straight to the bullies..

26:46.791 --> 26:48.355
And ask them for a brand new buggy.

26:49.919 --> 26:51.692
A brand new buggy!

26:55.654 --> 26:56.697
I am going.

26:58.052 --> 27:00.346
- What are you waiting for?
- For you.

27:00.356 --> 27:03.162
You're not studying,
the chorus are not taking to you.

27:03.266 --> 27:06.820
You sound like a bullfrog.

27:07.020 --> 27:12.233
Why aren't you coming?

27:14.840 --> 27:17.551
Too much trouble... trouble

27:17.603 --> 27:19.167
job job.

27:24.548 --> 27:28.197
But... If I get the buggy
back, it's all mine.

27:29.761 --> 27:31.847
Get the buggy from them.. fat chance.

27:33.515 --> 27:36.643
It is all mine?

27:37.164 --> 27:41.335
- I have to study my part.
- Then it is all mine.

27:46.342 --> 27:48.947
- Hey but you do not know who wrecked the auto.
- I know, I know.

27:52.606 --> 27:54.161
Real mean guy.

27:54.682 --> 27:59.895
Very... very mean.

29:44.688 --> 29:48.337
- May I have the pleasure?
- The pleasure is all yours.

31:08.104 --> 31:11.033
Boss!

31:11.233 --> 31:12.797
Those two guys from this morning
were trying to get in, but...

31:12.901 --> 31:16.029
I kicked them out...

31:16.030 --> 31:17.950
Relax, we will be right
back for the next dance.

31:18.116 --> 31:19.680
- Get rid of them!
- Relax.

31:22.808 --> 31:24.793
Don't bother.
We're leaving anyway,

31:24.893 --> 31:26.979
after a word with you.

31:27.708 --> 31:31.358
- We wanna have three words with you.
- Four.

31:31.879 --> 31:34.486
- Why four?
- We want our buggy.

31:35.007 --> 31:37.614
Yeah, thats four words:
We want our buggy!

31:39.074 --> 31:42.202
Buggy? What buggy?

31:42.213 --> 31:44.298
The car you wrecked us?

31:44.350 --> 31:46.957
Now.. you shouldn't have done that, sir.

31:46.958 --> 31:48.731
We were very attached to it.

31:51.129 --> 31:54.257
Do you realize who you are talking to?

32:01.556 --> 32:03.850
He means well,
it'is just that he is allergic...

32:07.291 --> 32:09.376
Tell him.

32:12.504 --> 32:14.590
I don't think you know who I am.

32:16.884 --> 32:18.969
You're the guy who wrecked our buggy.

32:18.980 --> 32:20.648
Your are gonna buy us a new one.

32:20.752 --> 32:22.733
Right, Boss! Sorry!

32:25.549 --> 32:27.634
This here is our name
and address.

32:28.677 --> 32:30.762
We want it just like it was.

32:31.805 --> 32:32.890
A brand new dune buggy.

32:33.100 --> 32:36.284
You may have the courtesy to
to deliver it at home.

32:37.018 --> 32:39.947
You got until noon tomorrow.

32:40.147 --> 32:42.232
Otherwise?

32:53.180 --> 32:56.309
- Otherwise we get mad.
- Heh, we'll get mad.

33:05.067 --> 33:08.195
Oh by the way do not forget...
Not just any dune buggy.

33:08.206 --> 33:09.978
It gotta be red
with a yellow tarp.

33:19.468 --> 33:23.951
Your're not thinking off giving in to them?

33:30.937 --> 33:32.501
You got the psychology
all mixed up.

33:36.150 --> 33:38.444
Listen to the wisdom of this
Professor Freud!

33:39.800 --> 33:43.971
These two here are just kids

33:44.179 --> 33:46.265
they are undergrown men
they think you're their father figure.

33:46.578 --> 33:48.767
You are the father they want
their little toy back.

33:50.227 --> 33:51.791
They want their little dune buggy.

33:52.938 --> 33:55.545
And is daddy going to give them back
their little dune buggy?

34:00.341 --> 34:02.327
You must be the strong father.

34:02.427 --> 34:05.033
You slap tkhem, you slap
them, you slap them good,

34:08.161 --> 34:10.246
Then you will have two
nice obedient children.

34:11.290 --> 34:13.375
Attila, get them!

35:34.571 --> 35:36.656
Did you have to wave to him?

35:36.667 --> 35:39.795
I was only being polite.

36:13.683 --> 36:17.332
Boy she was realy dirty, wasn't she?

36:17.333 --> 36:19.419
Yeah, I don't have time to clean it.

36:19.427 --> 36:21.827
I don't think they got the point
that we want our buggy back.

36:25.162 --> 36:27.239
So we have to set them straight.

37:50.135 --> 37:51.699
It think he got the point this time.

37:56.912 --> 37:58.998
Hey.. I said I think he
got the point this time.

38:00.875 --> 38:02.647
- What do you think?
- I doubt it.

38:16.724 --> 38:19.330
- What do you think of a drink?
- Oh yeah.

39:09.902 --> 39:12.509
Your change.

39:14.594 --> 39:15.637
Try your strength, senor.

39:20.329 --> 39:22.936
- I don't get nothing?
- You didn't make it go around.

40:03.393 --> 40:05.791
Choose your prize senor.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.606
That's a lot of muscle,
I wont be easy to get your point at last.

40:15.071 --> 40:16.635
That guy got muscle.

40:18.199 --> 40:20.806
Try your strength!

40:21.327 --> 40:23.213
A prize for each round.

40:23.413 --> 40:25.915
- Want to try, senor?
- Yeah.

41:03.557 --> 41:06.477
Six! I got no more prizes!

41:26.497 --> 41:29.104
- I say he got the point.
- I say he didn't.

41:29.625 --> 41:32.023
When I say he got he got it.
You got it?

41:32.232 --> 41:33.796
So why are we tailing him?

41:34.110 --> 41:36.195
I'm not tailing him,
I'm following you, you idiot.

41:45.058 --> 41:46.698
Incidentally,
what am I following you for?

41:50.793 --> 41:53.608
Two guesses...

41:54.964 --> 41:56.841
I've got it.

42:03.827 --> 42:05.912
After you. Just get in.

42:25.098 --> 42:26.662
What is going on?

42:26.663 --> 42:28.749
Come on in, the water is fine.

42:42.512 --> 42:45.432
Yeah the water is fine.
What do you worry about?

42:49.603 --> 42:51.167
Everything.

43:00.447 --> 43:02.741
- He didn't do it on purpose.
- I did it on purpose.

43:06.703 --> 43:08.580
Me too!

43:30.998 --> 43:33.084
No don't do it!

43:34.648 --> 43:36.733
I told you not to!

43:45.388 --> 43:48.516
Pull up your two!

44:14.062 --> 44:15.626
Not the arm!

45:11.620 --> 45:14.748
Not now.

45:47.593 --> 45:51.764
Not now.

46:39.729 --> 46:41.814
You knew all the while this was a setup?

46:50.156 --> 46:52.241
Up you go!

46:54.952 --> 46:58.080
You will get that buggy tomorrow
at twelve o'clock.

47:00.166 --> 47:02.251
Wait, we are not through yet.

47:02.252 --> 47:04.338
Not just any dune buggy.

47:04.339 --> 47:06.841
It gotta be red with a yellow top.

47:33.952 --> 47:37.080
The dune buggy you want.. It has to be red?

47:41.251 --> 47:44.066
- And the top has to be yellow?
- That's right.

48:09.821 --> 48:11.906
It took me all night
to pull it together.

48:17.746 --> 48:19.831
Is a little bit old fashioned,
but...

48:20.248 --> 48:21.708
it's not too expensive.

48:38.600 --> 48:40.691
You better take this dune buggy

48:40.998 --> 48:43.188
and not fool around with
with those peoples.

48:43.292 --> 48:44.856
I know what I'm about to talk.

48:44.866 --> 48:45.909
In my days...

48:51.018 --> 48:52.582
I was a big gangster.

48:53.312 --> 48:55.919
Easy, Jeremiah.

48:56.441 --> 48:59.047
Well... It came after the boss.

49:01.446 --> 49:03.531
I was a cook in his favorite restaurant.

49:03.635 --> 49:06.242
That's better.

49:06.763 --> 49:09.370
- How come you know that?
- You told me a thousand times.

49:15.105 --> 49:17.816
The golden boy is up early this morming.

49:17.868 --> 49:20.371
Want a spot of tea, old chap?

49:20.423 --> 49:22.508
Yes, and some garlic bread.

49:23.551 --> 49:25.219
No... As well.

49:34.499 --> 49:36.063
- Hey where are you going?
- Over there.

49:36.585 --> 49:39.713
After a hard day
the body needs relaxation.

49:40.756 --> 49:43.436
Don't forget that we are expecting
company at twelve o'clock, huh?

50:01.610 --> 50:03.695
Why do you have to leave?

50:04.634 --> 50:07.133
Because they are gonna build a
a skyscraper on this site.

50:11.098 --> 50:13.184
I mean you are going away and I
am staying?

50:13.705 --> 50:15.791
A huh.. thats about it.

50:16.312 --> 50:17.876
And to think going out with me

50:17.887 --> 50:20.493
is not something that happens
everyday.

50:21.536 --> 50:24.664
I mean I'm sorry I have to leave..because
I was born here.

50:25.811 --> 50:27.375
Who knows where I'll end up.

50:29.252 --> 50:30.816
Up in the wheel.

50:31.233 --> 50:35.300
Around around it goes. And getting something
out of this, thats our business, right?

50:38.428 --> 50:40.513
Let's hope they don't see us.

50:43.537 --> 50:46.144
It's no harm just to take
a look around, is it?

50:51.879 --> 50:53.443
No don't do that.

50:53.964 --> 50:55.528
The park is supposed to be closed.

50:55.841 --> 50:58.239
They blow it up otherwise
Thats what they said.

50:58.969 --> 51:01.368
Will you run a ferris wheel
with no music?

51:35.665 --> 51:38.272
We will be there in two minutes,
boss.

51:39.315 --> 51:40.879
Excellent... Mind you, though...

51:41.713 --> 51:43.903
At noon exactly... You get me?

51:49.742 --> 51:52.244
Super idea you had, Doctor.

51:52.348 --> 51:54.434
With this here two way radio

51:54.955 --> 51:57.458
we can follow the fun
by remote control.

51:57.979 --> 52:01.212
And at high noon we will go
full cycle.

52:05.904 --> 52:10.387
Technology, efficiency,
organization!

52:14.245 --> 52:16.852
You can't fool society if you
sound like a pussy cat

52:18.312 --> 52:19.980
I sound like a pussy cat?

52:28.426 --> 52:30.512
Listen to the roar of the 20th century.

52:40.417 --> 52:43.546
There they are. I told you
they would come after us.

52:43.650 --> 52:45.735
No, they are coming after me.

52:48.968 --> 52:51.053
It's nothing to worry about.

52:51.574 --> 52:53.660
I'll see you later. Ten minutes.

53:31.197 --> 53:32.761
It's twelve noon.

53:34.325 --> 53:38.913
We have come to deliver a red dune
with a yellow tarp.

53:59.351 --> 54:00.393
Where is it?

54:02.791 --> 54:04.356
Right before your eyes.

54:06.128 --> 54:07.692
Beautiful, huh?

54:13.427 --> 54:14.470
She's a beaut allright.

54:23.854 --> 54:25.418
You okay?

54:30.632 --> 54:32.717
They brought our dune buggy.

54:36.367 --> 54:38.973
- Yeah beautiful. Thanks a lot.
- Thanks, yeah.

54:43.144 --> 54:45.751
Pretty, ain't she?

54:50.235 --> 54:52.841
Shiny red and with yellow top.

54:54.197 --> 54:56.282
- Just like I wanted it.
- Thats what you asked for.

54:57.221 --> 55:00.870
Well, the boss said:
Give them what they want.

55:00.871 --> 55:01.914
There she is.

55:02.747 --> 55:06.185
That's what the boss said.
You ask for it you'll get it, right?

55:06.188 --> 55:09.838
Right, absolutely right.

55:10.880 --> 55:12.549
Have them try it out.

55:12.570 --> 55:14.968
Go out! Take it for a spin.

55:23.414 --> 55:24.878
What's the matter?

55:24.978 --> 55:27.585
Listen, how do you like the...

55:29.670 --> 55:32.277
I know... not bad.

55:32.902 --> 55:34.888
But I was hoping it would be more...

55:34.988 --> 55:40.201
more... more... You know?

55:40.723 --> 55:42.808
Yeah, me too..

55:43.486 --> 55:46.614
What's the matter?

55:46.624 --> 55:48.710
Can't you tell a good
thing when you see it?

55:49.753 --> 55:51.838
Yeah, that just the point. I can't...

55:51.942 --> 55:53.506
I can't see it!

55:54.031 --> 55:55.595
You can not do that.

55:55.647 --> 55:57.732
What's going on?

55:57.743 --> 56:00.037
Forget about me, Ater him.

56:15.990 --> 56:18.701
- Where was he?
- Over there.

56:32.674 --> 56:34.759
He got my bike!

56:35.385 --> 56:37.470
Tthe inevitable happened, Boss.

56:37.481 --> 56:43.215
Did you break his arm?
His back? His head?

56:43.528 --> 56:45.614
Speak up, man.

56:48.429 --> 56:49.493
What's happening?

56:49.576 --> 56:53.329
I'll take the boys out
for ride in the country.

57:42.441 --> 57:44.527
We're doing fine, Boss!

57:44.537 --> 57:47.144
You can't go wrong with this bumch.
They are all winners.

58:04.106 --> 58:05.670
Sorry about that.

58:28.297 --> 58:31.425
Hey you can't miss this one, Chief
Live from your reporter.

58:31.429 --> 58:36.117
I go down, he starts swinging. I'll duck. He
doesn't see the tree and hits it head on.

58:43.937 --> 58:46.023
What's going on then? What's going on?

58:53.322 --> 58:55.407
He swings, I... whoa ...Kick..and.

58:59.682 --> 59:01.768
Mission accomplished. Over!

59:02.498 --> 59:04.896
Did he break his head, boy??

59:04.908 --> 59:06.794
He went dead.

59:06.994 --> 59:08.074
You are doing great, lads..

59:09.650 --> 59:11.384
He went against the tree, smashing...

59:12.426 --> 59:15.554
Yes, but the loser happens
to be one of our guys.

59:15.659 --> 59:18.161
It's not who wins,
It's how the game is played.

59:26.607 --> 59:29.735
Cut that out,
you're scaring the cows!

59:32.863 --> 59:34.115
What's happening, over?

59:34.116 --> 59:37.660
Keep calm, Boss,
We're flying high.

59:47.774 --> 59:49.038
Hey, what is this?

59:49.130 --> 59:51.736
I think one of your boys
joined the Navy.

59:52.049 --> 59:54.656
Rotten traitor,
I hope he drowns.

59:54.865 --> 59:56.324
I told you before...

59:56.429 --> 59:59.557
your sadistic is a waste of time.

01:00:00.078 --> 01:00:02.163
Carry on,
What are you waiting for?

01:00:02.164 --> 01:00:05.292
Take it easy, General. We are doing
the best we can.

01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:17.596
Let's get the big guy.

01:03:26.430 --> 01:03:27.473
Uh, not the back.

01:05:16.540 --> 01:05:18.000
What's happened. Who's out?

01:05:18.313 --> 01:05:19.877
The show is over, boss.

01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:22.692
The show is over?
You can't do...

01:05:27.385 --> 01:05:29.470
My wonderful scheme is kaput..

01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:31.045
10% of nothing, I get.

01:05:32.609 --> 01:05:35.632
You think you are the big wolf
but you are just a little chicken.

01:05:36.300 --> 01:05:38.802
Where are the others...
Get the others.

01:05:38.907 --> 01:05:41.722
What others? The have all been beat

01:05:42.556 --> 01:05:46.206
I knew it. We should have had
50, 100, 150.

01:05:46.729 --> 01:05:48.369
You couldn't win if you had a whole army.

01:05:49.751 --> 01:05:52.879
Next time I will...
And have it all televised...

01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:54.964
in color.

01:07:01.489 --> 01:07:04.096
There... you are looking at him.

01:07:05.451 --> 01:07:07.537
Paganini...

01:07:09.622 --> 01:07:11.916
The finest exterminator of peoples
on the market.

01:07:13.689 --> 01:07:15.879
He's a one time jolly.

01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:18.068
One shot and you're dead, forever.

01:07:20.049 --> 01:07:22.760
He is what you call a virtuoso.
No klinkers for Paganini.

01:07:23.595 --> 01:07:27.140
The most instrumental member of
the Chicago underworld.

01:07:29.642 --> 01:07:32.442
For absolutely no reason does he part
from his so beautiful instrument.

01:07:32.979 --> 01:07:34.960
A Remington 70-70 repeater.

01:07:37.150 --> 01:07:39.965
It is clever cookie,
Cunning, crafty,

01:07:39.966 --> 01:07:43.094
tricky... and smart too.

01:07:44.658 --> 01:07:46.222
Nothing frightens him.

01:07:48.099 --> 01:07:51.749
He has no nerve,
no heart, no pity. Nothing.

01:07:54.877 --> 01:07:57.484
This Paganini
is my prescription for you.

01:08:00.090 --> 01:08:02.697
Just two birds from his
magic repeater and...

01:08:05.930 --> 01:08:08.015
We have no more problem.

01:08:49.202 --> 01:08:51.705
So.. he don't cost peanuts. But

01:08:52.330 --> 01:08:53.477
what are you gonna do?

01:08:54.832 --> 01:08:57.439
We might just as well bought him the crate.

01:08:57.857 --> 01:09:00.462
One lousy bleeding rotten dune buggy.

01:09:07.345 --> 01:09:09.952
They are playing this double
or noting psychology.

01:09:12.975 --> 01:09:14.747
You give them the dune buggy..

01:09:15.060 --> 01:09:17.251
And they ask you a jumbo jet.

01:09:17.772 --> 01:09:21.734
You give them a jumbo jet and they
want our skyscraper.

01:09:23.508 --> 01:09:24.550
As a hangar.

01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:52.182
- What's that? They are back.
- Who?

01:09:52.183 --> 01:09:53.303
The guys on the motorcycles.

01:09:54.476 --> 01:09:56.040
What's the matter? Are you afraid?

01:09:56.874 --> 01:09:59.481
Scared, huh?

01:10:00.002 --> 01:10:02.522
No, It's just that I don't wanna
ride one of those contraptions.

01:10:09.908 --> 01:10:12.515
They didn't give us back the dune buggy.

01:10:15.121 --> 01:10:17.728
And so?

01:10:19.292 --> 01:10:21.378
So I'm warning you that I am mad.

01:10:23.150 --> 01:10:25.757
Well I am not.

01:10:25.861 --> 01:10:29.511
If you don't like, you can split.

01:11:06.318 --> 01:11:09.798
Listen there a man dressed in black parked in
that black car parked just across the way.

01:11:11.323 --> 01:11:13.409
Would you describe him as a killer?

01:11:18.101 --> 01:11:19.769
Well, I consider the possibility.

01:11:43.022 --> 01:11:45.003
When the shooting start, the fun is over.

01:11:46.254 --> 01:11:47.818
Leave him alone.

01:11:48.340 --> 01:11:50.321
Will he leave us alone?

01:11:55.847 --> 01:11:57.203
Don't count on it.

01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:02.833
Well. I'll be seing you.

01:12:04.269 --> 01:12:09.298
- Are you gonna take him by surprise?
- No, I'll take him seriously. I'm getting outta here.

01:14:44.870 --> 01:14:46.956
That's enough.

01:14:47.379 --> 01:14:48.728
Let's pick up from eh...

01:14:50.501 --> 01:14:52.586
No. 4, male voices.

01:15:46.182 --> 01:15:48.788
You should have taken him by
surprise.

01:15:54.210 --> 01:15:56.817
I thought you ditched him?

01:16:06.514 --> 01:16:08.600
Pay attention.

01:16:12.771 --> 01:16:15.377
When you get a chance take a look,
up there.

01:16:16.524 --> 01:16:19.131
Would you say you have seen him before?

01:16:30.809 --> 01:16:32.999
How did he get in here?

01:16:33.103 --> 01:16:36.857
He followed me in here
I didn't feel like dying alone.

01:16:41.132 --> 01:16:42.696
Possibly not!

01:18:36.352 --> 01:18:39.167
Go back to your place!
Immediately!

01:20:27.609 --> 01:20:29.486
Got him.

01:20:31.050 --> 01:20:33.135
To your genius
and my wickedness.

01:20:37.494 --> 01:20:40.622
I always like your plans, Doctor.
Especially when they work.

01:21:39.535 --> 01:21:41.829
Have you heard anything like this?

01:21:44.019 --> 01:21:46.104
Do not look at him.
Just ignore him.

01:22:12.693 --> 01:22:15.821
You're not waiting them to throw
him out just like that.

01:22:16.968 --> 01:22:19.471
- Thats enough.
- Don't tip him.

01:22:30.112 --> 01:22:32.713
What wrong?
What's going on, Doctor?

01:22:32.817 --> 01:22:34.903
- That music!
- It's some crazy bastard!

01:22:36.988 --> 01:22:39.595
I do not want any strolling musicians
in my restaurant.

01:22:41.055 --> 01:22:42.515
Throw him out.

01:23:03.994 --> 01:23:06.080
- The hands.
- Whose hands?

01:23:06.288 --> 01:23:07.331
Your hands.

01:23:07.852 --> 01:23:09.938
- Where?
- On the table!

01:23:12.284 --> 01:23:14.369
Now you see him then you see him again.
Who is he?

01:23:14.474 --> 01:23:18.749
Come on. You're supposed to be the big cheese
here. You know him? Come on. Give me the answer!

01:23:19.687 --> 01:23:21.251
Oh yes. I know him.
That's Jeremiah.

01:23:21.564 --> 01:23:26.578
He used to be the cook here.
Super on the dumplings.

01:23:26.778 --> 01:23:30.427
No, no. All balony, no.

01:23:31.418 --> 01:23:34.963
My intuition tells me
this is the real enemy.

01:23:35.067 --> 01:23:37.882
This dumpling maker is the master mind
.

01:23:38.404 --> 01:23:40.385
Without him these two boys
would be like sheep,

01:23:40.489 --> 01:23:42.053
they are instruments in his hands.

01:23:45.494 --> 01:23:47.788
We have to strike at him,
to destroy them!

01:23:50.708 --> 01:23:53.314
What are you mad about?
What did I do now?

01:23:55.921 --> 01:23:58.007
Thank to you,
I got thrown out of the chorus.

01:24:01.135 --> 01:24:03.846
And as if that wasn't enough,
You nearly got me killed!

01:24:07.287 --> 01:24:10.415
- Do you really want me to go?
- You're damn straight.

01:24:11.875 --> 01:24:13.856
You want that buggy.. go get it on your own

01:24:24.596 --> 01:24:26.160
I'll see you around.

01:24:27.515 --> 01:24:29.079
Only by accident.

01:25:27.263 --> 01:25:31.955
No, don't hit me no more.
I do not know nothing. Please.

01:25:32.893 --> 01:25:35.600
Jeremiah! It's me, Ben.

01:25:36.543 --> 01:25:38.003
It is you.

01:25:40.192 --> 01:25:42.173
They beat me
because they think...

01:25:42.351 --> 01:25:45.479
...I am the one behind everything.

01:25:46.365 --> 01:25:48.972
Tell them, Ben. Please.

01:25:48.982 --> 01:25:52.319
I am nobody.
I want no dune buggy.

01:26:42.890 --> 01:26:45.393
What are you doing here?

01:26:45.914 --> 01:26:47.791
Well, I was just passing by...
Heard the music

01:26:48.312 --> 01:26:50.919
...so I said to myself.

01:26:51.128 --> 01:26:52.483
Why don't you have some fun?

01:27:00.721 --> 01:27:02.285
What do you want? Huh?

01:27:04.370 --> 01:27:05.726
Open up.

01:27:06.456 --> 01:27:08.541
If I don't. What's gonna happen?

01:27:10.626 --> 01:27:12.190
Yoú'll get mad?

01:27:13.755 --> 01:27:15.435
- We are already mad.
- We are already mad.

01:27:15.840 --> 01:27:17.925
Oh, that's too bad.
We're having good times.

01:27:18.968 --> 01:27:20.532
I can't let you in.

01:27:21.053 --> 01:27:24.703
You see.. this is a private party
and low class bums aren't invited.

01:27:46.600 --> 01:27:49.102
- Are you really gonna do it?
- Yeah.

01:30:43.235 --> 01:30:46.363
You still mad?

01:30:50.847 --> 01:30:53.870
- Yeah.
- Me too.

01:32:05.088 --> 01:32:08.216
Not the arm! I need it.

01:33:13.489 --> 01:33:15.796
Is it for me?

01:33:15.992 --> 01:33:17.973
- Is there? Is anyone there?
- Nobody here.

01:34:37.740 --> 01:34:40.347
How is this for service?

01:34:40.973 --> 01:34:44.205
- It's better than walking.
- Just don't get used to it.

01:35:11.107 --> 01:35:12.879
Come on out.

01:35:17.050 --> 01:35:18.927
Take it easy old man. It aint nothing.

01:36:10.854 --> 01:36:16.172
Do you mind?

01:36:40.467 --> 01:36:42.709
Being prudent of nature

01:36:45.368 --> 01:36:47.870
and tender of heart,

01:36:48.704 --> 01:36:52.145
we give you these...

01:36:52.980 --> 01:36:55.065
before we... ahh...

01:36:55.899 --> 01:36:59.027
- part.
- Part.

01:37:53.352 --> 01:37:56.898
The park is open! Everyone in.

01:38:24.529 --> 01:38:26.523
- Great, isn't?
- Super.

01:38:26.720 --> 01:38:29.117
Most... extra ordinary.

01:40:17.412 --> 01:40:19.498
Do you wanna play high card?

01:40:26.379 --> 01:40:27.422
No.

01:40:28.986 --> 01:40:30.550
I'll arm wrestle you for it.

01:40:32.010 --> 01:40:33.053
No.

01:40:34.408 --> 01:40:37.015
How about a beer and hot dog contest?

01:40:39.726 --> 01:40:41.082
Where?
