00:14.200 --> 00:16.509
Jack Bauer's undercover
with the terrorists.

00:16.600 --> 00:20.752
They're expecting Jack to help them release
a canister of Sentox nerve gas

00:20.840 --> 00:22.831
in the Sunrise Hills shopping mall.

00:22.920 --> 00:27.072
Do you mean actually let them release
the Sentox? Are you out of your mind?

00:27.160 --> 00:31.199
We're monitoring them, We're certain
that when they leave the mall,

00:31.280 --> 00:34.511
they're going back to
the remaining canisters,

00:34.600 --> 00:37.592
I'll go along with your assessment.
Let them release it.

00:37.680 --> 00:41.434
But you'd better find those other
canisters, or people will have died in vain.

00:41.960 --> 00:45.157
There is still time to stop them
before they murder those people.

00:45.240 --> 00:47.390
We have a directive from the president.

00:47.480 --> 00:50.916
More people could die if these
men don't lead us to the canisters.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.389
If you were Jack,
would you follow that order?

00:53.480 --> 00:55.516
Stand and watch
as they murder those people?

00:55.600 --> 00:58.751
If those were the orders of the president,
I'd have to.

00:59.640 --> 01:02.438
It's reconfigured.
You can activate the canisters.

01:02.920 --> 01:05.718
You'd better hope it works.
What's the code?

01:05.800 --> 01:08.553
Jack, the unlock code
is Alpha, Kilo, Charlie.

01:08.640 --> 01:10.710
Echo, Bravo, Charlie.

01:10.800 --> 01:13.473
Jack, this is a direct
order from the president.

01:13.560 --> 01:17.155
Now, enter the correct code
and let them release the gas. Now!

01:17.240 --> 01:20.312
- Make it work!
- I told you, there's nothing I can do.

01:22.960 --> 01:25.394
We have another way to release the gas.

01:29.760 --> 01:32.797
I stopped the gas,
but some got into the ventilation.

01:32.880 --> 01:35.553
- Evacuate the mall.
- What about the terrorists?

01:35.640 --> 01:37.198
One's dead, one escaped.

01:37.280 --> 01:41.558
Monitor the tracking device in the remote
trigger. The hostile still had it on him.

01:41.640 --> 01:46.077
I managed to activate the valve before I got
away. At least some of the gas was released.

01:46.160 --> 01:49.152
- What do you want me to do?
- Come back here.

01:50.720 --> 01:53.154
You were followed,
You know what to do,

01:55.760 --> 01:58.797
No! Hostile down.

01:58.880 --> 02:03.590
Erwich and the canisters are gone.
We've got nothing here. Dammit!

02:10.120 --> 02:13.396
<i>Despite an attempt
to derail the process,</i>

02:13.480 --> 02:16.233
<i>the treaty was signed today
by President Logan</i>

02:16.320 --> 02:18.550
<i>and Russian president Yuri Suvarov.</i>

02:18.640 --> 02:24.237
<i>Officials from each country are hailing it
as a major milestone in US-Russian relations,</i>

02:24.320 --> 02:28.791
<i>The White House press secretary has called
this a critical achievement in diplomacy</i>

02:28.880 --> 02:31.075
<i>and will set the course for President...</i>

02:31.160 --> 02:33.993
The Sentox gas is genuine.

02:34.080 --> 02:36.674
The test was successful.

02:37.680 --> 02:42.674
I spent a year securing a weapon
that would bring Moscow to its knees

02:42.760 --> 02:47.709
and you waste it
killing a handful of American civilians.

02:50.760 --> 02:53.149
We were betrayed, Bierko.

02:53.240 --> 02:55.037
Someone must pay.

02:55.120 --> 02:57.588
I agree.

02:59.480 --> 03:01.869
You're the one who trusted the Americans.

03:01.960 --> 03:06.351
Nathanson lied to us.
He plotted to turn the gas against us.

03:06.440 --> 03:09.671
Your trust nearly cost us everything.

03:12.960 --> 03:19.479
Since I anticipated this, I secured additional
men and resources at great personal expense.

03:19.560 --> 03:23.394
Have you reconfigured the canisters
with dispersal mechanisms?

03:23.480 --> 03:27.268
- Yes.
- Do it. Nathanson will be eliminated.

03:27.360 --> 03:30.397
Then we will return to our original task -

03:30.480 --> 03:33.199
striking at the heart of Russia.

03:34.440 --> 03:38.353
- Where's Nathanson?
- I don't know where he went.

03:38.440 --> 03:40.829
I swear I don't.

03:56.280 --> 03:58.635
- Yeah.
- I took out Nathanson's man.

03:59.480 --> 04:03.029
- But there is no sign of Nathanson.
- Find him.

04:18.120 --> 04:21.714
- Alpha seven.
- It's Nathanson. Someone took out my man.

04:21.800 --> 04:24.633
- Who?
- I think Bierko's hitting us back.

04:24.720 --> 04:27.188
<i>Destroy all your databases.</i>

04:33.480 --> 04:35.755
I know you're there. Pick up the phone.

04:35.840 --> 04:39.230
<i>Dammit, Jenny,
I need the key card from my wallet.</i>

04:39.320 --> 04:41.470
<i>Look, I'll leave the police out of this.</i>

04:41.560 --> 04:45.678
You and your loser boyfriend can keep
the money, max out my cards, I don't care.

04:45.760 --> 04:47.796
Just give me back my key card.

04:47.880 --> 04:50.075
It's important.

04:50.520 --> 04:54.911
We can't sell the key card.
Why can't we just give it to him?

04:58.400 --> 05:00.960
I'm calling my brother.

05:01.040 --> 05:03.759
- No, you're not.
- What is going on, Dwayne?

05:03.840 --> 05:05.990
I'm handling this.

05:20.680 --> 05:23.114
- Jenny.
- Hold for the president.

05:23.200 --> 05:26.033
Have your people
recovered the nerve gas?

05:26.120 --> 05:29.157
- McGill!
- Yes, sir. I'm here. I'm sorry.

05:29.240 --> 05:33.597
Do you have any leads?
Have you intercepted the terrorists?

05:34.120 --> 05:37.669
No. The man we followed took his life
before he could be apprehended.

05:37.760 --> 05:39.557
Dammit! I put this on you.

05:39.640 --> 05:43.997
If you'd let the terrorists release the
Sentox in the mall, as I agreed to let you do,

05:44.080 --> 05:47.675
we wouldn't be where we are right now,
which is nowhere.

05:47.760 --> 05:49.239
- Mr President...
- Stop!

05:50.320 --> 05:52.629
<i>Stop making excuses.</i>

05:52.720 --> 05:54.756
<i>Take responsibility and do your job.</i>

06:05.240 --> 06:08.391
Although we limited the casualties,
the attack indicates

06:08.480 --> 06:10.843
that these terrorists
intend to make good

06:10.844 --> 06:13.713
their threat to release
the nerve gas on US soil.

06:13.800 --> 06:20.319
Unless we catch a break, we can expect
multiple attacks resulting in mass casualties.

06:20.400 --> 06:23.278
I assumed you'd want me
to start without you.

06:23.360 --> 06:25.590
Just tell me where we are.

06:26.680 --> 06:30.389
LAPD is setting up a perimeter
around the terrorists' last location.

06:30.480 --> 06:34.268
We've activated
satellite and Caltrans surveillance.

06:34.400 --> 06:37.278
But we don't have any real leads, do we?

06:38.520 --> 06:41.956
If Jack followed orders,
we could have intercepted these people.

06:42.040 --> 06:46.989
We don't know that for sure. Jack's field
decision saved over 800 innocent people.

06:47.080 --> 06:49.116
It may well cost us 100 times that many.

06:49.200 --> 06:53.876
We contained the threat and the media's
awareness, which would've triggered unrest.

06:53.960 --> 06:57.635
You tell yourself that. The fact
remains that terrorists are at large

06:57.720 --> 07:01.998
with 19 canisters of Sentox, and we don't
know where or when they'll hit us next.

07:02.080 --> 07:07.234
- We're all aware of the threat, Lynn.
- Then why does she keep defending Bauer?

07:08.640 --> 07:12.792
I want Bauer placed in custody. I want him
brought in here and held responsible.

07:12.880 --> 07:17.078
Jack can be disciplined later. Taking him
out of the field right now is a mistake.

07:17.160 --> 07:20.072
- Don't tell me how to do my job.
- He was authorised.

07:20.160 --> 07:22.549
He works for me.
So do you. I want him here now.

07:22.640 --> 07:27.953
The rest of you, maintain search protocols.
Send reports to my screen in ten minutes.

07:31.680 --> 07:35.912
It's all right. We're all under a
lot of pressure. Let's get back to it.

07:44.120 --> 07:46.315
- Manning.
- It's Buchanan, Bring Jack in,

07:46.400 --> 07:48.516
We weren't able to confirm his identity.

07:48.600 --> 07:51.956
Take his picture, lift his prints,
get him over to CTU.

07:52.040 --> 07:56.238
We've got nothing. We'll have to run him
through NCIC and lnterpol databases.

07:56.320 --> 07:59.835
I just got off the phone.
McGill wants me to bring you back to CTU.

07:59.920 --> 08:01.956
He's on some kind of warpath.

08:02.040 --> 08:06.511
Because I didn't think letting terrorists
release Sentox in a mall was acceptable?

08:06.600 --> 08:09.751
We lost our only lead.
Lynn's looking for someone to blame.

08:09.840 --> 08:12.752
I was appointed by the president.
It was a field call.

08:12.840 --> 08:18.949
I know, and between you and me, I think
you made the right call back at the mall.

08:19.040 --> 08:23.033
- I'm calling the president.
- Look, Jack, the trail's gone cold.

08:23.120 --> 08:28.240
There's no point in fighting it.
Let's just go back to CTU and square it.

08:28.320 --> 08:31.630
- Fine.
- Look, I'm sorry...

08:33.120 --> 08:36.429
but I also have to take your gun.

08:36.520 --> 08:41.469
Jack, don't make this
any more difficult than it already is.

08:43.880 --> 08:45.677
Fine.

08:47.880 --> 08:50.952
- We can't afford to decommission Jack now.
- I agree.

08:51.040 --> 08:54.919
- Well, what can we do about it?
- Nothing, while Lynn's in charge.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.594
He may be in charge,
but he is not in control.

08:58.040 --> 09:00.349
- Ms Raines, you have a call.
- Thank you.

09:00.440 --> 09:03.193
I'll be filtering intel at station three.

09:05.880 --> 09:07.438
Audrey Raines.

09:07.520 --> 09:12.150
If you try to trace this call, or put
anyone else on the line, I will hang up.

09:12.240 --> 09:15.391
- Who is this?
- My name is James Nathanson.

09:15.480 --> 09:18.597
I'm sure Walt Cummings
has already told you all about me.

09:18.680 --> 09:23.117
- You sold the nerve gas to the terrorists.
- That's close enough to the truth.

09:23.200 --> 09:27.273
- What do you want?
- Transfer me to Jack Bauer on a clean line.

09:27.360 --> 09:29.954
- Why Jack?
- That's not your concern.

09:30.040 --> 09:33.555
You're getting to Jack through me.
That makes it my concern.

09:33.640 --> 09:38.509
I'm going through you because I know
you have a special relationship with Bauer.

09:38.600 --> 09:41.751
I know all about you,
which is why I'm counting on you

09:41.840 --> 09:45.196
to recognise an opportunity
when it presents itself.

09:45.280 --> 09:49.558
- What opportunity?
- I can help you find this nerve gas.

09:49.640 --> 09:51.870
How do I know you're telling the truth?

09:51.960 --> 09:54.190
You don't. Now put me through to Bauer.

10:05.440 --> 10:10.355
- This is Bauer.
- Jack, I'm assuming you can't speak freely.

10:10.440 --> 10:14.035
It's Audrey. It's personal.

10:14.120 --> 10:15.951
- Go ahead.
- Thanks.

10:17.920 --> 10:22.072
I'm on the phone with a man who claims
to be James Nathanson, Cummings' contact.

10:22.160 --> 10:25.038
He says he has information,
but he will only talk to you.

10:25.120 --> 10:27.076
- Why me?
- Hang up, Ms Raines,

10:27.160 --> 10:29.151
My phone has a node monitor.

10:29.240 --> 10:32.118
- I'll know if anyone else comes on this line.
- Jack?

10:32.200 --> 10:35.112
- It's all right, Audrey. Hang up the phone.
- All right.

10:35.200 --> 10:39.193
- What do you want with me?
- The terrorists are trying to kill me.

10:39.280 --> 10:43.353
If the terrorists figured out you rigged
the Sentox to blow up in their faces,

10:43.440 --> 10:46.238
why do you need me?
The authorities will protect you.

10:46.320 --> 10:51.792
Cummings isn't the only one behind this who
works in the government. I need your help.

10:51.880 --> 10:54.678
You had me take the fall
for Palmer's assassination.

10:54.760 --> 10:56.830
What makes you think I won't kill you?

10:56.920 --> 11:02.870
Because you want to stop the Sentox gas
being released on American soil. So do l.

11:03.800 --> 11:07.793
- Where are you?
- There's a phone booth south of Moorpark.

11:08.320 --> 11:10.390
Be there in ten minutes or I'll be gone,

11:10.480 --> 11:13.631
- Moorpark. Got it.
- Jack.

11:14.720 --> 11:19.669
Audrey, I'll explain everything
as soon as I get back to CTU.

11:21.760 --> 11:23.751
Thanks.

11:30.400 --> 11:32.675
It's gotta be strange for her.

11:34.760 --> 11:39.751
Audrey. Just yesterday,
she thought you were dead.

11:39.840 --> 11:41.637
Yeah.

11:43.960 --> 11:48.829
I know this is none of my business,
but she's a good person, Jack.

11:48.920 --> 11:51.195
I hope you two get half a chance.

11:51.280 --> 11:52.838
Thanks.

12:00.960 --> 12:03.349
Jack!

12:05.400 --> 12:08.278
Don't fight, Curtis. Don't fight it.

12:12.160 --> 12:14.151
I'm sorry.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.310
- Lynn McGill.
- It's Curtis, Jack escaped,

13:03.400 --> 13:04.719
What?

13:04.800 --> 13:08.110
He got a call. Next thing I know,
he blindsided me and took my car.

13:08.200 --> 13:13.194
- Who called him?
- He said Audrey, but he may have been lying,

13:14.440 --> 13:16.431
Lynn,

13:16.520 --> 13:18.988
We can track your vehicle's transceiver.

13:19.080 --> 13:23.471
I tried bringing it up on my PDA. He's either
disabled or shut down the transceiver.

13:23.560 --> 13:25.915
Curtis, how could you let this happen?

13:26.000 --> 13:30.278
I'll get dispatch on it. One of my team's
en route to pick me up. We'll find him.

13:30.360 --> 13:34.876
You don't know where to look.
Get back. We'll deploy from here.

13:34.960 --> 13:36.996
Dammit!

13:42.440 --> 13:45.830
Chloe, run a triangulation on
Jack Bauer's phone. Find out where he is.

13:45.920 --> 13:47.672
Yes, sir.

13:48.600 --> 13:52.070
Have you talked to Jack
since he's been in custody?

13:52.160 --> 13:54.355
- No.
- He's not in custody any more.

13:54.440 --> 13:56.590
He assaulted Curtis and stole his car.

13:56.680 --> 13:59.353
- Why would he do that?
- Maybe you can tell me.

13:59.440 --> 14:02.352
I don't know where Jack is
if that's what you're asking.

14:02.440 --> 14:05.830
- You have no idea?
- No, but I'm sure there's an explanation.

14:05.920 --> 14:11.916
Mr McGill? We're not getting a signal from
Jack's cell. The SIM must be out of his phone.

14:15.160 --> 14:18.470
- If you think of anything, let me know, right?
- Of course.

14:18.560 --> 14:20.551
Thanks.

14:25.400 --> 14:27.550
O'Brian.

14:27.640 --> 14:31.599
Chloe, what I'm about to tell you
needs to stay between us.

14:31.680 --> 14:34.274
It involves Jack.

14:34.360 --> 14:37.511
What is going on?
It came on my screen Jack's gone missing.

14:37.600 --> 14:40.433
He's following a lead on the gas.
He needed to go alone.

14:40.520 --> 14:44.593
I transferred a call from my station to him.
I need you to delete the record.

14:44.680 --> 14:49.629
- If Lynn finds out we're working behind...
- Believe me, I know. But this is the only way.

14:49.720 --> 14:52.359
There isn't a lot of time,

14:54.600 --> 14:55.589
When did you call?

14:56.360 --> 14:58.669
- Communications archive,
- This is McGill.

14:58.760 --> 15:01.399
Bring up the phone logs
of Audrey Raines' station.

15:01.480 --> 15:03.277
Yes, sir.

15:04.160 --> 15:07.550
I found it. I can't dump just one call.
They're cross-indexed.

15:07.640 --> 15:10.279
- Can't you unlink it?
- No, it would take two hours.

15:10.800 --> 15:13.598
OK, Mr McGill,
the call logs should be on your screen.

15:13.680 --> 15:18.708
Scroll through to station five,
That's the one we dedicated to the DOD,

15:24.080 --> 15:29.359
The only way is to dump the entire log -
all the calls you've made and received today.

15:30.080 --> 15:32.355
Do it.

15:37.720 --> 15:40.075
It's done.

15:40.160 --> 15:42.833
Thank you, Chloe.

15:51.840 --> 15:55.833
<i>...a day to be remembered
as a step forward for the US and Russia.</i>

15:55.920 --> 16:00.914
<i>President Logan and President Suvarov are
expected shortly to deliver closing remarks.</i>

16:01.000 --> 16:03.389
<i>Following this, the Russian head of state...</i>

16:03.480 --> 16:05.914
- What now?
- There's a call you need to take.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.036
It just came in on this.

16:08.120 --> 16:11.112
- And what is that?
- Walt Cummings' phone, sir.

16:11.200 --> 16:14.476
It's been in Secret Service custody.
They brought it to me.

16:14.560 --> 16:17.677
The caller's claiming he has the Sentox gas.

16:18.680 --> 16:20.955
- Is someone tracing the call?
- They can't.

16:21.040 --> 16:24.191
It's being sent through multiple relays.

16:26.880 --> 16:30.634
I'm not talking to a terrorist.
You talk to them, find out what he wants.

16:30.720 --> 16:34.713
Mr President,
he's demanding to speak with you.

16:46.680 --> 16:49.353
All right. But put him on speaker.

16:55.720 --> 16:58.029
This is President Logan. Is this Erwich?

16:58.120 --> 17:01.271
Ivan Erwich is no longer with us,
Mr President.

17:01.360 --> 17:05.592
His attack on your shopping mall
was unsanctioned and unwarranted.

17:05.680 --> 17:08.717
It didn't serve our interests.

17:10.560 --> 17:17.397
- What is it you want?
- To release the Sentox nerve gas on Moscow.

17:17.480 --> 17:23.669
Since that is impossible, I am forced to strike
at Russia on foreign soil, with your help.

17:24.319 --> 17:28.233
- My help?
- I want the route of Suvarov's motorcade,

17:28.319 --> 17:34.316
His entire route to the airport, along
with a full profile of his security detail,

17:35.400 --> 17:39.712
- I don't personally have that information.
- Then get it,

17:39.800 --> 17:41.916
Make no mistake, Mr President,

17:42.400 --> 17:47.394
it's our Russian oppressors I mean to hurt,
not your people.

17:47.480 --> 17:50.040
However, if you refuse to cooperate,

17:50.120 --> 17:53.032
I will have no choice
but to release all of the Sentox gas

17:53.120 --> 17:57.511
in areas far more populated
than your shopping mall.

17:58.720 --> 18:03.794
You just said that killing Americans
didn't serve your interests. This...

18:03.880 --> 18:07.793
- This would be senseless murder.
- Yes. It would.

18:07.880 --> 18:09.871
So give me Suvarov's route.

18:09.960 --> 18:13.669
- I'll need some time.
- You have 15 minutes.

18:13.760 --> 18:16.069
I'm not sure...

18:23.240 --> 18:26.152
He wants to assassinate Suvarov.

18:28.360 --> 18:30.749
We can't let that happen.

18:32.600 --> 18:36.434
If the Russian president is killed on US soil

18:36.520 --> 18:38.909
it wouldn't just nullify the treaty,

18:39.000 --> 18:42.993
it would destroy
our relationship with Moscow.

18:46.640 --> 18:51.156
- Get me Suvarov's route from Secret Service.
- Mr President...

18:51.240 --> 18:53.435
I haven't made any decision yet, Mike,

18:53.520 --> 18:59.595
but whatever I decide, I better have the route
in hand when he calls back, don't you think?

19:01.440 --> 19:03.192
Yes, sir.

19:21.160 --> 19:24.516
Somebody's screwing with me, Bill,
and I won't tolerate it.

19:24.600 --> 19:28.115
- Screwing with you how?
- Audrey's phone log has been erased.

19:28.200 --> 19:29.553
What?

19:31.000 --> 19:33.560
Take a look.

19:35.280 --> 19:39.034
- Probably a system glitch.
- It wasn't a glitch. She did it on purpose.

19:39.120 --> 19:41.475
- You think Audrey did this?
- I know she did.

19:41.560 --> 19:46.839
- She's one of the most by-the-book people.
- You don't go by the book hiding something.

19:46.920 --> 19:49.912
She was on the phone with Jack
before he attacked Curtis.

19:50.000 --> 19:53.072
I didn't know that. What does that prove?

19:53.160 --> 19:56.436
Something's going on with these two.
What's their history?

19:56.520 --> 20:01.514
You know their history, Lynn.
They worked together at DOD.

20:01.600 --> 20:05.434
- There's more than that, right?
- It got personal later on, yes.

20:05.520 --> 20:08.034
Personal? You didn't think it was important?

20:08.120 --> 20:10.634
No, I didn't. What difference does that make?

20:12.000 --> 20:14.833
When did she find out Jack was still alive?

20:14.920 --> 20:17.115
This morning, with the rest of us.

20:17.200 --> 20:20.078
- You sure about that?
- I was there. I saw her reaction.

20:20.160 --> 20:22.720
- It could've been an act.
- You sound paranoid.

20:22.800 --> 20:26.156
I don't care. From this point,
I want our people on a tight leash.

20:26.240 --> 20:28.549
If someone has a hidden agenda,
I wanna know.

20:28.640 --> 20:31.074
CTU's become too porous. That's your fault.

20:31.160 --> 20:34.470
- I don't need to hear this from you.
- You don't wanna hear this?

20:34.560 --> 20:38.314
Then tell me why
Audrey erased her phone logs.

20:43.520 --> 20:45.511
Slow down!

21:01.520 --> 21:03.750
- I'm here. Where are you?
- In a minute.

21:03.840 --> 21:07.150
I wanna make sure you weren't followed,
or there's no deal.

21:07.600 --> 21:12.230
Take the alley between the buildings across
the street from you, I left the gate open,

21:13.520 --> 21:17.559
Listen to me. I don't know what you think
I can do, but you committed treason.

21:18.280 --> 21:21.238
I don't see it that way. I love this country.

21:21.320 --> 21:24.551
You're never gonna be able to justify
killing David Palmer.

21:24.640 --> 21:29.998
That was an unfortunate necessity. We
admired Palmer, but we had other priorities.

21:30.080 --> 21:33.038
This country needs a reason
to secure its oil interests in Asia,

21:33.240 --> 21:35.310
one Russia and the world can get behind.

21:35.400 --> 21:38.278
I've heard your reasoning from Walt.
It's treason.

21:38.360 --> 21:40.999
<i>No, it's a real politic.</i>

21:43.000 --> 21:45.309
- Do you see the open door ahead?
- Yeah.

21:45.400 --> 21:49.951
<i>Enter it, Make two right turns
and walk back the direction you came from,</i>

21:50.040 --> 21:52.838
Hold on.

21:57.200 --> 22:01.591
You have hostiles coming from the adjacent
parking structure. Do you have a weapon?

22:01.680 --> 22:03.159
- Yes.
- Where are you?

22:03.240 --> 22:06.710
- Second floor.
- Make your way to the roof. Stay on the line.

22:06.800 --> 22:08.199
All right.

22:12.760 --> 22:15.672
- All right, I understand.
- Audrey.

22:15.760 --> 22:20.276
DOD wants a fuller explanation about the
mall. I told them we're trying to find the gas.

22:20.360 --> 22:24.035
I just spent the last five minutes
getting grilled by Lynn.

22:24.120 --> 22:27.874
- About what?
- You and Jack. Your relationship.

22:27.960 --> 22:30.394
- What did you tell him?
- The truth.

22:30.480 --> 22:33.278
That you and he were involved,
but now I'm not sure.

22:33.360 --> 22:35.874
- That's not his business.
- He thinks it is.

22:35.960 --> 22:41.273
He thinks you had something
to do with Jack breaking from custody.

22:42.640 --> 22:45.871
- Did you?
- Not exactly.

22:48.280 --> 22:52.512
- What the hell does that mean?
- A man claiming to be Nathanson called here.

22:52.600 --> 22:56.832
He said he had information on the terrorists,
that he would only give it to Jack.

22:56.920 --> 23:01.869
- Why didn't you tell me about this?
- I was afraid. I didn't know what to do, Bill.

23:01.960 --> 23:05.077
So Jack's meeting this man alone,
without backup. Where?

23:05.160 --> 23:08.197
- I don't know. He dropped me from the call.
- Who else knows?

23:08.280 --> 23:11.636
- Chloe. She helped cover the call from Lynn.
- Audrey.

23:11.720 --> 23:14.518
- Sign here.
- District elevated the threat level.

23:14.600 --> 23:18.991
I'm briefing first responders on multiple
attacks. I need to review DOD protocols.

23:19.080 --> 23:23.551
- All right, I'll send them to your screen.
- We can do it here.

23:23.640 --> 23:27.394
- Unless you have a problem working on this.
- No, no, no. It's fine.

23:27.480 --> 23:29.710
Excuse me.

23:34.640 --> 23:36.471
- Bauer?
- Yeah, where are you?

23:36.560 --> 23:42.635
- I'm in the freight elevator.
- You need to get out now. You're cornered.

24:38.400 --> 24:42.473
- Bauer, where are you?
- I'm almost there. Just keep moving.

25:39.120 --> 25:41.680
Nathanson, stay down!

25:41.760 --> 25:43.193
Stay down!

26:13.480 --> 26:15.391
Nathanson!

26:18.800 --> 26:22.998
Look at me. Look at me.
How do I find the canisters of Sentox?

26:23.080 --> 26:25.230
How do I find the canisters?

26:25.320 --> 26:27.470
In my pocket.

26:35.160 --> 26:39.278
What's on the chip?
Please! What's on the chip?

26:53.600 --> 26:56.910
- He's dead, but there was someone else.
- Who?

26:57.000 --> 27:00.834
I don't know, but he took out three of my men
and disabled the helicopter.

27:00.920 --> 27:04.595
Nathanson may have given him information
that compromises us.

27:04.680 --> 27:07.399
<i>Keep looking until you find him.</i>

27:10.720 --> 27:13.712
<i>Critics have said
by signing this treaty,</i>

27:13.800 --> 27:17.156
<i>we as the United States
are taking on our allies ' enemies</i>

27:17.240 --> 27:19.390
<i>as well as having to deal with our own.</i>

27:20.400 --> 27:24.313
Diagram seven lays out the hierarchy.

27:24.400 --> 27:27.631
Civil-defence protocols
for each agency are well-defined.

27:27.720 --> 27:30.029
Shouldn't you get that?

27:31.440 --> 27:35.035
- Audrey Raines.
- Nathanson's been killed. He gave me intel.

27:35.120 --> 27:36.599
Uplink the data.

27:36.680 --> 27:42.232
Sorry, Steve, you have the wrong extension.
I'll transfer you to lT.

27:42.320 --> 27:46.632
Overlapping responsibilities
default to federal, then to state.

27:46.720 --> 27:50.952
- O'Brian.
- It's Jack. What's the hell's going on there?

27:51.040 --> 27:55.955
It's Lynn, he's shadowing her. He thinks she's
been talking to you, which I guess she has.

27:56.040 --> 27:59.316
Listen. I have a ThumbDrive
that's gonna help find the Sentox.

27:59.400 --> 28:02.836
- I need you to data-mine the files.
- Upload the drive to my socket.

28:02.920 --> 28:05.036
Access code 5J55J.

28:05.120 --> 28:06.473
Hold on.

28:10.400 --> 28:14.439
You should be getting it now.
Chloe, I need you to keep this under the radar.

28:14.520 --> 28:16.511
You mean keep it from Lynn.

28:16.600 --> 28:19.160
Until we know what we've got.
My number come up?

28:19.240 --> 28:21.515
- Yeah.
- OK. I had to switch out phones.

28:21.600 --> 28:25.115
- If you need me, call me on that number.
- OK, I will.

28:52.760 --> 28:56.230
Suvarov's motorcade route
and security detail.

28:56.320 --> 28:58.436
Sir,

28:58.520 --> 29:01.671
if President Suvarov is killed
and the Russians find out

29:01.760 --> 29:04.877
we supplied his killers with this information,

29:04.960 --> 29:07.758
it would be considered an act of war.

29:07.840 --> 29:10.070
The motorcade has a security force.

29:10.160 --> 29:15.871
I see no reason to believe
that the terrorists would even be successful.

29:15.960 --> 29:20.909
Maybe we should have an analysis done,
determine vulnerable points along the route.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.912
Sir, we can't do that
without giving away the fact

29:24.000 --> 29:26.878
that we had advance knowledge of an attack.

29:27.880 --> 29:29.916
What attack?

29:34.040 --> 29:37.396
It's nothing that you need
to be concerned about.

29:37.920 --> 29:40.798
Charles, you invited me into this circle.

29:40.880 --> 29:43.030
What attack?

29:51.160 --> 29:54.789
The terrorists want
the Suvarovs' motorcade route.

29:54.880 --> 30:00.352
They've threatened to deploy
more Sentox gas if I don't give it to them.

30:01.360 --> 30:04.670
You're not seriously considering it, are you?

30:08.080 --> 30:12.756
Martha, Charles believes an assault
on the Suvarovs has a good chance...

30:12.840 --> 30:17.038
Will you please
let the president speak for himself?

30:19.480 --> 30:21.948
May we have a moment?

30:39.040 --> 30:42.032
- Charles.
- Martha, please.

30:42.120 --> 30:44.680
If I don't give them the information they want,

30:44.760 --> 30:49.788
tens of thousands of Americans will die
on our soil, maybe hundreds of thousands.

30:49.880 --> 30:55.477
All right. Charles, there's got to be another
way. Change their itinerary. Delay Suvarov.

30:55.560 --> 30:58.950
It's all over the news
that they're leaving after the statement.

30:59.040 --> 31:02.555
If there's any deviation,
the terrorists will know I alerted them.

31:02.640 --> 31:07.953
Charles, what are you telling me? That we will
stand in front of the world with the Suvarovs,

31:08.040 --> 31:11.191
you'll look him in the eye
knowing you're sending them...

31:11.280 --> 31:15.671
If we were in Russia and Suvarov got this
ultimatum, do you think he would spare us?

31:15.760 --> 31:20.038
I'm not talking about Russia
or about Suvarov. I am talking about you.

31:20.120 --> 31:22.953
You are the President
of the United States of America.

31:23.040 --> 31:25.918
My God, Charles!
You're talking about murder!

31:26.000 --> 31:31.233
Martha, my back is up against the wall.
You... Give me another solution.

31:31.320 --> 31:35.108
You stand up to them.
Refuse to negotiate with them.

31:35.200 --> 31:39.637
Isn't that the policy of this country?
Isn't that the point of the treaty you signed?

31:39.720 --> 31:42.678
It's not that simple, Martha.

31:42.760 --> 31:44.671
It never is.

31:58.560 --> 32:01.199
Dammit!

32:05.200 --> 32:07.430
- Buchanan.
- This is Chloe,

32:07.520 --> 32:09.988
- What is it?
- Jack just sent me the data he got.

32:10.080 --> 32:12.913
My filters weren't working
and I just realised why.

32:13.000 --> 32:15.434
- The drive's DOD-formatted,
- DOD?

32:15.520 --> 32:18.717
I don't know how Nathanson
got a highly classified D-drive.

32:18.800 --> 32:21.314
Audrey's the only one with clearance,

32:22.320 --> 32:25.357
- Lynn's got her tied up.
- Exactly,

32:25.440 --> 32:28.512
- How much time do you need?
- To decrypt it? Three minutes.

32:28.600 --> 32:30.591
Hang on.

32:32.360 --> 32:34.669
Lynn, do you have a minute?

32:37.480 --> 32:41.359
- What is it?
- You were inquiring about the phone logs.

32:42.120 --> 32:43.394
That's right.

32:43.480 --> 32:48.349
I had Felson run a diagnostic
to trace the terminal that dumped the log.

32:52.880 --> 32:56.190
We can key in the user ID
from your office to find what we need.

32:56.280 --> 32:59.317
We just have to use your key card.

32:59.400 --> 33:04.679
- Why are you so interested in this?
- I'm serious about all breaches of security.

33:05.480 --> 33:07.869
- What was that?
- What?

33:07.960 --> 33:11.794
- That last window you closed. What was it?
- It was just the DOD protocols.

33:11.880 --> 33:15.555
- What is going on here?
- Will you please just calm down?

33:15.640 --> 33:19.235
Don't tell me to calm down.
You're up to something. I won't stand for it.

33:19.320 --> 33:21.993
You're protecting her, she's protecting Bauer.

33:22.080 --> 33:23.718
- I can explain.
- So can l.

33:23.800 --> 33:27.076
- This was an attempt to circumvent me.
- We are on the same side.

33:27.160 --> 33:30.789
If your father wasn't secretary of defense,
I'd have you thrown out.

33:30.880 --> 33:33.110
I don't have that problem with you.

33:34.120 --> 33:37.556
Can I have security to station five, please?
Right away.

33:37.640 --> 33:41.315
- What are you doing, Lynn?
- Place him in custody. Take him to Holding.

33:41.400 --> 33:44.631
- You are making a mistake.
- Audrey.

33:51.640 --> 33:53.437
I want everyone's attention.

33:53.520 --> 33:57.638
I'm putting a section two-three redundancy
into effect as of this moment.

33:57.720 --> 34:01.110
Your stations will be mirrored
and monitored through my office.

34:01.200 --> 34:03.270
Now get back to work.

34:04.280 --> 34:08.670
We need Bill to get through this. You are
jeopardising our chances of finding that gas.

34:08.760 --> 34:11.353
I'll make DOD
and the secretary of defense aware.

34:11.440 --> 34:17.436
Don't threaten me, Ms Raines. I promise
you, you do not want to threaten me.

34:36.760 --> 34:39.831
- What have you got?
- A company called Terra-Dyne.

34:39.920 --> 34:44.118
Over three years they've acquired
over 100 pounds of raw strontium isotope,

34:44.199 --> 34:46.190
used to create Sentox nerve gas.

34:46.280 --> 34:51.991
- Where do I find Terra-Dyne?
- La Canada. It's a subsidiary of Omicron.

34:52.080 --> 34:55.708
- Did you say Omicron? Are you sure?
- What's wrong?

34:55.800 --> 34:59.315
Pull up their roster.
See if Christopher Henderson is on the list.

34:59.400 --> 35:02.597
- Why?
- Just do it, please.

35:04.680 --> 35:06.557
Here it is. Christopher Henderson.

35:06.640 --> 35:10.872
Senior vice president of research
and development. Do you know him?

35:10.960 --> 35:15.636
Yeah, I did once. Listen,
send me the decrypted files over to my PDA.

35:15.720 --> 35:19.190
That's gonna be hard to do.
Lynn is watching everyone like a hawk.

35:19.280 --> 35:21.794
- Can Buchanan help?
- If he weren't in Holding.

35:21.880 --> 35:25.190
- What?
- Lynn detained him for insubordination.

35:25.280 --> 35:27.396
- How can he do that?
- He's losing it.

35:27.480 --> 35:32.031
The president's putting pressure on him
to get those canisters. He can't handle it.

35:32.120 --> 35:35.476
I need the files. You're gonna
have to find a way to get them to me.

35:35.560 --> 35:36.879
I'll try.

35:41.320 --> 35:44.278
- They haven't called yet?
- No, they haven't, sir.

35:44.360 --> 35:46.920
President Suvarov's waiting.

35:50.240 --> 35:52.549
We'll be out in a minute.

35:53.600 --> 35:55.591
Excuse me.

35:59.040 --> 36:01.190
Martha.

36:01.280 --> 36:03.714
Please?

36:03.800 --> 36:06.314
This is a difficult decision for me,

36:06.400 --> 36:10.109
both politically and personally,
and maybe I won't have to make it.

36:10.200 --> 36:13.988
Maybe CTU will find the canisters
before the Suvarovs have to leave.

36:14.080 --> 36:16.640
That's what I'm praying for.

36:17.160 --> 36:19.390
But whatever happens,

36:19.480 --> 36:21.948
I need you to understand.

36:23.320 --> 36:27.393
I do... understand, Charles. I do.

36:27.480 --> 36:29.471
Mr President.

36:36.520 --> 36:40.115
It has been a challenging day,
so I especially appreciate

36:40.200 --> 36:43.078
how professional you have all been.

36:43.160 --> 36:49.190
Your president is fortunate to have such
talented people working for him. Thank you.

36:49.280 --> 36:50.429
Yuri.

36:52.280 --> 36:54.555
Anya.

36:55.360 --> 36:57.874
Mr President,
I'm glad we have this opportunity

36:57.960 --> 37:01.839
to thank you and Mrs Logan personally
for your hospitality.

37:01.920 --> 37:06.232
Mr President, it's been our pleasure.

37:06.320 --> 37:08.675
Yes.

37:08.760 --> 37:10.591
Hold on.

37:10.680 --> 37:12.750
We would love that.

37:12.840 --> 37:15.195
Wouldn't we, Martha?

37:15.280 --> 37:17.555
Yes. It would be lovely.

37:18.480 --> 37:20.675
Martha,

37:20.760 --> 37:23.513
thank you again for being so kind.

37:23.600 --> 37:26.637
I read the text of your statement.
It was excellent.

37:26.720 --> 37:30.713
And congratulations again
on your handling of the crisis at the airport.

37:30.800 --> 37:35.749
Thank you, Yuri.
And thank you for your steadfast support.

37:37.440 --> 37:41.194
Have there been
further developments?

37:41.280 --> 37:43.840
No, no, none at all.

37:43.920 --> 37:46.275
There's always pressure.

37:46.360 --> 37:49.670
- But everything's under control.
- Yes.

37:49.760 --> 37:52.194
Ladies, the photographers are waiting.

37:52.280 --> 37:54.840
Thank you, Mr President.

37:58.840 --> 38:01.957
The motorcade will take
service roads to the 118,

38:02.040 --> 38:04.349
and then to the 5 Freeway South.

38:05.280 --> 38:08.317
- Charles.
- Martha, please, just...

38:08.400 --> 38:10.789
just smile and wave.

38:19.120 --> 38:23.796
The motorcade will take Suvarov
through this downtown corridor.

38:23.880 --> 38:27.634
That will give us our best shot
at destroying all the vehicles.

38:27.720 --> 38:31.838
Tell our people
this is where I want them to strike.

39:01.680 --> 39:04.592
All right, that's it, folks. We need to move.

39:08.640 --> 39:12.599
- Come on.
- Charles. You can't let them get in that car.

39:12.680 --> 39:17.117
- It's not too late.
- Lynn McGill is calling from CTU.

39:17.200 --> 39:20.670
- What about?
- He didn't say. He asked to speak with you.

39:20.760 --> 39:22.591
Excuse me.

39:23.600 --> 39:28.355
I'm afraid I have to say my goodbyes here.
Affairs of state, the pressures continue.

39:28.440 --> 39:30.635
Yes, I understand, of course.

39:30.720 --> 39:33.632
Thank you, President Logan, for everything.

39:34.400 --> 39:37.073
Thank you. Anya.

39:40.240 --> 39:42.196
Charles.

39:49.560 --> 39:50.879
- Mrs Logan.
- Aaron.

39:50.960 --> 39:55.192
I've decided to drive to the airport
with the Suvarovs. You can have a car follow.

39:55.280 --> 39:57.840
We're not detailed for that.

40:00.200 --> 40:04.398
- I'll ride up front.
- No, Aaron. No. That's not necessary.

40:04.480 --> 40:06.630
Yes, it is.

40:10.400 --> 40:13.278
Thank you. Would you...

40:15.600 --> 40:18.194
tell my husband where I am?

40:25.520 --> 40:28.398
I hope you don't mind if I accompany you.

40:29.400 --> 40:32.358
- Are you sure your husband won't mind?
- Of course not.

40:32.440 --> 40:35.113
This way we'll have more time to talk.

40:35.200 --> 40:37.191
I'd like that.

40:37.280 --> 40:42.638
Ma'am, the president is being briefed by CTU
right now, but I left word for you.

40:42.720 --> 40:44.551
Thank you.
