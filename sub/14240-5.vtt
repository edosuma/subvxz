00:27.000 --> 00:27.965
Come on!

00:28.000 --> 00:31.200
No, I can't, I'm late as it is.

00:34.600 --> 00:35.365
Rhys!

00:35.400 --> 00:38.000
You're itchin' to go back
to work, aren't you?

00:40.000 --> 00:41.765
<i>Oh, I'll take that
as a yes, then.</i>

00:41.800 --> 00:45.000
Having you to come home to,
that's the best bit.

00:48.400 --> 00:50.765
Unlabeled Class D artefacts.

00:50.800 --> 00:52.800
- Tosh, I need you to run a full check.
- Sure.

00:52.835 --> 00:54.365
Owen, you can help.

00:54.400 --> 00:57.000
- Happy to.
- Adam, I know how much you love audits.

00:57.035 --> 00:58.165
- It's gotta be done.
- If you could-

00:58.200 --> 01:01.400
Go through the reports,
find out when they came through the rift.

01:01.435 --> 01:04.599
- You okay with that?
- I have been for the last three years.

01:04.635 --> 01:05.165
You're late.

01:05.200 --> 01:08.200
Yes, Paris was lovely, thank you!

01:13.400 --> 01:16.000
Who the hell is this?

01:19.400 --> 01:24.200
Just cos that's what I said to you
on your first day... remember?

01:31.400 --> 01:33.600
<i>Like a nice strong coffee...</i>

01:35.000 --> 01:35.765
Sorry, couldn't resist.

01:35.800 --> 01:38.400
Come here, you!
Good to see you.

01:40.200 --> 01:42.400
Hey, Tosh, you're looking good.

02:04.400 --> 02:06.965
<i>Adam, what are you doing
with your personnel file?</i>

02:07.000 --> 02:10.800
Nothing, just finished updating
details of rift activity.

02:10.835 --> 02:12.917
Any idea when this came through?

02:12.952 --> 02:15.000
It's got a low meson energy reading.

02:15.035 --> 02:17.800
No, I'll keep looking.

02:34.600 --> 02:36.800
- A year ago today.
- Our first kiss.

02:36.835 --> 02:38.200
You remembered.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.565
You okay, Owen?

02:44.600 --> 02:46.600
Er, yes, yes,
don't worry about me.

02:46.635 --> 02:49.200
No, no, it's just, er...

02:49.400 --> 02:51.800
kissing in work...

02:52.600 --> 02:54.600
I wasn't expecting it.

02:55.400 --> 02:57.800
We'll celebrate tonight.

03:08.200 --> 03:10.200
Save it!

03:14.000 --> 03:15.600
<i>Jack?</i>

03:19.000 --> 03:20.200
You okay?

03:20.235 --> 03:21.400
Yeah, fine.

03:22.800 --> 03:25.200
- Did you miss me?
- Were you gone?

03:30.800 --> 03:32.965
Just doing a quick check.

03:33.000 --> 03:37.600
We had rift activity two days ago,
but nothing seems to have come through.

03:37.635 --> 03:40.400
<i>Apart from me.</i>

03:43.000 --> 03:43.965
What's that?

03:44.000 --> 03:45.765
It's a screen-cleaner.

03:45.800 --> 03:47.600
I thought you might like it, um...

03:47.635 --> 03:48.765
Do you like it?

03:48.800 --> 03:53.800
Just what I need. A small rodent
looking at me while I work.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.800
Think I'll call it Owen.

03:59.800 --> 04:02.100
He's like a little puppy,
bringing her sticks.

04:02.135 --> 04:04.400
When's he gonna realise
he's got no chance?

04:04.435 --> 04:05.965
Love's blind, apparently.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.200
He's idolised her for years now.

04:07.235 --> 04:08.717
Oh, leave him alone.

04:08.752 --> 04:10.200
I think it's sweet.

04:10.235 --> 04:12.200
He's happy.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.900
Sorry,
I didn't mean to frighten you.

04:35.935 --> 04:37.800
- How did you get in?
- With a key.

04:40.800 --> 04:41.600
This isn't funny.

04:41.800 --> 04:43.600
Stay back, all right?
Stay back!

04:43.635 --> 04:44.765
Gwen, what's going on?

04:44.800 --> 04:47.200
How do you know my name?
Huh?

04:50.000 --> 04:51.165
I know how to use this.

04:51.200 --> 04:53.400
- Who are you? What do you want?
- You know who I am...

04:56.200 --> 04:59.300
Fine, if you won't tell me, fine.

04:59.335 --> 05:02.400
You stay there.
Don't you move.

05:02.600 --> 05:04.165
Jack...

05:04.200 --> 05:05.600
Yeah, someone's broken into my flat.

05:05.635 --> 05:07.000
He had a key.
He knows my name.

05:07.200 --> 05:11.000
- Because I live here with you!
- Shut it! Shut it!

05:11.035 --> 05:13.600
Can you hurry, Jack?
He's a nutter.

05:15.600 --> 05:19.400
You have picked the wrong girl
to stalk, mate.

05:29.800 --> 05:31.200
- Gwen?
- Stay there!

05:35.600 --> 05:36.165
Jack?

05:36.200 --> 05:38.000
Gwen, it's us!

05:41.600 --> 05:43.800
In here, Jack!

05:48.000 --> 05:50.700
- What's going on?
- You tell me.

05:50.735 --> 05:53.365
Look, he's put photos of us up.

05:53.400 --> 05:56.600
He must have done it while
I was at work. He's deluded!

05:56.635 --> 05:58.400
He keeps saying
he's my boyfriend.

05:58.435 --> 06:00.800
He is. It's Rhys.

06:01.400 --> 06:03.700
I've never seen him before
in my life!

06:03.735 --> 06:06.000
- You've been with him for years.
- See?!

06:06.600 --> 06:07.800
Give me the gun, Gwen.

06:07.835 --> 06:08.965
No! He grabbed me, Jack.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.200
Who knows what
he was going to do?

06:10.235 --> 06:11.565
How can you say that?!

06:11.600 --> 06:12.765
- What have you done to her?
- Nothing.

06:12.800 --> 06:15.100
Oh, come on, I know what
kind of sick games you play.

06:15.135 --> 06:17.400
Pills to make you forget.
Is that what this is, yeah?

06:17.600 --> 06:19.200
Are you phasing me out
so you can have her?

06:19.235 --> 06:21.365
- Stay away from him.
- We're engaged!

06:21.400 --> 06:24.400
I bought you the bloody ring
you're wearing!

06:31.200 --> 06:32.800
Why don't you come with me
to the Hub.

06:32.835 --> 06:34.365
- Who the hell are you?
- He's one of us.

06:34.400 --> 06:38.000
We can check you over. Jack will
stay here and take care of things.

06:38.035 --> 06:39.400
Okay?

06:47.800 --> 06:52.000
Don't let him go. If he comes
after me again, I'll kill him.

06:57.800 --> 06:59.800
Trust me, I didn't do this.

06:59.835 --> 07:01.800
But whatever's happened...

07:02.400 --> 07:04.600
we'll put it right.

07:06.200 --> 07:11.000
Right, well, no signs of long-term damage,
as far as I can see.

07:11.035 --> 07:12.600
Or alien intervention.

07:12.800 --> 07:16.165
But, I must be missing something.

07:16.200 --> 07:21.600
I'm sorry, but it's a mystery to me
why you can't remember Rhys.

07:26.800 --> 07:28.500
Is this really necessary?

07:28.535 --> 07:30.200
She needs to remember.

07:32.400 --> 07:34.400
Where did you meet?

07:34.435 --> 07:36.200
Er, college.

07:36.600 --> 07:38.600
Fancied her
from the moment I saw her.

07:39.600 --> 07:43.600
Not just her looks, you know,
I mean she is a looker, er...

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
<i>Tell me about your first kiss.</i>

07:50.600 --> 07:53.000
<i>Erm, in the supermarket.</i>

07:53.400 --> 07:56.000
<i>I was gonna make her
spag bol, and...</i>

07:56.800 --> 07:59.500
<i>then I realised it,
no bloody garlic.</i>

07:59.535 --> 08:02.200
<i>Can't kiss a girl
with garlic breath.</i>

08:05.400 --> 08:06.800
Do you remember that?

08:07.000 --> 08:09.400
Sort of. It's like I'm...

08:09.800 --> 08:11.900
<i>I said,
I wanted to do something else.</i>

08:11.935 --> 08:14.000
I'm seeing what he's saying, but...

08:14.800 --> 08:18.000
I don't remember how I felt.

08:18.400 --> 08:22.600
Believe me when I tell you that
that is your fiance.

08:23.200 --> 08:26.600
Your memory's just playing
tricks on you, that's all.

08:29.600 --> 08:31.365
...She starts to laugh.

08:31.400 --> 08:37.200
She calls me "Rhys the Rant" and then
she kissed me, right there in the queue.

08:37.235 --> 08:41.365
And I thought then, Jack, I thought,

08:41.400 --> 08:45.600
I'm going to marry this bloody mad woman,
even if it kills me.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.600
<i>Worked out what that thing is yet?</i>

08:54.635 --> 08:55.965
No joy yet.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.400
But you should have a look at
the detail, Tosh. It's gorgeous.

08:59.435 --> 09:01.600
Oh, let me get that.

09:04.800 --> 09:06.400
Have you managed to open it yet?

09:06.435 --> 09:08.565
Er, no, sorry.

09:08.600 --> 09:10.600
I'm not doing very well, am I?

09:10.635 --> 09:13.517
It's gonna be a long night.

09:13.552 --> 09:16.400
Yes, which is why I brought...

09:16.435 --> 09:17.800
some sandwiches!

09:18.200 --> 09:21.400
One for you... and one for me.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.600
Smoked salmon, that, uh,
that is your favourite, isn't it?

09:25.635 --> 09:28.600
How d'you know that?

09:30.400 --> 09:32.365
I'm gonna need a beer.

09:32.400 --> 09:35.000
What, while we're working?!

09:35.035 --> 09:36.565
Oh, yeah, of course.

09:36.600 --> 09:40.600
Yeah, right, relax, kick back,
it's a good idea.

09:40.635 --> 09:43.600
Er, not for me though, thanks!

09:59.800 --> 10:02.400
Don't leave me, Jack.

10:04.500 --> 10:07.100
You'll be okay.

10:19.900 --> 10:20.865
What was that all about?

10:20.900 --> 10:23.900
Temporary amnesia.
Owen's checking possible causes.

10:28.700 --> 10:31.700
Weevil sighting
by the sewer in Rockall Street.

10:31.735 --> 10:35.665
Jack? Jack?!

10:35.700 --> 10:37.900
- Can you see him?
- Who?

10:44.100 --> 10:46.900
I'll drop you off
and check out the sighting.

10:50.700 --> 10:52.500
I could come with you.

10:52.700 --> 10:55.300
It's been a while since
we went hunting together.

10:55.700 --> 10:58.300
I'll be fine on my own.

11:04.700 --> 11:07.700
Go on. Live a little.

11:08.300 --> 11:10.100
Well, as it's you.

11:12.100 --> 11:13.465
Thank you.

11:13.500 --> 11:15.500
Call it a celebration.

11:15.535 --> 11:17.100
Oh, yes?

11:18.900 --> 11:22.100
Adam and I have been
together for one year today.

11:22.700 --> 11:25.000
Right, right.

11:25.035 --> 11:27.265
A whole year.

11:27.300 --> 11:30.500
My stomach still flips
when he touches me.

11:30.535 --> 11:31.900
I've never known anything like it.

11:31.935 --> 11:33.817
The two of us, we just fit.

11:33.852 --> 11:36.776
D'you know what I mean?

11:36.811 --> 11:39.700
Erm, not sure I do, no.

11:40.700 --> 11:44.500
Don't worry.
You'll meet the right girl one day.

11:45.100 --> 11:47.500
Yeah. Tosh...

11:52.500 --> 11:55.500
D'you really think
I look like a rodent?

11:56.900 --> 12:01.300
Come on, we're going to crack this box
even if it kills us.

12:15.900 --> 12:18.100
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

12:24.900 --> 12:26.865
Giving me the runaround, huh?

12:26.900 --> 12:29.100
You picked the wrong day, my friend.

12:33.900 --> 12:36.300
<i>Get out.</i>

12:36.700 --> 12:38.100
Get out, son.

12:38.135 --> 12:39.917
Dad?

12:39.952 --> 12:41.700
Run!

12:51.900 --> 12:53.065
<i>Jack?</i>

12:53.100 --> 12:54.500
Was it down there?
The Weevil?

12:55.700 --> 12:57.300
No.

12:59.700 --> 13:01.465
How did you get here?

13:01.500 --> 13:04.500
I came with you, Jack, remember?

13:05.500 --> 13:08.500
Yeah, of course.

13:09.900 --> 13:11.900
Are you okay?

13:13.700 --> 13:16.700
Jack, what did you see?

13:18.100 --> 13:20.900
My past.

13:27.900 --> 13:30.500
- If what you say is true...
- It is.

13:31.900 --> 13:34.700
We love each other.

13:35.500 --> 13:38.500
But how could I forget that?

13:51.300 --> 13:56.100
<i>Nothing in.
I was gonna take you out for a meal.</i>

14:02.500 --> 14:05.900
Didn't want the weekend to finish,
I suppose.

14:15.700 --> 14:18.500
Jack, please. Talk to me.

14:18.535 --> 14:20.717
What about the past?

14:20.752 --> 14:22.900
Is it your childhood?

14:28.100 --> 14:30.500
I've always been here for you, Jack.

14:30.535 --> 14:32.465
From the very beginning.

14:32.500 --> 14:35.900
I'm the one you can confide in,
remember?

14:37.300 --> 14:39.465
It was meant to be buried.

14:39.500 --> 14:43.300
I buried the memory
over 150 years ago.

14:43.335 --> 14:45.300
Why now?

14:46.100 --> 14:47.465
Well, maybe it's time.

14:47.500 --> 14:49.900
Maybe up until now, your subconscious
has been protecting you.

14:49.935 --> 14:52.500
But you can't block out
the past forever.

14:52.535 --> 14:54.900
I can't afford to remember.

14:59.900 --> 15:01.700
- Jack, talk to me, please.
- Why?

15:01.735 --> 15:04.065
I can help. Trust me.

15:04.100 --> 15:06.700
I'm not sure I should do this.

15:06.735 --> 15:09.265
Just tell me what you see.

15:09.300 --> 15:11.700
I can help you.
That's why I'm here.

15:14.500 --> 15:17.100
Where are you, Jack?

15:31.900 --> 15:34.300
<i>Boeshane Peninsula.</i>

15:34.700 --> 15:37.700
<i>My home in the 51st century.</i>

15:38.700 --> 15:41.900
We lived under the threat
of invasion.

15:43.900 --> 15:46.900
They came without warning.

15:47.300 --> 15:51.700
We thought they'd pass over us,
like they always did.

15:54.500 --> 15:56.665
But they didn't.

15:56.700 --> 15:59.500
- Not that day.
- Who?

16:00.100 --> 16:04.300
The most horrible creatures
you could've possibly imagine.

16:04.335 --> 16:06.617
<i>Their howls travelled before them.</i>

16:06.652 --> 16:08.900
Run! Take Gray. Keep him safe!

16:08.935 --> 16:12.100
- Take Gray.
- Gray?

16:13.100 --> 16:14.900
<i>My little brother.</i>

16:16.500 --> 16:17.865
No, no, Dad. Come with us.

16:17.900 --> 16:21.900
No, I've got to go get
your mother. Run!

16:29.700 --> 16:33.700
One minute, I was holding his hand.

16:43.900 --> 16:45.900
I don't know when he let go.

16:45.935 --> 16:47.300
Gray?

16:47.900 --> 16:49.500
Gray?

16:49.700 --> 16:53.465
Gray! Gray, where are you? Gray!

16:53.500 --> 16:56.900
One minute, his hand was in mine,
I don't know when he let go.

16:56.935 --> 17:00.300
I don't think I noticed, I thought
he was there, just behind me.

17:00.335 --> 17:01.100
Gray!

17:01.300 --> 17:07.300
I retraced my steps,
hoping that I'd see him again.

17:08.099 --> 17:10.300
Did you find him?

17:11.500 --> 17:12.065
Gray!

17:12.099 --> 17:14.000
<i>I ran all the way home.</i>

17:14.035 --> 17:16.367
Where are you? Gray!

17:16.402 --> 17:18.700
Jack, what did you find?

17:27.700 --> 17:29.500
Dad?

17:32.100 --> 17:34.100
No!

17:35.300 --> 17:39.465
Can someone help? Please!

17:39.500 --> 17:42.500
<i>I searched for Gray for years.</i>

17:42.535 --> 17:43.617
I never found the body.

17:43.652 --> 17:45.576
It wasn't your fault.

17:45.611 --> 17:47.500
I let go of his hand!

17:48.500 --> 17:51.700
It was the worst day of my life.

17:52.700 --> 17:55.300
It's the last thing
I want to remember.

17:58.500 --> 18:00.465
So, according to
the molecular breakdown,

18:00.500 --> 18:04.500
this potentially alien complex artefact
is, in fact, made out of wood.

18:04.535 --> 18:07.317
Well, perhaps it fell
in the crate by mistake.

18:07.352 --> 18:10.100
Picked up meson energy
from the other stuff.

18:10.135 --> 18:11.865
Yeah, right!

18:11.900 --> 18:14.700
Oh, yes, sorry,
it's a stupid idea.

18:14.735 --> 18:16.065
I think Jack brought it in.

18:16.100 --> 18:20.100
No, I'm sure Adam found it on
an excavation a few months back.

18:20.300 --> 18:22.465
I'll have a look in the diary.

18:22.500 --> 18:24.265
I like to log the interesting stuff.

18:24.300 --> 18:26.900
You write about artefacts
in your diary?

18:26.935 --> 18:29.100
Among other things.

18:33.900 --> 18:37.500
So, we are done for the night.

18:37.700 --> 18:39.900
I guess.

18:40.300 --> 18:43.865
Everything all right?

18:43.900 --> 18:46.900
- Yeah, just, Adam hasn't rung yet.
- Ah.

18:47.900 --> 18:49.700
Sure he will.

18:50.900 --> 18:55.100
I know I would,
if it was our anniversary.

18:56.100 --> 18:58.065
I wouldn't disappear.

18:58.100 --> 19:01.500
Infact, I would... cherish you.

19:02.100 --> 19:03.265
Ah, Owen!

19:03.300 --> 19:07.300
Yeah, no, no, really,
really, I would.

19:07.500 --> 19:10.700
Infact, I wouldn't let you
out of my sight, Tosh...

19:11.100 --> 19:14.700
because I love you.

19:14.900 --> 19:16.700
What?

19:17.700 --> 19:21.300
Yeah, there we are. I've said it.
I love you.

19:21.700 --> 19:27.500
Yes, I always have, actually,
ever since we started working together,

19:27.535 --> 19:30.065
and in fact, I actually ache for you.

19:30.100 --> 19:33.500
When you're in the room, I want
to reach out and touch you and...

19:33.535 --> 19:34.865
- Owen!
- No, no, no,

19:34.900 --> 19:36.665
I can't keep this secret
any more!

19:36.700 --> 19:39.500
My mum said to me, "Seize the day",
and so I am seizing it,

19:39.700 --> 19:42.900
and I've got so much
love to give you, Tosh,

19:43.000 --> 19:46.700
and you won't know that
unless I tell you.

19:46.735 --> 19:50.365
So here I am, telling you
that I love you.

19:50.400 --> 19:54.000
You know I know there's Adam,
okay, but you know, I think...

19:54.035 --> 19:58.217
In fact, I know that we
would be amazing together,

19:58.252 --> 20:02.400
erm... if you would only just
give it a chance.

20:05.800 --> 20:07.400
Oh, God.

20:10.800 --> 20:13.200
Say something.

20:14.800 --> 20:19.165
That is completely inappropriate.

20:19.200 --> 20:20.765
- Pardon?
- What are you thinking of?

20:20.800 --> 20:24.400
- I'm sorry, I just wanted you to know.
- How dare you! I'm with Adam.

20:24.800 --> 20:26.900
And even if I wasn't...

20:26.935 --> 20:29.000
you're not my type.

20:29.035 --> 20:30.800
Never will be.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.100
Maybe I should be
on my own tonight.

20:41.135 --> 20:43.200
No way. What if you forget
who you are?

20:43.235 --> 20:45.000
I know who I am.

20:46.600 --> 20:49.200
It's not just you
who's lost something.

20:50.800 --> 20:52.765
But you remember.

20:52.800 --> 20:54.565
All you know about me.

20:54.600 --> 20:57.600
You're my girl, my best friend.

20:57.635 --> 20:59.017
Suddenly, all that's gone.

20:59.052 --> 21:00.365
<i>A stormer of a night!</i>

21:00.400 --> 21:03.400
<i>- What about her, mate?
- Where's he going now?</i>

21:04.000 --> 21:06.400
He just walked off!
He knows I'm waiting.

21:06.435 --> 21:08.517
Oh, fine.
I'll help myself, then!

21:08.552 --> 21:10.600
Here you are. Keep the change!

21:10.635 --> 21:12.565
Buy some spot cream!

21:12.600 --> 21:14.600
I'm not coming here again.
It's overpriced.

21:14.635 --> 21:16.600
There's a £1.50 charge
on the cash machine.

21:16.800 --> 21:17.965
It's a bloody disgrace.

21:18.000 --> 21:21.800
Honestly. Kids these days.
Don't know the meaning of hard work.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.800
- What?
- Rhys the Rant!

21:26.600 --> 21:29.365
Always when you're
in a queue, or driving,

21:29.400 --> 21:34.400
or when you're on the phone to one
of those automated phone thingies...

21:34.435 --> 21:38.400
Hey, it's okay. It's okay.

21:43.200 --> 21:45.600
Come on, sweetheart.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
What's wrong?

22:04.400 --> 22:08.200
My... diary.

22:09.200 --> 22:11.400
You're not in it.

22:12.200 --> 22:14.765
Everyone else is.

22:14.800 --> 22:20.200
Why would I leave you out
when you've been here so long?

22:23.800 --> 22:27.200
Like I'm remembering a man
who doesn't exist.

22:36.800 --> 22:39.200
What are you?

22:40.800 --> 22:43.000
Cross me, and I will
fill you full of fake memories

22:43.200 --> 22:47.200
until your head is on fire,
because that's how I exist.

22:47.600 --> 22:49.365
Gwen.

22:49.400 --> 22:50.565
What did you do to her?

22:50.600 --> 22:52.765
Memory is a very delicate thing.

22:52.800 --> 22:55.365
Feeding myself in
wiped other memories out.

22:55.400 --> 22:58.400
It's a side-effect of what
I have to do in order to survive.

22:58.435 --> 23:00.617
Jack has to know.

23:00.652 --> 23:02.800
Remember this.

23:05.200 --> 23:07.300
<i>I know you didn't mean to kill her.</i>

23:07.335 --> 23:09.400
<i>You just couldn't stop yourself.</i>

23:09.435 --> 23:12.000
Remember this.

23:19.200 --> 23:20.165
I didn't do that.

23:20.200 --> 23:24.400
Oh, yes, you did,
and she wasn't the first.

23:29.400 --> 23:30.165
Please don't hurt me!

23:30.200 --> 23:33.565
<i>Good old lanto, loyal lanto.</i>

23:33.600 --> 23:36.800
<i>Roaming the streets at night
for bait.</i>

23:36.835 --> 23:39.165
My... diary!

23:39.200 --> 23:41.365
All human record is a lie.

23:41.400 --> 23:45.000
You twist it into what
you want to believe.

23:45.600 --> 23:48.800
But we know the rot
in your heart.

23:48.835 --> 23:50.200
You crave flesh.

23:50.235 --> 23:52.800
No. Please.

23:53.200 --> 23:55.200
Remember it.

23:57.000 --> 24:00.000
Remember it. Remember it!

24:00.035 --> 24:03.000
Remember it! Remember it!

24:05.400 --> 24:07.600
I helped you dump the bodies.

24:07.635 --> 24:10.000
It's me you call.

24:11.400 --> 24:16.400
You know, I forgot what a rush it is,
feeding in the bad stuff.

24:51.800 --> 24:57.200
Franklin? Franklin, wake up. Please!

24:58.400 --> 24:59.800
Mom?

25:04.200 --> 25:06.200
Where's Gray?

25:06.400 --> 25:08.200
Where's Gray?

25:08.235 --> 25:10.000
Where is he, son?

25:10.200 --> 25:11.765
Where is he?

25:11.800 --> 25:14.800
We were running so fast.

25:15.600 --> 25:19.200
One moment,
his hand was in mine...

25:20.600 --> 25:23.600
No, not my little boy!

25:23.635 --> 25:26.600
Not my little boy!

25:27.200 --> 25:29.000
Why now?

25:29.200 --> 25:31.800
Why now?

25:47.600 --> 25:49.365
Anything?

25:49.400 --> 25:52.400
It's still a bit of a blur,
but I'm getting there.

25:53.800 --> 25:55.800
That's all we've got, really.

25:55.835 --> 25:57.765
Memories.

25:57.800 --> 26:00.400
That's what brought us to here.

26:00.600 --> 26:02.765
To this point.

26:02.800 --> 26:06.200
We found it before,
we'll find it again.

26:07.000 --> 26:12.800
You know, I, um,
I always worried that you'd...

26:15.200 --> 26:17.800
that you'd just
settled for me, you know?

26:19.400 --> 26:24.600
Cos if you met me now, Gwen,
with all that goes on in your life,

26:25.800 --> 26:28.000
could be that you wouldn't
look twice at me.

26:28.035 --> 26:30.400
Don't say that.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.400
- Do you remember that?
- No.

26:43.600 --> 26:46.800
It felt like the first time.

26:49.400 --> 26:51.800
But it was nice.

27:01.600 --> 27:03.400
I like that.

27:03.435 --> 27:05.200
I know.

27:07.000 --> 27:10.000
Remind me some more.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.200
What's wrong?

27:42.000 --> 27:45.200
How far would you go for me?

27:46.000 --> 27:48.600
I need to know.

27:51.000 --> 27:54.000
Would you die for me?

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
Yes.

28:10.200 --> 28:12.200
<i>Jack...</i>

28:16.600 --> 28:18.600
lanto.

28:22.200 --> 28:24.400
What's wrong?

28:26.200 --> 28:28.600
You have to put me in the vaults.

28:28.800 --> 28:30.965
Lock me up.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.800
I killed three girls.

28:34.200 --> 28:35.565
Strangled them.

28:35.600 --> 28:37.800
Stop kidding around.

28:37.835 --> 28:39.800
I'm serious.

28:41.400 --> 28:44.600
I murdered them, in cold blood.

28:45.600 --> 28:48.400
I took their bodies, and...

28:54.200 --> 28:56.800
You have to lock me away...

28:57.400 --> 28:58.400
before I turn on you.

28:58.435 --> 28:59.365
None of you are safe!

28:59.400 --> 29:03.200
Hey, hey, come here,
come here.

29:04.600 --> 29:07.200
What's happened to you?

29:15.800 --> 29:18.400
I'm a monster.

29:25.500 --> 29:27.265
Best lie detector on the planet.

29:27.300 --> 29:30.100
If something's untrue,
the light turns red.

29:30.300 --> 29:32.100
Go.

29:34.700 --> 29:41.300
My... hands on her throat.

29:48.100 --> 29:51.300
And it felt so good.

29:51.700 --> 29:55.900
Squeezing the life out of her.

30:01.100 --> 30:03.900
It reads as truth.

30:04.300 --> 30:06.900
I don't believe it.

30:07.500 --> 30:10.500
Okay, tell me about
the second girl.

30:15.700 --> 30:18.400
She tried to get away...

30:18.435 --> 30:21.100
but I was too quick.

30:24.500 --> 30:27.100
Pleading...

30:27.900 --> 30:31.900
and I... I didn't care.

30:33.300 --> 30:36.300
<i>Something in me wants to kill.</i>

30:36.335 --> 30:39.417
No. This is not you.

30:39.452 --> 30:41.576
Something's changed you.

30:41.611 --> 30:43.855
You're not a murderer.

30:43.890 --> 30:46.100
I'm certain of it.

30:55.300 --> 30:57.300
<i>All human record is a lie.</i>

30:57.335 --> 30:59.517
<i>You crave flesh.</i>

30:59.552 --> 31:01.700
<i>Remember this.</i>

31:04.500 --> 31:06.500
<i>A year ago today...
you remembered.</i>

31:06.535 --> 31:08.300
Do you remember that?

31:13.100 --> 31:14.065
<i>Who the hell is this?</i>

31:14.100 --> 31:17.500
<i>Just cos that's what I said to you
on your first day, remember.</i>

31:21.300 --> 31:24.065
<i>Remember? Remember?</i>

31:24.100 --> 31:25.500
<i>Well, I came with you, Jack,
remember.</i>

31:25.535 --> 31:27.265
Remember, remember.

31:27.300 --> 31:29.300
<i>I can help you
that's why I'm here.</i>

31:29.335 --> 31:31.265
<i>Remember this.</i>

31:31.300 --> 31:34.900
Come here, come here,
just look, look.

31:34.935 --> 31:35.900
<i>Remember it.</i>

31:37.900 --> 31:41.500
<i>Remember it, remember it,
remember it.</i>

31:41.535 --> 31:43.700
<i>Remember it.</i>

31:48.500 --> 31:51.100
Where's Adam's blood sample?

31:58.700 --> 32:00.000
Everything's in order here.

32:00.035 --> 32:01.300
When was it last updated?

32:03.300 --> 32:05.500
Um... 24 hours ago.

32:37.100 --> 32:37.865
Owen...

32:37.900 --> 32:41.300
About last night, um,
it was selfish of me.

32:41.335 --> 32:42.700
Owen, I think the world of you...

32:42.735 --> 32:44.865
I know. I'm really sorry.

32:44.900 --> 32:46.865
I don't want to jeopardise
our friendship.

32:46.900 --> 32:50.300
See, the most important thing
is that you're happy.

32:50.335 --> 32:52.100
Thank you.

32:52.900 --> 32:55.865
Tosh... you are...

32:55.900 --> 32:59.100
you are happy with Adam,
aren't you?

32:59.135 --> 33:01.300
Completely.

33:01.900 --> 33:03.300
Okay.

33:08.100 --> 33:09.065
Hey, how are you today?

33:09.100 --> 33:11.865
Um, things are coming back slowly.

33:11.900 --> 33:13.700
Rhys thought I shouldn't
come into work but...

33:13.735 --> 33:15.065
Hey, we'll look after you.

33:15.100 --> 33:17.500
You just have to give yourself time.

33:17.535 --> 33:20.300
Come on. Group hug.

33:28.300 --> 33:30.500
Hey lanto, come here.

33:33.100 --> 33:34.900
You all right, mate?

33:37.300 --> 33:40.300
Listen, I could murder a coffee.

33:47.700 --> 33:49.465
Talk to me, Adam.

33:49.500 --> 33:52.100
If that's even your name.

33:52.300 --> 33:54.300
- What?
- What are you doing, Jack?

33:54.335 --> 33:55.665
He's not who you think he is.

33:55.700 --> 33:58.300
He's been feeding himself
into our memories, by touch.

33:58.335 --> 34:00.017
Is this some kind of sick joke?

34:00.052 --> 34:01.665
He didn't exist until two days ago.

34:01.700 --> 34:03.500
Can somebody tell me
what's going on, please?

34:03.535 --> 34:05.117
Jack, we've known him for years.

34:05.152 --> 34:06.700
- He is part of the team.
- No.

34:06.900 --> 34:07.900
He just made you think that.

34:07.935 --> 34:09.100
Come on, Jack.

34:09.500 --> 34:11.300
Ah, you don't get to me like that.

34:11.335 --> 34:12.065
Jack, you know me.

34:12.100 --> 34:13.665
You recruited me three years ago.

34:13.699 --> 34:15.900
All I know is, when I think of my team
I see you there,

34:15.935 --> 34:17.500
but I don't feel anything for you.

34:17.534 --> 34:19.864
No pride, no warmth.

34:19.900 --> 34:25.100
You, the one who I can confide in,
the one who unburied the dead.

34:25.300 --> 34:27.900
Jack, maybe you've forgotten him.
Like I did with Rhys?

34:27.935 --> 34:29.917
No, I should have spotted it then.

34:29.952 --> 34:31.864
That wasn't stress. That was him.

34:31.900 --> 34:35.500
By making us think we know him,
he disturbs our real memories.

34:35.534 --> 34:37.100
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

34:37.135 --> 34:38.665
I'm taking him to the vaults.

34:38.699 --> 34:40.300
- Jack, this is ridiculous.
- Move!

34:41.900 --> 34:42.465
No!

34:42.500 --> 34:45.500
- Tosh, that's not gonna help.
- It's fine.

34:45.534 --> 34:48.100
I'm just going to lock him up.

34:49.900 --> 34:50.864
Let him go.

34:50.900 --> 34:52.000
I'm not going to harm him.

34:52.034 --> 34:53.065
Why should I believe you?

34:53.100 --> 34:55.500
Tosh, Tosh, we can talk about this.

34:55.534 --> 34:57.900
Drop the gun, Jack.

34:59.100 --> 35:00.465
Get off me!

35:00.500 --> 35:03.300
This is what you've done to us.
Move!

35:04.900 --> 35:06.500
Adam!

35:11.700 --> 35:15.900
Don't kill me. I had to become part
of your memories in order to survive.

35:15.935 --> 35:17.265
I didn't mean any harm.

35:17.300 --> 35:19.300
- You've changed us.
- For the better.

35:19.335 --> 35:21.300
You didn't remember
who you were.

35:21.335 --> 35:22.865
I helped you.

35:22.900 --> 35:25.700
Look at Owen,
all his cynicism gone.

35:25.735 --> 35:27.300
He's a different man now.

35:27.335 --> 35:29.217
Selfless, happier.

35:29.252 --> 35:31.065
And Toshiko, too.

35:31.100 --> 35:34.300
She's never been this confident.

35:34.700 --> 35:37.665
How did you come here? Why us?

35:37.700 --> 35:43.300
All of you have such unique memories,
specially you, Jack.

35:43.335 --> 35:46.300
All those extraordinary
memories you hold,

35:46.335 --> 35:48.500
some hidden, some absent.

35:48.535 --> 35:50.865
Your singular mind.

35:50.900 --> 35:53.700
That's what drew me here.

35:54.100 --> 35:57.700
Good job. It's what we do best...

35:58.100 --> 35:59.465
wipe out aliens.

35:59.500 --> 36:03.665
You can't shoot me!
You made me live!

36:03.700 --> 36:07.100
And you always remember
what you killed...

36:07.135 --> 36:10.100
don't you, Jack?

36:16.700 --> 36:18.700
Our memories define us.

36:18.900 --> 36:19.900
Adam changed those memories...

36:20.100 --> 36:22.265
changed who we are.

36:22.300 --> 36:26.500
Now I have to help you all go back,
find a memory that defines you.

36:26.535 --> 36:29.465
Rediscover who you are.

36:29.500 --> 36:34.300
If I'm wrong, he'll still be here
when we've done this.

36:37.300 --> 36:42.700
Let me take you back
to before we all met.

36:46.900 --> 36:50.100
Feel around for anything
that makes you what you are...

36:51.500 --> 36:55.700
the hidden and the forgotten.

36:55.735 --> 36:58.700
Tell me where you are.

37:09.100 --> 37:10.465
<i>The college canteen...</i>

37:10.500 --> 37:13.465
<i>Rhys is sitting opposite me,
telling stupid jokes.</i>

37:13.500 --> 37:16.900
<i>Where do you find a tortoise
with no legs? Where you left it.</i>

37:18.300 --> 37:21.865
<i>It's my birthday.
I'm ten.</i>

37:21.900 --> 37:26.300
<i>Mum spends the whole day screaming,
"I love you because you're my son</i>

37:26.500 --> 37:28.300
but that doesn't mean
I have to like you. "

37:28.335 --> 37:29.665
<i>Maths club,</i>

37:29.700 --> 37:32.300
something so reliable
about maths...

37:32.335 --> 37:35.100
<i>always the right answer.</i>

37:36.700 --> 37:43.500
<i>Meeting Lisa, falling in love,
never felt so alive.</i>

37:43.535 --> 37:46.465
<i>I turn 16. She packs me bags.</i>

37:46.500 --> 37:50.100
That is the nicest thing
you've done for me in years, Mother.

37:50.135 --> 37:52.500
<i>Kissing him in the supermarket.</i>

37:52.535 --> 37:54.417
The look on his face.

37:54.452 --> 37:56.265
<i>My first flat.</i>

37:56.300 --> 37:58.065
I don't have a flat-warming.

37:58.100 --> 38:00.100
<i>There's no-one I want to invite.</i>

38:00.135 --> 38:01.865
<i>Losing Lisa.</i>

38:01.900 --> 38:04.265
Like the world had ended.

38:04.300 --> 38:06.900
<i>The way he
looks at me sometimes.</i>

38:07.100 --> 38:12.100
<i>As if he's scared of what
he feels for me, I love him.</i>

38:15.300 --> 38:18.500
But not in the way I love you.

38:19.900 --> 38:22.500
Take this.

38:23.100 --> 38:26.500
<i>Knowing there has to be
more to life than this.</i>

38:26.700 --> 38:28.665
<i>Knowing I'm special,</i>

38:28.700 --> 38:31.700
waiting for someone to see it.

38:35.100 --> 38:37.100
I saw it.

38:42.500 --> 38:47.900
<i>You save one life, 100 lives
but it's never enough.</i>

38:49.100 --> 38:52.100
Who'll save me?

38:52.500 --> 38:55.100
I will.

39:01.600 --> 39:03.365
<i>Coming here</i>

39:03.400 --> 39:06.200
gave me meaning again.

39:09.000 --> 39:11.200
You.

39:21.400 --> 39:23.400
You each have a short-term
amnesia pill.

39:23.600 --> 39:25.765
It'll make you forget Adam.

39:25.800 --> 39:29.600
We have to wipe out the last
48 hours from our memories,

39:30.200 --> 39:32.800
go back to who we were.

40:15.000 --> 40:18.200
I'm going to lose so much.

40:18.235 --> 40:20.600
None of it was real.

40:23.000 --> 40:24.700
He loved me...

40:24.735 --> 40:26.365
and I loved him.

40:26.400 --> 40:29.600
It's no different from
real memory.

40:29.800 --> 40:32.600
He forced it on you.

40:34.200 --> 40:37.800
You have to let it go.

41:01.400 --> 41:03.400
Goodbye, Adam.

41:39.000 --> 41:40.965
Just me left.

41:41.000 --> 41:44.600
Jack, I know what it's like
not to exist.

41:44.800 --> 41:46.600
Please don't send me back there.

41:46.635 --> 41:48.365
I have to.

41:48.400 --> 41:51.165
What are you going to do?

41:51.200 --> 41:53.600
This will wipe out
the past two days.

41:53.635 --> 41:56.000
Well, you'll still keep
the bad memories.

41:56.035 --> 41:58.765
Because they were always yours.

41:58.800 --> 42:01.800
But what about
the good times, Jack?

42:02.200 --> 42:05.000
What about the last good
memory of you and your dad?

42:05.035 --> 42:07.800
- It's lost.
- I can help you find it.

42:08.200 --> 42:09.800
I can take you back there.

42:09.835 --> 42:12.000
Before I die.

42:14.800 --> 42:16.165
Why would you do that?

42:16.200 --> 42:18.200
I was in the void for so long,

42:18.600 --> 42:21.965
the colours of this world
almost blinded me, Jack.

42:22.000 --> 42:26.400
It was so beautiful after the darkness
and the stench of fear.

42:26.435 --> 42:28.565
You gave me that.

42:28.600 --> 42:31.600
Let me do this for you.

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
Come on.

42:34.400 --> 42:37.000
You want this.

42:52.800 --> 42:55.400
It's early evening...

42:56.400 --> 42:58.800
<i>just me and dad.</i>

42:59.400 --> 43:01.000
Oh, no, you don't!

43:01.800 --> 43:03.200
You're out!

43:07.000 --> 43:08.200
You know, one day you're not
going to want to play

43:08.400 --> 43:10.600
with your old dad any more.

43:10.635 --> 43:12.200
Never.

43:13.400 --> 43:15.200
Are you there?

43:15.600 --> 43:17.000
Yeah.

43:18.200 --> 43:19.965
<i>Me, dad and...</i>

43:20.000 --> 43:22.600
<i>- Dad! Mom said I could play too...
- Gray.</i>

43:23.200 --> 43:24.400
Hey, Gray!

43:30.000 --> 43:32.400
- All right, son. One more.
- Okay.

43:34.600 --> 43:36.800
Whoa, I'll get it.

43:38.600 --> 43:41.800
I'm running for the ball!

43:48.400 --> 43:49.600
<i>Some other boy is there.</i>

43:49.635 --> 43:50.765
<i>I don't know who.</i>

43:50.800 --> 43:52.165
- Can I play?
- Who are you?

43:52.200 --> 43:55.600
<i>- My name's Adam.
- Let me play.</i>

43:56.600 --> 43:58.500
Before it gets dark.

43:58.535 --> 44:00.400
There's lots of room.

44:01.200 --> 44:04.200
Hey, what are you doing?

44:05.000 --> 44:06.100
Are you all right?

44:06.135 --> 44:07.200
I just want to play.

44:07.235 --> 44:07.965
He can play.

44:08.000 --> 44:10.165
No! He doesn't belong here.

44:10.200 --> 44:11.400
I don't want him
playing with us.

44:11.435 --> 44:12.365
I'm Adam.

44:12.400 --> 44:13.600
Don't touch my dad.

44:13.635 --> 44:15.800
Hey, easy!

44:16.400 --> 44:18.200
Are you all right, Adam?

44:18.800 --> 44:20.565
Yes, he just doesn't want to share.

44:20.600 --> 44:24.000
Right, well, if you're going to
behave that way, we're going home.

44:24.035 --> 44:26.017
- What?!
- Come on, Gray.

44:26.052 --> 44:27.965
No, we don't leave yet.

44:28.000 --> 44:33.400
We play some more, it gets dark,
we light a fire... mum joins us.

44:33.435 --> 44:35.800
Come on, son. I'll race you.

44:35.835 --> 44:37.600
Race you.

44:37.635 --> 44:39.400
Dad!

44:40.600 --> 44:44.400
You did this. You spoilt it.

44:44.435 --> 44:48.317
I made it happen.

44:48.352 --> 44:52.200
Dad! Dad, I love you.

44:52.600 --> 44:56.600
Dad, wait... dad!

44:57.400 --> 45:00.000
I want the real memory back.

45:00.035 --> 45:01.965
Then let me live.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.600
That box you found
contains my last good memory

45:04.800 --> 45:08.000
of you, your dad and Gray.

45:08.400 --> 45:10.800
You see, I'm a part of it now,

45:11.200 --> 45:13.200
and I'll always live
as long as you remember it.

45:13.400 --> 45:15.800
That's why you took me back.

45:15.835 --> 45:17.965
Wasn't it lovely?

45:18.000 --> 45:21.600
Playing in the sand,
no-one knowing what was ahead...

45:21.635 --> 45:23.817
your dad laughing.

45:23.852 --> 45:26.000
Gray, safe and happy.

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
I don't want to die!

45:35.200 --> 45:39.200
You take that pill and you will
lose everything I've given you.

45:39.235 --> 45:43.200
Wipe me out now and you will lose
all your memories of your father.

45:43.235 --> 45:46.400
He will cease to have existed
for you.

45:50.600 --> 45:53.200
Goodbye, Adam.

46:06.000 --> 46:08.600
Dad! Gray!

46:12.600 --> 46:16.800
Come back! It wasn't like this!

46:31.800 --> 46:34.400
Dad! Gray!

47:07.600 --> 47:10.400
Jack, how have we lost two days?

47:10.435 --> 47:11.617
What d'you mean?

47:11.652 --> 47:12.800
The last 48 hours.

47:13.000 --> 47:14.365
None of us
can remember a thing.

47:14.400 --> 47:17.200
The system's blank,
the CCTV's been wiped.

47:17.235 --> 47:19.417
What's been going on?

47:19.452 --> 47:21.600
What've we been doing?

47:23.200 --> 47:24.965
I don't know.

47:25.000 --> 47:28.200
Great! That's two days of my life
that I'll never get back!

47:28.235 --> 47:31.400
Looks like Toshiko got herself
a secret admirer, though.

47:31.435 --> 47:32.565
Oh, yeah?

47:32.600 --> 47:36.600
"To Tosh, love and apologies,
Owen. "

47:36.635 --> 47:38.400
They're from you.

47:39.000 --> 47:40.000
In your dreams, Tosh.

47:40.600 --> 47:42.800
I think someone's
winding you up, darling.

47:42.835 --> 47:45.400
No, I don't do flowers...

47:47.000 --> 47:50.200
and I definitely
don't do apologies.

48:10.000 --> 48:11.600
Did you call?

48:11.635 --> 48:13.165
Found your diary.

48:13.200 --> 48:15.600
Yep, been looking for that.

48:17.600 --> 48:19.965
And for the record...

48:20.000 --> 48:23.600
measuring tapes never lie.

48:24.000 --> 48:25.200
Hey!

48:26.200 --> 48:26.965
Yep?

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
Who's Adam?

48:29.300 --> 48:30.700
Don't know.
