Delicious.

Mm.

38:05.350 --> 38:06.783
Jake, you must be happy
having meat

38:06.785 --> 38:09.319
After all that seafood
on the island.

Yep.

38:34.446 --> 38:35.945
This may not mean much
coming from me, jake.

38:35.947 --> 38:40.717
For taking care of my daughter,
keeping her safe.

38:40.719 --> 38:43.486
It's comforting to know
that she's in good hands.

38:49.493 --> 38:51.428
Uh, more roast?

38:53.831 --> 38:55.031
Why'd you do it?

Hmm?

38:56.335 --> 38:58.435
Kill harrison.

38:58.437 --> 38:59.736
Did he figure out

38:59.738 --> 39:02.072
That you murdered
the president's kid?

39:02.074 --> 39:05.909
You delivered the culprit's head
on a silver platter,

39:05.911 --> 39:07.110
And fitz didn't have
a clue.

39:07.112 --> 39:08.378
Now you're back,
ruling the underworld

39:08.380 --> 39:09.379
With the president
in your pocket.

39:09.381 --> 39:10.580
Nicely done.
That's enough.

39:10.582 --> 39:12.882
You're in my home.
Shut up.

39:12.884 --> 39:15.585
Just shut your stubborn,
old-man mouth up.

39:15.587 --> 39:16.853
You're done giving orders.

39:16.855 --> 39:18.388
You're leaving.

39:18.390 --> 39:19.889
You're done in washington
for good.

39:19.891 --> 39:22.058
You're no longer
the head of b613.

39:22.060 --> 39:23.693
I'll give you
however long it takes

39:23.695 --> 39:24.794
To pack up this sad,
old house.

39:24.796 --> 39:26.930
And then you disappear
quietly.

39:26.932 --> 39:28.398
You never
contact olivia again.

39:28.400 --> 39:29.966
You never get another chance
to hurt her.

39:29.968 --> 39:31.901
Or you can stay,

39:31.903 --> 39:33.937
Keep up this
"father knows best" routine,

39:33.939 --> 39:37.607
Try to worm your way back
into her life by roasting pork.

39:37.609 --> 39:40.810
I personally can't see her
falling for your act anymore

39:40.812 --> 39:42.879
After I show her proof
that you killed

39:42.881 --> 39:44.514
Her best friend
and the president's son.

39:48.152 --> 39:50.920
But listen --
I know of this island.

39:50.922 --> 39:53.423
It's beautiful.
Remote.

39:53.425 --> 39:55.892
Mosquitoes can be
a bit of a nuisance,

39:55.894 --> 40:00.530
The only unfortunate thing
about your sudden departure

40:00.532 --> 40:03.433
Is that I won't be standing
over you when you die.

40:03.435 --> 40:05.935
Make you feel good, ballard,
putting the screws to me?

40:05.937 --> 40:08.037
Feeling a few inches
taller now, hmm?

40:08.039 --> 40:09.873
Makes you feel like
a real man.

40:09.875 --> 40:12.142
It's exhilarating, isn't it?

40:12.144 --> 40:14.677
Go ahead. Soak it up.
Revel in it.

40:14.679 --> 40:15.979
Because trust me --

40:15.981 --> 40:20.016
I will be the one
standing over you when you die.

It's my client.

40:29.594 --> 40:31.661
I have to go.
I hate to cut this short.

40:31.663 --> 40:32.595
Oh.

40:32.597 --> 40:33.830
That's too bad.

40:33.832 --> 40:36.433
I was enjoying finally
getting to know your dad.

Well, we'll, uh...
We'll do this again soon, hmm?

You told me
to trace caitlin's movements

40:49.748 --> 40:51.481
Before she went to the hotel,
so I did.

40:51.483 --> 40:52.615
Where is this?

40:52.617 --> 40:54.017
Winslow, hertz and granger.

40:54.019 --> 40:55.585
Her father's law firm.

40:55.587 --> 40:59.088

struggling over?
Looks like a folder.

41:02.561 --> 41:05.728
I tried facial recognition,
but there's nothing.

41:05.730 --> 41:06.963
We could be looking
at caitlin's murderer.

41:06.965 --> 41:08.198
And we need to find
that folder.

It only feels awkward
because it's your first time.

41:33.859 --> 41:35.992
I promise.

Next time,
you'll be a pro.

there will be a next time.
