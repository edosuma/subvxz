00:01.669 --> 00:03.504
[Mac] The president has had a stroke.

00:03.570 --> 00:07.208
The 25th Amendment kicks in. The
vice president assumes the presidency.

00:07.274 --> 00:08.843
What happens? Do I take the oath?

00:08.909 --> 00:11.078
Madam Vice President,
we need you to resign.

00:11.145 --> 00:15.683
You know that your vice-presidency was
never ever intended to be a presidency.

00:15.749 --> 00:17.151
It was done as a stunt.

00:17.218 --> 00:20.187
I think people voted for what
President Bridges believes in.

00:20.254 --> 00:23.190
If you can't deliver,
then maybe you should step aside.

00:23.257 --> 00:25.526
This is what we do.
We do the right thing.

00:25.593 --> 00:27.962
You want to be president
because you want power.

00:28.028 --> 00:30.164
- That's not me.
- Well, that's the problem.

00:30.231 --> 00:33.234
I'm gonna go out there
and I'm gonna take the oath of office.

00:33.300 --> 00:35.903
- The president of the United States.
- [clapping]

00:40.641 --> 00:42.042
I run the first lady's staff.

00:42.109 --> 00:45.346
- May I show you to your office?
- It's, uh, very, uh... pink.

00:45.412 --> 00:47.214
I want you to be my chief of staff.

00:47.281 --> 00:50.317
We can save this country.
We can save it from her.

00:50.384 --> 00:54.121
If you think that I am gonna step aside,
you are sorely mistaken.

01:02.863 --> 01:07.601
[Nathan] In his two years as president,
Teddy Bridges demonstrated to us

01:07.668 --> 01:13.174
that who we have been as a nation
is not as important as who we can be.

01:13.240 --> 01:16.177
That was his gift to us. His vision.

01:16.243 --> 01:20.614
When it came time for him to pick
his vice president, he chose a woman.

01:20.681 --> 01:25.219
A political independent.
Teddy Bridges had that genius.

01:25.286 --> 01:30.057
The genius to see past the constraints
of the present to the future

01:30.124 --> 01:33.027
and recognize in it
an idea whose time has come,

01:33.093 --> 01:35.729
and make that idea a reality.

01:37.031 --> 01:38.632
Our reality.

01:38.699 --> 01:41.135
- [man] Aim. Fire!
- [gunshots]

01:43.537 --> 01:47.508
Pray for the soul
of our beloved president.

01:47.575 --> 01:49.944
Pray for the soul of our new president.

01:50.010 --> 01:54.148
Pray for Mackenzie Allen.
Her husband. Her children.

01:54.949 --> 01:58.085
Pray for this nation that waits
with hopeful heart for her

01:58.152 --> 02:01.422
to answer the clarion call
of Teddy Bridges.

02:02.423 --> 02:04.658
For it is only through your deeds

02:05.326 --> 02:08.829
that his genius
can be fulfilled for us all.

02:08.895 --> 02:10.965
- [man] Aim. Fire!
- [gunshots]

02:11.065 --> 02:12.266
[whinnying]

02:12.333 --> 02:17.271
"It's only through your deeds that
his genius can be fulfilled for us all."

02:17.338 --> 02:21.041
Templeton doesn't want you to be able
to take credit for your own presidency.

02:21.108 --> 02:22.376
With him next in line,

02:22.443 --> 02:25.579
it is top priority for us
to get a vice president confirmed.

02:25.646 --> 02:29.750
- I think it should be Warren Keaton.
- That guy hates you. Why help him?

02:29.817 --> 02:31.919
I don't wanna help him.
I want him to help me.

02:31.986 --> 02:34.388
- And the country.
- You should listen to your son.

02:34.455 --> 02:36.257
Keaton was attacking you for a year.

02:36.323 --> 02:38.158
Why do you need a vice president?

02:38.225 --> 02:42.396
Mommy needs somebody who can
take over in case I can't do the job.

02:42.463 --> 02:44.598
It's kind of like a...
substitute teacher.

02:44.665 --> 02:47.801
Right. And we've got
to find the best one possible.

02:47.868 --> 02:50.337
But you have to keep it a big secret.

02:50.404 --> 02:54.675
So, from now on, anything that
we say stays within this family.

02:54.742 --> 02:56.477
- OK.
- OK.

03:00.214 --> 03:01.782
- Hey.
- Hiya, Nate.

03:03.717 --> 03:06.720
- So it ends, huh?
- So it begins.

03:06.787 --> 03:09.189
- She give you a list?
- Yes.

03:09.256 --> 03:10.324
- Long?
- One name.

03:10.391 --> 03:11.625
Whose?

03:11.692 --> 03:14.361
C'mon, Mr. Speaker, you know I can't...

03:14.428 --> 03:16.263
Is the name on that list?

03:17.264 --> 03:20.901
Those are the nominees that I can
guarantee I can get through Congress.

03:20.968 --> 03:23.470
Tucker Baynes's name
is right at the top of the list.

03:23.537 --> 03:25.539
Governor Baynes
is at the top of the list.

03:25.606 --> 03:29.543
- That's not a problem for you, is it?
- No. I like Tucker Baynes.

03:31.045 --> 03:32.913
You tell the girl

03:32.980 --> 03:35.783
that this is just a dance.

03:35.849 --> 03:39.953
She steps on people's toes,
she sits it out.

03:40.020 --> 03:41.722
That's how it goes.

03:44.625 --> 03:46.627
[sirens wail]

03:59.506 --> 04:02.276
- Thank you.
- [cameras clicking]

04:04.878 --> 04:09.116
Madam President?
NSC's waiting to meet you.

04:09.183 --> 04:12.353
Mom, how long are we gonna be here?
We have a lot of packing to do.

04:12.419 --> 04:13.487
Hey, slow down, OK?

04:13.554 --> 04:16.557
Madam President.
I'm Chief Usher Waverly.

04:16.623 --> 04:18.291
- How do you do?
- Pleasure.

04:18.358 --> 04:20.761
Like me to show
the first family to the residence?

04:20.827 --> 04:22.529
- Yes.
- Ma'am. Ma'am, we need to go.

04:22.596 --> 04:24.398
OK. I'll catch up with you guys later.

04:24.465 --> 04:27.034
Can we talk about Keaton later?
I have some thoughts.

04:27.101 --> 04:28.602
Of course. All right. Bye.

04:28.669 --> 04:31.438
- Holding up?
- You're asking me?

04:31.505 --> 04:34.808
[man] Secretary of state's
scheduled calls in protocol order.

04:34.875 --> 04:36.977
- We have France, Britain...
- [clamoring]

04:37.044 --> 04:40.147
- [man] Charlie.
- Do we know the president's last words?

04:40.214 --> 04:41.915
They were said to his wife, Grace.

04:41.982 --> 04:45.352
If she wishes to make anything public,
a statement will be published.

04:45.419 --> 04:46.854
[clamoring]

04:46.920 --> 04:49.089
- Sammy.
- Hale, five days ago the president

04:49.156 --> 04:53.827
sent U.S. Marines into Nigeria to rescue
a woman being held by sharia law.

04:53.894 --> 04:57.364
Can you tell us how she came to this
decision and with whom she consulted?

04:57.431 --> 04:59.900
The War Powers Act
required her to notify Congress.

04:59.967 --> 05:01.869
- That mean...?
- [Hale] Let's move on.

05:01.935 --> 05:03.103
- [clamoring]
- Tom.

05:04.705 --> 05:08.776
This, of course, is the famous East Room
where many formal functions are held.

05:08.842 --> 05:11.578
President Kennedy has said
that he loved this room.

05:11.645 --> 05:14.948
- He spent a lot of time here.
- Hello, Mr. Calloway. Hello, children.

05:15.015 --> 05:16.083
I'm Nora Woodruff.

05:16.150 --> 05:17.251
- Hi.
- Hi there.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.119
I'm the White House social director.

05:19.186 --> 05:23.524
I'm also your father's right hand
in the first gentleman's office.

05:23.590 --> 05:26.827
If you'll follow me, I'll be happy
to show you to the residence.

05:26.894 --> 05:28.862
[Waverly] There are four housekeepers,

05:28.929 --> 05:31.965
three valets, six butlers
and several chefs,

05:32.032 --> 05:34.568
all of whom would be happy
to make you anything,

05:34.635 --> 05:37.471
- 24 hours a day.
- Even ice cream sundaes at midnight?

05:37.538 --> 05:39.940
As many as you want.
Right this way.

05:40.707 --> 05:42.910
Let me get some answers
on this Nigeria thing.

05:42.976 --> 05:44.711
- We're flying in the dark.
- Hale.

05:44.778 --> 05:47.381
You invoked the War Powers Act?
What were you thinking?

05:47.448 --> 05:49.016
You trying to inflame the press?

05:49.082 --> 05:52.986
Jim, the cool factor of her being
a woman is gonna wear off real fast

05:53.053 --> 05:55.055
and we're all gonna
go down with the ship.

05:55.122 --> 05:58.325
Hale, I need to know
if the president has your loyalty.

05:58.392 --> 06:00.461
The president's dead, Jim.

06:01.395 --> 06:03.564
I want your resignation
on my desk in an hour.

06:03.630 --> 06:05.499
It's already there.

06:07.801 --> 06:09.336
This is the formal dining room.

06:09.403 --> 06:12.105
There's also an informal dining room
near the kitchen.

06:12.172 --> 06:15.542
- [dog barking]
- Regal! You're here!

06:15.609 --> 06:18.111
- Yes, she is.
- Regal.

06:18.178 --> 06:20.781
OK, um, Rebecca,
your room is here on the left.

06:20.848 --> 06:23.617
Previously occupied
by Susan Ford, Chelsea Clinton...

06:23.684 --> 06:26.119
Where are the tunnels JFK
used to sneak in Marilyn?

06:26.186 --> 06:29.656
- Is that Grace Bridges?
- Yes, as a matter of fact.

06:29.723 --> 06:33.427
The former first lady and Tommy moved
into the guest bedrooms temporarily.

06:34.461 --> 06:37.364
Eleanor Roosevelt stayed
for three months after FDR died.

06:37.431 --> 06:38.699
Hmm.

06:38.765 --> 06:39.900
- We're talking...
- Hi.

06:39.967 --> 06:43.136
Then Smith from NEC needs
to talk about reopening the markets.

06:43.203 --> 06:44.204
- Right.
- OK.

06:44.271 --> 06:47.074
There's a series of bills
nearing their ten-day do or die...

06:47.140 --> 06:48.141
[man] Ten-hut!

06:48.208 --> 06:51.745
...expiration date, including HR-1167,
which the Democratic... Ma'am?

06:53.146 --> 06:56.717
- I can't go in there.
- I'll see you on the other end.

06:57.918 --> 06:59.920
[Mac] Sit. Sit everyone. Thank you.

07:03.757 --> 07:05.592
[TV on low volume]

07:05.659 --> 07:07.027
- [Nathan] Hey.
- Boss.

07:07.895 --> 07:08.896
I loved it.

07:08.962 --> 07:10.898
- The funeral?
- The speech.

07:10.964 --> 07:13.100
Oh. Thank you.

07:13.166 --> 07:15.269
Jim says she's picked somebody already.

07:15.335 --> 07:19.273
No consultation. Just picked somebody.
Who, I don't know.

07:19.339 --> 07:20.340
It's Warren Keaton.

07:22.509 --> 07:26.580
Bloody hell. She is something.
How'd...? When did you find that out?

07:26.647 --> 07:28.682
Sometime after
the second bottle of wine.

07:28.749 --> 07:32.753
OK, well, this is not gonna work.
Everything has to be moved up.

07:33.620 --> 07:36.890
Fly Baynes into town
and go deep background with the press.

07:36.957 --> 07:39.593
"Tucker Baynes is the man.
Baynes has been selected."

07:39.660 --> 07:41.562
That's all I wanna be hearing tonight.

07:41.628 --> 07:44.398
- Baynes is the choice.
- Mackenzie Allen.

07:44.464 --> 07:47.401
What a piece of work
she turned out to be.

07:59.212 --> 08:00.547
[door opening]

08:00.614 --> 08:02.683
- [indistinct chatter]
- [man] Excuse me.

08:02.749 --> 08:06.153
- The meeting with the Joint Chiefs...
- You're one stealth guy, Vince.

08:06.219 --> 08:07.854
Sorry. It's scheduled for 3:00.

08:07.921 --> 08:10.557
Communications staff
thinks a photo op's important.

08:10.624 --> 08:13.126
It was my call, actually.
The world needs to see you

08:13.193 --> 08:14.661
- as commander in chief.
- OK.

08:14.728 --> 08:16.630
[Jim] Give me a minute with the boss.

08:16.697 --> 08:18.031
- We'll finish later.
- OK.

08:18.098 --> 08:19.700
What were you saying?

08:19.766 --> 08:22.235
I had to encourage
your press secretary to resign.

08:22.302 --> 08:23.303
You did?

08:23.370 --> 08:27.140
He informed the press it was his belief
you had to invoke the War Powers Act

08:27.207 --> 08:29.910
before going and gathering
Oria Madula out of Nigeria.

08:29.977 --> 08:32.913
Wants the media questioning
my abilities from the start.

08:32.980 --> 08:35.082
Who do we have
walking the story back for us?

08:35.148 --> 08:38.619
Should be Alex Williams, Hale's deputy.
I suggest you elevate him.

08:38.684 --> 08:40.087
He's quick, has experience.

08:40.153 --> 08:42.589
- Knows what he's doing...
- Not so sure about that.

08:42.655 --> 08:44.391
This could be an opportunity for us.

08:44.458 --> 08:48.562
And, Jim, next time you want
to fire somebody at that level,

08:48.629 --> 08:51.465
- check with me first.
- Yes, ma'am.

08:52.265 --> 08:53.700
OK, what else?

08:53.767 --> 08:57.671
Templeton approached with a list
of confirmable Republican VPs.

08:57.738 --> 08:59.272
He put Tucker Baynes at the top.

08:59.339 --> 09:01.375
You tell him I wanna go
with Warren Keaton?

09:01.441 --> 09:04.911
- â€˜Course not, ma'am.
- Baynes is interesting, but...

09:04.978 --> 09:07.014
When are you gonna talk with Keaton?

09:07.080 --> 09:09.016
A conference call with him in an hour.

09:09.082 --> 09:11.652
- What do I have now?
- Democratic leadership, ma'am.

09:11.718 --> 09:15.155
This thing where I've no idea what
I'm doing from one moment to the next,

09:15.222 --> 09:18.592
- I should just get used to that, right?
- You bet, ma'am.

09:18.659 --> 09:21.528
All right. Hello, everyone.

09:21.595 --> 09:25.032
- Rebecca, this is your room.
- Wait. We've already been moved?

09:25.098 --> 09:28.068
During the funeral.
Usually happens during inaugurations.

09:28.135 --> 09:31.171
I believe the record was when
Reagan left and Bush One moved in.

09:31.238 --> 09:33.840
That was three hours,
all on one very cold, wet day.

09:33.907 --> 09:36.643
Whoa! This is the exact same
as your room in the old house.

09:36.710 --> 09:39.780
- That's the point.
- Everything's in the same spot. This...

09:39.846 --> 09:41.815
- The posters.
- It's great, isn't it?

09:41.882 --> 09:44.918
- They even organized her underwear.
- Yes, that'd be Gregory,

09:44.985 --> 09:47.654
- the children's valet.
- Gregory? Oh, God.

09:47.721 --> 09:50.424
- C'mon, Becca.
- He's very professional, I assure you.

09:50.524 --> 09:52.793
It's no big deal.
A little creepy, maybe.

09:52.926 --> 09:56.196
- Is there something wrong?
- Uh, you know, it's-it's fine.

09:56.263 --> 09:59.933
Well, good.
Then Amy, let's go look at your room.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.334
[Waverly] Right this way.

10:05.472 --> 10:08.008
Speaking as a woman,
I want to tell you how proud I am.

10:08.075 --> 10:09.309
Thank you, senator.

10:09.376 --> 10:12.779
I assume there'll be opportunities
to discuss legislative agenda.

10:12.846 --> 10:15.382
I couldn't govern
without your help, Alison.

10:15.449 --> 10:19.152
If you have questions about our
priority legislation, like HR-1167...

10:19.219 --> 10:21.722
We'd like to give you
a list of potential VP nominees.

10:21.788 --> 10:23.924
- Who's at the top?
- John Vernon.

10:23.990 --> 10:27.561
If you recommend a Democrat
to join a Republican administration,

10:27.627 --> 10:29.463
must it be a card-carrying communist?

10:29.529 --> 10:34.401
I like John Vernon. It's just,
his agenda's very... John Vernon.

10:34.468 --> 10:36.236
Well, you should at least meet.

10:36.303 --> 10:40.140
I've decided to go with the old
"best person for the job" thing.

10:40.207 --> 10:43.510
- You're trying to position...
- May I ask who you're considering?

10:43.577 --> 10:45.712
I'd like to keep that
to the team for now.

10:45.779 --> 10:49.216
I don't mean to take advantage
of the death of a president.

10:49.307 --> 10:51.977
But this is an opportunity
for the party.

10:52.018 --> 10:54.821
Well, one of the benefits
of being Independent

10:54.888 --> 10:57.491
is I don't have
to worry about such things.

11:01.461 --> 11:03.597
Well, there's one thing you're right on.

11:03.663 --> 11:06.833
You can't govern without us.

11:06.875 --> 11:10.612
We moved the OMB call which affected
the scheduling meeting now set for 8:30.

11:10.704 --> 11:14.174
Make sure I have time to get to the
residence to see my family before that.

11:14.241 --> 11:17.744
We may need to clear a couple of hours
at some point to see General Keaton.

11:17.811 --> 11:19.679
I will take care of that, ma'am.

11:19.746 --> 11:21.281
- Jim.
- Mr. Gardner.

11:22.549 --> 11:26.853
So after that meeting, I have
the Democrats with a target on my back.

11:26.920 --> 11:29.589
You have an 80 percent
approval rating with the people.

11:29.656 --> 11:32.092
Too bad they don't run
the confirmation hearings.

11:32.159 --> 11:34.127
May be moot as far
as Keaton's concerned.

11:34.194 --> 11:36.963
He'll take a call, but he
doesn't think it's good to meet.

11:37.030 --> 11:40.233
- In other words, he's not interested.
- That has yet to be seen.

11:40.300 --> 11:42.102
- Ma'am.
- Don't wanna hear arguments

11:42.169 --> 11:44.771
- against Keaton. I've heard 'em.
- All due respect...

11:44.838 --> 11:46.907
I know how much
he's attacked me in the past.

11:46.973 --> 11:49.476
My husband would rather
punch him than shake his hand.

11:49.543 --> 11:51.011
This is a special man.

11:51.077 --> 11:53.914
He won a war without
losing a single American life.

11:53.980 --> 11:56.383
On top of that,
he's an economics genius.

11:56.449 --> 11:59.352
Name me one candidate
on either list who could match that.

12:00.220 --> 12:02.823
This is a man
the American people respect.

12:02.889 --> 12:04.357
This is a man I respect.

12:04.424 --> 12:07.093
A man who doesn't have
any idea how Washington works.

12:07.160 --> 12:09.162
Isn't that what we have you for?

12:09.229 --> 12:10.363
Set up the call.

12:10.430 --> 12:13.466
- Keaton's gonna do it.
- Will do.

12:14.634 --> 12:19.172
- Daddy, whose furniture is this?
- It's ours, honey. You like it?

12:19.239 --> 12:21.975
It doesn't look like the kind
you're supposed to sit on.

12:22.042 --> 12:23.877
Of course it is. Go ahead.

12:27.547 --> 12:31.084
- I miss our couch.
- Yeah, so do I.

12:31.151 --> 12:32.986
Is there a TV, at least?

12:33.053 --> 12:34.621
- Um, hey, Dad?
- Hey.

12:34.688 --> 12:37.224
Um, what if something's
missing from my room.

12:37.290 --> 12:39.359
- Like what?
- Um, CDs or whatever.

12:39.426 --> 12:41.595
I'm pretty sure
they cleared out the place.

12:41.661 --> 12:43.697
So we're never going back?

12:44.798 --> 12:46.700
No, honey, we live here now.

12:46.766 --> 12:49.970
- [Rod] Listen, Becca...
- Something could've been dropped.

12:50.036 --> 12:53.440
- We'll replace your CDs, I promise.
- No, Dad, it's not that...

12:53.506 --> 12:56.109
Becca, I'll call somebody.
What's missing exactly?

12:56.176 --> 12:58.545
Oh, no, Dad.
You don't have to do that.

12:58.612 --> 13:01.414
Um, don't call anyone.
It's not a big deal.

13:01.481 --> 13:03.149
Never mind.

13:06.186 --> 13:09.155
[Mac] The Russian-American
relationship's too important.

13:09.222 --> 13:12.158
I've every intention
of keeping the summit on schedule.

13:13.293 --> 13:15.562
I look forward to meeting
you and your husband.

13:17.831 --> 13:20.000
Please send my condolences
to Mrs. Bridges.

13:20.066 --> 13:22.669
Yes, I will pass
your thoughts along to Grace.

13:22.736 --> 13:26.239
- Thank you, President Kharkov.
- [speaking Russian]

13:27.073 --> 13:28.074
- Ma'am.
- Thank you.

13:28.141 --> 13:30.377
- Thank you, Madam President.
- [Mac] Kelly.

13:30.443 --> 13:31.778
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes.

13:31.845 --> 13:34.714
I hope someday I'm gonna
get back to our once a week lunches.

13:34.781 --> 13:36.683
- Are you hungry?
- No. Thank you.

13:36.750 --> 13:38.785
So, you heard
about our press secretary?

13:38.852 --> 13:41.788
- This thing with the War Powers Act?
- It's very surprising.

13:41.855 --> 13:44.190
What do you think
of the deputy press secretary?

13:44.257 --> 13:46.860
Alex Williams. I think he's...
good. He's efficient.

13:46.927 --> 13:49.963
I know the press likes him.
Why? You thinking of promoting him?

13:50.030 --> 13:54.034
No. I was going to suggest
that you keep him on.

13:55.201 --> 13:57.470
- I'm making you press secretary.
- Me?

13:57.537 --> 13:59.105
- Yes.
- Press secretary?

13:59.172 --> 14:01.474
Madam President, I'm a speechwriter.

14:01.541 --> 14:03.777
Three years ago
I was a university chancellor.

14:03.843 --> 14:05.178
This is our shot.

14:05.245 --> 14:07.981
And that is the most
powerful microphone in the world.

14:08.048 --> 14:09.749
I want one of my people behind it.

14:11.718 --> 14:14.521
- When would I start?
- Your briefing book.

14:14.587 --> 14:16.690
- The bible.
- Thanks, Alex.

14:16.756 --> 14:18.525
I really appreciate this. I just...

14:18.591 --> 14:20.660
I want you to know
I didn't ask for this job.

14:20.727 --> 14:22.929
- No worries. I get it.
- No, it's just that I...

14:22.996 --> 14:25.966
Just stick to the talking points.
And the seating chart.

14:26.032 --> 14:28.501
- And Hale always called on Gilda first.
- Got it.

14:28.568 --> 14:31.404
OK. The cable stations
are cutting in to take you live.

14:31.471 --> 14:34.341
- Your first briefing and all.
- [reporters murmuring]

14:34.407 --> 14:36.409
[cameras clicking]

14:39.279 --> 14:40.780
[Kelly clears throat]

14:44.117 --> 14:47.954
Let me begin with a few housekeeping
items and scheduling changes.

14:48.021 --> 14:51.491
The president's meeting with
the Joint Chiefs will now take place

14:51.558 --> 14:55.495
at 3:30 in the Roosevelt Room.
There will be a photo op.

14:55.562 --> 14:57.030
Expanded pool only.

14:57.097 --> 14:59.399
President Allen
will have a phone meeting

14:59.466 --> 15:02.268
with this month's head
of the Security Council.

15:02.335 --> 15:05.005
And with that,
I just want to say that I am

15:05.071 --> 15:07.507
very proud to take over
as press secretary.

15:07.574 --> 15:09.943
Um... OK, I'd like
to open it up to some...

15:10.010 --> 15:12.379
- [all] Kelly!
- Kelly.

15:12.445 --> 15:15.448
- OK, Charlie, first question.
- Yeah, has President...?

15:15.515 --> 15:18.118
What's the update on nominating
a new vice president?

15:18.184 --> 15:21.054
Well, Gilda, President Allen
is moving forward

15:21.121 --> 15:23.757
with the deliberate speed
of such a weighty decision.

15:23.823 --> 15:24.958
[clamoring]

15:25.025 --> 15:27.227
Kelly, are there any names
on the short list?

15:27.293 --> 15:29.195
I haven't discussed that with her.

15:29.262 --> 15:32.665
Maybe you can suss her out. Make
our lives a little more interesting.

15:32.732 --> 15:35.702
Did the president follow
the protocol of the War Powers Act,

15:35.769 --> 15:37.337
as Hale mentioned this morning,

15:37.404 --> 15:40.473
when she had Oria Madula
handed over to United States Marines?

15:41.374 --> 15:45.378
- I wasn't in the loop on that.
- [clamoring]

15:45.445 --> 15:46.913
Designers. Any preferences?

15:46.980 --> 15:49.082
[clearing throat]
Not sure now's the time.

15:49.149 --> 15:51.985
- It's kind of inappropriate.
- They're gonna be after you.

15:52.052 --> 15:56.056
You're the first first gentleman.
You'll be affecting styles for years.

15:56.122 --> 15:58.691
- Well, I, uh, like Zegna.
- Oh. No.

15:59.059 --> 16:00.760
- No?
- Remember what happened

16:00.827 --> 16:03.430
- when Clinton wore Armani?
- I don't really remember.

16:03.496 --> 16:05.298
American designers only, thank you.

16:05.365 --> 16:07.767
- [knock on door]
- Hey!

16:08.768 --> 16:09.769
Yes?

16:09.836 --> 16:12.405
- Hey, Steve, how the hell are you?
- Good.

16:12.472 --> 16:14.808
Listen, I was over at the OEOB
and I thought...

16:14.874 --> 16:17.343
- You have curators at 4:40.
- Great.

16:19.512 --> 16:21.981
- New assistant, huh?
- Yeah, something like that.

16:22.048 --> 16:25.652
- So...
- So. Uh... What... Oh, God.

16:25.718 --> 16:27.821
- Hell of a thing, huh?
- Yeah.

16:27.887 --> 16:31.357
I was wondering if I could talk to you
about the governor of New Mexico.

16:31.424 --> 16:33.259
I know Luis. I like him a lot.

16:33.326 --> 16:36.196
You should see the testing
on this guy for vice president.

16:36.262 --> 16:38.164
- I mean, it's seismic.
- Oh.

16:38.231 --> 16:39.666
Here are the results.

16:39.732 --> 16:41.801
I mean, he edges her across the aisle.

16:41.868 --> 16:45.505
Well, uh, it's a good name.
It's bold. I'll run it up the flag pole.

16:46.206 --> 16:48.208
You're still in the thick of it, right?

16:48.274 --> 16:50.610
Yeah. I'm gonna get
right into it. Don't worry.

16:52.312 --> 16:54.747
Mess is closed, huh?

16:54.814 --> 16:56.583
I like it down here. It's quiet.

16:56.649 --> 16:58.485
Famous navy bean soup.

16:58.551 --> 16:59.819
Oh.

17:00.420 --> 17:02.288
I just spoke with a buddy of mine

17:02.355 --> 17:05.391
who works for a political action
committee in the Southwest.

17:05.458 --> 17:07.460
Are you here to talk about Luis Alfano?

17:07.527 --> 17:08.895
I am. Yes.

17:08.962 --> 17:10.864
We did opp research on him years ago.

17:10.930 --> 17:12.866
- He was in muddy waters.
- I know that.

17:12.932 --> 17:15.367
- It just got me thinking...
- Can I stop you?

17:17.369 --> 17:20.073
You need to sit back
and just take a deep breath, Rod.

17:20.707 --> 17:23.143
Now you are,
you know, the first spouse.

17:23.209 --> 17:26.846
People are gonna try to take
advantage of you, influence you...

17:26.913 --> 17:30.517
They don't see me as a spouse.
They see me as an advisor.

17:30.583 --> 17:32.352
And that's even worse.

17:33.553 --> 17:35.555
Do yourself a favor, Rod.

17:36.422 --> 17:38.091
Stay in your lane.

17:38.658 --> 17:40.593
Look, if Iâ€˜ve got an idea...

17:40.660 --> 17:43.329
Well, you're the one
who has her ear at bedside, so...

17:46.633 --> 17:51.337
Green's foreign policy, orange's
domestic. Purple is for just political.

17:51.404 --> 17:54.340
The next seven days, I want
to keep that board 75 percent green.

17:54.407 --> 17:56.843
Let's keep political meetings
to a minimum.

17:56.910 --> 17:59.812
Go and put time on the
schedule for legislative meetings.

17:59.879 --> 18:02.916
- Yes, sir. OK, beginning Monday...
- Eleanor, I'm sorry.

18:02.982 --> 18:04.918
Could we take a short break, please?

18:04.984 --> 18:06.586
[Eleanor] Yes, ma'am.

18:08.788 --> 18:11.558
- Yeah. Oh, gotta go.
- Laura.

18:11.624 --> 18:14.160
- I'm gonna go upstairs for a minute.
- Yes, ma'am.

18:14.227 --> 18:17.130
- Here. I'll take that, thank you.
- Ma'am, is everything OK?

18:17.197 --> 18:20.300
Yeah. Fine. We just may
need another color for the chart.

18:20.366 --> 18:22.468
We always have
dinner together as a family

18:22.535 --> 18:24.971
and, obviously,
since it's 11, I've missed it.

18:25.038 --> 18:26.839
- Understood.
- Ma'am, I'm so sorry.

18:26.906 --> 18:29.576
- I don't know how this happened.
- ...Oval Office, where

18:29.642 --> 18:32.745
- a decision's been made...
- No confirmation. They ran with it.

18:32.812 --> 18:36.416
According to high-level source
close to the vice-presidential search,

18:36.482 --> 18:39.052
President Allen
has selected Tucker Baynes,

18:39.118 --> 18:42.222
the former Republican governor
from Oklahoma, as her choice.

18:42.288 --> 18:45.024
- Now this is unexpected...
- This on the other networks?

18:45.091 --> 18:47.093
- All of them.
- [reporter continues]

18:48.261 --> 18:51.431
- Templeton's handiwork?
- [Jim] He's connecting Baynes to you.

18:51.497 --> 18:53.800
The press'll poll. Baynes'll test great.

18:53.866 --> 18:55.568
I'll be praised for my choice.

18:55.635 --> 18:59.806
They'll say how egoless it is of me
to choose someone so charismatic.

18:59.872 --> 19:02.976
And If I don't go with him,
they'll say I'm weak and indecisive.

19:03.042 --> 19:05.745
- [phone ringing]
- Exactly. Templeton's boxing us in.

19:05.812 --> 19:08.047
Templeton is not choosing
my vice president.

19:08.114 --> 19:13.119
- [Laura] Mr. Gardner? For you.
- Ma'am, I'm... I'm sorry.

19:13.186 --> 19:15.355
- Kelly, it's not you.
- [Jim] You sure?

19:16.489 --> 19:19.392
Guess General Keaton
didn't want to be in second position.

19:19.459 --> 19:22.028
That was his office.
They just canceled our call.

19:23.463 --> 19:25.465
That didn't take long.

19:30.303 --> 19:32.472
That's different
from what you said before.

19:32.538 --> 19:34.607
Just tell me what the general told you.

19:36.142 --> 19:38.544
All right. Thanks, Norman.

19:39.712 --> 19:42.282
[Jim] The general's aide
says we should move on.

19:43.816 --> 19:46.219
You gotta respect the guy's arrogance.

19:46.286 --> 19:49.722
[Jim] We should start considering
other nominees, including Baynes,

19:49.789 --> 19:53.159
- on our terms...
- No, not yet. Let Keaton cool off.

19:53.926 --> 19:56.362
"Move on" is not the same as "no."

19:57.730 --> 20:00.099
Staff's still here
for the scheduling meeting.

20:00.166 --> 20:03.703
- You want me to push it till tomorrow?
- No. Let's... Let's get it done.

20:03.770 --> 20:06.172
OK. I just need to say
good night to my family.

20:06.239 --> 20:07.974
OK, ma'am. I'll see you in there.

20:21.487 --> 20:24.657
[sighs, chuckles]

20:39.639 --> 20:42.375
- [whispering] Hey, how you doing?
- [whispering] Hey.

20:42.442 --> 20:45.111
- How's the room?
- Same as back home.

20:45.178 --> 20:47.380
- Really?
- Yeah. Like... exactly.

20:48.314 --> 20:51.684
This whole thing about being here's
kinda... kinda weird, you know?

20:51.751 --> 20:55.021
I know. It is. I'm gonna
go say good night to Becca.

20:55.088 --> 20:57.690
Oh, Mom, I think she's
totally crashed for the night.

20:57.757 --> 21:00.460
- Yeah? All right. Good night, baby.
- Good night.

21:01.227 --> 21:02.695
Sleep good.

21:03.629 --> 21:04.731
I don't know where I am.

21:04.797 --> 21:08.201
Could you just pick me up somewhere,
like at 15th or something.

21:08.267 --> 21:09.736
- Hello?
- Rebecca?

21:09.802 --> 21:12.305
- It keeps cutting out.
- That's a security measure.

21:12.372 --> 21:13.373
What're you doing?

21:13.439 --> 21:15.641
Look, can I just get
a cab or a car or something?

21:15.708 --> 21:17.577
I mean, how the hell
do I get out of here?

21:17.643 --> 21:22.482
- Look, you need to calm down.
- Look, they left it there, all right?

21:22.548 --> 21:25.051
I gotta go back and get it
before somebody else does.

21:25.118 --> 21:28.321
Left what? What are you talking about?

21:28.388 --> 21:30.757
[sighing] My diary.

21:32.959 --> 21:35.328
And it's got stuff in it.

21:37.130 --> 21:38.798
What kind of stuff?

21:42.101 --> 21:44.103
Stuff about Mom.

21:48.641 --> 21:49.976
She appears.

21:50.843 --> 21:52.111
- Hey.
- [Rod] You eat?

21:52.178 --> 21:54.380
I hear the room service
around here's not bad.

21:54.447 --> 21:56.716
No, I just came up
to say good night to the kids.

21:56.783 --> 21:59.085
First day in and I missed dinner.

21:59.152 --> 22:01.487
Well, I've been with 'em and they're OK.

22:01.554 --> 22:03.790
They've figured out being president's

22:03.856 --> 22:06.292
the most difficult
and important job in the world.

22:06.859 --> 22:10.363
Well, I gotta get back.
The whole staff is still working.

22:10.430 --> 22:11.798
Only because you are.

22:11.864 --> 22:14.200
Come on. I'll call 'em,
and send them home.

22:14.267 --> 22:15.568
You need a break.

22:15.635 --> 22:18.204
You haven't stopped
since the service this morning.

22:18.271 --> 22:20.273
- God, was that this morning?
- Mm-hm.

22:20.506 --> 22:22.975
First there was the
whole press secretary thing,

22:23.042 --> 22:25.445
and then the
Democratic leadership was...

22:25.511 --> 22:28.514
And, of course, you heard
about the Tucker Baynes disaster.

22:28.581 --> 22:30.850
The press has me
all tied in with him now.

22:30.917 --> 22:34.620
Now General Keaton wants to have
his name withdrawn from consideration.

22:34.687 --> 22:38.458
- We gotta fix this thing right away.
- Just let it wait till the morning.

22:38.524 --> 22:40.993
And I'm not so sure
it's such a disaster.

22:41.060 --> 22:44.931
- But Baynes is Templeton's guy.
- That doesn't make him a bad choice.

22:44.997 --> 22:48.034
I've been thinking.
You should work off of Templeton's list.

22:48.100 --> 22:49.502
Hmm.

22:49.569 --> 22:51.904
Let me introduce you to your bedroom.

22:51.971 --> 22:53.840
- Oh, wow.
- Mm-hm.

22:55.608 --> 22:56.809
This is...

22:56.876 --> 23:00.112
- This is just like the other place.
- Mm-hm.

23:00.179 --> 23:03.049
Look, even Amy's painting
is in exactly the same place.

23:03.115 --> 23:05.318
Yeah. Just like we've always been here.

23:05.384 --> 23:09.522
Oh. So Templeton's list.
You think I should go with a Republican?

23:09.589 --> 23:11.724
I think we should do whatever it takes

23:11.791 --> 23:15.294
to make a viable Allen administration.
Let the speaker be a kingmaker.

23:15.361 --> 23:18.030
He'll give us the relationship
that we need on the Hill.

23:18.097 --> 23:20.166
Mmm. I'm still stuck on Keaton.

23:20.233 --> 23:23.970
Well, if you stay stuck on Keaton,
his confirmation hearing is going to be

23:24.036 --> 23:26.772
like a recap of his
greatest one-liners attacking you.

23:26.839 --> 23:29.775
I get that. But, you know,
when he talks, he means what he says.

23:29.842 --> 23:33.045
He's got common sense backed up
with real world experience.

23:33.112 --> 23:36.516
And he does not have
a duplicitous bone in his body.

23:36.582 --> 23:38.551
Enough shop talk, kiddo.

23:40.887 --> 23:43.756
- I am so exhausted.
- [Rod] It's to be expected.

23:46.425 --> 23:49.362
You realize that, uh,
John and Jackie slept here?

23:49.428 --> 23:52.164
- Huh! Yeah.
- Pretty amazing, huh?

23:52.231 --> 23:56.135
- Mmm.
- First female president.

23:59.472 --> 24:00.806
'Night.

24:03.843 --> 24:05.912
[phone rings]

24:05.978 --> 24:07.547
[Mac groans]

24:08.748 --> 24:10.516
- There you go.
- Thank you.

24:10.583 --> 24:12.585
- Yeah.
- [man] Sorry to disturb you,

24:12.652 --> 24:15.955
- we need to speak with you immediately.
- OK. I'll be right there.

24:16.022 --> 24:17.023
[groaning]

24:17.089 --> 24:19.292
We scoured the
vice-presidential residence.

24:19.358 --> 24:21.227
I went where Velour said it would be...

24:21.294 --> 24:23.596
Just so you know,
Rebecca hates that code name.

24:23.663 --> 24:26.966
We're concerned one of the movers
may have possession of the diary.

24:27.033 --> 24:28.834
He may try and sell it to the tabloids.

24:28.901 --> 24:31.704
Ma'am, she said she may
have written things about you.

24:33.239 --> 24:36.275
Kelly, the only person who's
had a longer day than I have.

24:36.342 --> 24:37.376
What do you think?

24:37.443 --> 24:40.580
From a press point of view,
there's nothing that can be done.

24:40.646 --> 24:43.316
What she's trying to say
is we can't go to the tabloids.

24:43.382 --> 24:46.519
If we go to the tabloids
we won't be the only one tracing it.

24:46.586 --> 24:47.820
She's 16 years old.

24:47.887 --> 24:50.356
Whateverâ€˜s in that diary,
we don't want printed.

24:50.423 --> 24:52.625
Can you rack your brain, ma'am?
Think back.

24:52.692 --> 24:56.262
Did you ever, for any reason,
share sensitive material with Rebecca?

24:56.495 --> 24:58.998
Well, I didn't give her
the nuclear codes.

24:59.065 --> 25:00.700
- [laughing]
- [Mac] Come on.

25:00.766 --> 25:04.437
If you need to know what's in
the diary, there's only one place to go.

25:07.139 --> 25:10.209
[man 1] There anything in the diary
that mentions the president?

25:10.276 --> 25:11.677
Uh, yeah, I guess so.

25:11.744 --> 25:14.313
[man 2] Anything that might
be perceived as damaging?

25:14.380 --> 25:15.615
I... I don't know.

25:15.681 --> 25:18.417
You write about anything
the president officially did?

25:18.484 --> 25:21.320
Look, I don't know.
I don't remember what's in the diary.

25:21.387 --> 25:23.389
[man 3] Details
about your personal life?

25:23.456 --> 25:28.995
Maybe you have something
written about drugs? Sex?

25:29.061 --> 25:31.631
OK, guys. Could we just
slow down a little bit here?

25:31.697 --> 25:32.732
[man] Excuse me.

25:33.132 --> 25:37.103
Sweetie, I want you to tell
the Secret Service everything

25:37.169 --> 25:41.240
you remember about that diary.
I want you to be completely honest.

25:41.307 --> 25:44.644
And not a word of it
gets back to me, OK?

25:44.710 --> 25:47.179
- [Joan] Yes, ma'am.
- OK.

25:50.516 --> 25:51.517
Guys...

25:51.584 --> 25:55.187
Is the choice of Baynes a tribute to
what Teddy Bridges would have wanted?

25:55.254 --> 25:57.890
Neither Baynes nor anyone else
has been selected.

25:57.957 --> 25:59.558
[all] Kelly! Kelly! Kelly!

25:59.625 --> 26:01.694
Gallup shows 68 percent approval.

26:01.761 --> 26:04.997
- We're getting ahead of ourselves.
- Can't you be straight?

26:05.064 --> 26:07.833
- You obviously leaked the name.
- I did no such thing.

26:14.140 --> 26:16.042
- It's not lit.
- I don't smoke.

26:16.108 --> 26:18.277
I'm just preparing for the inevitable.

26:20.079 --> 26:22.848
- I saw your briefings.
- You think it's funny?

26:23.015 --> 26:25.518
You have the most
important job in the White House.

26:25.584 --> 26:28.287
- The most difficult to learn.
- I'm letting her down.

26:28.354 --> 26:31.757
You've been with us from the start.
You're battle-tested, loyal.

26:31.824 --> 26:33.693
You're tough when you need to be.

26:33.759 --> 26:37.229
Your president called upon you
because she trusts you.

26:37.296 --> 26:40.166
Because she knows
you'll lay on train tracks for her.

26:40.232 --> 26:43.369
- Is that enough?
- It is if the press realizes that.

26:43.436 --> 26:44.970
They'll respect you for it.

26:45.037 --> 26:47.506
So, you just... You tell it like it is.

26:48.340 --> 26:51.577
The lingo you learn,
the respect you earn.

26:51.644 --> 26:53.345
I'll see ya.

26:56.982 --> 26:59.085
[Jayne] I was in Oklahoma
for the primary.

26:59.151 --> 27:01.620
You were with the Bridges campaign.

27:01.687 --> 27:04.590
I don't know why we challenged
Oklahoma's favorite son.

27:04.657 --> 27:06.892
- [chuckling] Well...
- Sorry, guys.

27:06.959 --> 27:09.695
- Hey, Nate.
- No. Sit, sit, sit. Please.

27:09.762 --> 27:12.231
- You don't have a drink.
- Oh, I'm good. Thanks.

27:13.032 --> 27:14.600
Base-closing talks.

27:14.667 --> 27:16.836
It's OK, your Fort Sill is safe.

27:16.902 --> 27:19.505
- They treatin' you all right at the...
- Hay-Adams.

27:19.572 --> 27:22.308
- Hay-Adams.
- Oh, great. Great. You ever stay there?

27:22.374 --> 27:25.144
No, no, no. I like my own bed
over in Arlington.

27:25.211 --> 27:27.713
- [Nathan] The president contacted you?
- Not yet.

27:27.780 --> 27:29.548
Oh, boy.

27:29.615 --> 27:31.617
Ah, dear. Well, I'm not surprised.

27:31.684 --> 27:33.152
It's a mess over there.

27:33.219 --> 27:36.188
She had to fire her husband
as her chief of staff,

27:36.255 --> 27:39.024
so that's in a crisis mode.

27:39.091 --> 27:42.728
Press secretary's gone.
Secretary of labor's gone south.

27:42.795 --> 27:45.931
DOD's up in arms
over the Nigerian business.

27:45.998 --> 27:48.300
Well, she must've
gotten a spike for that.

27:48.367 --> 27:49.702
Right? I mean, women?

27:49.769 --> 27:52.171
The numbers aren't real.
They're emotional.

27:52.238 --> 27:53.973
What the White House needs

27:54.039 --> 27:57.743
is a man like you to go in there
and right the ship of state.

27:57.810 --> 27:59.578
- Literally.
- Figuratively.

28:01.947 --> 28:05.017
If this isn't real,
I'm gonna come off as a horse's ass.

28:05.084 --> 28:08.721
- Have you had her ear on this?
- No, not hers.

28:08.788 --> 28:12.858
No. Jim Gardner. Good man. Ours.

28:13.459 --> 28:16.295
No, of course, you're there.
On the list. At the top.

28:17.696 --> 28:18.998
Am I confirmable?

28:19.064 --> 28:21.734
You've got the Republicans,
maybe half the Democrats.

28:24.270 --> 28:28.541
Why did you turn it down, Nate?
The vice-presidency?

28:30.142 --> 28:31.844
This office.

28:33.345 --> 28:36.715
- I couldn't leave. I love it.
- Governor, I apologize,

28:36.782 --> 28:41.020
- but you've got that meeting with APEC.
- Oh, boy. I gotta go.

28:43.322 --> 28:44.323
[grunting]

28:44.390 --> 28:46.892
You look great. You look just great.

28:47.793 --> 28:50.396
- Vice-presidential.
- [Tucker laughs]

29:02.241 --> 29:05.244
- You guys met with Baynes?
- What, no preliminaries?

29:09.248 --> 29:12.017
The speaker knows and admires
the governor and would be

29:12.084 --> 29:14.920
very supportive
if he were the nominee...

29:14.987 --> 29:16.989
...and sees a quick confirmation.

29:17.957 --> 29:19.225
What's going on, Jayne?

29:20.226 --> 29:23.429
What's going on is Mackenzie Allen
needs to show a little respect.

29:23.495 --> 29:26.232
She was presented with a list
of five pre-approved names

29:26.298 --> 29:29.101
and no effort has been made
to even make contact with them.

29:29.168 --> 29:31.437
We don't vet
through the speaker's office.

29:32.037 --> 29:35.007
You know, if she won't
make this happen, we will.

29:35.074 --> 29:36.642
I don't take ultimatums well.

29:36.709 --> 29:38.978
It doesn't matter
if you take them well, Jim.

29:39.044 --> 29:40.880
It only matters if she does.

29:43.015 --> 29:46.252
Go with Baynes. He's a winner.

29:53.192 --> 29:55.327
Honestly, I think Keaton's a lost cause.

29:55.394 --> 29:58.330
- The president shouldn't chase.
- What are you suggesting?

29:59.465 --> 30:01.467
Baynes is a solid choice.

30:03.402 --> 30:05.971
There's something I'm not buying.

30:06.038 --> 30:08.674
Why is Templeton
pushing so hard on Baynes?

30:08.741 --> 30:11.477
Why empower the one man
who could challenge him

30:11.543 --> 30:13.512
for his party's nomination in two years?

30:15.147 --> 30:16.782
Maybe Templeton isn't running.

30:17.816 --> 30:19.218
Jim.

30:21.687 --> 30:23.322
- Hey.
- Hey.

30:23.389 --> 30:25.457
[Horace continues typing]

30:27.159 --> 30:29.561
- What's up?
- Nothing. Just bored.

30:32.264 --> 30:36.035
- Bec, it's gonna be OK.
- No, it's not.

30:36.769 --> 30:38.504
It's going to really, really suck.

30:41.373 --> 30:42.675
You're in it too.

30:44.209 --> 30:46.145
What? The diary?

30:46.211 --> 30:50.015
Oh, man. Don't tell me that.
What did you say?

30:50.082 --> 30:53.252
You know, next time you wanna
bitch about your life on paper,

30:53.319 --> 30:55.321
bitch about your life. Not mine.

30:56.388 --> 30:58.590
- Horace?
- What?

30:58.657 --> 31:00.326
I'm sorry.

31:02.995 --> 31:04.630
They'll find it.

31:04.697 --> 31:06.365
I mean, Mom's the president.

31:06.432 --> 31:09.601
If she doesn't have the resources,
then who does?

31:11.537 --> 31:12.871
They better find it.

31:14.807 --> 31:17.409
[Kelly] That was the
13th question on the subject.

31:17.476 --> 31:19.912
Gonna give the same answer.
"We're in the process.

31:19.979 --> 31:22.281
- No decisions yet."
- [all] Kelly! Kelly!

31:22.348 --> 31:24.650
- How â€˜bout a new subject?
- Hurrah. Yes.

31:24.717 --> 31:27.586
Some of us are still sketchy
on the decision-making

31:27.653 --> 31:29.755
that went into the rescue
of Oria Madula.

31:29.822 --> 31:33.025
- Can you tell us the motivations?
- The motivations?

31:33.092 --> 31:36.061
Was she acting
as a representative of women?

31:40.032 --> 31:44.436
Oria Madula was to be brutally tortured
until she died because she had

31:44.503 --> 31:48.007
a child out of wedlock.
Stoned until her skull caved in.

31:48.073 --> 31:51.110
The president wasn't
acting as a representative of women.

31:51.176 --> 31:54.246
She was acting as a
representative of the human race.

31:57.783 --> 31:59.351
Hey, uh, Kelly!

31:59.418 --> 32:00.853
- Kelly...
- Yeah. Charlie

32:00.919 --> 32:02.855
- You're getting the hang of it.
- Yeah.

32:02.921 --> 32:04.156
- That was nice.
- Thanks.

32:04.223 --> 32:06.558
I need a comment
from the president. A reaction.

32:06.625 --> 32:07.626
To what?

32:07.693 --> 32:10.796
I'm running a story in The Post tomorrow
about your guy, Baynes.

32:10.863 --> 32:12.164
I never said he was our guy.

32:12.231 --> 32:14.666
About this out-of-court
settlement that he made.

32:14.733 --> 32:16.368
About three years ago.

32:16.435 --> 32:19.405
- See? Second paragraph?
- This is for real?

32:19.471 --> 32:21.106
Absolutely.

32:24.676 --> 32:26.745
- [clock chimes]
- [groans]

32:32.284 --> 32:34.219
Hey, Tommy.

32:34.286 --> 32:36.755
- How you doin'?
- I'm OK, Mrs. Allen.

32:36.822 --> 32:38.791
[Grace] That's President Allen, Tommy.

32:38.857 --> 32:41.460
- Honey, what are you doing out of bed?
- Getting milk.

32:41.527 --> 32:43.729
All right. Let's go.
OK. Go, go, go. It's late.

32:43.796 --> 32:48.000
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, no. How's he, uh, holding up?

32:48.067 --> 32:50.669
Oh. Better than his old lady.

32:50.736 --> 32:52.838
- Mmm.
- Thank you so much for your patience

32:52.905 --> 32:54.973
- Oh, Grace... Grace.
- and hospitality.

32:55.040 --> 32:58.310
You were a wonderful first lady.
You're a national treasure.

32:58.377 --> 33:02.548
- Anything I can ever do for you.
- Teddy... Ah.

33:04.416 --> 33:06.685
Oh...

33:06.752 --> 33:09.455
- Good night.
- Good night, Grace.

33:09.521 --> 33:11.423
- Hi, Jim.
- Mrs. Bridges.

33:12.825 --> 33:14.626
[Mac] Hey, what's going on?

33:14.693 --> 33:17.362
Charlie's working on
a story for tomorrow's Post.

33:17.429 --> 33:20.799
- It's about Tucker Baynes.
- Oh, my vice president I never chose.

33:20.866 --> 33:23.669
His first year as governor,
a female staffer approached

33:23.735 --> 33:26.405
his attorneys with allegations
of sexual harassment.

33:26.472 --> 33:28.941
- How'd that turn out?
- Case never made it to court.

33:29.007 --> 33:30.542
Never even made it to the press.

33:30.609 --> 33:34.279
But an e-mail that she sent his
lawyer two years ago has surfaced.

33:34.346 --> 33:37.483
Dated March the 17th, she claims
that Baynes made lewd comments.

33:37.549 --> 33:39.218
He called her repeatedly at home.

33:39.284 --> 33:42.421
On March 18th, she quits
the governor's staff and is issued

33:42.488 --> 33:46.191
a $200,000 check by a lobbying firm
owned by his brother.

33:46.258 --> 33:49.361
Ostensibly, a signing bonus,
but she never worked there.

33:49.428 --> 33:51.897
- [Kelly] He paid her off.
- Post is gonna hold this

33:51.964 --> 33:54.366
- as your first faux pas.
- Baynes is not my choice.

33:54.433 --> 33:57.903
Far as the press and country's
concerned, he is. That's the perception.

33:57.970 --> 34:00.139
Tell Charlie he was
never in consideration.

34:00.205 --> 34:03.542
But he was on Templeton's list.
Which he gave to you.

34:03.609 --> 34:06.345
Meaning he was in consideration.

34:08.380 --> 34:10.047
Templeton put this out, right?

34:10.114 --> 34:12.317
He had this up his sleeve,
he pulled it out.

34:12.384 --> 34:15.554
- Why the hell wasn't this in our file?
- We just started vetting him!

34:17.589 --> 34:19.056
Sorry.

34:21.659 --> 34:23.962
You tell Charlie
our comment is "no comment."

34:24.029 --> 34:26.264
This ends now.

34:27.399 --> 34:29.101
- Operator.
- [female] Yes, ma'am.

34:29.168 --> 34:31.203
Get me General Warren Fitzgerald Keaton.

34:31.270 --> 34:34.706
Tell him his
commander in chief is calling.

34:42.014 --> 34:43.715
- [Mac] Hey, guys.
- [Becca] Hi, Mom.

34:43.782 --> 34:46.118
- [Rod] How are you?
- Amy, is that a donut?

34:46.185 --> 34:49.922
- Uh, they just gave it to me.
- Did you ask for it?

34:49.987 --> 34:51.556
- Uh-huh.
- Uh-huh.

34:56.628 --> 34:59.731
- You should be watching out for her.
- Me? What about Horace?

34:59.798 --> 35:02.968
I'm lucky if Horace
isn't having pizza for breakfast.

35:04.102 --> 35:05.871
You can be a real pain sometimes.

35:05.938 --> 35:07.472
Yeah, and you're a virgin.

35:11.109 --> 35:12.411
It's in your book.

35:17.683 --> 35:20.285
- Oh, my God.
- It was in my room when we moved in.

35:20.352 --> 35:22.487
- Give me that!
- Hey! But I'm not finished.

35:22.554 --> 35:23.789
Yeah. Yeah, you are.

35:25.190 --> 35:27.292
Horace, what's a virgin?

35:31.964 --> 35:34.733
OK. I have to do some homework.

35:35.367 --> 35:37.569
[clearing throat] Excuse me.

35:43.308 --> 35:47.012
Listen, that is Rebecca's private diary.

35:47.079 --> 35:49.081
You're not supposed to read it.

35:49.848 --> 35:51.149
Sorry, Rebecca.

35:51.216 --> 35:52.884
[sighs]

35:55.721 --> 35:58.523
When was the last time
you were at the White House, sir?

35:58.590 --> 36:00.692
Oh, a couple administrations ago.

36:00.759 --> 36:04.029
I had to give the president
a tongue-lashing about his

36:04.096 --> 36:06.765
expert target packaging in the Balkans.

36:06.832 --> 36:10.168
Oh, I see. I will let the president
know that you're here.

36:11.069 --> 36:14.039
- You an Arab?
- Palestinian, sir.

36:14.773 --> 36:17.676
[speaking Arabic]

36:18.977 --> 36:21.446
I'm sorry, sir. I do not speak Arabic.

36:23.382 --> 36:25.617
- Tell her I'm here.
- Yes, sir.

36:27.419 --> 36:29.321
- [knocking on door]
- Come in.

36:31.790 --> 36:33.191
Ma'am. The general is here.

36:33.258 --> 36:35.927
OK. Give it a minute
and then bring him in.

36:43.535 --> 36:46.338
And under a Bridges administration,
I assure you

36:46.405 --> 36:48.740
that there will be no
raising of the income tax

36:48.807 --> 36:51.476
and Social Security will remain intact.

36:51.543 --> 36:55.347
Those two goals are not mutually
exclusive and that's where

36:55.414 --> 36:56.848
General Keaton and I differ.

36:56.915 --> 36:59.351
[applause]

37:00.686 --> 37:03.055
[man 1] This time we'll
start with you, general.

37:03.121 --> 37:05.057
[man 2] What do you feel in your heart

37:05.123 --> 37:08.493
you'll bring to the ticket of
Governor Crawford? Why'd he pick you?

37:08.560 --> 37:10.862
I think my wife
asked that same question.

37:11.963 --> 37:15.067
That's two questions, really.
So here's the first answer.

37:15.133 --> 37:18.337
I've served my country for decades,
since I entered West Point.

37:18.403 --> 37:21.673
I've taken orders as a soldier.
I've given orders as a general.

37:21.740 --> 37:25.043
I've worked with the United Nations
on key peacekeeping missions.

37:25.110 --> 37:28.613
I know how to lead, and I know
what's good for this country.

37:28.680 --> 37:31.283
Now question number two.
Why'd he pick me?

37:31.350 --> 37:36.021
Hell, Governor Crawford
didn't pick me, his team picked me.

37:36.088 --> 37:40.759
The governor has no military experience,
and some people say he's too liberal.

37:40.826 --> 37:43.095
So I help him on the John Wayne front.

37:43.161 --> 37:45.397
Folks, that's what politics is.

37:45.464 --> 37:48.700
We are there
to help our guy get elected.

37:48.767 --> 37:50.068
Mackenzie Allen?

37:50.135 --> 37:54.406
She was picked because Teddy Bridges
needed help with the soccer moms.

37:54.473 --> 37:57.576
Everybody knows
that's why we're here.

37:57.642 --> 38:01.646
- [mediator] That's time.
- [applause]

38:01.713 --> 38:03.949
Ms. Allen? Your response?

38:04.015 --> 38:07.352
All this time I thought
I brought the John Wayne factor.

38:07.419 --> 38:09.488
[laughter]

38:09.554 --> 38:12.324
[Vince] Madam President? Ma'am?

38:12.391 --> 38:15.394
- General Keaton.
- Warren. Come on in.

38:15.460 --> 38:16.795
Madam President.

38:16.862 --> 38:19.197
- This is not gonna happen.
- So they tell me.

38:20.031 --> 38:22.834
- Good of you to come in anyway.
- Old habits.

38:22.901 --> 38:26.438
When summoned
by my commander in chief.

38:27.305 --> 38:31.009
[Warren] This is really something.
I never thought I'd see the day.

38:31.076 --> 38:33.145
Yeah, I know what you mean.

38:33.211 --> 38:34.413
So?

38:34.479 --> 38:37.749
Our country lost their president.
A robust, athletic man.

38:37.816 --> 38:39.217
They see it can happen.

38:39.284 --> 38:42.854
Country's not gonna be fully recovered
till we have a vice president.

38:42.921 --> 38:47.592
Of course. It just won't be me.
We disagree on too much.

38:47.692 --> 38:50.295
- Like?
- Number one, you're wrong on Israel.

38:50.362 --> 38:52.497
Number two, you're wrong on gun control.

38:52.564 --> 38:54.900
Number three,
you're wrong on school vouchers.

38:54.966 --> 38:57.335
Sounds to me like three reasons
why you'd wanna be

38:57.402 --> 39:01.139
- in a position to influence me.
- Ah, influence.

39:01.773 --> 39:03.508
You know...

39:03.575 --> 39:06.711
...vice president is really
being secretary of the useless.

39:06.778 --> 39:09.648
- Why'd you join Crawford's ticket?
- He offered me state.

39:09.714 --> 39:12.184
- He offered you state?
- What can I tell ya?

39:12.250 --> 39:15.554
If you want a man
who's worth a damn in this job,

39:15.620 --> 39:18.657
you gotta make this job worth a damn.

39:18.723 --> 39:20.292
No offense.

39:23.261 --> 39:25.130
You wanna know something, Warren?

39:25.197 --> 39:29.067
For all your shoot from the hip,
hoo-ha bravado,

39:29.134 --> 39:32.370
you are absolutely full of crap.

39:32.437 --> 39:34.306
- Beg your pardon?
- You're here.

39:34.372 --> 39:36.975
That tells me you do want the job.
I want you to have it.

39:37.042 --> 39:39.044
But I'm not gonna give you state.

39:39.110 --> 39:41.246
You should consider this
an honor, Warren.

39:41.313 --> 39:43.615
Salute and join the team.

39:43.682 --> 39:45.851
It's time to step up and be a man.

39:48.353 --> 39:50.789
Were you this respectful
to Tucker Baynes?

39:50.856 --> 39:53.625
Tucker Baynes is a
Templeton plant, and you know it.

39:53.692 --> 39:56.361
Yeah. But you have
to hand it to Nathan.

39:56.428 --> 39:59.397
- He knows how the game is played.
- Let me tell you something.

39:59.464 --> 40:02.267
When they see us together,
they're gonna see two people

40:02.334 --> 40:05.070
who compliment each other's
strengths and weaknesses.

40:05.136 --> 40:08.406
Two people who know how to
fight hard and still respect each other.

40:08.473 --> 40:11.943
And two people who sure as hell
don't play any games.

40:12.010 --> 40:14.913
OK, ma'am. No games.

40:14.980 --> 40:18.416
I don't see a reason why I
should join this administration.

40:18.483 --> 40:22.654
You're an Independent. In two years
you'll run as an Independent.

40:22.721 --> 40:25.790
You stand an Independent's chance
of winning, which is zero.

40:25.857 --> 40:29.060
Why in God's name
should I want to join a losing team?

40:29.127 --> 40:32.864
You're probably right.
I probably am gonna lose.

40:32.931 --> 40:37.068
But, knowing that, I'm not gonna
waste my time trying to get popular.

40:37.135 --> 40:39.437
I'm not gonna
waste my time campaigning.

40:39.504 --> 40:43.241
For the next two years I'm gonna
do one thing and one thing only.

40:43.308 --> 40:45.977
That's what's right
for the American people.

40:46.044 --> 40:48.813
What are you gonna do
with your next two years, Warren?

40:50.715 --> 40:51.716
[clamoring]

40:51.783 --> 40:54.486
Does the White House
have a response to the allegations

40:54.553 --> 40:57.055
against President Allen's choice,
Tucker Baynes.

40:57.122 --> 41:00.325
Sorry, we don't comment on allegations.
We only comment on facts.

41:00.392 --> 41:03.428
Baynes is not, nor has he ever,
been President Allen's choice.

41:03.495 --> 41:06.164
- That's just you all speculating.
- Who is her choice?

41:06.231 --> 41:08.567
Kelly. I can take that one.

41:11.236 --> 41:14.172
Ladies and gentlemen,
the president of the United States.

41:16.074 --> 41:17.642
[Mac] Please, be seated.

41:21.346 --> 41:23.048
Ladies and gentlemen.

41:23.114 --> 41:26.017
I am very proud to present to you

41:26.084 --> 41:28.587
the next vice president
of the United States,

41:28.653 --> 41:33.258
- General Warren Fitzgerald Keaton.
- [applause]

41:41.833 --> 41:45.570
Write it like this. President Allen's
shocked the political establishment

41:45.637 --> 41:46.871
by picking her opponent,

41:46.938 --> 41:50.442
her political enemy
from her vice-presidential run,

41:50.508 --> 41:52.711
General Warren Fitzgerald Keaton.

41:52.777 --> 41:55.580
[Nathan] He goes to sleep,
the Chicago Tribune says

41:55.597 --> 41:58.133
he's president.
He wakes up in the morning...

41:58.249 --> 42:00.018
- Hey, boss.
- [applause on TV]

42:00.885 --> 42:03.455
[reporter] General Keaton.
When were you notified?

42:03.521 --> 42:04.656
[sniffing]

42:04.723 --> 42:07.993
- [crowd laughing]
- About ten minutes ago.

42:08.126 --> 42:12.364
How's it feel to sit next to President
Allen as opposed to across from her?

42:12.364 --> 42:15.066
[Warren] It feels like being
in the shadow of greatness.

42:15.133 --> 42:18.003
I look forward
to working with the Senate...

42:18.069 --> 42:21.106
- He won't be confirmed.
- Not a chance.

42:21.172 --> 42:23.375
[Warren continues talking]
