WEBVTT

00:07.050 --> 00:10.010
Previously
on "Better Call Saul"...

00:10.053 --> 00:12.403
Four for unlock,
five for lock.

00:12.447 --> 00:14.144
I gotta tell ya,
it does not sound like

00:14.188 --> 00:16.190
the Howard Hamlin
that I know.

00:16.233 --> 00:18.627
You're going to forget you ever
heard the name Howard Hamlin.

00:18.670 --> 00:22.022
Lalo is dead.

00:22.065 --> 00:23.806
The DA's office
put it together

00:23.849 --> 00:25.982
that Lalo was calling himself
"de Guzman."

00:26.026 --> 00:27.636
What do you think
we should do?

00:27.679 --> 00:28.854
Do you want to be a friend
of the cartel

00:28.898 --> 00:31.248
or do you want to be
a rat?

00:31.292 --> 00:35.992
-What did you learn?
-Lalo Salamanca lives.

01:40.535 --> 01:41.927
Oh, no.

01:41.971 --> 01:43.494
Really?

01:43.538 --> 01:45.714
I thought it'd be
just the trim.

01:45.757 --> 01:48.282
Of all the colors,
why would you pick that?

01:48.325 --> 01:52.416
Use adobe red,
if you want red.

01:52.460 --> 01:54.679
What do you even
call that?

01:54.723 --> 01:57.073
Fire engine red?

01:57.117 --> 01:58.857
Tomato red.

01:58.901 --> 02:00.946
Their poor
neighbors.

02:00.990 --> 02:03.253
Mmh.
Mmh.

02:27.973 --> 02:31.194
Ugh.
What an eyesore.

02:31.238 --> 02:33.327
There's no way
the Homeowners' Association

02:33.370 --> 02:36.068
approved that color.

02:36.112 --> 02:38.506
Barb's gonna have a cow.

02:38.549 --> 02:39.681
Whew.

02:39.724 --> 02:43.163
Maybe I could put a bug
in her ear...

02:43.206 --> 02:45.208
What can Barb do?

02:45.252 --> 02:47.167
That place isn't even
in Mountain View.

02:47.210 --> 02:49.256
It's Enchantment Hills
over there.

02:49.299 --> 02:51.954
Enchantment Hills starts
at Pinon Lane.

02:51.997 --> 02:55.175
Remember when the Westlakes
planted those Quaking Aspens?

02:55.218 --> 02:57.829
That whole mess?

02:57.873 --> 02:59.788
I thought
the Westlakes proved

02:59.831 --> 03:03.270
their lot was in
Enchantment Hills.

03:03.313 --> 03:05.228
They paid for
a land survey.

03:05.272 --> 03:08.013
Really?

03:08.057 --> 03:09.754
Where'd you hear that?

03:09.798 --> 03:12.801
Robbie Davis, maybe.

03:12.844 --> 03:15.499
I'll double-check the map
after I shower.

03:19.634 --> 03:21.375
Want some?

03:21.418 --> 03:22.985
Nah. I'm good.

03:32.429 --> 03:34.649
Is that iced tea?

03:34.692 --> 03:36.999
Mrs.
Would you like some?

03:37.042 --> 03:39.654
Love some.
Thank you, Ma'am.

05:13.487 --> 05:15.053
How's it going?

05:15.097 --> 05:17.534
Eh. Status quo.

05:17.578 --> 05:20.842
You know,
hummin' along.

05:20.885 --> 05:23.975
We did land a pretty big client
last week, though.

05:24.019 --> 05:26.369
Insurance outfit
in Santa Fe.

05:26.413 --> 05:29.503
They cover most of the high-end
real estate up there.

05:29.546 --> 05:31.331
Great.

05:32.636 --> 05:35.378
But, Howard,
I'm not a shareholder.

05:35.422 --> 05:38.381
I'm -- I'm just
getting warmed up.

05:38.425 --> 05:41.297
Although I still think you would
make one hell of litigator.

05:41.341 --> 05:44.126
Ah. Appreciate that,
but I'll pass.

05:45.997 --> 05:49.784
At home, things are
more or less the same.

05:49.827 --> 05:51.786
It's not any worse --

05:51.829 --> 05:53.918
I guess I should be grateful
for that.

05:55.398 --> 05:58.053
It's like we're...

05:58.096 --> 05:59.707
deadlocked.

06:05.974 --> 06:10.021
Cheryl still won't talk about
anything...important.

06:11.458 --> 06:13.938
You tried
what we discussed?
Yes.

06:13.982 --> 06:16.724
Yes, Idid, but...

06:25.123 --> 06:27.691
I didhave a dream.

06:50.497 --> 06:52.542
So I look over
the old man's ticket,

06:52.586 --> 06:54.414
and it's clearly
an international flight,

06:54.457 --> 06:56.372
so we search for
his gate number --

06:56.416 --> 07:00.115
but all the signs are
in a language I can't read.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.522
Kim!

08:45.089 --> 08:46.395
Any traffic?

08:46.438 --> 08:48.092
Nope. Straight shot
down 25.

08:48.136 --> 08:49.833
This is us.

08:49.877 --> 08:51.269
Thanks for meeting me.

08:51.313 --> 08:53.576
I imagine you're swamped
when you're in town.

08:53.620 --> 08:55.578
Today's not too bad.
In fact, I have a meeting

08:55.622 --> 08:57.319
at your old stomping ground,
with Schweikart.

08:57.362 --> 08:59.495
Oh.
Tell Rich I said hi.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.323
Of course.
How's Jimmy?

09:01.366 --> 09:03.368
He's great.
Thanks for asking.

09:03.412 --> 09:05.153
How about Alice?She's doing well.

09:05.196 --> 09:08.765
She's taking up baking,
and, uh, no complaints here.

09:08.809 --> 09:11.681
Well, lucky you.Don't I know it.

09:11.725 --> 09:14.162
I hear this place
makes a killer latte.
Yeah.

09:14.205 --> 09:17.121
They give Java Joe's a run
for their money, if you ask me.

09:46.716 --> 09:49.980
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Come on!

09:50.024 --> 09:51.199
Had a customer.

09:51.242 --> 09:52.983
Okay, okay,
but it's time to go.

09:53.027 --> 09:54.855
C'mon!
We gotta get moving!

09:57.597 --> 10:00.425
Wait.
What are ya doing?

10:00.469 --> 10:01.731
No, no, no, no, no.
Hey. Come on.

10:01.775 --> 10:04.647
We gotta move.
We gotta move.

10:04.691 --> 10:05.822
I'm getting a root beer.

10:05.866 --> 10:07.345
No, no.
We have a schedule.

10:07.389 --> 10:08.564
Remember?
We discussed it.

10:08.608 --> 10:10.566
I put two quarters in.

10:10.610 --> 10:13.569
I will buy you an entire case
when we're done.

10:13.613 --> 10:17.704
Here we go.
Right in. Whew.

10:17.747 --> 10:19.749
All the way.

11:03.314 --> 11:04.359
Everything okay?

11:04.402 --> 11:06.100
Sure.

11:09.016 --> 11:10.974
Do we need to
go over it again?

11:11.018 --> 11:12.236
Nah.

11:13.629 --> 11:15.544
Well, just remember --

11:15.587 --> 11:16.806
keep your feet
out of the way

11:16.850 --> 11:19.722
'cause I'm gonna have to leave
in a hurry.

11:22.507 --> 11:24.074
What?

11:24.118 --> 11:27.251
I really like
your hair.

11:28.513 --> 11:30.864
It's not --
Thank you.

11:30.907 --> 11:33.475
Thanks.

11:35.172 --> 11:36.957
What if there was
a different way?

11:37.000 --> 11:38.915
What if there was an
independent team of lawyers --

11:38.959 --> 11:40.961
maybe four or five
of them --

11:41.004 --> 11:43.311
who were dedicated to taking on
the difficult cases?

11:43.354 --> 11:45.835
I'm not saying a few lawyers
can solve

11:45.879 --> 11:47.707
a massive,
systemic problem,

11:47.750 --> 11:50.666
but they could
make it better.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.712
And why come to me
with this?

11:54.409 --> 11:56.280
Well, if I wanted
to shine you on,

11:56.324 --> 11:57.586
I'd tell you it's because

11:57.629 --> 11:59.501
you're known for
your social conscience.

11:59.544 --> 12:00.937
But the truth is

12:00.981 --> 12:03.070
it's because of your connections
in state government.

12:03.113 --> 12:04.854
You can make things happen.

12:04.898 --> 12:06.943
Fair enough.

12:06.987 --> 12:10.077
Kim, the firm has
a service committee.

12:10.120 --> 12:11.948
I should tell you
to go to them

12:11.992 --> 12:15.604
and get in line with
all the other worthy causes.

12:15.647 --> 12:17.867
But you're putting your money
where your mouth is.

12:21.392 --> 12:24.439
I'm sure you've heard something
about my son's drug problem.

12:26.223 --> 12:28.312
Gregory's struggle
gave me a more, let's say,

12:28.356 --> 12:30.314
personal view
of the legal system.

12:32.099 --> 12:35.885
Kim, I think
you've got something here.

12:51.901 --> 12:53.816
You can't skimp
on the support staff.

12:53.860 --> 12:55.644
They're the beating heart
of the operation.

12:55.687 --> 12:58.299
I know that's true
in our office --

13:01.606 --> 13:03.957
No, no! No! No!

13:04.000 --> 13:05.088
Jesus.

13:05.132 --> 13:07.961
You son of a bitch!

13:09.266 --> 13:12.226
You twisted deadbeat
piece of shit!

13:12.269 --> 13:14.445
Wasn't that...Howard?

13:14.489 --> 13:15.838
God damn it!

13:15.882 --> 13:17.144
You owe me!

13:17.187 --> 13:18.232
Ma'am, are you okay?

13:18.275 --> 13:19.842
You owe me!
Ma'am...

13:19.886 --> 13:21.757
I mean...Nobody does that to me!

13:21.801 --> 13:23.977
I don't know.
It happened so fast.

13:24.020 --> 13:27.241
Damn it! He owes me!
What a rip-off!

13:27.284 --> 13:28.938
Damn you!

13:51.047 --> 13:53.049
No. No!

13:53.093 --> 13:55.225
They moved the cone?!

13:55.269 --> 13:58.968
What kinda asshole
moves a cone?!

14:00.578 --> 14:03.320
Ohh. Crap.

15:04.729 --> 15:05.992
Nngh!

15:11.258 --> 15:12.868
Nngh!

16:07.183 --> 16:10.186
Hey, listen.
Um...

16:10.230 --> 16:12.058
Be careful, okay?

16:13.146 --> 16:15.061
Okay.

16:19.152 --> 16:20.153
What?

16:20.196 --> 16:22.155
Five-O.

16:22.198 --> 16:24.722
That kills business
for the rest of the day.

16:25.854 --> 16:27.943
Always hassling me.

16:29.423 --> 16:30.990
Undercover cops?

16:31.033 --> 16:33.557
Yep.

16:33.601 --> 16:37.779
Well, listen, if you ever have
any legal problems,

16:37.822 --> 16:39.389
give me a call,
anytime.

16:39.433 --> 16:40.956
No charge.

16:43.263 --> 16:44.655
Thanks.

17:41.321 --> 17:44.237
- - So I pulled the Jag
into the loading zone

17:44.280 --> 17:45.586
and I start scrapping
with this hunk of metal.

17:45.629 --> 17:47.414
Oh, my God.It was in deep.

17:47.457 --> 17:49.894
Like down-a-well deep.

17:49.938 --> 17:52.462
So I just...wrestled it!

17:52.506 --> 17:54.334
Nngh!
Like a freakin' bear!

17:54.377 --> 17:58.555
And I -- nngh! -- jam it in
the dirt in front of the Jag.

17:58.599 --> 18:00.253
Boom!

18:00.296 --> 18:02.864
Barely made it out of there
by the skin of my teeth.

18:02.907 --> 18:04.909
Who moves cones?!

18:04.953 --> 18:08.130
Who does that?Narcissists.

18:08.174 --> 18:09.653
You're damn right.

18:12.047 --> 18:14.310
So you think
Cliff really bought it, huh?

18:14.354 --> 18:18.271
One hundred percent.
You should have seen his face.

18:18.314 --> 18:19.881
It landed, trust me.

18:21.665 --> 18:25.191
God, it was beautiful.

18:27.149 --> 18:29.673
Oh.
And that is not all.

18:29.717 --> 18:31.066
Spill.

18:31.110 --> 18:33.938
So,
I'm doing the stall,

18:33.982 --> 18:36.071
I'm telling Cliff
what I'm doing,

18:36.115 --> 18:37.464
what I wanna be doing.

18:37.507 --> 18:38.726
All I'm thinking about is

18:38.769 --> 18:40.945
I gotta stretch this out
until you get there.

18:40.989 --> 18:45.341
But then, I don't know,
I kind of got caught up in it.

18:45.385 --> 18:48.344
And then...

18:48.388 --> 18:49.737
Cliff went for it.

18:49.780 --> 18:53.915
I mean, like,
really went for it.

18:53.958 --> 18:56.135
What does that mean?
Like money?

18:56.178 --> 18:57.701
I-I don't think
he'll write a check himself.

18:57.745 --> 18:59.747
But he knows people.

18:59.790 --> 19:01.662
And I think
he'll deliver.

19:01.705 --> 19:02.924
You're kidding.

19:02.967 --> 19:05.448
I know!
How great is that?

19:05.492 --> 19:07.146
This is unbelievable.

19:07.189 --> 19:10.714
Are we on a roll
or are we on a roll?

19:10.758 --> 19:14.283
Geez.

19:19.506 --> 19:22.378
You ever feel like
you're being followed?

19:25.425 --> 19:27.688
When I dropped Wendy off
at the motel,

19:27.731 --> 19:30.865
she thought she was being
watched by some undercover cops.

19:30.908 --> 19:33.694
But then,
when I drove away,

19:33.737 --> 19:36.175
that same car
was behind me.

19:37.350 --> 19:39.917
Right after I spotted them,
they disappeared.

19:41.963 --> 19:44.183
Well,
you know what they say.

19:44.226 --> 19:48.143
"The wicked flee
when no man pursueth."

19:50.624 --> 19:52.713
You think we're wicked?

19:52.756 --> 19:54.715
No. What?

19:54.758 --> 19:56.369
It's just a turn of phrase.

19:59.067 --> 20:02.113
I think you're wicked hawt.

20:08.076 --> 20:09.338
Alright.

20:09.382 --> 20:12.036
Listen to the voice
of experience, okay?

20:12.080 --> 20:14.996
You know why
you're feeling like this?

20:15.039 --> 20:18.217
Because we got away
with it.

20:18.260 --> 20:20.871
It seems too good
to be true.

20:20.915 --> 20:24.048
But trust me,
nobody is following you.

20:25.876 --> 20:30.316
No one knows what we're doing
except for us.

20:30.359 --> 20:31.969
Okay?

20:36.017 --> 20:37.236
Okay.

20:39.673 --> 20:41.370
I get it.
Under the circumstances,

20:41.414 --> 20:43.546
I wouldn't want to be anywhere
near a police station

20:43.590 --> 20:45.679
if I were you either.

20:45.722 --> 20:47.246
I'll tell you what.

20:47.289 --> 20:50.031
Um, the mahogany
in my conference room

20:50.074 --> 20:51.685
is currently
getting buffed out,

20:51.728 --> 20:55.341
so I'm using my satellite office
at Juan Tabo and Skyline.

20:55.384 --> 20:58.474
I'm letting a nail salon,
you know, use the lobby,

20:58.518 --> 21:00.476
so my office is in the back.

21:00.520 --> 21:03.436
Meet me there at00.

21:03.479 --> 21:05.612
Great! Thanks.

21:05.655 --> 21:06.830
How's it hanging, Steve-O?

21:06.874 --> 21:09.355
Shoes. Belt. Jacket.

21:09.398 --> 21:10.660
I'm sorry. What?

21:10.704 --> 21:13.837
Shoes. Belt. Jacket.

21:13.881 --> 21:16.057
Seriously?
Since when?

21:16.100 --> 21:17.841
It's procedure, sir.

21:17.885 --> 21:19.930
"Sir"?

21:26.546 --> 21:29.070
Why'd Ihit the jackpot?

21:29.113 --> 21:30.637
Never can tell.

21:39.515 --> 21:42.257
Hey. How you doing
on this beautiful day?

21:44.694 --> 21:47.306
Did you, uh, catch
that cookie bouquet

21:47.349 --> 21:49.264
that I sent
for Carlos' birthday?

21:49.308 --> 21:50.874
'Cause I put a few extra

21:50.918 --> 21:53.616
white chocolate macadamias
in there, just for you.

21:54.400 --> 21:55.618
What do you need?

21:55.662 --> 21:58.099
Me? Uh - Nothing.
Nothing!

21:58.142 --> 22:00.319
But I have a "friend"
who could use a --

22:00.362 --> 22:02.625
a preliminary hearing
rescheduled.

22:02.669 --> 22:05.541
Uh,
Gonzalez v. New Mexico.

22:05.585 --> 22:09.371
My "friend" is looking for
a Friday around nine a.m. --

22:09.415 --> 22:11.330
you know, before the judge's
fourth cup of coffee

22:11.373 --> 22:13.941
because, uh,
caffeine jitters --

22:13.984 --> 22:16.509
they're brutal
on the defense, so...

22:16.552 --> 22:19.381
What "friend"?

22:19.425 --> 22:22.123
I don't believe
you two have met.

22:33.700 --> 22:35.005
What is this?

22:35.049 --> 22:37.486
A hearing change
request form.

22:38.574 --> 22:41.055
Hey, come on.
It's me...

22:41.098 --> 22:44.145
Look, Mommy.
I just graduated.

22:44.188 --> 22:47.583
I -- I can't use a pen.

22:47.627 --> 22:50.717
I have
no opposable thumbs.

23:02.511 --> 23:04.121
Hey! Hannah Banana!

23:04.165 --> 23:06.515
Hey, yourself.

23:23.619 --> 23:26.405
Come on, Bill.
That's no way to treat a lady.

23:26.448 --> 23:28.015
You got to make love to it,
Bill.

23:28.058 --> 23:30.800
You know, be gentle --
that's the way to do it.

23:30.844 --> 23:34.761
Think Barry White,
think seduction.

23:40.070 --> 23:41.855
Voilà.

23:45.554 --> 23:48.775
What the hell
is going on?

23:48.818 --> 23:50.429
How come
everyone's treating me

23:50.472 --> 23:52.822
like I'm covered
in oozing pus sores?

23:52.866 --> 23:54.215
I liked you better

23:54.258 --> 23:56.173
when you were just
a regular bottom feeder.

23:56.217 --> 23:57.479
But this...

23:57.523 --> 23:59.829
"This"?
What is "this"?

24:00.917 --> 24:03.354
I understand
advocating for your client.

24:03.398 --> 24:06.009
Deep in my heart,
I get it.

24:06.053 --> 24:08.751
But you scammed the court,
you scammed the judge.

24:08.795 --> 24:10.405
And for what?

24:10.449 --> 24:12.973
To get a murdering
cartel psychopath

24:13.016 --> 24:15.628
back out
on the street?

24:15.671 --> 24:17.804
It's just...

24:17.847 --> 24:19.458
wrong.

24:22.069 --> 24:24.463
That's a lotta big talk, Bill.
Prove it.

24:24.506 --> 24:26.247
Prove it, Bill!

24:27.466 --> 24:31.208
There's proving,
and then there's knowing.

24:37.476 --> 24:41.262
Abe, you don't want to go back
to county, do you?

24:41.305 --> 24:42.393
Nuh-uh.

24:42.437 --> 24:45.484
Okay.
So the meetings?

24:45.527 --> 24:47.268
I'll go.

24:47.311 --> 24:49.096
Great.

24:49.139 --> 24:53.448
Then I'll see you
Tuesday,

24:53.492 --> 24:55.232
nine a.m. sharp.

25:02.109 --> 25:04.067
You want this?

25:04.111 --> 25:06.287
I do.

25:09.551 --> 25:12.554
Take your time.

25:26.394 --> 25:28.091
Enjoy.

25:32.139 --> 25:35.055
Yeah, you can sit
anywhere you want. That's fine.

25:39.712 --> 25:42.323
Abe, would you mind
watching my stuff?

26:30.545 --> 26:32.286
Hey.
Hello.

26:32.329 --> 26:34.767
Nice day.

26:34.810 --> 26:36.595
Are you
following me?

26:36.638 --> 26:38.074
I'm sorry?

26:39.162 --> 26:43.166
Are you following me?

26:46.648 --> 26:48.607
What are you, APD?

26:52.915 --> 26:54.308
Know what?

26:54.351 --> 26:56.179
Ithink
you're following me,

26:56.223 --> 26:58.007
and if you're not gonna
identify yourselves,

26:58.051 --> 27:00.488
then I'm calling in your plates
because I feel threatened.

27:03.491 --> 27:05.972
Sorry
if we've disturbed you.

27:06.015 --> 27:08.844
You have a nice day,
ma'am.

27:53.236 --> 27:55.456
Oh, yeah. Yeah, please.

28:01.680 --> 28:04.117
Saul Goodman,
speedy justice for you.

28:05.901 --> 28:09.818
Uh, no, there's no charge
for the initial consultation.

28:09.862 --> 28:10.993
Today?

28:11.037 --> 28:13.039
Yeah, um...

28:13.082 --> 28:15.911
I have an opening
around30.

28:15.955 --> 28:19.001
Oh, I'm working
out of my satellite office.

28:19.045 --> 28:20.524
It's at Juan Tabo and Skyline.

28:20.568 --> 28:22.526
I'm letting a nail salon
use the lobby,

28:22.570 --> 28:25.878
so office is in back.

28:25.921 --> 28:28.881
Great.
Uh, your name?

28:28.924 --> 28:30.665
Dante.

28:30.709 --> 28:32.275
See you then.

28:37.063 --> 28:40.588
Saul Goodman,
speedy justice for you.

28:40.631 --> 28:43.504
Yeah. Uh, yeah.
I do have an opening today --

28:43.547 --> 28:46.681
Oh, hold on.
I'm getting another call.

28:46.725 --> 28:48.074
Saul Goodman,
speedy justice for you.

28:48.117 --> 28:49.815
Um, hold, please.

28:49.858 --> 28:51.555
My apologies.

28:51.599 --> 28:54.820
I'm having
a bit of a rush here today.

29:08.616 --> 29:11.140
You get these people out
right now.

29:11.184 --> 29:12.925
What? These guys?
Are they bothering you?

29:12.968 --> 29:15.754
Not them. Inside!

29:30.594 --> 29:32.553
Who's here to see
Saul Goodman?

29:34.207 --> 29:36.557
You're him?
You're Saul?

29:36.600 --> 29:37.906
Yeah.

29:41.605 --> 29:43.564
Then you're the guy,
right?

29:43.607 --> 29:45.914
What guy's that?

29:45.958 --> 29:48.525
Salamanca's guy.

29:50.614 --> 29:52.834
Yeah.

29:52.878 --> 29:54.836
That's me.

29:54.880 --> 29:57.404
Everybody who has
an appointment already --

29:57.447 --> 29:58.797
Uh, oh, you know --
you know what?

29:58.840 --> 30:00.886
Um...

30:03.671 --> 30:04.977
Uh, Mr. "Spooge"?

30:05.020 --> 30:06.761
It's just "Spooge."

30:06.805 --> 30:09.372
Just Spooge.
Duly noted. Alright.

30:09.416 --> 30:11.287
Um, Gael Morengo?

30:11.331 --> 30:13.855
Okay.
Uh, let's see.

30:13.899 --> 30:16.379
Is there a Dante?
Mm-hmm.

30:16.423 --> 30:19.034
And Rocco Kubler.
Okay.

30:19.078 --> 30:23.560
Everybody else, um,
kindly wait outside, alright?

30:23.604 --> 30:27.390
Unless -- Unless you desire
spa services while you wait.

30:27.434 --> 30:30.785
Uh, that's a separate
charge, but it-- it's
highly recommended.

30:30.829 --> 30:33.179
The -- The best pedicures
in Albuquerque,

30:33.222 --> 30:34.920
right here.

30:34.963 --> 30:37.618
Six.

30:37.661 --> 30:39.750
Lucky number seven.

30:39.794 --> 30:41.056
Oh, you're with him?

30:41.100 --> 30:42.928
And eight.

30:42.971 --> 30:44.364
Nice leathers.

30:44.407 --> 30:45.626
Uh, okay, together.

30:45.669 --> 30:47.280
And nine.

30:47.323 --> 30:48.716
Wow.

30:48.759 --> 30:51.197
Um, thank you all
for your patience.

30:51.240 --> 30:54.548
And...justice for all!

30:56.767 --> 30:58.944
Cucumber water
for paying customers only.

30:58.987 --> 31:02.469
Oh, believe me,
they're gonna be paying.

31:02.512 --> 31:03.818
"Spooge"!

31:05.515 --> 31:09.171
Oh, Spooge and friend.
Okay. Good. This way.

31:10.912 --> 31:13.567
Hi, ma'am.

31:16.962 --> 31:20.226
Yeah, hang -- hang a left
at the washing machine.

31:20.269 --> 31:21.662
There you go.

31:21.705 --> 31:23.098
I'll see you next week,
Rosa.

31:23.142 --> 31:25.144
And it was nice meeting you,
Pilar.

31:25.187 --> 31:27.407
Don't forget to bring as many
family members as you can.

31:27.450 --> 31:28.712
We will.
Thank you, Ms. Wexler.

31:28.756 --> 31:30.714
Take care.

31:42.465 --> 31:43.727
All done for today?

31:43.771 --> 31:45.425
Yeah. Here you go.

31:45.468 --> 31:47.253
Just keep it, Shelby.

31:47.296 --> 31:48.515
Thanks, Kim.
See you tomorrow?

31:48.558 --> 31:49.864
You bet.

31:52.475 --> 31:54.129
They're gone.

31:55.870 --> 31:58.525
I'm sorry?

31:58.568 --> 32:02.224
The two men
that were following you.

32:02.268 --> 32:03.834
They're gone.

32:05.314 --> 32:07.926
Do I know you?

32:07.969 --> 32:09.971
Would you mind
sitting for a moment?

32:10.015 --> 32:13.061
And I will answer
any questions I can.

32:28.598 --> 32:31.558
I have men watching you
and your husband.

32:31.601 --> 32:34.604
I'm not with the police,
and as far as I know,

32:34.648 --> 32:37.172
they're not investigating
either of you.

32:37.216 --> 32:40.349
I doknow that you've been
up to a few things

32:40.393 --> 32:43.787
that you probably
would rather keep private.

32:43.831 --> 32:45.789
I don't care.

32:45.833 --> 32:48.836
That's not
what this is about.

32:48.879 --> 32:52.579
I'm trying to solve
a problem of my own.

32:52.622 --> 32:54.755
What problem?

32:56.800 --> 32:58.933
Lalo Salamanca.

33:01.762 --> 33:04.939
Lalo Salamanca's dead.

33:11.163 --> 33:14.340
He...

33:14.383 --> 33:16.342
isn't.

33:17.821 --> 33:20.172
We're watching anyone
he might contact.

33:20.215 --> 33:22.826
That includes you
and your husband.

33:22.870 --> 33:24.611
Most likely,
he'll never reach out.

33:24.654 --> 33:27.657
He's got bigger fish
to fry.

33:27.701 --> 33:31.139
But in the thousand-to-one
chance that he does...

33:34.229 --> 33:36.710
And who do you
work for?

33:38.712 --> 33:41.367
I said I would answer
anything I can.

33:47.634 --> 33:49.592
You're the guy
from the desert.

33:50.985 --> 33:53.161
The one who was out there
with Jimmy.

33:56.469 --> 33:59.950
Why are you telling methis
and not him?

34:01.387 --> 34:05.130
Because I think you're made
of sterner stuff.

34:09.264 --> 34:11.919
Alright.

34:11.962 --> 34:14.878
Now here's what's best
for everyone.

34:14.922 --> 34:18.839
You spot my guys again,
which I'm hoping you won't,

34:18.882 --> 34:21.363
let them go about
their business.

34:21.407 --> 34:23.452
Just pretend
they're not there.

34:23.496 --> 34:27.500
And pretty soon
they won't be.

34:27.543 --> 34:29.458
You and your husband

34:29.502 --> 34:31.808
just...

34:31.852 --> 34:34.420
go on living your lives.

34:36.900 --> 34:38.598
I doknow you.

34:40.687 --> 34:43.385
You worked in the parking booth
at the courthouse.

34:44.908 --> 34:47.433
You're the attendant.

34:50.262 --> 34:52.394
I was.

35:44.316 --> 35:45.969
Hi...

36:10.603 --> 36:12.518
The markets will continue
to be in a state of flux

36:12.561 --> 36:14.389
until the Fed
tightens interest rates.

36:14.433 --> 36:16.130
Some days we'll feel
pretty good about the rate

36:16.174 --> 36:18.045
of economic recovery,
other days not so much.

36:18.088 --> 36:20.003
Because of these macro issues.

36:20.047 --> 36:24.094
The deficit, interest rates,
oil prices, what have you...

38:37.967 --> 38:41.493
Mrs.
I think I saw that somewhere.
Here!

38:41.536 --> 38:44.278
Mrs. Nope.

38:47.368 --> 38:50.153
How's youredge
coming along?

38:50.197 --> 38:54.070
I'm still missing two...

38:54.114 --> 38:56.116
Mr. You found
all your edge pieces.

38:56.159 --> 38:58.336
I thought I did.

38:58.379 --> 39:01.034
Maybe we lost a few.

39:01.077 --> 39:04.211
These trees
are killing me.

39:04.254 --> 39:07.127
The pieces all look
exactly the same.

39:07.170 --> 39:09.695
Then work on the cabin.I could.

39:38.027 --> 39:40.203
There was a green Ford van.

39:40.247 --> 39:43.032
It was behind me
for almost three blocks.

39:43.076 --> 39:45.861
A '98 Econoline.
We ran the plate.

39:45.905 --> 39:47.907
Guy's a freelance plumber.

39:47.950 --> 39:49.735
He's legit.

39:51.214 --> 39:53.652
The man you placed
in my kitchen.

39:53.695 --> 39:54.914
Roy.

39:54.957 --> 39:56.350
You told me

39:56.394 --> 39:59.832
that he had experience
as a short-order cook.

39:59.875 --> 40:02.530
Two years at McDonald's
in college.

40:02.574 --> 40:04.532
He's not there
just to make French fries.

40:04.576 --> 40:06.491
I need guys in close.

40:08.623 --> 40:10.973
He's not up to
Pollos standards.

40:12.627 --> 40:15.500
I'll find
a replacement.

40:15.543 --> 40:17.632
We're stretched thin.

40:17.676 --> 40:21.593
I've got guys working
18-hour days all over town.

40:21.636 --> 40:24.422
Two weeks.
We haven't had a tickle.

40:24.465 --> 40:26.206
And?

40:26.249 --> 40:27.555
All due respect,

40:27.599 --> 40:30.776
the rest of the world thinks
the guy is dead.

40:32.778 --> 40:36.782
Lalo Salamanca is alive.

40:40.916 --> 40:42.440
Then where is he?

41:02.111 --> 41:04.244
Hey.

41:04.287 --> 41:06.028
Hey.

41:06.072 --> 41:07.203
How was your day?

41:07.247 --> 41:09.205
Uh,
what are we doing here?

41:09.249 --> 41:11.381
Take a look.
What do you think?

41:12.687 --> 41:15.081
About what?

41:15.124 --> 41:17.692
My new office.
Potentially.

41:17.736 --> 41:20.434
Come on.

41:31.706 --> 41:33.621
Huh.

41:33.665 --> 41:36.406
Mrs. Nguyen kicked me
to the curb.

41:36.450 --> 41:38.408
What? Why?

41:38.452 --> 41:40.889
It's a long story,
but upshot is

41:40.933 --> 41:44.806
she wants me outta there
with extreme prejudice.

41:45.807 --> 41:47.983
Wow.

41:48.027 --> 41:49.332
Bad day, huh?

41:50.943 --> 41:53.728
No.
It was a great day.

41:53.772 --> 41:56.644
With actual
paying clients.

41:56.688 --> 41:57.906
The word is out!

41:57.950 --> 41:59.908
People are throwing
cash retainers at me --

41:59.952 --> 42:02.868
just to say
Saul Goodman is their lawyer.

42:04.522 --> 42:06.524
Because of
who you represented.

42:08.351 --> 42:10.702
Well, I mean,
that's part of it.

42:10.745 --> 42:12.704
But, um,
the bottom line is

42:12.747 --> 42:16.316
I need a new place
to do business -- pronto.

42:16.359 --> 42:17.883
Now, this place
is a shithole,

42:17.926 --> 42:19.754
but the price is right

42:19.798 --> 42:22.583
and I think I can talk the
landlord into a month-to-month.

42:22.627 --> 42:26.718
So it's temporary, you know,
'til I find something better.

42:30.548 --> 42:32.767
Hey.

42:32.811 --> 42:34.464
What do you think?

42:40.732 --> 42:43.691
It's small.

42:43.735 --> 42:46.215
It's...dirty.

42:47.390 --> 42:50.002
And this whole place
smells funny.

42:53.440 --> 42:56.704
But the courthouse
is five blocks away.

42:56.748 --> 43:00.316
You can't get to MDC
without driving past.

43:00.360 --> 43:02.841
Parking is good,
bail bond row isn't far,

43:02.884 --> 43:06.148
and, uh...

43:06.192 --> 43:08.586
Taco Cabeza is just around
the corner.

43:10.196 --> 43:12.372
Might be a diamond
in the rough.

43:16.028 --> 43:18.378
Just promise me...

43:19.814 --> 43:21.903
...you won't move
the toilet.

43:25.733 --> 43:28.388
There it is.
Alright.

43:28.431 --> 43:31.609
Um, speaking of
the Taco Cabeza...

43:31.652 --> 43:34.568
I'm starving.
Let's do it.

43:55.067 --> 43:56.851
On the next episode
of "Better Call Saul..."

43:56.895 --> 43:58.418
Thank God he's dead.

43:58.461 --> 44:00.246
I can put more guys
on the place

44:00.289 --> 44:01.856
if that's what
you're thinking.

44:01.900 --> 44:03.466
Open for business.

44:03.510 --> 44:06.034
What you're doing to help the
little guy, it's incredible.

44:06.078 --> 44:07.470
I'm just getting started.

44:07.514 --> 44:10.038
I just need you
to know that I know.

44:10.082 --> 44:11.213
It wasn't me, Cliff.

44:11.257 --> 44:13.433
Sounds like money.
Okay. Great.

44:16.784 --> 44:19.178
Who is this Saul Goodman?
You?

44:19.221 --> 44:20.440
You got it.
