00:09.488 --> 00:12.098
[Sighs] Remind me, why am I doing this?

00:12.137 --> 00:14.024
Because I saved your ass in Marrakesh.

00:14.126 --> 00:16.193
Uh, I let you save my ass, old man,

00:16.228 --> 00:18.162
so that you could impress
little miss naughty-knickers,

00:18.197 --> 00:19.264
who you had a crush on.

00:19.298 --> 00:20.532
[Both laugh]

00:20.566 --> 00:21.666
You know, for a couple of ex-spies,

00:21.700 --> 00:23.902
you sound a lot like sorority
girls at spring break.

00:23.936 --> 00:27.005
Hayley, this is Marcus.
He's going in with you.

00:27.039 --> 00:28.439
Bryce told me you were a badass,

00:28.474 --> 00:31.676
but he didn't say you
were an X-rated fantasy.

00:32.234 --> 00:34.612
It's very hard to focus
on how charming you are

00:34.647 --> 00:38.381
when your breath smells
like a festival toilet.

00:40.219 --> 00:41.753
Please tell me he's a better sneak

00:41.787 --> 00:43.555
than he is a pickup artist.

00:43.589 --> 00:45.723
A simple job. 20 minutes tops.

00:45.758 --> 00:46.758
My client is married

00:46.792 --> 00:49.727
to the VP of Manchester
Energy International...

00:49.762 --> 00:50.728
Paul Halston.

00:50.763 --> 00:52.597
She's convinced he's cheating.

00:52.631 --> 00:55.900
So,
Marcus will bypass building security,

00:55.935 --> 00:59.533
while Hayley puts spyware
on his office computer.

01:00.074 --> 01:02.607
All right. Let's do this.

01:02.641 --> 01:04.042
Thanks again. I owe you.

01:04.075 --> 01:05.143
Yes, you do.

[Computer beeping]

01:35.874 --> 01:38.009
What kind of spyware is this?

01:38.043 --> 01:39.777
It's taking forever to upload.

01:41.513 --> 01:43.314
[Door opens]

01:43.349 --> 01:46.017
Shh! This is my office.

01:46.051 --> 01:48.653
It's so fancy. Oh, my goodness.

01:48.687 --> 01:49.487
[Laughing]

01:49.521 --> 01:51.789
Look at that. That's where I sit.

01:51.824 --> 01:53.124
Mm.

01:53.158 --> 01:54.092
Oh!

01:54.126 --> 01:56.160
Ah. [Laughs]

01:56.195 --> 01:59.097
Talk about a breach of security.

01:59.131 --> 02:01.199
I'd like to breach hers,
that's for sure.

02:01.233 --> 02:02.667
You cannot.

02:02.701 --> 02:04.035
Yes, I can.

[Computer beeping]

02:07.906 --> 02:09.273

Oh, wow. That's so cool.

02:13.846 --> 02:15.546
I guess it's only fair, right?

02:15.581 --> 02:16.881
You gonna show me?
[Laughs]

02:16.915 --> 02:18.483
She's way out of his league.

02:18.517 --> 02:19.784
And yours, by the way.

02:19.818 --> 02:20.818
[Scoffs]

02:20.853 --> 02:23.054
- Hmm?
- Uh...

02:23.088 --> 02:25.890
Is this nice? Whoop!

02:25.924 --> 02:27.692
10 bucks he can't even figure out

02:27.726 --> 02:28.860
how to get that thing off.

02:28.894 --> 02:29.894
Pass.

02:29.928 --> 02:30.695
[Laughs]

Oh, ooh. [Laughing] It's okay.

[Both laughing]

02:39.838 --> 02:41.639
- All right. Here, let's go.
- Hold on.

02:41.674 --> 02:43.708
They're just getting to the good part.

02:43.809 --> 02:46.678
Uh...
[Laughs]

02:49.848 --> 02:51.364
I'm leaving.

03:11.036 --> 03:12.870
You're up early. Sleep okay?

03:12.905 --> 03:13.871
No, no, no, no.

03:13.906 --> 03:14.939
No. [Chuckles]

03:14.973 --> 03:16.507
Oh, did I snore?

03:16.542 --> 03:17.709
Yeah, but that's not the problem.

03:17.743 --> 03:18.676
What was?

03:18.711 --> 03:20.111
You betrayed me.

03:20.145 --> 03:22.280
What? How? When?

03:22.314 --> 03:24.849
Last night, in my dreams.

03:24.883 --> 03:27.218
[Chuckling]

03:29.054 --> 03:31.556
But that's... I-I...
What's, uh... How...

03:31.590 --> 03:34.125
What could I have possibly
done that was so wrong?

03:34.159 --> 03:35.293
You know what? Never mind.

03:35.327 --> 03:36.961
I-I don't even want to relive it.

03:36.995 --> 03:39.397
Well, technically, you didn't live it.
You just dreamed it.

03:40.933 --> 03:42.867
That's... But I... [Cellphone rings]

03:42.901 --> 03:45.069
Whatever I did, I am so sorry.

03:45.104 --> 03:46.070
It's the precinct.

03:46.105 --> 03:48.039
Why do I feel like a
murder just saved my life?

03:48.073 --> 03:48.973
[Cellphone beeps]

03:49.007 --> 03:50.074
Beckett.

03:50.109 --> 03:52.243
Martha: Okay, ladies, I have decided

03:52.277 --> 03:55.113
that I should change my autograph.

03:55.147 --> 03:58.850
So... what do you think?

03:59.918 --> 04:02.754
Gram, that looks exactly
like your usual autograph.

04:03.956 --> 04:05.423
No, no, no, no, no.

04:05.457 --> 04:09.927
My usual autograph,
when I am merely an actress,

04:09.962 --> 04:14.799
is like this, sort of carefree and...
and whimsical,

04:14.833 --> 04:18.836
whereas the other conveys insight,
wisdom.

04:18.870 --> 04:20.772
They're completely different.
Can't you see that?

04:21.940 --> 04:22.974
- Insight.
- Wisdom.

04:23.008 --> 04:24.442
- Sure.
- Yes, absolutely.

04:24.476 --> 04:25.042
Good job.

04:25.077 --> 04:26.344
Now, if you'll excuse me,

04:26.378 --> 04:27.478
I have a business to run,

04:27.513 --> 04:29.914
especially since you-know-who
is completely useless.

04:29.948 --> 04:30.915
I heard that.

04:30.949 --> 04:33.417
And if I'm so useless,
why would Beckett ask me

04:33.452 --> 04:34.919
to consult on a murder?

04:34.953 --> 04:36.788
- Oh, Mother, new autograph.
- Yeah.

04:36.822 --> 04:38.823
Nice. Conveys wisdom, insight.

04:38.857 --> 04:40.024
I like it. [Keys rattle]

04:40.058 --> 04:41.058
All right, I just need my car keys,

04:41.093 --> 04:43.294
and I'm off to the
Manchester Energy building.

04:43.328 --> 04:45.463
Wait, murder at Manchester Energy?

04:45.497 --> 04:46.531
Who's the victim?

04:46.565 --> 04:48.266
All they said was "dead male."

04:48.300 --> 04:51.702
Ah. You know, Rick,
I have never seen you in action

04:51.737 --> 04:52.837
at an NYPD crime scene.

04:52.871 --> 04:54.605
Well, perhaps you'd like to tag along

04:54.640 --> 04:56.307
and watch the crime-scene
Jedi master at work.

04:56.341 --> 04:59.177
Please tell me you do not
refer to yourself as that.

04:59.211 --> 05:00.645
Do you really?

05:00.679 --> 05:02.380
Perhaps you should come
watch another time.

05:02.414 --> 05:04.782
No, no, no. Lead on, Castle Wan Kenobi.

05:04.817 --> 05:05.950
You are my only hope.

05:05.984 --> 05:07.952
I like that, but save it.

05:07.986 --> 05:08.986
Say it in front of the guys.

05:09.021 --> 05:11.189
[Siren wailing in distance]

05:11.223 --> 05:12.957
[Indistinct conversation]

05:12.991 --> 05:14.192
Esposito: Hayley, what happened?

05:14.226 --> 05:15.660
Did you lose a bet, and now Castle gets

05:15.694 --> 05:16.661
to drag you everywhere he goes?

05:16.695 --> 05:18.729
[Laughs sarcastically]
Quite the contrary.

05:18.764 --> 05:22.066
Hayley actually wanted to watch
me solve yet another murder.

05:22.100 --> 05:24.969
You mean <i>help</i> solve. You... help.

05:25.003 --> 05:27.905
Yeah, remember, bro,
you cannot solve a homicide without us.

05:27.940 --> 05:29.841
While we sure as hell can
solve one without you.

05:29.875 --> 05:31.576
Really? Because on the ride over here,

05:31.610 --> 05:34.378
Rick was bragging about how
the NYPD can't close a case.

05:34.413 --> 05:36.147
Eh, t-those were just jokes that...

05:36.181 --> 05:38.082
Out of context, it's not as funny.

05:38.116 --> 05:39.917
I was rolling my eyes when I said it.

05:39.952 --> 05:41.853
Thank you for stabbing me in the back.

05:41.887 --> 05:43.821
You weren't the only one.

05:43.856 --> 05:45.022
Our victim took his

05:45.057 --> 05:47.992
right between his T4 and T5 vertebrae.

05:48.026 --> 05:51.062
Severed his spinal cord. Died instantly.

05:51.096 --> 05:53.531
I'm guessing from his outfit,
he wasn't an employee?

05:53.565 --> 05:54.866
Esposito:
Most likely some kind of thief.

05:54.900 --> 05:55.666
Ryan: Pretty good one at that.

05:55.701 --> 05:57.235
None of the security was tripped.

05:57.269 --> 05:58.703
All the cameras were shut down.

05:58.737 --> 06:00.037
Castle: Was anything stolen?

06:00.072 --> 06:01.105
What's there to steal?

06:01.139 --> 06:03.541
I mean, this is an
energy-company office building.

06:03.575 --> 06:06.077
The only thing of value are the
furniture and the computers.

06:06.111 --> 06:07.345
May I?

06:07.379 --> 06:08.946
Esposito: Clearly, we're helpless.

06:08.981 --> 06:11.916
So, come on, Castle, please,
solve this case for us.

06:11.950 --> 06:14.719
Castle: Well,
the only thing we know for sure is...

06:14.753 --> 06:16.087
He was killed at 3:27 a.m.

06:16.121 --> 06:17.922
Very good, Hayley.

06:17.956 --> 06:19.290
Whoa, wait. What? How did you know that?

06:19.324 --> 06:20.258
Broken watch.

06:20.292 --> 06:22.059
He must have busted it
when he hit the ground.

06:22.094 --> 06:23.427
Ryan: Esposito, we have Hayley.

06:23.462 --> 06:24.762
- What do we need Castle for?
- Yeah.

06:24.796 --> 06:25.863
Castle: Super funny, guys.

06:25.898 --> 06:29.033
That was lucky,
and I can still help I.D. this victim,

06:29.067 --> 06:30.134
thank you very much.

06:30.168 --> 06:31.969
Lanie, run a fingerprint scan.

06:32.004 --> 06:33.271
Lanie: Okay, look, Castle,

06:33.305 --> 06:34.805
I don't know what all of this is about,

06:34.840 --> 06:36.307
but I don't tell you
how to write your books,

06:36.341 --> 06:38.209
so don't tell me how to I.D. a body.

06:38.243 --> 06:40.111
I've already performed a scan.

06:40.145 --> 06:43.047
I'm just waiting for the results.

06:43.081 --> 06:45.549
[Camera shutter clicks]

06:45.584 --> 06:48.586
Uh, do you think it's possible
to identify the victim

06:48.620 --> 06:49.954
from the purchase of these mints?

06:49.988 --> 06:51.122
I guess we could.

06:51.156 --> 06:52.957
It's far more efficient to
use a fingerprint scanner.

06:52.991 --> 06:55.426
[Gasps] Oh! Oh!

06:55.460 --> 06:57.428
I-I just bolloxed up
a piece of evidence.

06:57.462 --> 06:59.497
- I'm so sorry.
- Rookie move, right?

06:59.531 --> 07:02.066
Because you've never touched
anything at a crime scene.

07:02.100 --> 07:05.002
Make note that this is
contaminated with Hayley's prints.

07:05.037 --> 07:06.437
So sorry.

07:06.471 --> 07:07.471
[Computer beeps]

07:07.506 --> 07:10.775
Oh, here we go.
We got an I.D. on our victim.

07:10.809 --> 07:13.811
His name is Marcus Janek.

07:13.845 --> 07:17.181
He's, uh, yeah... A second-story man

07:17.215 --> 07:18.416
with a history of priors.

07:18.450 --> 07:20.818
Looks like somebody caught
Marcus in the act and killed him.

07:20.852 --> 07:22.019
Or perhaps Marcus had a partner.

07:22.054 --> 07:23.154
Partner?

07:23.188 --> 07:26.123
Well, Marcus is a burglar.
He would be on high alert.

07:26.158 --> 07:27.158
The only reason he'd
let someone behind him

07:27.192 --> 07:30.461
is if he trusted that person,
I.E. a partner.

07:30.495 --> 07:32.041
We find the person Marcus
broke in here with,

07:32.120 --> 07:32.831
we find his killer.

07:32.865 --> 07:34.132
Ryan: Very good, Castle.

07:34.166 --> 07:35.834
Esposito: Yeah,
that makes a lot of sense.

07:35.868 --> 07:37.836
Why are you acting surprised?

07:38.838 --> 07:40.672
I don't know if it's important at all,

07:40.706 --> 07:42.640
but all those chairs are tucked in,
except for that one.

07:42.675 --> 07:44.108
Except for that one there.

07:44.143 --> 07:45.643
Yep, I noticed that, too.

07:45.678 --> 07:47.545
On the way in, way before she did.

07:47.580 --> 07:49.914
So, Ned Werner.

07:50.983 --> 07:52.550
Perhaps Ned was working late last night.

07:52.585 --> 07:53.551
Maybe he saw something,

07:53.586 --> 07:57.655
or maybe he's Marcus' partner,
an inside man.

07:57.690 --> 07:59.357
Please, Detective Ryan.

07:59.391 --> 08:01.392
Thank you, <i>Detective</i> Esposito.

08:06.665 --> 08:08.500
Bryce, Marcus is dead.

08:08.534 --> 08:09.534
What the hell is going on?

08:09.568 --> 08:11.402
Does this have anything
to do with your client?

08:11.437 --> 08:12.704
Hayley, I'm sorry.

08:12.738 --> 08:14.973
I lied about everything.

08:15.007 --> 08:17.842
There is no cheating husband,
nor an angry wife.

08:17.877 --> 08:18.977
What?

08:19.011 --> 08:20.211
[Sighs] How could you be so...

08:20.246 --> 08:21.746
I had no choice.

08:21.780 --> 08:24.415
Why? Who put you up to this?

08:24.450 --> 08:26.751
It doesn't matter. Not anymore.

08:26.785 --> 08:31.256
All you need to know is Code 44.

08:31.290 --> 08:34.558
I'm sorry, Hayley. I'm so sorry.

08:34.592 --> 08:35.493
[Telephone clicks]

08:35.528 --> 08:39.030
Hey, Hayley,
the guys are thinking that...

08:39.063 --> 08:40.532
- Everything okay?
- Uh, no.

08:40.566 --> 08:42.100
A friend of mine's fallen ill,

08:42.134 --> 08:44.769
and, um, I've got to swing by, check in.

08:44.803 --> 08:46.337

09:37.409 --> 09:39.179
[Sighs] Damn it, Alexis.
What are you doing here?!

09:39.276 --> 09:40.477
Well, I needed some case files for work.

09:40.511 --> 09:42.644
But if this is how you get when
people come over unannounced,

09:42.749 --> 09:45.071
I am happy to give you
back your spare key.

09:45.414 --> 09:46.416
Come on.

09:48.369 --> 09:49.986
[Sighs]

09:50.321 --> 09:52.755
So, uh, redecorating?

09:52.790 --> 09:54.924
You need to leave now.

09:54.959 --> 09:55.725
I see what's going on.

09:55.759 --> 09:57.894
You've got your go-bag, your guns.

09:57.928 --> 10:00.563
Is this why you wanted to
go by that crime scene?

10:00.597 --> 10:02.432
Hayley, if you're in trouble,
talk to me.

10:02.466 --> 10:04.567
I can't. It's not safe.

10:05.669 --> 10:08.938
Okay, look,
I did a favor for a friend last night...

10:08.973 --> 10:10.740
At least, I <i>thought</i> he was a friend.

10:10.774 --> 10:12.875
It was meant to be a quick P.I. job,

10:12.910 --> 10:14.877
but technically, I broke a few laws.

10:14.912 --> 10:16.379
Okay, well, tell Beckett. Tell my dad.

10:16.413 --> 10:19.782
- They can help.
- No, they can't.

10:19.817 --> 10:22.418
The friend I was working with...
We were in MI6 together.

10:22.453 --> 10:23.586
He just phoned.

10:23.620 --> 10:25.788
It turns out that the job wasn't legit.

10:25.823 --> 10:27.790
Something bigger is going on,

10:27.825 --> 10:30.560
something bad enough that
he told me to go Code 44.

10:30.594 --> 10:32.762
Uh, what does Code 44 mean?

10:32.796 --> 10:34.664
It means abandon
everything and everyone.

10:34.698 --> 10:37.066
It means run for your
life and don't look back.

10:37.101 --> 10:37.834
You can't do that.

10:37.868 --> 10:40.269
- I have no choice.
- Yes, you do.

10:40.304 --> 10:42.338
After years of floating
from one place to the next,

10:42.373 --> 10:43.840
you've finally found a real home here.

10:43.874 --> 10:47.374
And I might be putting you
and it in danger by staying.

10:47.444 --> 10:48.611
I have to go now.

10:48.646 --> 10:51.214
No, you have to stay and fight,

10:51.248 --> 10:53.583
figure out what's really
going on here and fix it.

10:56.453 --> 10:59.355
Please at least try.

11:03.146 --> 11:05.495
Ah. Hello, gentlemen.

11:05.529 --> 11:06.696
Ooh.

11:06.730 --> 11:10.733
Castle, you shouldn't show your
face around here right now.

11:10.768 --> 11:12.902
Yeah. Beckett's pissed.

11:12.937 --> 11:15.305
Uh, guys, it was a dream.

11:15.339 --> 11:18.107
Well, dreams are doorways
to the subconscious, Castle.

11:18.142 --> 11:20.777
Yeah.
And what you did was just so... Mm.

11:20.811 --> 11:21.644
Wrong.

11:21.679 --> 11:22.478
She told you what I did? What did I do?

11:22.513 --> 11:24.781
Well, we're sworn to secrecy, bro.

11:24.815 --> 11:27.650
Yeah. Unlike some,
we would never do that to Beckett.

11:27.685 --> 11:29.452
[Scoffs] It was a dream.

11:29.486 --> 11:31.087
Well, dream or not,
you did something in real life,

11:31.121 --> 11:32.655
and Beckett's subconscious
is picking up on it.

11:32.690 --> 11:34.757
You need to figure out what that was

11:34.792 --> 11:37.527
and come clean before it's too late.

11:37.561 --> 11:38.795
Uh... [Elevator bell dings]

11:38.829 --> 11:40.563
- Here's Ned.
- Let's go.

11:44.668 --> 11:46.636
Hey. How's your friend doing?

11:46.670 --> 11:49.372
Hmm? Oh, uh, much better, thanks.

11:49.406 --> 11:51.207
You know, my curiosity's been piqued.

11:51.242 --> 11:52.375
Can we watch his interview?

11:52.409 --> 11:54.210
Oh, sure. Just wait till...

11:54.245 --> 11:56.012
[Door closes] Okay, go.

11:56.046 --> 11:57.947
So, Mr. Werner, tell us where you were

11:57.982 --> 11:59.983
between 3:00 and 4:00 a.m. this morning.

12:00.017 --> 12:02.886
Home. Alone, asleep.

12:02.920 --> 12:05.455
Well, that's weird, Ned,
because your office computer

12:05.489 --> 12:08.024
says that you logged in at 3:02 a.m.,

12:08.058 --> 12:10.793
just minutes before the murder.

12:10.828 --> 12:11.895
Oh, wait. Yeah, no. Yes, yes.

12:11.929 --> 12:14.297
I was, uh...
Now that you mention it, yes, I did.

12:14.331 --> 12:15.999
I-I popped into the office for a bit,

12:16.033 --> 12:17.333
just to do some work.

12:17.368 --> 12:18.701
I did not see him there.

12:18.736 --> 12:19.903
Esposito:
So you were in the office alone?

12:19.937 --> 12:21.504
Yeah, completely alone.

12:21.538 --> 12:24.540
You lying, little bastard.

12:24.575 --> 12:26.676
What makes you think he's
lying about being alone?

12:28.679 --> 12:29.846
Look at his neck.

12:29.880 --> 12:33.416
See that tiny love bite? It's new.

12:33.450 --> 12:36.753
So if Ned was alone last night,
who gave him that?

12:36.787 --> 12:37.854
Esposito: Are you lying to us, Ned?

12:37.888 --> 12:39.722
No. No, I would not lie.

12:39.757 --> 12:40.890
Never. No, no.

12:40.925 --> 12:41.991
You lied about not being there.

12:42.026 --> 12:42.759
No, I didn't. I didn't lie.

12:42.793 --> 12:44.727
I just forgot. Oh, you forgot?

12:44.762 --> 12:45.995
So maybe there's
something else you forgot.

12:46.030 --> 12:47.730
Maybe you forgot that Marcus was
your partner and you let him in.

12:47.765 --> 12:49.165
- And you forgot that you killed him.
- Mm-hmm.

12:49.199 --> 12:50.266
No. [Sighs]

12:50.301 --> 12:51.267
- So you remember killing him?
- Yes.

12:51.302 --> 12:53.069
- That's perfect. Wait!
- No, no, no, no, no!

12:53.103 --> 12:55.071
Yes, yes, yes, I didn't forget,

12:55.105 --> 12:56.339
because, no, I didn't kill him.

12:56.373 --> 12:58.241
[Sighs] Look, I don't know this man.

12:58.275 --> 12:59.776
I've never seen him before in my life,

12:59.810 --> 13:01.010
so I couldn't have killed him.

13:01.045 --> 13:04.347
So, your office computer says
you logged out at 3:10 a.m.

13:04.381 --> 13:06.182
He was killed at 3:27 a.m.

13:06.216 --> 13:07.383
Actually, you could have killed him.

13:07.418 --> 13:08.551
[Winches] Yeah.

13:08.585 --> 13:10.353
- Wait. 3:27?
- Mm-hmm.

13:10.387 --> 13:12.922
No, no, no. I could not have killed him,

13:12.957 --> 13:14.791
because I was in a Hytch ride by then.

13:14.825 --> 13:18.428
See? Driver picked me up at 3:19 a.m.

13:24.268 --> 13:27.470
Hello, Neddie.
Let's have a chat, shall we?

13:27.504 --> 13:29.205
Are you a cop?

13:29.239 --> 13:31.365
The other detective
said I was free to go!

13:32.843 --> 13:34.043
Not quite.

13:34.078 --> 13:36.713
Ow, ow!

13:36.747 --> 13:37.747
[Screams]

13:37.781 --> 13:39.215
[Toilet flushes]

13:39.249 --> 13:41.584
[Indistinct shouting]

13:41.618 --> 13:43.920
Okay, okay, okay!

13:43.954 --> 13:46.222
Yes, yes, I will. Yes!

13:46.256 --> 13:48.558
What the hell is going on in here?

13:48.592 --> 13:51.527
Well, this gentleman would
like to revise his statement.

13:52.666 --> 13:54.998
Yes, I'd like to revise my statement.

13:55.032 --> 13:58.735
I was not alone in my office.

13:58.769 --> 14:00.903
Uh, about 2:00 a.m., in a bar,

14:00.938 --> 14:04.507
I met a smoking-hot blond chick.

14:04.541 --> 14:06.275
[Clears throat]

14:06.310 --> 14:09.012
Who... She's a very lovely
young lady named Karla,

14:09.046 --> 14:12.515
and we hit it off,
so I took her back to my office.

14:12.549 --> 14:13.983
So, why did you lie to my detectives?

14:14.018 --> 14:15.952
Hayley:
Because a security breach like this

14:15.986 --> 14:17.754
could get nasty Ned here fired.

14:17.788 --> 14:21.991
Go on,
tell the nice captain what you did.

14:22.026 --> 14:23.826
I was trying to impress Karla,

14:23.861 --> 14:26.529
so I...

14:26.563 --> 14:28.931
I logged into the
company's closed server,

14:28.966 --> 14:32.135
and I shut down the power at
10 Downing Street for a second.

14:33.670 --> 14:35.138
It didn't work, though.

14:35.172 --> 14:36.439
We didn't have sex or nothing.

14:36.473 --> 14:38.107
Wow [Scoffs] shocking.

14:38.142 --> 14:40.209
No. She was very frisky with me.

14:40.244 --> 14:41.144
And, then, all of a sudden,

14:41.178 --> 14:43.179
she said she was bored,
wanted to go home.

14:43.213 --> 14:45.014
Why?

14:45.049 --> 14:46.315
I think maybe it was because

14:46.350 --> 14:48.985
I was having trouble undoing her corset.

14:49.019 --> 14:51.788
In my defense, it was,
like, crazy-complicated,

14:51.822 --> 14:53.556
and... and... and I was... I was...

14:53.590 --> 14:54.824
[Clears throat] I was very nervous.

14:54.858 --> 14:58.494
So after you logged on to your
computer is when Karla left you?

14:58.529 --> 14:59.962
Yes. And as far as I know,

14:59.997 --> 15:01.898
the office was completely
empty when I left.

15:01.932 --> 15:04.867
Did you actually see
Karla leave the building?

15:06.070 --> 15:07.170
N-No.

15:07.204 --> 15:10.807
So it's possible she hid and
then waited until you left?

15:16.180 --> 15:19.515
Hey, Ryan,
Ned here wants to revise his statement.

15:19.550 --> 15:21.317
Awesome. Had a little accident?

15:21.351 --> 15:22.852
Don't touch anything, please.

15:22.886 --> 15:24.353
Uh, excuse me, Hayley.

15:24.388 --> 15:25.922
Where are you going?

15:25.956 --> 15:28.658
Hey, guys. Is there a problem here?

15:28.692 --> 15:30.526
Hayley waterboarded Ned.

15:30.561 --> 15:32.328
I did no such thing.
It was more of a swirly.

15:32.362 --> 15:33.429
[Sighs] Never mind.

15:33.464 --> 15:35.598
Look, apparently, Ned was tricked

15:35.632 --> 15:37.033
by some woman named Karla

15:37.067 --> 15:39.335
into gaining access to the building

15:39.369 --> 15:40.236
and the secured server,

15:40.270 --> 15:42.189
most likely to help
Marcus rob the place.

15:42.239 --> 15:43.740
Yeah, but clearly something happened

15:43.774 --> 15:45.174
between Marcus and Karla,

15:45.209 --> 15:46.576
because it looks like she's the one

15:46.610 --> 15:47.744
that drove that knife into his back.

15:47.778 --> 15:49.312
And is that all?

15:49.346 --> 15:50.513
Why are you asking me?

15:50.547 --> 15:53.583
Because clearly something is
going on with you, Hayley...

15:53.617 --> 15:56.185
Something connected to this case.

15:56.220 --> 15:58.105
You know, you can tell us.

16:01.425 --> 16:04.327
I was in that office last night.

16:04.361 --> 16:06.445
Okay, we need to talk now.

16:09.934 --> 16:12.402
Really? You want to talk in here?

16:12.436 --> 16:13.503
[Chuckles] Yes.

16:13.537 --> 16:17.240
This is where we question
all of our murder suspects.

16:17.274 --> 16:19.208
You think I killed Marcus.

16:19.243 --> 16:21.544
Right now, I don't know what to think.

16:23.213 --> 16:25.048
[Sighs]

16:25.082 --> 16:27.951
An old friend of mine from MI6,
Bryce Roberts,

16:27.985 --> 16:30.019
hired me and Marcus
to do some P.I. work,

16:30.054 --> 16:32.088
to install some spy software

16:32.122 --> 16:34.223
on the VP of Manchester
Energy's computer.

16:34.258 --> 16:35.391
At least,
that's what I thought we were doing.

16:35.426 --> 16:38.127
Right in the middle of it all,
in walked Ned and Karla,

16:38.162 --> 16:40.697
so I finished my part of the job,
and I took off.

16:40.731 --> 16:43.299
Marcus stayed to watch
Ned and Karla go at it.

16:43.334 --> 16:45.568
[Scoffs] Must have been
part of their plan.

16:45.602 --> 16:48.237
Wait a minute. Marcus and Karla
were partners? Must have been.

16:48.272 --> 16:50.540
Although what they were really
after and why she killed him,

16:50.574 --> 16:52.942
I have no bloody idea.

16:52.977 --> 16:55.445
Okay. Tell me about Bryce.

16:55.479 --> 16:58.281
He was my team leader back
when I freelanced for MI6.

16:58.315 --> 16:59.449
Were you guys close?

16:59.483 --> 17:00.917
Yeah, for a while.

17:00.951 --> 17:02.952
Then everything went to hell in an op,

17:02.987 --> 17:04.287
and I cut all ties with MI6.

17:04.320 --> 17:05.989
Then, a few months ago,

17:06.022 --> 17:07.723
he retired from Her Majesty's service,

17:07.758 --> 17:10.460
started a freelance security
company here in New York.

17:10.493 --> 17:11.861
He got back in touch.

17:13.998 --> 17:15.231
He's a good man.

17:15.265 --> 17:17.099
So, why did he involve you?

17:17.134 --> 17:19.167
Yeah, I'd like to ask him that myself.

17:19.203 --> 17:21.604
Any idea where we can find him?

17:26.042 --> 17:27.944
Are you sure Bryce's
ex-wife still lives here?

17:27.978 --> 17:28.711
Hayley: I hope so.

17:28.746 --> 17:30.113
He would have come to say goodbye

17:30.147 --> 17:31.447
before he went Code 44.

17:31.482 --> 17:32.982
There's no cars here.

17:33.017 --> 17:34.917
It doesn't look like anybody's...
[Man screams]

17:37.688 --> 17:38.721
Police!

17:40.157 --> 17:41.290
Esposito: How bad?

17:41.325 --> 17:42.325
Ryan: We got a body here.

17:42.359 --> 17:43.993
- All right.
- Bryce?

17:45.729 --> 17:47.130
Bryce?

17:56.744 --> 17:59.387
Stabbed in the back, just like Marcus.

17:59.769 --> 18:02.218
Right between the T4 and T5 vertebrae.

18:02.415 --> 18:04.474
I don't believe it's coincidence.

18:04.777 --> 18:06.251
I'm sorry about your friend.

18:06.286 --> 18:07.186
Thanks.

18:09.289 --> 18:12.291
You know,
you can't blame yourself for this.

18:12.325 --> 18:13.759
Bryce lied. He chose to trick you.

18:13.793 --> 18:16.462
Bryce was leveraged, compromised.

18:16.496 --> 18:18.263
Yeah, but by whom?
[Sighs]

18:18.298 --> 18:20.580
Hey,
what are they getting you mixed up in?

18:20.752 --> 18:23.435
Yo, some unis are
canvassing the neighborhood,

18:23.470 --> 18:24.987
but there's no trace of our suspect.

18:25.066 --> 18:26.068
It had to be Karla.

18:26.134 --> 18:27.506
Ryan: Could be
she's cleaning up loose ends.

18:27.540 --> 18:28.340
I mean, her partners are dead.

18:28.375 --> 18:29.742
All Karla has to do now is disappear.

18:29.776 --> 18:31.009
Why would she... [Cellphone dings]

18:31.044 --> 18:32.678
break into Manchester Energy
building in the first place?

18:32.712 --> 18:33.746
What were they after?

18:33.780 --> 18:35.814
And why do they need
Hayley to be a part of it?

18:35.849 --> 18:37.182
Wait. Hang on.

18:37.217 --> 18:40.319
$10 million was just
wired into my bank account

18:40.353 --> 18:41.320
from Manchester Energy.

18:41.354 --> 18:43.355
What the hell is going on?

18:43.390 --> 18:45.476
I think I know why they needed you,
Hayley.

18:45.595 --> 18:46.848
Why?

18:47.827 --> 18:49.495
You're the patsy.

18:52.198 --> 18:53.232
Reporter: <i>We are getting confirmation</i>

18:53.266 --> 18:56.034
<i>that the massive blackout
that has hit London</i>

18:56.069 --> 18:58.137
<i>is due to a cyber attack</i>

18:58.171 --> 19:00.706
<i>on Manchester Energy International,</i>

19:00.740 --> 19:02.374
<i>an electric and gas company</i>

19:02.409 --> 19:05.511
<i>with offices in Europe
and in the United States.</i>

19:05.545 --> 19:06.945
The money in your account is the noose

19:06.980 --> 19:09.548
that hangs the cyber
attack around your neck.

19:09.582 --> 19:10.783
<i>It may take weeks before</i>

19:10.817 --> 19:14.219
<i>they're able to restore full
power to the city's grid.</i>

19:14.254 --> 19:16.488
[Sighs] I just assumed that
Bryce was telling the truth.

19:16.523 --> 19:18.390
How could I have been so stupid?!

19:18.425 --> 19:19.625
It was a thumb drive Bryce gave you,
wasn't it?

19:19.659 --> 19:22.381
[Sighing] Oh, God.
I must have had a virus of some sort.

19:22.672 --> 19:24.696
So, I spoke with the FBI,

19:24.731 --> 19:27.466
and they are considering
this an act of terror.

19:29.035 --> 19:30.636
How bad's the damage?

19:30.670 --> 19:31.670
Uh, it's gonna be a few days

19:31.704 --> 19:34.673
before the power's back up in London,
maybe more.

19:34.707 --> 19:37.176
Fantastic. So I have
unwittingly plunged my hometown

19:37.210 --> 19:38.110
back into the 16th century.

19:38.144 --> 19:40.012
Castle: Oh,
that might not be all that bad.

19:40.046 --> 19:42.714
I mean,
<i>Hamlet</i> was written in the 16th century.

19:42.749 --> 19:43.649
I'm not helping.

19:44.137 --> 19:45.751
Kate,
do they know about my involvement yet?

19:45.785 --> 19:47.553
They traced the money to your account,

19:47.587 --> 19:50.094
and there is a warrant
out for your arrest.

19:50.890 --> 19:51.924
[Knock on door] Ryan: Excuse me.

19:51.958 --> 19:55.327
Hayley, uh, is this Karla?

19:55.361 --> 19:58.263
Oh, yes, with our old friend Ned.

19:58.298 --> 20:00.065
Well, the security camera
across the street caught them

20:00.099 --> 20:01.700
leaving this bar on
their way to the office.

20:01.734 --> 20:03.936
The bartender remembers Karla,

20:03.970 --> 20:05.737
but he'd never seen
her before that night,

20:05.772 --> 20:07.573
and unfortunately, Ned paid the bill.

20:07.607 --> 20:09.541
- So we have no way to track her.
- Well, we're scrubbing

20:09.576 --> 20:11.877
Bryce and Marcus'
computers and cellphones.

20:11.911 --> 20:13.745
One of them had to have
been in contact with her.

20:13.780 --> 20:15.165
Don't worry. We'll find her.

20:15.915 --> 20:17.416
Look, we'll keep you in the loop,

20:17.450 --> 20:19.551
but a police precinct is
probably <i>the</i> worst place

20:19.586 --> 20:20.586
to hide from the feds.

20:20.620 --> 20:22.187
Castle: Well,
we can go back to the P.I. office.

20:22.222 --> 20:24.089
You can stay out of
sight in the panic room

20:24.123 --> 20:24.990
until we clear your name.

20:25.024 --> 20:26.758
No. I can't let you guys cover for me.

20:26.793 --> 20:28.794
No, we got your back.

20:28.828 --> 20:30.168
Just go.

20:36.503 --> 20:37.998
So, how bad is it?

20:38.566 --> 20:41.273
She's gonna need a miracle
to stay out of jail.

20:48.038 --> 20:50.649
I wish I remembered
something about her...

20:50.683 --> 20:51.950
A tattoo, a scar.

20:51.985 --> 20:53.819
[Groans]

20:53.853 --> 20:55.621
You want a laugh?

20:55.655 --> 20:56.722
The only thing I recall about this woman

20:56.756 --> 20:59.691
is poor Ned fumbling around
with her fancy corset.

21:01.367 --> 21:03.729
Tell me more. Was it cotton or lace?

21:03.763 --> 21:04.663
Ew.

21:04.697 --> 21:05.764
Perv much?

21:05.798 --> 21:07.266
I'm serious.

21:07.300 --> 21:09.768
Okay, it was lace with black leather.
Why?

21:09.802 --> 21:11.603
Narrows it down. Padded?

21:11.638 --> 21:12.671
No.

21:12.705 --> 21:14.172
Back or front clasps?

21:14.207 --> 21:15.641
Back clasps and buckles,

21:15.675 --> 21:17.976
and it had a metal ring
in the front with snaps.

21:18.011 --> 21:19.678
Were there crystal studs
across the décolletage?

21:19.712 --> 21:21.079
Actually, yes.

21:21.114 --> 21:22.848
La Seductrice.

21:22.882 --> 21:26.652
Give me a moment to pull up
the 2016 Mon Cheri collection.

21:26.686 --> 21:27.753
[Keyboard clacks]

21:27.787 --> 21:28.854
That's it. That's the one.

21:28.888 --> 21:31.089
And voilÃ . My work here is done.

21:31.124 --> 21:33.825
Hey, Dad, uh, should I even ask?

21:33.860 --> 21:35.694
- "Nikki Heat" research.
- Yeah.

21:35.728 --> 21:38.096
Well, there's only one La
Seductrice in New York.

21:38.131 --> 21:39.998
I will e-mail this to Espo and Ryan,

21:40.033 --> 21:43.635
see if they can track her
down by her unmentionables.

21:43.670 --> 21:44.670
[Computer dings]

21:46.706 --> 21:48.206
[Sighing] Oh, damn it.

21:48.241 --> 21:50.099
I recognize him. He's MI6.

21:50.710 --> 21:53.946
I guess the FBI aren't the
only ones investigating.

21:53.980 --> 21:55.647
- You guys get in the panic room.
- Yeah.

21:57.817 --> 22:00.352
Hello, Mr. Castle.
The name's Stephen Mallory.

22:00.386 --> 22:02.454
Do you mean Agent Mallory, MI6?

22:02.488 --> 22:04.122
Well, I wonder how you knew that.

22:04.157 --> 22:06.158
Lucky guess. Do come in.

22:07.177 --> 22:08.961
Lovely decor.

22:08.995 --> 22:11.029
Retro but chic.

22:11.064 --> 22:11.897
Thank you.

22:11.931 --> 22:13.799
But I assume Her
Majesty's Secret Service

22:13.833 --> 22:16.001
isn't interested in
my interior designer.

22:16.035 --> 22:20.238
No. However, your business
partner interests us greatly.

22:20.273 --> 22:22.608
Ah, well, I haven't seen
Hayley since this morning.

22:25.742 --> 22:26.712
Mr. Castle,

22:26.746 --> 22:30.015
I must find Ms. Shipton
before it's too late,

22:30.049 --> 22:31.883
before I can no longer help her.

22:31.918 --> 22:33.685
Well, Hayley left MI6 for a reason.

22:33.720 --> 22:35.654
I doubt she needs your kind of help,
Agent Mallory.

22:35.688 --> 22:36.989
You may think you know Ms. Shipton,

22:37.023 --> 22:38.090
but, in fact, you do not.

22:38.124 --> 22:39.257
You could have fooled me.

22:39.292 --> 22:40.792
I'm sure she has.

22:42.228 --> 22:45.530
Tell me, did Ms. Shipton ever
tell you why she left MI6?

22:45.565 --> 22:48.734
Something about holiday
bonuses and bad fish and chips.

22:48.768 --> 22:49.835
Charming.

22:49.869 --> 22:51.503
Look, despite what you think,

22:51.537 --> 22:53.238
I can assure you Hayley was framed.

22:53.272 --> 22:56.508
And I can assure you she
is the main conspirator

22:56.542 --> 22:58.410
<i>in everything that happened today.</i>

22:58.444 --> 22:59.878
<i>How can you be so sure about that?</i>

22:59.912 --> 23:01.780
<i>I have access to her
confidential dossiers,</i>

23:01.814 --> 23:04.049
Mr. Castle.

23:04.083 --> 23:04.850
You must trust me...

23:04.884 --> 23:06.885
Ms. Shipton is intimately involved

23:06.919 --> 23:10.288
in the planning and the
execution of today's events.

23:10.323 --> 23:12.090
<i>We have proof.</i>

23:12.125 --> 23:13.625
Ignore him. Everything he's saying

23:13.660 --> 23:15.527
is classic counterintelligence.

23:15.561 --> 23:17.596
Ms. Shipton was arguably

23:17.630 --> 23:20.298
one of the most ruthless,
cold-hearted operatives

23:20.333 --> 23:21.633
in the history of MI6.

23:21.668 --> 23:24.469
Mm. Truth be told, on her final mission,

23:24.504 --> 23:26.872
to save her own skin,
she let her own partner die.

23:26.906 --> 23:28.940
<i>I think that would be an indication</i>

23:28.975 --> 23:31.410
of exactly the type of
person <i>you're dealing with.</i>

23:31.444 --> 23:34.212
She might very well
do the same to you...

23:39.252 --> 23:40.917
or to your daughter.

23:43.823 --> 23:45.390
Well, as I said, Agent Mallory,

23:45.425 --> 23:49.094
as far as where Hayley is,
I haven't got a clue.

23:49.128 --> 23:50.495
[Chuckles]

23:50.530 --> 23:54.066
Well, if you ever get one,

23:54.100 --> 23:58.603
it would be in your
best interest to call.

24:09.015 --> 24:11.450
What was all that about MI6
having proof you're behind this?

24:11.484 --> 24:12.384
It's all lies.

24:12.418 --> 24:14.653
Even what he said
about your old partner?

24:14.687 --> 24:16.128
That was a lie, too?

24:19.492 --> 24:21.660
You let your partner die.

24:21.694 --> 24:25.330
No. Wesley died because...

24:29.143 --> 24:32.771
because... It's complicated.

24:32.805 --> 24:35.006
Look,
don't let Mallory get into your head.

24:35.041 --> 24:37.107
You know you can trust me.

24:39.479 --> 24:41.513
[Beeping]

24:42.749 --> 24:43.982
Hey.

24:44.016 --> 24:44.950
<i>Your tip about the corset paid off.</i>

24:44.984 --> 24:46.651
You found Karla?

24:46.686 --> 24:48.787
We reached out to that lingerie
shop and I.D.'d our blonde.

24:48.821 --> 24:49.988
<i>Her real name is Beth Wynne.</i>

24:50.022 --> 24:52.224
<i>She's a longtime grifter
who's worked a lot of scams.</i>

24:52.258 --> 24:53.058
Interesting.

24:53.092 --> 24:54.993
And get this... One of her aliases

24:55.027 --> 24:57.796
just checked into a
motel at 153rd by JFK.

24:57.830 --> 24:58.897
<i>We're headed there right now.</i>

24:58.931 --> 24:59.598
Esposito:
<i>We'll let you know if we find her.</i>

24:59.632 --> 25:01.099
Castle: All right. [Click]

25:02.335 --> 25:03.902
Where are you going?
I thought you were staying out of sight.

25:03.936 --> 25:04.803
She killed my friend.

25:04.837 --> 25:06.538
I'm going to be there for the arrest.

25:06.572 --> 25:08.146
Not alone you're not.

25:14.580 --> 25:17.082
Hayley, you're not supposed to be here.

25:17.116 --> 25:18.316
And yet here I am.

25:18.351 --> 25:20.652
Castle, you didn't stop her?

25:20.686 --> 25:22.888
Like I <i>could</i> stop her
even if I wanted to.

25:22.922 --> 25:24.956
[Door closes] Hey, hey, hey, guys.
That's her.

25:26.058 --> 25:27.526
Esposito: Beth Wynne, NYPD.

25:27.560 --> 25:28.760
Hey! Come here!

25:28.795 --> 25:29.561
Hey!

25:29.595 --> 25:30.328
Oh!

25:31.931 --> 25:33.098
Beth Wynne... [Handcuffs click]

25:33.132 --> 25:34.166
You're under arrest

25:34.200 --> 25:37.068
for the murders of Marcus
Janek and Bryce Roberts.

25:39.743 --> 25:42.170
[Groans] No, no, no.
You are not hanging this on me.

25:42.315 --> 25:43.377
I didn't kill anyone.

25:43.412 --> 25:46.080
When I left Manchester Energy,
Marcus was alive.

25:46.115 --> 25:47.048
I came straight back here.

25:47.082 --> 25:49.250
You can check the motel
surveillance cameras.

25:49.284 --> 25:50.017
And what about Bryce?

25:50.052 --> 25:52.720
I didn't kill him. I was here.

25:52.754 --> 25:54.589
I haven't even left this place till now.

25:54.623 --> 25:57.425
Okay,
then what really happened last night?

25:57.459 --> 25:58.326
What were you doing there

25:58.360 --> 26:00.128
when Hayley and Marcus were breaking in?

26:02.231 --> 26:04.932
I was the bait for that idiot Ned.

26:04.967 --> 26:09.704
The computer system required
two separate security keys.

26:09.738 --> 26:11.939
You can't just hack
in and upload a worm.

26:11.974 --> 26:14.575
It had to be embedded while
a secure portal was open.

26:14.610 --> 26:16.244
So you made sure that Ned logged in.

26:16.278 --> 26:19.247
And after that, the worm that
Hayley unintentionally planted

26:19.281 --> 26:21.449
was allowed to wreak havoc
on London's power grid.

26:21.483 --> 26:22.517
Castle: Wait a minute.

26:22.551 --> 26:24.886
Marcus was a run-of-the-mill
cat burglar at best.

26:24.920 --> 26:27.255
How would he come up with
such an elaborate plan?

26:27.289 --> 26:28.856
He was just following orders.

26:28.891 --> 26:30.124
From who?

26:30.159 --> 26:31.392
[Sighs]

26:32.728 --> 26:34.028
A man named Edgar Patton.

26:34.062 --> 26:35.429
- You never met this man?
- No.

26:35.464 --> 26:37.064
Marcus was the point man,

26:37.099 --> 26:38.566
and he brought me onto this job.

26:38.600 --> 26:40.067
Marcus say anything about him?

26:40.102 --> 26:41.869
Come on, you got to know something.

26:41.904 --> 26:43.771
He's a smoker, I guess.

26:43.805 --> 26:45.439
The night before the job,

26:45.474 --> 26:47.475
Marcus met Edgar at some fancy club

26:47.509 --> 26:48.910
to get the worm program.

26:48.944 --> 26:49.844
When Marcus came back,

26:49.878 --> 26:51.879
both him and his laptop
stunk like cigars,

26:51.914 --> 26:54.515
- and that's all I know.
- Where's Marcus' laptop now?

26:59.621 --> 27:02.123
Okay, if there's still a copy
of the worm program on here,

27:02.157 --> 27:04.125
I might be able to find
out who created it.

27:04.159 --> 27:06.561
Hold on. To attack London's power grid,

27:06.595 --> 27:08.829
you didn't even need Hayley or Bryce.

27:08.864 --> 27:12.633
No. But that's the way Edgar
told Marcus it had to be.

27:13.430 --> 27:14.835
I was chosen specifically.

27:14.870 --> 27:15.937
Yeah.

27:15.971 --> 27:19.006
And your buddy Bryce was
only leveraged to do this job

27:19.041 --> 27:20.875
to get to you.

27:25.180 --> 27:26.514
Our Karla's telling the truth.

27:26.548 --> 27:30.184
Motel security cameras prove that
she was there during Bryce's murder.

27:30.219 --> 27:31.852
Lanie says that both Bryce and Marcus

27:31.887 --> 27:33.588
were stabbed by the same killer,

27:33.622 --> 27:34.956
so it looks like this Edgar guy

27:34.990 --> 27:36.023
is our new number-one suspect.

27:36.058 --> 27:37.358
Any leads on the cigar smoker?

27:37.392 --> 27:39.927
Not yet. We're gonna canvass
smoking clubs throughout the city.

27:39.962 --> 27:40.795
Yeah. If we're lucky,

27:40.829 --> 27:42.964
somebody saw Marcus and Edgar meeting.

27:42.998 --> 27:44.332
And what about that laptop?

27:44.366 --> 27:45.933
Was Hayley able to identify

27:45.968 --> 27:47.635
who created that worm program?

27:47.669 --> 27:49.270
Not yet.

27:52.207 --> 27:54.175
[Keyboard clacking]

27:54.209 --> 27:56.510
[Beeping]

27:56.545 --> 27:57.445
Hayley: Damn it.

27:57.479 --> 27:59.981
You've been working
that thing for hours.

28:00.015 --> 28:01.515
You need to take a break.

28:01.550 --> 28:04.051
Uh, this Edgar fellow has
a serious hurt-on for me,

28:04.086 --> 28:05.720
and he killed Bryce because of it.

28:05.754 --> 28:07.955
I'll take a break when
that bastard is dead.

28:07.990 --> 28:11.392
[Computer beeping]

28:11.426 --> 28:13.894
Hello. I'm in.

28:13.929 --> 28:16.297
I have unlocked the
security for the worm.

28:19.201 --> 28:20.067
What is it?

28:20.102 --> 28:22.203
I recognize this code.

28:22.237 --> 28:23.971
You do? How?

28:24.006 --> 28:27.541
Because I helped design it a long,
long time ago.

28:27.576 --> 28:30.011
W-What are you talking about?

28:31.780 --> 28:34.514
[Sighs] Damn it.

28:34.685 --> 28:35.850
His laptop is rubbish.

28:35.884 --> 28:37.385
I'm gonna need something
with more horsepower

28:37.419 --> 28:38.886
in order to get to the bottom of this.

28:38.920 --> 28:40.521
I'll get your laptop from the back.

28:40.555 --> 28:42.323
You're a dear. Thank you.

28:43.392 --> 28:45.092
Now, if it's partially your code,

28:45.127 --> 28:48.996
then that should help narrow
down who the killer is, right?

28:50.102 --> 28:51.999
Hayley?

28:52.034 --> 28:52.900
Hayley...

28:55.564 --> 28:57.502
Hayley.

28:57.873 --> 28:59.442
Ryan: Hey, guys, we got something.

28:59.775 --> 29:02.477
Yeah. One of those cigar clubs paid off.

29:02.511 --> 29:04.412
Manager recognized Marcus' photo.

29:04.446 --> 29:05.847
Did he see who Marcus was with?

29:05.881 --> 29:06.981
He said Marcus came in alone,

29:07.015 --> 29:08.549
and then he met with a guy
in a brown leather jacket

29:08.584 --> 29:09.317
for about 15 minutes.

29:09.351 --> 29:10.151
Did he get a good look at him?

29:10.185 --> 29:13.054
No, but the club security cam did.

29:13.088 --> 29:16.824
Look... brown leather jacket.
Got to be Edgar.

29:16.859 --> 29:18.025
This guy looks familiar.

29:18.060 --> 29:20.027
Hold on.

29:20.062 --> 29:21.896
[Cellphone rings] Oh.

29:21.930 --> 29:22.897
[Cellphone beeps]

29:22.931 --> 29:24.499
Hey, Alexis.

29:24.533 --> 29:25.533
Dad, Hayley's gone.

29:25.567 --> 29:26.534
Gone where?

29:26.568 --> 29:28.569
I don't know,
but she ditched her cellphone.

29:28.604 --> 29:29.403
I can't track her.

29:29.438 --> 29:30.371
Hang on. I'm putting you on speaker.

29:30.405 --> 29:32.006
[Cellphone beeps]
What was the last thing

29:32.040 --> 29:33.374
Hayley did before she disappeared?

29:33.408 --> 29:34.942
She discovered the computer worm

29:34.977 --> 29:36.744
was one she helped design years ago.

29:36.778 --> 29:39.580
So Edgar used Hayley's own
code to help frame her.

29:39.615 --> 29:41.382
Why did she take off right
when she was closing in?

29:41.416 --> 29:42.917
Because she knows who the killer is,

29:42.951 --> 29:44.886
and his name isn't Edgar.

29:45.323 --> 29:50.057
I did some research on her dead
MI6 partner, Wesley Connors,

29:50.092 --> 29:52.593
and I found this article
from six years ago.

29:52.628 --> 29:54.228
Wait a minute.

29:55.097 --> 29:57.565
Wesley Connors is the man
in the brown leather jacket.

29:57.599 --> 30:00.101
I knew he looked familiar.

30:00.135 --> 30:02.203
This article says he's been executed.

30:02.237 --> 30:03.905
Alexis: Guys,
when Hayley recognized the code,

30:03.939 --> 30:05.606
she looked like she'd just seen a ghost.

30:05.641 --> 30:06.908
Castle: That's because she did.

30:06.942 --> 30:09.710
Wesley Connors is still alive.

30:17.753 --> 30:18.786
Hello?

30:20.489 --> 30:21.756
Wes.

30:23.492 --> 30:24.926
Come on out. It's me.

30:34.013 --> 30:36.216
It worked, Hails.

30:36.797 --> 30:38.940
Our plan worked.

30:43.664 --> 30:45.233
Mallory: This is impossible.

30:45.431 --> 30:47.462
Wesley Connors was caught
and tried for espionage

30:47.528 --> 30:48.633
by the Iranians.

30:48.667 --> 30:50.735
Our intelligence sources
confirmed he was executed.

30:50.770 --> 30:51.903
Well, obviously, they were duped.

30:51.937 --> 30:53.071
Agent Mallory,

30:53.105 --> 30:55.907
this man perpetrated an attack
on the London power grid

30:55.941 --> 30:57.409
and murdered two people,

30:57.443 --> 31:00.259
so it's time to play ball
and tell us what you know.

31:05.651 --> 31:07.752
What I'm about to tell
you is highly classified

31:07.787 --> 31:09.187
and mustn't be repeated.

31:09.221 --> 31:10.922
Are we clear?

31:12.819 --> 31:14.959
The worm that crashed
the London power grid

31:14.994 --> 31:16.294
was a variation on one

31:16.328 --> 31:19.257
Hayley and Wesley
designed six years ago.

31:19.349 --> 31:22.267
It was used to knock out
uranium-enriching centrifuges

31:22.301 --> 31:24.235
at the Natanz reactor in Iran.

31:24.270 --> 31:25.437
Are you talking about Stuxnet?

31:25.471 --> 31:27.639
That computer virus

31:27.673 --> 31:29.908
set the Iranian nuclear
program back by decades.

31:29.942 --> 31:32.544
Stuxnet was supposedly created
by the U.S. and Israel.

31:32.578 --> 31:34.312
Disinformation, Captain,

31:34.346 --> 31:36.047
leaked by Her Majesty's government.

31:36.082 --> 31:38.483
We wanted to hit the Iranians
as much as everyone else,

31:38.562 --> 31:40.652
so we put our best two agents on it.

31:40.686 --> 31:41.553
Hayley and Wesley.

31:41.587 --> 31:44.489
Led by the recently
deceased Bryce Roberts.

31:44.523 --> 31:46.925
The op was a success.

31:46.959 --> 31:50.495
However,
their extraction point was compromised.

31:51.260 --> 31:53.932
You said Hayley left Wesley to die.

31:53.966 --> 31:57.068
Yes, well, I might have
exaggerated a bit to make a point.

31:57.103 --> 32:00.305
Truth is,
Wesley was late to the rendezvous,

32:00.339 --> 32:02.574
and MI6 command made the call.

32:02.608 --> 32:04.909
That's why Hayley left MI6.

32:04.944 --> 32:06.945
She felt that they betrayed Wesley

32:06.979 --> 32:07.846
and condemned him to die.

32:07.880 --> 32:10.682
Which brings us to our current dilemma.

32:10.716 --> 32:13.485
Hayley and Wesley were thick as thieves,

32:13.519 --> 32:15.086
more loyal to each
other than the service.

32:15.121 --> 32:16.154
What are you saying?

32:16.188 --> 32:18.289
That it would appear they
have teamed up once again

32:18.324 --> 32:19.491
to have their retribution.

32:19.525 --> 32:21.926
- You're wrong.
- Am I, Mr. Castle?

32:21.961 --> 32:25.096
Then, tell me,
why has Hayley suddenly disappeared?

32:27.833 --> 32:29.134
Hayley: I don't understand.

32:29.168 --> 32:30.869
They showed me proof you were dead.

32:30.903 --> 32:32.637
No. [Chuckles]

32:32.671 --> 32:34.973
I just wished I was.

32:40.746 --> 32:42.647
What did they do to you?

32:42.681 --> 32:43.681
You know me.

32:43.716 --> 32:46.217
I hate taking orders,
so sometimes I refused.

32:46.252 --> 32:47.986
But they never liked that.

32:48.020 --> 32:50.722
Sometimes I wished they'd
just finish me off.

32:50.756 --> 32:52.857
There was times I tried to myself.

32:52.892 --> 32:54.359
Wes, I'm sorry.

32:54.393 --> 32:55.527
Don't be.

32:55.561 --> 32:56.961
[Chuckles]

32:56.996 --> 32:59.030
See, you're the person
that got me through it all.

32:59.064 --> 33:01.499
You know how?

33:01.534 --> 33:03.835
Our plan.

33:05.337 --> 33:07.872
It kept me going for six years,
gave me the will to escape.

33:07.907 --> 33:09.807
You keep saying "our plan." I...

33:09.842 --> 33:13.645
Our bloody retirement plan.
Come on, Hails.

33:13.679 --> 33:14.979
We used to talk all the time

33:15.014 --> 33:16.915
about how if we survived
the Queen's service,

33:16.949 --> 33:19.751
we'd spend the rest of our days
traveling the world in style.

33:19.785 --> 33:20.718
You remember.

33:20.753 --> 33:22.653
- $10 million each.
- Yeah.

33:22.759 --> 33:24.923
Have you checked your
bank account lately?

33:24.957 --> 33:27.926
Now you have it, and so do I.

33:27.960 --> 33:29.894
You passed the test.

33:29.929 --> 33:31.996
This was all a loyalty test?

33:32.031 --> 33:33.765
[Sighs] It was the only way to know.

33:33.799 --> 33:34.933
I had to put a target on your back

33:34.967 --> 33:37.035
and make sure you wouldn't
capitulate to the authorities,

33:37.069 --> 33:38.036
but you didn't.

33:38.070 --> 33:39.938
Wesley, you murdered people.
You killed Bryce.

33:39.972 --> 33:41.439
You're damn right I did!

33:41.473 --> 33:45.924
He and Her Majesty's
Kingdom abandoned me,

33:46.452 --> 33:47.912
so they had to be punished.

33:47.947 --> 33:49.414
Which is why you sent our worm

33:49.448 --> 33:51.916
to plunge London into darkness.

33:51.951 --> 33:55.253
Oh, Wes, your captors drove you mad.

33:55.287 --> 33:57.021
[Scoffs]

33:57.056 --> 33:59.591
How can you of all
people say that to me?

33:59.625 --> 34:02.121
They had it coming.

34:02.451 --> 34:04.206
They all did.

34:05.064 --> 34:07.131
[Chuckles] Don't you see that?

34:07.166 --> 34:09.934
Wesley, I'm sorry.

34:09.969 --> 34:11.725
I'm so, so sorry.

34:12.004 --> 34:13.905
I have to take you in.

34:29.688 --> 34:30.888
[Grunts]

34:31.757 --> 34:33.123
[Thud]

34:33.158 --> 34:35.726
Mallory:
The rendezvous was predetermined.

34:35.761 --> 34:38.730
Predetermined because Hayley and Wesley

34:38.764 --> 34:39.998
are in league with one another.

34:40.032 --> 34:41.599
They are not working together.

34:41.634 --> 34:42.600
[Scoffs]

34:43.687 --> 34:45.837
But they were at one point.

34:45.871 --> 34:48.514
They were partners for years,
working various black ops,

34:48.581 --> 34:49.742
maybe even one here in New York.

34:49.795 --> 34:52.447
Beckett: Where they had an old
safehouse or a staging area,

34:52.485 --> 34:55.980
someplace that they both
knew about and could trust.

34:58.903 --> 35:01.555
Okay, look,
I can neither confirm nor deny

35:01.594 --> 35:04.022
MI6 has ever carried out
any operations on U.S. soil.

35:04.057 --> 35:06.558
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Just tell us where it is.

35:14.620 --> 35:16.034
[Groaning]

35:23.831 --> 35:26.378
I am shocked, Hayley.

35:26.412 --> 35:28.046
You always used to kick my ass

35:28.081 --> 35:30.148
whenever we sparred back in the day.

35:32.512 --> 35:34.886
So, what's the plan, Wesley?

35:34.921 --> 35:36.588
You gonna torture me like they did you?

35:36.622 --> 35:38.356
I would never do that to a friend.

35:38.391 --> 35:39.860
I'll make it quick.

35:41.294 --> 35:43.261
It was fun for a moment,
though, wasn't it?

35:43.296 --> 35:45.430
The thought of us together again.

35:46.393 --> 35:49.334
Do you know why we were
such effective spies?

35:50.503 --> 35:52.792
Because we lived for
the rush of the mission.

35:53.570 --> 35:55.945
We were willing to die for that high.

35:56.642 --> 35:58.076
And we were wrong.

35:58.622 --> 36:01.113
After a lifetime of
not letting anyone in,

36:01.147 --> 36:02.198
not even each other,

36:02.330 --> 36:04.649
I found people who tore down my walls.

36:04.684 --> 36:07.552
I found a family, and they're wonderful.

36:07.587 --> 36:09.287
[Laughs]

36:09.322 --> 36:11.456
So that's why I gave you such a kicking.

36:11.491 --> 36:13.625
You've went and got soft on me, Hayley.

36:13.659 --> 36:15.827
Wesley, don't do this. Let me help you.

36:15.862 --> 36:16.862
Help <i>me?</i>

36:16.896 --> 36:19.498
Love, you're not in a
position to help yourself.

36:19.532 --> 36:22.300
Listen, I was your friend once,

36:22.335 --> 36:25.170
arguably the only one you've
ever had in your entire life.

36:25.204 --> 36:28.740
Please let me be your friend once again.

36:31.163 --> 36:31.843
[Sighs]

36:31.878 --> 36:35.580
The only friend I need is my $10 million

36:35.615 --> 36:36.615
and perhaps yours.

36:36.649 --> 36:37.415
[Button clicks]

36:37.450 --> 36:39.117
[Groans]

36:39.152 --> 36:42.287
Wesley, Wesley...

36:42.321 --> 36:43.933
[Whimpers]

36:47.059 --> 36:48.458
Wesley. No, no. [Screams]

36:51.959 --> 36:53.226
- No.
- Wesley Connors!

36:53.260 --> 36:55.228
- NYPD! Police!
- Drop the knife now!

36:55.262 --> 36:56.603
Hey!

37:00.033 --> 37:01.301
[Groaning] Easy, easy.

37:01.335 --> 37:02.368
- You okay?
- Yeah.

37:02.403 --> 37:04.404
There are secret exits only
Wesley and I know about.

37:04.438 --> 37:06.461
He's gonna double back and disappear.

37:07.908 --> 37:09.141
They went that way.

37:09.176 --> 37:10.920
We...

37:11.578 --> 37:13.312
Damn it.

37:28.195 --> 37:30.196
[Light clanking]

37:36.085 --> 37:37.670
Wesley.

37:37.704 --> 37:38.671
[Gun clicks]

37:38.705 --> 37:40.506
Let me see your hands.

37:45.712 --> 37:47.079
Drop the knife.

37:47.114 --> 37:49.015
There's only one way
this is going to end.

37:49.049 --> 37:52.018
- Stop.
- Either you die or I die.

37:52.052 --> 37:53.653
Wesley, don't make me do this.

37:53.687 --> 37:54.654
Come on, Hails.

37:54.688 --> 37:56.922
You killed me once already.

37:56.957 --> 37:59.525
Don't. I hated myself for leaving you.

37:59.559 --> 38:02.194
Water under the bridge, darling.

38:02.229 --> 38:04.764
And whatever happens in the
next 10 seconds, no regrets.

38:05.411 --> 38:07.066
For me, it's freedom or death.

38:07.100 --> 38:08.567
Wesley, please.

38:08.602 --> 38:09.735
Goodbye, Hayley.

38:09.770 --> 38:10.536
Wesley, no!

38:10.570 --> 38:11.537
[Gunshot]

38:18.612 --> 38:20.346
Hayley.

38:24.985 --> 38:27.180
You had no choice.

38:27.813 --> 38:29.622
Esposito: Castle!

38:29.656 --> 38:31.045
Hayley?

38:47.808 --> 38:48.941
- Esposito: Hey.
- Beckett: Hey.

38:48.975 --> 38:51.410
Nice job smoothing things
over with the feds for Hayley.

38:51.445 --> 38:52.645
Yeah, well, it didn't hurt

38:52.679 --> 38:53.579
that they were able to take credit

38:53.613 --> 38:55.614
for closing down a terrorism case, so...

38:55.649 --> 38:58.427
Oh, let there be light.

38:58.785 --> 39:00.152
That was fast. [Chuckles]

39:00.187 --> 39:02.755
Well, since Hayley co-created the worm,

39:02.789 --> 39:05.391
she knew exactly how to help
the U.K. authorities defeat it.

39:05.425 --> 39:06.392
All's well that ends well.

39:06.426 --> 39:07.727
Beckett: Speaking of endings,
I can't think

39:07.761 --> 39:09.662
of a better way to end this day

39:09.696 --> 39:11.797
than by downing a few ice-cold
ones with my lead detectives.

39:11.832 --> 39:12.598
How about it?

39:12.632 --> 39:13.799
- Yeah.
- Okay.

39:13.834 --> 39:15.000
- You're buying, right?
- Yeah, exactly.

39:15.035 --> 39:17.103
All right. Captain's money.
Got that captain's money.

39:17.137 --> 39:18.571
Castle: Well done.

39:19.840 --> 39:22.141
I heard you were single malt fans.

39:22.175 --> 39:24.610
From Her Majesty's special reserve.

39:24.644 --> 39:28.848
She truly appreciates everyone's
discretion in this matter.

39:28.882 --> 39:31.984
W-Well,
one does not want to insult the Queen.

39:32.018 --> 39:34.353
I come bearing another gift...

39:34.387 --> 39:36.655
An offer to return to service.

39:38.787 --> 39:42.528
MI6's door is wide-open to you,
Agent Shipton.

39:42.562 --> 39:43.997
What do you say?

39:47.731 --> 39:49.604
[Chuckles]

39:49.934 --> 39:51.966
I say...

39:52.339 --> 39:53.639
piss off, mate.

39:55.198 --> 39:57.810
Well, if you ever change your mind,

39:57.844 --> 39:59.712
you know where to find us.

39:59.746 --> 40:01.847
Fat chance, but thank the Queen.

40:01.882 --> 40:03.289
[Chuckles] Mm-hmm.

40:07.554 --> 40:08.687
[Door opens]

40:10.757 --> 40:11.791
[Door closes]

40:11.825 --> 40:15.127
Hey... you all right?

40:15.162 --> 40:17.363
Sure. I'm fine.

40:17.397 --> 40:19.765
You don't have to mourn your
friends alone, you know?

40:22.836 --> 40:25.504
You don't have to do
anything alone ever again.

40:33.914 --> 40:35.247
Hey.

40:35.282 --> 40:36.816
[Door closes]

40:36.850 --> 40:38.584
A red rose for the lady.

40:38.618 --> 40:39.618
Oh.

40:39.653 --> 40:41.353
You know,
the French would say "je suis désolé."

40:41.388 --> 40:42.822
In Spanish, "lo siento."

40:42.856 --> 40:44.523
In Latin, "mea culpa."

40:44.558 --> 40:46.826
- Okay, you're apologizing. I get it.
- Yes.

40:46.860 --> 40:49.228
Because I have been
keeping something from you

40:49.262 --> 40:50.896
that your subconscious mind picked up on

40:50.931 --> 40:51.697
and caused you to have a dream

40:51.731 --> 40:53.232
that I betrayed you in some way.

40:53.266 --> 40:54.600
Castle, I thought that we said

40:54.634 --> 40:56.168
we weren't gonna keep any more secrets.

40:56.203 --> 40:57.937
I know, and I just... I consider this

40:57.971 --> 40:59.505
more of a surprise than a secret.

40:59.539 --> 41:00.706
But I should have known better

41:00.740 --> 41:03.876
than to try and surprise the
world's greatest detective,

41:03.910 --> 41:04.877
after Batman.

41:04.911 --> 41:06.696
W-What's behind the sheet?

41:07.514 --> 41:09.882
Kate...

41:09.916 --> 41:11.450
you've been going
through a lot of changes

41:11.484 --> 41:12.751
these past few years.

41:12.786 --> 41:15.588
You gave up your place, you got married,

41:15.622 --> 41:16.889
and you became a captain.

41:16.923 --> 41:19.225
But some of the things that you love

41:19.259 --> 41:21.227
have fallen by the wayside,

41:21.261 --> 41:24.129
including one thing
that's been gathering dust

41:24.164 --> 41:26.098
in your father's garage.

41:26.132 --> 41:28.334
- You didn't?
- I did.

41:29.903 --> 41:32.404
[Gasps] Oh!

41:32.439 --> 41:34.273
I had it completely restored.

41:35.652 --> 41:37.209
I...

41:37.244 --> 41:38.310
Yeah, sit on it.

41:38.345 --> 41:40.246
[Laughs]

41:42.949 --> 41:44.483
What, I-I just...

41:44.517 --> 41:46.819
[Gasps]

41:46.853 --> 41:49.688
I think you should take the
bike on a cross-country trip.

41:50.579 --> 41:52.825
It's something you've
always wanted to do.

41:52.859 --> 41:54.260
This is amazing.

41:54.294 --> 41:55.628
I love this.

41:55.662 --> 41:58.731
But I-I don't want to do this alone.

41:58.765 --> 41:59.932
Why don't you get some lessons?

41:59.966 --> 42:02.301
I was hoping you'd say that,

42:02.335 --> 42:04.503
because I already got my
license and I bought a bike.

42:04.537 --> 42:07.006
It's at the garage to the office.

42:07.040 --> 42:08.007
I love you.

42:08.041 --> 42:08.974
I love you.

42:09.009 --> 42:09.909
Yeah. Mwah.

42:09.943 --> 42:11.644
Does this mean that you won't be having

42:11.678 --> 42:12.811
any more bad dreams about me tonight?

42:12.846 --> 42:15.080
No, 'cause we're not sleeping tonight.

42:15.982 --> 42:17.516
Unh-unh!

42:17.550 --> 42:19.251
Bring the helmet.

42:23.290 --> 42:25.024
Safety first.
