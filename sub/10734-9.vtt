I've got an idea, but it'll take
timing, cooperation, and it's

13:07.524 --> 13:12.661
extremely dangerous. You in?
- "Danger" is my middle name.

13:12.696 --> 13:15.730
Blox: I thought "trouble" was
your middle name.

13:19.502 --> 13:22.571
[ snarls ]

13:22.606 --> 13:23.939
Pyxi! Cork it!

13:23.974 --> 13:24.639
[ ding ]

13:24.675 --> 13:26.808
<i>[ mumbling indistinctly ]
...buffalo.</i>

13:26.843 --> 13:28.309
[ roars ]

13:31.981 --> 13:32.814
[ grunts ]

13:32.849 --> 13:36.284
[ strained ] I'm not moving!
- Rook: Be still!

13:36.319 --> 13:37.685
Blox: Guys! No!

13:37.720 --> 13:39.587
[ snarling ]

13:41.423 --> 13:42.323
[ both gasp ]

13:42.359 --> 13:45.927
The Paxter really doesn't
go in for the violence.

13:45.962 --> 13:47.629
[ roars ]

13:47.665 --> 13:49.297
<i>Whoa! I'm your side!</i>

13:49.333 --> 13:52.066
[ chomps ]

13:52.102 --> 13:54.335
[ gasps ]

14:00.441 --> 14:06.178
H-Hey! You're not
making a salad, you know?

14:06.214 --> 14:10.916
[ chuckling ] All right, brother.
This is what you're after.

14:10.951 --> 14:13.151
[ chomps ]

14:13.186 --> 14:16.020
[ sniffing ]

14:16.056 --> 14:20.625
Great plan.
- Blox: I can't help how it turned out.

14:20.660 --> 14:23.061
[ chomping ]

14:26.132 --> 14:26.932
[ muffled grunting ]

14:26.967 --> 14:28.300
Blox: Shh!

14:29.836 --> 14:31.804
[ growling softly ]

14:34.140 --> 14:38.811
So not cool, man. Forcing
me to use my, you know...

14:38.846 --> 14:39.412
[ beeping ]

14:39.447 --> 14:43.349
...natural essence to exploit
a poor, defenseless ...

14:43.385 --> 14:45.418
Ben: Dude, that wasn't the plan!

14:45.454 --> 14:49.223
But if I'd known you were edible,
I would have made you the plan.

14:49.258 --> 14:51.959
[ crash, rumbling ]

14:51.994 --> 14:54.328
Pyxi! Status report!

14:54.363 --> 14:54.895
[ ding ]

14:54.930 --> 14:58.465
<i>[ muttering indistinctly ] ...flugelhorn

14:58.500 --> 14:59.933
<i>[ muttering continues ]</i>

14:59.969 --> 15:01.068
Ben: What did she say?!

15:01.103 --> 15:03.804
[ rapid beeping ]

15:03.839 --> 15:05.739
<i>Attention, alien vessel.</i>

15:05.775 --> 15:10.077
<i>This is commander Raff, of the
unstoppable Incursean armada.</i>

15:10.113 --> 15:13.747
<i>You are suspiciously disabled in
Incursean space.</i>

15:13.783 --> 15:17.653
<i>Prepare to be boarded and searched.</i>

15:18.688 --> 15:21.689
Ben: Never mind.
I'm up to speed.

15:27.270 --> 15:29.638
Rook: The Incurseans are
about to board us, and the

15:29.673 --> 15:31.806
Gracklflint has disabled our
weapons.

15:31.842 --> 15:34.976
The worm has turned, man.
That's all I know.

15:35.011 --> 15:37.245
The worm has turned.

15:43.152 --> 15:44.453
Rook: Agreed.

15:44.488 --> 15:46.321
[ beep ]

15:46.357 --> 15:47.756
[ ding ]

15:47.792 --> 15:51.494
<i>...superheterodyne fracas...
[ muttering indistinctly ]</i>

15:51.529 --> 15:53.263
Grey Matter: Pyxi's right.

15:53.298 --> 15:56.433
A standoff's gonna thrash what's
left of the ship.

15:56.468 --> 15:58.635
Hey!
I understood that!

15:58.670 --> 16:01.638
<i>[ muttering indistinctly ]
...bentura voulebard...</i>

16:01.673 --> 16:03.539
<i>[ muttering continues ]</i>

16:03.575 --> 16:06.142
Grey Matter: Don't worry.
If Grey Matter's brilliant

16:06.177 --> 16:09.945
little brain can't get us
out of this, nothing can.

16:09.981 --> 16:13.249
Rook: Ben?
- Grey Matter: I'm thinking.

16:18.422 --> 16:22.658
I am totally bummed out!
I'm a failure!

16:22.694 --> 16:26.896
I helped put a living, beautiful
Gracklflint in a box!

16:26.931 --> 16:28.031
[ crying ]

16:28.066 --> 16:29.632
[ voice breaking ] Not cool.

16:29.668 --> 16:32.668
Rook: That "beautiful"
creature disabled our engines,

16:32.704 --> 16:35.638
weapons systems, and merchant
vessel license broadcast.

16:35.673 --> 16:37.840
And we are now endangered, as well.

16:37.875 --> 16:41.627
Why is freeing the human and
the Revonnahgander and the

16:41.628 --> 16:45.380
duck any less important
than freeing the Gracklflint?

16:45.416 --> 16:47.883
Oh, hey, was that me?

16:47.918 --> 16:50.719
Grey Matter: Eureka!
I shall fix the Lovely Duck.

16:50.754 --> 16:54.355
Rook, slip out the exhaust vents
and cut us loose.

16:54.391 --> 16:56.491
Rad, clear this ship of frogs.

16:56.526 --> 17:00.863
[ weapons cock ] I will make
them cry for their mamas.

17:00.899 --> 17:03.166
Grey Matter: Pyxi...
<i>- Tiny bubbles.</i>

17:03.202 --> 17:06.303
Grey Matter: Get ready to floor it.
<i>- Buffalo.</i>

17:06.339 --> 17:07.538
A-And what do I do?

17:07.573 --> 17:11.009
Grey Matter: Go to the cargo
bay and... be yourself.

17:16.848 --> 17:20.518
Fan out! Confiscate, capture,
and destroy anything that moves!

17:20.553 --> 17:22.019
[ croaks ]

17:26.124 --> 17:29.893
Hey, frogs in boots.
How's it goin'?

17:29.928 --> 17:34.030
Major Glorf, have the captain
and his cargo brought to me.

17:34.065 --> 17:37.199
Search the ship.
- Grey Matter: Pyxi, the

17:37.235 --> 17:40.369
airlock's damaged, so I have to
time these doors just right.

17:40.405 --> 17:44.473
Can you give me master control?
<i>- Marzipan coachella unguent...</i>

17:44.509 --> 17:46.876
[ muttering indistinctly ]

17:46.911 --> 17:47.877
[ ding ]

17:50.647 --> 17:54.216
You're just lucky that I'm a
pacifist.

18:08.698 --> 18:11.067
Huh?!
It's a duck.

18:14.037 --> 18:15.571
Duck this!

18:20.777 --> 18:22.411
You're the captain?

18:22.446 --> 18:27.281
Eh... I'm not really into,
you know, titles.

18:27.317 --> 18:31.986
Open it!
- Can do. Can do.

18:36.991 --> 18:40.226
[ snarling ]

18:40.262 --> 18:42.495
[ growls ]

18:46.901 --> 18:49.870
[ screaming ]

18:49.905 --> 18:51.872
[ croaks ]

19:01.582 --> 19:06.721
Go on, little Gracklflint.
Revel in your freedom.

19:11.025 --> 19:12.392
[ snarls ]

19:12.428 --> 19:14.394
[ indistinct shouting ]

19:16.230 --> 19:17.698
[ gun beeping ]

19:17.733 --> 19:20.234
Stand your ground!
Run!

19:25.741 --> 19:30.345
Grey Matter: Reroute the Parmian bypass,
account for radiological fluctuations.

19:30.381 --> 19:34.383
Warpdrive upshift mechanism
recalibrated.

19:39.490 --> 19:41.090
[ engines rumble ]

19:41.126 --> 19:43.126
[ all screaming ]

19:53.704 --> 19:56.239
Cargo doors open!
Go, Pyxi!

20:05.183 --> 20:06.650
Whoa!

20:10.388 --> 20:12.189
<i>I thought you guys were cool.</i>

20:12.224 --> 20:15.392
You totally abandoned that
poor little Gracklflint!

20:15.428 --> 20:18.895
Wait for it, salad brain.
- Wait for what?!

20:18.930 --> 20:22.465
I mean, I went along with your
plan, but I don't see ...

20:22.501 --> 20:23.133
[ beep, beep ]

20:23.168 --> 20:24.568
<i>Attention, alien vessel.</i>

20:24.603 --> 20:28.738
<i>This is commander Raff of the
deathless Incursean battle armada.</i>

20:28.773 --> 20:31.007
Ben: Oh, hey, Raff.
Long time.

20:31.042 --> 20:33.409
Ben Tennyson!
I might have known.

20:33.444 --> 20:34.610
[ frogs screaming ]

20:34.646 --> 20:38.181
Remove this beast from my ship,
and I'll grant you safe passage.

20:38.216 --> 20:40.884
Ben: And?
<i>- And?! And what?!</i>

20:40.919 --> 20:45.055
And a set of Galvan
horizontal thrusters.

20:45.090 --> 20:46.990
<i>Fine! Fine! Anything!</i>

20:47.025 --> 20:49.626
<i>Just get this monstrosity off my ship!</i>

20:49.662 --> 20:53.464
<i>And none of you ever mention
this incident to anyone!</i>

21:04.008 --> 21:05.142
[ sighs ]

21:05.177 --> 21:06.810
Thank you.

21:09.513 --> 21:13.016
The Pax cannot abide this
whole leash thing, man.

21:13.051 --> 21:17.488
Rook: I am suppressing an inordinately
powerful urge to knock you out.

21:17.523 --> 21:20.324
Ben: Don't worry, Pax.
Rad Dudesman's gonna transport

21:20.359 --> 21:23.694
this guy to a place where the
Gracklflints run free.

21:23.729 --> 21:27.498
So long as I am paid.
"Profit" is my middle name.

21:27.534 --> 21:29.501
Ben: Sure it is.

21:31.838 --> 21:36.075
Attaboy, man!
Get the tuber! Get it!

21:36.110 --> 21:37.910
Yes, you can!
[ crash ]

21:37.945 --> 21:41.046
Rook: Ben.
I accessed Rad's dossier.

21:41.082 --> 21:45.017
Awards, commendations, and
outstanding judgments ...

21:45.053 --> 21:46.752
all in the name of...

21:46.788 --> 21:51.023
Ben: "Captain Rad Profit
Danger Trouble Dudesman."

21:51.059 --> 21:52.992
Told you.
