17:14.825 --> 17:15.951
{\an8}THERE'S NO NEED TO BE RUDE
TO THESE GIRLS

17:16.034 --> 17:18.287

17:53.614 --> 17:55.824
{\an8}- ELISE,

17:55.908 --> 17:58.327
{\an8}- I DON'T WANNA STAY
IN HERE WITH HIM.

17:58.410 --> 18:00.579
{\an8}- DON'T COME OVER TO SOMEBODY'S
HOUSE AT [bleep] 5:00 A.M.

18:00.662 --> 18:02.206
{\an8}AND EXPECT [bleep] JUST
TO WATCH--AND PLAY CHECKERS.

18:02.289 --> 18:05.709

ABOUT CHECKERS, OLD MAN.

WASN'T AS D.T.F. AS THE OTHER,

18:21.141 --> 18:23.268
{\an8}I KNEW I COULD MAKE IT WORK
WITH EITHER ONE.

18:23.352 --> 18:25.354

TO BE 100% D.T.F.

18:25.437 --> 18:26.772
{\an8}I COULD HAVE GOT IT IN,

18:26.855 --> 18:28.524
{\an8}BUT DIDN'T GET IT IN
BECAUSE OF MIKE.

KICKED OUT OF THE CLUB,

18:31.109 --> 18:32.194

18:48.085 --> 18:49.503
{\an8}- MIKE COULD NOT PLAY
WINGMAN FOR ME.

18:49.586 --> 18:52.881
{\an8}I NEED SOMEBODY THAT KNOWS
HOW TO TAKE ONE FOR THE TEAM

18:52.965 --> 18:54.091
