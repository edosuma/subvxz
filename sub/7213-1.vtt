Go out and live a normal life...

1:33:53.753 --> 1:33:55.221
...love...

1:33:55.713 --> 1:33:57.340
...be free.

1:33:58.716 --> 1:34:00.844
You have to live for all of us now.

1:34:01.344 --> 1:34:04.564
-Baby, no. You can't do that.
-Yes, Sweet Pea.

1:34:04.722 --> 1:34:06.599
You're the strongest.

1:34:06.766 --> 1:34:09.736
You're the only one of us
that ever had a chance out there.

1:34:09.894 --> 1:34:12.397
You going home and living,
that's how we win.

1:34:12.981 --> 1:34:15.450
It's okay. it's okay. it's better this way.

1:34:17.569 --> 1:34:19.162
Now listen.

1:34:19.863 --> 1:34:21.581
I'm gonna walk out there...

1:34:22.574 --> 1:34:25.373
...and when they come after me,
you go, okay?

1:34:26.119 --> 1:34:27.837
There's gotta be another way.

1:34:28.580 --> 1:34:30.082
No.

1:34:31.249 --> 1:34:32.796
This is right.

1:34:35.753 --> 1:34:37.926
This was never my story.

1:34:38.715 --> 1:34:40.262
It's yours.

1:34:40.675 --> 1:34:42.427
Now, don't screw it up, okay?

1:34:47.599 --> 1:34:50.478
You stay off the roads
and you find a bus station, all right?

1:34:51.603 --> 1:34:53.355
You're gonna be fine.

1:35:18.087 --> 1:35:20.215
Where you going, sweetheart?

1:35:30.975 --> 1:35:34.070
I said, where you going?

1:35:35.813 --> 1:35:37.406
[GRUNTING]

1:35:58.878 --> 1:36:00.505
Jesus.

1:36:05.343 --> 1:36:06.765
Did--'?

1:36:07.762 --> 1:36:09.981
Did you see the way she looked at me?

1:36:12.016 --> 1:36:15.270
Just in that last moment. It was like ....

1:36:24.028 --> 1:36:25.496
Doctor?

1:36:25.822 --> 1:36:26.869
Is it done?

1:36:27.031 --> 1:36:30.786
Dr. Gorski, what do you know
about this one?

1:36:30.952 --> 1:36:33.580
Uh, there was something very peculiar.

1:36:33.746 --> 1:36:37.046
Yes. Her mother's death plunged her
into a deep depression.

1:36:37.208 --> 1:36:41.088
And then in a fit,
she accidentally killed her sister.

1:36:41.254 --> 1:36:42.380
Poor child.

1:36:43.339 --> 1:36:48.266
It's a shame I couldn't do more for her.
I wasn't given much time, you see.

1:36:48.428 --> 1:36:50.977
Yes, but you recommended
the procedure.

1:36:51.139 --> 1:36:52.891
Oh, I'm afraid not.

1:36:53.057 --> 1:36:55.401
I will admit she has been
quite a handful.

1:36:55.560 --> 1:37:00.441
In just one week here,
she stabbed an orderly, started a fire...

1:37:00.606 --> 1:37:03.234
...and helped another patient to escape.

1:37:05.528 --> 1:37:08.077
But I don't agree with this solution,
doctor.

1:37:08.239 --> 1:37:12.085
But why would you sign for a procedure
you don't agree with?

1:37:12.243 --> 1:37:13.586
Well, I--

1:37:17.582 --> 1:37:19.425
DOCTOR:
That is your signature, is it not?

1:37:20.043 --> 1:37:22.922
I've been doing this
for quite some time, doctor...

1:37:23.087 --> 1:37:26.762
...and to be honest with you, I've wondered
myself whether or not it's right.

1:37:26.924 --> 1:37:31.395
And I have seen some tortured souls
in here. Believe me.

1:37:31.554 --> 1:37:32.771
But this one ....

1:37:33.681 --> 1:37:35.775
Something in her eyes.

1:37:36.100 --> 1:37:38.353
I've never seen anyone that ....

1:37:39.270 --> 1:37:41.272
it's the way she looked at me.

1:37:41.439 --> 1:37:43.658
It's like she wanted me to do it.

1:37:48.363 --> 1:37:49.785
I hope it helps her.

1:38:33.199 --> 1:38:34.826

1:38:44.627 --> 1:38:45.844
These boys do too.

1:38:46.879 --> 1:38:48.927
This is not the way
we should be running this place.

-I'm not hurting these girls anymore.
-I'm not doing this.

1:39:03.855 --> 1:39:07.109
Guys, don't do this to me now, please.

1:39:07.275 --> 1:39:09.027
I need her in that chair.

1:39:10.903 --> 1:39:13.702
Put her in the goddamn chair!

have you been doing up here?
