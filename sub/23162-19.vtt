WEBVTT

00:00.017 --> 00:03.521
I am looking for my beloved
half-brother, Jonathan Higgins.

00:06.991 --> 00:08.061
How's he doing this?

00:08.125 --> 00:10.230
I don't know,
but it's Higgins all right.

00:10.294 --> 00:12.535
Unhand me at once.
Ooh!

00:12.596 --> 00:14.200
- Magnum.
- Higgins?

00:14.732 --> 00:16.234
Jonathan.
Don Luis.

00:16.300 --> 00:17.335
Oh, my God.

00:17.401 --> 00:20.746
Don Luis Mongueo is a national
bad joke in Costa de Rosa,

00:20.805 --> 00:22.716
and an insult to President
lbenez and his government.

00:22.773 --> 00:23.774
Higgins, what happened?

00:26.210 --> 00:27.211
What's going on?

00:27.278 --> 00:28.279
<i>That's what I'd like to know.</i>

02:26.749 --> 02:27.989
<i>Gracias, Maria.</i>

04:28.738 --> 04:30.183
Don't be afraid, my dear.

04:30.239 --> 04:32.845
My name is Albert Stanley Higgins
and I'm here to help you.

04:51.661 --> 04:53.334
<i>Spending hours
staring at Higgins</i>

04:53.396 --> 04:55.774
<i>is not exactly
my idea of fun.</i>

04:55.831 --> 04:59.244
<i>But when the face staring back at
me is red and resigned to defeat,</i>

04:59.302 --> 05:03.114
<i>then time wasted with Higgins can
actually be described as enjoyable.</i>

05:03.773 --> 05:07.050
<i>In his ordered little world, there's
a rule to cover everything,</i>

05:07.109 --> 05:09.521
<i>from fighting a war
to watering the flowers.</i>

05:09.579 --> 05:12.617
<i>Following the rules is far more
important than the reason for them.</i>

05:12.682 --> 05:15.253
<i>There are even rules
for following the rules.</i>

05:15.318 --> 05:18.527
<i>And when you dare to vary from
his interpretation of the rules,</i>

05:19.088 --> 05:20.465
<i>Higgins gets unruly.</i>

05:21.824 --> 05:23.064
This is an outrage.

05:24.694 --> 05:26.731
It's also checkmate... Again.

05:26.796 --> 05:28.673
It's not a checkmate.
You cheated!

05:28.731 --> 05:30.802
That's five games to one,
my favor.

05:30.866 --> 05:32.709
That calls
for a congratulatory cigar.

05:35.438 --> 05:38.351
Perhaps this excruciating pain
will be a reminder to you

05:38.407 --> 05:41.581
the next time you and your friends
consider tearing up the estate grounds

05:41.644 --> 05:42.850
with one of your
childish games.

05:42.912 --> 05:45.552
Over-the-line is not a childish
game and I want a cigar!

05:45.615 --> 05:46.787
No, you don't deserve one.

05:46.849 --> 05:48.988
You refuse to employ
the maneuvers I gave you.

05:49.051 --> 05:50.621
Higgins, how am I
supposed to win

05:50.686 --> 05:52.324
if I let you
pick my offenses?

05:52.388 --> 05:55.198
For the last time,
we are not competing.

05:55.558 --> 05:56.901
I desperately need practice

05:56.959 --> 05:59.565
against the favorite attacks
of the grandmasters.

05:59.629 --> 06:02.473
Grandmasters do not
resort to amateurish tricks

06:02.531 --> 06:03.805
like the Rook Blitz!

06:03.866 --> 06:07.211
Castle Blitz. And Uncle Lyle never
lost a game after he came up with...

06:08.371 --> 06:09.907
Aren't you going to answer that?
No.

06:09.972 --> 06:11.713
And I don't recall
the name of Uncle Lyle

06:11.774 --> 06:13.447
in the annals
of world-class play.

06:13.509 --> 06:15.147
Okay, forget it.
Forget it.

06:15.211 --> 06:18.021
I'm just trying to help you win
the tournament, that's all.

06:20.349 --> 06:22.488
<i>Hey, Thomas,
open up the gate.</i>

06:22.551 --> 06:24.326
<i>I've got all the stuff
out here.</i>

06:25.855 --> 06:26.856
What stuff?

06:26.989 --> 06:29.970
<i>The stuff for the party. Didn't
Higgins tell you about it?</i>

06:30.826 --> 06:31.827
Party?

06:32.662 --> 06:34.471
Higgins? What party?

06:34.530 --> 06:37.534
The Hawaiian Islands World Class
Invitational Chess Tournament

06:37.600 --> 06:39.045
Opening Day Reception.

06:39.101 --> 06:41.047
Probably the most important
and prestigious function

06:41.103 --> 06:42.207
I've ever had
the honor to host

06:42.271 --> 06:44.512
and I'll need you to take care
of the last-minute arrangements.

06:44.907 --> 06:46.580
Sir, shall I see
to the front gate?

06:46.642 --> 06:49.054
It's been taken care of. Thank you.
Very good, sir.

06:51.714 --> 06:53.193
Who is that?

06:53.249 --> 06:54.523
James.
He'll announce the guests.

06:54.583 --> 06:56.893
I don't have time to go
into all the details.

06:56.952 --> 06:59.956
Details? You never told me
anything about this!

07:00.022 --> 07:03.595
Due to the fact that I have my
first match in exactly one hour,

07:03.659 --> 07:04.865
and thanks to you,

07:04.927 --> 07:08.568
my final practice session was
wasted on the Uncle Lyle Blitz!

07:08.631 --> 07:11.544
The Castle Blitz and you can make all
the fun of it you want, Higgins,

07:11.600 --> 07:12.977
but you couldn't beat it,
could you?

07:13.035 --> 07:15.276
Only because it was
so idiotically infantile

07:15.338 --> 07:16.874
that it caught me off guard.

07:17.707 --> 07:19.880
Wait! Wait.

07:19.942 --> 07:22.684
Wait, wait, wait... What about
my tickets to Dave Brubeck?

07:22.745 --> 07:24.782
Your wins are invalid.

07:24.847 --> 07:27.521
You were to use maneuvers
of my choice.

07:27.650 --> 07:29.926
Now, if you wish to renegotiate...
Renegotiate?

07:29.985 --> 07:32.226
First it was two out of three,
then it was three out of five...

07:32.288 --> 07:35.098
Hey, Thomas, where do you want the flowers?
In the living room.

07:35.157 --> 07:36.363
Rick will take care
of the catering.

07:36.425 --> 07:38.371
Agatha is coming by to check
the furniture arrangements.

07:38.427 --> 07:39.872
You only have to coordinate
with the harpist,

07:39.929 --> 07:41.636
the extra help
and the parking attendants,

07:41.731 --> 07:44.974
in addition to making certain that
security is absolutely top notch

07:45.034 --> 07:46.672
for the President's arrival.

07:49.605 --> 07:51.812
Did you get the tickets?
I'm working on it.

07:53.709 --> 07:54.949
Higgins!

07:56.779 --> 08:00.022
Higgins, what are you talking about?
What President?

08:00.082 --> 08:02.722
President Manuel lbenez
of Costa de Rosa, of course.

08:02.852 --> 08:05.093
President who of what?
He's here for the tournament.

08:05.154 --> 08:06.224
Of course.

08:06.288 --> 08:08.700
Please complete the reception
preparations by 3:00.

08:08.758 --> 08:11.034
That will give me time to correct
your mistakes after I return.

08:11.093 --> 08:12.970
Higgins, you're not
taking the Ferrari.

08:13.028 --> 08:15.235
I am, after all, the ranking
player on the Island.

08:15.297 --> 08:17.868
It is imperative
that I arrive in style.

08:21.437 --> 08:22.973
What about my tickets?

08:34.350 --> 08:35.658
Jonathan Higgins?

08:36.519 --> 08:38.054
Certainly not.

08:40.389 --> 08:41.890
Thomas Magnum.

08:42.691 --> 08:43.692
Yes.

08:43.826 --> 08:45.806
Well, they told me
that you drove a Ferrari

08:45.861 --> 08:47.863
so I just assumed
that was you.

08:47.930 --> 08:49.773
No, that was someone else.

08:50.633 --> 08:52.340
Let's start all over again.

08:53.436 --> 08:54.779
Alan Johnson.

08:54.837 --> 08:58.979
Aide to President Manuel
lbenez of Costa de Rosa.

08:59.475 --> 09:01.421
I believe that you're
supposed to talk to me

09:01.477 --> 09:03.320
about security here
at Robin's Nest.

09:05.548 --> 09:07.789
Where would you
like to start?

09:21.697 --> 09:24.075
<i>I know. I know.
I was thinking it, too.</i>

09:24.133 --> 09:27.512
<i>Higgins always met with security
people to go over the system</i>

09:27.570 --> 09:29.550
<i>before any visiting dignitary
arrived.</i>

09:29.605 --> 09:31.050
<i>He never drove the Ferrari.</i>

09:31.106 --> 09:34.087
<i>And he would never,
in his wildest dreams,</i>

09:34.143 --> 09:36.248
<i>consider leaving an event
as important as</i>

09:36.312 --> 09:40.783
<i>the Hawaiian Island Whatchamacallit
Reception in mine and Rick's hands.</i>

09:40.850 --> 09:44.627
<i>So something in Higgins' carefully
ordered universe was askew.</i>

09:44.954 --> 09:47.264
<i>And I knew
it was only a matter of time</i>

09:47.356 --> 09:49.199
<i>before I found out
what it was.</i>

09:51.060 --> 09:52.164
<i>In the meantime,</i>

09:52.228 --> 09:54.504
<i>I figured I could be man
enough to overlook the fact</i>

09:54.563 --> 09:56.770
<i>that Higgins had tricked me
into spending my valuable time</i>

09:56.832 --> 09:59.938
<i>with some security expert
from Costa de Rosa.</i>

10:00.336 --> 10:04.409
<i>Especially, if four tickets to the
Dave Brubeck concert were at stake.</i>

10:12.848 --> 10:14.156
Cigar?
No, thanks.

10:16.519 --> 10:18.294
Very capable system.

10:18.854 --> 10:19.855
I'm impressed.

10:21.123 --> 10:24.263
Understand you were with
Naval Intelligence?

10:26.962 --> 10:28.532
You mind if I have one?

10:28.597 --> 10:29.598
Not at all.

10:30.366 --> 10:32.778
I was an army man, myself.
In the CIA.

10:34.136 --> 10:37.777
Well, if there's anything else
you want me to show you, um...

10:38.574 --> 10:40.178
I mean. I'm sure
when you talk to Higgins,

10:40.276 --> 10:42.153
you'll tell him
how thorough I was.

10:42.778 --> 10:44.780
How thorough
the security system is.

10:45.014 --> 10:46.516
I knew that before
I even showed up.

10:46.582 --> 10:47.993
You've got
quite a reputation.

10:48.050 --> 10:50.155
Now, that's one of the reasons
I came to see you.

10:50.219 --> 10:51.630
Do you mind
if I sit down?

10:52.655 --> 10:54.259
No.
Make yourself at home.

10:56.292 --> 10:57.794
How'd you hurt your leg?

10:59.695 --> 11:01.072
It's nothing.

11:01.130 --> 11:02.404
In the war?

11:02.464 --> 11:03.636
<i>No, no.</i>

11:05.501 --> 11:07.139
I don't know about yourself,

11:07.202 --> 11:10.843
but I'm kind of glad to be out
of the intelligence factory.

11:11.874 --> 11:15.014
Got myself a nice, comfortable
job working for a guy I like

11:15.678 --> 11:17.180
in a pretty little place

11:17.246 --> 11:19.385
with clean air,
friendly people.

11:20.149 --> 11:22.026
Sure beats working
for a living.

11:25.955 --> 11:27.491
But you've got a problem.

11:27.890 --> 11:28.925
Uh...

11:28.991 --> 11:30.664
Yeah. I was getting there.

11:31.460 --> 11:32.461
Well,

11:34.029 --> 11:35.906
I don't know what anybody
told you about me,

11:35.965 --> 11:37.308
but I'm not really
very interested

11:37.366 --> 11:39.312
in getting involved
in government cases.

11:40.903 --> 11:42.541
That's why I came to see you.

11:44.340 --> 11:47.344
Three weeks ago,
we set out on a world tour,

11:47.409 --> 11:49.719
kind of a goodwill mission
for Costa de Rosa.

11:50.279 --> 11:52.885
lbenez hates these trips.

11:52.948 --> 11:54.256
But, he knows they're good
for his country.

11:54.316 --> 11:57.058
And he also knew that he could
stop over here in Hawaii

11:57.353 --> 11:59.594
for this big deal
chess tournament.

11:59.655 --> 12:01.999
You know, I don't know anything
about the game myself,

12:02.358 --> 12:04.861
but he's an absolute
nutcase for it.

12:05.628 --> 12:06.971
Anyway, uh...

12:08.897 --> 12:12.310
We received three letters
just like this.

12:15.070 --> 12:17.277
All threats
on the President's life.

12:17.339 --> 12:18.545
All from the same man,

12:18.607 --> 12:22.180
apparently representing
some right wing fringe group.

12:22.244 --> 12:25.748
And all of them promising that
lbenez would meet his destiny here.

12:25.814 --> 12:28.226
Why didn't you cancel
your stopover in Hawaii?

12:30.252 --> 12:32.823
You ever have any dealings
with a chess fanatic?

12:33.455 --> 12:37.062
He wouldn't let anything stop him
from attending this tournament.

12:39.628 --> 12:42.199
Well, you'll have to go to
the authorities with this.

12:42.297 --> 12:45.676
Can't. lbenez
has absolutely forbidden it.

12:47.169 --> 12:49.547
He doesn't believe
the guy is serious,

12:49.638 --> 12:53.643
and he doesn't want to be
perceived as weak or cowardly

12:53.709 --> 12:55.120
by asking for help.

12:57.279 --> 12:58.724
I can't tell him
how to run his life.

12:58.781 --> 13:00.419
But I like the guy,
you know?

13:01.450 --> 13:04.158
I'd sure hate
to see him get hurt.

13:04.219 --> 13:06.631
My people in Costa de Rosa

13:06.689 --> 13:08.464
intercepted
several pieces of mail

13:08.524 --> 13:11.596
all addressed to a post
office box here in Hawaii.

13:12.261 --> 13:16.334
All of them from members of that same
fringe group addressed to their leader.

13:17.266 --> 13:18.540
I'm sure he's here.

13:19.034 --> 13:22.538
We've been watching the place, but
so far the guy hasn't shown up.

13:23.472 --> 13:26.681
And frankly,
I'm running out of time.

13:31.513 --> 13:32.992
Well, suppose...

13:34.750 --> 13:36.730
Just suppose that I find him.

13:37.853 --> 13:39.196
What then?

13:39.688 --> 13:42.931
We turn him over to the proper authorities.
Without fanfare.

13:42.991 --> 13:45.437
Of course,
you'd be well compensated.

13:46.795 --> 13:50.572
Miss Alicia Ravensworth
with the Ali'i Philharmonic.

13:52.401 --> 13:54.677
Excuse me, where do I
put my harp?

13:59.274 --> 14:00.446
I'll see what I can do.

14:01.643 --> 14:03.987
Thank you very much,
I'll find my way out.

14:04.046 --> 14:06.856
<i>Hey, Thomas. You'd
better get in here right away.</i>

14:07.549 --> 14:09.620
Sir, would you like to have...
I was told

14:09.685 --> 14:12.393
there would be someone here
to meet me when I got here...

14:12.454 --> 14:14.024
I understand that...
...and I need to practice...

14:14.089 --> 14:16.330
I need to practice... I don't
know where to put that.

14:16.391 --> 14:18.837
And I need to get
the precise order

14:18.894 --> 14:20.601
in order to
construct...

14:35.144 --> 14:39.092
Well, I'm quite certain it
must have been an oversight.

14:39.248 --> 14:40.522
I don't believe

14:40.582 --> 14:43.995
he would've deliberately
sabotaged you, Jonathan.

14:44.620 --> 14:47.066
Yes, yes. I'll tell him.

14:47.890 --> 14:48.891
Hi.

14:50.292 --> 14:52.966
Oh, Mr. Magnum!
Thank goodness you're here.

14:53.262 --> 14:55.868
I've just had a most
disturbing call from Jonathan.

14:55.931 --> 14:58.275
And you look lovely,
this afternoon, Miss Chumley.

14:58.367 --> 15:00.779
Oh, why... Thank you.

15:01.170 --> 15:03.081
We've a bit of a problem,
I'm afraid.

15:03.138 --> 15:05.550
Nothing that can't be
resolved, I'm sure.

15:05.607 --> 15:07.245
Jonathan's been delayed.

15:07.309 --> 15:09.414
Some problem
with the Ferrari.

15:09.478 --> 15:12.220
A bald tire,
I believe he said.

15:13.115 --> 15:14.788
I meant to take
care of that.

15:14.850 --> 15:17.660
You see? I told him.

15:18.053 --> 15:19.191
At any rate,

15:19.254 --> 15:22.667
he had invited the President of
Costa de Rosa over for drinks

15:22.724 --> 15:25.136
before the rest of the
tournament crowd arrived.

15:25.227 --> 15:27.673
They knew each other
during the war, and...

15:27.729 --> 15:30.676
Oh, I see I'm telling you
more than you need to know.

15:33.168 --> 15:35.205
Sir? Someone to see
Jonathan Higgins.

15:35.270 --> 15:37.682
Oh, dear.
That will be the President.

15:37.739 --> 15:39.150
Don't worry, Agatha.

15:39.241 --> 15:42.120
There is nothing Higgins could have
done that I can't take care of.

15:42.177 --> 15:44.487
Mr. President, I am sorry...

15:45.781 --> 15:47.226
<i>Mr. Presidente?</i>

15:47.983 --> 15:50.987
No, you have mistaken me
for someone else.

15:52.054 --> 15:55.001
I am looking for
my beloved half-brother,

15:55.057 --> 15:56.730
Jonathan Higgins.

15:59.194 --> 16:00.195
Jonathan?

16:01.763 --> 16:02.764
<i>Dios.</i>

16:02.965 --> 16:05.343
Forgive me
for my rude behavior.

16:05.767 --> 16:08.043
Allow me
to introduce myself.

16:08.103 --> 16:09.980
I am Don Luis Mongueo.

16:10.505 --> 16:12.610
The last of the royal line.

16:13.041 --> 16:15.578
Heir to the throne
of Costa de Rosa.

16:30.208 --> 16:32.814
My grandfather
was King Fernando.

16:33.178 --> 16:35.886
The last Mongueo
to rule Costa de Rosa,

16:36.381 --> 16:39.919
massacred by the revolutionaries,
with his entire family

16:40.118 --> 16:43.031
except for my mother,
of course.

16:44.189 --> 16:45.600
Bless you.

16:48.593 --> 16:50.197
Damn plants.

16:55.600 --> 16:56.635
Why's he doing this?

16:56.701 --> 16:58.977
I don't know. But it's
Higgins, all right.

16:59.037 --> 17:01.278
Did you hear that accent?
An obvious phony.

17:01.339 --> 17:04.012
You can practically see
the glue on the goatee.

17:04.075 --> 17:06.612
He better hope that President
lbenez doesn't show up...

17:06.678 --> 17:09.214
lbenez? lbenez, yeah, he
better hope he doesn't show up

17:09.281 --> 17:11.693
while he's doing that phony
imitation of Xavier Cugat.

17:11.750 --> 17:14.560
That could set diplomatic
relations back 20 years.

17:14.618 --> 17:16.428
You're right.

17:16.488 --> 17:19.799
I think it's time for
Don Luis Higgins to retire

17:19.858 --> 17:22.065
before lbenez arrives.

17:22.127 --> 17:24.607
And that, my dears,
is the end of the story.

17:25.096 --> 17:26.097
Fascinating.

17:27.065 --> 17:28.806
Say goodnight, Higgins.

17:30.035 --> 17:31.446
What is the meaning of this?

17:31.503 --> 17:34.347
<i>Buenas noches. Hasta Luego.
Your goatee has slipped.</i>

17:34.406 --> 17:36.886
Unhand me at once!
Ooh!

17:37.075 --> 17:38.986
Good indignation.
That was excellent.

17:39.044 --> 17:41.786
Now if you'll just give me my
four Dave Brubeck tickets...

17:41.846 --> 17:43.120
Magnum!

17:45.183 --> 17:46.457
Higgins.

17:47.085 --> 17:48.689
Jonathan.

17:48.753 --> 17:50.391
Don Luis.
Oh, my God...

17:50.822 --> 17:52.802
Dios mio.
Oh, my God!

17:52.924 --> 17:55.268
The President
of Costa de Rosa,

17:56.628 --> 17:59.336
His Excellency
Manuel lbenez.

17:59.764 --> 18:00.936
lbenez.

18:01.266 --> 18:02.939
Oh, my God.

18:03.735 --> 18:05.646
Manuel...
Jonathan.

18:06.571 --> 18:07.914
<i>Presidente.</i>

18:08.873 --> 18:10.045
Don Luis?

18:14.479 --> 18:16.891
The Juan Garcia Trio.

18:22.354 --> 18:25.062
Juan! Jesus! Julio!

18:25.257 --> 18:27.498
Now, the real music
can begin!

18:31.663 --> 18:33.074
<i>Maravilloso</i>

18:33.131 --> 18:34.872
Come, we need a dance,
Señorita Agatha.

18:34.933 --> 18:36.571
What?

18:39.638 --> 18:42.175
I'm really not good
with Latin steps.

18:42.240 --> 18:45.778
<i>Ah, you're doing it.
Viva! Viva Ia danza.</i>

18:47.479 --> 18:50.119
Oh, dear!
Do not fight it,

18:50.181 --> 18:52.127
our hips have minds
of their own.

18:52.784 --> 18:54.821
Si, sf!

19:02.794 --> 19:05.434
Sorry about the trouble
with the tire,

19:06.097 --> 19:08.407
but at least the party's
a big success.

19:11.603 --> 19:13.879
<i>Viva! Viva!</i>

19:16.808 --> 19:19.721
<i>How could you possibly
have confused him for me?</i>

19:19.778 --> 19:22.918
The bearing, the mannerisms, the
clear-cut difference in character.

19:22.981 --> 19:24.688
Anyone with the slightest
degree of intelligence

19:24.749 --> 19:27.593
and a discerning eye would know
immediately that the man was an imposter.

19:27.652 --> 19:29.495
He's not an imposter,
Higgins.

19:29.554 --> 19:32.034
He told me all along
he was Don Luis Mongueo.

19:32.090 --> 19:36.095
I just didn't realize your father
toured South America in his youth.

19:36.161 --> 19:37.606
Apparently he "toured"
everywhere.

19:37.662 --> 19:39.403
But that is beside
the point.

19:39.464 --> 19:41.341
The point is, between the
flat tire and his arrival,

19:41.399 --> 19:43.709
my reception was an
utter and complete disaster.

19:43.768 --> 19:46.305
Oh, I don't know, I thought it was
kind of touching the way he sang,

19:46.371 --> 19:48.442
<i>Don't Cry For Me,
Costa de Rosa.</i>

19:52.243 --> 19:54.723
Don Luis Mongueo is a national
bad joke in Costa de Rosa

19:54.779 --> 19:57.692
and an insult to President
lbenez and his government.

19:58.049 --> 19:59.926
Until I can decide how best
to return him to his home,

19:59.984 --> 20:02.191
I have asked him not
to leave his room.

20:02.253 --> 20:03.789
Don't you think you're
being a little harsh?

20:03.855 --> 20:05.425
He seemed harmless to me.

20:05.490 --> 20:08.528
This no longer concerns you. You've
made quite a mess out of everything.

20:08.593 --> 20:10.197
Now if you will be kind enough
to leave me alone,

20:10.261 --> 20:12.400
I still have tomorrow
morning's match to attend to.

20:12.464 --> 20:13.704
Okay, okay.

20:16.801 --> 20:17.802
Higgins...

20:19.070 --> 20:20.071
Higgins, you know,

20:21.206 --> 20:24.210
we've been through a lot
together over the years.

20:24.909 --> 20:27.048
And no matter how bad
things have gotten,

20:27.112 --> 20:29.683
no matter how bad they've
gotten I've always known

20:29.748 --> 20:33.594
that I could depend on you to be
a man of honor and integrity.

20:33.651 --> 20:38.031
I mean, you've never
once, never once, not ever,

20:38.757 --> 20:42.295
in all the time I've known
you, gone back on your word.

20:43.461 --> 20:47.409
And that's why I know that
you're going to tell me that...

20:47.465 --> 20:49.604
The tickets have been
given to charity.

20:49.667 --> 20:51.669
No!
Yes!

20:54.038 --> 20:55.039
Goodnight!

21:04.482 --> 21:07.088
You're completely sold out,
huh?

21:07.452 --> 21:10.797
Do you have a waiting list?
Uh-huh. That long, huh?

21:11.689 --> 21:13.999
Well, yeah,
you could put me down.

21:15.293 --> 21:16.567
Come in.

21:17.061 --> 21:18.062
Señor Magnum.

21:18.863 --> 21:21.537
Yeah, four for Thomas Magnum.

21:21.599 --> 21:22.634
Uh-huh.

21:22.700 --> 21:25.203
The day of the concert.
Yeah. Right.

21:25.270 --> 21:27.113
What do you think
my chances are?

21:27.505 --> 21:28.540
Oh...

21:28.606 --> 21:31.109
Well, thanks anyway.

21:31.843 --> 21:35.290
I am interrupting. I will go back...
No, no. That's all right.

21:35.814 --> 21:38.658
You want some pizza? Beer?

21:39.150 --> 21:42.063
You have any sangria?
 I'm all out.

21:42.787 --> 21:43.788
Beer is fine.

21:44.355 --> 21:47.734
I have a cousin who was born with
one leg shorter than the other.

21:48.159 --> 21:51.333
He overcame his limp to become a
world renowned flamenco dancer.

21:51.396 --> 21:53.342
Oh. This, uh...

21:53.631 --> 21:56.578
It's the war. I don't like to
talk about it.

21:57.235 --> 21:58.339
Ah.

21:59.003 --> 22:02.917
My brother, Jonathan, has
done very well for himself

22:02.974 --> 22:05.011
to be living
in such a place, yes?

22:05.076 --> 22:06.453
Yeah, I guess so.

22:10.648 --> 22:14.619
It's important to me to learn
as much about him as I can.

22:15.587 --> 22:18.568
Brothers, after all,
should be brothers.

22:18.623 --> 22:21.570
Without family,
there is nothing.

22:22.227 --> 22:23.399
Uh, Don Luis...

22:23.461 --> 22:25.566
You think I am being
overly sentimental.

22:26.064 --> 22:27.065
No.

22:29.033 --> 22:30.706
Perhaps, being an orphan,

22:30.768 --> 22:33.271
I am more sensitive to
these matters than most.

22:36.574 --> 22:40.647
You know, there are those, who
do not believe that my mother,

22:41.913 --> 22:45.258
the lovely Dona Ana,
survived the massacre.

22:48.353 --> 22:51.664
Yeah, I had heard there was
some discrepancies.

22:53.858 --> 22:57.897
Some day I intend to restore
the good name of Mongueo

22:57.962 --> 23:00.238
in the hearts
of my countrymen.

23:00.298 --> 23:03.541
But for now, it is my brother
I am interested in.

23:05.436 --> 23:06.471
Well,

23:06.538 --> 23:09.075
I think if there's something you
want to know about Higgins,

23:09.140 --> 23:10.414
you should ask him.

23:10.475 --> 23:11.647
I have.

23:12.610 --> 23:14.817
Unfortunately, he is...

23:14.879 --> 23:16.119
Stubborn.

23:18.149 --> 23:21.790
Proud.
I expected no less of him.

23:23.187 --> 23:26.293
But one day, I hope to melt
the ice barrier between us

23:26.357 --> 23:29.031
that keeps us both
isolated and alone.

23:29.961 --> 23:36.901
I will, how you say, come
clean with you, Mr. Magnum.

23:37.268 --> 23:39.509
Thomas.
Tomas!

23:40.104 --> 23:42.414
I came here tonight
to hire you.

23:44.876 --> 23:46.048
Hire me?

23:47.545 --> 23:52.187
Teach me this game which so occupies
my brother's heart and mind.

23:52.951 --> 23:54.089
Chess?

23:55.520 --> 23:58.433
To tell you the truth, I really
don't know much about it.

23:58.489 --> 24:01.959
Perhaps through this game
I can find a way to bring

24:02.026 --> 24:04.336
the Mongueos and the
Higginses back together.

24:08.333 --> 24:11.473
I could teach you
my Uncle Lyle's Castle Blitz.

24:12.337 --> 24:13.714
Prepare the board.

24:13.771 --> 24:17.776
And damned be he who first
cries, <i>basta!</i> No más!

24:20.311 --> 24:22.313
Damn plants.
Bless you.

24:25.717 --> 24:28.425
<i>Something I've
discovered living in Paradise.</i>

24:28.486 --> 24:31.490
<i>You can't really hold onto
resentment very long.</i>

24:31.589 --> 24:35.332
<i>Sure, I was annoyed at Higgins for not
giving me the tickets to the concert.</i>

24:36.127 --> 24:38.607
<i>But, there would be
other concerts.</i>

24:42.166 --> 24:45.978
<i>In the meantime, I guess I had a
client and a lead to follow up on.</i>

24:47.438 --> 24:49.975
<i>There had been four
threatening letters to lbenez</i>

24:50.041 --> 24:53.022
<i>all with the same
post office box numbers.</i>

24:53.077 --> 24:56.422
<i>His security chief, Alan Johnson, had
been unable to get the name and address</i>

24:56.481 --> 24:58.927
<i>of the person
who had rented that box.</i>

25:10.161 --> 25:11.401
Anybody there?

25:13.698 --> 25:14.699
Hello?

25:17.101 --> 25:19.206
Yeah?
Hi.

25:20.605 --> 25:24.678
I need to change the address
on my post office box.

25:24.742 --> 25:26.915
It's number AJ 8085.

25:29.547 --> 25:33.154
I'm sorry I didn't know anybody
was standing right there.

25:35.286 --> 25:37.459
This month's box rent is late.

25:37.922 --> 25:38.923
Oh.

25:39.724 --> 25:42.705
I thought I'd paid that one...
How much was that, again?

25:43.127 --> 25:45.937
Fifteen dollars
and thirty-five cents.

25:46.698 --> 25:47.802
Fifteen...

25:50.535 --> 25:51.843
There you go.

25:53.905 --> 25:57.682
Just cross out your previous address
and write the new one on the back.

25:57.975 --> 25:59.249
Right, yeah.

26:04.949 --> 26:05.950
There you are.

26:08.619 --> 26:09.620
Thank you.

26:10.521 --> 26:12.592
What happened
to your leg?

26:21.132 --> 26:24.636
What makes you think there's
something wrong with my leg?

26:24.836 --> 26:27.282
Did it ever occur to you
that maybe, just maybe,

26:27.338 --> 26:28.510
I don't want to
talk about it?

26:28.573 --> 26:30.644
That it might just bring up
unhappy memories?

26:30.708 --> 26:33.587
Or that I'm just plain sick
and tired of everybody I meet

26:33.644 --> 26:36.955
asking me, "What happened to your
leg?" Did that ever occur to you?

26:40.785 --> 26:42.389
Have a nice day.

26:42.453 --> 26:46.299
<i>I was beginning to think
that fate was definitely on my side.</i>

26:46.357 --> 26:47.961
<i>Not only in getting
even with Higgins</i>

26:48.025 --> 26:50.005
<i>but with finding
the assassin.</i>

26:50.061 --> 26:52.473
<i>I mean, I was almost embarrassed
to have to tell Johnson</i>

26:52.530 --> 26:54.703
<i>how easy it had been to get
the address of the man</i>

26:54.766 --> 26:57.269
<i>who had rented
the post office box number.</i>

27:09.380 --> 27:12.020
<i>And the way the guy had left
his things in his room,</i>

27:12.116 --> 27:15.495
<i>he'd made finding out his identity
embarrassingly simple as well.</i>

27:15.953 --> 27:19.298
<i>I no longer thought fate
was on my side, I knew it.</i>

27:20.424 --> 27:22.665
<i>But then fate has ways of
reminding you</i>

27:22.727 --> 27:25.731
<i>that it's never as easy
as it seems.</i>

27:43.248 --> 27:44.750
Don Luis?

27:47.952 --> 27:49.522
Higgins?

27:51.689 --> 27:53.464
Higgins. Where's Don Luis?
He's gone.

27:53.524 --> 27:55.003
Where did he go?
When will he be back?

27:55.059 --> 27:56.732
I don't know and he won't.

27:56.794 --> 27:58.000
What?

27:58.529 --> 28:00.133
Higgins! This is important!

28:00.197 --> 28:02.143
I informed him that
he had to leave. He did.

28:02.199 --> 28:03.940
I have my second match
in 25 minutes

28:04.001 --> 28:05.571
and I do not intend
to waste any of them

28:05.636 --> 28:07.479
on further, pointless
discussion of Don Luis.

28:07.538 --> 28:09.040
But he could be
in serious trouble.

28:09.106 --> 28:11.086
Then that, I'm afraid,
is his problem.

28:18.349 --> 28:20.920
<i>...certainly this is
one of the most popular matches</i>

28:20.985 --> 28:22.487
<i>of the second day
of the tournament.</i>

28:23.254 --> 28:27.464
<i>The winner will emerge as one of the
overall leaders in the standings.</i>

28:27.925 --> 28:29.734
Come on, Laurie,
it should be easy.

28:29.793 --> 28:33.002
I can't get off early tomorrow, Rick.
Rules are rules.

28:33.063 --> 28:34.167
Look, Laurie,

28:34.231 --> 28:36.472
my buddy has got tickets to
the Dave Brubeck concert.

28:36.533 --> 28:38.012
I mean, everything's
all set up.

28:38.068 --> 28:40.571
Can't you just talk to
your manager or something?

28:40.638 --> 28:42.413
Look, I'll try. Okay?

28:42.473 --> 28:44.009
Oh. That's great, baby.

28:44.708 --> 28:45.948
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

28:46.010 --> 28:48.149
Rick.
What took you so long?

28:48.212 --> 28:51.022
I thought I asked you to keep an
eye on Higgins till I got here.

28:51.081 --> 28:52.253
I am. He's right there.

28:52.316 --> 28:54.990
The hotel put monitors in here so we
could watch the chess tournament.

28:55.052 --> 28:57.157
Pretty good idea, huh?
Oh, yeah.

28:58.389 --> 29:03.099
Listen, I got to talk
to you about...

29:03.160 --> 29:04.537
What's he doing?

29:04.595 --> 29:06.768
Playing chess.
I know that...

29:07.698 --> 29:10.110
<i>Tilden is studying the
board in bewilderment. He's...</i>

29:10.567 --> 29:11.671
What's going on?

29:11.735 --> 29:12.975
That's what I'd like to know.

29:13.037 --> 29:15.916
<i>He's acknowledging checkmate.
The official is checking and...</i>

29:15.973 --> 29:18.317
<i>Yes, checkmate!
Extraordinary!</i>

29:18.375 --> 29:20.616
<i>Jonathan Higgins has set
a new tournament record.</i>

29:20.678 --> 29:22.589
<i>Checkmate in seven moves!</i>

29:22.646 --> 29:24.091
He won in seven moves!

29:24.148 --> 29:26.856
That's the Castle Blitz.
I got to find Higgins.

29:26.917 --> 29:28.055
He's right there, Thomas.

29:28.118 --> 29:29.563
No, I don't have time
to explain right now.

29:29.620 --> 29:31.657
Stay here and keep an eye on Don Luis.
It's real important.

29:31.722 --> 29:33.030
Don't let him
out of your sight.

29:33.090 --> 29:34.194
Where is he?

29:34.258 --> 29:36.795
He's taking a bow. And don't
let him see you either.

29:37.294 --> 29:39.433
<i>From his
incredible accomplishment.</i>

29:43.167 --> 29:46.410
That's Higgins, isn't it?
Thomas? Th...

29:48.472 --> 29:52.113
<i>All right, maybe Higgins had
been acting very unlike Higgins lately.</i>

29:52.176 --> 29:53.780
<i>But one thing
I knew for sure,</i>

29:53.844 --> 29:55.881
<i>he would never resort
to using a trick</i>

29:55.946 --> 29:58.256
<i>like Uncle Lyle's
Castle Blitz,</i>

29:58.315 --> 30:01.296
<i>especially with the entire
chess world watching.</i>

30:03.887 --> 30:05.127
Higgins!

30:09.426 --> 30:11.030
Higgins!

30:13.030 --> 30:14.100
You in there?

30:26.243 --> 30:27.244
Higgins?

30:30.564 --> 30:31.838
Higgins, you up there?

30:34.167 --> 30:35.874
<i>Which meant only one thing,</i>

30:35.936 --> 30:38.439
<i>that the Higgins at the chess
tournament wasn't really Higgins.</i>

30:38.505 --> 30:40.007
<i>He was Don Luis.</i>

30:40.073 --> 30:42.644
<i>Which solved the problem
of where Don Luis was.</i>

30:42.709 --> 30:45.986
<i>And that left me with only
one tripartite question.</i>

30:46.046 --> 30:49.084
<i>Who was Don Luis and why was
he doing all these things.</i>

30:49.149 --> 30:51.151
<i>And where
had he stashed Higgins?</i>

30:52.252 --> 30:53.356
Higgins?

31:06.833 --> 31:09.336
Higgins, what happened?

31:10.337 --> 31:13.511
How could I look for you when I
didn't know you were missing?

31:15.275 --> 31:17.778
I'm going as fast as I can.

31:19.446 --> 31:22.290
I don't know, it seemed more likely
you'd be in the house somewhere.

31:22.382 --> 31:24.692
Any investigator
worth his salt

31:24.751 --> 31:27.027
would have thought
to look here first.

31:34.861 --> 31:35.862
Higgins!

31:36.730 --> 31:38.801
I can't talk now, I'm two
hours late for my match.

31:38.865 --> 31:40.003
I can only throw myself
You won.

31:40.067 --> 31:42.479
On the mercy of the judges and...
You won!

31:43.704 --> 31:45.183
In seven moves.

31:45.572 --> 31:46.676
Seven.

31:46.740 --> 31:49.346
Don Luis disguised himself
as you and won the match.

31:51.144 --> 31:52.817
The Uncle Lyle Blitz!

31:52.879 --> 31:54.290
The Castle Blitz...

31:54.347 --> 31:56.224
Never mind that right now.

31:58.785 --> 32:00.264
I've been disgraced.

32:00.687 --> 32:02.462
You sneezed.

32:02.522 --> 32:04.729
What of it?
It's very dusty in there.

32:06.293 --> 32:08.034
Stop that. What in God's
name are you doing?

32:08.095 --> 32:10.200
I'm sorry, but there's something
I have to talk to you about.

32:10.263 --> 32:13.301
Something very important and I can't
do it until I can be sure who you are.

32:13.366 --> 32:15.744
Don't be ridiculous. You
know perfectly well who I...

32:18.238 --> 32:20.377
Tell me a story.
The Gunga Din story.

32:20.440 --> 32:22.681
For God's sake, Magnum
this is hardly the time.

32:22.743 --> 32:24.984
If you're Higgins,
anytime is the time.

32:25.045 --> 32:27.491
<i>The Gunga Din story now.</i>

32:30.951 --> 32:32.225
Malaysia, 1943.

32:32.285 --> 32:34.788
Our regiment was hopelessly outnumbered,
and we faced certain death.

32:34.855 --> 32:36.857
In our ranks was a young
Lieutenant Ian Bowerly,

32:36.923 --> 32:39.062
and during the lull in the
battle he recited, Gunga <i>Din.</i>

32:39.126 --> 32:41.538
I suppose to keep up our courage
for facing the inevitable,

32:41.595 --> 32:43.541
his eloquent recitation
grew increasingly louder,

32:43.597 --> 32:45.201
until it thundered
through the jungle.

32:45.265 --> 32:47.108
To our amazement, the Japanese
troops walked forward.

32:47.167 --> 32:49.272
Though they spoke no English
they were entranced by the poem.

32:49.336 --> 32:52.249
They allowed us all to leave the area
unharmed except for poor Mr. Bowerly.

32:52.305 --> 32:55.149
As we made our escape, we could hear
him reciting other Kipling favorites,

32:55.208 --> 32:56.278
literally for miles.

32:56.343 --> 32:57.913
To this day,
his fate remains unknown.

32:57.978 --> 32:59.548
Thank you. I believe
your half-brother

32:59.613 --> 33:02.753
is going to assassinate the
President of Costa de Rosa.

33:07.420 --> 33:09.525
An extraordinary performance.

33:10.056 --> 33:12.263
I've followed tournament play
for many years.

33:12.325 --> 33:16.603
Never have I seen such audacity
as to use a child's move.

33:17.330 --> 33:20.368
The "rook-flank entrapment"
as you call it.

33:20.433 --> 33:22.936
I must admit you have created
quite a stir here, today.

33:23.069 --> 33:25.743
Yes, well, I knew
it would only work once

33:25.806 --> 33:29.583
so I used it against
my most formidable opponent.

33:29.643 --> 33:32.852
I'm quite certain that the entire
chess world will be debating

33:32.913 --> 33:36.861
such a show of style versus
content for many years to come.

33:37.117 --> 33:39.154
Excuse me, Mr. President.
You wanted to freshen up

33:39.219 --> 33:41.256
for the reception here
at the hotel this evening.

33:41.321 --> 33:42.925
Yes. Thank you, Alan.

33:43.757 --> 33:45.964
Thank you for
a most enjoyable afternoon.

33:46.026 --> 33:47.835
I should freshen up as well.

33:47.894 --> 33:50.465
Perhaps you'd like to have
a drink in my quarters

33:50.564 --> 33:53.272
and discuss the "rook-flank"
in more detail.

33:53.333 --> 33:55.745
Oh, no, no. I am only
a very interested amateur.

33:55.802 --> 33:58.942
But even I, my friend,
have already mastered

33:59.005 --> 34:02.350
all the details of
the "rook-flank entrapment."

34:15.255 --> 34:17.496
Sixth floor, please.

34:35.909 --> 34:38.047
I'll see you later,
Mr. President.

34:38.110 --> 34:39.454
Certainly, Jonathan.

34:49.556 --> 34:50.967
In an hour, Johnson.

35:11.411 --> 35:15.325
"My lineage being what
it is, of royal stock and origin

35:15.382 --> 35:19.421
"has naturally made me something
of an outcast in my own country."

35:19.486 --> 35:21.159
You're not going
to find any clue

35:21.221 --> 35:23.201
in a book
he just left lying around.

35:23.256 --> 35:25.497
Perhaps, further back. Clearly,
anything of interest to us

35:25.558 --> 35:27.299
is going to be found
in his locked suitcase.

35:27.360 --> 35:28.600
If you would help me
with the lock.

35:28.662 --> 35:30.642
"Should I fail in my attempt

35:30.697 --> 35:33.473
"to thwart the evildoers who
plot against my country..."

35:33.533 --> 35:35.012
I don't see why
you won't pick this lock.

35:35.068 --> 35:37.048
You do it for anyone else
at the drop of a hat.

35:37.103 --> 35:40.084
"...a conspiracy to murder
our Great President

35:40.140 --> 35:42.586
"led by his trusted servant,
Alan Johnson."

35:42.642 --> 35:43.746
This is it, Higgins.

35:43.810 --> 35:46.723
He did leave this
for us to find. Now, listen.

35:46.780 --> 35:49.056
"In the event of my death
for I am quite certain

35:49.115 --> 35:52.426
"that Johnson knows I am onto
his plot to plant a bomb

35:52.485 --> 35:54.487
"in His Excellency's car

35:54.554 --> 35:56.693
"my only hope is to be
remembered by my countrymen

35:56.756 --> 35:57.928
"as a patriot and a hero."

35:57.991 --> 36:00.938
Do you think it's possible he's setting
up Alan Johnson to take a fall?

36:00.994 --> 36:03.736
You've spent time with him. How would
you describe Don Luis Mongueo?

36:03.797 --> 36:05.105
Romantic. An idealist.

36:05.165 --> 36:08.169
Exactly. The worst he could be accused
of is murdering the English language.

36:08.234 --> 36:10.544
I don't think he would
entrap anyone unfairly.

36:10.603 --> 36:14.312
Yes! So we have to assume that he's
going to try and stop Johnson.

36:14.374 --> 36:17.548
That's why he disguised himself as you
and went to the chess tournament.

36:17.610 --> 36:19.351
Here, let me take
a look at that.

36:32.859 --> 36:34.532
Photographs of me.

36:37.230 --> 36:39.767
These look like blow-ups from the
negatives I found in the dark room.

36:39.833 --> 36:42.336
He's been doing a character
study of you, Higgins.

36:46.539 --> 36:48.712
And not a bad idea, at that.

37:21.574 --> 37:24.214
Thank God for my amateur
theatrical background.

37:24.277 --> 37:25.654
Does this look all right?

37:25.712 --> 37:27.316
Why are you doing this?

37:27.380 --> 37:29.621
Because Don Luis
is impersonating me

37:29.682 --> 37:31.491
and if he's right, we don't
want to blow his cover.

37:31.551 --> 37:32.791
Of course.

37:32.852 --> 37:34.297
Now, I'll try to draw
Johnson away

37:34.354 --> 37:37.233
while you convince Don Luis to turn
this matter over to the authorities.

37:37.290 --> 37:41.204
I cannot believe
I didn't see this right away.

37:41.628 --> 37:42.936
There was no way
you could have known.

37:42.996 --> 37:44.202
He is a consummate
professional.

37:44.264 --> 37:45.436
He had us all fooled.

37:45.498 --> 37:46.943
No, but leading...

37:47.467 --> 37:50.073
Leading me to that address and
from there to the boarding house.

37:50.136 --> 37:51.615
It was all too easy.

37:51.671 --> 37:53.947
Of course with my training and
perhaps more to the point,

37:54.007 --> 37:56.146
the same genetic makeup
as it were,

37:56.209 --> 37:57.483
I should have been
alerted the moment

37:57.544 --> 38:01.082
he appeared as an overly
flamboyant popinjay. Popinjay?

38:01.147 --> 38:04.151
Dandy, coxcomb, fop. I should
have realized immediately

38:04.217 --> 38:07.061
that he was playing a role,
misdirecting us.

38:07.120 --> 38:09.396
You're not talking about
Alan Johnson.

38:09.489 --> 38:12.732
I am talking about
El Mongueo.

38:13.426 --> 38:15.167
Your goatee is crooked.

38:22.869 --> 38:24.849
Would you like to have them
removed, Jonathan?

38:24.904 --> 38:26.383
What?
The flowers.

38:26.439 --> 38:28.316
Would you like to have them
removed from the table?

38:28.374 --> 38:29.853
They seem to be
a problem for you.

38:29.909 --> 38:31.980
No, no.
I just have a cold.

38:32.178 --> 38:33.555
We should be leaving.

38:34.481 --> 38:36.552
Yes, of course.
Excuse me, Jonathan.

38:36.616 --> 38:39.460
Leaving? To go where?

38:39.619 --> 38:43.123
I'm afraid I can't be totally
unofficial while I'm here.

38:43.356 --> 38:45.768
A quick courtesy visit
to your Governor.

38:45.825 --> 38:49.398
Oh, I'm gonna have to meet you
at the car, Mr. Presidente.

38:49.462 --> 38:51.942
The gift you were going to give to
the Governor I left in my room.

38:51.998 --> 38:53.272
Yes, of course.

38:53.399 --> 38:55.504
The limousine will be
at the side entrance.

38:55.568 --> 38:56.740
Five minutes.

39:07.080 --> 39:09.754
Jonathan, as always,
a great pleasure.

39:09.816 --> 39:11.022
Mr. President.

39:14.154 --> 39:15.462
Excuse me.

39:33.039 --> 39:36.384
Rickey! He said it's okay!
What?

39:36.442 --> 39:38.080
Margie's gonna
fill in for me.

39:38.144 --> 39:39.589
What're you talking about?

39:39.646 --> 39:41.990
The Dave Brubeck concert.
Are we going or not?

39:42.048 --> 39:44.460
Oh, great. Yeah,
that's not a problem.

39:44.517 --> 39:46.326
Hey, what have you
done to your hair?

39:46.386 --> 39:49.265
It's part of my disguise. Look,
I can't talk to you right now.

39:52.158 --> 39:54.001
Great, just great.

39:58.331 --> 39:59.503
Rick.

40:02.168 --> 40:03.977
You might've told me
you found Don Luis.

40:04.037 --> 40:05.209
This isn't Don Luis.

40:05.271 --> 40:06.682
No, it most certainly is not.

40:06.739 --> 40:07.740
Higgins?

40:07.974 --> 40:09.385
Where's Don Luis?

40:10.076 --> 40:11.749
He followed lbenez
to his room,

40:11.811 --> 40:13.950
came back down here,
then lbenez left again.

40:14.013 --> 40:15.151
Left? To go where?

40:15.215 --> 40:17.354
To his limo,
at the side entrance.

40:17.417 --> 40:18.452
With Johnson?

40:18.518 --> 40:21.328
Thomas, that's the weird part. Johnson
disappeared into that stairwell,

40:21.387 --> 40:23.196
and then Don Luis
followed him.

40:24.224 --> 40:26.295
I'll check on the roof.
I'll try to intercept lbenez.

40:26.526 --> 40:29.132
Thomas,
Thomas!

40:42.141 --> 40:44.644
Johnson! Johnson!

40:46.145 --> 40:48.318
Show yourself
if you are a man!

40:48.381 --> 40:51.453
Fight this battle in the open
where you can be seen!

41:04.030 --> 41:05.373
Johnson!

41:44.637 --> 41:46.241
Get in the car.

41:52.512 --> 41:56.983
Presidente! There's a bomb!
Run! A bomb! Quickly!

42:15.301 --> 42:17.872
I'm all right, thank you.
Thank you. I'm all right.

42:18.204 --> 42:20.844
The assassin has failed,
Presidente.

42:21.174 --> 42:23.780
Don Luis Mongueo
has saved you.

42:23.843 --> 42:25.481
I am your humblest
servant.

42:26.279 --> 42:28.259
No, you are my friend,
Don Luis.

42:28.314 --> 42:30.555
You saved my life.
Thank you.

42:37.357 --> 42:39.633
That goatee looks
as good as your real one.

42:40.093 --> 42:41.629
Jonathan is letting me
borrow it

42:41.694 --> 42:43.298
since I had to
shave mine off.

42:43.796 --> 42:49.041
I wouldn't want to return home
unmasked, uh, so to speak.

42:49.135 --> 42:51.581
It's so terribly exciting.

42:51.771 --> 42:54.047
Going home
to a hero's welcome.

42:54.107 --> 42:59.113
Yes. A very generous gesture
on Presidente lbenez's part,

42:59.545 --> 43:03.118
however, I must confess
both to him and Jonathan,

43:04.016 --> 43:07.395
I am no hero
and cannot accept the honor.

43:07.653 --> 43:09.655
Of course you're a hero.

43:10.523 --> 43:13.265
I'm afraid events
proved otherwise.

43:13.626 --> 43:15.162
What're you
talking about?

43:17.630 --> 43:19.473
You don't remember
disarming Johnson?

43:21.401 --> 43:22.402
I?

43:22.502 --> 43:24.675
After the bomb went off,
Johnson pulled a gun.

43:24.737 --> 43:26.216
Yeah, you don't
remember this?

43:27.340 --> 43:28.341
No.

43:28.608 --> 43:30.144
He was going to
shoot lbenez.

43:30.209 --> 43:32.086
You jumped him, you wrestled
the gun away from him,

43:32.145 --> 43:35.024
without any regard whatsoever
for your own personal safety.

43:35.081 --> 43:37.027
Thomas had to hold you back.

43:37.083 --> 43:39.029
You were willing to give up
your own life for your country.

43:39.085 --> 43:41.292
I can't think of a better
definition of a hero.

43:43.756 --> 43:45.201
I don't recall.

43:46.359 --> 43:47.895
Must've been the hit on the head.
Mmm-hmm.

43:47.960 --> 43:49.132
Temporary amnesia.

43:51.898 --> 43:53.571
Your car is ready.

44:00.706 --> 44:02.549
You'll come to visit again?

44:02.608 --> 44:04.315
You must come to visit me.

44:04.977 --> 44:06.786
I want to show you
that Mongueo hospitality

44:06.846 --> 44:09.486
is not so different
from Higgins' hospitality.

44:10.116 --> 44:12.062
<i>Viva</i> Costa de Rosa.

44:12.118 --> 44:14.291
<i>Viva</i> Albert Stanley Higgins.

44:15.521 --> 44:16.966
Hear, hear.

44:28.201 --> 44:29.976
Adios, Mr. Magnum.

44:30.203 --> 44:31.204
Tomas.

44:32.405 --> 44:34.510
Tomas.

44:40.379 --> 44:42.757
Higgins? Aren't you going
to see him out?

44:44.350 --> 44:45.351
Hmm?

44:45.818 --> 44:49.789
Oh, um, no. No. I promised
to demonstrate to Agatha

44:50.056 --> 44:53.868
the brilliant chess maneuver I had
planned to use at the tournament.

44:54.694 --> 44:56.503
Oh. Incidentally,

44:56.562 --> 44:59.133
I carelessly forgot to send
these concert tickets off

44:59.198 --> 45:01.906
to the charity organization
as I had intended.

45:01.968 --> 45:03.345
Since the concert
is this evening,

45:03.402 --> 45:05.712
it is far too late
to send them now.

45:07.540 --> 45:09.577
If you would like to use them.

45:13.145 --> 45:14.590
You sure you're all right?

45:14.647 --> 45:15.819
Quite.

45:20.186 --> 45:21.824
Damn plants!
