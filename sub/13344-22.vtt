WEBVTT

00:05.673 --> 00:08.509
Male voice:
PREVIOUSLY ON
"IN TREATMENT"...

00:08.609 --> 00:09.877
I SLEPT WITH HER, OKAY?

00:09.977 --> 00:13.547
BUT I'M SURE YOU GOT
A FULL PLAY-BY-PLAY
FROM HER ALREADY.

00:13.647 --> 00:15.816
AFTER WE HAD SEX,
SHE STRADDLES MY LEG.

00:15.916 --> 00:17.951
SHE STARTS RUBBING UP
AGAINST ME.

00:18.052 --> 00:19.887
IT'S SO OBVIOUS
SHE'S COMPLETELY

00:19.987 --> 00:22.090
AND TOTALLY HUNG UP
ON SOMEONE ELSE.

00:22.190 --> 00:25.226
EVER HEARD OF VERTIGO?
WHEN YOU GO INTO VERTIGO,

00:25.326 --> 00:27.228
YOU LOOK ONLY AT YOUR
AIRCRAFT'S INSTRUMENTS.

00:27.328 --> 00:30.598
BUT KEEPING MY EYES
ON MY INSTRUMENTS IS
WHAT GOT ME HERE.

00:30.698 --> 00:32.833
BECAUSE I KEPT MY EYES
ON MY INSTRUMENTS,

00:32.933 --> 00:36.704
I DROPPED THAT BOMB
SO ACCURATELY, I KILLED
INNOCENT PEOPLE.

00:36.804 --> 00:39.307
WHAT'S THE FIRST
STEP ON THE WAY
TO MY NEW LIFE?

00:39.407 --> 00:41.109
WHAT WOULD YOU
LIKE TO DO?

00:41.209 --> 00:43.577
I THINK I'LL GO
FUCK HER AGAIN.

00:44.745 --> 00:46.547
YEAH.

00:48.582 --> 00:51.719
Woman:
Flight 810
estimated time of arrival:

00:51.819 --> 00:53.654
9:55 a.m.

00:53.754 --> 00:55.489
Flight 323

00:55.589 --> 00:59.227
estimated time
of arrival: 11:05 a.m.

00:59.327 --> 01:01.229
- Flight 111--
- ( knock on door )

01:01.329 --> 01:04.098
--estimated time
of arrival: 12:21 p.m.

01:04.198 --> 01:07.168
HEY, AM I EARLY AGAIN?

01:07.268 --> 01:10.003
NO NO NO, YOU'RE FINE.
COME ON IN.

01:10.104 --> 01:13.374
- FINISH WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
I'LL MAKE SOME COFFEE.
- NO, IT'S OKAY.

01:13.474 --> 01:15.643
YOU'RE FINE.

01:17.578 --> 01:19.247
"THE RAIN IN SPAIN

01:19.347 --> 01:21.882
FALLS MAINLY
ON THE PLAIN."

01:21.982 --> 01:23.684
THAT'S BULLSHIT,
YOU KNOW.

01:23.784 --> 01:27.188
I'VE BEEN TO SPAIN,
AND THE RAIN IN THE PYRENEES
IS A BITCH.

01:27.288 --> 01:30.124
( theme music playing )

01:45.539 --> 01:48.542
SO I'LL OPEN
WITH THE PUNCHLINE, DOC:

01:48.642 --> 01:49.877
I BROKE UP WITH LAURA.

01:49.977 --> 01:52.346
I WAS ACTUALLY A PRETTY
GREAT FUCK THE SECOND TIME.

01:52.446 --> 01:55.048
I DRANK ABOUT A HALF
BOTTLE OF STOLI

01:55.149 --> 01:56.684
JUST TO RELAX.

01:56.784 --> 01:59.153
I ALSO TOOK A PILL THAT
DANIEL GAVE ME, YOU KNOW,

01:59.253 --> 02:01.222
ONE OF THOSE.

02:01.322 --> 02:05.058
I HAD A HARD-ON
FOR A DAY AND A HALF, PAUL.

02:05.159 --> 02:06.860
YOU SHOULD
TRY IT SOMETIME.

02:06.960 --> 02:08.796
IT'S A LITTLE STRANGE,
THOUGH.

02:08.896 --> 02:12.099
IT'S LIKE A WOODY THAT
ACTUALLY FEELS LIKE WOOD

02:12.200 --> 02:14.702
'CAUSE IT'S JUST SITTING
UP THERE AND MINDING
HIS OWN BUSINESS

02:14.802 --> 02:16.937
LIKE IT'S GOT NOTHING
TO DO WITH YOU.

02:17.037 --> 02:18.972
WORKS LIKE A CHARM,
THOUGH.

02:19.072 --> 02:21.509
ANYWAY, I MADE UP
FOR THE LAST TIME.

02:21.609 --> 02:23.311
WE WERE FUCKING.

02:23.411 --> 02:26.146
ALL NIGHT LONG,
IN THE MORNING TOO.

02:26.247 --> 02:28.749
IN THE END
I REALIZED THAT

02:28.849 --> 02:31.952
SHE WAS JUST USING ME.
SHE REALLY WASN'T
WITH ME.

02:32.052 --> 02:34.855
SHE WAS JUST USING ME
FOR AN EXCUSE,

02:34.955 --> 02:37.391
YOU KNOW?

02:39.327 --> 02:42.430
YEAH, AT ANY RATE,
IT'S OVER.

02:42.530 --> 02:44.498
IT'S REALLY NOT GONNA GO
ANYWHERE FROM HERE.

02:44.598 --> 02:46.800
EXCUSE ME, YOU KNOW,
WHEN YOU SAY "FROM HERE,"
FORGIVE ME,

02:46.900 --> 02:49.603
- BUT DO YOU MEAN
FROM THIS OFFICE?
- WHAT?

02:49.703 --> 02:53.641
ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY
THAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP
WITH LAURA

02:53.741 --> 02:55.609
HAS SOMETHING TO DO
WITH WHAT GOES ON
IN THIS OFFICE?

02:55.709 --> 02:57.745
HAVE YOU COMPLETELY
LOST YOUR MIND?

02:57.845 --> 03:00.648
WHAT ARE YOU GRASPING
AT NOW, A WORD?

03:00.748 --> 03:03.917
NO, IT'S JUST THAT YOU'RE
ALWAYS TRYING TO MAKE THIS
BIZARRE CONNECTION

03:04.017 --> 03:05.919
BETWEEN YOU, ME
AND LAURA.

03:06.019 --> 03:08.589
IS IT ME? 'CAUSE YOU'RE
THE ONE ALWAYS MAKING
A BIG DEAL OUT OF IT.

03:19.032 --> 03:22.570
TELL ME SOMETHING DIDN'T
HAPPEN BETWEEN YOU AND HER.

03:22.670 --> 03:25.473
WHAT?

03:25.573 --> 03:29.510
YOU'RE ASKING ME TO TELL
YOU WHAT DIDN'T HAPPEN?

03:29.610 --> 03:31.512
YEAH, I'M ASKING.
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN
BETWEEN YOU TWO OR NOT?

03:31.612 --> 03:34.448
YOU MEAN APART
FROM THERAPY?

03:34.548 --> 03:36.584
JESUS,
LOOK AT YOU DANCE.
IT'S A SIMPLE QUESTION.

03:36.684 --> 03:39.320
YOUR MILLION-DOLLAR
TECHNIQUE,

03:39.420 --> 03:41.322
ANSWERING A QUESTION
WITH A QUESTION.

03:41.422 --> 03:42.556
WELL, IT AIN'T GONNA
FLY THIS TIME.

03:42.656 --> 03:45.225
I'LL TELL YOU
WHY I'M ASKING.

03:45.326 --> 03:47.328
EVERY TIME WE WERE TOGETHER,
HALF THE TIME

03:47.428 --> 03:48.896
SHE TALKED ABOUT YOU.

03:48.996 --> 03:52.232
SHE KEPT ASKING WHAT I KNEW
ABOUT YOU AND YOUR FAMILY.

03:52.333 --> 03:54.234
SHE WAS PRETTY OBSESSIVE
ABOUT IT.

03:54.335 --> 03:57.305
AND I THEN I REMEMBERED HOW
JUMPY YOU GET EVERY TIME
I MENTION HER NAME.

03:57.405 --> 04:00.341
SO I THOUGHT MAYBE
SOMETHING WENT ON
BETWEEN YOU.

04:00.441 --> 04:03.577
MAYBE YOU,
A MARRIED MAN--

04:03.677 --> 04:07.281
HOW SHOULD I PUT IT?
YOU FOOLED AROUND
WITH HER.

04:07.381 --> 04:08.916
WHAT ARE YOU SUGGESTING,
ALEX?

04:09.016 --> 04:10.918
CAN YOU JUST SAY
THAT NOTHING HAPPENED
BETWEEN YOU?

04:11.018 --> 04:13.287
- WHY IS THAT SO DIFFICULT?
- ALEX, WE'VE TALKED
ABOUT THIS.

04:13.387 --> 04:16.924
I WILL ONLY DISCUSS
YOUR RELATIONSHIP
WITH LAURA,

04:17.024 --> 04:20.294
- NOTHING ELSE.
- SWEET. SO YOU DISCUSS
MINE, BUT NOT YOURS.

04:20.394 --> 04:23.631
THE POINT I'M TRYING TO MAKE
IS THAT MY OTHER PATIENTS

04:23.731 --> 04:25.566
HAVE NOTHING TO DO
WITH YOUR THERAPY.

04:25.666 --> 04:27.701
EXCUSE ME. YOU HAVING SEX
WITH SOMEBODY I'M DATING

04:27.801 --> 04:29.503
SOUNDS VERY RELEVANT
TO MY THERAPY.

04:29.603 --> 04:31.405
DID SHE SAY TO YOU
THAT SHE WAS HAVING
SEX WITH ME?

04:31.505 --> 04:33.307
- DIDN'T HAVE TO.
- BUT YOU'RE CONVINCED
THAT SHE DID.

04:33.407 --> 04:34.942
I'M JUST ASKING.

04:35.042 --> 04:36.910
THE ONLY RELEVANT THING
IS HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT
THE POSSIBILITY

04:37.010 --> 04:39.980
OF LAURA HAVING SEX
WITH SOMEBODY OTHER
THAN YOURSELF.

04:40.080 --> 04:42.383
DON'T START WITH
YOUR ASININE BULLSHIT.
YOU'RE COPPING OUT.

04:42.483 --> 04:45.353
WOULD YOU STOP TRYING
TO FORCE ME INTO THIS
RELATIONSHIP YOU'VE CONCOCTED?

04:45.453 --> 04:47.054
WHY IN THE HELL
WOULD I DO THAT?

04:47.154 --> 04:48.789
MAYBE YOU WANT
TO COMPETE WITH ME, ALEX.

04:48.889 --> 04:51.492
MAYBE IT'S LIKE THE COFFEE,
THE CHECK, YOUR INTELLIGENCE.

04:51.592 --> 04:53.561
IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN,
I'M PAYING TO TALK.

04:53.661 --> 04:56.497
THIS IS WHAT I WANT
TO TALK ABOUT--
YOU AND LAURA,

04:56.597 --> 04:58.165
AND I'D LIKE A STRAIGHT
ANSWER FOR A CHANGE.

04:58.265 --> 05:00.334
HAVE YOU NOTICED THAT
WHEN AN EMOTIONAL ISSUE
COMES UP FOR YOU,

05:00.434 --> 05:03.070
- YOU FOCUS ON MONEY?
- YEAH, I HAVE A DIFFERENT
THEORY, THOUGH, PAUL,

05:03.170 --> 05:06.273
'CAUSE EVERY TIME WE TOUCH
ON SOMETHING THAT HAS
TO DO WITH YOU,

05:06.374 --> 05:08.108
YOU GET SCARED SHITLESS.

05:08.208 --> 05:10.143
WHY WOULD YOU THINK I'D
BE SCARED ABOUT TALKING
ABOUT MYSELF?

05:10.243 --> 05:13.046
YEAH, BECAUSE YOU WANT
YOUR PATIENTS TO THINK
YOU'RE SUPERHUMAN,

05:13.146 --> 05:15.182
YOU'RE A BUDDHA.
YOU DON'T EAT,

05:15.282 --> 05:17.184
YOU DON'T SHIT,
YOU DON'T PISS.

05:17.284 --> 05:20.220
YOU DON'T ARGUE WITH YOUR
WIFE. YOU DON'T FANTASIZE
ABOUT YOUR PATIENTS.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.856
NO, YOU'RE ABOVE ALL
OF THESE EARTHLY THINGS,

05:22.956 --> 05:25.593
BECAUSE YOU LIVE ONLY
FOR YOUR PATIENTS.

05:25.693 --> 05:27.294
YOUR PRIVATE LIFE
DOESN'T MATTER,

05:27.395 --> 05:30.631
ONLY THIS--
THIS INNER SANCTUM.

05:32.433 --> 05:34.334
WHY ARE YOU
GIVING ME THAT LOOK?

05:34.435 --> 05:36.737
WHAT LOOK?
IT'S THE WAY I LOOK.

05:36.837 --> 05:40.140
NO NO NO, THAT LOOK
LIKE YOU KNOW EVERYTHING,

05:40.240 --> 05:42.576
LIKE YOU CAN SEE
RIGHT THROUGH ME.

05:42.676 --> 05:45.212
MAYBE LIKE THE OLD MAN
IN BAGHDAD?

05:45.312 --> 05:47.848
OH, FUCK.

05:47.948 --> 05:50.518
NOW YOU'LL SAY YOU WANT
TO TALK ABOUT MY FATHER,
RIGHT?

05:50.618 --> 05:54.722
OKAY, WOULD YOU LIKE
TO TALK ABOUT YOUR FATHER?

05:56.356 --> 05:58.692
YOU PEOPLE
LOVE THIS SHIT.

05:58.792 --> 06:02.530
THIS IS RIGHT IN YOUR
WHEELHOUSE. YOU WANNA
TALK ABOUT MY FATHER?

06:02.630 --> 06:05.733
GO AHEAD, FIRE AWAY.
ASK ME WHATEVER YOU WANT.

06:05.833 --> 06:08.268
BUT HE IS AN AMAZING MAN,
MY DAD.

06:08.368 --> 06:11.572
- HE REALLY IS.
- BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT
YOU TOLD ME LAST WEEK.

06:11.672 --> 06:14.374
HE'S A GOOD MAN,
OKAY?

06:14.475 --> 06:16.610
THERE'S NOTHING YOU
OR 200 SHRINKS
CAN CHANGE.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.512
OKAY, LET'S PUT ASIDE
FOR THE MOMENT

06:18.612 --> 06:21.348
WHETHER HE'S A GOOD MAN
OR A BAD MAN, OKAY?

06:21.449 --> 06:23.617
WHAT INTERESTS ME

06:23.717 --> 06:26.386
IS HOW YOU FEEL
ABOUT HIM

06:26.487 --> 06:28.956
AND WHAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP
WITH HIM IS LIKE.

06:30.390 --> 06:32.225
WHEN I SAY HE'S
AN AMAZING MAN,

06:32.325 --> 06:35.128
I'M TALKING ABOUT FACTS,
NOT FEELINGS.

06:35.228 --> 06:37.765
WOULD YOU SAY THAT

06:37.865 --> 06:41.702
TO A GIRL WHO WAS
RAPED BY HER FATHER
IN THIRD GRADE?

06:41.802 --> 06:43.737
WOULD YOU TELL HER YOU'RE NOT
INTERESTED IN "GOOD OR BAD,"

06:43.837 --> 06:45.873
YOU'RE ONLY INTERESTED
IN HOW SHE FEELS ABOUT
THE RELATIONSHIP?

06:45.973 --> 06:49.610
WHEN DID GOOD OR BAD
GO OUT OF STYLE?

06:49.710 --> 06:52.713
THAT REFERENCE TO THE GIRL
BEING RAPED BY HER FATHER,

06:52.813 --> 06:54.815
WHERE DOES THAT
COME FROM?

07:03.390 --> 07:05.225
CAN WE GO BACK
TO LAST WEEK?

07:05.325 --> 07:08.095
IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY,
YOU DESCRIBED YOUR FATHER

07:08.195 --> 07:10.263
AS BEING AN UNFAITHFUL MAN.

07:10.363 --> 07:12.666
YOU SAID THAT
HE WAS UNGRATEFUL.

07:12.766 --> 07:16.236
HE TREATED YOUR
MOTHER REALLY TERRIBLY,

07:16.336 --> 07:17.671
BUT THAT
AT THE SAME TIME

07:17.771 --> 07:21.141
YOU HAD A GREAT
ADMIRATION FOR HIM.

07:21.241 --> 07:22.976
THAT'S CORRECT, YES?

07:23.076 --> 07:26.013
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT
YOUR FEELINGS ABOUT
YOUR FATHER, ALEX,

07:26.113 --> 07:28.949
ARE PRETTY CONFLICTED.

07:29.049 --> 07:30.684
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT I SAID AT ALL.

07:30.784 --> 07:33.153
WELL, MAYBE YOU
COULD EXPLAIN IT

07:33.253 --> 07:34.988
TO ME A LITTLE BIT MORE.

07:35.088 --> 07:38.659
FUCK THAT, IT'S NO USE.
YOU'RE GONNA HEAR
WHAT YOU WANNA HEAR.

07:45.365 --> 07:47.367
DO YOU AND YOUR
DAD TALK A LOT?

07:47.467 --> 07:50.904
YEAH, WE TALK,
AS MUCH AS IS NECESSARY.

07:51.004 --> 07:52.840
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN,
"AS MUCH AS IS NECESSARY?"

07:52.940 --> 07:55.876
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND
THAT QUESTION.
- WELL, WHO CALLS WHO?

07:55.976 --> 07:58.646
WE TALK AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.
HE'S NOT A CHATTERBOX.

07:58.746 --> 08:00.848
HE'S PRECISE, YOU KNOW?
HE'S TO THE POINT, BOOM.

08:00.948 --> 08:03.483
HE CUTS STRAIGHT
TO THE HEART OF THINGS.

08:03.584 --> 08:06.253
HE'S LIKE IRON, MY DAD,
CAST IRON.

08:06.353 --> 08:09.089
IRON
IN EVERYTHING HE DOES,

08:09.189 --> 08:10.858
HIS MOVEMENT,
EVERYTHING--

08:10.958 --> 08:14.828
THE WAY HE WORKS,
THE WAY HE THINKS,
HIS WISDOM.

08:14.928 --> 08:17.397
I DON'T THINK THERE'S
A BOOK HE HASN'T READ.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.733
I'M TALKING REAL
LITERATURE, DOC--

08:19.833 --> 08:21.802
HISTORY,
POLITICAL SCIENCE--

08:21.902 --> 08:24.738
EVERYTHING. THE MAN
IS 70 YEARS OLD

08:24.838 --> 08:28.041
AND HE WORKS LIKE
HE DID 30 YEARS AGO.

08:28.141 --> 08:31.244
HE'S AS HEALTHY AS A HORSE.
HE CAN STILL BEAT ME
IN ARM WRESTLING.

08:31.344 --> 08:35.916
HE'S... HE'S IRON.

08:36.016 --> 08:38.852
YOU KNOW, WHEN I THINK
OF IRON, I TEND TO THINK
OF SOMETHING

08:38.952 --> 08:42.556
THAT'S REALLY
INDESTRUCTIBLE,

08:42.656 --> 08:45.092
THAT'S INCREDIBLY...

08:45.192 --> 08:46.359
POWERFUL, STRONG,

08:46.459 --> 08:48.328
AND YET AT THE SAME TIME

08:48.428 --> 08:51.264
SOMETHING THAT'S
KIND OF COLD.

08:56.604 --> 08:59.039
HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT WHAT I DID,

09:01.474 --> 09:04.812
KILLING PEOPLE,
DROPPING THE BOMB
ON THE MADRASSA?

09:04.912 --> 09:08.215
- WHY ARE YOU
GOING BACK TO THAT?
- SIMPLE QUESTION, DOC.

09:08.315 --> 09:10.417
YOU KNOW, IT'S ABOUT
YOUR MAIN THING-- FEELINGS.

09:10.517 --> 09:13.353
HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT WHAT I DID

09:13.453 --> 09:15.756
WHEN I DROPPED A BOMB
ON 16 KIDS?

09:15.856 --> 09:17.290
I'M NOT HERE
TO JUDGE YOU, ALEX.

09:17.390 --> 09:19.026
I'M NOT ASKING
FOR A JUDGMENT.
I WANNA KNOW,

09:19.126 --> 09:22.529
- HOW DO YOU FEEL?
- HOW DO I FEEL?

09:22.630 --> 09:25.432
WELL, I THINK IT MUST BE
VERY DIFFICULT FOR YOU

09:25.532 --> 09:28.535
TO LIVE
WITH WHAT HAPPENED.

09:28.636 --> 09:31.805
( laughs )

09:31.905 --> 09:33.807
WHAT?

09:35.042 --> 09:38.011
YOU HAVE MADE AN ART
AND A SCIENCE

09:38.111 --> 09:41.281
AND A CAREER OUT
OF TAKING THE EASY
POSITION.

09:41.381 --> 09:44.652
DO YOU REALLY THINK NOT
JUDGING YOU IS EASY, ALEX?

09:44.752 --> 09:46.586
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING:
IT'S NOT.

09:46.687 --> 09:49.456
WHY CAN'T YOU JUST SAY
YOU THINK I'M A MURDERER?

09:49.556 --> 09:50.891
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT'S
WHAT YOU THINK.

09:50.991 --> 09:53.994
I KNOW THAT'S
WHAT YOU TALK ABOUT

09:54.094 --> 09:56.697
WHEN YOU'RE OUT
WITH YOUR FRIENDS
AT SOME FANCY RESTAURANT.

09:56.797 --> 09:58.531
YOU SIT AROUND THE TABLE,
AND YOU SAY,

09:58.632 --> 10:01.434
"IT'S TERRIBLE.
IT'S AWFUL.

10:01.534 --> 10:05.038
IT'S A MASSACRE.
WHAT IT DOES TO THEM,
IT'S JUST ATROCIOUS.

10:05.138 --> 10:07.808
WHAT IT DOES TO US..."
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING:

10:09.309 --> 10:11.411
I COME HERE

10:11.511 --> 10:13.546
AND I PUT MY TRUST
IN YOU.

10:13.647 --> 10:15.816
WHY CAN'T YOU BE
HONEST ENOUGH

10:15.916 --> 10:19.052
TO JUST TELL ME
HOW YOU FEEL?

10:24.658 --> 10:26.927
YOU KNOW WHAT
MY FATHER SAID

10:27.027 --> 10:28.395
WHEN I TOLD HIM
ABOUT THE MISSION?

10:28.495 --> 10:31.231
WHAT?

10:38.872 --> 10:41.041
THAT'S WHAT HE SAID.

10:42.676 --> 10:45.078
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT WAS THE SMARTEST
REACTION I GOT FROM ANYBODY,

10:45.178 --> 10:47.647
INCLUDING YOU AND ALL
THE OTHER BLEEDING HEARTS.

10:47.748 --> 10:49.950
'CAUSE THERE'S
REALLY NOTHING TO SAY.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA SAY?

10:50.050 --> 10:52.652
SOME THINGS CAN'T
BE EXPLAINED AWAY.

10:52.753 --> 10:56.523
SOMETIMES YOU CAN'T PEEL
AWAY SOMETHING AND FIND--
IT'S JUST AS PLAIN AS CAN BE.

10:56.623 --> 10:59.059
16 KIDS BURIED, DEAD
UNDER A BUILDING.

10:59.159 --> 11:01.028
THAT'S IT.

11:01.128 --> 11:03.596
MY FATHER HAD IT RIGHT,
THE OLD MAN. YOU GOTTA
BE LIKE THAT.

11:03.697 --> 11:05.598
YOU GOTTA BE
LIKE IRON, BABY.

11:05.699 --> 11:07.600
IT MUST BE VERY DIFFICULT
FOR YOU TO HAVE LIVED

11:07.701 --> 11:09.737
IN THE SHADOW OF SOMEBODY
WHO THINKS LIKE THAT,

11:09.837 --> 11:12.940
THAT YOU'VE GOT TO BE LIKE
IRON ALL THE TIME.

11:13.040 --> 11:14.775
DO YOU SEE HOW YOU
TWIST THINGS AROUND?

11:14.875 --> 11:16.977
AM I EVER GONNA GET OUT
OF THIS ALIVE?

11:17.077 --> 11:19.947
IF I SAID HE WAS A PUSSY,
YOU'D HAVE A COMMENT
ABOUT THAT.

11:20.047 --> 11:23.416
IF I SAID HE WAS A HERO,
YOU'D HAVE A COMMENT
ABOUT THAT.

11:23.516 --> 11:26.186
YOU LOVE TO SIT HERE.
YOU LISTEN TO PEOPLE'S
PROBLEMS

11:26.286 --> 11:28.288
SO YOU CAN PROBABLY SIT
ON YOUR PORCH AT THE END
OF THE DAY

11:28.388 --> 11:31.759
AND JUST TELL YOURSELF,
"WOW, MY LIFE IS SO GREAT."

11:31.859 --> 11:34.728
CAN WE STAY FOCUSED
ON WHAT THE ISSUE IS

11:34.828 --> 11:37.397
WE'RE TRYING
TO DEAL WITH HERE?

11:37.497 --> 11:39.466
THE DIFFICULTY
THAT YOU MUST HAVE HAD

11:39.566 --> 11:42.702
LIVING IN THE SHADOW
OF YOUR FATHER,

11:42.803 --> 11:45.005
IN A WORLD WHERE YOU'RE
NOT ALLOWED TO EXPRESS

11:45.105 --> 11:48.275
WHO YOU ARE,

11:48.375 --> 11:51.478
YOUR TENDER SIDE,
MAYBE YOUR FEMININE SIDE,

11:51.578 --> 11:54.581
FOR EXAMPLE.
SO WHAT DO YOU DO?

11:54.681 --> 11:57.184
THE ONLY THING YOU
CAN DO IS DEFY HIM.

11:57.284 --> 11:59.519
YOU HAVE TO FIGHT
WITH EVERYTHING YOU HAVE.

11:59.619 --> 12:03.190
BUT YOU KNOW
SOMETHING, ALEX?

12:03.290 --> 12:04.792
YOU HAVEN'T DONE THAT.

12:04.892 --> 12:07.160
YOU HAVEN'T DARED
TO DO THAT.

12:07.260 --> 12:10.530
YOUR FATHER IS
SUCH A POWERFUL,
IMPOSING CHARACTER

12:10.630 --> 12:12.399
THAT YOU'RE TERRIFIED
HE'LL CRUSH YOU.

12:12.499 --> 12:15.435
SO YOU COME THROUGH
THIS DOOR WITH ALL
YOUR RAGE,

12:15.535 --> 12:17.404
YOUR RESENTMENT,
YOUR JEALOUSY,

12:17.504 --> 12:20.273
YOUR BURIED ANGER
TOWARD HIM.

12:20.373 --> 12:22.475
YOU BRING IT IN HERE
AND YOU LET IT LOOSE
ON ME.

12:22.575 --> 12:24.577
THAT'S WHAT YOU DO,
BUT THAT'S OKAY.

12:24.677 --> 12:27.114
THAT'S FINE.
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

12:30.083 --> 12:33.921
I THINK THAT'S THE MOST
PATRONIZING THING I'VE
EVER HEARD.

12:36.289 --> 12:38.458
( knock on door )

12:43.430 --> 12:45.933
YOUR WIFE?

12:48.535 --> 12:50.137
IT'S OKAY,
GO AHEAD.

12:50.237 --> 12:52.840
NO NO, IT'S FINE,
REALLY.

12:52.940 --> 12:55.608
I APOLOGIZE.

12:55.708 --> 12:57.777
JESUS, LOOK LOOK
LOOK AT YOU.

12:57.878 --> 12:59.646
LOOK AT HOW
STRESSED YOU GET

12:59.746 --> 13:02.049
JUST THINKING
THAT I MIGHT LEARN
THE SLIGHTEST DETAIL

13:02.149 --> 13:04.651
ABOUT YOUR LIFE. SO WHAT?
YOU GOT A WIFE AT HOME.

13:04.751 --> 13:06.553
BIG DEAL.

13:06.653 --> 13:08.889
SEE, THAT'S THE REAL
PROBLEM WITH ALL YOUR
THEORIES, PAUL.

13:08.989 --> 13:11.758
THEY COMPLETELY
IGNORE YOUR SIDE
OF THE WHOLE EQUATION,

13:11.859 --> 13:14.794
THAT YOU ARE
ALSO HUMAN.

13:14.895 --> 13:16.930
YEAH, YOU HAVE
THIS NICE THEORY

13:17.030 --> 13:19.666
THAT I SEE YOU
AS MY FATHER

13:19.766 --> 13:21.068
AND THAT'S WHY
I WANT TO--

13:21.168 --> 13:23.436
WHAT DID YOU SAY?
DEFY YOU.

13:23.536 --> 13:26.139
BUT WHAT ABOUT YOU?
WHY DO YOU KEEP
MAKING IT SEEM

13:26.239 --> 13:28.675
AS IF YOU HAVE NO
PERSONAL STAKE IN THIS,

13:28.775 --> 13:32.512
AS IF YOU'RE
ONLY HERE FOR ME?
IT'S A DECEPTION, PAUL.

13:34.447 --> 13:37.985
OKAY, LET'S TAKE LAURA,
FOR EXAMPLE.

13:38.085 --> 13:41.688
YOU PLAY SUCH A BIG
ROLE IN HER LIFE,
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

13:41.788 --> 13:43.957
SHE KNOWS NOTHING
ABOUT YOU.

13:44.057 --> 13:47.327
SHE'S SURE YOU'RE ONE
OF THE MOST PERFECT
PEOPLE SHE'S EVER MET

13:47.427 --> 13:49.729
AND SHE HASN'T THE FAINTEST IDEA
OF WHO YOU ARE,

13:49.829 --> 13:52.799
WHAT YOUR BELIEFS ARE,
HOW LONG YOU'VE BEEN
MARRIED-- NOTHING!

13:52.900 --> 13:56.269
DOESN'T IT JUST SEEM
A LITTLE INSANE TO YOU?

13:56.369 --> 14:00.173
WHO ARE YOU, REALLY?

14:01.909 --> 14:04.111
HUH?

14:06.379 --> 14:09.082
I KNOW THE WHOLE TRUTH
ABOUT YOU.

14:09.182 --> 14:11.684
YOU'RE NOT MADE OF IRON,
THAT'S FOR DAMN SURE.

14:11.784 --> 14:14.287
NOT EVEN CLOSE.

14:15.488 --> 14:17.790
PAUL...

14:17.891 --> 14:21.161
DID YOU HAVE SOMETHING
GOING ON WITH HER

14:21.261 --> 14:24.231
OR NOT?

14:28.001 --> 14:31.004
( sighs ) YOU...

14:31.104 --> 14:32.772
REALLY ARE PERVERTED.

14:32.872 --> 14:36.043
YOU KNOW THAT SHE'S
YOUNG ENOUGH TO BE
YOUR DAUGHTER, MAN.

14:36.143 --> 14:39.446
DURING ALL OUR SESSIONS HERE,
I BET YOU SIT HERE

14:39.546 --> 14:41.714
AND YOU IMAGINE
HOW I SCREWED HER, RIGHT?

14:41.814 --> 14:45.352
YOU TRYING TO MAKE
ME ANGRY? IS THAT WHAT
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO?

14:45.452 --> 14:48.155
HEY, DON'T TRY TO TURN
THIS INTO MY PSYCHOSIS.
I'M ONTO YOUR SHIT.

14:48.255 --> 14:49.822
BUT YOU'RE THE ONE
IN THERAPY.

14:49.923 --> 14:51.458
NO, YOU'RE THE ONE
NOT TELLING THE TRUTH.

14:51.558 --> 14:53.693
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO'S BULLSHITTING ME.

14:53.793 --> 14:57.264
YOU'RE THE HYPOCRITE.
I COME IN HERE EVERY WEEK
AND I TELL YOU EVERYTHING.

14:57.364 --> 14:59.466
NOW YOU CAN'T LOOK ME
IN THE EYE

14:59.566 --> 15:01.434
AND ADMIT THAT YOU ARE
FALLING IN LOVE

15:01.534 --> 15:04.904
WITH A PATIENT
20 YEARS YOUNGER THAN YOU.

15:05.005 --> 15:07.107
I MEAN, COME ON.
YOU CAN'T HANG WITH HER.

15:07.207 --> 15:09.542
COME ON,
LOOK AT YOU.

15:11.611 --> 15:13.546
YOU'LL LOOK LIKE A FOOL.

15:13.646 --> 15:17.184
TRUST ME. YOU CAN'T
KEEP UP WITH HER PACE.
I CAN TELL YOU THAT.

15:17.284 --> 15:20.320
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING:
WHY DID YOU HAVE TO
SLEEP WITH HER?

15:20.420 --> 15:22.389
I DON'T KNOW.
I GOT TIRED OF JERKING OFF.

15:22.489 --> 15:24.724
A THOUSAND WOMEN
COULD HAVE FULFILLED
THAT FUNCTION.

15:24.824 --> 15:26.426
WHY LAURA?

15:26.526 --> 15:28.528
SHE'S SEXY AS HELL.
HAVE YOU NOTICED?

15:28.628 --> 15:31.431
I THINK THAT YOU ARE
TRYING TO GET BACK
AT ME--

15:31.531 --> 15:34.034
- OOH!
- --BECAUSE SHE
WAS MY PATIENT.

15:34.134 --> 15:36.069
THE WHOLE WORLD REVOLVES
AROUND YOUR ASS?

15:36.169 --> 15:37.737
I UNDERSTAND YOUR THEORY.

15:37.837 --> 15:40.040
YOU'VE BEEN HINTING
AT IT FOR THE LAST
THREE SESSIONS.

15:40.140 --> 15:41.841
THAT AIN'T FLYING
EITHER.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.810
YOU REALLY THINK THAT
EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED

15:43.910 --> 15:45.979
BETWEEN ME AND HER
WAS MEANT TO HURT YOU?

15:46.079 --> 15:47.780
YOU DID IT
TO PROVOKE ME.

15:47.880 --> 15:50.350
MAYBE YOU WERE
LOOKING FOR A REACTION,
SOME KIND OF REACTION,

15:50.450 --> 15:52.285
ANYTHING MORE THAN A PAT
ON THE THIGH.

15:52.385 --> 15:54.887
SOMETHING EMOTIONAL,
EVEN IF IT'S ANGER.

15:54.988 --> 15:58.625
WOW,
THAT'S INTERESTING.

16:00.027 --> 16:02.395
THAT'S ANOTHER BRILLIANT
THEORY THERE, DOC.

16:04.131 --> 16:07.234
BUT HOW ABOUT YOU,
PAUL?

16:07.334 --> 16:09.302
THE FACT THAT
YOUR WIFE IS

16:09.402 --> 16:12.572
SCREWING HER LOVER
IN SOME PATHETIC HOTEL

16:12.672 --> 16:16.576
OVERLOOKING
THE PIAZZA DI TREVI
IN ROME,

16:18.245 --> 16:20.513
IS THAT GETTING
A REACTION OUT OF YOU?

16:23.416 --> 16:26.719
YEAH, YOU'D BE
REAL SURPRISED

16:26.819 --> 16:29.922
THE KIND OF INFORMATION
YOU FIND OUT FROM A FEW
PHONE CALLS.

16:30.023 --> 16:33.193
YEAH, I FOUND OUT
A BUNCH OF THINGS, PAUL,

16:33.293 --> 16:36.096
ABOUT WHOLE BUNCH
OF SUBJECTS.

16:36.196 --> 16:39.432
IN FACT, I'VE BEEN TAKING
A LITTLE INTEREST

16:39.532 --> 16:40.800
IN PSYCHOLOGY LATELY.

16:40.900 --> 16:43.203
I'VE BEEN MEANING
TO CHECK OUT WHAT
YOU GOT HERE.

16:43.303 --> 16:46.473
I EVEN READ A BOOK
LAURA GAVE ME,

16:46.573 --> 16:50.510
ABOUT THE WHOLE CONCEPT
OF RECIPROCITY IN THERAPY,

16:50.610 --> 16:53.546
ABOUT HOW EVERYTHING
THAT GOES ON IN HERE

16:53.646 --> 16:55.415
SHOULD BE RECIPROCAL.

16:55.515 --> 16:57.950
SO IT MADE ME THINK.

16:58.051 --> 17:00.187
YOU SIT HERE,
YOU LISTEN TO ME

17:00.287 --> 17:03.423
AND YOU PRETEND
TO SOLVE ALL MY PROBLEMS.

17:03.523 --> 17:06.593
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE
A FUCKING CLUE
ABOUT YOURSELF.

17:06.693 --> 17:08.461
SO I FIGURE--

17:08.561 --> 17:09.962
NAH.

17:10.063 --> 17:12.832
HEY, I GOT A CHOICE.

17:12.932 --> 17:16.236
EITHER I ACCEPT YOUR
SUPERIORITY AS IF YOU'RE
SOME KIND OF GOD,

17:16.336 --> 17:19.239
OR I USE
MY INTELLIGENCE

17:19.339 --> 17:21.408
AND DO A LITTLE
INVESTIGATING,

17:21.508 --> 17:24.911
JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT
THIS GOD IS NOT SOME
KIND OF DR. RUTH

17:25.011 --> 17:28.281
WHO TELLS EVERYBODY
HOW TO FUCK WHILE
SHE'S STILL A VIRGIN.

17:28.381 --> 17:30.350
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
70 YEARS OLD AND HEY--

17:30.450 --> 17:33.286
BUT, HEY, SO I MADE
A FEW CALLS, PAUL.

17:33.386 --> 17:35.355
NOTHING TOO COMPLICATED.
MORE OR LESS
THE SAME PEOPLE

17:35.455 --> 17:36.956
I CONSULTED
BEFORE COMING HERE.

17:37.056 --> 17:39.959
WHAT'S AMAZING IS

17:40.059 --> 17:41.494
HOW MANY PEOPLE
ARE DYING

17:41.594 --> 17:44.331
TO HELP YOU FIND
WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.

17:49.802 --> 17:51.971
I FOUND
A HELL OF A GOD

17:52.071 --> 17:54.741
IN MY INVESTIGATIONS,

18:00.447 --> 18:03.883
A GOD WHOSE LIFE
IS FALLING APART,

18:03.983 --> 18:06.919
WHOSE WIFE IS
SLEEPING AROUND

18:07.019 --> 18:08.488
BEHIND HIS BACK,

18:08.588 --> 18:12.091
WHOSE DAUGHTER
IS FUCKING JUNKIES,

18:12.192 --> 18:15.162
WHOSE FATHER--

18:16.463 --> 18:18.998
YEAH, WHOSE FATHER
IS ROTTING AWAY

18:19.098 --> 18:21.134
IN SOME GERIATRIC
HOSPITAL SOMEWHERE

18:21.234 --> 18:23.069
IN VIRGINIA, AND WHY?

18:23.170 --> 18:25.071
IS THE SON TOO STINGY

18:25.172 --> 18:27.106
TO PAY FOR A SLIGHTLY
MORE LIVEABLE PLACE?

18:27.207 --> 18:30.643
( scoffs ) WHAT A GOD.

18:30.743 --> 18:32.212
AND THEN LAURA
COMES ALONG,

18:32.312 --> 18:34.181
YOUR SEXIEST PATIENT YET,

18:34.281 --> 18:36.983
AND HER ONLY WISH IN LIFE
IS TO GET YOU INTO BED

18:37.083 --> 18:40.587
BECAUSE SHE THINKS
THAT'S GONNA SOLVE ALL
OF HER SEXUAL HANGUPS.

18:40.687 --> 18:44.457
AND YOU, YOU FALL IN LOVE
WITH THAT CRAZY SLUT--

18:44.557 --> 18:47.827
DON'T YOU FUCKING TALK
ABOUT MY PATIENTS,
YOU FUCK!

18:48.995 --> 18:51.198
HOW FUCKING DARE YOU!

18:53.900 --> 18:55.835
YOU PRICK.

19:45.685 --> 19:47.587
( winces )

19:50.990 --> 19:52.959
( sighs )

20:41.841 --> 20:45.378
RICHARD, IT'S PAUL.
LOOK, I'M REALLY SORRY.

20:45.478 --> 20:49.416
I HAVE TO CANCEL
OUR SESSION.

20:51.183 --> 20:54.487
TODAY, I--

20:54.587 --> 20:57.490
I'M SORRY
IT'S SUCH SHORT NOTICE.

20:57.590 --> 21:00.793
SOMETHING HAS COME UP
AND--

21:02.094 --> 21:03.730
I'LL GET BACK TO YOU.

21:03.830 --> 21:06.699
CALL ME IF THERE'S
A PROBLEM, BYE.

21:16.409 --> 21:18.311
WHAT'S HAPPENED?

21:18.411 --> 21:21.614
NOTHING.
IT WAS--

21:21.714 --> 21:23.950
WHY ARE YOU CANCELING
YOUR APPOINTMENTS, PAUL?

21:29.188 --> 21:30.623
WHEN DID YOU GET IN?

21:30.723 --> 21:33.259
IT WAS ABOUT
10 MINUTES AGO.

21:33.360 --> 21:35.462
WAS THAT YOU KNOCKING
AT THE DOOR?

21:35.562 --> 21:37.830
PAUL, I'M SO SORRY.

21:37.930 --> 21:41.968
- HONESTLY, I THOUGHT
YOU WERE ALONE.
- IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY.

21:43.169 --> 21:46.406
WHAT DID YOU DO
TO YOUR HAND?

21:46.506 --> 21:50.042
ACCIDENT.
I DROPPED A--

22:28.781 --> 22:30.750
LET ME SEE.

22:53.673 --> 22:56.809
- YOU'LL SURVIVE, YOU KNOW?
- ( scoffs )

23:02.482 --> 23:04.283
HOW ARE THE KIDS?

23:04.383 --> 23:07.720
MAX KEPT ASKING
WHEN YOU WERE COMING HOME.

23:09.456 --> 23:11.824
I DIDN'T QUITE KNOW
WHAT TO SAY TO HIM.

23:26.205 --> 23:29.542
PAUL, WE MOVED
INTO SEPARATE ROOMS
ON THE FIRST DAY.

23:31.511 --> 23:34.681
IT'S COMPLETELY OVER,
IF THAT MATTERS AT ALL.

23:35.515 --> 23:37.383
( door opens )

23:37.484 --> 23:39.686
( footsteps approaching )

23:49.028 --> 23:51.163
THANKS.

23:52.899 --> 23:54.867
I'VE GOT TO...

24:35.407 --> 24:37.744
HELLO, JULIAN.
COME IN.

24:47.286 --> 24:49.756
( theme music playing )
