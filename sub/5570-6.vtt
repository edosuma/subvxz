WEBVTT

00:01.302 --> 00:02.670
My name is Brian Finch.

00:02.703 --> 00:04.405
I was your average
28-year-old screwup

00:04.438 --> 00:07.041
until I took a pill called NZT.

00:07.075 --> 00:10.744
Suddenly I had access
to every brain cell.

00:10.778 --> 00:11.779
And that's why
the FBI hired me.

00:11.812 --> 00:12.613
My name's Brian Finch,

00:12.646 --> 00:13.614
this is Rebecca Harris,

00:13.647 --> 00:14.782
and we're with the FBI.

00:14.815 --> 00:16.384
God, that sounds cool.

00:16.417 --> 00:18.119
There's just one problem.

00:18.152 --> 00:19.620
NZT will kill you,

00:19.653 --> 00:21.755
unless you have this shot.

00:21.789 --> 00:24.392
Now you can have as much NZT as
you want with no side effects.

00:24.425 --> 00:26.160
My name's Sands.

00:26.194 --> 00:28.396
You belong to Mr. Morra now,
which means

00:28.429 --> 00:30.098
you belong to me.

00:30.131 --> 00:31.565
We know quite a lot about NZT.

00:31.599 --> 00:33.367
FBI's playing catch-up.

00:33.401 --> 00:35.236
I want you to find out
exactly what they know

00:35.269 --> 00:36.704
and bring it to me.

00:36.737 --> 00:38.272
BRIAN:
I made a copy of this file.

00:38.306 --> 00:39.807
I can't tell you
exactly how I got it.

00:39.840 --> 00:42.176
But I do think you should
know what's inside.

00:45.579 --> 00:47.848
The FBI knew your father
was on NZT before he died.

00:47.881 --> 00:49.450
Rebecca, they've
known since

00:49.483 --> 00:50.851
before you started
working at the CJC.

00:50.884 --> 00:53.121
REBECCA:
Where did you get this?

00:53.154 --> 00:55.289
Naz's office.

00:55.323 --> 00:56.557
You stole it?

00:56.590 --> 00:59.460
They're giving me
that drug every day.

00:59.493 --> 01:02.496
Naz showed me the files
on the FBI studies.

01:02.530 --> 01:04.798
Yeah, but your dad
wasn't part of the FBI trials.

01:04.832 --> 01:06.300
They were also
tracking civilians

01:06.334 --> 01:09.237
who they thought
might be using NZT.

01:09.270 --> 01:11.739
Why didn't Naz tell me this?

01:13.241 --> 01:17.111
Why are you telling me this when
I could send you to jail for it?

01:17.145 --> 01:20.181
I thought you'd want to know.

01:20.214 --> 01:22.250
I do.

01:25.219 --> 01:27.121
I want to know
why my boss has a file

01:27.155 --> 01:29.757
on my murdered father
and didn't tell me.

01:29.790 --> 01:32.860
I want to know
what happened to him,

01:32.893 --> 01:36.130
I want to know what the FBI
had to do with it.

01:36.164 --> 01:37.365
I'll help you.

01:37.398 --> 01:38.599
REBECCA:
We can't let anyone know

01:38.632 --> 01:41.269
what we're doing.

01:43.937 --> 01:45.639
It doesn't say who
was following your dad

01:45.673 --> 01:47.475
or how long the FBI
was tracking him.

01:47.508 --> 01:48.809
Just some background on him.

01:48.842 --> 01:51.545
And this one note.

01:51.579 --> 01:54.615
"Upper East Side NZT cluster."

01:54.648 --> 01:56.150
My dad was a painter.

01:56.184 --> 01:57.451
He was broke his whole life.

01:57.485 --> 01:59.420
There was nothing
Upper East Side about him.

01:59.453 --> 02:00.788
Well, no, he went
to rehab there.

02:00.821 --> 02:03.591
The, uh... New Springs
Recovery Center.

02:03.624 --> 02:06.160
That place costs
thousands of dollars a week!

02:06.194 --> 02:07.628
Celebrities go there.

02:07.661 --> 02:08.696
He couldn't afford that.

02:08.729 --> 02:09.763
Well, he was there.

02:09.797 --> 02:11.799
I mean, it says he was
discharged September 2013.

02:11.832 --> 02:15.603
And the FBI thinks he got his
NZT from the Upper East Side.

02:15.636 --> 02:18.172
Might be worth checking out.
Boyle's always had my back.

02:18.206 --> 02:20.274
I don't want
to drag him into this.

02:20.308 --> 02:21.475
I'll tell him I'm
running something down

02:21.509 --> 02:22.943
for my old boss in Criminal.

02:22.976 --> 02:24.778
BRIAN:
What about Mike and Ike?

02:24.812 --> 02:26.847
REBECCA:
I'll tell them you're
working on something for me.

02:26.880 --> 02:28.716
You need to be able to come
and go for a few days.

02:28.749 --> 02:30.318
BRIAN:
All right.

02:30.351 --> 02:31.519
That's it?

02:31.552 --> 02:32.920
We're locked and loaded?

02:36.924 --> 02:39.293
Brian?

02:39.327 --> 02:42.230
Yeah?
Thank you.

02:42.263 --> 02:43.697
I'm pretty sure I just made you
an accessory to a crime.

02:43.731 --> 02:44.865
You don't have to thank me.

02:44.898 --> 02:46.700
Good morning.
Morning.
Morning--

02:46.734 --> 02:47.968
Rebecca, could I see you
in my office, please?

02:48.001 --> 02:50.204
Sure.

02:52.373 --> 02:55.509
I assume you're familiar
with the concept of a red team?

02:55.543 --> 02:57.345
You mean, like a war game?

02:57.378 --> 03:00.348
The Pentagon stages
inter-agency exercises

03:00.381 --> 03:03.284
to test our readiness
for different threat scenarios.

03:03.317 --> 03:04.985
This time
they're looking at

03:05.018 --> 03:08.289
what could happen in the wake
of a cyberattack on the economy.

03:08.322 --> 03:10.491
A blue team
represents the U.S.

03:10.524 --> 03:13.227
and its interests
from Washington.

03:13.261 --> 03:16.264
A red team play the enemy,
based here in New York.

03:16.297 --> 03:17.998
I will be working
with EAD Paulson

03:18.031 --> 03:20.334
to head up that red team.

03:20.368 --> 03:22.002
Sounds like quite an honor.

03:22.035 --> 03:24.338
Yeah, it is.
It's also quite an undertaking.

03:24.372 --> 03:27.408
Which is why they've
asked me to select

03:27.441 --> 03:30.644
an exceptional agent
to participate this time.

03:30.678 --> 03:33.481
What do you say?

03:33.514 --> 03:35.015
That's very flattering.

03:35.048 --> 03:37.251
Um...

03:37.285 --> 03:39.387
I have a brutal
case load right now.

03:39.420 --> 03:41.822
So maybe Boyle could help you.

03:41.855 --> 03:43.957
I chose you.

03:43.991 --> 03:46.294
Director Avery played
on three different red teams

03:46.327 --> 03:47.495
when he was coming up.

03:47.528 --> 03:50.831
This is how careers are made.

03:50.864 --> 03:52.600
REBECCA:
Are you kidding me?

03:52.633 --> 03:54.802
She smiled at me
like we were sealing

03:54.835 --> 03:56.304
some kind of pact
or something.

03:56.337 --> 03:57.405
That woman is not my mentor.

03:57.438 --> 03:58.606
No, but she thinks she is.

03:58.639 --> 03:59.840
And you got to kind of let her.

04:01.375 --> 04:03.010
I mean, you know you have
to do this, right?

04:03.043 --> 04:06.414
It's three days of sitting
right beside Naz.

04:06.447 --> 04:08.382
That's true,
but on the bright side,

04:08.416 --> 04:09.750
it does keep her busy.

04:09.783 --> 04:12.353
And plus, you get to be
the bad guys, right?

04:12.386 --> 04:13.354
I mean, you're kind of mad

04:13.387 --> 04:15.556
at the whole military-industrial
thing right now.

04:15.589 --> 04:17.024
So burn it all to the ground.

04:17.057 --> 04:18.626
Anarchy in the streets.

04:18.659 --> 04:21.061
You make yourself the barbarian
queen of New York City.

04:21.094 --> 04:23.897
And I'll go to the rehab center
and see what I can find

04:23.931 --> 04:26.334
about your dad.
Fine.

04:26.367 --> 04:29.537
Just... don't get caught
breaking in there.

04:29.570 --> 04:31.572
I'm not gonna break in.

04:34.074 --> 04:36.910
Hi, my name is Mike Ikerson,
and I'm an addict.

04:36.944 --> 04:38.646
Welcome to New Springs.

04:38.679 --> 04:40.381
So, tell me
have you been...

04:40.414 --> 04:42.082
BRIAN:
Suffice it to say,
Mike Ikerson has issues.

04:42.115 --> 04:43.351
I know, they always look so...

04:43.384 --> 04:44.818
Hi, everybody.
My name's Mike.

04:44.852 --> 04:46.320
A lot of issues.

04:46.354 --> 04:47.721
I'm, uh, happy to be here.

04:47.755 --> 04:49.089
I do think he made
some breakthroughs

04:49.122 --> 04:50.658
in group therapy, though.

04:50.691 --> 04:51.892
Unfortunately, there was only

04:51.925 --> 04:53.093
so much time for introspection.

04:53.126 --> 04:54.294
Ah, thank you.

04:54.328 --> 04:58.031
And I got myself in front
of those files eventually.

05:03.103 --> 05:05.373
After I made my way
through all of them,

05:05.406 --> 05:07.375
Mike Ikerson was ready
to face the world a sober man.

05:07.408 --> 05:09.076
All right, thanks a lot!

05:09.109 --> 05:11.078
I feel a lot better.

05:12.446 --> 05:14.448
(ears ringing)

05:16.417 --> 05:18.886
WOMAN (distorted):
Sir, are you okay?

05:18.919 --> 05:20.921
Sir?

05:22.756 --> 05:24.725
It turns out there are
plenty of exciting reasons

05:24.758 --> 05:26.360
for sudden hearing
and vision changes--

05:26.394 --> 05:27.127
brain tumors.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.563
strokes... fun stuff.

05:29.597 --> 05:30.898
REBECCA:
Hey.

05:30.931 --> 05:32.032
Hey.

05:32.065 --> 05:33.434
Learn anything?

05:33.467 --> 05:34.568
Not a ton.

05:34.602 --> 05:36.370
I mean, your dad made it
all the way through treatment.

05:36.404 --> 05:37.671
With flying colors,

05:37.705 --> 05:39.373
according to his file.

05:39.407 --> 05:41.875
My dad was good
at charming therapists.

05:41.909 --> 05:43.377
Is that it?

05:43.411 --> 05:44.778
Uh, there was one thing.

05:44.812 --> 05:47.515
Your dad had
this notation in his file.

05:47.548 --> 05:50.384
It said:
"Weekly consult with A.E."

05:50.418 --> 05:51.885
I read the files of
everyone who was there

05:51.919 --> 05:52.986
at the same time as him.

05:53.020 --> 05:55.523
There were only four people
who had that notation.

05:55.556 --> 05:57.458
Any idea what that means?

05:57.491 --> 05:59.159
Well, I mean, they're all
connected to your dad somehow.

05:59.192 --> 06:02.496
So if we could track one of them
down, maybe they know something.

06:02.530 --> 06:03.497
(distorted):
Well, give me the names.

06:03.531 --> 06:05.633
I have to digest

06:05.666 --> 06:07.935
this enormous thing by tomorrow,
but maybe I can help.

06:07.968 --> 06:09.503
(ears ringing)

06:09.537 --> 06:11.605
Brian?

06:11.639 --> 06:12.940
Are you okay?

06:12.973 --> 06:15.008
Yeah.

06:15.042 --> 06:16.510
Uh...

06:16.544 --> 06:17.978
Think I have bad sinuses
or something.

06:18.011 --> 06:19.179
Probably coming down
with a cold.

06:19.212 --> 06:21.114
You should go home.

06:22.583 --> 06:24.184
Oh, thank you for this.

06:24.217 --> 06:26.720
And for doing this.

06:26.754 --> 06:28.422
All of it.

06:33.627 --> 06:35.863
Bad sinuses?
Come on, man.

06:35.896 --> 06:38.499
You don't need the Internet
to know what's up with you.

06:38.532 --> 06:40.167
When you stole those files
from Naz's office,

06:40.200 --> 06:42.703
you remember that video
of the government NZT studies?

06:43.737 --> 06:45.138
Day 11 for preliminary

06:45.172 --> 06:47.074
human trials for NZT-48.

06:47.107 --> 06:49.076
In the last 24 hours,
four patients

06:49.109 --> 06:51.078
describe episodes
of metamorphopsia

06:51.111 --> 06:53.180
and concurrent aphasia.

06:53.213 --> 06:55.783
Yeah, she's talking
about distorted vision.

06:55.816 --> 06:58.819
Difficulty understanding speech.

06:58.852 --> 07:01.789
You're having
NZT side effects, buddy.

07:01.822 --> 07:04.958
Your immunity shot's
wearing off.

07:04.992 --> 07:06.494
Where's that booster shot
Sands promised you

07:06.527 --> 07:09.630
for committing treason?

07:29.182 --> 07:32.786
I was wondering how long
it take you to get in touch.

07:32.820 --> 07:34.488
How are you feeling, Brian?

07:34.522 --> 07:36.624
I need that shot.

07:36.657 --> 07:38.626
See any white flashes lately?

07:38.659 --> 07:40.828
Speech not sounding quite right?

07:40.861 --> 07:43.163
Why would you want me
to have side effects?

07:43.196 --> 07:46.166
We want to get you
in the right frame of mind.

07:47.835 --> 07:49.903
You see, the Senator
has a job for you.

07:49.937 --> 07:51.705
It's Rebecca Harris.

07:51.739 --> 07:55.175
I told Mr. Morra that you
were growing close to her.

07:55.208 --> 07:58.278
We're concerned
it's a distraction.

07:58.311 --> 08:00.948
What do you care?

08:00.981 --> 08:04.618
As long as I do what you say,
what do you care?

08:04.652 --> 08:08.622
There's also
the issue of her father.

08:08.656 --> 08:10.624
She has the potential

08:10.658 --> 08:12.726
to be uniquely motivated

08:12.760 --> 08:15.663
to investigate NZT.

08:15.696 --> 08:18.966
We'd prefer she didn't.

08:18.999 --> 08:22.903
We want her gone.

08:26.139 --> 08:28.676
(laughs)

08:28.709 --> 08:31.211
I'm not telling you
to murder her, mate.

08:31.244 --> 08:33.581
(exhales)

08:33.614 --> 08:35.783
Just get her away from you.

08:35.816 --> 08:39.687
If Agent Harris were
to be found in possession

08:39.720 --> 08:42.255
of those files
from Naz's office,

08:42.289 --> 08:45.125
I'd imagine
that would do the trick.

08:45.158 --> 08:47.595
So, you want me to frame her?

08:47.628 --> 08:49.897
That would get her
kicked out of the FBI.

08:49.930 --> 08:51.599
She'd go to jail.

08:51.632 --> 08:52.966
That's the idea.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.602
No.

08:54.635 --> 08:56.604
I'm not doing that ever.

08:56.637 --> 09:00.140
So, you're gonna have
to think of something else.

09:00.173 --> 09:03.176
You're thinking again, Brian?

09:03.210 --> 09:05.813
As always the only way

09:05.846 --> 09:08.682
is the way we prescribe.

09:11.685 --> 09:13.854
You feel some loyalty
to this woman.

09:13.887 --> 09:15.656
That's fine for now.

09:15.689 --> 09:17.858
In a day, two days?

09:17.891 --> 09:21.695
When it feels like
your brain is on fire?

09:21.729 --> 09:23.296
You'll be willing to skin

09:23.330 --> 09:25.733
Rebecca Harris alive
for that shot.

09:27.334 --> 09:29.703
Let's not have it
come to that, hey?

10:05.305 --> 10:07.941
Things are not
as they should be.

10:07.975 --> 10:09.777
Over the past week, subjects
have complained

10:09.810 --> 10:12.079
about memory loss,

10:12.112 --> 10:13.747
extreme paranoia...

10:13.781 --> 10:14.882
Get them out of me!

10:14.915 --> 10:15.916
We see signs of rapid aging

10:15.949 --> 10:18.285
and encroaching psychosis.

10:18.318 --> 10:19.953
Attempts to discontinue NZT use

10:19.987 --> 10:21.288
sent one patient
into a withdrawal

10:21.321 --> 10:23.156
so severe that
we currently have him

10:23.190 --> 10:25.659
in a medically induced coma.

10:25.693 --> 10:27.294
I found your microchip!

10:27.327 --> 10:29.296
It's unclear at present
what's more dangerous--

10:29.329 --> 10:31.398
providing the pills

10:31.431 --> 10:33.100
or withholding them.

10:34.802 --> 10:37.170
Problem?

10:37.204 --> 10:39.172
BRIAN: If I take that pill,
I get side effects.

10:39.206 --> 10:40.841
But if I want to be
smart enough

10:40.874 --> 10:42.743
to figure out
how to stop the side effects,

10:42.776 --> 10:45.145
I have to take the pill.

10:45.178 --> 10:46.947
Yeah, there's a problem.

10:46.980 --> 10:50.283
* Now you're gonna die.

10:54.855 --> 10:56.857
2ND BRIAN: Aren't you supposed
to be finding out

10:56.890 --> 10:57.925
what happened
to her dad?

10:57.958 --> 10:58.959
Yeah, I'll get to that.

10:58.992 --> 11:01.028
I'm in a little bit
of a situation at the moment.

11:01.061 --> 11:02.095
I noticed.

11:02.129 --> 11:04.364
Well, let's run your options.

11:04.397 --> 11:06.834
I could figure out
how to make

11:06.867 --> 11:09.937
whatever's in that shot
that Senator Morra gave me.

11:09.970 --> 11:12.806
Yeah, but...

11:12.840 --> 11:16.376
it took him months and millions
of dollars to do that.

11:16.409 --> 11:18.078
Doesn't work on
our timeline.

11:18.111 --> 11:20.814
I could find someone else
who has the shot.

11:20.848 --> 11:22.082
Okay, so who?

11:22.115 --> 11:24.952
If the government knew how to
make it, they wouldn't need you.

11:24.985 --> 11:27.420
What about
whoever invented NZT?

11:27.454 --> 11:29.322
Do you know who that is?

11:29.356 --> 11:31.925
Doubt it, 'cause if you know it,
I know it.

11:31.959 --> 11:34.061
And I don't know it.

11:35.095 --> 11:38.298
Okay, what if I just
stop taking NZT?

11:38.331 --> 11:40.734
Just walk away, quit.

11:40.768 --> 11:42.202
Sure.

11:42.235 --> 11:43.971
Then the government
throws you in jail

11:44.004 --> 11:45.205
for violating your
agreement with them.

11:45.238 --> 11:46.907
If the withdrawal
doesn't kill you first.

11:48.208 --> 11:50.010
Devil's advocate?

11:50.043 --> 11:51.945
What if you do
what Sands wants?

11:51.979 --> 11:53.413
You mean throw Rebecca
under the bus?

11:53.446 --> 11:55.082
Not an option.

11:55.115 --> 11:56.116
Okay, so what, then?

11:56.149 --> 11:59.452
Die a slow and mind-bendingly
terrible death?

11:59.486 --> 12:02.289
Really not an option.

12:02.322 --> 12:04.958
Okay. What if I go
straight to Senator Morra?

12:04.992 --> 12:06.994
Maybe he and I can
work something out

12:07.027 --> 12:08.461
that doesn't mean
sending Rebecca to jail.

12:08.495 --> 12:10.463
It's risky.

12:10.497 --> 12:13.466
Every time you go around
Sands, bad things happen.

12:13.500 --> 12:16.303
Worse than a slow,
mind-bendingly terrible death?

12:16.336 --> 12:18.906
(sighs heavily)

12:18.939 --> 12:21.875
How do you even get close
to someone like Senator Morra?

12:21.909 --> 12:23.043
BRIAN:
It's not easy to get to him,

12:23.076 --> 12:25.378
but it might be possible
to talk to people close to him.

12:25.412 --> 12:27.547
Hi there.
So I have footage

12:27.580 --> 12:30.117
of Senator Morra in bed
with the majority leader's wife.

12:30.150 --> 12:32.452
A third party jumps
in there too after a while.

12:32.485 --> 12:34.487
Not sure who
that is yet.

12:34.521 --> 12:36.256
I was gonna put it
on the market.

12:36.289 --> 12:39.226
Unless somebody here wants
to make a pre-emptive bid?

12:39.259 --> 12:41.461
Wait for it.

12:43.363 --> 12:44.865
Any minute now.

12:46.333 --> 12:47.200
(screaming)

12:47.234 --> 12:48.335
(people scream)

12:51.004 --> 12:52.572
Ha-ha! It's a screamer!

12:52.605 --> 12:53.573
Got you!

12:53.606 --> 12:55.943
So no, I didn't have video of

12:55.976 --> 12:57.110
Eddie Morra having a threesome.

12:57.144 --> 12:58.812
But by the time
I left his offices,

12:58.846 --> 13:00.147
I had something almost as good:

13:00.180 --> 13:02.850
a cell phone belonging to the
director of his field office,

13:02.883 --> 13:05.853
whose son's birthday, I saw
on her calendar, is April 10.

13:07.888 --> 13:09.857
Mr. Morra, it's Brian Finch.

13:09.890 --> 13:13.060
It's urgent that we speak.
Just you and me. Please.

13:13.093 --> 13:15.095
(distorted ringing)

13:21.001 --> 13:23.103
(distorted siren wailing)

13:28.141 --> 13:29.442
Whoa.

13:30.610 --> 13:33.013
Subject 12 complains
of time displacement.

13:35.148 --> 13:36.950
BRIAN:
Text from Edward Morra.

13:36.984 --> 13:38.518
That was
the only response I got.

13:38.551 --> 13:41.221
All I could do was wait.

13:41.254 --> 13:43.056
(sighs)

13:43.090 --> 13:45.592
Welcome to the red team.

13:45.625 --> 13:47.094
We are a group of

13:47.127 --> 13:48.896
Chinese-sponsored saboteurs

13:48.929 --> 13:52.199
with a mandate
to destroy the U.S. economy,

13:52.232 --> 13:54.167
and we've got the first move.

13:54.201 --> 13:56.203
Anyone?

13:58.105 --> 14:00.473
Are you really gonna
make me call on someone?

14:00.507 --> 14:02.042
Rebecca Harris,

14:02.075 --> 14:04.511
who works with me here
at the CJC in New York--

14:04.544 --> 14:07.915
she had some interesting
thoughts during prep.

14:07.948 --> 14:10.250
PAULSON:
Is that true, Agent Harris?

14:13.553 --> 14:16.156
If the question is:
how do we destroy the economy

14:16.189 --> 14:17.991
with the resources we've got,

14:18.025 --> 14:20.027
we can't.

14:22.029 --> 14:23.163
Anyone else?

14:23.196 --> 14:24.231
In the current conditions,

14:24.264 --> 14:27.034
we have enough manpower
to launch one sabotage op,

14:27.067 --> 14:29.102
if we aren't too ambitious.

14:29.136 --> 14:31.271
We need to create
more resources.

14:31.304 --> 14:32.973
We need protestors and looters.

14:33.006 --> 14:34.141
We need chaos.

14:34.174 --> 14:35.976
We can use social
media to spread rumors

14:36.009 --> 14:37.644
that cops are
cracking down.

14:37.677 --> 14:39.646
We would need an image that
would galvanize people,

14:39.679 --> 14:44.051
so I say we stage a photo
of a cop in riot gear

14:44.084 --> 14:47.220
shooting a
community leader.

14:47.254 --> 14:49.022
And how do we stage that?

14:49.056 --> 14:53.126
However we have to, even if
we have to shoot someone.

14:53.160 --> 14:55.662
Your, um, protГ©gГ© comes to play.

14:58.565 --> 15:02.069
BRIAN: Still waiting
to hear something,

15:02.102 --> 15:05.005
anything, from Senator Morra.

15:05.038 --> 15:07.240
I mean, he can't even text me?

15:07.274 --> 15:08.341
What the...
REBECCA: Brian?

15:08.375 --> 15:09.576
Hey.

15:11.611 --> 15:13.246
Are you feeling okay?

15:13.280 --> 15:14.347
What?

15:14.381 --> 15:16.683
Yeah, I just had some hot tea.
It's for my sinuses.

15:16.716 --> 15:18.385
Oh, hey, how'd
it go today?

15:18.418 --> 15:20.353
Conquering New York and whatnot.

15:20.387 --> 15:22.990
Are you ruling from atop
a pile of human skulls?

15:23.023 --> 15:24.391
Not yet.

15:24.424 --> 15:25.725
I did bond with Naz though.

15:25.758 --> 15:27.660
At least she thinks we bonded.

15:27.694 --> 15:28.461
Well, let her.

15:28.495 --> 15:30.097
She has to think
things are normal.

15:30.130 --> 15:32.032
Well, things are
anything but normal.

15:32.065 --> 15:34.101
Speaking of which,
I did some research today.

15:34.134 --> 15:36.303
That's my father.
Yeah.

15:36.336 --> 15:40.040
I tracked down those people
from your dad's rehab group.

15:40.073 --> 15:41.674
All of them were
at absolute bottom

15:41.708 --> 15:43.510
when they went into treatment
at New Springs.

15:43.543 --> 15:45.412
Your dad had
just been arrested.

15:45.445 --> 15:47.981
Marcus Tate had
his third DUI.

15:48.015 --> 15:49.382
Susan Epstein's own daughter

15:49.416 --> 15:51.518
left her on the sidewalk
outside of an E.R.

15:51.551 --> 15:53.453
But the moment
they got out,

15:53.486 --> 15:55.188
(snaps fingers)
things changed.

15:55.222 --> 15:56.523
Your father started
painting again.

15:56.556 --> 15:59.993
Marcus Tate was a contractor
before he was an addict.

16:00.027 --> 16:01.328
After he got out of rehab,

16:01.361 --> 16:03.630
he rebuilt his family's house
from the ground up.

16:03.663 --> 16:05.732
He built that by himself?
Mm-hmm.

16:05.765 --> 16:08.635
Jeremy Dyer-- he was awarded
four patents in the first

16:08.668 --> 16:10.470
six months
he got clean.

16:10.503 --> 16:13.006
He sold one for $11 million.

16:13.040 --> 16:15.042
I mean, everyone who was
at that weekly consult

16:15.075 --> 16:17.277
with A.E. in rehab turned
their lives around completely.

16:17.310 --> 16:19.612
You think they were all on NZT.
Mm-hmm.

16:19.646 --> 16:21.514
These five people were
the only ones at New Springs

16:21.548 --> 16:23.083
who turned their lives
around like that.

16:23.116 --> 16:25.185
But they did have
one other thing in common.

16:25.218 --> 16:26.286
They all went missing?

16:26.319 --> 16:27.420
Gone without a trace.

16:27.454 --> 16:29.422
The only one I could actually
account for is your dad,

16:29.456 --> 16:30.423
and that's just because

16:30.457 --> 16:31.324
he was...

16:31.358 --> 16:33.426
He turned up
in the East River.
Mm-hmm.

16:33.460 --> 16:35.462
They all disappeared
within a month of each other?

16:35.495 --> 16:36.463
Mm-hmm.

16:36.496 --> 16:38.231
613 Lexington Avenue?

16:38.265 --> 16:39.566
Yeah, so I went to see

16:39.599 --> 16:41.201
the families of everyone here.

16:41.234 --> 16:43.103
I dug through
anything they had saved--

16:43.136 --> 16:45.272
cell phones,
address books, calendars.

16:45.305 --> 16:47.107
After their time
at New Springs,

16:47.140 --> 16:49.109
they all went their
separate ways.

16:49.142 --> 16:52.679
Except, once a week, they
all met at that address.

16:52.712 --> 16:54.247
What's there?

16:54.281 --> 16:56.516
I'll show you.

17:04.091 --> 17:06.093
TV NARRATOR: The story of Ubient
is not just a story

17:06.126 --> 17:07.760
of pharmaceutical manufacturing,

17:07.794 --> 17:09.796
it's the story of
a small group of people

17:09.829 --> 17:12.565
who took their fascination
with unlocking the potential

17:12.599 --> 17:15.668
of the human brain
to the world stage.

17:15.702 --> 17:18.171
Our passion
for neuropharmacology

17:18.205 --> 17:21.441
informs every decision
that we make, from finding...

17:21.474 --> 17:23.576
So my dad and
all the others--

17:23.610 --> 17:25.245
they were taking NZT,
and once a week,

17:25.278 --> 17:26.779
they went to an office
for a company

17:26.813 --> 17:28.415
that made neuroenhancers?

17:28.448 --> 17:31.384
Do you think they
were studying NZT?

17:31.418 --> 17:33.420
What if they're the ones
who invented it?

17:34.487 --> 17:38.091
We need to figure
out who "A.E." is.

17:38.125 --> 17:39.092
(sighs)

17:39.126 --> 17:40.227
BRIAN:
Yeah, no kidding.

17:40.260 --> 17:41.361
If that company knows
about NZT,

17:41.394 --> 17:43.396
then they might know
what happened to Rebecca's dad,

17:43.430 --> 17:46.299
and they might know how to stop
these side effects, too.

17:46.333 --> 17:47.734
Senator Morra's gone silent.

17:47.767 --> 17:50.570
So if anyone's gonna help me,
it's these guys.

18:03.450 --> 18:05.252
BRIAN:
Side effects may include...

18:05.285 --> 18:06.819
Memory loss, extreme paranoia,

18:06.853 --> 18:09.122
rapid aging,
encroaching psychosis.

18:23.270 --> 18:24.204
"Andrew Epperly."

18:24.237 --> 18:25.905
I did a lot of digging around
last night.

18:25.938 --> 18:28.475
There are plenty of people
with the initials A.E.

18:28.508 --> 18:30.843
that work at Ubient,
but I think this is our guy.

18:30.877 --> 18:32.745
Neurochemist?
Harvard, MIT.

18:32.779 --> 18:35.415
His name is on
all these research papers--

18:35.448 --> 18:37.450
neurochemical regulation
of sleep,

18:37.484 --> 18:39.652
chemical synapse manipulation.

18:39.686 --> 18:42.455
This one is on the human trials
he ran at Ubient

18:42.489 --> 18:44.257
with drugs on dementia.

18:44.291 --> 18:45.525
Wait, whoa.
Human trials?

18:46.959 --> 18:48.761
What if your dad
and those patients

18:48.795 --> 18:50.463
were part of some
kind of trial?

18:50.497 --> 18:51.464
You know, for NZT.

18:51.498 --> 18:53.766
I mean, if Andrew Epperly
was running them,

18:53.800 --> 18:56.536
maybe that's why he went
to see them at New Springs.

18:56.569 --> 18:58.371
It's too bad we can't ask him.

18:58.405 --> 18:59.572
He's dead.

18:59.606 --> 19:00.873
He died in
a boating accident

19:00.907 --> 19:02.642
off the coast of Maine
last year.

19:07.447 --> 19:08.415
Well, you know...

19:08.448 --> 19:09.449
(sighs)

19:09.482 --> 19:11.618
...even if he was running
some kind of trial,

19:11.651 --> 19:14.187
he wouldn't have been
able to do it by himself.

19:14.221 --> 19:17.690
There's got to be someone else
at Ubient that knows something.

19:17.724 --> 19:19.392
Let me know what you find out.

19:19.426 --> 19:20.527
I've got to go.
Yeah.

19:27.934 --> 19:29.569
BOYLE:
Hey, Finch.

19:29.602 --> 19:30.570
Finch.

19:30.603 --> 19:31.804
Hey.

19:31.838 --> 19:33.573
Boyle, what's up, man?

19:33.606 --> 19:34.607
Hey, well, you know,
I'm covering a couple

19:34.641 --> 19:35.742
of Rebecca's cases
while she's out,

19:35.775 --> 19:37.544
Mm-hmm.
and I'm hitting
a little bit

19:37.577 --> 19:39.712
(distorted): of a wall on
this Moldovan bank fraud.

19:39.746 --> 19:40.880
Can you take a look
at these transactions,

19:40.913 --> 19:42.915
see if they make
any sense to you?

19:45.652 --> 19:47.287
Uh, yeah, of course.

19:47.320 --> 19:48.588
I'm actually really glad
you asked.

19:48.621 --> 19:49.589
I'll get right on that.

19:49.622 --> 19:51.558
Thanks.

19:51.591 --> 19:53.226
What?

19:53.260 --> 19:54.761
Do I have something on my face?

19:54.794 --> 19:57.230
(quietly):
No.

20:02.635 --> 20:04.771
(echoing):
You okay?

20:04.804 --> 20:08.708
WILSON: Extreme paranoia
and encroaching psychosis.

20:10.343 --> 20:11.644
Yeah. Sorry.

20:11.678 --> 20:12.979
(chuckles):
I'm... fine.

20:13.012 --> 20:14.381
Mm-hmm.

20:14.414 --> 20:15.582
Okay. All right.

20:15.615 --> 20:18.385
Anyway, um...
thanks for the help.

20:18.418 --> 20:19.719
Mm-hmm.

20:24.324 --> 20:26.693
Hi. I need to speak
to someone important.

20:26.726 --> 20:28.361
I'm sorry, sir.
Do you have an appointment?

20:28.395 --> 20:30.697
No, I don't, but just tell
them I'm here to speak about

20:30.730 --> 20:32.632
Andrew Epperly's
NZT trials.

20:32.665 --> 20:35.568
Wow. You guys really do
look important.

20:35.602 --> 20:37.570
Now, I'm sure
you're all very busy

20:37.604 --> 20:40.740
running Ubient Pharmaceutical,
so let's save us all some time.

20:40.773 --> 20:43.810
I know your company
was researching NZT.

20:43.843 --> 20:45.478
Sir, we have never heard

20:45.512 --> 20:46.646
of NZT.

20:48.448 --> 20:50.283
(chuckles)

20:50.317 --> 20:52.719
If that was true, I wouldn't
have made it past reception.

20:54.086 --> 20:58.691
Now, I know Andrew Epperly
was conducting human trials.

20:58.725 --> 21:00.026
MAN: Andrew Epperly
is not an employee

21:00.059 --> 21:01.828
of Ubient Pharmaceutical.

21:01.861 --> 21:05.532
While he was an employee
of Ubient Pharmaceutical.

21:05.565 --> 21:07.667
I need to see
his research,

21:07.700 --> 21:10.470
specifically anything on

21:10.503 --> 21:12.004
counteracting the side effects
of NZT.

21:12.038 --> 21:13.072
(clears throat)

21:13.105 --> 21:14.874
And I need any
records you have

21:14.907 --> 21:17.377
of the trial participants,
specifically

21:17.410 --> 21:19.412
Conrad Harris.

21:19.446 --> 21:21.514
Give me those things,
and I don't

21:21.548 --> 21:22.649
go to the press
with this.

21:22.682 --> 21:26.919
Sir, there was no trial of
any drug called NZT at Ubient.

21:26.953 --> 21:29.556
Andrew Epperly

21:29.589 --> 21:30.823
enjoyed a tremendous degree

21:30.857 --> 21:32.759
of autonomy while
he worked here.

21:32.792 --> 21:34.694
(echoing):
Which, I should add,

21:34.727 --> 21:35.662
he no longer does.

21:35.695 --> 21:37.564
(distorted):
Dr. Epperly

21:37.597 --> 21:40.367
tragically passed away
last year.

21:40.400 --> 21:43.470
MAN (distorted):
I'm sorry.

21:43.503 --> 21:44.704
We can't help you.

21:44.737 --> 21:46.906
(distorted voices continue)

21:53.380 --> 21:55.982
(groans)

21:56.015 --> 21:58.618
Are you all right?

21:58.651 --> 22:01.087
I take it you've all read
the blue team's response

22:01.120 --> 22:03.356
to our opening salvo.

22:03.390 --> 22:06.459
Or, should I say, Agent Harris'.

22:06.493 --> 22:07.827
The, um,
protesters are now

22:07.860 --> 22:09.962
up against around-the-clock
NYPD patrols

22:09.996 --> 22:11.464
and a citywide curfew.

22:11.498 --> 22:12.632
If we organize the protesters,

22:12.665 --> 22:14.601
that might mean more.

22:14.634 --> 22:16.603
That's easier said than done,
of course, but I...

22:16.636 --> 22:17.637
(cell phone buzzes)

22:20.006 --> 22:21.941
Agent Harris?

22:21.974 --> 22:24.110
Excuse me.

22:30.717 --> 22:32.018
Are you okay?

22:32.051 --> 22:33.553
BRIAN:
They know, Rebecca.

22:33.586 --> 22:35.021
I was in there
with the top people,

22:35.054 --> 22:38.024
and they were pretending
not to know what NZT is.

22:38.057 --> 22:40.026
They were saying that Epperly
doesn't work there anymore,

22:40.059 --> 22:41.794
that there never was
any research,

22:41.828 --> 22:43.663
and he's dead now.

22:43.696 --> 22:45.465
Brian, slow down.

22:45.498 --> 22:47.467
Look, they clearly
don't want anyone

22:47.500 --> 22:51.771
to make any association
between Ubient and NZT.

22:51.804 --> 22:53.172
I think they might have done
something to Epperly

22:53.205 --> 22:55.174
and, who knows, maybe all
of those research patients.

22:55.207 --> 22:58.177
But I know the research
is in there.

22:58.210 --> 23:01.047
I just got to get back inside
and find the records.

23:01.080 --> 23:02.048
Are you sure?

23:02.081 --> 23:03.583
You sound strange?

23:03.616 --> 23:04.617
I'm fine.

23:20.767 --> 23:21.768
(bell rings)

23:42.789 --> 23:44.891
(cell phone chimes)

24:01.574 --> 24:03.009
What the hell?

24:03.042 --> 24:04.911
Sorry?

24:06.946 --> 24:08.047
Wh-What's going on?

24:08.080 --> 24:10.783
What am I doing here?

24:10.817 --> 24:11.918
You wanted to meet.

24:11.951 --> 24:13.620
Or so you texted.

24:16.623 --> 24:18.691
BRIAN:
I texted Senator Morra.

24:19.859 --> 24:22.161
So here we are.

24:22.194 --> 24:24.163
You were just telling me
you haven't done what I asked,

24:24.196 --> 24:26.633
regarding Agent Harris.

24:26.666 --> 24:28.635
No.

24:28.668 --> 24:29.769
No, I haven't.

24:29.802 --> 24:31.738
I can't. I can't do that.

24:31.771 --> 24:34.641
There must be some other
way that doesn't...

24:34.674 --> 24:35.775
mean ruining her life.

24:35.808 --> 24:37.009
Excuse me.

24:50.857 --> 24:52.825
It's only gonna get worse.

24:52.859 --> 24:55.828
It'll be tomorrow's pill
or the next one,

24:55.862 --> 24:58.531
but you keep
going on like this,

24:58.565 --> 25:02.001
one of these days,
Brian Finch is going away,

25:02.034 --> 25:03.670
and he's never coming back.

25:03.703 --> 25:06.839
It's time to think
about you now.

25:06.873 --> 25:10.943
Rebecca can't save you, Brian.

25:10.977 --> 25:12.979
Only you can.

25:27.126 --> 25:28.260
Where the hell
did you go yesterday?

25:28.294 --> 25:30.262
You hung up on me, you didn't
answer your phone all night.

25:30.296 --> 25:31.798
What...?

25:31.831 --> 25:33.132
(groans)

25:33.165 --> 25:36.035
What's going on?

25:36.068 --> 25:38.037
I had a rough night.

25:38.070 --> 25:39.138
Are you sick?

25:39.171 --> 25:42.174
I don't know,
I-I just feel weird.

25:43.976 --> 25:45.945
I may need
to stop taking NZT.

25:45.978 --> 25:48.180
I'm gonna make you
a doctor's appointment.

25:48.214 --> 25:49.215
No, no, no, no, no.

25:49.248 --> 25:50.683
Yes.

25:52.719 --> 25:54.687
BRIAN: As soon as I get called
into that doctor's office,

25:54.721 --> 25:56.022
it's game over.

25:56.055 --> 25:57.690
The FBI is gonna know
I'm not really immune.

25:57.724 --> 26:00.059
I'll go to jail.

26:00.092 --> 26:01.861
What?

26:04.931 --> 26:07.366
I have to figure out
where that note came from.

26:07.399 --> 26:09.235
If Epperly's alive,

26:09.268 --> 26:11.370
he might have the enzyme
to reverse the side effects.

26:11.403 --> 26:13.906
(elevator dings)
He might know what happened
to Rebecca's dad.

26:13.940 --> 26:15.942
I need NZT for this.

26:38.164 --> 26:39.832
Something wrong?

26:42.702 --> 26:45.337
No.

26:45.371 --> 26:47.707
It's regulation NZT pill.

27:00.887 --> 27:02.822
BRIAN: This pill
is the best shot I have

27:02.855 --> 27:04.824
at remembering
where this came from.

27:04.857 --> 27:08.260
And hopefully it doesn't plunge
me into permanent psychosis.

27:08.961 --> 27:10.697
(car honks)

27:10.730 --> 27:12.364
So sorry you're going
through this. Thank you.

27:18.838 --> 27:21.140
That woman from Ubient.

27:21.173 --> 27:23.175
She wrote the note.

27:27.146 --> 27:30.249
Oh, hey, I was just
coming to find you.

27:30.282 --> 27:32.351
What the hell?

27:32.384 --> 27:35.254
What's the matter with you?

27:35.287 --> 27:37.924
Sorry, man, I'm just
a little bit jumpy.

27:37.957 --> 27:39.926
By the blue team's own estimate,

27:39.959 --> 27:42.428
our uprising will be crushed
within a matter of hours.

27:42.461 --> 27:44.296
What if we distract them?

27:44.330 --> 27:46.165
And how do you propose
distracting

27:46.198 --> 27:47.834
the entire U.S. military?

27:47.867 --> 27:49.168
Right.

27:49.201 --> 27:50.469
Plan C.

27:50.502 --> 27:52.471
During the Cold War,
the FBI was rumored to keep

27:52.504 --> 27:54.273
a list of names of people
that were to be rounded up

27:54.306 --> 27:57.009
in the event of a
crisis like this.

27:57.043 --> 28:00.847
Politicians, artists,
uh, even foreign diplomats.

28:00.880 --> 28:03.215
Anyone who could
be labeled subversive.

28:03.249 --> 28:05.217
What if we leak a list
of names like this,

28:05.251 --> 28:06.385
with millions of people on it?

28:06.418 --> 28:09.388
We could turn half the country
against the government.

28:09.421 --> 28:11.390
And foreign countries
would mobilize

28:11.423 --> 28:12.291
to protect their
diplomats.

28:12.324 --> 28:14.360
A multifront conflict.

28:14.393 --> 28:17.229
Agent Harris,

28:17.263 --> 28:19.732
remind me to never get
on your bad side.

28:22.234 --> 28:24.203
KAREN: I will never admit
to having this conversation.

28:24.236 --> 28:25.504
You need to know that.

28:25.537 --> 28:28.040
Andrew Epperly came
to me a while back.

28:28.074 --> 28:30.176
He said needed funds

28:30.209 --> 28:32.311
for some study that
would change everything.

28:32.344 --> 28:34.246
He didn't give
me any details.

28:34.280 --> 28:35.381
I gave him the money.

28:35.414 --> 28:37.383
I didn't ask
any questions.

28:37.416 --> 28:39.351
Okay, and that was
an NZT study?

28:39.385 --> 28:42.221
We didn't know
about it until...

28:42.254 --> 28:44.356
until after the first
test subject disappeared.

28:44.390 --> 28:46.893
Andrew was panicked,
we panicked.

28:46.926 --> 28:49.128
W-We destroyed
all the research

28:49.161 --> 28:51.130
right before Andrew
disappeared.

28:51.163 --> 28:54.466
W-W... Why do you think
Epperly's still alive?

28:54.500 --> 28:57.136
About six months
after he died,

28:57.169 --> 28:58.470
I got a letter at home.

28:58.504 --> 29:01.473
No postmark, no
return address.

29:01.507 --> 29:04.476
It just said, "You're
not guilty of anything.

29:04.510 --> 29:05.511
I am."

29:06.946 --> 29:08.915
I think he faked his
own death, disappeared,

29:08.948 --> 29:10.382
so he could get away
from everything.

29:10.416 --> 29:12.451
Did he know how to stop
the side effects?

29:12.484 --> 29:13.485
I don't know.

29:13.519 --> 29:16.455
If you can find Andrew,
maybe he can help you.

29:16.488 --> 29:18.324
Good luck.
God.

29:22.494 --> 29:24.330
BRIAN: Do you really have
the time to find a guy

29:24.363 --> 29:26.332
who doesn't want
to be found?

29:26.365 --> 29:29.001
I don't have a choice!

29:29.035 --> 29:30.469
Rebecca.

29:30.502 --> 29:32.004
If it's you or her?

29:32.038 --> 29:34.040
Personally,
I'm a fan of you.

29:37.409 --> 29:39.378
I'm going to find Epperly.

29:39.411 --> 29:41.413
If he's really alive,
he's the key to everything.

29:44.250 --> 29:47.219
NAZ: Word is
out about you.

29:47.253 --> 29:50.522
Your countermeasure made it
all the way up the ladder.

29:50.556 --> 29:52.058
To the director.

29:52.091 --> 29:54.060
Wow, I mean...

29:54.093 --> 29:55.394
How?

29:55.427 --> 29:57.529
Apparently, Director Avery
decided to participate

29:57.563 --> 30:01.500
in the exercise this year,
return to his roots.

30:01.533 --> 30:03.502
He was playing
for the blue team.

30:03.535 --> 30:06.038
I didn't realize...

30:06.072 --> 30:10.076
I... I wouldn't have said all
of those things about Plan C.

30:10.109 --> 30:11.310
Well, he called me directly,

30:11.343 --> 30:13.312
said he loved your
countermeasure

30:13.345 --> 30:14.914
and your ability to think
outside of the box.

30:14.947 --> 30:16.548
And he wants to meet you.

30:16.582 --> 30:17.549
Tomorrow.

30:17.583 --> 30:20.552
Oh, wow.

30:20.586 --> 30:21.888
But that's sudden, I'm...

30:21.921 --> 30:24.390
(cell phone buzzes)

30:27.359 --> 30:29.028
Will you excuse me
just a moment?

30:32.664 --> 30:34.166
Where are you?

30:34.200 --> 30:35.634
I got a text from Boyle
that you were acting weird.

30:35.667 --> 30:37.336
You have to be
a little smoother.

30:37.369 --> 30:38.337
BRIAN: You need to go see
Andrew Epperly.

30:38.370 --> 30:39.906
I'm sending you his address.

30:39.939 --> 30:41.607
Epperly's dead.

30:41.640 --> 30:43.142
Brian, why did you leave

30:43.175 --> 30:44.476
your doctor's appointment
this morning?

30:44.510 --> 30:46.078
Epperly faked his death.

30:46.112 --> 30:48.080
He's in Connecticut.

30:48.114 --> 30:49.515
He's living under the name

30:49.548 --> 30:51.150
Daniel Kennedy.

30:51.183 --> 30:52.484
We can drive up there tonight.

30:52.518 --> 30:53.452
I can't go.

30:53.485 --> 30:55.487
I'm sick or something.

30:55.521 --> 30:58.324
Okay, I'm coming to get you.

30:58.357 --> 31:00.459
If-if there's something
wrong, we need to...

31:00.492 --> 31:01.560
Rebecca, go to Epperly.

31:01.593 --> 31:03.029
Find out about your dad.

31:03.062 --> 31:06.365
Ask him for anything he knows,

31:06.398 --> 31:08.367
everything he knows, about NZT,

31:08.400 --> 31:11.437
everything about
the side effects of NZT,

31:11.470 --> 31:12.571
if there's a way
to reverse them.

31:12.604 --> 31:13.572
Are you having side effects?

31:13.605 --> 31:14.573
(Brian groans)

31:14.606 --> 31:15.607
Is that what's going on?

31:15.641 --> 31:17.109
Just go, okay?

31:17.143 --> 31:18.477
Just please stay on the phone.

31:18.510 --> 31:20.346
I'll find you, and we can
figure this out.

31:20.379 --> 31:22.114
(groans)

31:22.148 --> 31:23.349
Bri...

31:23.382 --> 31:25.017
(cell phone chimes)

31:27.053 --> 31:28.520
BRIAN: This is Brian,
leave a message.

31:35.061 --> 31:36.495
NAZ:
Rebecca.

31:36.528 --> 31:39.365
Is everything okay?

31:39.398 --> 31:42.568
Is there any way we can
postpone this meeting?

31:42.601 --> 31:44.570
It's very sudden.

31:44.603 --> 31:47.573
Rebecca, when the director
of the FBI wants to meet you,

31:47.606 --> 31:49.575
you meet the director.

31:49.608 --> 31:53.112
Don't worry, I'll have
Jordan find you a train.

31:53.145 --> 31:55.114
Great.

31:55.147 --> 31:57.616
I just need to go home
and pack a bag then.

32:02.621 --> 32:04.623
Brian?

32:08.160 --> 32:10.162
Where the hell are you?

32:16.635 --> 32:20.606
Yes, this is Agent Rebecca
Harris from the CJC in New York.

32:20.639 --> 32:22.608
I'm supposed to meet with
the director in the morning,

32:22.641 --> 32:26.278
but... unfortunately
something has come up.

32:26.312 --> 32:28.414
*

32:29.581 --> 32:30.616
Things are not
as they should be.

32:30.649 --> 32:31.783
Hey!

32:34.686 --> 32:37.189
WILSON: Subjects have complained
about memory loss,

32:37.223 --> 32:38.490
extreme paranoia.

32:38.524 --> 32:40.459
Brian's not safe.

32:41.627 --> 32:42.694
Oh!

32:42.728 --> 32:44.530
Watch it, man!

32:44.563 --> 32:48.234
*

32:48.267 --> 32:51.303
Brian, they're
trying to kill you.

32:51.337 --> 32:53.072
(grunts)

33:19.831 --> 33:22.401
(door opens)

33:22.434 --> 33:24.170
Who the hell are you?

33:25.504 --> 33:27.439
My name is Rebecca Harris.

33:27.473 --> 33:30.509
And if I were you, I wouldn't
shoot a federal agent.

33:30.542 --> 33:32.478
You're Conrad's daughter.

33:42.254 --> 33:45.691
We almost lost you there, Brian.

33:57.103 --> 33:58.404
Don't worry.

33:58.437 --> 34:00.772
You're gonna be just fine.

34:02.808 --> 34:05.711
Take it slow.

34:05.744 --> 34:09.115
Been through a lot.

34:09.148 --> 34:10.449
Hit your head pretty good,

34:10.482 --> 34:11.850
but you're gonna be okay
once the shot kicks in.

34:11.883 --> 34:13.585
No, no, no, no.

34:13.619 --> 34:15.154
Brian, it's okay.

34:15.187 --> 34:16.188
It's over.

34:16.222 --> 34:18.524
I'm not gonna frame Rebecca.

34:18.557 --> 34:20.092
I know.

34:20.126 --> 34:22.294
I never thought you would.

34:22.328 --> 34:25.264
What?

34:25.297 --> 34:27.699
I didn't think you'd do it.

34:27.733 --> 34:31.103
I just needed to know
what your limits are.

34:31.137 --> 34:32.604
If you're somebody who just
takes orders like Sands,

34:32.638 --> 34:35.207
or if you're somebody who has...

34:35.241 --> 34:37.576
character.

34:37.609 --> 34:39.245
So, what?

34:39.278 --> 34:42.648
That was some kind of a test?

34:42.681 --> 34:44.650
I could've died.

34:44.683 --> 34:46.485
I would never
let that happen to you.

34:46.518 --> 34:47.753
And what about her Rebecca?

34:47.786 --> 34:49.621
Uh, her dad was taking NZT.

34:49.655 --> 34:52.324
She's not gonna
just let that go.

34:52.358 --> 34:54.126
I'm not worried about Rebecca.

34:54.160 --> 34:55.494
This is about you, Brian.

34:55.527 --> 34:57.729
About whether you're
just an employee

34:57.763 --> 34:59.731
or you're somebody

34:59.765 --> 35:02.134
who can be a partner.

35:02.168 --> 35:04.303
A partner?

35:05.204 --> 35:06.705
You threatened my family.

35:06.738 --> 35:09.275
You threatened my friends.

35:09.308 --> 35:11.777
All you've ever seen
is the ugly side of what we do.

35:11.810 --> 35:14.213
But there's so much more, Brian.

35:15.847 --> 35:19.518
There's rice?

35:19.551 --> 35:22.154
This rice contains
a complete nutritional profile.

35:22.188 --> 35:23.889
Everything the human body needs.

35:23.922 --> 35:26.292
It can grow
in the harshest environments.

35:26.325 --> 35:28.927
Places we need it
the most.

35:28.960 --> 35:31.197
With a little more research,
this rice...

35:31.230 --> 35:32.798
could feed the entire world.

35:35.367 --> 35:36.435
I don't understand.

35:36.468 --> 35:38.404
Why can't you
tell anyone about it?

35:38.437 --> 35:40.272
I mean, if that's true,

35:40.306 --> 35:40.972
why aren't you shouting
it from the rooftops?

35:41.006 --> 35:42.774
Because people won't want it.

35:42.808 --> 35:44.243
I make
an announcement.

35:44.276 --> 35:45.511
Lobbyists
bring it to action.

35:45.544 --> 35:47.779
People rave over GMO's
and it's buried.

35:51.350 --> 35:52.784
Science can't change
the world on its own.

35:52.818 --> 35:54.820
The world needs
to be willing to change.

35:54.853 --> 35:57.956
And it takes leaders.

35:57.989 --> 35:59.391
Leaders who are willing

35:59.425 --> 36:00.459
to chip away at the obstacles,

36:00.492 --> 36:01.527
cut through the noise

36:01.560 --> 36:03.395
and play the game.

36:03.429 --> 36:05.464
And win the game.

36:05.497 --> 36:08.334
And that's you?

36:08.367 --> 36:10.302
I think so.

36:10.336 --> 36:11.770
With people like you
helping me,

36:11.803 --> 36:14.640
I think so.

36:14.673 --> 36:17.676
I mean what I say
about wanting a partner.

36:21.247 --> 36:23.382
Five NZT pills.

36:23.415 --> 36:25.584
Those weren't just hollow words.

36:27.419 --> 36:28.587
What are those for?

36:29.821 --> 36:31.757
Whatever you want.

36:34.526 --> 36:37.263
Think of it
as discretionary funds.

36:38.464 --> 36:40.699
A token of my...

36:40.732 --> 36:43.802
trust in your judgment.

36:48.607 --> 36:51.443
I need you to tell me
everything you know about NZT.

36:51.477 --> 36:53.479
The side effects,
how to reverse them.

36:53.512 --> 36:54.646
I don't know of any way.

36:54.680 --> 36:55.981
You studied it.

36:56.014 --> 36:57.416
You ran trials.

36:57.449 --> 36:58.450
You gave it to my father.

36:58.484 --> 37:00.286
To other patients.

37:00.319 --> 37:01.820
Did the NZT side effects
kill them?

37:01.853 --> 37:03.322
Is that what happened?

37:03.355 --> 37:04.790
It's not like that.

37:04.823 --> 37:06.892
They were side effects, yes.

37:06.925 --> 37:08.994
But I didn't know anything
about them at the time.

37:09.027 --> 37:11.930
And the NZT helped them, too.

37:11.963 --> 37:14.466
I was trying to help people.

37:14.500 --> 37:15.934
My father's dead.

37:15.967 --> 37:17.536
I know that.

37:17.569 --> 37:19.338
But the NZT did not kill him.

37:19.371 --> 37:20.472
Then what happened?

37:20.506 --> 37:22.374
Did you kill him?

37:22.408 --> 37:23.709
Did you kill
all the other patients

37:23.742 --> 37:26.011
to cover your tracks?
No.

37:26.044 --> 37:27.546
Your father,
all of them,

37:27.579 --> 37:28.814
they weren't just...

37:28.847 --> 37:30.516
test subjects.

37:30.549 --> 37:32.017
They were my patients.

37:32.050 --> 37:33.852
The NZT wasn't like the other
stuff they'd been taking.

37:33.885 --> 37:36.488
It gave them a chance
to get back on track.

37:36.522 --> 37:38.557
So, you invented NZT
to give addicts

37:38.590 --> 37:39.758
a chance to pull
their lives together?

37:39.791 --> 37:41.960
No, I didn't invent NZT.

37:41.993 --> 37:43.795
My father was

37:43.829 --> 37:45.464
in the early stages
of Alzheimer's

37:45.497 --> 37:46.732
when I got an e-mail.

37:46.765 --> 37:48.800
I have no idea who sent it.

37:48.834 --> 37:50.068
But the message

37:50.101 --> 37:51.437
was a chemical formula

37:51.470 --> 37:53.439
for a nootropic compound.

37:53.472 --> 37:55.441
I had never seen
anything like it.

37:55.474 --> 37:57.376
And I thought it could
help my father.

37:57.409 --> 37:59.745
But I couldn't wait for the FDA.

37:59.778 --> 38:01.447
So, Ubient agreed to it?

38:01.480 --> 38:02.648
They didn't know.

38:02.681 --> 38:03.815
When did they find out?

38:03.849 --> 38:04.816
Ubient didn't know anything

38:04.850 --> 38:06.718
about the study
until several of the patients

38:06.752 --> 38:07.819
had already disappeared.

38:07.853 --> 38:10.055
What happened to all of them?

38:10.088 --> 38:12.023
I don't know.

38:12.057 --> 38:13.359
Your dad

38:13.392 --> 38:14.993
was one of the success stories.

38:15.026 --> 38:16.662
He was doing well.

38:16.695 --> 38:19.531
But I suspected he'd
started sharing his NZT.

38:19.565 --> 38:21.967
It was popping up
all over the city.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.669
I was worried he'd
get himself into trouble.

38:23.702 --> 38:24.903
So I cut him off.

38:24.936 --> 38:26.872
So NZT was all over the city.

38:26.905 --> 38:28.540
Where did it go?

38:28.574 --> 38:30.642
That's the question.

38:30.676 --> 38:32.110
One minute it
was everywhere.

38:32.143 --> 38:34.346
And then it
started to disappear.

38:34.380 --> 38:36.982
And then the people who had it
started to disappear.

38:37.015 --> 38:39.518
People from the trial.

38:39.551 --> 38:41.553
Your dad.

38:43.589 --> 38:46.458
It was like...
some kind of purge.

38:46.492 --> 38:49.528
Someone was
clamping down on NZT.

38:49.561 --> 38:50.696
Who was that?

38:50.729 --> 38:52.664
I don't know.

39:02.674 --> 39:04.610
Hey.

39:04.643 --> 39:05.644
You're okay.

39:05.677 --> 39:07.446
Yeah, sorry about that.

39:07.479 --> 39:09.681
I just wasn't feeling myself.

39:09.715 --> 39:12.618
You didn't answer me
yesterday.

39:12.651 --> 39:14.953
Are you having
side effects from NZT?

39:14.986 --> 39:17.556
You know, I thought I was.

39:17.589 --> 39:19.425
But I feel great today.

39:19.458 --> 39:21.860
And that's not really
how side effects work, right?

39:23.629 --> 39:25.597
So, um, I'm sorry
I worried you.

39:25.631 --> 39:27.599
Worried is an understatement.

39:29.134 --> 39:31.470
I went to see
Andrew Epperly last night.

39:31.503 --> 39:33.038
Yeah, what happened?

39:33.071 --> 39:34.740
He doesn't know of any antidote.

39:34.773 --> 39:36.908
What about your dad?

39:36.942 --> 39:38.577
He did give my dad NZT.

39:38.610 --> 39:39.377
All the patients, actually.

39:39.411 --> 39:42.614
But I don't think
he killed them.

39:42.648 --> 39:43.749
I think
it was somebody else.

39:43.782 --> 39:44.783
(phone chiming)

39:44.816 --> 39:47.919
Someone with resources.

39:47.953 --> 39:50.756
And I think
I'm about to be fired.

39:53.759 --> 39:55.661
You wanted to see me?

39:55.694 --> 39:56.995
Yeah.

39:57.028 --> 39:59.631
Close the door
and sit down, please.

40:08.974 --> 40:11.477
I got a call
from the director's office.

40:11.510 --> 40:14.145
You canceled your meeting.

40:14.179 --> 40:16.047
I'm sorry.

40:16.081 --> 40:17.583
I just--

40:17.616 --> 40:19.751
How long
have you known?

40:19.785 --> 40:22.521
About your father, the file.

40:24.890 --> 40:27.626
You know, I couldn't
put my finger on it at first.

40:27.659 --> 40:30.228
But there was something
about your attitude.

40:30.261 --> 40:31.797
A shift.

40:31.830 --> 40:34.833
And then you blew off
the meeting with the director.

40:34.866 --> 40:38.470
You don't do that, unless you
no longer want a career here.

40:38.504 --> 40:42.040
So I tried to think
of why you would do that.

40:43.208 --> 40:46.745
And there was really
only one good explanation.

40:46.778 --> 40:49.881
NZT is going to change
the entire world, Rebecca.

40:49.915 --> 40:52.784
This division has
to stay in front of it.

40:52.818 --> 40:54.185
And that's why I'm here?

40:54.219 --> 40:56.054
It's not that simple.

40:56.087 --> 40:58.189
I got this job a month
after my father died.

40:58.223 --> 40:59.891
You must've made the connection.

40:59.925 --> 41:01.159
Sure, I did.

41:01.192 --> 41:02.928
I read the file
on Conrad Harris,

41:02.961 --> 41:04.830
and I saw that he had a daughter
that was working Criminal

41:04.863 --> 41:06.698
right here in New York,
so I looked into her

41:06.732 --> 41:08.900
and I saw an agent
who was inexperienced,

41:08.934 --> 41:11.136
but smart,
resourceful, tenacious.

41:11.169 --> 41:13.138
Someone who could help us
with NZT.

41:13.171 --> 41:15.707
Someone
who would want to.

41:15.741 --> 41:19.778
And I planned
on showing you the file.

41:19.811 --> 41:22.748
That's easy to say now.

41:22.781 --> 41:23.782
Okay, you're right.

41:23.815 --> 41:24.449
You don't have to believe me.

41:24.482 --> 41:26.017
That is entirely up to you.

41:26.051 --> 41:28.086
But you need the Bureau's
highest level of clearance

41:28.119 --> 41:30.522
to read the full NZT records.

41:30.556 --> 41:31.657
Legally, that is.

41:31.690 --> 41:34.526
And to get that kind of
clearance, you need to advance.

41:34.560 --> 41:36.695
And to advance,
you need people to notice you.

41:36.728 --> 41:39.030
And that's why I put you
on the red team.

41:40.666 --> 41:42.934
And I covered for you
with the director.

41:42.968 --> 41:45.604
I told him it was
a misunderstanding, my fault.

41:45.637 --> 41:46.872
I bought you 48 hours.
