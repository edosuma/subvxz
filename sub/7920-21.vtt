WEBVTT

00:02.503 --> 00:03.502
ALL: Bye!

00:03.504 --> 00:05.437
Tran.

00:05.439 --> 00:08.674
Great lasagna, it was fantastic.

00:08.676 --> 00:09.675
Now you're fishing.

00:09.677 --> 00:11.777
It was just good,
and you know it.

00:11.779 --> 00:14.613
You used the cheap cheese,
and that was your mistake.

00:14.615 --> 00:15.848
Great noodles, though.

00:15.850 --> 00:17.649
Thank you. Bye.

00:17.651 --> 00:18.650
We care about you.

00:18.652 --> 00:20.052
Mm-hmm.
We did it!

00:20.054 --> 00:21.353
Yes, we did it!
WINSTON: We did it.

00:21.355 --> 00:22.354
Best rehearsal dinner ever.

00:22.356 --> 00:23.622
You guys are a good team.

00:23.624 --> 00:25.024
We haven't slept
all week, but thanks.

00:25.026 --> 00:26.692
I work in hospitality,
it's what I do.

00:26.694 --> 00:27.693
(Jess chuckles)
I've got some cools things

00:27.695 --> 00:29.461
for tomorrow I want to show you.
Right on.

00:29.463 --> 00:31.330
Maid of honor.
(gasps)

00:31.332 --> 00:32.531
Best man.

00:32.533 --> 00:33.899
Mayday J-Day.

00:33.901 --> 00:35.300
What's up, Nick-knack.

00:35.302 --> 00:37.036
We're gonna need some more
hotties on the dance floor.

00:37.038 --> 00:38.170
Copy that.

00:38.172 --> 00:40.039
I'll get those hotties
right over to ya.

00:40.041 --> 00:41.240
(both laugh)

00:41.242 --> 00:42.374
Awesome.

00:42.376 --> 00:43.909
Thank you for letting us
stay in your room.

00:43.911 --> 00:45.210
Of course.

00:45.212 --> 00:46.745
I'm sorry your mother's
not coming, Cece.

00:46.747 --> 00:50.015
Her disapproval of my son
fills me with a hot rage

00:50.017 --> 00:51.917
I've repressed
into a cyst on my back.

00:51.919 --> 00:53.852
It's grotesque.
Sweet dreams, Kid.

00:53.854 --> 00:55.154
Night, Mom.

00:55.156 --> 00:56.088
Good night,
my mom's friend Susan.

00:57.858 --> 00:59.525
Are you guys sure that you don't
want to use the air mattress?

00:59.527 --> 01:00.526
We sleep together.

01:00.528 --> 01:02.027
We've been lovers since 1998.

01:02.029 --> 01:03.762
(laughs)

01:05.066 --> 01:06.698
I want to thank everyone

01:06.700 --> 01:08.000
for an amazing rehearsal dinner.

01:08.002 --> 01:09.568
Special shout out to Winston

01:09.570 --> 01:11.236
for a shockingly good toast.

01:11.238 --> 01:13.005
Winston!
(all applaud)

01:13.007 --> 01:14.706
Insanely good.
Dipping in and out of French.

01:14.708 --> 01:15.607
Powerful stuff, man.

01:15.609 --> 01:16.875
Yay!
No.

01:16.877 --> 01:18.610
Blessings, blessings
on all your households.

01:18.612 --> 01:21.046
All right, I think it's time
to get the bride and the groom

01:21.048 --> 01:22.681
to sleep in separate beds
like boy cousins.

01:22.683 --> 01:24.550
Wait, wait, can we just
say good night first?

01:24.552 --> 01:26.051
(whispers):
We'll allow it.

01:26.053 --> 01:27.252
(normal voice):
We'll allow it.

01:28.222 --> 01:30.322
(moaning softly)

01:31.559 --> 01:32.724
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

01:32.726 --> 01:34.460
I'm gonna do the dishes. Dishes.

01:36.097 --> 01:37.596
Break it up!
What is this?

01:37.598 --> 01:38.764
The last night of drama camp?

01:38.766 --> 01:40.933
Enjoy it while you can
because it gets boring.

01:40.935 --> 01:43.402
Same old lips year after year

01:43.404 --> 01:46.071
with no spark,

01:46.073 --> 01:48.407
just dead tongues touching,

01:48.409 --> 01:50.242
like decayed salmon.

01:50.244 --> 01:51.710
Oh, my God, Winston!

01:51.712 --> 01:52.978
I did it!

01:52.980 --> 01:55.147
♪ ♪

01:56.884 --> 01:58.750
The night before the wedding,

01:58.752 --> 02:02.254
a bride is bound to feel
a little bit emotional,

02:02.256 --> 02:03.722
so nervous?
I got Xanax.

02:03.724 --> 02:05.557
Delicious.
Mm-hmm.

02:05.559 --> 02:08.427
Sad, I have a picture of
a cat riding a dog like a horse.

02:08.429 --> 02:09.761
(both chuckle,
Jess continues chuckling)

02:09.763 --> 02:10.796
Is that for me or for you?

02:10.798 --> 02:12.731
What?
Hmm.

02:12.733 --> 02:14.733
You freak out,
you want to escape to Canada?

02:14.735 --> 02:17.569
I've got our passports and...

02:17.571 --> 02:19.905
Trudeau pics. (whistles)

02:19.907 --> 02:21.740
I'm good, you know?
I don't need anything.

02:21.742 --> 02:23.742
Really?
'Cause you can ask for anything.

02:23.744 --> 02:25.644
After tomorrow,
you're not gonna be able

02:25.646 --> 02:27.479
to use the bride card anymore.

02:27.481 --> 02:28.680
You've got power.

02:28.682 --> 02:29.915
(deep voice):
Wield it.

02:31.085 --> 02:32.818
I'm gonna go crazy
doing this

02:32.820 --> 02:33.819
for you one day.

02:33.821 --> 02:35.420
Well, Sam is the most

02:35.422 --> 02:37.589
objectively marry-able guy
I've ever dated.

02:37.591 --> 02:40.292
He's out there
washing dishes right now.

02:40.294 --> 02:41.426
Mm.

02:41.428 --> 02:42.961
And he's so tall.
So tall.

02:42.963 --> 02:44.763
His jacket on me looks
like a garbage bag.

02:44.765 --> 02:45.831
Check it out.

02:48.602 --> 02:49.935
Oh.

02:49.937 --> 02:51.603
Uh...

02:51.605 --> 02:53.338
(quietly):
What is this?

02:55.442 --> 02:57.276
(gasps)

02:57.278 --> 02:58.677
What? What? What?

03:00.347 --> 03:01.446
(gasps)

03:01.448 --> 03:03.615
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

03:03.617 --> 03:04.917
Is Sam gonna propose?

03:06.320 --> 03:08.453
Oh, my God.

03:09.456 --> 03:11.523
(gasps)
Oh, my God!

03:11.525 --> 03:13.725
Nick, let me tell you something.
It has been a pleasure

03:13.727 --> 03:16.395
watching you blossom
into the best man.

03:16.397 --> 03:18.530
Well, thank you for giving me
the soil to grow.

03:18.532 --> 03:19.865
Good night.

03:22.069 --> 03:23.635
My flash drive is gone!

03:23.637 --> 03:25.370
The flash drive
your vows are on?!

03:25.372 --> 03:27.673
No, a different flash drive!

03:27.675 --> 03:28.674
Then what's the problem?

03:28.676 --> 03:30.209
I was being sarcastic!

03:30.211 --> 03:32.544
Of course the flash drive
that my vows are on!

03:32.546 --> 03:33.679
Ah...

03:33.681 --> 03:35.581
There's my poet's fuel.
Mm!

03:35.583 --> 03:37.649
Mm, I might still be drunk

03:37.651 --> 03:39.818
from my own toast,
but my God,

03:39.820 --> 03:42.888
you are gonna make
a beautiful bride someday.

03:42.890 --> 03:44.823
(inhales deeply)

03:44.825 --> 03:46.491
Bye.

03:48.662 --> 03:50.429
SAM: Uh...

03:50.431 --> 03:51.697
I'm here. I heard it.

03:51.699 --> 03:54.433
Let's acknowledge
that and, uh,

03:54.435 --> 03:56.835
you know where to find me.

03:58.939 --> 04:00.405
It's not here.
I can't find it.

04:00.407 --> 04:01.540
WINSTON: I told
Aly she'd make

04:01.542 --> 04:02.774
a beautiful bride someday,

04:02.776 --> 04:04.409
and then she just bounced.

04:04.411 --> 04:05.777
I mean, why'd I say that?

04:05.779 --> 04:06.878
We've been dating a month.

04:06.880 --> 04:09.581
Dude, Schmidt lost his vows!

04:09.583 --> 04:10.749
For the wedding?!

04:10.751 --> 04:13.051
No, different vows.

04:13.053 --> 04:14.219
Oh, so then
what's the big deal?

04:14.221 --> 04:15.387
What is wrong with you people?!

04:15.389 --> 04:16.755
How'd I lose it?

04:16.757 --> 04:18.223
I wear it around my neck.
I even we--

04:18.225 --> 04:19.391
I even wear it
when I got a spray tan.

04:19.393 --> 04:20.392
WINSTON:
Ooh.

04:20.394 --> 04:21.426
I think I know what happened.

04:21.428 --> 04:22.761
What?

04:22.763 --> 04:25.230
(groans)

04:25.232 --> 04:27.065
Is that a piece of my flash drive?
Yes, it is.

04:27.067 --> 04:28.900
You see, earlier tonight, when
we were practicing the hora...

04:28.902 --> 04:31.203
Winston, stop trying
to throw me off the chair!

04:31.205 --> 04:32.871
That's not the game!

04:32.873 --> 04:34.373
(all cheering)

04:34.375 --> 04:37.209
I don't mean this
anti-Jewish at all,

04:37.211 --> 04:39.911
but that insane Jew dance
has ruined our lives.

04:39.913 --> 04:41.480
I'm freaking out.

04:41.482 --> 04:43.315
It took me nine months
to write those vows.

04:43.317 --> 04:44.416
What do you remember?

04:44.418 --> 04:46.084
Cece...

04:46.086 --> 04:47.586
I can't believe
this day is finally here.

04:47.588 --> 04:48.920
And then...

04:48.922 --> 04:51.590
Rick Santorum
said it best when...

04:51.592 --> 04:52.891
(sighs) I don't--
That's all I got.

04:52.893 --> 04:54.059
That's all I remember.

04:54.061 --> 04:55.227
That's all you remember?!

04:55.229 --> 04:56.762
My vows were like a novel.

04:56.764 --> 04:57.963
How much of your zombie novel
do you remember?

04:57.965 --> 04:58.964
Chapter one--

04:58.966 --> 05:00.766
"On Jack Granger's

05:00.768 --> 05:03.268
41st birthday, he was shot
in the face by his dog Ed."

05:03.270 --> 05:04.970
Understand the situation
that I'm in.

05:04.972 --> 05:07.572
You are so lucky.

05:07.574 --> 05:08.907
How-how am I lucky, Nick?

05:08.909 --> 05:10.609
'Cause one of the
greatest writers

05:10.611 --> 05:12.744
of our time is about
to enter this room.

05:12.746 --> 05:14.146
Would you like to meet him?

05:14.148 --> 05:15.414
All right.

05:15.416 --> 05:17.816
I'll go get him.

05:20.754 --> 05:22.587
There's no way
it's not him, right?

05:22.589 --> 05:24.289
You think it's him?

05:24.291 --> 05:26.692
It's me.

05:29.263 --> 05:31.263
You know what,
just 'cause he has a ring

05:31.265 --> 05:32.764
doesn't mean he's gonna propose
to me tonight or right now.

05:32.766 --> 05:34.433
(knocking)

05:34.435 --> 05:36.101
Hey, guys.
I'm so sorry to interrupt.

05:36.103 --> 05:37.769
Uh, Jess, I have
something important

05:37.771 --> 05:41.340
I want to talk to you about,
when you get a chance.

05:44.812 --> 05:46.445
Okay, yeah.

05:46.447 --> 05:48.280
I'll be right there.

05:48.282 --> 05:50.282
Cool PJ's.

05:50.284 --> 05:53.485
I look like the sky.

05:53.487 --> 05:54.953
(both chuckle softly)

05:54.955 --> 05:56.955
Okay.

05:59.226 --> 06:01.626
(whisper screaming)

06:06.467 --> 06:08.333
This is happening now.
He is going to propose.

06:08.335 --> 06:10.168
I totally didn't
see this coming.

06:10.170 --> 06:11.937
This is great, right?
(brightly): Yeah.

06:14.174 --> 06:15.340
What was that?

06:15.342 --> 06:16.742
What was what?

06:16.744 --> 06:18.377
You paused.

06:18.379 --> 06:19.911
(laughs):
I didn't pause.

06:19.913 --> 06:21.880
You took, like, a huge pause.

06:21.882 --> 06:23.482
You were like...

06:30.224 --> 06:32.324
Longer than that!
Jess--

06:32.326 --> 06:34.493
What<i> aren't</i> you saying?
That's what I'm asking.

06:34.495 --> 06:36.395
Nothing-- if you want
to marry Sam, I want you to!

06:36.397 --> 06:38.330
(gasps) You think
this is a horrible idea!

06:38.332 --> 06:39.765
You know what the truth is?

06:39.767 --> 06:42.601
I think that you paused
on the inside.

06:44.071 --> 06:45.904
Boom.
Don't you boom me.

06:45.906 --> 06:48.673
I boom. First of all, neither
of us should want to say boom.

06:48.675 --> 06:50.041
That's not ever
a cool thing to say.

06:50.043 --> 06:51.610
I'll decide who says boom!

06:51.612 --> 06:53.445
To write anything,
you need to start

06:53.447 --> 06:54.946
with a big idea.

06:54.948 --> 06:56.081
In my last

06:56.083 --> 06:57.749
zombie novel,<i> Uh-oh Guts,</i>

06:57.751 --> 07:00.185
the big idea was that
there were too many guts.

07:00.187 --> 07:01.920
(chuckles)
Schmidt, you're gonna say

07:01.922 --> 07:03.522
the first thing
that comes to mind

07:03.524 --> 07:05.824
when you think of Cece.
Okay.

07:07.861 --> 07:09.928
Cece...

07:09.930 --> 07:12.564
uh, what a...

07:12.566 --> 07:13.899
You're too inside the thing.
I-It's not that hard.

07:13.901 --> 07:14.933
Watch me do it.

07:14.935 --> 07:16.401
Ooh, now we getting somewhere.

07:16.403 --> 07:17.602
Winnie the Bish,

07:17.604 --> 07:18.537
when you feel ready
just say her name.

07:18.539 --> 07:19.538
Her name.

07:19.540 --> 07:20.639
I'm gonna need
you to say, "Cece."

07:20.641 --> 07:22.240
Okay, this is not working. Cece.

07:22.242 --> 07:24.042
Cece... average worker.

07:24.044 --> 07:25.710
Uneducated, but kind.

07:25.712 --> 07:27.479
Wears shoes, boyish...

07:27.481 --> 07:28.747
never really talked to her.

07:28.749 --> 07:29.881
I don't know why
I'm listening to you

07:29.883 --> 07:31.216
in the first place.

07:31.218 --> 07:33.752
You're terrible
at talking to women.

07:33.754 --> 07:35.787
Case in point:
you and Reagan.

07:37.291 --> 07:39.391
Hey, did you clean everywhere?

07:39.393 --> 07:40.926
Are you happy?

07:40.928 --> 07:42.594
Are you happy
that you said that?

07:42.596 --> 07:45.130
I'd like to smell your towel.

07:45.132 --> 07:46.598
Back to the basics, Schmidt.

07:46.600 --> 07:48.900
Okay, there's only
seven types of stories.

07:48.902 --> 07:50.735
Please, don't list them.
NICK: I'm gonna list them.

07:50.737 --> 07:52.938
Man vs. man, man vs. dog,

07:52.940 --> 07:55.474
dog vs. zombie, James Bond,

07:55.476 --> 07:58.076
stories of kings and
lords, women over 50

07:58.078 --> 08:01.813
finding themselves after
divorce, and car commercial.

08:01.815 --> 08:04.249
My favorite is, uh, that Toyota,

08:04.251 --> 08:07.486
uh... ev-every--
the family's in the car...

08:07.488 --> 08:08.820
You're thinking
of the food commercial.

08:08.822 --> 08:10.088
Really? Fat boy talks to idiot.

08:10.090 --> 08:12.090
Okay, eight,
fat boy talks to idiot.

08:12.092 --> 08:13.825
We're getting nowhere. Winston,

08:13.827 --> 08:15.494
I need some of that toast magic.

08:15.496 --> 08:16.495
What do you got?

08:16.497 --> 08:17.796
I'm sorry, but I'm done

08:17.798 --> 08:19.097
speaking from
the heart. I...

08:19.099 --> 08:21.132
basically ruined
my love life today.

08:21.134 --> 08:22.601
Here's my advice to you.
Okay.

08:22.603 --> 08:23.969
Keep your guard up.

08:23.971 --> 08:25.637
Don't be too vulnerable around her.
What?

08:25.639 --> 08:27.772
Be standoff-ish, close yourself.

08:27.774 --> 08:29.274
When she looks at you,
cross your arms.

08:29.276 --> 08:30.775
Turn your back on her.
Whoa, whoa.

08:30.777 --> 08:32.611
For wedding vows,
that's terrible advice.

08:32.613 --> 08:34.779
Yeah... I get it,

08:34.781 --> 08:36.681
but you don't really,
like, know how she feels.

08:38.685 --> 08:40.952
Did I do it?

08:40.954 --> 08:43.021
(laughs)

08:43.023 --> 08:45.056
Did he do it?

08:45.058 --> 08:46.057
(laughs)

08:46.059 --> 08:47.058
(all laughing)

08:47.060 --> 08:48.126
Okay...

08:48.128 --> 08:50.028
all right.
You're welcome.

08:50.030 --> 08:51.830
(laughing)

08:51.832 --> 08:53.765
(all laughing)

08:56.737 --> 08:59.971
That was terrible, Winston!

08:59.973 --> 09:02.173
Slow down, take a breath,

09:02.175 --> 09:05.310
why don't we just talk about it
and figure out what you want?

09:05.312 --> 09:06.811
No, that's what I always do.

09:06.813 --> 09:08.647
I talk and I talk.

09:08.649 --> 09:09.848
Not this time.

09:09.850 --> 09:10.916
I'm gonna, I'm gonna...

09:10.918 --> 09:12.817
push through the panic

09:12.819 --> 09:14.219
and I'm gonna...

09:15.322 --> 09:17.255
say yes.

09:17.257 --> 09:18.857
(gasps)
Really?

09:18.859 --> 09:20.358
I'm gonna go
get proposed to.

09:20.360 --> 09:21.860
Okay, look, well,
if you start freaking out

09:21.862 --> 09:23.161
and you need anything,
just holler, okay?

09:23.163 --> 09:25.530
I will not need
anything from you!

09:25.532 --> 09:28.667
If you get chilly, here's
a blanket that I knitted you.

09:28.669 --> 09:30.068
It took me all year.

09:34.107 --> 09:35.941
(deep breath)

09:35.943 --> 09:37.142
Sam?

09:38.178 --> 09:39.744
You left your jacket in my room.

09:39.746 --> 09:40.812
Oh, thanks.

09:41.949 --> 09:43.682
So, uh, we finally, get a...

09:43.684 --> 09:45.584
moment alone here.

09:45.586 --> 09:47.052
Yes. One moment.

09:47.054 --> 09:48.219
One momentous moment.

09:48.221 --> 09:49.220
I, uh...

09:49.222 --> 09:51.222
know the timing of this is...

09:51.224 --> 09:53.858
been really crazy...

09:53.860 --> 09:55.260
(sighs)

09:55.262 --> 09:56.261
...and, uh...

09:56.263 --> 09:57.762
Jess...

09:57.764 --> 09:59.864
God, I'm so nervous.

09:59.866 --> 10:00.932
Um.

10:02.703 --> 10:04.869
Jess, would you...

10:04.871 --> 10:06.905
True American!
What?

10:06.907 --> 10:08.239
Um, hey, guys,
everybody out here!

10:08.241 --> 10:09.975
We're playing True American!

10:09.977 --> 10:12.210
Cece, I'm hollering!
I'm hollering!

10:12.212 --> 10:13.645
SCHMIDT: <i> We can't play True American.</i>
WINSTON:<i> It's so late already.</i>

10:13.647 --> 10:14.980
No, we can't play...
There's no time.

10:14.982 --> 10:16.047
(whispering):
Help me.

10:17.784 --> 10:20.385
We're gonna play True American

10:20.387 --> 10:21.753
because I want to.

10:21.755 --> 10:24.789
I'm using my bride card!

10:25.926 --> 10:27.025
The bride has spoken.

10:31.598 --> 10:33.598
Tonight we celebrate the brides!
It's True American:

10:33.600 --> 10:34.933
First Ladies Edition!
We can't play True American.

10:34.935 --> 10:36.601
We have to, it's for Cece. Fine.

10:36.603 --> 10:39.070
We play fast, sober,
then back to work.

10:39.072 --> 10:40.772
Who the hell have I become?!
Let's do it.

10:40.774 --> 10:41.773
Okay!

10:41.775 --> 10:43.141
The kitchen is
Michelle's garden,

10:43.143 --> 10:44.609
the bathroom is Mary Todd

10:44.611 --> 10:46.778
Lincoln's Sanitarium,
and as always...

10:46.780 --> 10:48.780
The floor is lava! Let's go!
One, two, three, four!

10:48.782 --> 10:50.649
Jackie O!
ALL: Eleanor!

10:53.620 --> 10:55.587
John cheated, so I'm
redecorating the White House!

10:55.589 --> 10:56.287
Everybody drink!

10:56.289 --> 10:58.123
Even John John?
Yes!

10:58.125 --> 11:00.625
Lava!
All right, all right.

11:00.627 --> 11:02.627
I thought this was
Nancy Reagan's gun closet.

11:02.629 --> 11:03.595
ALL: Lava!

11:03.597 --> 11:04.963
Just someone explain
to me the rules.

11:04.965 --> 11:06.264
Camelot, Bay of Pigs.

11:06.266 --> 11:07.766
You got to redecorate!
Redecorate!

11:07.768 --> 11:08.933
Redecorate!
No, redecorate!

11:08.935 --> 11:09.968
Hey, Jess, can I just

11:09.970 --> 11:11.269
talk to you real quick?

11:11.271 --> 11:14.639
Lesbian road trip. Bye, FDR!
ALL: FDR!

11:14.641 --> 11:16.307
ALL:
Drink, drink, drink, drink!

11:16.309 --> 11:17.308
ALL:
Drink, drink!

11:17.310 --> 11:18.376
Rushmore!

11:21.148 --> 11:22.981
Hillary Headband Hot Potato!

11:22.983 --> 11:25.617
ALL: Congress has
her healthcare bill!

11:25.619 --> 11:27.318
All right, nice and easy.

11:27.320 --> 11:28.853
Oh! Oh! Terrible toss!

11:28.855 --> 11:30.288
ALL: Drink, drink!
Drink, drink!

11:30.290 --> 11:31.189
I know we're guests

11:31.191 --> 11:32.190
in this house,

11:32.192 --> 11:33.358
but it's awfully loud.

11:33.360 --> 11:34.726
Mom!

11:34.728 --> 11:36.995
We're trying
to play a game, God!

11:36.997 --> 11:38.630
Jenna goes to a Yale party!

11:38.632 --> 11:39.998
No, no...
Skull and Bones!

11:40.000 --> 11:41.299
he's had enough, no more.
Skull and Bones!

11:41.301 --> 11:42.634
No more, no more.
ALL: Skull and Bones!

11:42.636 --> 11:44.002
ALL: Drink, drink! Hey... Oh.

11:44.004 --> 11:45.336
Seneca Falls convention!

11:45.338 --> 11:46.371
Women only!

11:46.373 --> 11:47.639
That means you, Cece.

11:47.641 --> 11:48.339
Sorry.

11:48.341 --> 11:49.340
Sam was reaching

11:49.342 --> 11:50.809
for the ring and I freaked out.

11:50.811 --> 11:51.676
How do you know
if you want to spend

11:51.678 --> 11:53.144
the rest of your
life with someone?

11:53.146 --> 11:54.979
You just know.

11:54.981 --> 11:56.715
I don't know.
I can't put it into words.

11:56.717 --> 11:58.683
Try! There are a lot
of words out there,

11:58.685 --> 12:00.885
just pick some of them.

12:00.887 --> 12:04.756
Everything inside
of me just said, "Yes."

12:04.758 --> 12:06.925
I just looked at him.

12:06.927 --> 12:09.094
You know, I just had
this feeling that I was home.

12:09.096 --> 12:11.196
That is very beautiful...

12:11.198 --> 12:14.099
and very, very vague
and not helpful at all.

12:14.101 --> 12:16.367
I do know you can't avoid Sam
all night.

12:16.369 --> 12:18.770
COACH: Guess who's back?
ALL: Coach!

12:18.772 --> 12:20.205
(laughing):
It's me.

12:20.207 --> 12:21.573
Coach!
Yeah.

12:21.575 --> 12:23.041
I thought you
got in tomorrow.

12:23.043 --> 12:24.175
I got on a plane,

12:24.177 --> 12:25.210
dropped May off at the hotel

12:25.212 --> 12:27.212
and now I'm ready to party!

12:27.214 --> 12:29.013
I had six wines on the plane!

12:29.015 --> 12:30.715
I call Coach on my team!
BOTH: Coach on our team!

12:30.717 --> 12:32.183
There's only one way
to solve this.

12:32.185 --> 12:34.519
Go behind the Iron Curtain.

12:34.521 --> 12:35.520
You guys ready?
Yeah.

12:35.522 --> 12:37.255
One, two, three.

12:37.257 --> 12:38.423
SAM:
We got the same number!

12:38.425 --> 12:39.791
That probably means
something, right?

12:40.894 --> 12:42.594
No, no, no, no, no.

12:42.596 --> 12:44.362
ALL:
Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink!

12:44.364 --> 12:45.396
(sighs and whistles)

12:45.398 --> 12:46.431
(clears throat)

12:46.433 --> 12:48.266
I feel like...

12:48.268 --> 12:50.902
like you've been avoiding me.

12:50.904 --> 12:53.471
WINSTON:
Good to have you back, Coach!

12:55.242 --> 12:56.407
What are you doing?

12:56.409 --> 12:58.042
Here I am.

12:58.044 --> 13:00.044
Oh, I'm gonna throw up!
COACH: Where y'all going?

13:00.046 --> 13:01.746
I'm gonna throw up!

13:01.748 --> 13:02.614
Hi.

13:04.251 --> 13:06.084
You gonna barf?
(heaves)

13:06.086 --> 13:07.252
I muffed us!

13:07.254 --> 13:08.453
(sighs)

13:08.455 --> 13:10.388
I muffed us straight
to the moon!

13:10.390 --> 13:11.790
I can never write
my vows right now,

13:11.792 --> 13:13.958
I can barely even
spell my own name.

13:13.960 --> 13:17.428
"S", jeans...

13:17.430 --> 13:18.763
Is that right?

13:18.765 --> 13:20.098
Is "jeans" not a letter?

13:20.100 --> 13:21.099
It feels like a letter to me.

13:21.101 --> 13:22.300
Schmidt, this is...

13:22.302 --> 13:23.301
I-I know it's something,
is it not a letter?

13:23.303 --> 13:25.270
...this is all my fault.

13:25.272 --> 13:27.138
I'm supposed to be
your best man.

13:27.140 --> 13:28.807
I screwed you, Schmidt.

13:28.809 --> 13:31.276
I screwed you!

13:31.278 --> 13:33.311
(sighs) I was just trying
to make Cece happy.

13:33.313 --> 13:34.846
It's all I want.

13:35.949 --> 13:37.415
It's all I ever want to do

13:37.417 --> 13:38.917
is just to make her happy.

13:38.919 --> 13:40.819
Wait a second, say that again.

13:40.821 --> 13:41.986
I screwed you.

13:41.988 --> 13:43.087
Why would you go to that?

13:43.089 --> 13:44.322
No, about making her happy.

13:44.324 --> 13:46.090
All I want to do
is make Cece happy?

13:46.092 --> 13:47.492
(snaps fingers)
There it is.

13:47.494 --> 13:49.928
There's your big idea.

13:49.930 --> 13:51.262
There's my big idea.

13:51.264 --> 13:52.931
Yeah.
To make her happy.

13:52.933 --> 13:53.932
BOTH:
That's it, that's it.

13:53.934 --> 13:55.767
There's my big idea!

13:55.769 --> 13:57.268
All I want to do
is make Cece happy!

13:57.270 --> 13:58.269
There it is!

13:58.271 --> 13:59.771
"Jeans" isn't a letter!

13:59.773 --> 14:01.005
(laughs)
Jeans is pants!

14:01.007 --> 14:02.273
(laughing): Yeah.

14:02.275 --> 14:04.475
Okay, Winnie, you said,
"bride," to a girl

14:04.477 --> 14:05.944
you've been dating for a month?

14:05.946 --> 14:07.846
I think it's sweet.
Shut up, Cece.

14:07.848 --> 14:08.947
Shut up!
You shut up!

14:08.949 --> 14:09.981
I miss you so much.

14:09.983 --> 14:11.049
Oh, my God, I missed you.

14:11.051 --> 14:12.050
Like, for real, missed you.

14:12.052 --> 14:13.351
It's crazy being in New York

14:13.353 --> 14:14.519
'cause I'm like, "Where's Cece?"

14:14.521 --> 14:16.054
Right?!
Like I was saying,

14:16.056 --> 14:17.689
I don't know why I said it,
it just came out,

14:17.691 --> 14:19.958
and I went from the happiest
to the saddest person

14:19.960 --> 14:21.893
I've ever been in 15 seconds.

14:21.895 --> 14:23.895
I just need to be
cooler around her.

14:23.897 --> 14:25.797
Coach, this is where
you come into play.

14:25.799 --> 14:27.131
I need your help, man.

14:27.133 --> 14:28.600
I'm tired of being
a sweetie pie.

14:30.203 --> 14:31.736
No more talking.

14:31.738 --> 14:33.738
WINSTON: This part of
the game, Coach? Heavy.

14:33.740 --> 14:35.974
Why are we out here?
This is nice.

14:35.976 --> 14:36.975
(grunts)
Oh!

14:36.977 --> 14:39.143
Dude.
Hey, man.

14:39.145 --> 14:40.979
How are you gonna ask me to help
you play games with Aly, man?

14:40.981 --> 14:43.081
You don't want that.

14:43.083 --> 14:44.515
Be who you are.

14:44.517 --> 14:46.684
Now, the only way to
find out why she left,

14:46.686 --> 14:49.354
is to go over
there and ask her.

14:49.356 --> 14:50.688
Now.

14:50.690 --> 14:53.324
Yeah, but...
Just do it!

14:53.326 --> 14:55.326
I don't yell in New York
because everyone yells there

14:55.328 --> 14:57.328
and it's less meaningful,
but I will yell here.

14:57.330 --> 14:58.496
Now push the button.

14:59.366 --> 15:00.498
God.

15:00.500 --> 15:02.567
You really don't
yell in New York?

15:02.569 --> 15:04.068
Dude, I'm always
in a museum.

15:04.070 --> 15:06.237
Oh, my goodness. I'm
always in a museum.

15:06.239 --> 15:08.506
So that's basically how
you play True American.

15:08.508 --> 15:10.508
Yeah, it makes no
sense whatsoever. Oh.

15:10.510 --> 15:12.343
Look, I'm just gonna
get this over with.

15:12.345 --> 15:13.945
Um...

15:13.947 --> 15:15.947
Jess, I want to break up...
I can't marry you.

15:15.949 --> 15:17.081
with you.

15:17.083 --> 15:19.384
Oh.

15:19.386 --> 15:21.085
What?

15:21.087 --> 15:24.923
So...

15:24.925 --> 15:26.991
I<i> really</i> can't marry you.

15:31.598 --> 15:33.564
No, I get it.
You're in love with Diane.

15:33.566 --> 15:36.935
She's beautiful, she's your best
friend, you're both doctors.

15:36.937 --> 15:39.938
This morning, I... I went
to drop her off at the airport,

15:39.940 --> 15:42.273
and I just... I just
couldn't let her go,

15:42.275 --> 15:45.243
and it made me
realize that I...

15:45.245 --> 15:47.645
I just... I want to spend
the rest of my life with her,

15:47.647 --> 15:52.050
and, you know, uh, it's hard to
express the feelings in words.

15:52.052 --> 15:53.384
Really?! Really?

15:53.386 --> 15:55.586
Why can no one put
this into words?

15:55.588 --> 15:57.588
I'm-I'm so sorry
about the timing.

15:57.590 --> 15:59.590
I just... I didn't want you
to have to cut my photo

15:59.592 --> 16:02.593
out of all the, you know,
wedding pictures.

16:02.595 --> 16:04.262
And then with
Winston's toast,

16:04.264 --> 16:07.265
with the... all the talk
about honor and integrity and...

16:07.267 --> 16:09.467
the gig economy,
I just...

16:09.469 --> 16:12.470
Can we just wait
to tell people?

16:12.472 --> 16:15.573
I... I don't want to make it
about me before the wedding.

16:15.575 --> 16:17.275
Of course.

16:17.277 --> 16:18.443
Thanks.

16:18.445 --> 16:20.979
Hey, I hope...

16:20.981 --> 16:23.514
I hope Diane really
likes the ring.

16:23.516 --> 16:25.750
What ring?

16:25.752 --> 16:27.819
The ring in your
jacket pocket.

16:27.821 --> 16:31.422
I don't have a ring
in my jacket pocket.

16:31.424 --> 16:33.257
I have a ring in
my jacket pocket.

16:33.259 --> 16:35.159
Yeah.
This isn't mine.

16:37.263 --> 16:39.130
"To Susan. Love Louise."

16:39.132 --> 16:41.799
Oh, my God,
it's engraved?

16:41.801 --> 16:44.669
How did I miss this?

16:44.671 --> 16:47.105
And the font is huge.

16:47.107 --> 16:49.107
So Schmidt's mom and her
girlfriend are getting married.

16:49.109 --> 16:51.109
♪ ♪

16:51.111 --> 16:52.944
They're what?

16:52.946 --> 16:54.112
Ma?

16:54.114 --> 16:55.446
Ma?!

16:55.448 --> 16:58.149
Are you proposing
to your friend Susan?

16:58.151 --> 16:59.384
Ma?!

17:02.789 --> 17:05.990
Oh, Winston, now's really
not a good time.

17:05.992 --> 17:08.993
I know saying the word "bride"
to you was a little crazy,

17:08.995 --> 17:10.661
but let me just
explain myself, okay?

17:10.663 --> 17:12.730
What I meant to say
is that you're beautiful.

17:12.732 --> 17:15.299
Every day with you
is so much better.

17:15.301 --> 17:16.801
Your brain is banging.

17:16.803 --> 17:18.569
The skin-bag it comes in
ain't too bad either.

17:18.571 --> 17:20.571
(groans)
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

17:20.573 --> 17:23.207
You know what,
except that I'm not sorry, okay?

17:23.209 --> 17:24.542
Because this is who I am.

17:24.544 --> 17:27.478
No, Winston,
I have food poisoning.

17:28.381 --> 17:29.847
Yeah, I don't know who let

17:29.849 --> 17:32.417
Nick's mute park friend
cook dinner for 20,

17:32.419 --> 17:36.320
but I want to find
and throw up on them.

17:36.322 --> 17:38.189
That's why you left.

17:38.191 --> 17:39.590
Why didn't you just tell me?

17:39.592 --> 17:43.761
Because I don't like
being vulnerable.

17:43.763 --> 17:45.830
It was stupid of me.
I'm sorry.

17:45.832 --> 17:47.598
I...

17:50.570 --> 17:52.570
I...

17:52.572 --> 17:55.973
I love you, you maniac.

17:57.744 --> 18:01.446
You love... you love me?

18:01.448 --> 18:02.447
I love you.

18:02.449 --> 18:04.282
I love you, too.

18:05.919 --> 18:08.586
Wow, that feels so good to say.

18:08.588 --> 18:10.021
I love you.
I love you.

18:10.023 --> 18:12.023
I love<i> you. </i>
I love you.

18:12.025 --> 18:13.224
I... love... you.

18:13.226 --> 18:15.560
(groans)
How is there anything left?

18:15.562 --> 18:18.696
(groaning)

18:18.698 --> 18:20.731
You okay?
(retching)

18:20.733 --> 18:23.234
JESS: So sorry for
ruining your engagement.

18:23.236 --> 18:25.536
I'm sure you didn't plan a joint
celebration with a man wearing

18:25.538 --> 18:26.571
a beer can crown

18:26.573 --> 18:29.073
and pillows on his shoes.

18:29.075 --> 18:30.541
Jealous
'cause I'm the True American.

18:30.543 --> 18:32.243
We're sorry we left
the ring in your room.

18:32.245 --> 18:34.312
That's what we get
for fooling around in your bed.

18:34.314 --> 18:36.581
SUSAN: Something about
those high ceilings.

18:36.583 --> 18:38.583
We just like tossing
each other around.

18:38.585 --> 18:40.284
JESS: Hello! Hey, quick
show of hands, God.

18:40.286 --> 18:41.853
who's had sex
in Jess's room?

18:43.423 --> 18:45.490
Well, I've had sex in your room.
I know.

18:46.926 --> 18:47.658
What?!

18:48.895 --> 18:50.761
Everyone's had sex in my room?

18:50.763 --> 18:52.230
I got weird in there.

18:52.232 --> 18:53.431
I've gotten weirder
in there than you have.

18:53.433 --> 18:54.265
Really?

18:54.267 --> 18:55.600
Those pillows.

18:55.602 --> 18:56.767
There's just,

18:56.769 --> 18:59.237
like, extra, like...

18:59.239 --> 19:01.272
pressure.

19:01.274 --> 19:02.640
SCHMIDT: If you don't mind,
I'd like to say

19:02.642 --> 19:05.743
a few words about
my mom and my mom's...

19:05.745 --> 19:07.145
My mom's friend Susan.
My mom's friend Susan.

19:07.147 --> 19:08.779
God, you guys,
let me talk.

19:08.781 --> 19:12.316
Look, Susan, I know I
never fully accepted you.

19:12.318 --> 19:14.652
I just... I didn't know how
long you were gonna be around.

19:14.654 --> 19:16.320
And, also, you used
to call my mom

19:16.322 --> 19:18.322
the Big Ragoo and me
the Little Ragoo,

19:18.324 --> 19:20.458
and I couldn't make
any sense of it.

19:20.460 --> 19:23.494
But... you're a part
of our family now.

19:25.598 --> 19:28.599
To my mom... and my mom.

19:28.601 --> 19:29.634
Yeah! Cheers! Cheers.

19:29.636 --> 19:31.769
Cheers. Yeah, cheers.
Cheers.

19:31.771 --> 19:33.271
Opa.
Yeah!

19:33.273 --> 19:35.173
Aw. Mwah.

19:38.344 --> 19:40.778
Mmm.

19:40.780 --> 19:43.214
Cece?

19:45.218 --> 19:46.884
(sighs)

19:46.886 --> 19:49.353
Babe, what's wrong?

19:49.355 --> 19:52.356
It's just that you're gonna have
two moms at the wedding,

19:52.358 --> 19:54.358
and I'm not even gonna have one.

19:54.360 --> 19:57.862
I really thought that...
I really thought that

19:57.864 --> 19:59.397
she would just show up
last-minute

19:59.399 --> 20:02.333
'cause she would know
how happy it would make me.

20:02.335 --> 20:05.036
(sniffles) I don't know
why I'm crying in here.

20:05.038 --> 20:07.738
Jess's room is meant for sex.

20:07.740 --> 20:10.308
I know. I know.
(sniffles)

20:17.717 --> 20:19.984
So,

20:19.986 --> 20:23.354
just-just hit "Lobby" and
let technology do its thing.

20:23.356 --> 20:27.191
Yeah, cool. When-when I get in
there, I'll just hit "Lobby."

20:27.193 --> 20:29.260
Cool.

20:32.532 --> 20:34.865
Just out of
curiosity, Jess,

20:34.867 --> 20:37.501
why couldn't you marry me?

20:37.503 --> 20:39.737
Oh, I don't know.

20:39.739 --> 20:42.139
(doors open)

20:43.109 --> 20:45.109
Come on, Jess. You know.

20:45.111 --> 20:46.410
No, I don't.

20:46.412 --> 20:48.246
Yes, you do. I mean, I know.

20:48.248 --> 20:50.414
You do? Then what is it?

20:50.416 --> 20:51.882
You know.

20:51.884 --> 20:53.351
No, I-I don't know.

20:53.353 --> 20:54.919
What-what is it?

20:54.921 --> 20:58.022
It's Nick.
