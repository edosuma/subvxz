00:19.645 --> 00:22.239
To our fathers
and their children...

00:22.381 --> 00:25.908
Once upon a time,
there was a country...

00:26.052 --> 00:29.044
and its capital was Belgrade.

00:29.188 --> 00:31.315
April 6, 1941...

01:04.290 --> 01:06.622
I'll kill them, my friend!

01:13.799 --> 01:15.061
Careful, my friend!

01:19.238 --> 01:21.468
I'll kill them!

01:37.790 --> 01:40.190
Don't, it's dangerous!

01:48.768 --> 01:52.499
Ivan, my brother!

01:52.638 --> 01:54.697
The Vice-President spoke
of increased cooperation

01:54.840 --> 01:57.638
between the two nations
of Yugoslavia.

02:08.920 --> 02:12.413
That's my brother...

02:12.558 --> 02:14.753
and his best friend, Blacky!

02:14.894 --> 02:17.795
Hooligans! Hooligans!

02:17.930 --> 02:24.836
What can I do?
They're all I... have.

02:33.779 --> 02:35.770
Marko!

02:35.915 --> 02:40.716
Come in for a cup of coffee.

02:40.853 --> 02:44.516
Impossible, man, I'm in a hurry!
My friend's tired!

02:44.657 --> 02:46.420
I'm tired...

02:46.559 --> 02:49.858
I'll buy you lunch tomorrow
at "The Russian Tsar"!

03:16.322 --> 03:18.586
Get off that horse
and get in the house!

03:18.724 --> 03:21.420
Vera, I'm a free man, you hear?

03:21.560 --> 03:23.323
A free man?
You're kidding!

03:23.462 --> 03:25.293
Damn it!

03:25.431 --> 03:27.831
Vera, I have something important
to tell you.

03:27.967 --> 03:28.934
Listen...

03:29.068 --> 03:30.296
What?

03:30.436 --> 03:32.233
Don't be angry...

03:32.371 --> 03:34.771
We enrolled Petar
in the Communist Party.

03:34.907 --> 03:36.670
A whore-house rather!

03:36.809 --> 03:38.401
He's one of us now.

03:38.544 --> 03:39.533
Get inside!

03:39.678 --> 03:42.203
Okay, just one last word
to my friend.

03:42.348 --> 03:45.613
Get inside.
I have to sort things out with him.

03:46.585 --> 03:48.450
See who I have to live with!

03:48.587 --> 03:50.111
I love you.
Let me kiss you.

03:50.256 --> 03:51.382
Not on the lips, fucker!

03:51.524 --> 03:54.425
Blacky!
Get in the house!

03:54.560 --> 03:56.357
She's like this every morning!

03:56.495 --> 04:01.364
I'll leave you,
just like Marko's wife left him.

04:01.500 --> 04:02.694
I'm a free man...

04:35.367 --> 04:38.165
Eenie, meenie, minie, mo...

04:56.388 --> 04:59.118
Part One - The War

05:50.442 --> 05:54.378
In the attic,
a small apartment...

05:55.848 --> 05:57.247
On the wall...

05:58.584 --> 06:00.074
Looloo... Breakfast!

06:03.956 --> 06:08.359
A small clock on the wall...

06:08.494 --> 06:12.863
Is ticking... tick-tock...

06:13.732 --> 06:16.599
In the attic... an apartment...

06:16.735 --> 06:21.001
Does your mother obey you?

08:22.861 --> 08:24.158
Soni!

09:52.518 --> 09:59.356
That's it! Do it! Go on!

09:59.491 --> 10:01.891
- Let go!
- The best is yet to come!

10:06.665 --> 10:08.360
Wait!

10:43.268 --> 10:45.998
Fucking fascist motherfuckers!

10:47.873 --> 10:49.306
How can you keep eating?

10:50.943 --> 10:52.205
I can and that's that.

10:57.516 --> 10:59.746
How can you,
with all these bombs?

11:00.285 --> 11:01.445
Out of spite!

11:02.854 --> 11:04.549
You want me to die hungry?

11:14.099 --> 11:15.896
My shoes!

11:17.069 --> 11:18.696
Not my shoes!

11:24.343 --> 11:25.310
You fat horse!

11:41.193 --> 11:42.353
I've had enough.

11:51.903 --> 11:52.927
That does it!

11:54.873 --> 11:57.239
They're bombing my city!

12:02.948 --> 12:04.506
Raiding my city!

12:05.250 --> 12:06.615
My own city!

12:06.752 --> 12:09.118
Where are you going, Blacky?

12:09.254 --> 12:14.157
To "greet" the fucking criminals
who've come to destroy my city!

12:14.293 --> 12:16.022
- I know where you're going!
- You do?

12:16.161 --> 12:17.185
I know!

12:18.096 --> 12:19.996
To see that whore!

12:20.132 --> 12:22.999
What whore?
You're crazy, you really are.

12:23.135 --> 12:24.159
That actress.

12:24.303 --> 12:26.168
What?
I'm defending my country!

12:26.305 --> 12:27.932
- Don't lie!
- Vera!

12:28.073 --> 12:29.097
You're defending that whore!

12:29.241 --> 12:32.369
God, it's impossible to have
a serious talk with you!

12:37.983 --> 12:39.245
What are you saying?

12:39.384 --> 12:41.944
You get on my nerves!

12:42.087 --> 12:43.349
Here it is!

12:43.488 --> 12:47.254
I'm saying what the whole town
is saying.

12:48.493 --> 12:49.619
What is it, my love?

12:50.429 --> 12:53.057
You never leave that theatre!

12:53.198 --> 12:55.860
You're in that theatre every night.

12:56.001 --> 12:58.128
I know, I love the theatre.

12:58.270 --> 12:59.828
You love the theatre?

13:00.205 --> 13:02.173
You love the theatre!

13:02.307 --> 13:04.502
So? What's so strange about that?

13:04.643 --> 13:08.409
You love that whore, not the theatre!

13:08.547 --> 13:10.344
If you weren't pregnant...

13:10.482 --> 13:12.814
You'd what?
You lying creep!

13:12.951 --> 13:14.418
- Me?
- Yes, you!

13:14.553 --> 13:16.578
You, you scum!

13:18.223 --> 13:20.350
What is it? What?

13:24.229 --> 13:25.526
Shame on you, Vera!

13:28.133 --> 13:29.100
Blacky!

13:32.838 --> 13:34.533
What's happening?

13:41.947 --> 13:48.785
Don't cry!
I'll build you a new zoo.

13:48.920 --> 13:49.887
Come on...

13:50.021 --> 13:51.852
Look...

13:58.263 --> 13:59.457
Get lost!

14:00.232 --> 14:02.200
The survivors will be eaten,
can't you see?

14:02.834 --> 14:03.801
Here's some money.

14:05.270 --> 14:06.999
Buy some milk for the baby monkey.

14:07.139 --> 14:10.597
Come on, stop crying.
The Germans will make fun of you.

15:18.009 --> 15:22.275
National Theatre
Clearance Team

15:36.728 --> 15:38.195
Working hard, artists?

15:38.330 --> 15:39.319
You bet!

15:42.968 --> 15:44.663
Bato, sweets!

15:44.803 --> 15:46.065
Uncle Blacky!

15:51.076 --> 15:53.203
Are you avoiding me?
Let's not play games.

15:53.345 --> 15:54.778
You're dead right!

15:54.913 --> 15:55.902
What do you mean?

15:56.047 --> 15:58.379
You know very well
what I mean!

15:58.517 --> 15:59.484
No, I don't.

15:59.618 --> 16:00.585
I don't!

16:00.719 --> 16:03.483
You want me and Bato
in a prison camp?

16:03.622 --> 16:04.611
What?

16:04.756 --> 16:07.224
The whole city is talking about it.
You thief!

16:07.359 --> 16:08.326
Me?

16:08.460 --> 16:09.427
What's the town saying?

16:09.561 --> 16:11.222
Don't try to act stupid.

16:11.363 --> 16:14.855
You steal people's gold and money.
You steal!

16:15.000 --> 16:16.661
I only steal from the rich...

16:16.801 --> 16:18.962
what they stole from the poor!

16:19.104 --> 16:20.537
- Stop it...
- You stop it!

16:20.672 --> 16:21.832
Working hard?

16:25.010 --> 16:26.238
Do you love me?

16:28.213 --> 16:29.339
Well, yes.

16:29.481 --> 16:30.448
Come on, give me a kiss!

16:37.289 --> 16:39.587
You love me!
I've been looking for you for days.

16:39.724 --> 16:40.691
I'm scared.

16:40.825 --> 16:42.452
You get on my nerves!

16:42.594 --> 16:44.824
You get on mine!
Have you seen this?

16:46.932 --> 16:48.092
You're a wanted man.

16:50.268 --> 16:51.462
Ten thousand!

16:51.603 --> 16:53.400
Ten thousand for my life!
Rubbish!

16:55.040 --> 16:56.064
Franz!

17:01.479 --> 17:02.537
Franz?

17:08.019 --> 17:09.714
Fré‹Ÿlein Zovko...

17:09.854 --> 17:11.219
Oh, Franz!
Good morning.

17:13.391 --> 17:14.824
I've been waiting.

17:16.328 --> 17:18.819
We have a table waiting
at "The Russian Tsar".

17:18.964 --> 17:20.727
Yes... and my brother?

17:20.865 --> 17:25.393
Seisenberger, do me a favour.
Take this "vehicle" and follow us.

17:25.537 --> 17:26.526
But carefully!

17:36.481 --> 17:38.108
Franz...

17:38.516 --> 17:40.541
Ivan, open up!

17:43.154 --> 17:46.180
Stay there by the door
and don't move!

17:46.324 --> 17:49.623
Ivan!
My God, it stinks in here!

17:49.761 --> 17:51.626
Vera, take a seat!

17:53.431 --> 17:57.595
My brother's like Noah
saving the world after the flood.

17:57.736 --> 17:59.761
Don't move and keep quiet!

18:20.992 --> 18:24.325
What are you doing?

18:24.462 --> 18:25.952
Shame on you!

18:27.165 --> 18:29.929
Always hanging yourself!

18:30.068 --> 18:32.036
My God...

18:48.286 --> 18:51.915
I've had enough of this life...

18:52.057 --> 18:54.048
Enough? Instead of helping me
and being a hero,

18:54.192 --> 18:58.891
you hang yourself like a sissy!
Shame on you!

18:59.030 --> 19:00.520
An announcement from the Gestapo

19:00.665 --> 19:04.192
to citizens of Belgrade
and other towns.

19:04.335 --> 19:09.329
Bandits robbed a train
full of arms and munitions last night.

19:09.474 --> 19:11.965
The attack was the work
of the Communist criminals,

19:12.110 --> 19:16.945
Petar Popara, known as Blacky,
and Marko Dren.

19:17.082 --> 19:19.812
What have you done?

19:19.951 --> 19:23.887
Nothing. Last night,
we roughed up a few thieves.

19:24.022 --> 19:26.582
Marko, oh Lord...

19:30.128 --> 19:32.062
Someone ratted on us.

19:33.164 --> 19:35.689
Some bastard squealer
gave our names!

19:36.334 --> 19:37.858
Our comrades were arrested.

19:38.002 --> 19:41.802
Was Blacky arrested?
Taken in?

19:41.940 --> 19:44.204
Arrested, my ass,
just as they'll never catch me.

19:44.609 --> 19:45.701
Come on, hurry up!

19:47.278 --> 19:49.803
Why do I have to come?

19:49.948 --> 19:51.939
Because you're my brother.

19:55.253 --> 19:57.016
Let him go!

20:15.140 --> 20:17.165
Come on, people!

20:27.786 --> 20:30.016
No, it's nothing!
I can manage!

20:41.933 --> 20:43.230
Who is it?

20:43.368 --> 20:44.335
It's me, grandad!

20:44.469 --> 20:45.902
Who is it?

20:46.037 --> 20:47.561
It's me! Marko!

20:48.072 --> 20:49.403
Who?

20:49.541 --> 20:50.940
Marko, for God's sake!

20:52.310 --> 20:53.277
Who?

20:54.145 --> 20:55.373
It's me, Marko! Open up!

20:55.513 --> 20:56.480
It's you, Marko!

20:56.614 --> 20:57.581
Yes, it's me.

20:58.049 --> 21:03.544
Come on in!
The Germans could be here any minute!

21:03.688 --> 21:07.124
Go downstairs,
I'll take care of your stuff later.

21:07.258 --> 21:09.453
The cellar's behind the stove.

21:14.299 --> 21:15.789
Let them through!
Come on!

21:19.137 --> 21:21.128
Where are you taking
those animals?

21:21.272 --> 21:23.797
It's not a zoo down there,
it's a shelter for humans!

21:29.080 --> 21:30.069
I'm closing!

21:47.498 --> 21:48.829
This is horrible!

21:50.301 --> 21:51.393
Horrible!

22:26.504 --> 22:29.473
Where are you now, Blacky,
you bastard?

22:40.251 --> 22:42.310
Has it st... st...

22:42.453 --> 22:44.318
Yes, it's started, it's started!

22:44.455 --> 22:47.982
It's started!
Grandad!

22:49.127 --> 22:50.719
Marko!

22:57.168 --> 22:58.465
Blacky's wife

22:58.603 --> 23:01.265
...is giving birth!
- Out of the way!

23:01.406 --> 23:04.671
Please, quickly!

23:04.809 --> 23:09.678
Bring some water,
a sheet, any white piece of cloth...

23:09.814 --> 23:12.510
Quickly! It's coming!

23:12.650 --> 23:14.208
Don't worry.

23:17.088 --> 23:20.751
Is everything all right?

23:20.892 --> 23:22.985
It will be, but I need more light.

23:29.200 --> 23:34.069
Right, lift up the bicycle!
Come on, higher!

24:10.041 --> 24:11.065
Ivan!

24:17.248 --> 24:18.715
I don't feel well.

24:19.650 --> 24:23.108
Everything will be fine.

24:23.254 --> 24:28.521
No, it won't. It won't.

24:32.130 --> 24:34.098
If anything happens to me...

24:38.903 --> 24:40.131
call him Jovan.

24:47.912 --> 24:49.675
Vera!

24:55.753 --> 24:57.846
3 years later,
Belgrade was suffering

24:57.922 --> 25:01.187
an open fracture of its soul...

25:13.004 --> 25:18.670
Stop, stop,
swift waters of the Ibar

25:23.581 --> 25:31.386
Why are you in such a hurry

25:39.864 --> 25:40.888
All together!

25:41.032 --> 25:46.595
I have my sorrows too

25:52.376 --> 25:58.804
Deeper than you may know

25:59.917 --> 26:03.614
The drinks are on me.
It's my son's birthday!

26:06.324 --> 26:08.292
Here's my Jovan!
Look at him!

26:09.460 --> 26:11.451
Handsome lad, Blacky!
Congratulations!

26:11.596 --> 26:13.291
He will be, Mustafa!

26:13.431 --> 26:17.231
I'll send him to school in Moscow
to be an officer,

26:17.368 --> 26:20.394
not a thief like you.
You motherfucking crook!

26:22.874 --> 26:24.466
We're partners.

26:24.609 --> 26:25.667
But for how long?

26:28.446 --> 26:29.413
What's up?

26:29.547 --> 26:32.107
Are you thieves getting jumpy?

26:32.250 --> 26:33.217
My friend!

26:33.651 --> 26:37.815
Happy birthday to your Jovan,
my friend!

26:39.223 --> 26:40.918
My good old friend!

26:41.125 --> 26:43.958
Look at him.
He's my spitting image!

26:44.095 --> 26:45.892
With a hint of Vera.

26:46.030 --> 26:47.827
You think so?

26:47.965 --> 26:48.989
What kept you?

26:49.133 --> 26:51.761
There's a traitor among us.
We've got problems.

26:51.903 --> 26:52.995
Those three are here.

26:53.137 --> 26:54.263
I saw them. Hang around.

26:56.741 --> 26:58.732
Sorry to keep you waiting.

26:59.944 --> 27:05.507
Good evening!

27:05.650 --> 27:07.914
If you please, gentlemen...

27:08.052 --> 27:09.917
I'm doing this for your own good.

27:13.357 --> 27:14.585
Gentlemen, please...

27:28.940 --> 27:30.601
Franz!

27:33.010 --> 27:34.944
Flowers for Natalija!

27:36.280 --> 27:38.009
He kills us and fucks her!

27:39.584 --> 27:40.846
Excuse me.

27:43.487 --> 27:45.455
Get me the biggest bouquet
you can find.

27:45.590 --> 27:46.579
Sure.

27:48.492 --> 27:50.926
- What about the priest?
- All arranged.

27:51.062 --> 27:52.120
Perfect...

27:53.397 --> 27:55.524
My friend,
there'll be a wedding!

27:57.435 --> 27:59.562
Now let's play fair.

27:59.704 --> 28:04.334
Here's my gun, give me yours.
That's fair.

28:05.710 --> 28:09.544
This is gold. See it?
This is gold, right?

28:09.680 --> 28:13.707
How much did the gold bring in?
Look at it!

28:13.851 --> 28:16.752
How much did it bring in?

28:16.887 --> 28:18.218
Look at it!

28:18.356 --> 28:20.620
How much for the gold?

28:21.259 --> 28:22.817
200,000!

28:22.960 --> 28:26.191
200,000?
Mustafa, you said 120,000.

28:26.330 --> 28:27.729
Never mind.

28:27.865 --> 28:32.199
Now tell me where the weapons are
and we're done.

28:32.336 --> 28:35.772
I swear on my mother's grave,
the Germans took them.

28:35.906 --> 28:37.373
Leave your mother out of this!

28:44.782 --> 28:46.010
Motherfucker!

28:47.318 --> 28:51.277
You steal my money?
I rob banks, jewellery stores,

28:51.422 --> 28:53.287
and you fuckers steal my money!

28:58.763 --> 29:00.993
You dirty fucking thieves!

29:01.132 --> 29:03.066
I'll kill you all, you bastards!

29:03.200 --> 29:08.035
I'll clean Belgrade
of scum like you!

29:08.172 --> 29:12.506
Our comrades are shot in the woods,
they eat roots and you steal...

29:12.643 --> 29:14.838
You've gone crazy!

29:19.517 --> 29:22.714
No, guys,
we don't play this way...

29:22.853 --> 29:25.014
Hold these, honey, please.

29:31.095 --> 29:32.756
Faster and louder!

29:39.136 --> 29:42.128
Here I come, my friend!
Hang on!

30:02.760 --> 30:03.852
Watch out!

30:11.268 --> 30:12.895
Here I come!

30:25.683 --> 30:27.241
Not in my ear!

30:31.689 --> 30:35.090
Left! Left! Left!

30:44.034 --> 30:47.231
I have to tell you something,
you being the Party Secretary...

30:48.672 --> 30:51.266
If anything,
it'll be these thieves and criminals

30:51.409 --> 30:52.899
who'll cost us our heads.

30:53.377 --> 30:57.143
Right. We rob stores to buy
arms and food for our comrades.

30:57.281 --> 30:59.749
And the bastards steal from us!

31:00.985 --> 31:04.045
"I'll kill myself.

31:04.121 --> 31:06.612
"You say you'll kill yourself.

31:06.757 --> 31:09.021
"But you won't do it.

31:09.160 --> 31:11.594
"Are you so sure?

31:11.729 --> 31:14.095
"Do you think a man can live..."

31:14.231 --> 31:16.131
Quiet!

31:16.267 --> 31:20.169
"...if he has nothing
and nobody to live for?

31:20.304 --> 31:23.068
"Are you capitulating?

31:23.207 --> 31:25.937
"No, I suggest

31:26.076 --> 31:29.170
"that we make peace."

31:29.313 --> 31:30.780
He's entranced by her!

31:33.217 --> 31:37.381
I'll kill him, I swear!
The other actors don't interest him!

31:37.521 --> 31:40.581
I think the Captain's excellent.

31:40.724 --> 31:41.713
- Really?
- Yes, look at him!

31:41.859 --> 31:43.656
Quiet!

32:05.916 --> 32:08.646
Hands off.
This is a theatre, watch the show!

32:11.989 --> 32:13.581
Good evening.

32:15.359 --> 32:16.917
"Promise to tell me

32:17.061 --> 32:23.489
"the truth
and I'll forgive you in advance.

32:23.634 --> 32:26.330
"Is Berta my child?

32:26.470 --> 32:30.304
"I cannot assume the guilt

32:30.441 --> 32:34.275
"for a deed I didn't commit."

32:40.718 --> 32:42.549
Get out!

32:46.991 --> 32:48.515
Have you no shame?

32:48.659 --> 32:54.427
"Is Berta my child?"

32:54.565 --> 32:56.624
"Is Berta my child?"

32:56.767 --> 32:59.827
"Is Berta my child?"

32:59.970 --> 33:01.028
I'm coming.

33:03.340 --> 33:04.602
Bato!

33:04.742 --> 33:05.766
Quiet!

33:05.910 --> 33:06.877
Uncle Blacky!

33:07.011 --> 33:08.308
Natalija is the best!

33:08.445 --> 33:09.742
She is the best!

33:13.951 --> 33:15.714
Franz!

33:22.893 --> 33:24.793
- This is a scandal.
- I know...

33:49.153 --> 33:51.314
Captain!

33:51.455 --> 33:54.288
Good evening, madam.

33:54.425 --> 33:55.392
Captain...

33:55.960 --> 33:57.655
Just a moment.

33:57.928 --> 33:59.520
I am...

33:59.964 --> 34:01.898
Berta's father.

34:02.032 --> 34:07.060
I am the father of your child.

34:07.771 --> 34:08.760
Please...

34:11.875 --> 34:12.864
Do you understand?

34:24.288 --> 34:27.416
Tie us together. Quickly!

34:29.860 --> 34:32.090
I now have my Laura with me.

34:32.663 --> 34:34.152
We're in love.

34:34.297 --> 34:35.389
Hurry!

34:35.532 --> 34:39.127
We're leaving your house
so we can live together.

34:40.170 --> 34:41.467
Please don't be angry.

34:42.672 --> 34:43.969
- Finished?
- Yes.

34:44.108 --> 34:46.132
Thank you, captain.

34:46.275 --> 34:48.244
I know this actor.

34:48.379 --> 34:52.315
I know him...
Where on earth from?

34:52.449 --> 34:54.007
Good-bye, captain.

34:56.754 --> 34:59.552
You act for Germans,
you motherfucker!

35:07.498 --> 35:09.090
Wonderful actor, my colleague!

35:24.748 --> 35:26.045
Are these the mains?

35:45.669 --> 35:47.864
Keep to your seats!

35:55.045 --> 35:56.842
Hands up, traitor!

35:57.614 --> 35:59.343
Hands up!

35:59.483 --> 36:01.246
Is this the curtain?

36:01.385 --> 36:03.979
It is but please, sir...

36:11.261 --> 36:13.786
Uncle Blacky! Sis!

36:15.099 --> 36:17.932
Uncle Blacky!
Charge!

36:24.374 --> 36:26.103
You want my sister?

36:26.243 --> 36:30.680
Well, you won't have her.
You won't!

36:35.853 --> 36:37.946
Come on!
Hands up, my friend!

36:39.890 --> 36:42.154
They'll kill my brother!

37:09.686 --> 37:12.746
Blow on that horn!
I don't get married every night!

37:13.590 --> 37:14.716
Congratulations!

37:14.858 --> 37:17.258
Okay, Golub. Where's the priest?

37:17.394 --> 37:18.918
I sent a boy to fetch him.

37:19.062 --> 37:20.427
Congratulations, miss.

37:20.564 --> 37:21.963
I'm not getting married!

37:22.099 --> 37:24.795
Yes, you are.
You just don't know it yet.

37:26.603 --> 37:30.471
So, I ruined your life by killing Franz.
Thank you, Natalija!

37:30.607 --> 37:32.666
Who gets Bato's medicine,
you or Franz?

37:33.977 --> 37:36.912
- You only bring me stolen gold!
- From traitors.

37:38.115 --> 37:39.605
Come to your senses.

37:39.750 --> 37:40.978
Listen to me...

37:41.118 --> 37:43.313
I've never loved anyone so much.

37:43.453 --> 37:46.513
But respect some rules.
No collaborating with the enemy!

37:46.657 --> 37:47.646
Right!

37:47.791 --> 37:50.487
What do you mean?
I'm just an actress.

37:51.929 --> 37:54.454
The bakeries are working!

37:54.598 --> 37:56.657
Yes, but you're not a baker.

37:56.800 --> 37:58.495
You don't sell pies.

37:58.635 --> 38:00.034
You sell your soul.

38:00.170 --> 38:03.765
I personally will judge those
who sell their soul.

38:03.907 --> 38:07.570
First, I'll kill the manager
of your theatre.

38:08.078 --> 38:11.309
I'll strangle him with my bare hands...
because I love the theatre!

38:32.135 --> 38:34.194
Congratulations, Mr. Blacky!

38:47.584 --> 38:51.714
Will this dinner eat us
before we eat it?

38:52.656 --> 38:54.783
Get that fish grilled properly.

38:54.925 --> 38:56.916
No problem!

38:58.962 --> 39:02.363
Have you no shame?
Others help wounded partisans

39:02.499 --> 39:05.024
while you perform
for the bastards!

39:08.305 --> 39:09.670
It hurts!

39:09.806 --> 39:11.398
So now it hurts you!

39:12.876 --> 39:13.968
I love you.

39:16.980 --> 39:18.277
Golub!

39:19.950 --> 39:21.247
Grill it!

39:21.752 --> 39:23.686
Follow me, I'm going for a pee.

39:24.988 --> 39:26.819
Watch my bride, my friend.

39:27.925 --> 39:29.483
Let's go!

39:44.775 --> 39:45.969
Marko!

39:57.287 --> 39:58.777
Come on! Follow me!

40:08.365 --> 40:09.764
I don't want to!

40:25.048 --> 40:27.016
I don't want to get married!

40:28.418 --> 40:31.387
Golub, I won't leave the partisans
to sort you all out.

40:31.521 --> 40:32.818
There's no need.

40:32.956 --> 40:35.220
You may not know this

40:35.359 --> 40:39.921
but he's not
an electrical engineer at all.

40:41.732 --> 40:45.862
No, he's a common electrician.
A pole-man!

40:47.304 --> 40:49.363
He spent his whole life on poles,

40:50.273 --> 40:51.865
with pliers and cutters.

40:52.009 --> 40:57.037
I'm the one who got him down
and asked him: "Comrade,

40:57.180 --> 40:59.512
"will you join our side?"
"Yes," he said.

40:59.649 --> 41:02.948
"Will you obey the rules

41:03.086 --> 41:04.849
"and the orders?"
"Yes."

41:04.988 --> 41:06.148
Until...

41:06.289 --> 41:07.586
he got rich!

41:10.160 --> 41:11.127
Natalija!

41:15.665 --> 41:17.064
An electrician?

41:18.235 --> 41:19.793
A pole-man!

41:23.206 --> 41:27.575
Natalija,
you are our greatest actress

41:27.711 --> 41:31.238
and our suffering people
need you.

41:31.381 --> 41:36.375
And you need
a reasonable, intelligent,

41:36.520 --> 41:38.454
educated man...

41:39.756 --> 41:40.848
An intellectual!

41:42.692 --> 41:44.387
You're right!

41:55.672 --> 41:59.005
Comrade Leka will bring you
to the disciplinary committee.

41:59.142 --> 42:02.578
We expected the guns a week ago.
Where are they?

42:02.712 --> 42:06.341
On the boat.
As soon as I get married, off we go!

42:06.483 --> 42:08.883
They can hear the music
in Belgrade!

42:09.019 --> 42:10.850
Good!
It's Blacky's wedding.

42:10.987 --> 42:12.682
We've had enough crying.

42:15.859 --> 42:18.225
Are these arms or what?

42:23.166 --> 42:24.690
Once the priest marries me,

42:25.202 --> 42:26.829
I'll be at the White Rock
before you.

42:26.970 --> 42:30.201
Comrade Tito!

42:30.941 --> 42:35.878
When will you reach Uzice

42:45.555 --> 42:47.785
"Your hands, so white

42:48.391 --> 42:52.452
"So tender, so soft
As the wings of a bird

42:52.596 --> 42:56.464
"Oh, to see them fly
and land on my face..."

43:15.318 --> 43:16.285
That's enough!

43:17.454 --> 43:18.614
Get out!

43:21.791 --> 43:23.486
What are you doing to me?

43:23.627 --> 43:25.857
We're just talking
about the theatre.

43:26.630 --> 43:28.029
What?

43:28.665 --> 43:31.133
I'll kill myself, I swear!

43:31.701 --> 43:32.998
Don't, my friend!

43:36.106 --> 43:39.542
You know,
I killed two men because of her!

43:39.676 --> 43:40.643
I know.

43:41.311 --> 43:42.869
Why do this to me?

43:43.013 --> 43:44.742
- As for you...
- It wasn't me!

43:44.881 --> 43:46.314
Wasn't you?

43:46.449 --> 43:47.814
It was me, then?

43:55.759 --> 43:58.626
Are you my best friend?

43:58.762 --> 44:00.161
I'm your best friend.

44:00.297 --> 44:02.356
I didn't hear.
Are you my best friend?

44:02.499 --> 44:03.488
I'm your best friend.

44:04.701 --> 44:06.293
Whose wedding is this?

44:06.436 --> 44:09.599
Ours, my love! Our wedding!

44:09.739 --> 44:11.263
Yours, my friend.

44:11.408 --> 44:12.773
- Our wedding, sweetheart.
- Ours, my love!

44:19.316 --> 44:23.878
You wanted a ride, did you?
Well, giddy-up, you stud!

44:50.814 --> 44:52.179
Where's the priest?

44:52.882 --> 44:54.873
He'll be here any minute now.

44:55.919 --> 45:01.084
Is it moonlight at noon

45:05.428 --> 45:09.524
Is it sunshine at midnight

45:12.902 --> 45:16.394
From the skies above
Light is beaming...

45:17.574 --> 45:19.599
The Germans! A catastrophe!

45:19.743 --> 45:24.077
Nobody knows, nobody knows

45:24.214 --> 45:27.308
What is really shining

45:29.753 --> 45:33.484
The two of you
could make one good man!

45:35.091 --> 45:36.683
You pest!

45:39.996 --> 45:43.432
Get out of the cars!
Spread out!

45:43.566 --> 45:45.261
Left and right of the boat!

45:52.208 --> 45:54.108
Marko!

45:55.512 --> 45:57.605
Petar Popara!

45:58.415 --> 46:00.406
You fools!

46:01.451 --> 46:03.078
You can't play cat and mouse!

46:03.219 --> 46:04.243
Franz!

46:04.387 --> 46:06.480
Come out now!

46:07.490 --> 46:10.926
And bring Natalija with you
or I'll shoot you all!

46:11.061 --> 46:14.326
How come? I killed him.

46:14.464 --> 46:15.488
You didn't.

46:15.632 --> 46:17.327
He wears a bullet-proof vest.

46:17.467 --> 46:19.094
Aim at his head next time.

46:19.235 --> 46:22.466
I'll smoke one more cigarette.

46:22.605 --> 46:25.096
And then my patience runs out.

46:25.241 --> 46:28.176
After that,
I want you out in the open.

46:29.779 --> 46:30.803
Do you hear me?

46:34.150 --> 46:35.617
Don't shoot!

46:35.752 --> 46:37.720
Don't shoot!

46:46.363 --> 46:47.330
Catastrophe!

46:52.035 --> 46:53.730
My sweet saviour!

46:55.372 --> 46:56.430
My dearest...

47:01.010 --> 47:02.875
Schulz, get out!

47:10.954 --> 47:12.478
Now let's send

47:12.622 --> 47:15.819
this shit-load of criminals
back where they belong!

47:15.959 --> 47:19.690
My little white dove!

47:31.107 --> 47:33.575
Have fun, you idiots!

47:34.444 --> 47:36.878
You won't forget me in a hurry!

47:49.759 --> 47:51.386
Shoot, my friend!

47:54.431 --> 47:55.762
Golub, don't shoot!

47:57.000 --> 47:58.024
Catastrophe!

47:58.168 --> 48:00.136
Shoot, my friend!

48:12.515 --> 48:13.812
Where are the weapons, Blacky?

48:17.320 --> 48:19.720
Where are the trains
with the weapons, bastard?

48:22.559 --> 48:24.254
Treacherous swine!

48:28.798 --> 48:31.392
I'll fry Tito out of your head!

49:10.874 --> 49:11.898
Well?

49:13.109 --> 49:14.337
Is he talking?

49:15.311 --> 49:18.280
No. He just keeps cursing.

49:21.017 --> 49:22.177
Petar Popara!

49:22.318 --> 49:25.446
Fucking fascist motherfucker!

49:33.062 --> 49:34.359
You'll talk!

49:34.797 --> 49:37.732
Keep on raising the current.

49:40.169 --> 49:42.501
Marry uncle Blacky, sis.

49:42.639 --> 49:44.504
He's the greatest.

49:44.641 --> 49:45.767
Forget uncle Blacky!

49:45.909 --> 49:47.069
Here's Franz!

49:47.210 --> 49:48.768
Blacky's the greatest!

49:48.912 --> 49:50.038
Stop pestering me.

49:50.179 --> 49:52.841
What did he say?

49:52.982 --> 49:56.975
He asked when he can be released.

49:58.721 --> 50:00.211
Next week, my boy.

50:02.125 --> 50:04.218
He can go
to a sanatorium in Austria.

50:04.360 --> 50:06.624
A sanatorium in Austria?

50:06.763 --> 50:10.358
Yes, he'll be safe there.

50:10.500 --> 50:12.730
I can't help him here.
It's too dangerous.

50:20.343 --> 50:21.310
Good morning!

50:22.645 --> 50:23.771
Good morning!

50:26.349 --> 50:29.614
Did the kid vomit during the night?

50:31.988 --> 50:33.182
Yes.

50:34.324 --> 50:35.848
No.

50:35.992 --> 50:37.789
Did he...

50:39.529 --> 50:41.190
or didn't he?

50:42.532 --> 50:44.022
I don't know.

50:45.068 --> 50:46.660
Well, he didn't.

50:47.937 --> 50:49.564
Tell him

50:49.706 --> 50:50.968
that he must not worry.
Please, tell him...

50:58.781 --> 51:00.510
Burst him!

51:00.650 --> 51:02.481
Burst him like a paper bag!

51:04.354 --> 51:06.652
Let go of him!

51:06.789 --> 51:08.450
Like a bag!

51:08.591 --> 51:10.058
Burst him like a bag!

51:12.095 --> 51:14.086
You killed my Franz!

51:23.840 --> 51:25.398
Is he dead?

51:26.976 --> 51:29.376
Not yet!

51:30.513 --> 51:32.913
Forgive me, Franz. I'm sorry.

51:43.026 --> 51:44.687
Damn your Franz! Come on.

51:52.101 --> 51:55.036
- What's wrong with this shit?
- Put it on level 5.

51:55.171 --> 51:56.866
It might kill him.

51:57.006 --> 51:58.439
Kill me... my ass!

51:58.574 --> 51:59.905
Let me try.

52:05.882 --> 52:07.008
It doesn't work.

52:12.522 --> 52:13.682
Switch it on.

52:25.234 --> 52:26.292
Hey, man,

52:26.436 --> 52:28.063
wake up!

52:28.204 --> 52:29.899
Good afternoon.

52:30.840 --> 52:33.934
Let's see what's going on.

52:38.514 --> 52:40.038
What's wrong?

52:40.183 --> 52:41.343
He tested the generator.

52:41.484 --> 52:42.849
Is it working?

52:42.985 --> 52:44.976
Yes, he's dead!

52:45.121 --> 52:48.488
- That one didn't flinch.
- He's an electrician.

52:48.624 --> 52:49.750
An electrician?

52:50.526 --> 52:52.357
A pole-man!

53:05.141 --> 53:06.506
My friend...

53:06.809 --> 53:10.074
Give me a grenade.
If they catch me, I'll choose.

53:10.213 --> 53:12.306
Here you are. Let's go.

53:17.286 --> 53:18.844
Thank you, Marko.

53:22.625 --> 53:25.458
Those crazy people
are so sad...

53:25.595 --> 53:26.653
Indeed.

53:35.104 --> 53:37.368
We're all crazy, Natalija.

53:42.278 --> 53:46.647
We just haven't been...
diagnosed yet.

53:48.951 --> 53:50.748
Where's uncle Blacky?

53:51.721 --> 53:53.746
In the trunk, my boy.

53:53.890 --> 53:55.448
In the trunk?

54:02.965 --> 54:04.091
In the trunk?

54:05.568 --> 54:06.796
Uncle Blacky!

54:13.109 --> 54:17.409
Fucking fascist motherfuckers!

54:28.691 --> 54:30.158
Ivan!

54:30.293 --> 54:31.783
Golub!

54:32.728 --> 54:34.753
Get some bandages ready!
Hang on, my friend!

54:36.098 --> 54:38.293
Bring the bandages,
for fuck's sake!

54:38.434 --> 54:40.595
Come and help. Hold Jovan.

54:40.736 --> 54:41.760
Jovan!

54:43.139 --> 54:45.835
Fuck the monkey, help the man!

54:54.417 --> 54:55.543
Pedal faster.

54:55.685 --> 54:58.017
We need more light.

54:58.721 --> 55:00.120
Mind his leg!

55:00.256 --> 55:03.748
God, Comrade Blacky,
what did they do to you?

55:03.893 --> 55:06.453
Fucking fascist motherfuckers!

55:07.830 --> 55:09.627
Catastrophe!

55:09.765 --> 55:12.256
Jovan...

55:12.401 --> 55:13.459
Comrade Marko!

55:14.036 --> 55:15.901
Call your grandad,
he'll cure him.

55:16.038 --> 55:17.938
The water from the well
is medicinal.

55:19.075 --> 55:20.167
Gently...

55:21.043 --> 55:23.238
Tell the comrades about the arms.

55:23.379 --> 55:25.574
Don't worry, I'll see to the weapons.

55:25.715 --> 55:27.148
Look at Jovan!

55:27.283 --> 55:28.944
Your son!

55:29.085 --> 55:30.416
This is your dad.

55:30.553 --> 55:32.384
Show him his dad!

55:32.521 --> 55:37.618
Jovan! My son!

55:42.798 --> 55:45.596
Give your dad a kiss!
Kiss your dad!

56:22.104 --> 56:25.198
This room is dedicated to me!

56:29.178 --> 56:30.509
My room!

56:31.447 --> 56:32.539
Right...

56:33.416 --> 56:35.111
Yes!

56:35.251 --> 56:39.620
This room and this house!

56:39.755 --> 56:44.818
And this country and the sky,
stars, rain, sun, moon and clouds...

56:45.828 --> 56:48.092
even when the sky is bright!

56:49.298 --> 56:50.287
It's all mine...

56:51.901 --> 56:54.028
Yes. All of it!

57:10.119 --> 57:12.986
- Who's bombing us now?
- The Allies.

57:13.122 --> 57:16.182
When it's not the Germans,
the Allies bomb us.

57:18.427 --> 57:19.416
Where are you going?

57:20.896 --> 57:21.954
To the cellar.

57:22.098 --> 57:23.065
Come to me!

57:23.599 --> 57:25.157
Come to me!

57:29.138 --> 57:30.400
Are you afraid?

57:31.707 --> 57:34.175
Not when I'm with you.

57:42.952 --> 57:44.010
Drink up!

57:44.153 --> 57:45.780
You know I don't drink.

57:45.921 --> 57:47.650
Don't be afraid, drink!

57:54.897 --> 57:55.955
It's sweet, not strong!

57:56.098 --> 57:57.963
Indeed...

58:12.448 --> 58:16.646
"I do not know, my dear
If this is a dream

58:18.020 --> 58:19.885
"What year it is
And what day

58:21.257 --> 58:24.226
"And I don't know, my dear
If I am yours

58:25.628 --> 58:29.860
"Or if you are my dream"

58:31.700 --> 58:33.861
Who did you write that for?

58:34.537 --> 58:35.868
Confess!

58:36.005 --> 58:37.097
For you.

58:39.075 --> 58:40.042
You're lying!

58:43.179 --> 58:44.203
You're lying...

58:44.346 --> 58:45.313
I'm not lying.

58:46.182 --> 58:47.240
You're lying.

58:47.383 --> 58:48.611
I never lie.

58:51.487 --> 58:52.613
Never!

58:52.755 --> 58:53.881
Never!

58:56.392 --> 59:00.761
Marko, you lie so beautifully.

59:18.180 --> 59:19.545
Easter, April, 1944

59:19.682 --> 59:21.616
The Allied bombs destroyed

59:21.750 --> 59:24.344
what the Nazis
had left of Belgrade...

01:00:05.861 --> 01:00:09.661
Freedom!

01:01:12.995 --> 01:01:15.429
...from our homeland.
They try to tear out

01:01:15.564 --> 01:01:18.055
part of our body.

01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:21.033
With guns, we won the plebiscite!

01:01:21.170 --> 01:01:23.365
With guns,
we defended freedom!

01:01:23.505 --> 01:01:25.473
With guns,
we'll defend Trieste!

01:02:04.013 --> 01:02:06.607
Part Two - The Cold War

01:02:06.982 --> 01:02:09.473
Years passed, Marko became

01:02:09.618 --> 01:02:11.882
a close collaborator of Tito.

01:02:12.021 --> 01:02:14.216
In Belgrade, in 1961, he paid his debt

01:02:14.356 --> 01:02:16.085
to his great friend, Blacky.

01:02:34.009 --> 01:02:35.033
Comrade Marko...

01:02:35.177 --> 01:02:40.046
I must ask you again...
Could Comrade Natalija be in the film?

01:02:40.182 --> 01:02:41.308
No.

01:02:41.450 --> 01:02:43.577
But this film
is based on your memoirs

01:02:43.719 --> 01:02:45.846
and she is our greatest actress!

01:02:45.988 --> 01:02:50.687
Exactly. The film is dedicated
to the Revolution, not to us.

01:02:50.826 --> 01:02:54.592
Will you at least visit the set?
We'd be honoured.

01:02:54.730 --> 01:02:55.788
That we will do.

01:02:55.931 --> 01:02:58.297
Comrades...

01:02:58.434 --> 01:03:02.370
it is my honour to inaugurate
this Cultural Centre

01:03:02.504 --> 01:03:07.373
as well as unveil the statue
of our Hero, Petar Popara Blacky.

01:03:08.410 --> 01:03:11.470
Blacky symbolizes
our anti-fascist struggle!

01:03:12.147 --> 01:03:17.107
His image and work will forever
be remembered by us, his friends,

01:03:17.252 --> 01:03:18.776
his comrades in arms,

01:03:18.921 --> 01:03:22.220
and by future generations
who from early youth

01:03:22.358 --> 01:03:25.384
will come to this Cultural Centre

01:03:25.527 --> 01:03:28.428
to inspire themselves
with the ideas for which

01:03:28.564 --> 01:03:33.331
our brother, our comrade,
our friend,

01:03:33.469 --> 01:03:38.031
our Blacky gave his life and youth.

01:03:55.557 --> 01:03:57.752
I'll use this occasion,

01:03:57.893 --> 01:04:02.159
even if it means taking your time,
to quote some lines

01:04:02.297 --> 01:04:05.630
from my last book of poems
on the Struggle for Freedom.

01:04:12.875 --> 01:04:17.869
"Why is the wind always blowing
when we remember our beloved?

01:04:19.381 --> 01:04:23.283
"Why does the wind beat the windows
and doors of our brothers?

01:04:24.386 --> 01:04:30.256
"Is the wind only blowing
or is the sky crying with us?"

01:04:31.593 --> 01:04:33.993
Petar Popara Blacky, our friend!

01:04:34.129 --> 01:04:35.721
We honour your memory!

01:04:35.864 --> 01:04:37.832
We honour his memory!

01:04:43.172 --> 01:04:45.834
Is it moonlight at noon

01:04:49.211 --> 01:04:51.304
Is it sunshine at midnight

01:04:53.715 --> 01:04:57.082
From the skies above
Light is beaming

01:04:57.219 --> 01:05:00.518
Nobody knows, nobody knows...

01:05:31.487 --> 01:05:34.456
The Soviet divisions
are surrounded.

01:05:34.590 --> 01:05:39.459
General von Kleist's armoured units
have breached their lines...

01:05:41.563 --> 01:05:43.793
That's it, girl!

01:05:51.340 --> 01:05:52.602
More light!

01:05:54.743 --> 01:05:55.710
Dad!

01:05:55.911 --> 01:05:56.935
Dad!

01:05:59.581 --> 01:06:00.548
Bring some water!

01:06:01.850 --> 01:06:02.976
What happened?

01:06:07.155 --> 01:06:08.520
Nothing, my friend.

01:06:08.657 --> 01:06:10.716
The Gestapo tortured me.

01:06:10.859 --> 01:06:12.190
Fucking fascist motherfuckers!

01:06:12.327 --> 01:06:14.727
Fucking fascist motherfuckers!

01:06:16.999 --> 01:06:21.231
Let me go out with you
and the war will be over in 3 days.

01:06:21.370 --> 01:06:23.702
- Not yet.
- Why wait?

01:06:23.839 --> 01:06:26.433
Tito orders you to wait.

01:06:26.575 --> 01:06:28.202
Tito?

01:06:32.915 --> 01:06:34.746
He said to me:

01:06:34.883 --> 01:06:38.910
"Give Blacky my regards
and tell him not to move.

01:06:39.054 --> 01:06:41.614
"He'll be precious to me
in the final battle."

01:06:41.757 --> 01:06:43.748
- He said that?
- Every word.

01:06:43.892 --> 01:06:45.484
He sent you a watch.

01:06:52.968 --> 01:06:55.596
No, Marko, I can't...

01:06:55.737 --> 01:06:57.102
With a dedication!

01:06:57.239 --> 01:06:58.365
To me?

01:07:02.744 --> 01:07:03.972
To you.

01:07:13.155 --> 01:07:17.114
Comrade Tito

01:07:17.259 --> 01:07:21.923
we swear

01:07:22.064 --> 01:07:24.157
to you

01:07:24.299 --> 01:07:28.702
We swear to you

01:07:28.837 --> 01:07:32.170
Comrade Tito

01:07:32.307 --> 01:07:37.040
we swear to you

01:07:41.183 --> 01:07:46.143
That we won't

01:07:46.288 --> 01:07:48.848
abandon your path

01:08:16.385 --> 01:08:21.220
Comrade Tito

01:08:21.356 --> 01:08:22.448
you, the hope of the people

01:08:27.362 --> 01:08:30.296
You're loved

01:08:30.432 --> 01:08:33.868
by the old

01:08:34.002 --> 01:08:38.769
and the young

01:08:38.907 --> 01:08:45.005
Comrade Tito

01:08:45.147 --> 01:08:50.915
our spring flower

01:08:51.053 --> 01:08:54.352
Serbia

01:08:54.488 --> 01:08:59.221
will not forget you

01:09:03.932 --> 01:09:08.960
A blue violet

01:09:09.104 --> 01:09:14.974
has bloomed

01:09:15.109 --> 01:09:21.515
On the pillow
where Tito's head rests

01:09:31.059 --> 01:09:33.357
Congratulations, Blacky!

01:09:33.495 --> 01:09:38.125
Shake hands with Comrade Marko.
Not with me, with Comrade Marko.

01:09:43.537 --> 01:09:45.028
Are we having a bath?

01:09:47.642 --> 01:09:48.870
Aren't we?

01:09:49.010 --> 01:09:50.033
Yes, a bath!

01:09:52.881 --> 01:09:54.906
What about our business, grandad?

01:09:55.050 --> 01:09:56.540
It's... difficult!

01:09:58.854 --> 01:10:00.788
Are you working on the time?

01:10:00.922 --> 01:10:04.221
I'm reducing the hours for them
as you said.

01:10:04.359 --> 01:10:06.293
Six hours per day!

01:10:07.129 --> 01:10:09.359
Don't overdo it, okay?

01:10:10.532 --> 01:10:14.229
In 20 years,
I've saved them 5 years.

01:10:14.369 --> 01:10:16.360
You can imagine what 5 years less

01:10:16.505 --> 01:10:19.065
in a cellar means?

01:10:56.778 --> 01:11:00.544
Air raid! Come on, comrades!

01:11:00.682 --> 01:11:03.082
Let's go! Hurry up!
Leave the weapons!

01:11:03.218 --> 01:11:05.652
Everybody in the tank!

01:11:05.787 --> 01:11:08.688
The aggressor
is attacking again!

01:11:08.824 --> 01:11:12.225
Don't panic!
Where are you going, you donkey?

01:11:17.666 --> 01:11:21.397
Hurry up, woman.
We'll all get killed because of you.

01:11:25.006 --> 01:11:26.030
Hurry!

01:11:47.329 --> 01:11:56.499
Comrade Tito,
we swear to you...

01:12:06.514 --> 01:12:08.209
Tito, Tito, Tito!

01:12:08.283 --> 01:12:10.615
Everyone sang the same song

01:12:10.752 --> 01:12:13.050
and believed that outside

01:12:13.188 --> 01:12:15.383
the fascists of World War II

01:12:15.523 --> 01:12:17.354
were still in power...

01:12:44.519 --> 01:12:46.111
What are you doing, Marko?

01:12:48.690 --> 01:12:50.214
You'll see.

01:13:32.701 --> 01:13:36.228
Ringe ringe raja
Here comes uncle Paja

01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:46.877
And now?

01:13:49.084 --> 01:13:50.244
Natalija!

01:15:08.563 --> 01:15:10.929
Natalija, Spring is coming

01:15:11.066 --> 01:15:12.499
on a white horse!

01:15:12.634 --> 01:15:15.159
Stop! Cut!

01:15:15.303 --> 01:15:16.668
Cut!

01:15:16.805 --> 01:15:18.898
Why stop?

01:15:20.108 --> 01:15:21.405
What for? Why stop now?

01:15:21.543 --> 01:15:24.944
Yugoslav, fuck you and that water!
You call that rain?

01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:26.672
Stop! Okay!

01:15:26.815 --> 01:15:28.612
Will you ever simply say: act?

01:15:28.750 --> 01:15:30.718
When'll you tell me to act?

01:15:31.786 --> 01:15:33.720
Thank you, lads. Take a break.

01:15:33.855 --> 01:15:35.618
Put the water back on!

01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:41.560
Here he comes! Music!

01:16:10.892 --> 01:16:13.918
Spring is Coming on a White Horse.
Scene 34a, take 2.

01:16:14.062 --> 01:16:15.188
Action!

01:16:16.164 --> 01:16:17.631
The Germans!

01:16:27.008 --> 01:16:29.306
Natalija, darling!

01:16:29.444 --> 01:16:32.436
Spring has arrived
on its white horse.

01:16:47.295 --> 01:16:48.990
Rape!

01:16:58.173 --> 01:17:00.073
No one will catch

01:17:00.208 --> 01:17:03.507
Petar Popara, alias Blacky!

01:17:03.645 --> 01:17:05.078
Natalija!

01:17:31.606 --> 01:17:35.372
Long live the Communist Party
of Yugoslavia!

01:17:37.445 --> 01:17:38.412
Rape!

01:17:42.750 --> 01:17:44.809
Cut! Stop the camera!

01:17:44.953 --> 01:17:47.649
Comrade Marko!

01:17:49.857 --> 01:17:51.654
Get up all of you!

01:17:52.493 --> 01:17:53.619
Stop the rain!

01:17:53.761 --> 01:17:57.697
Comrade artists,
be happy in your work.

01:17:58.600 --> 01:18:00.397
You are portraying...

01:18:01.736 --> 01:18:04.603
great people

01:18:04.739 --> 01:18:06.172
who are no longer with us.

01:18:06.307 --> 01:18:10.607
We owe them a tribute.
Future generations must remember them.

01:18:10.745 --> 01:18:12.679
May you live long, comrade artists!

01:18:16.551 --> 01:18:17.916
Music!

01:18:37.372 --> 01:18:39.840
Cheers, Comrade Marko!

01:18:41.809 --> 01:18:43.276
Comrade Marko...

01:18:44.379 --> 01:18:47.644
allow me to introduce
the heroes of your memoirs.

01:18:53.154 --> 01:18:55.554
Get lost! Not now!

01:19:01.696 --> 01:19:03.323
Are you me?

01:19:05.099 --> 01:19:07.863
Marko!
Yes, I am you.

01:19:11.039 --> 01:19:12.597
Unbelievable!

01:19:17.779 --> 01:19:19.610
He looks just like me.

01:19:20.882 --> 01:19:22.110
Where did you find them?

01:19:22.250 --> 01:19:24.184
Casting is half my job.

01:19:24.319 --> 01:19:27.447
Really? Unbelievable!

01:19:27.588 --> 01:19:30.455
We're cut of the same cloth
and swapped our books for rifles.

01:19:32.994 --> 01:19:36.157
"Shoot, my rifle,
for mother to hear you.

01:19:36.297 --> 01:19:38.857
"Never will I abandon my country
to anyone."

01:19:39.834 --> 01:19:41.267
Well, say hello.

01:19:42.937 --> 01:19:44.302
What do you say?

01:19:44.439 --> 01:19:45.804
She's so sweet!

01:19:45.940 --> 01:19:47.703
Indeed!

01:19:48.810 --> 01:19:50.141
Franz?

01:19:51.079 --> 01:19:52.046
Franz the vampire.

01:19:53.281 --> 01:19:58.844
It's very nice here
but I feel someone is missing.

01:19:58.986 --> 01:20:01.011
God, is he the real Franz
or an actor?

01:20:01.155 --> 01:20:02.645
Who knows?

01:20:02.790 --> 01:20:03.814
An actor.

01:20:03.958 --> 01:20:05.858
Yes, an actor...

01:20:05.993 --> 01:20:10.896
Unbelievable!
It's all just like that night...

01:20:11.032 --> 01:20:14.001
When you killed 11 Germans,
dived into the river...

01:20:14.135 --> 01:20:16.399
- What a memory!
...and saved Blacky and Natalija.

01:20:18.005 --> 01:20:18.994
Indeed!

01:20:20.908 --> 01:20:21.897
Excuse me, please.

01:20:25.813 --> 01:20:26.837
Blacky!

01:20:40.595 --> 01:20:42.756
My friend!

01:20:44.565 --> 01:20:46.294
God, Blacky...

01:20:49.137 --> 01:20:51.697
Why did they kill you, my friend?
Why did they kill you?

01:20:55.276 --> 01:20:57.676
Can someone protect the actors
in this film?

01:20:57.812 --> 01:21:00.303
I've been burnt
three times already!

01:21:00.448 --> 01:21:01.676
Three times!

01:21:15.163 --> 01:21:17.859
Comrade Marko,
it will be a great film!

01:21:30.077 --> 01:21:31.442
Are you afraid of God?

01:21:31.579 --> 01:21:33.604
You mean,
are we afraid of God?

01:21:43.524 --> 01:21:46.925
You'd better learn that text
as it's written.

01:21:47.061 --> 01:21:50.690
Word by word. Understand?

01:22:14.188 --> 01:22:15.712
Sleep tight.

01:22:28.703 --> 01:22:29.931
What is this?

01:22:35.076 --> 01:22:36.737
What you'll tell him

01:22:36.878 --> 01:22:37.845
in the cellar.

01:22:42.183 --> 01:22:43.480
This?

01:22:44.752 --> 01:22:48.745
You know, trash like this,

01:22:48.890 --> 01:22:50.858
whoever the writer

01:22:50.992 --> 01:22:52.687
or the director may be,
is still trash.

01:22:52.827 --> 01:22:54.522
If they ask me what I think,

01:22:54.662 --> 01:22:56.289
here's what I think!

01:23:00.034 --> 01:23:02.867
You're a poet, Marko!

01:23:03.004 --> 01:23:03.971
Stick to poems!

01:23:04.105 --> 01:23:06.471
Natalija, what's missing?

01:23:06.607 --> 01:23:08.472
What's missing?

01:23:08.609 --> 01:23:09.667
The truth!

01:23:09.810 --> 01:23:11.209
The truth?

01:23:11.345 --> 01:23:12.334
Yes, darling!

01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:14.744
You know, the truth...

01:23:25.726 --> 01:23:27.660
No text, my dear,
has any truth in it.

01:23:27.795 --> 01:23:31.925
The truth exists only in real life.

01:23:33.301 --> 01:23:35.269
You are the truth!

01:23:36.470 --> 01:23:38.097
You!

01:23:38.239 --> 01:23:41.675
You are supposed to be the truth.

01:23:42.543 --> 01:23:44.511
There is no truth,
only your conviction

01:23:44.645 --> 01:23:47.239
that what you act is the truth.

01:23:49.817 --> 01:23:51.876
No, art is a lie,

01:23:52.019 --> 01:23:54.078
a big lie!

01:23:54.221 --> 01:23:56.712
We are all liars,
a little bit at least.

01:24:01.796 --> 01:24:03.559
You scum!

01:24:41.902 --> 01:24:46.236
They raped me, beat me...

01:24:46.374 --> 01:24:49.309
What else did they do to me?
What?

01:24:49.443 --> 01:24:51.604
Does it really matter if
those people in the cellar stay alive?

01:24:51.746 --> 01:24:53.907
Yes it does, my dear.

01:24:55.216 --> 01:24:57.684
You write heroic roles for yourself

01:24:57.818 --> 01:25:00.184
and I get to play the whore.

01:25:00.321 --> 01:25:02.949
Anyone can fuck your wife!

01:25:04.625 --> 01:25:06.525
Get dressed
and put the make-up on.

01:25:07.795 --> 01:25:10.992
I said I'd rescue you
in time for the wedding.

01:25:14.933 --> 01:25:16.298
Come on, please.

01:25:16.434 --> 01:25:18.026
Please, get dressed
and put your make-up on.

01:25:18.169 --> 01:25:19.363
I said no.

01:25:21.172 --> 01:25:22.764
I said no!

01:25:24.643 --> 01:25:28.579
I can't act a part
I don't believe in.

01:26:19.030 --> 01:26:20.224
Look what they did to her!

01:26:21.433 --> 01:26:22.627
Fucking fascist

01:26:22.767 --> 01:26:23.756
motherfuckers!

01:26:37.582 --> 01:26:39.379
I love you!

01:26:42.253 --> 01:26:43.311
Hear that?

01:26:50.628 --> 01:26:52.425
She said she loved me...

01:26:54.966 --> 01:26:56.228
What?

01:26:56.367 --> 01:26:57.925
Did you hear that?

01:27:01.372 --> 01:27:02.339
And you?

01:27:07.412 --> 01:27:09.243
She said she loved me.

01:29:18.243 --> 01:29:19.733
He's just like me!

01:29:49.340 --> 01:29:52.366
Dear friends,
welcome to my son's wedding...

01:29:52.510 --> 01:29:53.499
Cut it out!

01:29:55.361 --> 01:29:57.829
This day has come at last.

01:29:57.964 --> 01:30:02.094
My son, dad has bought gold rings.
Give one to your bride.

01:30:03.669 --> 01:30:08.072
Do not be offended
by the modesty of the wedding meal.

01:30:08.207 --> 01:30:10.573
What can we do?
There's a war on.

01:30:10.710 --> 01:30:14.271
But everything we offer
is offered from the heart!

01:30:14.414 --> 01:30:15.847
And if there was no war...

01:30:17.483 --> 01:30:20.816
And if the times were any better,
and if his mother was alive...

01:30:21.020 --> 01:30:22.419
Keep it happy, my friend!

01:30:22.555 --> 01:30:23.522
Thank you, my friend!

01:30:25.124 --> 01:30:27.183
Comrades...

01:30:27.326 --> 01:30:29.954
This is the right moment
for all of us

01:30:30.096 --> 01:30:35.728
to thank Comrade Marko
from the bottom of our hearts

01:30:35.868 --> 01:30:37.859
for all these years
during which

01:30:38.004 --> 01:30:43.237
he has looked after us,
fed us and tended to us.

01:30:43.376 --> 01:30:45.776
I want to say:
Thank you, my Marko!

01:30:47.146 --> 01:30:49.774
Thank you, Comrade Marko!

01:31:01.127 --> 01:31:02.094
Sit down!

01:31:02.228 --> 01:31:05.561
Last month, we produced
200 light weapons.

01:31:05.698 --> 01:31:06.892
Is that nothing?

01:31:07.033 --> 01:31:08.057
No, it's not!

01:31:08.201 --> 01:31:09.361
Bravo!

01:31:09.502 --> 01:31:10.491
Thanks, Marko!

01:31:10.636 --> 01:31:14.436
But our greatest success
is our tank,

01:31:14.574 --> 01:31:17.805
the one we made
with our own hands!

01:31:17.944 --> 01:31:21.175
I am happy and proud of the fact
that the time will soon come

01:31:21.314 --> 01:31:26.581
when we shall use our tank
to liberate our country for good!

01:31:26.719 --> 01:31:29.552
Tank... forward!

01:31:33.726 --> 01:31:35.591
Congratulations, comrades!

01:31:37.663 --> 01:31:38.789
Congratulations!

01:31:47.440 --> 01:31:48.737
Thank you, uncle Marko.

01:32:27.914 --> 01:32:30.280
Whose brats are these?

01:32:30.416 --> 01:32:32.850
They belong to us all.
Play, you fucker!

01:32:35.788 --> 01:32:37.779
We...

01:32:37.924 --> 01:32:42.088
The two of us made this together...

01:32:42.228 --> 01:32:44.890
You shouldn't have.
Thank you, Ivan.

01:32:52.638 --> 01:32:54.469
Come on,
I have something to tell you.

01:32:58.110 --> 01:33:00.203
I need a quick word with him.

01:33:05.551 --> 01:33:06.984
Listen...

01:33:07.119 --> 01:33:10.611
as soon as everyone's drunk,
we'll get out to fight.

01:33:10.756 --> 01:33:12.451
Not a drop until Liberation!

01:33:14.927 --> 01:33:16.417
Marko will be angry.

01:33:16.562 --> 01:33:18.826
I've waited for Marko, the Russians, Tito
and the Party

01:33:18.965 --> 01:33:20.933
for 15 years!
The time's never right.

01:33:21.133 --> 01:33:22.498
The time is now!

01:33:22.635 --> 01:33:24.466
Let's kill the scum and end the war!

01:33:24.604 --> 01:33:26.037
That's it, my son!

01:33:27.540 --> 01:33:28.507
Let's go!

01:33:42.521 --> 01:33:44.079
You little bastards!

01:35:34.900 --> 01:35:38.495
Stop drinking, Natalija.

01:35:38.637 --> 01:35:40.332
- Give me the bottle back.
- What?

01:35:40.473 --> 01:35:42.373
- The bottle!
- I'll give you the bottle all right!

01:35:42.508 --> 01:35:43.475
Here!

01:35:49.014 --> 01:35:50.982
Stop drinking when I tell you.

01:35:52.151 --> 01:35:55.746
I would but I can't look at you
when I'm sober.

01:35:55.888 --> 01:35:58.015
You can't look at me
but you can look at him?

01:35:58.157 --> 01:36:00.955
I thought I could
but I can't either.

01:36:01.093 --> 01:36:03.084
You can't look at him either?

01:36:03.596 --> 01:36:06.394
See this?
This is for you.

01:36:08.200 --> 01:36:10.668
And this is for him.

01:36:13.973 --> 01:36:19.172
I drink brandy and you've been drinking my
blood for 20 years, motherfucker!

01:36:19.945 --> 01:36:22.675
Natalija, you fucking bitch!

01:36:22.815 --> 01:36:26.307
Fuck you and your fucking mother too!

01:36:28.888 --> 01:36:30.355
Where's Blacky?

01:36:35.561 --> 01:36:37.028
How are you?

01:37:02.555 --> 01:37:07.015
Darling! What is it, darling?

01:37:07.159 --> 01:37:09.992
You're crying!

01:37:10.129 --> 01:37:11.721
Why are you crying?

01:37:11.864 --> 01:37:12.956
I don't know.

01:37:14.500 --> 01:37:16.024
Are you happy?

01:37:16.168 --> 01:37:18.159
Yes, I'm happy!

01:37:19.071 --> 01:37:20.834
Are you crying
because you're happy?

01:37:27.179 --> 01:37:32.242
Is it moonlight at noon

01:37:36.956 --> 01:37:40.585
Is it sunshine at midnight

01:37:43.729 --> 01:37:47.722
From the skies above
Light is beaming

01:37:47.867 --> 01:37:50.563
Nobody knows, nobody knows

01:37:51.537 --> 01:37:55.337
Nobody knows, nobody knows

01:37:55.474 --> 01:37:58.500
What is really shining

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:22.126
Motherfucker!

01:38:24.003 --> 01:38:25.061
What's wrong with you?

01:38:25.204 --> 01:38:27.297
My time has come at last!

01:38:28.407 --> 01:38:29.704
Cut it out!

01:38:32.111 --> 01:38:37.174
You too! Here you are!
I've had enough of both of you!

01:38:37.316 --> 01:38:38.840
Enough!

01:38:45.024 --> 01:38:47.390
You pathetic little man!

01:38:48.928 --> 01:38:50.122
What do you want?

01:38:53.365 --> 01:38:54.992
What's wrong, Natalija?

01:38:55.134 --> 01:38:56.226
I wasted my youth!

01:38:56.368 --> 01:38:57.357
What youth?

01:38:57.503 --> 01:39:02.839
Twenty years! Twenty years
of my blood-stained life!

01:39:02.975 --> 01:39:04.636
This is a catastrophe!

01:39:21.961 --> 01:39:23.690
This brandy's good!

01:39:24.096 --> 01:39:26.121
It's strong! Real strong stuff.

01:39:36.175 --> 01:39:39.201
The monkey's getting into the tank!

01:39:39.345 --> 01:39:40.539
A catastrophe!

01:39:52.858 --> 01:39:54.189
The gun's moving!

01:39:54.326 --> 01:39:57.056
He's moving it! A catastrophe!

01:39:59.531 --> 01:40:00.589
Some wine, Natalija?

01:40:03.002 --> 01:40:06.938
Shit, I lost!

01:40:09.808 --> 01:40:11.332
And I chose the rules.

01:40:16.148 --> 01:40:17.979
If there was no war...

01:40:19.852 --> 01:40:23.049
Otchy

01:40:23.188 --> 01:40:25.452
tchernye...

01:40:25.591 --> 01:40:28.389
Otchy strasnye...

01:40:29.862 --> 01:40:34.390
I'd have been the leading lady
of the Moscow State Theatre.

01:40:34.533 --> 01:40:37.161
I'd have performed
in my mother tongue...

01:40:38.303 --> 01:40:39.895
What's this rubbish?

01:40:40.039 --> 01:40:44.169
Since when has your mother
been Russian?

01:40:44.309 --> 01:40:45.970
You're drunk!

01:40:47.112 --> 01:40:48.943
Listen to me...

01:40:49.081 --> 01:40:52.278
You can't talk to her
as if she was your wife!

01:40:52.418 --> 01:40:53.612
Understood?

01:40:53.752 --> 01:40:55.344
You're absolutely right!

01:40:55.487 --> 01:40:58.217
Every good party
needs a Russian song!

01:41:05.898 --> 01:41:08.526
Without the war, I'd have been

01:41:08.667 --> 01:41:10.931
the Yugoslav Maé¢½kovski.

01:41:11.770 --> 01:41:13.169
I'd have gone to his grave
in Moscow,

01:41:13.305 --> 01:41:15.068
bowed and said:

01:41:15.207 --> 01:41:18.233
"You were heard from the heavens
like thunder.

01:41:18.377 --> 01:41:21.778
"We marched along behind you."
Left! Left!

01:41:24.883 --> 01:41:26.874
No one will listen.

01:41:27.019 --> 01:41:29.351
The monkey's in the tank!

01:41:29.488 --> 01:41:30.682
He's smart.

01:41:30.823 --> 01:41:31.949
- It's a catastrophe!
- Get lost!

01:41:34.760 --> 01:41:36.091
What did you want to tell me?

01:41:36.862 --> 01:41:39.330
Something terrible.

01:41:40.632 --> 01:41:41.929
So tell me.

01:41:42.668 --> 01:41:45.364
Later, I don't want
to spoil the wedding.

01:41:45.504 --> 01:41:47.199
Tell me, don't worry.

01:41:49.374 --> 01:41:50.398
What?

01:41:51.376 --> 01:41:54.504
You love Marko, right?
I know that.

01:41:57.649 --> 01:41:58.809
- It's not that.
- It is!

01:41:58.951 --> 01:42:00.578
- It's not.
- It is!

01:42:00.719 --> 01:42:04.519
It's not that. I wanted to tell you
this is all a lie.

01:42:04.656 --> 01:42:07.124
Our whole life is a lie.

01:42:07.259 --> 01:42:09.352
And I can't live without you!

01:42:10.262 --> 01:42:11.854
You can't?

01:42:13.365 --> 01:42:14.354
Oh, come on...

01:42:18.036 --> 01:42:19.799
Music!

01:42:19.938 --> 01:42:21.303
Stop the music!

01:42:22.908 --> 01:42:24.000
Did you hear what I said?

01:42:25.210 --> 01:42:28.202
My son! Listen carefully
to what I say.

01:42:28.347 --> 01:42:30.611
Never trust a lying woman.

01:42:30.749 --> 01:42:32.341
I won't, dad!

01:43:03.248 --> 01:43:06.706
You're frightened, Colonel,
aren't you?

01:43:06.852 --> 01:43:08.945
Stop drinking and talking rubbish!

01:43:09.087 --> 01:43:10.384
Frightened?

01:43:10.522 --> 01:43:11.819
Colonel...

01:43:11.957 --> 01:43:14.721
I'll kill you!
I swear to God I will!

01:43:17.563 --> 01:43:20.930
How could you kill me?
I've been dead for twenty years.

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.992
Try it. Maybe they'll promote you
to Secret Service General.

01:43:26.338 --> 01:43:27.327
Stop it!

01:43:32.110 --> 01:43:36.012
You couldn't give me a child,
so kill me!

01:43:36.148 --> 01:43:37.945
Maybe you can manage that!

01:43:38.083 --> 01:43:41.678
You're evil!

01:43:43.922 --> 01:43:44.889
What am I?

01:43:46.558 --> 01:43:49.026
A murderer! A criminal!

01:43:49.161 --> 01:43:50.423
A thief!

01:43:50.562 --> 01:43:52.587
So I'm evil?

01:43:52.731 --> 01:43:54.460
- Worse than that.
- Worse?

01:43:54.600 --> 01:43:58.297
Do you know why I'm so evil?
Do you?

01:43:58.437 --> 01:44:00.701
Do you know why?

01:44:00.839 --> 01:44:02.101
You're damned!

01:44:02.241 --> 01:44:04.141
Because I love you.

01:44:04.276 --> 01:44:05.834
I love you!

01:44:10.816 --> 01:44:12.340
When you fell for me,

01:44:12.484 --> 01:44:16.818
you put these people down here
to live, die and work for you!

01:44:16.955 --> 01:44:19.321
Because I love you,
don't you see?

01:44:19.458 --> 01:44:21.517
I can't live without you!

01:44:21.660 --> 01:44:23.628
Do they miss anything?

01:44:24.863 --> 01:44:26.091
Yes, a lot!

01:44:28.233 --> 01:44:31.293
You dragged me
into your crime...

01:44:34.473 --> 01:44:36.600
because you love me?

01:44:38.010 --> 01:44:39.739
Only because I love you!

01:44:39.878 --> 01:44:42.346
What else do I have?
Children? Friends?

01:44:42.481 --> 01:44:44.244
You have nothing!

01:44:44.383 --> 01:44:46.180
I have nothing...

01:44:46.318 --> 01:44:48.047
but you...

01:44:48.186 --> 01:44:49.949
if you want that.

01:44:55.327 --> 01:44:57.295
My God...

01:44:58.764 --> 01:45:00.493
You lie so beautifully!

01:45:03.068 --> 01:45:04.330
I never lie!

01:45:17.516 --> 01:45:19.950
What are you doing,
my... friend?

01:45:20.085 --> 01:45:21.916
Just talking.

01:45:22.054 --> 01:45:23.316
Talking?

01:45:26.692 --> 01:45:29.718
And you have to talk in the dark?

01:45:29.861 --> 01:45:31.123
The noise disturbed us.

01:45:35.734 --> 01:45:37.793
The noise disturbed you?

01:45:43.275 --> 01:45:45.334
The party disturbs you?

01:45:50.048 --> 01:45:52.448
- My son's wedding disturbs you?
- You misunderstood me!

01:45:52.584 --> 01:45:55.519
I understood perfectly, believe me.

01:45:58.724 --> 01:46:00.453
I have a headache.

01:46:00.592 --> 01:46:02.025
How surprising!

01:46:11.503 --> 01:46:13.334
Look at them.

01:46:16.441 --> 01:46:17.533
Give it to me...

01:46:23.115 --> 01:46:25.083
My friend...

01:46:25.851 --> 01:46:28.877
let's break the tradition of a friend

01:46:29.020 --> 01:46:31.318
killing his best friend.

01:46:31.456 --> 01:46:33.014
Here's the gun...

01:46:34.726 --> 01:46:35.852
Do the rest yourself!

01:46:38.130 --> 01:46:40.223
- You know why?
- I know.

01:46:42.267 --> 01:46:43.859
I think it's fair.

01:46:54.846 --> 01:46:57.041
I'm a free woman!

01:47:15.200 --> 01:47:18.260
A catastrophe!

01:47:27.512 --> 01:47:29.503
Now we'll see
whose mother will mourn.

01:47:58.477 --> 01:47:59.967
Dad!

01:48:37.215 --> 01:48:38.477
Jovan, my son!

01:48:41.620 --> 01:48:43.110
Get the weapons!

01:48:50.228 --> 01:48:52.992
We're going!

01:48:54.833 --> 01:48:55.800
Where to?

01:48:55.934 --> 01:48:57.697
Outside, to end the war!

01:49:38.677 --> 01:49:40.144
The Germans will kill us.

01:49:40.512 --> 01:49:41.536
But, dad...

01:49:41.680 --> 01:49:42.669
Stop daddying me!

01:49:42.814 --> 01:49:43.940
Come on!

01:49:44.082 --> 01:49:46.550
We're off to war,
not to a brothel!

01:49:46.685 --> 01:49:49.017
The Germans will kill me!

01:49:49.154 --> 01:49:50.815
Right!

01:49:50.956 --> 01:49:53.857
Women and revolution
don't go together. Untie us!

01:50:01.232 --> 01:50:04.793
Don't cry, Natalija.
We won't be parted long this time.

01:50:07.172 --> 01:50:08.799
I'll wait for you!

01:50:13.511 --> 01:50:15.308
I'll wait for you!

01:50:30.795 --> 01:50:31.921
Soni!

01:51:14.606 --> 01:51:15.903
Jovan, my son!

01:51:16.041 --> 01:51:17.008
Dad!

01:51:29.721 --> 01:51:31.416
Smell the Danube?

01:51:31.556 --> 01:51:32.614
I don't.

01:51:32.757 --> 01:51:35.726
You really get on my nerves...
Come on!

01:51:44.536 --> 01:51:46.026
Dad!

01:52:07.192 --> 01:52:08.784
- One question.
- What?

01:52:08.927 --> 01:52:10.224
The colour...

01:52:11.763 --> 01:52:13.390
You call this green?

01:52:13.531 --> 01:52:14.828
Dark green.

01:52:14.966 --> 01:52:16.024
You call this green?

01:52:16.167 --> 01:52:17.896
Green!

01:52:18.036 --> 01:52:20.027
Motherfuckers...

01:52:23.174 --> 01:52:24.368
Fuckers!

01:52:24.509 --> 01:52:26.136
He hates the colour.

01:52:27.679 --> 01:52:30.443
Green!

01:52:30.582 --> 01:52:32.447
Fuck your green!

01:52:32.584 --> 01:52:34.051
Torturer!

01:52:34.185 --> 01:52:35.709
Criminal!

01:52:36.354 --> 01:52:38.584
The director
is waiting for you!

01:52:39.557 --> 01:52:41.218
Keep on pissing...

01:52:41.359 --> 01:52:42.792
Keep on pissing!

01:52:42.927 --> 01:52:43.894
Not for long...

01:52:44.028 --> 01:52:44.995
Not for long!

01:53:02.413 --> 01:53:03.675
Hit out, son!

01:53:04.082 --> 01:53:05.606
Not me, you moron!

01:53:10.588 --> 01:53:13.056
You dare piss on my city?

01:53:13.191 --> 01:53:14.624
- Dad's city!
- My city!

01:53:18.163 --> 01:53:23.226
62, 64, 66, 68, 70...

01:53:23.368 --> 01:53:26.565
Shit!
2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12...

01:53:26.704 --> 01:53:28.729
Madam, where's Jovan?

01:53:28.873 --> 01:53:33.207
- They've gone outside. Someone fired.
- They'll betray us.

01:53:37.849 --> 01:53:39.908
They won't be able to betray anyone.

01:53:41.452 --> 01:53:42.441
They were killed.

01:53:51.429 --> 01:53:54.956
Ringe ringe raja
Here comes Uncle Paja

01:55:06.671 --> 01:55:09.765
We are at this historic spot

01:55:09.908 --> 01:55:12.604
where in the year of 19...

01:55:16.848 --> 01:55:19.373
1944...

01:55:19.517 --> 01:55:24.079
cowardly criminals murdered
our National Hero,

01:55:24.222 --> 01:55:25.780
Petar Popara Blacky.

01:55:37.235 --> 01:55:39.829
Don't be afraid, my son!
Don't be afraid.

01:55:43.408 --> 01:55:44.568
What was that, dad?

01:55:44.709 --> 01:55:46.142
A pheasant.

01:55:47.712 --> 01:55:48.906
Is it dangerous?

01:55:50.014 --> 01:55:51.777
A pheasant? Dangerous?

01:55:51.916 --> 01:55:53.679
It's like a wild hen!

01:55:57.956 --> 01:55:59.787
There's the sun.

01:56:02.093 --> 01:56:03.993
That's the moon, my boy.

01:56:05.196 --> 01:56:06.629
The moon.

01:56:06.764 --> 01:56:08.698
Where's the sun?

01:56:08.833 --> 01:56:10.733
The sun is asleep.

01:56:10.868 --> 01:56:12.130
It is resting.

01:56:24.782 --> 01:56:25.749
Come on!

01:56:29.520 --> 01:56:31.249
Keep down!

01:57:03.354 --> 01:57:06.755
I'm just saying that you

01:57:06.891 --> 01:57:11.328
look so much like Franzi,
and Franzi is short

01:57:11.462 --> 01:57:14.124
for Franz.

01:57:14.265 --> 01:57:16.460
Because "i" is the smallest letter.

01:57:16.601 --> 01:57:17.693
Here we are!

01:57:17.835 --> 01:57:19.735
Franz!

01:57:24.275 --> 01:57:28.473
See that blond man, son?
That's Franz.

01:57:30.581 --> 01:57:32.378
Look at him.

01:57:32.517 --> 01:57:35.145
He hasn't changed in fifteen years.

01:57:38.122 --> 01:57:40.647
That's Germans for you!

01:57:43.561 --> 01:57:45.256
He tortured you.

01:57:46.330 --> 01:57:48.264
And sent Natalija to a camp.

01:57:52.336 --> 01:57:53.325
Perfect!

01:57:53.471 --> 01:57:56.872
A disguise?
He thinks I won't recognize him.

01:57:58.276 --> 01:58:00.676
What's the other one doing?

01:58:04.715 --> 01:58:06.342
A collaborator!

01:58:10.988 --> 01:58:12.979
Franz!

01:58:13.124 --> 01:58:16.821
What's all this smoke?
Sabotage or what?

01:58:37.815 --> 01:58:40.613
Let's make the execution
look as natural as possible.

01:58:42.353 --> 01:58:43.615
What?

01:58:43.754 --> 01:58:46.689
Dad, he looks like you!

01:58:46.824 --> 01:58:49.122
- Who?
- That one!

01:58:49.260 --> 01:58:50.750
The skinny one?

01:58:50.895 --> 01:58:52.692
You really get on my nerves!

01:58:52.830 --> 01:58:56.095
I could belt you at times.
You're just like your mother.

01:58:56.234 --> 01:59:00.398
I don't believe it!
You ask me to act naturally!

01:59:00.538 --> 01:59:03.996
- I didn't say that!
- Yes, you did. I'm not stupid.

01:59:04.142 --> 01:59:06.372
You did say that.

01:59:06.511 --> 01:59:07.500
Honestly...

01:59:11.682 --> 01:59:14.617
Come on, don't be touchy!

01:59:14.752 --> 01:59:18.381
Honestly, I don't know
what I'm supposed to do now!

01:59:18.523 --> 01:59:20.457
Hold on!

01:59:20.591 --> 01:59:22.081
Is this natural for you?

01:59:27.331 --> 01:59:29.196
Honestly, man...

01:59:29.333 --> 01:59:31.130
Come and shoot me!

01:59:31.269 --> 01:59:32.793
That's it!

01:59:32.937 --> 01:59:36.270
Here's the gun and the camera,
now shoot me!

01:59:36.407 --> 01:59:40.036
The one like you
seems very brave.

01:59:40.178 --> 01:59:42.544
All brave people look like me.

01:59:42.680 --> 01:59:45.080
Are you soldiers
or ballerinas?

01:59:45.216 --> 01:59:46.308
Look at you!

01:59:46.450 --> 01:59:48.577
Come on, roll!

01:59:48.719 --> 01:59:52.211
Where's the smoke?
Never there when it's needed!

01:59:56.160 --> 01:59:59.186
Get away from me! Now!

01:59:59.330 --> 02:00:04.131
Look what he's doing.
He'd stop at nothing!

02:00:04.268 --> 02:00:07.260
That's true. But he's the best
I've ever worked with.

02:00:07.405 --> 02:00:09.839
And I've worked with quite a few...

02:00:09.974 --> 02:00:13.501
He gives us room to improvise.

02:00:13.644 --> 02:00:17.580
Get lost! Get away from me!
I can't concentrate!

02:00:17.715 --> 02:00:18.943
Tell her!

02:00:20.818 --> 02:00:21.978
Get to your places.

02:00:22.119 --> 02:00:25.088
"Spring Comes on a White Horse",
scene 32a, take one.

02:00:26.691 --> 02:00:27.715
Action!

02:00:27.858 --> 02:00:30.884
Get rid of that! Get rid of it!

02:00:31.028 --> 02:00:34.156
I want to look death in the eye!

02:00:34.298 --> 02:00:36.198
Would you like one last cigarette?

02:00:44.508 --> 02:00:49.036
Long live the Communist Party
of Yugoslavia!

02:00:49.180 --> 02:00:51.307
Take aim!

02:00:57.388 --> 02:00:58.855
What happened?

02:01:00.024 --> 02:01:01.685
That's it! Natural!

02:01:01.826 --> 02:01:04.056
That's natural!

02:01:05.997 --> 02:01:06.964
Go on!

02:01:07.098 --> 02:01:10.625
What do you mean?
We never agreed on this!

02:01:10.768 --> 02:01:13.328
Go on acting!
Don't interrupt the shot!

02:01:13.471 --> 02:01:15.268
Act!

02:01:15.406 --> 02:01:17.897
Call this directing? God!

02:01:18.042 --> 02:01:22.979
Long live the Communist Party
of Yugoslavia!

02:01:23.114 --> 02:01:25.810
Under the leadership
of Comrade Tito!

02:01:25.950 --> 02:01:28.475
Fucking fascist motherfuckers!

02:01:32.290 --> 02:01:36.454
Don't interrupt the sequence,
you idiots!

02:01:40.865 --> 02:01:42.457
Throw it, son!

02:01:57.948 --> 02:01:59.279
Charge!

02:02:04.689 --> 02:02:06.657
Just like me!

02:02:06.791 --> 02:02:07.758
Where's security?

02:02:37.388 --> 02:02:41.916
Comrade, you want a ride
to West Germany?

02:02:47.164 --> 02:02:48.495
I'm looking for

02:02:48.632 --> 02:02:53.069
my monkey, Soni...

02:02:53.204 --> 02:02:58.107
You haven't seen him by any chance,
have you?

02:02:58.242 --> 02:03:00.870
You're looking for your monkey?

02:03:01.011 --> 02:03:05.505
Yes, his name's Soni.

02:03:23.100 --> 02:03:24.499
A horse!

02:03:27.738 --> 02:03:30.468
Jovan, sunshine, that's a deer.

02:03:30.608 --> 02:03:32.041
A deer?

02:03:32.910 --> 02:03:34.571
That's how you drew horses.

02:03:34.712 --> 02:03:36.236
It's a deer.

02:03:44.555 --> 02:03:45.579
Jelena!

02:03:48.325 --> 02:03:50.418
It can't be Jelena, sunshine.

02:03:50.561 --> 02:03:53.121
Calm down, son, calm down!

02:03:53.264 --> 02:03:54.561
What's that?

02:03:56.634 --> 02:03:59.967
That's nothing.
Just a fish.

02:04:00.104 --> 02:04:04.473
I fished 25-pounders right here
before the war.

02:04:05.743 --> 02:04:07.472
God, I was really scared.

02:04:07.611 --> 02:04:09.704
I was afraid for Jelena.

02:04:09.847 --> 02:04:11.747
Don't be afraid, my boy.

02:04:16.921 --> 02:04:19.253
I want to go back to the cellar.

02:04:37.908 --> 02:04:40.843
Could anyone
start protecting us artists?

02:04:40.978 --> 02:04:44.004
Could anyone look after us?
We work day and night

02:04:44.148 --> 02:04:48.141
for our comrades!
And we go through hell!

02:04:48.285 --> 02:04:49.684
Calm down.

02:04:49.820 --> 02:04:51.481
What do you mean, calm down?

02:04:51.622 --> 02:04:54.250
We could've been killed!

02:04:55.226 --> 02:04:58.753
You do your job,
let me do mine.

02:04:58.896 --> 02:05:01.091
I can't do my job!

02:05:01.232 --> 02:05:03.632
You must protect
my set and my life!

02:05:03.767 --> 02:05:08.329
My life was in danger here!

02:05:08.472 --> 02:05:10.497
I'll tell you...

02:05:10.641 --> 02:05:13.576
I didn't want to in front of him.
He's responsible.

02:05:13.711 --> 02:05:15.406
- It's his fault.
- Whose?

02:05:15.546 --> 02:05:17.946
The director's.
Shouting all the time:

02:05:18.082 --> 02:05:21.210
"Be natural! The more natural,
the more terrifying."

02:05:21.352 --> 02:05:24.583
And what happened?
He got his natural and terrifying.

02:05:26.724 --> 02:05:30.251
Honestly...

02:06:14.805 --> 02:06:17.774
How beautiful this world is!

02:06:17.908 --> 02:06:19.375
Congratulations!

02:06:48.772 --> 02:06:50.797
Careful, dad, you'll drown!

02:06:55.946 --> 02:06:57.174
Come for a swim.

02:07:02.186 --> 02:07:04.484
Come on, sunshine!

02:07:04.622 --> 02:07:08.581
Come on in!
Do you hear me?

02:07:08.726 --> 02:07:10.091
Jovan, my son!

02:07:12.029 --> 02:07:13.758
Come on!

02:07:13.897 --> 02:07:15.592
I can't swim, dad!

02:08:33.744 --> 02:08:36.178
Don't be afraid, son.

02:08:36.313 --> 02:08:37.439
Dad's here.

02:08:38.782 --> 02:08:41.012
Come on, swim!

02:08:44.188 --> 02:08:48.352
First your leg!
Then your arm!

02:08:48.492 --> 02:08:53.191
First left! Then right!

02:08:55.733 --> 02:08:59.134
- I'm swimming!
- Of course, I'm holding you.

02:08:59.269 --> 02:09:00.793
Close your mouth!

02:10:19.750 --> 02:10:22.275
Where is the kid now?

02:10:22.419 --> 02:10:24.046
He really gets on my nerves!

02:10:40.337 --> 02:10:42.202
Son!

02:11:17.341 --> 02:11:19.309
There is no life for us
in this country.

02:11:19.977 --> 02:11:21.444
No, my love...

02:11:37.995 --> 02:11:42.694
We can't go on living...

02:11:42.833 --> 02:11:45.165
with lunatics...

02:11:45.302 --> 02:11:47.862
madmen...

02:11:48.005 --> 02:11:50.132
psychopaths...

02:11:50.274 --> 02:11:51.536
maniacs...

02:11:51.675 --> 02:11:53.370
liars...

02:11:53.510 --> 02:11:55.341
thieves...

02:11:55.479 --> 02:11:56.673
criminals...

02:11:56.813 --> 02:11:57.837
murderers...

02:11:57.981 --> 02:11:59.073
Can we?

02:11:59.716 --> 02:12:00.683
No, we can't.

02:12:03.553 --> 02:12:04.577
We can't, my love.

02:12:08.859 --> 02:12:09.848
There.

02:12:13.196 --> 02:12:17.565
There's no place
for an honest man in this country.

02:12:17.701 --> 02:12:19.134
No place at all.

02:12:19.903 --> 02:12:20.927
Under the bearing wall!

02:13:19.763 --> 02:13:21.424
Are you sure?

02:13:22.566 --> 02:13:23.794
I'm sure.

02:13:48.959 --> 02:13:52.087
Marko Dren's disappearance coincided

02:13:52.229 --> 02:13:54.493
with the loss of the secret formula

02:13:54.631 --> 02:13:56.565
of Tito's Yugoslavia.

02:13:56.700 --> 02:13:58.895
Tito, having lost his friend,

02:13:59.036 --> 02:14:00.435
fell ill.

02:14:00.570 --> 02:14:02.970
Twenty years later, he died...

02:16:21.745 --> 02:16:24.509
Part Three - The War

02:16:24.614 --> 02:16:27.276
1992 - Berlin.
Ivan still hoped to see Soni...

02:16:32.222 --> 02:16:33.382
Mircovic,

02:16:33.522 --> 02:16:36.458
where did this marvel come from?

02:16:36.593 --> 02:16:38.356
Officially, he's dead.

02:16:38.495 --> 02:16:41.464
Dead?
On the contrary, he looks good.

02:16:41.598 --> 02:16:43.326
You said officially?

02:16:43.466 --> 02:16:45.093
The Yugoslav embassy says so.

02:16:46.169 --> 02:16:51.266
A man bearing the same name
died in 1941

02:16:51.407 --> 02:16:54.707
during the bombing of Belgrade.

02:16:54.843 --> 02:16:57.835
He was the zoo-keeper.

02:16:57.981 --> 02:16:59.744
Do you know if...

02:16:59.883 --> 02:17:01.009
Look

02:17:01.151 --> 02:17:02.618
what he drew for me.

02:17:02.752 --> 02:17:04.719
If he was an Indian,

02:17:04.853 --> 02:17:08.187
they'd call him
He Who Surrenders.

02:17:09.492 --> 02:17:11.959
He told me unbelievable things.

02:17:12.094 --> 02:17:13.119
He says

02:17:13.263 --> 02:17:15.458
he lived the whole time in a cellar.

02:17:15.599 --> 02:17:17.965
Communism was one big cellar.

02:17:18.101 --> 02:17:19.692
The whole planet

02:17:19.835 --> 02:17:20.962
is a cellar.

02:17:21.103 --> 02:17:23.197
I'm going to Portugal this summer.

02:17:23.340 --> 02:17:27.504
Perhaps he could show me
an underground motorway.

02:17:30.146 --> 02:17:31.909
Happy New Year!

02:17:37.687 --> 02:17:39.620
Happy New Year, Ivan!

02:17:39.755 --> 02:17:41.053
It isn't for me!

02:17:41.191 --> 02:17:45.093
Why do you cry all the time?

02:17:45.227 --> 02:17:48.754
I want to go home
to Yugoslavia!

02:17:48.897 --> 02:17:52.129
There's a war over there.
A horrifying war!

02:17:52.269 --> 02:17:53.701
I know.

02:17:53.837 --> 02:17:55.736
Not the war you're thinking of.

02:17:55.871 --> 02:17:59.740
In our country,
there's only our war.

02:17:59.876 --> 02:18:03.277
World War II ended 50 years ago.

02:18:03.413 --> 02:18:05.278
And the Germans won.

02:18:05.415 --> 02:18:07.110
No, they didn't, they lost.

02:18:07.250 --> 02:18:11.186
So why are they celebrating?

02:18:12.455 --> 02:18:16.016
You're lying to me, doctor.

02:18:16.159 --> 02:18:17.888
You work for the Germans.

02:18:18.028 --> 02:18:20.087
You work for them, don't you?

02:18:20.230 --> 02:18:22.858
Yes, I work for them
but not those Germans.

02:18:25.067 --> 02:18:26.695
You're a traitor!

02:18:26.835 --> 02:18:30.101
What am I?
A traitor?

02:18:33.910 --> 02:18:35.775
I'll show who the traitor is!

02:18:35.912 --> 02:18:39.040
I didn't want to show you this

02:18:39.182 --> 02:18:42.117
but look for yourself.

02:18:42.252 --> 02:18:45.915
Who's on these Interpol warrants?
Look.

02:18:46.056 --> 02:18:47.647
Who?

02:18:47.790 --> 02:18:51.625
My brother Marko and Natalija.

02:18:51.761 --> 02:18:54.321
They're wanted by the police
throughout the world.

02:18:55.665 --> 02:18:59.327
They killed some people in a cellar, traded
arms...

02:18:59.468 --> 02:19:02.233
The crates were stamped
with a monkey.

02:19:02.371 --> 02:19:04.032
Your Soni, maybe.

02:19:08.945 --> 02:19:10.378
Where are you going?

02:19:10.513 --> 02:19:11.537
Ivan!

02:19:20.156 --> 02:19:21.646
What's wrong?

02:19:21.790 --> 02:19:25.487
He lied to me!

02:19:25.628 --> 02:19:27.094
Who lied to you?

02:19:27.230 --> 02:19:31.428
My own brother!

02:19:48.317 --> 02:19:50.309
Don't do anything stupid!

02:19:50.453 --> 02:19:52.421
Ivan, we're not children!
Let's go back!

02:19:55.592 --> 02:19:57.287
Come back!

02:19:59.729 --> 02:20:01.663
Oh, fuck it!

02:20:05.568 --> 02:20:07.035
Stop messing around!

02:20:07.170 --> 02:20:08.569
Come back!

02:20:37.634 --> 02:20:38.999
Wait for me!

02:20:45.842 --> 02:20:47.469
I can't...

02:20:47.610 --> 02:20:49.737
I can't go on!

02:20:49.879 --> 02:20:51.039
I'll die!

02:20:52.515 --> 02:20:53.539
Wait!

02:21:31.187 --> 02:21:32.484
Stop, for God's sake!

02:21:32.622 --> 02:21:34.556
Which way to Italy?

02:21:34.691 --> 02:21:37.524
We don't know. We're lost too.
Where did you come from?

02:21:37.660 --> 02:21:39.651
Bosnia. Where are you going?

02:21:39.796 --> 02:21:42.594
To Yugoslavia.

02:21:42.732 --> 02:21:43.892
No Yugoslavia!

02:21:44.033 --> 02:21:47.400
What do you mean?

02:21:48.438 --> 02:21:50.167
There's no more Yugoslavia!

02:21:50.306 --> 02:21:51.273
Can we come?

02:21:51.407 --> 02:21:55.138
Yes, if you pay DM 1,000.
They paid as well.

02:21:58.147 --> 02:22:00.479
Ivan, wait!

02:22:03.686 --> 02:22:05.313
Let's go to Italy!

02:22:05.455 --> 02:22:07.286
We'll eat spaghetti!

02:22:07.423 --> 02:22:10.722
We'll drink wine!
Let's go with these people!

02:22:10.860 --> 02:22:15.229
What does he mean,
no Yugoslavia?

02:22:15.365 --> 02:22:17.424
I've had enough, Ivan.

02:22:17.567 --> 02:22:20.593
I'm going to Italy
or to fucking hell!

02:22:21.104 --> 02:22:23.504
I can't go on!
Take care.

02:22:23.640 --> 02:22:25.437
Wait!

02:22:25.575 --> 02:22:27.133
Wait for me!

02:22:31.381 --> 02:22:33.849
Take care, Ivan!

02:23:23.933 --> 02:23:25.525
Where...

02:23:25.668 --> 02:23:28.967
have you been?

02:24:05.274 --> 02:24:06.866
Blood...

02:24:35.738 --> 02:24:37.501
Has anyone seen my Jovan?

02:24:37.640 --> 02:24:39.437
No.

02:24:42.011 --> 02:24:43.979
Load!

02:24:51.187 --> 02:24:52.211
Fire!

02:24:54.691 --> 02:24:56.124
Nowhere to be found...

02:24:59.262 --> 02:25:02.459
Fucking fascist motherfuckers!

02:25:30.560 --> 02:25:35.054
I don't have time to bargain,
to haggle over percentages.

02:25:37.934 --> 02:25:41.700
I've come here to help you,
independently

02:25:41.838 --> 02:25:45.137
of our religious, national
and political differences.

02:25:45.274 --> 02:25:48.437
But I ask only one thing of you:
please don't shout.

02:25:48.578 --> 02:25:53.072
We'll reach an agreement
in a civilized, educated way.

02:25:59.122 --> 02:26:01.454
You need me,
not the other way round.

02:26:03.526 --> 02:26:05.153
Don't worry.

02:26:05.294 --> 02:26:08.593
The Serbs kill the Croats
and the Croats kill the Serbs.

02:26:08.731 --> 02:26:09.925
Don't be afraid.

02:26:10.066 --> 02:26:11.795
You're too kind.

02:26:11.934 --> 02:26:13.026
Don't mention it.

02:26:13.169 --> 02:26:15.729
You're young, kid.
You don't understand.

02:26:15.872 --> 02:26:21.401
I do, but you've been abroad too long.
You don't understand our language.

02:26:21.544 --> 02:26:25.480
You're asking too much.
Understand? Too much.

02:26:25.615 --> 02:26:28.311
I'm asking the minimum.

02:26:28.451 --> 02:26:30.282
DM 3 per bullet?

02:26:30.419 --> 02:26:31.408
Minimum!

02:26:31.554 --> 02:26:32.521
$100 per grenade?

02:26:32.655 --> 02:26:34.816
Buy from Hungarians,
you fucker!

02:27:06.722 --> 02:27:08.952
Ivan...

02:27:09.091 --> 02:27:10.524
My brother!

02:27:13.329 --> 02:27:14.990
What are you doing, Ivan?

02:27:16.966 --> 02:27:20.402
Have you gone mad?
It's a sin to kill your brother!

02:27:21.103 --> 02:27:22.764
The greatest sin!

02:27:22.905 --> 02:27:25.203
Don't, Ivan!

02:27:26.909 --> 02:27:30.367
Forgive me, Ivan!

02:27:30.513 --> 02:27:31.707
I saved your life three times.

02:27:37.753 --> 02:27:39.914
I saved your life three times!

02:27:40.990 --> 02:27:42.924
It hurts! Ivan, don't!

02:27:43.292 --> 02:27:45.021
Forgive me, Ivan.

02:27:45.695 --> 02:27:47.822
God sees everything, Ivan.

02:27:49.966 --> 02:27:51.661
God will punish you.

02:27:51.801 --> 02:27:53.564
He'll punish you!

02:28:06.282 --> 02:28:08.147
Lord, forgive me.

02:29:16.619 --> 02:29:18.246
What are you doing?

02:29:40.109 --> 02:29:41.133
My love...

02:29:45.414 --> 02:29:48.474
"No war...

02:29:48.617 --> 02:29:50.346
"is a war...

02:29:50.486 --> 02:29:52.852
"until a brother...

02:29:52.989 --> 02:29:54.581
"kills his brother."

02:30:01.731 --> 02:30:04.700
My love!

02:30:15.745 --> 02:30:18.543
Come on, you old hag!

02:30:19.682 --> 02:30:22.082
Young man, this is my husband.

02:30:22.218 --> 02:30:23.879
Move when I tell you to!

02:30:24.387 --> 02:30:27.220
What are you waiting for?
Get down!

02:30:34.030 --> 02:30:37.989
Comrade Commander, we've captured
16 Chetniks, 30 Ustashas

02:30:38.134 --> 02:30:40.159
and 3 UN men.

02:30:40.302 --> 02:30:45.205
Plus two war profiteers
with a Mercedes.

02:30:45.341 --> 02:30:47.104
What do we do with them?

02:30:47.243 --> 02:30:49.609
Profiteers...

02:30:50.713 --> 02:30:52.305
Execute them on the spot!

02:31:35.424 --> 02:31:39.258
Comrade Blacky!
Pockets searched, soldiers disarmed.

02:31:39.395 --> 02:31:43.024
The profiteers' passports...
What do I do with all these people?

02:31:43.165 --> 02:31:44.530
Take them to the well.

02:31:44.667 --> 02:31:45.759
Any sign of Jovan?

02:31:45.901 --> 02:31:46.959
No.

02:31:47.103 --> 02:31:48.798
No...

02:31:49.839 --> 02:31:51.568
I protest, sir!

02:31:51.707 --> 02:31:53.299
Me too, comrade!

02:31:53.442 --> 02:31:55.000
I'm no "comrade", sir.

02:31:55.144 --> 02:31:57.112
And I'm no "sir", comrade.

02:31:57.246 --> 02:31:59.976
What are you?
Ustasha, Chetnik, partisan?

02:32:00.116 --> 02:32:02.983
I'm Petar Popara Blacky.

02:32:03.119 --> 02:32:05.087
Which army are you in, comrade?

02:32:05.221 --> 02:32:06.381
My own!

02:32:06.522 --> 02:32:08.854
Do you have a superior?

02:32:08.991 --> 02:32:11.721
Yes, my country!

02:32:11.861 --> 02:32:13.590
Fucking fascist motherfucker!

02:32:24.673 --> 02:32:26.937
Marko, my brother!

02:32:27.076 --> 02:32:29.010
Natalija...

02:32:29.145 --> 02:32:30.840
my love!

02:32:41.857 --> 02:32:43.722
I can't find Jovan.

02:34:08.877 --> 02:34:10.606
See, my dear monkey.

02:34:12.281 --> 02:34:13.748
Who would have thought it?

02:34:14.450 --> 02:34:15.712
Nobody.

02:34:18.787 --> 02:34:23.554
Imagine that you have a son,

02:34:23.692 --> 02:34:24.954
a baby monkey.

02:34:26.161 --> 02:34:27.890
And someone hides him from you...

02:34:29.531 --> 02:34:31.522
And you search for him for years...

02:34:31.667 --> 02:34:35.728
But you can't find him anywhere.

02:34:35.871 --> 02:34:39.204
Say, isn't that sad?

02:34:43.345 --> 02:34:45.939
And what a son I had!

02:34:46.081 --> 02:34:47.912
Do you remember my Jovan?

02:34:48.884 --> 02:34:50.374
What was he like?

02:34:52.554 --> 02:34:54.181
A strong lad.

02:34:54.323 --> 02:34:56.120
Just like me!

02:34:59.528 --> 02:35:02.156
There is no more sun

02:35:03.165 --> 02:35:07.363
There is no more moon...

02:35:11.607 --> 02:35:12.869
Did you hear that?

02:35:13.008 --> 02:35:14.032
Did you hear?

02:35:14.910 --> 02:35:17.208
Jovan!

02:35:17.346 --> 02:35:18.813
My son!

02:35:32.594 --> 02:35:34.186
Light of my life!

02:37:24.840 --> 02:37:26.933
Jovan, my son!

02:37:27.776 --> 02:37:29.869
I knew I'd find you! I knew it!

02:37:31.046 --> 02:37:32.445
Who organized this?

02:37:32.581 --> 02:37:33.570
Mum did.

02:37:36.452 --> 02:37:37.510
Here's to you!

02:37:43.659 --> 02:37:44.853
My friend!

02:37:44.993 --> 02:37:47.791
Did she really have to come?

02:37:47.930 --> 02:37:50.797
She's my friend's wife!
Are you crazy?

02:37:50.933 --> 02:37:52.594
I know what's what.

02:37:52.734 --> 02:37:53.758
What do you know?

02:37:53.902 --> 02:37:55.802
I'm not stupid.

02:37:55.938 --> 02:37:57.064
They're married!

02:38:08.484 --> 02:38:10.418
My friend!

02:38:10.552 --> 02:38:12.747
Natalija is a little embarrassed.

02:38:33.108 --> 02:38:34.598
Let me introduce you.

02:38:34.743 --> 02:38:35.835
Meet my friend's wife!

02:38:36.178 --> 02:38:37.941
Pleased to meet you.

02:38:42.484 --> 02:38:43.781
Play louder!

02:38:43.919 --> 02:38:45.944
That's it, Vera!

02:39:04.239 --> 02:39:06.002
Let bygones be bygones.

02:39:12.514 --> 02:39:14.448
He's grown so fast.
Look at him.

02:39:14.583 --> 02:39:16.175
Big guy, isn't he?

02:39:18.720 --> 02:39:21.154
Fifteen years, Vera.

02:39:21.290 --> 02:39:23.383
What do you mean, fifteen?
Twenty!

02:39:23.525 --> 02:39:24.617
No, fifteen.

02:39:24.760 --> 02:39:26.022
- Twenty!
- Fifteen!

02:39:26.161 --> 02:39:27.185
Twenty!

02:39:27.329 --> 02:39:29.456
I know my own son's age!

02:39:31.400 --> 02:39:33.300
My sunshine!

02:39:35.037 --> 02:39:36.334
Sister!

02:39:36.471 --> 02:39:39.201
Bato! My sweet brother!

02:39:39.341 --> 02:39:41.741
You're dancing!

02:39:41.877 --> 02:39:44.107
Marko, look, he's dancing!

02:39:44.246 --> 02:39:45.679
Look, Marko!

02:39:45.814 --> 02:39:47.247
Let's dance together!

02:39:54.823 --> 02:39:56.120
Forgive me?

02:39:56.258 --> 02:39:59.193
I can forgive
but I cannot forget.

02:40:04.733 --> 02:40:07.361
Here we built new houses

02:40:07.502 --> 02:40:10.994
with red roofs
and chimneys where storks will nest.

02:40:11.139 --> 02:40:14.108
With wide-open doors
for dear guests.

02:40:14.242 --> 02:40:18.838
We'll thank the soil for feeding us
and the sun for warming us.

02:40:18.981 --> 02:40:22.439
And the fields for reminding us
of the green grass of home.

02:40:22.584 --> 02:40:27.544
With pain, sorrow and joy,
we shall remember our country,

02:40:27.689 --> 02:40:31.785
as we tell our children
stories that start like fairytales:

02:40:31.927 --> 02:40:34.760
Once upon a time,
there was a country...

02:41:19.307 --> 02:41:23.869
This story has no end...
