WEBVTT

00:16.225 --> 00:19.019
Do my eyes deceive? Is this a ghost?

00:22.481 --> 00:25.943
No, it's the gora who finds all he needs
in the slum.

00:27.611 --> 00:29.321
Hey!

00:29.404 --> 00:30.989
Hail the returning hero.

00:33.033 --> 00:34.034
Hey!

00:35.744 --> 00:38.038
Drinks! We need drinks.

00:38.747 --> 00:40.999
-Hi, Lin. How are you?
-How you going?

00:41.083 --> 00:42.084
Sit down.

00:43.836 --> 00:45.170
Hey.

00:45.254 --> 00:46.255
Hey yourself.

00:50.133 --> 00:51.385
What did you think?

00:53.220 --> 00:57.432
The quality was good.
We can do more business, I think.

00:58.016 --> 00:59.726
Can you handle more weight?

01:00.602 --> 01:02.312
Hey, we can handle whatever you want.

01:03.856 --> 01:07.568
I knew I could trust you, Lisa.
My Bombay good luck charm.

01:07.651 --> 01:09.653
Hey, gora whores are not allowed up here.

01:11.196 --> 01:12.865
She doesn't do that anymore.

01:14.491 --> 01:17.619
And don't call her a whore.

01:19.496 --> 01:20.706
You owe her an apology.

01:22.291 --> 01:23.625
My mistake, madam.

01:27.671 --> 01:30.966
Don't worry about that.
It's okay. It's okay, it's okay.

01:31.049 --> 01:32.050
Thank you.

01:33.218 --> 01:34.219
Salute.

01:35.137 --> 01:37.681
-You know the Borsalino test?
-I don't.

01:37.764 --> 01:43.562
Well, the Borsalino is a garment of
the finest quality, believed by many to be

01:43.645 --> 01:46.899
the most outstanding
gentleman's head covering ever made.

01:47.608 --> 01:49.526
-You know--
-So, it's just a hat?

01:51.153 --> 01:54.990
Now, the test of a real Borsalino hat

01:55.073 --> 01:59.661
is to roll it into a very tight tube
and pass it through a wedding ring.

01:59.745 --> 02:01.997
If it comes out of this ordeal
without creases

02:02.080 --> 02:06.502
and springs back into its original shape,
it is a genuine--

02:06.585 --> 02:08.419
-Borsalino.
-Borsalino.

02:09.588 --> 02:13.842
Now, Bombay and your slum,
they have rolled you into a tube,

02:13.926 --> 02:16.136
and now they're dragging you
into the wedding ring…

02:16.220 --> 02:17.387
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

02:17.471 --> 02:21.141
…to see if you are the real deal or not.

02:22.267 --> 02:23.810
Are you the real deal?

02:25.729 --> 02:28.023
-What do you think?
-I think Didier's drunk.

02:28.899 --> 02:30.526
-Okay.
-Hey, Lin.

02:32.861 --> 02:36.657
Lisa, holy shit. You look great.

02:36.740 --> 02:37.824
-Thanks.
-Are you--

02:37.908 --> 02:40.160
-I'm doing good.
-Yeah?

02:40.244 --> 02:41.286
Better than good.

02:41.912 --> 02:45.624
I just wanted to say hi
and thank you for that first day

02:45.707 --> 02:47.918
and for getting me out of the Palace.

02:48.001 --> 02:50.379
I don't know what I would have done
without you.

02:50.462 --> 02:54.800
Anyway, it meant the world to me,
and I won't ever forget it, so I just…

02:55.884 --> 02:56.885
Okay.

02:56.969 --> 02:59.638
Truly a hero of the people.

02:59.721 --> 03:03.141
-A Borsalino if I ever saw one.
-Take it easy.

03:03.225 --> 03:05.811
-I gotta go.
-What? Come on. Sit with us.

03:08.105 --> 03:09.106
Okay.

03:09.606 --> 03:10.983
So you're still here, huh?

03:11.692 --> 03:12.818
Apparently.

03:14.653 --> 03:17.114
Did you find someone else to blame
for your problems?

03:17.698 --> 03:19.366
Or did you take pity on him after all?

03:19.449 --> 03:21.285
Not sure that's any of your business.

03:21.368 --> 03:24.496
Hey, Lin has found a new life
in the Sagar Wada slum.

03:24.580 --> 03:26.331
-I heard about that.
-You--

03:26.999 --> 03:28.542
That explains the smell.

03:29.710 --> 03:31.545
I guess when you want to feel
like a big man,

03:31.628 --> 03:33.839
the best way is to live among midgets, no?

03:34.339 --> 03:36.800
I don't think you need to guess.
I think you know.

03:36.884 --> 03:40.137
'Cause every day you wake up
and you look in the mirror,

03:40.762 --> 03:43.765
and you're scared shitless
there's someone tiny staring back.

03:44.808 --> 03:47.394
Someone that nobody needs.
And you'd be right, mate.

03:48.478 --> 03:51.440
Compared to you, the people I live with
are King-fucking-Kong.

03:52.816 --> 03:54.776
You should have gone
when you had the chance.

04:02.826 --> 04:04.286
What a fucking prick.

04:04.369 --> 04:06.914
Yeah, watch your back.
He won't forget what you just did.

04:07.831 --> 04:08.832
I hope not.

04:13.670 --> 04:14.505
Drinks!

04:28.769 --> 04:30.437
Can't give everything up at once.

04:35.776 --> 04:39.571
We need to get a record player in here.
Then we could dance.

04:41.490 --> 04:45.786
Did you listen to records with Lin,
after he came to rescue you?

04:47.955 --> 04:49.456
What else did you do?

04:51.458 --> 04:53.043
What is this? Are you jealous?

04:55.337 --> 04:56.797
Of who? Me and Lin?

04:58.549 --> 05:00.342
I'm jealous of you and everyone.

05:00.425 --> 05:03.512
Lin's only got eyes for Karla. Trust me.

05:05.556 --> 05:09.726
I liked it when you defended me tonight.
"She doesn't do that anymore."

05:11.436 --> 05:15.107
You know, when you said it,
it's the first time I realized it's true.

05:29.204 --> 05:30.414
Take me to bed.

05:37.129 --> 05:38.881
I mean, look, you can't blame them.

05:38.964 --> 05:40.924
The whole system acts
like they don't exist.

05:41.008 --> 05:44.052
You know, even the doctors
at the public hospitals want baksheesh.

05:44.136 --> 05:45.345
It's fucking bullshit.

05:45.929 --> 05:49.391
These poor people,
they just come home and die,

05:50.851 --> 05:52.603
unless I do something about it.

05:54.146 --> 05:56.231
I got a hookup
for black market medical supplies.

05:56.315 --> 05:58.066
Now my hut looks like a bloody pharmacy.

05:58.150 --> 05:59.526
I'm not joking.

05:59.610 --> 06:01.820
Give me one more week,
I'm gonna have my own ambulance.

06:01.904 --> 06:03.989
Sagar Wada Ambulance Company.

06:05.616 --> 06:07.826
Lin, your face is a picture

06:07.910 --> 06:12.497
of idealistic outrage so perfect

06:12.581 --> 06:15.167
I want to commit it to memory.

06:15.250 --> 06:19.004
Such a thing is so rare here,
it should be preserved.

06:19.588 --> 06:22.716
Arre, we thought you had gone
straight to Varanasi to smoke charas.

06:22.799 --> 06:26.261
But you are here only, saving lives
and shitting into the bay.

06:26.345 --> 06:29.306
-It's just what I do.
-It's an incredible story.

06:29.389 --> 06:31.141
Have you ever heard anything like this?

06:31.683 --> 06:32.935
Can't say I have.

06:34.436 --> 06:36.396
It's a pretty amazing thing
you're doing, Lin.

06:36.480 --> 06:38.482
Nah, I was just there, you know?

06:40.901 --> 06:43.612
Drunk on whiskey
and visions of my own redemption,

06:43.695 --> 06:45.322
I'd forgotten what I really was.

06:45.989 --> 06:48.325
A fugitive who needed to stay invisible.

06:57.417 --> 07:00.337
-Linbaba!
-Linbaba!

07:04.049 --> 07:05.509
Dr. Lin!

07:05.592 --> 07:07.386
Good morning!

07:07.469 --> 07:09.304
Come out, Linbaba!

07:13.600 --> 07:16.186
Good morning!

07:16.270 --> 07:18.021
Come out, Linbaba!

07:19.523 --> 07:21.900
Come out, Linbaba!

07:21.984 --> 07:24.820
Okay! Okay, I'm coming.

07:30.158 --> 07:32.202
Linbaba, you are awake, finally.

07:33.787 --> 07:38.542
Very good, very good.
Today is ration day. Take.

07:39.585 --> 07:41.128
Linbaba, take, take.

07:43.839 --> 07:45.340
Oh, man--

07:45.424 --> 07:50.596
As citizens, Mr. Lin, us bastiwale,
we still have some rights.

07:50.679 --> 07:55.350
The right to vote, the right to rations,
and, of course, the right to pay taxes.

07:56.518 --> 08:00.272
But, Linbaba, you are true not-person,
so you are not getting any of this, huh?

08:00.355 --> 08:02.983
But we do not want any charity.
You're one of us now.

08:03.942 --> 08:07.738
And then when we collect our rations,
so will the doctor, huh?

08:09.698 --> 08:11.074
Thank you, thank you.

08:13.160 --> 08:14.703
Arre, give more.

08:14.786 --> 08:16.955
-Oh, no. No.
-You can take, na?

08:17.039 --> 08:18.415
You can take anything else you want.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.125
-Thank you.
-Potatoes, rice.

08:20.209 --> 08:21.752
We'll send a cup of tea for you.

08:25.339 --> 08:30.052
Lin's an outsider. Saving lives.
I think it could be a really good story.

08:30.135 --> 08:32.221
I think you should pitch it
to your editor.

08:32.304 --> 08:35.599
So what's the headline?
"Gora tourist arrives with Band-Aids"?

08:35.682 --> 08:39.186
Headline is,
"Shut up, Nishant, and get serious,

08:39.269 --> 08:42.606
-or I'll take this story somewhere else."
-Touchy. Okay, sorry.

08:42.688 --> 08:43.857
He works for free

08:43.941 --> 08:47.069
and gets absolutely no support
from the medical community.

08:47.152 --> 08:49.863
He's shaming a system
that deserves shaming.

08:49.947 --> 08:51.823
You're pitching this gora slum doctor
as a feature?

08:51.907 --> 08:55.661
Yes. Something that gets attention
and causes some change.

08:57.746 --> 09:03.210
I'm sick of smiling and flirting
for puff-piece profiles on movie stars.

09:03.293 --> 09:05.879
-They're good business, yaar.
-They're not journalism, yaar.

09:05.963 --> 09:08.590
-Not what I want to do.
-So ambitious.

09:11.802 --> 09:12.928
Is that a problem?

09:14.054 --> 09:16.682
Am I getting ideas
above my station, Nishant?

09:16.765 --> 09:19.601
Should I be busy having babies
instead maybe?

09:19.685 --> 09:20.686
Yes.

09:20.769 --> 09:22.104
What? I should be having b--

09:22.187 --> 09:24.857
Yes, it could appeal to my editor.
I'll talk to him.

09:28.068 --> 09:30.070
But it will be strictly a freelance.

09:30.571 --> 09:33.115
So to be clear,
I'm not offering you a job at the paper.

09:34.616 --> 09:36.076
I would not be your boss.

09:36.159 --> 09:38.954
And by your rules,
we still could have dinner.

09:41.790 --> 09:43.000
And what if I say no?

09:45.127 --> 09:47.254
I'll still bring him the story,
but let the record show

09:47.337 --> 09:50.090
that I think having something in common,
like a profession,

09:50.174 --> 09:54.052
should be a prima facie incentive
for dating, not a deterrent.

09:58.849 --> 10:01.101
Fine. Dinner.

10:02.102 --> 10:04.271
Evening of my convenience.

10:04.354 --> 10:06.064
Is tomorrow night convenient?

10:18.202 --> 10:19.494
Would you like a drink?

10:44.978 --> 10:46.063
Excuse me.

10:52.402 --> 10:53.654
Minister Pandey.

10:56.198 --> 10:57.658
My congratulations.

10:58.283 --> 10:59.493
Thank you, madam.

11:01.203 --> 11:04.081
I wanted to introduce myself.
Abdel Khader Khan.

11:04.790 --> 11:06.458
A pleasure. Of course.

11:06.542 --> 11:11.755
Minister Pandey, your predecessor
was a great loss to me. A great loss.

11:12.798 --> 11:13.799
A tragedy.

11:13.882 --> 11:16.760
I had been a patron
of his political career for many years

11:16.844 --> 11:19.847
because I was certain
of his desire to do the right thing

11:19.930 --> 11:21.181
by the people of Colaba.

11:21.265 --> 11:24.810
To act in the best interests of the many,
not the few.

11:25.644 --> 11:29.106
Of course.
We serve at the pleasure of the people.

11:29.189 --> 11:32.276
And the pleasure of the people
can change on a whim.

11:34.027 --> 11:36.321
The perils of being a politician.

11:36.405 --> 11:38.991
You only wield as much power
as the people give you.

11:39.575 --> 11:42.160
And what they give you,
they can take away.

11:42.244 --> 11:45.205
Yes, put your faith in the slum.

11:46.331 --> 11:47.749
Thank you for coming.

11:47.833 --> 11:50.669
I was keen to meet you face-to-face.

11:50.752 --> 11:51.962
Until next time.

11:52.045 --> 11:53.297
He is bought and sold.

11:54.006 --> 11:56.133
I expected Miss Karla
to have delivered that message.

11:56.216 --> 12:00.179
She did. But I wanted to deliver
the minister a different message.

12:00.262 --> 12:02.890
And so you threaten him with what?
The votes of Sagar Wada?

12:02.973 --> 12:06.059
You think you can win the will
of the people with your pet doctor?

12:06.560 --> 12:08.353
I expected more from you, Khaderbhai.

12:08.437 --> 12:11.523
This is India, where dharma is king.

12:11.607 --> 12:12.941
And you and I both know

12:13.025 --> 12:16.612
the people of Sagar Wada will be given
a say in their own fate.

12:16.695 --> 12:20.657
Delivering votes means nothing
if I own the office that counts them.

12:35.422 --> 12:37.132
A friend is asking for you.

12:38.175 --> 12:39.259
No one knows why.

12:41.512 --> 12:42.513
I don't like it.

12:46.225 --> 12:47.518
That's right, brother.

12:48.101 --> 12:50.854
Direct from the factory.
None of this hand-me-down shit.

12:50.938 --> 12:52.481
What are you talking about?

12:52.564 --> 12:53.690
She's for you.

12:53.774 --> 12:55.817
He bought it for Dr. Lin!

12:57.069 --> 12:58.403
He's Khader's man.

12:59.279 --> 13:00.531
Mate, I can't take this.

13:00.614 --> 13:01.698
A goonda.

13:01.782 --> 13:04.576
Are we not brothers?
Have we not saved each other's lives?

13:06.828 --> 13:07.913
Can you not ride?

13:10.290 --> 13:11.291
I can ride.

13:12.835 --> 13:15.170
I'm beginning to think
it's because you're scared.

13:15.254 --> 13:18.048
Even the kid can tell.
Hey, what do you think, boy? Is he scared?

13:18.131 --> 13:19.132
Yes.

13:21.260 --> 13:23.178
You must take this bike, Lin.

13:23.846 --> 13:27.391
I have better things to do with my time
than be your medicine delivery boy.

13:27.891 --> 13:31.353
You see? Accepting is your gift to me.

13:42.155 --> 13:43.574
What do you think, Ravi?

13:59.756 --> 14:01.341
Test drive?

14:02.885 --> 14:04.261
You wanna come, Ravi?

14:46.220 --> 14:48.680
You haven't said a word since we left.

14:50.390 --> 14:53.727
Why do you want Walid to think
Lin Ford is part of your plan?

14:53.810 --> 14:57.231
Well, when you pick a man's pocket,
it's important to have a distraction.

14:58.106 --> 15:00.108
Was that your plan for him all along?

15:00.192 --> 15:03.946
Who am I that I could manipulate
fate and consequence so thoroughly? God?

15:04.446 --> 15:08.951
No. Lin is in Sagar Wada
for his own reasons.

15:09.034 --> 15:12.412
Our agreement
is purely the business of medicine.

15:12.496 --> 15:16.166
Lin would not be there if not for us,
what I made him do.

15:17.125 --> 15:20.879
Zhou sent a killer into Sagar Wada
after him, and they started the fire.

15:20.963 --> 15:23.841
Someone died. Lin blames himself for that.

15:25.926 --> 15:27.886
He shared all this with you?

15:29.096 --> 15:35.269
Not a casual conversation
with a man you care nothing for.

15:37.145 --> 15:38.856
What else did you speak about?

15:38.939 --> 15:40.148
Nothing important.

15:42.109 --> 15:45.195
You went to Lin to see if he would
tell you more about his time with me

15:45.279 --> 15:46.363
than I did.

15:50.367 --> 15:52.119
-Did he?
-No.

15:54.663 --> 15:58.166
Do you want for us to tell him the truth
about how we are all connected?

15:58.750 --> 16:00.252
It's already too late for that.

16:01.587 --> 16:03.589
I just don't want
anybody else getting hurt.

16:04.339 --> 16:06.300
I am happy to agree

16:07.426 --> 16:11.930
that neither of us will interfere
with Lin's path any further, if you are.

16:12.973 --> 16:15.184
If he chooses to stay in Sagar Wada,
so what?

16:16.435 --> 16:19.855
Otherwise, we both stay away.

16:40.250 --> 16:43.295
I don't think that fellow over there
likes you very much.

16:43.378 --> 16:44.588
Or he likes you too much.

16:45.297 --> 16:46.465
Yeah, he's a prick.

16:48.258 --> 16:52.221
And this boy, Ravi,
I'm very sure he also doesn't like you.

16:52.304 --> 16:56.141
Is that why you do all this doctoring
in the slum? So people will like you?

16:57.184 --> 16:59.686
A little goes a long way
to making people happy there.

17:00.729 --> 17:02.231
What will make you happy, Lin?

17:04.148 --> 17:05.317
That's a long list.

17:07.194 --> 17:10.071
If I could actually work out Karla,
that would be something.

17:10.155 --> 17:11.073
Karla?

17:11.156 --> 17:13.825
The woman who came up to us
at the club the other night.

17:14.660 --> 17:15.868
What's your story with her?

17:17.287 --> 17:18.579
You tell me, mate.

17:18.664 --> 17:21.959
That woman is a mystery tied in a riddle,
wrapped in an enigma.

17:23.252 --> 17:26.255
She pushes me away, then pulls me close.

17:26.338 --> 17:29.258
Ignores me, then tells me,
"Don't be a stranger."

17:30.259 --> 17:32.052
What am I supposed to do with that?

17:32.803 --> 17:34.555
I would say don't be a stranger.

17:35.556 --> 17:37.683
-Simple? Just that simple?
-Just like that.

17:38.600 --> 17:39.893
Nice.

17:40.894 --> 17:42.855
Maurizio, mate,
how did it go at the VD clinic?

17:42.938 --> 17:44.565
Did you get everything cleared up?

17:45.440 --> 17:47.276
Antibiotics are a wonderful thing.

17:53.532 --> 17:56.034
Strange to me
why anyone could dislike you.

18:03.333 --> 18:04.418
Relax.

18:04.501 --> 18:08.088
They can't do anything in here.
That's why they're being so brave.

18:18.473 --> 18:19.766
It's Rafiq, right?

18:21.101 --> 18:22.895
Listen, about the other day,

18:22.978 --> 18:25.272
I can see why you might be
pissed off about that,

18:25.355 --> 18:28.400
how you might want
a little bit of payback or whatever.

18:28.483 --> 18:30.444
But, look, I'm Switzerland.

18:31.945 --> 18:34.615
I'm just a fella that couldn't let
two other fellas kill each other

18:34.698 --> 18:35.699
in broad daylight.

18:35.782 --> 18:38.327
That's all. No hard feelings, yeah?

18:49.379 --> 18:52.716
I saved your life.
If I wasn't there, you wouldn't be here.

18:52.799 --> 18:54.968
No, he wouldn't.

18:58.222 --> 19:00.849
You should leave Bombay
before something bad happens.

19:01.975 --> 19:03.602
Yeah, so people keep telling me.

19:04.228 --> 19:07.272
Listen, I'm serious.
I don't want any trouble with you.

19:08.357 --> 19:12.110
Too late. You chose a side, doctor man.

19:13.946 --> 19:14.988
The wrong one.

19:20.369 --> 19:21.370
All right.

19:23.121 --> 19:24.331
We're leaving.

19:24.414 --> 19:25.832
But I don't want to go.

19:25.916 --> 19:27.876
Unless you wanna walk home, move.

19:33.257 --> 19:34.341
Are you staying?

19:36.802 --> 19:39.596
You know me. I want seconds.

19:40.222 --> 19:41.223
Be careful.

20:17.968 --> 20:20.220
Hey, how you going, Jitendra, Ratna?

20:20.762 --> 20:21.763
Ravi?

20:23.182 --> 20:25.350
-Did you finish your chores?
-What chores?

20:26.310 --> 20:28.061
Ravi, now.

20:28.145 --> 20:30.856
Yes, sir. I'm going.

20:34.610 --> 20:35.777
Can we speak?

20:35.861 --> 20:38.071
Sure. Sure, come in.

20:43.619 --> 20:44.745
You wanna sit down?

20:44.828 --> 20:48.582
Oh, no. I just took up this collection.

20:49.791 --> 20:53.170
What for? You already gave me too much.

20:53.253 --> 20:56.757
No, Mr. Lin. That is our payment
for the work you do.

20:57.549 --> 21:02.679
This money,
this is for the supplies you must buy.

21:04.515 --> 21:05.516
Okay.

21:07.476 --> 21:08.685
Look, Mr. Lin,

21:09.478 --> 21:13.190
where you get your medicine from
is your business.

21:13.273 --> 21:16.109
But the people here,
we need to pay our own way.

21:18.028 --> 21:19.655
I see you talking to Khader's man.

21:20.405 --> 21:22.241
I hear him call you "brother."

21:23.867 --> 21:25.786
That is not the kind of brother you need.

21:26.537 --> 21:29.706
Brotherhood is right here,
in the jhopadpatti.

21:32.042 --> 21:34.503
And there will be conflict
in having two brothers.

21:42.594 --> 21:44.096
We do not have much here,

21:44.847 --> 21:46.515
but we also owe nothing.

21:47.099 --> 21:48.600
And that is our strength.

21:50.561 --> 21:53.397
The cost of your medicines
should be our burden, Mr. Lin,

21:54.231 --> 21:59.152
so it doesn't become our debt
to you or anyone else.

22:02.781 --> 22:03.782
Okay.

22:04.283 --> 22:05.492
Salaam alaikum.

22:05.576 --> 22:06.785
Alaikumu assalam.

22:08.912 --> 22:10.455
I knew he was right

22:11.039 --> 22:13.166
and that if I wanted to stay
in this place,

22:13.667 --> 22:15.210
it had to be by their rules.

22:20.090 --> 22:22.009
I fund this school.

22:24.678 --> 22:27.181
None of the children here have parents.

22:33.228 --> 22:35.314
I cannot deny how I make my money,

22:35.397 --> 22:37.733
but does that matter
as much as what I do with it?

22:38.817 --> 22:40.819
The courts and the police would say yeah.

22:40.903 --> 22:44.740
Now, that is because our laws concentrate
on how much crime is in the sin.

22:44.823 --> 22:47.534
For me, the important thing is
how much sin is in the crime.

22:48.118 --> 22:50.537
I do not make money
from prostitution, drugs.

22:50.621 --> 22:52.456
I do not traffic children, women.

22:53.040 --> 22:56.752
All the other councils, they do,
and that puts me at a disadvantage.

22:56.835 --> 23:01.381
So instead of investing in sin,
I must invest in people,

23:01.882 --> 23:05.469
help them grow and maybe, at some point,
I will reap the benefits.

23:05.552 --> 23:07.638
So I'm one of these seeds you planted.

23:08.889 --> 23:10.933
Are you getting the benefit you hoped for?

23:13.393 --> 23:17.564
It makes me sad
that this is where we are, you and I.

23:18.357 --> 23:22.444
You are very different.
I think you know this.

23:23.612 --> 23:26.990
I have no children, but in this world,
you are a daughter to me,

23:27.074 --> 23:28.325
if you choose to be,

23:28.408 --> 23:31.495
although I will never pretend to be
the kind of father a daughter needs.

23:32.246 --> 23:34.414
You've given me
more than my own father did.

23:37.501 --> 23:38.752
I'm so sorry.

23:40.504 --> 23:44.341
When I first met Rujul,
he wanted to make Bombay a better place.

23:44.842 --> 23:46.468
But power and money changed him.

23:46.552 --> 23:49.346
I didn't see it
until you brought it to me.

23:50.597 --> 23:53.267
But now I worry
that you regret doing that.

23:53.976 --> 23:56.019
I feel like I'm in over my head.

23:56.103 --> 23:58.772
I have no control. I don't like it.

23:58.856 --> 24:00.607
That's why you must always ask yourself

24:00.691 --> 24:04.361
how much sin is in the crime for you,
no one else.

24:05.195 --> 24:07.406
And if it becomes too much
for your soul to bear,

24:07.489 --> 24:09.157
then you must walk away.

24:09.658 --> 24:12.536
You, me, Abdullah, even Lin Ford,
are driven by

24:12.619 --> 24:14.538
a death we would change if we could.

24:15.163 --> 24:17.624
And that starting point
is burned into our hearts

24:17.708 --> 24:19.418
and cannot be reasoned away.

24:19.501 --> 24:22.296
Then our paths are set.
We can't change it--

24:22.379 --> 24:23.922
No, no, no. We can. We must.

24:24.882 --> 24:27.885
I love you, Karla,
whether it is my right or not.

24:27.968 --> 24:29.761
So I will say it again.

24:31.096 --> 24:33.140
If you want to choose a different path,

24:34.224 --> 24:36.226
it will not affect our relationship.

24:52.242 --> 24:53.410
Help me with this.

25:08.759 --> 25:11.094
I will cover the parts you have looked at.

25:16.517 --> 25:19.853
She'll have to stay here tonight
until this IV is finished.

25:19.937 --> 25:23.232
She would not want this.
Not alone with you.

25:24.733 --> 25:25.776
I know.

25:26.276 --> 25:28.403
That's why
you're gonna have to stay with her.

25:29.446 --> 25:30.656
I'll go to Prabhu.

25:34.701 --> 25:36.161
You're good at this, Parvati.

25:39.748 --> 25:43.335
I think I would like to do this
as a real job.

25:45.546 --> 25:48.715
Yeah, they always need good people.
You should pursue it.

25:48.799 --> 25:51.635
Not easy for a girl from here.

26:09.653 --> 26:12.322
Kavita, what are you doing here?

26:12.406 --> 26:15.200
Everything you were talking about
the other night got me thinking

26:15.284 --> 26:16.577
about how I could help.

26:16.660 --> 26:17.661
Help with what?

26:17.744 --> 26:20.789
Your medical work here,
the fight you're taking on.

26:20.873 --> 26:23.083
What you're doing
will get a lot of attention.

26:23.166 --> 26:26.295
The fact you have to do it
because no one else wants to.

26:26.378 --> 26:29.423
Lin, I think what you're doing is amazing,

26:29.506 --> 26:32.676
but real change needs political will.

26:32.759 --> 26:37.014
The easiest way to get that
is by putting you on the front page.

26:37.681 --> 26:39.099
No. No way.

26:40.017 --> 26:41.268
Fuck that.

26:42.019 --> 26:44.438
I can't, Kavita. I'm sorry.

26:44.521 --> 26:47.107
How about I talk
to some of the patients, you know?

26:47.191 --> 26:48.859
Get some pictures of you at work.

26:50.194 --> 26:52.779
-Hey!
-There is no story, all right?

26:52.863 --> 26:54.239
You're gonna ruin everything.

26:54.823 --> 26:56.158
What the fuck, man?

26:59.453 --> 27:00.537
Am I clear?

27:01.205 --> 27:02.998
Be clearer if you told me why.

27:07.169 --> 27:08.962
Why don't you want this story told?

27:13.509 --> 27:15.469
It's nothing. Really. I'm--

27:17.304 --> 27:19.181
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have done that.

27:19.765 --> 27:22.309
If there's any damage, I'll pay--

27:22.893 --> 27:24.895
-Don't worry about it.
-No, Kavita.

27:26.271 --> 27:27.314
Kavita.

27:30.150 --> 27:34.196
My heart was pounding
as I realized how fragile my freedom was.

27:34.279 --> 27:37.991
Just one photograph out in the world
could send me straight back to prison.

27:46.750 --> 27:47.793
Parvati.

27:52.965 --> 27:54.508
Pa…

27:58.262 --> 28:01.348
Parvati, oh, Parvati,

28:01.431 --> 28:06.478
oh, meri Parvati.

28:06.562 --> 28:07.563
Hey.

28:10.732 --> 28:13.610
Please do not ruin my happy thoughts, huh?

28:14.611 --> 28:16.154
Your face is very…

28:17.531 --> 28:19.741
Children will cry
if they look at this face.

28:21.577 --> 28:23.495
It's been a bit of a day, Prabhu, mate.

28:25.289 --> 28:27.833
Seems I can't get things right
for getting them wrong.

28:38.302 --> 28:40.345
I love her too much, Linbaba.

28:41.597 --> 28:43.098
You're making me jealous.

28:44.183 --> 28:48.812
Yeah, well, I am jealous of that big, fat
envelope of money Qasimbhai is giving you.

28:49.438 --> 28:50.522
I'm sick about it.

28:53.275 --> 28:56.695
Okay. Then, to feel better about it,

28:56.778 --> 29:00.949
why don't you, you know, roll around
on your big bed of money, Linbaba?

29:01.658 --> 29:03.911
Prabhu, the whole jhopadpatti
has been chipping in

29:03.994 --> 29:06.788
'cause they think I'm spending my money
on the medicine.

29:06.872 --> 29:07.998
If not you, then who?

29:09.875 --> 29:11.126
Khaderbhai's been paying.

29:15.464 --> 29:17.925
Okay, very bad. Very bad, very--

29:18.008 --> 29:20.928
Lin, you must never tell anyone,

29:21.512 --> 29:23.514
or Qasimbhai will tell you
to leave Sagar Wada.

29:23.597 --> 29:25.724
Look, that money should go
back to the people.

29:25.807 --> 29:27.601
No.

29:28.393 --> 29:30.270
That will only get you in more trouble.

29:30.354 --> 29:33.982
The people love you, they need you,
they want you to have it. Please, Linbaba.

29:34.900 --> 29:39.571
Just keep your head down
and money in your pocket, boss.

29:42.449 --> 29:45.327
-It's a lie.
-Not a lie. Just a…

29:46.286 --> 29:48.080
-Not telling.
-Not telling.

29:48.705 --> 29:50.624
With consequences you must deal with.

29:50.707 --> 29:54.461
And the consequences are
everyone stays happy,

29:55.087 --> 29:59.424
and you must live with too much money.

30:13.564 --> 30:15.607
Why don't you take some of that food
to Parvati

30:17.317 --> 30:18.735
and say hello?

30:18.819 --> 30:22.948
Please, Lin. Her family do not need
any more reason to hate me.

30:23.031 --> 30:25.951
An unmarried woman
cannot be talking to a--

30:27.578 --> 30:33.542
handsome, unmarried fellow like me,
alone in the beautiful dark of the night.

30:36.879 --> 30:38.797
Same reason you are sleeping here tonight.

30:40.382 --> 30:41.842
So many rules.

30:43.051 --> 30:47.264
Can't be alone with another man's wife
or with a woman who's nobody's wife

30:47.764 --> 30:49.433
or with any woman, pretty much.

30:50.100 --> 30:51.852
I'm surprised
there are so many kids around here.

30:53.478 --> 30:56.565
I'm not saying spend the night.
Just go say hello.

31:00.402 --> 31:02.487
It is not possible, Linbaba.

31:07.868 --> 31:13.123
Parvati is alone, and I cannot be with her
even though I desire her very much.

31:15.792 --> 31:18.295
Instead, I'm sharing my tiny hut with you.

31:19.922 --> 31:24.134
But Karla Ma'am is alone,
and there are no rules stopping you.

31:24.718 --> 31:26.178
And you are jealous of me?

31:28.263 --> 31:30.974
I am the one
who cannot have sexy time tonight

31:31.058 --> 31:32.309
because of this situation.

31:36.396 --> 31:37.397
Now I'm confused.

31:37.481 --> 31:41.693
Are you telling me to go get laid
or do you wanna be alone to masturbate?

31:43.195 --> 31:47.324
All friends here, Linbaba.
I don't mind if I'm alone or not.

31:53.121 --> 31:55.415
Then I definitely have
somewhere else to be.

32:11.807 --> 32:13.350
Lin Ford at the gate, sir.

32:13.851 --> 32:15.018
You should leave.

32:16.061 --> 32:17.813
Don't let Lin see you.

32:20.524 --> 32:21.817
We'll finish this later.

32:40.460 --> 32:41.545
Khaderbhai.

32:42.713 --> 32:47.259
-Do you play?
-No, I have no idea what that is.

32:47.759 --> 32:49.720
Pachisi. I will teach you.

32:49.803 --> 32:51.138
Some other time maybe.

32:53.599 --> 32:56.268
Look, everything you've done
has been appreciated, Khaderbhai,

32:56.351 --> 32:59.479
but I'm gonna have to insist on
paying you back.

33:00.731 --> 33:02.691
Paying my own way from now on.

33:04.776 --> 33:06.945
Did someone send you here to tell me this?

33:07.029 --> 33:09.198
No. No, they didn't need to.

33:09.823 --> 33:11.158
Sagar Wada has its own rules,

33:11.241 --> 33:13.827
and if I'm gonna live there,
they have to be my rules too.

33:13.911 --> 33:16.580
What rule do they have
except to grovel and wallow in shit?

33:17.164 --> 33:19.625
Their only rule is
that they're happy to suffer.

33:19.708 --> 33:21.752
There's more than one kind of suffering,
Abdullah.

33:21.835 --> 33:24.213
The one we feel
and the one we cause others to feel.

33:24.296 --> 33:26.757
You don't have to suffer anything
if you're strong enough to deny it.

33:26.840 --> 33:29.885
Well, maybe true strength is suffering
for others when you don't have to.

33:29.968 --> 33:33.013
Mr. Lin came here to make his life harder.
Do you think him weak?

33:33.597 --> 33:35.766
No. But though I count him as a brother,

33:35.849 --> 33:38.060
he's a crazy Westerner,
and the rules don't count for him.

33:38.143 --> 33:40.187
A suffering can be a kind of anger.

33:40.270 --> 33:43.106
We rage against injustice and unfairness,

33:43.190 --> 33:45.776
and some men feel compelled
to bear this suffering

33:45.859 --> 33:47.486
no matter the consequences.

33:48.028 --> 33:50.864
Such a man is only truly happy
when he is suffering for others.

33:50.948 --> 33:52.574
The hero's curse.

33:53.825 --> 33:56.620
You've done it now.
This discussion will last a long time.

33:56.703 --> 33:58.205
Better you take the money and go.

33:58.705 --> 34:00.082
I'm afraid I can't do that.

34:02.960 --> 34:05.003
And I respect your decision.

34:05.879 --> 34:08.841
My interest is only in being a help to you
in Sagar Wada.

34:08.924 --> 34:12.678
And if I can ever be a help to you again,
my door is always open.

34:13.262 --> 34:16.431
-Thank you, Khaderbhai.
-I enjoy our conversations, Lin.

34:16.514 --> 34:18.934
I hope we can maintain
our friendship at least.

34:19.768 --> 34:21.186
Nothing I'd like more.

34:21.270 --> 34:22.271
Good.

34:41.831 --> 34:43.625
My saab will be coming soon.

35:16.116 --> 35:17.117
Lindsay.

35:47.773 --> 35:50.817
Did you know that
it's practically illegal in the Sagar Wada

35:50.901 --> 35:54.446
for a man to be alone with
an unmarried woman in the dead of night?

36:02.704 --> 36:03.997
What are you doing here?

36:07.835 --> 36:09.127
I missed you.

36:23.433 --> 36:24.768
Why did you let me in?

36:40.367 --> 36:42.077
Come inside.

36:43.745 --> 36:46.540
Let's go. I've come to take you home.

36:47.749 --> 36:50.002
I can't leave her tonight.

36:50.669 --> 36:56.258
This is not your job.
The shop is your business.

36:57.801 --> 37:01.221
There is only one road
out of our difficulties, Parvati!

37:02.806 --> 37:04.141
Parvati.

37:04.224 --> 37:06.727
Everything you're doing for the clinic…

37:06.810 --> 37:09.938
is at the expense
of your own flesh and blood.

37:10.022 --> 37:15.777
I don't do this for the clinic.
I do this for me.

37:29.291 --> 37:31.210
I'm getting the Lewis Carrolls.

37:31.293 --> 37:34.171
"Oh, you're mad. Bonkers.

37:34.254 --> 37:35.506
Completely off your head.

37:36.673 --> 37:41.136
But I'll tell you a secret.
All the best people are."

37:41.720 --> 37:45.015
Very good, Lin. Too smart by half.

37:48.769 --> 37:52.689
Is you being here going to make
one of those pretty slum girls jealous?

37:53.941 --> 37:55.108
What?

37:55.901 --> 37:57.110
No.

37:58.403 --> 38:00.864
I should stop listening to Didier.

38:00.948 --> 38:03.575
Thinks the only reason
you would stay in a slum is sex.

38:04.451 --> 38:06.912
What, not even love? Just sex?

38:08.372 --> 38:09.456
I hate love.

38:13.710 --> 38:15.838
You can't hate love, Karla.

38:15.921 --> 38:17.256
Why not?

38:17.339 --> 38:20.926
It's such an arrogance to love someone
and to expect it in return.

38:22.636 --> 38:26.598
I think heaven is a place
where everybody is happy

38:26.682 --> 38:29.685
because nobody has to love
anyone else ever again.

38:33.814 --> 38:35.357
So if love's no good…

38:37.609 --> 38:39.194
what is?

38:39.278 --> 38:43.115
Power. It's the opposite of love.

38:44.533 --> 38:45.993
You're a fucking savage.

38:55.586 --> 38:59.673
So, why are you here in Bombay
in the first place?

39:03.302 --> 39:04.678
The original sin.

39:11.476 --> 39:13.854
I'll show you mine if you show me yours.

39:14.563 --> 39:15.772
Then don't tell me.

39:16.732 --> 39:18.025
Maybe I wanna tell you.

39:21.236 --> 39:23.113
Maybe I wanna tell someone the truth.

39:24.781 --> 39:26.241
Someone I trust.

39:27.910 --> 39:29.953
Someone I think could be a friend.

39:33.582 --> 39:34.750
Are we friends?

39:36.251 --> 39:39.129
I let you in, against my better judgment.

40:12.037 --> 40:13.413
I was addicted to heroin.

40:17.376 --> 40:20.712
I needed money, so I robbed a bank.

40:22.840 --> 40:24.007
A cop got killed,

40:25.342 --> 40:28.178
not by me, but I played my part.

40:30.931 --> 40:32.266
And they put me away.

40:35.352 --> 40:36.937
And then I escaped…

40:39.314 --> 40:42.484
and ran as fast
and as hard as I could to here.

40:46.864 --> 40:47.906
Why here?

40:49.658 --> 40:50.951
I always wanted to come.

40:52.160 --> 40:54.121
It's what the money
was supposed to be for.

40:56.498 --> 40:59.084
So I convinced myself I could come anyway.

41:01.170 --> 41:03.088
Leave all the rest behind.

41:09.887 --> 41:12.181
Take that information
to any cop in Bombay.

41:12.264 --> 41:13.765
There's probably a reward in it.

41:20.814 --> 41:22.441
So now we have to be friends.

41:24.610 --> 41:26.153
My life is in your hands.

41:36.038 --> 41:37.414
Don't. Don't.

41:41.793 --> 41:44.004
Is this St. Hilda's Hospital, Bombay?

41:44.087 --> 41:45.255
This is St. Hilda's.

41:45.339 --> 41:47.216
-Is this Usha?
-Yes.

41:47.299 --> 41:50.010
It's Susan Reeves
from the passport office in Auckland.

41:50.093 --> 41:53.055
I ran the passport number.
You're sure you gave me the right one?

41:54.640 --> 41:59.061
R 22624-788. Lindsay Ford.

41:59.978 --> 42:03.023
He's still in a coma,
and it doesn't look good.

42:03.524 --> 42:07.152
The least we can do is find his family
and tell them he's not coming home.

42:07.236 --> 42:10.572
I'm sure they know, love.
Lindsay Ford's been dead for six years.

42:11.240 --> 42:14.701
If you don't mind holding a minute,
my supervisor would like a word.

42:14.785 --> 42:15.827
Of course.

42:21.500 --> 42:24.086
He's using a dead man's passport.

42:53.282 --> 42:57.494
When I was 12, my father shot himself.

42:59.204 --> 43:00.289
I found him.

43:02.040 --> 43:04.793
Brains all over
a pile of bankruptcy forms.

43:08.005 --> 43:11.425
I grew up rich, certain of two things.

43:13.010 --> 43:17.389
I wanted for nothing,
and my father loved me more than anything.

43:20.100 --> 43:23.187
Turned out I was wrong on both counts.

43:25.606 --> 43:28.984
And during everything that came after,
the thing I could never get past

43:30.527 --> 43:33.322
was why wasn't I enough
for him to live for?

43:38.785 --> 43:40.913
I was complacent in my love for him

43:42.247 --> 43:44.666
and in my assumption
that he loved me most.

43:46.293 --> 43:47.336
He didn't.

43:48.128 --> 43:51.632
He loved who and what he was
and what people thought of him.

43:54.510 --> 43:55.928
I used to cry myself to sleep

43:56.011 --> 43:59.223
at whatever relative's house
I'd been shunted to,

44:00.432 --> 44:02.684
and ask why he couldn't have
just stayed for me…

44:05.103 --> 44:07.356
he couldn't have just loved me
and that be enough?

44:12.611 --> 44:13.987
That wasn't your fault.

44:14.821 --> 44:18.492
I know that. Guilt's your thing, not mine.

44:21.370 --> 44:25.541
I blamed him for throwing my love away.

44:28.001 --> 44:29.628
And blame's harder than guilt.

44:32.130 --> 44:33.757
And also easier.

44:35.968 --> 44:38.929
If you assume the worst of everyone,
it's easy not to get close.

44:41.807 --> 44:43.976
You asked what I want.

44:44.059 --> 44:47.354
I never wanna be dependent
on anybody else again.

44:48.230 --> 44:49.731
That's it.

44:52.526 --> 44:53.610
Sounds lonely.

44:57.948 --> 45:03.245
"They fuck you up, your mom and dad.
They may not mean to, but they do."

45:04.538 --> 45:06.874
"They fill you with the faults they had."

45:06.957 --> 45:09.668
-"And add some extra, just for you."
-"And add some extra, just for you."

45:16.466 --> 45:19.553
You know, last time
I was out after curfew with you…

45:21.638 --> 45:23.098
I got chased by the cops.

45:25.517 --> 45:28.729
Then I guess you better stay,
if you'd like.

45:59.593 --> 46:00.636
I can't.

46:02.262 --> 46:03.305
You could.

46:05.807 --> 46:07.226
It's not that simple.

46:19.321 --> 46:20.697
The couch is all yours.
