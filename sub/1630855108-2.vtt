WEBVTT

02:23.268 --> 02:24.561
- Candy?
- Yeah?

02:26.312 --> 02:28.815
I'm due back at work soon.

02:28.815 --> 02:29.732
Sure. Come on in.

02:32.694 --> 02:34.320
Well, I think under the circumstances,

02:34.320 --> 02:36.489
God won't bat an eye at us
showering together.

02:39.617 --> 02:41.077
Probably not.

02:46.666 --> 02:49.127
- Is there enough room?
- Oh yeah, plenty.

02:49.127 --> 02:51.504
Are you sure? 'Cause I--

02:51.504 --> 02:56.509
No, we're fine. See?
It's not the best water pressure, but...

03:05.894 --> 03:07.061
Allan.

03:10.356 --> 03:11.316
Thank you.

03:12.650 --> 03:13.860
For what?

03:15.069 --> 03:17.030
Just thank you.

04:44.325 --> 04:46.619
Oh, my dear heaven.

04:48.454 --> 04:51.624
The idea that this may be the last day
I listen to that choir.

04:53.126 --> 04:54.043
Well.

04:55.086 --> 04:57.171
It's not gonna be the last time.
Simple as that.

04:58.089 --> 05:01.217
I may not be your minister going forward,

05:01.217 --> 05:04.262
but I want you all to know
that you are in good hands.

05:04.262 --> 05:06.806
My replacement, Pastor Ron Adams.

05:06.806 --> 05:08.349
Stand up, Ron.

05:09.767 --> 05:12.478
You will be lucky to have him
and his wife, Mary.

05:12.478 --> 05:13.980
Please stand, Mary.

05:16.107 --> 05:17.775
And, my God,

05:18.443 --> 05:23.239
they will be so lucky
to have all of you.

05:25.533 --> 05:27.160
He's gonna be a disaster.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.495
- Now, we have to give him a chance, Betty.
- Look at him.

05:31.205 --> 05:32.290
Look at him.

05:33.958 --> 05:36.127
Who wears an orange coat to church?

05:36.127 --> 05:38.129
- Or to anywhere?
- Honey, hey.

05:38.129 --> 05:40.923
We're to take spiritual guidance from him?

05:40.923 --> 05:43.134
Plus, where's our loyalty to Jackie?

05:43.134 --> 05:45.428
Betty. She wasn't fired.

05:45.428 --> 05:47.138
Yes, you keep saying that, Don.

05:47.138 --> 05:49.057
Well, why would she have been fired?

05:49.057 --> 05:52.018
Because she got a divorce,
and it isn't acceptable

05:52.018 --> 05:53.352
for a minister to do that.

05:53.352 --> 05:54.854
He looks so stiff and rigid.

05:55.563 --> 05:57.982
He looks like a child.

05:57.982 --> 06:01.360
Always makes me nervous
when the choir clusters.

06:02.111 --> 06:05.031
Betty thinks you're being forced out
on account of your divorce.

06:07.784 --> 06:11.746
Well, it's all been so rush-rush.
And we end up with him?

06:12.663 --> 06:14.582
- He's a child. In an orange coat.
- Betty.

06:14.582 --> 06:17.543
You need to listen to me. All of you.

06:17.543 --> 06:20.630
You need to make this church work.

06:21.422 --> 06:23.633
I want you to get along with this man.

06:24.967 --> 06:27.678
Everybody here takes their cue
from the choir.

06:30.181 --> 06:31.307
I saw that. What was that?

06:33.392 --> 06:34.352
Excuse me?

06:34.352 --> 06:36.104
You two just looked at each other
like you got a

06:38.231 --> 06:39.190
big secret.

06:48.699 --> 06:49.909
You're both on the council.

06:50.952 --> 06:53.704
You would both know church business.
Was she fired?

06:55.164 --> 06:56.374
- Were you?
- Betty.

06:56.374 --> 06:58.084
God wouldn't just call you away from us.

06:58.084 --> 06:59.836
But a bishop would.

08:05.735 --> 08:06.903
<i>Feels a little sleazy.</i>

08:06.903 --> 08:09.071
Well, I think that's what I like about it.

08:10.031 --> 08:12.450
It's six and a half dollars cheaper.

08:12.450 --> 08:14.452
I kind of like being cheap, too.
It's sexy.

08:16.787 --> 08:19.123
My goodness. This looks delicious.

08:24.754 --> 08:25.963
And so do you.

08:27.256 --> 08:29.634
I'm finger-lickin' good, I am.

08:36.474 --> 08:40.770
I found a few cookies
on my windshield at work.

08:40.770 --> 08:42.647
That wouldn't be your doing, would it?

08:42.647 --> 08:46.901
Well, gee, I don't know.
Were they snowmen? Little angels?

08:46.901 --> 08:49.237
There's all kinds of Christmas cookies,
you know.

08:49.237 --> 08:52.573
I would need more detail
before I could answer for sure.

09:02.375 --> 09:04.919
Can I ask you a question?

09:07.588 --> 09:12.176
Is Betty okay? 'Cause she got really
riled up with that whole minister thing.

09:12.176 --> 09:14.095
Betty doesn't love change.

09:14.887 --> 09:17.807
She doesn't even like contingencies.

09:19.600 --> 09:21.185
I think if she had it her way,

09:21.185 --> 09:23.938
everything would be
exactly how it is today,

09:23.938 --> 09:26.315
tomorrow, and the next day.

09:26.315 --> 09:28.442
Well, she got a little scary.

09:28.442 --> 09:30.194
You didn't even see the worst of it.

09:30.194 --> 09:33.197
You know the little angels
that people made

09:33.197 --> 09:35.157
- out of pipe cleaner and so forth?
- What about 'em?

09:37.827 --> 09:41.080
- This kind of stuff has got to go.
- Why?

09:41.080 --> 09:44.583
One of our goals will be to spruce up
our outward-facing appearance.

09:45.251 --> 09:47.628
Homemade decorations tend to convey

09:48.921 --> 09:52.091
"parochial," which is not best
for attracting new parishioners.

09:52.842 --> 09:55.261
Maybe it's you who should go.

09:56.053 --> 09:57.388
She said that?

09:58.097 --> 10:02.351
She got terrible postpartum
after Alisa was born,

10:03.102 --> 10:04.937
which had started during the pregnancy.

10:04.937 --> 10:08.399
But I think it's flaring up again.

10:08.399 --> 10:12.236
I should take her out to lunch or coffee
or something

10:12.236 --> 10:14.030
'cause I've been neglecting her
all this time

10:14.030 --> 10:16.032
while I've been not
neglecting her husband.

10:22.079 --> 10:25.166
That was a joke, Allan. I'm sorry.
It wasn't an especially good one.

10:25.166 --> 10:27.251
I just feel like an awful person.

10:28.836 --> 10:30.046
Betty's the most

10:30.838 --> 10:32.590
wonderful wife.

10:33.424 --> 10:36.260
She's pregnant with my child and

10:37.470 --> 10:40.848
here I am, in a sleazy motel room

10:42.183 --> 10:43.809
with a red velvet bedspread.

10:43.809 --> 10:48.022
You know, we're not bad people.
We just have to stay vigilant.

10:48.022 --> 10:51.484
We stick to our plan,
and we can never, ever allow

10:51.484 --> 10:54.362
Betty or Pat to get hurt.

10:54.362 --> 10:56.364
Never, ever.

10:57.573 --> 10:58.866
Ever.

11:45.121 --> 11:48.791
He has the most perfectly shaped penis
I have ever seen.

11:48.791 --> 11:51.669
Candace Lynn Montgomery.

11:51.669 --> 11:54.672
I'm not saying he puts it
to the best possible use.

11:54.672 --> 11:56.924
I still don't get it.

11:56.924 --> 11:59.844
I'm not sure I do either 'cause,
you know, like you said,

11:59.844 --> 12:01.846
he's a little paunchy, but--

12:02.555 --> 12:04.265
God, I don't know. Maybe it's a

12:04.265 --> 12:06.559
pheromone sort of thing?

12:08.269 --> 12:10.187
I don't know. It's nice to be

12:11.147 --> 12:13.232
noticed.
You know, just to be adored a little.

12:13.232 --> 12:15.025
Pat doesn't adore you?

12:17.069 --> 12:18.237
No, he does.

12:18.237 --> 12:20.739
- Just in his own way.
- Well, I have to say,

12:20.739 --> 12:23.117
part of me is a little bit jealous.

12:24.160 --> 12:27.246
I've got the imagination for adultery,
just not the guts.

12:27.872 --> 12:30.040
You know,
I'm not sure it takes guts so much.

12:31.500 --> 12:32.543
It's more like fear.

12:33.127 --> 12:34.879
You need to be careful.

12:44.722 --> 12:47.266
Everything looks normal. Fine.

12:47.766 --> 12:49.768
I'd even say perfect, with the baby.

12:49.768 --> 12:51.520
What's that supposed to mean?

12:51.520 --> 12:54.023
Well, we need to pay attention
to your hypertension and stress.

12:54.982 --> 12:56.442
That can affect the fetus.

12:57.651 --> 12:59.153
You can sit up now.

13:02.031 --> 13:05.034
So, how's everything at home?
Everything okay? Things good?

13:05.034 --> 13:07.578
Everything's like home at home.

13:07.578 --> 13:09.705
Raising one child,
getting ready to have another.

13:11.332 --> 13:12.958
Betty, he's just looking after us.

13:13.751 --> 13:15.878
Sometimes,
it feels like I'm not doing right.

13:16.712 --> 13:18.380
Not being right.

14:15.479 --> 14:17.648
This may be the best cookie
I've ever eaten.

14:18.691 --> 14:21.610
- It's so moist.
- The trick is to take 'em out early.

14:22.653 --> 14:24.488
I got the idea to just
cook 'em for only half

14:24.488 --> 14:27.366
what the recipe calls for, and <i>voil√†.</i>

14:27.366 --> 14:28.909
That's French for "perfect."

14:30.494 --> 14:33.163
- So, half-baked?
- The cookie is, not my idea.

14:35.874 --> 14:38.377
Tell me something about you
that nobody else knows.

14:41.255 --> 14:42.631
I'm not sure there is anything.

14:42.631 --> 14:44.091
Oh, come on.

14:44.091 --> 14:46.510
Something that you wouldn't want
other people to know,

14:46.510 --> 14:48.512
but you would like me to know.

14:52.683 --> 14:54.476
I don't think there is anything.

14:54.476 --> 14:57.938
There must be something
about maybe something that

14:59.982 --> 15:03.110
you're especially proud of or ashamed.

15:07.781 --> 15:11.660
Okay.
This is something I am proud of but

15:13.078 --> 15:16.790
- ashamed to admit I'm proud of.
- I love that already.

15:17.291 --> 15:18.917
In high school,

15:18.917 --> 15:24.506
I was the Kansas State Grand Champion
in the wheat competition.

15:26.383 --> 15:28.552
- The wheat competition. Yeah.
- The wheat competition?

15:28.552 --> 15:31.680
You sort through all
the stalks with tweezers.

15:32.431 --> 15:34.308
You pick out the best stuff.

15:35.893 --> 15:37.353
I can tell you're trying not to giggle.

15:37.978 --> 15:39.188
I'm not.

15:39.563 --> 15:40.689
Bob Dole

15:41.565 --> 15:46.236
presented me with the silver tray,
which is the highest award.

15:48.489 --> 15:49.490
You can laugh.

15:51.575 --> 15:52.743
So sorry!

16:03.295 --> 16:05.798
I've been thinking about

16:06.715 --> 16:10.219
something a lot,
and I'm trying to wrap my head around it.

16:10.219 --> 16:11.220
What?

16:12.596 --> 16:16.183
Betty having an affair.
It just seems so unlike her.

16:17.559 --> 16:18.435
I know.

16:21.105 --> 16:24.650
I was getting ready to leave
on a six-week business trip.

16:25.609 --> 16:28.320
She kind of went to pieces.

16:29.113 --> 16:32.241
We were living near the state college,
and, one night,

16:32.241 --> 16:34.827
she went home with one of the students.

16:34.827 --> 16:35.786
How'd you find out?

16:35.786 --> 16:37.538
She confessed.

16:38.455 --> 16:41.750
Almost right away.
I didn't even suspect anything.

16:41.750 --> 16:45.587
She just broke down in tears and,

16:47.506 --> 16:48.757
blurted it out.

16:48.757 --> 16:49.925
Part of me thinks

16:52.052 --> 16:54.930
she came clean out of guilt.

16:54.930 --> 16:58.308
- Another part.
- Another part what?

16:59.393 --> 17:02.855
I think maybe she meant to punish me

17:03.814 --> 17:04.773
for traveling.

17:05.566 --> 17:07.025
And the reason she told me.

17:08.402 --> 17:11.405
It was calculated to control

17:12.448 --> 17:13.407
my behavior.

17:19.204 --> 17:20.873
That must've hurt you a lot.

17:23.208 --> 17:24.001
It did.

17:26.962 --> 17:30.424
I have another question for you,
and it's kind of important.

17:32.217 --> 17:33.635
Okay.

17:37.264 --> 17:38.348
Do you like roller coasters?

17:55.824 --> 17:58.702
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

18:44.414 --> 18:47.584
It's so cute. Will you look at that?

18:47.584 --> 18:49.545
That is so darling!

18:50.337 --> 18:52.172
Thank you so much, Candy. It's precious.

18:52.172 --> 18:54.424
You can always exchange
if you don't like the color.

18:54.424 --> 18:56.260
What? No. I love it. I love it.

18:57.302 --> 18:59.263
- My heart.
- It looks so cute.

18:59.263 --> 19:00.973
I cannot wait to meet her.

19:02.266 --> 19:04.726
- Okay. Alright.
- Okay. Next one's from Sherry.

19:04.726 --> 19:06.395
Here we go, thank you.

19:15.612 --> 19:18.073
Oh God! Oh God!

19:18.073 --> 19:19.575
"Oh, God.

19:20.534 --> 19:22.828
"Our help in ages past.

19:24.121 --> 19:25.706
Our hope for years to come."

19:27.457 --> 19:29.126
The choir sings those words.

19:29.918 --> 19:31.128
All of you,

19:32.671 --> 19:34.423
sing those words.

19:34.423 --> 19:37.843
But, what do they mean?
Let us think about that.

19:39.887 --> 19:42.472
Well, God has helped us...

19:43.515 --> 19:45.058
- From Pat.
- ...and those before us,

19:46.018 --> 19:47.769
for ages past.

19:48.353 --> 19:50.439
And He is our hope, is He not?

19:51.481 --> 19:53.108
God, He's our...

19:53.984 --> 19:55.110
our hope.

19:55.110 --> 19:57.279
Our wonderful and eternal--

20:01.909 --> 20:04.161
Anyway, it continues.

20:05.203 --> 20:06.872
Our shelter from the stormy blast.

20:06.872 --> 20:11.084
I didn't expect him to be good,
just not that terrible.

20:11.084 --> 20:13.211
Betty wants to leave the church.

20:14.046 --> 20:17.007
- What?
- She's that put off.

20:17.466 --> 20:19.635
What, and do what? Just go back to Wylie?

20:19.635 --> 20:22.638
I don't know. It's like she's channeling

20:22.638 --> 20:26.350
everything wrong with the world
and just making him to blame.

20:32.022 --> 20:38.528
Listen, as we get closer to the day,
I'll have to stay close to home more.

20:40.364 --> 20:42.866
The last thing I want is to be here
when she goes into labor.

20:44.576 --> 20:47.371
So just for the next few weeks.

20:47.371 --> 20:48.872
Of course.

20:51.708 --> 20:55.045
You know, if she did go into labor,
and she couldn't get ahold of me,

20:56.338 --> 20:57.756
she'd call you.

20:57.756 --> 20:59.967
Well, and I would be there in a flash.

21:01.301 --> 21:03.220
I know you would. She knows it.

21:05.681 --> 21:07.099
'Cause you're a good friend.

21:17.067 --> 21:17.901
You okay?

21:24.241 --> 21:26.159
I'm gettin' in too deep.

21:28.578 --> 21:29.621
What do you mean?

21:36.420 --> 21:38.505
I don't want to fall in love with you.

21:38.505 --> 21:39.423
I don't

21:40.966 --> 21:43.510
wanna have to deal with myself
if we go too far.

21:43.510 --> 21:45.637
I think about you too much.

21:51.685 --> 21:53.186
You don't find yourself thinking

21:54.771 --> 21:56.398
too much about me?

21:58.233 --> 22:00.694
Well, I think about you all the time.

22:02.738 --> 22:04.281
It's gettin' too serious.

22:04.823 --> 22:06.158
Well...

22:08.118 --> 22:11.121
we just won't let it. Okay?

22:26.219 --> 22:27.637
Kids! Dinner!

22:31.767 --> 22:33.727
Mamma mia! That's a spicy meatball-a!

22:33.727 --> 22:35.687
Sweetie,
can you please go find your sister

22:35.687 --> 22:37.522
and tell her we're about to eat?

22:37.522 --> 22:38.774
Mamma mia!

22:39.858 --> 22:42.944
That boy watches too much television.

22:42.944 --> 22:46.865
Hey, Pat! What did we say
about spit valves at the dinner table?

22:46.865 --> 22:49.576
Hey, Jenny! Ian! Come on, let's go!

22:51.578 --> 22:52.954
Hey, did I tell you

22:52.954 --> 22:54.831
that the Gores were thinking about
leaving the church?

22:55.457 --> 22:56.750
What? Why?

22:58.043 --> 23:00.670
Betty cannot stand the new minister.

23:00.670 --> 23:03.006
And, honestly,
I don't think she's being very fair.

23:03.006 --> 23:06.510
Not everyone can be as earthy
and warm as Jackie.

23:06.510 --> 23:08.762
Well, he did tell me no more puppets.

23:09.596 --> 23:10.555
Excuse me?

23:11.848 --> 23:13.266
Put the kibosh on it.

23:13.266 --> 23:15.268
He said no more puppets
during children's sermons.

23:19.106 --> 23:19.981
I know.

23:21.608 --> 23:24.945
<i>I've been telling you from the start,
the man is cold and unfeeling.</i>

23:24.945 --> 23:26.905
And he treats his wife like property.

23:26.905 --> 23:28.990
- Have y'all noticed that?
- Alright, alright.

23:28.990 --> 23:30.909
Why do you keep defending him, Candy?

23:30.909 --> 23:34.371
Because I promised Jackie I would,
truth be told.

23:35.956 --> 23:38.583
And the way he snorts at us sometimes.

23:39.793 --> 23:43.672
That we can't hold against him.
He evidently had sinus cancer as a child.

23:44.297 --> 23:45.215
What?

23:46.424 --> 23:48.301
I just want Jackie back.

23:48.301 --> 23:50.220
We all do, honey.
We all do. We all do.

23:51.096 --> 23:54.933
Sorry, I'm a little late.
Shall we get started?

23:54.933 --> 23:57.435
- Let's start with the services.
- Excuse me?

23:59.146 --> 24:01.398
- They're boring.
- Betty.

24:01.398 --> 24:06.987
And cold! And why?
Why would you ban Pat's puppets?

24:07.988 --> 24:10.115
I did not ban them.

24:10.115 --> 24:12.659
I just said no more Peter Rabbit as Jesus.

24:12.659 --> 24:14.244
A little spontaneity
might be a good thing.

24:15.996 --> 24:18.248
Sometimes, I think you mistake this
for a social club.

24:18.248 --> 24:20.167
This is a church, Betty.

24:20.167 --> 24:21.418
Doesn't have to be a dull one.

24:21.418 --> 24:22.794
Betty.

24:23.545 --> 24:26.256
Transitions do call for some patience.

24:27.841 --> 24:31.469
I'm not a patient, Don.
Please don't treat me as one.

24:35.599 --> 24:36.725
What is going on with her?

24:37.267 --> 24:39.686
It's the stress from the pregnancy.

24:39.686 --> 24:42.105
Well, she got a little Joan Crawford.

24:42.105 --> 24:43.565
Once she has the baby,

24:43.565 --> 24:46.484
the light will come back on,
and she'll be okay.

24:47.027 --> 24:48.445
Allan-- No, never mind.

24:49.571 --> 24:52.908
- What?
- It's just what I said before.

24:54.993 --> 24:57.621
I don't know if I can handle
the way I'm feeling about you.

25:00.457 --> 25:02.292
And I know that we said that--

25:02.292 --> 25:04.419
that falling in love
was against the rules,

25:04.419 --> 25:06.630
but that's what's happening.
I'm falling in love with you.

25:07.339 --> 25:10.258
And I get scared for me,
and I worry about Pat.

25:10.258 --> 25:14.763
I mean, this would be too hard on him.

25:14.763 --> 25:16.056
And...

25:16.056 --> 25:19.142
I don't want to lose our friendship.

25:20.602 --> 25:22.354
I just don't want anybody to get hurt.

25:22.354 --> 25:23.980
I don't want this to get outta hand

25:23.980 --> 25:26.691
any more than you do, Candy.
But, honestly.

25:29.277 --> 25:30.612
You and me

25:33.240 --> 25:34.908
it's helped me and Betty somehow.

25:35.784 --> 25:38.870
- How so?
- I just feel

25:40.830 --> 25:42.249
better.

25:44.709 --> 25:47.170
I think it's because I have you.

25:48.380 --> 25:51.424
We said that if we started to get
too emotionally involved,

25:51.424 --> 25:53.426
that it-- it's over.

25:55.595 --> 25:58.056
That was our first rule.

26:16.366 --> 26:18.410
I can see the head.

26:30.213 --> 26:32.007
You have a beautiful girl.

26:33.758 --> 26:35.468
She's 100% perfect.

27:41.951 --> 27:44.454
She is so precious. I just...

27:44.454 --> 27:46.539
- I can't speak.
- Thank you.

27:49.042 --> 27:50.043
Princess.

27:50.835 --> 27:53.505
Honey, think we might need
to get Princess a new playmate.

27:53.963 --> 27:55.757
- A puppy?
- I want a puppy!

27:55.757 --> 27:56.841
Me too!

27:58.468 --> 28:00.220
She is so adorable. Can I hold her?

28:00.220 --> 28:01.471
Of course!

28:03.139 --> 28:04.182
Alright.

28:05.600 --> 28:08.645
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

28:09.521 --> 28:12.190
Is there anything like a newborn?

28:12.190 --> 28:15.151
I don't think so.

28:15.151 --> 28:18.988
You know, Bethany really is
the most beautiful little thing.

28:18.988 --> 28:20.782
Oh, thank you.

28:20.782 --> 28:23.868
Hey, Betty seems good. Bright, even.

28:24.744 --> 28:26.204
Well, she's doing better.
She's doing better.

28:27.205 --> 28:30.291
You know, in spurts.
She still has her bouts.

28:30.291 --> 28:31.793
But

28:32.794 --> 28:35.839
we're we're headed to Kansas
in a few days

28:35.839 --> 28:39.217
to introduce Bethany to the grandparents.

28:39.217 --> 28:41.136
So, you know, next week.

28:41.636 --> 28:43.847
Oh, yeah. Got it. Yeah.

28:43.847 --> 28:46.933
But we return that following Thursday.

28:48.101 --> 28:50.311
So, maybe that Friday.

28:50.937 --> 28:53.857
Friday it is. I'll get a sitter.

28:54.691 --> 28:56.109
- Great.
- Okay.

29:09.664 --> 29:10.498
Well.

29:26.222 --> 29:28.183
- Hi!
- Hey! You made it!

29:29.642 --> 29:31.269
Hi, baby.

29:32.520 --> 29:33.938
- How you doin', sir?
- Good to see you.

29:33.938 --> 29:36.983
I'm so excited to see you, little one.

29:36.983 --> 29:38.151
Hello!

30:24.280 --> 30:26.908
Mr. Mustard had just gone to bed
when his doorbell rang.

31:15.290 --> 31:16.332
Hey.

31:19.043 --> 31:22.297
- They are really loud tonight?
- Yeah.

31:23.381 --> 31:25.466
Do you ever wonder
what they all say to each other?

31:26.843 --> 31:30.221
Lord knows,
but they certainly sound chipper.

31:34.017 --> 31:35.310
What?

31:36.102 --> 31:37.520
Nothing.

31:39.355 --> 31:40.315
Why the look?

31:41.858 --> 31:43.067
Just looking at you and

31:45.153 --> 31:47.405
looking and thinking.

31:47.405 --> 31:48.990
About what?

31:52.118 --> 31:54.370
Sometimes, I forget how pretty you are.

31:58.666 --> 31:59.959
Pat.

33:00.520 --> 33:02.188
I'm sorry, honey.

33:02.689 --> 33:04.607
I'm sorry. I'm just...

33:05.817 --> 33:07.860
just really tired tonight.

33:20.289 --> 33:21.165
Don't touch me.

33:21.958 --> 33:23.209
Hey, honey.

33:27.630 --> 33:29.132
You think I don't know.

33:31.968 --> 33:33.928
That you're not attracted to me anymore?

33:33.928 --> 33:35.638
That you don't wanna touch me,
don't wanna touch me?

33:36.222 --> 33:38.015
That's not fair.

33:38.850 --> 33:39.726
That's not true.

33:39.726 --> 33:41.519
You wanna have a discussion about fair,
Allan?

33:41.519 --> 33:43.020
Why don't you start?

33:51.320 --> 33:53.865
She just kept saying,
"You don't love me anymore.

33:53.865 --> 33:57.076
- You don't love me anymore."
- Well, you did reassure her, right?

33:57.076 --> 34:02.582
Yes. But she's convinced
that I'm not attracted to her

34:02.582 --> 34:04.834
because she's fat after having a baby.

34:05.460 --> 34:06.794
Are you attracted to her?

34:08.171 --> 34:09.172
Of course.

34:10.465 --> 34:12.091
I was just spent.

34:12.091 --> 34:15.094
My tank was empty
because I'd been with you all day.

34:17.388 --> 34:19.807
The thing is, she never initiates.

34:21.100 --> 34:23.019
We haven't had sex since

34:23.936 --> 34:27.732
before Bethany was born,
so for her to make a move

34:27.732 --> 34:30.610
and to be rebuffed just...

34:32.236 --> 34:33.279
What are you gonna do?

34:37.700 --> 34:40.328
Candy, I think we should end it.

34:45.458 --> 34:46.959
Us end it?

34:46.959 --> 34:49.670
Us? No! What?

34:50.546 --> 34:51.547
No! No.

34:51.547 --> 34:53.674
- Okay.
- No, but now, you're being unfair!

34:53.674 --> 34:55.092
- I'm not-- Okay, shh.
- It's not-- Do not--

34:55.092 --> 34:57.762
No! Hey! Do not shh me!

34:59.764 --> 35:02.975
You cannot just squelch another person
and their emotions.

35:02.975 --> 35:07.105
Do not shh me ever.

35:15.112 --> 35:17.782
I'm hurting Betty, Candy.

35:17.782 --> 35:21.244
This affair is affecting my marriage now.

35:21.244 --> 35:24.956
You can't perform with Betty one time

35:25.706 --> 35:27.083
and, suddenly

35:28.167 --> 35:29.252
you wanna end it?

35:30.962 --> 35:32.713
I'm not saying that we should
definitely end it.

35:32.713 --> 35:34.882
Then what are you saying?

35:36.425 --> 35:38.845
Just that we should think about it.

35:40.930 --> 35:42.348
I don't wanna hurt her, or Pat.

35:42.348 --> 35:46.018
No. Well, 'cause he's--
He's just the best singer in the choir.

35:47.144 --> 35:48.521
We've become too close.

35:50.147 --> 35:53.067
And I'm afraid that I

35:55.653 --> 35:57.989
might not love her anymore.

36:01.409 --> 36:02.827
And I can't let that happen.

36:03.786 --> 36:07.957
We've both been using each other
to fill the gaps in our marriages,

36:07.957 --> 36:09.750
and that's not right.

36:10.543 --> 36:11.878
Right?

36:16.340 --> 36:18.551
Let's just slow it down some.

36:34.400 --> 36:35.818
Thank you all for being here today

36:35.818 --> 36:38.863
for the groundbreaking of
our wonderful new sanctuary.

36:39.780 --> 36:42.241
Now, it's my honor to cut this ribbon.

37:10.228 --> 37:12.271
- Hello?
-<i>Hey</i>.

37:13.230 --> 37:14.732
Hey, stranger.

37:15.650 --> 37:18.110
-<i>How you doin'?</i>
- Yeah, I'm good.

37:19.904 --> 37:21.239
I'm good. Yeah. You?

37:21.239 --> 37:23.115
Pretty good.

37:23.115 --> 37:26.619
Except for missing a few of those
special lunches.

37:27.995 --> 37:30.164
Yeah. Me, too.

37:34.961 --> 37:35.836
How's Betty?

37:38.130 --> 37:39.048
You know.

37:40.132 --> 37:41.467
Not too good, actually.

37:42.218 --> 37:45.846
After that night when I didn't respond,

37:45.846 --> 37:48.474
she sort of went into a hole
and hasn't come out of it.

37:51.185 --> 37:53.187
So, how are you doing?

37:53.187 --> 37:55.815
Okay. Okay.

37:57.149 --> 37:58.484
I'm taking a new job.

37:58.484 --> 38:00.695
<i>ECS Telecommunication.</i>

38:00.695 --> 38:02.947
I thought that you liked
working at Rockwell.

38:02.947 --> 38:03.990
<i>Yeah.</i>

38:03.990 --> 38:07.618
It's just if I want to
advance at the company,

38:07.618 --> 38:09.370
that would mean more travel, which,

38:09.370 --> 38:12.707
<i>- you know, isn't an option for Betty.</i>
- Nope.

38:16.085 --> 38:19.755
Why don't we get lunch
and talk face-to-face?

38:23.342 --> 38:27.430
I'm not saying I want us to end, Candy.

38:27.430 --> 38:29.390
I don't. But, I need--

38:30.933 --> 38:34.228
I need for me and Betty to get better.

38:35.646 --> 38:37.315
Stronger.

38:37.315 --> 38:39.442
You said that being with me helped.

38:39.442 --> 38:41.485
Helped me, yes.

38:41.485 --> 38:44.447
But, not me and her. Certainly not her.

38:46.907 --> 38:48.826
Is she feeling any better?

38:51.287 --> 38:53.873
She wants to go to Marriage Encounter now.

38:55.166 --> 38:56.125
Really?

38:58.252 --> 38:59.712
I think it'd do us some good.

39:02.048 --> 39:03.966
The next one is in October.

39:07.428 --> 39:08.387
What?

39:09.430 --> 39:11.474
Marriage Encounter will be the end of us.

39:13.434 --> 39:14.602
Let's just see what happens.

39:16.604 --> 39:18.522
Candy, let's just see what happens.

39:30.201 --> 39:32.495
I really hate to ask you this right now.

39:33.204 --> 39:34.371
But

39:36.040 --> 39:37.875
it takes place over a weekend,

39:37.875 --> 39:42.546
and Betty was wondering,
as was I, if you and Pat

39:42.546 --> 39:44.256
could possibly take the kids.

39:46.175 --> 39:47.593
Alisa loves you,

39:47.593 --> 39:50.763
and Betty won't trust anyone else
with Bethany.

39:52.098 --> 39:54.016
It would just-- It would be.

39:55.476 --> 39:56.769
Sure.

39:58.145 --> 39:59.105
I'd be glad to.

40:27.424 --> 40:29.009
You never mentioned a castle.

40:29.009 --> 40:30.803
I did not know, honey.

40:40.229 --> 40:42.148
I really don't know about this.

40:43.524 --> 40:46.235
Well, let's hope the food's good at least.

40:47.778 --> 40:50.781
Spouses are expected to be
at each other's sides

40:50.781 --> 40:52.575
at all times.

40:52.575 --> 40:55.953
I should add at the side
of your own spouse.

40:57.663 --> 41:02.293
Sometimes, we get couples from California,
so I always make sure.

41:02.293 --> 41:05.838
Televisions are not to be turned on
in the rooms.

41:05.838 --> 41:09.508
Not even a little.
No phones, no newspapers.

41:09.508 --> 41:11.302
Nothing to get in the way

41:11.302 --> 41:14.597
of couples communicating
about their feelings.

41:15.055 --> 41:17.349
<i>I will take the opportunity right now</i>

41:17.349 --> 41:21.312
<i>to propose your first
Marriage Encounter question,</i>

41:21.312 --> 41:23.564
<i>which you will each endeavor to answer</i>

41:23.564 --> 41:26.859
<i>in your individual
Marriage Encounter notebooks.</i>

41:26.859 --> 41:30.988
<i>You'll find these in your room.
The question is as follows.</i>

41:32.573 --> 41:39.246
Why did I come here this weekend,
and what do I hope to gain?

41:41.624 --> 41:44.835
It says, in very bold letters,

41:46.337 --> 41:49.882
that once we finish,
we're to exchange notebooks with a kiss.

41:52.218 --> 41:57.097
Then read each other's answers
and discuss how it makes us feel.

42:14.531 --> 42:16.158
<i>It's killing you, isn't it?</i>

42:16.158 --> 42:19.745
I'm happy for them.
I'm glad for Allan.

42:19.745 --> 42:21.705
It's killing you.

42:21.705 --> 42:25.000
Well, it bugs me that he's
in some hotel room with her,

42:25.000 --> 42:27.670
gettin' all gooey with her.

42:27.670 --> 42:29.588
You know, I made him a better lover.

42:29.588 --> 42:32.883
He didn't even know how to French kiss.
I practically trained him.

42:32.883 --> 42:36.095
And it seems like Bad Mood Betty
gets all the benefit

42:36.095 --> 42:39.598
while I'm babysitting her kids.

42:39.598 --> 42:40.724
Really?

42:40.724 --> 42:43.018
You're the one who said
he was fall-in-love-proof.

42:43.894 --> 42:46.939
I got an idea.
Why don't we go out tonight?

42:47.481 --> 42:49.900
There's a new club just opened up,

42:49.900 --> 42:51.443
and everybody's saying how fun it is.

42:51.443 --> 42:53.070
I have to babysit the kids.

42:53.070 --> 42:55.531
Oh, come on! Pat can watch 'em.

42:55.531 --> 42:58.534
Couple of hours, girls' night out.

42:58.534 --> 42:59.535
It'll be fun.

43:01.036 --> 43:04.290
You know,
sometimes the best path to happiness

43:04.290 --> 43:05.958
is just to feign it.

43:05.958 --> 43:08.502
Just to give in to the illusion of it.

43:08.502 --> 43:11.005
Well, I thought
that's what I was doing with Allan.

43:11.880 --> 43:15.467
- Didn't even know how to French kiss.
- We're goin'.

43:15.467 --> 43:18.846
"It's hard for me to talk about sex, too.

43:19.638 --> 43:22.641
"Sometimes,
it's so hard to feel calm and quiet

43:22.641 --> 43:24.643
"as you need to be to enjoy sex.

43:25.936 --> 43:29.064
"I guess the relaxation part
is the hardest part for me.

43:29.064 --> 43:31.442
"That's why, in Switzerland,

43:31.442 --> 43:34.987
"a little, or a lot, of wine helped.

43:35.946 --> 43:39.867
It relaxed me so I could
really be free to enjoy it all."

43:39.867 --> 43:42.703
"Does this mean
I'm not comfortable with sex.

43:42.703 --> 43:44.913
"if I need wine to make love
more pleasant?

43:44.913 --> 43:46.415
I don't know."

43:54.590 --> 43:56.759
How does that make you feel?

43:56.759 --> 43:58.260
Well, I feel

43:59.595 --> 44:02.639
more aware with your insecurities.

44:02.639 --> 44:04.933
I'm not sure that awareness is a feeling.

44:05.434 --> 44:08.228
There's no rule about
what constitutes a feeling.

44:08.228 --> 44:10.064
Yes, it's in those workbooks
that they gave us.

44:10.064 --> 44:11.815
It's not about what you think.

44:12.775 --> 44:15.819
It's about how you emotionally respond.

44:15.819 --> 44:20.157
Being aware of my insecurity over sex
is not a feeling.

44:20.908 --> 44:24.244
We're not supposed to
judge each other's reactions.

44:24.244 --> 44:27.414
- It says that.
- I've said several things

44:27.414 --> 44:29.792
specifically about sex

44:33.128 --> 44:36.465
and you haven't really responded. At all.

44:38.175 --> 44:39.593
And I think I know

44:41.095 --> 44:42.471
why, Allan.

44:50.145 --> 44:51.355
You don't desire me.

44:54.108 --> 44:56.902
- That is not true.
- No, you never touch me, and you--

44:56.902 --> 44:59.571
Because you send the message,
"Don't touch me."

44:59.571 --> 45:01.281
The core principle

45:03.367 --> 45:06.286
of this Encounter is honesty.

45:08.872 --> 45:14.044
Are you sexually attracted to me, Allan?

45:16.213 --> 45:18.674
I promise you I am.

45:24.138 --> 45:26.056
I am. Hey.

45:28.225 --> 45:29.351
What?

45:30.853 --> 45:34.606
I've been so worried and scared
that you don't want me.

45:34.606 --> 45:37.443
That you don't desire me.
That maybe you don't even

45:38.402 --> 45:39.361
love me anymore.

45:40.028 --> 45:42.573
Well, that's not true. I do. I love you.

45:42.573 --> 45:44.366
Betty.

45:44.366 --> 45:45.492
I desire you.

45:46.910 --> 45:49.037
We're here because I desire you.

45:50.789 --> 45:51.915
Because I miss you.

46:02.468 --> 46:03.802
I'd like to fornicate.

46:12.895 --> 46:14.313
I'd like to.

47:16.083 --> 47:17.876
Body of Christ, given for you.

47:17.876 --> 47:23.131
<i>I realized that what I was feeling
was not, "I don't like you,"</i>

47:23.131 --> 47:26.218
<i>but more like,
"I don't feel excited about you</i>

47:26.218 --> 47:27.678
<i>because I'm too used
to the way things are."</i>

47:27.678 --> 47:29.471
Body of Christ, given for you.

47:29.471 --> 47:31.306
<i>I want to share a lot more
of your feelings,</i>

47:31.306 --> 47:34.434
<i>and I want to be able to
share mine with you.</i>

47:39.481 --> 47:43.777
<i>When I think of your being gone more,
I remember those times with dread.</i>

47:43.777 --> 47:45.904
Blood of Christ, shed for you.

47:45.904 --> 47:47.030
<i>The aloneness.</i>

47:47.030 --> 47:48.824
Blood of Christ, shed for you.

47:48.824 --> 47:52.744
<i>I never really felt fear for my safety
at home alone</i>

47:52.744 --> 47:54.413
<i>but the feeling of being alone</i>

47:56.039 --> 47:59.251
<i>is the worst possible one to have.</i>

47:59.251 --> 48:01.795
<i>It's like you're in a dark tunnel,</i>

48:01.795 --> 48:04.548
<i>and you've got a long ways
to go to the light.</i>

48:05.132 --> 48:07.759
<i>The light isn't there
till you're home again,</i>

48:07.759 --> 48:09.761
<i>safe and sound.</i>

48:09.761 --> 48:13.682
<i>And sometimes, the times you are gone
made the tunnel very long.</i>

48:14.683 --> 48:19.855
In the name of God,
I, Allan, take you, Betty, to be my wife.

48:19.855 --> 48:25.485
To have and to hold,
from this day forward.

48:25.485 --> 48:29.156
For better or worse, richer or poorer.

48:29.156 --> 48:32.159
<i>For better or worse, richer or poorer.</i>

48:32.159 --> 48:34.578
For better or worse, richer or poorer.

48:34.578 --> 48:36.079
To love and to cherish.

48:36.705 --> 48:37.914
<i>To love and cherish.</i>

48:39.374 --> 48:44.004
Until we are parted by death.

48:46.465 --> 48:47.883
This is my solemn vow.

48:48.300 --> 48:49.718
This is my solemn vow.

48:50.636 --> 48:54.806
By the power vested in me
by Jesus Christ, our Lord,

48:54.806 --> 48:56.683
it is my sincere pleasure

48:56.683 --> 48:59.102
to re-pronounce you both

48:59.102 --> 49:01.104
as man and wife.

49:36.932 --> 49:39.351
- Hi!
- Hey!

49:44.481 --> 49:45.816
Hi!

49:46.692 --> 49:48.819
- Hi.
- Hey, sweetie. You have fun?

49:48.819 --> 49:50.404
- Yeah. Yeah.
- You did?

49:50.404 --> 49:52.614
- Hey. Great.
- How was it?

49:52.614 --> 49:55.784
- Pat, thanks again.
- Hey, Allan! Yeah, of course. Any time.

49:56.493 --> 49:57.452
Hey.

50:09.881 --> 50:12.008
There's my little angel!

50:12.008 --> 50:13.969
How'd she do?

50:13.969 --> 50:16.847
She was perfect.
Like little angels are.

50:18.056 --> 50:19.099
Hi.

50:19.766 --> 50:21.143
Here you go.

50:21.643 --> 50:22.811
Thank you.

50:24.020 --> 50:28.817
Thank you so much for taking them.
I am beyond grateful.

50:28.817 --> 50:31.361
Are you kidding me?
I love having them.

50:31.361 --> 50:34.489
Especially since Jenny is sweeter
when Alisa comes over.

50:36.908 --> 50:38.660
I missed you, my little girl.

50:39.286 --> 50:40.495
So, how was it?

50:43.248 --> 50:44.207
It was amazing.

50:45.542 --> 50:47.878
- Yeah?
- It was really great.

50:47.878 --> 50:49.796
Great.

50:49.796 --> 50:51.923
I was skeptical. I really was.

50:52.674 --> 50:56.344
But, honest to God,
it was the best thing.

50:58.597 --> 51:01.892
You and Pat, you should think about it.

51:01.892 --> 51:04.102
- Not that you need it or anything.
- All set, honey.

51:05.020 --> 51:07.314
Alright. Here I come.

51:07.314 --> 51:10.108
- Thank you again so much.
- Any time.

51:10.108 --> 51:11.234
Any time.

51:14.321 --> 51:15.447
Careful.

51:16.865 --> 51:18.241
- Got it?
- Hey.

51:24.414 --> 51:26.708
So, it was good, Betty says.

51:26.708 --> 51:30.212
Better than I could have imagined.

51:30.212 --> 51:32.172
I'm glad to hear it.

51:32.172 --> 51:33.882
- I'll call you.
- Yep.

51:35.258 --> 51:36.301
Bye!

51:41.723 --> 51:43.683
Alright. That should do it.

51:47.604 --> 51:50.607
- Thanks again, guys.
- Yeah.

51:53.527 --> 51:54.903
- Thank you for--
- Bye-bye!

51:58.949 --> 52:00.867
- Bye!
- Bye, guys.
