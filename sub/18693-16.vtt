10:13.232 --> 10:14.498
Once I was free,

10:14.533 --> 10:17.034
I returned the favor.

10:22.341 --> 10:24.475
I'm afraid it's not
a very nice place.

10:24.510 --> 10:27.011
The first day I was there,

10:27.046 --> 10:29.113
they started burning my skin.

10:33.285 --> 10:34.385
Just one layer at a time.

10:34.420 --> 10:38.122
They said I was too
pretty for their world...

10:39.539 --> 10:40.863
Too human.

10:45.398 --> 10:47.297
So they made me hideous.

10:51.170 --> 10:53.971
But they also taught me how
to use my demon blood...

10:54.006 --> 10:57.207
how to... draw from its power.

10:57.243 --> 11:00.978
See, I may be grotesque
in my own skin,

11:01.013 --> 11:04.048
but... with it I have power
that you could only dream of.

11:06.252 --> 11:09.119
Then why keep the
Verlac boy's visage

11:09.155 --> 11:11.455
if you're weaker for it?

11:11.490 --> 11:14.458
I think it rather suits me.

11:14.493 --> 11:17.094
Don't you?

11:17.129 --> 11:22.332
As does the accent.
A bit more... charming

11:22.368 --> 11:25.952
than a demonic beast
with burnt flesh.

11:27.705 --> 11:29.139
Jonathan...

11:29.175 --> 11:31.442
I know what I did
to you was horrific,

11:31.477 --> 11:33.377
but let me make it up to you...

11:35.232 --> 11:37.181
Azazel wanted the Mortal Cup.

11:37.216 --> 11:39.116
Unchain me,

11:39.151 --> 11:40.284
and it's yours.

11:40.319 --> 11:42.986
(SCOFFING)

11:44.056 --> 11:47.157
You still don't
understand, do you?

11:47.193 --> 11:48.992
See, I don't give a damn

11:49.028 --> 11:50.748
about your Mortal Instruments.
I never have.

11:51.776 --> 11:54.098
I used Azazel to stage an
attack on the Lightwood girl

11:54.133 --> 11:55.377
in order to gain access
to the Institute.

11:55.401 --> 11:57.968
What he did after
that, however...

11:58.003 --> 11:59.693
amusing...

12:01.173 --> 12:02.306
it was none of my concern.

12:02.341 --> 12:04.174
And yet you wouldn't
have just brought me here

12:04.210 --> 12:06.074
if you were just going
to torture me to death.

12:08.114 --> 12:09.313
So what are you planning?

12:09.348 --> 12:12.216
Don't worry, father.

12:18.124 --> 12:20.390
You'll find out soon enough.

12:22.361 --> 12:24.261
I still can't believe
you made a portal rune.

12:24.296 --> 12:26.274
- You've said that already.
- You don't understand.

12:26.298 --> 12:28.165
It took warlocks
thousands of years

12:28.200 --> 12:29.166
to learn how to use portals,

12:29.201 --> 12:30.321
and you just improvised one.

12:32.204 --> 12:33.482
JACE: I wanna get out
of here before dark.

12:33.506 --> 12:35.372
These woods are home
to several packs

12:35.407 --> 12:37.407
of notoriously feral werewolves.

12:37.443 --> 12:40.110
Valentine certainly
has interesting ideas

12:40.146 --> 12:41.278
about what's kid friendly...

12:41.313 --> 12:43.413
Yeah, well, even he wouldn't
let me go near the lake.

12:46.285 --> 12:48.018
Whoa.

12:48.053 --> 12:49.319
JACE: You OK?

12:52.224 --> 12:53.357
Yeah, I'm fine.

12:55.127 --> 12:57.447
You know an Iratze might be
able to help you out with that.

12:58.297 --> 13:00.164
Oh no.

13:00.199 --> 13:02.065
I don't have my stele.

13:02.101 --> 13:03.821
I must have dropped it
when I hit the water.

13:06.372 --> 13:08.972
Don't look at me.
I left mine in New York.

13:09.008 --> 13:10.118
Someone pulled me
through the portal

13:10.142 --> 13:11.153
before I had time to get it.

13:11.177 --> 13:12.142
You know what? It's OK.

13:12.178 --> 13:13.321
I mean,
we don't even need a stele.

13:13.345 --> 13:15.190
You can activate your
runes without them, right?

13:15.214 --> 13:18.115
Yeah, I mean...
you know, theoretically.

13:19.107 --> 13:21.185
And you were giving me
crap about my portal?

13:21.220 --> 13:23.220
I didn't say I couldn't do it.

13:26.058 --> 13:27.224
(GASPING)

13:27.259 --> 13:28.292
Yeah, on second thought,

13:28.327 --> 13:30.394
my stele might
actually come in handy.

13:30.429 --> 13:32.329
We should head back to the lake

13:32.364 --> 13:34.264
and see if we can find it.

13:44.143 --> 13:46.043
Dad, what's going on?

13:46.078 --> 13:47.377
Nothing. Why?

13:47.413 --> 13:49.413
Max missed his training
session this morning

13:49.448 --> 13:51.215
because he wouldn't
leave his room.

13:51.250 --> 13:53.083
He said you screamed at him,

13:53.118 --> 13:54.396
and told him to keep the
whole thing a secret?

13:54.420 --> 13:57.054
You've barely ever
raised your voice.

13:57.089 --> 13:59.156
What could Max
possibly have done?

13:59.191 --> 14:01.158
It was nothing, it's just...

14:01.193 --> 14:03.293
Look, with Valentine free

14:03.329 --> 14:04.406
I've been under a lot
of stress lately, and...

14:04.430 --> 14:05.996
Dad...

14:06.031 --> 14:07.197
(SIGHING)

14:10.102 --> 14:12.369
My Max sure seems to have a
talent for finding trouble.

14:19.078 --> 14:22.379
I caught him reading through a
file of private fire messages

14:22.414 --> 14:24.214
that I had received
from the Inquisitor

14:24.250 --> 14:26.283
and... well,

14:26.318 --> 14:27.384
you know the rest.

14:27.419 --> 14:30.320
Private fire messages?
It's not what you think.

14:30.356 --> 14:33.223
Look, it's above your
security clearance.

14:33.259 --> 14:34.424
I've said too much already.

14:34.460 --> 14:37.361
(SIGHING)

14:37.396 --> 14:39.963
I should go talk to Max.

Are you going somewhere?

14:57.283 --> 14:59.149
Yeah, I'm coming with you.

14:59.184 --> 15:01.018
No way... Look, um,

15:01.053 --> 15:03.053
I really appreciate the offer

15:03.088 --> 15:04.321
but Yom Kippur is not

15:04.356 --> 15:06.256
a bring your friends
kind of holiday.

15:06.292 --> 15:07.958
I wasn't asking.

15:09.328 --> 15:10.360
I mean, I...

15:10.396 --> 15:12.140
I didn't even tell my
family I was dating Clary.

15:12.164 --> 15:13.430
And how would I explain this?

15:13.465 --> 15:15.198
Hey Mom, meet Maia,
my werewolf friend

15:15.234 --> 15:16.411
who knows I turned a guy to dust

15:16.435 --> 15:18.146
and now she's kinda worried
that I might hurt you,

15:18.170 --> 15:19.970
- or tell you I'm a vampire, or...
- OK, look.

15:21.106 --> 15:22.205
Just let me come with you.

15:57.109 --> 15:58.976

apologizes to Max,

I know you're still upset
about the whole affair,

16:04.016 --> 16:07.050
but think about it.
Valentine escaped under our watch,

16:07.086 --> 16:09.052
and yet Dad somehow
convinced the Inquisitor

16:09.088 --> 16:10.187
to let you keep your job?

16:10.222 --> 16:12.189
What leverage could
he possibly have

16:12.224 --> 16:14.057
to do something like that?

16:14.887 --> 16:16.126
Did he say anything?

you kept me prisoner

you brought it on yourself.

I would never have
killed my own father.

18:33.537 --> 18:36.038
Gave me my first chemistry set.

18:36.073 --> 18:37.973
Taught me the basic
laws of physics.

18:38.009 --> 18:40.309
When I saw Albert on the bridge,

18:40.344 --> 18:42.411
I was... I was just curious.

18:46.183 --> 18:48.984
Would a 32 foot fall kill a boy?

Yes, it will.
