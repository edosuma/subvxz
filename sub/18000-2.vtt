[train whistle blows]

00:09.491 --> 00:13.427
You guys never pondered
technology-based heroes

00:13.462 --> 00:16.163
Versus magic-based heroes?

00:16.198 --> 00:17.932
All day, every day.
That's all I ponder.

00:17.966 --> 00:19.800
- [laughter]
- Right?

00:19.835 --> 00:24.472
Come on, man, I'm serious.
Can technology best magic?

00:24.506 --> 00:26.307
I mean,
at the outset, yeah,

00:26.341 --> 00:28.876
But there's no electricity,
it's all gone.

00:28.911 --> 00:29.977
The magic is always there,
right?

00:30.012 --> 00:31.379
Right, that's right.

00:31.413 --> 00:33.548
Your magical heroes
are by and large corny

00:33.582 --> 00:34.549
- Though, right?
- Whoa.

00:34.583 --> 00:37.785
- Like Harry Potter: Corny.
- What?

00:37.819 --> 00:40.621
Lords of the Rings, like,
all that stuff's corny, man.

00:40.656 --> 00:42.323
I think you got to get
more in the real world.

00:42.357 --> 00:45.693
Bill Gates versus David Blaine...
Who wins?

00:45.727 --> 00:47.194
- Bill Gates.
- Why?

00:47.229 --> 00:48.963
Because David Blaine
isn't really magic, so...

00:48.997 --> 00:51.632
[laughter]

00:51.667 --> 00:53.701

Hello, and welcome to another
episode of Comic Book Men,

01:27.736 --> 01:30.054
The only show that can do
the Green Lantern oath

01:30.088 --> 01:31.689
- In Klingon.
- [laughs]

01:31.723 --> 01:32.974
I'm Kevin Smith.

01:33.008 --> 01:34.375
- Bryan Johnson.
- Walt Flanagan.

01:34.409 --> 01:35.793
- Mike Zapcic.
- Ming Chen.

01:35.827 --> 01:38.179
All right, boys,
give the fat man the skinny.

01:38.213 --> 01:41.282
What sold this week?

01:44.319 --> 01:45.753
Enjoy.
Have great afternoon.

01:45.787 --> 01:47.088
- See you later.
- Thank you.

01:47.122 --> 01:48.756
How you guys
doing today?

01:48.790 --> 01:49.790
How you doing?

01:49.825 --> 01:52.426
I am after some Hot Toys.

01:52.461 --> 01:54.161
I mean, we got
a lot of Hot Toys here.

01:54.196 --> 01:56.097
Like, you mean Hot Toys,
the brand?

01:56.131 --> 01:57.498
Yeah, Hot Toys,
the brand, yeah.

01:57.532 --> 02:00.401
Specifically,
Dark Knight-related Hot Toys.

02:00.435 --> 02:02.470
I think we may have.
What about the...

02:02.504 --> 02:03.504
- The Batman?
- The Batman.

02:03.538 --> 02:04.905
Yeah, hang on.

02:04.940 --> 02:07.274
- Into the Batman, huh?
- Yeah, yeah, big time.

02:07.309 --> 02:08.309
Favorite Batman?

02:08.342 --> 02:09.710
I'd have to say
Christian Bale.

02:09.745 --> 02:11.445
The trilogy
means a lot to me.

02:11.480 --> 02:13.314
The portrayal
and respect for the character...

02:13.348 --> 02:14.849
I don't think anything
comes close.

02:14.883 --> 02:17.518
So not Val Kilmer then?
[laughter]

02:17.552 --> 02:20.988
- Check it out.
- Okay, so wow...

02:21.023 --> 02:24.091
The Dark Knight Rises,
Hot Toys.

02:29.031 --> 02:30.998
I can tell by the box
this is the piece

02:31.033 --> 02:32.800
That I've been after
for some time now.

02:32.834 --> 02:34.402
What does "DX" mean?

02:34.436 --> 02:38.839
The DX12 is the latest issue
of The Dark Knight Batman.

02:38.874 --> 02:41.642
I don't think there's
a finer manufacturer

02:41.677 --> 02:44.311
Of high-end action figures
on the market today

02:44.346 --> 02:46.047
- Than the Hot Toys.
- Every time they put one out,

02:46.081 --> 02:47.381
They're more and more
realistic.

02:47.416 --> 02:50.017
They go out of their way
to make the action figure

02:50.052 --> 02:52.353
Pretty screen accurate.
The heads are removable

02:52.387 --> 02:54.555
To reenact different scenes
from the films.

02:54.589 --> 02:57.224
They're highly poseable,
and the production's limited,

02:57.259 --> 02:58.559
So they're highly
sought-after, and...

02:58.593 --> 02:59.694
They're pricey though,
ain't they?

02:59.728 --> 03:01.095
Yes, yes they are.

03:01.129 --> 03:03.297
These are
big action figures,

03:03.331 --> 03:06.233
With the amount of accessories
that a young Kevin Smith

03:06.268 --> 03:08.469
Would have just, you know,
lost his mind over.

03:08.503 --> 03:10.471
But these kind of toys,
they're not for kids.

03:10.505 --> 03:12.539
Nobody's buying
this Batman version

03:12.557 --> 03:13.808
And giving it to a child.

03:13.842 --> 03:15.342
Not after you paid
500 bucks for it,

03:15.376 --> 03:16.877
Unless that kid
is Richie Rich.

03:16.912 --> 03:18.913
[laughter]

03:18.947 --> 03:20.948
So why you looking
to get this one, though?

03:20.982 --> 03:22.383
Well, this would be

03:22.417 --> 03:24.719
The second-to-last piece
in my collection.

03:24.753 --> 03:27.722
I've got a entire floor
of my house devoted to Batman.

03:27.756 --> 03:28.956
- An entire floor?
- Yeah.

03:28.990 --> 03:30.491
A man cave of sorts.

03:30.525 --> 03:33.160
I can promise you this...
nobody that you know

03:33.195 --> 03:36.030
- Has a Batcave like my Batcave.
- Really?

03:36.064 --> 03:38.566
We're talking
secret entrance,

03:38.600 --> 03:41.535
- Batsuit, 120-inch screen.
- What?

03:41.570 --> 03:43.104
You know,
the whole deal.

03:43.138 --> 03:44.405
It's a secret room
in your house?

03:44.439 --> 03:45.840
Yeah,
it's in the basement.

03:45.874 --> 03:47.742
An unassuming person
would walk down there

03:47.776 --> 03:50.911
And have no idea
that room even exists.

03:50.946 --> 03:52.513
Why haven't I
done this yet?

03:52.547 --> 03:54.782
I mean, we all have
our versions of a man cave.

03:54.816 --> 03:56.534
Some are more elaborate
than others.

03:56.568 --> 03:58.652
Mine is a bathroom
that's all mine.

03:58.686 --> 04:01.155
I go in there,
sit down for an hour, get lost,

04:01.189 --> 04:02.323
And people are like,
"Where's Kevin?"

04:02.357 --> 04:03.791
They're like,
"In the Batcave."

04:03.825 --> 04:05.359
But it's decked out nice,
with, like, some...

04:05.377 --> 04:07.461
You know, some, some...

04:07.496 --> 04:09.964
Not really.
[laughter]

04:09.998 --> 04:11.665
- No ephemera, it's just...
- Oh, okay.

04:11.700 --> 04:13.801
It's more of a "name only"
kind of thing.

04:13.835 --> 04:17.004
So what does the wife think
about you creating a Batcave?

04:17.038 --> 04:19.173
You know, she's been
surprisingly cool with it.

04:19.207 --> 04:20.808
- Right, it's all hidden, right?
- Yup, yup.

04:20.841 --> 04:22.676
That's the way we got to go.
We got to hide it, man.

04:22.711 --> 04:24.145
- We got to hide it?
- Yeah.

04:24.179 --> 04:26.147
That's the key to a good
marriage... just hide everything.

04:26.181 --> 04:27.348
[laughter]

04:27.382 --> 04:30.050
No, I meant your collectables
and your...

04:30.085 --> 04:31.318
- Oh, right.
- And your... you know,

04:31.353 --> 04:32.586
- Your little treasures.
- That's what I was

04:32.621 --> 04:33.788
Talking about too.

04:33.822 --> 04:38.893
Not your sexuality, right?
[laughter]

04:38.927 --> 04:41.362
All right, man.
Wrap it up?

04:41.396 --> 04:43.697
Well, I notice
you're asking close to 500.

04:43.732 --> 04:47.234
I was hoping, you know,
maybe to track one down

04:47.269 --> 04:49.837
More in the 400 to 425
range.

04:49.871 --> 04:52.039
It's a DX man, a DX.

04:52.073 --> 04:55.810
I mean, I probably
can get 495 easy.

04:55.844 --> 05:00.748
Could you do 450
and a trip to the Batcave?

05:00.782 --> 05:02.349
- You're serious?
- Yeah, yeah.

05:02.384 --> 05:03.818
That'd be
absolutely awesome.

05:03.852 --> 05:06.320
You're inviting us all
down to your Batcave?

05:06.354 --> 05:08.189
Yeah, in fact, I can do it
as soon as this weekend.

05:08.223 --> 05:10.691
You'd see everything,
the whole deal.

05:10.725 --> 05:12.660
I-I don't think
I can refuse this.

05:12.694 --> 05:14.995
An invitation
to the Batcave

05:15.030 --> 05:16.664
Only comes around
once in a lifetime.

05:16.698 --> 05:18.265
I can assure you,
you won't be disappointed.

05:18.300 --> 05:20.167
Well, then,
if I am disappointed,

05:20.202 --> 05:23.404
I'm gonna want that 50 back,
cause I'm gonna take the 450.

05:23.438 --> 05:24.972
- I can live with that.
- All right, man, deal.

05:25.006 --> 05:26.707
Got a deal.

05:28.810 --> 05:31.412
So here's my address
and cell phone number.

05:31.446 --> 05:32.546
All right, man.
We'll be there.

05:32.581 --> 05:34.048
- Really looking forward to it.
- Thank you.

05:34.082 --> 05:35.716
- Thank you.
- See you later.

05:35.750 --> 05:37.551
[whispering]
Batcave.

05:37.586 --> 05:39.220
- Hey, Mike.
- Yeah?

05:39.254 --> 05:40.888
That guy that was just in here
just invited us...

05:40.922 --> 05:42.590
- He has his own Batcave.
- Oh.

05:42.624 --> 05:45.726
I can't go. I'm going
to a wedding with my family.

05:45.760 --> 05:48.262
All right, well, it looks like
it's just us three then.

05:48.296 --> 05:51.165
- I'll drive.
- It's gonna be awesome, baby.

05:51.199 --> 05:52.666
Got something
you might want to check out.

05:52.701 --> 05:53.934
- Oh, wow.
- Wow.

05:53.969 --> 05:55.202
The original 12.

05:55.237 --> 05:56.370
Check it out, man.

05:56.404 --> 05:59.340
- Wow.
- This is some setup.

06:04.656 --> 06:06.791
You know what my all-time
favorite talking dog is?

06:06.825 --> 06:08.626
[laughs] No.
[laughter]

06:08.660 --> 06:10.094
Hong Kong Phooey.

06:10.128 --> 06:12.363
Worked as a janitor
in a police station,

06:12.397 --> 06:15.766
But by night, Bruce Lee.
The Scatman.

06:15.801 --> 06:18.069
They used to call me that
in grade school

06:18.103 --> 06:19.770
Until I was able
to control my bowels.

06:19.805 --> 06:22.073
[laughter]

06:22.107 --> 06:24.308
You got a favorite all-time
talking dog?

06:24.342 --> 06:26.143
Ren from Ren and Stimpy?

06:26.178 --> 06:28.546
Don't try to play
to the in crowd with...

06:28.580 --> 06:31.315
To hipster Mike over here?
[laughter]

06:31.349 --> 06:33.050
Who's your favorite all-time
talking dog?

06:33.085 --> 06:35.920
- Uh, I loved Astro.
- Jetsons.

06:35.954 --> 06:37.488
- I loved him.
- He is kind of, like,

06:37.522 --> 06:39.824
The third class
of the talking dogs, though.

06:39.858 --> 06:42.560
He was just barely
in a couple episodes.

06:42.594 --> 06:44.628
I guess that says a little bit
about, you know, Mike,

06:44.663 --> 06:45.863
With that kind of choice,
right?

06:45.897 --> 06:48.265
Yeah, like, barely noticed.
[laughter]

06:48.300 --> 06:50.234
Did your family forget
to feed you a lot growing up?

06:50.268 --> 06:51.469
- Like...
- [laughs]

06:51.503 --> 06:54.071
"Oh, that's right,
we have a son."

06:58.677 --> 07:00.377
- What's happening, guys?
- Hey, how you doing?

07:00.412 --> 07:02.713
Got something you might
want to check out.

07:02.748 --> 07:05.750
From a long, long time ago.

07:07.819 --> 07:09.220
- Oh, wow.
- Wow.

07:09.254 --> 07:11.255
- Oh, ho ho.
- It's the original 12.

07:11.289 --> 07:12.690
That's amazing.

07:12.724 --> 07:14.692
- The '76...
- the original 12, first series.

07:14.726 --> 07:15.926
Yes, yes.

07:23.101 --> 07:25.970
With a display case.
I've never seen a display case.

07:26.004 --> 07:28.973
It's funny too, the display
stand is what I really love.

07:29.007 --> 07:30.107
When the movie came out,

07:30.142 --> 07:31.308
You couldn't get
the action figures...

07:31.343 --> 07:33.410
- Right.
- And then, christmas of '77,

07:33.445 --> 07:35.646
If you got the Early Bird,
you could send away for this,

07:35.680 --> 07:36.781
And you had something
to put them on

07:36.815 --> 07:38.716
Before any of the other
vehicles or toys.

07:38.750 --> 07:40.117
I remember filling out
the self-addressed,

07:40.152 --> 07:42.753
Stamped envelope as a kid
and the two proof of purchases

07:42.788 --> 07:44.522
From any of the figures,
and, like, 2 bucks,

07:44.556 --> 07:45.689
Waiting four to six weeks,

07:45.724 --> 07:48.025
And I thought it was
the coolest thing ever.

07:48.059 --> 07:49.827
The magic of mail away.

07:49.861 --> 07:51.361
[laughter]
Ohh.

07:51.379 --> 07:54.398
Where in order to get something,
you didn't go to the internet.

07:54.432 --> 07:55.800
You had to mail away.

07:55.834 --> 07:58.269
You'd actually have to get out
an envelope, address it,

07:58.303 --> 08:00.771
Usually $2, usually
a proof of purchase stamp

08:00.805 --> 08:02.640
Of some sort,
and they promised

08:02.674 --> 08:05.142
In eight to ten weeks
something great would happen.

08:05.177 --> 08:06.644
- Oh, yeah.
- My parents didn't

08:06.678 --> 08:08.145
Buy into it right away.
They were like,

08:08.180 --> 08:09.413
"This is some kind
of pyramid scheme.

08:09.431 --> 08:10.881
Is this amway or something?"

08:10.915 --> 08:13.050
[laughter]

08:13.084 --> 08:14.785
So you're looking
to move it today?

08:14.820 --> 08:17.555
I am. I actually
just acquired a new business.

08:17.589 --> 08:18.989
I bought out my partner.
I own a bar.

08:19.024 --> 08:20.591
- Okay.
- Trying to make some room,

08:20.625 --> 08:21.992
Make a few bucks,
'cause every... you know,

08:22.027 --> 08:23.594
When you own your own business,
every penny counts.

08:23.628 --> 08:26.730
This is one I hate to see go,
but I think it's got good value,

08:26.765 --> 08:28.299
- So...
- It does appeal to me

08:28.333 --> 08:30.434
Because all the figures
are here on... and the stand.

08:30.468 --> 08:31.769
It looks like, you know,
it looks like

08:31.803 --> 08:33.470
It's a really
excellent piece,

08:33.505 --> 08:37.640
But I'm not exactly sure
about what it goes for, though,

08:37.676 --> 08:39.275
But I do know someone
who does.

08:39.311 --> 08:41.578
- Hey, Robert.
- Yeah.

08:41.613 --> 08:44.048
- You got a second?
- Sure thing.

08:44.082 --> 08:46.517
If you're on the fence about
what something's worth, man,

08:46.551 --> 08:48.919
Rob Bruce
is your spirit guide

08:48.954 --> 08:50.538
Through the world
of collectability

08:50.572 --> 08:53.457
And how not to get screwed,
price-wise, in that world.

08:53.491 --> 08:55.459
Very long title... doesn't fit
on his business card.

08:55.493 --> 08:56.660
[laughter]

08:56.695 --> 08:59.029
When Star Wars came out
in late summer,

08:59.064 --> 09:01.131
They didn't expect
the response that they got,

09:01.166 --> 09:02.900
And really they couldn't meet
the demand,

09:02.934 --> 09:04.835
So what they did
for christmas of '77

09:04.870 --> 09:07.504
- Was they sent out this packet...
- They call it "The Early Bird"?

09:07.539 --> 09:09.240
Yeah.
You could buy it at Toys R Us,

09:09.274 --> 09:11.742
Then you would mail it in
and they would send four figures

09:11.776 --> 09:17.047
To your house: Leia, Chewbacca,
R2-D2, and the original Luke.

09:17.082 --> 09:21.218
This was offered as a, like,
premium bonus with that package.

09:21.253 --> 09:22.887
What do you put
its value at?

09:22.921 --> 09:26.590
Well, that four box that they
sent you with the Early Bird,

09:26.625 --> 09:28.592
I've seen those
for 3,000 to 4,000,

09:28.627 --> 09:31.662
But there's some issues.

09:31.696 --> 09:33.063
The Han is kind of beat up.

09:33.098 --> 09:36.500
The original luke
had a telescoping lightsaber.

09:36.534 --> 09:39.870
This one is actually the normal
release with a slider.

09:39.905 --> 09:41.772
Did you buy this at a con?

09:41.806 --> 09:43.574
I honestly don't remember.
I've had that one for a while.

09:43.608 --> 09:45.342
I'm pretty sure
that this lightsaber

09:45.377 --> 09:46.844
Is a repro lightsaber.

09:46.878 --> 09:49.013
It looks like
some sort of french tickler.

09:49.047 --> 09:51.649
[laughter]
Doesn't it?

09:51.683 --> 09:54.385
You have all 12 figures.
Probably the 12 figures alone,

09:54.419 --> 09:55.886
100 bucks.

09:55.921 --> 09:58.422
- With the stand?
- The stand, a 100, 125.

09:58.456 --> 10:00.257
So you're probably
looking at 200, retail.

10:00.292 --> 10:02.226
So after hearing that,

10:02.260 --> 10:04.395
What do you think
you'd let it go for?

10:04.429 --> 10:06.030
I know you got to make
some money.

10:06.064 --> 10:08.365
Um, 170?

10:08.400 --> 10:11.635
Like you said, every dollar
counts when you own a business,

10:11.670 --> 10:15.239
So how about 125?

10:15.273 --> 10:18.042
135.

10:18.076 --> 10:21.078
How about we meet
in the middle, and we do 130?

10:21.112 --> 10:24.882
130?

10:24.916 --> 10:26.717
I could let it go for 130.

10:26.751 --> 10:27.718
- You got a deal.
- Do it.

10:27.752 --> 10:28.719
- Good deal.
- All right.

10:28.753 --> 10:30.120
- Oh, my gosh.
- Brought an old

10:30.155 --> 10:32.156
Underdog Dakin doll
from the '70s.

10:32.190 --> 10:33.357
Holy crap!

10:33.391 --> 10:35.960
Well, welcome to my Batcave,
gentlemen.

10:36.586 --> 10:38.753
You're given
a million bucks

10:38.787 --> 10:40.855
And told you can only use it
to build your own man cave.

10:40.889 --> 10:42.056
What does your man cave
look like?

10:42.090 --> 10:44.208
- What's its theme?
- Bedrock.

10:44.259 --> 10:46.260
I'd make it look
like a Flintstone house.

10:46.295 --> 10:47.979
Really?
Are you that big a fan?

10:48.030 --> 10:50.014
Yeah, and it would have, like,
the little pelican,

10:50.065 --> 10:53.134
You know, that... you know,
that I put on the record player.

10:53.168 --> 10:55.736
[laughter]

10:55.771 --> 10:58.906
- Fortress of Solitude.
- Oh, bravo!

10:58.940 --> 11:00.791
Interplanetary Zoo,
the whole nine yards.

11:00.826 --> 11:03.243
You got...
Batcave has to be top choice.

11:03.262 --> 11:05.580
Fortress of Solitude
should be number two,

11:05.614 --> 11:07.798
Man, think about it.
That is the ultimate man cave.

11:07.833 --> 11:09.050
Man of Steel cave.

11:09.084 --> 11:11.969
1 million bucks,
what is your man cave theme?

11:12.004 --> 11:14.388
- Caligula.
- Caligula?

11:14.423 --> 11:15.423
Right?

11:15.457 --> 11:16.757
Would it have
a vomitorium in it?

11:16.792 --> 11:19.760
- [laughter]
- Oh, man.

11:19.778 --> 11:22.496
People buried up to their heads
with lawnmowers coming at them.

11:22.530 --> 11:24.498
But I'd still have
a pelican phonograph.

11:24.533 --> 11:26.200
[laughter]

11:32.853 --> 11:34.520
You know
what's mystifying?

11:34.555 --> 11:37.890
Is the fact that there's guys
going out there today

11:37.925 --> 11:40.893
Dressed as superheroes,
acting like superheroes,

11:40.928 --> 11:44.264
And there's really
no mass media coverage of it.

11:44.298 --> 11:46.699
I mean, it's crazy.
To get real media attention,

11:46.734 --> 11:48.968
We need the rise
of super villains.

11:49.003 --> 11:50.536
- Villains.
- How committed are you

11:50.571 --> 11:52.305
To comics?

11:52.339 --> 11:54.073
So what,
I got to be a bad guy?

11:54.108 --> 11:56.676
Yeah, you can be...
you can be "Pip-Queak."

11:56.710 --> 11:58.144
[laughter]

11:58.178 --> 11:59.712
What kind of crimes
does he dabble in?

11:59.747 --> 12:01.881
He leaves
a little puddle of urine.

12:01.915 --> 12:03.516
[laughter]

12:03.550 --> 12:04.884
Insurance fraud.

12:04.918 --> 12:07.987
[laughter]

12:08.022 --> 12:09.856
He urinates in stores,
slips on it,

12:09.890 --> 12:11.791
And then files...
Files a claim.

12:11.825 --> 12:14.294
[laughter]

12:14.328 --> 12:18.364
Then CNN, MSNBC,
all over the news, baby.

12:18.399 --> 12:19.465
You'll be famous.

12:19.500 --> 12:21.334
- How you doing?
- Hi, guys, how you doing?

12:21.368 --> 12:22.735
- Oh, my gosh.
- Brought in

12:22.770 --> 12:24.504
An old Underdog Dakin doll
from the '70s,

12:24.538 --> 12:26.906
See if you guys
were interested in it.

12:34.248 --> 12:36.449
I am a gigantic
Underdog fan.

12:36.483 --> 12:37.817
- You remember this cartoon?
- Oh, yeah, me too.

12:37.851 --> 12:39.319
I remember Underdog,
absolutely.

12:39.353 --> 12:41.054
Yeah, he's my favorite.
I've been collecting him since,

12:41.088 --> 12:43.623
- Like, '89.
- Wow, this is nice.

12:43.657 --> 12:45.558
This is a nice box
and everything.

12:45.592 --> 12:47.126
Yeah, it's pretty rare,
you know.

12:47.161 --> 12:48.695
Dakin.
That doesn't ring a bell.

12:48.729 --> 12:50.930
I mean, I can remember
going out, you know,

12:50.964 --> 12:53.666
Shopping constantly.
I've never seen this before.

12:53.701 --> 12:55.835
Dakin's were a huge part
of my childhood.

12:55.869 --> 12:57.804
Do you remember the Perkins
Pancake House in middletown?

12:57.838 --> 12:58.905
Yeah.

12:58.939 --> 13:02.258
They had a wall
behind the register

13:02.309 --> 13:04.110
With all these
Dakin's figures.

13:04.144 --> 13:06.245
I ate a lot of sugar
as a kid,

13:06.280 --> 13:08.481
So I always had to go
to the dentist,

13:08.499 --> 13:10.266
And how they got me
to go to the dentist

13:10.300 --> 13:14.153
And sit through the drill...
The promise of a Dakin's figure

13:14.188 --> 13:16.989
At Perkins
after the dentist trip.

13:17.024 --> 13:18.991
[laughter]

13:19.026 --> 13:21.194
- What's Underdog missing?
- [laughs]

13:21.228 --> 13:22.662
He's missing his ring.

13:22.696 --> 13:24.263
Underdog would wear a ring
with a little pill in it,

13:24.298 --> 13:25.698
- I guess...
- Yeah, he was a shoeshine boy.

13:25.733 --> 13:27.066
He was a shoeshine boy,
and he would

13:27.101 --> 13:28.534
- Go into a phone booth...
- Yeah. [laughs]

13:28.569 --> 13:30.236
Turn into Underdog,
but then his powers

13:30.270 --> 13:31.671
Would kind of wane,
I guess.

13:31.705 --> 13:34.874
A lot of people say Underdog
was just a rip-off of Superman.

13:34.908 --> 13:36.409
There were
a lot of similarities.

13:36.443 --> 13:37.543
Like what?
Well, Superman

13:37.578 --> 13:39.011
- Didn't pop a pill.
- Yeah.

13:39.046 --> 13:40.346
- No, he didn't, but...
- He didn't wear a ring.

13:40.381 --> 13:41.981
Didn't he get changed
in a phone booth?

13:42.015 --> 13:43.483
- Yes. Yes.
- Yup, that's true.

13:43.517 --> 13:45.551
The phone booth
is a tough one to dispute.

13:45.586 --> 13:47.220
- [laughter]
- Yeah, right?

13:47.254 --> 13:49.756
Underdog, heavily
predicated on Superman.

13:49.790 --> 13:51.791
Sweet Polly Purebred
is Lois Lane.

13:51.825 --> 13:54.994
Simon Bar Sinister,
just like his Lex Luthor,

13:55.028 --> 13:57.330
Bald as well,
but no other super heroes

13:57.364 --> 14:00.466
That I can think of
pop a pill and become super.

14:00.501 --> 14:02.051
So what do you think
the energy pill was?

14:02.086 --> 14:05.204
- Was it methamphetamine?
- Underdog had meth mouth?

14:05.239 --> 14:07.140
Yeah, his teeth were rotting
out of his head, man.

14:07.174 --> 14:09.642
[laughter]
It was gross.

14:09.676 --> 14:11.544
So why are you looking
to sell it today?

14:11.578 --> 14:13.312
My business closed down
where I was working.

14:13.347 --> 14:15.848
Just looking to get rid
of a couple of things, you know.

14:15.883 --> 14:17.383
You don't want to become
a shoeshine boy?

14:17.418 --> 14:18.518
No, not at all.

14:18.552 --> 14:21.220
[laughter]
That is exactly right.

14:21.255 --> 14:22.955
And what are you looking
to get today for it?

14:22.990 --> 14:25.558
- I was looking for 4.
- 4 bucks? Definitely.

14:25.592 --> 14:27.727
No, 400.
[laughter]

14:27.761 --> 14:30.930
Um, would you take $200
for it?

14:30.964 --> 14:33.666
- Uh, [scoffs], nah.
- No?

14:33.700 --> 14:35.368
No, I can't do 200.

14:35.402 --> 14:37.737
I'd do 300.
I could do 300, yeah.

14:37.771 --> 14:40.239
How about 260?

14:40.274 --> 14:44.043
How about... wait.
265, is that cool?

14:44.077 --> 14:46.145
- It's only 5 more.
- It's definitely cool.

14:46.180 --> 14:47.580
Yeah?
All right, cool.

14:47.614 --> 14:48.815
- You got a deal.
- Excellent, ah, great.

14:48.849 --> 14:51.617
- Thanks, man.
- Thanks, thank you.

14:51.652 --> 14:52.852
- All right, 265, man.
- All right, great.

14:52.886 --> 14:54.053
- I hope it helps.
- All right, great.

14:54.087 --> 14:55.354
- Thanks, guys.
- All right, have a great day.

14:55.389 --> 14:56.622
- See you later, take care.
- See you later.

14:56.657 --> 14:58.658
Bye-bye.

15:02.763 --> 15:04.464
This is it, huh?

15:04.498 --> 15:05.832
It's awesome.

15:05.866 --> 15:07.633
Doesn't look
like Wayne Manor though.

15:07.668 --> 15:09.669
So this guy let us
come out to Delaware

15:09.703 --> 15:11.671
- And see his Batcave.
- No way.

15:11.705 --> 15:13.322
We had to wear blindfolds
when we went in.

15:13.357 --> 15:15.675
[laughter]

15:15.709 --> 15:17.142
Yeah, yeah, he sprayed us
with the bat...

15:17.161 --> 15:18.177
The little...
That little "psst."

15:18.212 --> 15:20.913
Uhh.
[laughter]

15:22.249 --> 15:25.151
- "Pick up walkie."
- That's kind of weird.

15:25.185 --> 15:27.954
- Should I pick it up?
- Yeah.

15:28.956 --> 15:30.590
Hit the button.

15:30.624 --> 15:31.824
- Is that how you use a walkie?
- Yeah, it...

15:31.859 --> 15:33.292
Good morning, gentlemen.

15:33.327 --> 15:36.229
I see you found the place
all right.

15:36.263 --> 15:39.165
- [eerie music]
- Yeah, is this Chris?

15:39.199 --> 15:41.834
[static]

15:41.869 --> 15:45.104
Please enter the house,
walk straight ahead,

15:45.138 --> 15:49.509
And proceed down the staircase
on your right.

15:49.543 --> 15:52.879
And at this point you run,
because that's horrifying.

15:52.913 --> 15:55.598
That is how a horror movie
begins.

15:55.632 --> 15:57.449
You read that in a newspaper,
you're just like,

15:57.467 --> 16:01.020
"And these idiots went inside?"
[laughter]

16:01.054 --> 16:03.789
Next beat is,
"I've chained you to a radiator.

16:03.824 --> 16:06.526
Here's a hacksaw, there's only
one way to the key."

16:06.560 --> 16:08.594
Yeah.
[laughter]

16:08.629 --> 16:10.630
You know what,
any dude that builds a Batcave

16:10.664 --> 16:13.966
Is definitely into theatrics,
right?

16:14.001 --> 16:15.801
I'm going in.

16:15.836 --> 16:17.336
- Can't help yourself?
- You're just gonna go in?

16:17.371 --> 16:18.671
- Yeah, go ahead.
- I'm not going first.

16:18.705 --> 16:19.705
- You go first.
- Just go on!

16:19.740 --> 16:21.741
Go on.
[laughter]

16:24.044 --> 16:27.280
- Check it out, man.
- Wow.

16:27.314 --> 16:29.315
Welcome to my Batcave,
gentlemen.

16:29.349 --> 16:30.349
I didn't think
you actually

16:30.384 --> 16:32.485
- Had a real cave.
- [laughs]

16:39.112 --> 16:40.445
Whoa.

16:40.480 --> 16:42.180
This is weird.
Where is everybody?

16:42.215 --> 16:45.150
You left the car running, right?
In case we gotta go?

16:45.184 --> 16:47.185
Like, it feels weird, like,
wandering around this house.

16:47.220 --> 16:48.887
- [laughs]
- Just go to the bottom

16:48.921 --> 16:51.423
Of the stairs and let us know
how it works out for you.

16:51.457 --> 16:54.092
You're in this man's house,
but you still haven't seen him?

16:54.126 --> 16:56.561
No, I mean, no sign of life
at all in this house.

16:56.596 --> 16:57.963
Why did he have to be
all creepy like that?

16:57.997 --> 16:59.564
Why can't we just
ring the doorbell,

16:59.599 --> 17:01.983
"Hey, welcome to my house.
Come see my Batcave."

17:02.018 --> 17:04.502
- Why can't it be like that?
- He's a bat fan, man,

17:04.520 --> 17:05.837
And what do we know
about Batman?

17:05.855 --> 17:09.674
"Theatricality and deception
are powerful agents."

17:09.709 --> 17:10.876
[laughter]

17:12.078 --> 17:16.481
Look at all this Batman stuff.
It's nuts.

17:16.516 --> 17:18.049
- Check it out, man.
- Wow.

17:18.084 --> 17:20.652
This is some setup.

17:20.685 --> 17:24.656
This is the creme de la creme
of man caves, man.

17:24.690 --> 17:26.892
Do we even have this much
Batman stuff in the store?

17:26.925 --> 17:28.425
- No.
- Huh.

17:28.461 --> 17:30.562
Check this out, bro.
He's got good taste.

17:30.596 --> 17:33.598
[laughter, chatter]

17:34.700 --> 17:36.067
Want to see
some more, man.

17:36.102 --> 17:37.702
Harley Quinn,
Poison Ivy.

17:37.737 --> 17:39.471
Look at the little bat
vehicles.

17:39.505 --> 17:42.107
- Batman TV Show Batmobile.
- Got a tumbler.

17:42.141 --> 17:45.310
Holy crap!
This dude's bat crazy.

17:45.344 --> 17:47.646
I think there's a word
in between "bat" and "crazy"

17:47.680 --> 17:48.947
That you should
throw in there.

17:48.981 --> 17:50.982
[laughter]

17:51.017 --> 17:52.050
[over walkie-talkie]
Gentlemen,

17:52.084 --> 17:54.986
I see you're enjoying yourselves
so far.

17:55.021 --> 17:56.788
You think
he's watching us?

17:56.823 --> 17:59.558
If you turn around,
you'll see a grandfather clock

17:59.592 --> 18:01.493
With a bust
of William Shakespeare's head

18:01.527 --> 18:03.295
Beside it.

18:03.329 --> 18:05.463
I assume you know
what to do with that.

18:05.498 --> 18:07.799
- Now it's getting really weird.
- Lift it up.

18:07.834 --> 18:09.267
All right.

18:10.770 --> 18:13.171
There's a button
right there.

18:13.206 --> 18:14.940
Press it.

18:16.876 --> 18:19.878
Holy crap!

18:19.912 --> 18:23.014
All right, my blue canary,
after you.

18:23.049 --> 18:25.617
Come on.

18:25.651 --> 18:28.153
- Holy crap!
- Whoa.

18:28.187 --> 18:30.755
Welcome to my Batcave,
gentlemen.

18:30.790 --> 18:33.758
[exciting music]

18:33.793 --> 18:39.364
âª

18:39.398 --> 18:41.166
Holy crap!

18:41.200 --> 18:44.269
I didn't think you actually had
a real cave, though.

18:44.303 --> 18:47.405
A Christian Bale batsuit
is on display, lit.

18:47.440 --> 18:48.807
- No!
- Yes.

18:48.841 --> 18:51.042
There's rock formations.
There's a batarang.

18:51.077 --> 18:53.879
It was literally like
we were on the set

18:53.913 --> 18:55.747
Of a Chris Nolan Batman film.

18:55.781 --> 18:58.183
It is the dopest thing
you've ever seen, man.

18:58.217 --> 18:59.751
You're not really Batman,
are you?

18:59.785 --> 19:01.253
I wish I was.

19:01.287 --> 19:04.556
The suit's a replica
of the costume worn

19:04.590 --> 19:06.524
In the Dark Knight
and The Dark Knight Rises.

19:06.559 --> 19:07.959
- Do you ever put this on?
- You know,

19:07.994 --> 19:10.629
I really wanted to,
but I don't quite fit into it.

19:10.663 --> 19:13.064
Oh, man, I would work out
until I fit into that thing.

19:13.099 --> 19:15.200
- [laughs]
- There's the DX12.

19:15.234 --> 19:17.769
Oh, yeah, I couldn't wait
to bring that bad boy home

19:17.803 --> 19:19.471
And set him up.
Proudly displayed him

19:19.505 --> 19:20.972
Right on the edge
of my desk there.

19:21.007 --> 19:22.407
What was the inspiration?
Were you just like,

19:22.441 --> 19:25.911
"Hey, I'm bored, I want to build
the ultimate Batcave."

19:25.945 --> 19:28.780
The Batman Begins movie
kind of inspired me.

19:28.814 --> 19:31.683
I wanted to lay it out
as if Batman was operating

19:31.717 --> 19:32.851
Right out of this room.

19:32.885 --> 19:34.953
On a weekly basis,
how much time is spent

19:34.987 --> 19:36.254
Down here in your Batcave?

19:36.289 --> 19:38.924
Probably 75 to 80%
of my time.

19:38.958 --> 19:42.177
Oh, Lord, man.
With his family, I hope.

19:42.211 --> 19:44.562
Or are they all pounding
on that clock?

19:44.597 --> 19:45.931
[laughter]

19:45.965 --> 19:48.033
The room doubles
as a home theater,

19:48.067 --> 19:52.103
Complete with a front projector
and a 120-inch screen.

19:52.138 --> 19:55.073
- 120 inches?
- Follow me.

19:58.444 --> 20:00.779
It feels like we're sitting
in God's hands.

20:00.813 --> 20:02.280
[laughs]

20:02.315 --> 20:04.416
There's a power button
on the inside of the armrest

20:04.450 --> 20:05.617
If you want to recline.

20:05.651 --> 20:07.919
Ohh...
[laughter]

20:07.954 --> 20:09.020
[laughs]

20:09.055 --> 20:10.021
- Oh, my God.
- [laughs]

20:10.056 --> 20:11.623
Ohh, man.

20:11.657 --> 20:13.325
Thank you, Chris.

20:13.359 --> 20:14.960
- Thank you for coming down.
- I can't thank you enough.

20:14.994 --> 20:16.494
I can tell you guys
enjoyed yourself,

20:16.529 --> 20:20.799
But the pleasure was,
really, all mine.

20:22.134 --> 20:24.669
For God's sake, get up.
Let's go.

20:24.704 --> 20:26.671
It's so hard.

20:26.706 --> 20:28.256
I think it's important
for everybody

20:28.291 --> 20:29.791
To have their own space

20:29.842 --> 20:32.344
And call it
their man cave or Batcave.

20:32.378 --> 20:35.046
You know, we all had
a playroom when we were kids,

20:35.081 --> 20:37.299
And then when you get older,
you get the whole house,

20:37.333 --> 20:39.301
But you still need
a little space of your own.

20:39.335 --> 20:42.352
Trade out the action figures
for probably being online,

20:42.353 --> 20:43.653
maybe looking at porn.

20:43.654 --> 20:45.254
[laughs]

20:45.255 --> 20:48.355
And that's it, all temp was
a turntable and five microphones.

20:48.356 --> 20:50.056
We got this jam wraped up, folks.

20:50.057 --> 20:51.857
We're Comic Book Men,
I'm your host, Kevin Smith.

20:51.858 --> 20:53.758
- Bryan Johnson.
- Walt Flanagan.

20:53.759 --> 20:55.159
- Mike Zapcic.
- Ming Chen.

20:55.160 --> 20:57.160
Always let the wookie win, kids.

20:57.161 --> 20:58.561
Good night.
