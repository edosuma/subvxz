03:25.330 --> 03:28.930
Mod f-x-square, d-x.

03:30.730 --> 03:34.130
So please finish Percival
for next time.

03:34.210 --> 03:39.330
I know many of you had this as
undergraduates, but it won't hurt to brush up.

03:41.690 --> 03:44.730
Thank you, Steven.

03:44.810 --> 03:49.450
I also put an advanced Fourier system
on the main hallway chalkboard.

03:49.530 --> 03:52.210
I'm hoping that one of you might
prove it by the end of the semester.

03:52.290 --> 03:55.130
Now the person to do so will
not only be in my good graces...

03:55.210 --> 03:58.170
but also go on
to fame and fortune...

03:58.250 --> 04:01.210
by having their accomplishment
recorded and their name printed...

04:01.290 --> 04:03.250
in the auspicious M.I.T. Tech.

04:03.330 --> 04:07.650
Former winners include Nobel laureates,
Field's medal winners...

04:07.730 --> 04:12.250
renowned astrophysicists
and lowly M.I.T. professors.

04:12.330 --> 04:15.570
Well, that's all.
If you have any questions...

04:15.650 --> 04:18.970
I'm sure that Tom
has the answers.

04:52.690 --> 04:54.850
Hi, Will.

04:54.930 --> 04:56.850
- Kirsten, how you doing?
- I'm all right. How are you?

04:56.930 --> 04:59.970
- Good.
- I didn't get on Cathy last night.

05:00.050 --> 05:01.210
- No?
- No.

05:01.250 --> 05:02.690
- Why not?
- I don't know.

05:02.730 --> 05:04.930
- Cathy!
- What?

05:05.010 --> 05:07.370
Why didn't you give me none of that
nasty little hoochie-woochie...

05:07.450 --> 05:09.690
- you usually throw at me?
- Oh, fuck you...

05:09.730 --> 05:12.050
and your Irish curse,
Chuckie.

05:12.130 --> 05:15.890
Like I'd waste my energy spreadin'
my legs for that Tootsie Roll dick?

05:15.970 --> 05:19.210
- Go home and give it a tug yourself.
- Tootsie Roll!

05:19.290 --> 05:21.210
T- Toots!

05:21.250 --> 05:24.410
She's missin' a tooth,
Will.

05:24.450 --> 05:27.330
She's got skin problems.
I don't-

05:27.370 --> 05:30.330
Plus, it's like 5-to-2 Morgan ends up
marryin' her, you know what I mean?

05:30.410 --> 05:32.890
There's only so many times you can
bang your friend's future wife.

05:32.970 --> 05:35.450
It's wrong.
Where you goin'?

05:35.490 --> 05:39.810
- I'm gonna take off.
- Fuck you, you're takin' off. It's, like, what, 10:00?

05:39.890 --> 05:42.010
No, I'm tired.

05:44.250 --> 05:46.090
Irish curse?

05:46.170 --> 05:48.930
She don't know.
There ain't no Irish curse.

06:53.770 --> 06:56.330
Out! Stop
pressuring me back.

06:56.410 --> 07:00.410
Stop crowding the plate!
Which one will it be?

07:02.810 --> 07:04.930
You're gonna get charged,
you know that?

07:05.010 --> 07:08.370
You think I'm afraid of you, you big
fuck? You're crowdin' the fuckin' plate.

07:08.450 --> 07:12.810
Hey, uh, Casey's bouncin' up a bar at
Harvard next week. We should go up there.

07:12.890 --> 07:14.970
- What are we gonna do up there?
- I don't know.

07:15.010 --> 07:18.890
We'll fuck up some smart kids.
Probably fit right in.

07:20.690 --> 07:23.290
Ow! Fuckin' punk.

07:23.330 --> 07:27.450
- Oh, what's up? You still tough?
- Come on!

07:27.530 --> 07:29.290
Come on. Come on.
That's it.

07:31.010 --> 07:35.810
% I'd hold you forever
here %

07:35.890 --> 07:39.370
% In my arms %

07:39.450 --> 07:41.290
- Professor Lambeau?
- Yes?

07:41.370 --> 07:44.610
I'm in your applied theories class. We're
all up at the math and science building.

07:44.690 --> 07:48.690
Come here. It's Saturday.

07:48.770 --> 07:52.050
- Unless you wanna have a drink with me tonight.
- Maybe.

07:52.130 --> 07:54.090
We just couldn't wait
until Monday to find out.

07:54.170 --> 07:57.690
- Find out what?
- Who proved the theorem.

08:17.970 --> 08:22.490
This is correct.
Who did this?

08:22.570 --> 08:24.770
- Jack?
- It wasn't me.

08:24.850 --> 08:27.450
- Nemesh?
- N-No way.

08:31.330 --> 08:34.010
- Come on, Joey, now!
- Billy, McNamara's up.

08:34.049 --> 08:36.409
Come on, kid!

08:36.450 --> 08:38.570
- Joey, dig it out! Dig it out!
- Son of a bitch!

08:38.650 --> 08:42.049
Bring it down, Mac! That's how to
do it! Attaboy! Take two, Mac.

08:44.770 --> 08:49.290
Hey, Morgan, who's the girl with the
striped pants? She's got a nice ass.

08:49.370 --> 08:52.250
Yeah, that's a real nice ass.
- Who's the guy she's with?

08:52.290 --> 08:55.450
That fuckin' guinea. I hate that
little bitch. Will knows him.

08:55.530 --> 08:58.050
Yeah, I do.
Yeah, fuckin' Carmine Scarpaglia.

08:58.130 --> 09:00.930
- That guy used to beat the shit out of me in kindergarten.
- That guy?

09:01.010 --> 09:03.130
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

09:03.210 --> 09:05.690
Fuck this.
Let's get some food.

09:05.730 --> 09:09.730
- Oh, what, Morgan, you're not gonna go talk to her?
- Fuck her.

09:09.810 --> 09:12.130
- I could go for a Whopper.
- Let's go to Kelly's.

09:12.170 --> 09:15.130
Morgan, I'm not goin' to Kelly's just
'cause you like the take-out girl.

09:15.210 --> 09:19.330
- It's 15 minutes out of our way.
- What the fuck are we gonna do? We can't spare 15 minutes?

09:21.690 --> 09:23.530
Double burger.

09:25.050 --> 09:26.970
Double burger.

09:27.050 --> 09:29.890
Chuck, I had
a double burger.

09:29.970 --> 09:32.970
Would you shut the fuck up!
I know what you ordered. I was there.

09:33.050 --> 09:35.930
- So give me my fuckin' sandwich.
- What do you mean, your sandwich? I bought it.

09:36.010 --> 09:37.730
Morgan, how much money
you got on you?

09:37.810 --> 09:40.450
I said I'd get change
when I get the snow cone.

09:40.530 --> 09:43.850
I said that when we pulled up. Give me
my sandwich and stop bein' a prick.

09:43.930 --> 09:46.890
All right, well, give me your fuckin'
16 cents that you got on you now.

09:46.970 --> 09:51.170
We'll put your fuckin' sandwich on layaway.
Here we go. Keep it right up here for ya.

09:51.250 --> 09:53.770
We'll put you on a program. Every day
you come in here with your six cents.

09:53.850 --> 09:56.890
- At the end of the week, you get your sandwich.
- Are you gonna be an asshole?

09:56.970 --> 10:01.050
What am I, fuckin' sandwich welfare? I think
you should establish a good line of credit.

10:01.090 --> 10:03.770
Like how you bought
your couch- payment plans.

10:03.810 --> 10:06.970
Remember how your mother brought in
ten dollars every day for a year.

10:07.010 --> 10:08.890
She finally got her couch
Rent-A-Center style.

10:08.930 --> 10:12.090
- Can I have my food, please?
- Here's your fuckin' double burger.

10:13.770 --> 10:16.130
- Whoa!
- Hey, hold up, Chuck.

10:16.210 --> 10:18.490
- Slow it down.
- Who do we got?

10:18.530 --> 10:20.410
- I don't know yet.
- Hey, douche bag!

10:20.450 --> 10:22.890
Yeah, you, you skank face!

10:22.970 --> 10:27.290
- Shut the fuck up. - Get outta
here. - What are you worried about?

10:27.330 --> 10:29.210
Why don't you lick
my love stick?

10:29.250 --> 10:34.090
We seen the guy 15 minutes ago. We should've
fight him then. We're eatin' our snacks now.

10:34.170 --> 10:36.130
- Shut up, Morgan, you're goin'.
- I'm not goin'. - So don't go.

10:36.210 --> 10:39.850
- I'm not goin'.
- Fuckin' go, Morgan.

10:39.930 --> 10:42.290
Let me tell you somethin'. If you're not
out there in two fuckin' seconds,

10:42.370 --> 10:44.130
when I'm done with them,
you're next.

10:44.210 --> 10:48.130
Carmine, it's me, Will. Remember,
we went to kindergarten together.

10:48.210 --> 10:51.490
% Way down the street
there's a light in his place %

10:51.570 --> 10:55.450
- % He opens the door, he's
got that look on his face %%

11:01.850 --> 11:05.210
- Fuckin', let's go, man.
- Step on his fuckin' head.

11:05.250 --> 11:09.050
Get his ass on the ground.
Stop that motherfucker.

11:15.250 --> 11:17.050
Motherfucker, die!

11:17.090 --> 11:20.290
- Carter!
- Come on!

11:30.530 --> 11:34.650
Will! Will, come on!

11:34.690 --> 11:38.050
Will, come on.
Let's go. Let's go.

11:39.170 --> 11:41.210
Easy, brother, easy.

11:41.250 --> 11:44.570
- Hey, fellas, thanks for comin' out.
- Come here!

11:44.650 --> 11:46.050
Whoa! Whoa!

11:51.570 --> 11:53.050
Ah. Fuck.

11:59.970 --> 12:04.170
Is it just my imagination,
or has my class grown considerably?

12:04.250 --> 12:07.170
Well, by no stretch
of my imagination...

12:07.250 --> 12:09.730
do I believe you've all come here
to hear me lecture.

12:09.810 --> 12:14.410
Rather, to ascertain the identity
of the mystery math magician.

12:14.490 --> 12:19.250
So without further adieu, come forward,
silent rogue, and receive thy prize.

12:29.050 --> 12:33.330
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint
my spectators, but...

12:33.410 --> 12:36.050
it seems there will be
no unmasking here today.

12:36.130 --> 12:40.090
However, uh, my colleagues and I
have conferred,

12:40.170 --> 12:42.650
and there is a problem
on the board right now...

12:42.730 --> 12:45.850
that took us
more than two years to prove.

12:45.890 --> 12:49.450
So let this be said:
The gauntlet has been thrown down,

12:49.530 --> 12:53.370
but the faculty have answered
and answered with vigor.

13:05.570 --> 13:07.450
Hey, when's the arraignment?

13:07.530 --> 13:09.410
Next week.

13:33.250 --> 13:35.890
Sorry.

13:35.970 --> 13:37.890
- What are you doing?
- Sorry.

13:39.490 --> 13:41.730
That's people's work.
You can't graffiti here.

13:41.810 --> 13:44.410
- Don't you walk away from me!
- Hey, fuck you!

13:44.490 --> 13:47.450
Oh, you're a clever one.
What's your name?

14:08.930 --> 14:10.810
Oh, my God.

14:17.210 --> 14:19.050
Looks right.

14:33.930 --> 14:37.090
Will, how retarded do you gotta be
to get fired from that job?

14:37.170 --> 14:39.770
I mean, how hard is it
to push a motherfuckin' broom around?

14:39.850 --> 14:41.810
Mitch, you got fired
from pushin' a fuckin' broom.

14:41.890 --> 14:44.130
I got fired 'cause
management was restructuring.

14:44.210 --> 14:46.810
Yeah, restructuring the amount
of retards they had workin' for 'em.

14:46.890 --> 14:49.050
Shut up. You get canned
more than tuna, bitch.

14:49.130 --> 14:52.330
At least I got a motherfuckin' job
right now, don't I?

14:52.410 --> 14:57.810
- Why'd you get fired, Will? Come on.
- Management was restructuring.

14:57.890 --> 15:00.290
- My uncle could probably get you on a demo team.
- Can he do that?

15:00.370 --> 15:02.810
You kiddin' me! I asked you
yesterday if I could get a job.

15:02.890 --> 15:04.770
And I told you "no"
yesterday.

15:04.850 --> 15:07.330
- What's up, Casey? - What's
up, Case? - What's up, Big Case?

15:10.130 --> 15:13.090
Let's sit over here.

15:13.170 --> 15:15.010
All right. Let's go.

15:19.410 --> 15:22.850
Oh, this is- this is
a Harvard bar, huh?

15:22.930 --> 15:25.170
I thought there'd be, like,
equations and shit on the wall.

15:27.050 --> 15:30.650
I will take a pitcher
of the finest lager in the house.

15:37.250 --> 15:41.330
Timeout. I'm gonna have to bust a little move
on them Harvard hotties down there at the bar.

15:41.410 --> 15:45.170
- Work some magic.
- Get some potion for us.

15:59.330 --> 16:02.490
- Oh, hello.
- Oh, hello.

16:02.570 --> 16:04.610
- Hi. How are ya?
- Fine.

16:04.690 --> 16:06.570
- So, do you ladies, uh-
- Come here often?

16:06.650 --> 16:08.450
Do I come here?
I come here a bit.

16:08.530 --> 16:11.490
I'm here, you know,
from time to time.

16:11.570 --> 16:13.890
- Do you go to school here?
- Yep.

16:13.930 --> 16:18.970
- Yeah, that's it. I think I had a class with you.
- Oh, yeah. What class?

16:19.050 --> 16:20.930
- History.
- Maybe.

16:20.970 --> 16:22.890
Yes, I think
that's what it was.

16:22.970 --> 16:26.410
You don't necessarily- may not
remember me. You know, I like it here.

16:26.490 --> 16:30.410
- It doesn't mean 'cause I go here, I'm a genius. I am very smart.
- Hey.

16:30.490 --> 16:32.250
- Hey, how's it goin'? How are ya?
- Good. How ya doin'?

16:32.290 --> 16:34.810
What class
did you say that was?

16:34.850 --> 16:36.730
- History.
- Yeah.

16:36.770 --> 16:40.170
Just history? It must have been
a survey course then.

16:40.250 --> 16:42.090
- Yeah, it was. It was surveys.
- Right.

16:42.170 --> 16:44.410
You should check it out. It's a good
course. It'd be a good class.

16:44.490 --> 16:48.890
- How'd you like that course?
- You know, frankly,

16:48.930 --> 16:51.530
- I found that class, you know, rather elementary.
- Elementary.

16:51.610 --> 16:53.450
- You know, I don't doubt that it was.
- Yeah.

16:53.530 --> 16:56.410
I, uh,
I remember that class.

16:56.490 --> 16:59.850
It was, um-
It was just between recess and lunch.

16:59.930 --> 17:02.330
Clark, why don't you
go away?

17:02.410 --> 17:04.890
- Why don't you relax?
- Why don't you go away?

17:04.930 --> 17:07.369
- I'm just havin' fun with my new friend.
- Are we gonna have a problem?

17:07.450 --> 17:10.010
No, no, no, no.
There's no problem here.

17:10.050 --> 17:13.369
I was just hoping you might give me
some insight into the evolution...

17:13.450 --> 17:16.490
of the market economy
in the southern colonies.

17:16.569 --> 17:21.810
My contention is that prior to the
Revolutionary War, the economic modalities-

17:21.890 --> 17:24.530
especially
in the southern colonies-

17:24.609 --> 17:27.130
could most aptly
be characterized as...

17:27.170 --> 17:29.050
- agrarian precapitalist.
- Let me tell you somethin'.

17:29.090 --> 17:31.330
Of course that's your contention.
You're a first-year grad student.

17:31.410 --> 17:35.330
You just got finished readin' some
Marxian historian- Pete Garrison, probably-

17:35.410 --> 17:37.490
You're gonna be convinced of that till
next month when you get to James Lemon.

17:37.570 --> 17:40.490
Then you're gonna be talkin' about how the
economies of Virginia and Pennsylvania...

17:40.570 --> 17:43.570
were entrepreneurial
and capitalist way back in 1740.

17:43.650 --> 17:46.890
That's gonna last until next year. You're
gonna be in here regurgitatin' Gordon Wood,

17:46.970 --> 17:49.890
talkin' about, you know,
the prerevolutionary utopia...

17:49.970 --> 17:52.850
and the capital-forming effects
of military mobilization.

17:52.930 --> 17:55.130
Well,
as a matter of fact, I won't,

17:55.210 --> 17:58.330
because Wood drastically
underestimates the impact of-

17:58.410 --> 18:01.690
Wood drastically underestimates
the impact of social distinctions...

18:01.730 --> 18:04.890
predicated upon wealth,
especially inherited wealth.

18:04.930 --> 18:09.010
You got that from Vickers'
Work in Essex County. Page 98, right?

18:09.090 --> 18:11.570
I read that too. Were you gonna
plagiarize the whole thing for us?

18:11.650 --> 18:15.090
Do you have any thoughts
of your own on this matter?

18:15.170 --> 18:18.170
Or is that your thing? You come into
a bar. You read some obscure passage.

18:18.210 --> 18:20.970
Then pretend-
pawn it off as your own.

18:21.050 --> 18:24.530
As your own idea just to impress
some girls? Embarrass my friend?

18:24.610 --> 18:28.090
See, the sad thing about a guy like
you is, in 50 years,

18:28.170 --> 18:30.050
you're gonna start doin'
some thinkin' on your own.

18:30.090 --> 18:32.690
You're gonna come up with the fact that
there are two certainties in life.

18:32.770 --> 18:34.410
One: Don't do that.

18:34.490 --> 18:37.370
And two: You dropped 150 grand
on a fuckin' education...

18:37.450 --> 18:40.330
you could've got for $1.50
in late charges at the public library.

18:42.530 --> 18:44.930
Yeah, but
I will have a degree,

18:45.010 --> 18:50.050
and you'll be servin' my kids fries at a
drive through on our way to a skiing trip.

18:50.130 --> 18:53.010
Maybe, but at least
I won't be unoriginal.

18:53.090 --> 18:57.530
If you have a problem with that, we could
step outside. We could figure it out.

18:57.610 --> 19:01.650
No, man, there's no problem.
It's cool.

19:01.730 --> 19:03.570
- It's cool?
- Yeah.

19:03.650 --> 19:06.450
- Cool.
- Damn right, it's cool.

19:06.530 --> 19:08.850
How do you like me now?

19:11.650 --> 19:13.930
My boy's wicked smart.

19:14.010 --> 19:17.730
I just spent three minutes in this
fuckin' place and run into a barney, huh?

19:19.690 --> 19:21.490
There it is.

19:21.610 --> 19:23.450
- Nice to meet you.
- They were fine, man.

19:23.490 --> 19:28.170
I was gonna close the deal, but then
Chuck- Billy insulted one of 'em-

19:28.250 --> 19:31.650
The heavyset girl said I had a receding
hairline, and I was a few pounds overweight.

19:31.730 --> 19:33.570
And I was, like,
"Go fuck yourself. "

19:34.610 --> 19:36.450
I swallowed a bug.

19:37.490 --> 19:39.490
Hi.

19:39.570 --> 19:42.370
- You're an idiot.
- What?

19:42.450 --> 19:44.410
You're an idiot. I've been sitting
over there for 45 minutes...

19:44.490 --> 19:46.330
waiting for you
to come and talk to me.

19:46.410 --> 19:48.890
But I'm tired now,
and I have to go home.

19:48.970 --> 19:51.450
I couldn't sit there anymore
waiting for you.

19:51.530 --> 19:53.370
- I'm Will.
- Skylar.

19:53.450 --> 19:55.290
- Skylar.
- Oh, and by the way,

19:55.370 --> 19:58.530
that guy over there-
Michael Bolton clone-

19:58.610 --> 20:00.490
He wasn't sitting with us,
so to speak.

20:00.570 --> 20:03.770
- I know. I kinda got that impression.
- Good. Okay.

20:03.810 --> 20:05.690
Well, I've got to go.

20:05.770 --> 20:09.850
Gotta get up early and waste some more
money on my overpriced education.

20:09.930 --> 20:12.010
- No, I didn't mean you.
- That's all right.

20:12.090 --> 20:15.570
There's my number. Maybe we can
go out for coffee sometime.

20:15.610 --> 20:19.130
All right, yeah. Maybe we can just get
together and eat a bunch of caramels.

20:19.210 --> 20:21.050
- What do you mean?
- When you think about it,

20:21.130 --> 20:25.810
- it's as arbitrary as drinkin' coffee.
- Oh. Yeah. Okay.

20:25.850 --> 20:28.770
Uh, right, then.

20:28.850 --> 20:32.250
Oh, come on. You're kidding.

20:34.650 --> 20:36.490
Yo!

20:36.570 --> 20:38.370
- Fuck you, bitch!
- Fuck you.

20:38.450 --> 20:41.970
- There goes them fuckin' barneys right now with his skiin' trip.
- Hold on.

20:42.050 --> 20:44.410
We should've beat
that old bitch's ass.

20:51.250 --> 20:53.210
Do you like apples?

20:54.490 --> 20:56.330
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

20:57.850 --> 21:01.330
Well, I got her number!
How do you like them apples?

21:05.290 --> 21:10.610
% We arrived tonight %

21:10.690 --> 21:16.050
% The miles were over me %

21:16.130 --> 21:21.210
% I turned off the light %

21:22.250 --> 21:26.050
% So, come on, night %

21:29.690 --> 21:32.490
% Everyone who's gone %

21:35.290 --> 21:38.810
% Home to oblivion %

21:40.010 --> 21:45.330
% So come home %

21:45.370 --> 21:49.810
% So come on by %%

21:51.610 --> 21:53.490
Come.

21:57.010 --> 22:00.770
Excuse me? Is this
the Buildings and Grounds office?

22:00.850 --> 22:03.130
Yeah. What can I do
for you?

22:03.170 --> 22:05.170
I just need the name
of a student who works here.

22:05.210 --> 22:07.570
- No students work for me.
- Could you please check?

22:07.610 --> 22:09.690
I have this guy
who works in my building.

22:09.770 --> 22:12.090
- He's about this high.
- Which one is your building?

22:12.170 --> 22:14.970
- Two.
- Two. Building two.

22:20.530 --> 22:22.810
- Look, if anything was stolen, I should know about it.
- No, it's nothing like that.

22:22.850 --> 22:24.970
I just need his name.

22:25.050 --> 22:28.770
- I can't give you his name unless you have a complaint.
- This is Professor Lambeau.

22:28.850 --> 22:30.770
And this is
Professor Hayes.

22:30.850 --> 22:32.730
Tom, please.

22:35.370 --> 22:38.690
This is important.
Please.

22:38.770 --> 22:40.890
Will didn't show
for work today.

22:40.970 --> 22:44.450
Got this job through
his P.O. You can call him.

22:44.530 --> 22:48.370
- P.O.?
- Yeah. Parole officer.

22:52.250 --> 22:54.130
Thank you.

22:55.130 --> 22:57.170
Asshole.

22:59.170 --> 23:04.290
There is a lengthy legal precedent,
Your Honor, going back to 1789,

23:04.370 --> 23:07.330
whereby a defendant can claim self-defense
against an agent of the government...

23:07.410 --> 23:10.650
if that act is deemed a defense against
tyranny, a defense of liberty.

23:10.730 --> 23:12.770
Your Honor, Henry Ward Beecher,

23:12.850 --> 23:16.450
- in Proverbs from the Plymouth
Pulpit, 1887, said, quote- - 1887?

23:16.530 --> 23:18.290
- Excuse me.
- This is the 20th century.

23:18.330 --> 23:22.410
- He's gonna make a mockery.
- I am afforded the right to speak in my own defense, sir,

23:22.490 --> 23:25.090
by the Constitution
of the United States.

23:25.170 --> 23:26.930
- Don't tell me about the Constitution.
- This guarantees my liberty.

23:26.970 --> 23:29.370
"Liberty," in case you've forgotten,
is a soul's right to breathe.

23:29.450 --> 23:31.890
When it cannot take a long breath,
laws are girded too tight.

23:31.930 --> 23:34.130
- Without liberty, man is a syncope.
- Man is a what?

23:34.210 --> 23:37.250
- Ibid., Your Honor.
- Son, my turn.

23:37.330 --> 23:41.810
I've been sitting here for ten minutes
now lookin' over this rap sheet of yours.

23:41.890 --> 23:45.730
I just can't believe it.
June '93, assault.

23:45.810 --> 23:47.810
September '93, assault.

23:47.890 --> 23:51.330
Grand theft auto,
February of '94.

23:51.410 --> 23:55.450
Where, apparently, you defended yourself
and had the case thrown out by citing...

23:55.530 --> 23:59.570
"free property rights
of horse and carriage" from 1798.

23:59.610 --> 24:03.090
Joke. January '95,
impersonating an officer.

24:03.130 --> 24:06.930
Mayhem, theft, resisting.
All overturned.

24:07.010 --> 24:10.810
I'm also aware that you've been
through several foster homes.

24:10.850 --> 24:14.650
The state removed you from three
because of serious physical abuse.

24:14.690 --> 24:18.970
You know, another judge might care,
but you hit a cop. You're going in.

24:19.010 --> 24:22.330
Motion to dismiss is denied.
$50,000 bail.

24:22.410 --> 24:23.930
Thank you.

24:24.010 --> 24:25.490
Rise.

24:28.050 --> 24:30.010
- Hello?
- Uh, Skylar?

24:30.090 --> 24:32.130
- Yep.
- Hey, uh, it's Will.

24:32.210 --> 24:33.810
- Who?
- It's Will.

24:33.890 --> 24:36.850
You know, the really funny, good-looking
guy you met at the bar the other night.

24:36.930 --> 24:40.410
I don't recall meeting anyone who matches
that description. I think I'd remember.

24:40.490 --> 24:43.810
Oh, all right, you got me. It's the
ugly, obnoxious, toothless loser...

24:43.890 --> 24:45.730
who got hammered and wouldn't
leave you alone all night.

24:45.810 --> 24:49.770
Oh, Will! I remember.

24:49.850 --> 24:53.010
How are you?
I was wondering if you'd call me.

24:53.050 --> 24:54.930
- Yeah, look, I was wondering-
- Yo, what's up, baby?

24:54.970 --> 24:58.930
- Hold on one second.
- What you doing? Want some of my ass?

24:59.010 --> 25:02.450
- Herve, I remember you from juvi. How you doing?
- What you doing?

25:02.530 --> 25:04.770
Oh, yeah,
sorry about that.

25:04.850 --> 25:07.490
I was wonderin' maybe we could
get together sometime this week.

25:07.570 --> 25:11.330
- Sit out at a cafe. Maybe have some caramels.
- Oh, that sounds wonderful.

25:11.410 --> 25:14.090
- Yeah?
- Yeah, sure. Where are you?

25:14.170 --> 25:17.010
Uh, well, actually,
this is just a shot in the dark,

25:17.090 --> 25:21.170
but, uh, there's no chance
that you're pre-law, is there?

25:25.210 --> 25:27.050
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

25:28.090 --> 25:29.930
Nice talking to ya.

25:32.410 --> 25:34.450
What the fuck
do you want?

25:34.490 --> 25:37.210
I'm Gerald Lambeau.

25:37.290 --> 25:40.090
Professor you told
to fuck himself.

25:41.210 --> 25:44.170
Well, what the fuck
do you want?

25:44.250 --> 25:48.130
I've spoken to the judge, and he's agreed
to release you under my supervision.

25:48.210 --> 25:50.530
- Really?
- Yeah.

25:55.610 --> 25:58.130
- Under two conditions.
- What are those?

25:58.210 --> 26:00.730
First condition is that
you meet with me every week.

26:00.810 --> 26:04.010
- What for?
- Go over the proof you're working on,

26:04.090 --> 26:08.650
get into
some more advanced...

26:08.730 --> 26:11.570
combinatorial mathematics,

26:11.650 --> 26:13.530
finite math.

26:15.610 --> 26:17.450
Sounds like a real hoot.

26:18.810 --> 26:21.930
And the second condition
is that-

26:22.010 --> 26:24.210
that you see a therapist.

26:27.850 --> 26:31.090
I'm responsible to submit reports
on those meetings.

26:31.130 --> 26:35.970
If you fail to meet with any of those
conditions, you will have to serve time.

26:36.050 --> 26:40.290
All right. I'll do the math, but I'm not
gonna meet with any fuckin' therapist.

26:40.370 --> 26:44.130
It's better than spending
that time in jail, isn't it?

27:45.130 --> 27:49.210
I read your book, and "Mike"
was havin' the same problems...

27:49.290 --> 27:51.410
that "Chad," the stockbroker,
was havin'.

27:51.490 --> 27:54.370
Absolutely right. Right on the button.
Good for you, Will.

27:54.450 --> 27:56.330
- Very nice.
- Thank you.

27:56.370 --> 27:59.210
Will, the pressures-
and I'm not judging them.

27:59.290 --> 28:01.970
I'm not labeling them,

28:02.050 --> 28:04.850
but they are destroying
your potential.

28:04.930 --> 28:09.770
No more shenanigans.
No more tomfoolery. No more ballyhoo.

28:09.850 --> 28:14.530
You're right.
God, I know.

28:14.570 --> 28:18.250
You're not gonna get off that easily.
Come on, Will. A bit more.

28:18.290 --> 28:23.170
- Well, I mean, I do do things, you
know? - What- What kind of things?

28:23.210 --> 28:25.730
I do things that, you know,
I mean, I hide from people.

28:25.770 --> 28:30.970
- You hide, do you? - No, no. I
mean, I like- I go places. I interact.

28:31.050 --> 28:33.010
- Really? What sort of places?
- Just certain clubs.

28:33.090 --> 28:35.090
More. That's nice. Yes.
What sort of clubs?

28:35.170 --> 28:37.450
Like, uh, like Fantasy.

28:37.530 --> 28:40.930
Fantasy. That's nice.
A bit more.

28:40.970 --> 28:44.450
It's something like when you get
in there, the music, like, owns you.

28:44.530 --> 28:46.930
It's like that house music. It's like-
% Bom, bom, bom %

28:47.010 --> 28:49.650
% Bom-bom-bom
Boom, boom, boom, boom %%

28:49.730 --> 28:52.130
- You know, you start dancin'.
- Boom, boom, boom. Yeah.

28:52.210 --> 28:54.450
It's just-

28:54.530 --> 28:56.130
Yes.

28:59.650 --> 29:02.050
Do you find it hard to hide
the fact that you're gay?

29:02.130 --> 29:04.850
What are you talking about? What?

29:04.930 --> 29:07.570
Look, buddy, two seconds ago,
you were ready to give me a jump.

29:07.650 --> 29:11.010
A jump? Are you-

29:11.090 --> 29:12.970
I'm terribly sorry
to disappoint you.

29:13.050 --> 29:15.690
Hey, I don't have a problem with it.
I don't care if you putt from the rough.

29:15.770 --> 29:19.530
What are you- P- Putting from the rough?
What on earth are you talking about?

29:19.570 --> 29:24.610
A difficult theorem
could be like a symphony.

29:24.650 --> 29:27.130
It's very erotic.

29:27.210 --> 29:29.450
You go somewhere else.
I can't handle this.

29:29.530 --> 29:32.730
- Wow.
- Thank you, Henry.

29:32.810 --> 29:35.410
- Ah, Henry.
- Hi, Gerry.

29:35.490 --> 29:37.810
You know something?
I can't do this pro bono work anymore.

29:37.890 --> 29:40.290
- It's just not- It's not worth it.
- What happened?

29:40.370 --> 29:42.250
Well, I'm going on national
television next week.

29:42.290 --> 29:45.650
I mean, I haven't got time to tell you, much
less talk to that raving looney in there.

29:45.730 --> 29:48.530
An absolute lunatic,
he is.

29:48.610 --> 29:51.050
Henry.

29:51.130 --> 29:53.690
Okay,
you are in your bed, Will.

29:53.770 --> 29:57.250
Now, how old are you?

29:58.330 --> 30:00.170
Seven.

30:00.250 --> 30:02.090
What do you see?

30:03.850 --> 30:06.410
Something's in my room.

30:06.490 --> 30:08.970
What is it?

30:09.050 --> 30:13.850
It's like a- It's a figure.
It's hoverin' over me.

30:13.930 --> 30:17.330
You are in a safe place,
Will.

30:17.410 --> 30:20.770
It's t-
It's touchin' me.

30:20.850 --> 30:23.650
Where is it touching you?

30:23.690 --> 30:26.090
It's touching me
down there,

30:27.570 --> 30:29.570
and I'm nervous.

30:29.650 --> 30:33.250
You don't have to be
nervous, Will.

30:33.330 --> 30:37.010
We start dancin' and dancin'.

30:37.090 --> 30:38.930
It's just beautiful,

30:39.010 --> 30:40.850
'cause we can make...

30:40.930 --> 30:46.130
a lot of love
before the sun goes down.

30:46.210 --> 30:50.050
% Skyrockets
in flight %

30:50.130 --> 30:52.770
% Afternoon delight %

30:52.850 --> 30:56.170
- % Hey, hey, hey, afternoon delight %
- Jesus.

30:56.250 --> 31:00.090
% Skyrockets in flight
Da-da-da-da %

31:00.170 --> 31:03.490
- I'm sorry, Rich.
- I have better things to do with my time.

31:03.570 --> 31:06.970
% Hey, hey, afternoon delight %%
Come on! One dance!

31:07.050 --> 31:09.770
You really hypnotized me,
you know?

31:09.810 --> 31:13.490
- For God's sake, Will.
- What? Oh, come on. He left. You can't pin that on me.

31:13.570 --> 31:16.690
- I told you to cooperate with these people.
- Look...

31:16.770 --> 31:19.050
- into my eyes.
- Get out, Will.

31:19.090 --> 31:21.570
I don't need therapy.

31:21.650 --> 31:25.290
That's enough. Get out!

31:25.370 --> 31:29.370
- I called Mel Weintraub this
morning to see- - Oh, what's the use?

31:29.450 --> 31:31.290
What do you want to do?

31:33.250 --> 31:37.650
- Well, there's someone.
- Who is he?

31:37.730 --> 31:42.930
He used to be my, uh-
my roommate in college.

31:46.330 --> 31:50.090
Trust. Very important
in a relationship.

31:50.170 --> 31:52.090
It's also very important
in a clinical situation.

31:52.170 --> 31:54.890
Why is trust
the most important thing...

31:54.930 --> 31:59.170
in making a breakthrough
with a client?

31:59.210 --> 32:03.570
Maureen, stop the oral fixation
for a moment and join us.

32:03.650 --> 32:07.090
- Vinnie.
- Um-

32:07.170 --> 32:10.010
Because, uh-

32:10.090 --> 32:12.930
Trust is, uh-
Trust is life.

32:13.010 --> 32:16.530
Wow. That's very deep.
Thank you, Vinnie.

32:16.610 --> 32:19.210
Next time,
get the notes from your brother.

32:19.290 --> 32:22.530
If a patient doesn't feel safe enough trust
you, then they won't be honest with you.

32:22.570 --> 32:24.650
Then there's really no point
for them being in therapy.

32:24.730 --> 32:28.650
I mean, hey, if they don't trust you, you're
never gonna get them to sleep with you.

32:28.730 --> 32:31.610
That should be the goal of any good
therapist. Nail 'em while they're vulnerable.

32:31.690 --> 32:33.290
That's my motto.

32:33.370 --> 32:35.810
Oh, good, everyone's back.
Welcome back, everybody.

32:37.130 --> 32:40.770
- Hello, Sean.
- Hey, Gerry.

32:42.770 --> 32:47.690
Um, ladies and gentlemen,
we are in the presence of greatness.

32:47.770 --> 32:51.610
Professor Gerald Lambeau, Field's medal
winner for combinatorial mathematics.

32:51.690 --> 32:54.370
- Hello.
- Anyone know what the Field's medal is?

32:54.410 --> 32:57.090
It's a really big deal.
It's like the Nobel prize for math.

32:57.170 --> 33:02.010
Except they only give it out once
every four years. It's a great thing.

33:02.090 --> 33:05.050
It's an amazing honor.
Okay, everybody, that's it for today.

33:05.130 --> 33:08.410
Thanks. We'll see you Monday.
We'll be talking about Freud.

33:08.490 --> 33:11.650
Why he did enough cocaine
to kill a small horse. Thank you.

33:13.450 --> 33:16.010
- How are you?
- It's good to see you.

33:16.090 --> 33:17.930
Good to see you.

33:18.010 --> 33:21.450
- Sean, I think I got something interesting for ya.
- Yeah?

33:21.530 --> 33:23.930
What, you have to have
blood and urine? What's up?

33:24.010 --> 33:26.210
Why didn't you come
to the reunion?

33:26.290 --> 33:29.610
You know, I'm-
I've been busy.

33:29.690 --> 33:31.530
- You were missed.
- Really?

33:31.610 --> 33:35.770
- So how long has it been since we've seen each other?
- Before Nancy died.

33:35.850 --> 33:37.690
Yeah, I'm sorry.

33:37.770 --> 33:40.330
I was in Paris.
It was that damn conference.

33:40.410 --> 33:42.010
I got your card.
It was nice.

33:47.250 --> 33:49.090
- Come here.
- Now that's a takedown.

33:49.130 --> 33:52.850
Hey, what happened?
Did you get leniency or what?

33:52.930 --> 33:57.450
I got, uh, probation
and then counseling two days a week.

33:57.530 --> 34:01.090
Joke. You're a smoothie.
Come on, Morgan! Just submit!

34:03.330 --> 34:05.170
Hey, Bill, just-just get off him.
We're gonna miss the game.

34:05.250 --> 34:07.170
- I've got a full schedule. I'm very busy.
- Sean, Sean.

34:07.250 --> 34:10.130
This-This boy is incredible.
I've never seen anything like him.

34:10.210 --> 34:13.449
What makes him
so incredible, Gerry?

34:13.489 --> 34:17.409
- You ever heard of Ramanujan?
- Yeah, yeah. No.

34:17.489 --> 34:22.050
It's a man. He lived
over 100 years ago. He was Indian.

34:22.090 --> 34:24.850
- Dots, not feathers.
- Not feathers. Yeah.

34:24.929 --> 34:26.770
He lived in this tiny hut
somewhere in India.

34:26.850 --> 34:29.170
He had no formal education.

34:29.250 --> 34:31.650
- He had no access to any scientific work.
- Coffee?

34:31.730 --> 34:33.889
- You, sir?
- Just a little.

34:33.929 --> 34:36.250
But he came across
this old math book,

34:36.330 --> 34:38.850
and from the simple text,
he was able to extrapolate theories...

34:38.889 --> 34:40.770
that had baffled
mathematicians for years.

34:40.810 --> 34:43.810
Yes. Continued fractions.
He wrote, uh-

34:43.850 --> 34:47.810
- Well, he mailed it to Hardy at Cambridge.
- Yeah, Cambridge. Yeah.

34:47.850 --> 34:51.010
- And Hardy immediately recognized
the brilliance of his work... - Mm-hmm.

34:51.090 --> 34:54.530
and brought him over to England,
and then they worked together for years,

34:54.610 --> 34:57.010
creating some of the most
exciting math theory ever done.

34:57.090 --> 34:59.330
This-This Ramanujan-

34:59.370 --> 35:03.210
his-his genius
was unparalleled, Sean.

35:03.290 --> 35:06.570
- Well, this boy's just like that.
- Hmm.

35:06.610 --> 35:10.050
- But he's- he's a bit defensive.
- Hmm.

35:10.130 --> 35:12.010
I need someone
who can get through to him.

35:12.090 --> 35:15.490
- Like me?
- Yeah, like you.

35:15.530 --> 35:18.530
- Why?
- Well, because you have the same kind of background.

35:18.570 --> 35:21.730
- What background?
- Well, you're from the same neighborhood.

35:21.810 --> 35:24.970
- He's from Southie?
- Yeah.

35:25.050 --> 35:27.770
Boy genius from Southie.

35:27.850 --> 35:31.810
- How many shrinks you go to before me?
- Five.

35:31.890 --> 35:36.130
- Let me guess. Barry? Henry? Not Rick?
- Yeah. Yeah.

35:36.170 --> 35:39.170
- Sean, please, just meet
with him once a week. - Mm-hmm.

35:39.210 --> 35:41.090
Please?

35:44.050 --> 35:47.090
It's a poker game with this kid.
Don't let him know what you've got.

35:47.170 --> 35:50.130
He probably even read your book,
if he could find it.

35:50.210 --> 35:52.490
It's gonna be hard
for him to find.

35:52.570 --> 35:53.930
- Hi, Will.
- Hi.

35:54.010 --> 35:55.850
This is Sean Maguire.
Will Hunting.

35:55.930 --> 35:57.770
How are ya?

36:02.050 --> 36:03.930
- Yeah. Let's get started.
- Yeah, let's do it.

36:03.970 --> 36:05.970
I'm pumped.
Let's let the healing begin.

36:06.050 --> 36:09.410
- Will you excuse us?
- Yeah, please, Tom.

36:09.490 --> 36:11.970
You, too, Gerry.

36:12.050 --> 36:13.890
Yeah, of course.

36:19.090 --> 36:20.930
How are you?

36:22.890 --> 36:25.130
Where you from
in Southie?

36:25.210 --> 36:27.970
- I like what you've done with the place.
- Oh, thanks.

36:28.050 --> 36:30.210
Do you buy all these books
retail,

36:30.290 --> 36:34.210
or do you send away for, like, a "shrink kit"
that comes with all these volumes included?

36:34.290 --> 36:37.690
- Do you like books?
- Yeah.

36:37.770 --> 36:39.810
- Did you read any of these books?
- I don't know.

36:39.890 --> 36:42.530
- How about any of these books?
- Probably not.

36:42.610 --> 36:46.130
What about the ones
on the top shelf? You read those?

36:46.210 --> 36:50.010
- Yeah, I read those.
- Good for you. What do you think about 'em?

36:50.050 --> 36:52.810
I'm not here for a fuckin' book report.
They're your books. Why don't you read 'em?

36:52.890 --> 36:54.650
I did. I had to.

36:54.690 --> 36:58.010
- Must've taken you a long time.
- Yeah, it did.

37:04.410 --> 37:09.130
United States of America:
A Complete History, Volume I.

37:19.090 --> 37:22.490
Jesus. If you wanna read
a real history book,

37:22.570 --> 37:24.450
read Howard Zinn's
A People's History in the United States.

37:24.530 --> 37:26.370
That book'll fuckin'
knock you on your ass.

37:26.450 --> 37:28.370
Better than Chomsky's
Manufacturing Consent?

37:28.450 --> 37:33.050
- Do you think that's a good book?
- You fuckin' people baffle me.

37:33.090 --> 37:37.570
You spend all your money on these fuckin'
fancy books. You surround yourselves with 'em.

37:37.650 --> 37:39.930
- They're the wrong fuckin' books.
- What are the right fuckin' books, Will?

37:40.010 --> 37:44.170
- Whatever blows your hair back.
- Yeah. Haven't got much hair left.

37:44.250 --> 37:46.730
Hey, you know you'd be better
shoving that cigarette up your ass.

37:46.810 --> 37:48.850
- It'd probably be healthier for you.
- Yeah, I know.

37:48.890 --> 37:52.210
- It really gets in the way of my yoga.
- You work out, huh?

37:52.290 --> 37:55.090
- What, you lift?
- Yeah.

37:55.130 --> 37:57.570
- Nautilus?
- No, free weights.

37:57.650 --> 37:58.970
- Oh, really? Free weights, huh?
- Yeah. Yeah, big time.

37:59.050 --> 38:00.250
- Yeah?
- Just like that.

38:00.330 --> 38:04.890
- What do you bench?
- 285. What do you bench?

38:04.930 --> 38:07.050
You paint that?

38:07.130 --> 38:08.970
- Yeah. Do you paint?
- Uh-uh.

38:09.050 --> 38:12.370
- Do you sculpt?
- No.

38:12.450 --> 38:14.690
Do you like art?

38:14.770 --> 38:18.890
- Do you like music?
- This is a real piece of shit.

38:18.970 --> 38:20.810
Oh, tell me what
you really think.

38:20.890 --> 38:26.290
Just the linear and impressionistic mix
makes a very muddled composition.

38:26.370 --> 38:30.410
It's also a Winslow Homer rip-off, except
you got whitey rowin' the boat there.

38:30.490 --> 38:32.330
Well, it's art, Monet.
It wasn't very good.

38:32.410 --> 38:34.770
- That's not really what concerns me though.
- What concerns you?

38:34.850 --> 38:37.170
- Just the coloring.
- You know what the real bitch of it is?

38:37.210 --> 38:39.250
It's paint-by-number.

38:39.330 --> 38:41.690
Is it color-by-number? Because
the colors are fascinating to me.

38:41.730 --> 38:43.170
- Aren't they really?
- You bet.

38:43.250 --> 38:46.770
I think you're about one step away
from cuttin' your fuckin' ear off.

38:46.850 --> 38:48.370
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

38:48.410 --> 38:51.930
Think I should move to the south of
France, change my name to "Vincent"?

38:52.010 --> 38:55.210
- You ever heard the sayin', "any port in a storm"?
- Yeah.

38:55.290 --> 38:58.130
- Yeah, maybe that means you.
- In what way?

38:58.170 --> 39:01.490
- Maybe you're in the middle of a storm, a big fuckin' storm.
- Yeah, maybe.

39:01.570 --> 39:04.610
The sky's fallin' on your head. The
waves are crashin' over your little boat.

39:04.690 --> 39:06.690
The oars are about to snap.

39:06.770 --> 39:08.650
You just piss in your pants.
You're cryin' for the harbor.

39:08.730 --> 39:10.890
So maybe you do
what you gotta do to get out.

39:10.970 --> 39:13.210
You know, maybe you became
a psychologist.

39:13.250 --> 39:16.650
Bingo. That's it. Let me do my job now.
You start with me. Come on.

39:18.970 --> 39:24.130
- Maybe you married the wrong woman.
- Maybe you should watch your mouth!

39:24.210 --> 39:27.010
Watch it right there, chief,
all right?

39:28.770 --> 39:30.650
Ah.

39:34.330 --> 39:36.770
That's it, isn't it?

39:36.850 --> 39:40.210
You married
the wrong woman.

39:40.250 --> 39:44.730
What happened?
What, did she leave you?

39:44.810 --> 39:47.690
Was she, you know-
banging some other guy?

39:49.650 --> 39:52.290
If you ever disrespect my wife again,
I will end you.

39:52.370 --> 39:54.370
I will fuckin' end you.

39:54.450 --> 39:57.770
Got that, chief?

39:57.850 --> 39:59.690
Time's up.

39:59.770 --> 40:02.010
Yeah.

40:14.730 --> 40:16.570
At ease, gentlemen.

40:22.450 --> 40:24.290
You okay?

40:29.490 --> 40:33.330
Look, I'll understand if you don't
wanna meet with him again.

40:33.370 --> 40:36.970
Thursday, 4:00.
Make sure the kid's here.

40:38.690 --> 40:41.010
Yeah.

40:41.050 --> 40:42.930
Thanks.

41:44.290 --> 41:47.490
Well, you look lovely
in those glasses.

41:47.570 --> 41:49.410
- Thank you very much.
- They're just beautiful.

41:49.490 --> 41:53.250
- Yes, I always wanted dark blue eye shadow.
- Wonderful.

41:55.770 --> 41:59.050
Growing up in England, you know,
I went to a very nice school.

41:59.130 --> 42:04.210
You know, it was kind of progressive,
organic, do-it-yourself, private school.

42:04.250 --> 42:08.530
Then Harvard.
Hopefully med school.

42:08.610 --> 42:10.490
You know, I figured out,
by the end,

42:10.530 --> 42:14.650
my brain's gonna be worth
$250,000.

42:14.730 --> 42:18.130
That sounded horrible,
didn't it?

42:18.170 --> 42:20.730
Bring me another mai tai!

42:20.810 --> 42:24.850
Yeah, that's cool. I mean,
I bet your parents were happy to pay.

42:24.890 --> 42:28.650
No, I was happy to pay.
I inherited the money.

42:28.730 --> 42:32.010
Wow. Is Harvard gettin'
all that money?

42:32.090 --> 42:34.970
No, Stanford. I'm going there
in June when I graduate.

42:35.050 --> 42:39.890
All right, so you just wanted to use
this sailor and then run away, huh?

42:39.930 --> 42:43.050
I was gonna, you know, experiment on you
for anatomy class first, obviously.

42:43.130 --> 42:45.330
In that case, that's fine.

42:45.370 --> 42:48.050
- Hey, you wanna see my magic tricks, Skylar?
- Of course.

42:48.090 --> 42:51.170
All right.
Promise to-

42:51.250 --> 42:53.450
All right.

42:53.530 --> 42:57.050
- This one's for you, Rudolph.
- Wait, wait. You need my wand.

42:57.130 --> 42:59.850
All right, give me a hit.
Thank you. All right.

42:59.930 --> 43:01.770
I'm gonna make
all these caramels disappear.

43:01.850 --> 43:04.530
You ready?
Ready.

43:04.570 --> 43:07.090
One, two, three.

43:07.130 --> 43:10.010
They're all gone.

43:10.090 --> 43:12.530
That was my- It works better
when I have my rabbit.

43:12.690 --> 43:15.450
Well-

43:15.530 --> 43:18.050
I don't really date,
you know, that much.

43:18.130 --> 43:22.850
How very unfortunate...
I think for me.

43:22.930 --> 43:26.090
You know what I mean?
I know you've been thinking about it.

43:26.130 --> 43:28.010
- Oh, no, I haven't.
- Yes, you have.

43:28.050 --> 43:30.650
- No, I really haven't.
- Yes, you have. You were hoping to get a good night kiss.

43:30.730 --> 43:33.690
No, you know, I tell ya,
I was hopin' to get a good night laid.

43:36.090 --> 43:38.490
But I'll settle for,
like, a kiss, you know?

43:38.570 --> 43:41.250
- How very noble of you.
- Thank you.

43:41.330 --> 43:44.650
- Mm.
- No, I was- I was hopin' for a kiss.

43:45.970 --> 43:49.970
Well, why don't we just
get it out of the way now?

43:50.050 --> 43:52.370
- Right now?
- Yeah.

43:52.450 --> 43:54.290
Come on.

44:02.210 --> 44:05.130
I think I got
some of your pickle.

44:15.250 --> 44:17.610
You again, huh?

44:19.410 --> 44:21.610
Come with me.

44:27.250 --> 44:32.450
So what's this?
A Taster's Choice moment between guys?

44:32.530 --> 44:36.930
This is really nice. You got a thing
for swans? Is this, like, a fetish?

44:37.010 --> 44:39.210
Is it something, like, maybe
we need to devote some time to?

44:41.050 --> 44:46.170
- Thought about what you said to me the other day. About my painting.
- Oh.

44:46.250 --> 44:49.050
Stayed up half the night
thinking about it.

44:50.210 --> 44:52.290
Something occurred to me.

44:52.370 --> 44:56.730
I fell into a deep, peaceful sleep
and haven't thought about you since.

44:56.810 --> 44:59.650
- You know what occurred to me?
- No.

44:59.730 --> 45:04.050
You're just a kid. You don't have the
faintest idea what you're talking about.

45:04.130 --> 45:07.090
- Why, thank you.
- It's all right.

45:07.170 --> 45:09.490
You've never been
out of Boston.

45:11.570 --> 45:13.450
Nope.

45:13.490 --> 45:15.570
So if I asked you about art,
you'd probably give me the skinny...

45:15.650 --> 45:18.130
on every art book
ever written.

45:18.210 --> 45:21.810
Michelangelo?
You know a lot about him.

45:21.890 --> 45:25.410
Life's work, political aspirations.
Him and the pope.

45:25.490 --> 45:30.090
Sexual orientation.
The whole works, right?

45:30.130 --> 45:34.410
I bet you can't tell me what it
smells like in the Sistine Chapel.

45:36.050 --> 45:40.330
You never actually stood there
and looked up at that beautiful ceiling.

45:42.890 --> 45:45.290
Seeing that.

45:45.370 --> 45:47.210
If I ask you about women,

45:47.290 --> 45:50.810
you'll probably give me a syllabus
of your personal favorites.

45:50.890 --> 45:53.690
You may have even been laid
a few times.

45:58.570 --> 46:01.690
But you can't tell me what it feels like
to wake up next to a woman...

46:01.770 --> 46:04.090
and feel truly happy.

46:07.090 --> 46:08.930
You're a tough kid.

46:10.690 --> 46:14.370
I ask you about war, you'd probably
throw Shakespeare at me, right?

46:14.450 --> 46:17.730
"Once more into the breach,
dear friends. "

46:18.930 --> 46:21.890
But you've never been near one.

46:21.970 --> 46:24.610
You've never held your best friend's
head in your lap...

46:24.690 --> 46:28.930
and watch him gasp his last
breath lookin' to you for help.

46:30.770 --> 46:35.730
If I asked you about love,
you'd probably quote me a sonnet,

46:35.810 --> 46:39.810
but you've never looked at a woman
and been totally vulnerable.

46:39.890 --> 46:44.010
Known someone that could
level you with her eyes.

46:44.050 --> 46:48.330
Feelin' like God put
an angel on Earth just for you,

46:48.410 --> 46:51.250
who could rescue you
from the depths of hell.

46:51.330 --> 46:54.410
And you wouldn't know
what it's like to be her angel,

46:54.450 --> 46:57.410
to have that love for her
be there forever.

46:57.490 --> 47:01.770
Through anything.
Through cancer.

47:01.850 --> 47:04.010
And you wouldn't know about sleepin'
sittin' up in a hospital room...

47:04.090 --> 47:06.090
for two months,
holding her hand,

47:06.170 --> 47:08.010
because the doctors
could see in your eyes...

47:08.090 --> 47:12.490
that the terms "visiting hours"
don't apply to you.

47:12.570 --> 47:14.650
You don't know about real loss,

47:14.730 --> 47:19.530
'cause that only occurs when you love
something more than you love yourself.

47:19.610 --> 47:23.370
I doubt you've ever dared
to love anybody that much.

47:25.650 --> 47:30.410
I look at you. I don't see
an intelligent, confident man.

47:32.650 --> 47:35.930
I see a cocky,
scared shitless kid.

47:37.610 --> 47:40.810
But you're a genius, Will.
No one denies that.

47:40.890 --> 47:44.290
No one could possibly understand
the depths of you.

47:44.370 --> 47:47.330
But you presume to know everything about
me because you saw a painting of mine.

47:47.410 --> 47:50.210
You ripped
my fuckin' life apart.

47:53.570 --> 47:55.890
You're an orphan, right?

47:59.570 --> 48:03.450
Do you think I'd know the first thing
about how hard your life has been-

48:03.530 --> 48:06.010
how you feel, who you are-

48:06.090 --> 48:09.330
because I read Oliver Twist?

48:09.410 --> 48:11.570
Does that encapsulate you?

48:13.810 --> 48:16.690
Personally, I don't give a shit
about all that, because-

48:16.730 --> 48:18.810
You know what? I can't
learn anything from you...

48:18.890 --> 48:21.210
I can't read
in some fuckin' book.

48:22.970 --> 48:24.970
Unless you wanna talk
about you,

48:25.050 --> 48:26.890
who you are.

48:28.330 --> 48:32.050
And I'm fascinated.
I'm in.

48:34.130 --> 48:36.930
But you don't wanna do that,
do you, sport?

48:39.170 --> 48:41.970
You're terrified
of what you might say.

48:46.810 --> 48:48.650
Your move, chief.

49:53.490 --> 49:55.730
Hello? Hello?

49:55.810 --> 49:58.570
Hello?

49:58.610 --> 50:01.410
Professor Valenti,
are you calling me again?

50:04.210 --> 50:06.050
Freak.

50:09.770 --> 50:12.250
- Oh, God.
- Christ, who did you call?

50:12.330 --> 50:14.730
- No one. I forgot the number.
- You fuckin' retarded?

50:14.810 --> 50:17.250
You went all the way out there in the
rain, and you didn't bring the number.

50:17.290 --> 50:21.090
No, it was your mother's 900 number.
I just ran out of quarters.

50:21.130 --> 50:23.610
Why don't we get off on mothers?
I just got off yours.

50:23.690 --> 50:25.730
- That's
pretty funny, Morgan.

50:25.810 --> 50:28.170
That's a fuckin' nickel,
bitch.

50:28.210 --> 50:30.450
- Keep antagonizing me. Watch what happens.
- All right, then, Morgan.

50:30.530 --> 50:32.290
- Watch what happens.
- All right, then, Morgan.

50:32.370 --> 50:34.410
Keep fuckin' with me.

50:40.130 --> 50:41.970
No smoking.

51:12.610 --> 51:15.170
What do you mean, he didn't talk?
You were in there for an hour.

51:15.210 --> 51:18.370
He just sat there counting the seconds
until the session was over.

51:18.410 --> 51:21.010
- Pretty impressive, actually.
- Why would he do that?

51:21.090 --> 51:24.930
To prove to me he doesn't have
to talk to me if he doesn't want to.

51:25.010 --> 51:28.810
What is this? Some kind of staring contest
between two kids from the old neighborhood?

51:28.850 --> 51:32.490
Yeah, it is,
and I can't talk first.

51:32.570 --> 51:37.330
We know your theory, Alexander, but the
boy's found a simple geometrical picture.

51:37.410 --> 51:40.290
- A tree structure won't work.
- Look now. He's joining the two vertices.

51:40.370 --> 51:42.770
But I can do the sum.

51:42.850 --> 51:45.210
- It's how you group the terms, Alexander.
- But, Gerry.

51:45.290 --> 51:47.130
If we do the whole thing
this way, then-

51:47.210 --> 51:49.850
Hey, look, look.

51:49.930 --> 51:53.210
I wrote it down.
It's simpler this way.

52:03.370 --> 52:06.130
Sometimes
people get lucky.

52:06.210 --> 52:08.090
You're a brilliant man.

52:43.850 --> 52:46.330
You know,
I was on this plane once,

52:46.410 --> 52:49.130
and I'm sittin' there, and...

52:49.210 --> 52:51.050
the captain gets on,
he does his whole, you know,

52:51.130 --> 52:53.610
"we'll be cruisin' at 35,000 feet,"
but then he puts the mike down.

52:53.690 --> 52:56.250
- He forgets to turn it off.
- Mm-hmm.

52:56.330 --> 52:58.170
So he turns to the copilot.
He's, like,

52:58.250 --> 53:02.770
"You know, all I could use right now is
a fuckin' blow job and a cup of coffee. "

53:02.850 --> 53:05.290
So the stewardess fuckin' goes bombin'
up from the back of the plane...

53:05.370 --> 53:06.970
to tell him
the microphone's still on.

53:07.050 --> 53:10.250
This guy in the back of the plane's like,
"Hey, hon, don't forget the coffee. "

53:10.290 --> 53:13.650
You ever been on a plane?

53:13.730 --> 53:16.610
No, but it's a fuckin' joke. It works
better if I tell it in the first person.

53:16.650 --> 53:18.530
Yeah, it does.

53:21.530 --> 53:23.370
I have been laid,
you know?

53:23.450 --> 53:25.610
Really? Good for you.

53:25.690 --> 53:27.530
- Big time, big time.
- Big time, huh?

53:27.610 --> 53:30.610
I went on a date last week.

53:30.690 --> 53:33.570
- How'd it go?
- It was good.

53:33.650 --> 53:35.530
- Goin' out again?
- I don't know.

53:35.570 --> 53:37.170
- Why?
- Haven't called her.

53:37.250 --> 53:40.450
- Christ, you're an amateur.
- I know what I'm doin'.

53:40.490 --> 53:44.610
Yeah. Don't worry about me.
I know what I'm doin'.

53:44.650 --> 53:47.050
Yeah, but this girl was, like,
you know, beautiful.

53:47.090 --> 53:51.330
She's smart. She's fun. She's different
from most of the girls I've been with.

53:51.370 --> 53:55.050
- So call her up, Romeo.
- Why, so I can realize she's not that smart.

53:55.130 --> 53:57.370
That she's fuckin' boring?
You know, I mean, you don't-

53:57.450 --> 54:00.770
This girl's, like, fuckin' perfect
right now. I don't wanna ruin that.

54:00.810 --> 54:04.610
Maybe you're perfect right now.
Maybe you don't wanna ruin that.

54:06.210 --> 54:08.450
But I think that's
a super philosophy, Will.

54:08.490 --> 54:14.130
That way, you can go through your entire life
without ever having to really know anybody.

54:16.330 --> 54:18.210
My wife used to fart
when she was nervous.

54:18.250 --> 54:21.170
She had all sorts
of wonderful idiosyncrasies.

54:21.250 --> 54:23.730
You know, she used to fart
in her sleep.

54:23.810 --> 54:26.570
Just thought I'd share that
with you.

54:26.610 --> 54:29.090
One night it was so loud,
it woke the dog up.

54:32.770 --> 54:34.610
She woke up and gone, like,
"Was that you?"

54:34.690 --> 54:37.730
I said, "Yeah. " I didn't have
the heart to tell her. Oh, God.

54:37.810 --> 54:39.970
- She woke herself up?
- Yes.

54:44.810 --> 54:49.890
Oh, Christ. But, Will, she's been dead
two years and that's the shit I remember.

54:49.930 --> 54:52.970
It's wonderful stuff, you know?
Little things like that.

54:53.050 --> 54:56.850
Yeah, but those are the things
I miss the most.

54:56.930 --> 54:59.730
Those little idiosyncrasies
that only I knew about.

54:59.810 --> 55:02.290
That's what made her
my wife.

55:02.370 --> 55:05.610
Boy, and she had the goods on me too.
She knew all my little peccadillos.

55:05.650 --> 55:09.930
People call these things
"imperfections," but they're not.

55:10.010 --> 55:12.650
That's the good stuff.

55:12.690 --> 55:17.170
And then we get to choose who
we let into our weird little worlds.

55:17.250 --> 55:19.090
You're not perfect, sport.

55:19.170 --> 55:21.730
And let me save you
the suspense.

55:21.810 --> 55:24.970
This girl you met,
she isn't perfect either.

55:25.010 --> 55:28.690
But the question is whether or not
you're perfect for each other.

55:28.770 --> 55:32.930
That's the whole deal.
That's what intimacy is all about.

55:32.970 --> 55:34.850
Now you can know
everything in the world, sport,

55:34.890 --> 55:37.890
but the only way you're findin' out
that one is by givin' it a shot.

55:37.930 --> 55:40.530
You certainly won't learn
from an old fucker like me.

55:40.610 --> 55:44.130
Even if I did know,
I wouldn't tell a pissant like you.

55:44.210 --> 55:46.090
Yeah, why not?

55:46.170 --> 55:49.730
You told me every other
fuckin' thing. Jesus Christ.

55:49.810 --> 55:52.490
Fuckin' talk more than any shrink
I ever seen in my life.

55:52.530 --> 55:56.450
I teach the shit.
I didn't say I knew how to do it.

55:56.490 --> 55:58.370
Yeah.

56:01.330 --> 56:03.890
You ever think
about gettin' remarried?

56:03.970 --> 56:06.410
My wife's dead.

56:06.490 --> 56:09.490
- Hence the word "remarried. "
- She's dead.

56:12.010 --> 56:15.130
Yeah, well, I think
that's a super philosophy, Sean.

56:15.210 --> 56:17.290
I mean, that way, you can actually
go through the rest of your life...

56:17.370 --> 56:19.890
without ever really knowing
anybody.

56:22.250 --> 56:24.330
Time's up.

56:38.210 --> 56:40.330
- Hold it open.
- Okay.

56:40.410 --> 56:43.570
Thanks.

56:53.410 --> 56:57.050
% I am happy with you %

56:57.090 --> 57:00.930
% I know I'm about
to love you %

57:01.010 --> 57:06.010
% Yeah, yeah, yeah
You know him %

57:06.090 --> 57:09.370
% Oh, my, you made me- %%

57:09.410 --> 57:12.570
"G" minor seventh.
Saddest of all chords.

57:13.850 --> 57:15.690
- Hello.
- Hey.

57:15.770 --> 57:19.890
- Where have you been? - I'm sorry. I've
been, like- I've been really busy, and-

57:19.970 --> 57:22.450
- But, um-
- Mmm. Me too.

57:22.530 --> 57:27.490
Yeah. I-
I thought you'd call.

57:27.570 --> 57:29.610
Yeah, um-

57:29.690 --> 57:32.890
- I mean, we had a really good time.
- I had a really good time too.

57:32.970 --> 57:35.050
I mean, I just- I-

57:35.130 --> 57:37.170
I'm sorry, you know.
I blew it.

57:37.250 --> 57:39.290
No. No, I mean,
you know, it's all right.

57:39.370 --> 57:42.410
Yeah, um, so, I was
wonderin' if, uh,

57:42.490 --> 57:44.330
if, you know, you'd give me
another crack at it.

57:44.410 --> 57:46.890
You know, let me
take you out again.

57:46.970 --> 57:49.530
- I can't.
- All right.

57:49.570 --> 57:52.850
Oh, no, I didn't- I didn't mean
I can't, like, ever.

57:52.930 --> 57:54.770
I just can't right now.

57:54.850 --> 57:57.730
I've got to assign
the proton spectrum for "ebogamine. "

57:57.810 --> 58:01.650
All that sounds really, really interesting.
It's actually fantastically boring.

58:01.730 --> 58:04.490
- All right, um-
- Maybe some other time.

58:04.570 --> 58:08.410
- Like tomorrow?
- Um, yeah, all right.

58:08.490 --> 58:10.850
- Okay.
- Okay.

58:10.890 --> 58:13.170
- Bye.
- Bye.

58:24.410 --> 58:26.810
What are you doing here?

58:26.890 --> 58:29.050
I couldn't wait
till tomorrow.

58:29.130 --> 58:31.970
Where the fuck
did you get this?

58:32.050 --> 58:34.050
I had to sleep
with someone in your class.

58:34.130 --> 58:39.530
Oh, I hope it was someone with the
open-toed sandals and the really bad breath.

58:39.610 --> 58:43.410
- Come on. Let's go have some fun.
- No, I've got to learn this.

58:43.490 --> 58:46.010
Well, you're not going into
surgery tomorrow, are you?

58:46.090 --> 58:47.970
- No.
- Let's go.

58:51.930 --> 58:55.250
Oh, my God!
My dog is winning!

58:55.330 --> 58:57.530
Come on, Misty!

58:57.610 --> 59:00.210
Come on! Run!
Look at that! Come on!

59:00.290 --> 59:02.130
Look, there he goes.
Misty, run! Come on!

59:04.370 --> 59:08.410
- We won.
- He totally won.

59:10.250 --> 59:12.410
So did you grow up
around here then?

59:12.490 --> 59:14.610
Not far.
South Boston.

59:17.090 --> 59:18.970
Still glowing from my win.

59:19.010 --> 59:22.490
Look at you.
You're so happy.

59:22.570 --> 59:24.530
And what was
that like then?

59:24.610 --> 59:28.090
It was normal, I guess.
Nothin' special.

59:28.170 --> 59:31.250
Do you got lots of
brothers and sisters?

59:31.330 --> 59:34.410
- Do I have a lot of brothers and sisters?
- That's what I said.

59:34.490 --> 59:39.810
- Well, Irish Catholic, what do you think?
- Right. That's right.

59:39.890 --> 59:44.650
- How many?
- You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

59:44.730 --> 59:48.090
- Why? Go on. What? Five?
- No.

59:48.170 --> 59:51.290
Seven? Eight?
How many?

59:51.370 --> 59:53.490
- I have 12 big brothers.
- You do not!

59:53.570 --> 59:56.250
No, I swear to God. I swear to God.
I'm lucky 13 right here.

59:56.330 --> 59:58.210
Do you know
all their names?

59:58.250 --> 01:00:00.730
Do I- Yeah,
they're my brothers.

01:00:00.810 --> 01:00:02.810
What are they called?

01:00:02.890 --> 01:00:07.050
Marky, Ricky, Danny, Terry, Mikey, Davey,
Timmy, Tommy, Joey, Robby, Johnny and Brian.

01:00:07.130 --> 01:00:09.490
Say it again.

01:00:09.570 --> 01:00:13.490
Marky, Ricky, Danny, Terry, Mikey, Davey,
Timmy, Tommy, Joey, Robby, Johnny and Brian.

01:00:13.570 --> 01:00:16.050
And Willy.

01:00:16.130 --> 01:00:17.370
- Willy?
- Yeah.

01:00:17.450 --> 01:00:18.890
- Will.
- Wow.

01:00:18.970 --> 01:00:22.610
- Do you still see all of them?
- Yeah, well, they all live in Southie.

01:00:22.690 --> 01:00:25.170
- I'm livin' with three of 'em right now.
- Oh, yeah?

01:00:25.250 --> 01:00:26.650
- Yeah.
- I'd like to meet them.

01:00:26.730 --> 01:00:29.010
Yeah, we'll do that.

01:00:29.210 --> 01:00:31.490
Oh, you know,
I read your book last night.

01:00:31.570 --> 01:00:34.010
Oh, so you're the one.

01:00:34.090 --> 01:00:35.970
Do you still, uh-
Do you still counsel veterans?

01:00:36.050 --> 01:00:37.290
No, I don't.

01:00:37.370 --> 01:00:41.850
- Why not?
- Well, I gave it up when my wife got sick.

01:00:41.890 --> 01:00:47.210
You ever wonder what your life would be
like if you, uh, if you never met your wife?

01:00:47.290 --> 01:00:49.130
What? Wonder if I'd be
better off without her?

01:00:49.210 --> 01:00:51.250
- No, no, no, I'm not saying, like, better off.
- No.

01:00:51.330 --> 01:00:55.130
- I didn't mean it like that.
- It's all right. It's an important question.

01:00:55.210 --> 01:00:57.370
'Cause you'll have bad times,
but that'll always wake you up...

01:00:57.450 --> 01:00:59.610
to the good stuff
you weren't paying attention to.

01:00:59.690 --> 01:01:02.170
And you don't regret
meetin' your wife?

01:01:02.250 --> 01:01:04.850
Why? 'Cause the pain
I feel now?

01:01:04.930 --> 01:01:10.050
Oh, I got regrets, Will, but I don't
regret a single day I spent with her.

01:01:13.730 --> 01:01:16.970
So when did you know, like,
that she was the one for you?

01:01:17.050 --> 01:01:19.650
October 21, 1975.

01:01:19.730 --> 01:01:21.730
Jesus Christ.
You know the fuckin' day?

01:01:21.810 --> 01:01:26.610
Oh, yeah, 'cause it was game six of the
World Series, biggest game in Red Sox history.

01:01:26.690 --> 01:01:31.570
- Yeah, sure.
- My friends and I had slept out all night to get tickets.

01:01:31.650 --> 01:01:34.970
- You got tickets?
- Yep. Day of the game I was sittin' in a bar,

01:01:35.050 --> 01:01:38.410
waitin' for the game to start
and in walks this girl.

01:01:38.490 --> 01:01:41.690
It was an amazing game though. You know,
bottom of the eighth, Carbo ties it up.

01:01:41.770 --> 01:01:43.810
It was 6-6.
It went to 12.

01:01:43.890 --> 01:01:47.570
Bottom of the 12th, in stepped
Carlton Fisk, old Pudge.

01:01:47.650 --> 01:01:49.610
Steps up to the plate.
You know, he's got that weird stance.

01:01:49.690 --> 01:01:53.130
- Yeah, yeah. - And then-
Boom! He clocks it, you know.

01:01:53.210 --> 01:01:55.770
High fly ball
down the left field line!

01:01:55.810 --> 01:01:58.290
Thirty-five thousand people
on their feet, yellin' at the ball.

01:01:58.370 --> 01:02:00.770
But that's nothin', 'cause Fisk,
he's wavin' at the ball like a madman.

01:02:00.850 --> 01:02:02.690
- Yeah, I've seen that.
- "Get over! Get over!

01:02:02.770 --> 01:02:04.130
- Right.
- Get over!"

01:02:04.210 --> 01:02:08.450
Then it hits the foul pole.
He goes ape-shit, and 35,000 fans-

01:02:08.490 --> 01:02:10.490
They charge the field,
you know.

01:02:10.570 --> 01:02:12.810
Yeah, and he's fuckin'
blowin' people outta the way.

01:02:12.890 --> 01:02:14.930
"Get outta the way!
Get outta the way!"

01:02:15.010 --> 01:02:18.010
I can't fuckin' believe you had
tickets to that fuckin' game!

01:02:18.090 --> 01:02:21.050
- Did you rush the field?
- No, I didn't rush the fuckin' field. I wasn't there.

01:02:21.130 --> 01:02:24.010
- What?
- No, I was in a bar, havin' a drink with my future wife.

01:02:24.090 --> 01:02:28.490
You missed Pudge Fisk's home run to have a
fuckin' drink with some lady you never met?

01:02:28.570 --> 01:02:30.650
Yeah, but you should have
seen her. She was a stunner.

01:02:30.730 --> 01:02:33.170
- I don't care if-
- Oh, no, no, she lit up the room.

01:02:33.250 --> 01:02:36.090
- I don't care if Helen of Troy walks into the room.
- Oh, Helen of Troy!

01:02:36.170 --> 01:02:38.210
That's game six! Oh, my God,
and who were these friends of yours?

01:02:38.290 --> 01:02:40.490
- They let you get away with that?
- They had to.

01:02:40.570 --> 01:02:44.010
- What did you say to 'em?
- I just slid my ticket across the table.

01:02:44.090 --> 01:02:47.050
I said, "Sorry, guys.
I gotta see about a girl. "

01:02:47.130 --> 01:02:49.210
- "I gotta go see about a girl"?
- Yes!

01:02:49.250 --> 01:02:51.170
That's what you said?
They let you get away with that?

01:02:51.250 --> 01:02:53.290
Oh, yeah. They saw it
in my eyes that I meant it.

01:02:53.370 --> 01:02:57.010
- You're kiddin' me?
- No, I'm not kidding you, Will.

01:02:57.090 --> 01:02:59.610
That's why I'm not talkin' right now about
some girl I saw at a bar 20 years ago...

01:02:59.690 --> 01:03:02.050
and how I always regretted
not goin' over and talkin' to her.

01:03:02.090 --> 01:03:05.130
I don't regret the 18 years
I was married to Nancy.

01:03:05.210 --> 01:03:08.130
I don't regret the six years I had
to give up counseling when she got sick,

01:03:08.210 --> 01:03:11.770
and I don't regret the last years
when she got really sick.

01:03:11.850 --> 01:03:14.370
And I sure as hell don't
regret missin' a damn game.

01:03:14.450 --> 01:03:17.050
That's regret.

01:03:17.130 --> 01:03:19.290
Wow!

01:03:24.130 --> 01:03:26.650
Would have been nice
to catch that game though.

01:03:26.730 --> 01:03:29.170
I didn't know Pudge
was gonna hit a home run.

01:03:31.170 --> 01:03:35.090
You know, I'm very, very
useful on the court.

01:03:35.170 --> 01:03:38.130
I'm extremely tall.

01:03:38.210 --> 01:03:40.930
- You're not that tall.
- I dunk.

01:03:42.410 --> 01:03:46.810
Will I ever play in the N.B.A.?

01:03:46.850 --> 01:03:50.290
"It is decidedly so. "
Hmph.

01:03:52.610 --> 01:03:55.170
Why do we always stay here?

01:03:55.250 --> 01:03:57.770
'Cause it's nicer
than my place.

01:03:57.850 --> 01:04:00.210
Yes, but I've never
seen your place.

01:04:00.290 --> 01:04:02.450
I know.

01:04:02.530 --> 01:04:04.890
When am I gonna meet
your friends and your brothers?

01:04:04.930 --> 01:04:08.250
Well, they don't really
come down here that much.

01:04:08.330 --> 01:04:10.370
I think I can make it
to South Boston.

01:04:10.450 --> 01:04:14.930
It's kind of a hike.

01:04:15.050 --> 01:04:17.850
Is it me you're hiding from them
or the other way around?

01:04:17.930 --> 01:04:20.370
- All right, we'll go.
- When?

01:04:20.410 --> 01:04:22.770
I don't know.
We'll go sometime next week.

01:04:22.810 --> 01:04:28.050
What if I said I would not sleep with you
again until you let me meet your friends?

01:04:33.490 --> 01:04:37.010
I'd say it's, like, 4:30 in the mornin'.
They're probably up.

01:04:37.050 --> 01:04:40.210
Oh, my God.
Men are shameless.

01:04:40.250 --> 01:04:44.410
If you're not thinking with your wiener,
then you're acting directly on its behalf.

01:04:44.490 --> 01:04:47.890
You bet. And on behalf of my wiener,
can I get an advance payment?

01:04:47.970 --> 01:04:52.490
I don't know. Let's ask.
"Outlook does not look good. "

01:04:52.570 --> 01:04:55.810
- What? - Fuck the- Hey, Chuck.
No. Nothing. Go back to sleep.

01:04:55.890 --> 01:04:58.970
"Outlook"? That's the same thing that
told you you was gonna play in the N.B.A.

01:04:59.050 --> 01:05:02.930
Exactly, so look out. You'd better
start buying some season tickets.

01:05:03.010 --> 01:05:07.610
Mmm! I plan to. I'm tall.
I like wearing shorts.

01:05:07.690 --> 01:05:09.810
Hook, hook. Dunk, dunk.

01:05:09.890 --> 01:05:12.570
- You're not that tall.
- Yes, I am.

01:05:12.650 --> 01:05:15.570
Maybe I'm all
about three points.

01:05:15.610 --> 01:05:17.810
I'm all about home runs.

01:05:17.850 --> 01:05:21.930
Stop mixing your
sporting metaphors.

01:05:33.010 --> 01:05:36.410
A leprechaun's got his dick
in the monkey's ass.

01:05:36.490 --> 01:05:40.050
Morgan comes runnin' in, goin',
"I don't mind it. I don't mind-"

01:05:42.050 --> 01:05:45.610
Well, I can't believe you brought Skylar here
when we're fuckin' all bombed and drinkin'.

01:05:45.690 --> 01:05:48.850
I know, Morgan. It's a real rarity
we'd be all drinkin'.

01:05:48.890 --> 01:05:51.650
My uncle Marty drinks. He'll go
on a bender for six, eight months.

01:05:51.730 --> 01:05:54.450
Did I ever tell ya what happened to him when
he was drivin' up there and got pulled over?

01:05:54.490 --> 01:05:56.690
- I told you guys, right?
- Marty, yeah.

01:05:56.770 --> 01:06:00.210
Let me tell ya what happened to my uncle
Marty, because you oughta know this.

01:06:00.290 --> 01:06:03.530
He's always tellin' stories. Every time
we come here he's got another story.

01:06:03.610 --> 01:06:07.410
But we all heard this one.
Go ahead. Say it anyway.

01:06:07.490 --> 01:06:12.410
I will go ahead. Thanks a lot.
Guess I have the floor now.

01:06:12.490 --> 01:06:15.050
My uncle Marty's
drivin' home, right?

01:06:15.130 --> 01:06:19.690
Bombed out of his tree, right? Just
hammered out of his gourd. Just wrecked.

01:06:19.770 --> 01:06:23.730
This state trooper sees him, pulls him
over. So my uncle's fucked basically.

01:06:23.770 --> 01:06:25.930
Got him out of the car,
tryin' to make him walk the line.

01:06:26.010 --> 01:06:29.690
He gets out of the car, pukes, and the
statie's pretty sure he's over the legal limit.

01:06:29.770 --> 01:06:33.410
So he's about to throw the cuffs
on him and put him in jail.

01:06:33.490 --> 01:06:37.370
All of a sudden, 50 yards down the road,
there's this huge fuckin' boom.

01:06:37.450 --> 01:06:40.810
- Statie gets real spooked.
He turns around- - He got shot?

01:06:40.890 --> 01:06:43.730
No. So- So- You
heard this story before.

01:06:43.770 --> 01:06:45.650
Yeah, Morgan, stop.
Stop.

01:06:45.690 --> 01:06:48.890
Some other guy's car had hit a tree.
There was an accident.

01:06:48.970 --> 01:06:50.810
Anyway-

01:06:50.890 --> 01:06:52.930
- How could he hear-
- Shut the fuck up!

01:06:53.010 --> 01:06:55.850
- You're drivin' him nuts.
- I'm gonna break your neck. Shut up!

01:06:55.930 --> 01:06:57.810
He told you the story
once before.

01:06:57.850 --> 01:07:00.450
So he tells my uncle,
"Stay here. Don't move. "

01:07:00.530 --> 01:07:04.290
Statie goes runnin' down the road
to deal with the other accident.

01:07:04.370 --> 01:07:08.130
After a few minutes of just
lyin' in his own piss and vomit,

01:07:08.210 --> 01:07:10.130
my uncle starts wonderin'
what he's doin' there.

01:07:10.170 --> 01:07:12.610
Gets up, gets in his car
and just drives home.

01:07:12.690 --> 01:07:15.570
The next mornin'
my uncle's just passed out.

01:07:15.610 --> 01:07:17.810
He hears this knockin' at the door.

01:07:17.850 --> 01:07:20.690
So he goes downstairs,
pulls the door open- "What?"

01:07:20.730 --> 01:07:22.650
It's the state trooper
that pulled him over.

01:07:22.690 --> 01:07:24.570
Statie says,
"Fuck you mean, 'What?'

01:07:24.610 --> 01:07:28.010
You know what. I pulled you over
last night is what, and you took off. "

01:07:28.090 --> 01:07:30.530
He's like, "I never
seen you before in my life.

01:07:30.610 --> 01:07:33.210
I've been home all night with my kids.
I don't know who the fuck you are. "

01:07:33.290 --> 01:07:36.450
He's like, "You know who I am.
Let me get in your garage. "

01:07:36.530 --> 01:07:38.770
My uncle's like, "What?" He said, "You
heard me. Let me get in your garage. "

01:07:38.810 --> 01:07:41.370
He was like, "All right. Fine. " Takes
him out to the garage, opens the door.

01:07:41.450 --> 01:07:46.450
And there's- The statie's police
cruiser is in my uncle's garage.

01:07:46.490 --> 01:07:48.890
He was so fuckin'-

01:07:48.970 --> 01:07:51.330
He was so fuckin' hammered
he drove the wrong car home.

01:07:51.410 --> 01:07:55.010
The best part about it is,
the fuckin' state trooper...

01:07:55.090 --> 01:07:57.410
was so embarrassed
he didn't do anything.

01:07:57.490 --> 01:08:00.690
He'd been drivin' around all night in my
uncle's Chevelle, lookin' for the house.

01:08:00.730 --> 01:08:04.610
All right, Chuck, what the fuck
is the point of your story?

01:08:04.690 --> 01:08:06.810
He got away.
That's the point.

01:08:06.890 --> 01:08:09.930
- Well, question-
- Come on. Stop.

01:08:10.010 --> 01:08:12.690
- I'm tryin' to clarify somethin'.
- You're embarrassing him.

01:08:12.730 --> 01:08:15.130
- It doesn't make any sense.
- It does make sense,

01:08:15.210 --> 01:08:17.090
if you listen to the story
and quit askin' questions.

01:08:17.170 --> 01:08:20.370
Well, let's see if you can get this one.
I've got a little story for you.

01:08:20.410 --> 01:08:24.970
All right, there's an old couple
in bed, Mary and Paddie.

01:08:25.050 --> 01:08:30.370
They wake up on the morning
of their 50th anniversary.

01:08:30.450 --> 01:08:33.450
Mary looks over and
gazes adoringly at Paddie.

01:08:33.529 --> 01:08:35.490
She's like,
"Oh, Jesus, Paddie.

01:08:35.569 --> 01:08:37.729
You're such a good-looking
feller. I love ya.

01:08:37.810 --> 01:08:40.090
I want to give ya
a little present.

01:08:40.130 --> 01:08:42.970
Anything your little heart desires,
I'm goin' to give it to ya.

01:08:43.050 --> 01:08:44.890
What would ya like?

01:08:44.970 --> 01:08:49.450
Paddie's like, "Oh, gee, Mary.
That's a very sweet offer.

01:08:49.529 --> 01:08:54.250
Now, in 50 years, there's one thing
that's been missing,

01:08:54.330 --> 01:08:57.930
and, uh, I would like you
to give me a blow job.

01:08:58.010 --> 01:09:01.529
I would like for it. "
Mary's like, "All right. "

01:09:01.609 --> 01:09:05.850
She takes her teeth out, puts 'em in
the glass. She gives him a blow job.

01:09:05.930 --> 01:09:09.689
Afterwards, Paddie's like, "Yeah, geez,
now that's what I've been missin'.

01:09:09.770 --> 01:09:13.529
That was the most beautiful,
earth-shattering thing ever!

01:09:13.569 --> 01:09:15.810
Beautiful, Mary!
I love ya!

01:09:15.890 --> 01:09:18.689
Is there anything
that I can do for you?"

01:09:18.770 --> 01:09:23.210
Mary looks up to him and she goes,
"Give us a kiss. "

01:09:23.290 --> 01:09:25.490
- Oh!
- Oh, my God!

01:09:25.529 --> 01:09:28.810
- That's filthy.
- It's not that filthy. I've heard filthy.

01:09:33.050 --> 01:09:36.850
- Get off of me!
- All right. See you guys later.

01:09:36.930 --> 01:09:40.050
All right.
Take it easy, Bill.

01:09:40.130 --> 01:09:42.490
So, Skylar,
thanks for comin' by.

01:09:42.569 --> 01:09:44.450
Changed my opinion
of Harvard people.

01:09:44.529 --> 01:09:47.850
You don't want to rush to judgment on
that one, 'cause they're not all like me.

01:09:47.930 --> 01:09:50.529
Oh. I'm sure.
It was nice to meet ya.

01:09:50.609 --> 01:09:53.170
- Oh.
- Take it easy. Slowly back away.

01:09:53.210 --> 01:09:57.170
- Oh, come on. Brother.
- I don't know what you're doin', dude.

01:09:57.210 --> 01:09:59.770
- You're givin' us a ride.
- What the fuck do I look like to you?

01:09:59.850 --> 01:10:03.130
- Come on, Chuck.
- You're walkin', bitch. Will's takin' the car.

01:10:03.210 --> 01:10:06.290
All right, thanks, sucker.
I appreciate it.

01:10:06.370 --> 01:10:09.170
I don't know what you're
gettin' all serious about.

01:10:09.210 --> 01:10:12.970
- You're droppin' me off first.
- It's really out of the way.

01:10:13.050 --> 01:10:15.810
Oh, okay. Just 'cause you don't have to
sleep in your one-room palace tonight...

01:10:15.890 --> 01:10:17.730
don't start
thinkin' you're bad.

01:10:17.810 --> 01:10:19.970
Hey, wait a minute. You said
we were gonna see your place.

01:10:20.050 --> 01:10:23.050
- Not tonight.
- Oh, no, not tonight. Not any other night.

01:10:23.130 --> 01:10:26.570
He knows once you see that shit-hole
he's gettin' dropped like a bad habit.

01:10:26.650 --> 01:10:28.570
But I wanted to meet
your brothers.

01:10:28.650 --> 01:10:30.970
We're gonna do that
another time.

01:10:31.050 --> 01:10:32.890
All right.

01:10:34.690 --> 01:10:36.930
Need them keys.

01:10:37.010 --> 01:10:40.850
The stewardess hears this
and goes haulin' ass down the aisle.

01:10:40.930 --> 01:10:44.130
I yell,
"Don't forget the coffee. "

01:10:44.210 --> 01:10:46.130
No shit!
You didn't say that.

01:10:46.210 --> 01:10:48.530
For Christ's sake, Marty,
it's a joke.

01:10:48.570 --> 01:10:50.650
- I know someone that actually happened to, Marty.
- A joke.

01:10:50.730 --> 01:10:52.250
- Gerry.
- Hi.

01:10:52.330 --> 01:10:54.210
- Have trouble findin' the place?
- No, I took a cab.

01:10:54.290 --> 01:10:58.010
Timmy, this is Gerry.
We went to college together.

01:10:58.050 --> 01:11:00.130
How you doin'?
Nice to meet ya.

01:11:00.210 --> 01:11:02.050
- Pleased to meet you.
- Can I get you a beer?

01:11:02.130 --> 01:11:04.490
Um, no, just a Perrier.

01:11:04.570 --> 01:11:06.410
That's French
for club soda.

01:11:06.490 --> 01:11:08.970
- Club soda, yeah.
- Couple of sandwiches too.

01:11:09.050 --> 01:11:10.890
- Sure.
- Put it on my tab.

01:11:10.970 --> 01:11:13.130
You ever plannin'
on payin' your tab?

01:11:13.210 --> 01:11:15.290
Yeah, chief, got the winning
lottery ticket right here.

01:11:15.370 --> 01:11:16.970
- What's the jackpot?
- Twelve million.

01:11:17.050 --> 01:11:21.610
- I don't think that'll cover it.
- It'll cover your sex change operation.

01:11:24.770 --> 01:11:28.450
- Nuts?
- No, thank you.

01:11:30.930 --> 01:11:33.890
So, you wanted
to talk about Will.

01:11:33.970 --> 01:11:37.690
- Well, it seems to be going well.
- I think so.

01:11:39.010 --> 01:11:41.730
Have you talked to him
at all about his future?

01:11:41.810 --> 01:11:45.370
No, we haven't gotten into that yet.
We're still bangin' away at the past.

01:11:45.410 --> 01:11:48.810
Maybe you should. My phone's been
ringing off the hook with job offers.

01:11:48.890 --> 01:11:52.610
- What kind?
- Cutting edge mathematics, think tanks.

01:11:52.690 --> 01:11:55.890
The kind of place where a mind
like Will's is given free rein.

01:11:55.970 --> 01:12:01.370
That's great that there are offers, but
I don't really think he's ready for that.

01:12:04.970 --> 01:12:07.090
I'm not sure
you understand, Sean.

01:12:07.170 --> 01:12:09.810
- What don't I understand?
- Here you go, guys.

01:12:09.890 --> 01:12:12.930
- Thanks, Tim.
- Yeah, thank you.

01:12:13.010 --> 01:12:15.250
Just so you don't
get sticky fingers.

01:12:15.330 --> 01:12:17.690
Tim, can you help us?

01:12:17.730 --> 01:12:20.090
We're tryin'
to settle a bet.

01:12:20.130 --> 01:12:21.490
Uh-oh.

01:12:21.570 --> 01:12:24.850
- Ever heard of Jonas Salk?
- Sure. Cured polio.

01:12:24.930 --> 01:12:27.490
- Ever heard of Albert Einstein?
- Hey.

01:12:29.650 --> 01:12:32.730
How about Gerald Lambeau?
Ever heard of him?

01:12:32.810 --> 01:12:36.410
- No.
- Thank you, Tim.

01:12:36.450 --> 01:12:38.330
- So who won the bet?
- I did.

01:12:40.290 --> 01:12:44.530
This isn't about me, Sean.

01:12:44.610 --> 01:12:47.330
I'm nothing compared
to this young man.

01:12:50.690 --> 01:12:52.570
You ever hear of
Gerald Lambeau?

01:12:52.610 --> 01:12:57.090
In 1905 there were hundreds of professors
renown for their study of the universe.

01:12:57.170 --> 01:13:01.530
But it was a 26-year-old
Swiss patent clerk,

01:13:01.570 --> 01:13:04.090
doing physics in his spare time,
who changed the world.

01:13:04.170 --> 01:13:06.050
Can you imagine if Einstein
would have given that up...

01:13:06.090 --> 01:13:08.530
just to get drunk with his buddies
in Vienna every night.

01:13:08.610 --> 01:13:11.130
We all would have
lost something.

01:13:11.170 --> 01:13:13.090
Tim would never
have heard of him.

01:13:13.170 --> 01:13:16.130
- Pretty dramatic, Gerry.
- No, it isn't, Sean.

01:13:16.210 --> 01:13:18.690
This boy has that gift.

01:13:18.770 --> 01:13:21.170
He just doesn't got the direction,
but we can give that to him.

01:13:21.250 --> 01:13:26.330
Hey, Gerry, in the 1960s, there was a young
man graduated from University of Michigan.

01:13:26.370 --> 01:13:29.530
Did some brilliant work
in mathematics.

01:13:29.570 --> 01:13:31.930
Specifically,
bounded harmonic functions.

01:13:31.970 --> 01:13:34.930
Then he went on to Berkeley. He was
assistant professor. Showed amazing potential.

01:13:35.010 --> 01:13:37.810
Then he moved to Montana, and
he blew the competition away.

01:13:37.890 --> 01:13:40.690
- Yeah, so who was he?
- Ted Kaczynski.

01:13:40.770 --> 01:13:42.530
Haven't heard of him.

01:13:42.610 --> 01:13:44.450
- Hey, Timmy!
- Yo!

01:13:44.530 --> 01:13:47.170
- Who's Ted Kaczynski?
- Unabomber.

01:13:49.010 --> 01:13:51.970
That's exactly
what I'm talking about.

01:13:52.050 --> 01:13:53.890
- We gotta give this kid direction.
- Yeah-

01:13:53.970 --> 01:13:56.250
He can contribute to the world,
and we can help him do that.

01:13:56.290 --> 01:13:58.290
Direction's one thing.
Manipulation's another.

01:13:58.370 --> 01:14:01.090
- Sean-
- We have to let him find-

01:14:01.170 --> 01:14:03.770
I'm not sitting at home every night
twisting my mustache and hatching a plan...

01:14:03.850 --> 01:14:05.730
to ruin this boy's life!

01:14:05.810 --> 01:14:08.130
I was doing advanced mathematics
when I was 18,

01:14:08.170 --> 01:14:10.530
and it still took me over 20 years to do
something worthy of a Field's medal.

01:14:10.610 --> 01:14:12.930
Maybe he doesn't want
what you want.

01:14:13.010 --> 01:14:15.650
There's more to life
than a fuckin' Field's medal.

01:14:15.730 --> 01:14:19.490
This is too important, Sean,
and it's above personal rivalry.

01:14:19.570 --> 01:14:21.890
Wait a minute.
Let's talk about the boy.

01:14:21.970 --> 01:14:24.570
Why don't we give him time
to figure out what he wants?

01:14:24.650 --> 01:14:27.770
That's a wonderful theory, Sean.
It worked wonders for you, didn't it?

01:14:27.850 --> 01:14:30.370
Yeah, it did,
you arrogant fuckin' prick!

01:14:31.730 --> 01:14:35.010
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry
that I came here today.

01:14:35.090 --> 01:14:37.170
I came here out of courtesy.
I wanted to keep you in the loop.

01:14:37.250 --> 01:14:39.290
Nice to be in the loop.

01:14:39.330 --> 01:14:42.810
The boy's in a meeting right now
I set up for him over at McNeil.

01:14:42.850 --> 01:14:47.130
Well, Will, I'm not exactly sure
what you mean.

01:14:47.170 --> 01:14:49.450
We've already
offered you a position.

01:14:49.530 --> 01:14:51.450
Nobody in this town works
without a retainer, guys.

01:14:51.530 --> 01:14:54.650
You think you can find somebody
who does, you have my blessin'.

01:14:54.730 --> 01:14:57.850
But I think we all know that person is
not gonna represent you as well as I can.

01:14:57.930 --> 01:15:00.930
Will, our offer
is $84,000 a year.

01:15:01.010 --> 01:15:05.530
Retainer!
Retainer.

01:15:05.610 --> 01:15:08.250
You want us to give you
cash right now?

01:15:08.330 --> 01:15:12.250
Whoa-ho-ho. Easy-
Now, I didn't say that.

01:15:12.290 --> 01:15:17.330
Allegedly,
your situation, for you,

01:15:17.410 --> 01:15:21.090
would be concurrently
improved if I had...

01:15:21.130 --> 01:15:23.690
$200 in my back pocket
right now.

01:15:23.770 --> 01:15:28.570
I don't think I can- Larry?

01:15:28.650 --> 01:15:32.690
- I've got $73.
- Will you take a check?

01:15:32.770 --> 01:15:37.330
Let me tell you somethin'.
You're suspect.

01:15:37.410 --> 01:15:42.530
Yeah, you. I don't know
what your reputation is in this town,

01:15:42.570 --> 01:15:45.210
but after the shit
you tried to pull today,

01:15:45.250 --> 01:15:47.770
you can bet
I'll be lookin' into you.

01:15:47.810 --> 01:15:52.570
Now, any business
we have heretofore,

01:15:52.610 --> 01:15:56.290
you can speak with
my aforementioned attorney.

01:15:56.330 --> 01:15:58.410
Good day, gentlemen.

01:15:58.490 --> 01:16:02.050
And until that day comes,
keep your ear to the grindstone.

01:16:15.810 --> 01:16:17.650
- How's it goin'?
- Fine.

01:16:17.730 --> 01:16:19.690
Yeah.

01:16:19.770 --> 01:16:21.610
Good.

01:16:22.650 --> 01:16:25.170
- Want some help?
- No!

01:16:25.250 --> 01:16:28.290
Come on. Give me one little peek,
and we'll go to the batting cages.

01:16:28.370 --> 01:16:30.490
No.

01:16:30.530 --> 01:16:34.050
It is actually important
that I learn this.

01:16:34.130 --> 01:16:37.730
- It's really important... to me, okay?
- All right.

01:16:37.810 --> 01:16:42.530
- Why don't we just hang out here all day?
- Yes, why don't we?

01:16:44.810 --> 01:16:48.330
All right, Mr. Nosey Parker.

01:16:48.410 --> 01:16:52.970
Seeing as you're intent
on breaking my balls,

01:16:53.050 --> 01:16:56.490
- let me ask you a question.
- All right.

01:16:56.570 --> 01:16:58.450
Do you have
a photographic memory?

01:17:00.530 --> 01:17:04.290
I don't know. I just kind of remember. I
mean, how do you remember your phone number?

01:17:04.330 --> 01:17:06.210
You just do.

01:17:06.250 --> 01:17:09.050
- Have you studied organic chemistry?
- A little bit.

01:17:09.090 --> 01:17:11.890
- Oh, just for fun?
- Yeah, for kicks.

01:17:11.970 --> 01:17:14.410
Yeah, it's so much fun
studying organic chemistry.

01:17:14.490 --> 01:17:17.010
Are you mad?

01:17:17.090 --> 01:17:19.490
Have you completely
lost your mind?

01:17:19.570 --> 01:17:23.970
Nobody studies it for fun. It's not a
necessity, especially for someone like you.

01:17:24.050 --> 01:17:26.410
- Someone like me?
- Yeah.

01:17:26.490 --> 01:17:30.570
Someone who divides their time, fairly
evenly, between batting cages and bars.

01:17:30.650 --> 01:17:34.970
- I would hardly say it was a necessity.
- Oh.

01:17:35.050 --> 01:17:37.730
You know, there are very
smart people here at Harvard.

01:17:37.810 --> 01:17:41.610
Even they have to study,
because this is really hard.

01:17:41.690 --> 01:17:47.130
And yet... you do it
so easily. I don't understand.

01:17:47.210 --> 01:17:49.210
I don't understand
how your mind works.

01:17:49.250 --> 01:17:51.410
- Did you play the piano?
- I want to talk about this.

01:17:51.490 --> 01:17:53.530
No, I'm trying to explain it to you.
Do you play the piano?

01:17:53.610 --> 01:17:58.010
- Yeah, a bit.
- So when you look at a piano, you see Mozart.

01:17:58.050 --> 01:18:01.530
- I see "Chopsticks. "
- All right, well, Beethoven, okay?

01:18:01.570 --> 01:18:05.210
He looked at a piano, and it just
made sense to him. He could just play.

01:18:05.330 --> 01:18:07.530
- So what are you saying? You play the piano?
- Not a lick.

01:18:07.570 --> 01:18:11.290
I look at a piano, I see a bunch of
keys, three pedals and a box of wood.

01:18:11.370 --> 01:18:15.970
But Beethoven, Mozart-
They saw it. They could just play.

01:18:16.050 --> 01:18:19.850
I couldn't paint you a picture. I
probably can't hit the ball out of Fenway.

01:18:19.890 --> 01:18:25.130
- And I can't play the piano. - But you
can do my O- chem paper in under an hour.

01:18:25.170 --> 01:18:30.490
Right. Well, I mean, when it came to
stuff like that, I could always just play.

01:18:31.810 --> 01:18:33.690
That's the best
I can explain it.

01:18:33.770 --> 01:18:37.610
- Come here. I have to tell you something.
- Huh?

01:18:37.650 --> 01:18:40.330
- I have to tell you something.
- Oh.

01:18:40.370 --> 01:18:42.250
Well-

01:18:56.170 --> 01:19:00.650
- It's not fair.
- What's not fair? What?

01:19:00.690 --> 01:19:03.690
I've been here for four years,

01:19:03.730 --> 01:19:07.050
and I've only just found you.

01:19:07.090 --> 01:19:09.370
Well, you found me.

01:19:20.690 --> 01:19:24.370
- Are you awake?
- No.

01:19:25.610 --> 01:19:27.690
Yes, you are.

01:19:34.930 --> 01:19:36.810
What?

01:19:38.730 --> 01:19:41.730
I want you to come
to California with me.

01:19:46.290 --> 01:19:50.850
- You sure about that?
- Oh, yeah.

01:19:50.930 --> 01:19:53.890
Yeah, but how do you know?

01:19:53.970 --> 01:19:57.930
I don't know.
I just know.

01:19:58.010 --> 01:20:00.650
Yeah, but how do you know?

01:20:00.730 --> 01:20:03.690
I know because I feel it.

01:20:03.730 --> 01:20:08.410
- Because that's a really serious thing you're saying.
- I know.

01:20:08.490 --> 01:20:10.850
You could be in California
next week...

01:20:10.930 --> 01:20:13.970
and you might find out
something about me you don't like.

01:20:14.050 --> 01:20:16.010
Maybe you wish
you hadn't said that,

01:20:16.090 --> 01:20:18.370
but you know it's such a serious thing
you can't take it back.

01:20:18.450 --> 01:20:21.450
Now I'm stuck in California with someone
that doesn't really want to be with me,

01:20:21.490 --> 01:20:25.850
- just wish they had a take-back.
- A what? What's a take-back?

01:20:25.930 --> 01:20:31.570
I don't want a take-back. I just want
you to come to California with me.

01:20:31.650 --> 01:20:35.210
Well, I can't go to
California with you, so-

01:20:36.250 --> 01:20:38.130
Why not?

01:20:38.170 --> 01:20:42.130
Well, one, because
I got a job here.

01:20:42.210 --> 01:20:45.330
And, two,
because I live here.

01:20:45.410 --> 01:20:49.730
Look, um, if you don't love me,
you should just tell me.

01:20:49.810 --> 01:20:51.650
I'm not sayin'
I don't love you.

01:20:51.730 --> 01:20:56.690
Then why? Why won't you come?
What are you so scared of?

01:20:56.770 --> 01:20:59.570
What am I so scared of?

01:20:59.610 --> 01:21:02.250
Well, what aren't
you scared of?

01:21:02.330 --> 01:21:05.170
You live in this safe little world
where no one challenges you-

01:21:05.250 --> 01:21:09.010
Don't tell me about my world.
Don't tell me about my world.

01:21:09.050 --> 01:21:11.530
You just want to have your little fling
with the guy from the other side of town.

01:21:11.570 --> 01:21:14.290
Then you're gonna go off to Stanford.
You're gonna marry some rich prick...

01:21:14.370 --> 01:21:16.210
who your parents
will approve of...

01:21:16.290 --> 01:21:18.210
and just sit around with
the other trust fund babies...

01:21:18.290 --> 01:21:21.010
and talk about how you
went slummin', too, once.

01:21:21.050 --> 01:21:25.290
Why are you saying this?
What is your obsession with this money?

01:21:25.330 --> 01:21:29.650
My father died when I was 13,
and I inherited this money.

01:21:29.730 --> 01:21:34.930
You don't think every day I wake up,
and I wish I could give it back.

01:21:34.970 --> 01:21:38.490
That I would give it back in a second if
it meant I could have one more day with him.

01:21:38.570 --> 01:21:41.810
But I can't, and that's
my life, and I deal with it.

01:21:41.890 --> 01:21:45.610
So don't put your shit on me
when you're the one that's afraid.

01:21:45.650 --> 01:21:47.530
I'm afraid? What am I afraid of?
What the fuck am I afraid of?

01:21:47.570 --> 01:21:50.010
You're afraid of me. You're afraid
that I won't love you back.

01:21:50.090 --> 01:21:52.170
You know what?
I'm afraid too.

01:21:52.250 --> 01:21:55.250
But fuck it, I want to give it a shot.
At least I'm honest with you.

01:21:55.330 --> 01:21:59.010
- I'm not honest with you?
- No, what about your 12 brothers?

01:21:59.090 --> 01:22:01.290
All right.

01:22:01.370 --> 01:22:03.410
No, you're not going.
You're not leaving.

01:22:03.490 --> 01:22:07.450
What do you want to know? That I don't
have 12 brothers? That I'm a fuckin' orphan?

01:22:07.530 --> 01:22:09.490
- You don't want to hear that.
- I didn't know that.

01:22:09.570 --> 01:22:12.650
You don't want to hear I got fuckin'
cigarettes put out on me when I was little.

01:22:12.730 --> 01:22:15.050
- I didn't know that.
- That this isn't fuckin' surgery.

01:22:15.090 --> 01:22:17.930
The motherfucker stabbed me. You don't
want to hear that shit, Skylar!

01:22:17.970 --> 01:22:20.170
- I do want to hear that.
- Don't tell me you want that shit!

01:22:20.250 --> 01:22:23.290
- I want to help you.
- Help me? What the fuck?

01:22:23.370 --> 01:22:26.010
What do I got, a fuckin' sign
on my back that says, "Save me"?

01:22:26.090 --> 01:22:27.930
- No.
- Do I look like I need that?

01:22:28.010 --> 01:22:29.930
- No, I just want to be with you-
- Don't bullshit me!

01:22:30.010 --> 01:22:33.850
- I love you.
- Don't bullshit me! Don't you fuckin' bullshit me!

01:22:33.930 --> 01:22:36.730
I love you.

01:22:36.810 --> 01:22:41.610
I want to hear you say
that you don't love me.

01:22:41.690 --> 01:22:45.610
Because if you say that...

01:22:45.690 --> 01:22:48.970
then I won't call you...

01:22:49.010 --> 01:22:52.970
and I won't be in your life.

01:22:56.650 --> 01:22:59.250
I don't love you.

01:23:38.530 --> 01:23:42.570
Most people never get to see
how brilliant they can be.

01:23:42.610 --> 01:23:45.290
They don't find teachers
that believe in them.

01:23:45.330 --> 01:23:48.810
They get convinced
they're stupid.

01:23:48.890 --> 01:23:51.730
I hope you appreciate
what he's doing,

01:23:51.810 --> 01:23:55.010
because I've seen how much
he enjoys working with you,

01:23:55.090 --> 01:23:57.930
not against you.

01:24:01.010 --> 01:24:03.530
Hello, Will.

01:24:03.570 --> 01:24:05.770
Tom, can you get us
some coffee?

01:24:05.850 --> 01:24:07.730
Sure.

01:24:11.090 --> 01:24:14.090
Now, let's see.

01:24:18.850 --> 01:24:21.930
Good. This is correct.

01:24:23.370 --> 01:24:25.650
I see you used Maclaurin here.

01:24:25.730 --> 01:24:28.650
Yeah, I don't know what
you call it, but-

01:24:28.730 --> 01:24:32.810
This can't be right.

01:24:33.850 --> 01:24:36.650
This would be
very embarrassing.

01:24:39.530 --> 01:24:42.450
- Did you ever consider-
- I'm pretty sure it's right.

01:24:42.530 --> 01:24:44.610
Hey, look, can we do this
at Sean's office from now on?

01:24:44.690 --> 01:24:48.650
Because I got to knock off work to come
here and the commute is killin' me.

01:24:48.690 --> 01:24:52.170
- Yeah, sure. Did you think of
the possibility- - That's right.

01:24:52.250 --> 01:24:57.250
It's right.
Just take it home with you.

01:25:00.290 --> 01:25:02.170
What happened
at the McNeil meeting?

01:25:02.250 --> 01:25:04.170
I couldn't go.
I had a date.

01:25:04.210 --> 01:25:07.210
So I sent my
chief negotiator.

01:25:10.890 --> 01:25:14.450
On your own time, you can do
whatever you like, Will.

01:25:14.530 --> 01:25:17.050
But when I set up a meeting
with my associates,

01:25:17.130 --> 01:25:19.690
and you don't show up,
it reflects poorly on me.

01:25:19.730 --> 01:25:21.850
- Then don't set up any more meetings.
- I won't.

01:25:21.930 --> 01:25:24.250
I'll cancel 'em.

01:25:24.330 --> 01:25:27.730
I'll give you a job myself. I just
wanted you to see what was out there.

01:25:27.890 --> 01:25:30.850
Maybe I don't want to spend the rest of
my fuckin' life explainin' shit to people.

01:25:37.650 --> 01:25:39.970
I think you could show me
some appreciation.

01:25:40.050 --> 01:25:44.290
A little appreciation?
Do you know how easy this is for me?

01:25:44.370 --> 01:25:47.530
Do you have any fuckin' idea how easy
this is? This is a fuckin' joke.

01:25:47.610 --> 01:25:49.610
I'm sorry you can't do this-
I really am-

01:25:49.690 --> 01:25:54.930
Because I wouldn't have to fuckin' sit here
and watch you fumble around and fuck it up.

01:25:58.250 --> 01:26:01.730
Then you'd have more time to sit around
and get drunk instead, wouldn't you?

01:26:01.810 --> 01:26:06.210
You're right. This is probably
a total waste of my time.

01:26:19.730 --> 01:26:21.770
You're right, Will.

01:26:23.930 --> 01:26:28.330
I can't do this proof,
but you can.

01:26:28.410 --> 01:26:32.290
And when it comes to that, it's only about
just a handful of people in the world...

01:26:32.370 --> 01:26:34.410
who can tell the difference
between you and me.

01:26:34.450 --> 01:26:36.650
- But I'm one of them.
- Sorry.

01:26:36.690 --> 01:26:38.690
Yeah, so am I.

01:26:38.770 --> 01:26:43.690
Most days I wish
I never met you,

01:26:43.770 --> 01:26:46.290
because then I could
sleep at night.

01:26:46.370 --> 01:26:52.010
I didn't have to walk around with the knowledge
that there was someone like you out there.

01:26:58.130 --> 01:27:02.370
I didn't have to watch you
throw it all away.

01:27:08.290 --> 01:27:13.450
Bill, hold it. Did you hear that?

01:27:13.490 --> 01:27:15.370
Morgan!

01:27:15.410 --> 01:27:20.650
If you're watchin' pornos in my mom's room
again, I'm gonna give you a fuckin' beatin'!

01:27:35.930 --> 01:27:38.850
What's up, fellas?

01:27:38.930 --> 01:27:43.330
Morgan, why don't you jerk off in your
own fuckin' house. That's fuckin' filthy.

01:27:43.410 --> 01:27:47.370
I don't have a V.C.R.
in my house.

01:27:47.450 --> 01:27:50.010
Come on. Not in my glove.

01:27:50.090 --> 01:27:52.370
I didn't use the glove.

01:27:52.450 --> 01:27:55.850
That's my
Little League glove.

01:27:55.930 --> 01:27:59.210
What do you want me
to do?

01:27:59.290 --> 01:28:01.330
I mean, what's wrong
with you?

01:28:01.410 --> 01:28:03.490
You'll hump
a baseball glove?

01:28:03.570 --> 01:28:06.570
I- I just used it
for cleanup.

01:28:06.650 --> 01:28:10.210
Stop jerkin' off in my mother's room.

01:28:10.290 --> 01:28:13.290
- Is there another V.C.R. in the house?
- It's just sad, bro.

01:28:14.970 --> 01:28:19.650
So why do you think I should work
for the National Security Agency?

01:28:19.730 --> 01:28:22.690
Well, you'd be working
on the cutting edge.

01:28:22.770 --> 01:28:26.010
You'd be exposed to the kind of
technology you wouldn't see anywhere else,

01:28:26.090 --> 01:28:28.570
because we've classified it.

01:28:28.650 --> 01:28:32.170
Superstring theory,
chaos math, advanced algorithms.

01:28:32.210 --> 01:28:35.050
Code breaking.

01:28:35.090 --> 01:28:37.770
That's one aspect
of what we do.

01:28:37.850 --> 01:28:40.370
Oh, come on.
That is what you do.

01:28:40.450 --> 01:28:42.770
You guys handle 80% of
the intelligence workload.

01:28:42.850 --> 01:28:45.250
You're seven times
the size of the C.I.A.

01:28:45.330 --> 01:28:50.890
We don't like to brag about that, Will,
but you're exactly right.

01:28:50.970 --> 01:28:54.690
So the way I see it,
the question isn't:

01:28:54.770 --> 01:28:57.290
"Why should you work
for the N.S.A.?"

01:28:57.370 --> 01:28:59.730
The question is:
"Why shouldn't you?"

01:28:59.810 --> 01:29:03.530
Why shouldn't
I work for the N.S.A.?

01:29:03.610 --> 01:29:07.370
That's a tough one,
but I'll take a shot.

01:29:07.450 --> 01:29:10.090
Say I'm workin' at the N.S.A.
and somebody puts a code on my desk.

01:29:10.130 --> 01:29:12.010
Something no one else
can break.

01:29:12.050 --> 01:29:13.930
Maybe I take a shot at it
and maybe I break it.

01:29:13.970 --> 01:29:16.410
I'm real happy with myself
because I did my job well.

01:29:16.490 --> 01:29:19.890
But maybe that code was the location of some
rebel army in North Africa or Middle East.

01:29:19.970 --> 01:29:22.890
Once they have that location, they bomb
the village where the rebels are hidin'.

01:29:22.970 --> 01:29:27.050
Fifteen hundred people that I never met,
never had no problem with, get killed.

01:29:27.090 --> 01:29:29.970
Now the politicians are saying, "Send in
the Marines to secure the area,"

01:29:30.010 --> 01:29:31.850
'cause they don't give a shit.

01:29:31.930 --> 01:29:33.770
It won't be their kid
over there gettin' shot,

01:29:33.850 --> 01:29:36.690
just like it wasn't them when their number got
called 'cause they were in the National Guard.

01:29:36.770 --> 01:29:39.530
It'll be some kid from Southie
over there takin' shrapnel in the ass.

01:29:39.570 --> 01:29:41.490
He comes back to find the plant
he used to work at...

01:29:41.570 --> 01:29:43.930
got exported to the country
he got back from,

01:29:44.010 --> 01:29:46.250
and the guy who put the shrapnel
in his ass got his old job...

01:29:46.290 --> 01:29:49.050
'cause he'll work for 15 cents
a day and no bathroom breaks.

01:29:49.130 --> 01:29:51.610
Meanwhile, he realizes the only reason
he was over there in the first place...

01:29:51.690 --> 01:29:54.690
was so we could install a government
that would sell us oil at a good price.

01:29:54.730 --> 01:29:58.610
Of course, the oil companies used a skirmish
over there to scare up domestic oil prices.

01:29:58.690 --> 01:30:02.610
A cute little ancillary benefit for them, but
it ain't helpin' my buddy at 2.50 a gallon.

01:30:02.690 --> 01:30:04.930
They're takin' their sweet time
bringin' the oil, of course.

01:30:05.010 --> 01:30:07.050
Maybe they even took the liberty
to hire an alcoholic skipper,

01:30:07.090 --> 01:30:10.170
who likes to drink martinis and fuckin'
play slalom with the icebergs.

01:30:10.250 --> 01:30:12.410
It ain't too long till
he hits one, spills the oil...

01:30:12.490 --> 01:30:14.850
and kills all the sea life
in the North Atlantic.

01:30:14.890 --> 01:30:17.130
So now my buddy's out of work,
he can't afford to drive,

01:30:17.170 --> 01:30:19.050
so he's walkin' to
the fuckin' job interviews...

01:30:19.090 --> 01:30:21.770
which sucks because the shrapnel in his
ass is givin' him chronic hemorrhoids.

01:30:21.810 --> 01:30:24.250
Meanwhile, he's starvin', 'cause every
time he tries to get a bite to eat,

01:30:24.330 --> 01:30:26.170
the only blue plate special
they're servin'...

01:30:26.250 --> 01:30:29.050
is North Atlantic scrod
with Quaker State.

01:30:29.130 --> 01:30:33.930
So what did I think?
I'm holdin' out for somethin' better.

01:30:34.010 --> 01:30:37.690
I figure, fuck it. While I'm at it,
why not just shoot my buddy,

01:30:37.770 --> 01:30:39.610
take his job,
give it to his sworn enemy,

01:30:39.690 --> 01:30:42.090
hike up gas prices, bomb
a village, club a baby seal,

01:30:42.170 --> 01:30:44.730
hit the hash pipe
and join the National Guard?

01:30:44.810 --> 01:30:47.250
I can be
elected president.

01:30:47.330 --> 01:30:50.450
- You feel like you're alone?
- What?

01:30:50.530 --> 01:30:54.010
Do you have a soul mate?

01:30:54.090 --> 01:30:56.490
Do I have a-
Define that.

01:30:56.570 --> 01:30:58.410
Somebody who challenges you.

01:30:58.490 --> 01:31:04.130
- Uh, Chuckie.
- No, Chuckie's family. He'd lie down in fuckin' traffic for you.

01:31:04.210 --> 01:31:09.610
I'm talking about someone who opens
up things for you, touches your soul.

01:31:09.690 --> 01:31:12.730
- I got- I got-
- Who?

01:31:12.810 --> 01:31:15.730
- I got plenty.
- Well, name 'em.

01:31:15.810 --> 01:31:18.690
Shakespeare, Nietzsche, Frost,
O'Connor, Kant, Pope, Locke-

01:31:18.770 --> 01:31:20.890
That's great.
They're all dead.

01:31:20.970 --> 01:31:23.970
- Not to me they're not.
- You don't have a lot of dialogue with them.

01:31:24.010 --> 01:31:27.290
You can't give back
to them, Will.

01:31:27.370 --> 01:31:31.530
- Not without some serious smelling salts and a heater.
- That's what I'm saying.

01:31:31.610 --> 01:31:35.010
You'll never have that kind
of relationship in a world...

01:31:35.090 --> 01:31:37.450
where you're always afraid
to take the first step,

01:31:37.490 --> 01:31:41.130
because all you see is every
negative thing ten miles down the road.

01:31:41.210 --> 01:31:43.170
- You gonna take the professor's side on this?
- Don't give me a line of shit.

01:31:43.210 --> 01:31:45.090
- No.
- I didn't want the job.

01:31:45.130 --> 01:31:47.050
It's not about the job. I don't care
if you work for the government.

01:31:47.090 --> 01:31:50.090
But you can do anything you want.
You are bound by nothing.

01:31:50.170 --> 01:31:55.010
What are you passionate about?
What do you want?

01:31:55.090 --> 01:31:57.330
There are guys who work
their entire life layin' brick...

01:31:57.410 --> 01:31:59.570
so their kids have a chance
at the opportunities you have here.

01:31:59.650 --> 01:32:02.050
- I didn't ask for this.
- No.

01:32:02.130 --> 01:32:04.490
You were born with it, so don't cop out
behind: "I didn't ask for this. "

01:32:04.530 --> 01:32:08.170
- What do you mean, cop out? What's wrong with layin' brick?
- Nothing.

01:32:08.250 --> 01:32:10.450
There's nothin' wrong.
That's somebody's home I'm buildin'.

01:32:10.530 --> 01:32:13.290
Right. My dad
laid brick, okay?

01:32:13.330 --> 01:32:15.210
Busted his ass so
I could have an education.

01:32:15.250 --> 01:32:17.370
Exactly. That's
an honorable profession.

01:32:17.450 --> 01:32:19.290
What's wrong with
fixin' somebody's car?

01:32:19.370 --> 01:32:21.210
Someone will get to work the next day
because of me. That's honor in that.

01:32:21.290 --> 01:32:23.130
Yeah, there is, Will.
There is honor in that.

01:32:23.210 --> 01:32:25.450
There's honor in takin'
that 40-minute train ride...

01:32:25.490 --> 01:32:27.890
so those college kids could come in in
the morning and their floors are clean.

01:32:27.970 --> 01:32:30.850
- And their wastebaskets are empty. That's real work.
- That's right.

01:32:30.930 --> 01:32:33.810
And that's honorable. I'm sure
that's why you took that job.

01:32:33.890 --> 01:32:35.810
I mean, for the honor of it.

01:32:35.890 --> 01:32:40.330
I just have a little question here.
You could be a janitor anywhere.

01:32:40.410 --> 01:32:43.970
Why did you work at the most prestigious
technical college in the whole fuckin' world?

01:32:44.050 --> 01:32:47.210
Why did you sneak around at night
and finish other people's formulas...

01:32:47.250 --> 01:32:52.930
that only one or two people in the world
could do and then lie about it?

01:32:53.010 --> 01:32:55.850
'Cause I don't see
a lot of honor in that, Will.

01:32:58.930 --> 01:33:01.450
So what do you
really wanna do?

01:33:04.690 --> 01:33:06.610
I wanna be a shepherd.

01:33:06.730 --> 01:33:08.450
Really?

01:33:08.530 --> 01:33:12.330
I wanna move up to Nashua, get a nice little
spread, get some sheep and tend to them.

01:33:12.410 --> 01:33:15.210
- Maybe you should go do that.
- What?

01:33:15.290 --> 01:33:18.130
You know, if you're gonna jerk off, why don't
you just do it at home with a moist towel?

01:33:18.170 --> 01:33:20.090
- You're chuckin' me?
- Yeah, get the fuck outta here.

01:33:20.130 --> 01:33:22.010
- No, no, no, time's not up yet.
- Yeah, it is.

01:33:22.090 --> 01:33:24.650
- I'm not leavin'. No.
- You're not gonna answer, you're wastin' my time.

01:33:24.730 --> 01:33:26.610
I thought we were friends.

01:33:26.650 --> 01:33:30.130
- Playtime's over, okay?
- Why are you kickin' me out?

01:33:30.210 --> 01:33:33.410
You're lecturin' me on life?
Look at you, you fuckin' burnout.

01:33:33.490 --> 01:33:35.610
- What winds your clock?
- Workin' with you.

01:33:35.690 --> 01:33:38.650
Where's your soul mate? You wanna
talk about soul mates? Where is she?

01:33:38.730 --> 01:33:40.770
- Dead.
- That's right. She's fuckin' dead.

01:33:40.850 --> 01:33:43.450
She fuckin' dies and you just cash in
your chips and you walk away?

01:33:43.530 --> 01:33:47.570
- At least I played a hand.
- You played a hand and you lost. You lost a big fuckin' hand.

01:33:47.610 --> 01:33:50.890
Some people will lose a big hand like
that and have the sack to ante up again.

01:33:50.970 --> 01:33:53.930
Look at me.
What do you wanna do?

01:34:00.570 --> 01:34:04.650
You and your bullshit.
You got a bullshit answer for everybody.

01:34:04.730 --> 01:34:08.290
But I ask you a very simple question and
you can't give me a straight answer,

01:34:08.370 --> 01:34:12.170
because you don't know.

01:34:13.770 --> 01:34:15.890
I'll see ya, Bo-peep.

01:34:18.730 --> 01:34:20.770
- Fuck you.
- You're the shepherd.

01:34:25.330 --> 01:34:27.450
Shepherd.

01:34:27.530 --> 01:34:29.530
White little prick.

01:34:30.730 --> 01:34:32.610
I just wanted to,
you know, um,

01:34:32.690 --> 01:34:36.050
call you up,
uh, before you left, um-

01:34:36.090 --> 01:34:38.610
I've been takin' all these
jobs interviews and stuff,

01:34:38.690 --> 01:34:40.570
so I'm not gonna be just
a construction worker.

01:34:40.610 --> 01:34:43.210
Well, you know, I never
really cared about that.

01:34:44.650 --> 01:34:46.530
Yeah.

01:34:49.010 --> 01:34:50.850
I love you.

01:34:55.010 --> 01:34:57.410
Will?

01:34:57.490 --> 01:35:00.210
You take care.

01:35:00.250 --> 01:35:03.690
% Someone's always
comin' around here %

01:35:03.770 --> 01:35:06.290
- % Trailin' some new kill %
- Bye.

01:35:08.370 --> 01:35:11.650
% Says, I seen your picture
on a %

01:35:11.730 --> 01:35:15.090
% Hundred-dollar bill %

01:35:15.170 --> 01:35:19.210
% What's a game of chance
to you %

01:35:19.290 --> 01:35:22.450
% In this world %

01:35:22.490 --> 01:35:24.530
% Of real skill %

01:35:24.570 --> 01:35:26.490
% So glad to meet ya %

01:35:26.570 --> 01:35:30.610
% Angeles %

01:35:32.290 --> 01:35:38.490
% Pickin' up the ticket

01:35:39.930 --> 01:35:42.010
% Go on, lose the gamble %

01:35:42.090 --> 01:35:46.450
% That's the history

01:35:46.530 --> 01:35:51.570
% Did you add up

% To zero %

01:35:55.610 --> 01:35:58.410

% Don't start with me

01:36:08.170 --> 01:36:10.770
Will, come on.
Will!

01:36:12.730 --> 01:36:14.770
Will, that's it!
We're done!

01:36:14.810 --> 01:36:19.370
I'm sitting in your office
and the boy isn't here.

01:36:19.450 --> 01:36:21.370
Well, it's ten past 5:00.

01:36:21.450 --> 01:36:23.410
An hour and
ten minutes late.

01:36:23.450 --> 01:36:26.650
% I can make you satisfied
in everything %

01:36:26.730 --> 01:36:30.090
Well, if he doesn't show up and I file
a report saying he wasn't here...

01:36:30.170 --> 01:36:33.890
and he goes back to jail,
he won't be on my conscience.

01:36:33.970 --> 01:36:36.730
% Now be coming true %%

01:36:36.770 --> 01:36:39.650
Okay. Fine.

01:36:41.130 --> 01:36:43.810
What's up?

01:36:44.850 --> 01:36:46.690
Thanks.

01:36:49.210 --> 01:36:52.970
Ah! God, that's good.

01:36:56.610 --> 01:36:59.010
So how's your lady?

01:36:59.090 --> 01:37:01.810
Ah, she's gone.

01:37:01.850 --> 01:37:04.090
Gone? Gone where?

01:37:04.170 --> 01:37:07.690
Med school.
Medical school in California.

01:37:07.770 --> 01:37:09.610
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:37:09.690 --> 01:37:12.530
- When was this?
- It was, like, a week ago.

01:37:16.730 --> 01:37:18.570
That sucks.

01:37:21.450 --> 01:37:24.850
So, uh, when are you done
with those meetings?

01:37:24.890 --> 01:37:26.850
I think the week
after I'm 21.

01:37:26.930 --> 01:37:29.530
They gonna hook ya up
with a job or what?

01:37:29.610 --> 01:37:33.650
Yeah, fuckin' sit in a room and do
long division for the next 50 years.

01:37:33.730 --> 01:37:37.010
Nah, probably make
some nice bank though.

01:37:37.050 --> 01:37:38.970
I'm gonna be
a fuckin' lab rat.

01:37:39.010 --> 01:37:42.250
Better than this shit.
Way outta here.

01:37:42.330 --> 01:37:44.450
What do I want a way
outta here for?

01:37:44.530 --> 01:37:46.690
I mean, I'm gonna fuckin'
live here the rest of my life.

01:37:46.770 --> 01:37:48.770
You know, be neighbors.
You know, have little kids.

01:37:48.850 --> 01:37:53.250
Fuckin' take 'em to Little League
together up Foley Field.

01:37:54.770 --> 01:37:58.010
Look, you're my best friend,
so don't take this the wrong way.

01:37:58.090 --> 01:38:00.890
But in 20 years if
you're still livin' here,

01:38:00.930 --> 01:38:04.050
comin' over to my house
to watch the Patriots games,

01:38:04.130 --> 01:38:06.330
still workin' construction,
I'll fuckin' kill ya.

01:38:06.410 --> 01:38:08.850
That's not a threat. That's a fact.
I'll fuckin' kill ya.

01:38:08.930 --> 01:38:11.010
What the fuck
are you talkin' about?

01:38:11.090 --> 01:38:14.130
- Look, you got something none of us have.
- Oh, come on!

01:38:14.210 --> 01:38:17.930
Why is it always this? I fuckin'
owe it to myself to do this or that.

01:38:18.010 --> 01:38:21.970
- What if I don't want to?
- No, no, no. Fuck you. You don't owe it to yourself.

01:38:22.050 --> 01:38:24.210
You owe it to me,

01:38:24.250 --> 01:38:26.730
'cause tomorrow I'm gonna
wake up and I'll be 50,

01:38:26.810 --> 01:38:29.170
and I'll still
be doin' this shit.

01:38:29.250 --> 01:38:31.690
That's all right.
That's fine.

01:38:31.770 --> 01:38:34.250
I mean, you're sittin' on
a winnin' lottery ticket.

01:38:34.330 --> 01:38:37.850
You're too much of a pussy
to cash it in, and that's bullshit.

01:38:39.810 --> 01:38:42.610
'Cause I'd do fuckin' anything
to have what you got.

01:38:42.650 --> 01:38:45.410
So would any of
these fuckin' guys.

01:38:45.490 --> 01:38:48.050
Be an insult to us
if you're still here in 20 years.

01:38:48.090 --> 01:38:50.570
Hangin' around here
is a fuckin' waste of your time.

01:38:50.650 --> 01:38:52.690
- You don't know that.
- I don't?

01:38:52.730 --> 01:38:56.090
- No. You don't know that.
- Oh, I don't know that. Let me tell you what I do know.

01:38:56.170 --> 01:38:59.890
Every day I come by your house,
and I pick you up.

01:38:59.930 --> 01:39:03.770
We go out and have a few drinks
and few laughs, and it's great.

01:39:03.850 --> 01:39:06.450
You know what the
best part of my day is?

01:39:06.490 --> 01:39:10.730
It's for about ten seconds: from when I pull
up to the curb and when I get to your door.

01:39:10.810 --> 01:39:15.290
'Cause I think maybe I'll get up there and
I'll knock on the door and you won't be there.

01:39:15.370 --> 01:39:18.690
No "good-bye," no "see ya later. "
No nothing. You just left.

01:39:18.770 --> 01:39:22.890
I don't know much,
but I know that.

01:39:34.730 --> 01:39:37.130
This is a disaster, Sean.

01:39:37.210 --> 01:39:39.490
I brought you in here because
I wanted you to help me with the boy,

01:39:39.530 --> 01:39:41.450
- not to run him out.
- I know what I'm doing with the boy.

01:39:41.530 --> 01:39:43.410
I don't care if you have
a rapport with the boy!

01:39:43.490 --> 01:39:46.010
I don't care if you have a few laughs,
even at my expense.

01:39:46.090 --> 01:39:48.730
- But don't you dare undermine what I'm trying to do here.
- Undermine?

01:39:48.810 --> 01:39:50.770
This boy is at
a fragile point right now.

01:39:50.850 --> 01:39:53.730
I do understand. He is at
a fragile point. He's got problems.

01:39:53.770 --> 01:39:57.210
What problems does he have? That he's
better off as a janitor, in jail?

01:39:57.290 --> 01:40:00.250
Better hanging out with
a bunch of retarded gorillas?

01:40:00.330 --> 01:40:04.130
Why do you think he does that?
You have any fuckin' clue why?

01:40:04.210 --> 01:40:07.610
He can handle the problems. He can
handle the work. He obviously handled you.

01:40:07.690 --> 01:40:10.130
Listen to me.
Why is he hiding?

01:40:10.210 --> 01:40:12.050
Why doesn't
he trust anybody?

01:40:12.130 --> 01:40:13.970
Because the first thing
that happened to him,

01:40:14.050 --> 01:40:15.890
he was abandoned by the people
who were supposed to love him the most.

01:40:15.970 --> 01:40:17.890
Don't give me
that Freudian crap.

01:40:17.970 --> 01:40:20.210
Why does he hang out with those
retarded gorillas, as you call them?

01:40:20.290 --> 01:40:23.730
Because any one of them, if he asked
them to, would take a bat to your head.

01:40:23.810 --> 01:40:26.610
- That's called loyalty.
- Yeah, that's very touching.

01:40:26.690 --> 01:40:29.730
Who's he handling? He pushes people away
before they have a chance to leave him.

01:40:29.770 --> 01:40:32.210
It's a defense mechanism,
all right?

01:40:32.290 --> 01:40:34.890
For 20 years, he's been
alone because of that.

01:40:34.970 --> 01:40:37.530
If you push him right now, it's gonna
be the same thing all over again.

01:40:37.610 --> 01:40:39.450
I'm not gonna
let that happen to him.

01:40:39.530 --> 01:40:41.370
- Don't you do that.
- What?

01:40:41.450 --> 01:40:45.090
Don't infect him with the idea that it's
okay to quit, that it's okay to be a failure.

01:40:45.130 --> 01:40:47.010
Because it's not okay, Sean!

01:40:47.050 --> 01:40:50.690
And if you're angry at me for being
successful, for being what you could have been-

01:40:50.770 --> 01:40:53.490
- I'm not angry at you.
- Oh, yes, you're angry at me.

01:40:53.570 --> 01:40:57.530
You resent me, but I'm not gonna
apologize for any success I've had.

01:40:57.610 --> 01:41:00.250
You're angry at me for doing
what you could have done!

01:41:00.330 --> 01:41:02.370
But ask yourself, Sean-
Ask yourself...

01:41:02.410 --> 01:41:05.690
if you want Will to feel that way-
if you want him to feel like a failure?

01:41:05.770 --> 01:41:07.690
You arrogant shit!

01:41:07.770 --> 01:41:12.090
That's why I don't come to the goddamn reunions,
'cause I can't stand that look in your eye.

01:41:12.170 --> 01:41:15.050
- That condescending, embarrassed look.
- Oh, come on, Sean.

01:41:15.130 --> 01:41:17.050
You think I'm a failure.
I know who I am.

01:41:17.130 --> 01:41:21.410
I'm proud of what I do. It was
a conscious choice. I didn't fuck up!

01:41:21.490 --> 01:41:24.130
And you and your cronies think
I'm some sort of pity case.

01:41:24.170 --> 01:41:27.650
You and your kiss-ass chorus following
you around going, "The Field's medal!"

01:41:27.730 --> 01:41:30.930
Why are you still so
fuckin' afraid of failure?

01:41:31.010 --> 01:41:34.930
It's about my medal, isn't it? Oh, God, I could
go home and get it for you. You can have it.

01:41:35.010 --> 01:41:37.850
Shove the medal up
your fuckin' ass, all right?

01:41:37.930 --> 01:41:39.850
'Cause I don't give
a shit about your medal,

01:41:39.930 --> 01:41:41.810
because I knew you before
you were a mathematical god,

01:41:41.890 --> 01:41:45.370
when you were pimple-faced and homesick and
didn't know what side of the bed to piss on.

01:41:45.450 --> 01:41:47.330
Yeah, you were smarter than me then
and you're smarter than me now.

01:41:47.410 --> 01:41:49.290
So don't blame me for
how your life turned out.

01:41:49.330 --> 01:41:51.650
I don't blame you!
It's not about you!

01:41:51.690 --> 01:41:54.370
You mathematical dick!
It's about the boy!

01:41:54.410 --> 01:41:59.210
He's a good kid! And I won't see you fuck him
up like you're tryin' to fuck up me right now.

01:41:59.290 --> 01:42:01.690
I won't see you make him
feel like a failure too!

01:42:01.770 --> 01:42:05.090
- He won't be a failure!
- But if you push him! If you ride him!

01:42:05.170 --> 01:42:10.610
I am what I am today because I was pushed
and because I learned to push myself.

01:42:10.690 --> 01:42:12.650
He's not you!
You get that!

01:42:14.690 --> 01:42:16.450
I can come back.

01:42:16.530 --> 01:42:20.450
No, come in.
Uh, I was just leaving.

01:42:30.250 --> 01:42:34.010
A lot of that stuff goes back
a long way between me and him.

01:42:34.090 --> 01:42:36.050
You know. Not about you.

01:42:39.050 --> 01:42:42.530
What is that?

01:42:42.570 --> 01:42:46.730
This is your file. I have to send it
back to the judge for evaluation.

01:42:46.810 --> 01:42:51.730
Oh. Hey, you're not
gonna fail me, are you?

01:42:55.250 --> 01:42:57.370
What's it say?

01:42:58.690 --> 01:43:01.250
- Wanna read it?
- Why?

01:43:02.890 --> 01:43:05.970
Have you had any, uh,
experience with that?

01:43:06.050 --> 01:43:09.490
Twenty years of counseling.
Yeah, I've seen some pretty awful shit.

01:43:09.570 --> 01:43:13.730
I mean, have you had
any experience with that?

01:43:17.570 --> 01:43:20.930
- Personally?
- Yeah.

01:43:21.010 --> 01:43:22.890
Yeah, I have.

01:43:22.930 --> 01:43:24.890
It sure ain't good.

01:43:28.170 --> 01:43:30.210
My father was an alcoholic.

01:43:30.250 --> 01:43:32.970
Mean fuckin' drunk.

01:43:34.530 --> 01:43:37.410
He'd come home hammered,
lookin' to whale on somebody.

01:43:37.450 --> 01:43:41.810
So I'd provoke him so he wouldn't go
after my mother and little brother.

01:43:41.890 --> 01:43:45.890
Interesting nights
when he wore his rings.

01:43:46.890 --> 01:43:50.210
He used to just
put a wrench,

01:43:50.290 --> 01:43:52.930
a stick and a belt
on the table.

01:43:53.010 --> 01:43:56.890
- Just say, "Choose. "
- Well, I gotta go with the belt there.

01:43:56.970 --> 01:43:58.850
I used to go with the wrench.

01:43:58.890 --> 01:44:00.810
Why the wrench?

01:44:00.890 --> 01:44:03.170
'Cause fuck him, that's why.

01:44:03.210 --> 01:44:06.690
- Your foster father?
- Yeah.

01:44:06.730 --> 01:44:10.490
So, uh, what is it, like,
Will has an attachment disorder?

01:44:10.570 --> 01:44:12.770
Is it all that stuff?

01:44:12.850 --> 01:44:15.650
Fear of abandonment?

01:44:15.690 --> 01:44:18.610
Is that why I broke up
with Skylar?

01:44:18.690 --> 01:44:21.890
- I didn't know you had.
- Yeah, I did.

01:44:21.930 --> 01:44:25.730
- You wanna talk about it?
- No.

01:44:27.850 --> 01:44:33.450
Hey, Will,
I don't know a lot.

01:44:33.530 --> 01:44:36.810
You see this?
All this shit?

01:44:41.610 --> 01:44:43.610
It's not your fault.

01:44:45.810 --> 01:44:47.890
Yeah, I know that.

01:44:47.970 --> 01:44:50.810
Look at me, son.

01:44:50.890 --> 01:44:54.250
- It's not your fault.
- I know.

01:44:54.330 --> 01:44:58.770
No. It's not
your fault.

01:44:58.850 --> 01:45:00.690
I know.

01:45:00.770 --> 01:45:05.090
No, no, you don't.
It's not your fault.

01:45:05.170 --> 01:45:07.050
- Hmm?
- I know.

01:45:07.130 --> 01:45:09.730
- It's not your fault.
- All right.

01:45:09.810 --> 01:45:12.170
It's not your fault.

01:45:13.970 --> 01:45:19.010
- It's not your fault.
- Don't fuck with me.

01:45:19.090 --> 01:45:21.370
It's not your fault.

01:45:21.450 --> 01:45:24.850
Don't fuck with me, all right?
Don't fuck with me, Sean, not you.

01:45:24.930 --> 01:45:27.370
It's not your fault.

01:45:32.370 --> 01:45:36.290
It's not your fault.

01:45:42.250 --> 01:45:45.250
My God-

01:45:45.290 --> 01:45:49.730
My God! I'm so sorry!
My God!

01:46:03.370 --> 01:46:05.410
Fuck them, okay?

01:47:27.970 --> 01:47:31.890
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I'm Will Hunting. I'm here about a position.

01:47:31.970 --> 01:47:34.290
Could you just have
a seat for a moment?

01:47:37.730 --> 01:47:40.970
Yes, there's
a Mr. Hunting in the lobby.

01:48:00.170 --> 01:48:02.170
Which one did you take?

01:48:02.250 --> 01:48:06.970
I was over at McNeil. It's one of
the jobs the professor set me up with.

01:48:07.050 --> 01:48:11.250
I haven't told him yet, but I went
down there and talked to my boss-

01:48:11.290 --> 01:48:14.610
My new boss.
He seemed like a good guy.

01:48:14.650 --> 01:48:19.850
- Is that what you want?
- Yeah, you know, I think so.

01:48:19.930 --> 01:48:22.810
Well, good for you.
Congratulations.

01:48:22.890 --> 01:48:24.730
Thanks.

01:48:27.690 --> 01:48:29.530
Time's up.

01:48:32.370 --> 01:48:35.490
So that's- So that's it?
So we're done?

01:48:35.570 --> 01:48:38.250
Yeah, that's it.

01:48:38.330 --> 01:48:41.050
You're done.
You're a free man.

01:48:42.290 --> 01:48:46.810
Well, um, I just want you
to know, Sean, that-

01:48:46.890 --> 01:48:48.810
You're welcome, Will.

01:48:53.730 --> 01:48:56.650
So, you know, I hope
we keep in touch, you know.

01:48:56.730 --> 01:48:59.090
Yeah, me too.

01:48:59.170 --> 01:49:01.690
I'll be travelin' around a bit.
It'll be a little hard, but, uh-

01:49:01.770 --> 01:49:05.330
I've got an answering machine at
the college I'll be checking in with.

01:49:05.370 --> 01:49:09.050
So, here's the number.

01:49:09.130 --> 01:49:12.850
You call that.
I'll get back to you right away.

01:49:12.890 --> 01:49:15.890
Yeah, you know,
I figured I'm just gonna...

01:49:15.930 --> 01:49:20.330
put my money back on the table
and see what kind of cards I get.

01:49:21.530 --> 01:49:24.410
You do what's in your heart,
son. You'll be fine.

01:49:28.730 --> 01:49:30.810
- Thank you, Sean.
- Uh-

01:49:30.890 --> 01:49:32.850
Thank you, Will.

01:49:34.490 --> 01:49:37.650
Hey, does this violate
the patient-doctor relationship?

01:49:37.730 --> 01:49:39.810
Naw. Only if you
grab my ass.

01:49:43.450 --> 01:49:45.530
- Take care.
- You too.

01:49:45.610 --> 01:49:47.450
Yeah.

01:49:49.210 --> 01:49:51.130
Hey.

01:49:51.210 --> 01:49:53.490
Good luck, son.

01:50:04.130 --> 01:50:06.810
Two beers.

01:50:09.410 --> 01:50:11.370
What's up?
Did you guys go?

01:50:11.450 --> 01:50:13.690
No. I had to talk him down.

01:50:13.770 --> 01:50:17.330
- Why didn't you yoke him?
- Little Morgan's got a lot of scrap to him.

01:50:17.370 --> 01:50:19.250
People try to whip
his ass every week.

01:50:19.290 --> 01:50:21.690
- Fuckin' kid won't back down.
- What are you sayin' about me?

01:50:21.730 --> 01:50:25.090
- Was I talkin' to you?
None of your fuckin' business.

01:50:25.170 --> 01:50:28.290
- Go get me a beer.
- I ordered two beers!

01:50:28.370 --> 01:50:30.290
- Hey, asshole.
- What, bitch?

01:50:30.330 --> 01:50:34.010
- Happy birthday.
- Thought we forgot, huh, bitch?

01:50:34.090 --> 01:50:36.570
- Come on!
- I'm goin'. I'm goin'.

01:50:36.650 --> 01:50:38.490
All right. Who's first?

01:50:38.570 --> 01:50:40.890
- Come on, motherfucker!
- Who's first?

01:50:40.970 --> 01:50:42.810
% Oh, Danny boy %%

01:50:42.890 --> 01:50:46.290
Here's your present.

01:50:46.330 --> 01:50:48.250
- Come on, bro.
- What?

01:50:48.330 --> 01:50:52.410
Well, we knew you had to get back and
forth to Cambridge for your new job.

01:50:52.490 --> 01:50:56.210
I knew I wasn't gonna fuckin'
drive you every day, so-

01:50:56.250 --> 01:51:00.170
- Morgan wanted to get you a "T" pass.
- That's not what I was sayin'!

01:51:00.250 --> 01:51:02.610
But, uh, you're 21 now.

01:51:02.690 --> 01:51:06.130
You're legally allowed to drink, so we
figured the best thing for ya was a car.

01:51:06.170 --> 01:51:08.570
- How do you like it?
- This is like-

01:51:10.930 --> 01:51:14.690
It's the ugliest fuckin' car
I've ever seen in my life.

01:51:14.770 --> 01:51:16.690
- Come on, brother.
- How'd you guys do this?

01:51:16.770 --> 01:51:21.530
You know, me and Bill
scraped together the parts,

01:51:21.570 --> 01:51:23.570
and Morgan was out panhandlin'
for change every day.

01:51:23.610 --> 01:51:25.490
I had the router to do
all the bodywork.

01:51:25.530 --> 01:51:27.410
Yeah, I have a fuckin' job,
too, brother.

01:51:27.450 --> 01:51:29.810
Guy's been up my ass for two years about
a job. I had to let him help with the car.

01:51:29.850 --> 01:51:31.850
So you finally got a job,
huh, Morgan?

01:51:31.930 --> 01:51:34.050
- Yeah, had one. Now I'm fucked again.
- So what is it?

01:51:34.130 --> 01:51:37.650
- A lawn mower? What do ya got?
- It's a straight fuckin' six.

01:51:37.690 --> 01:51:39.570
Me and Bill rebuilt
this engine ourselves here.

01:51:39.610 --> 01:51:42.570
It's a good car.
The engine's good. Engine's good.

01:51:42.650 --> 01:51:45.890
- Happy 21, Will.
- Happy 21, brother.

01:51:52.690 --> 01:51:54.530
Hi.

01:51:55.930 --> 01:51:57.890
Come on in.

01:51:59.930 --> 01:52:01.810
Sean, I, um-

01:52:01.850 --> 01:52:04.770
Me too, Gerry.

01:52:04.850 --> 01:52:07.090
Yeah. Good.

01:52:08.130 --> 01:52:10.170
I heard you're
takin' some time.

01:52:10.250 --> 01:52:14.650
Yeah. Travel a little bit,
maybe write.

01:52:14.730 --> 01:52:16.610
So where are you going?

01:52:16.690 --> 01:52:20.530
India and China
and Baltimore.

01:52:21.730 --> 01:52:23.730
Oh.

01:52:23.770 --> 01:52:25.690
You know when
you'll be back?

01:52:25.770 --> 01:52:29.050
Oh. I got this flyer
the other day.

01:52:29.090 --> 01:52:31.810
It says, uh, class of '72
is having a reunion in six months.

01:52:31.890 --> 01:52:33.730
Yeah, I got
one of those too.

01:52:33.810 --> 01:52:35.650
Why don't you come?
I'll buy ya a drink.

01:52:35.730 --> 01:52:38.490
The drinks at
those things are free.

01:52:38.530 --> 01:52:41.890
I know, Gerry.
I was being ironical.

01:52:46.090 --> 01:52:49.730
- Oh.
- How about a drink right now?

01:52:49.810 --> 01:52:52.850
Yeah. It's a good idea.

01:52:52.890 --> 01:52:55.170
Come on.
This one's on me.

01:52:57.850 --> 01:53:00.090
- I got the winner right here, pal.
- Oh!

01:53:00.170 --> 01:53:03.370
Yes, sir, this is the one.

01:53:03.450 --> 01:53:05.650
This is my ticket
to paradise.

01:53:05.730 --> 01:53:07.730
Do you know what the odds
are against winning the lottery?

01:53:07.770 --> 01:53:10.690
- What? Four to one?
- About 30 million to one.

01:53:10.770 --> 01:53:12.810
I still have a shot, you know?

01:53:12.890 --> 01:53:18.490
Yes, just about as big chance as you being hit
by lightning here on the staircase right now.

01:53:18.570 --> 01:53:21.690
It's a possibility too. I mean,
32 million. If you look at the size-

01:54:47.490 --> 01:54:49.810
Will!

01:55:08.050 --> 01:55:09.890
Will?

01:56:14.370 --> 01:56:16.250
He's not there.

01:56:32.570 --> 01:56:36.410
% I'll fake it
through the day %

01:56:36.450 --> 01:56:39.610
Sean, if
the professor calls about that job,

01:56:39.650 --> 01:56:44.050
just tell him sorry,
I had to go see about a girl.

01:56:44.130 --> 01:56:45.970
Will.

01:56:47.490 --> 01:56:50.690
Son of a bitch.
He stole my line.

01:56:53.810 --> 01:57:00.170
% To take its toll
and in having a lot %

01:57:00.250 --> 01:57:03.930
% Of nothin' to do %

01:57:03.970 --> 01:57:07.170
% Do you miss me %

01:57:07.250 --> 01:57:10.770
% Miss misery %

01:57:10.810 --> 01:57:14.410
% Like you say you do %

01:57:16.250 --> 01:57:20.330
% I know you'd rather
see me gone %

01:57:20.410 --> 01:57:23.290
% Than to see me %

01:57:23.370 --> 01:57:25.650
% The way %

01:57:25.690 --> 01:57:28.650
% That I am, when I am %

01:57:28.730 --> 01:57:32.050
% In the life anyway %

01:57:32.130 --> 01:57:38.890
% Next door TV's
flashing through %

01:57:38.970 --> 01:57:42.450
% Frames on the wall %

01:57:42.490 --> 01:57:45.410
% It's a comedy %

01:57:45.490 --> 01:57:47.930
% Of errors, you see %

01:57:48.010 --> 01:57:52.770
% It's about
takin' a fall %

01:57:54.810 --> 01:57:57.810
% To vanish into %

01:57:57.850 --> 01:58:00.890
% Oblivion %

01:58:00.970 --> 01:58:04.570
% It's easy to do %

01:58:04.650 --> 01:58:07.370
% And I try to be %

01:58:07.450 --> 01:58:11.410
% But you know me
I come back %

01:58:11.450 --> 01:58:15.570
% When you want me to %

01:58:15.650 --> 01:58:18.970
% Do you miss me %

01:58:19.050 --> 01:58:22.570
% Miss misery %

01:58:22.650 --> 01:58:27.690
% Like you say you do %%

01:58:40.690 --> 01:58:43.730
% Gonna find my baby
Gonna hold her tight %

01:58:43.810 --> 01:58:47.290
% Gonna grab
some afternoon delight %

01:58:47.370 --> 01:58:50.170
% My motto's always been
When it's right, it's right %

01:58:50.250 --> 01:58:53.650
% Why wait until the middle
of a cold, dark night %

01:58:53.730 --> 01:58:59.970
% When everything's a little
clearer in the light of day %

01:59:00.050 --> 01:59:06.170
% And we know the night is
always gonna be here anyway %

01:59:06.250 --> 01:59:08.890
% Thinkin' of you
is workin' up an appetite %

01:59:08.970 --> 01:59:11.930
% Lookin' forward to
a little afternoon delight %

01:59:12.010 --> 01:59:15.090
% Rubbin' sticks and stones
together make the sparks ignite %

01:59:15.170 --> 01:59:18.530
% And the thought of rubbin' you
is gettin' so excitin' %

01:59:18.610 --> 01:59:21.610
% Skyrockets in flight %

01:59:21.690 --> 01:59:24.490
% Afternoon delight %

01:59:26.490 --> 01:59:30.290

01:59:38.770 --> 01:59:41.530
% Started out this mornin'
feelin' so polite %

01:59:41.570 --> 01:59:45.330
% I always thought a fish
could not be caught who didn't bite %

01:59:45.370 --> 01:59:48.250
% But you got some bait a-waitin'
and I think I might %

01:59:48.330 --> 01:59:51.650
% Like nibblin' a little
afternoon delight %

01:59:51.730 --> 01:59:54.770

% Be waitin' for me, baby
when I come around %

02:00:21.850 --> 02:00:28.010
% We can make a lot of lovin'
before the sun go down %

02:00:28.090 --> 02:00:30.810
