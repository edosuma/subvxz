00:39.330 --> 00:40.957
Yes, this is Principal
Seymour Skinner.

00:41.041 --> 00:42.417
How can I help you,
Principal?

00:42.500 --> 00:43.668
I'm afraid there's

00:43.752 --> 00:45.295
some problems with my tickets.

00:45.378 --> 00:47.756
I asked for a center seat,
not an aisle seat.

00:47.839 --> 00:50.091
I specifically requested not
to have the kosher meal.

00:50.175 --> 00:52.886
And I booked the flight leaving
Saturday morning, not Friday morning.

00:52.969 --> 00:55.638
Okay, I've gone ahead
and made those changes,

00:55.722 --> 00:57.474
and with the one-day
advance purchase price,

00:57.557 --> 01:00.518
it's just an extra $7,830.

G.M. Chrysler!
I can't afford that.

01:03.396 --> 01:06.107
(sighs) But I can't close
the school a day early

01:06.191 --> 01:08.818
just to suit my vacation.

01:08.902 --> 01:10.153

why you get to stay home
and watch Mom work.

01:27.670 --> 01:29.422
Because I've always
been an advocate

01:29.506 --> 01:31.257
of women in the workplace,
Lis.

01:31.341 --> 01:34.260
I can't help it if Mom's
workplace contains our TV.

01:34.344 --> 01:36.679
I'm honored, Bart.

01:36.763 --> 01:38.890
And Lisa, you'll have a fine
time at the plant with Dad.

01:38.973 --> 01:41.518
You've been interested
in nuclear power for years.

01:41.601 --> 01:44.187
I've signed numerous petitions
to shut down that plant.

01:44.270 --> 01:47.148
-Well, there you go.
-Mom, you're blocking the TV.

01:59.119 --> 02:00.912
Bart can take my place
at the plant.

02:00.995 --> 02:03.623
But he so wanted to see
women in the workplace.

02:08.962 --> 02:11.422
I would never ever
have thought of that.

02:11.506 --> 02:12.966

02:14.801 --> 02:18.221
Some days, we don't let

02:38.366 --> 02:42.120
-Wow!
-Crackers ho!

could be so exciting.

those crackers

02:47.125 --> 02:48.877

Why are there so many
burnt-out ones?

03:16.196 --> 03:18.364

decent to do with this I.D.

05:38.463 --> 05:40.381

Well, we're having the best
spring break of our lives,

around nerding it up.

05:57.565 --> 05:59.650

in your vacation fun.

06:02.403 --> 06:04.030
Yeah, right.

to get some kicks

of preparing an air-tight

07:12.807 --> 07:15.184
How come I never heard
about this competition?

07:15.268 --> 07:17.687

07:17.770 --> 07:19.730
a dorkus malorkus.

07:19.814 --> 07:21.607

Hi, Lisa.
How is your spring break going?

08:49.570 --> 08:51.405
I'm learning about owls.

08:51.489 --> 08:54.492
Oh, owls, eh?
So you probably wouldn't want

08:54.575 --> 08:56.327
to spend another day
at work with me...

08:56.410 --> 08:57.912
Sure, I would.

08:57.995 --> 08:59.956
I can learn about owls
this summer at bird camp.

How much farther
to the grammar rodeo?

09:12.593 --> 09:14.136
Grammar rodeo!

09:14.220 --> 09:16.806
We're going to
a grammar rodeo?

09:16.889 --> 09:18.724
We're not going
to a grammar rodeo.

09:18.808 --> 09:20.935
That was just

09:24.438 --> 09:25.773
Where are we going?

09:27.858 --> 09:30.653
Well, I realize it's trite,
but we could tour

09:30.736 --> 09:32.613
the bridges of Madison County.

09:32.697 --> 09:35.575
Hey, who has better
vacation ideas than Triple-A?

09:35.658 --> 09:37.410
According to the publisher

09:37.493 --> 09:39.537
of this triple-a guidebook--
no one.

09:39.620 --> 09:42.123
I've always wanted
to see Macon, Georgia.

09:42.206 --> 09:44.166
Wait, how about a fair?

09:44.250 --> 09:45.793
Not just a county fair.

09:45.876 --> 09:47.920
Not just a Europe fair,

09:48.004 --> 09:49.589
but a world's fair.

09:49.672 --> 09:52.675
The world's fair
in Knoxville, Tennessee.

09:52.758 --> 09:54.051
Keep reading.

09:54.135 --> 09:55.469
The Hungarians have built

09:55.553 --> 09:57.597
a giant, motorized Rubik's cube,

09:57.680 --> 10:00.099
and the fair's symbol
is the Sunsphere

10:00.182 --> 10:03.853

steel shaft.

-An information desk.

10:06.689 --> 10:08.441

Disney World and Knoxville.

10:15.114 --> 10:16.365

getting past
the security guards?

10:25.374 --> 10:27.126
Security guards?

10:27.209 --> 10:28.753
-Great! You want to get some lunch?
-Sure.

10:28.836 --> 10:30.588
The way I figure it,

10:30.671 --> 10:32.131
if candy stays
in the machine

10:32.214 --> 10:34.467
for more than a year,
it's up for grabs.

10:34.550 --> 10:35.718
(groaning)

10:35.801 --> 10:37.303
Why do you need me?

10:37.386 --> 10:38.929
Well, it's a two-man operation,

10:39.013 --> 10:40.723
and you're the only
man here I trust. Ready?

10:40.806 --> 10:41.807
Ready.

10:43.726 --> 10:45.102
-Whoo-hoo!
-Whoo-hoo!

10:45.186 --> 10:47.104
Simpson! What in God's
name are you--

10:47.188 --> 10:48.689
Zagnut bar, Mr. Smithers?

10:48.773 --> 10:50.733
Razzles? Skittles?
Whatchamacallit? Twizzlers?

10:50.816 --> 10:53.611
They all have hilarious names
and are delicious.

10:53.694 --> 10:57.657
Well, I am partial
to Jolly Ranchers. Mmm.

10:57.740 --> 10:59.659
Good work, Simpson.

10:59.742 --> 11:02.286
Simpsons.

11:02.370 --> 11:05.164
Boy, Lisa, with you here,
this hardly seems like work at all.

11:05.247 --> 11:06.666
I don't know how I'm
going to make it

11:06.749 --> 11:08.584
through my night shift
without you.

11:08.668 --> 11:11.462
-We can have a slumber party.
-Oh, that'd be great.

11:11.545 --> 11:14.924
Sleeping bags on the floor,
a roaring fire--

11:15.007 --> 11:18.010
It'll be like the time they kicked me out
of the sporting goods store.

11:18.094 --> 11:20.179
(kids yelling, laughing)

11:20.262 --> 11:23.516
If you kids can't keep
your hands to yourself,

11:23.599 --> 11:25.643
I'm going to turn
this car around,

11:25.726 --> 11:28.354
and there'll be no
Cape Canaveral for anybody!

11:29.897 --> 11:31.649
That's it!
Back to Winnipeg!

11:34.527 --> 11:36.696
Bart, can we stop
for ice cream?

11:36.779 --> 11:38.114
Yes.

11:38.197 --> 11:40.491
Bart, can we weigh the car

11:40.574 --> 11:42.326
at that weigh station?

11:42.410 --> 11:44.286
Yeah.

11:44.370 --> 11:46.372
Bart, can we pick up
that hitchhiker?

11:46.455 --> 11:48.082
I don't see why not.

11:48.165 --> 11:50.292
Bart, can we stop
for ice cream?

11:50.376 --> 11:52.586
Yes.

11:52.670 --> 11:54.296
Well, I didn't think
I was rehabilitated,

11:54.380 --> 11:56.966
but I guess they needed
the extra bed.

11:58.843 --> 12:00.553
(sighs)

12:00.636 --> 12:02.555
With Bart gone,
and now you and your father,

12:02.638 --> 12:04.014
I'm not going to have
anyone to--

12:04.098 --> 12:06.142
Thanks, Mom. Bye.

12:06.225 --> 12:07.435
...talk to.

12:12.148 --> 12:15.192
-What is this place?
-Branson, Missouri.

12:15.276 --> 12:16.861
My dad says it's like Vegas

12:16.944 --> 12:18.612
if it were run by Ned Flanders.

12:20.906 --> 12:23.159
Andy Williams!

12:23.242 --> 12:24.618
Oh, we don't need
to stop here.

12:24.702 --> 12:27.455
-Yes, we do!
-Ugh!

12:29.290 --> 12:32.418
ANDY WILLIAMS:
<i>♪ ...my huckleberry friend ♪</i>

12:32.501 --> 12:37.214
<i>♪ Moon river ♪</i>

12:37.298 --> 12:40.760
<i>♪ And me ♪</i>

12:40.843 --> 12:43.763
(cheers, applause)

12:43.846 --> 12:46.432
(whistles)
Wow!

12:46.515 --> 12:49.435
I didn't think he was
going to do "Moon River,"

12:49.518 --> 12:51.771
but then, bam,
second encore.

12:51.854 --> 12:53.773
Okay, time
for truth or dare.

12:53.856 --> 12:55.691
-You go first.
-Eh... truth.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.193
Ask me anything.

12:57.276 --> 13:01.614
Who do you love most--
me, Bart, or Maggie?

13:01.697 --> 13:03.449
D'oh! All right, dare.

13:03.532 --> 13:06.827
Okay, why don't you...

13:06.911 --> 13:08.454
Hello, I'd like to speak

13:08.537 --> 13:10.581
with a Mr. Snotball.

13:10.664 --> 13:12.082
First name Ura.

13:12.166 --> 13:13.250
Ura Snotball?

13:13.334 --> 13:15.085
What? How dare you!

13:15.169 --> 13:18.380
If I find out who this is,
I'll staple a flag to your butt

13:18.464 --> 13:21.258
and mail you to Iran!

13:21.342 --> 13:23.969
-Okay, your turn.
-Mmm... truth.

13:24.053 --> 13:27.556
Uh... do you have
a crush on anyone?

13:27.640 --> 13:28.682
Dad.

13:28.766 --> 13:30.851
I won't tell anybody.

13:30.935 --> 13:32.478
Dad, you tell everybody
everything.

13:32.561 --> 13:35.105
Even Moe knew when I
threw up on the dentist.

13:35.189 --> 13:37.691
Moe thinks he knows
a lot more than Moe knows.

13:37.775 --> 13:39.944
Well, just give me
another chance,

13:40.027 --> 13:42.112
and I'll prove
I can keep your secret.

13:42.196 --> 13:43.489
Okay.

13:43.572 --> 13:45.407
I like...

13:45.491 --> 13:47.409
Langdon Alger.

13:47.493 --> 13:50.621
I have no idea who that is.

13:50.704 --> 13:51.789
Nobody does.

13:51.872 --> 13:53.207
(giggling)

13:53.290 --> 13:55.084
He's very quiet
and enjoys puzzles,

13:55.167 --> 13:56.919
but that still doesn't mean
you can tell anyone.

13:57.002 --> 14:00.506
I've already forgotten his name.

14:00.589 --> 14:01.799
It was Larsen something, right?

14:01.882 --> 14:03.425
(giggling)

14:03.509 --> 14:05.177
Thanks, Dad.

14:05.261 --> 14:08.055
Oh, this has been
the best spring break ever.

14:08.138 --> 14:10.516
And with my patented seminar,
you will learn

14:10.599 --> 14:13.310
how to corner the real estate
market through hypnosis.

14:13.394 --> 14:15.145
Why waste your hypnotic powers

14:15.229 --> 14:16.856
on neighbors and co-workers
when...

14:16.939 --> 14:18.566
I can't take this anymore.

14:19.692 --> 14:21.235
(sighs)

14:22.570 --> 14:24.196
(sighs)

14:28.117 --> 14:29.326
(coughing)

14:29.410 --> 14:31.787
(coughing louder)

14:33.539 --> 14:34.957
(groaning)

14:35.040 --> 14:36.834
(crying)

14:36.917 --> 14:38.878
Aw, there, there...

14:38.961 --> 14:41.005
oh, Maggie, there...

14:48.178 --> 14:49.805
We're on the home stretch.

14:49.889 --> 14:51.682
Next stop--
the Knoxville World's Fair

14:51.765 --> 14:54.059
and its fabulous Sunsphere.

14:59.940 --> 15:01.984
Hurry up.
We've only got four days

15:02.067 --> 15:03.444
to spend at the...

15:03.527 --> 15:06.030
"Wod... fir"?

15:06.113 --> 15:07.531
(metallic clatter)

15:10.910 --> 15:12.328
Uh... excuse me.

15:12.411 --> 15:14.371
Is this the World's Fair
visitor's center?

15:14.455 --> 15:17.917
It used to be,
back in 1982.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.961
You're 14 years too late.

15:21.045 --> 15:26.175
But there's another world's fair
coming soon, right?

15:26.258 --> 15:28.177
Before Friday?

15:28.260 --> 15:29.428
What about the Sunsphere?

15:29.511 --> 15:30.971
You mean the Wigsphere.

15:31.055 --> 15:33.307
You're welcome to go up there

15:33.390 --> 15:36.769
if you want to see
16,000 boxes of unsold wigs.

15:36.852 --> 15:40.606
Now, you gentlemen gonna buy
some wigs or ain't ya?

15:40.689 --> 15:43.108
I guess fate was against us.

15:43.192 --> 15:46.362
It's really nobody's fault,
right?

15:46.445 --> 15:48.572
Uh, right?

15:48.656 --> 15:50.324
Well, we've still got a car

15:50.407 --> 15:51.784
and a wad of cash.

15:51.867 --> 15:53.744
Uh, no, we don't.

15:53.827 --> 15:55.996
I must have spent our last $10

15:56.080 --> 15:57.831
on this Al Gore doll.

15:57.915 --> 16:00.417
<i>You are hearing me talk.</i>

16:00.501 --> 16:03.337
I hate this place!

16:07.549 --> 16:08.968
We've got no car.

16:09.051 --> 16:10.469
We've got no money.

16:10.552 --> 16:12.262
And no one knows we're here.

16:12.346 --> 16:14.306
TOGETHER:
We're stranded!

16:14.390 --> 16:16.850
-(crying)
-But on the plus side,

16:16.934 --> 16:18.602
I knocked over the Sunsphere.

16:21.313 --> 16:22.773
NELSON:
Ha-ha!

16:27.569 --> 16:28.904
This never would have happened

16:28.988 --> 16:30.406
if we'd gone to Macon, Georgia.

16:31.699 --> 16:34.284
I'm just saying, is all.

16:34.368 --> 16:36.370
Fellows, I think perhaps
the time has come

16:36.453 --> 16:37.997
to call our parents.

16:38.080 --> 16:39.206
No! They'd kill us.

16:39.289 --> 16:40.791
Look, we got here on our own,

16:40.874 --> 16:42.459
so we can survive here
on our own.

16:42.543 --> 16:44.003
All we need is money, food,
and a way to get home.

16:44.086 --> 16:45.921
Follow me.

16:46.005 --> 16:49.258
Everybody, remember, we're
parked under the Sunsphere.

16:53.679 --> 16:56.598
Hey! I need those to see!

16:56.682 --> 16:58.392
Ah, these lenses are perfect.

16:58.475 --> 17:01.270
Now I can re-bottom
those antique coke bottles.

17:01.353 --> 17:04.023
-300...
-Hey, come back!

17:04.106 --> 17:07.651
400, 500, 600...

17:07.735 --> 17:09.111
Ow! Oh!

17:09.194 --> 17:11.530
500, 400, 300,
200, 100, zero.

17:13.323 --> 17:14.742
Come on!

17:14.825 --> 17:17.077
This train goes
right through Springfield.

17:20.956 --> 17:23.625
(all groaning)

17:28.172 --> 17:29.757
(phone ringing)

17:29.840 --> 17:32.718
Well, of course, I'll accept.

17:32.801 --> 17:35.929
Bart! I've missed you so mu--

17:36.013 --> 17:38.223
You want to speak to Lisa?

17:38.307 --> 17:40.684
So, how's the National
Grammar Rodeo, Bart?

17:40.768 --> 17:42.936
Lisa, I really need your help,

17:43.020 --> 17:44.855
so I 'm gonna let you in on a secret.
There's no such thing.

17:44.938 --> 17:47.024
I knew it! I knew it!
Because why would they have

17:47.107 --> 17:49.151
our national grammar rodeo
in another nation?

17:49.234 --> 17:51.028
Oh, Bart, you're going
to be in so much trouble.

17:51.111 --> 17:53.030
I'm in trouble already.
Here's what happened.

17:58.994 --> 18:01.497
So you've got to think of a way
I can come home for free.

18:01.580 --> 18:05.501
Hmm... you could travel for free
if you were a stewardess.

18:05.584 --> 18:08.337
Well, how badly
do you want to get home?

18:08.420 --> 18:09.797
All right, all right,
how about a courier?

18:09.880 --> 18:12.341
They travel for free too.

18:12.424 --> 18:14.426
No, that's a terrier.
They're dogs.

18:16.678 --> 18:19.098
Well, you sure don't look 25

18:19.181 --> 18:21.350
but your un-laminated
out-of-state driver's license

18:21.433 --> 18:22.893
is proof enough for me.

18:22.976 --> 18:25.270
Here's your first assignment.

18:32.069 --> 18:33.987
(speaking Chinese)

18:34.071 --> 18:35.948
(speaking Chinese)

18:36.031 --> 18:38.033
What the--

18:40.327 --> 18:42.162
(snoring)

18:42.246 --> 18:44.915
Can we call our parents yet,
Bart?

18:44.998 --> 18:47.000
(phone ringing)

18:47.084 --> 18:49.211
BART (on phone):
<i>Lisa, this isn't working.</i>

18:49.294 --> 18:50.379
I've got to courier something
to Springfield.

18:50.462 --> 18:51.797
And it's got to be big enough

18:51.880 --> 18:53.215
to fit Milhouse, Martin,
and Nelson inside.

18:53.298 --> 18:55.801
Bart, that will cost a fortune.

18:55.884 --> 18:58.011
Simpson, how'd you like
to escort 500 Big Macs

18:58.095 --> 18:59.930
to Marlon Brando's island?

19:00.013 --> 19:02.141
Oh, I can't take
much more of this.

19:02.224 --> 19:03.684
I'm counting on you, Lis.

19:10.065 --> 19:12.776
-(dejectedly) Whee.
-What's wrong, honey?

19:12.860 --> 19:14.611
There's something
troubling me, Dad.

19:14.695 --> 19:16.864
But I don't think I can tell you
because it's a secret.

19:16.947 --> 19:18.615
Well, you don't have to tell me,

19:18.699 --> 19:21.118
but I thought we trusted
each other with our secrets now.

19:21.201 --> 19:24.288
I mean, I haven't told a soul
about your new boyfriend.

19:24.371 --> 19:25.622
Langdon Alger?

19:25.706 --> 19:27.332
I don't like him anymore.

19:27.416 --> 19:29.293
Okay, but you gotta promise
you won't get mad

19:29.376 --> 19:31.378
or tell anyone,
especially Bart.

19:31.461 --> 19:32.713
I promise.

19:32.796 --> 19:34.381
Bart rented a car
with a phony driver's license

19:34.464 --> 19:36.508
and drove Milhouse, Nelson,
and Martin to a wig outlet in Knoxville

19:36.592 --> 19:38.510
and the car got crushed,
and they're out of money

19:38.594 --> 19:39.928
and they can't get home,
and Bart 's working as a courier

19:40.012 --> 19:40.929
and just came back
from Hong Kong.

19:42.347 --> 19:45.684
Yes, that's a real pickle.

19:45.767 --> 19:47.853
Would you excuse me
for a moment?

19:50.772 --> 19:53.650
(muffled yelling)

19:53.734 --> 19:57.112
(muffled yelling)

19:59.156 --> 20:01.200
All right, I have thought
this through.

20:01.283 --> 20:04.286
I will send Bart
the money to fly home,

20:04.369 --> 20:06.371
then I will murder him.

20:06.455 --> 20:08.832
No, no! Then he'll know I told!

20:08.916 --> 20:11.418
Dad, you said I could trust you.

20:11.501 --> 20:12.920
(sighs)

20:13.003 --> 20:15.505
Okay, we'll work this out
together.

20:15.589 --> 20:18.050
First things first.
Where is Knoxville?

20:18.133 --> 20:21.595
It's in Tennessee, right next to
the Oak Ridge nuclear facility,

20:21.678 --> 20:23.722
birthplace of
the atomic bomb.

20:23.805 --> 20:26.433
Well, maybe we could
order something from Oak Ridge.

20:26.516 --> 20:28.435
And Bart could
be the courier!

20:30.520 --> 20:31.730
Yello, Oak Ridge?

20:31.813 --> 20:33.899
This is Springfield Nuclear.

20:33.982 --> 20:36.068
We need to order a, uh...

20:37.945 --> 20:40.239
T-437

20:40.322 --> 20:41.740
safety command console.

20:41.823 --> 20:43.408
Springfield, my computer

20:43.492 --> 20:46.119
shows your t-437
is fully operational.

20:46.203 --> 20:48.038
Uh, I suggest you--

20:48.121 --> 20:49.456
Oh, my God!

20:49.539 --> 20:50.916
Oh, God, no!

20:50.999 --> 20:52.751
This can't be happening!

20:52.834 --> 20:55.462
This... you're operating
without a T-437, Springfield!

20:55.545 --> 20:57.297
Ah, sweet mother of mercy!

20:57.381 --> 20:59.299
I mean... I mean, my God!

20:59.383 --> 21:02.469
And have it sent to the Springfield
nuclear power plant

21:02.552 --> 21:04.471
care of Homer J.

21:04.554 --> 21:06.723
No, don't use your real name
or Bart will know!

21:06.807 --> 21:08.475
Forget the name
Homer Simpson.

21:08.558 --> 21:12.312
Have it sent care of
Langdon Alger.

21:14.898 --> 21:19.945
MILHOUSE (muffled voice): Bart! Hey,
we really could use another air hole.

21:20.028 --> 21:22.072
Shh! They'll know
you're in there.

21:22.155 --> 21:23.865
(chuckling)

21:26.159 --> 21:28.203
But I don't think
I'd go back again next year.

21:28.287 --> 21:30.122
It's getting too commercial.

21:30.205 --> 21:32.457
They've forgotten it's supposed
to be about the grammar.

21:39.214 --> 21:40.882
(phone ringing)

21:40.966 --> 21:42.384
Hello.

21:42.467 --> 21:44.886
Oh, hello,
Principal Skinner.

21:44.970 --> 21:48.223
No, Bart has never
been to Hong Kong.

21:48.307 --> 21:49.725
Good night.

21:50.851 --> 21:51.893
(phone ringing)

21:51.977 --> 21:53.520
Hello.

21:53.603 --> 21:55.981
Tennessee state police?

21:56.064 --> 21:59.067
No, my son's car was not
crushed in Knoxville.

21:59.151 --> 22:00.402
I don't know where
to begin telling you

22:00.485 --> 22:01.778
what's wrong with that.

22:01.862 --> 22:03.405
(phone ringing)

22:03.488 --> 22:04.906
Hello.

22:04.990 --> 22:07.534
No, Bart is not
available tomorrow

22:07.617 --> 22:10.996
to deliver a human kidney
to Amsterdam.

22:11.079 --> 22:12.539
(snickering)

22:12.622 --> 22:15.459
Homer, are you
laughing at me?
