if we find them?

15:28.583 --> 15:31.166
Well, let's verify their story
first, and then go from there.

15:32.917 --> 15:34.000
Dismissed.

15:38.625 --> 15:40.041
(door whooshes shut)

15:45.583 --> 15:47.125
It doesn't make sense.

15:47.208 --> 15:49.542
That ship was built
for research, not espionage.

15:49.625 --> 15:51.208
How can there be no trace?

15:52.542 --> 15:56.000
Isaac, do you have any way to
scan for masked ion signatures?

15:56.083 --> 15:57.583
I believe so.

15:57.667 --> 15:59.375
Okay, this one time
at Union Point,

15:59.458 --> 16:01.000
my roommate and I took
a shuttle out,

16:01.083 --> 16:03.000
and we turned it into,
like, a party bus,

16:03.083 --> 16:06.583
and we used a tractor beam
to neutralize our ion trail.

16:06.667 --> 16:07.959
They didn't catch you?

16:08.041 --> 16:09.458
Well, we plowed into a tree

16:09.542 --> 16:11.875
when we landed, and that's when
they caught us, but...

16:11.959 --> 16:14.041
before that, we were
completely invisible.

16:14.125 --> 16:15.917

16:17.709 --> 16:19.834

That's it. Look at that.
Th-They're not even

16:19.917 --> 16:21.959
remotely on a course
for Retepsia.

16:22.041 --> 16:25.834
The ion trail intersects with
a class-six absorption nebula

16:25.917 --> 16:27.583
approximately
12 light-years away.

16:27.667 --> 16:28.834
Gordon, set a pursuit course,

16:28.917 --> 16:30.250
-maximum speed.
-Aye, sir.

16:33.709 --> 16:36.333
What kind of research vessel
masks their ion trail?

16:36.417 --> 16:38.917
I don't think their mission has
anything to do with research.

16:52.917 --> 16:54.917
My God, that thing's got
to be over

16:55.000 --> 16:57.709
-a trillion kilometers across.
-Isaac?

16:57.792 --> 16:59.709
The trail leads directly inside.

16:59.792 --> 17:02.959
However, scans are unable
to penetrate the interior.

17:04.500 --> 17:05.750

17:25.417 --> 17:27.875
There. You see that?

17:27.959 --> 17:30.041

17:30.125 --> 17:32.166

Negative. However, the innermost

There are many more females

Many years ago we established

21:10.417 --> 21:13.333
a clandestine network of ships

21:13.417 --> 21:15.458

who sought refuge.

21:35.583 --> 21:37.417
We followed the transport alone.

21:37.500 --> 21:38.959
There are no other ships here.

21:39.041 --> 21:41.500

40:25.291 --> 40:27.667
This problem
is an internal matter

40:27.750 --> 40:29.667
for the Moclans
to handle themselves.

40:29.750 --> 40:32.417
The Union Council
is not a policing body.

40:32.500 --> 40:33.917
I must reluctantly agree.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
If the Union imposes its will

40:36.083 --> 40:38.583
on Moclus,
it sets a dangerous precedent.

40:38.667 --> 40:41.208
-Who will be next?
-HEVEENA: If you continue

40:41.291 --> 40:43.667
to let them oppress
their own people,

40:43.750 --> 40:46.458
what kind of precedent
does that set?

40:46.542 --> 40:48.709
We will renounce the Union
before we allow it

40:48.792 --> 40:51.625
to force-feed us
its own code of ethics.

40:51.709 --> 40:53.458
Ambassador, if you secede,
you'll be opening the door

40:53.542 --> 40:55.458
for the Kaylon
to destroy us all.

40:55.542 --> 40:58.000
Unless the Krill
allied themselves with us

40:58.083 --> 40:59.291
instead of the Union.

40:59.375 --> 41:01.375
It is likely they would

41:01.458 --> 41:03.583
follow the weapons.

41:03.667 --> 41:07.000
(crowd murmuring)

41:08.750 --> 41:10.667
Admiral, if I may.

41:11.750 --> 41:14.458
Ambassador,
the Moclans and the Krill

41:14.542 --> 41:16.917
can't stop the Kaylon alone,
and you know it.

41:17.000 --> 41:19.041
Moclus would be destroyed.

41:19.125 --> 41:21.500
But that little planet
inside the nebula

41:21.583 --> 41:24.166
might just be insignificant
enough to fly under the radar,

41:24.250 --> 41:25.625
and if that happens,

41:25.709 --> 41:28.250
the only Moclans
left in the galaxy

41:28.333 --> 41:30.667
would be female.

41:30.750 --> 41:34.709
But, hey, you'd still be
a single-sex species.

41:34.792 --> 41:36.500
(crowd murmuring)

41:41.750 --> 41:43.583
With the chairperson's
permission,

41:43.667 --> 41:46.333
I would like to propose
a provisional compromise.

41:46.417 --> 41:48.542
Proceed, Admiral Halsey.

41:49.959 --> 41:52.208
These are the terms I suggest:

41:52.291 --> 41:55.500
The Union agrees
not to recognize the sovereignty

41:55.583 --> 41:57.291
of the colony at this time,

41:57.375 --> 42:01.333
and the colonists agree
to end their clandestine

42:01.417 --> 42:03.667
emigration network,
effective immediately.

42:03.750 --> 42:05.542
In exchange,

42:05.625 --> 42:07.709
the Moclan government
shall agree

42:07.792 --> 42:09.417
to leave the colonists in peace

42:09.500 --> 42:10.959
and take no further action
against them

42:11.041 --> 42:13.583
now or in the future.

42:13.667 --> 42:15.458
(crowd murmuring)

42:17.667 --> 42:19.917
(grunting, yelling)

42:50.333 --> 42:52.750
(speaking Moclan)

42:55.709 --> 42:58.291
An agreement has been reached.

43:12.542 --> 43:13.834
You okay?

43:13.917 --> 43:16.000
Yes, Commander.

43:21.041 --> 43:22.625
It is all right.

43:22.709 --> 43:24.542
You are safe now.

Heveena, I am so sorry

43:58.000 --> 44:01.041
-for everything that's happened.
-It is true.

44:01.125 --> 44:02.875
We did not succeed.

44:02.959 --> 44:05.291
Not in the way we had hoped.

44:05.375 --> 44:07.291
But then, we did not fail.

44:07.375 --> 44:10.667
-You're remarkably optimistic.
-The women of this colony

44:10.750 --> 44:12.792

44:12.875 --> 44:15.625
undergoing forced
corrective surgery,

44:15.709 --> 44:19.542
and very likely spending the
rest of their lives in prison.

44:19.625 --> 44:21.083
But they are here,

44:21.166 --> 44:23.709

It is gone, that is so.

that bold first step,

44:35.834 --> 44:39.291
in time, others like us

I believe you will.
