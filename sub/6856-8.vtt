00:16.670 --> 00:19.452
<i>The clone war
threatens the unity of the Republic.</i>

00:19.577 --> 00:21.733
<i>As battles rage across the galaxy,</i>

00:21.942 --> 00:24.756
<i>more worlds had come
to the seductive lure of the Separatists</i>

00:24.881 --> 00:26.367
<i>and leave the Republic.</i>

00:26.492 --> 00:27.863
<i>On a vital mission of peace,</i>

00:28.225 --> 00:31.938
<i>Senator Padmé Amidala
journeys to Outer Rim world of Rodia</i>

00:32.063 --> 00:34.828
<i>desperate to ensure its loyalty remains
to the Republic.</i>

00:35.796 --> 00:36.955
<i>Senator Amidala,</i>

00:37.146 --> 00:40.333
<i>I just received words that you have
ventured through enemy territory</i>

00:40.458 --> 00:41.501
<i>into the Outer Rim</i>

00:41.904 --> 00:44.854
Senator Farr requested me personally,
Chancellor.

00:45.225 --> 00:48.139
His planet is in crisis.
His people are starving.

00:48.264 --> 00:51.762
He's a very old family friend.
I could not refuse his plea for help.

00:52.024 --> 00:53.326
<i>I understand,</i>

00:53.451 --> 00:57.142
<i>but in these dangerous times, you should
be accompanied by a clone escort.</i>

00:57.521 --> 00:59.239
This is a mission of peace.

00:59.364 --> 01:01.371
I put my faith in diplomacy.

01:01.649 --> 01:04.524
We can't solve all of our problems
by throwing troops at them.

01:04.694 --> 01:07.020
Yousa no needing to worry,
Chancellor.

01:07.145 --> 01:09.321
- As resempative of Nab...
- Jar Jar, look out!

01:21.274 --> 01:22.299
What is happening?

01:22.424 --> 01:24.795
<i>May I recommend
that only those who are qualified</i>

01:24.965 --> 01:27.798
<i>for these delicate peace talks
participate in them.</i>

01:30.883 --> 01:33.833
I will follow your advice, Chancellor.
Thank you.

01:50.509 --> 01:54.282
Lookee, lookee, it's a swamp planet
just like home. Meesa have to get going.

01:54.671 --> 01:58.620
Jar Jar, you would be doing me
a great favor by staying with the ship.

01:59.702 --> 02:02.457
Meesa knowing meesa be big help
with the negotiations.

02:02.781 --> 02:04.417
I need you to watch over 3PO.

02:04.827 --> 02:07.309
You know how
he always gets himself into trouble.

02:07.434 --> 02:09.465
Trouble, me?
Really.

02:09.934 --> 02:10.954
I won't be long.

02:11.539 --> 02:13.928
Meesa understands, My Lady.

02:16.269 --> 02:18.056
His Excellency, Ah-Twa.

02:34.827 --> 02:36.558
I've missed you so much.

02:36.683 --> 02:38.743
I was afraid you might not come.

02:39.374 --> 02:41.998
We are such a small
and humble system.

02:42.851 --> 02:45.209
Uncle Ono,
you are very important to me.

02:45.401 --> 02:47.765
We've been friends
since I was a little girl,

02:47.890 --> 02:50.462
when you were my father's
strongest ally in the Senate.

02:50.587 --> 02:52.947
Rodia is very important
to the Republic,

02:53.379 --> 02:55.051
and of course I'd come to help you.

02:55.276 --> 02:58.426
You speak of friendship
I have not witnessed of late.

02:58.676 --> 03:02.309
Where was the Republic when our
supply ships were destroyed by pirates?

03:03.147 --> 03:05.855
Where was the Republic
as my people starved?

03:06.248 --> 03:09.107
We have been stranded out here

03:09.460 --> 03:11.527
without any help at all.

03:12.001 --> 03:15.359
I know it is not your fault,
but my people starve

03:15.484 --> 03:16.657
all the same.

03:16.863 --> 03:19.638
I'm sure the Republic Senate
will approve a relief effort.

03:19.763 --> 03:23.288
The vote was postponed,
but you will get your food.

03:23.868 --> 03:25.800
I am sorry.

03:26.125 --> 03:27.877
It is too late, my sweet.

03:28.670 --> 03:32.088
The Separatist leader Nute Gunray
has promised to support us

03:32.693 --> 03:35.314
with a very generous relief effort.

03:39.078 --> 03:42.433
He is giving us food,
ships, and protection.

03:42.795 --> 03:45.568
Nute Gunray cannot be trusted.

03:45.693 --> 03:49.064
He will bring war to your system
just as he did to mine many years ago.

03:49.355 --> 03:50.611
I am afraid

03:50.736 --> 03:53.819
I have already done
what I must for my people.

04:02.013 --> 04:03.787
Viceroy, I should have known.

04:04.121 --> 04:06.498
<i>You won't get away this time,
Senator.</i>

04:06.722 --> 04:08.708
<i>Your friend made a deal with me,</i>

04:08.927 --> 04:10.734
<i>and you are part of it.</i>

04:11.265 --> 04:13.046
<i>3PO, come in, 3PO.</i>

04:13.369 --> 04:15.091
<i>- Stop her.</i>
- Three...

04:16.488 --> 04:18.137
<i>No one can help you now.</i>

04:18.843 --> 04:22.556
I am so sorry, my sweet.
I had no choice.

04:22.724 --> 04:24.270
There's always a choice.

04:24.395 --> 04:27.227
- To live in fear is no life at all.
<i>- Take her away.</i>

04:27.798 --> 04:30.587
Please, Uncle Ono, don't do this.

04:30.712 --> 04:33.484
<i>You have made a wise decision,
Senator.</i>

04:33.899 --> 04:37.896
<i>I will be there within the hour
to bring food for your people</i>

04:38.407 --> 04:40.501
<i>and collect my prize.</i>

04:45.505 --> 04:46.527
How rude.

04:46.784 --> 04:50.667
I'm afraid the local swamp life
doesn't have a very high opinion of us.

04:50.939 --> 04:53.461
- Whaten dey speaking?
- I couldn't possibly repeat it.

04:54.240 --> 04:56.167
Theesa swamp dwellers
just like meesa.

04:56.292 --> 04:58.820
I will convince them
of our good fellowship.

04:58.945 --> 05:00.378
Do be careful, Jar Jar.

05:00.503 --> 05:03.138
I don't think they're quite
like your friends on Naboo.

05:15.571 --> 05:16.776
Meesa make contact.

05:17.176 --> 05:18.176
Oh, dear.

05:27.133 --> 05:28.997
I don't think
that requires translation.

05:32.691 --> 05:35.336
Thisen is a different
swamp altogether. Sorry.

05:37.799 --> 05:39.994
Oh, my stars. Battle droids.

05:40.430 --> 05:41.676
Weesa in trouble now.

05:42.106 --> 05:43.639
Stop where you are.

05:45.218 --> 05:46.265
Wait for me!

05:51.698 --> 05:54.105
Jar Jar, you great webfoot,
you're squashing my circuits.

05:54.450 --> 05:55.775
Blast 'em.

05:57.110 --> 05:58.485
Wait, where are you going?

06:03.691 --> 06:05.409
Oh, no. I'll be crushed for sure.

06:05.577 --> 06:07.911
- Hang on, Three-so!
- It's 3PO.

06:10.679 --> 06:12.003
That was close.

06:16.093 --> 06:18.339
What are you doing?
Get me down at once.

06:30.997 --> 06:32.655
It's not too late.

06:32.780 --> 06:35.553
Uncle Ono,
you can stop this madness.

06:35.678 --> 06:37.303
Keep moving, prisoner.

06:41.123 --> 06:44.114
Look out, Jar Jar.
A crab droid is headed right for you.

06:44.416 --> 06:45.860
Headed for meesa?

06:46.355 --> 06:47.829
Yes, yousa!

06:50.852 --> 06:52.956
No, Jar Jar, go to your left.

06:53.125 --> 06:54.268
Behind you.

07:00.298 --> 07:01.335
Watch out.

07:02.273 --> 07:03.550
I can't bear to watch.

07:09.474 --> 07:11.956
Oh, no. Jar Jar's been killed.

07:12.287 --> 07:14.879
I knew something like this
would happen.

07:21.398 --> 07:24.684
What a horrible way to die,
and it's all my fault.

07:24.809 --> 07:26.087
He was so brave.

07:26.347 --> 07:28.605
Now he's gone forever.

07:30.064 --> 07:31.523
Meesa okay.

07:32.098 --> 07:33.617
Jar Jar, you're alive.

07:34.083 --> 07:35.912
Meesa okay, Three-so.

07:36.209 --> 07:37.337
Meesa okay.

07:38.582 --> 07:41.584
If you've finished messing around,
I need help.

07:46.051 --> 07:49.216
- Jar Jar, kindly don't do that.
- But meesa save-ed you.

07:56.933 --> 07:59.100
That's the end of our ship. Typical.

08:07.029 --> 08:08.568
Are those chains necessary?

08:09.510 --> 08:11.529
Welcome to the separatist way,
Senator.

08:11.856 --> 08:13.600
Viceroy Gunray's orders.

08:15.244 --> 08:17.285
I hope it's worth it to you.

08:18.247 --> 08:19.746
Thisa one big mess.

08:19.979 --> 08:21.707
Weesa going nowhere.

08:23.607 --> 08:26.169
Perhaps we should try
to contact the clone troopers.

08:26.599 --> 08:29.005
Lookee. Here's a button
that's still working.

08:31.897 --> 08:33.217
What did you break now?

08:33.386 --> 08:34.719
Meesa doing nothing.

08:35.048 --> 08:37.265
Thatsa looken like a Jedi robe.

08:37.506 --> 08:39.557
Whosa you supos'n this belongs to?

08:40.341 --> 08:41.831
I wouldn't know.

08:41.956 --> 08:44.606
But our only hope
is to hide in this closet

08:44.731 --> 08:46.761
until Mistress Padmé returns.

08:46.886 --> 08:48.698
If those droids attacking us,

08:48.823 --> 08:50.527
Padmé's probably in trouble.

08:50.806 --> 08:53.421
My Lady gave us
very specific instructions

08:53.546 --> 08:54.824
to remain here.

08:55.373 --> 08:58.034
Fiddlesticks.
We musta hafta try and saving her.

08:58.203 --> 09:00.707
Jar Jar Binks,
have you gone completely mad?

09:00.832 --> 09:02.782
You'll do more harm than good.

09:07.617 --> 09:10.353
Good. I shall meet
the Viceroy when he lands.

09:11.435 --> 09:13.591
What about
Senator Amidala's companions?

09:17.379 --> 09:19.607
If there are no signs
of her friends,

09:19.732 --> 09:21.882
they must have fled into the jungle.

09:22.007 --> 09:23.860
Yes, this is perfect.

09:24.341 --> 09:26.072
I want no sign of trouble.

09:26.197 --> 09:28.247
Our people need those supplies.

09:28.817 --> 09:31.526
Wait.
Meesa eyeball's stuck in the sleeve.

09:31.900 --> 09:34.750
- Just look at you.
- Something's wrongo here.

09:35.449 --> 09:38.784
The battle droids will surely
capture you, or worse, me.

09:39.079 --> 09:42.121
Not with thisa on.
Theysa won't be recognizing me.

09:42.554 --> 09:45.261
- You can't be serious.
- Co me on, Three-so,

09:45.386 --> 09:48.794
- we can do it.
- I have a very bad feeling about this.

10:00.755 --> 10:03.433
The citizens of Rodia
welcome you, Viceroy.

10:03.957 --> 10:05.785
Where is Senator Amidala?

10:06.370 --> 10:08.773
Awaiting your arrival as promised.

10:09.101 --> 10:10.101
Excellent.

10:10.381 --> 10:12.563
I do not wish to keep her waiting.

10:12.688 --> 10:13.757
Shall we go?

10:14.879 --> 10:17.405
We are holding the Senator
in the detention tower.

10:17.800 --> 10:20.493
I hope it is not too painful
for her.

10:24.331 --> 10:27.540
Sheesa up in that tower?
Weesa got to rescuing her.

10:27.927 --> 10:30.677
And how precisely
do you propose to do that?

10:34.426 --> 10:35.467
Look, a Jedi.

10:35.995 --> 10:37.015
We're doomed.

10:37.140 --> 10:38.490
- A Jedi?
- Jedi?

10:38.846 --> 10:40.096
Where's a Jedi?

10:40.221 --> 10:41.805
I do believe they mean you.

10:42.046 --> 10:44.396
- Meesa not a Jedi.
- Kill the Jedi.

10:44.851 --> 10:46.644
Don't shoot. We surrender!

10:47.583 --> 10:49.518
Forget surrender! Weesa run!

10:59.462 --> 11:01.775
- Is he dead?
- The Jedi got away.

11:02.320 --> 11:04.953
He slipped through this grate
and went underwater.

11:11.736 --> 11:13.028
Sound the alarm!

11:13.153 --> 11:14.338
Find that Jedi!

11:14.669 --> 11:17.549
I can see your busy,
so I'll just be going now.

11:17.719 --> 11:21.595
And take that Republic droid scum
to the dismantling center.

11:22.248 --> 11:24.931
Dismantling center?
Wait, wait. I'm innocent.

11:25.416 --> 11:27.166
I'm innocent, I tell you.

11:42.795 --> 11:44.316
Let's find that Jedi.

11:44.441 --> 11:45.591
Roger, roger.

11:48.657 --> 11:50.913
Take me to Senator Amidala at once!

12:01.067 --> 12:04.217
There's a bad boogie monster down there,
you betcha.

12:06.035 --> 12:08.347
Don't be fearing, Padmé.
Meesa coming.

12:13.137 --> 12:16.009
Better watch out.
There's a Jedi on the loose.

12:17.907 --> 12:20.151
You know,
you will soon be destroyed.

12:20.320 --> 12:22.696
I can't tell you how many times
I've seen battle droids

12:22.864 --> 12:24.698
sliced in half by a lone Jedi.

12:25.421 --> 12:28.034
Quiet you.
All right, cut the chatter.

12:28.214 --> 12:31.120
I want you troops to go outside
and secure the perimeter.

12:31.323 --> 12:33.901
You made it. I'm rescued at last.

12:34.026 --> 12:37.476
Hurry before the battle droids
figure out what's happening.

12:40.103 --> 12:42.153
- Quiet in there!
- Thank you.

12:42.658 --> 12:44.908
Let's get out of here, Master Jedi.

12:45.159 --> 12:46.159
Jedi?

12:49.814 --> 12:51.294
There's no Jedi in here.

12:51.419 --> 12:53.727
Wait, there's no prisoner in here.

12:54.022 --> 12:55.472
How did she do that?

13:00.010 --> 13:01.788
Where's the alarm button?

13:16.647 --> 13:18.197
I am a protocol droid

13:18.450 --> 13:21.318
- fluent in over 6 million forms of...
- Quiet.

13:27.763 --> 13:28.763
3PO.

13:28.962 --> 13:31.712
Mistress Padmé.
Thank The Maker you're safe.

13:32.119 --> 13:33.119
Have you...

13:36.326 --> 13:39.480
- Where's Jar Jar?
- I'm afraid he went to rescue you.

13:41.677 --> 13:44.011
- What about the Jedi?
- There is no Jedi.

13:44.136 --> 13:47.446
It appears the battle droids
have mistaken Jar Jar for one.

13:47.884 --> 13:48.863
That's not good.

13:50.389 --> 13:51.739
Hang on, My Lady.

13:52.182 --> 13:54.420
This is our chance
to capture Viceroy Gunray,

13:54.545 --> 13:56.147
but I need you to stay calm.

13:56.272 --> 13:58.207
Go back to the ship
and call for help.

13:58.497 --> 14:01.544
I regret the transmitters
on the ship are out of order.

14:01.905 --> 14:02.879
What?

14:03.004 --> 14:05.131
- The ship has been destroyed.
- Battle droids?

14:08.017 --> 14:10.291
All right,
then find a communications room

14:10.416 --> 14:11.992
and send out a distress signal.

14:12.117 --> 14:14.196
Hopefully there're some
clone ships within range.

14:14.321 --> 14:15.599
I'll track down Jar Jar.

14:24.649 --> 14:25.651
Viceroy Gunray,

14:26.197 --> 14:28.735
when can we expect
the supplies to arrive?

14:28.860 --> 14:30.588
My people are starving.

14:31.014 --> 14:32.491
They haven't arrived yet?

14:32.852 --> 14:36.233
I'm sorry. Your request
will be taken into consideration

14:36.542 --> 14:38.914
after Senator Amidala's execution.

14:39.539 --> 14:40.579
Execution?

14:40.837 --> 14:41.877
You can't.

14:42.154 --> 14:44.503
She's a prisoner of war.
We were promised.

14:44.792 --> 14:46.646
You are under my protection now,

14:46.771 --> 14:49.121
and you will do
what I demand of you.

14:56.093 --> 14:57.343
Padmé was right.

14:57.716 --> 15:00.895
I have made a grave mistake
joining with the separatists.

15:03.125 --> 15:04.375
I know, I know.

15:04.814 --> 15:06.765
We must appease Viceroy Gunray

15:06.932 --> 15:09.012
so he does not destroy us all.

15:09.651 --> 15:11.440
Be on alert for that Jedi.

15:11.846 --> 15:13.659
He is our only hope.

15:20.376 --> 15:22.780
Bring Senator Amidala before me.

15:23.965 --> 15:26.629
She caused a great deal
of damage to our droids,

15:26.796 --> 15:28.285
and she escaped, sir.

15:28.669 --> 15:30.496
- Escaped?
- It's the Jedi!

15:31.768 --> 15:32.894
Shoot him!

15:46.492 --> 15:48.927
Thisa rescuing is hard jobbing.

15:59.816 --> 16:00.713
Capture her!

16:21.165 --> 16:22.005
Oh, dear.

16:23.477 --> 16:25.634
The Jedi has been spotted
in the south hall.

16:26.117 --> 16:28.165
- Let's move.
- Roger, roger.

16:29.733 --> 16:31.812
I think that was rather clever.

16:34.918 --> 16:36.102
Sir, over there!

16:36.506 --> 16:37.770
The Jedi is escaping.

16:38.103 --> 16:39.103
Not likely.

16:58.357 --> 17:00.042
Freeze. Surrender.

17:00.228 --> 17:01.377
Where did she go?

17:02.337 --> 17:03.201
What the...

17:19.878 --> 17:21.397
Senator Amidala.

17:22.900 --> 17:25.747
So good to see you at last.

17:28.446 --> 17:30.574
Hello?
I say, is anyone there?

17:32.033 --> 17:34.328
Why is there never an R2 unit
when you need one?

17:34.671 --> 17:36.872
<i>This is a restricted frequency.
Who is this?</i>

17:37.307 --> 17:39.370
I am C-3PO, human-cyborg...

17:39.537 --> 17:41.814
<i>No droids.
This code is for military use only.</i>

17:41.981 --> 17:43.501
This is a priority message

17:43.668 --> 17:45.810
from Senator Amidala on Rodia.

17:46.043 --> 17:48.277
- We require immediate assist...
- Hold it.

17:48.444 --> 17:50.635
- Oh, dear.
- You're under arrest.

17:51.078 --> 17:53.514
So you didn't find the Jedi, then?

17:53.994 --> 17:55.474
You got him, boss.

17:55.724 --> 17:58.319
Too bad you can't take out
that slug monster.

18:05.473 --> 18:06.891
Yousa okay, bogey?

18:07.134 --> 18:09.695
Yousa save-ed me.
Yousa my new palo.

18:14.469 --> 18:15.945
Mistress Padmé,

18:16.235 --> 18:17.745
where you able to find Jar Jar?

18:18.047 --> 18:19.915
I think Jar Jar's dead, 3PO.

18:20.312 --> 18:21.411
Not again.

18:21.578 --> 18:23.030
Oh, poor Jar Jar.

18:23.197 --> 18:25.169
He was always such a misfit.

18:29.755 --> 18:31.759
I want to make sure this time.

18:32.134 --> 18:33.829
Don't do this, Viceroy.

18:33.996 --> 18:37.682
I beg you, do not kill her.
There must be another way.

18:38.168 --> 18:39.168
Silence!

18:39.585 --> 18:41.434
I say, I think there has been

18:41.601 --> 18:43.151
some horrible mistake.

18:43.350 --> 18:45.524
I am a protocol droid
on a diplomatic...

18:45.975 --> 18:46.975
Ready.

18:48.728 --> 18:49.526
Aim.

18:54.699 --> 18:56.126
It's the Jedi!

18:57.848 --> 19:00.289
- It's the Je... Juh...
- Jedi.

19:00.607 --> 19:02.039
Release the Senator.

19:02.912 --> 19:04.543
That Jedi is going to attack.

19:05.961 --> 19:07.337
Shoot him!
Shoot them all!

19:15.517 --> 19:17.389
That Jedi has summoned a monster.

19:31.361 --> 19:33.231
We have to get out of here.

19:47.915 --> 19:49.545
I made a very good friend.

19:50.065 --> 19:52.176
Hold it right there, Viceroy.

19:53.724 --> 19:56.428
At last we can finish this.

19:56.791 --> 19:58.881
Onaconda, it is about time.

19:59.357 --> 20:01.892
Blast that Jedi and shoot her!

20:09.152 --> 20:11.064
Uncle Ono, I think it's time

20:11.231 --> 20:13.611
to tell the Viceroy
about our little secret,

20:14.007 --> 20:16.113
how you never meant
to leave the Republic

20:16.364 --> 20:18.742
and how you truly care what's best
for your people.

20:19.247 --> 20:20.868
What is she talking about?

20:21.285 --> 20:23.568
Sorry, Viceroy, she is right.

20:24.068 --> 20:25.741
I am with the Republic,

20:25.908 --> 20:28.043
and you are under arrest.

20:28.367 --> 20:31.797
You will pay for this treachery.

20:32.358 --> 20:35.342
Viceroy, you are going to spend
the rest of the war in a cell.

20:35.878 --> 20:38.261
Your victory will be fleeting,
Senators.

20:43.133 --> 20:44.910
Those are Republic warships.

20:45.077 --> 20:46.770
The clones have arrived.

20:50.470 --> 20:53.192
We got your message, general.
What are your orders?

20:53.625 --> 20:55.445
My message got through.

20:55.879 --> 20:58.027
Take this separatist scum away.

20:58.781 --> 20:59.783
Master Bombad,

21:00.175 --> 21:02.995
on behalf of the people of Rodia,
I thank you.

21:03.877 --> 21:05.198
You're either the bravest

21:05.365 --> 21:08.083
or the most foolish Jedi
I have ever met.

21:08.687 --> 21:10.960
I'm just a gungan,
and I don't think I'm either.

21:11.339 --> 21:14.005
Well, I think
you're a little bit of both.

21:17.220 --> 21:20.929
<i>Senator Amidala has brought
your people's needs to my attention,</i>

21:21.183 --> 21:24.683
<i>and I have already sent a convoy
of supply ships to your system.</i>

21:25.128 --> 21:26.350
Thank you, Chancellor.

21:26.662 --> 21:29.813
<i>The capture of Viceroy Gunray
is a major victory for the Republic.</i>

21:30.480 --> 21:32.566
<i>All of you should be commended
for your courage,</i>

21:32.916 --> 21:36.553
<i>and from what I hear,
especially you representative Binks.</i>

21:36.720 --> 21:38.112
Ah, it'sa nothing.

21:41.163 --> 21:43.117
Can you ever forgive me, Padmé?

21:43.464 --> 21:46.620
It is the Republic that should be asking
your forgiveness, my old friend.

21:47.154 --> 21:50.318
Far too often, we forget
that our most important allies

21:50.485 --> 21:52.724
are not always the most powerful.
