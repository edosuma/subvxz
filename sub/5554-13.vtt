WEBVTT

00:01.335 --> 00:03.367
(insects trilling)

00:06.238 --> 00:07.637
Perimeter clear.

00:07.639 --> 00:10.172
Another 50 meters,
then we RTB until order...

00:10.174 --> 00:12.174
Son of a bitch!

00:12.176 --> 00:14.442
(automatic gunfire)
Move!

00:14.444 --> 00:16.310
(indistinct shouting)

00:16.312 --> 00:19.379
There's a structure
ten meters east!

00:19.381 --> 00:21.414
We hit 'em hard
for a three-count,

00:21.416 --> 00:22.381
then Oscar Mike!

00:22.383 --> 00:24.449
Now!

00:27.420 --> 00:28.185
Go, go!

00:28.187 --> 00:29.753
(gunfire continues)

00:35.727 --> 00:38.260
Captain, our intel said
this quadrant was vacant.

00:38.262 --> 00:40.428
Yeah, well, we're looking at

00:40.430 --> 00:42.129
at least 12 well-armed
unfriendlies,

00:42.131 --> 00:43.430
so I'd say our intel was wrong.

00:43.432 --> 00:45.331
Situation's pear-shaped.

00:45.333 --> 00:46.432
MAN:
Ready?

00:46.434 --> 00:48.367
(continues indistinctly)

00:50.337 --> 00:53.037
This is Special Forces
Captain Cody Decker!

00:53.039 --> 00:55.372
My detachment's pinned down
at a rock formation

00:55.374 --> 00:57.140
50 yards from our truck.

00:58.676 --> 01:00.509
(upbeat music plays)

01:04.481 --> 01:06.280
You sure you know
what you're doing?

01:06.282 --> 01:08.615
I am a hypochondriac.

01:08.617 --> 01:10.717
I've been taking my own blood
pressure since I was nine.

01:10.719 --> 01:12.518
WALTER:
Why is Sylvester

01:12.520 --> 01:14.186
administering you medical care?

01:14.188 --> 01:15.787
My doctor says
my numbers are up.

01:15.789 --> 01:16.821
He wants me to check it
every morning.

01:16.823 --> 01:18.522
You're in good shape.

01:18.524 --> 01:19.356
Why would you have
high blood pressure?

01:19.358 --> 01:21.191
Happy New Year!

01:21.193 --> 01:22.725
I got bagels!

01:24.328 --> 01:25.727
You were saying?

01:25.729 --> 01:28.429
One egg for Ralphy-boy...

01:28.431 --> 01:30.664
A sesame for Happy...

01:36.437 --> 01:37.402
It's all right.

01:38.505 --> 01:40.137
It's just an accident.

01:40.139 --> 01:42.272
Who are you? What have you done
with Unhappy Quinn?

01:42.274 --> 01:44.574
Saying "yes"
to offers of kindness

01:44.576 --> 01:46.475
is easier than saying
"no, thank you."

01:46.477 --> 01:47.742
One-third the
syllables,

01:47.744 --> 01:49.376
but twice as positive.

01:49.378 --> 01:50.343
Where have I heard
that before?

01:50.345 --> 01:52.511
It's Quincy Berkstead!

01:52.513 --> 01:54.379
The man who stole
your fiancée?

01:54.381 --> 01:55.446
My nemesis.

01:55.448 --> 01:56.647
(clears throat)

01:58.617 --> 01:59.682
What?

02:03.487 --> 02:06.321
<i> Your Essential Strategies</i>
<i> for Saying Yes to Life.</i>

02:06.323 --> 02:08.289
Why are you reading
this snake oil?

02:08.291 --> 02:10.491
I am just trying
something new for New Year's.

02:10.493 --> 02:12.826
Be a bit more positive,
a little less...

02:12.828 --> 02:14.594
mean and sarcastic.

02:14.596 --> 02:16.495
The only thing dumber
than Quincy Berkstead

02:16.497 --> 02:18.463
is a New Year's resolution
based on his drivel.

02:18.465 --> 02:20.665
Resolutions are a chopportunity.

02:22.235 --> 02:24.401
A "challenging opportunity"?

02:24.403 --> 02:27.170
One: please do not quote
that quack to me.

02:27.172 --> 02:28.504
And two: resolutions don't work.

02:28.506 --> 02:31.507
Do, too; you just got
to have willpower.

02:31.509 --> 02:32.474
Oh, really?

02:32.476 --> 02:34.609
Give up the rocket fuel.

02:34.611 --> 02:36.477
You must drink, like,
12 mugs a day.

02:36.479 --> 02:39.513
I survived Camp
Lejeune boot camp.

02:39.515 --> 02:41.414
You don't think
I can kick coffee?

02:41.416 --> 02:42.548
Break from caffeine

02:42.550 --> 02:43.549
might help
with the blood pressure.

02:43.551 --> 02:45.384
So would a break
from this place.

02:45.386 --> 02:46.885
50 bucks you can't go one day.

02:54.827 --> 02:56.359
Actually, defined
start and end times

02:56.361 --> 02:58.527
for goals demand
efficiency.

02:58.529 --> 03:00.395
For example,
Megan told me to "open up"

03:00.397 --> 03:02.797
and to not be afraid
of relationships,

03:02.799 --> 03:06.400
so this year I have resolved
to be more social.

03:06.402 --> 03:07.567
That's great.
Proud of you.

03:07.569 --> 03:09.869
And research uncovered
an Armenian family

03:09.871 --> 03:11.437
that is incredibly effective

03:11.439 --> 03:13.572
at social media,
very popular online,

03:13.574 --> 03:17.375
though they, they do show
their buttocks quite often.

03:17.377 --> 03:19.143
Those are the Kardashians.

03:19.145 --> 03:21.478
Stars of social media
aren't "social."

03:21.480 --> 03:23.513
They're not actually friends
with their followers.

03:23.515 --> 03:25.065
Oh, no, on the contrary.

03:25.066 --> 03:26.616
Online, the word "friend"
is used as a verb.

03:26.618 --> 03:28.484
Um, my analysis shows

03:28.486 --> 03:30.452
videos of animals
engaged in human activity

03:30.454 --> 03:33.254
perform quite well.

03:33.256 --> 03:35.222
Especially when
set to music.

03:35.224 --> 03:36.456
I tested my theory.

03:36.458 --> 03:38.391
(tinny music playing)

03:38.392 --> 03:40.325
WALTER (deadpan):
I am a ferret making a meal.

03:40.328 --> 03:42.461
Is that my dollhouse furniture?

03:42.463 --> 03:44.296
This isn't how you make friends.

03:44.298 --> 03:46.114
It's how you
lose friends.

03:46.115 --> 03:47.931
Well, I ha-- I have 17,000 likes
in ten hours.

03:47.934 --> 03:49.333
PAIGE:
Socialization is

03:49.335 --> 03:52.369
going out and meeting
actual human beings.

03:52.371 --> 03:54.604
Like Ralph's doing
with Forestry Braves.

03:54.606 --> 03:56.305
I just like mineralogy.

03:56.307 --> 03:58.373
O-Okay, but there's also
being outside

03:58.375 --> 04:00.241
and singing songs,
tying knots...

04:00.243 --> 04:02.375
About that...

04:05.346 --> 04:08.714
I'm happy to go with Ralph
to his campout next week

04:08.716 --> 04:10.282
and I will help him practice
for his merit badges,

04:10.284 --> 04:11.716
but I draw the line
at knot-tying.

04:11.718 --> 04:13.217
Why?

04:13.219 --> 04:14.851
It's old technology

04:14.853 --> 04:17.186
that has been replaced
with clips and Velcro.

04:17.188 --> 04:19.388
It's not efficient.

04:19.390 --> 04:20.722
And no campfire songs.

04:20.724 --> 04:22.457
Instead of inviting
another kid to this thing,

04:22.459 --> 04:23.925
he invited you,

04:23.927 --> 04:26.294
a 32-year-old man,

04:26.296 --> 04:27.579
and that is so sad.

04:27.580 --> 04:28.863
So you'll sing the songs
and eat the s'mores.

04:28.865 --> 04:30.731
I need Ralph
making friends there.

04:30.733 --> 04:32.432
He's not
a natural at it.

04:32.434 --> 04:34.534
I always wish
I'd given him a sibling.

04:34.536 --> 04:36.502
A single mom to two kids?

04:36.504 --> 04:37.636
Sure, that would've
fixed everything.

04:37.638 --> 04:39.304
I just feel guilty.

04:39.306 --> 04:41.372
And a sibling would've maybe
taught him to fit in better.

04:41.374 --> 04:43.240
So just help him
be a normal kid

04:43.242 --> 04:44.307
and tie the damn knots.

04:44.309 --> 04:45.908
Deputy Cooper.
New Year's bagel?

04:45.910 --> 04:47.309
No, thank you.

04:47.311 --> 04:48.543
Easier to say "yes."

04:48.545 --> 04:49.744
After the case we just caught,

04:49.746 --> 04:51.278
I don't have
much of an appetite.

04:52.681 --> 04:54.614
Pentagon's lost contact
with one of its

04:54.616 --> 04:56.949
low geosynchronous orbit
satellites.

04:56.951 --> 04:58.951
It controls
military drones

04:58.953 --> 05:00.686
used to support
military missions.

05:00.688 --> 05:02.387
And we need it fixed ASAP.

05:02.389 --> 05:03.488
Why so urgent?

05:03.490 --> 05:06.324
Because of this.

05:06.326 --> 05:08.759
(gunfire)

05:08.761 --> 05:10.927
This is Special Forces
Captain Cody Decker!

05:10.929 --> 05:13.496
My detachment's pinned down
at a rock formation

05:13.498 --> 05:14.797
50 yards from our truck.

05:14.799 --> 05:17.866
Estimate outnumbered
12 to four.

05:17.868 --> 05:19.767
Limited ammo,
cannot disengage safely.

05:19.769 --> 05:22.302
Sun just went down,
but by daybreak

05:22.304 --> 05:24.337
our small numbers
will be exposed

05:24.339 --> 05:25.471
and we will be neutralized.

05:25.473 --> 05:27.239
Request immediate support!

05:27.241 --> 05:28.640
COOPER:
We received this

05:28.642 --> 05:31.242
30 minutes ago,
but the feed is unreliable.

05:31.244 --> 05:33.010
Special Forces,
small detachment,

05:33.012 --> 05:34.878
recent sunset.

05:34.880 --> 05:35.879
Darfur?

05:35.881 --> 05:37.247
Correct.

05:37.249 --> 05:38.681
We sent a four-man strike team

05:38.683 --> 05:40.849
to take out
a genocidal warlord

05:40.851 --> 05:41.950
who's been
eviscerating

05:41.952 --> 05:43.685
border-town farming villages.

05:43.687 --> 05:45.353
So you need your geniuses

05:45.355 --> 05:47.021
to code a patch that'll
reconnect the satellite

05:47.023 --> 05:48.322
so you can send in drones

05:48.324 --> 05:49.840
to give cover
to Decker and his men.

05:49.841 --> 05:51.357
So they can make their way
back to their vehicle

05:51.360 --> 05:53.326
equipped with repeat-fire
grenade launchers,

05:53.328 --> 05:55.294
blow out of there.

05:55.296 --> 05:56.428
PAIGE: Why not send
a plane instead?

05:56.430 --> 05:58.329
Assume it's
a top secret operation

05:58.331 --> 05:59.997
without congressional
approval...

05:59.999 --> 06:01.865
we can't send war planes if
we're not supposed to be there.

06:01.867 --> 06:03.933
Do you guys even read
the Constitution anymore?

06:03.935 --> 06:06.402
SYLVESTER: The drone's satellite
is on a polarcentric orbit.

06:06.404 --> 06:08.670
Should be over
Antarctica in 12 hours.

06:08.672 --> 06:10.304
And that is
important why?

06:10.306 --> 06:12.306
Well, the atmosphere
is thinnest at the poles.

06:12.308 --> 06:14.875
Makes it easier for the signals
to get to the satellite.

06:14.877 --> 06:17.744
U.S. research facility McMurdo
is stationed in Antarctica.

06:17.746 --> 06:18.978
But it's in a valley,

06:18.980 --> 06:20.830
so its wireless
connectivity isn't ideal.

06:20.831 --> 06:22.681
But if we can get to one of
its remote testing labs...

06:22.683 --> 06:25.050
Set up shop,
reconnect the signal;

06:25.052 --> 06:27.485
you send the drones,
soldiers live.

06:27.487 --> 06:28.586
PAIGE:
Why send us

06:28.588 --> 06:29.853
if McMurdo's got scientists?

06:29.855 --> 06:30.854
TOBY:
They're geologists.

06:30.856 --> 06:31.855
They know mineral bed-loads,

06:31.857 --> 06:32.956
not capacity downloads.

06:32.958 --> 06:34.857
Oy! Wordplay.

06:34.859 --> 06:36.892
Okay, so if we leave
now for the South Pole,

06:36.894 --> 06:39.094
we can get there
by 10:00 p.m.

06:39.095 --> 06:41.295
That gives us 51 minutes
until the sun rises in Darfur,

06:41.298 --> 06:43.364
exposing Captain Decker
to certain death.

06:43.366 --> 06:44.965
I'll make the calls. WALTER:
Okay, guys, pack up.

06:44.967 --> 06:47.033
Oh, Sly, you're gonna
have to stay here.

06:47.035 --> 06:49.535
Track the satellite and
feed us its coordinates.

06:49.537 --> 06:50.769
Copy that.

06:52.372 --> 06:54.205
It's gonna be cold there.

06:54.206 --> 06:56.039
That doesn't look
like hot cocoa.

08:47.130 --> 08:49.430
(wind gusting)

08:51.734 --> 08:53.834
Blow me down,
that was a big one.

08:53.836 --> 08:56.703
I think this storm's picking up
faster than the pilot predicted.

08:56.705 --> 08:58.604
(wind gusting)

09:01.408 --> 09:02.540
Forget about that storm
picking up;

09:02.541 --> 09:03.673
I'm worried about
this hut picking up.

09:03.676 --> 09:05.075
These things are built

09:05.077 --> 09:06.409
to withstand
these weather fronts.

09:06.411 --> 09:08.944
Okay, Sly,
I'm turning on the antenna.

09:09.913 --> 09:11.579
Sending up the patch on three.

09:11.581 --> 09:14.582
One... two... three.

09:15.818 --> 09:17.150
You send the patch?

09:17.152 --> 09:18.151
I got nothing over here.

09:18.152 --> 09:19.151
This have something
to do with it?

09:20.755 --> 09:22.654
Oh, man, the signal crashed.

09:22.656 --> 09:24.022
Okay, I'll reposition
the antenna.

09:24.024 --> 09:26.457
(wind gusting)

09:33.532 --> 09:35.131
The antenna's not the problem.

09:35.133 --> 09:36.966
The storm's interfering
with the reception.

09:36.968 --> 09:38.468
Well, that's gonna
be an issue,

09:38.469 --> 09:39.969
because you need at least
a five signal strength

09:39.971 --> 09:41.537
to get that software
up to the satellite.

09:41.539 --> 09:44.139
The pilot said the storm
could last an hour.

09:44.141 --> 09:46.040
Walter, Decker and his team
don't have an hour.

09:46.042 --> 09:48.442
Sunrise is in about 45 minutes
and then they're toast.

09:48.444 --> 09:50.177
Okay, give me a minute.

09:52.781 --> 09:55.548
I got it.
I got it.

09:57.518 --> 09:58.984
Walter, you thinking what
I think you're thinking?

09:58.986 --> 10:00.819
Only if you think
that I'm thinking

10:00.820 --> 10:02.653
that this map shows
an elevated ridge 90 meters away

10:02.656 --> 10:04.522
from the antenna that will
send a stronger signal.

10:04.524 --> 10:06.724
Remember what the helicopter man
said about going outside?

10:06.726 --> 10:08.058
Not to. He said not to.

10:08.060 --> 10:10.894
There are four brave men
out there, counting on us.

10:10.896 --> 10:12.629
And no one else to help.

10:12.631 --> 10:14.764
I'm aware of the stakes
and I want to save them,

10:14.766 --> 10:16.699
but like the song says:
baby, it's cold outside.

10:16.701 --> 10:17.933
Let's do it.

10:17.935 --> 10:19.268
It's all about "yes."

10:19.269 --> 10:20.602
Oh, really?
You want to make out?

10:21.638 --> 10:23.037
Guys, focus.
We're about to head back

10:23.039 --> 10:24.972
into subfreezing temperatures.

10:24.974 --> 10:26.740
Now, Toby, how do we
prepare physically?

10:26.742 --> 10:27.974
Okay, if we're gonna do this,

10:27.976 --> 10:29.108
we should each eat
a protein bar,

10:29.110 --> 10:30.809
'cause staying warm
burns calories

10:30.811 --> 10:32.110
and we'll be
expending energy

10:32.112 --> 10:33.478
trudging through
all that snow.

10:33.480 --> 10:36.180
All right,
you heard the man, chow down.

10:36.182 --> 10:38.649
And I'll be tying a rope
around each of our waists

10:38.651 --> 10:41.151
with 15 feet in between,
so we can't get separated.

10:41.153 --> 10:42.986
Now, we're in
the South Pole,

10:42.988 --> 10:44.153
so compasses don't work,

10:44.155 --> 10:45.487
so we'll have to rely on

10:45.489 --> 10:47.655
old-school
navigation techniques.

10:47.657 --> 10:50.190
Forestry Brave Ralph,
any thoughts on the matter?

10:50.192 --> 10:51.124
Count your steps
and leave a trail

10:51.126 --> 10:52.591
to find your way back to base.

10:56.163 --> 10:59.497
300-foot cable
should do the trick.

11:01.100 --> 11:02.699
We ready?

11:06.037 --> 11:07.937
Guys, Doppler radar says

11:07.938 --> 11:09.838
you are walking out
into essentially a blizzard.

11:11.074 --> 11:13.774
Wow, what a great chopportunity.

11:38.767 --> 11:40.833
♪ ♪

11:54.081 --> 11:56.581
This is slower going
than I thought, Paige.

11:56.583 --> 11:57.582
Time check?

11:57.584 --> 11:58.883
38 minutes.

11:58.885 --> 12:00.885
TOBY: I had an Aunt Edie
when I was little.

12:00.887 --> 12:02.920
300 pounds.

12:02.922 --> 12:04.955
Hugged me so tight;
it was just like this.

12:04.957 --> 12:07.123
Couldn't see a thing
and felt like you were dying.

12:07.125 --> 12:08.891
My toes are getting numb!

12:08.893 --> 12:11.093
You're small;
you have less insulation.

12:11.095 --> 12:12.861
You'll feel it before we do.

12:12.863 --> 12:14.329
Hey, Walter!

12:14.331 --> 12:15.730
Shouldn't we be there yet?

12:15.732 --> 12:17.965
We should,
but it's all estimation.

12:17.967 --> 12:19.733
We're working blind here.

12:19.735 --> 12:21.768
Sly, I've counted 90 meters.

12:21.770 --> 12:23.069
How much further?

12:23.071 --> 12:24.737
I can barely hear you,

12:24.739 --> 12:26.805
but I think you asked
for a distance check?

12:26.807 --> 12:28.640
In 20 to 30 paces,

12:28.642 --> 12:30.308
you will come
to a small rock outcrop

12:30.310 --> 12:31.809
where you can set up
the antenna.

12:33.779 --> 12:34.944
(grunts)

12:34.946 --> 12:37.046
Hey, Cabe, are you okay?

12:37.048 --> 12:38.714
Yeah, I can handle it!

12:38.716 --> 12:40.199
I'm not sure I can.

12:40.200 --> 12:41.683
I don't think I have
20 paces left in me.

12:41.685 --> 12:43.618
Oh, you don't have to. Look!

12:43.620 --> 12:44.919
HAPPY:
Look where?

12:44.921 --> 12:46.270
I can't see you,

12:46.271 --> 12:47.620
and you're ten feet
in front of me.

12:47.623 --> 12:48.822
Cabe, do you see it?

12:48.824 --> 12:49.823
Barely!

12:49.825 --> 12:52.091
Just a few more steps, guys!

12:52.093 --> 12:53.992
You get that signal
up to the satellite,

12:53.994 --> 12:56.694
the drones get sent to Decker,
and we've got time to spare.

12:56.696 --> 12:58.996
HAPPY:
Okay, let's get this antenna up.

12:58.998 --> 13:00.263
We're gonna pull this off.

13:01.366 --> 13:04.700
Uh, oh, boy.
What happened?

13:04.702 --> 13:07.035
The temperature dropped faster
than we could've anticipated.

13:07.037 --> 13:08.636
The poles are frozen

13:08.638 --> 13:10.004
and the connecting struts
snapped.

13:10.006 --> 13:11.839
We can't put
this antenna together.

13:11.841 --> 13:13.640
Can't you guys just hold it up?

13:13.642 --> 13:14.874
This wind will blow the poles

13:14.876 --> 13:16.342
right out of our hands
in two seconds.

13:16.344 --> 13:18.194
I need this locked in tight,

13:18.195 --> 13:20.045
not held by people who can
barely feel their fingers.

13:22.015 --> 13:23.848
Let's wedge it in over there.

13:23.850 --> 13:25.916
We have no other choice.

13:27.185 --> 13:28.384
Hello? What am I looking at?

13:28.386 --> 13:30.753
Holy cow,
the feed's working again.

13:30.755 --> 13:31.854
Is anyone there?

13:31.856 --> 13:33.655
Captain Decker, can you hear us?

13:33.657 --> 13:35.890
I neither confirm nor deny
my identity.

13:35.892 --> 13:37.157
Who am I speaking with?

13:37.159 --> 13:38.858
I-I'm Paige Dineen.
This is Sylvester Dodd.

13:38.860 --> 13:40.626
We're Homeland Security
contractors

13:40.628 --> 13:42.260
helping you get the drone
diversion you need.

13:42.262 --> 13:43.828
It's almost daylight!

13:43.830 --> 13:45.362
Once the sun comes up,
they'll overtake us.

13:45.364 --> 13:47.063
When are the drones coming?

13:48.966 --> 13:50.231
Our team is on it.

13:50.233 --> 13:51.865
They're working
as fast as they can.

13:51.867 --> 13:54.400
We're four men holding off
a dozen unfriendlies.

13:54.402 --> 13:56.101
There's a very short clock
on us.

13:57.204 --> 13:58.236
Special forces

13:58.238 --> 13:59.637
wear diver's watches, right?

13:59.639 --> 14:00.904
You got a kid with you?

14:00.906 --> 14:02.272
Great.

14:02.274 --> 14:04.207
And you're the ones saving us?

14:04.209 --> 14:05.875
I'm Ralph.
If you want to buy some time,

14:05.877 --> 14:07.142
you should break the glass
of all your watches

14:07.144 --> 14:08.676
and throw them far from you.

14:08.678 --> 14:10.844
The moonlight will reflect
off of it, and bad guys

14:10.846 --> 14:12.879
will think there are a lot more
soldiers than just you four.

14:12.881 --> 14:14.881
They think we got
bigger numbers,

14:14.883 --> 14:16.048
they'll save ammo,

14:16.050 --> 14:17.949
fire at us less.

14:17.951 --> 14:20.017
That works.

14:20.019 --> 14:22.019
Guys, you heard the kid.

14:22.988 --> 14:25.787
You never cease to amaze me.

14:28.658 --> 14:29.857
CABE: Is it fitting in?

14:29.859 --> 14:31.859
HAPPY: Uh, I think so.

14:31.861 --> 14:33.026
I can't see two inches
in front of me.

14:33.028 --> 14:34.894
Push down harder!

14:35.930 --> 14:37.696
(grunts)

14:37.698 --> 14:39.130
Ah, damn it!

14:39.132 --> 14:40.865
It's just too cold.

14:40.867 --> 14:42.417
Quitting is not an option!

14:42.418 --> 14:43.968
We're trying, Cabe, but we
can't control the weather!

14:43.970 --> 14:46.737
No, we can't, but we can use it
to our advantage.

14:46.739 --> 14:50.707
So, everything around here
freezes instantly, even metal.

14:50.709 --> 14:51.908
So we pour water

14:51.910 --> 14:53.309
around the base of the poles.

14:53.311 --> 14:55.010
The water instantly freezes

14:55.012 --> 14:56.711
into a solid block of ice,

14:56.713 --> 14:58.946
and not even the wind
can blow it over.

14:58.948 --> 15:01.448
Makes sense, but how do we melt
ice in the Antarctic Circle?

15:01.450 --> 15:04.884
Back in the hut,
there are crates of MREs

15:04.886 --> 15:06.085
from McMurdo!

15:06.087 --> 15:08.253
They come
with mini heating units

15:08.255 --> 15:09.787
to warm food and drinks!

15:09.789 --> 15:11.155
By the time you get
down to the hut

15:11.157 --> 15:12.689
and make it back up
to the ridge,

15:12.691 --> 15:14.341
you will have a small window

15:14.342 --> 15:15.992
before the satellite is out
of range to make a connection.

15:15.994 --> 15:17.994
WALTER: You heard Sly,
we got to move.

15:17.996 --> 15:19.996
Follow the cable back!

15:19.998 --> 15:22.064
(rumbling)

15:22.066 --> 15:23.832
What the hell is that?

15:23.834 --> 15:25.366
I can't see for sure,

15:25.368 --> 15:26.734
but is that an ice shelf
above us?

15:26.736 --> 15:28.168
Chunks are about to come off.
Look out!

15:39.113 --> 15:40.412
You okay?

15:40.414 --> 15:41.479
I believe so. Toby, Toby?

15:41.481 --> 15:42.746
Walter, is that you?
Yeah.

15:42.748 --> 15:43.780
Come on, come on.

15:43.782 --> 15:45.782
Hey, Happy, you all right?

15:45.784 --> 15:48.117
Happy?
Quinn, where you at?

15:48.119 --> 15:50.036
Rope's 15 feet long,

15:50.037 --> 15:51.954
far enough for her not to be
able to hear you in this mess.

15:51.956 --> 15:53.021
Guys, something's wrong.

15:53.023 --> 15:54.422
This rope has too much give.

15:55.992 --> 15:58.025
The rope's cut!

15:58.027 --> 16:00.227
A falling ice block
must have severed it.

16:00.229 --> 16:01.828
Happy!
Happy!

16:01.830 --> 16:02.929
Happy!
Happy!

16:02.931 --> 16:05.097
ALL:
Happy! Happy!

16:05.099 --> 16:07.165
Doc!

16:09.969 --> 16:13.003
Walt!

16:13.005 --> 16:15.171
Anyone!

16:19.310 --> 16:20.809
My comm fell out.

16:22.445 --> 16:24.511
Ah... ah.

16:34.322 --> 16:36.388
Toby!

16:37.524 --> 16:39.790
(whimpering)

16:41.126 --> 16:43.893
Toby!

16:48.232 --> 16:50.198
Guys, we're not getting anything
from Happy's comms here,

16:50.200 --> 16:51.265
not even a signal.

16:51.267 --> 16:52.799
If it fell in the snow,

16:52.801 --> 16:54.367
it's as good
as instantly frozen.

16:54.369 --> 16:56.035
Guys, we got to
go find her.

16:56.037 --> 16:57.436
Shut up!
Don't tell me to shut up!

16:57.438 --> 16:59.838
She's lost!
Just be quiet and listen!

17:01.508 --> 17:04.108
HAPPY:
Toby!

17:04.110 --> 17:06.210
Toby!
That's Happy!

17:06.212 --> 17:07.277
What direction is
that coming from?

17:07.279 --> 17:08.811
WALTER:
Between the winds

17:08.813 --> 17:09.978
and the rock formation,

17:09.980 --> 17:11.145
you get distorted echolocation.

17:11.147 --> 17:12.546
It makes
pinpointing her impossible.

17:12.548 --> 17:14.147
Then we have to find her.

17:14.149 --> 17:16.282
We will, but the clock
is ticking on those soldiers.

17:16.284 --> 17:18.150
Now, we can still go after Happy

17:18.152 --> 17:19.501
when we're through.

17:19.502 --> 17:20.851
I will not let my friend die.

17:20.854 --> 17:22.019
Believe me, Toby.

17:22.021 --> 17:23.787
Neither will I.
What are you doing?

17:23.789 --> 17:26.022
She's your friend;
she's the love of my life.

17:26.024 --> 17:26.956
CABE:
I get it, Doc,

17:26.958 --> 17:28.157
but another missing person

17:28.159 --> 17:30.025
isn't gonna help us.

17:30.027 --> 17:30.992
You could both freeze to death!

17:30.994 --> 17:32.510
When humans sense danger,

17:32.511 --> 17:34.027
they instinctively run
towards the sun.

17:34.030 --> 17:35.863
I'll head
towards the low horizon

17:35.865 --> 17:37.097
and catch up to her.

17:37.099 --> 17:38.198
It's -40!

17:38.200 --> 17:39.499
Oh, really? I hadn't noticed.

17:39.501 --> 17:41.334
This is crazy, Toby.
Damn it, Walter!

17:41.336 --> 17:43.269
If Paige was out there,
would you go back to the hut?

17:47.541 --> 17:49.240
Be careful.

18:01.520 --> 18:04.320
Based on temperature,
Happy's weight,

18:04.322 --> 18:06.388
the insulation rating
of her gear

18:06.390 --> 18:08.189
and estimated thermal loss,

18:08.191 --> 18:10.391
she has 41 minutes
before she freezes to death.

18:10.393 --> 18:13.093
Toby has a little bit longer,
because he's bigger.

18:13.095 --> 18:15.395
This is bad, real bad.

18:15.397 --> 18:17.397
I'm getting Cooper
on the phone.

18:22.370 --> 18:24.403
Happy!

18:25.339 --> 18:27.405
Happy!

18:28.875 --> 18:30.441
I can't see anything.

18:30.443 --> 18:33.310
I have no idea where she is
or where I am.

18:33.312 --> 18:36.079
Toby, I promise,

18:36.081 --> 18:38.114
once we fix the antenna,

18:38.116 --> 18:40.182
save the soldiers,

18:40.184 --> 18:43.251
we'll figure out a way to get
a rescue party back to you.

18:43.253 --> 18:45.152
What do you mean,
"no rescue party"?

18:45.154 --> 18:46.386
You're Homeland. Do something.

18:46.388 --> 18:48.254
I don't care about
the weather.

18:48.256 --> 18:49.521
If you can send
them in there,

18:49.523 --> 18:51.222
you sure as hell
can pull them out.

18:51.224 --> 18:53.357
You know it's not her fault.

18:53.359 --> 18:56.059

to the watch trick, Ralph.

19:07.201 --> 19:08.867
I know severe stress
when I see it.

Special Forces or not,

19:12.054 --> 19:13.470
Captain Decker,
your file says you're 28.

19:13.473 --> 19:15.239
So you were 18 in 2005.

19:15.241 --> 19:16.573
Guess so.

19:16.575 --> 19:18.942
My mom likes songs
from when she was a teenager.

19:18.944 --> 19:20.276
I'll send you one from 2005.

19:20.278 --> 19:21.944
By the time it's over,
you'll be three minutes

19:21.946 --> 19:24.313

to being saved.

We're taking heavy fire.

21:29.018 --> 21:30.851

27:24.335 --> 27:25.801
and I am talking to you

27:25.803 --> 27:28.737
because activity will help
keep both of us warm--

27:28.739 --> 27:30.905
me by working my jaw,

27:30.907 --> 27:33.274
and you by working
your brain.

27:33.276 --> 27:35.608
Come on.

27:38.846 --> 27:40.912
I know I've called you
cold and unfeeling,

27:40.914 --> 27:42.413
but this is ridiculous.

27:42.415 --> 27:44.748
But your heart is still warm,

27:44.750 --> 27:46.683
and you'll stay okay as long
as we can keep it warm.

27:51.523 --> 27:54.524
Okay, um...

27:54.526 --> 27:57.860
I would like to apologize
for what's about to happen.

27:57.862 --> 27:59.294
We need to get naked.

27:59.296 --> 28:00.762
It's not the way I'd imagined,

28:00.764 --> 28:02.797
but bottom line is,
I'm warmer than you,

28:02.799 --> 28:04.799
and skin-to-skin contact
is the fastest way

28:04.801 --> 28:06.934

heat I have over to you.

28:06.936 --> 28:09.536

So here, okay,

28:12.874 --> 28:14.740

28:14.742 --> 28:16.640

28:22.014 --> 28:24.547

28:29.453 --> 28:30.852
Hey, Ralph.

28:32.555 --> 28:34.021
I'm gonna turn my camera
off now, buddy.

28:34.023 --> 28:35.022
No.

28:35.024 --> 28:36.556

28:36.558 --> 28:39.175
Scorpion doesn't fail.

28:39.176 --> 28:41.793

28:46.066 --> 28:49.867
Thanks for keeping me
company, buddy.

28:56.574 --> 29:00.042
Sly, I have the drone
software linked back up,

29:00.044 --> 29:02.044
now please tell Cooper
to advise the Pentagon

29:02.046 --> 29:03.712
they have control of the drones.

29:03.714 --> 29:05.847
SYLVESTER:
I just messaged her,

29:05.848 --> 29:07.981
but the odds of the drones
making it there in time...

29:09.118 --> 29:11.418
Walter, we need to focus
on Toby and Happy.

29:11.420 --> 29:12.752
Now, Cooper has a chopper ready,

29:12.754 --> 29:14.587
but we need to give
them a location.

29:14.589 --> 29:16.055
There's no way to know
where they are,

29:16.057 --> 29:17.923
and we can't track them
in this storm

29:17.925 --> 29:19.624
since we lost contact with Toby.

29:20.927 --> 29:22.260
I learned in Forestry Braves

29:22.261 --> 29:23.594
that snakes hear
with their bellies.

29:23.596 --> 29:25.896
They feel the vibrations
in the earth.

29:25.898 --> 29:27.998
And you're on ice.

29:28.000 --> 29:31.001
Ice conducts sound three times
faster than water

29:31.003 --> 29:32.669
and 15 times faster than air,

29:32.671 --> 29:34.470
so maybe they could hear them
through the ice.

29:34.472 --> 29:36.939
Just need to, uh, build a...
a listening device then.

29:38.108 --> 29:42.643
The sonography machine that
they use to test ice samples.

29:42.645 --> 29:46.113
The electrodes on this
machine emit ultrasound waves

29:46.115 --> 29:48.882
that help scientists
see through the ice.

29:48.884 --> 29:51.618
But Happy and Toby aren't
under the ice, they're on it.

29:51.620 --> 29:53.620
Yeah, but if I can reverse
the generators,

29:53.622 --> 29:55.955
I can use the electrodes
to pick up the sound waves

29:55.957 --> 29:57.489
and to hear through the ice.

29:57.491 --> 29:59.090
Footsteps and yells
and any human sound

29:59.092 --> 30:00.624
would have to be Happy and Toby

30:00.626 --> 30:02.810
'cause they're the only
people around here.

30:02.811 --> 30:04.995
Precisely, so we need to get
as close to them as possible.

30:04.997 --> 30:06.396
(grunts)
All right.

30:08.666 --> 30:11.133
