01:08.375 --> 01:10.875
Wow, Hissy's cat toy
is so much fun,

01:10.875 --> 01:12.250
it makes me wish
I was a cat.

01:12.250 --> 01:14.000
It really is
a good toy, Hissy.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.291
Oh, I know.
Not that I play with it
or anything.

01:17.291 --> 01:18.208
Heh!

01:18.208 --> 01:20.458
Right here, yes!

01:20.458 --> 01:25.458
Ha-ha!
It fits! I'm almost done
with my leopard jigsaw puzzle!

01:25.458 --> 01:29.291
Bob's probably the best
puzzle-putter-together
I know.

01:29.291 --> 01:31.083
I wish I knew how he does it.

01:31.083 --> 01:33.416
Oh. Bob uses the picture
on the puzzle box

01:33.416 --> 01:35.166
to help show him
how to put it together.

01:35.166 --> 01:37.583
That's a strange-looking
spotty kitty.

01:37.583 --> 01:41.291
It's a leopard.
They're big cats
with spots on their fur.

01:41.291 --> 01:43.875
Huh, I can't wait
to finish this puzzle.

01:43.875 --> 01:45.583
Oh, it's gonna be a beauty.

01:45.583 --> 01:47.125
Ooh!

01:47.125 --> 01:49.625
Ooh.
Excuse ARF, Rolly.

01:49.625 --> 01:52.833
ARF must finish
vacuuming up all this
leftover kibble.

01:52.833 --> 01:54.833
No problem, ARF.

01:56.250 --> 01:58.500
Oh, no, ARF!
Don't vacuum that.

01:58.500 --> 02:01.500
Huh-- Turn the vacuum off.

02:01.500 --> 02:02.708
(tear)

02:02.708 --> 02:04.083
Bingo and Rolly:
Oh, no!

02:04.083 --> 02:06.291
Quick, ARF, spit
the picture back out!

02:08.250 --> 02:09.583
(boom)

02:11.875 --> 02:14.708
Oh, no.
How will I ever
finish the puzzle

02:14.708 --> 02:17.458
without the picture
of the leopard to help?

02:17.458 --> 02:20.416
And look at that, oh,
it's time for work.

02:20.416 --> 02:25.000
I was really looking forward
to framing this puzzle
and hanging it up in my kitchen.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
I don't know
what I'm gonna do now.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.166
Well, I'll see you pups
when I get home.

02:30.166 --> 02:33.250
ARF feels bad
for ruining your puzzle box.

02:33.250 --> 02:35.375
And I feel bad
that Bob is sad.

02:35.375 --> 02:39.958
I wish there was some way
he could finish the puzzle
he worked so hard on.

02:39.958 --> 02:41.458
There is a way!

02:41.458 --> 02:44.708
Bob said he needed
a leopard to look at
so he could finish it.

02:44.708 --> 02:47.416
So all we need to do
is find him a new leopard.

02:47.416 --> 02:49.208
Easy, we just go to the--

02:49.208 --> 02:50.583
Where to leopards live?

02:50.583 --> 02:53.708
Oh! Leopards live
on the other side of the world

02:53.708 --> 02:55.833
in grasslands and forests.

02:55.833 --> 02:59.708
We have a new mission:
Find a leopard for Bob,
so he can finish his puzzle.

02:59.708 --> 03:04.250
ARF must warn you.
Leopards are big cats,
and they can be hard to find.

03:04.250 --> 03:08.000
They like to be alone
and sometimes hide in trees.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.333
Hey, Hissy, do you know anyone
who's an expert on cats?

03:11.333 --> 03:15.291
Well, I'm a cat,
and I do like to be alone

03:15.291 --> 03:17.000
and hide in high places.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.416
And you're a cat!
Like you just said.

03:19.416 --> 03:22.583
Help us, Hissy!
You're our only hope!

03:22.583 --> 03:23.875
I don't know.

03:23.875 --> 03:25.208
Pretty please?

03:25.208 --> 03:27.500
Oh please, oh please,
oh please?

03:27.500 --> 03:31.958
Oh, okay.
Since you said, "Oh please,
oh please, oh please."

03:31.958 --> 03:34.083
Puppies:
Woo-hoo! Yeah!
Let's go!

03:36.875 --> 03:38.708

04:14.375 --> 04:17.583
Wow! This place is huge!

04:17.583 --> 04:19.458
(sighs) And hot!

04:19.458 --> 04:20.875
Really hot!

04:20.875 --> 04:22.000
And huge!

04:22.000 --> 04:23.708
You just said that,
didn't you?

04:23.708 --> 04:25.708
So, how do we find
a leopard, Hissy?

04:25.708 --> 04:29.708
Well, leopards
are big animals
covered in spots, so we--

04:29.708 --> 04:32.958
(gasps) I see one!
It's really tall
and covered in spots!

04:34.000 --> 04:36.375
Wait!
Those aren't leopards!
They're--

04:36.375 --> 04:37.875
Why do I bother?

04:37.875 --> 04:40.291
I never knew
leopards ate leaves.

04:40.291 --> 04:41.583
Very interesting.

04:41.583 --> 04:45.416
(out of breath)
Rolly, this is a giraffe.

04:45.416 --> 04:47.125
Not a leopard.

04:47.125 --> 04:50.500
(swallows) Oh, my!
You startled me!

04:50.500 --> 04:52.458
Howdy down there, puppies!

04:52.458 --> 04:54.958
I'm Barry.
Barry the giraffe.

04:54.958 --> 04:56.708
Pleased to make
your acquaintance.

04:56.708 --> 04:58.625
I'm Bingo.
Bingo the puppy.

04:58.625 --> 05:01.125
Pleased to
be your acquaintance.

05:01.125 --> 05:03.000
So, you're not a leopard?

05:03.000 --> 05:04.166
You're a giraffe?

05:04.166 --> 05:06.250
-Yeah.
-Since Barry's not a leopard,

05:06.250 --> 05:08.375
I'm gonna climb that tree
and see if I can get
a better view

05:08.375 --> 05:10.291
to search for one.

05:11.291 --> 05:13.208
(splat)

05:13.208 --> 05:16.458
-I can't move!
-Oh my! Y-- You're stuck
to the sap!

05:16.458 --> 05:18.416
-What's sap?
-Not much, what's sap
with you?

05:18.416 --> 05:20.458
(both laugh)

05:20.458 --> 05:22.458
Ooh! Sorry!
I-- I'll help ya down there.

05:22.458 --> 05:24.583
Whoa! Ooh!

05:24.583 --> 05:27.458
We just got here,
and already you're a mess.

05:27.458 --> 05:29.833
Thank you.
That's the way I like it.

05:29.833 --> 05:32.500
Since you're not a leopard,
we need to get back

05:32.500 --> 05:34.458
to our leopard-finding mission
for Bob.

05:34.458 --> 05:37.333
But, this grass is too high.

05:37.333 --> 05:38.750
We can't see!

05:38.750 --> 05:40.000
Well, I can help with that.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.333
-Hop on!
-Woo-hoo!
Come on, Hissy!

05:42.333 --> 05:45.583
Yeah! We need your
cat skills to help us
spot a cat!

05:45.583 --> 05:47.375
Oh, okay.

05:47.375 --> 05:48.500
Going up!

05:48.500 --> 05:50.875
Bingo, Rolly and Hissy:
Whoa!

05:50.875 --> 05:53.166
Oh! Look over there!

05:53.166 --> 05:55.458
It looks like a watering hole.

05:55.458 --> 05:56.833
Rolly:
Cool.

05:56.833 --> 05:59.416
If I were a leopard,
I would go there, too.

05:59.416 --> 06:01.500
That's what cats do
when it gets hot, like today:

06:01.500 --> 06:03.583
They drink water
to cool down.

06:03.583 --> 06:06.500
If that's where a leopard
is going to be, then we
should be there, too.

06:06.500 --> 06:08.375
-Ground floor, please.
-Cafeteria, please.

06:08.375 --> 06:11.583
-There's no cafeteria, Rolly.
-It doesn't hurt to try.

06:11.583 --> 06:14.000
I'm pretty hungry from traveling
halfway around the world.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.083
-Thanks, Barry the giraffe!
-Yeah! Thanks, Barry!

06:17.083 --> 06:20.625
-Enjoy your tree leaves!
-Good luck, you three!

06:23.416 --> 06:26.583
(emphatically)
Bow to the wow!

06:26.583 --> 06:30.583
Look at all this mud!
This might be the best
swimming pool ever!

06:30.583 --> 06:33.458
Oh, I'm gonna play
in that mud like I've
never played before!

06:33.458 --> 06:37.625
I'm gonna get muddy!
Muddy! Muddy!

06:37.625 --> 06:39.416
Muddy! Muddy!

06:39.416 --> 06:43.083
How do you get
any of your missions done?

06:43.083 --> 06:47.375
Uh, excuse me?
Have you by any chance
seen a leopard around here?

06:47.375 --> 06:50.583
You know,
the kind you find
on a jigsaw puzzle box?

06:50.583 --> 06:54.166
Why, of course!
You're sitting in one
of his paw prints!

06:54.166 --> 06:57.125
Whoa! Is that a paw print?

06:57.125 --> 06:58.458
Indeed it is!

06:58.458 --> 07:00.708
Leopards are quite big cats!

07:00.708 --> 07:02.708
Do you know where
the leopard is now?

07:02.708 --> 07:06.583
Well, like all leopards,
this fellow is a pretty hard cat
to find.

07:06.583 --> 07:09.958
His spots help him
blend into the trees
where he lives.

07:09.958 --> 07:13.583
If you wanna find a leopard,
just follow his paw prints.
(giggles)

07:16.583 --> 07:18.375
Thanks! Come on!

07:18.375 --> 07:20.625
Let's follow those paw prints
and find that leopard,

07:20.625 --> 07:22.458
so Bob can finish his puzzle.

07:22.458 --> 07:23.500
Wait for me!

07:23.500 --> 07:24.708
Rarrrrr!

07:29.708 --> 07:31.291
Ssh! I see him!

07:31.291 --> 07:33.458
He's right over there
standing in the bushes.

07:33.458 --> 07:34.875
He doesn't see us.

07:34.875 --> 07:36.583
I don't see him!

07:36.583 --> 07:38.875
That's because his spots
help him blend in.

07:38.875 --> 07:40.416
It makes him hard to see.

07:40.416 --> 07:41.750
(growling noise)

07:41.750 --> 07:43.208
Rolly, quiet!

07:43.208 --> 07:44.833
Excuse me.
That's my stomach.

07:44.833 --> 07:46.458
I told you I was hungry.

07:46.458 --> 07:48.416
(Hissy sighs)
He's gone!

07:49.583 --> 07:53.500
Aha! Of course!
Follow me.

07:53.500 --> 07:56.208
(puppies barking)

07:56.208 --> 07:58.583
-Quietly.
-Sorry!

Hmm, this is definitely
leopard hair.

08:52.583 --> 08:55.000
Yep, this must be
where he sleeps.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.958
So now that we've found
where he lives...

08:56.958 --> 08:58.708
where is he?

08:58.708 --> 09:00.458
He must have heard us,

09:00.458 --> 09:03.375
so we wait quietly
for him to come back,

09:03.375 --> 09:05.000
then we try to talk with him.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.708
I'm just gonna have
a little snack while we wait.

09:09.500 --> 09:12.416
Hey! My favorite cat toy!
How did that get here?

09:12.416 --> 09:13.583
I forgot.

09:13.583 --> 09:16.000
I brought it in case
I felt the urge
to play with it.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.875
Well, I know someone
who has the urge to play
with it.

09:18.875 --> 09:21.000
(low growling)

09:26.458 --> 09:27.750
(squeak)

09:27.750 --> 09:30.083
(chuckling)

09:30.083 --> 09:33.250
I just love funny noises!

09:33.250 --> 09:36.208
I don't--
I don't even know why.
I-- I just do.

09:36.208 --> 09:37.958
(laughs)

09:37.958 --> 09:41.625
(laughs)
The toy does make
a pretty funny noise, right?

09:41.625 --> 09:43.208
Oh-- Oh!
If you squeeze it down lower,

09:43.208 --> 09:44.375
it sounds even funnier!

09:44.375 --> 09:46.000
-(squeaks lower)
-(laughing)

09:46.958 --> 09:49.416
-(squeaking)
-(laughing)

09:52.416 --> 09:55.000

These giggling kitties

09:55.000 --> 09:57.083
are making me wanna
giggle, too!

09:57.083 --> 09:59.166
Excuse me.
Mr. Leopard?

09:59.166 --> 10:02.208
(chuckling)
Please, call me Titus.

10:02.208 --> 10:05.333
Well, Mr. Titus.
We're on a mission to bring
a leopard back

10:05.333 --> 10:06.625
to our owner Bob's house,

10:06.625 --> 10:08.750
so he can look at it
and finish the puzzle

10:08.750 --> 10:09.875
he's worked so hard on.

10:09.875 --> 10:12.708
Sorry, puppies,
but this is my home.

10:12.708 --> 10:14.958
Please, Titus?

10:14.958 --> 10:16.583
We really need a leopard.

10:16.583 --> 10:18.583
Right, Rolly? Rolly?

10:18.583 --> 10:20.250
I'm right here, Bingo.

10:20.250 --> 10:22.166
I got stuck again.

10:23.750 --> 10:25.166
I'm good!

10:25.166 --> 10:27.708
(giggling)
You don't need me.

10:27.708 --> 10:30.833
You've got your own
little leopard right here.

10:30.833 --> 10:32.125
Look at his fur.

10:32.125 --> 10:34.958
It's so stained
that he almost looks
like a leopard cub!

10:36.125 --> 10:39.708
Me? A leopard?
Cool! Rarrr!

10:39.708 --> 10:42.583
Rolly!
You do look like a leopard!

10:42.583 --> 10:45.875
Bob can look at you,
so he can finish his puzzle!

10:45.875 --> 10:49.208
Well, that's one way
to complete this mission...
I guess.

10:49.208 --> 10:53.000
Come on, guys!
We gotta get back home
so Bob and finish his puzzle!

10:55.166 --> 10:58.458
(hesitantly)
Oh! Um-- uh, would you mind

10:58.458 --> 11:00.500
if I maybe...

11:00.500 --> 11:02.708
kept your squeaky toy?

11:02.708 --> 11:04.625
Of course not.
And thank you

11:04.625 --> 11:06.458
for helping us out
on our mission.

11:07.583 --> 11:09.333
-(laughing)
-(toy squeaks)

11:09.333 --> 11:12.583
Oh, thank you!
Thank you!

11:16.500 --> 11:20.375
Yes! Ha-ha!
That's the last piece
of the puzzle!

11:20.375 --> 11:25.083
I did it!
And it's all thanks to you!

11:25.083 --> 11:28.458
I don't know
how you got so sticky
in the back yard today,

11:28.458 --> 11:30.458
but thank goodness you did!

11:30.458 --> 11:34.958
Because you look just like
a little spotted leopard!

11:34.958 --> 11:37.000
Ha-ha!
Well, now that I'm done,

11:37.000 --> 11:39.166
I better give you two a bath.

11:39.166 --> 11:40.958
I'll go get the water started.

11:40.958 --> 11:42.833
Oh! I almost forgot!

11:42.833 --> 11:45.708
I saw you playing
with Hissy's squeaky toy
this morning

11:45.708 --> 11:46.833
and got you two something.

11:46.833 --> 11:50.166
-Your own squeaky toy!
-(toy squeaking)

11:52.875 --> 11:54.750
-(toy squeaks)
-ARF, come help me
get the bath going.

11:54.750 --> 11:58.333
-ARF loves to help.
-(squeaking)

11:58.333 --> 12:01.375
-(snap)
-Hey, Hissy, I know Bob
gave this to us,

12:01.375 --> 12:03.125
but since you left
your toy with Titus,

12:03.125 --> 12:04.875
maybe we can share it?

12:04.875 --> 12:07.875
-(squeak)
-I don't know, guys.

12:07.875 --> 12:10.208
I'm doing just--
Okay, yeah!

12:10.208 --> 12:11.833
I was kinda hoping
you'd share!

12:11.833 --> 12:12.708
Thanks, guys!

12:12.708 --> 12:14.166
(all giggling)

12:14.166 --> 12:15.458
Rarrr!

12:15.458 --> 12:17.833
(all giggling)

12:20.875 --> 12:22.708
(Bingo and Rolly speak)

12:22.708 --> 12:26.375
(classical music playing)

12:33.250 --> 12:35.375
When's Bob gonna
throw that stick already?

12:35.375 --> 12:36.958
Yeah!
What's he waiting for?

12:36.958 --> 12:39.958
He's never going
to throw the stick, guys.

12:39.958 --> 12:42.708
Why else would he
wave it around unless
he's getting ready to throw it?

12:42.708 --> 12:46.708
Bob's using the stick
to pretend like he's
an orchestra conductor.

12:46.708 --> 12:49.000
Oh. That's the person
who tells the musicians

12:49.000 --> 12:51.958
how fast or slow to play.
Like that lady.

12:51.958 --> 12:55.833
The stick she's holding
looks like another good stick
to play catch with.

12:55.833 --> 12:57.458
That's called a baton.

12:57.458 --> 13:00.708
Ho-ho! The end is coming
and it's my favorite part!

13:00.708 --> 13:03.250
The big gong finale!

13:03.250 --> 13:06.708
(music swells)

13:15.750 --> 13:19.000
(gong sounds)

13:19.000 --> 13:20.875
-(puppies barking)
-Ha-ah, whoa!

13:20.875 --> 13:23.250
I got a little carried away,
didn't I?

13:23.250 --> 13:25.708
Well, that's just because
I'm so excited

13:25.708 --> 13:29.000
to take you guys to the concert
in the park tomorrow.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.583
They're gonna play this song
at the end!

13:31.583 --> 13:35.291
♪ We're goin' to a concert. ♪
High paw!

13:38.291 --> 13:42.208
I can't wait to enjoy
my favorite concert
with my pups!

13:44.958 --> 13:47.291
Oops!
I hope you weren't saving these.

13:47.291 --> 13:50.708
-(barks)
-Ha-ha-heh! Good thing
they sell doggie treats

13:50.708 --> 13:54.000
at that snack bar.
And since there's a fence
around this area,

13:54.000 --> 13:56.875
you can play
with the other dogs
while I keep an eye on you!

13:56.875 --> 13:59.083
-(puppies barking)
-I'll be back.

13:59.083 --> 14:01.083
Park exploring, here we come!

14:01.083 --> 14:04.125
-(dogs panting)
-Woman: One, two, three.
One, two, three.

14:04.125 --> 14:07.500
-One, two, three.
-What you doin', Dallie?

14:07.500 --> 14:11.125
Watchin' that lady.
She's about to throw that stick.

14:11.125 --> 14:14.875
So for the concert,
I need my baton,
and these music sheets

14:14.875 --> 14:17.750
to lead the musicians,
so they'll know what to play.

14:17.750 --> 14:21.875
And of course, the gong,
for the big gong finale
at the end.

14:21.875 --> 14:24.250
One, two, three.
One, two, three.

14:24.250 --> 14:27.000
Hate to break it to you,
but she's never gonna
throw that stick.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.708
I came over here
for that stick,

14:29.708 --> 14:31.583
and if she's not going
to throw it,

14:31.583 --> 14:34.083
then I'm gonna find a way
to take it!

14:34.083 --> 14:36.416
Rufus! Get that stick!

14:36.416 --> 14:38.000
Ruff!

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
Rowf!

14:40.000 --> 14:43.375
Oh! Come back here!
I need that for the concert!

14:43.375 --> 14:46.958
(dogs barking)

14:48.708 --> 14:51.125
-Ah-ohh!
-(giggling)

14:51.125 --> 14:54.625
-(dogs barking)
-Rufus! You're supposed
to give it to me!

14:54.625 --> 14:58.000
I can't lead the concert
without my special baton!

14:58.000 --> 15:01.333
Did you hear that?
If the conductor can't lead
the musicians

15:01.333 --> 15:04.458
without her baton,
then there won't be any concert!

15:04.458 --> 15:07.000
And-- And then Bob
will be so sad!

15:07.000 --> 15:09.166
I'm sad just thinking
about it.

15:09.166 --> 15:12.708
We don't need
to be sad, Rolly.
We need to be on a mission.

15:12.708 --> 15:16.083
A mission to make sure
this concert happens,
for Bob!

15:16.083 --> 15:19.333
And that means we need to...
chase that stick!

15:20.333 --> 15:24.208
(barking)

15:26.375 --> 15:28.583
Stop!
In the name of the paws!

15:28.583 --> 15:31.125
Unmouth that baton,
you baton-taker!

15:31.125 --> 15:32.000
(gasps)

15:32.000 --> 15:33.250
Uh-uh!

15:33.250 --> 15:35.416
Bingo and Rolly:
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!

15:35.416 --> 15:38.000
(dogs barking)

15:40.000 --> 15:42.208
Man, we'll never
catch those guys.

15:42.208 --> 15:45.083
Yeah, we're gonna need
some help.

15:46.166 --> 15:47.458
Strider! Come with us!

15:47.458 --> 15:49.000
Hey, Bingo!
Hey, Rolly!

15:49.000 --> 15:50.250
What you doin'?

15:50.250 --> 15:52.125
You see those dogs over there?

15:52.125 --> 15:53.958
(dogs barking)

15:53.958 --> 15:55.000
I see 'em.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.958
We're trying to get
that baton stick thingy

15:56.958 --> 15:58.125
back to the conductor

15:58.125 --> 16:00.000
so the concert
won't be canceled!

16:00.000 --> 16:02.625
Canceled?
No, no, no!

16:02.625 --> 16:04.583
We gotta get that baton!

16:04.583 --> 16:07.458
Slow them down
and we can get
the baton back!

16:07.458 --> 16:09.708
Herding is what I do best!

16:09.708 --> 16:12.583
-(barking)
-Hey, doggies, doggies, doggies!

16:12.583 --> 16:15.375
Slow it down!
Slow it down!

16:15.375 --> 16:16.958
Hmm?

16:16.958 --> 16:19.125
Mmph!

16:19.125 --> 16:20.083
(screeching sound)

16:20.083 --> 16:21.208
(crash)

16:21.208 --> 16:22.458
(groan)

16:22.458 --> 16:24.208
Ah, that didn't go
how I pictured it
in my mind.

16:24.208 --> 16:25.625
Everyone okay?

16:25.625 --> 16:27.958
Yeah, man.
That was fun!

16:27.958 --> 16:29.000
Where's the stick?

16:29.000 --> 16:30.125
Uh-- Uh, I mean baton?

16:30.125 --> 16:32.583
Oh, thank goodness!

16:32.583 --> 16:33.833
Here's my baton!

16:33.833 --> 16:35.125
Silly doggy!

16:35.125 --> 16:37.125
I need to go backstage
to get ready.

16:37.125 --> 16:38.875
The concert's
starting soon.

16:38.875 --> 16:42.000
We did it, Rolly!
We saved Bob's concert!

16:42.000 --> 16:43.583
Was there ever any doubt?

16:43.583 --> 16:45.875
We're just in time,
and I'm playing the gong.

16:45.875 --> 16:48.583
So it's a good thing
we have sheet music
and notes to play

16:48.583 --> 16:50.000
for the concert, Frank.

16:50.000 --> 16:53.208
Sure is.
Let's put our stuff onstage
and go grab a snack.

16:56.875 --> 17:00.291
-(papers rustling)
-Oh, no! The sheet music!

17:00.291 --> 17:02.375
Come on, Rolly!

17:02.375 --> 17:06.458
This is messier than Bob's
living room after we've had
a tail-chasing contest.

17:06.458 --> 17:10.416
If we don't get all of these
sheets back, there won't be
any music to read!

17:10.416 --> 17:13.708
And no music means
no concert for Bob!

17:13.708 --> 17:16.125
Double Pup Power

how a doggie does that!

I think we got
all the pieces

Got you, paper!

18:16.875 --> 18:18.583
Oh, no!
Oh, no!

18:20.500 --> 18:24.166
That's the big gong
for the big gong finale
at the end of the concert!

18:24.166 --> 18:25.125
Bob's favorite part!

18:25.125 --> 18:27.166
If there's no gong for the song,

18:27.166 --> 18:29.583
it's so long
for Bob's gong song!

18:29.583 --> 18:33.250
-That's means...

-Hey, Cagey!
-Hi, guys!

18:52.333 --> 18:54.458
Hey, did you see a gong?

18:54.458 --> 18:55.708
Round?
Gold colored?

18:55.708 --> 18:57.333
Made a gong-ish kinda noise?

18:57.333 --> 18:58.583
That's the one!

18:58.583 --> 18:59.875
It went that-a-way!

18:59.875 --> 19:01.875
Then we're going that-a-way too!

19:04.708 --> 19:05.875
(gasps)

19:08.250 --> 19:11.208
Ooh, it's stopping!
That was one good chase,
wasn't it?

19:11.208 --> 19:14.333
Except now, the gong
is chasing after us!

19:14.333 --> 19:15.625
Watch out!

19:15.625 --> 19:18.583
This is one rolly gong!
Ha-ha!

19:18.583 --> 19:20.500
I said my name!
(giggles)

19:21.875 --> 19:24.083
(puppies scream)

19:24.083 --> 19:25.583
Did you catch the gong?

19:25.583 --> 19:27.708
Rolly:
Sort of!

19:27.708 --> 19:28.708
Whoa!

19:31.375 --> 19:34.083
Hey!
There's the stage again!

19:34.083 --> 19:36.458
-(bang)
-I guess that gong
wants to go back to its home!

19:36.458 --> 19:38.500
We gotta get this gong
to stop chasing us

19:38.500 --> 19:40.708
and go back onstage!

19:40.708 --> 19:42.208
I have an idea!

19:43.708 --> 19:45.250
Help me out, Rolly!

19:52.625 --> 19:54.750
Gong's away!

19:54.750 --> 19:56.458
(gong sounds)

19:56.458 --> 19:58.875
Bow to the wow wow wow!
We did it!

19:58.875 --> 20:00.625
We got the gong
back to the stage,

20:00.625 --> 20:02.583
so now Bob's concert
is saved!

20:02.583 --> 20:04.000
Again!

20:04.000 --> 20:06.416
We're pretty good
at this whole saving thing,
you know.

20:06.416 --> 20:07.833
Oh, I know.

20:07.833 --> 20:11.708
So exciting, Frank!
The concert is about to start!

20:11.708 --> 20:15.125
The start is favorite part,
other than the finale.

20:15.125 --> 20:16.708
And the parts in the middle.

20:16.708 --> 20:19.583
Did you hear that, Rolly?
The concert is about to begin!

20:19.583 --> 20:22.458
We need to get back to Bob
or he'll wonder
where we've gong--

20:22.458 --> 20:26.083
-Uh, gone!
-Yeah, he needs to listen
to his favorite music

20:26.083 --> 20:28.375
with his two favorite gongs--
uh, I mean puppies.

20:28.375 --> 20:30.708
Musician:
All right, everyone ready
to tune up and play?

20:33.875 --> 20:35.875
Hey, Bob!
We saved the concert!

20:35.875 --> 20:37.500
Yeah, we know how much
you love--

20:37.500 --> 20:40.000
(dogs barking)

20:40.000 --> 20:42.833
Hey, fellas!
I hope you two had a fun time

20:42.833 --> 20:44.833
exploring and playing
with the other doggies!

20:44.833 --> 20:48.375
Ha-ha!
I got you your favorite
dog treats!

20:48.375 --> 20:49.708
-(classical music playing)
-(gasps) Oh boy!

20:49.708 --> 20:52.708
The concert
is about to start!

20:52.708 --> 20:55.208
(puppies barking)

(music continues)

21:12.291 --> 21:14.416
(applause and cheering)

21:14.416 --> 21:18.458
And now,
for the last song of the night,
as a special treat,

21:18.458 --> 21:20.708
I'd like someone
from the audience

21:20.708 --> 21:22.333
to help me
conduct the orchestra

21:22.333 --> 21:25.708
for the famous
big gong finale!

21:25.708 --> 21:27.500
Would anyone like to volunteer?

21:27.500 --> 21:31.458
-You gotta volunteer, Bob!
-Yeah, you gotta conduct
the big gong finale!

21:31.458 --> 21:35.291
-(dogs barking)
-Wow there, fellas, ha-ha!
You sure are excited

21:35.291 --> 21:37.291
for the big gong finale!

21:37.291 --> 21:40.708
Uh-oh, you want
this doggie treat, don't you?

21:42.416 --> 21:46.083
Oh! You, sir!
The one waving frantically!

21:46.083 --> 21:47.708
Bob:
Who? Me?

21:47.708 --> 21:49.166
Yes! You!

21:49.166 --> 21:52.333
Oh-ho, woo!
You two stay here!

21:52.333 --> 21:54.083
I'm going to conduct!

21:54.083 --> 21:56.125
Ha-ha!

21:56.125 --> 22:00.375
(classical music playing)

22:00.375 --> 22:02.000
Bob is doing great!

22:02.000 --> 22:03.416
This is just like at home!

22:03.416 --> 22:04.833
Only better!

22:04.833 --> 22:07.416
And the big gong finale
is just about to happen!

22:09.458 --> 22:13.875
(music continues)

22:16.000 --> 22:19.250
Pay attention, honey!
Watch his baton!

22:19.250 --> 22:20.958
He'll tell you when to play!

22:20.958 --> 22:23.166

22:39.458 --> 22:42.125
(gong sounding)

22:42.125 --> 22:44.458
(applause and cheering)

22:44.458 --> 22:47.166
-Go, Bob!
-That was pup-tastic!

22:47.166 --> 22:50.000
-Whoops! Whoa!
-Huh?

22:50.000 --> 22:51.166
-Ohh?
-Woo!

22:51.166 --> 22:52.708
Rolly? Do you see
what I see?

22:52.708 --> 22:54.000
