WEBVTT

00:05.744 --> 00:06.876
- How do you feel?

00:10.793 --> 00:12.490
- Wait.
Wait, no!

00:14.231 --> 00:17.017
- A little dizzy, but
otherwise, I think I'm okay.

00:19.628 --> 00:21.586
- Welcome to the team,
Kamilla.

00:22.544 --> 00:25.155
Your creation was unplanned,

00:25.199 --> 00:28.332
but I know you'll make
a useful addition.

00:28.376 --> 00:29.942
- Where's my counterpart?

00:29.986 --> 00:31.683
- She's no longer
a problem now.

00:31.727 --> 00:34.686
I don't have much time
before Iris realizes I'm gone,

00:34.730 --> 00:36.558
so listen to me,
this is important.

00:36.601 --> 00:38.516
Six years ago,

00:38.560 --> 00:41.693
I created a device capable of
converting light into energy.

00:41.737 --> 00:44.696
I called it
the Prismatic Refractor.

00:44.740 --> 00:46.959
It looked like this.

00:47.003 --> 00:49.962
I need you to retrieve it
for me.

01:00.582 --> 01:02.714
- It's beautiful.
- That's a replica.

01:02.758 --> 01:03.802
I made it here
in the Mirrorverse,

01:03.846 --> 01:05.543
but my R-CEM rejected it,

01:05.587 --> 01:08.068
I believe it needs the
original in order to function.

01:08.111 --> 01:09.982
- What's the R-CEM?

01:10.026 --> 01:12.115
- A thing that will ensure the
success of my long term plans.

01:12.159 --> 01:14.204
- Where do we start?

01:14.248 --> 01:17.599
- My husband, Joseph, he...

01:17.642 --> 01:20.123
underestimated the value
of the Refractor

01:20.167 --> 01:22.256
and sold it to Mercury Labs
a few months ago.

01:23.431 --> 01:26.651
Find a way in, replace the
replica out with the original,

01:26.695 --> 01:27.957
and you bring it to me.

01:29.176 --> 01:31.874
Do not let me down.
- Success is assured.

01:49.805 --> 01:53.113
- I've officially hacked every
Quantum Kinematic database

01:53.156 --> 01:54.810
on the planet.

01:54.853 --> 01:57.117
You know what I found out about
Artificial Speed Forces?

01:57.160 --> 02:01.599
Thawne built one,
and that's it.

02:01.643 --> 02:03.601
And I doubt he's gonna tell us

02:03.645 --> 02:05.255
seeing how he's Linda Blaired
our pal Nash,

02:05.299 --> 02:08.171
and you know, he kinda wants
to murder the hell out of us.

02:08.215 --> 02:10.173
- If Thawne can figure it out,
then so can we.

02:10.217 --> 02:11.870
- In the meantime,

02:11.914 --> 02:13.785
we need to make sure the Flash
doesn't lose his powers.

02:13.829 --> 02:15.483
The Speed Force may be gone,

02:15.526 --> 02:17.137
but there's still a residual
amount of speed left

02:17.180 --> 02:19.704
in your DNA.
- Until we figure out how much,

02:19.748 --> 02:21.489
we need to manage
your speed output.

02:21.532 --> 02:24.970
- How do we do that?
- I call it the Speed Gauge.

02:25.014 --> 02:27.712
- It will measure the intensity
of the velocity you're using

02:27.756 --> 02:30.367
by color.
So, right now, it's black.

02:30.411 --> 02:33.153
That's neutral--means you're
not using any speed at all.

02:33.196 --> 02:34.893
If you're using a minimal
amount, that's green.

02:34.937 --> 02:36.634
The yellow is next,
then orange,

02:36.678 --> 02:40.203
and obviously red
is the maximum amount.

02:40.247 --> 02:41.552
At this point,

02:41.596 --> 02:43.163
I don't recommend
operating beyond green.

02:43.206 --> 02:45.643
And we're not just talking
about running, okay?

02:45.687 --> 02:47.210
Speed thinking--
- Speed healing--

02:47.254 --> 02:48.907
- Flash time.

02:48.951 --> 02:50.692
All of these things could
deplete your meta-abilities.

02:50.735 --> 02:53.303
You have to be careful.
- Guys, it's not that simple.

02:53.347 --> 02:55.218
I'm supposed to keep
the city safe.

02:55.262 --> 02:58.178
- Team Flash!
It's your pal, Nash.

02:58.221 --> 02:59.701
Let me out!

02:59.744 --> 03:02.182
- Guys, are we sure
that's Nash?

03:02.225 --> 03:04.096
- Or Thawne playing possum?

03:04.140 --> 03:06.838
- Let's find out.

03:06.882 --> 03:09.319
- I hear you've got an update
for me

03:09.363 --> 03:11.016
on the Carver RICO
investigation.

03:11.060 --> 03:14.324
- Just sifting through
the paperwork,

03:14.368 --> 03:17.501
I found evidence
of multiple cover-ups.

03:17.545 --> 03:20.504
Homicides being filed
as accidents,

03:20.548 --> 03:25.553
missing person cases buried
by falsified paperwork.

03:25.596 --> 03:29.600
And every victim has
one thing in common.

03:29.644 --> 03:32.255
- You think Carver has a mole
inside CCPD?

03:32.299 --> 03:35.345
- Somebody has been helping him
evade criminal charges.

03:35.389 --> 03:37.129
The question is, why?

03:37.173 --> 03:40.394
- This is, uh,
outstanding work, Joe,

03:40.437 --> 03:42.526
but investigating a mole,

03:42.570 --> 03:45.268
that's--that's a job for
internal affairs, not for us.

03:45.312 --> 03:47.270
We can't trust I.A.

03:47.314 --> 03:49.707
or anybody until we find out
who Carver's bought.

03:49.751 --> 03:52.362
I mean, Barry agrees.

03:52.406 --> 03:54.103
- Hold on,
Flash has seen these files?

03:54.146 --> 03:55.583
- Yeah.

03:55.626 --> 03:57.976
- Joe, this is not
meta-related business.

03:58.020 --> 04:00.631
Is there a chance that
this is becoming personal?

04:00.675 --> 04:02.242
I mean,
I would totally understand

04:02.285 --> 04:03.939
given what Carver's done
to Iris.

04:03.982 --> 04:05.593
- This is still about bringing
a criminal to justice.

04:05.636 --> 04:07.638
- And we will,

04:07.682 --> 04:10.554
but Joe, this is
your first year as captain.

04:10.598 --> 04:12.556
If your people think you
suspect one of them

04:12.600 --> 04:15.255
of being a mole,
and you're wrong...

04:15.298 --> 04:16.995
- Have a look.

04:20.129 --> 04:21.609
- So this Thawne--

04:21.652 --> 04:24.089
got the red eyes
and vibrates,

04:24.133 --> 04:26.918
but he's also a Wells?

04:26.962 --> 04:29.921
- Yeah.
That's him.

04:29.965 --> 04:31.271
How did you--

04:31.314 --> 04:33.316
- I've been seeing a lot
of Wells lately.

04:33.360 --> 04:35.927
I mean,

04:35.971 --> 04:37.755
up here.
A lot.

04:37.799 --> 04:39.322
I don't know
how many there are,

04:39.366 --> 04:40.976
but the wizard Wells, annoying.

04:41.019 --> 04:42.325
French Wells--

04:42.369 --> 04:43.935
New York City Wells--

04:43.979 --> 04:47.461
actually he's all right.
And then Harry Wells.

04:47.504 --> 04:51.595
- Nash, Harry's dead.
They're all dead.

04:51.639 --> 04:53.858
- Hey, guys?
I think you should see this.

04:53.902 --> 04:55.120
- Let's go.

04:55.164 --> 04:57.949
Let--come on.
Let me out!

04:57.993 --> 05:00.865
- So, at first glance, Nash's
brainwaves seem totally normal.

05:00.909 --> 05:03.433
No anomalies
or inconsistencies.

05:03.477 --> 05:06.218
But when I take
a look at them in 3D,

05:06.262 --> 05:08.786
it appears that there
are multiple brainwaves

05:08.830 --> 05:10.788
intricately tangled together.

05:12.486 --> 05:14.357
- When the Multiverse
collapsed in Crisis

05:14.401 --> 05:16.054
all of the Wellses
must have channeled into

05:16.098 --> 05:17.839
the only surviving
doppelganger.

05:17.882 --> 05:20.494
- Multiple psyches camped out
in Nash's brain.

05:20.537 --> 05:22.496
It's like Tyler Durden
times a thousand.

05:22.539 --> 05:23.975
- Tyler Durden.
Great reference.

05:24.019 --> 05:25.673
"First rule of fight club is--"

05:25.716 --> 05:27.457
- Kay, can we not talk
about "Fight Club"?

05:27.501 --> 05:28.980
- Yeah, that's it.

05:29.024 --> 05:30.634
So how many Wells
are we talking about here?

05:30.678 --> 05:31.983
- How many universes were there
in the multiverse?

05:32.027 --> 05:33.507
- What?

05:33.550 --> 05:35.247
- Okay, wait, no,
this doesn't make any sense.

05:35.291 --> 05:36.814
I mean, Thawne wasn't even
a real Wells.

05:36.858 --> 05:38.903
He killed Harrison Wells,
took over his body,

05:38.947 --> 05:40.340
and fooled us for months.

05:40.383 --> 05:41.819
- This is a psychopath
we're talking about

05:41.863 --> 05:43.255
that is trying
to take over my body!

05:43.299 --> 05:45.170
Let's get him out
before he resurfaces!

05:45.214 --> 05:46.737
Come on!

05:46.781 --> 05:48.173
- I mean, there's no medical
procedure or device

05:48.217 --> 05:49.827
that could separate
brainwaves.

05:49.871 --> 05:52.482
- Not on this stupid Earth
there's not, but hello,

05:52.526 --> 05:54.484
Multiversal traveler, anyone?
Right?

05:54.528 --> 05:57.182
I have a neuro-splicer here
in my bag.

05:57.226 --> 05:59.271
Can you--can you get it please?

05:59.315 --> 06:00.664
Will work just fine.

06:00.708 --> 06:02.405
Actually help me out
stop an invasion

06:02.449 --> 06:05.016
of psychic starfish
on Earth 26.

06:05.060 --> 06:06.104
In the little--
yeah, that's it.

06:06.148 --> 06:09.107
That was not pretty,

06:09.151 --> 06:12.067
although, to be honest,
I don't know if the splicer

06:12.110 --> 06:14.374
can separate thousands
of brainwaves all at once.

06:14.417 --> 06:16.550
- It will be
if we supercharge it

06:16.593 --> 06:18.073
with the EMP
from your gauntlet.

06:20.249 --> 06:21.598
- Yes.

06:21.642 --> 06:23.687
Yes, the gauntlet, yes!

06:23.731 --> 06:26.211
Just make sure that
when you charge the EMP

06:26.255 --> 06:27.691
that it's 1,500 volts
per meter,

06:27.735 --> 06:29.519
otherwise, you'll risk--
- I know, I know.

06:29.563 --> 06:31.391
Otherwise, I'll--
both: Fry the circuitry.

06:31.434 --> 06:33.218
I got it.
- Cisco, wait.

06:42.489 --> 06:44.404
- That was Thawne
the whole time?

06:44.447 --> 06:46.057
- He couldn't have gotten far.

06:46.101 --> 06:47.885
He doesn't have his powers,
so he can't time travel.

06:47.929 --> 06:50.540
- Yes he can.

07:00.202 --> 07:03.161
Oh, look at us, Flash.

07:03.205 --> 07:05.076
Two peas in a pod.

07:05.120 --> 07:08.558
Just two speedsters frustrated
by the limits of their speed.

07:08.602 --> 07:10.342
- I'm nothing like you.

07:10.386 --> 07:12.257
- No, I'm the one who's gonna
get his speed back.

07:12.301 --> 07:14.259
When I do,

07:14.303 --> 07:17.175
when I gain control
of this body,

07:17.219 --> 07:19.743
when I reconnect
to my Speed Force,

07:19.787 --> 07:22.180
you--

07:22.224 --> 07:25.009
you're gonna be too weak
to stop me, aren't you?

07:25.053 --> 07:27.316
Just like you were powerless

07:27.359 --> 07:30.928
to save your daughter.

07:30.972 --> 07:33.278
I miss my Little Runner.

07:33.322 --> 07:35.193
- Nora was never yours.

07:35.237 --> 07:37.369
- Do it.
Do it.

07:37.413 --> 07:41.765
I wonder, how much speed will
you have left after I'm gone?

07:43.245 --> 07:44.507
- Barry, no!

08:05.180 --> 08:07.965
- He tricked us.
Again.

08:08.009 --> 08:10.054
Should've known
supercharging the EMP

08:10.098 --> 08:11.665
would cause a recoil loop.

08:11.708 --> 08:13.144
- Thawne always has
a backup plan.

08:13.188 --> 08:14.406
- I checked the footage.

08:14.450 --> 08:15.669
Thawne only went
to the Starchives,

08:15.712 --> 08:18.323
nowhere else.
How's Nash?

08:18.367 --> 08:21.196
- Better, now that you're not
trying to kill him.

08:22.371 --> 08:24.329
We really gonna do it?

08:27.028 --> 08:28.203
- I don't know.

08:28.246 --> 08:31.598
- Nash needs help,
not maiming.

08:32.686 --> 08:34.209
You can't be here, Barry.

08:36.037 --> 08:38.692
- Why not?
- Because your Speed Gauge

08:38.735 --> 08:40.737
registered a massive loss
of speed,

08:40.781 --> 08:43.348
which means not only does
using your powers affect it,

08:43.392 --> 08:45.089
but so does your anger.

08:45.133 --> 08:46.874
- Caitlin, I'll be fine,
all right?

08:46.917 --> 08:49.659
And if I need more speed, I'll
use a booster like Velocity-X--

08:49.703 --> 08:51.443
- Oh, great,

08:51.487 --> 08:53.010
so you're just gonna start
taking speed steroids now?

08:53.054 --> 08:55.012
Barry, every test we've run

08:55.056 --> 08:57.101
says that physiology,
you have changed drastically,

08:57.145 --> 09:00.191
so we have no idea what
Velocity-X would do to you.

09:00.235 --> 09:02.063
It could hurt you,
it could hurt others--

09:02.106 --> 09:03.586
- Other people
are already hurt.

09:03.630 --> 09:05.240
I mean, we have no idea
what Thawne is doing

09:05.283 --> 09:06.763
to Nash right now.

09:06.807 --> 09:08.199
- And he could do
even more damage to you

09:08.243 --> 09:10.419
if he just gets under
your skin again.

09:12.595 --> 09:16.686
- Look, I know
this is hard for you,

09:16.730 --> 09:18.122
but you need to leave.

09:19.515 --> 09:22.213
You can't trust yourself
around him.

09:22.257 --> 09:23.954
- What you mean is
you can't trust me around him.

09:30.439 --> 09:33.050
- Okay, got your message
about Thawne,

09:33.094 --> 09:34.878
so I brought, uh, holy water,

09:34.922 --> 09:37.620
uh, garlic,

09:37.664 --> 09:39.056
wooden stake,

09:39.100 --> 09:41.493
salt, obviously,

09:41.537 --> 09:43.931
and Ouija board.

09:43.974 --> 09:45.933
- Cecile.
- What?

09:45.976 --> 09:47.587
It's an exorcism.

09:47.630 --> 09:49.719
It's not like we can be
too prepared.

09:49.763 --> 09:52.592
- This isn't some kind
of vampire demon,

09:52.635 --> 09:54.419
this is...

09:54.463 --> 09:56.421
this is something else.

09:56.465 --> 09:57.727
- Oh, my God.

09:57.771 --> 09:59.642
Everything that Nash
is feeling inside,

09:59.686 --> 10:02.514
it's still just raw hatred.

10:02.558 --> 10:04.081
- What we think of as Thawne

10:04.125 --> 10:06.170
is actually just a series
of negative tachyons

10:06.214 --> 10:07.781
inside Nash's body.

10:07.824 --> 10:09.652
So we gotta hit him
with positive tachyons

10:09.696 --> 10:11.611
to force Thawne out.

10:11.654 --> 10:15.658
That's why we need the PTD,
or the Positive Tachyon Device,

10:15.702 --> 10:18.139
and not a Ouija board.
No offense.

10:18.182 --> 10:20.750
- Okay, so,
what do you need me for?

10:20.794 --> 10:22.665
- You're gonna be
my Thawne detector.

10:22.709 --> 10:25.276
I need you to
psychically monitor Nash

10:25.320 --> 10:28.453
and tell me when he's free
from Thawne's influence.

10:28.497 --> 10:30.673
You think you can handle that?

10:30.717 --> 10:32.849
- After what Thawne did
to the people that we love?

10:34.677 --> 10:35.983
Hell yeah.

10:36.026 --> 10:38.942
- Then it's time
for an exorcism.

10:45.601 --> 10:48.648
- ...worshipping a plant.
People are idiots.

10:48.691 --> 10:51.346
Hey, hey.
Kid!

10:51.389 --> 10:53.174
How'd you get in here?
How'd you get past my...

10:53.217 --> 10:56.090
Security drone.

10:57.526 --> 11:00.485
All right, who are you?
What's your name?

11:00.529 --> 11:02.705
- It's Maya.
You actually caught it.

11:02.749 --> 11:04.489
No one's ever pulled
the Blood Bloom

11:04.533 --> 11:06.491
out of the Wollip's mouth
before.

11:06.535 --> 11:10.495
- Yeah, right.
Well, the Wollip, kid,

11:10.539 --> 11:12.846
is just a statue rigged
by the locals, that's all.

11:12.889 --> 11:15.805
- I know.
- You do?

11:15.849 --> 11:17.415
- You gonna get the treasure
out of the Bloom?

11:17.459 --> 11:22.072
- Yeah, I'm gonna get
the treasure out of the Bloom.

11:22.116 --> 11:25.815
What--you mean the crystals?
- No, I mean the treasure.

11:25.859 --> 11:27.338
- What treasure?
- Inside.

11:27.382 --> 11:29.384
- I don't know if they--
hey, hey, hey--oh!

11:31.647 --> 11:36.173
This is worth three times more
than those dumb crystals.

11:43.877 --> 11:45.617
- I'm impressed, kid.

11:46.923 --> 11:49.752
But you broke one of the rules.

11:49.796 --> 11:52.581
You see, you never
give anybody anything

11:52.624 --> 11:55.453
unless you get something
in return.

11:55.497 --> 11:56.759
- Nice hat.

12:01.242 --> 12:03.070
Now scram.

12:03.113 --> 12:05.855
And when you tell your parents
where you got the hat from,

12:05.899 --> 12:07.857
make sure you tell them
you earned it.

12:07.901 --> 12:10.120
- I don't have parents.

12:11.687 --> 12:13.776
Not anymore.

12:15.604 --> 12:16.910
- Maya.

12:18.912 --> 12:22.742
How'd you like to do what I do?

12:22.785 --> 12:25.222
- What's that?
- Myth busting.

12:25.266 --> 12:28.051
Archeological myth busting.

12:28.095 --> 12:30.097
That's what all this is for.
You like the sound of that?

12:30.140 --> 12:32.229
- Yes.
- Yeah.

12:32.273 --> 12:34.449
Yeah,
I think you'd be good at it.

12:34.492 --> 12:38.932
And rule number one:
the prize is everything.

12:38.975 --> 12:40.760
Think you can remember that?

12:40.803 --> 12:43.675
- The prize is everything.
Easy peasy.

12:52.119 --> 12:56.906
- Cisco, Nash is hurting.
What's happening?

12:56.950 --> 12:59.735
- How should I know?
It's my first exorcism.

13:00.867 --> 13:03.695
- Welcome to Hell.

13:03.739 --> 13:05.175
- I can't be here.

13:07.003 --> 13:09.353
- Too late.

13:09.397 --> 13:12.443
- All the pain that's being
brought up in Nash--

13:12.487 --> 13:14.097
it's overwhelming him.

13:14.141 --> 13:15.969
- It's how Thawne gains
his strength.

13:16.012 --> 13:19.450
He feeds on that pain.
- Then he's feasting on Nash.

13:23.150 --> 13:25.108
- From what we've heard
at the "Citizen,"

13:25.152 --> 13:27.545
Mercury Labs is making massive
developments in clean energy.

13:27.589 --> 13:29.112
- We are,

13:29.156 --> 13:30.810
and Dr. McGee is thrilled
to speak to you about it.

13:30.853 --> 13:32.855
If you'll wait right here,
I'll go grab her.

13:32.899 --> 13:34.552
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

13:36.163 --> 13:38.730
Is this the place?

13:38.774 --> 13:41.472
- According to my readings,
the Prismatic Refractor is...

13:46.521 --> 13:47.696
Here.

13:47.739 --> 13:49.480
- Yes.

13:59.012 --> 14:01.666
- Another light-based meta?
- Must be one of Carver's.

14:01.710 --> 14:03.973
Which means he's after
the Refractor too.

14:04.017 --> 14:05.888
We gotta get out of here.

14:07.890 --> 14:09.674
- But the Refractor.
Eva said--

14:09.718 --> 14:11.154
- No, don't worry.

14:11.198 --> 14:12.895
We'll let the Flash
handle this one.

14:16.943 --> 14:18.727
- It's a meta robbery
at Mercury Labs.

14:18.770 --> 14:20.033
- Okay, I'll meet you there.

14:20.076 --> 14:21.512
- No, Frost and I
can handle this.

14:21.556 --> 14:22.687
You need to stay here
and conserve your speed.

14:22.731 --> 14:23.993
Doctor's orders.

14:24.037 --> 14:26.039
- But, Frost, I--
- Doctor's orders.

14:35.744 --> 14:38.965
- Put that down.
- Not happening.

14:40.749 --> 14:43.186
- Fine.
Have it your way.

14:47.147 --> 14:48.539
- So you're the ice queen,
huh?

14:48.583 --> 14:50.106
- What do they call you?

14:53.327 --> 14:57.244
- Call me... Sunshine.

14:59.594 --> 15:02.031
- Ice versus sun.
Guess who melts?

15:21.442 --> 15:23.270
- Flash?
I said I had this handled.

15:23.313 --> 15:25.315
- Don't worry.
This won't take long.

15:25.359 --> 15:26.316
- Flash, wait.

15:31.278 --> 15:32.757
- Dr. Light sends her regards.

15:36.152 --> 15:37.806
- Frost!

15:37.849 --> 15:40.113
- Word around Black Hole
is you're quite the badass.

15:40.156 --> 15:41.549
You could've been one of us.

15:42.637 --> 15:44.117
- Freeze!

15:48.512 --> 15:50.862
- Frost.

15:50.906 --> 15:53.822
- You okay?
- Ow, aah.

16:02.744 --> 16:05.268
- So we're looking at
not one or two,

16:05.312 --> 16:07.357
but three Black Hole
light assassins.

16:07.401 --> 16:09.316
All of them
are under Carver's payroll.

16:09.359 --> 16:11.535
- Each one more powerful
than the last.

16:11.579 --> 16:15.496
Sunshine reopened Frost's wound
from Dr. Light's photon bullet.

16:15.539 --> 16:17.498
Her ice healing's
working overtime.

16:17.541 --> 16:19.021
This is my fault.

16:19.065 --> 16:21.981
If I'd just listened to Caitlin
and stayed behind.

16:22.024 --> 16:25.810
- Hey, you had a glitch in your
speed back there, didn't you?

16:25.854 --> 16:28.161
- I used Velocity-X
to boost my powers,

16:28.204 --> 16:29.379
but my body rejected it.

16:29.423 --> 16:31.033
Caitlin warned me
it could happen.

16:31.077 --> 16:32.643
- Look, I know you don't like
taking a backseat,

16:32.687 --> 16:34.210
but until you can manage
your powers, Barry--

16:34.254 --> 16:36.125
- I know.
I have to be more careful.

16:36.169 --> 16:38.475
Do we know anything
about Sunshine?

16:38.519 --> 16:41.739
- Only that she can disappear
in sunlight and melt steel.

16:41.783 --> 16:43.698
- Her name is Millie Rawlins.

16:43.741 --> 16:46.179
Kamilla took a photo before
we got out of Mercury Labs.

16:46.222 --> 16:48.007
We ran it through S.T.A.R.
Lab's facial recognition

16:48.050 --> 16:50.748
and got a hit at the Department
of Defense's Database.

16:50.792 --> 16:53.055
- Ex-military, special ops.
- Yeah.

16:53.099 --> 16:54.578
She was transferred
to the covert division

16:54.622 --> 16:56.189
after the Particle Accelerator
explosion

16:56.232 --> 16:58.147
left her with the meta-ability
to bend sunlight.

16:58.191 --> 17:00.323
Her call sign was Sunshine.

17:02.586 --> 17:04.501
Do we know what she was after?

17:04.545 --> 17:06.373
- Yep.

17:06.416 --> 17:08.723
Mercury Labs says
it's a one-of-a-kind,

17:08.766 --> 17:10.942
advanced energy converter.

17:10.986 --> 17:13.597
It used to be owned
by McCulloch Technologies.

17:13.641 --> 17:16.557
They're calling it
a Prismatic Refractor.

17:18.385 --> 17:19.951
- Carver was stealing
his own technology?

17:19.995 --> 17:23.520
Why?
- We don't know why yet,

17:23.564 --> 17:26.393
but I'm glad you two were okay.

17:27.742 --> 17:29.874
Iris.

17:29.918 --> 17:32.181
- Oh, um...

17:32.225 --> 17:34.923
Sorry, babe.
My reporter brain.

17:34.966 --> 17:36.620
I'm glad you're okay.

17:36.664 --> 17:40.102
- Shouldn't that thing be
at CCPD in evidence lockup?

17:40.146 --> 17:42.409
- Well, if Carver's trying
to get this,

17:42.452 --> 17:45.107
we can't risk his mole
gaining access.

17:45.151 --> 17:46.630
I put in a call to A.R.G.U.S.

17:46.674 --> 17:48.067
Until they have it
in their custody,

17:48.110 --> 17:49.546
I'm not letting it
out of my sight.

17:49.590 --> 17:51.548
- Well, we could keep it here
at S.T.A.R. Labs

17:51.592 --> 17:53.420
for the time being.

17:53.463 --> 17:55.726
- If Sunshine is as ruthless
as Dr. Light and Ultraviolet,

17:55.770 --> 17:57.293
then she's coming after
that Refractor again,

17:57.337 --> 18:00.079
and if she shows up
at S.T.A.R. Labs,

18:00.122 --> 18:02.298
the Flash isn't gonna be able
to do anything to stop her.

18:02.342 --> 18:03.865
Let A.R.G.U.S. take it.

18:07.173 --> 18:09.740
- Barry's right about Sunshine.

18:09.784 --> 18:11.916
What if she strikes during
the transfer to A.R.G.U.S.?

18:11.960 --> 18:14.484
- Let me worry about that.
Go see after your husband.

18:14.528 --> 18:17.096
- Yeah, yeah, of course,
I was--

18:17.139 --> 18:18.836
I was just about to.

18:25.626 --> 18:27.671
Wanna get away?

18:27.715 --> 18:30.631
- I just needed
a place to think.

18:30.674 --> 18:34.591
- Look, I know losing
your speed is scary.

18:34.635 --> 18:37.246
Especially with
Thawne showing up.

18:37.290 --> 18:39.944
But, Barry, the man that I love
would not let limits

18:39.988 --> 18:42.208
keep him from doing
what he does best...

18:43.731 --> 18:46.255
Taking down metas
and protecting people.

18:46.299 --> 18:49.476
- The Flash isn't supposed
to have limits, Iris.

18:53.001 --> 18:54.959
- Uh...

18:55.003 --> 18:57.353
- Look, if Thawne
gets his powers back,

18:57.397 --> 18:59.268
I won't be able to stop him.

18:59.312 --> 19:01.270
Just like I can't
stop Sunshine.

19:01.314 --> 19:03.229
- Well, maybe the Flash can't
stop them, but...

19:04.926 --> 19:06.101
Barry Allen can.

19:07.624 --> 19:09.800
I mean, so what the Flash can't
run as fast as he used to?

19:09.844 --> 19:11.498
Barry Allen
was taking down villains

19:11.541 --> 19:13.152
long before
the Flash came along.

19:14.544 --> 19:18.722
Barry, you are just as much
of a hero as the Flash.

19:18.766 --> 19:20.637
That's why the city gave you
the medal of honor.

19:22.117 --> 19:23.858
I mean, are you really gonna
let CCPD

19:23.901 --> 19:25.686
handle Sunshine by themselves?

19:25.729 --> 19:28.993
- I don't see how I can help
them without my speed.

19:29.037 --> 19:30.212
- Barry,

19:30.256 --> 19:31.648
it's like you're stuck
on this idea

19:31.692 --> 19:34.477
that the Flash
is supposed to be limitless,

19:34.521 --> 19:37.306
but metas are the ones
that have limits.

19:37.350 --> 19:38.829
I mean, think about it.

19:38.873 --> 19:41.397
Where would the Ringmaster be
without his rings?

19:41.441 --> 19:43.660
Or Cicada without that dagger?

19:43.704 --> 19:45.227
Even Reverse-Flash
and Sunshine,

19:45.271 --> 19:46.489
they--they have their limits.

19:48.099 --> 19:51.320
You just have to figure out
what they are.

19:54.889 --> 19:56.717
- You're right.

19:57.761 --> 19:59.241
Sunshine does have limits.

20:00.721 --> 20:03.071
I have to find Joe.

20:10.992 --> 20:12.689
Hey, Kamilla.

20:12.733 --> 20:15.039
I know where
the Refractor's going.

20:15.083 --> 20:17.041
Get ready to move fast.

20:20.262 --> 20:22.699
- Why are you keeping me here?

20:22.743 --> 20:24.919
- I went through your memories,
Nash.

20:24.962 --> 20:28.531
I plumbed your depths.
Came up with this little gem.

20:29.793 --> 20:32.448
It's awful, isn't it?

20:32.492 --> 20:33.971
It's dark.

20:34.015 --> 20:37.975
It's negative.
- Nash!

20:38.019 --> 20:40.891
Nash!
- Oh, Maya.

20:40.935 --> 20:43.764
Quite the overachiever.
Right?

20:43.807 --> 20:45.722
Perfect employee.

20:45.766 --> 20:48.551
A real go-getter.

20:48.595 --> 20:51.598
When she went to go get
the Sonic Emitter

20:51.641 --> 20:55.254
atop the highest peak on
Corto Maltese--remember that?

20:55.297 --> 20:57.995
And plucked that, so determined
to get the Emitter.

20:58.039 --> 21:01.303
Because after all...

21:03.305 --> 21:05.655
The prize is everything,

21:05.699 --> 21:07.091
isn't it?

21:07.135 --> 21:08.136
- Let me go!

21:08.179 --> 21:10.269
- Want out of this memory?

21:11.966 --> 21:13.620
Be my guest.

21:15.622 --> 21:16.840
You don't wanna leave
this memory?

21:16.884 --> 21:18.146
Why?
Did--

21:18.189 --> 21:20.279
did something happen
in that cave?

21:20.322 --> 21:22.150
- It was not my fault.
It was not my fault!

21:22.193 --> 21:24.108
- Oh, that's right.
- It was her fault!

21:24.152 --> 21:26.850
It was not my fault.

21:26.894 --> 21:29.418
- She died.
- It's not my fault!

21:29.462 --> 21:31.594
- It was all your fault.

21:31.638 --> 21:35.206
- It was her fault.
It was not my fault.

21:37.687 --> 21:38.949
- I don't understand.

21:38.993 --> 21:40.777
I've got the PTDs
on full blast.

21:40.821 --> 21:43.040
Thawne's negative tachyon's
should be destabilizing,

21:43.084 --> 21:44.955
but the neuron data
isn't showing any resistance.

21:44.999 --> 21:46.783
If anything,
his energy's intensifying.

21:48.350 --> 21:49.786
- What the hell is he doing
to you in there?

21:49.830 --> 21:51.310
- I barely even feel
Nash anymore,

21:51.353 --> 21:53.224
I just--all I--

21:53.268 --> 21:57.054
all I feel is fear and shame
all around me.

21:57.098 --> 21:59.143
I can't--I can't--
I don't think I can...

21:59.187 --> 22:01.320
- Cisco, are you okay?

22:01.363 --> 22:03.452
- Almost there.

22:13.070 --> 22:15.508
These won't hold me.

22:23.211 --> 22:24.734
What the hell just happened?

22:24.778 --> 22:26.388
- Thawne just connected
to his Speed Force.

22:26.432 --> 22:29.522
If that happens again,
we lose Nash forever.

22:31.872 --> 22:33.961
The Reverse-Flash lives again.

22:43.579 --> 22:45.015
- A.R.G.U.S. secure transports

22:45.059 --> 22:46.539
should be here any minute,
Captain.

22:46.582 --> 22:47.931
- Good job, Korber.

22:47.975 --> 22:49.411
Let me know
as soon as they land.

22:49.455 --> 22:51.108
Thanks.

22:53.546 --> 22:55.243
Hey.
- Captain.

22:56.549 --> 22:59.029
I understand you're moving that
thing out of CCPD custody.

22:59.073 --> 23:00.509
I'm here to oversee
the transfer.

23:00.553 --> 23:02.859
- Really?
Why?

23:02.903 --> 23:05.514
- Well, I did a little
lunchtime reading

23:05.558 --> 23:07.386
as you suggested.

23:07.429 --> 23:09.649
And I agree with you.

23:10.911 --> 23:13.217
I think Carver
has someone on the inside.

23:13.261 --> 23:15.437
And we need to investigate this
ourselves.

23:15.481 --> 23:16.830
- Thank you, David.

23:19.572 --> 23:21.443
- I knew I picked the right man
to lead this precinct.

23:23.489 --> 23:24.794
- They're here.
East loading dock.

23:24.838 --> 23:26.274
- Let's roll.
- All right.

23:43.596 --> 23:45.249
- Thank you for coming,
gentlemen.

23:45.293 --> 23:47.426
You all set?
- We're all set, Chief.

23:47.469 --> 23:49.079
- At ease.

23:49.123 --> 23:51.081
- Look out!

23:51.125 --> 23:52.735

23:52.779 --> 23:55.564

- Back, back, back, back, back!

24:08.969 --> 24:10.361
- Just turn over
the Refractor.

24:55.406 --> 24:57.887
- Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

25:07.854 --> 25:10.073
Oh.

25:13.860 --> 25:16.384
No!

25:20.562 --> 25:22.564
- Yep.
You're helio-kinetic.

25:22.608 --> 25:26.307
So without access to sunlight,
you're just an ordinary thief.

25:28.091 --> 25:30.877
Limits suck, don't they?

25:34.750 --> 25:36.665
- So, our house is clear,

25:36.709 --> 25:38.449
the Refractor's safe and sound
with A.R.G.U.S.

25:38.493 --> 25:40.277
- You sure you're okay, Chief?

25:40.321 --> 25:42.584
- Yeah, I got a hard head.
Just ask my husband.

25:45.326 --> 25:47.676
- Hey, Joe, what if Sunshine
was our mole?

25:47.720 --> 25:50.374
No one would have seen her
doctor those files.

25:50.418 --> 25:55.075
- Um, she's the perfect
invisible agent.

25:55.118 --> 25:58.034
Look, if we pin her down here,

25:58.078 --> 26:01.734
she can be the brick for
building Carver's RICO case.

26:01.777 --> 26:04.606
You coming?
- No, you go ahead.

26:04.650 --> 26:06.565
I have something else
I have to take care of.

26:09.611 --> 26:11.221
- Why isn't this working?

26:11.265 --> 26:13.441
- Thawne's tachyons
are proliferating at a rate

26:13.484 --> 26:15.574
that exceeds
the PTD's capabilities.

26:15.617 --> 26:16.792
So it's just a matter of time

26:16.836 --> 26:18.881
before Thawne takes over
Nash's body.

26:18.925 --> 26:20.709
- What happens to Nash?

26:20.753 --> 26:22.885
And to the other Wellses?

26:22.929 --> 26:25.584
- They'll be in a living hell.

26:25.627 --> 26:29.413
Trapped inside
Thawne's psyche forever.

26:29.457 --> 26:31.720
He'll be able to siphon
their knowledge.

26:31.764 --> 26:34.244
If he gets loose, we can't risk
him having Nash's mind

26:34.288 --> 26:36.725
and his gadgets.
We have to destroy these.

26:39.162 --> 26:41.904
Is that Allegra?
- No, it's a doppelganger.

26:41.948 --> 26:44.646
Maybe that's why
Nash hung around so much.

26:44.690 --> 26:46.517
Allegra reminds him
of someone he knew.

26:48.128 --> 26:51.000
- Reminds him...
reminds him!

26:51.044 --> 26:55.135
Everything that he's been
feeling, all of his emotions,

26:55.178 --> 26:58.660
they remind me of how I feel
when I think about Joanie

26:58.704 --> 27:03.622
or Jenna.
It's--it's almost parental.

27:03.665 --> 27:06.363
But it's not just that,

27:06.407 --> 27:08.452
it's mixed with the feeling
that I had in '95

27:08.496 --> 27:12.674
when my mom passed away.

27:12.718 --> 27:15.851
Grief.
Oh, my God, Cisco.

27:15.895 --> 27:19.986
I think that Nash is caught up
in a loop,

27:20.029 --> 27:24.643
and it's made out of remorse
and sadness.

27:24.686 --> 27:26.470
- Negativity.

27:26.514 --> 27:28.342
- I think that Allegra's
doppelganger died.

27:28.385 --> 27:30.779
- What could be more painful
than the loss of a child?

27:30.823 --> 27:33.695
Cecile, if you're right,

27:33.739 --> 27:37.568
then Thawne is holding Nash
in the memory of her death.

27:37.612 --> 27:40.659
- That's why Nash has to be
the one to expel Thawne.

27:40.702 --> 27:42.312
We're gonna help him.

27:42.356 --> 27:43.879
- The M.A.D. 2.0.

27:43.923 --> 27:45.968
- We used it to get inside
the Thinker's mind.

27:46.012 --> 27:48.318
This time we're
going inside Nash's,

27:48.362 --> 27:50.233
and together,
we'll force Thawne out

27:50.277 --> 27:51.844
from the inside.

28:01.767 --> 28:03.159
- You sure
you wanna do this?

28:03.203 --> 28:05.684
- We can't risk you losing
anymore speed.

28:05.727 --> 28:08.338
- I won't.
Trust me.

28:08.382 --> 28:09.731
- Hang on, boys.

28:09.775 --> 28:12.908
It's gonna be a bumpy ride.

28:15.432 --> 28:17.696
- It's not my fault.
It's not my fault.

28:20.046 --> 28:22.048
Not my fault.
Not my fault.

28:22.091 --> 28:23.527
It's not my fault.

28:23.571 --> 28:26.182
It's not my fault,
it's not my fault,

28:26.226 --> 28:29.533
it's not my fault,
it's not my fault...

28:29.577 --> 28:31.710
- It's time for you to go,
Thawne.

28:33.276 --> 28:35.322
- You're too late, Flash.

28:37.498 --> 28:39.282
Nash is mine.

28:40.066 --> 28:41.545
- Nash!

28:41.589 --> 28:42.851
- No, not yet he isn't.

28:42.895 --> 28:44.374
- Hey, hey.

28:44.418 --> 28:47.769
Cisco.
You came for me.

28:47.813 --> 28:49.075
- Yeah, but you're the only one

28:49.118 --> 28:50.859
who can get yourself
out of here, Nash.

28:50.903 --> 28:52.643
- You want Nash, you're gonna
have to go through me.

28:52.687 --> 28:55.734
- Aren't you a glutton
for punishment?

28:55.777 --> 28:58.040
Always there to bear witness

28:58.084 --> 29:01.783
to the death of someone you're
trying to desperately save.

29:01.827 --> 29:03.219
- Oh, you're not gonna win
this time.

29:03.263 --> 29:04.960
- I think I am.
Look at him.

29:05.004 --> 29:06.048
- Hey, look,
whatever's in there,

29:06.092 --> 29:07.310
I think you need to go face it.

29:07.354 --> 29:08.790
- No, no.
I can't go in there.

29:08.834 --> 29:10.923
- He's weak.
He's pathetic.

29:10.966 --> 29:13.664
He's limited by his emotions.

29:13.708 --> 29:15.754
Just like you.

29:15.797 --> 29:16.972
- He wants you to stay here.

29:17.016 --> 29:18.278
The more you suffer,

29:18.321 --> 29:20.062
the stronger he gets.
- No, no.

29:20.106 --> 29:21.977
Prize is everything.

29:22.021 --> 29:23.370
- Allegra's doppelganger.

29:24.937 --> 29:27.069
That's her, isn't it?
She's in there.

29:27.113 --> 29:28.288
- Maya.

29:28.331 --> 29:30.333
Her name is Maya.

29:30.377 --> 29:33.815
- In a few short moments
I'm gonna...

29:33.859 --> 29:36.818
bust through Cisco's tachyon
field and then...

29:38.994 --> 29:41.083
Then the fun's
really gonna begin.

29:41.127 --> 29:46.785
All fueled by poor Nash's grief
for his precious daughter.

29:46.828 --> 29:50.353
You know a few things
about grief

29:50.397 --> 29:52.312
for a precious daughter,
don't you?

29:55.358 --> 29:56.838
No, Barry.

29:58.492 --> 30:00.711
- Barry, come on.
Don't let him get to you.

30:00.755 --> 30:02.452
Don't let him get to you.

30:02.496 --> 30:07.675
- You didn't make the most of
your time with your daughter.

30:07.718 --> 30:09.024
I taught her everything I know

30:09.068 --> 30:11.810
while you sat by
and did nothing!

30:11.853 --> 30:13.376
- She made a bad choice,
that's all.

30:13.420 --> 30:15.117
She just made a choice.

30:15.161 --> 30:16.510
That's all.

30:16.553 --> 30:17.859
- Listen to me.
- She made a bad choice.

30:17.903 --> 30:19.948
- Listen to me!
- No, I cannot!

30:19.992 --> 30:21.994
- If you don't go into that
cave, you're gonna die.

30:22.037 --> 30:23.952
- I cannot go into that cave!

30:23.996 --> 30:28.087
- All you did was stifle
her abilities.

30:29.610 --> 30:31.655
You were an awful father
to her.

30:37.357 --> 30:39.272
- I miss my daughter every day.

30:40.186 --> 30:43.015
But I'm done letting that
give you power over me.

30:47.933 --> 30:51.675
- I watched Cynthia die
and it hurt me in places

30:51.719 --> 30:53.329
I didn't even know
I could feel pain.

30:55.897 --> 30:59.509
I couldn't avoid it.

30:59.553 --> 31:01.250
You can't heal if you avoid it.

31:02.425 --> 31:06.734
- You think that Nash and I
are limited by our emotions.

31:06.777 --> 31:08.692
But you're wrong.

31:08.736 --> 31:11.434
They give us our strength,

31:11.478 --> 31:14.873
and we can use them
to overcome anything.

31:14.916 --> 31:18.180
Including you.

31:18.224 --> 31:20.922
That's your greatest flaw,
Thawne.

31:20.966 --> 31:24.534
Metas are the ones with limits.

31:24.578 --> 31:26.754
Not people.

31:26.797 --> 31:29.061
Not me.

31:29.104 --> 31:33.239
And not Nash.
- You have to face that memory.

31:33.282 --> 31:36.416
And when you do,
I'll be here waiting for you.

31:38.984 --> 31:41.160
I promise.

31:53.433 --> 31:56.131
- No, you're not
getting past me.

32:07.447 --> 32:10.450
- You got this, Maya.
Easy peasy.

32:22.679 --> 32:25.421
- Nash!
The last memory cell is here!

32:25.465 --> 32:27.293
- Grab it,
and I'll pull you back up.

32:27.336 --> 32:30.252
Don't do it.

32:30.296 --> 32:32.951
- You got it?

32:34.474 --> 32:36.780
Guess the cave doesn't wanna
let this thing go.

32:36.824 --> 32:38.434
It's stuck.

32:38.478 --> 32:40.436
- All right, well, kay,
you're at--you're at the end!

32:40.480 --> 32:42.786
- Don't do it.
- Remember your training!

32:44.745 --> 32:47.966
The prize is everything.

32:48.009 --> 32:49.141
- Stop her!

32:53.928 --> 32:56.017
- Prize is everything.

32:56.061 --> 32:57.671
- No.

33:00.500 --> 33:03.633
I got it!
Easy peasy.

33:03.677 --> 33:06.245
Easy peasy!

33:09.683 --> 33:10.989
- Maya...

33:11.032 --> 33:13.034
Nash!

33:13.078 --> 33:15.297
- Maya, Maya--

33:15.341 --> 33:17.691
Maya!
Maya!

33:20.346 --> 33:23.566
- Let it go.
Let it go.

33:23.610 --> 33:25.220
- Maya.

33:26.787 --> 33:28.310
- No!

33:30.225 --> 33:32.923
- No!

33:36.623 --> 33:38.494
Oh, no...

34:08.916 --> 34:10.613
- It was my fault.

34:12.746 --> 34:14.965
She only did
what I taught her to do.

34:18.752 --> 34:20.319
It was my fault.

34:22.103 --> 34:23.974
It was my fault.

34:24.018 --> 34:26.064
- Nash has taken control
of his pain.

34:26.107 --> 34:27.369
- No.

34:27.413 --> 34:29.197
- You can't feed
off of him anymore.

34:29.241 --> 34:30.372
- No.

34:41.035 --> 34:43.298
- It's over, Thawne.
- No.

34:48.695 --> 34:51.132
- No, no.

34:51.176 --> 34:54.179
No!

35:19.291 --> 35:21.162
- Hey, Nash.
I'm here.

35:21.206 --> 35:24.252
Are you okay?
- He will be.

35:24.296 --> 35:26.124
I need a nap.

35:26.167 --> 35:28.169
- You're okay.
You're okay.

35:28.213 --> 35:32.521
Nash, I'm here.
I'm here.

35:34.654 --> 35:36.264
It was my fault.

35:39.224 --> 35:42.140
It was all my fault.

35:52.498 --> 35:54.674
- The satellite scans
say there are no traces

35:54.717 --> 35:56.371
of Thawne's negative tachyons

35:56.415 --> 35:58.808
to be found in any
organic matter on the planet.

35:58.852 --> 36:00.288
As for Nash,

36:00.332 --> 36:01.898
Cecile confirmed
that she didn't feel

36:01.942 --> 36:03.552
any of Thawne's energy inside.

36:03.596 --> 36:05.641
- According to
three-dimensional imaging,

36:05.685 --> 36:09.341
Nash's brainwaves
are Thawne-free.

36:09.384 --> 36:12.909
- I guess this means S.T.A.R
Labs has successfully completed

36:12.953 --> 36:15.651
it's very first exorcism.
- Thawne's gone.

36:15.695 --> 36:17.000
For now.
- Right.

36:17.044 --> 36:18.567
Thawne's tachyons
might've dissipated,

36:18.611 --> 36:20.395
but they weren't destroyed.

36:20.439 --> 36:24.182
- Which means he's not dead.
Just formless.

36:24.225 --> 36:26.053
- He's probably out there
looking for another body

36:26.096 --> 36:29.535
right now, like a red-eyed,
pissed off, Voldemort.

36:29.578 --> 36:31.624
- He comes back,
we'll be ready.

36:33.800 --> 36:34.931
- I'm gonna go check on Nash.

36:34.975 --> 36:38.674
Are you, uh--
are you good?

36:38.718 --> 36:40.241
- Yeah.

36:40.285 --> 36:42.678
I have someone
I should check on too.

36:47.553 --> 36:49.076
- What was it like?

36:49.119 --> 36:51.034
- Like being in fog.

36:51.078 --> 36:54.212
You know what it was like?
It was like being underwater.

36:54.255 --> 36:57.389
I could see, I could hear,

36:57.432 --> 37:00.392
but it was--it was hazy,
I couldn't do anything--

37:00.435 --> 37:03.395
well, basically, it sucked.

37:03.438 --> 37:06.876
- You're free of it.
Free of Thawne.

37:06.920 --> 37:10.271
As for the other Wellses,
their brainwaves

37:10.315 --> 37:13.709
are unfortunately
still entangled with yours.

37:13.753 --> 37:17.974
So they're as much a part of
you now as yourself.

37:18.018 --> 37:19.280
- Right.

37:19.324 --> 37:20.977
Wait, what?

37:21.021 --> 37:22.414
- Mm-hmm.

37:22.457 --> 37:24.981
- You mean
I'm gonna keep hearing--

37:25.025 --> 37:26.548
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna keep seeing them.

37:26.592 --> 37:28.246
- Yeah.

37:28.289 --> 37:31.901
Crisis of infinite Wells.

37:31.945 --> 37:34.382
Well, I've had worse.
Hey, look,

37:34.426 --> 37:38.821
credit where credit is due.
I know that without your help,

37:38.865 --> 37:40.649
we don't get the psychopath
out of my body,

37:40.693 --> 37:44.262
so for that,
I'm grateful.

37:44.305 --> 37:46.046
Thank you.

37:47.787 --> 37:49.267
See you around
Earth-Prime, kid.

37:49.310 --> 37:51.269
- Aren't you
forgetting something?

37:51.312 --> 37:54.663
- I--I don't think so.

38:01.627 --> 38:05.500
I made a lot of discoveries
in my career, but...

38:07.372 --> 38:09.330
The best discovery...

38:12.333 --> 38:14.335
You know, she treat--
she was...

38:16.990 --> 38:19.035
Just like a daughter...

38:22.996 --> 38:24.737
To me, so...

38:27.653 --> 38:29.307
- And Allegra?
- What about Allegra?

38:29.350 --> 38:32.614
- Sure, she's not Maya,

38:32.658 --> 38:34.703
but you did help her
with her powers.

38:34.747 --> 38:36.357
- But, you know,
we got off to a rocky start.

38:36.401 --> 38:38.228
There's no point in making it
a rocky ending.

38:38.272 --> 38:40.056
- Nash.
- What?

38:40.100 --> 38:41.971
- Pick a Wells.
Any Wells.

38:42.015 --> 38:43.973
- Do I have to?
- No.

38:44.017 --> 38:46.236
It doesn't matter; I got off to
a rocky start with all of them.

38:46.280 --> 38:48.151
- What's your point?
- My point is,

38:48.195 --> 38:50.806
I get how difficult it is
to separate your feelings

38:50.850 --> 38:53.200
about a person
from their doppelganger.

38:53.243 --> 38:55.202
Did I ever tell you
about the time I met Harry?

38:55.245 --> 38:57.683
- You didn't.
That's the Earth-2 Wells?

38:57.726 --> 39:00.207
- The very one.
- All right, go ahead.

39:00.250 --> 39:03.210
- When I first saw him,

39:03.253 --> 39:04.733
all I could see
was Eobard Thawne.

39:06.909 --> 39:08.389
But when I saw him,

39:08.433 --> 39:12.219
when I really saw Harry
for who he was...

39:14.134 --> 39:15.744
I became his friend.

39:16.963 --> 39:18.486
He became mine.

39:18.530 --> 39:23.665
Yeah, you got off to
a bad start with Allegra,

39:23.709 --> 39:26.712
but it's not too late
to build something good.

39:28.975 --> 39:30.498
You're a good egg.

39:30.542 --> 39:32.674
- You're not getting
sappy on me, are you?

39:32.718 --> 39:34.110
- No.

39:35.721 --> 39:37.897
No.

39:39.159 --> 39:40.465
- Good.
- Good.

39:44.556 --> 39:46.079
- He's right.

39:46.122 --> 39:49.735
Ramon, he had a second chance
with Allegra.

39:49.778 --> 39:51.867
It's what we've been trying
to tell you.

39:51.911 --> 39:54.348
You think you're so smart.

40:00.093 --> 40:02.704
- And he's gone.

40:02.748 --> 40:04.445
Well, that's gonna take
some getting used to.

40:10.756 --> 40:14.890
- Caitlin, I--
I need to apologize.

40:14.934 --> 40:17.240
I didn't follow your advice,

40:17.284 --> 40:19.155
and you got hurt because of me.

40:20.374 --> 40:22.724
I'm sorry.
- It's okay, Barry.

40:22.768 --> 40:26.075
I'm on the mend.
Feeling better already.

40:26.119 --> 40:28.121
- So, we're okay?

40:28.164 --> 40:30.253
- Always.

40:30.297 --> 40:33.082
- Status report:
Nash is physically fine,

40:33.126 --> 40:37.217
but emotionally destroyed,
and Cisco is completely bushed.

40:39.132 --> 40:40.829
You guys make up yet?

40:40.873 --> 40:43.136
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank God.

40:43.179 --> 40:45.181
- Guys, are we sure creating
an artificial Speed Force

40:45.225 --> 40:47.749
is the way to go?
I mean,

40:47.793 --> 40:49.925
anyone who came in contact with
Thawne's Speed Force got hurt.

40:49.969 --> 40:51.579
- Ours will be different.

40:51.623 --> 40:53.451
- Yeah, but we still don't even
know where to start.

40:53.494 --> 40:56.018
- Actually, I do.

40:56.062 --> 41:00.936
Every time Thawne tried
to hurt me using Nora's memory,

41:00.980 --> 41:05.506
really what he did was reminded
me how much I loved her.

41:05.550 --> 41:07.987
Made me realize
that she's the answer.

41:11.381 --> 41:13.122
- Nora's journal?

41:13.166 --> 41:15.298
- Thawne taught Nora
how to build a Speed Force.

41:17.039 --> 41:18.998
Now she can teach us.

41:29.225 --> 41:30.618
- And no one saw you?

41:30.662 --> 41:32.533
- CCPD was busy
fighting Sunshine.

41:32.577 --> 41:34.535
- In and out
and no one noticed.

41:34.579 --> 41:38.626
- So my husband
stopped looking for me, but...

41:38.670 --> 41:41.673
apparently still goes out
looking for my toys.

41:43.936 --> 41:46.547
You did very well.

41:46.591 --> 41:48.680
And as long as
we stick to the plan...

41:48.723 --> 41:50.333
both: Success is assured.

41:50.377 --> 41:53.249
- And I'm one step closer
to liberation.
