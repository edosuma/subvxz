00:14.320 --> 00:17.600
Here are all the access codes
to CTU and Division.

00:17.680 --> 00:21.400
- Thanks.
- I'm probably gonna be gone for a while.

00:21.480 --> 00:24.640
If you need anything,
you can always call me at home.

00:24.720 --> 00:27.080
Sir,
Ms Driscoll's replacement arrived.

00:27.160 --> 00:28.840
Tony, thank you for filling in.

00:28.920 --> 00:31.360
And I'd like you to stick around
and assist Ms Dessler.

00:31.440 --> 00:34.840
- Who?
- Michelle Dessler. Do you know her?

00:38.080 --> 00:39.720
I used to be married to her.

00:40.200 --> 00:42.800
- I have to go to McLennan-Forster.
- Why there?

00:42.880 --> 00:45.040
Turns out the man
we're looking for works there.

00:45.120 --> 00:48.000
- Need to get into their computer system?
- Yeah.

00:48.080 --> 00:49.400
OK. I'll go with you.

00:49.840 --> 00:51.840
So how can I help CTU?

00:51.920 --> 00:55.520
One of your employees,
Harris Barnes, is actually Habib Marwan,

00:55.600 --> 00:59.320
a terrorist responsible for today's
attack and theft of the override.

00:59.400 --> 01:03.400
We need you to take your IT systems offline
so Paul can look into his directory.

01:03.880 --> 01:07.960
CTU will subpoena those files.
They will find out the truth.

01:08.040 --> 01:09.640
- Dammit!
- What's he doing?

01:09.720 --> 01:11.760
He's trying to rebuild the files I deleted.

01:11.840 --> 01:13.680
Look at this.

01:15.000 --> 01:20.640
Son of a bitch, it's encrypted.
That's it. Print it out, now. Now!

01:20.720 --> 01:23.000
He's gonna find evidence
we sold arms to terrorists.

01:23.080 --> 01:26.960
The pulse bomb. We have to use it now.

01:27.800 --> 01:29.480
We're dealing with an EMP.

01:29.560 --> 01:33.760
Once it goes off, everything
within its radius that's electrical gets fried.

01:33.840 --> 01:35.000
I'm gonna try and stop it.

01:35.080 --> 01:38.440
If I don't, take the hard copy,
meet me in front of the building.

01:39.440 --> 01:43.280
CTU agent's heading down near you.
Don't let him near it.

01:54.760 --> 01:57.080
Oh, my God.

02:13.320 --> 02:15.560
" Are any electronic devices working?

02:15.640 --> 02:18.320
Only the basic battery-powered devices.

02:18.400 --> 02:22.360
- How many square miles are affected?
- "80, including southeast downtown."

02:22.440 --> 02:25.480
OK. Hold your position
until the readings stabilise.

02:25.560 --> 02:28.200
- Any word from Jack or Paul?
- No.

02:28.280 --> 02:30.920
Once the bomb went off
we lost communication.

02:31.000 --> 02:34.880
- What was the last we heard from them?
- Jack and Paul found something.

02:34.960 --> 02:37.640
It must be incriminating
to McLennan-Forster.

02:37.720 --> 02:40.240
So they set off the EMP
to destroy the evidence.

02:40.320 --> 02:41.480
That's my guess.

02:41.560 --> 02:45.880
The fact that McLennan-Forster
is taking action is evidence against them.

02:45.960 --> 02:48.760
Yeah, but it's not proof.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.240
Curtis.

02:55.320 --> 03:01.000
- Could Jack or Paul have been injured?
- No. An EMP only damages electronics.

03:01.080 --> 03:03.720
But it doesn't mean they're safe.

03:07.720 --> 03:11.240
We know you printed a document
before the EMP detonated.

03:11.320 --> 03:13.480
Where is it?

03:16.800 --> 03:21.520
It's up to you.
You decide when the pain stops.

03:25.280 --> 03:27.680
- Call me when he talks.
- Yes, sir.

03:43.880 --> 03:45.920
" No!

04:00.440 --> 04:03.400
" Drop your gun or I'll kill him.

04:06.440 --> 04:08.960
I said drop it!

04:15.440 --> 04:18.560
Paul, where's the data printout?

04:18.640 --> 04:22.320
I hid it in an office down the hallway.

04:22.400 --> 04:28.200
I know you're hurt, but we've gotta get it
and get out of here. Let's go.

04:33.080 --> 04:34.800
Let's go.

04:52.840 --> 04:55.200
It's in here.

04:59.440 --> 05:01.240
Take a seat.

05:01.320 --> 05:04.120
- Where is it?
- Bottom drawer, under some folders.

05:04.200 --> 05:07.600
I hid it because I thought I might be captured.

05:13.120 --> 05:15.760
- Is this it?
- Yeah, it's in code.

05:15.840 --> 05:18.640
I couldn't make any sense out of it.

05:20.280 --> 05:22.800
We need to get it back to CTU.

05:22.880 --> 05:27.320
- I couldn't have held out much longer.
- You did great.

05:39.640 --> 05:42.200
Let's go.

05:49.760 --> 05:52.440
For those who don't know,
this is Michelle Dessler.

05:52.520 --> 05:56.280
She'll be taking over as acting director of CTU
effective immediately.

05:56.360 --> 05:59.480
Tony, I appreciate you carrying the ball
until she got here.

05:59.560 --> 06:02.040
Why don't you
bring everyone up to speed?

06:02.120 --> 06:04.440
Yes, sir.

06:06.160 --> 06:11.120
Less than an hour ago, we discovered that the
man responsible for planning today's attacks,

06:11.200 --> 06:15.080
Habib Marwan, has been a long-term
employee of McLennan-Forster,

06:15.160 --> 06:18.480
the third-largest defence contractor
in the country.

06:18.560 --> 06:21.920
We know that Marwan's
been using the alias "Harris Barnes".

06:22.000 --> 06:25.160
What we don't know
is how he evaded their security checks.

06:25.240 --> 06:27.880
He knows we're after him
so he's probably gone dark.

06:27.960 --> 06:31.080
His association with McLennan-Forster
is our main focus.

06:31.160 --> 06:34.320
Jack and Paul Raines
went to inspect his computer files,

06:34.400 --> 06:37.320
but as they were doing so,
an EMP bomb was detonated,

06:37.400 --> 06:39.640
wiping out the company's database.

06:39.720 --> 06:42.800
It fried every electrical device
in an eight-mile radius -

06:42.880 --> 06:47.080
streetlights, computers,
cars, cellphones, everything.

06:47.160 --> 06:49.640
Did they find anything before detonation?

06:49.720 --> 06:52.160
Yeah, but we haven't
been able to contact them.

06:52.240 --> 06:54.800
But we have to assume
whoever detonated the EMP

06:54.880 --> 06:57.360
wants Jack and Paul eliminated.

06:57.440 --> 07:00.760
- Have rescue teams been sent into the area?
- Not yet.

07:00.840 --> 07:05.120
Once the effects subside we'll send
two teams in with functioning electronics.

07:05.200 --> 07:09.120
The problem is until we find Jack
and Paul, they won't be able to do much.

07:09.200 --> 07:13.040
We want to do everything we can
to find Jack Bauer and Paul Raines,

07:13.120 --> 07:19.040
but the priority is to retrieve any information
they found at McLennan-Forster.

07:19.120 --> 07:21.640
That's all.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.920
Tony.

07:31.040 --> 07:34.280
I need the access codes for CTU and Division.

07:37.520 --> 07:40.440
- Thank you.
- What do you want me to do?

07:40.520 --> 07:45.520
Division's sending over a supplemental list
of terrorists who've had contact with Marwan.

07:45.600 --> 07:50.680
Check any names that have been flagged
by other agencies, including overseas.

07:50.760 --> 07:55.080
Given what's happening right now,
doesn't seem like the best use of my time.

07:55.160 --> 07:57.480
It has to be done and I'd like you to do it.

07:57.560 --> 08:01.320
Michelle, Jack and Paul have information
that could end this crisis.

08:01.400 --> 08:04.200
I should be helping us find them. Michelle!

08:04.280 --> 08:07.320
When I last saw you,
you couldn't stay sober to keep ajob.

08:07.400 --> 08:09.600
That was six months ago.

08:11.200 --> 08:13.200
This is what I need you to do.

08:13.280 --> 08:15.960
If you don't like it, you can resign.

08:22.720 --> 08:24.880
I'm gonna need a security clearance.

08:24.960 --> 08:27.400
I'll make sure you get a level three.

08:27.480 --> 08:30.280
Level three? I used to have a six.

08:30.360 --> 08:33.159
Right now, all you need is three.

08:41.559 --> 08:44.240
Is there a problem with Agent Almeida?

08:44.320 --> 08:45.920
Not at all.

08:46.000 --> 08:51.280
It's just that Secretary Heller is very sensitive
to personal conflicts on the job.

08:51.360 --> 08:53.760
I know your history,
I know you were married

08:53.840 --> 08:56.960
and that he sacrificed his career
to save your life.

08:57.040 --> 09:01.720
- But if this is gonna be a problem, I...
- His being here will not affect my work.

09:01.800 --> 09:07.640
Now, if Secretary Heller wants to speak to me
about it, I'll be more than glad to.

09:09.720 --> 09:12.080
We are receiving reports from LAPD

09:12.160 --> 09:16.760
indicating that there is widespread looting
going on in the blacked-out zone.

09:16.840 --> 09:20.040
A number of cars have been set on fire
and stores ransacked.

09:20.120 --> 09:23.440
Witnesses report shots were heard.
There may be casualties.

09:23.520 --> 09:25.600
We just don't know at this time.

09:25.680 --> 09:28.400
That could be the same people
that were after Jack.

09:28.480 --> 09:31.680
I don't get it. What could be worth
setting off a pulse bomb?

09:31.760 --> 09:33.720
Something implicating McLennan-Forster.

09:33.800 --> 09:37.960
Anything they're doing now is insignificant
if they helped Marwan today.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.080
- This is Anderson.
- " It's time for you to go."

10:08.160 --> 10:10.320
Marwan, your face is all over the news.

10:10.400 --> 10:13.440
Don't worry about it.
Things will proceed as planned.

10:13.520 --> 10:16.240
- Are you ready?
- Yes, of course.

10:16.320 --> 10:19.560
- "How long will it take you to get there?"
- Less than 30 minutes.

10:19.640 --> 10:22.320
I'll inform the others.

10:57.760 --> 11:03.120
" It's heading to McLennan-Forster.
It's not responding to any of our ID requests.

11:03.200 --> 11:06.520
- You're sure?
- Yeah, I'm positive.

11:06.600 --> 11:08.240
Michelle.

11:08.320 --> 11:10.320
Excuse me.

11:12.080 --> 11:14.680
There's a chopper in the dead zone,
not one of ours.

11:14.760 --> 11:17.240
- Police?
- Not one of theirs either. I checked.

11:17.320 --> 11:19.880
We picked it up by its electronic signature.

11:19.960 --> 11:22.720
- Where's it going?
- Straight to McLennan-Forster.

11:22.800 --> 11:25.840
Could it be some sort of
corporate rescue chopper?

11:25.920 --> 11:29.680
- They'd give the police a call sign.
- It's a search-and-destroy mission.

11:29.760 --> 11:32.440
A chopper that size
carries 20 men, fully armed.

11:32.520 --> 11:36.480
- Who would have sent it?
- Whoever set off the EMP, they're after Jack.

11:36.560 --> 11:39.840
McLennan-Forster's been training
mercenaries for years.

11:39.920 --> 11:44.800
Contact our field teams in the air.
Let them know about the intruding chopper.

11:45.520 --> 11:47.440
I'll be right back.

12:05.240 --> 12:09.720
- Jack, I can't do this.
- You don't have a choice. Come on.

12:17.760 --> 12:20.480
Get me some gear!

12:20.560 --> 12:24.760
These are the men we're looking for.
They have an encoded computer print-out.

12:24.840 --> 12:28.040
We need to erase these two men
and recover the document.

12:28.120 --> 12:30.640
Just be aware,
one of them is a CTU field agent.

12:30.720 --> 12:34.080
- You want us to kill a federal agent?
- I'll take care of him.

12:34.160 --> 12:37.480
He went bad, helped the terrorists,
dragged the company into it.

12:37.560 --> 12:39.520
LAPD is responding to this area.

12:39.600 --> 12:44.440
We'll have to do this quickly if we want to
stay off their radar. Use that to keep in touch.

12:44.520 --> 12:47.160
" We spotted two men
headed east on Addison.

12:47.240 --> 12:51.400
Deploy your men in a flanking position
a mile down the road and then move in.

12:51.480 --> 12:54.320
- We'll fan out and come in from behind.
- You got it.

12:54.400 --> 12:57.280
Get me that chopper
back in the northwest corner.

12:57.360 --> 12:59.360
Let's move.

13:05.880 --> 13:07.880
Come on.

13:13.800 --> 13:16.280
" Come on, this way.

13:21.120 --> 13:23.560
This way.

13:25.200 --> 13:28.360
- Why are we going here?
- Weapons and ammunition.

13:33.480 --> 13:37.320
- " Get away from here!
- Paul, get down!

13:37.400 --> 13:39.880
" Get out of here!
The next one won't miss!

13:39.960 --> 13:43.600
- I'm a federal agent.
- " Sure you are. Get away from here.

13:43.680 --> 13:45.680
Look, we need your help.

13:46.120 --> 13:47.840
Go! Now!

13:47.920 --> 13:50.640
Hey, just relax. I'm leaving.

13:50.720 --> 13:52.760
OK? I'm leaving.

13:55.800 --> 13:57.920
Drop the weapon! Now!

13:58.000 --> 14:00.480
Kick the gun over to me.

14:01.320 --> 14:02.640
- Paul!
- Yeah?

14:02.720 --> 14:05.040
Get in here.

14:08.160 --> 14:10.560
Pick up that gun.

14:13.400 --> 14:16.320
My name is Jack Bauer. I am a federal agent.

14:16.400 --> 14:18.640
You should have helped stop the looting.

14:18.720 --> 14:21.280
You still have any rifles
or did they get them too?

14:21.360 --> 14:24.640
- Behind the counter, yeah.
- Show me.

14:28.320 --> 14:31.040
Look, we're the first to be hit
because we're Arabs.

14:31.120 --> 14:34.640
- We had nothing to do with what happened...
- Quiet. He doesn't care.

14:34.720 --> 14:41.240
Take what you need, but leave two guns. We
chased the looters once, but they'll be back.

14:41.320 --> 14:43.560
Just stay there.

14:52.040 --> 14:54.400
Give me the keys.

14:56.160 --> 14:58.480
What are you guys doing here?

14:58.560 --> 15:03.240
- We needed to take cover.
- What do you mean? Who's after you?

15:04.320 --> 15:06.720
It has to do with the terrorist attacks.

15:06.800 --> 15:09.840
I have evidence
that I need to get to the authorities.

15:09.920 --> 15:12.320
The men chasing us caused this blackout.

15:12.400 --> 15:15.800
They detonated a device
called an electromagnetic pulse bomb.

15:15.880 --> 15:18.760
It destroys electrical activity
within eight miles.

15:18.840 --> 15:24.800
So everything that's happened, the looting,
the blackout, it's all because of the terrorists?

15:24.880 --> 15:28.480
Yes, and the evidence that I have
can help prevent further attacks.

15:28.560 --> 15:31.480
Jack, the commandos
will be here any minute.

15:31.560 --> 15:35.600
- Commandos?
- He's right. You need to leave this store.

15:35.680 --> 15:38.640
Right now we're their target.
You're not safe here.

15:38.720 --> 15:42.120
- Why don't you leave? It's our store.
- If I had a choice, I would,

15:42.200 --> 15:44.760
but you have weapons and shelter.

15:44.840 --> 15:48.600
Right now there's no other place for us to be.

15:52.440 --> 15:55.160
Can I talk to my brother for a second?

15:56.240 --> 15:58.760
Stay where I can see you.

16:06.920 --> 16:08.000
What's the plan?

16:08.080 --> 16:13.440
CTU knows that we can't contact them. They
can view this area with satellite and infrared.

16:13.520 --> 16:17.280
McLennan-Forster's commandos
arrived in a military helicopter.

16:17.360 --> 16:20.000
CTU had to see that on satellite.

16:20.080 --> 16:22.640
If we can initiate a large-enough firefight,

16:22.720 --> 16:26.280
we can force their commandos
to communicate their positions.

16:26.360 --> 16:29.000
- And CTU will pick up the signal?
- Yes.

16:29.080 --> 16:33.440
So you want to engage the
McLennan-Forster army, just the two of us?

16:33.520 --> 16:35.800
We have a positional advantage.

16:35.880 --> 16:38.840
And we only have to hold down
till CTU gets here.

16:38.920 --> 16:41.360
...nothing, all right?
- All right.

16:41.440 --> 16:44.000
My brother and I talked about this.

16:45.440 --> 16:47.440
We're staying.

16:56.680 --> 17:00.080
I can't force you to leave your own property,

17:01.160 --> 17:03.400
but this is notjust a bunch of looters.

17:03.480 --> 17:07.359
This is a very dangerous situation.
I cannot guarantee your safety.

17:07.440 --> 17:12.920
You don't understand. For years we've been
blamed for the attacks by these terrorists.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.280
We grew up in this neighbourhood.

17:15.359 --> 17:17.240
This country is our home.

17:17.319 --> 17:23.319
If you're fighting the people who caused
today's bloodshed, then we'll help you.

17:37.040 --> 17:41.280
The president should stay in the air
at least another hour, if not longer.

17:41.360 --> 17:46.040
If he wants to speak to the nation,
he should do it from Air Force One.

17:46.120 --> 17:49.280
- Keep me informed.
- " Yes, sir."

17:51.880 --> 17:56.600
I have an update from the San Gabriel Island
meltdown. It's not as bad as we had feared.

17:56.680 --> 17:59.400
How you doing?

17:59.480 --> 18:02.080
Sit down.

18:06.440 --> 18:08.760
Any word from Jack or Paul?

18:09.640 --> 18:11.680
No.

18:11.760 --> 18:15.600
I can't imagine how hard this must be for you.

18:18.720 --> 18:21.400
There's something else, isn't there?

18:21.480 --> 18:23.560
A couple hours ago,

18:23.640 --> 18:29.080
when we thought that Paul was involved
with the attacks, Jack questioned him.

18:29.160 --> 18:31.760
And Paul has his pride, so he resisted, but...

18:31.840 --> 18:34.320
Jack was pretty rough?

18:34.400 --> 18:35.400
Very.

18:35.480 --> 18:38.360
That's his job.
He had to make sure.

18:42.240 --> 18:45.120
You have to believe that Jack had no choice.

18:45.200 --> 18:48.400
I know. I guess it was just a shock to see it.

18:50.680 --> 18:53.880
Somehow he seemed like a different person.

18:53.960 --> 18:56.880
We need people like that, Audrey.

18:58.400 --> 19:01.600
Jack is an incredible man. I just...

19:01.680 --> 19:05.080
But you're not sure you feel
the same way as before, is that it?

19:05.160 --> 19:07.480
Something like that.

19:27.040 --> 19:31.280
Can I speak to you for a moment?
It's important.

19:31.360 --> 19:34.720
OK. I don't have much time.

19:34.800 --> 19:38.120
You're aware I was falsely accused
of leaking information.

19:38.200 --> 19:42.000
- Yes, I saw the report.
- Erin Driscoll didn't talk to you about it?

19:42.080 --> 19:45.440
Her daughter died.
I think she has other things on her mind.

19:45.520 --> 19:49.720
I understand, but there are some things
that still need to be handled.

19:49.800 --> 19:50.800
What things?

19:50.880 --> 19:53.920
She promised that it would be expunged
from my record,

19:54.000 --> 19:58.160
and I'd be bumped up two pay grades,
so I want to make sure that will still happen.

19:58.240 --> 20:00.240
I'll look into it, but not today.

20:00.320 --> 20:03.720
What happened to me was an outrage.

20:03.800 --> 20:09.800
If you don't do something to resolve it
right now, I'll go directly to Secretary Heller.

20:11.360 --> 20:14.880
Secretary Heller doesn't run CTU.

20:14.960 --> 20:18.680
I do. And I am ordering you
to go back to work.

20:18.760 --> 20:24.880
Not until you assure me the false accusation
will be expunged and my pay grade changed.

20:31.360 --> 20:34.520
- I need security to station one.
- Security?

20:34.600 --> 20:36.560
What for?

20:38.000 --> 20:41.400
I need people whose minds are on theirjobs.
Yours isn't.

20:41.480 --> 20:45.520
So you're firing me? You can't.
You need me. I'm juggling active protocols.

20:45.600 --> 20:46.800
We'll manage.

20:46.880 --> 20:51.240
Please escort Ms Gavin out of the building.
Make sure you get her access card.

20:51.320 --> 20:55.000
You'll be sorry for this.
I promise you will.

21:30.760 --> 21:33.600
- Back entrance locked?
- Yeah.

21:33.680 --> 21:36.080
Put these in each window.
Have ammunition ready.

21:36.160 --> 21:42.160
And I want you to get two hunting vests.
Fill all the pockets with empty clips. Go.

21:48.240 --> 21:52.720
Ms Gavin won't be working with us any more.
I'll need you two to divide her workload.

21:52.800 --> 21:57.920
We're stretched pretty thin. Everyone is up to
their necks, or not qualified to replace Sarah.

21:58.000 --> 22:02.280
- You may want to reconsider.
- No. I don't trust her.

22:05.280 --> 22:08.640
Then what about Agent Almeida?

22:08.720 --> 22:15.040
Michelle, we could use the help,
and he's already proved himself useful today.

22:21.840 --> 22:25.440
Agent Almeida, please come to station six.

22:35.680 --> 22:36.800
Yeah.

22:36.880 --> 22:39.840
Work with Stiles and Manning
for the rest of the day.

22:39.920 --> 22:44.640
Edgar, call up Sarah's protocols. Check
the configuration, make sure they're accurate.

22:44.720 --> 22:48.520
- I'll advise internal stations of the change.
- " Give me an update.

22:48.600 --> 22:53.040
It's quiet except for emergency-vehicle
chatter. There's no sign of Jack or Paul.

22:53.120 --> 22:58.280
CTU teams are ready. All we can do is spread
them around the perimeter and wait for Jack.

22:58.360 --> 23:00.760
I think that's a mistake.

23:00.840 --> 23:04.480
We should consolidate our teams,
meet strength with strength.

23:04.560 --> 23:07.480
- Where would you place them?
- At McLennan-Forster.

23:07.920 --> 23:10.240
Jack won't be far from there.

23:10.320 --> 23:13.240
Look, he knows we won't be able
to find him without help.

23:13.320 --> 23:17.080
He's gonna help us by starting a firefight.
I know the way he thinks.

23:17.160 --> 23:21.440
The hostiles will break radio silence
when they attack. We can follow the signal.

23:21.520 --> 23:23.960
He's gonna engage
an entire team of commandos?

23:24.040 --> 23:29.320
It's the most efficient way to be found.
And he's gonna expect us to be ready for it.

23:29.400 --> 23:32.000
Stick with the plan. Cover the perimeter.

23:32.080 --> 23:34.480
Michelle.

23:34.560 --> 23:40.960
If we send all our teams to one location and
you're wrong, Jack and Paul won't survive.

23:41.480 --> 23:46.360
But if we cover the perimeter,
we may have a chance to save them.

23:47.800 --> 23:49.800
Do it.

23:54.280 --> 23:56.680
Castle, go ahead as planned.
Be ready to move.

24:05.360 --> 24:07.960
There's one of them.

24:08.040 --> 24:10.040
It's time.

24:13.680 --> 24:15.880
No one fires until I give the order.

24:15.960 --> 24:18.360
- OK.
- All right.

24:54.400 --> 24:57.000
Team leader, this is Spectre.
I was just shot at.

24:57.080 --> 25:00.760
I'm on the northwest corner of Stringer,
between Flower and Third.

25:00.840 --> 25:01.840
Copy that.

25:02.440 --> 25:05.560
- He's not returning fire.
- Because he's alone.

25:05.640 --> 25:07.920
He's calling for backup now.

25:08.000 --> 25:12.160
- And what do we do?
- Wait for them to come full force.

25:12.240 --> 25:15.000
Just stay ready.

25:17.960 --> 25:19.960
- Audrey.
- Yes?

25:20.040 --> 25:24.720
Let DOD know we're using law-enforcement
channels in the blackout zone.

25:24.800 --> 25:27.840
- I told them we might need their feeds.
- You don't need them?

25:27.920 --> 25:30.960
- No.
- All right, no problem.

25:35.440 --> 25:37.840
I didn't mean to be confrontational before.

25:37.920 --> 25:41.040
Just, when you walk into a hailstorm
you have to be decisive.

25:41.120 --> 25:43.880
I understand,
and I know where you're coming from.

25:43.960 --> 25:48.040
I think that you're making
the right decisions, but...

25:48.120 --> 25:49.560
But what?

25:49.640 --> 25:52.840
I think that you should
re-evaluate your opinion of Tony.

25:52.920 --> 25:56.360
- Why is that?
- This morning Jack had nowhere to turn.

25:56.440 --> 25:59.960
He went to the one person
he knew would come through for him - Tony.

26:00.040 --> 26:02.440
Tony saved our lives.

26:07.720 --> 26:10.800
- I didn't know.
- We had to spend a couple hours with him.

26:10.880 --> 26:14.200
It's true, Tony has a lot of issues,
but he is good at what he does.

26:14.280 --> 26:18.880
And I think that we could use him
on a day like today.

26:18.960 --> 26:21.520
Fair enough.

26:27.920 --> 26:30.480
And business aside,

26:30.560 --> 26:33.160
he still cares about you.

26:42.440 --> 26:45.200
I got those perimeter teams
you asked for ready to go.

26:45.280 --> 26:47.240
Thanks.

26:48.320 --> 26:52.760
Tony, look, I just want you to know that just
because I overruled you a few minutes ago

26:52.840 --> 26:55.920
doesn't mean that I don't value your input.

26:57.960 --> 27:00.240
Don't patronise me, Michelle.

27:00.320 --> 27:02.400
I'm not.

27:03.680 --> 27:06.920
Look, you ran CTU for two years.

27:07.000 --> 27:11.680
Anything that you have to say
I will consider seriously.

27:16.000 --> 27:22.000
Don't worry. I'm gonna tell you what I think
whether you want to hear it or not, all right?

27:23.480 --> 27:25.600
Good.

27:33.760 --> 27:36.440
You scared?

27:37.760 --> 27:40.800
- You sure you both want to do this?
- Yeah.

27:41.680 --> 27:45.080
My brother and I are more angry
about these attacks than you are.

27:45.160 --> 27:50.640
So we're gonna stand up and we're gonna
try to be part of the solution.

27:50.720 --> 27:54.400
- I'm sorry this had to happen in your store.
- Yeah.

27:55.480 --> 27:59.440
Our father left us this business
when he died.

27:59.520 --> 28:05.200
And he worked his whole life to make
a good name for himself in the community.

28:05.280 --> 28:07.280
This store is his legacy,

28:08.360 --> 28:11.040
but if he were here right now,

28:11.680 --> 28:14.360
he'd be standing next to you,

28:14.440 --> 28:17.160
just as we are.

28:21.640 --> 28:24.440
Just stay low and do what I tell you.

28:41.720 --> 28:43.800
Thank you...

28:44.840 --> 28:47.320
for saving my life.

28:49.600 --> 28:51.760
Yeah.

29:05.440 --> 29:08.000
They're here.

29:28.520 --> 29:33.320
Tony, Michelle said that you were doing
a search on ties to Marwan. May I help?

29:33.400 --> 29:36.200
- Do you have a sign-on for the SYKY server?
- In Washington?

29:36.280 --> 29:40.920
- Yeah, it would save me time on this search.
- Yeah.

29:43.160 --> 29:45.760
- There you go.
- Thanks.

29:47.160 --> 29:49.800
- Anything else?
- It should kick off a few names.

29:49.880 --> 29:54.560
You can help me write them down
once it's done searching.

29:57.640 --> 30:01.920
So... did you tell Michelle
what happened today?

30:02.000 --> 30:04.960
- I said that Jack called you.
- Anything else?

30:05.040 --> 30:09.280
I didn't say that you were living
with anyone, if that's what you mean.

30:09.360 --> 30:14.120
She probably already knows that,
and I'm sure she couldn't care less.

30:14.200 --> 30:19.600
So how are you and Jack faring
with him out in the field today?

30:20.680 --> 30:22.680
It's different.

30:24.080 --> 30:27.320
- A lot different than Washington.
- Yeah.

30:27.400 --> 30:29.560
It is different.

30:30.640 --> 30:36.240
To tell the truth, I couldn't believe it when
I heard that Jack had taken a deskjob in DC.

30:36.320 --> 30:39.160
He said he was happier this way.

30:39.240 --> 30:40.800
Uh-huh.

30:43.040 --> 30:46.800
Well, you've gotten a chance
to see him in both worlds today.

30:46.880 --> 30:48.960
Think he'll go back to wearing a suit?

30:49.040 --> 30:54.360
After the hell Jack's been through today,
you think he'd want to come back to this?

30:54.440 --> 30:57.440
Some people are more comfortable in hell.

30:57.520 --> 31:00.400
Are you talking about Jack...

31:00.480 --> 31:02.800
or yourself?

31:03.880 --> 31:06.480
I think we found them.

31:09.960 --> 31:12.960
Each signal is a radio,
all using the same frequency.

31:13.040 --> 31:14.560
They're planning an attack.

31:14.640 --> 31:18.240
They're at Flower and Third,
a quarter mile from McLennan-Forster.

31:18.320 --> 31:21.920
You were right.
He's actually drawing them in.

31:23.880 --> 31:26.360
" Go, go!

31:49.840 --> 31:53.920
A sporting goods store, across the street.

32:01.120 --> 32:03.040
Let's move.

32:03.120 --> 32:05.080
Bravo One, move in.

32:32.480 --> 32:35.520
" The spread's picking up
automatic-weapon fire.

32:35.600 --> 32:38.800
- When will our teams get there?
- The ground teams will arrive first.

32:38.880 --> 32:42.080
- When?
- At least five or six minutes.

32:55.920 --> 32:59.400
- Who's helping them?
- I don't know. They gotta be civilians.

32:59.480 --> 33:02.520
We need to end this and get that document.
Understood?

33:02.600 --> 33:06.040
- Yeah, I understand.
- Let's go.

33:13.840 --> 33:16.000
Hey, Naji! Hey!

33:16.080 --> 33:18.120
Hey, are you hit? Hey?

33:18.200 --> 33:20.080
You OK? Naji!

33:21.280 --> 33:24.200
It hit the clip.

33:26.160 --> 33:27.560
Naji.

33:31.240 --> 33:33.480
" Fall back!

33:42.440 --> 33:44.840
" All right! Now! Now!

33:48.440 --> 33:50.880
" Move forward!

34:03.600 --> 34:05.440
Hurry! Take my shotgun.

34:05.520 --> 34:08.440
Because of their night goggles,
if they get within ten feet,

34:08.520 --> 34:12.560
shine your flashlight in their eyes,
it'll blind them.

34:43.639 --> 34:45.760
" Jack?

34:45.840 --> 34:47.639
Jack?

34:49.280 --> 34:50.880
The gunfire's stopped.

34:50.960 --> 34:53.360
- Are the teams on site?
- Not yet.

34:53.440 --> 34:55.880
The commandos could have
taken over the location.

34:55.960 --> 34:58.640
They might have taken the information back.

34:58.720 --> 35:00.720
Try to get in touch with our teams.

35:00.800 --> 35:03.280
I'll update Division.

35:03.360 --> 35:09.080
If McLennan-Forster won the firefight,
what about Jack and Paul?

35:09.160 --> 35:11.600
There's no way to tell.

35:26.160 --> 35:30.640
- CTU personnel are approaching the location.
- "It's Castle. We're about to engage."

35:30.720 --> 35:34.000
- How many hostiles?
- "Six down outside. Unknown inside."

35:34.080 --> 35:37.720
- Lee, it's Tony. Are Jack and Paul alive?
- "Unknown at this point."

35:37.800 --> 35:41.920
The hostiles cannot leave
with the information from McLennan-Forster.

35:42.000 --> 35:43.960
- You understand?
- "We'll do our best."

35:44.040 --> 35:49.320
No. Listen. Failure is not an option. That
information is what this whole thing's about.

35:49.400 --> 35:51.120
Roger that.

36:43.760 --> 36:46.440
- " Jack!
- Yeah? I'm here.

36:46.520 --> 36:48.120
- You safe?
- Yeah.

36:48.200 --> 36:50.920
- All hostiles are down. We're clear.
- OK.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.160
" Go ahead.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
This way.

36:59.920 --> 37:02.440
- This is Castle. Get me CTU.
- " Stand by."

37:04.680 --> 37:06.600
- Curtis.
- "It's Castle."

37:06.680 --> 37:10.440
- Lee, what's your status?
- Location secured. Jack and Raines are safe.

37:10.520 --> 37:13.720
- What about their information?
- Unknown at this point.

37:13.800 --> 37:17.160
Keep this line open.
Jack's OK. The team secured the store.

37:17.240 --> 37:19.120
- What about Paul?
- He's with him.

37:19.200 --> 37:23.280
- Has he anything from McLennan-Forster?
- We don't know yet.

37:23.360 --> 37:26.280
Stay in touch.
Whatever they get, be ready to work up.

37:26.360 --> 37:29.160
You got it.

37:31.320 --> 37:32.320
" Yeah?

37:32.400 --> 37:36.240
- " You want us to help process?"
- No. We'll do it when we sift the data.

37:36.320 --> 37:38.440
- " Sure that's not a problem?"
- Yeah.

37:38.520 --> 37:43.280
- "All right. We'll wait for your confirmation."
- Yeah. OK.

37:43.360 --> 37:46.640
- Jack and Paul are OK.
- What about the information?

37:46.720 --> 37:51.880
We don't know. Even if Jack has it, we don't
know that it'll bring us any closer to Marwan.

37:51.960 --> 37:55.080
McLennan-Forster's involvement
should yield some leads.

37:55.160 --> 37:59.400
That will have to be worked up here. Their
computers were knocked out by the EMP.

37:59.480 --> 38:01.800
You want to head that up?

38:01.880 --> 38:07.440
No. You know what?
You should probably let Curtis handle that.

38:07.520 --> 38:09.840
All right, I will.

38:13.560 --> 38:17.600
I shouldn't have said that earlier
about your drinking. I was out of line.

38:17.680 --> 38:19.680
I'm sorry.

38:21.360 --> 38:24.280
You don't owe me an apology.

38:27.320 --> 38:29.920
My life right now...

38:31.760 --> 38:35.040
Let's just say that I've been better.

38:35.120 --> 38:40.120
Quite frankly, seeing you here today
has only made things worse.

38:44.600 --> 38:48.680
Look, I'm gonna leave, get out of your hair
and let you do yourjob, all right?

38:48.760 --> 38:50.560
No.

38:55.040 --> 38:57.440
We can't afford to lose you.

38:57.520 --> 38:59.600
Not today.

38:59.680 --> 39:02.040
You're sure?

39:02.120 --> 39:03.920
Yes.

39:07.120 --> 39:09.600
Yes, I'm sure.

39:12.240 --> 39:14.240
All right.

39:33.760 --> 39:36.560
I'll make sure you get help
putting the store together.

39:36.640 --> 39:39.480
I appreciate that.

39:39.560 --> 39:41.560
Thank you.

39:42.960 --> 39:45.000
Thank you.

40:00.480 --> 40:04.160
Lee, I need you to get this to CTU.
It needs to get decoded immediately.

40:04.240 --> 40:08.600
Set up a detail, five of your best men.
Nothing happens to this store. Understand?

40:09.040 --> 40:11.280
Jack, look out!

40:16.960 --> 40:18.920
Paul?

40:19.000 --> 40:22.920
Paul? Paul! Medic!

40:23.000 --> 40:26.440
Come on. Just stay with me.
Come on, Paul, stay with me.

40:26.520 --> 40:30.000
No, no. Paul! Paul, stay with me.
Come on, look at me. Look at me.

40:30.080 --> 40:33.000
There you go. Look at me.

40:34.280 --> 40:35.720
I owed you.

40:35.800 --> 40:38.280
You don't owe me anything.
Just stay with me.

40:38.360 --> 40:41.280
" Jack, it's OK. The medic's here.

40:45.120 --> 40:48.040
Jack, let the medics do their work.

41:08.000 --> 41:11.760
- Any problems?
- No, I'm here.

41:11.840 --> 41:14.400
- Are we on schedule?
- Yes.

41:14.480 --> 41:16.600
- What about you?
- I'm leaving now.

41:17.040 --> 41:23.040
The President of the United States
is on a tight schedule. We can't be late.
