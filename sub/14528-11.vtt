Never mind, what do you want?

20:01.059 --> 20:03.311
Okay, listen, so I know
you've been super busy,

20:03.311 --> 20:06.064
and I was wondering if
you might need a co-captain.

20:06.064 --> 20:07.023
No way.

20:07.023 --> 20:08.107
Oh, okay.

20:08.107 --> 20:12.153
You know, just between
juggling Caleb and Eddie...

20:12.153 --> 20:13.654
What are you talking about?

20:13.654 --> 20:17.325
Oh, you know, after
your kiss with Caleb.

20:17.325 --> 20:21.412
Yeah, I heard you guys
talking at Underground.

20:21.412 --> 20:23.664
I sure hope Eddie
doesn't find out.

20:23.664 --> 20:26.501
Um, I'll talk
to Ceci about it.

20:26.501 --> 20:31.172
And I also...

20:31.172 --> 20:33.841
How am I gonna
tell the Bomb Squad?

20:33.841 --> 20:36.010
You got a new gig,
with benefits.

20:36.010 --> 20:37.470
It's great,
they'll understand.

20:37.470 --> 20:40.056
Eh, I don't know,
especially when they're...

20:40.056 --> 20:41.766
Come on, look,
you're gonna love it.

20:41.766 --> 20:43.267
I'm jealous.

20:43.267 --> 20:45.144
I hate my job.

20:45.144 --> 20:46.979
You know what?

20:46.979 --> 20:48.481
Screw Bro.

20:48.481 --> 20:50.525
I should just quit.

20:50.525 --> 20:53.569
No, being unemployed sucks.

20:53.569 --> 20:56.197
Where would you go?

20:56.197 --> 20:58.199
♪

20:58.199 --> 21:02.370
Hardworking Americans are
paying for medical programs

21:02.370 --> 21:05.373
that are benefiting
Mexican illegals

21:05.373 --> 21:08.042
and all their anchor babies.

21:08.042 --> 21:09.544
Stop using taxpayer money...

21:09.544 --> 21:10.837
Oh, hey!

21:10.837 --> 21:11.963
...to pay for immigrants

21:11.963 --> 21:14.799
who are putting
a drain on the middle class

21:14.799 --> 21:17.677
and stealing our jobs.

21:17.677 --> 21:21.139
That's right,
I said illegals,

21:21.139 --> 21:23.641
because I don't speak
politically correct

21:23.641 --> 21:27.061
like all those crazy liberals.

21:27.061 --> 21:28.563
As the next president,

21:28.563 --> 21:30.231
I will do everything
in my power

21:30.231 --> 21:32.900
to restore this
country to greatness

21:32.900 --> 21:36.070
by closing our borders
and protecting the lives

21:36.070 --> 21:38.281
of unborn children.

21:38.281 --> 21:40.366
Under my administration,

21:40.366 --> 21:42.994
I will say no to Mexico,

21:42.994 --> 21:45.663
and yes to America.

21:45.663 --> 21:47.623
This is KOC News,
Tucson, Arizona.

21:47.623 --> 21:49.417
I'm Sarah Joyce Meyer
with Houston, Texas.

21:49.417 --> 21:52.378
This is Randy Lee Ames,
Radio Lansing, Michigan.

21:52.378 --> 21:54.505
Presidential candidate
Tim Wallace has become

21:54.505 --> 21:55.923
a media phenomenon.

21:55.923 --> 21:57.675
He's constantly trashing
Mexicans, Latinos.

21:57.675 --> 22:00.178
Wallace is just saying what
everyone else is afraid to say.

22:00.178 --> 22:02.263
He said that all
Mexicans are criminals.

22:02.263 --> 22:03.681
Someone needs to
remind Tim Wallace

22:03.681 --> 22:05.308
that hate speech
is not protected

22:05.308 --> 22:06.267
by the First Amendment,

22:06.267 --> 22:08.269
and hate is not
an American value.

22:08.269 --> 22:09.505
(glass shattering)
