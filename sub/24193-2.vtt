WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:08.175
THIS PROGRAM IS LOOSELY
BASED ON ACTUAL EVENTS.

00:08.258 --> 00:10.969
CHARACTERS AND EVENTS WERE
ADAPTED FOR DRAMATIC EFFECT.

00:17.142 --> 00:20.979
SOCIAL SECURITY

00:27.861 --> 00:29.738
Number 47!

00:30.614 --> 00:32.448
José Aparício.

00:35.035 --> 00:36.495
Identification card.

00:37.079 --> 00:38.497
Social security card.

00:39.915 --> 00:41.708
Work record.

00:49.299 --> 00:51.134
Employment identification number.

00:52.552 --> 00:54.388
Proof of residence.

00:54.888 --> 00:56.974
Is it recent?

00:57.683 --> 00:58.517
Yes.

01:00.000 --> 01:06.074

01:07.985 --> 01:10.153
Were you collecting disability benefits?

01:12.072 --> 01:12.948
No.

01:15.033 --> 01:18.328
But it says here, "retirement
due to mental illness."

01:20.205 --> 01:23.083
Is it a recent diagnosis?

01:24.584 --> 01:26.586
It must be. I didn't even know about it.

01:27.671 --> 01:31.258
- Did you bring the medical report?
- Excuse me?

01:31.383 --> 01:34.720
Medical proof that you
are unable to work.

01:40.392 --> 01:41.518
Well...

01:43.729 --> 01:47.524
as far as being crazy or not...

01:48.150 --> 01:51.903
If I am crazy, it's not my
job to prove that I'm crazy.

01:52.738 --> 01:57.034
Whoever said that I'm crazy
needs to prove that.

01:57.409 --> 02:00.454
To have your case processed,
you need a medical report.

02:00.537 --> 02:03.248
Otherwise you won't receive
financial assistance.

02:03.332 --> 02:06.877
I just broke two fingers
from my already broken hand

02:06.960 --> 02:08.794
in front of my daughter.

02:09.128 --> 02:13.133
I can wreck your office. Will
that help me get the money?

02:14.843 --> 02:17.638
I'm sorry, but I require
a medical report.

02:22.643 --> 02:24.603
Twenty years as a police officer.

02:25.187 --> 02:26.938
What did he get out of it?

02:27.981 --> 02:28.940
Nothing.

02:29.107 --> 02:32.110
You suffer from BPAD.

02:33.320 --> 02:34.529
BPAD? What's that?

02:36.573 --> 02:38.367
Bipolar affective disorder.

02:40.452 --> 02:43.288
He used to dream of arresting
corrupt politicians.

02:43.664 --> 02:47.209
Now he gets welfare from a
government run by them.

02:49.294 --> 02:52.255
My last mood swing was when
they released Ibrahim.

02:52.339 --> 02:54.716
- Who is Ibrahim?
- A cancer.

02:55.592 --> 02:56.843
I don't get it.

02:57.052 --> 02:58.428
You don't need to.

03:00.055 --> 03:02.265
Just hand me the fucking report.

03:13.068 --> 03:14.403
What's the amount?

03:16.530 --> 03:18.740
Two thousand, nine hundred and fifty.

03:20.659 --> 03:23.703
Two thousand, nine
hundred and fifty reais?

03:24.371 --> 03:25.205
Yes.

03:27.457 --> 03:30.377
My daughter has special needs.

03:31.545 --> 03:34.464
Are there any additional
benefits for that?

03:34.548 --> 03:35.674
Yes, sure.

03:35.757 --> 03:38.093
If so, your case would
need to be reviewed.

03:38.176 --> 03:40.721
You would have to bring your
daughter to be examined,

03:40.804 --> 03:44.141
re-submit all the paperwork, and
then it all goes to Brasília.

03:48.145 --> 03:49.104
Brasília.

03:50.772 --> 03:52.441
Check if he's armed.

03:55.736 --> 03:57.529
- OK, send him up.
- Who is it?

03:58.572 --> 03:59.614
Guess who.

04:02.868 --> 04:05.454
First, he was disgusted
by his own destiny.

04:09.583 --> 04:10.459
How may I help you?

04:10.584 --> 04:15.172
Then he suffered a chronic inability
to let his past go and move on.

04:16.839 --> 04:17.882
Welcome, dear friend.

04:22.179 --> 04:23.847
What can I do for you?

04:30.353 --> 04:34.483
Lastly, there was the longing to
take the law into his own hands.

04:35.525 --> 04:38.820
How much does he make per month
fueling political parties?

04:39.488 --> 04:40.405
Two, three million?

04:49.289 --> 04:50.373
My pension.

04:50.457 --> 04:52.334
That's what I make per month.

05:00.425 --> 05:02.260
That's 2,950 reais.

05:05.138 --> 05:08.892
Ruffo, I think you're here for a reason.

05:08.975 --> 05:09.810
Am I right?

05:15.357 --> 05:17.943
Sometimes I want to put
a bullet in your face.

05:19.528 --> 05:20.612
I know.

05:21.696 --> 05:23.490
But that's not you, right?

05:23.990 --> 05:26.117
Ruffo endured it all.

05:33.083 --> 05:38.129
What fucked him up was the humiliation
of facing defeat in front of his family.

05:47.806 --> 05:51.017
And his inability to do what he wanted:

05:54.521 --> 05:56.731
put a bullet in Ibrahim's head.

06:00.902 --> 06:03.572
No one fights cancer
and gets away with it.

06:03.947 --> 06:04.948
No one.

06:05.615 --> 06:07.033
Least of all Ruffo.

06:19.212 --> 06:21.423
Regina often complained about Ruffo,

06:21.506 --> 06:23.300
but deep inside she believed in him.

06:24.384 --> 06:26.720
She believed he would turn things around.

06:32.267 --> 06:34.102
To me, it was a huge defeat.

06:44.446 --> 06:46.448
Dimas told me, but I
had to see for myself.

06:49.200 --> 06:52.829
If the plea bargain works, you're good
with it. If not, that's fine too?

06:52.912 --> 06:54.289
Yes, that's right, Verena.

06:54.623 --> 06:56.499
Too bad Ibrahim didn't say shit!

06:56.583 --> 06:58.001
It was our bet.

06:58.293 --> 06:59.169
What bet?

06:59.544 --> 07:02.255
- We did everything we could.
- We lost the "bet."

07:02.714 --> 07:04.132
We lost Ruffo.

07:04.716 --> 07:06.593
Sometimes we lose, Verena.

07:08.678 --> 07:09.512
Cláudio.

07:14.267 --> 07:15.143
What about us?

07:16.811 --> 07:17.687
What about us?

07:18.396 --> 07:19.689
It didn't mean anything?

07:21.316 --> 07:22.651
What do you want me to do?

07:23.193 --> 07:25.654
You packed your bags, Cláudio.
Is it over?

07:25.737 --> 07:26.905
Should we insist on it?

07:27.197 --> 07:28.698
Going away is a cowardly act.

07:29.032 --> 07:30.200
What do you want?

07:30.867 --> 07:33.787
That I stay here and pay
for Ruffo's fuck-up?

07:35.288 --> 07:36.748
That's what you do.

07:37.499 --> 07:38.541
I'm out.

07:47.300 --> 07:52.597
My mentor was fucked, and the
man I loved didn't give a damn.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.684
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

08:36.558 --> 08:38.018
Ten years later.

08:38.727 --> 08:40.477
The Lebanese was back in the game...

08:41.563 --> 08:43.231
and I wasn't going to let it slide.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.025
FEDERAL JUSTICE

08:49.404 --> 08:52.907
It was Verena Cardoni
versus Roberto Ibrahim.

08:53.074 --> 08:55.118
- Good evening, Verena.
- Evening, Liana.

08:55.201 --> 08:56.828
Judge Rigo is busy.

08:59.372 --> 09:01.082
There was only one problem.

09:02.042 --> 09:06.504
To get that son of a bitch, I
needed Rigo to lend a hand.

09:07.338 --> 09:08.256
May I come in?

09:10.216 --> 09:12.260
You already did, Verena. It's OK, Liana.

09:14.054 --> 09:16.181
Is Roberto Ibrahim's case already closed?

09:16.723 --> 09:19.726
No, that will happen in two months or so.

09:20.268 --> 09:21.853
OK. Can it be closed?

09:22.604 --> 09:25.648
- Why? Is he at it again?
- Yeah, full force.

09:25.732 --> 09:27.817
- I need to tap his phone.
- That's impossible.

09:27.901 --> 09:31.446
- I'll arrest him if he broke his plea.
- If you do that, we can't investigate.

09:32.280 --> 09:34.949
Rigo, we know Ibrahim is not
a common currency dealer.

09:35.700 --> 09:37.077
We owe it to Ruffo.

09:38.620 --> 09:40.288
I played on his weak spot.

09:40.789 --> 09:42.957
I appealed to his guilt.

09:45.001 --> 09:46.503
But it wouldn't be easy.

09:47.462 --> 09:52.133
To begin with, Roberval became Paraná's
police headquarters superintendent.

09:53.468 --> 09:54.886
Not trustworthy.

09:57.639 --> 10:01.101
Besides, our staff was minimal.
Me and one other person.

10:01.559 --> 10:03.228
- Vander?
- Yes.

10:03.311 --> 10:07.023
Can you get me Chebab's
bank statements, please?

10:07.107 --> 10:08.191
I have them here.

10:09.067 --> 10:12.612
Vander was born in a favela in Rio.
He's street-smart.

10:13.321 --> 10:14.948
But lacked experience.

10:16.241 --> 10:20.036
I couldn't proceed with an operation
that size with just a rookie.

10:22.038 --> 10:23.706
Can you sort through them for me?

10:26.835 --> 10:28.336
I had to ask for back-up.

10:29.087 --> 10:31.381
Roberval came to me
with a crazy-ass story.

10:31.756 --> 10:35.051
He said that some hick had volunteered.

10:38.680 --> 10:39.514
Fuck.

10:40.390 --> 10:41.516
Good morning.

10:42.058 --> 10:43.351
May I help you, sir?

10:44.602 --> 10:45.854
Agent Verena Cardoni?

10:46.771 --> 10:47.647
Yes.

10:47.730 --> 10:49.732
Federal Agent Luís Carlos Guilhome.

10:49.816 --> 10:52.110
I'm here to join the
Financial Crime Division.

10:53.027 --> 10:56.072
- If possible.
- OK. Where are you coming from?

10:56.197 --> 10:57.031
Rondônia.

11:00.034 --> 11:01.870
Rondônia. OK.

11:01.953 --> 11:04.330
Make yourself comfortable.
Leave your stuff here.

11:04.414 --> 11:05.248
Excuse me.

11:05.331 --> 11:06.583
This is agent Vander.

11:07.625 --> 11:08.459
Nice to meet you.

11:08.543 --> 11:10.378
He's been working with me.

11:10.962 --> 11:13.506
Now it's just the three of
us in Operation Jet Wash.

11:13.590 --> 11:14.799
You came at a good time.

11:17.468 --> 11:20.597
If you're good with numbers,
it will be helpful.

11:20.680 --> 11:25.184
Here are all bank statements from
Solidez Contractor, K.W. Cons.

11:25.268 --> 11:27.812
PGD Invest and TOZ Software.

11:28.188 --> 11:30.231
We need to find the
origin of these deposits

11:30.315 --> 11:32.942
to figure out what the
currency dealer is laundering.

11:35.028 --> 11:37.572
Take your time. It's a whole lot.

11:38.531 --> 11:39.991
One more thing.

11:40.116 --> 11:43.536
When you're done, don't input
the data in our system, OK?

11:44.370 --> 11:45.914
Show me your report first.

11:46.831 --> 11:47.665
Just to me.

11:50.084 --> 11:51.544
That's it. Could you help him?

11:52.003 --> 11:52.921
Welcome.

11:53.463 --> 11:54.297
Thank you.

11:57.175 --> 11:58.259
Just to her?

11:59.427 --> 12:00.303
Anything wrong?

12:00.887 --> 12:03.181
Never mind. Let's move on.

12:03.264 --> 12:06.017
You like numbers, right?
Because we've got numbers.

12:07.018 --> 12:07.852
Numbers.

12:09.312 --> 12:10.438
Operation Jet Wash?

12:15.360 --> 12:17.779
- Do you need a calculator?
- No, I don't, thanks.

12:21.491 --> 12:25.036
While I was getting fucked over,
Ibrahim was enjoying the high life.

12:25.453 --> 12:29.499
The son-of-a-bitch ratted every currency
dealer and was all alone in the market.

12:29.582 --> 12:31.626
RIO DE JANEIRO PETROBRASIL HEADQUARTERS

12:31.709 --> 12:34.253
He made friends with a guy
named João Pedro Rangel,

12:34.337 --> 12:37.507
CEO of Petrobrasil, the biggest
state-owned company in the country.

12:37.590 --> 12:38.424
What's up, Pepê?

12:38.675 --> 12:41.469
I gave the campaign 600 grand.
I need to cover it.

12:43.554 --> 12:44.514
What does he want?

12:47.058 --> 12:48.810
We need to make him smile, right?

12:50.228 --> 12:51.813
There was always a project for him.

12:52.897 --> 12:56.234
Apparently, there's some slack on
Antônio and Lima's budget, right?

12:56.317 --> 12:58.945
Antônio and Lima? Can't help you there.

12:59.028 --> 13:00.738
We already went too far on that one.

13:01.280 --> 13:02.365
Of course not, Pepê.

13:02.448 --> 13:04.200
There's still a lot to be done there.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.788
Let's make it worth your while.

13:10.373 --> 13:13.960
Thirty-five years doing this.
It's time I retired.

13:14.377 --> 13:16.129
- Soon enough.
- You can handle it.

13:16.504 --> 13:18.548
You know the deal. You can do it.

13:18.631 --> 13:20.341
I'm not as classy as you, Pepê.

13:23.886 --> 13:26.472
It will be tough for me to
go to São Paulo this week.

13:26.681 --> 13:27.890
I think you'll like it.

13:28.266 --> 13:30.727
Together they operated bribery schemes

13:30.810 --> 13:33.730
within state-owned companies
for their allied politicians.

13:38.067 --> 13:40.945
Miller & Bretch was the biggest
contractor in the country.

13:41.029 --> 13:43.072
And like any other big construction firm,

13:43.156 --> 13:45.033
it was deeply involved in the scheme.

13:47.326 --> 13:49.370
João Pedro Rangel was a master

13:49.454 --> 13:52.290
at bridging politicians
with the private sector.

13:52.373 --> 13:55.960
Good. We solved the logistical problems.

13:56.044 --> 13:59.672
There's a suitable
loophole under Item 2578B.

13:59.756 --> 14:01.632
Gomes did his homework. For example...

14:02.592 --> 14:05.428
- Foundation piles.
- And metal structures.

14:07.013 --> 14:08.806
How can we justify that?

14:09.140 --> 14:10.475
Soil moisture!

14:10.558 --> 14:13.144
Moisture, in Pernambuco?
It's a fucking desert.

14:14.228 --> 14:16.189
Say the soil is soft. Whatever.

14:16.272 --> 14:20.193
It's a matter of semantics. How
about, "Soil resistance...

14:21.152 --> 14:23.738
at the refinery construction site...

14:24.489 --> 14:28.034
was lower than that indicated
in the original project,

14:28.117 --> 14:30.703
with substantial indication of soft soil

14:30.787 --> 14:32.663
and excessive moisture."

14:32.747 --> 14:35.583
"According to the auditors."
Always the auditors.

14:35.666 --> 14:37.293
And conclude like we always do.

14:37.377 --> 14:40.630
"Therefore, the quantity of
foundation piles and metal..."

14:40.713 --> 14:43.257
That makes 18 amendments.
That's enough, isn't it?

14:44.050 --> 14:45.843
- Gentlemen.
- This is Ricardo Bretch.

14:45.927 --> 14:48.262
I spoke to Gomes. We'll
review the percentage.

14:48.346 --> 14:52.183
The Nobleman, heir and
CEO of the company.

14:52.266 --> 14:56.354
The campaign barely started and
we're being hit from all sides.

14:56.437 --> 14:59.440
He paid bribes, but always
bitched about the amounts.

14:59.524 --> 15:01.526
Want to save money? Give it to Janete.

15:01.609 --> 15:02.944
This election is in the bag.

15:03.027 --> 15:06.364
Nobody can predict the next one. We
always contribute to both sides.

15:06.447 --> 15:08.074
Family policy.

15:08.866 --> 15:11.160
Add in the amount for the amendments

15:11.244 --> 15:14.163
and together we can review
the campaign contribution.

15:14.747 --> 15:16.624
I'm not authorized to deal with that.

15:16.707 --> 15:20.336
I'll talk to the people who are.
I'm just letting you know.

15:20.795 --> 15:22.296
If you are going to negotiate,

15:22.380 --> 15:25.508
I'll ask you to review the policy
of depositing only overseas,

15:25.591 --> 15:27.051
It won't happen.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.477
When should we schedule our next meeting?

15:36.561 --> 15:37.979
I'll call you to schedule it.

15:43.109 --> 15:45.736
Is this the Nobleman father,
or the grandfather?

15:45.820 --> 15:48.531
This is the Nobleman
father-of-the-whole-shebang.

15:48.781 --> 15:51.576
Once, he was at a governor's
inauguration ceremony.

15:51.659 --> 15:53.494
The governor met him and said,

15:53.578 --> 15:56.539
"Good to see you here," and
Grandpa Nobleman replied,

15:56.789 --> 16:01.043
"I'm always here, Governor.
You're the ones who come and go."

16:01.419 --> 16:02.253
Got it?

16:03.796 --> 16:06.340
- You're terrible at telling jokes.
- "You come and go."

16:06.424 --> 16:08.759
- Stop telling jokes.
- It's not a joke.

16:11.220 --> 16:13.431
Hey, Pepê, did the
carpet match the drapes?

16:13.514 --> 16:16.267
She's called Cinthia and
she studies Architecture.

16:16.350 --> 16:18.644
I'll bring you more exotic
material next week.

16:18.728 --> 16:21.397
- Yumi. You'll like her.
- I'm going to miss my flight.

16:21.481 --> 16:23.816
Samira is going to bust my sac.

16:25.067 --> 16:27.320
Bust your what? Your sac?

16:29.655 --> 16:31.491
- You should stay, Pepê.
- No.

16:31.574 --> 16:34.911
Kitano is delivering the money
and she never comes alone.

16:36.329 --> 16:39.916
She's like a Cracker Jack box.
There's always a surprise.

16:41.375 --> 16:42.668
Look. See that?

16:43.294 --> 16:44.712
Look at that car.

16:45.087 --> 16:46.881
- The Defender?
- No, the Evoque.

16:46.964 --> 16:48.174
The Evoque?

16:49.133 --> 16:50.551
That car is badass.

16:51.385 --> 16:52.220
Let's buy it.

16:53.262 --> 16:55.598
- Are you nuts?
- You'll miss the flight anyway.

16:56.265 --> 16:59.393
- Juliano, make a U-turn.
- Are you serious?

16:59.477 --> 17:01.646
Pepê, you work a lot. You deserve it.

17:02.522 --> 17:05.107
- A gentleman like you.
- I actually do.

17:07.902 --> 17:09.194
Let's think it over.

17:09.819 --> 17:12.114
Think again.

17:12.573 --> 17:13.782
You deserve it.

17:17.328 --> 17:20.330
- How much to bulletproof it?
- No need.

17:20.414 --> 17:21.999
Rio is such a safe place.

17:22.625 --> 17:25.002
- Bulletproof it.
- There's no need.

17:25.086 --> 17:26.337
I recommend doing it.

17:26.420 --> 17:29.757
Wait. Can I take this one right here?

17:30.633 --> 17:32.802
- What? Are you driving to Rio?
- Yes. Why not?

17:32.885 --> 17:34.512
- Grab and go.
- You're nuts, Pepê.

17:34.595 --> 17:37.139
Do you have one with beige leather seats?

17:37.223 --> 17:39.809
- Certainly. I have it in stock.
- There you go.

17:40.393 --> 17:42.228
Ibrahim mastered his art.

17:43.271 --> 17:44.730
He's quite excited.

17:44.814 --> 17:48.568
Loureiro, can he take the car now?
Paid in full.

17:48.651 --> 17:50.903
Ibrahim, you're the boss here.

17:51.153 --> 17:51.988
How much?

17:52.071 --> 17:54.490
But political campaigning
is always chaotic

17:54.574 --> 17:56.784
and sometimes even he
would leave a trail.

17:56.867 --> 17:59.245
In full, I can let it go for 251 grand.

17:59.829 --> 18:03.583
So it's 251. Where I'm from,
we write it like this.

18:03.666 --> 18:09.839
"Two hundred... and fifty one...

18:09.922 --> 18:11.674
thousand reais."

18:11.757 --> 18:13.342
Eager to impress JPR,

18:13.968 --> 18:15.094
he fucked up.

18:15.386 --> 18:19.098
It's under Mr. João Pedro's name and
under Mr. Ibrahim's address, correct?

18:19.181 --> 18:20.516
We live together.

18:21.225 --> 18:23.603
- What the fuck? Are you nuts?
- Come on, sweetie.

18:24.270 --> 18:26.772
- Stupid joke.
- Loureiro is one of us.

18:27.857 --> 18:28.983
Bad fucking luck.

18:30.943 --> 18:33.821
Screwed up, right when Rigo
approved the operation

18:33.904 --> 18:37.116
and I started investigating
currency dealers' accounts.

18:41.287 --> 18:42.663
Stupid.

18:43.372 --> 18:44.665
You didn't go to school.

18:45.207 --> 18:47.293
No right to complain.

18:47.501 --> 18:50.921
Ibrahim had the brilliant idea of
combining business with pleasure.

18:51.255 --> 18:54.800
He brought a former pimp onboard, Kitano.

18:55.468 --> 18:57.720
You see? See how much trouble you are?

18:57.803 --> 19:01.641
He used her prostitutes to distribute
laundered money throughout Brasília.

19:01.724 --> 19:05.269
Next time, buy decent tape, Juliano.

19:05.353 --> 19:07.313
This one is ruining her skin.

19:08.272 --> 19:09.982
What a night!

19:10.566 --> 19:12.652
While I was investigating,

19:13.778 --> 19:15.780
JPR was enjoying his new car.

19:24.455 --> 19:26.916
And Ibrahim was receiving
cash from the Nobleman.

19:26.999 --> 19:29.335
A happy ending for everyone.

20:02.576 --> 20:04.578
NEW VEHICLE SALE JOÃO PEDRO RANGEL

20:25.933 --> 20:28.602
At the end of that night,
only Ibrahim came.

20:32.356 --> 20:35.609
But I was the one who was
ready to fuck with them all.

20:59.717 --> 21:03.179
Hey, gorgeous! Want a ride to the pool?

21:03.929 --> 21:05.473
Whose car is this, João Pedro?

21:05.556 --> 21:08.309
Come check it out, babe.
It's something else!

21:08.392 --> 21:10.853
Something else? Where
did you get this car?

21:11.437 --> 21:12.521
It was a gift.

21:13.522 --> 21:15.816
A gift from whom?

21:16.400 --> 21:17.485
From Ibrahim.

21:17.568 --> 21:21.071
I didn't want to take it. I had
no choice. Ibrahim insisted.

21:21.155 --> 21:22.907
He paid cash, right?

21:23.616 --> 21:24.700
No, he paid by check.

21:25.326 --> 21:26.827
Damn, João Pedro.

21:26.911 --> 21:28.996
Registered under whose name?

21:29.079 --> 21:30.039
Mine.

21:32.208 --> 21:33.375
And the receipt?

21:35.294 --> 21:36.253
Mine.

21:41.634 --> 21:43.385
Should I return it?

21:47.139 --> 21:49.683
You shouldn't have accepted it.

21:53.270 --> 21:56.440
But I like this beige leather so much...

21:57.399 --> 21:59.568
You knew that, right?

21:59.652 --> 22:02.988
Come on in, honey. Let me
drive you to the pool.

22:05.032 --> 22:06.992
Let's go. Are you ready?

22:07.827 --> 22:09.328
Do you know how to back up?

22:10.037 --> 22:11.664
- Got it?
- I'm getting it.

22:12.289 --> 22:14.959
It drives like a spaceship.

22:32.726 --> 22:34.311
- Look.
- What is it?

22:35.688 --> 22:38.607
A receipt for a car
costing 250,000 reais.

22:38.691 --> 22:40.776
Look at the name. "João Pedro Rangel."

22:40.859 --> 22:42.778
- Do you know him?
- João Pedro? No.

22:43.237 --> 22:46.907
- He's Petrobrasil's CEO.
- Are you kidding? So, what now?

22:46.991 --> 22:49.118
Why is this receipt on Ibrahim's email?

22:49.493 --> 22:50.911
On Ibrahim's email?

22:53.789 --> 22:54.957
JET WASH TASK FORCE

22:55.040 --> 22:57.167
This is everything we were hoping for.

23:05.634 --> 23:07.761
CONTRACTOR SOLIDEZ

23:09.221 --> 23:10.222
What's this?

23:14.184 --> 23:17.187
All the money that went through
Ibrahim's accounts recently.

23:17.271 --> 23:21.525
It turned out the hick was
an accounting genius.

23:23.777 --> 23:25.988
I know, it's full of gaps,

23:26.071 --> 23:28.365
but I need more authorization
to complete it.

23:28.449 --> 23:30.159
I'm taking it to the Prosecutor.

23:30.242 --> 23:32.828
- But it's missing some stuff.
- It's enough for me.

23:32.911 --> 23:35.122
Sort it out. I want to take this quickly.

23:35.205 --> 23:36.081
Right.

23:36.665 --> 23:37.875
IBRAHIM'S SCHEME

23:38.125 --> 23:39.043
Take a look at this.

23:41.462 --> 23:43.047
Nice car!

23:45.633 --> 23:47.551
The tide was turning in my favor.

23:48.135 --> 23:50.012
So I decided to dive in.

23:51.138 --> 23:54.600
We found deposits for 4.8 million
dollars from the IOV contractor

23:54.683 --> 23:56.060
between March and August 2013.

23:56.602 --> 23:59.938
For 5.5 million from Garcez Netto,
4.2 million from Prosperminas,

24:00.314 --> 24:02.066
and 3.2 million from Estruturax.

24:02.149 --> 24:04.485
All deposited to Ibrahim's companies?

24:04.568 --> 24:08.530
Yes, and for PGD, KW, TOZ and Solidez
there's no evidence of services rendered

24:08.614 --> 24:10.240
nor of any registered employees.

24:10.324 --> 24:13.827
There's no way Ibrahim's companies
could hire contractors this size.

24:13.911 --> 24:16.080
- They're shell companies.
- I'm sure of it.

24:18.916 --> 24:21.752
- Does Rigo know?
- Yes. He authorized the bugs.

24:21.835 --> 24:26.090
Best of all, I've found a receipt
in Ibrahim's email for an Evoke...

24:26.548 --> 24:30.177
under the name of João Pedro
Rangel, Petrobrasil's CEO.

24:31.178 --> 24:33.764
- What's that doing there?
- That's what I want to know.

24:33.847 --> 24:34.890
How?

24:34.973 --> 24:38.394
By requesting arrests for
Ibrahim, Chebab, and Kitano,

24:38.477 --> 24:40.312
search warrants for their properties,

24:40.396 --> 24:43.190
and a bench warrant for João
Pedro to explain the car.

24:43.273 --> 24:46.443
Verena, it will get
messy, won't be easy...

24:46.527 --> 24:47.528
It won't be quick.

24:48.278 --> 24:51.198
- Everything's set for my PhD.
- Forget it.

24:51.281 --> 24:53.409
I want to get things done somewhere else.

24:53.492 --> 24:55.244
If the system doesn't change...

24:55.327 --> 24:58.038
Don't give me the runaround.
We're very well equipped.

24:58.122 --> 25:01.417
- The system's flawed.
- You're flawed, I'm flawed. Fuck it!

25:01.500 --> 25:03.794
- Calm down.
- Rigo authorized the investigation.

25:04.378 --> 25:05.504
He'll issue the arrests.

25:14.263 --> 25:16.724
Four targets in three different cities.

25:18.016 --> 25:21.103
Ibrahim in São Paulo, Chebab
and Kitano in Brasília...

25:21.812 --> 25:23.981
and João Pedro Rangel in Rio.

25:24.064 --> 25:26.191
I requested the arrests
of the first three.

25:26.275 --> 25:27.359
No big deal.

25:29.194 --> 25:30.904
- Your Honor.
- Dimas.

25:35.075 --> 25:38.287
But JPR, Petrobrasil's
CEO, he was a big deal.

25:38.871 --> 25:42.708
If Rigo authorized JPR's bench
warrant, the shit would hit the fan.

25:44.460 --> 25:47.379
Petrobrasil wasn't just any company.

25:49.214 --> 25:53.886
With investments worth 70 billion and
an annual profit of 23 billion reais,

25:54.470 --> 25:57.347
Petrobrasil was the jewel
in the government's crown.

25:57.431 --> 25:58.974
Not only that.

25:59.308 --> 26:01.977
Petrobrasil was already
one of the major...

26:02.060 --> 26:04.480
energy producers in the world.

26:04.563 --> 26:08.066
It was also the pride and joy of
corrupt politicians and contractors.

26:08.150 --> 26:11.236
And, of course, of anyone
else in their entourage.

26:14.448 --> 26:16.492
Our maid is useless.

26:16.575 --> 26:19.244
I have to be in court tomorrow.
Look at this dress.

26:20.537 --> 26:23.457
The Antônio & Lima refinery,
which starts operating today,

26:23.540 --> 26:25.709
will be the largest diesel producer...

26:25.793 --> 26:27.961
- This one or this one?
- The dark one.

26:28.670 --> 26:30.172
It's more professional.

26:30.255 --> 26:32.758
Everyone knew there was
thievery going on,

26:32.841 --> 26:34.676
but no one had the guts to address it.

26:34.760 --> 26:37.930
I have one wish for Petrobrasil
and the other companies hired...

26:38.013 --> 26:40.432
They could have done it
with half the budget.

26:41.016 --> 26:42.226
Yeah, they could.

26:44.144 --> 26:47.856
Because Brazil will be as
big as we want to build it!

26:47.940 --> 26:51.109
It's better to have a refinery than not.

26:51.193 --> 26:52.945
They had enough for two refineries.

26:54.571 --> 26:55.906
Not quite.

26:56.782 --> 27:00.244
There wouldn't be any "political will."

27:00.327 --> 27:02.704
BRAZIL INAUGURATES
COUNTRY'S LARGEST REFINERY

27:08.961 --> 27:10.546
I was about to score.

27:10.629 --> 27:13.924
I just needed to know if Rigo
would be brave enough to join me.

27:17.845 --> 27:19.596
If the answer was yes,

27:21.014 --> 27:22.683
my war would begin.

27:25.352 --> 27:27.020
STATUS: OPERATION AUTHORIZED

27:29.690 --> 27:30.899
Operation authorized.

27:34.486 --> 27:35.404
"Authorized."

27:36.280 --> 27:37.489
- Authorized.
- Authorized?

27:37.573 --> 27:40.284
João Pedro was an uncommon target.

27:40.367 --> 27:44.454
Register the warrants. Roberval
needs to approve them.

27:44.538 --> 27:46.540
- How many states?
- Two.

27:46.623 --> 27:49.418
- São Paulo and Brasília.
- What about Rio de Janeiro?

27:49.501 --> 27:51.545
Rio is out of the requests for now.

27:51.628 --> 27:52.629
What do you mean?

27:52.713 --> 27:55.465
Chebab and Kitano in Brasília,
Ibrahim in São Paulo.

27:55.549 --> 27:57.467
Check the teams available in each city.

27:57.551 --> 28:00.012
Boss, what about that
Evoque on Ibrahim's email?

28:00.095 --> 28:04.057
- And JPR in Rio?
- Rio stays out of the request.

28:04.433 --> 28:05.893
Let's do this. You may start.

28:05.976 --> 28:10.230
If Roberval even dreamed of us bringing
in Petrobrasil's CEO for interrogation,

28:10.898 --> 28:13.150
he would bring the entire
operation to a halt.

28:13.233 --> 28:16.904
So I decided to hide JPR's bench warrant.

28:16.987 --> 28:19.740
For Roberval, we were arresting
currency dealers only.

28:19.823 --> 28:23.285
Kitano and Chebab in Brasília.
Ibrahim in São Paulo.

28:23.368 --> 28:25.579
I'll stay at the base here.
You go to Brasília.

28:26.371 --> 28:28.790
No. I'll go to São Paulo.
That's where Ibrahim is.

28:28.874 --> 28:30.751
Send Vander and Guilhome to Brasília.

28:30.834 --> 28:33.337
You're going to Brasília.
Two targets are there.

28:33.921 --> 28:36.089
- Roberval...
- Verena, I won't say it again.

28:36.173 --> 28:39.676
I'll set up São Paulo with a local unit.
Guilhome stays here with me.

28:39.760 --> 28:41.803
You coordinate the units in Brasília.

28:41.887 --> 28:45.599
We can send Vander and Guilhome. I
want to arrest Ibrahim personally.

28:45.682 --> 28:48.894
We barely have a crew. Don't
make things more difficult.

28:52.481 --> 28:53.649
It was a risky move.

28:54.566 --> 28:57.527
If I interrogated him,
tore down his house,

28:57.611 --> 29:01.323
and still couldn't find enough
proof to attach JPR to the scheme,

29:01.406 --> 29:03.867
Roberval was gonna fuck me over.

29:07.162 --> 29:09.081
And there was also the hick.

29:10.832 --> 29:15.504
No one just shows up to join a team
with a reputation as bad as mine.

29:15.837 --> 29:19.841
If the hick was there, it was because
someone was really interested

29:19.925 --> 29:21.760
in finding out what I was up to.

29:21.843 --> 29:22.678
Hey!

29:23.345 --> 29:25.555
Operation authorized.

29:25.889 --> 29:28.558
But listen, she held back Rio.

29:30.519 --> 29:33.355
Operations with multiple
targets demand attention.

29:33.438 --> 29:36.650
You either get everybody
at once or you get no one.

29:36.900 --> 29:38.944
If a target figures out he's going down,

29:39.027 --> 29:42.239
he tells everybody else and they
begin destroying the evidence.

29:44.074 --> 29:47.828
Roberval stayed in Curitiba. He
managed the teams from there.

29:49.663 --> 29:52.165
We had China on watch at Ibrahim's place.

29:52.249 --> 29:55.002
Ibra arrived at 6 p.m. and
won't leave any time soon.

29:55.794 --> 29:57.296
We're watching him.

29:58.839 --> 30:02.342
Alice. What's this?

30:02.426 --> 30:03.677
Hey!

30:05.178 --> 30:07.180
But, Dad, what about
the pizza we ordered?

30:07.764 --> 30:09.808
I can't. We'll get another when I'm back.

30:15.480 --> 30:20.235
I was in Brasília, following Kitano
and keeping an eye open for Chebab.

30:22.529 --> 30:24.156
- Roberval.
- Everything OK?

30:24.364 --> 30:26.491
Chebab still hasn't shown up.

30:28.994 --> 30:29.828
OK.

30:30.370 --> 30:34.041
As far as Roberval knew, there
was no one in Rio de Janeiro.

30:39.129 --> 30:40.630
The plan was simple.

30:41.465 --> 30:44.509
As soon as the targets in São
Paulo and Brasília were arrested,

30:44.843 --> 30:46.636
Vander would go for the big fish.

30:47.721 --> 30:50.557
I just needed to know if I would
find the evidence I needed.

30:55.979 --> 30:58.940
Did you take your seat belt off?
Here. Come with mommy, come.

31:01.860 --> 31:03.612
Good night, kiddo.

31:03.945 --> 31:06.823
- Where's my grandson?
- He's here!

31:06.907 --> 31:10.869
On your way to grandpa's house!
Here's your grandson.

31:14.039 --> 31:17.250
Spray some repellent on him. Last
time he was covered in bug bites.

31:18.043 --> 31:18.919
Yes, ma'am.

31:19.086 --> 31:21.797
Let's run! Go!

31:27.260 --> 31:28.095
Hi.

31:28.178 --> 31:29.888
Boss, all good here.

31:30.680 --> 31:32.391
The target is at home.

31:32.974 --> 31:35.352
- He's not going anywhere.
- OK.

31:38.688 --> 31:40.232
I'll be here waiting.

31:40.315 --> 31:41.691
Be right back.

31:41.775 --> 31:43.026
I love you.

31:43.527 --> 31:45.487
- Don't forget our deal.
- I won't.

31:46.446 --> 31:47.322
Take care.

31:47.406 --> 31:48.573
- Love you.
- You too.

32:09.052 --> 32:09.928
Hey!

32:10.429 --> 32:11.555
Get me a coffee.

32:20.272 --> 32:21.940
I don't know if it was deliberate,

32:22.023 --> 32:25.277
but Roverbal's São Paulo crew was crap.

32:41.168 --> 32:43.545
NOVA CONCEIÇÃO NEIGHBORHOOD

32:48.175 --> 32:50.343
I bet all I had on Operation Jet Wash.

32:51.344 --> 32:54.014
All I could do now was pray
God would be on my side.

32:54.097 --> 32:55.765
Fuck. We lost Ibrahim's signal.

32:59.019 --> 33:00.145
Gone.

33:00.687 --> 33:02.606
Out of coverage.

33:03.190 --> 33:05.233
He must have left the apartment.

33:16.953 --> 33:19.706
China, what's going on? The
target's signal is gone.

33:19.789 --> 33:20.665
When, boss?

33:20.749 --> 33:23.126
Fuck, China! How did you miss that?

33:32.427 --> 33:33.803
REFRESHING

33:38.725 --> 33:39.893
Nothing yet.

33:40.810 --> 33:42.562
I'm canceling the operation.

33:56.910 --> 33:59.538
THE SON OF A BITCH LEAKED THE OPERATION

34:51.214 --> 34:53.382
Brasília, target number
three on the move.

34:53.466 --> 34:54.926
Ibrahim warned Kitano.

34:55.010 --> 34:56.928
We don't know yet. I'm on her.

35:01.391 --> 35:03.268
It's either all three or none of them.

35:03.351 --> 35:05.979
Roberval, we've come this far.
Let's go for it.

35:06.062 --> 35:07.939
This is a mistake. I'm calling it off.

35:08.023 --> 35:12.736
Ibrahim is on the run, Kitano is too, and
Chebab probably destroyed the evidence.

35:13.320 --> 35:14.696
Give me another hour.

35:14.988 --> 35:16.656
Pain in the ass.

35:24.623 --> 35:26.708
- Coffee?
- I'll have some.

35:32.047 --> 35:35.592
I was pushing the limits,
but with Chebab missing

35:35.675 --> 35:36.926
and Ibrahim on the run,

35:37.010 --> 35:39.429
it was going to be hard to
complete the operation.

35:45.477 --> 35:48.021
ROBERVAL IS CALLING OFF THE OPERATION

35:50.857 --> 35:53.026
WHAT SHOULD I DO?

35:55.362 --> 35:57.697
STAY THERE AT ALL COSTS!

36:03.870 --> 36:05.997
REFRESHING

36:07.624 --> 36:08.541
He's back.

36:09.668 --> 36:11.169
The target's signal is back.

36:11.753 --> 36:12.921
Where?

36:13.380 --> 36:16.591
Congonhas. The airport.

36:17.842 --> 36:19.344
He can fly anywhere.

36:20.178 --> 36:22.430
I'm going to call the Congonhas station

36:22.514 --> 36:24.683
and tell them to detain
him at the screening.

36:24.974 --> 36:27.310
It's useless, but you
can try if you want.

36:29.020 --> 36:31.356
SÃO PAULO CONGONHAS AIRPORT

36:32.357 --> 36:36.111
I couldn't accept it. After
everything that happened to Ruffo,

36:36.194 --> 36:38.530
the son of a bitch was getting away.

36:58.758 --> 36:59.759
- Fuck.
- What?

36:59.843 --> 37:01.177
REFRESHING

37:01.261 --> 37:02.846
We lost Ibrahim's signal again.

37:02.929 --> 37:04.431
He must have taken off by now.

37:05.014 --> 37:07.100
He didn't go through screening, right?

37:07.183 --> 37:10.103
He doesn't fly commercial.
Those guys have private jets.

37:10.645 --> 37:12.355
He could have gone anywhere.

37:12.439 --> 37:15.525
You could have told me. I'd have
got him on private boarding.

37:22.991 --> 37:25.827
Yes, but with an operation
this size, I'm not risking it.

37:25.910 --> 37:27.746
Ibrahim fled. It's over.

37:27.829 --> 37:29.456
I'm calling it off.

37:33.668 --> 37:35.754
China, I'm calling off the operation.

37:36.796 --> 37:37.922
I'll tell Brasília.

37:59.527 --> 38:01.321
Pain in the ass.

38:04.991 --> 38:06.826
Verena isn't picking up.

38:08.161 --> 38:09.537
Who else is on her team?

38:26.346 --> 38:28.431
Deputy. Look at this.

38:29.808 --> 38:31.601
Your boss called off the operation.

39:06.386 --> 39:08.805
