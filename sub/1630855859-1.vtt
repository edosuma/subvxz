02:13.355 --> 02:15.792
<i>It's like you
wake up one day</i>

02:15.923 --> 02:17.446
<i>and you're just here...</i>

02:18.708 --> 02:21.711
<i>like a stone thrown
into this world.</i>

02:23.931 --> 02:25.498
<i>But you don't know
who threw it,</i>

02:25.628 --> 02:29.066
<i>or which direction
it came from...</i>

02:48.434 --> 02:50.653
<i>"Go back to Mississippi,"
you think.</i>

02:54.135 --> 02:56.181
<i>Maybe there will be
a miracle...</i>

02:59.009 --> 03:02.012
<i>some way to begin again...</i>

03:09.803 --> 03:13.067
- All right, turn
this side of your head.
- No.

03:13.198 --> 03:15.896
Oh, look at how dirty
that is.

03:16.026 --> 03:17.071
Mm.

03:18.594 --> 03:20.379
<i>I wish it was true.</i>

03:24.339 --> 03:25.862
<i>God, I wish it was true.</i>

03:54.717 --> 03:55.892
<i>Mama?</i>

03:56.023 --> 03:57.024
<i>Yeah, baby?</i>

03:58.025 --> 04:00.897
<i>Are we
in Mississippi yet?</i>

04:01.028 --> 04:03.160
<i>Yeah, we are.</i>

04:03.291 --> 04:05.685
<i>Can we stop walking now?</i>

04:05.815 --> 04:09.428
<i>You said once we got
to Mississippi,
we could stop walking.</i>

04:11.821 --> 04:13.823
<i>Is that what I said?</i>

04:16.478 --> 04:19.438
We're gonna get
a place real soon, okay?

04:19.568 --> 04:22.571
Now you got to go
to sleep,

04:22.702 --> 04:26.880
and you better dream about
that chocolate ice cream
that you had.

04:30.666 --> 04:32.407
- Mama?
- Yeah.

04:32.538 --> 04:34.670
Tell me about Mississippi again.

04:36.759 --> 04:38.848
Mm... okay.

04:39.893 --> 04:40.763
Well...

04:42.156 --> 04:45.072
Mississippi...

04:45.202 --> 04:47.248
was your daddy's
favorite place.

04:47.379 --> 04:50.120
- Did you know that?
- No.

04:50.251 --> 04:53.167
He was born
and raised here,

04:53.298 --> 04:55.909
and he swore
he'd never leave.

04:58.912 --> 05:03.308
He said that Mississippi
was the place of miracles.

05:04.918 --> 05:08.008
You think he'll give us
our miracle?

05:09.966 --> 05:11.446
<i>Yeah, I do.</i>

05:13.013 --> 05:15.145
<i>I think he's...</i>

05:16.843 --> 05:18.671
<i>...out there,
watching us...</i>

05:20.455 --> 05:22.675
<i>making sure
that we're doing okay.</i>

05:27.244 --> 05:30.117
- I love you.
- Mm, I love you too, baby.

05:30.247 --> 05:31.553
- Good night.
- You gotta go to sleep.

05:31.684 --> 05:34.904
- Okay. Good night.
- Good night.

07:16.441 --> 07:18.617
- What are you doing?
- Going back to my room.

07:20.793 --> 07:24.013
Excuse me. I just wanna
have a conversation
with you, ma'am.

07:24.144 --> 07:25.667
Please don't disrespect me.

07:27.626 --> 07:28.627
Thank you.

07:29.628 --> 07:31.194
Now I'm guessing
you know it's not legal

07:31.325 --> 07:33.414
to go in them trucks
and do them dirty things.

07:33.545 --> 07:35.677
I didn't go
in no truck.

07:35.808 --> 07:38.637
Now I saw you
coming down
off them steps.

07:38.767 --> 07:40.160
Ned called us.

07:41.161 --> 07:43.642
All right? He's tired
of y'all trashing up
his parking lot.

07:43.772 --> 07:46.166
See, this here
is a family establishment.

07:46.296 --> 07:47.950
Well, I didn't do
nothin', so...

07:48.081 --> 07:49.865
- Y'all never do.
- What are you doin'-- Hey!

07:49.996 --> 07:51.998
I told you
that I didn't do--
I didn't do anything!

07:58.221 --> 08:00.093
- What're you doin'?!

08:00.223 --> 08:01.442
I got a kid in there, okay?

08:01.573 --> 08:03.009
- You can't do this.
- Shut your damn mouth!

08:03.139 --> 08:05.620
- I got a kid in there!
- Shut your damn mouth!

08:10.495 --> 08:14.368
- Hey... hey!

08:14.499 --> 08:17.589
Hey. I have my daughter
in the room

08:17.719 --> 08:19.982
and you can't leave her
in there, so...

08:20.113 --> 08:23.290
- And I'm telling you
the truth.
- Aw shucks.

08:23.420 --> 08:25.901
See, I didn't leave her.
You did.

08:27.686 --> 08:29.949
- Oh, stop crying.

08:30.079 --> 08:32.517
Now you're not
going to jail.

08:32.647 --> 08:34.344
And if you were,
I'd have cuffed you already.

08:34.475 --> 08:36.999
You just sit back
and relax.

08:37.130 --> 08:38.566
And if you're
a good little girl,

08:39.785 --> 08:42.309
if you're quieter
than a little church mouse,

08:42.439 --> 08:44.833
you might even get back
to your kid quicker
than you think.

08:55.757 --> 08:57.803
Now I know you know
I'm about to come back there.

08:59.544 --> 09:01.154
A girl like you
shouldn't mind.

09:02.590 --> 09:04.940
- See?

09:07.029 --> 09:08.378
I ain't gonna hurt you.

09:09.379 --> 09:11.381
Maybe we could even
be friends.

09:15.560 --> 09:17.213
How about
a little mood lighting?

09:18.432 --> 09:19.389
That better?

09:35.971 --> 09:37.973
Take off them dirty shoes.

09:52.031 --> 09:55.687
Good girl.
Now the rest.

10:10.440 --> 10:12.617
Now swing them legs
over to me.

10:19.014 --> 10:20.450
There you go.

10:24.759 --> 10:26.761
If you wanna see
that motel room again...

10:28.241 --> 10:30.243
you better goddamn behave.

11:29.694 --> 11:33.219
I wouldn't worry about that.
We ain't done just yet.

11:35.395 --> 11:36.396
- You hear me?!

11:36.526 --> 11:37.919
Take it back off.

11:45.884 --> 11:48.364
I thought that was
what you wanted.

11:48.495 --> 11:50.105
Yeah, it was.

11:58.548 --> 12:01.377
I did what you
told me to do.

12:01.508 --> 12:03.815
And you said that you would
take me back to my kid.

12:03.945 --> 12:05.512
What do you think
would happen

12:05.642 --> 12:08.384
if that kid's momma
got picked up
for prostitution,

12:08.515 --> 12:12.084
kid left there alone
in that shitty motel room?

12:12.214 --> 12:14.869
There's no food
or nothing in there either.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.654
- Huh?

12:19.482 --> 12:20.527
Hey, old boy.

12:20.657 --> 12:22.311
Got us
some new entertainment.

12:23.965 --> 12:25.793
Well, why don't you
come on out
and I'll show you?

12:28.143 --> 12:30.580
Same spot.
Y'all can both come.

12:30.711 --> 12:32.757
Yeah.

12:35.150 --> 12:36.412
Gon' be a party!

12:37.631 --> 12:39.502
We're gonna have us
some company.

12:41.766 --> 12:45.117
You want me to go out
on the hood
and wait for 'em?

12:45.247 --> 12:46.683
Now that's
the spirit!

12:47.815 --> 12:49.425
And why not?

12:49.556 --> 12:51.036
Be a nice
hood ornament.

12:52.559 --> 12:54.169
Don't put nothin' on.

12:59.958 --> 13:01.481
Come on, then.

13:26.854 --> 13:28.551
Ain't got all night.

13:30.205 --> 13:31.163
Attagirl.

13:31.293 --> 13:33.469
It's hot.

13:34.427 --> 13:35.863
Yeah?

13:35.994 --> 13:37.604
Can I get my shirt
to sit on?

13:38.779 --> 13:39.736
Go on.

13:41.477 --> 13:42.870
Hurry up.

14:02.542 --> 14:03.543
Whoa, now.

14:03.673 --> 14:05.937
Are you
fuckin' kidding me?

14:07.373 --> 14:09.636
Don't you know not
to play with guns,
girl, huh?

14:09.766 --> 14:12.073
That ain't a toy.
Put it down!

15:15.484 --> 15:17.878
Mommy!

15:33.328 --> 15:36.027
I know, baby, hang on.

15:44.731 --> 15:47.603
It's okay.
Hey, baby.

15:47.734 --> 15:49.736
Hey, I'm here, baby.

15:49.866 --> 15:53.261
It's okay, shh...

15:53.392 --> 15:57.396
- I know, I know,
I'm so sorry.

17:51.553 --> 17:53.033
Welcome home.

18:01.041 --> 18:02.086
Hey...

18:05.524 --> 18:07.134
They let you out early...

18:07.265 --> 18:10.572
- ...but you still owe, motherfucker.

18:10.703 --> 18:12.922
- You still owe.
-  Hey!

18:13.053 --> 18:14.968
Hey, stop it right there
or I'll call the law.

18:15.099 --> 18:17.101
-  Well,
call 'em, asshole!
- I will call them.

18:17.231 --> 18:18.667
Just back off and go on!

18:20.016 --> 18:21.366
Don't you worry.

18:21.496 --> 18:23.933
You ain't
out of my reach, boy.

18:34.248 --> 18:35.467
You all right, man?

18:36.468 --> 18:37.599
Jesus.

18:53.963 --> 18:55.965
Home, sweet fucking home.

19:36.963 --> 19:38.094
Hey, there,
old man.

19:47.974 --> 19:49.889
Heads up
would have been nice.

19:50.019 --> 19:51.282
Told you I was
getting out soon.

19:51.412 --> 19:52.892
Well, I could've
come pick you up.

19:53.022 --> 19:54.198
Nah, I didn't want
to bother you.

19:54.328 --> 19:56.025
Nah, it weren't
no bother.

19:56.983 --> 19:58.854
Ahem.

19:58.985 --> 20:01.030
This here's Consuela.

20:02.118 --> 20:05.078
<i>- Es mi hijo.
- SÃ­.</i> Same eyes.

20:05.209 --> 20:07.515
- <i>Mucho gusto.</i>

20:09.038 --> 20:10.170
Nice to meet you.

20:11.432 --> 20:14.087
Speaking of eyes,
what happened to your face?

20:14.218 --> 20:16.785
Just a little going away
present from the boys
on the inside,

20:16.916 --> 20:18.657
- I suppose.
- Hmm.

20:21.529 --> 20:23.314
I figure he could use
a little meat
on his bones.

20:23.444 --> 20:25.141
This woman can cook.

20:25.272 --> 20:27.100
Come on, you look like
you need something to eat.
Come here.

20:27.231 --> 20:30.016
- Jeez, I just walked
all the way over here.
- Oh, hell.

20:31.887 --> 20:33.411
Where'd she
come from?

20:35.064 --> 20:38.024
I went to visit
your uncle Clive
down in Bogalusa.

20:38.154 --> 20:42.115
I saw her working
in a sugar cane field.

20:42.246 --> 20:45.074
Big brown eyes
kept watching me
everywhere I went,

20:45.205 --> 20:47.338
and she kept
laughing at me.

20:47.468 --> 20:50.602
Anyway, I figured
I'd go and ask her
why she was laughing.

20:50.732 --> 20:54.040
I mean, you should've seen
how he had them workers livin',
in them ratty shacks,

20:54.170 --> 20:58.174
and... she didn't have
nobody and neither did I, so...

20:58.305 --> 21:00.089
I asked her if she wanted
to come and stay with me,

21:00.220 --> 21:02.440
and she said yes
and she's been here
ever since.

21:02.570 --> 21:04.485
- And the rest is history.
- Yep.

21:04.616 --> 21:06.444
You're speaking
Spanish now.

21:06.574 --> 21:09.011
<i>Muy poco</i>,
but she gets it.

21:10.448 --> 21:12.319
I'll bet she does,
you sly dog.

21:12.450 --> 21:15.191
It ain't like that.
You get your mind
out of the gutter.

21:15.322 --> 21:16.671
Where she sleep?

21:16.802 --> 21:19.283
Um, in your old room,
in the barn.

21:19.413 --> 21:22.111
- You liar.
- Oh, gimme that.

21:40.216 --> 21:43.219
It got awful quiet here
when your mama passed.

21:46.484 --> 21:49.487
Some nights I'd sit
out here and...

21:51.315 --> 21:53.621
it sounded as if the world
had come to an end.

21:58.496 --> 22:01.150
I tried to quit
feeling bad about it.

22:01.281 --> 22:03.109
I hope your mama understands.

22:03.239 --> 22:06.417
Oh, I can't figure
she'd mind.

22:06.547 --> 22:10.116
You can't feel any worse
about her than I do.

22:10.246 --> 22:14.250
I know it hurt her
me being where I was
while she was dying.

22:17.341 --> 22:19.908
Well, she loved you.
And that's all that matters.

22:25.958 --> 22:29.614
I wrote you a bunch
of letters I didn't send.

22:29.744 --> 22:33.748
You know, I figured
you didn't need
the extra weight.

22:33.879 --> 22:36.011
You didn't need more shit,
mine or anyone else's.

22:36.142 --> 22:37.796
Well, that's okay.
I'm here now.

22:39.319 --> 22:40.712
Give me all the shit
you got.

22:47.936 --> 22:50.765
You still got
that old thing, huh?

22:50.896 --> 22:52.637
You talkin'
about the Bible?

22:54.334 --> 22:55.857
She and I sit out here,

22:55.988 --> 22:58.338
helps her
with her English.
She reads.

22:58.469 --> 23:00.993
Just like you and me
used to read when you
was learnin', remember?

23:01.123 --> 23:03.474
- Yeah, I remember.
- You used to love
those old stories.

23:03.604 --> 23:05.258
Daniel in the lion's den
was your favorite.

23:05.389 --> 23:08.130
I don't really believe
in none of that no more.

23:08.261 --> 23:09.828
What, that the lions
didn't eat him?

23:09.958 --> 23:11.960
Nah. I don't believe
in none of it.

23:16.008 --> 23:18.924
I used to go
to these prison chapel
meetings sometimes.

23:19.054 --> 23:21.317
An old white-haired preacher,
a bunch of outlaws

23:21.448 --> 23:23.276
sittin' in all
these folding chairs,

23:23.407 --> 23:25.844
yelling their hallelujahs.

23:27.976 --> 23:30.544
Preacher'd get up,
give his sermon.

23:30.675 --> 23:32.154
And everybody get
to take turns,

23:32.285 --> 23:34.592
getting up at the pulpit,
give their testimonies.

23:34.722 --> 23:37.203
"Yes, I stole."
"Yes, I raped."

23:37.333 --> 23:40.902
"Yes, I beat the shit
out of my fellow man."

23:41.033 --> 23:42.730
"But now I found
the love of God,

23:42.861 --> 23:44.515
now I see the light."

23:44.645 --> 23:46.168
And so on, and so on,

23:46.299 --> 23:48.606
and all their clappings
and "amens," and shit,

23:48.736 --> 23:51.435
and I just didn't care
for it, so I stopped going.

23:51.565 --> 23:52.827
Hmm.

23:55.700 --> 23:56.918
Do you think it's fair?

23:57.049 --> 23:58.833
What? Do I think
what's fair?

23:58.964 --> 23:59.834
Tsk...

24:01.009 --> 24:03.664
Well, that man can get
into the magic Kingdom

24:03.795 --> 24:06.275
no matter what they done,

24:06.406 --> 24:08.452
as long as they say
the magic words.

24:09.801 --> 24:11.803
Words have power
if you mean them.

24:13.239 --> 24:17.112
And it doesn't matter
what you and me think
is fair.

24:17.243 --> 24:18.766
This Good Book

24:18.897 --> 24:21.073
tells me that the door
is always open.

24:22.422 --> 24:23.554
Let me ask you something.

24:23.684 --> 24:25.425
How's what you did
different?

24:25.556 --> 24:28.428
'Cause I made
one big fucking mistake!

24:29.864 --> 24:31.344
And I didn't mean it.
They meant it.

24:31.475 --> 24:34.173
Damn right.
And you ain't them.

24:34.303 --> 24:36.567
You made
a big fucking mistake

24:36.697 --> 24:38.482
and you did
your time for it.

24:38.612 --> 24:40.353
Well, in whose eyes?

24:41.963 --> 24:44.705
Mine? Theirs?

24:45.967 --> 24:48.143
I have an accident,
I get swooped away

24:48.274 --> 24:49.841
and locked away
behind these bars.

24:49.971 --> 24:51.320
Don't get to show
my remorse,

24:51.451 --> 24:53.409
get my sorrys
to nobody that I hurt.

24:53.540 --> 24:56.369
Ain't you, ain't me,
ain't nobody out there

24:56.500 --> 24:59.067
just gonna snap
their fingers

24:59.198 --> 25:02.288
and instill some sort
of forgiveness in me.

25:03.811 --> 25:06.553
Son, you're being
awful damn hard
on yourself.

25:10.514 --> 25:13.865
I got to believe
we can be forgiven.

25:13.995 --> 25:16.781
'Cause if we can't, well,
then we're all fucked.

25:23.875 --> 25:26.399
It was them boys that did
that to your face,
wasn't it?

25:26.530 --> 25:28.532
Waitin' at the bus stop,
soon as I pulled in.

25:28.662 --> 25:31.360
Yeah, fuckin' Larry.

25:31.491 --> 25:34.538
Got you set up
at, uh,

25:34.668 --> 25:38.672
one of my places there
at, uh, Michigan Avenue.

25:38.803 --> 25:40.631
Here's your car keys,
got the keys to the place--

25:40.761 --> 25:42.807
It's that old place
we put the shutters on,
you remember?

25:42.937 --> 25:44.635
Oh, I know.
How could I forget?

25:44.765 --> 25:47.594
Yeah, but, uh, listen,
why don't you
just stay out here,

25:47.725 --> 25:49.944
you give those fellas
some time to cool off?

25:50.075 --> 25:52.207
Oh, they ain't
coolin' off
any time soon.

25:52.338 --> 25:53.861
'Sides, they know
where you live.

25:53.992 --> 25:57.038
They can pull up the driveway
just as easy as I can.

25:58.562 --> 26:00.172
I ain't bringin' that
out here.

26:02.522 --> 26:04.611
Well, I've got
something for you.
Hang on to these.

26:14.447 --> 26:16.275
Here.

26:19.321 --> 26:23.543
I don't recall anything
about no hunting rifle
in the New Testament.

26:23.674 --> 26:27.852
Well, you can only turn
so many cheeks,
and I only got four, so...

26:27.982 --> 26:32.073
I'd be breaking
about two dozen laws
just by having it.

26:32.204 --> 26:34.119
I'd feel a whole lot better
knowing you're safe.

26:34.249 --> 26:37.383
- Ain't gon' be that bad.
- Well, you don't know
how it's gonna get.

26:41.605 --> 26:42.910
Okay.

26:47.828 --> 26:49.787
<i>Do you ever think
about that moment?</i>

26:52.006 --> 26:54.269
<i>That moment I got
a little too big, too old,</i>

26:54.400 --> 26:56.271
<i>too heavy for you to carry?</i>

26:56.402 --> 27:00.362
<i>You think to yourself,
"Goddamn! I can't carry
my son no more."</i>

27:03.757 --> 27:05.846
<i>You don't have to carry me
no more, Dad.</i>

27:07.195 --> 27:09.197
<i>I'll be okay.</i>

27:46.278 --> 27:48.759
- Thank you.

27:50.848 --> 27:52.110
Shot of Bug, please.

29:50.837 --> 29:53.013
Get out of the truck!
Show me your hands!

30:00.281 --> 30:01.979
Slowly.

30:09.900 --> 30:13.381
Get that goddamn thing
out of my face, Boyd!

30:14.948 --> 30:16.776
Well, I'll be damned!

30:16.907 --> 30:18.386
- When'd you get home?
- Noon.

30:18.517 --> 30:20.824
- Noon today?
- Noon today.

30:20.954 --> 30:22.564
Give me some love, man.
Don't stand there.

30:22.695 --> 30:23.914
- All right.

30:27.918 --> 30:29.528
Stop it.

30:29.658 --> 30:31.486
We grown now. You can't be
lifting me up like that.

30:31.617 --> 30:33.880
- Oh, I got you.

30:34.011 --> 30:36.143
Well, talk to me.
How was it?

30:36.274 --> 30:39.930
About what you can imagine,
'cept way fucking worse.

30:42.497 --> 30:45.109
How's Lacey? She still
turning backflips?

30:45.239 --> 30:46.893
God no! She couldn't put
her right leg

30:47.024 --> 30:48.982
in that old cheerleader
outfit if she wanted to.

30:50.679 --> 30:52.507
You gotta love her,
though, man. You got to.

30:54.248 --> 30:55.946
So what's goin' on here?

30:56.076 --> 30:58.731
Ain't no point
in keeping it a secret.

30:58.862 --> 31:00.254
Be on the news tomorrow.

31:00.385 --> 31:02.430
One of our own shot
with his own pistol,

31:02.561 --> 31:03.910
which we can't seem
to find.

31:04.041 --> 31:06.695
- Shit.

31:06.826 --> 31:08.175
Anyone I know?

31:08.306 --> 31:10.961
Nah, this guy came down
from Tupelo or somewhere

31:11.091 --> 31:12.179
a year or two back.

31:13.180 --> 31:15.139
Been on thin ice
ever since he got here.

31:15.269 --> 31:18.533
So I wouldn't be surprised
if something ain't catch
back up to his ass.

31:18.664 --> 31:20.927
Just hate for Lacey
to find out about this one.

31:21.058 --> 31:23.321
She stays worried enough
about me, you know?

31:23.451 --> 31:25.018
Oh, I bet.

31:25.149 --> 31:28.195
Well, they're gonna ask me
if I checked you out, so...

31:28.326 --> 31:30.371
I gotta check you out,
see what's in the truck.

31:30.502 --> 31:32.634
Okay, yeah.
Open it up.

31:43.080 --> 31:45.473
Russ, you ain't been out
24 hours.

31:45.604 --> 31:48.563
Shit, man! You know
you ain't supposed
to have no gun.

31:48.694 --> 31:51.262
Just got out
of the damn cage, Boyd.

31:51.392 --> 31:52.872
You don't know
what that feels like.

31:53.003 --> 31:54.830
- You wanna go back
to the cage?
- No.

31:54.961 --> 31:56.484
Didn't think so,
so if I was you,

31:56.615 --> 31:58.051
get in the truck
and call it a night.

32:01.228 --> 32:02.447
Yes, officer.

32:19.333 --> 32:20.465
<i>This is it.</i>

32:22.032 --> 32:24.556
You have the whole place
to yourselves.

32:24.686 --> 32:27.080
The doors lock
at 8 p.m.

32:27.211 --> 32:29.648
If you go out,
you need a password
to get in.

32:29.778 --> 32:32.651
Oh, hey, you wait.
You let me help you
get up there.

32:32.781 --> 32:34.087
Well, let me help
put your bags away.

32:34.218 --> 32:36.524
No. We're good.

32:38.439 --> 32:39.701
Is, uh...

32:39.832 --> 32:41.225
Is there anything
I can do for-for work?

32:41.355 --> 32:42.748
I mean, I'll do
just about anything.

32:42.878 --> 32:44.793
There's a bar
up the road

32:44.924 --> 32:47.318
where you can help
with the dishes
and work in the kitchen.

32:47.448 --> 32:50.886
Now, it ain't much,
but he pays out
at the end of the day.

32:52.888 --> 32:55.282
Can I work today?

32:55.413 --> 32:56.849
You look
like you need a break.

32:56.980 --> 32:58.416
I don't.

32:59.547 --> 33:01.680
You sure nobody's
following you?

33:01.810 --> 33:03.595
We get that.

33:06.685 --> 33:08.948
Didn't you tell her
that she could have
a hot dog?

33:09.079 --> 33:10.036
Hmm?

33:11.124 --> 33:13.126
- You want a hot dog?
- Come on, baby.

33:58.128 --> 34:01.609
Sometimes I have a hard time
remembering how old he'd be.

34:01.740 --> 34:04.656
I ride by here
just to remind myself.

34:04.786 --> 34:06.049
You ever do that?

34:06.179 --> 34:08.573
I could say
at anytime...

34:08.703 --> 34:11.750
exactly how old
he'd be.

34:11.880 --> 34:13.839
Twenty-five years,
three months.

34:13.969 --> 34:16.189
Yeah, I wish
I could do that.

34:18.278 --> 34:19.888
It's all right.

34:20.019 --> 34:23.805
You got a busy life,
you got a family.

34:23.936 --> 34:25.459
Ain't nobody blamin' you.

34:28.071 --> 34:31.683
Besides...
I remember enough
for the both of us.

34:39.691 --> 34:42.346
Why do you always
do that?

34:42.476 --> 34:46.219
His toll.
To bring him home.

34:48.656 --> 34:50.658
There's always
a price to pay.

35:01.278 --> 35:03.367
I like that.

35:10.852 --> 35:13.855
Man, it's no wonder
these boys are stacked
like brick houses,

35:13.986 --> 35:14.943
you feedin' them like that.

35:15.074 --> 35:16.336
Well, they're hearty eaters.

35:16.467 --> 35:17.468
Boys...

35:18.817 --> 35:20.993
Well, I thank you
much, Lacey.

35:21.124 --> 35:21.994
That was damn good.

35:22.125 --> 35:23.952
We're just glad
you're home.

35:24.083 --> 35:26.477
I'm just glad these boys
took after you.

35:26.607 --> 35:30.002
-  Your mouth
to God's ears.
-  Hey, now.

35:33.223 --> 35:34.963
Oh, I see
you're up to mischief.

35:36.661 --> 35:38.489
- 'Bout that time?

35:38.619 --> 35:40.795
Don't act
like you don't know.

35:59.858 --> 36:02.121
Why the hell
you didn't call me
knowing you was getting out?

36:02.252 --> 36:03.688
Hmm?

36:03.818 --> 36:06.125
You know I would've drove
down there and got you.

36:07.996 --> 36:09.824
You know it don't work
like that.

36:09.955 --> 36:11.957
Tsk, see, uh...

36:12.087 --> 36:13.698
that's where you're wrong.

36:13.828 --> 36:15.395
I got special privileges.

36:15.526 --> 36:17.919
Flash 'em the old badge.

36:20.792 --> 36:22.837
- Special privileges.
- Well, I'll just
show 'em mine.

36:22.968 --> 36:24.361
That didn't work anyways.

36:24.491 --> 36:25.840
- And it's bigger.

36:25.971 --> 36:28.582
Always has been,
always will be.

36:31.542 --> 36:32.804
All fools.

36:35.415 --> 36:37.765
Tsk. Larry had it figured.

36:39.854 --> 36:41.552
That's what happened
to your face?

36:41.682 --> 36:42.814
Sure is.

36:43.902 --> 36:45.686
How serious do you think
the brothers are?

36:45.817 --> 36:48.733
Oh, I don't know
how serious they are together.

36:48.863 --> 36:51.039
I know Larry's
pretty serious
all on his own.

36:52.911 --> 36:54.173
You want me to go
say something?

36:54.304 --> 36:55.914
- 'Cause you know I will.
- No. Shit, no.

36:56.044 --> 36:58.264
I've dealt with way worse
since the last time
I saw you.

36:58.395 --> 37:01.267
Besides, Larry's
just a puppy dog,
comparatively speaking.

37:01.398 --> 37:04.618
Yeah, an aggravating,
chew-up-your-shit
puppy dog, though.

37:04.749 --> 37:06.968
There's a big difference.

37:07.099 --> 37:08.274
Well, you know...

37:12.235 --> 37:14.019
How you doin'?
You doin' okay?

37:14.149 --> 37:15.673
Doing good.

37:18.197 --> 37:20.068
Russ, come on.

37:20.199 --> 37:21.635
How you really doin'?

37:24.203 --> 37:25.857
Thought I'd feel
a little different.

37:25.987 --> 37:28.773
Feels good
all at the same time, but...

37:28.903 --> 37:31.123
I don't know.

37:31.254 --> 37:32.429
You seen her yet?

37:33.430 --> 37:34.822
No, not yet.

37:35.823 --> 37:37.085
But it's a small town,

37:37.216 --> 37:40.088
I'm bound to run into her
sooner or later.

37:40.219 --> 37:42.874
Man...

37:43.004 --> 37:47.270
We burned up a lot of miles
and a lot of time
out on those roads.

37:47.400 --> 37:48.488
I missed that.

37:50.925 --> 37:52.623
Turns out,
I missed you too, bro.

37:52.753 --> 37:56.017
Oh, don't get
all gushy on me.

37:58.759 --> 38:00.195
I missed you too, bud.

38:00.326 --> 38:02.981
I knew it.
I knew it.

40:37.788 --> 40:40.486
<i>How long
have you been here?</i>

40:40.617 --> 40:41.661
<i>All morning.</i>

40:43.054 --> 40:45.056
<i>Hadn't gotten up
the courage to knock.</i>

40:46.927 --> 40:48.886
You look the same.

40:49.016 --> 40:51.802
-  Please.
- You do.

40:53.456 --> 40:56.720
Well... you look like
you could use a hot meal.

40:58.330 --> 41:00.158
You know, people
keep saying that to me,

41:00.288 --> 41:02.595
but nobody's offered
to buy me any dinner.

41:06.947 --> 41:08.645
You all right?

41:11.822 --> 41:13.563
Yeah, I'm okay.

41:15.739 --> 41:16.653
You?

41:18.002 --> 41:21.092
Oh, yes.

41:21.222 --> 41:22.789
I'm all right.

41:28.578 --> 41:30.971
I bet your daddy's happy
that you're home.

41:33.844 --> 41:35.541
I was sorry
about your mama.

41:35.672 --> 41:37.456
Yeah...

41:39.240 --> 41:42.156
Yeah, boy.

41:42.287 --> 41:45.029
Sure would've been nice
for her to see me make it.

41:48.336 --> 41:50.556
I bet she's smiling.

41:56.910 --> 41:58.346
Remodeling?

42:00.131 --> 42:02.350
Hurricane last night.

42:02.481 --> 42:04.091
I bet.

42:04.222 --> 42:05.702
That hurricane
got a name?

42:05.832 --> 42:07.181
Oh, they usually do.

42:18.279 --> 42:19.846
You still mad
at me?

42:21.935 --> 42:23.937
I told you then
like I'll tell you now.

42:25.460 --> 42:27.550
Ain't nothing
to be mad about.

42:31.162 --> 42:33.381
Seems like you told me
the same thing.

42:34.992 --> 42:36.036
I knows it.

42:37.995 --> 42:39.997
I just wondered.

42:42.477 --> 42:45.611
I'm the one that told you
to stop coming to see me.

42:47.961 --> 42:49.876
But I'm the one
who agreed.

42:59.320 --> 43:01.061
How many kids?

43:02.410 --> 43:05.413
I got twin boys
and a little girl.

43:05.544 --> 43:06.806
How old?

43:09.156 --> 43:12.595
My boys are four
and the girl is two.

43:23.388 --> 43:26.609
Man, all I want to do
is hold your hand right now.

43:28.175 --> 43:29.612
Just for one minute.

44:22.229 --> 44:24.754
There's a whole lot
between us now.

44:28.409 --> 44:30.194
A whole lot...

44:36.766 --> 44:38.768
I can't keep it anymore.

44:40.378 --> 44:42.119
But it's yours.

44:43.860 --> 44:45.513
It was.

44:47.037 --> 44:49.387
I gotta go.

45:37.565 --> 45:38.828
Hello.

45:39.829 --> 45:42.570
- Mommy!

45:42.701 --> 45:45.704
Hi, baby. Thank you
for watching her.

45:47.184 --> 45:49.186
- What are you doing?
- Coloring.

45:49.316 --> 45:51.057
Red? Too scary.
Too scary.

45:51.188 --> 45:52.667
- Purple!
- Yeah!

45:52.798 --> 45:55.670
Purple, a really
nice light...

45:55.801 --> 45:58.761
- shade of purple.
- Yeah.

45:58.891 --> 46:00.501
<i>Tell me about Daddy.</i>

46:04.027 --> 46:05.115
Well...

46:06.725 --> 46:08.031
<i>You have his eyes.</i>

46:08.161 --> 46:10.990
<i>- I do?
- Mm-hmm.</i>

46:11.121 --> 46:16.822
<i>And he would've been
able to make you
laugh so hard</i>

46:16.953 --> 46:20.173
<i>that I think
you would've broken ribs.</i>

46:23.873 --> 46:25.526
<i>And he was just...</i>

46:26.832 --> 46:28.791
so real.

46:29.835 --> 46:31.489
And so kind.

46:33.534 --> 46:35.536
<i>And he was my first everything.</i>

46:38.888 --> 46:40.715
And together
we made you.

46:42.848 --> 46:45.285
And you're...

46:45.416 --> 46:48.375
the most important thing
in the whole world,
do you know that?

46:51.509 --> 46:52.727
Hmm?

47:06.567 --> 47:09.048
- Analee... Analee,
where's our stuff?
- Yeah?

47:09.179 --> 47:10.615
In there?

47:14.010 --> 47:15.185
Who told you
to empty the bag?

47:15.315 --> 47:17.448
I-I-I didn't do it.
The lady did.

47:21.669 --> 47:24.411
- Get on your shoes.
-  What for?

47:24.542 --> 47:27.762
Do what I say
and put your shoes on
and get your stuff.

47:27.893 --> 47:29.329
But I don't wanna go!

47:29.460 --> 47:32.115
Baby, shh! I know
you wanna stay here,

47:32.245 --> 47:34.813
- but we gotta go.
- W-what's happening?

47:34.944 --> 47:37.468
Just listen to me.
Do what I say
and put your shoes on.

47:37.598 --> 47:39.296
And get the rest
of your stuff over there.

47:39.426 --> 47:41.254
- You said we could
stop walking...
- I know what I said.

47:41.385 --> 47:44.083
- ...once we got
to Mississippi--
- Hey! Baby!

47:44.214 --> 47:46.869
Look at me. I love you.
I'm gonna take care of you,

47:46.999 --> 47:49.001
but you gotta do
what I'm telling you
to do right now.

47:49.132 --> 47:50.785
Do you get it?

47:52.657 --> 47:54.267
- Mommy, where are we going?

47:55.660 --> 47:57.531
I want my crayons.

47:59.403 --> 48:00.665
- Mommy!
- Shh!

48:06.801 --> 48:08.281
Okay, this way.

48:10.283 --> 48:13.547
Okay. Now you have
to be so quiet.

48:14.809 --> 48:16.333
No talking.

48:16.463 --> 48:18.030
We're playing
the silent game

48:18.161 --> 48:20.293
- and you wanna win, right?
- Yeah.

48:25.472 --> 48:27.518
I want my crayons.

48:29.389 --> 48:32.523
- You're gonna lose
if you say anything.
-  Okay.

48:38.833 --> 48:40.270
I don't know...

48:42.750 --> 48:45.144
I found it
unpacking their clothes.

48:47.494 --> 48:50.802
I get the feeling
they're in some kind
of trouble.

48:52.673 --> 48:54.980
Okay.

48:55.111 --> 48:57.548
Okay, listen to me,
baby girl.

48:58.941 --> 49:01.552
Mommy messed up, okay?

49:01.682 --> 49:05.208
I messed up really bad.
Big mistake.

49:05.338 --> 49:08.037
But you wanna stay
with Mommy, right?

49:08.167 --> 49:10.691
'Cause I really want
to stay with you

49:10.822 --> 49:12.606
and, if we're gonna
stay together,

49:12.737 --> 49:15.609
we have to go right now.

49:15.740 --> 49:19.265
And you have to do exactly
what I'm about to tell you
to do, okay?

49:19.396 --> 49:20.527
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

49:32.583 --> 49:34.280
Can we go yet?

49:35.542 --> 49:36.848
Okay.

49:38.502 --> 49:41.200
Okay. Go. Go!

50:31.207 --> 50:32.469
Hello?

50:34.384 --> 50:36.647
Wait. Where's Analee?

50:38.214 --> 50:40.129
She's not in the room?

50:42.087 --> 50:43.654
Is the mother back?

50:57.233 --> 50:58.234
Hello?

51:02.064 --> 51:04.022
Analee, is that you, honey?

51:05.937 --> 51:07.417
Is anyone there?

52:04.865 --> 52:06.693
-  Don't move.

52:08.869 --> 52:10.393
Get in the truck.

52:12.525 --> 52:14.310
Will you get
in the truck?

52:14.440 --> 52:16.355
- All right?
- I'm goin'.

52:16.486 --> 52:17.748
Hurry up.

52:38.377 --> 52:40.553
Okay, just turn on
the car.

52:40.684 --> 52:42.860
Turn on the car
and drive!

52:42.990 --> 52:45.036
- Where?

52:45.167 --> 52:49.214
Just-just go.
Get a-- Get away
from the lights.

52:49.345 --> 52:50.781
North, go North.

52:55.351 --> 52:56.743
- Mama?
- Yeah, baby.

52:56.874 --> 52:59.093
I gotta pee
really badly.

53:01.183 --> 53:03.533
Okay, how bad
do you have to pee?

53:03.663 --> 53:07.363
- Really badly.
Can we stop, please?
- We'll find her a place.

53:07.493 --> 53:09.582
I got a place
for you to pee.

53:11.367 --> 53:14.065
And you can lower
that pistol as well.

53:14.196 --> 53:15.632
Lot of potholes out here,

53:15.762 --> 53:17.503
don't need you
accidentally shooting me.

53:17.634 --> 53:20.071
Didn't come this far
to have it read
on my tombstone

53:20.202 --> 53:22.204
"Accidentally shot
by some woman."

53:26.033 --> 53:28.210
If I shoot you,
it's not an accident.

53:31.517 --> 53:34.216
Tsk. Understood.

53:40.222 --> 53:43.312
You hurry up. Okay?
Go pee fast--

53:43.442 --> 53:46.271
- Hey!
- No. No!

53:46.402 --> 53:47.751
Fucking give that
back to me.

53:47.881 --> 53:50.101
Oh, I think
I'll hold on to that.

53:58.718 --> 54:00.285
This ain't your gun.

54:03.636 --> 54:05.943
Can you just
give me back that gun?

54:06.073 --> 54:07.771
You can empty it out,
I don't care, just--

54:09.338 --> 54:11.209
- Just give it back to me.
- I will...

54:11.340 --> 54:14.081
when you tell me
who it belongs to.

54:22.133 --> 54:24.004
I tried to fix all this...

54:26.442 --> 54:29.053
before it even started.

54:29.183 --> 54:31.229
You know,
I went down...

54:33.100 --> 54:35.538
to this place in New Orleans
when I found out
I was pregnant.

54:35.668 --> 54:37.670
I thought it was
the right thing to do.

54:39.324 --> 54:40.760
Maybe it was.

54:46.070 --> 54:47.289
But as I--

54:49.029 --> 54:51.728
As I was sittin' there,
in that room, waiting,

54:51.858 --> 54:54.121
and I don't know,
I just started thinking
that, you know,

54:54.252 --> 54:56.863
maybe everything
was going to be okay.

54:59.039 --> 55:01.346
I've tried
so fucking hard...

55:03.435 --> 55:06.395
You know, I actually
didn't even know a person
could, uh...

55:08.571 --> 55:11.051
could try that hard.

55:11.182 --> 55:15.839
But you know, uh...
nowhere worked out.

55:15.969 --> 55:18.276
Not Shreveport, not...

55:18.407 --> 55:21.845
not Beaumont,
not Lake Charles, and...

55:25.936 --> 55:27.764
I can't feed her.

55:30.157 --> 55:32.377
I can't put
clothes on her.

55:34.118 --> 55:37.817
I can't give her
a fucking place to sleep
and now this.

55:37.948 --> 55:40.429
So yeah... [sniffles] Uh...

55:40.559 --> 55:44.868
If you could just
leave us here...

55:44.998 --> 55:46.783
Please...

55:46.913 --> 55:48.741
And what about
your family?

55:49.960 --> 55:53.703
What about her daddy?
What about your mama?

55:55.748 --> 55:58.185
Not everybody
has somebody.

56:06.890 --> 56:08.761
So where to now?

56:12.461 --> 56:14.245
I'll make you a promise.

56:14.376 --> 56:18.945
I'll drive you anywhere,
within reason.

56:19.076 --> 56:21.905
But we're gonna
take a rest tonight.

56:23.123 --> 56:23.994
Okay?

56:33.264 --> 56:34.874
<i>I knew
it wasn't gonna end.</i>

56:36.789 --> 56:40.402
<i>All I could see
was her face.</i>

56:40.532 --> 56:42.273
Thinking that I'd left her,

56:42.404 --> 56:45.407
thinking that nobody
in the whole world
cared about her.

56:49.846 --> 56:52.109
So I stole his gun
and I shot him.

56:52.239 --> 56:54.328
I shot him
until he wasn't movin'
no more.

57:03.599 --> 57:05.601
But you don't look
like a killer to me.

57:08.038 --> 57:10.867
I've seen plenty,
I know what they look like.

57:23.662 --> 57:26.622
Why are you holdin' on
to that gun, anyway?

57:28.450 --> 57:30.452
You know that damn thing
gon' bury you.

57:33.019 --> 57:36.153
If there's one thing
in the world
that could bury you...

57:38.155 --> 57:40.157
would you wanna know
where it was?

57:43.639 --> 57:45.162
What's your name?

58:06.879 --> 58:08.185
Got her?

58:09.708 --> 58:12.102
You guys just sleep in here.
I'll take the back.

58:19.718 --> 58:21.024
Maben.

58:25.811 --> 58:27.465
My name's Maben.

58:33.297 --> 58:34.341
I'm Russell.

58:59.279 --> 59:00.933
Maben...

59:05.155 --> 59:07.461
You gotta be kiddin' me.

59:13.555 --> 59:15.208
Cody?

59:17.646 --> 59:19.517
Cody, boy.

59:21.693 --> 59:25.305
Big papa's home.
Big--

59:26.611 --> 59:27.830
Hey. Hey, I--

59:27.960 --> 59:29.571
Look, I know
that it's--

59:29.701 --> 59:32.008
- You're not supposed
to be here.
-  I-I know.

59:32.138 --> 59:34.097
- I know, I know.
- Go on, Larry.
Go on. Come on.

59:34.227 --> 59:37.187
Look, look,
is-is he here?

59:37.317 --> 59:40.582
- Is Cody here?
- 'Course he's here.

59:40.712 --> 59:43.149
- Could I-could I see him
for a minute?
- Oh, Larry.

59:43.280 --> 59:45.543
- It's the middle of the night.
- Baby, baby, please, please.

59:45.674 --> 59:47.023
No, it's the middle
of the night.

59:47.153 --> 59:48.546
I just wanna see him
for a minute.

59:52.506 --> 59:54.117
I see you've been drinking.

59:57.163 --> 59:59.426
Yeah. Yeah,
I've been drinking.

01:00:07.434 --> 01:00:10.002
I just got
one question, okay?

01:00:10.133 --> 01:00:12.918
Is-is-is he still
playing Little League?

01:00:14.833 --> 01:00:18.489
- Is he still playing?
Is he-is he--

01:00:18.620 --> 01:00:21.318
Is he swinging the bat
like his Daddy showed him?

01:00:21.448 --> 01:00:24.930
He's too big
for Little League, Larry!

01:00:25.061 --> 01:00:26.410
Goddammit!

01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:28.760
You'd know that
if you saw him.

01:00:28.891 --> 01:00:31.284
Well, fuck!
You won't let me see him.

01:00:31.415 --> 01:00:33.939
That ain't fuckin' fair!
What are you talking about,
"if I saw him"?

01:00:34.070 --> 01:00:35.898
I've been tryin' to see him,
that's why I'm here!

01:00:36.028 --> 01:00:38.944
Get sober
and you can see
your son.

01:00:39.075 --> 01:00:41.512
- That's what I said.
-  I'm fuckin' trying!

01:00:41.643 --> 01:00:43.296
- Not hard enough!
- Cody, boy!

01:00:43.427 --> 01:00:46.778
You fuckin' be quiet!
We got a restraining order.

01:00:46.909 --> 01:00:48.824
I don't wanna have to call
somebody, please.

01:00:48.954 --> 01:00:50.216
Who the fuck
you gonna call?

01:00:50.347 --> 01:00:52.218
Huh?
You fuckin' call 'em!

01:00:52.349 --> 01:00:54.177
I remember
that restraining order.
Fuck you!

01:00:54.307 --> 01:00:56.527
- Call! You call!
- I will fuckin' call
somebody out here.

01:00:56.658 --> 01:00:59.399
I will call
somebody out here.
You get out! Get out!

01:01:01.227 --> 01:01:03.012
- You hear that, boy?

01:01:03.142 --> 01:01:06.711
- Your Daddy's out here,
trying to see you!

01:01:09.061 --> 01:01:11.890
Don't ever fuckin' say
I didn't try, boy!

01:01:14.066 --> 01:01:16.721
Don't ever say
I didn't fuckin--

01:01:46.316 --> 01:01:48.753
- Baby girl.

01:01:54.933 --> 01:01:58.720
- Time to wake up.
- Okay.

01:02:01.113 --> 01:02:03.550
- Did you sleep okay?
- Yeah.

01:02:03.681 --> 01:02:05.030
Yeah?

01:02:08.555 --> 01:02:10.427
I have a present for you.

01:02:10.557 --> 01:02:12.516
- You do?
- Yeah, I forgot about it

01:02:12.646 --> 01:02:16.215
until I was lookin'
at you while you were asleep.

01:02:20.698 --> 01:02:22.134
Crayons?

01:02:23.266 --> 01:02:26.443
- In all
of your favorite colors.
- Thank you, mama.

01:02:26.573 --> 01:02:28.401
- Thank you, mama.

01:02:35.582 --> 01:02:37.933
- All right, who wants
to get out of here

01:02:38.063 --> 01:02:40.065
and go get a bite to eat
for breakfast?

01:02:41.284 --> 01:02:42.546
I got us a plan.

01:02:44.156 --> 01:02:45.418
What's the plan?

01:02:45.549 --> 01:02:47.769
I know a place you can go.

01:02:49.335 --> 01:02:50.772
Somewhere safe.

01:02:53.035 --> 01:02:55.341
If I'm gonna trust you,
you're gonna have
to trust me.

01:02:57.343 --> 01:02:58.605
Okay?

01:03:00.216 --> 01:03:02.653
We're gonna get
a little bite to eat, huh?

01:03:02.784 --> 01:03:05.699
Oh, we'll fill that belly.

01:03:05.830 --> 01:03:07.353
- Sleep all right?

01:03:11.270 --> 01:03:13.838
-  <i>G'morning, Mr. Gaines.</i>
-  <i>Boyd!</i>

01:03:13.969 --> 01:03:15.448
<i>You happen to see Russell
this morning?</i>

01:03:15.579 --> 01:03:17.233
Uh, not yet.

01:03:17.363 --> 01:03:18.756
Any idea where he is?

01:03:18.887 --> 01:03:20.802
No, I was looking for 'im.
You went by the house?

01:03:20.932 --> 01:03:23.543
I did, I did,
saw the windows.

01:03:23.674 --> 01:03:25.458
Is that what this is about?

01:03:27.373 --> 01:03:31.073
After we found our man,
Russell came drivin' up.

01:03:31.203 --> 01:03:33.727
Just him, nobody else
all night, way out there,

01:03:33.858 --> 01:03:36.034
so... I gotta ask him
about it, that's all.

01:03:36.165 --> 01:03:38.820
Maybe he mighta seen
something that we're not?

01:03:38.950 --> 01:03:41.431
- That's it?
- That's it, I swear.

01:03:41.561 --> 01:03:43.476
I'm sorry to hear
about your man.

01:03:43.607 --> 01:03:45.609
Thank you. Yeah.

01:03:45.739 --> 01:03:48.177
Well, I just need his eyes.
Just have him call me, please?

01:03:48.307 --> 01:03:49.439
I will. Oh, and Boyd.

01:03:49.569 --> 01:03:51.702
Um, keep an eye
on them boys, will you?

01:03:51.833 --> 01:03:53.399
Especially Larry.

01:03:53.530 --> 01:03:55.706
I can guarantee it was him
that busted out them windows.

01:03:55.837 --> 01:03:57.969
They already put a knot
on the side of his head

01:03:58.100 --> 01:03:59.623
when they met him
at the bus station.

01:04:01.451 --> 01:04:03.279
I'll pay attention.

01:04:03.409 --> 01:04:05.281
Thanks, Boyd.

01:04:14.681 --> 01:04:16.292
You girls
sit tight here.

01:04:20.426 --> 01:04:21.993
Got some company.

01:04:27.259 --> 01:04:29.261
Oh, it's good to see
you're still breathing.

01:04:29.392 --> 01:04:31.655
You gotta remember
there's people
give a shit about you.

01:04:33.831 --> 01:04:35.833
What the hell
is going on?

01:04:35.964 --> 01:04:38.357
I mean, the place
was all busted up,
I assume you didn't do it.

01:04:38.488 --> 01:04:42.057
I ain't worried
about none of that
right now.

01:04:42.187 --> 01:04:45.408
I'm gonna ask you a question,
all I need is a yes or no.

01:04:45.538 --> 01:04:48.933
I need that old place
in the barn for them.

01:04:49.064 --> 01:04:50.935
I'll explain
everything later.

01:04:51.066 --> 01:04:53.242
Boyd was snooping around,
I mean, something
you ain't tellin' me.

01:04:53.372 --> 01:04:54.808
Yes or no,
that's all I need.

01:04:54.939 --> 01:04:56.636
Oh, yeah, there's something
you ain't telling me.

01:04:56.767 --> 01:04:58.508
All right, well,
I got your back.

01:04:58.638 --> 01:05:01.250
But you got-- you know,
don't keep me
in the dark here.

01:05:04.644 --> 01:05:06.211
I want you to pretend

01:05:06.342 --> 01:05:08.735
it's that first time
you saw Consuela...

01:05:10.128 --> 01:05:12.739
and you did what you did
because you thought
it was right.

01:05:14.741 --> 01:05:16.743
- They look hungry.

01:05:16.874 --> 01:05:18.528
I make food.

01:05:18.658 --> 01:05:21.313
Very kind of you,
Consuela. Thank you.

01:05:21.444 --> 01:05:23.359
One more thing.
Don't tell anyone
they're here.

01:05:23.489 --> 01:05:25.491
Well, I'm not
a complete idiot.

01:05:36.328 --> 01:05:38.765
-  It's pretty big.
- Well...

01:05:38.896 --> 01:05:40.158
Here it is.

01:05:41.855 --> 01:05:43.466
Go on in.

01:05:48.950 --> 01:05:52.866
Bet you probably expected
something to go moo
when you came in then.

01:06:05.401 --> 01:06:07.838
Hopefully this is
comfortable for y'all.

01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:11.885
Bathroom is
right over there.

01:06:12.016 --> 01:06:14.062
Don't judge a book
by its cover.

01:06:15.411 --> 01:06:17.369
It's nice.

01:06:17.500 --> 01:06:20.372
I'll get you
maybe some water.

01:06:20.503 --> 01:06:21.634
Hey!

01:06:21.765 --> 01:06:23.767
I know your mama
probably said...

01:06:24.898 --> 01:06:27.553
there's no jumping
on the bed.

01:06:27.684 --> 01:06:29.773
Well, if there's one bed
in this whole world

01:06:29.903 --> 01:06:31.383
that you can jump off,
it's...

01:06:32.645 --> 01:06:34.821
it's this one.

01:06:34.952 --> 01:06:37.737
You jump on that
with everything
your life's got to give.

01:06:37.868 --> 01:06:41.698
-  Okay.
- I don't hear you jumping.

01:06:41.828 --> 01:06:44.396
Thank you!

01:06:51.012 --> 01:06:53.927
All right,
slow and steady.

01:06:55.581 --> 01:06:58.541
- Okay!
- Look, mama!
I caught another one.

01:06:58.671 --> 01:07:00.934
Look at that!
Call it beginner's luck!

01:07:02.414 --> 01:07:04.286
Could've used
this kid as bait!

01:07:07.593 --> 01:07:09.073
You gonna catch
another one
out here?

01:07:09.204 --> 01:07:11.032
We're working on it.

01:07:11.162 --> 01:07:13.382
-  Trying to.
- What's even out there, huh?

01:07:13.512 --> 01:07:15.079
Catfish.

01:07:17.995 --> 01:07:19.431
<i>Hey, Mama.</i>

01:07:20.824 --> 01:07:22.086
<i>I'm home.</i>

01:07:25.872 --> 01:07:29.833
<i>I'm doing somethin' right now
that I think is right.</i>

01:07:29.963 --> 01:07:31.400
<i>I'm helpin' someone.</i>

01:07:34.055 --> 01:07:36.492
<i>I know you're watching over me.</i>

01:07:38.059 --> 01:07:40.496
<i>I'll try and do right by you.</i>

01:07:42.672 --> 01:07:45.675
Anyways, I just wanted
to say I love you.

01:07:48.678 --> 01:07:51.072
I love you more than anything.

01:07:55.424 --> 01:07:59.819
There he is! There's my boy!
You swing, motherfucker!

01:07:59.950 --> 01:08:01.256
Swing it!

01:08:01.386 --> 01:08:03.780
Swing at those fuckin'
fastballs, Cody!

01:08:03.910 --> 01:08:05.869
How many times
I done told you?

01:08:05.999 --> 01:08:08.785
How many times
I done told you?

01:08:08.915 --> 01:08:11.353
- Huh? You swing--
- Hey! What are you
doing here?

01:08:11.483 --> 01:08:15.531
- Hey! How you doin', Dana?
- You can't be here.

01:08:15.661 --> 01:08:17.837
- I can be-- I can watch
my fuckin' boy--
- No, you can't!

01:08:17.968 --> 01:08:19.622
- You can't be here...
- Shut the fuck up!

01:08:19.752 --> 01:08:21.841
- ...and you know it!
- Get the fuck--
I ain't gonna fuckin'--

01:08:21.972 --> 01:08:24.192
- I ain't gonna fuckin'
hurt nobody!
- Don't do this here!

01:08:24.322 --> 01:08:27.282
-  Please, Larry!
- Hey, get over here, boy.

01:08:27.412 --> 01:08:29.936
Hey! You get over here, boy.

01:08:30.067 --> 01:08:32.722
- You don't need
to talk to him, Cody!
- Shut the fuck up!

01:08:32.852 --> 01:08:35.507
You shut up!
Don't talk to him, Cody!

01:08:35.638 --> 01:08:38.206
What you doin' out there,
boy? You swing
at those fastballs.

01:08:38.336 --> 01:08:40.033
- You don't take 'em.
- I'm tryin' to play.

01:08:40.164 --> 01:08:43.428
Look, I'll come down here.
I'll show you how to play.

01:08:43.559 --> 01:08:45.952
- I'll show you how to play.
- I don't need your help.

01:08:47.824 --> 01:08:50.653
That's not
what it looks like, boy.

01:08:50.783 --> 01:08:53.308
Hey... hey!

01:08:53.438 --> 01:08:55.875
- Hey!
-  I ain't
talkin' to you!

01:08:56.006 --> 01:08:57.399
You ain't talkin' to me?

01:08:58.704 --> 01:09:00.184
You ain't talkin' to me?!

01:09:00.315 --> 01:09:03.753
You ain't talkin' to me?!
You ain't talkin' to me?!

01:09:03.883 --> 01:09:05.363
Huh?

01:09:05.494 --> 01:09:08.018
I'm your goddamn father,
motherfucker!

01:09:10.542 --> 01:09:14.024
What kind of boy don't talk
to his own goddamn father?!

01:09:14.155 --> 01:09:17.897
What kind of fuckin' boy don't--
what, motherfucker?

01:09:18.028 --> 01:09:20.509
- What? Sit the fuck down!

01:09:20.639 --> 01:09:24.165
- You ugly-ass,
sorry-ass motherfuckers.

01:09:27.385 --> 01:09:29.822
- Oh, you gon' done
called them again?
-  Yeah, I did.

01:09:29.953 --> 01:09:32.825
You stay right the fuck there.

01:09:32.956 --> 01:09:35.088
- What, you think I was gon'
hit you with this?

01:09:35.219 --> 01:09:37.482
- You think I was gon'
hit you with this?
- I fuckin' know it.

01:09:37.613 --> 01:09:39.441
- Larry!
- Fuck you, Jay.

01:09:39.571 --> 01:09:41.573
Fuck you, Jay.
You don't need
to come down here--

01:09:41.704 --> 01:09:44.576
- Come on,
think about that...
- Come on, come on...

01:09:44.707 --> 01:09:46.709
- Dammit, Larry!

01:09:49.581 --> 01:09:51.931
I'm your goddamn father!

01:09:52.062 --> 01:09:54.456
You're my boy!

01:09:54.586 --> 01:09:56.719
Don't fuckin' listen
to her.

01:09:56.849 --> 01:09:59.156
- She'll ruin
your fuckin' life, son!
- Come on, enough!

01:09:59.287 --> 01:10:01.289
She'll ruin
your fuckin' life!

01:10:08.905 --> 01:10:10.689
What are we
doing here?

01:10:17.043 --> 01:10:19.872
Try not to look at me
when I tell you this.

01:10:25.835 --> 01:10:30.231
I was
in an argument one night
'bout my relationship.

01:10:33.059 --> 01:10:36.237
<i>Done some wrongs,
beat myself up
pretty bad over it.</i>

01:10:38.891 --> 01:10:41.546
<i>Driving around on back roads,</i>

01:10:41.677 --> 01:10:42.808
<i>started drinkin'...</i>

01:10:44.375 --> 01:10:47.813
<i>Drinkin' a lot,
feelin' pretty good...</i>

01:10:47.944 --> 01:10:49.424
<i>Just drivin' the night away.</i>

01:10:51.948 --> 01:10:55.212
<i>All of a sudden,
I get turned around.</i>

01:10:56.866 --> 01:10:58.694
<i>Got lost on the way and...</i>

01:11:00.435 --> 01:11:02.654
started going pretty fast.

01:11:07.398 --> 01:11:10.271
All of a sudden,
I come up over this hill.

01:11:11.794 --> 01:11:14.275
There was a truck
right in the middle
of the road,

01:11:14.405 --> 01:11:15.667
lights off.

01:11:40.823 --> 01:11:42.215
Hi.

01:11:46.698 --> 01:11:48.047
I'm cold.

01:11:49.484 --> 01:11:50.746
Let me get you
my jacket.

01:11:57.492 --> 01:12:01.104
- Hey! Hey!

01:12:02.627 --> 01:12:03.889
- Jason!

01:12:05.543 --> 01:12:07.589
I couldn't slam
on the brakes
fast enough.

01:12:09.460 --> 01:12:13.116
<i>Next thing I know,
my whole left side's
all crushed up...</i>

01:12:13.246 --> 01:12:15.248
- Jason!
- <i>...someone's screaming...</i>

01:12:15.379 --> 01:12:16.815
Jason!

01:12:18.208 --> 01:12:19.644
Help! Please help me!

01:12:19.775 --> 01:12:22.473
<i>And that's
when I left that truck...</i>

01:12:22.604 --> 01:12:25.911
- <i>poor soul that was inside.</i>

01:12:32.309 --> 01:12:35.486
Had a feeling you might know
what I'm talking about here.

01:12:42.972 --> 01:12:44.277
Thought you were in jail.

01:12:45.496 --> 01:12:48.934
Got out a few days ago.

01:13:02.295 --> 01:13:04.036
I hated you.

01:13:07.518 --> 01:13:11.479
Oh, my God, I hated you.
I hated you so fuckin' much.

01:13:13.481 --> 01:13:16.919
I used to pray
every night...

01:13:18.137 --> 01:13:21.010
that somebody
was beatin' you,

01:13:21.140 --> 01:13:22.794
holdin' you down...

01:13:24.970 --> 01:13:27.582
I used to pray for hours.

01:13:29.453 --> 01:13:32.064
And one day,
I just got tired of it.

01:13:32.195 --> 01:13:33.979
I got tired of it,
I got tired of...

01:13:36.808 --> 01:13:39.332
Got too tired
to hate you...

01:13:39.463 --> 01:13:40.899
anymore.

01:13:45.034 --> 01:13:48.603
But then, I was
a long way from here...

01:13:48.733 --> 01:13:50.387
running on fumes.

01:13:50.518 --> 01:13:54.957
Trying to save
my own life...

01:13:57.829 --> 01:13:59.309
save Analee's...

01:14:01.224 --> 01:14:03.618
And you...

01:14:03.748 --> 01:14:05.010
you...

01:14:06.795 --> 01:14:08.361
didn't matter.

01:14:10.015 --> 01:14:11.321
At all.

01:14:12.975 --> 01:14:14.977
How old is Analee, Maben?

01:14:16.848 --> 01:14:18.676
How old
do you think she is?

01:14:20.722 --> 01:14:23.202
Maben, I've been praying
that wasn't the case.

01:14:23.333 --> 01:14:26.945
I swear to God,
I've been praying
that wasn't the case.

01:14:31.602 --> 01:14:34.997
Larry and Walt know?
They know about her?

01:14:37.521 --> 01:14:39.175
Don't see
how they would.

01:14:43.571 --> 01:14:46.791
- Goddamn, I'm sorry.
- No, don't...

01:14:48.314 --> 01:14:52.014
I didn't get to tell you then,
so I'm sayin' it now that I'm--

01:14:52.144 --> 01:14:54.756
- I'm sorry.
- No!

01:14:54.886 --> 01:14:57.019
- I'm sayin' I'm sorry--
- No, you don't get
to apologize

01:14:57.149 --> 01:14:58.847
'cause it don't change nothing.

01:14:58.977 --> 01:15:01.240
It might make you feel
better, but it don't
change nothing.

01:15:01.371 --> 01:15:02.633
It don't make me feel
any better--

01:15:02.764 --> 01:15:05.201
Do not fuckin'
say it again!

01:15:13.035 --> 01:15:15.341
We gotta throw this.

01:15:15.472 --> 01:15:18.170
You think
you can pay for that
with a splash?

01:15:18.301 --> 01:15:20.521
I already paid for it.

01:15:22.261 --> 01:15:24.350
The only person I owe
is that boy

01:15:24.481 --> 01:15:26.614
and I'll be paying
for that soon enough.

01:15:29.138 --> 01:15:32.402
Shit, I believe
everything you say.

01:15:32.533 --> 01:15:34.970
And I'm glad
you shot that asshole.

01:15:35.100 --> 01:15:37.538
I don't know
who he was, but...

01:15:37.668 --> 01:15:40.366
I can see him in my mind.
Shit, I...

01:15:40.497 --> 01:15:42.412
Been many times
I wished I had a gun

01:15:42.543 --> 01:15:44.980
to shoot whoever
had a hold on me.

01:15:45.110 --> 01:15:47.548
Been many times
God heard your prayers

01:15:47.678 --> 01:15:49.158
and He...

01:15:49.288 --> 01:15:53.379
He damn sure answered to you,
be sure He's up there.

01:15:53.510 --> 01:15:55.381
He heard me that time.

01:15:55.512 --> 01:15:57.775
Not no other time.

01:15:59.168 --> 01:16:00.735
Let me ask you...

01:16:03.564 --> 01:16:05.391
Why weren't you
in the truck?

01:16:27.326 --> 01:16:28.763
I guess so...

01:16:31.940 --> 01:16:33.942
so we can be
standing here...

01:16:35.770 --> 01:16:37.206
right now.

01:16:42.428 --> 01:16:44.430
Well, I'll tell you
one thing...

01:16:46.432 --> 01:16:49.392
They're gonna have to kill me
before I go back to prison.

01:16:49.522 --> 01:16:51.612
I know
you already killed once

01:16:51.742 --> 01:16:53.526
when the world
had you by the throat...

01:16:55.441 --> 01:16:58.053
I'll do the same damn thing
before I go back.

01:16:59.794 --> 01:17:01.230
You hear me?

01:17:03.493 --> 01:17:05.538
Wait, um... wait.

01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:11.022
I'll do it.

01:17:15.810 --> 01:17:17.246
Wipe it down.

01:18:02.465 --> 01:18:04.772
What are you
doing here, bud?

01:18:04.902 --> 01:18:07.209
You know me.
Waitin'.

01:18:08.340 --> 01:18:10.865
- Where you been?
- Out at Mitchell's.

01:18:12.475 --> 01:18:14.172
Tell you
I came out there
lookin' for you?

01:18:14.303 --> 01:18:17.959
- Well... found me.
- I have now.

01:18:18.089 --> 01:18:21.571
You know I've been huntin'
for you for a couple
of days, right?

01:18:21.702 --> 01:18:24.530
Why don't you just
tell me what you want?

01:18:24.661 --> 01:18:26.663
We got
a dead cop, Russ.

01:18:26.794 --> 01:18:29.753
Between you and me,
you're the only person
to be seen anywhere near him.

01:18:29.884 --> 01:18:32.451
Now, that don't mean nothing
other than we need
to talk to you,

01:18:32.582 --> 01:18:35.193
but then when I come
lookin' for you, it takes me
two days to find you.

01:18:35.324 --> 01:18:37.805
- So what?
- So where you been at?

01:18:37.935 --> 01:18:40.372
Comin' over here
early in the morning,
late at night.

01:18:40.503 --> 01:18:42.157
Mitchell don't know.

01:18:42.287 --> 01:18:44.202
You need to stop
going out there.

01:18:44.333 --> 01:18:46.248
Then tell me what's going on,
because your name
is not the only name

01:18:46.378 --> 01:18:48.250
that's been comin'
across my desk.

01:18:50.513 --> 01:18:51.644
What's that?

01:18:53.037 --> 01:18:54.647
You don't remember Maben?

01:18:54.778 --> 01:18:56.693
Why should I?

01:18:56.824 --> 01:18:59.043
Because it's the name
of that gal

01:18:59.174 --> 01:19:01.045
that was with Jason
the night that he died.

01:19:01.176 --> 01:19:04.222
Figured a name like that
tied to a night like that,
it might stick.

01:19:04.353 --> 01:19:06.747
I tried to forget all that.
Why are you showing me this?

01:19:10.054 --> 01:19:14.319
A woman named Maben came
into the shelter downtown
with a little girl.

01:19:14.450 --> 01:19:16.582
The lady working there said
she found a pistol on her

01:19:16.713 --> 01:19:18.236
before she took off running.

01:19:18.367 --> 01:19:19.803
Now I know the last name
is made up,

01:19:19.934 --> 01:19:22.806
but it's really hard
to make up a name like Maben.

01:19:24.590 --> 01:19:25.722
Tell me
where you've been at.

01:19:25.853 --> 01:19:28.159
Look, you probably
just missed me.

01:19:28.290 --> 01:19:30.509
Been out at Mitchell's.

01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:33.599
Larry's come by here,
busted out all my goddamn
windows and doors,

01:19:33.730 --> 01:19:36.472
I ain't just gonna sit
around here waitin'
for his ass to show up.

01:19:40.258 --> 01:19:41.694
Okay.

01:19:41.825 --> 01:19:43.609
You don't mind if I ask
Mitchell, do you?

01:19:43.740 --> 01:19:46.003
I just wanna clear your name,
so the department lays off me.

01:19:46.134 --> 01:19:48.571
Of course, go ahead.
Just call 'im first.

01:19:48.701 --> 01:19:51.139
Don't just go
showing up out there.

01:19:51.269 --> 01:19:53.489
Feel like enough burden
as it is.

01:19:53.619 --> 01:19:55.360
All right, I hear you.
I hear you.

01:19:55.491 --> 01:19:57.319
You know I hate
asking you these things, right?

01:19:57.449 --> 01:19:59.451
Yeah, whatever
you say, bud.

01:20:00.975 --> 01:20:02.150
Love you.

01:20:03.891 --> 01:20:06.110
I'll pay you back
for that bail.

01:20:06.241 --> 01:20:08.069
That's what you said
last time.

01:20:08.199 --> 01:20:10.506
- Hey, come here.
- What? What?!

01:20:12.116 --> 01:20:15.816
- Dude, what happened, man?
- It don't matter.

01:20:15.946 --> 01:20:18.775
- No, it... it does.
- What's the matter, motherfucker?

01:20:20.777 --> 01:20:22.344
I'm worried about you.

01:20:24.128 --> 01:20:27.349
Look, it's j--
it's just us, man.

01:20:27.479 --> 01:20:29.481
We're all that's left,
do you hear me?

01:20:31.353 --> 01:20:33.529
It don't--
It ain't gon'
bring him back.

01:20:33.659 --> 01:20:36.358
You gotta let him go, Larry.
It ain't gonna bring him back.

01:20:36.488 --> 01:20:38.403
You fuckin' one of them now.
You're one of them now.

01:20:38.534 --> 01:20:40.666
Don't say that shit, man.

01:20:40.797 --> 01:20:42.190
- Fuck you, man.
- Come on, man.

01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:44.192
- Don't say that shit, dude.

01:20:44.322 --> 01:20:46.759
- Get the fuck out of here!
- Hey, you gotta calm down!

01:20:46.890 --> 01:20:48.587
You never had my back,
motherfucker!

01:20:48.718 --> 01:20:50.241
Get the fuck out of here!

01:20:51.242 --> 01:20:52.722
Come on, man!

01:20:52.853 --> 01:20:55.638
- Pussy-ass motherfucker.
- Get back over here, man.

01:20:55.768 --> 01:20:58.859
Talk to me!
I'm your brother!

01:20:58.989 --> 01:21:00.512
Fuckin' all there is

01:21:00.643 --> 01:21:03.864
- is out here,
talkin' to myself.

01:21:03.994 --> 01:21:06.214
Just out here,
talkin' to myself.

01:21:20.663 --> 01:21:22.317
Cody on first...

01:21:23.796 --> 01:21:26.756
Jason on second,
Walt's on third.

01:21:26.887 --> 01:21:30.151
What's he do--
he's callin' it!

01:21:30.281 --> 01:21:31.848
He's callin' it, y'all.

01:21:33.241 --> 01:21:34.372
Swings...

01:21:34.503 --> 01:21:37.071
- Fly fuckin' ball!

01:21:37.201 --> 01:21:39.464
It's out of here!

01:21:39.595 --> 01:21:43.338
He's callin' it, playing
to the fuckin' crowd.

01:21:46.515 --> 01:21:48.082
He's making his way.

01:22:01.965 --> 01:22:03.053
He's making...

01:24:57.097 --> 01:24:58.707
- Hey! <i>Â¿QuÃ© pasÃ³?</i>
- Oh, shit, lady!

01:24:58.837 --> 01:25:00.491
- I was just looking
for Mitchell.
- <i>PÃ¡rele.</i>

01:25:00.622 --> 01:25:02.145
- <i>Usted no puede estar acÃ¡.</i>
- Okay. Relax.

01:25:02.276 --> 01:25:03.625
- Relax!
- <i>VÃ¡yase. Fuera de acÃ¡ ya.</i>

01:25:03.755 --> 01:25:05.540
Settle down, okay?
Settle down,
I'm leaving.

01:25:05.670 --> 01:25:09.413
- <i>Voy a llamar a la policÃ­a.</i>
- I am the damn police.

01:25:09.544 --> 01:25:10.719
How you doin', Boyd?

01:25:10.849 --> 01:25:12.286
I mean, I wasn't
plannin' on sellin',

01:25:12.416 --> 01:25:14.940
but, uh, feel free
to have a look around.

01:25:15.071 --> 01:25:17.247
Knocked
on the front door first.
Didn't hear anything.

01:25:17.378 --> 01:25:19.467
Thought I heard you out back,
so I went looking for you.

01:25:19.597 --> 01:25:23.210
Well, you were
on the ball, Deputy.
Everything all right?

01:25:23.340 --> 01:25:24.907
I just need to know

01:25:25.037 --> 01:25:26.604
if Russell stayed here
with you the night
before last.

01:25:26.735 --> 01:25:28.519
- Yeah, he did.
- All night?

01:25:28.650 --> 01:25:31.174
Well, I didn't set up
all night watching him
snore or nothing,

01:25:31.305 --> 01:25:33.176
but, uh, as far as I know,
he was here.

01:25:33.307 --> 01:25:35.091
Okay, good. Anyone else
can attest to that?

01:25:35.222 --> 01:25:37.137
Well, um,
you musta seen 'im.

01:25:37.267 --> 01:25:38.834
Yes, I can.

01:25:38.964 --> 01:25:42.098
You speak English. Okay.

01:25:42.229 --> 01:25:44.144
Yeah, she'll do that... sometimes.

01:25:45.928 --> 01:25:48.060
All right.
Thank you.

01:25:50.106 --> 01:25:52.064
Have a nice day, Deputy.

01:26:07.036 --> 01:26:09.647
-  Shit.

01:26:18.700 --> 01:26:20.658
You're lyin' to me
about where you've been.

01:26:20.789 --> 01:26:21.964
Your whole family is!

01:26:22.094 --> 01:26:23.705
What I can't
understand is why.

01:26:25.315 --> 01:26:28.318
It don't matter what I say.
You got some big idea.

01:26:28.449 --> 01:26:31.539
Call it a big idea,
call it whatever you want.

01:26:31.669 --> 01:26:34.019
I'm here so you can talk
to me, man. Me!

01:26:34.150 --> 01:26:35.282
Without talking
to nobody else,

01:26:35.412 --> 01:26:37.066
but you're not making it
easy on me.

01:26:37.197 --> 01:26:38.459
Now when I get
to that office,

01:26:38.589 --> 01:26:40.200
I'm gonna tell
about not being able
to find you

01:26:40.330 --> 01:26:42.419
and about this woman
named Maben, who has
a pistol on her,

01:26:42.550 --> 01:26:44.073
because you're leaving me
no damn choice.

01:26:44.204 --> 01:26:45.944
Just because
you didn't see me
lay down in bed

01:26:46.075 --> 01:26:47.511
don't mean
I didn't sleep in it.

01:26:47.642 --> 01:26:49.644
Russell, there's ways
of getting to whatever it is

01:26:49.774 --> 01:26:51.167
you seem to be
dancing around, man.

01:26:51.298 --> 01:26:52.255
Talk to me!

01:26:52.386 --> 01:26:53.822
Then put the cuffs on me.

01:26:54.866 --> 01:26:55.954
Or get the hell out of here.

01:26:58.609 --> 01:27:00.524
Not until you answer me
like I want.

01:27:02.787 --> 01:27:04.093
All right.

01:27:06.617 --> 01:27:09.141
You don't wanna leave?
I will.

01:27:12.841 --> 01:27:15.452
Wanna arrest me?
Arrest me.

01:27:19.804 --> 01:27:21.806
Get the hell out
of my damn house.

01:27:33.209 --> 01:27:34.297
Where's Mitchell?

01:27:34.428 --> 01:27:35.559
Yeah, you and me
got to talk.

01:27:35.690 --> 01:27:37.039
Boyd was back here
snoopin' around--

01:27:37.169 --> 01:27:38.475
He see Maben or Analee?

01:27:38.606 --> 01:27:41.652
-  Very close.
- What did you call her?

01:27:43.480 --> 01:27:45.177
You heard me.

01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:54.230
<i>You're gonna have to go.</i>

01:27:54.361 --> 01:27:56.363
We're not talking
about forever here, Maben.

01:27:56.493 --> 01:27:58.887
- We're talking about
a couple of weeks, okay?
- Yeah.

01:28:01.324 --> 01:28:04.109
Yeah.

01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:05.546
Just a--

01:28:05.676 --> 01:28:07.156
Just a couple of weeks.

01:28:07.287 --> 01:28:09.289
Hey, I don't see
any other way around it.

01:28:11.813 --> 01:28:13.902
Been livin' that way
for a while.

01:28:28.264 --> 01:28:29.918
We'll just sit out here.

01:28:31.702 --> 01:28:33.313
Let the sun go down.

01:28:34.923 --> 01:28:36.620
I bought you a bus ticket.

01:28:39.536 --> 01:28:42.017
There's one heading out
late tonight.

01:28:42.147 --> 01:28:45.586
It'll take you to Memphis,
you just get off
wherever you feel.

01:28:45.716 --> 01:28:48.763
I got you money too,
it's just all over
at the house.

01:28:48.893 --> 01:28:51.679
No. I don't need
your money.

01:28:51.809 --> 01:28:53.463
I know you don't.

01:28:55.073 --> 01:28:56.814
I don't need you
to give me nothin'.

01:28:56.945 --> 01:28:59.034
I know I don't have to.

01:29:00.470 --> 01:29:02.472
Seems like you and I...

01:29:04.779 --> 01:29:07.782
we're tied together
by some sort
of invisible rope,

01:29:07.912 --> 01:29:09.784
and it's always been there.

01:29:09.914 --> 01:29:11.916
It ain't lettin' us go.

01:29:16.051 --> 01:29:19.228
That girl's gonna be
damn fine sittin' here.

01:29:19.359 --> 01:29:21.404
You gotta get out of here,
you gotta be safe.

01:29:21.535 --> 01:29:25.103
You gotta be safe for you,
you gotta be safe for her.

01:29:25.234 --> 01:29:26.975
And I promise you

01:29:27.105 --> 01:29:29.717
I ain't gonna let
a damn thing happen to her.

01:29:32.241 --> 01:29:34.461
- I promise you.

01:29:35.766 --> 01:29:37.768
I promise you.

01:30:00.530 --> 01:30:02.184
Just a little bruise.

01:30:21.551 --> 01:30:22.726
Pull it.

01:30:22.857 --> 01:30:25.337
Come on, motherfucker.

01:30:45.401 --> 01:30:47.621
You fuckin' pussy.

01:30:53.017 --> 01:30:54.366
Ah...

01:30:57.413 --> 01:30:59.067
It's gonna hurt.

01:31:01.156 --> 01:31:03.158
It's gonna fuckin' hurt.

01:31:07.684 --> 01:31:11.383
We'll take
good care of her,
don't you worry.

01:31:11.514 --> 01:31:13.777
You wanna wake up Analee,

01:31:13.908 --> 01:31:16.127
say goodbye to her
before we take off?

01:31:20.480 --> 01:31:22.656
I fuckin' told her
I'd never leave her

01:31:22.786 --> 01:31:24.484
and here I go,
leaving her.

01:31:27.312 --> 01:31:29.314
Every single fuckin' thing
I've done wrong,

01:31:29.445 --> 01:31:32.492
I've brought down
on that little girl.

01:31:32.622 --> 01:31:35.146
Hey, life's a whirlwind.
We're all caught up in it.

01:31:35.277 --> 01:31:36.887
You're a good mama.

01:31:37.018 --> 01:31:39.324
Hell, anyone can see how much
you love that little girl,

01:31:39.455 --> 01:31:41.022
you love her so bad,
it hurts.

01:31:41.152 --> 01:31:43.894
And if it didn't hurt,
you wouldn't be
doing it right.

01:31:44.025 --> 01:31:46.506
That hurt never goes away,
it doesn't matter
how old they get.

01:31:48.986 --> 01:31:52.207
Just do the best you can
for right now,

01:31:52.337 --> 01:31:54.514
and you don't worry
about tomorrow
until it comes.

01:31:59.344 --> 01:32:00.563
You're doing
the right thing.

01:32:08.049 --> 01:32:10.181
- Take care of her.
- Oh, yeah.

01:32:12.401 --> 01:32:13.576
Ahem.

01:33:33.134 --> 01:33:34.439
Coast's clear.

01:33:36.006 --> 01:33:37.529
I've got everything
ready here.

01:33:37.660 --> 01:33:39.662
Got you a bunch of supplies.

01:33:39.793 --> 01:33:41.490
Can I use your bathroom?

01:33:41.621 --> 01:33:42.970
Sure, down the hall.

01:33:48.540 --> 01:33:49.498
Maben!

01:34:03.251 --> 01:34:05.688
- That's all you've got?
-  Yeah!

01:34:09.213 --> 01:34:10.519
Motherfucker!

01:34:20.094 --> 01:34:24.098
You killed the wrong one.
You ain't fucking perfect.

01:34:24.228 --> 01:34:26.274
You should've killed me.

01:34:34.282 --> 01:34:35.675
It's over now, boy.

01:34:46.816 --> 01:34:49.601
I've been waitin'
seven fuckin' years
for this.

01:34:57.044 --> 01:35:00.134
- You okay, son?

01:35:00.264 --> 01:35:01.831
Dammit, Larry,
I'm sorry.

01:35:01.962 --> 01:35:04.138
Why don't you sit down, son?
I'll call you an ambulance.

01:35:14.365 --> 01:35:15.323
Maben!

01:35:15.453 --> 01:35:17.673
Maben!

01:35:19.370 --> 01:35:20.676
Goddammit, Mitchell!

01:35:20.807 --> 01:35:22.417
I told you to stay
the hell out of this shit.

01:35:22.547 --> 01:35:24.419
- You can damn me later.

01:35:24.549 --> 01:35:26.029
We gotta get her
the hell outta here.

01:35:27.727 --> 01:35:29.772
Damn, I knew
he'd do something wrong.

01:35:33.167 --> 01:35:34.168
Careful there.

01:35:35.865 --> 01:35:37.258
Be safe, son.

01:35:37.388 --> 01:35:38.825
Get home!

01:35:38.955 --> 01:35:41.088
- Get rid
of that fuckin' gun!
- Yeah, yeah.

01:36:08.942 --> 01:36:10.160
Come here, boy.

01:36:11.858 --> 01:36:13.163
Cody...

01:36:15.122 --> 01:36:16.776
Cody, boy...

01:36:19.430 --> 01:36:20.605
Cody...

01:36:20.736 --> 01:36:24.435
Cody!

01:36:28.004 --> 01:36:29.701
Jesus Christ, Larry...

01:36:31.007 --> 01:36:33.096
- Where is my son?
- What happened to you?

01:36:33.227 --> 01:36:35.011
- Who did this to you?
- Where is he?

01:36:35.142 --> 01:36:36.883
- Larry...
- Mom, what the fuck's
going on?

01:36:37.013 --> 01:36:38.449
- Go call 911!
- Why is he here?

01:36:38.580 --> 01:36:39.886
- Dad, why the fuck
are you here?
- Call 911!

01:36:40.016 --> 01:36:42.584
- Why? What's going on?

01:36:42.714 --> 01:36:45.543
- Is he fuckin' bleeding?
Why are you bleeding?
- Go call 911, Cody!

01:36:45.674 --> 01:36:47.589
- He needs help!
- Go call!

01:36:47.719 --> 01:36:50.897
Come here, boy...
Let me touch my son.

01:36:51.027 --> 01:36:53.203
Larry,
don't move, please. Okay?

01:36:53.334 --> 01:36:55.379
- Try not to move, Larry--
- Get the fuck away from me.

01:36:55.510 --> 01:36:57.468
- Goddammit.
Hey, listen.

01:36:57.599 --> 01:37:00.080
Stay right there,
okay? Don't move!

01:37:00.210 --> 01:37:04.432
- Imma get you help...
- You all did this to me.

01:37:04.562 --> 01:37:07.827
You all did it.
You all did it.

01:37:21.144 --> 01:37:23.451
-  Hey, you can't go!
-  Dad,
what are you doing?

01:37:23.581 --> 01:37:24.844
Dad, stop!
Where are you going?

01:37:24.974 --> 01:37:27.759
You can't drive like that,
Larry! Come on!

01:37:27.890 --> 01:37:31.111
Oh, shit, he's driving!
He's driving!

01:37:31.241 --> 01:37:33.635
Please hurry!

01:37:33.765 --> 01:37:34.941
Help!

01:37:36.246 --> 01:37:37.726
Somebody help!

01:37:43.036 --> 01:37:45.038
Somebody help us!

01:37:48.345 --> 01:37:51.479
Maben... we're here.

01:37:51.609 --> 01:37:54.177
-  What happened?
- She-- she fell. She...

01:37:54.308 --> 01:37:55.962
hit her head.
Her head flipped back.

01:38:45.315 --> 01:38:47.187
I heard your address
on the wire. Shots fired?

01:38:48.753 --> 01:38:50.277
Hell yeah,
shots fired.

01:38:50.407 --> 01:38:51.626
What the hell happened?

01:38:55.108 --> 01:38:58.633
Walked in my place,
Larry was there.

01:38:58.763 --> 01:39:00.374
Had a woman with me,

01:39:00.504 --> 01:39:03.203
he hit her over the head
with a crowbar thinkin'
it was me.

01:39:03.333 --> 01:39:04.508
Him and I got into it,

01:39:04.639 --> 01:39:07.424
I got ahold of my rifle
and I shot 'im.

01:39:09.122 --> 01:39:10.340
Who is she, Russ?

01:39:12.255 --> 01:39:14.475
You know goddamn well
who she is.

01:39:20.307 --> 01:39:22.613
Russ, you gotta tell me.

01:39:22.744 --> 01:39:25.094
What the hell you got
to do with all this?

01:39:28.793 --> 01:39:30.795
I'll explain
everything to you.

01:39:32.406 --> 01:39:35.017
You gotta promise me
you ain't gonna listen to me
like a lawman.

01:39:35.148 --> 01:39:36.671
What do you want me
to listen to you like?

01:39:36.801 --> 01:39:38.760
I want you to listen to me
like you're you...

01:39:40.370 --> 01:39:41.632
and I'm me.

01:39:47.769 --> 01:39:49.423
Okay. Okay.

01:39:59.607 --> 01:40:02.001
<i>The pistol
you're looking for
is over in the lake.</i>

01:40:02.131 --> 01:40:04.003
<i>Same one Maben held on me</i>

01:40:04.133 --> 01:40:07.223
<i>when I walked out
of the Armadillo
a few nights ago.</i>

01:40:07.354 --> 01:40:11.314
<i>That's when she got to talkin'
about how some deputy</i>

01:40:11.445 --> 01:40:14.230
<i>made her do everything
that he wanted her to do,</i>

01:40:14.361 --> 01:40:16.232
<i>even called
his goddamned friends along</i>

01:40:16.363 --> 01:40:18.365
<i>to come have a go at her too.</i>

01:40:18.495 --> 01:40:21.150
Next thing she knew,
he was down, dead,
and she kept on runnin',

01:40:21.281 --> 01:40:23.239
kept on runnin' straight
until she ran into me.

01:40:25.285 --> 01:40:27.635
Why the hell didn't you
and her just both
come straight to me?

01:40:29.767 --> 01:40:32.379
Nobody would've believed her
and you know it, Boyd.

01:40:35.556 --> 01:40:37.210
She'da lost the kid.

01:40:37.340 --> 01:40:40.300
And I'll be goddamned,
but I believe
everything she says.

01:40:42.867 --> 01:40:44.521
My road's the road
that brought us all here,

01:40:44.652 --> 01:40:46.697
led by what hand,
I don't know.

01:40:46.828 --> 01:40:49.831
But here we are,
and I ain't lettin' this go.

01:40:49.961 --> 01:40:51.876
Shit, I'm only telling you
all this so you know

01:40:52.007 --> 01:40:54.096
when I ask you
just leave her alone.

01:40:54.227 --> 01:40:56.055
I ain't tellin' you,
I'm askin' you.

01:40:58.796 --> 01:41:00.320
Just let it fall.

01:41:01.625 --> 01:41:02.974
Let it fall?

01:41:04.715 --> 01:41:07.196
Just let it fall.

01:41:07.327 --> 01:41:09.720
Do you know
who's at my house
right now?

01:41:12.332 --> 01:41:14.334
Yes, I do.

01:41:14.464 --> 01:41:16.858
And do you know what the boys
at Parchman would do
to a sheriff's deputy?

01:41:16.988 --> 01:41:19.252
Huh? It'd make your time
look like summer camp.

01:41:27.912 --> 01:41:29.914
Where's the proof,
Russell?

01:42:13.132 --> 01:42:14.524
What does that
look like to you?

01:43:16.020 --> 01:43:19.285
<i>The days are slow.</i>

01:43:19.415 --> 01:43:21.896
<i>They get that way
when you're waiting
on something to happen</i>

01:43:22.026 --> 01:43:23.637
<i>that you hope never will.</i>

01:43:28.772 --> 01:43:31.340
<i>You can't help but wonder
if today is the day...</i>

01:43:33.386 --> 01:43:35.518
<i>they'll be sittin' there,</i>

01:43:35.649 --> 01:43:38.478
<i>then here they come,
over that hill,</i>

01:43:38.608 --> 01:43:42.830
<i>down the driveway,
lights flashing,</i>

01:43:42.960 --> 01:43:44.962
<i>sirens calling out your name.</i>

01:43:47.226 --> 01:43:49.053
<i>Russell told me
about this dream</i>

01:43:49.184 --> 01:43:52.274
<i>of being back on the inside,</i>

01:43:52.405 --> 01:43:54.450
<i>about how the light
was always grey,</i>

01:43:56.060 --> 01:43:58.411
<i>and there was always
this voice calling out...</i>

01:44:00.848 --> 01:44:02.458
<i>Just some cry,</i>

01:44:02.589 --> 01:44:04.591
<i>echoing through
an empty prison...</i>

01:44:07.637 --> 01:44:09.813
<i>and he never knew
what he was supposed to do.</i>

01:44:11.772 --> 01:44:14.209
<i>If he was supposed
to be helping it, or...</i>

01:44:15.689 --> 01:44:17.386
<i>if it was there to help him.</i>

01:44:25.916 --> 01:44:28.005
<i>Sometimes I think it was me
he was hearing...</i>

01:44:39.582 --> 01:44:42.281
<i>I don't guess there's no way
of knowing what's coming.</i>

01:44:46.110 --> 01:44:49.113
<i>Never has been.
Never will be.</i>

01:44:52.247 --> 01:44:53.509
<i>But, for once,</i>

01:44:54.989 --> 01:44:56.207
<i>I'm not afraid.</i>

01:45:28.152 --> 01:45:30.154
<i>And when the daylight fades,</i>

01:45:32.243 --> 01:45:34.637
<i>and it seems okay
to breathe a little...</i>

01:45:39.163 --> 01:45:40.730
<i>that low light</i>

01:45:41.731 --> 01:45:44.212
<i>gives her this long shadow,</i>

01:45:44.343 --> 01:45:46.345
<i>like her arms are spread out.</i>

01:45:48.521 --> 01:45:50.218
<i>As if she's saying,</i>

01:45:50.349 --> 01:45:53.177
<i>"Come here
and let me hold you..."</i>

01:45:57.312 --> 01:45:58.748
<i>I don't know...</i>

01:45:58.879 --> 01:46:01.795
- Get-- get up! Get up!
Here, stand up.

01:46:01.925 --> 01:46:04.711
<i>Maybe there is
such a thing as a miracle.</i>

01:46:04.841 --> 01:46:06.713
I got you.

01:46:18.159 --> 01:46:20.161
<i>All I know for certain...</i>

01:46:23.860 --> 01:46:25.296
<i>she's mine.</i>
