WEBVTT

00:04.288 --> 00:06.266
Don't you dare.

00:06.290 --> 00:08.676
Kate, I'm warning you. Don't.

00:10.461 --> 00:11.438
Aah!

00:11.462 --> 00:12.439
That's it.

00:12.463 --> 00:14.390
That's it.

00:17.218 --> 00:18.946
Okay, okay. I give up. I give
up, I give up, I give up.

00:18.970 --> 00:22.189
You know, California is still
officially in a drought.

00:22.598 --> 00:24.284
- You want a soda?
- I'll get it.

00:24.308 --> 00:25.484
It's okay.

00:26.686 --> 00:28.622
Don't you have practice
or something, Claud?

00:28.646 --> 00:30.739
I already practiced
for two hours.

00:30.815 --> 00:32.375
She knows where the glasses are?

00:32.400 --> 00:35.369
How about if we make it
water instead of soda?

00:35.611 --> 00:37.663
I think you've already got
enough sugar in your diet.

00:37.905 --> 00:39.582
Bailey hates water.

00:39.657 --> 00:42.418
He hates any liquid without
bubbles or artificial flavoring.

00:42.660 --> 00:45.806
In fact, once, he drank a
whole gallon of Mountain Dew

00:45.830 --> 00:46.765
and puked all over...

00:46.789 --> 00:48.058
I love water.

00:48.082 --> 00:49.633
Water is the source of all life.

00:50.793 --> 00:52.136
It's nature's miracle.

00:52.420 --> 00:53.981
That's very poetic.

00:54.005 --> 00:57.516
Really? It was completely spontaneous.
I didn't even think.

00:57.675 --> 00:59.153
I love it when you don't think.

00:59.177 --> 01:01.187
That's one of his
best qualities.

01:01.971 --> 01:03.522
Isn't it past your bedtime?

01:05.391 --> 01:07.485
<i>As it should be...</i>

01:07.977 --> 01:09.195
Yes!

01:09.353 --> 01:10.946
The Niners won.

01:14.567 --> 01:15.627
I'm heading home.

01:15.651 --> 01:17.161
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:17.403 --> 01:18.839
Why don't you spend
the night here?

01:18.863 --> 01:19.840
Charlie.

01:19.864 --> 01:23.000
Come on, you're tired, and you
don't want to drive home.

01:23.659 --> 01:25.679
I'll let you sleep on the
good side of the bed.

01:25.703 --> 01:27.463
The one without the
cracker crumbs.

01:29.248 --> 01:30.809
We've been over this.

01:30.833 --> 01:32.092
Well, I don't get it.

01:32.126 --> 01:36.315
You're worried about our relationship interfering
with taking care of Owen, and it hasn't.

01:36.339 --> 01:39.642
We're just gonna go over
to your place, right?

01:40.259 --> 01:43.312
Go to bed, get up in the morning,
and come back over here,

01:43.930 --> 01:47.024
so why don't we not make
life easier on ourselves?

01:47.808 --> 01:50.110
I'll let you wear my pajamas
with the feet in them.

01:50.561 --> 01:52.279
What about the others?

01:52.480 --> 01:53.948
They can get their own pajamas.

01:55.483 --> 01:58.253
You think it matters to them
whether you spend the night?

01:58.277 --> 01:59.671
In fact, it'd probably
make Claud happy

01:59.695 --> 02:01.580
knowing that we're
both in the house.

02:01.781 --> 02:03.541
I don't know, Charlie.

02:04.158 --> 02:07.336
I mean, I start spending the night, the next
thing you know, I'm practically living here.

02:08.246 --> 02:10.881
Come on. I'll make you
breakfast in bed.

02:11.165 --> 02:12.142
Charlie...

02:12.166 --> 02:13.342
Stay.

02:14.252 --> 02:15.594
I want you to.

02:17.421 --> 02:18.806
Okay.

02:20.000 --> 02:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:27.640 --> 02:28.992
What's the tally?

02:29.016 --> 02:30.244
$32.50.

02:30.268 --> 02:31.912
How come nobody
ever tips the band?

02:31.936 --> 02:34.905
Probably because the singer can't
remember a lyric to save his life.

02:35.523 --> 02:37.575
I had something on
my mind tonight.

02:37.608 --> 02:40.828
Right. five bucks says the
same thing happens tomorrow.

02:40.861 --> 02:41.797
Fine. You're on.

02:41.821 --> 02:43.215
Wait. I want a piece of that.

02:43.239 --> 02:44.540
Oh.

02:44.573 --> 02:45.717
Are you in, Julia?

02:45.741 --> 02:47.084
Oh, what the hell. Easy money.

02:47.285 --> 02:49.054
It's a lot harder than it looks.

02:49.078 --> 02:51.431
Yeah, right. I know more lyrics
than you do, and I'm a barmaid.

02:51.455 --> 02:53.007
Not that there's anything
wrong with that.

02:53.207 --> 02:55.843
Okay, Martin, pop quiz.
You ready?

02:56.377 --> 02:57.562
Go for it, baby.

02:57.586 --> 02:59.138
Here we go.

02:59.922 --> 03:01.348
I know it.

03:02.383 --> 03:06.154

03:06.178 --> 03:10.816

04:21.420 --> 04:22.606
All right! See?

04:22.630 --> 04:23.523
You almost got the words.

04:23.547 --> 04:25.015
That's how you're
supposed to do it.

04:25.466 --> 04:26.600
What's the matter with you?

04:32.056 --> 04:36.620
<i>♪ Everybody wants to live

04:36.644 --> 04:41.281

<i>♪ Everybody wants to

05:13.681 --> 05:15.117
Very hip shades.

05:15.141 --> 05:18.402
There's a partial solar eclipse
in exactly 24 minutes.

05:19.353 --> 05:20.455
Have you seen Bailey?

05:20.479 --> 05:21.790
Can't say that I have.

05:21.814 --> 05:23.333
We're going to the exploratorium

05:23.357 --> 05:25.377
to watch through
the big telescope.

05:25.401 --> 05:27.286
- It's a special event.
- Great.

05:27.486 --> 05:29.913
I want to see as much of
the umbra as possible.

05:31.365 --> 05:34.001
Umbra's the shadow of
the moon over the sun.

05:34.118 --> 05:35.429
If we get there early enough,

05:35.453 --> 05:38.046
we'll be able to see every
phase of light and shadow.

05:39.832 --> 05:40.966
Hmm.

05:43.711 --> 05:45.480
You want me to take you?

05:45.504 --> 05:47.264
I promised Bailey.

05:47.965 --> 05:50.851
We could still see the
last crescent phases,

05:51.594 --> 05:53.770
if he gets here right now.

05:56.390 --> 05:58.150
Or in the next minute.

06:00.853 --> 06:02.112
In ancient times,

06:02.188 --> 06:04.448
people thought
eclipses were an omen.

06:06.108 --> 06:08.494
A sign that something bad
was about to happen.

06:08.861 --> 06:11.830
You know, like locusts
or something.

06:17.786 --> 06:20.422
I hope something awful
didn't happen to him.

06:21.081 --> 06:23.008
To Bailey? He's out
with Kate somewhere.

06:28.797 --> 06:30.942
Can I be honest with you?

06:30.966 --> 06:34.394
I mean, totally, completely,
100 percent honest?

06:36.513 --> 06:39.326
I'm not a big one for
poetry readings.

06:39.350 --> 06:42.361
It's not a poetry reading. It's
more like performance art.

06:43.145 --> 06:45.948
Is there nudity in it?
Because if there isn't...

06:47.191 --> 06:48.742
What's this?

06:49.360 --> 06:51.828
Uh, isn't that yours?

06:52.863 --> 06:54.498
"Nearly nude."

06:54.865 --> 06:56.593
Nope.

06:56.617 --> 06:58.178
You sure? I think it's yours.

06:58.202 --> 06:59.387
Trust me on this one.

06:59.411 --> 07:02.214
If it's not hypo-allergenic,
I puff up like a blow fish.

07:05.084 --> 07:09.064
So, what woman was
reapplying her lipstick

07:09.088 --> 07:11.348
in the cab of your
truck, Charlie, huh?

07:11.966 --> 07:14.268
Would you look at the way
this clown is driving?

07:15.761 --> 07:17.697
Not one of your old girlfriends?

07:17.721 --> 07:20.065
Not... Rebecca?

07:22.059 --> 07:24.444
You know, maybe
it was Rebecca's.

07:25.479 --> 07:26.498
I was kidding.

07:26.522 --> 07:28.323
What was she doing
in your truck?

07:28.816 --> 07:31.044
Oh, that time we had dinner.
I gave her a lift home.

07:31.068 --> 07:33.036
Really? Where was her husband?

07:33.445 --> 07:35.998
I mean, I gave both
of them a lift home.

07:36.323 --> 07:38.468
He left his, like,
his map light on,

07:38.492 --> 07:42.796
and his battery drained down, so I gave
them both a lift home. Both of them.

07:46.917 --> 07:49.428
Three people in the cab
of this truck, huh?

07:50.713 --> 07:53.390
Should I take Grant or Columbus?

07:59.138 --> 08:01.398
Don't you always carry
jumper cables in the back?

08:02.600 --> 08:04.651
Why are you making such
a big deal of this?

08:05.978 --> 08:09.364
Don't you always carry
jumper cables, Charlie?

08:11.942 --> 08:13.160
What?

08:15.154 --> 08:16.455
You slept with her.

08:17.615 --> 08:19.551
What are you talking about?

08:19.575 --> 08:21.209
You did, didn't you?

08:21.327 --> 08:25.473
You find lipstick in the car, and that
automatically means that I... You actually...

08:25.497 --> 08:26.673
Yes!

08:27.166 --> 08:28.926
Well, I don't know
what to say to that.

08:30.377 --> 08:32.596
I swear, I did not
sleep with her.

08:38.969 --> 08:41.563
You know what? It
wasn't the battery.

08:42.264 --> 08:44.483
It was some kind
of ignition thing.

08:44.516 --> 08:46.620
So I forgot the specifics.

08:46.644 --> 08:48.946
God, that was... That
was two weeks ago.

08:49.146 --> 08:50.123
That doesn't mean I...

08:50.147 --> 08:51.791
- Stop the car.
- What?

08:51.815 --> 08:53.867
I said, stop the car!

08:58.072 --> 09:00.008
Are you crazy? Come back here.

09:00.032 --> 09:01.625
Kirsten! Where are you going?

09:01.659 --> 09:04.387
Kirsten, get back in the car.
Jeez...

09:04.411 --> 09:06.588
...Hey, come on, buddy, move it!

09:19.968 --> 09:21.404
- Whatever's on tap.
- Yeah.

09:21.428 --> 09:23.480
- Hey, you got a phone?
- Over there.

09:25.599 --> 09:26.493
You're crazy!

09:26.517 --> 09:27.494
Come on. It'd be great.

09:27.518 --> 09:28.828
I mean, when Martin
screws up the lyrics,

09:28.852 --> 09:30.372
you'll be right there
singing backup.

09:30.396 --> 09:32.489
Forget it. I'm not getting
up on that stage.

09:33.315 --> 09:35.325
Listen, are you there?
Would you pick up, please?

09:35.901 --> 09:37.995
Come on, Kirsten. At
least talk to me.

09:39.321 --> 09:40.872
Look, I just think...

09:42.157 --> 09:43.792
Just call me at home, okay?

09:44.910 --> 09:45.887
You sure?

09:45.911 --> 09:47.212
No way!

09:47.413 --> 09:50.100
Can you stand in front with big, like,
cue cards or something to help him?

09:50.124 --> 09:51.383
No. Just go away.

09:53.377 --> 09:54.511
Julia!

09:55.254 --> 09:56.805
Charlie, what are
you doing here?

09:56.880 --> 09:57.941
You're asking me that?

09:57.965 --> 09:59.850
Look, I'm just here
with friends, okay?

09:59.883 --> 10:01.695
Julia, screwdriver, right?

10:01.719 --> 10:02.779
Yeah.

10:02.803 --> 10:03.979
No!

10:05.514 --> 10:06.700
A screwdriver? You're drinking?

10:06.724 --> 10:08.576
Charlie, just don't
embarrass me, okay?

10:08.600 --> 10:09.494
Come on. We're going home.

10:09.518 --> 10:10.495
- No!
- Julia!

10:10.519 --> 10:11.454
Let go of me!

10:11.478 --> 10:12.455
Are you okay, Julia?

10:12.479 --> 10:14.040
- She's fine!
- Hey, what's going on here?

10:14.064 --> 10:15.041
None of your business.

10:15.065 --> 10:16.376
The hell it ain't, pal.

10:16.400 --> 10:17.909
Come on, let's take a walk.

10:19.653 --> 10:21.121
Julia, come on. Let's go.

10:22.406 --> 10:24.082
Julia! Come on!

10:34.710 --> 10:36.229
<i>...to have a husband.</i>

10:36.253 --> 10:38.805
<i>If she'll fool her husband,
I figure she'll fool me.</i>

10:39.673 --> 10:42.360
<i>Now, New York is not as big a
city as it pretends to be,</i>

10:42.384 --> 10:44.436
<i>so I spent the next day...</i>

11:05.157 --> 11:06.750
Julia?

11:08.994 --> 11:10.879
I'm tired, okay?
I'm going to bed.

11:12.581 --> 11:14.049
I want to talk to you.

11:17.002 --> 11:20.388
So, um, how'd you get home?

11:21.006 --> 11:22.682
I got a ride.

11:23.258 --> 11:24.569
From who, someone
who was drinking?

11:24.593 --> 11:26.269
No.

11:26.470 --> 11:29.815
Look, Charlie, I don't want to fight with
you, okay, and I don't need a lecture.

11:30.224 --> 11:31.942
That's not what I'm doing.

11:33.227 --> 11:35.111
Look, I'm trying
not to get angry.

11:36.647 --> 11:38.240
I'm just a little freaked.

11:38.690 --> 11:40.867
Everyone there knew you, Jule.
Everyone.

11:41.068 --> 11:42.911
- They knew what you drank.
- So?

11:43.403 --> 11:45.924
You don't have to overreact.
It's not like I'm living there.

11:45.948 --> 11:48.416
You know what I mean.
You're underaged.

11:48.742 --> 11:50.752
What did you do? Get a
fake ID or something?

11:50.953 --> 11:55.131
Yeah, at that passport place on
Market Street, where you got yours.

11:57.918 --> 11:59.886
You could get in trouble, Jule.

12:01.547 --> 12:04.150
Going to clubs, running
around with a fake ID,

12:04.174 --> 12:05.401
you could get us in trouble.

12:05.425 --> 12:08.186
Yeah? Who's going to find out?

12:09.638 --> 12:11.940
I don't know. Mr. Graham.

12:11.974 --> 12:14.442
Mr. Graham? Come on.

12:14.893 --> 12:18.363
Something tells me most estate executors
aren't too into the club scene.

12:19.231 --> 12:20.750
He could find out.

12:20.774 --> 12:23.419
Just like he could find
out you blew that money.

12:23.443 --> 12:25.287
That 12,000 bucks.

12:25.821 --> 12:28.707
He'd be upset about that
too, wouldn't he, Charlie?

12:37.916 --> 12:39.134
It's Claudia.

12:39.668 --> 12:41.062
I need my hairbrush.

12:41.086 --> 12:42.605
Okay. Just make it fast.

12:42.629 --> 12:44.482
You've been in here for hours.
What are you doing?

12:44.506 --> 12:45.984
What does it look
like I'm doing?

12:46.008 --> 12:49.644
Well, you're certainly not staring at
the sun without protective glasses.

12:49.678 --> 12:50.937
No.

12:51.805 --> 12:53.231
I don't know.

12:54.516 --> 12:58.037
Maybe it's just a
cosmic phase I'm in,

12:58.061 --> 12:59.956
but the way your head's
blocking the sun,

12:59.980 --> 13:03.241
it kind of makes your hair look
like the color of burned umbra.

13:04.109 --> 13:05.753
Claud, are you in some
kind of play or something?

13:05.777 --> 13:06.879
Bailey, you...

13:06.903 --> 13:08.256
Oh, can you do me a favor?

13:08.280 --> 13:11.092
When Kate calls, tell her we're
meeting at the Clement at 3:00.

13:11.116 --> 13:12.635
Think you can remember that?

13:12.659 --> 13:15.179
The Clement. At 3:00?

13:15.203 --> 13:16.421
Yeah.

13:18.415 --> 13:19.716
Got it.

13:20.792 --> 13:22.103
You always eat breakfast.

13:22.127 --> 13:24.429
Don't you want anything at all?

13:26.965 --> 13:28.484
I wasn't sure you'd show up.

13:28.508 --> 13:30.894
I have a job to do.
Busy still the same.

13:31.219 --> 13:32.238
Listen, can we talk?

13:32.262 --> 13:34.324
I really don't want to hear any
more of your stories, Charlie.

13:34.348 --> 13:36.399
Look. No more stories.

13:41.355 --> 13:43.365
I did sleep with her,

13:44.107 --> 13:46.952
with Rebecca, in my truck
that night, one night.

13:48.820 --> 13:50.330
You were right, okay?

13:50.614 --> 13:51.549
Okay.

13:51.573 --> 13:52.592
That's not what I meant.

13:52.616 --> 13:54.250
Just go away. God!

13:58.997 --> 14:03.061
What I meant to say is that I
am really, really sorry, and...

14:03.085 --> 14:04.145
What's the matter, sweetheart?

14:04.169 --> 14:05.647
Would you leave him
be for a minute?

14:05.671 --> 14:07.347
No!

14:09.758 --> 14:13.561
Look, I've been trying to figure out why
I did such an incredibly stupid thing.

14:13.720 --> 14:16.949
Maybe it's because things
were starting to, you know,

14:16.973 --> 14:19.234
kind of get intense with us.

14:19.601 --> 14:21.653
I got scared, maybe, you know?

14:22.646 --> 14:23.957
See, I do that to myself.

14:23.981 --> 14:26.574
I sabotage things, good things.

14:27.776 --> 14:31.714
So, in, in a weird way,
if I cheated on you,

14:31.738 --> 14:33.383
it wasn't because things
were bad between us,

14:33.407 --> 14:34.884
because they were so great!

14:34.908 --> 14:36.710
This is an apology?

14:37.536 --> 14:40.338
I... I can't take
back my mistake.

14:40.622 --> 14:42.892
It's over with Rebecca, and actually
it wasn't really anything at all.

14:42.916 --> 14:44.894
It was just one time,

14:44.918 --> 14:48.305
and since then, I've
wanted to be with you.

14:48.463 --> 14:51.057
I mean, I've only
wanted to be with you.

14:51.717 --> 14:54.112
I mean, I even asked
you to stay the night.

14:54.136 --> 14:56.271
That is a big step for me.

14:57.973 --> 15:00.233
- That's got to mean something.
- Yeah.

15:00.976 --> 15:04.247
I think it means you haven't found any women
to screw around with in the past two weeks.

15:04.271 --> 15:05.331
No.

15:05.355 --> 15:06.958
Would you just wait a minute?

15:06.982 --> 15:08.710
This isn't about us, Charlie,

15:08.734 --> 15:10.285
or about Rebecca.

15:10.736 --> 15:13.673
It's about you and what
kind of guy you are.

15:13.697 --> 15:16.291
Right! That's what I'm saying!
My mistake.

15:17.200 --> 15:19.586
But don't I get a
chance to change?

15:19.953 --> 15:22.223
You really do think like a kid.

15:22.247 --> 15:24.726
You make a mistake,
you say I'm sorry,

15:24.750 --> 15:27.135
and then it's a clean
slate every time, right?

15:27.627 --> 15:30.013
What is it, then? One strike,
and I'm out with you?

15:31.214 --> 15:32.557
I guess so.

15:33.133 --> 15:34.309
Yeah.

15:35.969 --> 15:39.866
Because that's what happens when you
cheat on me, and when you lie to me,

15:39.890 --> 15:41.858
while you make me fall
in love with you.

15:43.310 --> 15:45.195
I really wish you
hadn't done that.

16:05.874 --> 16:06.809
Hey!

16:06.833 --> 16:09.520
What did you think you were doing
sending Kate to the wrong theater?

16:09.544 --> 16:11.564
Gee, did I do that?

16:11.588 --> 16:13.858
Cut the crap, Claud.
You did it on purpose.

16:13.882 --> 16:16.569
Maybe. Or maybe I just forgot.

16:16.593 --> 16:19.072
You of all people should know how
easy it is to forget things.

16:19.096 --> 16:20.364
What is that supposed to mean?

16:20.388 --> 16:21.657
If you thought about something

16:21.681 --> 16:23.117
other than what's-her-name
for 30 seconds,

16:23.141 --> 16:24.202
maybe you'd figure it out!

16:24.226 --> 16:25.870
Kate. Her name is Kate,

16:25.894 --> 16:28.372
and she waited outside the movie
theater for an hour and a half!

16:28.396 --> 16:30.124
So? I waited. So can she!

16:30.148 --> 16:31.584
What are you talking about?
Waited for what?

16:31.608 --> 16:33.284
For you, you moron!

16:34.402 --> 16:36.371
Yesterday. The eclipse.

16:37.114 --> 16:39.759
And if you're thinking of making
it up to me, forget it. You can't.

16:39.783 --> 16:42.428
This kind of eclipse won't
happen again till 2020.

16:42.452 --> 16:43.387
I'll be 37!

16:43.411 --> 16:45.765
I'm sorry, Claud, but you
could have reminded me.

16:45.789 --> 16:47.100
I shouldn't have to.

16:47.124 --> 16:48.851
You should remember
about it by yourself.

16:48.875 --> 16:51.229
You used to remember everything
before what's-her-name.

16:51.253 --> 16:52.313
Kate!

16:52.337 --> 16:54.315
Kate, Kate, Kate!
Kate, Kate, Kate!

16:54.339 --> 16:56.150
You know, Kate's a
really stupid name.

16:56.174 --> 16:57.892
Yeah, well, get used to it!

16:59.427 --> 17:00.728
Okay, look.

17:01.012 --> 17:02.949
This obviously isn't about
me missing the eclipse.

17:02.973 --> 17:04.951
This is about the fact
that I have a girlfriend.

17:04.974 --> 17:07.109
So you have a girlfriend.

17:07.269 --> 17:08.246
Big whoop.

17:08.270 --> 17:11.999
Yeah, and I'm going to spend as much time with
her as I can, Claud, whether you like it or not.

17:12.022 --> 17:13.291
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

17:13.316 --> 17:15.627
So why don't you stop acting
like such a little baby?

17:15.652 --> 17:17.505
Hey, guys, we've got to talk.
Where's Julia?

17:17.529 --> 17:18.548
I have no idea.

17:18.571 --> 17:19.789
Julia!

17:20.031 --> 17:21.624
- Look...
- What's going on now?

17:21.867 --> 17:23.376
We'll take care of it.

17:23.492 --> 17:25.429
If this is another lecture...

17:25.453 --> 17:26.556
Make it fast, Charlie.

17:26.579 --> 17:27.848
Yeah, you'd better
hurry up, Charlie,

17:27.873 --> 17:29.475
before Bailey has to go
out on another date.

17:29.499 --> 17:30.925
- Claudia...
- Listen!

17:32.669 --> 17:34.262
Things aren't working
out for Kirsten.

17:34.921 --> 17:37.807
Personal stuff, and, uh...
she's going to be leaving us.

17:38.008 --> 17:39.277
- What are you talking about?
- She can't!

17:39.301 --> 17:40.477
What kind of personal stuff?

17:40.510 --> 17:41.946
It's personal.

17:41.970 --> 17:43.447
Well, does she want a raise?

17:43.471 --> 17:44.448
Are her hours too long?

17:44.472 --> 17:45.616
What did you do
this time, Charlie?

17:45.640 --> 17:48.077
Hey, why do you automatically
assume it was something I did?

17:48.101 --> 17:49.453
Right. Sorry.

17:49.477 --> 17:52.197
Could it possibly have been
something that you did, Charlie?

17:53.398 --> 17:55.074
We're just having...

17:55.150 --> 17:56.743
relationship problems.

17:58.028 --> 17:59.162
You cheated on her.

17:59.696 --> 18:01.414
God, I knew you would do that!

18:01.907 --> 18:04.385
Just go for the girl and the hell
with everyone else, right, Charlie?

18:04.409 --> 18:05.344
You should talk!

18:05.368 --> 18:06.596
Oh, give me a break, Claudia.

18:06.620 --> 18:07.879
Look, we'll fix this!

18:08.747 --> 18:11.674
Kirsten's not leaving immediately.
We just need to start looking.

18:11.750 --> 18:12.810
What? You're not going to help?

18:12.834 --> 18:16.095
I dare you to give me one more lecture
on personal responsibility ever.

18:20.884 --> 18:21.861
Let's just...

18:21.885 --> 18:23.237
Talk about what
we're going to do.

18:23.261 --> 18:24.906
You know what, Charlie?
She's right.

18:24.930 --> 18:26.657
I found Kirsten, and
you screwed it up,

18:26.681 --> 18:28.993
so why don't you take care
of things for a change?

18:29.017 --> 18:30.401
I'm getting a life.

18:32.312 --> 18:33.289
Where are you going?

18:33.313 --> 18:34.531
Give it a rest, Claud.

18:35.023 --> 18:37.376
We're supposed to
have dinner together

18:37.400 --> 18:38.743
as a whole family.

18:39.069 --> 18:41.788
Yeah? Well, I'm a little sick
of the whole family right now.

18:52.165 --> 18:53.591
I'm sorry.

18:55.043 --> 18:56.511
I'll fix this.

18:57.254 --> 18:59.180
I know Kirsten was great.

19:00.674 --> 19:02.225
I'm sorry.

19:03.551 --> 19:05.144
I think...

19:06.638 --> 19:08.982
I think I'm going
to go call Ross.

19:10.267 --> 19:11.734
Maybe he's free.

19:13.103 --> 19:15.113
I can take you to dinner.

19:18.024 --> 19:20.535
I don't know why
you do this stuff,

19:22.153 --> 19:24.414
but I wish you'd just stop.

19:34.708 --> 19:36.801
It's okay, it's okay.

19:41.631 --> 19:43.516
It's okay, it's okay.

19:44.301 --> 19:46.436
Poor sweetie. You're burning up.

19:47.387 --> 19:49.573
We're going to give
you a nice warm bath.

19:49.597 --> 19:51.816
Would that make you feel better?

19:52.309 --> 19:54.402
That'll make you
feel so much better.

19:56.021 --> 19:57.697
Oh, God.

19:57.814 --> 19:59.449
Okay. Okay.

19:59.983 --> 20:02.201
Come on.

20:02.861 --> 20:04.704
Yeah. Come on.

20:05.947 --> 20:07.582
Bailey?

20:08.199 --> 20:09.459
Julia?

20:09.868 --> 20:11.095
Hello?

20:11.119 --> 20:13.713
Yeah. I just took his
temp, and it's 105.

20:15.540 --> 20:17.175
No, he hasn't been eating.

20:18.418 --> 20:22.189
Yes, extremely irritable. And now he's...
Uh-huh, very lethargic.

20:22.213 --> 20:23.890
Does that sound bad?

20:25.175 --> 20:26.434
Okay.

20:27.260 --> 20:28.811
Okay.

20:29.763 --> 20:32.398
All right. I'll meet you at the hospital.
Thank you.

20:37.562 --> 20:39.457
<i>Dr. Walden to Oncology.</i>

20:39.481 --> 20:41.407
<i>Dr. Walden to Oncology, please.</i>

20:44.152 --> 20:45.703
Charlie!

20:47.280 --> 20:48.257
You got my note.

20:48.281 --> 20:49.300
Yeah, of course. Where's Owen?

20:49.324 --> 20:50.718
- They're examining him.
- What happened?

20:50.742 --> 20:52.386
I don't know. He was hot and...

20:52.410 --> 20:54.055
They just took him
in five minutes ago.

20:54.079 --> 20:55.473
Okay. Okay.

20:55.497 --> 20:56.714
Are you okay?

20:57.874 --> 20:59.226
Thanks for doing this.

20:59.250 --> 21:00.311
What? Of course.

21:00.335 --> 21:01.562
Salinger.

21:01.586 --> 21:04.472
<i>Dr. Bergen. ICU. Stat.</i>

21:04.964 --> 21:05.858
Are you the father?

21:05.882 --> 21:08.059
Yes. I mean, no.
I'm his guardian.

21:08.426 --> 21:11.447
Okay. I need you to fill out
all these admission forms

21:11.471 --> 21:13.731
along with a brief
medical history.

21:13.890 --> 21:15.942
Has Owen had all
his immunizations?

21:16.518 --> 21:18.361
Yes. He's up to date.

21:18.520 --> 21:19.705
Any known allergies?

21:19.729 --> 21:21.207
No drug reactions
that I know of,

21:21.231 --> 21:23.241
but he does have
some food allergies.

21:23.274 --> 21:25.618
Okay. Could you fill out
these forms, for me, please?

21:29.114 --> 21:31.290
Maybe you should
call the others.

21:37.205 --> 21:39.549
Hello? Hey.

21:41.126 --> 21:42.436
Just out driving.

21:42.460 --> 21:44.637
I needed to get away from
everyone for a while.

21:46.214 --> 21:47.525
No, it's not okay.

21:47.549 --> 21:50.017
She can be a miserable
little creep sometimes.

21:51.678 --> 21:53.312
Forget it?

21:53.680 --> 21:55.574
We are not all doing
anything together.

21:55.598 --> 21:57.900
She's got friends. Let her
bug them for a change.

21:58.476 --> 22:01.571
I get to go out with you alone.
It's not a family thing.

22:02.772 --> 22:05.825
Hang on a second. I got another call.
I'll be right back.

22:06.192 --> 22:07.410
Hello?

22:07.861 --> 22:10.913
Remember, you can have
anything you want.

22:13.366 --> 22:14.792
We're comp'd.

22:15.577 --> 22:16.846
Well, what's good?

22:16.870 --> 22:18.087
Everything.

22:18.329 --> 22:19.348
Manicotti?

22:19.372 --> 22:20.641
Yuck.

22:20.665 --> 22:22.935
Okay. Everything
except the manicotti.

22:22.959 --> 22:25.052
Hey, Claudia. Where's
the rest of the gang?

22:25.336 --> 22:27.815
Oh, it's just us two. You
can clear the other places.

22:27.839 --> 22:29.265
Okay.

22:31.009 --> 22:33.320
You know,

22:33.344 --> 22:37.607
it's really nice not having a big,
loud crowded dinner for once.

22:38.099 --> 22:42.403
When you think about it, a
family dinner every week?

22:42.937 --> 22:44.530
It's pretty lame.

22:44.606 --> 22:46.532
Well, you always
said you loved it.

22:46.649 --> 22:48.627
I was just humoring the others.

22:48.651 --> 22:49.879
Oh. Okay.

22:49.903 --> 22:52.038
I mean, it's a big deal to them.

22:52.614 --> 22:54.290
Forget about them tonight.

22:54.449 --> 22:56.334
Tonight we'll just talk
about whatever you want.

22:56.576 --> 22:57.752
Okay.

22:59.245 --> 23:00.922
It would be a nice change.

23:01.372 --> 23:03.674
Everyone is so
messed up right now.

23:04.083 --> 23:06.385
- Are they?
- In a big way.

23:06.794 --> 23:08.638
And I finally figured out why.

23:10.590 --> 23:11.807
Sex.

23:12.467 --> 23:13.527
Excuse me?

23:13.551 --> 23:15.154
Think about it.

23:15.178 --> 23:17.615
Why can't Bailey
stay away from Kate?

23:17.639 --> 23:18.699
Sex.

23:18.723 --> 23:21.609
Why is Kirsten mad at Charlie?
Sex.

23:21.935 --> 23:23.236
Why is Julia acting so weird?

23:24.020 --> 23:25.154
Sex?

23:25.230 --> 23:26.906
Well, not yet.

23:27.106 --> 23:28.366
But give her time.

23:29.275 --> 23:31.202
Don't ever have sex, Ross.

23:31.361 --> 23:33.120
It really messes people up.

23:34.030 --> 23:35.373
Thanks for the tip.

23:35.949 --> 23:38.052
Claudia? Charlie's on the phone.

23:38.076 --> 23:40.086
He says he needs to talk to you.

23:41.079 --> 23:42.505
Tell him I'm busy.

23:43.081 --> 23:45.017
He said it was an emergency.

23:45.041 --> 23:46.259
It's about Owen.

23:50.380 --> 23:52.191
Hey. What's going on? How is he?

23:52.215 --> 23:54.360
Don't know yet. Doctor came
out a little while ago

23:54.384 --> 23:55.986
and she said that he
still had a fever.

23:56.010 --> 23:57.655
They think it might
be meningitis.

23:57.679 --> 23:59.907
- But they're not sure?
- They're running some tests,

23:59.931 --> 24:02.608
blood, urine, something
called a gram stain.

24:03.518 --> 24:05.611
Meningitis. What is that?
Is that dangerous?

24:05.645 --> 24:08.864
She said it could be. Said something
about deafness, seizures.

24:08.940 --> 24:10.324
What are the chances of that?

24:10.692 --> 24:12.294
I'm not sure.

24:12.318 --> 24:14.328
Charlie, didn't you
ask anybody anything?

24:14.487 --> 24:16.840
Next time, be here when
the doctor's here, okay?

24:16.864 --> 24:18.008
Mr. Salinger.

24:18.032 --> 24:19.750
Right here. Yeah?

24:20.618 --> 24:22.012
How is he?

24:22.036 --> 24:23.389
This is my brother.

24:23.413 --> 24:24.765
There's no change.

24:24.789 --> 24:26.392
In order to rule out meningitis,

24:26.416 --> 24:29.186
we'd like your permission to
admit him to the hospital

24:29.210 --> 24:32.054
and do a lumbar
puncture, a spinal tap.

24:33.214 --> 24:34.348
Is that dangerous?

24:34.632 --> 24:38.195
Well, generally, no. There's a remote
chance of some bleeding or an infection

24:38.219 --> 24:40.605
or, in the rarest cases,
neurological impairment.

24:43.891 --> 24:45.651
Maybe we should get
a second opinion.

24:46.436 --> 24:48.654
Our regular doctor's
out of town.

24:49.314 --> 24:52.074
Look, if it were my
child, I'd do it.

24:58.072 --> 24:59.049
Do it.

24:59.073 --> 25:00.416
Do the test.

25:01.200 --> 25:04.378
Good. And we'll know by morning.
Okay.

25:07.373 --> 25:08.976
Where's Claudia?

25:09.000 --> 25:10.561
Uh, Ross is bringing her.

25:10.585 --> 25:12.136
What about Julia?

25:14.339 --> 25:15.441
I don't have a
clue where she is.

25:15.465 --> 25:17.391
Is she working at that
burger place tonight?

25:20.094 --> 25:21.270
I'll find her.

25:26.267 --> 25:28.611
Uh, she's kind of
busy right now.

25:29.854 --> 25:31.447
He says it's important.

25:31.773 --> 25:33.792
Look, I know what you think
and you know what I think,

25:33.816 --> 25:35.826
so why don't you leave
me the hell alone?

25:46.788 --> 25:50.091
So we should probably go to Admissions
first. They'll tell us where he is.

25:50.958 --> 25:52.718
I'll probably stay here.

25:53.086 --> 25:54.595
What?

25:55.129 --> 25:56.806
In the car.

25:57.799 --> 25:59.975
You go in without me.

26:00.718 --> 26:03.020
I'm not going to leave you here.

26:04.013 --> 26:05.606
Please.

26:11.479 --> 26:12.947
Oh, Claudia.

26:15.024 --> 26:18.035
Is this where they brought
your parents when they...

26:20.822 --> 26:22.707
I can't go in there.

26:24.075 --> 26:25.677
Let go of me! Charlie, stop it!

26:25.701 --> 26:27.221
- It's Owen!
- What happened?

26:27.245 --> 26:28.764
He's in the hospital.
Come on, get in!

26:28.788 --> 26:30.307
- Was there an accident?
- No.

26:30.331 --> 26:32.258
What happened, Charlie?
Is he sick?

26:32.375 --> 26:34.802
Did he swallow something? He's
always putting things in his mouth.

26:35.294 --> 26:36.730
Come on, Charlie, talk to me!

26:36.754 --> 26:38.514
They think he might
have meningitis.

26:39.215 --> 26:40.401
Oh, my God. Is he
going to be okay?

26:40.425 --> 26:41.652
How the hell should I know?

26:41.676 --> 26:44.738
If I was at the hospital
instead of looking for you...

26:44.762 --> 26:47.324
- What?
- Damn it! Now we're stuck!

26:47.348 --> 26:48.826
What are you doing down
here in the first place?

26:48.850 --> 26:50.202
I called you! I said
it was important!

26:50.226 --> 26:52.287
I didn't know. I thought you
were calling me to yell at me.

26:52.311 --> 26:54.289
You'd just better hope there aren't
any problems at the hospital

26:54.313 --> 26:55.990
I should be dealing
with right now.

27:09.954 --> 27:11.422
What's going on, Claud?

27:11.581 --> 27:12.474
How is he?

27:12.498 --> 27:14.184
We don't know yet.
We're waiting to hear.

27:14.208 --> 27:15.426
Come inside.

27:15.501 --> 27:17.229
I'm just going to sit out here.

27:17.253 --> 27:18.471
All night?

27:18.838 --> 27:20.639
Come on. It's getting cold.

27:20.798 --> 27:23.017
- I don't mind.
- You don't mind?

27:24.260 --> 27:26.655
Look, I got to get back
inside, so I can't...

27:26.679 --> 27:27.813
Fine.

27:27.889 --> 27:29.023
So don't.

27:32.643 --> 27:34.820
I'd rather be alone anyway.

27:41.819 --> 27:42.963
I'm sorry about this.

27:42.987 --> 27:45.664
Oh, don't worry about it. Um...

27:47.158 --> 27:49.001
It's hard for her.

27:49.160 --> 27:51.388
Look, uh, could you
just take her home?

27:51.412 --> 27:52.723
Do you mind?

27:52.747 --> 27:54.266
- Of course, yeah.
- Okay.

27:54.290 --> 27:56.560
Could you stay with her
till one of us gets home?

27:56.584 --> 27:57.561
Yeah, sure. No problem.

27:57.585 --> 27:58.969
Okay. Thanks.

28:11.516 --> 28:13.067
Any good tips?

28:13.643 --> 28:15.204
What?

28:15.228 --> 28:16.622
Oh.

28:16.646 --> 28:18.081
I wasn't really...

28:18.105 --> 28:19.698
Thanks.

28:23.110 --> 28:27.414
I was just thinking,
he was born here.

28:32.286 --> 28:36.465
A couple years ago, I was sharing
this place in Potrero with some guys.

28:37.583 --> 28:39.510
Mom came to see me.

28:40.711 --> 28:44.640
I'd just dropped out of school, so I figured
she came by to give me a hard time.

28:46.050 --> 28:47.726
She didn't.

28:48.636 --> 28:50.447
She said,

28:50.471 --> 28:53.399
"You'll never guess, Charlie,
not in a million years."

28:55.101 --> 28:56.569
She was pregnant.

28:57.228 --> 28:58.863
On purpose?

29:00.398 --> 29:02.251
Are you kidding?

29:02.275 --> 29:03.826
She was 44.

29:05.862 --> 29:07.923
And at first I thought,

29:07.947 --> 29:11.760
jeez, after all these years,
they're still, you know,

29:11.784 --> 29:13.002
getting it on.

29:14.287 --> 29:17.631
It's kind of nice to know that
about your folks, isn't it?

29:18.916 --> 29:20.384
Then I thought,

29:21.335 --> 29:23.605
why did they want to go
through it all again?

29:23.629 --> 29:29.185
I mean, the diapers and
teething and sleepless nights.

29:30.803 --> 29:32.563
But she did.

29:32.930 --> 29:34.565
They did.

29:37.018 --> 29:39.580
She was wearing this

29:39.604 --> 29:41.614
green dress that day.

29:42.773 --> 29:45.576
Standing in that crummy hallway.

29:47.570 --> 29:51.790
She just looked so happy.

30:07.548 --> 30:08.849
Hey.

30:11.886 --> 30:14.438
I didn't know he had a fever.

30:16.599 --> 30:19.276
I mean, I wouldn't have left if
I'd known something was wrong.

30:19.393 --> 30:21.278
I know that, Jule.

30:28.611 --> 30:30.454
Hospitals, huh?

30:31.364 --> 30:32.998
The worst.

30:34.700 --> 30:37.461
You think it's always gonna
be like this for us?

30:38.371 --> 30:40.172
I don't know.

30:40.998 --> 30:43.342
Maybe these are the
good old days.

30:44.543 --> 30:47.638
Yeah, it just doesn't get much
better than this, does it?

30:48.339 --> 30:50.349
It's all downhill from here.

31:00.226 --> 31:02.569
I was thinking
maybe I should go.

31:03.062 --> 31:04.706
Really?

31:04.730 --> 31:08.033
I mean, uh, sure.

31:08.776 --> 31:10.953
I guess if... If you want to.

31:14.031 --> 31:18.210
I'm just not sure it's right
for me to be here, you know?

31:19.412 --> 31:22.840
It's not like I'm a member of
the family or anything, so...

31:26.210 --> 31:28.563
It helps having you here.

31:28.587 --> 31:31.140
I mean it. I want you to stay.

31:33.551 --> 31:36.228
You know... Don't go, please.

31:36.637 --> 31:38.230
Okay.

31:50.359 --> 31:53.120
Scary seeing him with
that thing in his arm.

32:00.244 --> 32:02.921
I didn't deserve those
things you said to me.

32:03.664 --> 32:06.550
Just because I was at some
club when Owen got sick.

32:08.794 --> 32:11.138
If I'd known, you honestly
think I'd have been there?

32:12.298 --> 32:14.308
I don't know, Julia.

32:14.592 --> 32:16.685
It's hard to know what you
care about these days.

32:16.761 --> 32:18.238
Why? Because I went to a club?

32:18.262 --> 32:20.699
Because I told you not
to, and you went anyway.

32:20.723 --> 32:23.567
Like you never had a drop to
drink before you were 18.

32:23.809 --> 32:25.579
Like you never
disobeyed Mom and Dad.

32:25.603 --> 32:26.621
This is different.

32:26.645 --> 32:27.664
How is it different?

32:27.688 --> 32:28.915
You know.

32:28.939 --> 32:30.699
No, I don't. Tell me.

32:30.775 --> 32:32.826
It's different because
they're dead, Julia.

32:34.195 --> 32:36.872
You think I want to
be in this position?

32:37.073 --> 32:40.084
You think I don't know I sound like a
damn hypocrite telling you what to do?

32:41.410 --> 32:43.462
What choice do I have?
Someone's gotta.

32:47.958 --> 32:49.936
You could make things so much
easier on me, but you won't.

32:49.960 --> 32:52.304
Instead, you've got to fight
me every step of the way.

32:54.215 --> 32:55.682
I just don't get you.

32:56.592 --> 32:58.268
I don't know what
matters to you anymore.

32:58.511 --> 33:00.145
How can you say that?

33:01.013 --> 33:03.315
I'm the same person
I always was.

33:04.016 --> 33:06.360
I still care about
the same things.

33:06.685 --> 33:08.612
- Do you?
- Yes.

33:11.816 --> 33:13.659
Yes.

33:44.265 --> 33:45.774
Knock, knock.

33:52.940 --> 33:55.033
What are you doing here?

33:55.776 --> 33:58.495
Owen's asleep. Tests
aren't back yet.

33:59.530 --> 34:01.999
And I wanted to see
how you're doing.

34:02.950 --> 34:04.877
Is this Owen or me?

34:09.373 --> 34:12.092
I think that's you.
He had more hair.

34:14.670 --> 34:17.097
- Claudia...
- Do you believe in omens?

34:17.797 --> 34:19.317
What do you mean?

34:19.341 --> 34:21.476
Signs that bad things
are going to happen.

34:24.013 --> 34:26.106
No. I don't.

34:26.806 --> 34:29.578
I think people need
to look for reasons

34:29.601 --> 34:31.737
that bad things happen,

34:32.646 --> 34:34.156
but sometimes there
just aren't any.

34:36.358 --> 34:37.993
Look...

34:38.735 --> 34:40.454
I know why you're here.

34:41.614 --> 34:43.290
You think I should
go to the hospital.

34:43.532 --> 34:44.426
No, it's not...

34:44.449 --> 34:46.083
But I'm not going to.

34:51.331 --> 34:52.591
I can't.

34:53.250 --> 34:54.967
Yeah. I know.

34:56.003 --> 34:58.398
I know what you're remembering, Claud.
We all are.

34:58.422 --> 35:01.193
But you think it's bad that
I'm not going, don't you?

35:01.217 --> 35:02.434
No.

35:02.468 --> 35:04.446
I mean, Owen is sick, and I...

35:04.470 --> 35:06.438
Claudia, I think it's okay.

35:07.014 --> 35:08.440
Really.

35:08.641 --> 35:09.942
You don't have to go.

35:12.186 --> 35:13.403
You mean that?

35:15.606 --> 35:17.709
It's okay. Don't feel bad.

35:17.733 --> 35:21.745
Everyone understands, and
Owen knows that you love him.

35:26.325 --> 35:28.252
You probably have
to get back, huh?

35:28.369 --> 35:29.930
No, I got a few minutes.

35:29.954 --> 35:32.631
You can go. Don't
worry about me.

35:32.998 --> 35:34.841
Come on. I do.

35:35.417 --> 35:37.052
I worry about you.

35:38.545 --> 35:39.805
And...

35:40.005 --> 35:42.651
I know that I haven't been too
great about it the last few weeks.

35:42.675 --> 35:44.226
It's okay.

35:45.302 --> 35:47.113
I just bug you, right?

35:47.137 --> 35:48.740
I mean, I'm kind of
just a big pain.

35:48.764 --> 35:51.191
No. You're not. I just...

35:53.811 --> 35:57.406
I'm just... I'm... I'm trying to
figure out how to work things, Claud.

35:57.481 --> 36:00.627
I mean, Kate's the first
girlfriend I've ever had,

36:00.651 --> 36:02.536
first real girlfriend.

36:02.736 --> 36:04.413
But I'm not
forgetting about you.

36:05.281 --> 36:07.624
I'm not. I promise.

36:07.741 --> 36:10.836
Whenever you need
me, you come first.

36:13.789 --> 36:15.299
Really?

36:25.509 --> 36:27.394
You're my sister.

36:45.988 --> 36:49.666
- It's pretty, the lights.
- Yeah.

36:57.499 --> 37:00.010
I heard about what
happened, Kirsten.

37:02.004 --> 37:04.222
What Charlie did.

37:05.257 --> 37:07.100
That's between the
two of us, Julia.

37:07.843 --> 37:09.478
I know.

37:09.636 --> 37:11.730
I know it's none of my business.

37:14.224 --> 37:16.443
I just wanted to ask if, uh...

37:19.146 --> 37:22.199
Well, if there's any way that
you could maybe forgive him?

37:24.193 --> 37:27.120
You see, some people, they
know the right things to do,

37:28.364 --> 37:31.875
and others, they have to figure it
out by doing the wrong things first.

37:33.243 --> 37:35.045
That's Charlie.

37:36.497 --> 37:38.090
Don't hate him for it.

37:40.000 --> 37:41.760
Last year, he was on his own,

37:42.211 --> 37:44.221
living his own life,

37:45.506 --> 37:47.724
and now he's got the four of us,

37:48.884 --> 37:50.686
and it hasn't been easy.

37:51.303 --> 37:53.156
He's trying.

37:53.180 --> 37:54.606
I know he is.

37:55.391 --> 37:56.942
But...

37:57.559 --> 37:59.361
But it still hurts.

38:02.147 --> 38:06.118
I swear to God, I wish I
knew how to get past this,

38:07.403 --> 38:09.329
but I don't.

38:10.531 --> 38:11.957
I can't.

38:14.284 --> 38:15.711
You're going to leave?

38:47.818 --> 38:49.035
Excuse me.

38:49.445 --> 38:50.912
Um, are those...

38:51.113 --> 38:53.707
- Is that from the lab?
- Yes.

38:53.949 --> 38:57.127
I'm waiting for test
results for Owen Salinger.

38:57.369 --> 38:59.347
Can you tell me,
are they in there?

38:59.371 --> 39:01.975
I'm sorry. I'm not permitted
to give out test results.

39:01.999 --> 39:03.842
Only a doctor can do that.

39:04.960 --> 39:07.053
You mean they're here, but you
just can't give them out to me.

39:07.212 --> 39:08.972
I'm afraid it's policy.

39:09.590 --> 39:11.099
Policy?

39:11.467 --> 39:14.529
Look, the doctor will
be in in a few hours,

39:14.553 --> 39:15.864
and as soon as she
gets settled...

39:15.888 --> 39:17.365
Look, you don't understand.

39:17.389 --> 39:20.400
A few hours isn't
good enough, okay?

39:21.185 --> 39:24.362
I'm his brother. I'm
responsible for him,

39:24.396 --> 39:27.333
and if he's in real trouble

39:27.357 --> 39:29.335
or if whatever he has could
have been prevented,

39:29.359 --> 39:31.828
I... I just...

39:32.446 --> 39:36.041
I need to know, okay,
because it's up to me.

39:36.658 --> 39:40.504
I mean, his being
okay is up to me.

39:40.913 --> 39:43.475
And I know your job...
You have your job to do.

39:43.499 --> 39:44.726
I know that's real important.

39:44.750 --> 39:46.853
I understand that, but I just
don't think it's more important

39:46.877 --> 39:48.970
than me knowing if
my brother's okay.

39:50.839 --> 39:53.475
You know how to read a
test result, right?

39:53.509 --> 39:55.811
I mean, you know
what that means.

39:59.097 --> 40:00.315
Salinger?

40:00.432 --> 40:02.192
Yeah. Owen.

40:10.192 --> 40:12.118
The culture came back negative.

40:13.362 --> 40:14.913
Which means...

40:16.490 --> 40:18.416
Which means he'll be fine.

40:25.832 --> 40:28.561
Doctor said we did the right
thing bringing him in.

40:28.585 --> 40:30.178
Keep getting the machine.

40:30.504 --> 40:32.722
Really? That's weird.

40:32.839 --> 40:33.733
Claudia.

40:33.757 --> 40:35.809
Pick up if you're there, Claud.

40:36.218 --> 40:38.061
Claudia.

40:38.845 --> 40:40.230
Owen's okay.

40:40.264 --> 40:42.951
They want to keep him
here for 48 hours,

40:42.975 --> 40:44.568
but he's going to be fine.

40:44.768 --> 40:46.027
He is?

40:52.609 --> 40:53.827
Really?

40:54.319 --> 40:55.547
Really.

40:55.571 --> 40:57.956
Gosh, that's...

40:58.115 --> 40:59.092
That's just...

40:59.116 --> 41:01.835
You know, Claud, you
didn't have to.

41:02.369 --> 41:03.712
I know.

41:04.580 --> 41:07.007
Well, you guys are just
in time for breakfast.

41:09.459 --> 41:11.386
Did you call Kate?

41:12.588 --> 41:14.482
You should.

41:14.506 --> 41:16.099
She's probably worried.

41:16.967 --> 41:20.863
Okay, we've got tuna, we got
turkey, we've got egg salad,

41:20.887 --> 41:23.481
we've got... Anyone's guess.

41:24.266 --> 41:25.660
Hey, you guys.

41:25.684 --> 41:27.287
Anyone for coffee? Ross?

41:27.311 --> 41:29.404
Sure, if you're getting some.

41:29.896 --> 41:31.457
Well, it sure ain't Salinger's.

41:31.481 --> 41:33.575
It'll do. Dibs on the tuna.

41:34.151 --> 41:35.577
What is that?

41:36.236 --> 41:40.081
A tofu burger. Kate's
very big on tofu.

41:43.285 --> 41:44.961
God knows why.

41:50.500 --> 41:52.385
- Hey.
- Hi.

41:54.212 --> 41:56.232
I won't leave you in
the lurch, Charlie.

41:56.256 --> 41:58.475
I'll stay until you
find someone else.

42:01.511 --> 42:03.438
I mean, for Owen.

42:07.809 --> 42:09.277
I'm sorry.

42:10.812 --> 42:13.073
God, I am. I'm so sorry.

42:14.441 --> 42:16.993
I wish I could take it all back.

42:17.819 --> 42:19.454
But...

42:19.863 --> 42:22.624
I can't. I know I can't.

42:25.535 --> 42:27.379
The thing is,

42:28.914 --> 42:30.558
I really do care
about you, Kirsten.

42:30.582 --> 42:31.726
I know you might
not believe that...

42:31.750 --> 42:34.803
No, I do.

42:38.715 --> 42:41.069
So we're going to have to work out
a schedule for the next few days

42:41.093 --> 42:42.862
until the doctor says
we can take him home.

42:42.886 --> 42:45.114
I'll take days if it means
I get out of English.

42:45.138 --> 42:46.481
I'll come by after school.

42:46.890 --> 42:48.910
Well, I can come back and
give you a dinner break.

42:48.934 --> 42:50.662
Actually, I'd kind of like
to be here in the evenings.

42:50.686 --> 42:52.080
Well, there's no reason
we can't overlap.

42:52.104 --> 42:53.998
Claudia, I can bring you by
first thing in the morning.

42:54.022 --> 42:55.240
Is that okay?

42:56.066 --> 42:58.284
Claudia?
