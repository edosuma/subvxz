01:55.933 --> 01:58.277
- What's new?
- Same old daily bunkeroo.

01:58.435 --> 02:02.485
Mr. Powers says he wants to see that
foreign stuff as soon as it comes in.

02:06.068 --> 02:08.446
Don't declare war
for a few minutes.

02:22.793 --> 02:25.387
"According to a high official,
it is believed..."

02:25.504 --> 02:26.881
Bah!

02:27.005 --> 02:29.224
Foreign correspondent!

02:29.341 --> 02:32.720
I could get more news out of Europe
looking in a crystal ball.

02:32.844 --> 02:35.814
That, uh, Stebbins cable
has a morsel in it.

02:35.973 --> 02:39.022
Stebbins makes me sick.
They all make me sick.

02:39.142 --> 02:42.988
Europe about to blow up, and all
I can get out of my foreign staff...

02:43.105 --> 02:45.028
is a daily guessing game.

02:45.148 --> 02:49.073
- I want some facts, Mr. Bradley!
- For instance?

02:49.194 --> 02:51.196
Any kind of facts.

02:51.321 --> 02:54.746
There must be something going on
in Europe beside a nervous breakdown.

02:54.866 --> 02:57.961
Why not try sending me over,
Mr. Powers?

02:59.705 --> 03:02.458
You've written a book
on economics or something...

03:02.583 --> 03:04.335
<i>The Twilight of Feudalism.</i>

03:04.459 --> 03:06.427
Yes. It was very
well received.

03:06.545 --> 03:08.718
Not by me. I don't want
any more economists...

03:08.839 --> 03:11.638
sages or oracles bombinating
over our cables.

03:11.758 --> 03:14.477
I want a reporter, somebody
who doesn't know the difference...

03:14.595 --> 03:16.268
between an "ism" and a kangaroo.

03:16.388 --> 03:19.642
A good, honest crime reporter...
that's what the <i>Globe</i> needs.

03:19.766 --> 03:21.359
That's what Europe needs.

03:21.476 --> 03:24.605
There's a crime hatching
on that bedeviled continent.

03:24.730 --> 03:26.983
Wait a minute.

03:27.107 --> 03:29.701
I've got something that
might pass for an idea.

03:31.737 --> 03:35.082
Who was that fellow that ran down
the payroll robbery last week?

03:35.198 --> 03:36.745
Oh, you mean Johnny Jones.

03:36.867 --> 03:39.495
He beat up a policeman,
didn't he, in the line of duty?

03:39.620 --> 03:42.123
Yes, there's talk at the
City desk of firing him.

03:42.247 --> 03:45.046
Hmm.
Beat up a policeman, eh?

03:46.126 --> 03:48.299
Sounds ideal for Europe.

03:50.047 --> 03:52.345
Send Mr. Jones up here
right away.

03:52.466 --> 03:55.390
Mr. Powers wants to see you,
Mr. Jones.

03:55.510 --> 03:58.138
- He does, huh?
- You should come right away.

03:58.263 --> 04:01.267
- What about?
- I ain't in his confidence.

04:01.391 --> 04:04.144
Tell him to save his breath.
Tell him I've resigned.

04:04.269 --> 04:07.068
- I'm supposed to bring you there.
- Okay.

04:07.189 --> 04:12.696
Wait till I open this.

04:12.819 --> 04:16.244
Where's Mr. Jones?
I told you to send him right up here!

04:21.870 --> 04:23.747
- Are you Mr. Jones?
- Yes.

04:23.914 --> 04:26.292
Sit down, please.

04:26.416 --> 04:28.919
Oh. You mind
a personal question?

04:29.086 --> 04:31.214
- No.
- Are you married?

04:31.338 --> 04:33.432
- No luck.
- Single, eh?

04:34.549 --> 04:36.426
- Ever been in Europe?
- No.

04:38.428 --> 04:41.352
What's your opinion of the present
European crisis, Mr. Jones?

04:41.473 --> 04:43.225
What crisis?

04:45.018 --> 04:47.567
I'm referring
to the impending war.

04:47.688 --> 04:48.539
Oh, that.

04:48.565 --> 04:51.968
To tell you the truth, Mr. Powers,
I haven't given it much thought.

04:52.109 --> 04:54.737
You don't keep up with our
foreign news, do you?

04:54.861 --> 04:58.240
Mr. Powers, if you're gonna fire me,
you can scrap the intelligence test.

04:58.365 --> 05:02.120
It's okay with me. I can get a job
on any other newspaper in town.

05:02.285 --> 05:03.537
- So long.
- Wait a minute.

05:03.662 --> 05:05.710
<i>- Nobody fired you.</i>
- Huh?

05:05.831 --> 05:08.926
How would you like to cover
the biggest story in the world today?

05:09.042 --> 05:11.302
Give me an expense account,
and I'll cover anything.

05:11.328 --> 05:12.947
I'll give you an
expense account.

05:13.046 --> 05:14.844
- Okay, what's the story?
- Europe.

05:14.965 --> 05:18.219
I'm not exactly equipped,
but I could do some reading up.

05:18.343 --> 05:20.562
No, I like you
just as you are.

05:20.679 --> 05:23.102
What Europe needs
is a fresh, unused mind.

05:23.223 --> 05:26.818
- Foreign correspondent, huh?
- No. Reporter.

05:28.311 --> 05:31.986
I don't want correspondence.
I want news.

05:32.107 --> 05:34.610
Think you could dig up
some news in Europe?

05:34.735 --> 05:37.739
- I'd be very happy to try, sir.
- This is what I mean.

05:37.863 --> 05:40.787
Mr. Van Meer, when questioned
by our oracle, Mr. Stebbins...

05:40.907 --> 05:42.830
refused to open his mouth.

05:42.993 --> 05:45.337
Twelve hundred words
cable-tolled to the fact that...

05:45.495 --> 05:47.668
the great Van Meer
had nothing to say.

05:47.831 --> 05:51.586
You know what that stuff is doing?
Driving our readers crazy with frustration.

05:51.710 --> 05:53.508
Who's Van Meer?

05:53.628 --> 05:55.505
Keynote to the European
situation today.

05:55.630 --> 05:58.008
Listen, Jones.
If Van Meer stays at the helm...

05:58.133 --> 06:00.431
of his country's affairs
for the next three months...

06:00.552 --> 06:02.350
it may mean peace in Europe.

06:02.512 --> 06:05.607
If we knew what he was thinking,
we'd know where Europe stands.

06:05.724 --> 06:07.897
- A German, huh?
- No. Holland's strongman.

06:08.018 --> 06:10.817
One of two signers
of the Dutch treaty with the Belgians.

06:10.937 --> 06:12.735
Now, this is
your first assignment.

06:12.856 --> 06:15.530
Talk with him,
find out what's in that treaty...

06:15.650 --> 06:17.948
and what he thinks
is going to happen... facts.

06:18.069 --> 06:19.912
- Van Meer, huh?
- Right.

06:20.030 --> 06:21.657
- Anybody else?
- No.

06:21.782 --> 06:22.667
How about Hitler?

06:22.693 --> 06:26.233
Don't you think it'd be good to pump him?
He must have something on his mind.

06:29.539 --> 06:30.183
Yes?

06:30.209 --> 06:32.784
<i>Mr. Stephen Fisher
to see you, Mr. Powers.</i>

06:32.876 --> 06:36.096
Tell him to come in.
Did you ever hear of Stephen Fisher?

06:36.213 --> 06:39.217
- I'm afraid he's not on my beat.
- He is from now on.

06:39.382 --> 06:42.226
He's head of the Universal Peace Party,
and very close to Van Meer.

06:42.344 --> 06:45.063
They're both working to prevent
Europe going up in flames.

06:45.180 --> 06:46.602
Oh.

06:46.723 --> 06:49.192
- How do you do, Mr. Fisher?
- How are you?

06:49.309 --> 06:51.903
- Nice of you to come over. Sit down.
- Thank you.

06:52.062 --> 06:54.781
Mr. Fisher, Mr. Jones,
our new foreign correspondent.

06:54.898 --> 06:57.902
- I want you to know each other.
- How do you do?

06:58.068 --> 06:59.695
"Jones"...
I don't like that name.

06:59.820 --> 07:02.039
It's going to handicap you,
young man.

07:02.155 --> 07:04.249
Now, wait a minute.

07:04.407 --> 07:06.580
I've got some sort
of a name here.

07:07.994 --> 07:10.588
Yes. "Haverstock."
"Huntley Haverstock."

07:10.705 --> 07:14.335
- Sounds more important, don't you think?
- Oh, yes. Very dashing too.

07:14.459 --> 07:16.435
It sounds better than
Richard Harding Davis.

07:16.461 --> 07:17.909
What's the matter with that?

07:18.004 --> 07:19.722
We can't use that.

07:19.840 --> 07:23.310
That's the name of one of our greatest
war correspondents 40 years ago.

07:23.426 --> 07:26.600
Speak up, young man. You don't mind
being Huntley Haverstock, do you?

07:26.721 --> 07:28.394
A rose by any name, sir.

07:28.515 --> 07:30.525
It's exciting being present
at the christening

07:30.551 --> 07:32.261
of an American newspaper
correspondent.

07:32.352 --> 07:34.446
Shouldn't we break a bottle
of champagne over him?

07:34.563 --> 07:39.285
Break one over my head to see if I'm
still awake. "Huntley Haverstock."

07:39.442 --> 07:41.444
Well, Mr. Haverstock,
you'd better get started.

07:41.611 --> 07:43.909
You've got a lot to do...
passports, photos, visas...

07:44.030 --> 07:46.283
- Expenses.
- I'll send a note to the cashier.

07:46.449 --> 07:48.451
I hope you brought
your Sunday articles over.

07:48.577 --> 07:50.625
I managed three of them.

07:50.745 --> 07:54.295
- See you in London, Mr. Haverstock.
- Yes, of course.

07:54.416 --> 07:56.714
Thank you, Mr. Powers.
Thank you for everything.

07:56.835 --> 07:59.304
Except Huntley Haverstock.

08:16.688 --> 08:18.986
Get a load of this, Mother.

08:19.149 --> 08:20.867
How's it look?
Chic?

08:20.984 --> 08:24.204
Don't wear it over one eye.
It makes you look like a gangster.

08:24.321 --> 08:28.497
You always think boys are wearing their hats
over one eye. Let him wear it the way it is.

08:28.617 --> 08:31.996
He'll have to wear a stovepipe when he
gets to London. They call 'em poppers.

08:32.120 --> 08:33.301
Toppers, Uncle Bjorn.

08:33.327 --> 08:36.025
Bobby, put that in the
box for Uncle John.

08:36.166 --> 08:38.965
- Let me try it on.
- No, I'm going to first.

08:39.085 --> 08:41.508
- Now he's a regular war correspondent.
- Without a war.

08:41.671 --> 08:43.135
He'll get his
war, all right.

08:43.160 --> 08:45.746
Aw, they're all throwing
a big bluff over there.

08:45.842 --> 08:47.185
Let's hope so.

08:47.302 --> 08:50.602
<i>Mother, how do you like
the way we have our nest furnished?</i>

08:50.722 --> 08:54.693
I'd hang lighter curtains, and I'd move
that sofa out in the middle.

08:54.809 --> 08:56.982
It's too bad you haven't
an open fireplace.

08:57.103 --> 08:59.777
If you'd speak to the captain,
he'd tend to everything.

09:01.101 --> 09:03.553
<i>All ashore that's going ashore!</i>

09:04.527 --> 09:06.780
<i>All ashore...</i>

09:06.905 --> 09:08.657
Now, Mother.

09:45.026 --> 09:48.030
You're Jones, aren't you? My name's
Stebbins, London man for the <i>Globe.</i>

09:48.154 --> 09:51.624
Yes, Mr. Powers told me
you'd be here. Nice of you to come.

09:51.741 --> 09:55.166
- I lost mine on the way over.
- I can say your other name too...

09:55.286 --> 09:57.334
that Huntley Tavers... feld...

09:57.455 --> 10:01.585
I could say it yesterday, but I had a
tough session with the boys last night.

10:01.710 --> 10:04.964
- I'll stick to Jones, if you don't mind.
- Jones is great with me.

10:05.088 --> 10:07.341
Let's get out of here.
This crowd's making me nervous.

10:07.465 --> 10:09.467
My nerves aren't
in the pink this morning.

10:09.592 --> 10:11.594
You take it easy.
I'll follow you.

10:11.720 --> 10:14.522
Porter, bring those bags, and
don't bang them into my knees.

10:14.548 --> 10:15.466
Very good, sir.

10:18.685 --> 10:21.108
What about a drink
after that long train ride?

10:21.271 --> 10:23.114
Sounds like
a very logical idea.

10:23.273 --> 10:26.026
I may not act it,
but I've been here 25 years...

10:26.151 --> 10:29.451
London man for the <i>Globe,</i>
and they haven't caught on to me yet.

10:29.571 --> 10:30.583
How did you manage it?

10:30.609 --> 10:32.770
You cable back the
government handouts...

10:32.866 --> 10:35.085
and sign 'em
"our London correspondent."

10:35.201 --> 10:37.078
- What's yours?
- Scotch and soda, please.

10:37.203 --> 10:39.626
- Miss? Oh, miss?
- Just a moment, sir.

10:41.624 --> 10:43.797
Oh, miss, please...

10:43.918 --> 10:46.091
Scotch and soda
and a glass of milk.

10:46.212 --> 10:48.635
- "A glass of milk"?
- I'm on the wagon.

10:48.757 --> 10:51.476
I went to the doctor today
about these jitters...

10:51.634 --> 10:55.639
and he said it was the wagon
for a month or a new set of organs.

10:55.764 --> 10:57.687
I can't afford new organs.

10:57.807 --> 11:01.653
If I'd known you were on the wagon,
I could've got along without this...

11:01.770 --> 11:03.613
but as long as it's here...

11:03.730 --> 11:05.482
Good luck.

11:07.484 --> 11:11.205
- Good?
- Just like any other scotch and soda.

11:11.321 --> 11:13.244
That's what I thought.

11:14.616 --> 11:18.792
Doesn't taste the way it did when I
was a baby. That's got poison in it.

11:18.912 --> 11:21.165
Speaking of poison,
I got some pills...

11:21.331 --> 11:23.834
Oh, some cables have been
coming over from New York.

11:23.958 --> 11:27.178
They love to cable. Makes them
think you're working for them.

11:28.088 --> 11:31.342
There's an invitation to that lunch
for the Dutchman Van Meer tomorrow.

11:31.508 --> 11:33.226
I guess that's your dish.

11:33.343 --> 11:36.847
This is given by the Universal Peace Party.
That's Fisher's organization, isn't it?

11:36.971 --> 11:39.520
I don't know. I don't follow
those things very much.

11:39.682 --> 11:43.562
New York wants it, I send it. That's
the secret of being a correspondent.

11:43.686 --> 11:46.485
Been doing it 25 years.

11:46.606 --> 11:49.234
Twenty-five years,
and I end up on milk.

12:12.632 --> 12:14.885
- Good morning. How's the water wagon?
- Look at that.

12:15.009 --> 12:17.182
One of them shook off
this morning.

12:19.055 --> 12:22.229
Oh... well, I'm just on my way
to the Van Meer luncheon.

12:22.350 --> 12:25.695
I've got to have lunch here with old
man Clark. He's the international...

12:25.812 --> 12:29.112
Here you are. I didn't know whether
to meet you in the grill or upstairs.

12:29.232 --> 12:31.781
Hmm.
Good-bye, Stebbins.

12:31.901 --> 12:34.120
Good-bye,
Miss, uh, Clark.

12:34.237 --> 12:37.332
Who is he calling "Clark"?
He's got his nerve.

12:37.448 --> 12:39.667
Oh, some fresh
American reporter.

12:39.784 --> 12:42.253
<i>Good morning, Mr. Van Meer.</i>

12:45.832 --> 12:49.177
I beg your pardon, sir.
You are Mr. Van Meer, aren't you?

12:49.294 --> 12:50.887
That's my name, yes.

12:51.004 --> 12:53.553
My name's Haverstock.
You don't know me. I'm an American.

12:53.673 --> 12:55.912
I happened to be on my
way to your luncheon.

12:55.938 --> 12:56.497
Ah?

12:56.593 --> 12:59.016
- Then perhaps...
- That's very kind of you, sir...

12:59.137 --> 13:02.937
Come. Come, come.
It's all in a good cause.

13:03.099 --> 13:05.022
Savoy Hotel.

13:10.565 --> 13:14.445
- This is very kind of you, Mr. Van Meer.
- It's a pleasure, my boy.

13:14.569 --> 13:16.867
I dislike riding alone.

13:16.988 --> 13:19.411
One thinks too much
while riding alone.

13:19.532 --> 13:21.785
Yes, exactly.
The Polish situation...

13:21.951 --> 13:25.672
and the Dutch treaty with the Belgians
must be on your mind these days.

13:25.788 --> 13:28.632
What do you feel England
will do in case the Nazis...

13:28.791 --> 13:31.294
England is so beautiful, hmm?

13:31.419 --> 13:34.844
It's nice to see London
in the sunshine.

13:34.964 --> 13:38.639
Always there is lots
of rain or fog.

13:38.760 --> 13:40.603
Also, it is August.

13:40.720 --> 13:43.769
Yes, I found out it was August.
That was good for me.

13:43.890 --> 13:46.234
But would you mind
telling me how you feel...

13:46.351 --> 13:48.319
about Mr. Fisher and his
peace organization?

13:48.436 --> 13:50.313
You know Mr. Fisher?

13:50.438 --> 13:52.816
Oh, a very fine man.

13:52.941 --> 13:57.162
A good man. I wish there were more
like him in the world just now.

13:57.278 --> 14:00.782
Then I take it you don't think
there's much hope for peace.

14:00.907 --> 14:03.911
I mean, you don't think
one little peace organization...

14:04.035 --> 14:06.379
can make much headway
against the European war panic.

14:06.496 --> 14:10.672
I would like to think so.
Oh, look at those birds.

14:10.792 --> 14:14.763
<i>No matter how big the city,
there must always be parks...</i>

14:14.879 --> 14:17.723
and places for the birds to live.

14:17.840 --> 14:20.184
I was walking through the park
this morning...

14:20.343 --> 14:23.517
and I saw several people
feeding the birds.

14:23.638 --> 14:27.393
That's a good sign
at a time like this, is it not?

14:27.517 --> 14:29.019
Yes, it's a dandy sign...

14:29.185 --> 14:32.780
but I think right now the birds
are the least of our problems.

14:32.897 --> 14:35.366
Your country, for instance...
what might be its attitude...

14:35.483 --> 14:37.485
Oh, we're now near the Savoy.

14:42.115 --> 14:43.583
How much?

14:44.701 --> 14:46.829
A shilling.

14:46.953 --> 14:48.546
That's fine.

14:53.668 --> 14:55.545
By the way, young man...

14:55.670 --> 14:58.469
what newspaper
do you represent?

14:58.589 --> 15:01.468
As a matter of fact,
I'm not exactly a reporter...

15:01.592 --> 15:05.563
but I was trying to get you to talk,
and I didn't want bird talk either.

15:05.680 --> 15:07.523
I gathered that.

15:07.640 --> 15:11.486
Just what was it you were
trying to get me to tell you?

15:11.602 --> 15:16.028
I was trying to find out what you know
about the possibility of a general war.

15:16.149 --> 15:17.992
How do you really feel
about it?

15:18.109 --> 15:21.659
My boy,
I feel very old and sad...

15:22.739 --> 15:24.741
and helpless.

15:36.961 --> 15:39.089
Well, I did have one.

16:13.247 --> 16:15.841
The last news from Poland
was very alarming.

16:15.958 --> 16:19.007
- Nobody wants war, and yet...
- Then we don't have to have it.

16:19.128 --> 16:22.177
Miss Fisher, often circumstances
over which we have no control...

16:22.298 --> 16:25.723
Yes, those very convenient circumstances
over which we have no control.

16:25.843 --> 16:28.346
It always seems odd,
but they usually bring on war.

16:28.471 --> 16:31.350
You never hear of circumstances
over which we have no control...

16:31.474 --> 16:33.272
rushing us into peace,
do you?

16:33.393 --> 16:35.316
Very determined woman,
my daughter.

16:35.478 --> 16:39.108
Let's go and see if you can pick a fight
somewhere else. Excuse us.

16:39.232 --> 16:40.984
- Good for you.
- Wasn't he a bore?

16:41.150 --> 16:43.152
Many worthy people are.
How do you do?

16:43.277 --> 16:45.905
How would you like to be fishing
in Ireland at this minute?

16:46.030 --> 16:48.874
We haven't had a good sail
or swim together in months.

16:48.991 --> 16:50.993
Not even a game of cribbage.
Miss them?

16:51.160 --> 16:53.003
Up anchor, mate.
There's the admiral.

16:53.121 --> 16:55.795
He has a weakness for you.
Go do your stuff.

16:55.915 --> 16:58.418
Ah, here you are... the Jones
that became a Haverstock.

16:58.543 --> 17:01.672
Have a good trip? I still wish
you were Richard Harding Davis.

17:01.796 --> 17:04.015
- So do I, sir. Anything except...
- Hello.

17:04.173 --> 17:07.176
Hello. Meet Mrs. Appleby.
This is Huntley Haverstock...

17:07.300 --> 17:09.178
special correspondent,
<i>New York Globe.</i>

17:09.345 --> 17:11.222
- Foreign correspondent? Not really?
- Cross my heart.

17:11.347 --> 17:15.021
You look such a sweet boy. You don't
seem like the others... you know, greasy.

17:15.143 --> 17:17.396
- No?
- But I'm sure you're marvelous at it.

17:17.520 --> 17:19.897
I wonder if you know a friend,
Monty Rockingham.

17:20.021 --> 17:21.898
He's in the embassy
at Istanbul.

17:22.023 --> 17:23.696
Or is it Honolulu?

17:23.859 --> 17:26.363
Do help me with this distinguished-looking
gentleman over here.

17:26.487 --> 17:30.208
I can't make any headway with him, but
I'm sure he must speak some language.

17:30.366 --> 17:32.869
Everybody does.
I haven't the least idea who he is...

17:32.994 --> 17:35.747
but there isn't anybody here
who isn't internationally important.

17:35.872 --> 17:38.045
This is Mr. Haver-
Uh, Stock.

17:44.755 --> 17:46.382
No English?

17:47.258 --> 17:49.306
<i>Vous parlez francais?</i>

17:49.427 --> 17:51.600
- Try German.
<i>- Sprechen Sie Deutsch?</i>

17:51.721 --> 17:54.065
Splendid.
What else do you know?

17:54.182 --> 17:56.276
- Well, only pig latin.
- Pig la-

17:56.392 --> 17:58.565
Oh. Here we are.

17:58.686 --> 18:00.780
This'll do it.

18:00.897 --> 18:02.774
Ah.

18:02.899 --> 18:05.243
Now we're getting somewhere.
The universal language.

18:05.401 --> 18:07.074
Dear Maharaja.

18:12.617 --> 18:16.417
Ah.

18:18.664 --> 18:21.133
Well, they come in pairs.

18:21.250 --> 18:22.232
If you speak English,

18:22.258 --> 18:25.576
will you give me a hand with the
laughing Latvian? What's he talking?

18:25.671 --> 18:26.297
Latvian.

18:26.323 --> 18:28.825
No kidding? I didn't know
the Lats had a language.

18:28.925 --> 18:31.178
I thought they just
rubbed noses.

18:32.887 --> 18:35.060
You mean,
you actually speak Latvian?

18:35.181 --> 18:37.104
Oh, just enough to get about.

18:37.225 --> 18:40.229
What does "just enough
to get about" consist of in Latvia?

18:40.353 --> 18:42.572
Well, I don't think
you'd have any trouble.

18:42.688 --> 18:45.111
That'll be a comfort
when I get to Latvia.

18:45.233 --> 18:47.656
<i>You think there
might be a chance soon?</i>

18:47.777 --> 18:49.620
You never can tell
in my racket.

18:49.737 --> 18:51.995
I suppose you've guessed
I'm a foreign correspondent.

18:52.021 --> 18:53.107
Are you?
That's nice.

18:55.368 --> 18:58.372
I see you're taking notes.
Are you covering this affair too?

18:58.496 --> 19:00.999
- I sort of work here.
- Oh, publicity!

19:01.123 --> 19:03.000
You're just the one
I'm looking for.

19:03.125 --> 19:05.423
We've got to go
in a secret conference right away.

19:05.545 --> 19:06.762
Oh.

19:06.879 --> 19:08.631
Uh...

19:10.132 --> 19:12.430
Me? Excuse me.

19:12.552 --> 19:15.431
I beg your pardon,
but I have a Latvian friend here...

19:15.555 --> 19:17.899
who's particularly interested
in the origin of the kilt.

19:18.015 --> 19:21.736
I wonder if you'd be interested in
talking to him. He's a lovely fellow.

19:21.852 --> 19:25.106
It's a most amazing story.
You see...

19:25.231 --> 19:28.451
the Greeks, in the early period,
they used to wear a kilt.

19:28.568 --> 19:31.492
What is this big secret
conference all about?

19:31.612 --> 19:33.614
It's no secret
as far as I'm concerned.

19:33.739 --> 19:36.492
However, I'll let you in
on that part later.

19:36.617 --> 19:38.961
But since you're handling
the publicity for this outfit...

19:39.078 --> 19:41.266
you might give me a line
on what it's about...

19:41.292 --> 19:43.199
this League for Peace
and Understanding.

19:43.332 --> 19:45.175
What is it you'd like to know?

19:45.334 --> 19:48.213
First, is this Mr. Fisher
entirely on the level?

19:48.337 --> 19:51.682
- Very much so.
- He seems like a very nice guy.

19:51.841 --> 19:53.514
He is, I assure you.

19:53.634 --> 19:56.308
Well, what is it that
makes him, or you, think...

19:56.429 --> 19:59.353
that an organization like this,
made up of well-meaning amateurs...

19:59.515 --> 20:01.813
buck up against those tough
military boys of Europe?

20:01.934 --> 20:04.153
It's the "well-meaning amateurs,"
as you call them...

20:04.270 --> 20:06.864
who do the fighting
when the war comes, isn't it?

20:07.023 --> 20:09.446
<i>- Luncheon is served.</i>
- Please don't go yet.

20:09.567 --> 20:11.865
You don't want any of
those dreary chicken patties.

20:11.986 --> 20:13.738
I'm sorry. I must go.

20:13.863 --> 20:15.865
Then sit at the press
table with me.

20:16.032 --> 20:19.036
Nobody listens to the speeches
at the press table. We could talk.

20:19.201 --> 20:21.454
- You don't know my name yet.
- Is it necessary?

20:21.579 --> 20:24.082
It is to me.
Don't mind if you hear...

20:24.206 --> 20:27.460
it's Huntley Haverstock,
because it's really Jones.

20:27.585 --> 20:30.555
- What's yours?
- Mine's really Smith.

20:30.713 --> 20:33.057
Don't mind if you hear
it's anything else.

20:38.679 --> 20:41.307
- Waiter?
- Yes, sir?

20:41.432 --> 20:43.434
Same young lady.
Try again.

20:43.559 --> 20:45.857
I have taken the
young lady 13 notes, sir.

20:45.978 --> 20:48.197
She won't accept any more.

20:51.400 --> 20:54.074
Milords, ladies...

20:54.236 --> 20:56.580
and gentlemen...

20:56.697 --> 20:59.541
pray silence
for your chairman...

20:59.659 --> 21:01.957
Mr. Stephen Fisher.

21:04.288 --> 21:06.586
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have an announcement to make...

21:06.749 --> 21:09.548
which I'm sure will be
a great disappointment to us all.

21:09.669 --> 21:12.092
I've just received this telegram
from Mr. Van Meer...

21:12.213 --> 21:15.717
<i>who was to have been
our guest of honor today.</i>

21:15.841 --> 21:19.436
"Deeply regret. Called away suddenly
owing to unforeseen circumstances.

21:19.553 --> 21:22.102
<i>I will be unable to attend
your meeting as planned</i>

21:22.264 --> 21:24.983
<i>I am with you and your
work with all my heart.</i>

21:25.101 --> 21:27.695
<i>I could not have said more
had I been there."</i>

21:29.271 --> 21:32.366
Although this removes one of our
star attractions at the luncheon...

21:32.483 --> 21:34.656
we may have more time
to tell you...

21:34.777 --> 21:37.121
from the inside
what this party has stood for...

21:37.238 --> 21:39.866
<i>and why we've asked you
here today.</i>

21:39.990 --> 21:42.834
I can think of no one
more competent to do this...

21:42.952 --> 21:45.250
than the speaker
I am about to introduce.

21:45.371 --> 21:47.794
I trust you will not think
this is a family affair...

21:47.957 --> 21:49.925
when I say I refer to my daughter...

21:50.042 --> 21:52.921
<i>Miss Carol Fisher.</i>

21:59.301 --> 22:00.974
<i>Milords...</i>

22:01.095 --> 22:03.769
ladies and gentlemen...

22:03.889 --> 22:06.483
<i>pray silence for Miss Carol Fisher.</i>

22:16.026 --> 22:17.494
Ladies and gentlemen...

22:17.611 --> 22:21.707
<i>I trust that, even making allowances
for a father's exuberance...</i>

22:21.824 --> 22:25.328
you do not think I'm in any way
being put forward today...

22:25.453 --> 22:27.626
<i>as a substitute
for Mr. Van Meer.</i>

22:27.747 --> 22:31.968
<i>Unhappily for us, no one
can take Mr. Van Meer's place.</i>

22:32.084 --> 22:35.179
What I can do, possibly, is
to clear up a few misapprehensions...

22:35.337 --> 22:38.432
that seem to have crept into the
public discussion of this movement...

22:38.549 --> 22:41.598
and revise some
of the epithets applied to us...

22:41.719 --> 22:45.690
<i>by some who have not gone as deeply
into the matter as they might.</i>

22:45.806 --> 22:48.605
The female of the "speeches"
is deadlier than the male.

22:48.726 --> 22:50.854
...as a group
of well-meaning amateurs.

22:50.978 --> 22:54.482
I'm sure there are some of you here
who think of us as such.

22:54.607 --> 22:58.453
I should like to ask anyone who has
called us "well-meaning amateurs"...

22:58.569 --> 23:01.368
to stand up by his chair
and tell me just why...

23:01.489 --> 23:03.958
a well-meaning amateur
is any less reliable...

23:04.074 --> 23:06.577
than a well-meaning professional
at a moment like this...

23:06.702 --> 23:08.420
<i>but I'll not take the time.</i>

23:08.537 --> 23:11.837
<i>I think the world has been run long
enough by the well-meaning professional.</i>

23:11.957 --> 23:14.005
<i>We might give the amateurs
their chance now.</i>

23:14.126 --> 23:17.756
But what I really want to do
is give you a brief idea of...

23:17.880 --> 23:20.474
just...

23:21.759 --> 23:25.229
just how far-reaching
our amateur plans are.

23:28.182 --> 23:30.560
Use your notes.

23:30.684 --> 23:33.403
And, uh, just...

23:33.562 --> 23:35.405
why we ask for your support...

23:35.564 --> 23:37.783
professional or amateur.

23:37.900 --> 23:39.652
What I mean is that...

23:39.777 --> 23:42.747
however much one may...

23:44.907 --> 23:47.410
I mean, we should both...

23:49.161 --> 23:51.163
both of us...

25:14.788 --> 25:16.790
Better to wait in there.

25:18.125 --> 25:21.174
- Mr. Fisher, how are you?
- When did you get over?

25:21.295 --> 25:24.845
Just now. I had a cable from Mr. Powers.
This is my first assignment.

25:24.965 --> 25:28.686
Rather ironic assignment: a peace
conference in the shadow of war.

25:28.844 --> 25:30.056
You mean it's really coming?

25:30.082 --> 25:32.339
Today and tomorrow will tell.
There's still hope.

25:32.431 --> 25:35.025
- I'm going back to London today.
- Leaving for London?

25:35.142 --> 25:37.691
I only just got here.
The conference is just beginning.

25:37.811 --> 25:41.486
Today and tomorrow, the work of peace must
be done in London rather than Amsterdam.

25:41.607 --> 25:45.487
Are you taking your whole staff
to London with you, including your...

25:45.611 --> 25:49.206
No, someone staying here will see
you're given all the help you need.

25:49.365 --> 25:51.709
You'll be in very good hands.
Here she is.

25:53.285 --> 25:55.583
- Mrs. Appleby, Mr. Haverstock.
- We met at the luncheon.

25:55.704 --> 25:57.584
You remember
Mr. , don't you?

25:57.706 --> 25:59.754
He's nice, but I still
can't understand him.

25:59.875 --> 26:03.175
Dr. Williamson, Mr. Huntley Haverstock
represents the New York Globe.

26:03.295 --> 26:06.014
He's unfamiliar with Amsterdam
and the machinery of peace meetings.

26:06.131 --> 26:08.509
Would you take him
under your wing?

26:08.634 --> 26:10.828
Perhaps you and Mrs. Appleby
might see he samples

26:10.854 --> 26:12.960
eight or ten varieties
of Dutch cheese tonight.

26:13.055 --> 26:14.853
Now I must see
what unlucky person...

26:14.974 --> 26:18.023
is going to give up his seat
to me on that plane.

26:18.143 --> 26:20.441
Don't get into any mischief,
will you?

26:20.562 --> 26:23.065
- "Mischief"?
- Your first visit to Amsterdam?

26:23.190 --> 26:23.816
Yes.

26:23.842 --> 26:26.344
You must let me take you
to Rembrandt's house...

26:26.443 --> 26:30.243
It might be a good idea if we went
over the agenda of the conference.

26:30.364 --> 26:32.867
<i>If you'll excuse me,
I see a friend.</i>

26:45.170 --> 26:47.264
Mr. Van Meer, how are you?

26:47.381 --> 26:50.260
We seemed to lose each other
the day before yesterday.

26:50.384 --> 26:52.728
I'm so sorry
you were called away.

26:52.845 --> 26:54.643
Don't you remember me?

26:54.763 --> 26:58.393
We shared the same cab
on the way to the luncheon.

26:58.517 --> 27:01.396
Excuse me. May I have
your picture, Mr. Van Meer?

27:01.520 --> 27:02.988
Thank you.

27:16.618 --> 27:18.871
There he goes!

28:13.884 --> 28:15.761
Follow that car! Quick!

28:20.140 --> 28:22.643
Oh.

28:22.768 --> 28:25.271
- You better get out of here.
- Don't be silly. Drive on.

28:28.941 --> 28:30.693
- Who's he shot?
- Van Meer. Assassinated.

28:30.818 --> 28:32.286
- Dead?
- Looked like it.

28:32.402 --> 28:32.946
Bad show.

28:32.972 --> 28:35.146
Couldn't be much worse,
from his point of view.

28:39.034 --> 28:41.537
Do you mind shoving
your knees out of the way?

29:02.099 --> 29:04.318
You'd better hop
in the back, old girl.

29:04.434 --> 29:06.061
Hurry.

29:12.359 --> 29:14.282
Safety glass.
I wonder whose make.

29:14.403 --> 29:17.031
- Good chauffeur you've got, Miss Fisher.
- Yes, isn't he?

29:17.156 --> 29:18.749
- You two know each other?
- Yeah.

29:18.907 --> 29:21.535
I forgot. This is Scott ffolliott.
Newspaperman, same as you.

29:21.660 --> 29:23.128
Roaming correspondent.

29:23.245 --> 29:25.245
<i>- Mr. Haverstock, Mr. ffolliott.</i>
- With a double F.

29:25.247 --> 29:27.249
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

29:27.416 --> 29:30.590
- I don't get the double F.
- At the beginning. Both small Fs.

29:30.711 --> 29:32.044
It can't be at
the beginning.

29:32.070 --> 29:34.912
One of my ancestors had his
head chopped off by Henry VIII.

29:35.007 --> 29:37.681
His wife dropped the capital letter
to commemorate the occasion.

29:37.801 --> 29:39.269
<i>There it is.</i>

29:40.387 --> 29:44.267
- How do you say it? Like a stutter?
- No, just straight "fuh."

30:04.203 --> 30:06.530
It's stopped raining.
The sun's coming out.

30:06.556 --> 30:07.983
The police are coming.

30:34.191 --> 30:36.990
That's the most amazing
disappearing trick I've ever seen.

30:40.781 --> 30:43.330
Don't suppose they could've
got up that high, do you?

30:55.963 --> 30:58.682
Vanished.

31:01.385 --> 31:03.262
Take a look for yourself,
old boy.

31:03.387 --> 31:05.765
Tell him your name,
about the two small Fs.

31:05.889 --> 31:08.438
That would be a bit over his head.

31:12.396 --> 31:14.398
Well, this isn't catching
any assassins.

31:14.523 --> 31:17.317
We should've kept one of those
policemen and played bridge.

31:17.343 --> 31:18.553
I guess you're right.

31:19.611 --> 31:22.034
Oh

31:23.532 --> 31:26.035
I'll bet 2 to 1 on the derby.

31:50.684 --> 31:52.903
Look at those sails
on that windmill.

31:53.061 --> 31:55.814
You'll get used to those
when you've been in Holland longer.

31:58.025 --> 32:00.574
I could've sworn
they were going against the wind.

32:00.694 --> 32:03.538
Why don't you lie down
on the grass and cool off?

32:03.655 --> 32:07.159
In due time, but first I want you
to get the police back here.

32:07.284 --> 32:08.048
The police again?

32:08.074 --> 32:10.859
We don't want the police.
I've decided not to prosecute.

32:10.954 --> 32:12.874
You'll get the police,
'cause our man's in there.

32:12.914 --> 32:14.131
- Where?
- In that mill.

32:14.249 --> 32:17.753
- What makes you think so?
- A lot can happen while I'm explaining.

32:17.919 --> 32:21.014
Please get the police.
I'd go if I spoke the language.

32:21.131 --> 32:22.974
- What'll you do?
- A bit of snooping.

32:23.091 --> 32:25.389
I hate to seem executive,
but this is serious.

32:25.510 --> 32:28.138
- Come on, Scott.
- All right. You shall have your police.

32:55.457 --> 32:58.882
it's a signal.
It's a signal for that plane to land.

35:35.116 --> 35:37.494
<i>Oh.</i>

35:37.619 --> 35:40.247
Ah, come in...

35:40.372 --> 35:42.841
and close the door, mister.

35:44.501 --> 35:47.630
<i>Mr. Van Meer.
It isn't possible.</i>

35:50.131 --> 35:52.850
I've just been given a drug...

35:52.968 --> 35:54.845
drug of some sort.

35:54.970 --> 35:58.645
But I saw you shot just now
outside the conference hall! I saw it!

35:59.724 --> 36:01.977
They gave it to me...

36:02.102 --> 36:04.321
when they moved me from...

36:05.647 --> 36:07.945
Ah, it's beginning now. I...

36:08.066 --> 36:10.285
The man I saw shot
was a dead image!

36:10.402 --> 36:12.746
The man you saw shot...

36:12.862 --> 36:14.956
that wasn't me.

36:15.073 --> 36:17.451
He was a subs-

36:17.576 --> 36:20.420
substitute that looked like me.

36:20.537 --> 36:21.959
But why? What...

36:22.080 --> 36:26.460
They... They want
the world to think...

36:26.585 --> 36:29.680
that I've been assassinated.

36:29.796 --> 36:31.343
Yes.

36:31.506 --> 36:34.635
To conceal the fact...

36:34.759 --> 36:36.557
that I am in their hands.

36:36.678 --> 36:39.272
"Their hands"?
Who are "they"?

36:40.557 --> 36:43.060
I can't explain.

36:43.184 --> 36:46.279
I'm not cert-

36:46.396 --> 36:48.194
This drug...

36:48.315 --> 36:50.568
I can hardly think.

36:53.194 --> 36:55.242
All I can tell you is that...

36:55.363 --> 36:59.038
they are going
to take me away by plane...

37:00.118 --> 37:03.122
like a bird.

37:03.246 --> 37:06.466
Always are places
in the city...

37:06.583 --> 37:09.928
where birds can get crumbs.

37:12.464 --> 37:15.638
Birds. Cru-

37:15.759 --> 37:17.227
Oh, quickly.

37:19.095 --> 37:20.688
A pencil.

41:07.448 --> 41:10.668
You see? Old mill.

41:10.785 --> 41:13.504
Up the road.

41:13.621 --> 41:15.623
Look.

41:15.748 --> 41:17.341
Man.

41:18.459 --> 41:20.632
Old mill. Understand?

41:20.753 --> 41:22.630
Does anyone here
speak English?

41:22.755 --> 41:25.133
English? We speak English
in the school.

41:25.258 --> 41:28.478
Why have you been holding out on me?
Tell these two policemen...

41:28.595 --> 41:30.313
to come with me.

41:30.471 --> 41:33.645
Very, very important.
Big old prisoner. Old mill.

41:33.766 --> 41:36.315
Tell them to follow me.
Do you understand?

41:42.942 --> 41:44.364
Yeah.

41:51.200 --> 41:53.999
Yeah. That's what I've been
trying to tell you. Come on.

42:15.350 --> 42:16.977
They've gone.

42:30.031 --> 42:31.749
They've killed him.

42:38.915 --> 42:40.337
<i>But if isn't...</i>

42:40.458 --> 42:42.210
Who are you?

42:43.711 --> 42:45.713
Where are the others?

42:51.052 --> 42:53.805
There's been a frame-up.
Ask him where the others have gone.

43:01.479 --> 43:04.949
He says he doesn't know what you're
talking about. There are no other people.

43:05.066 --> 43:07.034
He's been asleep here all day.

43:07.151 --> 43:10.200
He's lying. I talked to Van
Meer in this very room.

43:18.538 --> 43:20.632
Well, there's one thing
I can show you...

43:20.748 --> 43:22.876
the assassin's car,
the one we followed.

43:30.508 --> 43:34.058
A unique specimen, old boy. The only
one-horse sports car in the world.

43:34.178 --> 43:37.603
That car was here!
Listen, I know I look a fool...

43:37.724 --> 43:39.943
but there's something fishy
going on around here.

43:40.059 --> 43:42.608
<i>There's a big story in this.
I can smell it...</i>

43:42.770 --> 43:45.614
<i>and I'm going to get
to the bottom of it.</i>

43:45.732 --> 43:47.905
<i>And nothing's gonna stop me,
do you understand?</i>

43:48.026 --> 43:52.076
<i>I'm going to prove that that was not Van
Meer that was assassinated but his double.</i>

44:12.633 --> 44:14.180
Who is it?

44:16.179 --> 44:18.728
All right, come in.

44:25.104 --> 44:27.857
- Mr. Haverstock?
- Yes.

44:27.982 --> 44:30.280
What are you, the house detective?
You weren't announced.

44:30.401 --> 44:32.654
I'm sorry, sir.
We asked at the desk.

44:32.820 --> 44:35.994
Policemen, huh? Don't tell me you're
here to apologize about the windmill.

44:36.115 --> 44:38.618
No, sir. We simply want you
to come with us...

44:38.743 --> 44:40.996
and tell your story
to our chief of police.

44:41.162 --> 44:44.166
Does this chief of police speak English?
I'm a very busy man.

44:44.290 --> 44:47.840
It will take no more than half an
hour, sir. We all speak English.

44:48.002 --> 44:50.801
That's marvelous. That's more
than I can say for my country.

44:50.922 --> 44:53.721
Would you sit down?
I have to make a phone call.

44:53.841 --> 44:55.843
Dinner date
with a young lady.

45:10.733 --> 45:14.112
The exchange doesn't answer.
Well, I'll call later.

45:14.237 --> 45:17.036
Look, I'm a very quick bather.
Would you excuse me...

45:17.156 --> 45:19.909
while I jump in the tub
and give myself a shave?

45:20.034 --> 45:22.162
Look at some magazines.
I'll be right back.

45:22.286 --> 45:25.129
You couldn't bring the chief
of police here, could you?

45:25.155 --> 45:26.282
<i>No, I am afraid not.</i>

45:26.374 --> 45:28.092
No, I thought not.

46:39.947 --> 46:43.793
- Please don't bother to come.
- You'll find it on my dressing table.

46:58.424 --> 47:01.303
Well, we meet again.

47:01.427 --> 47:03.179
So it seems.

47:03.304 --> 47:06.057
Quite a lot's happened
since I last saw you.

47:06.182 --> 47:08.480
- So I see.
- Uh...

47:08.601 --> 47:12.401
I, uh, had quite a chase
after that guy outside Amsterdam.

47:12.521 --> 47:15.240
It's quite a country.
It's interesting. Windmills and tulips.

47:15.358 --> 47:17.326
Did you find
everything you...

47:19.528 --> 47:23.499
We were just talking about the tulips.
Don't seem to be any.

47:23.658 --> 47:25.877
I really think
I should be going now.

47:27.078 --> 47:29.126
Thank you very much
for the powder.

47:29.247 --> 47:31.500
Oh, must you really go now?

47:31.666 --> 47:33.259
Yes, I must be going now.

47:33.376 --> 47:35.595
<i>Really.</i>

47:37.797 --> 47:39.549
Good-bye.

47:45.680 --> 47:47.666
You've made quite a
day of it, haven't you?

47:47.692 --> 47:48.549
Shh! Listen...

47:48.683 --> 47:51.482
Made monkeys out of ffolliott and me,
broken into my bedroom...

47:51.602 --> 47:53.980
and disgraced me
before a friend of my father's.

47:54.105 --> 47:55.778
What are your plans now?

47:55.898 --> 47:57.662
You might at least have
had your clothes on.

47:57.688 --> 47:58.392
Take it easy.

47:58.484 --> 47:59.586
This is serious business.

47:59.612 --> 48:01.683
I've seen your "serious
business" before.

48:01.779 --> 48:03.622
- What are you doing?
- Escaping.

48:03.739 --> 48:04.358
From what?

48:04.384 --> 48:06.859
A couple fellows in my
room about to kill me.

48:06.951 --> 48:07.752
May I ask who?

48:07.778 --> 48:10.981
Two gentlemen disguised as policemen
waiting to take me for a ride.

48:11.080 --> 48:13.883
Don't you think you've been talking
through your hat long enough?

48:13.909 --> 48:14.609
I'm not!

48:14.709 --> 48:17.383
I've thrown a monkey wrench
into some international dirty business.

48:17.545 --> 48:20.765
I know Van Meer's alive.
That's the reason they want to kill me.

48:20.881 --> 48:23.179
- I can think of others.
- You've got to help me...

48:23.301 --> 48:26.225
not for my sake, but this is
the biggest story in Europe.

48:26.345 --> 48:29.984
Your childish mind is as out of place
in Europe as you are in my bedroom.

48:31.058 --> 48:32.685
Get over there.

48:36.981 --> 48:39.575
Ah.

48:49.535 --> 48:51.333
You see what you're doing,
don't you?

48:51.454 --> 48:54.754
This is going straight back to London.
We'll be common gossip by tomorrow.

48:54.874 --> 48:57.969
I don't care for myself,
but my father's engaged in great work.

48:58.085 --> 49:02.215
He's trying to help avert a dreadful war.
This is just the thing to discredit him.

49:02.340 --> 49:05.344
I know you care nothing about our work.
All you're interested in...

49:05.468 --> 49:07.470
is having fun with windmills
and hotel bathrooms.

49:07.595 --> 49:09.347
You don't believe
I'm in trouble.

49:09.472 --> 49:13.852
You'll be in plenty of trouble if you don't
get out. For the last time, please go.

49:17.938 --> 49:21.943
Okay, but I want you to know exactly
what's going to happen when I do go.

49:22.068 --> 49:26.448
<i>I'll go back to my room and try to shake
those fellows off, but I won't succeed.</i>

49:26.572 --> 49:30.076
They'll stick to me like a couple
of tattoo marks until they get me.

49:30.201 --> 49:33.580
They'll stop at nothing. I seem to
know too much, and they're right.

49:33.704 --> 49:36.378
I don't know the ins and outs
of your crackpot movement...

49:36.499 --> 49:39.548
<i>and what's wrong with Europe,
but I do know a story...</i>

49:39.668 --> 49:43.298
and I'll keep after it until either
I get it or it gets me.

49:43.464 --> 49:45.933
Sorry you have those
derogatory opinions of me...

49:46.050 --> 49:48.223
<i>but I guess that can't be helped.</i>

49:48.344 --> 49:51.518
<i>Well, so long.</i>

49:51.639 --> 49:54.313
It's been nice knowing you.

49:56.560 --> 49:57.982
I said "good-bye."

50:04.693 --> 50:05.990
Don't go.

50:09.698 --> 50:12.827
Oh, I guess I could've handled
those fellows all right, with luck.

50:12.952 --> 50:15.205
We mustn't take chances.
We should get some help.

50:15.329 --> 50:17.377
That's what I had
in mind at first.

50:17.498 --> 50:19.466
I'll get Dr. Williamson
and Mr. Van...

50:19.583 --> 50:22.132
Not with me this way.
They might not understand.

50:22.253 --> 50:24.176
They have understood.

50:30.845 --> 50:34.645
We could catch the boat to England
and see Father if you could get out.

50:34.765 --> 50:37.359
That's the hitch. What's that friend
of yours? f-f something.

50:37.476 --> 50:40.855
- ffolliott.
- Give me Mr. ffolliott's room, please.

50:40.980 --> 50:42.527
Left the hotel?

50:42.690 --> 50:44.738
That's strange.
We were to dine together tonight.

50:44.859 --> 50:46.623
He realized how
much I meant to you.

50:46.649 --> 50:48.889
You'd mean much more
with your clothes on.

50:49.029 --> 50:51.268
You like the intellectual type.
Say, I've got an idea.

50:51.294 --> 50:51.853
What?

50:51.949 --> 50:54.498
The manager, please.
Buzz for the valet, will you?

50:54.618 --> 50:58.464
Hello, is this the manager?
This is Mr. Haverstock in 537.

50:58.581 --> 51:01.209
What kind of a hotel is this?
My bathtub leaks...

51:01.333 --> 51:03.586
my phone's out of order,
and I've been robbed.

51:03.711 --> 51:06.555
Will you send somebody up
right away? Thank you.

51:07.673 --> 51:10.552
Operator, send a waiter up to 537.

51:10.676 --> 51:13.179
And ask the chambermaid
to bring up clean sheets.

51:13.304 --> 51:15.056
I've set mine on fire.

51:15.222 --> 51:19.318
And I'd like a window-cleaner, and ask
boots to come up and get my shoes.

51:19.435 --> 51:21.437
And hurry it up.
That's a good girl.

51:21.562 --> 51:23.989
That'll clutter up that
room for those two guys.

51:25.065 --> 51:27.614
It's the valet.
Come in.

51:27.735 --> 51:29.157
- Do you speak English?
- Yes, sir.

51:29.278 --> 51:32.077
- Go to my room, 537...
- 537.

51:32.198 --> 51:34.997
And get me a shirt, tie,
suit, and a hat.

51:36.744 --> 51:39.748
You see, my husband's waiting
in the room for this gentleman.

53:01.370 --> 53:04.965
No sign of them yet.
Come on, let's hide in the cabin.

53:11.338 --> 53:13.682
- Full up, sir. Sorry.
- Not even a small cabin?

53:13.799 --> 53:16.518
Not a thing.
Everybody in a hurry to get home.

53:16.677 --> 53:20.682
I see. I have a rare bank note here
you might be interested in.

53:20.806 --> 53:22.979
That is, if you collect
rare bank notes.

53:23.100 --> 53:26.695
Sir, I'd do it if I could,
but there just isn't a place left.

53:26.854 --> 53:30.404
Aboard an English ship you come up
against such an air of incorruptibility.

53:30.524 --> 53:33.528
As a matter of fact, sir,
I just had a cabin returned.

53:33.694 --> 53:36.163
- Can I have your name, sir?
- Oh.

53:36.280 --> 53:39.329
One cabin isn't going to do us
much good. We just can't...

53:39.450 --> 53:43.000
I fully intended to sleep in the lounge.
I hope you didn't think I...

53:43.120 --> 53:45.498
No, of course not.
It's very kind of you.

53:45.623 --> 53:47.375
Fine. I'll take it.

53:47.541 --> 53:49.794
I'm sorry, sir.
I'm afraid it's too late now.

53:49.918 --> 53:54.264
You seemed to have some doubt about taking
it. I had to let that gentleman have it.

53:54.381 --> 53:57.635
Oh, that's too bad.
It's such a rare five-pound note too.

53:57.760 --> 54:00.434
The watermark's upside down.
I think you'd have loved it.

54:00.554 --> 54:02.727
Well, perhaps next time.

54:43.138 --> 54:45.641
Were you really going to tip
that man five pounds?

54:45.766 --> 54:48.565
Of course. I charge all
my traveling expenses to the office.

54:48.686 --> 54:50.529
Corrupting an official:
five pounds.

54:50.646 --> 54:53.240
You're just a wee bit
unscrupulous, aren't you?

54:53.357 --> 54:55.826
Not unscrupulous.
Just in love.

54:55.943 --> 54:59.823
- It's the same thing, I suppose.
- I beg your pardon?

54:59.947 --> 55:02.075
I beg yours.

55:02.199 --> 55:04.952
You see, I love you
and I want to marry you.

55:08.288 --> 55:10.711
I love you,
and I want to marry you.

55:11.959 --> 55:15.429
Well, that cuts our love scene down
quite a bit, doesn't it?

55:15.546 --> 55:18.800
- Do you mind?
- Not at all. It's made a new man of me.

55:18.966 --> 55:21.469
I hope not entirely new.
It took me some time...

55:21.593 --> 55:23.971
to get used
to the first man you were.

55:24.138 --> 55:27.142
To be perfectly frank,
I expected a little more argument.

55:27.266 --> 55:30.270
I'm left with quite a few things
I wanted to say.

55:30.394 --> 55:33.648
Save them until after we're married.
I imagine they'll sound much better then.

55:33.814 --> 55:35.407
I'd saved things to say then too.

55:35.524 --> 55:38.573
You were really quite sure
of yourself, weren't you?

55:38.694 --> 55:40.742
Funny... I didn't think
I had a chance.

55:40.863 --> 55:42.945
A guy's got a right to
dream, though, hasn't he?

55:42.971 --> 55:43.607
Evidently.

55:43.699 --> 55:46.043
Do you think your father
will understand?

55:46.160 --> 55:49.164
I think Father
will be delighted, frankly.

56:09.349 --> 56:10.976
Right, sir.

56:18.776 --> 56:20.995
- Good morning, Miss Carol.
- Good morning, Stiles.

56:21.111 --> 56:24.581
- This is Mr. Haverstock. Is Father up yet?
- Yes, miss. He's having breakfast.

56:24.698 --> 56:26.371
Come on.

56:31.705 --> 56:34.333
- Hello, Father.
- What are you doing in London?

56:34.458 --> 56:36.881
Jo... Mr. Haverstock
brought me back on the boat.

56:37.002 --> 56:39.596
Nothing wrong, is there?
You're not ill? You look healthy.

56:39.713 --> 56:41.215
No, I'm fine.
It's Mr. Haverstock.

56:41.381 --> 56:43.383
I hope you don't mind
my barging in.

56:43.509 --> 56:47.355
On the contrary. I'm delighted.
You cover a lot of territory, don't you?

56:47.471 --> 56:48.731
<i>You didn't even send a wire.</i>

56:48.757 --> 56:51.592
<i>Just for that, I hope your trip
was perfectly uncomfortable.</i>

56:51.725 --> 56:54.194
It wasn't so bad.
We couldn't get cabins...

56:54.311 --> 56:56.484
but we managed
to sleep on the deck.

56:56.605 --> 56:58.699
Monsieur Krug.
How nice to see you again.

56:58.816 --> 57:00.818
Mr. Haverstock,
Monsieur Krug.

57:03.237 --> 57:06.241
Monsieur Krug is a member
of the Borovian Embassy staff here.

57:06.406 --> 57:08.408
Sit down.
Have a spot of breakfast.

57:08.534 --> 57:11.037
I know I should tidy up,
but I'm simply starved.

57:15.582 --> 57:18.051
So you were in Amsterdam
yesterday, Mr. Haverstock?

57:18.168 --> 57:20.921
Poor Van Meer. I count his death
a heavy personal loss.

57:21.088 --> 57:22.965
Of all people, why Van Meer?

57:23.090 --> 57:26.390
You can't ask "why" of an assassin.
There's no logic in killing.

57:26.510 --> 57:29.559
We can't spare such men
in a world like ours.

57:29.680 --> 57:32.308
Did you by any chance meet him,
Mr. Haverstock?

57:32.432 --> 57:34.560
Not formally,
but I saw him die.

57:35.853 --> 57:37.230
Horrible.

57:37.354 --> 57:41.234
As a matter of fact, I chased the man
that shot him and almost caught him.

57:41.358 --> 57:44.578
Mr. Haverstock is a newspaperman,
Monsieur Krug.

57:44.695 --> 57:47.014
That would be quite a
coup, bringing in your

57:47.040 --> 57:49.100
first story wrapped
around an assassin.

57:50.868 --> 57:53.417
I shall have to be
getting along now, Mr. Fisher.

57:54.955 --> 57:58.334
Shall we settle on the wording
for the peace petition now or later?

57:58.458 --> 58:01.803
We may as well clear it up
in the study. You'll excuse us?

58:01.920 --> 58:04.548
Father, could I speak to you?
It's terribly important.

58:04.673 --> 58:08.348
This won't take a moment. Meanwhile, see
if you can't interest Mr. Haverstock...

58:08.468 --> 58:10.687
in some eggs and bacon.

58:10.804 --> 58:12.556
Mr. Fisher... What's
that man doing here?

58:12.582 --> 58:13.582
It's Monsieur Krug.

58:13.682 --> 58:15.935
- Van Meer isn't dead.
- But I just read...

58:16.059 --> 58:18.107
That was his double.
Van Meer was kidnapped.

58:18.228 --> 58:20.276
I talked to him in a
mill outside Amsterdam.

58:20.302 --> 58:21.803
What has Krug to do with it?

58:21.899 --> 58:24.069
Remember my description
of the man in the mill?

58:24.095 --> 58:25.269
You mean the sweater?

58:25.360 --> 58:27.988
Of course! But that's impossible.
We've known Monsieur Krug...

58:28.155 --> 58:31.101
Mr. Krug brought Van Meer here by
plane last night. He's in England.

58:31.127 --> 58:31.980
They're hiding him.

58:32.075 --> 58:33.132
Positive about this?

58:33.158 --> 58:35.695
I was as close to Krug
as I am to you now.

58:35.829 --> 58:38.274
<i>It'd be terrible if we made a mistake.
On the other hand...</i>

58:38.300 --> 58:39.358
<i>Mr. Fisher.</i>

58:39.499 --> 58:41.501
Leave it to me.

58:46.548 --> 58:49.802
<i>I don't want to seem inhospitable,
but I must ask you to leave.</i>

58:49.927 --> 58:53.352
Mr. Haverstock is going to suggest
I turn you over to the police.

58:53.472 --> 58:56.851
Mr. Haverstock seems to be
something of a troublemaker.

58:56.975 --> 59:00.525
I thought you said he'd been taken
care of by our agents in Amsterdam.

59:00.646 --> 59:02.364
<i>I thought so too.</i>

59:02.481 --> 59:04.779
<i>I don't understand if,
unless perhaps...</i>

59:04.900 --> 59:08.325
Miss Fisher's being with him
may have caused complications.

59:08.445 --> 59:11.119
It would've been ideal
if she'd been in our confidence.

59:11.239 --> 59:13.116
Leave my daughter out of it.

59:13.241 --> 59:15.915
- I beg your pardon.
- Most unfortunate, his coming here.

59:16.036 --> 59:19.631
I've never had to cope with this sort
of thing before, thanks to you.

59:19.748 --> 59:22.046
Someone has to take care
of the sordid details.

59:22.167 --> 59:26.673
But this is close to home. In fact, it is
my home. After all, I'm only a politician.

59:26.797 --> 59:28.595
In a sense.

59:28.715 --> 59:32.060
And politicians aren't usually
called upon to, uh...

59:32.219 --> 59:34.392
do away with their guests,
are they?

59:34.513 --> 59:36.515
Quiet, boy. Quiet.

59:36.640 --> 59:39.063
Not in the house.
No, sir.

59:39.226 --> 59:42.150
But I have an idea.

59:47.859 --> 59:50.578
- Do you remember Rowley?
- Rowley?

59:50.696 --> 59:54.371
Yes, the little man who used to work
at your father's stables in Austria.

59:54.491 --> 59:58.621
Yes, I recall he was present
when a mutual friend of ours, um...

59:58.745 --> 01:00:01.498
accidentally fell off
the high bridge at Bern.

01:00:01.623 --> 01:00:03.250
He's retired now.

01:00:03.375 --> 01:00:05.628
Lives somewhere in
Clapham here in London.

01:00:05.752 --> 01:00:08.426
If Mr. Haverstock could be
induced to hire him...

01:00:08.547 --> 01:00:11.141
in the capacity
of a private detective...

01:00:11.258 --> 01:00:13.477
- What for?
- Well...

01:00:13.593 --> 01:00:17.348
you should warn him that it is
very dangerous to go about London...

01:00:17.472 --> 01:00:19.566
with the knowledge
that he has.

01:00:19.683 --> 01:00:22.607
Yes, I see. Yes.

01:00:23.603 --> 01:00:26.106
You use the English language
with great delicacy, Krug.

01:00:26.231 --> 01:00:29.235
Thank you, sir. I shall look
Mr. Rowley up at once...

01:00:29.359 --> 01:00:30.952
and give him his instructions.

01:00:31.069 --> 01:00:33.788
But you mustn't.
It would be too dangerous.

01:00:35.782 --> 01:00:37.618
What do we do?
Call Scotland Yard?

01:00:37.644 --> 01:00:40.108
I thought it best to
send Krug on his way.

01:00:40.203 --> 01:00:42.297
You let him get away?
Well, listen...

01:00:42.414 --> 01:00:46.294
Don't you see how important it is
not to rouse Krug's suspicions?

01:00:46.460 --> 01:00:49.464
- Van Meer will be killed immediately.
- Dead or alive, it's a story.

01:00:49.588 --> 01:00:51.261
Johnny, Father's right.

01:00:51.381 --> 01:00:54.885
- Okay, I'll cable them what I've got.
- I wouldn't if I were you.

01:00:55.010 --> 01:00:57.889
Van Meer's life may depend
upon our keeping this quiet.

01:00:58.013 --> 01:00:59.731
Keep it quiet?

01:00:59.848 --> 01:01:03.853
A famous diplomat's kidnapped under
my own eyes, and I muzzle myself?

01:01:03.977 --> 01:01:06.776
I'm sorry,
but this is a story with facts...

01:01:06.897 --> 01:01:10.652
the kind I was sent here to get,
the kind America's waiting for.

01:01:10.776 --> 01:01:13.575
It'll be bigger if you can wait
just a few hours...

01:01:13.695 --> 01:01:17.495
until we can find Van Meer and discover
what's behind this whole curious business.

01:01:17.616 --> 01:01:20.369
- I know what's behind it.
- I don't mean who's behind it.

01:01:20.494 --> 01:01:22.496
I mean the why of it.

01:01:22.621 --> 01:01:26.342
Dear, will you get me
all my correspondence with Krug?

01:01:26.458 --> 01:01:28.176
Please, Johnny,
do what Father says.

01:01:28.335 --> 01:01:30.838
It'll be best for you
and poor Mr. Van Meer.

01:01:31.004 --> 01:01:33.177
Okay. I'll wait.

01:01:36.551 --> 01:01:37.537
I'm worried about you.

01:01:37.563 --> 01:01:40.251
I'm a little worried about myself.
I feel weak-minded.

01:01:40.347 --> 01:01:43.851
You're doing the right thing, but I don't
like you dashing about without protection.

01:01:44.017 --> 01:01:44.568
Forget it.

01:01:44.594 --> 01:01:46.795
If what you say is true,
you need protection.

01:01:46.895 --> 01:01:49.161
I've covered beer mob
killings and race riots

01:01:49.187 --> 01:01:51.551
since I was a tot without
even a rabbit's foot.

01:01:51.650 --> 01:01:53.643
These people are
criminals, more dangerous

01:01:53.669 --> 01:01:55.521
than your rumrunners
and housebreakers.

01:01:55.612 --> 01:01:57.239
They're fanatics.

01:01:57.364 --> 01:01:59.478
They combine a mad
love of country with

01:01:59.504 --> 01:02:01.565
an equally mad
indifference to life...

01:02:01.701 --> 01:02:03.999
their own as well as others.

01:02:04.121 --> 01:02:06.715
They're cunning,
unscrupulous...

01:02:06.832 --> 01:02:09.085
and... inspired.

01:02:11.711 --> 01:02:14.089
And I really couldn't
face Mr. Powers again...

01:02:14.214 --> 01:02:18.060
if you didn't live long enough
to turn in the best story of the year.

01:02:18.176 --> 01:02:21.476
I'm gonna be a fine foreign correspondent
hiding in an attic somewhere.

01:02:21.596 --> 01:02:25.226
I'm not suggesting you hide anywhere.
Just get somebody to watch out for you.

01:02:25.392 --> 01:02:28.191
A nurse? Johnny Jones goes
to Europe and hires a nurse.

01:02:28.311 --> 01:02:30.939
That's gonna look great
on the expense account.

01:02:31.064 --> 01:02:34.910
I know a very efficient private detective
agency where we can get just the man.

01:02:35.068 --> 01:02:37.821
- Okay, whatever you say.
- I can arrange it all for you.

01:02:39.656 --> 01:02:42.830
If it'll make you feel better,
I won't mention it to anybody.

01:02:42.951 --> 01:02:46.751
If anyone finds out I've hired
a bodyguard, I'll shoot myself.

01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:01.099
If that's Mr. Rowley,
tell him to wait outside.

01:03:01.125 --> 01:03:01.795
Yes, sir.

01:03:02.971 --> 01:03:06.601
<i>I've called on Mr. Haverstock.
Will you tell him Mr. Rowley is here?</i>

01:03:06.725 --> 01:03:08.693
- Will you wait here, please?
- Thank you.

01:03:11.188 --> 01:03:14.112
- Mr. Haverstock, your cab's here.
- Where are you going?

01:03:14.274 --> 01:03:17.278
- To the office. I've got work to do.
- But you mustn't go.

01:03:17.402 --> 01:03:21.157
I was sent over here at great expense
as a newspaperman, not a refugee.

01:03:21.281 --> 01:03:23.909
- How about lunch at the Savoy?
- I'll see you out.

01:03:25.911 --> 01:03:28.130
Johnny, please be careful.

01:03:28.288 --> 01:03:29.881
I'll be all right.

01:03:33.835 --> 01:03:35.758
<i>Mr. Haverstock?</i>

01:03:35.879 --> 01:03:39.099
Is this the man?
Look, who's protecting who?

01:03:39.216 --> 01:03:41.594
Well, I ain't lanky, sir,
but I'm quick.

01:03:41.718 --> 01:03:43.846
I take it you understand
what to do.

01:03:43.970 --> 01:03:47.850
You can trust me to take care of
Mr. Haverstock. Are we going now, sir?

01:03:47.974 --> 01:03:51.103
Yes, you can take me to my office,
and if you're good...

01:03:51.228 --> 01:03:53.606
- to the American Club.
- Right, sir.

01:03:53.730 --> 01:03:55.583
<i>You'll keep after
this other thing?</i>

01:03:55.609 --> 01:03:57.851
<i>As soon as there's news,
I'll let you know.</i>

01:03:57.943 --> 01:03:59.741
Then you can break the story.
Good-bye.

01:03:59.861 --> 01:04:01.329
Good-bye, sir.

01:04:06.826 --> 01:04:08.578
Why, Carol.

01:04:08.703 --> 01:04:11.673
Nothing must happen to him, Father.
I just couldn't...

01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:19.422
How do we go, sir?

01:04:19.547 --> 01:04:23.097
Would you like me to walk behind you,
or beside you, like a friend?

01:04:23.218 --> 01:04:26.097
- What's the custom?
- Different people has different tastes.

01:04:26.221 --> 01:04:29.316
With the Duke of Albatrorr,
the duke, being a democratic gent...

01:04:29.432 --> 01:04:32.026
I used to walk alongside of him,
man-to-man, like.

01:04:32.143 --> 01:04:35.647
On the other hand, I once had a lady
who thought that was disrespectful.

01:04:35.772 --> 01:04:38.195
"Three paces behind," she says,
"and don't smoke on duty."

01:04:38.358 --> 01:04:40.902
What's good enough for a
duke is good enough for me.

01:04:40.928 --> 01:04:41.887
Thank you, sir.

01:04:42.028 --> 01:04:47.000
If we want to go to the American Club,
we'd better take a cab. There's one.

01:04:47.117 --> 01:04:49.461
What's the trouble, sir.
Is it gangsters after you?

01:04:49.577 --> 01:04:50.228
Not exactly.

01:04:50.254 --> 01:04:52.856
We're not afraid of
gangsters over here, sir.

01:04:52.956 --> 01:04:55.880
- Even our police don't carry guns.
- What do they do?

01:04:56.001 --> 01:05:00.051
Hit you over the head with a stick.
A bit more healthy-like.

01:05:06.011 --> 01:05:08.605
Did you see that?
Someone deliberately pushed me!

01:05:08.722 --> 01:05:12.226
That was me, sir. If I'd have pulled
you back, you'd have been caught.

01:05:12.392 --> 01:05:13.604
It was push or nothing.

01:05:13.630 --> 01:05:16.263
Smart work, Mr. Rowley.
Thank you very much.

01:05:16.396 --> 01:05:19.400
After all, that's what I'm here for,
isn't it? Taxi!

01:05:24.154 --> 01:05:26.248
- American Club.
- Yes, sir.

01:05:26.364 --> 01:05:28.082
After you, sir.

01:05:36.875 --> 01:05:39.173
I'm not certain, sir,
but I've got an idea...

01:05:39.294 --> 01:05:42.423
two men just got
in another cab to follow us.

01:05:42.547 --> 01:05:44.424
I don't see
anyone suspicious.

01:05:44.549 --> 01:05:46.597
Well, I may have
been mistaken...

01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:49.138
but I'm almost certain
I saw them.

01:05:52.307 --> 01:05:54.309
They may have heard
where we're going.

01:05:55.518 --> 01:05:57.612
Driver.

01:05:57.729 --> 01:06:00.198
Driver?
Go down Victoria Street...

01:06:00.315 --> 01:06:02.158
'round past
Buckingham Palace.

01:06:02.275 --> 01:06:03.618
Right, sir.

01:06:03.735 --> 01:06:07.035
We might give 'em the slip
if we go the long way around.

01:06:10.617 --> 01:06:12.415
I'm afraid
they're still after us.

01:06:12.535 --> 01:06:16.039
Our best plan is to pull 'round
the next corner and change cabs.

01:06:16.164 --> 01:06:19.259
Driver? Take the first
to your left and pull up.

01:06:19.376 --> 01:06:21.470
We're going to walk a bit.

01:06:27.926 --> 01:06:31.226
I'll do it, sir. I understand
the money. It'll be quicker.

01:06:31.346 --> 01:06:33.974
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

01:06:35.308 --> 01:06:38.312
Our best plan is to slip
into the cathedral for a bit.

01:06:38.436 --> 01:06:42.441
Let's call off this ducking and let them
catch up with us and have a showdown.

01:06:42.565 --> 01:06:45.858
I wouldn't cause a scene.
Our job is to give 'em the slip.

01:06:45.884 --> 01:06:46.720
All right.

01:06:46.820 --> 01:06:50.575
- Let's go.
- Nice bit of architecture, sir, innit?

01:07:15.181 --> 01:07:18.355
Do you mind not going right in, sir?

01:07:18.476 --> 01:07:22.231
I saw by the notice it was
a requiem mass... a mass for the dead.

01:07:22.355 --> 01:07:26.201
<i>That sort of thing always depresses me
...praying for the dead and all that.</i>

01:07:26.317 --> 01:07:28.661
The dead are all right
in their place, sir...

01:07:28.778 --> 01:07:31.782
but the music and the candles
always gives me the creeps.

01:07:31.906 --> 01:07:35.035
It does really, sir.
I don't like to be so fussy...

01:07:39.456 --> 01:07:41.424
How about a trip up top, sir?

01:07:41.541 --> 01:07:44.010
That'd really put 'em
off the scent.

01:08:00.977 --> 01:08:02.854
Boys, careful there.

01:08:15.909 --> 01:08:19.334
- I can't see.
- Eh? Here, here.

01:08:19.453 --> 01:08:22.377
There you are, me boy.

01:08:22.499 --> 01:08:24.251
<i>Ooh!</i>

01:08:24.417 --> 01:08:26.260
<i>Look, there it goes. There.</i>

01:08:26.377 --> 01:08:28.595
I'll have to buy you
another now.

01:08:28.712 --> 01:08:30.636
Love a duck!

01:08:30.756 --> 01:08:33.180
Careful, boys.

01:08:33.301 --> 01:08:35.429
You better be careful too, sir.

01:08:40.892 --> 01:08:42.484
Not yet, boys.

01:08:45.229 --> 01:08:49.861
Let's get out of here. I have a luncheon
date and plenty to do before it.

01:08:49.984 --> 01:08:53.453
I've got it in mind, sir.
Don't you worry. Really, now, look.

01:08:53.571 --> 01:08:56.120
Isn't it worthwhile
coming up here to see it, sir?

01:08:56.241 --> 01:08:58.288
There's the houses
of Parliament over there.

01:08:58.408 --> 01:09:01.709
And there's St. James's Park.
That green patch. Yeah.

01:09:01.828 --> 01:09:03.581
Come along, boys.

01:09:09.962 --> 01:09:13.684
You must excuse me getting so scared
when you leaned over just now, sir.

01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:16.644
I was once with a man
on a bridge in Switzerland.

01:09:16.803 --> 01:09:18.897
He had a very nasty fall.

01:09:20.139 --> 01:09:23.063
Killed him. Stone dead.

01:09:24.644 --> 01:09:26.863
Always made me
a bit nervous since.

01:09:42.495 --> 01:09:46.170
Don't go down just yet, sir.
I'd like you to see St. Paul's.

01:09:46.332 --> 01:09:48.710
There it is,
just coming out of the mist.

01:09:48.835 --> 01:09:52.055
Oh, and look. There's the 'orse guards
approaching Buckingham Palace.

01:09:52.171 --> 01:09:55.675
- See 'em? Down there.
- It makes the backs of me legs go funny.

01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:58.394
<i>Height always did.
Let's get down again, Eric.</i>

01:09:58.511 --> 01:10:00.309
<i>Why didn't you say so before?</i>

01:10:00.430 --> 01:10:02.353
Miss,
I know just how you feel.

01:10:02.515 --> 01:10:04.776
Them as has no head for
heights can't help it.

01:10:04.802 --> 01:10:06.340
Nobody ought not
to blame them.

01:10:06.436 --> 01:10:09.690
- What's it got to do with you?
- All right, keep your head on.

01:10:09.856 --> 01:10:12.279
- I was only sympathizing.
- I'm going down anyway.

01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:14.448
- Wait for the lift.
- No.

01:10:20.199 --> 01:10:22.497
No stairs for me.
I'm gonna take the elevator.

01:10:22.619 --> 01:10:24.246
Wait a minute, sir.

01:10:24.370 --> 01:10:28.216
<i>You ain't seen
the 'orse guards yet.</i>

01:10:28.333 --> 01:10:30.586
You must see
the 'orse guards, sir.

01:10:31.878 --> 01:10:33.972
Where?
I don't see anything.

01:10:34.088 --> 01:10:36.307
Why, there they are, sir.

01:10:36.424 --> 01:10:38.392
Down the road.

01:10:38.551 --> 01:10:41.475
Just going toward the...

01:10:41.596 --> 01:10:43.394
the white building.

01:10:55.735 --> 01:10:57.578
No, boys. This way.

01:11:18.132 --> 01:11:20.430
Well, there but for
the grace of God.

01:11:20.593 --> 01:11:24.590
I still don't know what instinct made
me step aside when he came at me.

01:11:24.616 --> 01:11:25.670
You need a drink.

01:11:25.765 --> 01:11:28.439
I heard the lift coming up,
and I turned.

01:11:28.601 --> 01:11:31.605
I saw that look in his eye
as he came toward me.

01:11:31.771 --> 01:11:34.695
In that split second, the whole thing
flashed through my mind.

01:11:34.816 --> 01:11:37.114
All I could think of was Fisher.

01:11:37.235 --> 01:11:39.784
"Fisher planned this."

01:11:39.904 --> 01:11:42.657
Then I guess I just stepped aside,
and over he went.

01:11:42.782 --> 01:11:45.126
Over he went, all right.
Did you want this?

01:11:45.243 --> 01:11:46.711
No, thanks.

01:11:46.828 --> 01:11:50.253
When are you going to send the story
to our esteemed gazette?

01:11:50.373 --> 01:11:52.421
When I get ready.

01:11:52.542 --> 01:11:54.590
Well, there goes another
of my illusions.

01:11:54.711 --> 01:11:57.760
I thought you were one of those
journalists nothing could stop.

01:11:57.880 --> 01:12:00.884
Floods, smallpox, love...
the story must go on.

01:12:01.008 --> 01:12:03.602
It'll go on.

01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:07.850
No. I can understand you not wanting
to drag Miss Fisher into it.

01:12:07.974 --> 01:12:10.318
On the other hand,
she's probably in it already.

01:12:10.476 --> 01:12:12.478
- The moll of the gang.
- Why, you dirty...

01:12:12.603 --> 01:12:15.698
On second thought, I'm sure not.
I'm sure she's a fine girl...

01:12:15.815 --> 01:12:17.658
upstanding, honest,
with a great soul.

01:12:17.817 --> 01:12:20.661
I can't send the story
on Van Meer until he's safe.

01:12:20.778 --> 01:12:23.327
We've got to find Van Meer first.

01:12:23.448 --> 01:12:26.543
Ah, there's our man now, probably.
Mr. Van Meer, come in.

01:12:28.035 --> 01:12:30.538
Good morning, Stebbins.
How are you, Haverstock?

01:12:30.663 --> 01:12:33.337
Congratulations on your little
set-to with Rowley.

01:12:35.376 --> 01:12:37.504
What do you know
about Rowley?

01:12:37.628 --> 01:12:40.256
Very little ffolliott doesn't hear.
He probably even knows about Fisher.

01:12:40.381 --> 01:12:42.179
I was onto Fisher
a year ago...

01:12:42.341 --> 01:12:44.343
but that fellow
with the high-neck sweater...

01:12:44.469 --> 01:12:46.847
- Krug... he's new to me...
- You're onto him too?

01:12:47.013 --> 01:12:49.857
- Followed him to London.
- I thought you were cold on this story.

01:12:49.974 --> 01:12:52.523
On the contrary.
I've been doing a bit of noticing.

01:12:52.643 --> 01:12:55.237
- Remember that tramp asleep in the mill?
- Yeah.

01:12:55.354 --> 01:12:58.528
- He wasn't a tramp at all.
- Van Meer, I suppose.

01:12:58.649 --> 01:13:02.324
Not quite, but I noticed him
do a strange thing for a tramp.

01:13:02.445 --> 01:13:05.289
He dirtied his hands
with some of that nasty Dutch soil.

01:13:05.406 --> 01:13:08.250
I can't follow the workings
of these masterminds.

01:13:11.078 --> 01:13:13.376
No.
Tell him it's ridiculous.

01:13:15.208 --> 01:13:17.176
You'd already disappeared,
so I followed Krug...

01:13:17.293 --> 01:13:19.295
but ended up
at the same old mousetrap.

01:13:19.420 --> 01:13:20.842
You mean Fisher?

01:13:20.963 --> 01:13:24.092
The good, kind, genial head
of the Peace Party, Herr Fisher.

01:13:26.594 --> 01:13:28.892
Hello, Eddie?
This is Plunger Stebbins.

01:13:29.013 --> 01:13:31.983
I want to place a bet
on Flibbertigibbet in the first...

01:13:32.099 --> 01:13:36.195
The race is over? What do you know
about that? Okay, I'll call you later.

01:13:36.312 --> 01:13:39.065
Any objection to working
the rest of this thing together?

01:13:39.232 --> 01:13:41.735
Catch Fisher, find Van Meer,
that sort of thing?

01:13:41.859 --> 01:13:45.113
All right, but I'd like to know
why they kidnapped Van Meer.

01:13:45.238 --> 01:13:47.741
He was one of the signatories
to a certain treaty.

01:13:47.907 --> 01:13:49.955
The most important clause
was never written down...

01:13:50.076 --> 01:13:52.249
just memorized
by the two people who signed.

01:13:52.370 --> 01:13:54.088
They're gonna
beat it out of him?

01:13:54.247 --> 01:13:57.592
They're going to try. It'd be
a good idea if we put a stop to them.

01:13:57.750 --> 01:14:00.253
It contains information
that would be valuable to the enemy...

01:14:00.419 --> 01:14:02.888
in the war that breaks out tomorrow,
weather permitting.

01:14:03.005 --> 01:14:05.383
What? Why didn't someone
let me in on this?

01:14:05.508 --> 01:14:08.432
- Stebbins, we've got to get busy.
- Plenty of time. Lunch first.

01:14:08.553 --> 01:14:10.851
You mind waiting?
You might be of some help.

01:14:10.972 --> 01:14:13.566
I thought up a little plan
for forcing Fisher's hand.

01:14:13.683 --> 01:14:15.310
Let's have it.

01:14:15.434 --> 01:14:19.029
I think the neatest thing would be
to kidnap Fisher's daughter.

01:14:20.106 --> 01:14:20.841
Oh, yeah?

01:14:20.867 --> 01:14:23.806
One of Fisher's few genuine traits
is his affection for Miss Fisher.

01:14:23.943 --> 01:14:26.116
<i>Easy. You're speaking
to the man who loves her.</i>

01:14:26.237 --> 01:14:28.786
All the better. Give you
a chance to get chummy...

01:14:28.906 --> 01:14:32.501
and keep her out of this mess
while we batter away at papa.

01:14:32.618 --> 01:14:35.167
This is my scheme:
I walk in, let Fisher know...

01:14:35.288 --> 01:14:37.791
his daughter's in the hands
of someone who means business...

01:14:37.957 --> 01:14:41.461
just as he means business when he
kidnaps people. He'll see things our way.

01:14:41.586 --> 01:14:43.666
- Nothing doing.
- I thought you were a newspaperman.

01:14:43.713 --> 01:14:46.216
That doesn't include kidnapping
your fiancee where I come from.

01:14:46.340 --> 01:14:49.389
- It would if your country were at stake.
- This isn't my country.

01:14:49.510 --> 01:14:52.480
It's your story. Don't be gloomy.
She doesn't have to know.

01:14:52.597 --> 01:14:55.817
- Just keep her amused.
- Why not grab Fisher and have a showdown?

01:14:55.933 --> 01:14:59.654
No good. We've got nothing
on Fisher. He'd slip out of it anyway.

01:14:59.770 --> 01:15:02.444
All we'd do would be
to kill Van Meer.

01:15:02.565 --> 01:15:04.442
<i>Mm.</i>

01:15:04.567 --> 01:15:08.242
Hello, darling. Are you all right?
What were you doing on the tower?

01:15:08.362 --> 01:15:11.240
Trying to keep out of harm's way,
but those assassins followed.

01:15:11.266 --> 01:15:13.018
There was a scuffle,
and over he went.

01:15:13.117 --> 01:15:15.415
Darling, they won't stop
till they get you.

01:15:15.536 --> 01:15:17.755
You must leave London
immediately.

01:15:20.499 --> 01:15:23.469
The one thing everybody
forgets is I'm a reporter.

01:15:23.586 --> 01:15:25.384
There's a war.
I can't run out.

01:15:25.504 --> 01:15:29.008
Scott, he can't stay here.
Tell him how desperate these men are.

01:15:29.133 --> 01:15:31.227
He shouldn't stay another minute.
Take him somewhere.

01:15:31.344 --> 01:15:32.063
I won't go.

01:15:32.089 --> 01:15:34.964
Couldn't you think up some aunt
in the country or something?

01:15:35.056 --> 01:15:37.900
There's my Aunt Margaret at Harpenden.
Let me take you there.

01:15:38.017 --> 01:15:40.019
- How about it?
- Stay out of this.

01:15:40.186 --> 01:15:42.314
It's the only
sensible thing to do.

01:15:42.438 --> 01:15:44.611
May I use your telephone?

01:15:51.781 --> 01:15:54.125
Hello, Stiles?
Miss Carol speaking.

01:15:54.241 --> 01:15:57.541
Tell Mr. Fisher I'm driving down
to Aunt Margaret's at Harpenden.

01:15:57.662 --> 01:16:00.506
- I won't go.
<i>- I'll be back in time for dinner.</i>

01:16:00.623 --> 01:16:02.250
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:16:02.375 --> 01:16:04.374
it's settled. We can
get you a toothbrush...

01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:05.199
It's no good.

01:16:05.294 --> 01:16:08.138
I'm wondering whether this idea
of your aunt is so good.

01:16:08.255 --> 01:16:10.257
Maybe it'd be better further out...
say, Cambridge.

01:16:10.383 --> 01:16:12.207
There's no place as
obscure as Harpenden.

01:16:12.233 --> 01:16:13.708
It isn't so
much the place...

01:16:13.803 --> 01:16:16.147
as the fact Krug
might connect you with it.

01:16:16.263 --> 01:16:17.607
You're right.
Make it Cambridge.

01:16:17.633 --> 01:16:19.588
I'll phone your father
so he doesn't worry.

01:16:19.684 --> 01:16:22.563
Thank you, Scott.
Please, Johnny?

01:16:33.698 --> 01:16:36.918
That was a break, her suggesting
they go to the country.

01:16:37.034 --> 01:16:40.038
As a matter of fact, old boy,
I suggested it to her...

01:16:40.162 --> 01:16:42.210
on the phone
about half an hour ago.

01:16:51.090 --> 01:16:54.515
There hasn't been a sign
of anybody for the last 30 miles.

01:16:55.553 --> 01:16:57.897
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

01:16:58.014 --> 01:17:01.894
You might at least talk to me.
It's unfair to sit there and pout...

01:17:02.018 --> 01:17:04.771
because I've kidnapped you
from your so-called duties.

01:17:04.895 --> 01:17:06.772
- You've kidnapped me?
- Mm-hmm.

01:17:06.939 --> 01:17:09.442
- Just remember that, will you?
- Please forgive me.

01:17:09.608 --> 01:17:11.736
Why, sure.
I don't think kidnapping's...

01:17:11.861 --> 01:17:15.411
anything to get sore about when done
by the right kidnapper, do you?

01:17:15.531 --> 01:17:17.249
- Not at all.
- Thanks.

01:17:24.623 --> 01:17:26.170
Hello?

01:17:27.585 --> 01:17:30.964
No, Mr. ffolliott.
I'm afraid he's not in yet.

01:17:31.088 --> 01:17:32.635
Very well, sir.

01:17:44.602 --> 01:17:46.980
- Johnny, you don't love me.
- You're crazy.

01:17:47.146 --> 01:17:50.696
- You looked unhappy when you kissed me.
- Never happier in my life.

01:17:50.816 --> 01:17:52.989
Won't do.
Johnny, what's happened?

01:17:53.110 --> 01:17:55.704
The war, I guess.
They say it's coming tomorrow.

01:17:55.821 --> 01:17:58.574
So you've changed
your philosophy since yesterday.

01:17:58.699 --> 01:18:01.248
There are more important things
in the world than love.

01:18:01.368 --> 01:18:03.791
- I've got lots to do. Important things.
- Carol...

01:18:03.913 --> 01:18:06.666
Got to get started.
It'll take three hours to get back.

01:18:06.791 --> 01:18:10.011
I'm not going to be misunderstood.
I'm so in love, I'm going mad.

01:18:10.127 --> 01:18:12.505
Won't do.
I suppose it can't be helped.

01:18:12.671 --> 01:18:14.924
You've turned European
on me overnight, Johnny.

01:18:15.049 --> 01:18:19.520
That's unfair. I'm just as big
a jackass as I ever was. Bigger.

01:18:19.637 --> 01:18:22.015
You're not going back
to London to dinner tonight.

01:18:22.181 --> 01:18:24.809
You can't run out
on your kidnapper like that.

01:18:24.934 --> 01:18:27.653
I mean...
Well, you know what I mean.

01:18:27.770 --> 01:18:30.319
If you run out on me now,
I'm going...

01:18:30.439 --> 01:18:32.658
straight to London
and let them bump me off.

01:18:32.775 --> 01:18:34.493
Be a relief at that.

01:18:34.610 --> 01:18:37.989
Well, you are moody.
Am I the cause?

01:18:40.616 --> 01:18:44.211
If you knew how much
I loved you, you'd faint.

01:18:52.086 --> 01:18:54.214
There.
What'd I tell you?

01:18:54.380 --> 01:18:57.054
<i>Come in.</i>

01:18:57.174 --> 01:18:58.801
- Mr. Haverstock?
- Yes?

01:18:58.926 --> 01:19:01.054
- Call from London.
- Have them switch it up.

01:19:01.220 --> 01:19:03.348
Sorry, there's only one phone...
in the office.

01:19:03.472 --> 01:19:05.895
All right, I'll come down.

01:19:06.058 --> 01:19:08.356
Forgive me
for a moment, dear.

01:19:14.316 --> 01:19:16.410
Just a moment, sir.

01:19:23.075 --> 01:19:24.418
Hello?

01:19:24.535 --> 01:19:28.210
Is that you, Haverstock, old boy?
Are you alone? Can you talk?

01:19:28.330 --> 01:19:32.130
I can't get a hold of Fisher.
He's been out all afternoon.

01:19:32.251 --> 01:19:35.596
I'm afraid you'll have to keep the girl
much longer than we'd planned.

01:19:35.754 --> 01:19:39.099
I don't know what time he'll be back.
I've got to catch him alone.

01:19:39.216 --> 01:19:40.889
Keep the girl there
for the night.

01:19:41.010 --> 01:19:43.263
But that's
absolutely impossible.

01:19:43.387 --> 01:19:45.890
We can't let
this thing go now.

01:19:47.099 --> 01:19:50.979
I can't very well explain, but I simply
couldn't pull a thing like that.

01:19:51.103 --> 01:19:55.358
You've got to try. There isn't anything
else to be done. I'm counting on you.

01:19:55.482 --> 01:19:56.950
Hello?

01:19:58.611 --> 01:20:00.033
Hello?

01:20:10.289 --> 01:20:12.462
Are you quite satisfied
with your room, sir?

01:20:12.625 --> 01:20:15.674
Well, not exactly.
That is, I mean, yes...

01:20:15.794 --> 01:20:18.217
but I really wanted
another room as well...

01:20:18.339 --> 01:20:20.182
a single room.

01:20:20.299 --> 01:20:22.768
Oh. Mr. Naismith?

01:20:22.885 --> 01:20:25.479
<i>Mr. Naismith, this gentleman
wants another room.</i>

01:20:25.638 --> 01:20:29.017
<i>For the young lady?
How long will you be requiring it?</i>

01:20:29.141 --> 01:20:32.065
<i>She'll only be here
just the one might.</i>

01:20:34.772 --> 01:20:37.491
- The gentleman has number 7, sir.
- What about number 8?

01:20:37.608 --> 01:20:39.997
It doesn't really make
any difference, so long

01:20:40.023 --> 01:20:42.309
as it's a good room...
windows and all that.

01:20:42.404 --> 01:20:44.156
I quite understand, sir.

01:20:44.281 --> 01:20:47.080
I think perhaps the room
next to yours would be best.

01:20:47.201 --> 01:20:50.375
It's quite cozy, isn't it,
Miss Pollitt? Number 8?

01:20:50.496 --> 01:20:53.500
<i>- They're all very much alike to me, sir.
- Eight'll do.</i>

01:20:53.666 --> 01:20:56.419
Will you bring the young lady
and sign the book, please?

01:20:56.543 --> 01:20:59.046
Yes, I'll... I'll get her.

01:21:18.190 --> 01:21:20.363
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening, Stiles.

01:21:26.115 --> 01:21:29.540
Terrible thing, sir, that poor man
who was here this morning.

01:21:29.702 --> 01:21:32.125
Yes, terrible, Stiles.
My bags all packed?

01:21:32.246 --> 01:21:34.340
- Yes, sir.
- And Miss Carol's?

01:21:34.456 --> 01:21:37.801
Mrs. Stiles packed hers too.
She hopes she's put in the right things.

01:21:37.918 --> 01:21:40.967
It's been such a rush, especially
with Miss Carol not back yet.

01:21:41.088 --> 01:21:43.807
Mr. ffolliott's here now.
He's waiting in the sitting room.

01:21:43.924 --> 01:21:46.268
Another gentleman just phoned.
He wouldn't leave his name.

01:21:46.385 --> 01:21:48.173
I thought I recognized
his voice as the

01:21:48.199 --> 01:21:50.210
foreign gentleman who
was here at breakfast.

01:21:50.306 --> 01:21:53.435
- Did he say he'd telephone again?
- Yes, he said it was urgent.

01:21:53.559 --> 01:21:55.903
Well, show Mr. ffolliott
into the study.

01:22:13.412 --> 01:22:14.013
Hello, sir.

01:22:14.039 --> 01:22:16.441
Scott, you caught me
at a very busy moment.

01:22:16.540 --> 01:22:18.588
I'm getting ready to go
to America tomorrow.

01:22:18.709 --> 01:22:20.586
Are you taking
Carol with you?

01:22:20.753 --> 01:22:24.678
Yes. She doesn't know yet. It's been
such a rush. I'm waiting for her now.

01:22:24.798 --> 01:22:28.098
What's your worry? Must be important,
by the number of times you telephoned.

01:22:28.260 --> 01:22:30.058
Yes, it is, sir.
It's about Carol.

01:22:30.179 --> 01:22:33.433
- I'm afraid that...
- What? Anything happen to her?

01:22:33.557 --> 01:22:36.276
I don't think you'll be able
to take her to America.

01:22:36.393 --> 01:22:38.566
What do you mean?
Why not?

01:22:39.938 --> 01:22:42.942
It'll sound rather silly to you,
but Carol has been kidnapped.

01:22:43.067 --> 01:22:45.820
- Is this a joke of some sort?
- No, sir.

01:22:46.820 --> 01:22:48.618
What do you mean, "kidnapped"?

01:22:48.781 --> 01:22:51.330
I happen to know
she's with her aunt in Harpenden.

01:22:51.450 --> 01:22:53.327
I'm afraid she isn't.

01:23:04.671 --> 01:23:08.642
Stiles, who gave you the message that Miss
Carol had gone to her Aunt Margaret's?

01:23:08.759 --> 01:23:11.478
Miss Carol herself, sir.

01:23:11.595 --> 01:23:14.394
- Thank you, Stiles.
- That's where she thought she was going.

01:23:24.775 --> 01:23:27.244
Get me Harpenden 43422.

01:23:29.988 --> 01:23:32.161
Hello, is that you, Margaret?

01:23:32.324 --> 01:23:33.997
Is Carol with you?

01:23:37.246 --> 01:23:39.169
<i>No. No, I...</i>

01:23:39.331 --> 01:23:42.551
<i>I wasn't' certain. She said
she might run down to see you.</i>

01:23:42.668 --> 01:23:46.093
I didn't know whether
to expect her back for dinner.

01:23:46.213 --> 01:23:48.466
Right. Good night, Margaret.

01:23:50.884 --> 01:23:52.807
No, she isn't there.

01:23:53.846 --> 01:23:55.848
What makes you say
she's been kidnapped?

01:23:58.517 --> 01:24:01.487
Well, sir... I arranged it.

01:24:05.023 --> 01:24:07.276
This has gone far enough.
Where is Carol?

01:24:08.610 --> 01:24:11.409
Carol's being held
as a sort of hostage...

01:24:11.530 --> 01:24:15.501
by some people who are very much
in earnest... as much as you are.

01:24:15.617 --> 01:24:19.542
Don't be so cryptic. I haven't the
faintest idea what you're talking about.

01:24:22.374 --> 01:24:24.672
I want to know
where you're hiding Van Meer.

01:24:29.006 --> 01:24:32.556
So that's it.
You've been talking with Haverstock.

01:24:32.676 --> 01:24:35.930
He was here this morning telling us
about Van Meer still being alive.

01:24:36.054 --> 01:24:38.225
You promised Haverstock you'd
look into it, didn't you?

01:24:38.251 --> 01:24:38.832
Naturally.

01:24:38.932 --> 01:24:42.937
An unusual way of looking into it,
trying to have him put out of the way.

01:24:43.061 --> 01:24:46.611
I realize a life or two is a small
matter, the way you work.

01:24:46.732 --> 01:24:50.703
Well, the people who have got Carol
can take a leaf out of your book.

01:24:52.571 --> 01:24:54.869
Where is she?
What have you done with her?

01:24:54.990 --> 01:24:57.539
Where's Van Meer?

01:25:05.209 --> 01:25:06.586
Hello?

01:25:06.710 --> 01:25:10.431
I think I can get our Dutch friend
to talk if you come along.

01:25:10.589 --> 01:25:14.093
Sorry to drag you here like this,
but I think it's the only way...

01:25:14.218 --> 01:25:16.220
if you want to leave tomorrow.

01:25:16.345 --> 01:25:19.224
When you get here,
ask at the cashier's desk...

01:25:19.348 --> 01:25:21.021
to use the phone.

01:25:21.141 --> 01:25:23.269
They'll show you straight up.

01:25:24.436 --> 01:25:27.610
Very well.
I'll drop in as soon as I can.

01:25:27.731 --> 01:25:30.735
If you want Carol, you'd better
tell me where Van Meer is.

01:25:30.859 --> 01:25:32.721
Bring her back. I'll
give you the address.

01:25:32.747 --> 01:25:34.479
Carol can be home
in three hours...

01:25:34.571 --> 01:25:36.289
<i>but I want that address now.</i>

01:25:36.448 --> 01:25:38.701
You'll have it as soon
as Carol is home.

01:25:38.825 --> 01:25:41.044
I can't possibly
wait three hours.

01:25:41.161 --> 01:25:44.085
Besides, I happen
to want Van Meer alive.

01:26:14.069 --> 01:26:16.117
Well, Scott,
I delivered him, all right.

01:26:16.238 --> 01:26:17.911
Good.

01:26:18.031 --> 01:26:22.002
I'll be getting along now. Thanks very
much for those points for my leader.

01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:24.913
Can I take them now?
Good night, Carol. Good night, sir.

01:26:25.038 --> 01:26:26.665
<i>Good night.</i>

01:26:31.461 --> 01:26:33.338
I beg your pardon, sir.

01:26:47.477 --> 01:26:51.402
This isn't like you.
What is it that's upset you so?

01:26:51.523 --> 01:26:55.198
I know I'm being silly.
I'm behaving perfectly stupidly.

01:26:55.319 --> 01:26:57.822
Please forgive me.

01:26:57.946 --> 01:26:59.994
I wouldn't mind so much...

01:27:00.115 --> 01:27:02.618
but I didn't think
he was that sort of person.

01:27:04.620 --> 01:27:07.715
Something to do
with young Haverstock?

01:27:07.873 --> 01:27:09.875
<i>You like him very much,
don't you?</i>

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:11.287
After what happened today...

01:27:11.313 --> 01:27:14.531
I drove him down to the country to
get him away from those people...

01:27:14.630 --> 01:27:17.474
I thought you were going
to Aunt Margaret's.

01:27:17.591 --> 01:27:19.639
<i>We were, but Scott ffolliott...</i>

01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:22.855
<i>thought it would be better
to go further away.</i>

01:27:22.971 --> 01:27:25.019
<i>So...</i>

01:27:25.140 --> 01:27:28.861
I thought the College Arms
at Cambridge would be a good place.

01:27:28.977 --> 01:27:31.571
When we got there,
I found out he wanted...

01:27:32.773 --> 01:27:35.242
You see,
we'd been joking about it...

01:27:35.359 --> 01:27:38.863
but when I heard him book
the extra room, I knew he meant it.

01:27:40.197 --> 01:27:43.622
<i>Such a cheap trick.
That's what hurts." It was so cheap.</i>

01:27:43.742 --> 01:27:46.461
It wasn't at all
like I thought he was.

01:27:47.913 --> 01:27:51.463
What difference does it make?
I don't care if I ever see him again.

01:27:51.583 --> 01:27:54.462
You won't have to. We're going
to America tomorrow by clipper.

01:27:54.586 --> 01:27:57.214
Tomorrow?
Oh, but I can't.

01:27:57.339 --> 01:28:01.264
Well... I suppose I can,
but why tomorrow?

01:28:01.385 --> 01:28:03.854
It's our last chance. War will
probably be declared tomorrow.

01:28:03.970 --> 01:28:08.100
I have to get to Washington. The boats will
be crowded. We're liable to wait weeks.

01:28:08.225 --> 01:28:11.855
- But what about Mr. Van Meer?
- We've done all we could.

01:28:11.978 --> 01:28:14.606
I was at the foreign office
with Ainsworth this afternoon.

01:28:14.731 --> 01:28:16.404
They're taking
the whole thing over.

01:28:16.525 --> 01:28:18.118
Stiles, what is it?

01:28:18.235 --> 01:28:20.574
The blackout, sir. I
have to draw the blinds.

01:28:20.600 --> 01:28:21.514
Oh, I forgot.

01:28:21.613 --> 01:28:24.287
Before you do that,
order me a taxi, will you?

01:28:24.313 --> 01:28:25.108
Yes, sir.

01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:27.453
I've got people I must see
before we leave.

01:28:27.619 --> 01:28:30.623
I'll try not to be long.
Mrs. Stiles has done your packing.

01:28:30.747 --> 01:28:33.500
I thought we might go to Southampton,
stay at the Southwestern.

01:28:33.625 --> 01:28:35.923
Stiles, and my hat, please.
Good-bye, darling.

01:28:36.044 --> 01:28:40.470
In the meantime, you and Stiles might be
loading the car so as not to lose time.

01:28:40.590 --> 01:28:42.513
- You'd better eat.
- What about you?

01:28:42.634 --> 01:28:44.477
I'll get a sandwich later.

01:28:53.186 --> 01:28:54.938
242 Charlotte Street...

01:28:55.063 --> 01:28:57.111
halfway up
Tottenham Court Road.

01:29:05.699 --> 01:29:08.578
Wait here until Haverstock turns up.
He's bound to come here.

01:29:08.702 --> 01:29:11.501
Bring him along
to 242 Charlotte Street...

01:29:11.621 --> 01:29:13.965
off Tottenham Court Road.

01:29:23.508 --> 01:29:25.852
- Hello?
- Hello. Hello?

01:29:25.969 --> 01:29:29.348
<i>Hello.</i>

01:30:00.670 --> 01:30:03.423
Be careful.

01:30:14.184 --> 01:30:16.983
Might I use your telephone?

01:30:17.103 --> 01:30:18.730
This way, sir.

01:30:38.959 --> 01:30:39.760
Where is he?

01:30:39.786 --> 01:30:42.989
In there. We can't make him
say anything. It's up to you.

01:30:43.088 --> 01:30:45.637
Let's get it over.
Is this place safe?

01:30:45.757 --> 01:30:48.306
There'll be no interruption.
We closed it for decoration.

01:30:48.426 --> 01:30:50.975
- Those people downstairs?
- They won't make any trouble.

01:30:51.096 --> 01:30:54.817
They know what will happen to their
relatives in the homeland if they do.

01:31:12.701 --> 01:31:14.453
<i>♪♪ [ Ends I</i>

01:31:21.626 --> 01:31:24.926
<i>Not a very attractive nest,
and the music a little vulgar...</i>

01:31:25.046 --> 01:31:26.389
<i>but if serves its purpose.</i>

01:31:26.506 --> 01:31:27.974
Yes.

01:31:47.027 --> 01:31:48.745
Pardon me.

01:31:53.491 --> 01:31:55.334
Put your arm around him...

01:31:55.452 --> 01:31:57.204
and hold his head forward.

01:31:59.956 --> 01:32:01.924
These lights...
can't you cut them down?

01:32:09.341 --> 01:32:11.014
I thank you.

01:32:12.260 --> 01:32:14.638
Oh, I thank you very much.

01:32:18.350 --> 01:32:21.524
You're like my friend,
Mr. Fisher.

01:32:21.645 --> 01:32:23.238
I'm sorry.

01:32:23.355 --> 01:32:25.357
It's just so dark.

01:32:27.901 --> 01:32:29.869
I cannot tell, but...

01:32:31.863 --> 01:32:35.208
but you are
so like my friend.

01:32:35.367 --> 01:32:38.120
I am Fisher, Mr. Van Meer.
I am your friend.

01:32:38.244 --> 01:32:39.496
Oh!

01:32:39.621 --> 01:32:42.090
I am so glad.

01:32:42.207 --> 01:32:45.507
Mr. Fisher,
are the police here?

01:32:45.627 --> 01:32:48.221
Oh, they mustn't get away.

01:32:48.338 --> 01:32:51.717
You mustn't let
these people go.

01:32:54.135 --> 01:32:58.060
I represent the Jupiter Life Assurance.
Could I interest you in a small policy?

01:33:04.354 --> 01:33:07.403
<i>- Why did you bring him up?</i>
- I didn't know what to do.

01:33:07.524 --> 01:33:09.284
I'd relieve the lady
of this embarrassment...

01:33:09.401 --> 01:33:11.403
but you know
how women are with firearms.

01:33:11.569 --> 01:33:13.571
No sense of timing.
I'll just sit here.

01:33:13.697 --> 01:33:15.745
You carry on
with whatever you were doing.

01:33:15.865 --> 01:33:18.414
Don't mind me.
I sometimes sit like this for hours.

01:33:18.576 --> 01:33:20.544
Who's that?

01:33:20.662 --> 01:33:23.131
Is it the police?

01:33:23.248 --> 01:33:26.092
Oh, tell me where I am.

01:33:26.251 --> 01:33:28.345
You are in London, Mr. Van Meer.

01:33:28.461 --> 01:33:30.680
In London?

01:33:30.797 --> 01:33:32.925
Have I been here long?

01:33:34.759 --> 01:33:37.057
Oh, you must send
a telegram...

01:33:37.178 --> 01:33:38.930
to my wife.

01:33:39.097 --> 01:33:41.441
Tell her I am safe with you.

01:33:41.599 --> 01:33:44.478
Please try to understand.
The police are not here.

01:33:44.602 --> 01:33:47.151
I am here
merely to talk to you.

01:33:47.272 --> 01:33:50.276
But these... these people...

01:33:50.400 --> 01:33:53.529
They think I'm working with them.
They don't know I'm your friend.

01:33:53.653 --> 01:33:55.997
We must play a little game.

01:33:56.114 --> 01:33:58.617
- A little game?
- Yes.

01:33:58.783 --> 01:34:01.286
They have asked me
to get you to tell me...

01:34:01.411 --> 01:34:03.209
what they are trying
to find out.

01:34:03.329 --> 01:34:06.003
But I can't do that.

01:34:06.124 --> 01:34:08.001
<i>You know I can't.</i>

01:34:08.126 --> 01:34:10.504
You can tell me, Mr. Van Meer.

01:34:10.628 --> 01:34:14.349
Just that one clause
in the treaty. Clause 27.

01:34:14.466 --> 01:34:17.219
<i>Clause 27.</i>

01:34:17.343 --> 01:34:19.641
Come, Mr. Van Meer.

01:34:19.763 --> 01:34:23.108
But it's the... the secret clause.

01:34:23.224 --> 01:34:26.945
I know it: Clause 27.

01:34:27.062 --> 01:34:29.360
But they...
they mustn't know it.

01:34:29.481 --> 01:34:32.030
It would help them
if they make war.

01:34:32.150 --> 01:34:35.996
War, Fisher. You don't
want them helped, do you?

01:34:36.112 --> 01:34:37.910
Of course not.

01:34:38.031 --> 01:34:40.329
Just let them see you
telling it to me.

01:34:40.450 --> 01:34:42.077
It'll be enough.

01:34:42.202 --> 01:34:44.876
Just let them see you
whisper it to me.

01:34:44.996 --> 01:34:47.920
<i>I'll promise to keep it safe.</i>

01:34:48.041 --> 01:34:50.794
<i>He's not your friend.
Don't fell him.</i>

01:34:50.919 --> 01:34:52.842
<i>Who was that?</i>

01:34:53.838 --> 01:34:56.933
Someone just said
you weren't my friend.

01:34:58.676 --> 01:35:01.520
Why didn't you bring
the police?

01:35:01.679 --> 01:35:04.979
Why aren't you taking me
away from here?

01:35:06.101 --> 01:35:07.569
Ah.

01:35:07.685 --> 01:35:10.188
You are not taking me away.

01:35:11.272 --> 01:35:13.616
<i>Why?</i>

01:35:13.733 --> 01:35:15.360
<i>You are so...</i>

01:35:15.485 --> 01:35:17.328
<i>F-Fisher?</i>

01:35:18.780 --> 01:35:22.125
Fisher!
Fisher, where are you?

01:35:23.326 --> 01:35:25.078
<i>Help me.</i>

01:35:25.203 --> 01:35:27.001
Help me, Fi...
Help...

01:35:29.666 --> 01:35:32.419
Oh, yes.

01:35:32.544 --> 01:35:34.763
I see now.

01:35:34.879 --> 01:35:36.677
There's no help.

01:35:37.715 --> 01:35:41.185
<i>No help for the whole...</i>

01:35:41.302 --> 01:35:44.556
<i>poor, suffering world.</i>

01:35:45.557 --> 01:35:47.309
Oh, you...

01:35:47.433 --> 01:35:50.403
you cry peace, Fisher.

01:35:50.520 --> 01:35:53.399
Peace.
And there was no peace.

01:35:54.524 --> 01:35:58.324
<i>Only war and death.</i>

01:35:58.444 --> 01:36:01.869
<i>You're...
You're a liar, Fisher.</i>

01:36:01.990 --> 01:36:04.288
<i>A cruel, cruel liar.</i>

01:36:06.077 --> 01:36:09.422
You can do
what you want with me.

01:36:09.581 --> 01:36:12.084
That's not important.

01:36:12.208 --> 01:36:15.758
But you'll never
conquer them, Fisher.

01:36:17.297 --> 01:36:20.642
<i>Little people everywhere...</i>

01:36:20.758 --> 01:36:23.682
who give crumbs to birds...

01:36:23.803 --> 01:36:25.897
lie to them...

01:36:26.973 --> 01:36:30.273
drive them, whip them...

01:36:30.393 --> 01:36:33.647
force them into war.

01:36:33.771 --> 01:36:36.615
When the beasts like you...

01:36:36.774 --> 01:36:39.448
will devour each other...

01:36:40.945 --> 01:36:43.118
then the world...

01:36:44.699 --> 01:36:48.124
will belong
to the little people.

01:36:48.244 --> 01:36:50.167
We're wasting valuable time.

01:36:51.831 --> 01:36:53.299
Kurt.

01:37:18.775 --> 01:37:21.449
<i>All right. I...</i>

01:37:21.569 --> 01:37:23.697
I <i>will speak.</i>

01:37:25.657 --> 01:37:28.331
I <i>will tell everything.</i>

01:37:28.493 --> 01:37:30.336
<i>Come on, Mr. Fisher.</i>

01:37:32.789 --> 01:37:36.168
<i>In the event
of invasion by an enemy...</i>

01:37:39.545 --> 01:37:42.094
Why, it's only a restaurant.

01:37:42.215 --> 01:37:43.842
Look! Come on!

01:37:43.967 --> 01:37:46.686
This way, sir!
Down the back stairs!

01:38:12.412 --> 01:38:13.959
Follow me!

01:38:29.554 --> 01:38:33.058
Come on, Haverstock!
They must've gone out some other way!

01:38:43.067 --> 01:38:46.662
You're an idiot if you don't nab Fisher
before he gets on that plane.

01:38:46.779 --> 01:38:49.328
How can we arrest him
without any evidence?

01:38:49.449 --> 01:38:52.077
Don't be so obstinate. isn't
Van Meer himself proof enough?

01:38:52.201 --> 01:38:53.953
No, and you ought to know it.

01:38:54.078 --> 01:38:56.080
What proof is there
against Fisher personally?

01:38:56.205 --> 01:38:57.845
Of all the conceited,
stupid numbskulls...

01:38:57.915 --> 01:39:01.215
If you'd stop behaving like
a Boy Scout and let us handle this...

01:39:01.336 --> 01:39:03.088
Ask McKenna to come in here.

01:39:03.212 --> 01:39:06.011
Why don't you go see Dr. Boniface?
He's good for nerves.

01:39:06.132 --> 01:39:08.172
- Identification of Van Meer complete?
- Absolutely.

01:39:08.259 --> 01:39:11.729
He's unconscious in the nursing home,
but there's no doubt it's Van Meer.

01:39:11.846 --> 01:39:14.099
You'd better get back there.
Take somebody with you.

01:39:14.265 --> 01:39:16.518
Get a statement
as soon as he comes to.

01:39:16.642 --> 01:39:18.945
In the meantime, send a
man to keep an eye on

01:39:18.971 --> 01:39:21.423
that flying boat and await
instructions from us.

01:39:21.522 --> 01:39:23.862
What's the good of being
related to Scotland Yard?

01:39:23.888 --> 01:39:25.677
I can't get my brother
to do anything.

01:39:25.777 --> 01:39:27.312
Scotland Yard can't
solve my problems.

01:39:27.338 --> 01:39:29.227
Scotland Yard's in on it.
Everybody but me.

01:39:29.322 --> 01:39:33.623
You're in it too. We've got to get on
that plane and keep an eye on Fisher.

01:39:33.743 --> 01:39:36.462
While we're driving down,
ring up Mayfair 24574.

01:39:36.579 --> 01:39:39.082
- Just a moment. Let me get it down.
- Mayfair 24574.

01:39:39.207 --> 01:39:41.460
That's my cousin.
He's the director of the airline.

01:39:41.626 --> 01:39:45.381
Tell him I've got to have two seats on the
clipper for America tomorrow morning.

01:39:45.505 --> 01:39:48.634
Then go to the Hilton Nursing Home
and stick by Van Meer.

01:39:48.758 --> 01:39:52.604
<i>Then phone Miss Edith Armbruster, Kensington
66255 Tell her I'm off to America.</i>

01:39:52.720 --> 01:39:55.223
<i>Will she dine with me next Monday
instead of tomorrow?</i>

01:39:55.348 --> 01:39:57.442
- <i>Square it with her, will you .7</i>
- Sure, sure.

01:39:57.558 --> 01:40:01.313
Then call up Stephens at the Post
and tell him I'm off to America.

01:40:01.479 --> 01:40:03.823
<i>Cable New York.
Tell them I'm off to America.</i>

01:40:03.940 --> 01:40:08.116
Then ring up the Crescent
Dancing Academy and cancel my rumba lesson.

01:40:08.236 --> 01:40:10.580
Two ham sandwiches on rye bread.

01:40:12.198 --> 01:40:14.951
There's no use my waiting around.
I have several things...

01:40:15.076 --> 01:40:19.001
Hard to say how soon he'll recover.
It may be hours before he can speak.

01:40:19.122 --> 01:40:22.171
I don't know much about this,
but my friend's on the clipper.

01:40:22.291 --> 01:40:25.170
The minute Van Meer speaks,
they'll send word to the plane.

01:40:25.336 --> 01:40:27.555
Did you hear the wireless?
We're at war.

01:40:27.672 --> 01:40:31.142
<i>War declared!
Read all about it! Special war edition!</i>

01:40:31.259 --> 01:40:33.136
War declared! War!

01:40:33.261 --> 01:40:35.810
It's war with Germany!
War declared!

01:40:35.930 --> 01:40:38.183
England declares war
on Germany!

01:41:04.375 --> 01:41:07.800
Miss Pimm?
Miss Pimm, I found that picture.

01:41:23.394 --> 01:41:26.238
- Steward, bring me one of those, please.
- Yes, sir.

01:41:57.595 --> 01:41:59.939
- Any message for me?
- What name, sir?

01:42:00.056 --> 01:42:02.684
Steward, is there a message
for me? Mrs. Benson.

01:42:02.808 --> 01:42:05.061
I'll be with you
in a minute, madam.

01:42:05.186 --> 01:42:07.439
- This one's for me.
- Yes, sir.

01:42:20.284 --> 01:42:22.252
<i>Lovely, isn't it?</i>

01:42:22.370 --> 01:42:25.749
Sort of makes you forget
all about the war and troubles.

01:42:25.873 --> 01:42:28.547
It would be nice
if we could just keep flying...

01:42:28.668 --> 01:42:31.171
for a long time,
live in the clouds.

01:42:31.295 --> 01:42:33.297
Yes, it would be very nice.

01:42:35.049 --> 01:42:37.723
But it's time for me
to make a landing...

01:42:37.843 --> 01:42:39.811
a forced landing.

01:42:39.929 --> 01:42:41.931
What's the matter?
Anything happen?

01:42:42.056 --> 01:42:45.606
I've got to talk to you.
I don't want to, but I've got to.

01:42:45.726 --> 01:42:48.070
It's the hardest part...
talking to you now.

01:42:48.187 --> 01:42:50.440
<i>I don't mind
about the rest, really.</i>

01:42:50.565 --> 01:42:53.364
It's about Krug
and Van Meer.

01:42:53.484 --> 01:42:54.952
You've guessed.

01:42:55.069 --> 01:42:58.494
Not till last night.
I've just been worried.

01:42:58.656 --> 01:43:00.454
But I believed in you.

01:43:00.575 --> 01:43:02.248
You shouldn't.

01:43:03.995 --> 01:43:06.839
It's true, then,
what I wouldn't believe?

01:43:06.956 --> 01:43:08.503
Yes.

01:43:08.624 --> 01:43:10.501
I'm to be arrested
when we land...

01:43:10.626 --> 01:43:13.505
- Oh!
<i>- As a spy, shipped back to London.</i>

01:43:13.629 --> 01:43:16.508
- Father...
- That's quite all right, except...

01:43:16.674 --> 01:43:19.268
just the one phase of it: you.

01:43:20.344 --> 01:43:22.597
That's why
I've got to talk to you.

01:43:23.806 --> 01:43:27.310
I should like you to hear a little
from my own point of view.

01:43:27.435 --> 01:43:31.736
<i>It might help you...
afterwards.</i>

01:43:31.856 --> 01:43:34.905
First about yourself,
my deceiving you.

01:43:35.026 --> 01:43:38.872
I had to. I didn't want you involved because
you're English... half English, anyway.

01:43:39.030 --> 01:43:42.830
<i>I'm not. I'm just coated with
an English accent... a very thin coat.</i>

01:43:42.950 --> 01:43:47.205
I've fought for my country
in my heart in a very difficult way...

01:43:47.371 --> 01:43:49.840
because sometimes it's harder
to fight dishonorably...

01:43:49.957 --> 01:43:52.255
than nobly in the open.

01:43:52.376 --> 01:43:55.255
I've used my country's methods
because I was born with them.

01:43:55.379 --> 01:43:59.976
<i>I don't intend making this sort
of plea to the court-martial.</i>

01:44:00.092 --> 01:44:03.722
<i>I'm making it only to my daughter,
whom I've loved dearly...</i>

01:44:03.888 --> 01:44:07.062
and before whom
I feel a little...

01:44:07.183 --> 01:44:08.856
ashamed.

01:44:12.730 --> 01:44:17.327
What you say to me now means much
more to me than any other verdict...

01:44:17.443 --> 01:44:18.865
my dear.

01:44:18.986 --> 01:44:21.284
- Steward?
- Yes, sir?

01:44:21.405 --> 01:44:23.624
This is not for me.
I was mistaken.

01:44:25.284 --> 01:44:28.538
I'm not gonna sit here another 14 hours
and play hide-and-seek with her.

01:44:28.663 --> 01:44:30.791
I'm gonna talk to her
and have it over with.

01:44:30.915 --> 01:44:34.636
I don't see that you could do any harm.
He knows we're on the plane.

01:44:34.752 --> 01:44:38.097
- Not a word in front of her, understand?
- I wouldn't dream of talking.

01:44:38.214 --> 01:44:41.593
- What are you going to say?
- How do I know? I'm all mixed up.

01:44:41.717 --> 01:44:44.596
In love with the girl
and gonna help hang her father.

01:44:44.720 --> 01:44:46.722
I've got to say something
or go crazy.

01:44:47.765 --> 01:44:50.143
Would a little brandy
make you feel better?

01:44:50.267 --> 01:44:52.941
You know it always
makes me cry harder.

01:44:53.104 --> 01:44:54.902
- Oh!
- Surprise.

01:44:55.022 --> 01:44:58.617
- What are you doing here?
- Just having myself a ride.

01:44:58.734 --> 01:45:01.362
Look, Carol,
I've got to speak to you alone.

01:45:01.487 --> 01:45:03.615
It's very important.
Do you mind, Mr. Fisher?

01:45:03.739 --> 01:45:06.618
- ffolliott's with you, isn't he?
- In a way, yes.

01:45:06.742 --> 01:45:08.540
And you're both
after my father.

01:45:08.661 --> 01:45:11.289
You're going to have him
arrested, aren't you?

01:45:11.414 --> 01:45:14.964
I don't know what you're talking about.
I never arrested anyone in my life.

01:45:15.084 --> 01:45:17.963
That's a lie. You've been
following him from the beginning.

01:45:18.087 --> 01:45:21.387
That's why you wanted me
out of the way yesterday at the inn.

01:45:21.507 --> 01:45:24.556
Pretended you loved me, tried to
keep me overnight so you could...

01:45:24.677 --> 01:45:28.398
it's a lie, that's all. Everything
you've said to me have been lies.

01:45:28.514 --> 01:45:30.858
- Hello. Quite a reunion, isn't it?
- You too?

01:45:30.975 --> 01:45:33.194
Please, dear.
Stay and have a drink, Scott.

01:45:33.310 --> 01:45:35.187
- I'll be back.
- Where are you going?

01:45:35.312 --> 01:45:38.111
Just to stretch my legs.
I read that wireless you received.

01:45:38.232 --> 01:45:41.111
<i>- It was given to me by mistake.</i>
- That's all right, sir.

01:45:41.235 --> 01:45:43.738
You're not going
unless I go with you.

01:45:43.863 --> 01:45:47.208
I know you both think my father
is a traitor and a renegade.

01:45:47.324 --> 01:45:49.326
Well, he isn't... not to me.

01:45:49.452 --> 01:45:51.796
Thanks. It's a minority report,
but very welcome.

01:45:51.912 --> 01:45:54.085
Carol, I've got nothing
to do with spies.

01:45:54.206 --> 01:45:56.709
I'm just a reporter.
I came here after a story.

01:45:56.834 --> 01:45:59.587
I'm sorry I heard of Van Meer.
I'd blow up the <i>Globe...</i>

01:45:59.712 --> 01:46:02.135
and cut Mr. Powers's throat
rather than harm you.

01:46:06.343 --> 01:46:08.016
What is it?

01:46:10.639 --> 01:46:13.020
They've gone crazy. What
do they think they're doing?

01:46:13.046 --> 01:46:13.838
Who are they?

01:46:13.934 --> 01:46:17.108
Go below. Tell them
we're being attacked.

01:46:22.610 --> 01:46:25.614
Sorry about this.
It has nothing to do with me.

01:46:25.738 --> 01:46:26.627
We're coming down.

01:46:26.653 --> 01:46:29.813
You're the most amazing,
cool-headed woman I've ever seen.

01:46:29.909 --> 01:46:31.206
- Make Father wear this.
- Right.

01:46:31.327 --> 01:46:32.954
Here you are.
Put these on.

01:46:34.830 --> 01:46:36.457
Keep changing.

01:46:36.582 --> 01:46:39.085
Could you come out, sir?
They're all going nuts!

01:46:39.210 --> 01:46:43.590
I'll be out immediately. What am I going
to say? This isn't like bad weather.

01:46:43.714 --> 01:46:46.058
Tell them it's a mistake,
that it's target practice.

01:46:47.441 --> 01:46:50.296
<i>I know it's foolish for
me to ask you to be calm.</i>

01:46:50.387 --> 01:46:52.355
We're doing the best we can.

01:46:59.438 --> 01:47:01.941
Are we all going to be drowned?

01:47:02.066 --> 01:47:04.160
Keep away
from that window, sir.

01:47:04.276 --> 01:47:06.324
It might be dangerous.
Sit back.

01:47:06.445 --> 01:47:09.289
I'm not going to put this on.

01:47:09.406 --> 01:47:12.580
What are they firing at?
I never heard of anything so stupid.

01:47:12.701 --> 01:47:14.999
I shall see the British consul
as soon as...

01:47:28.884 --> 01:47:30.557
She's gone.

01:47:36.058 --> 01:47:38.356
What in the name of heaven
are they doing?

01:47:45.901 --> 01:47:48.324
Switch off the gas.
You've got the other port motor.

01:47:48.445 --> 01:47:50.884
They cut off the other starboard motor.
Cut that off too.

01:47:50.910 --> 01:47:51.519
Right.

01:47:51.615 --> 01:47:54.539
It's German, the Von Schier.
She thought we were a bomber.

01:47:54.660 --> 01:47:56.253
She's steaming to our rescue.

01:47:56.370 --> 01:47:59.294
<i>The Wing's coming off!</i>

01:48:02.084 --> 01:48:05.088
- Let me get out!
- Come away from that door!

01:48:05.212 --> 01:48:06.680
We're crazy to stay here.

01:48:06.797 --> 01:48:09.554
When she hits the water,
the tail's the best place.

01:48:09.580 --> 01:48:11.328
Right.
Let's get back there.

01:48:43.375 --> 01:48:44.627
<i>Look out!</i>

01:49:09.652 --> 01:49:11.370
Mr. Fisher!

01:49:12.571 --> 01:49:14.039
Quick!

01:50:43.871 --> 01:50:46.374
No good staying on here.
She's going under.

01:50:46.498 --> 01:50:47.966
<i>Quick! Onto the wing!</i>

01:51:41.428 --> 01:51:43.681
Look! There's the pilot!

01:52:10.457 --> 01:52:12.966
Don't let him on, fools!
We shall all go down!

01:52:12.992 --> 01:52:14.112
Shut your mouth!

01:52:14.211 --> 01:52:16.680
- I'm gonna throw that swine off.
- No, he's right.

01:52:16.797 --> 01:52:19.425
<i>It won't hold us.
I'd better slip away.</i>

01:52:19.550 --> 01:52:22.850
Quickly move to the other end.
That might make it lighter here.

01:52:41.071 --> 01:52:43.574
Hurry! He's gone!

01:52:54.084 --> 01:52:57.384
Johnny, don't go!
You'll be washed away!

01:53:04.011 --> 01:53:05.604
Johnny, come back!

01:53:38.420 --> 01:53:40.138
Look!

01:53:42.591 --> 01:53:45.310
It must be the enemy
coming to pick us up.

01:53:46.303 --> 01:53:47.850
Is it the enemy?

01:53:47.971 --> 01:53:50.394
We're all right.
She's American.

01:53:54.353 --> 01:53:57.653
American ship Mohican picked
us all up, taking us back to London.

01:53:57.773 --> 01:54:00.151
I can't tell you what happened.
We're not allowed.

01:54:00.317 --> 01:54:03.491
I'll wire from London
in a couple of days. Bye, Franklin.

01:54:03.612 --> 01:54:06.957
This is awkward. I've just been
having a dirty row with the captain.

01:54:07.074 --> 01:54:09.076
The fellow insists on acting
the true-blue neutral.

01:54:09.201 --> 01:54:12.171
"Enemy waters." Not a line
to the press from his ship.

01:54:12.287 --> 01:54:13.482
Can't send out any stories?

01:54:13.508 --> 01:54:15.987
We can only use the wireless
for private messages.

01:54:16.083 --> 01:54:19.087
"Hello, Aunt Effie. Safe aboard
the Mohican. Feeling tip-top."

01:54:19.211 --> 01:54:23.762
I ask you! Two days before we get to
London, we get scooped on our own story.

01:54:23.882 --> 01:54:25.993
Why don't you have a
crack at brass buttons?

01:54:26.019 --> 01:54:26.956
What's the use?

01:54:27.052 --> 01:54:29.521
What good will it do me?
My hands are tied.

01:54:29.680 --> 01:54:31.353
- What are you talking about?
- Carol.

01:54:31.473 --> 01:54:33.271
I came 4,000 miles
to get a story.

01:54:33.392 --> 01:54:35.861
I get shot at like a duck,
pushed off buildings...

01:54:35.978 --> 01:54:38.731
I get the story,
and then I got to shut up.

01:54:38.855 --> 01:54:42.234
What are you grinning at? I'm not
gonna throw her father up for grabs.

01:54:42.359 --> 01:54:45.738
<i>He died like a hero to save
her and the rest of us.</i>

01:54:45.862 --> 01:54:48.365
<i>I guess I'm talking
through my hat.</i>

01:54:48.490 --> 01:54:50.538
<i>The whole point is
he was her father...</i>

01:54:50.659 --> 01:54:53.128
<i>and I'm not gonna play
Judas to the only girl...</i>

01:54:53.245 --> 01:54:55.122
I'm glad you've said that.
Very glad.

01:54:55.247 --> 01:54:57.375
- You dry? You all right?
- I'm all right.

01:54:57.541 --> 01:54:59.794
I want you to send it,
the whole story.

01:54:59.918 --> 01:55:02.012
- We'll talk about that later.
- No, please.

01:55:02.129 --> 01:55:05.178
You can't help me
by protecting my father.

01:55:05.299 --> 01:55:09.725
Listen, I'm in love with you. I can't hit
you with a scandal for a wedding present.

01:55:09.845 --> 01:55:13.566
Johnny, my father fought
for his country his way.

01:55:13.724 --> 01:55:16.603
It wasn't a straight way,
but it was a hard way.

01:55:16.727 --> 01:55:19.856
And I've got to fight
for my country a hard way.

01:55:19.980 --> 01:55:22.654
Okay, if that's the way
you feel about it.

01:55:22.774 --> 01:55:25.402
I guess that's for me.

01:55:25.527 --> 01:55:28.997
I put in a call to my uncle...
Uncle Powers.

01:55:29.114 --> 01:55:31.583
Hello? Hello?

01:55:31.700 --> 01:55:33.418
Johnny Jones
calling from the Mohican.

01:55:33.577 --> 01:55:37.582
What the deuce is he doing there? Wait.
Johnny wouldn't call if it wasn't a story.

01:55:37.706 --> 01:55:40.209
Tell them to hold the presses.
Send Bradley in.

01:55:40.334 --> 01:55:42.632
Tell him we're breaking up
page one. Hello?

01:55:42.753 --> 01:55:44.755
Hello, Mr. Powers.
This is Johnny Jones.

01:55:44.880 --> 01:55:46.427
Easy.
Here comes the captain.

01:55:49.217 --> 01:55:51.561
Mr. Powers, keep your ear
glued to this phone...

01:55:51.678 --> 01:55:53.430
and don't hang up.

01:55:58.935 --> 01:56:01.284
Mr. Haverstock, I
want to talk with you.

01:56:01.310 --> 01:56:01.964
<i>Yes, sir?</i>

01:56:02.105 --> 01:56:03.877
I've just found out
you're a newspaperman.

01:56:03.903 --> 01:56:04.974
I guess that's right.

01:56:05.067 --> 01:56:08.037
Why didn't you tell me that
when I questioned you?

01:56:08.153 --> 01:56:10.576
- You lied to me, sir.
- My dear captain...

01:56:10.697 --> 01:56:13.951
when you've been shot down in
a British plane by a German destroyer...

01:56:14.117 --> 01:56:17.121
300 miles off the coast of
England... latitude 45...

01:56:17.245 --> 01:56:19.794
and have been hanging on
to a half-submerged wing for hours...

01:56:19.915 --> 01:56:22.964
waiting to drown with half a dozen
other stricken human beings...

01:56:23.126 --> 01:56:25.845
you're liable to forget
you're a newspaperman for a moment.

01:56:25.962 --> 01:56:29.933
You're gonna have to forget it
for as long as you're on this ship.

01:56:30.050 --> 01:56:31.973
I can't understand
your attitude, sir.

01:56:32.135 --> 01:56:35.014
You performed a heroic rescue.
Captain John Martin.

01:56:35.138 --> 01:56:36.326
<i>You took us out of the sea.</i>

01:56:36.352 --> 01:56:38.508
<i>You're not sending
anything from this ship.</i>

01:56:38.600 --> 01:56:40.853
<i>- That's final.</i>
- You're absolutely right, Captain.

01:56:40.977 --> 01:56:43.321
We mustn't embarrass
the United States government.

01:56:43.438 --> 01:56:44.860
Exactly. That's my point.

01:56:46.942 --> 01:56:49.991
That's the story.
If you don't want me to print it, okay.

01:56:50.112 --> 01:56:52.581
- But you ought to hear it first.
- That's only fair.

01:56:56.743 --> 01:57:00.213
You know who the head of that movement
was in London? Stephen Fisher.

01:57:00.330 --> 01:57:04.005
What? You mean the man who ran the
Universal Peace Party? That's preposterous!

01:57:04.126 --> 01:57:07.130
Yes, the same Mr. Fisher
who was drowned a few hours ago.

01:57:07.254 --> 01:57:10.349
He was using the Peace Party
as a cover-up for spies and traitors.

01:57:10.465 --> 01:57:12.718
<i>He was going to be arrested
and sent back to England.</i>

01:57:12.843 --> 01:57:13.844
Those are facts.

01:57:13.870 --> 01:57:16.998
I can't believe it. He
was a friend of mine.

01:57:17.097 --> 01:57:20.692
<i>The same Stephen Fisher who engineered the
kidnapping of Van Meer, the Dutch diplomat.</i>

01:57:20.809 --> 01:57:22.536
You don't expect
anybody to believe that.

01:57:22.562 --> 01:57:23.383
It's the truth.

01:57:23.520 --> 01:57:25.443
- I refuse...
- Captain, wait a minute.

01:57:25.564 --> 01:57:27.572
This young lady should
know whether my friend

01:57:27.598 --> 01:57:29.344
is speaking the truth
about Mr. Fisher.

01:57:29.443 --> 01:57:32.743
Yes, I ought to know.
Mr. Fisher was... my father.

01:57:32.863 --> 01:57:35.833
<i>And I want the story printed.</i>

01:57:35.949 --> 01:57:37.542
What's that?

01:57:37.659 --> 01:57:40.879
Oh, I guess
that's my uncle. Uh...

01:57:41.037 --> 01:57:43.165
Hello? Oh, hello, Uncle.
How are you?

01:57:45.333 --> 01:57:48.587
How's Aunt Sadie?
I'm all right, thanks.

01:57:48.712 --> 01:57:52.057
We had a little accident,
but I can't tell you about it now.

01:57:52.174 --> 01:57:55.974
I'll tell you later. I'll write you.
Yes, I'm going back to Europe.

01:57:56.094 --> 01:57:58.768
I was wondering
if you had any instructions for me.

01:57:58.889 --> 01:58:00.983
Yes. Keep on the job.

01:58:01.099 --> 01:58:03.602
Have you got all that?
Rush it out at once.

01:58:16.490 --> 01:58:19.084
This is London.
We have as a guest tonight...

01:58:19.201 --> 01:58:20.999
one of the soldiers
of the press...

01:58:21.119 --> 01:58:23.918
one of the little army
of historians writing history...

01:58:24.039 --> 01:58:26.041
from beside
the cannon's mouth...

01:58:26.166 --> 01:58:29.466
the foreign correspondent of the <i>New
York Globe,</i> Huntley Haverstock.

01:58:29.586 --> 01:58:31.088
Hello, America.

01:58:31.254 --> 01:58:34.383
I've been watching a part
of the world being blown to pieces.

01:58:34.508 --> 01:58:37.261
A part of the world as nice
as Vermont and Ohio...

01:58:37.965 --> 01:58:39.412
and Virginia and
California and Illinois...

01:58:39.513 --> 01:58:42.312
lies ripped up and bleeding
like a steer in a slaughterhouse.

01:58:42.432 --> 01:58:45.982
I've seen things that make the history of
the savages read like Pollyanna legends...

01:58:46.102 --> 01:58:48.730
it's a raid. We shall have
to postpone the broadcast.

01:58:48.855 --> 01:58:52.405
- Let's go on as long as we can.
- We have a shelter downstairs.

01:58:52.526 --> 01:58:54.449
<i>How about it, Carol?</i>

01:58:54.569 --> 01:58:57.413
- They're listening in America, Johnny.
- Okay.

01:58:57.531 --> 01:58:59.454
We'll tell them, then.

01:58:59.574 --> 01:59:02.828
I can't read the rest of the speech...
the lights have gone out...

01:59:02.953 --> 01:59:05.251
so I'll just have to talk
off the cuff.

01:59:05.372 --> 01:59:08.672
All that noise you hear isn't static.
It's death coming to London.

01:59:08.792 --> 01:59:12.342
They're coming now. You can hear the
bombs falling on the streets and homes.

01:59:12.462 --> 01:59:16.342
Don't tune me out. This is a big
story, and you're part of it.

01:59:16.466 --> 01:59:20.516
It's too late to do anything here except
stand in the dark and let them come.

01:59:20.637 --> 01:59:24.016
It's as if the lights were all out
everywhere... except in America.

01:59:24.140 --> 01:59:26.108
Keep those lights burning.

01:59:26.226 --> 01:59:28.445
Cover them with steel,
ring them with guns...

01:59:28.562 --> 01:59:31.657
build a canopy of battleships
and bombing planes around them.

01:59:31.815 --> 01:59:34.034
Hello, America!
Hang on to your lights.

01:59:34.150 --> 01:59:36.653
They're the only lights left
in the world.
