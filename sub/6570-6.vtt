It is. And how are you?

00:25.400 --> 00:26.401
(BOTH LAUGHING)

00:26.480 --> 00:27.527
Hey, how are you?

00:27.600 --> 00:29.284
Do you work out?
You do.

00:29.360 --> 00:30.805
Thank you. How are you?

00:30.880 --> 00:32.484
Are you two going to get married?

00:32.560 --> 00:34.722
- Who?
- She's way out of my league.

00:34.800 --> 00:36.802
That's the correct answer.

00:36.880 --> 00:39.167
- We love you, Tom James.
- Thank you. Love you, too.

00:39.240 --> 00:43.165
I mean, within obviously acceptable
propriety and so on. Hey, nice to meet you.

00:43.240 --> 00:44.969
President's gonna love these headlines.

00:45.040 --> 00:47.247
-"Dream Ticket."

00:47.320 --> 00:49.607
"Dynamic Duo."

00:49.680 --> 00:52.126
"Tom James, Best POTUS We Never Had."

00:53.320 --> 00:54.810
Okay, please don't show her that one.

00:54.880 --> 00:57.008
Pennsylvania, I wish we didn't have to go.

00:57.080 --> 00:59.890
And how great is Tom James, right?

00:59.960 --> 01:01.644
We'll see you guys soon.

01:02.080 --> 01:04.400
If I have any more of those funnel cakes,

01:04.480 --> 01:06.050
I won't be able to fit through the bus door.

01:06.120 --> 01:07.884
(CROWD LAUGHS)

01:07.960 --> 01:10.930
It's true. Those funnel cakes are just great.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.651
We'll see you guys soon. Thank you.

01:13.760 --> 01:15.250
You won't be able to miss us.

01:15.320 --> 01:16.810
(CROWD LAUGHS)

01:17.320 --> 01:21.370
It's true, because if...
We'll eat them and then we'll get so fat.

01:21.440 --> 01:23.681
So fat. Thank you!

01:24.600 --> 01:26.921
Thank you. No, don't talk anymore. No.

(SIRENS WAILING)

01:30.880 --> 01:35.124
No, what I said was Amy Brookheimer
had issues, not problems.

01:35.240 --> 01:37.641
No, she got mad. She's not mentally mad.

01:37.720 --> 01:39.085
Great crowds, right?

01:39.200 --> 01:42.363
I mean, you are box office platinum,
my friend.

01:42.440 --> 01:44.442
Madam President, I am here to serve.

01:44.520 --> 01:46.045
You are the sun, I the moon.

01:46.120 --> 01:48.122

01:52.360 --> 01:54.966

You know, a wolf is actually a pack animal.

02:10.080 --> 02:11.570
I'm more of a lone squirrel.

02:11.640 --> 02:15.804
You both need to choose bicycles
for the Bike For Health event.

02:15.880 --> 02:17.405
- Oh, right.
- Mountain bike, road bike, whatever.

02:18.200 --> 02:19.850
Fun fact.

02:19.920 --> 02:21.331
The Wright brothers

02:21.400 --> 02:23.846
used their bicycle repair shop
to make the first airplane.

02:23.920 --> 02:24.967
- I knew that.
-(PHONE RINGS)

02:26.240 --> 02:27.401

02:27.480 --> 02:28.527
- Thanks for calling back.
- Get up.

02:28.600 --> 02:31.365
Fun fact. We're running a campaign here,
not a bake sale.

02:31.440 --> 02:32.487
KENT: Exactly right.

02:33.480 --> 02:34.891
Hey, what's going on?

02:34.960 --> 02:38.169
There is sexual tension on this bus.

02:43.400 --> 02:45.323
- Me.
- Right.

02:45.400 --> 02:47.641
Did you get a load of that
lone squirrel comment?

02:47.720 --> 02:48.721
- Oh, my God.
- Did you hear that?

02:48.800 --> 02:50.643
- And that means?
- Exactly.

02:50.720 --> 02:52.006
- Exactly.
- And you saw the way

02:52.080 --> 02:54.242
he crossed his legs
towards me as soon as I sat down?

02:54.360 --> 02:56.328
- Totally. Totally.
- Did you see that? God.

02:56.920 --> 02:58.922
See, the thing is, I never...

02:59.000 --> 03:01.651
- I never told you this, but...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah?

03:01.720 --> 03:04.530
- I think it was about 12 years ago.
- Uh-huh.

03:04.600 --> 03:06.967
- We almost...
- Kissed?

03:07.080 --> 03:08.127
-...fucked.
- Okay.

03:08.200 --> 03:09.850
- Ma'am, Ben's on the phone.
- Oh.

03:10.560 --> 03:12.210
We got a storm brewing, ma'am.

03:12.280 --> 03:14.886
Is it Israel or is it China?

03:14.960 --> 03:16.371
<i>BEN: No, it's an actual hurricane.</i>

03:16.440 --> 03:18.886
And it's about to take
North Carolina from behind.

03:18.960 --> 03:21.770
I guess I have to get there
after the hurricane's passed, right?

03:21.840 --> 03:24.320
Ma'am, we can track the storm from here.
I have a weather app.

03:24.400 --> 03:26.721
We have the full power of
the National Weather Service, Mike.

03:26.800 --> 03:28.882
Sure, but this is a really good app.

- Uh-huh.
<i>- We'II be in touch.</i>

03:30.360 --> 03:31.646

03:31.760 --> 03:33.808
Mike, listen.

03:33.880 --> 03:36.929
I want you to get more op-ed pieces out there

03:37.000 --> 03:39.765
about how my choosing Tom
was an act of real vision

03:39.840 --> 03:41.683
and real leadership, okay?

03:41.760 --> 03:44.570
I've been pushing, ma'am,
but they're gaga over Tom James.

03:44.640 --> 03:45.721
People love Tom,

03:45.800 --> 03:47.768
but I want to get credit for choosing him.

03:47.840 --> 03:49.888
- Yes, ma'am.
- Headline thought.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.889
I want more headlines.

03:52.000 --> 03:52.967
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes.

03:53.040 --> 03:55.361
- You want to see the storm?
- No.

03:58.160 --> 03:59.685
- Hey, Sue.
- Sir.

04:00.280 --> 04:02.487
- Keeping busy?
- Yes.

04:05.160 --> 04:06.685
So quiet in here.

04:06.760 --> 04:09.286
It's like a morgue full of dead librarians.

04:09.360 --> 04:10.930
I happen to like the quiet, sir.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.924
It allows me to get things done
when I am busy like I am now.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.685
Yeah, I miss everybody, even Kent.

04:19.680 --> 04:24.208
Well, great struggling to talk to you.

04:25.760 --> 04:28.684
Oh, God, this place has been dead
ever since Doyle left the ticket.

04:29.400 --> 04:32.768
Doyle, Amy, Lee, Karen, Dan.

04:32.840 --> 04:36.322
I mean, this place is leaking bodies
faster than a Chinese ferry.

04:36.400 --> 04:37.606
You know what?

04:37.680 --> 04:39.808
Just as I was getting
some responsibility, right...

04:40.360 --> 04:42.249
- Hey, Jonah.
- Hey.

04:42.320 --> 04:43.287

- How are the testes, Jonah?

04:57.720 --> 04:59.484
Uh, they're fine, sir. Thank you.

04:59.560 --> 05:02.325
We have the notes
from the dairy tariffs meetings.

05:02.400 --> 05:04.607
Yeah. Put it in that pile over there
with everything else.

05:04.680 --> 05:06.330
I'll set fire to it later.

05:25.120 --> 05:27.009
You've lived a very interesting life.

05:27.080 --> 05:28.320
You should write your memoirs.

I was Veep, they polled other candidates,
fucked me in my slack old ass.

05:32.720 --> 05:34.245
- Sound like a best seller?
- I'd read it.

05:34.320 --> 05:37.324
I'd read anything, though.
I love to read. You know, it's...

05:43.800 --> 05:45.723
Have you mentioned that moment to Tom yet?

05:45.800 --> 05:46.961
What? Are you... Stop...

05:47.760 --> 05:49.922
Okay, you're just gonna do a short circuit.
Right?

05:50.040 --> 05:51.280
- Yes.
- And you may wave

05:51.400 --> 05:54.290
if you feel that you can
keep control of the machine here.

05:54.360 --> 05:57.443
- The machine? You mean the bike?
- Right, the bike. Sorry.

05:57.520 --> 06:00.126
Yeah, I can't fall off, you know.
I don't want to break a tit.

- Do you bike much, Tom?
- Oh, God, no.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.923
- Hardly at all.
- Me neither.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.367
I did do the Tour of Italy 2008,

06:12.440 --> 06:15.250
-but my mountain times were embarrassing.

Madam President, would you say that
Tom James is a star?

06:20.480 --> 06:22.608
No, I would not say Tom James is a star.

- I would say he's a superstar.
-(LAUGHTER)

06:25.600 --> 06:27.409

Don't you think I did?

- Yes, you did.
- Good.

06:29.360 --> 06:30.930

No, you just do whatever you want.

That's a great image. Vital, dynamic.

Self-congratulations are in order.

06:55.320 --> 06:56.526
Amy's still pissed at me.

06:56.600 --> 07:00.446
It's 'cause I sent that press release out
saying she resigned 'cause she's unstable.

07:00.520 --> 07:02.409
She is unstable.

07:02.480 --> 07:04.209
It was a big mistake to say it, though.

(PHONE CHIMES)

07:05.960 --> 07:07.928
Great. Another hate text from Amy.

Are you going through the change?"

Or all the other rooms
where we also make money.

See Mike's statement
implying that I was unstable?

07:25.960 --> 07:28.691
- Yeah, look...
- They're doing a pancake breakfast?

07:28.800 --> 07:30.882
Hello, I suggested that a week ago

07:30.960 --> 07:33.088
and I was shot down like
a hang glider over the Pentagon.

07:33.160 --> 07:36.448
Amy, I'm offering you
an incredible opportunity here, okay?

07:36.560 --> 07:39.211
So let's cut out the whole
"keep her away from scissors" thing.

07:39.280 --> 07:40.281
- Okay.
- Yeah?

07:40.360 --> 07:44.285
Ah, Sidney Purcell, I offer for your delectation
one Miss Amy Brookheimer.

07:44.400 --> 07:45.367
Well, look at me.

07:45.440 --> 07:47.329
I have more White House staff
than the White House.

07:47.400 --> 07:48.765
And a whiter building.

07:48.840 --> 07:50.808
Well, I hope that it's a different vibe

07:50.880 --> 07:53.326
because I am putting
all of that stuff behind me.

07:53.400 --> 07:55.607
- Great. We need someone...
- Selina Meyer is yesterday's news

07:55.680 --> 07:56.806
as far as I'm concerned.

07:56.880 --> 07:59.451
Good, because I have
a big GMJ client I need tied up

07:59.520 --> 08:01.682
and I think your West Wing access
should bring him right in.

08:01.760 --> 08:03.569
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We can trap and truss him, right, Ames?

08:03.640 --> 08:07.531
Yeah, if people want access
to that backstabbing madhouse,

08:07.600 --> 08:09.409
then I think we're the ones to get it for him.

08:09.480 --> 08:11.005
Maybe you can refer to it as the White House

08:11.080 --> 08:13.924
since some of our clients actually
still like and respect that place.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.650
- Okay?
- Yeah, all good.

08:15.720 --> 08:17.324
What's he talking about? I said White House.

08:17.400 --> 08:18.765
Let's get you a decaf.

08:18.840 --> 08:21.571
This is ridiculous.
My talents are being wasted here.

08:21.640 --> 08:22.846
I'm like Picasso

08:22.920 --> 08:24.524
-and I'm stuck painting fences.
- Yeah.

08:24.600 --> 08:26.523
Senator Wilkie has been begging to see me.

08:26.600 --> 08:28.443
And lots of other people want meetings, too.

08:28.520 --> 08:29.806
VP Doyle's a lame duck.

08:29.880 --> 08:31.041
And you know what you do
with lame animals?

08:31.120 --> 08:33.009
- You care for them.
- You shoot them dead.

08:33.080 --> 08:35.207
Oh, no, yeah, I got you.
Kinder in the long run, actually.

08:35.440 --> 08:37.169
(SIRENS WAILING)

08:39.880 --> 08:42.486
Uh, Tom, can I ask you a question?

08:42.559 --> 08:43.527
Sure.

08:43.600 --> 08:46.001
It's about a little moment in time.

08:46.080 --> 08:47.445
Might need to narrow that down a little.

08:47.520 --> 08:48.760
(LAUGHS) I know.

08:50.840 --> 08:53.889
Back in D.C., you and me.

08:53.960 --> 08:56.770
I think it was about 12 years ago.

08:56.840 --> 09:01.050
Sure, I... Yeah. We used to hang out a lot
during my first term.

09:01.120 --> 09:05.682
It was that late night
after the Sharpley debate.

09:06.320 --> 09:07.321
Oh.

09:08.520 --> 09:09.965
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

09:10.680 --> 09:12.489
- Ah. Yeah, right.
- Right.

09:12.560 --> 09:13.800
(LAUGHS)

09:14.880 --> 09:16.962
Yeah. Yeah. What...

09:17.040 --> 09:18.724
- We shared that cab.
- We shared a cab.

09:18.800 --> 09:21.849
- Right.
- The night of the green shoes.

09:21.920 --> 09:23.206
Oh!

09:23.280 --> 09:25.009
Look at you,

09:25.080 --> 09:27.606
remembering the shoes.

09:27.680 --> 09:30.763
They gave you blisters.

09:30.880 --> 09:32.928
Or was it... No, it was corns.

09:33.640 --> 09:34.641
Or...

09:35.200 --> 09:38.090
No, it wasn't corns. Not... l don't get corns.

09:41.480 --> 09:42.561
(SIGHS)

09:42.640 --> 09:45.769
Anyway, we got out of the cab at my house,

09:45.840 --> 09:46.841
and, um...

09:49.000 --> 09:52.766
The cold got to us and then you decided

09:52.840 --> 09:54.729
you wanted to walk home.

09:56.160 --> 09:58.970
Yeah, I love to walk at night.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.611
It's the only time I can think straight,

10:01.680 --> 10:04.411
you know, without the phones
and screens pestering me.

10:11.240 --> 10:12.765
You okay, ma'am? You look a little flushed.

10:12.880 --> 10:15.201
- I mentioned the moment in the car.
-(GASPS)

10:15.280 --> 10:17.089
- And?
- He had no idea what I was talking about.

10:17.160 --> 10:19.561
- No, you're kidding me.
- Yeah, I don't want to talk about this, okay?

10:19.680 --> 10:22.206
- I'm so humiliated.
- Okay, I understand. I understand.

10:22.280 --> 10:23.327
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

10:23.400 --> 10:25.687
No, you don't, Gary. You're a guy, okay?

10:25.760 --> 10:27.524
You can't have any idea
what I'm talking about.

10:27.600 --> 10:29.011
That's right, I am a guy. And Tom's a guy.

10:29.080 --> 10:30.445
Do you want me to talk to him
like guy on guy?

10:30.520 --> 10:31.646
No!

10:31.720 --> 10:34.530
You have to stop doing things
for me all the time, all right?

10:34.600 --> 10:36.682
Which reminds me, by the way,
I'm going commando

10:36.760 --> 10:38.250
-at tomorrow's pancake brunch.
- What?

10:38.320 --> 10:40.482
- No underwear?
- What?

10:41.040 --> 10:43.486
No. Jesus Christ.
Yeah, that'll win me the election.

10:43.560 --> 10:45.050
A nice shot of my beav.

10:45.120 --> 10:47.487
No, I want no prompting, okay?

10:47.560 --> 10:49.403
I'm going solo. No you, even.

10:50.240 --> 10:52.720
-(MUSIC PLAYING)
- DAN: That's right, Jamie. Dan Egan is back.

10:52.800 --> 10:54.086
Like denim and measles.

10:54.200 --> 10:56.362
-(LAUGHS)
- And, Lauren, you look beautiful.

10:56.440 --> 10:59.569
How do you keep that white wine so cold
looking that hot?

11:01.760 --> 11:02.727
Uh...

11:02.800 --> 11:03.881
(CLANKING)

11:03.960 --> 11:04.961
Everybody.

11:05.040 --> 11:09.125
So I just wanted to say thank you
for welcoming me back from exile.

11:09.200 --> 11:12.841
I can finally officially say
that Dan Egan has the all-clear.

11:12.920 --> 11:14.126
- Yeah. (LAUGHS)
-(CHEERING)

11:15.200 --> 11:16.167
Have fun. Enjoy the free bar.

11:16.240 --> 11:18.163
Yay. Free bar.

11:19.400 --> 11:22.768
Well, this is a soulless parade
of vanity and ambition.

11:22.840 --> 11:23.841
Isn't it great?

11:23.920 --> 11:26.002
- Sliders are good, too.
- Oh, I didn't see them.

11:26.120 --> 11:27.610
So listen, I invited Nicola Mortlock.

11:27.680 --> 11:29.125
Didn't you move in with her once?

11:29.200 --> 11:30.531
For like a month.

11:30.600 --> 11:32.329
She didn't like my untidiness
or my other girlfriends.

11:32.400 --> 11:35.722
Amy, I thought you might
be in a straitjacket drooling on meds.

11:35.840 --> 11:37.205
(BOTH LAUGH)

11:37.400 --> 11:39.050
I guess Mike McLintock was wrong.

11:39.120 --> 11:40.565
Yeah, is he ever right? (LAUGHS)

11:40.640 --> 11:42.722
I hope your vagina falls off.

11:43.440 --> 11:46.205
Amy. Jesus, what the fuck?

11:46.280 --> 11:48.169
- What?
- All right, how do I put this sensitively?

11:48.240 --> 11:49.924
Stop acting fucking nuts.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.286
- Yeah, I'm trying.
- All right, jeez.

11:51.360 --> 11:53.567
Look, the best way to get revenge
on these people

11:53.640 --> 11:56.211
is to use them to make a shitload of money.

11:56.280 --> 11:57.611
All right? Mark Twain said that.

11:57.680 --> 12:01.890
No, I hate D.C.
and it chews you up and it shits you out,

12:01.960 --> 12:04.884
and then you are left with nothing
but the night sweats and flashbacks!

12:04.960 --> 12:06.849
Come on, you love D.C.

12:06.920 --> 12:09.082
Find a way to just, sort of, release it.

12:09.160 --> 12:11.561
-(SCREAMING)
- Jesus Christ! Are...

12:11.640 --> 12:12.721
Stop it!

12:13.960 --> 12:15.371
Stop screaming.

12:15.440 --> 12:17.044
- That feels really good.
- I don't care.

12:17.120 --> 12:18.167
(SCREAMING)

12:18.240 --> 12:19.446
Hey!

12:20.000 --> 12:21.650
- This man bothering you?
- She's fine.

12:21.760 --> 12:23.922
- I swear, I...
- You need to stop speaking.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.206
- I asked the lady.
- Yer>, yep, yep-

12:25.280 --> 12:26.964
It's all good, Officer.

12:27.040 --> 12:29.008
- Maybe don't yell out like that.
- Mmm-hmm.

12:29.080 --> 12:31.048
- Makes people nervous.
- Yes. Yes, sir.

12:31.760 --> 12:35.526
Thank you. For this and
for your broader service.

12:37.840 --> 12:40.650
- That really felt better.
- All right, you need to calm down.

12:40.720 --> 12:42.961
Go to a spa, take a Pilates class.

12:43.040 --> 12:47.250
Go to a fucking church, find someone there
that has some Valium and take four of them.

12:49.120 --> 12:50.849
- JONAH: Hello.
- Oh, pleased to meet you.

12:50.960 --> 12:52.325
Ruth Forrester.

12:52.400 --> 12:54.880
Pleasure. Jonah Ryan.
This is my personal assistant, Richard Splett.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.684
- Splett?
- Splett.

12:56.760 --> 12:58.728
- Splett.
- Please have a seat.

12:58.840 --> 13:00.171
Oh, thank you.

13:01.440 --> 13:03.283
Uh, will the senator be joining us?

13:03.360 --> 13:07.365
Mr. Ryan, we asked you here today
with regard to a Mr. Theodore Sykes.

13:09.160 --> 13:10.161
Uh, Teddy.

13:10.240 --> 13:12.925
We're bringing a class action against him,

13:13.000 --> 13:14.490
and we'd like you to testify.

13:14.560 --> 13:18.610
We've all been the victims
of Teddy's inappropriate sexual behavior.

13:19.840 --> 13:21.330
Am I the only man that he...

13:21.400 --> 13:22.561
As far as we know.

13:22.640 --> 13:26.122
Okay, all right. Well, obviously
there has been some sort of mistake here

13:26.240 --> 13:30.609
because what happened between Teddy and I
was not consensual, obviously.

13:30.680 --> 13:32.489
There was the ball... The cupping...

13:32.560 --> 13:35.291
The grabbing or the clutching.

13:35.520 --> 13:37.204
There is no shame here, Jonah. Let it out.

13:37.280 --> 13:40.602
Oh, I understand there's no shame
because it was locker room tomfoolery

13:40.680 --> 13:41.920
and nothing more.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.490
You're saying you weren't assaulted?

13:43.560 --> 13:45.005
Sir, you don't have to answer that.

13:45.080 --> 13:46.525
- Oh, is this man your attorney?
- Uh,no.

13:46.600 --> 13:48.682
- Not technically.
- Let's go, right now.

13:48.760 --> 13:50.364
Teddy can't hurt you now.

13:50.440 --> 13:52.488
I'm not worried about Teddy.
I'm worried about you.

13:54.240 --> 13:57.289
Jesus fucking Christ. You all look like me.

13:58.280 --> 14:00.248
This is a nightmare.

14:00.360 --> 14:01.441
It's a fucking nightmare.

14:06.760 --> 14:08.205
And just so we're clear,

14:08.280 --> 14:10.647
at no point was this a job interview?

14:10.720 --> 14:13.610
- No.
- Okay. Okay.

14:15.280 --> 14:16.770
Well, that was unexpected.

14:16.840 --> 14:20.208
Yeah, I feel like I got felt up again,
but this time by the law.

14:20.280 --> 14:22.203
Just tell me what I'm doing.

14:22.280 --> 14:23.884
Well, you're dealing with
the emotional fallout of...

14:23.960 --> 14:25.371
- Today, Richard.
- Yeah.

14:25.440 --> 14:28.330
Well, you have a 4:30 meeting
with Congressman Skellern.

14:28.400 --> 14:30.243
Okay, that's in Georgetown, right?
So we should Uber?

14:30.320 --> 14:32.800
Oh, yeah, no.
Uber, that makes the most sense, sir.

14:35.120 --> 14:38.169
Richard, I don't look like
a middle-aged woman, do I?

14:40.120 --> 14:41.485
No, sir.

14:41.560 --> 14:45.007
Well, you do have that one purple shirt
that looks a bit blousy, but...

14:46.480 --> 14:48.721
- Oh, we got Donald coming in three minutes.
- Great.

14:56.320 --> 14:58.209
<i>I've got him. So who's next?</i>

14:58.280 --> 14:59.964
This is Congressman Cheever.

15:00.040 --> 15:01.246
- Do you remember anything about him?
- Yeah.

15:01.320 --> 15:03.163
He's got that big left ear,

15:03.240 --> 15:05.561
and he has a small majority,

15:05.640 --> 15:07.608
and he needs funding for infrastructure?

15:07.680 --> 15:11.924
Okay, really good. It's just it's his right ear
that's freakishly large.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.810
- No, his right, my left.
- A-ha, got it. Okay.

15:14.880 --> 15:17.531
Ma'am, this is the pancake brunch setup.

15:18.320 --> 15:20.561
- General holding area here.
- Yeah.

15:20.640 --> 15:23.450
Juices and coffees. Hot plates and griddles.

15:23.520 --> 15:25.443
Okay, the minute you see bubbles, you flip.

15:25.520 --> 15:29.286
No, you flip when you see holes.
Bubbles is too soon.

15:29.360 --> 15:30.646
Holes, not bubbles.

15:30.720 --> 15:32.324
Okay, <i>I</i> flip at bubbles, but...

15:32.400 --> 15:35.324
Fun fact. There are three kinds of syrup.

15:35.400 --> 15:37.129
Boysenberry, maple, and buttermilk.

15:37.200 --> 15:39.328
- SELINA: Uh-huh.
- Buttermilk is not a syrup.

15:40.520 --> 15:41.806
Okay, ma'am, what if you said this?

- SELINA: Yeah?

15:44.400 --> 15:45.401
- No.
- What's wrong...

15:45.480 --> 15:47.448
- Okay, I can't prep anymore, all right?
- Really?

15:47.520 --> 15:49.648
- I might vomit on Mike.
- Oh.

15:50.520 --> 15:52.887

Okay, let me get you a scopolamine patch.

15:54.560 --> 15:55.766
Fun fact.

15:55.840 --> 16:00.846
Scopolamine was first used as a truth serum
by the Czechoslovakian state police.

16:02.040 --> 16:03.485
How is that fun?

16:06.200 --> 16:07.486
- Mel?
- Tom.

16:07.560 --> 16:10.166
Did you lose a lot of weight
or did you get six inches taller?

16:10.280 --> 16:12.851
I think you look great.
Great height and weight.

- Madam President.
- Yes.

- Congressman Hausman.

No, ma'am, I have never had the honor.

- Okay.
- This is my wife Beatrice.

- Hello. How good to meet you.
- Hello.

16:30.200 --> 16:31.247
And I love your brooch.

16:31.320 --> 16:35.484
- Thank you. It's a honeybee. Bee for Beatrice.
- Oh.

16:35.560 --> 16:38.370
Fun fact about the honeybee.

16:38.440 --> 16:43.207
Do you know how much honey
a honeybee produces in its lifetime?

16:43.280 --> 16:45.601
- I do not.
- Well,

16:47.400 --> 16:49.687
it's either surprisingly little,

16:49.760 --> 16:52.081
or surprisingly a lot.

16:53.280 --> 16:55.282
Chatting, nodding. This is classic mingling.

16:55.480 --> 16:58.006
Yeah, but it's funeral mingling.

16:58.120 --> 16:59.451
Nobody's laughing.

17:15.599 --> 17:18.001
Did I tell you I slept in?

17:18.079 --> 17:20.242
- Wow.
- Mmm-hmm.

17:20.319 --> 17:22.641
Actually, I got up early,
but then I just stayed in bed

17:24.800 --> 17:27.484
That site has turned to shit. But anyway...

Oh, is that Paula Thorpe?

17:30.720 --> 17:32.927
- Did you lift your cucumber?
- Yeah.

Who's Paula Thorpe?

17:34.360 --> 17:36.408
- The chief of staff for Jensen.
- Fascinating.

17:36.480 --> 17:38.084
You are here to relax.

17:38.200 --> 17:40.202
Please, stop talking about work.

17:41.080 --> 17:42.570
Yeah, I know.

17:43.040 --> 17:45.042
It's so great.

17:47.160 --> 17:49.162
Wow, this music is so irritating.

Jesus, only you could be irritated
by gamma waves and a whale.

- I have been here, like...
- Seven minutes.

18:03.400 --> 18:05.402
...seven minutes. Yeah, it's plenty.

18:05.520 --> 18:07.010
Okay, so I'm going to see you at the office.

18:08.480 --> 18:11.086
but my father drove you
when you first ran for office.

18:11.160 --> 18:12.969
You're George Meredith's boy?

18:13.720 --> 18:15.882
How's he doing?
ls he still brewing his own beer?

- Yes, sir. Still doesn't taste any better.

made without cow's milk?

18:22.040 --> 18:25.123
Are you serious? You don't want milk or...

18:25.200 --> 18:26.440
No, it makes me gassy.

18:26.520 --> 18:28.682
Which, when you have
a bag instead of a bowel,

18:28.760 --> 18:31.047
-is not good.
- TOM: Bernie.

18:31.160 --> 18:32.446
How's the gut, my friend?

18:32.520 --> 18:35.444
Tolerable. Thanks for remembering.

There we go.

18:43.520 --> 18:47.002
Who's, uh... Who's achin' for some bacon?

18:47.800 --> 18:50.167
Got a very strong relationship
with Senator Lambert.

18:50.560 --> 18:52.210
Sure, and nobody wants
to ruin a good relationship.

18:52.640 --> 18:54.529
No, and Lambert kind of knows
Roger Furlong,

18:54.600 --> 18:56.204
who takes regular meetings with VP Doyle,

18:56.320 --> 18:58.322
who theoretically has access to POTUS.

18:58.400 --> 18:59.401
That's the chain.

18:59.480 --> 19:02.051
Look, you want a chain?
Here's the chain, okay?

19:02.160 --> 19:04.083
- Me...
- Me, the President of the United States.

19:04.160 --> 19:06.401
I have the trust of POTUS,

19:06.480 --> 19:08.960
and all of the senior members of her team.
Just...

19:09.040 --> 19:10.371
(PHONE RINGING)

19:12.720 --> 19:13.960
Hey, Amy-

19:14.040 --> 19:16.930
Yeah, good to hear from you.
Yeah, Sue just won't do.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.083
- Ben Cafferty.
- Sometimes I think she's actually dead.

19:20.160 --> 19:21.286
So did you hear about the hurricane?

19:21.360 --> 19:24.204
Oh, Ben, I'm sorry, I think I dialed by mistake.

19:24.280 --> 19:25.566
Hello?

19:26.120 --> 19:28.600
So, Paul, do we have your business?

19:29.120 --> 19:31.168
Be a lot cheaper for me
to steal your phone, but...

19:31.240 --> 19:32.526

19:32.600 --> 19:34.489
-...yeah, you do. You do, absolutely.
- SYDNEY: Excellent.

19:34.560 --> 19:35.971
- Okay, good.
- Hey, welcome aboard.

19:36.040 --> 19:37.724
- You're not going to regret this.
- Thanks so much.

19:38.120 --> 19:39.963
- All right.
- Very excited.

19:40.440 --> 19:41.441
Bye.

19:42.400 --> 19:44.880
Oh, boy, that was fucking amazing.

19:44.960 --> 19:46.883
- Thank you very much.
- Great work, Amy.

19:46.960 --> 19:48.883
You have my utmost admiration.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.843
- Thank you.
- Yeah, she's also got your client list.

19:50.960 --> 19:52.086
Wait, what do you mean?

19:52.160 --> 19:55.004
Don't worry about it. She's not taking
all your clients, just a couple.

19:55.080 --> 19:58.289
You know, Fycorps,
Killick & Company, Hemmings.

19:58.360 --> 20:00.442
No, no, no. That's my holy trinity.

20:00.520 --> 20:04.241
Those are my biggies.
Without those, all I got is my smallies.

20:04.320 --> 20:05.924
Well, spoils of war, handsome.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.446
You want top clients, be more like Amy.
Or better.

20:09.160 --> 20:10.446
You want to go ahead
and give her my parking space

20:10.560 --> 20:12.244
and my desk while you're at it?

20:12.320 --> 20:15.403
Now, listen, Dan,
I don't want to be unreasonable.

20:15.480 --> 20:16.925
Amy, do you want
his parking space and desk?

20:17.000 --> 20:18.001
Yes, please.

20:18.360 --> 20:19.486
GARY: <i>Are you okay?</i>

20:19.560 --> 20:21.164
- No.
- What's wrong?

20:21.280 --> 20:23.282
He's this pancake genius

20:23.360 --> 20:26.648
and I got lost in some sort of a bee anecdote.

20:26.720 --> 20:29.564
You listen to me. You are Beyoncé.

20:29.640 --> 20:30.880
He is backup booty.

20:31.400 --> 20:32.561

- Yeah?

20:32.640 --> 20:34.290
It's Ben.

20:35.400 --> 20:37.368
<i>- Hey,</i> what's going <i>on?
- The storm's happening.</i>

20:37.840 --> 20:40.923
Ma'am, you've got to get back to D.C.
faster than a speeding drunk.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.401
Is North Carolina about
to be blown off the map?

20:43.480 --> 20:45.562
Yeah, six hours till flying cow time.

20:45.680 --> 20:48.365
<i>This is a potential tragedy
that could be great for you.</i>

20:48.440 --> 20:49.441
Okay.

20:50.680 --> 20:51.806
And now the weather.

20:51.880 --> 20:54.247
Thank you. I feel very...

20:54.320 --> 20:57.210
Okay, we'll drop Tom back off in D.C., right?

20:57.280 --> 21:00.443
This is it. Hurricane's definitely going to hit.

21:00.520 --> 21:02.921
Everyone's gonna be coming
back from the campaign

21:03.000 --> 21:04.286
and this joint will bejumping again.

21:04.360 --> 21:06.840
You are really excited about that,
aren't you, Ben?

21:06.920 --> 21:09.127
Hell, yes. I mean, no offense meant, Sue,

21:09.200 --> 21:13.000
but when it's just you and me,
it's like it's just me.

21:15.000 --> 21:15.967
<i>MIKE: Okay, it's looking bad.</i>

21:16.040 --> 21:17.201
Both the National Weather Service

21:17.280 --> 21:19.044
and my app are saying this.

21:19.120 --> 21:21.885
Right, so we'll go to D.C.,
we'll wait for the storm to pass,

21:21.960 --> 21:23.086
and then we'll head to North Carolina.

21:23.160 --> 21:26.403
Or we could go there right now, before it hits.

21:26.480 --> 21:27.481
That's crazy.

21:29.160 --> 21:30.400
Soon as the hurricane has passed,

21:30.480 --> 21:32.721
you're right there with the people
in their hour of need.

21:32.800 --> 21:34.131
(MOUTHING) He's crazy.

21:35.360 --> 21:37.010
- I love that.
- Do you?

21:37.080 --> 21:39.367
That's the way you master a disaster.

21:39.440 --> 21:40.726
Hey, ma'am, I've got some issues here.

21:40.800 --> 21:44.122
It's a hurricane, and that's, like, killer wind.

21:44.240 --> 21:45.969
Okay, we're turning this plane around,

21:46.040 --> 21:47.451
we're headed to North Carolina.

21:51.120 --> 21:56.445
<i>A state of emergency in my state
would shut down travel, cost millions.</i>

21:56.520 --> 21:58.727
<i>Can we wait a few hours?</i>

21:58.800 --> 22:00.643
Well, we don't have a few hours.

22:00.720 --> 22:02.563
<i>Is that Senator James?</i>

22:03.120 --> 22:05.168
- Hi.
- Hi, Cecile.

22:05.240 --> 22:09.131
Either they have the contrast turned up to max
or you are looking fine.

22:09.240 --> 22:10.241
(LAUGHS)

22:10.320 --> 22:12.846
- Should we...
- Oh, yes, of course.

22:12.920 --> 22:14.331
Governor, I'm sure you'll understand,

22:14.400 --> 22:16.323
we have some issues of national security

22:16.400 --> 22:17.970
that have to be discussed.

22:19.520 --> 22:24.287
I have had it
with her Category 5 fucking snoot.

22:24.360 --> 22:27.603
And... She definitely can't hear us?

22:28.080 --> 22:31.289
- No.
- Maybe she can lip-read.

22:33.480 --> 22:34.925
Okay, um...

22:36.200 --> 22:37.850
Let's just swivel the chairs.

22:41.440 --> 22:43.204
Jesus Christ.

22:43.280 --> 22:44.361
She know that we can hear that?

22:44.440 --> 22:45.885
My guess would be no. No.

22:45.960 --> 22:48.122
- I got a text from Ben.
- What did he say?

22:49.400 --> 22:52.244
- What did he say?
- He says he can't hear anything.

22:52.320 --> 22:53.367
Just text him back.

22:53.440 --> 22:54.566
- Ma'am?
- Yeah.

22:54.640 --> 22:59.328
See, I think it would be unfair
on Senator O'Brien and his running mate

22:59.440 --> 23:01.044
if there were a travel lockdown

23:01.120 --> 23:03.441
because they would be stranded in Florida.

23:03.520 --> 23:07.127
They would not be able to visit
the disaster site like we could.

23:07.200 --> 23:10.090
Just throwing that into the barbecue sauce.

23:10.200 --> 23:11.201
Right.

23:14.120 --> 23:15.884
It doesn't work. The chair...

23:19.640 --> 23:21.563
Governor, it pains me to say this.

23:21.640 --> 23:27.204
I think we're gonna have to ground flights
despite your opinion on this matter.

23:27.280 --> 23:31.251
Cecile, if a state of emergency
were requested,

23:31.320 --> 23:35.609
that could be sweetened
by a light dusting of federal funds.

23:35.680 --> 23:39.844
<i>Okay, I've decided
to request a state of emergency.</i>

23:40.320 --> 23:42.004
Thank you, Governor.

23:43.560 --> 23:44.846
How about that?

23:46.080 --> 23:48.287
- Look at that. Put her here.
- Seemed to work.

23:48.360 --> 23:49.441
- You know what you are?
- What?

23:49.520 --> 23:51.921
A great choice that I made.

I don't want to look at standing trees.

24:08.840 --> 24:10.604
I mean, where is my storm?

24:10.680 --> 24:12.011
It veered south.

24:12.080 --> 24:14.048
- How?
- Barometric pressure.

24:14.120 --> 24:15.451
How about that app of yours, Mike?

24:16.160 --> 24:17.810
I think you better get
your money back on that one.

24:17.880 --> 24:19.564
It was actually free.

24:19.640 --> 24:22.723
I updated my software
and it just appeared on my screen.

24:22.800 --> 24:25.690
And I was like, "What is this thing?"
And I just picked it...

24:26.560 --> 24:27.607
Where's the storm headed now?

24:27.680 --> 24:29.011
- Florida.
- Florida.

24:29.080 --> 24:31.651
So O'Brien and Montez

24:31.720 --> 24:33.643
are gonna get the storm photos?
ls that what you're saying?

24:33.720 --> 24:36.530
This was definitely a good idea
when I pitched it.

24:36.600 --> 24:38.682
Well, I grounded flights,

24:38.760 --> 24:41.650
and I diverted federal funds
to the wrong state.

24:42.880 --> 24:45.121
I don't remember you pitching
that as a possibility, Tom.

24:45.200 --> 24:46.804
Sometimes you have to gamble.

24:46.920 --> 24:48.922
Unfortunately, our horse did not win.

24:49.000 --> 24:50.445
No, it certainly didn't.

24:50.520 --> 24:52.204
It fell at the first fence and it got shot.

24:52.280 --> 24:55.443
And now some French fucker's
got it in a baguette.

and this presidency, okay, Tom?

- Right. Mmm-hmm.
