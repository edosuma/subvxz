00:05.715 --> 00:10.177
"It has been proven
that 70% of people

00:10.386 --> 00:14.765
have fantasized
about having group sex,

00:14.849 --> 00:18.853
but only 50% have actually done so."

00:23.816 --> 00:26.569
The Game of Keys must be a joke.

00:27.278 --> 00:28.362
I know.

00:28.612 --> 00:31.449
Can you imagine having sex...

00:31.741 --> 00:33.993
with Gaby, or Bárbara,

00:34.493 --> 00:35.703
or Siena?

00:36.203 --> 00:39.874
And me having sex with Leo...

00:40.458 --> 00:41.834
Valentín...

00:42.585 --> 00:44.712
or Sergio? It's like...

00:45.087 --> 00:46.714
- Right.
- ...weird, right?

00:49.049 --> 00:51.093
Siena is crazy, don't you think?

00:52.553 --> 00:53.596
I think so.

00:55.639 --> 00:56.724
Too open-minded.

00:57.433 --> 00:58.768
And I think...

01:00.060 --> 01:01.437
Sergio too.

01:05.483 --> 01:08.027
Can you do it? You promised.

01:10.654 --> 01:13.032
Julieta! What happened?

01:13.115 --> 01:17.244
- I need to get out of here. Sorry.
- Are you coming back tomorrow?

01:22.416 --> 01:25.753
- Chata!
- Don't call her. Come here.

01:26.295 --> 01:27.671
What are you doing?

01:45.523 --> 01:48.567
Just relax.
We'll get a full-time nanny...

01:54.824 --> 01:56.325
Would you have sex with Leo?

01:57.451 --> 01:58.619
With Sergio, right?

02:01.247 --> 02:02.164
Maybe...

02:02.248 --> 02:04.333
- Come here.
- Take your shirt off.

02:25.771 --> 02:26.856
Are you sure?

02:30.901 --> 02:32.361
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

02:32.444 --> 02:34.029
Óscar, my God!

02:37.616 --> 02:41.287
THE GAME OF KEYS

02:46.250 --> 02:47.459
Good morning.

02:47.543 --> 02:50.337
- Good morning!
- Good morning!

02:50.421 --> 02:52.506
Hey, you sound so cheerful.

02:52.715 --> 02:53.924
It's a beautiful day.

02:55.259 --> 02:58.596
- And the scarf?
- It looks nice, doesn't it?

02:58.929 --> 03:01.515
- Let me see it.
- No, Bárbara.

03:04.685 --> 03:07.438
Have you been attacked
by a giant leech?

03:07.521 --> 03:08.689
No. It was Óscar.

03:08.981 --> 03:11.859
Last night, we had the best sex ever.

03:12.443 --> 03:14.111
- Really?
- Yes.

03:16.864 --> 03:19.575
Leo and I fucked three times.

03:19.783 --> 03:21.619
Not one or two, three.

03:21.702 --> 03:22.870
- Three?
- Three!

03:22.953 --> 03:25.623
- Sandra can hear you.
- She knows me.

03:26.415 --> 03:28.751
Hi, Sandra. Am I interrupting?

03:29.126 --> 03:30.252
Of course not!

03:30.628 --> 03:31.754
I couldn't help myself.

03:33.088 --> 03:36.342
I had to come over
and talk about last night.

03:36.550 --> 03:39.219
No kidding, you had wild sex.

03:40.179 --> 03:42.640
- Is it so obvious?
- You look radiant.

03:42.723 --> 03:43.557
You too?

03:43.557 --> 03:46.101
That fucking game
Siena suggested...

03:46.977 --> 03:48.729
turned us all on.

03:49.021 --> 03:52.024
Do you think
Sergio and Siena really do that,

03:52.149 --> 03:55.361
or did she just do it
to mess with us?

03:55.611 --> 03:58.656
- I'm so willing to stalk the girl.
- Let's see.

03:59.865 --> 04:03.160
- That fucking body can't be real.
- She's 20 years old, it's real.

04:03.243 --> 04:04.453
Good point.

04:04.912 --> 04:06.497
Have you seen where they are?

04:07.456 --> 04:10.250
I heard their vegan menu is tasty.

04:11.085 --> 04:13.837
I'm hungry.
Don't you want to go for lunch?

04:14.004 --> 04:16.924
- It's time for tequila.
- I think it's a good idea.

04:17.383 --> 04:18.384
Let's go.

04:18.676 --> 04:21.053
- See you, Sandra.
- Bye.

04:22.179 --> 04:23.806
Here is the appointment book.

04:25.891 --> 04:27.184
Are you sure it's here?

04:27.518 --> 04:28.811
Is this the place?

04:28.978 --> 04:30.396
There they are!

04:30.479 --> 04:33.816
- Act natural, you fools.
- She's with a girl exactly like her.

04:35.109 --> 04:37.695
Hi. Can we take that table?

04:38.153 --> 04:39.196
You did!

04:39.321 --> 04:41.365
- Of course not.
- I know you, Siena.

04:42.533 --> 04:43.617
Siena?

04:43.617 --> 04:46.078
- What a nice surprise!
- Hi.

04:46.161 --> 04:48.330
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

04:48.497 --> 04:50.499
What a coincidence, huh?

04:51.500 --> 04:53.293
Yes, totally.

04:54.628 --> 04:57.715
Gala, these are
Sergio's school friends.

04:57.798 --> 04:59.341
From last night's party.

05:01.552 --> 05:04.888
- Join us.
- We don't want to bother you.

05:04.972 --> 05:08.267
We had a great time last night,
right?

05:08.350 --> 05:12.187
Until I mentioned
The Game of Keys and you ran away.

05:15.399 --> 05:16.775
You didn't play?

05:16.984 --> 05:19.194
You have no idea what you're missing!

05:19.278 --> 05:20.446
They freaked out.

05:21.071 --> 05:22.865
No, we didn't.

05:23.198 --> 05:25.951
It was so unexpected.

05:26.118 --> 05:28.662
Do you guys play that game
on a regular basis?

05:28.704 --> 05:30.330
Is that normal?

05:32.791 --> 05:36.712
I know that women in their 40s aren't
as open about sex, but...

05:36.795 --> 05:39.381
Hold your horses!

05:39.673 --> 05:44.595
We 40-year-old ladies
have a very active sex life.

05:44.762 --> 05:47.056
And ladies in our mid-30s too.

05:47.264 --> 05:49.308
The 40s are the new 20s.

05:49.892 --> 05:53.062
- Okay. But always with the same guy.
- Good point.

05:54.813 --> 05:56.732
- Waiter!
- Don't you get bored?

05:58.609 --> 05:59.777
Sometimes.

06:00.819 --> 06:03.697
- Guys...
- Tequila, please.

06:03.781 --> 06:05.115
Lemonade for me.

06:05.199 --> 06:07.993
- No, a glass of wine for her.
- A glass of wine, then.

06:08.118 --> 06:11.121
Vanilla ice cream
isn't the only flavor.

06:11.997 --> 06:13.749
Cookies and Cream is an option.

06:16.960 --> 06:18.253
Caramel...

06:20.089 --> 06:21.090
Strawberry...

06:23.509 --> 06:25.302
You should try them all.

06:26.845 --> 06:29.098
- It's not that simple.
- But it is.

06:29.264 --> 06:32.059
Pick a man,
and I'll get his number for you.

06:32.101 --> 06:33.977
Look, Siena, honey.

06:34.144 --> 06:38.607
Any man would be happy
to give you his number.

06:38.899 --> 06:41.902
Adriana, it's not all about looks.

06:41.985 --> 06:43.737
It's about your mind power.

06:43.821 --> 06:46.448
See? I always tell you,
it's all in the mind.

06:47.282 --> 06:49.535
It's about mastering
your sexual power.

06:49.785 --> 06:50.661
Come on.

06:51.495 --> 06:54.248
- Pick a guy.
- Whoever you want.

06:54.414 --> 06:56.208
- Anybody?
- Just pick one.

06:56.959 --> 06:58.669
Cookies and Cream over there.

06:58.919 --> 07:01.338
Now, close your eyes.

07:02.589 --> 07:05.968
First, visualize him.
And repeat after me...

07:06.927 --> 07:08.929
"I want to fuck you."

07:12.141 --> 07:14.810
Say it, Adriana!
"I want to fuck you."

07:17.938 --> 07:20.232
- "I want to fuck you."
- No. Listen.

07:20.440 --> 07:21.942
Like you mean it!

07:22.151 --> 07:24.820
Imagine you're tearing
his clothes off.

07:24.903 --> 07:27.865
"I want to fuck you."

07:28.157 --> 07:31.410
"I want to fuck you."

07:32.369 --> 07:34.037
Very good.

07:34.413 --> 07:37.958
Now go over there and ask
his number without hesitation.

07:38.041 --> 07:40.377
Just do it.
Don't give it too much thought.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.045
- What?
- Just do it!

07:42.129 --> 07:44.590
- Come on!
- It's so embarrassing...

07:44.673 --> 07:45.841
Do it!

07:47.176 --> 07:49.386
- Is she really going to do it?
- She is.

07:51.763 --> 07:52.806
Hello.

07:52.890 --> 07:54.391
He seems to be a womanizer.

07:57.311 --> 08:00.022
- He's writing it down.
- Maybe he's gay.

08:00.105 --> 08:02.608
- He had his card ready.
- He is not gay.

08:05.986 --> 08:07.362
Good job!

08:08.071 --> 08:09.323
It felt great.

08:09.615 --> 08:11.366
Explain yourself.

08:11.617 --> 08:14.703
It was like I've regained
my self-control.

08:14.912 --> 08:17.623
I felt so self-confident, you know.

08:17.748 --> 08:19.750
Did you get excited?

08:20.459 --> 08:24.504
Ladies, you were taught
to repress your sex drive.

08:24.963 --> 08:27.674
But that's over.
It's time you break free.

08:27.758 --> 08:30.260
- Have new experiences.
- I'm ready for it!

08:30.344 --> 08:32.137
I have a question.

08:32.679 --> 08:35.474
Sergio doesn't mind
that you screw someone else?

08:35.515 --> 08:38.268
Don't you get jealous
when he fucks another girl?

08:39.061 --> 08:43.482
Jealousy gives
a special twist to the relationship.

08:44.233 --> 08:47.569
We have an open relationship,
but some rules apply.

08:48.320 --> 08:51.406
When he tells me his experiences
with other women,

08:51.490 --> 08:52.824
and I tell him mine...

08:52.950 --> 08:55.202
we have the best sex ever.

08:57.037 --> 08:58.121
You could try.

08:58.914 --> 09:02.960
Girls, there's a world
of sexual pleasure out there.

09:12.427 --> 09:15.722
Siena got me thinking.
She blew my mind.

09:16.932 --> 09:19.893
I'm not going to lie to you.
It sounds really tempting.

09:19.977 --> 09:23.397
Are you sure you would do that?

09:23.897 --> 09:25.315
I don't know.
I'm 35 years old,

09:25.399 --> 09:27.150
and I've only had sex
with my husband.

09:27.234 --> 09:28.610
I don't want to die like that.

09:29.361 --> 09:32.698
- We need to do something about that.
- Can we persuade them?

09:34.825 --> 09:38.745
"Honey, would you like
to have sex with other women?"

09:40.414 --> 09:42.332
No man could resist that.

09:42.457 --> 09:45.252
- I buy it.
- Good point.

09:48.922 --> 09:51.466
I hadn't heard that since school.

09:52.009 --> 09:53.927
Now we'll say,
"I want a shot with your husband."

09:55.679 --> 09:58.015
I need you to behave yourselves.
Smile, please.

09:58.098 --> 10:01.601
- Stop it.
- Honey, you smile too.

10:02.936 --> 10:04.855
We're having a nanny,
aren't you happy?

10:04.938 --> 10:06.606
I am. Let's do this.

10:07.733 --> 10:08.734
Hello!

10:08.859 --> 10:09.985
Come in, please.

10:11.778 --> 10:12.863
Hello.

10:13.572 --> 10:15.615
Hello. Come in, please.

10:18.493 --> 10:19.536
No way!

10:19.786 --> 10:22.998
Hello! Hey!
Come in, please.

10:23.081 --> 10:24.374
Drop that!

10:24.499 --> 10:25.625
Thanks.

10:48.815 --> 10:50.275
What were you doing?

10:50.359 --> 10:52.778
Nothing, baby. Sorry.

10:56.740 --> 10:57.908
What's up?

10:59.117 --> 11:00.410
How was your day?

11:00.494 --> 11:03.830
- You kept me up all night.
- You too.

11:04.206 --> 11:05.457
It was great.

11:07.250 --> 11:08.668
Can I have a sip?

11:11.296 --> 11:14.800
- Guess who we ran into at lunch?
- Mom?

11:16.843 --> 11:19.721
- No. Siena, Sergio's girlfriend.
- Really?

11:21.723 --> 11:24.935
Do you think I need to work out?
Do I look chubby?

11:25.018 --> 11:28.438
We had a very interesting
conversation with Siena.

11:30.315 --> 11:32.401
Tell me about it later.
I need to go to the bathroom.

11:37.906 --> 11:40.450
Kim Kardashian's app is unmatched.

11:40.534 --> 11:45.455
Just download it to your iPad,
enter your credit card details,

11:45.747 --> 11:50.210
and your kids can buy
clothes and shoes, take selfies.

11:50.544 --> 11:52.170
They'll be quiet for hours.

11:55.715 --> 11:59.511
- Kim Kardashian? Really?
- Stop it, Leo. Please.

11:59.803 --> 12:01.179
I need a drink.

12:01.930 --> 12:05.892
- Stop messing around. I'm serious.
- He started it again.

12:08.603 --> 12:09.896
I can't believe it.

12:10.355 --> 12:12.816
Darling, do your homework.

12:16.862 --> 12:19.156
I can't believe there isn't...

12:20.198 --> 12:24.161
one wise, honest,
and intelligent person...

12:24.578 --> 12:26.538
who can help us with the kids.

12:27.372 --> 12:28.373
Honestly.

12:28.707 --> 12:31.877
It seems we're doomed
to stay here

12:31.960 --> 12:33.462
for the rest of our days,

12:33.545 --> 12:36.214
confined to this house,
you and me dealing with the kids.

12:36.882 --> 12:38.592
Oh, don't say that, Bárbara.

12:44.890 --> 12:47.684
- Everything's going to be okay.
- I don't think so.

12:50.353 --> 12:51.897
That silence isn't usual.

12:53.440 --> 12:55.859
Fuck! Luly left the front door open!

12:57.110 --> 12:58.236
Fidel!

12:59.029 --> 13:00.864
- Emiliano. Are you okay?
- Yes.

13:01.406 --> 13:04.701
- What are you doing?
- The assignment the lady told us.

13:05.076 --> 13:06.953
- What lady?
- Her.

13:07.412 --> 13:10.582
Good morning. My name is
Carmen Sofía Margarita García,

13:10.665 --> 13:12.584
and I came for the job
as a full-time nanny.

13:13.418 --> 13:15.587
Nice to meet you. Take a seat.

13:15.670 --> 13:17.380
I'd rather stand
if it's okay with you.

13:18.423 --> 13:19.799
Here's my résumé.

13:20.091 --> 13:20.842
Thanks.

13:20.926 --> 13:24.262
I have a degree in Child Psychology
from the University of Zaragoza.

13:24.554 --> 13:28.016
I'm fluent in three languages,
and trained as a first-aider.

13:31.436 --> 13:34.064
Well, yes. You seem highly qualified.

13:35.732 --> 13:37.067
So what brings you to Mexico?

13:37.150 --> 13:40.487
It doesn't sound right that
a highly qualified person like you

13:40.612 --> 13:44.157
is looking for a job as a nanny.
Don't you think?

13:45.158 --> 13:48.703
Carmen, excuse us.
I need to talk to my husband.

13:48.787 --> 13:49.955
Thank you.

13:52.123 --> 13:53.583
- What?
- What's gotten into you?

13:53.708 --> 13:56.503
- We can't hire her.
- Why not?

13:56.586 --> 13:58.004
We don't need a Spaniard lady

13:58.088 --> 14:00.048
to teach us
how to raise our children.

14:02.092 --> 14:03.301
She's already colonizing them.

14:03.385 --> 14:07.013
Colonizing them?
They are doing their homework, Leo.

14:07.472 --> 14:10.100
What are you going to do
when they dance flamenco

14:10.183 --> 14:13.979
- and go to bullfights?
- I'll be so happy!

14:14.187 --> 14:17.107
My Aztec forefathers are rolling over
in their graves, Bárbara.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.442
We've already talked about it, Leo.

14:19.901 --> 14:23.363
You weren't going to put
your ideologies before your family.

14:25.699 --> 14:26.658
Okay.

14:30.704 --> 14:31.663
Carmen?

14:32.539 --> 14:34.040
The job is yours.

14:37.210 --> 14:40.880
I'm convinced dogs have souls.

14:42.007 --> 14:44.759
In those huge black eyes

14:44.968 --> 14:47.554
I can see more kindness
than in most people I know.

14:49.139 --> 14:54.060
You care so much for that puppy,
I'm sure you'll be a great mother.

14:54.144 --> 14:56.813
Mom, please. Don't start with that.

14:57.355 --> 15:00.609
Valentín, what's the harm
in talking about grandchildren?

15:00.734 --> 15:05.155
Sorry to say so,
but I'll be a terrific grandmother.

15:05.280 --> 15:06.156
You will.

15:06.489 --> 15:08.658
Sure you will.
And when we have kids,

15:08.742 --> 15:11.620
we're going to be
very grateful for you.

15:11.703 --> 15:15.248
Honestly, I don't understand
your generation.

15:15.582 --> 15:20.211
It's great to raise cats and dogs,
and post it on social media.

15:20.879 --> 15:22.547
But, Valentín...

15:23.423 --> 15:24.758
What are you waiting for?

15:25.759 --> 15:27.594
Look at your wife.

15:28.178 --> 15:29.346
She is beautiful.

15:30.096 --> 15:32.432
Much more beautiful than you deserve.

15:33.099 --> 15:35.477
- Son of a bitch!
- Ernesto, please.

15:35.560 --> 15:37.854
And you have all my money too.

15:38.396 --> 15:40.565
But you don't want to spend it
on having kids.

15:40.690 --> 15:42.567
Look, the Lombardos' seed

15:42.609 --> 15:44.819
has always been
very effective. Right?

15:46.196 --> 15:50.950
But I don't know, maybe you need
one of those tests to check...

15:51.534 --> 15:54.663
- your sperm...
- Ernesto, there's no need.

15:55.038 --> 15:56.206
It was a suggestion.

15:56.748 --> 15:58.291
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

16:00.293 --> 16:02.879
Well, there's no problem
with the Lombardos' seed.

16:03.129 --> 16:05.590
Valentín and I are
healthy enough

16:05.674 --> 16:06.883
to have babies.

16:07.425 --> 16:11.346
And don't think we aren't trying.

16:12.055 --> 16:15.308
Valentín is perfectly fine.

16:15.642 --> 16:16.976
Gaby is tremendous.

16:17.519 --> 16:22.649
I propose a toast
to the Lombardos' seed.

16:23.149 --> 16:26.069
- Come on, love. To your seed.
- Cheers, honey.

16:26.736 --> 16:28.071
Cheers.

16:28.405 --> 16:30.281
Cheers.

16:32.325 --> 16:35.203
My boss loved my ideas
for the new marketing campaign.

16:35.537 --> 16:38.373
- You know, the toilet paper account.
- I know.

16:39.916 --> 16:41.376
We're almost done.

16:42.168 --> 16:44.003
The pitch is next week.

16:44.462 --> 16:46.548
That's great, hon. I'm happy for you.

16:50.301 --> 16:52.762
You should get rid of those slippers.

16:52.887 --> 16:56.391
It was a gift from Mica.
Look what she just gave me.

16:57.726 --> 17:01.479
I would never get rid of them.
Otherwise we couldn't do our dance.

17:11.489 --> 17:14.534
Did I tell you
we ran into Siena at lunch?

17:15.201 --> 17:16.661
You mentioned it.

17:16.828 --> 17:22.333
She insisted on explaining
how The Game of Keys works.

17:23.209 --> 17:25.128
The girl's obsessed with sex,
isn't she?

17:25.211 --> 17:26.045
I guess.

17:26.713 --> 17:27.881
But I don't know.

17:29.174 --> 17:33.178
I mean, she made a very good point.

17:33.344 --> 17:36.806
Why should we have
only one sexual partner

17:36.890 --> 17:38.224
for the rest of our lives?

17:39.058 --> 17:42.061
I think
it might be worth considering.

17:42.228 --> 17:45.190
I mean, I think it might be worth...

17:46.024 --> 17:48.693
Sure. It'd be super cool.

17:49.402 --> 17:54.407
I think we should all move in
with Gaby and Valentín.

17:54.449 --> 17:56.075
Like a community.

17:56.785 --> 17:59.996
We could go around naked
having sex all day.

18:01.289 --> 18:02.499
I'm not joking.

18:03.458 --> 18:05.502
- I want to try, Óscar.
- Why?

18:07.045 --> 18:08.713
Because I feel like we're stuck.

18:09.422 --> 18:12.217
Stuck? Wait a second!

18:12.759 --> 18:13.635
Listen.

18:13.718 --> 18:17.764
I love you as much
as when we got married.

18:17.972 --> 18:19.599
And I love you too.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.060
That's not the point.

18:23.561 --> 18:26.481
I think we need a change.

18:27.106 --> 18:28.942
Do something new.

18:30.568 --> 18:31.903
Make something happen.

18:32.237 --> 18:35.949
And you think having sex with
other guys is the change you need?

18:36.574 --> 18:37.408
Honey.

18:40.662 --> 18:43.039
We've been married
since we finished school.

18:44.457 --> 18:48.545
Have you never considered
having sex with another girl?

18:50.338 --> 18:54.008
- I would never cheat on you.
- It wouldn't be cheating.

18:54.676 --> 18:56.135
That's the whole point.

18:58.805 --> 19:00.056
I guess.

19:08.523 --> 19:12.026
Are you sure
you wouldn't be angry or jealous

19:12.110 --> 19:14.404
if I had sex
with one of your friends?

19:14.571 --> 19:15.572
I'm sure.

19:16.906 --> 19:18.533
We are together in this.

19:20.285 --> 19:23.830
The Lombardos' seed! What the fuck!

19:25.123 --> 19:27.083
I don't know
how you managed not to laugh.

19:28.334 --> 19:31.546
Dad refers to me as if I were
a reproduction machine.

19:31.629 --> 19:34.132
I know nothing about
the Lombardos' seed,

19:34.591 --> 19:37.844
but I agree you'd make
quite a reproduction machine.

19:38.720 --> 19:40.221
Your mom is right.

19:40.847 --> 19:45.184
Our children would be beautiful,
intelligent, cultured...

19:45.435 --> 19:46.394
Cool.

19:46.895 --> 19:47.854
Gaby?

19:49.731 --> 19:50.773
You too?

19:52.191 --> 19:53.109
What?

19:54.027 --> 19:55.695
Do you have any idea
how much work

19:55.778 --> 19:57.071
it takes to raise a child?

19:58.072 --> 19:59.532
See Leo and Bárbara.

20:00.658 --> 20:02.869
We wouldn't have time for us.

20:02.869 --> 20:04.787
We couldn't do everything
we've planned.

20:04.954 --> 20:07.373
Sweetheart,
we aren't Bárbara and Leo.

20:08.875 --> 20:11.794
You and I are very blessed,
we could hire help.

20:11.920 --> 20:13.671
Nannies, drivers.

20:14.505 --> 20:17.133
We could travel the world
with our children.

20:17.717 --> 20:20.219
It'd be quite an adventure.

20:20.261 --> 20:23.598
I know! And I'm sure
you'd the best mom ever.

20:23.640 --> 20:25.475
But it isn't the right time yet.

20:30.480 --> 20:32.357
The day will come, I promise.

20:32.523 --> 20:35.568
You've been saying that
for six years.

20:44.035 --> 20:46.829
What do you think
about the game Siena suggested?

20:48.790 --> 20:51.834
The Game of Keys?
It sounds interesting, doesn't it?

20:53.044 --> 20:55.129
You, Valentín, be willing to play?

20:55.713 --> 20:56.756
Why not?

20:59.592 --> 21:02.095
It's like a bomb
about to blow, Bárbara!

21:02.512 --> 21:03.513
Why would it be?

21:03.888 --> 21:07.892
If we all agree, what's the problem?

21:07.934 --> 21:09.644
Sounds great in theory,

21:09.727 --> 21:12.480
but once you have sex
with someone else,

21:12.605 --> 21:15.274
it's hard not to have
feelings for them.

21:16.109 --> 21:19.612
When you cross those boundaries,
there's no turning back.

21:19.612 --> 21:22.323
Pushing boundaries is what we need.

21:22.615 --> 21:25.618
It would be
our own sexual revolution.

21:30.790 --> 21:32.000
Leo.

21:33.751 --> 21:34.752
I think...

21:35.461 --> 21:40.383
it's time to stand
against the establishment.

21:42.385 --> 21:44.012
This isn't working.

21:45.263 --> 21:46.556
We need to do something.

22:00.695 --> 22:04.532
- One more round, please.
- Just give me a moment!

22:04.615 --> 22:05.700
Come on.

22:06.159 --> 22:08.244
- Give me five minutes.
- Don't be a bore.

22:08.578 --> 22:10.496
- Give me a break.
- Please.

22:11.330 --> 22:13.166
Just five minutes.

22:16.335 --> 22:19.464
Just five minutes, okay? That's all.

22:19.756 --> 22:21.299
Okay. Five minutes.

22:22.216 --> 22:25.511
- Meanwhile, I'll warm up.
- For what?

22:25.762 --> 22:28.264
- Haven't you warmed up enough?
- For the next round.

22:31.893 --> 22:32.894
Hey?

22:33.436 --> 22:34.937
I liked all your friends.

22:35.563 --> 22:36.439
Did you?

22:36.522 --> 22:39.442
Did you know Óscar
was behind the viral advertising

22:39.525 --> 22:42.111
of the Seven Dwarfs
and their toilets in the woods?

22:42.278 --> 22:43.780
Yes, I knew.

22:45.448 --> 22:47.408
I didn't think it could interest you.

22:47.742 --> 22:48.659
And Leo...

22:49.243 --> 22:51.370
I think he's an interesting guy.

22:52.163 --> 22:54.916
I see you really liked my friends.

22:56.375 --> 22:58.795
- Would you fuck them?
- Of course I would.

22:59.295 --> 23:01.380
They are all sexy daddies.

23:02.381 --> 23:05.343
One, it's funny you've called them
sexy daddies.

23:05.510 --> 23:08.054
Two, they aren't
as open-minded as we are.

23:08.513 --> 23:11.641
And three, they will never agree
to your game.

23:11.849 --> 23:14.185
- I bet 500 pesos that they will.
- They won't.

23:14.185 --> 23:17.355
They're going to play
before the end of the month.

23:17.396 --> 23:18.898
Oh, come on!

23:19.148 --> 23:21.400
- Okay, fine. 500 pesos.
- 500 pesos.

23:21.442 --> 23:25.696
- The easiest 500 pesos of my life.
- I'll beat you, honey.

23:26.280 --> 23:29.617
- Come here, sweetie.
- Are you recovered?

23:29.742 --> 23:32.620
- Not really, but I can try.
- Sergio, come on!

23:46.968 --> 23:49.887
ARE YOU READY
FOR THE FIRST ROUND?

23:49.971 --> 23:51.973
OUR HOME TONIGHT?

23:52.056 --> 23:55.434
GENTLEMEN, BRING YOUR KEYS

23:56.686 --> 23:58.813
You woke up pretty early.

23:59.772 --> 24:01.691
- You have work to do?
- No.

24:02.567 --> 24:07.613
But I'm planning
our first official Game of Keys.

24:09.115 --> 24:10.158
Tonight?

24:10.867 --> 24:12.451
- Here?
- Yes.

24:15.204 --> 24:16.539
You are out of your mind.

24:16.706 --> 24:18.291
We decided it yesterday, Óscar.

24:18.916 --> 24:24.297
No, we decided that it might be
a good idea to do it someday.

24:24.881 --> 24:27.383
Not tonight in our own home.

24:28.342 --> 24:30.803
If we don't do it now,
we're never going to.

24:32.722 --> 24:34.390
What about Mica?

24:35.016 --> 24:37.185
We're not having a wild party
with her around.

24:37.268 --> 24:38.811
Of course not!

24:39.312 --> 24:42.690
Don't worry, I'll take care of it.

24:45.067 --> 24:46.277
You got the message?

24:48.821 --> 24:49.822
I did.

24:51.574 --> 24:53.951
Are we sure we want to play?

24:54.577 --> 24:55.661
We are.

24:57.663 --> 24:59.582
Ask her if she needs anything.

24:59.999 --> 25:02.752
- Come on, let's go.
- Take her out, please.

25:04.045 --> 25:05.504
Go.

25:06.964 --> 25:07.965
Here.

25:08.174 --> 25:09.258
Thanks, honey.

25:10.593 --> 25:12.511
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

25:18.893 --> 25:21.103
I got the message.
Shall we confirm we'll go?

25:21.187 --> 25:22.438
WE'LL BE THERE

25:22.521 --> 25:25.107
One... two...

25:26.484 --> 25:27.610
Sent.

25:33.449 --> 25:37.411
You're overreacting.
That's not going to happen.

25:40.873 --> 25:44.252
- One of your lady friends?
- I don't know. Read it.

25:50.800 --> 25:53.678
- You owe me 500 pesos.
- What do you mean?

25:56.639 --> 25:59.892
- No way!
- See? Told you!

26:04.230 --> 26:07.858
Let the Game of Keys begin!

26:18.077 --> 26:19.078
Hey.

26:23.207 --> 26:24.208
Hey.

26:24.792 --> 26:27.253
What are you doing tonight?

26:27.878 --> 26:29.463
- Do you have plans?
- No.

26:30.423 --> 26:33.092
Maybe I'll check who's online later.

26:33.968 --> 26:35.177
Paola and Vanessa?

26:36.178 --> 26:38.347
Why don't you go to the movies?
It's on me!

26:39.307 --> 26:41.100
You can sleep over at Vanessa's.

26:41.183 --> 26:43.352
Her parents are out of town,
aren't they?

26:47.481 --> 26:49.734
Why are you insisting
on getting me out of the house?

26:49.900 --> 26:53.154
I just want you to have a good time.

26:56.741 --> 26:58.451
You're not a little girl anymore.

27:01.871 --> 27:03.289
Listen, Mica.

27:03.956 --> 27:05.666
The thing is...

27:06.876 --> 27:10.880
Your dad and I need some time
to hang out.

27:11.005 --> 27:13.215
- I mean...
- No, you didn't say that.

27:13.299 --> 27:16.719
It's natural.
It's obvious that we need to have...

27:16.802 --> 27:18.971
Don't say another word.

27:21.015 --> 27:22.099
Gross!

27:23.476 --> 27:24.810
What's gotten into you?

27:28.314 --> 27:29.440
Done.

27:36.906 --> 27:40.117
- Hi!
- Where did you get that car?

27:40.659 --> 27:43.704
Am I taking you in a cab
to your first Game of Keys in Mexico?

27:43.788 --> 27:45.164
Of course not! Get in.

27:49.210 --> 27:50.920
Thank you.

27:52.546 --> 27:53.714
Isn't it nice?

27:54.131 --> 27:56.008
Aren't you supposed to be broke?

27:56.092 --> 27:58.427
You still owe me 500 pesos!

27:58.719 --> 28:00.888
You're only broke
if you think you're broke.

28:01.138 --> 28:02.556
Come on. It's getting late.

28:03.599 --> 28:05.017
Hit the gas!

28:32.128 --> 28:33.129
Adriana?

28:33.796 --> 28:35.214
Do you like how it looks?

28:36.048 --> 28:38.467
- It looks nice. Can we talk?
- What?

28:39.218 --> 28:41.011
- Can we talk?
- What's wrong?

28:43.764 --> 28:46.225
- I don't think I can do this.
- What?

28:47.977 --> 28:49.770
Everyone's on their way.

28:50.187 --> 28:53.357
I know. But I didn't have time
to process this.

28:55.234 --> 28:57.111
What if...

28:57.736 --> 29:00.865
you have sex with some other guy
and fall in love?

29:01.115 --> 29:04.577
Sweetheart, no.
No, don't say that.

29:05.161 --> 29:06.745
That's not going to happen.

29:07.580 --> 29:10.082
You are the world to me...

29:16.005 --> 29:17.131
But...

29:17.798 --> 29:20.009
We won't do it if you don't want to.

29:20.342 --> 29:21.427
It's your choice.

29:27.933 --> 29:28.851
Okay.

29:32.438 --> 29:34.732
- I'll get it.
- No, I'll get it.

29:34.815 --> 29:35.858
Okay.

29:37.776 --> 29:39.278
Okay, go.

29:50.831 --> 29:55.878
Pre-Hispanic cuisine is
more complicated than French cuisine.

29:56.462 --> 29:57.379
I think.

30:01.467 --> 30:03.093
Mezcal, finally.

30:06.472 --> 30:08.891
It's been really hot
these last few days, hasn't it?

30:10.601 --> 30:12.728
You never know in this town.

30:13.062 --> 30:14.688
It's cold, it's hot.

30:15.314 --> 30:18.275
You wear your winter clothes
in the morning, and then it pours.

30:18.442 --> 30:19.652
Relax, guys!

30:20.277 --> 30:22.196
We'll have a great time.

30:23.906 --> 30:28.661
But before we start, it's important
that we set four ground rules.

30:29.662 --> 30:30.996
Rule number one.

30:31.705 --> 30:34.792
This is obvious. Safe sex.

30:35.334 --> 30:36.502
Agree?

30:38.045 --> 30:39.713
Rule number two.

30:41.340 --> 30:45.261
There should be no sex
beyond the game.

30:47.304 --> 30:49.306
Rule number three.

30:50.891 --> 30:52.685
Everything must be consensual.

30:55.187 --> 30:58.983
Rule number four.
You can't fall for anyone.

31:01.527 --> 31:03.696
This is strictly sexual.

31:05.197 --> 31:06.824
Do we all agree?

31:08.534 --> 31:11.704
Now, gentlemen. Your keys, please.

31:11.829 --> 31:16.250
Because tonight,
ladies get to choose.

31:17.042 --> 31:18.210
Okay...
