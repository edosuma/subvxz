WELL, THEN, SEE.

23:01.713 --> 23:03.090
IT SAYS LET US GO.

23:03.173 --> 23:06.093
IT'S A MATTER OF INTERPRETATION.

24:08.780 --> 24:11.575
WHAT THE BLAZES
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

24:11.658 --> 24:15.203
I WAS AT MARDI GRAS,
WHERE I WAS CROWNED KING WIENIE

24:15.287 --> 24:17.539
WHEN I SAW IN MY NIPPERS
OF THE FUTURE

24:17.622 --> 24:19.207
THE TROUBLE YOU WOULD HAVE.

24:19.291 --> 24:21.168
I DON'T UNDERSTAND, BIG MAN.

24:21.251 --> 24:23.378

24:23.461 --> 24:25.130
WELL, SEE YOU LATER.

24:26.339 --> 24:27.465

FROM ALL THIS.

24:29.968 --> 24:31.678
I SURE DID.

24:31.761 --> 24:34.055
ALL THAT'S SHINY
IS NOT SAUSAGE.

24:36.808 --> 24:38.602
