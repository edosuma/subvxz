00:01.000 --> 00:04.960
<i>- Does everybody know what time it is?
- Tool Time!</i>

00:05.071 --> 00:07.835
That's right. Binford Tools
is proud to present...

00:07.941 --> 00:10.466
Tim "The Tool Man" Taylor!

00:17.484 --> 00:20.214
Thank you. Thank you, everybody.

00:21.721 --> 00:25.213
<i>Welcome to Tool Time.
I am Tim "The Tool Man" Taylor.</i>

00:25.291 --> 00:28.749
And you all know my assistant,
Hugh Hefty.

00:29.863 --> 00:34.493
All week long we've been showing you
things that make mers lives easier.

00:34.567 --> 00:38.663
Yesterday it was wives with laryngitis.

00:41.174 --> 00:43.642
<i>But today it's our Tool Time salute...</i>

00:43.710 --> 00:45.678
<i>To remote control.</i>

00:45.779 --> 00:49.146
<i>The first television remote
was connected to the TV with a wire.</i>

00:49.249 --> 00:51.809
<i>- It was invented in 1950.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.</i>

00:51.918 --> 00:56.981
Al, my dad had a wireless remote control
that was voice-activated in 1950.

00:57.057 --> 01:01.790
<i>- Tim, that's impossible.
- No, it's not. It was called Mom.</i>

01:02.529 --> 01:06.659
<i>Ladies, write to Tim Taylor,
care of Tool Time, PO Box 327...</i>

01:06.733 --> 01:09.566
A lot of popular toys these days
are remote control,

01:09.636 --> 01:13.595
cars, boats, planes, even submarines,
but here's my favorite one here.

01:13.673 --> 01:16.836
- What would that be?
- The company calls it a flying saucer.

01:16.943 --> 01:19.275
It looks more like a blimp to me.

01:19.345 --> 01:23.213
I can't believe you'd be interested
in this. It's quiet, simple, slow.

01:23.283 --> 01:25.410
Just like you, Al.

01:27.220 --> 01:30.587
I've installed a little spy camera
on it. Watch this.

01:35.295 --> 01:39.823
Hey, what do you think this is,
the teachers' lounge? Put out that butt.

01:44.471 --> 01:46.439
Oh, the humanity!

01:48.808 --> 01:50.537
Can we get back to the show now?

01:50.610 --> 01:53.943
We wouldn't want to muddy up
the show with entertainment.

01:54.013 --> 01:56.777
OK, now we get to the ultimate
in remote control.

01:56.850 --> 01:59.683
- What would that be?
- It's called virtual reality.

01:59.752 --> 02:03.119
You become the remote control.
You become part of the action.

02:03.223 --> 02:06.522
- What kind of action?
- You name it. Car racing, football...

02:06.593 --> 02:10.757
How about basketball? How would you like
to go one-on-one with Grant Hill?

02:10.830 --> 02:12.889
- That would be great!
- Slip these on.

02:12.966 --> 02:16.595
These are virtual-reality
optical sensing devices.

02:16.669 --> 02:21.697
The circuitry must be incredibly small.
They look like regular sunglasses.

02:26.846 --> 02:31.306
Now, slip your hand into this.
This is a tactile sensory device.

02:31.384 --> 02:35.878
Well, this looks just like the work
glove that disappeared out of my locker.

02:39.359 --> 02:43.090
When I turn on the machine, there
might be a bright light, so watch out.

02:45.198 --> 02:49.635
- Now, turn around.
- Oh, my gosh! It's Grant Hill!

02:51.804 --> 02:53.772
Man!

02:57.076 --> 03:00.842
It's like... it's like he's right here.
I can almost touch him.

03:00.947 --> 03:03.575
Come on, Round Man.
Show me what you got.

03:06.452 --> 03:09.910
You really have to dribble it. Yeah!

03:10.890 --> 03:14.053
All right. I'll just give him
my patented jump shot.

03:14.160 --> 03:16.219
I guess flannel men can't jump.

03:18.831 --> 03:22.198
Man! Well, I don't have to jump.
I can just blow by you.

03:22.268 --> 03:25.726
You're a virtual reality.

03:25.805 --> 03:27.864
I can just blow right by...

03:29.943 --> 03:33.401
- Wow, that hurts.
- Well, it didn't really hurt, did it?

03:33.479 --> 03:35.447
It was just virtual pain.

03:37.000 --> 03:43.074

04:33.239 --> 04:35.207
Aah!

04:36.576 --> 04:38.703
Did I scare you, Wilson?

04:38.778 --> 04:42.441
Well, not you.
It's that flying baked potato.

04:42.515 --> 04:46.076
Well, the manufacturer says
it looks like an alien spaceship.

04:46.152 --> 04:49.121
I think it looks like
a big Jiffy Pop container.

04:49.222 --> 04:53.522
I tend to agree. A real spaceship would
have some form of internal propulsion.

04:53.593 --> 04:56.357
- Should look more like a saucer.
- An iridescent glow.

04:56.429 --> 05:00.798
- A low hum.
- 26 diamond-shaped windows in a row.

05:00.867 --> 05:03.529
<i>The flying saucer
out of Forbidden Planet</i>

05:03.603 --> 05:05.332
<i>or The Day The Earth Stood Still?.</i>

05:05.405 --> 05:09.068
- I wasrt talking about a movie.
- What were you talking about?

05:09.142 --> 05:13.511
- Well, nothing. Oh, look at the rain.
- Wait a minute. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:13.579 --> 05:16.514
Were you talking about a... a real UFO?

05:16.582 --> 05:20.245
- Maybe.
- Have you seen a real UFO?

05:20.320 --> 05:23.153
Maybe.

05:23.222 --> 05:26.487
- Come on. It's just us out here.
- Maybe.

05:28.795 --> 05:31.628
You know, Tim,
I've never told anybody this,

05:31.698 --> 05:34.166
but one night when I was living
with my parents

05:34.233 --> 05:37.464
outside the Turkish city
of Cappadocia...

05:39.639 --> 05:43.006
...I saw an alien craft land.

05:47.280 --> 05:49.942
Did you see little green men
come out of it?

05:50.016 --> 05:52.985
No, no, no, no, no, no.
These men were bluish-gray.

05:54.754 --> 05:59.623
Assuming they were men. I didn't see
any sexually distinguishing features.

05:59.692 --> 06:01.660
Well, you had just met.

06:05.932 --> 06:09.766
Oh, I tell you, it was an amazing thing.
I'll never forget it.

06:09.836 --> 06:13.567
Well, how'd the night go?
Some cocktails and a quick probe?

06:15.041 --> 06:18.067
Oh, Tim!
I never should've told you about this.

06:18.144 --> 06:22.376
No, no, no, no. I'm sorry, Wilson.
I understand completely what happened.

06:22.448 --> 06:25.178
Have you been inside
shellacking all day?

06:25.251 --> 06:28.152
If you don't get enough ventilation,
it can really...

06:28.221 --> 06:31.156
I do that, I think I'm Aquaman.

06:34.894 --> 06:36.020
What are those?

06:36.095 --> 06:38.825
In case I don't get
that soccer scholarship,

06:38.898 --> 06:41.867
I need to figure out
a great place to go to college.

06:41.934 --> 06:43.902
The University of Hawaii.

06:45.338 --> 06:47.306
CancÃºn College.

06:49.142 --> 06:51.110
Virgin Islands State?

06:52.545 --> 06:55.571
You going to college or on a cruise?

06:55.648 --> 06:58.583
All these schools
have great academic programs.

06:58.651 --> 07:02.985
Is that why you divided them
into beach schools and ski schools?

07:03.890 --> 07:06.654
- Hi, guys.
- What's up, Mom?

07:06.759 --> 07:08.727
Are you looking at school catalogs?

07:08.795 --> 07:12.162
Yeah, I think it's about time
I get serious about college.

07:12.231 --> 07:15.758
It's nice to see you motivated
about continuing your education.

07:15.835 --> 07:18.702
Randy, you could use
those same catalogs.

07:18.771 --> 07:21.103
Or I could call my travel agent.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.877
Still looking at these weird schools?

07:25.945 --> 07:28.914
Why don't you check into
Iwo Jima Community College?

07:31.951 --> 07:35.182
- I had a weird discussion with Wilson.
- What's new with him?

07:35.254 --> 07:37.814
He claims he had an encounter
with space aliens.

07:37.924 --> 07:39.687
He saw these blue-green creatures

07:39.792 --> 07:43.319
when he stayed with his folks
in a Turkish town, Cappuccino.

07:43.396 --> 07:47.958
Were they covered in foam
and sprinkled with cinnamon?

07:48.768 --> 07:51.931
He said he had an encounter
with extraterrestrials.

07:52.004 --> 07:55.872
Or he dipped into the festival wine
a bit early.

07:55.942 --> 07:58.433
Well, I wouldn't dismiss him
so quickly, guys.

07:58.511 --> 08:00.877
I mean, there has been
lots of documentation

08:00.980 --> 08:03.346
about peoples' encounters with aliens.

08:03.416 --> 08:05.577
You think there's a real possibility?

08:05.651 --> 08:08.142
There's some
really respected institutions

08:08.221 --> 08:11.588
that have entire departments
devoted to paranormal studies.

08:11.691 --> 08:15.957
Ooh, yeah.
The department of ooo-eee-ooo.

08:17.330 --> 08:19.298
With all the money
spent on research,

08:19.398 --> 08:21.958
they don't have proof alien life exists.

08:22.068 --> 08:23.831
They don't have proof it doesn't.

08:23.936 --> 08:27.667
Well, I guess we know who are
the sane members of this family.

08:27.740 --> 08:29.708
Don't lump me in with you.

08:32.578 --> 08:35.240
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Timmy.

08:35.313 --> 08:38.477
Harry called me, said my saw blade
was in. Where is Harry?

08:38.551 --> 08:42.111
- He's home with a nasty bug.
- What, a parasite?

08:42.188 --> 08:44.748
Close. Dolores.

08:45.858 --> 08:48.224
He's home with the flu.
A reciprocating saw?

08:48.327 --> 08:50.693
- Yeah, it was.
- I know where he put it.

08:50.796 --> 08:52.764
Hand me a cup, will you?

08:54.667 --> 08:57.158
Do you guys
think that alien life exists?

08:57.236 --> 09:01.764
I hope so. That way I'd have a chance
with another species.

09:01.841 --> 09:04.537
Yeah. I can see it now.

09:04.610 --> 09:10.173
You're gently holding
her eight-fingered hand.

09:10.283 --> 09:14.049
While you stare into that one big eye.

09:14.120 --> 09:17.487
And try to figure out
which set of lips to kiss.

09:18.457 --> 09:22.484
I know you're messing with me,
but I'm still getting a little hot.

09:25.598 --> 09:28.726
I'm talking about extraterrestrials.

09:28.801 --> 09:31.269
Why would a guy need more than two?

09:37.009 --> 09:40.172
Here's your saw. What's so funny?

09:40.279 --> 09:43.146
Wilson claims
he saw an extraterrestrial.

09:43.215 --> 09:45.877
Where? His family reunion?

09:45.952 --> 09:48.648
Extraterrestrial.
Like an alien, spaceships...

09:52.959 --> 09:55.689
- Well, hi-ho, fellas.
- Hey.

09:55.761 --> 09:57.592
- Hey, Wilson.
- Not a word.

09:58.664 --> 10:01.690
You know, Al, I need
some one-half-inch carriage bolts.

10:01.767 --> 10:04.634
- They're right over here on aisle 21.
- Mm-hm.

10:04.704 --> 10:08.606
Would those carriage bolts be for you
or are you taking 'em to your leader?

10:09.976 --> 10:12.206
- My leader?
- Yeah, you know...

10:16.649 --> 10:20.016
Did you tell them? I thought
this was just between the two of us.

10:20.119 --> 10:23.486
It's just between the five of us.
It'll go no further than that.

10:23.589 --> 10:27.821
- Did you tell Jill and the boys?
- All right, the nine of us.

10:27.893 --> 10:32.660
We're sorry, Wilson.
We didn't mean to alienate you.

10:32.732 --> 10:34.063
Marty, come on!

10:34.133 --> 10:37.261
I didn't come to this hardware store
to be ridiculed.

10:37.336 --> 10:41.432
Try Larry's Hardware.
Today's their "going out of orbit" sale.

10:41.507 --> 10:43.805
- Hey, guys!
- Well, Tim, thanks a lot.

10:43.876 --> 10:46.902
You have made me
the laughingstock of the neighborhood.

10:46.979 --> 10:49.311
I only told nine people, Wilson. Honest.

10:49.382 --> 10:51.145
- Here's your mail, Al.
- Thanks.

10:51.250 --> 10:52.717
- Hey, Milton.
- Hey, guys.

10:52.785 --> 10:58.280
Oh, Wilson, something for you, too.
A sweepstakes letter from Ed McMartian.

11:11.370 --> 11:15.329
Come on out, Wilson, and talk to me.
Come on. I know you're in there.

11:16.542 --> 11:20.273
At least come out and wave
at my little spy cam, Wilson.

11:27.119 --> 11:29.883
<i>You'll enjoy surfing,
kayaking and volleyball</i>

11:29.989 --> 11:32.287
<i>on our beautiful
white sugar sand beaches.</i>

11:32.358 --> 11:35.885
Wow, that looks great.
What is this, the Leisure Channel?

11:35.961 --> 11:40.660
No. It's a recruiting video
from the University of Maui.

11:40.733 --> 11:42.997
I don't think you're going to a college

11:43.069 --> 11:46.596
that's nicer than where
I spent my honeymoon.

11:46.672 --> 11:48.640
Arert you supposed to be studying?

11:48.741 --> 11:50.902
<i>While you're overlooking the Pacific,</i>

11:50.976 --> 11:55.072
<i>you could earn your PhD in marine
biology, art history or psychology.</i>

11:55.147 --> 11:57.115
Hello!

12:02.254 --> 12:06.623
Well, now every time I try to talk
to Wilson, he just shoots me down.

12:06.726 --> 12:10.253
Wilsors not talking to you
'cause you really hurt his feelings.

12:10.329 --> 12:14.425
I didn't mean to hurt his feelings.
It's just that alien stuff is so crazy.

12:14.500 --> 12:17.264
You see? That's the attitude
that he's reacting to.

12:17.336 --> 12:21.773
Whenever you don't understand
something, you just make fun of it.

12:21.841 --> 12:25.208
I do that even when I understand things.

12:25.277 --> 12:27.404
You're gonna have to learn to pull back.

12:27.480 --> 12:31.348
When a thought enters your mind, it
doesn't have to shoot out of your mouth.

12:31.417 --> 12:33.476
If I could change things, I would.

12:33.552 --> 12:36.578
Because all I've done now
is alienate the one person

12:36.655 --> 12:39.488
whose opinion really matters to me.

12:44.263 --> 12:47.596
- What about me?
- What about you?

12:47.666 --> 12:51.625
If you want Wilson to know that you care
about what's important to him,

12:51.737 --> 12:53.705
you're gonna have to make a gesture.

12:53.806 --> 12:57.503
How about..."Please!"?

12:57.576 --> 13:01.205
No. It works for me, but...

13:01.280 --> 13:05.740
You should do some research on the stuff
that Wilsors been talking about.

13:05.818 --> 13:09.481
You'll be well-informed and it'll show
that you take him seriously.

13:09.555 --> 13:14.492
I gotta have an intelligent conversation
about stuff that doesn't exist.

13:14.560 --> 13:16.721
- Right.
- Government cover-ups.

13:16.796 --> 13:20.129
Secret bases in the desert
that no one knows what goes on there.

13:20.199 --> 13:22.963
And big crop circles.
What's that all about?

13:23.068 --> 13:27.437
And big balloon-headed things that
look like they ate too many almonds.

13:27.506 --> 13:29.872
Nighttime abductions, big bright lights,

13:29.942 --> 13:34.242
and ships that scream in
and always get people with no teeth...

13:37.216 --> 13:39.582
Wow. Look at that girl.

13:39.685 --> 13:42.916
Better hope Mom doesn't catch you
looking at this magazine.

13:42.988 --> 13:47.220
No, this is a college catalog
I got today. It's from Tahiti Tech.

13:49.461 --> 13:52.624
Man, they let a student
walk around campus like that?

13:52.698 --> 13:54.666
She's the dean.

13:56.035 --> 13:58.162
- OK. What do we do?
- We're all booted up.

13:58.237 --> 14:03.004
Access the server, double-click on the
browser icon, and we're surfing the Net.

14:03.108 --> 14:06.407
OK. 20 years ago no one
would've understood that sentence,

14:06.478 --> 14:09.038
and today it's just me.

14:10.416 --> 14:14.477
- I start typing in the subject here?
- Yeah. Try UFO.

14:14.553 --> 14:18.319
Good idea.
Probably a few websites, huh?

14:22.761 --> 14:26.128
There's 103,000 websites.

14:26.198 --> 14:28.758
I guess Wilsors
not the only one seeing things.

14:28.834 --> 14:31.530
There's a lot of nut cases out there.

14:31.604 --> 14:33.765
See what they're saying
in the chat room.

14:33.873 --> 14:36.774
A UFO chat room. I bet it's padded.

14:42.248 --> 14:46.742
Unbelievable. People all over the world
have documented sightings like Wilsors.

14:46.819 --> 14:51.256
Come on, Dad. Don't tell me you're
starting to take this stuff seriously.

14:52.091 --> 14:54.059
It's not easy to ignore, you know?

14:54.159 --> 14:56.127
There's even government documents

14:56.228 --> 14:59.129
that show strange phenomena
they just can't refute.

14:59.198 --> 15:01.962
No, Dad. Come on.
Crop circles, Roswell cover-up.

15:02.067 --> 15:06.504
And, you know, Elvis is alive
and running a laundromat in Cleveland.

15:06.572 --> 15:11.009
Uh-uh. It's a doughnut shop in Dayton.

15:12.845 --> 15:17.179
You know, I'm surprised at you.
I mean, how can a sane, rational...

15:17.249 --> 15:19.217
Oh, never mind.

15:19.318 --> 15:23.186
I'm telling you, there's strange things
out there we can't explain.

15:29.762 --> 15:34.290
- Like what was that?
- It's Mark going to the bathroom.

15:34.366 --> 15:38.325
- He goes the same time every night.
- OK, OK. That explains the noise.

15:38.404 --> 15:42.568
But can you explain why a bladder
that young is on such a rigid schedule?

16:03.128 --> 16:05.688
I saw an alien craft...
craft... craft...

16:05.798 --> 16:09.256
There's no proof
aliens exist... exist... exist...

16:09.335 --> 16:13.169
Entire departments devoted
to paranormal studies... studies...

16:13.238 --> 16:16.469
The aliens were
bluish-gray... gray... gray...

16:16.542 --> 16:19.705
Anyone for cappuccino...
cappuccino... cappuccino...?

16:23.248 --> 16:26.706
- I found the file, Jilly.
- What have you come up with, Taylor?

16:27.853 --> 16:30.583
According to my underground sources,

16:30.656 --> 16:34.217
this is the triangulated center
of all alien activity

16:34.293 --> 16:36.261
in the western hemisphere.

16:36.362 --> 16:38.660
Easily explained by swamp gas,

16:38.731 --> 16:41.222
weather balloons,
mass delusional hysteria.

16:41.300 --> 16:44.064
Why do you respond
with scientific mumbo-jumbo?

16:44.169 --> 16:48.128
Everything you say is pie-in-the-sky,
paranormal saucer-head idiocy.

16:50.843 --> 16:52.936
The truth is out there.

16:53.012 --> 16:56.277
No. You're the one that's out there.

17:00.552 --> 17:02.520
Oh!

17:06.425 --> 17:09.690
Hold up, Jilly. I can't explain it,

17:09.762 --> 17:13.027
but I sense the presence of an alien.

17:13.098 --> 17:16.261
Taylor, have you noticed
these aliens seem to eschew

17:16.367 --> 17:18.836
well-lit, ventilated housing?

17:18.904 --> 17:20.872
They what?

17:20.973 --> 17:22.941
Eschew.

17:23.842 --> 17:25.605
Eschew.

17:25.676 --> 17:27.645
Gesundheit.

17:33.585 --> 17:37.749
- Right there. Right there. Right there.
- What is it?

17:37.823 --> 17:40.348
The alien we've been looking for
all our lives.

17:40.426 --> 17:42.986
How can we be sure it's not human?

17:43.095 --> 17:45.063
It's too small.

17:45.164 --> 17:50.124
Notice... the delicate,
hairless features.

17:53.138 --> 17:54.867
Oh, my God!

18:01.080 --> 18:03.048
Put a shirt on!

18:05.984 --> 18:07.952
<i>Hi, and welcome back to Tool Time.</i>

18:08.053 --> 18:12.683
Professional roofer Tony Bruschetta
is talking about harnessing and safety.

18:12.758 --> 18:15.283
Tony's gonna show us
two different systems

18:15.360 --> 18:18.329
which allow you to anchor yourself
to the roof.

18:20.766 --> 18:23.701
There's actually a third system
which allows Al's mom

18:23.769 --> 18:26.738
to anchor herself
to a frost-free Frigidaire.

18:29.608 --> 18:32.475
Tony's family's been
in the business for 65 years.

18:32.544 --> 18:35.035
You must've logged
a lot of hours on the roof.

18:35.114 --> 18:38.743
Does it ever get lonely at the top?

18:38.817 --> 18:42.150
Well, you know, I can't complain.
I've got a roof over my head.

18:42.221 --> 18:45.657
- Uh-huh.
- No, wait, it's under my feet!

18:47.326 --> 18:50.784
It's a 30-minute show, fellas.

18:50.863 --> 18:52.558
I'll do the jokes.

18:52.631 --> 18:56.362
Actually, you ever noticed anything
odd in the sky? Unusual sights?

18:56.435 --> 18:58.403
Tim, not with the aliens again.

18:58.504 --> 19:00.836
UFOs, spaceships, that kind of stuff.

19:00.906 --> 19:05.002
The audience wants to talk about roofs,
not about people from outer space.

19:05.077 --> 19:07.136
You're awfully defensive about this.

19:07.212 --> 19:09.976
- There are no aliens.
- How do you know?

19:10.082 --> 19:12.414
Hey, maybe he's hiding something.

19:12.484 --> 19:15.009
Maybe he's hiding the fact
that he's an alien.

19:15.087 --> 19:18.750
I am not now nor have I ever been
an alien!

19:18.824 --> 19:23.921
Oh, yeah? What do the first two letters
of "alien" spell, Al?

19:23.996 --> 19:25.964
Ooh...

19:28.367 --> 19:32.201
And your mother's quite large.
Perhaps she's the mothership.

19:35.240 --> 19:38.073
What you got, Wilson?
Some rare Amazonian plant

19:38.143 --> 19:41.169
you crossbred
with, like, a North African variety?

19:41.246 --> 19:44.113
They're petunias. Good day, Tim.

19:44.183 --> 19:47.346
I was wondering if maybe
that spaceship you saw

19:47.419 --> 19:50.980
is the same kind
that the army found in Roswell.

19:51.089 --> 19:53.319
What do you know of Roswell?

19:53.392 --> 19:57.158
I know that a lot of people think
a flying saucer crash-landed there.

19:57.229 --> 19:59.595
I also know about Sheffield, England.

19:59.698 --> 20:02.326
In 1962 there was
a spectacular sighting there.

20:02.401 --> 20:04.961
- And in Mexico City, 198...
- '83.

20:05.037 --> 20:06.595
Yeah.

20:06.705 --> 20:09.139
With the difficult time you gave me,

20:09.208 --> 20:13.144
I'm surprised you're taking such
an interest in unexplained phenomena.

20:13.212 --> 20:17.376
I figured if a real intelligent guy
like you was interested in the stuff,

20:17.449 --> 20:20.816
maybe I should learn more about it,
so I went on the Internet

20:20.919 --> 20:24.685
and I found out a lot of people
have had experiences just like yours,

20:24.790 --> 20:28.351
and not just people
with a shellac dependency.

20:29.228 --> 20:30.889
Well, that's true.

20:30.963 --> 20:33.796
I shouldn't have made fun
of your beliefs.

20:33.865 --> 20:35.526
I appreciate you saying that.

20:35.601 --> 20:38.729
Maybe you could relay that
to the guys at the hardware store.

20:38.804 --> 20:41.671
Oh, I'll do that.
I'll tell all the guys down there

20:41.740 --> 20:44.573
and the mailman
and the guy at the gas company.

20:47.813 --> 20:51.078
So, with all your newfound knowledge,
are you a believer?

20:51.149 --> 20:55.108
I wouldn't say that.
I'm just open to more possibilities now.

20:55.187 --> 20:57.655
And I'm having
some really strange dreams.

20:57.723 --> 21:01.454
About government conspiracies,
FBI agents in trench coats,

21:01.526 --> 21:04.461
that you are out there?

21:04.529 --> 21:07.089
You know about my dream?

21:07.165 --> 21:11.465
Are we having some sort of
mind-melding kumbayatic experience?

21:11.536 --> 21:14.505
No. Jill told me.

21:16.908 --> 21:18.068
I didn't tell her.

21:28.020 --> 21:30.750
You said you think Jordars an alien?

21:30.822 --> 21:33.985
How else could he jump that high?

21:34.059 --> 21:36.823
- Shaquille?
- You call that an earth name?

21:39.097 --> 21:41.622
All right. Dennis Rodman?

21:41.700 --> 21:44.828
I'll give you that one.

21:44.903 --> 21:47.929
Look, Tim, these guys
don't know I'm onto them,

21:48.006 --> 21:51.066
so I'd appreciate it
if you don't say anything.

21:51.143 --> 21:55.512
All right. All right. All right.
How do I know you're not an alien?

21:57.249 --> 21:59.581
I never said I wasrt.

22:01.253 --> 22:04.017
But you're working,
so you must have a green card.

22:05.390 --> 22:07.449
More bluish-gray.
