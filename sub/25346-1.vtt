00:49.841 --> 00:52.677
I looked up Gay,
and the population is 89 people.

00:52.761 --> 00:54.429
-That's big.
-And their big--

00:54.637 --> 00:55.472
Big?

00:55.555 --> 00:57.891
I used to live in a town

-We actually have a special treat, guys.

01:01.519 --> 01:03.980

-Yes!

01:04.064 --> 01:05.857
I haven't done a lady in years.

01:05.940 --> 01:09.110
-We've never done a lady.
-I have never done a lady.

01:09.360 --> 01:10.779
Oh, I just got the joke.

Our lady this week, Tammye.

02:06.334 --> 02:10.004
She's 5'1" and... [squeaks] pounds
'cause you don't tell a lady's weight.

02:10.088 --> 02:11.422
-All right.
-Correct.

02:11.506 --> 02:12.715
[laughs] That's me.

She is nominated by Gene,

02:15.426 --> 02:17.387
-her friend and neighbor.
-Cute.

02:17.470 --> 02:21.266
If the world was full of Tammyes,
we wouldn't have problems.

02:21.349 --> 02:23.768
[Tammye]
God has given me a precious gift.

02:23.852 --> 02:28.148
I'm on this planet not for myself,
but for the betterment of humanity.

02:28.231 --> 02:30.775
She is sweet. She's loving. She's caring.

02:31.359 --> 02:34.988
She's actually more sweet, loving, caring
for others than she is for herself.

02:35.071 --> 02:36.614
Miss Tammye's a very busy woman.

02:36.698 --> 02:38.783
[Tammye] I have three children
and a husband.

02:38.867 --> 02:40.785
-How's school going?
-It's good.

02:40.869 --> 02:42.036
[Gene] She loves church.

02:42.120 --> 02:44.455
[Tammye] I hug every person
that walks into church.

02:44.539 --> 02:46.749
She's a teacher
over in Coweta County.

02:46.833 --> 02:50.044
I also do Hospital Homebound
for children who are sick.

02:50.128 --> 02:53.798
I visit them after school,
and then I make my own way home,

02:53.882 --> 02:57.719
and grade papers,
and I try to fix something quick to eat.

02:57.802 --> 03:00.597
Something fast,
a fast meal that's fast to cook.

03:01.264 --> 03:02.515
[man] Do you eat fast food?

03:04.475 --> 03:06.686
I eat fast foods. [chuckles]

03:07.020 --> 03:10.690
Instead of getting help with her home,
Tammye hopes the Fab 5 will help

03:10.773 --> 03:13.026
-with the community center.
-All right.

03:13.109 --> 03:17.155
This weekend, Tammye's church is throwing
their annual Homecoming Service.

03:17.238 --> 03:19.324
-Do y'all know what that is?
-I do.

03:19.407 --> 03:22.410
[Gene] Each year, most local country
churches have the homecoming,

03:22.493 --> 03:27.206
and they're asking the ones that haven't
been in a while to come and socialize,

03:27.290 --> 03:30.001
and get encouraged
to start attending again.

03:30.084 --> 03:32.420
Her passion for the community
runs in her family.

03:32.545 --> 03:35.465
Aw, Tammye's grandmother
was a sharecropper,

03:35.548 --> 03:39.677
and she co-founded this church
at her kitchen table over 50 years ago.

03:39.761 --> 03:42.222
Back when "gay" just meant happy.

03:42.972 --> 03:45.725
Miss Tammye, uh,
was diagnosed with cancer.

03:46.559 --> 03:49.062
Then her sister and her mother
all at the same time.

03:49.145 --> 03:51.731
And her mother unfortunately
didn't survive.

03:53.149 --> 03:55.151
[Tammye] This is the first homecoming--

03:56.736 --> 03:57.612
Excuse me.

03:58.238 --> 03:59.280
--without my mom.

04:00.198 --> 04:03.243
So, that's gonna be bittersweet.

04:04.577 --> 04:09.207
Tammye's son, Myles, he's 22,
and he just moved back home from Atlanta.

04:09.290 --> 04:12.085
He does not feel comfortable
going back to their church,

04:12.168 --> 04:15.255
because he doesn't feel welcome anymore
after coming out as gay.

04:15.338 --> 04:17.257
Or even the homecoming, for that matter.

04:17.340 --> 04:19.759
The Church is what I feel alienated by,
not God.

04:19.842 --> 04:22.053
I feel loved and accepted
by God and Jesus.

04:22.136 --> 04:25.723
It's the politics of the Church
is what made me feel not welcome.

04:25.807 --> 04:30.061
That was people saying, "I love you.
I just don't accept your lifestyle."

04:30.144 --> 04:31.646
[Bobby] I can relate to that.

04:31.729 --> 04:35.275
Not everyone in the Church is that way.
And not all churches are that way.

04:35.358 --> 04:38.528
I love the Church, and I have loved
every experience.

04:38.611 --> 04:40.446
I have always used my strength

04:40.530 --> 04:43.366
to encourage them
to see in a different light.

04:43.449 --> 04:46.202
-That's beautiful.
-Let's be open-minded.

04:46.286 --> 04:50.707
So, our mission this week is to help
Tammye go from hot mess to Sunday best.

04:50.790 --> 04:52.125
[all] Yeah!

05:03.136 --> 05:04.762
That is a bright red truck.

05:04.846 --> 05:06.014
[Bobby] Let's find Gene.

05:07.515 --> 05:09.225
-Come on.
-Got it.

05:09.309 --> 05:13.438
"Notice: No firearms--" Really?
They gotta put a sign saying "no guns"?

05:14.188 --> 05:16.733
-Gene?
-Oh, my God, he looks like my dad.

05:16.816 --> 05:18.818
-Nice to meet you.
-Hey, I'm Bobby.

05:18.901 --> 05:20.653
It's a pleasure to meet you.

05:20.737 --> 05:23.698
-You have awesome boots.
-[Tan] That's a crisp hat, too.

05:23.781 --> 05:25.950
-You're a snazzy dresser.
-[Gene] Thank you.

05:26.034 --> 05:28.870
-So, why nominate Tammye?
-Tammye's a sweet lady.

05:28.953 --> 05:33.124
Been through a lot in the last year,
so it's been a rough ride for her.

05:33.207 --> 05:35.585
You're helping with the community space?

05:35.668 --> 05:40.048
Yeah, we started this last year,
but they only had so much funds available.

05:40.131 --> 05:44.635
So, um, we got it up and dried in,
and, uh, it's been sitting here.

05:44.719 --> 05:48.139
This was a vision of theirs years ago,
was to have this community center.

05:48.222 --> 05:51.184
What are they planning
on using this building for?

05:51.267 --> 05:52.310
I think their goal

05:52.393 --> 05:55.772
is to have it to where they can
have one, two days a week

05:55.897 --> 05:58.816
where elderly people--
Even not members of the church.

05:58.900 --> 06:02.820
But they can come here and maybe
have a meal, socialize and visit.

06:03.196 --> 06:04.530
-Nice.
-I love that.

06:04.614 --> 06:07.241
I think they're hoping
to maybe start a day care here.

06:07.325 --> 06:09.994
-Oh, nice.
-[Gene] Some of the young ladies here

06:10.078 --> 06:13.039
and single moms that are struggling
that can't afford day care.

06:13.122 --> 06:15.416
-Maybe they can start a program in here.
-Nice.

06:15.500 --> 06:18.086
-We could have bingo, too, I don't know.
-[laughing]

06:18.169 --> 06:20.671
-Can you take us to Tammye?
-Be glad to.

06:20.755 --> 06:22.673
-Yes!
-Let's get out of here.

06:22.757 --> 06:25.510
-Come on.
-Wanna take a look inside the church?

06:25.593 --> 06:26.552
[Jonathan] Yeah.

-Thank you.

-I'm good.
-You're good.

06:32.016 --> 06:33.851
-Wow, so much red.
-[Gene] Go ahead.

06:34.519 --> 06:36.229
-You all right? Wanna stay?
-Mm-hm.

06:36.312 --> 06:37.939
-You sure?
-[Antoni] Is that a tree?

06:38.314 --> 06:40.441
-It's so--
-[Karamo singing]

06:41.025 --> 06:43.778
Y'all gonna do all the singing,
I'm gonna do the preaching.

06:43.861 --> 06:47.156
-It's beautiful. It's cute.
-[Gene] It's been here a long time.

06:47.240 --> 06:50.243
In my experience with religion
and religious people,

06:50.326 --> 06:51.452
I've just been judged.

06:51.536 --> 06:54.122
You look like the gay that's scared
they're gonna burn

06:54.205 --> 06:56.374
-[laughs]
-when they cross the door.

06:56.582 --> 07:00.378
-Okay. Can I ride with you, Gene? Yeah.
-Sure. Who wants to ride with me?

07:00.461 --> 07:01.921
-Wanna ride with us, too?
-Sure.

07:02.004 --> 07:04.340
[Bobby] I don't like being involved
with the Church,

07:04.423 --> 07:07.301
because there's so much hate
against gays

07:07.385 --> 07:10.012
and fights against our just basic rights

07:10.096 --> 07:13.224
that I have a hard time
making peace with it.

07:16.018 --> 07:17.979
[Tan] Do you have Muslims in this town?

07:18.062 --> 07:20.982
-I'm assuming not many in Gay.
-Where does he or she live?

07:21.065 --> 07:21.899
Yeah.

07:21.983 --> 07:25.153
I'm pretty sure we're thin
on gays and Muslims.

07:25.236 --> 07:26.070
Okay.

07:27.363 --> 07:30.408
Picture it. Click on Netflix
and turn on that Bob Ross collection

07:30.491 --> 07:31.868
they have on there now.

07:31.951 --> 07:32.952
So peaceful.

07:33.035 --> 07:35.913
You're taking a little gander.
You see a little side street.

07:35.997 --> 07:38.791
Let me go down there.
You come upon a little horse farm.

07:38.875 --> 07:43.045
See little birds living up there,
and some hay over there.

07:43.129 --> 07:45.047
That's Tammye's house. Gorgeous.

07:45.131 --> 07:47.049
[Tan] Had a nice drive?
Isn't it beautiful?

07:47.133 --> 07:49.010
[Bobby] Yeah. Reminds me of home.

07:49.093 --> 07:52.513
Oh, I love a good front porch
with rocking chairs.

07:54.140 --> 07:55.183
[Gene] Miss Tammye.

07:56.267 --> 07:57.393
Miss Tammye, you here?

07:57.477 --> 07:58.352
-Hey.
-Hey.

07:58.436 --> 08:01.439
-Hi, good-looking. How're you doing?
-Come here. Let me see you.

08:01.522 --> 08:02.815
[all] Hi.

08:02.899 --> 08:06.444
-Oh, my God.
-I wanna introduce you to the Fabulous 5.

08:06.527 --> 08:08.738
-Oh, my God.
-[Gene] This is Miss Tammye.

08:08.821 --> 08:10.948
-You guys are fabulous.
-How are you?

08:11.032 --> 08:13.618
This is one sweet lady.
You'll never meet one finer.

08:13.701 --> 08:16.120
-Hey, it's been great.
-Thanks, Gene.

08:16.204 --> 08:19.415
-Mm, I smell something frying.
-You better come in here.

08:19.499 --> 08:22.793
I'm walking slowly.
I can't contain my excitement.

08:22.877 --> 08:25.755
[Tammye] Can't live in Georgia
without fried green tomatoes.

08:25.838 --> 08:27.924
-Come on, y'all try one.
-[Tan] Thank you.

08:28.007 --> 08:29.967
-Mm. Those are good.
-[Tammye] Sinful.

08:30.051 --> 08:31.219
This is sinful.

08:31.677 --> 08:34.263
Ooh, wow.
Do we call you Miss Tammye or Tammye?

08:34.347 --> 08:35.223
Call me Mama.

08:35.306 --> 08:36.474
-[Tan] Mama.
-Oh, yeah.

08:36.557 --> 08:37.517
Mama Tammye.

08:37.600 --> 08:39.227
-Yeah.
-I'll be Mama Tammye.

08:39.310 --> 08:42.063
-I love that.
-I'm your mom away from home.

08:42.146 --> 08:43.439
-I love that.
-Yeah.

08:43.523 --> 08:46.442
I'm so far away from my mom,
so I will take that.

08:46.526 --> 08:48.736
We just saw the community center.

08:48.819 --> 08:51.280
-We saw the church. Amazing.
-Yes.

08:51.364 --> 08:53.950
-You guys raised all that money.
-[Tammye] Bless my heart.

08:54.033 --> 08:57.036
You made this building.
What's on your vision board?

08:57.578 --> 08:58.663
Oh, my vision.

08:58.955 --> 09:02.458
I want it to be a place
that we can feed people

09:02.542 --> 09:04.126
spiritually and naturally,

09:04.210 --> 09:08.631
where everyone that walks in the door
can feel love.

09:08.714 --> 09:10.216
-Yeah!
-All right!

09:10.299 --> 09:13.511
-Yay, guys.
-Can we see the rest of the house?

09:13.761 --> 09:15.263
-Yes, we'd love to.
-Yes.

09:16.472 --> 09:18.891
This is Myles' room. Coming in.

09:19.559 --> 09:20.768
Oh, my gosh.

09:20.851 --> 09:22.853
-[Tammye] Careful. Step over things.
-Myles.

09:22.937 --> 09:24.939
[Tan] I'm assuming Myles is single

09:25.022 --> 09:27.441
-if he's living messily.
-[Tammye] Yes.

09:27.525 --> 09:29.527
-Nobody wants this in their partner.
-No.

09:29.610 --> 09:31.612
[Jonathan] Karamo is so upset, he's like--

09:31.696 --> 09:34.407
-I'm like-- Yes.
-Going crazy on the inside.

09:34.490 --> 09:38.119
There's no way as a parent
that I'm walking in to my door

09:38.202 --> 09:41.414
and see a trail of my child's clothes
and I'm cool with it.

09:41.497 --> 09:43.583
[Tammye]
He says this is his creative mess.

09:43.666 --> 09:45.668
[Bobby] That's a BS excuse.

09:46.252 --> 09:48.379
We'll deal with him.
Can we see your room?

09:48.462 --> 09:49.547
Yes, come on.

09:49.630 --> 09:51.674
Careful. Be careful.

09:51.757 --> 09:53.759
-This is me right here.
-[Tan] Nice and tidy.

09:53.843 --> 09:56.012
-On the whole?
-[Tammye] Can I close this door?

09:56.095 --> 09:57.138
-No.
-No, no.

09:57.221 --> 09:58.139
-No?
-Nope.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.516
[Tan] Oh, my God, what happened?

10:00.600 --> 10:03.978
-Mama, what happened?
-[Tammye] That's my creative mess.

10:04.061 --> 10:07.106
[Bobby] I'm starting to see
where Baby Myles gets it.

10:07.273 --> 10:10.484
If I have a messy room,
it gives me so much anxiety.

10:10.568 --> 10:13.654
This is causing more anxiety
than you need. You're already busy.

10:13.738 --> 10:15.072
This is gonna add to it.

10:15.156 --> 10:16.907
What is it you're wearing to church?

10:16.991 --> 10:21.120
I'm the head usher at church, and usually,
I wear something black,

10:21.203 --> 10:22.955
or a combination of black and white.

10:23.039 --> 10:25.458
It's the uniform color of the ushers.

10:25.541 --> 10:29.086
It's just comfortable,
because I'm there for everybody else.

10:29.170 --> 10:30.630
And I'm never off-duty.

10:30.713 --> 10:31.631
[Tan] Okay. Okay.

10:31.714 --> 10:33.633
-But I love that.
-[Tan] Okay.

10:33.716 --> 10:36.344
There's that amazing hat. Can I grab that?

10:36.427 --> 10:38.179
-Oh, yes.
-That's beautiful.

10:38.262 --> 10:39.805
-Okay.
-Oh, that's Patty's.

10:39.889 --> 10:42.516
-So, who's Miss Patty?
-That was my mom.

10:42.600 --> 10:43.809
Oh, it was?

10:43.893 --> 10:46.771
She was known as the Hat Lady.
She wore her hats to church.

10:46.854 --> 10:49.148
[Tan] Do you wear hats also to church?

10:49.231 --> 10:53.319
No, I don't. You know, I never thought
about it until she passed away,

10:53.402 --> 10:56.364
'cause I always thought--
I had the round face.

10:56.447 --> 10:58.491
I didn't think the hats would work.

10:58.574 --> 11:00.618
Can I see it on? Do you mind?

11:01.369 --> 11:04.914
Her mom nursed Mama Tammye
and her sister back to health

11:05.039 --> 11:06.415
when they had breast cancer.

11:07.124 --> 11:10.670
When she walks in that homecoming,
I want her to feel the spirit of her mom.

11:10.753 --> 11:12.880
Oh, you look beautiful in it.

11:13.714 --> 11:16.467
-It's so cute. It looks real good.
-You guys say I look--

11:16.550 --> 11:18.677
I want her to feel the power
that her mom had,

11:18.761 --> 11:20.638
the command that her mom had of a room.

11:21.305 --> 11:24.642
For everything you do for the community,
you deserve self-care.

11:24.725 --> 11:28.187
-You're gonna make me like a diva?
-Oh, my gosh.

11:28.270 --> 11:30.523
-Oh, diva.
-Mama, you don't even know.

11:30.606 --> 11:32.566
You don't even know.

11:32.650 --> 11:34.610
-[Tammye] Are you serious?
-Yeah.

11:34.693 --> 11:37.738
-[Antoni] Do you grow these tomatoes?
-I do. I grew these.

11:37.822 --> 11:39.448
What's the goal?

11:39.990 --> 11:41.659
-It's homecoming.
-Yeah.

11:41.742 --> 11:44.286
Homecoming is a long-standing tradition.

11:44.370 --> 11:45.454
I love that word.

11:45.538 --> 11:47.665
-Oh, home, come on home, baby.
-Uh-huh.

11:48.165 --> 11:53.254
It's that one day in the year
where everybody comes together.

11:53.337 --> 11:55.339
And you'll have food--

11:55.423 --> 11:59.009
-What are you contributing?
-I usually make macaroni salad.

11:59.093 --> 12:01.137
-Talk me through it.
-Macaroni and eggs,

12:01.220 --> 12:04.515
-some pickles, a little taste of mustard,
-Mm-hm.

12:05.099 --> 12:08.269
-mayonnaise, onion--
-Mm-hm. A lot of mayonnaise?

12:10.187 --> 12:12.481
-Guilty.
-Did you have to ask that?

12:12.565 --> 12:14.275
-Did you have to ask?
-Hey.

12:14.358 --> 12:17.653
I know our goal this week
is to help finish this community center.

12:17.736 --> 12:21.699
But sounds like Tammye has the homecoming
figured out in this potluck situation.

12:21.782 --> 12:26.078
For once, I'm not the one teaching.
I'm here to learn, help and be of service.

12:26.162 --> 12:27.705
I wanna hug you again.

12:27.788 --> 12:30.166
-Anytime, anytime.
-You're a treasure.

12:30.249 --> 12:31.917
Look at your bedroom, honey.

12:32.001 --> 12:35.129
-Let's get up here and have a chat.
-Just roll around.

12:35.212 --> 12:36.964
-Can I take my shoes off?
-Okay.

12:37.047 --> 12:38.757
-Can I take mine off?
-Yes, queen.

12:38.841 --> 12:41.093
-Let me take my shoes off.
-Let's cuddle, chat.

12:41.177 --> 12:43.095
-I'm home.
-I'm living for your short hair.

12:43.179 --> 12:46.140
-Did I tell you why I wear short hair?
-No.

12:46.432 --> 12:48.017
My hair used to be really long.

12:48.100 --> 12:53.355
And then, uh, when I was diagnosed
with cancer, of course, it all fell out.

12:53.439 --> 12:55.065
You know, I was just bald.

12:55.149 --> 12:58.110
And I was about to put on, like, scarves,

12:58.194 --> 12:59.528
-and thought about it.
-Yeah.

12:59.612 --> 13:02.656
And then it was like God spoke to me.
He said, "Don't put it on."

13:02.740 --> 13:07.661
He said, "Take it off. I want people
to see openly what I'm doing for you."

13:07.745 --> 13:08.787
-Take it off.
-Oh.

13:08.871 --> 13:13.000
-And I rocked my bald for a year.
-'Cause your face is gorgeous.

13:13.083 --> 13:16.086
You got cheekbones all over the place.
You got these big eyes.

13:16.253 --> 13:18.797
-Your face is gorgeous.
-Let me ask you something.

13:18.881 --> 13:20.090
What about the gray?

13:20.216 --> 13:24.136
Here's the thing. I'm down with you
coloring your hair to cover the sparkle.

13:24.220 --> 13:26.597
-I feel like the top is too light.
-Yeah.

13:26.680 --> 13:29.767
I wanna blend it together
and create a more natural look.

13:29.850 --> 13:32.186
I can make it so shiny, so pretty.
Oh, my gosh.

13:32.269 --> 13:36.273
We're gonna have a Steel Magnolias moment.
It'll be fun. I love it. You deserve it.

13:36.357 --> 13:38.526
-I love you.
-I love you.

13:39.193 --> 13:40.736
[Jonathan] Hi, boys.

13:41.237 --> 13:43.113
-How are you guys?
-How's it going here?

13:43.197 --> 13:44.448
-Good.
-Hello, Tammye.

13:44.532 --> 13:45.824
[Jonathan] Welcome.

13:46.325 --> 13:49.119
-We just got out of bed.
-We did. We did.

13:49.578 --> 13:52.039
-We were having a full-on cuddle.
-Yes.

13:52.122 --> 13:52.998
[Jonathan] We were.

13:53.082 --> 13:56.335
We kicked our shoes off.
Then get up in this bed.

13:56.418 --> 13:58.254
We can leave them on the stairway.

13:58.337 --> 14:00.464
-Hey.
-Oh, speaking of.

14:00.548 --> 14:02.716
-How are you?
-Hi.

14:03.384 --> 14:05.010
[Tan] Hi, how are you?

14:05.135 --> 14:06.762
I'm Tan. Nice to meet you.

14:06.845 --> 14:09.390
I'm liking your shoes
and your jeans combo.

14:09.473 --> 14:10.766
-No joke.
-[Myles] Thank you.

14:10.849 --> 14:12.935
That fit on those ankles is lovely.

14:13.018 --> 14:15.062
Yes. It's women's size, so--

14:15.145 --> 14:16.689
-Yes!
-[Tan] There you go.

14:16.772 --> 14:18.482
Don't be afraid of lady's wear.

14:18.566 --> 14:20.025
-You just moved back home?
-Yes.

14:20.109 --> 14:23.195
-And she's the major perk of being home?
-[Myles] Oh, yeah.

14:23.279 --> 14:26.240
-Yeah?
-Our relationship's gotten much stronger

14:26.323 --> 14:28.492
-Yeah.
-just by us seeing each other every day.

14:28.576 --> 14:29.410
I can't talk.

14:29.702 --> 14:32.121
Oh, my God, I look at my children.

14:32.204 --> 14:35.875
And for them to respect you,
and to admire you...

14:36.584 --> 14:38.043
-is priceless.
-Yeah.

14:38.127 --> 14:39.253
Definitely a tulip.

14:39.670 --> 14:40.796
[all laughing]

14:40.880 --> 14:41.755
[Tan] Yeah, he is.

14:41.839 --> 14:43.549
Can I spend time with this tulip?

14:43.632 --> 14:44.925
-Is that okay?
-That's fine.

14:45.009 --> 14:46.594
[Karamo] Is that cool? Can we spend time?

14:46.677 --> 14:50.431
I can only imagine growing up
in this town, being black and gay.

14:50.514 --> 14:52.600
Yeah. It's so hard.

14:52.683 --> 14:56.770
I can understand the feelings
of being judged, by experience.

14:56.854 --> 14:59.481
I'm so blessed to have a mother
like I have

15:00.190 --> 15:03.152
'cause mostly, these mothers here,
if you're gay, you're gone.

15:03.235 --> 15:06.405
-There's other gay people down here?
-Like, two. [laughing]

15:06.906 --> 15:09.700
It's just walking down the street,
being called the F-word.

15:09.783 --> 15:11.911
Being called the N-word sometimes.

15:12.912 --> 15:16.916
-And being bullied, like, from the start.
-Yeah.

15:16.999 --> 15:20.544
[Myles] Just because I was different.
I talked and acted differently.

15:20.711 --> 15:25.049
-I just started feeling lonely, you know?
-I see a lot of myself in Myles.

15:25.132 --> 15:29.094
I understand what it was like to grow up
in the South with a loving family.

15:29.178 --> 15:33.933
And then to feel some rejection
from your family, community, your church.

15:34.016 --> 15:35.726
Feeling like, "What do I do now?"

15:35.809 --> 15:40.314
-What do you miss the most about church?
-The music. I see choir as therapy.

15:40.773 --> 15:44.485
And with me, I connect to God with music.

15:45.069 --> 15:48.322
I've really enjoyed meeting you
because I truly see love.

15:48.739 --> 15:51.408
-You know, I grew up really religious.
-Mm-hm.

15:53.827 --> 15:55.454
Yeah? Mm-hm.

15:57.581 --> 16:00.709
There wasn't a day I wasn't at church.
It was my life.

16:00.793 --> 16:03.212
-Those people were my family.
-Mm-hm. Yes.

16:04.088 --> 16:06.840
And I knew from a young age
that I was gay.

16:06.924 --> 16:07.758
Mm-hm.

16:07.841 --> 16:11.345
And I'd be down there at that altar
every Sunday, just crying and begging God

16:11.428 --> 16:13.138
to not make me gay.

16:14.348 --> 16:18.185
Once everyone there found out,
completely turned their back on me.

16:18.310 --> 16:21.355
You know? I wouldn't step foot
in your church today.

16:21.563 --> 16:24.316
-The other guys went in. I wouldn't.
-Wow. Why?

16:24.400 --> 16:27.194
I told myself
I'd never go back to a church.

16:27.903 --> 16:31.949
I was so hurt. And I know
that's what Myles is going through.

16:32.032 --> 16:33.200
Mm-hm.

16:33.409 --> 16:36.787
What was it about being in the big city
that made you say, "I gotta go"?

16:36.954 --> 16:37.871
It was just--

16:37.955 --> 16:40.457
Everybody is just go, go, go all the time.

16:40.916 --> 16:43.794
Then I found myself getting lost.
I didn't know who I was.

16:44.294 --> 16:47.006
I lost contact with family
for two years when I was there.

16:47.089 --> 16:48.799
-Really?
-Yeah, I was just--

16:48.882 --> 16:50.592
It was crazy. I was a mess. [laughs]

16:50.676 --> 16:53.095
I thought of it as trying to find myself.

16:53.512 --> 16:57.057
I kind of cut off anything
I had associated with home, away.

16:57.141 --> 17:00.936
Yeah. Has your mother--?
Has your relationship always been close?

17:01.311 --> 17:04.398
No. [laughs] When I first came out,
it was really hard.

17:04.481 --> 17:09.194
She came up on the small-town
Christian belief that you were condemned,

17:09.278 --> 17:12.656
and it was just disgusting,
and it's an abomination.

17:12.740 --> 17:15.367
-Yeah.
-She projected those feelings onto me.

17:15.784 --> 17:18.871
Which is hard, to the point
where I didn't like being around her.

17:18.954 --> 17:20.748
I didn't like being at home.

17:20.831 --> 17:24.001
But she got cancer my senior year
of high school.

17:24.084 --> 17:28.088
That gave her the time to really sit back
and reflect upon her life.

17:28.380 --> 17:31.759
How do you feel about this homecoming
your mother is putting together?

17:31.842 --> 17:32.718
I don't know.

17:32.801 --> 17:34.428
I'm a little iffy about it.

17:34.511 --> 17:38.348
[laughs] It's the fear I don't know
how they will receive me.

17:40.184 --> 17:45.481
I tell people all the time, you know,
this is a catchphrase people just use,

17:45.564 --> 17:49.318
and they let it roll off their tongue,
"What would Jesus do?"

17:49.401 --> 17:50.694
Right.

17:50.778 --> 17:55.783
You know? And I take that,
you know, very, very seriously.

17:55.866 --> 18:00.287
You can't antagonize and evangelize
at the same time, you know.

18:00.370 --> 18:03.749
And that's why the greatest commandment
of these is love.

18:03.832 --> 18:07.544
That's one of the things this homecoming
in the community center represents.

18:07.628 --> 18:09.797
Myles, come home.

18:10.339 --> 18:12.299
That's what we're gonna tell you.

18:13.133 --> 18:14.885
You're God's son.

18:15.636 --> 18:16.470
It's okay.

18:18.931 --> 18:22.518
-Oh! Before I start-- [laughs]
-Let's get out of here

18:22.601 --> 18:25.270
-and see how the other boys are doing.
-Oh, my God.

18:25.729 --> 18:26.688
Wow.

18:27.064 --> 18:28.941
-Hi.
-Hello.

18:29.024 --> 18:31.985
-We're just stooping it out here.
-Hi, sweetie.

18:32.778 --> 18:35.322
[Karamo] You are full of love and light.

18:36.031 --> 18:39.243
Seriously.
I just immediately felt at home.

18:39.326 --> 18:42.246
Yes, you're home. That's right.
Y'all are home.

18:42.329 --> 18:44.456
Normally, we have one person
we're gonna help,

18:44.540 --> 18:47.626
but the fact we're helping you,
which will serve your community,

18:47.709 --> 18:50.212
it's way better
than I could have expected.

18:50.295 --> 18:55.384
I'm expecting an incredible week of love

18:55.467 --> 19:00.722
and growth on everybody

19:00.806 --> 19:03.725
including myself,
and I'm looking forward to it.

19:03.809 --> 19:05.435
[Tan] It's gonna be amazing.

19:05.727 --> 19:07.312
-Yeah.
-It's gonna be so much fun.

19:07.396 --> 19:08.230
-Yeah.
-Yes.

19:08.313 --> 19:10.941
And you upped the population
of gay men in Gay, Georgia,

19:11.024 --> 19:13.026
-by 500 percent.
-I know.

19:13.110 --> 19:16.155
It is up by 500 percent.
You thought you're alone here?

19:16.238 --> 19:17.072
Okay?

19:17.156 --> 19:19.741
-Yes, time to open up a club.
-[all laughing]

19:19.825 --> 19:21.827
♪ I want you to stay ♪

19:24.204 --> 19:25.289
♪ In my life ♪

19:25.372 --> 19:26.540
♪ Lord ♪

19:26.915 --> 19:30.878
This homecoming in this community center
is a culmination of a lifetime of work.

19:30.961 --> 19:33.755
A lifetime of love.
It's also the culmination of a lifetime

19:33.839 --> 19:36.175
of Tammye not knowing
how to take care of herself.

19:36.258 --> 19:39.595
There is a diva in there. All she needs
is a bold lip and some lashes,

19:39.678 --> 19:43.056
and a new haircut,
so she can put her best foot forward.

19:44.266 --> 19:47.269
[Bobby] At first, it was hard for me
to wrap my head around a vision

19:47.352 --> 19:48.687
for the community center,

19:48.770 --> 19:53.483
because if you think about it,
this is literally 50 years in the making.

19:53.567 --> 19:57.946
A 50-year dream that's finally
being fulfilled by a bunch of gays.

19:58.030 --> 20:02.409
I mean, who'd have thought a bunch of gays
would come to Gay, Georgia,

20:02.492 --> 20:05.078
and build a community center for a church.

20:05.746 --> 20:08.290
[Antoni] It's especially rewarding
to help somebody

20:08.373 --> 20:10.709
who puts her own community before herself.

20:11.126 --> 20:13.712
I think we can learn from somebody
who's so grateful.

20:13.795 --> 20:18.675
I've been desperate for us
to finally take on a female as a client.

20:18.759 --> 20:20.844
She wanted to feel like a diva.

20:20.928 --> 20:25.307
I want Sundays, and in particular
this homecoming, for her to really shine.

20:26.558 --> 20:29.519
[Karamo] I'm hoping to encourage Myles
to be comfortable with himself.

20:29.603 --> 20:31.438
When he gets comfortable with himself,

20:31.521 --> 20:34.107
he'll realize that no matter where he is,
he belongs.

-What's going on? Okay.
-Okay. [laughing]

21:10.477 --> 21:13.689
-[Tan] You know how this goes?
-I was making them before they were born.

21:13.772 --> 21:15.274
[Tan] Oh, you were? All right.

21:16.316 --> 21:19.403
We're gonna do a layer of crackers,
and then bananas.

21:19.486 --> 21:22.114
[Antoni] These wafers,
when they soak up the pudding,

21:22.197 --> 21:25.200
and they get all nice and soft, I mean...

21:25.284 --> 21:26.326
[laughs]

21:26.410 --> 21:28.370
We're gonna mix the milk.

21:28.453 --> 21:30.414
I used to say, "How much to put, Mama?"

21:30.497 --> 21:34.084
-She said, "Pour till I tell you to stop."
-Yes!

21:34.167 --> 21:35.502
-Do you all sing?
-I don't.

21:35.585 --> 21:36.545
I don't sing.

21:36.628 --> 21:38.380
-I don't.
-Not at all?

21:38.463 --> 21:41.049
The rest of the family, everybody--

21:41.133 --> 21:43.260
-Why don't you sing?
-We were robbed.

21:43.343 --> 21:45.137
[all laughing]

21:45.220 --> 21:47.389
I'm kind of like the wind
beneath the wings, like:

21:47.472 --> 21:49.099
[singing]

21:51.893 --> 21:53.145
Yes.

21:53.228 --> 21:55.897
As a matter of fact,
Myles was one of the ones

21:55.981 --> 21:58.025
that started the praise team at church.

21:58.108 --> 22:01.236
-He grew up singing in the choir.
-[Tan] Yeah.

22:01.320 --> 22:06.408
He recognized the voices, gathered them
together, and rehearsed with them and all.

22:06.491 --> 22:08.243
Then he went off to college.

22:08.327 --> 22:10.120
[Tan] Did he learn singing from you?

22:10.454 --> 22:13.415
Yeah, he did. When he was small.

22:13.498 --> 22:15.167
I always encouraged him.

22:15.250 --> 22:20.213
Even when he was in college,
he sang in the choir there. Wow.

22:20.297 --> 22:23.550
So, why is Myles hesitant to come back?
Do you know?

22:24.343 --> 22:29.514
He's just struggling that,
will he be accepted?

22:29.598 --> 22:33.769
It's just a matter of overcoming his fear,
because he has shared

22:33.852 --> 22:36.229
with me that he has been bullied.

22:36.313 --> 22:38.356
Hopefully, he can find a way to move on

22:38.440 --> 22:40.859
by seeing acceptance from you guys,
at least.

22:40.942 --> 22:44.029
Other kids who bullied him
may not ever accept him.

22:44.112 --> 22:46.907
May not ever change their hearts.
As long as you are open

22:46.990 --> 22:48.909
-and willing to accept him.
-Yes.

22:50.160 --> 22:52.412
[Tan] How was it when he first told you
he was gay?

22:52.496 --> 22:54.331
He told you when he was 14, right?

22:54.414 --> 22:58.585
Around 14. It took me aback for a minute,
and for a while,

22:58.668 --> 23:00.337
and it was a process.

23:00.420 --> 23:02.881
Brenda, she was the one that was always--

23:02.964 --> 23:06.134
You know, she will talk to me,
you know, about it.

23:06.218 --> 23:09.471
When God enlightened my heart,
we sat around this table.

23:09.554 --> 23:11.723
I sat here, he sat there.

23:12.224 --> 23:15.560
And I said, "Mama needs
to apologize to you."

23:15.811 --> 23:19.731
And he looked at me in my eyes,
and he was like, "For what, Mama?"

23:19.940 --> 23:25.445
I said, "Because Mama loves you.
You know that, right?"

23:25.821 --> 23:27.239
And he said, "Yes."

23:27.322 --> 23:30.325
I said, "But I need to ask you
for your forgiveness,

23:30.909 --> 23:34.412
because Mama has not loved you
unconditionally."

23:35.747 --> 23:39.126
And, you know, he looked at me, he's--

23:39.209 --> 23:41.837
"Mama, I forgave you a long time ago."

23:42.170 --> 23:45.715
And I said,
"No, I need to hear you say that."

23:46.424 --> 23:51.930
I said, because the Bible that I read
tells me that if I have wronged somebody,

23:52.013 --> 23:53.682
I mistreated someone,

23:54.266 --> 23:58.979
to ask their forgiveness first,
and then I'm free to go to the father.

23:59.062 --> 24:02.524
And I told him at that point,
"Your Mama has your back."

24:03.233 --> 24:06.278
[Antoni] She thought her faith told her
to judge somebody who's gay.

24:06.862 --> 24:09.739
But she chose to see past that,
and she saw the individual.

24:09.823 --> 24:13.076
She saw the person that her son is
and changed her mind.

24:13.535 --> 24:16.830
She says that it was a religious
experience, but she made that choice.

24:18.707 --> 24:20.125
Not all parents do that.

24:21.209 --> 24:23.879
One of the things for me, you know,

24:23.962 --> 24:27.424
that I struggled with
when Myles came out to me that he was gay,

24:27.507 --> 24:31.720
I think it felt like almost a broken dream

24:31.803 --> 24:34.431
of him having a child.

24:34.514 --> 24:35.557
I get that.

24:35.640 --> 24:40.103
-Do you mean that for Myles or for you?
-For me, you know.

24:40.187 --> 24:42.314
That dream of him having,

24:42.397 --> 24:46.109
you know, a natural child that's his,
you know what I'm saying?

24:46.193 --> 24:48.987
Myles can still have kids.
I'm working on my kids next year.

24:49.070 --> 24:50.906
-They're gonna be my children.
-Yes.

24:50.989 --> 24:53.325
We're gonna have a surrogate,
but they're my babies.

24:53.408 --> 24:55.994
Just because he's gay doesn't mean
he won't have children.

24:56.077 --> 24:58.496
-Yeah, oh, yeah.
-Yes!

25:06.004 --> 25:09.591
In the beginning, I was apprehensive
about this renovation.

25:09.674 --> 25:13.053
The Church was involved,
and I was worried we'd be judged

25:13.136 --> 25:16.932
and not accepted, but that's not
what I've gotten with Tammye.

25:17.015 --> 25:18.391
-Hey, looking good.
-Hey.

25:18.475 --> 25:20.393
-How you doing? Doing good?
-We're quick.

25:20.477 --> 25:21.770
Oh, yes, fantastic.

25:21.853 --> 25:25.482
I'm excited to be helping Miss Tammye
fulfill her and her mama

25:25.565 --> 25:29.444
and grandmama's dream
of making that community center a reality.

25:29.527 --> 25:33.531
I want to make it a space where kids have
their place, the elderly have their place.

25:33.615 --> 25:37.702
It's the perfect harmony of people
coming together to help each other.

25:40.038 --> 25:41.539
[pop music playing]

25:48.588 --> 25:52.968
We're gonna do a surprise.
Your mama doesn't know you're coming.

25:53.051 --> 25:56.388
Oh, my gosh. So, today
is Tammye's daughter's birthday.

25:56.471 --> 25:59.140
We need to have
a Steel Magnolias moment.

26:00.141 --> 26:02.269
-Look who we have.
-Hi.

26:02.894 --> 26:04.229
[Jonathan] Get over here.

26:04.562 --> 26:05.981
-Hi.
-[Jonathan] How are you?

26:06.064 --> 26:08.400
You look gorgeous in this yellow dress.

26:08.483 --> 26:10.026
-Thank you.
-I'm Jonathan.

26:10.110 --> 26:11.528
-I'm Brenda.
-Nice to meet you.

26:11.611 --> 26:14.823
Tammye's totally stuck
in a color rut with her hair.

26:14.906 --> 26:18.201
She doesn't know how to come out
and be the diva she was born to be.

26:18.285 --> 26:21.079
I'm like, "Just because you only
spend five minutes on glam

26:21.162 --> 26:22.872
does not mean you cannot be a diva."

26:22.956 --> 26:26.793
I want to tone this color down
closer to your natural color.

26:26.876 --> 26:29.296
Then I'm gonna take some of this color

26:29.379 --> 26:32.882
on the top that has some of the lightness,
and isolate that.

26:32.966 --> 26:36.011
It'll be more like a natural vibe,
like you went to Costa Rica,

26:36.094 --> 26:39.347
and you were surfing, you were celebrating
your cancer-free life,

26:39.431 --> 26:42.100
and you got a bit of a tan,
so you got a bit of tips.

26:42.183 --> 26:43.768
-There you go, honey.
-Yes.

26:43.852 --> 26:46.730
Doing block treatment for Jessica.
Tightening up her roots.

26:46.813 --> 26:50.066
And I have got my hands full
transforming Tammye.

26:50.150 --> 26:52.152
We're gonna have so much fun.

26:52.235 --> 26:55.071
♪ The way she moves
The way she shakes ♪

26:56.114 --> 27:00.452
Listen, when your mother's not around
she talks about you in a way that--

27:00.535 --> 27:03.663
Like, "Who's this Prince Charming
about to walk through this door?"

27:03.747 --> 27:05.790
-"Who's this?" You know?
-Yeah.

27:05.874 --> 27:10.253
Once you believe that more, other things
in your life will start changing.

27:10.337 --> 27:12.589
Like, picking up after yourself.

27:12.672 --> 27:13.715
[laughing]

27:13.798 --> 27:15.383
That's a big one.

27:16.509 --> 27:20.889
Part of, like, when you're not feeling
the best is also reflected in other areas.

27:20.972 --> 27:22.891
[Jonathan] Are you so excited
for the homecoming?

27:22.974 --> 27:24.225
I am, I am.

27:24.309 --> 27:26.603
How many people do you think
will come for that?

27:26.686 --> 27:28.521
At least 200, if not more.

27:28.605 --> 27:29.773
-Crap.
-Yes.

27:32.400 --> 27:35.278
Yes, Halle. I didn't know
I was gonna meet Halle Berry today.

27:35.362 --> 27:38.823
-Get away from here, boy. Get away.
-With this haircut. Get out of here.

27:38.907 --> 27:41.826
No. I won't. [laughing]

27:42.452 --> 27:44.829
Your mother invited you
to this homecoming.

27:44.913 --> 27:47.707
-Yeah.
-I understand your apprehension.

27:47.791 --> 27:50.001
I've had a different experience
with the Church.

27:50.085 --> 27:52.921
For me, anytime someone came
with their ignorance

27:53.004 --> 27:56.466
and tried to say like,
"You're going to hell," or whatever,

27:56.549 --> 27:59.177
I always was like,
"My granny taught me God is love.

27:59.260 --> 28:01.596
So, I'm not even listening
to what you're saying."

28:01.679 --> 28:03.973
I did feel the love
and everything, it was like--

28:04.057 --> 28:09.604
I just need to get over the fact
that it went down. [laughs] You know?

28:09.687 --> 28:11.648
-Is that a point of contention?
-Yeah.

28:11.731 --> 28:15.151
There's still that point where
you're thinking like, they don't love you.

28:15.235 --> 28:16.903
You know, even if they do.

28:16.986 --> 28:20.865
There's still that little voice
that's like, they're not for it.

28:20.949 --> 28:25.578
Truth be told, like, this homecoming
celebration is bigger than church.

28:25.662 --> 28:28.540
Because whether or not
you go back to church

28:28.623 --> 28:32.794
and start participating in organized
religion again is not the real thing here.

28:32.877 --> 28:34.504
-Exactly.
-Like, homecoming

28:34.587 --> 28:38.258
is for us to come around people
we love and be reenergized.

28:38.341 --> 28:40.510
-A big family reunion.
-A big family reunion.

28:40.593 --> 28:43.096
So, I just need to know, are you gonna go?

28:47.100 --> 28:48.435
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Okay.

28:48.518 --> 28:49.728
Anything for her. [laughs]

-Oh, my God. Mama.
-How are you?

29:02.615 --> 29:03.783
[Tammye] Give me some sugar.

29:04.909 --> 29:07.579
-You getting that pampering treatment?
-Yes.

29:07.662 --> 29:11.207
I brought him so he can get pampered, too.
He needs to get his hair cut.

29:11.291 --> 29:12.667
Come on. Come on.

29:13.084 --> 29:16.212
I love that Tammye is getting pampered,
but I wanna pamper Myles.

29:16.546 --> 29:19.674
We need to shape all of that up,
so you're just fresh.

29:19.758 --> 29:23.636
It's true. When you work on the outside,
sometimes it makes you feel better inside.

29:23.720 --> 29:25.138
A hug, baby girl.

29:26.848 --> 29:27.891
Hi.

29:30.185 --> 29:32.228
[Karamo] Look at that. You look great.

29:33.021 --> 29:35.315
-Oh, wow.
-[Karamo] Peter Gunz. Killed it.

29:36.816 --> 29:38.735
-That's nice.
-You look good.

29:39.402 --> 29:41.946
-Why are you shaking? Nervous? Why?
-A little bit.

29:42.030 --> 29:43.490
I don't know, it's a big thing.

29:43.573 --> 29:45.408
-Homecoming is me coming back.
-Yeah.

29:45.492 --> 29:48.661
It doesn't matter how they're gonna
take you, they're gonna see you.

29:48.745 --> 29:52.081
You're going there
to enjoy yourself with your family.

29:52.165 --> 29:54.125
Coming home, reconnect with them.

29:54.751 --> 29:58.213
[Jonathan] You highlight that cheekbone,
like, she's running away from you.

29:58.296 --> 30:00.131
-[Karamo] Stay next to me.
-Don't you wink at me

30:00.215 --> 30:02.967
-trying to make me feel certain things.
-Look at him.

30:03.051 --> 30:06.513
-Oh, Myles.
-I have something to tell you.

30:06.805 --> 30:11.518
Um, first of all, the clothes in my room,
I'm gonna fix that.

30:11.601 --> 30:15.104
It's not really me being lazy,
it's just what's going on internally

30:15.188 --> 30:16.898
until I'm down, that's what happens.

30:16.981 --> 30:20.985
So, I'm gonna work on motivating myself
to do better, you know?

30:21.069 --> 30:22.487
-Like--
-Oh, Myles.

30:22.570 --> 30:24.239
[Myles] And second of all...

30:25.031 --> 30:29.828
I've decided after a lot of thought
and consideration... to go to homecoming.

30:30.370 --> 30:31.663

Thank you, Jesus!

30:38.711 --> 30:39.587
Yes.

30:43.049 --> 30:45.927
-Yeah. I'm excited.
-Welcome home, Myles.

30:46.010 --> 30:49.347
I used to-- At him about going to church
or whatever.

30:49.430 --> 30:54.185
And my mom would always say,
"Leave him alone. He's gonna be okay."

30:54.269 --> 30:55.687
You know? And I just...

30:58.857 --> 31:03.862
[sobbing] I just wish she was here to see
that he's okay, you know?

31:04.487 --> 31:05.488
We're all okay.

31:06.072 --> 31:09.909
-I just-- I'm sorry, y'all. I just--
-[Karamo] No, do not apologize.

31:09.993 --> 31:13.621
-Give your mama a hug.
-Oh, my God, Myles.

31:14.247 --> 31:16.457
We have another surprise,
Bobby and I, for you.

31:16.541 --> 31:19.377
-So, we're gonna leave you back to this.
-Bye.

31:20.295 --> 31:21.462
Bye. Thank you.

31:21.546 --> 31:25.383
-Bye, everybody.
-So, I know that was a good moment.

31:25.466 --> 31:27.135
I love that you and Myles had that,

31:27.218 --> 31:29.721
but are you ready to fall in love
with your new hair?

31:29.804 --> 31:34.017
All right. We're happening. Ready?
Three, two, one, and here we are.

31:34.559 --> 31:35.476
Wow.

31:35.643 --> 31:37.312
Let me take this off of you.

31:37.395 --> 31:38.771
-Oh, my Lord.
-So you can see.

31:39.439 --> 31:42.108
Look at this hair.
She's like, "Get all up in that hair.

31:42.191 --> 31:43.651
Give yourself a gander."

31:44.110 --> 31:45.069
Wow.

31:45.695 --> 31:47.530
-Doesn't she look amazing?
-Oh, my Lord.

31:47.614 --> 31:49.324
-[Jonathan] The lightness to your ends.
-Yes.

31:49.407 --> 31:53.119
-Yes. Yes.
-But see how shiny and gorge?

31:54.037 --> 31:55.872
Oh, my goodness.

31:55.955 --> 31:57.248
Give me a hug.

31:57.332 --> 32:00.418
-I love you so much.
-I love you, love you, love you.

32:01.336 --> 32:03.004
[choir singing]

32:11.054 --> 32:12.555
-[Karamo] Do you hear them?
-Yes.

32:12.639 --> 32:16.267
Are you excited? You thought we were
joking we're bring the choir.

32:16.351 --> 32:18.227
[Myles] I didn't think you were joking.

32:18.645 --> 32:19.562
-You're home.
-Gosh.

32:20.063 --> 32:22.690
[Karamo] When you're struggling to fit in,
find the places

32:22.774 --> 32:25.526
where you feel like you belong.
They're not gonna find you.

32:25.610 --> 32:26.694
Are you nervous?

32:26.778 --> 32:28.780
No. I'm just excited.

32:41.960 --> 32:43.378
-Beautiful.
-Thank you.

32:43.461 --> 32:44.921
[all cheering]

32:45.004 --> 32:48.549
-Hey, Robert. How are you doing?
-[Robert] I'm great. How about you?

32:48.633 --> 32:50.301
-This is Myles.
-So nice to meet you.

32:50.385 --> 32:52.345
-[Bobby] That was beautiful.
-It was.

32:52.428 --> 32:54.639
It took me back to my choir days.

32:54.722 --> 32:56.474
Same here. [laughing]

32:56.557 --> 32:58.393
[Robert] Are you gonna audition for us?

32:58.476 --> 33:00.645
-[Karamo] You want us to audition? Sure.
-Yeah.

33:01.312 --> 33:03.314
So just-- Put him in the back.

33:04.691 --> 33:07.777
That's what they said about J.Lo,
and you see where she is.

33:07.860 --> 33:11.531
In my mind, I sound like
Luther Vandross when I'm singing.

33:11.614 --> 33:13.533
[sings, then clearing throat]

33:13.616 --> 33:15.868
[Robert] We're gonna sing
"The Battle of Jericho."

33:15.952 --> 33:17.078
Oh, so exciting.

33:17.161 --> 33:20.039
-Where do we sit?
-You're behind those curtains.

33:20.123 --> 33:21.582
[all laughing]

33:21.708 --> 33:26.421
John Legend, Michael Jackson.
I mean, like, that's how my range is.

33:26.504 --> 33:28.756
I like the back row. Y'all cute.

33:28.840 --> 33:31.592
-That's the troublemakers, so...
-I'm in the perfect spot.

33:31.676 --> 33:32.969
Perfect spot, then.

33:34.554 --> 33:36.222
Okay, pitches, please.

33:36.305 --> 33:38.266
-[Karamo] Can we stand?
-You can stand.

33:38.349 --> 33:40.143

-[Timothy] He's got the notes.

34:21.642 --> 34:23.311
[Robert] He's got the notes. [laughs]

34:23.394 --> 34:24.687
That-- Hmm.

34:25.229 --> 34:27.899
Just like Myles, I quit singing years ago.

34:27.982 --> 34:30.610
But I was able to fill that void
with design--

34:30.693 --> 34:32.570
Myles, would you like to sing the solo,

34:32.653 --> 34:35.198
the beginning of "A Prayer"
for your audition?

34:35.281 --> 34:36.115
Definitely.

34:36.199 --> 34:38.201
--which helped me to move forward

34:38.284 --> 34:40.453
and not get into the funks
that you can get in

34:40.536 --> 34:42.997
when you aren't fulfilling the passions
in your life,

34:43.081 --> 34:45.041

Yeah.

35:06.395 --> 35:07.730
[all cheering]

35:10.983 --> 35:13.611
[Robert] So, we were going to make you
an honorary member,

35:13.694 --> 35:17.365
but I think it's so great that he ought
to just become a member. All right.

35:17.990 --> 35:22.745
-You're like, "Oh, he can sing."
-He can sing. So, you got a T-shirt.

35:22.829 --> 35:24.664
-Thank you so much.
-All right.

35:24.747 --> 35:27.834
-Okay. Welcome.
-Definitely. Thank you. Thank you.

35:29.335 --> 35:32.547
[Myles] I was raised on this for, like,
ten years, and I quit.

35:32.630 --> 35:35.341
It's like a piece of me is gone
because I stopped.

35:35.424 --> 35:38.678
This was my passion.
Like, this is what I was known for.

35:38.761 --> 35:41.472
There's people
with that story in this room.

35:41.556 --> 35:43.599
They'd love to share that story.

35:43.683 --> 35:47.061
-Thank you. We appreciate this.
-Thank you. Thank you for being here.

35:47.145 --> 35:49.897

now that your room is clean?

36:08.249 --> 36:11.210
Refreshed. It feels good.
Not heavy, like it did.

36:11.294 --> 36:15.381
Since you said you're coming tonight,
I actually got you an outfit.

36:15.464 --> 36:18.634
-So, you're excited?
-Yeah. [laughing]

36:23.598 --> 36:26.517
Hello-- Oh, look how gorge you look.

36:26.601 --> 36:27.435
Thank you.

36:27.518 --> 36:29.645
That jacket is all kinds of right.

36:29.729 --> 36:30.813
We're home.

36:30.897 --> 36:33.274
-Excited to see your place?
-Yes, I can't wait.

36:33.858 --> 36:35.818
-[Bobby] Oh, they're here.
-Oh, let's go.

36:35.902 --> 36:37.945
-Hey!
-Hey!

36:38.029 --> 36:41.324
-Are you y'all ready for Foxy Mama?
-[Fab 5] Yeah!

36:41.407 --> 36:42.867
Look at you.

36:42.950 --> 36:45.286
-You look gorgeous.
-Hey, fabulicious.

36:45.369 --> 36:47.163
You look so good.

36:47.246 --> 36:49.290
-Come on. Here we go.
-Come on in.

36:49.373 --> 36:50.208
Welcome home.

36:50.291 --> 36:51.375
-Go, go, go.
-After you.

36:51.459 --> 36:53.502
[Antoni]
I am stealing you first into the kitchen.

36:53.586 --> 36:56.088
Let's get some cooking for the homecoming.

36:56.172 --> 36:57.006
Yes.

36:57.089 --> 37:00.092
Usually, I'm the one teaching,
but I'm gonna give you the reins.

37:00.176 --> 37:02.470
-Teach me how to make your pasta salad.
-Oh, yes.

37:02.553 --> 37:06.557
I always put a dab of salt in here, so
that I don't have to add salt at the end.

37:06.641 --> 37:10.978
You want to concentrate on your eggs now.
Those just cook pretty quick.

37:11.062 --> 37:13.898
How many people are you expecting today?

37:13.981 --> 37:16.859
-At least 200.
-How are you gonna feed all these people?

37:16.943 --> 37:20.655
You'll see. Their hearts are full,
and their stomach is full.

37:20.738 --> 37:23.699
-Where there's a will, there's a way.
-I'm gonna work on the eggs.

37:23.783 --> 37:25.076
I'd love to know real quick,

37:25.159 --> 37:27.745
how many of the condiments
you're gonna be putting in?

37:27.828 --> 37:31.332
Mayo-- It's according
to how the macaroni soaks up.

37:31.415 --> 37:34.961
-We are not skimping on the mayonnaise.
-There you go. Exactly.

37:35.044 --> 37:36.504
[Antoni] And now how much relish?

37:36.587 --> 37:39.882
So maybe about half this jar. You wanna
put just a squeeze of mustard,

37:39.966 --> 37:43.344
because I like to put just enough
to give it a little color.

37:43.427 --> 37:46.138
-Beautiful.
-Wow, that's looking good, honey.

37:46.222 --> 37:48.182
-Why don't you try it?
-Are you feeding me?

37:48.266 --> 37:50.268
Yeah, I'm feeding you. One second.

37:51.227 --> 37:53.604
-What do you think?
-That's delicious.

37:53.688 --> 37:56.315
Bobby, come here. Give them a bite.

37:56.399 --> 38:00.486
Oh, it's so creamy, it's so creamy.
Just, like, a nice little texture.

38:00.778 --> 38:01.612
[Tammye] Yeah.

38:01.696 --> 38:05.116
-I could eat this whole thing.
-You know what, get ready.

38:05.199 --> 38:08.035
I know how to make more of this,
so I'm gonna keep making it.

38:08.119 --> 38:11.831
-Two hundred people.
-What? Oh, you got a lot of work to do.

38:11.914 --> 38:14.041
-I know.
-At least. At least.

38:14.500 --> 38:18.129
-You boys ready?
-Yeah. Come on in, Mama.

38:18.713 --> 38:21.507
Oh, my God.

38:22.466 --> 38:25.928
Is this the same place?
Is this the same boy?

38:26.012 --> 38:28.848
Oh, my God.

38:28.931 --> 38:30.474
Who transformed this room?

38:31.058 --> 38:32.101
I did. [laughs]

38:32.685 --> 38:34.478
[Karamo] Without any of us asking.

38:34.562 --> 38:37.565
Oh, Myles, oh!

38:37.982 --> 38:40.401
This is the young man I knew he could be.

38:40.484 --> 38:41.319
-Yes.
-Yeah.

38:41.402 --> 38:43.446
-Look at the shoes.
-[all laughing]

38:43.529 --> 38:47.199
-Just look at-- Oh, my God. Yes!
-Yes.

38:47.742 --> 38:50.828
Now you've seen how spiffy he looks,
we're gonna take you downstairs.

38:50.911 --> 38:52.455
We're gonna get you ready now.

38:52.538 --> 38:55.499
-Your turn, Mama.
-Get ready for your homecoming.

38:56.083 --> 38:57.043
Hi.

39:00.504 --> 39:03.049
[Bobby] I know you didn't want us
to do anything for you,

39:03.132 --> 39:05.426
but you deserve you time.

39:05.509 --> 39:09.847
And now you can come in here, take a
bubble bath, and take care of Tammye.

39:09.930 --> 39:11.140
[shouting]

39:13.517 --> 39:16.103
[Tammye] This is a dream. Wake me up.

39:16.645 --> 39:19.607
Mm, mm, mm! Mm, mm!

39:19.857 --> 39:21.734
My own space.

39:22.360 --> 39:24.987
What--? How did you do that?

39:25.571 --> 39:27.156
Miracles happen.

39:27.239 --> 39:29.784
[Tan] Will you come in with me?
I need her hair and makeup.

39:29.867 --> 39:32.495
You want a "diva" diva,
that's what he's gonna give you.

39:32.578 --> 39:34.997
-Yeah?
-[Tammye] Thank you. Thank you, sweetie.

39:35.081 --> 39:38.167
Tammye is a giver, but one thing
Tammye needs more than anything

39:38.250 --> 39:41.045
is one safe place
where she can give to herself.

39:41.128 --> 39:43.130
I'm just gonna polish that up.

39:43.214 --> 39:44.423
She deserves to fly.

39:45.174 --> 39:46.967
-[Tan] Okay, ladies, you ready?
-Yes.

39:48.177 --> 39:49.053
How do I look?

39:49.970 --> 39:51.013
Just kidding.

39:53.766 --> 39:55.434
-Yes.
-Classic.

39:55.518 --> 39:57.353
-Yeah.
-Oh, I love...

39:57.436 --> 39:59.230
-Yes.
-the texture up top.

39:59.605 --> 40:01.023
The little peek-a-boo.

40:01.565 --> 40:03.984
The women, they're gonna be so jealous.

40:04.068 --> 40:05.277
Yeah!

40:05.361 --> 40:07.071
-As they should be.
-Gorgeous.

40:07.154 --> 40:10.574
And the men, they gonna look like,
are we in church?

40:10.658 --> 40:13.536
Yes! Let's it take it there.

40:13.619 --> 40:16.122
-We should head over there.
-Time to go? Let's go!

40:16.205 --> 40:17.706
Okay. It's time to go.

40:17.790 --> 40:21.961
-Okay, get this stuff in the car.
-You guys can each grab one of those.

40:23.796 --> 40:26.841
I am so excited for homecoming.

40:27.758 --> 40:31.804
I knew how important your mother
and your grandmother were to you,

40:31.887 --> 40:34.890
and how this whole homecoming
was started from their legacy.

40:34.974 --> 40:37.435
-Yes.
-So, I wanted to get you a Bible

40:37.518 --> 40:41.397
that was inscribed with a Bible verse
and with their names.

40:44.400 --> 40:47.945
This is so powerful,
because my grandmother,

40:48.320 --> 40:50.156
she couldn't even read herself.

40:51.031 --> 40:53.284
But she's,
"I want y'all to know the Bible."

40:53.701 --> 40:57.413
Thinking back,
all the sacrifices that she made.

40:57.496 --> 40:59.623
-And then I look at my mom.
-Yeah.

40:59.707 --> 41:00.916
They always tell me,

41:01.000 --> 41:05.254
"Stay rooted and grounded
in the word of the Lord."

41:05.337 --> 41:06.547
[chuckles]

41:07.339 --> 41:10.384
So many people are gonna be
affected by this.

41:10.468 --> 41:12.595
So many. Oh, my gosh.

41:13.137 --> 41:14.096
You ready, Mama?

41:14.180 --> 41:17.224
-I'm taking my Bible to church.
-Yes, you are.

41:17.308 --> 41:19.977
-Let the church say amen.
-Amen.

41:20.060 --> 41:21.729
-Let's get out of here.
-Yes.

41:21.812 --> 41:25.191
-You ready to see the community center?
-Am I ready?

41:25.274 --> 41:28.569
-I've been waiting my whole life. Yes.
-Yeah.

41:39.663 --> 41:41.123
-Come on.
-Yeah.

41:42.625 --> 41:43.959
-[Bobby] You ready?
-[Tammye] Yes.

41:46.086 --> 41:47.379
[all] Yeah!

41:49.882 --> 41:51.258
Oh, jeez.

41:51.342 --> 41:53.427
-[Bobby] Are you ready?
-[Tammye] We're ready.

41:53.511 --> 41:54.887
[Bobby] All right, Miss Tammye.

41:56.305 --> 41:58.182
Oh, my...

41:58.766 --> 42:01.435
Oh, my...

42:02.228 --> 42:06.774
Oh, my God!

42:06.857 --> 42:10.194
♪ You lift me up and I am heaven ♪

42:11.737 --> 42:13.239
[Tammye] Look at this.

42:15.157 --> 42:19.537
This is beyond anything
that we could ever imagine.

42:19.620 --> 42:21.455
This is beautiful.

42:21.539 --> 42:23.415
[groaning, then chuckles]

42:26.502 --> 42:31.674
This has just been
through the efforts of so many people

42:31.757 --> 42:34.635
over the last 50-something years.

42:35.261 --> 42:39.765
Some are still here,
and some of them are gone.

42:39.848 --> 42:42.017
But this is their legacy.

42:43.519 --> 42:45.813
[Bobby] What do you think
your mama's thinking right now?

42:46.188 --> 42:49.984
-I feel like she is right here.
-Right here.

42:50.067 --> 42:51.193
Oh, my, yes.

42:52.653 --> 42:55.155
-[woman] She'll be so proud.
-Mm-hm.

42:56.907 --> 42:59.326
-Wow. Yes.
-Ready for some more? Okay.

42:59.410 --> 43:01.161
-Take a walk, look around.
-Thank you.

43:01.245 --> 43:02.496
[laughing]

43:02.580 --> 43:04.873
Everyone in the Town of Gay
could sit here.

43:04.957 --> 43:05.916
Yes.

43:06.834 --> 43:09.378
-And look over here.
-Little kids' area.

43:09.461 --> 43:12.089
-Yes!
-[Bobby] Little worktables to play.

43:12.172 --> 43:15.175
Areas for people to lounge,
and just fellowship.

43:15.259 --> 43:16.343
[Tammye] Yes.

43:17.094 --> 43:18.637
Couldn't have done it
without him.

43:18.721 --> 43:21.807
-Come here. Thank you, friend.
-I'm happy for you.

43:21.890 --> 43:25.477
Thank you. Oh, my God.
This place is incredible.

43:25.561 --> 43:29.607
And I think everyone involved
has grown and been touched this week.

43:29.690 --> 43:31.400
-I know I have.
-Us, too.

43:31.483 --> 43:33.944
[Tammye]
This has been a life-changing week for me.

43:34.028 --> 43:38.365
And, you know,
it's just God's amazing grace

43:38.449 --> 43:41.535
that we stand here
in this beautiful facility today.

43:41.702 --> 43:45.414
Before he gave the vision,
he already made provisions,

43:45.497 --> 43:48.250
'cause he knew you guys
would wind up together.

43:48.334 --> 43:52.296
Even before you were formed
in your mothers' wombs, he knew you.

43:52.379 --> 43:53.797
I just-- I'm thankful.

43:54.173 --> 43:58.093
Oh... Come here, Antoni. Antoni.

43:58.177 --> 43:59.553
[all laughing]

44:01.263 --> 44:02.973
Oh, my baby.

44:03.432 --> 44:05.684
You continue to let God use you, baby.

44:06.352 --> 44:09.897
Food is a way to the heart,
and more importantly, the soul.

44:10.272 --> 44:13.108
You keep feeding the souls
of people, okay?

44:13.484 --> 44:16.320
And you, Mister Glam.

44:17.112 --> 44:19.948
That's my new name.
You're calling me that from now on.

44:20.324 --> 44:24.953
Beauty. That's your calling in life.
Everything is made beautiful in its time.

44:25.496 --> 44:27.665
And you add beauty to the world.

44:27.748 --> 44:29.708
-It's your gift, okay?
-Thank you.

44:29.792 --> 44:33.170
You represent a lot of little boys
who look like you.

44:33.962 --> 44:38.384
And they wanna be like you, okay?
Continue making this world a better place.

44:40.010 --> 44:42.846
[Antoni] It's just, like,
one after the other. I can't.

44:44.014 --> 44:47.851
Where's my other babies back here?
Bobby, what have you learned this week?

44:48.268 --> 44:50.854
To remember where I came from.

44:50.938 --> 44:51.772
Yes.

44:51.855 --> 44:54.942
You know, and to let go
of some of the resentment.

44:55.025 --> 44:58.070
-Yes.
-And realize that not everyone out there

44:58.153 --> 45:00.447
that claims to be Christian is good.

45:00.531 --> 45:05.327
-But there are a lot out there that are.
-Yes, baby, more out there who are good.

45:06.453 --> 45:07.538
Come here, baby.

45:07.788 --> 45:09.164
[all laughing]

45:09.915 --> 45:12.459
This is the one I have to spank,
right here.

45:12.835 --> 45:14.962
-Get him.
-That's right.

45:15.045 --> 45:15.921
[all laughing]

45:16.964 --> 45:19.133
Your spirit is so, so pure.

45:19.508 --> 45:22.511
And all you guys, the gifts that you have,

45:22.594 --> 45:27.516
you're using it for the good of humanity,
and that's why you're here on this Earth.

45:27.891 --> 45:32.020
I feel like I have turned into a mirror,
because you're talking about yourself.

45:32.604 --> 45:35.315
You help everyone.
You make the world a better place.

45:35.399 --> 45:38.026
You're empowering your spirit
to everyone you touch.

45:38.569 --> 45:41.989
Tell your mother what you told me
when I asked why you were so quiet.

45:42.239 --> 45:45.242
I'm still nervous about going in.

45:46.827 --> 45:48.954
[Karamo] You have acknowledged
what you were feeling,

45:49.037 --> 45:52.040
and you have started making
dramatic changes for yourself.

45:52.124 --> 45:55.836
Now that you've showed up here,
God is doing the rest right now.

45:55.919 --> 45:59.798
This church and community,
they've opened their doors to us.

46:00.048 --> 46:03.635
Why wouldn't they to you, to someone
they've known and loved your whole life?

46:03.719 --> 46:05.137
Yes. Mm-hm.

46:05.721 --> 46:07.973
Mama's gonna be right there with you.

46:09.600 --> 46:11.101
Praise the Lord.

46:11.602 --> 46:14.229
-You're my children. I'll miss y'all.
-[Jonathan] Group hug.

46:14.313 --> 46:15.397
I'll miss y'all.

46:16.231 --> 46:17.649
I'm gonna miss y'all.

46:18.901 --> 46:20.027
Y'all make Mama proud.

46:20.110 --> 46:22.029
-I love all of y'all.
-We love you, too.

but this is what I've always seen.
The church is where we support each other

47:27.844 --> 47:32.849
We thank God for the occasion we're
here on today, homecoming service.

47:33.100 --> 47:34.184
Yeah.

47:35.269 --> 47:37.813
-[man] Let us eat and be merry.
-[woman] Amen.

47:37.896 --> 47:39.064
[man] We just thank the Lord.

47:39.481 --> 47:41.817
If they ended up in Meriwether County

47:41.900 --> 47:44.278
with all these rural roads
and woods we have,

47:44.361 --> 47:46.613
they got to know God sent them down here.

47:46.697 --> 47:48.198
-[all] Yeah!
-Come on up.

47:48.907 --> 47:50.784
-Amen.
-Amen.

47:51.535 --> 47:53.078
[Tammye] I thank God for this week.

47:53.662 --> 47:56.748
This week, we worked with the Fab 5.

47:56.832 --> 48:00.043
They put their whole heart
into the community center.

48:00.961 --> 48:05.007
These are five gifted men who are gay.

48:05.757 --> 48:07.634
And through the course of the week,

48:07.718 --> 48:10.887
you know, we were able to build
some relationships.

48:10.971 --> 48:14.182
That's what it's about,
building relationships.

48:15.559 --> 48:21.690
They shared with me how they have been
just torn down and rejected.

48:23.025 --> 48:26.194
And the Church has turned their backs
on them.

48:26.987 --> 48:29.406
How can I say that I love God,

48:30.198 --> 48:34.536
but I cannot love the ones
who are right there next to me?

48:35.954 --> 48:37.873
I would call myself a hypocrite.

48:38.832 --> 48:43.962
And I say I was around five gay men,
I was around six.

48:45.922 --> 48:48.091
My son walked away from the Church,

48:48.175 --> 48:52.804
you know, and it's been my prayer
that he comes here and feel the love.

48:53.388 --> 48:57.559
You know, the love that Pastor Favors
founded this place on.

48:58.310 --> 49:01.396
The love that surrounds me every Sunday.

49:01.480 --> 49:04.358
Do I love Jesus? Yes.

49:04.441 --> 49:06.985
Am I a believer? Yes.

49:07.819 --> 49:10.656
Do I love my son? Yes.

49:11.865 --> 49:14.951
Yes, yes, yes.

49:15.494 --> 49:19.289
Mama Tammye is the epitome
of what Southern hospitality is about.

49:20.248 --> 49:22.626
-See.
-Come in, see what you got here.

49:22.709 --> 49:25.712
Mama has taught me so much
about unconditional love.

49:25.796 --> 49:27.339
Look at that, right there.

49:28.256 --> 49:32.594
[laughing] This is Myles,
my son I was talking about, right here.

49:32.678 --> 49:34.805
[Tan] She loves her son implicitly.

49:34.888 --> 49:38.934
Every parent who has a child
should love them no matter what.

49:39.017 --> 49:41.478
See right there?
See the picture of Pastor Favors?

49:42.145 --> 49:44.981
[Jonathan] At the end of the day,
if you're gay, straight, black, white,

49:45.065 --> 49:46.566
it doesn't matter who you are.

49:46.650 --> 49:48.735
We truly are all people
wanting to connect.

49:48.819 --> 49:49.820
Hey, girl.

49:50.237 --> 49:52.489
Before you go judge somebody,
get to know them.

49:52.572 --> 49:55.701
I guarantee you'll find you have
more similarities than differences.

49:55.784 --> 49:59.413
And that's what we all need to do
to everyone.

49:59.496 --> 50:00.956
Not just the LGBT community,

50:01.039 --> 50:03.375
but Christians, Muslims,
Hindus, Buddhists.

50:03.458 --> 50:07.921
Just love and accept them,
because that is what Jesus would do.

50:09.047 --> 50:11.091
[woman] Yes, it will, girl.
Get it, girl!
