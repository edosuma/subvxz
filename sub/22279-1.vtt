WEBVTT

00:06.333 --> 00:08.533
NARRATOR: As winter
fades across the Arctic,

00:08.567 --> 00:11.167
Mother Nature
comes in for the kill.

00:11.200 --> 00:16.500
With predators waking
and unpredictable weather,
the battle begins.

00:16.533 --> 00:19.133
ANDY: Every day counts
out here in the summertime.

00:19.167 --> 00:21.367
NARRATOR: On this episode of
Life Below Zero.

00:21.400 --> 00:22.967
-CHIP: Aim at their heads.
-(GUNSHOT)

00:23.000 --> 00:25.033
NARRATOR: It's a struggle
against rising waters

00:25.067 --> 00:27.367
as the thaw
threatens Sue's livelihood.

00:27.400 --> 00:28.933
SUE: I can't have
a white landscape

00:28.967 --> 00:32.433
turning to green without
some more water coming in.

00:32.467 --> 00:34.767
NARRATOR: Glenn is forced
to carve out a new path.

00:34.800 --> 00:36.267
GLENN: Look out!
It's going. It's going!

00:36.300 --> 00:38.700
NARRATOR: Andy and Kate create
a shelter from the storm.

00:38.733 --> 00:40.100
ANDY: Do or die, babe.

00:40.133 --> 00:42.200
NARRATOR: And the Hailstones
brave new ground

00:42.233 --> 00:44.133
-for a summer harvest.
-(GUNSHOT)

01:09.900 --> 01:11.067
CHIP: Caribou!
AGNES: There!

01:11.100 --> 01:12.933
-Lots of caribou.
-Caribou, caribou.

01:12.967 --> 01:14.867
-Ooh, ooh, ooh. Stay still!
-Stay still.

01:14.900 --> 01:17.533
CHIP: Gunners up front.
You got to stay still.

01:17.567 --> 01:19.467
AGNES: Stay still.

01:19.500 --> 01:22.067
CHIP: We have a bunch
of caribou in front of us.

01:22.100 --> 01:24.067
This is why
we like this place.

01:24.100 --> 01:26.500
It brings the animals
to this point.

01:26.533 --> 01:28.500
This is a natural trap.

01:28.533 --> 01:31.600
Everything from caribou,
to fish, to seals, to birds.

01:39.633 --> 01:41.533
Let your mum up.
You got the hot brass.

01:41.567 --> 01:43.967
You got to go to the back.
Carol. Carol.

01:44.067 --> 01:46.967
Okay, you need to get ready.
Hit them now!

01:47.067 --> 01:48.500
AGNES: Ting, start shooting!

01:48.533 --> 01:50.067
(GUNSHOTS)

01:52.233 --> 01:53.800
CHIP: Again. Again!

02:00.433 --> 02:02.333
CHIP: Get out of my way.
AGNES: It's deep, Chip.

02:02.367 --> 02:04.067
I got a knife.

02:04.900 --> 02:06.233
It's not that deep.

02:07.733 --> 02:09.500
Handful of ammo. I'm going.

02:14.667 --> 02:17.733
NARRATOR: Chip and Agnes
Hailstone are travelling
the Kiwalik River

02:17.767 --> 02:20.767
85 miles from their
native village of Noorvik.

02:20.800 --> 02:23.567
They will spend a summer
teaching their five daughters

02:23.600 --> 02:26.167
to hunt, gather
and live off the land.

02:28.167 --> 02:31.133
I'm looking for a blood trail
or for caribou tracks.

02:32.767 --> 02:36.667
It's gonna take us a little
manoeuvring to get to them.

02:37.633 --> 02:39.633
(SIGHS)

02:39.667 --> 02:43.500
A shot from a moving boat,
any moving boat,
is not very easy.

02:43.533 --> 02:47.100
We haven't even
set up our camp yet.
We just saw camp meat.

02:47.133 --> 02:52.067
We took the opportunity,
didn't work out so good.
Sometimes that happens.

02:52.067 --> 02:53.433
That's hunting.

02:53.467 --> 02:55.900
We're confident in ourselves
that it was a clean miss,

02:55.933 --> 02:57.467
and we're on our way
to camp now.

02:57.500 --> 03:00.933
Finish this up, go get
ourselves taken care of,
and go make a new home.

03:00.967 --> 03:02.367
We'll be here
for a few months.

03:02.400 --> 03:05.067
Frustrating when
an animal get away.

03:05.100 --> 03:08.300
That just takes time
to go chase after it.

03:10.533 --> 03:16.433
SUE: I think hand in hand with
living here, you have to be
brutally honest with yourself

03:16.467 --> 03:19.133
about what your strengths
and weaknesses are.

03:29.433 --> 03:32.567
My name is Susan Aikens,
and I'm the owner
of the Kavik River Camp.

03:32.600 --> 03:35.367
I live here year round.
I'm the sole resident
out here.

03:35.400 --> 03:37.067
It's not a town.
It's not a city.

03:37.067 --> 03:41.100
It's just me
and a GPS coordinate
on the North Slope of Alaska.

03:41.133 --> 03:46.067
Kavik River Camp is...
It's sort of like a unique
and twisted bed and breakfast.

03:46.067 --> 03:48.167
I am the only
refuelling station

03:48.200 --> 03:50.500
but one for the entire eastern
half of the North Slope.

03:50.533 --> 03:54.067
So, it's really the only
place of its kind

03:54.067 --> 03:58.067
for these planes to land,
and get fuel,
or a room, or help.

03:58.067 --> 04:01.500
You know, as owner
of the camp now,
I'm not anybody's employee.

04:01.533 --> 04:02.600
I own it.

04:02.633 --> 04:04.500
If the generator breaks down,

04:04.533 --> 04:09.200
um, I get flooded,
anything happens,
I go to myself to fix it.

04:09.233 --> 04:12.533
I don't call an owner and say,
"Boo-hoo, send the stuff up."

04:12.567 --> 04:14.733
I have to wake myself up
and get it done.

04:14.767 --> 04:18.333
If things broke down
and I lost everything,
I'd just have to lose it all.

04:18.367 --> 04:22.100
There's no guarantees
on any level here.
It's all challenge.

04:24.300 --> 04:27.467
Winter is on the way out.
Spring is on the way in.

04:28.733 --> 04:31.967
The snow and the ice
goes to liquid.

04:32.067 --> 04:34.933
The river is here,
camp is here,
the hills are here.

04:34.967 --> 04:38.333
It's... You know,
shit runs downhill, man.

04:38.367 --> 04:41.400
And I, you know...
I'm the cesspool
in the middle of it.

04:42.900 --> 04:44.200
I'm up in the high Arctic.

04:44.233 --> 04:46.200
I shouldn't have to
be telling my clients,

04:46.233 --> 04:50.233
"Don't forget the snorkel
and fins when you want
to go use the outhouse."

04:50.267 --> 04:51.967
The more of this
that stands around camp,

04:52.067 --> 04:55.800
it cannot drain
into the ground,
it's frozen down there.

04:55.833 --> 04:58.300
So, this has to go bye-bye.

04:58.333 --> 05:01.933
I need to help it live
where it wants to live.

05:01.967 --> 05:06.333
NARRATOR: Sue relies on income
from the summer months
to keep her business alive.

05:06.367 --> 05:10.600
Flooding in camp could
wash away her profits before
the season even begins.

05:13.600 --> 05:17.333
It's up to the bottoms of
the palettes on the generator.

05:17.367 --> 05:22.767
This is not what you want
to see by your electricity
or your motors.

05:22.800 --> 05:27.667
But I've got things that
are on the floor that are now
soaking in water.

05:27.700 --> 05:31.200
That's the highest
I've ever seen it get in here.
I gotta get it gone.

05:31.233 --> 05:35.133
Electricity and water?
A Sue-B-cue is not
what I wanna be.

05:35.167 --> 05:39.067
So, yeah. First things first,
I gotta get a pump
and start pumping.

05:42.067 --> 05:43.900
You know, this time of year
here at Kavik,

05:43.933 --> 05:47.933
um, you're really at the flux
of winter going into spring.

05:47.967 --> 05:52.700
I'm trying to run a business,
but the business
has to turn a profit.

05:52.733 --> 05:54.700
It doesn't matter
how cool the place is.

05:54.733 --> 05:57.367
I don't have
a profitable business,
then I can't stay.

05:57.400 --> 05:59.100
You know, there's just
things I've gotta do.

05:59.133 --> 06:01.300
My world opens up,
and I have two and a half,
three months

06:01.333 --> 06:03.367
to do whatever
construction I'm gonna do,

06:03.400 --> 06:05.633
improvements,
people in and out,

06:05.667 --> 06:09.933
make the money,
pay the money that
I need to pay to be here.

06:09.967 --> 06:13.367
You know, and then
winter comes in again.

06:15.100 --> 06:17.867
I got pumps working,
and it's gonna be continual.

06:17.900 --> 06:19.800
This is now daily
until it's gone.

06:19.833 --> 06:23.867
I need to keep it going
towards the river
and not towards camp.

06:23.900 --> 06:27.767
Next on the list,
gotta get in the bobcat
so I can attack the snow.

06:31.367 --> 06:33.133
I need to get
all the snow off of this.

06:33.167 --> 06:35.333
It's got a lot
of ice underneath it.

06:35.367 --> 06:38.267
I need to get it down
as far as I can,

06:38.300 --> 06:40.800
and let the sun
start melting it so that

06:40.833 --> 06:45.067
the water can go
from camp to the river
where it wants to live.

06:45.067 --> 06:48.233
It'll take the path
of least resistance
if it can find it.

06:48.267 --> 06:51.933
And as you can see,
yup, it's finding it.

06:51.967 --> 06:53.300
This is the beginning.

06:53.333 --> 06:58.100
I mean, you can
take a look around you,
and I am thawing.

06:58.633 --> 06:59.733
I am not thawed.

07:01.067 --> 07:02.800
ANDY:
This is the land of extremes.

07:02.833 --> 07:06.300
Everything out here
is extreme.
We go from light to dark.

07:06.333 --> 07:11.067
We go from cold
to warm, very, very quickly.

07:11.100 --> 07:15.333
It's constantly changing here,
and I think that's why
I love living out here.

07:25.233 --> 07:27.167
Let's go check out
the river, Jack.

07:28.267 --> 07:29.767
Let's go see
what break-up's doing.

07:29.800 --> 07:35.333
My name is Andy Bassich.
I'm at Calico Bluff
along the Yukon River.

07:35.367 --> 07:37.333
I live here
with my partner, Kate.

07:37.367 --> 07:40.700
For us living out here,
break-up is
the first of the year.

07:40.733 --> 07:43.633
Our life revolves completely
around the Yukon River,

07:43.667 --> 07:47.467
and what it throws at us
or what it provides for us.

07:47.500 --> 07:49.933
KATE: We really appreciate
what we have down here,

07:49.967 --> 07:54.467
and we know that
it can go anytime.
Any year.

07:54.500 --> 07:56.733
NARRATOR: Every spring,
the Yukon River breaks up,

07:56.767 --> 07:59.700
threatening the safety
and stability of the area.

07:59.733 --> 08:03.867
In 2009, Andy and Kate's
property was flooded,

08:03.900 --> 08:07.600
and they nearly
lost everything,
including their lives.

08:07.633 --> 08:11.600
KATE: Every April, every May,
it's a bit of a worry that...

08:11.633 --> 08:13.733
Is this gonna be
our last year here?

08:13.767 --> 08:17.933
ANDY: This is probably
one of the lowest
water break-ups we've seen,

08:17.967 --> 08:19.867
and I like this one
a lot better. (LAUGHS)

08:19.900 --> 08:23.467
Well, this... This is like
a merry-go-round compared
to a Ferris wheel last year.

08:26.133 --> 08:28.500
ANDY: The potential danger
of flooding is past,

08:28.533 --> 08:32.333
and I'm feeling like it's time
to get going on my projects.

08:32.367 --> 08:35.300
Last year, I built what
I called the doomsday raft

08:35.333 --> 08:37.267
because I was
expecting to be flooded.

08:37.300 --> 08:42.100
And it was basically
just a set of logs with
barrels underneath of it,

08:42.133 --> 08:45.500
and a platform that I put
a lot of my tools,
and snow machines,

08:45.533 --> 08:49.467
and important equipment
on so that it wouldn't get
damaged if we did flood.

08:49.500 --> 08:52.967
The idea is to turn it
into a workable space,

08:53.067 --> 08:54.733
and that means
putting a roof on it.

08:56.533 --> 08:59.100
The system that I want
to use for building this roof

08:59.133 --> 09:01.467
is called post and beam
timber framing.

09:01.500 --> 09:04.600
All right,
40 and a half inches.

09:04.633 --> 09:08.067
Most important thing
on any building
with your foundation

09:08.100 --> 09:10.367
is getting it levelled up
to begin with.

09:10.400 --> 09:13.167
36 and 7/16ths.

09:13.200 --> 09:15.933
So, we're within an eighth of
an inch all the way around.

09:15.967 --> 09:17.333
I'd call it good.

09:17.367 --> 09:19.733
Well, that went easy enough.

09:19.767 --> 09:22.067
ANDY:
Bottom line is, we've got
a lot of work ahead of us.

09:22.100 --> 09:25.667
It's gonna be
very challenging, but
that's why we live out here.

09:25.700 --> 09:27.233
We like that.

09:27.267 --> 09:29.967
GLENN: I'm not out here
for the isolation, but it goes
with the territory.

09:30.067 --> 09:33.067
I'm here for nature
and wilderness,

09:33.067 --> 09:37.100
and where there's much
wilderness left, there aren't
a whole lot of people.

09:52.600 --> 09:54.367
GLENN:
My name is Glenn Villeneuve.

09:54.400 --> 09:56.900
I have a camp in
the Brooks Range where
I live a subsistence lifestyle

09:56.933 --> 09:59.833
hunting and gathering,
living close to the land.

09:59.867 --> 10:02.400
I live simple,
and I love nature.
I love the wilderness.

10:02.433 --> 10:05.533
This is the last place
in the world where there's
this kind of wilderness.

10:05.567 --> 10:07.133
Where I could come
and live this way.

10:11.667 --> 10:14.067
There's something over there.

10:14.100 --> 10:15.833
There's an animal
in the woods right there.

10:15.867 --> 10:19.733
He's behind some spruce trees,
but he's gonna come
into an opening right now.

10:22.467 --> 10:25.800
Hey, bear! He probably
smells this fish I'm eating.

10:31.333 --> 10:32.433
Go away.

10:35.433 --> 10:38.033
How to deal with a bear
is to talk to the bear.

10:38.067 --> 10:39.900
Because then they
know you're a human,

10:39.933 --> 10:43.067
and bears aren't interested in
messing around with humans.

10:43.100 --> 10:45.000
Nothing for you over here.

10:54.900 --> 10:56.700
When I first moved here,

10:56.733 --> 11:00.400
it was very common
for bears to walk
right down the beach here.

11:00.433 --> 11:02.400
After I was here
for one or two summers,

11:02.433 --> 11:05.200
they stopped walking
by the front of
the cabin very often.

11:05.233 --> 11:07.467
They didn't want
to come into the yard.

11:07.500 --> 11:10.567
The bear went that way.
I'm going over this way
to build a bridge today.

11:10.600 --> 11:12.800
Hopefully, I won't see
any more of him today.

11:17.433 --> 11:19.867
NARRATOR: Living 60 miles
from the nearest road,

11:19.900 --> 11:22.933
finding food is a constant
challenge for Glenn.

11:22.967 --> 11:27.767
Having access to
his hunting grounds
is key to his survival.

11:27.800 --> 11:31.667
GLENN: Just about a quarter
mile from here there's
a creek that I cross often,

11:31.700 --> 11:33.500
and I've been
crossing on a tree

11:33.533 --> 11:35.933
that had naturally fallen
across the creek years ago.

11:35.967 --> 11:37.600
But it washed out recently,

11:37.633 --> 11:39.600
so I can't get across
there any more without
getting my feet wet.

11:39.633 --> 11:41.567
It'd be nice to make
some type of a bridge

11:41.600 --> 11:44.267
so I can go across the creek
without getting wet.

11:44.300 --> 11:46.067
I need to make some
new kind of bridge.

11:46.100 --> 11:47.633
Imagine this here
is the creek.

11:47.667 --> 11:52.300
What I'm doing, I'm laying
a log here, and a log here,

11:52.333 --> 11:55.333
and where a tree
is growing here,

11:55.367 --> 11:58.333
I'm gonna try and fell it
right across those two logs.

11:58.367 --> 12:01.233
Then I'll be able to
walk across the creek,

12:01.267 --> 12:04.767
right there,
without getting my feet wet.

12:04.800 --> 12:07.267
This would be a great spot
for me to cross
for years to come.

12:07.300 --> 12:08.867
Now I just have
to go through there.

12:08.900 --> 12:12.500
The creek's not very
wide here, but it's deep.

12:12.533 --> 12:15.067
I'm taking my boots off,
and I'm taking my pants off

12:15.067 --> 12:17.200
so I can cross without
getting them all wet.

12:17.233 --> 12:19.067
And I'd have to go
through this every time

12:19.067 --> 12:20.900
when I'm moose hunting
every day.

12:20.933 --> 12:24.167
Sometimes I walk
across here twice a day.

12:24.200 --> 12:27.267
So, this is just gonna
make life so much faster

12:27.300 --> 12:30.067
and more efficient when I get
to this creek in the future.

12:32.100 --> 12:35.433
The water is ice cold.

12:37.867 --> 12:39.067
Oh!

12:43.800 --> 12:46.067
That's cold water.

12:46.067 --> 12:50.300
Out here you don't have
to try to stay in shape.

12:50.333 --> 12:52.900
There are jobs
that have to be done
that take physical work.

12:52.933 --> 12:56.133
The way I live without
machinery, there's no choice.

12:56.167 --> 12:57.633
Over on the other
side of the creek,

12:57.667 --> 12:59.700
it's a good place
to hunt moose.

12:59.733 --> 13:01.967
And it'd be really nice
if I could just go across
a log over there

13:02.067 --> 13:03.767
rather than
go through the water.

13:03.800 --> 13:06.567
The water out here is cold.
This isn't the tropics.
This is the Arctic.

13:06.600 --> 13:08.900
Even in the summer
when it gets really warm,

13:08.933 --> 13:12.067
the water doesn't
ever get warm.
It's still cold.

13:12.067 --> 13:15.800
And if you get wet,
and you get cold,
you can get hypothermic.

13:15.833 --> 13:19.133
In the wintertime I've never
felt in danger of hypothermia,

13:19.167 --> 13:21.167
but in the summer I have.

13:21.200 --> 13:23.667
If I get wet,
and then I get cold,

13:23.700 --> 13:26.533
and I can't build a fire,
I got big problems.

13:26.567 --> 13:29.300
So, I like to stay
dry when I can.

13:31.167 --> 13:34.533
CHIP: I'm the hunter.
My wife is a hunter.
My kids are hunters.

13:34.567 --> 13:39.067
I have enough respect
for this land to be aware
that it can eat me too.

13:39.100 --> 13:41.067
And it probably will someday.

13:50.800 --> 13:53.567
AGNES: Hold on, girls!
CHIP: Hold on.
I'm gonna ramp it.

13:53.600 --> 13:57.667
AGNES: Whoo! Yeah. Yep.

13:57.700 --> 13:59.500
We've got to unload the boat.

13:59.533 --> 14:01.567
We'll take our things
to high ground.

14:01.600 --> 14:03.567
We'll make sure the boat
is safe where it is.

14:03.600 --> 14:06.100
I'm gonna tie it off,
and then we're gonna
go put up our stuff. Okay?

14:06.133 --> 14:08.667
We got it here dry,
let's keep it dry.

14:08.700 --> 14:10.067
NARRATOR: For the Hailstones,

14:10.067 --> 14:12.967
setting up camp
along the Kiwalik River
is a summer tradition

14:13.067 --> 14:17.267
and a way to build up
their supply of food to
survive the months ahead.

14:17.300 --> 14:19.167
Everything over here, girls.

14:19.200 --> 14:20.733
AGNES:
Our children go to school,

14:20.767 --> 14:25.067
but there's also time
where we teach them
subsistence lifestyle.

14:25.067 --> 14:27.633
CHIP: The goal for summer
here is to
spend time with my kids

14:27.667 --> 14:29.433
and my family, teaching them.

14:29.467 --> 14:31.767
It's absolutely necessary
that we teach our kids
these survival skills

14:31.800 --> 14:33.367
and these living skills.

14:33.400 --> 14:35.133
You're making them
self-sufficient.

14:35.167 --> 14:37.533
You know, you give
them exercise,
you give them adventure.

14:37.567 --> 14:39.567
AGNES: They need
to learn to survive

14:39.600 --> 14:42.500
and, you know,
to pass down to their kids

14:42.533 --> 14:45.433
and try to keep it in our
Inupiat traditional manner.

14:45.467 --> 14:48.667
It's something that you
have to be involved in.

14:48.700 --> 14:51.667
I'm just undoing the tent,
and the first thing to do
is put up some shelter

14:51.700 --> 14:54.200
so we can get out
of this cold, cold, cold wind.

14:54.233 --> 14:56.433
Make everybody happy with
a little bit of fire and heat.

14:57.933 --> 14:59.733
The kids grew up here
for quite some time.

14:59.767 --> 15:03.633
The older kids grew up here.
This is actually
Ting's first home.

15:03.667 --> 15:07.267
It's a good feeling to
be able to come out here,
live out here,

15:07.300 --> 15:10.300
and happy to have
my sisters hunting with me.

15:10.333 --> 15:13.733
So that they could know
and learn it too.

15:13.767 --> 15:15.967
CHIP: You know,
your best friends are
the ones that you work with.

15:16.067 --> 15:18.633
And I like to work
with my kids and show
them what I'm doing.

15:18.667 --> 15:20.667
And we like to go to sleep
tired at the end of each day,

15:20.700 --> 15:23.367
and have something to
look forward to and something
to show for our efforts.

15:25.967 --> 15:27.833
CHIP: We got a fire going.

15:27.867 --> 15:31.200
Gonna warm this place up.
We're gonna dry everybody out.

15:31.233 --> 15:33.767
For the first night tonight
we're all gonna crowd
into the tent here,

15:33.800 --> 15:36.200
into the tepee.
And we're gonna crash out.

15:37.967 --> 15:39.900
At the end of the day,
when you're tired
and you're hungry,

15:39.933 --> 15:43.400
basically most people
wanna get dry, get warm,
and go to bed.

15:43.433 --> 15:46.367
And, uh, that's why
we do shelter first.

15:48.633 --> 15:50.933
ANDY:
Every day is a workday here.

15:50.967 --> 15:53.600
Can't afford to sit around
and not do anything out here.

15:53.633 --> 15:55.733
You gotta get moving
every single day.

16:12.933 --> 16:16.333
Springtime is here.
For me that means
building mode.

16:16.367 --> 16:18.667
And so, I'm gonna be doing
some timber framing.

16:18.700 --> 16:20.100
Learning a new skill,

16:20.133 --> 16:24.833
and applying that skill
to putting a roof over
my doomsday raft,

16:24.867 --> 16:28.067
and turning that into
a workshop for me.

16:31.167 --> 16:32.533
Not enough.

16:32.567 --> 16:35.700
The ends need to be tapered
so that it fits properly.

16:35.733 --> 16:39.433
You know, when you live
out like this you've really
got to figure out,

16:39.467 --> 16:42.400
you know, the best ways
to divide the labour.

16:43.867 --> 16:47.733
I've cut a lot of the material
right now, but I need, uh,

16:47.767 --> 16:51.067
five more of these 6 x 6s.

16:51.067 --> 16:52.967
The most important thing
for me right now

16:53.067 --> 16:56.200
is not to make
any major mistakes,

16:56.233 --> 16:58.767
because this is all I have
left for building material.

16:58.800 --> 17:01.767
NARRATOR: Living remotely,
resources are hard earned.

17:01.800 --> 17:06.100
One mistake could cost
Andy days of work
and thousands of dollars.

17:14.600 --> 17:18.167
On my second cut when
I went to cut it for length,

17:18.200 --> 17:20.567
I had that sticking up,
so it raised this end up.

17:20.600 --> 17:23.900
So, I went from
six inches to five inches,

17:23.933 --> 17:26.467
and that sucks, because
that was a really good log.

17:28.067 --> 17:29.633
These aren't easy to come by.

17:29.667 --> 17:33.267
(LAUGHS) I gotta go out,
cut them a couple miles
away from home,

17:33.300 --> 17:35.967
limb them, drag them in
with a snow machine,

17:36.067 --> 17:38.067
stack them up,
roll them onto the mill.

17:38.100 --> 17:40.233
It's not easy to
come by this material,

17:40.267 --> 17:43.833
so when I screw up a good one,
it kind of pisses me off.

17:43.867 --> 17:48.733
KATE: It's a new... A new
thing for him to do this post
and beam construction,

17:48.767 --> 17:50.867
and sometimes he gets hurried.

17:50.900 --> 17:53.733
And if you don't have
the patience to slow down

17:53.767 --> 17:55.500
and just think about
what you're doing, and...

17:55.533 --> 17:59.767
Or getting overconfident
with what you're doing,
things go wrong.

18:01.967 --> 18:05.433
Okay, see. So, this is
where... Where it becomes
kind of tricky,

18:05.467 --> 18:07.133
trying to get
everything to go together.

18:07.167 --> 18:08.600
ANDY: We're at
a really critical point.

18:08.633 --> 18:10.767
I've gotta make sure that
these centre post pegs

18:10.800 --> 18:14.400
are gonna fall into the notch
as I raise this up.

18:14.433 --> 18:17.567
I'd rather have my peg
just be slightly loose,

18:17.600 --> 18:20.967
than have problems with it
splitting out the wood.

18:21.067 --> 18:22.333
That one's perfect.

18:27.300 --> 18:30.067
Ooh, Kate. God damn it.

18:30.300 --> 18:31.767
Fuck!

18:31.800 --> 18:35.533
I'm gonna drive
the pegs, okay?
That's really fucking bad.

18:37.133 --> 18:38.367
God damn it.

18:40.867 --> 18:44.300
The problem that
I'm having right now is that
my holes are off centre

18:44.333 --> 18:47.467
just a little bit more than
the dowels are tapered for.

18:47.500 --> 18:50.300
And so as the dowel starts to
come through the other side,

18:50.333 --> 18:52.833
it wants to split the wood
out on the backside.

18:52.867 --> 18:54.600
And that's not good,

18:54.633 --> 18:57.067
'cause that's gonna
take a lot of the strength
out of the joint.

18:58.267 --> 19:00.167
KATE:
This is all about precision,

19:00.200 --> 19:05.333
so I guess when something
is off just a wee bit,
it can backfire in a hurry.

19:05.367 --> 19:09.600
What I'm doing right now
is getting ready
to build a gin pole rig,

19:09.633 --> 19:11.567
so I can lift this thing.

19:11.600 --> 19:14.367
Getting that first part up
is gonna be the hard part.

19:14.400 --> 19:16.567
That's the job
of the gin pole.

19:16.600 --> 19:19.267
As it comes up,
the second thing
I have to worry about

19:19.300 --> 19:22.067
is it going too far,
falling over.

19:22.067 --> 19:24.467
And then the third thing
is as it comes up,

19:24.500 --> 19:28.467
getting my little pegs to go
into the holes right there.

19:28.500 --> 19:31.633
Once they're started,
I think we're all good.

19:36.700 --> 19:39.167
I'm gonna get it up probably
about like this degree.

19:39.200 --> 19:41.600
Try and get
those pegs lined up,

19:41.633 --> 19:45.133
and then it's that last bit
when it comes up that
you're gonna have to

19:45.167 --> 19:49.300
have a little bit of tension,
and then just,
I'll go a little bit,

19:49.333 --> 19:50.633
and you let out a little bit.

19:50.667 --> 19:51.700
Can we do a little practise?

19:51.733 --> 19:52.933
Nope, there is no practise.

19:52.967 --> 19:54.333
Okay.

19:54.367 --> 19:55.733
Do or die, babe.

19:57.733 --> 20:00.333
Every day counts
out here in the summertime.

20:00.367 --> 20:03.133
So, every morning I wake up,
and I gotta be on task.

20:03.167 --> 20:09.000
I gotta get humping,
get these jobs done,
and stay on schedule.

20:09.033 --> 20:13.300
I'm gonna just push it
forward manually
and get those notches in.

20:15.933 --> 20:17.467
Okay. Stop it there.

20:21.900 --> 20:23.267
All right. We're in.

20:23.300 --> 20:25.233
-You got fingers left?
-Yup.

20:27.900 --> 20:30.867
All my bracing here
looks nice and tight.

20:30.900 --> 20:32.733
These joints
are tight right here.

20:33.500 --> 20:34.867
So, that's important,

20:34.900 --> 20:38.633
'cause this is what
keeps it from racking
one way or the other.

20:38.667 --> 20:41.567
It's time to start cutting
and measuring for round two.

20:43.767 --> 20:45.167
Looks like a new house.

20:46.533 --> 20:49.900
GLENN:
This is a very free lifestyle

20:49.933 --> 20:55.467
because out here
nature dictates what I do,
but other people don't.

21:07.300 --> 21:10.300
This is the tree
I'd like to use.

21:10.333 --> 21:12.233
NARRATOR:
With limited food sources,

21:12.267 --> 21:15.833
building a bridge will
allow Glenn better access
to hunting grounds.

21:15.867 --> 21:17.367
It's in a good place.

21:17.400 --> 21:20.933
Back a little ways from
the bank, and I think
it's just long enough.

21:20.967 --> 21:22.400
Problem is...

21:24.300 --> 21:27.700
It looks like it's
leaning back just a little.

21:27.733 --> 21:29.967
Naturally, it would
wanna fall that way,

21:30.067 --> 21:32.733
but I want it
to fall this way.

21:32.767 --> 21:37.833
I think it's close enough
that I can make it fall over
this way with a wedge.

21:37.867 --> 21:39.333
I'm gonna give it a try.

21:49.300 --> 21:50.300
Yeah!

21:52.400 --> 21:54.533
Now that I've got
the tree down,
I'm gonna limb it,

21:54.567 --> 21:58.267
and I'm gonna cut
through it a couple more times
in order to make

21:58.300 --> 22:00.733
bases for my bridge.

22:02.533 --> 22:04.467
I'm almost through.

22:04.500 --> 22:06.567
It's a big tree
to cut with an axe.

22:07.967 --> 22:09.333
Got it.

22:09.367 --> 22:11.467
Now, I've got two logs
for the foundation
of my bridge.

22:11.500 --> 22:13.667
I just have to figure out how
to move them into place.

22:20.067 --> 22:21.500
This is a heavy log.

22:25.567 --> 22:27.067
About there.

22:27.067 --> 22:30.067
Just making a little notch,
so the bridge
will be more stable.

22:32.100 --> 22:34.767
There. That keeps it
from rolling.

22:34.800 --> 22:38.133
I got a log here I need to
move to the other side.
I've got a rope tied on it.

22:38.167 --> 22:41.700
Now I just need to cross
this creek one more time
and pull this log across.

22:45.667 --> 22:48.333
Ow! I wanna get everything
in position on that side.

22:48.367 --> 22:50.100
Gotta make one more crossing.
Cut this tree down.

22:50.133 --> 22:53.667
It's gonna fall
perfectly across there
if everything goes right.

22:53.700 --> 22:56.067
If everything goes wrong
it could fall
in the opposite direction.

22:56.067 --> 22:57.433
Let's hope not.

22:58.500 --> 22:59.700
I made it.

22:59.733 --> 23:01.233
SUE: Spring wants to happen.

23:01.267 --> 23:03.700
Winter is giving him
a run for its money.

23:03.733 --> 23:07.067
You know, you've got
two of your main seasons
just going head to head.

23:07.100 --> 23:08.467
Boom. Who's gonna win?

23:25.900 --> 23:28.500
What I'm seeing
next to the dining hall,

23:28.533 --> 23:31.733
unfortunately,
is back down to square one.

23:31.767 --> 23:35.067
It's water.
You gonna come for a swim?

23:35.067 --> 23:38.233
Went to bed,
and a bunch of rain came in.

23:38.267 --> 23:40.067
Spring is rapidly approaching,

23:40.100 --> 23:44.133
but somebody...
Somebody invited old man
winter to the spring party

23:44.167 --> 23:45.933
without me realising it,

23:45.967 --> 23:47.767
and I got
several inches of snow.

23:47.800 --> 23:50.167
I don't know how much
water I've got
in the shop right now.

23:50.200 --> 23:53.267
I can guarantee if I'm seeing
it here, it's there too.

23:53.300 --> 23:55.067
In my shop I have
my generators.

23:55.067 --> 23:58.567
They're up on palettes,
but it's possible
that it goes higher.

23:58.600 --> 24:01.400
So, if it's getting close to
the battery and the electrics,

24:01.433 --> 24:03.067
I've gotta get that water out.

24:06.867 --> 24:08.133
My gosh.

24:11.267 --> 24:14.067
I got more water in here.

24:14.067 --> 24:17.333
Last night, I had this whole
area down to gravel.

24:17.367 --> 24:19.967
And now it's water up to here.

24:20.067 --> 24:25.400
So, I've definitely gotten
a lot of water
that's melted and run in.

24:25.433 --> 24:27.400
I'm gonna have to
be Suzie on the spot,

24:27.433 --> 24:30.900
and get in there
with both feet, both pumps,

24:30.933 --> 24:34.767
and instead of letting those
pumps rest as much over
the... Over the evening,

24:34.800 --> 24:38.167
I may just have to keep it
on a round the clock thing.

24:38.200 --> 24:40.467
Burning up a pump
is a $5,000 mistake.

24:40.500 --> 24:44.067
Letting camp flood is
a couple $100,000 mistake.

24:45.400 --> 24:47.400
ANDY: It's gonna be
a challenging summer for us.

24:47.433 --> 24:49.567
I don't run from that.
I embrace that.

24:49.600 --> 24:54.433
I embrace the challenge,
and I embrace the physicality
of living out here.

25:04.100 --> 25:07.167
All right. Gonna go together.

25:11.500 --> 25:14.267
I'm kind of racing against
what looks like a rainstorm.

25:14.300 --> 25:18.500
I'm really hoping
I can get this last bent up
before it starts raining.

25:18.533 --> 25:21.800
It's time to kind of
beat the clock,

25:21.833 --> 25:23.567
and try and beat this storm.

25:25.200 --> 25:27.300
NARRATOR: With Alaska's
unpredictable weather,

25:27.333 --> 25:31.400
Andy is creating a structure
that will allow him
to work in any condition.

25:32.800 --> 25:34.600
Okay. Moment of truth.

25:36.100 --> 25:38.500
KATE: There's so much
to be done this summer.

25:38.533 --> 25:41.733
It's mind boggling,
and I don't...
I don't know

25:41.767 --> 25:45.400
if these two old bodies
can handle it,
but we're sure gonna...

25:46.067 --> 25:47.433
We're sure gonna try.

25:55.067 --> 25:56.400
Ooh, that's not good.

25:57.833 --> 25:59.533
One of those things that
happens at the end of the day

25:59.567 --> 26:01.433
when you're tired,
and you wanna finish up,

26:01.467 --> 26:06.167
and you're fighting,
trying to beat a storm coming,
taking shortcuts.

26:07.267 --> 26:09.467
Shortcuts are never shortcuts.

26:10.833 --> 26:12.533
I should know that by now.

26:16.067 --> 26:17.733
I see what I did.
I measured wrong.

26:17.767 --> 26:21.233
That was supposed to be one
inch, not an inch and a half.

26:21.267 --> 26:24.533
So, that put the
hole too close
to the end of the tenon.

26:26.300 --> 26:29.300
Ouch. Fuck. (LAUGHS)

26:31.567 --> 26:33.200
Getting tired.

26:36.400 --> 26:37.567
Yay.

26:40.867 --> 26:42.700
All right.
Well, I got her done.

26:43.867 --> 26:48.300
And I'm pooped out, (LAUGHS)

26:48.333 --> 26:53.700
but it feels really sturdy,
and it looks good.

26:53.733 --> 26:57.100
And it'll look really good
once I get some metal on it.

26:57.133 --> 26:58.567
GLENN:
Really hard physical work,

26:58.600 --> 27:02.967
and a very intellectually
challenging lifestyle

27:03.067 --> 27:07.367
don't often go together
in the modern world
the way they do out here.

27:16.733 --> 27:19.767
I'm just looking at the trees,

27:19.800 --> 27:24.667
and what might happen
when I fell that tree that's
gonna make my bridge.

27:24.700 --> 27:27.833
I got the base on this side.
I got the base
on the other side.

27:27.867 --> 27:29.700
I just have to cut that tree,

27:29.733 --> 27:33.533
and get it to fall
straight across here,
and I'll be all set.

27:33.567 --> 27:37.833
This tree right here wants to
fall the opposite direction

27:37.867 --> 27:39.967
from where I want it to go.

27:40.067 --> 27:47.333
But it's a slight enough lean
that I'm hoping I can push it
over the other way.

27:47.367 --> 27:48.567
I'm gonna try.

27:51.933 --> 27:54.700
This notch has
to be perpendicular

27:56.100 --> 27:58.167
to the direction
I want the tree to fall.

28:01.067 --> 28:04.800
And it's a very narrow space
that I'm trying
to get it to fall into.

28:09.567 --> 28:14.067
As I'm cutting in there,
the tree is gonna
wanna fall that way.

28:15.467 --> 28:19.567
I'm gonna cut just
a little higher up than
the base of my notch.

28:20.467 --> 28:22.600
Just a couple inches
up higher.

28:22.633 --> 28:26.200
And I gotta be
really careful not to drop it
on myself obviously.

28:26.233 --> 28:29.067
I have to get it,
get it back to about here

28:29.067 --> 28:31.233
before I can really wedge it.

28:31.267 --> 28:37.133
And the problem is,
I can't seem to get this saw
to go in any further now.

28:37.167 --> 28:39.433
'Cause it's getting
a little bit pinched.

28:50.167 --> 28:52.067
The wedge is too thin.

28:52.067 --> 28:54.133
It's getting pushed
down into the wood.

28:54.167 --> 28:56.233
See if I put
this axe right here,

28:57.700 --> 28:59.267
it's much broader.

28:59.300 --> 29:03.133
I really have to get
something pretty darn heavy
to pound on that with.

29:03.167 --> 29:04.533
I've gotta think about this.

29:09.067 --> 29:12.800
All I have is this axe.
Nothing to pound it.

29:15.333 --> 29:17.533
Look out! It's going!
It's going!

29:22.067 --> 29:23.867
Yes! Right in the right place.

29:23.900 --> 29:28.733
Look at that. (CHEERING)
Look at this.

29:28.767 --> 29:33.133
Awesome! All I gotta do
is limb it, and I got
a bridge right here.

29:33.867 --> 29:35.567
Look at that. (LAUGHS)

29:35.600 --> 29:37.867
Mother Nature
helped me out again.

29:37.900 --> 29:40.167
I just had to wait for
a little breeze to come.

29:40.200 --> 29:41.967
Look at that. Beautiful.

29:42.067 --> 29:45.200
The notch went in here
and down like this.

29:45.233 --> 29:48.600
And then I cut in from here,
and this was the hinge.

29:48.633 --> 29:51.933
The problem was the blade
started getting pinched,

29:51.967 --> 29:53.900
and I couldn't
saw any further.

29:53.933 --> 29:55.700
And I pounded in this wedge.

29:55.733 --> 29:59.300
The wedge is too narrow,
and it squashed into the wood.

29:59.333 --> 30:02.500
But then the breeze came up,

30:02.533 --> 30:05.167
and just that breeze
is what pushed it over.

30:05.200 --> 30:08.567
Put the tree
right where I wanted it.
It couldn't be better.

30:08.600 --> 30:09.600
This is perfect.

30:11.600 --> 30:14.900
All I gotta do now is
cut the limbs off the top.

30:14.933 --> 30:17.167
This is just gonna make
an awesome bridge.

30:33.967 --> 30:36.800
Fortunes can change
pretty fast out here.

30:36.833 --> 30:39.800
One minute I was worried
I wasn't gonna get that tree
to fall in the right spot,

30:39.833 --> 30:43.000
and then the wind
blew it down exactly
where I wanted it.

30:43.033 --> 30:45.400
Beautiful. I love this bridge.

30:46.133 --> 30:48.200
This is a beautiful bridge.

30:48.967 --> 30:50.467
I can just walk
across here now.

30:50.500 --> 30:52.767
When I'm out
moose hunting in the fall,

30:52.800 --> 30:55.867
I won't have to take
my clothes off every time
I go across the creek.

30:55.900 --> 30:57.400
My bridge is done.

30:58.800 --> 31:00.667
That's a beautiful bridge.

31:03.300 --> 31:06.433
SUE: There's this pattern
that you must follow

31:06.467 --> 31:09.367
to be a productive person
within the society.

31:09.400 --> 31:12.067
Being able to do
what I want, when I want,

31:12.067 --> 31:14.433
and how I want is why
I live out here alone.

31:23.633 --> 31:25.900
You know, right now,
it's a waiting game.

31:25.933 --> 31:30.800
NARRATOR: While the pumps work
around the clock, Sue tackles
another spring task.

31:30.833 --> 31:34.333
SUE: So, while I've got time,
I'm going to do some laundry
and just wait it out.

31:38.633 --> 31:43.600
270 to 300 days
is my average for being
totally alone out here,

31:43.633 --> 31:46.467
dealing with
my solitary lifestyle.

31:46.500 --> 31:48.933
Over the course of my
50 years, I've picked up
a lot of habits,

31:48.967 --> 31:53.733
traits that culminate
in me being successful
at being very isolated.

31:55.967 --> 31:58.767
You ready to jump in
afterwards, Erms? Huh?

32:00.533 --> 32:04.100
This is not a lifestyle that
you wander into blindly,

32:04.133 --> 32:06.367
and go "Oh, I think
I'll do this. It's cool!"

32:08.533 --> 32:10.500
To do it here
is a conscious choice

32:10.533 --> 32:14.800
that you're going to work
and earn whatever
money you can,

32:14.833 --> 32:18.433
however you can to afford
a lifestyle that you care for.

32:20.467 --> 32:22.700
I did not choose
to leave society.

32:23.967 --> 32:26.200
I am just living my own life.

32:27.833 --> 32:30.200
My own life is very content.

32:31.933 --> 32:34.367
I find myself
incredibly entertaining.

32:37.833 --> 32:42.433
I don't care where you live
or what you do for a living.

32:42.467 --> 32:45.067
The only person
you're guaranteed

32:45.067 --> 32:49.333
you're born with
and you die with
is the one in the mirror.

32:49.367 --> 32:52.467
The only skin that is
not going to leave you
until you pass away

32:52.500 --> 32:55.267
is the one you're born with,
your birthday suit.

32:55.300 --> 32:59.067
Better make sure
that's somebody that
you enjoy being around.

33:01.700 --> 33:04.933
CHIP: I've got my gunners,
and I'm the driver.

33:04.967 --> 33:06.500
And we're all
a crew or a team.

33:06.533 --> 33:08.133
And we'll be
teaching our children.

33:08.167 --> 33:11.533
If we catch something,
they'll see the process
from beginning to end.

33:11.567 --> 33:15.200
From death, till it feeds us
and gives us life.

33:18.267 --> 33:22.100
We spent the first night in
a... All together kind of
clustered up in the tent,

33:22.133 --> 33:23.733
but that's because
we got here so late,

33:23.767 --> 33:26.067
and spent a lot of time
chasing caribou
that we didn't catch.

33:26.100 --> 33:29.500
First thing you have to do
is have a place to store your
things out of the weather.

33:29.533 --> 33:31.267
And being dry in
the Arctic is the big thing.

33:31.300 --> 33:33.833
It can be 40 below,
you get wet, you're gonna die.

33:33.867 --> 33:35.333
It can be 40 above,

33:35.367 --> 33:38.067
if you get wet
you're gonna get chilled
and you'll be miserable.

33:38.100 --> 33:39.633
We're not into that at all.

33:39.667 --> 33:42.767
We're into living,
not just surviving,
so, no misery here.

33:43.667 --> 33:44.867
(WHISTLES)

33:44.900 --> 33:47.067
Um, we're just finishing
up a place to work.

33:47.100 --> 33:48.833
This is a place where

33:48.867 --> 33:50.767
if it's really bad weather,

33:50.800 --> 33:53.800
and these women want
to cut fish, or cut meat,

33:53.833 --> 33:55.833
or the kids wanna play,
just hang out,

33:55.867 --> 33:59.400
we build a hut like this,
and this is kind of like
a waterproof shelter place

33:59.433 --> 34:01.267
where everybody can work
and do their things.

34:01.300 --> 34:03.733
-It needs to go over this way.
-It's already made
to be tied down, babe.

34:03.767 --> 34:05.500
If you just keep pulling
it this way, it'll be good.

34:05.533 --> 34:07.800
We separate our cooking
and meat cutting facility

34:07.833 --> 34:11.800
from our sleeping facility,
from our kids'
little bedrooms.

34:11.833 --> 34:14.833
There's a lot of good,
good family time out here.

34:14.867 --> 34:17.167
We're usually
working together.

34:17.200 --> 34:19.600
It's just like bonding.
It makes you closer.

34:19.633 --> 34:21.967
We got the shelter
taken care of, which is
a really good thing.

34:22.067 --> 34:25.200
'Cause we need to be
able to shelter ourselves,
and keep our stuff dry,

34:25.233 --> 34:26.800
and then now
we're gonna work on food.

34:26.833 --> 34:28.767
Agnes, I'm gonna take off.

34:28.800 --> 34:33.233
Okay. I'm just gonna keep
fixing this, and arranging
it the way I want it.

34:33.267 --> 34:35.233
-I'll be back with firewood.
-Okay.

34:35.267 --> 34:36.233
Be safe!

34:36.267 --> 34:37.800
Yup, yup. See you guys later.

34:37.833 --> 34:39.767
It's a very diverse place.

34:39.800 --> 34:41.367
You know, you've got
the trees upriver. You've
got the ocean downriver.

34:41.400 --> 34:43.167
We got the mountains
all around us,

34:43.200 --> 34:45.867
so we have chances
of seeing almost anything
and everything.

34:45.900 --> 34:48.367
If we go get firewood,
we have a possibility
of getting geese,

34:48.400 --> 34:50.367
getting swans,
getting any kind of birds.

34:50.400 --> 34:53.567
There's caribou
running around.

34:53.600 --> 34:56.467
Caribou, caribou, caribou!
There's lots of
caribou crossing.

34:57.633 --> 35:02.467
-Get your gun. Ting! Caribou!
-Where?

35:06.733 --> 35:10.467
Come on. Shh!
Bunch of caribou coming over.

35:11.733 --> 35:13.200
I love caribou.

35:14.933 --> 35:17.667
Oh, wow.
There's a ton of them.

35:17.700 --> 35:19.967
You know, animals don't
tell you when they're
gonna show up.

35:20.067 --> 35:22.067
You gotta be ready
basically anytime.

35:22.067 --> 35:23.800
You gotta have
a gun for every occasion.

35:23.833 --> 35:26.733
You gotta have your eyes open,
and you have to pay attention.

35:26.767 --> 35:28.433
(WHISPERING)
Okay, here they come.

35:28.467 --> 35:30.333
They're still just
getting to the water.

35:30.367 --> 35:32.400
All right, they're
just about to cross.

35:33.433 --> 35:37.067
Now.
Sit down and shoot.

35:37.067 --> 35:39.067
There it goes, Ting. Now.

35:39.067 --> 35:40.433
(GUNSHOTS) Yee, too high.

35:40.467 --> 35:41.667
Again.

35:41.700 --> 35:42.700
(GUNSHOTS)

35:43.333 --> 35:45.067
-Jeez.
-(GUNSHOTS)

35:45.700 --> 35:48.133
(GUNSHOTS)

35:49.967 --> 35:52.067
It's not going anywhere.
He's... They're dying.

35:52.100 --> 35:53.167
(GUNSHOTS)

35:53.200 --> 35:55.200
-Oh, your mum got it.
-Like that.

35:55.233 --> 35:57.433
Those are the two.
That's it.

35:57.467 --> 35:59.900
No more.
No other caribou. Those two.

36:00.067 --> 36:03.833
One wounded,
and it's standing there,
but it ain't going anywheres.

36:03.867 --> 36:08.967
We have one right here,
and it's just down, but it's
trying to get back up.

36:09.067 --> 36:10.900
I'm gonna go get the boat.

36:10.933 --> 36:13.100
We're gonna cross the river
and get the two caribou that
the women were shooting.

36:13.133 --> 36:15.433
We try to get all of our kids
into the caribou game.

36:15.467 --> 36:16.667
That's what we call it,
it's the game.

36:16.700 --> 36:18.333
-The game of getting game.
-Come on.

36:20.533 --> 36:23.167
We gotta go fast
'cause we have a wounded one
across there,

36:23.200 --> 36:24.833
and we don't want
him to get away.

36:24.867 --> 36:26.700
We don't wanna track him.
We don't wanna
carry him forever.

36:30.067 --> 36:31.267
Follow me, Ag.

36:34.500 --> 36:35.567
He's right there.

36:38.467 --> 36:39.367
(GUNSHOTS)

36:39.400 --> 36:41.067
There you go. Now he's down.

36:41.100 --> 36:43.167
AGNES: This is the place
where we like to sit and stay,

36:43.200 --> 36:46.733
and just wait for all
the animals to come to us.

36:46.767 --> 36:49.500
So, we're blessed to
have this real great spot.

36:49.533 --> 36:51.533
-That's a good-sized one.
-He's done.

36:51.567 --> 36:54.867
Yesterday we had the same...
The same thing come to us.

36:54.900 --> 36:56.233
Except for we were in a boat.

36:56.267 --> 36:58.300
We were in
a heavily loaded boat,
and we had no speed,

36:58.333 --> 37:00.633
and shooting from a tippy boat
like this is kind of crazy.

37:00.667 --> 37:03.633
But today they were here just
shooting at moving animals,

37:03.667 --> 37:06.333
and the animals
lurch and move,
and you know how it goes.

37:06.367 --> 37:08.933
You can't just connect
every time, but today,
they've connected.

37:08.967 --> 37:10.167
It's a bit better
than yesterday,

37:10.200 --> 37:12.267
and this rounds out
our getting camp ready

37:12.300 --> 37:14.067
because now
we have fresh meat.

37:14.100 --> 37:17.067
We'll be eating good tonight,
and tomorrow, and the next day
and the next week.

37:17.100 --> 37:18.167
We have no worries.

37:18.200 --> 37:19.733
Yeah. We have food security.

37:19.767 --> 37:21.933
-Yup.
-And one caribou will last
us for about a week.

37:21.967 --> 37:23.567
My oldest daughter
and my wife,

37:23.600 --> 37:26.167
they set a really good
example for the younger ones.

37:26.200 --> 37:28.067
And the younger ones
will probably follow.

37:29.433 --> 37:31.967
I just got myself
a gun for my birthday,

37:32.067 --> 37:35.900
so I was testing out my
new gun with the scope,
and I got one of them.

37:35.933 --> 37:37.400
Two, three, go...

37:38.567 --> 37:41.100
AGNES: Now that
we have food security,

37:41.133 --> 37:44.100
we can easily just
go about our business.

37:44.133 --> 37:45.700
We have wood to go get.

37:45.733 --> 37:49.800
We have some travelling to do,
and check out
the whole entire area.

37:49.833 --> 37:53.367
For now, we're set
for the next couple weeks.

37:53.400 --> 37:54.900
Yum.

37:54.933 --> 37:58.267
For us this is like
going to work
and getting the job done,

37:58.300 --> 38:00.333
and it's a job well done.

38:02.767 --> 38:04.700
ANDY: Life is good out here.

38:04.733 --> 38:09.267
It's what you make of it,
and for me, everything
is made with my hands.

38:09.300 --> 38:12.067
And that's important to me.

38:31.767 --> 38:33.100
So, a month ago

38:34.067 --> 38:36.133
I was out in the woods
cutting trees

38:38.133 --> 38:41.133
with this project in mind.

38:41.167 --> 38:45.300
The project's done,
and it turned out about
the way I'd hoped it would.

38:45.333 --> 38:48.733
This technique is not
the technique to use
if you're in a hurry.

38:48.767 --> 38:52.300
But I guarantee this building
will be here long after

38:52.333 --> 38:54.833
anything that I built
with stick framing.

38:54.867 --> 39:00.067
Probably took me
about eight days to do this,
including cutting the trees.

39:00.067 --> 39:06.800
So, you know, a little over
a week's worth of my time
to build a 16 x 16 cabin.

39:08.933 --> 39:12.400
Started really being
fascinated with

39:12.433 --> 39:14.933
timber frame when
I was about 16 years old,

39:14.967 --> 39:18.733
and I didn't even know
I would be a carpenter at
that point in time in my life,

39:18.767 --> 39:23.467
but here it is 40 years later.
I'm finally doing it. (LAUGHS)

39:29.733 --> 39:31.100
It's a great way to build.

39:31.133 --> 39:32.767
It's definitely slower.

39:32.800 --> 39:36.400
It's definitely a lot more
meticulous type of work,

39:36.433 --> 39:38.500
but it'll be around
for a long time.

39:42.800 --> 39:44.167
All right.

39:46.767 --> 39:51.333
Man, I'll be glad when
I don't have to climb
any more ladders for a while.

39:51.367 --> 39:55.200
I feel good.
It was a good
early spring project.

39:55.233 --> 39:58.500
I've got a pretty full
summer of making sawdust.

39:58.533 --> 40:03.667
Having this is gonna
make a big difference in
the bad weather days for sure.

40:03.700 --> 40:08.900
SUE: I'm the only one
that I count on in the winter
to get my chores done.

40:08.933 --> 40:13.067
You know, the only ass that
gets kicked for not completing
the job is my own.

40:25.633 --> 40:30.433
Well, I definitely
got some new snow.
Winds got pretty wild.

40:30.467 --> 40:33.300
So, I'm interested.
I'm gonna check
the generator out.

40:34.433 --> 40:37.367
See if all the proactive
stuff I did

40:37.400 --> 40:43.267
making channels, pumping,
you know, did it do
what I wanted it to do?

40:46.267 --> 40:47.767
Yeah, look at that.

40:49.967 --> 40:51.833
All my hard work has paid off.

40:51.867 --> 40:55.200
You know,
I took the opportunity

40:55.233 --> 40:58.767
before everything happened
to get ahead of the flood.

40:58.800 --> 41:01.233
Last year, 22 foot of snow,

41:01.267 --> 41:04.333
then 110 degrees,
and it was a wall of water.

41:04.367 --> 41:10.900
This year I was able
to get ahead of the game,
direct it, and it worked.

41:10.933 --> 41:12.800
So, the water was up to here.

41:12.833 --> 41:15.933
Well, you can see,
and now it's down to there.

41:15.967 --> 41:17.567
Am I gonna have more flooding?

41:17.600 --> 41:19.433
Yeah, I can't have
a white landscape,

41:19.467 --> 41:22.600
turn it to green without
some more water coming in.

41:22.633 --> 41:24.233
But getting ahead of the game,

41:24.267 --> 41:28.500
giving it a path
to get where it actually
wants to live, that's good.

41:31.233 --> 41:34.600
I'm really pleased
at having the ability

41:36.433 --> 41:39.333
to stay ahead of
the game on the flooding.

41:39.367 --> 41:42.900
So, I've got more coming,
but it's manageable.

41:42.933 --> 41:46.500
Being able to channel,
utilising the road,

41:46.533 --> 41:48.800
the slope of
the tundra itself,

41:48.833 --> 41:51.133
you know, saved the bacon
on camp this year.

41:51.167 --> 41:54.200
The river is down
from what it was,

41:54.233 --> 41:56.900
but when you freeze,
it slows everything down.

41:56.933 --> 41:59.333
You don't have that
free flow of water.

41:59.367 --> 42:01.400
There's a little bit of sun
going to be coming out.

42:01.433 --> 42:04.633
(IMITATES RUSHING WATER)
It's going to flow again.
It's going to happen.

42:04.667 --> 42:09.333
Your basic push
to the beginning
of the thaw is over.

42:09.367 --> 42:12.633
It's done.
The river is broken.
It's free flowing.

42:12.667 --> 42:16.067
The river's breaking
is a huge deal emotionally

42:16.100 --> 42:17.467
because for
all of us it's like,

42:17.500 --> 42:19.567
(GASPS) "Winter is over,
the end is in sight."

42:19.600 --> 42:22.300
I can handle
the tundra flowing.

42:22.333 --> 42:24.433
The river and how
that backs up,

42:24.467 --> 42:28.167
and how the water coming off
the tundra is impeded

42:28.200 --> 42:31.733
getting to it is what causes
you your problems.

42:31.767 --> 42:35.333
The thaw is going to be
a continual thing this year.

42:35.367 --> 42:37.300
I'll just handle it
as it comes,
'cause that's what I do.

42:37.333 --> 42:39.300
Kavik's going to be
open for business.
