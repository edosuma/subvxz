WEBVTT

00:03.753 --> 00:05.055
Can I have some of your fries?

00:05.056 --> 00:06.389
What do you have to trade?

00:06.390 --> 00:10.292
A bite of my kale Caesar salad?

00:11.061 --> 00:14.631
Kale. Caesar. Salad.

00:14.632 --> 00:17.400
Not a chance.

00:17.401 --> 00:20.337
First day back at work.

00:20.338 --> 00:22.105
Thank you for walking me, Felix.

00:22.106 --> 00:24.390
Of course, you've been
in London for three months.

00:24.391 --> 00:25.974
I didn't want you to look the wrong way

00:25.975 --> 00:27.243
before stepping off the curb

00:27.244 --> 00:29.576
and getting your pwetty wittle
head cwushed by a bus.

00:29.577 --> 00:31.371
Aww.

00:31.482 --> 00:32.991
Oscar, can I have your tomato?

00:32.992 --> 00:34.417
Sure.

00:34.418 --> 00:35.819
Oops!

00:35.820 --> 00:37.286
I missed.

00:38.355 --> 00:40.190
And that's how it's done.

00:40.191 --> 00:43.360
I didn't want to have
to do this, guys, but...

00:43.361 --> 00:44.828
Mine, mine, mine, mine, mine,

00:44.829 --> 00:47.731
mine, mine, mine,
mine, mine, mine, mine.

00:47.732 --> 00:51.835
Well, I see that nothing's changed.

00:51.836 --> 00:54.204
Must be so hard to come
back to being a waitress

00:54.205 --> 00:56.312
after spending so much time
pursuing your passion.

00:56.313 --> 00:57.874
This job is perfect for me right now.

00:57.875 --> 00:59.976
The hours are good,
and it's never busy.

00:59.977 --> 01:03.179
So I can save all of my energy
for my jewelry business.

01:03.180 --> 01:06.448
That is an excellent
rationaliza... realization.

01:09.419 --> 01:11.788
Oh, hey, Maureen, I'm back!

01:11.789 --> 01:13.188
You were gone?

01:15.658 --> 01:17.494
Ah, Oscar Madison!

01:17.495 --> 01:19.028
My favorite customer!

01:19.029 --> 01:21.063
You fry it, he'll eat it.

01:22.165 --> 01:23.600
Well, it's your fault, Freddie.

01:23.601 --> 01:25.468
You've got the best
French fries in the city.

01:25.469 --> 01:28.671
The secret is we haven't
changed the oil in 30 years.

01:28.672 --> 01:30.440
(laughter)

01:30.441 --> 01:32.708
I love that you think I'm kidding.

01:34.144 --> 01:35.712
Anyway, enjoy 'em while you can.

01:35.713 --> 01:37.680
I'm thinking of closing this place.

01:37.681 --> 01:38.982
Why are you thinking that?

01:38.983 --> 01:40.316
Don't think that!

01:40.317 --> 01:42.919
That's not a thought to have!

01:42.920 --> 01:44.487
Well, the broiler's on the fritz,

01:44.488 --> 01:46.122
the freezer's on its last legs.

01:46.123 --> 01:48.226
I got to decide whether
it's worth sinking more money

01:48.227 --> 01:51.327
into this place
or just calling it a day.

01:51.328 --> 01:52.762
Well, you can't close Langford's!

01:52.763 --> 01:54.230
It's my home away from home!

01:54.231 --> 01:56.399
This is my lucky pick-up table,

01:56.400 --> 01:59.102
there's my make-out corner,

01:59.103 --> 02:01.537
and everyone knows my dumping table.

02:02.906 --> 02:05.708
And I've had so many first dates here.

02:05.709 --> 02:07.943
So many.

02:09.378 --> 02:12.449
I celebrated my tenth
wedding anniversary here.

02:12.450 --> 02:14.783
Man, my wife was mad when I got home.

02:16.753 --> 02:18.455
Well, of course if any of you clowns

02:18.456 --> 02:21.925
has 20 grand lying
around for upgrades...

02:21.926 --> 02:23.560
Ah, I'm kidding.

02:23.561 --> 02:25.460
If you did, you wouldn't
be eating here.

02:26.963 --> 02:29.631
♪

02:31.968 --> 02:33.436
(humming)

02:33.437 --> 02:35.638
Oscar, why are you in a suit?

02:35.639 --> 02:37.607
I wanted to raise some
money to save Langford's,

02:37.608 --> 02:40.109
so I went down to the bank
and asked for a loan.

02:40.110 --> 02:42.912
(howling laugh)

02:42.913 --> 02:44.180
That's what they said.

02:44.181 --> 02:46.049
So I guess that's it.

02:46.050 --> 02:49.719
My favorite hangout spot,
Langford's, will be no more.

02:49.720 --> 02:51.753
May she rest in grease.

02:52.722 --> 02:54.090
I'm sorry, Oscar.

02:54.091 --> 02:56.226
I know how much
that place means to you.

02:56.227 --> 02:58.928
I just wish I knew
someone with the money

02:58.929 --> 03:03.199
to put into a rock-solid investment.

03:03.200 --> 03:04.567
A hero who's willing to swoop in

03:04.568 --> 03:06.069
and save the day.

03:06.070 --> 03:07.637
And not just for me.

03:07.638 --> 03:10.206
Think of your dear
sweetheart girlfriend, Emily.

03:10.207 --> 03:11.841
She'll be out of a job.

03:11.842 --> 03:14.522
I mean sure she's got that
red hot jewelry business

03:14.523 --> 03:15.560
to fall back on.

03:16.779 --> 03:18.014
Are you finished?

03:18.015 --> 03:20.416
Can I be?

03:20.417 --> 03:22.760
Okay, so when I first heard
about the Langford's situation,

03:22.761 --> 03:24.821
I must admit, I was a tad intrigued.

03:24.822 --> 03:26.322
Can I tell you a secret?

03:26.323 --> 03:27.857
Safe space.

03:27.858 --> 03:29.292
I have always thought about

03:29.293 --> 03:31.828
dipping my toe in the restaurant "biz."

03:31.829 --> 03:34.163
Ever since the third grade,
when I served my classmates

03:34.164 --> 03:37.166
a perfectly fired white
chocolate crème brulée.

03:37.167 --> 03:38.600
Was it a hit?

03:39.369 --> 03:40.837
Let's just say,

03:40.838 --> 03:44.307
there were no atomic
wedgies for Felix that day.

03:44.308 --> 03:46.509
So investing in a restaurant

03:46.510 --> 03:48.811
would kind of be like
your dream come true.

03:48.812 --> 03:51.418
Well, I was thinking about
something more upscale,

03:51.419 --> 03:52.652
but it could be a start, yes.

03:52.653 --> 03:53.483
It could be.

03:53.484 --> 03:55.451
Felix Unger, restaurateur!

03:55.452 --> 03:56.686
I like the sound of that!

03:56.687 --> 03:57.787
You can't not do it!

03:57.788 --> 03:59.889
I cannot not!

03:59.890 --> 04:01.524
You know what I'm going to do?

04:01.525 --> 04:03.533
I'm going to call the
bank and laugh at them.

04:04.027 --> 04:05.861
This is going to be great.

04:08.164 --> 04:10.832
English.

04:13.469 --> 04:14.870
Representative.

04:18.374 --> 04:20.877
I have to say, when
you agreed to kick in

04:20.878 --> 04:22.211
to upgrade the kitchen,

04:22.212 --> 04:24.312
I didn't expect this.

04:27.684 --> 04:28.885
Well,

04:28.886 --> 04:30.920
when you get into
business with Felix Unger,

04:30.921 --> 04:32.688
you get Felix Unger in your business.

04:34.324 --> 04:37.356
So, the table bottoms
have been de-gummed,

04:37.357 --> 04:39.291
the ketchup bottles
have been de-crusted,

04:39.292 --> 04:41.360
and now I'm off to
repaint the men's room,

04:41.361 --> 04:45.598
which has become a veritable
museum of graffiti penises.

04:45.599 --> 04:47.700
Well, thanks, Felix.

04:47.701 --> 04:50.069
I feel like a weight's been
lifted off my shoulder.

04:50.070 --> 04:52.004
As a matter of fact,
I'm taking the weekend off,

04:52.005 --> 04:53.365
I'm going to visit my daughter.

04:53.366 --> 04:54.640
How nice.

04:54.641 --> 04:57.476
Yeah, she went to an
all-you-can-eat sushi buffet

04:57.477 --> 05:00.712
and her lap band finally gave.

05:02.481 --> 05:04.349
Eel everywhere.

05:08.621 --> 05:10.689
While I have you,

05:10.690 --> 05:13.158
would you mind if I correct
a few spelling errors

05:13.159 --> 05:14.994
on the menu?

05:14.995 --> 05:17.730
I'm assuming you didn't mean
to say "jalapeño poopers."

05:17.731 --> 05:20.232
Clearly, you've never tried them.

05:20.233 --> 05:22.201
But, sure, correct away.

05:22.202 --> 05:24.297
And would you mind
if I tweaked the menu

05:24.298 --> 05:25.604
a little bit for tonight?

05:25.605 --> 05:27.926
You see, I've invited some of
my foodie friends for dinner,

05:27.927 --> 05:29.790
and I'd like the specials
to be really special.

05:29.791 --> 05:31.237
Whatever you want, Felix.

05:35.748 --> 05:38.149
Whatever I want.

05:38.851 --> 05:40.552
You know what?

05:40.553 --> 05:42.221
Before you repaint the bathroom,

05:42.222 --> 05:44.522
there's a phone number
I want to write down.

05:50.262 --> 05:54.600
A hearty bison stew
with rosemary dumplings

05:54.601 --> 05:56.335
and a dollop of crème fraiche.

05:56.336 --> 06:01.073
Lady and gentlemen,
I give you pub food, elevated.

06:01.074 --> 06:03.442
<i>Bon appétit!</i>

06:03.443 --> 06:05.244
Who are those nerds?

06:05.245 --> 06:09.348
They're just Felix's
annoying foodie friends.

06:09.349 --> 06:11.212
They keep saying stuff
like "organically grown"

06:11.213 --> 06:12.685
and "farm-to-table."

06:12.686 --> 06:15.387
I'd like to serve them
some fist-to-face.

06:15.388 --> 06:18.290
They seem intrigued,
but we cannot become complacent.

06:18.291 --> 06:19.796
Emily, keep their wine glasses full.

06:19.797 --> 06:22.448
Maureen, remember, you're
never fully dressed without a...

06:22.449 --> 06:23.594
Bra?

06:25.998 --> 06:28.132
No... well, yes, let's
remember that for tomorrow.

06:28.968 --> 06:29.868
Emily?

06:29.869 --> 06:31.036
A smile.

06:31.037 --> 06:32.438
Exactly.

06:32.439 --> 06:34.939
So might we see one of those
from you tonight, Maureen?

06:38.310 --> 06:40.779
Usually the corners
go up just a bit more

06:40.780 --> 06:42.480
in a traditional human smile.

06:43.749 --> 06:44.916
(gasps) Felix, look!

06:46.018 --> 06:47.553
They're taking pictures of their food!

06:47.554 --> 06:49.821
They're taking pictures of their food.

06:51.217 --> 06:53.258
I didn't take that many
photos when I went to China.

06:53.259 --> 06:55.961
And I saw a panda riding a Big Wheel.

06:55.962 --> 06:57.229
All right, lay off.

06:57.230 --> 06:58.938
Felix is having fun.

06:58.939 --> 07:01.903
And that's a small price to pay
for him keeping Langford's open.

07:02.868 --> 07:04.570
Now if you'll excuse me,

07:04.571 --> 07:09.607
I've got a freshly painted
bathroom stall... to weiner.

07:12.344 --> 07:14.279
I gotta hand it to you, Felix.

07:14.280 --> 07:19.518
Last night you were a real groin pull,

07:19.519 --> 07:21.387
but tonight this place is jumping.

07:21.388 --> 07:22.788
Exciting, isn't it?

07:22.789 --> 07:24.757
And now would you show
this lovely couple

07:24.758 --> 07:26.025
to table number seven, please?

07:26.026 --> 07:27.458
Right this way.

07:31.330 --> 07:34.666
Whoa, whoo, this place is packed.

07:34.667 --> 07:37.335
Did somebody see the face
of Jesus on a quesadilla?

07:39.271 --> 07:41.974
My friend Balthazar
tweeted a glowing review

07:41.975 --> 07:44.510
of his epicurean experience,
and it reverberated

07:44.511 --> 07:47.513
through the gastronomic
blog-o-sphere like wildfire!

07:47.514 --> 07:50.215
Can you believe it?

07:50.216 --> 07:51.550
Believe it?

07:51.551 --> 07:54.286
I don't even understand it.

07:54.287 --> 07:56.055
I'm living my dream, Oscar.

07:56.056 --> 07:57.989
I'm living my dream!

07:59.000 --> 08:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:06.198 --> 08:07.665
You're not us.

08:09.735 --> 08:10.903
It's okay, Oscar.

08:10.904 --> 08:12.237
We can sit at the bar.

08:12.238 --> 08:13.505
But my booth...

08:13.506 --> 08:15.140
My booth...

08:15.141 --> 08:16.708
Can we get three drafts?

08:16.709 --> 08:18.677
Actually, Mr. Unger
replaced our regular keg

08:18.678 --> 08:20.479
with an artisanal hard cider.

08:20.480 --> 08:21.713
Cider?

08:21.714 --> 08:24.215
What are we on, a freaking hay ride?

08:25.484 --> 08:26.685
And where's the hockey game?

08:26.686 --> 08:28.420
Why are all the TVs off?

08:28.421 --> 08:31.156
Oh, Felix thinks they're a distraction.

08:31.157 --> 08:33.424
He wants the customers
to talk to each other.

08:33.426 --> 08:37.496
Ugh... I don't want to talk to you.

08:37.496 --> 08:39.898
Why would he? That's crazy!

08:39.899 --> 08:40.866
<i>You're</i> complaining?

08:40.866 --> 08:42.400
Felix has been running me ragged.

08:42.402 --> 08:44.102
I haven't had a break in four hours.

08:44.104 --> 08:47.238
Unless you count weeping
out by the dumpster.

08:48.340 --> 08:50.841
French fries, you'll never let me down.

08:53.512 --> 08:55.581
No, no, no!

08:55.582 --> 08:57.516
Felix, Felix!

08:57.517 --> 08:59.084
What did you do to the fries?!

08:59.085 --> 09:00.252
Aren't they divine?

09:00.253 --> 09:02.354
I finally changed the oil in the fryer.

09:02.355 --> 09:05.624
You changed the beer,
then you changed the fries,

09:05.625 --> 09:07.860
and I don't know what
it smells like in here,

09:07.861 --> 09:10.061
but it certainly isn't urine!

09:11.563 --> 09:13.565
You've ruined Langford's!

09:13.566 --> 09:15.267
Ruined it?

09:15.268 --> 09:18.036
I've saved it from ruin,
exactly as you asked me to.

09:18.037 --> 09:21.974
I asked you to write a check,
not Felix it all up!

09:21.975 --> 09:24.408
He's got Maureen wearing a bra.

09:26.712 --> 09:28.480
Monster!

09:28.481 --> 09:32.818
Well, I do not have time
for your ingratitude.

09:32.819 --> 09:34.620
As you can see,
I have customers waiting.

09:34.621 --> 09:36.421
Fine, they can have our seats.

09:36.422 --> 09:38.257
Dani, Teddy, come on.

09:38.258 --> 09:40.759
And anybody who wants to
watch the game at my place,

09:40.760 --> 09:42.827
follow me!

09:43.795 --> 09:45.831
Fine! Go!

09:45.832 --> 09:47.513
And don't think I don't
know you're the one

09:47.514 --> 09:49.297
that graffiti-ed my
freshly painted restroom!

09:49.298 --> 09:51.250
I would recognize your weiner anywhere!

09:54.072 --> 09:56.407
<i>Bon appétit.</i>

10:04.847 --> 10:06.214
(cheering)

10:06.215 --> 10:07.749
My man Carmelo!

10:07.750 --> 10:10.884
Mmm, I would climb him like a redwood.

10:11.786 --> 10:13.054
What'd we miss?

10:13.055 --> 10:14.322
Knicks are back up.

10:14.323 --> 10:17.025
And Dani needs a boyfriend.

10:17.026 --> 10:18.727
(knock at door)

10:18.728 --> 10:20.028
This where the game's on?

10:20.029 --> 10:23.764
Dirty t-shirt, big beer belly
guy... welcome home.

10:25.100 --> 10:27.084
(quietly): We're really
bringing in quite a crowd.

10:27.085 --> 10:29.571
I put a post on Facebook
telling real Langford's regulars

10:29.572 --> 10:31.106
to come up here.

10:31.107 --> 10:32.173
Oh, that's a great idea.

10:32.174 --> 10:34.476
I actually do have a
background in marketing.

10:34.477 --> 10:37.344
Wayne, I don't need
your life story, man.

10:39.114 --> 10:40.382
This is all we need, right?

10:40.383 --> 10:42.450
We have beer, chips, sports on TV,

10:42.451 --> 10:44.119
just like Langford's.

10:44.120 --> 10:46.087
(sighing): Yeah, I guess so.

10:46.088 --> 10:48.990
Just I have so many memories there.

10:48.991 --> 10:53.294
That's where I met my wife,
signed my first contract,

10:53.295 --> 10:55.729
drowned my sorrows after my divorce.

10:57.232 --> 10:59.968
Wow, there are a lot of people here.

10:59.969 --> 11:01.736
Yeah, you off for the night?

11:01.737 --> 11:03.538
Yeah, I was going
to work on my website,

11:03.539 --> 11:05.640
but thanks to Felix, I'm too tired.

11:05.641 --> 11:06.975
I have to keep reminding myself

11:06.976 --> 11:09.778
I am a jewelry designer,
not a waitress.

11:09.779 --> 11:11.112
Mm-hmm.

11:11.113 --> 11:12.816
Hey, Emily, if you're
going to the kitchen,

11:12.817 --> 11:13.648
I could use a beer.

11:13.649 --> 11:14.783
Yep.

11:14.784 --> 11:16.251
We could use a refill on the chips.

11:16.252 --> 11:17.652
Oh, okay.

11:17.653 --> 11:19.054
Yeah, I'll have a scotch and soda.

11:19.055 --> 11:20.288
Vodka rocks?

11:20.289 --> 11:22.956
Hang on, let me write this down.

11:28.963 --> 11:30.465
Hey...

11:30.466 --> 11:31.766
Welcome.

11:31.767 --> 11:33.568
Beer's in the fridge,
crapper's down the hall.

11:33.569 --> 11:35.852
Don't forget to sign up
for the basketball tournament.

11:35.853 --> 11:37.009
What basketball tournament?

11:37.010 --> 11:38.576
Ow!

11:41.973 --> 11:43.182
NORMAN: Keg party!

11:43.183 --> 11:44.247
This is going to be great.

11:44.248 --> 11:46.275
Yeah, and when it's empty,
we can roll it

11:46.276 --> 11:49.545
down the staircase
and play Donkey Kong.

11:49.546 --> 11:51.647
Oscar, who are all these people?

11:51.648 --> 11:53.048
These are Langford's regulars

11:53.049 --> 11:54.717
who hate what you've
done with the place.

11:54.718 --> 11:56.919
Yeah, Mr. Madison filled me in.

11:56.920 --> 11:59.922
Uncool, Unger, uncool.

11:59.923 --> 12:02.026
Norman, as a building employee
you should have denied

12:02.027 --> 12:03.992
this riff-raff access to the premises.

12:03.993 --> 12:04.993
It's my day off.

12:04.994 --> 12:06.137
Then why are you in uniform?

12:06.138 --> 12:08.005
Chicks dig it.

12:09.965 --> 12:11.200
Oscar, I am exhausted,

12:11.201 --> 12:12.735
and you don't even know
half of these people!

12:12.736 --> 12:13.902
What are you talking about?

12:13.903 --> 12:14.903
These are my friends.

12:14.904 --> 12:15.938
Teddy...

12:15.939 --> 12:18.640
Blue hat guy...

12:18.641 --> 12:21.309
Sally Big Boobs...

12:21.844 --> 12:25.280
And Asian Mr. T.

12:25.281 --> 12:27.316
Oscar, you're acting childish.

12:27.317 --> 12:29.752
Ow!

12:29.753 --> 12:31.353
Okay, you were in trouble

12:31.354 --> 12:33.489
and I stepped in and helped you,
like I always do.

12:33.490 --> 12:34.857
But do I get any gratitude?

12:34.858 --> 12:35.858
For what?

12:35.859 --> 12:37.459
Every time I find something I like,

12:37.460 --> 12:39.962
you swoop in and
improve the fun out of it.

12:39.963 --> 12:41.597
First you moved in,

12:41.598 --> 12:43.365
then you banned cigar smoke,

12:43.366 --> 12:46.135
and spitting, and kitchen nudity.

12:46.136 --> 12:48.137
You were using a panini press.

12:48.138 --> 12:50.806
It was for your own safety.

12:50.807 --> 12:53.175
And now you're doing it
with Langford's.

12:53.176 --> 12:54.743
You took my home away,

12:54.744 --> 12:56.979
now you're taking my
home away from home...

12:56.980 --> 12:58.379
...away.

12:59.681 --> 13:01.016
This is ridiculous.

13:01.017 --> 13:02.785
Oscar, I want these people out of here!

13:02.786 --> 13:04.686
No, they're staying.

13:04.687 --> 13:06.722
In fact, we're doing this
again tomorrow night.

13:06.723 --> 13:08.357
And every night after that!

13:08.358 --> 13:10.793
(cheers and applause)

13:10.794 --> 13:12.995
We could call it Langford's North.

13:12.996 --> 13:14.696
Langford's North, I like it!

13:14.697 --> 13:16.365
Well, branding was
sort of my specialty.

13:16.366 --> 13:17.999
Wayne, seriously, stop it.

13:19.568 --> 13:21.303
I do not have time for this tomfoolery.

13:21.304 --> 13:23.170
I'm going to bed!

13:24.039 --> 13:26.275
It's mine now, now I keep it.

13:26.276 --> 13:28.342
Okay, okay, take 'em all.

13:38.469 --> 13:39.943
Morning, Dani.

13:39.944 --> 13:42.545
I would help you clean up, but
I'm refusing based on principle.

13:44.748 --> 13:48.318
There's a tortilla chip by
the table right there if you...

13:48.319 --> 13:49.753
Wanted to make sure you saw it.

13:49.754 --> 13:50.587
Yeah, I see it.

13:50.588 --> 13:51.587
I see it.

13:53.690 --> 13:56.026
Felix, can't you and Oscar settle this?

13:56.027 --> 13:57.995
It's been four days.

13:57.996 --> 13:59.630
Look what it's doing
to your friendship.

13:59.631 --> 14:00.998
I didn't mean to upset him.

14:00.999 --> 14:02.699
He's my best friend.

14:02.700 --> 14:05.335
You know, one of you is going
to have to be the bigger person.

14:05.336 --> 14:07.938
And I think we both know
who the bigger person is.

14:07.939 --> 14:09.545
I suppose we could find
some compromise.

14:09.546 --> 14:15.382
I could turn the TVs back on,
or serve a... domestic beer.

14:16.918 --> 14:18.820
FELIX: Oscar,

14:18.821 --> 14:19.924
could we talk for a moment?

14:19.925 --> 14:22.390
Not now. I gotta unload my supplies.

14:22.391 --> 14:24.826
Corn chips, naked lady swizzle sticks,

14:24.827 --> 14:27.929
all we need for a wild
night at Langford's North,

14:27.930 --> 14:30.330
a division of OscarCorp.

14:31.532 --> 14:33.519
Well, I've been thinking
about some of the changes

14:33.520 --> 14:34.821
that I made down at Langford's.

14:34.822 --> 14:36.589
Yes, I've been thinking, too.

14:36.590 --> 14:39.325
And we would like to use your
bathroom as the men's room.

14:39.326 --> 14:42.627
Mind if I install a urine trough?

14:43.429 --> 14:45.131
You wouldn't dare!

14:45.132 --> 14:47.400
I don't have much of a choice, do I?

14:47.401 --> 14:48.901
Well, then neither do I!

14:48.902 --> 14:50.252
And now if you'll excuse me,

14:50.253 --> 14:52.919
I have discerning palates to sate!

14:57.606 --> 15:00.928
I hate it when he talks like a book.

15:00.929 --> 15:02.529
I know.

15:02.530 --> 15:04.231
But think about it from his side.

15:04.232 --> 15:05.935
I mean, he's getting
to live out a fantasy.

15:05.936 --> 15:07.735
And remember, he did this to help you.

15:07.736 --> 15:09.169
I know.

15:09.170 --> 15:10.904
It's not like I enjoy having people

15:10.905 --> 15:12.773
trash my apartment every night.

15:12.774 --> 15:15.876
That's supposed to be my job.

15:15.877 --> 15:19.246
Well, one of you is gonna have
to be the bigger person,

15:19.247 --> 15:22.648
and I think we both know
who the bigger person is.

15:26.287 --> 15:27.655
It's me, right?

15:27.656 --> 15:30.490
Of course it is.

15:31.725 --> 15:33.494
Hey, Felix, can you talk for a second?

15:33.495 --> 15:35.462
Sorry, no, I've got to get these
supplies down to Langford's.

15:35.463 --> 15:37.631
Elderberries for our
new signature cocktail.

15:37.632 --> 15:39.732
A Terence Trent D'Arby
CD for atmosphere.

15:42.603 --> 15:44.470
And truffle oil.

15:45.506 --> 15:47.608
For the fries.

15:47.609 --> 15:49.342
Monster!

15:59.520 --> 16:01.188
Oh, Emily!

16:01.189 --> 16:02.856
Problem.

16:02.857 --> 16:04.991
The swan is our weekend napkin.

16:07.161 --> 16:08.595
Weekdays are rabbits.

16:08.596 --> 16:12.365
Does somebody need another
copy of the napkin calendar?

16:13.500 --> 16:15.469
Felix, we have to talk,

16:15.470 --> 16:16.603
okay?

16:16.604 --> 16:17.605
For the past four days...

16:17.606 --> 16:18.589
FREDDIE: Is that Unger?!

16:18.590 --> 16:19.340
Grab him!

16:19.341 --> 16:20.673
Don't let him leave!

16:21.542 --> 16:22.975
Got him, Chief!

16:24.945 --> 16:26.647
What did you do?!

16:26.648 --> 16:27.815
What do you mean?

16:27.816 --> 16:28.782
Maureen, let go!

16:28.783 --> 16:30.851
You've got gorilla strength.

16:30.852 --> 16:32.186
I was gone three days.

16:32.187 --> 16:34.782
The restaurant lost $3,200!

16:34.783 --> 16:36.726
What are you talking about?
The place was packed!

16:36.727 --> 16:39.626
You spent too much
on your fancy ingredients.

16:39.627 --> 16:40.961
Bison?

16:40.962 --> 16:42.363
Truffles?

16:42.364 --> 16:45.866
I lost money on everything
that came out of that kitchen.

16:45.867 --> 16:47.530
The crowd that I was
trying to cater to...

16:47.531 --> 16:48.569
That's another thing!

16:48.570 --> 16:50.703
Your crowd doesn't drink enough.

16:52.206 --> 16:53.807
They're too pleased with their lives.

16:53.808 --> 16:57.176
I want sad bastards
with drinking problems!

16:59.113 --> 17:01.949
I'm so sorry, Felix.

17:01.950 --> 17:04.752
It's such a bummer to have
to go back to paper napkins

17:04.752 --> 17:06.920
and me having time and energy

17:06.921 --> 17:09.155
to pursue my passions and whatnot.

17:10.391 --> 17:11.824
Darn it!

17:14.895 --> 17:17.039
I'm sure that we could find
some sort of compromise...

17:17.040 --> 17:17.931
Buhp-buhp!

17:17.932 --> 17:20.901
From now on, you are a silent investor.

17:20.902 --> 17:22.069
Do you understand?

17:22.069 --> 17:23.537
I just wanted to...

17:23.538 --> 17:24.905
Buhp!

17:24.906 --> 17:27.241
Silent!

17:27.242 --> 17:30.510
First my daughter
explodes and now this.

17:32.179 --> 17:34.614
(knocking)

17:35.916 --> 17:37.351
Norman, you're here early.

17:37.352 --> 17:38.952
Yeah, actually, I've got some bad news.

17:38.953 --> 17:40.854
Mr. and Mrs. Kim downstairs

17:40.855 --> 17:43.056
complained about the
crowds and the noise

17:43.057 --> 17:47.294
and someone dropping a potted
plant onto their balcony.

17:47.295 --> 17:48.562
That was you.

17:48.563 --> 17:50.197
You did that.

17:50.198 --> 17:54.435
You, me, either way,
I gotta shut you down.

17:54.436 --> 17:56.936
I'm afraid it's the end
of Langford's North.

17:58.505 --> 18:00.106
I'm sorry, Oscar.

18:02.443 --> 18:05.044
Mr. Rogers.

18:09.917 --> 18:12.418
Captain Kangaroo.

18:18.125 --> 18:21.128
Felix, you will be happy
to know that Oscar...

18:21.129 --> 18:23.764
Dani, Dani, Dani, Dani!

18:23.765 --> 18:25.866
You will be happy to
know that I have decided

18:25.867 --> 18:28.402
to close down Langford's
North for good.

18:28.403 --> 18:30.002
For you!

18:30.904 --> 18:32.105
I mean,

18:32.106 --> 18:33.340
you live here too,

18:33.341 --> 18:35.375
and you can't be unhappy
where you live.

18:35.376 --> 18:38.645
So, you're welcome.

18:38.646 --> 18:40.981
That is such a coincidence
because we were...

18:40.982 --> 18:42.415
Because...

18:45.018 --> 18:46.288
I was just coming to tell you

18:46.289 --> 18:48.256
that I am stepping away
from Langford's.

18:48.257 --> 18:50.224
Was I a stunning success?

18:50.225 --> 18:51.526
Yes.

18:51.527 --> 18:54.262
Does it matter if it makes you unhappy?

18:54.263 --> 18:55.563
No, not a whit.

18:55.564 --> 18:58.466
Well, that is a great reaction

18:58.467 --> 19:02.670
to the grand gesture
that I made... first.

19:02.671 --> 19:04.105
Not that it's important,

19:04.106 --> 19:06.240
but that is the order in which it went.

19:06.241 --> 19:08.743
Why are we even arguing?

19:08.744 --> 19:10.411
We'll never know who went first,

19:10.412 --> 19:12.195
or who thought of their
thing in the elevator

19:12.196 --> 19:14.986
before they even came in here
and you said your thing, so...

19:15.450 --> 19:18.252
Yeah, I mean, who cares
who thought of it first?

19:18.253 --> 19:21.788
The important thing is that it was me.

19:22.924 --> 19:25.126
How do you work for him?

19:25.127 --> 19:27.227
How do you sleep with him?

19:28.830 --> 19:29.764
I'm sorry, Oscar.

19:29.765 --> 19:31.065
You know I get carried away.

19:31.066 --> 19:32.266
Yeah, I'm sorry, too.

19:32.267 --> 19:33.850
I didn't mean to call you a fun-killer.

19:33.851 --> 19:35.670
You were just trying to help me out.

19:35.671 --> 19:36.804
(knocking)

19:36.805 --> 19:38.672
Let's get our drink on!

19:40.908 --> 19:44.245
Sorry, guys, Langford's
North is closed for good.

19:44.246 --> 19:45.913
(groaning)

19:45.914 --> 19:47.148
Wait, Oscar.

19:47.149 --> 19:48.916
Why don't you do it one last time?

19:48.917 --> 19:49.750
Really?

19:49.751 --> 19:51.118
Why not?

19:51.119 --> 19:52.353
(cheering)

19:52.354 --> 19:53.488
I'll order pizza!

19:53.489 --> 19:56.691
No, no, no, no, no,
pizza is so pedestrian.

19:56.692 --> 19:58.993
I know a hot new Ethiopian place

19:58.994 --> 20:01.494
that does a marvelous yesiga fit-fit.

20:03.531 --> 20:04.864
Pizza it is.

20:13.899 --> 20:15.634
So, Felix, we're good?

20:15.635 --> 20:17.035
No hard feelings?

20:17.036 --> 20:18.036
Of course.

20:18.037 --> 20:19.304
Actually, it was exhausting

20:19.305 --> 20:21.473
maintaining such a high
standard of excellence.

20:21.474 --> 20:23.874
Well, those days are long gone.

20:24.843 --> 20:26.344
Here they are...

20:26.345 --> 20:28.546
the first batch out of the fryer.

20:28.547 --> 20:30.181
(crunching)

20:30.182 --> 20:32.851
Nice, greasy texture.

20:32.852 --> 20:35.352
I'm getting notes of smoke...

20:36.621 --> 20:38.355
...and a hint of potato.

20:40.992 --> 20:42.394
Yep, the fries are back!

20:42.395 --> 20:44.029
(cheering)

20:44.030 --> 20:45.997
Fred, how do you do it?

20:45.998 --> 20:47.132
I got lucky.

20:47.133 --> 20:48.533
I found the old oil

20:48.534 --> 20:51.135
in a 50-gallon drum back in the alley.

20:52.871 --> 20:54.339
I didn't leave it there.

20:54.340 --> 20:56.176
I took it straight to
the recycling center.

20:56.177 --> 20:59.644
Hm.

20:59.645 --> 21:02.647
So where did this oil come from?

21:02.648 --> 21:03.948
Who gives a crap?

21:03.949 --> 21:05.182
It's delicious!

21:08.648 --> 21:16.248
