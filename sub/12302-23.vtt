WEBVTT

01:42.129 --> 01:43.225
How long was that ?

01:44.208 --> 01:45.591
Three minutes and 20.
We're ahead.

01:45.637 --> 01:47.164
Okay, get him up on the gurney.

02:08.286 --> 02:09.874
Easy ! Not so tight.

02:16.537 --> 02:17.416
That's good.

02:18.040 --> 02:19.788
An hour from now,
we'll do it the same way.

02:25.232 --> 02:26.924
I got your message, Don.

02:27.916 --> 02:28.540
What's up ?

02:29.003 --> 02:31.733
Ax-man got a stay of execution.

02:36.110 --> 02:38.189
Ken Kramer ?
On what grounds ?

02:38.190 --> 02:40.669
Word's out Ms. Valera's work
is under review.

02:40.670 --> 02:42.868
She was the DNA analyst for the case.

02:42.868 --> 02:44.557
I thought we were
going back six months.

02:44.561 --> 02:46.782
Mr. Kramer was convicted
five years ago.

02:46.782 --> 02:49.443
Florida Supreme Court doesn't
want to take any chances.

02:49.445 --> 02:51.373
Tell that to the people
he slaughtered.

02:51.505 --> 02:52.904
Look, I'm on your side,

02:53.133 --> 02:54.720
but this is a death sentence.

02:54.723 --> 02:57.653
Yes, you open this case,
it could be ours.

03:50.172 --> 03:50.851
Yes, Paula ?

03:50.946 --> 03:52.184
Lieutenant Caine, sir ?

03:52.971 --> 03:54.584
She's been waiting to see you.

03:55.704 --> 03:56.828
'Kay. Thank you.

03:57.031 --> 03:57.454
Ma'am ?

03:57.539 --> 03:58.270
Hi.

03:58.727 --> 04:00.565
I'm Miranda Lewis.

04:01.372 --> 04:02.923
Mike Lewis was my son.

04:03.083 --> 04:06.115
I'm sorry for your loss.
I assume that you're here because

04:06.509 --> 04:07.644
you've heard about the stay.

04:07.734 --> 04:08.919
Ken Kramer killed him.

04:09.076 --> 04:10.284
Yes. Well, ma'am, we're doing

04:10.285 --> 04:12.401
everything we can
to resolve the issues.

04:12.450 --> 04:13.913
They found the ax.

04:13.989 --> 04:17.031
He confessed ;
there is no reason for this.

04:17.163 --> 04:18.863
- I understand.
- No...

04:18.987 --> 04:20.083
you don't.

04:21.813 --> 04:24.544
Mike shouldn't have to pay
for your lab's mistakes.

04:24.554 --> 04:26.151
Well, ma'am, that's merely an avenue

04:26.241 --> 04:28.249
for the attorneys to
get a temporary stay.

04:30.569 --> 04:32.601
I-I don't know if can
go through this again.

04:33.628 --> 04:37.551
We are doing everything we can
so you don't have to, okay ?

04:42.004 --> 04:43.687
I want to believe you.

04:48.075 --> 04:49.445
Are you on the death row case ?

04:49.516 --> 04:50.638
Yeah, the whole lab is.

04:50.674 --> 04:51.666
Let me ask you something.

04:51.843 --> 04:53.366
If the ax-man's attorneys are saying

04:53.454 --> 04:56.130
our DNA lab screwed up,
what's it help to have us

04:56.229 --> 04:57.738
reanalyze the biologicals ?

04:57.846 --> 05:01.091
We're not. His attorney's
using an outside lab.

05:01.856 --> 05:04.160
But the whole case was DNA.
What are we supposed to work on ?

05:04.279 --> 05:05.580
Any and all non-biologicals.

05:05.581 --> 05:06.970
That way if the DNA gets thrown out,

05:07.064 --> 05:08.101
we have backup evidence.

05:08.435 --> 05:10.714
Who was the primary on
this case five years ago ?

05:11.049 --> 05:12.407
Speedle was.

05:12.932 --> 05:15.235
Kramer attacked an
innocent couple with an ax.

05:20.694 --> 05:22.192
Guy couldn't be more guilty.

05:22.274 --> 05:23.914
I was just asking, Delko.

05:24.228 --> 05:25.151
Just telling.

05:25.206 --> 05:26.872
All right, you guys,
we've got a deadline.

05:27.350 --> 05:27.857
Yeah.

05:28.487 --> 05:30.765
I'll be in the layout room
learning the case.

05:31.548 --> 05:33.755
The ax-man was
Detective Swanson's case.

05:33.889 --> 05:35.030
He retired last year.

05:35.173 --> 05:36.334
Happened at a beach house.

05:40.615 --> 05:43.063
Yes, I remember it :
Sheri Vanover and...

05:43.956 --> 05:45.268
Mike Lewis.

05:45.393 --> 05:47.349
I met his mother this morning.

05:47.489 --> 05:49.643
Don't know how ax-man got in,
but he duct-taped them both,

05:49.734 --> 05:50.541
raped the girl,

05:51.005 --> 05:51.882
then he killed them.

05:54.408 --> 05:55.306
No !

05:57.984 --> 06:00.785
Swanson says that he believes
there's no apparent connection

06:00.886 --> 06:04.379
between the killer and his victims,
that it's a random crime ?

06:04.804 --> 06:05.768
Brutal, too.

06:06.128 --> 06:08.524
Sheri Vanover--
we found her in the main room ;

06:09.023 --> 06:10.322
what was left of her.

06:17.162 --> 06:18.729
Where's the boyfriend, Frank ?

06:18.839 --> 06:20.855
Mike Lewis--
we found him in a hallway.

06:24.124 --> 06:25.548
So they were separated.

06:25.662 --> 06:26.693
Looks that way.

06:27.964 --> 06:30.985
There's not much blood on him,
Frank, except for his legs.

06:31.079 --> 06:31.996
He was strangled.

06:33.070 --> 06:37.314
Frank, why, if you had an ax,
would you strangle someone ?

06:37.972 --> 06:39.883
I don't know.
Maybe an afterthought ?

06:40.130 --> 06:41.811
All I know is, the girl was raped,

06:41.813 --> 06:45.512
hacked 17 times with an ax, so
she was obviously Kramer's focus.

06:45.755 --> 06:46.700
Maybe not.

06:57.763 --> 06:58.785
That's weird.

07:00.385 --> 07:01.818
Anything on Mike Lewis ?

07:02.453 --> 07:03.810
Yeah. How'd you know ?

07:04.560 --> 07:07.659
The blood pool attributed
to Sheri Vanover.

07:08.193 --> 07:10.846
There were drag marks through it ;
only she died in place.

07:10.941 --> 07:12.955
So someone else was dragged through it.

07:13.197 --> 07:15.567
Speedle noted that in
the original investigation.

07:15.950 --> 07:17.386
Had to be Mike Lewis.

07:17.967 --> 07:20.166
The way the blood smeared,
the drag marks

07:20.167 --> 07:21.761
are messy and erratic.

07:21.869 --> 07:23.517
It means there was a struggle.

07:30.139 --> 07:31.482
- It means he was still alive, right ?
- Yeah.

07:31.576 --> 07:33.998
But it means he was killed second, too.

07:34.338 --> 07:36.283
Doesn't make sense. He was
clearly the biggest threat.

07:36.286 --> 07:38.160
Why would Kramer go in

07:38.163 --> 07:40.081
and not take the male out first ?

07:40.241 --> 07:41.857
Maybe he was saving him.

07:43.316 --> 07:45.734
Well, it looks like I need
to see the autopsy on Mike Lewis.

07:45.735 --> 07:46.652
Thank you.

07:53.859 --> 07:56.422
We need to examine
Mike Lewis's clothes.

07:56.812 --> 07:58.631
Speedle already did,
five years ago.

07:59.749 --> 08:01.411
You need to move past it, Eric.

08:01.638 --> 08:04.111
And I think you were
a little hard on Ryan earlier.

08:04.209 --> 08:05.586
You're always protecting him.

08:05.809 --> 08:08.477
Speedle's case has been reopened
and I know that you're frustrated,

08:08.574 --> 08:11.157
but you can't start
taking it out on other people.

08:11.365 --> 08:13.502
So you're going
to analyze me now ?

08:13.591 --> 08:15.322
How are things going
with the union shrink ?

08:15.410 --> 08:16.136
They're going.

08:17.466 --> 08:18.666
Why don't we just get to this.

08:18.760 --> 08:20.375
I just know from my own experience

08:20.376 --> 08:22.295
that when people are upset,
they make mistakes.

08:22.388 --> 08:24.094
Thanks for the vote of confidence.

08:24.999 --> 08:25.732
Eric

08:26.276 --> 08:28.589
I trust you with
every fiber of my being,

08:29.148 --> 08:30.463
and you know that.

08:31.214 --> 08:31.880
Okay ?

08:34.683 --> 08:37.400
Will you walk me through
Speedle's original examination ?

08:37.511 --> 08:39.096
He ran all the usual tests.

08:39.246 --> 08:41.621
He collected hair and fibers
from the victim's clothes.

08:41.688 --> 08:44.445
Sent blood swatches
to Valera in DNA.

08:44.491 --> 08:45.821
All point to the ax-man.

08:46.428 --> 08:48.653
Except five years ago,
we didn't have the EDAX.

08:48.842 --> 08:49.946
X-ray vision.

08:55.784 --> 08:57.202
I love this machine.

08:57.284 --> 09:00.331
Elemental analysis
without one test tube.

09:02.314 --> 09:04.134
There's something
on Mike Lewis's collar.

09:09.228 --> 09:10.571
Tiny spheres.

09:13.258 --> 09:15.782
It's a high concentration of cobalt.

09:16.249 --> 09:19.394
Isn't cobalt used to make
airplanes or diamonds ?

09:19.479 --> 09:21.224
Yeah. Among other things.

09:21.283 --> 09:23.084
Victims were lawyers.

09:23.232 --> 09:25.283
Had no reason to be
in contact with cobalt.

09:25.284 --> 09:27.528
Either would the ax-man ;
he was an accountant.

09:28.251 --> 09:29.964
Yeah, I remember the case.

09:30.288 --> 09:32.352
You try to let them go
with the toe tag.

09:32.654 --> 09:34.128
Some you just can't.

09:34.291 --> 09:36.530
I want to compare
the injuries, Alexx.

09:36.661 --> 09:37.313
Okay.

09:37.483 --> 09:39.108
Let's start with Mike Lewis.

09:39.392 --> 09:40.880
Wounds are tentative.

09:41.305 --> 09:43.277
Only two lacerations.

09:47.350 --> 09:49.181
Superficial. Neither hit bone.

09:49.182 --> 09:51.880
So his COD was asphyxiation, right ?

09:51.892 --> 09:53.639
Yeah, ligature strangulation.

09:53.640 --> 09:56.040
Guy grabbed some boat
rope from the scene.

10:07.084 --> 10:09.681
Okay, here's Sheri Vanover's dress.

10:11.708 --> 10:13.295
There is cobalt again.

10:16.360 --> 10:18.634
Now, we didn't find any cobalt
on Ken Kramer's shirt,

10:18.755 --> 10:19.807
but look at that pattern.

10:19.910 --> 10:21.268
It's all over her shoulders.

10:21.711 --> 10:23.522
Someone was holding her down.

10:28.699 --> 10:31.560
It couldn't have been the ax-man
because if it was all over her clothes,

10:31.561 --> 10:32.978
it would've gotten on his, too.

10:39.632 --> 10:41.815
Oh, God, Eric,
you know what this means ?

10:42.268 --> 10:43.750
So Kramer had a partner ?

10:43.879 --> 10:45.042
Kramer had a partner.

10:45.147 --> 10:46.431
Well, why wouldn't he say anything ?

10:46.432 --> 10:48.065
I mean, the guy's
already on death row.

10:48.291 --> 10:49.500
Because maybe

10:49.506 --> 10:51.046
his partner's not done yet.

11:45.795 --> 11:47.416
I've seen you on the news.

11:54.378 --> 11:57.073
I know you had help on
the beach house murders.

11:58.070 --> 11:59.421
Male or female ?

12:01.814 --> 12:02.840
Ken, did you ?

12:04.367 --> 12:04.943
Ken,

12:05.174 --> 12:06.658
that could be exculpatory evidence.

12:06.902 --> 12:08.209
I did the crime,

12:08.318 --> 12:10.390
I got the stones to do the time.

12:11.237 --> 12:13.408
All the way up to the needle.

12:14.079 --> 12:15.602
We're trying to help you.

12:15.713 --> 12:17.684
I never asked for it,
and I don't want it.

12:17.750 --> 12:19.011
Leave it alone,

12:20.181 --> 12:22.398
and take your ACLU ass
on out of here.

12:26.023 --> 12:28.092
Lieutenant, reciprocity's in order.

12:28.180 --> 12:29.543
If there's someone else,
it could clear my client.

12:29.546 --> 12:30.881
Just because he had help

12:30.972 --> 12:32.791
doesn't mean he's
innocent, counselor.

12:32.886 --> 12:34.413
Could be enough to
move him off death row.

12:34.515 --> 12:36.634
Yes. It could also mean

12:36.704 --> 12:38.192
he's about to get company.

13:05.798 --> 13:07.318
What're we looking for ?

13:07.467 --> 13:10.603
Kramer's accomplice may have
been communicating with him.

13:10.685 --> 13:11.112
How ?

13:11.123 --> 13:12.587
All the mail is pre-opened and scanned.

13:12.633 --> 13:14.435
You can get drugs in here...

13:16.335 --> 13:18.505
you can get a message.
Hang on a second.

13:19.013 --> 13:19.500
Ray.

13:20.008 --> 13:21.097
Yeah, what's up, buddy ?

13:21.825 --> 13:23.464
Uh, uh... Slow down.

13:24.336 --> 13:24.840
Is...

13:25.200 --> 13:26.481
Is your mother there ?

13:27.362 --> 13:27.996
Ray.

13:28.303 --> 13:29.512
Did he hurt her ?

13:29.816 --> 13:33.171
Okay. Just stay there.
I'll be right over.

13:44.747 --> 13:46.429
Horatio. Pleasant surprise.

13:46.510 --> 13:48.133
Better be okay in there.

13:49.475 --> 13:50.823
It'd take a magician.

13:51.729 --> 13:53.191
Don't worry.
She can take care of herself.

13:53.198 --> 13:54.698
Walk, Rick...

13:54.911 --> 13:56.145
And don't come back.

14:08.733 --> 14:09.425
You okay ?

14:10.670 --> 14:11.719
I am now.

14:12.717 --> 14:14.783
Looks like you didn't
need me after all.

14:15.652 --> 14:16.847
That's not true,

14:18.072 --> 14:20.001
and that will never be true.

14:21.184 --> 14:22.357
Is Ray here ?

14:22.764 --> 14:23.167
Yeah.

14:26.799 --> 14:27.852
I'll go get him.

14:30.164 --> 14:30.769
Ray!

14:37.460 --> 14:39.059
I never really liked that guy.

14:39.397 --> 14:41.222
Well, Ray, you've got good judgment.

14:43.004 --> 14:43.845
It's weird.

14:45.683 --> 14:47.671
I thought once
my mom was seeing him,

14:48.565 --> 14:51.101
I wouldn't miss my dad so much, but

14:51.519 --> 14:53.015
now I miss him more.

14:54.800 --> 14:56.227
I know how you feel.

15:00.146 --> 15:01.973
I think about his funeral.

15:02.653 --> 15:04.137
When I saw his casket,

15:05.666 --> 15:08.690
I knew it was him,
but I was too scared to look.

15:10.339 --> 15:11.599
We all were.

15:12.730 --> 15:14.678
I just wanted to
see him one last time.

15:15.888 --> 15:18.033
You know, Ray,
we all have regrets,

15:19.041 --> 15:23.000
and your dad's boss has decided
we should remember your dad

15:23.000 --> 15:24.271
the way he was.

15:25.562 --> 15:26.692
You understand ?

15:40.622 --> 15:42.478
I heard the print lab came up empty.

15:43.306 --> 15:45.396
Yeah, whoever sent them
must've worn gloves.

15:45.890 --> 15:48.634
Why is an ax murderer
interested in a gossip column ?

15:48.839 --> 15:50.783
We've checked all his close friends.

15:56.841 --> 15:57.774
I don't know.

15:58.431 --> 16:00.487
I don't see a unifying message.

16:01.609 --> 16:03.803
Not even between
the underlined passages.

16:05.176 --> 16:07.352
You know what ?
Maybe it's not what was cut out.

16:07.352 --> 16:08.846
Maybe it's how it was cut.

16:09.353 --> 16:10.286
Look at these. These

16:10.286 --> 16:12.873
two edges seem like they could
have been made by the same tool.

16:18.171 --> 16:20.131
Okay, let's say we narrow down
the tool marks,

16:20.131 --> 16:23.388
figure out if our guy's using
sewing scissors, or

16:23.473 --> 16:26.619
construction, medical...

16:26.758 --> 16:28.845
Still doesn't tell us
what he's communicating.

16:29.223 --> 16:31.851
Well, so, it's a start.
Will you grab the camera ?

16:52.755 --> 16:53.770
Oh, my God.

16:54.212 --> 16:54.950
Ryan.

16:55.711 --> 16:57.735
- What ?
- Look at this newsprint.

16:58.331 --> 17:00.200
"... assaulted last night."

17:00.418 --> 17:03.334
And this one--
"Male stabbed repeatedly."

17:05.400 --> 17:06.638
"Victim of a hit-and-run."

17:07.576 --> 17:10.198
It's not the underlined articles.
It's what's on the back of them.

17:10.213 --> 17:11.883
The violence is the message.

17:12.141 --> 17:13.536
We've got to get a hold
of the full articles.

17:13.536 --> 17:14.770
You know what ?
Forget the articles.

17:14.858 --> 17:16.071
Let's get the case files.

17:34.271 --> 17:35.393
Okay. hypothetically,

17:35.437 --> 17:38.055
and no bias, let's assume
the ax-man's partner sent him

17:38.064 --> 17:39.327
news of these crimes.

17:39.529 --> 17:41.779
He'd have to know
the details of the attacks.

17:42.153 --> 17:43.840
This one was first one.

17:45.702 --> 17:46.770
Wayne Sanders

17:46.994 --> 17:50.131
36.
Tallahassee. Hit-and-run.

17:52.026 --> 17:52.798
Let's see...

18:08.748 --> 18:10.674
They said he didn't see the driver.

18:10.973 --> 18:12.005
Guy survived ?

18:12.103 --> 18:13.867
He's paralyzed for life.

18:14.648 --> 18:16.294
Has all his faculties.

18:16.485 --> 18:18.595
Paint evidence points to
an American-made sedan.

18:18.595 --> 18:19.643
No eyewits.

18:20.645 --> 18:22.001
PD's hit a dead end.

18:23.388 --> 18:24.700
Orlando's next.

18:25.161 --> 18:28.662
Bradley Birch.
31. BFT baseball bat.

18:28.790 --> 18:30.852
Victim is still in a coma.

18:32.677 --> 18:34.890
He was assaulted
right outside his home,

18:34.979 --> 18:36.296
and there were no leads.

18:59.731 --> 19:01.598
This is the most recent one.

19:02.094 --> 19:03.374
A month ago.

19:04.403 --> 19:07.135
Henry Walker.
33. Fort Lauderdale.

19:07.280 --> 19:08.184
A stabbing.

19:38.226 --> 19:38.964
Murder.

19:39.991 --> 19:42.080
Hit with a car,
hit with a bat,

19:42.225 --> 19:43.413
and stabbed.

19:43.666 --> 19:45.108
The crimes are
getting more personal.

19:45.205 --> 19:46.496
They're escalating.

19:46.611 --> 19:48.524
For his own benefit,
or for Kramer's ?

19:48.617 --> 19:49.479
I don't know.

19:50.447 --> 19:52.201
Horatio may have more insight.

19:53.209 --> 19:55.085
He's trying to impress you, Ken.

19:55.567 --> 19:57.089
I don't know who you mean.

20:02.027 --> 20:04.712
He sends you clippings
about his murders,

20:05.452 --> 20:07.268
and you don't know
who I'm talking about ?

20:07.370 --> 20:09.202
Probably one of my fans.

20:10.097 --> 20:12.122
You wouldn't believe
the stuff I get in the mail.

20:12.214 --> 20:14.897
You and I both know
that if there's another killer,

20:14.903 --> 20:16.203
it could spring you, right ?

20:16.260 --> 20:17.546
You don't understand.

20:18.575 --> 20:19.827
Gary Gilmore ?

20:21.588 --> 20:22.825
He understood.

20:23.128 --> 20:24.679
"Let's do it", right ?

20:31.935 --> 20:33.599
I get this weight on me.

20:34.340 --> 20:36.804
All over me,
like a big coat, you know ?

20:37.944 --> 20:39.310
And the only way I can...

20:42.306 --> 20:43.672
When I do a kill...

20:46.700 --> 20:48.162
I feel lighter.

20:49.448 --> 20:51.099
Sloughs right off me,
you know ?

20:51.698 --> 20:52.773
Dead weight.

20:54.483 --> 20:55.557
I won't feel it.

20:56.903 --> 20:58.201
Good to know, Ken.

20:58.507 --> 20:59.180
Caine !

21:06.778 --> 21:08.708
Million-dollar opportunity.

21:09.893 --> 21:12.408
Aren't you gonna ask me
what this guy is gonna do next ?

21:12.519 --> 21:13.765
You just told me.

21:16.742 --> 21:17.909
Son of a bitch.

21:54.724 --> 21:55.556
ALT.

21:55.916 --> 21:57.333
Homicide's ten away.

21:59.513 --> 22:00.903
What do we have here ?

22:01.009 --> 22:02.990
Same location, same MO.

22:03.030 --> 22:03.669
Two vics :

22:03.817 --> 22:05.118
one male, one female.

22:06.085 --> 22:07.603
Checked for breathing. Nothing.

22:08.074 --> 22:09.721
Just waiting on Rescue to pronounce.

22:11.841 --> 22:14.723
The name on the mailbox
was Trevor and Chloe Grant.

22:15.651 --> 22:16.574
Okay.

22:41.021 --> 22:43.846
Have Rescue roll a
Code Three. She's alive !

22:44.437 --> 22:45.157
Ma'am ?

23:07.071 --> 23:08.769
I want to get a jump
on the murder weapon.

23:08.775 --> 23:10.437
DNA, trace, then prints.

23:10.438 --> 23:12.506
Check it for cobalt, please.

23:12.744 --> 23:13.540
Will do.

23:14.210 --> 23:15.320
Horatio, what are we going to do

23:15.327 --> 23:17.507
about Kramer's attorney
when he gets wind of this ?

23:18.129 --> 23:20.548
This could clear Kramer--
same MO, same house.

23:20.737 --> 23:22.144
Except this time...

23:22.462 --> 23:23.876
we've got a witness.

23:28.109 --> 23:29.452
How you feeling, ma'am ?

23:32.470 --> 23:35.037
We were reading the paper.
There's this, uh, a guy...

23:35.037 --> 23:36.364
He's at the back door. He...

23:36.946 --> 23:40.124
he's lost his cell on the beach.
Can he use the phone ?

23:40.760 --> 23:42.397
Trevor opens the door.

23:42.473 --> 23:44.613
I hear this sound. It's a rip.

23:45.489 --> 23:46.612
He was wrapping tape...

23:47.527 --> 23:48.413
around...

23:49.299 --> 23:49.809
him.

23:49.890 --> 23:50.563
And

23:50.862 --> 23:52.686
he's got this, uh...

23:53.452 --> 23:54.804
he's got an ax.

23:55.655 --> 23:56.656
And he's chopping...

23:58.493 --> 23:59.183
He's chopping.

24:00.092 --> 24:01.992
I-I'm screaming,
"What do you want ?"

24:02.663 --> 24:04.128
He wouldn't...

24:05.745 --> 24:07.083
Did you recognize him ?

24:07.499 --> 24:08.630
No.

24:09.655 --> 24:11.339
Here you go. This'll help.

24:11.420 --> 24:12.358
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

24:12.418 --> 24:13.795
Is your neck injured ?

24:13.913 --> 24:16.474
He was, uh, he was
trying to strangle me.

24:18.850 --> 24:20.977
He strangled you.
Did he use a rope ?

24:21.044 --> 24:23.350
Uh, his hands. Just his hands.

24:23.941 --> 24:25.296
And I thought,

24:25.412 --> 24:27.193
"This is how I'm going to die,"

24:27.985 --> 24:28.704
and I begged.

24:29.359 --> 24:30.994
Please don't kill me.

24:32.633 --> 24:33.709
Please.

24:39.790 --> 24:41.350
I must've passed out.

24:41.564 --> 24:43.646
If it would be okay, I'd
like to have an investigator

24:43.653 --> 24:45.543
take some evidence from your neck.

24:45.948 --> 24:46.687
It's okay.

24:47.558 --> 24:48.976
- Get some rest.
- Ok.

25:10.332 --> 25:10.959
Hey.

25:11.726 --> 25:12.652
Got your call.

25:12.519 --> 25:14.724
Thought we already went
through the Mike Lewis photos.

25:14.725 --> 25:17.080
Yeah, I'd like to take
another look at his neck.

25:21.562 --> 25:22.590
You see the...

25:24.464 --> 25:27.101
the bruising is wider around
the ligature, isn't it ?

25:27.140 --> 25:28.713
Yeah, I found that
the first time.

25:28.823 --> 25:30.998
It sometimes happens
when the rope slips.

25:31.104 --> 25:31.898
Did it ?

25:32.600 --> 25:33.099
No.

25:34.201 --> 25:36.795
There's no abraded tissue
to account for that.

25:36.823 --> 25:39.170
I'd say it's from Kramer
using his hands first.

25:39.173 --> 25:41.308
See, Alexx, I don't think
this is Kramer's work.

25:41.308 --> 25:43.302
I think it's his partner's work.

25:43.411 --> 25:46.087
But Kramer's DNA was found
on the ends of the rope.

25:46.088 --> 25:48.666
That's not the part of the rope
I'm concerned with.

25:48.687 --> 25:49.387
Thank you.

25:50.579 --> 25:52.725
No one ever swabbed
the middle of the rope.

25:53.181 --> 25:54.209
I mean, they wouldn't.

25:54.217 --> 25:55.404
It's not protocol or anything.

25:55.514 --> 25:57.184
I don't want to get anyone in trouble.

25:57.185 --> 25:59.496
No worries. This is based
on new information.

25:59.497 --> 26:01.384
Now, Talcott, I believe

26:01.570 --> 26:03.831
that someone manually strangled Lewis

26:03.831 --> 26:05.036
before they used the rope.

26:10.939 --> 26:12.799
Oh, so you're looking
for DNA transfer.

26:21.286 --> 26:23.589
I'll do it right now, see if
there are any foreign epithelials.

26:24.700 --> 26:25.199
Okay, I'll be right back.

26:56.246 --> 26:58.749
You were right. There's
a ton of DNA on that rope ;

26:58.995 --> 27:01.594
it's male, but doesn't match
Kramer, at least not quite.

27:01.702 --> 27:03.414
The DNA's familial.

27:04.248 --> 27:07.066
Whoever tried to strangle Mike
Lewis, was related to Kramer.

27:07.144 --> 27:07.665
Thank you.

27:10.787 --> 27:11.676
Yeah, Eric.

27:11.940 --> 27:13.481
Ax-man's family--

27:13.745 --> 27:15.323
I want to know everything.

27:25.567 --> 27:26.349
I'm sorry ;

27:26.350 --> 27:28.773
if you didn't get a phone call
last week, you're not eligible.

27:28.784 --> 27:30.437
That's a scam.

27:34.235 --> 27:35.133
I got a call.

27:36.051 --> 27:37.310
Does that mean I'm a winner ?

27:37.495 --> 27:39.746
- Yeah, what's your name ?
- It's, uh, Kramer. Jesse Kramer.

27:40.536 --> 27:41.705
I win the TV ?

27:41.747 --> 27:42.766
Yeah, close.

27:43.339 --> 27:45.997
You won a nice pair
of pretty bracelets.

27:46.313 --> 27:46.918
Turn around.

27:47.027 --> 27:47.546
What's going on ?

27:47.547 --> 27:48.321
Put your hands behind you.

27:48.424 --> 27:49.234
What's going on ?

27:50.015 --> 27:51.470
Mind if I have a look in your truck ?

27:52.110 --> 27:52.579
No.

27:53.802 --> 27:55.042
What's this about ?

27:55.201 --> 27:57.167
Couple got attacked
today at a beach house.

27:57.326 --> 27:59.075
I don't know anything
about an attack.

27:59.526 --> 28:00.178
Really ?

28:00.931 --> 28:02.408
What about five years ago ?

28:02.924 --> 28:04.948
Same house, you know
anything about that ?

28:05.853 --> 28:07.389
That was my brother, Ken.

28:07.543 --> 28:09.137
It was in all the papers.

28:14.593 --> 28:15.623
What do you got ?

28:16.937 --> 28:18.751
Keeping your duct tape fresh ?

28:18.875 --> 28:20.035
I don't know.

28:20.149 --> 28:22.744
It's the same kind of tape that
was used in the beach house murders.

28:23.884 --> 28:25.446
I don't know how that got there.

28:25.501 --> 28:28.053
Yeah, well maybe it'll come to you
while you're sitting in holding.

28:28.057 --> 28:29.794
Yeah, right after we get your DNA.

28:38.943 --> 28:40.443
We have a match.

28:40.620 --> 28:41.613
Today's murder ?

28:41.991 --> 28:43.845
No. Five years ago.
Same house.

28:43.914 --> 28:45.093
I'll have him brought up.

28:45.201 --> 28:47.039
All right, I'll go by DNA.
I'll meet you over there.

28:50.455 --> 28:53.173
Tape that was used in the murders
of Mike Lewis and his girlfriend

28:53.357 --> 28:55.315
matches the one
we found in your toolbox.

28:55.321 --> 28:56.458
You want to explain that to me ?

29:00.098 --> 29:02.860
I beat the cops over to my brother's
place that morning. I swiped it.

29:03.096 --> 29:05.401
So you were hiding evidence.
Makes you an accomplice.

29:07.212 --> 29:09.461
Thought I could get a
few bucks for it on e-Bay.

29:09.832 --> 29:11.339
Oh, now that's a good story.

29:11.429 --> 29:13.993
Some guys got baseball's
from Barry Bonds.

29:14.560 --> 29:16.593
- I got famous tape.
- Well, you're lying.

29:16.594 --> 29:17.567
No, I'm not lying.

29:17.709 --> 29:18.919
He's not lying, Frank.

29:19.489 --> 29:22.502
Preliminary DNA already
has allelic discrepancies.

29:22.513 --> 29:23.680
Doesn't match the epithelials

29:23.681 --> 29:25.500
on the rope from
the original ax murder.

29:25.568 --> 29:28.270
See ? Told you. Could I have
my truck keys back ?

29:28.276 --> 29:30.130
Not before you walk us
through your family tree.

29:30.131 --> 29:31.357
You have any other relatives ?

29:31.415 --> 29:31.765
No.

29:31.776 --> 29:33.547
Dad ? Grandfather ? Uncle ?

29:33.547 --> 29:34.399
Dead, dead and dead.

29:34.408 --> 29:35.812
No male relatives ?

29:35.841 --> 29:37.896
You have got it in for my family.

29:38.116 --> 29:39.530
Listen, dumb-ass.

29:39.590 --> 29:41.044
DNA evidence tells us

29:41.044 --> 29:43.997
that a male relative of yours
was at that crime scene

29:44.391 --> 29:44.899
okay ?

29:45.052 --> 29:46.286
That's science.

29:48.140 --> 29:49.361
I got a cousin.

29:50.179 --> 29:52.003
I lost track of him a long time ago.

29:52.082 --> 29:53.515
Good. What's his name ?

29:53.744 --> 29:54.812
Lawrence Hargrove.

29:55.196 --> 29:56.567
Goes by Larry.

30:05.448 --> 30:06.940
Looks like "Larry"
doesn't want to be found.

30:09.245 --> 30:10.598
Tax records go
to an old apartment.

30:13.466 --> 30:15.213
Driver's license, too.

30:15.513 --> 30:16.765
No arrest record.

30:16.831 --> 30:18.430
Not even a parking ticket.

30:18.709 --> 30:19.874
Guy's in the wind.

30:20.608 --> 30:23.285
Yeah, but he did leave us
something at the beach house.

30:23.312 --> 30:24.133
Murder weapon ?

30:24.306 --> 30:26.838
Yeah, may be able
to trace him off that.

30:30.617 --> 30:32.594
Log says you took the ax
from the scene today.

30:32.659 --> 30:33.819
Yeah, it's right here.
I was just gonna...

30:33.819 --> 30:34.691
Run it for cobalt ?

30:37.610 --> 30:39.099
Already did. It's positive.

30:40.385 --> 30:42.551
Speedle didn't have EDAX
when he did this.

30:42.578 --> 30:43.604
Couldn't have seen the cobalt.

30:43.997 --> 30:44.700
You know what, Delko ?

30:44.824 --> 30:45.992
I don't know what
the hell's going on,

30:45.995 --> 30:47.507
but I'm not trying
to outdo Speedle.

30:47.852 --> 30:49.616
I don't want to compete
with a dead man.

30:50.110 --> 30:51.586
You compete with everybody else.

30:52.661 --> 30:54.226
I'm just trying to get the facts.

30:55.991 --> 30:57.190
Fine. What are they ?

30:57.238 --> 30:58.138
I looked up cobalt.

30:58.138 --> 30:59.947
Around here, it's used as
a drying agent, and it helps

30:59.947 --> 31:01.957
stain wood in humid conditions.

31:02.083 --> 31:03.641
So our guy works with wood.

31:04.637 --> 31:06.743
That narrows it down
to about 10,000 things.

31:06.743 --> 31:09.175
I know, but I found
something else that might.

31:09.933 --> 31:12.579
Some kind of gray dust.

31:15.515 --> 31:16.985
Based on the birefringence,

31:16.985 --> 31:18.561
I'd say it looks like slate.

31:18.683 --> 31:21.339
What kind of job uses
stained wood and slate ?

31:30.479 --> 31:32.208
You have another angle
on Sheri Vanover ?

31:32.247 --> 31:34.550
Could swear there was
a pool table in the room.

31:34.554 --> 31:35.761
Yeah, hang on.

31:39.488 --> 31:42.099
You want to tell me why you're
so interested in the pool table ?

31:43.043 --> 31:43.938
There it is.

31:44.706 --> 31:46.866
What about the Fort Lauderdale murder ?

31:49.818 --> 31:53.934
Pool table is made of stained wood.
That's where the cobalt comes from.

31:53.959 --> 31:55.641
And the top's made of slate.

31:59.545 --> 32:02.015
Looks like cousin Larry
builds pool tables.

32:02.211 --> 32:04.284
Yeah, or at least installs them.

32:05.052 --> 32:06.316
What's that look like to you ?

32:07.666 --> 32:09.628
Looks like Larry's
behind the eight ball.

32:11.977 --> 32:13.816
Called Tallahassee
and Orlando PDs.

32:13.816 --> 32:16.429
They confirmed. The victims from
the articles had pool tables.

32:16.423 --> 32:17.360
Get a make ?

32:17.369 --> 32:18.802
Custom. Hand-carved.

32:18.802 --> 32:20.572
Assembled on the buyers' premises.

32:20.572 --> 32:23.075
So cousin Larry had contact
with the victims,

32:23.075 --> 32:24.433
and he chose them, didn't he ?

32:24.433 --> 32:27.102
Explains why they didn't find a
link with Kramer : there wasn't one.

32:27.106 --> 32:29.960
- What about a manufacturer ?
- Brando Billiards. Miami.

32:29.960 --> 32:31.836
- Let's go see if they know Larry.
- Allright.

33:11.181 --> 33:12.344
Miami-Dade Police !

33:12.788 --> 33:14.228
Larry Hargrove !

33:27.061 --> 33:28.082
Larry Hargrove ?

33:30.440 --> 33:32.709
- I haven't done anything.
- You're under arrest.

33:33.020 --> 33:34.061
What ? What for ?

33:34.170 --> 33:36.394
Murder. Three counts.

33:36.620 --> 33:37.516
Take him.

34:08.342 --> 34:09.569
Ken give me up ?

34:09.779 --> 34:12.246
No, Larry, he didn't.

34:13.273 --> 34:14.503
Didn't think so.

34:15.329 --> 34:17.264
My cousin's not the only tough guy.

34:17.453 --> 34:19.157
There's nothing tough about murder.

34:19.295 --> 34:21.118
- You've done it ?
- Shut up.

34:21.657 --> 34:23.286
We have evidence on you, Larry.

34:23.380 --> 34:25.864
You're not only responsible for
the current beach house murder,

34:25.864 --> 34:28.212
but you were an accomplice
for the ones five years ago.

34:28.212 --> 34:30.880
Five years ago,
you selected the victims.

34:30.679 --> 34:33.147
You went to the beach house
with your cousin.

34:35.822 --> 34:36.955
Take him out ;

34:36.987 --> 34:38.993
I'm going to finish up
his little lady.

34:50.494 --> 34:51.428
Hit the man.

34:51.658 --> 34:52.538
Hit the man.

35:01.290 --> 35:03.919
But when it came time
to kill those people,

35:04.332 --> 35:05.809
you didn't have the stomach,

35:06.532 --> 35:07.389
did you ?

35:11.839 --> 35:14.129
Ah, come on.

35:14.613 --> 35:15.529
Do it.

35:16.336 --> 35:17.954
I can't concentrate.

35:18.435 --> 35:19.628
Watch this.

35:36.060 --> 35:38.064
I was weak, pathetic.

35:41.856 --> 35:43.628
Get out of my way,
get out of my way.

35:44.662 --> 35:46.464
Uh-uh ; here we go.

35:54.212 --> 35:56.796
Ooh ! That's how you do it.

35:57.388 --> 35:58.769
That's how you do it.

35:58.940 --> 36:00.232
That's how you do it.

36:01.740 --> 36:04.229
And now you're determined
to show your cousin

36:04.314 --> 36:05.795
that you're getting
tougher, right ?

36:07.700 --> 36:09.635
He told me to ease into it.

36:10.304 --> 36:11.221
That it would get easier.

36:11.221 --> 36:14.142
What an odd thing
to strive for, Larry.

36:15.160 --> 36:16.194
He was right.

36:17.641 --> 36:18.439
It did.

36:19.678 --> 36:20.878
You wouldn't understand.

36:20.896 --> 36:24.312
Your cousin is a sociopath
who kills without conscience.

36:24.312 --> 36:25.767
I do understand.

36:26.298 --> 36:28.918
I wanted to be that tough.
To be like him.

36:29.190 --> 36:30.296
And now...

36:30.747 --> 36:31.751
you can be.

36:32.655 --> 36:33.718
Frank.

36:37.770 --> 36:39.228
You have the right
to remain silent...

37:08.023 --> 37:09.486
We found your cousin.

37:12.761 --> 37:13.732
Good for you.

37:13.821 --> 37:15.880
Don't like to share
the limelight, do you ?

37:16.505 --> 37:17.829
Nothing to share.

37:19.262 --> 37:20.984
Larry didn't kill my couple.

37:23.501 --> 37:25.225
Couldn't even strangle the guy.

37:25.498 --> 37:26.849
So, you did it for him.

37:27.472 --> 37:28.908
You're weak. Get out of my way.

37:29.048 --> 37:29.788
Get out of my way.

37:30.012 --> 37:31.472
Uh-uh, here we go.

37:31.553 --> 37:33.196
Embarrassing, man.

37:34.017 --> 37:35.899
That's why you didn't
give him up, right, Ken ?

37:35.904 --> 37:37.492
'Cause he's not up
to your standards.

37:37.771 --> 37:38.787
Hell, yeah.

37:39.979 --> 37:42.508
I didn't want that little
pansy associated with me.

37:42.615 --> 37:45.598
Two murders, three attempts--
that's not too bad.

38:02.460 --> 38:04.219
Wouldn't count that hit-and-run.

38:04.894 --> 38:06.896
My grandmother could've done that.

38:09.400 --> 38:10.714
But he learned.

38:10.785 --> 38:12.622
And every time
he sent you an article,

38:12.732 --> 38:14.968
you found out just
how much, didn't you ?

38:28.555 --> 38:31.398
Mail call's been
the highlight of my day.

38:32.524 --> 38:33.613
You know what ?

38:34.171 --> 38:36.062
That's about to change, Ken.

38:37.273 --> 38:39.459
They've rescheduled
your execution.

38:40.531 --> 38:41.477
Yeah ?

38:42.721 --> 38:43.341
When ?

38:44.034 --> 38:44.873
Tomorrow.

38:45.040 --> 38:45.784
Midnight.

38:50.569 --> 38:51.515
Think so ?

38:54.700 --> 38:57.036
Stick around for a little surprise.

38:57.476 --> 38:59.946
At this point, Ken, nothing,

39:00.239 --> 39:03.148
nothing would surprise me.

39:15.250 --> 39:17.834
I wanted you to see
a picture of my son

39:18.381 --> 39:20.197
the way I remember him.

39:20.286 --> 39:21.999
He would have been 34

39:21.999 --> 39:23.639
in the spring.

39:24.642 --> 39:25.805
Great-looking young man.

39:25.823 --> 39:26.599
Thank you.

39:50.787 --> 39:52.335
Some days, I forget.

39:53.197 --> 39:55.479
I wake up in the morning,
and it's like,

39:55.936 --> 39:56.981
for a second,

39:58.019 --> 40:00.760
it's like nothing ever happened--
like he's still alive.

40:04.364 --> 40:05.989
- You know ?
- I do.

40:26.391 --> 40:29.419
If they hadn't reopened
the case, that other man

40:29.531 --> 40:32.301
would still be out there
hurting people, so...

40:32.305 --> 40:36.096
Mrs. Lewis, they're not going
to do any more damage to anyone.

40:36.187 --> 40:37.002
I just

40:37.007 --> 40:39.164
want to make sure
they don't call it off again.

40:39.208 --> 40:40.180
It won't happen.

40:40.324 --> 40:43.326
- Are you sure?
- I am.

40:50.848 --> 40:52.389
Stay back, Kramer.

40:54.804 --> 40:56.494
PB&J on white.

40:57.191 --> 40:58.337
Only the best.

40:58.751 --> 41:00.169
What happened to the steak ?

41:01.818 --> 41:03.567
Oh, I get it.

41:03.752 --> 41:06.198
You think this is
another false alarm.

41:06.995 --> 41:08.605
Think again, pal.

41:08.744 --> 41:10.905
You're all out of miracles.

42:12.276 --> 42:14.854
You ready to see a priest now ?

42:14.855 --> 42:15.541
Kramer.

42:16.486 --> 42:17.638
Kramer.

42:19.611 --> 42:21.227
Officer needs assistance.

42:21.916 --> 42:23.135
What do you mean, he collapsed ?

42:23.138 --> 42:25.656
I don't know. We called Rescue.
They're on the way.

42:30.447 --> 42:31.783
He's got no pulse.

42:32.409 --> 42:33.224
Is that it--

42:33.224 --> 42:35.072
his last meal ?
Peanut butter and jelly ?

42:35.340 --> 42:36.758
That's what he requested.

42:36.924 --> 42:39.102
You're telling me no one knew
he was allergic to peanuts ?

42:39.198 --> 42:40.607
It wasn't in any file.

42:40.734 --> 42:42.813
No way to know.
He'd have to tell us.
