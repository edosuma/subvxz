Previously
on "Ex on the Beach"...

00:03.636 --> 00:06.306
{\an8}Taylor got hit with
her second ex, Cameron,

00:06.373 --> 00:09.175
{\an8}and Victoria and Skyler
both wanted a piece.

00:09.242 --> 00:11.378
He is fine!

00:11.444 --> 00:13.446
{\an5}I have no reason--

00:11.444 --> 00:13.446
You can feel how
you wanna feel.

00:13.513 --> 00:15.415
You can be attracted to who
you wanna be attracted to.

00:15.482 --> 00:17.217
I don't like Victoria,
really.

00:17.283 --> 00:18.852
I don't like Skyler.

00:18.918 --> 00:21.554
{\an8}Jasmine and Tor'i were sent
to the Shack of Secrets,

00:21.621 --> 00:25.325
{\an8}where Angela got busted for
getting revenge against Tor'i

00:25.392 --> 00:27.560
{\an8}by hooking up with
her ex, Derrick.

00:27.627 --> 00:29.496
{\an5}(Angela)
I was there for you,
like you (bleeps).

00:29.562 --> 00:31.097
You did me
(bleep) wrong!

00:31.164 --> 00:32.932
{\an8}And Victoria
got rid of Skyler.

00:32.999 --> 00:36.136
Click your heels three times
and bitches go home.

00:36.202 --> 00:39.606
{\an8}And tonight, the exes
take control.

00:39.672 --> 00:43.543
"Exes, you will be eliminating
one of the OGs."

00:43.610 --> 00:45.311

00:45.378 --> 00:46.613
{\an1}(Haley)
Oh my God!

00:46.679 --> 00:48.481
{\an8}And Angela and Tor'i's
relationship

00:48.548 --> 00:50.383
{\an8}reaches its breaking point.

00:50.450 --> 00:52.018
{\an4}(Angela)
What the (bleep) else
does he want from me?!

00:52.085 --> 00:54.888
{\an1}I've done everything
for you!

00:54.954 --> 00:56.923
(thundering)

00:56.990 --> 00:59.559
{\an8}♪♪

01:01.828 --> 01:02.862
{\an8}Welcome back, everyone.

01:02.929 --> 01:04.631
{\an8}Here's where
things stand.

01:04.697 --> 01:06.933
{\an8}Chris is getting heated
that Derrick is flirting

01:07.000 --> 01:08.601
{\an8}with his ex, Haley.

01:08.668 --> 01:11.805
{\an8}Angela and Tor'i are trying
to salvage their relationship.

01:11.871 --> 01:15.475
{\an8}Victoria managed to kick
Chase's ex, Skyler, to the curb,

01:15.542 --> 01:17.811
{\an8}and with Cameron friend-zoning
Victoria,

01:17.877 --> 01:20.413
{\an8}she's back to her old fav Chase.

01:20.480 --> 01:22.148
{\an8}And with Skyler
out of the house

01:22.215 --> 01:24.150
{\an8}and more exes on the horizon,

01:24.217 --> 01:26.719
{\an8}Chase needs to blow off
some steam.

01:26.786 --> 01:30.156
{\an8}We can definitely
get it in out here.

01:30.223 --> 01:33.026
{\an5}(Chase)
Now that Skyler's gone,
I'm really bored in this house.

01:33.092 --> 01:35.728
Get that back,
get that back.

01:35.795 --> 01:37.363
{\an8}But right now
I kind of feel like

01:37.430 --> 01:39.599
{\an8}Tor'i and I are--
are jiving.

01:39.666 --> 01:42.202
(Tor'i)
Oh, that form is impeccable.

01:42.268 --> 01:43.770
Chase is a cool cat.

01:43.837 --> 01:45.872
{\an8}He's into fitness
and you know I'm into fitness,

01:45.939 --> 01:47.607
{\an8}so why not?

01:47.674 --> 01:48.808
(bleep) meatheads
out here.

01:48.875 --> 01:50.743
{\an3}I love it.

01:50.810 --> 01:55.014
{\an8}Just kind of someone that--
that is pure, you know?

01:55.081 --> 01:56.483
{\an8}He can drink

01:56.549 --> 01:58.451
but he can still
stay focused.

01:58.518 --> 01:59.719
So I think Tor'i right now

01:59.786 --> 02:01.721
is kind of my--
my guy that I like.

02:04.524 --> 02:06.860
{\an1}(Tor'i)
Oh, (bleep), yeah!

02:06.926 --> 02:08.728
(Tor'i grunting)

02:08.794 --> 02:09.963
I'm not gonna pursue
a relationship

02:10.029 --> 02:11.498

02:11.564 --> 02:12.499

02:13.766 --> 02:14.601
That's good.

02:14.667 --> 02:15.835
Yeah, you're
cool with it?

02:15.902 --> 02:17.670
{\an5}That's that goodness.

ever people freaking out

elimination.

I don't know, man,
it's interesting.

02:35.788 --> 02:37.357

took the elimination

circumstance,

02:39.325 --> 02:40.693

it would be such

a different vibe.

You know what I mean,

Angela wants me out of the house

02:52.739 --> 02:55.475
and knowing Cory's more loyal
to Big T than to me,

02:55.542 --> 02:58.144
I do kind of have to form some
alliances to protect my back

02:58.211 --> 03:01.314
{\an8}because I've been a target
pretty much every elimination.

03:01.381 --> 03:02.916
Since I walked in the house,
you know,

03:02.982 --> 03:04.551
I was the first
ex on the beach,

03:04.617 --> 03:07.520

03:19.966 --> 03:23.336
{\an8}We got Andre out of the house,
we got Alicia out of the house,

03:23.403 --> 03:25.305
we can finally build
that depth,

03:25.371 --> 03:27.106
we can finally
get to know each other better,

03:27.173 --> 03:28.641
and I can't wait to see
what happens.

03:30.376 --> 03:32.245
{\an8}How about you don't hook up
with other people

Me and Tor'i have been
in the pattern

03:42.522 --> 03:45.425
{\an8}of fight and make up
and fight and make up.

03:45.491 --> 03:47.093
{\an8}But at the end of the day,

03:47.160 --> 03:49.796
{\an8}I feel like I put so much
effort into our relationship.

03:49.862 --> 03:51.764
{\an8}We want this relationship

07:48.901 --> 07:50.670
text messages
here and there.

07:50.736 --> 07:53.406
And then I did end up hooking up
with that person too.

07:53.472 --> 07:55.174
How you feel about
Victoria, Luis?

07:55.241 --> 07:57.710
Did y'all leave
on the best of terms?

07:57.777 --> 07:59.545
{\an4}It was a pretty
rough exit.

07:57.777 --> 07:59.545
Yeah.

07:59.612 --> 08:01.147
It wasn't the best.

08:01.214 --> 08:02.849
{\an4}It could have been
a little better.

08:01.214 --> 08:02.849
It was a little abrupt.

08:02.915 --> 08:04.450
(Chase)
My first impression of Luis,

08:04.517 --> 08:06.018
kind of a meathead,

08:06.085 --> 08:08.788
{\an8}but is, you know, just
a little-- a little nugget.

08:08.855 --> 08:10.523
{\an8}Just a little thing...

08:10.590 --> 08:12.491
and not a threat
to me at all.

08:12.558 --> 08:13.593
What's going on?

08:13.659 --> 08:15.561
{\an5}Oh, a lot, a lot.

08:13.659 --> 08:15.561
{\an3}It's a lot.

08:15.628 --> 08:17.997

I might have another

ex-girlfriend coming,
and I'm kind of scared.

08:25.438 --> 08:26.439
Kind of worried.

08:26.505 --> 08:27.907
If it's not, I swear to God,

08:27.974 --> 08:30.009
I'm gonna throw this whole bench

{\an8}Originally from
New York City.

08:47.293 --> 08:49.795
{\an8}I have a reputation for

08:49.862 --> 08:51.964
getting the most beautiful
women out of the crew.

08:52.031 --> 08:53.532
(laughing)

08:53.599 --> 08:56.435
When they get to know me, they
definitely do fall hard for me.

08:56.502 --> 08:57.970
I met Faith in a club.

08:58.037 --> 09:01.774
{\an8}Me and her had a ridiculous
long one night together.

09:01.841 --> 09:04.110
I do believe something
can happen between us,

09:04.176 --> 09:06.112

Welcome to the party.

09:09.448 --> 09:10.449
{\an5}What's going on?

09:09.448 --> 09:10.449
What's going on?

09:10.516 --> 09:12.251

Look how cute looks.

{\an5}(Romeo)
June in the building.

09:12.318 --> 09:15.021
{\an1}Yes, sir, yes, sir,
yes, sir.

09:15.087 --> 09:16.689
You excited to see
Faith over there?

09:16.756 --> 09:19.091
{\an1}Oh yeah, I see her over there,
I see her over there.

09:20.192 --> 09:21.827
{\an5}Whoo-hoo...

09:20.192 --> 09:21.827
Faith, you look happy,

09:21.894 --> 09:23.863
like you just hit
the lotto right now.

09:23.930 --> 09:25.564
(Faith)
June's a very sexy man.

09:25.631 --> 09:27.767
We spent one amazing
magical night together.

09:27.833 --> 09:29.135
{\an8}But that's not the point.

09:29.201 --> 09:31.804
{\an8}The point is that
we have a connection

09:31.871 --> 09:34.573
{\an8}and there's wavelengths
and there's frequencies.

09:34.640 --> 09:36.142
(Romeo)
Welcome to the party.

09:36.208 --> 09:37.743
I'm gonna go ahead

(June)
Clean this off for me.

I knew it!

09:40.746 --> 09:42.181
Victoria and Faith,

09:42.248 --> 09:43.816
I'm gonna give y'all
some time to catch up

09:43.883 --> 09:45.484

09:56.729 --> 09:58.164
{\an1}So, why are you
here, June?

09:58.230 --> 10:00.399
Well, I'm here on this
beautiful island--

10:00.466 --> 10:03.536
the best place to probably
get to know who you are

10:03.602 --> 10:05.237
{\an5}actually
a little bit deeper.

10:03.602 --> 10:05.237
Right.

10:05.304 --> 10:06.806
So I think that's
what it's gonna be about.

10:06.872 --> 10:08.541
{\an1}Yeah, you know, you might
get to know that I'm--

10:08.607 --> 10:10.810
{\an4}that I have a little bit
of crazy in me.

10:08.607 --> 10:10.810
I'm out of here then.

10:10.876 --> 10:12.044
{\an5}(laughing)

10:10.876 --> 10:12.044
Out.

10:12.111 --> 10:14.080
(Faith)
You know, I'm a jealous girl.

10:14.146 --> 10:16.716
If I found out that June fell
for anyone in this house,

10:16.782 --> 10:18.284
{\an8}I'd probably
cut his (bleep) off,

10:18.351 --> 10:21.153
{\an8}sauté it with onions and some
tomatoes and garlic

10:21.220 --> 10:23.723
and I would serve it to him
like Hannibal Lecter.

10:25.424 --> 10:26.726
{\an1}I'm looking to take
things slow.

10:26.792 --> 10:28.094
I wanna get to know you,
you can get to know me,

10:28.160 --> 10:29.495
{\an1}'cause I'd rather fall
for my best friend anyway.

10:29.562 --> 10:30.896
Aww...

10:30.963 --> 10:32.098
{\an5}You know what I mean?

10:30.963 --> 10:32.098
I feel you, I feel you.

10:32.164 --> 10:33.599
{\an1}I can't wait to take
you to the house.

10:33.666 --> 10:35.067
I can't wait
to come to the house!

10:35.134 --> 10:36.936
{\an5}(Faith)
You gotta come
meet everybody.

10:37.003 --> 10:38.938
{\an8}(narrator)
Not even the sparks
of Faith and June's

10:39.005 --> 10:41.607
{\an8}rekindled relationship
could heat things up

10:41.674 --> 10:43.242
{\an8}for Victoria and Luis,

10:43.309 --> 10:46.846
{\an8}whose feelings for each other
are as cold as ice.

10:46.912 --> 10:49.782
We never really, uh,
actually had closure

10:49.849 --> 10:51.617
{\an4}on what did happen
at school.

10:49.849 --> 10:51.617
Yeah.

10:51.684 --> 10:53.486
A lot of things that
happened between us

10:53.552 --> 10:54.787
was, like, kind of like

10:54.854 --> 10:56.489
{\an5}he said/she said
type of thing.

10:54.854 --> 10:56.489
Mm-hmm.

10:56.555 --> 10:57.723
So, I feel like we were

10:57.790 --> 10:59.625
not always on
the same page.

10:59.692 --> 11:00.926
Like, obviously, like,

11:00.993 --> 11:02.428
{\an1}I had myself
there for you.

11:02.495 --> 11:04.697
I feel like-- like,
when we were together,

11:04.764 --> 11:06.298
hooking up and whatnot,

11:06.365 --> 11:10.269
um, I was kind of doing
my own thing.

11:10.336 --> 11:12.471
Like, not-- not so much

11:12.538 --> 11:14.340
in, like, hooking up
with other guys,

11:14.407 --> 11:16.642
but I didn't
really have a problem

11:16.709 --> 11:18.411
entertaining other people.

11:21.981 --> 11:23.883
{\an1}What do you mean by
"entertaining"?

11:23.949 --> 11:27.453
{\an5}(Victoria)
Um, I definitely have some
secrets that I kept from Luis.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.422
I don't think I ever
owed him that truth,

11:29.488 --> 11:32.158
{\an8}but I know it's about
to come out here.

11:32.224 --> 11:34.093
I'm (bleep) my pants
'cause I know that Luis

11:34.160 --> 11:35.928

the (bleep) out.

11:37.229 --> 11:38.597

11:38.664 --> 11:42.468
{\an8}I'm talking to Victoria
and she's... being 100% shady.

11:42.535 --> 11:44.136
She's avoiding questions,

11:44.203 --> 11:46.405
she's not giving me
straight-up answers,

11:46.472 --> 11:47.873
and I'm not vibing with it.

"Up until now."

12:39.959 --> 12:41.861
What about Victoria,
was she happy or...

12:41.927 --> 12:43.095
No, it sounds like
Victoria and her dude

12:43.162 --> 12:44.497
have some (bleep)
to figure out.

12:44.563 --> 12:45.898
Oh, (bleep).

12:45.965 --> 12:47.433
{\an1}I knew it,
I knew--

12:47.500 --> 12:49.301
It sounds like she screwed

{\an1}We're back...
with new people.

12:54.974 --> 12:56.242
(Lexi)
We missed you so much!

12:56.308 --> 12:57.276
Hi!

12:57.343 --> 12:58.577
Are you so excited?

12:58.644 --> 13:00.045
{\an1}(Luis)
What's up?

13:00.112 --> 13:01.947
{\an5}What's good?

13:00.112 --> 13:01.947
Hi, Jasmine,
nice to meet you.

13:02.014 --> 13:03.449
{\an1}Nice to meet you,
babe.

13:03.516 --> 13:05.951
{\an8}Luis walks in the door
and it's not what I expected

13:06.018 --> 13:07.486
{\an8}because I thought it was
gonna be this

13:07.553 --> 13:11.223
tall, like, Chase-type guy,
who's, like, tatted up,

13:11.290 --> 13:14.226
{\an8}and I'm like, "Hey, Luis,
how are you down there?"

13:14.293 --> 13:15.761
(laughing)

13:15.828 --> 13:18.731
{\an5}(Angela)
How was your day,
my little angel baby?

13:18.797 --> 13:21.066
I'm about to be
getting exposed.

13:21.133 --> 13:23.202
{\an8}(Cory)
So, Luis is in the house
and Victoria's

13:23.269 --> 13:26.205
{\an8}a little bit comprehensive
of him being in the house.

13:28.007 --> 13:29.175
Did I use that right?

13:29.241 --> 13:30.242
(bleep).

13:30.309 --> 13:31.777
Try to sound smart
for once.

13:31.844 --> 13:33.112
{\an1}You guys wanna
come upstairs with me?

13:33.179 --> 13:34.780
{\an5}I wanna change.

13:33.179 --> 13:34.780
Yeah, I wanna change too.

13:36.482 --> 13:38.751
{\an5}(Victoria)
There are some things
that I kept from Luis,

13:38.817 --> 13:40.719
and I think Luis is a pretty
sensitive guy.

13:40.786 --> 13:43.789
{\an8}I don't know where his head
or his heart is at right now.

13:43.856 --> 13:46.926
The main problem I think
in our relationship

13:46.992 --> 13:48.394
was communication.

13:48.460 --> 13:50.162
I was being told,
when we were together,

13:50.229 --> 13:53.098
like, don't trust him,
he's not the relationship type.

13:53.165 --> 13:55.367
And I didn't even question him

13:55.434 --> 13:56.869
or ever have a conversation
with him,

13:56.936 --> 13:58.470
and I did hook up
with other people.

13:58.537 --> 13:59.672
He never found out.

13:59.738 --> 14:01.240
He never, like,
(bleep) with that.

14:01.307 --> 14:03.142
{\an5}So, do you see anything
happening with you guys?

14:01.307 --> 14:03.142
No.

14:03.209 --> 14:04.643
{\an1}Like, are you gonna
reconcile, like--

14:04.710 --> 14:06.512
I'm truly not
interested in that way.

14:06.579 --> 14:07.680
{\an1}What is he
here for then?

14:07.746 --> 14:08.681
{\an5}Is he here for you?

14:07.746 --> 14:08.681
I don't know.

14:08.747 --> 14:10.416
{\an3}(Jasmine)
Answers.

14:10.482 --> 14:12.551
{\an5}He just wanna know,
"Did you cheat on me?"

14:10.482 --> 14:12.551
I don't know.

14:12.618 --> 14:14.486
{\an5}(Lexi)
So, what happened between
you and Victoria?

14:14.553 --> 14:15.888
I need to know.

14:15.955 --> 14:17.323
She played all, like,
these stupid games.

14:17.389 --> 14:19.692
{\an1}Vic-- Vic is-- is
definitely full of (bleep).

14:19.758 --> 14:21.227
There was one night,
my boys were like,

14:21.293 --> 14:23.562
{\an1}"Yo, like, we saw Vic
at the bar with some dude."

14:23.629 --> 14:26.098
{\an8}Yo, Victoria is 1,000%
doing my man Luis dirty.

14:26.165 --> 14:28.801
{\an8}Like, my man comes in here,

14:28.867 --> 14:31.036
chilling, like,
wanting to talk to her

14:31.103 --> 14:32.938
and she is nowhere
to be found.

14:39.078 --> 14:41.780
{\an8}Right now, with Victoria,
there is a slight potential

14:41.847 --> 14:43.215
{\an8}between me and her.

14:43.282 --> 14:44.883
I necessarily
wouldn't approach her

14:44.950 --> 14:46.752
to start that up because,
obviously,

14:46.819 --> 14:48.287
my trust isn't fully there,

14:48.354 --> 14:50.789
but if she came up to me
and made it clear

14:50.856 --> 14:53.859
that she wanted me and was
able to build up that trust,

14:53.926 --> 14:55.361
then something could
work out.

14:55.427 --> 14:57.529

23:38.650 --> 23:39.551
I don't know why
she's so tired.

23:39.618 --> 23:41.019
She don't do (bleep) all day.

23:41.086 --> 23:42.087
(giggling)

23:42.154 --> 23:43.855
FML, boy!

23:43.922 --> 23:47.025
{\an8}(narrator)
It seems like Haley doesn't have
a care in the world.

23:47.092 --> 23:48.660
{\an8}But I can't
say the same for Tor'i.

23:51.530 --> 23:52.864
{\an8}Hey...

23:55.367 --> 23:57.369
{\an7}(Tor'i)
Cut me-- that's all
I'm asking right now.

23:57.435 --> 23:59.371
Right on, bro, like,
I respect what y'all got.

23:59.437 --> 24:01.273
{\an5}Why would you wanna
go home?

23:59.437 --> 24:01.273
{\an1}I'm just saying,
I've been coming for you,

24:01.339 --> 24:03.008
{\an1}so I respect
that point of view.

24:03.074 --> 24:04.843
{\an8}(narrator)
Uh, Tor'i, you know you're
supposed to campaign

24:04.910 --> 24:07.679
{\an8}to get rid of anyone
but yourself, right?

24:07.746 --> 24:09.548
I'm not about to be
faking I got power

24:09.614 --> 24:11.149
so I'm trying
to talk to you.

24:11.216 --> 24:14.085
I honestly and truly
don't give a (bleep)

24:14.152 --> 24:15.887
about you and Angela's
relationship

24:15.954 --> 24:17.856
in terms
of a jealousy point.

24:17.923 --> 24:19.057
I really don't.

24:19.124 --> 24:21.092
{\an8}Uh, I beg to differ,
Derrick.

24:21.159 --> 24:22.527
{\an8}Roll the tape, please.

24:22.594 --> 24:24.229
I think she does has
feelings for me.

24:24.296 --> 24:25.897
{\an5}Do you still have
feelings for me?

24:24.296 --> 24:25.897
Yeah.

24:25.964 --> 24:27.699
{\an5}(Derrick)
I don't wanna close
that door all the way.

24:27.766 --> 24:29.768
Us kissing brings back
those feelings.

24:29.835 --> 24:32.304
Bro, just be 100% real.

24:32.370 --> 24:34.539
100% real of what
you interested in,

24:34.606 --> 24:36.808
inside of this house
and outside of this house.

24:36.875 --> 24:38.376
Oh my God, bro.

24:38.443 --> 24:40.579
{\an8}To the ten OGs, since day one,
I've been telling you

24:40.645 --> 24:42.247
{\an8}to get Derrick out of here.

24:42.314 --> 24:43.782
{\an8}You didn't listen to me,
you didn't have my back.

24:43.849 --> 24:46.318
Y'all got me all the way
(bleep) up.

24:46.384 --> 24:47.652
We're not
talking about cuts,

24:47.719 --> 24:49.287
we're really talking
about hearts.

24:49.354 --> 24:50.856
From day one,
you told me you was done.

24:50.922 --> 24:52.824
{\an1}You was in the confessional,
doing what you did.

24:55.861 --> 24:57.729
{\an4}What's up?

24:55.861 --> 24:57.729
I'm not about to argue
with you, man.

24:57.796 --> 25:00.031
{\an1}Look, at the end of
the day, when we leave here,

25:00.098 --> 25:01.466
I hope y'all are together.

25:01.533 --> 25:03.735
I think y'all
are a beautiful couple.

25:03.802 --> 25:05.203
(Derrick)
I'm loving this right now.

25:07.005 --> 25:08.406
{\an4}Bro, don't be--
don't be--

25:07.005 --> 25:08.406
I think y'all are great.

25:08.473 --> 25:09.708
I'm not being
(bleep) fake!

25:11.042 --> 25:12.544
{\an8}Mmm...

25:14.246 --> 25:16.781
{\an8}(narrator)
It looks like Derrick's
having a little too much fun

25:16.848 --> 25:18.116
{\an8}playing puppet master.

25:18.183 --> 25:19.517
{\an5}Don't be fake
with me, bro.

25:18.183 --> 25:19.517
I've never been fake

25:19.584 --> 25:21.286
since I've been in this
(bleep) house.

25:21.353 --> 25:23.188
{\an5}(Angela)
You're (bleep) digging
your own grave right now.

25:23.255 --> 25:24.556
Like, cut it out, yo.

25:24.623 --> 25:25.857
Like, please,
please.

25:25.924 --> 25:27.759
{\an5}Come here.

25:25.924 --> 25:27.759
{\an1}I'm digging
my own grave?

25:27.826 --> 25:29.461
You're fighting with
people that--

25:29.527 --> 25:30.729
{\an4}Come here!

25:29.527 --> 25:30.729
(Tor'i)
I'm digging my own grave?

25:30.795 --> 25:32.230
{\an1}Talk it out,
but don't (bleep)--

25:32.297 --> 25:33.865
No, yo, I'm not
kissing no ass.

25:33.932 --> 25:36.301
{\an1}I'm not telling you to but
don't fight with them either!

25:36.368 --> 25:37.936
Kick me out, yo.

25:38.003 --> 25:39.804
Take me home.

25:39.871 --> 25:41.640
{\an8}(Chris)
It's kind of like
a (bleep)-up situation.

25:41.706 --> 25:44.376
{\an8}If there was a word for
"not Gucci" like I've made,

25:44.442 --> 25:45.844
{\an8}it's not gonna go Gucci at all.

25:45.911 --> 25:46.978
I don't wanna go home

25:47.045 --> 25:48.480
{\an1}and I don't
want you to go home!

25:48.546 --> 25:50.348
Hey, my values are
way more important

25:50.415 --> 25:52.017
than "politicing"
with a broad.

25:52.083 --> 25:53.418
{\an1}You played
this (bleep) wrong.

25:53.485 --> 25:55.387
{\an1}Congratulations, you just
screwed the both of us.

25:55.453 --> 25:56.922
{\an1}He's always gonna
have a problem with Derrick.

25:56.988 --> 25:58.957
{\an4}Like, that's what
it's gonna come down to.

25:56.988 --> 25:58.957
{\an3}Yeah.

25:59.024 --> 25:59.958
{\an8}(sniffling)

26:00.025 --> 26:01.359
{\an8}So, T wants Derrick out,

26:01.426 --> 26:03.461
{\an8}but, unfortunately,
this time around,

26:03.528 --> 26:07.465
{\an8}we don't have that ability
and he's being stupid,

26:07.532 --> 26:09.401
picking a fight with
somebody that could ultimately

26:09.467 --> 26:10.835
send him, so I'm just...

26:12.103 --> 26:14.572
(sighing)

26:14.639 --> 26:16.908
{\an5}(Tor'i)
I'm not going up there
to "politic," rub elbows--

26:14.639 --> 26:16.908
Come here, though,
let me talk to you.

26:16.975 --> 26:18.643
Let me talk to you,
let me talk to you.

26:18.710 --> 26:20.946
{\an4}I'm not trying to beg
and plead to stay here, bro.

26:18.710 --> 26:20.946
Nah.

26:21.012 --> 26:22.247
And why is my girl up there

26:22.314 --> 26:24.015
trying to "politic"
for some frauds?

26:24.082 --> 26:25.617
She's not for me, bro.

26:25.684 --> 26:27.686
{\an1}She's worried about herself
at the end of the day.

26:27.752 --> 26:29.187
{\an4}I do not
understand it.

26:27.752 --> 26:29.187
No.

26:29.254 --> 26:30.455
I don't trust her.

26:30.522 --> 26:32.090
{\an1}You guys are obviously
on different pages.

26:32.157 --> 26:33.224
{\an1}Something,
man, but, I mean--

26:33.291 --> 26:34.326
I'm-- how I feel
honestly, bro--

26:34.392 --> 26:36.127
{\an1}I can't ever judge
a relationship

26:36.194 --> 26:39.130
{\an4}because
I'm not in that--

26:36.194 --> 26:39.130
But honestly, bro,
where I'm at right now--

26:39.197 --> 26:41.099
I'm genuine
and she's not.

26:41.166 --> 26:42.500
Yeah.

26:42.567 --> 26:44.636
I don't feel like somebody
got my back 100%.

26:44.703 --> 26:46.638
I feel like she fake.

26:46.705 --> 26:47.939
Yeah.

26:48.006 --> 26:49.507
{\an8}The stress of Derrick
staying in the house

26:49.574 --> 26:51.343
is getting to Angela
and Tor'i.

26:51.409 --> 26:53.845
I feel like that
stress on them as a couple

26:53.912 --> 26:55.613
is definitely tearing
them apart.

26:55.680 --> 26:58.183
{\an1}So, what's up
with you and Tor'i?

26:58.249 --> 27:00.318
{\an5}What do you mean,
what's up?

26:58.249 --> 27:00.318
{\an1}I mean, obviously
I know--

27:00.385 --> 27:02.654
{\an1}I talked to him,
but, I mean, he feels hurt.

27:02.721 --> 27:05.123
{\an1}He feels like no matter
what he does,

27:05.190 --> 27:08.326
{\an1}you're always gonna try
to put yourself before him.

27:08.393 --> 27:09.861
What is he talking about?

27:09.928 --> 27:11.563
I'm trying
to keep us both here.

27:11.629 --> 27:13.031
And that means don't
start (bleep)

27:13.098 --> 27:15.500
{\an1}with Derrick when he has
the (bleep) power right now.

27:15.567 --> 27:16.901
That's all I'm saying.

27:16.968 --> 27:18.470
{\an1}We all know Derrick still
cares about you.

27:18.536 --> 27:19.871
{\an1}We all know
that that chapter

27:19.938 --> 27:21.506
{\an4}is still open with
both of y'all.

27:19.938 --> 27:21.506
Of course.

27:21.573 --> 27:23.508
{\an1}He just feels
like he's so hurt

27:23.575 --> 27:25.477
that he's like,
"Me and Angela,

27:25.543 --> 27:26.878
{\an1}we not
gonna work out."

27:26.945 --> 27:28.179
Like, straight up.

27:28.246 --> 27:29.748
He sent you up here
to end things with me.

27:29.814 --> 27:31.916
T, you're a (bleep)

27:31.983 --> 27:32.917

39:48.753 --> 39:50.421
I did this.

39:50.488 --> 39:52.189
(crying)

39:52.256 --> 39:54.859
I wish last night
didn't happen.

39:54.925 --> 39:57.862
(sobbing)

39:59.130 --> 40:01.365
{\an8}I've seen Angela
cry before...

40:01.432 --> 40:03.434
{\an8}but tonight
it was something different.

40:03.501 --> 40:05.169
(sobbing)

40:05.236 --> 40:08.139
The bond that we created
was so great...

40:08.205 --> 40:09.607
I don't know
what she's gonna do without me.

40:09.673 --> 40:12.309
{\an8}And I have no idea what
I'm gonna do without her.

40:14.311 --> 40:16.247
♪♪

40:18.282 --> 40:21.719
Yo, it wasn't personal, man,
I just had to protect myself.

40:21.786 --> 40:23.120
That's all it was, yo.

40:23.187 --> 40:25.222
{\an8}Tomorrow, the person
that's up (bleep) creek

40:25.289 --> 40:27.591
{\an8}without the paddle
is Derrick.

40:27.658 --> 40:29.093
Angela's gonna go crazy.

40:29.160 --> 40:30.494
{\an1}(Tor'i)
All right, swole bro.

40:30.561 --> 40:33.063
{\an5}Brother.

40:30.561 --> 40:33.063
{\an1}Got you, man,
it's been a pleasure.

40:33.130 --> 40:35.299
{\an8}Tor'i and I worked out
almost every day together,

40:35.366 --> 40:37.201
{\an8}so I definitely lost
my swole mate.

40:37.268 --> 40:38.869
{\an8}Kinda sad.

40:38.936 --> 40:40.471
{\an8}(Derrick)
I just want you to know
I think you're a good guy.

40:40.538 --> 40:41.705
{\an8}It's true, I do.

40:41.772 --> 40:43.440
{\an8}It wasn't personal.

40:43.507 --> 40:45.743
{\an8}(Angela)
Derrick, don't-- please
don't ruin this moment.

40:45.810 --> 40:48.078
{\an8}Derrick, you're a fraud,
you're a fake,

40:48.145 --> 40:49.814
{\an8}and I hope you
get exposed next.

40:49.880 --> 40:51.048
{\an8}(crying)

40:51.115 --> 40:52.349
{\an8}The biggest disappointment
to me

40:52.416 --> 40:55.052
{\an8}is I won't have
Angela by my side.

40:55.119 --> 40:57.354
{\an8}Love you, T.

40:55.119 --> 40:57.354
{\an8}Love you guys, man.

40:57.421 --> 40:58.989
{\an8}(Paulie)
All right, big bro.

40:59.056 --> 41:00.658
{\an8}(Chase)
Later, Tor'i.

40:59.056 --> 41:00.658
{\an5}Be strong, y'all.

41:00.724 --> 41:02.860
{\an8}(Tor'i)
I really hope everybody
takes a lesson from this.

41:02.927 --> 41:04.562
{\an8}Make sure you guys watch out
for the exes

41:04.628 --> 41:07.164
{\an8}'cause they are always
looking for their chance

41:07.231 --> 41:09.133
{\an8}or their opportunity
to strike.

41:15.206 --> 41:21.111
{\an8}(narrator)
Next time, Victoria's secrets
get revealed in the Shack.

41:21.178 --> 41:23.981
I know damn well
that I'm going down.

41:24.048 --> 41:25.850
{\an8}And a surprise return...

41:25.916 --> 41:27.551
The bitch is back!

41:27.618 --> 41:28.919
I'm shook
to the core.

41:28.986 --> 41:30.387
{\an8}... tears the villa apart.

41:30.454 --> 41:31.522
You lied to me.

41:31.589 --> 41:33.424
Things changed
and this is--

41:33.490 --> 41:34.658
this was not real.

41:34.725 --> 41:35.693
You think I really
gotta be here?

41:35.759 --> 41:36.894
Hell no I don't.
