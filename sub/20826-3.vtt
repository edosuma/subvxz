<i>A Honeybee is always helpful,</i>

00:07.432 --> 00:09.767
<i>like bees help flowers grow.</i>

00:09.850 --> 00:11.615
<i>She is friendly and kind,</i>

00:11.616 --> 00:15.147
<i>grooms responsibly,
and rejects communism.</i>

00:15.230 --> 00:18.984
<i>She works hard, and will be
rewarded with a happy life.</i>

00:19.068 --> 00:20.486
Oh, bullshit.

00:20.569 --> 00:23.155
<i>A Honeybee always plays by the rules.</i>

00:23.238 --> 00:26.450
Okay, that's enough.
You know what, ladies?

00:26.533 --> 00:28.827
I worked hard, I played by the rules.

00:28.994 --> 00:30.454
What did it get me?

00:30.537 --> 00:33.415
I'm sitting with a bunch of little girls
in the middle of the day

00:33.499 --> 00:35.459
with a goddamn thimble on my head.

00:35.542 --> 00:38.003
I look like a Jewish leprechaun.

00:38.087 --> 00:40.339
You know what that means?
I'm not working.

00:40.422 --> 00:42.883
That means I'm not providing.
That means I'm not a man.

00:42.966 --> 00:46.421
Did you know I fought in a war?
Oh, yeah. In Korea,

00:46.456 --> 00:49.765
I shoved my sergeant's
bloody intestines back into his body.

00:49.848 --> 00:52.768
He kept yelling,
"Those aren't mine! Those aren't mine!"

00:52.851 --> 00:55.604
- Fog of war, girls!
- Oh, my God.

00:55.687 --> 00:57.439
I still can't eat kielbasa.

00:57.523 --> 00:59.191
And how am I rewarded?

00:59.274 --> 01:03.070
With a TV show called M*A*S*H
that turns the hell I went through

01:03.153 --> 01:06.448
into a bunch of doctors playing fucking
grab-ass in the Hollywood Hills!

01:06.532 --> 01:10.869
- Dad, not M*A*S*H again!
- Sorry, I'm sorry.

01:12.287 --> 01:14.331
All right, we got 30 minutes left.

01:18.127 --> 01:19.628
Let's make popcorn balls

01:19.711 --> 01:22.423
and talk about how those pansies
are giving Nixon the shaft.

What kind of dildo gets a job
that starts at five in the morning?

02:41.668 --> 02:43.962
What kind of dildo fucks his hand?

02:45.255 --> 02:47.508
- Fuck you!
- Why does your hand smell like butter?

02:47.591 --> 02:50.844
I told you to knock it off! Now, shut up
before you wake up your sister!

02:50.928 --> 02:52.596
<i>Dad, stop yelling!</i>

02:52.679 --> 02:55.766

See what you pricks did?

02:58.018 --> 03:00.729
I swear, they're trying to kill me.

03:00.812 --> 03:04.107
What's with those two?
They've been at each other's throats.

03:04.191 --> 03:06.777
Well, I have a theory,
but you're not gonna like it.

03:06.860 --> 03:08.278
It's Kevin.

03:08.362 --> 03:12.115
He's not a boy anymore and...
he's getting to that age when...

03:12.199 --> 03:14.910
- he's... you know...
- He's what?

03:14.993 --> 03:18.580
- He's gonna want to fuck something.
- Jesus, Frank!

03:18.664 --> 03:20.499
I said you weren't gonna like it.

03:20.582 --> 03:24.086
Oh, on that note,
there's no going back to sleep now.

03:24.169 --> 03:25.879
I better study my shorthand anyway.

03:25.963 --> 03:29.800
I have to take notes at the big
product development meeting today.

03:29.883 --> 03:34.263
- And you're gonna go today, right?
- Oh, Sue.

03:34.346 --> 03:37.766
Honey, there's no shame
in filing for unemployment.

03:37.849 --> 03:40.018
Sure there is. It's humiliating.

03:40.102 --> 03:42.813
I'll be down there with a bunch of hippies
with their dirty feet

03:42.896 --> 03:44.606
and their fucking Beatle-haircuts.

03:44.690 --> 03:46.400
♪ Hello, hello
Goodbye, goodbye ♪

03:46.483 --> 03:48.485
That's not a song,
it's a baby's first words!

03:48.569 --> 03:49.987
Frank, focus.

03:50.070 --> 03:52.447
I know you have your pride,
but please go down there.

03:52.531 --> 03:54.324
You paid into that system
your whole life.

03:54.408 --> 03:57.119
And they have people
who will help you apply for work.

03:57.202 --> 03:58.745
Yeah, shit work.

03:58.829 --> 04:02.082
I want to provide for this family, Sue.
And I'm looking for a real job.

04:02.165 --> 04:04.126
There's still some airlines
I haven't tried.

04:04.209 --> 04:06.128
Pogo couldn't have blackballed me
at all of them.

04:06.211 --> 04:08.088
You almost killed him, Frank.

04:08.171 --> 04:10.215
And the only thing he can reach
is his phone.

04:10.299 --> 04:12.426
I'm pretty sure
he went through his entire Rolodex.

04:12.509 --> 04:15.762
- Fucking Rolodex...
- Frank, we need the money.

04:15.846 --> 04:18.015
I'm not making as much
as you did at Mohican.

04:18.098 --> 04:20.726
Please promise me you'll go
to the employment office.

04:20.809 --> 04:23.745
Okay. Fine.
I promise.

04:23.780 --> 04:28.400
- I'll go be a leech.
- Yes, but you're my leech.

04:30.027 --> 04:32.029
Oh, Sue.

04:32.112 --> 04:33.530
Frank. Not now.

04:33.614 --> 04:35.532
Okay. Suit yourself.

04:36.533 --> 04:37.826
How about now?

04:45.846 --> 04:48.831
_

05:20.285 --> 05:22.329
Ow!

05:22.412 --> 05:25.165
Gotcha!
Pussy for a pussy!

05:25.248 --> 05:28.526
Newsflash: fuck you!

05:30.253 --> 05:33.173
Get the fuck out of the street,
you little motherfuck...

05:33.256 --> 05:35.399
Oh, hello, Bill!

05:46.019 --> 05:47.479
<i>Nothing again for you this week.</i>

05:47.562 --> 05:51.441
Look at all this deadweight,
suckling from Uncle Sam's tit.

05:51.525 --> 05:53.110
<i>Please, I need a job.</i>

05:53.193 --> 05:55.570
<i>What if I had two babies?
Would that get me more?</i>

05:55.654 --> 05:57.656
<i>- I can get another baby.
- I'm wearing rented shoes.</i>

05:57.739 --> 06:00.283
- I don't know how we'll eat this week.
- Somebody shit back here.

06:00.367 --> 06:02.786
<i>- I've come every day...
- I slept under another man for warmth.</i>

06:02.869 --> 06:05.038
Why you giving all the good jobs
to the blacks?

06:05.122 --> 06:07.541
Come on, Frank. Pucker up.

06:08.917 --> 06:11.670
- Hey, Frank Murphy!
- Oh, no.

06:11.753 --> 06:14.381
It's me, Phineas!
From the circus, remember?

06:14.464 --> 06:17.050
- We're union brothers.
- Oh, yeah, hey.

06:17.134 --> 06:21.054
So, Frank, the two-headed baby
told me you got fired at Christmas.

06:21.221 --> 06:25.434
- Yeah.
- They shut us down for animal cruelty.

06:25.517 --> 06:28.228
We've been hitting elephants
with shovels for years.

06:28.311 --> 06:31.481
But suddenly, you get
a Democrat in office...

06:31.648 --> 06:33.859
Anyway, great to see you, pal.

06:33.942 --> 06:36.278
- Yeah, listen, I...
- Fellas, this is Frank Murphy.

06:36.361 --> 06:38.905
He used to be the boss canvas man down
at the airport,

06:38.989 --> 06:41.158
pulling down some sweet alfalfa.

06:41.324 --> 06:44.786
Now he's kipping in clown alley
with no aba-daba. Ain't you, Frank?

06:44.870 --> 06:45.954
Please, stop saying my name.

06:46.037 --> 06:49.291
I understand, Frank.
Embarrassed to be here, huh?

06:49.374 --> 06:50.709
This ain't easy.

06:50.792 --> 06:53.753
The most crippling thing you'll ever do
is walk up to that window,

06:53.837 --> 06:56.089
spit up your pride and admit it:

06:56.173 --> 07:00.260
"I'm a complete failure.
I can't support my family."

07:00.343 --> 07:03.096
That's when you want to crawl
into a cannon, light the fuse...

07:03.180 --> 07:04.681
I can't do this.

07:04.764 --> 07:08.518
Where you going, Frank?
They're about to pass out lice combs.

07:13.106 --> 07:16.568
Gentlemen, Stor-a-Meal
absolutely murdered us last year.

07:16.651 --> 07:20.405
In order to compete, we'll have to do
the previously unthinkable:

07:20.489 --> 07:22.491
come up with a new and exciting product.

07:22.574 --> 07:25.035
New and exciting?

07:25.118 --> 07:27.496
- That sounds like a lot of work.
- It's easy.

07:27.579 --> 07:30.749
All we do is slap some new names
on the old product line,

07:30.832 --> 07:33.543
and those pill-popping housewives
won't know the difference.

07:33.627 --> 07:34.795
Excuse me, Tracy.

07:34.878 --> 07:39.216
I know it's not my place to interrupt,
but I am a housewife.

07:39.299 --> 07:42.052
So, if I could throw in my two cents...

07:42.135 --> 07:45.806
I'd like to throw my two cents in her.

07:45.889 --> 07:48.517
Oh, of course, Sue,
tell us what you think.

07:48.600 --> 07:50.310
We always want input from secretaries.

07:50.393 --> 07:54.064
"Ooh, ooh, look at me, I'm a girl!
I'm entitled to my own opinion!"

07:54.147 --> 07:55.357
All right, settle down.

07:55.440 --> 07:58.235
Sue has more current field
experience than any of us.

07:58.318 --> 08:01.530
It wouldn't kill us to listen to her.
Go ahead, Sue.

08:01.613 --> 08:04.950
Thank you.
Well, in my experience,

08:05.033 --> 08:08.610
the product line is a little
long in the tooth, and I believe

08:08.645 --> 08:11.581
our customers would embrace
an innovative, new product.

08:11.665 --> 08:14.459
- Such as?
- Oh, uh...

08:14.543 --> 08:17.537
I don't know exactly
what that is just yet.

08:22.926 --> 08:24.344
- Great work, Sue.
- Thank you.

08:24.427 --> 08:26.346
You just proved to me
that you have what it takes

08:26.429 --> 08:29.349

It's my fucking house!
Why aren't you at school?

09:54.059 --> 09:56.561
We got out early.
We had a teacher's meeting.

09:56.645 --> 09:58.396
It is 9:30 in the morning.

09:58.480 --> 10:01.983
- Well, it's an all-day meeting.
- Oh, bullshit!

10:26.174 --> 10:27.634
It's affecting my school work!

10:27.717 --> 10:30.345
Reading at a third grade level
is affecting your school work,

10:30.428 --> 10:31.554
you fucking dope!

10:31.638 --> 10:34.766
I hate school!
I'm not good at it!

10:34.849 --> 10:37.310
I only like playing my guitar!

10:37.394 --> 10:40.522
I'm trying to write hit records
so I can save the family,

10:40.605 --> 10:44.025
but how can I do that with fucking Bill
in the next fucking bed?!

10:44.109 --> 10:45.443
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

10:45.527 --> 10:47.404
Jesus, Kevin.
Don't have a stroke.

10:47.487 --> 10:49.906
I'm an artist and I need room to blossom!

10:49.990 --> 10:51.616
Okay, okay. Relax.

10:53.785 --> 10:55.537
You know, I remember when I was your age...

10:55.620 --> 10:57.122
This isn't fucking about you!

10:57.205 --> 10:59.124
You're right. I'm sorry.

10:59.207 --> 11:01.918
Okay, look, you don't have to go back
to school today.

11:02.002 --> 11:04.379
We'll call it a sick day.

11:04.462 --> 11:06.131
- Really?
- Yeah.

11:06.214 --> 11:07.590
Thanks, Dad.

11:07.674 --> 11:09.634
And as long as we're being honest,

11:09.718 --> 11:13.763
I did go to the employment office,
but I didn't sign up.

11:13.847 --> 11:16.307
I just left.
It was too humiliating.

11:16.391 --> 11:19.394
- Oh, man, I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

11:19.477 --> 11:21.855
And look, I understand
what you're going through.

11:21.938 --> 11:24.649
- I hated my dad too.
- I don't hate you.

11:24.733 --> 11:27.026
Well, I hated my dad.

11:30.363 --> 11:34.951
Look, Kevin, I'd love to help you with
this room situation, but what can I do?

11:35.034 --> 11:37.829
- I can't put Bill in with Maureen.
- Well, then it's hopeless!

11:37.912 --> 11:42.041
The fucking dog has his own house!
There's no place for me!

11:43.460 --> 11:45.207
This could be a place for me.

11:46.337 --> 11:49.424
Oh, Kevin. You can't live here.
It's full of junk.

11:49.507 --> 11:53.136
- It's a blank canvas.
- A canvas smeared with mold.

11:53.219 --> 11:55.889
- I love it.
- Do you smell gas?

11:55.972 --> 11:57.766
I smell freedom.

12:01.811 --> 12:06.566
When you pour your coffee in it,
the Rainbow Mug changes color,

12:06.649 --> 12:10.028
thanks to the hundreds of chemicals
in the plastic.

12:10.111 --> 12:11.404
You get all that, Sue?

12:11.488 --> 12:12.989
- Yes.
- Good.

12:13.072 --> 12:15.241
Now eat it, shit it out,

12:15.325 --> 12:18.536
burn the shit and bury the shit ashes.

12:18.620 --> 12:20.955
Yeah, that was a shitty idea.

12:21.039 --> 12:23.750
- Whose was it? Whose was it?
- I'm just kidding, Sue.

12:23.833 --> 12:25.543
Put that in the bad idea folder.

12:25.627 --> 12:29.266
I'd like to put a bad idea
in Sue's folder!

12:29.547 --> 12:31.925
- How does he do it?
- Okay, that's it.

12:32.008 --> 12:33.676
I'm not trying to be a square.

12:33.760 --> 12:36.638
My kids happen to think I'm very cool,
but enough is enough.

12:37.722 --> 12:41.038
- I am not gonna take any more of this...
- Afternoon, gentlemen.

12:41.039 --> 12:42.560
Vivian! What's shaking, honey?

12:42.644 --> 12:46.189
Aside from those two milk sacs
you got hanging off your chest.

12:46.272 --> 12:47.482
You know something?

12:47.565 --> 12:50.276
That type of language
is crude and inappropriate

12:50.360 --> 12:52.695
- for a professional setting.
- Oh, thank God.

12:52.779 --> 12:55.093
So, why don't you have some class,

12:55.094 --> 12:57.408
you limp-dicked San
Francisco cocksuckers?

12:57.492 --> 12:59.326
Whoo-hoo!

13:00.036 --> 13:02.705
Vivian, you crazy, lovable whore!

13:02.789 --> 13:05.375
Well, Tracy, if I was selling it,

13:05.376 --> 13:08.417
I'd give you the under
four-inch discount.

13:08.753 --> 13:10.255
And if you ever do fuck me,

13:10.338 --> 13:13.466
leave a note down there
so I know you dropped by.

13:13.550 --> 13:15.552
Okay, I'll leave it on the piano.

13:17.470 --> 13:20.515
- The piano!
- You big-pussied bitch!

13:23.142 --> 13:27.313
- Too far?
- Jesus, Gene. Let's take ten.

13:27.397 --> 13:29.816
Enjoy your circle jerk,
you taint sniffers.

13:33.695 --> 13:36.322
- Okay, you can thank me now.
- Thank you for what?

13:36.406 --> 13:38.950
- For saving your job.
- Those men are all pigs.

13:39.033 --> 13:41.661
Yes and you better get past it
if you want to stay here.

13:41.744 --> 13:44.414
This is their game,
and we have to play along.

13:44.497 --> 13:46.666
Hey, Viv, do you know where
my three-hole punch is?

13:46.749 --> 13:49.595
I don't know, Dana.
Did you check your twat?

13:49.975 --> 13:52.052
Yeah. Yeah...

13:52.714 --> 13:54.340
That's all there is to it. Hm?

13:54.424 --> 13:56.801
They give you shit,
you give it right back.

13:56.885 --> 13:58.428
But he wasn't giving you any shit.

13:58.511 --> 14:00.680
He was treating me like his fucking maid.

14:00.763 --> 14:03.558
You think he asked any men
to help find his three-hole punch?

14:03.641 --> 14:06.185
And I've got more seniority than him.

14:06.269 --> 14:09.772
Now listen, I stuck my neck out
to get you in here.

14:09.856 --> 14:12.650
Don't disappoint me.
Play the game.

14:12.734 --> 14:16.362
I don't think I can do that.
It's just not who I am.

14:16.446 --> 14:21.284
Well, "who I am" isn't going to buy
you ten cents worth of groceries.

14:21.367 --> 14:23.494
All right, boys,
we've got plastic to sell.

14:23.578 --> 14:26.122
Wipe the jizz off your chins
and get in here.

14:26.206 --> 14:28.458
<i>"Jizz off my chin!"</i>

14:33.171 --> 14:34.422
Okay!

14:35.506 --> 14:37.258
Yeah, no more babies in this house.

14:37.259 --> 14:40.970
- Won't make that mistake a fourth time.
- Stupid Electric Football.

14:41.054 --> 14:43.765
Dildos just went around in circles anyway.

14:43.848 --> 14:45.850
Oh, there's lots of room in here now!

14:45.934 --> 14:48.436
- I can almost lie down.
- All right, Kevin.

14:48.519 --> 14:51.749
I will fix this up for you,
but if you cut class again

14:51.784 --> 14:53.900
and lie about it, I will
bury you in the backyard.

14:54.025 --> 14:57.237
And I will rise up, through my music!

14:57.320 --> 15:00.612
- Kevin.
- Right. I know. Stay in school.

15:00.647 --> 15:04.118
"A real man never lies.
Stop stealing change off your dresser."

15:04.202 --> 15:07.080
I fucking knew that was you.

15:10.250 --> 15:12.585
Oh, wow!
Dad, is this you and Mom?

15:13.336 --> 15:16.547
- You almost look happy.
- That's because you weren't born yet.

15:19.259 --> 15:22.720
- I sure ruined your life.
- Yes! You did!

15:25.598 --> 15:28.601
Are you enjoying your time as a newsie?

15:28.685 --> 15:30.728
I don't like getting up early,

15:30.812 --> 15:33.147
but it's all worth it
because today I get paid.

15:33.231 --> 15:34.649
How much do you make?

15:34.732 --> 15:35.692
I don't know yet.

15:35.775 --> 15:37.193
But the first thing I'm gonna do is,

15:37.277 --> 15:39.570
I'm gonna get the hockey stick
that Jacques Dupuis uses.

15:39.654 --> 15:42.532
And if Kevin breaks this one,
I'll kill him in his sleep.

15:42.615 --> 15:46.786
My parents won't let me play hockey,
but my nana's teaching me bridge.

15:46.869 --> 15:49.372
Those women are brutal.

15:49.455 --> 15:53.001
Well, this is where my newspaper boss
told me to meet him.

15:55.169 --> 15:57.672
- Hi, Randy.
- Hey, you, freckles!

15:57.755 --> 16:01.050
Right on time.
You're doing a great job on the route.

16:01.134 --> 16:03.386
Way better than the last asshole
who had it.

16:03.469 --> 16:06.889
- Who was that?
- Me! Right?

16:07.473 --> 16:09.767
- Who's this little fruit pie?
- Hello.

16:09.851 --> 16:12.395
So... I guess this is when
you pay me, right?

16:13.604 --> 16:17.567
No, you pay me and then I pay you.
Here's your collection book.

16:17.692 --> 16:20.653
Wait, I have to collect the money?

16:20.737 --> 16:24.115
Yep. Welcome to the wonderful world
of selling weed.

16:24.198 --> 16:25.450
You mean papers?

16:25.533 --> 16:28.411
I prefer to use a bong filled
with embalming fluid.

16:28.494 --> 16:30.121
That's how the pharaohs did it.

16:30.204 --> 16:33.124
- You'll do great. Most people will pay.
- Most?

16:33.207 --> 16:36.294
If you have any trouble,
just bring Poindexter here for backup.

16:36.377 --> 16:40.715
Maybe he can drop his microscope
on the deadbeat's foot.

16:40.840 --> 16:44.135
I would never do that
to a precision instrument.

16:44.218 --> 16:46.929
Are you a cop?
You have to tell me if you're a cop!

16:47.013 --> 16:49.599
No, I don't.
That's a popular misconception!

16:52.185 --> 16:53.811
I could make this work, Frank.

16:53.895 --> 16:57.398
Rig up some wiring, spray some asbestos,

16:57.482 --> 17:01.527
slap on some lead paint.
Kevin, you'll be in heaven in no time.

17:01.611 --> 17:03.237
Thanks, Babe. You're a lifesaver.

17:03.321 --> 17:05.114
<i>Oh, there you are, Frank.</i>

17:05.198 --> 17:07.532
I got worried when I didn't
see anybody through the windows.

17:07.617 --> 17:12.079
We're making this my room,
slash love palace, slash recording studio.

17:12.163 --> 17:14.935
That's great.
You shoot for the stars, son.

17:14.936 --> 17:18.044
Never give up on your dreams.
Never give up.

17:21.130 --> 17:23.340
Four dudes in a basement,
you know it's a party.

17:23.424 --> 17:24.967
Come on down, Vic!

17:25.050 --> 17:28.262
Ooh, Canadian! Should I save
this for a special occasion?

17:28.346 --> 17:31.516
- Life's a special occasion, Babe.
- Aren't you gonna drink with us?

17:31.599 --> 17:35.353
No can do, fellas. I got a big meeting
with my new boss at the radio station.

17:35.436 --> 17:38.689
Got to keep my mind clear
and stay focused.

17:38.773 --> 17:41.818
- Jesus, Vic!
- Oh, this is much better than Jesus!

17:41.901 --> 17:45.154
Are you listening
to forbidden jazz music?

17:45.238 --> 17:47.907
- Hey, Mr. Hitlerburger!
- Sorry, it's a little cramped.

17:47.990 --> 17:51.160
This is a palace compared
to some basements I've lived in.

17:51.244 --> 17:53.538
No way!
You had your own room too?

17:53.621 --> 17:56.124
I shared it with 14 others.

17:56.207 --> 17:58.292
Sounds like a non-stop party to me!

17:58.376 --> 18:03.548
Actually, we were all very quiet.
Most of the time.

18:06.050 --> 18:07.093
Oh, I get it.

18:08.386 --> 18:11.681
It was one of those
"shut up and fuck" parties!

18:15.393 --> 18:19.564
All right, so I expect five
new product ideas from each of you

18:19.647 --> 18:21.107
by a week from Monday.

18:21.190 --> 18:24.444
Whoever comes up with the winner
gets a $10 bonus,

18:24.527 --> 18:27.488
or ten free minutes at that whorehouse
down by the quarry.

18:27.572 --> 18:31.951
Well, you thimble-dicked queers
don't stand a chance against me.

18:32.034 --> 18:33.786
Vivian!

18:33.870 --> 18:34.871
Wait, wait.

18:34.954 --> 18:38.124
We can't close this meeting yet,
not till Sue weighs in.

18:38.207 --> 18:42.879
Sue, do you have any more thoughts you
want to fart out of your ears, sweetheart?

18:44.422 --> 18:47.675
Uh-oh! Look what you did.
You made Sue upset.

18:47.758 --> 18:49.051
Here we go again.

18:49.135 --> 18:51.262
Looks like I got another quitter
on my hands.

18:51.345 --> 18:54.932
<i>Don't cry! Don't cry!
Don't cry! Don't cry!</i>

18:55.016 --> 18:58.936
Listen, I do have something
I'd like to say.

18:59.020 --> 19:01.856
You guys may think
you're the bee's knees.

19:02.440 --> 19:05.026
But I feel sorry for you.

19:05.526 --> 19:10.907
Because you are all just a bunch
of ignorant, small-minded...

19:14.952 --> 19:16.824
cockpeople!

19:21.584 --> 19:22.919
Ohh!

19:23.002 --> 19:25.379
Sue Murphy!
"Cockpeople!"

19:25.463 --> 19:27.548
- I love it!
- Sue Murphy!

19:27.632 --> 19:29.670
She's a keeper!

19:55.826 --> 19:59.372
Not bad, Red. How do you want
your cut: money or weed?

19:59.455 --> 20:03.918
My mom says that weeds
are the desperados of the garden.

20:04.001 --> 20:06.337
Kid, you're not gonna get laid
for a long time.

20:06.420 --> 20:10.007
Let's see. This is for the paper,
this is for me,

20:10.091 --> 20:13.594
insurance, delivery fee,
twine fee, folding fee,

20:13.678 --> 20:15.805
annual dues, stadium tax.

20:15.888 --> 20:19.642
Here's your cut, $5.17.

20:21.936 --> 20:25.439
<i>It's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.</i>

20:26.440 --> 20:30.152
<i>Of all the shoulders in all of the world, 
you had to sit on mine</i>

20:30.236 --> 20:33.906
<i>the one day I get invited
to play golf with the boss.</i>

20:33.990 --> 20:36.492
<i>I'm just trying to earn my wings.</i>

20:36.576 --> 20:39.245
<i>And you know brothers love wings!</i>

20:40.288 --> 20:42.540
Ha-ha!
Yes, they do. It's true.

20:42.623 --> 20:43.916
- Hey, Mom!
- Mom!

20:44.000 --> 20:45.170
- Sue!
- Mommie!

20:45.235 --> 20:47.336
- Hey.
- Mom, I got my first five bucks

20:47.337 --> 20:48.838
towards my hockey stick.

20:48.921 --> 20:51.841
I'm working on a new song.
It's got a minor chord in it.

20:51.924 --> 20:54.969
Mommy, a policeman came to talk
to Mr. Goomer today!

20:55.052 --> 20:57.722
What's going on here?
Why is everyone so happy?

20:57.805 --> 20:58.889
<i>We had a great day.</i>

20:58.973 --> 21:02.935
<i>I think I might've come up with a way
to solve the Bill and Kevin situation.</i>

21:03.019 --> 21:05.563
<i>We're turning the basement
into my private sanctuary.</i>

21:05.646 --> 21:07.565
Wow, that would be a pretty big move.

21:07.648 --> 21:10.901
I had a rough day at work. I'm not
ready to discuss this right now.

21:10.985 --> 21:12.403
I'm gonna run a bath.

21:13.821 --> 21:16.394
You already threw stuff out of there?!

21:16.741 --> 21:18.200
I just got the ball rolling.

21:18.284 --> 21:20.745
I got me a toilet vest.

21:20.828 --> 21:24.415
I'm Daddy going to one
of his ghost meetings.

21:24.498 --> 21:28.794
- Shoo! Shoo! Get out!
- I can't see what we's running from!

21:29.670 --> 21:32.298
Were you even gonna run this by me?

21:32.381 --> 21:35.468
I wanted to see the look on your
face and... now I've seen it.

21:35.551 --> 21:39.472
How did you get all this work done
today anyway? Did you go to school?

21:39.555 --> 21:43.684
- Yeah, I did.
- Kevin. Tell me the truth.

21:43.768 --> 21:47.688
"A real man never lies."
No, I didn't go.

21:47.772 --> 21:49.065
Well, that's just great!

21:49.148 --> 21:52.026
And I suppose you didn't go
to the employment office?

21:58.240 --> 22:00.868
Hell yes, I did!
And I resent the question!

22:01.827 --> 22:04.872
So you went?
You filed for unemployment?

22:04.955 --> 22:07.667
Of course I did!
I was there all morning!

22:07.750 --> 22:11.045
And I applied for jobs
that I am waiting to hear about!

22:11.128 --> 22:14.632
Then I come home, I discover
40 square feet we didn't know we had.

22:14.715 --> 22:16.550
And what thanks do I get?

22:16.634 --> 22:20.604
You give me the third degree
in front of my children.

22:23.808 --> 22:27.766
Oh, I'm sorry, Frank.
I had a hard day.

22:27.801 --> 22:29.980
Thank you for doing what you promised.

22:32.191 --> 22:34.360
Yeah, I said I was gonna do it,
and I did it.

22:34.443 --> 22:37.446
- That's what a real man does.
- Of course you did.

22:38.406 --> 22:40.574
You can learn something from your father.

22:41.409 --> 22:44.995
Oh, I learned something.
Liar!

22:46.330 --> 22:50.126
<i>Real man, my ass.
Fucking dick!</i>

22:55.840 --> 22:59.885
Honey, I'm sorry again for thinking you
didn't sign up at the employment office.

23:00.511 --> 23:03.097
I shouldn't have taken
my bad day out on you.

23:03.180 --> 23:06.392
Well, I think
I've done that once or twice.

23:07.017 --> 23:08.144
Good night!

23:10.104 --> 23:14.275
- Frank, I hate my job.
- God, I miss that feeling.

23:14.358 --> 23:15.776
But I'm not going to quit.

23:15.860 --> 23:18.446
I'll do whatever it takes
to put bread on the table,

23:18.529 --> 23:21.157
- just like you did today.
- Ah. It was nothing.

23:21.866 --> 23:25.286
Sue, I'm a little tired.
I'm gonna turn in.

23:29.123 --> 23:31.208
I missed you today.

23:32.585 --> 23:34.795
I work with such animals.

23:36.130 --> 23:38.340
God, you're a real man.

23:38.924 --> 23:42.011
- A good man.
- Oh, I'm okay.

23:43.220 --> 23:45.556
Remember this morning,
what you wanted to do?

23:46.640 --> 23:48.768
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, Frank.

23:48.851 --> 23:50.019
Oh, Frank!

23:50.978 --> 23:53.856
- Oh, God, Sue.
- Oh, oh, my God.

23:53.939 --> 23:56.692
Oh, you're such a good man.
Honest and good.

23:56.776 --> 23:59.487
Tell me you're my good man!

23:59.570 --> 24:02.031
- I'm okay.
- No, you're a good man!

24:02.114 --> 24:04.700
So dependable and trustworthy!

24:04.783 --> 24:07.620
A role model to your children!

24:07.703 --> 24:10.915
- You keep your promises!
- Talk about other stuff, Sue!

24:10.998 --> 24:13.751
Oh. Oh, no.
What's wrong, honey?

24:14.460 --> 24:15.753
Did I do something?

24:15.836 --> 24:19.840
No. It's not you. It's...
It's nothing. It's nothing.

24:19.924 --> 24:22.468
- Frank, what is it?
- I...

24:22.551 --> 24:24.887
I'm just tired.
Sorry.

24:28.224 --> 24:31.352
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

24:32.645 --> 24:34.745
I fucking hate myself.

24:35.064 --> 24:38.651

Mr. Greenwood, my name's Frank Murphy.

24:58.963 --> 25:02.380
My friend, Rosie,
gave me your number and...

25:03.259 --> 25:04.969
I really need a job.

25:05.848 --> 25:08.303
I need one bad.

You're the wizard, you dildo.

25:24.029 --> 25:27.074

25:27.157 --> 25:29.702
Like a candle's flame.

25:33.497 --> 25:34.832
Well, you're all wired up, Kevin.

25:36.083 --> 25:38.043
I need privacy!

25:38.127 --> 25:40.880
<i>Yeah, this wiring
will last you a good long while.</i>

25:40.963 --> 25:44.216
<i>You could hook up a space heater
in here, maybe even a jukebox.</i>

25:44.300 --> 25:46.594
<i>Hey, that was nice of Vic bringing
those Canadian beers, wasn't it?</i>

25:46.677 --> 25:49.388
<i>Hey, does he ever invite you over
to go swimming? Boy, that'd be fun.</i>

25:49.471 --> 25:51.348
<i>- Shut up.
- Hey, next time you go over there,</i>

25:51.432 --> 25:53.142
<i>let me know, will ya?
I wouldn't have to swim.</i>

25:53.225 --> 25:55.978
<i>I could just sit there and watch.
Yeah, I wouldn't say a word.</i>

25:56.061 --> 26:00.741
<i>I'd just, you know, sip a beverage
or eat some pretzels... and be real still.</i>

26:01.108 --> 26:05.112
<i>Yeah, I'm good at that. When I was
in high school I got voted "Most Quiet."</i>

26:05.195 --> 26:08.845
<i>- Shut the fuck up!
- Boy, those were the great days.</i>

26:08.846 --> 26:10.576
